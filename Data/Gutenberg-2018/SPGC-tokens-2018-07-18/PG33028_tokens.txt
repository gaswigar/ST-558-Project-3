man
and

i
the
haunted
inheritance
the
most
extraordinary
thing
that
ever
happened
to
me
was
my
going
back
to
town
on
that
day
i
am
a
reasonable
being
i
do
not
do
such
things
i
was
on
a
bicycling
tour
with
another
man
we
were
far
from
the
mean
cares
of
an
unremunerative
profession
we
were
men
not
fettered
by
any
given
address
any
pledged
date
any
preconcerted
route
i
went
to
bed
weary
and
cheerful
fell
asleep
a
mere
animal
a
tired
dog
after
a
hunting
and
awoke
at
four
in
the
morning
that
creature
of
nerves
and
fancies
which
is
my
other
self
and
which
has
driven
me
to
all
the
follies
i
have
ever
kept
company
with
but
even
that
second
self
of
mine
whining
beast
and
traitor
as
it
is
has
never
played
me
such
a
trick
as
it
played
then
indeed
something
in
the
result
of
that
rash
act
sets
me
wondering
whether
after
all
it
could
have
been
i
or
even
my
other
self
who
moved
in
the
adventure
whether
it
was
not
rather
some
power
outside
both
of
us
but
this
is
a
speculation
as
idle
in
me
as
uninteresting
to
you
and
so
enough
of
it
from
four
to
seven
i
lay
awake
the
prey
of
a
growing
detestation
of
bicycling
tours
friends
scenery
physical
exertion
holidays
by
seven
i
felt
that
i
would
rather
perish
than
spend
another
day
in
the
society
of
the
other
man
an
excellent
fellow
by
the
way
and
the
best
of
company
at
seven
the
post
came
i
saw
the
postman
through
my
window
as
i
shaved
i
went
down
to
get
my
letters
there
were
none
naturally
at
breakfast
i
said
edmundson
my
dear
fellow
i
am
extremely
sorry
but
my
letters
this
morning
compel
me
to
return
to
town
at
once
but
i
thought
said
edmundson
then
he
stopped
and
i
saw
that
he
had
perceived
in
time
that
this
was
no
moment
for
reminding
me
that
having
left
no
address
i
could
have
had
no
letters
he
looked
sympathetic
and
gave
me
what
there
was
left
of
the
bacon
i
suppose
he
thought
that
it
was
a
love
affair
or
some
such
folly
i
let
him
think
so
after
all
no
love
affair
but
would
have
seemed
wise
compared
with
the
blank
idiocy
of
this
sudden
determination
to
cut
short
a
delightful
holiday
and
go
back
to
those
dusty
stuffy
rooms
in
inn
after
that
first
and
almost
pardonable
lapse
edmundson
behaved
beautifully
i
caught
the
train
and
by
eleven
i
was
climbing
my
dirty
staircase
i
let
myself
in
and
waded
through
a
heap
of
envelopes
and
wrappered
circulars
that
had
drifted
in
through
the
as
dead
leaves
drift
into
the
areas
of
houses
in
squares
all
the
windows
were
shut
dust
lay
thick
on
everything
my
laundress
had
evidently
chosen
this
as
a
good
time
for
her
holiday
i
wondered
idly
where
she
spent
it
and
now
the
close
musty
smell
of
the
rooms
caught
at
my
senses
and
i
remembered
with
a
positive
pang
the
sweet
scent
of
the
earth
and
the
dead
leaves
in
that
wood
through
which
at
this
very
moment
the
sensible
and
fortunate
edmundson
would
be
riding
the
thought
of
dead
leaves
reminded
me
of
the
heap
of
correspondence
i
glanced
through
it
only
one
of
all
those
letters
interested
me
in
the
least
it
was
from
my
mother
elliot
bay
norfolk
dear
lawrence
i
have
wonderful
news
for
you
your
sefton
has
died
and
left
you
half
his
immense
property
the
other
half
is
left
to
your
second
cousin
selwyn
you
must
come
home
at
once
there
are
heaps
of
letters
here
for
you
but
i
dare
not
send
them
on
as
goodness
only
knows
where
you
may
be
i
do
wish
you
would
remember
to
leave
an
address
i
send
this
to
your
rooms
in
case
you
have
had
the
forethought
to
instruct
your
charwoman
to
send
your
letters
on
to
you
it
is
a
most
handsome
fortune
and
i
am
too
happy
about
your
accession
to
it
to
scold
you
as
you
deserve
but
i
hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
to
leave
an
address
when
next
you
go
away
come
home
at
your
loving
mother
margaret
sefton
it
is
the
maddest
will
everything
divided
evenly
between
you
two
except
the
house
and
estate
the
will
says
you
and
your
cousin
selwyn
are
to
meet
there
on
the
september
following
his
death
in
presence
of
the
family
and
decide
which
of
you
is
to
have
the
house
if
you
ca
agree
it
to
be
presented
to
the
county
for
a
lunatic
asylum
i
should
think
so
he
was
always
so
eccentric
the
one
who
does
have
the
house
gets
extra
of
course
you
will
choose
be
sure
to
bring
your
with
you
the
air
here
is
very
keen
of
an
evening
i
opened
both
the
windows
and
lit
a
pipe
sefton
manor
that
gorgeous
old
place
i
knew
its
picture
in
hasted
cradle
of
our
race
and
so
on
and
a
big
fortune
i
hoped
my
cousin
selwyn
would
want
the
more
than
he
wanted
the
house
if
he
did
well
perhaps
my
fortune
might
be
large
enough
to
increase
that
to
a
sum
that
he
want
and
then
suddenly
i
became
aware
that
this
was
the
of
august
and
that
was
the
day
on
which
i
was
to
meet
my
cousin
selwyn
and
the
family
and
come
to
a
decision
about
the
house
i
had
never
to
my
knowledge
heard
of
my
cousin
selwyn
we
were
a
family
rich
in
collateral
branches
i
hoped
he
would
be
a
reasonable
young
man
also
i
had
never
seen
sefton
manor
house
except
in
a
print
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
rather
see
the
house
before
i
saw
the
cousin
i
caught
the
next
train
to
sefton
it
but
a
mile
by
the
field
way
said
the
railway
porter
you
take
the
stile
the
first
on
the
left
and
follow
the
path
till
you
come
to
the
wood
then
skirt
along
the
left
of
it
cater
across
the
meadow
at
the
end
and
you
see
the
place
right
below
you
in
the
vale
it
a
fine
old
place
i
hear
said
i
all
to
pieces
though
said
he
i
should
wonder
if
it
cost
a
couple
o
hundred
to
put
it
to
rights
water
coming
through
the
roof
and
all
but
surely
the
owner
oh
he
never
lived
there
not
since
his
son
was
taken
he
lived
in
the
lodge
it
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
looking
down
on
the
manor
house
is
the
house
empty
as
empty
as
a
rotten
nutshell
except
for
the
old
sticks
o
furniture
any
one
who
likes
added
the
porter
can
lie
there
o
nights
but
it
would
be
me
do
you
mean
there
a
ghost
i
hope
i
kept
any
note
of
undue
elation
out
of
my
voice
i
do
hold
with
ghosts
said
the
porter
firmly
but
my
aunt
was
in
service
at
the
lodge
and
there
no
doubt
but
walks
there
come
i
said
this
is
very
interesting
ca
you
leave
the
station
and
come
across
to
where
beer
is
i
do
mind
if
i
do
said
he
that
is
so
far
as
your
standing
a
drop
goes
but
i
ca
leave
the
station
so
if
you
pour
my
beer
you
must
pour
it
dry
sir
as
the
saying
is
so
i
gave
the
man
a
shilling
and
he
told
me
about
the
ghost
at
sefton
manor
house
indeed
about
the
ghosts
for
there
were
it
seemed
two
a
lady
in
white
and
a
gentleman
in
a
slouch
hat
and
black
riding
cloak
they
do
say
said
my
porter
as
how
one
of
the
young
ladies
once
on
a
time
was
wishful
to
elope
and
started
so
to
do
not
getting
further
than
the
hall
door
her
father
thinking
it
to
be
burglars
fired
out
of
the
window
and
the
happy
pair
fell
on
the
doorstep
corpses
is
it
true
do
you
think
the
porter
did
not
know
at
any
rate
there
was
a
tablet
in
the
church
to
maria
sefton
and
george
ballard
and
something
about
in
their
death
them
not
being
divided
i
took
the
stile
i
skirted
the
wood
i
catered
across
the
meadow
and
so
i
came
out
on
a
chalky
ridge
held
in
a
net
of
pine
roots
where
dog
violets
grew
below
stretched
the
green
park
dotted
with
trees
the
lodge
stuccoed
but
solid
lay
below
me
smoke
came
from
its
chimneys
lower
still
lay
the
manor
house
red
brick
with
grey
lichened
mullions
a
house
in
a
thousand
elizabethan
and
from
its
twisted
beautiful
chimneys
no
smoke
arose
i
hurried
across
the
short
turf
towards
the
manor
house
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
into
the
great
garden
the
bricks
of
the
wall
were
everywhere
displaced
or
crumbling
the
ivy
had
forced
the
coping
stones
away
each
red
buttress
offered
a
dozen
spots
for
foothold
i
climbed
the
wall
and
found
myself
in
a
garden
oh
but
such
a
garden
there
are
not
half
a
dozen
such
in
england
ancient
box
hedges
rosaries
fountains
yew
tree
avenues
bowers
of
clematis
now
feathery
in
its
seeding
time
great
trees
marble
balustrades
and
steps
terraces
green
lawns
one
green
lawn
in
especial
girt
round
with
a
sweet
briar
hedge
and
in
the
middle
of
this
lawn
a
sundial
all
this
was
mine
or
to
be
more
exact
might
be
mine
should
my
cousin
selwyn
prove
to
be
a
person
of
sense
how
i
prayed
that
he
might
not
be
a
person
of
taste
that
he
might
be
a
person
who
liked
yachts
or
racehorses
or
diamonds
or
or
anything
that
money
can
buy
not
a
person
who
liked
beautiful
elizabethan
houses
and
gardens
old
beyond
belief
the
sundial
stood
on
a
mass
of
masonry
too
low
and
wide
to
be
called
a
pillar
i
mounted
the
two
brick
steps
and
leaned
over
to
read
the
date
and
the
motto
tempus
fugit
manet
amor
the
date
was
the
initials
surmounted
it
the
face
of
the
dial
was
unusually
ornate
a
wreath
of
stiffly
drawn
roses
was
traced
outside
the
circle
of
the
numbers
as
i
leaned
there
a
sudden
movement
on
the
other
side
of
the
pedestal
compelled
my
attention
i
leaned
over
a
little
further
to
see
what
had
rustled
a
rat
a
rabbit
a
flash
of
pink
struck
at
my
eyes
a
lady
in
a
pink
dress
was
sitting
on
the
step
at
the
other
side
of
the
sundial
i
suppose
some
exclamation
escaped
me
the
lady
looked
up
her
hair
was
dark
and
her
eyes
her
face
was
pink
and
white
with
a
few
little
freckles
on
nose
and
on
cheek
bones
her
dress
was
of
pink
cotton
stuff
thin
and
soft
she
looked
like
a
beautiful
pink
rose
our
eyes
met
i
beg
your
pardon
said
i
i
had
no
idea
there
i
stopped
and
tried
to
crawl
back
to
firm
ground
graceful
explanations
are
not
best
given
by
one
sprawling
on
his
stomach
across
a
sundial
by
the
time
i
was
once
more
on
my
feet
she
too
was
standing
it
is
a
beautiful
old
place
she
said
gently
and
as
it
seemed
with
a
kindly
wish
to
relieve
my
embarrassment
she
made
a
movement
as
if
to
turn
away
quite
a
show
place
said
i
stupidly
enough
but
i
was
still
a
little
embarrassed
and
i
wanted
to
say
something
anything
to
arrest
her
departure
you
have
no
idea
how
pretty
she
was
she
had
a
straw
hat
in
her
hand
dangling
by
soft
black
ribbons
her
hair
was
all
like
a
child
i
suppose
you
have
seen
the
house
i
asked
she
paused
one
foot
still
on
the
lower
step
of
the
sundial
and
her
face
seemed
to
brighten
at
the
touch
of
some
idea
as
sudden
as
welcome
well
no
she
said
the
fact
is
i
wanted
frightfully
to
see
the
house
in
fact
i
come
miles
and
miles
on
purpose
but
there
no
one
to
let
me
in
the
people
at
the
lodge
i
suggested
oh
no
she
said
i
the
fact
is
i
i
do
want
to
be
shown
round
i
want
to
explore
she
looked
at
me
critically
her
eyes
dwelt
on
my
right
hand
which
lay
on
the
sundial
i
have
always
taken
reasonable
care
of
my
hands
and
i
wore
a
good
ring
a
sapphire
cut
with
the
sefton
arms
an
heirloom
by
the
way
her
glance
at
my
hand
preluded
a
longer
glance
at
my
face
then
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
oh
well
she
said
and
it
was
as
if
she
had
said
plainly
i
see
that
you
are
a
gentleman
and
a
decent
fellow
why
should
i
not
look
over
the
house
in
your
company
introductions
bah
all
this
her
shrug
said
without
ambiguity
as
without
words
perhaps
i
hazarded
i
could
get
the
keys
do
you
really
care
very
much
for
old
houses
i
do
said
i
and
you
i
care
so
much
that
i
nearly
broke
into
this
one
i
should
have
done
it
quite
if
the
windows
had
been
an
inch
or
two
lower
i
am
an
inch
or
two
higher
said
i
standing
squarely
so
as
to
make
the
most
of
my
beside
her
or
thereabouts
oh
if
you
only
would
said
she
why
not
said
i
she
led
the
way
past
the
marble
basin
of
the
fountain
and
along
the
historic
yew
avenue
planted
like
all
old
yew
avenues
by
that
industrious
gardener
our
eighth
henry
then
across
a
lawn
through
a
winding
grassy
shrubbery
path
that
ended
at
a
green
door
in
the
garden
wall
you
can
lift
this
latch
with
a
hairpin
said
she
and
therewith
lifted
it
we
walked
into
a
courtyard
young
grass
grew
green
between
the
grey
flags
on
which
our
steps
echoed
this
is
the
window
said
she
you
see
there
a
pane
broken
if
you
could
get
on
to
the
you
could
get
your
hand
in
and
undo
the
hasp
and
and
you
oh
you
let
me
in
by
the
kitchen
door
i
did
it
my
conscience
called
me
a
burglar
in
vain
was
it
not
my
own
or
as
good
as
my
own
house
i
let
her
in
at
the
back
door
we
walked
through
the
big
dark
kitchen
where
the
old
pot
towered
large
on
the
hearth
and
the
old
spits
and
firedogs
still
kept
their
ancient
place
then
through
another
kitchen
where
red
rust
was
making
its
full
meal
of
a
comparatively
modern
range
then
into
the
great
hall
where
the
old
armour
and
the
and
hang
on
the
walls
and
where
the
carved
stone
staircases
run
at
each
side
up
to
the
gallery
above
the
long
tables
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
were
scored
by
the
knives
of
the
many
who
had
eaten
meat
there
initials
and
dates
were
cut
into
them
the
roof
was
groined
the
windows
oh
but
what
a
place
said
she
this
must
be
much
older
than
the
rest
of
it
evidently
about
i
should
say
oh
let
us
explore
the
rest
she
cried
it
is
really
a
comfort
not
to
have
a
guide
but
only
a
person
like
you
who
just
guesses
comfortably
at
dates
i
should
hate
to
be
told
when
this
hall
was
built
we
explored
and
picture
gallery
white
parlour
and
library
most
of
the
rooms
were
furnished
all
heavily
some
magnificently
but
everything
was
dusty
and
faded
it
was
in
the
white
parlour
a
spacious
panelled
room
on
the
first
floor
that
she
told
me
the
ghost
story
substantially
the
same
as
my
porter
tale
only
in
one
respect
different
and
so
just
as
she
was
leaving
this
very
room
yes
i
sure
it
this
room
because
the
woman
at
the
inn
pointed
out
this
double
window
and
told
me
so
just
as
the
poor
lovers
were
creeping
out
of
the
door
the
cruel
father
came
quickly
out
of
some
dark
place
and
killed
them
both
so
now
they
haunt
it
it
is
a
terrible
thought
said
i
gravely
how
would
you
like
to
live
in
a
haunted
house
i
could
she
said
quickly
nor
i
it
would
be
too
my
speech
would
have
ended
flippantly
but
for
the
grave
set
of
her
features
i
wonder
who
live
here
she
said
the
owner
is
just
dead
they
say
it
is
an
awful
house
full
of
ghosts
of
course
one
is
not
afraid
now
the
sunlight
lay
golden
and
soft
on
the
dusty
parquet
of
the
floor
but
at
night
when
the
wind
wails
and
the
doors
creak
and
the
things
rustle
oh
it
must
be
awful
i
hear
the
house
has
been
left
to
two
people
or
rather
one
is
to
have
the
house
and
the
other
a
sum
of
money
said
i
it
a
beautiful
house
full
of
beautiful
things
but
i
should
think
at
least
one
of
the
heirs
would
rather
have
the
money
oh
yes
i
should
think
so
i
wonder
whether
the
heirs
know
about
the
ghost
the
lights
can
be
seen
from
the
inn
you
know
at
twelve
and
they
see
the
ghost
in
white
at
the
window
never
the
black
one
oh
yes
i
suppose
so
the
ghosts
do
appear
together
no
i
suppose
said
i
whoever
it
is
that
manages
such
things
knows
that
the
poor
ghosts
would
like
to
be
together
so
it
wo
let
them
she
shivered
come
she
said
we
have
seen
all
over
the
house
let
us
get
back
into
the
sunshine
now
i
will
go
out
and
you
shall
bolt
the
door
after
me
and
then
you
can
come
out
by
the
window
thank
you
so
much
for
all
the
trouble
you
have
taken
it
has
really
been
quite
an
adventure
i
rather
liked
that
expression
and
she
hastened
to
spoil
it
quite
an
adventure
going
all
over
this
glorious
old
place
and
looking
at
everything
one
wanted
to
see
and
not
just
at
what
the
housekeeper
did
mind
one
looking
at
she
passed
through
the
door
but
when
i
had
closed
it
and
prepared
to
lock
it
i
found
that
the
key
was
no
longer
in
the
lock
i
looked
on
the
floor
i
felt
in
my
pockets
and
at
last
wandering
back
into
the
kitchen
discovered
it
on
the
table
where
i
swear
i
never
put
it
when
i
had
fitted
that
key
into
the
lock
and
turned
it
and
got
out
of
the
window
and
made
that
fast
i
dropped
into
the
yard
no
one
shared
its
solitude
with
me
i
searched
garden
and
pleasure
grounds
but
never
a
glimpse
of
pink
rewarded
my
anxious
eyes
i
found
the
sundial
again
and
stretched
myself
along
the
warm
brick
of
the
wide
step
where
she
had
sat
and
called
myself
a
fool
i
had
let
her
go
i
did
not
know
her
name
i
did
not
know
where
she
lived
she
had
been
at
the
inn
but
probably
only
for
lunch
i
should
never
see
her
again
and
certainly
in
that
event
i
should
never
see
again
such
dark
soft
eyes
such
hair
such
a
contour
of
cheek
and
chin
such
a
frank
smile
in
a
word
a
girl
with
whom
it
would
be
so
delightfully
natural
for
me
to
fall
in
love
for
all
the
time
she
had
been
talking
to
me
of
architecture
and
archæology
of
dates
and
periods
of
carvings
and
mouldings
i
had
been
recklessly
falling
in
love
with
the
idea
of
falling
in
love
with
her
i
had
cherished
and
adored
this
delightful
possibility
and
now
my
chance
was
over
even
i
could
not
definitely
fall
in
love
after
one
interview
with
a
girl
i
was
never
to
see
again
and
falling
in
love
is
so
pleasant
i
cursed
my
lost
chance
and
went
back
to
the
inn
i
talked
to
the
waiter
yes
a
lady
in
pink
had
lunched
there
with
a
party
had
gone
on
to
the
castle
a
party
from
tonbridge
it
was
barnhurst
castle
is
close
to
sefton
manor
the
inn
lays
itself
out
to
entertain
persons
who
come
in
brakes
and
carve
their
names
on
the
walls
of
the
castle
keep
the
inn
has
a
visitors
book
i
examined
it
some
twenty
feminine
names
any
one
might
be
hers
the
waiter
looked
over
my
shoulder
i
turned
the
pages
only
parties
staying
in
the
house
in
this
part
of
the
book
said
the
waiter
my
eye
caught
one
name
selwyn
sefton
in
a
clear
round
black
staying
here
i
pointed
to
the
name
yes
sir
came
sir
can
i
have
a
private
i
had
one
i
ordered
my
dinner
to
be
served
in
it
and
i
sat
down
and
considered
my
course
of
action
should
i
invite
my
cousin
selwyn
to
dinner
ply
him
with
wine
and
exact
promises
honour
forbade
should
i
seek
him
out
and
try
to
establish
friendly
relations
to
what
end
then
i
saw
from
my
window
a
young
man
in
a
suit
with
a
face
at
once
pallid
and
coarse
he
strolled
along
the
gravel
path
and
a
woman
voice
in
the
garden
called
selwyn
he
disappeared
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
i
do
think
i
ever
disliked
a
man
so
much
at
first
sight
brute
said
i
why
should
he
have
the
house
he
stucco
it
all
over
as
likely
as
not
perhaps
let
it
he
never
stand
the
ghosts
either
then
the
inexcusable
daring
idea
of
my
life
came
to
me
striking
me
rigid
a
blow
from
my
other
self
it
must
have
been
a
minute
or
two
before
my
muscles
relaxed
and
my
arms
fell
at
my
sides
i
do
it
i
said
i
dined
i
told
the
people
of
the
house
not
to
sit
up
for
me
i
was
going
to
see
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
and
might
stay
the
night
with
them
i
took
my
inverness
cape
with
me
on
my
arm
and
my
soft
felt
hat
in
my
pocket
i
wore
a
light
suit
and
a
straw
hat
before
i
started
i
leaned
cautiously
from
my
window
the
lamp
at
the
bow
window
next
to
mine
showed
me
the
pallid
young
man
smoking
a
fat
reeking
cigar
i
hoped
he
would
continue
to
sit
there
smoking
his
window
looked
the
right
way
and
if
he
did
see
what
i
wanted
him
to
see
some
one
else
in
the
inn
would
the
landlady
had
assured
me
that
i
should
disturb
no
one
if
i
came
in
at
twelve
we
hardly
keep
country
hours
here
sir
she
said
on
account
of
so
much
excursionist
business
i
bought
candles
in
the
village
and
as
i
went
down
across
the
park
in
the
soft
darkness
i
turned
again
and
again
to
be
sure
that
the
light
and
the
pallid
young
man
were
still
at
that
window
it
was
now
past
eleven
i
got
into
the
house
and
lighted
a
candle
and
crept
through
the
dark
kitchens
whose
windows
i
knew
did
not
look
towards
the
inn
when
i
came
to
the
hall
i
blew
out
my
candle
i
dared
not
show
light
prematurely
and
in
the
unhaunted
part
of
the
house
i
gave
myself
a
nasty
knock
against
one
of
the
long
tables
but
it
helped
me
to
get
my
bearings
and
presently
i
laid
my
hand
on
the
stone
balustrade
of
the
great
staircase
you
would
hardly
believe
me
if
i
were
to
tell
you
truly
of
my
sensations
as
i
began
to
go
up
these
stairs
i
am
not
a
coward
at
least
i
had
never
thought
so
till
then
but
the
absolute
darkness
unnerved
me
i
had
to
go
slowly
or
i
should
have
lost
my
head
and
blundered
up
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
so
strong
was
the
feeling
of
something
something
uncanny
just
behind
me
i
set
my
teeth
i
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
felt
along
the
walls
and
after
a
false
start
which
landed
me
in
the
great
picture
gallery
i
found
the
white
parlour
entered
it
closed
the
door
and
felt
my
way
to
a
little
room
without
a
window
which
we
had
decided
must
have
been
a
here
i
ventured
to
my
candle
the
white
parlour
i
remembered
was
fully
furnished
returning
to
it
i
struck
one
match
and
by
its
flash
determined
the
way
to
the
mantelpiece
then
i
closed
the
door
behind
me
i
felt
my
way
to
the
mantelpiece
and
took
down
the
two
brass
candelabra
i
placed
these
on
a
table
a
yard
or
two
from
the
window
and
in
them
set
up
my
candles
it
is
astonishingly
difficult
in
the
dark
to
do
anything
even
a
thing
so
simple
as
the
setting
up
of
a
candle
then
i
went
back
into
my
little
room
put
on
the
inverness
cape
and
the
slouch
hat
and
looked
at
my
watch
i
must
wait
i
sat
down
and
waited
i
thought
how
rich
i
was
the
thought
fell
flat
i
wanted
this
house
i
thought
of
my
beautiful
pink
lady
but
i
put
that
thought
aside
i
had
an
inward
consciousness
that
my
conduct
more
heroic
than
enough
in
one
sense
would
seem
mean
and
crafty
in
her
eyes
only
ten
minutes
had
passed
i
could
not
wait
till
twelve
the
chill
of
the
night
and
of
the
damp
unused
house
and
perhaps
some
less
material
influence
made
me
shiver
i
opened
the
door
crept
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
table
and
carefully
keeping
myself
below
the
level
of
the
window
i
reached
up
a
trembling
arm
and
lighted
one
by
one
my
forty
candles
the
room
was
a
blaze
of
light
my
courage
came
back
to
me
with
the
retreat
of
the
darkness
i
was
far
too
excited
to
know
what
a
fool
i
was
making
of
myself
i
rose
boldly
and
struck
an
attitude
over
against
the
window
where
the
shone
upon
as
well
as
behind
me
my
inverness
was
flung
jauntily
over
my
shoulder
my
soft
black
felt
twisted
and
slouched
over
my
eyes
there
i
stood
for
the
world
and
particularly
for
my
cousin
selwyn
to
see
the
very
image
of
the
ghost
that
haunted
that
chamber
and
from
my
window
i
could
see
the
light
in
that
other
window
and
indistinctly
the
lounging
figure
there
oh
my
cousin
selwyn
i
wished
many
things
to
your
address
in
that
moment
for
it
was
only
a
moment
that
i
had
to
feel
brave
and
daring
in
then
i
heard
deep
down
in
the
house
a
sound
very
slight
very
faint
then
came
silence
i
drew
a
deep
breath
the
silence
endured
and
i
stood
by
my
lighted
window
after
a
very
long
time
as
it
seemed
i
heard
a
board
crack
and
then
a
soft
rustling
sound
that
drew
near
and
seemed
to
pause
outside
the
very
door
of
my
parlour
again
i
held
my
breath
and
now
i
thought
of
the
most
horrible
story
poe
ever
wrote
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
and
i
fancied
i
saw
the
handle
of
that
door
move
i
fixed
my
eyes
on
it
the
fancy
passed
and
returned
then
again
there
was
silence
and
then
the
door
opened
with
a
soft
silent
suddenness
and
i
saw
in
the
doorway
a
figure
in
trailing
white
its
eyes
blazed
in
a
face
it
made
two
ghostly
gliding
steps
forward
and
my
heart
stood
still
i
had
not
thought
it
possible
for
a
man
to
experience
so
sharp
a
pang
of
sheer
terror
i
had
masqueraded
as
one
of
the
ghosts
in
this
accursed
house
well
the
other
ghost
the
real
one
had
come
to
meet
me
i
do
not
like
to
dwell
on
that
moment
the
only
thing
which
it
pleases
me
to
remember
is
that
i
did
not
scream
or
go
mad
i
think
i
stood
on
the
verge
of
both
the
ghost
i
say
took
two
steps
forward
then
it
threw
up
its
arms
the
lighted
taper
it
carried
fell
on
the
floor
and
it
reeled
back
against
the
door
with
its
arms
across
its
face
the
fall
of
the
candle
woke
me
as
from
a
nightmare
it
fell
solidly
and
rolled
away
under
the
table
i
perceived
that
my
ghost
was
human
i
cried
incoherently
do
for
heaven
sake
it
all
right
the
ghost
dropped
its
hands
and
turned
agonised
eyes
on
me
i
tore
off
my
cloak
and
hat
i
did
scream
she
said
and
with
that
i
sprang
forward
and
caught
her
in
my
arms
my
poor
pink
lady
white
now
as
a
white
rose
i
carried
her
into
the
and
left
one
candle
with
her
extinguishing
the
others
hastily
for
now
i
saw
what
in
my
extravagant
folly
had
escaped
me
before
that
my
ghost
exhibition
might
bring
the
whole
village
down
on
the
house
i
tore
down
the
long
corridor
and
double
locked
the
doors
leading
from
it
to
the
staircase
then
back
to
the
and
the
prone
white
rose
how
in
the
madness
of
that
night
folly
i
had
thought
to
bring
a
passes
my
understanding
but
i
had
done
it
now
i
rubbed
her
hands
with
the
spirit
i
rubbed
her
temples
i
tried
to
force
it
between
her
lips
and
at
last
she
sighed
and
opened
her
eyes
oh
thank
god
thank
god
i
cried
for
indeed
i
had
almost
feared
that
my
mad
trick
had
killed
her
are
you
better
oh
poor
little
lady
are
you
better
she
moved
her
head
a
little
on
my
arm
again
she
sighed
and
her
eyes
closed
i
gave
her
more
brandy
she
took
it
choked
raised
herself
against
my
shoulder
i
all
right
now
she
said
faintly
it
served
me
right
how
silly
it
all
is
then
she
began
to
laugh
and
then
she
began
to
cry
it
was
at
this
moment
that
we
heard
voices
on
the
terrace
below
she
clutched
at
my
arm
in
a
frenzy
of
terror
the
bright
tears
glistening
on
her
cheeks
oh
not
any
more
not
any
more
she
cried
i
ca
bear
it
hush
i
said
taking
her
hands
strongly
in
mine
i
played
the
fool
so
have
you
we
must
play
the
man
now
the
people
in
the
village
have
seen
the
lights
that
all
they
think
we
burglars
they
get
in
keep
quiet
and
they
go
away
but
when
they
did
go
away
they
left
the
local
constable
on
guard
he
kept
guard
like
a
man
till
daylight
began
to
creep
over
the
hill
and
then
he
crawled
into
the
hayloft
and
fell
asleep
small
blame
to
him
but
through
those
long
hours
i
sat
beside
her
and
held
her
hand
at
first
she
clung
to
me
as
a
frightened
child
clings
and
her
tears
were
the
prettiest
saddest
things
to
see
as
we
grew
calmer
we
talked
i
did
it
to
frighten
my
cousin
i
owned
i
meant
to
have
told
you
i
mean
yesterday
only
you
went
away
i
am
lawrence
sefton
and
the
place
is
to
go
either
to
me
or
to
my
cousin
selwyn
and
i
wanted
to
frighten
him
off
it
but
you
why
did
you
even
then
i
could
see
she
looked
at
me
i
do
know
how
i
ever
could
have
thought
i
was
brave
enough
to
do
it
but
i
did
want
the
house
so
and
i
wanted
to
frighten
you
to
frighten
why
because
i
am
your
cousin
selwyn
she
said
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
and
you
knew
me
i
asked
by
your
ring
she
said
i
saw
your
father
wear
it
when
i
was
a
little
girl
ca
we
get
back
to
the
inn
now
not
unless
you
want
every
one
to
know
how
silly
we
have
been
i
wish
you
forgive
me
she
said
when
we
had
talked
awhile
and
she
had
even
laughed
at
the
description
of
the
pallid
young
man
on
whom
i
had
bestowed
in
my
mind
her
name
the
wrong
is
mutual
i
said
we
will
exchange
forgivenesses
oh
but
it
is
she
said
eagerly
because
i
knew
it
was
you
and
you
did
know
it
was
me
you
would
have
tried
to
frighten
you
know
i
would
my
voice
was
tenderer
than
i
meant
it
to
be
she
was
silent
and
who
is
to
have
the
house
she
said
why
you
of
course
i
never
will
why
oh
because
ca
we
put
off
the
decision
i
asked
impossible
we
must
decide
i
mean
well
when
we
meet
i
mean
with
lawyers
and
chaperones
and
mothers
and
relations
give
me
one
word
alone
with
you
yes
she
answered
with
docility
do
you
know
she
said
presently
i
can
never
respect
myself
again
to
undertake
a
thing
like
that
and
then
be
so
horribly
frightened
oh
i
thought
you
really
the
other
ghost
i
will
tell
you
a
secret
said
i
i
thought
were
and
i
was
much
more
frightened
than
you
oh
well
she
said
leaning
against
my
shoulder
as
a
tired
child
might
have
done
if
you
were
frightened
too
cousin
lawrence
i
do
mind
so
very
very
much
it
was
soon
afterwards
that
cautiously
looking
out
of
the
parlour
window
for
the
twentieth
time
i
had
the
happiness
of
seeing
the
local
policeman
disappear
into
the
stable
rubbing
his
eyes
we
got
out
of
the
window
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
and
went
back
to
the
inn
across
the
dewy
park
the
french
window
of
the
which
had
let
her
out
let
us
both
in
no
one
was
stirring
so
no
one
save
she
and
i
were
any
the
wiser
as
to
that
night
work
it
was
like
a
garden
party
next
day
when
lawyers
and
executors
and
aunts
and
relations
met
on
the
terrace
in
front
of
sefton
manor
house
her
eyes
were
downcast
she
followed
her
aunt
demurely
over
the
house
and
the
grounds
your
decision
said
my
solicitor
has
to
be
given
within
the
hour
my
cousin
and
i
will
announce
it
within
that
time
i
said
and
i
at
once
gave
her
my
arm
arrived
at
the
sundial
we
stopped
this
is
my
proposal
i
said
we
will
say
that
we
decide
that
the
house
is
yours
we
will
spend
the
in
restoring
it
and
the
grounds
by
the
time
that
done
we
can
decide
who
is
to
have
it
but
how
oh
we
draw
lots
or
toss
a
halfpenny
or
anything
you
like
i
rather
decide
now
she
said
take
it
no
shall
i
rather
you
had
it
i
i
do
feel
so
greedy
as
i
did
yesterday
she
said
neither
do
i
or
at
any
rate
not
in
the
same
way
do
do
take
the
house
she
said
very
earnestly
then
i
said
my
cousin
selwyn
unless
you
take
the
house
i
shall
make
you
an
offer
of
marriage
she
breathed
and
when
you
have
declined
it
on
the
very
proper
ground
of
our
too
slight
acquaintance
i
will
take
my
turn
at
declining
i
will
decline
the
house
then
if
you
are
obdurate
it
will
become
an
asylum
do
be
obdurate
pretend
to
take
the
house
and
she
looked
at
me
rather
piteously
very
well
she
said
i
will
pretend
to
take
the
house
and
when
it
is
restored
we
spin
the
penny
so
before
the
waiting
relations
the
house
was
adjudged
to
my
cousin
selwyn
when
the
restoration
was
complete
i
met
selwyn
at
the
sundial
we
had
met
there
often
in
the
course
of
the
restoration
in
which
business
we
both
took
an
extravagant
interest
now
i
said
we
spin
the
penny
heads
you
take
the
house
tails
it
comes
to
me
i
spun
the
coin
it
fell
on
the
brick
steps
of
the
sundial
and
stuck
upright
there
wedged
between
two
bricks
she
laughed
i
laughed
it
not
house
i
said
it
not
house
said
she
dear
said
i
and
we
were
neither
of
us
laughing
then
ca
it
be
house
and
thank
god
our
house
it
is
ii
the
power
of
darkness
it
was
an
enthusiastic
half
the
students
from
her
atelier
were
there
and
twice
as
many
more
from
other
studios
she
had
been
the
belle
of
the
artists
quarter
in
montparnasse
for
three
golden
months
now
she
was
off
to
the
riviera
to
meet
her
people
and
every
one
she
knew
was
at
the
gare
de
lyons
to
catch
the
pretty
last
glimpse
of
her
and
as
had
been
more
than
once
said
late
of
an
evening
to
see
her
was
to
love
her
she
was
one
of
those
agitating
blondes
with
the
naturally
rippled
hair
the
rounded
cheeks
the
large
eyes
that
look
all
things
and
mean
heaven
alone
knows
how
little
she
held
her
court
like
a
queen
leaning
out
of
the
carriage
window
and
receiving
bouquets
books
journals
long
last
words
and
last
longing
looks
all
eyes
were
on
her
and
her
eyes
were
for
all
and
her
smile
for
all
but
one
that
is
not
a
single
glance
went
edward
way
and
edward
tall
lean
gaunt
with
big
eyes
straight
nose
and
mouth
somewhat
too
small
too
beautiful
seemed
to
grow
thinner
and
paler
before
one
eyes
one
pair
of
eyes
at
least
saw
the
miracle
worked
the
paling
of
what
had
seemed
absolute
pallor
the
revelation
of
the
bones
of
a
face
that
seemed
already
covered
but
by
the
thinnest
possible
veil
of
flesh
and
the
man
whose
eyes
saw
this
rejoiced
for
he
loved
her
like
the
rest
or
not
like
the
rest
and
he
had
had
edward
face
before
him
for
the
last
month
in
that
secret
shrine
where
we
set
the
loved
and
the
hated
the
shrine
that
is
lighted
by
a
million
lamps
kindled
at
the
soul
flame
the
shrine
that
leaps
into
dazzling
glow
when
the
candles
are
out
and
one
lies
alone
on
hot
pillows
to
outface
the
night
and
the
light
as
best
one
may
oh
all
of
you
said
rose
i
shall
miss
you
oh
you
do
know
how
i
shall
miss
you
all
she
gathered
the
glances
of
her
friends
and
her
worshippers
on
her
own
glance
as
one
gathers
jewels
on
a
silken
string
the
eyes
of
edward
alone
seemed
to
escape
her
em
voiture
messieurs
et
dames
folk
drew
back
from
the
train
there
was
a
whistle
and
then
at
the
very
last
little
moment
of
all
as
the
train
pulled
itself
together
for
the
start
her
eyes
met
edward
eyes
and
the
other
man
saw
the
meeting
and
he
knew
which
was
more
than
edward
did
so
when
the
light
of
life
having
been
borne
away
in
the
retreating
train
the
group
dispersed
the
other
man
whose
name
by
the
way
was
vincent
linked
his
arm
in
edward
and
asked
cheerily
whither
away
sweet
nymph
i
off
home
said
edward
the
to
calais
sick
of
paris
one
has
to
see
one
people
sometimes
do
you
know
hang
it
all
was
edward
way
of
expressing
the
longing
that
tore
him
for
the
old
house
among
the
brown
woods
of
kent
no
attraction
here
now
eh
the
chief
attraction
has
gone
certainly
edward
made
himself
say
but
there
are
as
good
fish
in
the
sea
fishing
is
my
trade
said
edward
the
beautiful
rose
said
vincent
edward
raised
hurriedly
the
only
shield
he
could
find
it
happened
to
be
the
truth
as
he
saw
it
oh
he
said
of
course
we
all
in
love
with
her
and
all
hopelessly
vincent
perceived
that
this
was
truth
as
edward
saw
it
what
are
you
going
to
do
till
your
train
goes
he
asked
i
do
know
café
i
suppose
and
a
vilely
early
dinner
let
look
in
at
the
musée
grévin
said
vincent
the
two
were
friends
they
had
been
and
this
is
a
link
that
survives
many
a
strain
too
strong
to
be
resisted
by
more
intimate
and
vital
bonds
and
they
were
though
that
counts
for
little
or
much
as
you
take
it
besides
vincent
knew
something
about
edward
that
no
one
else
of
their
age
and
standing
even
guessed
he
knew
that
edward
was
afraid
of
the
dark
and
why
he
had
found
it
out
that
christmas
that
the
two
had
spent
at
an
english
country
house
the
house
was
full
there
was
a
dance
there
were
to
be
theatricals
early
in
the
new
year
the
hostess
meant
to
move
house
to
an
old
convent
built
in
tudor
times
a
beautiful
place
with
terraces
and
clipped
yew
trees
castellated
battlements
a
moat
swans
and
a
ghost
story
you
boys
she
said
must
put
up
with
a
in
the
new
house
i
hope
the
ghost
wo
worry
you
she
a
nun
with
a
bunch
of
keys
and
no
eyes
comes
and
breathes
softly
on
the
back
of
your
neck
when
shaving
then
you
see
her
in
the
glass
and
as
often
as
not
you
cut
your
throat
she
laughed
so
did
edward
and
vincent
and
the
other
young
men
there
were
seven
or
eight
of
them
but
that
night
when
sparse
candles
had
lighted
the
boys
to
their
rooms
when
the
last
pipe
had
been
smoked
the
last
said
there
came
a
fumbling
with
the
handle
of
vincent
door
edward
entered
an
unwieldy
figure
clasping
pillows
trailing
blankets
what
the
deuce
queried
vincent
in
natural
amazement
i
turn
in
here
on
the
floor
if
you
do
mind
said
edward
i
know
it
beastly
rot
but
i
ca
stand
it
the
room
they
put
me
into
it
an
attic
as
big
as
a
barn
and
there
a
great
door
at
the
end
eight
feet
high
raw
oak
it
is
and
it
leads
into
a
sort
of
bare
beams
and
rafters
and
black
as
hell
i
know
i
an
abject
duffer
but
there
it
is
i
ca
face
it
vincent
was
sympathetic
though
he
had
never
known
a
that
could
not
be
exorcised
by
pipe
book
and
candle
i
know
old
chap
there
no
reasoning
about
these
things
said
he
and
so
on
you
ca
despise
me
more
than
i
despise
myself
edward
said
i
feel
a
crawling
hound
but
it
is
so
i
had
a
scare
when
i
was
a
kid
and
it
seems
to
have
left
a
sort
of
brand
on
me
i
branded
old
man
and
the
feel
of
it
not
nice
again
vincent
was
sympathetic
and
the
poor
little
tale
came
out
how
edward
eight
years
old
and
greedy
as
became
his
little
years
had
sneaked
down
to
pick
among
the
outcomings
of
a
and
how
in
the
hall
dark
with
the
light
of
an
artistic
coloured
glass
lantern
a
white
figure
had
suddenly
faced
him
leaned
towards
him
it
seemed
pointed
hands
at
his
heart
that
next
day
finding
him
weak
from
his
fainting
fit
had
shown
the
horror
to
be
but
a
statue
a
new
purchase
of
his
father
had
mattered
not
one
whit
edward
had
shared
vincent
room
and
vincent
alone
of
all
men
shared
edward
secret
and
now
in
paris
rose
speeding
away
towards
cannes
vincent
said
let
look
in
at
the
musée
grévin
the
musée
grévin
is
a
show
your
mind
at
the
word
flies
instantly
to
the
excellent
exhibition
founded
by
the
worthy
madame
tussaud
and
you
think
you
know
what
mean
but
you
are
wrong
the
exhibition
of
madame
tussaud
in
these
days
at
any
rate
is
the
work
of
for
a
class
the
musée
grévin
contains
the
work
of
artists
for
a
nation
of
artists
wax
modelled
and
retouched
till
it
seems
as
near
life
as
death
is
this
is
what
one
sees
at
the
musée
grévin
let
look
in
at
the
musée
grévin
said
vincent
he
remembered
the
pleasant
thrill
the
musée
had
given
him
and
wondered
what
sort
of
a
thrill
it
would
give
his
friend
i
hate
museums
said
edward
this
is
a
museum
vincent
said
and
truly
it
just
all
right
said
edward
indifferently
and
they
went
they
reached
the
doors
of
the
musée
in
the
dusk
of
a
february
evening
one
walks
along
a
bare
narrow
corridor
much
like
the
entrance
to
the
stalls
of
the
standard
theatre
and
such
daylight
as
there
may
be
fades
away
behind
one
and
one
finds
oneself
in
a
square
hall
heavily
decorated
and
displaying
with
its
electric
lights
loie
fuller
in
her
skirts
and
one
or
two
other
figures
not
designed
to
quicken
the
pulse
it
very
like
madame
tussaud
said
edward
yes
vincent
said
is
it
then
they
passed
through
an
arch
and
behold
a
long
room
with
waxen
groups
behind
glass
the
of
the
opéra
kitchener
at
fashoda
this
last
with
a
desert
background
lit
by
something
convincingly
like
desert
sunlight
by
jove
said
edward
that
jolly
good
yes
said
vincent
again
is
it
edward
interest
grew
the
things
were
so
convincing
so
very
nearly
alive
given
the
right
angle
their
glass
eyes
met
one
own
and
seemed
to
exchange
with
one
meaning
glances
vincent
led
the
way
to
an
arched
door
labelled
gallerie
de
la
revolution
there
one
saw
almost
in
the
living
suffering
body
poor
marie
antoinette
in
prison
in
the
temple
her
little
son
on
his
couch
of
rags
the
rats
eating
from
his
platter
the
brutal
simon
calling
to
him
from
the
grated
window
one
almost
heard
the
words
ho
la
little
capet
are
you
asleep
one
saw
marat
bleeding
in
his
bath
the
brave
charlotte
eyeing
him
the
very
tiles
of
the
the
glass
of
the
windows
with
outside
the
very
sunlight
as
it
seemed
of
on
that
yellow
july
evening
the
thirteenth
of
the
month
the
spectators
did
not
move
in
a
public
place
among
figures
they
peeped
through
open
doors
into
rooms
where
history
seemed
to
be
the
rooms
were
lighted
each
by
its
own
sun
or
lamp
or
candle
the
spectators
walked
among
shadows
that
might
have
oppressed
a
nervous
person
fine
eh
said
vincent
yes
said
edward
it
wonderful
a
turn
of
a
corner
brought
them
to
a
room
marie
antoinette
fainting
supported
by
her
ladies
poor
fat
louis
by
the
window
looking
literally
sick
what
the
matter
with
them
all
said
edward
look
at
the
window
said
vincent
there
was
a
window
to
the
room
outside
was
sunshine
the
sunshine
of
and
gleaming
in
it
blonde
hair
flowing
red
mouth
half
open
what
seemed
the
head
of
a
beautiful
woman
it
was
raised
on
a
pike
so
that
it
seemed
to
be
looking
in
at
the
window
i
say
said
edward
and
the
head
on
the
pike
seemed
to
sway
before
his
eyes
madame
de
lamballe
good
thing
is
it
said
vincent
it
altogether
too
much
of
a
good
thing
said
edward
look
here
i
had
enough
of
this
oh
you
must
just
see
the
catacombs
said
vincent
nothing
bloody
you
know
only
early
christians
being
married
and
baptized
and
all
that
he
led
the
way
down
some
clumsy
steps
to
the
cellars
which
the
genius
of
a
great
artist
has
transformed
into
the
exact
semblance
of
the
old
catacombs
at
rome
the
same
rough
hewing
of
rock
the
same
sacred
tokens
engraved
strongly
and
simply
and
among
the
arches
of
these
subterranean
burrowings
the
life
of
the
early
christians
their
sacraments
their
joys
their
sorrows
all
expressed
in
groups
of
as
like
life
as
death
is
but
this
is
very
fine
you
know
said
edward
getting
his
breath
again
after
madame
de
lamballe
and
his
imagination
loved
the
thought
of
the
noble
sufferings
and
refrainings
of
these
first
lovers
of
the
crucified
christ
yes
said
vincent
for
the
third
time
is
it
they
passed
the
baptism
and
the
burying
and
the
marriage
the
tableaux
were
sufficiently
lighted
but
little
light
strayed
to
the
narrow
passage
where
the
two
men
walked
and
the
darkness
seemed
to
press
tangible
as
a
bodily
presence
against
edward
shoulder
he
glanced
backward
come
he
said
i
had
enough
come
on
then
said
vincent
they
turned
the
corner
and
a
blaze
of
italian
sunlight
struck
at
their
eyes
with
positive
dazzlement
there
lay
the
coliseum
tier
on
tier
of
eager
faces
under
the
blue
sky
of
italy
they
were
level
with
the
arena
in
the
arena
were
crosses
from
them
drooped
bleeding
figures
on
the
sand
beasts
prowled
bodies
lay
they
saw
it
all
through
bars
they
seemed
to
be
in
the
place
where
the
chosen
victims
waited
their
turn
waited
for
the
lions
and
the
crosses
the
palm
and
the
crown
close
by
edward
was
a
group
an
old
man
a
woman
children
he
could
have
touched
them
with
his
hand
the
woman
and
the
man
stared
in
an
agony
of
terror
straight
in
the
eyes
of
a
snarling
tiger
ten
feet
long
that
stood
up
on
its
hind
feet
and
clawed
through
the
bars
at
them
the
youngest
child
only
unconscious
of
the
horror
laughed
in
the
very
face
of
it
roman
soldiers
unmoved
in
military
vigilance
guarded
the
group
of
martyrs
in
a
low
cage
to
the
left
more
wild
beasts
cringed
and
seemed
to
growl
unfed
within
the
grating
on
the
wide
circle
of
yellow
sand
lions
and
tigers
drank
the
blood
of
christians
close
against
the
bars
a
great
lion
sucked
the
chest
of
a
corpse
on
whose
face
the
horror
of
the
was
printed
plain
good
god
said
edward
vincent
took
his
arm
suddenly
and
he
started
with
what
was
almost
a
shriek
what
a
nervous
chap
you
are
said
vincent
complacently
as
they
regained
the
street
where
the
lights
were
and
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
movement
of
live
human
beings
all
that
warms
and
awakens
nerves
almost
paralysed
by
the
life
in
death
of
waxen
immobility
i
do
know
said
edward
let
have
a
vermouth
shall
we
something
uncanny
about
those
wax
things
they
like
life
but
much
more
like
death
suppose
they
moved
i
do
feel
at
all
sure
that
they
do
move
when
the
lights
are
all
out
and
there
no
one
there
he
laughed
i
suppose
you
were
never
frightened
vincent
yes
i
was
once
said
vincent
sipping
his
absinthe
three
other
men
and
i
were
taking
turns
by
twos
to
watch
a
dead
man
it
was
a
fancy
of
his
mother
our
time
was
up
and
the
other
watch
had
come
so
my
chap
the
one
who
was
watching
with
me
i
mean
went
to
fetch
them
i
did
think
i
should
mind
but
it
was
just
like
you
say
how
why
i
kept
thinking
suppose
it
should
move
it
was
so
like
life
and
if
it
did
move
of
course
it
would
have
been
because
it
alive
and
i
ought
to
have
been
glad
because
the
man
was
my
friend
but
all
the
same
if
it
had
moved
i
should
have
gone
mad
yes
said
edward
that
just
exactly
it
vincent
called
for
a
second
absinthe
but
a
dead
body
different
to
he
said
i
ca
understand
any
one
being
frightened
of
oh
ca
you
the
contempt
in
the
other
tone
stung
him
i
bet
you
would
spend
a
night
alone
in
that
place
i
bet
you
five
pounds
i
do
done
said
edward
briskly
at
least
i
would
if
you
got
five
pounds
but
i
have
i
simply
rolling
i
sold
my
dejanira
did
you
know
i
shall
win
your
money
though
anyway
but
could
do
it
old
man
i
suppose
you
never
outgrow
that
childish
scare
you
might
shut
up
about
that
said
edward
shortly
oh
it
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
some
women
are
afraid
of
mice
or
spiders
i
say
does
rose
know
you
a
coward
vincent
no
offence
old
boy
one
may
as
well
call
a
spade
a
spade
of
course
you
got
tons
of
moral
courage
and
all
that
but
you
afraid
of
the
dark
and
are
you
trying
to
quarrel
with
me
heaven
in
its
mercy
forbid
but
i
bet
would
spend
a
night
in
the
musée
grévin
and
keep
your
senses
what
the
stake
anything
you
like
make
it
that
if
i
do
you
never
speak
to
rose
again
and
more
that
you
never
speak
to
me
said
edward
knocking
down
a
chair
as
he
rose
done
said
vincent
but
you
never
do
it
keep
your
hair
on
besides
you
off
home
i
shall
be
back
in
ten
days
i
do
it
then
said
edward
and
was
off
before
the
other
could
answer
then
vincent
left
alone
sat
still
and
over
his
third
absinthe
remembered
how
before
she
had
known
edward
rose
had
smiled
on
him
more
than
on
the
others
he
had
thought
he
thought
of
her
wide
lovely
eyes
her
cheeks
the
scented
curves
of
her
hair
and
then
and
there
the
devil
entered
into
him
in
ten
days
edward
would
undoubtedly
try
to
win
his
wager
he
would
try
to
spend
the
night
in
the
musée
grévin
perhaps
something
could
be
arranged
before
that
if
one
knew
the
place
thoroughly
a
little
scare
would
serve
edward
right
for
being
the
man
to
whom
that
last
glance
of
rose
had
been
given
vincent
dined
lightly
but
with
conscientious
care
and
as
he
dined
he
thought
something
might
be
done
by
tying
a
string
to
one
of
the
figures
and
making
it
move
when
edward
was
going
through
that
impossible
night
among
the
effigies
that
are
so
like
life
so
like
death
something
that
was
not
the
devil
said
you
may
frighten
him
out
of
his
wits
and
the
devil
answered
nonsense
do
him
good
he
ought
to
be
such
a
schoolgirl
anyway
the
five
pounds
might
as
well
be
won
as
any
other
night
he
would
take
a
great
coat
sleep
sound
in
the
place
of
horrors
and
the
people
who
opened
it
in
the
morning
to
sweep
and
dust
would
bear
witness
that
he
had
passed
the
night
there
he
thought
he
might
trust
to
the
french
love
of
a
sporting
wager
to
keep
him
from
any
bother
with
the
authorities
so
he
went
in
among
the
crowd
and
looked
about
among
the
for
a
place
to
hide
in
he
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
these
lifeless
images
he
had
always
been
able
to
control
his
nervous
tremors
he
was
not
even
afraid
of
being
frightened
which
by
the
way
is
the
worst
fear
of
all
as
one
looks
at
the
room
of
the
poor
little
dauphin
one
sees
a
door
to
the
left
it
opens
out
of
the
room
on
to
blackness
there
were
few
people
in
the
gallery
vincent
watched
and
in
a
moment
when
he
was
alone
he
stepped
over
the
barrier
and
through
this
door
a
narrow
passage
ran
round
behind
the
wall
of
the
room
here
he
hid
and
when
the
gallery
was
deserted
he
looked
out
across
the
body
of
little
capet
to
the
gaolers
at
the
window
there
was
a
soldier
at
the
window
too
vincent
amused
himself
with
the
fancy
that
this
soldier
might
walk
round
the
passage
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
tap
him
on
the
shoulder
in
the
darkness
only
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
soldier
and
the
gaoler
showed
so
of
course
they
could
not
walk
even
if
they
were
something
that
was
not
presently
he
himself
went
along
the
passage
and
round
to
the
window
where
they
were
he
found
that
they
had
legs
they
were
figures
dressed
completely
in
the
costume
of
the
period
thorough
the
beggars
are
even
the
parts
that
do
show
artists
upon
my
word
said
vincent
and
went
back
to
his
doorway
thinking
of
the
hidden
carving
behind
the
capitols
of
gothic
cathedrals
but
the
idea
of
the
soldier
who
might
come
behind
him
in
the
dark
stuck
in
his
mind
though
still
a
few
visitors
strolled
through
the
gallery
the
closing
hour
was
near
he
supposed
it
would
be
quite
dark
then
and
now
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
amused
by
the
thought
of
something
that
should
creep
up
behind
him
in
the
dark
he
might
possibly
be
nervous
in
that
passage
round
which
if
could
move
the
soldier
might
have
come
by
jove
he
said
one
might
easily
frighten
oneself
by
just
fancying
things
suppose
there
were
a
back
way
from
marat
and
instead
of
the
soldier
marat
came
out
of
his
bath
with
his
wet
towels
stained
with
blood
and
dabbed
them
against
your
neck
when
next
the
gallery
was
empty
he
crept
out
not
because
he
was
nervous
he
told
himself
but
because
one
might
be
and
because
the
passage
was
draughty
and
he
meant
to
sleep
he
went
down
the
steps
into
the
catacombs
and
here
he
spoke
the
truth
to
himself
hang
it
all
he
said
i
nervous
that
fool
edward
must
have
infected
me
mesmeric
influences
or
something
chuck
it
and
go
home
said
commonsense
i
damned
if
i
do
said
vincent
there
were
a
good
many
people
in
the
catacombs
at
the
moment
live
people
he
sucked
confidence
from
their
nearness
and
went
up
and
down
looking
for
a
through
arches
he
saw
a
burial
scene
a
corpse
on
a
bier
surrounded
by
mourners
a
great
pillar
cut
off
half
the
still
lying
figure
it
was
all
still
and
unemotional
as
a
sunday
school
oleograph
he
waited
till
no
one
was
near
then
slipped
quickly
through
the
mourning
group
and
hid
behind
the
pillar
surprising
heartening
too
to
find
a
plain
rushed
chair
there
doubtless
set
for
the
resting
of
tired
officials
he
sat
down
in
it
comforted
his
hand
with
the
commonplace
lines
of
its
rungs
and
back
a
shrouded
waxen
figure
just
behind
him
to
the
left
of
his
pillar
worried
him
a
little
but
the
corpse
left
him
unmoved
as
itself
a
far
better
place
this
than
that
draughty
passage
where
the
soldier
with
legs
kept
intruding
on
the
darkness
that
is
always
behind
one
custodians
went
along
the
passages
issuing
orders
a
stillness
fell
then
suddenly
all
the
lights
went
out
that
all
right
said
vincent
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
but
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
what
sleep
was
like
he
firmly
fixed
his
thoughts
on
pleasant
things
the
sale
of
his
picture
dances
with
rose
merry
evenings
with
edward
and
the
others
but
the
thoughts
rushed
by
him
like
motes
in
sunbeams
he
could
not
hold
a
single
one
of
them
and
presently
it
seemed
that
he
had
thought
of
every
pleasant
thing
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
and
that
now
if
he
thought
at
all
he
must
think
of
the
things
one
wants
most
to
forget
and
there
would
be
time
in
this
long
night
to
think
much
of
many
things
but
now
he
found
that
he
could
no
longer
think
the
draped
effigy
just
behind
him
worried
him
again
he
had
been
trying
at
the
back
of
his
mind
behind
the
other
thoughts
to
strangle
the
thought
of
it
but
it
was
there
very
close
to
him
suppose
it
put
out
its
hand
its
wax
hand
and
touched
him
but
it
was
of
wax
it
could
not
move
no
of
course
not
but
suppose
it
he
laughed
aloud
a
short
dry
laugh
that
echoed
through
the
vaults
the
cheering
effect
of
laughter
has
been
perhaps
anyhow
he
did
not
laugh
again
the
silence
was
intense
but
it
was
a
silence
thick
with
rustlings
and
breathings
and
movements
that
his
ear
strained
to
the
uttermost
could
just
not
hear
suppose
as
edward
had
said
when
all
the
lights
were
out
these
things
did
move
a
corpse
was
a
thing
that
had
moved
given
a
certain
condition
life
what
if
there
were
a
condition
given
which
these
things
could
move
what
if
such
conditions
were
present
now
what
if
all
of
them
napoleon
from
his
death
sleep
the
beasts
from
the
amphitheatre
gore
dribbling
from
their
jaws
that
soldier
with
the
legs
all
were
drawing
near
to
him
in
this
full
silence
those
death
masks
of
robespierre
and
mirabeau
they
might
float
down
through
the
darkness
till
they
touched
his
face
that
head
of
madame
de
lamballe
on
the
pike
might
be
thrust
at
him
from
behind
the
pillar
the
silence
throbbed
with
sounds
that
could
not
quite
be
heard
you
fool
he
said
to
himself
your
dinner
has
disagreed
with
you
with
a
vengeance
do
be
an
ass
the
whole
lot
are
only
a
set
of
big
dolls
he
felt
for
his
matches
and
lighted
a
cigarette
the
gleam
of
the
match
fell
on
the
face
of
the
corpse
in
front
of
him
the
light
was
brief
and
it
seemed
somehow
impossible
to
look
by
that
light
in
every
corner
where
one
would
have
wished
to
look
the
match
burnt
his
fingers
as
it
went
out
and
there
were
only
three
more
matches
in
the
box
it
was
dark
again
and
the
image
left
on
the
darkness
was
that
of
the
corpse
in
front
of
him
he
thought
of
his
dead
friend
when
the
cigarette
was
smoked
out
he
thought
of
him
more
and
more
till
it
seemed
that
what
lay
on
the
bier
was
not
wax
his
hand
reached
forward
and
drew
back
more
than
once
but
at
last
he
made
it
touch
the
bier
and
through
the
blackness
travel
up
along
a
lean
rigid
arm
to
the
wax
face
that
lay
there
so
still
the
touch
was
not
reassuring
just
so
and
not
otherwise
had
his
dead
friend
face
felt
to
the
last
touch
of
his
lips
cold
firm
waxen
people
always
said
the
dead
were
waxen
how
true
that
was
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
he
thought
of
it
now
he
sat
still
so
still
that
every
muscle
ached
because
if
you
wish
to
hear
the
sounds
that
infest
silence
you
must
be
very
still
indeed
he
thought
of
edward
and
of
the
string
he
had
meant
to
tie
to
one
of
the
figures
that
would
be
needed
he
told
himself
and
his
ears
ached
with
listening
listening
for
the
sound
that
it
seemed
break
at
last
from
that
crowded
silence
he
never
knew
how
long
he
sat
there
to
move
to
go
up
to
batter
at
the
door
and
clamour
to
be
let
out
that
one
could
have
done
if
one
had
had
a
lantern
or
even
a
full
matchbox
but
in
the
dark
not
knowing
the
turnings
to
feel
one
way
among
these
things
that
were
so
like
life
and
yet
were
not
alive
to
touch
perhaps
these
faces
that
were
not
dead
and
yet
felt
like
death
his
heart
beat
heavily
in
his
throat
at
the
thought
no
he
must
sit
still
till
morning
he
had
been
hypnotised
into
this
state
he
told
himself
by
edward
no
doubt
it
was
not
natural
to
him
then
suddenly
the
silence
was
shattered
in
the
dark
something
moved
and
after
those
sounds
that
the
silence
teemed
with
the
noise
seemed
to
him
yet
it
was
only
a
very
very
little
sound
just
the
rustling
of
drapery
as
though
something
had
turned
in
its
sleep
and
there
was
a
sigh
not
far
off
vincent
muscles
and
tendons
tightened
like
wire
he
listened
there
was
nothing
more
only
the
silence
the
thick
silence
the
sound
had
seemed
to
come
from
a
part
of
the
vault
where
long
ago
when
there
was
light
he
had
seen
a
grave
being
dug
for
the
body
of
a
young
girl
martyr
i
will
get
up
and
go
out
said
vincent
i
have
three
matches
i
am
off
my
head
i
shall
really
be
nervous
presently
if
i
do
look
out
he
got
up
and
struck
a
match
refused
his
eyes
the
sight
of
the
corpse
whose
waxen
face
he
had
felt
in
the
blackness
and
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
of
figures
by
the
match
flicker
they
seemed
to
make
way
for
him
to
turn
their
heads
to
look
after
him
the
match
lasted
till
he
got
to
a
turn
of
the
passage
his
next
match
showed
him
the
burial
scene
the
little
thin
body
of
the
martyr
palm
in
hand
lying
on
the
rock
floor
in
patient
waiting
the
the
mourners
some
standing
some
kneeling
one
crouched
on
the
ground
this
was
where
that
sound
had
come
from
that
rustle
that
sigh
he
had
thought
he
was
going
away
from
it
instead
he
had
come
straight
to
the
spot
where
if
anywhere
his
nerves
might
be
expected
to
play
him
false
bah
he
said
and
he
said
it
aloud
the
silly
things
are
only
wax
who
afraid
his
voice
sounded
loud
in
the
silence
that
lives
with
the
wax
people
they
only
wax
he
said
again
and
touched
with
his
foot
contemptuously
the
crouching
figure
in
the
mantle
and
as
he
touched
it
it
raised
its
head
and
looked
vacantly
at
him
and
its
eyes
were
mobile
and
alive
he
staggered
back
against
another
figure
and
dropped
the
match
in
the
new
darkness
he
heard
the
crouching
figure
move
towards
him
then
the
darkness
fitted
in
round
him
very
closely
what
was
it
exactly
that
sent
poor
vincent
mad
you
never
told
me
rose
asked
the
question
she
and
edward
were
looking
out
over
the
pines
and
tamarisks
across
the
blue
mediterranean
they
were
very
happy
because
it
was
their
honeymoon
he
told
her
about
the
musée
grévin
and
the
wager
but
he
did
not
state
the
terms
of
it
but
why
did
he
think
you
would
be
afraid
he
told
her
why
and
then
what
happened
why
i
suppose
he
thought
there
was
no
time
like
the
present
for
his
five
pounds
you
know
and
he
hid
among
the
and
i
missed
my
train
and
thought
there
was
no
time
like
the
present
in
fact
dear
i
thought
if
i
waited
i
should
have
time
to
make
certain
of
funking
it
so
i
hid
there
too
and
i
put
on
my
big
black
capuchon
and
sat
down
right
in
one
of
the
groups
they
could
see
me
from
the
passage
where
you
walk
and
after
they
put
the
lights
out
i
simply
went
to
sleep
and
i
woke
up
and
there
was
a
light
and
i
heard
some
one
say
only
wax
and
it
was
vincent
he
thought
i
was
one
of
the
wax
people
till
i
looked
at
him
and
i
expect
he
thought
i
was
one
of
them
even
then
poor
chap
and
his
match
went
out
and
while
i
was
trying
to
find
my
railway
that
i
got
near
me
he
began
to
scream
and
the
night
watchman
came
running
and
now
he
thinks
every
one
in
the
asylum
is
made
of
wax
and
he
screams
if
they
come
near
him
they
have
to
put
his
food
beside
him
while
he
asleep
it
horrible
i
ca
help
feeling
as
if
it
were
my
fault
somehow
of
course
it
not
said
rose
poor
vincent
do
you
know
i
never
liked
him
there
was
a
pause
then
she
said
but
how
was
it
were
frightened
i
was
he
said
horribly
frightened
i
i
it
sounds
idiotic
but
i
thought
i
should
go
mad
at
first
i
did
really
and
yet
i
to
go
through
with
it
and
then
i
got
among
the
figures
of
the
people
in
the
catacombs
the
people
who
died
for
for
things
do
you
know
died
in
such
horrible
ways
and
there
they
were
so
calm
and
believing
it
was
all
all
right
and
i
thought
about
what
they
gone
through
it
sounds
awful
rot
i
know
dear
but
i
expect
i
was
sleepy
those
wax
people
they
sort
of
seemed
as
if
they
were
alive
and
were
telling
me
there
was
anything
to
be
frightened
about
i
felt
as
if
i
were
one
of
them
and
they
were
all
my
friends
and
they
wake
me
if
anything
went
wrong
so
i
just
went
to
sleep
i
think
i
understand
she
said
but
she
did
and
the
odd
thing
is
he
went
on
i
never
been
afraid
of
the
dark
since
perhaps
his
calling
me
a
coward
had
something
to
do
with
it
i
do
think
so
said
she
and
she
was
right
but
she
would
never
have
understood
how
nor
why
iii
the
stranger
who
might
have
been
observed
there
he
goes
is
he
simply
detestable
she
spoke
suddenly
after
a
silence
longer
than
was
usual
to
her
she
was
tired
and
her
voice
was
a
note
or
two
above
its
habitual
key
she
blushed
a
deep
pink
blush
of
intense
annoyance
as
the
young
man
passed
down
the
long
platform
among
the
crowd
of
city
men
and
typewriting
girls
patiently
waiting
for
the
belated
train
to
allow
them
to
go
home
from
work
oh
do
you
think
he
heard
oh
molly
i
believe
he
did
nonsense
said
molly
briskly
of
course
he
did
and
i
must
say
i
do
think
he
so
bad
if
he
did
look
so
sulky
he
would
be
bad
really
if
his
eyebrows
were
tied
up
into
knots
i
believe
he
look
quite
too
frightfully
sweet
for
anything
he
exactly
like
that
polish
model
we
had
last
week
oh
molly
coming
back
again
again
he
passed
the
two
girls
his
expression
was
certainly
not
amiable
how
long
have
you
known
him
molly
asked
i
know
him
i
tell
you
i
only
see
him
on
the
platform
at
mill
vale
he
and
i
seem
to
be
the
only
people
the
only
decent
people
who
found
out
the
new
station
he
goes
up
by
the
every
day
and
so
do
i
and
the
train
always
late
so
we
have
the
platform
and
the
booking
office
to
ourselves
and
there
we
sit
or
stand
or
walk
morning
after
morning
like
two
stuck
pigs
in
a
trough
of
silence
do
jumble
your
metaphors
though
you
very
nearly
carried
it
off
with
the
trough
i
own
stuck
pigs
do
walk
in
troughs
or
anywhere
else
well
you
know
what
i
mean
but
what
do
you
want
the
wretched
man
to
do
he
ca
speak
to
you
it
would
be
proper
proper
why
not
we
human
beings
not
wild
beasts
at
least
i
a
human
being
and
he
a
beast
i
see
i
wish
i
were
a
man
said
nina
there
he
is
again
his
nose
goes
up
another
half
inch
every
time
he
passes
me
what
he
got
to
be
so
superior
about
if
i
were
a
man
i
certainly
pass
the
time
of
day
with
a
if
i
were
condemned
to
spend
from
ten
to
forty
minutes
with
it
six
days
out
of
the
seven
i
expect
he
afraid
you
want
to
marry
him
my
brother
cecil
says
men
are
always
horribly
frightened
about
that
your
brother
cecil
said
nina
scornfully
yes
that
just
the
sort
of
thing
anybody
brother
cecil
say
he
simply
looks
down
on
me
because
i
go
third
he
only
goes
second
himself
too
here
the
train
the
two
art
students
climbed
into
their
carriage
and
their
talk
leaving
nina
washed
like
a
babbling
brook
about
the
feet
of
great
rocks
busied
itself
with
the
old
italian
masters
painting
as
a
mission
and
the
aims
of
art
presently
running
through
flatter
country
and
lapping
round
perspective
foreshortening
tones
values
high
lights
and
the
preposterous
lisp
of
the
anatomy
lecturer
arrived
at
mill
vale
the
slade
students
jumped
from
their
carriage
to
meet
a
wind
that
swept
grey
curtains
of
rain
across
the
bleak
length
of
the
platform
and
we
have
so
much
as
a
rib
of
an
umbrella
between
us
sighed
molly
putting
her
white
handkerchief
over
the
best
hat
which
signalised
her
saturday
to
monday
with
her
friend
you
right
that
man
is
a
pig
there
he
goes
with
an
umbrella
big
enough
for
all
three
of
us
oh
it
too
bad
he
putting
it
down
he
running
he
runs
rather
well
he
exactly
like
the
cast
of
the
discobolus
in
the
antique
room
only
his
manners
have
not
that
repose
that
stamps
the
cast
come
on
do
stand
staring
after
him
like
that
we
better
run
too
he
think
we
running
after
him
oh
bother
a
moment
of
indecision
and
nina
had
turned
her
skirt
over
her
head
and
the
two
ran
home
to
the
little
rooms
where
nina
lived
in
the
house
of
an
old
servant
nina
had
no
world
of
relations
she
was
alone
in
the
world
of
art
she
had
many
friends
and
in
the
world
of
art
she
meant
to
make
her
mark
for
the
present
she
was
content
to
make
the
tea
and
then
to
set
feet
on
the
fender
for
a
cosy
evening
did
you
see
him
coming
out
of
church
nina
asked
next
day
he
looked
sulkier
than
ever
i
ca
think
why
you
bother
about
him
said
the
other
girl
he
not
really
interesting
what
do
you
call
him
nothing
why
everything
has
a
name
even
a
pudding
made
a
name
for
him
at
once
it
is
stranger
who
might
have
been
observed
they
laughed
after
the
early
dinner
they
went
for
a
walk
none
of
your
strolls
but
a
good
steady
eight
miles
coming
home
they
met
the
stranger
and
then
they
talked
about
him
again
for
fair
reader
i
can
not
conceal
from
you
that
there
are
many
girls
who
do
think
and
talk
about
young
men
even
when
they
have
not
been
introduced
to
them
not
really
nice
girls
like
yourself
fair
reader
but
ordinary
commonplace
girls
who
have
not
your
delicate
natures
and
who
really
do
sometimes
experience
a
fleeting
sensation
of
interest
even
in
the
people
whose
names
they
do
know
next
morning
they
saw
him
at
the
station
the
took
the
bit
in
its
teeth
and
instead
of
being
as
usual
the
something
became
merely
the
so
for
some
twenty
odd
minutes
the
stranger
not
only
might
have
been
but
was
observed
by
four
bright
and
critical
eyes
i
mean
that
my
girls
stared
of
course
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
there
are
ways
of
observing
strangers
other
than
by
the
stare
direct
he
looked
sulkier
than
ever
but
he
also
had
eyes
yet
he
too
was
far
from
staring
so
far
that
the
indignant
nina
broke
out
in
a
distracted
whisper
there
you
see
i
not
important
enough
for
him
even
to
perceive
my
existence
i
always
expecting
him
to
walk
on
me
i
wonder
whether
he
apologise
when
he
found
i
was
the
station
the
stranger
shrugged
his
shoulders
all
to
himself
in
his
carriage
when
the
train
had
started
detestable
but
how
one
talks
prose
without
knowing
it
all
along
the
line
how
can
i
ever
have
come
enough
into
her
line
of
vision
to
be
distinguished
by
an
epithet
and
why
this
one
detestable
the
epithet
however
distinguishing
seemed
somehow
to
lack
charm
at
cannon
street
station
the
stranger
looked
sulkier
than
nina
had
ever
seen
him
she
said
so
adding
than
i
ever
seen
him
oh
wandering
he
looks
sulkier
than
i
ever
seen
any
one
sulkier
than
i
ever
dreamed
possible
pig
through
the
week
painting
at
the
school
and
black
and
white
work
in
the
evenings
filled
nina
mind
to
the
exclusion
even
of
strangers
who
might
in
more
leisured
moments
seem
worthy
of
observation
she
was
aware
of
the
sulky
one
on
platforms
of
course
but
talking
about
him
to
molly
was
more
amusing
somehow
than
merely
thinking
of
him
when
it
came
to
thinking
the
real
the
earnest
things
of
life
the
sketch
club
the
chance
of
the
melville
nettleship
prize
the
intricate
hideousness
of
bones
and
muscles
took
the
field
and
kept
it
against
strangers
and
acquaintances
alike
saturday
turning
this
week
scribbled
page
to
the
fair
clear
page
of
next
week
brought
the
stranger
back
to
her
thoughts
and
to
eyes
now
not
obscured
by
close
realities
he
passed
her
on
the
platform
with
a
dozen
bunches
of
violets
in
his
hands
outside
on
the
railway
bridge
the
red
and
green
lamps
glowed
dully
through
deep
floods
of
yellow
fog
the
platform
was
crowded
the
train
late
when
at
last
it
steamed
slowly
in
the
crowd
surged
towards
it
the
carriages
were
filled
in
the
moment
nina
hurried
along
the
platform
peering
into
the
carriages
full
also
then
the
guard
opened
the
way
for
her
into
the
paradise
of
a
carriage
and
just
as
the
train
gave
the
shudder
of
disgust
which
heralds
its
reluctant
departure
the
door
opened
again
and
the
guard
pushed
in
another
traveller
the
stranger
who
might
of
course
the
door
banged
the
train
moved
off
with
an
air
of
brisk
determination
a
hundred
yards
from
the
platform
it
stopped
dead
there
were
no
other
travellers
in
that
carriage
when
the
train
had
stood
still
for
ten
minutes
or
so
the
stranger
got
up
and
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
at
that
instant
the
train
decided
to
move
again
it
did
it
suddenly
and
exhausted
by
the
effort
stopped
after
half
a
dozen
yards
progress
with
so
powerful
a
turn
of
the
brake
that
the
stranger
was
flung
sideways
against
nina
and
his
elbow
nearly
knocked
her
hat
off
he
raised
his
own
apologetically
but
he
did
not
speak
even
then
the
wretch
said
nina
hotly
he
might
at
least
have
begged
my
pardon
the
stranger
sat
down
again
and
began
to
read
the
nina
had
no
papers
the
train
moved
on
an
inch
or
two
and
the
reddening
yellow
of
the
fog
seemed
like
a
charity
blanket
pressed
against
each
window
three
of
the
bunches
of
violets
shook
and
vibrated
and
slipped
the
train
moved
again
and
they
fell
on
the
floor
of
the
carriage
nina
watched
their
trembling
in
an
agony
of
irritation
induced
by
the
fog
the
delay
and
the
persistent
silence
of
her
companion
when
the
flowers
fell
she
spoke
you
dropped
your
flowers
she
said
again
a
bow
a
silent
bow
and
the
flowers
were
picked
up
oh
i
desperate
nina
said
inwardly
he
must
be
mad
or
dumb
or
have
a
vow
of
silence
i
wonder
which
the
train
had
not
yet
reached
the
next
station
though
it
had
left
the
last
nearly
an
hour
before
which
is
it
mad
dumb
or
a
monk
i
find
out
well
it
his
own
fault
he
should
be
so
aggravating
i
going
to
speak
to
him
i
made
up
my
mind
in
the
interval
between
decision
and
action
the
train
in
a
sudden
brief
access
of
nervous
energy
got
itself
through
a
station
and
paused
a
furlong
down
the
line
exhausted
by
the
effort
the
stranger
had
put
down
his
and
was
gazing
gloomily
out
at
the
fog
nina
drew
a
deep
breath
and
said
at
least
she
nearly
said
what
a
dreadful
fog
but
she
stopped
that
seemed
a
dull
beginning
if
she
said
that
he
would
think
she
was
commonplace
and
she
had
that
sustaining
inward
consciousness
mercifully
vouchsafed
even
to
the
dullest
of
us
of
being
really
rather
nice
and
not
commonplace
at
all
but
what
should
she
say
if
she
said
anything
about
the
colour
of
the
fog
and
turner
or
whistler
it
might
be
telling
but
it
would
be
of
the
shop
shoppy
if
she
began
about
books
the
suggested
this
she
would
stand
as
a
prig
confessed
if
she
spoke
of
politics
she
would
be
an
ignorant
impostor
soon
exposed
if
but
nina
took
out
her
watch
and
resolved
when
the
little
hand
gets
to
the
quarter
i
speak
whatever
i
say
say
something
and
when
the
big
hand
did
get
to
the
quarter
nina
did
speak
why
should
we
talk
she
said
he
looked
at
her
and
he
seemed
to
be
struggling
silently
with
some
emotion
too
deep
for
words
it
so
silly
to
sit
here
like
mutes
nina
went
on
hurriedly
a
little
frightened
now
she
had
begun
but
more
than
a
little
determined
not
to
be
frightened
if
we
were
at
a
dance
we
should
know
any
more
of
each
other
than
we
do
now
and
you
have
to
talk
then
why
should
we
now
then
the
stranger
spoke
and
at
the
first
sentence
nina
understood
exactly
what
reason
had
decided
the
stranger
that
they
should
not
talk
yet
now
they
did
if
this
were
a
work
of
fiction
i
should
dare
to
pretend
that
the
train
took
more
than
two
hours
to
get
to
mill
vale
but
in
a
plain
record
of
fact
one
must
speak
the
truth
the
train
took
exactly
two
hours
and
fifty
minutes
to
cover
the
eleven
miles
between
london
and
mill
vale
after
that
first
question
and
reply
nina
and
the
stranger
talked
the
whole
way
he
walked
with
her
to
the
door
of
her
lodging
and
she
offered
him
her
hand
without
that
moment
of
hesitation
which
would
have
been
natural
to
any
heroine
because
she
had
debated
the
question
of
that
handshake
all
the
way
from
the
station
and
made
up
her
mind
just
as
they
reached
the
church
a
stone
throw
from
her
home
when
the
door
closed
on
her
he
went
slowly
back
to
the
churchyard
to
lay
his
violets
on
a
grave
nina
saw
them
there
next
day
when
she
came
out
of
church
she
saw
him
too
and
gave
him
a
bow
and
a
very
small
smile
and
turned
away
quickly
the
bow
meant
you
see
i
not
going
to
speak
to
you
you
must
think
i
want
to
be
always
talking
to
you
the
smile
meant
but
you
think
i
cross
i
not
only
in
the
hot
stuffy
at
the
slade
next
day
molly
teased
with
an
arm
hopelessly
ill
drawn
and
chattered
softly
to
nina
who
in
the
saturday
solitude
had
drawn
her
easel
behind
her
friend
donkey
it
all
very
well
here
when
you
first
come
in
but
when
once
you
warm
oh
dear
how
warm
you
are
why
do
models
want
such
boiling
rooms
why
ca
they
be
soaked
in
alum
or
myrrh
or
something
to
harden
their
silly
skins
so
that
they
wo
mind
a
breath
of
decent
air
and
i
believe
the
model
deformed
she
certainly
is
from
where
i
am
oh
look
at
my
arm
i
ask
you
a
little
look
at
the
beastly
thing
foreshortened
like
this
it
looks
like
a
fillet
of
veal
with
a
pound
of
sausages
tied
on
to
it
for
a
hand
oh
my
own
and
only
nina
save
the
sinking
ship
it
ought
to
go
more
like
nina
said
with
indicative
brush
and
do
keep
on
rubbing
out
so
fiercely
you
get
paralysed
with
bread
it
a
disease
you
know
i
heard
tonks
telling
you
so
only
the
other
day
it
rather
a
good
phrase
i
wonder
where
he
got
it
he
was
rather
nice
that
day
said
molly
oh
this
arm
it
no
good
i
believe
the
model
moved
i
tell
you
i
more
bread
nina
in
her
canvas
yours
is
coming
well
what
the
matter
with
you
very
mousy
has
the
who
might
been
scowling
more
than
usual
or
have
you
got
a
headache
i
sure
this
atmosphere
enough
to
make
you
did
you
see
him
this
morning
have
you
fainted
at
his
feet
yet
has
he
relented
in
the
matter
of
umbrellas
i
sure
he
ca
have
passed
the
whole
week
without
some
act
of
grumpiness
nina
leaned
back
and
looked
through
eyes
at
the
beautiful
form
and
stupid
face
i
went
down
in
the
same
carriage
with
him
on
thursday
she
said
slowly
you
did
did
he
rush
into
the
third
class
where
angels
like
himself
ought
to
fear
to
tread
there
was
a
fog
thirds
all
full
and
seconds
too
the
guard
bundled
us
both
in
and
the
train
started
and
it
took
three
or
four
hours
to
get
down
any
one
else
in
the
carriage
not
so
much
as
a
mouse
what
you
do
do
what
could
i
do
we
sat
in
opposite
corners
as
far
as
we
could
get
from
each
other
exchanging
occasional
glances
of
mutual
detestation
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
he
knocked
me
down
and
walked
on
me
once
and
took
his
hat
off
very
politely
and
but
he
never
said
a
word
he
did
even
say
he
thought
i
was
the
and
then
some
cabbages
of
his
fell
off
the
seat
sure
they
were
thistles
vegetables
of
some
sort
and
i
said
dropped
your
whatever
they
were
and
he
just
bowed
again
in
a
sort
of
way
do
leave
that
bread
alone
molly
lost
in
the
interest
of
the
recital
was
crumbling
the
bread
as
though
the
floor
of
the
were
the
natural
haunt
of
doves
and
sparrows
well
she
said
well
said
nina
why
ever
did
you
ask
him
to
put
the
window
up
or
down
or
something
i
would
have
just
to
hear
if
he
has
a
voice
it
would
have
been
any
good
he
just
have
bowed
again
and
i
had
enough
bows
to
last
a
long
time
no
i
just
said
straight
out
that
we
were
a
couple
of
idiots
to
sit
there
gaping
at
each
other
with
our
tongues
out
and
why
on
earth
should
we
talk
you
never
did
or
words
to
that
effect
anyhow
and
then
he
said
a
long
pause
what
he
told
me
why
he
never
spoke
to
strangers
what
a
slap
in
the
face
you
poor
oh
he
did
say
it
like
you
silly
idiot
and
it
was
quite
a
good
reason
what
was
it
no
answer
tell
me
exactly
what
he
said
he
said
i
i
at
any
rate
i
satisfied
and
i
rather
wish
we
had
called
him
pigs
and
beasts
and
things
like
that
well
that
all
are
you
going
to
tell
me
the
reason
oh
very
well
you
leave
it
to
my
guessing
of
course
it
quite
evident
he
hopelessly
in
love
with
you
and
never
ventured
to
speak
for
fear
of
betraying
his
passion
but
encouraged
by
your
advances
molly
go
on
with
that
arm
and
do
be
a
vulgar
little
donkey
molly
obeyed
presently
she
said
i
not
said
nina
but
i
want
to
work
and
i
like
you
best
when
you
not
vulgar
you
very
rude
no
only
candid
molly
wounded
pride
besieged
by
her
curiosity
held
out
for
five
minutes
then
did
you
talk
to
him
much
heaps
all
the
way
down
no
answer
is
he
nice
silence
is
he
clever
i
want
to
work
well
what
i
want
to
know
is
and
then
i
let
you
alone
what
did
you
talk
about
tell
me
that
and
i
wo
ask
another
question
we
talked
said
nina
deliberately
taking
a
clean
brush
we
talked
about
your
brother
cecil
no
i
sha
tell
you
what
we
said
or
why
we
talked
about
him
or
anything
you
had
your
one
question
now
shut
up
nina
said
molly
calmly
if
i
did
like
you
so
much
i
should
hate
you
that
certainty
about
the
other
has
always
been
the
foundation
of
our
mutual
regard
said
nina
calmly
then
they
laughed
and
began
to
work
in
earnest
the
next
time
molly
mentioned
the
stranger
who
might
have
been
observed
nina
laughed
and
said
the
subject
is
forbidden
it
makes
you
vulgar
and
you
disagreeable
then
it
best
to
avoid
it
best
for
you
and
best
for
me
but
do
you
ever
see
him
now
on
occasion
he
still
travels
by
the
and
i
still
have
the
use
of
my
eyes
does
he
ever
talk
to
you
like
he
did
that
thursday
no
never
and
i
not
going
to
talk
about
him
to
you
so
it
no
good
your
turn
to
choose
a
subject
you
wo
then
it
becomes
my
turn
what
a
long
winter
this
is
we
seem
to
have
taken
years
to
get
from
november
to
february
the
time
went
more
quickly
between
february
and
may
it
was
when
the
country
was
wearing
its
full
dress
of
green
and
the
hawthorn
pearls
were
opening
into
in
the
hedgerows
that
it
was
nina
fortune
to
be
put
by
the
zealous
indiscretion
of
a
mistaken
porter
into
an
express
train
for
beechwood
the
wrong
station
the
wrong
line
the
stranger
who
might
have
been
observed
on
this
occasion
was
not
observed
but
observer
he
saw
and
recognised
the
porter
error
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
leaped
into
a
carriage
just
behind
hers
so
that
when
after
a
swift
journey
made
eventful
by
agonised
recognition
of
the
fleeting
faces
of
various
stations
where
she
might
have
changed
and
caught
her
own
train
nina
reached
beechwood
the
stranger
hand
was
ready
to
open
the
door
for
her
there
no
train
for
ages
he
said
in
tones
deliberate
almost
hesitating
shall
we
walk
home
it
only
six
miles
but
you
are
you
going
somewhere
here
no
i
i
i
saw
the
porter
put
you
in
and
i
thought
at
least
anyway
you
will
walk
wo
you
they
walked
when
they
reached
beechwood
common
he
said
wo
you
take
my
arm
and
she
took
it
her
hands
were
ungloved
the
other
hand
was
full
of
silver
may
and
bluebells
the
sun
shot
level
shafts
of
gold
between
the
birch
trees
across
the
furze
and
heather
how
beautiful
it
is
she
said
we
known
each
other
three
months
said
he
but
i
seen
you
every
day
and
we
talked
for
hours
and
hours
in
those
everlasting
trains
she
said
as
if
in
excuse
i
seen
you
every
day
for
longer
than
that
the
first
time
was
on
the
of
october
fancy
remembering
that
i
have
a
good
memory
a
silence
nina
broke
it
to
say
again
how
pretty
she
knew
she
had
said
it
before
or
something
like
it
but
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
she
wanted
to
say
something
he
put
his
hand
over
hers
as
it
lay
on
his
arm
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
well
he
said
stopping
to
look
down
into
her
eyes
and
tightening
his
clasp
on
her
hand
are
you
sorry
you
came
to
beechwood
no
then
be
glad
my
dear
i
wish
you
could
ever
be
as
glad
as
i
am
then
they
walked
on
still
with
his
hand
on
hers
nina
and
molly
sat
on
a
locker
swinging
their
feet
and
eating
their
lunch
in
the
slade
corridor
next
day
nina
was
humming
softly
under
her
breath
what
are
you
so
happy
for
all
of
a
sudden
molly
asked
your
things
are
the
worst
i
ever
seen
and
the
professor
was
down
on
you
like
a
hundred
of
bricks
this
morning
i
not
happy
said
nina
turning
away
what
seemed
to
molly
a
new
face
what
is
it
then
nothing
oh
yes
by
the
way
i
going
to
be
married
not
check
this
unflattering
display
of
incredulity
i
am
really
and
truly
and
you
never
told
me
a
thing
i
hate
slyness
and
secretiveness
nina
who
is
it
do
i
know
him
nina
named
a
name
never
even
heard
of
him
but
where
did
you
meet
him
it
really
is
rather
deceitful
of
you
i
always
meant
to
tell
you
only
there
was
nothing
to
tell
till
yesterday
except
except
everything
said
molly
well
tell
me
now
nina
jumped
up
and
shook
the
crumbs
off
her
green
muslin
pinafore
promise
not
to
be
horrid
and
i
will
i
wo
i
promise
i
wo
then
it
it
him
the
who
might
you
know
and
i
really
should
have
told
you
though
there
was
anything
to
tell
only
laugh
i
not
ca
you
see
i
not
only
what
well
when
i
spoke
to
him
that
day
in
the
train
i
said
we
talk
and
he
said
i
i
be
be
be
because
i
stammer
so
and
he
you
never
heard
anything
like
it
it
was
awful
he
took
hours
to
get
out
those
few
words
and
i
did
know
where
to
look
and
i
felt
such
a
brute
because
of
the
things
we
said
about
him
that
i
had
no
sense
left
and
i
told
him
straight
out
how
i
wondered
he
never
even
said
he
wondered
how
late
the
train
was
when
we
were
waiting
for
the
and
i
was
glad
it
was
stammering
and
not
disagreeableness
and
then
i
said
i
was
glad
he
stammered
but
so
sorry
and
he
was
awfully
nice
about
it
and
i
told
him
about
that
man
who
cured
your
brother
cecil
of
stammering
and
he
went
to
him
at
once
and
he
almost
all
right
now
good
gracious
said
molly
are
you
sure
but
why
did
he
get
cured
long
ago
he
had
a
mother
she
stammered
frightfully
after
the
shock
of
his
father
death
or
something
and
he
got
into
the
way
of
it
from
her
and
anyway
he
did
i
think
it
was
so
as
not
to
hurt
his
feelings
or
something
i
do
quite
understand
and
he
said
it
seem
to
matter
when
she
was
dead
and
he
an
artist
he
sells
his
pictures
too
and
he
teaches
he
has
a
studio
in
chelsea
it
all
sounds
a
little
thin
but
if
you
pleased
i
sure
i
am
i
am
said
nina
but
what
did
he
say
when
he
asked
you
he
did
ask
me
said
nina
but
surely
he
said
he
loved
you
since
the
first
moment
he
saw
you
nina
had
to
admit
it
then
you
see
i
was
such
a
vulgar
little
donkey
after
all
yes
you
were
you
had
any
business
even
to
such
things
much
less
say
them
why
even
did
dare
to
think
it
for
oh
for
ever
so
long
but
i
forgive
it
and
if
it
good
it
shall
be
a
pretty
little
bridesmaid
it
shall
when
is
it
to
be
asked
molly
still
adrift
in
a
sea
of
wonder
oh
quite
soon
he
says
he
says
we
only
wasting
time
by
waiting
you
see
we
both
alone
but
molly
looking
wistfully
at
her
friend
transfigured
face
perceived
sadly
that
it
was
she
who
was
alone
not
they
and
the
thought
of
the
pierrot
with
whom
she
had
danced
nine
times
at
the
students
fancy
dress
dance
an
indiscretion
hitherto
her
dearest
memory
now
offered
no
solid
consolation
nina
went
away
singing
softly
under
her
breath
molly
sighed
and
followed
slowly
iv
rack
and
thumbscrew
her
eyelids
were
red
and
swollen
her
brown
hair
flattened
out
of
its
pretty
curves
clung
closely
to
her
head
ink
stained
her
hands
and
there
was
even
a
bluish
smear
of
it
on
her
wrist
a
tray
with
stood
among
the
litter
of
manuscript
on
her
table
the
had
only
cold
in
it
the
bread
and
butter
was
untouched
she
put
down
the
pen
and
went
to
the
window
the
of
the
sunset
was
reflected
on
the
bank
of
mist
and
smoke
beyond
the
river
above
where
the
sky
was
pale
and
clear
a
star
or
two
twinkled
contentedly
she
stamped
her
foot
already
the
beautiful
garments
of
the
evening
mist
with
veiled
lights
in
the
folds
of
it
was
embroidered
sparsely
with
the
early
litten
lamps
of
impatient
workers
and
as
she
gazed
the
embroidery
was
enriched
by
more
and
more
yellow
and
white
and
orange
the
string
of
jewels
along
the
embankment
the
face
of
the
church
clock
she
turned
from
the
window
to
the
room
and
lighted
her
own
lamp
for
the
room
was
now
deeply
dusk
it
was
a
large
low
pleasant
room
it
had
always
seemed
pleasant
to
her
through
the
five
years
in
which
she
had
worked
and
played
and
laughed
and
cried
there
now
she
wondered
why
she
had
not
always
hated
it
the
stairs
creaked
the
knocker
spoke
she
caught
her
head
in
both
hands
my
god
she
said
this
is
too
much
yet
she
went
to
the
door
oh
it
only
you
she
said
and
with
no
other
greeting
walked
back
into
the
room
and
sat
down
at
the
table
the
newcomer
was
left
to
close
the
outer
door
and
to
follow
at
her
own
pleasure
the
newcomer
was
another
girl
younger
prettier
smarter
she
turned
her
head
sidewise
like
a
little
bird
and
looked
at
her
friend
with
very
bright
eyes
then
she
looked
round
the
room
my
dear
jane
she
said
whatever
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
nothing
said
her
dear
jane
very
sulkily
oh
if
genius
burns
your
stairs
are
devilish
but
if
you
rather
i
went
away
no
do
go
milly
i
perfectly
mad
she
jumped
up
and
waved
her
outstretched
arms
over
the
mass
of
papers
on
the
table
look
at
all
this
three
days
work
rot
abject
rot
i
wish
i
was
dead
i
was
wondering
just
now
whether
it
would
hurt
much
if
one
leaned
too
far
out
of
the
window
and
no
i
did
do
it
as
you
see
what
the
matter
asked
the
other
prosaically
nothing
that
just
it
i
perfectly
well
at
least
i
was
only
now
i
all
trembly
with
drink
she
pointed
to
the
it
the
chance
of
my
life
and
i
ca
take
it
i
ca
work
my
brain
like
batter
and
everything
depends
on
my
idiot
brain
it
has
done
for
these
five
years
that
what
so
awful
it
all
depends
on
me
and
i
going
all
to
pieces
i
told
you
so
rejoined
the
other

summer
and
autumn

it
what

working
for
all
these
years
it
the
best
chance
i
ever
had
and
it
come
when
i
ca
do
it
your
father

doctor

medicine

make
your
head
more
like

less
like
a
suet
pudding
look

said
milly
i
really
came
in
to
ask
you

whitsuntide
but
you

to
our
cottage
at
lymchurch

a
dear
old
girl
in
the
village
mrs
beale

a
glorious
place
for
work
father

he

if

train
no
you
do
my
dear
lunatic
you
are
now
going
to
wash
your
face
and
do
your
hair
and
take
me
out
to
dinner
a
real
eighteenpenny
dinner
at
roches
i
stand
treat
it
was
after
dinner
as
the
two
girls
waited
for
milly
omnibus
that
the
word
of
the
evening
was
spoken
i
do
hope
you
have
a
good
quiet
time
milly
said
and
it
really
is
a
good
place
for
work
poor
edgar
did
a
lot
of
work
there
last
year
there
a
cabinet
with
a
secret
drawer
that
he
said
inspired
him
with
mysterious
tales
and
there
my
why
do
you
say
edgar
jane
asked
smiling
lightly
oh
had
you
heard
awfully
sad
thing
he
sailed
from
new
york
a
fortnight
ago
no
news
of
the
ship
his
mother
in
mourning
i
saw
her
yesterday
quite
broken
down
take
care
of
yourself
and
get
well
and
jolly
jane
stood
long
staring
after
the
swaying
bulk
of
the
omnibus
then
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
went
home
edgar
was
dead
what
a
brute
milly
was
but
of
course
edgar
was
nothing
to
milly
nothing
but
a
pleasant
friend
how
slowly
people
walked
in
the
streets
jane
walked
quickly
so
quickly
that
more
than
one
jostled
stopped
to
stare
after
her
she
had
known
that
he
was
coming
home
and
when
she
had
not
owned
to
herself
that
the
constant
intrusion
of
that
thought
he
is
here
in
london
the
wonder
as
to
when
and
how
she
should
see
him
again
had
counted
for
very
much
in
these
last
days
of
fierce
effort
and
resented
defeat
she
got
back
to
her
rooms
she
remembers
letting
herself
in
with
her
key
she
remembers
that
some
time
during
the
night
she
destroyed
all
those
futile
beginnings
of
stories
also
that
she
found
herself
saying
over
and
over
again
and
very
loud
there
are
the
boys
you
know
there
are
the
boys
because
when
you
have
two
little
brothers
to
keep
you
must
not
allow
yourself
to
forget
it
but
for
the
rest
she
remembers
little
distinctly
only
she
is
sure
that
she
did
not
cry
and
that
she
did
not
sleep
in
the
morning
she
found
her
rooms
very
tidy
and
her
box
packed
she
had
put
in
the
boys
portraits
because
one
must
always
remember
the
boys
she
got
a
cab
and
she
caught
a
train
and
she
reached
the
seaside
cottage
its
little
windows
blinked
firelit
welcome
to
her
as
she
blundered
almost
blindly
out
of
the
station
fly
and
up
the
narrow
path
edged
with
milly
had
telegraphed
mrs
beale
was
there
tremulous
kindly
effective
with
armchairs
wheeled
to
the
april
fire
cups
of
tea
timid
gentle
solicitude
my
word
miss
but
you
do
look
done
up
said
she
the
kettle
just
on
the
boil
and
i
wet
you
a
cup
o
tea
this
instant
minute
and
a
perfect
picture
of
a
chick
ready
for
your
bit
o
dinner
jane
leaned
back
in
the
cushioned
chair
and
looked
round
the
quiet
pleasant
little
room
for
the
moment
it
seemed
good
to
have
a
new
place
to
be
unhappy
in
but
afterwards
when
mrs
beale
had
gone
and
she
was
alone
in
the
house
there
was
time
to
think
all
the
time
there
had
ever
been
since
the
world
began
all
the
time
that
there
would
ever
be
till
the
world
ended
of
that
night
too
jane
can
not
remember
everything
but
she
knows
that
she
did
not
sleep
and
that
her
eyes
were
dry
very
dry
and
burning
as
though
they
had
been
licked
into
place
between
their
lids
by
a
tongue
of
flame
it
was
a
long
night
a
spacious
night
with
room
in
it
for
more
memories
of
edgar
than
she
had
known
herself
mistress
of
edgar
truculent
schoolboy
edgar
at
oxford
superior
to
the
point
of
the
intolerable
edgar
journalist
novelist
war
correspondent
always
friend
edgar
going
to
america
to
lecture
and
make
the
fortune
that
he
said
would
make
all
things
possible
he
had
said
that
on
the
last
evening
when
a
lot
of
them
boys
and
girls
journalists
musicians
art
students
had
gone
to
see
him
off
at
euston
he
had
said
it
at
the
instant
of
farewell
and
had
looked
a
question
had
she
said
yes
or
only
thought
it
she
had
often
wondered
that
even
when
her
brain
was
clear
then
she
pushed
away
the
next
thought
with
both
hands
and
drove
herself
back
to
the
day
when
the
schoolboy
next
door
whom
she
had
admired
and
hated
saved
her
pet
kitten
from
the
butcher
dog
an
heroic
episode
with
blood
in
it
and
tears
edgar
voice
the
touch
of
his
hand
the
swing
of
his
the
way
his
eyes
smiled
before
his
mouth
did
how
bright
his
eyes
were
and
his
hands
were
very
strong
he
was
strong
every
way
he
would
fight
for
his
life
even
with
the
sea
great
smooth
dark
waves
seemed
rushing
upon
her
in
the
quiet
room
she
could
hear
the
sound
of
them
on
the
beach
why
had
she
come
near
the
sea
it
was
the
same
sea
that
she
pushed
the
waves
away
with
both
hands
the
church
clock
struck
two
you
must
go
mad
you
know
she
told
herself
very
gently
and
reasonably
because
of
the
boys
her
hands
had
got
clenched
somehow
her
whole
body
was
rigid
she
relaxed
the
tense
muscles
deliberately
made
up
the
fire
swept
up
the
hearth
the
new
flame
her
touch
inspired
flickered
a
red
reflection
on
the
face
of
the
cabinet
the
cabinet
with
the
secret
drawer
that
had
inspired
edgar
with
mysterious
tales
jane
went
to
it
and
patted
it
and
stroked
it
and
coaxed
it
to
tell
her
its
secret
but
it
would
not
if
it
would
only
inspire
she
said
if
i
could
only
get
an
idea
for
the
story
i
could
do
it
now
this
minute
lots
of
people
work
best
at
night
my
brain
really
quite
clear
again
now
or
else
i
be
able
to
remember
all
these
silly
little
things
no
no
she
cried
to
a
memory
of
a
young
man
kissing
a
glove
a
little
creeping
memory
that
came
to
sting
she
trampled
on
it
next
day
jane
walked
four
miles
to
see
a
doctor
and
get
a
sleeping
draught
you
see
she
explained
very
earnestly
i
have
some
work
to
finish
and
if
i
do
sleep
i
ca
and
i
must
do
it
i
ca
tell
you
how
important
it
is
the
doctor
gave
her
something
in
a
bottle
when
he
had
asked
a
few
questions
and
she
went
back
to
the
cottage
to
go
on
bearing
what
was
left
of
the
interminable
intolerable
day
that
was
the
day
when
she
set
out
the
fair
white
writing
paper
and
the
rosy
and
the
black
ink
and
the
black
fountain
pen
and
sat
and
looked
at
them
for
hours
and
hours
she
prayed
for
help
but
no
help
came
i
probably
praying
to
the
wrong
people
she
said
when
through
the
dusk
the
square
of
paper
showed
vague
as
a
tombstone
in
twilit
grass
the
wrong
people
no
there
are
no
tombstones
in
the
sea
the
wrong
people
if
st
anthony
helps
you
to
find
things
and
the
other
saints
help
you
to
be
good
perhaps
the
dead
people
who
used
to
write
themselves
are
the
ones
to
help
one
to
write
jane
is
ashamed
to
be
quite
sure
that
she
remembers
praying
to
dante
and
shakespeare
and
at
last
to
christina
rossetti
because
she
was
a
woman
and
loved
her
brothers
but
no
help
came
the
old
woman
fussed
in
and
out
with
wood
for
the
fire
candles
food
very
kindly
it
appears
but
jane
wished
she
would
jane
thinks
she
must
have
eaten
some
of
the
food
or
the
old
woman
would
not
have
left
her
as
she
did
jane
took
the
draught
and
went
to
bed
when
mrs
beale
came
into
the
next
morning
a
neat
pile
of
manuscript
lay
on
the
table
and
when
she
took
a
cup
of
tea
to
bedside
jane
was
sleeping
so
placidly
that
the
old
woman
had
not
the
heart
to
disturb
her
and
set
the
tea
down
on
a
chair
by
the
pillow
to
turn
white
and
cold
when
jane
came
into
the
she
stood
long
looking
at
the
manuscript
at
last
she
picked
it
up
and
still
standing
read
it
through
when
she
had
finished
she
stood
a
long
time
with
it
in
her
hand
at
last
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
sat
down
she
wrote
to
milly
here
is
the
story
i
do
know
how
i
done
it
but
here
it
is
do
read
it
because
i
really
am
a
little
mad
and
if
any
good
send
it
in
at
once
to
the
i
slept
all
last
night
i
shall
soon
be
well
now
everything
is
so
delightful
and
the
air
is
splendid
a
thousand
thanks
for
sending
me
here
i
am
enjoying
the
rest
and
change
your
grateful
jane
she
read
it
through
her
smile
at
the
last
phrase
was
not
pretty
to
see
when
the
long
envelope
was
posted
jane
went
down
to
the
quiet
shore
and
gazed
out
over
the
sunlit
sands
to
the
opal
line
of
the
far
receding
tide
the
story
was
written
there
was
an
end
to
the
conflict
of
agonies
so
now
the
fiercer
agony
had
the
field
to
itself
i
suppose
i
shall
learn
to
bear
it
presently
she
told
herself
i
wish
i
had
not
forgotten
how
to
cry
i
am
sure
i
ought
to
cry
but
the
story
is
done
anyway
i
daresay
i
shall
remember
how
to
cry
before
the
next
story
has
to
be
done
there
were
two
more
nights
and
one
whole
day
the
nights
had
islands
of
sleep
in
them
hot
misty
islands
in
a
river
of
slow
crawling
sluggish
hours
the
day
was
light
and
breezy
and
sunny
with
a
blue
sky
the
day
was
worse
than
the
nights
because
in
the
day
she
remembered
all
the
time
who
she
was
and
where
it
was
on
the
last
day
of
the
week
she
was
sitting
rigid
in
the
little
porch
her
eyes
tracing
again
and
again
with
conscious
intentness
the
twisted
pattern
of
the
budding
honeysuckle
stalks
a
rattle
of
wheels
suddenly
checked
came
to
her
and
she
untwisted
her
stiff
fingers
and
went
down
the
path
to
meet
milly
a
pale
milly
with
red
spots
in
her
cheeks
and
fierce
frowning
brows
a
milly
who
drew
back
from
the
offered
kiss
and
spoke
in
tones
that
neither
had
heard
before
come
inside
i
want
to
speak
to
you
the
new
disaster
thus
plainly
heralded
moved
jane
not
at
all
there
was
no
room
in
her
soul
for
any
more
pain
in
the
little
conscientiously
quaint
with
its
spotted
crockery
dogs
and
corner
cupboard
shining
with
willow
pattern
milly
shut
the
door
and
turned
on
her
friend
now
she
said
i
came
down
to
see
you
because
there
are
some
things
i
could
write
even
to
you
you
can
go
back
to
the
station
in
the
cab
i
told
the
man
to
wait
and
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
your
face
again
what
do
you
mean
jane
asked
the
question
mechanically
and
not
at
all
because
she
did
not
know
the
answer
you
know
what
i
mean
the
other
answered
still
with
white
fury
found
you
out
you
thought
you
were
safe
and
edgar
was
dead
and
no
one
would
know
but
as
it
happens
knew
and
so
shall
everybody
else
jane
moistened
dry
lips
and
said
knew
what
and
held
on
by
the
table
you
did
think
he
told
about
it
did
you
milly
flashed
but
he
did
i
think
you
must
tell
what
you
mean
jane
said
and
shifted
her
hold
from
table
to
armchair
oh
certainly
milly
tossed
her
head
and
jane
fingers
tightened
on
the
yes
i
do
wonder
you
look
ill
i
suppose
you
were
sorry
when
you
done
it
but
it
no
use
being
sorry
you
should
have
thought
of
all
that
before
tell
me
said
jane
low
i
tell
you
fast
enough
you
shall
see
i
do
know
well
then
that
story
you
sent
me
you
just
copied
it
from
a
story
of
edgar
that
was
in
the
old
cabinet
he
wrote
it
when
he
was
here
and
he
said
it
good
and
i
said
it
was
and
then
he
said
he
leave
it
in
the
secret
drawer
and
see
how
it
looked
when
he
came
back
and
you
found
it
and
you
thought
you
were
very
clever
i
daresay
and
that
edgar
was
dead
and
no
one
would
know
but
i
knew
and
yes
jane
interrupted
you
said
that
before
so
you
think
i
found
edgar
manuscript
if
i
did
it
i
must
have
done
it
in
my
sleep
i
used
to
walk
in
my
sleep
when
i
was
a
child
you
believe
me
milly
you
no
said
milly
i
do
then
i
say
nothing
more
said
jane
with
bitter
dignity
i
will
go
at
once
and
i
will
try
to
forgive
your
cruelty
would
never
have
doubted
word
never
i
am
very
ill
look
at
me
i
had
a
sleeping
draught
and
i
suppose
it
upset
me
such
things
have
happened
known
me
eight
or
nine
years
have
you
ever
known
me
do
a
dishonourable
thing
or
tell
a
lie
the
dishonour
is
in
yourself
to
believe
such
things
of
me
jane
had
drawn
herself
up
and
stood
tall
and
haggard
her
dark
eyes
glowing
in
their
deep
sockets
the
other
woman
was
daunted
she
hesitated
stammered
half
a
word
and
was
silent
said
jane
and
i
hope
to
god
no
one
will
ever
be
such
a
brute
to
you
as
you
have
been
to
me
she
turned
but
before
she
reached
the
door
milly
had
caught
her
by
the
arm
no
do
do
she
cried
i
believe
you
i
do
you
poor
darling
you
must
have
done
it
in
your
sleep
oh
forgive
me
jane
dear
i
never
tell
a
soul
and
edgar
ah
said
jane
turning
mournful
eyes
on
her
edgar
would
have
believed
in
me
and
at
that
milly
understood
in
part
at
least
and
held
out
her
arms
oh
you
poor
dear
and
i
never
even
guessed
oh
forgive
me
and
she
cried
over
jane
and
kissed
her
many
times
oh
my
dear
she
said
as
jane
yielded
herself
to
the
arms
and
her
face
to
the
kisses
i
got
something
to
tell
you
you
must
be
brave
no
no
more
jane
said
shrilly
i
ca
bear
any
more
i
do
want
to
know
how
it
happened
or
anything
he
dead
that
enough
but
milly
clung
sobbing
to
her
sobbing
with
sympathy
and
agitation
jane
pushed
her
back
held
her
at
arm
length
and
looked
at
her
with
eyes
that
were
still
dry
you
a
good
little
thing
after
all
she
said
yes
now
i
tell
you
you
were
quite
right
it
was
a
lie
but
half
of
it
was
true
the
half
i
told
you
but
i
wanted
you
to
believe
the
other
half
too
i
did
walk
in
my
sleep
and
i
must
have
opened
that
cabinet
and
taken
story
out
because
i
found
myself
standing
there
with
it
in
my
hands
and
he
was
dead
and
oh
milly
i
knew
he
was
dead
of
course
and
yet
he
was
there
i
give
you
my
word
he
was
there
and
i
heard
him
say
it
take
it
take
it
quite
plainly
like
i
speaking
to
you
now
and
i
took
it
and
i
copied
it
out
it
took
me
nearly
all
night
and
then
i
sent
it
to
you
and
i
never
have
told
you
the
truth
as
long
as
you
did
believe
me
never
never
but
now
you
do
believe
me
i
wo
lie
to
you
there
let
me
go
i
think
i
was
mad
then
and
i
know
i
am
now
tell
every
one
i
do
care
but
milly
threw
her
arms
round
her
again
the
love
interest
had
overpowered
the
moral
sense
what
did
the
silly
story
or
the
theft
or
the
lie
matter
what
were
they
compared
with
the
she
had
surprised
my
darling
jane
she
said
holding
her
friend
closely
and
still
weeping
lavishly
do
worry
about
the
story
i
quite
understand
let
forget
it
you
got
quite
enough
trouble
to
bear
without
that
but
there
one
thing
it
just
as
well
i
found
out
before
the
story
was
published
because
edgar
is
dead
his
ship
has
been
towed
in
he
at
home
jane
laughed
do
cry
dear
said
milly
i
help
you
to
bear
it
only
oh
dear
how
awful
it
is
for
you
he
going
to
be
married
jane
laughed
again
and
then
she
thinks
the
great
green
waves
really
did
rise
up
all
round
the
quaint
rise
mountains
high
and
falling
cover
her
jane
was
ill
so
long
that
milly
had
to
tell
edgar
about
the
story
after
all
and
they
sent
it
in
and
it
was
published
in
jane
name
so
the
little
brothers
were
all
right
and
he
wrote
the
next
story
for
her
too
and
they
corrected
the
proofs
together
jane
has
always
thought
it
a
pity
that
milly
had
not
troubled
to
ask
the
name
of
the
girl
whom
edgar
intended
to
marry
because
the
name
proved
on
enquiry
to
be
jane
v
the
millionairess
i
it
is
a
dismal
thing
to
be
in
london
in
august
the
streets
are
up
for
one
thing
and
your
cab
can
never
steer
a
straight
course
for
the
place
you
want
to
go
to
and
the
trees
are
brown
in
the
parks
and
every
one
you
know
is
away
so
that
there
would
be
nowhere
to
go
in
your
cab
even
if
you
had
the
money
to
pay
for
it
and
you
could
go
there
without
extravagance
stephen
guillemot
sat
over
his
uncomfortable
in
the
rooms
he
shared
with
his
friend
and
cursed
his
luck
his
friend
was
away
by
the
sea
and
he
was
here
in
the
dirty
and
sordid
blackness
of
his
temple
chambers
but
he
had
no
money
for
a
holiday
and
when
dornington
had
begged
him
to
accept
a
loan
he
had
sworn
at
dornington
and
dornington
had
gone
off
not
at
all
pleased
and
now
dornington
was
by
the
sea
and
he
was
here
the
flies
buzzed
in
the
panes
and
round
the
sticky
marmalade
jar
the
sun
poured
in
at
the
open
window
there
was
no
work
to
do
stephen
was
a
solicitor
by
trade
but
in
fact
and
perforce
an
idler
no
business
came
to
him
all
day
long
the
steps
of
clients
sounded
on
the
dirty
old
wooden
staircase
clients
for
robinson
on
the
second
for
jones
on
the
fourth
but
none
for
guillemot
on
the
third
even
now
steps
were
coming
though
it
was
only
ten
the
young
man
glanced
at
the
marmalade
jar
at
the
crooked
cloth
stained
with
tea
which
his
laundress
had
spread
for
his
breakfast
suppose
it
is
a
client
he
broke
off
with
a
laugh
he
had
never
been
able
to
cure
himself
of
that
old
hope
that
some
day
the
feet
of
a
client
a
wealthy
client
would
pause
at
his
door
but
the
feet
had
always
gone
by
as
these
would
do
the
steps
did
indeed
pass
his
door
paused
came
back
and
oh
wonder
it
was
knocker
that
awoke
the
temple
echoes
he
glanced
at
the
table
it
was
hopeless
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
daresay
it
only
a
bill
he
said
and
went
to
see
the
newcomer
was
impatient
for
even
as
guillemot
opened
the
door
the
knocker
was
in
act
to
fall
again
is
mr
guillemot
oh
stephen
i
should
have
known
you
anywhere
a
radiant
vision
in
a
white
linen
gown
a
very
smart
linen
gown
and
a
big
white
hat
was
standing
in
his
doorway
shaking
him
warmly
by
the
hand
wo
you
ask
me
in
asked
the
vision
smiling
in
his
bewildered
face
he
drew
back
mechanically
and
closed
the
door
after
him
as
she
went
in
then
he
followed
her
into
the
room
that
served
him
for
office
and
and
stood
looking
at
her
helplessly
you
do
know
me
a
bit
she
said
it
a
shame
to
tease
you
take
off
my
hat
and
veil
you
will
know
me
then
it
these
fine
feathers
and
take
them
off
she
did
in
front
of
the
glass
on
the
then
she
turned
a
bright
face
on
him
a
pretty
mobile
face
crowned
with
bright
brown
hair
and
still
he
stood
abashed
i
never
thought
you
would
have
forgotten
the
friend
of
hour
she
began
again
i
see
i
must
tell
you
in
cold
blood
why
it
rosamund
he
cried
suddenly
do
forgive
me
i
never
never
dreamed
my
dear
rosamund
you
are
really
changed
a
bit
only
your
hair
being
done
up
and
and
the
fine
feathers
said
she
holding
out
a
fold
of
her
dress
they
are
very
pretty
feathers
are
they
very
said
he
and
then
suddenly
a
silence
of
embarrassment
fell
between
them
the
girl
broke
it
with
a
laugh
that
was
not
quite
spontaneous
how
funny
it
all
is
she
said
i
went
to
new
york
with
my
uncle
when
dear
papa
died
and
then
i
went
to
girton
and
now
poor
uncle
dead
and
her
eye
fell
on
the
tablecloth
i
going
to
clear
away
this
horrid
breakfast
of
yours
she
said
oh
please
he
pleaded
taking
the
marmalade
jar
up
in
his
helpless
hands
she
took
the
jar
from
him
yes
i
am
she
said
firmly
and
you
can
just
sit
down
and
try
to
remember
who
i
am
he
obediently
withdrew
to
the
and
watched
her
as
she
took
away
the
ugly
crockery
and
the
uglier
food
to
hide
them
in
his
little
kitchen
and
as
he
watched
her
he
remembered
many
things
the
lonely
childhood
in
a
country
rectory
the
long
dull
days
with
no
playfellows
then
the
arrival
of
the
new
doctor
and
his
little
daughter
rosamund
rainham
and
almost
at
the
same
time
it
seemed
the
invalid
lady
with
the
little
boy
who
lodged
at
the
post
office
then
there
were
playfellows
dear
playfellows
to
cheer
and
teach
him
poor
stephen
he
hardly
knew
what
play
or
laughter
meant
then
the
invalid
lady
died
and
stephen
father
awoke
from
his
dreams
amid
his
old
books
as
he
had
a
way
of
doing
now
and
then
enquired
into
the
circumstances
of
the
boy
andrew
dornington
and
finding
him
friendless
and
homeless
took
him
into
his
home
to
be
stephen
little
brother
and
friend
then
the
long
happy
time
when
the
three
children
were
always
together
walking
boating
birdsnesting
reading
playing
and
quarrelling
the
storm
of
tears
from
rosamund
when
the
boys
went
to
college
the
shock
of
surprise
and
the
fleeting
sadness
with
which
stephen
heard
that
the
doctor
was
dead
and
that
rosamund
had
gone
to
america
to
her
mother
brother
then
the
fulness
of
living
the
old
days
almost
forgotten
or
only
remembered
as
a
pleasant
dream
stephen
had
never
thought
to
see
rosamund
again
had
certainly
never
longed
very
ardently
to
see
her
at
any
rate
since
the
year
of
her
going
and
now
here
she
was
grown
to
womanhood
and
charm
clearing
away
his
breakfast
things
he
could
hear
the
tap
running
and
knew
that
she
must
be
washing
her
hands
at
the
sink
using
the
horrid
bit
of
yellow
soap
with
embedded
in
it
now
she
was
drying
her
hands
on
the
dingy
towel
behind
the
kitchen
door
no
she
came
in
drying
her
pink
fingers
on
her
handkerchief
what
a
horrid
old
charwoman
you
must
have
she
said
everything
is
six
inches
deep
in
dust
and
all
your
crockery
is
smeary
i
am
sorry
it
not
nicer
he
said
oh
but
it
good
to
see
you
again
what
times
we
used
to
have
do
you
remember
when
we
burned
your
dolls
on
the
of
november
i
should
think
i
did
and
do
you
remember
when
i
painted
your
new
and
the
handles
of
your
saws
and
gimlets
and
things
with
pale
green
enamel
i
thought
you
would
be
so
pleased
she
had
taken
her
place
as
she
spoke
in
the
depths
of
the
one
comfortable
chair
and
he
answered
from
his
and
in
a
moment
the
two
were
launched
on
a
flood
of
reminiscences
and
the
flight
of
time
was
not
one
of
the
things
they
remembered
the
hour
and
the
quarters
sounded
and
they
talked
on
but
the
insistence
of
noon
boomed
by
the
law
courts
clock
brought
miss
rainham
to
her
feet
twelve
she
cried
how
time
goes
and
i
never
told
you
what
i
came
for
look
here
i
frightfully
rich
i
only
heard
it
last
week
my
uncle
never
seemed
very
well
off
we
lived
very
simply
and
i
used
to
do
the
and
the
dusting
and
things
and
now
he
died
and
left
me
all
his
money
i
do
know
where
he
kept
it
all
the
people
on
the
floor
above
here
wrote
me
about
it
i
was
going
to
see
them
and
i
saw
your
name
and
i
simply
could
pass
it
look
here
stephen
are
you
very
busy

too
busy
to
do
anything

glad
you
had
luck
what

i
do
for
you
will
you
really
do
anything
i
want
promise
of
course
i
promise
he
looked
at
her
and
wondered
if
she
knew
how
hard
it
would
be
to
him
to
refuse
her
anything
for
mr
guillemot
had
been
fancy
free
and
this
gracious
vision
from
old
times
had
turned
his
head
a
little
good
you
must
be
my
solicitor
but
i
ca
jones
bother
jones
she
said
i
sha
go
near
him
i
wo
be
worried
by
jones
what
is
the
use
of
having
a
fortune
and
it
a
big
fortune
i
can
tell
you
if
i
may
even
choose
my
own
solicitor
look
here
stephen
really
i

no
relations
and
no
friends
in
england
no
man
friends

mean
and
you
wo
charge
me
more
than
you
ought
but
you
will
charge
me
enough
oh
i
feel
like
mr
boffin
and
you
are
mortimer
lightwood
and
andrew
is
eugene
do
you
call
him
dora
still
it
was
the
first
question
she
had
asked
about
the
boy
who
had
shared
all
their
youth
with
them
oh
dornington
is
all
right
he
be
awfully
sick
if
you
called
him
dora
nowadays
he
got
on
a
little
not
much
he
goes
in
for
journalism
he
at
lymchurch
just
now
he
lives
here
with
me
generally
yes
i
know
i
saw
his
name
on
the
door
and
stephen
did
not
wonder
till
later
why
she
had
not
mentioned
that
name
earlier
in
the
interview
here
give
me
paper
and
pens
the
best
there
is
time
to
procure
now
tell
me
what
to
say
to
jones
i
want
to
tell
him
that
i
loathe
his
very
name
that
i
know
i
could
never
bear
the
sight
of
him
and
that
you
are
going
to
look
after
everything
for
me
he
resisted
she
pleaded
and
at
last
the
letter
was
written
not
quite
in
those
terms
and
stephen
at
her
request
reluctantly
instructed
her
as
to
the
method
of
giving
a
power
of
attorney
you
must
arrange
everything
she
said
i
wo
be
bothered
now
i
must
go
jones
is
human
after
all
he
knew
i
should
want
money
and
he
sent
me
quite
a
lot
and
i
am
going
away
for
a
holiday
just
to
see
what
it
feels
like
to
be
rich
you
not
going
about
alone
i
hope
said
stephen
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
remembered
that
beautiful
young
ladies
are
not
allowed
to
clear
away
in
the
temple
without
a
chaperon
even
for
their
solicitors
no
constance
grant
is
with
me
you
do
know
her
i
got
to
know
her
at
girton
she
a
dear
look
here
he
said
awkwardly
standing
behind
her
as
she
pinned
her
hat
and
veil
in
front
of
his
glass
when
you
come
back
i
come
to
see
you
but
you
must
come
here
again
it
it
not
customary
she
smiled
at
his
reflection
in
the
glass
oh
i
forgot
your
stiff
english
notions
so
absurd
not
going
to
see
one
old
friend
one
however
i
wo
come
where
i
not
wanted
you
know
he
began
reproachfully
but
she
interrupted
oh
yes
it
all
right
now
remember
that
all
my
affairs
are
in
your
hands
and
when
i
come
back
you
will
have
to
tell
me
exactly
what
i
am
worth
between
eight
and
fourteen
hundred
thousand
pounds
they
say
but
nonsense
is
it
and
with
a
last
switch
of
white
skirts
against
the
dirty
wainscot
and
a
last
wave
of
a
hand
she
disappeared
down
the
staircase
stephen
drew
a
long
breath
it
ca
be
fourteen
hundred
thousand
he
said
slowly
but
i
wish
to
goodness
it
was
ii
the
tide
was
low
the
long
lines
of
the
sandbanks
shone
yellow
in
the
sun
yellower
for
the
pools
of
blue
water
left
between
them
far
off
where
the
low
white
streak
marked
the
edge
of
the
still
retreating
sea
little
figures
moved
slowly
along
pushing
the
through
the
shallow
water
on
one
of
the
smooth
groins
a
girl
sat
sketching
the
village
her
pink
gown
and
red
japanese
umbrella
made
a
bright
spot
on
the
gold
of
the
sand
further
along
the
beach
under
the
end
of
the
a
young
man
and
woman
basked
in
the
august
sun
her
sunshade
was
white
and
so
were
her
gown
and
the
hat
that
lay
beside
her
since
her
accession
to
fortune
rosamund
rainham
had
worn
nothing
but
white
it
is
the
prettiest
wear
in
the
world
she
had
told
constance
grant
and
when
you
poor
it
the
most
impossible
but
now
i
can
have
a
clean
gown
every
day
and
a
clean
conscience
as
well
i
not
sure
about
the
conscience
constance
had
answered
with
her
demure
smile
think
of
the
millions
of
poor
people
oh
bother
miss
rainham
had
laughed
not
heartlessly
but
happily
thank
heaven
i
enough
to
be
happy
myself
and
make
heaps
of
other
people
happy
too
and
the
first
step
is
that
no
one
to
know
i
rich
so
remember
that
we
are
two
teachers
on
a
holiday
i
loathe
constance
had
said
but
she
had
submitted
and
now
she
sat
sketching
and
rosamund
in
her
white
gown
watched
the
seagulls
and
shrimpers
from
under
the
of
lymchurch
and
so
your
holiday
over
in
three
days
she
was
saying
to
the
young
man
beside
her
it
been
a
good
time
has
it
he
did
not
answer
he
was
piling
up
the
pebbles
in
a
heap
and
always
at
a
certain
point
the
heap
collapsed
what
are
you
thinking
of
poems
again
i
had
a
verse
running
in
my
head
he
said
apologetically
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
anything
write
it
down
at
once
she
said
imperiously
and
he
obediently
scribbled
in
his
notebook
while
she
took
up
the
work
of
building
the
stone
heap
it
grew
higher
under
her
light
fingers
read
it
she
said
when
the
scribbling
of
the
pencil
stopped
and
he
read
now
the
vexed
clouds
spread
wings
of
white
long
leaning
wings
across
the
sea
and
land
the
waves
creep
back
bequeathing
to
our
sight
the
of
their
deserted
sand
and
where
the
nearer
waves
curl
white
and
low
in
swirling
brine
the
shrimpers
go
pale
breadth
of
sand
where
clamorous
gulls
confer
marked
with
broad
arrows
by
their
planted
feet
white
rippled
pools
where
late
deep
waters
were
and
ever
the
white
waves
marshalled
in
retreat
and
the
grey
wind
in
sole
supremacy
opal
and
amber
cold
of
darkening
sky
and
sea
opal
and
amber
cold
she
repeated
it
not
like
that
now
sapphire
and
gold
and
diamonds
yes
he
said
but
that
was
how
it
was
last
week
before
i
came
yes
before
you
came
his
tone
put
a
new
meaning
into
her
words
i
glad
i
brought
good
weather
she
said
cheerfully
and
the
little
stone
heap
rattled
itself
down
under
her
hand
you
brought
the
light
of
the
world
he
said
and
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
there
was
a
silence
a
fisherman
passing
along
the
gave
them
what
made
you
come
to
lymchurch
he
said
presently
and
his
hand
lay
lightly
on
hers
she
hesitated
and
looked
down
at
her
hand
and
his
i
knew
you
were
here
she
said
his
eyes
met
hers
i
always
meant
to
see
you
again
some
day
and
you
knew
me
at
once
that
was
so
nice
of
you
you
have
not
changed
he
said
your
face
has
not
changed
only
you
are
older
and
i
you
need
reproach
me
with
it
yours
is
the
same
to
a
month
he
moved
on
his
elbow
a
little
nearer
to
her
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
he
asked
looking
out
to
sea
that
you
and
i
were
made
for
each
other
no
never
he
looked
out
to
sea
still
and
his
face
clouded
heavily
ah
no
do
look
like
that
dear
it
never
occurred
to
me
i
think
i
must
have
always
known
it
somehow
only
only
what
do
you
really
only
what
a
silence
then
only
what
he
asked
again
only
i
was
so
afraid
it
would
never
occur
to
there
was
no
one
on
the
wide
bare
sands
save
the
discreet
artist
their
faces
were
very
near
we
shall
be
very
very
poor
i
afraid
he
said
presently
i
can
go
on
teaching
no
his
voice
was
decided
my
wife
sha
work
at
least
not
anywhere
but
in
our
home
you
wo
mind
playing
at
love
in
a
cottage
for
a
bit
will
you
i
shall
get
on
now
i
something
to
work
for
oh
my
dear
thank
god
i
enough
for
the
cottage
when
will
you
marry
me
nothing
to
wait
for
no
relations
to
consult
no
settlements
to
draw
up
all
that
mine
is
thine
lassie
and
all
that
mine
oh
stephen
for
with
a
scattering
of
shingle
a
man
dropped
from
the
two
yards
from
them
the
situation
admitted
of
no
disguise
for
miss
rainham
head
was
on
mr
dornington
shoulder
they
sprang
up
why
stephen
echoed
andrew
this
this
is
good
of
you
you
remember
rosamund
we
have
just
found
out
that
but
rosamund
had
turned
and
was
walking
quickly
away
over
the
sand
stephen
filled
a
pipe
and
lighted
it
before
he
said
you
made
good
use
of
your
time
old
man
i
congratulate
you
his
tone
was
cold
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
not
make
good
use
of
my
time
dornington
answered
and
his
tone
had
caught
the
chill
of
the
other
none
whatever
you
have
secured
the
prize
and
i
congratulate
you
whether
it
fair
to
the
girl
is
another
question
in
moments
of
agitation
a
man
instinctively
feels
for
his
pipe
it
was
now
dornington
turn
to
fill
and
light
of
course
it
your
own
affair
said
guillemot
chafing
at
the
silence
but
i
think
you
might
have
given
the
heiress
a
chance
however
it
each
for
himself
i
suppose
and
heiress
yes
the
heiress
the
millionairess
if
you
prefer
it
i
been
looking
into
her
affairs
it
just
about
a
million
rather
cheap
chaff
is
it
it
a
very
lucky
thing
for
you
said
stephen
savagely
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
grudge
it
to
you
but
i
must
say
dornington
i
see
we
look
at
the
thing
differently
but
i
must
say
i
should
have
cared
to
grab
at
such
luck
myself
dornington
had
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
stood
looking
at
his
friend
i
see
he
said
slowly
and
her
fortune
is
really
so
much
i
think
it
had
been
so
much
as
that
yes
well
guillemot
it
no
good
making
a
row
about
it
i
do
want
to
quarrel
with
my
best
friend
go
along
to
my
place
will
you
or
stay
come
and
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
grant
and
you
can
walk
up
with
her
she
show
you
where
i
live
i
going
for
a
bit
of
a
walk
five
minutes
later
stephen
in
response
to
rosamund
beckoning
hand
at
the
window
was
following
miss
grant
up
the
narrow
flagged
path
leading
to
the
cottage
which
rosamund
had
taken
and
ten
minutes
later
andrew
dornington
was
striding
along
the
road
to
the
station
with
a
gladstone
bag
in
his
hands
stephen
lunched
at
the
cottage
the
girls
served
the
lunch
themselves
they
had
no
hired
service
in
the
little
cottage
rosamund
exerted
herself
to
talk
gaily
as
the
meal
ended
a
child
stood
in
the
door
that
opened
straight
from
the
street
into
the
after
the
primitive
fashion
of
lymchurch
gave
me
a
letter
for
you
said
the
child
and
rosamund
took
it
giving
in
exchange
some
fruit
from
the
pretty
disordered
table
excuse
me
she
said
with
the
rose
in
her
cheeks
because
she
saw
the
was
the
she
had
seen
in
many
pencilled
verses
she
read
the
letter
frowned
read
it
again
constance
you
might
get
the
coffee
constance
went
out
then
the
girl
turned
on
her
guest
this
is
doing
she
said
with
a
concentrated
fury
that
brought
him
to
his
feet
facing
her
why
did
you
come
and
meddle
you
told
him
i
was
rich
the
very
thing
i
did
mean
him
to
know
till
till
he
could
help
himself
you
spoilt
everything
and
now
he
gone
and
he
never
come
back
oh
i
hope
you
will
suffer
for
this
some
day
you
will
if
there
any
justice
in
the
world
he
looked
as
though
he
suffered
for
it
even
now
but
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
equable
i
am
extremely
sorry
he
said
but
after
all
there
very
little
harm
done
you
should
have
warned
me
that
you
meant
to
play
a
comedy
and
i
would
have
taken
any
part
you
assigned
me
however
succeeded
he
evidently
you
for
yourself
alone
write
and
tell
him
to
come
back
he
come
how
little
you
know
him
she
said
after
all
these
years
even
i
know
him
better
than
that
that
was
why
i
pretended
not
to
be
rich
directly
i
knew
about
the
money
i
made
up
my
mind
to
find
him
and
try
if
i
could
make
him
care
i
know
it
sounds
horrid
i
do
mind
it
true
and
i
had
done
it
and
then
you
came
oh
i
hope
i
shall
never
see
you
again
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
no
i
do
mean
that
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
rosamund
try
to
forgive
me
i
did
know
i
could
know
i
will
bring
him
back
to
you
i
swear
it
only
trust
me
you
ca
she
said
it
all
over
let
me
tell
you
something
if
you
had
had
this
money
but
if
you
had
had
this
money
i
should
never
have
seen
you
but
i
have
thought
of
nothing
but
you
ever
since
that
day
you
came
to
the
temple
i
tell
you
this
to
annoy
you
only
to
show
you
that
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
prevent
you
from
being
unhappy
forgive
me
dear
oh
forgive
me
it
no
good
she
said
but
she
gave
him
her
hand
when
constance
grant
came
back
with
the
coffee
she
found
mr
guillemot
alone
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
sunflowers
and
the
hollyhocks
what
is
the
matter
she
asked
i
made
a
fool
of
myself
he
said
forgetting
as
he
looked
at
her
kind
eyes
that
three
hours
ago
she
was
only
a
name
to
him
could
i
do
anything
you
her
friend
he
said
miss
grant
i
going
down
to
the
sea
if
you
could
come
down
with
me
and
let
me
talk
but
i
no
right
to
bother
you
i
come
said
constance
i
come
when
i
cleared
lunch
away
it
no
bother
as
you
say
i
her
friend
iii
rosamund
stayed
on
at
the
little
house
behind
the
and
she
wrote
letters
long
and
many
which
accumulated
on
the
of
the
rooms
in
the
temple
andrew
found
them
there
when
he
returned
to
town
in
the
middle
of
october
the
room
was
cheerless
tenantless
fireless
he
lit
the
gas
and
looked
through
his
letters
he
did
not
dare
to
open
those
which
came
from
her
there
were
bills
invitation
cards
a
returned
manuscript
or
two
a
cheque
for
a
magazine
article
and
a
letter
in
stephen
it
was
dated
a
fortnight
earlier
dear
old
chap
it
ran
i
off
to
my
father
i
ca
bear
it
i
ca
face
you
or
any
one
i
wish
to
god
i
never
told
you
anything
about
rosamund
rainham
money
there
is
any
money
it
was
all
in
the
crystal
oil
no
one
had
the
least
idea
that
it
was
good
but
i
feel
as
if
i
ought
to
have
known
there
a
beggarly
hundred
or
so
in
consols
that
the
end
of
her
million
it
was
really
my
fault
of
course
she
does
blame
yours
stephen
guillemot
then
he
opened
her
letters
read
them
all
in
the
order
of
the
dates
on
the
postmarks
for
even
in
love
andrew
was
an
orderly
man
read
them
with
eyes
that
pricked
and
smarted
there
were
four
or
five
of
them
first
the
frank
pleading
of
affection
then
the
coldness
of
hurt
pride
and
love
then
doubts
wonderings
was
he
ill
was
he
away
would
he
not
at
least
answer
passionate
longing
tender
anxiety
breathed
in
every
word
then
came
the
last
letter
of
all
written
a
fortnight
ago
dear
andrew
i
want
you
to
understand
that
all
is
over
between
us
i
know
you
wished
it
and
now
i
see
you
are
right
i
could
never
have
been
anything
to
you
but
your
loving
friend
rosamund
he
read
it
through
twice
it
was
a
greater
shock
to
him
than
letter
had
been
then
he
understood
the
millionairess
might
stoop
to
woo
a
poor
lover
whose
pride
had
fought
with
and
conquered
his
love
the
girl
with
only
a
beggarly
hundred
in
consols
had
her
pride
too
the
early
october
dusk
filled
the
room
andrew
caught
up
the
bag
he
had
brought
with
him
slammed
the
door
and
blundered
down
the
stairs
he
caught
a
passing
hansom
in
fleet
street
and
the
last
train
to
lymchurch
a
furious
was
waiting
for
him
there
he
could
hardly
stand
against
it
it
blew
and
tore
and
buffeted
him
almost
prevailing
against
him
as
he
staggered
down
the
road
from
the
station
the
night
was
inky
black
but
he
knew
his
lymchurch
every
inch
and
he
fought
it
manfully
though
every
now
and
then
he
was
fain
to
cling
to
a
gateway
or
a
post
and
hold
on
till
the
gust
had
passed
thus
breathless
and
dishevelled
his
tie
under
his
left
ear
his
hat
battered
in
his
hair
in
crisp
disorder
he
reached
at
last
the
haven
of
the
little
porch
of
the
house
under
the
rosamund
herself
opened
the
door
her
eyes
showed
him
two
things
her
love
and
her
pride
which
would
be
the
stronger
he
remembered
how
the
question
had
been
answered
in
his
own
case
and
he
shivered
as
she
took
his
hand
and
led
him
into
the
warm
room
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
hearth
swept
a
tabby
cat
purred
on
the
rug
a
book
lay
open
on
the
table
all
breathed
of
the
sober
comfort
of
home
she
sat
down
on
the
other
side
of
the
hearth
and
looked
at
him
neither
spoke
it
was
an
awkward
moment
rosamund
broke
the
silence
it
is
very
friendly
of
you
to
come
and
see
me
she
said
it
is
very
lonely
for
me
now
constance
has
gone
back
to
london
she
has
gone
back
to
her
teaching
yes
i
wanted
her
to
stay
but
i
heard
from
stephen
he
is
very
wretched
he
seems
to
think
it
is
his
fault
poor
dear
boy
she
spoke
musingly
of
course
it
was
his
fault
it
all
seems
like
a
dream
to
have
been
so
rich
for
a
little
while
and
to
have
done
nothing
with
it
except
she
added
with
a
laugh
and
a
glance
at
her
dress
to
buy
a
most
extravagant
number
of
white
dresses
how
awfully
tired
you
look
andrew
go
and
have
a
wash
the
spare
room
the
first
door
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
i
get
you
some
supper
when
he
came
down
again
she
had
laid
a
cloth
on
the
table
and
was
setting
out
silver
and
glass
another
relic
of
my
brief
prosperity
she
said
touching
the
forks
and
spoons
i
glad
i
do
have
to
eat
with
things
she
talked
gaily
as
they
ate
the
home
atmosphere
of
the
room
touched
dornington
rosamund
herself
in
her
white
gown
had
never
appeared
so
fair
and
desirable
and
but
for
his
own
mad
pride
he
might
have
been
here
now
sharing
her
pretty
little
home
life
with
her
not
as
her
guest
but
as
her
husband
he
flushed
crimson
blushing
was
an
old
trick
of
his
one
of
those
that
had
earned
him
his
feminine
nickname
of
dora
and
in
the
confusion
his
blushing
brought
him
he
spoke
rosamund
can
you
ever
forgive
me
i
forgive
you
from
my
heart
she
said
if
i
have
anything
to
forgive
but
in
her
tone
was
the
resentment
of
a
woman
who
does
not
forgive
yet
he
had
been
right
he
had
sacrificed
himself
and
if
he
had
chosen
to
suffer
but
what
about
the
blue
lines
under
her
dear
eyes
the
hollows
in
her
dear
face
you
have
been
unhappy
he
said
well
she
laughed
i
was
exactly
pleased
to
lose
my
fortune
dear
he
said
desperately
wo
you
try
to
forgive
me
it
seemed
right
how
could
i
sacrifice
you
to
a
penniless
i
enough
for
both
or
thought
i
had
she
said
obstinately
ah
but
do
you
see
i
see
that
you
cared
more
for
not
being
thought
mercenary
by
stephen
than
forgive
me
he
pleaded
take
me
back
oh
no
she
tossed
her
bright
head
stephen
might
think
me
mercenary
i
could
bear
you
see
you
are
richer
than
i
am
now
how
much
did
you

morning

then
in
the
morning
andrew
went
into
the
fresh
air
the
trees
still
gold
in
calmer
homes
stood
almost
leafless
in
wild
windy
lymchurch
he
stood
in
the
sunlight
and
in
spite
of
himself
some
sort
of
gladness
came
to
him
through
the
crisp
october
air
then
the
of
a
bicycle
bell
sounded
close
behind
him
and
there
was
stephen
they
shook
hands
and
stephen
eyebrows
went
up
is
it
all
right
he
asked
i
knew
you
come
here
when
i
came
home
last
night
and
found
you
had
my
letter
no
it
not
all
right
she
wo
have
me
why
pride
or
revenge
or
something
do
let
talk
about
it
all
right
i
want
some
breakfast
we
left
town
by
the
starving
who
are
miss
grant
and
i
thought
rosamund
would
be
wanting
a
or
a
bridesmaid
or
something
so
i
brought
her
and
her
bicycle
always
thoughtful
said
andrew
with
something
like
a
laugh
presently
strolling
along
the
they
met
the
two
girls
rosamund
looked
radiant
where
was
the
pale
darling
of
last
night
the
wind
that
ruffled
her
brown
hair
had
blown
roses
into
her
cheeks
do
you
forgive
me
whispered
stephen
when
they
met
that
depends
she
answered
they
all
walked
on
together
and
presently
stephen
and
constance
fell
behind
then
rosamund
spoke
you
really
think
i
ought
to
crush
my
pride
and
and
hope
laughed
in
andrew
face
laughed
and
fled
for
he
looked
in
the
face
of
miss
rainham
and
there
was
no
sign
of
yielding
in
it
yes
he
said
almost
sullenly
that
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
were
wrong
i
perhaps
i
was
wrong
what
does
it
matter
it
matters
greatly
suppose
i
had
my
money
now
would
you
run
away
from
me
i
i
suppose
i
should
act
as
i
did
before
then
you
do
care
for
me
any
more
than
you
did
i
love
you
a
thousand
times
more
he
cried
turning
angry
haggard
eyes
to
her
yes
i
believe
i
was
wrong
nothing
would
send
me
from
you
now
but
yourself
she
clapped
her
hands
then
stay
she
said
for
it
a
farce
and
my
money
is
as
safe
as
houses
he
scowled
at
her
it
all
a
trick
you
played
with
me
and
god
forgive
you
he
turned
to
go
but
constance
coming
up
from
behind
them
caught
his
arm
do
be
such
an
idiot
she
said
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
she
thought
her
money
was
gone
you
do
suppose
would
have
played
such
a
trick
even
to
win
valuable
affections
you
deserve
your
luck
mr
dornington
rosamund
was
looking
at
him
with
wet
eyes
and
her
lips
trembled
constance
only
told
me
this
morning
she
said
she
and
stephen
planned
it
to
get
you
to
make
me
to
to
and
then
she
nearly
spoilt
it
all
by
being
as
silly
as
you
were
whatever
does
it
matter
which
of
you
has
the
money
nothing
said
rosamund
valiantly
i
see
that
plainly
do
you
andrew
i
see
nothing
but
you
rosamund
he
said
and
they
turned
and
walked
along
the
hand
in
hand
like
two
children
that
all
right
said
stephen
but
by
jove
i
had
enough
of
playing
providence
and
managing
other
people
affairs
she
was
very
sweet
about
it
said
constance
walking
on
well
she
may
be
she
has
her
heart
desire
but
it
was
not
easy
what
a
blessing
she
is
so
i
could
have
done
it
but
for
you
i
am
very
glad
to
have
been
of
some
service
said
constance
demurely
i
could
have
got
on
without
you
i
ca
get
on
without
you
ever
again
but
that
nonsense
said
miss
grant
you
wo
make
me
constance
there
no
confounded
money
to
come
between
he
caught
at
the
hand
that
swung
by
her
side
but
you
said
you
loved
and
that
was
why
ah
but
that
was
a
thousand
years
ago
and
it
was
nonsense
even
then
constance
and
so
two
others
went
along
the
in
the
october
sunshine
happily
like
children
hand
in
hand
vi
the
hermit
of
the
yews
maurice
brent
knew
a
great
deal
about
the
greek
anthology
and
very
little
about
women
no
one
but
himself
had
any
idea
how
much
he
knew
of
the
one
and
no
one
had
less
idea
than
himself
how
little
he
knew
of
the
other
so
that
when
a
stranger
and
a
pilgrim
hopelessly
astray
amid
a
smart
he
began
to
fall
in
love
with
camilla
it
seemed
to
be
no
one
business
to
tell
him
what
everybody
else
knew
that
camilla
had
contracted
the
habit
of
becoming
engaged
at
least
once
a
year
of
course
this
always
happened
in
the
country
because
it
was
there
that
camilla
was
most
bored
no
other
eligible
young
man
happened
to
be
free
at
the
moment
camilla
never
engaged
herself
to
ineligibles
the
habit
of
years
is
not
easily
broken
camilla
became
engaged
to
maurice
and
for
the
six
months
of
the
engagement
he
lived
in
paradise
a
paradise
if
you
like
but
paradise
all
the
same
about
easter
time
camilla
told
him
very
nicely
and
kindly
that
she
had
mistaken
her
own
heart
she
hoped
he
would
not
let
it
make
him
very
unhappy
she
would
always
wish
him
the
best
of
good
fortune
and
doubtless
he
would
find
it
in
the
affection
of
some
other
girl
much
nicer
and
more
worthy
of
him
than
his
sincere
friend
camilla
camilla
was
right
no
one
could
have
been
less
worthy
of
him
than
she
but
after
all
it
was
camilla
he
thought
that
he
loved
camilla
he
felt
that
he
wanted
not
any
other
girl
at
all
no
matter
how
nice
or
how
worthy
he
took
it
very
quietly
sent
her
a
note
so
cold
and
unconcerned
that
camilla
was
quite
upset
and
cried
most
of
the
evening
and
got
up
next
day
with
swollen
eyelids
and
a
very
bad
temper
she
was
not
so
sure
of
her
power
as
she
had
been
and
the
loss
of
such
a
certainty
is
never
pleasant
he
meanwhile
advertised
for
a
furnished
house
and
found
one
by
letter
which
seemed
to
be
the
very
thing
he
wanted
handsomely
and
conveniently
furnished
five
miles
from
a
railway
station
a
house
standing
in
its
own
grounds
of
five
acres
garden
orchard
pasture
magnificent
view
being
as
unversed
in
the
ways
of
house
agents
as
in
those
of
women
he
took
it
on
trust
paid
a
quarter
rent
and
went
down
to
take
possession
he
had
instructed
the
local
house
agent
to
find
a
woman
who
would
come
in
for
a
few
hours
daily
to
do
for
him
i
have
no
silly
women
living
in
the
house
said
he
it
was
on
an
inclement
june
evening
that
the
station
fly
set
him
down
in
front
of
his
new
house
the
drive
had
been
long
and
dreary
and
seemed
to
maurice
more
like
seventy
miles
than
seven
now
he
let
down
the
carriage
window
and
thrust
his
head
into
the
rain
to
see
his
new
house
it
was
a
stucco
villa
with
iron
railings
in
the
worst
possible
taste
it
had
an
air
at
once
new
and
worn
out
no
one
seemed
ever
to
have
lived
in
it
and
yet
everything
about
it
was
broken
and
shabby
the
door
stuck
a
little
at
first
with
the
damp
and
when
at
last
it
opened
and
maurice
went
over
his
house
he
found
it
furnished
mainly
with
and
tables
and
photographs
in
oxford
frames
like
a
seaside
the
house
was
clean
however
and
the
woman
in
attendance
was
clean
but
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
was
that
of
a
vault
he
looked
out
through
the
streaming
panes
at
the
magnificent
view
so
dwelt
upon
in
the
house
agents
letters
the
house
stood
almost
at
the
edge
of
a
disused
chalk
quarry
far
below
stretched
a
flat
plain
dotted
here
and
there
with
limekilns
and
smoky
tall
chimneys
the
five
acres
looked
very
bare
and
thistly
and
the
rain
was
dripping
heavily
from
a
shivering
cypress
on
to
a
draggled
grass
plot
mr
brent
shivered
too
and
ordered
a
fire
when
the
woman
had
gone
he
sat
long
by
the
fire
in
one
of
those
cane
and
wood
chairs
that
fold
up
who
wants
a
chair
to
fold
up
so
common
in
unless
you
sit
quite
straight
in
these
chairs
you
tumble
out
of
them
he
gazed
at
the
fire
and
thought
and
dreamed
his
dreams
were
naturally
of
camilla
his
thoughts
were
of
his
work
i
taken
the
house
for
three
years
said
he
well
one
place
is
as
good
as
another
to
be
wretched
in
but
one
room
i
must
furnish
for
you
ca
work
on
so
next
day
he
walked
to
rochester
and
bought
some
old
bureaux
and
chairs
and
a
few
persian
rugs
and
some
brass
things
unpacked
his
books
and
settled
down
to
the
hermit
life
to
which
he
had
vowed
himself
the
woman
came
every
morning
from
her
cottage
a
mile
away
and
left
at
noon
he
got
his
meals
himself
always
chops
or
steaks
or
eggs
and
presently
began
to
grow
accustomed
to
the
place
when
the
sun
shone
it
was
not
so
bad
he
could
make
no
way
against
the
thorns
and
thistles
on
his
five
acres
and
they
quickly
grew
into
a
very
wilderness
but
a
wilderness
is
pleasant
to
wander
in
and
a
few
flowers
had
survived
long
neglect
and
here
and
there
put
out
red
or
white
or
yellow
buds
and
he
worked
away
at
his
book
about
greek
poetry
he
almost
believed
that
he
was
contented
he
had
never
cared
for
people
so
much
as
for
books
and
now
he
saw
no
people
and
his
books
began
to
crowd
his
shelves
no
one
passed
by
the
yews
so
called
he
imagined
in
extravagant
compliment
to
the
decaying
cypress
for
it
stood
by
a
that
had
once
connected
two
main
roads
each
a
couple
of
miles
distant
these
were
now
joined
by
a
better
road
down
in
the
valley
and
no
one
came
past
maurice
window
save
the
milk
the
bread
the
butcher
and
the
postman
summer
turned
brown
and
dry
and
became
autumn
autumn
turned
wet
and
chilly
and
grew
into
winter
and
all
the
winds
of
heaven
blew
cold
and
damp
through
the
cracks
of
the
house
maurice
was
glad
when
the
spring
came
he
had
taken
the
house
for
three
years
and
he
was
a
careful
man
and
also
in
his
way
a
determined
yet
it
was
good
to
look
out
once
more
on
something
green
and
to
see
sunshine
and
a
warm
sky
it
was
near
easter
now
in
all
these
ten
months
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
him
he
had
never
been
beyond
his
five
acres
and
no
one
had
been
to
see
him
he
had
no
relations
and
friends
soon
forget
besides
after
all
friends
unlike
relations
can
not
go
where
they
are
not
invited
it
was
on
the
saturday
before
easter
that
the
quarryside
fell
in
maurice
was
working
in
his
study
when
he
heard
a
sudden
crack
and
a
slow
splitting
sound
and
then
a
long
loud
rumbling
noise
like
thunder
that
echoed
and
from
the
hills
on
each
side
and
looking
from
his
window
he
saw
the
cloud
of
white
dust
rise
high
above
the
edge
of
the
old
quarry
and
seem
to
drift
off
to
join
the
clouds
in
the
blue
sky
i
suppose
it
all
safe
enough
here
he
said
and
went
back
to
his
manuscripts
but
he
could
not
work
at
last
something
had
happened
he
found
himself
shaken
and
excited
he
laid
down
the
pen
i
wonder
if
any
one
was
hurt
he
said
the
road
runs
just
below
of
course
i
wonder
whether
there
be
any
more
of
it
i
wonder
a
wire
jerked
the
cracked
bell
sounded
harshly
through
the
silence
of
the
house
he
sprang
to
his
feet
who
on
earth
he
said
the
house
is
safe
after
all
perhaps
and
they
come
to
tell
me
as
he
went
along
the
worn
of
the
hall
he
saw
through
the
comfortless
glass
of
his
front
door
the
outline
of
a
woman
hat
he
opened
the
door
it
stuck
as
usual
but
he
got
it
open
there
stood
a
girl
holding
a
bicycle
oh
she
said
without
looking
at
him
i
so
sorry
to
trouble
you
my
bicycle
run
down
and
i
afraid
it
a
puncture
and
could
you
let
me
have
some
water
to
find
the
hole
and
if
i
might
sit
down
a
minute
her
voice
grew
lower
and
lower
he
opened
the
door
wide
and
put
out
his
hand
for
the
bicycle
she
took
two
steps
past
him
rather
unsteadily
and
sat
down
on
the
stairs
there
were
no
chairs
the
furniture
of
the
hall
was
all
and
hat
pegs
he
saw
now
that
she
was
very
pale
her
face
looked
greenish
behind
her
veil
white
meshes
he
propped
the
machine
against
the
door
as
she
leaned
her
head
back
against
the
ugly
marbled
paper
of
the
staircase
wall
i
afraid
you
ill
he
said
gently
but
the
girl
made
no
answer
her
head
slipped
along
the
varnished
wall
and
rested
on
the
stair
two
steps
above
where
she
sat
her
hat
was
crooked
and
twisted
even
a
student
of
greek
could
see
that
she
had
fainted
oh
lord
said
he
he
got
her
hat
and
veil
off
he
never
knew
how
and
he
wondered
afterwards
at
his
own
cleverness
for
there
were
many
pins
long
and
short
he
fetched
the
cushion
from
his
armchair
and
put
it
under
her
head
he
took
off
her
gloves
and
rubbed
her
hands
and
her
forehead
with
vinegar
but
her
complexion
remained
green
and
she
lay
all
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
his
staircase
then
he
remembered
that
fainting
people
should
be
laid
flat
and
not
allowed
to
lie
about
in
heaps
at
the
foot
of
stairs
so
he
very
gently
and
gingerly
picked
the
girl
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
into
his
here
he
laid
her
on
the
ground
he
had
no
sofa
and
sat
beside
her
on
the
floor
patiently
fanning
her
with
a
copy
of
the
and
watching
the
pinched
pallid
face
for
some
sign
of
returning
life
it
came
at
last
in
a
flutter
of
the
eyelids
a
gasping
breath
the
greek
scholar
rushed
for
whisky
brandy
he
esteemed
as
a
mere
adjunct
of
channel
boats
lifted
her
head
and
held
the
glass
to
her
lips
the
blood
had
come
back
to
her
face
in
a
rush
of
carnation
she
drank
choked
drank
he
laid
her
head
down
and
her
eyes
opened
they
were
large
clear
grey
eyes
very
just
now
but
they
and
the
clear
red
tint
in
cheeks
and
lips
transformed
the
face
good
gracious
said
he
she
pretty
pretty
she
beautiful
she
was
that
such
beauty
should
so
easily
have
hidden
itself
behind
a
mask
with
sunken
eyelid
seemed
a
miracle
to
the
ingenuous
bookworm
you
better
now
said
he
with
feverish
banality
give
me
your
hands
so
now
can
yes
that
right
here
this
chair
is
the
only
comfortable
one
she
sank
into
the
chair
and
waved
away
the
more
whisky
which
he
eagerly
proffered
he
stood
looking
at
her
with
respectful
solicitude
after
a
few
moments
she
stretched
her
arms
like
a
sleepy
child
yawned
and
then
suddenly
broke
into
laughter
it
had
a
strange
sound
no
one
had
laughed
in
that
house
since
the
wet
night
when
mr
brent
took
possession
of
it
and
he
had
never
been
able
to
bring
himself
to
believe
that
any
one
had
ever
laughed
there
before
then
he
remembered
having
heard
that
women
have
hysterical
fits
as
well
as
fainting
fits
and
he
said
eagerly
oh
do
it
all
right
you
were
faint
the
heat
or
something
did
i
faint
she
asked
with
interest
i
never
fainted
before
but
oh
yes
i
remember
it
was
rather
horrible
the
quarry
tumbled
down
almost
on
me
and
i
just
stopped
short
in
time
and
i
came
round
by
this
road
because
the
other
stopped
up
and
i
was
so
glad
when
i
saw
the
house
thank
you
so
much
it
must
have
been
an
awful
bother
i
think
i
had
better
start
soon
no
you
do
you
not
fit
to
ride
alone
yet
said
he
to
himself
aloud
he
said
you
said
something
about
a
puncture
when
you
are
better
i
mend
it
and
look
here
have
you
had
any
lunch
no
said
she
then
if
you
allow
me
he
left
the
room
and
presently
returned
with
the
tray
set
for
his
own
lunch
then
he
fetched
from
the
larder
everything
he
could
lay
hands
on
half
a
cold
chicken
some
cold
meat
pudding
a
pot
of
jam
bottled
beer
he
set
these
confusedly
on
the
table
now
he
said
come
and
try
to
eat
it
very
good
of
you
to
bother
she
said
a
little
surprise
in
her
tone
for
she
had
expected
lunch
to
be
a
set
formal
meal
at
which
some
discreet
female
relative
would
preside
but
are
you
do
you
do
you
live
alone
then
yes
a
woman
comes
in
in
the
mornings
i
sorry
she
gone
she
could
have
arranged
a
better
lunch
for
you
better
why
it
lovely
said
she
accepting
the
situation
with
frank
amusement
and
she
gave
a
touch
or
two
to
the
table
to
set
everything
in
its
place
then
they
lunched
together
he
would
have
served
her
standing
as
one
serves
a
queen
but
she
laughed
again
and
he
took
the
place
opposite
her
during
lunch
they
talked
after
lunch
they
mended
the
punctured
tyre
and
talked
all
the
while
then
it
was
past
three
you
wo
go
yet
he
said
then
daring
greatly
for
what
seemed
to
him
a
great
stake
let
me
make
you
some
tea
i
can
i
assure
you
and
let
us
see
if
the
tyre
holds
up
oh
the
tyre
is
all
right
thanks
to
your
cleverness
well
then
said
he
desperately
take
pity
on
a
poor
hermit
i
give
you
my
word
i
have
been
here
ten
months
and
three
days
and
i
have
not
in
that
time
spoken
a
single
word
to
any
human
being
except
my
bedmaker
but
if
you
want
to
talk
to
people
why
did
you
begin
being
a
hermit
i
thought
i
did
then
well
now
you
know
better
why
do
you
come
back
and
talk
to
people
in
the
ordinary
way
this
was
the
first
and
last
sign
she
gave
that
the
circumstances
in
which
she
found
herself
with
him
were
anything
but
ordinary
i
have
a
book
to
finish
said
he
would
you
like
to
have
tea
in
the
wilderness
or
in
here
he
wisely
took
her
consent
for
granted
this
time
and
his
wisdom
was
justified
they
had
tea
in
the
garden
the
wilderness
blossomed
like
a
rose
to
maurice
thinking
in
his
mind
he
was
saying
over
and
over
again
how
bored
i
must
have
been
all
this
time
how
bored
i
must
have
been
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mind
was
opening
like
a
flower
and
for
the
first
time
he
had
never
talked
so
well
and
he
knew
it
all
the
seeds
of
thought
sown
in
those
long
lonely
hours
bore
fruit
now
she
listened
she
replied
she
argued
and
debated
beautiful
and
sensible
said
maurice
to
himself
what
a
wonderful
woman
there
was
besides
an
alertness
of
mind
a
quick
brightness
of
manner
that
charmed
him
camilla
had
been
languid
and
dreamy
suddenly
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
must
go
she
said
but
i
have
enjoyed
myself
so
much
you
are
an
ideal
host
thank
you
a
thousand
times
perhaps
we
shall
meet
again
some
day
if
you
return
to
the
world
do
you
know
we
been
talking
and
wrangling
for
hours
and
hours
and
never
even
thought
of
wondering
what
each
other
names
are
i
think
we
paid
each
other
a
very
magnificent
compliment
do
you
he
smiled
and
said
my
name
is
maurice
brent
mine
is
diana
redmayne
if
it
sounds
like
somebody
in
the
i
ca
help
it
he
had
wheeled
the
bicycle
into
the
road
and
she
had
put
on
hat
and
gloves
and
stood
ready
to
mount
before
she
said
if
you
come
back
to
the
world
i
shall
almost
certainly
meet
you
we
seem
to
know
the
same
people
i
heard
your
name
many
times
from
whom
said
he
among
others
said
she
with
her
foot
on
the
pedal
from
my
cousin
camilla
and
he
was
left
to
stare
down
the
road
after
the
swift
flying
figure
then
he
went
back
into
the
lonely
little
house
and
about
twelve
that
night
he
realised
that
he
had
done
no
work
that
day
and
that
those
hours
which
had
not
been
spent
talking
to
diana
redmayne
had
been
spent
in
thinking
about
her
it
not
because
she
pretty
and
clever
he
said
and
it
not
even
because
she
a
woman
it
because
she
the
only
intelligent
human
being
i
spoken
to
for
nearly
a
year
so
day
after
day
he
went
on
thinking
about
her
it
was
three
weeks
later
that
the
bell
again
creaked
and
jangled
and
again
through
the
spotted
glass
he
saw
a
woman
hat
to
his
infinite
disgust
and
surprise
his
heart
began
to
beat
violently
i
grow
nervous
living
all
alone
he
said
confound
this
door
how
it
does
stick
i
must
have
it
planed
he
got
the
door
opened
and
found
himself
face
to
face
with
camilla
he
stepped
back
and
bowed
gravely
she
looked
more
beautiful
than
ever
and
he
looked
at
her
and
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
thought
her
even
passably
pretty
wo
you
ask
me
in
she
said
timidly
no
said
he
i
am
all
alone
i
know
she
said
i
have
only
just
heard
you
living
here
all
alone
and
i
came
to
say
maurice
i
sorry
i
did
know
you
cared
so
much
or
do
he
said
stopping
the
confession
as
a
good
batsman
stops
a
cricket
ball
believe
me
i
not
made
myself
a
hermit
because
of
all
that
i
had
a
book
to
write
that
was
all
and
and
it
very
kind
of
you
to
come
and
look
me
up
and
i
wish
i
could
ask
you
to
come
in
but
and
it
nice
of
you
to
take
an
interest
in
an
old
friend
you
said
you
would
did
you
in
the
letter
and
i
taken
the
advice
you
gave
me
you
mean
you
fallen
in
love
with
some
one
else
you
remember
what
you
said
in
your
letter
some
one
nicer
and
worthier
i
said
returned
camilla
blankly
but
i
never
thought
and
is
she
of
course
she
seems
so
to
me
said
he
smiling
at
her
to
express
friendly
feeling
then
i
wish
you
the
best
of
good
fortune
you
said
that
in
your
letter
too
said
he
who
is
she
i
must
tell
even
you
that
until
i
have
told
her
he
smiled
again
then
said
camilla
shortly
forgive
me
for
troubling
you
so
unnecessarily
he
found
himself
standing
by
his
door
and
camilla
on
her
bicycle
sped
down
the
road
choking
with
tears
of
anger
and
mortification
and
deep
disappointment
because
she
knew
now
that
she
loved
him
as
much
as
it
was
in
her
to
love
any
one
and
because
she
who
had
humbled
so
many
had
now
at
last
humbled
herself
and
to
no
purpose
maurice
brent
left
his
door
open
and
wandered
down
across
his
five
acres
filled
with
amazement
camilla
herself
had
not
been
more
deeply
astonished
at
the
words
he
had
spoken
than
he
had
been
a
moment
before
he
had
not
even
thought
that
he
was
in
love
much
less
contemplated
any
confession
of
it
and
now
seemingly
without
his
will
he
stood
committed
to
this
statement
was
it
true
or
had
he
only
said
it
to
defend
himself
against
those
advances
of
hers
in
which
he
merely
saw
a
new
trap
he
had
said
it
in
defence
yes
but
it
was
true
for
all
that
this
was
the
wonderful
part
of
it
and
so
he
walked
in
the
wilderness
lost
in
wonder
and
as
he
walked
he
noted
the
bicycles
that
passed
his
door
along
his
unfrequented
road
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
for
this
was
a
saturday
and
the
lower
road
was
still
lying
cold
and
hidden
under
its
load
of
chalk
and
none
might
pass
that
way
this
road
was
hot
and
dusty
and
folk
went
along
it
continually
he
strolled
to
his
ugly
iron
gate
and
looked
over
idly
perhaps
some
day
she
would
come
that
way
again
she
would
surely
stop
especially
if
he
were
at
the
gate
and
perhaps
stay
and
talk
a
little
as
if
in
mocking
answer
to
the
thought
came
a
flash
of
blue
along
the
road
diana
redmayne
rode
by
at
full
speed
bowed
coldly
and
then
at
ten
yards
distance
turned
and
waved
a
hand
with
a
charming
smile
maurice
swore
softly
and
went
indoors
to
think
his
work
went
but
slowly
on
that
day
and
in
the
days
that
followed
on
the
next
friday
he
went
over
to
rochester
and
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
he
walked
along
the
road
about
a
mile
from
the
yews
and
then
going
slowly
he
cast
handfuls
of
something
dark
from
his
hand
and
kicked
the
white
dust
over
it
as
it
lay
i
feel
like
the
enemy
sowing
tares
said
he
then
he
went
home
full
of
anxious
anticipation
the
next
day
was
hot
and
bright
he
took
his
armchair
into
the
nightmare
of
a
verandah
and
sat
there
reading
only
above
the
top
of
the
book
his
eyes
could
follow
the
curve
of
the
white
road
this
made
it
more
difficult
to
follow
the
text
presently
the
bicyclists
began
to
go
past
by
ones
and
twos
and
threes
but
a
certain
percentage
was
wheeling
its
machines
others
stopped
within
sight
to
blow
up
their
tyres
one
man
sat
down
under
the
hedge
thirty
yards
away
and
took
his
machine
to
pieces
presently
he
strolled
up
and
asked
for
water
brent
gave
it
in
a
tin
basin
grudgingly
and
without
opening
the
gate
i
overdid
it
he
said
a
quarter
of
a
pound
would
have
been
enough
yet
i
do
know
perhaps
it
well
to
be
on
the
safe
side
yet
three
pounds
was
perhaps
excessive
late
in
the
afternoon
a
pink
figure
wheeling
a
bicycle
came
slowly
down
the
road
he
sat
still
and
tried
to
read
in
a
moment
he
should
hear
the
click
of
the
gate
then
he
would
spring
up
and
be
very
much
astonished
but
the
gate
did
not
click
and
when
next
he
raised
his
eyes
the
pink
blouse
had
gone
by
and
was
almost
past
the
end
of
the
five
acres
then
he
did
spring
up
and
ran
miss
redmayne
ca
i
help
you
what
is
it
have
you
had
a
spill
he
said
as
he
overtook
her
puncture
said
she
laconically
you
very
unfortunate
may
i
help
you
to
mend
it
i
mend
it
as
soon
as
i
get
to
a
shady
place
come
into
the
wilderness
see
here
the
side
gate
i
fetch
some
water
in
a
moment
she
looked
at
him
doubtfully
and
then
consented
she
refused
tea
but
she
stayed
and
talked
till
long
after
the
bicycle
was
mended
on
the
following
saturday
he
walked
along
the
road
and
back
and
along
and
again
the
place
was
alive
with
angry
cyclists
dealing
each
after
his
fashion
with
a
punctured
tyre
he
came
upon
miss
redmayne
sitting
by
the
ditch
mending
hers
that
was
the
time
when
he
sat
on
the
roadside
and
told
her
all
about
himself
reserving
only
those
points
where
his
life
had
touched
camilla
the
week
after
he
walked
the
road
again
and
this
time
he
overtook
miss
redmayne
who
was
resolutely
wheeling
her
bicycle
back
in
the
way
by
which
she
had
come
let
me
wheel
it
for
you
he
said
whither
bound
i
going
back
to
rochester
she
said
i
generally
ride
over
to
see
my
aunts
at
felsenden
on
saturdays
but
i
fear
i
must
give
it
up
or
go
by
train
this
road
is
safe
not
safe
he
said
with
an
agitation
which
could
not
escape
her
notice
not
safe
she
repeated
mr
brent
there
is
a
very
malicious
person
in
this
part
of
the
country
a
perfectly
dreadful
person
what
do
you
mean
he
managed
to
ask
these
three
saturdays
i
have
come
along
this
road
each
time
i
have
had
a
puncture
and
each
time
i
have
found
embedded
in
my
tyre
the
evidence
of
some
one
malice
this
is
one
piece
of
evidence
she
held
out
her
ungloved
hand
on
its
pink
palm
lay
a
good
sized
once
might
be
accident
twice
a
coincidence
three
times
is
too
much
the
impossible
do
you
think
some
one
did
it
on
purpose
i
know
it
she
said
calmly
then
he
grew
desperate
try
to
forgive
me
he
said
i
was
so
lonely
and
i
wanted
so
much
she
turned
wide
eyes
on
him
you
she
cried
and
began
to
laugh
her
laughter
was
very
pretty
he
thought
then
you
did
know
it
was
me
said
the
greek
student
you
she
said
again
and
has
it
amused
you
to
see
all
these
poor
people
in
difficulties
and
to
know
that
you
spoilt
their
poor
little
holiday
for
them
and
three
times
too
i
never
thought
about
he
said
it
was
you
i
wanted
to
see
try
to
forgive
me
you
do
know
how
much
i
wanted
you
something
in
his
voice
kept
her
silent
and
do
laugh
he
went
on
i
feel
as
if
i
wanted
nothing
in
the
world
but
you
let
me
come
to
see
you
let
me
try
to
make
you
care
too
you
talking
nonsense
she
said
for
he
stopped
on
a
note
that
demanded
an
answer
why
you
told
camilla
yes
but
you
but
i
meant
i
thought
i
cared
about
her
once
but
i
never
cared
really
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
for
any
one
but
you
she
looked
at
him
calmly
and
earnestly
i
going
to
forget
all
this
she
said
but
i
like
you
very
much
and
if
you
want
to
come
and
see
me
you
may
i
will
introduce
you
to
my
aunts
at
felsenden
as
as
a
friend
of
camilla
and
i
will
be
friends
with
you
but
nothing
else
ever
do
you
care
to
know
my
aunts
maurice
had
inspirations
of
sense
sometimes
one
came
to
him
now
and
he
said
i
care
very
much
then
help
me
to
mend
my
bicycle
and
you
can
call
there
grange
you
ca
miss
it
no
not
another
word
of
nonsense
please
or
we
ca
possibly
be
friends
he
helped
her
to
mend
the
bicycle
and
they
talked
of
the
beauty
of
spring
and
of
modern
poetry
it
was
at
the
grange
felsenden
that
maurice
next
saw
miss
redmayne
and
it
was
from
the
grange
felsenden
that
in
september
he
married
her
and
why
did
you
say
you
would
never
never
be
anything
but
a
friend
he
asked
her
on
the
day
when
that
marriage
was
arranged
oh
you
nearly
made
me
believe
you
why
did
you
say
it
one
must
say
something
she
answered
besides
you
never
have
respected
me
if
i
said
at
once
could
you
have
said
it
did
you
like
me
then
she
looked
at
him
and
her
look
was
an
answer
he
stooped
and
gravely
kissed
her
and
you
really
cared
even
then
i
wish
you
had
been
braver
he
said
a
little
sadly
ah
but
she
said
i
did
know
you
then
you
must
try
to
forgive
me
dear
think
how
much
there
was
at
stake
suppose
i
had
lost
you
vii
the
aunt
and
the
editor
aunt
kate
was
the
great
comfort
of
kitty
existence
always
kindly
helpful
sympathetic
no
girlish
trouble
was
too
slight
no
girlish
question
too
difficult
for
her
tender
heart
her
delicate
insight
how
different
from
grim
aunt
eliza
with
whom
it
was
kitty
fate
to
live
aunt
eliza
was
severe
methodical
energetic
in
household
matters
she
spared
neither
herself
nor
her
niece
kitty
could
darn
and
mend
and
bake
and
dust
and
sweep
in
a
way
which
might
have
turned
the
parents
of
the
bluest
girtonian
green
with
envy
she
had
read
a
great
deal
too
the
really
solid
works
that
are
such
a
nuisance
to
get
through
and
that
leave
a
mark
on
one
mind
like
the
track
of
a
steamroller
that
was
aunt
eliza
doing
kitty
ought
to
have
been
grateful
but
she
was
she
did
want
to
be
improved
with
solid
books
she
wanted
to
write
books
herself
she
did
write
little
tales
when
her
aunt
was
out
on
business
which
was
often
and
she
dreamed
of
the
day
when
she
should
write
beautiful
books
poems
romances
these
aunt
eliza
classed
roughly
as
stuff
and
nonsense
and
one
day
when
she
found
kitty
reading
the
very
own
she
tore
that
harmless
little
weekly
across
and
across
and
flung
it
into
the
fire
then
she
faced
kitty
with
flushed
face
and
angry
eyes
if
i
ever
catch
you
bringing
such
rubbish
into
the
house
again
i
i
stop
your
music
lessons
this
was
a
horrible
threat
kitty
went
twice
a
week
to
the
guildhall
school
of
music
she
had
no
musical
talent
whatever
but
the
journey
to
london
and
back
was
her
one
glimpse
of
the
world
tide
that
flowed
outside
the
neat
gloomy
ordered
house
at
streatham
therefore
kitty
was
careful
that
aunt
eliza
should
not
again
catch
her
bringing
such
rubbish
into
the
house
but
she
went
on
reading
the
paper
all
the
same
just
as
she
went
on
writing
her
little
stories
and
presently
she
got
one
of
her
little
stories
typewritten
and
sent
it
to
the
very
own
it
was
a
silly
little
story
the
heroine
was
i
am
sorry
to
say
and
had
hair
and
a
soft
voice
and
the
hero
was
a
young
englishman
with
a
bronzed
face
and
honest
blue
eyes
the
plot
was
that
with
which
i
firmly
believe
every
career
of
fiction
begins
the
girl
who
throws
over
her
lover
because
he
has
jilted
her
friend
then
she
finds
out
that
it
was
not
her
lover
but
his
brother
or
cousin
we
have
all
written
this
story
in
our
time
and
kitty
wrote
it
much
worse
than
many
but
not
nearly
so
badly
as
most
of
us
and
the
very
own
accepted
the
story
and
printed
it
and
in
its
columns
notified
to
george
thompson
that
the
price
a
whole
guinea
was
lying
idle
at
the
office
till
he
should
send
his
address
for
of
course
kitty
had
taken
a
man
name
for
her
and
almost
equally
of
course
had
called
herself
george
george
sand
began
it
and
it
is
a
fashion
which
young
authors
seem
quite
unable
to
keep
themselves
from
following
kitty
longed
to
tell
some
one
of
her
success
to
ask
admiration
and
advice
but
aunt
eliza
was
more
severe
and
less
approachable
than
usual
that
week
she
was
busy
writing
letters
she
had
always
a
sheaf
of
letters
to
answer
so
kitty
could
only
tell
mary
in
the
kitchen
under
vows
of
secrecy
and
mary
in
the
kitchen
only
said
well
to
be
sure
miss
it
beautiful
i
suppose
you
wrote
the
story
down
out
of
some
book
therefore
kitty
felt
that
it
was
vain
to
apply
to
her
for
intellectual
sympathy
i
will
write
to
aunt
kate
said
she
will
understand
oh
how
i
wish
i
could
see
her
she
must
be
a
dear
soft
pussy
cuddly
sort
of
person
why
should
i
go
and
see
her
i
will
and
on
this
desperate
resolve
she
acted
now
i
find
it
quite
impossible
any
longer
to
conceal
from
the
intelligent
reader
that
the
reason
why
kitty
had
never
seen
aunt
kate
was
that
aunt
kate
was
merely
the
screen
which
sheltered
from
a
vulgar
publicity
the
gifted
person
who
wrote
the
answers
to
correspondents
for
the
very
own
in
fear
and
trembling
and
a
disguised
handwriting
with
a
feigned
name
and
a
heart
kitty
months
before
had
written
to
this
mysterious
and
gracious
being
in
the
following
week
number
had
appeared
these
memorable
lines
so
pleased
dear
with
your
little
letter
write
to
me
quite
freely
i
love
to
help
my
girls
so
kitty
wrote
quite
freely
and
as
honestly
as
any
girl
of
eighteen
ever
writes
her
hopes
and
fears
her
household
troubles
her
literary
ambitions
and
in
the
columns
of
the
very
own
aunt
kate
replied
with
all
the
tender
grace
and
delightful
warmth
that
characterised
her
utterances
the
idea
of
calling
on
aunt
kate
occurred
to
kitty
as
she
was
putting
on
her
things
to
go
to
the
guildhall
she
instantly
threw
the
plain
everyday
hat
from
her
and
pulled
her
best
hat
from
its
nest
in
the
black
bandbox
she
put
on
her
best
blouse
the
one
with
the
browny
lace
on
it
and
her
best
brown
silk
skirt
she
recklessly
added
her
best
brown
shoes
and
gloves
and
the
lace
i
do
know
what
the
milliner
name
for
the
thing
is
it
goes
round
the
neck
and
hangs
its
soft
and
fluffy
ends
down
nearly
to
one
knees
then
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
glass
gave
a
few
last
touches
to
her
hair
and
veil
and
nodded
to
herself
you
do
my
dear
said
kitty
aunt
eliza
was
providentially
absent
at
bath
nursing
a
sick
friend
and
the
duenna
hastily
imported
from
tunbridge
wells
could
not
be
expected
to
know
which
was
kitty
best
frock
and
which
the
gloves
that
ought
only
to
have
been
worn
at
church
when
kitty
music
lesson
was
over
she
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
steps
of
the
guildhall
school
looking
down
towards
the
river
then
she
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
i
do
care
i
going
to
she
said
and
turned
resolutely
towards
tudor
street
kitty
had
been
to
a
high
school
therefore
she
was
not
obviously
shy
she
asked
her
way
frankly
and
easily
of
carman
or
clerk
or
and
though
at
the
door
of
the
dingy
office
in
a
little
court
off
fleet
street
her
heart
beat
thickly
as
she
read
the
words
very
own
her
manner
as
she
walked
into
the
office
betrayed
no
nervousness
and
indeed
struck
the
grinning
idle
office
boy
as
that
of
a
bloomin
duchess
i
want
to
see
she
began
and
then
suddenly
the
awkwardness
of
her
position
struck
her
she
did
not
know
aunt
kate
surname
abruptly
to
ask
this
grinning
lout
for
aunt
kate
seemed
absolutely
indecorous
i
want
to
see
the
editor
she
ended
she
waited
in
the
grimy
office
while
the
boy
disappeared
through
an
inner
door
marked
in
dingy
white
letters
with
the
magic
words
editor
private
a
low
buzz
of
voices
came
to
her
through
the
door
she
looked
at
the
where
heaps
of
back
numbers
of
the
very
lay
in
a
dusty
retirement
she
looked
at
the
insurance
company
tasteless
almanack
that
hung
all
awry
on
the
wall
and
still
the
buzz
went
on
then
suddenly
some
one
laughed
inside
and
the
laugh
did
not
please
kitty
the
next
moment
the
boy
returned
grinning
more
repulsively
than
ever
and
said
walk
this
way
she
walked
that
way
past
the
boy
the
door
fell
to
behind
her
and
she
found
herself
in
a
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
compressed
into
a
small
room
a
very
dusty
untidy
room
in
which
stood
three
young
men
their
faces
were
grave
and
serious
but
kate
could
not
forget
that
one
of
them
had
laughed
and
laughed
her
chin
went
up
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
further
i
am
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
she
said
severely
i
wanted
to
see
to
see
the
lady
who
signs
herself
aunt
kate
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
which
seemed
almost
breathless
two
of
the
young
men
exchanged
a
glance
but
though
kitty
perceived
it
to
be
significant
she
could
not
interpret
its
meaning
then
one
of
the
three
turned
to
gaze
out
of
the
window
at
the
blackened
glass
roof
of
the
printing
office
below
kitty
felt
certain
he
was
concealing
a
smile
and
the
second
hurriedly
arranged
a
bundle
of
papers
beside
him
the
third
young
man
spoke
and
kitty
liked
the
gentle
drawl
the
peculiar
enunciation
the
poor
girl
in
her
streatham
seclusion
had
never
before
heard
the
oxford
voice
i
am
very
sorry
he
said
but
kate
is
not
here
perhaps
is
there
anything
i
could
do
no
thank
you
said
kitty
wishing
herself
miles
away
the
tobacco
smoke
choked
her
the
backs
of
the
two
other
men
seemed
an
outrage
she
turned
away
with
a
haughty
bow
and
went
down
the
grimy
stairs
full
of
fury
she
could
have
slapped
herself
how
could
she
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
come
there
there
were
feet
coming
down
the
stair
behind
her
she
quickened
her
pace
the
feet
came
more
quickly
she
stopped
on
the
landing
and
turned
with
an
odd
feeling
of
being
at
bay
it
was
the
young
man
with
the
oxford
voice
i
am
so
very
sorry
he
said
gently
but
i
did
not
know
i
did
not
expect
to
see
i
mean
i
did
not
know
who
you
were
and
we
had
all
been
smoking
i
am
so
sorry
he
said
again
rather
lamely
it
does
matter
said
kitty
more
shyly
than
she
had
ever
spoken
in
her
life
she
liked
his
eyes
and
his
voice
as
much
as
she
loathed
the
expressive
backs
of
his
two
companions
if
you
could
come
again
perhaps
aunt
kate
will
be
here
on
thursday
i
know
she
will
be
sorry
to
miss
you
the
young
man
went
on
i
think
i
wo
call
again
thank
you
said
kitty
i
i
write
thank
you
it
is
all
right
i
ought
to
have
come
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
stand
back
and
let
her
pass
the
editor
went
back
slowly
to
his
room
his
friends
had
relighted
their
pipes
appeased
the
outraged
goddess
asked
one
of
them
good
old
aunt
kate
said
the
other
shut
up
sellars
said
the
editor
frowning
now
which
of
your
correspondents
is
it
pondered
sellars
ruffling
the
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hand
is
it
woodbine
who
wants
to
know
what
will
make
her
hands
white
chilcott
did
you
see
her
hands
oh
no
of
course
chaussée
bien
all
brown
too
is
it
no
she
wants
a
pattern
for
a
zouave
what
is
a
zouave
if
you
please
mr
editor
dry
up
said
the
editor
but
sellars
was
busy
with
the
papers
eureka
i
know
her
she
maid
here
the
letter
wants
to
know
if
she
may
talk
to
young
gentleman
she
has
not
been
properly
introduced
to
spells
it
too
the
editor
snatched
the
papers
out
of
the
other
hands
now
clear
out
said
he
i
busy
am
i
dreaming
said
sellars
pensively
or
is
this
the
editor
who
invited
us
to
collaborate
with
him
in
his
to
correspondents
i
am
the
editor
who
will
kick
you
down
the
entire
five
flights
if
he
is
driven
to
it
you
wo
drive
him
will
you
the
two
laughed
but
they
took
up
their
hats
and
went
sellars
put
his
head
round
the
door
for
a
last
word
what
price
love
at
first
sight
said
he
and
the
office
ruler
dented
the
door
as
he
disappeared
round
it
the
editor
left
alone
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
looked
helplessly
round
him
well
he
said
musingly
well
well
well
well
then
after
a
long
silence
he
took
up
his
pen
and
began
the
answers
to
correspondents
your
hair
is
a
very
nice
colour
i
should
not
advise
aureoline
by
all
means
consult
your
mother
heliotrope
would
suit
your
complexion
if
it
is
as
you
say
of
a
brilliant
fairness
no
i
should
not
advise
scarlet
velvet
with
the
pale
blue
try
myrtle
green
presently
he
threw
down
the
pen
i
suppose
i
shall
never
see
her
again
he
said
and
he
actually
sighed
but
he
did
see
her
again
for
on
her
way
home
poor
kitty
imagination
suddenly
spread
its
wings
and
alighted
accurately
on
the
truth
she
formed
a
sufficiently
vivid
picture
of
what
had
happened
in
the
office
after
she
left
she
that
those
other
young
men
the
pigs
she
called
them
to
herself
had
speculated
as
to
whether
she
was
little
one
who
wanted
to
make
her
hair
curl
and
to
know
whether
short
waists
would
be
worn
or
moss
rose
who
was
anxious
about
her
complexion
and
the
proper
way
to
treat
a
jibbing
sweetheart
so
that
very
night
she
wrote
a
note
to
aunt
kate
but
she
did
not
sign
it
sweet
nancy
in
the
old
manner
and
she
did
not
disguise
her
hand
she
signed
it
george
thompson
in
inverted
commas
and
she
said
that
she
would
call
on
thursday
and
on
thursday
she
called
and
was
shown
into
the
editor
room
at
once
the
editor
rose
to
greet
her
aunt
kate
is
not
here
said
he
hurriedly
but
if
you
can
spare
a
few
moments
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
business
i
did
not
know
the
other
day
that
you
were
the
author
of
that
charming
story
error
the
room
was
clear
of
tobacco
smoke
the
editor
was
alone
some
red
roses
lay
on
the
table
kitty
caught
herself
wondering
for
whom
he
had
bought
them
the
chair
he
offered
her
was
carefully
dusted
she
took
it
and
he
began
to
talk
about
her
story
criticising
praising
blaming
and
that
so
skilfully
that
criticism
seemed
a
subtle
flattery
and
the
very
blame
conveyed
a
compliment
then
he
asked
for
more
stories
and
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
seemed
to
unroll
before
the
girl
eyes
if
she
could
only
write
and
succeed
and
will
you
come
again
he
said
at
last
aunt
kate
oh
she
said
with
eyes
shining
softly
it
does
matter
about
aunt
kate
now
i
shall
be
so
busy
trying
to
write
stories
the
fact
is
said
the
editor
slowly
racking
his
brains
for
a
reason
that
should
bring
her
to
the
office
again
the
fact
is
am
aunt
kate
kitty
sprang
to
her
feet
her
face
flamed
scarlet
she
stood
silent
a
moment
then
she
cried
oh
it
fair
it
mean
shameful
oh
how
could
you
and
girls
write
to
and
they
think
it
a
woman
and
they
tell
you
about
their
troubles
it
horrible
it
underhand
it
abominable
i
hate
you
for
it
every
one
ought
to
know
i
shall
write
to
the
papers
please
please
said
the
editor
hurriedly
and
humbly
it
not
my
fault
it
a
lady
who
does
it
generally
but
she
had
to
go
away
and
i
could
get
any
one
else
to
do
it
and
i
did
see
till
after
been
the
other
day
that
it
was
fair
and
i
was
going
to
ask
if
would
do
it
the
correspondence
i
mean
just
for
this
week
i
wish
you
would
could
i
she
said
doubtfully
of
course
you
could
and
if
you
bring
the
copy
on
monday
about
two
columns
you
know
we
could
go
through
it
together
and
well
i
try
said
kitty
abruptly
reaching
out
for
the
sheaf
of
letters
which
he
was
gathering
together
and
now
who
was
happier
than
kitty
seated
behind
her
locked
bedroom
door
advising
and
shy
fairy
and
contadina
out
of
the
unfathomable
depths
of
her
girlish
inexperience
her
advice
looked
wonderfully
practical
though
in
print
she
thought
as
with
a
thrill
of
pride
and
joy
she
corrected
the
first
proofs
and
she
wrote
stories
too
and
they
too
were
printed
it
was
indeed
a
bright
and
beautiful
world
aunt
eliza
stayed
away
for
five
glorious
weeks
kitty
with
an
enthralling
sense
of
reckless
wickedness
gave
up
her
useless
music
lessons
and
in
going
three
times
a
week
to
the
office
experienced
a
glowing
consciousness
of
the
joy
and
dignity
of
honest
toil
the
editor
by
the
way
during
these
five
weeks
fell
in
love
with
kitty
exactly
as
he
had
known
he
would
do
when
first
he
saw
her
grey
eyes
kitty
had
never
been
so
happy
in
all
her
life
the
child
honestly
believed
hers
to
be
the
happiness
that
comes
from
congenial
work
and
her
editor
was
so
clever
and
so
kind
no
one
ever
smoked
in
the
office
now
and
there
were
always
roses
and
kitty
took
them
home
with
her
so
that
now
there
was
no
need
to
wonder
for
whom
he
had
bought
them
then
came
the
inevitable
hour
he
met
her
one
day
with
a
clouded
face
and
a
letter
in
his
hand
it
all
over
he
said
the
real
original
old
aunt
kate
is
coming
back
she
the
dearest
old
thing
so
kind
and
jolly
but
but
but
whatever
shall
we
do
i
can
still
write
stories
i
suppose
said
kitty
but
she
realised
with
a
gasp
that
congenial
toil
would
not
be
quite
quite
the
same
without
congenial
companionship
yes
said
he
picking
up
the
bunch
of
red
roses
but
here
are
your
flowers
do
you
know
yet
that
i
ca
possibly
do
without
you
in
a
few
months
i
to
have
the
editorship
of
a
new
weekly
a
much
better
berth
than
this
if
only
you
would
write
the
correspondence
said
kitty
brightening
of
course
i
will
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
i
wish
he
interrupted
that
i
could
think
it
was
you
do
without
her
pretty
eyes
met
his
over
the
red
roses
and
he
caught
her
hands
with
the
flowers
in
them
is
it
oh
say
you
ca
do
without
me
either
say
it
say
it
i
i
do
want
to
do
without
you
said
kitty
at
last
he
was
holding
her
hands
fast
and
she
was
trying
not
very
earnestly
perhaps
to
pull
them
away
the
pair
made
a
pretty
picture
oh
kitty
kitty
kitty
he
said
softly
and
then
the
door
opened
and
suddenly
without
the
least
warning
a
lady
became
a
spectator
of
the
little
tableau
the
newcomer
wore
a
mantle
with
beads
on
it
a
black
bonnet
wherein
nodded
a
violet
flower
and
beads
and
flower
and
bonnet
were
absolutely
familiar
to
each
of
the
astonished
ones
now
standing
consciously
with
the
breadth
of
the
office
between
them
for
in
that
lady
the
editor
recognised
aunt
kate
the
pleasant
sensible
companionable
woman
who
for
years
had
written
those
sympathetic
answers
to
correspondents
in
the
very
own
and
at
the
same
moment
kitty
recognised
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
aunt
eliza
her
own
grim
harsh
uncongenial
aunt
eliza
kitty
cowered
in
her
frightened
soul
she
cowered
but
her
little
figure
drew
itself
up
and
the
point
of
her
chin
rose
a
quarter
of
an
inch
aunt
eliza
she
said
firmly
i
know
you
will
aunt
kitty
cried
the
editor
said
the
aunt
and
now
the
situation
hung
all
too
nicely
balanced
on
the
extreme
edge
of
the
absolutely
impossible
would
this
lady
an
aunt
beyond
doubt
an
aunt
who
so
long
had
played
a
double
assume
now
that
one
must
be
chosen
the
part
of
aunt
eliza
the
terrible
or
of
aunt
kate
the
kind
the
aunt
was
dumb
kitty
was
dumb
but
the
editor
had
his
wits
about
him
and
kate
though
shaken
was
not
absolutely
paralysed
it
almost
too
good
to
be
true
he
said
that
aunt
kate
is
really
aunt
eliza
aunt
kate
kitty
and
i
have
just
decided
that
we
ca
do
without
each
other
i
am
so
glad
that
you
are
the
first
to
wish
us
joy
at
his
words
all
the
kate
in
the
aunt
rose
triumphant
trampling
down
the
eliza
my
dear
boy
she
said
and
she
said
it
in
a
voice
which
kitty
had
never
heard
before
the
sound
of
that
voice
drew
kitty
like
a
magnet
she
did
the
only
possible
thing
she
put
her
arms
timidly
round
her
aunt
neck
and
whispered
oh
do
be
aunt
eliza
any
more
be
aunt
kate
it
was
aunt
kate
arms
undoubtedly
that
went
round
the
girl
certainly
not
aunt
eliza
i
will
take
a
walk
down
fleet
street
said
the
editor
discreetly
then
there
were
explanations
in
the
office
but
why
said
kitty
when
all
the
questions
had
been
asked
and
answered
why
were
you
aunt
eliza
to
me
and
aunt
kate
to
him
my
dear
one
must
spoil
somebody
and
i
was
determined
not
to
spoil
i
wanted
to
save
you
all
my
life
was
ruined
because
i
was
a
spoiled
child
and
because
i
tried
to
write
i
had
such
dreams
such
ambitions
just
like
yours
you
silly
child
but
then
i
was
never
clever
perhaps
you
may
be
and
it
all
ended
in
my
losing
my
lover
he
married
a
nice
quiet
domestic
girl
and
i
never
made
name
or
fame
at
all
i
never
got
anything
taken
but
fashion
articles
and
to
correspondents
now
that
the
whole
tale
do
mention
it
again
but
you
did
love
me
even
when
of
course
i
did
said
aunt
kate
in
the
testy
tones
of
aunt
eliza
or
why
should
i
have
bothered
at
all
about
whether
you
were
going
to
be
happy
or
not
now
kitty
you
not
to
expect
me
to
gush
forgotten
how
to
be
sentimental
except
on
paper
i
do
want
to
be
sentimental
said
kitty
a
little
injured
neither
does
here
the
editor
came
in
you
do
want
to
be
sentimental
either
kitty
went
on
do
you
mr
editor
the
editor
looked
a
little
doubtful
i
want
to
be
happy
at
any
rate
said
he
and
i
mean
to
be
and
he
ca
be
happy
unless
you
smile
on
him
smile
on
him
auntie
cried
a
new
radiant
kitty
to
whom
aunts
no
longer
presented
any
terrors
say
you
my
children
auntie
do
get
along
with
your
nonsense
said
aunt
eliza
or
was
it
aunt
kate
viii
miss
mouse
they
were
poor
not
with
the
desperate
poverty
that
has
to
look
on
both
sides
of
a
penny
but
with
the
decent
bearable
poverty
that
must
look
at
a
shilling
with
attention
and
with
respect
at
there
was
money
for
the
necessities
of
life
the
mother
said
but
no
money
to
waste
this
was
what
she
always
tried
to
say
when
maisie
came
in
with
rainbow
representations
of
the
glories
of
local
sales
piteous
pictures
of
beautiful
things
going
almost
for
nothing
things
not
absolutely
needed
but
which
would
come
in
useful
maisie
dress
was
never
allowed
those
touches
of
cheap
finery
which
would
have
made
it
characteristic
of
her
her
clothes
were
good
and
she
had
to
patch
and
mend
and
contrive
so
much
that
sometimes
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
all
her
life
was
going
by
in
the
effort
to
achieve
by
a
distasteful
process
a
result
which
she
abhorred
for
her
artistic
sense
was
too
weak
to
show
her
how
the
bright
soft
freshness
of
her
tints
gained
by
contrast
with
the
dull
greys
and
browns
and
drabs
that
were
her
choice
good
wearing
colours
from
which
the
pink
and
white
of
her
face
rose
triumphantly
like
a
beautiful
flower
out
of
a
rough
calyx
the
house
was
like
maisie
in
that
it
never
seemed
to
have
anything
new
none
of
those
bright
picturesque
cushions
and
screens
and
japaneseries
which
she
adored
through
the
windows
of
the
big
local
draper
the
curtains
were
of
old
damask
faded
but
rich
the
furniture
was
mahogany
old
and
solid
the
carpets
were
turkey
and
aubusson
patched
and
darned
this
last
but
still
beautiful
maisie
knew
all
about
old
oak
she
had
read
her
and
her
but
she
had
no
idea
that
mahogany
could
be
fashionable
none
of
the
photographs
of
the
of
celebrities
in
her
favourite
papers
were
anything
like
the
little
where
her
mother
sat
knitting
by
the
hearth
surrounded
by
the
relics
of
a
house
that
had
been
handsome
in
the
when
it
was
her
girlhood
home
maisie
hated
it
all
the
chairs
covered
in
needlework
the
dark
polished
surfaces
of
the
tables
and
bureaux
the
tinkling
lustres
of
bohemian
glass
the
shining
brass
trivet
on
which
the
toast
kept
itself
warm
the
crude
colours
of
the
the
smell
of
mingling
with
the
faint
scent
of
beeswax
and
she
would
have
liked
to
change
the
old
in
their
rubbed
gilt
frames
for
autotypes
how
should
she
know
that
those
hideous
pigs
were
morlands
and
that
the
cow
picture
was
a
david
cox
she
would
have
liked
japanese
blue
transfers
instead
of
the
china
old
bristol
by
the
way
but
maisie
knew
nothing
of
bristol
the
regular
sober
orderliness
of
the
house
chafed
and
fretted
her
the
recurrent
duties
all
dull
the
few
guests
who
came
to
tea
decent
poverty
can
not
give
dinner
parties
or
dances
she
visited
her
school
friends
and
when
she
came
home
again
it
seemed
to
her
sometimes
as
though
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
would
choke
her
i
want
to
go
out
and
earn
my
own
living
she
said
to
her
cousin
edward
one
sunday
afternoon
when
her
mother
was
resting
and
he
and
she
were
roasting
chestnuts
on
the
bars
of
the
fire
i
simply
useless
here
edward
was
a
second
cousin
to
him
the
little
house
was
the
ideal
home
just
as
maisie
was
well
not
perhaps
the
ideal
girl
but
the
only
girl
in
the
world
which
comes
to
much
the
same
thing
but
he
never
told
her
so
he
dared
not
risk
losing
the
cousin
place
and
missing
for
ever
the
lover
so
in
his
anxiety
lest
she
should
know
how
much
he
cared
he
scolded
her
a
good
deal
but
he
took
her
to
picture
galleries
and
to
and
softened
her
life
in
a
hundred
ways
that
she
never
noticed
he
was
only
poor
old
edward
and
he
knew
it
how
can
you
he
said
why
what
on
earth
would
aunt
do
without
you
here
have
this
one
it
a
beauty
i
ought
to
have
been
taught
a
trade
like
other
poor
girls
she
went
on
waving
away
the
roasted
chestnut
lots
of
the
girls
i
was
at
school
with
are
earning
as
much
as
a
pound
a
week
now
typewriting
or
painting
birthday
cards
and
some
of
them
are
in
the
post
office
and
i
do
nothing
but
drudge
away
at
home
it
too
bad
edward
would
have
given
a
decent
sum
at
that
moment
to
be
inspired
with
exactly
the
right
thing
to
say
as
it
was
he
looked
at
her
helplessly
i
do
understand
i
afraid
said
he
you
never
do
she
answered
crossly
there
was
a
silence
in
which
she
felt
the
growth
of
a
need
to
justify
herself
to
herself
as
well
as
to
him
why
do
you
see
she
urged
it
my
plain
duty
to
go
out
and
earn
something
why
we
as
poor
as
ever
we
can
be
i
have
any
hardly
i
ca
even
buy
presents
for
people
i
have
to
presents
out
of
odds
and
ends
of
old
things
instead
of
buying
them
like
other
girls
i
think
you
make
awfully
pretty
things
he
said
much
prettier
than
any
one
can
buy
you
thinking
of
that
i
gave
aunt
emma
at
christmas
why
you
silly
it
was
only
a
bit
of
one
of
mother
old
dresses
i
do
wish
you
talk
to
mother
about
it
i
might
go
out
as
companion
or
something
the
word
came
before
the
thought
but
the
thought
was
brought
by
the
word
and
the
thought
stayed
that
very
evening
maisie
began
to
lay
siege
to
her
mother
desired
consent
she
put
her
arguments
very
neatly
so
neatly
that
it
was
hard
for
the
mother
to
oppose
them
without
being
betrayed
into
an
attitude
that
would
seem
grossly
selfish
she
sat
looking
into
the
fire
thinking
of
all
the
little
unceasing
sacrifices
that
had
been
her
life
ever
since
maisie
had
been
hers
even
the
giving
up
of
that
treasured
silk
her
wedding
dress
last
christmas
because
maisie
wanted
something
pretty
to
make
christmas
presents
out
of
she
remembered
it
all
and
now
this
new
great
sacrifice
was
called
for
she
had
given
up
to
maisie
everything
but
her
taste
in
dress
and
now
it
seemed
that
she
was
desired
to
give
up
even
maisie
herself
but
the
other
sacrifices
had
been
for
maisie
good
or
for
her
pleasure
would
this
one
be
for
either
she
saw
her
little
girl
alone
among
strangers
snubbed
looked
down
upon
a
sort
of
upper
servant
with
none
of
a
servant
privileges
she
nerved
herself
to
what
was
always
to
her
an
almost
unbearable
effort
her
heart
was
beating
and
her
hands
trembling
as
she
said
my
dear
it
quite
impossible
i
could
possibly
allow
it
i
must
say
i
do
see
why
said
maisie
with
tears
in
her
voice
her
mother
dropped
the
mass
of
fleecy
white
wool
and
the
clinking
knitting
needles
and
grasped
the
arms
of
her
chair
intensely
her
eyes
behind
the
spectacles
clouded
with
tears
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
child
should
surely
understand
the
agony
it
was
to
her
mother
to
refuse
her
anything
i
could
earn
money
for
you
it
not
myself
i
thinking
about
the
girl
went
on
the
came
out
quite
without
her
conscious
volition
i
wish
you
did
always
think
i
do
everything
for
selfish
reasons
i
do
my
dear
said
the
mother
feebly
i
sure
it
my
duty
maisie
went
on
with
more
tears
than
ever
in
her
voice
i
eighteen
and
i
ought
to
be
earning
something
instead
of
being
a
burden
to
you
the
mother
looked
hopelessly
into
the
fire
she
had
always
tried
to
explain
things
to
maisie
how
was
it
that
maisie
never
understood
i
sure
said
maisie
echoing
her
mother
thought
i
always
try
to
tell
you
how
i
think
about
things
and
you
never
seem
to
understand
of
course
i
wo
go
if
you
wish
it
but
i
think
she
left
the
room
in
tears
and
the
mother
remained
to
torment
herself
with
the
eternal
questions
what
had
she
done
wrong
why
was
maisie
not
contented
what
could
she
do
to
please
her
would
nothing
please
her
but
the
things
that
were
not
for
her
good
smart
clothes
change
novelty
how
could
she
bear
her
life
if
maisie
was
not
pleased
she
went
down
to
supper
shivering
with
misery
and
apprehension
what
a
meal
it
would
be
with
maisie
cold
and
aloof
polite
and
indifferent
but
maisie
was
cheerful
gay
almost
and
her
mother
felt
a
passion
of
gratitude
to
her
daughter
for
not
being
sulky
or
unapproachable
maisie
however
was
only
stepping
back
to
jump
the
better
the
same
scene
with
intenser
variations
was
played
about
twice
a
week
till
the
girl
got
her
way
as
she
always
did
in
the
end
except
in
the
matter
of
cheap
finery
taste
in
dress
was
as
vital
to
the
mother
as
her
religion
then
through
the
influence
of
an
old
governess
of
her
mother
maisie
got
her
wish
she
was
to
go
as
companion
to
an
old
lady
the
mother
of
lady
yalding
and
she
was
to
live
at
yalding
towers
here
was
splendour
here
would
be
life
incident
opportunity
for
her
reading
had
sometimes
strayed
from
to
the
and
she
knew
exactly
what
are
the
chances
of
romance
to
a
humble
companion
in
the
family
of
a
lady
of
title
and
now
maisie
mother
gave
way
to
her
finally
and
completely
even
on
the
question
of
dress
the
old
wardrobe
was
ransacked
to
find
materials
to
fit
her
out
with
clothes
for
her
new
venture
it
was
a
beautiful
time
for
maisie
new
things
and
old
things
made
to
look
as
good
as
new
or
better
it
was
like
having
a
trousseau
the
mother
lavished
on
her
child
every
inch
of
the
old
lace
every
one
of
the
treasured
trinkets
even
the
little
old
locket
that
had
been
the
dead
husband
first
and
maisie
in
the
flutter
of
her
excitement
and
anticipation
was
loving
and
tender
and
charming
and
the
mother
had
her
reward
edward
opposed
a
stolid
and
stony
disapproval
to
all
the
new
enthusiasm
he
said
little
because
he
feared
to
say
too
much
poor
little
maisie
he
said
you
soon
find
out
that
you
know
when
you
were
well
off
edward
i
hate
you
said
maisie
and
she
thought
she
did
but
when
all
the
beautiful
new
clothes
were
packed
and
her
cab
was
at
the
door
some
sense
of
what
she
was
leaving
did
come
to
the
girl
and
she
flung
her
arms
round
her
mother
in
an
embrace
such
as
she
had
never
given
in
her
life
i
do
want
to
go
she
cried
mummy
darling
i
been
a
little
beast
about
it
i
wo
go
if
you
say
you
rather
not
shall
i
send
the
cab
away
i
will
if
you
say
so
my
own
dear
old
mummy
maisie
mother
was
not
a
very
wise
woman
but
she
was
not
fool
enough
to
trust
this
new
softness
no
no
dearest
she
said
go
and
try
your
own
way
god
bless
you
my
darling
you
miss
the
train
if
you
stay
god
bless
you
my
darling
and
maisie
went
away
crying
hard
through
the
new
veil
with
the
black
velvet
spots
on
it
as
for
the
mother
but
she
was
elderly
and
plain
and
foolishly
fond
and
her
emotions
can
have
but
little
interest
for
the
readers
of
romances
and
now
maisie
for
the
first
time
knew
the
meaning
of
home
and
before
she
had
been
at
yalding
a
week
she
had
learned
to
analyse
home
and
to
give
names
to
its
constituents
love
interest
sympathy
liberty
these
were
some
at
yalding
towers
maisie
was
nothing
to
any
one
no
one
knew
or
cared
one
single
little
bit
of
a
straw
whether
she
was
unhappy
or
no
her
time
was
filled
and
overfilled
by
the
attentions
exacted
by
an
old
eccentric
and
very
disagreeable
lady
when
she
put
on
for
the
first
evening
the
least
pretty
of
the
pretty
dresses
she
had
brought
with
her
the
old
lady
looked
at
her
with
a
disapproval
almost
rising
to
repulsion
and
said
i
expect
you
to
wear
black
and
a
linen
collar
and
cuffs
so
another
black
dress
had
to
be
ordered
from
home
and
all
the
pretty
dainty
things
lay
creasing
themselves
with
disuse
in
the
ample
drawers
and
cupboards
of
her
vast
dreary
bedroom
her
employer
was
exacting
and
irritable
when
on
the
third
day
maisie
broke
into
tears
under
the
constant
flood
of
nagging
the
old
lady
told
her
to
go
away
and
not
to
come
back
till
she
could
control
her
temper
i
come
back
when
you
send
for
me
and
not
before
you
hateful
old
thing
said
maisie
to
herself
and
she
sat
down
in
her
fireless
bedroom
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
her
mother
saying
how
happy
she
felt
and
how
kind
every
one
was
and
what
a
lovely
and
altogether
desirable
place
was
yalding
towers
who
shall
say
whether
pride
or
love
or
both
dictated
that
letter
when
her
employer
did
send
for
her
it
was
to
tell
her
very
sharply
that
one
more
such
exhibition
of
sullenness
would
cost
her
her
situation
so
she
had
to
learn
to
school
herself
and
she
did
it
but
the
learning
was
hard
very
hard
and
in
the
learning
she
grew
thinner
and
some
of
the
pretty
pink
in
her
cheeks
faded
away
lady
yalding
when
she
swept
in
in
beautiful
always
spoke
to
the
companion
quite
kindly
and
nicely
and
pleasantly
but
there
were
none
of
those
invitations
to
come
into
the
after
dinner
which
the
had
led
her
to
expect
lady
yalding
was
always
charming
to
every
one
and
maisie
tortured
herself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
only
because
she
had
no
opportunity
to
explain
herself
that
lady
yalding
failed
to
see
how
very
much
out
of
the
common
she
was
she
read
ruskin
industriously
and
once
she
left
her
own
book
of
browning
selections
that
edward
had
given
her
in
the
conservatory
she
imagined
lady
yalding
returning
it
to
her
with
so
are
you
fond
of
poetry
or
it
delightful
to
find
that
you
are
a
lover
of
browning
but
the
book
was
brought
back
to
her
by
a
footman
and
the
old
lady
lectured
her
for
leaving
her
rubbish
littering
about
but
towards
christmas
a
change
came
maisie
had
hoped
more
intensely
than
she
had
ever
in
her
life
hoped
for
anything
for
a
few
days
grace
for
a
sight
of
her
mother
and
the
mahogany
and
the
damask
curtains
and
yes
of
edward
but
the
old
lady
who
really
was
exceptionally
horrid
wondered
how
she
could
ask
for
a
holiday
when
she
had
only
been
in
her
situation
six
weeks
then
the
old
lady
went
off
at
half
an
hour
notice
to
spend
christmas
with
her
other
daughter
maisie
would
have
suspected
a
row
if
lady
yalding
had
been
a
shade
less
charming
and
the
girl
was
left
thus
it
happened
that
lord
yalding
brother
lounged
into
lady
yalding
room
one
day
and
said
who
the
piteous
black
mouse
you
tamed
i
beg
your
pardon
jim
said
lady
yalding
the
crushed
in
a
black
frock
one
meets
her
about
the
corridors
gloomy
sight
chestnut
hair
sort
of
look
oh
it
mother
companion
poor
little
devil
said
the
honourable
james
what
does
she
do
now
the
cat
away
i
beg
your
pardon
my
mind
was
running
on
mice
do
i
do
know
said
lady
yalding
a
little
guiltily
she
a
good
quiet
little
thing
literary
tastes
reads
browning
and
all
that
sort
of
rot
she
all
right
why
do
you
give
her
a
show
she
take
the
shine
out
of
some
of
the
girls
here
if
you
had
her
dressed
my
dear
jim
lady
yalding
said
she
all
right
as
she
is
what
the
good
of
turning
the
child
head
and
giving
her
notions
out
of
her
proper
station
if
i
were
that
child
i
like
to
have
a
little
bit
of
a
fling
just
for
once
the
poor
little
rat
looks
starved
as
though
it
had
laughed
for
a
year
then
it
christmas
peace
and
goodwill
and
all
that
do
you
know
if
i
were
you
i
ask
her
down
a
bit
lady
yalding
thought
a
thing
she
rarely
did
well
she
said
it
pretty
slow
for
her
i
suppose
i
send
her
home
to
her
people
on
christmas
eve
fog
and
frost
and
the
trains
all
anyhow
fanny
fanny
oh
very
well
we
have
her
down
and
go
the
whole
hog
only
make
a
fool
of
the
child
jim
she
a
good
little
thing
and
that
was
how
the
lady
yalding
came
to
sweep
into
the
old
lady
it
was
as
full
of
mahogany
by
the
way
as
maisie
home
in
lewisham
and
spoke
so
kindly
of
maisie
loneliness
that
the
girl
could
have
fallen
down
and
worshipped
at
her
paris
shoes
when
maisie
in
the
figured
lavender
satin
that
had
been
her
mother
swept
across
the
great
hall
on
the
arm
of
the
honourable
james
she
felt
that
this
indeed
was
life
here
was
the
great
world
with
its
infinite
possibilities
how
did
you
get
on
his
asked
him
later
oh
it
quite
a
decent
sort
of
little
mouse
he
said
wants
to
make
sure
you
see
how
cultivated
it
is
quotes
poetry
what
and
talks
about
art
it
a
little
touching
and
all
that
to
see
how
busy
it
is
putting
all
its
poor
little
stock
in
the
tiny
maisie
alone
in
her
room
was
walking
up
and
down
trailing
the
lavender
satin
recalling
with
kindled
eyes
and
cheeks
every
word
every
look
of
her
cavalier
how
kindly
he
had
spoken
yet
how
deferentially
how
he
had
looked
how
he
had
smiled
at
dinner
she
supposed
it
was
his
business
to
talk
to
her
but
afterwards
when
she
was
sitting
a
little
forlornly
and
apart
from
the
noisy
chatter
of
the
how
he
had
come
straight
over
to
her
directly
the
gentlemen
came
into
the
and
she
felt
that
she
had
not
been
wanting
to
herself
on
so
great
an
occasion
i
i
talked
well
i
certain
he
saw
directly
that
i
was
a
silly
idiot
she
lay
long
awake
and
as
the
men
trooped
up
the
stairs
she
tried
to
fancy
that
she
could
already
distinguish
his
footsteps
the
letter
she
wrote
to
her
mother
next
day
was
compared
to
those
other
lying
letters
as
a
lit
chandelier
to
a
and
the
mother
knew
the
difference
poor
darling
she
thought
she
must
have
been
very
miserable
all
this
time
but
she
happy
now
god
bless
her
by
the
week
end
every
thought
every
dream
every
hope
of
life
was
centred
in
the
honourable
james
her
tenderness
her
ambition
turned
towards
him
as
flowers
to
the
sun
and
her
happiness
lighted
a
thousand
little
candles
all
around
her
no
one
could
see
the
candles
of
course
but
every
one
saw
the
radiant
illumination
of
her
beauty
and
the
other
men
of
the
saw
it
too
even
lord
yalding
distinguished
her
by
asking
whether
she
had
read
some
horrid
book
about
earthworms
you
making
a
fool
of
that
girl
jim
said
lady
yalding
i
really
think
it
too
bad
my
good
fanny
do
be
an
adorable
idiot
i
only
trying
to
give
the
poor
little
duffer
a
good
time
there
nothing
else
to
do
the
other
girls
really
are
now
you
know
they
are
fanny
between
ourselves
they
all
duty
people
of
course
she
said
well
only
do
be
careful
he
was
careful
he
subdued
his
impulses
to
tenderness
and
gentle
raillery
he
talked
seriously
to
little
miss
mouse
and
presently
he
found
that
she
was
seriously
talking
to
him
telling
him
for
instance
how
she
wrote
poetry
and
how
she
longed
to
show
it
to
some
one
and
ask
whether
it
really
was
so
bad
as
she
sometimes
feared
what
could
he
do
but
beg
her
to
show
it
to
him
but
there
he
pulled
himself
up
short
there
skating
we
going
to
drive
over
to
dansent
would
you
like
to
come
her
grey
eyes
looked
up
quickly
and
the
long
lashes
drooped
over
them
she
had
read
of
that
trick
in
a
book
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
help
knowing
it
her
answer
to
his
question
came
from
a
book
too
though
it
also
came
from
her
heart
ah
she
said
you
know
then
the
honourable
james
was
honestly
frightened
next
day
he
had
a
telegram
and
departed
abruptly
and
as
abruptly
the
old
lady
returned
and
now
maisie
had
a
secret
joy
to
feed
on
a
manna
to
sustain
her
in
the
wilderness
of
her
tiresome
life
she
thought
of
he
loved
her
she
was
certain
of
it
miss
mouse
could
imagine
no
reason
but
love
for
the
kindness
he
had
shown
her
he
had
gone
away
without
a
word
but
that
was
for
some
good
reason
probably
he
had
gone
to
confess
to
his
mother
how
he
had
given
his
whole
heart
to
a
penniless
orphan
well
she
was
half
an
orphan
anyway
but
the
days
slipped
by
and
he
did
not
come
back
all
that
bright
time
at
christmas
had
faded
like
a
picture
from
a
when
the
slide
is
covered
lady
yalding
was
quite
nice
and
kind
but
she
left
maisie
to
the
work
maisie
was
paid
for
maisie
mother
perceived
through
maisie
studied
accounts
of
her
happiness
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
reality
then
at
last
when
the
days
grew
unbearable
maisie
wrote
to
him
a
prim
little
letter
with
agitated
between
the
lines
where
he
being
no
fool
did
not
fail
to
find
them
yet
he
had
to
answer
the
letter
he
did
it
briefly
dear
miss
rolleston
he
wrote
i
have
received
your
letter
and
the
little
poem
which
is
very
nice
poems
about
spring
are
the
pleasantest
kind
i
with
kind
regards
i
am
yours
sincerely
it
was
not
as
you
may
see
worth
the
heartache
with
which
maisie
watched
for
it
it
was
when
she
wrote
again
and
sent
more
verses
that
he
decided
he
must
not
mince
matters
dear
miss
rolleston
was
his
second
letter
it
is
good
of
you
to
write
again
now
i
do
hope
you
wo
be
offended
with
me
for
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
am
so
much
older
than
you
you
know
and
i
know
you
are
alone
at
yalding
with
no
one
to
advise
you
so
it
must
be
my
duty
to
do
it
though
for
my
own
sake
i
should
of
course
like
to
advise
you
quite
differently
it
was
a
great
pleasure
to
me
to
hear
from
you
but
i
must
not
allow
myself
that
pleasure
again
even
if
you
were
willing
to
give
it
to
me
it
would
not
be
fair
to
you
to
let
you
write
any
more
to
a
man
who
is
not
related
to
you
try
to
forgive
me
for
being
unselfish
and
acting
in
your
interests
and
not
my
own
and
again
with
kind
regards
he
was
hers
sincerely
poor
pretty
little
duffer
he
said
as
he
closed
the
envelope
but
it
not
real
do
i
know
the
sort
of
thing
she
simply
bored
to
death
down
there
and
it
all
my
fault
anyhow
by
jove
i
never
try
to
do
any
one
a
good
turn
again
as
long
as
i
live
fanny
was
perfectly
right
the
letter
came
by
the
second
post
when
maisie
was
engaged
in
drearily
reading
her
employer
to
sleep
after
lunch
it
lay
on
her
lap
but
she
kept
her
eyes
from
it
and
read
on
intelligibly
if
not
with
expression
the
old
lady
dozed
maisie
opened
her
letter
and
before
she
could
even
have
had
time
to
put
up
a
hand
to
save
herself
her
spanish
castle
was
tumbling
about
her
ears
a
curious
giddy
feeling
seemed
to
catch
at
the
back
of
her
neck
the
room
gave
a
sickening
she
caught
at
her
not
here
i
must
faint
here
not
with
his
letter
in
my
hand
she
got
out
of
the
room
somehow
and
somehow
she
got
into
hat
and
jacket
and
boots
put
her
quarter
salary
in
her
purse
and
walked
out
of
the
front
door
and
straight
down
the
great
drive
that
she
had
come
up
four
months
ago
with
such
bright
hopes
she
went
to
the
station
and
she
took
a
train
and
she
never
stopped
nor
stayed
till
she
was
at
home
again
she
pushed
past
the
frightened
maid
and
pale
and
shabby
with
eyes
and
dusty
black
gown
she
burst
into
her
room
the
scent
of
and
and
buttered
toast
met
her
and
it
was
as
the
perfume
of
paradise
edward
was
there
but
she
was
in
no
mood
to
bother
about
edward
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
buried
her
face
in
the
knitting
on
her
mother
lap
and
felt
thin
arms
go
round
her
it
nothing
i
tired
of
it
all
i
come
home
was
all
she
said
but
presently
she
reached
out
a
hand
to
edward
and
he
took
it
and
held
it
as
it
were
absently
and
the
three
sat
by
the
fire
and
spoke
little
and
were
content
to
her
dying
day
maisie
will
never
forget
the
sense
of
peace
of
enfolding
care
and
love
unchanging
and
unchangeable
that
came
to
her
as
she
woke
next
morning
to
find
her
mother
standing
by
her
bed
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
hands
oh
mummy
darling
she
cried
throwing
her
arms
round
her
mother
and
nearly
upsetting
the
tea
i
have
had
a
single
drop
of
tea
all
the
time
i
been
away
that
was
all
she
found
words
to
tell
her
mother
later
there
was
edward
and
she
told
him
most
things
but
i
imagine
not
all
but
the
mother
was
content
without
spoken
confidences
she
knew
that
maisie
had
suffered
and
that
now
she
had
her
little
girl
again
to
wrap
warm
in
her
love
as
before
this
was
happiness
enough
this
story
i
know
is
instructive
enough
for
a
sunday
school
prize
it
ought
to
be
tagged
at
the
end
with
a
moral
i
ca
help
it
it
is
true
of
course
it
is
not
what
usually
happens
many
companions
no
doubt
marry
honourable
james
or
even
dukes
and
are
never
at
all
glad
to
get
home
to
their
mothers
and
their
edwards
but
maisie
was
different
she
feels
now
a
sort
of
grateful
tenderness
for
yalding
towers
because
but
for
the
dream
she
dreamed
there
she
might
never
have
really
awakened
never
have
known
fully
and
without
mistake
what
it
was
in
life
that
she
truly
cared
for
and
such
knowledge
is
half
the
secret
of
happiness
that
by
the
way
is
really
the
moral
of
this
story
ix
the
old
wife
yes
married
by
the
of
june
introduce
my
wife
to
the
tenants
on
christmas
eve
or
no
fortune
that
was
my
uncle
last
and
worst
joke
he
was
reputed
a
funny
man
in
his
time
the
alternatives
are
pretty
ghastly
either
way
does
that
rather
depend
sylvia
queried
with
a
swift
blue
glance
from
under
veiling
lashes
michael
answered
her
with
a
look
the
male
counterpart
of
her
own
from
dark
devon
eyes
the
upper
lid
arched
in
a
perfect
semicircle
over
pure
grey
yes
but
my
wife
must
have
a
hundred
a
year
of
her
own
in
consols
to
protect
me
from
lone
lorn
lamb
that
i
am
sylvia
emphasised
the
sigh
with
which
she
admitted
her
indigence
her
pretty
eyebrows
owned
plaintively
that
she
a
struggling
artist
had
no
claim
against
the
nation
mary
has
just
a
hundred
a
year
she
said
her
voice
as
she
looked
across
the
room
to
where
demure
in
braided
locks
and
grey
camlet
her
companion
sat
knitting
i
daresay
michael
answered
indifferently
following
her
eyes
flight
and
her
tone
low
pitch
but
she
young
i
shall
advertise
for
an
elderly
housekeeper
and
vivra
the
words
lightly
cast
on
the
thin
soil
of
a
foolish
with
a
pretty
woman
bore
fruit
a
week
later
michael
wood
stood
aghast
before
a
tray
heaped
with
letters
answers
to
his
advertisement
housekeeper
wanted
must
be
the
older
the
better
salary
a
year
not
much
he
had
thought
a
year
if
by
paying
it
he
might
win
a
wife
who
would
entitle
him
to
an
annual
whose
declining
years
he
might
kindly
cheer
and
whose
death
would
set
him
free
to
marry
a
wife
whom
he
could
love
his
fancy
drifted
pleasantly
towards
sylvia
michael
was
a
lazy
man
who
bristled
with
business
instincts
he
telephoned
to
the
nearest
typewriters
association
for
a
secretary
and
to
this
young
woman
he
committed
the
charge
of
answering
the
letters
which
his
advertisement
had
drawn
forth
the
answer
was
to
be
the
same
to
all
call
at
hare
court
temple
between
and
and
the
dates
fixed
for
such
calling
were
arranged
to
allow
about
fifty
interviews
daily
for
the
next
week
or
two
for
michael
was
a
bold
man
as
well
as
a
lazy
one
the
next
morning
faultlessly
dressed
with
carnations
in
his
buttonhole
he
composed
himself
in
his
pleasant
room
to
await
his
first
batch
of
callers
they
came
and
michael
strong
in
his
unswerving
determination
not
to
forfeit
his
chance
of
inheriting
the
a
year
left
him
under
his
mad
uncle
mad
will
saw
them
all
one
after
the
other
but
he
did
not
like
any
of
them
they
were
old
that
he
did
not
mind
it
was
indeed
of
the
essence
of
the
contract
but
they
were
frowsy
too
with
reticules
of
scarred
brownish
leather
and
mangy
fur
trimmings
worn
fringes
and
beaded
mantles
whence
time
and
poverty
had
clawed
handfuls
of
the
bright
beads
each
of
them
was
as
a
wife
even
as
a
wife
in
name
impossible
the
task
of
rejection
was
softened
to
his
hand
by
the
fact
that
not
one
of
them
could
boast
the
necessary
hundred
a
year
in
consols
the
interviews
over
michael
his
spirit
crushed
by
the
spectacle
of
so
many
women
anxious
to
find
a
refuge
at
an
age
when
their
children
and
grandchildren
should
in
their
own
homes
have
been
rising
up
to
call
them
blessed
went
to
lounge
a
restorative
hour
in
sylvia
bright
little
studio
and
laugh
with
her
over
his
dilemma
he
would
have
liked
to
sigh
with
her
too
but
the
pathos
of
the
homeless
old
women
escaped
her
she
saw
only
the
humour
of
the
situation
there
no
harm
done
if
it
amuses
you
she
said
but
you
never
marry
an
old
woman
fifteen
thousand
pounds
a
year
said
michael
softly
next
day
more
poor
old
ladies
all
eager
anxious
ineligible
it
was
on
the
third
day
that
the
old
lady
in
came
in
sweet
as
a
pressed
flower
in
an
old
dainty
as
a
pigeon
in
spring
her
white
hair
the
white
lace
of
her
collar
the
black
lace
of
her
mantle
her
beautiful
little
hands
in
their
perfect
gloves
all
appealed
irresistibly
to
michael
æsthetic
sense
what
an
ideal
housekeeper
he
said
to
himself
as
he
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
then
an
odd
thrill
of
discomfort
and
shame
shot
through
him
this
delicate
dainty
old
lady
he
was
to
insult
her
by
a
form
of
marriage
and
then
to
live
near
her
waiting
for
her
death
no
it
was
impossible
the
whole
thing
was
impossible
he
found
himself
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
so
i
fear
i
am
already
suited
the
old
lady
raised
eyebrows
as
delicate
as
sylvia
own
hardly
i
think
she
said
since
your
servant
admitted
me
to
an
interview
with
you
may
i
ask
you
one
or
two
questions
before
you
finally
decide
against
me
the
voice
was
low
and
soft
the
voice
men
loved
in
the
early
sixties
before
the
shrill
shriek
became
the
voice
of
fashionable
ladies
certainly
michael
said
he
could
hardly
say
less
and
in
the
tumult
of
embarrassment
that
had
swept
over
him
he
could
not
for
his
life
have
said
more
the
old
lady
went
on
i
am
competent
to
manage
a
house
i
can
read
aloud
fairly
well
i
am
a
good
nurse
in
case
of
sickness
and
i
am
accustomed
to
entertain
but
i
gather
from
the
amount
of
the
salary
offered
that
some
other
duties
would
be
required
of
me
that
clever
of
her
too
michael
thought
none
of
the
others
saw
that
he
bowed
would
you
enlighten
me
she
went
on
as
to
the
nature
of
the
services
you
would
require
ah
yes
of
course
he
said
glibly
and
then
stopped
short
from
your
hesitation
said
the
old
lady
with
unimpaired
i
gather
that
the
matter
involves
an
explanation
of
some
delicacy
or
else
pardon
the
egotism
that
my
appearance
is
personally
unpleasing
to
you
no
oh
michael
said
very
eagerly
on
the
contrary
if
i
may
say
so
it
is
just
because
you
are
so
so
exactly
my
ideal
of
an
old
lady
that
i
feel
i
ca
go
on
with
the
business
and
that
put
stupidly
so
that
it
sounds
like
an
insult
please
forgive
me
she
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
through
her
spectacles
you
see
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
grandmother
she
said
why
not
tell
me
the
truth
and
to
his
horror
and
astonishment
he
told
it
and
that
what
i
meant
to
do
he
ended
it
was
a
mad
idea
and
i
see
now
that
if
i
do
it
at
all
i
must
marry
some
one
who
is
not
who
is
not
like
you
you
have
made
me
ashamed
of
myself
a
spot
of
pink
colour
glowed
in
her
faded
cheek
the
old
lady
put
up
her
gloved
hand
and
touched
her
cheek
as
if
it
burned
she
got
up
and
walked
to
the
window
and
stood
there
looking
out
if
you
going
to
do
it
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
hardly
audible
i
have
been
used
to
live
among
beautiful
surroundings
i
should
like
to
end
my
days
among
them
i
do
not
come
of
a
family
you
would
not
have
long
to
wait
for
your
freedom
and
your
second
wife
never
in
all
his
days
had
michael
known
so
sharp
an
agony
of
embarrassment
when
must
you
be
married
the
old
lady
went
on
calmly
to
ensure
your
fortunes
and
estates
in
about
a
month
well
mr
wood
i
make
you
a
formal
offer
of
marriage
and
for
reference
i
can
give
you
my
banker
and
my
solicitor
her
voice
was
calm
it
was
his
voice
that
trembled
as
he
answered
you
are
too
good
i
ca
see
that
it
would
be
fair
to
you
may
i
think
about
it
till
the
contrast
between
the
old
lady
dainty
correctness
of
attire
and
speech
and
the
extraordinary
unconventionality
of
her
proposal
made
michael
brain
reel
she
turned
from
the
window
again
looked
him
fairly
in
the
eyes
and
said
you
will
not
find
me
unconventional
in
other
matters
this
is
purely
an
affair
of
business
and
i
approach
it
in
a
business
spirit
you
would
be
giving
a
home
to
one
who
wants
it
and
i
should
be
helping
you
to
what
you
need
still
more
i
have
never
been
married
i
never
wished
to
marry
and
when
i
am
dead
do
look
so
i
should
not
die
any
sooner
because
you
you
had
married
me
my
name
is
thrale
frances
thrale
that
is
my
card
that
you
have
been
pulling
to
pieces
while
you
have
been
talking
to
me
shall
i
come
and
see
you
again
at
this
time
it
is
not
a
subject
on
which
i
should
wish
either
to
write
or
to
receive
letters
he
could
only
acquiesce
at
the
door
the
old
lady
turned
if
you
think
i
look
so
old
as
to
make
your
marriage
too
absurd
she
said
and
now
for
the
first
time
her
voice
trembled
i
could
dye
my
hair
oh
no
michael
said
your
hair
is
beautiful
and
thank
you
as
the
old
lady
went
down
the
dusty
temple
stairs
she
stamped
a
small
foot
angrily
on
the
worn
oak
fool
she
said
how
could
you
hateful
shameless
unwomanly
and
it
all
for
nothing
too
he
never
do
it
it
mad
michael
went
straight
to
sylvia
and
told
his
tale
and
i
felt
i
could
he
said
she
is
the
daintiest
sweetest
little
old
lady
i
could
marry
her
and
see
her
every
day
and
live
in
the
hope
of
her
death
i
do
see
why
not
sylvia
said
a
little
coldly
she
would
die
any
sooner
because
you
married
her
and
anyway
she
ca
have
long
to
live
the
words
were
almost
those
of
the
little
old
lady
herself
yet
or
perhaps
for
that
very
reason
they
jarred
on
michael
mood
he
alleged
business
and
cut
short
his
call
next
day
miss
thrale
called
again
mr
wood
was
sorry
to
have
given
her
so
much
trouble
he
had
decided
that
the
idea
was
too
wild
and
must
be
abandoned
is
it
because
i
am
too
old
said
the
old
lady
wistfully
would
you
marry
me
if
i
were
young
upon
my
word
i
believe
i
would
michael
surprised
himself
by
saying
that
it
was
not
the
answer
miss
thrale
expected
was
evident
from
her
smile
of
sudden
amusement
may
i
say
she
said
in
return
for
what
in
its
way
is
a
compliment
that
i
like
you
very
much
i
would
take
care
of
you
and
i
shall
perhaps
not
live
more
than
a
year
or
two
the
tremor
of
her
voice
touched
him
the
a
year
pulled
at
his
will
in
that
instant
he
saw
the
broad
glades
of
waving
bracken
the
big
trees
of
the
park
the
sober
face
of
the
great
house
he
might
inherit
looking
out
over
the
smooth
green
lawns
he
looked
again
at
the
little
lady
after
all
he
was
more
than
thirty
the
world
would
laugh
well
they
laughed
best
who
laughed
last
and
after
a
few
years
there
would
be
sylvia
pretty
charming
enchanting
sylvia
he
put
the
thought
of
her
roughly
away
not
because
he
was
ashamed
of
it
but
because
it
hurt
him
the
thought
that
sylvia
should
wait
for
a
dead
woman
shoes
had
seemed
natural
what
hurt
him
was
that
she
herself
should
see
nothing
unnatural
in
such
waiting
the
silence
had
grown
to
the
limit
that
spells
discomfort
the
ticking
of
the
tall
clock
the
rustle
of
the
plane
tree
leaves
outside
the
window
the
discords
of
fleet
street
harmonised
by
distance
all
deepened
the
silence
and
italicised
it
she
spoke
well
she
said
the
plane
tree
leaves
murmured
eloquently
of
the
great
oaks
in
the
park
the
old
lady
eyes
looked
at
him
appealingly
through
the
glasses
how
she
would
like
that
old
place
and
his
debts
he
could
pay
them
all
i
will
he
said
suddenly
if
you
will
i
will
and
i
pray
you
may
never
regret
it
i
do
think
will
regret
it
she
said
gently
it
is
a
truly
kind
act
to
me
bank
and
solicitor
duly
consulted
testified
to
miss
respectability
and
to
her
income
the
requisite
hundred
a
year
in
consols
and
on
a
certain
day
in
june
michael
wood
woke
from
a
feverish
dream
in
which
obstinacy
and
the
longing
for
money
had
fought
with
many
better
things
and
worsted
them
to
find
himself
married
to
a
woman
of
sixty
the
awakening
took
place
in
his
rooms
in
the
temple
he
had
yielded
to
the
little
old
lady
entreaties
and
consented
most
willingly
to
forego
the
wedding
journey
in
this
case
so
sad
a
mockery
the
set
was
a
large
one
five
rooms
it
seemed
that
they
might
live
here
and
neither
irk
the
other
and
she
was
in
the
room
he
had
caused
to
be
prepared
for
her
dainty
and
neat
as
herself
and
he
left
alone
in
the
room
where
he
had
first
seen
her
crossed
his
arms
on
the
table
and
thought
his
and
it
might
have
been
sylvia
the
rustle
of
whose
dress
he
could
hear
in
the
next
room
he
groaned
then
he
laid
his
head
on
his
arms
and
cried
like
a
child
that
has
lost
its
favourite
toy
for
he
saw
suddenly
that
respect
for
his
old
wife
must
keep
him
from
ever
seeing
sylvia
now
and
life
looked
grey
as
the
thames
in
february
twilight
a
timid
hand
on
his
shoulder
startled
him
to
the
raising
of
his
face
the
little
old
lady
stood
beside
him
ah
do
she
said
softly
do
believe
me
it
will
be
all
right
your
old
wife
wo
live
more
than
a
year
i
know
it
take
courage
he
said
in
his
turn
it
a
wicked
thing
i
done
forgive
me
if
only
we
could
have
been
friends
i
ca
bear
to
think
i
shall
make
you
unhappy
my
dear
boy
she
said
we
are
friends
i
am
your
housekeeper
in
a
year
at
latest
you
will
see
the
last
of
my
white
hairs
be
brave
he
could
not
understand
the
pang
her
words
gave
him
and
now
began
for
these
two
a
strange
life
in
those
temple
rooms
ideal
nest
for
young
lovers
mrs
wood
the
kept
house
with
firm
and
capable
little
hands
comfort
which
michael
lazy
nature
loved
but
could
not
achieve
reigned
peacefully
the
old
lady
kept
much
to
her
own
rooms
but
whenever
he
needed
talk
she
was
there
and
she
could
talk
she
had
read
much
reflected
much
in
her
mind
his
own
ideas
found
mating
germs
and
bore
fruit
of
beautiful
dreams
great
thoughts
his
verses
neglected
this
long
time
since
sylvia
did
not
care
for
poetry
flourished
once
more
and
music
sylvia
taste
in
music
had
been
sullivan
the
old
wife
touched
the
piano
with
magic
fingers
and
bach
beethoven
wagner
came
to
transfigure
the
temple
rooms
michael
had
never
been
so
contented
never
so
wretched
for
as
the
quiet
weeks
went
by
the
leaves
fell
from
the
plane
tree
and
the
time
drew
near
when
he
must
show
his
wife
to
the
tenants
his
wife
in
these
months
a
very
real
friendship
had
grown
up
between
them
michael
had
never
met
a
woman
old
or
young
whose
tastes
chimed
so
tunefully
with
his
own
ah
what
a
pity
he
had
not
met
a
woman
with
these
tastes
this
soul
and
now
liking
friendship
affection
all
the
finer
nobler
side
of
love
he
could
indeed
feel
for
his
old
wife
but
love
lovers
love
that
would
set
the
seal
on
all
the
rest
this
he
might
never
know
except
for
some
other
woman
who
would
succeed
to
his
wife
title
badly
as
michael
had
behaved
i
think
it
is
permissible
to
be
sorry
for
him
his
wife
in
fact
was
very
sorry
one
day
he
met
sylvia
in
the
park
and
all
the
other
side
of
him
thrilled
with
pleasure
he
sat
by
her
an
hour
his
eyes
drinking
in
her
fresh
beauty
while
his
soul
shrivelled
more
and
more
ah
why
could
she
not
as
his
wife
could
instead
of
merely
chattering
his
wife
looked
sad
that
evening
he
asked
the
reason
i
saw
you
in
the
park
she
said
are
you
going
to
see
her
do
compromise
her
it
not
worth
while
he
kissed
her
hand
in
its
black
mitten
and
in
a
flash
of
pain
saw
the
black
funeral
when
she
should
be
carried
from
his
house
and
he
be
left
free
to
marry
sylvia
and
now
the
days
had
dropped
past
so
even
was
their
flow
that
it
seemed
rapid
and
in
another
week
it
would
be
christmas
and
i
must
show
you
to
the
tenants
said
he
my
poor
boy
she
said
it
was
just
as
she
had
risen
to
bid
him
good
night
be
brave
perhaps
it
wo
be
so
bad
as
you
think
good
night
he
sat
still
after
she
had
left
him
gazing
into
the
fire
and
thinking
thoughts
in
which
now
the
estate
and
the
fortune
played
but
little
part
at
last
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
he
said
i
have
no
lover
no
wife
but
i
have
a
companion
a
friend
one
in
a
million
and
again
the
black
funeral
trailed
its
slow
length
before
his
eyes
and
he
shuddered
i
have
not
sought
to
deceive
the
reader
he
knows
as
well
as
i
do
that
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
a
young
and
beautiful
woman
stood
on
the
threshold
her
eyes
were
shining
round
her
neck
were
gleaming
pearls
she
was
playing
for
a
high
stake
and
being
a
true
woman
she
had
disdained
no
honest
artifice
that
might
help
her
she
wore
shining
white
silk
severely
plain
and
her
brown
hair
was
dressed
high
on
her
head
a
woman
one
shade
less
intuitive
would
have
let
the
dusky
masses
fall
over
a
michael
she
said
i
am
your
wife
are
you
going
to
forgive
me
he
raised
himself
slowly
from
his
chair
and
his
eyes
dwelt
on
detail
after
detail
of
the
beauty
before
him
my
wife
he
said
you
are
a
stranger
i
disguise
myself
well
my
sister
told
me
about
your
advertisement
she
lives
with
sylvia
maddox
we
each
have
a
hundred
pounds
a
year
at
first
i
did
it
for
fun
but
when
i
had
seen
how
how
nice
you
were
my
mother
is
very
poor
there
are
no
excuses
but
are
you
going
to
forgive
me
any
other
woman
to
whom
forgiveness
meant
all
that
it
meant
to
her
might
have
kneeled
at
his
feet
frances
stood
erect
by
the
door
anyway
she
said
biting
her
lip
i
have
saved
you
from
sylvia
for
the
sake
of
that
forgive
me
that
stung
him
as
she
had
known
it
would
forgive
you
he
said
never
you
spoiled
my
life
but
he
took
a
step
towards
her
as
he
spoke
she
took
an
equal
step
back
take
courage
she
said
who
knows
but
i
may
die
before
next
june
after
all
good
night
i
hate
you
he
said
and
took
another
step
forward
but
the
door
closed
in
his
face
next
morning
the
old
lady
white
haired
and
mittened
appeared
behind
the
breakfast
tea
michael
almost
thought
he
had
dreamed
till
her
eyes
now
without
their
glasses
met
his
timidly
let
us
end
this
at
least
he
said
ten
minutes
of
fuming
ended
in
tepid
tea
poured
by
a
beautiful
girl
he
watched
her
in
silence
it
horrible
he
broke
out
you
a
strange
woman
and
there
you
sit
pouring
tea
out
as
if
who
are
you
i
do
know
you
do
you
she
said
quietly
and
then
he
remembered
all
the
old
talks
with
the
old
wife
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
do
want
to
be
a
brute
it
no
use
my
saying
i
sorry
she
said
you
he
leaned
forward
to
put
the
question
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
she
said
perhaps
look
here
let
speak
of
it
till
after
christmas
let
just
go
on
as
we
did
before
so
the
days
wore
on
but
the
situation
when
michael
lived
in
torment
in
the
company
of
his
old
wife
was
simplicity
itself
compared
to
his
new
life
with
a
wife
young
beautiful
and
a
stranger
yet
in
all
essentials
his
dearest
friend
this
discomfort
grew
daily
hourly
branching
out
into
ever
fresh
embarrassments
new
and
harassing
vexatious
half
understood
wholly
resented
the
wife
had
her
burden
to
bear
also
the
laundress
had
only
known
the
old
wife
as
mrs
wood
she
thought
i
was
your
mother
the
wife
said
when
michael
propounded
the
difficulty
but
the
laundress
attitude
to
the
new
mrs
wood
had
a
sting
that
was
almost
punishment
enough
to
the
wife
had
michael
only
known
for
all
that
she
had
done
amiss
the
hour
of
departure
for
the
christmas
festivities
at
wood
grange
came
as
a
relief
from
the
persistent
pinpricks
of
unexplained
emotion
which
tormented
him
his
wife
was
young
and
beautiful
yet
he
was
only
conscious
of
repulsion
he
hated
her
for
her
trickery
but
most
he
hated
her
because
she
had
cheated
him
of
the
old
wife
the
friend
the
who
had
grown
to
be
so
much
and
so
much
the
best
part
in
his
life
for
now
there
was
no
confidence
between
the
two
no
talk
no
reading
no
music
to
brighten
the
temple
rooms
they
lived
in
an
almost
complete
silence
every
window
of
the
grange
shone
out
with
yellow
light
across
the
snow
for
once
christmas
had
been
kind
and
seasonable
a
white
sheet
covered
the
world
holly
gleamed
against
old
oak
priceless
silver
saved
from
the
in
cromwell
hard
days
shone
above
white
napery
on
the
long
tables
the
tenants
dinner
was
over
and
now
was
the
moment
when
according
to
the
will
michael
wood
wife
must
be
presented
to
the
tenants
then
assembled
the
slender
figure
in
white
woollen
cloth
and
white
fur
with
christmas
roses
at
its
breast
stood
on
the
daïs
at
the
end
of
the
great
hall
and
the
tenants
cheered
themselves
hoarse
at
the
mere
sight
of
her
beautiful
face
her
kind
eyes
it
went
off
very
well
michael
said
when
the
last
guest
gone
the
last
shutter
closed
the
last
servant
departed
the
two
stood
alone
in
the
long
yes
think
if
you
had
had
to
present
to
them
the
old
wife
i
loved
the
old
wife
he
said
obstinately
but
his
voice
was
not
quite
steady
i
wish
she
said
playing
with
the
christmas
roses
she
wore
i
wish
you
would
try
to
forgive
me
it
was
horribly
wrong
but
i
began
it
as
a
joke
you
see
i
had
only
just
come
over
from
the
convent
where
i
was
brought
up
i
thought
it
would
be
such
fun
i
was
always
good
at
theatricals
i
will
never
do
anything
silly
again
and
i
go
away
and
you
need
never
see
me
again
and
you
got
the
money
and
the
old
place
have
you
and
i
got
them
for
you
and
do
forgive
me
it
began
as
a
silly
schoolgirl
joke
indeed
but
a
convent
you
have
read
and
thought
it
was
my
father
he
made
me
read
and
think
and
when
he
died
all
the
money
went
and
my
mother
is
poor
oh
michael
do
be
so
flinty
say
you
forgive
me
before
i
go
it
all
began
in
a
joke
began
yes
but
why
did
you
go
on
because
i
i
did
like
sylvia
and
i
liked
you
rather
but
i
be
a
nuisance
i
go
back
to
mother
say
you
forgive
me
i
go
by
the
first
train
in
the
morning
the
first
train
said
michael
absently
is
the
but
is
christmas
day
i
daresay
they
run
the
same
as
on
sunday
she
took
her
white
cloak
from
the
settle
by
the
fire
good
night
she
said
sadly
you
are
very
hard
wo
you
even
shake
hands
we
had
no
roses
at
our
wedding
he
said
still
absently
but
there
are
roses
at
christmas
he
raised
his
hand
to
the
white
flowers
she
wore
and
touched
them
softly
white
roses
too
for
a
wedding
he
said
good
night
she
said
again
and
you
will
go
to
your
mother
by
the
train
or
the
if
the
trains
run
the
same
as
on
sunday
and
i
am
to
forgive
you
and
shake
hands
before
we
part
well
well
he
took
the
hand
she
held
out
caught
the
other
and
stood
holding
them
his
grey
eyes
seeking
hers
her
head
thrown
back
her
hands
stretched
out
she
looked
at
him
from
arm
length
dear
he
said
a
mute
glance
questioned
him
then
lashes
longer
than
sylvia
veiled
the
dark
eyes
he
spoke
again
dear
you
know
you
hate
me
she
said
he
raised
her
hands
to
his
lips
have
you
forgotten
sylvia
absolutely
thank
god
and
you
i
after
all
we
are
married
though
there
were
no
roses
at
our
june
wedding
again
her
eyes
questioned
mutely
he
leaned
forward
and
touched
the
christmas
roses
with
his
lips
then
he
dropped
her
hands
and
caught
her
by
the
shoulders
oh
foolish
foolish
foolish
people
he
said
we
two
are
man
and
wife
my
wife
my
wife
my
wife
we
are
are
we
i
suppose
we
are
she
said
and
her
face
leaned
a
little
towards
his
well
then
said
he
x
the
house
of
silence
the
thief
stood
close
under
the
high
wall
and
looked
to
right
and
left
to
the
right
the
road
wound
white
and
sinuous
lying
like
a
twisted
ribbon
over
the
broad
grey
shoulder
of
the
hill
to
the
left
the
road
turned
sharply
down
towards
the
river
beyond
the
ford
the
road
went
away
slowly
in
a
curve
prolonged
for
miles
through
the
green
marshes
no
least
black
fly
of
a
figure
stirred
on
it
there
were
no
travellers
at
such
an
hour
on
such
a
road
the
thief
looked
across
the
valley
at
the
top
of
the
mountain
flushed
with
sunset
and
at
the
of
the
olives
about
its
base
the
terraces
of
olives
were
already
dusk
with
twilight
but
his
keen
eyes
could
not
have
missed
the
smallest
variance
or
shifting
of
their
lights
and
shadows
nothing
stirred
there
he
was
alone
then
turning
he
looked
again
at
the
wall
behind
him
the
face
of
it
was
grey
and
sombre
but
all
along
the
top
of
it
in
the
crannies
of
the
coping
stones
orange
wallflowers
and
snapdragons
shone
among
the
haze
of
grasses
he
looked
again
at
the
place
where
some
of
the
stones
had
fallen
from
the
coping
had
fallen
within
the
wall
for
none
lay
in
the
road
without
the
bough
of
a
mighty
tree
covered
the
gap
with
its
green
mantle
from
the
eyes
of
any
chance
wayfarer
but
the
thief
was
no
chance
wayfarer
and
he
had
surprised
the
only
infidelity
of
the
great
wall
to
its
trust
to
the
chance
wayfarer
too
the
wall
denial
had
seemed
absolute
unanswerable
its
solid
stone
close
knit
by
mortar
hardly
less
solid
showed
not
only
a
defence
it
offered
a
defiance
a
menace
but
the
thief
had
learnt
his
trade
he
saw
that
the
mortar
might
be
loosened
a
little
here
broken
a
little
there
and
now
the
crumbs
of
it
fell
rustling
on
to
the
dry
dusty
grass
of
the
roadside
he
drew
back
took
two
quick
steps
forward
and
with
a
spring
sudden
and
agile
as
a
cat
grasped
the
wall
where
the
gap
showed
and
drew
himself
up
then
he
rubbed
his
hands
on
his
knees
because
his
hands
were
bloody
from
the
sudden
grasping
of
the
rough
stones
and
sat
astride
on
the
wall
he
parted
the
leafy
boughs
and
looked
down
below
him
lay
the
stones
that
had
fallen
from
the
wall
already
grass
was
growing
upon
the
mound
they
made
as
he
ventured
his
head
beyond
the
green
leafage
the
level
light
of
the
sinking
sun
struck
him
in
the
eyes
it
was
like
a
blow
he
dropped
softly
from
the
wall
and
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
tree
looking
listening
before
him
stretched
the
park
wide
and
still
dotted
here
and
there
with
trees
and
overlaid
with
gold
poured
from
the
west
he
held
his
breath
and
listened
there
was
no
wind
to
stir
the
leaves
to
those
rustlings
which
may
deceive
and
disconcert
the
keenest
and
the
boldest
only
the
sleepy
twitter
of
birds
and
the
little
sudden
soft
movements
of
them
in
the
dusky
privacy
of
the
branches
there
was
in
all
the
broad
park
no
sign
of
any
other
living
thing
the
thief
trod
softly
along
under
the
wall
where
the
trees
were
thickest
and
at
every
step
he
paused
to
look
and
listen
it
was
quite
suddenly
that
he
came
upon
the
little
lodge
near
the
great
gates
of
wrought
iron
with
the
marble
bearing
upon
them
the
two
gaunt
griffins
the
cognisance
of
the
noble
house
whose
lands
these
were
the
thief
drew
back
into
the
shadow
and
stood
still
only
his
heart
beat
thickly
he
stood
still
as
the
tree
trunk
beside
him
looking
listening
he
told
himself
that
he
heard
nothing
saw
nothing
yet
he
became
aware
of
things
that
the
door
of
the
lodge
was
not
closed
that
some
of
its
windows
were
broken
and
that
into
its
little
garden
straw
and
litter
had
drifted
from
the
open
door
and
that
between
the
stone
step
and
the
threshold
grass
was
growing
inches
high
when
he
was
aware
of
this
he
stepped
forward
and
entered
the
lodge
all
the
sordid
sadness
of
a
little
deserted
home
met
him
here
broken
crocks
and
bent
pans
straw
old
rags
and
a
brooding
dusty
stillness
there
has
been
no
one
here
since
the
old
keeper
died
they
told
the
truth
said
the
thief
and
he
made
haste
to
leave
the
lodge
for
there
was
nothing
in
it
now
that
any
man
need
covet
only
desolation
and
the
memory
of
death
so
he
went
slowly
among
the
trees
and
by
devious
ways
drew
a
little
nearer
to
the
great
house
that
stood
in
its
walled
garden
in
the
middle
of
the
park
from
very
far
off
above
the
green
wave
of
trees
that
broke
round
it
he
could
see
the
towers
of
it
rising
black
against
the
sunset
and
between
the
trees
came
glimpses
of
its
marble
white
where
the
faint
grey
light
touched
it
from
the
east
moving
slowly
vigilant
alert
with
eyes
turning
always
to
right
and
to
left
with
ears
which
felt
the
intense
silence
more
acutely
than
they
could
have
felt
any
tumult
the
thief
reached
the
low
wall
of
the
garden
at
the
western
side
the
last
redness
of
the
sunset
reflection
had
lighted
all
the
many
windows
and
the
vast
place
blazed
at
him
for
an
instant
before
the
light
dipped
behind
the
black
bar
of
the
trees
and
left
him
face
to
face
with
a
pale
house
whose
windows
now
were
black
and
hollow
and
seemed
like
eyes
that
watched
him
every
window
was
closed
the
lower
ones
were
guarded
by
jalousies
through
the
glass
of
the
ones
above
he
could
see
the
set
painted
faces
of
the
shutters
from
far
off
he
had
heard
and
known
the
of
fountains
and
now
he
saw
their
white
changing
columns
rise
and
fall
against
the
background
of
the
terrace
the
garden
was
full
of
rose
bushes
trailing
and
unpruned
and
the
heavy
happy
scent
of
the
roses
still
warm
from
the
sun
breathed
through
the
place
exaggerating
the
sadness
of
its
tangled
desolation
strange
figures
gleamed
in
the
deepening
dusk
but
they
were
too
white
to
be
feared
he
crept
into
a
corner
where
psyche
drooped
in
marble
and
behind
her
pedestal
crouched
he
took
food
from
his
pockets
and
ate
and
drank
and
between
the
mouthfuls
he
listened
and
watched
the
moon
rose
and
struck
a
pale
fire
from
the
face
of
the
house
and
from
the
marble
limbs
of
the
statues
and
the
gleaming
water
of
the
fountains
drew
the
moonbeams
into
the
unchanging
change
of
its
rise
and
fall
something
rustled
and
stirred
among
the
roses
the
thief
grew
rigid
his
heart
seemed
suddenly
hollow
he
held
his
breath
through
the
deepening
shadows
something
gleamed
white
and
not
marble
for
it
moved
it
came
towards
him
then
the
silence
of
the
night
was
shattered
by
a
scream
as
the
white
shape
glided
into
the
moonlight
the
thief
resumed
his
munching
and
another
shape
glimmered
after
the
first
curse
the
beasts
he
said
and
took
another
draught
from
his
bottle
as
the
white
peacocks
were
blotted
out
by
the
shadows
of
the
trees
and
the
stillness
of
the
night
grew
more
intense
in
the
moonlight
the
thief
went
round
and
about
the
house
pushing
through
the
trailing
briers
that
clung
to
him
and
now
grown
bolder
he
looked
closely
at
doors
and
windows
but
all
were
fast
barred
as
the
doors
of
a
tomb
and
the
silence
deepened
as
the
moonlight
waxed
there
was
one
little
window
high
up
that
showed
no
shutter
he
looked
at
it
measured
its
distance
from
the
ground
and
from
the
nearest
of
the
great
chestnut
trees
then
he
walked
along
under
the
avenue
of
chestnuts
with
head
thrown
back
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
mystery
of
their
interlacing
branches
at
the
fifth
tree
he
stopped
leaped
to
the
lowest
bough
missed
it
leaped
again
caught
it
and
drew
up
his
body
then
climbing
creeping
swinging
while
the
leaves
agitated
by
his
progress
rustled
to
the
bending
of
the
boughs
he
passed
to
that
tree
to
the
next
swift
assured
unhesitating
and
so
from
tree
to
tree
till
he
was
at
the
last
tree
and
on
the
bough
that
stretched
to
touch
the
little
window
with
its
leaves
he
swung
from
this
the
bough
bent
and
cracked
and
would
have
broken
but
that
at
the
only
possible
instant
the
thief
swung
forward
felt
the
edge
of
the
window
with
his
feet
loosed
the
bough
sprang
and
stood
flattened
against
the
mouldings
clutching
the
carved
with
his
hands
he
thrust
his
knee
through
the
window
waiting
for
the
tinkle
of
the
falling
glass
to
settle
into
quietness
opened
the
window
and
crept
in
he
found
himself
in
a
corridor
he
could
see
the
long
line
of
its
white
windows
and
the
bars
of
moonlight
falling
across
the
inlaid
wood
of
its
floor
he
took
out
his
thief
lantern
high
and
slender
like
a
tall
cup
lighted
it
and
crept
softly
along
the
corridor
listening
between
his
steps
till
the
silence
grew
to
be
like
a
humming
in
his
ears
and
slowly
stealthily
he
opened
door
after
door
the
rooms
were
spacious
and
empty
his
lantern
yellow
light
flashing
into
their
corners
told
him
this
some
poor
plain
furniture
he
discerned
a
curtain
or
a
bench
here
and
there
but
not
what
he
sought
so
large
was
the
house
that
presently
it
seemed
to
the
thief
that
for
many
hours
he
had
been
wandering
along
its
galleries
creeping
down
its
wide
stairs
opening
the
grudging
doors
of
the
dark
empty
rooms
whose
silence
spoke
ever
more
insistently
in
his
ears
but
it
is
as
he
told
me
he
said
inwardly
no
living
soul
in
all
the
place
the
old
man
a
servant
of
this
great
house
he
told
me
he
knew
and
i
have
found
all
even
as
he
said
then
the
thief
turned
away
from
the
arched
emptiness
of
the
grand
staircase
and
in
a
far
corner
of
the
hall
he
found
himself
speaking
in
a
whisper
because
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
nothing
would
serve
but
that
this
clamorous
silence
should
be
stilled
by
a
human
voice
the
old
man
said
it
would
be
thus
all
emptiness
and
not
profit
to
a
man
and
he
died
and
i
tended
him
dear
jesus
how
our
good
deeds
come
home
to
us
and
he
told
me
how
the
last
of
the
great
family
had
gone
away
none
knew
whither
and
the
tales
i
heard
in
the
town
how
the
great
man
had
not
gone
but
lived
here
in
hiding
it
is
not
possible
there
is
the
silence
of
death
in
this
house
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
the
stillness
of
the
place
seemed
to
press
upon
him
like
a
solid
thing
it
is
like
a
dead
man
on
shoulders
thought
the
thief
and
he
straightened
himself
up
and
whispered
again
the
old
man
said
door
with
the
carved
griffin
and
the
roses
enwreathed
and
the
seventh
rose
holds
the
secret
in
its
heart
with
that
the
thief
set
forth
again
creeping
softly
across
the
bars
of
moonlight
down
the
corridor
and
after
much
seeking
he
found
at
last
under
the
angle
of
the
great
stone
staircase
behind
a
mouldering
tapestry
wrought
with
peacocks
and
pines
a
door
and
on
it
carved
a
griffin
wreathed
about
with
roses
he
pressed
his
finger
into
the
deep
heart
of
each
carven
rose
and
when
he
pressed
the
rose
that
was
seventh
in
number
from
the
griffin
he
felt
the
inmost
part
of
it
move
beneath
his
finger
as
though
it
sought
to
escape
so
he
pressed
more
strongly
leaning
against
the
door
till
it
swung
open
and
he
passed
through
it
looking
behind
him
to
see
that
nothing
followed
the
door
he
closed
as
he
entered
and
now
he
was
as
it
seemed
in
some
other
house
the
chambers
were
large
and
lofty
as
those
whose
hushed
emptiness
he
had
explored
but
these
rooms
seemed
warm
with
life
yet
held
no
threat
no
terror
to
the
dim
yellow
flicker
from
the
lantern
came
out
of
the
darkness
hints
of
a
crowded
magnificence
a
lavish
profusion
of
beautiful
objects
such
as
he
had
never
in
his
life
dreamed
of
though
all
that
life
had
been
one
dream
of
the
lovely
treasures
which
rich
men
hoard
and
which
by
the
thief
skill
and
craft
may
come
to
be
his
he
passed
through
the
rooms
turning
the
light
of
his
lantern
this
way
and
that
and
ever
the
darkness
withheld
more
than
the
light
revealed
he
knew
that
thick
tapestries
hung
from
the
walls
velvet
curtains
masked
the
windows
his
hand
exploring
eagerly
felt
the
rich
carving
of
chairs
and
presses
the
great
beds
were
hung
with
silken
cloth
wrought
in
gold
thread
with
glimmering
strange
starry
devices
broad
sideboards
flashed
back
to
his
lantern
questionings
the
faint
white
laugh
of
silver
the
tall
cabinets
could
not
with
all
their
reserve
suppress
the
confession
of
wrought
gold
and
from
the
caskets
into
whose
depths
he
flashed
the
light
came
the
trembling
avowal
of
rich
jewels
and
now
at
last
that
carved
door
closed
between
him
and
the
poignant
silence
of
the
deserted
corridors
the
thief
felt
a
sudden
gaiety
of
heart
a
sense
of
escape
of
security
he
was
alone
yet
warmed
and
companioned
the
silence
here
was
no
longer
a
horror
but
a
consoler
a
friend
and
indeed
now
he
was
not
alone
the
ample
splendours
about
him
the
spoils
which
long
centuries
had
yielded
to
the
grasp
of
a
noble
family
these
were
companions
after
his
own
heart
he
flung
open
the
shade
of
his
lantern
and
held
it
high
above
his
head
the
room
still
kept
half
its
secrets
the
discretion
of
the
darkness
should
be
broken
down
he
must
see
more
of
this
splendour
not
in
unsatisfying
dim
detail
but
in
the
lit
gorgeous
mass
of
it
the
narrow
bar
of
the
lantern
light
chafed
him
he
sprang
on
to
the
and
began
to
light
the
chandelier
there
were
a
hundred
candles
and
he
lighted
all
so
that
the
chandelier
swung
like
a
vast
living
jewel
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
then
as
he
turned
all
the
colour
in
the
room
leapt
out
at
him
the
purple
of
the
couches
the
green
gleam
of
the
delicate
glass
the
blue
of
the
tapestries
and
the
vivid
scarlet
of
the
velvet
hangings
and
with
the
colour
sprang
the
gleams
of
white
from
the
silver
of
yellow
from
the
gold
of
fire
from
strange
inlaid
work
and
jewelled
caskets
till
the
thief
stood
aghast
with
rapture
in
the
strange
sudden
revelation
of
this
concentrated
splendour
he
went
along
the
walls
with
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
the
wax
dripped
warm
over
his
fingers
as
he
went
lighting
one
after
another
the
tapers
in
the
sconces
of
the
glasses
in
the
state
bedchamber
he
drew
back
suddenly
face
to
face
with
a
countenance
in
which
black
eyes
blazed
at
him
with
triumph
and
delight
then
he
laughed
aloud
he
had
not
known
his
own
face
in
the
strange
depths
of
this
mirror
it
had
no
sconces
like
the
others
or
he
would
have
known
it
for
what
it
was
it
was
framed
in
venice
glass
wonderful
gleaming
iridescent
the
thief
dropped
the
candle
and
threw
his
arms
wide
with
a
gesture
of
supreme
longing
if
i
could
carry
it
all
away
all
all
every
beautiful
thing
to
sell
some
the
less
beautiful
and
to
live
with
the
others
all
my
days
and
now
a
madness
came
over
the
thief
so
little
a
part
of
all
these
things
could
he
bear
away
with
him
yet
all
were
his
his
for
the
taking
even
the
huge
carved
presses
and
the
enormous
vases
of
solid
silver
too
heavy
for
him
to
lift
even
these
were
his
had
he
not
found
them
he
by
his
own
skill
and
cunning
he
went
about
in
the
rooms
touching
one
after
the
other
the
beautiful
rare
things
he
caressed
the
gold
and
the
jewels
he
threw
his
arms
round
the
great
silver
vases
he
wound
round
himself
the
heavy
red
velvet
of
the
curtain
where
the
griffins
gleamed
in
embossed
gold
and
shivered
with
pleasure
at
the
soft
clinging
of
its
embrace
he
found
in
a
tall
cupboard
flasks
of
wine
such
wine
as
he
had
never
tasted
and
he
drank
of
it
slowly
in
little
sips
from
a
silver
goblet
and
from
a
green
venice
glass
and
from
a
cup
of
rare
pink
china
knowing
that
any
one
of
his
drinking
vessels
was
worth
enough
to
keep
him
in
idleness
for
a
long
year
for
the
thief
had
learnt
his
trade
and
it
is
a
part
of
a
thief
trade
to
know
the
value
of
things
he
threw
himself
on
the
rich
couches
sat
in
the
stately
carved
chairs
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
ebony
tables
he
buried
his
hot
face
in
the
chill
smooth
linen
of
the
great
bed
and
wondered
to
find
it
still
scented
delicately
as
though
some
sweet
woman
had
lain
there
but
last
night
he
went
hither
and
thither
laughing
with
pure
pleasure
and
making
to
himself
an
unbridled
carnival
of
the
joys
of
possession
in
this
wise
the
night
wore
on
and
with
the
night
his
madness
wore
away
so
presently
he
went
about
among
the
treasures
no
more
with
the
eyes
of
a
lover
but
with
the
eyes
of
a
jew
and
he
chose
those
precious
stones
which
he
knew
for
the
most
precious
and
put
them
in
the
bag
he
had
brought
and
with
them
some
goldsmith
work
and
the
goblet
out
of
which
he
had
drunk
the
wine
though
it
was
but
of
silver
he
would
not
leave
it
the
green
venice
glass
he
broke
and
the
cup
for
he
said
no
man
less
fortunate
than
i
shall
ever
again
drink
from
them
but
he
harmed
nothing
else
of
all
the
beautiful
things
because
he
loved
them
then
leaving
the
low
uneven
ends
of
the
candles
still
alight
he
turned
to
the
door
by
which
he
had
come
in
there
were
two
doors
side
by
side
carved
with
straight
lilies
and
between
them
a
panel
wrought
with
the
griffin
and
the
seven
roses
enwreathed
he
pressed
his
finger
in
the
heart
of
the
seventh
rose
hardly
hoping
that
the
panel
would
move
and
indeed
it
did
not
and
he
was
about
to
seek
for
a
secret
spring
among
the
lilies
when
he
perceived
that
one
of
the
doors
wrought
with
these
had
opened
itself
a
little
so
he
passed
through
it
and
closed
it
after
him
i
must
guard
my
treasures
he
said
but
when
he
had
passed
through
the
door
and
closed
it
and
put
out
his
hand
to
raise
the
tattered
tapestry
that
covered
it
from
without
his
hand
met
the
empty
air
and
he
knew
that
he
had
not
come
out
by
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
when
the
lantern
was
lighted
it
showed
him
a
vaulted
passage
whose
floor
and
whose
walls
were
stone
and
there
was
a
damp
air
and
a
mouldering
scent
in
it
as
of
a
cellar
long
unopened
he
was
cold
now
and
the
room
with
the
wine
and
the
treasures
seemed
long
ago
and
far
away
though
but
a
door
and
a
moment
divided
him
from
it
and
though
some
of
the
wine
was
in
his
body
and
some
of
the
treasure
in
his
hands
he
set
about
to
find
the
way
to
the
quiet
night
outside
for
this
seemed
to
him
a
haven
and
a
safeguard
since
with
the
closing
of
that
door
he
had
shut
away
warmth
and
light
and
companionship
he
was
enclosed
in
walls
once
more
and
once
more
menaced
by
the
invading
silence
that
was
almost
a
presence
once
more
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
must
creep
softly
must
hold
his
breath
before
he
ventured
to
turn
a
corner
for
always
he
felt
that
he
was
not
alone
that
near
him
was
something
and
that
its
breath
too
was
held
so
he
went
by
many
passages
and
stairways
and
could
find
no
way
out
and
after
a
long
time
of
searching
he
crept
by
another
way
back
to
come
unawares
on
the
door
which
shut
him
off
from
the
room
where
the
many
lights
were
and
the
wine
and
the
treasure
then
terror
leaped
out
upon
him
from
the
dark
hush
of
the
place
and
he
beat
on
the
door
with
his
hands
and
cried
aloud
till
the
echo
of
his
cry
in
the
groined
roof
cowed
him
back
into
silence
again
he
crept
stealthily
by
strange
passages
and
again
could
find
no
way
except
after
much
wandering
back
to
the
door
where
he
had
begun
and
now
the
fear
of
death
beat
in
his
brain
with
blows
like
a
hammer
to
die
here
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
never
to
see
the
sun
alight
again
never
to
climb
in
at
a
window
or
see
brave
jewels
shine
under
his
lantern
but
to
wander
and
wander
and
wander
between
these
inexorable
walls
till
he
died
and
the
rats
admitting
him
to
their
brotherhood
swarmed
round
the
dead
body
of
him
i
had
better
have
been
born
a
fool
said
the
thief
then
once
more
he
went
through
the
damp
and
the
blackness
of
the
vaulted
passages
tremulously
searching
for
some
outlet
but
in
vain
only
at
last
in
a
corner
behind
a
pillar
he
found
a
very
little
door
and
a
stair
that
led
down
so
he
followed
it
to
wander
among
other
corridors
and
cellars
with
the
silence
heavy
about
him
and
despair
growing
thick
and
cold
like
a
fungus
about
his
heart
and
in
his
brain
the
fear
of
death
beating
like
a
hammer
it
was
quite
suddenly
in
his
wanderings
which
had
grown
into
an
aimless
frenzy
having
now
less
of
search
in
it
than
of
flight
from
the
insistent
silence
that
he
saw
at
last
a
light
and
it
was
the
light
of
day
coming
through
an
open
door
he
stood
at
the
door
and
breathed
the
air
of
the
morning
the
sun
had
risen
and
touched
the
tops
of
the
towers
of
the
house
with
white
radiance
the
birds
were
singing
loudly
it
was
morning
then
and
he
was
a
free
man
he
looked
about
him
for
a
way
to
come
at
the
park
and
thence
to
the
broken
wall
and
the
white
road
which
he
had
come
by
a
very
long
time
before
for
this
door
opened
on
an
inner
enclosed
courtyard
still
in
damp
shadow
though
the
sun
above
struck
level
across
it
a
courtyard
where
tall
weeds
grew
thick
and
dank
the
dew
of
the
night
was
heavy
on
them
as
he
stood
and
looked
he
was
aware
of
a
low
buzzing
sound
that
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
courtyard
he
pushed
through
the
weeds
towards
it
and
the
sense
of
a
presence
in
the
silence
came
upon
him
more
than
ever
it
had
done
in
the
darkened
house
though
now
it
was
day
and
the
birds
sang
all
gaily
and
the
good
sun
shone
so
bravely
overhead
as
he
thrust
aside
the
weeds
which
grew
he
trod
on
something
that
seemed
to
writhe
under
his
feet
like
a
snake
he
started
back
and
looked
down
it
was
the
long
firm
heavy
plait
of
a
woman
hair
and
just
beyond
lay
the
green
gown
of
a
woman
and
a
woman
hands
and
her
golden
head
and
her
eyes
all
about
the
place
where
she
lay
was
the
thick
buzzing
of
flies
and
the
black
swarming
of
them
the
thief
saw
and
he
turned
and
he
fled
back
to
his
doorway
and
down
the
steps
and
through
the
maze
of
vaulted
passages
fled
in
the
dark
and
because
when
he
had
come
into
the
presence
that
informed
that
house
with
silence
he
had
dropped
lantern
and
treasure
and
fled
wildly
the
horror
in
his
soul
driving
him
before
it
now
fear
is
more
wise
than
cunning
so
whereas
he
had
sought
for
hours
with
his
lantern
and
with
all
his
thief
craft
to
find
the
way
out
and
had
sought
in
vain
he
now
in
the
dark
and
blindly
without
thought
or
will
without
pause
or
let
found
the
one
way
that
led
to
a
door
shot
back
the
bolts
and
fled
through
the
awakened
rose
garden
and
across
the
dewy
park
he
dropped
from
the
wall
into
the
road
and
stood
there
looking
eagerly
to
right
and
left
to
the
right
the
road
wound
white
and
sinuous
like
a
twisted
ribbon
over
the
great
grey
shoulder
of
the
hill
to
the
left
the
road
curved
down
towards
the
river
no
least
black
fly
of
a
figure
stirred
on
it
there
are
no
travellers
on
such
a
road
at
such
an
hour
xi
the
girl
at
the
john
selwyn
selborne
cursed
for
the
hundredth
time
the
fool
that
had
bound
him
captive
at
the
chariot
wheels
of
beauty
that
is
to
say
he
cursed
the
fool
he
had
been
to
trust
himself
in
the
automobile
of
that
brydges
woman
the
brydges
woman
was
pretty
rich
and
charming
omniscience
was
her
pose
she
knew
everything
consequently
she
knew
how
to
drive
a
she
learned
the
lesson
of
her
own
incompetence
at
the
price
of
a
broken
ankle
and
a
complete
suit
of
bruises
selborne
paid
for
his
trusting
folly
with
a
broken
and
a
deep
cut
on
his
arm
that
was
why
he
could
not
go
to
portsmouth
to
see
the
last
of
his
young
brother
when
he
left
home
for
the
wars
this
was
why
he
cursed
the
curse
was
mild
it
was
indeed
less
a
curse
than
an
invocation
defend
us
from
women
he
said
above
all
from
the
women
who
think
they
know
the
grey
gloom
that
stood
for
dawn
that
day
crept
through
the
curtains
and
made
ghosts
of
the
shadows
that
lingered
still
in
his
room
he
stretched
himself
wearily
and
groaned
as
the
stretched
nerves
vibrated
to
the
chord
of
agony
there
no
fool
like
an
old
fool
said
john
selwyn
selborne
he
had
years
and
they
weighed
on
him
as
the
when
their
time
came
would
not
do
he
had
said
to
the
young
brother
the
night
before
here
in
this
country
inn
the
nearest
to
the
scene
of
the
enlightenment
of
the
brydges
woman
and
the
boy
sailed
john
selborne
sighed
and
off
to
the
wars
whereas
he
had
been
invalided
at
the
very
beginning
of
things
and
now
when
he
was
well
and
just
on
the
point
of
rejoining
the
and
the
brydges
woman
and
as
for
the
brydges
woman
again
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
there
was
full
sunshine
and
an
orchestra
of
awakened
birds
in
the
garden
outside
there
was
tea
there
were
letters
one
was
from
sidney
sidney
who
had
left
him
not
twelve
hours
before
he
tore
it
open
and
hurt
his
shoulder
in
the
movement
dear
john
said
the
letter
i
wanted
to
tell
you
last
night
but
you
seemed
so
cheap
i
thought
i
better
not
bother
you
but
it
just
come
into
my
head
that
perhaps
i
may
get
a
bullet
in
my
innards
and
i
want
you
to
know
so
here
goes
there
a
girl
i
mean
to
marry
i
know
she
say
yes
but
i
ca
ask
her
till
i
come
back
of
course
i
do
want
to
have
any
humbug
or
concealing
things
from
you
you
always
been
so
decent
to
me
i
know
you
hate
jaw
so
i
wo
go
on
about
that
but
i
must
tell
you
i
met
her
first
when
she
was
serving
in
a
tobacconist
shop
and
her
mother
lets
lodgings
you
think
this
means
she
beneath
me
wait
till
you
see
her
i
want
you
to
see
her
and
make
friends
with
her
while
i
away
here
followed
some
lover
raptures
and
the
address
of
the
lady
john
selborne
lay
back
and
groaned
susannah
sheepmarsh
tobacconist
assistant
daughter
and
sidney
selborne
younger
son
of
a
house
whose
pride
was
that
it
had
been
proud
enough
to
refuse
a
peerage
john
selborne
thought
long
and
deeply
i
suppose
i
must
sacrifice
myself
he
said
little
adventuress
easy
to
prove
to
him
i
said
an
eagle
the
game
her
pride
prefers
though
she
stoops
to
a
wren
instead
the
boy
hate
me
for
a
bit
but
he
thank
me
later
yalding
that
somewhere
on
the
medway
fishing
boating
convalescence
is
good
enough
fiction
aid
us
what
would
the
villain
in
a
book
do
to
come
between
fond
lovers
he
would
take
the
lodgings
at
least
he
would
try
and
one
may
as
well
do
something
so
he
wrote
to
mrs
sheepmarsh
she
had
rooms
to
let
he
heard
terms
and
mrs
sheepmarsh
wrote
back
at
least
her
reply
was
typewritten
which
was
a
bit
of
a
shock
she
had
rooms
they
were
disengaged
and
the
terms
were
thus
and
such
behold
john
selwyn
selborne
then
his
baggage
neatly
labelled
with
his
first
and
second
names
set
down
on
the
little
platform
of
yalding
station
behold
him
crossing
the
old
stone
bridge
and
the
golden
glory
of
the
leas
flushed
with
sunset
mrs
sheepmarsh
house
was
long
and
low
and
white
it
had
a
classic
porch
and
at
one
end
a
french
window
opened
through
cascades
of
jasmine
to
a
long
lawn
there
were
many
trees
a
lady
in
decent
black
with
a
white
cap
and
white
lace
about
her
neck
greeted
him
with
formal
courtesy
this
way
she
said
and
moved
for
him
to
follow
her
through
a
green
gate
and
down
a
shrubbery
that
led
without
disguise
or
pretence
straight
away
from
the
house
it
led
also
to
a
little
white
building
embowered
in
trees
here
said
the
lady
she
opened
the
door
i
tell
the
man
to
bring
your
luggage
good
evening
and
she
left
him
planted
there
he
had
to
bend
his
head
to
pass
under
the
low
door
and
he
found
himself
in
a
tiny
kitchen
beyond
were
a
and
two
bedchambers
all
fitted
sparsely
but
with
old
furniture
curtains
quiet
and
pleasant
to
look
upon
there
were
roses
in
a
jug
of
grès
de
flandre
on
the
in
the
what
a
singular
little
place
he
said
so
these
are
the
lodgings
i
feel
like
a
dog
in
a
kennel
i
suppose
they
will
throw
me
a
bone
or
at
any
rate
ask
me
what
kind
of
bones
i
prefer
he
unpacked
his
clothes
and
laid
his
belongings
in
the
drawers
and
cupboards
it
was
oddly
charming
that
each
shelf
or
drawer
should
have
its
own
little
muslin
bag
of
grey
lavender
then
he
took
up
a
book
and
began
to
read
the
sunset
had
died
away
the
daylight
seemed
to
be
glowing
out
of
the
low
window
like
a
tide
leaving
bare
breadths
of
darkness
behind
he
lighted
candles
he
was
growing
hungry
it
was
past
eight
i
believe
the
old
lady
has
forgotten
my
existence
he
said
and
therewith
opened
his
cottage
door
and
went
out
into
the
lighter
twilight
of
the
garden
the
shrubbery
walks
were
winding
he
took
the
wrong
turning
and
found
himself
entering
on
the
narrow
lawn
from
the
french
window
among
the
jasmine
came
lamplight
and
voices
no
servant
no
food
my
good
mother
you
entertained
a
lunatic
unawares
he
had
references
man
can
not
live
by
references
alone
the
poor
brute
must
be
starving
unless
he
drunk
celia
i
do
wish
you
would
john
selborne
hastening
by
put
a
period
to
the
conversation
by
boots
crunching
heavily
and
conscientiously
on
the
gravel
both
voices
ceased
he
presented
himself
at
the
oblong
of
the
window
within
that
lamplight
glowed
on
the
last
remnants
of
a
meal
dinner
by
the
glasses
and
the
fruit
also
on
the
lady
in
the
cap
and
on
a
girl
the
one
doubtless
who
had
evolved
the
lunatic
idea
both
faces
were
turned
towards
him
both
women
rose
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
advance
he
murmured
something
about
intrusion
awfully
sorry
the
walks
wind
so
and
turned
to
go
but
the
girl
spoke
oh
wait
a
moment
is
this
mr
selwyn
mother
my
daughter
miss
sheepmarsh
mr
selwyn
said
the
mother
reluctantly
we
were
just
talking
about
you
said
the
girl
and
wondering
whether
you
were
ill
or
anything
or
whether
your
servant
has
turned
up
or
something
miss
sheepmarsh
he
was
still
speechless
this
the
little
adventuress
the
tobacconist
assistant
this
girl
with
the
glorious
hair
severely
braided
the
round
face
the
proud
chin
the
most
honest
eyes
in
the
world
she
might
be
sister
to
the
adventuress
cousin
perhaps
but
the
room
too
shining
mahogany
old
china
worn
silver
and
fine
napery
all
spoke
of
a
luxury
as
temperate
as
refined
the
luxury
of
delicate
custom
of
habit
bred
in
the
bone
no
mushroom
growth
of
gross
but
the
unconscious
outcome
of
generations
of
clear
can
we
send
anything
over
for
you
the
elder
lady
asked
of
course
we
we
did
mean
by
private
that
we
would
let
our
tenant
starve
the
girl
interrupted
there
is
some
mistake
selborne
came
to
himself
suddenly
i
thought
i
was
engaging
furnished
apartments
with
er
attendance
the
girl
drew
a
journal
from
a
heap
on
the
sofa
this
was
the
advertisement
was
it
she
asked
and
he
read
cottage
furnished
in
beautiful
grounds
part
of
these
are
fenced
in
for
use
of
tenant
of
cottage
and
in
the
absence
of
the
family
the
whole
of
the
grounds
are
open
to
tenant
when
at
home
the
family
wish
to
be
entirely
private
i
never
saw
this
at
all
said
selborne
desperately
my
i
mean
i
was
told
it
was
furnished
lodgings
i
am
very
sorry
i
have
no
servant
and
no
means
of
getting
one
i
will
go
back
to
london
at
once
i
am
sorry
the
last
train
gone
said
miss
sheepmarsh
mother
ask
mr
selborne
to
come
in
and
i
get
him
something
to
eat
my
dear
said
the
mother
surely
mary
my
dear
mother
said
the
girl
you
know
mary
is
having
her
supper
the
bewildered
selborne
presently
found
himself
seated
at
the
table
served
with
food
and
drink
by
this
hebe
with
the
honest
eyes
he
exerted
himself
to
talk
with
the
mother
not
of
the
difference
between
a
lodger
and
a
tenant
but
of
music
art
and
the
life
of
the
great
world
it
was
the
girl
who
brought
the
conversation
down
from
the
gossip
of
courts
and
to
the
tenant
immediate
needs
if
you
mean
to
stay
you
could
have
a
woman
in
from
the
village
said
she
but
would
you
rather
i
went
he
said
why
should
we
we
want
to
let
the
cottage
or
we
should
have
advertised
it
i
get
you
some
one
mrs
bates
would
be
the
very
thing
mother
and
you
like
her
mr
selwyn
she
a
great
dear
sure
enough
the
next
morning
brought
a
gentle
woman
to
do
for
mr
selwyn
and
she
did
excellently
and
three
slow
days
passed
he
got
a
boat
and
pulled
up
and
down
the
green
river
he
tried
to
fish
he
read
somewhat
and
he
thought
more
and
he
went
in
and
out
of
his
cottage
which
had
its
own
private
path
debouching
on
the
highway
many
times
a
day
he
went
in
and
out
but
he
saw
no
more
the
red
hair
the
round
face
and
the
honest
eyes
on
the
fourth
day
he
had
nursed
his
interest
in
the
girl
to
a
strong
sentiment
of
curiosity
and
attraction
coming
in
at
his
own
gate
he
saw
the
mother
leaving
hers
with
sunshade
and
cardcase
an
afternoon
of
calls
evidently
setting
in
now
or
never
the
swift
impulse
took
him
and
before
he
had
time
to
recall
the
terms
of
that
advertisement
he
had
passed
the
green
fence
of
division
and
his
feet
were
on
the
wandering
ways
of
the
shrubbery
he
felt
as
he
went
a
glow
of
gratitude
to
the
fate
which
was
rewarding
his
care
of
his
brother
future
with
an
interest
like
this
the
adventuress
the
tobacconist
assistant
he
could
deal
with
her
later
through
the
garden
green
a
gleam
of
white
guided
even
it
seemed
beckoned
he
found
the
girl
with
the
red
hair
and
the
honest
eyes
in
a
hammock
swung
between
two
cedars
have
pity
on
me
he
said
abruptly
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
book
oh
it
you
she
said
i
am
so
glad
get
a
chair
from
under
the
weeping
ash
and
sit
down
and
talk
this
turf
is
good
enough
for
me
said
he
but
are
you
sure
i
not
trespassing
you
mean
the
advertisement
oh
that
was
just
because
we
had
some
rather
awful
people
last
year
and
we
could
get
away
from
them
and
mother
wanted
to
be
quite
safe
but
of
course
you
different
we
like
you
very
much
what
we
seen
of
you
this
straightforward
compliment
somehow
pleased
him
less
than
it
might
have
done
the
other
people
were
well
he
was
a
butterman
i
believe
he
called
himself
an
artist
do
you
mean
that
you
do
not
like
persons
who
are
in
trade
he
asked
thinking
of
the
tobacconist
assistant
of
course
i
do
mean
that
she
said
why
i
a
socialist
butterman
just
means
a
person
without
manners
or
ideals
but
i
do
like
working
people
better
than
shoppy
people
though
i
know
it
wrong
how
can
an
involuntary
liking
or
disliking
be
wrong
he
asked
it
snobbish
do
you
think
we
ought
to
like
people
for
what
they
are
not
for
what
they
have
or
what
they
work
at
if
you
were
so
pretty
and
had
that
delightful
air
of
having
just
embraced
the
social
gospel
you
be
a
prig
he
said
to
himself
to
her
he
said
roughly
speaking
do
you
think
the
conventional
classifications
correspond
fairly
well
with
the
real
ones
no
she
answered
roundly
and
when
the
mother
returned
weary
from
her
calls
she
found
her
tenant
and
her
daughter
still
discussing
the
problems
of
good
and
evil
of
heredity
and
environment
of
social
inequalities
and
the
injustice
of
the
world
the
girl
fought
for
her
views
and
she
fought
fairly
if
fiercely
it
was
the
first
of
many
such
fights
when
he
had
gone
the
mother
protested
dearest
said
the
girl
i
ca
help
it
i
must
live
my
own
life
as
people
say
in
plays
after
all
i
i
always
talked
to
people
if
i
liked
them
even
strangers
in
railway
carriages
and
people
are
wild
beasts
you
know
everything
is
always
all
right
and
this
man
can
talk
he
knows
about
things
and
he
a
gentleman
that
ought
to
satisfy
you
that
and
his
references
do
worry
there
a
darling
just
be
nice
to
him
yourself
he
simply
a
godsend
in
a
place
like
this
he
fall
in
love
with
you
celia
said
the
mother
warningly
not
he
said
the
daughter
but
the
mother
was
right
living
alone
in
the
queer
little
cottage
the
world
his
accustomed
life
the
brydges
woman
all
seemed
very
far
away
miss
sheepmarsh
was
very
near
her
frank
enjoyment
of
his
talk
her
gay
acceptance
of
their
now
almost
constant
companionship
were
things
new
in
his
experience
of
women
and
might
have
warned
him
that
she
at
least
was
they
would
have
done
had
he
ever
faced
the
fact
that
his
own
heart
had
caught
fire
he
bicycled
with
her
along
the
pleasant
kentish
lanes
he
rowed
with
her
on
the
little
river
of
dreams
he
read
to
her
in
the
quiet
of
the
august
garden
he
gave
himself
up
wholly
to
the
pleasure
of
those
hours
that
flew
like
moments
those
days
that
passed
like
hours
they
talked
of
books
and
of
the
heart
of
books
and
inevitably
they
talked
of
themselves
he
talked
of
himself
less
than
most
men
but
he
learned
much
of
her
life
she
was
an
ardent
social
reformer
had
lived
in
an
settlement
in
whitechapel
had
studied
at
the
london
school
of
economics
now
she
had
come
back
to
be
with
her
mother
who
needed
her
she
and
her
mother
were
almost
alone
in
the
world
there
was
enough
to
live
on
but
not
too
much
the
letting
of
the
little
house
had
been
celia
idea
its
rent
was
merely
for
luxuries
he
found
out
from
the
mother
when
she
came
to
tolerate
him
that
the
luxuries
were
celia
the
luxuries
of
helping
the
unfortunate
feeding
the
hungry
and
clothing
little
shivering
children
in
winter
time
and
all
this
while
he
had
not
heard
a
word
of
sister
or
cousin
of
any
one
whom
he
might
identify
as
the
tobacconist
assistant
it
was
on
an
evening
when
the
level
sunbeams
turned
the
meadows
by
the
riverside
to
fine
gold
and
the
willows
and
alders
to
trees
of
paradise
that
he
spoke
suddenly
leaning
forward
on
his
sculls
have
you
he
asked
looking
into
her
face
any
relation
who
is
in
a
shop
no
said
she
why
i
only
wondered
said
he
coldly
but
what
an
extraordinary
thing
to
wonder
she
said
do
tell
me
what
made
you
think
of
it
very
well
he
said
i
will
the
person
who
told
me
that
your
mother
had
lodgings
also
told
me
that
your
mother
had
a
daughter
who
served
in
a
shop
never
she
cried
what
a
hateful
idea
a
tobacconist
shop
he
persisted
and
her
name
was
susannah
sheepmarsh
oh
she
answered
that
was
me
she
spoke
instantly
and
frankly
but
she
blushed
crimson
and
you
ashamed
of
it
socialist
he
asked
with
a
sneer
and
his
eyes
were
fierce
on
her
burning
face
i
not
row
home
please
or
i
take
the
sculls
if
you
tired
or
your
shoulder
hurts
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
any
more
you
tried
to
trap
me
into
telling
a
lie
you
do
understand
anything
at
all
and
i
never
forgive
you
yes
you
will
he
said
to
himself
again
and
again
through
the
silence
in
which
they
plashed
down
the
river
but
when
he
was
alone
in
his
cottage
the
truth
flew
at
him
and
grappled
him
with
teeth
and
claws
he
loved
her
she
loved
or
had
loved
or
might
have
loved
or
might
love
his
brother
he
must
go
and
the
next
morning
he
went
without
a
word
he
left
a
note
for
mrs
sheepmarsh
and
a
cheque
in
lieu
of
notice
and
letter
and
cheque
were
signed
with
his
name
in
full
he
went
back
to
the
old
life
but
the
taste
of
it
all
was
gone
shooting
parties
house
parties
the
brydges
woman
even
prettier
than
ever
and
surer
of
all
things
how
could
these
charm
one
whose
fancy
whose
heart
indeed
wandered
for
ever
in
a
green
garden
or
by
a
quiet
river
with
a
young
woman
who
had
served
in
a
tobacconist
shop
and
who
would
be
some
day
his
brother
wife
the
days
were
long
the
weeks
seemed
interminable
and
all
the
time
there
was
the
white
house
as
it
had
been
there
were
mother
and
daughter
living
the
same
dainty
dignified
charming
life
to
which
he
had
come
so
near
why
had
he
ever
gone
there
why
had
he
ever
interfered
he
had
meant
to
ensnare
her
heart
just
to
free
his
brother
from
an
adventuress
an
adventuress
he
groaned
aloud
oh
fool
but
you
are
punished
he
said
she
angry
now
angrier
even
than
that
evening
on
the
river
for
she
knows
now
that
even
the
name
you
gave
her
to
call
you
by
was
not
the
one
your
own
people
use
this
comes
of
trying
to
act
like
an
ass
in
a
book
the
months
went
on
the
brydges
woman
rallied
him
on
his
absent
air
she
spoke
of
dairymaids
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
found
her
amusing
and
whether
her
vulgarity
was
a
growth
or
had
been
merely
hidden
and
all
the
time
celia
and
the
white
house
were
dragging
at
his
enough
was
left
of
the
fool
that
he
constantly
reproached
himself
for
having
been
to
make
him
sure
that
had
he
had
no
brother
had
he
met
her
with
no
duty
to
the
absent
to
stand
between
them
she
would
have
loved
him
then
one
day
came
the
south
african
mail
and
it
brought
a
letter
from
his
brother
the
lad
who
had
had
the
sense
to
find
a
jewel
behind
a
tobacconist
counter
and
had
trusted
it
to
him
the
letter
was
long
and
ineffective
it
was
the
postscript
that
was
vital
i
say
i
wonder
whether
you
seen
anything
of
susannah
what
a
young
fool
i
was
ever
to
think
i
could
be
happy
with
a
girl
out
of
a
shop
i
met
the
real
and
only
one
now
she
a
nurse
her
father
was
a
clergyman
in
northumberland
she
such
a
bright
little
thing
and
she
never
cared
for
any
one
before
me
wish
me
luck
john
selborne
almost
tore
his
hair
well
i
ca
save
him
across
half
the
world
besides
at
one
should
have
outgrown
the
wild
impulses
of
youth
he
said
this
to
himself
but
all
the
same
it
was
the
next
train
to
yalding
that
he
took
fate
was
kind
at
yalding
it
had
almost
always
been
kind
the
glow
of
red
firelight
shone
out
over
the
snow
through
the
french
window
among
the
brown
jasmine
stalks
mrs
sheepmarsh
was
out
miss
sheepmarsh
was
at
home
would
he
step
this
way
he
stepped
into
the
presence
of
the
girl
she
rose
from
the
low
chair
by
the
fire
and
the
honest
eyes
looked
angrily
at
him
look
here
he
said
as
the
door
closed
between
them
and
the
i
come
to
tell
you
things
just
this
once
let
me
talk
to
you
and
afterwards
if
you
like
i
can
go
away
and
never
come
back
sit
down
she
said
coldly
i
do
feel
friends
with
you
at
all
but
if
you
want
to
speak
i
suppose
you
must
so
then
he
told
her
everything
beginning
with
his
brother
letter
and
ending
with
his
brother
letter
and
of
course
i
thought
it
could
be
you
because
of
your
being
called
celia
and
when
i
found
out
it
really
was
you
i
had
to
go
away
because
i
wanted
to
be
fair
to
the
boy
but
now
i
come
back
i
think
you
the
meanest
person
i
ever
knew
she
said
you
thought
i
liked
your
brother
and
you
tried
to
make
me
like
you
so
that
you
might
throw
me
over
and
show
him
how
worthless
i
was
i
hate
you
and
despise
you
i
did
really
try
he
said
miserably
and
you
took
a
false
name
to
deceive
us
i
did
it
really
is
my
second
name
and
you
came
here
pretending
to
be
nice
and
a
gentleman
and
she
was
lashing
herself
to
rage
with
the
lash
of
her
own
voice
as
women
will
john
selborne
stood
up
suddenly
be
quiet
he
said
and
she
was
quiet
i
wo
hear
any
more
reproaches
unless
listen
i
done
wrong
i
owned
it
suffered
for
it
god
knows
i
suffered
you
liked
me
in
the
summer
ca
you
try
to
like
me
again
i
want
you
more
than
anything
else
in
the
world
will
you
marry
me
marry
you
she
cried
scornfully
you
who
pardon
me
he
said
i
have
asked
a
question
give
me
no
for
an
answer
and
i
will
go
say
yes
and
then
you
may
say
anything
else
you
like
yes
or
no
shall
i
go
or
stay
yes
or
no
no
other
word
will
do
she
looked
at
him
her
head
thrown
back
her
eyes
flashing
with
indignation
a
world
of
scorn
showed
in
the
angle
of
the
chin
the
poise
of
her
head
her
lips
opened
then
suddenly
her
eyes
met
his
and
she
knew
that
he
meant
what
he
said
she
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
do
do
cry
dear
one
he
said
what
is
it
you
only
to
choose
everything
is
for
you
to
decide
still
she
did
not
speak
then
he
said
and
turned
but
she
caught
at
him
blindly
do
do
go
she
cried
i
did
think
i
cared
about
you
in
the
summer
but
since
you
went
away
oh
you
do
know
how
i
wanted
you
well
he
said
when
her
tears
were
dried
are
you
going
to
scold
me
do
said
she
at
least
tell
me
all
about
my
brother
and
why
he
thought
you
would
be
so
ready
to
marry
him
that
oh
that
was
only
his
conceit
you
know
i
always
do
talk
to
people
in
railway
carriages
and
things
i
suppose
he
thought
it
was
only
him
i
talked
to
and
the
name
i
i
thought
if
i
said
my
name
was
susannah
he
would
get
sentimental
you
a
false
name
to
deceive
him
do
oh
do
and
the
tobacco
shop
ah
that
rankles
she
raised
her
head
to
look
at
him
not
it
he
answered
coolly
i
simply
do
believe
it
why
but
you
quite
right
it
was
a
woman
in
my
district
in
london
and
i
took
the
shop
for
her
for
three
days
because
her
husband
was
dying
and
she
could
get
any
one
else
to
help
her
it
was
it
was
rather
fun
and
and
and
you
would
tell
me
about
it
because
you
did
want
me
to
know
how
proud
you
were
of
it
proud
ah
you
do
understand
things
the
man
died
and
i
had
given
her
those
three
days
with
him
i
was
proud
was
i
only
glad
that
i
could
so
glad
so
glad
but
you
let
my
brother
think
oh
yes
i
let
him
think
it
was
my
trade
i
thought
it
might
make
him
not
be
silly
you
see
i
always
knew
he
could
understand
things
celia
yes
and
have
you
really
forgiven

be
accurate

am
going
to
them
i
mean
father

for
a
year
a
whole
year
he
said
looking
down
at
her
fan
what

without
you
london
will
do
excellently
she
answered
and
that
my
pet
fan

being
tied
into
knots
she
took
it
from
him
and

and
rhyme
and
dance
and
dine

to
the
proper
number
of
dinners
and
dances
and
make
the
proper
measure
of
pretty
little
speeches
and
nice
little
phrases
and
you
do
your
reviews
and
try
to
make
them
as
like
your
editor
as
you
can
and
you
turn
out
your
charming
little
rondeaux
and
triolets
and

i
glad
i
going
to
see
something
big
if

atlantic
you

very
cruel
he
said

i
but
it
not
cruel
to
be
cruel
if
nobody
hurt
is
it
and
i
am
so
tired
of
nice
little
verses
and
pretty
little
dances
and
dainty
little
dinners
oh
if
i
were
only
a
man
thank
god
you
not
said
he
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
do
just
one
big
thing
in
my
life
even
if
i
had
to
settle
down
to
a
life
of
snippets
and
trifles
afterwards
her
eyes
were
shining
they
always
glittered
but
now
they
were
starry
the
drifted
white
folds
across
her
breast
stirred
to
her
quickened
breath
if
you
loved
me
sybil
i
could
do
something
great
said
he
but
i
she
said
at
any
rate
not
now
and
i
told
you
so
a
dozen
times
my
dear
rupert
the
man
who
needs
a
woman
to
save
him
worth
the
saving
what
would
you
call
a
big
thing
he
asked
must
i
conquer
an
empire
for
you
or
start
a
new
religion
or
shall
i
merely
get
the
victoria
cross
or
become
prime
minister
do
sneer
said
she
it
does
become
you
at
all
you
no
idea
how
horrid
you
look
when
you
sneering
why
do
you
oh
but
it
no
good
by
the
way
what
a
charming
cover
housman
has
designed
for
your
and
it
a
dear
little
book
some
of
the
verses
are
quite
pretty
go
on
said
he
rub
it
in
i
know
i
have
done
much
yet
but
there
plenty
of
time
and
how
can
one
do
any
good
work
when
one
is
for
ever
sticking
up
one
heart
like
a
beastly
cocoanut
for
you
to
shy
at
if
you
only
marry
me
sybil
you
should
see
how
i
would
work
may
i
refer
you
to
my
speech
not
the
last
one
but
the
one
before
that
he
laughed
then
he
sighed
ah
my
pretty
he
said
it
was
all
very
well
and
pleasant
enough
to
be
scolded
by
you
when
i
could
see
you
every
day
but
now
how
often
she
asked
calmly
have
i
told
you
that
you
must
not
call
me
that
it
was
all
very
well
when
we
were
children
but
now
look
here
he
said
leaning
towards
her
there
not
a
soul
about
they
in
the
middle
of
the
lancers
let
me
kiss
you
once
it
matter
to
you
and
it
will
mean
so
very
much
to
me
that
just
it
she
said
if
it
did
mean
then
it
sha
mean
anything
but
it
only
about
eight
years
since
you
gave
up
the
habit
of
kissing
me
on
every
occasion
she
looked
down
then
she
looked
to
right
and
left
then
suddenly
she
looked
at
him
very
well
she
said
suddenly
no
he
said
i
wo
have
it
unless
it
mean
something
there
was
a
silence
our
dance
i
think
said
the
voice
of
one
bending
before
her
and
she
was
borne
away
on
the
arm
of
the
partner
from
whom
she
had
been
hiding
rupert
left
early
he
had
not
been
able
to
secure
any
more
dances
with
her
she
left
late
when
she
came
to
think
the
evening
over
she
sighed
more
than
once
i
wish
i
loved
him
a
little
less
or
a
little
more
she
said
and
i
wish
yes
i
do
wish
he
had
i
do
suppose
he
care
a
bit
for
me
when
i
come
back
so
she
set
sail
for
the
fortunate
or
other
isles
and
in
dainty
verses
on
loss
and
absence
he
found
some
solace
for
the
pain
of
parting
with
her
yet
the
pain
was
a
real
thing
and
grew
greater
and
life
seemed
to
have
no
taste
even
tobacco
no
charm
she
had
always
been
a
part
of
his
life
since
the
days
when
nothing
but
a
sunk
fence
divided
his
park
from
her
father
he
grew
paler
and
he
developed
a
wrinkle
or
two
and
a
buoyant
friend
meeting
him
in
piccadilly
assured
him
that
he
looked
very
much
off
colour
and
in
his
way
the
friend
advised
the
sort
of
trip
round
the
world
from
which
yesterday
had
seen
his
own
jovial
return
do
you
all
the
good
in
the
world
my
boy
my
soul
you
have
a
tired
sort
of
look
as
if
you
got
some
of
these
jolly
new
diseases
people
have
taken
to
dying
of
lately
you
know
and
things
like
that
you
book
your
passage
to
marseilles
at
once
so
long
you
take
my
tip
what
rupert
took
was
a
cab
he
looked
at
himself
in
one
of
the
little
horseshoe
mirrors
he
certainly
did
look
ill
and
he
felt
ill
tired
bored
and
nothing
seemed
worth
while
he
drove
to
a
doctor
friend
who
punched
and
prodded
him
and
listened
with
tubes
at
his
chest
and
back
looked
grave
and
said
go
to
strongitharm
he
absolutely
at
top
fee
but
it
better
to
know
where
we
are
you
go
to
strongitharm
rupert
went
and
strongitharm
gave
his
opinion
he
gave
it
with
a
voice
that
trembled
with
sympathy
and
he
supplemented
it
with
which
he
happened
to
have
quite
handy
then
rupert
disappeared
from
london
and
from
his
friends
disappeared
suddenly
and
completely
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
no
relations
near
enough
to
be
inconveniently
anxious
he
went
away
and
he
left
no
address
and
he
did
not
even
write
excuses
to
the
people
with
whom
he
should
have
danced
and
dined
nor
to
the
editor
whose
style
he
should
have
gone
on
imitating
the
buoyant
friend
rejoiced
at
the
obvious
and
natural
following
of
his
advice
he
was
looking
a
little
bit
below
himself
you
know
and
i
said
round
the
world
there
nothing
like
it
and
by
jove
he
went
now
that
the
kind
of
man
i
like
knows
good
advice
when
he
gets
it
and
acts
on
it
right
off
so
the
buoyant
one
spread
the
rumour
that
ran
its
course
and
died
and
had
to
be
galvanised
into
life
once
more
to
furnish
an
answer
to
questionings
when
returning
from
the
fortunate
or
other
isles
she
asked
for
news
of
her
old
friend
and
the
rumour
did
not
satisfy
her
she
had
had
time
to
think
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
think
in
those
islands
whose
real
name
escapes
me
and
she
knew
very
much
more
than
she
had
known
on
the
evening
when
rupert
had
broken
her
pet
fan
and
asked
for
a
kiss
which
he
had
not
taken
she
found
herself
quite
fervently
disbelieving
in
the
grand
tour
theory
and
the
disbelief
was
so
strong
that
it
distorted
life
and
made
everything
else
uninteresting
sybil
took
to
as
other
folks
have
in
their
time
taken
to
drink
she
was
young
and
she
could
still
lose
herself
in
a
book
one
day
she
lost
herself
most
completely
in
a
new
novel
from
mudie
a
book
that
every
one
was
talking
about
she
lost
herself
and
suddenly
in
a
breathless
joy
that
was
agony
too
she
found
this
was
his
book
no
one
but
rupert
could
have
written
it
all
that
description
of
the
park
and
the
race
when
she
rode
the
goat
and
he
rode
the
pig
and
she
turned
the
pages
hastily
ah
yes
rupert
had
written
this
she
put
the
book
down
and
she
dressed
herself
as
prettily
as
she
knew
how
and
she
went
in
a
hansom
cab
to
the
office
of
the
publisher
of
that
book
and
on
the
way
she
read
and
more
and
more
she
saw
how
great
a
book
it
was
and
how
no
one
but
rupert
could
have
written
just
that
book
thrill
after
thrill
of
pride
ran
through
her
he
had
done
this
because
of
what
she
had
said
arrived
at
the
publisher
she
was
met
by
a
blank
wall
neither
partner
was
visible
the
senior
clerk
did
not
know
the
address
of
the
author
of
work
while
it
is
yet
day
nor
the
name
of
him
and
it
was
abundantly
evident
that
even
if
he
had
known
he
would
not
have
told
sybil
prettiness
and
her
charm
so
wrought
upon
this
person
however
that
he
volunteered
the
address
of
the
literary
agent
through
whom
the
book
had
been
purchased
and
sybil
found
him
on
a
first
floor
in
one
of
those
imposing
new
buildings
in
arundel
street
he
was
very
nice
and
kind
but
he
could
not
give
his
client
name
without
his
client
permission
the
disappointment
was
bitter
but
i
send
a
letter
for
you
he
tried
to
soften
it
with
sybil
almost
gave
way
a
tear
glistened
on
her
veil
i
do
want
to
see
him
most
awfully
she
said
and
i
know
he
wants
to
see
me
it
was
i
who
rode
the
goat
in
the
book
you
know
she
did
not
realise
how
much
she
was
admitting
but
the
literary
agent
did
look
here
he
said
smartly
i
wire
to
him
at
once
and
if
he
says
i
may
i
give
you
the
address
can
you
call
in
an
hour
sybil
wandered
on
the
embankment
for
a
conscientious
hour
and
then
went
back
the
literary
agent
smiled
victory
the
answer
is
he
said
and
handed
her
a
slip
of
paper
three
chimneys
near
paddock
wood
kent
have
you
a
asked
she
the
dusty
hired
fly
lumbered
and
jolted
along
the
white
roads
and
in
it
as
in
the
train
sybil
read
the
novel
the
book
every
one
was
talking
about
the
great
book
and
her
heart
was
full
to
overflowing
of
joy
and
pride
and
other
things
the
carriage
shook
itself
fiercely
and
stopped
and
she
looked
up
from
the
last
page
of
the
book
with
eyes
that
swam
a
little
to
find
herself
at
the
broken
wooden
gate
of
a
low
white
house
shabbily
blindless
and
a
long
way
off
its
last
painting
and
whitewashing
she
paid
for
the
carriage
and
dismissed
it
she
would
walk
back
to
the
station
with
she
passed
in
at
the
rickety
gate
and
up
the
flagged
path
and
a
bell
in
answer
to
her
touch
jangled
loudly
as
bells
do
in
empty
houses
her
dress
was
greeny
with
lace
about
it
of
the
same
colour
as
very
nice
biscuits
and
her
hat
seemed
to
be
made
entirely
of
yellow
roses
she
was
not
unconscious
of
these
facts
steps
sounded
within
and
they
like
the
bell
seemed
to
sound
in
an
empty
house
the
door
opened
and
there
was
rupert
sybil
lips
were
in
a
smile
that
should
match
the
glow
of
gladness
that
must
shine
on
his
face
when
he
saw
her
her
the
unattainable
the
unapproachable
at
his
very
door
but
her
smile
died
away
for
his
face
was
grave
only
in
his
eyes
something
that
was
bright
and
fierce
and
like
a
flame
leapt
up
and
shone
a
moment
you
he
said
and
sybil
answered
as
most
people
do
to
such
questions
yes
me
there
was
a
pause
her
eyes
wandered
from
his
to
the
blank
face
of
the
house
the
tangle
of
the
untidy
garden
may
i
come
in
she
asked
yes
oh
yes
come
in
she
crossed
the
threshold
the
doorstep
was
dank
with
green
mould
and
followed
him
into
a
room
it
was
a
large
room
and
perfectly
bare
no
carpet
no
curtains
no
pictures
loose
bricks
were
arranged
as
a
fender
and
dead
embers
strewed
the
hearth
there
was
a
table
there
was
a
chair
there
were
scattered
papers
pens
and
ink
from
the
window
one
saw
the
neglected
garden
and
beyond
it
the
round
shoulders
of
the
hills
he
drew
forward
the
one
chair
and
she
sat
down
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fireless
grate
you
are
very
very
pretty
he
said
suddenly
and
the
explanation
of
his
disappearance
suddenly
struck
her
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
but
she
was
not
afraid
when
all
a
woman
thoughts
day
and
night
for
a
year
have
been
given
to
one
man
she
is
not
afraid
of
him
no
not
even
if
he
be
what
sybil
for
one
moment
feared
that
this
man
was
he
read
the
fear
in
her
eyes
no
i
not
mad
he
said
sybil
i
very
glad
you
came
come
to
think
of
it
i
very
glad
to
see
you
it
is
better
than
writing
i
was
just
going
to
write
out
everything
as
well
as
i
could
i
expect
i
should
have
sent
it
to
you
you
know
i
used
to
care
for
you
more
than
i
did
for
any
one
sybil
hands
gripped
the
arms
of
the
windsor
chair
was
he
really
was
it
through
her
that
he
was
come
out
she
said
i
hate
this
place
it
stifles
me
and
lived
here
worked
here
i
lived
here
for
eleven
months
and
three
days
he
said
yes
come
out
so
they
went
out
through
the
burning
july
sun
and
sybil
found
a
sheltered
spot
between
a
larch
and
a
laburnum
now
she
said
throwing
off
her
hat
and
curling
her
green
soft
draperies
among
the
long
grass
come
and
sit
down
and
tell
me
he
threw
himself
on
the
grass
sure
it
wo
bore
you
he
asked
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
he
let
her
take
it
but
his
hand
did
not
hold
hers
i
seem
to
remember
he
said
the
last
time
i
saw
you
you
were
going
away
or
something
you
told
me
i
ought
to
do
something
great
and
i
told
you
or
anyway
i
thought
to
myself
that
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
that
i
always
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
i
do
something
great
whenever
i
chose
to
try
well
yes
you
did
go
away
of
course
i
remember
perfectly
and
i
missed
you
extremely
and
some
one
told
me
i
looked
ill
and
i
went
to
my
doctor
and
he
sent
me
to
a
big
swell
and
said
i
only
got
about
a
year
to
live
so
then
i
began
to
think
her
fingers
tightened
on
the
unresponsive
hand
and
i
thought
here
i
been
thirty
years
in
this
world
i
the
experience
of
and
a
half
i
suppose
the
first
little
bit
does
count
if
i
had
time
i
meant
to
write
another
book
just
to
show
exactly
what
a
man
feels
when
he
knows
he
only
got
a
year
to
live
and
nothing
done
nothing
done
i
wo
believe
it
she
said
you
do
ill
you
as
lean
as
a
greyhound
but
it
may
come
any
day
now
he
went
on
quietly
but
i
done
something
the
book
it
great
they
all
say
so
and
i
know
it
too
but
at
first
just
think
of
gasping
out
your
breath
and
feeling
that
all
the
things
you
had
seen
and
known
and
felt
were
wasted
lost
going
out
with
you
and
that
you
were
going
out
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
taking
everything
you
might
have
done
with
you
the
book
great
she
said
you
done
something
yes
but
for
those
two
days
i
stayed
in
my
rooms
in
st
james
street
and
i
thought
and
thought
and
thought
and
there
was
no
one
to
care
where
i
went
or
what
i
did
except
a
girl
who
was
fond
of
me
when
she
was
little
and
she
had
gone
away
and
was
fond
of
me
any
more
oh
sybil
i
feel
like
a
lunatic
i
mean
you
of
course
but
you
never
cared
and
i
went
to
a
house
agent
and
got
the
house
unfurnished
and
i
bought
the
furniture
there
nothing
much
except
what
you
seen
and
a
bed
and
a
bath
and
some
pots
and
kettles
and
i
lived
alone
in
that
house
and
i
written
that
book
with
death
sitting
beside
me
jogging
my
elbow
every
time
i
stopped
writing
and
saying
up
i
waiting
here
for
you
and
i
shall
have
to
take
you
away
and
have
done
nothing
nothing
nothing
but
you
done
the
book
said
sybil
again
the
larch
and
the
garden
beyond
were
misty
to
her
eyes
she
set
her
teeth
he
must
be
comforted
her
own
agony
that
could
be
dealt
with
later
i
ridden
myself
with
the
curb
he
said
i
thought
it
all
out
proper
food
proper
sleep
proper
exercise
i
would
play
the
fool
with
the
last
chance
and
i
pulled
it
off
i
wrote
the
book
in
four
months
and
every
night
when
i
went
to
sleep
i
wondered
whether
i
should
ever
wake
to
go
on
with
the
book
but
i
did
wake
and
then
i
used
to
leap
up
and
thank
god
and
set
to
work
and
i
done
it
the
book
will
live
every
one
says
it
will
i
sha
have
lived
for
nothing
rupert
she
said
dear
rupert
thank
you
he
said
forlornly
you
very
kind
and
he
drew
his
limp
hand
from
hers
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
grass
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
oh
rupert
why
did
you
write
and
tell
me
what
was
the
use
of
making
you
sad
you
were
always
sorry
for
maimed
things
even
the
worms
the
gardener
cut
in
two
with
his
spade
she
was
struggling
with
a
growing
desire
to
scream
and
shriek
and
to
burst
out
crying
and
tear
the
grass
with
her
hands
he
no
longer
loved
her
that
was
the
lesser
evil
she
could
have
borne
that
have
borne
anything
but
he
was
going
to
die
the
intensity
of
her
belief
that
he
was
going
to
die
caught
her
by
the
throat
she
defended
herself
instinctively
i
do
believe
it
she
said
do
believe
what
that
you
going
to
die
he
laughed
and
when
the
echo
of
that
laugh
had
died
away
in
the
quiet
garden
she
found
that
she
could
no
longer
even
say
that
she
did
not
believe
then
he
said
i
am
going
to
die
and
all
the
values
of
things
have
changed
places
but
i
have
done
something
i
have
buried
my
talent
in
a
napkin
oh
my
pretty
go
away
go
away
you
make
a
fool
of
me
again
i
had
almost
forgotten
how
to
be
sorry
that
you
could
love
me
go
away
go
away
go
go
he
threw
out
his
hands
and
they
lay
along
the
grass
his
face
went
down
into
the
tangled
green
and
she
saw
his
shoulders
shaken
with
sobs
she
dragged
herself
along
the
grass
till
she
was
close
to
him
then
she
lifted
his
shoulders
and
drew
his
head
on
to
her
lap
and
clasped
her
arms
round
him
my
darling
my
dear
my
own
she
said
you
tired
and
thought
of
nothing
but
your
hateful
book
your
beautiful
book
i
mean
but
you
do
love
me
really
not
as
i
love
you
but
still
you
do
love
me
oh
rupert
i
nurse
you
i
take

against
her
waist

she
said

doctor

he

the
best
it
was
strongitharm
he
said
wearily
she
drew
a
long
breath
and
clasped
him
closer
then
she
pushed
him
away
and
sprang
to
her
feet
stand
up
she
said
let
me
look
at
you
he
stood
up
and
she
caught
him
by
the
elbows
and
stood
looking
at
him
twice
she
tried
to
speak
and
twice
no
voice
obeyed
then
she
said
softly
huskily
rupert

a
horrid

the
papers
strongitharm

mad
several
months
ago

he
told
his
patients
they
were
going
to
die
of
this
new
disease
of
his
that
he
invented
it
all
his
madness
well

know
it
oh
rupert

going
to
die
and
we

each
other
oh
god

good
he
drew
a
long
breath
are
you
sure

like
coming
back
from
chloroform
and
yet
it
hurts
and
yet
but
i
wrote
the
book
oh
sybil

great
book
ah

shall
she
said
looking
at

with
wet
eyes
i
have
you
he
said
oh
thank
god
i
have
you
but
i
shall
never
write
another
great
book
and
he
never
has
but
he
is
very
happy
and
sybil
can
not
see
that
his
later
works
are
not
in
the
same
field
with
the
first
she
thinks
the
critics
fools
and
he
loves
her
the
more
for
her
folly
xiii
alcibiades
oh
let
me
have
him
in
the
carriage
with
me
he
wo
hurt
any
one

a
perfect
angel
angels
like
him
travels
in
the
said
the
porter
judy
ended
an
agonised
search
for
her
pocket
would
you
be
offended
she
said
if
i
offered
you
give
the
guard
a
bob
miss
the
hand
curved
into
a
cup
resting
on
the
carriage
window
answered
her
question
it
enough
for
him
being
a
single
man
whereas
me
i
risking
my
situation
and
nine
children
at
present
to
say
no
more
when
i
the
turn
of
a
railway
key
completed
the
sentence
judy
and
the
angel
were
alone
he
was
a
very
nice
angel
and
his
race
the
aberdeen
his
name
alcibiades
he
put
up
a
respectful
and
adoring
nose
and
his
mistress
kissed
him
between
the
eyes
how
could
they
try
to
part
us
she
asked
when
there
only
us
two
left
alcibiades
with
swimming
eyes
echoed
in
a
little
moan
of
true
love
the
question
how
could
they
the
question
was
put
again
by
both
later
in
the
day
judy
was
to
stay
with
an
aunt
while
her
mother
sailed
to
madeira
to
meet
there
the
father
returning
from
south
africa
full
of
wounds
and
honour
and
to
spend
on
the
island
what
was
left
of
the
winter
now
it
was
december
a
thick
fog
covered
london
with
a
veil
of
ugliness
the
cabman
was
aggrieved
and
aggrieving
alcibiades
had
tried
to
bite
him
and
judy
was
on
the
verge
of
tears
when
the
fog
at
last
lifted
and
allowed
her
to
be
driven
to
her
aunt
suburban
house
yellow
brickish
with
a
slate
roof
and
a
lean
forecourt
wherein
cypresses
stunted
and
blackened
spoke
eloquently
of
lives
more
blank
than
the
death
whose
emblem
they
were
through
the
slits
of
the
drab
venetian
blinds
gaslight
streamed
into
the
winter
dusk
there
be
tea
anyhow
sighed
judy
recklessly
overpaying
the
cabman
inside
the
house
where
the
lights
were
the
aunt
was
surrounded
by
a
dozen
ladies
of
about
her
own
age
and
station
tabbies
the
world
might
have
called
them
all
were
busy
with
mysteries
of
many
coloured
silks
and
satins
lace
and
linen
at
least
all
held
such
in
their
hands
the
gathering
was
in
fact
a
working
party
for
the
approaching
bazaar
but
the
real
work
of
bazaars
is
not
done
at
parties
yes
the
aunt
was
saying
so
nice
for
dear
julia
i
truly
glad
that
she
should
begin
her
visit
with
a
little
gaiety
in
parting
or
sorrow
we
should
always
seek
to
distract
the
mind
should
we
not
dear
mrs
biddle
the
young
are
all
too
easily
distracted
by
the
shows
of
this
world
said
dear
mrs
biddle
heavily
and
several
ladies
murmured
approval
but
you
ca
exactly
call
a
church
bazaar
the
shows
of
this
world
can
you
urged
the
aunt
sitting
very
upright
all
black
and
beady
it
the
thin
end
of
the
rubicon
sometimes
said
mrs
biddle
then
why
began
the
youngest
tabby
and
then
the
door
bell
rang
and
every
one
said
here
she
is
the
prim
maid
announced
her
and
she
took
two
steps
forward
and
stood
blinking
in
the
gaslight
with
her
hat
on
one
side
and
no
gloves
every
one
noticed
that
at
once
come
in
my
dear
said
the
aunt
rustling
forward
i
have
a
few
friends
this
afternoon
and
oh
my
gracious
what
has
happened
what
had
happened
was
quite
simple
in
her
rustling
advance
some
wandering
trail
of
the
aunt
black
beadiness
had
caught
on
the
knotted
fringe
of
the
and
drawn
this
after
her
a
mass
of
silk
and
lace
and
ribbon
lay
sprinkled
along
the
edges
of
the
table
where
the
tabbies
sat
a
good
store
of
needles
scissors
and
cotton
reels
mingled
with
it
now
all
this
swept
to
the
floor
on
the
moving
at
the
very
instant
when
a
rough
person
with
a
sharp
nose
and
very
muddy
paws
bounded
into
the
room
to
the
full
length
of
his
chain
his
bound
landed
him
in
the
very
middle
of
the
confusion
judy
caught
the
dog
up
in
her
arms
and
her
apologies
would
have
melted
my
heart
or
yours
dear
reader
in
an
instant
but
tabbies
are
tabbies
and
a
bazaar
is
a
bazaar
no
more
sewing
was
done
that
day
what
was
left
of
the
afternoon
proved
all
too
short
for
the
disentangling
the
partial
cleansing
of
the
desecrated
and
alcibiades
was
tied
up
in
the
to
the
wheel
of
the
patent
mangle
he
howled
without
ceasing
my
dear
said
the
aunt
when
tea
was
over
and
the
last
tabby
had
found
her
goloshes
and
gone
home
in
them
you
are
most
welcome
under
any
roof
of
mine
but
may
i
ask
you
to
close
the
baize
door
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
stairs
thank
you
and
now
this
one
i
am
obliged
one
can
not
hear
oneself
speak
for
that
terrible
animal
you
must
get
rid
of
the
cur
oh
aunt
he
not
a
cur
he
thank
you
said
the
aunt
i
believe
i
am
as
good
a
judge
of
dogs
as
any
lady
my
own
dear
snubs
has
only
been
dead
a
year
and
two
months
last
tuesday
i
know
that
a
dog
should
have
smooth
hair
at
any
rate
the
mother
of
snubs
had
been
distantly
related
to
a
family
of
respectable
i
am
very
sorry
said
judy
she
meant
apology
but
the
aunt
took
it
for
sympathy
and
softened
somewhat
a
nice
little
dog
now
she
said
a
or
an
italian
greyhound
you
see
i
am
not
ignorant
of
the
names
of
various
patterns
of
dog
i
will
get
you
one
myself
we
will
go
to
the
dogs
home
at
battersea
where
really
nice
dogs
are
often
sold
quite
cheap
or
perhaps
they
might
take
your
poor
cur
in
exchange
judy
began
to
cry
yes
cry
my
dear
said
the
aunt
kindly
it
will
do
you
a
world
of
good
when
the
aunt
was
asleep
she
had
closed
her
ears
to
the
protests
of
alcibiades
with
wadding
left
over
from
a
handkerchief
sachet
judy
crept
down
in
her
woolly
white
and
coaxed
the
kitchen
fire
back
to
life
then
she
sat
in
front
of
it
on
the
speckless
rag
carpet
and
nursed
alcibiades
and
scolded
him
and
explained
that
he
really
must
be
a
good
dog
and
that
we
all
have
something
to
put
up
with
in
this
life
you
know
alby
dear
she
said
it
not
very
nice
for
me
either
but
do
howl
and
try
to
upset
mangles
do
you
be
afraid
dear
you
sha
go
to
the
dogs
home
so
kindly
yet
strongly
did
she
urge
her
point
that
alcibiades
tied
to
the
leg
of
the
kitchen
table
consented
to
sleep
quietly
for
the
rest
of
the
night
next
day
when
the
aunt
enquired
searchingly
as
to
judy
powers
of
fancywork
and
what
she
would
do
for
the
bazaar
judy
declared
outright
that
she
did
not
know
one
end
of
a
needle
from
the
other
but
i
can
paint
a
little
she
said
and
i
am
rather
good
at
that
will
be
very
nice
the
aunt
already
saw
in
fancy
her
stall
outshine
those
of
all
other
tabbies
with
glories
of
sabots
and
tambourines
decorated
with
rosy
sprays
and
carved
white
wood
boxes
just
the
size
to
hold
nothing
useful
and
i
do
you
some
said
judy
only
i
ca
work
if
i
distracted
about
alby
my
dog
you
know
oh
aunt
let
him
stay
he
really
is
valuable
and
he
has
made
a
bit
of
noise
since
last
night
it
is
quite
useless
the
aunt
was
sternly
beginning
then
suddenly
her
voice
changed
is
the
cur
valuable
she
asked
uncle
reggie
gave
five
guineas
for
him
when
he
was
a
baby
boy
said
judy
eagerly
and
he
worth
much
more
now
but
he
must
be
very
old
when
your
uncle
reggie
was
a
boy
i
mean
when
alcibiades
was
a
boy
and
who
is
alcibiades
judy
began
all
over
again
and
urged
one
or
two
new
points
i
do
want
to
be
harsh
said
the
aunt
at
last
you
have
the
little
breakfast
room
to
paint
and
carve
in
as
you
suggest
of
course
i
could
have
shavings
and
paint
pots
lying
about
all
over
the
and
and
you
shall
keep
your
cur
oh
aunty
cried
judy
you
are
a
darling
yes
the
aunt
went
on
complacently
you
shall
keep
your
cur
till
the
bazaar
and
then
we
will
sell
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
fund
for
the
amelioration
of
the
daughters
of
the
country
clergy
and
from
this
decision
no
tears
and
no
entreaties
would
move
her
judy
made
a
den
for
herself
and
alcibiades
in
the
little
breakfast
room
there
was
no
painting
light
so
she
looked
out
a
handful
of
the
sketches
that
she
had
done
last
summer
and
framed
them
most
of
her
time
she
spent
in
writing
to
her
friends
to
know
whether
any
one
could
take
care
of
a
darling
dog
who
was
a
perfect
angel
and
alas
no
one
could
or
would
with
the
connivance
of
the
cook
alcibiades
had
a
bed
in
a
box
in
the
den
and
from
the
very
first
he
would
at
a
word
conceal
himself
in
it
the
moment
the
step
of
the
aunt
sounded
on
the
stairs
the
sketches
were
framed
and
some
of
the
frames
were
lightly
carved
the
aunt
was
enchanted
but
on
the
subject
of
alcibiades
adamant
and
now
it
was
the
day
of
the
bazaar
judy
had
run
wires
along
the
wall
of
the
schoolroom
behind
her
aunt
stall
and
from
it
hung
the
best
of
the
sketches
she
had
arranged
the
stall
herself
glorifying
it
with
the
eastern
shawls
and
draperies
that
her
father
had
sent
her
from
india
it
did
far
outshine
any
other
stall
even
that
of
lady
bates
the
wife
of
the
tallow
knight
the
aunt
was
really
grateful
truly
appreciative
but
her
mind
was
made
up
about
the
cur
if
it
really
worth
anything
we
sell
it
if
not
she
paused
on
the
dark
hint
and
judy
miserable
fancy
lost
itself
among
ropes
and
rivers
and
to
alcibiades
the
bazaar
was
as
much
a
festival
as
to
any
tabby
of
them
all
he
had
been
washed
which
is
terrible
at
the
time
but
makes
you
afterwards
a
little
even
he
had
been
allowed
to
come
out
by
the
front
door
with
his
mistress
in
her
beautiful
dress
that
reminded
him
of
rabbits
no
one
but
alcibiades
himself
will
ever
know
what
tortures
of
shame
and
misery
fighting
with
joy
and
affection
he
had
endured
on
those
other
occasions
when
he
had
been
smuggled
out
of
the
back
door
in
the
early
morning
to
take
the
damp
air
with
his
beloved
lady
and
she
had
worn
a
shabby
mackintosh
and
a
red
he
wore
a
blue
ribbon
it
was
uncomfortable
but
he
knew
it
spelt
distinction
he
rode
in
a
carriage
it
was
not
like
the
little
which
had
carried
him
and
his
mistress
through
the
lanes
about
maidstone
but
it
was
a
carriage
and
a
large
horse
was
his
slave
his
mistress
herself
had
tied
his
blue
ribbon
it
was
she
too
who
adjusted
the
chain
that
attached
him
to
a
strong
staple
driven
in
just
above
the
schoolroom
wainscotting
the
chain
allowed
him
to
sit
at
her
feet
as
she
stood
by
the
stall
waiting
for
purchasers
and
scanning
the
face
of
each
newcomer
in
an
eager
anxiety
to
find
there
the
countenance
of
some
one
who
really
loved
dogs
but
the
people
were
most
awful
and
she
had
to
own
it
to
herself
there
were
tabbies
by
the
dozen
and
young
ladies
by
the
score
young
ladies
all
dressed
differently
yet
all
alike
in
the
fashion
of
the
year
before
last
all
smiling
agreeably
because
they
knew
they
ought
to
smile
the
young
of
the
tabby
kind
tabby
kittens
in
fact
no
doubt
they
were
really
worthy
and
interesting
but
they
did
not
seem
so
to
judy
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
men
mostly
and
bald
there
were
a
few
youths
by
some
fatality
all
were
fair
and
reminded
judy
of
pork
a
tabby
stopped
at
her
stall
turned
over
all
things
and
bought
a
beaded
ring
the
purchase
and
the
purchaser
seemed
to
judy
to
typify
her
whole
life
and
surroundings
all
her
soul
reached
out
to
the
island
she
sighed
then
she
looked
up
the
crowd
had
thickened
since
she
last
surveyed
it
four
steps
led
down
to
the
schoolroom
from
the
outer
world
on
the
top
step
was
a
lady
well
dressed
oh
marvel
and
beside
her
a
man
a
gentleman
well
judy
supposed
all
these
poor
dear
people
were
gentlefolk
but
these
two
were
of
her
world
as
she
gazed
her
eyes
and
those
of
the
man
met
the
lady
was
lost
in
the
crowd
and
judy
saw
her
no
more
the
man
made
straight
for
the
stall
where
were
the
framed
sketches
the
white
dress
the
russet
hair
and
green
eyes
of
judy
and
the
alcibiades
but
before
he
reached
them
a
wave
of
buyers
broke
on
the
shore
of
stall
and
he
had
been
watching
her
for
nearly
half
an
hour
before
a
young
woman
choice
of
a
christmas
gift
for
a
grandfather
fell
happily
on
a
pair
of
purple
and
for
the
moment
judy
breathed
free
i
told
you
so
said
the
aunt
rattling
money
in
a
leather
bag
i
just
before
christmas
was
time
everybody
to
give
christmas
presents
to
all
their
relations
you
see
the
things
are
going
like
wildfire
yes
aunt
said
judy
alcibiades
took
advantage
of
the
momentary
calm
to
lick
her
hand
exhaustively
judy
wondered
wearily
what
had
become
of
the
man
the
only
man
in
that
cheerless
assembly
who
looked
as
though
he
liked
dogs
he
must
have
been
trying
to
get
somewhere
else
she
said
he
just
looked
in
here
by
mistake
and
when
he
saw
the
sort
of
people
we
were
he
well
i
do
wonder
she
sighed
and
raising
her
eyes
met
his
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
he
meant
apology
she
took
it
for
enquiry
and
smiled
do
you
want
to
buy
something
she
asked
her
smile
was
more
tired
than
she
knew
i
suppose
i
do
he
said
one
does
at
bazaars
do
you
know
do
you
want
a
christmas
present
asked
judy
businesslike
if
so
and
if
you
will
tell
me
what
kind
of
relation
you
want
it
for
perhaps
i
can
find
something
that
they
like
could
you
now
that
is
really
good
i
want
things
for
two
aunts
three
cousins
a
little
sister
and
my
mother
but
i
need
get
here
unless
you
got
something
you
think
really
by
jove
his
eyes
had
caught
the
sketches
are
for
sale
that
is
rather
the
idea
said
judy
her
spirits
were
rising
though
she
could
have
told
you
why
things
at
a
bazaar
are
usually
for
sale
are
they
everything
said
he
and
he
stroked
the
not
resentful
neck
of
alcibiades
this
good
little
beast
is
in
the
market
i
afraid
why
would
you
buy
him
i
think
twice
before
i
said
no
my
mother
is
frightfully
fond
of
dogs
quite
unreasonably
judy
felt
that
she
did
not
want
to
sell
alcibiades
as
a
present
to
any
one
mother
the
sketches
she
said
the
sketches
said
he
why
there
maidstone
church
and
farley
and
teston
lock
and
allington
how
much
are
they
she
told
him
i
must
have
some
may
i
have
a
dozen
they
disgracefully
cheap
and
i
feel
like
an
american
pork
man
buying
works
of
art
by
the
dozen
for
they
jolly
good
and
it
brings
back
old
times
i
was
quartered
there
once
i
knew
it
she
said
to
herself
alcibiades
stood
up
with
his
paws
on
her
arm
be
quiet
she
said
to
him
you
must
talk
now
i
busy
alcibiades
gave
her
a
reproachful
look
and
lay
down
the
stranger
smiled
a
very
jolly
smile
judy
thought
ripping
little
beast
is
he
said
the
stranger
i
suppose
you
invalided
home
she
said
she
could
help
it
a
man
in
the
service
one
who
had
been
quartered
at
maidstone
her
own
dear
maidstone
he
was
no
longer
a
stranger
yes
he
said
beastly
bore
but
i
shall
be
all
right
in
two
or
three
months
i
hope
the
fighting
wo
be
all
over
by
then
have
you
sold
this
gentleman
anything
said
the
aunt
firmly
because
mrs
biddle
wants
to
look
at
some
i
just
selling
something
answered
judy
then
she
turned
to
him
and
spoke
softly
i
say
do
you
really
like
dogs
said
she
of
course
i
do
the
young
man
opened
surprised
grey
eyes
at
her
as
who
should
say
now
do
i
look
like
a
man
who
does
like
dogs
well
then
she
said
alcibiades
for
sale
is
that
his
name
why
oh
surely
you
know
was
it
alcibiades
who
gave
up
being
dictator
or
something
rather
than
have
his
dog
ears
cut
off
i
seem
to
remember
something
of
the
sort
he
said
well
said
she
his
price
is
twenty
guineas
but
he
whistled
very
softly
yes
i
know
she
said
but
i
yes
aunt
in
one
moment
she
went
on
in
an
agonised
undertone
his
price
is
twenty
guineas
say
have
him
say
it
you
wo
really
have
to
pay
anything
for
him
no
i
not
mad
i
give
you
twenty
guineas
for
the
dog
said
the
man
standing
straight
and
soldierly
against
the
tumbled
mass
of
mats
and
and
the
aunt
drew
a
long
breath
and
turned
to
minister
to
mrs
biddle
deep
need
of
come
and
have
tea
said
the
stranger
you
tired
out
no
i
ca
of
course
i
ca
but
i
take
you
over
to
mrs
stall
and
she
led
him
away
look
here
she
said
i
sure
a
decent
sort
here
the
money
to
pay
for
him
my
aunt
says
if
i
sell
him
she
have
him
killed
will
you
keep
him
for
me
till
my
people
come
home
oh
do
he
really
an
angel
and
give
me
your
name
and
address
you
must
think
me
a
maniac
but
i
am
so
horribly
fond
of
him
will
you
of
course
i
will
he
said
heartily
but
i
shall
pay
for
him
write
a
cheque
you
can
pay
me
when
you
get
him
back
thank
you
yes
i
am
sure
that
would
delight
my
aunt
judy
with
burning
cheeks
found
her
way
back
to
her
stall
oh
alcibiades
she
said
unfastening
the
blue
ribbon
i
sure
nice
do
bite
him
there
a
dear
a
cheque
signed
richard
graeme
and
a
card
with
an
address
came
into
judy
hands
and
the
chain
of
alcibiades
left
them
i
know
you
be
good
to
him
she
said
do
give
him
meat
only
biscuit
and
sulphur
in
his
drinking
water
but
you
know
all
that
you
got
me
out
of
a
frightful
hole
and
i
bless
you
as
long
as
i
live
she
stooped
to
the
aberdeen
now
surprised
and
pained
my
dear
old
boy
and
alcibiades
stubborn
resistance
in
every
line
of
his
figure
in
every
hair
of
his
coat
was
dragged
away
through
the
crowded
bazaar
judy
went
to
bed
very
tired
the
bazaar
had
been
a
success
and
the
success
had
been
talked
over
and
the
money
counted
till
late
in
the
evening
nearly
eleven
that
is
which
is
late
for
tabbies
yet
she
woke
at
four
some
one
was
calling
her
it
was
no
he
was
gone
her
eyes
pricked
at
the
thought
yet
surely
that
could
be
the
voice
of
no
other
than
alcibiades
she
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
it
was
he
that
was
his
dear
voice
whining
at
the
side
gate
those
were
his
darling
paws
scratching
the
sacred
paint
off
it
judy
swept
down
the
stairs
like
a
silent
whirlwind
turned
key
drew
bolts
and
in
a
moment
she
and
the
cur
were
sobbing
in
each
arms
she
carried
him
up
to
her
room
washed
his
dear
muddy
paws
and
spread
her
golf
cape
that
he
might
lie
on
the
bed
beside
her
in
chilliest
earliest
dawn
she
rose
and
dressed
she
found
a
wire
that
had
supported
her
pictures
at
the
bazaar
and
she
wrote
a
note
and
tied
it
to
the
collar
of
alcibiades
where
she
noticed
and
untied
a
frayed
end
of
rope
this
was
the
note
he
has
run
home
to
me
why
did
you
take
the
chain
off
he
always
bites
through
cord
do
beat
him
for
it
he
soon
forget
me
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
as
she
wrote
it
it
seemed
to
her
so
very
pathetic
she
did
not
quite
believe
that
alcibiades
would
soon
forget
her
but
if
he
did
the
note
did
not
lack
pathos
either
in
the
eyes
of
captain
graeme
when
two
hours
later
he
found
it
under
the
chin
of
a
mournfully
howling
alcibiades
securely
attached
by
picture
wire
to
the
railings
of
his
mother
house
the
captain
took
a
turn
on
the
heath
and
thought
and
his
thoughts
were
these
she
the
prettiest
girl
i
seen
since
i
came
home
deuced
dull
here
should
wonder
if
she
dull
too
poor
little
girl
then
he
went
home
and
cut
a
glove
in
pieces
and
sewed
the
pieces
together
slowly
but
solidly
as
soldiers
and
sailors
do
sew
so
that
when
two
nights
later
the
claws
and
the
voice
of
alcibiades
roused
judy
from
sleep
her
aunt
most
fortunately
slept
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
she
found
after
the
first
rapturous
hug
of
reunion
a
something
under
the
hand
that
caressed
the
neck
of
alcibiades
the
gaslight
in
her
own
room
defined
the
something
as
a
bag
of
leather
the
tan
leather
of
which
gentlemen
gloves
are
made
there
was
a
bit
of
worn
strap
hanging
below
it
within
was
a
note
a
thousand
thanks
for
bringing
him
home
if
he
run
away
again
please
let
me
know
and
do
trouble
to
send
him
back
i
call
for
him
if
i
may
richard
graeme
judy
would
very
much
have
liked
to
let
captain
graeme
call
but
there
are
such
things
as
aunts
she
tied
another
note
to
the
cur
collar
and
wired
him
once
more
to
the
paragon
house
railings
the
note
said
it
no
use
he
can
bite
through
leather
do
use
a
chain
next
time
alcibiades
returned
he
dragged
a
half
yard
of
fine
chain
it
was
neatly
filed
but
judy
was
a
woman
and
the
detail
escaped
her
that
morning
she
and
alcibiades
slept
late
the
was
ringing
as
she
woke
the
cook
helped
the
aunt
most
fortunately
had
a
luncheon
engagement
with
a
tabby
in
sidcup
alcibiades
being
promised
a
walk
later
consented
to
wait
trifling
with
a
bone
in
silence
and
the
coal
cellar
at
eleven
judy
rewarded
his
patience
she
went
out
with
him
and
somehow
it
seemed
wise
to
put
on
a
dress
and
one
best
furs
and
one
prettiest
hat
i
am
afraid
i
shall
see
him
she
told
herself
but
she
added
i
am
much
more
afraid
that
my
aunt
will
see
alcibiades
on
the
edge
of
the
heath
she
met
him
here
the
dear
dog
she
said
oh
ca
you
find
a
stronger
chain
i
try
said
he
what
a
ripping
day
is
it
oh
are
you
going
straight
back
i
wish
we
met
anywhere
but
at
a
bazaar
so
do
i
she
said
heartfeltly
and
caressed
the
now
careless
aberdeen
it
was
at
a
bazaar
that
she
had
had
to
sell
that
angel
may
i
walk
home
with
you
he
said
and
she
could
not
think
of
any
polite
way
of
saying
no
though
she
knew
just
how
terrible
alcibiades
would
make
the
final
parting
next
morning
the
chain
dragged
by
alcibiades
was
slightly
thicker
it
also
was
filed
and
this
too
judy
failed
to
notice
early
as
it
was
she
did
not
go
out
in
the
mackintosh
but
in
something
simple
and
blue
with
kingfisher
wings
in
her
hat
the
morning
was
thinly
bright
alcibiades
saw
a
cat
and
chased
it
towards
morden
college
just
as
judy
met
captain
graeme
it
was
for
her
impossible
not
to
follow
the
cur
and
how
could
the
captain
do
otherwise
than
follow
too
and
if
two
people
walk
together
it
is
churlish
not
to
talk
next
day
the
chain
was
thicker
the
hour
propitious
and
the
walk
longer
that
was
the
day
when
she
found
out
that
he
had
known
her
father
in
south
africa
the
days
passed
with
a
delightful
monotony
the
aunt
and
her
pet
tabbies
all
day
a
sound
sleep
an
early
waking
a
heavenly
meeting
with
alcibiades
at
the
back
door
the
restoring
of
him
to
his
master
and
every
day
the
chain
grew
heavier
the
walks
longer
the
talks
more
interesting
and
more
intimate
it
was
very
wrong
of
course
but
what
was
the
girl
to
do
you
can
not
be
rude
to
a
man
who
is
saving
your
dog
your
darling
from
rivers
and
ropes
and
if
dogs
break
chains
why
so
will
girls
it
was
on
christmas
day
that
the
spell
was
shattered
judy
awoke
at
the
accustomed
time
but
no
welcome
whine
no
pathetic
scrabble
of
eager
paws
broke
the
respectable
stillness
of
the
aunt
house
judy
listened
she
even
crept
down
to
the
side
gate
a
feeling
of
misery
of
real
physical
faintness
came
over
her
alcibiades
was
not
there
he
had
not
come
he
had
indeed
forgotten
her
the
conviction
that
the
master
of
alcibiades
would
be
the
last
to
appreciate
the
new
attachment
of
his
dog
comforted
her
a
little
but
for
all
that
the
day
was
grey
life
seemed
worthless
judy
now
had
leisure
to
reconsider
her
position
and
she
was
not
pleased
with
herself
it
was
in
the
thick
of
the
christmas
beef
that
the
thought
awoke
is
tired
of
meeting
me
he
has
locked
alcibiades
up
if
he
had
the
darling
have
come
since
this
solution
left
alcibiades
without
a
stain
upon
his
faithful
character
it
ought
to
have
been
comforting
but
it
was
she
felt
her
cheeks
flush
good
gracious
child
said
the
aunt
what
are
you
turning
that
curious
purple
colour
for
if
the
fire
too
much
for
you
let
mary
put
the
screen
to
the
back
of
your
chair
for
goodness
sake
when
the
remains
had
passed
away
and
the
perfunctory
dessert
was
over
the
aunt
retired
to
rest
judy
was
left
to
face
the
grey
afternoon
alone
she
sat
staring
into
the
fire
till
her
eyes
ached
she
felt
very
lonely
very
injured
very
forlorn
there
was
a
footfall
on
the
steps
a
manly
tread
a
knock
at
the
door
a
kind
of
i
sort
of
knock
judy
jumped
up
to
look
in
the
glass
and
pat
her
hair
for
no
one
but
an
idiot
could
have
helped
knowing
who
it
was
that
stepped
and
knocked
he
came
in
alone
said
he
what
luck
i
asked
for
the
aunt
meant
to
say
friend
of
your
father
and
all
that
but
this
is
better
judy
i
stand
it
she
coming
i
can
hear
her
there
was
indeed
a
sound
of
stout
house
boots
trampling
overhead
of
drawers
being
pulled
out
of
wardrobe
doors
being
opened
i
wish
everything
was
different
said
he
but
oh
judy
darling
do
say
yes
say
it
now
this
minute
and
then
when
she
comes
down
i
can
tell
her
we
engaged
see
it
all
very
well
said
judy
two
hours
later
when
with
the
licence
of
an
engaged
young
lady
she
said
to
her
lover
at
the
front
door
you
say
you
do
and
and
yes
of
course
i
glad
but
alcibiades
does
love
me
any
more
does
he
you
wait
till
i
bring
him
but
he
never
came
this
morning
poor
little
beast
judy
the
fact
is
i
gone
on
making
the
chain
heavier
and
heavier
and
this
morning
well
it
was
too
much
for
him
he
could
drag
it
all
the
way
it
was
a
regular
ship
cable
do
you
know
i
came
up
with
him
at
blackheath
station
and
he
was
so
done
i
had
to
carry
him
all
the
way
home
in
my
arms
he
quite
all
right
again
now
i
left
him
at
home
tied
to
the
in
my
bedroom
then
he
love
me
after
all
said
judy
well
he
not
the
only
one
said
the
captain
and
at
that
moment
came
from
the
other
side
of
the
front
door
the
familiar
whine
the
scratching
mingled
with
strange
clanking
noises
next
instant
three
happy
people
were
embracing
on
the
amid
the
sobs
of
judy
the
laughter
of
her
lover
the
yelps
of
alcibiades
and
the
deafening
rattle
of
a
poker
a
pair
of
tongs
