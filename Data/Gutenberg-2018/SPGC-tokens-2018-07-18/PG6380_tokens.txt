cornelli
by

spyri
foreword
many
writers
have
suffered
injustice
in
being
known
as
the
author
of
but
one
book
robinson
crusoe
was
not
defoe
only
masterpiece
nor
did
bunyan
confine
his
best
powers
to
pilgrim
progress
not
one
person
in
ten
of
those
who
read
lorna
doone
is
aware
that
several
of
blackmore
other
novels
are
almost
equally
charming
such
too
has
been
the
fate
of
johanna
spyri
the
swiss
authoress
whose
reputation
is
mistakenly
supposed
to
rest
on
her
story
of
heidi
to
be
sure
heidi
is
a
book
that
in
its
field
can
hardly
be
overpraised
the
winsome
little
heroine
in
her
mountain
background
is
a
figure
to
be
remembered
from
childhood
to
old
age
nevertheless
madame
spyri
has
shown
here
but
one
side
of
her
narrative
ability
if
as
i
believe
the
present
story
is
here
first
presented
to
readers
of
english
it
must
be
through
a
strange
oversight
for
in
it
we
find
a
deeper
treatment
of
character
combined
with
equal
spirit
and
humor
of
a
different
kind
cornelli
the
heroine
suffers
temporarily
from
the
unjust
suspicion
of
her
elders
a
misfortune
which
it
is
to
be
feared
still
occurs
frequently
in
the
case
of
sensitive
children
how
she
was
restored
to
herself
and
reinstated
in
her
father
affection
forms
a
narrative
of
unusual
interest
and
truth
to
life
whereas
in
heidi
there
is
only
one
other
childish
figure
if
we
except
the
droll
peasant
boy
peter
we
have
here
a
lively
and
varied
array
of
children
manly
generous
dino
mux
the
irrepressible
and
the
two
girls
form
a
truly
lovable
group
the
too
are
contrasted
with
much
humor
and
genuine
feeling
the
story
of
cornelli
therefore
deserves
to
equal
heidi
in
popularity
and
there
can
be
no
question
that
it
will
delight
madame
spyri
admirers
and
will
do
much
to
increase
the
love
which
all
children
feel
for
her
unique
and
sympathetic
genius

beside
the
roaring
spring
had
come
again
on
the
banks
of
the
and
the
young
beech
trees
were
swaying
to
and
fro
one
moment
their
glossy
foliage
was
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
and
the
next
a
deep
shadow
was
cast
over
the
leaves
a
strong
south
wind
was
blowing
driving
huge
clouds
across
the
sun
a
little
girl
with
glowing
cheeks
and
blowing
hair
came
running
through
the
wood
her
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
while
she
was
being
driven
along
by
the
wind
or
had
to
fight
her
way
against
it
from
her
arm
was
dangling
a
hat
which
as
she
raced
along
seemed
anxious
to
free
itself
from
the
fluttering
ribbons
in
order
to
fly
away
the
child
now
slackened
her
pace
and
began
to
sing
the
snow
on
the
meadow
the
snow
all
around
the
snow
lies
in
heaps
all
over
the
ground
hurrah
oh
hurrah
all
over
the
ground
oh
cuckoo
from
the
woods
oh
flowers
so
bright
oh
kindliest
sun
come
and
bring
us
delight
hurrah
oh
hurrah
come
and
bring
us
delight
when
the
swallow
comes
back
and
the
finches
all
sing
i
sing
and
i
dance
for
joy
of
the
spring
hurrah
oh
hurrah
for
joy
of
the
spring
the
woods
rang
with
her
full
young
voice
and
her
song
also
roused
the
birds
for
they
too
now
carolled
loudly
ready
to
outdo
each
other
laughingly
the
child
sang
once
more
with
all
her
might
hurrah
oh
hurrah
for
joy
of
the
spring
and
from
all
the
branches
sounded
a
many
voiced
chorus
right
on
the
edge
of
the
woods
stood
a
splendid
old
beech
tree
with
a
high
firm
trunk
under
which
the
child
had
often
sought
quiet
and
shelter
after
running
about
in
the
sun
she
had
reached
the
tree
now
and
was
looking
up
at
the
branches
which
were
rocking
up
and
down
the
child
however
did
not
rest
very
long
over
where
the
wind
struck
an
open
space
it
blew
as
mightily
as
ever
and
the
roaring
high
up
in
the
seemed
to
urge
her
on
to
new
exertions
first
she
began
fighting
her
way
against
the
wind
but
soon
she
turned
driven
by
it
she
flew
down
the
steep
incline
to
the
path
which
led
down
to
the
narrow
valley
she
kept
on
running
till
she
had
reached
a
small
wooden
house
which
looked
down
from
a
high
bank
to
the
roaring
mountain
stream
a
narrow
stairway
led
up
from
the
ground
to
the
front
door
of
the
little
dwelling
and
to
the
porch
where
on
a
wide
railing
were
some
fragrant
carnations
the
lively
little
girl
now
leaped
up
the
steps
two
at
a
time
soon
she
reached
the
top
and
one
could
see
that
the
house
was
familiar
to
her
martha
martha
come
out
she
called
through
the
open
door
have
you
noticed
yet
how
jolly
the
wind
is
a
small
old
woman
with
gray
hair
now
came
out
to
greet
the
child
she
was
dressed
in
the
simplest
fashion
and
wore
a
cap
on
her
head
her
clothes
were
so
very
tidy
and
clean
however
that
it
seemed
as
if
she
might
have
sat
on
a
chair
all
day
for
fear
of
spoiling
them
yet
her
hands
told
another
tale
for
they
were
roughened
by
hard
work
oh
martha
the
child
said
i
just
wish
you
knew
how
wonderful
the
wind
is
up
there
in
the
woods
and
on
the
hill
one
has
to
fight
it
with
all
one
might
otherwise
one
might
be
blown
down
the
mountain
side
like
a
bird
it
would
be
so
hard
then
to
get
on
one
feet
again
would
it
oh
i
wish
you
knew
what
fun
it
is
to
be
out
in
the
wind
i
think
i
would
rather
not
know
said
martha
shaking
the
hand
it
seems
to
me
that
the
wind
has
pulled
you
about
quite
a
little
come
we
straighten
you
up
again
the
child
thick
dark
hair
was
in
a
terrible
state
what
belonged
on
the
left
side
of
the
parting
had
been
blown
to
the
right
and
what
belonged
on
the
right
side
was
thrown
to
the
left
the
little
apron
instead
of
being
in
front
hung
down
on
the
side
and
from
the
bottom
of
her
skirt
the
braid
hung
loose
carrying
upon
it
brambles
and
forest
leaves
first
martha
combed
the
little
girl
hair
then
she
pulled
the
apron
into
place
finally
she
got
a
thread
and
needle
and
began
to
mend
the
braid
on
the
dress
stop
martha
stop
please
cornelli
called
out
suddenly
pulling
her
skirt
away
you
must
not
sew
for
your
finger
is
all
pricked
to
pieces
there
is
only
half
of
it
left
with
those
horrible
marks
that
does
not
matter
just
give
me
your
little
skirt
replied
martha
continuing
her
sewing
this
kind
of
work
does
not
hurt
me
but
when
i
sew
heavy
shirts
for
the
farmers
and
the
workmen
in
the
iron
works
the
material
is
so
rough
that
as
i
push
the
needle
in
i
often
prick
off
little
pieces
of
my
finger
why
should
you
have
to
do
that
martha
they
could
make
their
own
shirts
and
prick
their
own
fingers
cried
cornelli
indignantly
no
no
cornelli
do
not
speak
like
that
replied
the
woman
you
see
i
am
glad
and
grateful
to
be
able
to
get
work
enough
to
earn
my
living
without
help
i
have
to
be
thankful
to
our
lord
for
all
the
good
things
he
gives
me
and
especially
for
giving
me
enough
strength
for
my
work
cornelli
looked
about
her
searchingly
in
the
little
room
it
was
modestly
furnished
but
most
scrupulously
clean
i
do
not
think
that
god
gave
you
so
very
much
really
but
you
keep
everything
so
neat
and
do
it
all
yourself
remarked
cornelli
i
have
to
thank
our
lord
though
that
i
am
able
to
do
it
returned
martha
you
see
cornelli
if
i
had
not
the
health
to
do
everything
the
way
i
like
it
done
who
could
do
it
for
me
it
is
a
great
gift
to
be
able
to
step
out
every
morning
into
the
sunshine
and
to
my
carnations
then
i
thank
god
in
my
heart
for
the
joy
of
a
new
day
before
me
there
are
many
poor
people
who
wake
up
only
to
sorrow
and
tears
they
have
to
spend
all
day
on
their
sick
beds
and
have
many
troubles
besides
can
you
see
now
cornelli
how
grateful
i
have
to
be
to
our
lord
because
nothing
prevents
me
from
sewing
even
if
i
have
to
prick
my
fingers
but
i
believe
i
hear
the
bell
in
the
foundry
you
know
that
means
supper
time
so
run
back
to
the
house
as
quickly
as
you
can
martha
knew
well
enough
that
she
had
to
remind
her
little
friend
about
returning
for
often
time
had
been
forgotten
and
cornelli
had
had
to
be
sent
for
but
now
the
little
girl
began
to
run
swiftly
down
the
incline
beside
the
rushing
stream
soon
she
came
to
the
large
buildings
from
which
the
sound
of
hissing
fires
loud
thumping
and
hammering
could
be
heard
all
day
the
noise
was
so
great
that
only
the
roaring
of
the
stream
could
drown
it
here
were
the
works
of
the
great
iron
foundry
well
known
far
and
wide
since
most
of
those
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
found
employment
there
glancing
at
the
large
doors
and
seeing
that
they
were
closed
cornelli
flew
by
them
with
great
bounds
in
an
isolated
house
well
raised
above
the
stream
lived
the
proprietor
of
the
foundry
beautiful
flower
gardens
were
on
three
sides
cornelli
approached
the
open
space
in
front
and
was
soon
inside
flinging
her
hat
into
a
corner
she
entered
the
room
where
her
father
was
already
sitting
at
table
he
did
not
even
look
up
for
he
was
holding
a
large
newspaper
in
front
of
him
as
cornelli
soup
was
waiting
for
her
she
ate
it
quickly
and
since
her
father
made
no
movement
behind
his
paper
she
helped
herself
to
everything
else
that
was
before
her
while
she
was
nibbling
on
an
apple
her
father
looked
up
and
said
i
see
that
you
have
caught
up
with
me
cornelli
you
even
seem
to
be
further
along
than
i
am
just
the
same
you
must
not
come
late
to
your
meals
it
is
not
right
even
if
you
get
through
before
me
well
as
long
as
you
have
finished
you
can
take
this
letter
to
the
post
office
there
is
something
in
it
which
concerns
you
and
which
will
please
you
i
have
to
go
now
but
i
shall
tell
you
about
it
cornelli
was
given
the
letter
taking
the
remainder
of
her
apple
with
her
she
ran
outside
with
leaps
and
bounds
she
followed
the
rushing
till
the
narrow
path
reached
the
wide
country
road
here
stood
the
stately
inn
which
was
the
post
office
of
the
place
in
the
open
doorway
stood
the
smiling
and
rotund
wife
of
the
innkeeper
how
far
are
you
going
at
this
lively
pace
she
smilingly
asked
the
child
i
am
only
coming
to
you
cornelli
replied
she
was
very
much
out
of
breath
so
she
paused
before
adding
i
have
to
mail
a
letter
is
that
so
just
give
it
to
me
and
we
attend
to
it
said
the
woman
holding
the
hand
the
child
had
offered
her
she
added
you
are
well
off
cornelli
are
you
not
you
do
not
know
what
trouble
is
do
you
child
cornelli
shook
her
head
yes
of
course
and
why
should
you
it
does
one
good
to
see
your
bright
eyes
come
to
see
me
sometimes
i
like
to
see
a
happy
child
like
you
cornelli
replied
that
she
would
gladly
come
again
she
really
meant
to
do
so
for
the
woman
always
spoke
kindly
to
her
after
saying
she
ran
away
again
jumping
and
bounding
as
before
the
innkeeper
wife
meantime
muttered
to
herself
while
she
looked
after
cornelli
i
really
think
there
is
nothing
better
than
to
be
always
merry
the
contents
of
the
letter
which
the
little
girl
had
taken
to
be
mailed
were
as
follows
of
april
my
dear
cousin
my
trip
to
vienna
which
i
have
put
off
again
and
again
at
last
has
to
be
made
as
i
must
leave
in
the
near
future
i
am
asking
you
the
great
favor
of
spending
the
summer
here
to
superintend
my
household
i
am
counting
greatly
on
your
good
influence
on
my
child
who
has
had
practically
no
education
although
miss
mina
my
housekeeper
has
of
course
done
her
best
with
the
help
of
our
good
esther
who
reigns
in
the
kitchen
old
martha
a
former
nurse
of
my
poor
dead
wife
has
done
more
than
anybody
else
of
course
one
can
hardly
call
it
education
and
i
have
to
blame
myself
for
this
neglect
as
i
am
so
busy
with
my
affairs
i
do
not
see
much
of
my
child
besides
i
know
extremely
little
about
bringing
up
little
girls
there
is
no
greater
misfortune
than
the
loss
of
a
mother
especially
such
a
mother
as
my
cornelia
it
was
terrible
for
my
poor
child
to
lose
her
at
the
tender
age
of
three
please
bring
a
good
friend
with
you
so
that
you
wo
suffer
from
solitude
in
this
lonely
place
please
gladden
me
soon
by
your
arrival
and
oblige
your
sincere
cousin
frederick
hellmut
that
same
evening
when
director
hellmut
was
sitting
in
the
living
room
with
his
daughter
he
spoke
of
his
hope
that
a
cousin
of
his
miss
kitty
dorner
would
come
to
stay
in
while
he
was
on
his
trip
to
vienna
he
also
told
cornelli
to
be
glad
of
this
prospect
after
a
few
days
came
the
following
answer
b
the
of
may
my
dear
cousin
to
oblige
you
i
shall
spend
the
summer
at
your
house
i
have
already
planned
everything
and
i
have
asked
my
friend
miss
grideelen
to
accompany
me
i
am
very
grateful
that
you
realize
how
monotonous
it
would
have
been
for
me
to
stay
alone
in
your
house
all
summer
you
do
not
need
to
have
such
disturbing
thoughts
about
your
education
no
time
has
yet
been
lost
for
these
small
beings
do
not
need
the
best
of
care
at
the
start
they
require
that
only
when
they
are
ripe
enough
for
mental
influences
such
small
creatures
merely
vegetate
and
i
am
quite
sure
miss
mina
was
the
right
person
to
look
after
the
child
and
proper
nourishment
esther
who
you
say
is
very
reliable
too
has
probably
helped
in
taking
care
of
the
child
as
much
as
was
necessary
the
time
may
however
have
come
now
when
the
child
is
in
need
of
a
proper
influence
in
her
education
we
shall
not
arrive
before
the
last
week
of
this
month
for
it
would
be
inconvenient
for
me
to
come
sooner
with
best
regards
i
am
your
cousin
kitty
dorner
your
cousin
is
really
coming
cornelli
and
i
am
certain
that
you
are
happy
now
said
her
father
he
had
read
the
letter
while
they
were
having
supper
another
lady
is
coming
too
and
with
their
arrival
a
new
delightful
life
will
begin
for
you
cornelli
who
had
never
before
heard
anything
about
this
relation
of
her
father
felt
no
joy
at
this
news
she
did
not
see
anything
pleasing
in
the
prospect
on
the
contrary
it
only
meant
a
change
in
the
household
which
she
did
not
in
the
least
desire
she
wanted
everything
to
remain
as
it
was
she
had
no
other
wish
cornelli
saw
her
father
only
at
meals
for
he
spent
all
the
rest
of
his
time
in
his
business
offices
and
in
the
extensive
works
but
the
child
never
felt
lonely
or
forsaken
she
always
had
many
plans
and
there
was
hardly
a
moment
when
she
was
not
occupied
her
time
between
school
hours
always
seemed
much
too
short
and
the
evenings
only
were
half
as
long
as
she
wanted
them
to
be
it
was
then
that
she
loved
to
walk
and
roam
around
her
father
had
barely
left
the
room
when
she
again
ran
outside
and
as
usual
down
the
path
at
that
moment
the
energetic
esther
was
coming
from
the
garden
with
a
large
basket
on
her
arm
she
had
wisely
picked
some
vegetables
for
the
following
day
do
go
out
again
cornelli
she
said
just
look
at
the
gray
clouds
above
the
mountain
i
am
afraid
we
shall
have
a
thunderstorm
oh
i
just
have
to
go
to
martha
replied
cornelli
quickly
i
must
tell
her
something
and
i
do
think
a
storm
will
come
so
soon
of
course
it
wo
come
for
a
long
while
called
miss
mina
through
the
open
door
she
had
overheard
the
warning
and
had
stepped
outside
to
say
just
go
to
martha
cornelli
the
storm
wo
come
for
a
long
time
i
am
sure
so
the
child
flew
away
while
esther
passed
miss
mina
silently
shrugging
her
shoulders
that
was
always
the
way
it
happened
when
cornelli
wanted
anything
if
miss
mina
thought
that
something
should
not
be
done
esther
always
arrived
saying
that
nothing
on
earth
would
be
easier
than
to
do
that
very
thing
or
if
she
thought
that
cornelli
should
not
do
a
thing
miss
mina
always
helped
to
have
it
put
through
the
reason
for
this
was
a
very
simple
one
each
of
them
wanted
to
be
the
favorite
with
the
child
cornelli
arriving
at
martha
house
shot
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
little
room
full
of
excitement
she
called
out
just
think
martha
two
strange
people
are
coming
to
our
house
they
are
two
ladies
from
the
city
and
father
said
that
i
should
be
glad
but
i
am
not
a
bit
glad
for
i
do
not
know
them
would
you
be
glad
martha
if
two
new
people
suddenly
came
to
visit
you
the
child
had
to
take
a
deep
breath
she
had
been
running
fast
and
had
spoken
terribly
quickly
just
sit
down
here
with
me
cornelli
and
get
your
breath
again
said
martha
quietly
i
am
sure
that
somebody
is
coming
whom
your
father
loves
otherwise
he
would
not
tell
you
to
be
glad
when
you
know
them
i
am
sure
you
will
feel
happy
yes
perhaps
but
what
are
you
writing
martha
i
have
never
before
seen
you
write
said
the
child
full
of
interest
for
her
thoughts
had
been
suddenly
turned
writing
is
not
easy
for
me
answered
martha
and
you
could
do
it
so
much
better
than
i
can
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
have
written
anything
just
give
it
to
me
martha
and
i
write
for
you
if
you
will
only
tell
me
what
cornelli
readily
took
hold
of
the
pen
and
dipped
it
into
the
bottom
of
the
inkstand
i
tell
you
about
it
and
then
you
can
write
it
in
your
own
way
i
am
sure
that
you
can
do
it
better
than
i
can
said
martha
quite
relieved
she
had
been
sitting
for
a
long
time
with
a
pen
in
her
hand
absolutely
unable
to
find
any
beginning
you
see
cornelli
she
began
i
have
been
getting
along
so
well
with
my
work
lately
that
i
have
been
able
to
buy
a
bed
for
a
long
time
i
have
wanted
to
do
that
for
i
already
had
a
table
and
two
chairs
besides
an
old
wardrobe
now
i
have
put
them
all
into
my
little
room
upstairs
so
that
i
can
take
somebody
in
for
the
summer
sometimes
delicate
ladies
or
children
come
out
of
town
to
the
country
and
i
could
take
such
good
care
of
them
i
am
always
at
home
and
i
could
do
my
usual
work
besides
you
see
cornelli
i
wanted
to
put
this
in
the
paper
but
i
do
not
know
how
to
do
it
and
how
to
begin
oh
i
write
it
so
plainly
that
somebody
is
sure
to
come
right
away
cornelli
replied
full
of
zeal
but
first
of
all
let
us
look
at
the
little
room
i
am
awfully
anxious
to
see
it
martha
was
quite
willing
so
she
led
the
way
up
a
narrow
stairway
into
the
little
chamber
oh
how
fine
it
is
how
lovely
exclaimed
cornelli
running
full
of
admiration
from
one
corner
to
the
other
martha
had
in
truth
fixed
it
so
daintily
that
it
looked
extremely
pleasing
around
the
windows
she
had
arranged
curtains
of
some
thin
white
material
with
tiny
blue
flowers
and
the
same
material
had
been
used
to
cover
an
old
wooden
case
this
she
had
fixed
as
a
dainty
washstand
the
bed
and
two
old
chairs
were
likewise
covered
the
whole
effect
was
very
cheerful
and
inviting
oh
how
pretty
cornelli
exclaimed
over
and
over
again
how
could
you
ever
do
it
martha
or
have
so
much
money
oh
no
no
it
was
not
much
but
just
enough
for
the
bed
and
a
little
piece
of
material
i
got
the
stuff
very
cheap
because
it
was
a
remnant
so
you
really
do
not
think
it
is
bad
child
do
you
think
that
somebody
would
like
to
live
here
martha
was
examining
every
object
she
had
so
carefully
worked
over
yes
of
course
martha
you
can
believe
me
cornelli
replied
reassuringly
i
should
just
love
to
come
right
away
if
i
did
not
live
here
already
but
now
i
shall
write
for
i
know
exactly
what
i
shall
say
cornelli
running
down
stairs
dipped
her
pen
into
the
ink
and
began
to
write
but
do
not
forget
to
say
that
it
is
in
the
country
and
tell
the
name
of
the
place
here
so
that
they
can
find
me
said
martha
fearing
she
had
set
cornelli
a
very
difficult
task
that
is
true
i
have
to
say
that
too
remarked
cornelli
when
she
had
written
the
ending
she
began
to
read
aloud
if
somebody
should
want
a
nice
room
he
can
have
it
with
martha
wolf
she
will
take
good
care
of
delicate
ladies
or
children
and
will
see
that
they
will
be
comfortable
everything
is
very
neat
and
there
are
lovely
new
blue
and
white
covers
on
everything
it
is
in
the
country
in
beside
the
quite
near
the
large
iron
works
martha
was
thoroughly
pleased
you
have
said
everything
so
clearly
that
one
can
easily
understand
it
she
remarked
i
could
not
have
said
it
myself
you
see
for
it
would
have
seemed
like
boasting
now
if
i
only
knew
where
to
send
it
for
the
paper
i
do
not
know
quite
what
address
to
write
on
it
oh
i
know
quite
well
what
to
do
cornelli
reassured
her
friend
i
shall
take
it
quickly
to
the
post
office
sometimes
when
i
have
taken
letters
there
i
have
heard
people
say
to
the
innkeeper
must
be
put
in
the
paper
then
he
took
it
and
said
look
after
it
now
i
shall
do
the
same
just
give
it
to
me
martha
once
more
the
woman
glanced
through
what
had
been
written
it
seemed
very
strange
to
her
that
her
name
was
going
to
appear
in
the
newspaper
but
of
course
it
was
necessary
no
no
my
good
child
she
replied
you
have
done
enough
for
me
now
you
have
helped
me
wonderfully
and
i
do
not
want
you
to
go
there
for
me
but
your
advice
is
good
and
i
shall
take
the
paper
there
myself
oh
yes
and
i
come
too
said
cornelli
delightedly
she
knew
no
greater
pleasure
than
to
take
a
walk
with
her
old
friend
for
martha
always
discovered
such
interesting
things
and
could
point
them
out
to
cornelli
telling
her
many
many
things
about
them
in
many
places
martha
would
be
reminded
of
cornelli
mother
then
with
great
tenderness
she
would
tell
the
child
about
her
martha
was
the
only
one
who
ever
talked
to
cornelli
about
her
mother
her
father
never
spoke
of
her
and
esther
who
had
been
in
their
service
for
a
long
time
always
replied
when
the
child
wanted
to
talk
to
her
about
her
mother
do
not
talk
please
it
only
makes
one
sad
people
should
stir
up
such
memories
so
you
are
coming
too
martha
said
happily
it
was
her
greatest
joy
to
take
a
walk
with
her
small
merry
companion
cornelli
hung
on
her
arm
and
together
they
wandered
forth
in
the
beautiful
evening
the
storm
clouds
had
passed
over
and
towards
the
west
the
sky
was
flaming
like
fiery
gold
do
you
think
martha
that
my
mother
can
see
the
golden
sky
as
well
from
inside
as
we
see
it
from
the
outside
asked
the
child
pointing
to
the
sunset
yes
i
am
quite
sure
of
that
cornelli
martha
eagerly
answered
if
our
dear
lord
lets
his
dwelling
glow
so
beautifully
from
outside
just
think
how
wonderful
it
must
be
inside
where
the
blessed
are
in
their
happiness
why
are
they
so
glad
cornelli
wanted
to
know
oh
because
they
are
freed
from
all
sorrow
and
pain
they
are
also
glad
because
they
know
that
every
pain
or
sorrow
their
loved
ones
on
earth
have
to
bear
is
only
a
means
to
bring
their
prayers
to
him
who
alone
can
guide
them
to
heaven
did
my
mother
pray
to
him
too
asked
cornelli
again
yes
yes
cornelli
you
can
be
sure
of
that
martha
reassured
her
your
mother
was
a
good
pious
lady
everybody
should
pray
to
be
able
to
go
where
she
is
the
two
now
reached
the
post
office
and
gave
their
message
to
the
innkeeper
and
postmaster
when
twilight
had
come
and
the
evening
bell
had
long
ago
rung
they
wandered
back
along
the
pleasant
valley
road
between
green
meadows
chapter
ii
up
in
the
top
story
one
bright
morning
in
may
a
portly
gentleman
leaning
heavily
on
a
cane
was
walking
up
the
narrow
city
street
the
houses
here
were
so
high
that
the
upper
windows
could
scarcely
be
seen
from
below
a
steep
rise
in
the
street
caused
the
gentleman
to
stop
from
time
to
time
to
get
his
breath
scrutinizing
the
house
numbers
he
said
to
himself
several
times
not
yet
not
yet
then
climbing
up
still
higher
he
at
last
reached
a
house
beside
whose
open
door
six
bells
were
hanging
the
gentleman
now
began
to
study
the
names
under
the
bells
meanwhile
gravely
shaking
his
head
for
he
did
not
seem
to
find
the
name
he
was
seeking
oh
dear
at
last
and
the
highest
one
up
too
he
sighed
while
he
entered
the
house
now
the
real
climbing
began
at
first
the
steps
though
rather
high
were
white
and
neat
but
after
a
while
they
became
dark
and
narrow
and
in
the
end
the
way
led
over
worn
uneven
steps
to
a
narrow
door
the
only
standing
room
was
on
the
last
small
step
is
this
a
cage
said
the
climber
to
himself
breathing
hard
and
holding
fast
to
the
railing
the
thin
and
creaking
steps
seemed
to
him
extremely
unsafe
after
he
had
pulled
the
the
door
opened
and
a
lady
dressed
in
black
stood
before
him
oh
is
it
you
kind
guardian
she
exclaimed
with
astonishment
i
am
so
sorry
that
you
had
to
come
up
these
winding
steps
she
added
for
she
noticed
that
the
stout
gentleman
had
to
wipe
his
face
after
the
great
exertion
i
should
have
been
very
glad
to
go
down
to
you
if
you
had
let
me
know
that
you
were
here
the
lady
meanwhile
had
led
the
gentleman
into
the
room
and
asked
him
to
seat
himself
as
your
guardian
i
simply
had
to
come
once
to
see
you
he
declared
seating
himself
on
an
old
sofa
and
still
leaning
with
both
hands
on
the
golden
knob
of
his
cane
i
have
to
tell
you
my
dear
halm
that
i
am
sorry
you
moved
to
town
you
should
have
followed
my
advice
and
lived
in
a
small
house
in
the
country
it
would
have
been
so
much
more
practical
for
you
than
to
live
in
this
garret
lodging
where
you
have
no
conveniences
whatever
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
country
air
would
have
been
much
better
for
both
you
and
the
children
i
could
not
think
about
conveniences
for
myself
when
my
husband
died
and
i
had
to
leave
the
parsonage
schaller
replied
the
lady
with
a
faint
smile
the
country
air
would
naturally
have
been
much
better
for
my
children
especially
for
my
older
boy
but
he
had
to
come
to
town
on
account
of
school
and
i
could
not
possibly
have
sent
him
away
from
me
delicate
as
he
is
besides
there
are
boarding
places
in
town
where
such
boys
are
well
taken
care
of
the
visitor
interrupted
what
other
reasons
did
you
have
my
girls
too
are
old
enough
to
learn
something
which
they
can
make
use
of
later
on
continued
the
lady
you
know
that
this
is
necessary
and
that
it
is
very
hard
to
get
such
opportunities
in
the
country
i
hope
i
have
persuaded
you
that
coming
to
town
with
the
children
was
not
a
foolish
undertaking
i
am
extremely
glad
that
you
have
given
me
an
opportunity
to
explain
why
i
did
not
follow
your
advice
what
are
your
daughters
going
to
learn
the
gentleman
asked
abruptly
nika
the
elder
paints
quite
well
replied
the
lady
and
agnes
has
a
decided
talent
for
music
if
both
girls
are
earnest
in
their
studies
they
hope
later
on
to
be
able
to
teach
indeed
they
are
very
anxious
to
do
so
these
arts
do
not
bring
good
returns
even
after
years
and
years
of
study
said
the
gentleman
it
would
be
much
more
sensible
for
the
sisters
to
busy
themselves
with
dressmaking
they
could
quickly
begin
a
business
in
which
they
might
help
each
other
and
make
some
money
this
would
really
help
both
you
and
your
son
a
great
deal
if
your
boy
is
going
to
study
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
he
can
be
independent
the
parson
widow
looked
sadly
in
front
of
her
without
saying
a
word
please
do
not
misunderstand
me
i
am
only
speaking
in
your
and
your
children
interest
the
gentleman
began
again
i
am
very
sorry
not
to
have
met
your
daughters
for
they
would
soon
have
agreed
with
me
if
they
had
heard
my
reasons
nowadays
young
people
understand
quite
well
what
it
means
to
make
one
way
easily
and
advantageously
you
can
be
sure
of
that
my
children
may
still
be
a
little
backward
in
this
knowledge
they
may
through
the
influence
of
their
parents
still
care
for
the
things
which
you
call
the
breadless
arts
said
the
lady
with
a
sigh
but
i
shall
make
my
children
acquainted
with
your
ideas
and
i
shall
try
to
speak
to
them
according
to
your
views
at
least
as
far
as
i
am
able
how
old
is
the
eldest
she
ought
to
be
old
enough
to
understand
my
reasons
remarked
the
gentleman
nika
is
in
her
fourteenth
year
her
education
is
of
course
still
incomplete
in
many
ways
replied
the
lady
dino
is
twelve
and
agnes
eleven
years
old
the
latter
must
first
of
all
complete
her
compulsory
school
years
still
rather
young
people
said
schaller
shaking
his
head
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
however
the
longer
their
education
will
take
the
shorter
should
be
the
ways
to
the
goal
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
my
advice
is
right
if
you
give
your
little
daughters
into
the
hands
of
a
clever
dressmaker
your
moving
to
the
city
will
have
been
of
some
real
use
in
his
great
zeal
to
convince
his
silent
listener
the
visitor
had
not
noticed
that
a
small
boy
had
entered
this
little
fellow
had
at
first
hidden
behind
his
mother
but
at
a
sign
from
her
approached
the
gentleman
he
noticed
the
child
only
when
a
small
fist
pushed
itself
forcibly
into
his
closed
right
hand
please
forgive
the
rather
aggressive
greeting
of
my
small
son
begged
the
mother
oh
here
is
another
still
i
knew
there
was
a
smaller
one
exclaimed
the
dismayed
visitor
well
boy
what
is
your
name
mux
was
the
reply
the
gentleman
looked
questioningly
at
the
mother
that
is
the
name
his
brother
and
sisters
have
given
him
and
the
one
which
seems
to
have
remained
quite
permanently
she
replied
his
name
is
really
marcus
and
he
is
just
five
years
old
well
well
and
what
do
you
want
to
be
when
you
grow
up
my
young
friend
asked
schaller
an
army
general
unhesitatingly
replied
the
small
boy
after
these
words
the
gentleman
got
up
it
seems
to
me
my
dear
halm
that
all
your
children
have
pretty
ideas
he
said
impressively
i
can
only
hope
that
before
long
they
will
learn
that
in
this
world
it
is
not
possible
for
everybody
to
do
what
he
pleases
the
mother
approved
this
good
wish
but
added
i
have
to
tell
you
though
that
mux
has
gotten
this
idea
from
his
favorite
book
where
the
picture
of
a
general
on
horseback
interests
him
more
than
anything
else
this
of
course
is
a
passing
impression
like
many
others
one
can
never
urge
proper
and
successful
work
too
soon
nor
too
often
please
do
not
overlook
that
my
friend
with
these
words
the
guardian
ended
the
interview
and
saying
carefully
descended
the
steep
staircase
just
then
a
child
was
running
up
the
stairs
so
quickly
that
it
actually
seemed
as
if
she
had
no
need
to
touch
the
steps
at
all
as
the
gentleman
was
taking
up
all
the
room
the
only
space
left
for
a
passage
was
under
the
arm
with
which
he
held
the
railing
here
the
lithe
creature
tried
to
slip
through
stop
stop
do
you
not
belong
to
the
parson
widow
mrs
halm
asked
the
gentleman
making
a
barrier
with
his
arm
yes
i
belong
to
her
was
the
quick
answer
and
stooping
down
still
lower
the
small
person
again
tried
to
pass
just
hold
still
one
moment
if
you
can
the
gentleman
now
demanded
you
probably
know
that
i
am
schaller
your
guardian
i
have
just
given
your
mother
some
advice
which
was
meant
for
your
good
you
do
not
look
in
the
least
stupid
so
you
can
help
to
persuade
your
mother
i
am
sure
you
can
understand
what
is
good
for
you
are
you
the
elder
no
the
younger
one
came
quickly
back
for
answer
so
much
the
better
then
the
elder
will
be
still
more
sensible
if
you
take
my
advice
you
can
both
contribute
to
the
prosperity
of
the
whole
family
with
these
words
the
gentleman
gave
the
little
girl
his
hand
and
went
away
agnes
flew
up
the
rest
of
the
stairs
and
into
the
narrow
hall
her
brother
mux
was
standing
expectantly
in
the
open
doorway
he
did
this
every
day
at
the
time
his
brother
and
sisters
were
coming
home
from
school
he
loved
the
change
that
their
coming
brought
after
the
quiet
morning
a
fat
gentleman
was
here
and
mother
said
afterward
god
and
you
ca
play
the
piano
any
more
he
reported
agnes
ran
into
the
next
room
and
as
quickly
out
again
where
is
mother
mother
mother
she
called
opening
one
door
after
another
here
i
am
agnes
but
do
not
be
so
violent
sounded
the
voice
from
the
kitchen
agnes
ran
to
her
mother
what
is
mux
saying
is
it
really
true
i
know
that
schaller
has
been
here
and
that
he
can
tell
us
what
we
have
to
do
what
did
he
say
is
it
really
true
what
mux
has
said
oh
i
never
eat
again
i
do
want
to
sleep
or
do
anything
any
more
everything
then
is
lost
agnes
was
frightfully
excited
her
cheeks
were
dark
red
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
shoot
forth
flashes
of
lightning
but
child
you
must
not
speak
this
way
do
not
get
so
terribly
excited
the
mother
calmly
admonished
her
there
is
no
time
now
to
discuss
a
subject
which
we
have
to
talk
over
quietly
we
shall
do
so
you
know
perfectly
well
that
i
have
the
greatest
sympathy
for
your
wishes
and
ambitions
and
that
it
means
as
much
to
me
as
to
you
as
soon
as
we
have
a
quiet
hour
together
we
can
talk
it
all
over
these
words
quieted
the
child
she
knew
that
her
mother
always
shared
every
experience
with
them
in
coming
to
town
mother
and
daughter
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
carry
out
their
most
fervent
wish
namely
the
completion
of
agnes
musical
education
agnes
could
count
on
her
mother
help
it
was
for
the
happiness
of
both
of
them
so
agnes
went
out
to
the
kitchen
to
do
her
work
as
usual
both
the
sisters
always
helped
to
lighten
their
mother
work
for
their
only
servant
was
quite
a
young
girl
who
did
not
do
much
besides
run
errands
mux
went
back
to
his
former
place
he
was
intensely
pleased
with
the
great
effect
and
excitement
his
words
had
produced
on
agnes
hearing
somebody
else
coming
upstairs
he
prepared
to
repeat
his
speech
when
nika
was
near
enough
to
hear
him
he
said
a
fat
gentleman
has
been
here
and
when
he
was
gone
mother
said
god
and
you
are
not
to
paint
any
more
trees
and
flowers
nika
not
having
seen
schaller
did
not
understand
these
words
unruffled
and
silent
she
passed
mux
and
went
into
the
other
room
which
disappointed
mux
terribly
so
when
he
heard
dino
coming
up
the
stairs
he
unloaded
his
disappointment
on
him
we
are
not
going
to
have
them
he
announced
what
do
you
think
we
will
have
what
am
i
supposed
to
be
thinking
of
little
guesser
dino
called
out
oh
i
know
whenever
you
think
we
are
going
to
have
green
peas
for
lunch
you
run
up
very
quickly
you
ca
even
wait
you
love
them
so
mux
asserted
but
we
wo
have
any
for
we
are
going
to
have
cabbage
instead
there
now
you
have
it
now
come
in
and
we
see
who
makes
a
worse
face
about
it
you
or
i
with
these
words
dino
took
his
little
brother
hand
and
together
they
ran
into
the
room
very
soon
afterwards
the
family
all
sat
down
to
their
meal
on
most
days
the
children
would
be
telling
their
mother
about
the
happenings
of
the
morning
they
would
all
talk
at
once
until
it
was
quite
hard
for
her
to
do
them
all
justice
but
it
was
different
it
seemed
as
if
a
storm
was
in
the
air
everybody
was
silent
and
on
all
faces
except
one
heavy
clouds
seemed
to
be
resting
nika
sat
brooding
and
staring
in
front
of
her
for
agnes
had
interpreted
to
her
their
little
brother
words
she
swallowed
very
hard
on
every
mouthful
because
she
had
to
swallow
a
great
deal
more
besides
agnes
was
frowning
so
that
her
whole
forehead
was
like
one
huge
wrinkle
the
mother
too
was
busy
with
deep
thoughts
as
one
could
see
from
her
worried
expression
mux
who
generally
was
extremely
talkative
was
quietly
nibbling
on
his
dish
of
cabbage
with
many
a
deep
sigh
dino
alone
was
merry
he
glanced
with
great
expectation
from
one
to
the
other
and
his
lunch
did
not
keep
him
very
busy
i
am
expecting
a
thunderstorm
he
said
while
the
quiet
was
still
unbroken
nika
is
going
to
let
loose
the
lightning
which
is
flashing
under
her
lashes
and
agnes
will
follow
with
the
thunder
after
this
i
predict
a
heavy
rainstorm
for
mux
can
hardly
keep
back
his
tears
about
this
cabbage
but
you
have
eaten
much
less
cabbage
than
i
have
mux
cried
out
i
do
this
only
from
moderation
my
little
man
so
that
nobody
will
get
too
little
i
would
answer
you
about
the
thunder
and
the
cabbage
dino
if
i
had
time
agnes
at
last
exploded
but
i
have
a
music
lesson
at
one
and
i
have
enough
to
swallow
without
this
horrid
cabbage
i
only
wish
you
could
be
more
moderate
in
other
things
instead
of
in
eating
dino
said
the
mother
with
a
melancholy
smile
you
have
hardly
eaten
anything
and
i
heard
you
cough
all
night
your
health
worries
me
dreadfully
dino
did
you
cough
much
in
school
this
morning
certainly
mother
but
that
is
nothing
to
worry
about
dino
replied
merrily
it
always
goes
away
again
my
professor
said
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
me
to
remain
in
the
pastoral
fields
of
my
native
village
than
to
have
sought
the
corners
of
town
but
i
answered
the
latin
language
does
not
sprout
from
the
pastoral
fields
professor
oh
i
hope
you
did
not
answer
that
the
mother
said
quite
frightened
oh
yes
but
only
in
my
thoughts
please
mother
do
worry
about
me
dino
implored
i
am
afraid
that
your
professor
is
right
the
mother
said
with
a
sigh
but
i
have
a
plan
which
we
shall
talk
over
i
shall
also
talk
over
our
guardian
proposal
girls
please
try
not
to
look
so
terribly
unhappy
for
everything
is
not
yet
lost
oh
it
will
come
to
that
in
the
end
said
nika
leaving
the
room
yes
and
much
worse
i
guess
said
agnes
violently
pushing
her
chair
in
place
she
departed
after
thrusting
her
music
into
a
folder
what
can
be
worse
than
when
all
is
lost
dino
called
after
her
i
know
what
responded
mux
knowingly
while
agnes
looked
back
at
dino
as
if
to
say
if
i
had
time
i
certainly
would
give
an
answer
to
you
what
is
it
wise
little
man
asked
dino
if
she
had
to
eat
nothing
but
cabbage
all
the
time
replied
mux
full
of
a
conviction
which
he
seemed
to
have
acquired
from
his
own
experience
dino
too
prepared
to
depart
with
a
sorrowful
look
the
mother
passed
her
hand
over
the
boy
thick
hair
please
be
careful
and
do
not
run
too
fast
she
begged
it
very
bad
for
you
to
sit
in
the
cool
school
room
when
you
are
so
overheated
i
can
scarcely
ever
see
you
go
without
anxiety
but
i
am
surely
not
as
sick
as
that
little
mother
dino
said
tenderly
embracing
her
when
somebody
has
a
cough
it
always
goes
away
again
after
a
while
that
is
the
way
with
me
be
merry
and
everything
will
be
all
right
in
the
end
but
i
have
to
go
now
it
is
late
he
exclaimed
but
do
not
hurry
so
terribly
dino
there
is
time
enough
yet
and
remember
what
i
told
you
she
called
after
him
then
stepping
to
the
open
window
she
followed
the
running
boy
down
the
street
with
her
eyes
dino
gave
halm
great
anxiety
for
he
seemed
more
delicate
every
day
her
watchful
eye
had
detected
how
poor
his
appetite
had
been
lately
despite
that
the
boy
had
a
very
sweet
disposition
and
was
always
full
of
fun
he
was
always
anxious
to
have
everybody
in
a
good
humor
and
above
all
his
mother
of
all
the
burdens
she
had
to
bear
the
trouble
about
her
son
health
was
the
hardest
one
could
see
this
by
the
painful
expression
on
her
face
when
she
left
the
window
and
sat
down
beside
her
work
table
mux
was
just
repeating
a
question
for
the
third
time
but
his
mother
did
not
hear
him
loudly
raising
his
voice
he
said
once
more
oh
mother
why
does
one
have
to
eat
what
the
cows
get
what
do
you
mean
mux
what
are
you
talking
about
she
asked
i
saw
it
in
my
picture
book
the
leaves
the
cows
get
are
just
the
same
as
those
in
the
kitchen
he
explained
none
too
clearly
but
the
mother
understood
him
directly
she
remembered
how
interestedly
he
had
looked
at
the
cabbage
leaves
when
the
girl
had
brought
them
home
from
market
she
also
bore
in
mind
a
picture
in
his
favorite
book
where
a
stable
boy
was
shown
giving
a
glossy
brown
cow
splendid
green
leaves
to
eat
so
you
still
have
the
cabbage
in
your
head
mux
said
the
mother
you
must
not
be
dissatisfied
when
there
are
so
many
poor
children
who
have
to
go
hungry
while
you
get
bread
and
good
vegetables
they
may
be
suffering
oh
ca
we
send
them
the
rest
of
the
cabbage
mux
quickly
suggested
come
and
work
on
the
embroidery
i
have
started
for
you
mux
we
shall
see
who
can
beat
perhaps
that
will
clear
away
your
thoughts
about
the
cabbage
come
and
sit
beside
me
mux
the
mother
put
a
little
chair
beside
hers
and
placed
the
work
in
the
boy
nimble
fingers
now
a
race
with
stitches
began
and
in
his
zeal
to
beat
his
mother
he
at
last
forgot
the
subject
that
had
troubled
him
so
much
the
late
evening
had
come
and
the
children
work
for
school
was
done
halm
put
the
big
mending
basket
away
and
took
up
her
knitting
the
time
had
come
when
clustering
eagerly
about
their
mother
the
children
told
her
all
the
troubles
and
joys
of
the
day
it
was
the
hardest
hour
of
the
day
for
mux
for
it
was
his
bedtime
his
mother
always
took
him
by
the
hand
to
lead
him
to
bed
before
she
began
to
talk
with
the
three
elder
children
every
evening
he
put
up
a
fight
for
the
wily
youngster
always
thought
that
by
obstinate
resistance
he
could
break
the
rule
his
mother
however
knew
well
that
his
success
would
only
result
in
dreadful
yawns
and
heavy
eyes
this
evening
he
found
himself
ready
for
bed
before
he
had
had
time
to
prepare
for
his
fight
his
mother
seemed
anxious
to
have
him
in
bed
punctually
that
night
the
boy
was
always
reconciled
to
his
fate
when
she
sat
down
a
moment
beside
his
bed
to
hear
of
anything
that
might
be
troubling
him
mux
knowing
that
all
conversation
was
irrevocably
closed
after
his
prayers
were
said
would
try
every
night
to
prolong
this
period
after
mux
had
climbed
into
bed
he
said
thoughtfully
do
you
think
mother
that
if
people
planted
cherries
where
cabbage
now
grows
everybody
could
eat
cherries
instead
of
cabbage
we
simply
have
to
stop
now
mux
halm
replied
to
his
astonishment
for
he
had
hoped
to
start
a
long
conversation
well
mux
you
do
seem
to
be
able
to
get
over
the
cabbage
go
to
sleep
for
you
have
talked
enough
about
it
mux
knew
then
that
nothing
could
be
done
that
day
after
his
evening
prayer
and
a
kiss
from
his
mother
he
lay
down
and
was
fast
asleep
before
his
mother
had
even
shut
the
door
agnes
had
just
finished
her
last
task
and
was
throwing
her
books
into
a
drawer
each
more
violently
than
the
other
she
was
still
terribly
excited
and
as
soon
as
her
mother
came
back
to
the
room
she
burst
forth
oh
mother
if
i
am
not
allowed
to
study
music
any
more
i
would
rather
stop
learning
anything
why
ca
i
become
a
servant
girl
i
could
do
the
work
well
enough
as
soon
as
i
have
earned
enough
money
i
buy
a
harp
and
then
i
can
wander
from
house
to
house
singing
and
playing
i
can
easily
live
like
that
nobody
needs
to
be
a
dressmaker
people
can
wear
petticoats
and
jackets
that
is
enough
and
those
can
be
woven
all
other
children
are
better
off
than
we
are
they
can
learn
what
they
please
and
we
ca
learn
anything
an
outburst
of
tears
choked
all
further
words
during
her
sister
speech
nika
had
been
quietly
drawing
but
she
was
holding
her
head
lower
and
lower
over
her
work
without
once
looking
up
she
continued
her
studies
but
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
filling
pushing
her
work
away
she
held
her
handkerchief
before
her
face
oh
children
said
the
mother
looking
sadly
at
them
do
not
be
so
desperate
right
away
you
know
that
your
good
is
my
good
as
well
and
that
i
am
doing
and
shall
keep
on
doing
everything
in
my
power
to
fulfill
your
ambitions
it
would
be
my
happiest
joy
to
have
your
talents
developed
so
that
you
could
devote
all
your
lives
to
music
and
painting
if
we
should
find
it
impossible
however
dear
children
we
must
firmly
believe
that
it
would
not
have
been
for
the
best
had
we
succeeded
for
god
alone
knows
which
way
to
lead
us
do
not
lose
your
confidence
in
a
kind
father
in
heaven
for
that
is
our
greatest
consolation
he
wo
forget
us
if
we
do
not
forget
him
and
we
must
remember
that
he
can
see
further
than
we
can
for
he
knows
why
and
where
he
is
leading
us
we
can
not
look
into
the
future
but
later
we
shall
understand
it
all
and
realize
why
we
had
to
bear
our
troubles
out
of
them
will
come
the
greatest
blessings
now
let
us
be
happy
again
and
let
us
sing
a
song
said
dino
who
loved
to
be
gay
and
who
liked
to
see
everyone
about
him
merry
too
let
us
sing
if
winter
storms
are
wild
and
long
we
know
that
spring
is
coming
to
agnes
whom
i
hear
rebel
this
consolation
i
here
tell
yes
dino
it
is
easy
enough
for
you
to
laugh
agnes
exclaimed
you
would
probably
whistle
another
tune
if
you
had
to
become
a
tailor
but
you
can
learn
and
study
everything
you
want
to
i
shall
certainly
not
study
everything
dino
informed
her
but
your
singing
is
much
nicer
than
your
arguing
agnes
so
please
begin
and
if
you
do
like
my
song
you
can
start
another
we
shall
all
sing
together
later
on
children
said
the
mother
i
have
to
speak
to
you
too
dino
i
am
troubled
about
your
cough
and
your
health
i
have
looked
about
for
quite
a
while
to
find
a
suitable
place
in
the
country
where
i
could
send
you
of
course
there
are
plenty
of
places
but
i
want
you
to
go
into
some
modest
house
where
you
can
be
looked
after
i
found
a
notice
in
the
paper
which
might
be
just
what
i
am
looking
for
read
it
yourself
dino
dino
began
to
read
yes
yes
mother
i
must
go
there
he
said
shaking
with
merriment
i
must
go
to
martha
in
i
am
sure
that
it
is
very
cosy
in
martha
wolf
house
where
everything
is
so
neat
and
the
covers
are
so
fresh
the
sisters
now
wanted
also
to
see
the
notice
that
made
dino
laugh
so
heartily
he
read
the
paragraph
aloud
about
martha
wolf
in
and
they
all
agreed
that
it
would
be
pleasant
there
the
mother
decided
to
write
to
the
woman
at
once
and
to
take
dino
there
as
soon
as
possible
now
we
shall
sing
a
song
to
end
the
day
she
said
sitting
down
at
the
old
piano
every
day
the
children
sang
an
evening
song
to
her
accompaniment
opening
the
book
she
herself
started
and
the
three
children
took
up
the
song
with
their
pure
fresh
voices
when
bowed
with
grief
go
seek
relief
of
god
our
lord
above
up
in
the
top
story
thy
need
has
grown
when
left
alone
for
great
and
helping
love
before
said
before
prayed
he
knows
thy
inmost
need
and
by
his
care
his
love
so
rare
from
sorrow
thou
art
freed
chapter
iii
new
appearances
in
in
the
director
house
in
reigned
great
excitement
the
day
had
come
when
the
two
ladies
from
town
were
expected
to
arrive
for
their
lengthy
stay
to
celebrate
the
coming
of
his
guests
the
master
of
the
house
had
ordered
a
festive
dinner
for
the
middle
of
the
day
he
had
been
longing
for
this
day
so
was
in
a
splendid
humor
it
was
very
important
for
him
to
start
on
his
journey
right
away
and
he
had
waited
only
to
be
able
formally
to
receive
his
visitors
also
he
had
promised
his
cousin
to
give
the
reins
of
the
household
into
her
hands
himself
after
which
event
he
had
planned
to
start
on
his
journey
to
cornelli
the
preparations
for
the
arrival
of
the
new
members
of
the
household
seemed
very
annoying
everything
being
different
from
usual
she
commonly
very
much
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
company
for
on
such
occasions
she
paid
frequent
visits
to
the
kitchen
where
esther
was
always
busy
cooking
as
soon
as
cornelli
appeared
in
the
doorway
esther
would
call
to
her
come
and
see
which
you
like
best
cornelli
i
am
sure
they
are
not
so
bad
a
small
yellow
apple
tart
and
a
round
purple
plum
cake
were
ready
for
the
child
to
taste
for
her
visit
had
been
anticipated
cornelli
always
assured
the
cook
that
the
apple
tarts
were
excellent
and
the
plum
cakes
even
better
then
cornelli
would
go
into
the
pantry
where
miss
mina
was
fixing
fruit
on
the
crystal
platters
here
many
a
raisin
and
almond
would
drop
beside
the
plate
and
from
there
find
its
way
into
pocket
it
was
pleasant
to
have
a
supply
whenever
she
felt
like
eating
the
housekeeper
dropped
many
nuts
on
purpose
for
she
did
not
want
to
be
less
sought
after
than
her
rival
in
the
kitchen
esther
was
flying
around
the
kitchen
violently
rattling
her
pots
and
pans
and
when
cornelli
appeared
to
see
what
was
going
on
the
cook
called
to
her
off
with
you
i
have
nothing
for
you
here
the
ladies
from
town
must
not
think
that
they
have
to
show
me
how
to
cook
a
good
dinner
i
show
them
go
away
and
make
room
here
for
me
make
room
cornelli
i
have
to
fix
the
vegetables
cornelli
ran
to
the
pantry
mina
was
just
building
up
a
splendid
pile
of
cookies
and
almond
rings
do
come
rushing
in
like
that
or
it
will
all
tumble
down
she
objected
do
come
so
near
to
the
table
this
plate
is
all
ready
and
nothing
must
be
missing
from
it
i
wo
have
it
said
that
one
can
see
there
is
no
mistress
in
this
house
and
that
nobody
here
knows
how
to
set
a
table
if
you
are
all
so
stingy
i
wo
bother
you
any
more
said
cornelli
and
with
these
words
she
turned
around
and
marched
indignantly
out
of
the
house
that
moment
hearing
the
sound
of
approaching
wheels
and
looking
down
the
road
through
the
open
place
in
front
of
the
house
she
spied
the
expected
carriage
with
two
ladies
sitting
in
it
matthew
matthew
she
called
out
in
the
direction
of
the
large
stable
and
the
barn
these
lay
a
little
distance
from
the
house
and
were
hidden
by
trees
matthew
was
the
gardener
who
looked
after
the
horses
and
had
also
to
superintend
all
the
work
done
by
his
assistant
in
the
garden
and
the
stable
he
was
cornelli
special
friend
whom
she
had
known
ever
since
she
could
remember
for
he
had
served
her
grandfather
he
now
came
from
the
stable
and
mysteriously
beckoned
to
her
come
here
quickly
run
fast
he
said
we
still
get
to
the
carriage
in
time
only
come
for
a
moment
cornelli
ran
to
him
and
looking
into
the
stable
saw
lying
on
soft
fresh
hay
a
tiny
kid
it
looked
like
a
toy
but
was
really
alive
oh
where
did
it
come
from
matthew
oh
how
cunning
it
is
the
white
fine
fur
is
just
like
silk
can
it
walk
alone
can
it
stand
too
if
it
wants
to
oh
just
see
how
friendly
it
is
and
how
it
is
rubbing
its
little
head
against
me
yes
but
come
now
the
carriage
is
driving
up
matthew
urged
come
quickly
you
can
see
it
every
day
just
think
it
was
only
born
the
carriage
had
just
driven
into
the
court
and
matthew
was
there
the
moment
the
horses
stopped
the
director
was
there
too
not
to
lose
any
time
and
yet
not
be
tardy
he
had
put
a
watcher
at
the
door
to
let
him
know
when
the
carriage
was
approaching
the
director
was
very
polite
and
lifted
his
cousin
out
of
the
carriage
greeting
her
heartily
then
he
helped
miss
grideelen
to
dismount
thanking
her
warmly
for
coming
he
told
her
how
glad
he
was
that
she
had
been
willing
to
follow
his
cousin
into
this
solitude
for
otherwise
it
would
have
worried
him
to
leave
her
alone
so
long
he
appreciated
their
great
sacrifice
in
coming
and
he
hoped
that
his
trip
which
was
very
urgent
would
not
keep
him
away
too
long
where
is
your
daughter
frederick
asked
miss
dorner
now
the
director
glanced
about
i
saw
her
just
a
moment
ago
where
are
you
cornelli
he
called
towards
the
house
here
i
am
it
sounded
from
very
near
for
cornelli
had
hidden
behind
her
father
so
as
to
inspect
the
new
arrivals
without
being
seen
herself
come
forward
and
speak
to
your
cousin
and
to
miss
grideelen
ordered
hellmut
cornelli
gave
her
hand
first
to
her
relative
and
then
to
the
other
lady
saying
to
each
how
do
you
do
you
can
call
me
cousin
and
this
lady
is
called
miss
grideelen
said
the
cousin
hoping
that
the
child
would
repeat
her
greeting
and
would
call
her
and
her
friend
by
the
names
she
was
just
told
to
use
in
speaking
to
them
but
the
child
did
not
say
another
word
the
director
now
turned
towards
the
carriage
giving
matthew
instructions
for
the
horses
then
everybody
stepped
into
the
house
and
soon
the
whole
company
sat
down
at
the
richly
laden
dinner
table
miss
mina
earned
many
praises
for
the
deliciously
planned
meal
when
the
afternoon
came
the
host
took
the
ladies
around
his
place
for
his
cousin
was
anxious
to
become
acquainted
with
everything
she
had
to
take
care
of
oh
what
an
abundance
of
fruit
miss
grideelen
exclaimed
over
and
over
again
how
many
cherry
trees
and
what
enormous
apple
trees
oh
what
a
row
of
pear
trees
you
must
be
able
to
fill
your
bins
with
fruit
in
the
autumn
hellmut
where
do
you
have
room
for
it
all
i
do
not
know
about
it
my
servants
take
care
of
that
for
i
have
no
time
it
is
a
great
shame
frederick
that
you
do
not
have
half
a
dozen
children
they
would
help
to
look
after
these
matters
the
cousin
remarked
by
the
way
i
wonder
where
your
child
is
she
does
not
seem
to
be
very
sociable
i
do
not
know
where
she
is
replied
hellmut
i
am
generally
at
work
about
this
time
and
mina
probably
knows
what
she
is
doing
perhaps
she
is
busy
with
her
teacher
cornelli
has
been
alone
so
much
that
she
could
not
get
very
sociable
that
is
why
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
both
for
coming
i
am
so
glad
she
can
at
last
be
in
the
environment
i
have
always
wanted
for
her
but
what
could
i
do
i
have
twice
taken
governesses
into
the
house
to
supply
her
with
proper
intercourse
and
opportunity
for
study
the
first
ran
away
because
she
could
not
stand
the
solitude
the
second
wanted
every
servant
to
leave
who
had
been
here
before
her
esther
was
to
go
and
even
matthew
she
told
me
that
i
had
to
choose
between
her
and
the
as
she
called
them
i
showed
no
desire
to
send
either
of
them
away
and
said
to
her
is
better
for
you
to
go
for
when
the
two
have
departed
it
will
probably
be
my
turn
next
as
i
shall
be
the
oldest
left
after
that
she
departed
and
i
had
no
more
courage
to
go
through
another
experience
but
i
knew
that
it
was
time
for
cornelli
to
have
a
lady
of
refinement
and
culture
with
her
i
am
sure
dear
cousin
that
you
can
give
me
some
good
advice
as
to
her
education
as
soon
as
you
have
become
acquainted
with
her
i
should
like
to
know
whom
she
resembles
said
miss
dorner
she
does
not
seem
to
resemble
either
you
or
your
late
wife
do
you
think
so
replied
the
father
quickly
do
you
really
think
so
the
child
certainly
does
not
need
to
resemble
me
but
i
have
always
hoped
that
she
resembled
her
mother
i
always
hoped
that
this
would
increase
with
the
years
and
that
she
would
grow
up
to
be
my
image
do
you
not
think
that
she
has
cornelia
eyes
i
think
that
my
child
rather
straggly
mane
will
in
time
resemble
my
beautiful
brown
hair
the
child
hair
is
very
thick
and
has
just
the
same
color
the
director
looked
imploringly
at
his
cousin
he
seemed
anxious
for
her
to
agree
with
him
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
replied
i
certainly
see
no
resemblance
between
the
tousled
looking
small
savage
and
cornelia
the
latter
always
was
so
lovely
in
her
exquisite
neatness
her
eyes
always
glowed
with
happiness
and
seemed
to
smile
at
one
from
under
her
beautiful
wavy
brown
hair
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
your
child
is
not
exactly
engaging
she
resembles
a
wild
and
furious
little
kitten
with
bristling
hair
she
seems
to
me
to
be
always
making
a
round
back
she
looks
as
if
she
wanted
to
jump
at
one
and
scratch
no
no
she
does
not
do
that
the
director
assured
the
child
is
not
in
the
least
at
least
i
do
not
think
so
but
i
am
afraid
that
you
are
right
in
saying
that
she
does
not
resemble
her
mother
in
the
least
her
education
i
mean
her
lack
of
education
may
have
something
to
do
with
it
that
is
why
i
am
so
grateful
to
you
both
for
coming
here
i
am
sure
that
with
your
influence
the
child
will
change
and
gain
much
and
i
do
not
think
that
it
will
be
hard
for
cornelli
to
learn
i
can
travel
now
with
a
light
heart
cousin
for
i
know
that
i
can
leave
my
child
the
house
and
the
servants
in
your
care
you
do
not
know
in
what
a
difficult
position
i
am
sometimes
i
ought
to
go
away
frequently
and
am
not
able
to
do
so
because
there
is
nobody
to
take
care
of
the
house
for
me
the
servants
have
to
be
kept
in
good
humor
and
the
house
has
to
be
ruled
with
authority
and
judgment
i
can
not
thank
you
enough
for
making
this
trip
possible
for
me
when
they
had
returned
from
their
walk
they
separated
hellmut
had
still
plenty
of
preparations
to
make
for
his
journey
and
the
ladies
retired
to
their
rooms
to
get
settled
there
at
supper
everybody
met
again
the
ladies
and
their
host
appeared
punctually
and
dinner
was
served
at
once
where
is
your
daughter
does
she
not
come
to
supper
too
asked
miss
dorner
yes
of
course
do
you
know
where
she
is
miss
mina
the
father
asked
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
and
cornelli
with
cheeks
aglow
ran
into
the
room
she
sat
down
quickly
at
her
seat
did
you
creep
through
a
hedge
the
cousin
asked
her
no
i
was
in
the
hen
house
replied
cornelli
that
is
no
reason
to
look
the
way
you
do
go
to
your
room
first
and
have
your
hair
combed
by
miss
mina
she
will
also
give
you
some
soap
for
this
is
quite
necessary
cornelli
glanced
at
her
father
this
was
something
new
and
she
waited
for
his
approval
quickly
cornelli
why
do
you
hesitate
he
admonished
her
you
have
to
obey
your
cousin
absolutely
for
she
is
taking
my
place
now
i
hope
that
everybody
here
understands
that
clearly
he
added
with
a
glance
at
miss
mina
the
latter
wanted
to
follow
the
child
but
cornelli
called
back
i
can
do
it
myself
when
the
child
came
back
her
face
and
hands
were
washed
very
thoroughly
but
her
hair
looked
most
peculiar
she
had
combed
it
in
such
a
way
that
one
could
not
tell
what
belonged
to
the
left
and
what
to
the
right
side
what
to
the
front
and
what
to
the
back
the
cousin
laughed
and
said
your
head
looks
like
a
hay
field
miss
mina
will
part
your
hair
properly
for
you
cornelli
frowned
so
deeply
that
her
eyes
came
quite
close
together
she
did
not
look
up
any
more
from
her
plate
next
day
quite
early
the
director
departed
the
village
of
where
the
church
and
the
school
house
were
was
quite
a
distance
from
the
iron
works
cornelli
could
not
go
to
school
there
every
day
because
it
was
much
too
far
she
therefore
had
lessons
at
home
and
the
teacher
her
father
had
chosen
came
every
morning
and
taught
her
in
all
the
necessary
subjects
in
the
afternoon
she
was
free
except
for
the
work
which
she
had
to
do
for
the
following
day
that
took
little
time
and
till
now
the
child
had
really
had
a
very
free
existence
she
had
always
found
time
for
a
daily
visit
to
martha
and
a
long
conversation
with
her
old
friend
she
could
also
wander
freely
about
the
lovely
beech
wood
and
along
the
mountain
side
her
time
was
never
parcelled
out
for
her
there
were
many
wonderful
things
to
find
in
the
fields
and
woods
and
cornelli
never
tired
of
them
as
long
as
the
sun
was
shining
if
rain
or
snow
prevented
her
from
her
strolls
she
spent
her
afternoons
in
martha
cosy
chamber
there
she
had
the
most
pleasant
times
for
the
old
woman
conversation
and
tales
were
for
cornelli
a
never
ending
source
of
enjoyment
the
teacher
had
just
left
the
house
owing
to
her
father
departure
there
had
been
plenty
of
material
for
sentences
in
her
grammar
lesson
all
the
child
answers
to
his
questions
had
come
so
promptly
that
the
teacher
had
ended
his
lesson
on
the
stroke
of
the
hour
he
also
gave
cornelli
special
praise
for
the
excellent
work
she
had
done
then
he
heartily
shook
her
hand
the
two
were
the
best
of
friends
and
the
teacher
knew
his
pupil
well
whenever
she
was
very
bright
and
lively
he
would
work
very
hard
with
her
and
in
a
short
time
accomplish
three
times
more
than
usual
in
order
not
to
spoil
their
mutual
pleasure
he
would
let
her
off
most
punctually
but
whenever
cornelli
was
and
unwilling
to
work
he
progressed
slowly
and
carefully
treating
her
as
if
she
were
the
least
bit
weak
minded
he
would
keep
up
this
procedure
till
the
hand
of
the
clock
showed
a
quarter
a
half
or
even
of
an
hour
more
than
the
set
time
for
the
lessons
then
cornelli
had
hardly
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
time
before
lunch
to
run
over
to
the
garden
the
stable
and
the
hen
house
something
she
always
planned
to
do
the
teacher
would
finally
stop
and
say
in
his
most
friendly
manner
i
had
to
stay
so
long
because
we
did
not
do
half
of
what
we
should
have
done
you
were
a
little
slow
in
understanding
cornelli
i
hope
it
will
go
better
otherwise
your
lesson
might
last
still
longer
it
always
went
much
better
after
that
for
cornelli
had
no
inclination
whatever
to
have
such
a
tiresome
performance
repeated
after
such
a
lesson
many
days
went
by
before
she
was
lazy
again
cornelli
had
worked
quickly
and
well
for
she
wanted
to
have
lots
of
free
time
before
lunch
she
had
not
had
time
to
see
the
little
kid
since
yesterday
the
lesson
over
she
flew
to
the
stable
lunch
was
set
for
one
so
there
was
a
whole
hour
left
matthew
spied
the
approaching
child
and
called
to
her
come
here
cornelli
it
is
just
jumping
around
cornelli
ran
into
the
stable
where
she
saw
the
kid
hopping
merrily
over
to
its
mother
and
then
back
again
to
the
hay
it
looked
so
cunning
in
its
gambols
that
cornelli
went
into
perfect
raptures
oh
you
darling
little
thing
she
called
out
patting
its
spotless
fur
i
shall
fetch
a
red
ribbon
for
your
neck
and
then
we
take
a
walk
together
the
child
accordingly
ran
back
to
the
house
and
hunting
about
among
her
things
soon
returned
with
a
bright
red
ribbon
which
she
tied
about
the
little
kid
neck
cornelli
was
perfectly
delighted
for
she
had
never
in
her
life
seen
a
prettier
object
than
the
little
creature
with
its
fur
and
the
red
ribbon
round
its
neck
skipping
lightly
about
the
next
moment
it
lay
down
in
the
hay
and
looked
up
happily
at
cornelli
can
i
take
it
out
for
a
walk
matthew
can
i
harness
it
to
a
little
wagon
and
drive
around
with
it
asked
the
child
she
had
many
plans
in
her
head
one
following
on
top
of
the
other
wait
wait
we
have
to
let
it
grow
first
replied
matthew
thoughtfully
the
most
important
thing
for
it
is
to
grow
for
it
is
like
a
baby
that
has
just
learned
how
to
walk
it
has
to
stay
near
its
mother
and
can
only
run
about
near
her
when
it
is
bigger
it
can
take
walks
and
when
it
is
strong
and
big
we
can
harness
it
and
you
can
drive
it
about
with
two
reins
in
one
hand
and
a
long
whip
in
the
other
cornelli
shouted
with
joy
and
patted
the
kid
with
new
tenderness
she
already
pictured
to
herself
the
lovely
drives
that
they
would
have
together
did
you
hear
the
bell
in
the
foundry
i
am
sure
it
must
be
time
for
dinner
you
will
have
to
be
a
little
careful
now
cornelli
remember
that
strange
ladies
are
in
the
house
said
old
matthew
with
foresight
you
can
come
again
this
afternoon
cornelli
had
really
heard
nothing
for
she
had
been
absorbed
in
her
new
pet
she
knew
that
she
ought
to
appear
punctually
at
her
meals
so
she
left
right
away
she
had
also
noticed
that
the
ladies
were
not
buried
behind
big
newspapers
like
her
father
while
running
to
the
house
she
passed
a
hydrant
there
she
remembered
that
she
had
to
wash
her
hands
so
she
held
them
both
under
the
pipe
and
rubbed
them
hard
then
dipping
her
face
in
she
rubbed
it
too
she
had
nothing
to
dry
herself
with
except
a
very
small
handkerchief
hurry
up
the
ladies
are
already
at
table
she
heard
esther
voice
urging
her
from
the
kitchen
window
cornelli
ran
in
and
saw
both
ladies
already
seated
at
the
table
in
front
of
her
was
a
full
soup
plate
you
have
to
come
punctually
to
your
meals
i
am
sure
that
you
can
hear
the
loud
bell
out
in
the
garden
said
the
cousin
but
how
strange
you
look
half
wet
arms
a
soaking
apron
and
damp
feet
have
you
been
in
the
water
or
what
have
you
done
i
washed
my
hands
under
the
water
pump
and
i
got
splashed
cornelli
answered
naturally
remarked
miss
dorner
there
are
arrangements
in
the
rooms
for
washing
hands
which
involve
no
splashing
go
now
and
put
on
another
apron
you
have
to
be
orderly
and
neat
at
mealtimes
cornelli
departed
the
child
certainly
obeys
you
that
is
something
said
miss
grideelen
since
you
told
her
to
she
always
comes
to
table
properly
washed
that
is
true
but
she
has
the
most
manners
replied
miss
dorner
how
shall
one
get
rid
of
those
and
start
the
child
on
the
right
path
i
must
ask
you
to
help
her
in
the
morning
miss
mina
please
comb
her
hair
smoothly
and
part
it
the
way
i
told
you
to
i
did
it
miss
dorner
and
i
do
it
every
morning
she
answered
quite
hurt
cornelli
hair
is
just
like
bristles
and
it
is
very
hard
to
braid
when
she
jumps
it
all
gets
tangled
again
and
she
jumps
every
moment
cornelli
now
came
back
and
ate
her
soup
her
seat
was
beside
her
cousin
and
faced
the
other
lady
what
is
sticking
to
your
dress
here
asked
miss
dorner
looking
with
disgust
at
the
little
skirt
something
was
really
hanging
from
the
bottom
can
this
be
hay
or
straw
it
certainly
does
not
look
orderly
i
hope
you
have
not
come
from
the
stable
yes
i
have
replied
cornelli
how
horrid
indeed
i
can
even
smell
it
that
is
too
much
she
exclaimed
i
am
sure
your
father
would
not
let
you
go
there
if
he
knew
about
it
oh
certainly
he
goes
himself
cornelli
retorted
do
not
reply
impertinently
in
the
case
of
your
father
it
is
quite
different
explained
miss
dorner
i
want
to
tell
you
something
which
you
must
remember
if
you
are
allowed
to
go
to
the
stable
and
you
enjoy
doing
it
you
can
go
but
when
afterwards
you
come
to
your
meals
you
must
first
go
to
your
room
get
properly
washed
there
and
also
change
your
dress
be
sure
not
to
forget
yes
replied
cornelli
it
is
very
strange
what
queer
pleasures
country
children
have
remarked
miss
grideelen
have
you
no
books
cornelli
do
you
like
reading
better
than
wandering
around
and
going
to
the
stable
oh
no
i
do
like
it
better
but
i
have
some
books
replied
the
child
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
the
afternoon
when
you
have
no
more
lessons
to
study
asked
miss
dorner
i
always
go
to
martha
was
the
reply
who
is
martha
inquired
the
cousin
a
woman
said
cornelli
i
can
guess
that
replied
the
cousin
but
what
kind
of
a
woman
is
she
a
good
one
answered
cornelli
quickly
what
an
answer
the
cousin
turned
now
to
miss
mina
who
is
this
woman
can
the
child
go
to
see
her
does
anybody
here
know
about
her
she
questioned
oh
yes
she
is
well
known
here
and
was
here
long
before
i
came
was
mina
reply
she
nursed
the
mistress
of
this
house
in
her
last
illness
she
is
a
very
good
woman
and
always
looks
neat
and
clean
our
master
likes
her
well
now
i
have
really
found
out
something
you
must
learn
to
give
proper
answers
cornelli
do
you
hear
said
the
cousin
you
are
like
a
wild
hare
which
does
everything
in
leaps
and
bounds
you
can
go
to
see
the
woman
after
finishing
your
work
for
your
teacher
i
am
sure
you
must
have
some
to
do
for
cornelli
assented
to
this
and
as
soon
as
the
ladies
had
left
the
room
to
retire
to
their
bedrooms
for
the
hottest
hours
of
the
day
she
sat
down
at
her
little
table
in
the
corner
here
she
wrote
down
a
page
with
lightning
speed
then
taking
up
her
book
she
read
her
lesson
over
and
over
again
till
she
knew
it
by
heart
soon
she
was
finished
and
flinging
the
books
into
the
drawer
she
ran
out
of
the
house
oh
martha
i
wish
you
knew
how
terrible
it
is
at
home
now
since
papa
has
gone
called
cornelli
to
her
old
friend
before
she
had
even
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
i
just
wish
papa
was
back
already
and
everything
was
again
as
before
what
is
it
cornelli
what
makes
you
so
cross
come
sit
down
here
a
while
and
tell
me
about
it
said
martha
kindly
she
put
a
chair
beside
her
own
at
the
table
where
her
mending
lay
neatly
sorted
out
of
course
you
ca
understand
it
martha
cornelli
continued
just
as
excited
as
before
here
with
you
everything
is
always
the
same
and
nobody
comes
and
orders
everything
to
be
changed
now
i
am
not
allowed
to
come
in
any
more
without
getting
washed
now
i
can
not
come
out
of
the
stable
without
changing
my
clothes
then
i
must
not
wash
my
hands
at
the
hydrant
because
i
get
splashed
and
oh
so
many
new
things
have
to
be
done
so
different
from
before
i
am
sure
cornelli
that
it
is
not
at
all
bad
that
things
should
not
always
be
the
way
they
were
before
said
martha
reflectively
i
believe
that
the
lady
who
is
related
to
you
wants
the
same
thing
from
you
that
your
mother
would
have
wished
had
she
lived
this
is
very
good
for
you
of
course
miss
mina
and
esther
mean
well
but
your
relation
knows
much
better
what
is
to
be
done
to
make
you
grow
up
the
way
your
mother
would
have
desired
just
think
how
happy
your
father
would
be
if
you
should
resemble
your
mother
and
he
be
reminded
of
her
every
time
he
looked
at
you
you
well
know
what
great
joy
that
would
be
to
him
cornelli
did
know
that
her
father
would
be
very
happy
then
for
he
had
made
many
remarks
which
she
had
understood
a
short
time
ago
he
had
said
that
his
cousin
found
no
likeness
between
his
child
and
her
mother
and
cornelli
had
observed
the
sad
expression
of
his
eyes
when
he
had
said
it
cornelli
shook
her
head
you
said
once
that
my
mother
was
different
from
anybody
she
said
so
i
ca
ever
be
like
her
you
said
so
yourself
martha
yes
yes
i
have
said
that
confirmed
martha
but
i
have
to
explain
something
to
you
cornelli
if
you
ca
become
exactly
like
your
mother
you
certainly
can
become
more
like
her
than
anybody
else
for
you
are
her
child
and
a
child
always
has
something
from
her
mother
i
have
seen
you
look
at
me
just
the
way
she
did
with
the
same
brown
eyes
but
not
when
you
frown
the
way
you
do
you
must
try
to
watch
the
two
ladies
very
carefully
in
all
they
do
and
in
the
way
they
speak
they
are
your
mother
kind
and
that
is
why
i
am
so
glad
that
you
can
watch
their
manners
and
can
try
to
imitate
them
you
can
learn
to
resemble
your
mother
in
your
ways
if
you
copy
the
ladies
yes
i
shall
do
that
agreed
cornelli
just
the
same
i
am
not
terribly
pleased
that
they
are
here
and
that
everything
has
to
be
changed
oh
dear
i
have
just
remembered
that
i
have
to
be
back
now
and
drink
some
hot
coffee
and
milk
because
miss
dorner
says
that
the
afternoons
are
so
frightfully
long
in
the
country
they
have
to
be
interrupted
at
that
time
i
always
used
to
get
from
the
garden
some
apples
or
cherries
or
whatever
else
there
was
and
they
always
tasted
so
awfully
good
if
i
only
could
lengthen
my
afternoon
which
seems
too
long
to
them
i
never
can
do
all
i
plan
to
do
martha
and
with
these
words
cornelli
ran
away
chapter
iv
the
happens
esther
the
able
mistress
of
the
kitchen
was
standing
in
the
garden
picking
green
peas
which
hung
in
clusters
from
the
vines
they
had
ripened
quickly
in
the
sunny
june
weather
come
down
here
cornelli
she
called
just
see
how
many
peas
there
are
why
do
you
steal
about
so
quietly
nowadays
and
why
do
you
run
the
way
you
used
to
i
am
not
allowed
to
do
anything
any
more
replied
cornelli
approaching
her
mina
is
beginning
to
tell
me
that
i
even
must
not
jump
for
it
might
tangle
my
hair
i
wish
i
had
not
a
single
hair
left
then
i
could
at
least
run
and
jump
about
no
no
child
that
would
look
too
dreadful
just
imagine
it
but
do
get
sad
on
account
of
that
esther
consoled
her
just
jump
around
as
before
your
hair
can
always
be
put
in
order
again
why
have
you
come
into
the
kitchen
lately
to
see
if
things
taste
right
i
am
not
allowed
to
miss
dorner
says
that
is
bad
manners
cornelli
informed
her
oh
i
see
well
you
might
do
worse
things
however
you
must
obey
yes
you
have
to
obey
esther
repeated
do
you
go
to
miss
mina
any
more
either
when
she
fixes
the
dessert
cornelli
shook
her
head
miss
mina
had
quickly
understood
the
new
order
that
had
begun
in
the
household
and
accordingly
had
suited
herself
to
it
when
she
thought
the
ladies
would
not
approve
of
an
old
custom
she
dropped
it
quickly
and
cornelli
had
soon
noticed
her
change
of
attitude
i
do
care
if
i
never
can
go
to
the
pantry
any
more
i
do
care
cornelli
exploded
now
she
can
eat
all
the
things
herself
which
drop
beside
the
plate
i
do
care
i
do
want
anything
as
long
as
i
can
go
to
the
little
kid
in
the
stable
it
really
is
the
most
cunning
creature
in
the
whole
world
have
you
seen
it
yet
esther
certainly
i
have
and
why
not
the
cook
replied
matthew
took
me
out
to
the
stable
as
soon
as
it
was
born
you
can
certainly
go
to
see
it
as
long
as
it
is
in
our
own
stable
just
go
there
as
much
as
you
like
nobody
can
forbid
you
that
my
teacher
is
coming
cornelli
now
exclaimed
and
i
have
to
go
yes
child
but
do
keep
up
your
spirits
there
are
lots
of
pleasant
things
still
left
for
you
to
enjoy
just
wait
till
you
taste
the
strawberry
tarts
i
am
going
to
make
with
these
words
esther
smacked
her
lips
to
express
the
great
succulence
of
the
promised
dish
i
would
even
care
if
you
baked
nettle
tarts
i
wish
i
did
have
to
eat
at
table
and
could
just
eat
berries
in
the
garden
and
drink
milk
in
the
stable
cornelli
ran
towards
the
house
for
she
had
forgotten
to
walk
sedately
as
she
had
been
told
to
do
while
cornelli
had
her
lessons
upstairs
in
the
living
room
in
the
jessamine
arbor
both
ladies
were
sitting
on
a
garden
bench
it
would
be
so
pleasant
and
agreeable
here
said
miss
dorner
and
my
cousin
could
have
such
a
very
charming
life
if
the
child
were
only
a
little
different
do
you
think
betty
that
she
has
no
manners
whatever
yes
but
she
has
had
no
training
at
all
remarked
miss
grideelen
and
she
may
have
inherited
some
qualities
from
her
mother
oh
no
not
a
single
trait
you
can
not
possibly
imagine
a
greater
difference
than
between
the
mother
and
this
child
miss
dorner
exclaimed
cornelia
was
full
of
amiability
and
gayety
she
always
greeted
and
cheered
everyone
with
her
laughing
brown
eyes
if
my
cousin
could
only
have
the
happiness
to
see
his
child
resemble
her
mother
the
slightest
bit
he
was
so
fond
of
his
wife
he
deserves
this
joy
for
he
is
a
splendid
man
it
is
curious
how
very
different
children
can
be
from
their
parents
said
miss
grideelen
with
regret
in
her
voice
but
i
am
sure
that
something
can
still
be
accomplished
by
educating
the
child
many
qualities
can
be
developed
that
hardly
show
themselves
yet
we
ought
to
do
our
best
for
her
especially
for
her
father
sake
that
is
just
what
i
am
doing
betty
unfortunately
i
have
had
very
little
success
as
yet
answered
miss
dorner
but
i
just
hope
that
the
day
will
come
when
i
can
write
her
father
some
pleasant
news
about
cornelli
something
different
from
what
i
feel
obliged
to
send
him
now
the
day
had
been
exceedingly
hot
and
the
ladies
retired
to
their
rooms
immediately
after
dinner
while
cornelli
according
to
her
custom
obediently
did
her
lessons
then
she
disappeared
in
the
late
evening
when
the
ladies
sat
down
to
supper
it
was
so
warm
that
miss
mina
was
ordered
to
open
all
the
windows
now
cornelli
entered
for
mercy
sake
what
are
you
thinking
of
the
cousin
accosted
the
child
we
are
nearly
perishing
with
the
heat
and
you
put
on
a
fur
dress
which
you
could
wear
without
a
coat
in
a
sleigh
ride
in
the
middle
of
winter
why
do
you
do
such
foolish
things
cornelli
was
really
attired
very
strangely
her
little
dress
was
made
of
such
heavy
material
that
one
could
see
it
was
meant
for
the
coldest
winter
weather
and
for
someone
who
disliked
much
outer
clothing
the
child
cheeks
were
glowing
red
and
from
the
insufferable
heat
whole
streams
of
perspiration
trickled
down
her
face
i
have
no
more
dresses
left
she
said
stubbornly
can
you
understand
it
asked
the
cousin
looking
at
her
friend
i
really
think
that
this
is
the
fifth
dress
in
which
i
have
seen
cornelli
answered
the
friend
in
the
early
morning
i
saw
her
running
across
the
yard
in
a
dark
dress
at
breakfast
she
wore
a
light
frock
and
for
lunch
a
red
one
i
believe
that
she
wore
a
blue
dress
when
we
had
our
coffee
this
afternoon
so
this
must
be
the
fifth
costume
i
was
beginning
at
lunch
time
to
wonder
about
the
frequent
changes
i
have
to
change
my
dress
every
time
i
go
to
the
stable
cornelli
said
a
little
more
stubbornly
than
before
how
can
anybody
be
so
foolish
exclaimed
the
cousin
now
i
can
understand
now
why
you
have
no
fun
and
why
you
always
wear
an
unhappy
face
you
must
be
nearly
perished
with
the
heat
finish
your
supper
quickly
and
then
go
to
your
room
and
take
off
this
heavy
dress
you
surely
have
another
dress
i
must
forbid
you
to
go
to
the
stable
from
now
on
you
can
see
for
yourself
what
comes
of
it
if
only
you
would
not
frown
like
this
cornelli
you
look
exactly
as
if
you
had
two
little
horns
growing
on
your
forehead
one
on
each
side
there
are
many
other
and
better
amusements
for
you
than
spending
your
life
in
the
stable
are
you
able
to
embroider
no
cornelli
answered
curtly
children
of
your
age
ought
to
be
able
to
though
said
the
cousin
but
we
have
not
come
here
to
teach
you
that
have
we
betty
you
probably
do
not
even
know
how
to
hold
the
needle
in
your
hand
why
should
it
be
necessary
for
cornelli
to
learn
embroidery
just
now
replied
the
friend
she
has
lovely
books
that
she
can
read
she
has
shown
us
some
herself
do
you
prefer
reading
a
pretty
story
to
running
about
in
the
stable
child
no
i
do
replied
cornelli
crossly
we
must
not
pay
attention
to
what
she
says
remarked
miss
dorner
when
cornelli
is
bored
she
will
probably
turn
to
her
books
herself
please
miss
mina
keep
an
eye
on
cornelli
nonsense
like
this
must
not
happen
any
more
when
supper
was
finished
cornelli
went
up
to
her
room
and
miss
mina
followed
her
you
certainly
do
need
to
do
such
silly
things
she
said
scoldingly
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
stairs
where
her
words
could
not
be
overheard
i
have
enough
to
do
nowadays
without
watching
whether
you
put
on
a
new
dress
every
few
hours
it
is
my
fault
cornelli
replied
morosely
they
ordered
me
to
do
it
they
wo
always
smell
it
when
you
have
been
to
the
stable
scolded
miss
mina
yes
but
they
do
smell
it
cornelli
retorted
and
even
if
they
did
i
should
have
to
obey
they
told
me
to
change
every
time
i
go
to
the
stable
yes
but
now
you
are
told
not
to
go
there
any
more
remember
that
so
your
frequent
changing
will
have
to
stop
grumbled
miss
mina
while
she
was
helping
cornelli
to
take
off
her
hot
dress
now
i
have
to
clean
it
besides
you
actually
give
more
work
than
six
well
brought
up
children
miss
mina
had
never
before
spoken
so
roughly
to
cornelli
for
she
had
always
been
anxious
to
keep
in
the
good
graces
but
she
had
suddenly
ceased
to
care
about
that
cornelli
looked
at
her
with
astonishment
the
child
eyes
were
also
full
of
something
that
nobody
had
ever
seen
there
before
mina
seemed
to
understand
i
did
not
do
you
any
harm
she
said
quickly
what
i
have
said
is
only
the
truth
with
that
she
left
the
room
if
everybody
treats
me
that
way
i
be
that
way
too
cried
cornelli
with
a
furious
look
suddenly
taking
hold
of
the
dress
she
had
just
taken
off
she
threw
it
out
of
the
window
after
a
while
mina
returned
bringing
back
the
dress
cornelli
was
sitting
on
the
crossly
looking
down
at
the
yard
look
out
that
the
wind
does
blow
you
down
too
like
your
dress
miss
mina
said
unpleasantly
i
do
care
cornelli
replied
obstinately
it
did
not
blow
down
at
all
for
i
threw
it
down
on
purpose
oh
is
this
the
way
you
behave
next
time
you
can
get
it
yourself
said
miss
mina
running
away
indignantly
next
morning
cornelli
was
walking
across
the
courtyard
happily
talking
to
her
teacher
whose
hand
she
was
holding
during
her
school
hours
she
had
forgotten
all
the
troubles
of
the
day
before
for
malinger
had
been
as
kind
to
her
as
ever
he
at
least
had
not
changed
could
you
give
me
a
little
rose
he
asked
smilingly
while
they
were
passing
the
blooming
rose
bushes
so
cornelli
quickly
ran
from
bush
to
bush
till
she
had
gathered
a
fine
bunch
of
dark
and
light
white
and
red
roses
these
she
offered
to
her
teacher
warning
him
not
to
prick
himself
then
the
two
parted
most
cordially
cornelli
on
coming
back
ran
swiftly
toward
the
stable
suddenly
however
she
stood
stock
still
for
she
remembered
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
go
there
any
more
no
longer
could
she
see
the
darling
little
kid
and
watch
its
growth
she
would
be
unable
to
tell
when
the
moment
had
come
for
it
to
be
hitched
to
a
carriage
to
be
driven
about
by
her
she
might
not
be
allowed
even
to
do
that
she
hoped
however
that
her
father
might
be
back
by
that
time
and
that
then
everything
would
be
different
cornelli
danced
with
joy
at
that
thought
and
her
old
gaiety
seemed
to
return
she
felt
like
going
to
esther
and
talking
it
all
over
with
her
good
old
friend
the
moment
the
child
went
into
the
house
miss
dorner
stepped
out
of
the
living
room
you
have
just
come
in
time
she
said
for
i
have
to
show
you
something
where
are
you
going
to
the
kitchen
replied
cornelli
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
in
the
kitchen
and
you
shall
not
go
there
i
thought
you
knew
that
you
have
to
go
upstairs
before
lunch
to
fix
your
hair
but
before
you
go
up
come
in
here
i
have
to
tell
you
something
very
important
cornelli
followed
her
cousin
into
the
room
miss
grideelen
was
standing
near
the
window
as
if
she
had
expected
the
return
of
her
friend
leading
cornelli
to
the
sofa
miss
dorner
pointed
to
it
saying
you
are
sure
to
know
who
has
done
this
and
you
had
better
tell
me
right
away
on
the
dark
plush
coverings
were
visible
distinct
marks
of
dusty
shoe
soles
there
was
no
trace
of
a
whole
foot
but
one
could
see
that
somebody
had
trampled
on
the
sofa
i
did
not
do
it
said
cornelli
with
sparkling
eyes
who
in
all
the
house
would
have
done
it
except
you
please
ask
yourself
that
cornelli
there
is
no
question
about
it
at
all
said
miss
dorner
it
is
probably
one
of
your
little
jokes
similar
to
throwing
your
dresses
out
of
the
window
i
know
all
about
it
just
let
me
tell
you
this
it
is
the
last
time
that
you
a
girl
of
ten
years
old
will
show
such
a
terrible
lack
of
manners
as
long
as
i
am
here
you
shall
not
do
it
any
more
you
really
should
spare
your
good
sensitive
father
such
behavior
i
have
not
done
it
no
i
did
not
do
it
no
no
cornelli
cried
aloud
but
cornelli
only
reflect
you
are
blushing
and
your
conscience
is
giving
you
away
miss
grideelen
here
remarked
it
would
be
so
much
better
for
you
to
say
humbly
have
done
it
and
i
am
sorry
i
shall
never
do
it
again
no
no
i
have
not
done
it
no
no
cornelli
cried
out
louder
still
her
cheeks
were
glowing
red
from
anger
and
excitement
do
not
make
such
a
noise
ordered
the
cousin
one
might
think
there
was
an
accident
it
is
not
worth
while
to
lose
so
many
words
you
should
not
have
made
things
worse
by
denying
it
if
you
had
not
everything
would
be
all
settled
you
have
misbehaved
and
you
shall
not
do
so
any
more
remember
no
i
did
not
misbehave
no
no
and
i
shall
not
say
yes
when
it
is
not
true
cornelli
now
cried
quite
beside
herself
go
to
your
room
cornelli
and
smooth
out
your
forehead
before
you
come
to
dinner
your
little
horns
are
protruding
quite
plainly
when
you
act
that
way
just
look
at
yourself
in
the
mirror
and
see
yourself
how
repulsive
you
look
if
you
think
that
there
is
anybody
in
the
world
who
can
still
like
you
when
you
have
black
horns
on
your
forehead
you
are
mistaken
go
now
and
return
with
another
face
cornelli
went
reaching
her
room
cornelli
put
her
hand
up
to
her
brow
right
on
her
forehead
were
two
protruding
points
should
horns
be
really
growing
there
the
child
had
a
sudden
horrible
fright
at
this
thought
she
was
sure
that
everybody
could
see
them
already
for
she
could
feel
them
quite
distinctly
she
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
so
she
ran
away
to
old
martha
no
i
did
not
do
it
martha
i
never
did
it
she
called
out
running
into
the
little
room
when
i
tell
them
no
no
they
ought
to
believe
that
i
did
not
do
it
i
never
never
did
it
they
shall
know
it
but
they
wo
believe
me
even
if
i
say
it
a
hundred
times
and
stop
a
little
cornelli
said
old
martha
kindly
you
see
you
are
all
out
of
breath
sit
down
here
on
your
stool
and
tell
me
quietly
what
has
excited
you
so
you
know
that
i
believe
your
words
i
have
known
you
since
you
were
small
and
i
know
that
what
you
say
is
true
it
was
impossible
for
cornelli
to
speak
calmly
about
what
had
happened
but
it
soothed
her
nevertheless
to
be
able
to
pour
out
her
heart
and
to
know
that
martha
believed
her
she
told
of
the
accusation
which
had
been
brought
against
her
and
how
she
had
not
been
believed
despite
all
her
assurances
she
was
certain
that
both
ladies
would
always
believe
for
ever
and
ever
that
she
had
done
it
and
had
denied
it
at
this
thought
cornelli
again
became
quite
red
from
excitement
and
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
out
again
but
martha
put
her
hand
on
the
child
shoulder
quietly
restraining
her
no
no
cornelli
that
enough
she
said
soothingly
it
is
only
to
your
advantage
that
it
is
so
and
not
as
they
have
said
you
have
been
accused
wrongly
and
can
not
prove
it
but
god
knows
the
truth
he
has
heard
everything
you
can
be
calm
and
happy
and
look
up
to
him
with
a
clear
conscience
you
can
say
to
yourself
knows
it
and
i
do
not
need
to
be
afraid
or
frightened
if
you
had
really
done
wrong
and
had
denied
it
you
would
have
to
be
afraid
that
the
truth
would
be
revealed
then
you
could
not
look
up
calmly
to
the
sky
for
you
would
be
frightened
at
the
thought
that
up
there
was
one
who
knew
everything
and
from
whom
nothing
could
be
hidden
a
wrong
accusation
does
not
stay
with
us
forever
even
if
it
takes
ever
so
long
it
generally
is
revealed
in
the
end
and
you
certainly
will
not
need
to
bear
it
in
all
eternity
because
god
already
knows
how
it
is
cornelli
had
really
grown
calm
at
the
thought
that
there
was
one
who
knew
how
it
all
was
when
her
trouble
began
to
weigh
upon
her
she
could
always
say
you
know
it
all
dear
father
in
heaven
you
have
seen
and
heard
everything
if
he
could
only
tell
them
they
would
then
know
it
too
god
could
easily
do
that
cornelli
said
yes
but
that
is
not
the
way
things
happen
we
do
not
know
better
than
he
what
is
good
for
us
martha
said
shaking
her
head
quite
seriously
if
we
could
rule
everything
would
come
wrong
we
never
can
see
ahead
of
the
hour
and
we
never
know
what
is
good
for
us
because
the
next
moment
always
brings
something
we
did
not
know
about
otherwise
we
would
always
be
trying
to
undo
what
we
have
strained
to
do
the
day
before
we
should
only
make
ourselves
miserable
over
and
over
again
but
if
god
ordains
anything
that
we
do
not
understand
we
must
believe
firmly
that
something
good
will
come
out
of
it
we
must
be
patient
and
if
our
troubles
are
too
heavy
we
must
console
ourselves
and
think
god
knows
what
good
will
come
from
it
but
we
are
forgetting
the
time
cornelli
you
must
hurry
home
to
your
dinner
now
i
am
afraid
it
is
already
late
cornelli
black
frown
had
disappeared
during
martha
soothing
speech
but
now
a
deep
shadow
flew
across
her
face
oh
martha
if
i
only
did
not
need
to
go
home
any
more
i
hate
to
go
back
and
sit
at
table
i
would
not
mind
dying
of
hunger
if
i
could
only
stay
here
with
you
cornelli
glancing
at
her
home
drew
together
her
brows
as
if
she
saw
something
frightful
there
but
child
you
must
not
say
such
things
about
your
lovely
home
it
is
wrong
to
do
that
said
martha
kindly
admonishing
her
just
think
how
many
children
have
no
home
at
all
how
grateful
they
would
be
to
god
for
a
home
like
yours
go
now
cornelli
be
grateful
for
all
god
has
given
you
and
chase
away
the
thoughts
that
make
you
sad
come
soon
again
and
we
shall
be
glad
together
for
there
is
always
something
to
be
glad
about
cornelli
went
while
she
had
been
with
martha
and
had
heard
her
words
it
had
really
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
no
cause
for
grief
as
soon
however
as
she
entered
the
garden
and
saw
the
windows
of
the
room
where
they
were
surely
already
at
table
everything
that
had
pressed
heavily
on
her
heart
rose
again
after
all
martha
did
not
know
everything
cornelli
was
sure
that
she
could
never
be
happy
any
more
she
could
not
go
in
there
and
she
could
not
eat
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
swallow
anything
for
big
stones
seemed
to
stick
in
her
throat
if
she
would
only
die
from
it
all
cornelli
thought
that
that
would
be
best
for
then
everything
would
be
over
so
she
sat
down
on
the
lawn
behind
the
thick
currant
bushes
where
she
could
not
be
seen
from
the
house
meanwhile
miss
mina
had
carried
away
the
sweets
and
was
putting
the
fruit
course
on
the
table
it
seems
to
me
that
cornelli
does
not
care
if
she
comes
to
table
a
whole
hour
late
said
miss
dorner
nothing
is
to
be
kept
warm
for
her
for
she
does
not
seem
to
have
learned
yet
how
to
respect
time
and
order
she
had
better
learn
it
soon
mina
went
out
to
sit
down
for
her
dinner
esther
had
everything
ready
and
was
just
putting
the
dessert
in
the
cupboard
that
is
for
cornelli
as
soon
as
she
comes
home
she
said
sitting
down
too
the
poor
child
gets
enough
bitter
things
to
swallow
nowadays
but
why
should
she
come
in
time
asked
mina
crossly
besides
she
could
possibly
eat
the
whole
dessert
we
can
take
our
share
and
there
will
be
enough
left
surely
as
much
as
is
good
for
her
i
wo
let
you
have
it
said
esther
firmly
pressing
her
arm
to
the
table
as
a
sign
that
she
would
stay
there
the
child
must
have
something
that
will
help
her
to
swallow
all
the
cross
words
she
hears
all
day
she
continued
what
was
wrong
again
this
morning
when
there
was
such
a
scene
in
the
living
room
it
was
nothing
replied
mina
there
were
a
few
marks
of
dust
on
the
sofa
and
the
ladies
thought
that
cornelli
had
been
standing
on
it
the
child
would
not
admit
it
and
so
the
ladies
kept
on
accusing
her
till
cornelli
set
up
a
senseless
row
i
really
think
miss
mina
that
you
could
have
given
an
explanation
said
esther
with
a
sly
smile
if
one
has
to
wind
up
the
clock
it
is
quicker
to
jump
up
on
the
sofa
than
to
push
the
heavy
thing
away
when
one
wears
tight
lace
boots
in
the
early
morning
one
ca
take
them
off
easily
eh
miss
mina
with
these
words
esther
glanced
at
the
neat
little
boots
that
mina
was
stretching
out
comfortably
under
the
table
well
what
was
there
so
terrible
about
that
retorted
mina
pertly
the
sofa
wo
be
spoiled
on
account
of
that
and
besides
i
have
to
clean
it
myself
i
only
think
you
could
have
said
a
word
before
the
ladies
accused
the
child
of
having
lied
to
them
and
before
she
nearly
had
a
fit
over
the
injustice
she
made
such
a
noise
that
one
could
hear
it
all
over
the
house
it
went
right
through
me
oh
pooh
it
was
not
as
bad
as
that
asserted
mina
the
child
has
long
since
forgotten
the
whole
thing
that
is
the
way
with
children
one
moment
they
make
a
horrible
noise
and
the
next
they
go
out
of
the
door
and
forget
about
it
why
should
one
bother
it
used
to
be
different
said
esther
smilingly
miss
mina
could
not
be
obliging
enough
to
the
child
then
things
are
all
done
for
other
people
now
and
not
for
those
of
the
house
those
of
the
house
repeated
mina
mockingly
it
wo
be
long
before
you
too
will
be
singing
another
tune
when
the
new
lady
of
the
house
gives
orders
in
the
kitchen
you
will
have
to
obey
too
esther
dropped
her
spoon
for
goodness
sake
what
are
you
saying
she
exclaimed
who
should
have
thought
of
such
a
thing
whom
do
you
mean
the
cousin
or
the
other
one
well
i
ca
tell
that
exactly
replied
the
maid
our
master
has
not
discussed
that
with
me
but
one
must
be
dumb
not
to
see
what
is
going
on
and
why
the
ladies
came
here
after
all
one
wants
to
know
what
one
is
going
to
do
that
two
have
come
is
the
surest
sign
of
all
for
we
shall
be
supposed
not
to
suspect
for
goodness
sake
said
esther
again
what
a
discovery
i
am
sure
it
must
be
the
relation
for
she
already
rules
the
house
i
tell
you
one
thing
though
miss
mina
that
i
shall
keep
on
singing
the
same
tune
i
have
been
singing
for
the
last
twelve
years
in
this
house
and
i
do
care
who
is
going
to
rule
you
can
believe
me
oh
we
shall
see
about
that
esther
said
mina
with
a
superior
air
she
got
up
now
to
see
if
the
ladies
needed
anything
waking
up
from
a
sound
sleep
cornelli
did
not
remember
where
she
was
she
was
lying
on
the
lawn
behind
the
currant
bushes
she
remembered
at
last
how
she
had
come
back
at
lunch
time
from
martha
cottage
and
how
she
had
suddenly
felt
weary
and
sleepy
she
must
have
dropped
down
and
gone
to
sleep
it
was
evening
and
there
was
no
more
sunshine
on
the
grass
but
the
sky
was
still
light
although
it
was
beginning
to
grow
dark
cornelli
suddenly
had
a
longing
she
had
never
known
before
she
felt
as
if
she
had
to
eat
and
taste
everything
about
her
the
bushes
and
the
leaves
the
flowers
and
especially
the
unripe
plums
on
the
tree
above
her
oh
if
she
only
had
a
piece
of
bread
cornelli
got
up
quickly
and
ran
towards
the
house
come
quickly
cornelli
esther
called
to
her
through
the
open
kitchen
window
they
are
just
sitting
down
to
supper
you
have
come
just
in
time
cornelli
flew
to
her
room
and
pulling
out
a
thick
shawl
from
among
her
things
tied
it
around
her
head
then
running
to
the
dining
room
she
sat
down
at
her
accustomed
seat
so
you
have
come
again
said
miss
dorner
who
had
just
settled
down
too
a
well
brought
up
child
should
at
least
say
good
evening
when
she
enters
the
room
after
a
long
absence
good
evening
said
cornelli
after
which
she
finished
her
soup
with
unusual
haste
where
do
you
come
from
after
all
this
time
asked
the
cousin
from
the
garden
was
the
reply
that
is
quite
possible
but
where
were
you
before
that
with
martha
cornelli
answered
if
you
could
only
learn
to
answer
more
pleasantly
remarked
miss
dorner
it
would
be
to
your
own
advantage
for
you
do
not
have
many
pleasing
things
about
you
it
would
only
make
you
more
attractive
and
you
really
should
strive
to
become
so
next
time
you
want
to
stay
so
long
at
this
woman
house
you
have
to
ask
my
permission
i
absolutely
forbid
you
to
stay
away
so
long
without
asking
me
do
you
hear
you
deserve
to
be
scolded
for
your
long
absence
but
i
shall
not
say
anything
further
but
why
do
you
look
so
pitiful
what
is
the
matter
have
you
a
toothache
no
cornelli
quickly
gave
forth
have
you
a
headache
no
what
is
the
matter
with
you
nothing
you
shall
never
again
set
up
such
a
masquerade
when
there
is
nothing
the
matter
with
you
cornelli
said
the
cousin
scoldingly
why
do
you
put
this
shawl
around
your
head
are
you
trying
to
look
like
an
untidy
gypsy
do
ever
come
to
table
that
way
again
betty
have
you
ever
seen
the
like
can
you
understand
this
behavior
from
a
sensible
child
the
friend
just
shook
her
head
perhaps
cornelli
does
it
because
she
does
not
know
what
else
to
do
she
does
not
seem
to
desire
a
proper
occupation
she
replied
when
cornelli
came
down
to
breakfast
next
day
she
had
taken
off
the
shawl
but
she
still
looked
very
odd
you
look
exactly
like
a
savage
from
new
zealand
said
the
cousin
do
you
think
you
are
improving
your
appearance
by
plastering
your
hair
all
over
your
face
no
said
cornelli
fiercely
neither
do
i
said
the
cousin
i
can
not
make
you
out
at
all
what
will
you
put
on
next
i
wonder
when
your
hair
is
brushed
away
my
fur
cap
replied
cornell
according
to
the
truth
i
never
heard
such
nonsense
exclaimed
miss
dorner
i
really
think
that
the
child
is
capable
of
doing
that
she
will
probably
pull
it
down
over
her
head
to
her
nose
when
the
temperature
is
eighty
i
have
never
seen
such
a
child
what
shall
i
do
with
her
cornelli
really
looked
as
if
she
did
not
know
how
well
brought
up
european
girls
usually
wore
their
hair
from
the
middle
of
her
head
thick
uneven
strands
of
dark
hair
hung
down
over
her
forehead
and
deep
into
her
eyes
the
hair
was
not
hanging
loose
but
was
firmly
glued
to
her
skin
her
intention
seemed
to
be
to
keep
it
there
to
prevent
it
from
being
blown
away
you
look
positively
repulsive
and
no
person
on
earth
will
want
to
look
at
you
if
you
go
around
like
that
this
may
teach
you
to
give
up
your
terrible
obstinacy
nothing
else
can
be
done
with
you
with
these
words
the
cousin
rose
and
left
the
room
miss
grideelen
promptly
followed
that
evening
a
letter
was
sent
to
cornelli
father
july
my
dear
cousin
your
affairs
are
going
brilliantly
for
your
manager
is
splendid
i
can
also
inform
you
that
perfect
order
reigns
in
your
house
your
garden
and
the
stable
your
place
is
perfectly
magnificent
it
abounds
in
fruit
and
vegetables
and
lovely
flowers
i
should
never
have
imagined
this
possible
years
ago
when
i
wandered
about
here
with
my
friend
cornelia
i
am
coming
now
to
the
principal
subject
of
this
letter
which
is
less
pleasant
i
do
not
understand
how
your
daughter
has
gotten
her
disposition
she
does
not
either
resemble
you
with
your
fresh
and
open
manner
or
cornelia
with
her
merry
pliant
disposition
which
won
every
one
heart
the
child
has
a
dull
and
sullen
nature
a
roughness
of
manner
and
an
stubbornness
i
can
do
nothing
for
her
at
least
not
by
anything
i
say
but
i
have
decided
to
leave
physical
or
other
punishment
to
you
i
shall
do
all
i
can
by
good
example
and
admonishment
as
long
as
i
am
here
my
friend
is
supporting
me
faithfully
i
do
not
dare
raise
in
you
the
hope
that
the
child
will
ever
make
you
happy
a
rebellious
nature
like
hers
is
sure
to
get
worse
from
year
to
year
i
hope
however
that
the
success
of
all
your
ventures
will
give
you
the
satisfaction
that
your
home
life
can
not
give
you
your
faithful
cousin
kitty
dorner
chapter
v
a
newcomer
in
old
matthew
was
raking
the
gravel
paths
in
the
garden
when
cornelli
stepped
out
of
the
house
and
slowly
approached
she
held
a
book
in
her
hand
and
now
sat
down
on
the
bench
under
the
hazel
bush
laying
the
book
on
her
lap
she
watched
matthew
while
he
cleaned
up
the
paths
looking
up
he
said
come
with
me
cornelli
and
let
us
go
over
to
the
stable
together
for
you
have
not
been
there
for
a
long
time
you
should
see
how
the
little
kid
is
growing
cornelli
merely
shook
her
head
and
gave
no
answer
matthew
looked
over
at
the
child
a
few
more
times
but
said
no
more
esther
carrying
a
large
basket
now
arrived
as
she
was
going
to
the
vegetable
garden
she
called
over
to
the
child
you
must
have
a
specially
nice
book
to
be
sitting
there
so
quietly
cornelli
cornelli
shook
her
head
no
laughed
esther
all
right
then
come
with
me
and
i
show
you
how
many
yellow
plums
there
are
going
to
be
this
year
the
whole
tree
is
full
and
they
are
already
beginning
to
ripen
i
do
care
said
cornelli
no
laughed
esther
all
right
then
plums
esther
exclaimed
and
our
large
juicy
pears
are
beginning
to
get
ripe
too
do
you
want
to
come
and
see
how
long
it
will
be
before
they
are
ripe
no
was
the
reply
esther
now
went
her
ways
a
short
time
after
that
matthew
joined
her
what
is
the
matter
with
the
child
esther
he
asked
she
is
so
changed
one
can
hardly
recognize
any
more
our
gay
and
friendly
cornelli
and
why
does
she
have
her
hair
hanging
into
her
face
that
way
one
absolutely
does
not
know
her
any
more
that
is
just
what
i
say
esther
replied
i
really
ca
understand
it
one
hardly
ever
sees
the
child
and
if
one
does
meet
her
somewhere
she
scarcely
says
a
word
she
never
sings
or
laughs
the
way
she
used
to
and
she
always
wears
such
a
terribly
unhappy
expression
that
it
fairly
makes
one
heart
ache
how
happy
the
child
used
to
be
they
say
that
she
needs
to
be
educated
and
it
may
be
so
but
since
she
is
getting
an
education
she
is
absolutely
changed
and
not
for
the
better
however
things
may
go
well
again
when
her
education
is
finished
she
misses
her
mother
said
matthew
it
is
awfully
hard
on
a
little
one
to
grow
up
without
a
mother
for
she
needs
her
at
every
step
it
is
so
easy
when
you
have
a
mother
to
whom
you
can
tell
your
joys
and
troubles
one
might
think
that
you
still
run
to
your
mother
whenever
anyone
does
you
harm
matthew
said
esther
a
little
mockingly
i
should
love
to
matthew
assured
her
i
know
what
my
mother
meant
to
me
and
so
i
am
always
sorry
for
every
child
that
has
none
one
can
see
how
it
is
with
our
master
child
nothing
is
of
any
good
to
her
as
long
as
she
has
no
mother
matthew
went
away
looking
once
more
with
pity
at
cornelli
who
was
sitting
quite
motionless
on
the
bench
the
book
by
now
was
lying
on
the
ground
soon
afterwards
maelinger
entered
the
garden
and
neared
the
house
but
cornelli
intercepted
him
i
could
not
come
at
he
said
but
i
think
one
hour
is
better
than
none
so
am
here
now
at
i
hope
you
have
spent
a
pleasant
useful
morning
no
i
have
said
cornelli
drily
but
you
have
a
fine
book
in
your
hand
it
is
sure
to
have
something
nice
in
it
what
is
it
all
about
i
do
not
know
replied
cornelli
let
us
go
to
our
work
now
your
reading
does
not
seem
to
have
impressed
you
much
so
let
us
hope
for
a
better
result
from
our
lesson
the
teacher
entered
the
house
with
his
pupil
and
they
were
just
getting
settled
in
their
accustomed
places
when
he
said
it
seems
to
me
cornelli
that
your
hair
hangs
a
little
too
much
over
your
face
it
must
be
very
uncomfortable
could
not
this
be
changed
no
i
can
never
change
that
never
never
cornelli
said
passionately
tightly
pressing
down
the
hair
on
her
forehead
oh
really
but
this
is
no
affair
of
mine
said
the
teacher
calmly
only
it
seems
to
me
a
rather
disfiguring
manner
of
wearing
the
hair
you
would
feel
much
more
comfortable
without
these
hangings
in
front
of
your
eyes
cornelli
was
still
pressing
both
her
hands
against
her
forehead
as
if
the
teacher
might
try
by
force
to
straighten
up
her
hair
but
he
now
began
the
lesson
quite
peacefully
when
the
ladies
were
leaving
the
room
after
lunch
the
cousin
said
to
the
child
you
are
not
going
to
run
off
again
immediately
cornelli
you
must
begin
a
proper
and
orderly
existence
when
your
work
is
done
you
can
read
one
of
your
many
lovely
books
you
have
enough
time
after
our
coffee
hour
to
take
walks
and
to
pay
visits
as
usual
the
work
was
soon
finished
afterwards
cornelli
sat
down
on
the
garden
bench
just
as
before
she
put
the
book
in
her
lap
and
it
soon
fell
to
the
ground
cornelli
peeped
about
her
at
the
trees
and
at
the
ground
but
she
did
not
really
seem
to
see
them
at
coffee
time
cornelli
punctually
appeared
at
table
and
quickly
gulped
down
everything
that
was
poured
out
for
her
as
if
it
were
a
medicine
that
simply
had
to
be
swallowed
afterwards
she
sat
there
frowning
for
she
had
to
remain
at
her
seat
till
the
ladies
got
up
she
had
learned
this
custom
from
her
cousin
do
always
frown
and
make
such
horns
one
can
see
them
quite
plainly
even
through
your
curtains
said
miss
dorner
it
wo
be
long
before
you
can
go
away
at
last
the
ladies
got
up
to
go
into
the
garden
cornelli
sneaked
out
behind
them
turned
unseen
around
the
corner
of
the
house
and
walked
across
the
meadow
to
the
path
to
sit
here
under
the
hazel
bush
and
read
a
fine
book
is
really
a
pleasure
not
many
children
have
said
miss
dorner
sitting
down
on
the
bench
for
this
alone
you
should
be
grateful
instead
of
frowning
and
sulking
all
day
cornelli
yes
but
where
has
she
gone
again
the
lady
interrupted
herself
glancing
around
she
disappeared
as
soon
as
we
came
out
her
friend
answered
cornelli
really
peculiar
she
never
says
a
friendly
word
and
never
gives
a
single
sign
of
childish
love
she
always
runs
away
as
soon
as
she
possibly
can
i
am
so
sorry
for
her
father
who
must
long
for
a
pleasant
family
life
miss
dorner
continued
he
will
never
have
this
by
the
side
of
his
only
daughter
who
seems
to
become
more
unfriendly
and
stubborn
every
day
others
in
the
house
have
noticed
it
too
so
mina
tells
me
oh
what
a
life
it
will
be
here
in
two
or
three
years
my
poor
cousin
with
his
beautiful
estate
what
good
is
that
to
him
many
things
can
happen
in
two
years
that
ca
be
foretold
kitty
and
that
can
change
a
household
entirely
replied
the
other
lady
for
the
benefit
of
your
cousin
let
us
hope
that
this
may
come
true
cornelli
was
not
leaping
or
running
but
was
quietly
creeping
along
the
edge
of
the
path
she
was
staring
at
the
ground
without
once
looking
up
at
the
merry
birds
which
were
whistling
above
her
not
once
did
she
glance
to
right
or
left
in
the
meadows
though
they
were
full
of
red
daisies
and
blue
which
cornelli
ordinarily
loved
to
pick
martha
saw
the
approaching
child
she
came
out
with
a
worried
face
and
full
of
sympathy
asked
what
is
wrong
with
you
cornelli
can
you
never
again
be
merry
no
not
any
more
replied
cornelli
entering
martha
little
chamber
and
sitting
down
on
the
stool
which
her
old
friend
had
put
for
her
in
the
usual
place
cornelli
words
did
not
come
rapidly
and
angrily
any
more
as
they
had
done
before
with
a
deep
sigh
she
added
i
only
wish
i
had
never
learned
to
read
what
but
child
what
an
idea
exclaimed
martha
what
a
foolish
wish
you
should
realize
what
it
means
to
want
to
find
out
something
and
not
be
able
to
one
has
to
begin
over
and
over
again
and
nothing
helps
one
that
is
what
happened
to
me
if
you
do
help
me
i
wo
ever
understand
it
i
often
wish
i
could
read
and
write
as
fast
as
our
cornelli
does
it
is
a
great
gift
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
easily
and
everybody
who
ca
do
it
knows
that
well
do
you
like
the
pretty
books
your
father
has
given
you
no
i
do
they
are
pretty
but
awfully
tiresome
martha
cornelli
assured
her
there
are
all
kinds
of
stories
and
descriptions
in
them
of
famous
people
and
discoveries
father
said
that
he
used
to
love
them
when
he
was
young
but
he
was
probably
different
from
me
now
i
ca
run
to
the
stable
any
more
nor
into
the
woods
as
i
feel
like
doing
now
i
have
to
sit
around
all
the
time
and
read
a
book
oh
i
wish
nobody
had
written
any
books
then
nobody
would
have
to
read
them
but
cornelli
i
do
not
think
that
this
would
suit
everybody
martha
said
please
help
me
to
read
a
letter
i
got
and
then
you
will
see
what
an
advantage
it
is
to
be
able
to
read
i
need
your
help
for
i
do
not
understand
what
is
wanted
of
me
cornelli
taking
up
the
letter
was
quite
willing
to
help
her
dear
old
friend
who
wrote
it
asked
the
child
that
is
just
the
thing
i
can
not
read
martha
answered
i
only
know
that
it
comes
from
town
but
i
can
not
guess
who
could
possibly
write
to
me
from
there
cornelli
began
to
read
the
letter
aloud
it
was
an
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
spare
room
had
yet
been
taken
and
if
wolf
could
take
care
of
a
boy
of
twelve
years
for
a
few
weeks
he
did
not
need
special
care
as
he
was
not
exactly
ill
but
the
boy
undoubtedly
was
not
very
strong
good
air
and
fresh
milk
were
the
chief
things
he
needed
if
no
refusal
came
the
boy
would
arrive
in
the
middle
of
july
it
was
signed
nika
halm
rector
widow
oh
how
easily
you
read
it
seems
to
go
all
of
itself
said
martha
admiringly
when
cornelli
had
finished
i
never
could
have
made
it
out
so
well
just
think
how
proud
i
can
be
that
a
rector
wife
will
bring
her
son
to
me
oh
i
take
the
best
care
of
him
and
i
must
ask
matthew
to
let
him
have
some
milk
from
the
cows
every
morning
and
evening
is
it
too
bad
it
is
not
a
girl
then
you
would
have
a
playmate
but
you
will
entertain
each
other
just
the
same
are
you
not
a
little
bit
glad
that
he
is
coming
no
not
a
bit
cornelli
returned
curtly
i
know
quite
well
that
he
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
me
and
i
know
why
too
i
do
not
care
whether
it
is
a
boy
or
a
girl
i
do
want
him
but
cornelli
you
never
used
to
be
that
way
you
used
to
be
so
friendly
and
bright
with
everybody
what
has
happened
to
you
asked
martha
quite
grieved
you
do
not
look
about
you
with
bright
eyes
and
your
hair
hangs
too
low
on
your
face
ca
i
push
it
back
a
little
martha
fetching
a
comb
was
going
to
touch
cornelli
hair
when
cornelli
hindered
her
by
crying
out
no
martha
leave
it
it
has
to
stay
that
way
all
my
life
oh
no
i
wo
believe
that
why
should
your
face
be
half
covered
up
one
can
hardly
recognize
you
martha
said
regretfully
what
do
the
ladies
say
about
it
miss
dorner
says
that
i
am
the
most
obstinate
being
in
the
whole
world
and
that
no
one
can
ever
set
me
right
was
cornelli
truthful
information
then
she
added
she
says
that
no
child
on
earth
looks
as
ugly
as
i
do
and
that
nobody
in
the
world
will
ever
like
me
i
know
that
it
is
true
and
i
only
wish
nobody
were
coming
to
you
then
i
could
always
be
alone
with
you
cornelli
i
am
quite
sure
that
you
would
do
right
in
obeying
the
ladies
said
martha
if
you
did
what
they
say
they
would
love
you
as
well
as
everybody
else
does
no
no
martha
you
do
know
how
it
is
cornelli
said
quite
frightened
i
do
everything
they
say
but
i
can
never
push
my
hair
away
for
then
it
would
be
worse
still
and
everybody
could
see
it
martha
shook
her
head
i
do
not
know
what
you
mean
cornelli
please
come
to
me
just
as
often
as
you
can
i
shall
always
love
you
more
than
anybody
who
might
ever
come
here
if
you
did
not
come
it
would
hurt
me
dreadfully
then
i
would
rather
not
have
the
rector
son
here
glad
as
i
am
now
that
he
is
coming
all
right
martha
then
i
shall
come
cornelli
promised
we
can
easily
be
alone
together
in
the
kitchen
for
i
want
to
see
you
alone
i
shall
not
come
on
monday
for
that
is
the
day
they
arrive
on
tuesday
though
i
come
then
we
go
together
to
the
kitchen
martha
promised
this
and
cornelli
went
home
in
the
same
way
as
she
had
come
not
once
did
she
run
to
the
meadow
to
pick
or
other
flowers
that
were
sparkling
there
when
monday
came
she
was
wondering
if
a
carriage
would
arrive
with
a
proud
city
boy
and
a
lady
with
a
high
feather
hat
both
of
whom
would
look
down
on
her
with
disdain
cornelli
settled
down
beside
the
garden
fence
for
from
there
she
could
conveniently
survey
the
road
but
she
saw
no
carriage
though
she
watched
through
both
the
morning
and
the
afternoon
she
really
was
very
glad
for
she
was
quite
sure
that
nobody
had
arrived
next
day
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
be
free
she
walked
over
to
martha
little
house
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
nobody
has
come
now
i
can
be
alone
with
you
and
do
have
to
go
to
the
kitchen
cornelli
had
said
these
words
on
entering
but
she
suddenly
stopped
a
boy
she
had
never
seen
sat
at
the
table
in
the
room
and
martha
was
just
clearing
away
the
supper
things
so
he
had
come
after
all
and
had
even
heard
what
she
had
said
oh
it
was
dreadful
but
the
boy
was
laughing
cornelli
wanted
to
withdraw
quickly
but
the
boy
called
out
please
come
in
and
let
us
get
acquainted
martha
has
already
told
me
about
you
just
come
in
he
continued
when
he
saw
that
cornelli
still
hesitated
if
you
want
to
be
alone
with
wolf
i
can
easily
go
to
my
own
room
cornelli
felt
that
it
was
very
nice
of
the
boy
not
to
resent
her
words
and
to
be
willing
to
give
place
to
her
she
therefore
entered
martha
had
already
put
a
chair
in
readiness
for
her
and
greeted
her
heartily
i
expected
you
cornelli
she
said
just
sit
down
here
a
little
with
our
guest
his
name
is
dino
halm
and
he
already
knows
your
name
i
am
sure
you
will
have
a
good
time
together
i
go
up
in
the
meantime
and
if
you
need
me
you
can
find
me
in
the
room
upstairs
martha
thinking
that
the
children
could
get
acquainted
better
if
they
were
left
alone
had
planned
to
unpack
her
new
arrival
things
while
they
were
together
she
put
his
belongings
neatly
away
in
the
wardrobe
and
the
drawers
in
order
to
make
him
feel
at
home
in
his
tidy
little
chamber
why
did
you
think
that
we
did
not
come
asked
dino
as
soon
as
martha
had
left
the
room
and
cornelli
was
sitting
beside
him
silently
because
i
did
not
see
the
carriage
she
replied
the
carriage
well
i
can
believe
you
said
dino
we
walked
more
than
an
hour
in
fact
nearly
two
before
we
got
here
from
the
station
do
you
just
hop
into
a
carriage
when
you
go
to
the
station
yes
i
do
i
always
go
there
with
papa
replied
cornelli
but
where
do
the
horses
always
come
from
dino
wanted
to
know
from
our
stable
was
the
answer
have
you
your
own
carriage
and
two
horses
of
your
own
just
to
be
able
to
drive
about
dino
questioned
full
of
astonishment
yes
we
have
the
two
brown
ones
and
six
others
to
carry
away
the
iron
from
the
foundry
good
gracious
eight
horses
dino
exclaimed
you
are
lucky
to
be
able
to
sit
in
a
carriage
with
your
father
and
drive
around
ca
you
do
that
asked
cornelli
never
in
my
life
dino
replied
in
a
voice
full
of
conviction
first
of
all
i
do
not
have
a
father
besides
that
we
do
not
own
a
stable
and
horses
how
lucky
you
are
have
you
anything
else
in
the
stable
oh
yes
lots
more
six
cows
and
a
large
gray
stable
cat
cornelli
informed
him
then
there
is
an
old
nanny
goat
and
a
young
snow
white
kid
about
whose
neck
i
tied
a
red
ribbon
you
are
going
to
drink
milk
from
our
cow
did
you
know
that
oh
i
shall
love
to
do
that
dino
exclaimed
do
you
think
i
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
stable
and
look
at
the
horses
certainly
you
will
matthew
will
love
to
show
them
to
you
and
martha
will
willingly
let
you
go
if
i
only
could
go
with
you
and
cornelli
uttered
a
deep
sigh
well
i
should
think
you
certainly
could
do
that
when
the
stable
belongs
to
you
who
would
hinder
you
i
like
to
know
dino
said
do
you
know
what
we
do
we
hitch
the
little
kid
to
a
cart
that
be
lovely
it
can
pull
you
and
i
shall
be
the
coachman
i
once
saw
such
a
little
carriage
on
a
promenade
in
town
cornelli
had
already
had
that
thought
herself
but
she
knew
now
that
she
could
never
again
go
to
the
stable
it
was
suddenly
clear
to
her
that
she
could
not
run
about
as
before
and
that
she
could
not
be
happy
any
more
the
chief
reason
for
it
all
was
clear
to
her
the
reason
that
prevented
her
from
being
carefree
and
bright
as
in
the
old
times
she
did
not
answer
but
gave
forth
a
profound
sigh
profounder
than
the
one
she
had
uttered
before
why
do
you
sigh
as
if
you
had
to
carry
a
mountain
about
with
you
a
load
that
keeps
you
from
going
forward
why
do
you
do
it
asked
dino
i
ca
tell
anyone
you
could
either
if
you
had
the
trouble
i
have
replied
the
little
girl
oh
yes
i
could
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
i
could
tell
dino
asserted
if
you
ca
confide
in
other
people
you
can
always
tell
your
mother
for
she
can
always
smooth
everything
out
for
you
just
go
to
her
and
tell
her
about
it
that
will
relieve
you
and
everything
will
come
right
yes
and
now
i
can
say
what
you
said
to
me
before
you
are
lucky
and
much
luckier
than
i
am
said
cornelli
with
a
trembling
voice
i
never
can
go
to
my
mother
because
i
have
none
now
you
see
how
well
off
i
am
i
am
sure
you
would
never
exchange
with
me
would
you
dino
looked
quite
frightened
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
no
mother
he
said
full
of
pity
in
his
mind
he
saw
his
own
mother
the
way
she
looked
at
him
so
full
of
love
that
it
always
lightened
his
heart
whenever
anything
troubled
him
and
poor
cornelli
had
to
miss
all
that
even
the
stable
with
the
horses
the
large
garden
with
all
the
fruit
about
which
martha
had
told
him
so
much
appeared
to
him
now
in
a
different
light
full
of
decision
he
said
no
indeed
i
would
not
change
with
you
but
a
great
pity
for
the
motherless
child
welled
up
in
dino
heart
and
he
longed
to
be
her
protector
he
could
understand
now
why
cornelli
looked
so
strange
he
had
even
noticed
it
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
her
there
was
no
mother
to
fix
everything
the
way
it
should
be
we
try
to
be
friends
cornelli
but
you
must
push
your
hair
back
from
your
forehead
first
of
all
one
can
hardly
see
your
eyes
nobody
wears
hair
like
that
i
do
see
how
such
long
hair
can
stay
there
without
blowing
off
what
on
earth
did
you
paste
it
on
with
with
glue
replied
cornelli
how
nasty
come
i
cut
it
all
off
and
then
your
eyes
and
your
forehead
will
be
clear
you
can
hardly
see
that
way
dino
had
seized
the
scissors
that
were
lying
beside
martha
work
basket
but
cornelli
struggling
against
him
with
both
hands
fairly
screamed
let
it
be
it
has
to
be
that
way
put
the
scissors
away
i
wo
hurt
you
but
do
scream
so
loud
said
dino
quietly
putting
down
the
scissors
again
i
only
wanted
to
do
you
a
favor
if
my
two
sisters
agnes
and
nika
could
see
you
they
would
laugh
at
you
they
would
not
like
the
way
you
pasted
on
those
locks
i
know
that
but
they
do
not
need
to
see
me
at
all
said
cornelli
crossly
nobody
needs
to
see
me
i
know
that
nobody
likes
me
but
i
do
care
with
these
words
cornelli
ran
away
dino
was
terribly
astonished
and
stood
looking
at
the
door
through
which
cornelli
had
disappeared
without
even
a
word
of
farewell
when
martha
again
entered
the
little
room
and
was
looking
at
empty
chair
dino
said
what
a
queer
child
she
is
i
never
thought
she
would
be
so
unfriendly
he
related
how
they
had
passed
the
time
together
and
how
cornelli
had
suddenly
run
off
without
even
saying
he
had
not
wanted
to
offend
her
martha
shook
her
head
and
said
cornelli
never
was
that
way
before
i
am
so
worried
about
her
for
she
is
absolutely
changed
you
must
not
think
that
she
is
queer
and
runs
away
like
that
and
suddenly
gets
cross
she
never
was
that
way
at
all
this
is
something
new
if
i
only
could
hear
her
sing
and
laugh
again
as
of
old
i
hoped
that
her
old
gaiety
would
come
back
with
such
a
good
playfellow
as
you
are
maybe
it
will
after
all
this
is
only
the
first
day
of
your
acquaintance
i
am
sure
cornelli
will
not
come
back
to
me
said
dino
still
quite
puzzled
she
ran
away
so
full
of
anger
when
cornelli
had
exclaimed
i
do
care
it
probably
was
not
true
on
reaching
home
she
quietly
stole
to
her
room
sitting
down
on
a
stool
she
put
her
head
in
both
hands
and
began
to
cry
bitterly
chapter
vi
a
friend
is
found
cornelli
had
not
appeared
at
martha
cottage
for
quite
a
number
of
days
and
so
martha
was
filled
with
grief
and
anxiety
there
were
many
reasons
for
this
first
of
all
she
loved
the
child
as
if
she
had
been
her
own
and
missed
her
daily
visits
terribly
she
also
knew
that
there
was
something
the
matter
with
cornelli
and
that
this
was
the
reason
why
she
did
not
come
from
the
time
the
child
was
small
she
had
run
over
to
her
old
friend
every
single
day
and
had
told
her
everything
martha
was
also
sorry
for
her
guest
sake
that
cornelli
stayed
away
she
had
told
dino
how
merry
and
bright
the
child
could
be
and
how
he
would
enjoy
her
as
a
daily
companion
now
it
had
all
come
to
nothing
in
the
meantime
dino
and
martha
had
become
firm
friends
and
the
old
woman
was
very
eager
to
make
everything
cosy
and
comfortable
for
her
polite
and
friendly
housemate
after
his
daily
walks
and
after
he
had
done
his
school
work
conscientiously
dino
loved
always
to
sit
down
beside
martha
then
she
would
talk
to
him
and
tell
him
many
things
which
dino
loved
to
hear
she
generally
told
about
cornelli
father
and
mother
for
martha
had
known
the
latter
as
a
small
child
before
long
though
she
would
always
begin
to
talk
about
cornelli
for
she
never
tired
of
that
subject
she
assured
dino
that
she
had
never
known
a
more
bright
or
amusing
little
girl
dino
always
assured
her
that
he
could
not
believe
this
and
when
martha
even
asserted
that
cornelli
was
more
attractive
than
any
child
she
had
ever
seen
dino
laughed
she
looks
exactly
like
a
little
owl
he
always
said
one
can
hardly
see
her
eyes
i
should
love
her
to
come
again
though
he
added
for
he
was
curious
to
see
cornelli
when
she
was
funny
and
bright
as
martha
described
her
when
dino
had
gone
to
his
room
that
evening
martha
quickly
put
on
a
better
apron
took
the
big
shawl
from
her
cupboard
and
putting
it
on
her
shoulders
went
quietly
out
of
the
house
and
over
to
the
residence
she
looked
up
at
the
kitchen
windows
and
saw
a
light
there
as
well
as
in
the
room
that
overlooked
the
garden
on
entering
the
kitchen
martha
saw
esther
and
miss
mina
sitting
down
to
a
plentiful
supper
the
latter
was
just
getting
up
to
answer
a
bell
which
had
rung
in
the
dining
room
but
esther
offered
the
empty
seat
to
her
old
acquaintance
sit
down
martha
i
am
sure
you
have
earned
a
rest
the
same
as
i
have
she
said
and
with
these
words
moved
three
platters
and
a
bottle
over
to
the
new
arrival
just
take
it
there
is
a
lot
left
and
i
am
glad
when
it
is
gone
for
then
i
can
plan
something
new
for
thank
you
esther
martha
replied
i
have
already
eaten
supper
it
is
very
nice
of
you
to
invite
me
to
share
it
with
you
but
i
really
ca
how
can
you
refuse
i
simply
wo
have
it
anybody
can
eat
what
i
cook
even
the
emperor
of
russia
himself
i
am
sure
you
are
not
yet
quite
as
mighty
as
that
esther
proceeded
eagerly
loading
a
plate
with
macaroni
and
stewed
plums
please
martha
do
make
a
fuss
just
eat
this
and
drink
this
glass
of
wine
i
do
know
why
you
should
why
should
you
eat
supper
twice
if
it
is
good
martha
did
not
dare
to
refuse
esther
offering
any
more
so
she
began
to
eat
her
second
supper
which
was
much
more
abundant
than
the
first
had
been
what
brings
you
here
so
late
martha
what
is
it
asked
esther
curiously
for
this
visit
was
quite
unusual
i
was
going
to
ask
you
something
esther
and
i
thought
that
i
would
interfere
less
with
your
work
in
the
evening
than
at
any
other
time
martha
answered
cornelli
who
used
to
come
to
me
every
day
has
not
been
to
see
me
all
week
i
thought
that
the
ladies
might
have
objected
to
her
going
to
such
a
humble
old
woman
as
i
am
i
could
understand
that
well
enough
do
you
think
they
have
oh
no
they
do
object
at
all
esther
replied
miss
mina
has
told
them
that
our
master
thinks
well
of
you
but
you
have
no
idea
how
changed
the
child
is
in
all
her
ways
one
hardly
knows
her
any
more
three
or
four
times
a
morning
she
used
to
come
running
in
and
out
of
the
kitchen
she
was
always
singing
and
flying
about
the
garden
like
a
little
bird
at
all
hours
of
the
day
who
picked
all
the
fine
berries
and
the
yellow
plums
the
juicy
dark
red
cherries
from
the
young
trees
over
there
so
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
see
her
cornelli
of
course
and
now
she
wo
even
look
at
anything
all
the
berries
are
dried
up
by
now
and
spoiled
and
the
fine
cherries
too
the
yellow
plums
also
are
lying
under
the
tree
by
the
dozen
they
are
only
meant
for
children
the
ladies
wo
bother
about
them
and
one
ca
cook
them
either
so
they
fall
down
and
lie
there
and
cornelli
never
raises
her
head
when
she
goes
by
them
martha
was
much
too
modest
to
say
how
she
would
have
loved
to
have
a
little
basket
full
of
plums
for
her
young
boarder
she
never
could
give
him
any
fruit
and
she
knew
how
he
would
enjoy
some
but
as
long
as
he
was
staying
with
her
she
could
not
do
it
for
that
would
seem
as
if
she
were
begging
for
herself
yes
esther
she
said
after
a
while
i
certainly
have
noticed
how
changed
cornelli
is
i
pray
to
the
lord
that
everything
will
come
right
in
the
end
of
course
it
is
hard
for
the
child
to
get
used
to
a
new
life
right
away
but
it
surely
will
be
good
for
her
to
have
somebody
looking
after
her
esther
shrugged
her
shoulders
significantly
at
this
but
said
nothing
is
the
child
still
in
her
room
or
has
she
gone
out
esther
do
you
know
i
wanted
to
tell
her
to
come
again
to
see
me
as
long
as
the
ladies
do
object
esther
did
not
need
to
answer
at
that
moment
cornelli
came
stealing
quietly
down
the
hall
when
she
saw
martha
a
ray
of
sunshine
passed
across
her
face
and
she
greeted
the
old
woman
i
came
to
see
if
you
were
ill
said
martha
what
keeps
you
from
coming
to
see
me
cornelli
the
time
has
passed
so
slowly
without
you
child
she
added
holding
cornelli
hand
affectionately
with
me
too
said
cornelli
hoarsely
please
come
and
every
day
the
way
you
used
to
martha
begged
no
i
wo
come
cornelli
answered
why
not
cornelli
martha
asked
full
of
dismay
because
the
boy
is
there
i
do
like
him
and
he
does
not
like
me
cornelli
stated
martha
now
eagerly
told
cornelli
of
the
falsehood
of
this
assertion
she
told
her
how
dino
had
asked
after
her
every
day
and
had
hoped
that
she
would
come
again
it
was
awfully
dull
for
him
to
be
alone
all
day
without
a
playmate
martha
was
quite
sure
that
it
had
not
been
fault
that
she
did
not
like
him
the
boy
had
nothing
at
all
against
her
for
he
was
asking
every
day
that
she
come
back
tell
me
cornelli
martha
said
finally
why
do
you
like
the
boy
he
is
so
nice
i
come
to
see
you
was
cornelli
answer
and
it
sufficed
quite
happily
martha
said
making
cornelli
repeat
her
promise
that
she
would
spend
some
time
next
day
with
her
old
friend
and
the
new
boarder
next
day
cornelli
actually
arrived
at
martha
cottage
at
the
accustomed
time
martha
was
standing
by
her
carnation
pots
on
the
porch
ready
to
greet
the
visitor
who
was
approaching
dino
is
so
glad
that
you
are
coming
cornelli
she
said
offering
her
hand
as
greeting
he
has
just
returned
from
drinking
milk
look
here
he
comes
dino
had
heard
the
arrival
of
martha
expected
friend
and
opening
the
door
had
stepped
out
why
have
you
not
come
for
so
long
he
asked
giving
cornelli
his
hand
i
waited
for
you
every
day
cornelli
gave
no
answer
entering
the
room
together
they
sat
down
just
as
they
did
the
first
day
of
their
acquaintance
martha
went
out
because
she
knew
that
the
children
would
get
along
better
alone
and
she
was
very
anxious
for
the
two
to
become
good
friends
your
small
white
kid
is
growing
more
cunning
every
day
said
dino
you
should
see
it
when
it
bounds
about
so
gaily
i
do
care
if
i
see
it
again
or
not
nothing
matters
at
all
to
me
cornelli
returned
in
a
most
unfriendly
manner
no
this
is
not
true
said
dino
laughing
kindly
when
one
talks
that
way
it
shows
that
one
cares
a
great
deal
and
that
one
is
full
of
bitter
thoughts
just
because
one
ca
have
what
one
wants
i
know
that
very
well
i
do
exactly
the
same
thing
cornelli
was
so
astonished
by
dino
knowledge
in
the
matter
that
she
gazed
at
him
dumfounded
oh
yes
i
know
how
it
is
he
repeated
but
you
do
not
need
to
be
bitter
because
you
lead
the
finest
life
anyone
possibly
could
i
always
think
so
each
morning
and
evening
when
i
go
over
to
the
stable
to
drink
my
milk
what
a
wonderful
garden
you
have
i
never
saw
such
fruit
a
whole
tree
full
of
plums
and
all
the
berries
on
the
bushes
and
then
the
two
fine
horses
that
are
kept
separately
in
your
stable
for
you
matthew
has
told
me
that
your
father
drives
with
you
every
week
and
that
you
can
have
everything
in
the
house
and
in
the
garden
for
you
are
the
only
child
oh
if
only
there
were
twelve
or
twenty
children
in
the
house
then
everything
would
be
different
cornelli
broke
forth
passionately
but
i
am
always
alone
and
never
can
say
a
word
to
anybody
and
if
one
is
made
so
that
everybody
hates
and
despises
one
and
if
no
one
in
the
whole
world
can
help
one
and
everything
gets
worse
all
the
time
do
not
know
how
it
is
i
only
wish
i
could
die
right
away
here
cornelli
burst
into
sudden
tears
putting
her
head
on
the
table
she
sobbed
violently
dino
looked
quite
frightened
he
had
never
intended
to
make
cornelli
sad
and
he
could
not
understand
what
she
had
said
but
he
remembered
that
she
had
no
mother
and
so
he
could
understand
her
tears
for
that
was
dreadfully
sad
that
seemed
more
cause
for
tears
than
that
she
was
an
only
child
the
thought
filled
him
with
deep
compassion
for
her
and
he
said
softly
come
cornelli
it
is
terribly
sad
that
you
have
no
mother
but
you
must
not
think
that
therefore
you
are
all
alone
and
nobody
wants
to
help
you
i
be
your
friend
and
i
help
you
but
you
must
tell
me
what
troubles
you
i
do
not
understand
from
what
you
have
said
please
explain
it
all
to
me
no
i
ca
do
that
i
ca
tell
anyone
cornelli
said
between
her
sobs
oh
yes
you
can
do
cry
any
more
and
i
help
you
i
can
surely
find
a
way
please
tell
me
dino
took
cornelli
hand
and
gently
pulled
it
away
from
her
eyes
no
no
i
ca
she
said
timidly
oh
yes
you
can
first
of
all
we
push
your
hair
away
it
is
all
sticking
to
your
forehead
and
your
eyes
you
can
hardly
see
dino
pushed
the
hair
away
as
much
as
he
was
able
but
it
was
still
hanging
down
and
sticking
fast
oh
now
you
see
it
and
then
you
make
a
great
noise
i
know
cornelli
exclaimed
desperately
i
do
not
see
anything
except
that
you
look
a
thousand
times
better
that
way
than
with
these
thick
drooping
fringes
all
over
your
face
said
dino
no
let
them
be
i
know
exactly
how
it
is
cried
cornelli
making
an
effort
to
push
her
hair
back
again
only
you
wo
say
it
because
you
want
to
be
my
friend
but
i
know
it
and
everybody
can
see
it
and
hate
me
but
cornelli
why
are
you
crying
said
dino
full
of
astonishment
i
do
know
what
you
mean
and
i
am
sure
you
are
imagining
something
you
must
be
for
one
often
does
no
i
not
and
there
are
people
who
can
see
it
you
must
not
think
that
i
imagine
something
dino
otherwise
i
would
not
be
so
frightened
that
i
often
can
not
go
to
sleep
for
a
long
long
while
i
have
to
think
and
think
all
the
time
i
know
that
it
will
get
worse
and
worse
and
that
i
wo
be
able
to
cover
it
up
in
the
end
then
there
wo
be
a
single
person
in
the
world
who
does
not
hate
me
when
he
looks
at
me
you
too
will
hate
me
then
i
know
i
swear
to
you
right
now
that
i
shall
not
hate
you
whatever
should
appear
dino
exclaimed
enthusiastically
just
tell
me
for
once
and
all
what
you
mean
please
do
it
for
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
and
give
you
some
advice
just
tell
me
for
you
know
now
that
i
will
remain
your
friend
in
spite
of
everything
that
might
turn
up
cornelli
still
hesitated
but
will
you
still
be
my
friend
later
on
when
everything
is
still
more
changed
and
nobody
else
will
be
my
friend
she
asked
persistently
yes
i
promise
and
here
is
my
hand
said
dino
giving
the
little
girl
a
hearty
handshake
you
can
see
that
i
really
mean
it
for
what
one
has
promised
that
way
one
can
never
take
back
now
you
can
be
sure
that
i
shall
always
be
your
friend
cornelli
face
lit
up
with
joy
it
was
obviously
a
great
comfort
to
her
to
have
a
friend
who
would
remain
so
for
all
time
so
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
but
you
must
promise
not
to
tell
anyone
in
the
whole
wide
world
about
it
as
long
as
you
live
dino
promised
giving
his
hand
again
for
solemn
assurance
look
here
on
both
sides
of
my
forehead
said
cornelli
now
hesitating
a
little
and
pushing
the
fringes
of
hair
out
of
her
face
i
have
two
large
bumps
they
grow
all
the
time
and
especially
when
i
frown
i
have
to
make
a
cross
face
all
the
time
for
i
can
not
be
jolly
any
more
and
can
never
laugh
again
so
the
bumps
keep
on
growing
and
in
the
end
they
will
be
just
like
regular
horns
then
everyone
will
hate
me
for
nobody
else
has
horns
i
can
do
nothing
now
but
hide
them
but
in
the
end
they
will
come
through
and
then
my
hair
wo
hide
them
any
more
then
everybody
can
see
it
and
people
will
despise
me
and
children
will
be
sure
to
throw
stones
after
me
oh
cornelli
again
put
her
head
on
her
arms
and
groaned
in
her
great
trouble
dino
had
listened
full
of
astonishment
he
had
never
before
heard
anything
like
that
but
cornelli
he
said
why
do
you
frown
all
the
time
if
the
bumps
grow
when
you
do
it
it
would
be
so
much
better
if
you
would
think
of
funny
things
and
would
try
to
laugh
if
you
always
made
a
pleasant
face
they
would
perhaps
go
away
entirely
i
ca
i
ca
possibly
do
it
cornelli
lamented
i
know
that
i
make
a
horrid
face
and
that
i
am
so
ugly
that
nobody
wants
to
look
at
me
whenever
anybody
looks
at
me
i
have
to
make
a
cross
face
for
i
know
that
everybody
thinks
how
horrid
i
look
i
never
can
be
happy
any
more
because
i
have
to
think
all
the
time
about
that
terrible
thing
on
my
head
and
that
it
is
getting
worse
and
i
ca
help
it
and
can
do
nothing
you
do
know
how
it
is
as
long
as
i
live
i
have
to
be
that
way
and
everybody
will
hate
me
you
could
not
laugh
any
more
either
if
you
were
like
that
you
should
try
to
think
of
quite
different
things
and
then
you
would
forget
it
later
on
it
would
probably
seem
quite
different
to
you
you
keep
on
thinking
about
it
all
the
time
and
so
you
believe
in
it
more
and
more
get
it
out
of
your
head
then
it
will
be
sure
to
get
better
said
dino
who
could
not
quite
understand
it
come
i
tell
you
a
story
that
will
change
your
thoughts
once
upon
a
time
there
was
an
old
copper
pan
you
have
laughed
already
oh
that
will
be
a
fine
kind
of
story
about
an
old
copper
pan
cornelli
said
it
certainly
is
a
fine
story
dino
assured
her
just
listen
she
had
a
who
was
a
wash
boiler
you
see
you
have
laughed
again
that
the
way
so
they
went
together
to
paris
where
there
was
a
revolution
what
is
a
revolution
cornelli
asked
quite
thrilled
see
how
the
story
interests
you
said
dino
thoroughly
pleased
you
have
no
more
wrinkles
on
your
forehead
because
you
are
listening
well
did
i
guess
what
you
have
to
do
i
go
on
now
you
call
it
a
revolution
when
nobody
wants
to
remain
in
their
old
places
and
everything
goes
to
pieces
what
do
you
mean
by
going
to
pieces
do
you
mean
it
the
way
chairs
begin
to
go
to
pieces
when
the
glue
comes
off
and
the
legs
get
loose
and
shaky
just
that
way
dino
assented
when
all
laws
and
orders
begin
to
go
to
pieces
like
chairs
when
the
glue
is
off
and
everything
crashes
and
tumbles
down
do
you
understand
yes
and
what
happened
cornelli
wanted
to
know
the
travellers
liked
that
well
dino
continued
for
they
were
full
of
discontented
thoughts
the
copper
pan
had
thought
for
a
long
time
that
she
wanted
to
be
something
else
she
was
tired
of
cooking
greasy
food
and
of
all
the
time
being
full
of
soot
at
the
bottom
she
wanted
to
be
something
better
the
wash
boiler
had
similar
thoughts
he
thought
he
would
be
much
better
off
as
a
nice
tea
kettle
he
thought
how
nice
it
would
be
to
stand
on
a
fine
table
so
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
laundry
when
they
came
to
the
revolution
they
joined
in
it
too
they
became
quite
famous
making
speeches
for
they
both
could
talk
very
well
the
wash
boiler
had
learned
it
from
the
washer
women
and
the
copper
pan
from
the
cook
so
they
were
both
asked
what
they
wanted
to
become
the
copper
pan
wanted
to
become
an
ice
box
she
wanted
to
sparkle
outside
with
fine
wood
and
inside
with
splendid
ice
the
wash
boiler
wanted
to
become
a
fine
tea
kettle
and
be
able
to
stand
on
a
finely
table
so
they
both
became
what
they
had
wished
but
the
copper
pan
who
had
been
used
to
the
cosy
fire
began
to
shake
and
freeze
when
the
ice
filled
her
whole
inside
her
teeth
were
chattering
while
she
looked
about
to
see
if
she
could
discover
a
little
fire
anywhere
but
nobody
ever
brought
any
burning
spark
near
her
she
suffered
the
bitterest
hunger
besides
because
she
had
been
used
to
quite
different
nourishment
from
fat
morsels
roasting
in
her
insides
now
she
had
to
swallow
little
lumps
of
ice
and
nothing
else
she
was
not
a
bit
pleased
with
shining
outside
and
in
for
she
had
to
think
all
the
time
how
terrible
it
is
to
starve
and
freeze
to
death
the
tea
kettle
meanwhile
was
standing
on
a
beautifully
set
table
many
splendidly
dressed
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
sitting
around
him
and
drinking
tea
out
of
fine
china
cups
and
eating
from
lovely
plates
the
tea
kettle
felt
flattered
and
said
to
himself
now
i
can
be
anybody
equal
but
one
of
the
ladies
said
can
smell
tar
soap
and
i
think
it
comes
from
this
tea
kettle
i
wonder
what
that
means
her
neighbor
laughed
and
said
noticed
it
long
ago
i
hope
it
has
not
been
used
for
washing
stockings
so
they
looked
at
the
kettle
and
sniffed
and
turned
up
their
noses
with
disdain
the
tea
kettle
lost
his
assurance
for
he
knew
quite
well
that
many
hundreds
of
stockings
had
been
boiled
inside
of
him
the
poor
thing
had
never
guessed
that
the
smell
of
tar
soap
would
stick
to
him
in
his
new
shape
he
felt
very
cramped
and
uncomfortable
in
the
society
he
was
in
and
was
possessed
with
the
thought
of
getting
away
and
returning
to
the
place
where
he
had
been
comfortable
and
had
been
held
in
high
esteem
for
he
had
really
been
a
boiler
then
suddenly
the
revolution
ceased
the
lady
of
the
house
who
owned
the
ice
box
said
do
not
want
the
horrible
ice
box
any
more
which
they
have
exchanged
for
my
good
old
ice
box
all
the
ice
that
comes
out
of
it
tastes
of
onion
soup
the
copper
pan
had
always
cooked
this
soup
better
than
any
other
throw
it
out
to
the
old
iron
heap
said
the
lady
so
lulu
the
butler
and
lala
the
maid
took
the
ice
box
and
with
terrible
might
threw
her
down
on
the
scrap
heap
where
old
iron
bones
and
dirt
lay
in
the
back
yard
the
ice
box
felt
that
all
her
limbs
were
giving
way
and
that
everything
was
going
to
end
badly
she
lamented
if
only
i
had
not
joined
the
revolution
if
i
had
only
stayed
at
home
by
the
cosy
fire
oh
if
only
and
with
that
she
cracked
completely
on
the
same
day
the
young
lady
on
whose
table
the
kettle
was
standing
said
i
have
had
enough
of
this
horrid
boiler
i
want
a
genuine
tea
kettle
and
not
an
imitation
away
with
this
thing
so
the
butler
took
the
kettle
and
dashed
him
down
to
the
heap
of
rubbish
in
the
yard
it
was
the
same
rubbish
heap
where
his
had
been
thrown
and
in
his
fall
he
broke
his
own
and
his
last
bones
then
he
exclaimed
in
bitter
pain
if
only
i
had
not
joined
the
revolution
oh
if
i
were
only
home
in
the
peaceful
steaming
laundry
then
he
was
completely
smashed
by
the
old
muskets
that
were
used
in
the
revolution
and
that
had
been
thrown
down
on
top
of
him
and
this
is
the
end
of
the
story
yes
they
were
right
if
only
they
had
not
joined
the
revolution
cornelli
said
sympathetically
yes
and
i
am
right
too
dino
cried
triumphantly
just
see
how
much
it
helped
you
to
forget
your
curious
bump
affair
you
have
no
more
wrinkles
on
your
forehead
and
you
have
pushed
all
your
hair
away
you
look
entirely
different
i
hardly
know
you
now
cornelli
in
very
truth
had
been
so
eager
in
listening
to
the
story
that
with
one
quick
motion
she
had
pushed
the
hanging
curtains
out
of
her
eyes
she
had
been
anxious
not
to
miss
a
word
and
the
hair
had
bothered
her
very
much
her
whole
face
had
become
bright
and
changed
during
the
thrilling
tale
just
look
at
yourself
dino
encouraged
her
taking
a
little
mirror
from
the
wall
and
holding
it
in
front
of
the
little
girl
no
no
i
do
not
want
to
see
it
she
cried
out
in
the
same
moment
she
had
pulled
her
hair
back
again
over
her
eyes
and
on
her
forehead
appeared
a
lot
of
wrinkles
do
get
so
excited
said
dino
putting
back
the
mirror
but
i
am
awfully
glad
to
know
a
way
to
help
you
i
shall
do
it
every
day
but
you
must
promise
to
come
regularly
i
am
sure
you
forget
everything
else
that
worries
you
and
in
the
end
you
forget
about
it
and
so
be
gay
again
cornelli
shook
her
head
no
you
ca
prevent
it
from
getting
worse
she
said
covering
her
forehead
with
more
hair
however
she
took
dino
hand
as
a
promise
to
come
again
for
she
had
enjoyed
her
visit
very
much
and
was
looking
forward
to
repeating
it
from
that
day
on
cornelli
wandered
over
to
martha
little
house
as
she
had
always
done
the
old
woman
cried
with
joy
when
she
heard
the
child
merry
laughter
after
all
that
time
for
it
had
been
a
great
grief
to
her
to
see
the
bright
child
so
terribly
changed
she
loved
to
leave
the
children
by
themselves
for
then
they
always
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
best
from
time
to
time
she
heard
their
happy
laughter
it
thrilled
her
with
joy
and
she
never
wanted
to
interrupt
it
she
had
seen
how
cornelli
behaved
when
listening
to
one
of
dino
stories
the
little
girl
was
as
eager
as
if
she
were
experiencing
it
all
herself
in
her
burning
zeal
she
would
fling
back
her
hair
her
eyes
would
sparkle
as
in
days
gone
by
and
a
brightly
laughing
face
would
regard
the
story
teller
everything
else
was
forgotten
for
the
time
but
if
something
reminded
cornelli
of
her
own
life
and
troubles
all
sunshine
was
suddenly
gone
from
her
face
her
forehead
clouded
up
and
the
horrible
sticky
hair
was
again
hanging
over
her
eyes
so
martha
always
tried
to
leave
the
children
undisturbed
she
had
many
hopes
for
cornelli
on
account
of
this
daily
intercourse
with
the
charming
boy
whose
clear
brow
was
never
troubled
and
who
could
so
quickly
drive
away
the
clouds
from
his
friend
face
as
soon
as
cornelli
left
the
little
house
and
was
approaching
her
own
garden
everything
changed
back
to
the
old
condition
martha
looking
after
the
child
could
always
see
the
fearful
looking
hair
that
so
strangely
disfigured
the
little
girl
pretty
face
then
she
would
sigh
deeply
and
would
say
to
herself
it
seems
like
a
disease
but
who
can
help
her
oh
if
our
blessed
lady
had
seen
her
child
so
terribly
disfigured
cornelli
was
very
much
surprised
when
she
found
that
saturday
evening
had
come
again
for
the
last
two
weeks
had
flown
by
very
fast
she
ran
through
the
garden
under
the
plum
tree
lay
the
last
fully
ripened
dark
gold
plums
cornelli
picked
them
up
they
were
really
splendid
but
they
had
given
her
no
pleasure
that
year
she
took
them
with
her
and
put
them
on
martha
table
oh
what
fine
yellow
plums
i
am
sure
they
taste
as
sweet
as
honey
exclaimed
dino
are
they
from
your
garden
when
the
sun
shines
on
them
in
the
morning
all
the
branches
seem
to
sparkle
with
reddish
gold
like
a
christmas
tree
yes
they
are
from
the
tree
do
you
want
to
eat
them
asked
cornelli
with
pleasure
but
you
must
eat
some
too
said
dino
no
i
do
want
to
cornelli
replied
just
try
whether
they
are
good
if
you
do
not
like
them
you
can
leave
them
or
give
them
to
the
birds
oh
but
there
is
nothing
that
tastes
as
sweet
and
splendid
as
these
golden
plums
cried
dino
while
he
was
slowly
eating
one
after
another
what
a
shame
i
wish
i
had
known
how
much
you
like
them
you
really
ought
to
have
told
me
cornelli
said
there
are
none
left
on
the
tree
and
they
are
the
last
that
were
lying
on
the
grass
but
very
soon
we
have
the
best
juicy
pears
they
are
perfectly
delicious
i
think
even
better
and
then
i
bring
you
some
every
day
yes
it
certainly
would
be
great
to
have
a
pear
feast
with
you
every
day
said
dino
looking
admiringly
at
the
last
reddish
plum
before
he
ate
it
it
is
easy
enough
for
you
cornelli
you
can
stay
right
here
under
the
pear
tree
but
i
have
to
go
away
i
have
to
spend
my
time
behind
the
school
house
walls
regretting
all
that
i
have
lost
but
you
are
not
going
away
said
cornelli
with
dismay
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
this
happy
companionship
could
ever
end
yes
i
have
to
if
i
could
i
would
stay
here
much
longer
with
our
good
friend
martha
she
is
better
than
anybody
i
know
except
my
mother
and
she
takes
care
of
me
as
if
i
were
a
silkworm
yes
and
when
you
go
everything
is
over
said
cornelli
speaking
as
if
dino
were
her
enemy
her
eyes
glowed
at
him
from
under
her
hair
and
she
seemed
to
be
accusing
him
of
some
bitter
wrong
she
now
turned
away
as
if
to
say
now
i
do
not
want
to
hear
of
anything
more
but
dino
understood
her
sudden
anger
no
cornelli
he
said
soothingly
just
the
opposite
will
happen
it
is
not
over
at
all
because
it
has
only
just
begun
i
have
planned
with
martha
that
i
shall
come
again
next
summer
and
the
summer
after
and
every
year
after
that
till
we
are
both
old
and
gray
but
cornelli
only
saw
the
immediate
future
before
her
and
what
was
going
to
happen
now
she
could
not
look
so
far
ahead
yes
but
it
is
so
long
till
next
year
that
you
are
sure
to
forget
all
about
me
a
hundred
times
she
said
crossly
as
if
she
were
chiding
her
companion
no
i
wo
do
that
said
dino
quietly
i
wo
forget
you
once
least
of
all
a
hundred
times
i
prove
it
to
you
cornelli
let
us
still
have
a
good
time
together
and
enjoy
the
four
remaining
days
that
i
can
stay
here
let
us
look
forward
also
to
the
time
when
i
shall
come
again
just
think
how
much
the
kid
will
have
grown
by
then
we
shall
be
able
to
drive
together
i
be
the
coachman
and
you
be
the
lady
in
the
carriage
that
will
be
splendid
but
cornelli
could
no
longer
be
really
gay
she
always
saw
the
moment
before
her
when
dino
had
to
say
and
when
all
their
fun
would
be
over
the
morning
really
came
fast
enough
when
she
had
to
take
leave
of
him
in
martha
cottage
after
dino
had
driven
away
cornelli
buried
her
head
in
her
arms
and
cried
piteously
martha
too
was
heavy
of
heart
and
sat
beside
her
crying
quietly
that
same
evening
when
dinner
was
done
and
cornelli
got
up
from
table
to
leave
the
room
the
cousin
said
you
have
not
said
a
single
word
cornelli
you
seem
to
get
worse
instead
of
better
ought
your
father
find
you
worse
on
coming
home
than
when
he
left
said
cornelli
hoarsely
and
left
the
room
without
once
looking
up
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
with
her
you
can
see
it
for
yourself
betty
you
have
thought
that
we
could
still
produce
a
change
for
the
better
said
miss
dorner
after
cornelli
had
shut
the
door
behind
her
what
have
we
accomplished
with
our
best
efforts
we
have
tried
hard
enough
for
her
father
sake
how
terrible
it
will
be
for
him
to
live
alone
with
her
again
instead
of
cheering
his
lonely
life
she
will
only
cause
him
worry
and
trouble
and
what
a
sight
she
is
have
you
ever
seen
an
obstinacy
equal
to
hers
in
all
your
life
no
never
replied
the
friend
it
actually
seems
as
if
all
the
helpful
words
we
have
spoken
had
the
opposite
effect
with
her
whenever
we
told
her
how
terrible
she
looked
the
disfiguring
hair
fringes
always
seemed
to
get
worse
i
should
like
to
know
what
one
could
do
to
break
her
stubborn
will
maybe
great
severity
would
do
it
or
bringing
together
cornelli
and
other
children
they
might
cure
her
by
laughing
at
her
i
do
not
believe
so
for
nothing
seems
to
help
miss
dorner
concluded
my
cousin
himself
when
he
comes
back
shall
decide
what
to
do
with
her
but
i
know
that
one
thing
is
certain
whatever
will
be
done
she
will
never
be
a
joy
to
her
father
chapter
vii
a
new
sorrow
autumn
had
come
and
all
the
fruit
trees
in
hellmut
garden
were
laden
with
gorgeous
fruit
bright
red
apples
and
golden
pears
were
shining
through
the
green
branches
dark
blue
plums
honey
sweet
fell
here
and
there
from
the
deeply
weighted
trees
whoever
passed
the
garden
had
to
stand
still
and
look
full
of
wonder
at
this
great
abundance
and
many
a
person
was
tempted
to
leap
over
the
hedge
and
get
one
of
the
golden
pears
as
a
prize
cornelli
staring
in
front
of
her
was
sitting
on
the
bench
under
the
hazel
nut
tree
matthew
was
just
approaching
from
the
stable
he
wore
his
best
coat
and
one
could
see
that
something
special
was
going
on
do
you
want
to
come
with
me
cornelli
he
asked
walking
over
to
the
bench
where
she
was
sitting
i
am
just
going
to
harness
the
horses
your
father
is
coming
at
eleven
and
i
am
going
to
drive
down
to
the
lake
to
meet
him
come
with
me
our
brown
fellows
will
be
sure
to
trot
well
for
they
have
had
a
long
rest
come
along
it
will
be
fun
i
know
cornelli
shook
her
head
no
said
matthew
with
disappointment
i
was
sure
you
would
not
let
slip
a
chance
of
driving
gaily
out
into
the
bright
morning
to
meet
your
father
shall
i
get
you
down
some
pears
no
pears
either
matthew
went
away
shaking
his
head
if
our
master
only
had
half
a
dozen
boys
and
as
many
girls
how
nice
it
would
be
here
on
the
place
then
such
splendid
pears
would
not
be
hanging
sad
and
forgotten
on
the
trees
then
he
added
in
a
murmur
not
even
to
care
about
driving
with
such
horses
soon
afterwards
maelinger
arrived
for
it
was
time
for
lessons
most
of
the
time
the
teacher
sat
beside
his
pupil
shaking
his
head
he
really
needed
all
his
patience
to
endure
the
total
indifference
she
showed
in
all
her
tasks
it
was
again
the
same
the
two
hours
passed
and
the
carriage
which
was
bringing
home
her
father
had
just
driven
up
in
front
of
the
house
maelinger
was
filled
with
astonishment
for
his
pupil
instead
of
jumping
up
happily
and
running
away
to
greet
her
father
looked
shyly
through
the
window
and
did
not
budge
you
can
go
cornelli
your
father
is
here
we
have
finished
our
work
he
said
and
with
these
words
departed
cornelli
had
heard
her
father
coming
into
the
house
and
had
heard
the
ladies
joyful
words
of
welcome
she
crushed
a
tear
that
had
begun
to
trickle
down
her
cheek
and
went
over
to
the
room
where
her
father
had
just
entered
how
are
you
child
have
you
come
at
last
the
father
called
gaily
to
her
but
how
strange
you
look
cornelli
he
went
on
with
a
changed
voice
what
is
it
cornelli
had
silently
given
him
her
hand
and
was
shyly
looking
down
what
has
happened
to
you
how
odd
you
look
i
hardly
know
you
any
more
push
away
all
that
hair
from
your
face
why
do
you
look
at
me
pleasantly
why
do
you
keep
looking
away
for
months
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
this
to
my
little
daughter
who
i
had
hoped
would
have
gained
much
so
this
is
the
way
i
am
to
find
you
cornelli
full
of
sorrow
and
anger
the
father
was
gazing
at
the
little
girl
she
had
turned
away
and
had
not
said
a
word
her
face
half
hidden
by
the
horrible
hair
strands
seemed
to
be
covered
by
a
gray
cloud
which
threatened
to
break
out
in
a
violent
rain
we
shall
talk
it
all
over
later
frederick
said
the
cousin
let
us
first
enjoy
and
celebrate
the
happy
hour
of
your
return
and
let
us
keep
all
troublesome
thoughts
away
with
these
words
miss
dorner
led
her
cousin
to
the
dining
room
where
the
table
was
festively
set
with
all
the
good
dishes
esther
knew
were
her
master
favorites
the
director
thoughts
however
were
so
troubled
that
even
the
festive
meal
could
not
dispel
them
he
barely
touched
the
food
that
was
offered
for
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
his
only
child
she
sat
in
front
of
him
with
bowed
head
and
only
now
and
then
looked
up
at
him
quite
shyly
the
meal
did
not
go
through
in
a
very
festive
spirit
it
was
noticeable
that
hellmut
had
to
force
himself
to
the
few
words
he
spoke
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
and
were
of
a
very
disturbing
nature
he
got
up
from
the
table
as
soon
as
possible
and
hurried
away
he
is
going
over
to
the
works
said
miss
dorner
to
her
friend
following
him
with
her
eyes
cornelli
too
had
left
the
room
as
soon
as
her
father
had
gone
i
think
it
has
upset
him
more
than
i
thought
it
would
he
has
to
give
vent
to
his
excitement
a
little
and
i
hope
that
seeing
the
workmen
over
there
will
help
him
to
get
over
his
impression
i
hope
he
will
hear
there
many
new
and
pleasant
things
of
much
work
and
good
business
it
is
hard
for
him
to
carry
on
his
endless
work
for
the
sake
of
such
a
child
do
you
think
so
but
it
be
changed
after
a
while
the
director
came
back
again
he
did
not
look
much
soothed
or
pleasantly
surprised
by
what
he
had
just
heard
the
ladies
now
sat
down
again
to
drink
a
cup
of
coffee
with
him
they
have
spoiled
many
things
for
me
over
there
said
the
director
sitting
down
beside
them
even
if
it
should
mean
considerable
loss
i
can
bear
it
but
i
can
not
stand
the
way
cornelli
has
changed
what
a
frightful
sight
she
is
and
how
dumb
and
stupid
she
has
grown
she
did
not
show
the
slightest
sign
of
pleasure
at
my
coming
and
has
not
said
a
single
word
since
then
she
has
hardly
even
looked
at
me
and
only
sits
there
as
if
her
existence
were
a
real
misfortune
i
can
not
stand
it
what
has
happened
to
the
child
in
his
excitement
hellmut
jumped
up
and
paced
about
the
room
nothing
has
happened
to
the
child
at
least
we
know
of
nothing
do
we
betty
said
miss
dorner
we
have
both
tried
to
teach
her
good
manners
for
we
found
that
she
lacked
them
sadly
we
did
it
chiefly
on
your
account
sorry
as
i
am
to
say
it
frederick
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
child
disposition
is
so
terribly
obstinate
one
can
hardly
do
anything
with
her
the
more
we
fought
against
it
and
tried
to
bring
her
on
the
right
path
the
worse
it
got
and
the
more
she
would
insist
on
having
her
way
what
have
we
not
said
against
this
terrible
disfigurement
and
all
for
nothing
the
more
we
said
the
more
cornelli
would
pull
her
hair
into
her
eyes
so
i
gave
it
up
for
i
saw
that
only
physical
punishment
would
help
in
such
a
case
and
i
wanted
to
leave
that
to
you
i
did
not
come
into
your
house
for
that
i
do
not
even
dare
to
decide
if
that
would
help
i
have
really
never
in
all
my
life
seen
such
a
stubborn
child
i
shall
certainly
admire
anybody
who
can
bring
her
to
rights
the
director
had
marched
up
and
down
the
room
with
restless
steps
now
he
suddenly
stood
still
but
good
gracious
he
exclaimed
there
must
certainly
be
a
way
to
help
a
child
of
ten
years
are
there
no
means
except
chastisement
to
bring
up
a
young
creature
like
her
what
an
abominable
thought
i
will
not
believe
such
a
thing
can
you
give
me
no
advice
what
could
i
do
ladies
surely
know
how
to
educate
a
little
girl
something
simply
has
to
be
done
right
away
i
am
to
blame
for
my
neglect
and
for
leaving
her
too
long
in
the
wrong
hands
oh
what
would
my
cornelia
say
if
she
could
see
her
child
hellmut
threw
himself
down
in
his
chair
and
put
his
hands
before
his
face
please
calm
yourself
frederick
it
is
not
your
fault
at
all
for
you
ca
fight
against
her
disposition
the
cousin
said
soothingly
we
have
thought
of
a
way
of
helping
the
child
you
might
send
her
to
a
boarding
school
in
town
where
there
are
a
great
many
children
and
young
girls
children
often
help
each
other
by
rubbing
up
against
one
another
and
by
noticing
each
other
faults
and
mistakes
do
you
think
that
this
might
help
cornelli
asked
the
father
doubtfully
cornelli
is
not
used
to
being
rubbed
against
and
laughed
at
for
that
reason
it
would
make
a
still
deeper
impression
on
her
answered
the
cousin
you
can
believe
me
when
i
say
that
this
may
be
the
only
means
to
break
her
obstinacy
and
i
am
not
sure
that
even
this
will
help
if
such
a
school
ca
break
her
will
nobody
on
earth
can
reform
her
you
can
believe
me
frederick
she
is
still
very
young
to
be
sent
away
from
home
said
the
father
full
of
pity
but
i
fear
that
you
are
right
she
could
not
get
better
here
only
worse
and
so
it
will
probably
have
to
be
do
you
know
of
a
boarding
school
you
could
recommend
the
cousin
answered
that
she
knew
of
one
and
offered
to
take
the
necessary
steps
as
soon
as
she
was
again
at
home
miss
dorner
hoped
in
vain
that
her
cousin
humor
would
change
and
that
he
would
become
again
the
merry
and
sociable
companion
of
old
days
he
tried
with
all
his
might
to
be
entertaining
when
they
met
at
table
but
he
always
had
to
glance
at
his
little
girl
who
sat
at
her
place
dumb
and
seemingly
afraid
even
to
glance
about
her
a
deep
shadow
always
came
across
his
features
and
one
could
see
that
it
was
hard
for
him
to
mingle
in
the
general
conversation
miss
dorner
at
last
had
enough
of
his
unfriendly
attitude
as
a
last
means
to
break
it
and
to
shake
him
up
a
little
she
said
to
him
on
the
third
day
after
his
arrival
it
seems
to
me
frederick
that
you
are
too
much
occupied
even
to
remember
your
duties
as
a
host
we
are
thinking
of
going
back
to
town
are
you
willing
i
understand
your
decision
absolutely
hellmut
answered
politely
you
are
right
in
telling
me
that
i
am
the
most
unpleasant
host
that
could
be
found
but
i
hope
you
understand
that
the
change
in
cornelli
has
spoiled
everything
for
me
and
has
only
filled
me
with
the
thought
of
how
to
help
her
i
hope
very
much
that
you
will
visit
my
house
again
at
a
pleasanter
time
you
can
order
the
carriage
whenever
you
want
it
the
cousin
had
not
expected
this
answer
you
go
entirely
too
far
frederick
she
said
angrily
how
can
a
man
sacrifice
everything
and
change
all
his
ideas
for
the
sake
of
such
a
child
you
seem
to
forget
that
it
is
my
cornelia
and
my
only
child
answered
the
director
but
we
shall
not
talk
about
it
any
more
because
we
could
not
understand
each
other
i
am
so
grateful
for
your
goodwill
that
i
do
not
want
to
cause
you
any
anger
at
the
end
two
days
later
the
carriage
stood
before
the
door
both
ladies
stepped
in
and
mina
stepped
in
after
them
the
latter
had
known
so
well
how
to
make
herself
liked
by
them
that
they
were
taking
her
to
town
for
mina
had
wished
to
become
a
maid
in
the
city
to
get
away
from
country
people
one
of
the
ladies
was
to
take
her
as
chambermaid
but
it
had
not
been
settled
yet
which
of
them
would
do
so
esther
was
terribly
indignant
because
mina
was
leaving
a
good
house
for
no
reason
whatsoever
since
esther
had
been
managing
in
the
director
home
she
had
always
felt
the
honor
of
the
house
to
be
her
own
full
of
resentment
she
was
standing
behind
her
master
who
was
shaking
hands
as
a
last
farewell
miss
mina
was
looking
towards
the
other
side
where
cornelli
stood
wo
you
even
give
me
your
hand
this
is
not
very
friendly
of
you
that
is
just
the
way
you
are
she
said
to
the
child
in
a
low
voice
now
esther
broke
forth
miss
mina
she
called
out
as
loudly
as
she
could
please
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
the
ladies
on
the
trip
who
left
the
dusty
marks
on
the
sofa
by
standing
on
it
they
were
not
from
a
child
shoe
mina
blushed
a
deep
scarlet
and
miss
dorner
full
of
astonishment
looked
at
her
glowing
face
she
expected
a
fitting
retort
but
none
came
go
ahead
matthew
miss
dorner
ordered
excitedly
she
did
not
desire
a
further
explanation
hellmut
had
moved
away
cornelli
now
took
esther
broad
hand
inside
both
her
own
and
pressed
it
hard
a
ray
of
joy
flitted
over
her
features
the
first
after
a
long
long
time
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
you
said
that
esther
i
am
more
glad
than
you
can
think
she
said
eagerly
if
you
had
not
said
that
they
would
have
thought
all
their
lives
that
i
had
done
it
and
denied
it
but
how
does
mina
know
who
did
it
she
knows
because
she
did
it
herself
esther
replied
oh
oh
so
she
did
it
with
her
own
feet
cornelli
exclaimed
it
is
better
that
she
has
gone
then
we
rather
be
left
alone
here
we
esther
just
you
and
i
yes
indeed
said
the
cook
full
of
satisfaction
just
tell
your
father
that
i
do
not
mind
double
work
but
that
i
do
mind
deceitful
ways
cornelli
had
not
spoken
to
her
father
since
he
had
come
back
she
was
shy
before
him
because
she
realized
that
the
sight
of
her
displeased
him
she
was
however
quite
sure
that
she
could
never
change
and
always
had
to
be
like
that
she
was
also
certain
that
he
would
only
abhor
her
more
if
he
ever
found
out
what
was
hidden
under
her
locks
of
hair
she
therefore
went
slowly
and
hesitatingly
towards
his
room
in
order
to
give
him
esther
message
in
former
times
she
had
always
run
to
him
gaily
whenever
she
had
something
to
tell
him
since
then
things
had
changed
it
will
never
again
be
that
way
she
said
to
herself
the
thought
seemed
to
weigh
so
heavily
on
her
that
she
suddenly
stood
still
at
that
moment
her
father
opened
the
door
in
front
of
which
she
stood
oh
here
you
are
cornelli
he
said
delightedly
did
you
want
to
pay
me
a
little
visit
we
have
really
hardly
seen
each
other
come
in
here
i
was
just
going
to
get
you
for
i
want
to
speak
with
you
cornelli
entered
not
saying
a
word
and
avoiding
her
father
glance
come
cornelli
he
said
leading
her
through
the
room
and
sitting
down
beside
her
i
have
something
to
tell
you
that
will
make
you
very
happy
you
have
changed
so
much
during
my
absence
and
so
little
to
your
advantage
that
something
has
to
be
done
for
your
education
it
is
high
time
i
shall
take
you
to
a
boarding
school
in
town
where
you
can
be
with
many
other
children
and
young
girls
you
will
have
the
chance
to
learn
many
things
from
them
and
to
make
friends
with
many
you
will
be
sure
to
change
there
then
you
can
return
to
bring
your
father
joy
i
can
not
enjoy
you
now
for
i
do
not
know
what
ails
you
it
may
be
better
after
you
get
some
education
i
expect
to
take
you
away
next
week
cornelli
face
became
snow
white
from
sudden
terror
first
she
uttered
no
sound
but
soon
she
burst
into
violent
tears
oh
papa
she
sobbed
leave
me
at
home
i
be
good
oh
send
me
to
town
to
so
many
children
oh
i
ca
i
ca
oh
papa
do
send
me
away
hellmut
could
not
bear
to
see
cornelli
tears
and
still
less
to
hear
her
supplications
but
for
her
own
good
it
has
to
be
he
said
to
himself
to
strengthen
his
resolution
cornelli
lamentations
were
too
much
for
him
and
he
rushed
away
several
hours
later
the
time
had
come
for
supper
and
he
returned
from
the
iron
foundry
esther
came
to
meet
him
oh
i
am
glad
that
you
have
come
director
she
said
excitedly
when
i
went
up
to
cornelli
just
now
she
was
crying
i
wanted
her
to
taste
some
of
the
little
plum
cakes
she
usually
likes
so
much
but
the
poor
child
only
shrieked
leave
me
here
leave
me
here
oh
hellmut
what
if
cornelli
should
get
sick
and
die
nonsense
esther
he
returned
children
do
not
die
from
obstinacy
the
master
of
the
house
had
tried
to
speak
harshly
but
he
did
not
quite
succeed
he
ran
straight
upstairs
to
cornelli
room
and
saw
the
child
on
her
knees
in
front
of
the
bed
her
head
was
pressed
into
the
pillows
and
she
cried
as
if
her
heart
was
breaking
oh
do
send
me
away
do
send
me
away
she
cried
as
soon
as
he
entered
he
saw
that
cornelli
was
trembling
all
over
from
fear
and
excitement
i
can
not
endure
this
he
said
to
himself
and
seizing
his
hat
ran
out
of
the
house
martha
was
sitting
in
her
peaceful
little
chamber
busy
with
her
mending
and
thinking
about
cornelli
she
was
wondering
what
would
happen
now
that
she
was
again
left
alone
with
her
father
she
wondered
if
the
old
days
would
come
back
or
if
something
new
was
going
to
be
done
for
cornelli
education
the
door
was
suddenly
flung
open
and
hellmut
entered
oh
martha
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
he
said
to
her
in
a
perturbed
manner
you
simply
have
to
help
me
you
knew
my
wife
and
you
know
my
child
and
love
her
and
besides
she
is
attached
to
you
tell
me
what
has
come
over
her
since
when
has
she
been
so
frightfully
stubborn
was
the
child
always
that
way
or
has
she
only
grown
more
stubborn
lately
have
you
noticed
how
she
has
changed
in
my
absence
there
is
nothing
so
very
much
the
matter
with
cornelli
hellmut
cornelli
is
not
an
child
i
am
sure
of
that
but
wo
you
take
a
seat
director
martha
interrupted
her
speech
placing
a
chair
now
here
and
now
there
for
her
visitor
who
was
running
excitedly
to
and
fro
but
he
refused
for
he
was
too
restless
to
settle
down
it
was
really
a
very
abrupt
and
sudden
change
for
the
child
and
it
was
hard
for
her
to
have
everything
so
different
all
at
once
martha
said
even
an
older
child
might
have
become
shy
under
those
conditions
and
cornelli
is
still
very
young
it
is
hard
for
a
small
plant
to
have
too
much
done
for
it
all
at
once
and
too
suddenly
it
has
to
have
time
to
develop
and
the
better
the
plant
the
more
carefully
it
should
be
tended
i
hope
you
are
not
trying
to
insinuate
that
it
was
not
good
for
cornelli
to
at
last
get
into
the
right
hands
said
hellmut
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
room
i
have
to
reckon
it
as
a
great
blessing
that
she
was
thrown
with
ladies
of
culture
and
refinement
who
could
awaken
in
her
everything
that
was
good
noble
and
fine
and
could
teach
her
many
things
my
cornelia
would
have
done
this
herself
above
all
others
for
she
was
in
all
those
things
the
most
striking
example
the
child
has
not
a
trace
of
her
not
even
in
her
looks
everything
is
lost
that
used
to
remind
me
of
her
oh
hellmut
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
say
anything
else
i
would
only
add
one
word
martha
replied
calmly
i
have
always
found
that
a
little
love
goes
further
than
many
good
rules
i
know
that
a
young
child
can
be
frightened
by
harsh
words
more
than
people
realize
afterwards
they
can
not
understand
the
cause
of
the
shy
behavior
which
is
the
result
cornelli
has
not
lost
her
mother
eyes
only
one
can
not
see
them
under
her
hanging
fringes
yes
that
it
martha
this
horrible
disfigurement
this
obstinacy
which
holds
fast
to
it
all
the
shy
spiritless
manner
the
absolutely
changed
ways
of
the
child
hurt
and
worry
me
so
it
takes
away
all
my
joy
and
all
my
courage
and
paralyzes
all
hope
for
the
future
it
has
absolutely
spoiled
my
life
the
visitor
had
gotten
more
and
more
stirred
up
as
he
went
on
so
i
shall
help
her
in
the
only
way
i
know
of
i
shall
send
her
to
a
boarding
school
i
just
told
her
about
it
and
she
acted
as
if
she
were
absolutely
desperate
i
simply
can
not
look
upon
her
terrible
despair
i
actually
feel
as
if
my
cornelia
could
have
no
peace
in
heaven
if
she
heard
her
child
supplications
oh
director
if
you
could
only
keep
cornelli
at
home
for
a
little
while
so
that
she
could
calm
down
martha
said
humbly
cornelli
has
had
to
go
through
so
many
new
experiences
lately
that
it
would
be
good
for
her
to
stay
quietly
at
home
for
a
while
in
the
meantime
you
could
get
her
more
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
leaving
home
so
that
it
would
not
scare
her
so
dreadfully
i
promise
to
do
all
i
can
too
hellmut
i
will
tell
her
pleasant
things
about
the
school
and
the
nice
children
that
she
might
meet
there
that
is
a
fine
idea
martha
hellmut
said
a
little
more
calmly
please
do
all
you
possibly
can
to
make
the
idea
pleasant
and
desirable
to
the
child
do
not
forget
martha
that
you
are
my
only
help
after
these
words
hellmut
went
away
oh
the
good
kind
director
said
martha
following
him
with
her
eyes
what
help
can
old
stupid
martha
be
to
him
i
wonder
but
i
shall
certainly
do
whatever
i
can
arrived
at
home
hellmut
went
straight
up
to
cornelli
room
she
was
still
kneeling
at
her
bed
in
the
same
attitude
and
still
crying
bitterly
get
up
cornelli
and
stop
crying
he
said
i
meant
well
with
you
but
you
did
not
understand
me
you
shall
stay
at
home
for
the
present
later
on
you
may
feel
differently
about
it
you
can
go
to
martha
listen
well
to
her
words
for
she
is
your
best
friend
cornelli
could
not
have
heard
a
more
consoling
word
it
sounded
so
hopeful
after
all
the
horrible
news
about
going
away
ca
i
go
to
martha
right
away
she
said
longingly
yes
you
can
cornelli
replied
her
father
but
you
have
not
eaten
anything
yet
that
does
not
matter
said
cornelli
already
running
down
the
stairs
at
last
cornelli
was
running
again
she
flew
quickly
up
the
little
stairs
and
into
martha
room
i
have
to
go
away
martha
but
not
right
away
papa
says
that
i
have
to
go
the
child
called
out
on
entering
papa
told
me
to
come
to
you
i
think
it
was
because
i
cried
all
the
time
and
he
wanted
me
to
stop
but
i
wo
stop
unless
you
promise
to
help
me
to
stay
at
home
i
do
not
want
to
go
to
all
the
strange
children
i
could
stand
it
oh
no
i
could
oh
it
would
be
dreadful
please
help
me
martha
help
me
the
terrible
fear
in
cornelli
voice
and
the
sight
of
her
swollen
eyes
went
straight
to
martha
heart
come
and
sit
down
on
your
little
stool
the
way
you
used
to
in
the
old
times
cornelli
she
said
lovingly
and
i
tell
you
something
that
will
help
and
console
you
it
has
helped
me
too
and
still
does
when
trouble
comes
you
see
cornelli
i
once
had
to
go
through
a
terrible
sorrow
just
as
great
as
yours
is
i
had
to
give
a
child
i
loved
back
to
god
so
i
cried
as
loudly
as
you
are
crying
and
even
louder
i
ca
do
it
i
ca
the
more
i
fought
against
it
the
more
terrible
i
felt
till
in
the
end
i
even
thought
i
should
despair
so
i
cried
out
in
my
heart
nobody
help
me
and
then
i
suddenly
knew
who
could
do
it
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
to
god
give
me
help
for
thou
alone
canst
do
it
can
i
stay
here
if
i
pray
like
that
martha
will
god
help
me
right
away
asked
cornelli
eagerly
yes
he
will
surely
help
you
the
way
he
knows
is
best
for
you
cornelli
if
it
should
be
good
for
you
to
go
away
and
you
ask
your
father
in
heaven
for
help
he
will
bless
your
life
away
from
home
so
that
it
wo
be
as
hard
as
you
have
feared
if
you
pray
to
him
you
will
get
the
firm
assurance
that
nothing
will
be
hard
for
you
because
you
have
his
help
in
everything
you
do
god
is
sure
to
ordain
everything
in
such
a
wise
way
that
happiness
will
come
to
you
in
the
end
did
you
have
to
give
him
your
child
after
all
cornelli
wanted
to
know
yes
god
took
it
to
himself
martha
answered
and
could
you
get
happy
again
martha
yes
yes
the
pain
was
very
great
but
i
was
consoled
by
the
thought
of
my
child
peace
i
knew
how
many
ills
he
had
been
spared
god
gave
me
the
assurance
that
he
meant
well
with
both
of
us
with
that
thought
i
could
grow
happy
again
i
want
to
go
home
now
said
cornelli
suddenly
getting
up
it
seemed
as
if
something
were
drawing
her
away
yes
go
now
child
and
think
of
what
i
told
you
said
martha
accompanying
her
yes
i
will
said
cornelli
she
ran
home
quickly
because
the
desire
to
get
to
her
room
was
urging
her
on
cornelli
had
never
prayed
so
earnestly
and
heartily
as
she
did
that
day
kneeling
beside
her
bed
she
confided
all
her
sorrow
to
her
father
in
heaven
and
begged
him
to
make
her
happy
once
more
chapter
viii
a
mother
when
hellmut
sat
down
to
his
coffee
in
the
morning
he
always
found
letters
and
newspapers
on
the
breakfast
table
good
gracious
he
exclaimed
on
the
morning
after
the
departure
what
correspondents
have
you
in
town
cornelli
here
is
a
letter
for
you
cornelli
looking
up
from
her
cup
glanced
incredulously
at
the
letter
it
is
really
for
you
listen
miss
cornelli
hellmut
iron
foundry
the
father
read
here
it
is
cornelli
opened
the
letter
under
great
suspense
and
read
dear
cornelli
only
think
i
am
ill
and
have
to
lie
in
bed
the
doctor
has
forbidden
me
to
read
and
write
so
this
letter
will
be
very
short
it
is
very
tiresome
to
be
sick
for
my
sisters
are
in
school
all
day
mama
always
has
a
lot
to
attend
to
and
mux
is
still
a
very
useless
little
fellow
could
you
not
come
here
and
pay
me
a
little
visit
i
should
love
to
see
you
and
should
enjoy
hearing
all
about
you
could
tell
me
all
about
good
old
martha
whom
i
love
nearly
as
much
as
a
grandmother
about
your
little
kid
and
matthew
the
horses
and
everything
else
and
especially
about
yourself
i
always
had
such
a
good
time
with
you
that
i
should
be
terribly
pleased
if
you
came
to
visit
me
please
come
very
very
soon
your
faithful
friend
dino
when
cornelli
was
folding
up
the
letter
again
her
father
said
can
i
read
it
too
cornelli
promptly
handed
him
her
letter
what
friend
is
this
that
wants
you
to
come
to
visit
him
the
father
asked
with
astonishment
i
expect
you
to
cry
immediately
though
for
you
might
have
to
go
to
town
oh
no
papa
i
really
would
love
to
see
him
said
cornelli
it
is
dino
who
stayed
with
martha
this
summer
the
father
put
down
his
spoon
from
pure
surprise
and
looked
wonderingly
at
his
daughter
how
strange
you
are
cornelli
he
said
finally
now
you
suddenly
want
to
visit
a
strange
family
you
only
know
this
boy
and
you
do
not
hesitate
about
it
and
are
not
even
shy
about
appearing
in
your
present
condition
dino
knows
me
well
and
knows
that
i
would
come
to
see
him
alone
he
will
arrange
everything
for
me
so
that
i
wo
have
to
see
his
mother
or
his
sisters
he
knows
everything
was
cornelli
explanation
that
has
no
sense
at
all
the
father
said
curtly
and
gathering
up
his
papers
he
went
away
soon
afterwards
he
entered
martha
little
house
here
i
am
again
i
wonder
what
you
will
say
to
me
he
called
to
the
surprised
old
woman
here
is
a
letter
with
an
invitation
which
came
for
cornelli
it
is
from
a
boy
who
stayed
with
you
who
is
he
who
are
his
parents
this
question
made
martha
fairly
overflow
with
praises
of
the
boy
she
told
hellmut
that
she
had
never
known
a
boy
who
was
so
polite
and
friendly
to
simple
folks
as
this
boy
had
been
he
had
been
well
brought
up
had
the
most
refined
and
charming
manners
and
was
well
educated
and
at
the
same
time
so
simple
and
childishly
devoted
to
old
plain
martha
she
had
never
read
letters
like
the
mother
letter
to
her
son
so
beautiful
affectionate
and
elevating
he
had
always
read
them
to
her
and
she
had
had
to
cry
every
time
from
sheer
emotion
she
had
never
before
seen
as
beautiful
linen
as
the
boy
had
worn
and
it
had
all
been
his
two
sisters
work
martha
the
director
finally
interrupted
her
according
to
your
account
it
would
be
a
great
blessing
for
my
daughter
to
spend
even
a
day
in
such
a
family
if
you
would
really
take
her
there
director
i
certainly
would
be
happy
ah
i
would
not
know
a
greater
happiness
martha
had
to
wipe
her
eyes
she
was
so
stirred
you
shall
know
it
martha
we
go
tomorrow
and
on
the
same
evening
you
shall
hear
an
account
of
all
that
happened
with
these
words
the
director
seized
her
hand
and
after
shaking
it
heartily
departed
get
everything
ready
cornelli
we
are
going
to
town
he
called
to
his
daughter
who
sat
on
the
garden
bench
quietly
thinking
esther
shall
call
you
early
at
six
indeed
i
shall
came
esther
voice
through
some
open
window
she
was
a
good
sentinel
for
she
always
seemed
to
know
what
was
going
on
in
the
house
and
its
immediate
neighborhood
early
next
morning
the
two
shiny
brown
horses
were
trotting
down
the
valley
they
had
to
go
for
four
full
hours
but
that
seemed
a
pure
pleasure
to
them
the
longer
they
ran
the
more
spirit
they
seemed
to
get
and
matthew
had
to
keep
them
from
galloping
all
the
time
in
her
corner
cornelli
meditated
as
to
how
she
could
tell
the
maid
at
her
arrival
that
she
wanted
to
visit
no
one
but
dino
and
wanted
to
be
taken
straight
to
his
room
she
planned
also
to
forbid
dino
to
call
his
sisters
and
his
mother
for
she
wanted
to
see
him
alone
she
would
pay
dino
a
long
visit
and
then
steal
quietly
away
without
being
noticed
she
was
also
reflecting
about
everything
she
wanted
to
tell
her
friend
first
of
all
she
had
to
tell
him
that
the
news
had
at
last
come
out
regarding
who
had
been
standing
on
the
sofa
she
had
told
him
all
about
this
deep
grief
she
had
borne
for
so
long
so
they
came
to
town
much
sooner
than
cornelli
had
ever
thought
possible
the
carriage
was
already
halting
before
the
hotel
where
her
father
usually
stopped
and
cornelli
jumped
down
shall
i
come
back
again
in
four
hours
papa
she
asked
i
can
find
my
way
alone
for
dino
has
described
it
to
me
stop
stop
that
is
not
the
way
i
am
coming
too
the
father
said
cornelli
was
quite
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
start
off
alone
for
that
had
been
her
plan
now
everything
was
quite
different
as
dino
had
written
his
exact
address
in
his
letter
and
the
director
knew
his
way
about
town
very
well
they
passed
quickly
from
street
to
street
till
they
reached
a
narrow
little
lane
here
stood
the
house
they
had
been
seeking
when
finally
four
high
stairs
had
been
climbed
the
director
stood
on
the
highest
narrow
step
where
the
door
took
up
half
of
the
standing
room
if
the
inhabitants
correspond
to
their
dwelling
place
we
shall
probably
not
remain
here
very
long
he
said
looking
up
doubtfully
at
the
inconvenient
entrance
dino
does
not
correspond
said
cornelli
quickly
she
had
not
quite
understood
her
father
words
but
felt
them
to
be
an
attack
on
her
friend
climb
up
there
cornelli
and
pull
the
he
commanded
when
the
door
is
open
i
probably
find
room
to
stand
there
too
cornelli
obeyed
a
slender
girl
a
good
deal
taller
than
cornelli
opened
the
door
and
looked
with
surprise
at
the
new
arrivals
through
a
pair
of
dark
and
serious
eyes
cornelli
retreated
suddenly
well
what
i
see
is
not
very
dreadful
the
director
said
stepping
forward
how
do
you
do
child
is
your
mother
at
home
and
can
i
speak
to
her
a
moment
the
girl
who
had
opened
the
door
was
nika
with
great
politeness
she
led
the
gentleman
to
a
room
and
informed
him
that
she
would
go
at
once
to
fetch
her
mother
who
was
with
her
sick
brother
upon
her
polite
invitation
the
director
followed
her
and
settled
down
in
an
he
looked
about
him
with
astonishment
at
the
small
but
scrupulously
neat
room
which
was
decorated
with
several
charming
pictures
when
nika
neared
the
door
cornelli
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
i
want
to
visit
dino
come
i
show
you
the
way
came
a
small
voice
from
behind
the
door
it
was
mux
who
had
quickly
hidden
there
to
peep
with
curious
eyes
at
the
new
arrivals
he
came
out
and
seizing
cornelli
hand
pulled
her
away
with
him
the
mother
had
heard
the
stranger
voice
and
at
this
moment
entered
from
an
adjoining
chamber
she
does
not
correspond
either
as
cornelli
puts
it
the
director
said
to
himself
with
a
smile
he
rose
and
introduced
himself
following
your
son
summons
halm
i
have
brought
you
my
daughter
he
said
she
can
stay
a
few
hours
with
her
sick
friend
if
that
suits
you
and
then
she
can
join
me
again
at
my
hotel
i
am
so
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
great
favor
of
bringing
her
my
son
has
looked
forward
so
much
to
this
visit
we
all
know
and
love
cornelli
already
from
what
he
has
told
us
about
her
she
has
been
so
kind
to
him
and
has
entertained
him
so
well
when
he
was
alone
in
that
she
has
earned
his
and
my
sincere
thanks
could
i
not
beg
of
you
to
leave
cornelli
here
for
a
few
days
or
at
least
for
all
of
you
are
very
kind
halm
he
replied
quite
astonished
to
hear
that
his
shy
unfriendly
child
should
have
furnished
the
boy
any
entertainment
those
are
just
polite
words
he
said
to
himself
but
aloud
he
added
i
am
afraid
that
it
wo
be
possible
for
my
child
would
not
stay
she
is
very
shy
and
has
all
kinds
of
peculiar
habits
as
you
probably
have
noticed
from
her
looks
your
daughter
certainly
looks
different
i
shall
not
keep
cornelli
here
against
her
will
of
course
but
may
i
hope
to
have
your
permission
if
the
child
should
want
to
stay
the
rector
widow
had
such
a
pleasing
manner
that
it
was
hard
to
refuse
her
anything
the
director
therefore
gladly
assented
for
it
was
his
wish
as
well
as
hers
certainly
halm
i
shall
joyfully
give
it
he
assured
her
what
could
please
me
more
than
to
have
my
daughter
in
surroundings
like
these
but
i
am
perfectly
certain
that
cornelli
will
desire
to
go
back
with
me
just
the
same
i
want
to
thank
you
sincerely
for
your
great
kindness
it
will
help
her
to
spend
even
a
single
day
in
your
charming
household
the
director
said
farewell
and
departed
at
the
entrance
door
down
stairs
a
school
girl
carrying
her
schoolbag
and
books
ran
towards
him
so
violently
that
a
collision
could
not
be
avoided
so
the
director
opened
his
arms
wide
and
caught
agnes
in
them
agnes
always
approached
everything
like
a
wind
storm
she
could
not
behave
otherwise
the
director
laughed
heartily
and
so
did
agnes
i
am
sure
you
belong
to
halm
too
he
said
looking
with
pleasure
at
the
lively
face
with
the
bright
eyes
how
nice
and
trim
everything
was
about
her
yes
indeed
she
replied
quickly
and
ran
away
what
a
happy
mother
what
a
happy
woman
said
the
director
to
himself
and
to
compare
my
child
to
such
children
i
can
not
bear
it
such
children
and
mine
beside
them
dino
had
told
his
mother
about
his
experiences
in
and
especially
of
his
acquaintance
with
cornelli
he
had
also
related
to
her
the
child
strange
trouble
but
she
had
had
to
give
her
promise
to
keep
it
to
herself
it
did
not
seem
wrong
to
dino
to
tell
his
mother
because
she
always
knew
everything
he
knew
when
the
invitation
had
been
sent
to
cornelli
halm
had
seriously
told
the
children
not
to
make
any
remarks
about
cornelli
hair
in
case
she
should
come
she
had
told
them
not
to
show
any
surprise
if
cornelli
wore
her
hair
in
a
rather
strange
fashion
and
not
to
notice
it
further
that
was
the
way
the
mother
wished
it
to
be
little
mux
was
very
much
pleased
at
having
a
new
companion
he
looked
upon
her
as
an
old
acquaintance
for
dino
had
talked
so
much
about
her
first
he
took
her
to
see
the
kitchen
but
i
am
sure
dino
does
not
sleep
here
said
cornelli
surprised
no
this
is
the
kitchen
there
are
no
beds
here
mux
asserted
but
i
shall
show
you
first
why
agnes
cried
one
whole
hour
or
perhaps
it
was
two
and
mux
led
his
new
friend
to
a
whole
pile
of
apple
peels
which
lay
in
a
bucket
is
agnes
stupid
to
cry
when
we
get
good
apple
tarts
afterwards
but
why
did
she
cry
asked
cornelli
full
of
sympathy
she
knew
exactly
what
it
was
like
when
one
simply
had
to
cry
we
do
know
retorted
mux
but
why
does
the
maid
not
peel
the
apples
asked
cornelli
again
there
is
no
maid
except
trina
mux
informed
her
who
is
trina
cornelli
wanted
to
know
she
has
to
help
she
is
small
and
fat
mux
described
her
mama
has
to
show
her
how
to
cook
and
she
has
to
fetch
what
we
need
and
always
brings
the
wrong
thing
so
dino
says
really
must
send
trina
away
and
then
mama
says
has
to
live
too
and
then
she
is
not
sent
away
after
all
cornelli
had
great
sympathy
for
agnes
who
apparently
had
a
secret
trouble
like
her
own
she
did
not
have
to
be
afraid
of
her
as
she
was
of
the
proud
sister
who
had
received
her
i
am
sure
mux
that
your
other
sister
never
cries
are
you
not
afraid
of
her
asked
cornelli
not
the
least
little
bit
replied
the
little
boy
she
often
makes
a
face
though
as
if
she
wanted
to
cry
and
a
thousand
thousand
times
she
begins
to
when
nobody
knows
why
i
do
know
why
either
for
she
does
tell
me
immediately
cornelli
great
shyness
of
nika
changed
into
great
pity
if
nika
could
not
even
talk
about
her
sorrow
she
might
have
the
deepest
sorrow
of
all
now
we
shall
go
to
dino
she
said
hurrying
to
the
door
which
the
little
boy
had
pointed
out
to
her
but
wait
i
shall
first
show
you
our
big
picture
book
you
love
it
mux
assured
her
there
is
something
in
it
that
looks
just
like
you
it
is
an
owl
that
has
rags
over
its
eyes
like
you
but
you
must
not
talk
about
it
because
mama
has
forbidden
it
no
no
i
do
want
to
see
the
book
please
take
me
to
dino
now
cornelli
urged
mux
pulled
cornelli
away
from
the
kitchen
at
last
and
not
far
from
there
opened
a
door
are
you
coming
at
last
cornelli
dino
cried
to
her
he
was
sitting
up
in
bed
he
glanced
happily
at
his
approaching
friend
and
cornelli
too
felt
deep
joy
at
seeing
him
again
the
hours
she
had
spent
with
him
had
been
the
only
happy
ones
she
had
had
all
summer
quickly
sitting
down
by
his
bed
she
began
to
relate
to
him
everything
that
had
happened
in
since
his
departure
dino
asked
many
questions
that
cornelli
had
to
answer
and
the
time
went
by
they
knew
not
how
mux
had
disappeared
as
long
as
he
could
not
have
his
new
whole
attention
he
preferred
to
find
out
what
was
being
prepared
for
dinner
in
the
kitchen
now
the
mother
entered
the
room
i
have
hardly
seen
you
yet
dear
child
she
said
taking
hand
but
i
thought
i
would
leave
you
and
dino
undisturbed
for
a
little
while
you
must
have
many
things
to
talk
over
about
your
experiences
and
friends
in
dino
has
looked
forward
so
much
to
your
visit
please
come
to
lunch
now
dino
has
to
sleep
a
little
while
afterwards
and
then
you
can
go
back
to
him
again
if
you
wish
a
difficult
moment
had
now
come
for
cornelli
she
had
secretly
hoped
that
she
would
be
able
to
spend
all
day
alone
with
dino
and
that
nobody
else
would
notice
her
now
she
had
to
sit
at
table
with
mother
and
sisters
mux
however
was
her
consolation
he
seemed
so
confiding
and
so
friendly
she
had
felt
immediately
to
her
great
discomfort
how
different
and
how
horrible
she
looked
in
comparison
with
these
charming
children
when
she
had
stood
in
front
of
nika
who
was
so
very
pretty
she
felt
sure
that
the
elder
girl
must
be
filled
with
disgust
at
the
sight
of
her
even
if
she
did
not
show
it
mux
had
seen
her
peculiarity
immediately
and
had
remarked
upon
it
and
now
agnes
would
be
there
too
that
agnes
as
well
as
the
nika
had
a
secret
sorrow
made
cornelli
feel
as
if
there
were
a
bond
between
them
this
gave
her
a
little
courage
to
follow
dino
mother
who
was
waiting
in
the
doorway
when
cornelli
entered
agnes
was
standing
full
of
expectation
in
the
middle
of
the
room
going
up
to
the
visitor
she
shook
her
hand
i
am
so
glad
you
came
cornelli
she
said
with
animation
dino
has
talked
so
much
about
you
that
we
too
wanted
to
meet
you
i
want
to
sit
beside
you
said
mux
dragging
his
chair
to
side
just
stay
where
you
are
that
is
my
seat
agnes
cut
him
short
she
could
not
be
misunderstood
for
she
pushed
back
the
chair
and
mux
quite
vigorously
the
mother
had
again
gone
out
to
the
kitchen
so
he
could
not
get
her
help
which
made
him
very
angry
yes
yes
you
always
want
to
order
everybody
around
all
the
time
he
cried
out
furiously
and
you
even
broke
somebody
on
the
wheel
once
now
the
mother
entered
oh
mama
mux
is
saying
such
frightful
things
should
he
go
to
bed
agnes
called
to
her
mux
was
just
gathering
up
his
strength
to
fight
against
this
proposed
punishment
when
the
mother
cut
short
their
quarrel
no
no
she
said
kindly
cornelli
is
here
for
the
first
time
and
it
is
a
feast
day
for
us
mux
shall
not
go
to
bed
but
he
must
sit
down
quietly
in
his
chair
and
say
grace
then
all
will
be
well
mux
was
soon
calmed
by
the
soothing
words
and
the
good
soup
delicious
odor
which
penetrated
his
nostrils
so
he
said
grace
in
quite
a
tolerable
manner
cornelli
had
been
very
much
touched
by
his
desire
to
sit
beside
her
she
was
anxious
to
do
him
a
favor
too
and
she
tried
to
think
of
something
that
might
please
him
directly
after
lunch
nika
and
agnes
had
to
hurry
off
to
school
again
and
the
mother
had
to
supervise
trina
work
so
mux
was
entrusted
with
the
task
of
entertaining
cornelli
for
a
little
while
that
suited
him
exactly
now
i
show
you
that
agnes
has
really
broken
a
man
on
the
wheel
he
said
triumphantly
but
i
do
believe
it
mux
and
why
should
the
man
have
held
still
asked
cornelli
you
can
read
it
here
see
it
is
written
there
said
mux
placing
his
picture
book
on
cornelli
lap
and
pointing
to
a
splendid
colored
picture
read
what
is
written
here
he
directed
dino
once
read
it
aloud
to
me
and
then
i
knew
it
cornelli
read
aloud
agnes
orders
rudolph
von
warth
to
be
bound
to
the
wheel
now
you
see
it
mux
said
complacently
cornelli
did
not
quite
know
what
the
picture
was
supposed
to
mean
so
she
began
to
read
the
story
that
explained
it
she
read
more
eagerly
each
instant
for
it
was
described
so
vividly
that
she
had
to
consume
one
page
after
another
now
you
know
it
said
mux
a
little
impatiently
now
look
at
the
goat
wagon
but
mux
cornelli
said
eagerly
it
is
quite
a
different
agnes
it
is
a
queen
you
must
never
think
any
more
that
your
sister
has
done
such
a
dreadful
thing
oh
but
look
at
the
goat
wagon
now
begged
mux
a
little
disappointed
why
is
the
child
here
crying
on
the
road
just
look
how
he
is
pressing
his
hands
up
to
his
eyes
oh
he
is
so
unhappy
do
you
know
why
mux
shook
his
head
then
i
have
to
read
it
quickly
said
cornelli
she
became
so
absorbed
in
the
story
that
she
did
not
notice
how
mux
was
pulling
her
and
urging
her
to
stop
reading
he
even
shook
the
book
the
mother
came
into
the
room
now
and
said
dino
has
shortened
his
rest
a
little
for
he
is
longing
to
see
you
again
cornelli
will
you
come
cornelli
immediately
shut
the
book
for
she
was
extremely
glad
to
go
to
her
friend
she
felt
some
regret
however
at
having
to
leave
the
story
unfinished
she
would
have
loved
to
know
what
happened
further
so
you
like
the
book
it
was
the
joy
of
all
my
children
from
the
oldest
to
the
youngest
said
the
mother
cornelli
regretful
glance
at
it
had
not
escaped
her
you
can
look
at
it
again
later
on
for
we
still
have
lots
of
time
but
cornelli
had
to
talk
over
so
many
things
with
dino
that
the
time
had
passed
before
they
had
thought
it
possible
and
it
was
not
long
before
mux
came
running
with
the
message
that
supper
was
ready
the
meal
had
to
be
early
because
cornelli
had
to
leave
immediately
after
it
oh
what
a
shame
said
cornelli
jumping
up
because
she
knew
her
father
did
not
like
to
wait
bring
mother
here
mux
said
dino
and
the
little
one
departed
would
you
like
to
stay
with
us
a
few
days
cornelli
it
would
be
so
nice
would
you
like
to
oh
i
think
you
would
said
dino
eagerly
cornelli
had
quite
a
strange
sensation
she
hardly
dared
to
say
yes
it
seemed
so
incredible
to
her
that
everybody
in
the
house
should
be
so
friendly
to
her
and
really
want
her
to
stay
but
that
probably
would
not
last
if
she
remained
and
they
got
to
know
her
better
soon
the
mother
came
in
with
mux
the
little
boy
had
heard
dino
last
words
to
cornelli
and
had
already
announced
to
his
mother
that
cornelli
was
sure
to
stay
because
dino
would
not
let
her
go
oh
i
am
so
glad
that
you
have
settled
it
all
between
you
i
am
so
pleased
that
you
are
going
to
stay
cornelli
she
said
full
of
joy
i
was
just
going
to
propose
it
to
you
and
i
am
so
glad
that
dino
has
persuaded
you
your
father
has
already
given
me
his
permission
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
let
him
know
right
away
now
you
can
stay
quietly
together
for
there
is
no
hurry
about
supper
the
mother
immediately
wrote
to
hellmut
and
soon
after
that
fat
little
trina
was
running
over
to
the
hotel
cornelli
had
again
settled
down
beside
dino
with
a
mixed
feeling
of
wonderful
delight
and
fear
he
noticed
her
timidity
oh
yes
dino
i
love
to
stay
with
you
and
mux
she
assured
him
your
mother
is
so
good
to
me
too
but
i
am
afraid
of
your
two
sisters
i
have
to
think
of
poor
little
trina
all
the
time
when
she
does
everything
wrong
and
does
not
know
how
to
do
otherwise
you
all
despise
her
for
it
and
she
ca
help
it
i
know
what
it
is
like
to
be
so
dino
had
to
laugh
a
little
why
do
you
suddenly
think
of
our
trina
he
asked
do
not
worry
about
her
for
mother
is
very
good
to
her
just
be
happy
cornelli
and
do
not
imagine
all
kinds
of
things
about
trina
cornelli
did
not
say
another
word
but
dino
noticed
that
she
kept
on
thinking
just
the
same
after
a
while
the
mother
came
to
announce
that
it
was
time
for
dino
rest
the
prospect
of
seeing
each
other
again
on
the
following
day
was
a
great
consolation
to
them
both
then
cornelli
and
the
mother
went
back
to
the
room
where
the
sisters
were
sitting
at
their
school
work
mux
was
bending
over
his
picture
book
hatching
out
new
ideas
no
doubt
just
then
the
half
grown
trina
entered
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
while
she
was
passing
nika
chair
her
basket
got
caught
on
it
pulling
violently
to
free
it
she
turned
the
chair
around
quite
suddenly
you
are
getting
more
awkward
every
day
trina
nika
said
crossly
cornelli
blushed
she
felt
as
if
these
words
were
meant
for
her
as
well
she
must
be
just
as
awkward
in
nika
eyes
as
trina
was
the
latter
failed
to
excuse
herself
and
from
embarrassment
became
more
clumsy
in
her
movements
cornelli
understood
this
perfectly
that
was
what
she
always
did
she
knew
it
quite
well
now
we
shall
have
supper
said
the
mother
and
when
the
work
is
done
we
shall
all
sing
together
do
you
sing
too
cornelli
i
probably
do
not
know
the
songs
and
so
i
ca
sing
she
replied
shyly
after
supper
mux
fled
back
to
cornelli
with
his
book
he
wanted
to
renew
his
conversation
with
her
but
his
mother
had
a
different
plan
give
your
book
to
cornelli
for
it
is
time
for
you
to
retire
she
said
you
can
join
us
again
mux
departed
reluctantly
when
his
mother
was
firmly
leading
him
away
he
was
still
able
to
call
to
cornelli
be
sure
not
to
go
till
i
come
back
cornelli
felt
quite
frightened
when
her
confiding
little
friend
had
gone
now
for
the
first
time
she
was
left
alone
with
the
two
sisters
she
wondered
what
would
happen
but
nothing
happened
they
were
both
so
deeply
occupied
with
their
work
that
they
did
not
even
raise
their
heads
cornelli
now
remembered
the
lovely
story
book
she
had
already
begun
a
story
and
she
simply
had
to
know
how
it
would
end
so
she
began
to
read
as
soon
as
she
finished
one
story
a
new
wonderful
picture
would
lead
her
to
another
story
suddenly
some
splendid
music
sounded
close
beside
her
and
cornelli
started
agnes
was
sitting
at
the
piano
close
to
her
side
and
playing
cornelli
could
not
read
any
more
for
agnes
played
one
lovely
tune
after
another
as
quickly
and
easily
as
if
it
did
not
cause
her
any
trouble
she
knew
from
dino
that
agnes
was
not
much
more
than
a
year
older
than
she
was
she
listened
with
admiration
to
the
beautiful
melodies
that
were
pouring
forth
from
the
instrument
finally
the
mother
returned
she
had
made
her
nightly
visit
to
dino
and
had
had
several
things
to
say
to
him
mama
agnes
called
to
her
eagerly
i
am
playing
all
the
merry
pieces
i
know
for
i
have
just
finished
my
long
composition
you
are
right
agnes
and
how
are
you
getting
along
with
your
painting
nika
asked
the
mother
nika
replied
quite
sadly
that
she
had
hoped
to
finish
it
that
day
but
the
days
were
very
short
now
and
she
could
not
paint
by
lamp
light
her
mother
should
see
how
little
her
work
still
lacked
if
i
had
one
hour
more
of
daylight
i
could
finish
it
she
sighed
nika
placed
a
large
painting
under
the
bright
lamp
it
somewhat
resembled
the
beautiful
pictures
which
decorated
the
walls
of
the
room
the
colors
in
it
were
perfectly
wonderful
and
cornelli
had
never
before
seen
such
a
lovely
picture
sparkling
crimson
roses
were
hanging
down
an
old
wall
and
dense
ivy
was
creeping
up
between
them
with
shiny
green
leaves
an
old
oak
tree
was
stretching
large
gnarled
branches
over
the
decayed
wall
and
below
a
clear
stream
was
peacefully
flowing
out
to
a
meadow
where
glowing
red
and
blue
flowers
seemed
to
greet
it
joyfully
cornelli
stared
at
the
lovely
picture
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
glittering
stream
the
painted
trees
and
flowers
one
seemed
to
hear
the
murmuring
of
the
brook
far
far
away
through
the
meadow
it
was
all
so
full
of
life
and
to
think
that
nika
had
painted
it
cornelli
felt
as
if
a
deep
deep
gulf
lay
between
her
and
the
two
sisters
a
chasm
that
separated
her
from
them
forever
the
two
sisters
seemed
to
stand
before
her
like
two
splendid
creatures
full
of
beauty
and
fine
gifts
while
she
stood
there
a
stupid
awkward
trina
whom
nobody
on
earth
ever
could
possibly
love
halm
gave
nika
great
encouragement
by
praising
her
work
and
urging
her
to
begin
promptly
next
day
then
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
for
they
always
concluded
their
evening
with
a
song
cornelli
remained
still
the
rector
wife
urged
her
to
join
them
but
cornelli
had
had
too
many
impressions
that
day
to
be
able
to
sing
she
knew
quite
well
the
old
evening
song
that
they
were
singing
for
martha
had
taught
it
to
her
long
ago
but
she
felt
as
if
she
could
not
utter
a
note
at
the
end
of
the
song
agnes
suddenly
exploded
oh
mother
that
is
nothing
at
all
when
you
are
hoarse
and
dino
is
in
bed
our
singing
is
frightful
nika
only
squeaks
like
a
little
chicken
with
a
sore
throat
well
then
one
has
to
stop
singing
said
nika
shaking
her
shoulders
a
little
proudly
no
the
whole
household
has
to
sing
otherwise
it
is
not
worth
anything
agnes
declared
it
is
a
shame
that
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
should
be
so
little
practiced
after
the
song
was
ended
the
mother
took
cornelli
kindly
by
the
hand
and
said
i
am
sure
that
you
are
tired
dear
child
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
tiny
bedroom
for
i
have
no
larger
one
your
door
leads
into
agnes
and
nika
room
she
continued
when
she
was
standing
with
cornelli
in
the
little
chamber
you
can
open
the
door
and
then
you
are
practically
all
three
in
a
single
room
then
she
said
cordially
and
wished
cornelli
a
good
rest
nika
and
agnes
quickly
said
too
and
then
cornelli
was
alone
in
her
room
she
had
no
desire
to
open
the
door
for
her
shyness
had
only
increased
since
her
arrival
how
high
the
two
stood
above
her
cornelli
was
not
a
bit
sleepy
and
kept
on
thinking
of
all
the
things
that
had
happened
to
her
that
day
what
did
agnes
mean
when
she
spoke
about
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
the
world
did
she
mean
singing
that
was
not
the
most
beautiful
thing
by
any
means
the
most
wonderful
of
all
was
a
painting
like
nika
with
lovely
roses
and
trees
and
the
meadow
with
clear
water
at
last
cornelli
eyes
closed
but
she
kept
on
seeing
the
flowers
and
seemed
to
be
looking
up
admiringly
at
nika
who
stood
beside
her
tall
and
beautiful
cornelli
thought
if
she
would
only
say
one
pleasant
word
to
me
then
nika
turned
around
to
her
and
said
you
are
an
awkward
cornelli
all
this
cornelli
saw
and
heard
in
her
dream
agnes
said
to
her
sister
in
the
other
room
if
only
cornelli
would
say
something
one
can
not
tell
what
she
is
thinking
about
how
could
dino
find
her
so
amusing
and
become
her
friend
she
sits
there
all
the
time
and
never
says
a
word
that
is
her
least
fault
nika
returned
but
it
is
horrid
that
she
insists
on
looking
like
a
wild
islander
i
do
not
understand
why
mama
did
not
push
the
frightful
locks
out
of
her
eyes
chapter
ix
a
great
change
next
morning
mux
had
hardly
opened
his
eyes
when
he
desired
to
go
again
straightway
to
cornelli
for
this
had
been
promised
him
the
night
before
before
he
succeeded
however
he
had
to
submit
to
his
usual
fate
in
the
morning
he
ran
into
the
room
at
last
neatly
washed
and
combed
and
with
cheeks
shining
like
two
red
apples
cornelli
was
already
sitting
in
a
corner
of
the
room
listening
attentively
to
playing
he
flew
towards
her
and
saw
his
beloved
book
already
in
her
hands
oh
now
we
shall
read
and
tell
stories
all
day
long
he
called
out
happily
all
the
others
have
to
go
to
school
but
mux
had
forgotten
that
breakfast
came
first
of
all
after
the
meal
the
two
sisters
departed
but
dino
knocked
and
clamored
for
cornelli
to
come
to
him
mux
loudly
protested
against
this
and
only
calmed
down
when
cornelli
promised
to
keep
him
company
during
dino
rest
hour
he
kept
on
objecting
and
murmuring
to
himself
even
after
she
had
gone
cornelli
was
quite
thrilled
and
overcome
by
the
thought
that
anybody
should
love
her
so
and
it
did
her
more
good
than
anything
else
as
soon
as
she
came
to
dino
room
he
asked
her
if
she
would
read
to
him
too
for
he
had
found
out
how
much
she
enjoyed
reading
to
mux
out
of
his
picture
book
have
you
entertaining
books
too
asked
cornelli
with
hesitation
in
her
mind
she
saw
her
own
beautiful
books
at
home
that
she
had
left
alone
because
so
many
things
in
them
had
been
unintelligible
i
should
say
so
you
just
ought
to
see
them
said
dino
please
take
down
the
book
called
journeys
there
are
pictures
in
it
too
they
are
not
as
big
as
in
the
other
book
and
are
not
colored
but
they
are
so
comical
that
they
make
one
laugh
all
the
time
cornelli
got
the
book
down
and
in
a
little
while
merry
peals
of
laughter
filled
the
room
the
mother
who
heard
was
happily
smiling
and
saying
to
herself
no
no
all
is
not
yet
lost
so
the
week
passed
by
cornelli
spent
most
of
her
time
reading
aloud
to
dino
and
to
mux
she
grew
more
eager
all
the
time
in
this
occupation
and
if
mux
would
suddenly
want
to
play
with
soldiers
cornelli
would
say
you
can
easily
play
that
alone
let
me
read
this
and
later
tell
you
all
about
it
so
she
had
soon
finished
reading
the
whole
big
book
cornelli
had
so
far
scarcely
become
acquainted
with
the
two
girls
and
nika
had
rarely
spoken
to
her
on
saturday
morning
the
mother
entered
dino
room
just
after
cornelli
had
finished
reading
such
a
funny
tale
that
both
children
still
laughed
aloud
at
the
remembrance
children
cornelli
father
is
expecting
to
hear
from
me
he
will
want
to
know
if
he
is
to
come
to
fetch
her
home
or
if
he
is
to
leave
her
here
another
week
cornelli
herself
shall
decide
but
we
all
want
her
to
stay
do
go
do
go
tell
him
not
to
come
for
a
long
while
mux
implored
her
the
little
boy
had
slipped
in
behind
his
mother
and
was
keeping
a
tight
hold
on
cornelli
as
if
her
papa
might
come
at
once
to
pull
her
away
no
no
cornelli
you
wo
go
away
yet
dino
now
said
i
am
allowed
to
get
up
for
the
first
time
and
you
must
be
there
to
see
if
i
can
still
walk
after
that
you
must
stay
here
till
i
go
to
school
wo
you
cornelli
you
do
want
to
go
do
you
you
must
not
urge
her
too
much
said
the
mother
maybe
cornelli
would
rather
go
home
and
by
your
talking
you
might
keep
her
from
saying
so
but
being
urged
by
the
two
children
was
such
a
joy
to
cornelli
that
she
never
even
hesitated
i
should
love
to
stay
she
said
oh
how
splendid
dino
exclaimed
please
ask
for
at
least
two
or
three
weeks
mama
it
is
so
nice
to
have
cornelli
with
us
i
shall
ask
cornelli
father
to
let
us
have
his
daughter
a
while
longer
said
the
mother
i
can
not
possibly
settle
the
time
her
father
will
do
that
oh
yes
a
while
longer
is
just
right
then
it
is
so
easy
to
ask
for
a
little
more
time
for
we
can
say
that
we
meant
that
by
a
little
longer
said
dino
the
same
day
later
on
while
dino
was
resting
cornelli
was
sitting
with
mux
they
were
both
so
happy
over
the
prospect
of
remaining
together
that
mux
opened
the
piano
and
asked
cornelli
to
sing
with
him
cornelli
could
not
play
so
promised
that
she
would
try
to
sing
she
asked
mux
to
choose
a
song
but
he
knew
none
you
sing
one
he
proposed
and
i
might
know
it
too
cornelli
was
just
in
the
mood
to
sing
once
more
she
began
a
song
with
her
bright
full
voice
and
mux
listened
admiringly
the
snow
on
the
meadow
the
snow
all
around
the
snow
lies
in
heaps
all
over
the
ground
hurrah
oh
hurrah
all
over
the
ground
oh
cuckoo
from
the
woods
oh
flowers
so
bright
oh
kindliest
sun
come
and
bring
us
delight
hurrah
oh
hurrah
come
and
bring
us
delight
when
the
swallow
comes
back
and
the
finches
all
sing
i
sing
and
i
dance
for
joy
of
the
spring
hurrah
oh
hurrah
for
joy
of
the
spring
suddenly
the
door
flew
open
and
agnes
burst
into
the
room
but
why
did
you
ever
say
anything
she
cried
out
to
think
of
it
why
did
you
never
say
a
word
cornelli
but
what
should
i
have
said
cornelli
asked
very
much
frightened
you
must
not
be
afraid
mux
now
calmed
her
i
help
you
if
she
should
want
to
hurt
you
do
be
so
unnaturally
stupid
mux
his
sister
ejaculated
as
she
ran
to
the
next
room
here
her
mother
was
already
standing
in
the
open
door
have
you
heard
it
mother
come
out
and
let
cornelli
sing
her
song
again
yes
indeed
i
have
heard
it
with
pleasure
and
great
wonder
said
the
mother
approaching
cornelli
you
have
a
voice
dear
child
that
we
all
should
love
to
hear
again
have
you
often
sung
before
oh
yes
said
cornelli
martha
has
taught
me
many
songs
but
what
do
you
mean
by
but
agnes
quickly
interrupted
her
i
know
now
what
a
voice
you
have
i
have
to
go
quickly
to
my
music
lesson
but
you
must
sing
a
lot
with
me
no
buts
will
be
allowed
then
oh
cornelli
wo
you
sing
with
us
tonight
asked
the
mother
kindly
we
know
now
how
well
it
sounds
and
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
still
hesitate
i
ca
sing
properly
when
i
am
afraid
for
then
it
does
not
sound
well
cornelli
replied
why
should
you
be
afraid
asked
the
mother
you
know
us
all
so
well
now
oh
because
i
am
not
like
agnes
and
nika
i
ca
do
anything
they
do
and
i
do
look
the
way
they
do
said
cornelli
with
these
words
she
frowned
again
in
the
old
way
so
that
one
could
see
it
through
the
thick
fringes
of
hair
that
covered
her
forehead
the
mother
said
no
more
and
went
out
just
stay
with
me
cornelli
then
you
do
have
to
be
afraid
of
anything
mux
said
protectingly
i
am
afraid
of
nothing
in
the
whole
world
except
of
the
dark
he
added
quickly
for
he
had
seen
penetrating
eyes
looking
at
him
through
her
hair
and
felt
that
he
had
to
tell
the
truth
for
she
was
sure
to
find
him
out
no
he
continued
i
wo
be
even
afraid
of
that
if
you
stay
with
me
all
the
time
agnes
had
finished
her
school
work
sooner
than
ever
that
day
she
ran
to
the
piano
and
called
to
cornelli
come
here
mux
can
play
alone
for
we
must
sing
now
so
cornelli
went
up
to
the
piano
i
shall
sing
the
first
stanza
of
this
song
and
then
you
can
sing
it
with
me
the
second
time
agnes
said
and
began
the
beauteous
moon
is
risen
oh
i
have
known
that
song
a
long
time
shall
i
sing
the
second
voice
asked
cornelli
what
can
you
really
sing
second
voice
can
you
really
do
it
oh
that
would
be
wonderful
go
ahead
and
do
it
said
agnes
excitedly
so
the
two
girls
sang
alone
together
for
nika
had
not
finished
her
work
and
the
regular
time
for
the
evening
songs
had
not
yet
come
agnes
was
radiantly
happy
while
she
was
making
experiments
with
a
new
voice
nika
was
still
absorbed
in
her
work
the
mother
only
entered
the
room
now
and
then
and
as
agnes
was
singing
with
her
cornelli
did
not
have
the
feeling
that
anybody
was
listening
so
she
sang
quite
freely
and
let
her
whole
full
voice
flow
out
agnes
became
more
eager
all
the
time
and
it
really
sounded
as
if
a
whole
chorus
were
singing
in
the
room
at
last
the
mother
stood
still
and
nika
lifting
her
head
from
her
work
listened
too
when
the
song
was
done
agnes
clapped
her
hands
and
said
oh
cornelli
your
voice
is
as
clear
as
a
bell
oh
if
i
only
had
a
voice
like
that
what
wonderful
things
i
could
sing
then
do
you
know
many
songs
cornelli
just
tell
me
all
you
know
cornelli
looked
over
the
song
book
before
her
she
knew
quite
a
number
of
the
songs
in
it
for
martha
had
taught
her
many
agnes
was
in
raptures
oh
now
our
evening
songs
wo
be
like
a
feeble
chirping
any
more
now
everything
everything
will
be
different
she
cried
out
suddenly
struck
with
a
new
idea
she
ran
over
to
her
other
music
books
she
got
a
book
of
songs
for
two
voices
which
she
had
only
been
able
to
use
at
her
music
lessons
and
never
at
home
for
nika
could
not
join
her
come
cornelli
try
to
sing
after
me
now
this
is
your
part
and
when
you
know
it
i
sing
mine
here
are
your
notes
she
instructed
cornelli
and
with
that
she
began
to
sing
cornelli
did
not
know
the
notes
very
well
because
maelinger
had
not
instructed
her
very
deeply
in
that
subject
her
ear
however
was
correct
and
she
could
immediately
repeat
a
melody
agnes
began
with
the
easiest
songs
and
it
did
not
take
cornelli
any
time
to
learn
them
she
soon
knew
where
to
pause
and
where
to
take
up
her
part
again
so
a
second
piece
was
started
and
soon
a
third
then
they
repeated
them
all
again
and
before
long
they
could
sing
three
songs
quite
well
once
more
once
more
agnes
urged
her
it
went
better
every
time
and
in
the
end
they
sang
together
perfectly
agnes
jumped
up
from
her
seat
and
exclaimed
oh
you
are
a
wonderful
cornelli
who
would
have
thought
it
please
do
not
go
home
yet
stay
here
and
then
we
can
sing
together
every
day
have
you
heard
it
mama
the
mother
affirmed
it
and
told
them
that
she
and
dino
had
both
enjoyed
the
singing
dino
had
asked
to
have
his
door
kept
open
for
he
had
wanted
to
hear
it
all
do
you
know
what
we
do
cornelli
said
agnes
morning
we
study
a
festive
duet
we
shall
greet
dino
with
it
when
he
comes
back
to
this
room
again
for
the
first
time
cornelli
gladly
agreed
it
was
time
now
for
their
accustomed
evening
song
which
had
been
put
off
longer
than
usual
that
day
agnes
was
of
the
decided
opinion
that
it
was
not
suitable
to
end
this
day
with
a
mild
evening
song
she
suggested
a
loud
hymn
of
praise
and
thanks
she
started
it
with
enthusiasm
and
all
the
others
soon
joined
the
unexpected
joy
and
great
friendliness
agnes
had
shown
had
made
cornelli
so
happy
and
astonished
that
she
sat
a
long
time
on
her
bed
in
the
little
room
she
was
wondering
to
herself
why
she
could
never
be
quite
happy
in
spite
of
everybody
goodness
but
she
knew
soon
enough
why
this
was
so
her
old
fear
had
not
left
her
she
fully
realized
that
she
looked
different
from
other
children
and
that
her
horns
would
get
worse
till
they
could
not
be
hidden
any
more
then
everybody
would
think
what
mux
had
thought
even
if
they
did
not
say
it
next
morning
when
cornelli
had
just
gotten
up
halm
entered
her
room
cornelli
she
said
taking
the
child
hand
you
have
made
us
all
so
happy
you
have
done
much
for
dino
by
helping
him
to
pass
many
pleasant
hours
and
you
have
entertained
my
little
restless
mux
so
wonderfully
that
he
can
hardly
live
without
you
any
more
i
should
like
to
do
something
for
you
now
i
should
love
to
make
you
look
festive
and
get
rid
forever
of
everything
that
disfigures
you
the
mother
had
already
begun
to
smooth
out
the
child
thick
hair
oh
no
oh
no
please
do
do
it
cornelli
cried
out
then
everything
will
be
lost
i
want
to
go
home
oh
i
must
go
home
oh
they
will
all
laugh
at
me
and
they
wo
like
me
any
more
oh
you
do
know
how
it
is
i
know
everything
dear
child
the
mother
said
quietly
dino
has
told
me
everything
do
you
know
child
that
i
love
you
you
know
cornelli
that
i
would
not
do
anything
that
might
hurt
you
the
least
bit
or
that
would
not
help
you
i
want
to
free
you
from
an
error
cornelli
no
no
it
is
not
an
error
surely
not
cornelli
called
out
in
her
great
anxiety
my
cousin
said
it
and
miss
grideelen
said
it
too
they
saw
it
and
i
know
it
oh
please
do
brush
my
hair
away
cornelli
the
mother
went
on
calmly
the
ladies
told
you
they
saw
little
horns
on
your
forehead
that
got
bigger
every
time
you
wrinkled
up
your
brow
you
are
afraid
that
this
is
really
so
and
that
it
is
getting
worse
you
understood
it
in
a
way
they
did
not
mean
they
only
wanted
to
tell
you
that
when
you
frowned
you
looked
as
if
you
had
horns
on
your
forehead
and
they
said
it
to
keep
you
from
frowning
they
meant
well
by
you
but
you
misunderstood
them
but
you
can
understand
me
just
let
me
help
you
to
be
happy
again
have
you
any
confidence
in
me
cornelli
tell
me
do
you
think
that
i
would
do
anything
that
would
make
you
repulsive
in
the
eyes
of
everyone
do
you
believe
that
i
know
you
do
child
cornelli
only
groaned
a
little
with
nimble
hands
the
mother
had
in
the
meantime
kept
on
smoothing
and
combing
the
child
heavy
hair
it
already
lay
beautifully
parted
on
both
sides
of
her
face
the
brown
wavy
hair
framed
a
brow
for
not
a
ray
of
sunshine
had
penetrated
through
the
hair
all
summer
long
the
mother
finished
the
two
heavy
tresses
and
wound
them
about
cornelli
head
like
a
crown
smilingly
the
mother
looked
into
cornelli
face
the
great
change
had
thrilled
her
with
joy
now
come
with
me
to
the
children
we
shall
see
if
they
can
notice
any
change
she
said
and
taking
the
little
girl
hand
she
led
her
away
cornelli
was
extremely
glad
to
enter
the
room
at
the
mother
side
for
she
would
not
have
dared
to
go
alone
when
the
door
opened
she
looked
shyly
at
the
floor
mux
had
already
been
waiting
for
his
companion
and
now
ran
to
meet
her
what
have
you
done
cornelli
he
cried
out
in
sudden
surprise
your
forehead
looks
quite
clean
and
neat
and
you
have
shiny
eyes
like
a
canary
bird
and
you
do
look
like
an
owl
any
more
why
cornelli
you
are
transformed
agnes
exclaimed
just
let
me
see
you
make
a
little
room
mux
no
i
do
know
you
any
more
it
is
fortunate
you
did
it
for
it
is
a
pleasure
to
look
at
you
now
your
mother
has
done
it
cornelli
explained
confusedly
for
she
was
quite
overcome
at
all
these
manifestations
of
joy
nika
also
glanced
up
at
her
you
are
a
different
child
cornelli
and
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
ever
have
gotten
the
way
you
were
these
words
were
said
in
such
a
charming
manner
that
a
deep
sensation
of
filled
cornelli
she
tried
to
fight
against
it
however
for
she
did
not
think
it
possible
that
she
should
suddenly
become
freed
from
her
horrible
sickening
fear
agnes
was
very
anxious
to
practice
their
song
for
the
festive
reception
of
the
newly
risen
dino
and
cornelli
too
was
filled
with
ardor
the
two
children
kept
up
their
singing
quite
a
while
for
agnes
could
not
weary
of
trying
the
songs
for
two
voices
which
she
had
never
before
been
able
to
use
dino
did
not
come
until
lunch
time
though
he
was
still
very
pale
he
felt
extremely
lively
hurrah
cornelli
he
cried
out
as
he
entered
the
living
room
now
you
look
again
the
way
you
used
to
in
when
you
forgot
to
pull
your
curtains
over
your
brow
you
even
look
better
than
that
cornelli
you
look
perfectly
splendid
another
hurrah
for
this
great
joy
the
next
moment
a
surprise
came
for
dino
the
lovely
festive
song
which
agnes
and
cornelli
were
singing
in
his
honor
the
voice
of
the
latter
was
full
of
purity
and
strength
and
dino
kept
on
signalling
to
nika
over
and
over
again
saying
in
a
low
voice
do
you
hear
it
do
you
see
it
do
you
notice
it
at
last
it
was
quite
evident
that
two
had
not
been
of
the
same
opinion
about
cornelli
till
that
day
so
they
all
had
a
merry
feast
in
cornelli
heart
the
feeling
of
delicious
gradually
began
to
drive
away
all
other
sensations
her
old
gaiety
broke
forth
boundlessly
and
roused
all
the
others
as
well
to
great
merriment
and
joy
dino
looked
quite
well
again
and
his
eyes
fairly
beamed
with
happiness
even
the
mother
joined
in
their
gay
mood
and
she
had
to
glance
over
and
over
again
at
her
two
daughters
who
had
seldom
shown
such
unclouded
joy
she
heaved
a
secret
sigh
however
and
asked
herself
i
wonder
how
long
this
happiness
will
last
for
we
have
hard
times
before
us
was
i
right
after
all
dino
said
to
his
sisters
when
cornelli
had
retired
and
the
family
separated
at
bedtime
the
sisters
till
now
had
made
disparaging
remarks
to
him
about
cornelli
we
do
not
see
what
attracts
you
in
her
they
had
said
we
do
understand
how
you
can
find
her
entertaining
and
so
on
when
cornelli
was
alone
in
her
room
that
night
she
felt
as
in
a
dream
what
had
happened
to
her
was
it
really
true
that
the
great
sorrow
which
had
weighed
on
her
and
had
taken
all
her
joy
away
had
forever
disappeared
the
mother
had
told
her
firmly
that
it
had
been
an
error
and
the
children
had
proved
it
to
be
so
by
their
reception
of
her
so
she
could
be
happy
again
as
she
had
always
been
cornelli
was
filled
with
joy
and
praise
to
god
at
this
thought
how
wonderfully
god
has
led
me
she
said
in
her
heart
she
remembered
how
anxiously
she
had
prayed
to
him
to
prevent
her
from
being
sent
to
town
now
she
had
come
to
town
but
in
such
a
different
way
from
what
she
had
feared
she
had
been
freed
from
her
trouble
by
going
away
martha
had
certainly
been
right
and
she
would
always
try
to
remember
this
in
the
future
she
would
pray
to
god
that
she
might
do
everything
according
to
his
will
and
she
made
up
her
mind
that
she
would
never
again
try
to
force
the
fulfilment
of
her
own
wishes
she
felt
that
she
owed
the
good
lord
in
heaven
especial
praises
so
she
lay
down
to
sleep
quite
late
and
because
of
her
happiness
even
stayed
awake
a
long
time
after
her
prayers
were
said
i
have
to
tell
you
something
cornelli
said
the
mother
next
day
when
all
the
family
was
peacefully
gathered
around
the
supper
table
you
know
that
i
have
written
to
your
father
asking
him
to
let
you
stay
here
a
little
longer
he
has
answered
me
saying
that
he
would
be
very
pleased
if
his
little
daughter
could
stay
with
us
for
a
year
and
could
take
all
the
lessons
that
my
daughters
are
taking
but
he
leaves
you
free
to
decide
about
it
so
you
must
write
to
your
father
to
let
him
know
the
answer
to
his
proposal
oh
you
must
stay
here
cornelli
wo
you
please
stay
dino
exclaimed
then
you
can
be
here
till
summer
time
and
we
two
can
go
back
to
together
for
it
is
quite
settled
that
i
am
going
again
to
our
good
old
martha
and
i
go
too
mux
said
with
conviction
do
you
know
cornelli
he
whispered
into
her
ear
i
stay
with
you
all
the
time
in
your
own
house
and
dino
can
go
alone
to
old
martha
agnes
was
simply
enchanted
with
this
new
prospect
oh
how
wonderful
how
wonderful
she
exclaimed
over
and
over
again
now
we
can
have
singing
lessons
together
and
sing
again
at
home
oh
that
is
too
wonderful
nika
also
begged
cornelli
to
stay
i
hope
you
will
tell
your
father
that
you
intend
to
remain
with
us
cornelli
she
said
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
know
you
well
cornelli
eyes
sparkled
with
pleasure
for
now
the
whole
family
wanted
to
keep
her
with
them
suddenly
a
thought
flashed
through
her
when
her
father
had
threatened
to
send
her
to
town
for
a
year
she
had
been
terribly
upset
and
now
the
year
spent
in
town
with
this
family
seemed
like
pure
pleasure
how
different
everything
had
been
from
what
she
had
thought
and
feared
i
should
love
to
stay
here
she
exclaimed
with
deep
emotion
can
i
write
to
papa
now
that
suited
halm
exactly
sitting
down
beside
cornelli
she
also
wrote
to
hellmut
and
both
letters
were
sent
at
once
two
days
later
hellmut
was
sitting
at
the
breakfast
table
looking
at
his
mail
first
of
all
he
opened
a
fat
envelope
which
had
come
to
him
from
town
there
were
two
letters
in
it
which
caused
him
great
surprise
halm
wrote
that
all
the
members
of
her
family
had
joyfully
received
his
proposal
to
leave
cornelli
with
them
for
a
longer
stay
she
told
him
that
they
had
all
become
so
fond
of
cornelli
that
she
would
have
left
behind
a
feeling
of
real
loss
cornelli
letter
read
as
follows
dear
papa
i
should
love
to
stay
here
for
the
mother
and
all
the
children
are
very
good
to
me
and
i
love
them
dearly
i
should
also
like
to
learn
lots
and
lots
of
things
nika
and
agnes
know
so
much
and
are
so
clever
and
i
should
be
so
glad
to
learn
what
they
know
i
shall
be
unspeakably
happy
if
you
will
let
me
stay
please
give
my
love
to
martha
esther
and
matthew
your
cornelli
after
reading
the
letters
the
director
shook
his
head
what
on
earth
has
happened
he
said
to
himself
a
few
weeks
have
hardly
passed
since
they
told
me
that
this
child
could
not
be
set
to
rights
and
i
have
myself
seen
how
stubborn
she
was
and
how
strangely
she
behaved
and
what
a
change
already
however
i
must
not
take
literally
what
has
probably
been
written
in
a
moment
of
excitement
hellmut
was
very
glad
about
cornelli
intention
to
remain
in
town
for
thus
his
greatest
care
had
been
taken
from
him
a
lovely
woman
who
with
her
children
had
made
a
most
favorable
impression
on
him
had
promised
to
devote
herself
to
his
child
and
he
only
wondered
how
long
the
present
arrangement
would
last
halm
had
soon
arranged
a
regular
course
of
studies
for
cornelli
agnes
was
very
anxious
for
her
to
start
music
lessons
right
away
for
she
thought
that
that
was
the
most
important
thing
cornelli
herself
was
eager
to
do
this
for
she
wanted
to
learn
everything
that
nika
and
agnes
were
learning
so
she
threw
herself
with
fresh
energy
into
all
the
fields
of
study
that
were
opened
to
her
dino
also
was
going
to
school
for
he
had
entirely
recovered
every
morning
the
four
children
started
out
gaily
talking
eagerly
while
they
walked
down
the
street
until
they
finally
separated
for
their
various
schools
if
they
met
again
on
their
way
home
they
were
still
more
lively
for
they
would
tell
each
other
all
their
experiences
cornelli
surpassed
them
all
in
that
respect
she
had
the
talent
of
describing
everything
in
such
a
funny
and
vivid
fashion
that
she
made
them
all
laugh
mux
alone
was
unhappy
in
these
days
for
he
had
lost
his
beloved
companion
full
of
anger
he
would
meet
the
four
laughing
school
children
when
they
were
coming
up
the
stairs
and
would
say
if
i
owned
all
the
schools
i
would
certainly
burn
them
but
i
hope
not
all
the
teachers
too
mux
said
dino
for
then
one
would
have
to
tell
an
even
worse
tale
about
you
than
you
were
telling
about
agnes
the
door
between
cornelli
and
the
sisters
room
was
always
open
now
for
they
all
had
wished
it
there
was
not
a
single
evening
on
which
they
did
not
make
use
of
the
last
moment
for
talking
to
each
other
about
their
mutual
interests
cornelli
was
filled
with
admiration
for
nika
and
for
everything
she
did
she
could
not
understand
how
nika
who
was
so
lovely
and
could
do
such
wonderful
things
could
have
a
sorrow
she
had
never
forgotten
about
it
because
she
had
often
noticed
that
the
young
girl
suffered
from
some
grief
even
agnes
often
stopped
laughing
quite
suddenly
she
would
say
yes
cornelli
it
is
easy
for
you
to
be
jolly
it
is
easy
for
you
so
cornelli
knew
that
agnes
also
carried
a
care
about
with
her
when
agnes
frowned
and
made
dreadful
wrinkles
cornelli
was
quite
sure
that
then
her
sorrow
was
hurting
her
she
would
have
loved
to
help
her
but
she
had
never
asked
her
friends
about
it
she
knew
that
she
had
been
glad
when
nobody
had
asked
her
about
her
own
trouble
one
day
it
happened
that
agnes
came
home
from
her
music
lesson
quite
upset
and
terribly
excited
oh
mama
she
called
from
the
door
the
teacher
has
given
us
the
pieces
today
which
we
have
to
play
for
our
examinations
he
has
given
me
the
most
difficult
one
and
while
giving
it
to
me
he
said
shall
really
make
something
fine
out
of
you
agnes
was
throwing
her
music
sheets
away
as
if
they
were
her
greatest
enemies
then
she
ran
away
to
her
room
there
she
threw
herself
down
on
a
chair
and
began
to
sob
loudly
cornelli
had
followed
her
for
she
was
filled
with
sympathy
putting
her
arms
about
agnes
she
said
tell
me
agnes
what
makes
you
cry
i
know
what
it
is
like
to
have
to
cry
like
that
but
why
do
you
do
it
now
when
your
teacher
has
just
praised
you
what
good
is
that
to
me
agnes
burst
out
how
does
it
help
me
to
play
ever
so
well
what
good
would
it
ever
do
me
even
to
practice
day
and
night
nika
and
i
can
only
keep
on
one
year
more
and
then
everything
is
over
then
she
ca
paint
any
more
and
i
ca
have
any
more
music
lessons
for
we
shall
have
to
become
dressmakers
we
even
have
time
to
go
through
the
higher
classes
in
school
i
would
a
thousand
times
rather
travel
through
the
world
and
sing
in
front
of
the
houses
for
pennies
yes
i
do
that
ca
your
mother
help
you
asked
cornelli
remembering
the
help
in
her
own
case
no
she
ca
and
she
is
very
unhappy
herself
there
is
not
a
soul
on
earth
who
could
help
us
for
our
guardian
says
that
it
just
has
to
be
cornelli
was
quite
crushed
by
this
explanation
for
now
she
understood
quite
well
why
nika
often
had
such
sad
eyes
the
hopeless
prospect
made
cornelli
heart
heavy
too
when
agnes
had
had
such
a
passionate
outbreak
she
did
not
regain
her
composure
for
several
days
then
nika
would
not
say
a
word
either
and
the
mother
only
looked
very
sadly
at
her
children
then
dino
also
became
silent
for
he
knew
what
tormented
his
mother
and
his
sisters
he
would
have
loved
to
help
them
but
he
knew
no
way
so
cornelli
could
not
laugh
any
more
either
and
her
friend
great
sorrow
weighed
on
her
too
for
she
had
experienced
a
heavy
grief
herself
and
had
not
forgotten
what
it
was
like
chapter
x
new
life
in
winter
had
come
for
the
inhabitants
of
the
garret
lodging
the
days
were
filled
with
so
much
regular
work
that
the
nights
were
always
greeted
with
loud
regrets
and
complaints
they
were
always
sorry
when
the
day
was
done
and
no
more
time
was
left
for
their
plans
agnes
was
especially
angry
and
ready
to
spit
fire
from
disgust
at
the
arrival
of
the
hated
bedtime
which
always
broke
up
everything
we
lose
half
of
our
lives
in
sleeping
she
indignantly
called
out
several
times
i
wish
you
would
let
us
sing
all
night
long
mother
she
said
we
should
only
be
more
keen
for
our
other
work
next
day
if
we
could
really
devote
ourselves
to
music
for
a
while
instead
of
always
stopping
off
in
the
middle
whenever
we
are
in
the
mood
to
sing
the
children
mother
however
did
not
agree
with
agnes
so
the
nights
had
to
be
used
for
sleeping
as
before
cornelli
singing
delighted
agnes
more
and
more
cornelli
sang
everything
as
lightly
and
freely
as
a
bird
and
with
such
a
clear
and
resonant
voice
that
everybody
got
pleasure
from
it
there
was
no
other
voice
in
the
whole
school
which
was
as
sure
and
as
full
as
cornelli
even
the
teacher
said
so
and
during
the
singing
lesson
he
placed
her
right
in
front
of
him
because
she
was
the
best
leader
of
the
chorus
in
the
middle
of
winter
hellmut
wrote
to
halm
to
inform
her
that
he
was
taking
a
lengthy
journey
to
foreign
parts
as
he
felt
that
cornelli
was
well
taken
care
of
in
her
household
he
was
anxious
to
use
this
opportunity
for
travelling
he
also
wrote
that
he
had
shortened
his
last
trip
in
order
not
to
tie
his
kind
cousin
and
her
friend
too
long
to
his
lonely
house
he
told
her
that
he
was
very
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
pay
her
and
cornelli
a
visit
before
leaving
for
he
had
to
start
at
once
never
before
had
spring
come
so
fast
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
cornelli
who
was
walking
home
alone
one
day
from
school
the
winter
had
gone
by
and
already
a
mild
wind
was
blowing
through
the
streets
and
the
melting
snow
was
dropping
from
the
roofs
from
the
top
of
a
roof
a
little
bird
was
whistling
and
singing
a
song
of
delight
to
the
bright
blue
sky
above
cornelli
school
had
been
over
sooner
than
the
other
children
so
she
was
in
no
hurry
and
stood
still
to
listen
a
ray
of
sunshine
was
flowing
into
the
street
and
the
bird
kept
on
singing
and
whistling
on
and
on
a
heavenly
familiar
sound
suddenly
the
lovely
beech
wood
at
home
rose
before
cornelli
eyes
and
she
saw
the
trees
in
their
first
green
leaves
the
first
violets
under
the
hedge
her
beloved
first
violets
she
saw
the
yellow
crocuses
sparkling
beside
the
bright
red
primroses
in
the
garden
the
birds
at
home
used
to
whistle
above
her
in
all
the
trees
in
just
the
same
way
as
these
in
the
city
oh
how
lovely
the
coming
of
the
spring
had
always
been
at
home
how
wonderful
it
would
be
to
see
all
these
familiar
sights
again
at
that
thought
cornelli
ran
to
the
house
as
fast
as
she
possibly
could
sitting
down
beside
her
she
wrote
as
follows
dear
papa
i
am
sure
it
is
more
beautiful
at
home
now
than
anywhere
else
may
i
come
home
soon
i
am
sure
that
the
violets
are
out
and
that
everything
is
getting
green
in
the
woods
soon
there
will
be
lots
of
flowers
in
the
garden
and
later
on
the
roses
and
then
all
the
berries
and
in
the
meadows
will
come
out
i
know
now
that
it
is
nowhere
as
beautiful
as
at
home
i
should
love
to
show
the
mother
and
the
girls
everything
and
i
know
that
mux
would
adore
the
little
kid
dino
already
loves
the
meadows
and
the
garden
and
i
hope
that
he
will
come
to
again
if
i
could
only
soon
see
it
all
again
a
great
many
kisses
from
your
daughter
cornelli
cornelli
did
not
get
an
answer
from
her
father
for
three
weeks
he
wrote
to
her
that
his
journey
had
been
lengthened
beyond
his
expectation
he
also
said
how
glad
he
was
that
his
daughter
had
suddenly
realized
what
a
beautiful
home
she
had
but
that
he
disapproved
entirely
of
her
leaving
her
school
abruptly
he
told
her
to
stay
in
town
till
the
summer
holidays
for
he
was
obliged
himself
to
stay
away
till
then
he
gave
her
permission
to
invite
for
the
holidays
all
the
family
who
had
been
so
good
to
her
for
he
and
cornelli
too
had
much
reason
to
be
grateful
to
halm
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
all
of
them
in
the
house
and
he
would
like
to
have
them
with
him
all
summer
long
cornelli
at
first
was
a
little
disappointed
that
it
was
going
to
be
so
long
before
she
could
be
home
and
see
again
the
garden
the
meadows
and
the
beech
wood
for
her
longing
for
them
had
grown
more
and
more
but
when
she
thought
of
the
prospect
of
having
all
the
family
with
her
all
summer
including
dino
and
his
mother
she
was
so
happy
that
all
her
disappointment
vanished
her
joy
was
supreme
when
that
day
at
lunch
time
she
gave
the
family
her
father
invitation
on
all
sides
she
perceived
signs
of
boundless
joy
nika
and
agnes
had
had
the
firm
conviction
that
they
were
to
spend
the
summer
as
usual
in
the
hot
garret
dwelling
without
any
special
holidays
and
now
they
could
spend
all
summer
in
beautiful
about
which
dino
had
told
them
so
much
he
had
described
house
and
garden
as
a
perfect
paradise
and
now
they
would
live
there
themselves
agnes
screamed
for
joy
and
nika
face
was
radiant
with
happiness
halm
was
greatly
moved
with
gratitude
and
delight
she
had
been
worrying
lately
about
dino
for
she
had
been
uncertain
whether
she
would
be
able
to
send
him
away
long
enough
for
the
boy
to
be
properly
strengthened
she
had
feared
that
the
time
would
have
to
be
exceedingly
short
and
that
the
benefit
therefore
would
be
very
slight
now
the
good
god
had
suddenly
taken
all
her
anxiety
from
her
and
had
changed
it
into
a
boundless
blessing
dino
smiled
with
complete
satisfaction
and
said
again
and
again
i
wish
you
knew
how
wonderful
it
all
is
such
a
garden
and
such
trees
such
a
stable
and
such
horses
oh
how
i
love
beautiful
mux
called
out
louder
and
louder
oh
cornelli
take
me
along
he
could
not
realize
that
he
was
really
going
too
there
were
still
many
days
and
even
weeks
before
their
bliss
would
come
true
but
with
this
heavenly
prospect
before
them
the
children
performed
their
remaining
duties
only
too
joyfully
it
was
different
for
cornelli
her
longing
for
her
home
had
grown
more
violent
every
day
wherever
she
saw
a
green
tree
or
a
bush
she
saw
the
garden
at
home
the
meadows
and
the
flowers
in
before
her
mind
eye
so
her
desire
to
return
there
to
see
it
all
again
became
almost
painful
she
felt
finally
as
if
the
day
would
never
come
when
she
could
again
see
her
home
it
came
nevertheless
a
large
trunk
was
taken
away
on
a
cart
and
the
whole
family
followed
it
towards
the
station
trina
came
last
in
her
wondering
eyes
one
could
see
that
despite
all
the
preparations
she
did
not
yet
believe
the
reality
of
the
coming
journey
cornelli
had
begged
halm
so
urgently
to
let
her
go
too
that
the
child
wish
had
been
granted
cornelli
had
been
willing
to
take
the
responsibility
for
the
unexpected
guest
mux
was
so
excited
that
he
kept
on
running
in
front
of
everybody
and
hindering
them
all
in
walking
be
sensible
mux
dino
exclaimed
if
you
go
on
like
that
miss
the
train
and
there
wo
be
any
trip
these
words
disconcerted
mux
to
such
a
degree
that
he
simply
tore
away
down
the
street
dino
had
to
run
after
him
to
catch
him
for
mux
knew
no
road
or
way
and
had
dashed
ahead
only
in
his
fear
of
arriving
too
late
at
last
they
reached
the
station
and
entered
their
car
now
they
were
moving
out
into
the
beautiful
country
the
sun
was
shining
over
the
fields
and
woods
and
there
was
not
a
single
cloud
in
the
sky
cornelli
was
sitting
beside
the
open
window
eagerly
looking
out
the
journey
lasted
for
a
little
more
than
two
hours
and
as
soon
as
it
was
over
they
got
out
here
he
comes
here
he
comes
cornelli
cried
out
running
towards
the
road
which
led
into
the
valley
here
matthew
was
just
stopping
the
pair
of
horses
from
their
lively
trot
in
a
moment
cornelli
was
at
the
dismounting
coachman
side
calling
to
him
how
are
you
matthew
i
am
coming
home
again
is
everything
at
home
still
the
same
welcome
cornelli
welcome
home
he
said
radiant
with
joy
for
his
master
child
was
his
greatest
pride
but
how
you
have
grown
cornelli
oh
how
changed
our
cornelli
is
matthew
shook
her
hand
with
great
delight
and
then
opened
the
carriage
door
for
the
family
who
had
approached
oh
here
is
the
young
gentleman
from
last
summer
matthew
said
again
shaking
dino
hand
but
you
looked
better
when
you
were
with
us
oh
yes
the
young
gentleman
looked
much
better
then
i
think
i
should
think
so
matthew
said
dino
of
course
i
looked
better
when
i
could
drink
such
good
milk
from
the
stable
in
the
fine
fresh
morning
air
it
was
different
in
town
halm
had
entered
the
carriage
and
the
two
girls
had
followed
mux
gazing
motionless
at
the
shining
horses
could
not
be
taken
away
in
a
hurry
from
that
wonderful
sight
they
are
coming
along
too
said
matthew
who
enjoyed
the
open
admiration
the
little
boy
was
showing
you
will
be
able
to
look
at
them
every
day
and
you
can
ride
on
them
to
the
fountain
that
helped
the
situation
everybody
was
soon
inside
of
the
carriage
and
trina
sat
beside
matthew
on
the
coachman
box
now
they
galloped
gaily
along
into
the
valley
oh
mother
just
look
at
the
red
daisies
cornelli
cried
out
oh
look
at
the
golden
buttercups
oh
look
look
see
all
the
blue
cornelli
had
jumped
up
for
she
could
not
sit
still
anymore
and
was
looking
forwards
and
backwards
to
right
and
to
left
the
meadows
had
never
been
so
full
of
flowers
and
every
few
moments
cornelli
cried
out
with
delight
when
the
carriage
drove
into
the
courtyard
cornelli
was
the
first
to
jump
down
oh
esther
how
are
you
she
called
to
her
old
friend
full
of
dignity
and
covered
with
a
spotless
white
apron
the
cook
stood
ready
to
receive
the
guests
oh
now
i
am
home
again
is
everything
still
the
same
is
the
garden
still
the
way
it
was
and
martha
and
her
house
too
yes
yes
cornelli
and
how
are
you
returned
esther
looking
eagerly
at
cornelli
how
you
have
changed
in
truth
you
have
changed
wonderfully
you
are
not
the
same
cornelli
was
already
running
into
the
house
to
the
and
to
her
own
wardrobe
yes
everything
had
remained
the
same
she
flew
outside
again
to
the
mother
to
lead
her
into
the
house
the
face
fairly
beamed
with
joy
cornelli
father
was
busy
working
in
his
office
hearing
the
sound
of
the
approaching
wheels
he
started
here
they
are
already
he
said
to
himself
he
hastily
threw
off
his
working
coat
and
putting
on
a
good
coat
left
the
iron
foundry
while
he
was
walking
across
the
courtyard
he
sighed
deeply
freshly
stamped
in
his
memory
he
saw
before
him
his
only
child
as
she
had
looked
when
he
had
returned
from
his
journey
a
year
ago
cornelli
had
stood
before
him
shyly
with
averted
glance
resembling
a
little
savage
who
had
never
been
combed
i
wonder
what
the
child
is
like
now
he
muttered
to
himself
as
he
entered
the
living
room
cornelli
looked
up
at
him
the
director
was
quite
startled
at
what
he
saw
now
cornelli
flew
up
to
him
oh
papa
oh
papa
it
is
so
wonderful
to
be
home
again
everything
is
still
the
way
it
used
to
be
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
be
home
again
the
father
wanted
to
embrace
his
child
but
before
he
did
so
he
held
her
at
arm
length
to
gaze
at
her
once
more
cornelli
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
you
look
at
me
the
way
your
mother
used
to
you
have
grown
just
like
your
mother
he
said
putting
his
arms
lovingly
about
her
how
was
it
possible
how
could
you
change
in
this
way
how
did
it
happen
mother
knows
about
it
papa
mother
has
helped
me
said
cornelli
going
with
shining
eyes
to
the
mother
for
halm
had
retreated
to
the
back
of
the
room
the
director
now
turned
to
his
new
guest
welcome
to
our
house
he
said
heartily
greeting
both
her
and
the
children
holding
hand
within
his
own
he
continued
with
emotion
how
different
you
have
brought
her
back
to
me
how
did
you
do
it
can
this
be
the
same
child
that
i
brought
you
the
happy
father
had
to
look
at
cornelli
over
and
over
again
for
he
hardly
yet
realized
that
this
was
his
child
was
this
really
cornelli
and
not
a
creature
of
his
imagination
so
he
held
the
child
hand
and
looked
again
and
again
into
her
shining
eyes
it
really
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
believe
it
esther
laden
with
the
dinner
dishes
now
came
into
the
room
to
set
the
table
she
informed
her
master
that
the
guest
rooms
were
ready
and
that
she
supposed
the
ladies
wanted
to
retire
before
the
coming
meal
halm
and
her
daughter
gladly
followed
her
but
cornelli
said
oh
papa
can
i
run
over
to
martha
i
be
back
very
soon
dino
also
begged
to
go
for
he
longed
to
see
old
martha
again
as
the
permission
had
readily
been
given
the
two
children
started
off
they
had
meant
to
run
down
the
path
but
cornelli
could
not
go
fast
the
meadow
was
so
full
of
daisies
buttercups
and
especially
of
blue
her
favorite
flowers
that
she
felt
as
if
she
had
to
gather
them
all
and
dino
had
to
remind
her
that
their
time
was
short
and
that
the
flowers
would
still
be
there
martha
had
heard
that
cornelli
and
her
guests
were
expected
that
day
so
she
had
several
times
glanced
towards
the
garden
to
see
if
she
could
discover
trace
of
her
or
of
dino
now
both
came
flying
up
the
steps
and
martha
ran
out
to
meet
them
oh
yes
here
was
dino
dino
whom
she
knew
so
well
and
cornelli
too
martha
looked
at
the
child
and
tried
to
say
something
instead
of
that
however
bright
tears
started
to
her
eyes
and
she
was
unable
to
speak
oh
martha
how
i
have
looked
forward
to
coming
home
and
coming
to
you
right
away
cornelli
exclaimed
are
you
glad
too
martha
oh
i
am
so
happy
i
too
i
too
cornelli
martha
assured
her
what
memories
you
bring
back
to
me
child
for
you
have
grown
just
like
your
mother
oh
how
different
you
are
now
from
what
you
were
god
has
blessed
your
life
in
town
it
seems
like
a
miracle
oh
how
i
have
prayed
for
this
after
these
words
she
shook
dino
hand
looking
at
him
rather
sadly
for
her
great
joy
at
seeing
him
again
was
dimmed
by
his
delicate
appearance
oh
dino
how
pale
and
thin
you
look
she
said
last
year
you
were
so
much
stouter
that
is
why
i
came
again
to
dino
replied
cheerfully
you
must
rejoice
with
us
now
martha
for
cornelli
and
i
are
tremendously
pleased
to
be
here
again
it
is
just
as
lovely
here
as
it
was
last
year
and
now
we
can
come
to
see
you
every
day
for
this
seems
like
home
martha
was
so
moved
that
she
could
not
speak
here
was
cornelli
looking
as
fresh
and
bright
as
ever
all
the
unspeakably
sad
expression
had
vanished
from
her
face
together
with
the
awful
disfigurement
of
those
days
the
old
woman
was
deeply
stirred
by
the
happy
look
in
the
little
girl
eyes
her
young
mother
had
looked
at
her
just
that
way
and
here
was
dino
too
full
of
his
old
attachment
and
speaking
such
kind
words
to
her
she
could
hardly
believe
this
great
happiness
we
have
to
go
now
martha
cornelli
said
but
we
come
every
day
the
way
we
used
to
you
know
that
martha
i
run
over
every
single
day
and
i
too
cried
dino
when
the
happy
little
couple
were
running
away
martha
looked
after
them
from
her
little
stairway
her
eyes
were
moist
yet
followed
the
two
till
they
were
lost
from
sight
even
then
she
still
stood
there
with
folded
hands
oh
good
god
she
said
quietly
my
heart
is
full
of
thankfulness
thou
hast
blessed
everything
that
was
hard
for
the
child
and
hast
turned
everything
to
good
when
the
children
entered
the
house
cornelli
said
just
go
in
dino
i
soon
follow
you
then
she
turned
and
went
into
the
kitchen
oh
i
was
hoping
all
the
time
that
our
cornelli
could
still
find
her
way
to
the
kitchen
said
esther
with
satisfaction
come
and
let
me
have
a
real
look
at
you
cornelli
esther
placed
herself
squarely
in
front
of
the
child
and
said
you
have
grown
a
lot
last
year
cornelli
and
your
hair
is
so
neatly
combed
and
brushed
one
certainly
can
enjoy
looking
at
our
cornelli
now
cornelli
blushed
a
little
for
she
had
to
remember
the
way
she
had
looked
when
she
had
gone
away
she
knew
how
it
had
been
and
how
she
had
shut
her
heart
against
the
help
esther
had
often
offered
her
oh
esther
i
have
to
tell
you
something
where
is
trina
the
maid
who
has
come
with
them
i
told
her
to
go
behind
the
house
to
look
at
the
vegetable
garden
said
esther
she
stood
in
my
way
all
the
time
i
am
afraid
she
is
not
very
quick
no
she
is
i
know
that
but
esther
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
her
please
be
good
to
her
cornelli
begged
you
see
trina
is
and
awkward
but
she
ca
help
it
you
do
know
how
that
is
but
i
know
and
if
you
are
very
good
to
her
she
wo
mind
as
much
being
that
way
wo
you
do
me
that
favor
esther
full
of
surprise
esther
looked
after
the
child
who
was
running
towards
the
dining
room
how
does
she
ever
think
of
such
things
esther
murmured
to
herself
one
might
think
cornelli
had
to
begin
at
the
bottom
herself
instead
of
being
the
director
daughter
who
can
have
whatever
she
wants
esther
kept
on
shaking
her
head
for
quite
a
while
but
she
was
anxious
to
show
cornelli
that
she
was
the
only
daughter
of
the
house
and
could
command
her
she
was
very
proud
of
cornelli
position
and
eager
to
prove
to
her
young
mistress
that
she
was
only
too
happy
to
follow
her
wishes
when
the
first
merry
meal
was
over
the
children
were
allowed
to
run
out
to
the
garden
they
already
knew
what
they
were
going
to
see
there
because
dino
had
described
it
to
them
with
great
enthusiasm
he
had
told
them
about
the
flower
garden
with
its
wealth
of
color
the
trellises
covered
with
red
peaches
the
heavily
laden
pear
and
apple
trees
now
they
could
see
all
those
wonders
for
themselves
including
the
stable
with
the
splendid
cows
and
the
proud
and
shining
horses
so
the
five
children
ran
away
with
great
eagerness
the
director
and
halm
remained
in
the
dining
room
drinking
their
coffee
in
each
other
company
please
hellmut
she
said
as
soon
as
the
door
had
closed
behind
the
children
please
let
me
thank
you
for
your
great
kindness
i
want
to
tell
you
how
grateful
i
am
what
do
you
mean
why
do
you
want
to
thank
me
mrs
halm
the
director
interrupted
her
please
let
me
speak
first
it
is
i
who
want
to
thank
you
i
shall
never
be
able
to
repay
you
for
what
you
have
done
what
wonders
you
have
accomplished
for
my
child
how
you
have
been
able
to
change
and
develop
cornelli
how
well
she
looks
now
i
have
to
gaze
at
her
again
and
again
for
i
can
hardly
believe
that
it
is
the
same
child
how
can
i
thank
you
enough
how
did
you
ever
do
it
and
what
patience
care
and
trouble
you
must
have
taken
with
her
i
am
afraid
that
it
has
required
endless
thought
on
your
part
to
bring
her
back
like
this
oh
no
hellmut
that
was
not
the
way
at
all
said
halm
cornelli
has
cost
me
neither
patience
care
nor
trouble
if
by
a
little
love
i
have
been
able
to
draw
out
the
good
kernel
of
her
nature
and
bring
it
to
happy
development
then
that
is
all
i
have
done
cornelli
has
never
made
my
task
hard
for
me
we
have
all
become
so
fond
of
her
that
we
had
to
think
with
sorrow
of
the
time
when
she
would
leave
us
i
shall
never
forget
what
happy
hours
dino
had
with
cornelli
during
his
illness
and
how
she
constantly
entertained
my
sociable
little
mux
with
her
constant
merriment
and
kindness
yes
hellmut
i
shall
never
forget
what
she
has
done
and
i
can
assure
you
that
you
have
a
lovely
little
daughter
the
director
jumped
up
in
his
excitement
and
strode
to
and
fro
in
the
room
what
different
enthusiasm
from
that
of
a
year
ago
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
saying
halm
he
said
standing
still
before
her
you
are
relieving
me
of
most
dreadful
anxiety
i
have
suffered
perfect
tortures
because
i
was
blaming
myself
for
having
neglected
my
cornelia
child
i
thought
it
was
too
late
and
that
cornelli
had
grown
hopelessly
stubborn
now
you
have
come
and
brought
me
back
my
child
so
that
she
even
resembles
her
mother
in
her
eyes
and
her
whole
expression
and
appearance
my
wife
was
friendly
and
gay
and
now
you
tell
me
that
this
is
cornelli
disposition
too
i
have
to
tell
you
something
else
hellmut
halm
continued
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
a
child
first
impressions
are
very
important
it
is
natural
that
cornelli
missed
her
mother
guidance
but
she
was
not
by
any
means
a
neglected
child
when
she
came
to
me
from
what
she
and
dino
have
told
me
i
am
perfectly
sure
that
martha
gave
cornelli
the
best
one
can
possibly
give
a
child
on
spiritual
education
i
esteem
old
martha
very
highly
for
she
must
love
and
understand
children
as
few
people
do
my
wife
used
to
say
the
same
thing
and
that
is
why
i
had
such
confidence
in
martha
unfortunately
a
time
came
later
on
when
i
feared
that
she
was
wrong
and
i
did
not
realize
what
she
meant
to
cornelli
you
have
reminded
me
of
my
great
debt
at
this
moment
such
loud
laughter
and
rejoicing
sounded
from
below
that
both
stepped
to
the
open
window
mux
was
screaming
loudly
and
seemed
quite
beside
himself
mama
mama
he
cried
out
just
look
at
a
living
goat
boy
and
a
real
goat
come
down
and
see
me
mux
was
sitting
on
the
seat
of
a
lovely
wicker
carriage
with
two
reins
in
one
hand
and
a
whip
in
the
other
while
a
young
and
slender
goat
was
pulling
him
agnes
and
cornelli
were
running
beside
the
carriage
as
protectors
while
dino
held
the
goat
lightly
by
the
reins
to
keep
her
from
running
off
all
the
children
were
screaming
with
delight
at
the
wonderful
ride
matthew
was
standing
beside
the
bushes
to
watch
this
trial
trip
for
he
thought
that
his
help
might
be
needed
he
had
built
the
carriage
for
cornelli
and
had
already
several
times
harnessed
the
goat
so
as
to
teach
her
how
to
behave
when
cornelli
returned
when
matthew
had
first
shown
the
little
conveyance
to
the
children
cornelli
had
said
right
away
that
mux
had
to
take
the
first
ride
in
order
to
realize
the
scene
he
loved
so
much
in
his
picture
book
mux
simply
screamed
to
his
mother
in
wild
joy
to
see
the
wonderful
spectacle
from
near
by
she
came
down
to
the
garden
the
director
also
left
the
house
but
he
went
another
way
not
long
afterwards
he
went
up
martha
little
stairway
to
the
porch
where
the
old
woman
sat
on
her
stool
mending
oh
mr
hellmut
she
called
out
in
her
surprise
opening
the
door
she
led
her
visitor
into
her
room
for
the
porch
was
very
narrow
hellmut
entered
martha
he
said
in
a
tone
i
have
spoiled
your
business
by
taking
your
boarder
away
from
you
forever
that
requires
a
compensation
and
so
i
have
just
bought
your
little
cottage
from
the
farmer
over
there
besides
the
little
piece
of
ground
in
front
of
it
now
you
will
have
more
room
for
your
carnations
and
if
you
manage
well
you
can
surely
have
some
pleasant
days
from
the
rent
which
you
save
are
you
satisfied
oh
hellmut
is
this
little
house
really
my
own
now
and
will
i
really
have
a
garden
besides
oh
mr
hellmut
but
her
benefactor
would
not
let
her
say
any
more
after
heartily
shaking
her
hand
he
hurried
away
the
large
raspberries
were
peeping
out
between
the
green
leaves
and
the
golden
plums
were
dropping
from
the
heavily
laden
branches
from
morning
till
night
on
these
beautiful
summer
days
mux
fairly
swam
in
uninterrupted
bliss
before
he
had
even
opened
his
eyes
in
the
morning
he
would
call
out
to
his
mother
in
his
sleep
oh
mother
are
we
in
still
are
we
still
here
then
the
hours
of
the
day
began
each
more
lovely
than
the
last
and
mux
could
not
tell
which
was
the
best
as
the
boy
spent
most
of
the
day
in
the
stable
the
hayloft
and
the
barn
his
mother
had
been
obliged
to
make
him
a
special
stable
costume
the
little
boy
loved
to
watch
the
milking
of
the
cows
and
he
never
tired
of
admiring
the
horses
and
the
goat
matthew
had
become
his
best
friend
the
gardener
constantly
thought
out
pleasant
surprises
for
mux
who
showed
a
decided
taste
for
farming
if
matthew
had
to
do
some
important
work
where
mux
was
in
his
way
he
always
devised
a
plan
to
keep
the
boy
amused
elsewhere
go
down
there
to
the
raspberry
hedge
mux
he
would
say
the
berries
are
finest
and
biggest
there
because
the
sun
has
cooked
them
through
go
to
the
plum
tree
afterwards
and
wait
for
me
mux
would
obey
promptly
wandering
over
to
the
plum
tree
from
the
raspberry
bushes
which
he
had
lightened
considerably
he
then
would
sit
thoughtfully
under
the
plum
tree
waiting
till
matthew
returned
the
gardener
then
shook
the
tree
so
mightily
that
a
flood
of
golden
plums
came
rolling
down
over
mux
who
could
freely
enjoy
the
wealth
about
him
if
matthew
could
not
be
found
and
cornelli
and
dino
were
busy
with
their
own
plans
and
did
not
need
him
mux
knew
another
friend
who
always
gave
him
a
good
reception
that
friend
was
esther
he
loved
to
find
her
in
the
vegetable
garden
which
was
also
full
of
surprises
for
him
it
was
like
a
marvel
to
the
little
boy
that
the
green
peas
hung
here
in
abundance
whereas
they
were
only
served
at
home
on
feast
days
he
became
quite
scared
when
esther
picked
a
basketful
but
when
he
warned
her
saying
do
take
them
all
for
then
we
wo
have
any
more
she
only
laughed
and
said
they
always
grow
again
in
a
week
there
will
be
plenty
more
if
mux
looked
a
little
timidly
at
the
large
cabbage
heads
esther
said
to
him
do
be
afraid
of
them
mux
if
i
cook
cabbage
everybody
else
likes
it
so
much
that
you
wo
have
to
eat
it
at
all
and
you
can
take
the
potatoes
which
i
serve
with
it
mux
often
accompanied
esther
to
the
kitchen
where
he
soon
picked
up
a
lot
of
useful
knowledge
there
was
no
pastry
the
exact
recipe
of
which
as
well
as
how
it
tasted
mux
could
not
tell
in
this
manner
he
lived
through
heavenly
days
they
were
no
less
heavenly
for
the
other
children
dino
and
cornelli
had
started
the
large
undertaking
of
laying
out
martha
garden
after
their
own
plan
they
were
so
busy
inventing
things
and
carrying
them
out
that
they
could
hardly
ever
be
found
agnes
struggled
with
dino
for
first
place
in
cornelli
affection
but
dino
was
always
the
victor
cornelli
never
forgot
that
he
had
been
her
first
friend
who
had
held
fast
to
their
friendship
for
this
she
remained
faithful
to
him
it
was
a
consolation
to
agnes
that
she
could
play
on
the
lovely
piano
whenever
she
wanted
to
and
that
cornelli
was
always
home
in
the
evenings
when
she
could
sing
with
her
hellmut
would
sit
in
his
while
the
two
girls
sang
one
song
after
another
and
he
could
never
hear
enough
beaming
with
joy
he
would
say
to
halm
from
time
to
time
the
child
has
her
mother
voice
except
that
her
mother
voice
was
still
fuller
and
softer
halm
face
would
beam
too
as
she
would
say
just
have
a
little
patience
director
you
are
sure
some
day
to
hear
cornelli
voice
when
there
will
be
nothing
more
to
desire
in
it
her
teacher
highest
wish
is
to
train
her
voice
for
answer
the
father
nodded
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
smiling
contentedly
nika
too
was
completely
changed
no
shadows
dimmed
her
eyes
for
she
could
wander
about
all
day
with
her
paint
box
from
one
lovely
spot
to
another
up
to
the
beech
wood
or
to
the
hill
where
the
big
oak
tree
stood
there
she
could
sit
on
a
bench
and
look
down
over
the
house
and
garden
and
far
below
into
the
wide
green
valley
nika
was
very
happy
to
be
able
to
spend
all
her
time
in
painting
without
ever
being
disturbed
or
called
away
by
duties
when
the
mother
saw
the
happy
faces
of
her
girls
and
dino
improved
health
she
felt
very
happy
too
suddenly
however
the
thought
would
rise
in
her
how
will
it
be
when
these
lovely
days
are
over
and
we
have
to
start
living
again
in
the
narrow
confines
of
town
and
in
the
shadow
of
those
coming
years
the
holidays
were
nearing
their
end
but
nobody
yet
had
time
to
think
of
that
for
the
director
birthday
was
drawing
near
and
this
was
to
be
the
great
feast
day
for
everybody
halm
had
asked
each
of
the
children
to
think
out
some
surprise
for
hellmut
for
mux
however
she
wrote
a
beautiful
birthday
verse
as
the
little
boy
head
was
filled
solely
with
thoughts
of
the
barn
and
stable
the
kitchen
and
the
goat
cart
the
plums
the
beetles
and
ants
it
took
a
great
deal
of
time
and
trouble
to
fix
the
verse
in
his
memory
nika
needing
no
advice
had
long
ago
decided
what
to
do
every
day
as
soon
as
the
meals
were
over
she
silently
disappeared
agnes
and
cornelli
bolted
the
door
of
the
music
room
and
let
mysterious
songs
issue
from
behind
it
only
dino
was
still
undecided
about
his
task
when
he
was
left
alone
with
his
mother
and
mux
one
day
and
all
the
others
were
busy
with
their
preparations
he
said
tell
me
what
i
could
do
mother
draw
him
a
picture
of
the
beautiful
goat
mux
advised
he
knew
that
dino
could
draw
animals
well
and
to
him
there
was
no
finer
animal
in
all
the
world
than
the
goat
what
a
knowing
goat
boy
you
are
mux
dino
exclaimed
despite
his
refusal
to
draw
the
goat
he
had
nevertheless
gotten
an
idea
from
his
little
brother
oh
i
draw
the
two
brown
horses
he
called
out
joyously
i
make
one
trotting
and
the
other
walking
matthew
must
lead
them
up
for
me
so
the
boy
ran
happily
to
the
stable
and
after
that
day
he
and
matthew
had
many
meetings
in
secret
the
birthday
came
at
last
when
the
director
entered
the
dining
room
in
the
morning
such
a
beautiful
duet
resounded
from
the
next
room
that
he
was
compelled
to
draw
nearer
agnes
and
cornelli
were
both
singing
a
lovely
song
with
such
deep
feeling
that
the
director
could
hardly
speak
when
they
had
ended
he
patted
them
both
on
the
shoulder
with
fatherly
tenderness
and
then
passed
into
the
next
room
here
mux
approached
him
and
said
his
verse
faultlessly
in
a
loud
clear
voice
on
the
table
the
director
found
two
beautiful
drawings
of
his
brown
horses
and
his
joy
over
them
was
so
great
that
he
did
not
put
them
down
for
quite
a
while
but
finally
he
saw
all
at
once
a
large
picture
resting
in
the
middle
of
the
table
his
house
with
the
surrounding
garden
the
luminous
meadow
with
the
view
toward
the
valley
and
the
distant
mountains
beyond
was
painted
in
such
fresh
and
absolutely
natural
colors
that
hellmut
was
quite
overcome
this
was
the
view
he
had
loved
so
passionately
from
his
childhood
cornelli
come
here
the
father
called
just
look
at
this
picture
do
you
have
a
beautiful
home
do
you
love
your
home
as
much
as
your
father
loves
it
oh
yes
papa
i
love
it
so
much
said
cornelli
and
i
have
to
think
every
day
that
i
never
knew
how
beautiful
it
was
before
i
went
away
but
ever
since
i
came
home
again
i
know
oh
how
beautiful
it
looks
in
the
picture
agnes
had
been
standing
behind
cornelli
suddenly
she
exclaimed
passionately
oh
cornelli
if
only
you
did
have
such
a
beautiful
home
agnes
the
mother
said
in
alarm
what
unseemly
words
are
you
saying
the
director
looked
in
astonishment
at
agnes
whose
eyes
were
flashing
fire
while
she
regarded
the
painting
have
you
had
a
disagreement
with
cornelli
is
that
the
reason
why
you
do
want
her
to
have
such
a
beautiful
home
he
asked
with
a
sly
smile
agnes
flushed
scarlet
oh
no
hellmut
i
did
not
mean
it
that
way
i
have
never
fought
with
cornelli
and
i
only
fight
with
dino
because
he
wants
to
have
cornelli
all
the
time
if
cornelli
did
have
this
beautiful
home
and
if
she
were
like
me
and
had
to
give
up
all
her
music
lessons
and
had
to
earn
her
living
we
could
do
fine
things
together
she
has
such
a
beautiful
voice
that
we
could
hire
a
harp
and
could
travel
into
strange
cities
and
sing
before
the
houses
later
on
we
could
give
concerts
and
begin
a
singing
school
but
i
ca
do
anything
alone
at
this
outbreak
which
no
sign
from
her
could
check
the
mother
became
alternately
hot
and
cold
from
fright
agnes
eyes
still
flashed
with
passionate
excitement
like
burning
coals
i
approve
of
the
singing
school
but
especially
of
sitting
down
to
breakfast
i
hope
very
much
that
we
have
the
usual
chocolate
to
drink
for
it
is
a
good
old
custom
for
birthdays
which
should
not
be
neglected
so
a
singing
school
is
to
be
founded
he
continued
while
mux
gazed
solemnly
at
the
three
huge
cakes
which
were
placed
beside
the
three
big
chocolate
pots
the
wandering
harp
players
are
a
little
too
poetical
for
me
but
i
like
the
idea
of
a
school
agnes
as
i
too
wish
to
profit
from
it
i
want
it
to
be
built
on
my
estate
lots
of
our
workmen
in
the
foundry
have
small
children
whose
mothers
are
busy
with
the
housework
and
their
small
babies
so
agnes
and
cornelli
are
going
to
found
a
singing
school
in
where
all
the
children
will
go
whose
mothers
have
no
time
for
singing
upon
their
arrival
the
children
shall
all
be
given
a
bowl
of
milk
and
a
piece
of
bread
apiece
to
make
their
voices
fuller
now
we
have
settled
all
about
the
school
i
shall
also
have
my
two
teachers
instructed
so
that
they
wo
ever
be
out
of
practice
i
have
also
some
work
for
nika
she
shall
fill
my
house
with
lovely
pictures
from
top
to
bottom
to
inspire
her
with
plenty
of
new
ideas
i
am
going
to
send
her
to
her
professor
in
town
for
lessons
dino
shall
help
me
keep
my
two
horses
in
trim
by
giving
them
plenty
of
exercise
for
that
will
be
good
for
him
and
them
i
can
use
mux
by
having
him
trained
to
become
the
manager
of
my
estate
the
good
beginning
he
has
made
in
the
knowledge
of
farming
under
matthew
guidance
shall
be
continued
while
the
ground
is
covered
with
green
and
the
trees
are
bearing
fruit
the
mother
shall
stay
here
for
the
protection
of
you
all
so
tell
me
now
how
you
like
my
plan
shall
it
be
thus
absolute
silence
followed
the
children
hardly
dared
to
realize
that
the
words
they
had
just
heard
were
true
and
the
mother
was
filled
with
deep
emotion
she
could
not
utter
a
word
and
tears
flowed
from
her
eyes
could
it
be
possible
that
her
great
sorrow
and
heavy
cares
were
suddenly
lifted
from
her
could
it
really
be
true
at
that
moment
mux
said
loudly
yes
we
like
it
very
much
he
had
clearly
grasped
that
it
meant
for
him
keeping
on
doing
what
he
had
enjoyed
so
much
under
matthew
and
esther
care
the
director
had
to
laugh
and
continued
i
must
have
the
reply
of
the
chief
my
dear
halm
so
please
listen
to
my
plan
i
shall
let
you
manage
the
children
in
the
winter
and
you
shall
arrange
whatever
they
are
to
learn
but
they
must
come
here
in
the
summer
when
i
can
enjoy
all
the
results
of
their
studies
i
shall
also
enjoy
the
great
advantage
of
having
you
manage
my
house
when
you
are
here
does
that
suit
everybody
or
am
i
getting
more
than
my
share
at
last
the
mother
composed
herself
oh
hellmut
how
can
i
thank
you
she
said
offering
him
her
trembling
hand
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
what
is
in
my
heart
how
can
i
be
grateful
enough
for
such
boundless
kindness
you
can
not
know
what
your
generosity
means
to
us
all
even
the
children
had
understood
that
this
bliss
was
true
nika
was
the
first
to
run
with
beaming
eyes
to
the
director
and
to
seize
his
hand
but
she
could
find
no
words
to
show
her
gratitude
agnes
and
dino
too
had
run
towards
the
director
and
the
latter
did
not
know
how
to
shake
all
the
hands
that
were
offered
to
him
mux
who
could
find
no
access
to
his
benefactor
climbed
up
on
a
chair
and
putting
his
arms
about
him
from
behind
screamed
a
thousand
words
of
thanks
right
into
the
director
ears
the
wild
rejoicing
became
louder
and
louder
cornelli
said
the
father
at
last
give
thanks
to
your
she
has
earned
them
for
she
has
brought
joy
back
to
our
house
cornelli
did
it
with
a
full
and
willing
heart
for
she
realized
what
the
children
mother
had
done
for
her
soon
afterwards
dino
and
cornelli
ran
away
for
they
had
had
a
simultaneous
thought
they
did
not
want
to
wait
another
moment
before
bringing
martha
the
wonderful
news
nobody
on
earth
could
share
their
boundless
happiness
as
martha
would
martha
heart
overflowed
when
she
heard
what
had
been
proposed
between
freely
flowing
tears
she
said
again
and
again
oh
cornelli
everything
has
happened
so
wonderfully
for
you
god
has
ordained
it
much
more
wisely
than
we
could
have
wished
and
prayed
for
from
now
on
we
shall
leave
everything
entirely
in
his
hands
we
do
that
as
long
as
we
live
wo
we
cornelli
cornelli
nodded
with
understanding
she
had
not
forgotten
how
she
had
complained
to
martha
and
how
martha
had
told
her
to
seek
god
help
martha
had
assured
her
that
the
help
would
always
come
even
if
it
revealed
itself
differently
from
the
way
she
expected
now
it
had
all
turned
out
so
gloriously
and
so
much
more
splendidly
than
cornelli
could
ever
have
imagined
there
had
never
been
such
rejoicing
in
the
house
as
agnes
started
when
she
and
nika
had
retired
to
their
room
in
the
evening
and
cornelli
had
come
to
pay
her
accustomed
little
evening
visit
she
skipped
and
danced
about
the
room
like
a
newly
freed
bird
and
called
out
now
our
troubles
are
over
and
no
secret
fears
can
scare
us
any
more
now
we
can
sing
all
we
want
and
can
live
here
with
you
every
summer
cornelli
oh
we
are
the
happiest
creatures
in
all
the
world
and
it
has
all
happened
through
you
cornelli
you
wonderful
incomparable
cornelli
agnes
seizing
her
friend
hand
jumped
about
with
her
in
the
room
at
such
a
rate
that
nika
had
to
calm
her
the
elder
sister
warned
agnes
that
the
director
might
have
to
repent
of
his
kindness
to
them
if
their
lengthy
stay
began
with
such
violent
noise
one
could
see
though
that
nika
was
willing
enough
to
join
the
others
in
their
antics
the
day
on
which
you
came
to
our
house
cornelli
she
said
has
really
been
more
blessed
than
any
other
day
in
the
year
so
we
must
always
celebrate
it
as
a
great
feast
day
nika
had
lately
been
very
sweet
and
friendly
to
cornelli
and
the
younger
girl
had
been
very
happy
about
it
but
had
never
dreamed
that
nika
would
ever
speak
to
her
like
this
when
esther
heard
that
the
halm
family
was
going
to
remain
for
the
present
and
return
every
year
she
said
oh
i
am
glad
that
is
much
better
than
if
some
other
people
i
know
had
to
come
back
it
is
better
for
me
and
for
cornelli
as
well
as
for
the
whole
house
oh
if
i
could
only
come
again
too
said
trina
whose
face
in
these
days
was
always
beaming
oh
one
feels
so
happy
here
that
is
very
true
esther
affirmed
i
do
not
see
why
you
should
you
do
need
to
worry
trina
if
cornelli
and
i
wish
you
well
see
that
you
come
here
again
the
director
did
not
like
the
thought
of
losing
his
large
new
family
so
soon
so
he
said
one
day
to
halm
i
am
very
anxious
to
prolong
the
children
holiday
this
year
till
late
in
the
fall
dino
who
is
more
in
need
of
his
studies
than
the
others
is
least
able
to
go
back
to
town
because
he
ought
to
be
thoroughly
strengthened
and
made
absolutely
well
if
it
should
be
necessary
for
him
to
study
we
have
our
good
maelinger
who
can
give
him
lessons
the
mother
agreed
for
she
also
was
very
anxious
to
have
dino
as
well
as
possible
and
she
was
very
grateful
to
her
benefactor
for
making
this
possible
there
is
another
reason
which
makes
a
longer
stay
necessary
continued
the
director
as
i
fully
intend
to
visit
you
and
the
children
several
times
during
the
winter
i
have
rented
a
more
comfortable
apartment
for
you
because
i
was
rather
afraid
of
finding
your
dwelling
a
little
inconvenient
for
me
the
apartment
will
be
ready
for
you
in
the
late
autumn
and
i
want
you
to
get
all
the
rest
you
can
before
you
move
there
for
it
is
sure
to
involve
some
additional
work
for
you
i
hope
sincerely
that
you
do
not
resent
my
step
i
can
only
thank
you
continually
said
the
mother
now
the
children
arrived
at
the
same
moment
and
all
further
words
from
her
were
swallowed
up
in
their
loud
and
stormy
manifestations
of
joy
cornelli
had
already
told
them
of
her
father
plan
to
let
them
all
stay
in
till
winter
time
when
all
the
fruit
had
ripened
on
the
trees
and
dino
was
shaking
one
of
them
and
cornelli
another
matthew
looked
over
from
the
barn
door
happily
rubbing
his
hands
right
under
the
tree
he
saw
the
other
children
one
biting
into
an
apple
the
other
into
a
pear
it
certainly
is
different
now
from
last
year
he
said
smiling
to
himself
there
is
not
a
rotten
plum
or
a
lonesome
pear
in
all
the
orchard
every
evening
when
the
last
songs
resounded
in
the
house
there
were
some
of
thanks
and
praise
which
rose
up
to
heaven
like
a
loud
rejoicing
more
than
once
the
director
said
to
his
little
daughter
when
she
gave
him
her
goodnight
kiss
did
not
god
mean
well
with
us
cornelli
when
he
guided
martha
to
write
such
an
inviting
notice
to
the
paper
