domestic
peace
the
incident
recorded
in
this
sketch
took
place
towards
the
end
of
the
month
of
november
the
moment
when
napoleon
s
fugitive
empire
attained
the
apogee
of
its
splendor
the
of
wagram
were
still
sounding
an
echo
in
the
heart
of
the
austrian
monarchy
peace
was
being
signed
between
france
and
the
coalition
kings
and
princes
came
to
perform
their
orbits
like
stars
round
napoleon
who
gave
himself
the
pleasure
of
dragging
all
europe
in
his
train
a
magnificent
experiment
in
the
power
he
afterwards
displayed
at
dresden
never
as
contemporaries
tell
us
did
paris
see
entertainments
more
superb
than
those
which
preceded
and
followed
the
sovereign
s
marriage
with
an
austrian
archduchess
never
in
the
most
splendid
days
of
the
monarchy
had
so
many
crowned
heads
thronged
the
shores
of
the
seine
never
had
the
french
aristocracy
been
so
rich
or
so
splendid
the
diamonds
lavishly
scattered
over
the
women
s
dresses
and
the
gold
and
silver
embroidery
on
the
uniforms
contrasted
so
strongly
with
the
penury
of
the
republic
that
the
wealth
of
the
globe
seemed
to
be
rolling
through
the
of
paris
intoxication
seemed
to
have
turned
the
brains
of
this
empire
of
a
day
all
the
military
not
excepting
their
chief
reveled
like
parvenus
in
the
treasure
conquered
for
them
by
a
million
men
with
worsted
epaulettes
whose
demands
were
satisfied
by
a
few
yards
of
red
ribbon
at
this
time
most
women
affected
that
lightness
of
conduct
and
facility
of
morals
which
distinguished
the
reign
of
louis
xv
whether
it
were
in
imitation
of
the
tone
of
the
fallen
monarchy
or
because
certain
members
of
the
imperial
family
had
set
the
example
as
certain
malcontents
of
the
faubourg
chose
to
say
it
is
certain
that
men
and
women
alike
flung
themselves
into
a
life
of
pleasure
with
an
intrepidity
which
seemed
to
forbode
the
end
of
the
world
but
there
was
at
that
time
another
cause
for
such
license
the
infatuation
of
women
for
the
military
became
a
frenzy
and
was
too
consonant
to
the
emperor
s
views
for
him
to
try
to
check
it
the
frequent
calls
to
arms
which
gave
every
treaty
concluded
between
napoleon
and
the
rest
of
europe
the
character
of
an
armistice
left
every
passion
open
to
a
termination
as
sudden
as
the
decisions
of
the
of
all
these
busbys
pelisses
and
aiguillettes
which
so
fascinated
the
fair
sex
hearts
were
as
nomadic
as
the
regiments
between
the
first
and
fifth
bulletins
from
the
a
woman
might
be
in
succession
mistress
wife
mother
and
widow
was
it
the
prospect
of
early
widowhood
the
hope
of
a
jointure
or
that
of
bearing
a
name
promised
to
history
which
made
the
soldiers
so
attractive
were
women
drawn
to
them
by
the
certainty
that
the
secret
of
their
passions
would
be
buried
on
the
field
of
battle
or
may
we
find
the
reason
of
this
gentle
fanaticism
in
the
noble
charm
that
courage
has
for
a
woman
perhaps
all
these
reasons
which
the
future
historian
of
the
manners
of
the
empire
will
no
doubt
amuse
himself
by
weighing
counted
for
something
in
their
facile
readiness
to
abandon
themselves
to
love
intrigues
be
that
as
it
may
it
must
here
be
confessed
that
at
that
time
laurels
hid
many
errors
women
showed
an
ardent
preference
for
the
brave
adventurers
whom
they
regarded
as
the
true
fount
of
honor
wealth
or
pleasure
and
in
the
eyes
of
young
girls
an
epaulette
the
hieroglyphic
of
a
future
signified
happiness
and
liberty
one
feature
and
a
characteristic
one
of
this
unique
period
in
our
history
was
an
unbridled
mania
for
everything
glittering
never
were
fireworks
so
much
in
vogue
never
were
diamonds
so
highly
prized
the
men
as
greedy
as
the
women
of
these
translucent
pebbles
displayed
them
no
less
lavishly
possibly
the
necessity
for
carrying
plunder
in
the
most
portable
form
made
gems
the
fashion
in
the
army
a
man
was
not
ridiculous
then
as
he
would
be
now
if
his
or
his
fingers
blazed
with
large
diamonds
murat
an
oriental
by
nature
set
the
example
of
preposterous
luxury
to
modern
soldiers
the
comte
de
gondreville
formerly
known
as
citizen
malin
whose
elevation
had
made
him
famous
having
become
a
lucullus
of
the
conservative
senate
which
conserved
nothing
had
postponed
an
entertainment
in
honor
of
the
peace
only
that
he
might
the
better
pay
his
court
to
napoleon
by
his
efforts
to
eclipse
those
flatterers
who
had
been
with
him
the
ambassadors
from
all
the
powers
friendly
with
france
with
an
eye
to
favors
to
come
the
most
important
personages
of
the
empire
and
even
a
few
princes
were
at
this
hour
assembled
in
the
wealthy
senator
s
dancing
flagged
every
one
was
watching
for
the
emperor
whose
presence
the
count
had
promised
his
guests
and
napoleon
would
have
kept
his
word
but
for
the
scene
which
had
broken
out
that
very
evening
between
him
and
josephine
the
scene
which
portended
the
impending
divorce
of
the
august
pair
the
report
of
this
incident
at
the
time
kept
very
secret
but
recorded
by
history
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
the
courtiers
and
had
no
effect
on
the
gaiety
of
comte
de
gondreville
s
party
beyond
keeping
napoleon
away
the
prettiest
women
in
paris
eager
to
be
at
the
count
s
on
the
strength
of
mere
hearsay
at
this
moment
were
a
besieging
force
of
luxury
coquettishness
elegance
and
beauty
the
financial
world
proud
of
its
riches
challenged
the
splendor
of
the
generals
and
high
officials
of
the
empire
so
recently
gorged
with
orders
titles
and
honors
these
grand
balls
were
always
an
opportunity
seized
upon
by
wealthy
families
for
introducing
their
heiresses
to
napoleon
s
praetorian
guard
in
the
foolish
hope
of
exchanging
their
splendid
fortunes
for
uncertain
favors
the
women
who
believed
themselves
strong
enough
in
their
beauty
alone
came
to
test
their
power
there
as
elsewhere
amusement
was
but
a
blind
calm
and
smiling
faces
and
placid
brows
covered
sordid
interests
expressions
of
friendship
were
a
lie
and
more
than
one
man
was
less
distrustful
of
his
enemies
than
of
his
friends
these
remarks
are
necessary
to
explain
the
incidents
of
the
little
imbroglio
which
is
the
subject
of
this
study
and
the
picture
softened
as
it
is
of
the
tone
then
dominant
in
paris
turn
your
eyes
a
little
towards
the
pedestal
supporting
that
candelabrum
do
you
see
a
young
lady
with
her
hair
drawn
back
la
there
in
the
corner
to
the
left
she
has
bluebells
in
the
knot
of
chestnut
curls
which
fall
in
clusters
on
her
head
do
not
you
see
her
she
is
so
pale
you
might
fancy
she
was
ill
and
very
small
there
now
she
is
turning
her
head
this
way
her
blue
eyes
so
delightfully
soft
look
as
if
they
were
made
expressly
for
tears
look
look
she
is
bending
forward
to
see
madame
de
vaudremont
below
the
crowd
of
heads
in
constant
motion
the
high
prevent
her
having
a
clear
i
see
her
now
my
dear
fellow
you
had
only
to
say
that
she
had
the
whitest
skin
of
all
the
women
here
i
should
have
known
whom
you
meant
i
had
noticed
her
before
she
has
the
loveliest
complexion
i
ever
admired
from
hence
i
defy
you
to
see
against
her
throat
the
pearls
between
the
sapphires
of
her
necklace
but
she
is
a
prude
or
a
coquette
for
the
tucker
of
her
bodice
scarcely
lets
one
suspect
the
beauty
of
her
bust
what
shoulders
what
who
is
she
asked
the
first
speaker
ah
that
i
do
not
aristocrat
do
you
want
to
keep
them
all
to
yourself
montcornet
you
of
all
men
to
banter
me
replied
montcornet
with
a
smile
do
you
think
you
have
a
right
to
insult
a
poor
general
like
me
because
being
a
happy
rival
of
soulanges
you
can
not
even
turn
on
your
heel
without
alarming
madame
de
vaudremont
or
is
it
because
i
came
only
a
month
ago
into
the
promised
land
how
insolent
you
can
be
you
men
in
office
who
sit
glued
to
your
chairs
while
we
are
dodging
shot
and
shell
come
monsieur
le
maitre
des
requetes
allow
us
to
glean
in
the
field
of
which
you
can
only
have
precarious
possession
from
the
moment
when
we
evacuate
it
the
deuce
is
in
it
we
have
a
right
to
live
my
good
friend
if
you
knew
the
german
women
you
would
i
believe
do
me
a
good
turn
with
the
parisian
you
love
well
general
since
you
have
vouchsafed
to
turn
your
attention
to
that
lady
whom
i
never
saw
till
now
have
the
charity
to
tell
me
if
you
have
seen
her
why
my
dear
martial
where
have
you
dropped
from
if
you
are
ever
sent
with
an
embassy
i
have
small
hopes
of
your
success
do
not
you
see
a
triple
rank
of
the
most
undaunted
coquettes
of
paris
between
her
and
the
swarm
of
dancing
men
that
buzz
under
the
chandelier
and
was
it
not
only
by
the
help
of
your
eyeglass
that
you
were
able
to
discover
her
at
all
in
the
corner
by
that
pillar
where
she
seems
buried
in
the
gloom
in
spite
of
the
candles
blazing
above
her
head
between
her
and
us
there
is
such
a
sparkle
of
diamonds
and
glances
so
many
floating
plumes
such
a
flutter
of
lace
of
flowers
and
curls
that
it
would
be
a
real
miracle
if
any
dancer
could
detect
her
among
those
stars
why
martial
how
is
it
that
you
have
not
understood
her
to
be
the
wife
of
some
from
lippe
or
dyle
who
has
come
to
try
to
get
her
husband
promoted
oh
he
will
be
exclaimed
the
master
of
appeals
quickly
i
doubt
it
replied
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
laughing
she
seems
as
raw
in
intrigue
as
you
are
in
diplomacy
i
dare
bet
martial
that
you
do
not
know
how
she
got
into
that
the
lawyer
looked
at
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
with
an
expression
as
much
of
contempt
as
of
curiosity
well
proceeded
montcornet
she
arrived
i
have
no
doubt
punctually
at
nine
the
first
of
the
company
perhaps
and
probably
she
greatly
embarrassed
the
comtesse
de
gondreville
who
can
not
put
two
ideas
together
repulsed
by
the
mistress
of
the
house
routed
from
chair
to
chair
by
each
newcomer
and
driven
into
the
darkness
of
this
little
corner
she
allowed
herself
to
be
walled
in
the
victim
of
the
jealousy
of
the
other
ladies
who
would
gladly
have
buried
that
dangerous
beauty
she
had
of
course
no
friend
to
encourage
her
to
maintain
the
place
she
first
held
in
the
front
rank
then
each
of
those
treacherous
fair
ones
would
have
enjoined
on
the
men
of
her
circle
on
no
account
to
take
out
our
poor
friend
under
pain
of
the
severest
punishment
that
my
dear
fellow
is
the
way
in
which
those
sweet
faces
in
appearance
so
tender
and
so
artless
would
have
formed
a
coalition
against
the
stranger
and
that
without
a
word
beyond
the
question
tell
me
dear
do
you
know
that
little
woman
in
blue
look
here
martial
if
you
care
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
more
flattering
glances
and
inviting
questions
than
you
will
ever
again
meet
in
the
whole
of
your
life
just
try
to
get
through
the
triple
rampart
which
defends
that
queen
of
dyle
or
lippe
or
charente
you
will
see
whether
the
dullest
woman
of
them
all
will
not
be
equal
to
inventing
some
wile
that
would
hinder
the
most
determined
man
from
bringing
the
plaintive
stranger
to
the
light
does
it
not
strike
you
that
she
looks
like
an
elegy
do
you
think
so
montcornet
then
she
must
be
a
married
woman
why
not
a
widow
she
would
be
less
passive
said
the
lawyer
laughing
she
is
perhaps
the
widow
of
a
man
who
is
gambling
replied
the
handsome
colonel
to
be
sure
since
the
peace
there
are
so
many
widows
of
that
class
said
martial
but
my
dear
montcornet
we
are
a
couple
of
simpletons
that
face
is
still
too
ingenuous
there
is
too
much
youth
and
freshness
on
the
brow
and
temples
for
her
to
be
married
what
splendid
nothing
has
sunk
in
the
modeling
of
the
nose
lips
chin
everything
in
her
face
is
as
fresh
as
a
white
rosebud
though
the
expression
is
veiled
as
it
were
by
the
clouds
of
sadness
who
can
it
be
that
makes
that
young
creature
weep
women
cry
for
so
little
said
the
colonel
i
do
not
know
replied
martial
but
she
does
not
cry
because
she
is
left
there
without
a
partner
her
grief
is
not
of
it
is
evident
that
she
has
beautified
herself
for
this
evening
with
intention
i
would
wager
that
she
is
in
love
bah
she
is
perhaps
the
daughter
of
some
german
princeling
no
one
talks
to
her
said
montcornet
dear
how
unhappy
a
poor
child
may
be
martial
went
on
can
there
be
anything
more
graceful
and
refined
than
our
little
stranger
well
not
one
of
those
furies
who
stand
round
her
and
who
believe
that
they
can
feel
will
say
a
word
to
her
if
she
would
but
speak
we
should
see
if
she
has
fine
teeth
bless
me
you
boil
over
like
milk
at
the
least
increase
of
temperature
cried
the
colonel
a
little
nettled
at
so
soon
finding
a
rival
in
his
friend
what
exclaimed
the
lawyer
without
heeding
the
colonel
s
question
can
nobody
here
tell
us
the
name
of
this
exotic
flower
some
lady
companion
said
montcornet
what
next
a
companion
wearing
sapphires
fit
for
a
queen
and
a
dress
of
malines
lace
tell
that
to
the
marines
general
you
too
would
not
shine
in
diplomacy
if
in
the
course
of
your
conjectures
you
jump
in
a
breath
from
a
german
princess
to
a
lady
montcornet
stopped
a
man
by
taking
his
arm
a
fat
little
man
whose
hair
and
clever
eyes
were
to
be
seen
at
the
lintel
of
every
doorway
and
who
mingled
unceremoniously
with
the
various
groups
which
welcomed
him
respectfully
gondreville
my
friend
said
montcornet
who
is
that
quite
charming
little
woman
sitting
out
there
under
that
huge
candelabrum
the
candelabrum
ravrio
s
work
isabey
made
the
oh
i
recognized
your
lavishness
and
taste
but
the
lady
ah
i
do
not
know
some
friend
of
my
wife
s
no
or
your
mistress
you
old
no
on
my
honor
the
comtesse
de
gondreville
is
the
only
person
capable
of
inviting
people
whom
no
one
in
spite
of
this
very
acrimonious
comment
the
fat
little
man
s
lips
did
not
lose
the
smile
which
the
colonel
s
suggestion
had
brought
to
them
montcornet
returned
to
the
lawyer
who
had
rejoined
a
neighboring
group
intent
on
asking
but
in
vain
for
information
as
to
the
fair
unknown
he
grasped
martial
s
arm
and
said
in
his
ear
my
dear
martial
mind
what
you
are
about
madame
de
vaudremont
has
been
watching
you
for
some
minutes
with
ominous
attentiveness
she
is
a
woman
who
can
guess
by
the
mere
movement
of
your
lips
what
you
say
to
me
our
eyes
have
already
told
her
too
much
she
has
perceived
and
followed
their
direction
and
i
suspect
that
at
this
moment
she
is
thinking
even
more
than
we
are
of
the
little
blue
that
is
too
old
a
trick
in
warfare
my
dear
montcornet
however
what
do
i
care
like
the
emperor
when
i
have
made
a
conquest
i
keep
martial
your
fatuity
cries
out
for
a
lesson
what
you
a
civilian
and
so
lucky
as
to
be
the
of
madame
de
vaudremont
a
widow
of
burdened
with
four
thousand
napoleons
a
year
a
woman
who
slips
such
a
diamond
as
this
on
your
finger
he
added
taking
the
lawyer
s
left
hand
which
the
young
man
complacently
allowed
and
to

all

lovelace
just
as
if
you
were

keep
up
the

home
quarters
fie

only
think
of
all
you
may
at
any
rate
i
shall
not
lose
my
liberty
replied
martial
with
a
forced
laugh
he
cast
a
passionate
glance
at
madame
de
vaudremont
who
responded
only
by
a
smile
of
some
uneasiness
for
she
had
seen
the
colonel
examining
the
lawyer
s
ring
listen
to
me
martial
if
you
flutter
round
my
young
stranger
i
shall
set
to
work
to
win
madame

you
have
my
full
permission
my
dear
cuirassier
but
you
will
not
gain
this
much
and
the
young
maitre

requetes
put
his
polished
under
an
upper
tooth
with
a
little
mocking
click
remember
that
i
am
unmarried
said
the
colonel
that
my
sword
is
my
whole
fortune
and
that
such
a
challenge
is
setting
tantalus
down
to
a
banquet
which
he
will
this
defiant
roll
of
consonants
was
the
only
reply
to
the
colonel
s
declaration
as
martial
looked
him
from
head
to
foot
before
turning
away
the
fashion
of
the
time
required
men
to
wear
at
a
ball
white
kerseymere
breeches
and
silk
stockings
this
pretty
costume
showed
to
great
advantage
the
perfection
of
montcornet
s
fine
shape
he
was
and
attracted
attention
by
his
stalwart
height
insisted
on
for
the
cuirassiers
of
the
imperial
guard
whose
handsome
uniform
enhanced
the
dignity
of
his
figure
still
youthful
in
spite
of
the
stoutness
occasioned
by
living
on
horseback
a
black
moustache
emphasized
the
frank
expression
of
a
thoroughly
soldierly
countenance
with
a
broad
high
forehead
an
aquiline
nose
and
bright
red
lips
montcornet
s
manner
stamped
with
a
certain
superiority
due
to
the
habit
of
command
might
please
a
woman
sensible
enough
not
to
aim
at
making
a
slave
of
her
husband
the
colonel
smiled
as
he
looked
at
the
lawyer
one
of
his
favorite
college
friends
whose
small
figure
made
it
necessary
for
montcornet
to
look
down
a
little
as
he
answered
his
raillery
with
a
friendly
glance
baron
martial
de
la
was
a
young
provencal
patronized
by
napoleon
his
fate
might
probably
be
some
splendid
embassy
he
had
won
the
emperor
by
his
italian
suppleness
and
a
genius
for
intrigue
a
eloquence
and
a
knowledge
of
manners
which
are
so
good
a
substitute
for
the
higher
qualities
of
a
sterling
man
through
young
and
eager
his
face
had
already
acquired
the
rigid
brilliancy
of
tinned
iron
one
of
the
indispensable
characteristics
of
diplomatists
which
allows
them
to
conceal
their
emotions
and
disguise
their
feelings
unless
indeed
this
impassibility
indicates
an
absence
of
all
emotion
and
the
death
of
every
feeling
the
heart
of
a
diplomate
may
be
regarded
as
an
insoluble
problem
for
the
three
most
illustrious
ambassadors
of
the
time
have
been
distinguished
by
perdurable
hatreds
and
most
romantic
attachments
martial
however
was
one
of
those
men
who
are
capable
of
reckoning
on
the
future
in
the
midst
of
their
intensest
enjoyment
he
had
already
learned
to
judge
the
world
and
hid
his
ambition
under
the
fatuity
of
a
cloaking
his
talent
under
the
commonplace
of
mediocrity
as
soon
as
he
observed
the
rapid
advancement
of
those
men
who
gave
the
master
little
umbrage
the
two
friends
now
had
to
part
with
a
cordial
grasp
of
hands
the
introductory
tune
warning
the
ladies
to
form
in
squares
for
a
fresh
quadrille
cleared
the
men
away
from
the
space
they
had
filled
while
talking
in
the
middle
of
the
large
room
this
hurried
dialogue
had
taken
place
during
the
usual
interval
between
two
dances
in
front
of
the
fireplace
of
the
great
of
gondreville
s
mansion
the
questions
and
answers
of
this
very
ordinary
ballroom
gossip
had
been
almost
whispered
by
each
of
the
speakers
into
his
neighbor
s
ear
at
the
same
time
the
chandeliers
and
the
flambeaux
on
the
shed
such
a
flood
of
light
on
the
two
friends
that
their
faces
strongly
illuminated
failed
in
spite
of
their
diplomatic
discretion
to
conceal
the
faint
expression
of
their
feelings
either
from
the
countess
or
the
artless
stranger
this
espionage
of
people
s
thoughts
is
perhaps
to
idle
persons
one
of
the
pleasures
they
find
in
society
while
numbers
of
disappointed
numskulls
are
bored
there
without
daring
to
own
it
fully
to
appreciate
the
interest
of
this
conversation
it
is
necessary
to
relate
an
incident
which
would
presently
serve
as
an
invisible
bond
drawing
together
the
actors
in
this
little
drama
who
were
at
present
scattered
through
the
rooms
at
about
eleven
o
clock
just
as
the
dancers
were
returning
to
their
seats
the
company
had
observed
the
entrance
of
the
handsomest
woman
in
paris
the
queen
of
fashion
the
only
person
wanting
to
the
brilliant
assembly
she
made
it
a
rule
never
to
appear
till
the
moment
when
a
party
had
reached
that
pitch
of
excited
movement
which
does
not
allow
the
women
to
preserve
much
longer
the
freshness
of
their
faces
or
of
their
dress
this
brief
hour
is
as
it
were
the
springtime
of
a
ball
an
hour
after
when
pleasure
falls
flat
and
fatigue
is
encroaching
everything
is
spoilt
madame
de
vaudremont
never
committed
the
blunder
of
remaining
at
a
party
to
be
seen
with
drooping
flowers
hair
out
of
curl
tumbled
frills
and
a
face
like
every
other
that
sleep
is
courting
not
always
without
success
she
took
good
care
not
to
let
her
beauty
be
seen
drowsy
as
her
rivals
did
she
was
so
clever
as
to
keep
up
her
reputation
for
smartness
by
always
leaving
a
ballroom
in
brilliant
order
as
she
had
entered
it
women
whispered
to
each
other
with
a
feeling
of
envy
that
she
planned
and
wore
as
many
different
dresses
as
the
parties
she
went
to
in
one
evening
on
the
present
occasion
madame
de
vaudremont
was
not
destined
to
be
free
to
leave
when
she
would
the
ballroom
she
had
entered
in
triumph
pausing
for
a
moment
on
the
threshold
she
shot
swift
but
observant
glances
on
the
women
present
hastily
scrutinizing
their
dresses
to
assure
herself
that
her
own
eclipsed
them
all
the
illustrious
beauty
presented
herself
to
the
admiration
of
the
crowd
at
the
same
moment
with
one
of
the
bravest
colonels
of
the
guards
artillery
and
the
emperor
s
favorite
the
comte
de
soulanges
the
transient
and
fortuitous
association
of
these
two
had
about
it
a
certain
air
of
mystery
on
hearing
the
names
announced
of
monsieur
de
soulanges
and
the
comtesse
de
vaudremont
a
few
women
sitting
by
the
wall
rose
and
men
hurrying
in
from
the
pressed
forward
to
the
principal
doorway
one
of
the
jesters
who
are
always
to
be
found
in
any
large
assembly
said
as
the
countess
and
her
escort
came
in
that
women
had
quite
as
much
curiosity
about
seeing
a
man
who
was
faithful
to
his
passion
as
men
had
in
studying
a
woman
who
was
difficult
to
though
the
comte
de
soulanges
a
young
man
of
about
was
endowed
with
the
nervous
temperament
which
in
a
man
gives
rise
to
fine
qualities
his
slender
build
and
pale
complexion
were
not
at
first
sight
attractive
his
black
eyes
betrayed
great
vivacity
but
he
was
taciturn
in
company
and
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
to
reveal
the
gift
for
oratory
which
subsequently
distinguished
him
on
the
right
in
the
legislative
assembly
under
the
restoration
the
comtesse
de
vaudremont
a
tall
woman
rather
fat
with
a
skin
of
dazzling
whiteness
a
small
head
that
she
carried
well
and
the
immense
advantage
of
inspiring
love
by
the
graciousness
of
her
manner
was
one
of
those
beings
who
keep
all
the
promise
of
their
beauty
the
pair
who
for
a
few
minutes
were
the
centre
of
general
observation
did
not
for
long
give
curiosity
an
opportunity
of
exercising
itself
about
them
the
colonel
and
the
countess
seemed
perfectly
to
understand
that
accident
had
placed
them
in
an
awkward
position
martial
as
they
came
forward
had
hastened
to
join
the
group
of
men
by
the
fireplace
that
he
might
watch
madame
de
vaudremont
with
the
jealous
anxiety
of
the
first
flame
of
passion
from
behind
the
heads
which
formed
a
sort
of
rampart
a
secret
voice
seemed
to
warn
him
that
the
success
on
which
he
prided
himself
might
perhaps
be
precarious
but
the
coldly
polite
smile
with
which
the
countess
thanked
monsieur
de
soulanges
and
her
little
bow
of
dismissal
as
she
sat
down
by
madame
de
gondreville
relaxed
the
muscles
of
his
face
which
jealousy
had
made
rigid
seeing
soulanges
however
still
standing
quite
near
the
sofa
on
which
madame
de
vaudremont
was
seated
not
apparently
having
understood
the
glance
by
which
the
lady
had
conveyed
to
him
that
they
were
both
playing
a
ridiculous
part
the
volcanic
provencal
again
knit
the
black
brows
that
overshadowed
his
blue
eyes
smoothed
his
chestnut
curls
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
and
without
betraying
the
agitation
which
made
his
heart
beat
watched
the
faces
of
the
countess
and
of
de
soulanges
while
still
chatting
with
his
neighbors
he
then
took
the
hand
of
colonel
montcornet
who
had
just
renewed
their
old
acquaintance
but
he
listened
to
him
without
hearing
him
his
mind
was
elsewhere
soulanges
was
gazing
calmly
at
the
women
sitting
four
ranks
deep
all
round
the
immense
ballroom
admiring
this
dado
of
diamonds
rubies
masses
of
gold
and
shining
hair
of
which
the
lustre
almost
outshone
the
blaze
of
waxlights
the
cutglass
of
the
chandeliers
and
the
gilding
his
rival
s
stolid
indifference
put
the
lawyer
out
of
countenance
quite
incapable
of
controlling
his
secret
transports
of
impatience
martial
went
towards
madame
de
vaudremont
with
a
bow
on
seeing
the
provencal
soulanges
gave
him
a
covert
glance
and
impertinently
turned
away
his
head
solemn
silence
now
reigned
in
the
room
where
curiosity
was
at
the
highest
pitch
all
these
eager
faces
wore
the
strangest
mixed
expressions
every
one
apprehended
one
of
those
outbreaks
which
men
of
breeding
carefully
avoid
suddenly
the
count
s
pale
face
turned
as
red
as
the
scarlet
facings
of
his
coat
and
he
fixed
his
gaze
on
the
floor
that
the
cause
of
his
agitation
might
not
be
guessed
on
catching
sight
of
the
unknown
lady
humbly
seated
by
the
pedestal
of
the
candelabrum
he
moved
away
with
a
melancholy
air
passing
in
front
of
the
lawyer
and
took
refuge
in
one
of
the
cardrooms
martial
and
all
the
company
thought
that
soulanges
had
publicly
surrendered
the
post
out
of
fear
of
the
ridicule
which
invariably
attaches
to
a
discarded
lover
the
lawyer
proudly
raised
his
head
and
looked
at
the
strange
lady
then
as
he
took
his
seat
at
his
ease
near
madame
de
vaudremont
he
listened
to
her
so
inattentively
that
he
did
not
catch
these
words
spoken
behind
her
fan
martial
you
will
oblige
me
this
evening
by
not
wearing
that
ring
that
you
snatched
from
me
i
have
my
reasons
and
will
explain
them
to
you
in
a
moment
when
we
go
away
you
must
give
me
your
arm
to
go
to
the
princess
de
wagram
why
did
you
come
in
with
the
colonel
asked
the
baron
i
met
him
in
the
hall
she
replied
but
leave
me
now
everybody
is
looking
at
martial
returned
to
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
then
it
was
that
the
little
blue
lady
had
become
the
object
of
the
curiosity
which
agitated
in
such
various
ways
the
colonel
soulanges
martial
and
madame
de
vaudremont
when
the
friends
parted
after
the
challenge
which
closed
their
conversation
the
baron
flew
to
madame
de
vaudremont
and
led
her
to
a
place
in
the
most
brilliant
quadrille
favored
by
the
sort
of
intoxication
which
dancing
always
produces
in
a
woman
and
by
the
turmoil
of
a
ball
where
men
appear
in
all
the
trickery
of
dress
which
adds
no
less
to
their
attractions
than
it
does
to
those
of
women
martial
thought
he
might
yield
with
impunity
to
the
charm
that
attracted
his
gaze
to
the
fair
stranger
though
he
succeeded
in
hiding
his
first
glances
towards
the
lady
in
blue
from
the
anxious
activity
of
the
countess
eyes
he
was
ere
long
caught
in
the
fact
and
though
he
managed
to
excuse
himself
once
for
his
absence
of
mind
he
could
not
justify
the
unseemly
silence
with
which
he
presently
heard
the
most
insinuating
question
which
a
woman
can
put
to
a
man
do
you
like
me
very
much
this
evening
and
the
more
dreamy
he
became
the
more
the
countess
pressed
and
teased
him
while
martial
was
dancing
the
colonel
moved
from
group
to
group
seeking
information
about
the
unknown
lady
after
exhausting
the
even
of
the
most
indifferent
he
had
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
a
moment
when
the
comtesse
de
gondreville
seemed
to
be
at
liberty
to
ask
her
the
name
of
the
mysterious
lady
when
he
perceived
a
little
space
left
clear
between
the
pedestal
of
the
candelabrum
and
the
two
sofas
which
ended
in
that
corner
the
dance
had
left
several
of
the
chairs
vacant
which
formed
rows
of
fortifications
held
by
mothers
or
women
of
middle
age
and
the
colonel
seized
the
opportunity
to
make
his
way
through
this
palisade
hung
with
shawls
and
wraps
he
began
by
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
dowagers
and
so
from
one
to
another
and
from
compliment
to
compliment
he
at
last
reached
the
empty
space
next
the
stranger
at
the
risk
of
catching
on
to
the
gryphons
and
chimaeras
of
the
huge
candelabrum
he
stood
there
braving
the
glare
and
dropping
of
the
wax
candles
to
martial
s
extreme
annoyance
the
colonel
far
too
tactful
to
speak
suddenly
to
the
little
blue
lady
on
his
right
began
by
saying
to
a
plain
woman
who
was
seated
on
the
left
this
is
a
splendid
ball
madame
what
luxury
what
life
on
my
word
every
woman
here
is
pretty
you
are
not
dancing
because
you
do
not
care
for
it
no
this
vapid
conversation
was
solely
intended
to
induce
his
neighbor
to
speak
but
she
silent
and
paid
not
the
least
attention
the
officer
had
in
store
a
number
of
phrases
which
he
intended
should
lead
up
to
and
you
madame
a
question
from
which
he
hoped
great
things
but
he
was
strangely
surprised
to
see
tears
in
the
strange
lady
s
eyes
which
seemed
wholly
absorbed
in
gazing
on
madame
de
vaudremont
you
are
married
no
doubt
madame
he
asked
her
at
length
in
hesitating
tones
yes
monsieur
replied
the
lady
and
your
husband
is
here
of
course
yes
and
why
madame
do
you
remain
in
this
spot
is
it
to
attract
attention
the
mournful
lady
smiled
sadly
allow
me
the
honor
madame
of
being
your
partner
in
the
next
quadrille
and
i
will
take
care
not
to
bring
you
back
here
i
see
a
vacant
settee
near
the
fire
come
and
take
it
when
so
many
people
are
ready
to
ascend
the
throne
and
royalty
is
the
mania
of
the
day
i
can
not
imagine
that
you
will
refuse
the
title
of
queen
of
the
ball
which
your
beauty
may
i
do
not
intend
to
dance
the
curt
tone
of
the
lady
s
replies
was
so
discouraging
that
the
colonel
found
himself
compelled
to
raise
the
siege
martial
who
guessed
what
the
officer
s
last
request
had
been
and
the
refusal
he
had
met
with
began
to
smile
and
stroked
his
chin
making
the
diamond
sparkle
which
he
wore
on
his
finger
what
are
you
laughing
at
said
the
comtesse
de
vaudremont
at
the
failure
of
the
poor
colonel
who
has
just
put
his
foot
in
it
i
begged
you
to
take
your
ring
off
said
the
countess
interrupting
him
i
did
not
hear
if
you
can
hear
nothing
this
evening
at
any
rate
you
see
everything
monsieur
le
baron
said
madame
de
vaudremont
with
an
air
of
vexation
that
young
man
is
displaying
a
very
fine
diamond
the
stranger
remarked
to
the
colonel
splendid
he
replied
the
man

de
la
one
of
my
most
intimate
i
have
to
thank
you
for
telling
me
his
name
she
went
on
he
seems
an
agreeable
yes
but
he
is
rather
he
seems
to
be
on
the
best
terms
with
the
comtesse
de
vaudremont
said
the
lady
with
an
inquiring
look
at
the
colonel
on
the
very
the
unknown
turned
pale
hallo
thought
the
soldier
she
is
in
love
with
that
lucky
devil
i
fancied
that
madame
de
vaudremont
had
long
been
devoted
to
de
soulanges
said
the
lady
recovering
a
little
from
the
suppressed
grief
which
had
clouded
the
fairness
of
her
face
for
a
week
past
the
countess
has
been
faithless
replied
the
colonel
but
you
must
have
seen
poor
soulanges
when
he
came
in
he
is
till
trying
to
disbelieve
in
his
yes
i
saw
him
said
the
lady
then
she
added
thank
you
very
much
monsieur
in
a
tone
which
signified
a
dismissal
at
this
moment
the
quadrille
was
coming
to
an
end
montcornet
had
only
time
to
withdraw
saying
to
himself
by
way
of
consolation
she
is
well
valiant
cuirassier
exclaimed
the
baron
drawing
the
colonel
aside
into
a
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
from
the
garden
how
are
you
getting
on
she
is
a
married
woman
my
dear
what
does
that
matter
oh
deuce
take
it
i
am
a
decent
sort
of
man
replied
the
colonel
i
have
no
idea
of
paying
my
addresses
to
a
woman
i
can
not
marry
besides
martial
she
expressly
told
me
that
she
did
not
intend
to
colonel
i
will
bet
a
hundred
napoleons
to
your
gray
horse
that
she
will
dance
with
me
this
done
said
the
colonel
putting
his
hand
in
the
coxcomb
s
meanwhile
i
am
going
to
look
for
soulanges
he
perhaps
knows
the
lady
as
she
seems
interested
in
you
have
lost
my
good
fellow
cried
martial
laughing
my
eyes
have
met
hers
and
i
know
what
they
mean
my
dear
friend
you
owe
me
no
grudge
for
dancing
with
her
after
she
has
refused
you
no
no
those
who
laugh
last
laugh
longest
but
i
am
an
honest
gambler
and
a
generous
enemy
martial
and
i
warn
you
she
is
fond
of
with
these
words
the
friends
parted
general
montcornet
made
his
way
to
the
cardroom
where
he
saw
the
comte
de
soulanges
sitting
at
a
table
though
there
was
no
friendship
between
the
two
soldiers
beyond
the
superficial
comradeship
arising
from
the
perils
of
war
and
the
duties
of
the
service
the
colonel
of
cuirassiers
was
painfully
struck
by
seeing
the
colonel
of
artillery
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
prudent
man
playing
at
a
game
which
might
bring
him
to
ruin
the
heaps
of
gold
and
notes
piled
on
the
fateful
cards
showed
the
frenzy
of
play
a
circle
of
silent
men
stood
round
the
players
at
the
table
now
and
then
a
few
words
were
spoken
play
i
stop
a
thousand
louis
but
looking
at
the
five
motionless
men
it
seemed
as
though
they
talked
only
with
their
eyes
as
the
colonel
alarmed
by
soulanges
pallor
went
up
to
him
the
count
was
winning
the
duc
d
isemberg
keller
and
a
famous
banker
rose
from
the
table
completely
cleaned
out
of
considerable
sums
soulanges
looked
gloomier
than
ever
as
he
swept
up
a
quantity
of
gold
and
notes
he
did
not
even
count
it
his
lips
curled
with
bitter
scorn
he
seemed
to
defy
fortune
rather
than
be
grateful
for
her
favors
courage
said
the
colonel
courage
soulanges
then
believing
he
would
do
him
a
service
by
dragging
him
from
play
he
added
come
with
me
i
have
some
good
news
for
you
but
on
one
what
is
that
asked
soulanges
that
you
will
answer
a
question
i
will
ask
the
comte
de
soulanges
rose
abruptly
placing
his
winnings
with
reckless
indifference
in
his
handkerchief
which
he
had
been
twisting
with
convulsive
nervousness
and
his
expression
was
so
savage
that
none
of
the
players
took
exception
to
his
walking
off
with
their
money
indeed
every
face
seemed
to
dilate
with
relief
when
his
morose
and
crabbed
countenance
was
no
longer
to
be
seen
under
the
circle
of
light
which
a
shaded
lamp
casts
on
a
those
fiends
of
soldiers
are
always
as
thick
as
thieves
at
a
fair
said
a
diplomate
who
had
been
looking
on
as
he
took
soulanges
place
one
single
pallid
and
fatigued
face
turned
to
the
newcomer
and
said
with
a
glance
that
flashed
and
died
out
like
the
sparkle
of
a
diamond
when
we
say
military
men
we
do
not
mean
civil
monsieur
le
my
dear
fellow
said
montcornet
to
soulanges
leading
him
into
a
corner
the
emperor
spoke
warmly
in
your
praise
this
morning
and
your
promotion
to
be
is
a
the
master
does
not
love
the
no
but
he
adores
the
nobility
and
you
are
an
aristocrat
the
master
said
added
montcornet
that
the
men
who
had
married
in
paris
during
the
campaign
were
not
therefore
to
be
considered
in
disgrace
well
then
the
comte
de
soulanges
looked
as
if
he
understood
nothing
of
this
speech
and
now
i
hope
the
colonel
went
on
that
you
will
tell
me
if
you
know
a
charming
little
woman
who
is
sitting
under
a
huge
candelabrum
at
these
words
the
count
s
face
lighted
up
he
violently
seized
the
colonel
s
hand
my
dear
general
said
he
in
a
perceptibly
altered
voice
if
any
man
but
you
had
asked
me
such
a
question
i
would
have
cracked
his
skull
with
this
mass
of
gold
leave
me
i
entreat
you
i
feel
more
like
blowing
out
my
brains
this
evening
i
assure
you
than
i
hate
everything
i
see
and
in
fact
i
am
going
this
gaiety
this
music
these
stupid
faces
all
laughing
are
killing
me
my
poor
friend
replied
montcornet
gently
and
giving
the
count
s
hand
a
friendly
pressure
you
are
too
vehement
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
martial
is
thinking
so
little
of
madame
de
vaudremont
that
he
is
quite
smitten
with
that
little
lady
if
he
says
a
word
to
her
cried
soulanges
stammering
with
rage
i
will
thrash
him
as
flat
as
his
own
portfolio
even
if
the
coxcomb
were
in
the
emperor
s
lap
and
he
sank
quite
overcome
on
an
to
which
montcornet
had
led
him
the
colonel
slowly
went
away
for
he
perceived
that
soulanges
was
in
a
state
of
fury
far
too
violent
for
the
pleasantries
or
the
attentions
of
superficial
friendship
to
soothe
him
when
montcornet
returned
to
the
ballroom
madame
de
vaudremont
was
the
first
person
on
whom
his
eyes
fell
and
he
observed
on
her
face
usually
so
calm
some
symptoms
of
agitation
a
chair
was
vacant
near
hers
and
the
colonel
seated
himself
i
dare
wager
something
has
vexed
you
said
he
a
mere
trifle
general
i
want
to
be
gone
for
i
have
promised
to
go
to
a
ball
at
the
grand
duchess
of
berg
s
and
i
must
look
in
first
at
the
princesse
de
wagram
s
monsieur
de
la
who
knows
this
is
amusing
himself
by
flirting
with
the
that
is
not
the
whole
secret
of
your
disturbance
and
i
will
bet
a
hundred
louis
that
you
will
remain
here
the
whole
impertinent
man
then
i
have
hit
the
truth
well
tell
me
what
am
i
thinking
of
said
the
countess
tapping
the
colonel
s
fingers
with
her
fan
i
might
even
reward
you
if
you
guess
i
will
not
accept
the
challenge
i
have
too
much
the
advantage
of
you
are
you
are
afraid
of
seeing
martial
at
the
feet
of
whom
cried
the
countess
affecting
surprise
of
that
candelabrum
replied
the
colonel
glancing
at
the
fair
stranger
and
then
looking
at
the
countess
with
embarrassing
scrutiny
you
have
guessed
it
replied
the
coquette
hiding
her
face
behind
her
fan
which
she
began
to
play
with
old
madame
de
lansac
who
is
you
know
as
malicious
as
an
old
monkey
she
went
on
after
a
pause
has
just
told
me
that
monsieur
de
la
is
running
into
danger
by
flirting
with
that
stranger
who
sits
here
this
evening
like
a
skeleton
at
a
feast
i
would
rather
see
a
death
s
head
than
that
face
so
cruelly
beautiful
and
as
pale
as
a
ghost
she
is
my
evil
madame
de
lansac
she
added
after
a
flash
and
gesture
of
annoyance
who
only
goes
to
a
ball
to
watch
everything
while
pretending
to
sleep
has
made
me
miserably
anxious
martial
shall
pay
dearly
for
playing
me
such
a
trick
urge
him
meanwhile
since
he
is
your
friend
not
to
make
me
so
i
have
just
been
with
a
man
who
promises
to
blow
his
brains
out
and
nothing
less
if
he
speaks
to
that
little
lady
and
he
is
a
man
madame
to
keep
his
word
but
then
i
know
martial
such
threats
are
to
him
an
encouragement
and
besides
we
have
wagered
here
the
colonel
lowered
his
voice
can
it
be
true
said
the
countess
on
my
word
of
thank
you
my
dear
colonel
replied
madame
de
vaudremont
with
a
glance
full
of
invitation
will
you
do
me
the
honor
of
dancing
with
me
yes
but
the
next
quadrille
during
this
one
i
want
to
find
out
what
will
come
of
this
little
intrigue
and
to
ascertain
who
the
little
blue
lady
may
be
she
looks
the
colonel
understanding
that
madame
de
vaudremont
wished
to
be
alone
retired
well
content
to
have
begun
his
attack
so
well
at
most
entertainments
women
are
to
be
met
who
are
there
like
madame
de
lansac
as
old
sailors
gather
on
the
seashore
to
watch
younger
mariners
struggling
with
the
tempest
at
this
moment
madame
de
lansac
who
seemed
to
be
interested
in
the
personages
of
this
drama
could
easily
guess
the
agitation
which
the
countess
was
going
through
the
lady
might
fan
herself
gracefully
smile
on
the
young
men
who
bowed
to
her
and
bring
into
play
all
the
arts
by
which
a
woman
hides
her
emotion
the
dowager
one
of
the
most
and
duchesses
bequeathed
by
the
eighteenth
century
to
the
nineteenth
could
read
her
heart
and
mind
through
it
all
the
old
lady
seemed
to
detect
the
slightest
movement
that
revealed
the
impressions
of
the
soul
the
imperceptible
frown
that
furrowed
that
calm
pure
forehead
the
faintest
quiver
of
the
cheeks
the
curve
of
the
eyebrows
the
least
curl
of
the
lips
whose
living
coral
could
conceal
nothing
from
her
all
these
were
to
the
duchess
like
the
print
of
a
book
from
the
depths
of
her
large
completely
filled
by
the
flow
of
her
dress
the
coquette
of
the
past
while
talking
to
a
diplomate
who
had
sought
her
out
to
hear
the
anecdotes
she
told
so
cleverly
was
admiring
herself
in
the
younger
coquette
she
felt
kindly
to
her
seeing
how
bravely
she
disguised
her
annoyance
and
grief
of
heart
madame
de
vaudremont
in
fact
felt
as
much
sorrow
as
she
feigned
cheerfulness
she
had
believed
that
she
had
found
in
martial
a
man
of
talent
on
whose
support
she
could
count
for
adorning
her
life
with
all
the
enchantment
of
power
and
at
this
moment
she
perceived
her
mistake
as
injurious
to
her
reputation
as
to
her
good
opinion
of
herself
in
her
as
in
other
women
of
that
time
the
suddenness
of
their
passions
increased
their
vehemence
souls
which
love
much
and
love
often
suffer
no
less
than
those
which
burn
themselves
out
in
one
affection
her
liking
for
martial
was
but
of
yesterday
it
is
true
but
the
least
experienced
surgeon
knows
that
the
pain
caused
by
the
amputation
of
a
healthy
limb
is
more
acute
than
the
removal
of
a
diseased
one
there
was
a
future
before
madame
de
vaudremont
s
passion
for
martial
while
her
previous
love
had
been
hopeless
and
poisoned
by
soulanges
remorse
the
old
duchess
who
was
watching
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
the
countess
hastened
to
dismiss
her
ambassador
for
in
comparison
with
a
lover
s
quarrel
every
interest
pales
even
with
an
old
woman
to
engage
battle
madame
de
lansac
shot
at
the
younger
lady
a
sardonic
glance
which
made
the
countess
fear
lest
her
fate
was
in
the
dowager
s
hands
there
are
looks
between
woman
and
woman
which
are
like
the
torches
brought
on
at
the
climax
of
a
tragedy
no
one
who
had
not
known
that
duchess
could
appreciate
the
terror
which
the
expression
of
her
countenance
inspired
in
the
countess
madame
de
lansac
was
tall
and
her
features
led
people
to
say
that
must
have
been
a
handsome
woman
she
coated
her
cheeks
so
thickly
with
rouge
that
the
wrinkles
were
scarcely
visible
but
her
eyes
far
from
gaining
a
factitious
brilliancy
from
this
strong
carmine
looked
all
the
more
dim
she
wore
a
vast
quantity
of
diamonds
and
dressed
with
sufficient
taste
not
to
make
herself
ridiculous
her
sharp
nose
promised
epigram
a
set
of
teeth
preserved
a
smile
of
such
irony
as
recalled
that
of
voltaire
at
the
same
time
the
exquisite
politeness
of
her
manners
so
effectually
softened
the
mischievous
twist
in
her
mind
that
it
was
impossible
to
accuse
her
of
spitefulness
the
old
woman
s
eyes
lighted
up
and
a
triumphant
glance
seconded
by
a
smile
which
said
i
promised
you
as
much
shot
across
the
room
and
brought
a
blush
of
hope
to
the
pale
cheeks
of
the
young
creature
languishing
under
the
great
chandelier
the
alliance
between
madame
de
lansac
and
the
stranger
could
not
escape
the
practised
eye
of
the
comtesse
de
vaudremont
who
scented
a
mystery
and
was
determined
to
penetrate
it
at
this
instant
the
baron
de
la
after
questioning
all
the
dowagers
without
success
as
to
the
blue
lady
s
name
applied
in
despair
to
the
comtesse
de
gondreville
from
whom
he
reached
only
this
unsatisfactory
reply
a
lady
whom
the
ancient
duchesse
de
lansac
introduced
to
turning
by
chance
towards
the
armchair
occupied
by
the
old
lady
the
lawyer
intercepted
the
glance
of
intelligence
she
sent
to
the
stranger
and
although
he
had
for
some
time
been
on
bad
terms
with
her
he
determined
to
speak
to
her
the
ancient
duchess
seeing
the
jaunty
baron
prowling
round
her
chair
smiled
with
sardonic
irony
and
looked
at
madame
de
vaudremont
with
an
expression
that
made
montcornet
laugh
if
the
old
witch
affects
to
be
friendly
thought
the
baron
she
is
certainly
going
to
play
me
some
spiteful
madame
he
said
you
have
i
am
told
undertaken
the
charge
of
a
very
precious
do
you
take
me
for
a
dragon
said
the
old
lady
but
of
whom
are
you
speaking
she
added
with
a
sweetness
which
revived
martial
s
hopes
of
that
little
lady
unknown
to
all
whom
the
jealousy
of
all
these
coquettes
has
imprisoned
in
that
corner
you
no
doubt
know
her
family
yes
said
the
duchess
but
what
concern
have
you
with
a
provincial
heiress
married
some
time
since
a
woman
of
good
birth
whom
you
none
of
you
know
you
men
she
goes
why
does
not
she
dance
she
is
such
a
pretty
creature
may
we
conclude
a
treaty
of
peace
if
you
will
vouchsafe
to
tell
me
all
i
want
to
know
i
promise
you
that
a
petition
for
the
restitution
of
the
woods
of
navarreins
by
the
commissioners
of
crown
lands
shall
be
strongly
urged
on
the
the
younger
branch
of
the
house
of
navarreins
bears
quarterly
with
the
arms
of
navarreins
those
of
lansac
namely
azure
and
argent
party
per
pale
raguly
between
six
in
pale
and
the
old
lady
s
liaison
with
louis
xv
had
earned
her
husband
the
title
of
duke
by
royal
patent
now
as
the
navarreins
had
not
yet
resettled
in
france
it
was
sheer
trickery
that
the
young
lawyer
thus
proposed
to
the
old
lady
by
suggesting
to
her
that
she
should
petition
for
an
estate
belonging
to
the
elder
branch
of
the
family
monsieur
said
the
old
woman
with
deceptive
gravity
bring
the
comtesse
de
vaudremont
across
to
me
i
promise
you
that
i
will
reveal
to
her
the
mystery
of
the
interesting
unknown
you
see
every
man
in
the
room
has
reached
as
great
a
curiosity
as
your
own
all
eyes
are
involuntarily
turned
towards
the
corner
where
my
protegee
has
so
modestly
placed
herself
she
is
reaping
all
the
homage
the
women
wished
to
deprive
her
of
happy
the
man
she
chooses
for
her
partner
she
interrupted
herself
fixing
her
eyes
on
madame
de
vaudremont
with
one
of
those
looks
which
plainly
say
we
are
talking
of
then
she
added
i
imagine
you
would
rather
learn
the
stranger
s
name
from
the
lips
of
your
handsome
countess
than
from
there
was
such
marked
defiance
in
the
duchess
attitude
that
madame
de
vaudremont
rose
came
up
to
her
and
took
the
chair
martial
placed
for
her
then
without
noticing
him
she
said
i
can
guess
madame
that
you
are
talking
of
me
but
i
admit
my
want
of
perspicacity
i
do
not
know
whether
it
is
for
good
or
madame
de
lansac
pressed
the
young
woman
s
pretty
hand
in
her
own
dry
and
wrinkled
fingers
and
answered
in
a
low
compassionate
tone
poor
child
the
women
looked
at
each
other
madame
de
vaudremont
understood
that
martial
was
in
the
way
and
dismissed
him
saying
with
an
imperious
expression
leave
the
baron
at
seeing
the
countess
under
the
spell
of
the
dangerous
sibyl
who
had
drawn
her
to
her
side
gave
one
of
those
looks
which
a
man
can
give
potent
over
a
blinded
heart
but
simply
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
is
beginning
to
criticise
the
man
who
has
attracted
her
do
you
think
you
can
play
the
emperor
said
madame
de
vaudremont
turning
of
her
face
to
fix
an
ironical
sidelong
gaze
on
the
lawyer
martial
was
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
and
had
too
much
wit
and
acumen
to
risk
breaking
with
a
woman
who
was
in
favor
at
court
and
whom
the
emperor
wished
to
see
married
he
counted
too
on
the
jealousy
he
intended
to
provoke
in
her
as
the
surest
means
of
discovering
the
secret
of
her
coolness
and
withdrew
all
the
more
willingly
because
at
this
moment
a
new
quadrille
was
putting
everybody
in
motion
with
an
air
of
making
room
for
the
dancing
the
baron
leaned
back
against
the
marble
slab
of
a
console
folded
his
arms
and
stood
absorbed
in
watching
the
two
ladies
talking
from
time
to
time
he
followed
the
glances
which
both
frequently
directed
to
the
stranger
then
comparing
the
countess
with
the
new
beauty
made
so
attractive
by
a
touch
of
mystery
the
baron
fell
a
prey
to
the
detestable
common
to
adventurous
he
hesitated
between
a
fortune
within
his
grasp
and
the
indulgence
of
his
caprice
the
blaze
of
light
gave
such
strong
relief
to
his
anxious
and
sullen
face
against
the
hangings
of
white
silk
moreen
brushed
by
his
black
hair
that
he
might
have
been
compared
to
an
evil
genius
even
from
a
distance
more
than
one
observer
no
doubt
said
to
himself
there
is
another
poor
wretch
who
seems
to
be
enjoying
himself
the
colonel
meanwhile
with
one
shoulder
leaning
lightly
against
the
of
the
doorway
between
the
ballroom
and
the
cardroom
could
laugh
undetected
under
his
ample
moustache
it
amused
him
to
look
on
at
the
turmoil
of
the
dance
he
could
see
a
hundred
pretty
heads
turning
about
in
obedience
to
the
figures
he
could
read
in
some
faces
as
in
those
of
the
countess
and
his
friend
martial
the
secrets
of
their
agitation
and
then
looking
round
he
wondered
what
connection
there
could
be
between
the
gloomy
looks
of
the
comte
de
soulanges
still
seated
on
the
sofa
and
the
plaintive
expression
of
the
fair
unknown
on
whose
features
the
joys
of
hope
and
the
anguish
of
involuntary
dread
were
alternately
legible
montcornet
stood
like
the
king
of
the
feast
in
this
moving
picture
he
saw
a
complete
presentment
of
the
world
and
he
laughed
at
it
as
he
found
himself
the
object
of
inviting
smiles
from
a
hundred
beautiful
and
elegant
women
a
colonel
of
the
imperial
guard
a
position
equal
to
that
of
a
was
undoubtedly
one
of
the
best
matches
in
the
army
it
was
now
nearly
midnight
the
conversation
the
gambling
the
dancing
the
flirtations
interests
petty
rivalries
and
scheming
had
all
reached
the
pitch
of
ardor
which
makes
a
young
man
exclaim
involuntarily
a
fine
ball
my
sweet
little
angel
said
madame
de
lansac
to
the
countess
you
are
now
at
an
age
when
in
my
day
i
made
many
mistakes
seeing
you
are
just
now
enduring
a
thousand
deaths
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
give
you
some
charitable
advice
to
go
wrong
at
means
spoiling
your
future
is
it
not
tearing
the
gown
you
must
wear
my
dear
it
is
not
much
later
that
we
learn
to
go
about
in
it
without
crumpling
it
go
on
sweetheart
making
clever
enemies
and
friends
who
have
no
sense
of
conduct
and
you
will
see
what
a
pleasant
life
you
will
some
day
be
leading
oh
madame
it
is
very
hard
for
a
woman
to
be
happy
do
not
you
think
the
countess
eagerly
exclaimed
my
child
at
your
age
you
must
learn
to
choose
between
pleasure
and
happiness
you
want
to
marry
martial
who
is
not
fool
enough
to
make
a
good
husband
nor
passionate
enough
to
remain
a
lover
he
is
in
debt
my
dear
he
is
the
man
to
run
through
your
fortune
still
that
would
be
nothing
if
he
could
make
you
do
not
you
see
how
aged
he
is
the
man
must
have
been
ill
he
is
making
the
most
of
what
is
left
him
in
three
years
he
will
be
a
wreck
then
he
will
be
ambitious
perhaps
he
may
succeed
i
do
not
think
what
is
he
a
man
of
intrigue
who
may
have
the
business
faculty
to
perfection
and
be
able
to
gossip
agreeably
but
he
is
too
presumptuous
to
have
any
sterling
merit
he
will
not
go
far
besides
only
look
at
him
is
it
not
written
on
his
brow
that
at
this
very
moment
what
he
sees
in
you
is
not
a
young
and
pretty
woman
but
the
two
million
francs
you
possess
he
does
not
love
you
my
dear
he
is
reckoning
you
up
as
if
you
were
an
investment
if
you
are
bent
on
marrying
find
an
older
man
who
has
an
assured
position
and
is
on
his
career
a
widow
s
marriage
ought
not
to
be
a
trivial
love
affair
is
a
mouse
to
be
caught
a
second
time
in
the
same
trap
a
new
alliance
ought
now
to
be
a
good
speculation
on
your
part
and
in
marrying
again
you
ought
at
least
to
have
a
hope
of
being
some
day
addressed
as
madame
la
marechale
as
she
spoke
both
women
naturally
fixed
their
eyes
on
colonel
montcornet
s
handsome
face
if
you
would
rather
play
the
delicate
part
of
a
flirt
and
not
marry
again
the
duchess
went
on
with
blunt
well
my
poor
child
you
better
than
any
woman
will
know
how
to
raise
the
and
disperse
them
again
but
i
beseech
you
never
make
it
your
pleasure
to
disturb
the
peace
of
families
to
destroy
unions
and
ruin
the
happiness
of
happy
wives
i
my
dear
have
played
that
perilous
game
dear
heaven
for
a
triumph
of
vanity
some
poor
virtuous
soul
is
murdered
for
there
really
are
virtuous
women
child
and
we
may
make
ourselves
mortally
hated
i
learned
a
little
too
late
that
as
the
duc
d
albe
once
said
one
salmon
is
worth
a
thousand
frogs
a
genuine
affection
certainly
brings
a
thousand
times
more
happiness
than
the
transient
passions
we
may
well
i
came
here
on
purpose
to
preach
to
you
yes
you
are
the
cause
of
my
appearance
in
this
house
which
stinks
of
the
lower
class
have
i
not
just
seen
actors
here
formerly
my
dear
we
received
them
in
our
boudoir
but
in
the
never
why
do
you
look
at
me
with
so
much
amazement
listen
to
me
if
you
want
to
play
with
men
do
not
try
to
wring
the
hearts
of
any
but
those
whose
life
is
not
yet
settled
who
have
no
duties
to
fulfil
the
others
do
not
forgive
us
for
the
errors
that
have
made
them
happy
profit
by
this
maxim
founded
on
my
long
that
luckless
soulanges
for
instance
whose
head
you
have
turned
whom
you
have
intoxicated
for
these
fifteen
months
past
god
knows
how
do
you
know
at
what
you
have
struck
at
his
whole
life
he
has
been
married
these
two
years
he
is
worshiped
by
a
charming
wife
whom
he
loves
but
neglects
she
lives
in
tears
and
embittered
silence
soulanges
has
had
hours
of
remorse
more
terrible
than
his
pleasure
has
been
sweet
and
you
you
artful
little
thing
have
deserted
well
come
and
see
your
the
old
lady
took
madame
de
vaudremont
s
hand
and
they
rose
there
said
madame
de
lansac
and
her
eyes
showed
her
the
stranger
sitting
pale
and
tremulous
under
the
glare
of
the
candles
that
is
my
grandniece
the
comtesse
de
soulanges
she
yielded
at
last
to
my
persuasion
and
consented
to
leave
the
sorrowful
room
where
the
sight
of
her
child
gives
her
but
little
consolation
you
see
her
you
think
her
charming
then
imagine
dear
beauty
what
she
must
have
been
when
happiness
and
love
shed
their
glory
on
that
face
now
the
countess
looked
away
in
silence
and
seemed
lost
in
sad
reflections
the
duchess
led
her
to
the
door
into
the
then
after
looking
round
the
room
as
if
in
search
of
some
one
and
there
is
soulanges
she
said
in
deep
tones
the
countess
shuddered
as
she
saw
in
the
least
brilliantly
lighted
corner
the
pale
set
face
of
soulanges
stretched
in
an
the
indifference
of
his
attitude
and
the
rigidity
of
his
brow
betrayed
his
suffering
the
players
passed
him
to
and
fro
without
paying
any
more
attention
to
him
than
if
he
had
been
dead
the
picture
of
the
wife
in
tears
and
the
dejected
morose
husband
separated
in
the
midst
of
this
festivity
like
the
two
halves
of
a
tree
blasted
by
lightning
had
perhaps
a
prophetic
significance
for
the
countess
she
dreaded
lest
she
here
saw
an
image
of
the
revenges
the
future
might
have
in
store
for
her
her
heart
was
not
yet
so
dried
up
that
the
feeling
and
generosity
were
entirely
excluded
and
she
pressed
the
duchess
hand
while
thanking
her
by
one
of
those
smiles
which
have
a
certain
childlike
grace
my
dear
child
the
old
lady
said
in
her
ear
remember
henceforth
that
we
are
just
as
capable
of
repelling
a
man
s
attentions
as
of
attracting
she
is
yours
if
you
are
not
a
these
words
were
whispered
into
colonel
montcornet
s
ear
by
madame
de
lansac
while
the
handsome
countess
was
still
absorbed
in
compassion
at
the
sight
of
soulanges
for
she
still
loved
him
truly
enough
to
wish
to
restore
him
to
happiness
and
was
promising
herself
in
her
own
mind
that
she
would
exert
the
irresistible
power
her
charms
still
had
over
him
to
make
him
return
to
his
wife
oh
i
will
talk
to
him
said
she
to
madame
de
lansac
do
nothing
of
the
kind
my
dear
cried
the
old
lady
as
she
went
back
to
her
armchair
choose
a
good
husband
and
shut
your
door
to
my
nephew
believe
me
my
child
a
wife
can
not
accept
her
husband
s
heart
as
the
gift
of
another
woman
she
is
a
hundred
times
happier
in
the
belief
that
she
has
reconquered
it
by
bringing
my
niece
here
i
believe
i
have
given
her
an
excellent
chance
of
regaining
her
husband
s
affection
all
the
assistance
i
need
of
you
is
to
play
the
she
pointed
to
the
baron
s
friend
and
the
countess
smiled
well
madame
do
you
at
last
know
the
name
of
the
unknown
asked
martial
with
an
air
of
pique
to
the
countess
when
he
saw
her
alone
yes
said
madame
de
vaudremont
looking
him
in
the
face
her
features
expressed
as
much
roguery
as
fun
the
smile
which
gave
life
to
her
lips
and
cheeks
the
liquid
brightness
of
her
eyes
were
like
the
which
leads
travelers
astray
martial
who
believed
that
she
still
loved
him
assumed
the
coquetting
graces
in
which
a
man
is
so
ready
to
lull
himself
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
he
loves
he
said
with
a
fatuous
air
and
will
you
be
annoyed
with
me
if
i
seem
to
attach
great
importance
to
your
telling
me
that
name
will
you
be
annoyed
with
me
answered
madame
de
vaudremont
if
a
remnant
of
affection
prevents
my
telling
you
and
if
i
forbid
you
to
make
the
smallest
advances
to
that
young
lady
it
would
be
at
the
risk
of
your
life
to
lose
your
good
graces
madame
would
be
worse
than
to
lose
my
martial
said
the
countess
severely
she
is
madame
de
soulanges
her
husband
would
blow
your
brains
out
if
indeed
you
have
any
ha
ha
laughed
the
coxcomb
what
the
colonel
can
leave
the
man
in
peace
who
has
robbed
him
of
your
love
and
then
would
fight
for
his
wife
what
a
subversion
of
principles
i
beg
of
you
to
allow
me
to
dance
with
the
little
lady
you
will
then
be
able
to
judge
how
little
love
that
heart
of
ice
could
feel
for
you
for
if
the
colonel
disapproves
of
my
dancing
with
his
wife
after
allowing
me
to
but
she
loves
her
a
still
further
obstacle
that
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
but
she
is
a
whimsical
objection
ah
said
the
countess
with
a
bitter
smile
you
punish
us
alike
for
our
faults
and
our
repentance
do
not
be
angry
exclaimed
martial
eagerly
oh
forgive
me
i
beseech
you
there
i
will
think
no
more
of
madame
de
you
deserve
that
i
should
send
you
to
i
am
off
then
said
the
baron
laughing
and
i
shall
return
more
devoted
to
you
than
ever
you
will
see
that
the
prettiest
woman
in
the
world
can
not
capture
the
heart
that
is
that
is
to
say
that
you
want
to
win
colonel
montcornet
s
horse
ah
traitor
said
he
threatening
his
friend
with
his
finger
the
colonel
smiled
and
joined
them
the
baron
gave
him
the
seat
near
the
countess
saying
to
her
with
a
sardonic
accent
here
madame
is
a
man
who
boasted
that
he
could
win
your
good
graces
in
one
he
went
away
thinking
himself
clever
to
have
piqued
the
countess
pride
and
done
montcornet
an
ill
turn
but
in
spite
of
his
habitual
keenness
he
had
not
appreciated
the
irony
underlying
madame
de
vaudremont
s
speech
and
did
not
perceive
that
she
had
come
as
far
to
meet
his
friend
as
his
friend
towards
her
though
both
were
unconscious
of
it
at
that
moment
when
the
lawyer
went
fluttering
up
to
the
candelabrum
by
which
madame
de
soulanges
sat
pale
timid
and
apparently
alive
only
in
her
eyes
her
husband
came
to
the
door
of
the
ballroom
his
eyes
flashing
with
anger
the
old
duchess
watchful
of
everything
flew
to
her
nephew
begged
him
to
give
her
his
arm
and
find
her
carriage
affecting
to
be
mortally
bored
and
hoping
thus
to
prevent
a
vexatious
outbreak
before
going
she
fired
a
singular
glance
of
intelligence
at
her
niece
indicating
the
enterprising
knight
who
was
about
to
address
her
and
this
signal
seemed
to
say
there
he
is
avenge
yourself
madame
de
vaudremont
caught
these
looks
of
the
aunt
and
niece
a
sudden
light
dawned
on
her
mind
she
was
frightened
lest
she
was
the
dupe
of
this
old
woman
so
cunning
and
so
practised
in
intrigue
that
perfidious
duchess
said
she
to
herself
has
perhaps
been
amusing
herself
by
preaching
morality
to
me
while
playing
me
some
spiteful
trick
of
her
at
this
thought
madame
de
vaudremont
s
pride
was
perhaps
more
roused
than
her
curiosity
to
disentangle
the
thread
of
this
intrigue
in
the
absorption
of
mind
to
which
she
was
a
prey
she
was
no
longer
mistress
of
herself
the
colonel
interpreting
to
his
own
advantage
the
embarrassment
evident
in
the
countess
manner
and
speech
became
more
ardent
and
pressing
the
old
blase
diplomates
amusing
themselves
by
watching
the
play
of
faces
had
never
found
so
many
intrigues
at
once
to
watch
or
guess
at
the
passions
agitating
the
two
couples
were
to
be
seen
with
variations
at
every
step
in
the
crowded
rooms
and
reflected
with
different
shades
in
other
countenances
the
spectacle
of
so
many
vivid
passions
of
all
these
lovers
quarrels
these
pleasing
revenges
these
cruel
favors
these
flaming
glances
of
all
this
ardent
life
diffused
around
them
only
made
them
feel
their
impotence
more
keenly
at
last
the
baron
had
found
a
seat
by
madame
de
soulanges
his
eyes
stole
a
long
look
at
her
neck
as
fresh
as
dew
and
as
fragrant
as
field
flowers
he
admired
close
at
hand
the
beauty
which
had
amazed
him
from
afar
he
could
see
a
small
foot
and
measure
with
his
eye
a
slender
and
graceful
shape
at
that
time
women
wore
their
sash
tied
close
under
the
bosom
in
imitation
of
greek
statues
a
pitiless
fashion
for
those
whose
bust
was
faulty
as
he
cast
furtive
glances
at
the
countess
figure
martial
was
enchanted
with
its
perfection
you
have
not
danced
once
this
evening
madame
said
he
in
soft
and
flattering
tones
not
i
should
suppose
for
lack
of
a
partner
i
never
go
to
parties
i
am
quite
unknown
replied
madame
de
soulanges
coldly
not
having
understood
the
look
by
which
her
aunt
had
just
conveyed
to
her
that
she
was
to
attract
the
baron
martial
to
give
himself
countenance
twisted
the
diamond
he
wore
on
his
left
hand
the
rainbow
fires
of
the
gem
seemed
to
flash
a
sudden
light
on
the
young
countess
mind
she
blushed
and
looked
at
the
baron
with
an
undefinable
expression
do
you
like
dancing
asked
the
provencal
to
reopen
the
conversation
yes
very
much
at
this
strange
reply
their
eyes
met
the
young
man
surprised
by
the
earnest
accent
which
aroused
a
vague
hope
in
his
heart
had
suddenly
questioned
the
lady
s
eyes
then
madame
am
i
not
overbold
in
offering
myself
to
be
your
partner
for
the
next
quadrille
artless
confusion
colored
the
countess
white
cheeks
but
monsieur
i
have
already
refused
one
partner
a
military
man
was
it
that
tall
cavalry
colonel
whom
you
see
over
there
precisely
oh
he
is
a
friend
of
mine
feel
no
alarm
will
you
grant
me
the
favor
i
dare
hope
for
yes
her
tone
betrayed
an
emotion
so
new
and
so
deep
that
the
lawyer
s
soul
was
touched
he
was
overcome
by
shyness
like
a
schoolboy
s
lost
his
confidence
and
his
southern
brain
caught
fire
he
tried
to
talk
but
his
phrases
struck
him
as
graceless
in
comparison
with
madame
de
soulanges
bright
and
subtle
replies
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
the
quadrille
was
forming
standing
by
his
beautiful
partner
he
felt
more
at
ease
to
many
men
dancing
is
a
phase
of
being
they
think
that
they
can
more
powerfully
influence
the
heart
of
woman
by
displaying
the
graces
of
their
bodies
than
by
their
intellect
martial
wished
no
doubt
at
this
moment
to
put
forth
all
his
most
effective
seductions
to
judge
by
the
pretentiousness
of
his
movements
and
gestures
he
led
his
conquest
to
the
quadrille
in
which
the
most
brilliant
women
in
the
room
made
it
a
point
of
chimerical
importance
to
dance
in
preference
to
any
other
while
the
orchestra
played
the
introductory
bars
to
the
first
figure
the
baron
felt
it
an
incredible
gratification
to
his
pride
to
perceive
as
he
reviewed
the
ladies
forming
the
lines
of
that
formidable
square
that
madame
de
soulanges
dress
might
challenge
that
even
of
madame
de
vaudremont
who
by
a
chance
not
perhaps
unsought
was
standing
with
montcornet
to
himself
and
the
lady
in
blue
all
eyes
were
for
a
moment
turned
on
madame
de
soulanges
a
flattering
murmur
showed
that
she
was
the
subject
of
every
man
s
conversation
with
his
partner
looks
of
admiration
and
envy
centered
on
her
with
so
much
eagerness
that
the
young
creature
abashed
by
a
triumph
she
seemed
to
disclaim
modestly
looked
down
blushed
and
was
all
the
more
charming
when
she
raised
her
white
eyelids
it
was
to
look
at
her
ravished
partner
as
though
she
wished
to
transfer
the
glory
of
this
admiration
to
him
and
to
say
that
she
cared
more
for
his
than
for
all
the
rest
she
threw
her
innocence
into
her
vanity
or
rather
she
seemed
to
give
herself
up
to
the
guileless
admiration
which
is
the
beginning
of
love
with
the
good
faith
found
only
in
youthful
hearts
as
she
danced
the
might
easily
believe
that
she
displayed
her
grace
for
martial
alone
and
though
she
was
modest
and
new
to
the
trickery
of
the
ballroom
she
knew
as
well
as
the
most
accomplished
coquette
how
to
raise
her
eyes
to
his
at
the
right
moment
and
drop
their
lids
with
assumed
modesty
when
the
movement
of
a
new
figure
invented
by
a
dancer
named
trenis
and
named
after
him
brought
martial
face
to
face
with
the
colonel
i
have
won
your
horse
said
he
laughing
yes
but
you
have
lost
eighty
thousand
francs
a
year
retorted
montcornet
glancing
at
madame
de
vaudremont
what
do
i
care
replied
martial
madame
de
soulanges
is
worth
millions
at
the
end
of
the
quadrille
more
than
one
whisper
was
poured
into
more
than
one
ear
the
less
pretty
women
made
moral
speeches
to
their
partners
commenting
on
the
budding
liaison
between
martial
and
the
comtesse
de
soulanges
the
handsomest
wondered
at
her
easy
surrender
the
men
could
not
understand
such
luck
as
the
baron
s
not
regarding
him
as
particularly
fascinating
a
few
indulgent
women
said
it
was
not
fair
to
judge
the
countess
too
hastily
young
wives
would
be
in
a
very
hapless
plight
if
an
expressive
look
or
a
few
graceful
dancing
steps
were
enough
to
compromise
a
woman
martial
alone
knew
the
extent
of
his
happiness
during
the
last
figure
when
the
ladies
had
to
form
the
his
fingers
clasped
those
of
the
countess
and
he
fancied
that
through
the
thin
perfumed
kid
of
her
gloves
the
young
wife
s
grasp
responded
to
his
amorous
appeal
madame
said
he
as
the
quadrille
ended
do
not
go
back
to
the
odious
corner
where
you
have
been
burying
your
face
and
your
dress
until
now
is
admiration
the
only
benefit
you
can
obtain
from
the
jewels
that
adorn
your
white
neck
and
beautifully
dressed
hair
come
and
take
a
turn
through
the
rooms
to
enjoy
the
scene
and
madame
de
soulanges
yielded
to
her
seducer
who
thought
she
would
be
his
all
the
more
surely
if
he
could
only
show
her
off
side
by
side
they
walked
two
or
three
times
amid
the
groups
who
crowded
the
rooms
the
comtesse
de
soulanges
evidently
uneasy
paused
for
an
instant
at
each
door
before
entering
only
doing
so
after
stretching
her
neck
to
look
at
all
the
men
there
this
alarm
which
crowned
the
baron
s
satisfaction
did
not
seem
to
be
removed
till
he
said
to
her
make
yourself
easy
is
not
they
thus
made
their
way
to
an
immense
picture
gallery
in
a
wing
of
the
mansion
where
their
eyes
could
feast
in
anticipation
on
the
splendid
display
of
a
collation
prepared
for
three
hundred
persons
as
supper
was
about
to
begin
martial
led
the
countess
to
an
oval
boudoir
looking
on
to
the
garden
where
the
rarest
flowers
and
a
few
shrubs
made
a
scented
bower
under
bright
blue
hangings
the
murmurs
of
the
festivity
here
died
away
the
countess
at
first
startled
refused
firmly
to
follow
the
young
man
but
glancing
in
a
mirror
she
no
doubt
assured
herself
that
they
could
be
seen
for
she
seated
herself
on
an
ottoman
with
a
fairly
good
grace
this
room
is
charming
said
she
admiring
the
hangings
looped
with
pearls
all
here
is
love
and
delight
said
the
baron
with
deep
emotion
in
the
mysterious
light
which
prevailed
he
looked
at
the
countess
and
detected
on
her
gently
agitated
face
an
expression
of
uneasiness
modesty
and
eagerness
which
enchanted
him
the
young
lady
smiled
and
this
smile
seemed
to
put
an
end
to
the
struggle
of
feeling
surging
in
her
heart
in
the
most
insinuating
way
she
took
her
adorer
s
left
hand
and
drew
from
his
finger
the
ring
on
which
she
had
fixed
her
eyes
what
a
fine
diamond
she
exclaimed
in
the
artless
tone
of
a
young
girl
betraying
the
incitement
of
a
first
temptation
martial
troubled
by
the
countess
involuntary
but
intoxicating
touch
like
a
caress
as
she
drew
off
the
ring
looked
at
her
with
eyes
as
glittering
as
the
gem
wear
it
he
said
in
memory
of
this
hour
and
for
the
love
of
she
was
looking
at
him
with
such
rapture
that
he
did
not
end
the
sentence
he
kissed
her
hand
you
give
it
me
she
said
looking
much
astonished
i
wish
i
had
the
whole
world
to
offer
you
you
are
not
joking
she
went
on
in
a
voice
husky
with
too
great
satisfaction
will
you
accept
only
my
diamond
you
will
never
take
it
back
she
insisted
she
put
the
ring
on
her
finger
martial
confident
of
coming
happiness
was
about
to
put
his
hand
round
her
waist
but
she
suddenly
rose
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
without
any
agitation
i
accept
the
diamond
monsieur
with
the
less
scruple
because
it
belongs
to
the
baron
was
speechless
monsieur
de
soulanges
took
it
lately
from
my
and
told
me
he
had
lost
you
are
mistaken
madame
said
martial
nettled
it
was
given
me
by
madame
de
precisely
so
she
said
with
a
smile
my
husband
borrowed
this
ring
of
me
he
gave
it
to
her
she
made
it
a
present
to
you
my
ring
has
made
a
little
journey
that
is
all
this
ring
will
perhaps
tell
me
all
i
do
not
know
and
teach
me
the
secret
of
always
monsieur
she
went
on
if
it
had
not
been
my
own
you
may
be
sure
i
should
not
have
risked
paying
so
dear
for
it
for
a
young
woman
it
is
said
is
in
danger
with
you
but
you
see
and
she
touched
a
spring
within
the
ring
here
is
de
soulanges
she
fled
into
the
crowded
rooms
so
swiftly
that
it
seemed
useless
to
try
to
follow
her
besides
martial
utterly
confounded
was
in
no
mood
to
carry
the
adventure
further
the
countess
laugh
found
an
echo
in
the
boudoir
where
the
young
coxcomb
now
perceived
between
two
shrubs
the
colonel
and
madame
de
vaudremont
both
laughing
heartily
will
you
have
my
horse
to
ride
after
your
prize
said
the
colonel
the
baron
took
the
banter
poured
upon
him
by
madame
de
vaudremont
and
montcornet
with
a
good
grace
which
secured
their
silence
as
to
the
events
of
the
evening
when
his
friend
exchanged
his
charger
for
a
rich
and
pretty
young
wife
as
the
comtesse
de
soulanges
drove
across
paris
from
the
chausee
d
antin
to
the
faubourg
where
she
lived
her
soul
was
prey
to
many
alarms
before
leaving
the
hotel
gondreville
she
went
through
all
the
rooms
but
found
neither
her
aunt
nor
her
husband
who
had
gone
away
without
her
frightful
suspicions
then
tortured
her
ingenuous
mind
a
silent
witness
of
her
husbands
torments
since
the
day
when
madame
de
vaudremont
had
chained
him
to
her
car
she
had
confidently
hoped
that
repentance
would
ere
long
restore
her
husband
to
her
it
was
with
unspeakable
repugnance
that
she
had
consented
to
the
scheme
plotted
by
her
aunt
madame
de
lansac
and
at
this
moment
she
feared
she
had
made
a
mistake
the
evening
s
experience
had
saddened
her
innocent
soul
alarmed
at
first
by
the
count
s
look
of
suffering
and
dejection
she
had
become
more
so
on
seeing
her
rival
s
beauty
and
the
corruption
of
society
had
gripped
her
heart
as
she
crossed
the
pont
royal
she
threw
away
the
desecrated
hair
at
the
back
of
the
diamond
given
to
her
once
as
a
token
of
the
purest
affection
she
wept
as
she
remembered
the
bitter
grief
to
which
she
had
so
long
been
a
victim
and
shuddered
more
than
once
as
she
reflected
that
the
duty
of
a
woman
who
wishes
for
peace
in
her
home
compels
her
to
bury
sufferings
so
keen
as
hers
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
and
without
a
complaint
alas
thought
she
what
can
women
do
when
they
do
not
love
what
is
the
fount
of
their
indulgence
i
can
not
believe
that
as
my
aunt
tells
me
reason
is
to
maintain
them
in
such
she
was
still
sighing
when
her
let
down
the
handsome
down
which
she
flew
into
the
hall
of
her
house
she
rushed
precipitately
upstairs
and
when
she
reached
her
room
was
startled
by
seeing
her
husband
sitting
by
the
fire
how
long
is
it
my
dear
since
you
have
gone
to
balls
without
telling
me
beforehand
he
asked
in
a
broken
voice
you
must
know
that
a
woman
is
always
out
of
place
without
her
husband
you
compromised
yourself
strangely
by
remaining
in
the
dark
corner
where
you
had
ensconced
oh
my
dear
good
leon
said
she
in
a
coaxing
tone
i
could
not
resist
the
happiness
of
seeing
you
without
your
seeing
me
my
aunt
took
me
to
this
ball
and
i
was
very
happy
there
this
speech
disarmed
the
count
s
looks
of
their
assumed
severity
for
he
had
been
blaming
himself
while
dreading
his
wife
s
return
no
doubt
fully
informed
at
the
ball
of
an
infidelity
he
had
hoped
to
hide
from
her
and
as
is
the
way
of
lovers
conscious
of
their
guilt
he
tried
by
being
the
first
to
find
fault
to
escape
her
just
anger
happy
in
seeing
her
husband
smile
and
in
finding
him
at
this
hour
in
a
room
whither
of
late
he
had
come
more
rarely
the
countess
looked
at
him
so
tenderly
that
she
blushed
and
cast
down
her
eyes
her
clemency
enraptured
soulanges
all
the
more
because
this
scene
followed
on
the
misery
he
had
endured
at
the
ball
he
seized
his
wife
s
hand
and
kissed
it
gratefully
is
not
gratitude
often
a
part
of
love
hortense
what
is
that
on
your
finger
that
has
hurt
my
lip
so
much
asked
he
laughing
it
is
my
diamond
which
you
said
you
had
lost

which
