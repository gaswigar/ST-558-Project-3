introduction
a
neglected
masterpiece
there
have
of
course
been
many
men
of
genius
who
have
united
with
great
laxity
and
waywardness
in
their
lives
a
high
and
perfect
respect
for
their
art
but
instances
of
the
directly
contrary
practice
are
much
rarer
and
among
these
there
is
probably
none
more
prominent
than
that
of
the
author
of
gifted
by
nature
with
a
faculty
which
was
at
once
brilliant
powerful
and
genial
he
led
an
industrious
life
the
upright
and
generally
exemplary
character
of
which
has
never
for
a
moment
been
called
in
question
but
in
the
sphere
of
his
art
it
is
as
undeniable
as
unaccountable
that
he
cared
little
or
nothing
to
do
his
best
the
haps
or
whims
of
the
moment
seem
indeed
to
have
governed
his
production
with
an
influence
as
of
stars
malign
or
fortunate
furthermore
we
know
that
the
profession
of
authorship
that
most
distinguished
of
all
professions
as
speaking
in
sober
sadness
without
arrogance
we
can
not
but
be
bold
to
call
it
that
profession
from
which
he
was
himself
so
well
equipt
to
derive
honour
was
held
by
him
in
low
esteem
so
that
speaking
of
the
time
of
his
residence
in
upper
canada
he
thinks
no
shame
to
observe
that
he
did
consider
himself
qualified
to
do
something
more
useful
than
stringing
blethers
into
rhyme
or
writing
in
a
closet
and
again
says
he
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
sometimes
felt
a
little
shamefaced
in
thinking
myself
so
much
an
author
in
consequence
of
the
estimation
in
which
i
view
the
profession
of
in
general
a
mere
literary
man
an
author
by
profession
stands
low
in
my
opinion
such
remarks
as
these
from
a
man
of
commanding
literary
talent
are
the
reverse
of
pleasant
reading
but
let
us
deal
with
the
speaker
as
we
would
ourselves
be
dealt
by
mercifully
and
regard
these
petulant
utterances
as
a
mere
expression
of
bitterness
or
perversity
in
one
much
tried
and
sorely
disappointed
even
so
the
fact
remains
that
the
sum
of
immense
and
varied
production
exhibits
inequalities
of
execution
for
which
only
carelessness
or
contempt
in
the
worker
for
his
task
can
adequately
account
we
shall
presently
have
occasion
to
speak
of
him
in
his
relation
to
the
great
contemporary
writer
to
whose
life
and
work
his
own
work
and
life
present
so
many
interesting
points
of
similarity
and
diversity
but
we
may
here
note
that
in
the
glaringly
disparate
character
of
his
output
the
author
of
is
in
absolute
contrast
to
the
author
of
for
if
scott
work
viewed
as
a
whole
be
rarely
of
the
very
finest
literary
quality
its
evenness
within
its
own
limits
is
on
the
other
hand
very
striking
indeed
for
of
his
novels
there
are
perhaps
but
three
which
fall
perceptibly
below
the
general
level
of
excellence
whilst
probably
any
one
of
at
least
as
many
as
six
or
eight
might
by
a
quorum
of
competent
judges
be
selected
as
the
best
of
all
and
hence
where
in
the
case
of
other
authors
we
are
called
on
to
read
this
masterpiece
or
those
specimens
and
having
done
so
are
held
to
have
acquitted
ourselves
in
the
case
of
scott
we
can
not
feel
that
we
have
done
our
duty
till
we
have
read
through
the
waverley
novels
how
entirely
different
is
it
with
galt
where
we
find
occupying
one
shelf
with
annals
of
the
catalogued
with
and
side
by
side
with
and
obviously
it
is
in
this
inequality
in
its
author
work
in
the
magnitude
that
is
of
the
in
which
he
chose
to
secrete
his
jewels
that
the
explanation
of
the
neglect
if
not
rather
oblivion
into
which
the
work
has
fallen
can
alone
be
sought
and
found
for
once
in
the
threescore
years
of
his
busy
life
galt
did
his
best
consistently
and
on
a
large
scale
with
the
pen
and
that
once
was
in
the
novel
of
gilhaize
or
the
what
is
more
however
lamentably
he
may
appear
in
general
to
lack
the
faculty
of
he
knew
when
he
had
done
his
best
and
among
all
his
books
this
one
remained
his
favourite
but
a
man
has
to
pay
for
artistic
as
he
has
for
moral
delinquencies
and
it
would
seem
that
the
penalty
of
many
a
careless
tome
has
been
exacted
in
the
obscuration
of
one
of
the
finest
and
truest
of
historical
romances
in
our
language
a
word
or
two
as
to
the
genesis
and
character
of
the
book
which
we
have
ventured
thus
to
describe
may
not
be
out
of
place
as
preface
to
our
endeavour
to
obtain
for
it
a
second
hearing
it
was
in
the
year
or
that
galt
aged
then
about
and
having
already
seen
much
of
life
in
various
countries
and
capacities
settled
at
esk
grove
musselburgh
to
apply
himself
to
writing
historical
fiction
he
was
for
the
moment
elated
carried
away
perhaps
for
his
temper
was
enthusiastic
even
to
a
fault
by
the
recent
and
deserved
success
of
his
novels
of
scottish
manners
andrew
and
and
the
soaring
idea
appears
to
have
entered
his
head
of
deliberately
attempting
to
rival
scott
in
the
very
field
which
the
wizard
had
made
peculiarly
his
own
from
the
point
of
view
of
prudence
though
not
from
that
of
art
or
of
sport
this
enterprise
was
a
mistake
for
an
author
serving
as
he
does
the
public
shows
no
more
than
common
sense
if
he
endeavour
to
study
in
the
proper
degree
the
idiosyncrasies
of
that
employer
on
whose
favour
his
reputation
nay
perhaps
the
payment
of
his
butcher
bill
depends
and
it
has
long
been
observed
that
when
the
public
has
once
made
up
its
mind
that
one
man
is
supreme
in
his
own
line
it
has
generally
little
attention
to
spare
for
those
who
seek
to
have
it
reconsider
its
decision
this
by
the
way
was
amply
illustrated
in
the
sequel
of
the
very
case
now
under
discussion
but
the
names
of
galt
and
prudence
do
not
naturally
go
together
indeed
the
two
were
never
well
or
for
any
length
of
time
acquainted
at
esk
grove
either
in
earnest
or
as
seems
more
likely
in
banter
of
the
architectural
incongruities
of
abbotsford
galt
announced
his
intention
of
building
a
veritable
fortress
exactly
in
the
fashion
of
the
oldest
times
of
rude
warfare
he
worked
hard
with
his
pen
the
first
fruits
of
his
industry
appearing
in
the
novel
which
is
here
reprinted
after
some
years
what
of
the
merits
of
this
first
attempt
in
a
line
that
was
new
to
him
in
the
first
place
he
had
at
least
been
guided
in
his
choice
of
subject
by
an
unerring
historical
instinct
for
surpassingly
rich
as
is
scottish
history
in
the
elements
both
of
picturesque
and
romantic
incident
and
of
wild
and
fascinating
character
it
is
none
the
less
a
fact
that
there
is
but
one
period
during
which
that
history
rises
to
the
dignity
of
a
really
wide
and
permanent
interest
and
that
period
is
of
course
the
century
or
century
and
a
half
of
the
national
struggle
for
religious
liberty
it
is
not
necessary
to
remind
the
reader
that
upon
that
struggle
and
on
those
who
maintained
it
much
has
been
written
as
well
in
the
terms
of
undiscriminating
eulogy
as
in
those
of
uncomprehending
condemnation
nor
is
it
more
to
the
purpose
to
add
that
the
truth
lies
neither
entirely
on
one
side
nor
the
other
for
as
in
the
earlier
struggle
for
political
independence
and
indeed
more
or
less
in
all
other
great
national
movements
the
motives
of
most
of
those
who
took
part
were
mixed
and
varied
with
the
individual
thus
it
is
undeniable
that
in
the
breast
of
many
a
reforming
scottish
laird
of
the
sixteenth
century
mistrust
of
rome
was
a
subordinate
feeling
to
the
covetousness
excited
by
the
sight
of
extensive
and
church
lands
whilst
again
there
are
on
the
other
hand
probably
few
persons
now
in
existence
who
would
be
prepared
to
justify
the
intolerance
embodied
even
by
the
martyr
guthrie
in
his
celebrated
remonstrance
to
say
nothing
of
that
which
made
the
mere
hearing
of
the
mass
under
certain
circumstances
a
capital
offence
these
things
are
however
more
or
less
accidental
and
supply
no
criterion
by
which
the
true
character
of
the
reforming
movement
may
be
tested
for
during
the
sixteenth
and
seventeenth
centuries
the
very
nature
of
tolerance
if
understood
by
one
here
and
there
was
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
masses
of
the
people
and
yet
we
believe
that
notwithstanding
the
intolerant
and
implacable
spirit
too
often
manifested
by
the
covenanters
no
candid
reader
will
read
this
book
to
the
end
without
acknowledging
what
is
indeed
the
truth
that
the
soul
of
the
covenanting
movement
was
a
great
and
noble
one
and
that
soul
we
here
find
personified
in
the
younger
gilhaize
a
type
if
there
be
one
in
literature
of
the
covenanter
of
the
best
kind
for
whatever
may
have
been
the
temper
of
his
associates
in
the
aggregate
the
hero
of
the
book
holds
the
scales
between
the
rival
parties
with
admirable
evenness
and
this
notwithstanding
the
strong
bias
of
his
temper
and
upbringing
indeed
until
the
time
when
he
has
become
not
metaphorically
but
literally
maddened
by
the
wrongs
and
outrages
to
which
he
has
been
subjected
the
book
in
so
far
as
it
constitutes
an
expression
of
his
personal
sentiments
is
a
perfect
homily
on
fairness
and
how
much
such
fairness
has
to
do
with
the
winning
and
retaining
of
sympathy
perhaps
only
a
modern
reader
is
qualified
to
say
gifted
with
the
saving
graces
of
humour
and
of
the
supposed
annalist
of
our
chronicle
is
no
less
prepared
to
make
allowance
for
the
faults
of
the
other
side
than
to
acknowledge
the
shortcomings
of
his
own
in
fact
he
is
the
pattern
of
a
spirit
at
once
upright
humble
and
whose
ruling
passion
is
an
earnest
piety
and
who
asks
no
more
of
those
set
over
him
than
freedom
to
worship
god
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
conscience
and
for
this
little
boon
so
harshly
and
unjustly
withheld
we
see
him
called
upon
to
sacrifice
home
kindred
and
estate
to
know
his
wife
and
daughters
given
over
to
death
and
worse
than
death
and
finally
to
surrender
his
liberty
and
his
last
remaining
child
unless
pity
and
terror
in
a
master
hand
have
lost
their
power
surely
this
spectacle
is
a
moving
one
nor
must
we
forget
that
even
in
the
culminating
scene
of
the
tragedy
where
ringan
makes
his
bold
and
inspired
oration
at
the
meeting
of
the
cameronian
leaders
with
renwick
in
a
dell
near
lasswade
the
hero
for
all
his
wrongs
remains
unembittered
and
retains
unimpaired
the
gentleness
and
the
manliness
which
are
his
characteristics
that
there
were
such
men
as
this
among
the
covenanters
or
that
they
constituted
the
salt
which
gave
its
savour
to
the
movement
we
are
forbidden
to
doubt
but
saving
in
the
pages
which
follow
we
know
not
where
to
seek
for
the
ideal
presentment
of
one
such
this
is
what
we
mean
by
saying
as
we
have
said
above
that
galt
has
in
this
romance
laid
bare
the
soul
of
the
covenanting
movement
and
this
we
may
add
is
what
scott
in
most
signally
failed
to
do
for
in
that
novel
in
place
of
galt
subtle
and
penetrating
analysis
of
the
motives
which
animated
the
covenanters
nobly
to
dare
and
nobly
to
endure
we
find
the
author
content
himself
with
using
the
characteristics
and
the
disturbances
of
the
time
for
the
mere
purpose
of
providing
incident
and
adventure
and
a
strong
local
colour
for
his
puppets
in
a
word
for
the
most
ordinary
and
conventional
purposes
of
the
romantic
novelist
nor
is
this
the
only
instance
of
such
psychological
obtuseness
in
his
work
that
in
spite
of
this
initial
and
damning
defect
he
does
succeed
in
producing
a
fine
novel
is
but
one
more
proof
of
the
amazing
fecundity
of
his
genius
none
the
less
does
the
fact
remain
that
it
is
a
novel
so
to
speak
without
a
soul
that
so
far
from
being
of
the
essence
of
the
covenant
the
burleys
mucklewraths
mauses
and
macbrairs
are
but
so
many
of
its
accidents
and
that
thus
the
main
issues
of
the
historical
drama
are
not
involved
in
the
romance
in
other
words
it
is
as
though
the
tragedy
of
had
been
performed
with
great
skill
and
only
without
the
appearance
of
the
prince
of
denmark
upon
the
stage
and
thus
if
the
historical
novel
is
to
play
a
part
of
any
dignity
in
our
literature
we
may
safely
predict
that
it
is
upon
the
stock
here
supplied
by
galt
rather
than
upon
that
supplied
by
scott
in
that
it
will
have
to
be
grafted
having
now
assigned
to
our
author
the
credit
due
to
him
for
his
choice
and
general
treatment
of
a
fine
subject
it
remains
to
touch
briefly
upon
the
technical
skill
which
he
has
brought
to
bear
upon
the
handling
of
its
details
by
resorting
then
to
an
ingenious
and
yet
perfectly
natural
and
legitimate
device
he
has
contrived
to
extend
his
household
memorial
for
it
is
thus
that
he
describes
the
story
so
as
to
make
it
embrace
the
entire
period
of
the
religious
struggle
from
its
inception
under
the
regency
of
marie
of
lorraine
to
its
close
or
practical
close
under
the
rule
of
the
enlightened
and
tolerant
william
of
orange
a
period
in
all
of
full
one
hundred
and
thirty
years
for
the
narrative
opening
with
the
martyrdom
of
walter
mill
at
st
andrews
in
is
continued
to
the
death
of
claverhouse
at
killiecrankie
in
and
by
this
means
the
varying
phases
of
the
struggle
are
traced
almost
step
by
step
through
the
preachings
of
john
knox
and
the
early
outrages
to
the
comparative
lull
of
the
reign
of
james
the
first
of
england
and
thence
again
from
the
renewed
exasperating
of
opposition
by
the
shifty
and
infatuated
martyr
king
to
the
climax
of
the
killing
time
under
the
younger
of
his
sons
few
incidents
of
really
primary
or
representative
importance
are
omitted
and
the
skill
shown
by
the
author
in
stringing
the
pearls
of
history
upon
the
thread
of
his
narrative
is
not
the
least
of
the
merits
he
displays
but
as
should
be
in
a
novel
the
historical
never
overweights
the
human
or
fictitious
interest
but
is
always
properly
subordinated
to
it
we
have
spoken
elsewhere
of
galt
the
novelist
as
being
in
advance
of
his
time
a
facile
phrase
which
it
is
expedient
to
use
with
due
reserve
and
after
due
consideration
but
the
fact
that
the
author
with
whose
work
we
are
instinctively
impelled
to
compare
the
novel
of
is
the
great
chief
of
the
french
naturalistic
school
would
appear
at
least
so
far
to
support
that
characterisation
it
is
of
course
undeniable
that
at
the
outset
there
confront
us
several
striking
points
of
contrast
or
divergence
between
the
two
authors
for
example
of
that
amour
du
which
with
its
concomitants
was
for
so
long
and
perhaps
is
even
yet
regarded
by
the
general
public
as
zola
one
prominent
characteristic
of
this
galt
has
absolutely
nothing
his
preoccupation
being
uniformly
with
beauty
in
one
form
or
another
whether
of
matter
or
of
spirit
with
him
a
gloom
which
did
we
not
fear
to
be
less
than
just
to
galt
we
might
denominate
byronic
fills
perhaps
the
place
of
zola
pessimism
next
of
that
misbegotten
passion
for
the
painter
brush
which
has
vitiated
so
much
of
modern
french
writing
and
of
which
zola
in
inferior
works
has
even
more
than
his
due
share
the
novel
of
shows
equally
no
trace
on
the
contrary
its
brief
descriptive
passages
of
which
it
is
noticeable
how
many
are
nocturnal
or
crepuscular
or
paint
effects
of
mist
or
these
might
serve
as
models
at
once
in
their
breadth
of
execution
their
aptness
and
their
pregnancy
or
quality
of
moral
suggestiveness
of
what
descriptions
in
literature
should
be
how
different
from
those
laboured
outlines
laboriously
filled
in
of
such
a
piece
of
writing
as
so
much
then
for
the
divergence
of
the
two
authors
and
now
as
to
their
relationship
it
is
perhaps
in
their
power
of
putting
their
sense
of
a
multitude
before
the
reader
of
exhibiting
the
passions
by
which
that
multitude
is
animated
and
of
tracing
the
phases
and
fluctuations
of
that
passion
that
the
frenchman
or
italian
and
the
scot
come
first
and
most
strikingly
together
witness
in
this
book
the
scene
of
the
advance
of
the
congregations
to
the
trial
of
the
ministers
or
that
of
the
return
of
the
reformer
knox
to
scotland
this
of
itself
however
is
not
much
nor
should
we
have
felt
justified
in
drawing
special
attention
to
it
but
for
the
fact
that
it
seems
to
us
to
be
an
outward
and
visible
sign
of
what
is
a
vital
perhaps
vital
characteristic
of
either
writer
or
at
least
that
of
galt
in
this
book
and
of
zola
in
his
masterwork
it
is
associated
then
as
we
read
it
with
a
desire
to
rise
in
art
above
the
limitation
of
the
merely
individual
and
the
springs
of
this
desire
we
take
to
lie
in
that
noble
and
abounding
pity
which
is
the
dominant
passion
of
either
author
or
of
either
book
in
either
case
it
is
an
objective
or
artistic
pity
called
into
being
by
the
spectacle
of
human
suffering
as
specific
as
it
is
intolerable
to
contemplate
only
that
with
galt
it
is
felt
for
a
particular
historical
group
of
men
with
zola
for
a
particular
section
of
his
contemporaries
and
from
this
characteristic
there
naturally
results
a
gain
of
the
quality
of
artistic
grandeur
in
the
books
for
it
is
less
the
fortunes
of
the
individual
colliers
than
the
rights
of
labour
and
their
chances
of
recognition
which
form
the
true
theme
of
whilst
in
we
are
called
to
gaze
upon
nothing
less
than
the
grandiose
spectacle
of
a
nation
in
with
a
race
of
mansworn
sovereigns
hence
in
either
case
the
individual
characters
measured
by
the
greatness
of
the
issues
at
stake
sink
into
comparative
insignificance
but
this
very
insignificance
serves
to
illustrate
a
fundamental
truth
for
to
quote
the
words
of
a
great
modern
thinker
this
is
the
law
which
governs
humanity
an
immense
prodigality
in
regard
to
the
mere
individual
a
contemptuous
heaping
together
of
the
unit
of
human
life
he
continues
i
can
picture
to
myself
the
artificer
letting
great
quantities
of
his
material
go
to
waste
undisturbed
indeed
although
three
parts
of
it
fall
useless
to
the
ground
for
it
is
the
fate
of
the
vast
majority
of
the
human
race
to
serve
as
a
mere
on
which
destiny
may
celebrate
her
revel
or
rather
to
contribute
towards
the
making
up
of
one
of
those
numerous
persons
who
were
known
to
the
classical
drama
as
the
chorus
impressively
to
exhibit
this
truth
in
art
is
of
itself
to
accomplish
much
but
in
the
infinite
pathos
of
the
individual
lot
there
is
a
converse
side
to
every
great
drama
too
and
to
this
neither
of
our
writers
is
insensible
hence
it
is
that
against
the
shadowy
curtain
or
background
formed
by
the
crowded
and
suffering
masses
of
humanity
are
relieved
and
detached
such
tragic
silhouettes
as
those
of
ringan
and
of
la
maheude
in
the
nature
of
the
unrelenting
ordeal
to
which
each
of
these
is
subjected
they
are
identical
for
both
of
them
are
rich
only
in
human
affection
and
of
this
both
live
to
see
themselves
entirely
denuded
gilhaize
who
is
raised
above
the
struggle
for
mere
daily
bread

animated
by
a
spiritual
and
intellectual
passion
which
would
have
been
altogether
beyond
the
comprehension
of
the
miner
wife
of
montsou
but
that
he
is
on
that
account
the
nobler
or
more
interesting
figure
of
the
two
we
do
not
take
upon
us
to
say
neither
of
course
must
we
be
understood
to
insist
unduly
on
the
few
points
of
resemblance
in
two
books
which
after
all
are
in
so
many
respects
radically
unlike
there
is
a
lighter
side
to
galt
book
too

this
is
seen
principally
ere
the
stress
of
the
action
has
become
intense
in
the
adventures
of
the
astute
michael
gilhaize
at
this
point
in
his
narrative
it
is
probably
with
stevenson
that
galt
suggests
comparison
nor
is
it
any
disparagement
to
the
delightful
author
of
and
to
say
that
the
best
of
his
work
is
to
the
best
of
galt
as
a
clever
boy
to
that
of
a
clever
man
for
whilst
galt
presents
incident
with
all
or
nearly
all
the
charm
of
stevenson
he
is
master
besides
of
an
adult
psychology

which

i
it
is
a
thing
past
all
contesting
that
in
the
reformation
there
was
a
spirit
of
far
greater
carnality
among
the
champions
of
the
cause
than
among
those
who
in
later
times
so
courageously
under
the
lord
upheld
the
unspotted
banners
of
the
covenant
this
i
speak
of
from
the
remembrance
of
many
aged
persons
who
either
themselves
bore
a
part
in
that
war
with
the
worshippers
of
the
beast
and
his
image
or
who
had
heard
their
fathers
tell
of
the
heart
and
mind
wherewith
it
was
carried
on
and
could
thence
with
the
helps
of
their
own
knowledge
discern
the
spiritual
and
hallowed
difference
but
as
i
intend
mainly
to
bear
witness
to
those
passages
of
the
late
bloody
persecution
in
which
i
was
myself
both
a
soldier
and
a
sufferer
it
will
not
become
me
to
brag
of
our
motives
and
intents
as
higher
and
holier
than
those
of
the
great
elder
worthies
of
the
congregation
at
the
same
time
it
is
needful
that
i
should
rehearse
as
much
of
what
happened
in
the
troubles
of
the
reformation
as
in
its
effects
and
influences
worked
upon
the
issues
of
my
own
life
for
my
father
father
was
out
in
the
raids
of
that
tempestuous
season
and
it
was
by
him
and
from
the
stories
he
was
wont
to
tell
of
what
the
government
did
when
drunken
with
the
sorceries
of
the
gorgeous
roman
harlot
and
rampaging
with
the
wrath
of
moloch
and
of
belial
it
trampled
on
the
hearts
and
thought
to
devour
the
souls
of
the
subjects
that
i
first
was
taught
to
feel
know
and
understand
the
divine
right
of
resistance
he
was
come
of
a
stock
of
bein
burghers
in
lithgow
but
his
father
having
a
profitable
traffic
in
and
among
the
gallants
of
the
court
and
being
moreover
a
man
who
took
little
heed
of
the
truths
of
religion
he
continued
with
his
wife
in
the
delusions
of
the
papistical
idolatry
till
the
last
by
which
my
grandfather
young
soul
was
put
in
great
jeopardy
for
the
monks
of
that
time
were
eager
to
get
into
their
clutches
such
as
appeared
to
be
gifted
with
any
peculiar
gift
in
order
to
rear
them
for
stoops
and
posts
to
sustain
their
babylon
in
the
tower
and
structure
whereof
many
rents
and
cracks
were
daily
kithing
the
dominican
friars
who
had
a
rich
howf
in
the
town
seeing
that
my
grandfather
was
a
shrewd
and
sharp
child
of
a
comely
complexion
and
possessing
a
studious
observance
were
fain
to
wile
him
into
their
power
but
he
was
happily
preserved
from
all
their
snares
and
devices
in
a
manner
that
shows
how
wonderfully
the
lord
worketh
out
the
purposes
of
his
will
by
ways
and
means
of
which
no
man
can
fathom
the
depth
of
the
mysteries
besides
his
traffic
in
the
polished
garniture
of
my
grandfather
father
was
also
a
ferrier
and
enjoyed
a
repute
for
his
skill
in
the
maladies
of
horses
by
which
and
as
he
dwelt
near
the
on
the
south
side
of
the
street
fornent
the
grand
his
smiddy
was
the
common
haunt
of
the
belonging
to
the
nobles
frequenting
the
court
and
as
often
as
any
newcomers
to
the
palace
were
observed
in
the
town
some
of
the
monks
and
friars
belonging
to
the
different
convents
were
sure
to
come
to
the
smiddy
to
converse
with
their
grooms
and
to
hear
the
news
which
were
all
of
the
controversies
raging
between
the
priesthood
and
the
people
my
grandfather
was
then
a
little
boy
but
he
thirsted
to
hear
their
conversations
and
many
a
time
as
he
was
wont
to
tell
has
his
very
heart
been
raspet
to
the
quick
by
the
cruel
comments
in
which
those
cormorants
of
idolatry
indulged
themselves
with
respect
to
the
brave
spirit
of
the
reformers
and
he
rejoiced
when
any
retainers
of
the
protestant
lords
quarrelled
with
them
and
dealt
back
to
them
as
hard
names
as
the
odious
epithets
with
which
the
friars
reviled
the
pious
challengers
of
the
papal
iniquities
thus
it
was
in
the
green
years
of
his
childhood
that
the
same
sanctified
spirit
was
poured
out
upon
him
which
roused
so
many
of
the
true
and
faithful
to
resist
and
repel
the
attempt
to
quench
the
relighted
lamps
of
the
gospel
preparing
his
young
courage
to
engage
in
those
great
first
trials
and
strong
tasks
of
the
lord
the
tidings
and
the
bickerings
to
which
he
was
a
hearkener
in
the
smiddy
he
was
in
the
practice
of
relating
to
his
companions
by
which
it
came
to
pass
that
it
might
in
a
manner
be
said
all
the
boys
in
the
town
were
leagued
in
spirit
with
the
reformers
and
the
consequences
were
not
long
of
ripening
in
those
days
there
was
a
popish
saint
one
st
michael
that
was
held
in
wonderful
love
and
adoration
by
all
the
ranks
and
hierarchies
of
the
ecclesiastical
locust
then
in
lithgow
indeed
for
that
matter
they
ascribed
to
him
power
and
dominion
over
the
whole
town
lauding
and
worshipping
him
as
their
special
god
and
protector
and
upon
a
certain
day
of
the
year
they
were
wont
to
make
a
great
pageant
and
revel
in
honour
of
this
supposed
saint
and
to
come
forth
from
their
cloisters
with
banners
and
with
censers
burning
incense
shouting
and
singing
paternosters
in
praise
of
this
their
dagon
walking
in
procession
from
kirk
to
kirk
as
if
they
were
celebrating
the
triumph
of
some
mighty
conqueror
this
annual
abomination
happening
to
take
place
shortly
after
the
martyrdom
of
that
true
saint
and
gospel
preacher
mr
george
wishart
and
while
kirk
and
quire
were
resounding
to
the
great
indignation
of
all
christians
with
lamentations
for
the
death
of
the
cruel
cardinal
beaton
his
ravenous
persecutor
the
monks
and
friars
received
but
little
homage
as
they
passed
along
triumphing
though
the
streets
were
as
usual
filled
with
the
multitude
to
see
their
fine
show
they
suffered
however
no
molestation
nor
contempt
till
they
were
passing
the
earl
of
angus
house
on
the
outside
stair
of
which
my
grandfather
with
some
two
or
three
score
of
other
innocent
children
was
standing
and
even
there
they
might
perhaps
have
been
suffered
to
go
by
scaithless
but
for
an
accident
that
befel
the
bearer
of
a
banner
on
which
was
depicted
a
blasphemous
type
of
the
holy
ghost
in
the
shape
and
lineaments
of
a
it
chanced
that
the
bearer
of
this
blazon
of
iniquity
was
a
particular
fat
monk
of
an
arrogant
nature
with
the
crimson
complexion
of
surfeit
and
constipation
who
for
many
causes
and
reasons
was
held
in
greater
aversion
than
all
the
rest
especially
by
the
boys
that
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
making
him
a
scoff
and
a
scorn
and
it
so
fell
out
as
he
was
coming
proudly
along
turning
his
babylonish
banner
to
pleasure
the
women
at
the
windows
to
whom
he
kept
nodding
and
winking
as
he
passed
that
his
foot
slipped
and
down
he
fell
as
it
were
with
a
gludder
at
which
all
the
thoughtless
innocents
on
the
earl
of
angus
stair
set
up
a
loud
shout
of
triumphant
laughter
and
from
less
to
more
began
to
hoot
and
yell
at
the
whole
pageant
and
to
pelt
some
of
the
performers
with
unsavoury
missiles
this
by
those
inordinate
ministers
of
oppression
was
deemed
a
horrible
sacrilege
and
the
parents
of
all
the
poor
children
were
obligated
to
give
them
up
to
punishment
of
which
none
suffered
more
than
did
my
grandfather
who
was
not
only
persecuted
with
stripes
till
his
loins
were
black
and
blue
but
cast
into
a
dungeon
in
the
blackfriars
den
where
for
three
days
and
three
nights
he
was
allowed
no
sustenance
but
gnawed
crusts
and
foul
water
the
stripes
and
terrors
of
the
oppressor
are
however
the
seeds
which
providence
sows
in
its
mercy
to
grow
into
the
means
that
shall
work
his
own
overthrow
the
persecutions
which
from
that
day
the
monks
waged
in
their
conclaves
of
sloth
and
sosherie
against
the
children
of
the
town
denouncing
them
to
their
parents
as
worms
of
the
great
serpent
and
heirs
of
perdition
only
served
to
make
their
young
spirits
burn
fiercer
as
their
joints
hardened
and
their
sinews
were
knit
their
hearts
grew
manful
and
yearned
as
my
grandfather
said
with
the
zealous
longings
of
a
righteous
revenge
to
sweep
them
away
from
the
land
as
with
a
whirlwind
after
enduring
for
several
years
great
affliction
in
his
father
house
from
his
mother
a
termagant
woman
who
was
entirely
under
the
dominion
of
her
confessor
my
grandfather
entered
into
a
paction
with
two
other
young
lads
to
quit
their
homes
for
ever
and
to
enter
the
service
of
some
of
those
pious
noblemen
who
were
then
active
in
procuring
adherents
to
the
protestant
cause
as
set
forth
in
the
first
covenant
accordingly
one
morning
in
the
spring
of
they
bade
adieu
to
their
fathers
doors
and
set
forward
on
foot
towards
edinburgh
we
had
light
hearts
said
my
grandfather
for
our
trust
was
in
heaven
we
had
girded
ourselves
for
a
holy
enterprise
and
the
confidence
of
our
souls
broke
forth
into
songs
of
battle
the
melodious
breathings
of
that
unison
of
spirit
which
is
alone
known
to
the
soldiers
of
the
great
captain
of
salvation
about
noon
they
arrived
at
the
cross
of
edinburgh
where
they
found
a
crowd
assembled
round
the
luckenbooths
waiting
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
states
which
were
then
deliberating
anent
the
proposal
from
the
french
king
that
the
prince
dolphin
his
son
should
marry
our
young
queen
the
fair
and
faulty
mary
whose
doleful
captivity
and
woful
end
scarcely
expiated
the
sins
and
sorrows
that
she
caused
to
her
and
poor
misgoverned
native
realm
of
scotland
while
they
were
standing
in
this
crowd
my
grandfather
happened
to
see
one
icener
cunningham
a
servant
in
the
household
of
the
earl
of
glencairn
and
having
some
acquaintance
of
the
man
before
at
lithgow
he
went
towards
him
and
after
some
common
talk
told
on
what
errand
he
and
his
two
companions
had
come
to
edinburgh
it
was
in
consequence
agreed
between
them
that
this
icener
should
speak
to
his
master
concerning
them
the
which
he
did
as
soon
as
my
lord
came
out
from
the
parliament
and
the
earl
was
so
well
pleased
with
the
looks
of
the
three
young
men
that
he
retained
them
for
his
service
on
the
spot
and
they
were
conducted
by
icener
cunningham
home
to
his
lordship
lodgings
in
st
mary
wynd
thus
was
my
grandfather
enlisted
into
the
cause
of
the
lords
of
the
congregation
and
in
the
service
of
that
great
champion
of
the
reformation
the
renowned
valiant
and
pious
earl
of
glencairn
he
saw
many
of
those
things
the
recital
of
which
kindled
my
young
mind
to
flame
up
with
no
less
ardour
than
his
against
the
cruel
attempt
that
was
made
in
our
own
day
and
generation
to
load
the
neck
of
scotland
with
the
grievous
chains
of
prelatic
tyranny
chapter
ii
the
earl
of
glencairn
having
much
to
do
with
the
other
lords
of
the
congregation
did
not
come
to
his
lodging
till
late
in
the
afternoon
when
as
soon
as
he
had
passed
into
his
privy
chamber
he
sent
for
his
three
new
men
and
entered
into
some
conversation
with
them
concerning
what
the
people
at
lithgow
said
and
thought
of
the
government
and
the
proceedings
at
that
time
afoot
on
behalf
of
the
reformed
religion
but
my
grandfather
jealoused
that
in
this
he
was
less
swayed
by
the
expectation
of
gathering
knowledge
from
them
than
by
a
wish
to
inspect
their
discretion
and
capacities
for
after
conversing
with
them
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
or
thereby
he
dismissed
them
courteously
from
his
presence
without
intimating
that
he
had
any
special
service
for
them
to
perform
one
evening
as
the
earl
sat
alone
at
supper
he
ordered
my
grandfather
to
be
brought
again
before
him
and
desired
him
to
be
for
that
night
in
this
situation
as
my
grandfather
stood
holding
the
chalice
and
flagon
at
his
left
elbow
the
earl
as
was
his
wonted
custom
with
such
of
the
household
as
he
from
time
to
time
so
honoured
entered
into
familiar
conversation
with
him
and
when
the
servitude
and
homages
of
the
supper
were
over
and
the
servants
were
removing
the
plate
and
trenchers
he
signified
by
a
look
and
a
whisper
that
he
wished
him
to
linger
in
the
room
till
after
they
were
gone
gilhaize
said
he
when
the
had
retired
and
they
were
by
themselves
i
am
well
content
with
your
prudence
and
therefore
before
you
are
known
to
belong
to
my
train
i
would
send
you
on
a
confidential
errand
for
which
you
must
be
ready
to
set
forth
this
very
night
my
grandfather
made
no
reply
in
words
to
this
mark
of
trust
but
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
his
obedience
to
the
commands
of
the
earl
i
need
not
tell
you
resumed
his
master
that
among
the
friends
of
the
reformed
cause
there
are
some
for
policy
and
many
for
gain
and
that
our
adversaries
knowing
this
leave
no
device
or
stratagem
untried
to
sow
sedition
among
the
lords
and
leaders
of
the
congregation
this
very
day
the
earl
of
argyle
has
received
a
letter
from
that
dissolute
papist
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
entreating
him
with
many
sweet
words
concerning
the
ancient
friendship
subsisting
between
their
families
to
banish
from
his
protection
that
good
and
pious
proselyte
douglas
his
chaplain
evidently
presuming
from
the
easy
temper
of
the
aged
earl
that
he
may
be
wrought
into
compliance
but
argyle
is
an
honest
man
and
is
this
night
to
return
by
the
archbishop
messenger
and
kinsman
sir
david
hamilton
a
fitting
and
proper
reply
it
is
not
however
to
be
thought
that
this
attempt
to
tamper
with
argyle
is
the
sole
trial
which
the
treacherous
priest
is
at
this
time
making
to
breed
distrust
and
dissension
among
us
though
as
yet
we
have
heard
of
none
other
now
gilhaize
what
i
wish
you
to
do
and
i
think
you
can
do
it
well
is
to
throw
yourself
in
sir
david
way
and
by
hook
or
crook
get
with
him
to
st
andrews
and
there
try
by
all
expedient
means
to
gain
a
knowledge
of
what
the
archbishop
is
at
this
time
plotting
for
plotting
we
are
assured
from
this
symptom
he
is
and
it
is
needful
to
the
cause
of
christ
that
his
wiles
should
be
circumvented
in
saying
these
words
the
earl
rose
and
taking
a
key
from
his
belt
opened
a
coffer
that
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
took
out
two
pieces
of
gold
which
he
delivered
to
my
grandfather
to
bear
the
expenses
of
his
journey
i
give
you
gilhaize
said
he
no
farther
instructions
for
unless
i
am
mistaken
in
my
man
you
lack
no
better
guide
than
your
own
discernment
so
god
be
with
you
and
his
blessing
prosper
the
undertaking
my
grandfather
was
much
moved
at
being
so
trusted
and
doubted
in
his
own
breast
if
he
was
qualified
for
the
duty
which
his
master
had
thus
put
upon
him
nevertheless
he
took
heart
from
the
earl
confidence
and
without
saying
anything
either
to
his
two
companions
or
to
icener
cunningham
he
immediately
on
parting
from
his
master
left
the
house
leaving
his
absence
to
be
accounted
for
to
the
servants
according
to
his
lord
pleasure
having
been
several
times
on
errands
of
his
father
in
edinburgh
before
he
was
not
with
the
town
and
the
moon
being
up
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
his
way
to
habby
bridle
a
noted
stabler
at
the
foot
of
leith
wynd
nigh
the
mouth
of
the
north
loch
where
gallants
and
other
travellers
of
gentle
condition
commonly
put
up
their
horses
there
he
thought
it
was
likely
sir
david
hamilton
had
stabled
his
steed
and
he
divined
that
by
going
thither
he
would
learn
whether
that
knight
had
set
forward
to
fife
or
when
he
was
expected
so
to
do
the
which
movement
he
always
said
was
nothing
short
of
an
instinct
from
heaven
for
just
on
entering
the
stabler
yard
a
groom
came
shouting
to
the
hostler
to
get
sir
david
hamilton
horses
saddled
outright
as
his
master
was
coming
thus
without
the
exposure
of
any
inquiry
he
gained
the
tidings
that
he
wanted
and
with
what
speed
he
could
put
into
his
heels
he
went
forward
to
the
pier
of
leith
where
he
found
a
bark
with
many
passengers
on
board
ready
to
set
sail
for
kirkcaldy
waiting
only
for
the
arrival
of
sir
david
to
whom
as
the
archbishop
kinsman
the
boatmen
were
fain
to
pretend
a
great
outward
respect
but
many
a
bitter
ban
my
grandfather
said
they
gave
him
for
taigling
them
so
long
while
wind
and
tide
both
served
all
which
was
proof
and
evidence
how
much
the
hearts
of
the
common
people
were
then
alienated
from
the
papistical
churchmen
sir
david
having
arrived
and
his
horses
being
taken
aboard
the
bark
set
sail
and
about
daybreak
next
morning
she
came
to
anchor
at
kirkcaldy
during
the
voyage
my
grandfather
who
was
of
a
mild
and
comely
aspect
observed
that
the
knight
was
more
affable
towards
him
than
to
the
lave
of
the
passengers
the
most
part
of
whom
were
coopers
going
to
dundee
to
prepare
for
the
summer
fishing
among
them
was
one
patrick
girdwood
the
deacon
of
the
craft
a
most
comical
character
so
vogie
of
his
honours
and
dignities
in
the
town
council
that
he
could
not
get
the
knight
told
often
enough
what
a
load
aboon
the
burden
he
had
in
keeping
a
things
douce
and
in
right
regulation
amang
the
bailies
but
sir
david
fashed
at
his
clatter
and
to
be
quit
of
him
came
across
the
vessel
and
began
to
talk
to
my
grandfather
although
by
his
apparel
he
was
no
meet
companion
for
one
of
a
knight
degree
it
happened
that
sir
david
was
pleased
with
his
conversation
which
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
for
in
his
old
age
when
i
knew
him
he
was
a
man
of
a
most
enticing
mildness
of
manner
and
withal
so
discreet
in
his
sentences
that
he
could
not
be
heard
without
begetting
respect
for
his
observance
and
judgment
so
out
of
the
vanity
of
that
vogie
tod
of
the
town
council
was
a
mean
thus
made
by
providence
to
further
the
ends
and
objects
of
the
reformation
in
so
far
as
my
grandfather
was
concerned
for
the
knight
took
a
liking
to
him
and
being
told
as
it
was
expedient
to
give
a
reason
for
his
journey
to
st
andrews
that
he
was
going
thither
to
work
as
a
ferrier
sir
david
promised
him
not
only
his
own
countenance
but
to
commend
him
to
the
archbishop
there
was
at
that
time
in
kirkcaldy
one
tobit
balmutto
a
of
whom
my
grandfather
had
some
knowledge
by
report
this
tobit
being
much
resorted
to
by
the
courtiers
going
to
and
coming
from
falkland
and
well
known
to
their
who
were
wont
to
speak
of
him
in
the
smiddy
at
lithgow
as
a
zealous
reformer
chiefly
as
the
prodigals
among
them
used
to
jeer
and
say
because
the
priests
and
friars
in
their
journeyings
atween
st
andrews
and
edinburgh
took
the
use
of
his
beasts
without
paying
for
them
giving
him
only
their
feckless
benisons
instead
of
white
money
to
this
man
my
grandfather
resolved
to
apply
for
a
horse
and
such
a
one
if
possible
as
would
be
able
to
carry
him
as
fast
as
sir
david
hamilton
accordingly
on
getting
to
the
land
he
inquired
for
tobit
balmutto
and
several
of
his
striplings
and
hostlers
being
on
the
shore
having
on
seeing
the
bark
arrive
come
down
to
look
out
for
travellers
that
might
want
horses
he
was
conducted
by
one
of
them
to
their
employer
whom
he
found
an
elderly
man
of
the
corpulent
order
sitting
in
an
by
the
fireside
toasting
an
oaten
bannock
on
a
pair
of
tormentors
with
a
blue
bonnet
on
his
head
and
his
grey
hose
undrawn
up
whereby
his
hairy
legs
were
bare
showing
a
power
and
girth
such
as
my
grandfather
had
seen
few
like
before
testifying
to
what
had
been
the
deadly
strength
of
their
possessor
in
his
younger
years
he
was
thought
to
have
been
an
of
the
boswells
of
balmutto
when
he
had
made
known
his
want
to
tobit
and
that
he
was
in
a
manner
obligated
to
be
at
st
andrews
as
soon
as
sir
david
hamilton
the
withdrew
the
bannock
from
before
the
ribs
and
seeing
it
somewhat
scowthert
and
blackent
on
the
one
cheek
he
took
it
off
the
tormentors
and
scraped
it
with
them
and
blew
away
the
brown
burning
before
he
made
any
response
then
he
turned
round
to
my
grandfather
and
looking
at
him
with
the
tail
of
his
eye
from
aneath
his
broad
bonnet
said
then
ye
no
in
the
service
of
his
grace
my
lord
the
archbishop
and
yet
frien
i
think
na
ye
just
a
peer
to
sir
davie
that
you
need
to
ettle
at
coping
with
his
braw
mare
whilk
i
selt
to
him
mysel
but
the
a
bawbee
hae
i
yet
o
the
price
howsever
that
neither
here
nor
there
a
day
of
reckoning
will
come
at
last
my
grandfather
assured
tobit
balmutto
it
was
indeed
very
true
he
was
not
in
the
service
of
the
archbishop
and
that
he
would
not
have
been
so
instant
about
getting
to
st
andrews
with
the
knight
had
he
not
a
dread
and
fear
that
sir
david
was
the
bearer
of
something
that
might
be
sore
news
to
the
flock
o
christ
and
he
was
fain
to
be
there
as
soon
as
him
to
speak
in
time
of
what
he
jealoused
that
any
of
those
in
the
town
who
stood
within
the
reverence
of
the
archbishop
aversion
on
account
of
their
religion
might
get
an
inkling
and
provide
for
themselves
if
that
your
errand
said
the
ye
hae
the
swiftest
foot
in
my
aught
to
help
you
on
and
i
redde
you
no
to
spare
the
spur
for
i
troubled
to
think
ye
may
be
owre
late
satan
or
they

upon
him

been
heating
his
cauldrons
yonder
for
a
brewing
and
the
archbishop
thrang
providing

nae
farther
gane
than
yesterday
auld
worthy
mr
mill
of
lunan
being
discovered
hidden
in
a
kiln
at
dysart
was
they
say
in
a
cart
like
a
malefactor
by
twa
uncircumcised
loons
servitors
to
his
grace
and
it
thought
it
will
go
hard
wi
him
on
account
of
his
great
godliness
so
mak
what
haste
ye
dow
and
the
lord
put
mettle
in
the
beast
that
bears
you
with
that
tobit
balmutto
ordered
the
lad
who
brought
my
grandfather
to
the
house
to
saddle
a
horse
that
he
called
spunkie
and
in
a
trice
he
was
mounted
and
on
the
road
after
sir
david
whom
he
overtook
notwithstanding
the
spirit
of
his
mare
before
he
had
cleared
the
town
of
pathhead
and
they
travelled
onward
at
a
brisk
trot
together
the
knight
waxing
more
and
more
pleased
with
his
companion
in
so
much
that
by
the
time
they
had
reached
cupar
where
they
stopped
to
corn
he
lamented
that
a
young
man
of
his
parts
should
think
of
following
the
slavery
of
a
ferrier
life
when
he
might
rise
to
trusts
and
fortune
in
the
house
of
some
of
the
great
men
of
the
time
kindly
offering
to
procure
for
him
on
their
arrival
at
st
andrews
the
favour
and
patronage
of
his
kinsman
the
archbishop
chapter
iii
it
was
the
afternoon
when
my
grandfather
and
sir
david
hamilton
came
in
sight
of
st
andrews
and
the
day
being
loun
and
bright
the
sky
clear
and
the
sea
calm
he
told
me
that
when
he
saw
the
many
lofty
spires
and
towers
and
glittering
pinnacles
of
the
town
rising
before
him
he
verily
thought
he
was
approaching
the
city
of
jerusalem
so
grand
and
glorious
was
the
apparition
which
they
made
in
the
sunshine
and
he
approached
the
barricaded
gate
with
a
strange
movement
of
awe
and
wonder
rushing
through
the
depths
of
his
spirit
they
however
entered
not
into
the
city
at
that
time
but
passing
along
the
wall
leftward
came
to
a
road
which
led
to
the
gate
of
the
castle
where
the
archbishop
then
dwelt
and
as
they
were
approaching
towards
it
sir
david
pointed
out
the
window
where
cardinal
beaton
sat
in
the
pomp
of
his
scarlet
and
fine
linen
to
witness
the
heretic
wishart
as
the
knight
called
that
holy
man
burnt
for
his
sins
and
abominations
my
grandfather
on
hearing
this
drew
his
bridle
in
and
falling
behind
sir
david
raised
his
cap
in
reverence
and
in
sorrow
at
the
thought
of
passing
over
the
ground
that
had
been
so
hallowed
by
martyrdom
but
he
said
nothing
for
he
knew
that
his
thoughts
were
full
of
offence
to
those
who
were
wrapt
in
the
errors
and
delusions
of
popery
like
sir
david
hamilton
and
moreover
he
had
thanked
the
lord
thrice
in
the
course
of
their
journey
for
the
favour
which
it
had
pleased
him
he
should
find
in
the
sight
of
the
kinsman
of
so
great
an
adversary
to
the
truth
as
was
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
whose
treasons
and
treacheries
against
the
church
of
christ
he
was
then
travelling
to
discover
and
waylay
on
reaching
the
they
alighted
my
grandfather
springing
lightly
from
the
saddle
took
hold
of
sir
david
mare
by
the
while
the
knight
went
forward
and
whispered
something
concerning
his
grace
to
a
stalwart
that
stood
warder
of
the
port
leaning
on
his
sword
the
blade
of
whilk
could
not
be
shorter
than
an
ell
what
answer
he
got
was
brief
the
ancient
warrior
pointing
at
the
same
time
with
his
right
hand
towards
a
certain
part
of
the
city
and
giving
a
belial
smile
of
significance
whereupon
sir
david
turned
round
without
going
into
the
court
of
the
castle
and
bidding
my
grandfather
give
the
man
the
beasts
and
follow
which
he
did
they
walked
together
under
the
town
wall
towards
the
east
till
they
came
to
a
narrow
sallyport
in
the
rampart
wherewith
the
priory
and
cathedral
had
of
old
been
fenced
about
with
turrets
and
bastions
of
great
strength
against
the
lawless
kerns
of
the
highlands
and
especially
the
ships
of
the
english
who
have
in
all
ages
been
of
a
nature
gleg
and
glad
to
mulct
and
molest
the
towns
of
scotland
on
coming
to
the
sallyport
sir
david
chapped
with
his
whip
twice
and
from
within
a
wicket
was
opened
in
the
doors
ribbed
with
iron
stainchers
on
the
outside
and
a
man
with
the
sound
of
corpulency
in
his
voice
looked
through
and
inquired
what
they
wanted
seeing
however
who
it
was
that
had
knocked
he
forthwith
drew
the
bar
and
allowed
them
to
enter
which
was
into
a
pleasant
policy
adorned
with
jonquils
and
and
all
manner
of
blooming
and
odoriferous
plants
most
voluptuous
to
the
smell
and
ravishing
to
behold
the
scents
and
fragrancies
whereof
smote
my
grandfather
for
a
time
as
he
said
with
the
very
anguish
of
delight
but
on
looking
behind
to
see
who
had
given
them
admittance
he
was
astounded
when
instead
of
an
armed
and
mailed
soldier
as
he
had
thought
the
sentinel
there
placed
was
he
saw
a
large
elderly
monk
sitting
on
a
bench
with
a
broken
pasty
smoking
on
a
platter
beside
him
and
a
rotterdam
greybeard
jug
standing
by
no
doubt
plenished
with
cordial
drink
sir
david
held
no
parlance
with
the
feeding
friar
but
going
straight
up
the
walk
to
the
door
of
a
lodging
to
the
which
this
was
the
parterre
and
garden
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
sneck
and
opening
it
bade
my
grandfather
come
in
they
then
went
along
the
trance
towards
an
open
room
and
on
entering
it
they
met
a
fair
damsel
in
the
garb
of
a
handmaid
to
whom
the
knight
spoke
in
familiarity
and
kittling
her
under
the
chin
made
her
giggle
in
a
wanton
manner
by
her
he
was
informed
that
the
archbishop
was
in
the
inner
chamber
at
dinner
with
her
mistress
upon
which
he
desired
my
grandfather
to
sit
down
while
he
went
ben
to
his
grace
the
room
where
my
grandfather
took
his
seat
was
parted
from
the
inner
chamber
in
which
the
archbishop
and
his
lemane
were
at
their
festivities
by
an
arras
partition
so
that
he
could
hear
all
that
passed
within
and
the
first

came
forth

chamber
with
the
letter
in
his
hand
but
seeing
my
grandfather
whom
it
would
seem
he
had
forgotten
he
went
suddenly
back
and
said
to
his
grace
please
you
my
lord
i
hae
brought
with
me
a
young
man
of
a
good
capacity
and
a

he
is
here
in
the
outer
room
waiting

pleasure
davie
hamilton
replied
the
archbishop
ye
sometimes
lack
discretion
what
for
did
ye
bring
a
stranger
into
this
house
knowing
as
ye
ought
to
do
that
i
come
hither
but
when
i
o
a
sickly
frame
in
need
o
solace
and
repose
howsever
since
the
lad
there
bid
him
come
ben
upon
this
sir
david
came
out
and
beckoned
my
grandfather
to
go
in
and
when
he
went
forward
he
saw
none
in
that
inner
chamber
but
his
grace
and
the
mrs
kilspinnie
with
whom
he
was
sitting
on
a
bedside
before
a
table
whereon
was
divers
silver
flagons
canisters
of
comfits
and
goblets
of
the
crystal
of
venetia
he
looked
sharp
at
my
grandfather
perusing
him
from
head
to
foot
who
put
on
for
the
occasion
a
face
of
modesty
and
reverence
but
he
was
none
daunted
for
all
his
eyes
were
awake
and
he
took
such
a
cognition
of
his
grace
as
he
never
afterwards
forgot
indeed
i
have
often
heard
him
say
that
he
saw
more
of
the
man
in
the
brief
space
of
that
interview
than
of
others
in
many
intromissions
and
he
used
to
depict
him
to
me
as
a
hale
carl
of
an
look
with
a
long
dark
beard
inclining
to
grey
his
abundant
hair
flowing
down
from
his
cowl
was
also
clouded
and
streaked
with
the
kithings
of
the
cranreuch
of
age
there
was
however
a
youthy
and
luscious
twinkling
in
his
eyes
that
showed
how
little
the
passage
of
winters
had
cooled
the
rampant
sensuality
of
his
nature
his
right
leg
which
was
naked
though
on
the
foot
was
a
slipper
of
spanish
leather
he
laid
mistress
kilspinnie
knees
as
he
threw
himself
back
against
the
pillar
of
the
bed
the
better
to
observe
and
converse
with
my
grandfather
and
she
like
another
delilah
began
to
prattle
it
with
her
fingers
casting
at
the
same
time
glances
unseen
by
her
papistical
paramour
towards
my
grandfather
who
as
i
have
said
was
a
comely
and
young
man
after
some
few
questions
as
to
his
name
and
parentage
the
prelate
said
he
would
give
him
his
livery
being
then
anxious
on
account
of
the
signs
of
the
times
to
fortify
his
household
with
stout
and
valiant
youngsters
and
bidding
him
draw
near
and
to
kneel
down
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
head
and
mumbled
a
benedicite
the
which
my
grandfather
said
was
as
the
smell
of
rottenness
to
his
spirit
the
lascivious
hirkos
then
wantoning
so
openly
with
his
adulterous
concubine
for
no
better
was
mistress
kilspinnie
her
husband
a
creditable
man
being
then
living
and
one
of
the
bailies
of
crail
nor
is
it
to
be
debated
that
the
scene
was
such
as
ought
not
to
have
been
seen
in
a
christian
land
but
in
those
days
the
blasphemous
progeny
of
the
roman
harlot
were
bold
with
the
audacious
sinfulness
of
their
parent
and
set
little
store
by
the
fear
of
god
or
the
contempt
of
man
it
was
a
sore
trial
and
a
struggle
in
the
bosom
of
my
grandfather
that
day
to
think
of
making
a
show
of
homage
and
service
towards
the
mitred
belial
and
high
priest
of
the
abominations
wherewith
the
realm
was
polluted
and
when
he
rose
from
under
his
paw
he
shuddered
and
felt
as
if
he
had
received
the
foul
erls
of
perdition
from
the
evil
one
many
a
bitter
tear
he
long
after
shed
in
secret
for
the
hypocrisy
of
that
hour
the
guilt
of
which
was
never
sweetened
to
his
conscience
even
by
the
thought
that
he
maybe
thereby
helped
to
further
the
great
redemption
of
his
native
land
in
the
blessed
cleansing
of
the
reformation
chapter
iv
sir
david
hamilton
conducted
my
grandfather
back
through
the
garden
and
the
sallyport
to
the
castle
where
he
made
him
acquainted
with
his
grace
seneschal
by
whom
he
was
hospitably
entertained
when
the
knight
had
left
them
together
receiving
from
him
a
cup
of
hippocras
and
a
plentiful
repast
the
like
of
which
for
the
savouriness
of
the
viands
was
seldom
seen
out
of
the
howfs
of
the
monks
the
seneschal
was
called
by
name
leonard
meldrum
and
was
a
most
douce
and
composed
character
well
stricken
in
years
and
though
engrained
with
the
errors
of
papistry
as
was
natural
for
one
bred
and
cherished
in
the
house
of
the
speaking
horn
of
the
beast
for
such
the
high
priest
of
st
andrews
was
well
likened
to
he
was
nevertheless
a
man
of
a
humane
heart
and
great
tenderness
of
conscience
the
while
my
grandfather
was
sitting
with
him
at
the
board
he
lamented
that
the
church
so
he
denominated
the
papal
abomination
was
so
far
gone
with
the
spirit
of
punishment
and
of
cruelty
as
rather
to
shock
men
minds
into
schism
and
rebellion
than
to
allure
them
back
into
worship
and
reverence
and
to
a
repentance
of
their
heresies
a
strain
of
discourse
which
my
grandfather
so
little
expected
to
hear
within
the
gates
and
precincts
of
the
guilty
castle
of
st
andrews
that
it
made
him
for
a
time
distrust
the
sincerity
of
the
old
man
and
he
was
very
guarded
in
what
he
himself
answered
thereto
leonard
meldrum
was
however
honest
in
his
way
and
rehearsed
many
things
which
had
been
done
within
his
own
knowledge
against
the
reformers
that
as
he
said
human
nature
could
not
abide
nor
the
just
and
merciful
heavens
well
pardon
thus
from
less
to
more
my
grandfather
and
he
fell
into
frank
communion
and
he
gave
him
such
an
account
of
the
bloody
cardinal
beaton
as
was
most
awful
to
hear
saying
that
his
then
present
master
with
all
his
faults
and
prodigalities
was
a
saint
of
purity
compared
to
that
rampagious
cardinal
the
which
to
hear
my
grandfather
thinking
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
lodging
of
madam
kilspinnie
was
seized
with
such
a
horror
thereat
that
he
could
partake
no
more
of
the
repast
before
him
and
he
was
likewise
moved
into
a
great
awe
and
wonder
of
spirit
that
the
lord
should
thus
in
the
very
chief
sanctuary
of
papistry
in
all
scotland
be
alienating
the
affections
of
the
servants
from
their
master
preparing
the
way
as
it
were
for
an
utter
desertion
and
desolation
to
ensue
they
afterwards
talked
of
the
latter
end
of
that
great
martyr
mr
george
wishart
and
the
seneschal
informed
him
of
several
things
concerning
the
same
that
were
most
edifying
though
sorrowful
to
hear
he
was
said
he
placed
under
my
care
and
methinks
i
shall
ever
see
him
before
me
so
meek
so
holy
and
so
goodly
was
his
aspect
he
was
of
tall
stature
black
haired
long
bearded
of
a
graceful
carriage
elegant
courteous
and
ready
to
teach
in
his
apparel
he
was
most
comely
and
in
his
diet
of
an
abstemious
temperance
on
the
morning
of
his
execution
when
i
gave
him
notice
that
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
have
the
sacrament
he
smiled
with
a
holiness
of
resignation
that
almost
melted
me
to
weep
i
then
invited
him
to
partake
of
my
breakfast
which
he
accepted
with
cheerfulness
saying
will
do
it
very
willingly
and
so
much
the
rather
because
i
perceive
you
to
be
a
good
christian
and
a
man
fearing
god
i
then
ordered
in
the
breakfast
and
he
said
beseech
you
for
the
love
you
bear
to
our
saviour
to
be
silent
a
little
while
till
i
have
made
a
short
exhortation
and
blessed
this
bread
we
are
to
eat
he
then
spoke
about
the
space
of
half
an
hour
of
our
saviour
death
and
passion
exhorting
me
and
those
who
were
present
with
me
to
mutual
love
and
holiness
of
life
and
giving
thanks
brake
the
bread
distributing
a
part
to
those
about
him
then
taking
a
cup
he
bade
us
remember
that
christ
blood
was
shed
to
wash
away
our
sins
and
tasting
it
himself
he
handed
it
to
me
and
i
likewise
partook
of
it
then
he
concluded
with
another
prayer
at
the
end
of
which
he
said
will
neither
drink
nor
eat
any
more
in
this
world
and
he
forthwith
entered
into
an
inner
chamber
where
his
bed
was
leaving
us
filled
with
admiration
and
sorrow
and
our
eyes
flowing
with
tears
to
this
the
seneschal
added
i
fear
i
fear
we
are
soon
to
have
another
scene
of
the
same
sort
for
the
bishops
of
murray
and
brechin
and
caithness
with
other
dignitaries
are
summoned
to
the
cathedral
to
sit
in
judgment
on
the
aged
priest
of
lunan
that
was
brought
hither
from
dysart
yestereen
and
from
the
head
the
newfangled
heresies
are
making
there
little
doubt
that
the
poor
auld
man
will
be
made
an
example
woes
me
far
better
would
it
be
an
they
would
make
an
example
of
the
like
of
the
earls
of
argyle
and
glencairn
by
whom
the
reprobates
are
so
encouraged
and
is
this
mill
inquired
my
grandfather
with
diffidence
for
his
heart
was
so
stung
with
what
he
heard
that
he
could
scarcely
feign
the
necessary
hypocrisy
which
the
peril
he
stood
in
required
is
this
mill
in
the
castle
sorry
am
i
to
say
it
replied
the
seneschal
and
under
my
keeping
but
i
darena
show
him
the
pity
that
i
would
fain
do
to
his
grey
hairs
and
aged
limbs
some
of
the
monks
of
the
priory
are
with
him
just
now
trying
to
get
him
to
recant
his
errors
with
the
promise
of
a
bein
provision
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
in
the
abbey
of
dunfermline
the
whilk
i
hope
our
blessed
lady
will
put
it
into
his
heart
to
accept
i
trust
said
my
grandfather
in
the
core
of
his
bosom
that
the
lord
will
fortify
him
to
resist
the
temptation
this
however
the
seneschal
heard
not
for
it
was
ejaculated
inwardly
and
he
subjoined
when
the
monks
go
away
i
will
take
you
in
to
see
him
for
truly
he
is
a
sight
far
more
moving
to
compassion
than
displeasure
whatsoever
his
sins
and
heresies
may
be
in
this
manner
for
the
space
of
more
than
an
hour
did
my
grandfather
hold
converse
and
communion
with
leonard
meldrum
in
whom
he
was
often
heard
to
say
there
was
more
of
the
leaven
of
a
sanctified
nature
than
in
the
disposition
of
many
zealous
and
professing
christians
when
the
two
shavlings
that
had
been
afflicting
master
mill
with
the
offer
of
the
wages
of
satan
were
departed
from
the
castle
the
seneschal
rose
and
bidding
my
grandfather
to
come
after
him
they
went
out
of
the
room
and
traversing
a
narrow
dark
passage
with
many
windings
came
to
the
foot
of
a
turnpike
stair
which
led
up
into
the
so
called
because
it
stood
farthermost
of
all
the
castle
in
the
sea
and
in
the
chamber
thereof
they
found
master
mill
alone
sitting
at
the
window
with
his
ancient
and
shrivelled
lean
hand
resting
on
the
sole
and
supporting
his
chin
as
he
looked
through
the
iron
stainchers
abroad
on
the
ocean
that
was
sleeping
in
a
blessed
tranquillity
around
all
glowing
and
golden
with
the
shimmer
of
the
setting
sun
how
fares
it
with
you
said
the
seneschal
with
a
kindly
accent
whereupon
the
old
man
who
had
not
heard
them
enter
being
tranced
in
his
own
holy
meditations
turned
round
and
my
grandfather
said
he
felt
himself
when
he
beheld
his
countenance
so
smitten
with
awe
and
admiration
that
he
could
not
for
some
time
advance
a
step
come
in
master
meldrum
and
sit
ye
down
by
me
said
the
godly
man
draw
near
unto
me
for
i
am
a
thought
hard
of
hearing
the
lord
has
of
late
by
steeking
the
doors
and
windows
of
my
earthly
tabernacle
been
admonishing
me
that
the
gloaming
is
come
and
the
hour
of
rest
can
not
be
far
off
his
voice
said
my
grandfather
was
as
the
sound
of
a
mournful
melody
but
his
countenance
was
brightened
with
a
solemn
joyfulness
he
was
of
a
pale
and
spiritual
complexion
his
eyes
beamed
as
it
were
with
a
living
light
and
often
glanced
thoughts
of
heavenly
imaginings
even
as
he
sat
in
silence
he
was
then
fourscore
and
two
years
old
but
his
appearance
was
more
aged
for
his
life
had
been
full
of
suffering
and
poverty
and
his
venerable
hands
and
skinny
arms
were
evidences
of
his
ineffectual
power
to
struggle
much
longer
in
the
warfare
of
this
world
in
sooth
he
was
a
chosen
ripened
and
ready
for
the
garnels
of
salvation
i
have
brought
master
mill
said
the
seneschal
a
discreet
youth
to
see
you
not
out
of
a
vain
curiosity
for
he
sorrows
with
an
exceeding
grief
that
such
an
aged
person
should
be
brought
into
a
state
of
so
great
jeopardy
but
i
hope
master
mill
it
will
go
well
with
you
yet
and
that
ye
repent
and
accept
the
boon
that
i
hae
heard
was
to
be
proffered
to
these
words
the
aged
saint
made
no
reply
for
the
space
of
about
a
minute
at
the
end
of
which
he
raised
his
hands
and
casting
his
eyes
heavenward
exclaimed
i
thank
thee
o
lord
for
the
days
of
sore
trial
and
want
and
hunger
and
thirst
and
destitution
which
thou
hast
been
pleased
to
bestow
upon
me
for
by
them
have
i
even
now
as
i
stand
on
the
threshold
of
life
been
enabled
through
thy
merciful
heartenings
to
set
at
nought
the
temptations
wherewith
i
have
been
tempted
and
turning
to
the
seneschal
he
added
mildly
but
i
am
bound
to
you
master
meldrum
in
great
obligations
for
i
know
that
in
the
hope
you
have
now
expressed
there
is
the
spirit
of
much
charitableness
albeit
you
discern
not
the
deadly
malady
that
the
sin
of
compliance
would
bring
to
my
poor
soul
no
sir
it
would
na
be
worth
my
while
now
for
gain
to
read
a
recantation
and
blessed
be
god
it
no
in
my
power
to
yield
so
deeply
are
the
truths
of
his
laws
engraven
upon
the
tablet
of
my
heart
they
then
fell
into
more
general
discourse
and
while
they
were
speaking
a
halberdier
came
into
the
room
with
a
paper
whereby
the
prisoner
was
summoned
to
appear
in
the
cathedral
next
day
by
ten
to
answer
divers
matters
of
heresy
and
schism
laid
to
his
charge
and
the
man
having
delivered
the
summons
said
to
the
seneschal
that
he
was
ordered
by
sir
andrew
oliphant
to
bid
him
refrain
from
visiting
the
prisoner
and
to
retire
to
his
own
lodging
the
seneschal
to
this
command
said
nothing
but
rose
and
my
grandfather
likewise
rose
fain
would
he
have
knelt
down
to
beg
the
blessing
of
the
martyr
but
the
worthy
master
meldrum
signified
to
him
with
a
look
to
come
at
once
away
and
when
they
were
returned
back
into
his
chamber
where
the
repast
had
been
served
he
told
him
that
there
was
a
danger
of
falling
under
the
evil
thoughts
of
oliphant
were
he
to
be
seen
evidencing
anything
like
respect
towards
prisoners
accused
of
the
sin
of
heresy
chapter
v
the
next
day
was
like
a
cried
fair
in
andrews
all
the
country
from
ayont
cupar
and
many
reformed
and
godly
persons
even
from
dundee
and
perth
were
gathered
into
the
city
to
hear
the
trial
of
master
walter
mill
the
streets
were
filled
with
horses
and
men
with
whips
in
their
hands
and
spurs
at
their
heels
and
there
was
a
great
going
to
and
fro
among
the
multitude
but
saving
in
its
numbers
the
congregation
of
the
people
was
in
no
other
complexion
either
like
a
fair
or
a
tryst
every
visage
was
darkened
with
doure
thoughts
none
spoke
cheerfully
aloud
but
there
was
whispering
and
muttering
and
ever
and
anon
the
auld
men
were
seen
wagging
their
heads
in
sorrow
while
the
young
cried
often
shame
shame
and
with
vehement
gestures
clave
the
air
with
their
right
hands
grasping
their
whips
and
staffs
with
the
vigour
of
indignation
at
last
the
big
bell
of
the
cathedral
began
to
jow
at
the
doleful
sound
of
which
there
was
for
the
space
of
two
or
three
minutes
a
silence
and
pause
in
the
multitude
as
if
they
had
been
struck
with
panic
and
consternation
for
till
then
there
was
a
hope
among
them
that
the
persecutors
would
relent
but
the
din
of
the
bell
was
as
the
signal
of
death
and
despair
and
the
people
were
soon
awakened
from
their
astonishment
by
the
cry
that
the
bishops
are
coming
whereat
there
was
a
great
rush
towards
the
gates
of
the
church
which
was
presently
filled
leaving
only
a
passage
up
the
middle
aisle
in
the
quire
a
table
was
spread
with
a
purple
velvet
cloth
and
at
the
upper
end
before
the
high
place
of
the
mass
was
a
stool
of
state
for
the
archbishop
on
each
side
stood
chairs
for
the
bishops
of
murray
brechin
and
caithness
and
his
other
suffragans
summoned
to
sit
in
judgment
with
him
my
grandfather
armed
and
wearing
the
archbishop
livery
was
with
those
that
guarded
the
way
for
the
cruel
prelates
and
by
the
pressure
of
the
throng
in
convoying
them
into
their
place
he
was
driven
within
the
screen
of
the
quire
and
saw
and
heard
all
that
passed
when
they
had
taken
their
seats
master
mill
was
brought
before
them
from
the
prior
chamber
whither
he
had
been
secretly
conducted
early
in
the
morning
to
the
end
that
his
great
age
might
not
be
seen
of
the
people
to
work
on
their
compassion
but
notwithstanding
the
forethought
of
this
device
when
he
came
in
his
white
hair
and
his
saintly
look
and
his
feeble
tottering
steps
softened
every
heart
even
the
very
legate
of
antichrist
the
archbishop
himself
my
grandfather
said
was
evidently
moved
and
for
a
season
looked
at
the
poor
infirm
old
man
as
he
would
have
spared
him
and
a
murmur
of
universal
commiseration
ran
through
the
church
on
being
taken
to
the
bottom
of
the
table
and
placed
fornent
the
archbishop
master
mill
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
support
in
a
voice
so
firm
and
clear
and
eloquent
that
all
present
were
surprised
for
it
rung
to
the
farthest
corner
of
that
great
edifice
and
smote
the
hearts
of
his
oppressors
as
with
the
dread
of
a
menacing
oracle
sir
andrew
oliphant
who
acted
as
clerk
and
chancellor
on
the
occasion
began
to
fret
as
he
heard
him
thus
strengthened
of
the
lord
and
cried
peevishly
sir
walter
mill
get
up
and
answer
for
you
keep
my
lords
here
too
long
he
however
heeded
not
this
command
but
continued
undisturbed
till
he
had
finished
his
devotion
when
he
rose
and
said
i
am
bound
to
obey
god
more
than
man
and
i
serve
a
mightier
lord
than
yours
you
call
me
sir
walter
but
i
am
only
walter
too
long
was
i
one
of
the
pope
knights
but
now
say
what
you
have
to
say
oliphant
was
somewhat
cowed
by
this
bold
reply
and
he
bowed
down
and
turning
over
his
papers
read
a
portion
of
one
of
them
to
himself
and
then
raising
his
head
said
what
thinkest
thou
of
priests
marriage
the
old
man
looked
bravely
towards
the
bishops
and
answered
with
an
intrepid
voice
i
esteem
marriage
a
blessed
bond
ordained
by
god
approved
by
christ
and
made
free
to
all
sorts
of
men
but
you
abhor
it
and
in
the
meantime
take
other
men
wives
and
daughters
you
vow
chastity
and
keep
it
not
my
grandfather
at
these
words
looked
unawares
towards
the
archbishop
thinking
of
what
he
had
seen
in
the
lodging
of
mistress
kilspinnie
and
their
eyes
chancing
to
meet
his
grace
turned
his
head
suddenly
away
as
if
he
had
been
rebuked
divers
other
questions
were
then
put
by
oliphant
touching
the
sacraments
the
idolatry
of
the
mass
and
transubstantiation
with
other
points
concerning
bishops
and
pilgrimages
and
the
worshipping
of
god
in
unconsecrated
places
to
all
which
master
mill
answered
in
so
brave
a
manner
contrary
to
the
papists
that
even
oliphant
himself
often
looked
reproved
and
confounded
at
last
the
choler
of
that
sharp
weapon
of
persecution
began
to
rise
and
he
said
to
him
sternly
if
you
will
not
recant
i
will
pronounce
sentence
against
you
i
know
replied
master
mill
with
an
apostolic
constancy
and
fortitude
i
know
that
i
must
die
once
and
therefore
as
christ
said
to
judas
what
thou
doest
do
quickly
you
shall
know
that
i
will
not
recant
the
truth
for
i
am
corn
and
not
chaff
i
will
neither
be
blown
away
by
the
wind
nor
burst
with
the
flail
but
will
abide
both
at
these
brave
words
a
sough
of
admiration
sounded
through
the
church
but
instead
of
deterring
the
prelates
from
proceeding
with
their
wicked
purpose
it
only
served
to
harden
their
hearts
and
to
rouse
their
anger
for
when
they
had
conferred
a
few
minutes
apart
oliphant
was
ordered
to
condemn
him
to
the
fire
and
to
deliver
him
over
to
the
temporal
magistrates
to
see
execution
done
no
sooner
was
the
sentence
known
than
a
cry
like
a
howl
of
wrath
rose
from
all
the
people
and
the
provost
of
the
town
who
was
present
with
the
bailies
hastily
quitted
the
church
and
fled
abhorring
the
task
and
fearful
it
would
be
put
upon
him
to
see
it
done
he
being
also
bailie
of
the
archbishop
regalities
when
the
sentence
was
pronounced
the
session
of
the
court
was
adjourned
and
the
bishops
as
they
were
guarded
back
to
the
castle
heard
many
a
malison
from
the
multitude
who
were
ravenous
against
them
the
aged
martyr
being
led
back
to
the
prior
chamber
was
under
cloud
of
night
taken
to
the
castle
but
my
grandfather
saw
no
more
of
him
nor
of
master
meldrum
the
seneschal
for
there
was
a
great
fear
among
the
bishops
men
that
the
multitude
would
rise
and
attempt
a
rescue
and
my
grandfather
not
being
inclined
to
go
so
far
with
his
disguise
as
to
fight
against
that
cause
took
occasion
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
to
slip
out
of
the
castle
and
to
hide
himself
in
the
town
being
resolved
after
what
he
had
witnessed
no
longer
to
abide
even
as
a
spy
in
a
service
which
his
soul
loathed
all
the
night
long
there
was
a
great
commotion
in
the
streets
and
lights
in
many
houses
and
a
sound
of
lamentation
mingled
with
rage
the
noise
was
as
if
some
dreadful
work
was
going
on
there
was
no
shouting
nor
any
sound
of
men
united
together
but
a
deep
and
hoarse
murmur
rose
at
times
from
the
people
like
the
sound
of
the
bandless
waves
of
the
sea
when
they
are
driven
by
the
strong
impulses
of
the
tempest
the
spirit
of
the
times
was
indeed
upon
them
and
it
was
manifest
to
my
grandfather
that
there
wanted
that
night
but
the
voice
of
a
captain
to
bid
them
hurl
their
wrath
and
vengeance
against
the
towers
and
strongholds
of
the
oppressors
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
garrison
of
the
castle
came
forth
and
on
the
spot
where
the
martyrdom
of
mr
george
wishart
had
been
accomplished
a
stake
was
driven
into
the
ground
and
faggots
and
barrels
of
tar
were
placed
around
it
piled
up
almost
as
high
as
a
man
in
the
middle
next
to
the
stake
a
place
was
left
for
the
sufferer
but
when
all
things
were
prepared
no
rope
could
be
had
no
one
in
all
the
town
would
give
or
sell
a
cord
to
help
that
sacrifice
of
iniquity
nor
would
any
of
the
magistrates
come
forth
to
see
the
execution
done
so
it
was
thought
for
a
time
that
the
hungry
cruelty
of
the
persecutors
would
be
disappointed
of
its
banquet
one
somerville
however
who
was
officer
of
the
archbishop
guard
bethought
himself
in
this
extremity
of
the
ropes
wherewith
his
master
pavilion
was
fastened
and
he
went
and
took
the
same
and
then
his
men
brought
forth
the
aged
martyr
at
the
sight
of
whom
the
multitude
set
up
a
dreadful
imprecation
the
roar
and
growling
groan
of
which
was
as
if
a
thousand
furious
tigresses
had
been
robbed
of
their
young
many
of
somerville
halberdiers
looked
cowed
and
their
faces
were
aghast
with
terror
and
some
cried
compassionately
as
they
saw
the
blessed
old
man
brought
with
his
hands
tied
behind
him
to
the
stake
recant
recant
the
monks
and
friars
of
the
different
monasteries
who
were
all
there
assembled
around
took
up
the
word
and
bitterly
taunting
him
cried
likewise
recant
recant
and
save
thyself
he
however
replied
to
them
with
an
awful
austerity
i
marvel
at
your
rage
ye
hypocrites
who
do
so
cruelly
pursue
the
servants
of
god
as
for
me
i
am
now
fourscore
and
two
years
old
and
by
course
of
nature
can
not
live
long
but
hundreds
shall
rise
out
of
my
ashes
who
shall
scatter
you
ye
persecutors
of
god
people
sir
andrew
oliphant
who
was
that
day
the
busiest
high
priest
of
the
horrible
sacrifice
at
these
words
pushed
him
forward
into
the
midst
of
the
faggots
and
fuel
around
the
stake
but
nothing
moved
by
this
remorseless
indignity
the
martyr
looked
for
a
moment
at
the
pile
with
a
countenance
full
of
cheerful
resignation
and
then
requested
permission
to
say
a
few
words
to
the
people
you
have
spoken
too
much
cried
oliphant
and
the
bishops
are
exceedingly
displeased
with
what
you
have
said
but
the
multitude
exclaimed
let
him
be
heard
let
him
speak
what
he
pleases
speak
and
heed
not
oliphant
at
which
he
looked
towards
them
and
said
dear
friends
the
cause
why
i
suffer
this
day
is
not
for
any
crime
laid
to
my
charge
though
i
acknowledge
myself
a
miserable
sinner
but
only
for
the
defence
of
the
truths
of
jesus
christ
as
set
forth
in
the
old
and
new
testaments
he
then
began
to
pray
and
while
his
eyes
were
shut
two
of
men
threw
a
cord
with
a
running
loop
round
his
body
and
bound
him
to
the
stake
the
fire
was
then
kindled
and
at
the
sight
of
the
smoke
the
multitude
uttered
a
shriek
of
anguish
and
many
ran
away
unable
to
bear
any
longer
the
sight
of
that
woful
tragedy
among
others
my
grandfather
also
ran
nor
halted
till
he
was
come
to
a
place
under
the
rocks
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
where
he
could
see
nothing
before
him
but
the
lonely
desert
of
the
calm
and
soundless
ocean
chapter
vi
many
a
time
did
my
grandfather
in
his
old
age
when
all
things
he
spoke
were
but
remembrances
try
to
tell
what
passed
in
his
bosom
while
he
was
sitting
alone
under
those
cliffy
rocks
gazing
on
the
silent
and
innocent
sea
thinking
of
that
dreadful
work
more
hideous
than
the
horrors
of
winds
and
waves
with
which
blinded
men
in
the
lusts
of
their
idolatry
were
then
blackening
the
ethereal
face
of
heaven
but
he
was
ever
unable
to
proceed
for
the
struggles
of
his
spirit
and
the
gushing
of
his
tears
verily
it
was
an
awful
thing
to
see
that
patriarchal
man
overcome
by
the
recollections
of
his
youth
and
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
of
the
papistical
cruelties
was
as
the
pouring
of
the
energy
of
a
new
life
into
the
very
soul
instigating
thoughts
and
resolutions
of
an
implacable
enmity
against
those
ruthless
adversaries
to
the
hopes
and
redemption
of
the
world
insomuch
that
while
yet
a
child
i
was
often
worked
upon
by
what
he
said
and
felt
my
young
heart
so
kindled
with
the
live
coals
of
his
godly
enthusiasm
that
he
himself
has
stopped
in
the
eloquence
of
his
discourse
wondering
at
my
fervour
then
he
would
lay
his
hand
upon
my
head
and
say
the
lord
had
not
gifted
me
with
such
zeal
without
having
a
task
in
store
for
my
riper
years
his
words
of
prophecy
as
shall
hereafter
appear
have
greatly
and
wonderfully
come
to
pass
but
it
is
meet
that
for
a
season
i
should
rehearse
what
ensued
to
him
for
his
story
is
full
of
solemnities
and
strange
accidents
having
rested
some
time
on
the
he
rose
and
walked
along
the
toilsome
shingle
scarcely
noting
which
way
he
went
his
thoughts
being
busy
with
the
martyrdom
he
had
witnessed
flushing
one
moment
with
a
glorious
indignation
and
fainting
the
next
with
despondent
reflections
on
his
own
friendless
state
for
he
looked
upon
himself
as
adrift
on
the
tides
of
the
world
believing
that
his
patron
the
earl
of
glencairn
would
to
a
surety
condemn
his
lack
of
fortitude
in
not
enduring
the
servitude
of
the
archbishop
after
having
been
in
so
miraculous
a
manner
accepted
into
it
even
as
if
providence
had
made
him
a
special
instrument
to
achieve
the
discoveries
which
the
lords
of
the
congregation
had
then
so
much
at
heart
and
while
he
was
walking
along
in
this
fluctuating
mood
he
came
suddenly
upon
a
man
who
was
sitting
as
he
had
so
shortly
before
been
himself
sad
and
solitary
gazing
on
the
sea
the
stranger
on
hearing
him
approach
rose
hastily
and
was
moving
quickly
away
but
my
grandfather
called
to
him
to
stop
and
not
to
be
afraid
for
he
would
harm
no
one
i
thought
said
the
melancholy
man
that
all
his
grace
retainers
were
at
the
execution
of
the
heretic
there
was
something
in
the
way
in
which
he
uttered
the
latter
clause
of
the
sentence
that
seemed
to
my
grandfather
as
if
he
would
have
made
use
of
better
and
fitter
words
and
therefore
to
encourage
him
into
confidence
he
replied
i
belong
not
to
his
grace
how
is
it
then
that
you
wear
his
livery
and
that
i
saw
you
with
sir
david
hamilton
enter
the
garden
of
that
misguided
woman
he
could
proceed
no
farther
for
his
heart
swelled
and
his
utterance
was
for
a
while
stifled
he
being
no
other
than
the
misfortunate
bailie
of
crail
whose
light
wife
had
sunk
into
the
depravity
of
the
archbishop
lemane
she
had
been
beguiled
away
from
him
and
her
five
babies
their
children
by
the
temptations
of
a
dominican
who
by
habit
and
repute
was
pandarus
to
his
grace
and
the
poor
man
had
come
to
try
if
it
was
possible
to
wile
her
back
my
grandfather
was
melted
with
sorrow
to
see
his
great
affection
for
the
unworthy
concubine
calling
to
mind
the
scene
of
her
harlotry
and
wanton
glances
and
he
reasoned
with
him
on
the
great
folly
of
vexing
his
spirit
for
a
woman
so
far
lost
to
all
shame
and
given
over
to
iniquity
but
still
the
good
man
of
crail
would
not
be
persuaded
but
used
many
earnest
entreaties
that
my
grandfather
would
assist
him
to
see
his
wife
in
order
that
he
might
remonstrate
with
her
on
the
eternal
perils
in
which
she
had
placed
her
precious
soul
my
grandfather
though
much
moved
by
the
importunity
of
that
weak
honest
man
nevertheless
withstood
his
entreaties
telling
him
that
he
was
minded
to
depart
forthwith
from
st
andrews
and
make
the
best
of
his
way
back
to
edinburgh
and
so
could
embark
in
no
undertaking
whatever
discoursing
on
that
subject
in
this
manner
they
strayed
into
the
fields
and
being
wrapt
up
in
their
conversation
they
heeded
not
which
way
they
went
till
turning
suddenly
round
the
corner
of
an
orchard
they
saw
the
castle
full
before
them
about
half
a
mile
off
and
a
dim
white
vapour
mounting
at
times
from
the
spot
still
surrounded
by
many
spectators
where
the
fires
of
martyrdom
had
burnt
so
fiercely
shuddering
and
filled
with
dread
my
grandfather
turned
away
and
seeing
several
countrymen
passing
he
inquired
if
all
was
over
yes
said
they
and
the
soldiers
are
slockening
the
ashes
but
a
the
waters
of
the
will
never
quench
in
scotland
the
flame
that
was
kindled
yonder
this
day
the
which
words
they
said
with
a
proud
look
thinking
my
grandfather
by
his
arms
and
gabardine
belonged
to
the
archbishop
household
but
the
words
were
as
manna
to
his
religious
soul
and
he
gave
inward
praise
and
thanks
that
the
selfsame
tragical
means
which
had
been
devised
to
terrify
the
reformers
was
thus
through
the
mysterious
wisdom
of
providence
made
more
emboldening
than
courageous
wine
to
fortify
their
hearts
for
the
great
work
that
was
before
them
nothing
however
farther
passed
but
changing
the
course
of
their
walk
my
grandfather
and
the
sorrowful
master
kilspinnie
for
so
the
poor
man
of
crail
was
called
went
back
and
entering
the
bow
at
the
shoegate
passed
on
towards
a
vintner
that
dwelt
opposite
to
the
convent
of
the
blackfriars
for
the
day
was
by
this
time
far
advanced
and
they
both
felt
themselves
in
need
of
some
refreshment
while
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
vintner
apartment
a
stripling
came
several
times
into
the
room
and
looked
hard
at
my
grandfather
and
then
went
away
without
speaking
this
was
divers
times
repeated
and
at
last
it
was
so
remarkable
that
even
master
kilspinnie
took
notice
of
him
observing
that
he
seemed
as
if
he
had
something
very
particular
to
communicate
if
an
opportunity
served
offering
at
the
same
time
to
withdraw
to
leave
the
room
clear
for
the
youth
to
tell
his
errand
my
grandfather
curiosity
was
by
this
strange
and
new
adventure
to
him
so
awakened
that
he
thought
what
his
companion
proposed
a
discreet
thing
so
the
honest
bailie
of
crail
withdrew
himself
and
going
into
the
street
left
my
grandfather
alone
no
sooner
was
he
gone
out
of
the
house
than
the
stripling
who
had
been
sorning
about
the
door
again
came
in
and
coming
close
up
to
my
grandfather
ear
said
with
a
significance
not
to
be
misconstrued
that
if
he
would
follow
him
he
would
take
him
to
free
quarters
where
he
would
be
more
kindly
entertained
my
grandfather
though
naturally
of
a
quiet
temperament
was
nevertheless
a
bold
and
brave
youth
and
there
was
something
in
the
mystery
of
this
message
for
such
he
rightly
deemed
it
that
made
him
fain
to
see
the
end
thereof
so
he
called
in
the
vintner
wife
and
paid
her
the
lawin
telling
her
to
say
to
the
friend
who
had
been
with
him
when
he
came
back
that
he
would
soon
return
the
vintner
wife
was
a
buxom
and
jolly
dame
and
before
taking
up
the
money
she
gave
a
pawkie
look
at
the
stripling
and
as
my
grandfather
and
he
were
going
out
at
the
door
she
hit
the
gilly
a
bilf
on
the
back
saying
it
was
a
trade
he
had
up
and
that
he
wasna
blate
to
wile
awa
her
customers
crying
after
him
i
redde
ye
warn
your
madam
that
gin
she
sends
you
here
again
i
maybe
let
his
grace
ken
that
her
cauldron
needs
clouting
however
the
graceless
gilly
but
laughed
at
the
vintner
wife
winking
as
he
patted
the
side
of
his
nose
with
his
which
testified
that
he
held
her
vows
of
vengeance
in
very
little
reverence
and
then
he
went
on
my
grandfather
following
they
walked
up
the
street
till
they
came
to
the
priory
yett
when
turning
down
a
wynd
to
the
left
he
led
my
grandfather
along
between
two
dykes
till
they
were
come
to
a
house
that
stood
by
itself
within
a
fair
garden
but
instead
of
going
to
the
door
in
an
honest
manner
he
bade
him
stop
and
going
forward
he
whistled
shrilly
and
then
flung
three
stones
against
a
butt
that
was
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
house
on
a
gauntrees
to
kep
rain
water
from
the
spouting
image
of
a
stone
puddock
that
vomited
what
was
gathered
from
the
roof
in
the
rones
and
soon
after
an
upper
casement
was
opened
and
a
damsel
looked
forth
she
however
said
nothing
to
the
stripling
but
she
made
certain
signs
which
he
understood
and
then
she
drew
in
her
head
shutting
the
casement
softly
and
he
came
back
to
my
grandfather
to
whom
he
said
it
was
not
commodious
at
that
time
for
him
to
be
received
into
the
house
but
if
he
would
come
back
in
the
dark
at
eight
all
things
would
be
ready
for
his
reception
to
this
suggestion
my
grandfather
made
no
scruple
to
assent
but
promised
to
be
there
and
he
bargained
with
the
lad
to
come
for
him
giving
him
at
the
same
time
three
placks
for
a
largess
he
then
returned
to
the
vintner
where
he
found
the
crail
man
sitting
waiting
for
him
and
the
vintner
wife
when
she
saw
him
so
soon
back
jeered
him
and
would
fain
have
been
jocose
which
he
often
after
thought
a
woful
immorality
considering
the
dreadful
martyrdom
of
a
godly
man
that
had
been
done
that
day
in
the
town
but
at
the
time
he
was
not
so
over
as
to
take
offence
at
what
she
said
indeed
as
he
used
to
say
sins
were
not
so
heinous
in
those
papistical
days
as
they
afterwards
became
when
men
lost
faith
in
penance
and
found
out
the
perils
of
purchased
pardons
chapter
vii
my
grandfather
having
as
i
have
told
a
compassion
for
the
silly
affection
wherewith
the
honest
man
of
crail
still
regarded
his
wanton
wife
told
him
the
circumstantials
of
his
adventure
with
the
stripling
without
however
letting
wot
he
had
discovered
that
the
invitation
was
from
her
the
which
was
the
case
for
the
damsel
who
looked
out
at
the
window
was
no
other
than
the
giglet
he
had
seen
in
her
lodging
when
he
went
thither
with
sir
david
hamilton
and
he
proposed
to
the
disconsolate
husband
that
he
should
be
his
friend
in
the
adventure
meaning
thereby
to
convince
the
unhappy
man
by
the
evidence
of
his
own
eyes
and
ears
that
her
concubinage
with
the
antichrist
was
a
blessed
riddance
to
him
and
his
family
at
first
master
kilspinnie
had
no
zest
for
any
such
frolic
for
so
it
seemed
to
him
and
he
began
to
think
my
grandfather
horror
at
the
martyrdom
of
the
aged
saint
but
a
hypocrisy
nevertheless
he
was
wrought
upon
to
consent
and
they
sat
plotting
and
contriving
in
what
manner
they
should
act
their
several
parts
my
grandfather
pretending
great
fear
and
apprehension
at
the
thoughts
of
himself
a
stranger
going
alone
into
the
traps
of
a
house
where
there
were
sic
forerunners
of
shame
and
signs
of
danger
at
last
he
proposed
that
they
should
go
together
and
spy
about
the
precincts
of
the
place
and
try
to
discover
if
there
was
no
other
entrance
or
outgate
to
the
house
than
the
way
by
which
the
stripling
conducted
him
though
well
he
remembered
the
sallyport
where
the
fat
friar
kept
watch
eating
the
pasty
accordingly
they
went
forth
from
the
vintner
and
my
grandfather
as
if
he
knew
not
the
way
led
his
companion
round
between
the
priory
and
the
sea
till
they
came
near
the
aforesaid
sallyport
when
mounting
upon
a
stone
he
affected
to
discover
that
the
house
of
the
madam
stood
in
the
garden
within
and
that
the
sallyport
could
be
no
less
than
a
back
yett
thereto
while
they
were
speaking
concerning
the
same
my
grandfather
observed
the
wicket
open
in
the
gate
and
guessing
therefrom
that
it
was
one
spying
to
forewarn
somebody
within
who
wanted
to
come
out
unremarked
he
made
a
sign
to
his
companion
and
they
both
threw
themselves
flat
on
the
ground
and
hirsled
down
the
rocks
to
conceal
themselves
presently
the
gate
was
opened
and
then
out
came
the
fat
friar
and
looked
east
and
west
holding
the
door
in
his
hand
and
anon
out
came
his
grace
the
antichrist
hirpling
with
a
staff
in
his
hand
for
he
was
lame
with
that
monkish
malady
called
the
gout
the
friar
then
drew
the
yett
to
and
walked
on
towards
the
castle
with
his
grace
leaning
on
his
arm
in
the
meantime
the
poor
man
of
crail
was
grinding
the
teeth
of
his
rage
at
the
sight
of
the
cause
of
his
sorrow
and
my
grandfather
had
a
sore
struggle
to
keep
him
down
and
prevent
him
from
running
wud
and
furious
at
the
two
sacerdotal
reprobates
for
no
lightlier
could
they
be
called
thus
without
any
disclosure
on
my
grandfather
part
did
master
kilspinnie
come
to
jealouse
that
the
lemane
who
had
trysted
him
was
no
other
than
his
own
faithless
wife
and
he
smote
his
forehead
and
wept
bitterly
to
think
how
she
was
become
so
dreadless
in
sin
but
he
vowed
to
put
her
to
shame
so
it
was
covenanted
between
them
that
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
the
afflicted
husband
should
post
himself
near
to
where
they
then
stood
and
that
when
my
grandfather
was
admitted
by
the
other
entrance
to
the
house
he
should
devise
some
reason
for
walking
forth
into
the
garden
and
while
there
admit
master
kilspinnie
accordingly
betimes
my
grandfather
was
ready
and
the
stripling
as
had
been
bargained
came
for
him
to
the
vintner
and
conducted
him
to
the
house
where
after
giving
the
signals
before
enumerated
the
damsel
came
to
the
door
and
gave
him
admittance
leading
him
straight
to
the
inner
chamber
before
described
where
her
mistress
was
sitting
in
a
languishing
posture
with
the
table
spread
for
a
banquet
she
embraced
my
grandfather
with
many
fond
protestations
and
filled
him
a
cup
of
hot
malvesie
while
her
handmaid
brought
in
divers
savoury
dishes
but
he
though
a
valiant
young
man
was
not
at
his
ease
and
he
thought
of
the
poor
husband
and
the
five
babies
that
the
adultress
had
left
for
the
foul
love
of
the
papist
and
it
was
a
chaste
spell
and
a
restraining
grace
still
he
partook
a
little
of
the
rich
repast
which
had
been
prepared
and
feigned
so
long
a
false
pleasance
that
he
almost
became
pleased
in
reality
the
dame
however
was
herself
at
times
fearful
and
seemed
to
listen
if
there
was
any
knocking
at
the
door
telling
my
grandfather
that
his
grace
was
to
be
back
after
he
had
supped
at
the
castle
i
thought
said
she
to
have
had
you
here
when
he
was
at
the
burning
of
the
heretic
but
my
gilly
could
not
find
you
among
the
troopers
till
it
was
owre
late
for
when
he
brought
you
my
lord
had
come
to
solace
himself
after
the
execution
but
i
was
so
nettled
to
be
so
baulked
that
i
acted
myself
into
an
anger
till
i
got
him
away
not
however
without
a
threat
of
being
troubled
with
him
again
at
night
scarcely
had
madam
said
this
when
my
grandfather
started
up
and
feigned
to
be
in
great
terror
begging
her
to
let
him
hide
himself
in
the
garden
till
his
grace
was
come
and
gone
to
this
with
all
her
blandishments
the
guilty
woman
made
many
obstacles
but
he
was
fortified
of
the
lord
with
the
thoughts
of
her
injured
children
and
would
not
be
entreated
but
insisted
on
scogging
himself
in
the
garden
till
the
archbishop
was
sent
away
the
hour
of
his
coming
being
then
near
at
hand
seeing
him
thus
peremptory
madam
kilspinnie
was
obligated
to
conform
so
he
was
permitted
to
go
into
the
garden
and
no
sooner
was
he
there
than
he
went
to
the
sallyport
and
admitted
her
husband
and
well
it
was
that
he
had
been
so
steadfast
in
his
purpose
for
scarcely
were
they
moved
from
the
yett
into
a
honeysuckle
bower
hard
by
when
they
heard
it
again
open
and
in
came
his
grace
with
his
corpulent
pandarus
who
took
his
seat
on
the
bench
before
spoken
of
to
watch
while
his
master
went
into
the
house
the
good
bailie
of
crail
breathed
thickly
and
he
took
my
grandfather
by
the
hand
his
whole
frame
trembling
with
a
passion
of
grief
and
rage
in
the
lapse
of
some
four
or
five
minutes
the
giglet
damsel
came
out
of
the
house
and
by
the
glimpse
of
a
light
from
a
window
as
she
passed
they
saw
she
had
a
tankard
of
smoking
drink
in
her
hand
with
which
she
went
to
the
friar
and
my
grandfather
and
his
companion
taking
advantage
of
this
slipped
out
of
their
and
stole
softly
into
the
house
and
reached
the
outer
chamber
that
was
parted
from
madam
banquet
bower
by
the
arras
partition
there
they
stopped
to
listen
and
heard
her
complaining
in
a
most
dolorous
manner
of
great
ever
and
anon
begging
the
deluded
prelate
hamilton
to
taste
the
feast
she
had
prepared
for
him
in
the
hope
of
being
able
to
share
it
with
him
and
the
caresses
of
his
sweet
love
to
which
his
grace
as
often
replied
with
great
condolence
and
sympathy
how
very
grieved
he
was
to
find
her
in
that
sad
and
sore
estate
with
many
other
fond
cajoleries
most
odious
to
my
grandfather
to
hear
from
a
man
so
far
advanced
in
years
and
who
by
reason
of
the
reverence
of
his
office
ought
to
have
had
his
tongue
schooled
to
terms
of
piety
and
temperance
the
poor
husband
meanwhile
said
nothing
but
my
grandfather
heard
his
heart
panting
audibly
and
three
or
four
times
he
was
obligated
to
brush
away
his
hand
for
having
no
arms
himself
the
bailie
clutched
at
the
hilt
of
his
sword
and
would
have
drawn
it
from
the
scabbard
the
antichrist
seeing
his
lemane
in
such
great
malady
as
she
so
well
feigned
he
at
last
to
her
very
earnest
supplication
consented
to
leave
her
that
night
and
kissed
her
as
he
came
away
but
her
husband
broke
in
upon
them
with
the
rage
of
a
hungry
lion
and
seizing
his
grace
by
the
cuff
of
the
neck
swung
him
away
from
her
with
such
vehemence
that
he
fell
into
the
corner
of
the
room
like
a
sack
of
duds
as
for
madam
she
uttered
a
wild
cry
and
threw
herself
back
on
the
couch
where
she
was
sitting
and
seemed
as
if
she
had
swooned
having
no
other
device
so
ready
to
avoid
the
upbraidings
and
just
reproaches
of
her
spouse
but
she
was
soon
roused
from
that
fraudulent
dwam
by
my
grandfather
who
seizing
a
flagon
of
wine
dashed
it
upon
her
face
chapter
viii
mrs
kilspinnie
uttered
a
frightful
screech
and
starting
up
attempted
to
run
out
of
the
room
but
her
husband
caught
her
by
the
arm
and
my
grandfather
was
empowered
by
a
signal
grant
of
great
presence
of
mind
to
think
that
the
noise
might
cause
alarm
whereupon
he
sprang
instanter
to
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
just
as
the
damsel
was
coming
up
and
the
fat
friar
hobbling
as
fast
as
he
could
behind
her
and
he
had
but
time
to
say
to
her
as
it
was
with
an
inspiration
to
keep
all
quiet
in
the
garden
and
he
would
make
his
escape
by
the
other
door
she
on
hearing
this
ran
back
to
stop
the
pandarus
and
my
grandfather
closed
and
bolted
fast
that
back
door
going
forthwith
to
the
one
by
which
he
had
been
himself
admitted
and
which
having
opened
wide
to
the
wall
he
returned
to
the
scene
of
commotion
in
the
meantime
the
prelatic
dragon
that
was
so
ravished
from
the
woman
had
hastily
risen
upon
his
legs
and
red
with
a
dreadful
wrath
raged
as
if
he
would
have
devoured
her
husband
in
sooth
to
do
his
grace
justice
he
lacked
not
the
spirit
of
a
courageous
gentleman
and
he
could
not
my
grandfather
often
said
have
borne
himself
more
proudly
and
valiantly
had
he
been
a
belted
knight
bred
in
camps
and
fields
of
war
so
that
a
discreet
retreat
and
evasion
of
the
house
was
the
best
course
they
could
take
but
master
kilspinnie
fain
would
have
continued
his
biting
taunts
to
the
mistress
who
was
enacting
a
most
tragical
extravagance
of
affliction
and
terror
my
grandfather
however
suddenly
cut
him
short
crying
come
come
no
more
of
this
an
alarm
is
given
and
we
must
save
ourselves
with
that
he
seized
him
firmly
by
the
arm
and
in
a
manner
harled
him
out
of
the
house
and
into
the
lane
between
the
dykes
along
which
they
ran
with
nimble
heels
on
reaching
the
showgate
they
slackened
their
speed
still
however
walking
as
fast
as
they
could
till
they
came
near
the
port
when
they
again
drew
in
the
bridle
of
their
haste
going
through
among
the
guards
that
were
loitering
around
the
door
of
the
wardroom
and
passed
out
into
the
fields
as
if
they
had
been
indifferent
persons
on
escaping
the
gate
they
fell
in
with
divers
persons
going
along
the
road
who
by
their
discourse
were
returning
home
to
cupar
and
they
walked
leisurely
with
them
till
they
came
to
a
where
my
grandfather
giving
master
kilspinnie
a
nodge
turned
down
the
one
that
went
to
the
left
followed
by
him
and
it
happened
to
be
the
road
to
dysart
and
crail
this
will
do
said
master
kilspinnie
they
will
pursue
us
this
gait
upon
hearing
this
reasonable
apprehension
my
grandfather
stopped
and
conferred
with
himself
and
received
on
that
spot
a
blessed
experience
and
foretaste
of
the
protection
wherewith
to
a
great
age
he
was
all
his
days
protected
for
it
was
in
a
manner
revealed
to
him
that
he
should
throw
away
the
garbardine
and
sword
which
he
had
received
in
the
castle
and
thereby
appear
in
his
simple
craftsman
garb
and
that
they
should
turn
back
and
cross
the
cupar
road
and
go
along
the
other
which
led
to
the
dundee
waterside
ferry
this
he
told
to
his
fearful
companion
and
likewise
that
as
often
as
they
fell
in
with
or
heard
anybody
coming
up
the
bailie
should
hasten
on
before
or
den
himself
among
the
brechans
by
the
roadside
to
the
end
that
it
might
appear
they
were
not
two
persons
in
company
together
but
they
had
not
long
crossed
the
cupar
road
and
travelled
the
one
leading
to
the
ferry
when
they
heard
the
whirlwind
sound
of
horsemen
coming
after
them
at
which
the
honest
man
of
crail
darted
aside
and
lay
flat
on
his
grouff
ayont
a
bramble
bush
while
my
grandfather
began
to
lilt
as
blithely
as
he
could
the
bonny
lass
of
livingston
and
the
spring
was
ever
after
to
him
as
a
hymn
of
thanksgiving
but
the
words
he
then
sang
was
an
auld
ranting
godless
and
graceless
ditty
of
the
grooms
and
that
sorned
about
his
father
smiddy
and
the
closer
that
the
horsemen
came
he
was
strengthened
to
sing
the
louder
and
the
clearer
saw
ye
twa
fellows
ganging
this
gait
cried
the
foremost
of
the
pursuers
pulling
up
what
like
were
they
said
my
grandfather
in
a
simple
manner
ane
of
them
was
o
his
grace
guard
replied
the
man
but
the
other
curse
tak
me
gin
i
ken
what
he
was
like
but
he
the
bailie
or
provost
of
a
burrough
town
and
should
by
rights
hae
a
big
belly
to
this
my
grandfather
answered
briskly
nae
sic
twa
past
me
but
as
i
was
coming
along
whistling
thinking
o
naething
twa
sturdy
loons
ane
o
them
no
unlike
the
hempies
o
the
castle
ran
skirring
along
and
i
hae
a
thought
that
they
took
the
road
to
crail
or
dysart
that
was
my
thought
too
cried
the
horseman
as
he
turned
his
beast
and
the
rest
that
were
with
him
doing
the
same
bidding
my
grandfather
away
they
scampered
back
by
which
a
blessed
deliverance
was
there
wrought
to
him
and
his
companion
on
that
spot
in
that
night
as
soon
as
the
horsemen
had
gone
by
bailie
kilspinnie
came
from
his
and
both
he
and
my
grandfather
proved
that
no
was
on
their
feet
till
they
got
to
the
at
the
waterside
where
they
found
two
boats
taking
passengers
on
board
one
for
dundee
and
the
other
for
perth
here
my
grandfather
great
gift
of
foreknowledge
was
again
proven
for
he
proposed
that
they
should
bargain
with
the
skipper
of
the
dundee
boat
to
take
them
to
that
town
and
pay
him
like
the
other
passengers
at
once
in
an
open
manner
but
that
as
the
night
was
cloudy
and
dark
they
should
go
cannily
aboard
the
boat
for
perth
as
it
were
in
mistake
and
feign
not
to
discover
their
error
till
they
were
far
up
the
river
when
they
should
proceed
to
the
town
letting
wot
that
by
the
return
of
the
tide
they
would
go
in
the
morning
by
the
perth
boat
to
dundee
with
which
master
kilspinnie
was
well
acquainted
he
having
had
many
times
in
the
way
of
his
traffic
as
a
plaiding
merchant
cause
to
use
the
same
and
thereby
knew
it
went
twice
a
week
and
that
the
morrow
was
one
of
the
days
all
this
they
were
enabled
to
do
with
such
fortitude
and
decorum
that
no
one
aboard
the
perth
boat
could
have
divined
that
they
were
not
honest
men
in
great
trouble
of
mind
at
discovering
they
had
come
into
the
wrong
boat
but
nothing
showed
more
that
providence
had
a
hand
in
all
this
than
what
ensued
for
all
the
passengers
in
the
boat
had
been
at
st
andrews
to
hear
the
trial
and
see
the
martyrdom
and
they
were
sharp
and
vehement
not
only
in
their
condemnation
of
the
mitred
antichrist
but
grieved
with
a
sincere
sorrow
that
none
of
the
nobles
of
scotland
would
stand
forth
in
their
ancient
bravery
to
resist
and
overthrow
a
race
of
oppressors
more
grievous
than
the
southrons
that
trode
on
the
neck
of
their
fathers
in
the
times
of
the
wallace
wight
and
king
robert
the
bruce
truly
there
was
a
spirit
of
unison
and
indignation
in
the
company
on
board
that
boat
everyone
thirsting
with
a
holy
ardour
to
avenge
the
cruelties
of
which
the
papistical
priesthood
were
daily
growing
more
and
more
crouse
in
the
perpetration
and
they
made
the
shores
ring
with
the
olden
song
of
o
for
my
ain
king
quo
gude
wallace
the
rightfu
king
of
fair
scotlan
between
me
and
my
sovereign
dear
i
think
i
see
some
ill
seed
sawn
it
was
the
grey
of
the
morning
before
they
reached
perth
and
as
soon
as
they
were
put
on
the
land
the
bailie
took
my
grandfather
with
him
to
the
house
of
one
sawners
ruthven
a
with
whom
he
had
dealings
a
staid
and
discreet
man
who
when
he
had
supplied
them
with
breakfast
exhorted
them
not
to
tarry
in
the
town
then
a
place
that
had
fallen
under
the
suspicion
of
the
clergy
the
lordly
monks
of
scoone
taking
great
power
and
authority
in
despite
of
the
magistrates
against
all
that
fell
under
their
evil
thoughts
anent
heresy
and
he
counselled
them
not
to
proceed
as
my
grandfather
had
proposed
straight
on
to
edinburgh
by
the
queensferry
but
to
hasten
up
the
country
to
crieff
and
thence
take
the
road
to
stirling
in
this
there
was
much
prudence
but
bailie
kilspinnie
was
in
sore
tribulation
on
account
of
his
children
whom
he
had
left
at
his
home
in
crail
fearing
that
the
talons
of
antichrist
would
lay
hold
of
them
and
keep
them
as
hostages
till
he
was
given
up
to
suffer
for
what
he
had
done
none
doubting
that
baal
for
so
he
nicknamed
the
prelatic
hamilton
would
impute
to
him
the
unpardonable
sin
of
heresy
and
schism
and
leave
no
stone
unturned
to
bring
him
to
the
stake
but
sawners
ruthven
comforted
him
with
the
assurance
that
his
grace
would
not
venture
to
act
in
that
manner
for
it
was
known
how
mistress
kilspinnie
then
lived
at
st
andrews
as
his
concubine
nevertheless
the
poor
man
was
in
sore
affliction
and
as
he
and
my
grandfather
travelled
towards
crieff
many
a
bitter
prayer
did
his
vexed
spirit
pour
forth
in
its
grief
that
the
right
arm
of
the
lord
might
soon
be
manifested
against
the
roman
locust
that
consumed
the
land
and
made
its
corruption
naught
in
the
nostrils
of
heaven
thus
was
it
manifest
that
there
was
much
of
the
ire
of
a
selfish
revenge
mixt
up
with
the
rage
which
was
at
that
time
kindled
in
so
unquenchable
a
manner
against
the
beast
and
its
worshippers
for
in
the
history
of
the
honest
man
of
crail
there
was
a
great
similitude
to
other
foul
and
worse
things
which
the
roman
idolaters
seemed
to
regard
among
their
pestiferous
immunities
and
counted
themselves
free
to
do
without
dread
of
any
earthly
retribution
chapter
ix
my
grandfather
and
his
companion
hastened
on
in
their
journey
but
instead
of
going
to
stirling
they
crossed
the
river
at
alloa
and
so
passed
by
the
way
to
edinburgh
where
on
entering
the
they
separated
the
bailie
who
was
a
fearful
man
and
in
constant
dread
and
terror
of
being
burned
as
a
heretic
for
having
broke
in
upon
the
dalliance
of
his
incontinent
wife
and
the
primate
of
st
andrews
went
to
a
cousin
of
his
own
a
dealer
in
serge
and
temming
in
the
lawnmarket
with
whom
he
concealed
himself
for
some
weeks
but
my
grandfather
proceeded
straight
towards
the
lodging
of
the
earl
of
glencairn
to
recount
to
his
lordship
the
whole
passages
of
what
he
had
been
concerned
in
from
the
night
that
he
departed
from
his
presence
it
was
by
this
time
the
mirkest
of
the
gloaming
for
they
had
purposely
tarried
on
their
journey
that
they
might
enter
edinburgh
at
dusk
the
shops
of
the
traders
were
shut
for
in
those
days
there
was
such
a
resort
of
sorners
and
lawless
men
among
the
trains
of
the
nobles
and
gentry
that
it
was
not
safe
for
honest
merchants
to
keep
their
shops
open
after
nightfall
nevertheless
the
streets
were
not
darkened
for
there
were
then
many
with
images
of
the
saints
and
cruisies
burning
afore
them
in
divers
parts
of
the
high
street
and
corners
of
the
wynds
insomuch
that
it
was
easy
as
i
have
heard
my
grandfather
tell
to
see
and
know
anyone
passing
in
the
light
thereof
and
indeed
what
befel
himself
was
proof
of
it
for
as
he
was
coming
through
st
giles
kirkyard
which
is
now
the
parliament
close
and
through
which
at
that
time
there
was
a
style
and
path
for
passengers
a
young
man
whom
he
had
observed
following
him
came
close
up
just
as
he
reached
a
begging
image
of
the
virgin
mary
with
its
lamp
that
stood
on
a
pillar
at
the
corner
of
the
cathedral
and
touching
him
on
the
left
shoulder
at
that
spot
made
him
look
round
in
such
a
manner
that
the
light
of
the
virgin
lamp
fell
full
on
his
face
dinna
be
frighted
said
the
stranger
i
ken
you
and
i
in
lord
glencairn
service
but
follow
me
and
say
nothing
my
grandfather
was
not
a
little
startled
by
this
salutation
he
however
made
no
observe
but
replied
go
on
then
so
the
stranger
went
forward
and
after
various
turnings
and
windings
led
him
down
into
the
cowgate
and
up
a
close
on
the
south
side
thereof
and
then
to
a
dark
timber
stair
that
was
so
frail
and
creaking
and
narrow
that
his
guide
bade
him
haul
himself
up
with
the
help
of
a
rope
that
hung
down
dangling
for
that
purpose
when
they
had
raised
themselves
to
the
stairhead
the
stranger
opened
a
door
and
they
went
together
into
a
small
and
lonesome
chamber
in
the
of
which
an
old
iron
cruisie
was
burning
with
a
winking
and
wizard
light
i
hae
brought
you
here
said
his
conductor
for
secrecy
for
my
lord
disna
want
that
ye
should
be
seen
about
his
lodging
i
ane
of
three
that
hae
been
lang
seeking
you
and
as
a
token
that
ye
no
deceived
i
was
bade
to
tell
you
that
before
parting
from
my
lord
he
you
two
pieces
of
gold
out
of
his
coffer
in
the
chamber
where
he
supped
my
grandfather
thought
this
very
like
a
proof
that
he
had
been
so
informed
by
the
earl
himself
but
happening
to
remark
that
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
light
and
kept
his
face
hidden
in
the
shadow
of
the
darkness
providence
put
it
into
his
head
to
jealouse
that
he
might
nevertheless
be
a
spy
one
perhaps
that
had
been
trusted
in
like
manner
as
he
had
himself
been
trusted
and
who
had
afterwards
sold
himself
to
the
perdition
of
the
adversaries
cause
he
was
accordingly
on
his
guard
but
replied
with
seeming
frankness
that
it
was
very
true
he
had
received
two
pieces
of
gold
from
the
earl
at
his
departure
then
said
the
young
man
by
that
token
ye
may
know
that
i
am
in
the
private
service
of
the
earl
who
for
reasons
best
known
to
himsel
hath
willed
that
you
should
tell
me
that
i
may
report
the
same
secretly
to
him
what
espionage
you
have
made
my
grandfather
was
perplexed
by
this
speech
but
distrust
having
crept
into
his
thoughts
instead
of
replying
with
a
full
recital
of
all
his
adventures
he
briefly
said
that
he
had
indeed
effected
nothing
for
his
soul
was
sickened
by
the
woful
martyrdom
of
the
godly
master
mill
to
so
great
a
disease
that
he
could
not
endure
to
abide
in
st
andrews
and
therefore
he
had
come
back
but
you
have
been
long
on
the
way
how
is
that
it
is
now
many
days
since
the
burning
replied
the
stranger
you
say
truly
was
my
grandfather
answer
for
i
came
round
by
perth
but
i
tarried
at
no
place
longer
than
was
needful
to
repair
and
refresh
nature
perth
was
a
wide
bout
gait
to
take
frae
st
andrews
to
come
to
edinburgh
i
marvel
how
ye
went
so
far
astray
said
the
young
man
curiously
in
sooth
it
was
but
being
sorely
demented
with
the
tragical
end
of
the
godly
old
man
replied
my
grandfather
and
seeing
that
i
could
do
the
earl
no
manner
of
service
i
wist
not
well
what
course
to
take
so
after
meickle
tribulation
of
thought
and
great
uncertainty
of
purpose
i
resolved
to
come
hither
little
more
passed
the
young
man
rose
and
said
to
my
grandfather
he
feared
the
earl
would
be
so
little
content
with
him
that
he
had
better
not
go
near
him
but
seek
some
other
master
and
when
they
had
descended
the
stair
and
were
come
into
the
street
he
advised
him
to
go
to
the
house
of
a
certain
widow
rippet
that
let
dry
lodgings
in
the
and
roost
there
for
that
night
the
which
my
grandfather
in
a
manner
signified
he
would
do
and
so
they
parted
the
stranger
at
first
walked
soberly
away
but
he
had
not
gone
many
paces
when
he
suddenly
turned
into
a
close
leading
up
to
the
and
my
grandfather
heard
the
pattering
of
his
feet
running
as
swiftly
as
possible
which
confirmed
to
him
what
he
suspected
and
so
instead
of
going
towards
the
widow
rippet
house
he
turned
back
and
went
straight
on
to
st
mary
wynd
where
the
earl
lodging
was
and
knocking
at
the
yett
was
speedily
admitted
and
conducted
instanter
to
my
lord
presence
whom
he
found
alone
reading
many
papers
which
lay
on
a
table
before
him
gilhaize
said
the
earl
how
is
this
why
have
you
come
back
and
wherefore
is
it
that
i
have
heard
no
tidings
from
you
whereupon
my
grandfather
recounted
to
him
all
the
circumstantials
which
i
have
rehearsed
from
the
hour
of
his
departure
from
edinburgh
up
till
the
very
time
when
he
then
stood
in
his
master
presence
the
earl
made
no
inroad
on
his
narrative
while
he
was
telling
it
but
his
countenance
often
changed
and
he
was
much
moved
at
different
passages
sometimes
with
sorrow
and
sometimes
with
anger
and
he
laughed
vehemently
at
the
mishap
which
had
befallen
the
grand
adversary
of
the
congregation
and
his
concubine
the
adventure
however
with
the
unknown
varlet
in
the
street
appeared
to
make
his
lordship
very
thoughtful
and
no
less
than
thrice
did
he
question
my
grandfather
if
he
had
indeed
given
but
those
barren
answers
which
i
have
already
recited
to
all
which
he
received
the
most
solemn
asseverations
that
no
more
was
said
his
lordship
then
sat
some
time
cogitating
with
his
hands
resting
on
his
thighs
his
brows
bent
and
his
lips
pursed
as
with
sharp
thought
at
last
he
said
gilhaize
you
have
done
better
in
this
than
i
ought
to
have
expected
of
one
so
young
and
unpractised
the
favour
you
won
with
sir
david
hamilton
was
no
more
than
i
thought
your
looks
and
manners
would
beget
but
you
are
not
only
but
and
had
you
not
found
yourself
worthily
bound
to
your
duty
i
doubt
not
you
might
have
prospered
in
the
archbishop
household
the
affair
with
madam
kilspinnie
was
a
thing
i
reckoned
not
of
yet
therein
you
have
proved
yourself
not
only
a
very
joseph
but
so
ripe
in
wit
beyond
your
years
that
your
merits
deserve
more
commendation
than
i
can
afford
to
give
for
i
have
not
sufficient
to
bestow
on
the
singular
prudence
and
discernment
wherewith
you
have
parried
the
treacherous
thrusts
of
that
judas
iscariot
winterton
for
so
i
doubt
not
is
the
traitor
who
waylaid
you
he
was
once
in
my
service
and
is
now
in
the
queen
regent
in
sending
off
my
men
on
errands
similar
to
yours
i
was
wont
to
give
them
two
pieces
of
gold
and
this
the
false
loon
has
gathered
to
be
a
custom
from
others
as
well
as
by
his
own
knowledge
and
he
has
made
it
the
key
to
open
the
breasts
of
my
servants
to
know
this
however
is
a
great
discovery
but
gilhaize
not
to
waste
words
you
have
your
confidence
go
therefore
i
pray
you
with
all
speed
to
the
widow
rippet
and
do
as
winterton
bade
you
and
as
chance
may
require
in
the
morning
come
again
hither
for
i
have
this
night
many
weighty
affairs
and
you
have
shown
yourself
possessed
of
a
discerning
spirit
that
may
in
these
times
of
peril
and
perjury
help
the
great
cause
of
all
good
scotchmen
in
saying
these
most
acceptable
words
he
clapped
my
grandfather
on
the
shoulder
and
encouraged
him
to
be
as
as
he
was
and
he
could
not
fail
to
earn
both
treasure
and
trusts
so
my
left
him
and
went
to
the
widow
rippet
in
the
and
around
her
kitchen
fire
he
found
some
four
or
five
discarded
knaves
that
were
bargaining
with
her
for
beds
or
for
leave
to
sleep
by
the
hearth
and
he
had
not
been
long
seated
among
them
when
his
heart
was
grieved
with
pain
to
see
winterton
come
in
and
behind
him
the
two
simple
lads
of
lithgow
that
had
left
their
homes
with
him
whom
it
appeared
the
varlet
had
seduced
from
the
earl
of
glencairn
service
and
inveigled
into
the
earl
of
seaton
a
rampant
papist
by
the
same
wiles
wherewith
he
thought
he
had
likewise
made
a
conquest
of
my
grandfather
whom
they
had
all
come
together
to
see
for
the
two
lithgow
lads
like
reynard
the
fox
when
he
had
lost
his
tail
were
eager
that
he
too
should
make
himself
like
them
he
feigned
however
great
weariness
and
indeed
his
heart
was
heavy
to
see
such
skill
of
wickedness
in
so
young
a
man
as
he
saw
in
winterton
so
after
partaking
with
them
of
some
spiced
ale
which
winterton
brought
from
the
salutation
tavern
opposite
the
he
declared
himself
overcome
with
sleep
and
perforce
thereof
obligated
to
go
to
bed
but
when
they
were
gone
and
he
had
retired
to
his
sorry
couch
no
sleep
came
to
his
eyelids
but
only
hot
and
salt
tears
for
he
thought
that
he
had
been
in
a
measure
concerned
in
bringing
away
the
two
thoughtless
lads
from
their
homes
and
he
saw
that
they
were
not
tempered
to
resist
the
temptations
of
the
world
but
would
soon
fall
away
from
their
religious
integrity
and
become
lewd
and
godless
roisters
like
the
wuddy
worthies
that
paid
for
leave
to
sleep
on
the
widow
hearth
chapter
x
at
the
first
blink
of
the
grey
eye
of
the
morning
my
grandfather
rose
and
quitting
the
house
of
the
widow
rippet
went
straight
to
the
lodgings
and
was
admitted
the
porter
at
the
door
told
him
that
their
master
having
been
up
all
night
had
but
just
retired
to
bed
but
while
they
were
speaking
the
earl
page
who
slept
in
the
called
from
the
stairhead
to
inquire
who
it
was
that
had
come
so
early
and
being
informed
thereof
he
went
into
his
master
and
afterwards
came
again
and
desired
my
grandfather
to
walk
up
and
conducted
him
to
his
lordship
whom
he
found
on
his
couch
but
not
undressed
and
who
said
to
him
on
his
entering
when
the
page
had
retired
i
am
glad
gilhaize
that
you
have
come
thus
early
for
i
want
a
trusty
man
to
go
forthwith
into
the
west
country
what
i
wish
you
to
do
can
not
be
written
but
you
will
take
this
ring
and
he
took
one
from
the
little
finger
of
his
right
hand
on
the
gem
of
which
his
cipher
was
graven
and
gave
it
to
my
grandfather
on
showing
it
to
lord
boyd
whom
you
will
find
at
the
dean
castle
near
kilmarnock
he
will
thereby
know
that
you
are
specially
trusted
of
me
the
message
whereof
you
are
the
bearer
is
to
this
effect
that
the
lords
of
the
congregation
have
by
their
friends
in
many
places
received
strong
exhortations
to
step
forward
and
oppose
the
headlong
fury
of
the
churchmen
and
that
they
have
in
consequence
deemed
it
necessary
to
lose
no
time
in
ascertaining
what
the
strength
of
the
reformed
may
be
and
to
procure
declarations
for
mutual
defence
from
all
who
are
joined
in
professing
the
true
religion
of
christ
should
he
see
meet
to
employ
you
in
this
matter
you
will
obey
his
orders
and
instructions
whatsoever
they
may
be
the
earl
then
put
his
hand
aneath
his
pillow
and
drew
out
a
small
leathern
purse
which
he
gave
to
my
grandfather
who
in
the
doing
of
this
observed
that
he
had
several
other
similar
purses
ready
under
his
head
in
taking
it
my
grandfather
was
proceeding
to
tell
him
what
he
had
observed
at
the
widow
rippet
but
his
lordship
interrupted
him
saying
such
things
are
of
no
issue
now
and
your
present
duty
is
in
a
higher
road
therefore
make
haste
and
god
be
with
you
with
these
words
his
lordship
turned
himself
on
his
couch
and
composed
himself
to
sleep
which
my
grandfather
after
looking
on
for
about
a
minute
or
so
observing
came
away
and
having
borrowed
a
frock
and
a
for
the
journey
from
one
of
the
grooms
of
the
hall
he
went
straight
to
kenneth
shelty
a
noted
in
those
days
who
lived
at
the
and
bargained
with
him
for
the
hire
of
a
beast
to
glasgow
though
glasgow
was
not
then
the
nearest
road
to
kilmarnock
but
he
thought
it
prudent
to
go
that
way
in
case
any
of
the
papistical
emissaries
should
track
his
course
there
was
however
a
little
oversight
in
this
which
did
not
come
to
mind
till
he
was
some
miles
on
the
road
and
that
was
the
obligation
it
put
him
under
of
passing
through
lithgow
where
he
was
so
well
known
and
where
all
his
kith
and
kin
lived
there
being
then
no
immediate
route
from
edinburgh
to
glasgow
but
by
lithgow
and
he
debated
with
himself
for
a
space
of
time
whether
he
ought
to
proceed
or
turn
back
and
go
the
other
way
and
his
mind
was
sorely
troubled
with
doubts
and
difficulties
at
last
he
considered
that
it
was
never
deemed
wise
or
fortunate
to
turn
back
in
any
undertaking
and
besides
having
for
the
service
of
the
saviour
left
his
father
house
and
renounced
his
parents
like
a
bird
that
taketh
wing
and
knoweth
the
nest
where
it
was
bred
no
more
he
knit
up
his
ravelled
thoughts
into
resolution
and
clapping
spurs
to
his
horse
rode
bravely
on
but
when
he
beheld
the
towers
of
the
palace
and
the
steeples
of
his
native
town
rising
before
him
many
remembrances
came
rushing
to
his
heart
and
all
the
vexations
he
had
suffered
there
were
lost
in
the
sunny
recollections
of
the
morning
of
life
when
everyone
was
kind
and
the
eyes
of
his
parents
looked
on
him
with
the
brightness
of
delight
in
so
much
that
his
soul
yearned
within
him
and
his
cheeks
were
wetted
with
tears
nevertheless
he
overcame
this
thaw
of
his
fortitude
and
went
forward
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
determined
to
swerve
not
in
his
duty
to
the
earl
of
glencairn
nor
in
his
holier
fealty
to
a
far
greater
master
but
the
softness
that
he
felt
in
his
nature
made
him
gird
himself
with
a
firm
purpose
to
ride
through
the
town
without
stopping
scarcely
however
had
he
entered
the
port
when
his
horse
stumbled
and
lost
a
shoe
by
which
he
was
not
only
constrained
to
stop
but
to
take
him
to
his
father
smiddy
which
was
in
sight
when
the
mischance
happened
on
going
to
the
door
he
found
as
was
commonly
the
case
a
number
of
grooms
and
flunkies
of
the
courtiers
with
certain
friars
holding
vehement
discourse
concerning
the
tidings
of
the
time
the
burden
of
which
was
the
burning
of
the
aged
master
mill
a
thing
that
even
the
monks
durst
not
for
humanity
venture
very
strenuously
to
defend
his
father
was
not
then
within
but
one
of
the
prentice
lads
seeing
who
it
was
that
had
come
with
a
horse
to
be
shod
ran
to
tell
him
and
at
the
sight
of
my
grandfather
the
friars
suspended
their
controversies
with
the
and
gathered
round
him
with
many
questions
he
replied
however
to
them
all
with
few
words
bidding
the
foreman
to
make
haste
and
shoe
his
horse
hoping
that
he
might
thereby
be
off
and
away
before
his
father
came
but
while
the
man
was
throng
with
the
horse
foot
both
father
and
mother
came
rushing
in
and
his
mother
was
weeping
bitterly
and
wringing
her
hands
chiding
him
as
if
he
had
sold
himself
to
the
evil
one
and
beseeching
him
to
stop
and
repent
his
father
however
said
little
but
inquired
how
he
had
been
what
he
was
doing
and
where
he
was
going
and
sent
the
prentice
lad
to
bring
a
stoup
of
spiced
ale
from
a
public
hard
by
in
which
he
pledged
him
kindly
hoping
he
would
do
well
for
himself
and
he
would
do
well
for
his
parents
the
which
fatherliness
touched
my
grandfather
more
to
the
quick
than
all
the
loud
lament
and
reproaches
of
his
mother
and
he
replied
that
he
had
entered
into
the
service
of
a
nobleman
and
was
then
riding
on
his
business
to
glasgow
but
he
mentioned
no
name
nor
did
his
father
inquire
his
mother
however
burst
out
into
clamorous
revilings
declaring
her
dread
that
it
was
some
of
the
apostate
heretics
and
giving
vent
to
her
passion
was
as
one
in
a
frenzy
or
possessed
of
a
devil
the
very
friars
were
confounded
at
her
distraction
and
tried
to
soothe
her
and
remove
her
forth
the
smiddy
which
only
made
her
more
wild
so
that
all
present
compassionated
my
grandfather
who
sat
silent
and
made
no
answer
wearying
till
his
horse
was
ready
but
greatly
afflicted
as
he
was
by
this
trial
it
was
nothing
to
what
ensued
when
after
having
mounted
and
shaken
his
father
by
the
hand
he
galloped
away
to
the
there
on
the
outside
he
was
met
by
two
women
and
an
old
man
parents
of
the
lads
whom
he
had
taken
with
him
to
edinburgh
having
heard
he
was
at
his
father
smiddy
instead
of
going
thither
they
had
come
to
that
place
in
order
that
they
might
speak
with
him
more
apart
and
free
from
molestation
concerning
their
sons
one
of
the
women
was
a
poor
widow
and
she
had
no
other
child
nor
the
hope
of
any
other
for
her
old
age
she
however
said
nothing
but
stood
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
at
her
eyes
sobbing
very
afflictedly
while
her
friends
on
seeing
my
grandfather
coming
out
of
the
port
stepped
forward
and
the
old
man
caught
the
horse
by
the
bridle
and
said
gravely
ye
maun
stop
and
satisfy
three
sorrowful
parents
what
hae
ye
done
with
your
twa
thoughtless
companions
my
grandfather
heart
was
as
if
it
would
have
perished
in
his
bosom
for
the
company
he
had
seen
the
lads
with
and
the
talk
they
had
held
and
above
all
their
recklessness
of
principle
came
upon
him
like
a
withering
flash
of
fire
he
however
replied
soberly
that
he
had
seen
them
both
the
night
before
and
that
they
were
well
in
health
and
jocund
in
spirit
the
mother
that
was
standing
near
her
husband
was
blithe
to
hear
this
and
reminded
her
gudeman
how
she
had
often
said
that
when
they
did
hear
tidings
of
their
son
her
words
would
be
found
true
for
he
had
ever
been
all
his
days
a
brisk
and
a
valiant
bairn
but
the
helpless
widow
was
not
content
and
she
came
forward
drying
her
tears
saying
and
what
is
my
poor
fatherless
about
fearfu
fearfu
to
be
particular
for
though
he
was
aye
to
me
he
was
easily
wised
and
i
doubt
i
doubt
he
prove
a
blasting
or
a
blessing
according
to
the
hands
he
fa
among
i
hope
and
pray
said
my
grandfather
that
he
be
protected
from
scaith
and
live
to
be
a
comfort
to
all
his
friends
and
so
saying
he
disengaged
his
bridle
with
a
gentle
violence
from
the
old
man
hold
telling
them
he
could
not
afford
to
stop
being
timed
to
reach
glasgow
that
night
so
he
pricked
the
horse
with
his
rowals
and
shot
away
but
his
heart
all
the
remainder
of
his
day
journey
was
as
if
it
had
been
pierced
with
many
barbed
arrows
and
the
sad
voice
of
the
poor
anxious
widow
rung
in
his
ears
like
the
sound
of
some
doleful
knell
saving
this
affair
at
lithgow
nothing
befell
him
till
he
came
to
the
gates
of
glasgow
by
which
time
it
was
dark
and
the
ward
and
watch
set
and
they
questioned
him
very
sharply
before
giving
him
admission
for
the
queen
regent
was
then
sojourning
in
the
castle
and
her
fears
and
cares
were
greatly
quickened
at
that
time
by
rumours
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
concerning
the
murder
as
it
was
called
of
master
mill
on
this
account
the
french
guards
which
she
had
with
her
were
instructed
to
be
jealous
of
all
untimeous
travellers
and
they
being
joined
with
a
ward
of
burghers
but
using
only
their
own
tongue
caused
no
small
molestation
to
every
scotsman
that
sought
admission
after
the
sun
was
set
for
the
burghers
not
being
well
versed
in
military
practices
were
of
themselves
very
propugnacious
in
their
authority
making
more
ado
than
even
the
frenchmen
it
happened
however
that
there
was
among
those
valiant
traders
and
craftsmen
of
glasgow
one
thomas
sword
the
deacon
of
the
hammermen
and
he
having
the
command
of
those
stationed
at
the
gate
overheard
what
was
passing
with
my
grandfather
and
coming
out
of
the
wardroom
inquired
his
name
which
when
he
heard
and
that
he
was
son
to
michael
gilhaize
the
lithgow
ferrier
he
advised
to
let
him
in
saying
he
knew
his
father
well
and
that
they
had
worked
together
when
young
men
in
the
king
armoury
at
stirling
and
he
told
him
where
he
lived
and
invited
him
when
his
horse
was
stabled
to
come
to
supper
for
he
was
glad
to
see
him
for
his
father
sake
chapter
xi
at
this
time
an
ancient
controversy
between
the
archbishops
of
st
andrews
and
of
glasgow
touching
their
respective
jurisdictions
had
been
resuscitated
with
great
acrimony
and
in
the
debates
concerning
the
same
the
glasgow
people
took
a
deep
interest
for
they
are
stouthearted
and
of
an
adventurous
spirit
and
can
not
abide
to
think
that
they
or
their
town
should
in
anything
of
public
honour
be
deemed
either
slack
or
second
to
the
foremost
in
the
realm
and
none
of
all
the
worthy
burgesses
thereof
thought
more
proudly
of
the
superiority
and
renown
of
their
city
than
did
deacon
sword
so
it
came
to
pass
as
he
was
sitting
at
supper
with
my
grandfather
that
he
enlarged
and
expatiated
on
the
inordinate
pretensions
of
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
and
took
occasion
to
diverge
from
the
prelate
political
ambition
to
speak
of
the
enormities
of
his
ecclesiastical
government
and
particularly
of
that
heinous
and
act
the
burning
of
an
aged
man
of
fourscore
and
two
years
whose
very
heresies
as
the
deacon
mercifully
said
ought
rather
to
have
been
imputed
to
dotage
than
charged
as
offences
my
grandfather
was
well
pleased
to
observe
such
vigour
of
principle
and
bravery
of
character
in
one
having
such
sway
and
weight
in
so
great
a
community
as
to
be
the
chief
captain
of
the
crafts
who
were
banded
with
the
hammermen
namely
the
cartwrights
the
saddlers
the
masons
the
coopers
the
mariners
and
all
whose
work
required
the
use
of
the
hardiest
and
buirdliest
of
the
trades
and
he
allowed
himself
to
run
in
with
the
deacon
humour
but
without
letting
wot
either
in
whose
service
he
was
or
on
what
exploit
he
was
bound
sowing
however
from
time
to
time
hints
as
to
the
need
that
seemed
to
be
growing
of
putting
a
curb
on
the
bold
front
wherewith
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
under
the
pretext
of
suppressing
heresies
butted
with
the
horns
of
oppression
against
all
who
stood
within
the
reverence
of
his
displeasure
deacon
sword
had
himself
a
leaning
to
the
reformed
doctrines
which
with
his
public
enmity
to
the
challenger
of
his
own
archbishop
made
him
take
to
those
hints
with
so
great
an
affinity
that
he
vowed
to
god
shaking
my
grandfather
by
the
hand
over
the
table
that
if
some
steps
were
not
soon
taken
to
stop
such
inordinate
misrule
there
were
not
wanting
five
hundred
men
in
glasgow
who
would
start
forward
with
weapons
in
their
grip
at
the
first
tout
of
a
trump
to
vindicate
the
liberties
of
the
subject
and
the
wholesome
administration
by
the
temporal
judges
of
the
law
against
all
offenders
as
of
old
and
giving
scope
to
his
ardour
he
said
there
was
then
such
a
spirit
awakened
in
glasgow
that
men
women
and
children
thirsted
to
see
justice
executed
on
the
churchmen
who
were
daily
waxing
more
and
more
wroth
and
insatiable
against
everyone
who
called
their
doctrines
or
polity
in
question
thus
out
of
the
very
devices
which
had
been
devised
by
those
about
the
queen
regent
to
intercept
the
free
communion
of
the
people
with
one
another
was
the
means
brought
about
whereby
a
chosen
emissary
of
the
congregation
came
to
get
at
the
emboldening
knowledge
of
the
sense
of
the
citizens
of
glasgow
with
regard
to
the
great
cause
which
at
that
period
troubled
the
minds
and
fears
of
all
men
my
grandfather
was
joyfully
heartened
by
what
he
heard
and
before
coming
away
from
the
deacon
who
with
the
hospitality
common
to
his
townsmen
would
fain
have
had
him
to
prolong
their
sederunt
over
the
gardevine
he
said
that
if
glasgow
were
as
true
and
valiant
as
it
was
thought
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
her
declaration
for
the
lords
of
the
congregation
would
work
out
a
great
redress
of
public
wrongs
for
from
all
he
could
learn
and
understand
those
high
and
pious
noblemen
had
nothing
more
at
heart
than
to
procure
for
the
people
the
free
exercise
of
their
right
to
worship
god
according
to
their
conscience
and
the
doctrines
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
but
though
over
the
the
deacon
had
spoken
so
dreadless
and
like
a
manly
citizen
my
grandfather
resolved
with
himself
to
depart
betimes
for
kilmarnock
in
case
of
any
change
in
his
temper
accordingly
he
requested
the
hostler
of
the
hostel
where
he
had
taken
his
bed
to
which
his
day
hard
journey
early
inclined
him
to
have
his
horse
in
readiness
before
break
of
day
but
this
hostel
which
was
called
the
cross
of
rhodes
happened
to
be
situated
at
the
and
besides
being
a
tavern
and
inn
was
likewise
the
great
ferryhouse
of
the
clyde
when
the
tide
was
up
or
the
ford
rendered
unsafe
by
the
torrents
of
the
speats
and
inland
rains
the
which
caused
it
to
be
much
frequented
by
the
skippers
and
mariners
of
the
barks
that
traded
to
france
and
genoa
with
the
renfrew
salmon
and
by
all
sorts
of
travellers
at
all
times
even
to
the
small
hours
of
the
morning
in
short
it
was
a
boisterous
house
the
company
resorting
thereto
of
a
sort
little
in
unison
with
the
religious
frame
of
my
grandfather
as
soon
therefore
as
he
came
from
the
deacon
he
went
to
bed
without
taking
off
his
clothes
in
order
that
he
might
be
fit
for
the
road
as
he
intended
and
his
bed
being
in
the
public
room
with
sliding
doors
he
drew
them
upon
him
hoping
to
shut
out
some
of
the
din
and
to
win
a
little
repose
but
scarcely
had
he
laid
his
head
on
the
pillow
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
one
entering
the
room
and
listening
eagerly
he
discovered
that
it
was
no
other
than
the
traitor
winterton
the
which
so
amazed
him
with
apprehension
that
he
shook
as
he
lay
like
the
aspen
leaf
on
the
tree
winterton
called
like
a
braggart
for
supper
and
hot
wine
boasting
he
had
ridden
that
day
from
edinburgh
and
that
he
must
be
up
and
across
his
horse
by
daylight
in
the
morning
as
he
had
need
to
be
in
kilmarnock
by
noon
in
this
which
vanity
made
him
tell
in
bravado
my
grandfather
could
not
but
discern
a
kind
providence
admonishing
himself
for
he
had
no
doubt
that
winterton
was
in
pursuit
of
him
and
thankful
he
was
that
he
had
given
no
inkling
to
anyone
in
the
house
as
to
whence
he
had
come
and
where
he
was
going
but
had
this
thought
not
at
once
entered
his
head
he
would
soon
have
had
cause
to
think
it
for
while
winterton
was
eating
his
supper
he
began
to
converse
with
their
host
and
to
inquire
what
travellers
had
crossed
the
river
twice
or
thrice
in
as
it
were
an
manner
he
spoke
of
one
whom
he
called
a
cousin
but
in
describing
his
garb
he
left
no
doubt
in
my
grandfather
bosom
that
it
was
regarding
him
he
seemed
at
once
both
so
negligent
and
so
anxious
most
providential
therefore
it
was
that
my
grandfather
had
altered
his
dress
before
leaving
edinburgh
for
the
marks
which
winterton
gave
of
him
were
chiefly
drawn
from
his
ordinary
garb
and
by
them
their
host
in
consequence
said
he
had
seen
no
such
person
when
winterton
had
finished
his
repast
and
was
getting
his
second
stoup
of
wine
heated
he
asked
where
he
was
to
sleep
to
the
which
question
the
host
replied
that
he
feared
he
would
like
others
be
obligated
to
make
a
bench
by
the
fireside
his
couch
all
the
beds
in
the
house
being
already
bespoke
or
occupied
every
one
of
them
is
double
said
the
man
save
only
one
the
which
is
paid
for
by
a
young
man
that
goes
off
at
break
of
day
and
who
is
already
asleep
at
this
winterton
swore
a
dreadful
oath
that
he
would
not
sleep
by
the
fire
after
riding
fifty
miles
while
there
was
half
a
bed
in
the
house
and
commanded
the
host
to
go
and
tell
the
young
man
that
he
must
half
blankets
with
him
my
grandfather
knew
that
this
could
only
refer
to
him
so
when
their
host
came
and
opened
the
sliding
doors
of
the
bed
he
feigned
himself
to
be
very
fast
asleep
at
the
back
of
the
bed
and
only
groaned
in
drowsiness
when
he
was
touched
o
let
him
alane
cried
winterton
i
ken
what
it
is
to
be
tired
so
as
there
room
enough
at
the
stock
when
i
have
drank
my
posset
creep
in
beside
him
my
grandfather
weary
as
he
was
lay
panting
with
apprehension
not
doubting
that
he
should
be
speedily
discovered
but
when
winterton
had
finished
his
drink
and
came
swaggering
and
jocose
to
be
his
bedfellow
he
kept
himself
with
his
face
to
the
wall
and
snored
like
one
who
was
in
haste
to
sleep
more
than
enough
insomuch
that
winterton
when
he
lay
down
gave
him
a
deg
with
his
elbow
and
swore
at
him
to
be
quiet
his
own
fatigue
however
soon
mastered
the
disturbance
which
my
grandfather
made
and
he
began
himself
to
echo
the
noise
in
defenceless
sincerity
on
hearing
him
thus
fettered
by
sleep
my
grandfather
began
to
consider
with
himself
what
he
ought
to
do
being
both
afraid
and
perplexed
he
knew
not
wherefore
and
he
was
prompted
by
a
power
that
he
durst
not
and
could
not
reason
with
to
rise
and
escape
from
the
jeopardy
wherein
he
then
was
but
how
could
this
be
done
for
the
house
was
still
open
and
travellers
and
customers
were
continually
going
and
coming
truly
his
situation
was
one
of
great
tribulation
and
escape
therefrom
a
thing
seemingly
past
hope
and
the
unaided
wisdom
of
man
chapter
xii
after
lying
about
the
period
of
an
hour
in
great
perturbation
he
began
to
grow
more
collected
and
the
din
and
resort
of
strangers
in
the
house
also
subsided
by
which
he
was
enabled
with
help
from
on
high
to
gather
his
scattered
thoughts
and
to
bind
them
up
into
the
sheaves
of
purpose
and
resolution
accordingly
when
all
was
still
and
several
young
men
that
were
sitting
by
the
fire
on
account
of
every
bed
being
occupied
gave
note
by
their
deep
breathing
that
sleep
had
descended
upon
them
and
darkened
their
senses
with
her
gracious
and
downy
wings
he
rose
softly
from
the
side
of
winterton
and
stepping
over
him
slipped
to
the
door
which
he
unbarred
and
the
moon
shining
bright
he
went
to
the
stable
to
take
out
his
horse
it
was
not
his
intent
to
have
done
this
but
to
have
gone
up
into
the
streets
of
the
city
and
walked
the
walls
thereof
till
he
thought
his
adversary
was
gone
but
seeing
the
moon
so
fair
and
clear
he
determined
to
take
his
horse
and
forthwith
proceed
on
his
journey
for
the
river
was
low
and
fordable
and
trintled
its
waters
with
a
silvery
sheen
in
the
stillness
of
the
beautiful
light
scarcely
however
had
he
pulled
the
latch
of
the
stable
door
even
as
he
was
just
entering
in
when
he
heard
winterton
coming
from
the
house
rousing
the
hostler
whom
he
profanely
rated
for
allowing
him
to
oversleep
himself
for
wakening
just
as
his
bedfellow
rose
he
thought
the
morning
was
come
and
that
his
orders
had
been
neglected
in
this
extremity
my
grandfather
saw
no
chance
of
evasion
if
he
went
out
into
the
moonshine
he
would
to
a
surety
be
discovered
and
in
the
stable
he
would
to
a
certainty
be
caught
but
what
could
he
do
and
the
danger
so
pressing
he
had
hardly
a
choice
however
he
went
into
the
stable
shut
the
door
and
running
up
to
the
horses
that
were
farthest
ben
mounted
into
the
hack
and
hid
himself
among
the
hay
in
that
concealment
he
was
scarcely
well
down
when
winterton
with
an
hostler
that
was
half
asleep
came
with
a
lantern
to
the
door
banning
the
poor
knave
as
if
he
had
been
cursing
him
with
bell
book
and
candle
the
other
rubbing
his
eyes
and
declaring
it
was
still
far
from
morning
and
saying
he
was
sure
the
other
traveller
was
not
gone
to
the
which
there
was
speedy
evidence
for
on
going
towards
winterton
horse
the
hostler
saw
my
grandfather
in
its
stall
and
told
him
so
at
that
moment
a
glimpse
of
the
lantern
fell
on
the
horse
legs
and
its
feet
being
white
oho
cried
winterton
let
us
look
here
kenneth
shelty
lightfoot
the
very
beast
and
hae
i
been
in
the
same
hole
the
tod
and
no
kent

the
deil
black
collie

my
soul
but
this
is
a
soople
trick
i
did
nae
think
the
sleekit
sinner
had
art
enough
to
nae
doubt
he
gane
to
hide
himsel
in
the
town
till
i

heard
what
i
said
yestreen
but
i
be
up
sides
wi
him
the
a
foot
will
i
gang
this
morning
till
he
comes
back
for
his
horse
and
with
these
words
he
turned
out
of
the
stable
with
the
hostler
and
went
back
to
the
house
no
sooner
were
they
well
gone
than
my
grandfather
came
from
his
and
twisting
a
wisp
of
straw
round
his
horse
feet
that
they
might
not
dirl
or
make
a
din
on
the
stones
he
led
it
cannily
out
and
down
to
the
river
brink
and
there
mounting
took
the
ford
and
was
soon
free
on
the
gorbals
side
riding
up
the
gait
at
a
brisk
trot
he
passed
on
for
a
short
time
along
the
road
that
he
had
been
told
led
to
kilmarnock
but
fearing
he
would
be
followed
he
turned
off
at
the
first
wynd
he
came
to
on
the
left
and
a
blessed
thing
it
was
that
he
did
so
for
it
led
to
the
town
of
paisley
where
he
arrived
an
hour
before
daylight
winterton
little
jealousing
what
had
happened
went
again
to
bed
as
my
grandfather
afterwards
learnt
and
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
morning
when
he
awoke
and
was
told
that
both
man
and
horse
were
flown
he
flayed
the
hostler
back
and
legs
in
more
than
a
score
of
places
believing
he
had
connived
at
my
secret
flight
my
grandfather
had
never
before
been
in
the
town
of
paisley
but
he
had
often
heard
from
abercorn
that
were
wont
to
sorn
about
his
father
smiddy
of
a
house
of
jovial
entertainment
by
the
about
a
from
the
the
hostess
whereof
was
a
certain
canty
dame
called
maggy
napier
then
in
great
repute
with
the
shavelings
of
the
abbey
thither
he
directed
his
course
the
abbey
towers
serving
him
for
her
sign
and
the
moonlight
and
running
river
were
guides
to
her
door
at
the
which
he
was
not
blate
in
chapping
she
was
however
long
of
giving
entrance
for
it
happened
that
some
nights
before
the
magistrates
of
the
town
had
been
at
a
carousal
with
the
abbot
and
chapter
the
papistical
denomination
for
the
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
of
a
monastery
and
when
they
had
come
away
and
were
going
home
one
of
them
bailie
pollock
a
gaucy
widower
was
instigated
by
the
devil
and
the
wine
he
had
drunk
to
stravaig
towards
maggy
napier
a
most
unseemly
thing
for
a
bailie
to
do
especially
a
bailie
of
paisley
but
it
was
then
the
days
of
popish
sinfulness
and
when
bailie
pollock
went
thither
the
house
was
full
of
riotous
swankies
who
being
the
waur
of
drink
themselves
had
but
little
reverence
for
a
magistrate
in
the
same
state
so
they
handled
him
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
obliged
to
keep
his
bed
and
put
collops
to
his
eyes
for
three
days
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
the
house
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
the
town
council
and
maggie
was
admonished
to
keep
it
more
orderly
and
doucely
though
the
fault
came
neither
from
her
nor
her
customers
as
she
told
my
grandfather
for
detaining
him
so
long
it
being
requisite
that
she
should
see
he
was
in
a
condition
of
sobriety
before
letting
him
in
but
when
admitted
he
was
in
no
spirit
to
enjoy
her
jocosity
concerning
bailie
pollock
spree
so
he
told
her
that
he
had
come
far
and
had
far
to
go
and
that
having
heard
sore
tidings
of
a
friend
he
was
fain
to
go
to
bed
and
try
if
he
could
compose
himself
with
an
hour
or
two
of
sleep
maggie
accordingly
refrained
from
her
jocularity
and
began
to
soothe
and
comfort
him
for
she
was
naturally
of
a
winsome
way
and
prepared
a
bed
for
him
with
her
best
sheets
the
which
she
said
were
her
in
gratus
gift
frae
the
lord
abbot
so
that
he
undressed
himself
and
enjoyed
a
pleasant
interregnum
of
anxiety
for
more
than
five
hours
and
when
he
awoke
and
was
up
he
found
a
breakfast
worthy
of
the
abbot
himself
ready
and
his
hostess
was
most
courtly
and
kind
praising
the
dainties
and
pressing
him
to
eat
nor
when
he
proposed
to
reckon
with
her
for
the
lawin
would
she
touch
the
money
but
made
him
promise
when
he
came
back
he
would
bide
another
night
with
her
hoping
he
would
then
be
in
better
spirits
for
she
was
wae
to
see
so
braw
a
gallant
sae
casten
down
doless
and
dowie
when
they
had
settled
their
contest
and
my
grandfather
had
come
out
to
mount
his
beast
which
a
stripling
was
holding
ready
for
him
at
a
near
the
as
he
was
going
thither
a
young
friar
who
was
taking
a
morning
stroll
along
the
pleasant
banks
of
the
cart
approached
towards
him
and
after
looking
hard
at
him
for
some
time
called
him
by
name
and
took
him
by
both
the
hands
which
he
pressed
with
a
brotherly
affection
this
friar
was
of
lithgow
parentage
and
called
dominick
callender
and
when
he
and
my
grandfather
were
they
had
spent
many
a
merry
day
of
their
young
years
together
as
he
grew
up
being
a
lad
of
shrewd
parts
and
of
a
very
staid
and
orderly
deportment
the
monks
set
their
snares
for
him
and
before
he
could
well
think
for
himself
he
was
wiled
into
their
traps
and
becoming
a
novice
in
due
season
professed
himself
a
monk
but
it
was
some
time
before
my
grandfather
knew
him
again
for
the
ruddy
of
youth
had
fled
his
cheek
and
he
was
pale
and
of
a
studious
countenance
and
when
the
first
sparklings
of
his
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
his
old
had
gone
off
his
eyes
saddened
into
thoughtfulness
and
he
appeared
like
one
weighed
down
with
care
and
heavy
inward
dule
chapter
xiii
after
dominick
callender
and
my
grandfather
had
conversed
some
time
with
many
interchanges
of
the
kindly
remembrances
of
past
pleasures
the
gentle
friar
began
to
bewail
his
sad
estate
in
being
a
professed
monk
and
so
mournfully
to
deplore
the
rashness
with
which
inexperienced
youth
often
takes
upon
itself
a
yoke
it
can
never
lay
down
that
the
compassion
of
his
friend
was
sorrowfully
awakened
for
he
saw
he
was
living
a
life
of
bitterness
and
grief
he
heard
him
however
without
making
any
reply
or
saying
anything
concerning
his
own
lot
of
hazard
and
adventure
for
considering
dominick
to
be
leagued
with
the
papistical
orders
he
did
not
think
him
safe
to
be
trusted
notwithstanding
the
unchanged
freshness
of
the
which
he
still
seemed
to
bear
in
his
heart
nor
even
had
he
not
felt
this
jealousy
would
he
have
thought
himself
free
to
speak
of
his
errand
far
less
to
have
given
to
any
stranger
aught
that
might
have
been
an
inkling
of
his
noble
zealous
but
secret
stirrings
for
the
weal
of
scotland
and
the
enfranchisement
of
the
worshippers
of
the
true
god
when
my
grandfather
had
arrived
at
his
horse
and
prepared
to
mount
dominick
callender
said
to
him
if
he
would
ride
slowly
for
a
little
way
he
would
walk
by
his
side
adding
for
maybe
i
see
you
again
i
of
this
way
of
life
and
the
signs
of
the
times
bode
no
good
to
the
church
i
hae
a
thought
to
go
into
some
foreign
land
where
i
may
taste
the
air
of
a
freeman
and
i
feel
myself
comforted
before
i
quit
our
auld
but
scotland
in
meeting
wi
ane
that
reminds
me
how
i
had
once
sunny
mornings
and
summer
days
this
was
said
so
much
in
the
sincerity
of
a
confiding
spirit
that
my
grandfather
could
not
refrain
from
observing
in
answer
that
he
feared
his
friar
cloak
did
not
sit
easy
upon
him
which
led
him
on
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
so
i
am
speaking
to
you
gilhaize
said
he
with
the
frank
heart
of
auld
langsyne
and
i
dinna
scruple
to
confess
to
one
that
i
hae
often
thought
of
and
to
see
again
and
wondered
what
had
become
of
that
my
conscience
has
revolted
against
the
errors
of
the
papacy
and
that
i
am
now
upon
the
eve
of
fleeing
my
native
land
and
joining
the
reformed
at
geneva
and
maybe
i
no
ordain
to
spend
a
my
life
in
exile
for
no
man
can
deny
that
the
people
of
scotland
are
not
inwardly
the
warm
adversaries
of
the
church
that
last
and
cruellest
deed
the
sacrifice
of
the
feckless
old
man
of
fourscore
and
upward
has
proven
that
the
humanity
of
the
world
will
no
longer
endure
the
laws
and
pretensions
of
the
church
and
there
are
few
in
paisley
whom
the
burning
of
auld
mill
has
not
kindled
with
the
spirit
of
resistance
the
latter
portion
of
these
words
was
as
joyous
tidings
to
my
grandfather
and
he
tightened
his
reins
and
entered
into
a
more
particular
and
inquisitive
discourse
with
his
companion
by
which
he
gathered
that
the
martyrdom
of
master
mill
had
indeed
caused
great
astonishment
and
wrath
among
the
pious
in
and
about
paisley
and
not
only
among
them
but
had
estranged
the
affections
even
of
the
more
worldly
from
the
priesthood
of
whom
it
was
openly
said
that
the
sense
of
pity
towards
the
commonalty
of
mankind
was
extinguished
within
them
and
that
they
were
all
in
all
for
themselves
but
as
they
were
proceeding
through
the
town
and
along
the
road
conversing
in
a
familiar
but
earnest
manner
on
these
great
concerns
dominick
callender
began
to
inveigh
against
the
morals
of
his
brethren
and
to
lament
again
in
a
very
piteous
manner
that
he
was
decreed
by
his
monastic
profession
from
the
enjoyment
of
the
dearest
and
tenderest
pleasures
of
man
and
before
they
separated
it
came
out
that
he
had
been
for
some
time
touched
with
the
soft
enchantments
of
love
for
a
young
maiden
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
of
good
account
in
paisley
and
that
her
chaste
piety
was
as
the
precious
gum
wherewith
the
egyptians
of
old
preserved
their
dead
in
everlasting
beauty
keeping
from
her
presence
all
taint
of
impurity
and
of
thoughts
sullying
to
innocence
insomuch
that
even
were
he
inclined
as
he
said
many
of
his
brethren
would
have
been
to
have
acted
the
part
of
a
secret
canker
to
that
fair
blossom
the
gracious
and
holy
embalmment
of
her
virtues
would
have
proved
an
incorruptible
protection
but
he
exclaimed
with
a
sorrowful
voice
that
which
is
her
glory
and
my
admiration
and
praise
is
converted
by
the
bondage
of
my
unnatural
vows
into
a
curse
to
us
both
the
felicity
that
we
might
have
enjoyed
together
in
wedded
life
is
forbidden
to
us
as
a
great
crime
but
the
laws
of
god
are
above
the
canons
of
the
church
the
voice
of
nature
is
louder
than
the
fulminations
of
the
vatican
and
i
have
resolved
to
obey
the
one
and
give
ear
to
the
other
despite
the
horrors
that
await
on
apostacy
can
you
gilhaize
in
aught
assist
my
resolution
there
was
so
much
vehemence
and
the
passion
of
grief
in
these
ejaculations
that
my
grandfather
wist
not
well
what
to
say
he
told
him
however
not
to
be
rash
in
what
he
did
nor
to
disclose
his
intents
save
only
to
those
in
whom
he
could
confide
for
the
times
were
perilous
to
everyone
that
slackened
in
reverence
to
the
papacy
particularly
to
such
as
had
pastured
within
the
chosen
folds
of
the
church
bide
said
he
till
you
see
what
issue
is
ordained
to
come
from
this
dreadful
deed
which
so
shaketh
all
the
land
making
the
abbey
towers
topple
and
tremble
to
their
oldest
and
deepest
foundations
truth
is
awakened
and
gone
forth
conquering
and
to
conquer
it
can
not
be
that
ancient
iniquities
will
be
much
longer
endured
the
arm
of
wrath
is
raised
against
them
the
sword
of
revenge
is
drawn
forth
from
its
scabbard
by
justice
and
nature
has
burst
asunder
the
cords
of
the
roman
harlot
and
stands
in
her
freedom
like
samson
when
the
spirit
of
the
lord
was
mightily
poured
upon
him
as
he
awoke
from
the
lap
of
delilah
the
gentle
friar
as
my
grandfather
often
told
stood
for
some
time
astounded
at
this
speech
and
then
he
said
i
dreamt
not
gilhaize
that
beneath
a
countenance
so
calm
and
comely
the
zealous
fires
of
a
warrior
bravery
could
have
been
kindled
to
so
vehement
a
heat
but
i
will
vex
you
with
no
questions
heaven
is
on
your
side
and
may
its
redeeming
promptings
never
allow
its
ministers
to
rest
till
the
fetters
are
broken
and
the
slaves
are
set
free
with
these
words
he
stepped
forward
to
shake
my
grandfather
by
the
hand
and
to
bid
him
farewell
but
just
as
he
came
to
the
stirrup
he
halted
and
said
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
the
remembrance
of
you
has
been
preserved
so
much
brighter
and
dearer
to
me
than
that
of
all
my
kin
there
was
aye
something
about
you
in
our
heedless
days
that
often
made
me
wonder
i
could
not
tell
wherefore
and
now
when
i
behold
you
in
the
prime
of
manhood
it
fills
me
with
admiration
and
awe
and
makes
me
do
homage
to
you
as
a
master
much
more
he
added
to
the
same
effect
which
the
modesty
of
my
grandfather
would
not
allow
him
to
repeat
but
when
they
had
parted
and
my
grandfather
had
ridden
forward
some
two
or
three
miles
he
recalled
to
mind
what
had
passed
between
them
and
he
used
to
say
that
this
discourse
with
his
early
friend
first
opened
to
him
a
view
of
the
grievous
captivity
which
nature
suffered
in
the
monasteries
and
convents
notwithstanding
the
loose
lives
imputed
to
their
inmates
and
he
saw
that
the
reformation
would
be
hailed
by
many
that
languished
in
the
bondage
of
their
vows
as
a
great
and
glorious
deliverance
but
still
he
was
wont
to
say
even
with
such
as
these
it
was
overly
mingled
with
temporal
concernments
and
that
they
longed
for
it
less
on
account
of
its
immortal
issues
than
for
its
sensual
emancipations
and
as
he
was
proceeding
on
his
way
in
this
frame
of
mind
and
thinking
on
all
that
he
had
seen
and
learnt
from
the
day
in
which
he
bade
adieu
to
his
father
house
he
came
to
a
place
where
the
road
forked
off
in
two
different
airts
and
not
knowing
which
to
take
he
stopped
his
horse
and
waited
till
a
man
drew
nigh
whom
he
observed
coming
towards
him
by
this
man
he
was
told
that
the
road
leading
leftward
led
to
kilmarnock
and
ayr
and
the
other
on
the
right
to
kilwinning
so
without
saying
anything
he
turned
his
horse
head
into
the
latter
the
which
he
was
moved
to
do
by
sundry
causes
and
reasons
first
he
had
remarked
that
the
chances
in
his
journey
had
in
a
very
singular
manner
led
him
to
gain
much
of
that
sort
of
knowledge
which
the
lords
of
the
congregation
thirsted
for
and
second
he
had
no
doubt
that
winterton
was
in
pursuit
of
him
to
kilmarnock
for
some
purpose
of
frustration
or
circumvention
the
which
though
he
was
not
able
to
divine
he
could
not
but
consider
important
if
it
was
as
he
thought
the
prime
motive
of
that
journey
but
he
was
chiefly
disposed
to
prefer
the
kilwinning
road
though
it
was
several
miles
more
of
on
account
of
the
rich
abbacy
in
that
town
hoping
he
might
glean
and
gather
some
account
how
the
clergy
there
stood
affected
the
meeting
with
dominick
callender
having
afforded
him
a
vista
of
friends
and
auxiliaries
in
the
enemy
camp
little
thought
of
besides
all
this
he
reflected
that
as
it
was
of
consequence
he
should
reach
the
lord
boyd
in
secrecy
he
would
be
more
likely
to
do
so
by
stopping
at
kilwinning
and
feeing
someone
there
to
guide
him
to
the
dean
castle
by
moonlight
i
have
heard
him
say
however
the
speakable
motives
of
his
deviation
from
the
straight
road
were
at
the
time
far
less
effectual
in
moving
him
thereto
than
a
something
which
he
could
not
tell
that
with
an
invisible
hand
took
his
horse
as
it
were
by
the
and
constrained
him
to
go
into
the
kilwinning
track
in
the
whole
of
this
journey
there
was
indeed
a
very
extraordinary
manifestation
of
a
special
providence
not
only
in
the
protection
vouchsafed
towards
himself
but
in
the
remarkable
accidents
and
occurrences
by
which
he
was
enabled
to
enrich
himself
with
the
knowledge
so
precious
at
that
time
to
those
who
were
chosen
to
work
the
great
work
of
the
gospel
in
scotland
chapter
xiv
as
my
grandfather
came
in
sight
of
kilwinning
and
beheld
the
abbey
with
its
lofty
horned
towers
and
spiky
pinnacles
and
the
sands
of
cunningham
between
it
and
the
sea
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
huge
leviathan
had
come
up
from
the
depths
of
the
ocean
and
was
devouring
the
green
inland
having
already
consumed
all
the
herbage
of
the
wide
waste
that
lay
so
bare
and
yellow
for
many
a
mile
desert
and
lonely
in
the
silent
sunshine
and
he
ejaculated
to
himself
that
the
frugal
soil
of
poor
scotland
could
have
been
designed
to
pasture
such
enormities
as
he
rode
on
his
path
descended
from
the
heights
into
pleasant
tracks
along
banks
feathered
with
the
fragrant
plumage
of
the
birch
and
hazel
and
he
forgot
in
hearkening
to
the
cheerful
prattle
of
the
garnock
waters
as
they
swirled
among
the
pebbles
by
the
roadside
the
pageantries
of
that
mere
bodily
worship
which
had
worked
on
the
ignorance
of
the
world
to
raise
such
costly
monuments
of
the
patience
of
heaven
while
they
showed
how
much
the
divine
nature
of
the
infinite
god
and
the
humility
of
his
eternal
son
had
been
forgotten
in
this
land
among
professing
christians
when
he
came
nigh
the
town
he
inquired
for
an
hostel
and
a
stripling
the
miller
son
who
was
throwing
stones
at
a
flock
of
geese
belonging
to
the
abbey
then
taking
their
pleasures
uninvited
in
his
guided
him
to
the
house
of
theophilus
lugton
the
chief
vintner
and
stabler
in
the
town
where
on
alighting
he
was
very
kindly
received
for
the
gudewife
was
of
a
stirring
household
nature
and
theophilus
himself
albeit
douce
and
temperate
for
a
publican
was
a
man
obliging
and
hospitable
not
only
as
became
him
in
his
trade
but
from
a
disinterested
he
was
indeed
as
my
grandfather
came
afterwards
to
know
really
a
person
holden
in
great
respect
and
repute
by
the
visitors
and
pilgrims
who
resorted
to
the
abbey
and
by
none
more
than
by
the
worthy
wives
of
irvine
the
most
regular
of
his
customers
for
they
being
then
in
the
darkness
of
papistry
were
as
much
given
to
the
idolatry
of
holidays
and
masses
as
thanks
be
and
praise
they
are
now
to
the
hunting
out
of
sound
gospel
preachers
and
sacramental
occasions
many
a
stoup
of
burnt
wine
and
spiced
ale
they
were
wont
at
pace
and
yule
and
other
papistal
high
times
to
partake
of
together
in
the
house
of
theophilus
lugton
happy
and
well
content
when
their
possets
were
flavoured
with
the
ghostly
conversation
of
some
gawsie
monk
well
versed
in
the
mysteries
of
requiems
and
purgatory
having
parted
with
his
horse
to
be
taken
to
the
stable
by
theophilus
himself
my
grandfather
walked
into
the
house
and
dame
lugton
set
for
him
an
by
the
chimla
lug
and
while
she
was
preparing
something
for
a
repast
they
fell
into
conversation
in
the
course
of
which
she
informed
him
that
a
messenger
had
come
to
the
abbey
that
forenoon
from
edinburgh
and
a
rumour
had
been
bruited
about
soon
after
his
arrival
that
there
was
great
cause
to
dread
a
rising
among
the
heretics
for
being
ingrained
with
papistry
she
so
spoke
of
the
reformers
this
news
troubled
my
grandfather
not
a
little
and
the
more
he
inquired
concerning
the
tidings
the
more
reason
he
got
to
be
alarmed
and
to
suspect
that
the
bearer
was
winterton
who
being
still
in
the
town
and
then
at
the
abbey
his
horse
was
in
theophilus
lugton
stable
he
could
not
but
think
that
in
coming
to
kilwinning
instead
of
going
right
on
to
kilmarnock
he
had
run
into
the
lion
mouth
but
seeing
it
was
so
and
could
not
be
helped
he
put
his
trust
in
the
lord
and
resolved
to
swerve
in
no
point
from
the
straight
line
which
he
had
laid
down
for
himself
while
he
was
eating
of
dame
lugton
fare
with
the
relishing
sauce
of
a
keen
appetite
in
a
manner
that
no
one
who
saw
him
could
have
supposed
he
was
almost
sick
with
a
surfeit
of
anxieties
one
james
coom
a
smith
came
in
for
a
of
ale
and
he
seeing
a
traveller
said
thir
sair
news
the
drouth
of
cauld
iron
will
be
slockened
in
blood
ere
we
hear
the
end
replied
my
grandfather
it
very
alarming
lucky
here
has
just
been
telling
me
that
there
likely
to
be
a
straemash
among
the
reformers
surely
they
daur
to
rebel
if
a
tales
be
true
that
no
to
do
said
the
smith
blowing
the
froth
from
the
cap
in
which
dame
lugton
handed
him
the
ale
and
taking
a
right
waught
but
what
said
inquired
my
grandfather
when
the
smith
had
fetched
his
breath
naebody
can
weel
tell
was
his
response
a
that
come
this
length
is
but
the
sough
afore
the
storm
within
twa
hours
there
has
been
a
great
riding
hither
and
yon
and
a
lad
straight
frae
embro
has
come
to
bid
my
lord
abbot
repair
to
the
court
and
three
chiels
hae
been
at
me
frae
eglinton
castle
to
get
their
beast
shod
for
a
journey
my
lord
there

of

our
leddy
the

here
her

poor
auld
deaf
and
dumb
creature
she
has
na
i
doubt
the
pith
to
warsle
wi
the
blast
she
ance
in
a
day
had
haud
that
heretical
tongue
o
thine
jamie
coom
exclaimed
dame
lugton
it
enough
to
gaur
a
body
hair
stand
on
end
to
hear
o
your
familiarities
wi
the
holy
virgin
i
my
lord
abbot
has
na
langsyne
tethert
thy
tongue
to
the
kirk
door
wi
a

for
sic
blasphemy
but
fools
are
privileged
and
so
seen
o
thee
and
wha
made
me
familiar
wi
her
dame
lugton
tell
me
that
replied
james
was
na
it
my
lord
himself
at
last
marymas
when
he
sent
for
me
to
make
a
hoop
to
mend
her
leg
that
sklintered
aff
as
they
were
dressing
her
for
the
show
eh
little
did
i
think
that
i
was
ever
to
hae
the
honour
and
glory
of
a
nail
intil
the
timber
hip
o
the
virgin
mary
ah
lucky
ye
would
na
hae
tholed
the
dirl
o
the
dints
o
my
hammer
as
she
did
but
she
a
saint
and
ye
deny
that
ye
a
sinner
to
this
dame
lugton
was
unable
to
reply
and
the
smith
cunningly
winking
dippet
his
head
up
to
the
lugs
in
the
but
said
my
grandfather
no
to
speak
wi
disrespeck
of
things
considered
wi
reverence
it
does
na
seem
to
me
that
there
is
ony
cause
to
think
the
reformers
hae
yet
rebelled
i
am
sure
replied
the
smith
if
they
hae
na
they
ought
or
the
a
spunk
amang
them
isna
a
the
monks
frae
john
o
groat
to
the
border
getting
ready
their
spits
and
rackses
and
branders
to
cook
them
like
capons
and
doos
for
horney
supper
i
never
hear
my
ain
bellows
snoring
at
a
gaud
o
iron
in
the
fire
but
i
think
o
fat
father
lickladle
the
abbey
head
kitchener
roasting
me
the
low
like
a
laverock
in
his
for
as
dame
lugton
there
weel
kens
i
ane
o
the
reformed
heh
but
it
a
braw
thing
this
reformation
it
used
to
cost
me
as
muckle
siller
for
the
sin
o
getting
fu
no
aboon
three
or
four
times
in
the
year
as
would
hae
kept
ony
honest
man
blithe
and
ree
frae
to
hogmanæ
but
our
worthy
hostess
has
found
to
her
profit
that
i
now
ane
of
her
best
customers
what
say
ye
lucky
truly
said
dame
lugton
laughing
thou
no
an
ill
swatch
o
the
reformers
and
naebody
need
be
surprised
at
the
growth
o
heresy
wha
thinks
o
the
dreadfu
cost
the
professors
used
to
be
at
for
pardons
but
maybe
they
soon
find
that
the
as
hard
a
taxer
as
the
kirk
was
for
ever
since
thou
has
refraint
frae
paying
penance
thy
weekly
calks
ahint
the
door
been
on
the
increase
jamie
and
no
ae
plack
has
thou
mair
to
spare
so
muckle
gude
thy
reforming
has
done
thee
bide
awee
lucky
cried
the
smith
setting
down
the
which
he
had
just
emptied
bide
awee
and
ye
see
a
change
surely
it
was
to
be
expecket
considering
the
spark
in
my
hass
that
the
first
use
i
would
mak
o
the
freedom
o
the
reformation
would
be
to
quench
it
which
i
never
was
allowed
to
do
afore
and
whenever
that
done
see
me
a
geize
keg
o
sobriety
tak
the
word
o
a
drouthy
smith
at
this
jink
o
their
controversy
who
should
come
into
the
house
ringing
ben
to
the
with
his
iron
heels
and
the
rattling
rowels
o
his
spurs
but
winterton
without
observing
my
grandfather
who
was
then
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
window
light
in
the
at
the
chimla
lug
and
when
he
had
ordered
dame
lugton
to
spice
him
a
drink
of
her
best
brewing
he
began
to
joke
and
jibe
with
the
blacksmith
the
which
allowing
my
grandfather
time
to
compose
his
wits
which
were
in
a
degree
startled
he
saw
that
he
could
not
but
be
discovered
so
he
thought
it
was
best
to
bring
himself
out
accordingly
in
as
quiet
a
manner
as
he
was
able
to
put
on
he
said
to
winterton
i
hae
a
notion
that
we
twa
forgathered
no
lang
sincesyne
at
the
sound
of
these
words
winterton
gave
a
loup
as
if
he
had
tramped
on
something
no
canny
syne
a
whirring
sort
of
triumphant
whistle
and
then
a
shout
crying
ha
ha
tod
lowrie
hae
i
yirded
you
at
last
but
instanter
he
recollected
himsel
and
giving
my
grandfather
a
significant
look
as
if
he
wished
him
no
to
be
particular
he
said
i
heard
o
you
gilhaize
on
the
road
and
i
was
fain
to
hae
come
up
wi
you
that
we
might
hae
travelled
thegither
howsever
i
lost
scent
at
glasgow
and
then
he
continued
to
haver
with
him
in
his
loose
and
profligate
manner
anent
the
glasgow
damsels
till
the
ale
was
ready
when
he
pressed
my
grandfather
to
taste
never
letting
wot
how
they
had
slept
together
in
the
same
bed
and
my
grandfather
on
his
part
was
no
less
circumspect
for
he
discerned
that
winterton
intended
to
come
over
him
and
he
was
resolved
to
be
on
his
guard
chapter
xv
when
winterton
had
finished
his
drink
which
he
did
hastily
he
proposed
to
my
grandfather
that
they
should
take
a
stroll
through
the
town
and
my
grandfather
being
eager
to
throw
stour
in
his
eyes
was
readily
consenting
thereto
weel
said
the
knave
when
he
had
warily
led
him
into
the
abbey
i
didna
think
ye
would
hae
gane
back
to
my
lord
but
it
very
weel
since
he
has
looked
what
past
and
you
a
new
dark
he
very
indulgent
replied
my
grandfather
and
i
would
be
looth
to
wrang
so
kind
a
master
and
he
looked
at
winterton
the
varlet
however
never
winced
but
rejoined
lightly
but
i
wish
you
had
come
back
to
widow
rippet
for
ye
would
hae
me
a
hard
ride
scarcely
had
ye
the
road
when
my
lord
mindit
that
he
had
neglekit
to
gie
you
the
sign
by
the
which
ye
were
to
make
yoursel
and
message
kent
to
his
friends
and
i
was
sent
after
to
tell
you
i
glad
o
that
replied
my
grandfather
what
winterton
was
a
thought
molested
by
this
thrust
of
a
question
and
for
the
space
of
about
a
minute
said
nothing
till
he
had
considered
with
himself
when
he
rejoined
three
lads
were
sent
off
about
the
same
time
wi
you
and
the
earl
was
nae
quite
sure
he
said
whilk
of
you
a
he
had
forgotten
to
gie
the
token
whereby
ye
would
be
known
as
his
men
but
the
sign
for
the
earl
of
eglinton
to
whom
i
guess
ye
hae
been
sent
by
coming
to
kilwinning
is
no
the
same
as
for
the
lord
boyd
to
whom
i
thought
ye
had
been
missioned
for
i
hae
been
at
the
dean
castle
and
finding
you
not
there
followed
you
hither
i
be
plain
wi
you
said
my
grandfather
to
this
draughty
speech
i
bound
to
the
lord
boyd
but
coming
through
paisley
when
i
reached
the
place
where
the
twa
roads
branched
i
took
the
ane
that
brought
me
here
instead
of
the
gate
to
kilmarnock
so
as
soon
as
my
beast
has
eaten
his
corn
i
mean
to
double
back
to
the
dean
castle
how
in
the
name
of
the
saints
and
souls
did
ye
think
in
going
frae
glasgow
to
kilmarnock
o
taking
the
road
to
paisley
an
ye
were
acquaint
said
my
grandfather
wi
how
little
i
knew
o
the
country
ye
would
nae
speir
that
question
but
since
we
hae
fallen
in
thegither
and
are
baith
ye
ken
in
my
lord
service
i
hope
you
no
objek
to
ride
back
wi
me
to
the
lord
boyd
then
it
no
you
that
was
sent
to
the
earl
of
eglinton
exclaimed
winterton
pretending
more
surprise
than
he
felt
and
all
my
journey
has
been
for
naething
howsever
i
go
back
wi
you
to
kilmarnock
and
the
sooner
we
gang
the
better
little
farther
discourse
then
passed
for
they
returned
to
the
hostel
and
ordering
out
their
horses
were
soon
on
the
road
and
as
they
trotted
along
winterton
was
overly
outspoken
against
the
papisticals
calling
them
all
kinds
of
ill
names
and
no
sparing
the
queen
regent
but
my
grandfather
kept
a
calm
tongue
and
made
no
reflections
howsever
said
winterton
pulling
up
his
bridle
and
walking
his
horse
as
they
were
skirting
the
moor
of
irvine
leaving
the
town
about
a
mile
off
on
the
right
you
and
me
gilhaize
that
are
but
servants
need
nae
fash
our
heads
wi
sic
things
the
wyte
o
wars
lie
at
the
doors
of
kings
and
the
soldiers
are
free
o
the
sin
o
them
but
how
will
ye
get
into
the
presence
and
confidence
of
the
lord
boyd
i
thought
replied
my
grandfather
pawkily
that
ye
had
gotten
our
master
token
and
i
maun
trust
to
you
oh
cried
winterton
i
got
but
the
ane
for
the
lad
sent
to
eglinton
castle
and
ye
been
there
said
my
grandfather
winterton
didna
let
wot
that
he
heard
this
but
stooping
over
on
the
of
his
horse
pretended
he
was
righting
something
about
his
my
grandfather
was
however
resolved
to
prob
him
to
the
quick
so
when
he
was
again
sitting
upright
he
repeated
the
question
if
he
had
been
to
eglinton
castle
o
ay
cried
the
false
loon
i
was
there
but
the
bird
was
flown
and
how
got
he
the
ear
of
the
earl
said
my
grandfather
not
having
the
sign
in
for
a
penny
in
for
a
pound
was
winterton
motto
and
ae
lie
with
him
was
father
to
a
race
luckily
for
him
replied
he
some
of
the
kent
him
as
being
in
glencairn
service
so
they
took
him
to
their
master
my
grandfather
had
no
doubt
that
there
was
some
truth
in
this
though
he
was
sure
winterton
knew
little
about
it
for
it
agreed
with
what
james
coom
the
smith
had
said
about
the
lads
from
eglinton
that
had
been
at
his
smiddy
to
get
the
horses
shod
and
remembering
the
leathern
purses
under
the
earl
his
master
pillow
he
was
persuaded
that
there
had
been
a
messenger
sent
to
the
head
of
the
montgomeries
and
likewise
to
other
lords
friends
of
the
congregation
but
he
saw
that
winterton
went
by
guess
and
lied
at
random
still
though
not
affecting
to
notice
it
nor
expressing
any
distrust
he
could
not
help
saying
to
him
that
he
had
come
a
long
way
and
after
all
it
looked
like
a
gowk
errand
the
remark
however
only
served
to
give
winterton
inward
satisfaction
and
he
replied
with
a
laugh
that
it
made
little
odds
to
him
where
he
was
sent
and
that
he
as
lief
ride
in
ayrshire
as
sorn
about
the
causey
of
enbrough
in
this
sort
of
talk
and
conference
they
rode
on
together
the
every
now
and
then
of
winterton
discourse
being
concerning
the
proof
my
grandfather
carried
with
him
whereby
the
lord
boyd
would
know
he
was
one
of
glencairn
men
but
notwithstanding
all
his
wiles
and
devices
to
howk
the
secret
out
of
him
his
drift
being
so
clearly
discerned
my
grandfather
was
enabled
to
play
with
him
till
they
were
arrived
at
kilmarnock
where
winterton
proposed
to
stop
till
he
had
delivered
his
message
to
the
lord
boyd
at
the
dean
castle
that
surely
can
not
be
replied
my
grandfather
for
ye
ken
as
there
has
been
some
mistak
about
the
sign
whereby
i
am
to
make
myself
known
ye
to
come
wi
me
to
expound
in
case
of
need
in
trooth
now
that
we
hae
forgatherit
and
as
i
but
this
ae
message
to
a
the
shire
of
ayr
i
would
fain
your
company
till
i
see
the
upshot
winterton
could
not
very
easily
make
a
refusal
to
this
but
he
hesitated
and
swithered
till
my
grandfather
urged
him
again
when
seeing
no
help
for
it
and
his
companion
as
he
thought
entertaining
no
suspicion
of
him
he
put
on
a
bold
face
and
went
forward
when
they
had
come
to
the
dean
castle
which
stands
in
a
pleasant
green
park
about
a
mile
aboon
the
of
kilmarnock
on
entering
the
gate
my
grandfather
hastily
alighted
and
giving
his
horse
a
sharp
prick
of
his
spur
as
he
lap
off
the
beast
ran
capering
out
of
his
hand
round
the
court
of
the
castle
with
the
voice
of
great
anxiety
my
grandfather
cried
to
the
servants
to
shut
the
gate
and
keep
it
in
and
winterton
alighting
ran
to
catch
it
giving
his
own
horse
to
a
stripling
to
hold
at
the
same
moment
however
my
grandfather
sprung
upon
him
and
seizing
him
by
the
throat
cried
out
for
help
to
master
a
spy
winterton
was
so
confounded
that
he
gasped
and
looked
round
like
a
man
demented
and
my
grandfather
ordered
him
to
be
taken
by
the
to
their
master
before
whom
when
they
were
all
come
he
recounted
the
story
of
his
adventures
with
the
prisoner
telling
his
lordship
what
his
master
the
earl
of
glencairn
suspected
of
him
to
which
when
winterton
was
asked
what
he
had
to
say
he
replied
bravely
that
it
was
all
true
and
he
was
none
ashamed
to
be
so
catched
when
it
was
done
by
so
clever
a
fellow
he
was
then
ordered
by
the
lord
boyd
to
be
immured
in
the
the
which
may
be
seen
to
this
day
and
though
his
captivity
was
afterwards
somewhat
relaxed
he
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
the
castle
till
after
the
death
of
the
queen
dowager
and
the
of
her
councils
this
exploit
won
my
grandfather
great
favour
and
he
scarcely
needed
to
show
the
when
he
told
his
message
from
the
lords
of
the
congregation
chapter
xvi
by
such
devices
and
missions
as
my
grandfather
was
engaged
in
for
the
earl
glencairn
with
the
lord
boyd
a
thorough
understanding
was
concerted
among
the
reformed
throughout
the
kingdom
and
encouraged
by
their
great
strength
and
numbers
which
far
exceeded
what
was
expected
the
lords
of
the
congregation
set
themselves
roundly
to
work
and
the
protestant
preachers
openly
published
their
doctrines
soon
after
my
grandfather
had
returned
from
the
shire
of
ayr
there
was
a
weighty
consultation
held
at
the
earl
his
patron
lodging
in
edinburgh
whereat
among
others
present
was
that
pious
youth
afterwards
the
good
regent
murray
he
was
by
office
and
appointment
then
the
head
and
lord
of
the
priory
of
st
andrews
but
his
soul
cleaving
to
the
reformation
and
the
gospel
he
laid
down
the
use
of
that
title
and
about
this
time
began
to
be
called
the
lord
james
stuart
the
lords
of
the
congregation
feeling
themselves
strong
in
the
goodness
of
their
cause
and
the
number
of
their
adherents
resolved
at
this
council
that
they
should
proceed
firmly
but
considerately
to
work
and
seek
redress
as
became
true
lieges
by
representation
and
supplication
accordingly
a
paper
was
drawn
up
wherein
they
set
forth
how
for
conscience
sake
the
reformed
had
been
long
afflicted
with
banishment
confiscation
of
goods
and
death
in
its
cruellest
forms
that
continual
fears
darkened
their
lives
till
being
no
longer
able
to
endure
such
calamities
they
were
compelled
to
beg
a
remedy
against
the
oppressions
and
tyranny
of
the
estate
ecclesiastical
which
had
usurped
an
unlimited
domination
over
the
minds
of
men
the
faggot
and
the
sword
being
the
weapons
which
the
prelates
employed
to
enforce
their
mandates
plain
truths
that
were
thus
openly
stated
in
order
to
show
that
the
suppliants
were
sincere
and
they
concluded
with
a
demand
that
the
original
purity
of
the
christian
religion
should
be
restored
and
the
government
so
improved
as
to
afford
them
security
in
their
persons
opinions
and
property
sir
james
calder
of
sandilands
was
the
person
chosen
to
present
this
memorial
to
the
queen
regent
and
never
said
my
grandfather
was
an
agent
more
fitly
chosen
to
uphold
the
dignity
of
his
trust
or
to
preserve
the
respect
which
as
good
subjects
the
reformed
desired
to
maintain
and
manifest
towards
the
authority
regal
he
was
a
man
far
advanced
in
life
but
there
was
none
of
the
infirmities
of
age
under
the
venerable
exterior
with
which
time
had
clothed
his
appearance
of
great
honour
and
a
pure
life
he
was
reverenced
by
all
parties
and
had
acquired
both
renown
and
affection
through
his
services
to
the
realm
and
his
manifold
virtues
on
a
day
appointed
by
the
queen
regent
the
lords
and
leaders
of
the
congregation
attended
sandilands
each
with
a
stately
retinue
to
holyrood
house
my
grandfather
having
leave
from
the
earl
his
master
to
wait
on
his
person
on
that
occasion
it
was
a
solemn
day
to
the
worshippers
of
the
true
god
who
came
in
great
multitudes
to
the
town
many
from
distant
parts
to
be
present
and
to
hear
the
issue
of
a
conference
that
was
to
give
liberty
to
the
consciences
of
all
devout
scotchmen
from
the
house
in
the
lawnmarket
where
the
lords
assembled
down
to
the
very
yetts
of
the
palace
the
sight
was
as
if
the
street
had
been
paved
with
faces
and
windows
over
windows
roofs
and
were
clustered
with
women
and
children
all
temporal
cares
and
businesses
were
that
day
suspended
in
the
accents
and
voices
of
men
there
was
an
awful
sobriety
few
speaking
and
what
was
said
sounded
as
if
every
one
was
affected
with
the
sense
of
some
high
and
everlasting
interest
at
stake
when
the
lords
went
down
into
the
street
there
was
for
a
brief
interval
a
stir
and
a
murmur
in
the
multitude
which
opened
to
the
right
and
left
as
when
the
waves
of
the
red
sea
were
opened
and
through
the
midst
thereof
prepared
a
miraculous
road
for
the
children
of
israel
a
deep
silence
succeeded
and
sandilands
with
his
hoary
head
uncovered
bearing
in
his
hand
the
supplication
and
remonstrance
walked
forward
and
the
lords
went
after
also
all
bareheaded
and
every
one
with
them
followed
in
like
manner
as
reverentially
as
their
masters
the
people
as
they
passed
along
slowly
and
devoutly
took
off
their
caps
and
bonnets
and
bowed
their
heads
as
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
was
of
old
brought
back
from
the
philistines
and
many
wept
and
others
prayed
aloud
and
there
was
wonder
and
awe
and
dread
mingled
with
thoughts
of
unspeakable
confidence
and
glory
when
sandilands
and
those
with
him
were
conducted
into
the
presence
of
the
queen
dowager
she
was
standing
under
a
canopy
of
state
surrounded
by
many
of
the
nobles
and
prelates
and
by
her
maidens
of
honour
my
grandfather
had
not
seen
her
before
and
having
often
heard
her
suspected
of
and
of
a
superstitious
zeal
and
affection
for
the
papal
abominations
and
cruelties
he
had
pictured
to
himself
a
lean
and
haggard
woman
with
a
pale
and
fierce
countenance
and
was
therefore
greatly
amazed
when
he
beheld
a
lady
of
a
most
sweet
and
gracious
aspect
with
mild
dark
eyes
beaming
with
a
chaste
dignity
and
a
high
and
fair
forehead
bright
and
unwrinkled
with
any
care
and
lips
formed
to
speak
soft
and
gentle
sentences
in
her
apparel
she
was
less
gay
than
her
ladies
but
nevertheless
she
was
more
queenly
her
dress
and
mantle
were
of
the
richest
purple
genoese
unadorned
with
embroidery
and
round
her
neck
she
wore
a
ruff
of
fine
ermine
and
a
string
of
princely
pearls
a
small
golden
cross
of
curious
graven
gold
dangled
to
her
waist
from
a
loup
in
the
vale
of
her
bosom
sandilands
advanced
several
paces
before
the
lords
by
whom
he
was
attended
and
falling
on
his
knees
read
with
a
loud
and
firm
voice
the
memorial
of
the
reformed
and
when
he
had
done
so
and
was
risen
the
queen
received
a
paper
that
was
given
to
her
by
her
secretary
who
stood
behind
her
right
shoulder
and
also
read
an
answer
which
had
been
prepared
and
in
which
she
was
made
to
deliver
many
comfortable
assurances
that
at
the
time
were
received
as
a
great
boon
with
much
thankfulness
by
all
the
reformed
who
had
too
soon
reason
to
prove
the
insincerity
of
those
courtly
flatteries
for
no
steps
were
afterwards
taken
to
give
those
indulgences
by
law
that
were
promised
but
the
papists
stirring
themselves
with
great
activity
and
foreign
matters
and
concerns
coming
in
aid
of
their
stratagems
long
before
a
year
passed
the
mind
of
the
queen
and
government
was
fomented
into
hostility
against
the
protestants
she
called
into
her
favour
and
councils
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
with
whom
she
had
been
at
variance
and
the
devout
said
when
they
heard
thereof
that
when
our
saviour
was
condemned
on
the
same
day
herod
and
pilate
were
made
friends
applying
the
text
to
this
reconcilation
and
boding
therefrom
woe
to
the
true
church
moved
by
the
hatred
which
his
grace
bore
to
the
reformers
the
queen
cited
the
protestant
preachers
to
appear
at
stirling
to
answer
to
the
charges
which
might
there
be
preferred
against
them
my
grandfather
when
this
perfidy
came
to
a
head
was
at
in
the
shire
of
renfrew
with
the
earl
his
master
who
when
he
heard
of
such
a
breach
of
faith
smote
the
table
as
he
was
then
sitting
at
dinner
with
his
right
hand
and
said
since
the
false
woman
has
done
this
there
is
nothing
for
us
but
the
banner
and
the
blade
and
starting
from
his
seat
he
forthwith
ordered
horses
and
attended
by
my
grandfather
and
ten
armed
servants
rode
to
glasgow
where
sir
hugh
campbell
of
loudon
then
sheriff
of
ayr
and
other
worthies
of
the
time
were
assembled
on
business
before
the
lords
of
justiciary
and
it
was
instanter
agreed
that
they
should
forthwith
proceed
to
stirling
where
the
court
was
and
remonstrate
with
the
queen
so
leaving
all
temporal
concerns
sir
hugh
took
horse
and
they
arrived
at
stirling
about
the
time
her
highness
supped
and
going
straight
to
the
castle
they
stood
in
the
to
speak
if
possible
with
her
as
she
passed
on
entering
the
room
to
pass
to
her
table
she
saw
them
and
looked
somewhat
surprised
and
displeased
but
without
saying
anything
particular
she
desired
the
earl
to
follow
her
and
sir
hugh
unbidden
went
also
into
the
it
was
seldom
that
she
used
state
in
her
household
and
on
this
occasion
it
being
a
popish
fast
her
table
was
frugally
spread
and
only
herself
sat
at
the
board
well
glencairn
said
she
what
has
brought
you
hither
from
the
west
at
this
time
is
the
realm
to
be
forever
tossed
like
the
sea
by
this
tempest
of
heresies
the
royal
authority
is
not
always
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
and
in
spite
of
all
their
friends
the
protestant
preachers
shall
be
banished
from
scotland
aye
though
their
doctrines
were
as
sound
as
st
paul
the
earl
as
my
grandfather
heard
him
afterwards
relate
replied
your
majesty
gave
your
royal
promise
that
the
reformed
should
be
protected
and
they
have
done
nothing
since
to
cause
the
forfeiture
of
so
gracious
a
boon
i
implore
your
majesty
to
call
that
sacred
pledge
to
mind
you
lack
reason
my
lord
she
cried
sharply
it
becomes
not
subjects
to
burden
their
princes
with
promises
which
it
may
be
inconvenient
to
keep
if
these
madam
are
your
sentiments
replied
the
earl
proudly
the
congregation
can
no
longer
acknowledge
your
authority
and
must
renounce
their
allegiance
to
your
government
she
had
at
the
moment
lifted
the
to
sprinkle
her
salad
but
she
was
so
astonished
at
the
boldness
of
this
speech
that
she
dropped
it
from
her
hand
and
the
salt
was
spilt
on
the
floor
an
evil
omen
which
all
present
noted
my
lord
glencairn
said
she
thoughtfully
i
would
execute
my
great
duties
honestly
but
your
preachers
trouble
the
waters
and
i
know
not
where
the
ford
lies
that
i
may
safest
ride
go
ye
away
and
try
to
keep
your
friends
quiet
and
i
will
consider
calmly
what
is
best
to
be
done
for
the
weal
of
all
at
these
words
the
earl
and
sir
hugh
campbell
bowed
and
retiring
went
to
the
lodging
of
the
earl
of
monteith
where
they
were
minded
to
pass
the
night
but
when
they
had
consulted
with
that
nobleman
my
grandfather
was
ordered
to
provide
himself
with
a
fresh
horse
from
monteith
stable
and
to
set
out
for
edinburgh
with
letters
for
the
lord
james
stuart
gilhaize
said
his
master
as
he
delivered
them
i
foresee
we
must
buckle
on
our
armour
but
the
cause
of
the
truth
does
not
require
that
the
first
blow
should
come
from
our
side
by
this
time
john
knox
who
has
been
long
expected
may
be
hourly
looked
for
and
as
no
man
stands
higher
in
the
aversion
of
the
papists
than
that
brave
honest
man
we
shall
know
by
the
reception
he
meets
with
what
we
ought
to
do
so
my
grandfather
putting
the
letters
in
his
bosom
retired
from
the
presence
of
the
earl
and
by
break
of
day
reached
the
and
went
straight
on
to
the
lord
james
stuart
lodging
in
the
canongate
but
though
the
household
were
astir
it
was
some
time
before
he
got
admittance
for
their
master
was
a
young
man
of
great
method
in
all
things
and
his
chaplain
was
at
the
time
reading
the
first
prayers
of
the
morning
during
which
the
doors
were
shut
and
no
one
however
urgent
his
business
could
gain
admission
into
that
house
while
the
inmates
were
doing
their
homage
to
the
king
of
kings
chapter
xvii
as
my
grandfather
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
was
waiting
in
the
canongate
till
the
worship
was
over
in
the
house
of
the
lord
james
stuart
he
frequently
rode
up
and
down
the
street
as
far
the
luckenbooths
and
the
abbey
sanctuary
siver
and
his
mind
was
at
times
smitten
with
the
remorse
of
pity
when
he
saw
as
the
dawn
advanced
the
numbers
of
poor
labouring
men
that
came
up
out
of
the
closes
and
gathered
round
the
trone
abiding
there
to
see
who
would
come
to
hire
them
for
the
day
but
his
compassion
was
soon
changed
into
a
frame
of
thankfulness
at
the
boundless
variety
of
mercies
which
are
dealt
out
to
the
children
of
adam
for
he
remarked
that
for
the
most
part
these
poor
men
whose
sustenance
was
as
precarious
as
that
of
the
wild
birds
of
the
air
were
cheerful
and
jocund
many
of
them
singing
and
whistling
as
blithely
as
the
lark
that
carries
the
sweet
incense
of
her
melodious
songs
in
the
censer
of
a
sinless
breast
to
the
golden
gates
of
the
morning
hitherto
he
had
never
noted
or
much
considered
the
complicated
cares
and
trials
wherewith
the
lot
of
man
in
every
station
is
chequered
and
environed
and
when
he
heard
those
bondmen
of
hard
labour
jocund
after
sound
slumbers
and
light
suppers
laughing
contemptuously
as
they
beheld
the
humiliating
sight
which
divers
gallants
and
youngsters
courtiers
of
the
court
degraded
with
debauch
made
of
themselves
as
they
stumbled
homeward
he
thought
there
was
surely
more
bliss
in
the
cup
that
was
earned
by
the
constancy
of
health
and
a
willing
mind
than
in
all
the
possets
and
malvesia
that
the
hoards
of
ages
could
procure
so
he
composed
his
spirit
and
inwardly
made
a
vow
to
the
lord
that
as
soon
as
the
mighty
work
of
the
redemption
of
the
gospel
from
the
perdition
of
papistry
was
accomplished
he
would
retire
into
the
lea
of
some
pleasant
green
holm
and
take
for
the
purpose
of
his
life
the
attainment
of
that
happy
simplicity
which
seeks
but
the
supply
of
the
few
wants
with
which
man
comes
so
rich
from
the
hands
of
his
maker
that
all
changes
in
his
natural
condition
of
tilling
the
ground
and
herding
the
flocks
only
serve
to
make
him
poorer
by
increasing
while
he
was
thus
ruminating
in
the
street
he
observed
two
strangers
coming
up
the
canongate
one
of
them
had
the
appearance
of
a
servant
but
he
was
of
a
staider
and
more
thoughtful
aspect
than
belongs
to
men
of
that
degree
only
he
bore
on
his
shoulder
a
willease
and
had
in
his
hand
a
small
package
wrapt
in
a
woollen
cover
and
buckled
with
a
leathern
strap
the
other
was
the
master
and
my
grandfather
halted
his
horse
to
look
at
him
as
he
passed
for
he
was
evidently
no
common
man
nor
mean
personage
though
in
stature
he
was
jimp
the
ordinary
size
he
was
bent
more
with
infirmities
than
the
load
of
his
years
his
hair
and
long
flowing
beard
were
very
grey
and
venerable
like
those
of
the
ancient
patriarchs
who
enjoyed
immediate
communion
with
god
but
though
his
appearance
was
thus
aged
and
though
his
complexion
and
countenance
betokened
a
frail
tenement
yet
the
brightness
of
youth
shone
in
his
eyes
and
they
were
lighted
up
by
a
spirit
over
which
time
had
no
power
in
his
steps
and
gait
he
was
a
little
hasty
and
unsteady
and
twice
or
thrice
he
was
obliged
to
pause
in
the
steep
of
the
street
to
draw
his
breath
but
even
in
this
there
was
an
affecting
and
great
earnestness
a
working
of
a
living
soul
within
as
if
it
panted
to
enter
on
the
performance
of
some
great
and
solemn
hest
he
seemed
to
be
eager
and
zealous
like
the
apostle
peter
in
his
temper
and
as
dauntless
as
the
mighty
and
courageous
paul
many
in
the
street
stopped
and
looked
after
him
with
reverence
and
marvelling
as
he
proceeded
with
quick
and
desultory
steps
followed
by
his
sedate
attendant
nor
was
it
surprising
for
he
was
indeed
one
of
those
who
in
their
lives
are
vast
and
wonderful
special
creations
that
are
sent
down
from
heaven
with
authority
attested
by
the
glowing
impress
of
the
signet
of
god
on
their
hearts
to
avenge
the
wrongs
done
to
his
truths
and
laws
in
the
blasphemies
of
the
it
was
john
knox
when
he
had
passed
my
grandfather
rode
back
to
the
yett
of
the
lord
james
stuart
lodgings
which
by
this
time
was
opened
and
instanter
on
mentioning
to
the
porter
from
whom
he
had
come
was
admitted
to
his
master
that
great
worthy
was
at
the
time
sitting
alone
in
a
back
chamber
which
looked
towards
salisbury
crags
and
before
him
but
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
among
divers
letters
and
papers
of
business
lay
a
large
bible
with
brass
clasps
thereon
in
which
it
would
seem
some
one
had
been
expounding
to
him
a
portion
of
the
scriptures
when
my
grandfather
presented
to
him
the
letter
from
the
earl
of
glencairn
he
took
it
from
him
without
much
regarding
him
and
broke
open
the
seal
and
began
to
peruse
it
to
himself
in
that
calm
and
methodical
manner
for
which
he
was
so
famed
and
remarkable
before
however
he
had
read
above
the
half
thereof
he
gave
as
it
were
a
sudden
hitch
and
turning
round
looked
my
grandfather
sharply
in
the
face
and
said
are
you
gilhaize
but
before
any
answer
could
be
made
he
waved
his
hand
graciously
pointing
to
a
chair
and
desired
him
to
sit
down
resuming
at
the
same
time
the
perusal
of
the
letter
and
when
he
had
finished
it
he
folded
it
up
for
a
moment
but
as
if
recollecting
himself
he
soon
runkled
it
up
in
his
hand
and
put
it
into
the
fire
your
lord
informs
me
said
he
that
he
has
all
confidence
not
only
in
your
honesty
gilhaize
but
in
your
discernment
and
says
that
in
respect
to
the
high
question
anent
christ
cause
you
may
be
trusted
to
the
uttermost
truly
for
so
young
a
man
this
is
an
exceeding
renown
his
letter
has
told
me
what
passed
last
night
with
the
queen
highness
i
am
grieved
to
hear
it
she
means
well
but
her
feminine
fears
make
her
hearken
to
counsels
that
may
cause
the
very
evils
whereof
she
is
so
afraid
but
the
sincerity
of
her
favour
to
the
reformed
will
soon
be
tried
for
last
night
john
knox
arrived
and
i
was
with
him
and
strong
in
the
assurances
of
his
faith
he
intends
to
lead
on
to
the
battle
this
morning
he
was
minded
to
depart
for
captain
christ
jesus
said
he
satan
his
adversary
are
now
at
open
defiance
their
banners
are
displayed
and
the
trumpet
is
blown
on
both
sides
for
assembling
their
armies
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
he
is
within
the
kingdom
we
shall
learn
what
we
may
expect
and
that
presently
too
for
this
very
day
the
clergy
meet
in
the
monastery
of
the
greyfriars
and
doubtless
they
will
be
advertised
of
his
coming
you
had
as
well
try
if
you
can
gain
admittance
among
the
other
auditors
to
hear
their
deliberations
afterwards
come
again
to
me
and
report
what
takes
place
by
that
time
i
shall
be
advised
whether
to
send
you
back
to
glencairn
or
elsewhere
my
grandfather
after
this
and
some
farther
discourse
retired
to
the
hall
and
took
breakfast
with
the
household
where
he
was
much
edified
with
the
douce
deportment
of
all
present
so
unlike
that
of
the
lewd
and
graceless
varlets
who
rioted
in
the
houses
of
the
other
nobles
verily
he
used
to
say
the
evidences
of
a
reforming
spirit
were
brightly
seen
there
and
to
rule
every
one
into
a
chaste
sobriety
of
conversation
a
pious
clerk
sate
at
the
head
of
the
board
and
said
grace
before
and
after
the
meal
making
it
manifest
how
much
all
things
about
the
lord
james
stuart
were
done
in
order
having
taken
breakfast
and
reposed
himself
some
time
for
his
long
ride
had
made
him
very
weary
he
rose
and
changing
his
apparel
went
to
the
greyfriars
church
where
the
clergy
were
assembling
and
elbowing
himself
gently
into
the
heart
of
the
people
waiting
around
for
admission
he
got
in
with
the
crowd
when
the
doors
were
opened
the
matter
that
morning
to
be
considered
concerned
the
means
to
be
taken
within
the
local
jurisdictions
of
those
there
met
to
enforce
the
process
of
the
summons
which
had
been
issued
against
the
reformed
preachers
to
appear
at
stirling
but
while
they
were
busily
conversing
and
contriving
how
best
to
aid
and
further
that
iniquitous
aggression
of
perfidious
tyranny
there
came
in
one
of
the
brethren
of
the
monastery
with
a
frightened
look
and
cried
aloud
that
john
knox
was
come
and
had
been
all
night
in
the
town
at
the
news
the
spectators
as
if
moved
by
one
spirit
gave
a
triumphant
shout
the
clergy
were
thunderstruck
some
started
from
their
seats
unconscious
of
what
they
did
others
threw
themselves
back
where
they
sat
and
all
appeared
as
if
a
judgment
had
been
pronounced
upon
them
in
the
same
moment
the
church
began
to
skail
the
session
was
adjourned
and
the
people
ran
in
all
directions
the
cry
rose
everywhere
john
knox
is
come
all
the
town
came
rushing
into
the
streets
the
old
and
the
young
the
lordly
and
the
lowly
were
seen
mingling
and
marvelling
together
all
tasks
of
duty
and
servitude
and
pleasure
were
forsaken
the
of
the
dying
were
deserted
the
priests
abandoned
their
altars
and
masses
and
stood
pale
and
trembling
at
the
doors
of
their
churches
mothers
set
down
their
infants
on
the
floors
and
ran
to
inquire
what
had
come
to
pass
funerals
were
suspended
and
the
impious
and
the
guilty
stood
aghast
as
if
some
dreadful
apocalypse
had
been
made
travellers
with
the
bridles
in
their
hands
lingering
in
profane
discourse
with
their
hosts
suddenly
mounted
and
speeded
into
the
country
with
the
tidings
at
every
cottage
door
and
wayside
bield
the
inmates
stood
in
clusters
silent
and
wondering
as
horseman
came
following
horseman
crying
john
knox
is
come
barks
that
had
departed
when
they
heard
the
news
bore
up
to
tell
others
that
they
saw
afar
at
sea
the
shepherds
were
called
in
from
the
hills
the
warders
on
the
castle
when
at
the
sound
of
many
quickened
feet
approaching
they
challenged
the
comers
were
answered
john
knox
is
come
studious
men
were
roused
from
the
spells
of
their
books
nuns
at
their
windows
looked
out
fearful
and
inquiring
and
priests
and
friars
were
seen
standing
by
themselves
shunned
like
lepers
the
whole
land
was
stirred
as
with
the
inspiration
of
some
new
element
and
the
hearts
of
the
persecutors
were
withered
no
tongue
often
said
my
grandfather
could
tell
the
sense
of
that
great
event
through
all
the
bounds
of
scotland
and
the
papistical
dominators
shrunk
as
if
they
had
suffered
in
their
powers
and
principalities
an
awful
and
irremediable
overthrow
chapter
xviii
when
my
grandfather
left
the
greyfriars
he
went
to
the
lodging
of
the
lord
james
stuart
whom
he
found
well
instructed
of
all
that
had
taken
place
which
he
much
marvelled
at
having
scarcely
tarried
by
the
way
in
going
thither
now
gilhaize
said
my
lord
the
tidings
fly
like
wildfire
and
the
queen
regent
by
the
spirit
that
has
descended
into
the
hearts
of
the
people
will
be
constrained
to
act
one
way
or
another
john
knox
as
you
perhaps
know
stands
under
the
ban
of
outlawry
for
conscience
sake
in
a
little
while
we
shall
see
whether
he
is
still
to
be
persecuted
if
left
free
the
braird
of
the
lord
that
begins
to
rise
so
green
over
all
the
land
will
grow
in
peace
to
a
plentiful
harvest
but
if
he
is
to
be
hunted
down
there
will
come
such
a
cloud
and
storm
as
never
raged
before
in
scotland
i
speak
to
you
thus
freely
that
you
may
report
my
frank
sentiments
to
thir
noble
friends
and
trusty
gentlemen
and
say
to
them
that
i
am
girded
for
the
field
if
need
be
he
then
put
a
list
of
several
friends
of
the
reformation
ayont
the
frith
into
my
grandfather
hands
adding
i
need
not
say
that
it
is
not
fitting
now
to
trust
to
paper
and
therefore
much
will
depend
on
yourself
the
confidence
that
my
friend
the
earl
your
master
has
in
you
makes
me
deal
thus
openly
with
you
and
i
may
add
that
if
there
is
deceit
in
you
gilhaize
i
will
never
again
believe
the
physiognomy
of
man
so
go
your
ways
see
all
these
wheresoever
they
may
be
and
take
this
purse
for
your
charges
my
grandfather
accepted
the
paper
and
the
purse
and
reading
over
the
paper
imprinted
the
names
in
it
on
his
memory
and
then
said
my
lord
i
need
not
risk
the
possession
of
this
paper
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
give
me
some
token
by
which
the
lords
and
lairds
therein
mentioned
may
have
assurance
that
i
come
from
you
for
some
time
the
lord
james
made
no
reply
but
stood
ruminating
with
the
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
pressing
his
nether
lip
then
he
observed
your
request
is
very
needful
and
taking
the
paper
he
mentioned
divers
things
of
each
of
the
persons
named
in
it
which
he
told
my
grandfather
had
passed
between
him
and
them
severally
when
none
other
was
present
by
remembering
them
of
these
things
said
he
they
will
know
that
you
are
in
verity
sent
from
me
being
thus
instructed
my
grandfather
left
the
lord
james
and
proceeding
forthwith
to
the
pier
of
leith
embarked
in
the
burntisland
and
considering
with
himself
that
the
farthest
way
of
those
whom
he
was
missioned
to
see
ought
to
be
the
first
informed
as
the
nearer
had
other
ways
and
means
of
communion
he
resolved
to
go
forward
to
such
of
them
as
dwelt
in
angus
and
merns
by
which
resolution
he
reached
dundee
shortly
after
the
arrival
there
of
the
champion
of
the
reformation
john
knox
this
resolution
proved
most
wise
and
fortunate
for
on
landing
in
that
town
he
found
a
great
concourse
of
the
reformed
from
the
two
shires
assembled
there
and
among
them
many
of
those
to
whom
he
was
specially
sent
they
had
come
to
go
with
their
ministers
before
the
queen
counsel
at
stirling
determined
to
avow
their
adherence
to
the
doctrines
of
which
those
pious
men
were
accused
and
it
being
foreseen
that
as
they
went
forward
others
would
join
my
grandfather
thought
he
could
do
no
better
in
his
mission
than
mingle
with
them
the
more
especially
as
john
knox
was
also
to
be
of
that
great
company
on
the
day
following
they
accordingly
all
set
forward
towards
perth
and
they
were
a
glorious
army
mighty
with
the
strength
of
their
great
ally
the
lord
of
the
hosts
of
heaven
no
trumpet
sounded
in
their
march
nor
was
the
courageous
drum
heard
among
them
nor
the
shouts
of
earthly
soldiery
nor
the
neigh
of
the
nor
the
voice
of
any
captain
but
they
sang
hymns
of
triumph
and
psalms
of
the
great
things
that
jehovah
had
of
old
done
for
his
people
and
though
no
banner
was
seen
there
nor
sword
on
the
thighs
of
men
of
might
nor
spears
in
the
grasp
of
warriors
nor
crested
helmet
nor
aught
of
the
panoply
of
battle
yet
the
eye
of
faith
beheld
more
than
all
these
for
the
hills
and
heights
of
scotland
were
to
its
dazzled
vision
covered
that
day
with
the
mustered
armies
of
the
dreadful
god
the
angels
of
his
wrath
in
their
burning
chariots
the
archangels
of
his
omnipotence
calm
in
their
armour
of
storms
and
flaming
fires
and
the
rider
on
the
white
horse
were
all
there
as
the
people
with
their
ministers
advanced
their
course
was
like
a
river
which
continually
groweth
in
strength
and
spreadeth
its
waters
as
it
rolls
onward
to
the
sea
on
all
sides
came
streams
of
new
adherents
to
their
holy
cause
in
so
much
that
when
they
arrived
at
perth
it
was
thought
best
to
halt
there
lest
the
approach
of
so
great
a
multitude
though
without
weapons
should
alarm
the
queen
regent
government
accordingly
they
made
a
pause
and
erskine
of
dun
one
of
the
lord
james
stuart
friends
taking
my
grandfather
with
him
and
only
two
other
servants
rode
forward
to
stirling
to
represent
to
her
highness
the
faith
and
the
firmness
of
the
people
when
they
arrived
they
found
the
town
in
consternation
busy
were
the
bailies
marshalling
such
of
the
burgesses
as
could
be
persuaded
to
take
up
arms
but
all
who
joined
them
were
feckless
aged
men
dealers
and
traffickers
in
commodities
for
the
courtiers
proud
was
the
provost
that
day
and
a
type
of
the
cause
for
which
he
was
gathering
his
papistical
remnants
at
the
sight
of
dun
and
his
three
followers
riding
up
the
street
to
the
castle
he
was
fain
to
draw
out
his
sword
and
make
a
salutation
but
it
stuck
sae
dourly
in
that
he
was
obligated
to
gar
ane
of
the
hold
the
scabbard
while
he
pulled
with
such
might
and
main
at
the
hilt
that
the
blade
suddenly
broke
off
and
back
he
stumbled
and
up
flew
his
heels
so
that
even
my
grandfather
was
constrained
notwithstanding
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
to
join
in
the
shout
of
laughter
that
rose
thereat
from
all
present
but
provosts
and
bailies
not
being
men
of
war
should
not
expose
themselves
to
such
adversities
nor
was
the
fyke
of
impotent
preparation
within
the
walls
of
the
castle
better
the
queen
had
been
in
a
manner
lanerly
with
her
ladies
when
the
sough
of
the
coming
multitude
reached
her
the
french
guards
had
not
come
from
glasgow
and
there
was
none
of
the
warlike
nobles
of
the
papistical
sect
at
that
time
at
stirling
she
had
therefore
reason
both
for
dread
and
panic
when
the
news
arrived
that
all
angus
and
merns
had
rebelled
for
so
it
was
at
first
reported
on
the
arrival
of
dun
he
was
on
the
instant
admitted
to
her
presence
for
she
was
at
the
time
in
the
tapestried
chamber
surrounded
by
her
priests
and
ladies
and
many
officers
all
consulting
her
according
to
their
fears
the
sight
said
my
grandfather
for
he
also
went
into
the
presence
was
a
proof
to
him
that
the
cause
of
the
papacy
was
in
the
the
judgments
of
all
present
being
so
evidently
in
a
state
of
discomfiture
and
desertion
dun
going
forward
with
the
wonted
reverences
the
queen
said
to
him
abruptly
well
erskine
what
is
this
whereupon
he
represented
to
her
in
a
sedate
manner
that
the
reformed
ministers
were
not
treated
as
they
had
been
encouraged
to
hope
nevertheless
to
show
their
submission
to
those
in
temporal
authority
over
them
they
were
coming
in
obedience
to
the
citation
to
stand
trial
but
their
retinue
when
have
delinquents
come
to
trial
so
attended
she
exclaimed
eagerly
the
people
please
your
highness
said
dun
with
a
steadfastness
of
manner
that
struck
every
one
with
respect
for
him
the
people
hold
the
same
opinions
and
believe
the
same
doctrines
as
their
preachers
and
they
feel
that
the
offence
if
it
be
offence
of
which
the
ministers
are
accused
lies
equally
against
them
and
therefore
they
have
resolved
to
make
their
case
a
common
cause
and
do
they
mean
to
daunt
us
from
doing
justice
against
seditious
schismatics
cried
her
highness
somewhat
in
anger
they
mean
replied
dun
to
let
your
highness
see
whether
it
be
possible
to
bring
so
many
to
judgment
their
sentiment
with
one
voice
is
cursed
be
they
that
seek
the
effusion
of
blood
or
war
or
dissension
let
us
possess
the
evangile
and
none
within
scotland
shall
be
more
obedient
subjects
in
sooth
madam
they
hold
themselves
as
guilty
of
the
crime
charged
as
their
ministers
are
and
they
will
suffer
with
them
suffer
call
you
rebellion
suffering
exclaimed
the
queen
they
have
not
yet
rebelled
said
dun
calmly
they
come
to
remonstrate
with
your
highness
first
for
as
christians
they
are
loth
to
draw
the
sword
they
have
no
arms
with
them
to
the
end
that
no
one
may
dare
to
accuse
them
of
any
treason
it
is
a
perilous
thing
when
subjects
said
the
queen
much
troubled
declare
themselves
so
openly
against
the
authority
of
their
rulers
it
is
a
bold
thing
for
rulers
replied
dun
to
meddle
with
the
consciences
of
their
subjects
how
exclaimed
the
queen
startled
and
indignant
i
will
deal
yet
more
plainly
with
your
highness
said
he
firmly
this
pretended
offence
of
which
the
reformed
are
accused
is
not
against
the
royal
authority
they
are
good
and
true
subjects
and
by
their
walk
and
conversation
bear
testimony
to
the
excellence
and
purity
of
those
doctrines
for
which
they
are
resolved
to
sacrifice
their
lives
rather
than
submit
to
any
earthly
dictation
their
controversies
pertain
to
things
of
christ
kingdom
it
is
a
spiritual
warfare
but
the
papists
conscious
of
their
weakness
in
the
argument
would
fain
see
your
highness
abandon
that
impartial
justice
which
you
were
called
of
heaven
to
administer
in
your
great
office
and
to
act
factiously
on
their
side
as
if
the
cause
of
the
gospel
could
be
determined
by
the
arm
of
flesh
what
has
brought
you
here
exclaimed
the
queen
bursting
into
tears
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
your
royal
promises
said
dun
making
a
lowly
reverence
that
by
its
humility
took
away
all
arrogance
from
the
boldness
of
the
demand
i
will
said
she
i
am
ever
willing
to
be
just
but
this
rising
has
shaken
me
with
apprehensions
therefore
i
pray
you
erskine
write
to
your
brethren
bid
them
disperse
and
tell
them
from
me
that
their
ministers
shall
neither
be
tried
nor
molested
at
these
words
she
took
the
arm
of
one
of
her
ladies
and
hastily
retired
dun
also
withdrew
and
the
same
hour
sent
my
grandfather
back
to
perth
with
letters
to
the
congregation
to
the
effect
of
her
request
and
assurance
that
same
evening
the
multitude
broke
up
and
returned
to
their
respective
homes
rejoicing
with
an
exceeding
great
joy
at
so
blessed
a
termination
of
their
weaponless
christian
war
dun
however
distrusting
the
influence
of
some
of
those
who
were
of
the
queen
council
and
who
had
arrived
at
the
castle
soon
after
my
grandfather
departure
did
not
return
as
he
had
intended
next
morning
to
perth
but
resolved
to
wait
over
the
day
of
trial
or
at
least
until
the
ministers
were
absolved
from
attendance
on
the
summons
either
by
proclamation
or
other
forms
of
law
chapter
xix
john
knox
among
all
the
ministers
who
remained
at
perth
after
the
congregation
of
the
reformed
had
dispersed
was
the
only
one
my
grandfather
has
been
heard
to
say
that
expressed
no
joy
nor
exultation
at
the
assurances
of
the
queen
regent
we
shall
see
we
shall
see
was
all
he
said
to
those
among
them
who
gloried
in
the
victory
adding
but
if
there
is
truth
in
the
word
of
god
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
the
beast
to
do
otherwise
than
evil
and
his
words
of
discernment
and
of
wisdom
were
soon
verified
erskine
of
dun
while
he
remained
at
stirling
had
his
eyes
and
ears
open
and
in
their
porches
he
placed
for
sentinels
distrust
and
suspicion
he
knew
the
fluctuating
nature
of
woman
how
every
succeeding
wave
of
feeling
washes
away
the
deepest
traces
that
are
traced
on
the
quicksands
of
her
unstable
humours
and
the
danger
having
passed
he
jealoused
that
the
queen
regent
would
forget
her
terrors
and
give
herself
up
to
the
headlong
councils
of
the
adversaries
whom
from
her
known
adherence
to
the
romish
ritual
he
justly
feared
she
was
inclined
to
favour
nor
was
he
left
long
in
doubt
on
the
evening
before
the
day
which
had
been
appointed
for
the
trial
no
proclamation
or
other
token
was
promulged
to
appease
the
anxiety
of
the
cited
preachers
he
therefore
thought
it
needful
to
be
prepared
for
the
worst
so
accordingly
he
ordered
his
two
to
have
his
horses
in
readiness
forth
the
town
in
the
morning
and
there
to
abide
his
orders
without
giving
any
other
about
him
the
slightest
inkling
of
what
he
had
conceited
he
went
up
betimes
to
the
castle
having
learnt
that
the
queen
regent
was
that
day
to
hold
a
council
and
being
a
man
held
in
great
veneration
by
all
parties
and
well
known
to
the
household
of
the
court
he
obtained
access
to
the
after
the
council
was
met
and
standing
there
he
was
soon
surprised
by
her
highness
coming
out
leaning
on
the
arm
of
the
lord
wintoun
and
seemingly
much
disturbed
on
seeing
him
she
was
startled
and
paused
for
a
moment
but
soon
collecting
all
her
pride
she
dropped
the
lord
wintoun
arm
and
walked
straight
through
the
apartment
without
noticing
any
one
and
holding
herself
aloft
with
an
air
of
resolute
dignity
dun
augured
no
good
from
this
but
following
till
the
lord
wintoun
had
attended
her
to
the
end
of
the
long
painted
gallery
where
she
stopped
at
the
door
that
opened
to
her
private
apartments
he
there
awaited
that
nobleman
return
and
inquired
of
him
if
the
process
against
the
protestant
ministers
had
been
rescinded
no
said
wintoun
peevishly
the
summons
have
been
called
over
and
they
have
not
appeared
either
in
person
or
by
agents
say
you
so
my
lord
cried
dun
and
what
is
the
result
outlawry
for
is
pronounced
against
them
replied
wintoun
haughtily
and
went
straight
back
into
the
dun
thought
it
unnecessary
to
inquire
farther
so
without
making
more
ado
he
instanter
left
the
castle
and
going
down
the
town
went
to
the
spot
where
his
horses
stood
ready
and
mounting
rode
off
with
the
tidings
to
perth
grieving
sorely
at
the
gross
perfidy
and
sad
deceit
which
the
queen
regent
had
been
so
practised
on
by
the
heads
of
the
papist
faction
to
commit
it
happened
on
the
same
day
that
john
knox
who
remained
at
perth
a
wakeful
warder
on
a
post
of
peril
was
moved
by
the
spirit
of
god
to
preach
a
sermon
in
which
he
exposed
the
idolatry
of
the
mass
and
the
depravity
of
my
grandfather
was
present
and
he
often
said
that
preaching
was
an
era
and
epoch
worthy
to
be
held
in
everlasting
remembrance
it
took
place
in
the
greyfriars
church
there
was
an
understanding
among
the
people
that
it
was
to
be
there
but
many
fearing
the
monks
might
attempt
to
prevent
it
a
vast
concourse
chiefly
men
assembled
at
the
ordinary
mass
hour
and
remained
in
the
church
till
the
reformer
came
so
that
had
the
friars
tried
to
keep
him
out
they
could
not
have
shut
the
doors
a
lane
was
made
through
the
midst
of
the
crowd
to
admit
the
preacher
to
the
pulpit
and
when
he
was
seen
advancing
aged
and
feeble
and
leaning
on
his
staff
many
were
moved
with
compassion
and
doubted
if
it
could
be
the
wonderful
man
of
whom
every
tongue
spoke
but
when
he
had
ascended
and
began
he
seemed
to
undergo
a
great
transfiguration
his
abject
mien
and
his
sickly
visage
became
majestic
and
glorious
his
eyes
lightened
his
countenance
shone
as
with
the
radiance
of
a
spirit
that
blazed
within
and
his
voice
dirled
to
the
heart
like
vehement
thunder
sometimes
he
spoke
to
the
understandings
of
those
who
heard
him
of
that
insane
doctrine
which
represented
the
mission
of
the
redeemer
to
consist
of
believing
in
despite
of
sight
and
smell
and
touch
and
taste
that
wafers
and
wine
were
actually
the
flesh
and
blood
of
a
man
that
was
crucified
with
nails
driven
through
his
feet
and
hands
many
hundred
years
ago
then
rising
into
the
contemplation
of
the
divinity
of
the
saviour
he
trampled
under
the
feet
of
his
eloquence
a
belief
so
contrary
to
the
instincts
and
senses
with
which
infinite
wisdom
has
gifted
his
creatures
and
bursting
into
ecstasy
at
the
thought
of
this
idolatrous
invention
he
called
on
the
people
to
look
at
the
images
and
the
effigies
in
the
building
around
them
and
believe
if
they
could
that
such
things
the
of
carpenters
and
masons
were
endowed
with
miraculous
energies
far
above
the
faculties
of
man
kindling
into
a
still
higher
mood
he
preached
to
those
very
images
and
demanded
of
them
and
those
they
represented
to
show
any
proof
that
they
were
entitled
to
reverence
god
forgive
my
idolatry
he
exclaimed
i
forget
myself
these
things
are
but
stocks
and
stones
not
one
of
all
who
heard
him
that
day
ever
gave
ear
again
to
papistry
when
he
had
made
an
end
and
retired
from
the
church
many
still
lingered
discoursing
of
his
marvellous
lecture
and
among
others
my
grandfather
an
imprudent
priest
belonging
to
the
convent
little
aware
of
the
great
conversion
which
had
been
wrought
began
to
prepare
for
the
celebration
of
the
mass
and
a
callan
who
was
standing
near
encouraged
by
the
contempt
which
some
of
those
around
expressed
at
this
folly
jibed
the
priest
and
he
drove
him
away
the
boy
however
returned
and
levelling
a
stone
at
a
crucifix
on
the
altar
shattered
it
to
pieces
in
an
instant
as
if
caught
by
a
whirlwind
the
whole
papistical
trumpery
was
torn
down
and
dashed
into
fragments
the
cry
of
down
with
the
idols
became
universal
hundreds
on
hundreds
came
rushing
to
the
spot
the
magistrates
and
the
ministers
came
flying
to
beseech
order
and
to
soothe
the
multitude
but
a
divine
ire
was
upon
the
people
who
heard
no
voice
but
only
the
cry
of
down
with
the
idols
and
their
answer
was
burn
burn
and
destroy
the
monasteries
of
the
black
and
the
grey
friars
were
sacked
and
rendered
desolate
and
the
gorgeous
edifice
of
the
carthusian
monks
levelled
to
the
ground
so
dreadful
a
tumult
had
never
before
been
heard
of
within
the
realm
many
of
the
best
of
the
reformed
deplored
the
handle
it
would
give
to
the
blasphemies
of
their
foes
even
my
grandfather
was
smitten
with
consternation
and
grief
for
he
could
not
but
think
that
such
a
temporal
outrage
would
be
followed
by
a
terrible
temporal
revenge
as
ruthless
and
complete
sober
minds
shuddered
at
the
sudden
and
sacrilegious
overthrow
of
such
venerable
structures
and
many
that
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
house
of
papistical
bondage
and
were
on
the
point
of
leaving
it
retired
in
again
and
barred
the
doors
against
the
light
and
hugged
their
errors
as
blameless
compared
with
such
enormities
to
no
one
did
the
event
give
pleasure
but
to
john
knox
the
work
said
he
has
been
done
it
is
true
by
the
rascal
multitude
but
when
the
nests
are
destroyed
the
rooks
will
fly
away
the
thing
however
most
considered
at
that
time
was
the
panic
which
this
intemperance
would
cause
to
the
queen
regent
and
my
grandfather
seeing
it
had
changed
the
complexion
of
his
mission
resolved
to
return
the
same
evening
by
the
queensferry
to
the
lord
james
stuart
at
edinburgh
for
the
people
no
sooner
cooled
and
came
to
a
sense
of
reflection
than
they
discerned
that
they
had
committed
a
heinous
offence
against
the
laws
and
apprehending
punishment
prepared
to
defend
themselves
thus
by
the
irresolute
and
policy
of
the
queen
was
the
people
maddened
into
grievous
excesses
and
many
of
those
who
submitted
quietly
in
the
faith
of
her
assurances
and
had
returned
to
their
respective
homes
considered
the
trumpet
as
sounded
and
began
to
gird
themselves
for
battle
chapter
xx
it
far
from
my
hand
and
intent
to
write
a
history
of
the
tribulations
which
ensued
from
the
day
of
the
uproar
and
first
outbreaking
of
the
wrath
of
the
people
against
the
images
of
the
romish
idolatry
and
therefore
i
shall
proceed
with
all
expedient
brevity
to
relate
what
farther
in
those
sore
times
fell
under
the
eye
of
my
grandfather
who
when
he
returned
to
edinburgh
found
the
lord
james
stuart
on
the
point
of
proceeding
to
the
queen
regent
at
stirling
and
he
went
with
him
thither
on
arriving
at
the
castle
they
found
the
french
soldiery
all
collected
in
the
town
and
her
highness
like
another
fiery
bellona
vowing
to
avenge
the
calamities
that
had
befallen
the
idols
and
images
of
perth
and
summoning
and
envoking
the
nobility
and
every
man
of
substance
she
could
think
of
to
come
with
their
vassals
that
she
might
be
enabled
to
chastise
such
sacrilegious
rebellion
the
lord
james
stuart
seeing
her
so
bent
on
extremities
and
knowing
by
his
secret
intelligences
that
strong
powers
were
ready
to
start
forward
at
a
moment
warning
both
in
the
west
and
in
fife
angus
and
merns
entreated
her
to
listen
to
more
moderate
councils
than
those
of
revenge
and
resentment
and
rather
to
think
of
pacification
than
of
punishment
but
she
was
fiery
with
passion
and
a
blinded
instrument
in
the
hands
of
providence
to
work
out
the
deliverance
of
the
land
even
by
the
crooked
policy
that
her
papistical
counsellors
hurried
her
into
so
that
the
lord
james
seeing
she
was
transported
beyond
reason
sent
my
grandfather
and
other
secret
emissaries
to
warn
the
lords
and
leaders
of
the
congregation
and
to
tell
them
that
her
highness
was
minded
to
surprise
perth
as
soon
as
she
had
gathered
a
sufficient
array
the
conduct
of
that
great
worthy
was
in
this
full
of
wisdom
and
foresight
and
policy
by
staying
with
the
queen
he
incurred
the
suspicion
of
the
reformed
to
whom
he
was
a
devoted
friend
but
he
gained
a
knowledge
of
the
intents
of
their
enemies
by
which
he
was
enabled
to
turn
aside
the
edge
of
vengeance
when
it
was
meant
to
be
most
deadly
accordingly
reckless
of
the
opinions
of
men
he
went
forward
with
the
queen
army
towards
perth
but
before
they
had
crossed
the
water
of
earn
word
was
brought
to
her
highness
that
the
earl
of
glencairn
at
the
head
of
two
thousand
five
hundred
of
the
reformed
was
advancing
from
the
shire
of
ayr
such
were
the
fruits
of
my
grandfather
mission
to
the
lord
boyd
and
he
heard
likewise
that
the
bold
and
free
lairds
of
angus
and
merns
with
all
their
followers
had
formed
themselves
in
to
defend
the
town
still
however
her
highness
was
resolute
to
go
on
for
she
was
instigated
by
her
feminine
anger
even
as
much
as
by
the
wicked
councils
of
the
papist
lords
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
but
when
she
reached
the
heights
that
overlooked
the
sweet
valley
of
the
tay
whose
green
and
gentle
bosom
was
then
sparkling
with
the
glances
of
warlike
steel
her
heart
was
softened
and
she
called
to
her
the
lord
james
stuart
and
the
young
earl
of
argyle
the
old
lord
his
father
had
died
some
time
prior
and
sent
them
to
the
army
of
the
congregation
that
peace
might
still
be
preserved
they
accordingly
went
into
the
town
and
sending
notice
to
the
leaders
of
the
reformed
to
appoint
two
of
their
party
to
confer
with
them
john
knox
and
the
master
willocks
were
nominated
my
grandfather
who
attended
the
lord
james
on
this
occasion
was
directed
by
him
to
receive
the
two
deputies
at
the
door
and
to
conduct
them
in
and
when
they
came
he
was
much
troubled
to
observe
the
state
of
their
minds
for
master
willocks
was
austere
in
his
looks
as
if
resolved
on
quarrel
and
the
reformer
was
agitated
and
angry
muttering
to
himself
as
he
ascended
the
stairs
making
his
staff
often
dirl
on
the
steps
no
sooner
were
they
shown
into
the
presence
of
the
two
lords
even
before
the
door
was
shut
than
john
knox
began
to
upbraid
the
lord
james
for
having
broken
the
covenant
and
forsaken
the
congregation
much
to
that
effect
my
grandfather
afterwards
learnt
passed
but
the
lord
james
pacified
him
with
the
assurance
that
his
heart
and
spirit
were
still
true
to
the
cause
and
that
he
had
come
with
argyle
to
prevent
if
possible
the
shedding
of
blood
he
likewise
declared
both
for
himself
and
the
earl
who
had
hitherto
always
abided
by
the
queen
that
if
she
refused
to
listen
to
reasonable
terms
or
should
break
any
treaty
entered
into
they
would
openly
take
part
against
her
upon
these
assurances
a
treaty
was
concluded
by
which
it
was
agreed
that
both
armies
should
retire
peaceably
to
their
respective
habitations
that
the
town
should
be
made
accessible
to
the
queen
regent
that
no
molestation
should
be
given
to
those
who
were
then
in
arms
for
the
congregation
and
no
persecutions
undertaken
against
the
reformed
with
other
covenants
calculated
to
soothe
the
congregation
and
allay
men
fears
but
no
sooner
was
this
treaty
ratified
the
army
of
the
congregation
dispersed
and
her
highness
in
possession
of
the
town
than
it
was
manifest
no
vows
nor
obligations
were
binding
towards
the
heretics
as
the
reformed
were
called
the
queen
french
guards
even
when
attending
her
into
the
town
fired
into
the
house
of
a
known
zealous
protestant
and
killed
his
son
the
inhabitants
were
plundered
and
insulted
with
impunity
and
the
magistrates
were
dismissed
to
make
way
for
men
devoted
to
papistry
the
earl
of
argyle
and
lord
james
stuart
filled
with
wrath
and
indignation
at
such
open
perfidy
went
straight
into
her
presence
without
asking
audience
and
reproached
her
with
deceit
and
craftiness
and
having
so
vented
their
minds
instanter
quitted
the
court
and
the
town
and
attended
by
my
grandfather
and
a
few
other
servants
departed
for
fife
to
which
john
knox
had
also
retired
after
the
dispersion
of
the
congregation
at
perth
the
lord
james
in
virtue
of
being
prior
of
st
andrews
went
thither
attended
by
the
earl
and
sent
my
grandfather
to
crail
where
the
reformer
was
then
preaching
to
invite
him
to
meet
them
and
others
of
the
congregation
with
all
convenient
expedition
my
grandfather
never
having
been
before
in
crail
and
not
knowing
how
the
people
there
might
stand
affected
instead
of
inquiring
for
john
knox
bethought
himself
of
his
acquaintance
with
bailie
kilspinnie
and
so
speired
his
way
to
his
dwelling
little
hoping
from
the
fearful
nature
of
that
honest
man
he
would
find
him
within
but
contrary
to
his
expectation
he
was
not
only
there
but
he
welcomed
my
grandfather
as
an
old
and
very
cordial
friend
leading
him
into
his
house
and
making
much
of
him
telling
him
with
a
voice
of
cheerfulness
that
the
day
of
reckoning
had
at
last
overtaken
the
lascivious
idolaters
then
he
caused
to
be
brought
in
before
my
grandfather
the
five
pretty
babies
that
his
wife
had
abandoned
for
her
papistical
paramour
the
eldest
of
whom
was
but
turned
of
nine
years
the
thoughts
of
their
mother
shame
overcame
their
father
at
that
moment
and
the
tears
coming
into
his
eyes
he
sobbed
aloud
as
he
looked
at
them
and
wept
bitterly
while
they
flocked
around
and
wreathed
him
as
it
were
with
their
caresses
and
innocent
blandishments
so
tender
a
scene
melted
my
grandfather
spirit
into
sadness
and
he
could
not
remain
master
of
himself
when
the
eldest
a
mild
and
meek
little
maiden
said
to
him
as
if
to
excuse
her
father
sorrow
a
foul
friar
made
my
mother
an
and
took
her
away
ae
night
when
she
was
just
done
harkening
our
prayers
at
this
juncture
a
blooming
and
damsel
came
into
the
room
but
seeing
a
stranger
she
drew
back
and
was
going
away
when
the
bailie
drying
his
eyes
said
come
ben
elspa
this
is
the
young
man
that
ye
hae
heard
me
sae
commend
for
his
kind
friendship
to
me
in
that
that
i
made
in
my
distraction
to
st
andrews
this
he
added
turning
to
my
grandfather
is
elspa
ruet
the
sister
of
that
misfortunate
woman
to
my
helpless
bairns
she
does
their
mother
duty
elspa
made
a
gentle
beck
as
her
was
speaking
and
turning
round
dropt
a
tear
on
the
neck
of
the
youngest
baby
as
she
leant
down
to
take
it
up
for
a
screen
to
hide
her
blushing
face
that
reddent
with
the
thought
at
seeing
one
who
had
so
witnessed
her
shame
from
that
hour
her
image
had
a
dear
place
in
my
grandfather
bosom
and
after
the
settlement
of
the
reformation
throughout
the
realm
he
courted
her
and
she
became
his
wife
and
in
process
of
time
my
grandmother
but
of
her
manifold
excellencies
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
more
at
large
hereafter
for
she
was
no
ordinary
woman
but
a
saint
throughout
life
returning
in
a
good
old
age
to
her
maker
almost
as
blameless
as
she
came
from
his
pure
hands
and
nothing
became
her
more
in
all
her
piety
than
the
part
she
acted
towards
her
guilty
sister
having
taken
away
the
children
she
then
brought
in
divers
refreshments
and
a
flagon
of
posset
but
she
remained
not
with
the
bailie
and
my
grandfather
while
they
partook
thereof
so
that
they
were
left
free
to
converse
as
they
listed
and
my
grandfather
was
glad
to
find
as
i
have
already
said
that
the
poor
man
had
triumphed
over
his
fond
grief
and
was
reconciled
to
his
misfortunes
as
well
as
any
father
could
well
be
with
so
many
deserted
babies
and
three
of
them
daughters
he
likewise
learnt
with
no
less
solace
and
satisfaction
that
the
reformed
were
strong
in
crail
and
that
the
magistrates
and
beinest
burgesses
had
been
present
on
the
day
before
at
the
preaching
of
john
knox
and
had
afterwards
suffered
the
people
to
demolish
the
images
and
all
the
monuments
of
papistry
without
molestation
or
hinderance
so
that
the
town
was
cleansed
of
the
pollution
of
idolatry
and
the
worship
of
humble
and
contrite
hearts
established
there
instead
of
the
pagan
pageantry
of
masses
and
altars
after
the
repast
was
finished
the
bailie
conducted
my
grandfather
to
the
house
where
john
knox
then
lodged
to
whom
he
communicated
his
message
from
the
lord
james
stuart
tell
your
master
was
the
reply
of
the
reformer
that
i
will
be
with
him
god
willing
and
god
is
willing
for
this
invitation
and
the
state
of
men
minds
maketh
his
will
manifest
yea
i
was
minded
myself
to
go
thither
for
that
same
city
of
st
andrews
is
the
zion
of
scotland
of
old
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
were
first
heard
there
there
amidst
the
damps
and
the
darkness
of
ages
the
ancient
culdees
men
whose
memory
is
still
fragrant
for
piety
and
purity
of
faith
and
life
supplied
the
oil
of
the
lamp
of
the
living
god
for
a
period
of
four
hundred
years
independent
of
pope
prelate
or
any
human
supremacy
there
it
was
that
a
spark
of
their
blessed
embers
was
in
our
own
day
first
blown
into
a
flame
and
there
please
god
where
i
his
unworthy
instrument
was
condemned
as
a
criminal
for
his
truth
sake
shall
i
in
his
strength
be
the
herald
of
his
triumph
and
great
victory
chapter
xxi
when
my
grandfather
had
returned
to
the
bailie
house
after
delivering
his
message
to
the
reformer
he
spent
an
evening
of
douce
but
pleasant
pastime
with
him
and
the
modest
elspa
ruet
whose
conversation
was
far
above
her
degree
and
seasoned
with
the
sweet
savour
of
holiness
but
ever
and
anon
though
all
parties
strove
to
eschew
the
subject
they
began
to
speak
of
her
erring
sister
the
bailie
compassionating
her
continuance
in
sin
as
a
man
and
a
christian
should
but
showing
no
wish
nor
will
to
mind
her
any
more
as
kith
or
kin
to
him
or
his
a
temper
that
my
grandfather
was
well
content
to
observe
he
had
attained
not
so
was
that
of
elspa
but
her
words
were
few
and
well
chosen
and
they
made
a
deep
impression
on
my
grandfather
for
she
seemed
fain
to
hide
what
was
passing
in
her
heart
twice
or
thrice
she
spoke
of
the
ties
of
nature
intimating
that
they
were
as
a
bond
and
obligation
laid
on
by
the
maker
whereby
kindred
were
bound
to
stand
by
one
another
in
weal
or
in
woe
lest
those
who
sinned
should
be
utterly
abandoned
by
all
the
world
the
which
tender
and
christian
sentiment
though
it
was
melodious
to
my
grandfather
spirit
pierced
it
with
a
keen
pain
for
he
thought
of
the
manner
in
which
he
had
left
his
own
parents
even
though
it
was
for
the
blessed
sake
of
religion
and
his
bosom
was
at
the
moment
filled
with
sorrow
but
when
he
said
how
much
he
regretted
and
was
yet
unrepentant
of
that
step
elspa
cheered
him
with
a
consolation
past
utterance
by
reminding
him
that
he
had
neither
left
them
to
want
nor
to
sin
that
by
quitting
the
shelter
of
their
wing
he
had
but
obeyed
the
promptings
of
nature
and
that
if
at
any
time
hereafter
father
or
mother
stood
in
need
of
his
aid
or
exhortation
he
could
still
do
his
duty
without
well
considering
what
he
said
the
bailie
observed
on
this
that
he
was
surprised
to
hear
her
say
so
and
yet
allow
her
sister
to
remain
so
long
unreproved
in
her
offences
elspa
ruet
to
this
made
no
immediate
reply
she
was
indeed
unable
and
my
grandfather
sympathised
with
her
for
the
sting
had
plainly
penetrated
to
the
very
marrow
of
her
soul
at
last
however
she
said
your
reproach
is
just
i
hae
been
to
blame
baith
to
heaven
and
man
but
the
thing
has
na
been
unthought
only
i
kent
na
how
to
gang
about
the
task
and
yet
what
gars
me
say
sae
but
a
woman
weakness
for
the
road
no
sae
lang
to
st
andrews
and
surely
iniquity
does
not
there
so
abound
that
no
ane
would
help
me
to
the
donsie
woman
bower
my
grandfather
on
hearing
this
answered
that
if
she
was
indeed
minded
to
try
to
rescue
her
sister
he
was
ready
and
willing
to
do
all
with
her
and
for
her
that
she
could
desire
but
bearing
in
mind
the
light
woman
open
shame
he
added
i
fearful
it
yet
owre
soon
to
hope
for
her
amendment
she
hae
to
fin
the
evil
upshot
of
her
ungodly
courses
i
doubt
before
she
be
wrought
into
a
frame
of
sincere
penitence
nevertheless
replied
elspa
ruet
i
will
try
it
my
duty
and
my
sisterly
love
bids
me
no
to
be
slothful
in
the
task
at
which
words
she
burst
into
sore
and
sorrowful
weeping
saying
alas
alas
that
she
should
have
so
fallen
i
loved
her
oh
naebody
can
tell
how
dearly
even
as
i
loved
myself
when
i
first
saw
my
ain
face
in
a
i
thought
it
was
her
and
kissed
it
for
the
likeness
in
pity
that
it
didna
look
sae
fair
as
it
was
wont
to
be
but
it
the
lord
pleasure
and
in
permitting
her
to
sink
so
low
he
has
no
doubt
some
lesson
to
teach
thus
from
less
to
more
as
they
continued
conversing
it
was
agreed
that
elspa
ruet
should
ride
on
a
pad
ahint
my
grandfather
next
morning
to
st
andrews
in
order
to
try
if
the
thing
could
be
to
move
her
sister
to
the
humiliation
of
contrition
for
her
loose
life
and
some
small
preparations
being
needful
elspa
departed
and
left
the
bailie
and
my
grandfather
together
but
said
my
grandfather
to
him
after
she
had
been
some
time
away
your
design
to
take
the
unfortunate
woman
back
among
your
innocent
lassie
bairns
no
replied
the
bailie
that
no
a
thing
to
be
now
thought
of
please
providence
she
again
darken
my
door
i
no
however
allow
her
to
want
her
mother
poor
auld
afflicted
woman
that
has
refraint
from
greeting
since
her
flight
she
tak
her
in
but
atween
her
and
me
there
a
divorce
for
ever
by
daylight
my
grandfather
had
his
horse
at
the
door
and
elspa
having
borrowed
the
provost
lady
pad
overnight
it
was
buckled
on
and
they
were
soon
after
on
the
road
it
was
a
sunny
morning
in
june
and
all
things
were
bright
and
blithe
and
blooming
the
spirits
of
youth
joy
and
enjoyment
were
spread
about
on
the
earth
the
butterflies
like
floating
lilies
sailed
from
blossom
to
blossom
and
the
gowans
the
bright
and
beautiful
eyes
of
the
summer
shone
with
gladness
as
nature
walked
on
bank
and
brae
in
maiden
pride
spreading
and
showing
her
new
flowery
mantle
to
the
sun
the
very
airs
that
stirred
the
glittering
trees
were
soft
and
genial
as
the
breath
of
life
and
the
leaves
of
the
aspine
seemed
to
lap
the
sunshine
like
the
tongues
of
young
and
happy
creatures
that
delight
in
their
food
as
my
grandfather
and
elspa
ruet
rode
along
together
they
partook
of
the
universal
benignity
with
which
all
things
seemed
that
morning
so
graciously
adorned
and
their
hearts
were
filled
with
the
hope
that
their
united
endeavours
to
save
her
fallen
sister
would
be
blessed
with
success
but
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
papal
towers
and
gorgeous
edifices
of
st
andrews
which
then
raised
their
proud
heads
like
babel
so
audaciously
to
the
heavens
they
both
became
silent
my
grandfather
thoughts
ran
on
what
might
ensue
if
the
archbishop
were
to
subject
him
to
his
dominion
and
he
resolved
as
early
as
possible
to
make
known
his
arrival
to
the
lord
james
stuart
who
in
virtue
of
being
head
of
the
priory
was
then
resident
there
and
to
claim
his
protection
accordingly
he
determined
to
ride
with
elspa
ruet
to
the
house
of
the
vintner
in
the
shoegate
of
which
i
have
already
spoken
and
to
leave
her
under
the
care
of
lucky
kilfauns
as
the
hostess
was
called
until
he
had
done
so
but
fears
and
sorrows
were
busy
with
the
fancy
of
his
fair
companion
and
it
was
to
her
a
bitter
thing
as
she
afterwards
told
him
to
think
that
the
purpose
of
her
errand
was
to
entreat
a
beloved
sister
to
leave
a
life
of
shame
and
sin
and
sadly
doubting
if
she
would
succeed
being
thus
occupied
with
their
respective
cogitations
they
entered
the
city
in
silence
and
reached
the
vintner
door
without
having
exchanged
a
word
for
several
miles
there
elspa
alighted
and
being
commended
to
the
care
of
lucky
kilfauns
who
though
of
a
free
outspoken
nature
was
a
most
creditable
matron
my
grandfather
left
her
and
rode
up
the
gait
to
the
priory
yett
where
on
his
arrival
he
made
himself
known
to
the
porter
and
was
admitted
to
the
lord
prior
as
the
lord
james
was
there
papistically
called
having
told
his
lordship
that
he
had
delivered
his
message
to
john
knox
and
that
the
reformer
would
not
fail
to
attend
the
call
he
then
related
partly
what
had
happened
to
himself
in
his
former
sojourn
at
st
andrews
and
how
and
for
what
end
he
had
brought
elspa
ruet
there
that
day
with
him
entreating
the
lord
james
to
give
him
his
livery
and
protection
for
fear
of
the
archbishop
which
with
many
pleasing
comments
on
his
devout
and
prudent
demeanour
that
noble
worthy
most
readily
vouchsafed
and
my
grandfather
returned
to
the
vintner
chapter
xxii
when
my
grandfather
had
returned
to
the
vintner
he
found
that
elspa
had
conferred
with
lucky
kilfauns
concerning
the
afflicting
end
and
intent
of
her
journey
to
st
andrews
and
that
decent
woman
sympathising
with
her
sorrow
telling
her
of
many
woful
things
of
the
same
sort
she
had
herself
known
and
how
a
cousin
of
her
mother
by
the
side
had
been
wiled
away
from
her
home
by
the
abbot
of
melrose
and
never
heard
tell
of
for
many
a
day
till
she
was
discovered
in
the
condition
of
a
disconsolate
nun
in
a
convent
far
away
in
nithsdale
but
the
great
difficulty
was
to
get
access
to
marion
ruet
bower
for
so
from
that
day
was
mrs
kilspinnie
called
again
by
her
sister
and
after
no
little
communing
it
was
proposed
by
lucky
kilfauns
that
elspa
should
go
with
her
to
the
house
of
a
certain
widow
dingwall
and
there
for
a
time
take
up
her
abode
and
that
my
grandfather
after
putting
on
the
prior
livery
should
look
about
him
for
the
gilly
his
former
guide
and
through
him
make
a
tryst
to
meet
the
dissolute
madam
at
the
widow
house
accordingly
the
matter
was
so
settled
and
while
lucky
kilfauns
in
a
most
motherly
and
pitiful
manner
carried
elspa
ruet
to
the
house
of
the
widow
dingwall
my
grandfather
went
back
to
the
priory
to
get
the
cloak
and
arms
of
the
lord
james
livery
when
he
was
equipped
he
then
went
fearless
all
about
the
town
and
met
with
no
molestation
only
he
saw
at
times
divers
of
the
men
who
recollected
him
and
who
as
he
passed
stopped
and
looked
after
him
and
whispered
to
one
another
and
muttered
fierce
words
much
he
desired
to
fall
in
with
that
humane
samaritan
leonard
meldrum
the
seneschal
of
the
castle
and
fain
would
he
have
gone
thither
to
inquire
for
him
but
until
he
had
served
the
turn
of
the
mournful
elspa
ruet
he
would
not
allow
any
wish
of
his
own
to
lead
him
to
aught
wherein
there
was
the
hazard
of
any
trouble
that
might
balk
her
pious
purpose
after
daunering
from
place
to
place
and
seeing
nothing
of
the
stripling
he
was
obligated
to
give
twalpennies
to
a
stabler
lad
to
search
for
him
who
soon
brought
him
to
the
vintner
where
my
grandfather
putting
on
the
look
of
a
losel
and
roister
gave
him
a
groat
and
bade
him
go
to
the
madam
dwelling
and
tell
her
that
he
would
be
from
the
gloaming
all
the
night
at
the
widow
dingwall
where
he
would
rejoice
exceedingly
if
she
could
come
and
spend
an
hour
or
two
the
stripling
so
fee
was
right
glad
and
made
himself
so
familiar
towards
my
grandfather
that
lucky
kilfauns
observing
it
the
better
to
conceal
their
plot
feigned
to
be
most
obstreperous
flyting
at
him
with
all
her
pith
and
bir
and
chiding
my
grandfather
as
being
as
scant
grace
as
a
gaberlunzie
or
a
novice
of
the
dominicans
however
they
worked
so
well
together
that
the
gilly
never
misdoubted
either
her
or
my
grandfather
and
took
the
errand
to
his
mistress
from
whom
he
soon
came
with
a
light
foot
and
a
glaikit
eye
saying
she
would
na
fail
to
keep
the
tryst
that
this
new
proof
of
the
progress
she
was
making
in
guilt
and
sin
might
be
the
more
tenderly
broken
to
her
chaste
and
gentle
sister
lucky
kilfauns
herself
undertook
to
tell
elspa
what
had
been
covenanted
to
prepare
her
for
the
meeting
my
grandfather
would
fain
have
had
a
milder
mediatrix
for
the
vintner
worthy
wife
was
wroth
against
the
concubine
calling
her
offence
redder
than
the
crimson
of
schism
and
blacker
than
the
broth
of
the
burning
brimstone
of
heresy
with
many
other
vehement
terms
of
indignation
none
worse
than
the
wicked
woman
deserved
though
harsh
to
be
heard
by
a
sister
that
grieved
for
her
unregenerate
condition
far
more
than
if
she
had
come
from
crail
to
st
andrews
only
to
lay
her
head
in
the
coffin
the
paction
between
all
parties
being
thus
covenanted
and
lucky
kilfauns
gone
to
prepare
the
fortitude
of
elspa
ruet
for
the
trial
it
was
to
undergo
my
grandfather
walked
out
alone
to
pass
the
time
till
the
trysted
hour
it
was
then
late
in
the
afternoon
and
as
he
sauntered
along
he
could
not
but
observe
that
something
was
busy
with
the
minds
and
imaginations
of
the
people
knots
of
the
douce
and
elderly
shopkeepers
were
seen
standing
in
the
streets
with
their
heads
laid
together
and
as
he
walked
towards
the
priory
he
met
the
provost
between
two
of
the
bailies
with
the
dean
of
guild
coming
sedately
and
with
very
great
solemnity
in
their
countenances
down
the
crown
of
the
causey
heavily
laden
with
magisterial
fears
he
stopped
to
look
at
them
and
he
remarked
that
they
said
little
to
one
another
but
what
they
did
say
seemed
to
be
words
of
weight
and
when
any
of
their
friends
and
acquaintances
happened
to
pass
they
gave
them
a
nod
that
betokened
much
sadness
of
heart
the
cause
of
all
this
anxiety
was
not
in
its
effects
and
influence
meted
only
to
the
men
and
magistrates
the
women
partook
of
them
even
to
a
greater
degree
they
were
seen
passing
from
house
to
house
out
at
one
door
and
into
the
next
and
their
faces
were
full
of
strange
matters
one
in
particular
whom
my
grandfather
noticed
coming
along
was
often
addressed
with
brief
questions
and
her
responses
were
seemingly
as
awful
as
an
oracle
she
was
an
aged
carlin
who
in
her
day
had
been
a
midwife
but
having
in
course
of
time
waxed
old
and
being
then
somewhat
slackened
in
the
joints
of
the
right
side
by
a
paralytic
she
eked
out
the
weakly
remainder
of
her
thread
of
life
in
visitations
among
the
families
that
in
her
abler
years
she
had
assisted
to
increase
and
multiply
she
was
then
returning
home
after
spending
the
day
as
my
grandfather
afterwards
heard
from
the
widow
dingwall
with
the
daughter
at
whose
birth
she
had
been
the
howdy
and
who
being
married
some
months
had
sent
to
consult
her
anent
a
occasion
as
she
came
toddling
along
with
steps
in
a
rose
satin
mantle
that
she
got
as
a
blithemeat
gift
when
she
helped
the
young
master
of
elcho
into
the
world
drawn
close
over
her
head
and
leaning
on
a
staff
with
her
right
hand
while
in
her
left
she
carried
a
flanders
pig
of
strong
ale
with
a
clout
the
mouth
to
keep
it
from
jawping
scarcely
a
door
or
entry
mouth
was
she
allowed
to
pass
but
she
was
obligated
to
stop
and
speak
and
what
she
said
appeared
to
be
tidings
of
no
comfort
all
these
things
bred
wonder
and
curiosity
in
the
breast
of
my
grandfather
who
not
being
acquaint
with
any
body
that
he
saw
did
not
like
for
some
time
to
inquire
but
at
last
his
diffidence
and
modesty
were
overcome
by
the
appearance
of
a
strong
party
of
the
armed
retainers
followed
by
a
mob
of
bairns
and
striplings
yelling
and
scoffing
at
them
with
bitter
taunts
and
many
titles
of
derision
and
on
inquiring
at
a
laddie
what
had
caused
the
consternation
in
the
town
and
the
passage
of
so
many
soldiers
from
the
castle
he
was
told
that
they
expected
john
knox
the
day
following
and
that
he
was
mindet
to
preach
but
the
archbishop
has
resolved
no
to
let
him
it
was
even
so
for
the
lord
james
stuart
who
possessed
a
deep
and
forecasting
spirit
had
soon
after
my
grandfather
arrival
with
the
reformer
answer
made
the
news
known
to
try
the
temper
of
the
inhabitants
and
burghers
but
saving
this
marvelling
and
preparation
nothing
farther
of
a
public
nature
took
place
that
night
so
that
a
short
time
before
the
hour
appointed
my
grandfather
went
to
the
house
of
widow
dingwall
where
he
found
elspa
ruet
sitting
very
disconsolate
in
a
chamber
by
herself
weeping
bitterly
at
the
woful
account
which
lucky
kilfauns
had
brought
of
her
sister
loose
life
and
fearing
greatly
that
all
her
kind
endeavours
and
humble
prayers
would
be
but
as
water
spilt
on
the
ground
chapter
xxiii
as
the
time
of
appointment
drew
near
elspa
ruet
was
enabled
to
call
in
her
wandering
and
anxious
thoughts
and
strengthened
by
her
duty
the
blessing
of
the
tranquil
mind
was
shed
upon
her
her
tears
were
dried
up
and
her
countenance
shone
with
a
serene
benignity
when
she
was
an
aged
withered
woman
my
grandfather
has
been
heard
to
say
that
he
never
remembered
her
appearance
without
marvelling
at
the
special
effusion
of
holiness
and
beauty
which
beamed
and
brightened
upon
her
in
that
trying
hour
nor
without
thinking
that
he
still
beheld
the
glory
of
its
twilight
glowing
through
the
dark
and
faded
clouds
of
her
old
age
they
had
not
sat
long
when
a
tapping
was
heard
at
the
widow
door
and
my
grandfather
starting
up
retired
into
a
distant
corner
of
the
room
behind
a
big
napery
press
and
sat
down
in
the
obscurity
of
its
shadow
elspa
remained
in
her
seat
beside
the
table
on
which
a
candle
was
burning
and
as
it
stood
behind
the
door
she
could
not
be
seen
by
any
coming
in
till
they
had
passed
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
in
little
more
than
the
course
of
a
minute
the
voice
of
her
sister
was
heard
and
light
footsteps
on
the
timber
stair
the
door
was
then
opened
and
marion
swirled
in
with
an
uncomely
bravery
elspa
started
from
her
seat
the
guilty
and
convicted
creature
uttered
a
shriek
but
in
the
same
moment
her
pious
sister
clasped
her
with
in
her
arms
and
bursting
into
tears
wept
bitterly
with
sore
sobs
for
some
time
on
her
bosom
which
was
wantonly
unkerchiefed
after
a
short
space
of
time
with
confusion
of
face
and
frowns
of
mortification
and
glances
of
rage
the
abandoned
marion
disengaged
herself
from
her
sister
fond
and
sorrowful
embraces
and
retreating
to
a
chair
sat
down
and
seemed
to
muster
all
the
evil
passions
of
the
guilty
breast
fierce
anger
sharp
hatred
and
gnawing
contempt
and
a
bad
boldness
of
look
that
betokened
a
worse
spirit
than
them
all
it
was
na
to
see
the
like
of
you
i
cam
here
said
she
with
a
scornful
toss
of
her
head
i
ken
that
marion
replied
elspa
mournfully
and
what
business
then
hae
ye
to
come
to
snool
me
elspa
for
a
little
while
made
no
answer
to
this
but
drying
her
eyes
she
went
to
her
seat
composedly
and
then
said
ye
my
sister
and
brought
shame
and
disgrace
on
a
your
family
o
marion
i
wae
to
say
this
but
ye
owre
brave
in
your
sin
do

havering
daunering
cuif
o
a
creature
the
crail
bailie
he
a
man
o
mair
worth
and
conduct
marion
replied
her
sister
firmly
than
to
put
that
in
your
power
even
woman
if
ye
were
penitent
and
besought
him
for
charity
weel
weel
no
to
clishmaclaver
about
him
how
a
wi
the
bairns
are
ye
no
frighted
marion
to
speer
sic
a
question
when
ye
think
how
ye
left
them
and
what
for
ye
did
sae
am
na
i
their
mither
have
na
i
a
right
to
speer
no
said
elspa
when
ye
forgot
that
ye
were
their
father
wife
they
lost
their
mother
ye
need
na
be
sae
snell
wi
your
taunts
exclaimed
marion
evidently
endeavouring
to
preserve
the
arrogance
she
had
assumed
ye
need
na
be
sae
snell
i
far
better
off
and
happier
than
i
was
in
james
kilspinnie
aught
that
no
possible
said
her
sister
it
would
be
an
unco
thing
of
heaven
to
let
wickedness
be
happier
than
honesty
but
marion
dinna
deceive
yoursel
ye
hae
nae
sure
footing
on
the
steading
where
ye
stan
the
bishop
will
nae
mair
than
your
guidman
thole
your
loose
life
to
him
if
he
kent
ye
were
here
i
doubt
he
would
let
you
bide
and
what
would
become
of
you
then
he
no
sic
a
fool
as
to
be
angry
that
i
am
wi
my
sister
that
may
be
replied
elspa
i
thinking
however
if
in
my
place
here
he
saw
but
that
young
man
and
she
pointed
to
my
grandfather
whom
her
sister
had
not
till
then
observed
he
would
have
some
cause
to
consider
marion
attempted
to
laugh
scornfully
but
her
heart
gurged
within
her
and
instead
of
laughter
her
voice
broke
out
into
wild
and
horrid
yells
and
falling
back
in
her
chair
she
grew
stiff
and
ghastly
to
behold
in
so
much
that
both
elspa
and
my
grandfather
were
terrified
and
had
to
work
with
her
for
some
time
before
they
were
able
to
recover
her
nor
indeed
did
she
come
rightly
to
herself
till
she
got
relief
by
tears
but
they
were
tears
of
rage
and
not
shed
for
any
remorse
on
account
of
her
foul
fault
indeed
no
sooner
was
she
come
to
herself
than
she
began
to
rail
at
her
sister
and
my
grandfather
calling
them
by
all
the
terms
of
scorn
that
her
tongue
could
vent
at
last
she
said
but
nae
doubt
ye
twa
reformers
ay
replied
elspa
in
a
sense
we
are
sae
for
we
would
fain
help
to
reform
you
but
after
a
long
faithful
and
undaunted
endeavour
on
the
part
of
elspa
in
this
manner
to
reach
the
sore
of
her
sinful
conscience
she
saw
that
all
her
ettling
was
of
no
avail
and
her
heart
sank
and
she
began
to
weep
saying
o
marion
marion
ye
were
my
dear
sister
ance
but
frae
this
night
if
ye
leave
me
to
gang
again
to
your
sins
i
hope
the
lord
will
erase
the
love
i
bear
you
utterly
out
of
my
heart
and
leave
me
but
the
remembrance
of
what
ye
were
when
we
were
twa
wee
playing
lassies
clapping
our
young
hands
and
singing
for
joy
in
the
bonny
spring
mornings
that
will
never
never
come
again
the
guilty
marion
was
touched
with
her
sorrow
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
relent
and
melt
replying
in
a
softened
accent
but
tell
me
eppie
for
ye
hae
na
telt
me
yet
how
did
ye
leave
my
weans
would
you
like
to
see
them
said
elspa
eagerly
i
would
na
like
to
gang
to
crail
replied
her
sister
thoughtfully
but
if
and
she
hesitated
surely
marion
exclaimed
elspa
with
indignation
ye
no
sae
lost
to
all
shame
as
to
wish
your
innocent
dochters
to
see
you
in
the
midst
of
your
iniquities
marion
reddened
and
sat
abashed
and
rebuked
for
a
short
time
in
silence
and
then
reverting
to
her
children
she
said
somewhat
humbly
but
tell
me
how
they
are
poor
things
they
are
as
weel
as
can
be
hoped
for
replied
elspa
moved
by
her
altered
manner
but
they
lang
miss
the
loss
of
their
mother
care
o
marion
how
could
ye
quit
them
the
beasts
that
perish
are
kinder
to
their
young
for
they
nourish
and
protect
them
till
they
can
do
for
themselves
but
your
wee
may
can
neither
yet
gang
nor
speak
she
your
very
picture
marion
as
like
you
as
god
forbid
that
she
ever
be
like
you
the
wretched
mother
was
unable
to
resist
the
energy
of
her
appeal
and
bursting
into
tears
wept
bitterly
for
some
time
elspa
compassionating
her
contrition
rose
and
taking
her
kindly
by
the
hand
said
come
marion
we
gang
hame
let
us
leave
this
guilty
city
let
us
tarry
no
longer
within
its
walls
the
curse
of
heaven
is
darkening
over
it
and
the
storm
of
the
hatred
of
its
corruption
is
beginning
to
lighten
let
us
flee
from
the
wrath
that
is
to
come
i
no
gang
back
to

replied
her
sister
o
marion
if
ye
felt
within
the
humiliation
of
a
true
penitent
ye
would
na
speak
that
way
but
would
come
and
hide
your
face
in
your
poor
mother
bosom
often
often
marion
did
she
warn
you
no
to
be
up
wi
the
pride
an
bravery
of
a
fine
outside

the
impenitent

starting
from

every
one
if

about
that
blethering
bodie
james
kilspinnie

the
price

but
i

glad
if

a
braw
bower
and
let
me
tell
you
this
is
no
a
house
of
the
best
repute

ony
better
replied
elspa
fervently
no
marion
sooner
would
i
enter
the
gates
of
death
than
darken
your
guilty
door
shame
upon
you
shame
but
the
sweet
heavens
in
their
gracious
hour
of
mercy
will
remember
the
hope
that
led
me
here
and
some
day
work
out
a
blessed
change
the
prayers
of
an
afflicted
parent
and
the
cries
of
your
desolate
babies
will
assuredly
bring
down
upon
you
the
purifying
fires
of
though
a
wicked
pride
at
this
time
withholds
you
from
submitting
to
the
humiliation
which
is
the
just
penalty
of
your
offences
still
the
day
is
not
far
off
when
you
will
come
begging
for
a
morsel
of
bread
to
those
that
weep
for
your
fall
and
implore
you
to
eschew
the
evil
of
your
way
to
these
words
which
were
spoken
as
with
the
vehemence
of
prophecy
the
miserable
woman
made
no
answer
but
plucked
her
hand
sharply
from
her
sister
earnest
pressure
and
quitted
the
room
with
a
flash
of
anger
my
grandfather
then
conveyed
the
mournful
elspa
back
to
the
house
of
lucky
kilfauns
and
returned
to
the
priory
chapter
xxiv
the
next
day
elspa
ruet
under
the
escorting
of
my
grandfather
was
minded
to
have
gone
home
to
crail
but
the
news
that
john
knox
was
to
preach
on
the
morrow
at
st
andrews
had
spread
far
and
wide
no
man
could
tell
by
what
wonderful
reverberation
the
tidings
had
awakened
the
whole
land
from
all
quarters
droves
of
the
reformed
and
the
pious
came
pressing
to
the
gates
of
the
city
like
sheep
to
the
fold
and
doves
to
the
windows
the
archbishop
and
the
priests
and
friars
were
smitten
with
dread
and
consternation
the
doom
of
their
fortunes
was
evident
in
the
distraction
of
their
minds
but
the
earl
of
argyle
and
the
lord
james
stuart
at
the
priory
remained
calm
and
collected
foreseeing
that
the
step
they
had
taken
would
soon
be
visited
by
the
wrath
of
the
queen
regent
they
resolved
to
prepare
for
the
worst
and
my
grandfather
was
ordered
to
hold
himself
in
readiness
for
a
journey
thus
was
he
prevented
from
going
to
crail
with
elspa
ruet
who
with
a
heavy
heart
went
back
in
the
evening
with
the
man
and
horses
that
brought
the
reformer
to
the
town
for
john
knox
though
under
the
ban
of
outlawry
was
so
encouraged
with
inward
assurances
from
on
high
that
he
came
openly
to
the
gate
and
passed
up
the
crown
of
the
causey
on
to
the
priory
in
the
presence
of
the
archbishop
guards
of
all
the
people
and
of
the
astonished
and
dismayed
priesthood
as
soon
as
the
antichrist
heard
of
his
arrival
he
gave
orders
for
all
his
armed
retainers
to
the
number
of
more
than
a
hundred
to
assemble
in
the
cloisters
of
the
monastery
of
the
blackfriars
for
he
was
a
man
of
a
soldierly
spirit
and
though
a
loose
and
immoral
churchman
would
have
made
a
valiant
warrior
and
going
thither
himself
he
thence
sent
word
to
the
lord
james
stuart
at
the
priory
that
if
john
knox
dared
to
preach
in
the
cathedral
as
was
threatened
he
would
order
his
guard
to
fire
on
him
in
the
pulpit
my
grandfather
with
others
of
the
retinue
of
the
two
noblemen
had
accompanied
the
archbishop
messenger
into
the
prior
chamber
where
they
were
sitting
with
john
knox
when
this
bold
challenge
to
the
champion
of
christ
cause
was
delivered
and
it
was
plain
that
both
argyle
and
the
lord
james
were
daunted
by
it
for
they
well
knew
the
fearlessness
and
the
fierceness
of
their
consecrated
adversary
after
the
messenger
had
retired
and
the
lord
james
in
a
particular
manner
had
tacitly
signified
to
my
grandfather
to
remain
in
the
room
and
had
taken
a
slip
of
paper
he
began
to
write
thereon
while
argyle
said
to
the
reformer
master
knox
this
is
what
we
could
na
but
expect
and
though
it
may
seem
like
a
misdooting
of
our
cause
now
to
desist
i
in
a
swither
if
ye
should
mak
the
attempt
to
preach
the
reformer
made
no
answer
and
the
lord
james
laying
down
his
pen
also
said
my
thoughts
run
wi
argyle
considering
the
weakness
of
our
train
and
the
archbishop
preparations
with
his
own
regardless
character
i
do
think
we
should
for
a
while
rest
in
our
intent
the
queen
regent
has
come
to
falkland
wi
her
french
force
and
we
are
in
no
condition
to
oppose
their
entrance
into
the
town
besides
your
appearance
in
the
pulpit
may
lead
to
the
sacrifice
of
your
own
most
precious
life
and
the
lives
of
many
others
who
will
no
doubt
stand
forth
in
your
defence
whether
therefore
you
ought
in
such
a
predicament
to
think
of
preaching
is
a
thing
to
be
well
considered
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
exclaimed
john
knox
with
the
voice
of
an
apostle
i
will
preach
god
is
my
witness
that
i
never
preached
in
contempt
of
any
man
nor
would
i
willingly
injure
any
creature
but
i
can
not
delay
my
call
if
i
am
not
hindered
by
violence
as
for
the
fear
of
danger
that
may
come
to
me
let
no
man
be
solicitous
for
my
life
is
in
the
custody
of
him
whose
glory
i
seek
and
threats
will
not
deter
me
from
my
duty
when
heaven
so
offereth
the
occasion
i
desire
neither
the
hand
nor
the
weapon
of
man
to
defend
me
i
only
crave
audience
which
if
it
be
denied
to
me
here
at
this
time
i
must
seek
where
i
may
have
it
the
manner
and
confidence
with
which
this
was
spoken
silenced
and
rebuked
the
two
temporal
noblemen
and
they
offered
no
more
remonstrance
but
submitted
as
servants
to
pave
the
way
for
this
intent
of
his
courageous
piety
accordingly
after
remaining
a
short
time
as
if
in
expectation
to
hear
what
the
earl
of
argyle
might
further
have
to
say
the
lord
james
stuart
took
up
his
pen
again
and
when
he
had
completed
his
writing
he
gave
the
paper
to
my
grandfather
it
was
a
list
of
some
ten
or
twelve
names
saying
make
haste
gilhaize
and
let
these
our
friends
in
angus
know
the
state
of
peril
in
which
we
stand
tell
them
what
has
chanced
how
the
gauntlet
is
thrown
and
that
our
champion
has
taken
it
up
and
is
prepared
for
the
onset
my
grandfather
forthwith
departed
on
his
errand
and
spared
not
the
spur
till
he
had
delivered
his
message
to
every
one
whose
names
were
written
in
the
paper
and
their
souls
were
kindled
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
quickened
in
their
hearts
the
roads
sparkled
with
the
feet
of
summoning
horsemen
and
the
towns
rung
with
the
sound
of
warlike
preparations
on
the
third
day
towards
the
afternoon
my
grandfather
embarked
at
dundee
on
his
return
and
was
landed
at
the
fife
there
were
many
in
the
boat
with
him
and
it
was
remarked
by
some
among
them
that
for
several
days
no
one
had
been
observed
to
smile
and
that
all
men
seemed
in
the
expectation
of
some
great
event
the
weather
being
loun
and
very
sultry
he
travelled
slowly
with
those
who
were
bound
for
st
andrews
conversing
with
them
on
the
troubles
of
the
time
and
the
clouds
that
were
gathering
and
darkening
over
poor
scotland
but
every
one
spoke
from
the
faith
of
his
own
bosom
that
the
terrors
of
the
storm
would
not
be
of
long
duration
so
confident
were
those
unlettered
men
of
the
goodness
of
christ
cause
in
that
epoch
of
tribulation
while
they
were
thus
communing
together
they
came
in
sight
of
the
city
with
its
coronal
of
golden
spires
and
babylonian
pride
of
idolatrous
towers
and
they
halted
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
the
gorgeous
insolence
with
which
antichrist
had
there
built
up
and
invested
the
throne
of
his
blasphemous
usurpation
the
walls
of
jericho
said
one
of
the
travellers
fell
at
the
sound
but
of
ram
horns
and
shall
yon
babel
withstand
the
preaching
of
john
knox
scarcely
had
he
said
the
words
when
the
glory
of
its
magnificence
was
wrapt
with
a
shroud
of
dust
a
dreadful
peal
of
thunder
came
rolling
soon
after
though
not
a
spark
of
vapour
was
seen
in
all
the
ether
of
the
blue
sky
and
the
rumble
of
a
dreadful
destruction
was
then
heard
my
grandfather
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
galloped
on
towards
the
town
the
clouds
rose
thicker
and
filled
the
whole
air
shouts
and
cries
as
he
drew
near
were
mingled
with
the
crash
of
falling
edifices
the
earth
trembled
and
his
horse
stood
still
regardless
of
the
rowels
as
if
it
had
seen
the
angel
of
the
lord
standing
in
his
way
on
all
sides
monks
and
nuns
came
flying
from
the
town
wringing
their
hands
as
if
the
horrors
of
the
last
judgment
had
surprised
them
in
their
sins
the
guards
of
the
archbishop
were
scattered
among
them
like
chaff
in
the
swirl
of
the
wind
then
his
grace
came
himself
on
sir
david
fleet
mare
with
sir
david
and
divers
of
his
household
fast
following
the
wrath
of
heaven
was
behind
them
and
they
rattled
past
my
grandfather
like
the
distempered
phantoms
that
hurry
through
the
dreams
of
dying
men
my
grandfather
horse
at
last
obeyed
the
spur
and
he
rode
on
and
into
the
city
the
gates
of
which
were
deserted
there
he
beheld
on
all
sides
that
the
lord
had
indeed
put
the
besom
of
destruction
into
the
hands
of
the
reformers
and
that
not
one
of
all
the
buildings
which
had
been
polluted
by
the
papistry
no
not
one
had
escaped
the
erasing
fierceness
of
its
ruinous
sweep
the
presence
of
the
magistrates
lent
the
grace
of
authority
to
the
zeal
of
the
people
and
all
things
were
done
in
order
the
idols
were
torn
down
from
the
altars
and
deliberately
broken
by
the
children
with
hammers
into
pieces
there
was
no
speaking
all
was
done
in
silence
the
noise
of
the
falling
churches
the
rending
of
the
shrines
and
the
breaking
of
the
images
were
the
only
sounds
heard
but
for
all
that
the
zeal
of
not
a
few
was
even
in
the
midst
of
their
dread
solemnity
alloyed
with
covetousness
my
grandfather
himself
saw
one
of
the
slip
the
bald
head
in
silver
of
one
of
the
twelve
apostles
into
his
pouch
chapter
xxv
the
triumph
of
the
truth
at
st
andrews
was
followed
by
the
victorious
establishment
from
that
day
thenceforward
of
the
reformation
in
scotland
the
precautions
taken
by
the
deep
forecasting
mind
of
the
lord
james
stuart
through
the
instrumentality
of
my
grandfather
and
others
were
of
inexpressible
benefit
to
the
righteous
cause
it
was
foreseen
that
the
queen
regent
who
had
come
to
falkland
would
be
prompt
to
avenge
the
discomfiture
of
her
sect
the
papists
but
the
zealous
friends
of
the
gospel
seconding
the
resolution
of
the
lords
of
the
congregation
enabled
them
to
set
all
her
power
at
defiance
with
an
attendance
of
few
more
than
a
hundred
horse
and
about
as
many
foot
the
earl
of
argyle
and
the
lord
james
set
out
from
st
andrews
to
frustrate
as
far
as
the
means
they
had
concerted
might
the
wrathful
measures
which
they
well
knew
her
highness
would
take
but
this
small
force
was
by
the
next
morning
increased
to
full
three
thousand
fighting
men
and
so
ardently
did
the
spirit
of
enmity
and
resistance
against
the
papacy
spread
that
the
queen
regent
when
she
came
with
her
french
troops
and
her
scottish
levies
under
the
command
of
the
duke
of
chatelherault
to
cupar
found
that
she
durst
not
encounter
in
battle
the
growing
strength
of
the
congregation
so
she
consented
to
a
truce
and
as
usual
in
her
dissimulating
policy
promised
many
things
which
she
never
intended
to
perform
but
the
protestants
by
this
time
knowing
that
the
papists
never
meant
to
keep
their
pactions
with
them
discovering
the
policy
of
her
highness
silently
moved
onward
they
proceeded
to
perth
and
having
expelled
the
garrison
took
the
town
and
fired
the
abbey
of
scone
but
as
my
grandfather
was
not
with
them
in
those
raids
being
sent
on
the
night
of
the
great
demolition
at
st
andrews
to
apprise
the
earl
of
glencairn
his
patron
of
the
extremities
to
which
matters
had
come
there
it
belongs
not
to
the
scope
of
my
story
to
tell
what
ensued
farther
than
that
from
perth
the
congregation
proceeded
to
stirling
where
they
demolished
the
monasteries
then
they
went
to
lithgow
and
herret
the
nests
of
the
locusts
there
and
proceeding
bravely
on
purging
the
realm
as
they
went
forward
they
arrived
at
edinburgh
and
constrained
the
queen
regent
who
was
before
them
with
her
forces
there
to
pack
up
her
ends
and
her
awls
and
make
what
speed
she
could
with
them
to
dunbar
but
foul
as
the
capital
then
was
and
covered
with
the
leprosy
of
idolatry
they
were
not
long
in
possession
till
they
so
medicated
her
with
the
searching
medicaments
of
the
reformation
that
she
was
soon
scrapit
of
all
the
scurf
and
kell
of
her
abominations
there
was
not
an
idol
or
an
image
within
her
bounds
that
in
less
than
three
days
was
not
beheaded
like
a
traitor
and
trundled
to
the
dogs
even
with
vehemence
as
a
thing
that
could
be
sensible
of
contempt
but
as
all
these
things
are
set
forth
at
large
in
the
chronicles
of
the
kingdom
let
suffice
it
to
say
that
my
grandfather
continued
for
nearly
two
years
after
this
time
a
trusted
emissary
among
the
lords
of
the
congregation
in
their
many
arduous
labours
and
perilous
correspondencies
till
the
earl
of
glencairn
was
appointed
to
see
idolatry
banished
and
extirpated
from
the
west
country
in
which
expedition
his
lordship
being
minded
to
reward
my
services
in
the
cause
of
the
reformation
invited
him
to
be
of
his
force
to
which
my
grandfather
not
jealousing
the
secularities
of
his
patron
intents
joyfully
agreed
hoping
to
see
the
placed
on
the
great
edifice
of
the
reformation
which
all
good
and
pious
men
began
then
to
think
near
completion
having
joined
the
earl
force
at
glasgow
my
grandfather
went
forward
with
it
to
paisley
before
reaching
that
town
however
they
were
met
by
a
numerous
multitude
of
the
people
half
way
between
it
and
the
castle
of
cruikstone
and
at
their
head
my
grandfather
was
blithened
to
see
his
old
friend
the
gentle
monk
dominick
callender
in
a
soldier
garb
and
with
a
ruddy
and
emboldened
countenance
and
by
his
side
with
a
sword
manfully
girded
on
his
thigh
the
worthy
bailie
pollock
whose
nocturnal
revels
at
the
abbey
had
brought
such
dule
to
the
winsome
maggy
napier
for
some
reason
which
my
grandfather
never
well
understood
there
was
more
lenity
shown
to
the
abbey
here
than
usual
but
the
monks
were
rooted
out
the
images
given
over
to
destruction
and
the
old
bones
and
miraculous
crucifixes
were
either
burnt
or
interred
less
damage
however
was
done
to
the
buildings
than
many
expected
partly
through
the
exhortations
of
the
magistrates
who
were
desirous
to
preserve
so
noble
a
building
for
a
protestant
church
but
chiefly
out
of
some
paction
or
covenant
secretly
entered
into
anent
the
distribution
of
the
domains
and
property
wherein
the
house
of
hamilton
was
concerned
the
duke
of
chatelherault
the
head
thereof
notwithstanding
the
papistical
nature
of
his
blood
and
kin
having
some
time
before
gone
over
to
the
cause
of
the
congregation
the
work
of
the
reformation
being
thus
abridged
at
paisley
the
earl
of
glencairn
went
forward
to
kilwinning
where
he
was
less
scrupulous
for
having
himself
obtained
a
grant
of
the
lands
of
the
abbacy
he
was
fain
to
make
a
clean
hand
though
at
the
time
my
grandfather
knew
not
of
this
as
soon
as
the
army
reached
the
town
the
soldiers
went
straight
on
to
the
abbey
and
entering
the
great
church
even
while
the
monks
were
chanting
their
paternosters
they
began
to
show
the
errand
they
had
come
on
dreadful
was
the
yell
that
ensued
when
my
grandfather
going
up
to
the
priest
at
the
high
altar
and
pulling
him
by
the
scarlet
and
fine
linen
of
his
pageantry
bade
him
decamp
and
flung
the
toys
and
trumpery
of
the
mass
after
him
as
he
fled
away
in
fear
this
resolute
act
was
the
signal
for
the
general
demolition
and
it
began
on
all
sides
my
grandfather
giving
a
leap
caught
hold
of
a
fine
effigy
of
the
virgin
mary
by
the
leg
to
pull
it
down
but
it
proved
to
be
the
one
which
james
coom
the
smith
had
mended
for
the
leg
came
off
and
my
grandfather
fell
backwards
and
was
for
a
moment
stunned
by
his
fall
a
band
of
the
monks
who
were
standing
trembling
spectators
made
an
attempt
at
seeing
this
to
raise
a
shout
of
a
miracle
but
my
grandfather
in
the
same
moment
recovering
himself
seized
the
timber
leg
and
flung
it
with
violence
at
them
and
it
happened
to
strike
one
of
the
fattest
of
the
flock
with
such
a
bir
that
it
was
said
the
life
was
driven
out
of
him
this
however
was
not
the
case
for
although
the
monk
was
sorely
hurt
he
lived
many
a
day
after
and
was
obligated
in
his
auld
years
when
he
was
feckless
to
be
carried
from
door
to
door
on
a
begging
his
bread
the
wives
i
have
heard
tell
were
kindly
to
him
for
he
was
a
jocose
carl
but
the
weans
little
respected
his
grey
hairs
and
used
to
jeer
him
as
auld
father
paternoster
for
even
to
the
last
he
adhered
to
his
beads
it
was
thought
however
by
a
certain
pious
protestant
gentlewoman
of
irvine
that
before
his
death
he
got
a
cast
of
grace
for
one
day
when
he
had
been
carried
over
to
beg
in
that
town
she
gave
him
a
luggie
of
kail
ower
het
which
he
stirred
with
the
end
of
the
ebony
crucifix
at
his
girdle
thereby
showing
as
she
said
a
symptom
that
it
held
a
lower
place
in
his
spiritual
affections
than
if
he
had
been
as
sincere
in
his
errors
as
he
let
wot
chapter
xxvi
although
my
grandfather
had
sustained
a
severe
bruise
by
his
fall
he
was
still
enabled
after
he
got
on
his
legs
to
superintend
the
demolishment
of
the
abbey
till
it
was
complete
but
in
the
evening
when
he
took
up
his
quarters
in
the
house
of
theophilus
lugton
with
dominick
callender
who
had
brought
on
a
party
of
the
paisley
reformers
he
was
so
stiff
and
sore
that
he
thought
he
would
be
incompetent
to
go
over
next
day
with
the
force
that
the
earl
missioned
to
herry
the
carmelyte
convent
at
irvine
dominick
callender
had
however
among
other
things
learnt
in
the
abbey
at
paisley
the
salutary
virtues
of
many
herbs
and
how
to
decoct
from
them
their
healing
juices
and
he
instructed
dame
lugton
to
prepare
an
efficacious
medicament
that
not
only
mitigated
the
anguish
of
the
pain
but
so
suppled
the
stiffness
that
my
grandfather
was
up
by
break
of
day
and
ready
for
the
march
a
renewed
man
in
speaking
of
this
he
has
been
heard
to
say
it
was
a
thing
much
to
be
lamented
that
when
the
regular
abolition
of
the
monastries
was
decreed
no
care
was
taken
to
collect
the
curious
knowledges
and
ancient
traditionary
skill
preserved
therein
especially
in
what
pertained
to
the
cure
of
maladies
for
it
was
his
opinion
and
many
were
of
the
same
mind
that
among
the
friars
were
numbers
of
potent
physicians
and
an
art
in
the
preparation
of
salves
and
syrups
that
has
not
been
surpassed
by
the
learning
of
the
colleges
but
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
detain
the
courteous
reader
with
such
irrelevancies
the
change
however
which
has
taken
place
in
the
realm
in
all
things
pertaining
to
life
laws
manners
and
conduct
since
the
extirpation
of
the
roman
idolatry
is
from
the
perfectest
report
so
wonderful
that
the
inhabitants
can
scarcely
be
said
to
be
the
same
race
of
people
and
therefore
i
have
thought
that
such
occasional
ancestral
intimations
might
though
they
proved
neither
edifying
nor
instructive
be
yet
deemed
worthy
of
notation
in
the
brief
spaces
which
they
happen
herein
to
occupy
but
now
returning
from
this
digression
i
will
take
up
again
the
thread
and
clue
of
my
story
the
earl
of
glencairn
after
the
abbey
of
kilwinning
was
sacked
went
and
slept
at
eglinton
castle
then
a
stalwart
square
tower
environed
with
a
wall
and
moat
of
a
rude
and
unknown
antiquity
standing
on
a
gentle
rising
ground
in
the
midst
of
a
bleak
and
moorland
domain
and
his
lordship
having
ordered
my
grandfather
to
come
to
him
betimes
in
the
morning
with
twenty
chosen
men
the
discreetest
of
the
force
for
a
special
service
in
which
he
meant
to
employ
him
he
went
thither
accordingly
taking
with
him
dominick
callender
and
twelve
godly
lads
from
paisley
with
seven
others
whom
he
had
remarked
in
the
march
from
glasgow
as
under
the
manifest
guidance
of
a
sedate
and
pious
temper
when
my
grandfather
with
his
company
arrived
at
the
castle
yett
and
he
was
admitted
to
the
earl
his
patron
his
lordship
said
to
him
more
as
a
friend
than
a
master
i
am
in
the
hope
gilhaize
that
after
this
day
the
toilsome
and
perilous
errands
on
which
to
the
weal
of
scotland
and
the
true
church
you
have
been
so
meritoriously
missioned
ever
since
you
were
retained
in
my
service
will
soon
be
brought
to
an
end
and
that
you
will
enjoy
in
peace
the
reward
you
have
earned
so
well
that
i
am
better
pleased
in
bestowing
it
than
you
can
be
in
the
receiving
but
there
is
yet
one
task
which
i
must
put
upon
you
hard
by
to
this
castle
less
than
a
mile
eastward
stands
a
small
convent
of
nuns
who
have
been
for
time
out
of
mind
under
the
protection
of
the
lord
eglinton
family
and
he
having
got
a
grant
of
the
lands
belonging
to
their
house
is
desirous
that
they
should
be
flitted
in
an
amiable
manner
to
a
certain
street
in
irvine
called
the
kirkgate
where
a
lodging
is
provided
for
them
to
do
this
kindly
i
have
bethought
myself
of
you
for
i
know
not
in
all
my
force
any
one
so
well
qualified
have
you
provided
yourself
with
the
twenty
douce
men
that
i
ordered
you
to
bring
hither
my
grandfather
told
his
lordship
that
he
had
done
as
he
was
ordered
then
resumed
the
earl
take
them
with
you
and
this
mandate
to
the
superior
and
one
of
eglinton
men
to
show
you
the
way
and
when
you
have
conveyed
them
to
their
lodging
come
again
to
me
so
my
grandfather
did
as
he
was
directed
by
the
earl
and
marched
eastward
with
his
men
till
he
came
to
the
convent
which
was
a
humble
and
orderly
house
with
a
small
chapel
and
a
tower
that
in
after
times
when
all
the
other
buildings
were
erased
was
called
the
stane
castle
and
is
known
by
that
name
even
unto
this
day
it
stood
within
a
high
wall
and
a
little
gate
with
a
stone
cross
over
the
same
led
to
the
porch
compassionating
the
simple
and
silly
sisterhood
within
who
by
their
sequestration
from
the
world
were
become
as
innocent
as
birds
in
a
cage
my
grandfather
halted
his
men
at
some
distance
from
the
yett
and
going
forward
rung
the
bell
to
the
sound
of
which
an
aged
woman
answered
who
on
being
told
he
had
brought
a
letter
to
the
superior
gave
him
admittance
and
conducted
him
to
a
little
chamber
on
the
one
side
of
which
was
a
grating
where
the
superior
a
short
corpulent
matron
that
seemed
to
bowl
rather
than
to
walk
as
she
moved
along
soon
made
her
appearance
within
he
told
her
in
a
meek
manner
and
with
some
gentle
prefacing
the
purpose
of
his
visit
and
showed
her
the
earl
mandate
to
all
which
for
some
time
she
made
no
reply
but
she
was
evidently
much
moved
at
last
she
gave
a
wild
skreigh
which
brought
the
rest
of
the
nuns
to
the
number
of
thirteen
all
rushing
into
the
room
then
ensued
a
dreadful
tempest
of
all
feminine
passions
and
griefs
intermingled
with
supplications
to
many
a
saint
but
the
powers
and
prerogatives
of
their
saints
were
abolished
in
scotland
and
they
received
no
aid
though
their
lamentation
as
my
grandfather
used
to
say
could
not
be
recited
without
moving
to
mirth
it
was
yet
so
full
of
maidenly
fears
and
simplicity
at
the
time
to
him
that
it
seemed
most
tender
and
he
was
disturbed
at
the
thought
of
driving
such
fair
and
helpless
creatures
into
the
bad
world
but
it
was
his
duty
so
after
soothing
them
as
well
as
he
could
and
representing
how
unavailing
their
refusal
to
go
would
be
the
superior
composed
her
grief
and
exhorting
the
nuns
to
be
resigned
to
their
cruel
fate
which
she
said
was
not
so
grievous
as
that
which
many
of
the
saints
had
in
their
day
suffered
they
all
became
calm
and
prepared
for
the
removal
my
grandfather
told
them
to
take
with
them
whatsoever
they
best
liked
in
the
house
and
it
was
a
moving
sight
to
see
their
simplicity
therein
one
was
content
with
a
another
took
a
cage
in
which
she
had
a
lintie
some
of
them
patterns
of
embroidery
one
aged
sister
of
a
tall
and
spare
form
brought
away
a
flask
of
which
she
had
herself
distilled
but
saving
the
superior
none
of
them
thought
of
any
of
the
valuables
of
the
chapel
till
my
grandfather
reminded
them
that
they
might
find
the
value
of
silver
and
gold
hereafter
even
in
the
town
of
irvine
there
was
one
young
and
graceful
maiden
among
them
who
seemed
but
little
moved
by
the
event
and
my
grandfather
was
melted
to
sympathy
and
sorrow
by
the
solemn
serenity
of
her
deportment
and
the
little
heed
she
took
of
anything
of
all
the
nuns
she
was
the
only
one
who
appeared
to
have
nothing
to
care
for
and
when
they
were
ready
and
came
forth
to
the
gate
instead
of
joining
in
their
piteous
wailings
as
they
bade
their
peaceful
home
a
long
and
last
farewell
she
walked
forward
alone
no
sooner
however
had
she
passed
the
yett
than
on
seeing
the
armed
company
without
she
stood
still
like
a
statue
and
uttering
a
shrill
cry
fainted
away
and
fell
to
the
ground
every
one
ran
to
her
assistance
but
when
her
face
was
unveiled
to
give
her
air
dominick
callender
who
was
standing
by
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
was
enchanted
by
a
fond
and
strange
enthusiasm
she
was
indeed
no
other
than
the
young
maiden
of
paisley
for
whom
he
had
found
his
monastic
rows
the
heavy
fetters
of
a
bondage
that
made
life
scarcely
worth
possessing
and
when
she
was
recovered
an
interchange
of
great
tenderness
took
place
between
them
at
which
the
superior
of
the
convent
waxed
very
wroth
and
the
other
nuns
were
exceedingly
scandalised
but
magdalene
sauchie
for
so
she
was
called
heeded
them
not
for
on
learning
that
popery
was
put
down
in
the
land
by
law
she
openly
declared
that
she
renounced
her
vows
and
during
the
walk
to
irvine
which
was
jimp
a
mile
she
leant
upon
the
arm
of
her
lover
and
they
were
soon
after
married
dominick
settling
in
that
town
as
a
doctor
of
physic
whereby
he
afterwards
earned
both
gold
and
reputation
but
to
conclude
the
history
of
the
convent
which
my
grandfather
had
in
this
gentle
manner
herret
the
nuns
on
reaching
the
foot
of
the
kirkgate
where
the
countess
of
eglinton
had
provided
a
house
for
them
began
to
weep
anew
with
great
vehemence
fearing
that
their
holy
life
was
at
an
end
and
that
they
would
be
tempted
of
men
to
enter
into
the
temporalities
of
the
married
state
but
the
superior
on
hearing
this
mournful
apprehension
mounted
upon
the
steps
of
the
tolbooth
stair
and
in
the
midst
of
a
great
concourse
of
people
she
lifted
her
hands
on
high
and
exclaimed
as
with
the
voice
of
a
prophetess
fear
not
my
chaste
and
pious
dochters
for
your
sake
and
for
my
sake
i
have
an
assurance
at
this
moment
from
the
virgin
mary
herself
that
the
calamity
of
the
will
never
be
known
in
the
kirkgate
of
irvine
but
that
all
maidens
who
hereafter
may
enter
or
be
born
to
dwell
therein
shall
live
a
life
of
single
blessedness
unasked
and
untempted
of
men
which
delightful
prediction
the
nuns
were
so
happy
to
hear
that
they
dried
their
tears
and
chanted
their
ave
maria
joyfully
proceeding
towards
their
appointed
habitation
it
stood
as
i
have
been
told
on
the
same
spot
where
king
james
the
sixth
school
was
afterwards
erected
and
endowed
out
of
the
spoils
of
carmelytes
monastery
which
on
the
same
day
was
by
another
division
of
the
earl
of
power
sacked
and
burnt
to
the
ground
chapter
xxvii
when
my
grandfather
had
in
the
manner
rehearsed
disposed
of
those
sisters
of
simplicity
in
the
kirkgate
of
irvine
he
returned
back
in
the
afternoon
to
the
earl
of
glencairn
at
eglinton
castle
to
report
what
he
had
done
and
his
lordship
again
in
a
most
laudatory
manner
commended
his
prudence
and
singular
mildness
of
nature
mentioning
to
the
earl
and
countess
of
eglinton
then
present
with
him
divers
of
the
missions
wherein
he
had
been
employed
extolling
his
zeal
and
above
all
his
piety
and
the
lady
eglinton
who
was
a
household
character
striving
with
great
frugality
to
augment
the
substance
of
her
lord
by
keeping
her
maidens
from
morning
to
night
eydent
at
work
some
at
their
broidering
drums
and
some
at
their
distaffs
managing
all
within
the
castle
that
pertained
to
her
feminine
part
in
a
way
most
exemplary
to
the
ladies
of
her
time
and
degree
indeed
to
ladies
of
all
times
and
degrees
promised
my
grandfather
that
when
he
was
married
she
would
give
his
wife
something
to
help
the
plenishing
of
their
house
for
the
meek
manner
in
which
he
had
comported
himself
toward
her
friend
the
superior
of
the
nuns
then
the
earl
of
glencairn
said
gilhaize
madam
is
now
his
own
master
and
may
choose
a
bride
when
it
pleases
himself
for
i
have
covenanted
with
my
friend
your
lord
to
let
him
have
the
mailing
of
quharist
in
excambio
for
certain
of
the
lands
of
late
pertaining
to
the
abbacy
of
kilwinning
the
which
lie
more
within
the
vicinage
of
this
castle
and
gilhaize
here
is
my
warrant
to
take
possession
with
which
words
the
earl
rose
and
presented
him
with
a
charter
for
the
lands
signed
by
eglinton
and
himself
and
he
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
saying
that
few
in
all
the
kingdom
had
better
earned
the
guerdon
of
their
service
than
he
had
done
thus
it
was
that
our
family
came
to
be
settled
in
the
shire
of
ayr
for
after
my
grandfather
had
taken
possession
of
his
fee
and
mindful
of
the
vow
he
had
made
in
the
street
of
edinburgh
on
that
blessed
morning
when
john
knox
the
champion
of
the
true
church
arrived
from
geneva
he
went
into
the
east
country
to
espouse
elspa
ruet
if
he
found
her
thereunto
inclined
which
happily
he
soon
did
for
their
spirits
were
in
unison
and
from
the
time
they
first
met
they
had
felt
toward
one
another
as
if
they
had
been
acquaint
in
before
which
made
him
sometimes
say
that
it
was
to
him
a
proof
and
testimony
that
the
souls
of
mankind
have
perhaps
a
living
knowledge
of
each
other
before
they
are
born
into
this
world
at
their
marriage
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
take
with
them
into
the
west
agnes
kilspinnie
one
of
the
misfortunate
bailie
daughters
as
for
her
mother
from
the
day
of
the
overthrow
and
destruction
of
the
papistry
at
st
andrews
she
had
never
been
heard
of
all
the
tidings
her
sister
could
gather
concerning
her
were
that
the
same
night
she
had
been
conveyed
away
by
some
of
the
archbishop
servants
but
whither
no
one
could
tell
so
they
came
with
agnes
kilspinnie
to
edinburgh
and
for
a
ploy
to
their
sober
wedding
they
resolved
to
abide
there
till
the
coming
of
queen
mary
from
france
that
they
might
partake
of
the
shows
and
pastimes
then
preparing
for
her
reception
they
however
during
the
season
of
their
sojourn
feasted
far
better
than
on
royal
fare
in
the
gospel
banquet
of
john
knox
sermons
of
which
they
enjoyed
the
inexpressible
beatitude
three
several
before
the
queen
arrived
of
the
joyous
preparations
to
greet
queen
mary
withal
neither
my
grandfather
nor
grandmother
were
ever
wont
to
discourse
much
at
large
for
they
were
persons
little
esteeming
the
pageantries
of
this
world
but
my
aunt
for
agnes
kilspinnie
being
in
progress
of
time
married
to
my
father
fourth
brother
became
sib
to
me
in
that
degree
was
wont
to
descant
and
enlarge
on
the
theme
with
much
wonderment
and
loquacity
describing
the
marvellous
fabrics
that
were
to
have
been
hung
with
tapestry
to
hold
the
ladies
and
the
fountains
that
were
to
have
spouted
wine
which
nobody
was
to
be
allowed
to
taste
the
same
being
only
for
an
ostentation
in
order
that
the
fact
thereof
might
be
recorded
in
the
chronicles
for
and
great
things
have
i
likewise
heard
her
tell
of
the
paraphernalia
which
the
magistrates
and
were
getting
ready
no
sleep
in
a
sense
she
used
to
say
did
maccalzean
of
cliftonhall
who
was
then
provost
get
for
more
than
a
fortnight
from
night
to
morning
the
sagacious
bailies
sat
in
council
exercising
their
sagacity
to
contrive
devices
to
pleasure
the
queen
and
to
help
the
custom
of
their
own
and
their
neighbours
shops
busy
and
proud
men
they
were
and
no
smaller
were
the
worshipful
deacons
of
the
crafts
it
was
just
a
surprise
and
consternation
to
everybody
to
think
how
their
weak
backs
could
bear
such
a
burden
of
cares
no
time
had
they
for
their
wonted
jocosity
to
those
who
would
fain
have
speered
the
news
they
shook
their
heads
in
a
manner
and
hastened
by
and
such
a
battle
and
tribulation
as
they
had
with
their
vassals
the
magistrates
of
leith
who
in
the
most
contumacious
manner
insisted
that
their
chief
bailie
should
be
the
first
to
welcome
the
sovereign
on
the
shore
this
pretence
was
thought
little
short
of
rebellion
and
the
provost
and
the
bailies
and
all
the
wise
men
that
sat
in
council
with
them
together
with
the
help
of
their
learned
assessors
continued
deliberating
anent
the
same
for
hours
together
it
was
a
dreadful
business
that
for
the
town
of
edinburgh
and
the
opinions
of
the
judges
of
the
land
and
the
lords
of
the
council
were
taken
and
many
a
device
tried
to
overcome
the
upsetting
as
it
was
called
of
the
leith
magistrates
but
all
was
of
no
avail
and
it
was
thought
there
would
have
been
a
fight
between
the
bailies
of
leith
and
the
bailies
of
edinburgh
and
that
blood
would
have
been
shed
before
this
weighty
question
so
important
to
the
dearest
interests
of
the
commonweal
of
scotland
could
be
determined
but
in
the
midst
of
their
contention
and
before
their
preparations
were
half
finished
the
queen
arrived
in
leith
roads
and
the
news
came
upon
them
like
the
cry
to
the
foolish
virgins
of
the
bridegroom
in
the
street
then
they
were
seen
flying
to
their
respective
places
of
abode
to
dress
themselves
in
their
coats
of
black
velvet
their
doublets
of
crimson
satin
and
their
hose
of
the
same
colour
which
they
had
prepared
for
the
occasion
anon
they
met
in
the
what
confusion
reigned
there
then
how
they
flew
down
the
street
provost
maccalzean
with
the
silver
keys
in
his
hand
and
the
eldest
bailie
with
the
cod
whereon
they
were
to
be
delivered
to
her
majesty
following
as
fast
as
any
member
of
a
city
corporation
could
be
reasonably
expected
to
do
but
how
the
provost
fell
and
how
the
bailies
and
tumbled
over
him
and
how
the
crowd
shouted
at
the
sight
are
things
whereof
to
understand
the
greatness
it
is
needful
that
the
courteous
reader
should
have
heard
my
aunty
agnes
herself
rehearse
the
extraordinary
particularities
meanwhile
the
queen
left
her
galley
in
a
small
boat
and
the
bailies
of
leith
had
scarcely
time
to
reach
the
pier
before
she
was
on
shore
alas
it
was
an
landing
few
were
spectators
and
none
cheered
the
solitary
lady
who
as
she
looked
around
and
heard
no
loyal
greeting
nor
beheld
any
show
of
hospitable
welcome
seemed
to
feel
as
if
the
spirit
of
the
land
was
sullen
at
her
approach
and
grudged
at
her
return
to
the
dark
abodes
of
her
fierce
ancestors
in
all
the
way
from
leith
to
holyrood
she
never
spoke
but
the
tear
was
in
her
eye
and
the
sigh
in
her
bosom
and
though
her
people
gathered
when
it
was
known
she
had
landed
and
began
at
last
to
shout
it
was
owre
late
to
prevent
the
mournful
forebodings
which
taught
her
to
expect
but
disappointments
and
sorrows
from
subjects
so
torn
with
their
own
factions
as
to
lack
even
the
courtesies
due
to
their
sovereign
a
stranger
and
the
fairest
lady
of
all
her
time
chapter
xxviii
soon
after
queen
mary
return
from
france
my
grandfather
with
his
wife
and
agnes
kilspinnie
came
from
edinburgh
and
took
up
their
residence
on
his
own
free
mailing
of
quharist
where
the
lady
eglinton
was
as
good
as
her
word
in
presenting
to
them
divers
articles
of
fine
napery
and
sundry
things
of
plenishing
both
for
ornament
and
use
and
there
he
would
have
spent
his
days
in
blameless
tranquillity
serving
the
lord
but
for
the
new
storm
that
began
to
gather
over
the
church
whereof
it
is
needful
that
i
should
now
proceed
to
tell
some
of
the
circumstantials
no
sooner
had
that
thoughtless
princess
if
indeed
one
could
be
so
called
who
though
reckless
of
all
consequences
was
yet
double
beyond
the
imagination
of
man
no
sooner
i
say
had
she
found
herself
at
home
than
with
all
the
craft
and
blandishments
of
her
winning
airs
and
peerless
beauty
she
did
set
herself
to
seduce
the
lords
of
the
congregation
from
the
sternness
wherewith
they
had
thrown
down
and
were
determined
to
resist
the
restoration
of
the
roman
idolatry
and
with
some
of
them
she
succeeded
so
far
that
the
popish
priests
were
hearkened
and
knowing
her
avowed
partiality
for
their
sect
the
beast
began
to
shoot
out
its
horns
again
and
they
dared
to
perform
the
abomination
of
the
mass
in
different
quarters
of
the
kingdom
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
the
queen
council
by
proclamation
feigned
to
discountenance
that
resuscitation
of
idolatry
but
the
words
of
their
edict
being
backed
by
no
demonstration
of
resolution
save
in
the
case
of
a
few
worthy
gentlemen
in
the
shire
of
ayr
and
in
galloway
who
took
up
some
of
the
offenders
in
their
district
and
jurisdiction
the
evil
continued
to
strike
its
roots
and
to
bud
and
nourish
in
its
pestiferous
branches
when
my
grandfather
heard
of
these
things
his
spirit
was
exceedingly
moved
and
he
got
no
rest
in
the
night
with
the
warsling
of
troubled
thoughts
and
pious
fears
some
new
call
he
foresaw
would
soon
be
made
on
the
protestants
to
stand
forth
again
in
the
gap
that
the
arts
had
sapped
in
the
bulwarks
of
their
religious
liberty
and
he
resolved
to
be
ready
against
the
hour
of
danger
so
taking
his
wife
and
agnes
kilspinnie
with
him
he
went
in
the
spring
to
edinburgh
and
hired
a
lodging
for
them
and
on
the
same
night
he
presented
himself
at
the
lodging
of
the
lord
james
stuart
who
had
some
time
before
been
created
earl
of
murray
but
the
earl
was
gone
with
the
queen
to
loch
leven
sir
alexander
douglas
however
the
master
of
his
lordship
horse
was
then
on
the
eve
of
following
him
with
john
knox
to
whom
the
queen
had
sent
a
peremptory
message
requiring
his
attendance
and
sir
alexander
invited
my
grandfather
to
come
with
them
the
which
invitation
he
very
joyfully
accepted
on
account
of
the
happy
occasion
of
travelling
in
the
sanctified
company
of
that
brave
worthy
in
the
journey
however
save
in
the
boat
when
they
crossed
the
ferry
he
showed
but
little
of
his
precious
conversation
for
the
knight
and
the
reformer
rode
on
together
some
short
distance
before
their
train
earnestly
discoursing
and
seemingly
they
wished
not
to
be
overheard
but
when
they
were
all
seated
in
the
the
ardour
of
the
preacher
which
on
no
occasion
would
be
reined
in
led
him
to
continue
speaking
by
which
it
would
seem
that
they
had
been
conversing
anent
the
queen
prejudices
in
matters
of
religion
and
the
royal
authority
when
i
last
spoke
with
her
highness
said
john
knox
she
laid
sore
to
my
charge
that
i
had
brought
the
people
to
receive
a
religion
different
from
what
their
princes
allowed
asking
sharply
if
this
was
not
contrary
to
the
divine
command
which
enjoins
that
subjects
should
obey
their
rulers
so
that
i
was
obliged
to
contend
plainly
that
true
religion
derived
its
origin
and
authority
not
from
princes
but
from
god
that
princes
were
often
most
ignorant
respecting
it
and
that
subjects
never
could
be
bound
to
frame
their
religious
sentiments
according
to
the
pleasure
of
their
rulers
else
the
hebrews
ought
to
have
conformed
to
the
idolatry
of
pharaoh
and
daniel
and
his
associates
to
that
of
nebuchadnezzar
and
the
primitive
christians
to
that
of
the
roman
emperors
and
what
could
her
highness
answer
to
this
said
sir
alexander
she
lacketh
not
the
gift
of
a
shrewd
and
ready
wit
replied
master
knox
for
she
nimbly
remarked
that
though
it
was
as
i
had
said
yet
none
of
those
men
raised
the
sword
against
their
princes
which
enforced
me
to
be
more
subtle
than
i
was
minded
to
have
been
and
to
say
that
nevertheless
they
did
resist
for
those
who
obey
not
the
commandments
given
them
do
in
verity
resist
ay
cried
her
highness
but
not
with
the
sword
which
was
a
thrust
not
easy
to
be
turned
aside
so
that
i
was
constrained
to
speak
out
saying
god
madam
had
not
given
them
the
means
and
the
power
then
said
she
still
more
eagerly
think
you
that
subjects
having
the
power
may
resist
their
princes
and
she
looked
with
a
triumphant
smile
as
if
she
had
caught
me
in
a
trap
but
i
replied
if
princes
exceed
their
bounds
no
doubt
they
may
be
resisted
even
by
power
for
no
greater
honour
or
greater
obedience
is
to
be
given
to
kings
and
princes
than
god
has
commanded
to
be
given
to
father
or
mother
but
the
father
may
be
struck
with
a
frenzy
in
which
he
would
slay
his
children
in
such
a
case
if
the
children
arise
join
together
apprehend
the
father
take
the
sword
from
him
bind
his
hands
and
keep
him
in
prison
till
the
frenzy
be
over
think
you
madam
quo
i
that
the
children
do
any
wrong
even
so
is
it
with
princes
that
would
slay
the
children
of
god
that
are
subject
to
them
their
blind
zeal
is
nothing
but
frenzy
and
therefore
to
take
the
power
from
them
till
they
be
brought
to
a
more
sober
mind
is
no
disobedience
to
princes
but
a
just
accordance
to
the
will
of
god
so
i
doubt
not
continued
the
reformer
i
shall
again
have
to
sustain
the
keen
encounter
of
her
highness
wit
in
some
new
controversy
this
was
the
chief
substance
of
what
my
grandfather
heard
pass
in
the
boat
and
when
they
were
again
mounted
the
knight
and
preacher
set
forward
as
before
some
twenty
paces
or
so
in
advance
of
the
retinue
on
reaching
kinross
master
knox
rode
straight
to
the
shore
and
went
off
in
the
queen
barge
to
the
castle
that
he
might
present
himself
to
her
highness
before
supper
for
by
this
time
the
sun
was
far
down
in
the
meantime
my
grandfather
went
to
the
house
in
kinross
where
the
earl
of
murray
resided
and
his
lordship
though
albeit
a
grave
and
reserved
man
received
him
with
the
familiar
kindness
of
an
old
friend
and
he
was
with
him
when
the
reformer
came
back
from
the
queen
who
had
dealt
very
earnestly
with
him
to
persuade
the
gentlemen
of
the
west
country
to
desist
from
their
interruption
of
the
popish
worship
but
to
this
said
the
reformer
to
the
earl
i
was
obligated
by
conscience
and
the
fear
of
god
to
say
that
if
her
majesty
would
exert
her
authority
in
executing
the
laws
of
the
land
i
would
undertake
for
the
peaceable
behaviour
of
the
protestants
but
if
she
thought
to
evade
them
there
were
some
who
would
not
let
the
papists
offend
with
impunity
will
you
allow
exclaimed
her
highness
that
they
shall
take
my
sword
in
their
hands
the
sword
of
justice
is
god
i
replied
and
is
given
to
princes
and
rulers
for
an
end
which
if
they
transgress
sparing
the
wicked
and
oppressing
the
innocent
they
who
in
the
fear
of
god
execute
judgment
where
god
has
commanded
offend
not
god
although
kings
do
it
not
the
gentlemen
of
the
west
madam
are
acting
strictly
according
to
law
for
the
act
of
parliament
gave
power
to
all
judges
within
their
jurisdiction
to
search
for
and
punish
those
who
transgress
its
enactments
and
i
added
it
shall
be
profitable
to
your
majesty
to
consider
what
is
the
thing
your
grace
subjects
look
to
receive
of
your
majesty
and
what
it
is
that
ye
ought
to
do
unto
them
by
mutual
contract
they
are
bound
to
obey
you
and
that
not
but
in
god
ye
are
bound
to
keep
laws
to
them
ye
crave
of
them
service
they
crave
of
you
protection
and
defence
now
madam
if
you
shall
deny
your
duty
unto
them
which
especially
craves
that
ye
punish
malefactors
can
ye
expect
to
receive
full
obedience
of
them
i
fear
madam
ye
shall
not
you
have
indeed
been
plain
with
her
highness
said
the
earl
thoughtfully
and
what
reply
made
she
none
said
the
reformer
her
countenance
changed
she
turned
her
head
abruptly
from
me
and
without
the
courtesy
of
a
signified
with
an
angry
waving
of
her
hand
that
she
desired
to
be
rid
of
my
presence
whereupon
i
immediately
retired
and
please
god
i
shall
betimes
in
the
morning
return
to
my
duties
at
edinburgh
it
is
with
a
sad
heart
my
lord
that
i
am
compelled
to
think
and
to
say
to
you
who
stand
so
near
to
her
in
kin
and
affection
that
i
doubt
she
is
not
only
proud
but
crafty
not
only
wedded
to
the
popish
faith
but
averse
to
instruction
she
neither
is
nor
will
be
of
our
opinion
and
it
is
plain
that
the
lessons
of
her
uncle
the
cardinal
are
so
deeply
printed
in
her
heart
that
the
substance
and
quality
will
perish
together
i
would
be
glad
to
be
deceived
in
this
but
i
fear
i
shall
not
never
have
i
espied
such
art
in
one
so
young
and
it
will
need
all
the
eyes
of
the
reformed
to
watch
and
ward
that
she
circumvent
not
the
strong
hold
in
christ
that
has
been
but
so
lately
restored
and
fortified
in
this
misfortunate
kingdom
nothing
farther
passed
that
night
but
the
servants
being
called
in
and
the
preacher
having
exhorted
them
in
their
duties
and
prayed
with
even
more
than
his
wonted
earnestness
each
one
retired
to
his
chamber
and
the
earl
gave
orders
for
horses
to
be
ready
early
in
the
morning
to
convey
master
knox
back
to
edinburgh
this
however
was
not
permitted
for
by
break
of
day
a
messenger
came
from
the
castle
desiring
him
not
to
depart
until
he
had
again
spoken
with
her
majesty
adding
that
as
she
meant
to
land
by
sunrise
with
her
falconer
she
would
meet
him
on
the
fields
where
she
intended
to
take
her
pastime
and
talk
with
him
there
chapter
xxix
in
the
morning
all
those
who
were
in
the
house
with
the
earl
of
murray
and
john
knox
were
early
afoot
and
after
prayers
had
been
said
they
went
out
to
meet
the
queen
at
her
place
of
landing
from
the
castle
which
stands
on
an
islet
at
some
distance
from
the
shore
but
before
they
reached
the
spot
she
was
already
mounted
on
her
jennet
and
the
hawks
unhooded
so
that
they
were
obligated
to
follow
her
highness
to
the
ground
the
reformer
leaning
on
the
earl
who
proffered
him
his
left
arm
as
they
walked
up
the
steep
bank
together
from
the
brim
of
the
lake
the
queen
was
on
the
upland
when
they
drew
near
to
the
field
and
on
seeing
them
approach
she
came
ambling
towards
them
moving
in
her
beauty
as
my
grandfather
often
delighted
to
say
like
a
fair
rose
caressed
by
the
soft
gales
of
the
summer
a
smile
was
in
her
eye
and
it
brightened
on
her
countenance
like
the
beam
of
something
more
lovely
than
light
the
glow
as
it
were
of
a
spirit
conscious
of
its
power
and
which
had
graced
itself
with
all
its
enchantments
to
conquer
some
stubborn
heart
even
the
earl
of
murray
was
struck
with
the
unwonted
splendour
of
her
that
was
ever
deemed
so
surpassing
fair
and
john
knox
said
with
a
sigh
the
maker
had
indeed
taken
gracious
pains
with
the
goodly
fashion
of
such
perishable
clay
when
she
had
come
within
a
few
paces
of
where
they
were
advancing
uncovered
she
suddenly
checked
her
jennet
and
made
him
dance
proudly
round
till
she
was
nigh
to
john
knox
where
seeming
in
alarm
she
feigned
as
if
she
would
have
slipped
from
the
saddle
laying
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
support
and
while
he
with
more
gallantry
than
it
was
thought
in
him
helped
her
to
recover
her
seat
she
said
with
a
ravishing
look
the
queen
thanks
you
master
knox
for
this
upholding
dwelling
on
the
word
this
in
a
special
manner
which
my
grandfather
noticed
the
more
as
he
as
well
as
others
of
the
retinue
observed
that
she
was
playing
as
it
were
in
dalliance
she
then
inquired
kindly
for
his
health
grieving
she
had
not
given
orders
for
him
to
bed
in
the
castle
and
turning
to
the
earl
of
murray
she
chided
his
lordship
with
a
gentleness
that
was
more
winning
than
praise
why
he
had
not
come
to
her
with
master
knox
saying
we
should
then
perhaps
have
not
been
so
sharp
in
our
controversy
but
before
the
earl
had
time
to
make
answer
she
noticed
divers
gentlemen
by
name
and
taking
off
her
glove
made
a
most
sweet
salutation
with
her
lily
hand
to
the
general
concourse
of
those
who
had
by
this
time
gathered
around
in
that
gracious
gesture
it
was
plain
my
grandfather
said
that
she
was
still
scattering
her
feminine
spells
for
she
kept
her
hand
for
some
time
bare
and
though
enjoying
the
pleasure
which
her
beautiful
presence
diffused
like
a
delicious
warmth
into
the
air
she
was
evidently
and
had
something
more
in
mind
than
only
the
triumph
of
her
marvellous
beauty
having
turned
her
horse
head
she
moved
him
a
few
paces
saying
master
knox
i
would
speak
with
you
at
which
he
went
towards
her
and
the
rest
of
the
spectators
retired
and
stood
aloof
they
appeared
for
some
time
to
be
in
an
easy
and
somewhat
gay
discourse
on
her
part
but
she
grew
more
and
more
earnest
till
mr
knox
made
his
reverence
and
was
coming
away
when
she
said
to
him
aloud
well
do
as
you
will
but
that
man
is
a
dangerous
man
their
discourse
was
concerning
the
titular
bishop
of
athens
a
brother
of
the
earl
of
huntly
who
had
been
put
in
nomination
for
a
superintendent
of
the
church
in
the
west
country
and
of
whose
bad
character
her
highness
as
it
afterwards
proved
had
received
a
just
account
but
scarcely
had
the
reformer
retired
two
steps
when
she
called
him
back
and
holding
out
to
him
her
hand
with
which
when
he
approached
to
do
his
homage
she
familiarly
took
hold
of
his
and
held
it
playing
with
his
fingers
as
if
she
had
been
placing
on
a
ring
saying
loud
enough
to
be
heard
by
many
on
the
field
i
have
one
of
the
greatest
matters
that
have
touched
me
since
i
came
into
this
realm
to
open
to
you
and
i
must
have
your
help
in
it
then
still
holding
him
earnestly
by
the
hand
she
entered
into
a
long
discourse
concerning
as
he
afterwards
told
the
earl
of
murray
a
difference
subsisting
between
the
earl
and
countess
of
argyle
her
ladyship
said
the
queen
for
my
grandfather
heard
him
repeat
what
passed
has
not
perhaps
been
so
circumspect
in
everything
as
one
could
have
wished
but
her
lord
has
dealt
harshly
with
her
master
knox
having
once
before
reconciled
the
debates
of
that
honourable
couple
told
her
highness
he
had
done
so
and
that
not
having
since
heard
anything
to
the
contrary
he
had
hoped
all
things
went
well
with
them
it
is
worse
replied
the
queen
than
ye
believe
but
kind
sir
do
this
much
for
my
sake
as
once
again
to
put
them
at
amity
and
if
the
countess
behave
not
herself
as
she
ought
to
do
she
shall
find
no
favour
of
me
but
in
no
wise
let
argyle
know
that
i
have
requested
you
in
this
matter
then
she
returned
to
the
subject
of
their
contest
the
preceding
evening
and
said
with
her
sweetest
looks
and
most
musical
accents
i
promise
to
do
as
ye
required
i
shall
order
all
offenders
to
be
summoned
and
you
shall
see
that
i
shall
minister
justice
to
which
he
replied
i
am
assured
then
madam
that
you
shall
please
god
and
enjoy
rest
and
tranquillity
within
your
realm
which
to
your
majesty
is
more
profitable
than
all
the
pope
power
can
be
and
having
said
this
much
he
made
his
reverence
evidently
in
great
pleasure
with
her
highness
afterwards
in
speaking
to
the
earl
of
murray
as
they
returned
to
kinross
my
grandfather
noted
that
he
employed
many
terms
of
soft
courtliness
saying
of
her
that
she
was
a
lady
who
might
he
thought
with
a
little
pains
be
won
to
grace
and
godliness
could
she
be
preserved
from
the
taint
of
evil
counsellors
so
much
had
the
winning
sorceries
of
her
exceeding
beauty
and
her
blandishments
worked
even
upon
his
stern
honesty
and
enchanted
his
jealousy
asleep
when
master
knox
had
with
the
earl
partaken
of
some
repast
he
requested
that
he
might
be
conveyed
back
to
edinburgh
for
that
it
suited
not
with
his
nature
to
remain
sorning
about
the
skirts
of
the
court
and
his
lordship
bade
my
grandfather
be
of
his
company
and
to
bid
sir
alexander
douglas
the
master
of
his
horse
choose
for
him
the
gentlest
steed
in
his
stable
but
it
happened
before
the
reformer
was
ready
to
depart
that
queen
mary
had
finished
her
morning
pastime
and
was
returning
to
her
barge
to
embark
for
the
castle
which
the
earl
hearing
went
down
to
the
brim
of
the
loch
to
assist
at
her
embarkation
my
grandfather
with
others
also
hastened
to
the
spot
on
seeing
his
lordship
she
inquired
for
her
friend
as
she
then
called
john
knox
and
signified
her
regret
that
he
had
been
so
list
to
leave
her
expressing
her
surprise
that
one
so
infirm
should
think
so
soon
of
a
second
journey
whereby
the
good
earl
being
minded
to
cement
their
happy
reconciliation
from
which
he
augured
a
great
increase
of
benefits
both
to
the
realm
and
the
cause
of
religion
was
led
to
speak
of
his
concern
thereat
likewise
and
of
his
sorrow
that
all
his
own
horses
at
kinross
being
for
the
chase
and
road
he
had
none
to
carry
a
person
so
aged
and
but
little
used
to
the
toil
of
riding
her
highness
smiled
at
the
hidden
counselling
of
this
remark
for
she
was
possessed
of
a
sharp
spirit
and
she
said
with
a
look
which
told
the
earl
and
all
about
her
that
she
discerned
the
pith
of
his
discourse
she
would
order
one
of
her
own
palfreys
to
be
forthwith
prepared
for
him
when
the
earl
returned
from
the
shore
and
informed
master
knox
of
the
queen
gracious
condescension
he
made
no
reply
but
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
his
sense
of
her
kindness
and
soon
after
when
the
palfrey
was
brought
saddled
with
the
other
horses
to
the
door
he
said
in
my
grandfather
hearing
to
his
lordship
it
needs
you
see
my
lord
must
be
so
for
were
i
not
to
accept
this
grace
it
might
be
thought
i
refused
from
a
vain
bravery
of
caring
nothing
for
her
majesty
favour
and
he
added
with
a
smile
of
jocularity
whereas
i
am
right
well
content
to
receive
the
very
smallest
boon
from
so
fair
and
blooming
a
lady
nothing
of
any
particularity
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
journey
for
the
main
part
of
which
master
knox
was
thoughtful
and
knit
up
in
his
own
cogitations
and
when
from
time
to
time
he
did
enter
into
discourse
with
my
grandfather
he
spoke
chiefly
of
certain
usages
and
customs
that
he
had
observed
in
other
lands
and
of
things
of
indifferent
import
but
nevertheless
there
was
a
flavour
of
holiness
in
all
he
said
and
my
grandfather
treasured
many
of
his
sweet
sentences
as
pearls
of
great
price
chapter
xxx
before
the
occurrence
of
the
things
spoken
of
in
the
foregoing
chapter
the
great
earl
of
glencairn
my
grandfather
first
and
constant
patron
had
been
dead
some
time
but
his
son
and
successor
who
knew
the
estimation
in
which
he
had
been
held
by
his
father
being
then
in
edinburgh
allowed
him
in
consideration
thereof
the
privilege
of
his
hall
it
suited
not
however
with
my
grandfather
quiet
and
sanctified
nature
to
mingle
much
with
the
brawlers
that
used
to
hover
there
nevertheless
out
of
a
respect
to
the
earl
hospitality
he
did
occasionally
go
thither
and
where
if
he
heard
little
to
edify
the
christian
heart
he
learnt
divers
things
anent
the
queen
and
court
that
made
his
fears
and
anxieties
wax
stronger
and
stronger
it
seemed
to
him
as
he
often
was
heard
to
say
that
there
was
a
better
knowledge
of
queen
mary
true
character
and
secret
partialities
among
those
loose
varlets
than
among
their
masters
and
her
marriage
being
then
in
the
parlance
of
the
people
and
much
dread
and
fear
rife
with
the
protestants
that
she
would
choose
a
papist
for
her
husband
he
was
surprised
to
hear
many
of
the
lewd
knaves
in
glencairn
hall
speak
lightly
of
the
respect
she
would
have
to
the
faith
or
spirituality
of
the
man
she
might
prefer
among
those
wuddy
worthies
he
fell
in
with
his
ancient
adversary
winterton
who
instead
of
harbouring
any
resentment
for
the
trick
he
played
him
in
the
lord
boyd
castle
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
again
he
himself
was
then
in
the
service
of
david
rizzio
the
fiddler
whom
the
queen
some
short
time
before
had
taken
into
her
particular
service
this
rizzio
was
by
birth
an
italian
of
very
low
degree
a
man
of
crouched
stature
and
of
an
uncomely
physiognomy
being
and
with
a
and
little
quick
eyes
of
a
free
and
familiar
glance
but
shrewd
withal
and
possessed
of
a
pleasant
way
of
winning
facetiously
on
the
ladies
to
the
which
his
singular
skill
in
all
manner
of
melodious
music
helped
not
a
little
so
that
he
had
great
sway
with
them
and
was
then
winning
himself
fast
into
the
favour
in
which
ambition
besides
the
natural
instigations
of
his
own
vanity
he
was
spirited
on
by
certain
powerful
personages
of
the
papistical
faction
who
soon
saw
the
great
efficacy
it
would
be
of
to
their
cause
to
have
one
who
owed
his
rise
to
them
constantly
about
the
queen
and
in
the
depths
of
all
her
personal
correspondence
with
her
great
friends
abroad
but
the
subtle
italian
though
still
true
to
his
papal
breeding
built
upon
the
queen
partiality
more
than
on
the
favour
of
those
proud
nobles
and
about
the
time
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
he
carried
his
head
at
court
as
bravely
as
the
boldest
baron
amongst
them
still
in
this
he
had
as
yet
done
nothing
greatly
to
offend
the
protestant
lords
however
independent
of
their
aversion
to
him
on
account
his
religion
felt
in
common
with
all
the
nobility
a
vehement
prejudice
against
an
alien
one
too
of
base
blood
and
they
openly
manifested
their
displeasure
at
seeing
him
so
gorgeous
and
presuming
even
in
the
public
presence
of
the
queen
but
he
regarded
not
their
anger
in
this
fey
man
service
winterton
then
was
and
my
grandfather
never
doubted
that
it
was
for
no
good
he
came
so
often
to
the
earl
of
glencairn
who
though
not
a
man
of
the
same
weight
in
the
realm
as
the
old
earl
his
father
was
yet
held
in
much
esteem
as
a
sincere
protestant
and
true
nobleman
by
all
the
friends
of
the
gospel
cause
and
in
the
sequel
what
my
grandfather
jealoused
was
soon
very
plainly
seen
for
rizzio
learning
through
winterton
espionage
and
that
of
other
emissaries
how
little
the
people
of
scotland
would
relish
a
foreign
prince
to
be
set
over
them
had
a
hand
in
dissuading
the
queen
from
accepting
any
of
the
matches
then
proposed
for
her
and
the
better
to
make
his
own
power
the
more
sicker
he
afterwards
laid
snares
in
the
water
to
bring
about
a
marriage
with
that
weak
young
prince
the
lord
henry
darnley
but
it
falls
not
within
the
scope
of
my
narrative
to
enter
into
any
more
particulars
here
concerning
that
italian
and
the
tragical
doom
which
with
the
queen
imprudence
he
brought
upon
himself
for
after
spending
some
weeks
in
edinburgh
and
in
visiting
their
friends
at
crail
my
grandfather
returned
with
his
wife
and
agnes
kilspinnie
to
quharist
where
he
continued
to
reside
several
years
but
not
in
tranquillity
hardly
had
they
reached
their
home
when
word
came
of
quarrels
among
the
nobility
and
though
the
same
sprung
out
of
secular
debates
they
had
much
of
the
leaven
of
religious
faction
in
their
causes
the
which
greatly
exasperated
the
enmity
wherewith
they
were
carried
on
but
even
in
the
good
earl
of
murray
raid
there
was
nothing
which
called
on
my
grandfather
to
bear
a
part
nevertheless
those
quarrels
disquieted
his
soul
and
he
heard
the
sough
of
discontents
rising
afar
off
like
the
roar
of
the
bars
of
ayr
when
they
betoken
a
coming
tempest
after
the
departure
of
the
earl
of
murray
to
france
there
was
a
syncope
in
the
land
and
men
minds
were
filled
with
wonder
and
with
apprehensions
to
which
they
could
give
no
name
neighbours
distrusted
one
another
the
papists
looked
out
from
their
secret
places
and
were
saluted
with
a
fear
that
wore
the
semblance
of
reverence
the
queen
married
darnley
and
discreet
men
marvelled
at
the
rashness
with
which
the
match
was
concluded
there
being
seemingly
no
cause
for
such
uncomely
haste
nor
for
the
lavish
favours
that
she
heaped
upon
him
it
was
viewed
with
awe
as
a
thing
done
under
the
impulses
of
fraud
or
fainness
or
fatality
nor
was
their
cold
when
her
eager
love
changed
into
aversion
then
the
spirit
of
the
times
which
had
long
hovered
in
willingness
to
be
pleased
with
her
intentions
began
to
alter
its
breathings
and
to
whisper
darkly
against
her
at
last
the
murder
of
rizzio
a
deed
which
though
in
the
main
satisfactory
to
the
nation
was
yet
so
foul
and
cruel
in
the
perpetration
that
the
tidings
of
it
came
like
a
over
all
the
kingdom
the
birth
of
prince
james
which
soon
after
followed
gave
no
joy
for
about
the
same
time
a
low
and
terrible
whispering
began
to
be
heard
of
some
hideous
and
universal
conspiracy
against
all
the
protestants
throughout
europe
none
ventured
to
say
that
queen
mary
was
joined
with
the
conspirators
but
many
preachers
openly
prayed
that
she
might
be
preserved
from
their
leagues
in
a
way
that
showed
what
they
feared
besides
this
suspicion
mournful
things
were
told
of
her
behaviour
and
the
immoralities
of
her
courtiers
and
their
trains
rose
to
such
a
pitch
compared
with
the
chastity
and
plain
manners
of
her
mother
court
that
the
whole
land
was
vexed
with
angry
thoughts
and
echoed
to
the
rumours
with
stern
menaces
no
one
was
more
disturbed
by
these
things
than
my
pious
grandfather
and
the
apprehensions
which
they
caused
in
him
came
to
such
a
head
at
last
that
his
wife
becoming
fearful
of
his
health
advised
him
to
take
a
journey
to
edinburgh
in
order
that
he
might
hear
and
see
with
his
own
ears
and
eyes
which
he
accordingly
did
and
on
his
arrival
went
straight
to
the
earl
of
glencairn
and
begged
permission
to
take
on
again
his
livery
chiefly
that
he
might
pass
unnoticed
and
not
be
remarked
as
having
neither
calling
nor
vocation
that
nobleman
was
surprised
with
his
request
but
without
asking
any
questions
gave
him
leave
and
again
invited
him
to
use
the
freedom
of
his
hall
so
he
continued
as
one
of
his
retainers
till
the
earl
of
murray
return
from
france
but
before
speaking
of
what
then
ensued
there
are
some
things
concerning
the
murder
of
the
the
queen
protestant
husband
the
blackest
of
the
sins
of
that
age
of
which
in
so
far
as
my
grandfather
participated
it
is
meet
and
proper
i
should
previously
speak
chapter
xxxi
while
the
cloud
of
troubles
whereof
i
have
spoken
in
the
foregoing
chapter
was
thickening
and
darkening
over
the
land
the
event
of
the
king
dreadful
death
came
to
pass
the
which
though
in
its
birth
most
foul
and
monstrous
filling
the
hearts
of
all
men
with
consternation
and
horror
was
yet
a
mean
in
the
hands
of
providence
as
shall
hereafter
appear
whereby
the
kingdom
of
the
lord
was
established
in
scotland
concerning
that
fearful
treason
my
grandfather
never
spoke
without
taking
off
his
bonnet
and
praying
inwardly
with
such
solemnity
of
countenance
that
none
could
behold
him
unmoved
of
all
the
remarkable
passages
of
his
long
life
it
was
indeed
the
most
remarkable
and
he
has
been
heard
to
say
that
he
could
not
well
acquit
himself
of
the
actual
sin
of
disobedience
in
not
obeying
an
admonition
of
the
spirit
which
was
vouchsafed
to
him
on
that
occasion
for
some
time
there
had
been
a
great
variance
between
the
king
and
queen
he
had
given
himself
over
to
loose
and
low
companions
and
though
she
kept
her
state
and
pride
ill
was
said
of
her
if
in
her
walk
and
conversation
she
was
more
sensible
of
her
high
dignity
all
at
once
however
when
he
was
lying
ill
at
glasgow
of
a
malady
which
many
scrupled
not
to
say
was
engendered
by
a
malignant
medicine
there
was
a
singular
demonstration
of
returning
affection
on
her
part
the
more
remarkable
and
the
more
heeded
of
the
commonality
on
account
of
its
suddenness
and
the
events
that
ensued
for
while
he
was
at
the
worst
she
minded
not
his
condition
but
took
her
delights
and
pastimes
in
divers
parts
of
the
country
no
sooner
however
had
his
strength
overcome
the
disease
than
she
was
seized
with
this
fond
sympathy
and
came
flying
with
her
endearments
seemingly
to
foster
his
recovery
with
caresses
and
love
the
which
excessive
affection
was
afterwards
ascribed
to
a
guilty
hypocrisy
for
in
the
sequel
it
came
to
light
that
while
she
was
practising
all
those
winning
blandishments
which
few
knew
the
art
of
better
and
with
which
she
regained
his
confidence
she
was
at
the
same
time
engaged
in
unconjugal
correspondence
with
the
earl
of
bothwell
the
king
however
was
won
by
her
kindness
and
consented
to
be
removed
from
among
the
friends
of
his
family
at
glasgow
to
edinburgh
in
order
that
he
might
there
enjoy
the
benefits
of
her
soft
cares
and
the
salutary
attendance
of
the
physicians
of
the
capital
the
house
of
the
provost
of
kirk
o
field
which
stood
not
far
from
the
spot
where
the
buildings
of
the
college
now
stand
was
accordingly
prepared
for
his
reception
on
account
of
the
advantages
which
it
afforded
for
the
free
and
open
air
of
a
rising
ground
but
it
was
also
a
solitary
place
a
fit
haunt
for
midnight
conspirators
and
the
dark
purposes
of
mysterious
crime
there
for
some
time
the
queen
lavished
upon
him
all
the
endearing
gentleness
of
a
true
and
loving
wife
being
seldom
absent
by
day
and
sleeping
near
his
at
night
the
land
was
blithened
with
such
assurances
of
their
reconciliation
and
the
king
himself
with
the
frank
ardour
of
flattered
youth
was
contrite
for
his
faults
and
promised
her
the
fondest
devotion
of
all
his
future
days
in
this
sweet
cordiality
on
sunday
the
of
february
she
parted
from
him
to
be
present
at
a
masquing
in
the
palace
for
the
reformation
had
not
so
penetrated
into
the
habits
and
business
of
men
as
to
hallow
the
sabbath
in
the
way
it
has
since
done
amongst
us
but
before
proceeding
farther
it
is
proper
to
resume
the
thread
of
my
grandfather
story
he
had
passed
that
evening
as
he
was
wont
to
tell
in
pleasant
gospel
conversation
with
several
acquaintances
in
the
house
of
one
raphael
doquet
a
pious
lawyer
in
the
canongate
for
even
many
writers
in
those
days
were
smitten
with
the
love
of
godliness
and
as
he
was
returning
to
his
dry
lodgings
in
an
entry
now
called
baron
grant
close
he
encountered
winterton
who
after
an
end
had
been
put
to
david
rizzio
became
a
retainer
in
the
riotous
household
of
the
earl
of
bothwell
this
happened
a
short
way
aboon
the
netherbow
and
my
grandfather
stopped
to
speak
with
him
but
there
was
a
haste
and
confusion
in
his
manner
which
made
him
rather
eschew
this
civility
my
grandfather
at
the
time
however
did
not
much
remark
it
but
scarcely
had
they
parted
ten
paces
when
a
sudden
jealousy
of
some
unknown
guilt
or
danger
wherein
winterton
was
concerned
came
into
his
mind
like
a
flash
of
fire
and
he
felt
as
it
were
an
invisible
power
constraining
him
to
dog
his
steps
in
so
much
that
he
actually
did
turn
back
but
on
reaching
the
bow
he
was
obligated
to
stop
for
the
ward
was
changing
and
observing
that
the
soldiers
then
posting
were
of
the
queen
french
guard
his
thoughts
began
to
run
on
the
rumour
that
was
bruited
of
a
league
among
the
papist
princes
to
cut
off
all
the
reformed
with
one
universal
sweep
of
the
scythe
of
persecution
and
he
felt
himself
moved
and
incited
to
go
to
some
of
the
lords
and
leaders
of
the
congregation
to
warn
them
of
what
he
feared
but
considering
that
he
had
only
a
vague
and
unaccountable
suspicion
for
his
thought
he
wavered
and
finally
returned
home
thus
though
manifestly
and
marvellously
instructed
of
the
fruition
of
some
bloody
business
in
hand
that
night
he
was
yet
overruled
by
the
wisdom
which
is
of
this
world
to
suppress
and
refuse
obedience
to
the
promptings
of
the
inspiration
on
reaching
his
chamber
he
unbuckled
his
belt
as
his
custom
was
and
laid
down
his
sword
and
began
to
undress
when
again
the
same
alarm
from
on
high
fell
upon
him
and
the
same
warning
spirit
whispered
to
his
mind
ear
unspeakable
intimations
of
dreadful
things
fear
came
upon
him
and
trembling
which
made
all
his
bones
to
shake
and
he
lifted
his
sword
and
again
buckled
on
his
belt
but
again
the
prudence
of
this
world
prevailed
and
heeding
not
the
admonition
to
warn
the
lords
of
the
congregation
he
threw
himself
on
his
bed
without
however
unbuckling
his
sword
and
in
that
condition
fell
asleep
but
though
his
senses
were
shut
his
mind
continued
awake
and
he
had
fearful
visions
of
bloody
hands
and
glimmering
daggers
gleaming
over
him
from
behind
his
curtains
till
in
terror
he
started
up
gasping
like
one
that
had
struggled
with
a
stronger
than
himself
when
he
had
in
some
degree
composed
his
thoughts
he
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
to
see
by
the
stars
how
far
the
night
had
passed
the
window
overlooked
the
north
loch
and
the
swelling
bank
beyond
and
the
distant
frith
and
the
hills
of
fife
the
skies
were
calm
and
clear
and
the
air
was
tempered
with
a
bright
frost
the
stars
in
their
courses
were
reflected
in
the
still
waters
of
the
north
loch
as
if
there
had
been
an
opening
through
the
earth
showing
the
other
concave
of
the
spangled
firmament
but
the
dark
outline
of
the
swelling
bank
on
the
northern
side
was
like
the
awful
corpse
of
some
mighty
thing
prepared
for
interment
as
my
grandfather
stood
in
contemplation
at
the
window
he
heard
the
occasional
churme
of
discourse
from
passengers
still
abroad
and
now
and
then
the
braggart
flourish
of
a
trumpet
resounded
from
the
royal
masquing
at
the
palace
breaking
upon
the
holiness
of
the
night
with
the
harsh
dissonance
of
a
discord
in
some
solemn
and
as
he
was
meditating
on
many
things
and
grieving
in
spirit
at
the
dark
fate
of
poor
scotland
and
the
woes
with
which
the
children
of
salvation
were
environed
he
was
startled
by
the
apparition
of
a
great
blaze
in
the
air
which
for
a
moment
lighted
up
all
the
land
with
a
wild
and
fiery
light
and
he
beheld
in
the
glass
of
the
north
loch
reflected
from
behind
the
shadow
of
the
city
a
tremendous
eruption
of
burning
beams
and
rafters
burst
into
the
sky
while
a
horrible
crash
as
if
the
chariots
of
destruction
were
themselves
breaking
down
shook
the
town
like
an
earthquake
he
was
for
an
instant
astounded
but
soon
roused
by
the
clangour
of
an
alarm
from
the
castle
and
while
a
cry
rose
from
all
the
city
as
if
the
last
trumpet
itself
was
sounding
he
rushed
into
the
street
where
the
inhabitants
as
they
had
flown
from
their
beds
were
running
in
consternation
like
the
sheeted
dead
startled
from
their
graves
drums
beat
to
arms
the
bells
rang
some
cried
the
wild
cry
of
fire
and
there
was
wailing
and
weeping
and
many
stood
dumb
with
horror
and
could
give
no
answer
to
the
universal
god
of
the
heavens
what
is
this
presently
a
voice
was
heard
crying
the
king
the
king
and
all
as
if
moved
by
one
spirit
replied
the
king
the
king
then
for
a
moment
there
was
a
silence
stiller
than
the
midnight
hour
and
drum
nor
bell
nor
voice
was
heard
but
a
rushing
of
the
multitude
towards
st
mary
port
which
leads
to
the
kirk
o
field
among
others
my
grandfather
hastened
to
the
spot
by
todrick
wynd
and
as
he
was
running
down
towards
the
postern
gate
he
came
with
great
violence
against
a
man
who
was
struggling
up
through
the
torrent
of
the
people
without
cap
or
cloak
and
seemingly
maddened
with
terrors
urged
by
some
strong
instinct
my
grandfather
grasped
him
by
the
throat
for
by
the
glimpse
of
the
lights
that
were
then
placing
at
every
window
he
saw
it
was
winterton
but
a
swirl
of
the
crowd
tore
them
asunder
and
he
had
only
time
to
cry
it
ane
of
bothwell
men
the
people
caught
the
earl
name
but
instead
of
seizing
the
fugitive
they
repeated
bothwell
bothwell
he
the
traitor
and
pressed
more
eagerly
on
to
the
ruins
of
the
house
which
were
still
burning
the
walls
were
rent
and
in
many
places
thrown
down
the
west
gable
was
blown
clean
away
and
the
very
ground
on
the
side
where
the
chamber
had
been
was
torn
as
with
a
hundred
ploughshares
certain
trees
that
grew
hard
by
were
cleft
and
riven
as
with
a
thunderbolt
and
stones
were
sticking
in
their
timber
like
wedges
and
the
shot
of
cannon
it
was
thought
that
in
such
a
sudden
blast
of
desolation
nothing
in
the
house
could
have
withstood
the
shock
but
that
all
therein
must
have
been
shivered
to
atoms
when
however
the
day
began
to
dawn
it
was
seen
that
many
things
had
escaped
unblemished
by
the
fire
and
the
king
body
with
that
of
the
servant
who
watched
in
his
chamber
was
found
in
a
neighbouring
garden
without
having
suffered
any
material
change
the
which
caused
the
greater
marvelling
for
it
thereby
appeared
that
they
were
the
only
sufferers
in
that
dark
treason
making
the
truth
plain
before
the
people
that
the
contrivance
and
firing
thereof
was
concerted
and
brought
to
maturity
by
some
in
authority
with
the
queen
and
who
that
was
the
people
answered
by
crying
as
the
royal
corpse
was
carried
to
the
palace
bothwell
lord
bothwell
he
is
the
traitor
chapter
xxxii
all
the
next
day
and
for
many
days
after
consternation
reigned
in
the
streets
of
the
city
and
horror
sat
shuddering
in
all
her
multitudes
stood
in
amazement
from
morning
to
night
around
the
palace
for
the
earl
of
bothwell
was
within
and
still
honoured
with
all
the
homages
due
to
the
greatest
public
trusts
ever
and
anon
a
cry
was
heard
bothwell
is
the
murderer
and
the
multitude
shouted
justice
justice
but
their
cry
was
not
heard
night
after
night
the
trembling
citizens
watched
with
candles
at
their
casements
dreading
some
yet
greater
alarm
and
in
the
stillness
of
the
midnight
hour
a
voice
was
heard
crying
the
queen
and
bothwell
are
the
murderers
and
another
voice
replied
vengeance
vengeance
blood
for
blood
every
morning
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
writings
were
seen
demanding
the
punishment
of
the
regicides
and
the
queen
name
and
the
name
of
bothwell
and
the
names
of
many
more
with
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
at
their
head
were
emblazoned
on
all
sides
as
the
names
of
the
regicides
but
bothwell
with
the
resolute
bravery
of
guilt
in
the
confidence
of
power
heeded
not
the
cry
that
thus
mounted
continually
against
him
to
heaven
and
the
queen
feigned
a
widow
sorrow
the
whole
realm
was
as
when
the
ark
of
the
covenant
of
the
lord
was
removed
from
israel
and
captive
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
the
injured
sought
not
the
redress
of
their
wrongs
even
the
guilty
were
afraid
of
one
another
and
by
the
very
cowardice
of
their
distrust
were
prevented
from
banding
at
a
time
when
they
might
have
rioted
at
will
what
aggravated
these
portents
of
a
kingdom
falling
asunder
was
the
mockery
of
law
and
justice
which
the
court
attempted
those
who
were
accused
of
the
king
death
ruled
the
royal
councils
and
were
greatest
in
the
queen
favour
the
earl
of
bothwell
dictated
the
very
proceedings
by
which
he
was
himself
to
be
brought
to
trial
and
when
the
day
of
trial
arrived
he
came
with
the
pomp
and
retinue
of
a
victorious
conqueror
to
be
acquitted
but
acquitted
as
the
guilty
ever
needs
must
be
whom
no
one
dares
to
accuse
nor
any
witness
hazards
to
appear
against
his
acquittal
served
but
to
prove
his
guilt
and
the
forms
thereof
the
murderous
participation
of
the
queen
thus
though
he
was
assoilzied
in
form
of
law
the
libel
against
him
was
nevertheless
found
proven
by
the
universal
verdict
of
all
men
yet
in
despite
of
the
world
and
even
of
the
conviction
recorded
within
their
own
bosoms
did
the
infatuated
mary
and
that
dreadless
traitor
in
little
more
than
three
months
from
the
era
of
their
crime
rush
into
an
adulterous
marriage
but
of
the
infamies
concerning
the
same
and
of
the
humiliated
state
to
which
poor
scotland
sank
in
consequence
i
must
refer
the
courteous
reader
to
the
histories
and
chronicles
of
the
time
while
i
return
to
the
narrative
of
my
grandfather
when
the
earl
of
bothwell
as
i
have
been
told
by
those
who
heard
him
speak
of
these
deplorable
blots
on
the
scottish
name
had
been
created
duke
of
orkney
the
people
daily
expected
the
marriage
but
instead
of
the
ordinary
ceremonials
used
at
the
marriages
of
former
kings
and
princes
the
queen
and
all
about
her
as
if
they
had
been
smitten
from
on
high
with
some
manifest
and
strange
phrenzy
resolved
as
it
were
in
derision
and
blasphemy
notwithstanding
her
own
and
the
notour
popery
of
the
duke
to
celebrate
their
union
according
to
the
strictest
forms
of
the
protestants
and
john
knox
being
at
the
time
in
the
west
country
his
colleague
master
craig
was
ordered
by
the
queen
in
council
to
publish
the
bans
three
several
sabbaths
in
st
giles
kirk
on
the
morning
of
the
first
appointed
day
my
grandfather
went
thither
a
vast
concourse
of
the
people
were
assembled
and
the
worthy
minister
when
he
rose
in
the
pulpit
with
the
paper
in
his
hand
trembled
and
was
pale
and
for
some
time
unable
to
speak
at
last
he
read
the
names
and
purpose
of
marriage
aloud
and
he
paused
when
he
had
done
so
and
an
awful
solemnity
froze
the
very
spirits
of
the
congregation
he
then
laid
down
the
paper
on
the
pulpit
and
lifting
his
hands
and
raising
his
eyes
cried
with
a
vehement
sadness
of
voice
lord
god
of
the
pure
heavens
and
all
ye
of
the
earth
that
hear
me
i
protest
as
a
minister
of
the
gospel
my
abhorrence
and
detestation
of
this
hideous
and
adulterous
sin
and
i
call
all
the
nobility
and
all
of
the
council
to
remonstrate
with
her
majesty
against
a
step
that
must
cover
her
with
infamy
for
ever
and
ruin
past
all
remede
three
days
did
he
thus
publish
the
bans
and
thrice
in
that
manner
did
he
boldly
proclaim
his
protestation
for
which
he
was
called
before
the
privy
council
where
the
guilty
bothwell
was
sitting
and
being
charged
with
having
exceeded
the
bounds
of
his
commission
he
replied
with
an
apostolic
bravery
my
commission
is
from
the
word
of
god
good
laws
and
natural
reason
to
all
which
this
proposed
marriage
is
obnoxious
the
earl
of
bothwell
there
where
he
sits
knows
that
he
is
an
adulterer
the
divorce
that
he
has
procured
from
his
wife
has
been
by
collusion
and
he
knows
likewise
that
he
has
murdered
the
king
and
guiltily
possessed
himself
of
the
queen
person
yet
notwithstanding
mr
craig
was
suffered
to
depart
even
unmolested
by
the
astonished
and
overawed
bothwell
but
as
i
have
said
the
marriage
was
still
celebrated
and
it
was
the
last
great
crime
of
papistical
device
that
the
lord
suffered
to
see
done
within
the
bounds
of
scotland
for
the
same
night
letters
were
sent
to
the
earl
of
murray
from
divers
of
the
nobility
entreating
him
to
return
forthwith
and
my
grandfather
at
the
incitement
of
the
earl
of
argyle
was
secretly
sent
by
his
patron
glencairn
to
beg
the
friends
of
the
state
and
the
lawful
prince
the
son
whom
the
queen
had
born
to
her
murdered
husband
to
meet
without
delay
at
stirling
accordingly
with
the
flower
of
their
vassals
and
retainers
besides
argyle
and
glencairn
came
many
of
the
nobles
and
having
protested
their
detestation
of
the
conduct
of
the
queen
they
entered
into
a
solemn
league
and
covenant
wherein
they
rehearsed
as
causes
for
their
confederating
against
the
misrule
with
which
the
kingdom
was
so
humbled
that
the
scottish
people
were
abhorred
and
vilipendit
amongst
all
christian
nations
declaring
that
they
would
never
desist
till
they
had
revenged
the
foul
murder
of
the
king
rescued
the
queen
from
her
thraldom
to
the
earl
of
bothwell
and
dissolved
her
ignominious
marriage
the
queen
and
her
regicide
for
he
could
not
be
called
her
husband
were
when
they
heard
of
this
avenging
paction
she
issued
a
bold
proclamation
calling
on
her
insulted
subjects
to
take
arms
in
her
defence
and
she
published
manifestoes
all
lies
she
fled
with
bothwell
from
edinburgh
to
the
castle
of
borthwick
but
scarcely
were
they
within
the
gates
when
the
sough
of
the
rising
storm
obliged
him
to
leave
her
and
the
same
night
in
the
disguise
of
man
apparel
the
queen
of
all
scotland
was
seen
flying
friendless
and
bewildered
to
her
sentenced
paramour
the
covenanting
nobles
in
the
meantime
were
mustering
their
clans
and
their
vassals
and
the
earls
of
morton
and
athol
having
brought
the
instrument
of
the
league
to
edinburgh
the
magistrates
and
signed
the
same
and
taking
the
oaths
issued
instanter
orders
for
the
burghers
to
prepare
themselves
with
arms
and
banners
and
to
man
the
city
walls
the
whole
kingdom
rung
with
the
sound
of
warlike
preparations
and
the
ancient
valour
of
the
scottish
heart
was
blithened
with
the
hope
of
erasing
the
stains
that
a
wicked
government
had
brought
upon
the
honour
of
the
land
meanwhile
the
regicide
and
the
queen
drew
together
what
forces
his
power
could
command
and
her
promises
allure
and
they
advanced
from
dunbar
to
carberry
hill
where
they
encamped
the
army
of
the
covenanters
at
the
same
time
left
edinburgh
to
meet
them
mary
appeared
at
the
head
of
her
troops
but
they
felt
themselves
engaged
in
a
bad
cause
and
refused
to
fight
she
exhorted
them
with
all
the
pith
of
her
eloquence
she
wept
she
implored
she
threatened
and
she
reproached
them
with
cowardice
but
still
they
stood
sullen
to
retreat
in
the
face
of
an
enemy
who
had
already
surrounded
the
hill
on
which
she
stood
was
impracticable
in
this
extremity
she
called
with
a
voice
of
despair
for
kirkcaldy
of
grange
a
brave
man
whom
she
saw
at
the
head
of
the
cavalry
by
whom
she
was
surrounded
and
he
having
halted
his
horse
and
procured
leave
from
his
leaders
advanced
toward
her
bothwell
with
a
few
followers
during
the
interval
quitted
the
field
and
as
soon
as
kirkcaldy
came
up
she
surrendered
herself
to
him
and
was
conducted
by
him
to
the
headquarters
of
the
covenanters
by
whom
she
was
received
with
all
the
wonted
testimonials
of
respect
and
was
assured
if
she
forsook
bothwell
and
governed
her
kingdom
with
honest
councils
they
would
honour
and
obey
her
as
their
sovereign
but
the
common
soldiers
overwhelmed
her
with
reproaches
and
on
the
march
back
to
edinburgh
poured
upon
her
the
most
opprobrious
names
never
was
such
a
sight
seen
my
grandfather
often
said
as
the
return
of
that
abject
princess
to
her
capital
on
the
banner
of
the
league
was
depicted
the
corpse
of
the
murdered
king
her
husband
lying
under
a
tree
with
the
young
prince
his
son
kneeling
before
it
and
the
motto
was
and
revenge
my
cause
o
lord
the
rode
with
it
immediately
before
the
horse
on
which
she
sat
weeping
and
wild
and
covered
with
dust
and
as
often
as
she
raised
her
distracted
eye
the
apparition
of
the
murder
in
the
flag
fluttered
in
her
face
in
vain
she
supplicated
pity
yells
and
howls
were
all
the
answers
she
received
and
volleys
of
execrations
came
from
the
populace
with
burn
her
burn
her
bloody
murderess
let
her
not
live
in
that
condition
she
was
conducted
to
the
provost
house
into
which
she
was
assisted
to
alight
more
dead
than
alive
and
next
morning
she
was
conveyed
a
prisoner
to
lochleven
castle
where
she
was
soon
after
compelled
to
resign
the
crown
to
her
son
and
the
regency
to
the
earl
of
murray
by
whose
great
wisdom
the
reformation
was
established
in
truth
and
holiness
throughout
the
kingdom
though
for
a
season
it
was
again
menaced
when
mary
effected
her
escape
and
dared
the
cause
of
the
lord
to
battle
at
langside
but
of
that
great
day
of
victory
it
becomes
not
me
to
speak
for
it
hath
received
the
blazon
of
many
an
abler
pen
it
is
enough
to
mention
that
my
grandfather
was
there
and
after
the
battle
that
he
returned
with
the
army
to
glasgow
and
was
present
at
the
thanksgiving
the
same
night
he
paid
his
last
respects
to
the
earl
of
murray
who
permitted
him
to
take
away
as
a
trophy
and
memorial
the
gloves
which
his
lordship
had
worn
that
day
in
the
field
and
they
have
ever
since
been
sacredly
preserved
at
quharist
where
they
may
be
still
seen
they
are
of
york
buff
the
palm
of
the
one
for
the
right
hand
is
still
blue
with
the
mark
of
the
sword
hilt
and
the
stool
is
stained
with
the
ink
of
a
letter
which
the
earl
wrote
on
the
field
to
argyle
who
had
joined
the
queen
faction
the
which
letter
it
has
been
thought
caused
the
swithering
of
that
nobleman
in
the
hour
of
the
onset
by
which
providence
gave
the
regent
the
victory
a
conquest
which
established
the
gospel
in
his
native
land
for
ever
chapter
xxxiii
after
the
battle
of
langside
many
of
the
nobles
and
great
personages
of
the
realm
grew
jealous
of
the
good
regent
murray
and
by
their
own
demeanour
caused
him
to
put
on
towards
them
a
reserve
and
coldness
of
deportment
which
they
construed
as
their
feelings
and
fancies
led
them
much
to
his
disadvantage
for
he
was
too
proud
to
court
the
that
he
thought
was
his
due
but
to
all
people
of
a
lower
degree
like
those
in
my
grandfather
station
he
was
ever
the
same
punctual
and
gracious
superior
making
by
the
urbanity
of
his
manner
small
courtesies
recollected
and
spoken
of
as
great
favours
in
so
much
that
being
of
the
whole
commonality
his
memory
long
after
his
fatal
death
was
held
in
great
estimation
among
them
and
his
fame
as
the
sweet
odour
of
many
blessings
few
things
my
grandfather
often
said
gave
him
a
sorer
pang
than
the
base
murder
by
the
hamiltons
of
that
most
eminent
worthy
and
in
all
the
labours
and
business
of
his
long
life
nothing
came
ever
more
pleasant
to
his
thoughts
than
the
remembrance
of
the
part
he
had
himself
in
the
retribution
with
which
their
many
bloody
acts
were
in
the
end
overtaken
and
punished
indeed
as
far
as
concerns
their
guiltiest
instigator
and
kinsman
the
adulterous
antichrist
of
st
andrews
never
was
a
just
vengeance
and
judgment
more
visibly
manifested
as
i
shall
now
with
all
expedient
brevity
rehearse
it
being
the
last
exploit
in
which
my
grandfather
bore
arms
for
the
commonweal
bailie
kilspinnie
of
crail
having
dealings
with
certain
glasgow
merchants
who
sold
plaiding
to
the
highlanders
of
lennox
and
cowal
finding
them
dour
in
payment
owing
as
they
said
to
their
customers
lengthening
their
credit
of
their
own
accord
on
account
of
the
times
the
west
having
been
from
the
battle
of
langside
unwontedly
tranquil
he
in
the
spring
of
came
in
quest
of
his
monies
and
my
grandfather
having
notice
thereof
took
on
behind
him
on
horseback
to
see
her
father
agnes
kilspinnie
who
had
lived
in
his
house
from
the
time
of
his
marriage
to
her
aunt
elspa
ruet
and
it
happened
that
captain
crawford
of
jordanhill
who
was
then
meditating
his
famous
exploit
against
the
castle
of
dumbarton
met
my
grandfather
by
chance
in
the
trongait
and
knowing
some
little
of
him
and
of
the
great
regard
in
which
he
was
held
by
many
noblemen
for
one
of
his
birth
spoke
to
him
cordially
and
asked
him
to
be
of
his
party
assigning
among
other
things
as
a
motive
that
the
great
adversary
of
the
reformation
the
archbishop
of
st
andrews
had
on
account
of
the
doom
and
outlawry
pronounced
upon
him
for
being
accessory
both
to
the
murder
of
king
henry
the
queen
protestant
husband
and
of
the
good
regent
murray
taken
refuge
in
that
redoubtable
fortress
some
concern
for
the
state
of
his
wife
and
young
family
weighed
with
my
grandfather
while
he
was
in
communion
with
jordanhill
but
after
parting
from
him
and
going
back
to
the
saracen
inn
in
the
gallowgait
where
bailie
kilspinnie
and
his
daughter
were
he
had
an
inward
urging
of
the
spirit
moving
him
to
be
of
the
enterprise
on
a
persuasion
as
i
have
heard
him
tell
himself
that
without
he
was
there
something
would
arise
to
balk
the
undertaking
so
he
was
in
consequence
troubled
in
thought
and
held
himself
aloof
from
the
familiar
talk
of
his
friends
all
the
remainder
of
the
day
wishing
that
he
might
be
able
to
overcome
the
thirst
which
captain
crawford
had
bred
within
him
to
join
his
company
bailie
kilspinnie
seeing
him
in
this
perplexity
of
soul
spoke
to
him
as
a
friend
and
searched
to
know
what
had
taken
possession
of
him
and
my
grandfather
partly
moved
by
his
entreaty
and
partly
by
the
thought
of
the
great
palpable
antichrist
of
scotland
who
had
done
the
fireside
such
damage
and
detriment
being
in
a
manner
exposed
to
their
taking
told
him
what
had
been
propounded
by
jordanhill
say
you
so
cried
the
bailie
remembering
the
offence
done
to
his
family
say
you
so
and
that
he
is
in
a
girn
that
wants
but
a
manly
hand
to
grip
him
body
and
soul
o
me
if
the
thing
within
the
power
of
the
arm
of
flesh
he
shall
be
taken
and
brought
to
the
wuddy
if
the
lord
permits
justice
to
be
done
within
the
realm
of
scotland
the
which
bold
and
valorous
breathing
of
the
honest
magistrate
of
crail
kindled
the
smoking
yearnings
of
my
grandfather
into
a
bright
and
blazing
flame
and
he
replied
then
sir
if
you
be
so
minded
i
can
not
perforce
abide
behind
but
will
go
forth
with
you
to
the
battle
and
swither
not
with
the
sword
till
we
have
effected
some
notable
achievement
they
accordingly
went
forthwith
to
captain
crawford
and
proffered
to
him
their
service
and
he
was
gladdened
that
my
grandfather
had
come
to
so
warlike
a
purpose
but
he
looked
sharply
at
the
bailie
and
twice
smiled
to
my
grandfather
as
if
in
doubt
of
his
soldiership
saying
but
gilhaize
since
you
recommend
him
he
must
be
a
good
man
and
true
so
the
same
night
they
set
out
at
dusk
with
a
chosen
troop
and
band
of
not
more
than
two
hundred
men
a
boat
provided
with
ladders
dropped
down
the
river
with
the
tide
to
be
before
them
by
midnight
the
expedition
reached
the
bottom
of
dumbuckhill
where
having
ascertained
that
the
boat
was
arrived
jordanhill
directed
those
aboard
to
keep
her
close
in
with
the
shore
and
move
with
their
march
the
evening
when
they
left
glasgow
was
bright
and
calm
and
the
moon
in
her
first
quarter
shed
her
beautiful
glory
on
mountain
and
tower
and
tree
leading
them
as
with
the
light
of
a
heavenly
torch
and
when
they
reached
the
skirts
of
the
river
it
was
soon
manifest
that
their
enterprise
was
favoured
from
on
high
the
moon
was
by
that
time
set
and
a
thick
mist
came
rolling
from
the
clyde
and
the
leven
and
made
the
night
air
dim
as
well
as
dark
veiling
their
movements
from
all
mortal
eyes
jordanhill
guide
led
them
to
a
part
of
the
rock
which
was
seldom
guarded
and
showed
them
where
to
place
their
ladders
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
the
lord
fleming
the
governor
but
on
account
of
contumelious
usage
had
quitted
it
and
had
been
the
contriver
of
the
scheme
scarcely
was
the
first
ladder
placed
when
the
impatience
of
the
men
brought
it
to
the
ground
but
there
was
a
noise
in
the
ebbing
waters
of
the
clyde
that
drowned
the
accident
of
their
fall
and
prevented
it
from
alarming
the
soldiers
on
the
watch
this
failure
disconcerted
jordanhill
for
a
moment
but
the
guide
fastened
the
ladder
to
the
roots
of
an
ash
tree
which
grew
in
a
cleft
of
the
rock
and
to
the
first
shelf
of
the
precipice
they
all
ascended
in
safety
the
first
ladder
was
then
drawn
up
and
placed
against
the
upper
story
as
it
might
be
called
of
the
rock
reaching
to
the
gap
where
they
could
enter
into
the
fortress
while
another
ladder
was
tied
in
its
place
below
jordanhill
then
ascended
leading
the
way
followed
by
his
men
the
bailie
of
crail
being
before
my
grandfather
they
were
now
at
a
fearful
height
from
the
ground
but
the
mist
was
thick
and
no
one
saw
the
dizzy
eminence
to
which
he
had
attained
it
happened
however
that
just
as
jordanhill
reached
the
summit
and
while
my
grandfather
and
the
bailie
were
about
up
the
ladder
the
mist
below
rolled
away
and
the
stars
above
shone
out
and
the
bailie
casting
his
eyes
downward
was
so
amazed
and
terrified
at
the
eagle
flight
he
had
taken
that
he
began
to
quake
and
tremble
and
could
not
mount
a
step
farther
at
that
juncture
delay
was
death
to
success
it
was
impossible
to
pass
him
to
tumble
him
off
the
ladder
and
let
him
be
dashed
to
pieces
as
some
of
the
men
both
above
and
below
roughly
bade
my
grandfather
do
was
cruel
all
were
at
a
stand
governed
however
by
a
singular
inspiration
my
grandfather
took
off
his
own
and
also
the
bailie
and
fastened
him
with
them
to
the
ladder
by
the
oxters
and
legs
and
then
turning
round
the
ladder
leaving
him
so
fastened
pendent
in
the
air
on
the
lower
side
the
assailants
ascended
over
his
belly
and
courageously
mounted
to
their
perilous
duty
jordanhill
shouted
as
they
mustered
on
the
summit
the
officers
and
soldiers
of
the
garrison
rushed
out
naked
but
sword
in
hand
the
assailants
seized
the
cannon
lord
fleming
the
governor
leaped
the
wall
into
the
boat
that
had
brought
the
scaling
ladders
and
was
rowed
away
the
garrison
thus
deserted
surrendered
and
the
guilty
prelate
was
among
the
prisoners
as
soon
as
order
was
in
some
degree
restored
my
grandfather
went
with
two
other
soldiers
to
where
the
bailie
had
been
left
suspended
and
having
relieved
him
from
his
horror
which
the
breaking
daylight
increased
by
showing
him
the
fearful
height
at
which
he
hung
he
brought
him
to
jordanhill
who
laughing
at
his
disaster
ordered
him
to
be
one
of
the
guard
appointed
to
conduct
the
archbishop
to
stirling
in
that
service
the
worthy
magistrate
proved
more
courageous
and
upbraided
the
prisoner
several
times
on
the
road
for
the
ill
he
had
done
to
him
but
that
traitorous
high
priest
heard
his
taunts
in
silence
for
he
was
a
valiant
and
proud
man
such
indeed
was
his
gallant
bearing
in
the
march
that
the
soldiers
were
won
by
it
to
do
him
homage
as
a
true
knight
and
had
he
been
a
warrior
as
he
was
but
a
priest
it
was
thought
by
many
that
though
both
papist
and
traitor
they
might
have
been
worked
upon
to
set
him
free
to
stirling
however
he
was
carried
and
on
the
fourth
day
from
the
time
he
was
taken
he
was
executed
on
the
gallows
where
notwithstanding
his
guilty
life
he
suffered
with
the
bravery
of
a
gentleman
dying
in
a
righteous
cause
in
so
much
that
the
papists
honoured
his
courage
as
if
it
had
been
the
virtue
of
a
holy
martyr
and
bailie
kilspinnie
all
his
days
never
ceased
to
wonder
how
so
wicked
a
man
could
die
so
well
chapter
xxxiv
having
thus
set
forth
the
main
passages
in
my
grandfather
life
i
should
now
quit
the
public
highway
of
history
and
turn
for
a
time
into
the
pleasant
footpath
of
his
domestic
vineyard
the
plants
whereof
under
his
culture
and
the
pious
waterings
of
elspa
ruet
my
excellent
progenitrix
were
beginning
to
spread
their
green
tendrils
and
goodly
branches
and
to
hang
out
their
clusters
to
the
gracious
sunshine
as
it
were
in
demonstration
to
the
heavens
that
the
labourer
was
no
sluggard
and
as
an
assurance
that
in
due
season
under
its
benign
favour
they
would
gratefully
repay
his
care
with
sweet
fruit
but
there
is
yet
one
thing
to
be
told
which
though
it
may
not
be
regarded
as
germane
to
the
mighty
event
of
the
reformation
grew
so
plainly
out
of
the
signal
catastrophe
related
in
the
foregoing
chapter
that
it
were
to
neglect
the
instruction
mercifully
intended
were
i
not
to
describe
all
its
circumstances
and
particularities
as
they
came
to
pass
accordingly
to
proceed
in
the
winter
after
the
storming
of
dumbarton
castle
widow
ruet
the
mother
of
my
grandmother
hearing
nothing
for
a
long
time
of
her
poor
donsie
daughter
marion
had
from
the
hanging
of
archbishop
hamilton
the
paramour
of
that
misguided
creature
fallen
into
a
melancholy
state
of
moaning
and
inward
grief
in
so
much
that
bailie
kilspinnie
wrote
a
letter
invoking
my
grandfather
to
come
with
his
wife
to
crail
that
they
might
join
together
in
comforting
the
aged
woman
which
work
of
duty
and
of
charity
they
lost
no
time
in
undertaking
carrying
with
them
agnes
kilspinnie
to
see
her
kin
being
minded
both
in
the
going
and
the
coming
to
partake
of
the
feast
of
the
heavenly
and
apostolic
eloquence
of
the
fearless
truths
they
went
by
the
way
of
edinburgh
and
in
going
about
while
there
to
show
agnes
kilspinnie
the
uncos
of
the
town
it
happened
as
they
were
coming
down
from
the
castlehill
in
passing
the
that
she
observed
a
beggar
woman
sitting
on
a
stair
seemingly
in
great
distress
for
her
hands
were
fervently
clasped
and
she
was
swinging
her
body
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
bark
without
a
rudder
on
a
billowy
sea
when
the
winds
of
an
angry
heaven
are
let
loose
upo
what
made
this
forlorn
wretch
the
more
remarkable
was
a
seeming
remnant
of
better
days
in
something
about
herself
besides
the
silken
rags
of
garments
that
had
once
been
costly
for
as
she
from
time
to
time
lifted
her
delicate
hands
aloft
in
her
despairing
ecstasy
the
scrap
of
blanket
which
was
all
her
mantle
fell
back
and
showed
such
lily
and
arms
that
it
was
impossible
to
look
upon
her
without
compassion
and
not
also
to
wonder
from
what
high
and
palmy
estate
she
had
fallen
into
such
abject
poverty
my
grandfather
and
his
wife
with
agnes
stopped
for
a
moment
and
conferred
together
about
what
alms
they
would
offer
to
a
gentlewoman
brought
so
low
when
she
observing
them
came
wildly
towards
them
crying
for
the
mother
of
god
to
save
a
famishing
outcast
from
death
and
perdition
her
frantic
gesture
far
more
than
her
papistical
exclamation
made
their
souls
shudder
and
before
they
had
time
to
reply
she
fell
on
her
knees
and
taking
elspa
by
the
hand
repeated
the
same
vehement
prayer
adding
do
do
even
though
i
be
the
vilest
and
guiltiest
of
womankind
marion
ruet
o
my
sister
o
my
dear
marion
as
wildfully
and
as
wofully
did
my
grandmother
in
that
instant
also
cry
aloud
falling
on
the
neck
and
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
have
burst
for
it
was
indeed
the
bailie
wife
and
the
mother
of
agnes
that
supplicated
for
a
morsel
this
sad
sight
brought
many
persons
around
among
others
a
decent
elderly
carlin
that
kept
a
huxtry
shop
close
by
who
pitifully
invited
them
to
come
from
the
public
causey
into
her
house
and
with
some
difficulty
my
grandfather
removed
the
two
sisters
thither
agnes
kilspinnie
poor
thing
following
like
a
demented
creature
not
even
able
to
drop
a
tear
at
so
meeting
with
her
humiliated
parent
who
from
the
moment
that
she
was
known
could
only
gaze
like
the
effigy
of
some
extraordinary
consternation
carved
in
alabaster
stone
when
they
had
been
some
time
in
the
house
of
old
ursie
firikins
as
the
kind
carlin
was
called
elspa
ruet
all
the
while
weeping
like
a
constant
fountain
and
repeating
marion
marion
with
a
fond
and
sorrowful
tenderness
that
would
allow
her
to
say
no
more
my
grandfather
having
got
a
drink
of
meal
and
water
prepared
gave
it
to
the
famished
outcast
and
she
gradually
recovered
from
her
stupor
for
many
minutes
however
she
sat
still
and
said
nothing
and
when
she
did
speak
it
was
in
a
voice
of
such
misery
of
soul
that
my
grandfather
never
liked
to
tell
what
terrible
thoughts
the
remembrance
of
it
ever
gave
him
i
shall
therefore
not
venture
to
repeat
what
she
said
farther
than
to
mention
that
having
sunk
down
on
her
knees
she
spread
her
hands
aloft
and
exclaimed
ay
the
time
come
now
and
the
words
of
her
prophecy
that
never
ceased
to
dirl
in
my
soul
are
fulfilled
i
will
go
back
to
crail
my
penitence
shall
be
seen
in
my
shame
i
will
go
openly
that
all
may
take
warning
and
before
all
in
the
face
of
day
will
i
confess
the
wrongs
i
hae
done
to
my
gudeman
and
bairns
she
then
rose
and
said
to
her
sister
elspa
ye
hae
heard
my
vow
and
this
very
hour
i
will
begin
my
pilgrimage
some
further
conversation
ensued
in
which
she
told
them
that
she
had
run
a
woful
course
after
the
havock
at
st
andrews
but
though
humbled
to
the
dust
and
almost
perishing
of
hunger
pride
had
still
warsled
with
penitence
and
would
not
let
her
return
to
seek
shelter
from
her
mother
but
at
last
said
she
all
has
now
come
to
pass
and
it
is
meet
i
submit
to
what
is
so
plainly
required
of
me
then
turning
to
her
daughter
she
looked
at
her
for
some
time
with
a
watery
and
inquiring
eye
and
would
have
spoken
but
her
heart
filled
full
and
she
could
only
weep
by
way
of
consolation
my
grandfather
told
her
they
were
then
on
their
way
to
crail
and
that
as
soon
as
they
had
procured
for
her
some
fit
apparel
they
would
take
her
with
them
at
these
words
she
lifted
the
skirt
of
her
ragged
gown
and
looking
at
it
for
a
moment
smiled
as
if
in
contempt
of
all
things
saying
no
this
is
the
livery
of
him
that
i
hae
served
so
weel
it
is
fit
that
my
friends
should
behold
the
coat
of
many
colours
and
the
garment
of
praise
wherewith
he
rewards
all
those
that
serve
him
as
i
hae
done
and
no
admonition
nor
any
affectionate
petition
could
shake
her
sad
purpose
but
said
she
i
ought
not
to
shame
you
on
the
road
and
yet
elspa
at
least
till
the
entrance
of
the
town
let
me
travel
with
you
for
when
i
hae
dreed
my
penance
we
must
part
never
to
meet
again
darkness
and
dule
is
my
portion
now
in
this
world
i
hae
earnt
them
and
it
is
just
that
i
should
enjoy
them
they
are
my
ain
conquest
bought
wi
the
price
of
everything
but
my
soul
and
wha
kens
but
for
this
meeting
that
it
might
hae
been
bartered
away
too
in
nothing
however
of
all
that
then
passed
was
there
anything
which
so
moved
the
tranquil
heart
of
my
grandfather
as
the
looks
which
from
time
to
time
the
desolate
woman
cast
at
her
daughter
fain
she
seemed
to
speak
and
to
catch
her
in
her
arms
but
ever
and
anon
the
sense
of
her
own
condition
came
upon
her
and
she
began
to
weep
crying
no
no
i
darena
do
that
i
darena
even
mysel
to
a
parent
privilege
after
what
i
hae
done
the
poor
lassie
sat
unable
to
make
any
answer
but
at
last
in
a
timid
manner
she
took
her
mother
softly
by
the
hand
and
the
fond
and
lowly
penitent
for
a
few
moments
allowed
it
to
linger
in
her
grip
willing
to
have
left
it
there
but
suddenly
stung
by
her
conscience
she
snatched
it
away
and
again
broke
out
into
piercing
lamentations
and
confessions
of
unworthiness
meanwhile
the
charitable
ursie
firikins
had
made
ready
a
mess
of
porridge
and
the
mournful
magdalen
being
soothed
and
consoled
was
persuaded
to
partake
and
afterwards
when
they
had
sat
some
time
and
the
crowd
which
had
gathered
out
of
doors
in
the
street
was
dispersed
my
grandfather
went
to
his
lodgings
and
having
paid
his
lawin
returned
to
the
two
sisters
and
agnes
kilspinnie
and
they
all
walked
to
the
shore
of
leith
together
where
they
found
a
boat
going
to
kinghorn
into
which
they
embarked
and
having
slept
there
they
hired
a
cart
to
take
them
to
crail
next
morning
everyone
who
saw
them
wondering
at
the
dejected
and
ruinous
appearance
of
the
penitent
the
particulars
however
of
their
journey
and
of
her
reception
in
her
native
place
will
furnish
matter
for
another
chapter
chapter
xxxv
when
they
came
within
a
mile
of
the
town
where
a
small
public
stood
that
wayfaring
men
were
wont
to
stop
and
refresh
themselves
at
my
grandfather
urged
the
disconsolate
marion
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
kinghorn
without
speaking
a
single
word
to
alight
from
the
cart
and
remain
there
till
the
cloud
of
night
when
she
might
go
to
her
unafflicted
by
the
gaze
of
the
pitiless
multitude
to
this
at
first
she
made
no
answer
but
leaping
out
of
the
cart
and
standing
still
for
a
moment
she
looked
wistfully
at
her
sister
and
daughter
and
then
began
to
weep
crying
gang
ye
awa
and
no
mind
me
ye
canna
thole
and
oughtna
to
share
what
i
maun
bear
and
i
never
break
another
vow
so
in
the
face
o
day
and
of
a
people
constrained
to
enter
crail
first
to
confess
my
guilt
at
the
door
of
the
honest
man
and
his
bairns
that
i
hae
sae
disgraced
and
syne
to
beg
my
mother
to
take
in
the
limmer
that
was
scofft
frae
door
to
door
till
the
blessed
time
when
ye
were
sent
to
stop
me
laying
desperate
hands
on
mysel
elspa
remonstrated
with
her
for
some
time
but
she
was
not
to
be
entreated
my
guilt
and
my
shamelessness
were
public
said
she
and
it
is
meet
that
the
world
should
behold
what
hae
been
the
wages
i
hae
earnt
and
the
depth
of
the
humiliation
to
which
my
vain
and
proud
heart
has
been
brought
so
go
ye
on
wi
your
gudeman
and
agnes
and
let
me
come
by
mysel
no
marion
replied
her
sister
that
be
i
no
let
you
do
that
if
you
will
make
sic
a
pilgrimage
i
bear
you
company
for
i
can
be
ashamed
nor
mortified
in
being
wi
you
when
ye
are
seeking
again
the
path
of
righteousness
that
ye
were
sae
to
quit
say
nae
i
was
say
naething
to
gar
me
think
less
o
my
fault
than
i
should
there
was
nae
beguiler
but
my
ain
vain
and
sinful
nature
her
daughter
who
had
all
this
time
stood
silent
with
the
tear
in
her
then
said
i
gang
wi
you
mother
too
mother
o
agnes
kilspinnie
dinna
sae
wrang
yoursel
and
your
honest
father
as
to
ca
the
like
o
me
mother
but
did
ye
say
ye
would
come
wi
me
and
she
dropped
vehemently
on
her
knees
and
spreading
her
arms
to
the
skies
cried
out
with
a
loud
and
wild
voice
god
god
is
thy
goodness
so
great
that
thou
canst
already
vouchsafe
to
me
a
mercy
like
this
seeing
her
so
bent
on
going
into
the
town
in
her
miserable
estate
and
his
wife
and
her
daughter
so
mindit
to
go
with
her
my
grandfather
said
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
run
forward
and
prepare
her
mother
for
her
coming
so
he
left
them
and
hastened
into
the
town
thinking
they
would
come
in
the
cart
but
when
he
was
gone
marion
still
in
the
hope
she
might
get
her
sister
and
daughter
dissuaded
from
accompanying
her
told
them
that
she
was
resolved
to
go
on
her
bare
feet
which
however
made
them
in
pity
still
adhere
the
more
closely
to
their
determination
and
having
paid
the
kinghorn
man
for
his
cart
the
three
set
forward
together
elspa
on
the
right
hand
and
agnes
on
the
left
hand
of
the
lowly
penitent
in
the
meantime
my
grandfather
hastened
to
the
dwelling
of
widow
ruet
his
to
tell
her
who
was
coming
and
to
prepare
her
aged
mind
for
the
sore
shock
for
though
she
was
a
sectarian
of
the
roman
seed
she
was
nevertheless
a
most
devout
character
and
abided
more
in
the
errors
of
her
religion
because
she
thought
herself
too
old
to
learn
a
new
faith
than
from
that
obstinacy
of
spirit
which
in
those
days
so
abounded
in
the
breasts
of
the
papisticals
the
news
was
at
first
as
glad
tidings
to
the
humane
old
woman
but
every
now
and
then
she
began
to
start
and
to
listen
and
a
tear
fell
from
her
eye
when
she
heard
the
voice
of
anyone
talking
in
the
street
or
the
sound
of
a
foot
passing
she
hurried
to
the
window
and
looked
hastily
out
the
struggle
within
her
was
great
and
it
grew
every
minute
stronger
and
stronger
and
after
walking
very
wofully
divers
times
across
the
floor
she
went
and
closed
the
shutters
of
her
window
and
sitting
down
gave
full
vent
to
her
grief
in
that
state
she
had
not
been
long
when
the
sough
of
a
din
gathering
at
a
distance
was
heard
mother
of
christ
she
cried
starting
up
clapping
her
hands
mother
of
jesus
thou
hast
seen
the
fruit
of
thy
womb
exposed
to
ignominy
by
thine
own
agonies
in
that
hour
i
implore
thy
support
o
blessed
mary
thy
sorrow
was
light
compared
to
my
burden
for
thy
bairn
was
holy
and
meek
and
kind
and
without
sin
but
thou
hast
known
what
it
was
to
sit
by
thy
baby
sleeping
in
its
innocence
thou
hast
known
what
it
was
to
love
it
for
the
very
troubles
it
then
gave
thee
by
the
remembrance
of
that
sweet
watching
and
care
o
pity
me
and
help
me
to
receive
my
erring
bairn
my
grandfather
could
not
stand
her
lament
and
ejaculations
and
hearing
the
sound
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
he
went
out
of
the
house
to
see
if
his
presence
might
be
any
protection
but
the
sight
he
saw
was
even
more
sorrowful
than
the
aged
mother
grief
instead
of
the
cart
in
which
he
expected
to
see
the
women
he
beheld
them
coming
along
side
by
side
together
attended
by
a
great
multitude
doors
and
windows
flew
open
as
they
came
along
and
old
and
young
looked
out
many
cried
she
has
been
well
for
her
shame
some
laughed
and
the
young
turned
aside
their
heads
to
hide
their
tears
among
others
that
ran
from
the
to
look
in
the
face
of
marion
still
beautiful
though
faded
but
shining
with
something
brighter
than
beauty
there
was
a
little
boy
that
went
up
close
to
her
and
took
her
by
the
hand
without
speaking
and
led
her
along
he
was
her
own
son
but
still
she
moved
not
her
solemn
heavenward
eye
though
a
universal
sobbing
burst
from
ail
the
multitude
and
my
grandfather
at
the
piteous
pageantry
was
no
longer
able
to
remain
master
of
his
feelings
seeing
however
that
the
mournful
actors
therein
were
going
on
towards
bailie
kilspinnie
and
not
intending
to
stop
as
he
expected
they
would
at
widow
ruet
door
he
ran
forward
to
warn
his
old
friend
but
in
this
he
was
too
late
some
one
had
been
already
there
and
he
found
the
poor
man
with
his
three
other
children
standing
at
the
door
seemingly
utterly
at
a
loss
to
know
what
his
duty
should
be
nor
was
my
grandfather
in
any
condition
of
mind
to
help
him
with
advice
at
that
juncture
the
multitude
came
rushing
on
before
the
women
and
halted
in
front
of
the
bailie
house
for
seeing
him
and
his
bairns
they
were
taught
by
some
sense
of
gentle
sympathy
to
divide
and
retire
to
a
distance
leaving
an
open
and
silent
space
for
the
penitent
to
go
forward
when
agnes
kilspinnie
and
her
brother
saw
their
father
and
brother
and
sisters
at
the
door
they
quitted
their
mother
and
joined
them
as
if
instructed
by
an
instinct
while
she
slowly
approached
elspa
ruet
who
had
hitherto
maintained
a
serene
and
resigned
composure
of
countenance
was
so
moved
at
this
sad
spectacle
that
my
grandfather
seeing
her
distress
stepped
out
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
and
supported
her
from
falling
she
was
so
faint
with
anguish
of
heart
in
the
same
moment
with
a
look
that
struck
awe
and
consternation
into
every
one
around
marion
stepped
on
towards
her
husband
and
children
and
gazed
at
them
and
was
dropping
on
her
knees
when
the
bailie
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
if
he
would
have
carried
her
into
the
house
but
he
faltered
in
his
purpose
and
casting
his
eyes
on
the
five
weans
whom
she
had
so
deserted
he
unloosed
his
embrace
and
gathering
them
before
him
went
in
and
shut
the
door
the
multitude
uttered
a
fearful
sough
elspa
ruet
roused
by
it
rushed
from
my
grandfather
towards
her
sister
and
stooping
tried
to
raise
her
up
poor
marion
still
kneeling
looked
around
to
the
people
who
stood
all
as
still
as
mourners
at
an
interment
and
her
dark
ringlets
falling
loose
made
her
pale
face
appear
of
an
unearthly
fairness
she
seemed
as
if
she
would
have
said
something
to
her
sister
who
had
clasped
her
by
the
hand
but
litherly
swinging
backwards
she
laid
her
head
down
on
her
husband
threshold
and
gave
a
heavy
sigh
and
died
chapter
xxxvi
the
burial
of
marion
ruet
was
decently
attended
by
bailie
kilspinnie
and
all
his
family
and
though
he
did
not
carry
the
head
himself
he
yet
ordered
their
eldest
son
to
do
so
because
whatever
her
faults
had
been
she
was
still
the
youth
mother
and
my
grandfather
with
his
wife
having
spent
some
time
after
with
their
friends
at
crail
returned
homeward
by
themselves
passing
over
to
edinburgh
that
they
might
taste
once
more
of
the
elixir
of
salvation
as
dispensed
by
john
knox
who
had
been
for
some
time
in
a
complaining
way
and
it
was
by
many
thought
that
the
end
of
his
preaching
was
drawing
nigh
it
happened
that
the
dreadful
tidings
of
the
murder
of
the
protestants
in
france
by
the
command
of
the
accursed
king
reached
edinburgh
in
the
night
before
my
grandfather
and
wife
returned
thither
and
he
used
to
speak
of
the
consternation
that
they
found
reigning
in
the
city
when
they
arrived
there
as
a
thing
very
awful
to
think
of
every
shop
was
shut
and
every
window
closed
for
it
was
the
usage
in
those
days
when
death
was
in
a
house
to
close
all
the
windows
so
that
the
appearance
of
the
town
was
as
if
for
the
obduracy
of
their
idolatrous
sovereign
the
destroying
angel
had
slain
all
the
and
that
a
dead
body
was
then
lying
in
every
family
there
was
also
a
terrifying
solemnity
in
the
streets
for
though
they
were
as
if
all
the
people
had
come
forth
in
panic
and
sad
wonderment
many
were
clothed
in
black
and
there
was
a
funereal
stillness
a
dismal
sense
of
calamity
that
hushed
the
voices
of
men
and
friends
meeting
one
another
lifted
their
hands
and
shuddering
passed
by
without
speaking
my
grandfather
saw
but
one
between
leith
wynd
and
the
door
of
the
house
in
the
lawnmarket
where
he
proposed
to
lodge
that
wore
a
smile
and
it
was
not
of
pleasure
but
of
avarice
counting
its
gains
the
man
was
one
hans
berghen
an
armourer
that
had
feathered
his
nest
in
the
raids
of
the
war
with
the
queen
regent
he
was
a
norman
by
birth
and
had
learnt
the
tempering
of
steel
in
germany
in
his
youth
he
had
been
in
the
imperator
service
and
had
likewise
worked
in
the
arsenal
of
venetia
some
said
he
was
perfected
in
his
trade
by
the
infidel
at
constantinopolis
but
however
this
might
be
no
man
of
that
time
was
more
famous
among
roisters
and
for
the
edge
and
metal
of
his
weapons
than
that
same
blasphemous
incomer
who
thought
of
nothing
but
the
greed
of
gain
whether
by
dule
to
protestant
or
papist
so
that
the
sight
of
his
visage
blithened
with
satisfaction
was
to
my
grandfather
who
knew
him
well
by
repute
as
an
omen
of
portentous
aspect
for
two
days
the
city
continued
in
that
dismal
state
and
on
the
third
which
was
sabbath
the
churches
were
so
filled
that
my
grandmother
being
then
in
a
tender
condition
did
not
venture
to
enter
the
high
kirk
where
the
reformer
was
waited
for
by
many
thirsty
and
languishing
souls
from
an
early
hour
in
the
morning
who
desired
to
hear
what
he
would
say
concerning
the
dark
deeds
that
had
been
done
in
france
she
therefore
returned
to
the
lawnmarket
but
my
grandfather
worked
his
way
into
the
heart
of
the
crowd
where
he
had
not
long
been
when
a
murmur
announced
that
master
knox
was
coming
and
soon
after
he
entered
the
kirk
he
had
now
the
appearance
of
great
age
and
weakness
and
he
walked
with
slow
and
tottering
steps
wearing
a
virl
of
fur
round
his
neck
and
a
staff
in
one
hand
godlie
richie
ballanden
his
man
holding
him
up
by
the
oxter
and
when
he
came
to
the
foot
of
the
pulpit
richie
by
the
help
of
another
servant
that
followed
with
the
book
lifted
him
up
the
steps
into
it
where
he
was
seemingly
so
exhausted
that
he
was
obligated
to
rest
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
no
man
who
had
never
seen
him
before
could
have
thought
that
one
so
frail
would
have
had
ability
to
have
given
out
even
the
psalm
but
when
he
began
the
spirit
descended
upon
him
and
he
was
so
kindled
that
at
last
his
voice
became
as
awful
as
the
thunders
of
wrath
and
his
arm
was
strengthened
as
with
the
strength
of
a
champion
the
kirk
dirled
to
the
foundations
the
hearts
of
his
hearers
shook
till
the
earth
of
their
sins
was
shaken
clean
from
them
and
he
appeared
in
the
wirlwind
of
inspiration
as
if
his
spirit
was
mounting
like
the
prophet
elijah
in
a
fiery
chariot
immediately
to
the
gates
of
heaven
his
discourse
was
of
the
children
of
bethlehem
slain
by
herod
and
he
spoke
of
the
dreadful
sound
of
a
bell
and
a
trumpet
heard
suddenly
in
the
midnight
hour
when
all
were
fast
bound
and
lying
defenceless
in
the
fetters
of
sleep
he
described
the
dreadful
knocking
at
the
doors
the
bursting
in
of
men
with
drawn
swords
how
babies
were
harled
by
the
arms
from
their
mothers
beds
and
bosoms
and
dashed
to
death
upon
the
marble
floors
he
told
of
parents
that
stood
in
the
porches
of
their
houses
and
made
themselves
the
doors
that
the
slayers
were
obliged
to
hew
in
pieces
before
they
could
enter
in
he
pictured
the
women
flying
along
the
street
in
the
nakedness
of
the
bedchamber
with
their
infants
in
their
arms
and
how
the
ruffians
of
the
accursed
king
knowing
their
prey
by
their
cries
ran
after
them
caught
the
mother
by
the
hair
and
the
bairn
by
the
throat
and
in
one
act
flung
the
innocent
to
the
stones
and
trampled
out
its
life
then
he
paused
and
said
in
a
soft
and
thankful
voice
that
in
the
horrors
of
bethlehem
there
was
still
much
mercy
for
the
idolatrous
dread
of
herod
prompted
him
to
slay
but
young
children
whose
blameless
lives
were
to
their
weeping
parents
an
assurance
of
their
acceptance
into
heaven
what
then
he
cried
are
we
to
think
of
that
night
and
of
that
king
and
of
that
people
among
whom
by
whom
and
with
whom
the
commissioned
murderer
twisted
his
grip
in
the
fugitive
old
man
grey
hairs
to
draw
back
his
head
that
the
knife
might
the
surer
reach
his
heart
with
what
eyes
being
already
blinded
with
weeping
shall
we
turn
to
that
city
where
the
withered
hands
of
the
grandmother
were
deemed
as
weapons
of
war
by
the
strong
and
slaughterer
whose
sword
was
owre
vehemently
used
for
a
the
feckless
remnant
of
life
it
had
to
cut
but
deaths
like
these
were
brief
and
blessed
compared
to
other
things
which
heaven
be
praised
i
have
not
the
power
to
describe
and
which
among
this
protestant
congregation
i
trust
there
is
not
one
able
to
imagine
or
who
trying
to
conceive
descries
but
in
the
dark
and
misty
vision
the
pains
of
mangled
mothers
babes
untimely
and
unquickened
cast
on
the
and
into
the
troughs
of
swine
of
hooks
fastened
into
the
mouths
and
driven
through
the
cheeks
of
brave
men
whose
arms
are
tied
with
cords
behind
as
they
are
dragged
into
the
rivers
to
drown
by
those
who
durst
not
in
fair
battle
endure
the
lightning
of
their
eyes
o
herod
herod
of
judea
thy
name
is
hereafter
bright
for
in
thy
bloody
business
thou
wast
thyself
nowhere
to
be
seen
in
the
vouts
and
abysses
of
thy
unstained
palace
thou
hidst
thyself
from
the
eye
of
history
and
perhaps
humanely
sat
covering
thine
ears
with
thy
hands
to
shut
out
the
sound
of
the
wail
and
woe
around
thee
but
this
herod
let
me
not
call
him
by
so
humane
a
name
no
let
all
the
trumpets
of
justice
sound
his
own
to
everlasting
infamy
charles
the
ninth
of
france
and
let
his
ambassador
that
is
here
aye
yet
yet
to
this
time
audaciously
in
this
christian
land
let
him
tell
his
master
that
sentence
has
been
pronounced
against
him
in
scotland
that
the
divine
vengeance
will
never
depart
from
him
or
his
house
until
repentance
has
ensued
and
atonement
been
made
in
their
own
race
that
his
name
will
remain
a
blot
a
blot
of
blood
a
stain
never
to
be
effaced
a
thing
to
be
pronounced
with
a
curse
by
all
posterity
and
that
none
proceeding
from
his
loins
shall
ever
enjoy
his
kingdom
in
peace
the
preacher
on
saying
these
prophetic
words
paused
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
upwards
he
stood
some
time
silent
and
then
clasping
his
hands
together
exclaimed
with
fear
and
trembling
upon
him
lord
lord
thy
will
be
done
many
thought
that
he
had
then
received
some
great
apocalypse
for
it
was
observed
of
all
men
that
he
was
never
after
like
the
man
he
had
once
been
but
highly
and
holily
elevated
above
earthly
cares
and
considerations
saving
those
only
of
his
ministry
and
which
he
hastened
to
close
he
was
as
one
that
no
longer
had
trust
portion
or
interest
in
this
temporal
world
which
in
less
than
two
months
after
he
bade
farewell
and
was
translated
to
a
better
yes
to
a
better
for
assuredly
if
there
is
aught
in
this
life
that
may
be
regarded
as
the
symbols
of
infeftment
to
the
inheritance
of
heaven
the
labours
and
ministration
of
john
knox
were
testimonies
that
he
had
verily
received
the
yird
and
stane
of
an
heritage
on
high
chapter
xxxvii
shortly
after
my
grandfather
had
returned
with
his
wife
to
their
quiet
dwelling
at
quharist
on
the
garnock
side
he
began
in
the
course
of
the
winter
following
to
suffer
an
occasional
pang
in
that
part
of
his
body
which
was
damaged
by
the
fall
he
got
in
rugging
down
the
virgin
mary
out
of
her
niche
in
the
idolatrous
abbeykirk
of
kilwinning
and
the
anguish
of
his
suffering
grew
to
such
an
head
by
candlemas
that
he
was
obligated
to
send
for
his
old
acquaintance
dominick
callender
who
had
after
his
marriage
with
the
regenerate
nun
settled
as
a
doctor
of
physic
in
the
godly
town
of
irvine
but
for
many
a
day
all
the
skill
and
medicamenting
of
doctor
callender
did
him
little
good
till
nature
had
of
her
own
accord
worked
out
the
root
of
the
evil
in
the
shape
of
a
sklinter
of
bone
still
though
the
wound
then
closed
it
never
was
a
sound
part
and
he
continued
in
consequence
a
lamiter
for
life
yet
were
his
days
greatly
prolonged
beyond
the
common
lot
of
man
for
he
lived
till
he
was
years
seven
months
and
four
days
old
and
his
end
at
last
was
but
a
pleasant
translation
from
the
bodily
to
the
spiritual
life
for
some
days
before
the
close
he
was
calm
and
cheerful
rehearsing
to
the
neighbours
that
came
to
speer
for
him
many
things
like
those
of
which
i
have
spoken
herein
towards
the
evening
a
serene
drowsiness
fell
upon
him
like
the
snow
that
falleth
in
silence
and
froze
all
his
temporal
faculties
in
so
gentle
a
manner
that
it
could
not
be
said
he
knew
what
it
was
to
die
being
as
it
were
carried
in
the
downy
arms
of
sleep
to
the
portal
door
of
death
where
all
the
pains
and
terrors
that
guard
the
same
were
hushed
and
stood
mute
around
as
he
was
softly
received
in
no
doubt
there
was
something
of
a
providential
design
in
the
singular
prolongation
of
such
a
pious
and
a
blameless
life
for
through
it
the
possessor
became
a
blessed
mean
of
sowing
in
the
hearts
of
his
children
and
neighbours
the
seeds
of
those
sacred
principles
which
afterwards
made
them
stand
firm
in
their
religious
integrity
when
they
were
so
grievously
tried
for
myself
i
was
too
young
being
scant
of
eight
years
when
he
departed
to
know
the
worth
of
those
precious
things
which
he
had
treasured
in
the
garnel
of
his
spirit
for
unto
the
lord
and
therefore
though
i
often
heard
him
speak
of
the
riddling
wherewith
that
mighty
husbandman
of
the
reformation
john
knox
riddled
the
truths
of
the
gospel
from
the
errors
of
papistry
i
am
bound
to
say
that
his
own
exceeding
venerable
appearance
and
the
visions
of
past
events
which
the
eloquence
of
his
traditions
called
up
to
my
young
fancy
worked
deeper
and
more
thoroughly
into
my
nature
than
the
reasons
and
motives
which
guided
and
governed
many
of
his
other
disciples
but
before
proceeding
with
my
own
story
it
is
meet
that
i
should
still
tell
the
courteous
reader
some
few
things
wherein
my
father
bore
a
part
a
man
of
very
austere
character
and
of
a
most
godly
though
as
some
said
rather
of
a
stubbornly
affection
for
the
forms
of
worship
which
had
been
established
by
john
knox
and
the
pious
worthies
of
his
times
he
was
withal
a
christian
albeit
more
ready
for
a
raid
than
subtle
in
argument
he
had
like
all
who
knew
the
old
people
his
parents
a
reverence
for
them
and
spoke
of
the
patriarchs
with
whom
of
old
the
lord
was
wont
to
hold
communion
as
more
favoured
of
him
than
david
or
solomon
or
any
other
princes
or
kings
when
he
was
very
young
not
passing
as
i
have
heard
him
often
tell
more
than
six
or
seven
years
of
age
he
was
taken
along
with
his
brethren
by
my
grandfather
to
see
the
signing
at
irvine
of
the
covenant
with
which
in
the
lowering
time
of
the
spanish
armada
king
james
the
son
of
mary
together
with
all
the
reformed
bound
themselves
in
solemn
compact
to
uphold
the
protestant
religion
afterwards
when
he
saw
the
country
rise
in
arms
and
heard
of
the
ward
and
watch
and
the
beacons
ready
on
the
hills
his
imagination
was
kindled
with
some
dreadful
conceit
of
the
armada
and
he
thought
it
could
be
nothing
less
than
some
awful
and
horrible
creature
sent
from
the
shores
of
perdition
to
devour
the
whole
land
the
image
he
had
thus
framed
in
his
fears
haunted
him
continually
and
night
after
night
he
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
its
talons
of
brass
and
wings
of
thunder
and
nostrils
flaming
fire
and
the
iron
teeth
with
which
it
was
to
grind
and
gnash
the
bodies
and
bones
of
all
protestants
in
so
much
that
his
parents
were
concerned
for
the
health
of
his
mind
and
wist
not
what
to
do
to
appease
the
terrors
of
his
visions
at
last
however
the
great
judith
of
the
protestant
cause
queen
elizabeth
of
england
being
enabled
to
drive
a
nail
into
the
head
of
that
holofernes
of
the
idolaters
and
many
of
the
host
of
ships
having
been
plunged
by
the
right
arm
of
the
tempest
into
the
depths
of
the
seas
and
scattered
by
the
breath
of
the
storm
like
froth
over
the
ocean
it
happened
that
one
morning
about
the
end
of
july
a
cry
arose
that
a
huge
galley
of
the
armada
was
driven
on
the
rocks
at
pencorse
and
all
the
shire
of
ayr
hastened
to
the
spot
to
behold
and
witness
her
shipwreck
and
overthrow
among
others
my
grandfather
with
his
three
eldest
sons
went
leaving
my
father
at
home
but
his
horrors
grew
to
such
a
passion
of
fear
that
his
mother
the
calm
and
pious
elspa
ruet
resolved
to
take
him
thither
likewise
and
to
give
him
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
that
the
dreadful
armada
was
but
a
navy
of
vessels
like
the
ship
which
was
cast
upon
the
shore
by
this
prudent
thought
of
her
when
he
arrived
at
the
spot
his
apprehensions
were
soothed
but
his
mind
had
ever
after
a
strange
habitude
of
forming
wild
and
wonderful
images
of
every
danger
whereof
the
scope
and
nature
was
not
very
clearly
discerned
and
which
continued
with
him
till
the
end
of
his
days
soon
after
the
death
of
my
grandfather
he
had
occasion
to
go
into
edinburgh
anent
some
matter
of
legacy
that
had
fallen
to
us
through
the
decease
of
an
uncle
of
my
mother
a
in
the
canongate
and
on
his
arrival
there
he
found
men
minds
in
a
sore
fever
concerning
the
rash
councils
wherewith
king
charles
the
first
then
reigning
was
mindit
to
interfere
with
the
pure
worship
of
god
and
to
enact
a
part
in
the
kirk
of
scotland
little
short
of
the
papistical
domination
of
the
roman
antichrist
to
all
men
this
was
startling
tidings
but
to
my
father
it
was
an
enormity
that
fired
his
blood
and
spirit
with
the
fierceness
of
a
furnace
and
it
happened
that
he
lodged
with
a
friend
of
ours
one
janet
geddes
a
most
pious
woman
who
had
suffered
great
molestation
in
her
worldly
substance
from
certain
endeavours
for
the
restorations
of
the
horns
of
the
mitre
and
the
prelatic
buskings
with
which
that
meddling
and
fantastical
bodie
king
james
the
sixth
would
fain
have
buskit
and
disguised
the
sober
simplicity
of
gospel
ordinances
no
two
persons
could
be
more
heartily
in
unison
upon
any
point
of
controversy
than
was
my
worthy
father
and
janet
geddes
concerning
the
enormities
that
would
of
a
necessity
ensue
from
the
papistical
pretensions
and
unrighteous
usurpation
of
king
charles
and
they
sat
crooning
and
lamenting
together
all
the
saturday
afternoon
and
night
about
the
woes
of
idolatry
that
were
darkening
again
over
scotland
no
doubt
there
was
both
reason
and
piety
in
their
fears
but
in
the
method
of
their
sorrow
from
what
i
have
known
of
my
father
earnest
and
simple
character
i
redde
there
might
be
some
lack
of
the
decorum
of
wisdom
but
be
this
as
it
may
they
heated
the
zeal
of
one
another
to
a
pitch
of
great
fervour
and
next
morning
the
sabbath
they
went
together
to
the
high
kirk
of
st
giles
to
see
what
the
power
of
an
infatuated
government
would
dare
to
do
the
kirk
was
filled
to
its
uttermost
bunkers
my
father
however
got
for
janet
geddes
she
being
an
aged
woman
a
stool
near
the
skirts
of
the
pulpit
but
nothing
happened
to
cause
any
disturbance
till
the
godly
mr
patrick
henderson
had
made
an
end
of
the
morning
prayer
when
he
said
with
tears
in
his
eyes
with
reference
to
the
liturgy
which
was
then
to
be
promulgated
adieu
good
people
for
i
think
this
is
the
last
time
of
my
saying
prayers
in
this
kirk
and
the
congregation
being
much
moved
thereat
many
wept
no
sooner
had
mr
henderson
retired
than
master
ramsay
that
horn
of
the
beast
which
was
called
the
dean
of
edinburgh
appeared
in
the
pulpit
in
the
pomp
of
his
abominations
and
began
to
read
the
liturgy
at
the
first
words
of
which
janet
geddes
was
so
transported
with
indignation
that
starting
from
her
stool
she
made
it
fly
whirring
at
his
head
as
she
cried
villain
dost
thou
say
the
mass
at
my
lug
then
such
an
uproar
began
as
had
not
been
witnessed
since
the
destruction
of
the
idols
the
women
screaming
and
clapping
their
hands
in
terrification
as
if
the
legions
of
the
evil
one
had
been
let
loose
upon
them
and
the
men
crying
aloud
antichrist
antichrist
down
wi
the
pope
and
all
exhortation
to
quiet
them
was
drowned
in
the
din
such
was
the
beginning
of
those
troubles
in
the
church
and
state
so
wantonly
provoked
by
the
weak
and
wicked
policy
of
the
first
king
charles
and
which
in
the
end
brought
himself
to
an
ignominious
death
and
such
the
cause
of
that
solemn
league
and
covenant
to
which
in
my
green
years
my
father
soon
after
his
return
home
took
me
to
be
a
party
and
to
which
i
have
been
enabled
to
adhere
with
unerring
constancy
till
the
glorious
purpose
of
it
has
all
been
fulfilled
and
accomplished
chapter
xxxviii
when
my
father
returned
home
my
mother
and
all
the
family
were
grieved
to
see
his
sad
and
altered
looks
we
gathered
around
him
and
she
thought
he
had
failed
to
get
the
legacy
and
comforted
him
by
saying
they
had
hitherto
fen
without
it
and
so
might
they
still
do
to
her
tender
condolements
he
however
made
no
answer
but
taking
a
leathern
bag
with
the
money
in
it
out
of
his
bosom
he
flung
it
on
the
table
saying
what
care
i
for
this
world
trash
when
the
ark
of
the
lord
is
taken
from
israel
which
to
hear
daunted
the
hearts
of
all
present
and
then
he
told
us
after
some
time
what
was
doing
on
the
part
of
the
king
to
bring
in
the
worship
of
the
beast
again
rehearsing
with
many
circumstances
the
consternation
and
sorrow
and
rage
and
lamentations
that
he
had
witnessed
in
edinburgh
i
who
was
the
ninth
of
his
ten
children
and
then
not
passing
nine
years
old
was
thrilled
with
an
unspeakable
fear
and
all
the
dreadful
things
which
i
had
heard
my
grandfather
tell
of
the
tribulations
of
his
time
came
upon
my
spirit
like
visions
of
the
visible
scene
and
i
began
to
weep
with
an
exceeding
sorrow
in
so
much
that
my
father
was
amazed
and
caressed
me
and
thanked
heaven
that
one
so
young
in
his
house
felt
as
a
protestant
child
should
feel
in
an
epoch
of
such
calamity
it
was
then
late
in
the
afternoon
towards
the
gloaming
and
having
partaken
of
some
refreshment
my
father
took
the
big
bible
from
the
and
after
a
prayer
uttered
in
great
heaviness
of
spirit
he
read
a
portion
of
the
revelations
concerning
the
vials
and
the
woes
expounding
the
same
like
a
preacher
and
we
were
all
filled
with
anxieties
and
terrors
some
of
the
younger
members
trembled
with
the
thought
that
the
last
day
was
surely
at
hand
next
morning
a
sough
and
rumour
of
that
solemn
venting
of
christian
indignation
which
had
been
manifested
at
edinburgh
having
reached
our
and
the
neighbours
hearing
of
my
father
return
many
of
them
came
at
night
to
our
house
to
hear
the
news
and
it
was
a
meeting
that
none
present
thereat
could
ever
after
forget
well
do
i
mind
everything
as
if
it
had
happened
but
yestreen
i
was
sitting
on
a
laigh
stool
at
the
fireside
between
the
and
the
of
old
nanse
snoddie
my
mother
aunty
a
godly
woman
that
in
her
eild
we
took
care
of
and
as
young
and
old
came
in
the
salutation
was
in
silence
as
of
guests
coming
to
a
burial
the
first
was
ebenezer
muir
an
aged
man
whose
grandson
stood
many
a
blast
in
the
persecution
of
the
latter
days
both
with
the
blackcuffs
and
the
bloody
dragoons
of
the
remorseless
graham
of
claver
he
was
bent
with
the
burden
of
time
and
leaning
on
his
staff
and
his
long
white
hair
hung
down
from
aneath
his
broad
blue
bonnet
he
was
one
whom
my
grandfather
held
in
great
respect
for
the
sincerity
of
his
principles
and
the
discretion
of
his
judgment
and
among
all
his
neighbours
and
nowhere
more
than
in
our
house
was
he
considered
a
most
patriarchal
character
come
awa
ebenezer
said
my
father
i
blithe
and
i
sorrowful
to
see
you
this
night
we
may
be
to
speak
in
peace
of
the
things
that
pertain
unto
salvation
but
the
day
and
the
hour
is
not
far
off
when
the
flock
of
christ
shall
be
scattered
and
driven
from
the
pastures
of
their
divine
master
to
these
words
of
affliction
ebenezer
muir
made
no
response
but
went
straight
to
the
fireside
facing
nanse
snoddie
and
sat
down
without
speaking
and
my
father
then
observing
john
fullarton
of
dykedivots
coming
in
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
hold
of
his
and
drew
him
to
sit
down
by
his
side
they
had
been
in
a
manner
brothers
from
their
youth
upward
an
uncle
of
john
fullarton
by
whom
he
was
brought
up
had
been
owner
and
he
himself
had
heired
and
was
then
possessor
of
the
mailing
of
dykedivot
beside
ours
he
was
the
father
of
four
brave
sons
the
youngest
of
whom
a
stripling
of
some
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
was
at
his
back
the
other
three
came
in
afterwards
he
was
moreover
a
man
of
a
stout
and
courageous
nature
though
of
a
temper

he
to
my
father
i

straemash
and
hobbleshow
that
fell
out
last
sabbath
in
embro
has
been
seen
wi
the
glamoured
een
o

and
that
the
king
and

themsels
as
to
meddle
wi
the
ordinances
of
the
lord
i
doot
i
doot
it
owre
true
john
replied
my
father
in
a
very
mournful
manner
and
while
they
were
thus
speaking
nahum
chapelrig
came
ben
he
was
a
young
man
and
his
father
being
precentor
and
schoolmaster
of
the
parish
he
had
more
lair
than
commonly
falls
to
the
lot
of
country
folk
over
and
aboon
this
he
was
of
a
spirity
disposition
and
both
eydent
and
eager
in
whatsoever
he
undertook
so
that
for
his
years
he
was
greatly
looked
up
to
amang
all
his
acquaintance
notwithstanding
a
small
spicin
of
conceit
that
he
was
in
with
himself
on
seeing
him
coming
in
worthy
ebenezer
muir
made
a
sign
for
him
to
draw
near
and
sit
by
him
and
when
he
went
forward
and
drew
in
a
stool
the
old
man
took
hold
of
him
by
the
hand
and
said
ye
weel
come
nahum
and
my
father
added
ay
nahum
chapelrig
it
fast
coming
to
pass
as
ye
hae
been
aye
saying
it
would
the
king
has
na
restit
putting
the
prelates
upon
us
what
te
prelates
robin
fullarton
said
auld
nanse
snoddie
turning
round
to
john
son
who
was
standing
behind
his
father
they
the
red
dragons
o
unrighteousness
replied
the
sincere
laddie
with
great
vehemence
gude
guide
us
cried
nanse
with
the
voice
of
terror
and
has
the
king
to
send
sic
accursed
things
to
devour
god
people
but
my
mother
who
was
sitting
behind
me
touched
her
on
the
shoulder
bidding
her
be
quiet
for
the
poor
woman
being
then
doited
when
left
to
the
freedom
of
her
own
will
was
apt
to
expatiate
without
ceasing
on
whatsoever
she
happened
to
discourse
anent
and
nahum
chapelrig
said
to
my
father
sawners
gilhaize
we
could
look
for
nae
better
prelacy
is
but
the
prelude
o
papistry
but
the
papistry
o
this
prelude
is
a
perilous
papistry
indeed
for
its
roots
of
rankness
are
in
the
of
arminianism
which
in
a
sense
is
a
greater
antichrist
than
antichrist
himself
even
where
he
sits
on
his
throne
of
thraldom
in
the
roman
vaticano
but
nevertheless
i
trust
and
hope
that
though
the
virgin
bride
of
protestantism
be
for
a
season
thrown
on
her
back
she
shall
not
be
overcome
but
will
so
strive
and
warsle
aneath
the
foul
grips
of
that
rampant
arminian
the
english
laud
that
he
shall
himself
be
cast
into
the
mire
or
choket
wi
the
stoure
of
his
own
bakiefu
of
abominations
wherewith
he
would
overwhelm
and
bury
the
evangil
yea
even
though
the
shield
of
his
mighty
men
is
made
red
and
his
valiant
men
are
in
scarlet
he
shall
recount
his
worthies
but
they
shall
stumble
in
their
walk
while
nahum
was
thus
holding
forth
the
house
filled
even
to
the
with
the
neighbours
old
and
young
and
several
from
time
to
time
spoke
bitterly
against
the
deadly
sin
and
aggression
which
the
king
was
committing
in
the
rape
that
the
reading
of
the
liturgy
was
upon
the
consciences
of
his
people
at
last
ebenezer
muir
taking
off
his
bonnet
and
rising
laid
it
down
on
his
seat
behind
him
and
then
resting
with
both
his
hands
on
his
staff
looked
up
and
every
one
was
hushed
truly
it
was
an
affecting
sight
to
behold
that
very
aged
and
venerable
man
so
standing
in
the
midst
of
all
his
dismayed
and
pious
neighbours
his
grey
hairs
flowing
from
his
haffets
and
the
light
of
our
lowly
hearth
shining
upon
his
bald
head
and
reverent
countenance
friens
said
he
i
hae
lived
lang
in
the
world
and
in
this
house
i
hae
often
partaken
the
sweet
repast
of
the
conversations
of
that
sanctified
character
michael
gilhaize
whom
we
a
revered
as
a
parent
not
more
for
his
ain
worth
than
for
the
great
things
to
which
he
was
a
witness
in
the
trials
and
troubles
of
the
reformation
and
it
seems
to
me
frae
a
the
experience
i
hae
gatherit
that
when
ance
kings
and
governments
hae
taken
a
step
let
it
be
sae
rash
there
a
something
in
the
nature
of
rule
and
power
that
winna
let
them
confess
a
though
they
may
afterwards
be
constrained
to
renounce
the
evil
of
their
ways
it
was
therefore
wi
a
sore
heart
that
i
heard
this
day
the
doleful
tidings
frae
embro
and
moreover
that
i
hae
listened
to
the
outbreathings
this
night
of
the
heaviness
wherewith
the
news
hae
oppressed
you
a
sure
am
i
that
frae
the
provocation
given
to
the
people
of
scotland
by
the
king
miscounselled
majesty
nothing
but
tears
and
woes
can
ensue
for
by
the
manner
in
which
they
hae
already
rebutted
the
aggression
he
will
in
return
be
stirred
to
aggrieve
them
still
farther
i
now
an
auld
man
and
may
be
removed
before
the
woes
come
to
pass
but
it
requires
not
the
of
prophecy
to
spae
bloodshed
and
suffering
and
many
afflictions
in
your
fortunes
nevertheless
friens
be
of
good
cheer
for
the
lord
will
prosper
his
own
cause
neither
king
nor
priest
nor
any
human
authority
has
the
right
to
interfere
between
you
and
your
god
and
allegiance
ends
where
persecution
begins
never
therefore
in
the
trials
awaiting
you
forget
that
the
right
to
resist
in
matters
of
conscience
is
the
of
religious
liberty
o
see
therefore
that
you
guard
it
weel
the
voice
and
manner
of
the
aged
speaker
melted
every
heart
many
of
the
women
sobbed
aloud
and
the
children
were
moved
as
i
was
myself
and
as
i
have
often
heard
them
in
their
manhood
tell
as
if
the
spirit
of
faith
and
fortitude
had
entered
into
the
very
bones
and
marrow
of
their
bodies
nor
ever
afterwards
have
i
heard
psalm
sung
with
such
melodious
energy
of
holiness
as
that
pious
congregation
of
simple
country
folk
sung
the
hundred
and
fortieth
psalm
before
departing
for
their
lowly
dwellings
on
that
solemn
evening
chapter
xxxix
it
was
on
the
wednesday
that
my
father
came
home
from
edinburgh
on
friday
the
farmer
lads
and
their
fathers
continued
coming
over
to
our
house
to
hear
the
news
and
all
their
discourse
was
concerning
the
manifest
foretaste
of
papistry
which
was
in
the
praying
of
the
prayers
that
an
obdurate
prince
and
an
alien
arminian
prelate
were
attempting
to
thrust
into
their
mouths
and
every
one
spoke
of
renewing
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
which
in
the
times
of
the
reformation
and
the
dangers
of
the
spanish
armada
had
achieved
such
great
things
for
the
truth
and
the
word
on
saturday
mr
sundrum
our
minister
called
for
my
father
about
twelve
he
had
heard
the
news
and
also
that
my
father
had
come
back
i
was
doing
something
on
the
green
i
forget
now
what
it
was
when
i
saw
him
coming
towards
the
door
and
i
ran
into
the
house
to
tell
my
father
who
immediately
came
out
to
meet
him
little
passed
in
my
hearing
between
them
for
after
a
short
inquiry
concerning
how
my
father
had
fared
in
the
journey
the
minister
took
hold
of
him
by
the
arm
and
they
walked
together
into
the
fields
where
when
they
were
at
some
distance
from
the
house
mr
sundrum
stopped
and
began
to
discourse
in
a
very
earnest
and
lively
manner
frequently
touching
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
with
the
fingers
of
his
right
as
he
spoke
to
my
father
and
sometimes
lifting
both
his
hands
as
one
in
amaze
ejaculating
to
the
heavens
while
they
were
thus
reasoning
together
worthy
ebenezer
muir
came
towards
the
house
but
observing
where
they
were
he
turned
off
and
joined
them
and
they
continued
all
three
in
vehement
deliberation
in
so
much
that
i
was
drawn
by
the
thirst
of
curiosity
to
slip
so
near
towards
them
that
i
could
hear
what
passed
and
my
young
heart
was
pierced
at
the
severe
terms
in
which
the
minister
was
condemning
the
ringleaders
of
the
riot
as
he
called
the
adversaries
of
popedom
in
edinburgh
and
in
a
manner
rebuking
my
honest
father
as
a
sower
of
sedition
my
father
however
said
stiffly
for
he
was
not
a
man
to
controvert
with
a
minister
that
in
all
temporal
things
he
was
a
true
and
leil
subject
and
in
what
pertained
to
the
king
as
king
he
would
stand
as
stoutly
up
for
as
any
man
in
the
three
kingdoms
but
against
a
usurpation
of
the
lord
rights
his
hand
his
heart
and
his
sword
that
had
been
used
in
the
reformation
were
all
alike
ready
old
ebenezer
muir
tried
to
pacify
him
and
reasoned
in
great
gentleness
with
both
expressing
his
concern
that
a
presbyterian
minister
could
think
that
the
attempt
to
bring
in
prelacy
and
the
reading
of
prayers
was
not
a
meddling
with
things
sacred
and
rights
natural
which
neither
prince
nor
potentate
had
authority
to
do
but
mr
sundrum
was
one
of
those
that
longed
for
the
of
egypt
and
the
fat
things
of
a
lordly
hierarchy
and
the
pacific
remonstrances
of
the
pious
old
man
made
him
wax
more
and
more
wroth
at
what
he
hatefully
pronounced
their
rebellious
inclinations
at
which
bitter
words
both
my
father
and
ebenezer
muir
turned
from
him
and
went
together
to
the
house
with
sadness
in
their
faces
leaving
him
to
return
the
way
he
had
come
alone
a
thing
which
filled
me
with
consternation
he
having
ever
before
been
treated
and
reverenced
as
a
pastor
ought
always
to
be
what
comment
my
father
and
the
old
man
made
on
his
conduct
when
they
were
by
themselves
i
know
not
but
on
the
sabbath
morning
the
kirk
was
filled
to
overflowing
and
my
father
took
me
with
him
by
the
hand
and
we
sat
together
on
the
same
form
with
ebenezer
muir
whom
we
found
in
the
church
before
us
when
mr
sundrum
mounted
into
the
pulpit
and
read
the
psalm
and
said
the
prayer
there
was
nothing
particular
but
when
he
prepared
to
preach
there
was
a
rustle
of
expectation
among
all
present
for
the
text
he
chose
was
from
romans
chapter
xiii
and
verses
and
from
which
he
made
an
endeavour
to
demonstrate
as
i
heard
afterwards
for
i
was
then
too
young
to
discern
the
matter
of
it
myself
the
duty
and
advantages
of
passive
obedience
and
growing
warm
with
his
ungospel
rhetoric
he
began
to
rail
and
to
daud
the
pulpit
in
condemnation
of
the
spirit
which
had
kithed
in
edinburgh
ebenezer
muir
and
my
father
tholed
with
him
for
some
time
but
at
last
he
so
far
forgot
his
place
and
office
that
they
both
rose
and
moved
towards
the
door
many
others
did
the
same
and
presently
the
whole
congregation
with
the
exception
of
a
very
few
also
began
to
move
so
that
the
kirk
skayled
and
from
that
day
so
long
as
mr
sundrum
continued
in
the
parish
he
was
as
a
leper
and
an
excommunicant
meanwhile
the
alarm
was
spreading
far
and
wide
and
a
blessed
thing
it
was
for
the
shire
of
ayr
though
it
caused
its
soil
to
be
soakened
with
the
blood
of
martyrs
that
few
of
the
ministers
were
like
the
mr
sundrum
but
trusty
and
valiant
defenders
of
the
green
pastures
whereon
they
had
delighted
like
kind
shepherds
to
lead
their
confiding
flocks
and
to
cherish
the
young
lambs
thereof
with
the
tender
embraces
of
a
holy
ministry
among
the
rest
that
godly
and
great
saint
mr
swinton
of
garnock
our
neighbour
parish
stood
courageously
forward
in
the
gap
of
the
broken
fence
of
the
vineyard
announcing
after
a
most
weighty
discourse
on
the
same
day
on
which
mr
sundrum
preached
the
erroneous
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
that
next
sabbath
he
would
administer
the
sacrament
of
the
lord
supper
not
knowing
how
long
it
might
be
in
the
power
of
his
people
to
partake
of
it
every
body
around
accordingly
prepared
to
be
present
on
that
occasion
and
there
was
a
wonderful
congregation
all
the
adjacent
parishes
in
succession
did
the
same
thing
sabbath
after
sabbath
and
never
was
there
seen
in
the
memory
of
living
man
such
a
zealous
devotion
and
strictness
of
life
as
then
reigned
throughout
the
whole
west
country
at
last
the
news
came
that
it
was
resolved
among
the
great
and
faithful
at
edinburgh
to
renew
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
and
the
ministers
of
our
neighbourhood
having
conferred
together
concerning
the
same
it
was
agreed
among
them
that
the
people
should
be
invited
to
come
forward
on
a
day
set
apart
for
the
purpose
and
that
as
the
kirk
of
irvine
was
the
biggest
in
the
vicinage
the
signatures
both
for
the
country
and
that
town
should
be
received
there
mr
dickson
the
minister
than
whom
no
man
of
his
day
was
more
brave
in
the
lord
cause
accordingly
made
the
needful
preparation
and
appointed
the
time
in
the
meanwhile
the
young
men
began
to
gird
themselves
for
war
the
swords
that
had
rested
for
many
a
day
were
drawn
from
their
idle
places
and
the
women
worked
together
that
their
brothers
and
their
sons
might
be
ready
for
the
field
but
at
their
work
instead
of
the
ancient
lilts
they
sung
psalms
and
godly
ballads
however
as
i
mean
not
to
enter
upon
the
particulars
of
that
awakening
epoch
but
only
to
show
forth
the
pure
and
the
holy
earnestness
with
which
the
minds
of
men
were
then
actuated
i
shall
here
refer
the
courteous
reader
to
the
annals
and
chronicles
of
the
time
albeit
the
truth
in
them
has
suffered
from
the
alloy
of
a
base
servility
chapter
xl
the
sixteenth
day
of
june
in
the
year
of
our
lord
was
appointed
for
the
renewal
at
irvine
of
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
on
the
night
before
my
five
elder
brothers
who
were
learning
trades
at
glasgow
and
kilmarnock
came
home
that
they
might
go
up
with
their
father
to
the
house
of
god
in
order
to
set
down
their
names
together
me
and
my
four
sisters
the
rest
of
his
ten
children
were
still
biding
with
our
mother
and
him
at
the
mailing
from
my
grandfather
time
there
had
been
a
respect
among
the
neighbours
for
our
family
on
his
account
and
that
morning
my
brother
jacob
who
happened
to
be
the
first
that
went
at
break
of
day
to
the
door
was
surprised
to
see
many
of
the
cotters
and
neighbouring
farmer
lads
already
assembled
on
the
lone
waiting
to
walk
with
us
to
the
town
as
a
token
of
their
reverence
for
the
principles
and
the
memory
of
that
departed
worthy
and
they
were
all
belted
and
armed
with
swords
like
men
ready
for
battle
seeing
such
a
concourse
of
the
neighbours
instead
of
making
exercise
in
the
house
my
father
as
the
morning
was
bright
and
lown
bade
me
carry
the
bible
and
a
stool
to
the
dykeside
that
our
friends
might
have
room
to
join
us
in
worship
which
i
did
accordingly
placing
the
stool
under
the
at
the
corner
of
the
and
by
all
those
who
were
present
on
that
occasion
the
spot
was
ever
afterwards
regarded
as
a
hallowed
place
truly
there
was
a
scene
and
a
sight
there
not
likely
to
be
soon
forgotten
for
the
awful
cause
that
had
brought
together
that
meeting
was
a
thing
which
no
man
who
had
a
part
therein
could
ever
in
all
his
days
forget
my
father
chose
the
psalm
and
when
it
was
sung
he
opened
the
scriptures
in
second
kings
and
read
aloud
with
a
strong
voice
the
chapter
and
every
one
likened
josiah
to
the
old
king
and
jehoahaz
to
his
son
charles
by
whose
disregard
of
the
covenant
the
spirit
of
the
land
was
then
in
such
tribulation
and
at
the
conclusion
instead
of
kneeling
to
pray
as
he
was
wont
my
father
stood
up
and
as
if
all
temporal
things
were
then
of
no
account
he
only
supplicated
that
the
work
they
had
in
hand
for
that
day
might
be
approved
and
sanctified
the
worship
being
over
the
family
returned
into
the
house
and
having
partaken
of
a
repast
of
bread
and
milk
my
father
put
on
his
sword
and
my
brothers
who
had
brought
weapons
of
their
own
home
with
them
also
belted
themselves
for
the
road
i
was
owre
young
to
be
yet
trysted
for
war
so
my
father
led
me
out
by
the
hand
and
walking
forward
followed
by
my
brothers
the
neighbours
two
and
two
fell
into
the
rear
and
the
women
in
their
plaids
came
mournful
and
in
tears
at
some
short
distance
behind
as
we
were
thus
proceeding
towards
the
main
road
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
drum
and
fife
and
saw
over
the
hedge
of
the
lane
that
leads
to
the
clachan
a
white
banner
waving
aloft
with
the
words
solemn
league
and
covenant
painted
thereon
at
the
sight
of
which
my
father
was
much
disturbed
saying
this
is
some
silly
device
of
nahum
chapelrig
that
if
we
allow
to
proceed
may
bring
scoff
and
scorn
upon
the
cause
as
we
enter
the
town
and
with
that
dropping
my
hand
he
ran
forward
and
stopped
their
vain
bravery
for
it
was
as
he
had
supposed
the
work
of
nahum
who
was
marching
like
a
man
of
war
at
the
head
of
his
band
however
on
my
father
remonstrance
he
consented
to
send
away
his
sounding
instruments
and
idle
banner
and
to
walk
composedly
along
with
us
as
we
reached
the
port
we
fell
in
with
a
vast
number
of
other
persons
from
different
parts
of
the
country
going
to
sign
the
covenant
and
on
a
cart
worthy
ebenezer
muir
and
three
other
aged
men
like
himself
who
being
all
of
our
parish
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
alight
and
walk
to
the
kirk
at
the
head
of
those
who
had
come
with
my
father
while
this
was
putting
in
order
other
men
and
lads
belonging
to
the
parish
came
and
joined
us
so
that
to
the
number
of
more
than
a
hundred
we
went
up
the
town
together
when
we
arrived
at
the
tolbooth
we
were
obligated
with
others
to
halt
for
some
time
by
reason
of
the
great
crowd
at
the
kirkgatefoot
waiting
to
see
if
the
magistrates
who
were
then
sitting
in
council
would
come
forth
and
go
to
the
kirk
and
the
different
crafts
and
burgesses
with
their
deacons
were
standing
at
the
cross
in
order
to
follow
them
if
they
determined
in
their
public
capacity
to
sign
the
covenant
according
to
the
pious
example
which
had
been
set
to
all
in
authority
by
the
magistrates
and
of
edinburgh
three
days
before
we
had
not
however
occasion
to
be
long
detained
for
it
was
resolved
with
a
unanimous
heart
that
the
provost
should
sign
in
the
name
of
the
town
and
that
the
bailies
and
councillors
should
in
their
own
names
sign
each
for
himself
so
they
came
out
with
the
bearing
their
before
them
and
the
crafts
according
to
their
privilege
followed
them
to
the
kirk
the
men
of
our
parish
went
next
but
on
reaching
the
yett
it
was
manifest
that
large
as
the
ancient
fabric
was
it
would
not
be
able
to
receive
a
moité
of
the
persons
assembled
godly
mr
david
dickson
the
minister
had
however
provided
for
this
and
on
one
of
the
old
tombs
on
the
south
side
of
the
kirk
he
had
ordered
a
table
and
chair
to
be
placed
where
that
effectual
preacher
mr
livingstone
delivered
a
great
sermon
around
him
the
multitude
from
the
country
parishes
were
congregated
but
my
father
being
well
acquainted
with
deacon
auld
of
the
wrights
was
invited
by
him
to
come
into
his
seat
in
the
kirk
where
he
carried
me
in
with
him
and
we
heard
mr
dickson
himself
of
the
strain
and
substance
of
his
discourse
i
remember
nothing
save
only
the
earnestness
of
his
manner
but
well
do
i
remember
the
awful
sough
and
silence
that
was
in
the
kirk
when
at
the
conclusion
of
the
sermon
he
prepared
to
read
the
words
of
the
covenant
now
said
he
when
he
had
come
to
the
end
and
was
rolling
it
up
as
no
man
knoweth
how
long
after
this
day
he
may
be
allowed
to
partake
of
the
sacrament
of
the
supper
the
elders
will
bring
forward
the
elements
and
it
is
hoped
that
sisters
in
christ
will
not
come
to
communion
till
the
brethren
are
served
who
as
they
take
their
seats
at
the
table
are
invited
to
sign
their
names
to
this
solemn
charter
of
the
religious
rights
and
liberties
of
god
people
in
scotland
he
then
came
down
from
the
pulpit
with
the
parchment
in
his
hand
and
going
to
the
head
of
the
sacramental
table
he
opened
it
again
and
laid
it
down
over
the
elements
of
the
bread
and
wine
which
the
elders
had
just
placed
there
and
a
minister
whose
name
i
do
not
well
recollect
sitting
at
his
right
hand
holding
an
inkstand
presented
him
with
a
pen
which
when
he
had
taken
he
prayed
in
silence
for
the
space
of
a
minute
and
then
bending
forward
he
signed
his
name
having
done
so
he
raised
himself
erect
and
said
with
a
loud
voice
holding
up
his
right
hand
before
god
and
these
witnesses
in
truth
and
holiness
i
have
sworn
to
keep
this
covenant
at
that
moment
a
solemn
sound
rose
from
all
the
congregation
and
every
one
stood
up
to
see
the
men
as
they
sat
at
the
table
put
down
their
names
chapter
xli
from
the
day
on
which
the
covenant
was
signed
though
i
was
owre
young
to
remember
the
change
myself
i
have
heard
it
often
said
that
a
great
alteration
took
place
in
the
morals
and
manners
of
the
covenanters
the
sabbath
was
observed
by
them
with
far
more
than
the
solemnity
of
times
past
and
there
was
a
strictness
of
walk
and
conversation
among
them
which
showed
how
much
in
sincerity
they
were
indeed
regenerated
christians
the
company
of
persons
inclined
to
the
prelatic
sect
was
eschewed
as
contagious
and
all
light
pastimes
and
gayety
of
heart
were
suppressed
both
on
account
of
their
tendency
to
sinfulness
and
because
of
the
danger
with
which
the
truth
and
the
word
were
threatened
by
the
arminian
antichrist
of
the
king
government
but
the
more
immediate
effect
of
the
renewal
of
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
was
the
preparation
for
defence
and
resistance
which
the
deceitful
policy
of
that
false
monarch
king
charles
the
first
taught
every
one
to
know
would
be
required
the
men
began
to
practise
firing
at
butts
and
targets
and
to
provide
themselves
with
arms
and
munitions
of
war
while
in
order
to
maintain
a
life
void
of
offence
in
all
temporal
concerns
they
were
by
ordinare
obedient
and
submissive
to
those
in
authority
over
them
whether
holding
jurisdiction
from
the
king
or
in
virtue
of
baronies
and
feudalities
in
this
there
was
great
wisdom
for
it
left
the
sin
of
the
provocation
still
on
the
heads
of
the
king
and
his
evil
counsellors
in
so
much
that
even
when
the
general
assembly
holden
at
glasgow
vindicated
the
independence
and
freedom
of
christ
kingdom
by
continuing
to
sit
in
despite
of
the
dissolution
pronounced
by
king
charles
commissioner
the
marquis
hamilton
and
likewise
by
decreeing
the
abolition
of
prelacy
as
an
abomination
there
was
no
political
blame
wherewith
the
people
in
their
capacity
of
subjects
to
their
earthly
prince
could
be
wyted
or
brought
by
law
to
punishment
in
the
meantime
the
king
who
was
as
fey
as
he
was
false
mustered
his
forces
and
his
rampant
laud
was
with
all
the
voices
of
his
prelatic
emissaries
inflaming
the
honest
people
of
england
to
wage
war
against
our
religious
freedom
the
papistical
queen
of
charles
was
no
less
busy
with
the
priesthood
of
her
crafty
sect
and
aids
and
powers
both
of
men
and
money
were
raised
wherever
they
could
be
had
in
order
to
reinstall
the
discarded
episcopacy
of
scotland
the
covenanters
however
were
none
daunted
for
they
had
a
great
ally
in
the
lord
of
hosts
and
with
him
for
their
captain
they
neither
sought
nor
wished
for
any
alien
assistance
though
they
sent
letters
to
their
brethren
in
foreign
parts
exhorting
them
to
unite
in
the
covenant
and
to
join
them
for
the
battle
general
lesley
in
gustavus
adolphus
army
was
invited
by
his
kinsman
the
lord
rothes
to
come
home
that
if
need
arose
he
might
take
the
temporal
command
of
the
covenanters
the
king
having
at
last
according
to
an
ancient
practice
of
the
english
monarchs
when
war
in
old
times
was
proclaimed
against
the
scots
summoned
his
nobles
to
attend
him
with
their
powers
at
york
the
covenanters
girded
their
loins
and
the
whole
country
rung
with
the
din
of
the
gathering
of
an
host
for
the
field
one
captain
bannerman
who
had
been
with
lesley
in
the
armies
of
gustavus
was
sent
from
edinburgh
to
train
the
men
in
our
part
and
our
house
being
central
for
the
musters
of
the
three
adjacent
parishes
he
staid
a
night
in
the
week
with
us
at
quharist
for
the
space
of
better
than
two
months
and
his
military
discourse
greatly
instructed
our
neighbours
in
the
arts
and
stratagems
of
war
he
was
an
elderly
man
of
a
sedate
character
and
had
gone
abroad
with
an
uncle
from
montrose
when
he
was
quite
a
youth
in
his
day
he
had
seen
many
strange
cities
and
places
of
wonderful
strength
to
withstand
the
force
of
sieges
but
though
bred
a
soldier
and
his
home
in
the
camp
he
had
been
himself
but
seldom
in
the
field
of
battle
in
appearance
he
was
tall
and
lofty
and
very
erect
and
formal
a
man
of
few
words
but
they
were
well
chosen
and
he
was
patient
and
of
a
contented
aspect
somewhat
and
seldom
given
to
smile
to
little
children
he
was
however
bland
and
courteous
taking
a
pleasure
in
setting
those
that
were
of
my
age
in
battle
array
for
he
had
no
pastime
being
altogether
an
instructive
soldier
or
as
william
my
third
brother
used
to
say
who
was
a
free
lad
captain
bannerman
was
a
real
dominie
o
war
besides
him
in
our
there
was
another
officer
by
name
hepburn
who
had
also
been
bred
with
the
great
gustavus
sent
to
train
the
covenanters
in
irvine
but
he
was
of
a
more
mettlesome
humour
and
lacked
the
needful
douceness
that
became
those
who
were
banding
themselves
for
a
holy
cause
so
that
when
any
of
his
disciples
were
not
just
so
list
and
brisk
as
they
might
have
been
which
was
sometimes
the
case
especially
among
the
weavers
he
thought
no
shame
even
on
the
before
all
the
folks
and
onlookers
to
curse
and
swear
at
them
as
if
he
had
been
himself
one
of
the
king
cavaliers
and
they
no
better
than
receiving
the
wages
of
sin
against
the
covenant
in
sooth
to
say
he
was
a
young
man
of
a
disorderly
nature
and
about
seven
months
after
he
left
the
town
twa
misfortunate
creatures
gave
him
the
wyte
of
their
bairns
yet
for
all
the
regardlessness
of
his
ways
and
moral
conduct
he
was
much
beloved
by
the
men
he
had
the
training
of
and
on
the
night
before
he
left
the
town
lies
were
told
of
a
most
respectit
and
pious
officer
of
the
town
power
if
he
did
not
find
the
causey
owre
wide
when
he
was
going
home
after
partaking
of
captain
hepburn
supper
but
how
that
may
have
been
is
little
of
my
business
at
present
to
investigate
for
i
have
only
spoken
of
hepburn
to
notify
what
happened
in
consequence
of
a
brag
he
had
with
bannerman
anent
the
skill
of
their
respective
disciples
the
which
grew
to
such
a
controversy
between
them
that
nothing
less
would
satisfy
hepburn
than
to
try
the
skill
of
the
irvine
men
against
ours
and
the
two
neighbouring
parishes
of
garnock
and
stoneyholm
accordingly
a
day
was
fixt
for
that
purpose
and
the
was
the
place
appointed
for
this
probation
of
soldiership
on
the
morning
of
the
appointed
day
the
country
folk
assembled
far
and
near
and
nahum
chapelrig
at
the
head
of
the
lads
of
his
clachan
was
the
first
on
the
field
the
sight
to
my
young
eyes
was
as
the
greatest
show
of
pageantry
that
could
be
imagined
for
nahum
had
from
the
time
of
the
covenanting
been
gathering
arms
and
armour
from
all
quarters
and
had
thereby
not
only
obtained
a
glittering
breastplate
for
himself
but
three
other
coats
of
mail
for
the
like
number
of
his
fellows
and
when
they
were
coming
over
the
croft
with
their
fife
and
drum
and
the
banner
of
the
covenant
waving
aloft
in
the
air
every
one
ran
to
behold
such
splendour
and
pomp
of
war
many
of
the
women
that
were
witnesses
among
the
multitude
wept
at
such
an
apparition
of
battles
dazzling
our
peaceful
fields
my
father
with
my
five
brothers
headed
the
covenanters
of
our
parish
there
was
no
garnish
among
that
band
they
came
along
with
austere
looks
and
douce
steps
and
their
belts
were
of
tanned
leather
the
hilts
of
many
of
their
swords
were
rusty
for
they
had
been
the
weapons
of
their
forefathers
in
the
raids
of
the
reformation
as
my
father
led
them
to
their
station
on
the
right
flank
of
nahum
chapelrig
array
the
crowd
of
onlookers
fell
back
and
stood
in
silence
as
they
passed
by
scarcely
had
they
halted
when
there
was
a
rushing
among
the
onlookers
and
presently
the
townsmen
with
hepburn
on
horseback
were
seen
coming
over
the
brow
of
the
they
were
scant
the
strength
of
the
country
folk
by
more
than
a
score
but
there
was
a
band
of
sailor
boys
with
them
that
made
the
number
greater
so
that
when
they
were
all
drawn
up
together
forenent
the
countrymen
they
were
more
than
man
for
man
it
is
not
to
be
suppressed
nor
denied
that
in
the
first
show
of
the
day
hepburn
got
far
more
credit
and
honour
than
old
sedate
bannerman
for
his
lads
were
lighter
in
the
heel
glegger
in
the
eye
and
brisker
in
the
manoeuvres
of
war
moreover
they
were
all
far
more
similar
in
their
garb
and
appearance
which
gave
them
a
seeming
compactness
that
the
countrymen
had
nothing
like
but
when
the
sham
contest
began
it
was
not
long
till
bannerman
disciples
showed
the
proofs
of
their
better
skill
to
such
a
mark
that
hepburn
grew
hot
and
so
kindled
his
men
by
reproaches
that
there
was
like
to
have
been
fighting
in
true
earnest
for
the
blood
of
the
country
folk
was
also
rising
their
eyes
grew
fierce
and
they
muttered
through
their
teeth
old
ebenezer
muir
who
was
among
the
multitude
observing
that
their
blood
was
heating
stepped
forward
and
lifting
up
his
hand
cried
sirs
stop
and
both
sides
instanter
made
a
pause
this
maunna
be
said
he
it
may
be
sport
to
those
who
are
by
trade
soldiers
to
try
the
mettle
o
their
men
but
ye
a
covenanted
people
obligated
by
a
grievous
tyranny
to
quit
your
spades
and
your
looms
only
for
a
season
therefore
be
counselled
and
rush
not
to
battle
till
need
be
which
may
the
lord
yet
prevent
hepburn
uttered
an
angry
ban
and
would
have
turned
the
old
man
away
by
the
shoulder
but
the
combatants
saw
they
were
in
the
peril
of
a
quarrel
and
many
of
them
cried
aloud
he
in
the
right
and
playing
the
fool
for
the
diversion
o
our
adversaries
so
the
townsmen
and
the
country
folk
shook
hands
but
instead
of
renewing
the
contest
captain
bannerman
proposed
that
they
should
all
go
through
their
discipline
together
it
being
manifest
that
there
were
little
odds
in
their
skill
and
none
in
their
courage
the
which
prudent
admonition
pacified
all
parties
and
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
spent
in
cordiality
and
brotherly
love
towards
the
conclusion
of
the
exercises
worthy
mr
swinton
came
on
the
field
and
when
the
business
of
the
day
was
over
he
stepped
forward
and
the
trained
men
being
formed
around
him
the
onlookers
standing
on
the
outside
he
exhorted
them
in
prayer
and
implored
a
blessing
on
their
covenanted
union
which
had
the
effect
of
restoring
all
their
hearts
to
a
religious
frame
and
a
solemnity
befitting
the
spirituality
of
their
cause
chapter
xlii
one
night
about
a
month
after
the
ploy
whereof
i
have
spoken
in
the
foregoing
chapter
just
as
my
father
had
finished
the
worship
and
the
family
were
composing
themselves
round
the
fireside
for
supper
we
were
startled
by
the
sound
of
a
galloping
horse
coming
to
the
door
and
before
any
one
had
time
to
open
it
there
was
a
dreadful
knocking
with
the
heft
of
the
rider
whip
it
was
nahum
chapelrig
who
being
that
day
at
kilmarnock
had
heard
as
he
was
leaving
the
town
the
cry
get
up
there
that
the
aggressor
was
coming
from
york
with
all
the
english
power
and
he
had
flown
far
and
wide
on
his
way
home
publishing
the
dismal
tidings
my
father
in
a
sober
manner
bade
him
alight
and
partake
of
our
supper
questioning
him
sedately
anent
what
he
had
heard
but
nahum
was
raised
and
could
give
no
satisfaction
in
his
answers
he
however
leapt
from
his
horse
and
drawing
the
bridle
through
the
ring
at
the
came
ben
to
the
fire
where
we
had
all
so
shortly
before
been
harmoniously
sitting
his
eyes
were
wide
and
wild
his
hair
with
the
heat
he
was
in
was
as
if
it
had
been
pomated
his
cheeks
were
white
his
lips
red
and
he
panted
with
haste
and
panic
they
coming
he
cried
in
thousands
o
thousands
never
sic
a
force
has
crossed
the
border
since
the
day
o
flodden
field
we
either
be
put
to
the
sword
man
woman
and
child
or
sent
in
slavery
to
the
plantations
no
replied
my
father
things
are
no
just
come
to
that
pass
we
have
our
swords
yet
and
hearts
and
hands
to
use
them
the
consternation
however
of
nahum
chapelrig
that
night
was
far
ayont
all
counsel
so
after
trying
to
soothe
and
reason
him
into
a
more
temperate
frame
my
father
was
obligated
to
tell
him
that
since
the
battle
was
coming
so
near
our
gates
it
behoved
the
covenanters
to
be
in
readiness
for
the
field
advising
nahum
to
go
home
and
be
over
with
him
betimes
in
the
morning
while
they
were
thus
speaking
james
newbigging
also
came
to
the
door
with
a
rumour
of
the
same
substance
which
his
wife
had
brought
from
eglinton
castle
where
she
had
been
with
certain
cocks
and
hens
a
servitude
of
the
eglintons
on
their
mailing
so
that
there
was
no
longer
any
dubiety
about
the
news
though
matters
were
not
in
such
a
desperate
condition
as
nahum
chapelrig
had
terrified
himself
with
the
thought
of
nevertheless
the
tidings
were
very
dreadful
and
it
was
a
thing
to
hear
that
an
anointed
king
was
so
far
left
to
himself
as
to
be
coming
with
wrath
and
banners
and
trampling
to
destroy
his
subjects
for
the
sincerity
of
their
religious
allegiance
to
that
almighty
monarch
who
has
but
permitted
the
princes
of
the
earth
to
be
set
up
as
idols
by
the
hands
of
men
james
newbigging
as
well
as
nahum
having
come
ben
to
the
fireside
my
father
called
for
the
books
again
and
gave
out
the
eight
first
verses
of
the
psalm
which
we
all
sung
with
hearts
in
holy
unison
and
zealous
voices
when
james
newbigging
and
nahum
chapelrig
were
gone
away
home
my
father
sat
for
some
time
exhorting
us
who
were
his
youngest
children
to
be
kind
to
one
another
to
cherish
our
mother
and
no
to
let
auld
doited
aunty
want
if
it
was
the
lord
will
that
he
should
never
come
back
from
the
battle
the
which
to
hear
caused
much
sorrow
and
lamentation
especially
from
my
mother
who
however
said
nothing
but
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
watered
it
with
her
tears
after
this
he
walked
out
into
the
fields
where
he
remained
some
time
alone
and
during
his
absence
me
and
the
three
who
were
next
to
me
were
sent
to
our
beds
but
young
as
we
then
were
we
were
old
enough
to
know
the
danger
that
hung
over
us
and
we
lay
long
awake
wondering
and
woful
with
fear
about
two
hours
after
midnight
the
house
was
again
startled
by
another
knocking
and
on
my
father
inquiring
who
was
at
the
door
he
was
answered
by
my
brother
jacob
who
had
come
with
michael
and
robin
from
glasgow
to
kilmarnock
on
hearing
the
news
and
had
thence
brought
william
and
alexander
with
them
to
go
with
their
father
to
the
war
for
they
had
returned
to
their
respective
trades
after
the
day
of
the
covenanting
and
had
only
been
out
at
hepburn
raid
as
the
ploy
with
the
irvine
men
was
called
in
jocularity
in
order
that
the
neighbours
who
venerated
their
grandfather
might
see
them
together
as
covenanters
the
arrival
of
her
sons
and
the
purpose
they
had
come
upon
awakened
afresh
the
grief
of
our
mother
but
my
father
entreated
us
all
to
be
quiet
and
to
compose
ourselves
to
rest
that
we
might
be
the
abler
on
the
morn
to
prepare
for
what
might
then
ensue
yet
though
there
was
no
sound
in
the
house
save
only
our
mother
moaning
few
closed
their
eyes
and
long
before
the
sun
every
one
was
up
and
stirring
and
my
father
and
my
five
brothers
were
armed
and
belted
for
the
march
scarcely
were
they
ready
when
different
neighbours
in
the
like
trim
came
to
go
with
them
presently
also
nahum
chapelrig
with
his
banner
and
fife
and
drum
at
the
head
of
some
ten
or
twelve
lads
of
his
clachan
came
over
and
on
this
occasion
no
obstacle
was
made
to
that
bravery
which
was
thought
so
uncomely
on
the
day
of
the
covenanting
while
the
armed
men
were
thus
gathering
before
our
door
with
the
intent
of
setting
forward
to
glasgow
as
the
men
of
the
west
had
been
some
time
before
trysted
to
do
by
orders
from
general
lesley
on
the
first
alarm
that
godly
man
and
minister
of
righteousness
the
reverend
mr
swinton
made
his
appearance
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
and
a
satchel
on
his
back
in
which
he
carried
the
bible
i
am
come
my
friens
said
he
to
go
with
you
where
the
ensigns
of
christ
covenant
are
displayed
it
is
meet
that
the
very
lowest
of
his
vassals
should
be
there
and
having
exhorted
the
weeping
women
around
to
be
of
good
cheer
he
prayed
for
them
and
for
their
little
children
whom
the
aggressor
was
perhaps
soon
to
make
fatherless
nahum
chapelrig
then
exalted
his
banner
and
the
drum
and
fife
beginning
to
play
the
venerable
man
stepped
forward
and
heading
the
array
with
his
staff
in
his
hand
they
departed
amidst
the
shouts
of
the
boys
and
the
loud
sorrow
of
many
a
wife
and
mother
i
followed
them
with
my
companions
till
they
reached
the
high
road
where
at
the
turn
that
led
them
to
glasgow
a
great
concourse
of
other
women
and
children
belonging
to
the
neighbouring
parishes
were
assembled
having
there
parted
from
their
friends
they
were
all
mourning
and
weeping
and
mingling
their
lamentations
with
bitter
predictions
against
the
king
and
his
evil
counsellors
but
seeing
mr
swinton
they
became
more
composed
and
he
having
made
a
sign
to
the
drum
and
fife
to
cease
he
stopped
and
earnestly
entreated
them
to
return
home
and
employ
themselves
in
the
concerns
of
their
families
which
the
heads
being
for
a
season
removed
stood
the
more
in
need
of
all
their
kindness
and
care
this
halt
in
the
march
of
their
friends
brought
the
onlookers
who
were
assembled
round
our
house
running
to
see
what
was
the
cause
and
among
others
it
gave
time
to
the
aged
ebenezer
muir
to
come
up
whom
mr
swinton
no
sooner
saw
than
he
called
on
him
by
name
and
bade
him
comfort
the
women
and
invite
them
away
from
the
high
road
where
their
presence
could
only
increase
the
natural
grief
that
every
covenanted
christian
in
passing
to
join
the
army
could
not
but
suffer
on
seeing
so
many
left
defenceless
by
the
unprovoked
anger
of
the
aggressor
he
then
bade
the
drum
again
beat
and
the
march
being
resumed
the
band
of
our
parish
soon
went
out
of
sight
while
our
men
continued
in
view
ebenezer
muir
said
nothing
but
as
soon
as
they
had
disappeared
behind
the
brow
of
the
he
spoke
to
the
multitude
in
a
gentle
and
paternal
manner
and
bade
them
come
with
him
into
the
neighbouring
field
and
join
him
in
prayer
after
which
he
hoped
they
would
see
the
wisdom
of
returning
to
their
homes
they
accordingly
followed
him
and
he
having
given
out
the
psalm
all
present
joined
him
till
the
lonely
fields
and
silent
woods
echoed
to
the
melody
of
their
pious
song
as
we
were
thus
standing
around
the
old
man
in
worship
and
unison
of
spirit
the
irvine
men
came
along
the
road
and
seeing
us
they
hushed
their
drums
as
they
passed
by
and
bowed
down
their
banners
in
reverence
and
solemnity
such
was
the
outset
of
the
worthies
of
the
renewed
covenant
in
their
war
with
the
first
charles
chapter
xliii
after
my
father
and
brothers
with
our
neighbours
that
went
with
them
had
returned
from
the
bloodless
raid
of
dunse
law
as
the
first
expedition
was
called
a
solemn
thanksgiving
was
held
in
all
the
but
the
minds
of
men
were
none
pacified
by
the
treaty
concluded
with
the
king
at
berwick
for
it
was
manifest
to
the
world
that
coming
in
his
ire
and
with
all
the
might
of
his
power
to
punish
the
covenanters
as
rebels
he
would
never
have
consented
to
treat
with
them
on
anything
like
equal
terms
had
he
not
been
daunted
by
their
strength
and
numbers
so
that
the
spirit
awakened
by
his
domination
continued
as
alive
and
as
distrustful
of
his
word
and
pactions
as
ever
after
the
rumours
of
his
plain
juggling
about
the
verbals
of
the
stipulated
conditions
and
his
arbitrary
prorogation
of
the
parliament
at
edinburgh
a
thing
which
the
best
and
bravest
of
the
scottish
monarchs
had
never
before
dared
to
do
without
the
consent
of
the
states
then
assembled
the
thud
and
murmur
of
warlike
preparation
was
renewed
both
on
anvil
and
in
hall
and
when
it
was
known
that
the
king
fey
and
distempered
with
his
own
weak
conceits
and
the
instigations
of
cruel
counsellors
had
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
the
covenanters
were
disbanded
renewed
his
purposes
of
punishment
and
oppression
a
gurl
of
rage
like
the
first
brush
of
the
tempest
on
the
waves
passed
over
the
whole
extent
of
scotland
and
those
that
had
been
in
arms
fiercely
girded
themselves
again
for
battle
as
the
king
powers
came
again
towards
the
borders
the
covenanters
for
the
second
time
mustered
under
lesley
at
dunse
but
far
different
was
this
new
departure
of
our
men
from
the
solemnity
of
their
first
expedition
their
spirits
were
now
harsh
and
angry
and
their
drums
sounded
hoarsely
on
the
breeze
godly
mr
swinton
as
he
headed
them
again
struck
the
ground
with
his
staff
and
instead
of
praying
said
it
is
the
lord
pleasure
and
he
will
make
the
aggressor
fin
the
weight
of
the
arm
of
flesh
honest
folk
are
no
ever
to
be
thus
obligated
to
leave
their
fields
and
families
by
the
provocations
of
a
prerogative
that
has
so
little
regard
for
the
people
in
the
name
and
strength
of
god
let
us
march
with
thousand
horse
and
foot
lesley
crossed
the
tweed
and
in
the
first
onset
the
king
army
was
scattered
like
chaff
before
the
wind
when
the
news
of
the
victory
arrived
among
us
every
one
was
filled
with
awe
and
holy
wonder
for
it
happened
on
the
very
day
which
was
held
as
a
universal
fast
throughout
the
land
on
that
day
likewise
even
in
the
time
of
worship
the
castle
of
dumbarton
was
won
and
the
covenanted
earl
of
haddington
repelled
a
wasteful
irruption
from
the
garrison
of
berwick
such
disasters
smote
the
king
with
consternation
for
the
immediate
fruit
of
the
victory
was
the
conquest
of
newcastle
tynemouth
shields
and
durham
baffled
and
mortified
humbled
but
not
penitent
the
rash
and
vindictive
monarch
in
a
whirlwind
of
mutiny
and
desertion
was
obligated
to
retreat
to
york
where
he
was
constrained
by
the
few
sound
and
that
yet
hovered
around
him
to
try
the
effect
of
another
negotiation
with
his
insulted
and
indignant
subjects
but
as
all
the
things
which
thence
ensued
are
mingled
with
the
acts
of
perfidy
and
aggression
by
which
under
the
disastrous
influence
of
the
fortunes
of
his
doomed
and
guilty
race
he
drew
down
the
vengeance
of
his
english
subjects
it
would
lead
me
far
from
this
household
memorial
to
enter
more
at
large
on
circumstances
so
notour
though
they
have
been
strangely
palliated
by
the
supple
spirit
of
latter
times
especially
by
the
sordid
courtliness
of
the
crafty
clarendon
i
shall
therefore
skip
the
main
passages
of
public
affairs
and
hasten
forward
to
the
time
when
i
became
myself
enlisted
on
the
side
of
our
national
liberties
briefly
however
noticing
as
i
proceed
that
after
the
peace
which
was
concluded
at
ripon
my
father
and
my
five
brothers
came
home
none
of
them
received
any
hurt
in
battle
but
in
the
course
of
the
winter
the
old
man
was
visited
with
a
great
income
of
pains
and
aches
in
so
much
that
for
the
remainder
of
his
days
he
was
little
able
to
endure
fatigue
or
hardship
of
any
kind
my
second
brother
robin
was
therefore
called
from
his
trade
in
glasgow
to
look
after
the
mailing
for
i
was
still
owre
young
to
be
of
any
effectual
service
alexander
continued
a
at
kilmarnock
but
michael
william
and
jacob
joined
and
fought
with
the
forces
that
won
the
mournful
triumph
of
marston
moor
where
fifty
thousand
subjects
of
the
same
king
and
laws
contended
with
one
another
and
where
the
lord
by
showing
himself
on
the
side
of
the
people
gave
a
dreadful
admonition
to
the
government
to
recant
and
conciliate
while
there
was
yet
time
meanwhile
the
worthy
mr
swinton
having
observed
in
me
a
curiosity
towards
books
of
history
and
piety
had
taken
great
pains
to
instruct
me
in
the
rights
and
truths
of
religion
and
to
make
it
manifest
alike
to
the
ears
and
eyes
of
my
understanding
that
no
human
authority
could
or
ought
to
dictate
in
matters
of
faith
because
it
could
not
discern
the
secrets
of
the
breast
neither
know
what
was
acceptable
to
heaven
in
conduct
or
in
worship
he
likewise
expounded
to
me
in
what
manner
the
covenant
was
not
a
temporal
but
a
spiritual
league
trenching
in
no
respect
upon
the
natural
and
contributed
authority
of
the
kingly
office
but
owing
to
the
infirm
state
of
my
father
health
neither
my
brother
robin
nor
i
could
be
spared
from
the
farm
in
any
of
the
different
raids
that
germinated
out
of
the
king
controversy
with
the
english
parliament
so
that
in
the
whigamore
expedition
as
it
was
profanely
nicknamed
from
our
shire
with
the
covenanted
earls
of
cassilis
and
eglinton
we
had
no
personality
though
our
hearts
went
with
those
that
were
therein
when
however
the
hideous
tidings
came
of
the
condemnation
and
execution
of
the
king
there
was
a
stop
in
the
current
of
men
minds
and
as
the
waters
of
jordan
when
the
ark
was
carried
in
rushed
back
to
their
every
true
scot
on
that
occasion
felt
in
his
heart
the
ancient
affections
of
his
nature
returning
with
a
compassionate
horror
yet
even
in
this
they
were
true
to
the
covenant
for
it
was
not
to
be
hidden
that
the
english
parliament
in
doing
what
it
did
in
that
tragical
event
was
guided
by
a
speculative
spirit
of
political
innovation
and
change
different
and
distinct
both
in
principle
and
object
from
the
cause
which
made
our
scottish
covenanters
have
recourse
to
arms
in
truth
the
act
of
bringing
kings
to
public
condign
punishment
was
no
such
new
thing
in
the
chronicles
of
scotland
as
that
brave
historian
george
buchanan
plainly
shows
to
have
filled
us
with
such
amazement
and
affright
had
the
offences
of
king
charles
been
proven
as
clearly
personal
as
the
crimes
for
which
the
ancient
tyrants
of
his
pedigree
suffered
the
death
but
his
offences
were
shared
with
his
counsellors
whose
duty
it
was
to
have
bridled
his
arbitrary
pretensions
he
was
in
consequence
mourned
as
a
victim
and
his
son
the
second
charles
at
once
proclaimed
and
acknowledged
king
of
scotland
how
he
deported
himself
in
that
capacity
and
what
gratitude
he
and
his
brother
showed
the
land
for
its
faith
and
loyalty
in
the
wreck
and
desperation
of
their
royal
fortunes
with
a
firm
and
a
fearless
pen
i
now
purpose
to
show
but
as
the
tale
of
their
persecutions
is
ravelled
with
the
sorrows
and
the
sufferings
of
my
friends
and
neighbours
and
the
darker
tissue
of
my
own
woes
it
is
needful
before
proceeding
therein
that
i
should
entreat
the
indulgence
of
the
courteous
reader
to
allow
a
few
short
passages
of
my
private
life
now
to
be
here
recorded
chapter
xliv
some
time
before
the
news
of
king
charles
execution
reached
us
in
the
west
the
day
had
been
set
for
my
marriage
with
sarah
lochrig
but
the
fear
and
consternation
which
the
tidings
bred
in
all
minds
many
dreading
that
the
event
would
be
followed
by
a
total
breaking
up
of
the
union
and
frame
of
society
made
us
consent
to
defer
our
happiness
till
we
saw
what
was
ordained
to
come
to
pass
when
however
it
was
seen
and
felt
that
the
dreadful
beheading
of
an
anointed
monarch
as
a
malefactor
had
scarcely
more
effect
upon
the
tides
of
the
time
than
the
death
of
a
sparrow
and
that
men
were
called
as
usual
to
their
daily
tasks
and
toils
and
that
all
things
moved
onward
in
their
accustomed
courses
and
that
laws
and
jurisdictions
and
all
the
wonted
pacts
and
processes
of
community
between
man
and
man
suffered
neither
molestation
nor
hindrance
godly
mr
swinton
bestowed
his
blessing
on
our
marriage
and
our
friends
their
joyous
countenance
at
the
wedding
feast
my
lot
was
then
full
of
felicity
and
i
had
no
wish
to
wander
beyond
the
green
valley
where
we
established
our
peaceful
dwelling
it
was
in
a
lown
holm
of
the
garnock
on
the
lands
of
quharist
a
portion
of
which
my
father
gave
me
in
tack
and
sarah
father
likewise
bestowed
on
us
seven
rigs
and
a
cow
grass
of
his
own
mailing
for
her
tocher
as
the
beginning
of
a
plenishment
to
our
young
fortunes
still
like
all
the
neighbours
i
was
deeply
concerned
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
world
of
conflicts
and
negotiations
and
this
was
not
out
of
an
idle
thirst
of
curiosity
but
from
an
interest
mingled
with
sorrows
and
affections
for
after
the
campaign
in
england
my
three
brothers
michael
william
and
alexander
never
domiciled
themselves
at
any
civil
calling
having
caught
the
roving
spirit
of
camps
they
remained
in
the
skirts
of
the
array
which
the
covenanted
lords
at
edinburgh
continued
to
maintain
and
here
poor
lads
i
may
digress
a
little
to
record
the
brief
memorials
of
their
several
unhappy
fates
when
king
charles
the
second
after
accepting
and
being
sworn
to
abide
by
the
covenant
was
brought
home
and
the
crown
of
his
ancient
progenitors
placed
upon
his
head
at
scoone
by
the
hands
of
the
marquis
of
argyle
in
the
presence
of
the
great
and
the
godly
covenanters
my
brothers
went
in
the
army
that
he
took
with
him
into
england
michael
was
slain
at
the
battle
of
worcester
by
the
side
of
sir
john
shaw
of
greenock
who
carried
that
day
the
royal
banner
alexander
was
wounded
in
the
same
fight
and
left
upon
the
field
where
he
was
found
next
morning
by
the
charitable
inhabitants
of
the
city
and
carried
to
the
house
of
a
loyal
gentlewoman
one
mrs
deerhurst
that
treated
him
with
much
tenderness
but
after
languishing
in
agony
as
she
herself
wrote
to
my
father
he
departed
this
life
on
the
third
day
of
william
i
have
sometimes
wished
that
i
had
never
heard
more
for
after
the
adversity
of
that
day
it
would
seem
he
forgot
the
covenant
and
his
father
house
ritchie
minigaff
an
old
servant
of
the
lord
eglinton
when
the
earl
his
master
was
cromwell
prisoner
in
the
tower
of
london
saw
him
there
among
the
guard
and
some
years
after
the
restoration
he
met
him
again
among
the
king
yeomen
at
westminster
about
the
time
of
the
beginning
of
the
persecution
but
willy
then
begged
ritchie
with
the
tear
in
his
eye
no
to
tell
his
father
nor
was
ever
the
old
man
heart
pierced
with
the
anguish
which
the
thought
of
such
backsliding
would
have
caused
though
he
often
wondered
to
us
at
home
with
the
anxiety
of
a
parent
wonder
what
could
have
become
of
blithe
willy
no
doubt
he
died
in
the
servitude
of
the
faithless
tyrant
but
the
storm
that
fell
among
us
soon
after
ritchie
had
told
me
of
his
unfortunate
condition
left
us
neither
time
nor
opportunity
to
inquire
about
any
distant
friend
but
to
return
to
my
own
story
from
my
marriage
till
the
persecution
began
i
took
no
part
in
the
agitations
of
the
times
it
is
true
after
the
discovery
of
charles
stuart
perfidious
policy
so
like
his
father
in
corresponding
with
the
marquis
of
montrose
for
the
subjection
of
scotland
by
the
tyranny
of
the
sword
at
the
very
time
he
was
covenanting
with
the
commissioners
sent
from
the
lords
at
edinburgh
with
the
offer
of
the
throne
of
his
ancestors
that
with
my
father
and
my
brother
robin
together
with
many
of
our
neighbours
i
did
sign
the
remonstrance
against
making
a
prince
of
such
a
treacherous
and
unprincipled
nature
king
but
in
that
we
only
delivered
reasons
and
opinions
on
a
matter
of
temporal
expediency
for
it
was
an
instrument
that
neither
contained
nor
implied
obligation
to
arm
indeed
our
deportment
bore
testimony
to
this
explanation
of
the
spirit
in
which
it
was
conceived
and
understood
for
when
the
prince
had
received
the
crown
and
accepted
the
covenant
we
submitted
ourselves
as
good
subjects
fearing
god
we
were
content
to
honour
in
all
rights
and
prerogatives
not
contrary
to
scripture
him
whom
by
his
grace
in
the
mysteries
of
his
wisdom
he
had
for
our
manifold
sins
as
a
nation
and
a
people
been
pleased
to
ordain
and
set
over
us
for
king
and
verily
no
better
test
of
our
sincerity
could
be
than
the
distrust
with
which
our
whole
was
respected
by
oliver
cromwell
when
he
thought
it
necessary
to
build
that
stronghold
at
ayr
by
which
his
englishers
were
enabled
to
hold
the
men
of
carrick
kyle
and
cunningham
in
awe
a
race
that
from
the
days
of
sir
william
wallace
and
king
robert
the
bruce
have
ever
been
found
honest
in
principle
brave
in
affection
and
dauntless
and
doure
in
battle
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
say
more
on
this
head
for
full
of
griefs
and
grudges
as
were
the
hearts
of
all
true
scots
with
the
thought
of
their
country
in
southern
thraldom
while
cromwell
englishers
held
the
upper
hand
amongst
us
the
season
of
their
dominion
was
to
me
and
my
house
as
a
lown
and
pleasant
spring
all
around
me
was
bud
and
blossom
and
juvenility
and
gladness
and
hope
my
lot
was
as
the
lot
of
the
blessed
man
i
ate
of
the
labour
of
my
hands
i
was
happy
and
it
was
well
with
me
my
wife
as
the
fruitful
vine
that
spreads
its
clusters
on
the
wall
made
my
lowly
dwelling
more
beautiful
to
the
eye
of
the
heart
than
the
golden
palaces
of
crowned
kings
and
our
pretty
bairns
were
like
olive
plants
round
about
my
table
but
they
are
all
gone
the
flood
and
the
flame
have
passed
over
them
yet
be
still
my
heart
a
little
while
endure
in
silence
for
i
have
not
taken
up
the
avenging
pen
of
history
and
dipped
it
in
the
blood
of
martyrs
to
record
only
my
own
particular
woes
and
wrongs
chapter
xlv
it
has
been
seen
by
what
i
have
told
concerning
the
part
my
grandfather
had
in
the
great
work
of
the
reformation
that
the
heads
of
the
house
of
argyle
were
among
the
foremost
and
the
firmest
friends
of
the
resuscitated
evangil
the
aged
earl
of
that
time
was
in
the
very
front
of
the
controversy
as
one
of
the
lords
of
the
congregation
and
though
his
son
the
lord
of
lorn
hovered
for
a
season
like
other
young
men
of
his
degree
in
the
purlieus
and
precincts
of
the
lady
regent
court
yet
when
her
papistical
counsels
broke
the
paction
with
the
protestants
at
perth
i
have
rehearsed
how
he
being
then
possessed
of
the
inheritance
of
his
father
dignities
did
with
the
bravery
becoming
his
blood
and
station
remonstrate
with
her
highness
against
such
impolitic
craft
and
perfidy
and
along
with
the
lord
james
stuart
utterly
eschew
her
presence
and
method
of
government
after
the
return
of
queen
mary
from
france
and
while
she
manifested
a
respect
for
the
rights
of
her
covenanted
people
that
worthy
earl
was
among
her
best
friends
and
even
after
the
dismal
doings
that
led
to
her
captivity
in
lochleven
castle
and
thence
to
the
battle
of
langside
he
still
acted
the
part
of
a
true
nobleman
to
a
sovereign
so
fickle
and
so
faithless
whether
he
rued
on
the
field
that
he
had
done
so
or
was
smitten
with
an
infirmity
that
prevented
him
from
fighting
against
his
old
friend
and
covenanted
brother
the
good
regent
murray
belongs
not
to
this
history
to
inquire
but
certain
it
is
that
in
him
the
protestant
principles
of
his
honourable
house
suffered
no
dilapidation
and
in
the
person
of
his
grandson
the
first
marquis
of
the
name
they
were
stoutly
asserted
and
maintained
when
the
first
charles
and
laud
that
ravenous
arminian
antichrist
attempted
to
subvert
and
abrogate
the
presbyterian
gospel
worship
not
only
did
the
marquis
stand
forth
in
the
van
of
the
covenanters
to
stay
the
religious
oppression
then
meditated
against
his
native
land
but
laboured
with
all
becoming
earnestness
to
avert
the
pestilence
of
civil
war
in
that
doubtless
argyle
offended
the
false
counsellors
about
the
king
but
when
the
english
parliament
with
a
lawless
arrogance
struck
off
the
head
of
the
miscounselled
and
bigoted
monarch
faithful
to
his
covenants
and
the
loyalty
of
his
race
the
marquis
was
amongst
the
foremost
of
the
scottish
nobles
to
proclaim
the
prince
of
wales
king
with
his
own
hands
he
placed
on
charles
the
second
head
the
ancient
diadem
of
scotland
surely
it
might
therefore
have
been
then
supposed
that
all
previous
offence
against
the
royal
family
was
forgotten
and
forgiven
yea
when
it
is
considered
that
general
monk
himself
the
boldest
in
the
cause
of
cromwell
usurpation
was
rewarded
with
a
dukedom
in
england
for
doing
no
more
for
the
king
there
than
argyle
had
done
for
him
before
in
greater
peril
here
it
could
not
have
entered
into
the
imagination
of
christian
men
that
argyle
for
only
submitting
like
a
private
subject
to
the
same
usurped
authority
when
it
had
become
supreme
would
after
the
restoration
be
brought
to
the
block
but
it
was
so
and
though
the
machinations
of
political
enemies
converted
that
submission
into
treasons
to
excuse
their
own
crime
yet
there
was
not
an
honest
man
in
all
the
realm
that
did
not
see
in
the
doom
of
argyle
a
dismal
omen
of
the
cloud
and
storm
which
so
soon
after
burst
upon
our
religious
liberties
passing
however
by
all
those
afflictions
which
took
the
colour
of
political
animosities
i
hasten
to
speak
of
the
proceedings
which
from
the
hour
of
the
restoration
were
hatched
for
the
revival
of
the
prelatic
oppression
the
tyranny
of
the
stuarts
is
indeed
of
so
fell
a
nature
that
having
once
tasted
of
blood
in
any
cause
it
will
return
again
and
again
however
so
often
baffled
till
it
has
either
devoured
its
prey
or
been
itself
mastered
and
so
it
showed
in
this
instance
for
regardless
of
those
troubles
which
the
attempt
of
the
first
charles
to
exercise
an
authority
in
spiritual
things
beyond
the
rights
of
all
earthly
sovereignty
caused
to
the
realm
and
to
himself
the
second
no
sooner
felt
the
sceptre
in
his
grip
than
he
returned
to
the
same
enormities
and
he
found
a
fit
instrument
in
james
sharp
who
in
contempt
of
the
wrath
of
god
sold
himself
to
antichrist
for
the
prelacy
of
st
andrews
but
it
was
not
among
the
ambitious
and
mercenary
members
of
the
clergy
that
the
evidences
of
a
backsliding
generation
were
alone
to
be
seen
many
of
the
people
nobles
and
magistrates
were
infected
with
the
sin
of
the
same
reprobation
and
in
verity
it
might
have
been
said
of
the
realm
that
the
restoration
of
king
charles
the
second
was
hailed
as
an
advent
ordained
to
make
men
forget
all
vows
sobriety
and
solemnities
it
is
however
something
to
be
said
in
commendation
of
the
constancy
of
mind
and
principle
of
our
west
country
folk
that
the
immorality
of
that
drunken
loyalty
was
less
outrageous
and
offensive
to
god
and
man
among
them
and
that
although
we
did
submit
and
were
commanded
to
commemorate
the
anniversary
of
the
king
restoration
it
was
nevertheless
done
with
humiliation
and
anxiety
of
spirit
but
a
vain
thing
it
would
be
of
me
to
attempt
to
tell
the
heartburning
with
which
we
heard
of
the
manner
that
the
covenant
and
of
all
things
which
had
been
hallowed
and
honourable
to
religious
scotland
were
treated
in
the
town
of
lithgow
on
that
occasion
although
all
of
my
grandfather
stock
knew
that
from
of
old
it
was
a
seat
and
sink
of
sycophancy
alien
to
holiness
and
prone
to
lick
the
dust
aneath
the
feet
of
whomsoever
ministered
to
the
corruption
abiding
there
had
the
general
inebriation
of
the
kingdom
been
confined
only
to
such
mockers
as
the
papistical
progeny
of
the
unregenerate
town
of
lithgow
we
might
perhaps
have
only
grieved
at
the
wantonness
of
the
world
but
they
were
soon
followed
by
more
palpable
enormities
middleton
the
king
commissioner
coming
on
a
progress
to
glasgow
held
a
council
of
state
there
at
which
was
present
the
apostate
fairfoul
who
had
been
shortly
before
nominated
archbishop
of
that
city
and
at
his
wicked
incitement
middleton
in
a
fit
of
actual
intoxication
from
strong
drink
let
loose
the
bloodhounds
of
persecution
by
that
memorable
act
of
council
which
bears
the
date
of
the
of
october
an
anniversary
that
ought
ever
to
be
held
as
a
solemn
fast
in
scotland
if
such
things
might
be
for
by
it
all
the
ministers
that
had
received
gospel
ordination
from
and
after
the
year
and
who
still
refused
to
bend
the
knee
to
baal
were
banished
with
their
families
from
their
kirks
and
manses
but
to
understand
in
what
way
that
wicked
act
and
the
proclamation
which
ensued
came
to
take
effect
it
is
needful
before
proceeding
to
the
recital
to
bid
the
courteous
reader
remember
the
preaching
of
the
doctrine
of
passive
obedience
by
our
pastor
mr
sundrum
and
how
the
kirk
was
deserted
on
that
occasion
because
after
his
death
which
happened
in
the
godly
mr
swinton
became
our
chosen
pastor
and
being
placed
and
inducted
according
to
the
apostolic
ordination
of
presbytery
fell
of
course
like
many
of
his
gospel
brethren
under
the
ban
of
the
aforesaid
proclamation
of
which
some
imperfect
sough
and
rumour
reached
us
on
the
friday
after
it
was
framed
at
first
the
particulars
were
not
known
for
it
was
described
as
the
muttering
of
unclean
spirits
against
the
purity
of
the
truth
but
the
tidings
startled
us
like
the
growl
of
some
unknown
and
dreadful
thing
and
i
dreamt
that
night
of
my
grandfather
with
his
white
hair
and
the
comely
venerableness
of
his
great
age
appearing
pale
and
sorrowful
in
a
field
before
me
and
pointing
with
a
hand
of
streaming
light
to
horsemen
and
chariots
and
armies
with
banners
warring
together
on
the
distant
hills
saturday
was
then
the
at
irvine
and
though
i
had
but
little
business
there
i
yet
went
in
with
my
brother
robin
chiefly
to
hear
the
talk
of
the
town
in
this
i
but
partook
of
the
common
sympathy
of
the
whole
for
on
entering
the
port
we
found
the
concourse
of
people
there
assembled
little
short
of
the
crowd
at
marymas
fair
and
all
eager
to
learn
what
the
council
held
at
glasgow
had
done
but
no
one
could
tell
only
it
was
known
that
the
earl
of
eglinton
who
had
been
present
at
the
council
was
returned
home
to
the
castle
and
that
he
had
sent
for
the
provost
that
morning
on
very
urgent
business
while
we
were
thus
all
speaking
and
marvelling
one
with
another
a
cry
got
up
that
a
band
of
soldiers
was
coming
into
the
town
from
ayr
the
report
of
which
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
struck
every
one
with
awe
and
apprehension
and
scarcely
had
the
sough
of
this
passed
over
us
when
it
was
told
that
the
provost
had
privately
returned
from
eglinton
castle
by
the
to
the
backsides
and
that
he
had
sent
for
the
minister
and
the
bailies
with
others
of
the
council
to
meet
him
in
the
clerk
chamber
no
one
wist
what
the
meaning
of
such
movements
and
mysteries
could
be
but
all
boded
danger
to
the
fold
and
flock
none
doubting
that
the
wolves
of
episcopalian
covetousness
were
hungering
and
thirsting
for
the
blood
of
the
covenanted
lambs
nor
were
we
long
left
to
our
guesses
for
soon
after
the
magistrates
and
the
minister
had
met
a
copy
of
the
proclamation
of
the
council
held
at
glasgow
was
put
upon
the
tolbooth
door
by
which
it
was
manifested
to
every
eye
that
the
fences
of
the
vineyard
were
indeed
broken
down
and
that
the
boar
was
let
in
and
wrathfully
trampling
down
and
laying
waste
chapter
xlvi
the
proclamation
was
as
a
stunning
blow
on
the
forehead
of
the
covenanters
and
for
the
next
two
sabbaths
mr
swinton
was
plainly
in
prayer
a
weighed
down
and
man
but
he
said
nothing
in
his
discourses
that
particularly
affected
the
marrow
of
that
sore
and
solemn
business
on
the
friday
night
however
before
the
last
day
of
that
black
october
he
sent
for
my
brother
who
was
one
of
his
elders
and
told
him
that
he
had
received
a
mandatory
for
conformity
to
the
proclamation
and
to
acknowledge
the
prelatic
reprobation
that
the
king
government
had
introduced
into
the
church
but
that
it
was
his
intention
strengthened
of
the
lord
to
adhere
to
his
vows
and
covenants
even
to
the
uttermost
and
not
to
quit
his
flock
happen
what
would
the
beild
of
the
kirk
and
the
manse
said
he
being
temporalities
are
aneath
the
power
and
regulation
of
the
earthly
monarch
but
in
the
things
that
pertain
to
the
allegiance
i
owe
to
the
king
of
kings
i
will
act
with
his
heartening
the
part
of
a
true
and
loyal
vassal
this
determination
being
known
throughout
the
parish
and
the
first
of
november
being
the
last
day
allowed
for
conforming
on
the
sabbath
preceding
we
had
a
throng
kirk
and
a
solemneezed
congregation
according
to
their
wonted
custom
the
men
before
the
hour
of
worship
assembled
in
the
and
there
was
much
murmuring
and
marvelling
among
us
that
nobody
in
all
the
land
would
stand
forth
to
renew
the
covenant
as
was
done
in
the
year
and
we
looked
around
and
beheld
the
green
graves
of
many
friends
that
had
died
since
the
great
day
of
the
covenanting
and
we
were
ashamed
of
ourselves
and
of
our
time
and
mourned
for
the
loss
of
the
brave
spirits
which
in
the
darkness
of
his
mysterious
wisdom
the
lord
had
taken
away
the
weather
for
the
season
was
bright
and
dry
and
the
withered
leaf
still
hung
here
and
there
on
the
tree
so
that
old
and
young
the
infirm
and
the
tender
could
come
abroad
and
many
that
had
been
were
supported
along
by
their
relations
to
hear
the
word
of
truth
for
the
last
time
preached
in
the
house
of
god
mr
swinton
came
followed
by
his
wife
and
family
he
was
by
this
time
a
man
well
stricken
in
years
but
mrs
swinton
was
of
a
younger
generation
and
they
had
seven
children
martha
the
eldest
a
fine
lassie
was
not
passing
fourteen
years
of
age
as
they
came
slowly
up
the
we
all
remarked
that
the
godly
man
never
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
ground
but
came
along
perusing
as
it
were
the
very
earth
for
consolation
the
private
door
which
at
that
epoch
led
to
the
minister
seat
and
the
pulpit
was
near
to
where
the
hung
on
the
outer
wall
and
as
the
family
went
towards
it
one
of
the
elders
stepped
from
the
plate
at
the
main
door
to
open
it
but
after
mrs
swinton
and
the
children
were
gone
in
the
minister
who
always
stopped
till
they
had
done
so
instead
of
then
following
paused
and
looked
up
with
a
compassionate
aspect
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
shoulder
of
old
willy
shackle
who
was
ringing
the
bell
he
said
stop
my
auld
frien
they
that
in
this
parish
need
a
bell
this
day
to
call
them
to
the
service
of
their
maker
winna
come
on
the
summons
yours
he
then
walked
in
and
the
old
man
greatly
affected
mounted
the
stool
and
tied
up
the
rope
to
the
ring
in
the
wall
in
his
usual
manner
that
it
might
be
out
of
the
reach
of
the
school
weans
but
said
he
as
he
came
down
i
needna
fash
for
after
this
day
little
care
i
wha
rings
the
bell
since
it
to
be
consecrat
to
the
wantonings
o
prelacy
i
wis
the
tongue
were
out
o
its
mouth
and
its
head
cracket
rather
than
that
i
should
live
to
in
the
service
of
baal
and
the
hoor
o
babylon
after
all
the
congregation
had
taken
their
seats
mr
swinton
rose
and
moved
towards
the
front
of
the
pulpit
and
the
silence
in
the
church
was
as
the
silence
at
the
martyrdom
of
some
holy
martyr
he
then
opened
the
book
and
having
given
out
the
psalm
we
sang
it
with
weeping
souls
and
during
the
prayer
that
followed
there
was
much
sobbing
and
lamentations
and
an
universal
sorrow
his
discourse
was
from
the
fifth
chapter
of
the
lamentations
of
jeremiah
verse
first
and
first
clause
of
the
verse
and
with
the
tongue
of
a
prophet
and
the
voice
of
an
apostle
he
foretold
as
things
already
written
in
the
chronicles
of
the
kingdom
many
of
those
sufferings
which
afterwards
came
to
pass
it
was
a
sermon
that
settled
into
the
bottom
of
the
hearts
of
all
that
heard
it
and
prepared
us
for
the
woes
of
the
vial
that
was
then
pouring
out
at
the
close
of
the
discourse
when
the
precentor
rose
to
read
the
remembering
prayer
old
ebenezer
muir
then
upwards
of
fourscore
and
thirteen
who
had
been
brought
into
the
church
on
a
barrow
by
two
of
his
grandsons
and
was
for
reason
of
his
deafness
in
the
bench
with
the
elders
gave
him
a
paper
which
after
rehearsing
the
names
of
those
in
distress
and
sickness
he
read
and
it
was
the
persecuted
kirk
of
scotland
if
i
forget
thee
o
jerusalem
let
my
right
hand
forget
her
cunning
cried
mr
swinton
at
the
words
with
an
inspiration
that
made
every
heart
dirl
and
surely
never
was
such
a
prayer
heard
as
that
with
which
he
followed
up
the
divine
words
then
we
sang
the
hundred
and
fortieth
psalm
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
minister
came
again
to
the
front
of
the
pulpit
and
with
a
calm
voice
attuned
to
by
ordinare
solemnity
he
pronounced
the
blessing
then
suddenly
turning
himself
he
looked
down
to
his
family
and
said
the
foxes
have
holes
and
the
birds
of
the
air
have
nests
but
the
son
of
man
hath
not
where
to
lay
his
head
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
sat
down
and
wept
never
shall
i
forget
the
sound
which
rose
at
that
sight
it
was
not
a
cry
of
woe
neither
was
it
the
howl
of
despair
nor
the
sob
of
sorrow
nor
the
gurl
of
wrath
nor
the
moan
of
anguish
but
a
deep
and
dreadful
rustling
of
hearts
and
spirits
as
if
the
angel
of
desolation
in
passing
by
had
shaken
all
his
wings
the
kirk
then
began
to
skail
and
when
the
minister
and
his
family
came
out
into
the
all
the
heads
of
families
present
moved
by
some
sacred
instinct
from
on
high
followed
them
with
one
accord
to
the
manse
like
friends
at
a
burial
where
we
told
them
that
whatever
the
lord
was
pleased
to
allow
to
ourselves
a
portion
would
be
set
apart
for
his
servant
i
was
the
spokesman
on
that
occasion
and
verily
do
i
think
that
as
i
said
the
words
a
glorious
light
shone
around
me
and
that
i
felt
a
fanning
of
the
inward
life
as
if
the
young
cherubims
were
present
among
us
and
fluttering
their
wings
with
an
exceeding
great
joy
at
the
piety
of
our
kind
intents
so
passed
that
memorable
sabbath
in
our
parish
and
here
i
may
relate
that
we
had
the
satisfaction
and
comfort
to
know
in
a
little
time
thereafter
that
the
same
christian
faithfulness
with
which
mr
swinton
adhered
to
his
and
character
was
maintained
on
that
day
by
more
than
three
hundred
other
ministers
to
the
perpetual
renown
of
our
national
worth
and
covenanted
cause
and
therefore
though
it
was
an
era
of
much
sorrow
and
of
many
tears
it
was
thus
through
the
mysterious
ways
of
providence
converted
into
a
ground
of
confidence
in
our
religion
in
so
much
that
it
may
be
truly
said
out
of
the
ruins
and
the
overthrow
of
the
first
presbyterian
church
the
lord
built
up
among
us
a
stronghold
and
sanctuary
for
his
truth
and
law
chapter
xlvii
nothing
particular
happened
till
the
second
week
of
november
when
a
citation
came
from
irvine
commanding
the
attendance
of
mr
swinton
on
a
suffragan
of
fairfoul
under
the
penalties
of
the
proclamation
in
the
meantime
we
had
been
preparing
for
the
event
and
my
father
having
been
some
time
no
more
and
my
brother
with
his
family
in
a
house
of
their
own
it
was
settled
between
him
and
me
that
i
should
take
our
mother
into
mine
in
order
that
the
beild
of
quharist
might
be
given
up
to
the
minister
and
his
houseless
little
ones
which
all
our
neighbours
much
commended
and
there
was
no
slackness
on
their
part
in
making
a
provision
to
supply
the
want
of
his
impounded
stipend
as
all
had
foreseen
mr
swinton
for
not
appearing
to
the
citation
was
pronounced
a
and
the
same
night
after
dusk
a
party
of
the
soldiers
that
were
marched
from
ayr
into
irvine
on
the
day
of
the
proclamation
came
to
drive
him
out
of
the
manse
there
was
surely
in
this
a
needless
and
exasperating
severity
for
the
light
of
day
might
have
served
as
well
but
the
men
were
not
to
blame
and
the
officer
who
came
with
them
having
himself
been
tried
in
the
battles
of
the
covenant
and
being
of
a
humane
spirit
was
as
meek
and
compassionate
in
his
tyrannical
duty
as
could
reasonably
be
hoped
for
he
allowed
mrs
swinton
to
take
away
her
clothes
and
the
babies
that
were
asleep
in
their
beds
time
to
be
awakened
and
dressed
nor
did
he
object
to
their
old
ploughman
robin
harrow
taking
sundry
articles
of
provision
for
their
next
morning
repast
so
that
compared
with
the
lewd
riots
and
rampageous
insolence
of
the
troopers
in
other
places
we
had
great
reason
to
be
thankful
for
the
tenderness
with
which
our
minister
and
his
small
family
of
seven
children
were
treated
on
that
memorable
night
it
was
about
eight
when
martha
the
eldest
daughter
came
flying
to
me
like
a
demented
creature
crying
the
persecutors
were
come
with
naked
swords
and
dreadful
faces
and
she
wept
and
wrung
her
hands
thinking
they
were
then
murdering
her
parents
and
brothers
and
sisters
i
did
however
all
that
was
in
my
power
to
pacify
her
saying
our
lots
were
not
yet
laid
in
blood
and
leaving
her
to
the
consolatory
counsellings
of
my
wife
i
put
on
my
bonnet
and
hastened
over
to
the
manse
the
night
was
troubled
and
gusty
the
moon
was
in
her
first
quarter
and
wading
dim
and
low
through
the
clouds
on
the
arran
hills
afar
off
the
bars
of
ayr
in
their
roaring
boded
a
storm
and
the
stars
were
rushing
through
a
swift
and
showery
carry
the
wind
as
it
hissed
over
the
stubble
sounded
like
the
whisperings
of
desolation
and
i
was
thrice
startled
in
my
walk
by
passing
shapes
and
shadows
whereof
i
could
not
discern
the
form
at
a
short
distance
from
the
manse
door
i
met
the
godly
sufferer
and
his
destitute
family
with
his
second
youngest
child
in
his
arms
mrs
swinton
had
their
baby
at
her
bosom
and
the
other
four
poor
terrified
helpless
creatures
were
hirpling
at
their
sides
holding
them
by
the
skirts
and
often
looking
round
in
terror
dreading
the
persecutors
by
whom
they
were
in
that
dismal
and
inclement
night
so
cast
upon
the
mercy
of
the
elements
but
he
that
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
was
their
protector
you
see
ringan
gilhaize
said
the
minister
how
it
fares
with
them
in
this
world
whose
principles
are
at
variance
with
the
pretensions
of
man
but
we
are
mercifully
dealt
by
a
rougher
manner
and
a
harder
heart
in
the
agent
of
persecution
that
has
driven
us
from
house
and
home
i
had
laid
my
account
for
therefore
even
in
this
dispensation
i
can
see
the
gentle
hand
of
a
gracious
master
and
i
bow
the
head
of
thankfulness
while
we
were
thus
speaking
and
walking
towards
quharist
several
of
the
neighbours
who
had
likewise
heard
the
alarm
of
what
had
thus
come
to
pass
joined
us
on
the
way
and
i
felt
within
myself
that
it
was
a
proud
thing
to
be
able
to
give
refuge
and
asylum
to
an
aged
gospel
minister
and
his
family
in
such
a
time
and
on
such
a
night
we
had
not
been
long
in
the
house
when
a
great
concourse
of
his
friends
and
people
gathered
around
and
among
others
nahum
chapelrig
who
had
been
some
time
his
father
successor
in
the
school
but
all
present
were
molested
and
angry
with
him
for
he
came
in
battle
array
with
the
sword
and
gun
that
he
had
carried
in
the
raids
of
the
civil
war
and
was
bragging
of
valorous
things
then
needful
to
be
done
nahum
chapelrig
said
the
worthy
to
him
with
severity
this
is
no
conduct
for
the
occasion
it
would
hae
been
a
black
day
for
scotland
had
her
children
covenanted
themselves
for
temporal
things
no
nahum
if
the
prelatic
reprobation
now
attempted
on
the
kirk
gang
nae
farther
than
outing
her
ministers
from
their
kirks
and
manses
it
maun
be
tholet
so
look
to
it
that
ye
give
not
the
adversary
cause
to
reproach
us
with
longing
for
the
of
egypt
when
we
are
free
to
taste
of
the
heavenly
manna
i
redde
ye
therefore
nahum
chapelrig
before
these
witnesses
to
unbuckle
that
belt
of
war
and
lay
down
thae
weapons
of
offence
the
time
of
the
shield
and
banner
may
come
owre
soon
upon
us
let
us
not
provoke
the
smiter
lest
he
draw
his
sword
against
us
and
have
law
and
reason
on
his
side
therefore
i
say
unto
thee
peter
put
up
thy
sword
the
zealous
dominie
being
thus
timeously
rebuked
unharnessed
himself
and
the
minister
having
returned
thanks
for
the
softness
with
which
the
oppression
was
let
down
upon
him
and
for
the
pious
affection
of
his
people
we
returned
home
to
our
respective
dwellings
but
though
by
this
christian
submission
the
power
of
cruelty
was
at
that
time
rendered
innocent
towards
all
those
who
did
as
mr
swinton
had
done
we
were
nevertheless
not
allowed
to
remain
long
unvisited
by
another
swirl
of
the
rising
storm
before
the
year
was
out
fairfoul
the
glasgow
antichrist
sent
upon
us
one
of
the
getts
that
prelacy
was
then
so
fast
adopting
for
her
sons
and
heirs
a
lang
thin
bare
lad
he
was
that
had
gotten
some
spoonful
or
two
of
pagan
philosophy
at
college
but
never
a
solid
meal
of
learning
nor
were
we
to
judge
by
his
greedy
gaping
even
a
satisfactory
meal
of
victuals
his
name
was
andrew
dornock
and
poor
fellow
being
eschewed
among
us
on
account
of
his
spiritual
leprosy
he
drew
up
with
divers
loose
characters
that
were
nae
overly
nice
of
their
company
this
made
us
dislike
him
more
and
more
in
so
much
that
like
others
of
his
nature
and
calling
he
made
sore
and
secret
complaints
of
his
parishioners
to
his
mitred
master
representing
for
aught
i
ken
to
the
contrary
that
instead
of
believing
the
gospel
according
to
charles
stuart
we
preferred
that
of
certain
four
persons
called
matthew
mark
luke
and
john
of
whom
it
may
be
doubted
if
he
poor
man
knew
more
than
the
names
but
be
that
as
it
may
to
a
surety
he
did
grievously
yell
and
cry
because
we
preferred
listening
to
the
gospel
melody
of
mr
swinton
under
a
tree
to
his
feckless
havers
in
the
kirk
as
if
it
was
nae
a
more
glorious
thing
to
worship
god
in
the
freedom
and
presence
of
universal
nature
beneath
the
canopy
of
all
the
heavens
than
to
bow
the
head
in
the
fetters
of
episcopal
bondage
below
the
stoury
rafters
of
an
auld
bigging
such
as
our
kirk
was
a
perfect
howf
of
cloks
and
spiders
indeed
for
that
matter
it
was
said
that
the
only
sensible
thing
andrew
dornock
ever
uttered
from
the
pulpit
was
when
he
first
rose
to
speak
therein
and
which
was
caused
by
a
spider
that
just
at
the
moment
lowered
itself
down
into
his
mouth
o
lord
cried
the
curate
puzhened
wi
speeders
chapter
xlviii
it
might
have
been
thought
considering
the
poor
hand
which
the
prelatic
curates
made
of
it
in
their
endeavours
to
preach
that
they
would
have
set
themselves
down
content
with
the
stipend
and
allowed
the
flocks
to
follow
their
own
shepherds
in
peace
but
their
hearts
were
filled
with
the
bitterness
of
envy
at
the
sight
of
the
multitudes
that
went
forth
to
gather
the
manna
in
the
fields
and
their
malice
was
exasperated
to
a
wonderful
pitch
of
wickedness
by
the
derision
and
contempt
with
which
they
found
themselves
regarded
no
one
among
them
all
however
felt
this
envy
and
malice
more
stirring
within
him
than
did
the
james
sharp
for
the
faithfulness
of
so
many
ministers
was
a
terror
and
a
reproach
to
his
conscience
and
apostacy
and
made
him
labour
with
an
exceeding
zeal
and
animosity
to
extirpate
so
many
evidences
of
his
own
religious
guilt
accordingly
by
his
malignant
counsellings
edicts
and
decrees
came
out
against
our
tabernacle
in
the
wilderness
and
under
the
opprobrious
name
of
conventicles
our
holy
meetings
were
made
prohibited
offences
and
our
ministers
subjected
to
pains
and
penalties
as
sowers
of
sedition
it
is
a
marvellous
thing
to
think
of
the
madness
with
which
the
minds
of
those
in
authority
at
that
time
were
kindled
first
to
create
causes
of
wrong
to
the
consciences
of
the
people
and
afterwards
to
enact
laws
for
the
natural
fruit
of
that
frantic
policy
the
wanton
imposition
of
the
prelatic
oppression
begat
our
field
preachings
and
the
attempts
to
disperse
us
by
the
sword
brought
on
resistance
but
it
belongs
not
to
me
and
my
story
to
treat
of
the
folly
of
a
race
and
government
upon
whom
a
curse
was
so
manifestly
pronounced
i
shall
therefore
return
from
this
generality
to
those
particulars
wherein
i
was
myself
a
witness
or
a
sufferer
during
the
greater
part
of
the
year
after
the
banishment
of
mr
swinton
from
the
manse
and
kirk
we
met
with
little
molestation
but
from
time
to
time
rumours
came
over
us
like
the
first
breathings
of
the
cold
blasts
in
autumn
that
forerun
the
storms
of
winter
all
thoughts
of
innocent
pastimes
and
pleasures
passed
away
like
the
yellow
leaves
that
fall
from
the
melancholy
trees
and
there
was
a
heaviness
in
the
tread
and
a
solemnity
in
the
looks
of
every
one
that
showed
how
widely
the
shadows
of
coming
woes
were
darkening
the
minds
of
men
but
though
the
court
of
commission
which
the
apostate
james
sharp
procured
to
be
established
for
the
cognisance
of
those
who
refused
to
acknowledge
the
prelatic
usurpation
was
in
its
proceedings
guided
by
as
little
truth
or
principle
as
the
spanish
inquisition
the
violence
and
tyranny
of
its
awards
fell
less
on
those
of
my
degree
than
on
the
gentry
and
it
was
not
till
the
drunkard
turner
was
appointed
general
of
the
west
country
that
our
personal
sufferings
began
the
curates
furnished
him
with
lists
of
recusants
and
power
having
been
given
unto
him
to
torment
men
for
many
days
he
was
as
remorseless
as
james
sharp
own
court
in
the
fines
which
he
levied
and
in
eating
the
people
up
by
sending
his
men
to
live
upon
them
at
free
quarters
till
the
fines
were
paid
in
our
neighbourhood
we
were
for
some
time
gently
dealt
with
for
the
colonel
who
at
ayr
had
the
command
under
turner
was
of
a
humane
spirit
and
for
a
season
though
the
rumour
of
the
oppressions
in
and
galloway
where
the
drunkard
himself
reigned
and
ruled
dismayed
and
troubled
us
beyond
utterance
we
were
still
permitted
to
taste
of
the
gospel
pastures
with
our
own
faithful
shepherd
but
this
was
a
blessing
too
great
in
those
days
to
be
of
a
continuance
to
any
flock
the
mild
and
considerate
gentleman
who
had
softened
the
rigour
of
the
prelatic
rage
was
removed
from
his
command
and
in
his
place
came
certain
cruel
officers
who
like
the
serpents
that
were
sent
among
the
children
of
israel
in
the
desert
defiled
our
dwellings
and
afflicted
many
of
us
even
unto
death
the
change
was
the
more
bitterly
felt
because
it
was
sudden
and
came
upon
us
in
an
unexpected
manner
of
which
i
will
here
set
down
some
of
the
circumstantials
according
to
the
usage
among
us
from
the
time
when
mr
swinton
was
thrust
from
the
ministry
the
parish
had
assembled
on
the
third
day
of
may
in
the
year
under
the
big
at
zachariah
smylie
gable
and
which
has
ever
since
been
reverenced
by
the
name
of
the
poopit
tree
a
cart
served
him
for
the
place
of
lecture
and
exhortation
and
zachariah
smylie
daughter
rebecca
armour
a
godly
widow
who
resided
with
him
had
as
her
custom
was
in
fine
weather
ordered
and
arranged
all
the
stools
and
chairs
in
the
house
with
the
milk
and
upside
down
around
the
cart
as
seats
for
the
aged
when
the
day
was
wet
or
bleak
the
worship
was
held
in
the
barn
but
on
this
occasion
the
morning
was
lown
and
the
lift
clear
and
the
natural
quietude
of
the
sabbath
reigned
over
all
the
fields
we
had
sung
a
portion
of
the
psalm
and
the
harmonious
sound
of
voices
and
spirits
in
unison
was
spreading
into
the
tranquil
air
as
the
pleasant
fragrancy
of
flowers
diffuses
itself
around
and
the
tune
to
which
we
sung
the
divine
inspiration
was
the
sweet
and
solemn
melody
of
the
martyrs
scarcely
however
had
we
proceeded
through
the
second
verse
when
mr
swinton
who
was
sitting
on
a
stool
in
the
cart
with
his
back
to
the
house
started
up
and
said
christians
dinna
be
disheartened
but
i
think
i
see
yonder
the
glimmerin
of
spears
coming
atween
the
hedges
at
these
words
we
all
rose
alarmed
and
on
looking
round
saw
some
eight
or
ten
soldiers
in
the
path
leading
from
the
high
road
coming
towards
us
the
children
and
several
of
the
women
moved
to
run
away
but
mr
swinton
rebuked
their
timerarious
fear
and
said
o
ye
of
little
faith
wherefore
are
ye
thus
dismayed
let
us
put
our
trust
in
him
who
is
mightier
than
all
the
armies
of
all
the
kings
of
all
the
earth
we
are
here
doing
homage
to
him
and
he
will
protect
his
true
vassals
and
faithful
people
in
his
name
therefore
christians
i
charge
you
to
continue
his
praises
in
the
psalm
for
in
his
strength
i
will
to
the
end
of
my
intent
this
day
fulfil
the
word
and
the
admonition
yea
even
in
the
very
flouting
of
the
adversary
banner
the
vehemence
of
elijah
was
in
his
voice
we
resumed
our
former
postures
and
he
himself
leading
on
the
psalm
we
began
to
sing
anew
in
a
louder
strain
for
we
were
fortified
and
encouraged
by
his
holy
intrepidity
no
one
moved
as
it
were
an
eyelid
the
very
children
were
steadfast
and
all
looked
towards
the
man
of
god
as
he
sat
in
his
humble
seat
serene
and
more
awful
than
ever
was
solomon
on
the
royal
throne
of
the
golden
lions
arrayed
in
all
his
glory
the
rough
soldiers
were
struck
for
a
time
with
amazement
at
the
religious
bravery
with
which
the
worshipping
was
continued
and
they
halted
as
they
drew
near
and
whispered
together
and
some
of
them
spoke
as
if
the
fear
of
the
lord
had
fallen
upon
them
during
the
whole
time
that
we
continued
singing
they
stood
as
if
they
durst
not
venture
to
disturb
us
but
when
the
psalm
was
finished
their
sergeant
a
lewd
roister
swore
at
them
and
called
on
them
to
do
their
duty
the
men
then
advanced
but
with
one
accord
we
threw
ourselves
in
between
them
and
the
cart
and
cried
to
mr
swinton
to
make
his
escape
he
however
rose
calmly
from
his
seat
and
said
soldiers
shed
no
blood
let
us
finish
our
prayer
the
worst
of
men
after
condemnation
are
suffered
to
pray
ye
will
therefore
not
surely
refuse
harmless
christians
the
boon
that
is
to
malefactors
at
the
conclusion
i
will
go
peaceably
with
you
for
we
are
not
rebels
we
yield
all
bodily
obedience
to
the
powers
that
be
but
the
upright
mind
will
not
bend
to
any
earthly
ordinance
our
bodies
are
subject
to
the
king
authority
and
to
you
as
his
servants
if
ye
demand
them
we
are
ready
to
deliver
them
up
but
the
sergeant
told
him
harshly
to
make
haste
and
come
down
from
the
cart
two
of
the
men
then
went
into
the
house
and
brought
out
the
churn
and
bread
and
cheese
and
with
much
ribaldry
began
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
speak
profane
jests
to
the
young
women
but
my
brother
interposed
and
advised
all
the
women
and
children
to
return
to
their
homes
in
the
meantime
zachariah
smylie
had
gone
to
the
stable
and
saddled
his
horse
and
rebecca
armour
had
made
a
small
providing
of
provisions
for
mr
swinton
to
take
with
him
to
the
tolbooth
of
irvine
for
thither
the
soldiers
were
intending
to
carry
him
that
night
in
order
that
he
might
be
sent
to
glasgow
next
day
with
other
sufferers
when
however
the
horse
was
brought
out
and
the
godly
man
was
preparing
to
mount
the
sergeant
took
him
by
the
sleeve
and
pulled
him
back
saying
the
horse
is
for
me
verily
at
this
insult
i
thought
my
heart
would
have
leapt
out
and
every
one
present
gurled
and
growled
but
the
soldiers
laughed
at
seeing
the
sergeant
on
horseback
mr
swinton
however
calmly
advised
us
to
make
no
obstacle
good
said
he
will
come
of
this
and
though
for
a
season
we
are
ordained
to
tribulation
and
to
toil
through
the
slough
of
despond
yet
a
firm
footing
and
a
fair
and
green
path
lies
in
a
peaceful
land
beyond
the
soldiers
then
took
him
away
the
blasphemous
sergeant
riding
like
a
merry
andrew
on
zachariah
smylie
horse
before
them
and
almost
the
whole
congregation
following
with
mournful
and
heavy
hearts
chapter
xlix
the
testimony
of
the
regard
and
respect
which
we
showed
to
mr
swinton
in
following
him
to
the
was
wickedly
reported
against
us
as
a
tumult
and
a
riot
wearing
the
aspect
of
rebellion
and
accordingly
on
the
second
day
after
he
was
sent
from
irvine
to
glasgow
a
gang
of
turner
worst
troopers
came
to
live
at
heck
and
manger
among
us
none
suffered
more
from
those
ruthless
men
than
did
my
brother
house
and
mine
for
our
name
was
honoured
among
the
true
and
faithful
and
we
had
committed
the
unpardonable
sin
against
the
prelacy
of
harbouring
our
minister
and
his
destitute
family
when
they
were
driven
from
their
home
in
a
wild
and
wintry
night
we
were
both
together
with
old
zachariah
smylie
fined
each
in
a
heavy
sum
thinking
that
by
paying
the
money
down
we
should
rid
ourselves
and
our
neighbours
of
the
presence
and
burden
of
the
devouring
soldiery
our
friends
to
enable
us
made
a
gathering
among
them
and
brought
us
the
means
for
we
had
not
a
sufficiency
of
our
own
but
this
instead
of
mitigating
the
oppression
became
a
reason
with
the
officer
set
over
us
to
persecute
us
still
more
for
he
pretended
to
see
in
that
neighbourliness
the
evidences
of
a
treasonous
combination
so
that
he
not
only
took
the
money
but
made
a
pretext
of
the
readiness
with
which
it
was
paid
to
double
his
severity
sixteen
domineering
camp
reprobates
were
quartered
on
four
honest
families
and
five
of
them
were
on
mine
what
an
example
their
conduct
and
conversation
was
at
my
sober
hearth
i
need
not
attempt
to
describe
for
some
days
they
rampaged
as
if
we
had
been
barbarians
and
the
best
in
the
house
was
not
good
enough
for
their
ravenous
wastrie
but
i
was
resolved
to
keep
a
uniform
and
steady
abstinence
from
all
cause
of
offence
so
seeing
they
were
passing
from
insolence
into
a
strain
of
familiarity
towards
my
wife
and
her
two
we
gave
up
the
house
and
made
our
abode
in
the
barn
this
silent
rebuke
for
some
time
was
not
without
a
wholesome
effect
and
in
the
end
they
were
so
far
tamed
into
civility
by
our
blameless
and
peaceful
demeanour
that
i
could
discern
more
than
one
of
them
beginning
to
be
touched
with
the
humanity
of
respect
for
our
unmerited
punishment
but
their
officer
lieutenant
swaby
an
englisher
by
birth
and
a
sinner
by
education
was
of
an
incorrigible
depravity
of
heart
he
happened
to
cast
his
eye
on
martha
swinton
the
minister
eldest
daughter
then
but
in
her
sixteenth
year
and
notwithstanding
the
sore
affliction
that
she
was
in
with
her
mother
on
account
of
her
godly
father
uncertain
fate
he
spared
no
stratagem
to
lure
her
to
his
wicked
will
she
was
however
strengthened
against
his
arts
and
machinations
but
her
fortitude
instead
of
repressing
the
rigour
of
his
persecutions
only
made
him
more
audacious
in
so
much
that
she
was
terrified
to
trust
herself
unguarded
out
of
the
house
and
the
ire
of
every
man
and
woman
was
rising
against
the
sensual
swaby
who
was
so
destitute
of
grace
and
human
charity
but
out
of
this
a
mean
was
raised
that
in
the
end
made
him
fain
to
be
removed
from
among
us
for
all
the
immoral
bravery
of
the
rampant
soldiery
and
especially
of
their
libertine
commander
they
had
not
been
long
among
us
till
it
was
discerned
that
they
were
as
much
under
the
common
fears
and
superstitions
as
the
most
credulous
of
our
simple
country
folk
in
so
much
that
what
with
our
family
devotions
and
the
tales
of
witches
and
warlocks
with
which
every
one
as
if
by
concert
delighted
to
awe
them
they
were
loth
to
stir
out
of
their
quarters
after
the
gloaming
swaby
however
though
less
under
those
influences
than
his
men
nevertheless
partook
largely
of
them
and
would
not
at
the
king
commands
it
was
thought
have
crossed
the
at
midnight
but
though
he
was
thus
infirm
with
the
dread
of
evil
spirits
he
was
not
daunted
thereby
from
ill
purposes
and
having
one
day
fallen
in
with
old
mysie
gilmour
on
the
road
a
pawkie
carlin
of
a
jocose
nature
he
entered
into
a
blethering
discourse
with
her
anent
divers
things
and
from
less
to
more
propounded
to
honest
mysie
that
she
should
lend
a
cast
of
her
skill
to
bring
about
a
secret
meeting
between
him
and
the
bonny
defenceless
martha
swinton
mysie
gilmour
was
a
christian
woman
and
her
soul
was
troubled
with
the
proposal
to
herself
and
for
the
peril
with
which
she
saw
her
daughter
environed
but
she
put
on
the
mask
of
a
light
hypocrisy
and
said
she
would
maybe
do
something
if
he
fee
her
well
making
a
tryst
with
him
for
the
day
following
purposing
in
the
meanwhile
instead
of
furthering
his
wicked
ends
to
devise
with
the
counselling
of
some
of
her
acquaintances
in
what
manner
she
could
take
revenge
upon
the
profligate
prodigal
for
having
thought
so
little
of
her
principle
merely
because
she
was
a
lanerly
widow
bent
with
age
and
poortith
among
others
that
she
conferred
with
was
one
robin
finnie
a
lad
who
when
a
callan
had
been
drummer
to
the
host
that
nahum
chapelrig
led
in
the
times
of
the
civil
war
to
the
raid
of
he
was
sib
to
herself
had
a
spice
of
her
pawkrie
and
was
moreover
though
not
without
a
leavening
of
religion
a
fellow
fain
at
any
time
for
a
spree
besides
which
he
had
from
the
campaigns
of
his
youth
brought
home
a
and
a
derisive
opinion
of
the
cavaliers
taking
all
seasons
and
occasions
to
give
vent
to
the
same
and
he
never
called
swaby
by
any
other
name
than
the
cavalier
between
mysie
and
robin
with
some
of
his
companions
a
paction
was
made
that
she
should
keep
her
tryst
with
swaby
and
settle
on
a
time
and
place
for
him
to
come
to
the
delusion
of
expecting
to
find
martha
swinton
robin
covenanting
that
between
him
and
his
friends
the
cavalier
should
meet
with
a
lemane
worthy
of
his
love
accordingly
at
the
time
appointed
when
she
met
swaby
on
the
road
where
they
had
foregathered
the
day
before
she
trysted
him
to
come
to
her
house
on
which
happened
to
be
then
at
hand
and
to
be
sure
no
to
bring
his
sword
or
any
weapon
that
might
breed
mischief
after
parting
from
him
the
cavalier
going
one
way
and
the
carlin
the
other
robin
finnie
threw
himself
in
his
way
and
going
up
to
him
with
a
seeming
respectfulness
said
ye
were
speaking
sir
to
yon
auld
wife
i
hope
ye
hae
her
nae
offence
the
look
with
which
robin
looked
at
swaby
as
he
said
this
dismayed
the
gallant
cavalier
who
cried
gazing
back
at
mysie
who
was
hirpling
homeward
the
devil
is
she
one
of
that
sort
i
no
say
what
she
is
nor
what
others
say
o
her
replied
robin
with
solemnity
but
ye
no
fare
the
waur
that
ye
stand
weel
in
her
liking
swaby
halted
and
again
looked
towards
the
old
woman
who
was
then
nearly
out
of
sight
robin
at
the
same
time
moved
onward
friend
cried
the
cavalier
stop
i
must
have
some
talk
with
you
about
the
old
whisht
exclaimed
robin
she
deevilish
gleg
o
the
hearing
i
would
na
for
twenty
merks
she
jealoused
that
i
had
telt
you
to
take
tent
her
cantrips
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
a
witch
said
swaby
in
a
low
and
apprehensive
voice
i
would
na
say
sic
a
thing
o
her
for
the
world
replied
robin
very
seriously
i
would
expek
to
hae
a
prosperous
hour
in
this
world
were
i
to
ca
honest
mysie
gilmour
onything
sae
uncanny
she
a
pious
wife
sir
deed
is
she
me
ca
her
a
witch
she
would
deserve
to
be
hang
if
she
was
a
witch
an
it
could
be
proven
upon
her
but
these
assurances
gave
no
heartening
to
the
gallant
cavalier
on
the
contrary
he
looked
like
one
that
was
perplexed
and
said
devil
take
her
i
wish
i
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
her
do
cried
robin
sir
she
an
auld
withered
hag
would
spean
a
foal
surely
she
did
na
sae
beglamour
your
senses
as
to
appear
like
a
winsome
young
lass
but
i
hae
heard
o
sic
morphosings
i
no
say
howsever
that
honest
mysie
ever
tried
her
art
sae
far
and
what
i
hae
heard
tell
of
was
done
in
the
cruelty
of
jealously
but
it
no
possible
captain
that
ye
were
making
up
to
auld
mysie
for
the
love
o
peace
an
ye
were
sae
deluded
say
nothing
about
it
for
either
the
parish
will
say
that
ye
hae
an
unco
taste
or
that
mysie
has
cast
her
cantrips
your
judgment
the
whilk
would
either
make
you
a
or
gin
ye
could
prove
that
she
kithed
afore
you
like
a
blooming
damsel
bring
her
to
the
wuddy
so
i
redde
ye
captain
to
let
this
story
gang
nae
farther
but
mind
what
i
hae
been
saying
keep
weel
wi
her
as
ye
respek
yoursel
in
saying
these
words
robin
turned
hastily
into
the
wynd
that
led
to
the
clachan
laughing
in
his
sleeve
leaving
the
brave
cavalier
in
a
sore
state
o
dread
and
wonderment
chapter
l
it
seems
that
shortly
after
robin
finnie
had
departed
from
the
gallant
cavalier
a
lad
called
sandy
macgill
who
was
colleagued
with
him
in
the
plot
came
towards
the
captain
with
looks
cast
to
the
earth
and
so
full
of
thought
that
he
seemingly
noticed
nothing
going
forward
in
this
state
of
the
outward
sense
he
came
close
upon
swaby
when
affecting
to
be
startled
out
of
his
meditations
he
stopped
suddenly
short
and
looked
in
the
lieutenant
broad
face
with
all
the
alarm
he
could
put
into
his
own
features
till
he
saw
he
was
frightened
out
of
his
judgment
when
he
said
gude
be
about
us
sir
ye
hae
gotten
scaith
the
blighting
blink
o
an
ill
has
lighted
upon
o
sir
o
sir
tak
tent
o
yoursel
sandy
had
prepared
a
deal
more
to
say
but
finding
himself
overcome
with
an
inward
inclination
to
risibility
at
the
sight
of
terrification
he
was
obligated
to
flee
as
fast
as
he
could
from
the
spot
the
which
action
of
his
no
doubt
dismayed
the
cavalier
fully
as
meikle
as
all
he
had
said
but
it
the
nature
of
man
to
desire
to
do
whatever
he
is
forbidden
notwithstanding
all
their
mystical
admonitions
swaby
still
persevered
in
his
evil
intents
and
accordingly
he
was
seen
lurking
without
his
sword
about
the
heel
of
the
evening
on
near
the
skirts
of
the
clachan
where
mysie
gilmour
lived
and
as
it
had
been
conspired
among
her
friends
mungo
affleck
her
a
man
weel
stricken
in
years
but
of
a
youthy
mind
and
a
perfect
at
a
crack
came
across
the
cavalier
in
his
path
and
swaby
having
before
some
slight
acquaintance
with
his
garb
and
canny
observes
hovered
for
a

exploit
on
which
the
cavalier
was
then
bowne
it
no
to
be
thought
that
this
was
very
heartening
music

benweed
ponies

saddled
for
yon
awfu
carnavaulings
where
cluty
plays
on
the
pipes
so
i
wis
you
sir
gude
night
and
weel
o
sir
an
ye
could
be
persuaded
tak
an
auld
man
advice
and
rather
read
a
chapter
of
the
book
an
it
should
even
be
the
unedyfying
tenth
of
nehemiah
than
be
seen
at
the
gloaming
in
this
gait
about
the
like
a
wolf
yearning
for
some
tender
lamb
of
a
defenceless
fold
mungo
having
thus
delivered
himself
went
away
leaving
swaby
as
it
were
in
a
swither
for
on
looking
back
the
old
man
saw
him
standing
half
turned
round
as
if
he
was
minded
to
go
home
the
power
of
the
sin
was
however
strong
upon
him
and
shortly
after
the
dusk
had
closed
in
when
the
angels
had
lighted
their
candles
at
their
windows
in
the
sky
to
watch
over
the
world
in
the
hours
of
sleep
swaby
with
stealthy
steps
came
to
mysie
gilmour
door
and
softly
tirling
at
the
pin
was
admitted
for
all
within
was
ready
for
his
reception
robin
finnie
and
sandy
macgill
having
carried
thither
zachariah
black
ram
a
condumacious
and
outstropolous
beast
which
they
had
laid
in
mysie
bed
and
keepit
frae
baaing
with
a
gude
fothering
of
and
a
cloute
soaken
in
milk
mysie
on
opening
the
door
said
to
the
gallant
cavalier
just
step
in
ye
fin
a
ready
and
she
blew
out
her
crusie
which
she
had
in
her
hand
and
letting
the
captain
grope
in
by
himself
hirpled
as
fast
as
she
could
to
one
of
the
neighbours
for
although
she
had
covenanted
with
him
to
come
without
his
sword
she
was
terrified
with
the
fear
of
some
dreadful
upshot
as
soon
as
he
was
in
robin
finnie
and
sandy
macgill
went
and
hearkened
at
the
window
where
they
heard
the
gay
gallant
stumbling
in
the
floor
churming
sweet
and
amorous
words
as
he
went
groping
his
way
towards
the
bed
where
the
auld
toop
was
breathing
thickly
mumbling
and
crunching
the
in
a
state
of
as
great
sensual
delight
and
satisfaction
as
any
beast
could
well
be
but
no
sooner
had
the
cavalier
placed
his
hand
on
the
horned
head
of
the
creature
than
he
uttered
a
yell
of
despair
in
the
same
moment
the
toop
in
little
less
fright
jumpit
out
of
the
bed
against
him
and
knocked
him
down
over
a
stool
with
a
lounder
verily
providence
might
be
said
with
reverence
to
have
had
a
hand
in
the
mirth
of
his
punishment
for
the
ram
recovering
its
senses
before
the
cavalier
and
being
in
dread
of
danger
returned
to
the
charge
and
began
to
butt
him
as
if
it
would
have
been
his
death
the
cries
that
ensued
are
not
to
be
told
all
the
neighbours
came
running
to
the
door
to
see
what
was
the
matter
some
with
lighted
sticks
in
their
hands
and
some
with
burning
coals
in
the
tongs
robin
finnie
and
sandy
macgill
were
like
to
die
of
laughing
but
fearing
the
wrathful
ram
might
dunt
out
the
bowels
or
the
brains
if
he
had
any
of
the
poor
young
cavalier
they
opened
the
door
and
so
delivered
him
from
its
horns
he
was
however
by
this
time
almost
in
a
state
of
distraction
believing
the
beast
was
the
real
evil
one
so
that
he
no
sooner
felt
himself
free
and
saw
the
lights
than
he
flew
to
his
quarters
as
if
he
had
been
pursued
by
a
legion
some
of
his
own
soldiers
that
were
lying
in
the
clachan
and
who
had
come
out
with
the
rest
of
the
folk
saw
through
the
stratagem
and
forgetting
all
reverence
for
their
afflicted
commander
laughed
louder
and
longer
than
any
body
in
short
the
story
was
the
whole
parish
next
day
and
the
very
weans
wherever
the
cavalier
appeared
used
to
cry
ba
at
him
by
which
his
very
life
was
made
a
shame
and
a
burden
to
him
insomuch
that
he
applied
for
leave
to
give
up
his
commission
and
returned
home
to
his
kindred
in
the
south
of
england
and
we
never
heard
tell
of
him
after
chapter
li
but
although
in
the
exploit
of
mysie
gilmour
and
robin
finnie
with
his
confederates
we
had
a
tasting
of
mirth
and
merriment
to
the
effect
of
lessening
the
dread
and
fear
in
which
our
simple
country
folk
held
his
majesty
ungracious
the
cavalier
captains
and
soldiers
still
there
was
a
gradual
ingrowth
of
the
weight
of
the
oppression
wherewith
we
were
laden
more
as
bondsmen
and
slaves
than
as
subjects
and
in
the
meantime
the
spirit
of
that
patriarch
my
apostolic
grandfather
was
gathering
to
heart
and
energy
within
the
silent
recesses
of
my
afflicted
bosom
i
heard
the
murmuring
deep
and
sad
of
my
neighbours
at
the
insult
and
the
contumely
which
they
were
obligated
to
endure
from
the
irresponsible
licentiousness
of
military
domination
but
i
said
nothing
i
was
driven
with
my
pious
wife
and
our
simple
babies
from
my
own
hearth
by
the
lewd
conversation
of
the
commissioned
freebooters
and
obligated
to
make
our
home
in
an
outhouse
that
we
might
not
be
molested
in
our
prayers
by
their
wicked
ribaldry
but
i
said
nothing
i
saw
my
honest
neighbours
plundered
their
sons
insulted
and
their
daughters
put
to
shame
but
i
said
nothing
i
was
a
witness
when
our
godly
minister
after
having
been
driven
with
his
wife
and
family
out
to
the
mercy
of
the
winter
wind
was
seized
in
the
very
time
while
he
was
worshipping
the
maker
of
us
all
and
taken
like
a
malefactor
to
prison
but
i
said
nothing
and
i
was
told
the
story
of
the
machinations
against
his
innocent
virgin
daughter
when
she
was
left
defenceless
among
us
and
still
i
said
nothing
like
the
icy
winter
tyranny
had
so
encrusted
my
soul
that
my
taciturnity
seemed
as
hard
impenetrable
cold
and
cruel
as
the
frozen
river
surface
but
the
stream
of
my
feelings
ran
stronger
and
fiercer
beneath
and
the
time
soon
came
when
in
proportion
to
the
still
apathy
that
made
my
brother
and
my
friends
to
wonder
how
i
so
quietly
bore
the
events
of
so
much
my
inward
struggles
burst
through
all
outward
passive
forms
and
like
the
hurling
and
the
drifting
ice
found
no
effectual
obstacle
to
its
irresistible
and
natural
destination
mrs
swinton
the
worthy
lady
of
that
saint
our
pastor
on
hearing
what
had
been
plotted
against
the
chaste
innocence
of
her
fair
and
blooming
child
came
to
me
and
with
tears
in
a
sense
the
tears
of
a
widow
very
earnestly
entreated
of
me
that
i
would
take
the
gentle
martha
to
her
cousin
the
laird
of
garlins
in
she
having
heard
that
some
intromissions
arising
out
of
pacts
and
covenants
between
my
cousin
and
the
laird
of
barscob
obligated
me
to
go
thither
this
was
on
the
monday
after
the
battering
that
the
cavalier
got
from
zachariah
smylie
black
ram
and
i
reasonably
thinking
that
there
was
judgment
in
the
request
and
that
i
might
serve
by
my
compliance
the
helpless
residue
and
the
objects
of
a
persecuted
christian
affections
i
consented
to
take
the
damsel
with
me
as
far
as
garlins
in
galloway
the
which
i
did
when
i
had
left
martha
swinton
with
her
friends
who
being
persons
of
pedigree
and
opulence
were
better
able
to
guard
her
i
went
to
the
end
of
my
own
journey
and
here
from
what
ensued
it
is
needful
i
should
relate
that
in
this
undertaking
i
left
my
own
house
under
the
care
of
my
brother
and
that
i
was
armed
with
my
grandfather
sword
it
happened
that
on
tuesday
the
november
as
i
was
returning
homeward
from
barscob
i
fell
in
with
three
godly
countrymen
about
a
mile
south
of
the
village
of
dalry
in
galloway
and
we
entered
into
a
holy
and
most
salutary
conversation
anent
the
sufferings
and
the
fortitude
of
god
people
in
that
time
of
trouble
discoursing
with
great
sobriety
on
that
melancholious
theme
we
met
a
gang
of
blackcuffs
driving
before
them
like
beasts
to
the
slaughter
several
miserable
persons
to
thrash
out
the
corn
that
it
might
be
sold
of
one
of
my
companions
who
being
himself
a
persecuted
man
and
unable
to
pay
the
fine
forfeited
by
his
piety
had
some
days
before
been
forced
to
flee
his
house
on
seeing
the
soldiers
and
their
prey
coming
towards
us
the
poor
man
would
have
run
away
but
we
exhorted
him
not
to
be
afraid
for
he
might
pass
unnoticed
and
so
he
did
for
although
those
whom
the
military
rabiators
were
driving
to
thrash
his
corn
knew
him
well
they
were
enabled
to
bear
up
and
were
so
endowed
with
the
strength
of
martyrdom
that
each
of
them
only
by
a
look
signified
that
they
were
in
the
spirit
of
fellowship
with
him
after
they
had
gone
by
his
heart
however
was
so
afflicted
that
so
many
worthy
persons
should
be
so
harmed
for
his
sake
that
he
turned
back
and
in
despite
of
all
our
entreaties
went
to
them
while
we
went
forward
to
dalry
where
we
entered
a
small
public
and
having
ordered
some
refreshment
for
we
were
all
weary
we
sat
meditating
on
what
could
be
the
upshot
of
such
tyranny
while
we
were
so
sitting
a
cry
got
up
that
our
companion
was
seized
by
the
soldiers
and
that
they
were
tormenting
him
on
a
gridiron
for
not
having
paid
his
fine
my
blood
boiled
at
the
news
i
rose
and
those
who
were
with
me
followed
and
we
ran
to
the
house
his
own
house
where
the
poor
man
was
i
beseeched
two
of
the
soldiers
who
were
at
the
door
to
desist
from
their
cruelty
but
while
i
was
speaking
other
two
that
were
within
came
raging
out
like
curs
from
a
kennel
and
flew
at
me
and
one
of
them
dared
to
strike
me
with
his
nieve
in
the
mouth
my
grandfather
sword
flew
out
at
the
blow
and
the
insulter
lay
wounded
and
bleeding
at
my
feet
my
companions
in
the
same
moment
rushed
on
the
other
soldiers
dashed
their
teeth
down
their
throats
and
twisting
their
firelocks
from
their
hands
set
the
prisoner
free
in
this
there
was
rashness
but
there
was
also
redemption
and
glory
we
could
not
stop
at
what
we
had
done
we
called
on
those
who
had
been
brought
to
thrash
the
corn
to
join
with
us
and
they
joined
we
hastened
to
the
next
farm
the
spirit
of
indignation
was
there
before
us
and
master
and
man
and
father
and
son
there
likewise
found
that
the
hilts
of
their
fathers
covenanted
swords
fitted
their
avenging
grasps
we
had
now
fired
the
dry
stubble
of
the
land
the
flame
spread
we
advanced
and
grew
stronger
and
stronger
the
hills
as
it
were
clapped
their
hands
and
the
valleys
shouted
of
freedom
from
all
sides
men
and
horse
came
exulting
towards
us
the
gentleman
and
the
hind
knew
no
distinction
the
cry
was
down
with
tyranny
we
are
and
we
will
make
free
the
fields
rejoiced
with
the
multitude
of
our
feet
as
we
advanced
towards
dumfries
where
turner
lay
his
blackcuffs
flung
down
their
arms
and
implored
our
mercy
we
entered
dumfries
and
the
oppressor
was
our
prisoner
chapter
lii
hitherto
the
rising
at
dalry
had
been
as
a
passion
and
a
spreading
fire
the
strength
of
the
soldiers
was
consumed
before
us
and
their
arms
became
our
weapons
but
when
we
had
gained
possession
of
dumfries
and
had
set
a
ward
over
the
house
where
we
had
seized
turner
i
saw
that
we
had
waded
owre
far
into
the
river
to
think
of
returning
and
that
to
go
on
was
safer
than
to
come
back
it
was
indeed
manifest
that
we
had
been
triumphant
rather
by
our
haste
than
by
the
achievements
of
victorious
battle
and
it
could
be
hidden
from
no
man
thought
that
the
power
and
the
vengeance
both
of
the
government
and
the
prelacy
would
soon
be
set
in
array
against
us
i
therefore
bethought
myself
in
that
peril
of
our
lives
and
cause
of
two
things
which
seemed
most
needful
first
not
to
falter
in
our
enterprise
until
we
had
proved
the
utmost
of
the
pleasure
in
our
behalf
and
second
to
use
the
means
under
him
which
in
all
human
undertakings
are
required
to
bring
whatsoever
is
ordained
to
pass
whether
in
these
things
i
did
well
or
wisely
i
leave
to
the
adjudication
of
the
courteous
reader
but
i
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
heart
and
say
aloud
yea
even
to
the
holy
skies
i
thought
not
of
myself
nor
of
mine
but
only
of
the
religious
rights
of
my
countrymen
from
the
moment
in
which
i
received
the
blow
of
the
soldier
up
till
the
hour
when
turner
was
taken
i
had
been
the
head
and
leader
of
the
people
my
sword
was
never
out
of
my
grip
and
i
marched
as
it
were
in
a
path
of
light
so
wonderful
was
the
immediate
instinct
with
which
i
was
directed
to
the
accomplishment
of
that
adventure
the
success
of
which
overwhelmed
the
fierce
and
cruel
antichrists
at
edinburgh
with
unspeakable
consternation
and
panic
but
i
lacked
that
knowledge
of
the
art
of
war
by
which
men
are
banded
into
companies
and
ruled
however
manifold
their
diversities
to
one
end
and
effect
so
that
our
numbers
having
by
this
time
increased
to
a
great
multitude
i
felt
myself
utterly
unable
to
govern
them
we
were
as
a
sea
of
billows
that
move
onward
all
in
one
way
obedient
to
the
impulse
and
deep
fetchings
of
the
tempestuous
breath
of
the
awakened
winds
of
heaven
but
which
often
break
into
foam
and
waste
their
force
in
a
roar
of
ineffectual
rage
seeing
this
and
dreading
the
consequences
thereof
i
conferred
with
some
of
those
whom
i
had
observed
the
most
discreet
and
considerate
in
the
course
of
the
raid
and
we
came
to
a
resolve
to
constitute
and
appoint
captain
learmont
our
chief
commander
he
having
earned
an
experience
of
the
art
and
stratagems
of
war
under
the
renowned
lesley
had
we
abided
by
that
determination
some
have
thought
our
expedition
might
have
come
to
a
happier
issue
but
no
human
helps
and
means
could
change
what
was
evidently
ordained
otherwise
it
happened
however
that
colonel
wallace
another
officer
of
some
repute
also
joined
us
and
his
name
made
him
bright
and
resplendent
to
our
enthusiasm
while
we
were
deliberating
whom
to
choose
for
our
leader
colonel
wallace
was
in
the
same
breath
for
his
name
sake
proposed
and
was
united
in
the
command
with
learmont
this
was
a
deadly
error
and
ought
in
all
time
coming
to
be
a
warning
and
an
admonition
to
people
and
nations
in
their
straits
and
difficulties
never
to
be
guided
in
the
weighty
shocks
and
controversies
of
disordered
fortunes
by
any
prejudice
or
affection
so
unsubstantial
as
the
echo
of
an
honoured
name
for
this
wallace
though
a
man
of
questionless
bravery
and
a
gentleman
of
good
account
among
all
who
knew
him
had
not
received
any
gift
from
nature
of
that
spirit
of
masterdom
without
which
there
can
be
no
command
so
that
he
was
no
sooner
appointed
to
lead
us
on
with
learmont
as
his
second
than
his
mind
fell
into
a
strange
confusion
and
he
heightened
disorder
into
anarchy
by
ordering
over
much
we
could
not
however
undo
the
evil
without
violating
the
discipline
that
we
were
all
conscious
our
forces
so
grievously
lacked
but
from
the
very
moment
that
i
saw
in
what
manner
he
took
upon
him
the
command
i
augured
of
nothing
but
disaster
learmont
was
a
collected
and
an
urbane
character
and
did
much
to
temper
and
turn
aside
the
thriftless
ordinances
of
his
superior
he
seeing
how
much
our
prosperity
was
dependent
on
the
speed
with
which
we
could
reach
edinburgh
hastened
forward
everything
with
such
alacrity
that
we
were
ready
on
the
morrow
by
to
set
out
from
dumfries
but
the
element
of
discord
was
now
in
our
cause
and
i
was
reproached
by
many
for
having
abdicated
my
natural
right
to
the
command
it
was
in
vain
that
i
tried
to
redeem
the
fault
by
taking
part
with
learmont
under
the
determination
when
the
black
hour
of
defeat
or
dismay
should
come
upon
us
to
take
my
stand
with
him
and
regardless
of
wallace
to
consider
him
as
the
chief
and
champion
of
our
covenanted
liberties
but
why
do
i
dwell
on
these
intents
let
me
hasten
to
describe
the
upshot
of
our
enterprise
as
soon
as
we
had
formed
in
the
manner
herein
related
something
like
a
head
and
council
for
ourselves
we
considered
before
leaving
dumfries
what
ought
to
be
done
with
general
turner
and
ordered
him
to
be
brought
before
us
for
those
who
had
suffered
from
his
fell
orders
and
licentious
soldiery
were
clamorous
for
his
blood
but
when
the
man
was
brought
in
he
was
so
manifestly
mastered
by
his
wine
as
his
vice
often
made
him
that
we
thought
it
would
be
as
it
were
to
ask
a
man
mad
or
possessed
to
account
for
his
actions
as
at
that
time
to
put
the
frantic
drunkard
on
his
defence
so
we
heeded
not
his
obstreperous
menaces
but
ordered
him
to
be
put
into
bed
and
his
papers
to
be
searched
for
and
laid
before
us
in
this
moderation
there
was
wisdom
for
by
dealing
so
gently
by
one
who
had
proved
himself
so
ruthless
an
agent
of
the
prelatic
aggressions
we
bespoke
the
good
opinion
even
of
many
among
our
adversaries
and
in
the
end
it
likewise
proved
a
measure
of
justice
as
well
as
of
mercy
for
on
examining
his
papers
it
appeared
that
pitiless
as
his
domineering
had
been
it
was
far
short
of
the
universal
cruelty
of
his
instructions
from
the
apostate
james
sharp
and
those
in
the
council
with
him
who
had
delivered
themselves
over
as
instruments
to
the
arbitrary
prerogatives
and
tyrannous
pretensions
of
the
court
we
therefore
resolved
to
proceed
no
farther
against
him
but
to
keep
him
as
an
hostage
in
our
hands
many
however
among
the
commonalty
complained
of
our
lenity
for
they
had
endured
in
their
persons
their
gear
and
their
families
great
severities
and
they
grudged
that
he
was
not
obligated
to
taste
the
bitterness
of
the
cup
of
which
he
had
forced
them
to
drink
so
deeply
in
the
meantime
all
the
country
became
alive
with
the
news
of
our
exploit
the
covenanters
of
the
shire
of
ayr
headed
by
several
of
their
ejected
ministers
whom
they
had
cherished
in
the
solitary
dens
and
hidings
in
the
moors
and
hills
to
which
they
had
been
forced
to
flee
from
the
proclamation
against
the
advanced
to
meet
us
on
our
march
verily
it
was
a
sight
that
made
the
heart
of
man
dinle
at
once
with
gladness
and
sorrow
to
behold
as
the
day
dawned
on
our
course
in
crossing
the
wide
and
lonely
wilderness
of
those
religious
brethren
coming
towards
us
moving
in
silence
over
the
heath
like
the
shadows
of
the
clouds
of
the
summer
sky
as
we
were
toiling
through
the
deep
heather
on
the
eastern
skirts
of
the
a
mist
hovered
all
the
morning
over
the
pad
of
neilston
covering
like
a
snowy
fleece
the
sides
of
the
hills
down
almost
to
the
course
of
our
route
in
such
a
manner
that
we
could
see
nothing
on
the
left
beyond
it
we
were
then
within
less
than
fourteen
miles
of
glasgow
where
general
dalziel
lay
with
the
king
forces
keeping
in
thraldom
the
godly
of
that
pious
city
and
its
neighbourhood
captain
learmont
well
aware
from
the
eager
character
of
the
man
that
he
would
be
fain
to
intercept
us
and
fearful
of
being
drawn
into
jeopardy
by
the
mist
persuaded
wallace
to
halt
us
some
time
as
november
was
far
advanced
it
was
thought
by
the
country
folk
that
the
mist
would
clear
away
about
noon
we
accordingly
made
a
pause
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
for
many
were
weary
having
themselves
in
their
zeal
to
come
up
with
the
main
body
and
we
all
stood
in
need
of
rest
scarcely
however
had
we
cast
ourselves
in
a
desultory
manner
on
the
heather
when
some
one
heard
the
thud
of
a
distant
drum
in
the
mist
and
gave
the
alarm
at
which
we
all
again
suddenly
started
to
our
feet
and
listening
were
not
long
left
in
doubt
of
the
sound
orders
were
accordingly
given
to
place
ourselves
in
array
for
battle
and
while
we
were
obeying
the
command
in
the
best
manner
our
little
skill
allowed
the
beating
of
the
drum
came
louder
and
nearer
intermingled
with
the
shrill
of
the
spirity
fife
every
one
naturally
thought
of
the
king
forces
and
the
reverend
semple
seeing
that
we
were
in
some
measure
prepared
to
meet
them
stepped
out
in
front
with
all
his
worthy
brethren
in
the
camp
and
having
solemneezed
us
for
worship
gave
out
a
psalm
by
the
time
we
had
sung
the
first
three
verses
the
drum
and
fife
sounded
so
near
that
i
could
discern
they
played
the
tune
of
john
come
kiss
me
now
which
left
me
in
no
doubt
that
the
soldiers
in
the
mist
were
my
own
friends
and
neighbours
for
it
was
the
same
tune
which
was
played
when
the
men
of
our
parish
went
to
the
raid
of
and
which
in
memorial
of
that
era
had
been
preserved
as
a
sacred
melody
amongst
us
being
thus
convinced
i
stepped
out
from
my
place
to
the
ministers
and
said
they
are
friends
that
are
coming
the
worship
was
in
consequence
for
a
short
space
suspended
and
i
presently
after
saw
my
brother
at
the
head
of
our
neighbours
coming
out
of
the
cloud
whereupon
i
went
forward
to
meet
him
and
we
shook
hands
sorrowfully
this
is
an
unco
thing
ringan
were
his
first
words
but
it
the
lord
will
and
he
is
able
to
work
out
a
great
salvation
i
made
no
answer
but
inquiring
for
my
family
of
whom
it
was
a
cheering
consolation
to
hear
as
blithe
an
account
as
could
reasonably
be
hoped
for
i
walked
with
him
to
our
captains
and
made
him
known
to
them
as
my
brother
chapter
liii
saving
the
innocent
alarm
of
the
drum
in
the
mist
our
march
to
lanerk
was
without
hinderance
or
molestation
and
when
we
arrived
there
it
was
agreed
and
set
forth
on
the
exhortation
of
the
ministers
who
were
with
us
that
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
should
be
publicly
renewed
and
to
the
end
that
no
one
might
misreport
the
spirituality
of
our
zeal
and
intents
a
protestation
was
likewise
published
wherein
we
declared
our
adherence
and
allegiance
to
the
king
undiminished
in
all
temporalities
that
we
had
been
driven
to
seek
redress
by
the
sword
for
oppressions
so
grievous
that
they
could
be
no
longer
endured
and
that
all
we
asked
and
sought
for
was
the
of
the
presbyterian
liberty
of
worship
and
the
restoration
of
our
godly
pastors
to
their
gospel
rights
and
privileges
the
morrow
after
was
appointed
for
the
covenanting
and
to
be
held
as
a
day
of
fasting
and
humiliation
for
our
own
sins
which
had
provoked
the
lord
to
bring
us
into
such
state
of
peril
and
suffering
and
it
was
a
sacred
consolation
as
mr
semple
showed
in
his
discourse
on
the
occasion
that
in
all
our
long
and
painful
travels
from
dumfries
we
had
been
guided
from
the
commission
of
any
offence
even
towards
those
whose
hearts
were
not
with
us
and
had
been
brought
so
far
on
our
way
as
blameless
as
a
peaceable
congregation
going
in
the
lown
of
a
sabbath
morning
to
worship
their
maker
in
the
house
of
prayer
but
neither
the
sobriety
of
our
demeanour
nor
the
honest
protestation
of
our
cause
had
any
effect
on
the
obdurate
heart
of
the
apostate
james
sharp
who
happened
by
reason
of
the
lord
rothes
going
to
london
to
be
then
in
the
chief
chair
of
the
at
edinburgh
he
knew
the
deserts
of
his
own
guilt
and
he
hated
us
even
unto
death
for
the
woes
he
had
made
us
suffer
the
sough
therefore
of
our
approach
was
to
the
consternation
of
his
conscience
as
the
sound
of
the
wheels
of
an
avenging
god
groaning
heavily
in
their
coming
with
the
weight
of
the
engines
of
wrath
and
doom
some
said
that
he
sat
in
the
midst
of
the
counsellors
like
a
demented
man
and
others
that
he
was
seen
flying
to
and
fro
wringing
his
hands
and
weeping
and
wailing
and
gnashing
his
teeth
but
though
all
power
of
forethought
and
policy
was
taken
from
him
there
were
others
of
the
council
who
being
less
guilty
were
more
governed
and
they
took
measures
to
defend
the
capital
against
us
they
commanded
the
gates
to
be
fenced
with
cannon
and
working
on
the
terrors
of
the
inhabitants
with
fearful
falsehoods
of
crimes
that
were
never
committed
thereby
caused
them
to
band
themselves
for
the
protection
of
their
lives
and
property
while
they
interdicted
them
from
all
egress
in
so
much
that
many
who
were
friendly
to
us
were
frustrated
in
their
desire
to
come
with
the
aid
of
their
helps
and
means
the
tidings
of
the
preparations
for
the
security
of
edinburgh
with
the
unhappy
divisions
and
continual
controversies
in
our
councils
between
the
captains
and
the
ministers
anent
the
methods
of
conducting
the
raid
had
even
before
we
left
lanerk
bred
much
sedition
among
us
and
an
ominous
dubiety
of
success
nevertheless
our
numbers
continued
to
increase
and
we
went
forward
in
such
a
commendable
order
of
battle
that
had
the
lord
been
pleased
with
our
undertaking
there
was
no
reason
to
think
the
human
means
insufficient
for
the
end
but
in
the
mysteries
of
the
depths
of
his
wisdom
he
had
judged
and
for
the
great
purposes
of
his
providence
he
saw
that
it
was
meet
we
should
yet
suffer
accordingly
even
while
we
were
issuing
forth
from
the
port
of
the
town
the
face
of
the
heavens
became
overcast
and
a
swift
carry
and
a
rising
wind
were
solemn
intimations
to
my
troubled
spirit
that
the
heartening
of
his
countenance
went
no
farther
with
us
at
that
time
nor
indeed
could
less
than
a
miracle
in
our
behalf
have
availed
for
the
year
was
old
in
november
the
corn
was
stacked
the
leaf
fallen
and
nature
in
outcast
nakedness
sat
like
the
widows
of
the
martyrs
forlorn
on
the
hills
her
head
was
bound
with
the
cloud
and
she
mourned
over
the
desolation
that
had
sent
sadness
and
silence
into
all
her
pleasant
places
as
we
advanced
the
skies
lowered
and
the
blast
raved
in
the
leafless
boughs
sometimes
a
passing
shower
as
it
travelled
in
the
storm
trailed
its
watery
skirts
over
our
disheartened
host
quenching
the
zeal
of
many
and
ever
and
anon
the
angry
riddlings
of
the
cruel
hail
still
more
and
more
exasperated
our
discontent
i
observed
that
the
men
began
to
turn
their
backs
to
the
wind
and
to
look
wistfully
behind
and
to
mutter
and
murmur
to
one
another
but
still
we
all
advanced
gradually
however
falling
into
separate
bands
and
companies
like
the
ice
of
the
river
stream
breaking
asunder
in
a
thaw
in
the
afternoon
the
fits
of
the
wind
became
less
vehement
the
clouds
were
gathered
more
compactly
together
and
the
hail
had
ceased
but
the
rain
was
lavished
without
measure
the
roads
became
sloughs
our
feet
were
drawn
heavily
out
of
the
clay
the
burns
and
brooks
raged
from
bank
to
brae
and
the
horses
swithered
at
the
fords
in
so
much
that
towards
the
gloaming
when
we
were
come
to
bathgate
several
of
our
broken
legions
were
seen
far
behind
and
when
we
halted
for
the
night
scarcely
more
than
half
the
number
with
whom
we
had
that
morning
left
lanerk
could
be
mustered
and
few
of
those
who
had
fallen
behind
came
up
but
still
captain
learmont
thought
that
as
soon
as
the
men
had
taken
some
repose
after
that
toilsome
march
we
should
advance
outright
to
edinburgh
wallace
however
objected
and
that
night
was
spent
between
them
and
the
ministers
in
thriftless
debate
moreover
our
hardships
were
increased
for
by
the
prohibition
of
the
against
the
egress
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
city
we
were
as
i
have
said
disappointed
of
the
provisions
and
succour
we
had
trusted
to
receive
from
them
and
there
was
no
hope
in
our
camp
but
only
bitterness
of
spirit
and
the
breathings
of
despair
seeing
what
no
man
could
hide
from
his
reason
our
cause
abandoned
of
the
lord
i
retired
from
the
main
body
of
the
host
and
sat
alone
on
a
rock
musing
with
a
sore
heart
on
all
that
had
come
so
rashly
to
pass
it
was
then
the
last
hour
of
the
gloaming
and
every
thing
around
was
dismayed
and
dishevelled
the
storm
had
abated
and
the
rain
was
over
but
the
darkness
of
the
night
was
closing
fast
in
and
we
were
environed
with
perils
a
cloud
like
the
blackness
of
a
hung
over
our
camp
the
stars
withheld
their
light
and
the
windows
of
the
castle
shone
with
the
candles
of
our
enemies
who
safe
in
their
stronghold
were
fresh
in
strength
and
ready
for
battle
i
thought
of
my
home
of
the
partner
of
my
anxieties
and
cares
of
the
children
of
our
love
and
of
the
dangers
of
their
defencelessness
and
i
marvelled
with
a
weeping
spirit
at
the
manner
in
which
i
had
been
snatched
up
and
brought
as
it
were
in
a
whirlwind
to
be
an
actor
in
a
scene
of
such
inevitable
woe
sometimes
in
the
passion
of
that
grief
i
was
tempted
to
rise
and
moved
to
seek
my
way
back
to
the
nest
of
my
affections
but
as
often
as
the
thought
came
over
my
heart
with
its
soft
and
fond
enticements
some
rustle
in
the
camp
of
the
weary
men
who
had
borne
in
the
march
all
that
i
had
borne
and
many
of
them
in
the
cause
far
more
yea
even
to
the
martyrdom
of
dear
friends
i
bowed
my
head
and
prayed
for
constancy
of
purpose
and
fortitude
of
mind
if
the
arm
of
flesh
was
ordained
to
be
the
means
of
rescuing
the
gospel
and
delivering
poor
scotland
from
prelatic
tyranny
and
the
thraldom
of
an
usurpation
in
the
kingly
power
while
i
was
thus
sitting
in
this
sad
and
solitary
state
none
doubting
that
before
another
night
our
covenanted
army
would
be
as
the
hail
that
smote
so
sorely
on
our
march
seen
no
more
and
only
known
to
have
been
by
the
track
of
its
course
on
the
fields
over
which
we
had
passed
a
light
broke
in
upon
the
darkness
of
my
soul
and
amidst
high
and
holy
experiences
of
consolation
mingled
with
awe
and
solemn
wonder
i
beheld
as
it
were
a
bright
and
shining
hand
draw
aside
the
curtain
of
time
and
disclose
the
blessings
of
truth
and
liberty
that
were
ordained
to
rise
from
the
fate
of
the
oppressors
who
in
the
pride
and
panoply
of
arbitrary
power
had
so
thrown
down
the
temple
of
god
and
laid
waste
his
vineyard
i
saw
that
from
our
hasty
enterprise
they
would
be
drawn
to
commit
still
more
grievous
aggressions
and
thereby
incur
some
fearful
forfeiture
of
the
honours
and
predominancy
of
which
they
had
for
so
many
years
shown
themselves
so
unworthy
and
i
had
a
foretaste
in
that
hour
of
the
fulfilment
of
my
grandfather
prophecy
concerning
the
tasks
that
were
in
store
for
myself
in
the
deliverance
of
my
native
land
so
that
although
i
rose
from
the
rock
whereon
i
was
sitting
in
the
clear
conviction
that
our
array
would
be
scattered
like
chaff
before
the
wind
i
yet
had
a
blessed
persuasion
that
the
event
would
prove
in
the
end
a
link
in
the
chain
or
a
cog
in
the
wheel
of
the
hidden
enginery
with
which
providence
works
good
out
of
evil
chapter
liv
in
the
course
of
the
night
shortly
after
the
third
watch
had
been
set
some
of
those
who
had
tarried
by
the
way
came
to
the
camp
with
the
tidings
that
dalziel
and
all
the
royal
forces
in
glasgow
were
coming
upon
us
this
though
foreseen
caused
a
great
panic
and
a
council
of
war
consisting
as
usual
of
ministers
and
officers
was
held
to
determine
what
should
be
done
but
it
was
likewise
as
usual
only
a
fruitless
controversy
i
however
on
this
occasion
feeling
myself
sustained
in
spirit
by
the
assurances
i
had
received
in
my
meditations
on
the
rock
ventured
to
speak
my
mind
freely
which
was
to
the
effect
that
taking
our
dejected
condition
the
desertion
of
our
friends
and
our
disappointments
from
the
city
into
consideration
we
could
do
no
better
thing
than
evade
the
swords
of
our
adversaries
by
disbanding
ourselves
that
each
might
be
free
to
seek
safety
for
himself
many
were
inclined
to
this
counsel
and
i
doubt
not
it
would
have
been
followed
but
while
conferring
together
an
officer
came
from
the
to
propose
a
cessation
of
arms
till
our
demands
could
be
considered
it
was
manifest
that
this
was
a
wily
stratagem
to
keep
us
in
the
snare
till
dalziel
had
time
to
come
up
and
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
make
the
council
see
it
in
the
same
light
but
there
was
a
blindness
of
mind
among
us
and
the
greater
number
thought
it
augured
a
speedy
redress
of
the
wrongs
for
which
we
had
come
to
seek
reparation
nor
did
their
obstinacy
in
this
relax
till
next
morning
when
instead
of
anything
like
their
improbable
hopes
came
a
proclamation
ordering
us
to
disperse
and
containing
neither
promise
of
indemnity
nor
of
pardon
but
then
it
was
too
late
dalziel
was
in
sight
his
army
was
coming
like
a
stream
along
the
foot
of
the
we
saw
his
banners
and
the
glittering
of
his
arms
and
the
sound
of
his
musicants
came
swelling
on
the
breeze
it
was
plain
that
his
purpose
was
to
drive
us
in
towards
the
town
but
had
we
dispersed
we
might
even
then
have
frustrated
his
intent
there
happened
however
besides
learmont
and
wallace
to
be
several
officers
among
us
who
had
stubborn
notions
of
military
honour
and
they
would
not
permit
so
a
flight
there
were
also
divers
heated
and
fanatical
spirits
whom
because
our
undertaking
had
been
for
religious
ends
nothing
could
persuade
that
providence
would
not
interfere
in
some
signal
manner
for
their
deliverance
yea
even
to
the
overthrow
of
the
enemy
and
mr
whamle
a
minister
one
of
these
getting
upon
the
top
of
the
rock
where
i
had
sat
the
night
before
began
to
preach
of
the
mighty
things
that
the
lord
did
for
the
children
of
israel
in
the
valley
of
ajalon
where
he
not
only
threw
down
great
stones
from
the
heavens
but
enabled
joshua
to
command
the
sun
and
moon
to
stand
still
which
to
any
composed
mind
was
melancholious
to
hear
in
sequence
to
these
divisions
and
contrarieties
which
enchanted
us
to
the
spot
dalziel
considering
that
we
were
minded
to
give
him
battle
brought
on
his
force
and
it
is
but
due
to
the
renown
of
the
valour
of
those
present
to
record
that
notwithstanding
a
fearful
odds
our
men
having
the
vantage
ground
so
stoutly
maintained
their
station
that
we
repulsed
him
thrice
but
the
victory
as
i
have
said
was
not
ordained
for
us
in
the
afternoon
dalziel
was
reinforced
by
several
score
of
mounted
gentlemen
from
the
adjacent
counties
and
with
their
horse
about
sunset
our
phalanx
was
shattered
our
ranks
broken
and
then
we
began
to
quit
the
field
the
number
of
our
slain
and
of
those
who
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
did
not
in
the
whole
exceed
two
hundred
men
the
dead
might
have
been
greater
but
for
the
compassion
of
the
gentlemen
who
had
respect
to
the
cause
which
had
provoked
us
to
arms
and
who
instead
of
doing
as
dalziel
men
did
without
remorse
or
pity
cried
to
the
fugitives
to
flee
and
spared
many
in
consideration
of
the
common
wrongs
when
i
saw
that
our
host
was
dashed
into
pieces
and
the
fragments
scattered
over
the
fields
i
fled
with
the
flying
and
gained
with
about
some
thirty
other
fugitives
the
brow
of
a
steep
part
of
the
where
the
mounted
gentlemen
even
had
they
been
inclined
could
not
easily
follow
us
there
while
we
halted
to
rest
a
little
we
heard
a
shout
now
and
then
rise
startling
from
the
field
of
battle
below
but
night
coming
on
all
was
soon
silent
and
we
sat
in
the
holiness
of
our
in
silent
rumination
till
the
moon
rolling
slowly
from
behind
arthur
seat
looked
from
her
window
in
the
clouds
as
if
to
admonish
us
to
flee
farther
from
the
scene
of
danger
the
reverend
mr
witherspoon
being
among
us
was
the
first
to
feel
the
gracious
admonition
and
rising
from
the
ground
he
said
friends
we
must
not
tarry
here
the
hunters
are
forth
and
we
are
the
prey
they
pursue
they
will
track
us
long
and
the
hounds
are
not
of
a
nature
to
lose
scent
especially
when
they
have
tasted
as
they
have
done
this
day
the
rich
blood
of
the
faithful
and
the
true
therefore
let
us
depart
but
where
o
where
shall
we
find
a
home
to
receive
us
where
a
place
of
rest
for
our
weary
limbs
or
a
safe
stone
for
a
pillow
to
our
aching
heads
but
why
do
i
doubt
blameless
as
we
are
even
before
man
of
all
offence
save
that
of
seeking
leave
to
worship
god
according
to
our
conscience
it
can
not
be
that
we
shall
be
left
without
succour
no
my
friends
though
our
bed
be
the
damp
grass
and
our
coverlet
the
cloudy
sky
our
food
the
haws
of
the
hedge
and
our
drink
the
drumly
burn
we
have
made
for
our
hearts
the
of
religious
faith
and
have
found
a
banquet
for
our
spirits
in
the
ambrosial
truths
of
the
gospel
luxuries
that
neither
a
james
sharp
nor
a
charles
stuart
can
ever
enjoy
nor
all
the
rents
and
revenues
fines
and
forfeitures
which
princes
may
exact
and
prelates
yearn
to
partake
of
can
buy
he
then
offered
up
a
thanksgiving
that
we
had
been
spared
from
the
sword
in
the
battle
after
which
we
shook
hands
in
silence
together
and
each
pursued
his
own
way
mr
witherspoon
lingered
by
my
side
as
we
descended
the
hill
and
i
discerned
that
he
was
inclined
to
be
my
companion
so
we
continued
together
stretching
towards
the
in
order
to
fall
into
the
lithgow
road
being
mindet
to
pass
along
the
skirts
of
stirlingshire
thence
into
lennox
in
the
hope
of
reaching
argyle
country
by
the
way
of
the
ferry
of
balloch
but
we
had
owre
soon
a
cruel
cause
to
change
the
course
of
our
flight
in
coming
down
towards
the
we
saw
a
man
running
before
us
in
the
glimpse
of
the
moonshine
and
it
was
natural
to
conclude
from
his
gestures
and
the
solitude
of
the
place
that
no
one
could
be
so
at
such
a
time
but
some
poor
from
where
the
battle
was
fought
so
we
called
to
him
to
stop
and
to
fear
no
ill
for
we
were
friends
still
however
he
fled
on
and
heeded
not
our
entreaty
which
made
us
both
marvel
and
resolve
to
overtake
him
we
thought
it
was
not
safe
to
follow
long
an
unknown
person
who
was
so
evidently
afraid
and
flying
as
we
supposed
to
his
home
accordingly
we
hastened
our
speed
and
i
being
the
nimblest
reached
him
at
a
place
where
he
was
stopped
by
a
cleft
in
the
rocks
on
the
river
woody
brink
why
do
you
fly
so
fast
from
us
said
i
we
frae
the
too
at
these
words
he
looked
wildly
round
and
his
face
was
as
ghastly
as
a
ghost
in
the
moonlight
but
distorted
as
he
was
by
his
fears
i
discovered
in
him
my
neighbour
nahum
chapelrig
and
i
spoke
to
him
by
name
o
ringan
gilhaize
said
he
and
he
took
hold
of
me
with
his
right
hand
while
he
raised
his
left
and
shook
it
in
a
fearful
and
frantic
manner
i
am
a
dead
man
my
hours
are
numbered
and
the
of
my
days
is
amaist
a
run
out
i
had
been
saved
from
the
sword
spared
from
the
spear
and
flying
from
the
field
i
went
to
a
yonder
i
sought
admission
and
shelter
for
a
forlorn
christian
man
but
the
edicts
of
the
persecutors
are
more
obeyed
here
than
the
laws
of
god
the
farmer
opened
his
casement
and
speering
if
i
had
been
at
the
raid
of
the
covenanters
which
for
the
sake
of
truth
and
the
glory
of
god
i
couldna
deny
he
shot
me
dead
on
the
spot
for
his
bullet
gaed
in
my
breast
and
is
fast
in
my
he
could
say
no
more
for
in
that
juncture
he
gave
as
it
were
a
gurgle
in
the
throat
and
swirling
round
fell
down
a
bleeding
corpse
on
the
ground
where
he
stood
before
mr
witherspoon
had
time
to
come
up
we
both
looked
at
poor
guiltless
nahum
as
he
lay
on
the
grass
and
after
some
sorrowful
communion
we
lifted
the
body
and
carrying
it
down
aneath
the
bank
of
the
river
laid
stones
and
turfs
upon
it
by
the
moonlight
that
the
unclean
birds
might
not
be
able
to
molest
his
martyred
remains
we
then
consulted
together
and
having
communed
concerning
the
manner
of
nahum
death
we
resolved
not
to
trust
ourselves
in
the
power
of
strangers
in
those
parts
of
the
country
where
the
submission
to
the
prelatic
enormity
had
been
followed
with
such
woful
evidence
of
depravity
of
heart
so
instead
of
continuing
our
journey
to
the
northward
we
changed
our
course
and
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
sought
our
way
due
west
by
the
skirts
of
the
moors
and
other
untrodden
ways
chapter
lv
at
break
of
day
we
found
ourselves
on
a
lonely
sorely
weary
hungry
and
faint
in
spirit
a
few
were
on
the
bank
and
the
birds
in
them
were
beginning
to
chirp
we
sat
down
and
wist
not
what
to
do
mr
witherspoon
prayed
inwardly
for
support
and
resignation
of
heart
in
the
trials
he
was
ordained
to
undergo
but
doure
thoughts
began
to
gather
in
my
bosom
i
yearned
for
my
family
i
mourned
to
know
what
had
become
of
my
brother
in
the
battle
and
i
grudged
and
marvelled
wherefore
it
was
that
the
royal
and
the
great
had
so
little
respect
for
the
religious
honesty
of
harmless
country
folk
it
was
now
the
day
of
november
but
the
weather
for
the
season
was
open
and
mild
and
the
morning
rose
around
us
in
the
glory
of
her
light
and
beauty
as
the
gay
and
goodly
sun
looked
over
the
eastern
hills
we
cast
our
eyes
on
all
sides
and
beheld
the
scattered
villages
and
the
rising
smoke
of
the
farms
but
saw
not
a
dwelling
we
could
venture
to
approach
nor
a
roof
that
our
fears
and
the
woful
end
of
poor
nahum
chapelrig
did
not
teach
us
to
think
covered
a
foe
while
we
were
sitting
communing
on
these
things
we
discovered
at
a
little
distance
on
the
left
an
aged
woman
hirpling
aslant
the
route
we
intended
to
take
she
had
a
porringer
in
the
one
hand
and
a
small
kit
tied
in
a
cloute
in
the
other
by
which
we
discerned
that
she
was
probably
some
laborous
man
wife
conveying
his
breakfast
to
him
in
the
field
we
both
rose
and
going
towards
her
mr
witherspoon
said
for
the
love
of
god
have
compassion
on
two
famishing
christians
the
old
woman
stopped
and
looking
round
gazed
at
us
for
a
space
of
time
with
a
countenance
of
compassionate
reverence
hech
sirs
she
then
said
and
has
it
come
to
this
that
a
minister
of
the
gospel
is
obligated
to
beg
an
almous
frae
janet
armstrong
and
she
set
down
the
porringer
on
the
ground
and
began
to
untie
the
cloute
in
which
she
carried
the
kit
saying
little
did
i
think
that
sic
an
homage
was
in
store
for
me
or
that
the
merciful
heavens
would
requite
my
sufferings
in
this
world
wi
the
honour
of
placing
it
in
my
power
to
help
a
persecuted
servant
of
the
living
god
mr
witherspoon
i
ken
you
weel
meikle
sweet
counselling
i
hae
gotten
frae
you
when
ye
preached
for
our
minister
at
camrachle
in
the
time
of
the
great
covenanting
i
was
then
as
a
lanerly
widow
for
my
gudeman

at
the
raid
of
and
my
heart
was
often
sorrowful
and
sinking
wi
a
sinful
misdooting
of
providence
for
i
had
twa
wee
bairns
and
but
a
toom
garnel
she
then
opened
the
kit
which
contained
a
providing
of
victual
that
she
was
carrying
as
we
had
thought
to
her
husband
a
quarrier
in
a
neighbouring
quarry
and
bidding
us
partake
she
said
this
will
be
a
blithe
morning
to
john
armstrong
to
think
that
out
of
our
basket
and
store
we
hae
had
for
ance
in
our
day
the
blessing
of
a
pick
to
ane

he
no
fin
his
day
dark
ae
hue
the
dreigher
for
wanting
his
breakfast
on
account
of
sic
a
cause
so
we
sat
down
and
began
to
partake
of
the
repast
with
a
greedy
appetite
and
the
worthy
woman
continued
to
talk
aye
said
she
the
has
been
in
a
consternation
ever
since
dalziel
left
glasgow
we
a
jealoused
that

said

to
meddle
with
the

are
the
peacemakers
seeing
the
honest
woman
thus
inclined
to
prattle
of
things
too
high
for
her
to
understand
mr
witherspoon
hunger
being
somewhat
abated
he
calmly
interposed
and
turned
the
discourse
into
kind
inquiries
concerning
the
state
of
her
poor
soul
and
her
straitened
worldly
circumstances
and
he
was
well
content
to
find
that
she
had
a
pleasant
vista
of
the
truths
of
salvation
and
a
confidence
in
the
unceasing
care
of
providence
the
same
gracious
hand
that
feeds
the
ravens
said
she
will
let
twa
auld
folk
want
that
it
has
been
at
the
trouble
to
provide
for
so
long
it
true
we
had
a
better
prospek
in
our
younger
days
but
our
auld
son
was
slain
at
the
battle
of
worcester
when
he
gaed
in
to
help
to
put
the
english
crown
on
the
head
of
that
false
charlie
stuart
who
has
broken
his
oath
and
the
covenant
and
my
twa
winsome
lassies
diet
in
their
teens
before
they
were
come
to
years
o
discretion
but
and
evil
are
the
days
of
man
that
is
born
of
a
woman
as
i
hae
heard
you
preach
mr
witherspoon
which
is
a
blessed
truth
and
consolation
to
those
who
have
not
in
this
world
any
continued
city
we
then
inquired
what
was
the
religious
frame
of
the
people
in
that
part
of
the
country
in
order
that
we
might
know
how
to
comport
ourselves
but
she
gave
us
little
heartening
the
strength
and
wealth
o
the
gentry
said
she
is
just
sooket
awa
wi
ae
fine
after
anither
and
it
no
in
the
power
of
nature
that
they
can
meikle
langer
stand
out
against
the
prelacy
i
hope
replied
mr
witherspoon
that
there
no
symptom
of
a
laxity
of
principle
among
them
i
doot
i
doot
mr
witherspoon
said
janet
armstrong
we
canna
hae
a
great
dependence
either
on
principle
or
doctrine
when
folk
are
driven
demented
wi
oppression
many
that
were
ance
godly
among
us
can
thole
no
more
and
they
begin
to
fash
and
turn
awa
at
the
sight
of
their
persecuted
friends
mr
witherspoon
sighed
with
a
heavy
heart
on
hearing
this
and
mournfully
shook
his
head
we
then
thanked
janet
for
her
hospitable
kindness
and
rising
were
moving
to
go
away
i
hope
mr
witherspoon
said
she
that
we
no
to
part
in
sic
a
knotless
manner
bide
here
till
i
gang
for
john
armstrong
and
the
other
twa
men
that
howk
wi
him
in
the
quarry
they
bearing
plants
o
the
vineyard
tarry
i
pray
you
and
water
them
wi
the
water
of
the
word
and
so
saying
she
hastened
down
the
track
she
was
going
and
we
continued
on
the
spot
to
wait
her
return
ringan
said
mr
witherspoon
to
me
i
fear
there
owre
meikle
truth
in
what
she
says
concerning
the
state
of
religion
not
only
here
but
among
all
the
commonality
of
the
land
the
poor
beast
that
overladen
may
be
stubborn
and
refuse
for
a
time
to
draw
but
the
whip
will
at
last
prevail
until
worn
out
and
weary
it
meekly
lies
down
to
die
in
like
manner
the
stoutness
of
the
covenanted
heart
will
be
overcome
just
as
he
was
uttering
these
words
a
whiz
in
a
near
to
where
we
were
standing
and
the
sound
of
a
gun
startled
us
and
on
looking
round
we
saw
five
men
and
one
of
the
with
his
firelock
still
at
his
shoulder
looking
towards
us
from
behind
a
dyke
that
ran
along
the
bottom
of
the
brae
there
was
no
time
for
consultation
we
fled
cowering
behind
the
till
we
got
round
a
turn
in
the
hill
which
protecting
us
from
any
immediate
shot
enabled
us
to
run
in
freedom
till
we
reached
a
which
having
entered
we
halted
to
take
breath
we
must
not
trust
ourselves
long
here
mr
witherspoon
said
i
let
us
go
forward
for
assuredly
the
will
follow
us
in
accordingly
we
went
on
but
it
is
not
to
be
told
what
we
suffered
in
passing
through
that
wood
for
the
boughs
and
branches
scourged
us
in
the
face
and
the
ground
beneath
our
feet
was
marshy
and
deep
and
grievously
overspread
with
brambles
that
tore
away
our
very
flesh
after
enduring
several
hours
of
unspeakable
suffering
beneath
those
wild
and
unfrequented
trees
we
came
to
a
little
glen
down
which
a
burn
ran
and
having
stopped
to
consult
we
resolved
to
go
up
rather
than
down
the
stream
in
order
that
we
might
not
be
seen
by
the
pursuers
whom
we
supposed
would
naturally
keep
the
hill
but
by
this
time
our
strength
was
in
a
manner
utterly
gone
with
fatigue
in
so
much
that
mr
witherspoon
said
it
would
be
as
well
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
as
to
die
in
the
wood
i
however
encouraged
him
to
be
of
good
cheer
and
it
so
happened
in
that
very
moment
of
despair
that
i
observed
a
little
cavern
nook
aneath
a
rock
that
overhung
the
burn
and
thither
i
proposed
we
should
wade
and
rest
ourselves
in
the
cave
trusting
that
providence
would
be
pleased
to
guide
our
persecutors
into
some
other
path
so
we
passed
the
water
and
laid
ourselves
down
under
the
shelter
of
the
rock
where
we
soon
after
fell
asleep
chapter
lvi
we
were
graciously
protected
for
the
space
of
four
hours
which
we
lay
asleep
under
the
rock
mr
witherspoon
was
the
first
who
awoke
and
he
sat
watching
beside
me
for
some
time
in
great
anxiety
of
spirit
as
he
afterwards
told
me
for
the
day
was
far
spent
and
the
weather
as
is
often
the
custom
in
our
climate
in
the
wane
of
the
year
when
the
morning
rises
bright
had
become
coarse
and
drumly
threatening
a
rough
night
at
last
i
awoke
and
according
to
what
we
had
previously
counselled
together
we
went
up
the
course
of
the
burn
and
so
got
out
of
that
afflicting
wood
and
came
to
an
open
and
wide
moorland
over
which
we
held
our
journeying
westward
guided
by
the
sun
that
with
a
sickly
eye
was
then
cowering
through
the
mist
to
his
chamber
ayont
the
hill
but
though
all
around
us
was
a
pathless
scene
of
brown
heather
here
and
there
patched
with
the
deceitful
green
of
some
perilous
though
the
skies
were
sullen
and
the
bleak
wind
gusty
and
every
now
and
then
a
straggling
flake
of
snow
strewed
in
our
way
from
the
invisible
hand
of
the
cloud
was
a
token
of
a
coming
drift
still
a
joyous
encouragement
was
shed
into
our
bosoms
and
we
saw
in
the
wildness
of
the
waste
and
the
omens
of
the
storm
the
blessed
means
with
which
providence
in
that
forlorn
epoch
was
manifestly
deterring
the
pursuer
and
the
persecutor
from
tracking
our
defenceless
flight
so
we
journeyed
onward
discoursing
of
many
dear
and
tender
cares
often
looking
round
and
listening
when
startled
by
the
wind
whispering
to
the
heath
and
the
waving
fern
till
the
shadows
of
evening
began
to
fall
and
the
dangers
of
the
night
season
to
darken
around
us
when
the
snow
hung
on
the
heather
like
its
own
bells
we
wished
but
we
feared
to
seek
a
place
of
shelter
fain
would
we
have
gone
back
to
the
home
for
the
fugitive
which
we
had
found
under
the
rock
but
we
knew
not
how
to
turn
ourselves
for
the
lights
of
the
moon
and
stars
were
deeply
concealed
in
the
dark
folds
of
the
wintry
mantle
with
which
the
heavens
were
wrapt
up
our
hearts
then
grew
weary
and
more
than
once
i
felt
as
if
i
was
very
willing
to
die
still
we
struggled
on
and
when
it
had
been
dark
about
an
hour
we
came
to
the
skirts
of
a
field
where
the
strips
of
the
stubble
through
the
snow
showed
us
that
some
house
or
clachan
could
not
be
far
off
we
then
consulted
together
and
resolved
rather
to
make
our
place
of
rest
in
the
lea
of
a
stack
or
an
outhouse
than
to
apply
to
the
dwelling
for
the
thought
of
the
untimely
end
of
harmless
nahum
chapelrig
lay
like
clay
on
our
hearts
and
we
could
not
but
sorrow
that
among
the
other
woes
of
the
vial
of
the
prelatic
dispensation
the
hearts
of
the
people
of
scotland
should
be
so
turned
against
one
another
accordingly
going
down
the
rigs
with
as
little
interchange
of
discourse
as
could
well
be
we
descried
by
the
schimmer
of
the
snow
and
a
ghastly
streak
of
moonlight
that
passed
over
the
fields
a
farm
steading
with
several
trees
and
stacks
around
it
and
thither
we
softly
directed
our
steps
greatly
however
were
we
surprised
and
touched
with
distress
when
as
we
drew
near
we
saw
that
there
was
no
light
in
the
house
nor
the
sign
of
fire
within
nor
inhabitant
about
the
place
on
reaching
the
door
we
found
it
open
and
on
entering
in
everything
seemed
as
if
it
had
been
suddenly
abandoned
but
by
the
help
of
a
pistol
which
i
had
taken
in
the
raid
from
one
of
turner
disarmed
troopers
and
putting
our
trust
in
the
protection
we
had
so
far
enjoyed
i
struck
a
light
and
kindled
the
fire
over
which
there
was
still
hanging
on
the
swee
a
wherein
the
family
at
the
time
of
their
flight
had
been
preparing
their
dinner
and
we
judged
by
this
token
and
by
the
visible
desertion
that
we
were
in
the
house
of
some
of
god
people
who
had
been
suddenly
scattered
accordingly
we
scrupled
not
to
help
ourselves
from
the
aumrie
knowing
how
readily
they
would
pardon
the
freedom
of
need
in
a
gospel
minister
and
a
covenanted
brother
dejected
with
want
and
much
suffering
having
finished
our
supper
instead
of
sitting
by
the
fire
as
we
at
first
proposed
to
do
we
thought
it
would
be
safer
to
take
the
blankets
from
the
beds
and
make
our
lair
in
the
barn
so
we
accordingly
retired
thither
and
lay
down
among
some
unthreshed
corn
that
was
lying
ready
on
the
floor
for
the
flail
but
we
were
not
well
down
when
we
heard
the
breathings
of
two
persons
near
us
as
there
was
no
light
and
mr
witherspoon
guessing
by
what
we
had
seen
and
by
this
concealment
that
they
must
be
some
of
the
family
he
began
to
pray
aloud
thereby
without
letting
wot
they
were
discovered
making
them
to
understand
what
sort
of
guests
we
were
at
the
conclusion
an
old
woman
spoke
to
us
telling
us
dreadful
things
which
a
gang
of
soldiers
had
committed
that
afternoon
and
her
sad
story
was
often
interrupted
by
the
moans
of
her
daughter
the
farmer
wife
who
had
suffered
from
the
soldiers
an
unspeakable
wrong
but
what
has
become
of
our
men
or
where
the
bairns
hae
fled
we
know
not
we
were
baith
demented
by
the
outrage
and
hid
oursel
here
after
it
was
owre
late
said
that
aged
person
in
a
voice
of
settled
grief
that
was
more
sorrowful
to
hear
than
any
lamentation
could
have
been
and
all
the
sacred
exhortations
that
mr
witherspoon
could
employ
softened
not
the
obduracy
of
her
inward
sorrowing
over
her
daughter
the
dishonoured
wife
he
however
persuaded
them
to
return
with
us
to
the
house
for
the
enemy
having
been
there
we
thought
it
not
likely
he
would
that
night
come
again
as
for
me
during
the
dismal
recital
i
could
not
speak
the
eye
of
my
spirit
was
fixed
on
the
treasure
i
had
left
at
home
every
word
i
heard
was
like
the
sting
of
an
adder
my
horrors
and
fears
rose
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
could
no
longer
master
them
i
started
up
and
rushed
to
the
door
as
if
it
had
been
possible
to
arrest
the
imagined
guilt
of
the
persecutors
in
my
own
unprotected
dwelling
mr
witherspoon
followed
me
thinking
i
had
gone
by
myself
and
caught
me
by
the
arm
and
entreated
me
to
be
composed
and
to
return
with
him
into
the
house
but
while
he
was
thus
kindly
remonstrating
with
me
something
took
his
foot
and
he
stumbled
and
fell
to
the
ground
the
accident
served
to
check
the
frenzy
of
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
and
i
stooped
down
to
help
him
up
but
in
the
same
instant
he
uttered
a
wild
howl
that
made
me
start
from
him
and
he
then
added
awfully
in
the
name
of
heaven
what
is
this
what
is
it
said
i
filled
with
unutterable
dread
hush
hush
he
replied
as
he
rose
lest
the
poor
women
hear
us
and
he
lifted
in
his
arms
the
body
of
a
child
of
some
four
or
five
years
old
i
could
endure
no
more
i
thought
the
voices
of
my
own
innocents
cried
to
me
for
help
and
in
the
frenzy
of
the
moment
i
left
the
godly
man
and
fled
like
a
demoniac
not
knowing
which
way
i
went
chapter
lvii
a
keen
frost
had
succeeded
the
snow
and
the
wind
blew
piercingly
cold
but
the
gloom
had
passed
away
the
starry
eyes
of
the
heavens
were
all
wakefully
bright
and
the
moon
was
moving
along
the
fleecy
edge
of
a
cloud
like
a
lonely
barque
that
navigates
amidst
the
foaming
perils
of
some
dark
inhospitable
shore
at
the
time
however
i
was
in
no
frame
of
thought
to
note
these
things
but
i
know
that
such
was
then
the
aspect
of
that
night
for
as
often
yet
as
the
freezing
wind
sweeps
over
the
fields
strewed
with
snow
and
the
stars
are
shining
vigilantly
and
the
moon
hastily
travels
on
the
skirts
of
the
cloud
the
passion
of
that
hour
at
the
sight
thereof
revives
in
my
spirit
and
the
mourning
women
and
the
perished
child
in
the
arms
of
mr
witherspoon
appear
like
palpable
imagery
before
the
eyes
of
my
remembrance
the
speed
with
which
i
ran
soon
exhausted
my
i
began
to
reflect
on
the
unavailing
zeal
with
which
i
was
then
hastening
to
the
succour
of
those
for
whom
my
soul
was
suffering
more
than
the
tongue
of
the
eloquent
orator
can
i
stopped
to
collect
my
reason
and
my
thoughts
which
i
may
well
say
were
scattered
like
the
wrack
that
drifts
in
the
tempestuous
i
considered
that
i
knew
not
a
footstep
of
the
road
that
dangers
surrounded
me
on
all
sides
and
that
the
precipitation
of
my
haste
might
draw
me
into
accidents
whereby
the
very
object
would
be
lost
which
i
was
so
eager
to
gain
and
the
storm
within
me
abated
and
the
distraction
of
my
bosom
which
had
so
well
nigh
shipwrekt
my
understanding
was
moderated
like
the
billows
of
the
ocean
when
the
blasts
are
gone
by
so
that
after
i
was
some
four
or
five
miles
away
from
yon
house
of
martyrdom
and
mourning
a
gracious
dispensation
of
composure
was
poured
into
my
spirit
and
i
was
thereby
enabled
to
go
forward
in
my
journey
with
the
circumspection
so
needful
in
that
woful
time
but
in
proportion
as
my
haste
slackened
and
the
fiery
violence
of
the
fears
subsided
wherewith
i
was
hurried
on
the
icy
tooth
of
the
winter
grew
feller
in
the
bite
and
i
became
in
a
manner
almost
helpless
the
mind
within
me
was
as
if
the
faculty
of
its
thinking
had
been
frozen
up
and
about
the
dawn
of
morning
i
walked
in
a
willess
manner
the
blood
in
my
veins
not
more
benumbed
in
its
course
than
was
the
fluency
of
my
spirit
in
its
power
of
resolution
i
had
now
from
the
time
that
our
covenanted
host
was
scattered
on
travelled
many
miles
and
though
like
a
barque
drifting
rudderless
on
the
ocean
tides
as
the
stream
flows
and
the
blast
blows
i
had
held
no
constant
course
still
my
progress
had
been
havenward
in
so
much
that
about
sunrise
i
found
myself
i
can
not
well
tell
how
on
the
heights
to
the
south
of
castlemilk
and
the
city
of
glasgow
with
her
goodly
array
of
many
towers
glittering
in
the
morning
beams
lay
in
sight
some
few
miles
off
on
the
north
i
knew
it
not
but
a
herd
that
i
fell
in
with
on
the
hill
told
me
what
town
it
was
and
the
names
of
divers
clachans
and
the
houses
of
men
of
substance
in
the
lowlands
before
me
among
others
he
pointed
out
to
me
nether
pollock
in
the
midst
of
a
skirting
of
trees
the
seat
and
castle
of
that
godly
and
christian
and
true
covenanter
sir
george
maxwell
the
savour
of
whose
piety
was
spread
far
and
wide
for
he
had
suffered
much
both
from
sore
imprisonment
and
the
heavy
fine
of
four
thousand
pounds
imposed
upon
him
shortly
after
that
conclave
of
satan
middleton
sederunt
of
the
at
glasgow
where
prelatic
cruelty
was
brought
to
bed
of
her
in
that
edict
against
the
ministers
at
the
beginning
of
the
persecution
whereof
i
have
described
the
promulgation
as
it
took
place
at
irvine
being
then
hungered
and
very
cold
after
discoursing
with
the
poor
herd
who
was
a
simple
stripling
in
the
ignorance
of
innocence
i
resolved
to
bend
my
way
toward
nether
pollock
in
the
confident
faith
that
the
master
thereof
having
suffered
so
much
himself
would
know
how
to
compassionate
a
persecuted
brother
and
often
since
i
have
thought
that
there
was
something
higher
than
reason
in
the
instinct
of
this
confidence
for
indeed
had
i
reasoned
from
what
was
commonly
said
and
alas
owre
truly
that
the
covenanted
spirit
was
bent
if
not
broken
i
would
have
feared
to
seek
the
gates
of
sir
george
maxwell
lest
the
love
he
had
once
borne
to
our
cause
had
been
converted
by
his
own
sufferings
and
apprehensions
into
dread
or
aversion
but
i
was
encouraged
of
the
spirit
to
proceed
just
however
as
i
parted
from
the
herd
he
cried
after
me
and
pointed
to
a
man
coming
up
the
hill
at
some
distance
with
a
gun
in
his
hand
and
a
at
his
side
and
two
dogs
at
his
heel
saying
sir
george
maxwell
himsel
ganging
to
the
moors
eh
but
he
has
had
his
ain
luck
to
fill
his
pock
so
weel
already
whereupon
i
turned
my
steps
towards
sir
george
and
on
approaching
him
beseeched
him
to
have
compassion
on
a
poor
famished
fugitive
from
the
pentlands
he
stopped
and
looked
at
me
in
a
most
pitiful
manner
and
shook
his
head
and
said
with
a
tender
grief
in
his
voice
it
was
a
hasty
business
and
the
worst
of
it
no
yet
either
heard
nor
over
but
let
us
lose
no
time
for
you
are
in
much
danger
if
you
tarry
so
near
to
glasgow
where
colonel
drummond
came
yesterday
with
a
detachment
of
soldiers
and
has
already
spread
them
over
the
country
in
saying
these
words
the
worthy
gentleman
opened
his
bag
which
instead
of
being
filled
with
game
as
the
marvelling
stripling
had
supposed
contained
a
store
of
provisions
i
came
not
for
pastime
to
the
moor
this
morning
said
he
presenting
to
me
something
to
eat
but
because
last
night
i
heard
that
many
of
the
outcasts
had
been
seen
yesterday
lurking
about
thae
hills
and
as
i
could
not
give
them
harbour
nor
even
let
them
have
any
among
my
tenants
i
have
come
out
with
some
of
my
men
as
it
were
to
the
shooting
in
order
to
succour
them
but
we
must
not
remain
long
together
take
with
you
what
you
may
require
and
go
away
quickly
and
i
counsel
you
not
to
take
the
road
to
paisley
but
to
cross
with
what
speed
you
can
to
the
western
parts
of
the
shire
where
as
the
people
have
not
been
concerned
in
the
raid
there
the
less
likelihood
of
drummond
sending
any
of
his
force
in
that
direction
accordingly
being
thus
plentifully
supplied
by
the
providence
of
that
worthy
my
strength
was
wonderfully
recruited
and
my
heart
cheered
with
many
thanks
i
then
hastened
from
him
praying
that
his
private
charitable
intents
might
bring
him
into
no
trouble
and
surely
it
was
a
thing
hallowing
to
the
affections
of
the
afflicted
scottish
nation
to
meet
with
such
christian
fellowship
for
to
the
perpetual
renown
of
many
honourable
west
country
families
be
it
spoken
both
master
and
men
were
daily
in
the
moors
at
that
time
succouring
the
persecuted
like
the
ravens
that
fed
elijah
in
the
wilderness
after
parting
from
sir
george
maxwell
i
continued
to
bend
my
course
straight
westward
and
having
crossed
the
road
from
glasgow
to
paisley
i
directed
my
steps
to
the
hillier
parts
of
the
country
being
minded
according
to
the
suggestions
of
that
excellent
person
to
find
my
way
by
the
into
the
shire
of
ayr
but
though
my
anxiety
concerning
my
family
was
now
sharpened
as
it
were
with
the
anguish
of
fire
i
began
to
reason
with
myself
on
the
jeopardy
i
might
bring
upon
them
were
i
to
return
while
the
pursuit
was
so
fierce
and
in
the
end
i
came
to
the
determination
only
to
seek
to
know
how
it
fared
with
them
and
what
had
become
of
my
brother
in
the
battle
trusting
that
in
due
season
the
lord
would
mitigate
the
ire
and
the
cruelty
that
was
let
loose
on
all
those
who
had
joined
in
the
protestation
and
renewed
the
covenant
at
lanerk
chapter
lviii
towards
the
afternoon
i
found
myself
among
the
solitudes
of
the
renfrewshire
moors
save
at
times
the
melancholious
note
of
the
neither
the
sound
nor
the
voice
of
any
living
thing
was
heard
there
being
then
wearied
in
all
my
limbs
and
willingly
disposed
to
sleep
i
laid
myself
down
on
a
green
hollow
on
the
banks
of
the
gryffe
where
the
sun
shone
with
a
pleasing
warmth
for
so
late
a
period
of
the
year
i
was
not
however
many
minutes
stretched
on
the
grass
when
i
heard
a
shrill
whistle
of
some
one
nigh
at
hand
and
presently
also
the
barking
of
a
dog
from
the
kindly
experience
i
had
received
of
sir
george
maxwell
care
this
occasioned
at
first
no
alarm
but
on
looking
up
i
beheld
at
some
distance
three
soldiers
with
a
dog
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
near
the
spot
where
i
lay
there
was
a
cloven
rock
overspread
with
brambles
and
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
the
cleft
had
been
prepared
on
purpose
by
providence
for
a
i
crept
into
it
and
forgetting
him
by
whom
i
was
protected
i
trembled
with
a
base
fear
but
in
that
very
moment
he
at
once
rebuked
my
infirmity
and
gave
me
a
singular
assurance
of
his
holy
wardenship
by
causing
an
adder
to
come
towards
me
from
the
roots
of
the
bushes
as
if
to
force
me
to
flee
into
the
view
of
the
pursuers
just
however
as
in
my
horror
i
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
the
reptile
looked
at
me
with
its
glittering
eyes
and
then
suddenly
leapt
away
into
the
brake
at
the
same
moment
a
hare
was
raised
by
the
dog
and
the
soldiers
following
it
with
shouts
and
halloes
were
soon
carried
by
the
impetuosity
of
the
natural
incitement
which
man
has
for
the
chase
far
from
the
spot
and
out
of
sight
this
adventure
had
for
a
time
the
effect
of
rousing
me
from
out
the
weariness
with
which
i
had
been
oppressed
and
i
rose
and
continued
my
course
westward
over
the
hills
till
i
came
in
sight
of
the
the
stream
of
which
i
followed
for
more
than
a
mile
with
a
beating
heart
for
the
valley
through
which
it
flows
is
bare
and
open
and
had
any
of
the
persecutors
been
then
on
the
neighbouring
hills
i
must
have
soon
been
seen
but
gradually
my
thoughts
became
more
composed
and
the
terrors
of
the
poor
hunted
creature
again
became
changed
into
confidence
and
hope
in
this
renewed
spirit
i
slackened
my
pace
and
seeing
at
a
short
distance
down
the
stream
before
me
a
tree
laid
across
a
bridge
i
was
comforted
with
the
persuasion
that
some
could
not
be
far
off
so
i
resolved
to
linger
about
till
the
gloaming
and
then
to
follow
the
path
which
led
over
the
bridge
for
not
knowing
how
the
inhabitants
in
those
parts
stood
inclined
in
their
consciences
i
was
doubtful
to
trust
myself
in
their
power
until
i
had
made
some
espionage
accordingly
as
the
sun
was
still
above
the
hills
i
kept
the
hollowest
track
by
the
river
brink
and
went
down
its
course
for
some
little
time
till
i
arrived
where
the
hills
come
forward
into
the
valley
then
i
climbed
up
a
steep
hazel
bank
and
sat
down
to
rest
myself
on
an
open
green
plot
on
the
brow
where
a
gentle
west
wind
shook
the
boughs
around
me
as
if
the
silent
spirits
of
the
solitude
were
slowly
passing
by
in
this
place
i
had
not
been
long
when
i
heard
as
if
it
were
not
far
off
a
sullen
roar
of
falling
waters
rising
hoarsely
with
the
breeze
and
listening
again
another
sound
came
solemnly
mingled
with
it
which
i
had
soon
the
delight
to
discover
was
the
holy
harmony
of
worship
and
to
my
ears
it
was
as
the
first
sound
of
the
rushing
water
which
moses
brought
from
the
rock
to
those
of
the
thirsty
israelites
and
i
was
for
some
time
so
ravished
with
joy
that
i
could
not
move
from
the
spot
where
i
was
sitting
at
last
the
sweet
melody
of
the
psalm
died
away
and
i
arose
and
went
towards
the
airt
from
which
it
had
come
but
as
i
advanced
the
noise
of
the
roaring
waters
grew
louder
and
deeper
till
they
were
as
the
breaking
of
the
summer
waves
along
the
ardrossan
shore
and
presently
i
found
myself
on
the
brink
of
a
cliff
over
which
the
river
tumbled
into
a
rugged
chasm
where
the
rocks
were
skirted
with
leafless
brambles
and
hazel
and
garmented
with
ivy
on
a
green
sloping
bank
at
a
short
distance
below
the
waterfall
screened
by
the
rocks
and
trees
on
the
one
side
and
by
the
rising
ground
on
the
other
about
thirty
of
the
lord
flock
old
and
young
were
seated
around
the
feet
of
an
aged
man
who
was
preaching
to
them
his
left
hand
resting
on
his
staff
his
right
was
raised
in
exhortation
and
a
bible
lay
on
the
ground
beside
him
i
stood
for
the
space
of
a
minute
looking
at
the
mournful
yet
edifying
sight
mournful
it
was
to
think
how
god
people
were
so
afflicted
that
they
durst
not
do
their
heavenly
king
homage
but
in
secrecy
and
edifying
that
their
constancy
was
of
such
an
enduring
nature
that
persecution
served
but
to
test
it
as
fire
does
the
purity
of
gold
as
i
was
so
standing
on
the
rock
above
the
linn
the
preacher
happened
to
lift
his
eyes
towards
me
and
the
hearers
who
were
looking
at
him
turned
round
and
hastily
rising
began
to
scatter
and
flee
away
i
attempted
to
cry
to
them
not
to
be
afraid
but
the
sound
of
the
cataract
drowned
my
voice
i
then
ran
as
swiftly
as
i
could
towards
the
spot
of
worship
and
reached
the
top
of
the
sloping
bank
just
as
a
young
man
was
assisting
mr
swinton
to
mount
a
horse
which
stood
ready
saddled
tied
to
a
tree
for
the
preacher
was
no
other
than
that
godly
man
but
the
courteous
reader
must
from
his
own
kind
heart
supply
what
passed
at
our
meeting
fain
he
was
at
that
time
to
have
gone
no
farther
on
with
the
exercise
and
to
have
asked
many
questions
of
me
concerning
the
expedition
to
the
pentlands
but
i
importuned
him
to
continue
his
blessed
work
for
i
longed
to
taste
the
sweet
waters
of
life
once
more
from
so
hallowed
a
fountain
and
moreover
there
was
a
woman
with
a
baby
at
her
bosom
which
she
had
brought
to
be
baptized
from
a
neighbouring
farm
called
the
killochenn
and
a
young
couple
of
a
composed
and
sober
aspect
from
the
waiting
to
be
joined
together
with
his
blessing
in
marriage
when
he
had
closed
his
sermon
and
done
these
things
i
went
with
him
walking
at
the
side
of
his
horse
discoursing
of
our
many
grievous
anxieties
and
he
told
me
that
after
being
taken
to
glasgow
and
confined
in
prison
there
like
a
malefactor
for
thirteen
days
he
had
been
examined
by
the
bishop
court
and
through
the
mediation
of
one
of
the
magistrates
a
friend
of
his
own
who
had
a
soft
word
to
say
with
the
bishop
he
was
set
free
with
only
a
menace
and
an
admonishment
not
to
go
within
twenty
miles
of
his
own
parish
under
pain
of
being
dealt
with
according
to
the
edict
conversing
in
this
manner
and
followed
by
divers
of
those
who
had
been
solaced
with
his
preaching
for
the
most
part
pious
folk
belonging
to
the
town
of
inverkip
we
came
to
a
bridge
over
the
river
here
ringan
said
he
we
must
part
for
the
present
for
it
is
not
meet
to
create
suspicion
there
are
many
of
the
faithful
no
doubt
in
thir
parts
but
it
no
to
be
denied
that
there
are
likewise
goats
among
the
sheep
the
lady
of
dunrod
where
i
am
now
going
is
without
question
a
precious
vessel
free
of
crack
or
flaw
but
the
laird
is
of
a
courtly
compliancy
and
their
neighbour
carswell
she
tells
me
is
a
man
of
the
dourest
idolatry
his
mother
having
been
a
papistical
woman
and
his
father
through
all
the
time
of
the
first
king
charles
an
eydent
ettler
for
preferment
so
we
then
parted
he
going
his
way
to
dunrod
castle
and
one
of
the
hearers
a
farmer
hard
by
offering
me
shelter
for
the
night
i
went
with
him
chapter
lix
the
decent
thoughtful
elderly
man
who
so
kindly
invited
me
to
his
house
was
by
name
called
gideon
kemp
and
as
we
were
going
towards
it
together
he
told
me
of
divers
things
that
worthy
mr
swinton
had
not
time
to
do
among
the
rest
that
the
preaching
i
had
fallen
in
with
at
the
linn
which
should
thenceforth
be
called
the
covenanters
linn
was
the
first
taste
of
that
the
scattered
sheep
of
those
parts
had
tasted
for
more
than
eight
months
what
to
come
out
o
a
this
oppression
said
he
is
wonderful
to
think
o
it
no
in
the
power
of
nature
that
ony
government
or
earthly
institution
framed
by
the
wit
and
will
of
man
can
withstand
a
whole
people
the
prelates
may
persecute
and
the
king
power
may
back
their
iniquities
but
the
day
and
the
hour
can
not
be
far
off
when
both
the
power
and
the
persecutors
will
be
set
at
nought
and
the
sense
of
what
is
needful
and
right
no
what
is
fantastical
and
arbitrary
govern
again
in
the
counsels
of
this
realm
i
say
not
this
in
the
boast
of
prediction
and
prophecy
but
as
a
thing
that
must
come
to
pass
for
no
man
can
say
that
the
peaceful
worshipping
according
to
the
word
is
either
a
sin
a
shame
or
an
offence
against
reason
but
the
extortioning
of
fines
and
the
desolation
of
families
for
attending
the
same
is
manifestly
guilt
of
a
dark
dye
and
the
judge
of
righteousness
will
avenge
it
as
we
were
thus
walking
sedately
towards
his
dwelling
i
observed
and
pointed
out
to
him
a
lassie
coming
running
towards
us
it
was
his
daughter
and
when
she
came
near
panting
and
out
of
breath
with
her
haste
she
said
o
father
ye
manna
gang
hame
twa
of
carswell
men
hae
been
speering
for
you
and
they
had
swords
and
guns
they
the
hill
to
the
linn
for
wee
willie
telt
them
ye
were
gane
there
to
a
preaching
this
comes
says
the
afflicted
gideon
of
speaking
of
secret
things
before
bairns
wha
could
hae
thought
that
a
creature
no
four
years
old
would
have
been
an
instrument
of
discovery
it
no
be
safe
now
for
you
to
come
hame
wi
me
which
i
wae
for
as
ye
sae
sorely
but
there
a
frien
o
ours
that
lives
ayont
the
aboon
the
auld
kirk
i
convey
you
thither
and
she
you
a
shelter
for
the
night
so
we
turned
back
and
again
crossed
the
bridge
before
spoken
of
and
held
our
course
towards
the
house
of
gideon
kemp
wife
stepmother
but
it
was
not
ordained
that
i
was
yet
to
enjoy
the
protection
of
a
raftered
dwelling
for
just
as
we
came
to
the
down
the
glen
of
which
my
godly
guide
was
mindet
to
conduct
me
as
being
a
less
observable
way
than
the
open
road
he
saw
one
of
ardgowan
men
coming
towards
us
and
that
family
being
of
the
progeny
of
the
stuarts
were
inclined
to
the
prelatic
side
hide
yoursel
said
he
among
the
bushes
and
i
de
myself
in
a
nook
of
the
glen
where
i
overheard
what
passed
i
thought
gideon
said
the
lad
to
him
that
ye
would
hae
been
at
the
conventicle
this
afternoon
we
hae
heard
a
and
carswell
has
sworn
that
he
hae
baith
doited
swinton
and
dunrod
leddy
at
glasgow
afore
the
morn
or
he
mak
a
tawnle
o
her
tower
carswell
shouldna
crack
sae
croose
replied
gideon
kemp
for
though
his
castle
stands
proud
in
the
green
valley
the
time
may
yet
come
when
horses
and
carts
will
be
driven
through
his
ha
and
the
foul
toad
and
the
cauld
snail
be
the
only
visitors
around
the
unblest
hearth
carswell
the
way
in
which
that
gifted
man
said
these
words
made
my
heart
dinle
but
i
hae
lived
to
hear
that
the
spirit
of
prophecy
was
assuredly
in
them
for
since
the
revolution
carswell
family
has
gone
all
to
drift
and
his
house
become
a
wastege
folk
say
a
new
road
talked
o
between
inverkip
and
greenock
is
to
go
through
the
very
middle
and
so
mak
it
an
awful
monument
of
what
awaits
and
will
betide
all
those
who
have
no
mercy
on
their
and
would
exalt
themselves
by
abetting
the
strength
of
the
godless
and
the
wrength
of
the
oppressors
ardgowan
man
was
daunted
by
the
words
of
gideon
kemp
and
replied
in
a
subdued
manner
it
really
a
melancholious
thing
to
think
that
folk
should
hae
gane
so
wud
about
ministers
and
religion
but
tak
care
of
yoursel
gideon
for
a
party
of
soldiers
hae
come
the
day
to
cartsdyke
to
take
up
ony
of
the
rebels
that
hae
fled
to
thir
parts
and
they
catcht
i
hear
in
a
public
in
the
stenners
three
men
and
have
sent
them
to
glasgow
to
be
hanged
i
verily
thought
my
heart
would
at
this
have
leapt
out
of
my
bosom
surely
replied
gideon
kemp
the
wrath
of
government
is
no
so
unquenchable
that
a
the
misguided
folk
concernt
in
the
rising
are
to
die
but
hae
ye
heard
the
names
of
the
prisoners
or
where
they
belong
to
they
o
the
shire
o
ayr
somewhere
frae
the
skirts
o
irvine
or
kilwinning
and
i
was
likewise
told
their
names
but
they
no
of
a
familiarity
easy
to
be
remembered
the
horror
which
fell
upon
me
at
hearing
this
made
me
forget
my
own
peril
and
i
sprung
out
of
the
place
of
my
concealment
and
cried
do
you
ken
if
any
of
them
was
of
the
name
of
gilhaize
ardgowan
man
was
astounded
at
seeing
me
standing
before
him
in
so
instanter
a
manner
and
before
making
any
response
he
looked
at
gideon
kemp
with
a
jealous
and
troubled
eye
nay
said
i
you
shall
deal
honestly
with
me
and
from
this
spot
you
shall
not
depart
till
you
have
promised
to
use
nae
scaith
to
this
worthy
man
so
i
took
hold
of
him
by
the
skirts
of
his
coat
and
added
in
the
hands
of
one
that
tribulation
has
made
desperate
i
too
am
a
rebel
as
ye
say
from
and
my
life
is
forfeited
to
the
ravenous
desires
of
those
who
made
the
laws
that
have
created
our
offence
but
fear
no
wrong
if
you
have
aught
of
christian
compassion
in
you
was
gilhaize
the
name
of
any
of
the
prisoners
i
no
was
his
answer
but
i
think
it
was
something
like
that
one
of
them
i
think
they
called
finnie
robin
finnie
cried
i
dropping
his
coat
he
was
wi
my
brother
i
canna
doubt
it
and
the
thought
of
their
fate
flooded
my
heart
and
the
tears
flowed
from
my
eyes
the
better
nature
of
ardgowan
man
was
moved
at
the
sight
of
my
distress
and
he
said
to
gideon
kemp
ye
needna
be
gideon
i
hope
ye
ken
mair
o
me
than
to
think
i
would
betray
either
friend
or
acquaintance
but
gang
na
to
the
toun
for
a
in
a
state
o
unco
wi
the
news
o
what
being
doing
the
day
at
cartsdyke
and
every
body
in
the
hourly
dread
and
fear
some
o
the
coming
to
devour
them
that
spoken
like
yoursel
johnnie
jamieson
said
gideon
kemp
but
this
poor
man
meaning
me
has
had
a
day
o
weary
travel
among
the
moors
and
is
greatly
in
need
of
refreshment
and
a
place
of
rest
when
the
sword
johnnie
is
in
the
hand
it
an
honourable
thing
to
deal
stoutly
wi
the
foe
but
when
forlorn
and
dejectit
and
more
houseless
than
the
beasts
of
the
field
he
no
longer
an
adversary
but
a
man
that
we
bound
by
the
laws
of
god
and
nature
to
help
jamieson
remained
for
a
short
space
in
a
dubious
manner
and
looking
mildly
towards
me
he
said
gang
you
your
ways
gideon
kemp
and
say
i
saw
you
and
let
your
friend
den
himsel
in
the
glen
and
trust
me
naebody
in
a
inverkip
will
jealouse
that
ony
of
our
house
would
help
or
harbour
a
covenanted
rebel
so
i
can
bring
him
to
some
place
o
succour
in
the
gloaming
where
he
be
safer
than
he
could
you
troubled
and
sorrowful
as
i
was
i
could
not
but
observe
the
look
of
scrutiny
that
gideon
kemp
cast
at
jamieson
who
himself
was
sensible
of
his
mistrust
for
he
replied
dinna
misdoot
me
gideon
kemp
i
would
sooner
put
my
right
hand
in
the
fire
and
burn
it
to
a
cinder
than
harm
the
hair
of
a
man
that
was
in
my
power
and
i
believe
you
said
i
so
guide
me
wheresoever
you
will
ye
never
thrive
johnnie
jamieson
added
honest
gideon
if
no
sincere
in
this
trust
so
after
some
little
farther
communing
the
worthy
farmer
left
us
and
i
followed
jamieson
down
the
till
we
came
to
a
mill
that
stood
in
the
hollow
of
the
glen
the
wheel
whereof
was
happing
in
the
water
with
a
pleasant
and
peaceful
din
that
sounded
consolatory
to
my
hearing
after
the
solitudes
the
storms
and
the
accidents
i
had
met
with
bide
you
here
said
jamieson
the
gudeman
ane
o
your
folk
but
his
wife
a
thought
camstrarie
at
times
and
before
i
tak
you
into
the
mill
i
maun
look
that
she
no
there
so
he
hastened
forward
and
going
to
the
door
went
in
leaving
me
standing
at
the
sluice
of
the
where
however
i
had
not
occasion
to
wait
long
for
presently
he
came
out
and
beckoned
to
me
with
his
hand
to
come
quickly
chapter
lx
sauners
paton
as
the
miller
was
called
received
me
in
a
kindly
manner
saying
to
jamieson
i
aye
thought
johnnie
that
some
day
ye
would
get
a
cast
o
grace
and
the
lord
has
been
bountiful
to
you
at
last
in
putting
it
in
your
power
to
be
aiding
in
such
a
samaritan
work
but
he
added
turning
to
me
it
no
just
in
my
power
to
do
for
you
what
i
could
wis
for
to
keep
peace
in
the
house
i
at
times
like
many
other
married
men
obligated
to
let
the
gudewife
tak
her
ain
way
for
which
reason
i
doubt
ye
hae
to
mak
your
bed
here
in
the
mill
while
he
was
thus
speaking
we
heard
the
tongue
of
mrs
paton
ringing
like
a
bell
for
heaven
sake
johnnie
jamieson
cried
the
miller
gang
out
and
stop
her
frae
coming
hither
till
i
get
the
poor
man
hidden
in
the
loft
jamieson
ran
out
leaving
us
together
and
the
miller
placing
a
ladder
i
mounted
up
into
the
loft
where
he
spread
sacks
for
a
bed
to
me
and
told
me
to
lie
quiet
and
in
the
dusk
he
would
bring
me
something
to
eat
but
before
he
had
well
descended
and
removed
the
ladder
from
the
in

the
mistress

of
so
propugnacious
a
temper
that
the
poor
man
saw
no
better
than
to
yield
obedience
so
far
as
to
pull
the
string
that
turned
off
the
water
of

ye

an
unco
reasonable

but
leddy
stuart
quadrooped
bird
they
a
parrot
can
come
and
again
ony
word
as
weel
as
you
can
do
reason
but
reason
here
or
reason
there
i
consent
to
let
you
stay
to
be
put
to
the
sword
before
my
so
come
out
o
the
mill
and
lock
the
door
to
this
the
honest
man
made
no
immediate
answer
but
after
a
short
silence
he
said
kate
my
queen
i
no
say
that
what
ye
say
is
far
wrang
it
may
be
as
weel
for
me
to
tak
a
dauner
to
the
top
o
dunrod
but
some
providing
should
be
made
for
a
sojourn
a
night
in
the
wilderness
the
sun
has
been
set
a
lucky
hour
and
ye
may
as
weel
get
the
supper
ready
and
a
creel
wi
some
vivers
prepared
noo
that
like
yoursel
sauners
paton
replied
his
wife
and
surely
my
endeavour
shall
not
be
wanting
to
mak
you
comfortable
at
these
words
jamieson
came
also
into
the
mill
and
said
i
hope
miller
the
wife
has
gotten
you
persuaded
o
your
danger
and
that
conform
to
her
kind
wishes
by
which
i
discernt
that
he
had
purposely
egget
her
on
to
urge
her
gudeman
to
take
the
moors
for
the
advantage
of
me
o
aye
replied
the
miller
i
could
na
but
be
consenting
poor
queen
to
lighten
her
anxieties
and
though
for
a
season
he
added
in
a
way
that
i
well
understood
the
eyes
above
may
be
closed
in
slumber
a
watch
will
be
set
to
the
signal
when
it
time
to
be
up
and
ready
therefore
let
us
go
into
the
house
and
cause
no
further
molestation
here
the
three
then
retired
and
comforted
by
the
words
of
this
friendly
mystery
i
confided
myself
to
the
care
of
the
defenceless
sentinel
and
for
several
hours
enjoyed
a
refreshing
oblivion
from
all
my
troubles
and
fears
considering
the
fatigue
i
had
undergone
for
so
many
days
and
nights
together
my
slumber
might
have
been
prolonged
perhaps
till
morning
but
the
worthy
miller
who
withstood
the
urgency
of
his
terrified
wife
to
depart
till
he
thought
i
was
rested
soon
after
the
moon
rose
came
into
the
mill
and
wakened
me
to
make
ready
for
the
road
so
i
left
my
couch
in
the
loft
and
came
down
to
him
and
he
conducted
me
a
little
way
from
the
house
where
bidding
me
wait
he
went
back
and
speedily
returned
with
a
small
basket
in
his
hand
of
the
stores
which
the
mistress
had
provided
for
himself
having
put
the
handle
into
my
hand
he
led
me
down
to
a
steep
shoulder
of
a
precipice
nigh
the
where
telling
me
to
follow
the
path
along
the
bottom
of
the
hills
he
shook
me
with
a
brotherly
affection
by
the
hand
and
bade
me
farewell
saying
in
a
jocose
manner
to
lighten
the
heaviness
with
which
he
saw
my
spirit
was
oppressed
that
the
gudewife
would
make
baith
him
and
johnnie
jamieson
suffer
in
the
body
for
the
fright
she
had
gotten
for
ye
should
ken
said
he
that
the
terror
she
was
in
was
a
bred
o
johnnie
pawkerie
he
knew
that
she
was
aye
in
a
dread
that
i
would
be
laid
hands
on
ever
since
i
signed
the
remonstrance
to
the
laird
and
johnnie
thought
that
if
he
could
get
her
to
send
me
out
provided
for
the
hills
we
would
find
a
way
to
make
the
provision
yours
so
gude
be
wi
you
and
dinna
be
overly
downhearted
when
ye
see
how
wonderfully
ye
are
care
o
being
thus
cherished
cheered
and
exhorted
by
the
worthy
miller
of
inverkip
i
went
on
my
way
with
a
sense
of
renewed
hope
dawning
upon
my
heart
the
night
was
frosty
but
clear
and
the
rippling
of
the
sea
glittered
as
with
a
sparkling
of
gladness
in
the
beams
of
the
moon
then
walking
in
the
fulness
of
her
beauty
over
those
fields
of
holiness
whose
perennial
flowers
are
the
everlasting
stars
but
though
for
a
little
while
my
soul
partook
of
the
blessed
tranquillity
of
the
night
i
had
not
travelled
far
when
the
heaven
of
my
thoughts
was
overcast
grief
for
my
brother
in
the
hands
of
the
oppressors
and
anxiety
for
the
treasures
of
my
hearth
whose
dangers
were
doubtless
increased
by
the
part
i
had
taken
in
the
raid
clouded
my
reason
with
many
fearful
auguries
and
doleful
anticipations
all
care
for
my
own
safety
was
lost
in
those
overwhelming
reflections
in
so
much
that
when
the
morning
air
breathed
upon
me
as
i
reached
the
brow
of
had
i
been
then
questioned
as
to
the
manner
i
had
come
there
verily
i
could
have
given
no
account
for
i
saw
not
neither
did
i
hear
for
many
miles
aught
but
only
the
dismal
tragedies
with
which
busy
imagination
rent
my
heart
with
affliction
and
flooded
my
eyes
with
the
gushing
streams
of
a
softer
sorrow
but
though
my
journey
was
a
continued
experience
of
inward
suffering
i
met
with
no
cause
of
dread
till
i
was
within
sight
of
kilwinning
having
purposed
not
to
go
home
until
i
should
learn
what
had
taken
place
in
my
absence
i
turned
aside
to
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
one
william
brekenrig
a
covenanted
christian
to
inquire
and
to
rest
myself
till
the
evening
scarcely
however
had
i
entered
on
the
path
that
led
to
his
door
when
a
misgiving
of
mind
fell
upon
me
and
i
halted
and
looked
to
see
if
all
about
the
mailing
was
in
its
wonted
state
his
cattle
were
on
the
stubble
the
smoke
stood
over
the
lumhead
in
the
lown
of
the
morning
the
plough
lay
unyoked
on
the
croft
but
it
had
been
lately
used
and
the
furrows
of
part
of
a
rig
were
newly
turned
still
there
was
a
something
that
sent
solemnity
and
coldness
into
my
soul
i
saw
nobody
about
the
farm
which
at
that
time
of
the
day
was
strange
and
unaccountable
nevertheless
i
hastened
forward
and
coming
to
a
i
saw
my
old
friend
leaning
over
it
with
his
head
towards
me
i
called
to
him
by
name
but
he
heeded
me
not
i
ran
to
him
and
touched
him
but
he
was
dead
the
ground
around
where
he
had
rested
himself
and
expired
was
covered
with
his
blood
and
it
was
plain
he
had
not
been
shot
long
for
he
was
warm
and
the
stream
still
trickled
from
the
wound
in
his
side
i
have
no
words
to
tell
what
i
felt
at
the
sight
of
this
woful
murder
but
i
ran
for
help
to
the
house
and
just
as
i
turned
the
corner
of
the
barn
two
soldiers
met
me
and
i
became
their
prisoner
one
of
them
was
a
ruthless
reprobate
who
wanted
to
put
me
to
death
but
the
other
beggit
my
life
at
the
moment
however
my
spirit
was
as
it
were
in
the
midst
of
thunders
and
a
whirlwind
they
took
from
me
my
pistols
and
my
grandfather
sword
and
i
could
not
speak
they
tied
my
hands
behind
me
with
a
cutting
string
and
i
thought
it
was
a
dream
the
air
i
breathed
was
as
suffocating
as
sulphur
i
gasped
with
the
sandy
thirst
of
the
burning
desert
and
my
throat
was
as
the
drowth
of
the
parched
earth
in
the
wilderness
of
kedar
soon
after
this
other
soldiers
came
from
another
farm
where
they
had
been
committing
similar
outrages
and
they
laughed
and
were
merry
as
they
rehearsed
their
exploits
of
guilt
they
taunted
me
and
plucked
me
by
the
lip
but
their
boasting
of
what
they
had
done
flashed
more
fiercely
over
my
spirit
than
even
these
indignities
and
i
inwardly
chided
the
slow
anger
of
the
mysterious
heavens
for
permitting
the
rage
of
those
agents
of
the
apostate
james
sharp
and
his
compeers
whom
a
mansworn
king
had
so
cruelly
dressed
with
his
authority
but
even
in
the
midst
of
these
repinings
and
bitter
breathings
it
was
whispered
into
the
ears
of
my
understanding
as
with
the
voice
of
a
seraph
that
the
lord
in
all
things
moveth
according
to
his
established
laws
and
i
was
comforted
to
think
that
in
the
enormities
whereof
i
was
a
witness
and
partaker
there
was
a
tempering
of
the
hearts
of
the
people
that
they
might
become
as
swords
of
steel
to
work
out
the
deliverance
of
the
land
from
the
bloody
methods
of
prelatic
and
arbitrary
domination
in
so
much
that
when
the
soldiers
prepared
to
return
to
their
quarters
in
irvine
i
walked
with
them
their
captive
it
is
true
but
my
steps
were
firm
and
they
marvelled
to
one
another
at
the
proudness
of
my
tread
there
was
at
the
time
a
general
sorrowing
throughout
the
country
at
the
avenging
visitations
wherewith
all
those
who
had
been
in
the
raid
or
who
had
harboured
the
fugitives
were
visited
hundreds
that
sympathised
with
the
sufferings
of
their
friends
flocked
to
the
town
to
learn
who
had
been
taken
and
who
were
put
to
death
or
reserved
for
punishment
the
crowd
came
pressing
around
as
i
was
conducted
up
the
gait
to
the
tolbooth
the
women
wept
but
the
men
looked
doure
and
the
children
wondered
whatfor
an
honest
man
should
be
brought
to
punishment
some
who
knew
me
cheered
me
by
name
to
keep
a
stout
heart
and
the
soldiers
grew
for
a
rescue
and
gurled
at
the
crowd
for
closing
so
closely
upon
us
as
i
was
ascending
the
i
heard
a
shriek
and
i
looked
around
and
beheld
michael
my
a
stripling
then
only
twelve
years
old
amidst
the
crowd
stretching
out
his
hands
and
crying
o
my
father
my
father
i
halted
for
a
moment
and
the
soldiers
seemed
to
thaw
with
compassion
but
my
hands
were
tied
i
was
a
captive
on
the
threshold
of
the
dungeon
and
i
could
only
shut
my
eyes
and
bid
the
stern
agents
of
the
persecutors
go
on
still
the
cry
of
my
distracted
child
knelled
in
my
ear
and
my
agony
grew
to
such
a
pitch
that
i
flew
forward
up
the
steps
and
in
the
dismal
vaults
within
sought
refuge
from
the
misery
of
my
child
chapter
lxi
i
was
conducted
into
a
straight
and
dark
chamber
and
the
cord
wherewith
my
hands
were
bound
was
untied
and
a
shackle
put
upon
my
right
wrist
the
flesh
of
my
left
was
so
galled
with
the
cord
that
the
jailor
was
softened
at
the
sight
and
from
the
humanity
of
his
own
nature
refrained
from
placing
the
iron
on
it
lest
the
rust
should
fester
the
quick
wound
then
i
was
left
alone
in
the
gloomy
solitude
of
the
and
the
ponderous
doors
were
shut
upon
me
and
the
harsh
bolts
driven
with
a
horrid
grating
noise
that
caused
my
very
bones
to
dinle
but
even
in
that
dreadful
hour
an
unspeakable
consolation
came
with
the
freshness
of
a
breathing
of
the
airs
of
paradise
to
my
soul
methought
a
wonderful
light
shone
around
me
that
i
heard
melodious
voices
bidding
me
be
of
good
cheer
and
that
a
vision
of
my
saintly
grandfather
in
the
glorious
vestments
of
his
heavenly
attire
stood
before
me
and
smiled
upon
me
with
that
holy
comeliness
of
countenance
which
has
made
his
image
in
my
remembrance
ever
that
of
the
most
venerable
of
men
so
that
in
the
very
depth
of
what
i
thought
would
have
been
the
pit
of
despair
i
had
a
delightful
taste
of
those
blessed
experiences
of
divine
aid
by
which
the
holy
martyrs
were
sustained
in
the
hours
of
trial
and
cheered
amidst
the
torments
in
which
they
sealed
the
truth
of
their
testimony
after
the
favour
of
that
sweet
and
celestial
encouragement
i
laid
myself
down
on
a
pallet
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
a
gracious
sleep
descended
upon
my
eyelids
and
steeped
the
sense
and
memory
of
my
griefs
in
forgetfulness
when
i
woke
the
day
was
far
spent
and
the
light
through
the
iron
stainchers
of
the
little
window
showed
that
the
shadows
of
the
twilight
were
darkening
over
the
world
i
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
and
listened
to
the
murmur
of
the
multitude
that
i
heard
still
lingering
around
the
prison
and
sometimes
i
thought
that
i
discovered
the
voice
of
a
friend
in
that
situation
and
thinking
of
all
those
dear
cares
which
filled
my
heart
with
tenderness
and
fear
and
of
the
agonising
grief
of
my
little
boy
the
sound
of
whose
cries
still
echoed
in
my
bosom
i
rose
upon
my
knees
and
committed
myself
entirely
to
the
custody
of
him
that
can
give
the
light
of
liberty
to
the
captive
even
in
the
gloom
of
the
dungeon
and
when
i
had
done
so
i
again
prepared
to
lay
myself
on
the
ground
but
a
rustle
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
drew
my
attention
and
in
the
same
moment
a
kind
hand
was
laid
on
mine
sarah
lochrig
said
i
for
i
knew
my
wife
gentle
pressure
how
is
it
that
you
are
with
me
in
this
doleful
place
how
found
you
entrance
and
i
not
hear
you
come
in
but
before
she
had
time
to
make
any
answer
another
fond
arms
were
round
my
neck
and
my
affectionate
young
michael
wept
upon
my
shoulder
bear
with
me
courteous
reader
when
i
think
of
those
things
that
wife
and
that
child
and
all
that
i
loved
so
fondly
are
no
more
but
it
is
not
meet
that
i
should
yet
tell
how
my
spirit
was
turned
into
iron
and
my
heart
into
stone
therefore
will
i
still
endeavour
to
relate
as
with
the
equanimity
of
one
that
writes
but
of
indifferent
things
what
further
ensued
during
the
thirteen
days
of
my
captivity
sarah
lochrig
with
the
mildness
of
her
benign
voice
when
we
had
mingled
a
few
tears
told
me
that
after
i
went
to
galloway
with
martha
swinton
she
had
been
moved
by
our
neighbours
to
come
with
our
children
into
the
town
as
being
safer
for
a
lanerly
woman
and
a
family
left
without
its
head
and
a
providential
thing
it
was
that
she
had
done
so
for
on
the
very
night
that
my
brother
came
off
with
the
men
of
the
parish
to
join
us
as
i
have
noted
down
in
its
proper
place
a
gang
of
dragoons
plundered
both
his
house
and
mine
and
but
that
our
treasures
had
been
timeously
removed
his
family
having
also
gone
that
day
into
kilmarnock
the
outrages
might
have
been
unspeakable
we
then
had
some
household
discourse
anent
what
was
to
be
done
in
the
event
of
things
coming
to
the
worst
with
me
and
it
was
an
admiration
to
hear
with
what
constancy
of
reason
and
the
gifts
of
a
supported
judgment
that
woman
spoke
of
what
she
would
do
with
her
children
if
it
was
the
lord
pleasure
to
honour
me
with
the
crown
of
martyrdom
but
said
she
i
hae
an
assurance
within
that
some
great
thing
is
yet
in
store
for
you
though
the
hope
be
clouded
with
a
doubt
that
i
no
be
to
see
it
and
therefore
let
us
not
despond
at
this
time
but
use
the
means
that
providence
may
afford
to
effect
your
deliverance
while
we
were
thus
conversing
together
the
doors
of
the
were
opened
and
a
man
was
let
in
who
had
a
cruisie
in
the
one
hand
and
a
basket
in
the
other
he
was
lean
and
bordering
on
forty
years
and
of
a
melancholy
complexion
his
eye
was
quick
deep
set
and
a
thought
wild
his
long
hair
was
carefully
combed
smooth
and
his
apparel
was
singularly
well
composed
for
a
person
of
his
degree
having
set
down
the
lamp
on
the
floor
he
came
in
a
very
reverential
manner
towards
where
i
was
sitting
with
my
right
hand
fettered
to
the
ground
between
sarah
lochrig
and
michael
our
son
and
he
said
with
a
remarkable
and
gentle
simplicity
of
voice
in
the
highland
accent
that
he
had
been
requested
by
a
righteous
woman
provost
reid
wife
to
bring
me
a
bottle
of
cordial
wine
and
some
little
matters
that
i
might
require
for
bodily
consolation
it
that
godly
creature
willie
sutherland
the
hangman
said
my
wife
though
providence
has
dealt
hardly
with
him
poor
man
in
this
life
every
body
says
he
has
gotten
arles
of
a
servitude
in
glory
hereafter
when
he
had
placed
the
basket
at
the
knees
of
michael
he
retired
to
a
corner
of
the
room
and
stood
in
the
shadow
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
wall
saying
i
concer
that
it
no
in
my
power
to
leave
you
to
yoursels
till
mungo
robeson
come
back
for
he
has
lockit
me
in
but
i
no
hearken
to
what
ye
may
say
and
there
was
a
modesty
of
manner
in
the
way
that
he
said
this
which
made
me
think
it
not
possible
he
could
be
of
so
base
a
vocation
as
the
public
executioner
and
i
whispered
my
opinion
of
him
to
sarah
lochrig
it
was
however
the
case
and
verily
in
the
life
and
conduct
of
that
simple
and
pious
man
there
was
a
manifestation
of
the
truth
that
to
him
whom
the
lord
favours
it
signifieth
not
whatsoever
his
earthly
condition
may
be
after
i
had
partaken
with
my
wife
and
son
of
some
refreshment
which
they
had
brought
with
them
and
tasted
of
the
wine
that
provost
reid
lady
had
sent
we
heard
the
bolts
of
the
door
drawn
and
the
clanking
of
keys
at
which
willie
sutherland
came
forward
from
the
corner
where
he
had
stood
during
the
whole
time
and
lifting
the
lamp
from
the
floor
and
wetting
his
with
spittle
as
he
did
so
he
trimmed
the
wick
and
said
the
time
come
when
a
persons
not
prisoners
must
depart
forth
the
tolbooth
for
the
night
but
master
gilhaize
be
none
discomforted
thereat
your
wife
and
your
little
one
will
come
back
in
the
morning
and
your
lot
is
a
lot
of
pleasure
for
is
it
not
written
in
the
book
of
ecclesiastes
fourth
and
eighth
is
one
alone
and
there
is
not
a
second
yea
he
hath
neither
child
nor
brother
and
such
an
one
am
i
the
inner
door
was
thrown
open
and
mungo
robeson
looking
in
said
i
wae
to
molest
you
but
ye
hae
to
come
out
mrs
gilhaize
so
that
night
we
were
separated
and
when
sarah
lochrig
was
gone
i
could
not
but
offer
thanksgiving
that
my
lines
had
fallen
in
so
pleasant
a
place
compared
with
the
fate
of
my
poor
brother
suffering
among
strangers
in
the
doleful
prison
of
glasgow
under
the
ravenous
eyes
of
the
prelate
of
that
city
then
scarcely
less
hungry
for
the
bodies
of
the
faithful
and
the
true
than
even
the
apostate
james
sharp
himself
chapter
lxii
the
deep
sleep
into
which
i
had
fallen
when
sarah
lochrig
and
my
son
were
admitted
to
see
me
and
during
the
season
of
which
they
had
sat
in
silence
beside
me
till
revived
nature
again
unsealed
my
eyes
was
so
refreshing
that
after
they
were
gone
away
i
was
enabled
to
consider
my
condition
with
a
composed
mind
and
free
from
the
heats
of
passion
and
anxiety
wherewith
i
had
previously
been
so
greatly
tossed
and
calling
to
mind
all
that
had
taken
place
and
the
ruthless
revenge
with
which
the
cruel
prelates
were
actuated
i
saw
as
it
were
written
in
a
book
that
for
my
part
and
conduct
i
was
doomed
to
die
i
felt
not
however
the
sense
of
guilt
in
my
conscience
and
i
said
to
myself
that
this
sore
thing
ought
not
to
be
and
that
as
an
innocent
man
and
the
head
of
a
family
i
was
obligated
by
all
expedient
ways
to
escape
if
it
were
possible
from
the
grasps
of
the
tyranny
so
from
that
time
the
first
night
of
my
imprisonment
i
set
myself
to
devise
the
means
of
working
out
my
deliverance
and
i
was
not
long
without
an
encouraging
glimmer
of
hope
it
seemed
to
me
that
in
the
piety
and
simplicity
of
willie
sutherland
instruments
were
given
by
which
i
might
break
through
the
walls
of
my
prison
and
accordingly
when
he
next
morning
came
in
to
see
me
i
failed
not
to
try
their
edge
i
entered
into
discourse
with
him
and
told
him
of
many
things
which
i
have
recorded
in
this
book
and
so
won
upon
his
confidence
and
the
singleness
of
his
heart
that
he
shed
tears
of
grief
at
the
thought
of
so
many
blameless
men
being
ordained
to
an
untimely
end
it
has
pleased
god
said
he
to
make
me
as
it
were
a
leper
and
an
excommunicant
in
this
world
by
the
constraints
of
a
low
estate
and
without
any
fault
of
mine
but
for
this
temporal
ignominy
he
will
in
his
own
good
time
bestow
an
exceeding
great
reward
and
though
i
may
be
called
on
to
fulfil
the
work
of
the
persecutors
it
shall
yet
be
seen
of
me
that
i
will
abide
by
the
integrity
of
my
faith
and
that
poor
despised
hangman
as
i
am
i
have
a
conscience
that
will
not
brook
a
task
of
iniquity
whatsoever
the
laws
of
man
may
determine
or
the
king
judges
decree
i
was
as
it
were
rebuked
by
this
proud
religious
declaration
and
i
gently
inquired
how
it
was
that
he
came
to
fall
into
a
condition
so
rejected
of
the
world
deed
sir
said
he
my
tale
is
easy
told
my
parents
were
very
poor
needful
people
in
strathnavar
and
no
able
to
keep
me
and
it
happened
that
being
cast
on
the
world
i
became
a
herd
and
year
by
year
having
a
desire
to
learn
the
lowland
tongue
i
got
in
that
way
as
far
as
paisley
where
i
fell
into
extreme
want
and
was
almost
famished
for
the
master
that
i
served
there
being
in
debt
ran
away
by
which
cause
i
lost
my
penny
fee
and
was
obligated
to
beg
my
bread
at
that
time
many
worthy
folk
in
the
shire
of
renfrew
having
suffered
great
molestation
from
witchcraft
divers
malignant
women
suspectit
of
that
black
art
were
brought
to
judgment
and
one
of
them
being
found
guilty
was
condemned
to
die
but
no
executioner
being
in
the
town
i
was
engaged
by
the
scriptural
counsel
of
some
honest
men
who
quoted
to
me
the
text
not
a
witch
to
live
to
fulfil
the
sentence
of
the
law
after
that
i
bought
a
having
a
mind
to
learn
to
read
that
i
might
gain
some
knowledge
of
the
word
finding
however
the
people
of
paisley
scorn
at
my
company
so
that
none
would
give
me
a
lesson
i
came
about
five
years
since
to
irvine
where
the
folk
are
more
charitable
and
here
i
act
the
part
of
an
executioner
when
there
is
any
malefactor
to
put
to
death
but
my
bible
has
instructed
me
that
i
ought
not
to
execute
any
save
such
as
deserve
to
die
so
that
if
ye
should
be
condemned
as
like
is
you
will
be
my
conscience
will
allow
me
to
execute
you
for
i
see
you
are
a
christian
man
i
was
moved
with
a
tender
pity
by
the
tale
of
the
simple
creature
but
a
strong
necessity
was
upon
me
and
it
was
needful
that
i
should
make
use
of
his
honesty
to
help
me
out
of
prison
so
i
spoke
still
more
kindly
to
him
lamenting
my
sad
estate
and
that
in
the
little
time
i
had
in
all
likelihood
to
live
the
rigour
of
the
jailor
would
allow
but
little
intercourse
with
my
family
wishing
some
compassionate
christian
friend
would
intercede
with
him
in
order
that
my
wife
and
children
if
not
permitted
to
bide
all
night
might
be
allowed
to
remain
with
me
as
long
and
as
late
as
possible
the
pious
creature
said
that
he
would
do
for
me
in
that
respect
all
in
his
power
and
that
as
mungo
robeson
was
a
sober
man
and
aye
wanted
to
go
home
early
to
his
family
he
would
bide
in
the
tolbooth
to
let
out
my
wife
though
it
should
be
till
ten
at
night
for
said
he
piteously
i
hae
nae
family
to
care
about
accordingly
he
so
set
himself
that
mungo
robeson
consented
to
leave
the
keys
of
the
tolbooth
with
him
and
for
several
nights
everything
was
so
managed
that
he
had
no
reason
to
suspect
what
my
wife
and
i
were
plotting
for
he
being
of
a
modest
and
retiring
nature
never
spoke
to
her
when
she
parted
from
me
save
when
she
thanked
him
as
he
let
her
out
and
that
she
did
not
do
every
night
lest
it
should
grow
into
a
habit
of
expectation
with
him
and
cause
him
to
remark
when
the
civility
was
omitted
in
the
meantime
all
things
being
concerted
between
us
through
the
mean
of
a
friend
a
cart
was
got
in
readiness
loaded
with
seemingly
a
hogget
of
tobacco
and
grocery
wares
but
the
hogget
was
empty
and
loose
in
the
head
this
was
all
settled
by
the
nineteenth
of
december
on
the
of
the
month
the
commissioners
appointed
to
try
the
covenanters
in
the
prisons
throughout
the
shire
of
ayr
were
to
open
their
court
at
ayr
and
i
was
by
all
who
knew
of
me
regarded
in
a
manner
as
a
dead
man
on
the
night
of
the
twentieth
however
shortly
before
ten
james
gottera
our
friend
came
with
the
cart
in
at
the
port
and
in
going
down
the
gait
stopped
as
had
been
agreed
to
give
his
beast
a
drink
at
the
trough
of
the
opposite
the
foot
when
the
clock
struck
ten
the
time
appointed
i
was
ready
dressed
in
my
wife
apparel
having
in
the
course
of
the
day
broken
the
chain
of
the
shackle
on
my
arm
and
the
door
being
opened
by
willie
sutherland
in
the
usual
manner
i
came
out
holding
a
napkin
to
my
face
and
weeping
in
sincerity
very
bitterly
with
the
thought
of
what
might
ensue
to
sarah
lochrig
whom
i
left
behind
in
my
place
in
reverence
to
my
grief
the
honest
man
said
nothing
but
walked
by
my
side
till
he
had
let
me
out
at
the
outer
door
where
he
parted
from
me
carrying
the
keys
to
mungo
robeson
house
aneath
the
tolbooth
while
i
walked
towards
james
gottera
cart
and
was
presently
in
the
inside
of
the
hogget
with
great
presence
of
mind
and
a
soldierly
that
venturous
friend
then
drew
the
horse
head
from
the
trough
and
began
to
drive
it
down
the
street
to
the
port
striving
as
he
did
so
to
whistle
till
he
was
rebuked
for
so
doing
as
i
heard
by
an
old
woman
then
going
home
who
said
to
him
that
it
was
a
shame
to
hear
such
profanity
in
irvine
when
a
martyr
doomed
to
die
was
lying
in
the
tolbooth
to
the
which
he
replied
scoffingly
that
martyr
was
a
new
name
for
a
sworn
rebel
to
king
and
country
words
which
so
kindled
the
worthy
woman
ire
that
she
began
to
ban
his
prelatic
ungodliness
to
such
a
degree
that
a
crowd
collected
which
made
me
tremble
for
the
people
sided
with
the
zealous
carlan
and
spoke
fiercely
threatening
to
gar
james
gottera
ride
the
stang
for
his
sinfulness
in
so
traducing
persecuted
christians
what
might
have
come
to
pass
is
hard
to
say
had
not
providence
been
pleased
in
that
most
critical
and
perilous
time
to
cause
a
foul
lum
in
a
thacket
house
in
the
to
take
fire
by
which
an
alarm
was
spread
that
drew
off
the
mob
and
allowed
james
gottera
to
pass
without
farther
molestation
out
at
the
port
chapter
lxiii
from
the
time
of
my
evasion
from
the
tolbooth
and
during
the
controversy
between
james
gottera
and
the
mob
in
the
street
there
was
a
whirlwind
in
my
mind
that
made
me
incapable
of
reason
but
when
we
had
passed
through
the
port
and
the
cart
had
stopped
at
the
minister
carse
till
i
could
throw
off
my
female
weeds
and
put
on
a
sailor
garb
provided
for
the
occasion
tongue
nor
pen
can
not
express
the
passion
wherewith
my
yearning
soul
was
then
affected
the
thought
of
having
left
sarah
lochrig
within
bolts
and
bars
a
ready
victim
to
the
tyranny
which
so
thirsted
for
blood
lightened
within
me
as
the
lightnings
of
heaven
in
a
storm
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
i
grasped
the
earth
i
gathered
myself
as
it
were
into
a
knot
and
howled
with
horror
at
my
own
selfish
baseness
i
sprung
up
and
cried
i
will
save
her
yet
and
i
would
have
run
instanter
to
the
town
but
the
honest
man
who
was
with
me
laid
his
grip
firmly
upon
my
arm
and
said
in
a
solemn
manner
this
is
no
christian
conduct
ringan
gilhaize
the
lord
has
not
forgotten
to
be
gracious
i
glowered
upon
him
as
he
has
often
since
told
me
with
a
shudder
and
cried
but
i
hae
left
sarah
lochrig
in
their
hands
and
like
a
coward
run
away
to
save
mysel
compose
yoursel
ringan
and
let
us
reason
together
was
his
discreet
reply
it
vera
true
ye
hae
come
away
and
left
your
wife
as
it
were
an
hostage
in
the
prison
but
the
persecutors
and
oppressors
will
respek
the
courageous
affection
of
a
loving
wife
and
providence
will
put
it
in
their
hearts
to
spare
her
and
if
they
do
not
what
shall
i
then
be
and
what
to
become
of
my
babies
lord
lord
thou
hast
tried
me
beyond
my
strength
and
i
again
threw
myself
on
the
earth
and
cried
that
it
might
open
and
swallow
me
for
thinking
but
of
myself
i
was
becoming
unworthy
to
live
the
considerate
man
stood
over
me
in
compassionate
silence
for
a
season
and
allowed
me
to
rave
in
my
frenzy
till
i
had
exhausted
myself
ringan
said
he
at
last
ye
were
aye
respekit
as
a
thoughtful
and
discreet
character
and
i
no
blame
you
for
this
sorrow
but
i
entreat
you
to
collek
yersel
and
think
what
best
to
be
done
for
what
avails
in
trouble
the
cry
of
alas
alas
or
the
shedding
of
many
tears
your
wife
is
in
prison
but
for
a
fault
that
will
wring
compassion
even
frae
the
brazen
heart
of
the
remorseless
james
sharp
and
bring
back
the
blood
of
humanity
to
the
mansworn
breast
of
charles
stuart
but
though
it
were
not
so
they
daurna
harm
a
hair
of
her
head
for
there
are
things
man
that
the
cruellest
dread
to
do
for
fear
o
the
world
even
when
they
hae
lost
the
fear
o
god
i
count
her
far
safer
ringan
frae
the
rage
of
the
persecutors
where
she
lies
in
prison
aneath
their
bolts
and
bars
than
were
she
free
in
her
own
house
for
it
obligates
them
to
deal
wi
her
openly
and
afore
mankind
whose
goodwill
the
worst
of
princes
and
prelates
are
from
an
inward
power
forced
to
respek
whereas
were
she
sitting
lanerly
and
defenceless
wi
naebody
near
but
only
your
four
helpless
wee
birds
there
no
saying
what
the
gleds
might
do
therefore
be
counselled
my
frien
and
dinna
yoursel
up
utterly
to
despair
but
like
a
man
for
whom
the
lord
has
already
done
great
things
mak
use
of
the
means
which
in
this
jeopardy
of
a
that
sae
dear
to
you
he
has
so
graciously
put
in
your
power
i
felt
myself
in
a
measure
heartened
by
this
exhortation
and
rising
from
the
ground
completed
the
change
i
had
begun
in
my
apparel
but
i
was
still
unable
to
speak
which
he
observing
said
hae
ye
considered
the
airt
ye
ought
now
to
take
for
it
canna
be
that
ye
think
of
biding
in
this
neighbourhood
no
not
in
this
land
i
exclaimed
would
that
i
might
not
even
in
this
life
whisht
ringan
gilhaize
that
a
sinful
wish
for
a
christian
said
a
compassionate
voice
at
my
side
which
made
us
both
start
and
on
looking
round
we
saw
a
man
who
during
the
earnestest
of
our
controversy
had
approached
close
to
us
unobserved
it
was
that
my
mr
witherspoon
and
his
sudden
apparition
at
that
time
was
a
blessed
accident
which
did
more
to
draw
my
thoughts
from
the
anguish
of
my
affections
than
any
thing
it
was
possible
for
james
gottera
to
have
said
he
was
then
travelling
in
the
cloud
of
night
to
the
town
having
after
i
parted
from
him
in
lanerkshire
endured
many
hardships
and
perils
and
his
intent
was
to
pass
to
his
friends
in
order
to
raise
a
trifle
of
money
to
transport
himself
for
a
season
into
ireland
but
james
gottera
on
hearing
this
interposed
his
opinion
and
said
a
rumour
was
abroad
that
in
all
ports
and
towns
of
embarkation
orders
were
given
to
stay
the
departure
of
passengers
so
that
to
a
surety
he
would
be
taken
if
he
attempted
to
quit
the
kingdom
by
this
time
my
mind
had
returned
into
something
like
a
state
of
sobriety
so
i
told
him
how
it
had
been
concerted
between
me
and
sarah
lochrig
that
i
should
pass
over
to
the
wee
cumbrae
there
to
wait
till
the
destroyers
had
passed
by
for
it
was
thought
not
possible
that
such
an
inordinate
thirst
for
blood
as
had
followed
upon
our
discomfiture
at
could
be
of
a
long
continuance
and
i
beseeched
him
to
come
with
me
telling
him
that
i
was
provided
with
a
small
purse
of
money
in
case
need
should
require
it
but
in
the
charitable
hearts
of
the
pious
we
might
count
on
a
richer
store
accordingly
we
agreed
to
join
our
fortunes
again
and
having
parted
from
james
gottera
at
kilwinning
we
went
on
our
way
together
and
my
heart
was
refreshed
by
the
kind
admonitions
and
sweet
converse
of
my
companion
though
ever
and
anon
the
thought
of
my
wife
in
prison
and
our
defenceless
lambs
shot
like
a
fiery
arrow
through
my
bosom
but
man
is
by
nature
a
sordid
creature
and
the
piercing
december
blast
the
threatening
sky
and
the
frequent
shower
soon
knit
up
my
thoughts
with
the
care
of
my
worthless
self
maybe
there
was
in
that
the
tempering
hand
of
a
beneficent
providence
for
when
i
have
at
divers
times
since
considered
how
much
the
anguish
of
my
inner
sufferings
exceeded
the
bodily
molestation
i
could
not
but
confess
though
it
was
with
a
humbled
sense
of
my
own
selfishness
that
it
was
well
for
me
in
such
a
time
to
be
so
respited
from
the
upbraidings
of
my
tortured
affections
but
not
to
dwell
on
the
specialities
of
my
own
feelings
on
that
memorable
night
let
it
suffice
that
after
walking
some
four
or
five
miles
towards
pencorse
ferry
where
we
meant
to
pass
to
the
island
i
became
less
and
less
attentive
to
the
edifying
discourse
of
mr
witherspoon
and
his
nature
also
yielding
to
the
influences
of
the
time
we
travelled
along
the
bleak
and
sandy
shore
between
ardrossan
and
kilbride
hill
without
the
interchange
of
conversation
the
wind
came
wild
and
gurly
from
the
sea
the
waves
broke
heavily
on
the
shore
and
the
moon
swiftly
wading
the
cloud
threw
over
the
dreary
scene
a
wandering
and
ghastly
light
often
to
the
blast
we
were
obligated
to
turn
our
backs
and
the
rain
being
in
our
faces
we
little
heeded
each
other
in
that
state
so
like
sullenness
we
had
journeyed
onward
it
might
be
better
than
a
mile
when
happening
to
observe
something
lying
on
the
shore
as
if
it
had
been
cast
out
by
the
sea
i
cried
under
a
sense
of
fear
stop
mr
witherspoon
what
that
in
the
same
moment
he
uttered
a
dreadful
sound
of
horror
and
on
looking
round
i
saw
we
were
three
in
company
in
the
name
of
heaven
exclaimed
mr
witherspoon
who
and
what
are
you
that
walk
with
us
but
instanter
our
fears
and
the
mystery
of
the
appearance
were
dispelled
for
it
was
my
brother
chapter
lxiv
weel
ringan
said
my
brother
we
have
met
again
in
this
world
a
blessing
i
never
looked
for
and
he
held
out
his
two
hands
to
take
hold
of
mine
but
the
broken
links
of
the
shackle
still
round
my
wrist
made
him
cry
out
what
this
whare
hae
ye
come
fra
but
i
need
na
inquire
i
have
broken
out
of
the
tolbooth
o
irvine
said
i
and
i
am
fleeing
here
with
mr
witherspoon
i
too
replied
my
brother
mournfully
hae
escaped
from
the
hands
of
the
persecutors
we
then
entered
into
some
conversation
concerning
what
had
happened
to
us
respectively
from
the
fatal
of
november
when
our
power
and
host
were
scattered
on
wherein
mr
witherspoon
with
me
rehearsed
to
him
the
accidents
herein
set
forth
with
the
circumstantials
of
some
things
that
befel
the
godly
man
after
i
left
him
with
the
corpse
of
the
baby
in
his
arms
but
which
being
in
some
points
less
of
an
adventurous
nature
than
had
happened
to
myself
i
shall
be
pardoned
by
the
courteous
reader
for
not
enlarging
upon
it
at
greater
length
i
should
however
here
note
that
mr
witherspoon
was
not
so
severely
dealt
with
as
i
was
for
though
an
outcast
and
a
fugitive
yet
he
was
not
a
prisoner
on
the
contrary
under
the
kindly
cover
of
the
lady
auchterfardel
whose
excellent
and
truly
covenanted
husband
was
a
sore
sufferer
by
the
fines
of
the
year
he
received
great
hospitality
for
the
space
of
sixteen
days
and
was
saved
between
two
feather
beds
on
the
top
of
which
the
laird
aged
mother
a
woman
was
laid
when
some
of
drummond
men
searched
the
house
on
an
information
against
him
but
disconsolatory
as
it
was
to
hear
of
such
treatment
of
a
though
lightened
by
the
reflection
of
the
saintly
constancy
that
was
yet
to
be
found
in
the
land
and
among
persons
too
of
the
lady
of
auchterfardel
degree
and
severe
as
the
trials
were
both
of
body
and
mind
which
i
had
myself
undergone
yet
were
they
all
as
nothing
compared
to
the
hardships
of
my
brother
a
man
of
a
temperate
sobriety
of
manner
bearing
all
changes
with
a
serene
countenance
and
a
placable
mind
while
feeling
them
in
the
uttermost
depths
of
his
capacious
affections
on
the
night
of
the
battle
said
he
it
would
not
be
easy
of
me
to
tell
which
way
i
went
or
what
ensued
till
i
found
myself
with
three
destitute
companions
on
the
skirts
of
the
town
of
falkirk
by
that
time
the
morning
was
beginning
to
dawn
and
we
perceived
not
that
we
had
approached
so
nigh
unto
any
bigget
land
as
the
day
however
broke
the
steeple
caught
our
eye
and
we
halted
to
consider
what
we
ought
to
do
and
as
we
were
then
standing
in
a
field
diffident
to
enter
the
town
a
young
woman
came
from
a
house
that
stands
a
little
way
off
the
road
close
to
graham
dyke
driving
a
cow
to
grass
with
a
long
staff
which
i
the
more
remarked
as
such
because
it
was
of
the
indian
cane
and
virled
with
silver
and
headed
with
ivory
said
menie
adams
for
that
was
the
damsel
name
see
what
ye
are
but
i
no
speir
howsever
be
ruled
by
me
and
gang
na
near
the
town
of
falkirk
this
morning
for
atwish
the
hours
of
dark
and
dawn
there
has
been
a
congregationing
o
horses
and
men
and
other
sediments
o
war
that
i
hae
a
notion

owre
meikle
o
the
king

in
the
place
for
any
covenanter
to
enter
in
save
under
the
peril

but
come
wi
me
and
i
go
back
wi
you
and
in
our
you
may
scog
yoursels
till
the
gloaming
who
could
have
thought
said
my
brother
that
in
such
discourse
from
a
young
woman
not
passing
years
of
age
and
of
a
pleasant
aspect
any
guilty
stratagem
of
blood
was
hidden
he
and
his
friends
never
questioned
her
truth
but
went
with
her
and
she
conducted
them
to
her
father
house
and
lodged
them
in
the
it
seems
that
menie
adams
was
however
at
the
time
betrothed
to
the
prelatic
curate
that
had
been
laid
upon
the
parish
and
that
in
consequence
aneath
her
courtesy
she
had
concealed
a
very
treacherous
and
wicked
intent
for
no
sooner
had
she
got
my
brother
and
his
three
companions
into
the
than
she
hies
herself
away
to
the
town
and
in
the
hope
of
pleasing
her
prelatic
lover
informs
the
captain
of
the
troop
there
of
the
birds
she
had
ensnared
as
soon
as
the
false
woman
had
thus
committed
the
sin
of
perfidy
she
went
to
the
curate
to
brag
how
she
had
done
a
service
to
his
cause
but
he
though
of
the
prelatic
germination
being
yet
a
person
who
had
some
reverence
for
truth
and
the
gentle
mercies
of
humanity
was
so
disturbed
by
her
unwomanly
disposition
that
he
bade
her
depart
from
his
presence
for
ever
and
ran
with
all
possible
speed
to
waken
the
poor
men
whom
she
had
so
betrayed
on
his
way
to
the
house
he
saw
a
party
of
the
soldiers
whom
their
officer
as
in
duty
bound
was
sending
to
seize
the
unsuspecting
sleepers
and
running
on
before
them
he
just
got
forward
in
time
to
give
the
alarm
my
brother
and
one
of
them
esau
wardrop
the
brother
of
james
gottera
who
had
been
so
instrumental
in
my
evasion
were
providentially
enabled
to
get
out
and
flee
but
the
other
two
were
taken
by
the
soldiers
and
carried
to
prison
the
base
conduct
of
that
menie
adams
as
we
some
years
after
heard
did
not
go
long
unvisited
by
the
displeasure
of
heaven
for
some
scent
of
her
guilt
taking
wind
the
whole
town
in
a
sense
grew
wud
against
her
and
she
was
mobbet
and
the
wells
pumped
upon
her
by
the
enraged
multitude
and
she
never
recovered
from
the
handling
that
she
therein
suffered
my
brother
and
esau
wardrop
on
getting
into
the
open
fields
made
all
the
speed
they
could
like
the
panting
hart
when
pursued
by
the
hunter
and
distrusting
the
people
of
that
part
of
the
country
they
travelled
all
day
not
venturing
to
approach
any
reeking
house
towards
gloaming
however
being
hungry
and
faint
the
craving
of
nature
overcame
their
fears
and
they
went
up
to
a
house
where
they
saw
a
light
burning
as
they
approached
the
door
they
faltered
a
little
in
their
resolution
for
they
heard
the
dissonance
of
riot
and
revelry
within
their
need
however
was
great
and
the
importunities
of
hunger
would
not
be
pacified
so
they
knocked
and
the
door
was
soon
opened
by
a
soldier
the
party
within
being
a
horde
of
dalziel
men
living
at
free
quarters
in
the
house
of
that
excellent
christian
and
man
the
laird
of
ringlewood
chapter
lxv
the
moment
that
the
man
who
came
to
the
door
saw
by
the
glimpse
of
the
light
that
both
my
brother
and
esau
wardrop
had
swords
at
their
sides
he
uttered
a
cry
of
alarm
thinking
the
house
was
surrounded
at
which
all
the
riotous
soldiers
within
flew
to
their
arms
while
the
man
who
opened
the
door
seized
my
brother
by
the
throat
and
him
in
the
panic
however
was
but
of
short
duration
for
my
brother
soon
expounded
that
they
were
two
perishing
men
who
came
to
surrender
themselves
so
the
door
was
again
opened
and
esau
wardrop
commanded
to
come
in
it
but
a
justice
to
say
of
those
rampageous
troopers
said
my
brother
that
considering
us
as
prisoners
of
war
they
were
free
and
kind
enough
though
they
mocked
at
our
cause
and
derided
the
equipage
of
our
warfare
but
it
was
a
humiliating
sight
to
see
in
what
manner
they
deported
themselves
towards
the
unfortunate
family
ringlewood
himself
who
had
remonstrated
against
their
insolence
to
his
aged
leddy
they
had
tied
in
his
and
placed
at
the
head
of
his
own
table
round
which
they
sat
carousing
and
singing
the
roister
ribaldry
of
camp
songs
at
first
when
my
brother
was
taken
into
this
scene
of
military
domination
he
did
not
observe
the
laird
for
in
the
uproar
of
the
alarm
the
candles
had
been
overset
and
broken
but
new
ones
being
sworn
for
and
stuck
into
the
necks
of
the
bottles
of
the
wine
they
were
lavishly
drinking
he
discovered
him
lying
as
it
were
asleep
where
he
sat
with
his
head
averted
and
his
eyes
shut
on
the
iniquity
of
the
scene
of
oppression
with
which
he
was
oppressed
some
touch
of
contrition
had
led
one
of
the
soldiers
to
take
the
aged
matron
under
his
care
and
on
his
intercession
she
was
not
placed
at
the
table
but
allowed
to
sit
in
a
corner
where
she
mourned
in
silence
with
her
hands
clasped
together
and
her
head
bent
down
over
them
upon
her
breast
the
laird
grandson
and
heir
a
stripling
of
some
fifteen
years
or
so
was
obligated
to
be
page
and
butler
for
all
the
rest
of
the
house
had
taken
to
the
hills
at
the
approach
of
the
troopers
as
the
drinking
continued
the
riot
increased
and
the
rioters
growing
heated
with
their
drink
they
began
to
quarrel
fierce
words
brought
angry
answers
and
threats
were
followed
by
blows
then
there
was
an
interposition
and
a
shaking
of
hands
and
a
pledging
of
renewed
friendship
but
still
the
demon
of
the
drink
continued
to
grow
stronger
and
stronger
in
their
kindling
blood
and
the
tumult
was
made
perfect
by
one
of
the
men
in
the
capering
of
his
inebriety
rising
from
his
seat
and
taking
the
old
leddy
by
the
toupie
to
raise
her
head
as
he
rudely
placed
his
foul
cup
to
her
lips
this
called
up
the
ire
of
the
fellow
who
had
sworn
to
protect
her
and
he
not
less
intoxicated
than
the
insulter
came
staggering
to
defend
her
a
scuffle
ensued
the
insulter
was
cast
with
a
swing
away
and
falling
against
the
laird
who
still
remained
as
it
were
asleep
with
his
head
on
his
shoulder
and
his
eyes
shut
he
overthrew
the
chair
in
which
the
old
gentleman
sat
fastened
and
they
both
fell
to
the
ground
the
soldier
frantic
with
wine
and
rage
was
soon
like
a
tiger
on
his
adversary
the
rest
rose
to
separate
them
some
took
one
side
some
another
bottles
were
seized
for
weapons
and
the
table
was
overthrown
in
the
hurricane
their
sergeant
who
was
as
drunk
as
the
worst
of
them
tried
in
vain
to
call
them
into
order
but
they
heeded
not
his
call
which
so
enraged
him
that
he
swore
they
should
shift
their
quarters
and
with
that
seizing
a
burning
brand
from
the
chumla
he
ran
into
a
bedchamber
that
opened
from
the
room
where
the
riot
was
raging
and
set
fire
to
the
curtains
my
brother
seeing
the
flames
rising
and
that
the
infuriated
thought
only
of
themselves
ran
to
extricate
ringlewood
from
the
cords
with
which
he
was
tied
and
calling
to
the
leddy
and
her
grandson
to
quit
the
burning
house
every
one
was
soon
out
of
danger
from
the
fire
the
sense
of
the
soldiers
were
not
so
overborne
by
their
drink
as
to
prevent
them
from
seeing
the
dreadful
extent
of
their
outrage
but
instead
of
trying
to
extinguish
the
flames
they
marched
away
to
seek
quarters
in
some
other
place
cursing
the
sergeant
for
having
so
unhoused
them
in
such
a
night
at
first
they
thought
of
carrying
my
brother
and
esau
wardrop
with
them
as
prisoners
but
one
of
them
said
it
would
be
as
well
to
give
the
wyte
of
the
burning
at
headquarters
to
the
rebels
so
they
left
them
behind
esau
wardrop
with
the
young
laird
and
my
grandfather
seeing
it
was
in
vain
to
stop
the
progress
of
the
fire
did
all
that
in
them
lay
to
rescue
some
of
the
furniture
while
poor
old
ringlewood
and
his
aged
and
gentle
lady
being
both
too
infirm
to
lend
any
help
stood
on
the
green
and
saw
the
devouring
element
pass
from
room
to
room
till
their
ancient
dwelling
was
utterly
destroyed
fortunately
however
the
air
was
calm
and
the
escaping
the
ruinous
contagion
of
the
flames
there
was
still
a
beild
left
in
the
barn
to
which
they
could
retire
in
the
meantime
the
light
of
the
burning
spread
over
the
country
but
the
people
knowing
that
soldiers
were
quartered
in
ringlewood
stood
aloof
in
the
dread
of
firearms
thinking
the
conflagration
might
be
caused
by
some
contest
of
war
so
that
the
mansion
of
a
gentleman
much
beloved
of
all
his
neighbours
was
allowed
to
burn
to
the
ground
before
their
eyes
without
any
one
venturing
to
come
to
help
him
to
so
great
a
degree
had
distrust
and
the
outrages
of
military
riot
at
that
epoch
altered
the
hearts
of
men
my
brother
and
esau
wardrop
staid
with
ringlewood
till
the
morning
and
had
for
the
space
of
three
or
four
hours
a
restoring
sleep
fain
would
they
have
remained
longer
there
but
the
threat
of
the
soldiers
to
accuse
them
as
the
incendiaries
made
ringlewood
urge
them
to
depart
saying
that
maybe
a
time
would
come
when
it
would
be
in
his
power
to
thank
them
for
their
help
in
that
dreadful
night
but
he
was
not
long
exposed
to
many
sufferings
for
the
leddy
on
the
day
following
as
in
we
heard
was
seized
with
her
and
departed
this
life
in
the
course
of
three
days
and
the
laird
also
in
less
than
a
month
was
laid
in
the
with
his
ancestors
by
her
side
chapter
lxvi
after
leaving
ringlewood
the
two
fugitives
by
divers
journeyings
and
sore
passages
through
moss
and
moor
crossed
the
balloch
ferry
and
coming
down
the
north
side
of
the
clyde
frith
to
ardmore
they
boated
across
to
greenock
where
in
little
more
than
an
hour
after
their
arrival
they
were
taken
in
euphan
blair
public
in
cartsdyke
and
the
same
night
marched
off
to
glasgow
of
all
which
i
have
already
given
intimation
in
recording
my
own
trials
at
inverkip
but
in
that
march
as
my
brother
and
esau
wardrop
were
passing
with
their
guard
at
the
inchinnan
ferry
the
soldiers
heedlessly
laying
their
firelocks
all
in
a
heap
in
the
boat
the
thought
came
into
my
head
that
maybe
it
might
be
turned
to
an
advantage
if
he
was
to
spoil
the
powder
in
the
firelocks
so
as
they
were
sitting
in
the
boat
he
with
seeming
innocence
drew
his
hand
several
times
through
the
water
and
in
lifting
it
took
care
to
drop
and
sprinkle
the
of
the
firelocks
in
so
much
that
by
the
time
they
were
ferried
to
the
renfrew
side
they
were
spoiled
for
immediate
use
do
as
i
do
said
he
softly
to
esau
wardrop
as
they
were
stepping
out
and
with
that
he
feigned
some
small
expedient
for
tarrying
in
the
boat
while
the
soldiers
taking
their
arms
leapt
on
shore
the
ferryman
also
was
out
before
them
and
my
brother
seeing
this
took
up
an
oar
seemingly
to
help
him
to
step
out
but
pretending
at
the
time
to
stumble
he
caught
hold
of
esau
shoulder
and
pushing
with
the
oar
shoved
off
the
boat
in
such
a
manner
that
the
rope
was
pulled
out
of
the
ferryman
hand
who
was
in
a
great
consternation
the
soldiers
however
laughed
at
seeing
how
the
river
current
was
carrying
away
their
prisoners
for
my
brother
was
in
no
hurry
to
make
use
of
the
oar
to
pull
the
boat
back
on
the
contrary
he
pushed
her
farther
and
farther
into
the
river
until
one
of
the
guards
beginning
to
suspect
some
stratagem
levelled
his
firelock
and
threatened
to
shoot
whereupon
my
brother
and
esau
quickened
their
exertions
and
soon
reached
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
while
the
soldiers
were
banning
and
tearing
with
rage
to
be
so
outwitted
and
their
firelocks
rendered
useless
for
the
time
as
soon
as
the
fugitives
were
within
wadeable
reach
of
the
bank
they
jumpit
out
of
the
boat
and
ran
and
were
not
long
within
the
scope
of
their
adversaries
fire
by
this
time
the
sun
was
far
in
the
west
and
they
knew
little
of
the
country
about
where
they
were
but
before
embarking
the
ferryman
had
pointed
out
to
them
the
abbey
towers
of
paisley
and
they
knew
that
for
a
long
period
many
of
the
humane
inhabitants
of
that
town
had
been
among
the
faithfullest
of
scottishmen
to
the
cause
of
the
kirk
and
covenant
and
therefore
they
thought
that
under
the
distraction
of
their
circumstances
maybe
it
would
be
their
wisest
course
to
direct
their
steps
in
the
dusk
of
evening
towards
the
town
and
they
threw
aside
their
arms
that
they
might
pass
as
simple
wayfaring
men
accordingly
having
loitered
in
the
way
thither
they
reached
paisley
about
the
heel
of
the
twilight
and
searching
their
way
into
the
heart
of
the
town
they
found
a
respectable
public
near
the
cross
into
which
they
entered
and
ordered
some
consideration
of
vivers
for
supper
just
as
if
they
had
been
on
market
business
in
so
doing
nothing
particular
was
remarked
of
them
and
my
brother
by
way
of
an
entertainment
before
told
his
companion
of
my
grandfather
adventure
in
paisley
the
circumstantials
whereof
are
already
written
in
this
book
drawing
out
of
what
had
come
to
pass
with
him
cheering
aspirations
of
happier
days
for
themselves
while
they
were
thus
speaking
one
of
the
deacon
fulton
came
in
to
have
a
cap
and
a
crack
with
any
stranger
that
might
be
in
the
house
this
deacon
was
a
man
who
well
represented
and
was
a
good
swatch
of
the
plain
honesty
and
strict
principles
which
have
long
governed
within
that
ancient
borough
of
regality
he
seeing
them
and
being
withal
a
man
of
shrewd
discernment
eyed
them
very
sharply
and
maybe
guessing
what
they
were
and
where
they
had
come
from
entered
into
a
discreet
conversation
with
them
anent
the
troubles
of
the
time
in
this
he
showed
the
pawkrie
that
so
well
becomes
those
who
sit
in
council
with
a
spicerie
of
that
wholesome
virtue
and
friendly
sympathy
of
which
all
the
poor
fugitives
from
the
pentland
raid
stood
in
so
great
need
for
without
pretending
to
jealouse
any
thing
of
what
they
were
he
spoke
of
that
business
as
the
crack
of
the
day
and
told
them
of
many
of
the
afflicting
things
which
had
been
perpetrated
after
the
dispersion
of
the
covenanters
saying
it
a
thing
to
be
deplored
in
all
time
coming
that
the
poor
misguided
folk
concer
in
that
rash
wark
didna
rather
take
refuge
in
the
towns
and
amang
their
brethren
and
than
flee
to
the
hills
where
they
are
hunted
down
wi
dog
and
gun
as
beasts
o
an
ill
kind
really
every
body
wae
for
their
folly
though
to
be
sure
in
a
government
sense
their
fault
past
pardon
it
no
indeed
a
thing
toleration
that
subjects
are
to
rise
against
rulers
true
said
my
brother
unless
rulers
fall
against
subjects
the
worthy
magistrate
looked
a
thought
seriously
at
him
no
in
reproof
for
what
he
had
said
or
might
say
but
in
an
admonitory
manner
saying
ye
owre
douce
a
like
man
i
think
to
hae
been
either
art
or
part
in
this
headstrong
reformation
unless
ye
had
some
great
cause
to
provoke
you
and
i
doubt
na
ye
hae
discretion
enough
no
to
contest
without
need
points
o
doctrine
at
least
for
me
i
laith
to
enter
on
ony
sort
polemtic
for
it
a
gude
truth
i
nae
deacon
at
it
my
brother
discerning
by
his
manner
that
he
saw
through
them
would
have
refrai
at
the
time
from
further
discourse
but
esau
wardrop
was
though
a
man
of
few
words
yet
of
such
austerity
of
faith
that
he
could
not
abide
to
have
it
thought
he
was
in
any
time
or
place
afraid
for
himself
to
bear
his
testimony
even
when
manifestly
uncalled
on
to
do
so
he
here
broke
in
upon
the
considerate
and
worthy
counsellor
and
said
that
a
covenanted
spirit
was
bound
at
a
times
and
in
a
situations
conditions
and
circumstances
to
uphold
the
cause
true
true
we
are
a
covenanters
replied
the
deacon
and
gude
forbid
that
i
should
forget
the
vows
i
took
when
i
was
in
a
manner
a
bairn
but
there
an
unco
difference
between
the
auld
covenanting
and
this
lanerk
in
the
auld
times
our
forbears
and
our
fathers
covenanted
to
show
their
power
that
the
king
and
government
might
consider
what
they
were
doing
and
they
betook
not
themselves
to
the
sword
till
the
quiet
warning
of
almost
all
the
realm
united
in
one
league
had
proved
ineffectual
and
when
at
last
there
was
nae
help
and
they
were
called
by
their
conscience
and
dangers
to
gird
themselves
for
battle
they
went
forth
in
the
might
and
power
of
the
arm
of
flesh
as
weel
as
of
a
righteous
cause
but
sirs
this
donsie
business
of
the
pentland
raid
was
but
a
splurt
and
the
publishing
of
the
covenant
after
the
poor
folk
had
made
themselves
rebels
was
to
say
the
least
a
weak
conceit
we
were
not
rebels
cried
esau
wardrop
hoot
toot
friend
said
the
counsellor
ye
owre
hasty
i
did
na
ca
the
poor
folk
rebels
in
the
sense
of
a
rebellion
where
might
takes
the
lead
in
a
controversy
wi
right
but
because
they
had
risen
against
the
law
there
can
be
nae
rebellion
against
a
law
that
teaches
things
over
which
man
can
have
no
control
the
thought
and
the
conscience
said
esau
wardrop
aye
aye
replied
the
counsellor
a
that
vera
true
but
if
it
please
the
wisdom
of
the
king
by
and
with
the
advice
of
his
privy
counsellors
to
prohibit
certain
actions
and
surely
actions
are
neither
thoughts
nor
consciences
do
ye
mean
to
say
that
the
no
bound
to
obey
such
royal
ordinances
aye
if
the
acts
are
in
themselves
harmless
and
trench
not
upon
any
man
rights
of
property
and
person
weel
i
no
debate
that
wi
you
replied
the
worthy
counsellor
but
surely
ye
maintain
that
conventicles
and
the
desertion
of
the
regular
and
appointed
places
of
worship
are
harmless
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
sic
things
do
not
tend
to
aggrieve
and
impair
the
clergy
baith
in
their
minds
and
means
i
confess
that
said
esau
but
think
that
the
conventicles
and
desertions
whereof
ye
speak
sprang
out
of
an
arbitrary
and
disturbance
of
the
peaceful
worship
of
god
evil
counselling
caused
them
and
evil
counselling
punishes
them
till
the
punishment
can
be
no
longer
endured
ye
a
man
said
deacon
fulton
and
really
ye
hae
me
sic
a
cast
o
your
knowledge
that
i
can
do
no
less
than
make
you
a
return
so
tak
this
and
bide
nae
langer
in
paisley
than
your
needs
call
with
that
he
laid
his
purse
on
the
table
and
went
away
but
scarcely
had
he
departed
the
house
when
who
should
enter
but
the
very
soldiers
from
whom
my
brother
and
esau
had
so
marvellously
escaped
chapter
lxvii
the
noise
of
taking
up
my
brother
and
esau
wardrop
to
the
tolbooth
by
the
soldiers
bred
a
great
wonderment
in
the
town
and
the
magistrates
came
into
the
prison
to
see
them
then
it
was
that
they
recognised
their
friendly
adviser
among
those
in
authority
but
he
signified
by
winking
to
them
that
they
should
not
know
him
to
which
they
comported
themselves
so
that
it
passed
as
he
could
have
wished
provost
said
he
to
the
chief
magistrate
who
was
then
present
with
them
though
thir
honest
men
be
concerned
in
a
fret
against
the
government
they
no
just
iniquitous
malefactors
and
therefore
it
behoves
us
for
the
little
time
they
are
to
bide
here
to
deal
compassionately
with
them
this
is
a
damp
and
cauld
place
i
sure
we
might
them
the
use
of
the
and
direk
a
bit
spunk
fire
to
be
it
ye
ken
but
for
this
night
they
are
to
be
in
our
aught
and
their
crime
ye
ken
provost
was
mair
o
the
judgment
than
the
heart
and
therefore
we
should
think
how
we
are
a
prone
to
do
evil
by
this
sort
of
petitionary
exhorting
that
worthy
man
carried
his
point
and
the
provost
consented
that
the
prisoners
should
be
removed
to
the
where
he
directed
a
fire
to
be
lighted
for
their
solace
noo
honest
men
said
their
friend
the
deacon
when
he
was
taking
leave
of
them
after
seeing
them
in
the
i
hope
make
yoursels
as
comfortable
as
men
in
your
situation
can
reasonably
be
and
look
ye
said
he
to
my
brother
if
the
wind
should
rise
and
the
smoke
no
vent
sae
weel
as
ye
could
wis
which
is
sometimes
the
case
in
blowy
weather
when
the
door
shut
just
open
a
wee
bit
jinkie
o
this
window
and
he
gave
him
a
squeeze
on
the
arm
it
looks
into
my
yard
heh
but
it
weel
mindet
the
bar
on
my
in
the
want
reparation
i
maun
see
the
morn
there
was
no
difficulty
in
reading
the
whumplet
meaning
of
this
couthiness
anent
the
reeking
o
the
chamber
and
my
brother
and
esau
when
the
door
was
locket
on
them
for
the
night
soon
found
it
expedient
to
open
the
window
and
next
morning
the
kind
counsellor
had
more
occasion
than
ever
to
get
the
bar
o
his
repaired
for
it
had
yielded
to
the
grip
of
the
prisoners
who
long
afore
day
were
far
beyond
the
eye
and
jurisdiction
of
the
magistrates
of
paisley
they
took
the
straight
road
to
kilmarnock
intending
if
possible
to
hide
themselves
among
some
of
my
brother
jacob
wife
friends
in
that
town
he
had
himself
been
dead
some
short
time
before
but
in
the
course
of
their
journey
in
eschewing
the
as
much
as
possible
they
found
a
good
friend
in
a
cottar
who
lived
on
the
edge
of
the
mearns
moor
and
with
him
they
were
persuaded
to
bide
till
the
day
of
that
night
when
we
met
in
so
remarkable
a
manner
on
the
sands
of
ardrossan
and
the
cause
that
brought
him
there
was
one
of
the
severest
trials
to
which
he
had
yet
been
exposed
as
i
shall
now
rehearse
james
greig
the
kind
cottar
who
sheltered
them
for
the
better
part
of
three
weeks
was
but
a
poor
man
and
two
additional
inmates
consumed
the
meal
which
he
had
laid
in
for
himself
and
his
wife
so
that
he
was
obligated
to
apply
twice
for
the
loan
of
some
from
a
neighbour
which
caused
a
suspicion
to
arise
in
that
neighbour
mind
and
he
being
and
a
talking
man
let
out
what
he
thought
in
a
public
at
kilmarnock
in
presence
of
some
one
connected
with
the
soldiers
then
quartered
in
the
a
party
in
consequence
had
that
morning
been
sent
out
to
search
for
them
but
the
thoughtless
man
who
had
done
the
ill
was
seized
with
a
remorse
of
conscience
for
his
folly
and
came
in
time
to
advise
them
to
flee
but
not
so
much
in
time
as
to
prevent
them
from
being
seen
by
the
soldiers
who
no
sooner
discovered
them
than
they
pursued
them
what
became
of
esau
wardrop
was
never
known
he
was
no
doubt
shot
in
his
flight
but
my
brother
was
more
fortunate
for
he
kept
so
far
before
those
who
in
particular
pursued
him
that
although
they
kept
him
in
view
they
could
not
overtake
him
running
in
this
way
for
life
and
liberty
he
came
to
a
house
on
the
inhabited
by
a
lanerly
woman
and
the
door
being
open
he
darted
in
passing
through
to
the
yard
behind
where
he
found
himself
in
an
enclosed
place
out
of
which
he
saw
no
other
means
of
escape
but
through
a
ditch
full
of
water
the
depth
of
it
at
the
time
he
did
not
think
of
but
plunging
in
he
found
himself
up
to
the
chin
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
soldiers
at
hand
so
the
thought
struck
him
to
remain
where
he
was
and
to
go
under
a
that
overhung
the
water
by
this
means
he
was
so
effectually
concealed
that
the
soldiers
losing
sight
of
him
wreaked
their
anger
and
disappointment
on
the
poor
woman
dragging
her
with
them
to
the
where
they
threw
her
into
the
dungeon
in
the
darkness
of
which
she
perished
as
was
afterwards
well
known
through
all
that
after
escaping
from
the
ditch
my
brother
turned
his
course
more
northerly
and
had
closed
his
day
of
suffering
on
where
drawn
by
his
affections
to
seek
some
knowledge
of
his
wife
and
daughter
he
had
resolved
to
risk
himself
as
near
as
possible
to
quharist
that
night
and
coming
along
with
the
shower
on
his
back
which
blew
so
strong
in
our
faces
he
saw
us
by
the
glimpses
of
the
tempestuous
moonlight
as
we
were
approaching
and
had
denned
himself
on
the
till
we
should
pass
being
fearful
we
might
prove
enemies
some
accidental
lament
or
complaint
uttered
unconsciously
by
me
made
him
however
think
he
knew
the
voice
and
moved
thereby
he
started
up
and
had
just
joined
us
when
he
was
discovered
in
so
awakening
a
manner
thus
came
my
brother
and
i
to
meet
after
the
raid
of
pentland
and
having
heard
from
me
all
that
he
could
reasonably
hope
for
regarding
the
most
valued
casket
of
his
affections
he
came
along
with
mr
witherspoon
and
we
were
next
morning
safely
ferried
over
into
the
wee
cumbrae
by
james
plowter
the
ferryman
to
whom
we
were
both
well
known
there
was
then
only
a
herd
house
on
the
island
but
there
could
be
no
truer
or
kinder
christians
than
the
herd
and
his
wife
we
staid
with
them
till
far
in
the
year
hearing
often
through
james
plowter
of
our
friends
and
above
all
the
joyous
news
in
little
more
than
a
week
after
our
landing
of
sarah
lochrig
having
been
permitted
to
leave
the
tolbooth
of
irvine
without
further
dule
than
a
reproof
from
provost
reid
that
had
more
in
it
of
commendation
than
reproach
chapter
lxviii
it
is
well
set
forth
in
all
the
various
histories
of
this
dismal
epoch
that
the
cry
of
blood
had
gone
so
vehemently
up
to
heaven
from
the
graves
of
the
martyred
covenanters
that
the
lord
moved
the
heart
of
charles
stuart
to
more
merciful
measures
but
only
for
a
season
the
apostate
james
sharp
and
the
other
counsellors
whose
weakness
or
wickedness
fell
in
with
his
tyrannical
proselytising
purposes
were
wised
from
the
rule
of
power
and
the
earls
of
tweeddale
and
kincardine
with
that
learned
sage
and
philosopher
sir
john
murray
men
of
more
beneficent
dispositions
were
appointed
to
sit
in
their
places
in
the
privy
council
at
edinburgh
so
that
all
in
our
condition
were
heartened
to
return
to
their
homes
as
soon
as
we
heard
that
the
ravenous
soldiery
were
withdrawn
from
the
shire
of
ayr
my
brother
and
i
with
mr
witherspoon
after
an
abode
of
more
than
seven
months
in
yon
solitary
and
rocky
islet
returned
to
quharist
but
o
courteous
reader
i
dare
not
venture
to
tell
of
the
joy
of
the
meeting
and
the
fond
intermingling
of
embraces
that
was
too
great
a
reward
for
all
our
sufferings
for
now
i
approach
the
memorials
of
those
things
by
which
the
terrible
heavens
have
manifested
that
i
was
ordained
from
the
beginning
to
launch
the
bolt
that
was
chosen
from
the
quiver
in
the
armoury
of
the
almighty
avenger
to
overthrow
the
oppressor
and
oppression
of
my
native
land
it
is
therefore
enough
to
state
that
upon
my
return
home
where
i
expected
to
find
my
lands
waste
and
my
fences
broken
down
i
found
all
things
in
better
order
than
they
maybe
would
have
been
had
the
eye
of
the
master
been
over
them
for
our
kind
neighbours
out
of
a
friendly
consideration
for
my
family
had
in
the
spring
tilled
the
ground
and
sown
the
seed
by
labour
and
surely
it
was
a
pleasant
thing
in
the
midst
of
such
a
general
depravity
of
the
human
heart
so
prevalent
at
that
period
to
hear
of
such
constancy
and
for
it
was
not
towards
my
brother
and
me
only
that
such
things
were
done
the
same
was
common
throughout
the
country
towards
the
lands
and
families
of
the
persecuted
but
the
lown
of
that
time
was
as
a
pet
day
in
winter
in
the
harvest
however
when
the
proposal
came
out
that
we
should
give
bonds
to
keep
the
peace
i
made
no
scruple
of
signing
the
same
and
of
getting
my
wife
father
who
was
not
out
in
the
raid
to
be
my
cautioner
in
the
doing
of
this
i
did
not
renounce
the
covenant
but
on
the
contrary
i
considered
that
by
the
bonds
the
king
was
as
much
bound
to
preserve
things
in
the
state
under
which
i
granted
the
bond
as
i
was
to
remain
in
the
quiet
condition
i
was
when
i
signed
it
after
the
bonds
of
peace
came
the
indulgence
and
the
chief
heritors
of
our
parish
having
something
to
say
with
the
lord
tweeddale
leave
was
obtained
for
mr
swinton
to
come
back
and
we
had
made
a
paction
with
andrew
dornock
the
prelatic
curate
and
incumbent
to
let
him
have
his
manse
again
but
although
mr
swinton
did
return
and
his
family
were
again
gathered
around
him
he
would
not
as
he
said
himself
to
me
so
far
bow
the
knee
to
baal
as
to
bring
the
church
of
christ
in
any
measure
or
way
into
erastian
dependence
on
the
civil
magistrate
so
he
neither
would
return
to
the
manse
nor
enter
the
pulpit
but
continued
for
the
space
of
several
years
to
reside
at
quharist
and
to
preach
on
the
summer
sundays
from
the
window
in
the
gable
in
the
spring
however
of
the
year
he
after
a
lingering
illness
closed
his
life
and
ministry
for
some
time
he
had
felt
himself
going
hence
and
the
tenour
of
his
prayers
and
sermons
had
for
several
months
been
of
a
high
and
searching
efficacy
and
he
never
failed
sabbath
after
sabbath
just
before
pronouncing
the
blessing
to
return
public
thanks
that
the
lord
was
drawing
him
so
softly
away
from
the
world
and
from
the
storms
that
were
gathering
in
the
black
cloud
of
prelacy
which
still
overhung
and
darkened
the
ministry
of
the
kirk
of
scotland
a
method
of
admonition
that
was
awfully
awakening
to
the
souls
of
his
hearers
and
treasured
by
them
as
a
solemn
breathing
of
the
inspiration
of
prophecy
when
he
was
laid
in
the
earth
and
mr
witherspoon
by
some
handling
on
my
part
was
invited
to
fill
the
void
which
his
removal
had
left
among
us
the
wind
again
began
to
fisle
and
the
signs
of
a
tempest
were
seen
in
the
changes
of
the
royal
councils
the
statesmen
before
spoken
of
were
removed
from
their
benignant
spheres
like
falling
stars
from
the
firmament
and
the
duke
of
lauderdale
was
endowed
with
the
power
to
persecute
and
domineer
scarcely
was
he
seated
in
the
council
when
the
edicts
of
oppression
were
renewed
the
prelates
became
clamorous
for
his
interference
and
the
penalties
of
the
bonds
of
peace
presented
the
means
of
supplying
the
inordinate
wants
of
his
rapacious
wife
steps
were
accordingly
soon
taken
to
appease
and
pleasure
both
the
crime
of
hearing
the
gospel
preached
in
the
fields
as
it
was
by
john
in
the
wilderness
and
jesus
on
the
mount
was
again
prohibited
with
new
rigour
and
i
for
one
soon
felt
that
in
the
renewed
persecution
of
those
who
attended
the
conventicles
the
king
had
again
as
much
broken
the
conditions
under
which
i
gave
the
bond
of
peace
as
he
had
before
broken
the
vows
of
the
solemn
league
and
covenant
so
that
when
the
guilty
project
was
ripened
in
his
bloody
councils
that
the
west
country
should
be
again
exasperated
into
rebellion
that
a
reason
might
be
procured
for
keeping
up
a
standing
army
in
order
that
the
three
kingdoms
might
be
ruled
by
prerogative
instead
of
parliament
i
freely
confess
that
i
was
one
of
those
who
did
refuse
to
sign
the
bonds
that
were
devised
to
provoke
the
rebellion
bonds
the
terms
whereof
sufficiently
manifested
the
purpose
that
governed
the
framers
in
the
framing
we
were
required
by
them
under
severe
penalties
to
undertake
that
neither
our
families
nor
our
servants
nor
our
tenants
nor
the
servants
of
our
tenants
nor
any
others
residing
upon
our
lands
should
withdraw
from
the
churches
or
adhere
to
conventicles
or
succour
field
preachers
or
persons
who
had
incurred
the
penalties
attached
to
these
offences
and
because
we
refused
to
sign
these
bonds
and
continued
to
worship
god
in
the
peacefulness
of
the
gospel
the
whole
country
was
treated
by
the
duke
of
lauderdale
as
in
a
state
of
revolt
the
english
forces
came
mustering
against
us
on
the
borders
the
irish
garrisons
were
drawn
to
the
coast
to
invade
us
and
the
lawless
highlanders
were
tempted
by
their
need
and
greed
and
a
royal
promise
of
indemnity
for
whatsoever
outrages
they
might
commit
to
come
down
upon
us
in
all
their
fury
by
these
means
ten
thousand
ruthless
soldiers
and
unreclaimed
barbarians
were
let
loose
upon
us
while
we
were
sitting
in
the
sun
listening
i
may
say
truly
to
those
gracious
counsellings
which
breathe
nothing
but
peace
and
when
since
the
burning
days
of
dioclesian
the
roman
emperor
when
since
the
massacre
of
the
protestants
by
orders
of
the
french
king
on
the
eve
of
st
bartholomew
was
so
black
a
crime
ever
perpetrated
by
a
guilty
government
on
its
own
subjects
but
i
was
myself
among
the
greatest
of
the
sufferers
and
it
is
needful
that
i
should
now
clothe
my
thoughts
with
sobriety
and
restrain
the
ire
of
the
pen
of
grief
and
not
revenge
no
let
the
word
be
here
justice
the
highland
host
came
on
us
in
want
and
but
for
their
license
to
destroy
in
beggary
yet
when
they
returned
to
their
wild
homes
among
the
distant
hills
they
were
laden
as
with
the
household
wealth
of
a
realm
in
so
much
that
they
were
rendered
defenceless
by
the
weight
of
their
spoil
at
the
bridge
of
glasgow
the
students
of
the
college
and
the
other
brave
youths
of
that
town
looking
on
them
with
true
scottish
hearts
and
wrathful
to
see
that
the
barbarians
had
been
such
robbers
of
their
stopped
above
two
thousand
of
them
and
took
from
them
their
congregations
of
goods
and
wares
wearing
apparel
pots
pans
and
gridirons
and
other
furniture
wherewith
they
had
burdened
themselves
like
bearers
at
a
flitting
my
house
was
stript
to
a
wastage
and
every
thing
was
taken
away
what
was
too
heavy
to
be
easily
transported
was
after
being
carried
some
distance
left
on
the
road
the
very
shoes
were
taken
off
my
wife
feet
and
ye
no
be
a
refuse
to
me
that
said
a
reprobate
as
he
took
hold
of
sarah
lochrig
hand
and
robbed
her
of
her
i
was
present
and
saw
the
deed
i
felt
my
hands
clench
but
in
my
spirit
i
discovered
that
it
was
then
the
hour
of
outrage
and
that
the
avenger
time
was
not
yet
come
chapter
lxix
rarely
has
it
fallen
to
the
lot
of
man
to
be
so
blessed
with
such
children
as
mine
but
surely
i
was
unworthy
of
the
blessing
and
yet
though
maybe
unworthy
lord
thou
knowest
by
the
nightly
anthems
of
thankfulness
that
rose
from
my
hearth
that
the
chief
sentiment
in
my
breast
in
those
moments
of
melody
was
my
inward
acknowledgment
to
thee
for
having
made
this
world
so
bright
to
me
with
an
offspring
so
good
and
fair
and
with
sarah
lochrig
their
mother
she
whose
life
was
the
sweetness
in
the
cup
of
my
felicity
let
me
not
however
hurry
on
nor
forget
that
i
am
but
an
historian
and
that
it
befits
not
the
juridical
pen
of
the
character
to
dwell
upon
my
own
woes
when
i
have
to
tell
of
the
sufferings
of
others
the
trials
and
the
tribulations
which
i
had
heard
so
much
of
and
whereof
i
had
witnessed
so
many
made
me
in
a
sense
but
little
liable
to
be
moved
when
told
of
any
new
outrage
but
the
sight
of
that
highlander
wrenching
from
sarah
lochrig
finger
our
did
in
its
effects
and
influences
cause
a
change
in
my
nature
as
sudden
and
as
wonderful
as
that
which
the
rod
of
moses
underwent
in
being
quickened
into
a
serpent
for
some
time
i
sat
as
i
was
sitting
while
the
deed
was
doing
and
when
my
wife
after
the
plunderers
had
departed
said
to
me
soothingly
that
we
had
reason
to
be
thankful
for
having
endured
no
other
loss
than
a
little
world
gear
she
was
surprised
at
the
sedateness
with
which
i
responded
to
her
pious
condolements
michael
our
then
in
the
prime
beauty
of
his
manhood
had
been
absent
when
the
robbery
was
committed
and
coming
in
on
hearing
what
had
been
done
flamed
with
the
generous
rage
of
youth
and
marvelled
that
i
had
been
so
calm
my
blithe
and
blooming
mary
joined
her
ingenuous
admiration
to
theirs
but
my
mild
and
sensible
margaret
fell
upon
my
neck
and
weeping
cried
o
father
it
no
worth
the
doure
thought
that
gars
your
brows
sae
gloom
while
joseph
the
youngest
of
the
flock
then
in
his
twelfth
year
brought
the
bible
and
laid
it
on
my
knees
i
opened
the
book
and
would
have
read
a
portion
but
the
passage
which
caught
my
eye
was
the
beginning
of
the
sixth
chapter
of
jeremiah
o
ye
children
of
benjamin
gather
yourselves
to
flee
out
of
the
midst
of
jerusalem
and
blow
the
trumpet
in
tekoa
and
set
up
a
sign
of
fire
in
for
evil
appeareth
out
of
the
north
and
great
destruction
and
i
thought
it
was
a
voice
calling
me
to
arm
and
to
raise
the
banner
against
the
oppressor
and
thereupon
i
shut
the
book
and
retiring
to
the
fields
communed
with
myself
for
some
time
having
returned
into
the
house
and
sent
michael
to
my
brother
to
inquire
how
it
had
fared
with
him
and
his
family
i
at
the
same
time
directed
joseph
to
go
to
irvine
and
tell
our
friends
there
to
help
us
with
a
supply
of
blankets
for
the
highlanders
had
taken
away
my
horses
and
driven
off
my
cattle
and
we
had
no
means
of
bringing
any
thing
but
joseph
was
not
long
gone
when
michael
came
flying
back
from
my
brother
and
i
saw
by
his
looks
that
something
very
dreadful
had
been
committed
and
said
are
they
all
in
life
aye
in
life
and
the
tears
rushing
into
his
eyes
he
exclaimed
but
o
i
wish
that
my
cousin
bell
had
been
dead
and
buried
bell
gilhaize
my
brother
only
daughter
was
the
maiden
in
all
our
parish
it
had
long
been
a
pleasure
both
to
her
father
and
me
to
observe
a
mingling
of
affections
between
her
and
michael
and
the
year
following
had
been
fixt
for
their
marriage
the
time
of
weeping
michael
said
i
is
past
and
the
time
of
warring
will
soon
come
it
is
not
in
man
to
bear
always
aggression
nor
can
it
be
required
of
him
ever
to
endure
contumely
what
has
befallen
bell
said
his
mother
to
him
but
instead
of
making
her
any
answer
he
uttered
a
dreadful
sound
like
the
howl
of
madness
and
hastily
quitted
the
house
sarah
lochrig
who
was
a
woman
of
a
serene
reason
and
mild
and
gracious
in
her
nature
looked
at
me
with
a
silent
sadness
that
told
all
the
anguish
with
which
the
horror
that
she
guessed
had
darted
into
her
soul
and
then
with
an
energy
that
i
never
saw
in
her
before
folded
her
own
two
daughters
to
her
bosom
as
if
she
was
in
terror
for
them
and
bathed
their
necks
with
tears
while
we
were
in
this
state
my
brother
himself
came
in
he
was
now
a
man
well
stricken
in
years
but
of
a
hale
appearance
and
usually
of
an
open
and
manly
countenance
nor
on
this
occasion
did
he
appear
greatly
altered
but
there
was
a
fire
in
his
eye
and
a
severity
in
his
aspect
such
as
i
never
seen
before
yet
withal
a
fortitude
that
showed
how
strong
the
was
which
kept
the
tempest
within
him
from
breaking
out
in
word
or
gesture
ringan
said
he
we
have
met
with
a
misfortune
it
the
will
of
providence
and
we
maun
bear
it
but
surely
in
the
anger
that
is
caused
by
provocation
our
creator
tells
us
to
resent
from
this
hour
all
obligation
obedience
allegiance
all
whatsoever
that
as
a
subject
i
did
owe
to
charles
stuart
is
at
an
end
i
am
his
foe
and
the
lord
put
strength
into
my
arm
to
revenge
the
ruin
of
my
bairn
there
was
in
the
utterance
of
these
words
a
solemnity
at
first
terrifying
to
hear
but
his
voice
in
the
last
clause
of
the
sentence
faltered
and
he
took
off
his
bonnet
and
held
it
over
his
face
and
wept
bitterly
i
could
make
him
no
answer
for
some
time
but
i
took
hold
of
his
hand
and
when
he
had
a
little
mastered
his
grief
i
said
brother
we
are
children
of
the
same
parents
and
the
wrongs
of
one
are
the
wrongs
of
both
but
let
us
not
be
hasty
he
took
the
bonnet
from
his
face
and
looked
at
me
sternly
for
a
little
while
and
then
he
said
ringan
gilhaize
till
you
have
felt
what
i
feel
you
can
know
that
the
speed
o
lightning
is
slow
to
the
wishes
and
the
will
of
revenge
at
that
moment
his
daughter
bell
was
brought
in
led
by
my
son
michael
her
father
at
the
sight
of
her
clasped
his
hands
wildly
above
his
head
and
rushed
out
of
the
house
my
wife
went
towards
her
but
stopped
and
fell
back
into
my
arms
at
the
sight
of
her
demented
look
my
daughters
gazed
and
held
up
their
trembling
hands
speak
to
her
said
michael
to
his
sisters
she
maybe
heed
you
and
he
added
bell
it
mary
and
peggy
and
dropping
her
hand
he
went
to
lead
mary
to
her
while
she
stood
like
a
statue
on
the
spot
dear
bell
said
i
as
i
moved
myself
gently
from
the
arms
of
my
afflicted
wife
come
wi
me
to
the
open
air
and
i
took
her
by
the
hand
which
poor
michael
had
dropped
and
led
her
out
to
the
green
but
still
she
looked
the
same
demented
creature
her
father
who
had
by
this
time
again
overcome
his
distress
seeing
us
on
the
green
came
towards
us
while
my
wife
and
daughters
also
came
out
but
michael
could
no
longer
endure
the
sight
of
the
rifled
rose
that
he
had
cherished
for
the
ornament
of
his
bosom
and
he
remained
to
hide
his
grief
in
the
house
her
mind
gone
ringan
said
my
brother
and
she
be
better
in
this
world
nor
was
she
but
she
lived
many
months
after
and
in
all
the
time
never
shed
a
tear
nor
breathed
a
sigh
nor
spoke
a
word
where
she
was
led
she
went
where
she
was
left
she
stood
at
last
she
became
so
weak
that
she
could
not
stand
and
one
day
as
i
was
sitting
at
her
bedside
i
observed
that
she
lay
unusually
still
and
touching
her
hand
found
that
all
her
sorrows
were
over
chapter
lxx
from
the
day
of
the
desolation
of
his
daughter
my
brother
seldom
held
any
communion
with
me
but
i
observed
that
with
michael
he
had
much
business
and
though
i
asked
no
questions
i
needed
not
to
be
told
that
there
was
a
judgment
and
a
doom
in
what
they
did
i
was
therefore
fearful
that
some
rash
step
would
be
taken
at
the
burial
of
bell
for
it
was
understood
that
all
the
neighbours
far
and
near
intended
to
be
present
to
testify
their
pity
for
her
fate
so
i
spoke
to
mr
witherspoon
concerning
my
fears
and
by
his
exhortations
the
body
was
borne
to
the
in
a
solemn
and
peaceable
manner
but
just
as
the
coffin
was
laid
in
the
grave
and
before
a
spadeful
of
earth
was
thrown
a
boy
came
running
crying
sharp
the
apostate
dead
which
made
every
one
turn
round
and
pause
and
while
we
were
thus
standing
a
horseman
came
riding
by
who
confirmed
the
tidings
that
a
band
of
men
whom
his
persecutions
had
made
desperate
had
executed
justice
on
the
apostate
as
he
was
travelling
in
his
carriage
with
his
daughter
on
while
the
stranger
was
telling
the
news
the
corpse
lay
in
the
grave
unburied
and
dreadful
to
tell
when
he
had
made
an
end
of
his
tale
there
was
a
shout
of
joy
and
exultation
set
up
by
all
present
except
by
michael
and
my
brother
they
stood
unmoved
and
i
thought
do
i
them
any
wrong
that
they
looked
disconsolate
and
disappointed
but
though
the
judgment
on
james
sharp
was
a
cause
of
satisfaction
to
all
covenanted
hearts
many
were
not
yet
so
torn
by
the
persecution
as
entirely
to
applaud
the
deed
i
shall
not
therefore
enter
upon
the
particulars
of
what
was
done
anent
those
who
dealt
his
doom
for
they
were
not
of
our
neighbourhood
the
crime
however
of
listening
peacefully
in
the
fields
to
the
truths
of
the
gospel
became
in
the
sight
of
the
persecutors
every
day
more
and
more
heinous
and
they
gave
themselves
up
to
the
tyranny
of
legal
ordinances
as
if
the
enactment
and
execution
of
bloody
laws
contrary
to
those
of
god
and
against
the
unoffending
privileges
of
our
nature
were
not
wickedness
of
as
dark
a
stain
as
the
use
of
his
secret
knife
edict
and
proclamation
against
and
conventicles
came
following
each
other
and
the
latest
was
the
fiercest
and
fellest
of
all
which
had
preceded
but
the
cause
of
truth
and
the
right
of
communion
with
the
lord
was
not
to
be
given
up
it
is
not
for
glory
we
said
in
the
words
of
those
brave
scottish
barons
that
redeemed
with
king
robert
the
bruce
their
native
land
from
the
thraldom
of
the
english
edward
nor
is
it
for
riches
neither
is
it
for
honour
but
it
is
for
liberty
alone
we
contend
which
no
true
man
will
lose
but
with
his
life
and
therefore
it
was
that
we
would
not
yield
obedience
to
the
tyranny
which
was
revived
with
new
strength
by
the
death
of
james
sharp
in
revenge
for
his
doom
but
sought
in
despite
of
decrees
and
statutes
to
hear
the
word
where
we
believed
it
was
best
spoken
the
laws
of
god
which
are
above
all
human
authority
require
that
we
should
worship
him
in
truth
and
in
holiness
and
we
resolved
to
do
so
to
the
uttermost
and
prepared
ourselves
with
arms
to
resist
whoever
might
be
sent
to
molest
us
in
the
performance
of
that
the
greatest
duty
but
in
so
exercising
the
divine
right
of
resistance
we
were
not
called
upon
to
harm
those
whom
we
knew
to
be
our
adversaries
belting
ourselves
for
defence
not
for
war
we
went
singly
to
our
places
of
secret
meeting
in
the
glens
and
on
the
moors
and
when
the
holy
exercise
was
done
we
returned
to
our
homes
as
peacefully
as
we
went
thither
many
a
time
i
have
since
thought
that
surely
in
no
other
age
or
land
was
ever
such
a
solemn
celebration
of
the
sabbath
as
in
those
days
the
very
dangers
with
which
we
were
environed
exalted
the
devout
heart
verily
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
see
the
fearless
religious
man
moving
from
his
house
in
the
grey
of
the
morning
with
the
bible
in
his
hand
and
his
sword
for
a
staff
walking
towards
the
hills
for
many
a
weary
mile
hoping
the
preacher
would
be
there
and
praying
as
he
went
that
there
might
be
no
molestation
often
and
often
on
those
occasions
has
the
lord
been
pleased
to
shelter
his
worshippers
from
their
persecutors
by
covering
them
with
the
mantle
of
his
tempest
and
many
a
time
at
the
dead
of
night
when
the
winds
were
soughing
around
and
the
moon
was
bowling
through
the
clouds
we
have
stood
on
the
heath
of
the
hills
and
the
sound
of
our
psalms
has
been
mingled
with
the
roaring
of
the
gathering
waters
the
calamities
which
drove
us
thus
to
worship
in
the
wilderness
and
amidst
the
storm
rose
to
their
full
tide
on
the
back
of
the
death
of
the
james
sharp
for
all
the
religious
people
in
the
realm
were
in
a
manner
regarded
by
the
government
as
participators
in
the
method
of
his
punishment
and
claverhouse
whom
i
have
now
to
speak
of
got
that
special
commission
on
which
he
rode
so
wickedly
to
put
to
the
sword
whomsoever
he
found
with
arms
at
any
preaching
in
the
fields
so
that
we
had
no
choice
in
seeking
to
obtain
the
consolations
of
religion
which
we
then
stood
so
much
in
need
of
but
to
congregate
in
such
numbers
as
would
deter
the
soldiers
from
venturing
to
attack
us
this
it
was
which
caused
the
second
rising
and
led
to
the
fatal
day
of
whereof
it
is
needful
that
i
should
particularly
speak
not
only
on
account
of
the
great
stress
that
was
thereon
laid
by
the
persecutors
in
making
out
of
it
a
method
of
fiery
ordeal
to
afflict
the
covenanted
but
also
because
it
was
the
overflowing
of
the
deluge
that
made
me
desolate
and
herein
courteous
reader
should
aught
of
a
fiercer
feeling
than
belongs
to
the
sacred
sternness
of
truth
and
justice
escape
from
my
historical
pen
thou
wilt
surely
pardon
the
same
if
there
be
any
of
the
gracious
ruth
of
christian
gentleness
in
thy
bosom
for
now
i
have
to
tell
of
things
that
have
made
the
annals
of
the
land
as
red
as
crimson
and
filled
my
house
with
the
blackness
of
ashes
and
universal
death
for
a
long
period
there
had
been
from
the
causes
and
circumstances
premised
sore
difficulties
in
the
assembling
of
congregations
and
the
sacrament
of
the
supper
had
not
been
dispensed
in
many
parts
of
the
shire
of
ayr
from
the
time
of
the
highland
host
so
that
there
was
a
great
longing
in
the
hearts
of
the
covenanted
to
partake
once
again
of
that
holy
refreshment
and
shortly
after
the
it
began
to
be
concerted
that
early
in
the
summer
a
day
should
be
set
apart
and
a
place
fixed
for
the
celebration
of
the
same
about
the
time
of
the
interment
of
my
brother
desolated
daughter
and
the
judgment
of
the
death
executed
on
james
sharp
it
was
settled
that
the
moors
of
should
be
the
place
of
meeting
and
that
the
first
sabbath
of
june
should
be
the
day
but
what
ministers
would
be
there
was
not
settled
for
who
could
tell
which
in
those
times
would
be
spared
from
prison
it
was
however
forethought
and
foreseen
that
the
assemblage
of
communicants
would
be
very
considerable
for
in
order
that
there
might
be
the
less
risk
of
molestation
a
wish
that
it
should
be
so
was
put
forth
among
us
to
the
end
that
the
king
forces
might
swither
to
disperse
us
accordingly
with
my
disconsolate
brother
and
son
i
went
to
be
present
at
that
congregation
and
we
carried
our
arms
with
us
as
we
were
then
in
the
habit
of
doing
on
all
occasions
of
public
testimony
by
worship
in
the
meantime
a
rent
had
been
made
in
the
covenant
partly
by
the
of
certain
young
preachers
who
not
feeling
as
we
did
that
the
duty
of
presbyterians
went
no
farther
than
defence
and
resistance
strove
with
all
the
pith
of
an
effectual
eloquence
to
exasperate
the
minds
of
their
hearers
into
hostility
against
those
in
authority
and
it
happened
that
several
of
those
who
had
executed
the
judgment
on
james
sharp
seeing
no
hope
of
pardon
for
what
they
had
done
leagued
themselves
with
this
party
in
the
hope
of
thereby
making
head
against
their
pursuers
i
have
been
the
more
strict
in
setting
down
these
circumstantials
because
in
the
bloody
afterings
of
that
meeting
they
were
altogether
lost
sight
of
and
also
because
the
implacable
rage
with
which
claverhouse
persecuted
the
covenanters
has
been
extenuated
by
some
discreet
historians
on
the
plea
of
his
being
an
honourable
officer
deduced
from
his
soldierly
worth
elsewhere
whereas
the
truth
is
that
his
cruelties
in
the
shire
of
ayr
and
other
of
our
western
parts
were
less
the
fruit
of
his
instructions
wide
and
severe
as
they
were
than
of
his
own
mortified
vanity
and
malignant
revenge
chapter
lxxi
it
was
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
on
saturday
the
last
day
of
may
when
my
brother
came
over
to
my
house
where
with
michael
i
had
prepared
myself
to
go
with
him
to
our
intent
was
to
walk
that
night
to
kilmarnock
and
abide
till
the
morning
with
our
brother
jacob
widow
not
having
seen
her
for
a
long
time
we
had
in
the
course
of
that
day
heard
something
of
the
publication
of
the
declaration
and
testimony
which
through
the
vehemence
of
the
preachers
before
spoken
of
had
been
rashly
counselled
at
ruglen
the
of
the
month
but
there
was
no
particulars
and
what
we
did
hear
was
like
as
all
such
things
are
greatly
magnified
beyond
the
truth
we
however
were
grieved
by
the
tidings
for
we
feared
some
cause
of
tribulation
would
be
thereby
engendered
detrimental
to
the
religious
purposes
of
our
journey
this
sentiment
pressing
heavily
on
our
hearts
we
parted
from
my
family
with
many
misgivings
and
the
bodements
of
further
sorrows
but
the
outward
expression
of
what
we
all
felt
was
the
less
remarkable
on
account
of
what
so
lately
had
before
happened
in
my
brother
house
nor
indeed
did
i
think
at
the
time
that
the
foretaste
of
what
was
ordained
so
speedily
to
come
to
a
head
was
at
all
so
lively
in
his
spirit
or
that
of
my
son
as
it
was
in
mine
till
in
passing
over
the
top
of
the
he
looked
round
on
the
lands
of
quharist
and
said
i
care
nae
ringan
if
i
come
back
for
though
we
hae
lang
dwelt
in
affection
together
thae
that
were
most
precious
to
me
are
now
both
aneath
the
sod
alluding
to
his
wife
who
had
been
several
years
dead
and
poor
bell
that
lovely
rose
which
the
ruthless
spoiler
had
so
trampled
into
the
earth
i
feel
said
michael
as
if
i
were
going
to
a
foreign
land
there
is
sic
a
farewell
sadness
upon
me
but
we
strove
to
overcome
this
and
walked
leisurely
on
the
high
road
towards
kilmarnock
trying
to
discourse
of
indifferent
things
and
as
the
gloaming
faded
and
the
night
began
to
look
forth
from
her
in
the
heavens
with
all
her
eyes
of
beautiful
light
we
communed
of
the
friends
that
we
trusted
were
in
glory
and
marvelled
if
it
could
be
that
they
saw
us
after
death
or
ever
revisited
the
persons
and
the
scenes
that
they
loved
in
life
rebellion
or
treason
or
any
sense
of
thoughts
and
things
that
were
not
holy
had
no
portion
in
our
conversation
we
were
going
to
celebrate
the
redemption
of
fallen
man
and
we
were
mourning
for
friends
no
more
our
discourse
was
of
eternal
things
and
the
mysteries
of
the
stars
and
the
lights
of
that
world
which
is
above
the
firmament
when
we
reached
kilmarnock
we
found
that
jacob
widow
had
with
several
other
godly
women
set
out
towards
the
place
of
meeting
to
sojourn
with
a
relation
that
night
in
order
that
they
might
be
the
abler
to
gather
the
manna
of
the
word
in
the
morning
we
therefore
resolved
not
to
halt
there
but
to
go
forward
to
the
appointed
place
and
rest
upon
the
spot
this
accordingly
doing
we
came
to
the
eastern
side
of
the
trysted
place
shortly
after
the
first
scad
of
the
dawn
many
were
there
before
us
both
men
and
women
and
little
children
and
horses
intermingled
some
slumbering
and
some
communing
with
one
another
and
as
the
morning
brightened
it
was
a
hallowed
sight
to
behold
from
that
rising
ground
the
blameless
persecuted
coming
with
sedate
steps
to
worship
their
maker
on
the
mountain
the
reverend
mr
thomas
douglas
who
was
to
open
the
action
arrived
about
the
rising
of
the
sun
with
several
other
ministers
and
behind
them
four
aged
men
belonging
to
strathaven
bearing
the
elements
a
pious
lady
whose
name
i
never
heard
owing
to
what
ensued
spread
with
her
own
hands
a
damask
tablecloth
on
the
ground
and
the
bread
and
wine
were
placed
upon
it
with
more
reverence
than
ever
was
in
kirk
mr
douglas
having
mounted
upon
a
rock
nigh
to
where
this
was
done
was
about
to
give
out
the
psalm
when
we
observed
several
country
lads
that
were
stationed
as
watchers
afar
off
coming
with
great
haste
in
and
they
brought
word
that
claverhouse
and
his
dragoons
were
coming
to
disperse
us
bringing
with
them
the
reverend
mr
king
a
preacher
of
the
gospel
at
hamilton
and
others
that
they
had
made
prisoners
tied
with
cords
two
and
two
the
tidings
for
a
moment
caused
panic
and
consternation
but
as
the
men
were
armed
and
resolved
to
resist
it
was
thought
in
consideration
of
the
women
and
children
that
we
ought
to
go
forward
and
prevent
the
adversaries
from
advancing
accordingly
to
the
number
of
forty
horsemen
and
maybe
near
to
two
hundred
foot
we
drew
ourselves
apart
from
the
congregation
and
marched
to
meet
claverhouse
thinking
perhaps
on
seeing
us
so
numerous
that
he
would
not
come
on
while
mr
douglas
proceeded
with
the
worship
the
piety
of
none
with
him
being
abated
by
this
grievous
visitation
mr
william
clelland
with
mr
hamilton
who
had
come
with
mr
douglas
were
our
leaders
and
we
met
claverhouse
on
the
moor
of
drumclog
the
dragoons
were
the
first
to
halt
and
claverhouse
having
ordered
his
prisoners
to
be
drawn
aside
was
the
first
who
gave
the
word
to
fire
this
was
without
any
parley
or
request
to
know
whether
we
came
with
hostile
intent
or
no
clelland
on
seeing
the
dragoons
make
ready
cried
to
us
all
to
den
ourselves
among
the
heather
by
which
forethought
the
shot
flew
harmless
then
we
started
up
and
every
one
with
the
best
aim
he
could
fired
at
the
dragoons
as
they
were
loading
their
carabines
several
men
and
horses
were
killed
and
many
wounded
claverhouse
seeing
this
commanded
his
men
to
charge
upon
us
but
the
ground
was
rough
the
heather
deep
and
the
moss
broken
where
peats
had
been
dug
and
the
horses
floundered
and
several
threw
their
riders
and
fell
themselves
we
had
now
loaded
again
and
the
second
fire
was
more
deadly
than
the
first
our
horsemen
also
seeing
how
the
dragoons
were
scattered
fell
in
the
confusion
as
it
were
man
for
man
upon
them
claverhouse
raged
and
commanded
but
no
one
now
could
or
would
obey
in
that
extremity
his
horse
was
killed
and
being
thrown
down
i
ran
forward
to
seize
him
if
i
could
prisoner
but
he
still
held
his
sword
in
his
hand
and
rising
as
i
came
up
used
it
manfully
and
with
one
stroke
almost
hewed
my
right
arm
from
my
shoulder
as
he
fled
i
attempted
for
a
moment
to
follow
but
staggered
and
fell
he
looked
back
as
he
escaped
and
i
cried
blood
for
blood
and
it
has
been
so
as
i
shall
hereafter
in
the
sequel
relate
when
the
day
was
won
we
found
we
numbered
among
the
slain
on
the
side
of
the
vanquished
nearly
twenty
of
the
dragoons
on
our
side
we
lost
but
one
man
john
morton
a
ripe
saint
but
several
were
wounded
and
john
weir
and
william
daniel
died
of
their
wounds
such
was
the
day
of
drumclog
being
wounded
i
was
carried
to
a
neighbouring
farm
attended
by
my
brother
and
son
and
there
put
upon
a
cart
and
sent
home
to
quharist
as
it
was
thought
i
would
be
best
attended
there
they
then
returned
to
the
rest
of
the
host
who
seeing
themselves
thus
brought
into
open
war
resolved
forthwith
to
proceed
to
glasgow
and
to
raise
again
the
banner
of
the
covenant
but
claverhouse
had
fled
thither
burning
with
the
thought
of
being
so
shorn
in
his
military
pride
by
raw
and
undisciplined
countrymen
whom
if
we
had
been
bred
soldiers
maybe
he
would
have
honoured
but
being
what
we
were
though
our
honour
was
the
greater
he
hated
us
with
the
deadly
aversion
that
is
begotten
of
vanity
chastised
for
that
it
was
which
incited
him
to
ravage
the
west
country
with
such
remorselessness
and
which
when
our
men
were
next
day
repulsed
at
glasgow
with
the
loss
of
lives
made
him
hinder
the
removal
of
the
bodies
from
the
streets
till
it
was
said
the
butchers
dogs
began
to
prey
upon
them
but
not
to
insist
on
matters
of
hearsay
nor
to
dwell
at
any
greater
length
on
those
afflicting
events
i
must
refer
the
courteous
reader
to
the
history
of
the
times
for
what
followed
it
being
enough
for
me
to
state
here
that
as
soon
as
the
news
spread
of
the
battle
and
the
victory
the
persecuted
ran
flocking
in
from
all
quarters
by
which
the
rope
of
sand
that
the
lord
permitted
monmouth
to
break
at
was
soon
formed
my
brother
and
my
son
were
both
there
and
there
my
gallant
michael
lies
my
brother
then
verging
on
threescore
being
among
the
prisoners
was
after
sore
sufferings
in
the
greyfriars
of
edinburgh
sent
on
board
a
vessel
as
a
bondsman
to
the
plantations
in
america
his
wrongs
however
were
happily
soon
over
for
the
ship
in
which
he
was
embarked
perished
among
the
orkney
islands
and
he
with
two
hundred
other
sufferers
received
the
crown
of
martyrdom
from
the
waves
o
charles
stuart
king
of
scotland
and
thou
james
sharp
false
and
cruel
men
but
ye
are
called
to
your
account
and
what
avails
it
now
to
the
childless
father
to
rail
upon
your
memory
chapter
lxxii
before
proceeding
farther
at
this
present
time
with
the
doleful
tale
of
my
own
sufferings
it
is
required
of
me
as
an
impartial
historian
to
note
here
a
very
singular
example
of
the
spirit
of
piety
which
reigned
in
the
hearts
of
the
covenanters
especially
as
i
shall
have
to
show
that
such
was
the
cruel
and
implacable
nature
of
the
persecution
that
time
had
not
its
wonted
influence
to
soften
in
any
degree
its
rigour
thirteen
years
had
passed
from
the
time
of
the
pentland
raid
and
surely
the
manner
in
which
the
country
had
suffered
for
that
rising
might
in
so
long
a
course
of
years
have
subdued
the
animosity
with
which
we
were
pursued
especially
as
during
the
earl
of
tweeddale
administration
the
bonds
of
peace
had
been
accepted
but
lauderdale
now
at
the
head
of
the
councils
was
rapacious
for
money
and
therefore
all
offences
if
i
may
employ
that
courtly
term
by
which
our
endeavours
to
taste
of
the
truth
were
designated
all
old
offences
as
i
was
saying
were
renewed
against
us
as
recent
crimes
and
an
innocent
charity
to
the
remains
of
those
who
had
suffered
for
the
pentland
raid
was
made
a
reason
after
the
battle
of
to
revive
the
persecution
of
those
who
had
been
out
in
that
affair
the
matter
particularly
referred
to
arose
out
of
the
following
circumstances
the
number
of
honest
and
pious
men
who
were
executed
in
different
places
and
who
had
their
heads
and
their
right
hands
with
which
they
signed
the
covenant
at
lanerk
cut
off
and
placed
on
the
gates
of
towns
and
over
the
doors
of
tolbooths
had
been
very
great
and
it
was
very
grievous
and
a
sore
thing
to
the
friends
and
acquaintances
of
those
martyrs
when
they
went
to
glasgow
or
kilmarnock
or
irvine
or
ayr
on
their
farm
business
to
tryst
or
market
to
see
the
remains
of
persons
whom
they
so
loved
and
respected
in
life
bleaching
in
the
winds
and
the
rains
of
heaven
it
was
indeed
a
matter
of
great
to
behold
such
animosity
carried
beyond
the
grave
and
few
they
were
who
could
withstand
the
sight
of
the
orphans
that
came
thither
pointing
out
to
one
another
their
fathers
bones
and
weeping
as
they
did
so
and
vowing
with
an
innocent
indignation
that
they
would
avenge
their
martyrdom
well
do
i
remember
the
great
sorrow
that
arose
one
in
irvine
some
five
or
six
years
after
the
pentland
raid
when
mrs
came
with
her
four
weans
and
her
aged
gudemother
to
look
at
the
relics
of
her
husband
who
was
martyred
for
his
part
in
that
rising
the
bones
were
standing
with
those
of
another
martyr
of
that
time
on
a
shelf
which
had
been
put
up
for
the
purpose
below
the
first
in
the
steeple
just
above
the
door
the
two
women
were
very
decent
in
their
apparel
rather
more
so
than
the
common
country
wives
the
gudemother
in
particular
had
a
cast
of
gentility
both
in
her
look
and
garments
and
i
have
heard
the
cause
of
it
expounded
from
her
having
been
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
reformation
preachers
in
the
epoch
of
john
knox
she
had
a
crimson
satin
plaid
over
her
head
and
she
wore
a
black
silk
apron
and
a
grey
camlet
gown
with
the
one
hand
she
held
the
plaid
close
to
her
neck
and
the
youngest
child
a
lassie
of
seven
years
or
so
had
hold
of
her
by
the
of
the
other
mrs
was
more
of
a
robust
fabric
and
she
was
without
any
plaid
soberly
dressed
in
the
weeds
of
a
widow
with
a
clean
cambric
handkerchief
very
snodly
prined
over
her
breast
the
children
were
likewise
beinly
apparelled
and
the
two
sons
were
buirdly
and
brave
laddies
the
one
about
nine
and
the
other
maybe
eleven
years
old
it
would
seem
that
this
had
been
the
first
of
their
pilgrimages
of
sorrow
for
they
stood
some
time
in
a
row
at
the
foot
of
the
tolbooth
stair
looking
up
at
the
remains
and
wondering
with
tears
in
their
eyes
which
were
those
they
had
come
to
see
their
appearance
drew
around
them
many
onlookers
both
of
the
country
folk
about
the
cross
and
inhabitants
of
the
town
but
every
one
respected
their
sorrow
and
none
ventured
to
disturb
them
with
any
questions
for
all
saw
that
they
were
kith
or
kin
to
the
godly
men
who
had
testified
to
the
truth
and
the
covenant
in
death
it
happened
however
that
i
had
occasion
to
pass
by
and
some
of
the
town
folk
who
recollected
me
said
whisperingly
to
one
another
but
loud
enough
to
be
heard
that
i
was
one
of
the
persecuted
whereupon
mrs
turned
round
and
said
to
me
with
a
constrained
composure
can
ye
tell
me
whilk
o
yon
the
head
and
hand
o
john
that
was
executed
for
the
covenanting
at
lanerk
i
knew
the
remains
well
for
they
had
been
pointed
out
to
me
and
i
had
seen
them
very
often
but
really
the
sight
of
the
two
women
and
the
fatherless
bairns
so
overcame
me
that
i
was
unable
to
answer
it
the
head
and
the
hand
beside
it
that
has
but
twa
fingers
left
on
the
kirkgate
end
o
the
shelf
replied
a
person
in
the
crowd
whom
i
knew
at
once
by
his
voice
to
be
willy
sutherland
the
hangman
although
i
had
not
seen
him
from
the
night
of
my
evasion
and
here
let
me
not
forget
to
set
down
the
christian
worth
and
constancy
of
that
simple
and
godly
creature
who
rather
than
be
instrumental
in
the
guilty
judgment
by
which
john
and
his
were
doomed
to
die
did
himself
almost
endure
martyrdom
and
yet
never
swerved
in
his
purpose
nor
was
abated
in
his
integrity
in
so
much
that
when
questioned
thereafter
anent
the
same
by
the
earl
of
eglinton
and
his
lordship
being
moved
by
the
simplicity
of
his
piety
said
poor
man
you
did
well
in
not
doing
what
they
would
have
had
you
to
do
my
lord
replied
willy
you
are
speaking
treason
and
yet
you
persecute
to
the
uttermost
which
shows
that
you
go
against
the
light
of
your
conscience
do
you
say
so
to
me
after
i
kept
you
from
being
hanged
said
his
lordship
keep
me
from
being
drowned
and
i
will
still
tell
you
the
verity
the
which
honesty
in
that
poor
man
begat
for
him
a
compassionate
regard
that
the
dignities
of
many
great
and
many
noble
in
that
time
could
never
command
when
the
sorrowful
had
indulged
themselves
in
their
melancholy
contemplation
they
went
away
followed
by
the
multitude
with
silence
and
sympathy
till
they
had
mounted
upon
the
cart
which
they
had
brought
with
them
into
the
town
but
from
that
time
every
one
began
to
speak
of
the
impiety
of
leaving
the
bones
so
wofully
exposed
and
after
the
skirmish
at
drumclog
where
robin
the
eldest
of
the
two
striplings
above
spoken
of
happened
to
be
when
mr
john
welsh
with
the
carrick
men
that
went
to
was
sent
into
glasgow
to
bury
the
heads
and
hands
of
the
martyrs
there
robin
came
with
a
party
of
his
friends
to
irvine
to
bury
his
father
bones
i
was
not
myself
present
at
the
interment
being
as
i
have
narrated
confined
to
my
bed
by
reason
of
my
wound
but
i
was
told
by
the
neighbours
that
it
was
a
very
solemn
and
affecting
scene
the
grieved
lad
carried
the
relics
of
his
father
in
a
small
box
in
his
hands
covered
with
a
white
towel
and
the
godly
inhabitants
of
the
town
young
and
old
and
of
all
denominations
to
the
number
of
several
hundreds
followed
him
to
the
grave
where
the
body
was
lying
and
willy
sutherland
moved
by
a
simple
sorrow
was
the
last
of
all
and
he
walked
as
i
was
told
alone
behind
with
his
bonnet
in
his
hand
for
from
his
calling
he
counted
himself
not
on
an
equality
with
other
men
but
it
is
time
that
i
should
return
from
this
digression
to
the
main
account
of
my
narrative
chapter
lxxiii
being
wounded
as
i
have
rehearsed
at
drumclog
and
carried
to
my
own
house
sarah
lochrig
while
she
grieved
with
a
mother
grief
for
the
loss
of
our
and
the
mournful
fate
of
my
honest
brother
advanced
my
cure
more
by
her
loving
ministrations
to
my
aching
mind
than
by
the
medicaments
that
were
applied
to
the
bodily
wound
in
so
much
that
something
like
a
dawn
of
comfort
was
vouchsafed
to
me
our
parish
was
singularly
allowed
to
remain
unmolested
when
after
the
woful
day
of
claverhouse
came
to
ravage
the
shire
of
ayr
and
to
take
revenge
for
the
discomfiture
which
he
had
suffered
in
his
endeavour
to
disturb
the
worship
and
sacrament
at
still
however
at
times
clouds
overcame
my
spirit
and
one
night
my
daughter
margaret
had
a
remarkable
dream
which
taught
us
to
expect
some
particular
visitation
it
was
surely
a
mysterious
reservation
for
the
greater
calamity
which
ensued
that
while
the
vial
of
wrath
was
pouring
out
around
us
my
house
should
have
been
allowed
to
remain
so
unmolested
often
indeed
when
in
our
nightly
worship
i
returned
thanks
for
a
blessing
so
wonderful
in
that
time
of
general
woe
has
a
strange
fear
fallen
upon
me
and
i
have
trembled
in
thought
as
if
the
thing
for
which
i
sent
up
the
incense
of
my
thanks
to
heaven
was
a
device
of
the
enemy
of
man
to
make
me
think
myself
more
deserving
of
favour
than
the
thousands
of
covenanted
brethren
who
then
in
scotland
were
drinking
of
the
bitterness
of
the
suffering
but
in
proportion
as
i
was
then
spared
the
heavier
afterwards
was
my
trial
among
the
prisoners
taken
at
were
many
persons
from
our
parish
and
neighbourhood
who
after
their
sufferings
among
the
tombs
and
graves
of
the
greyfriars
at
edinburgh
were
allowed
to
return
home
though
in
this
there
was
a
show
of
clemency
it
was
yet
but
a
more
subtle
method
of
the
tyranny
to
reach
new
victims
for
those
honest
men
were
not
long
home
till
grievous
were
set
agoing
to
bring
to
trial
not
only
all
those
who
were
at
bothwell
or
approved
of
that
rising
but
likewise
those
who
had
been
at
the
pentland
raid
and
the
better
to
ensure
condemnation
and
punishment
sixteen
persons
were
cited
from
every
parish
to
bear
witness
as
to
who
among
their
neighbours
had
been
out
at
bothwell
or
had
harboured
any
of
those
who
were
there
the
wicked
curates
made
themselves
in
this
grievous
matter
engines
of
espionage
by
giving
in
the
names
of
those
their
parishioners
whom
they
knew
could
bear
the
best
testimony
thus
it
was
that
many
who
had
escaped
from
the
slaughter
from
the
horrors
of
the
greyfriars
and
from
the
drowning
in
the
orkneys
and
like
myself
had
resumed
their
quiet
country
labour
were
marked
out
for
destruction
for
the
witnesses
cited
to
ayr
against
us
were
persons
who
had
been
released
from
the
greyfriars
as
i
have
said
and
who
being
honest
men
could
not
when
put
to
their
oaths
but
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
the
matters
charged
against
us
and
nothing
surely
could
better
show
the
devilish
spirit
with
which
those
in
authority
were
at
that
time
actuated
nor
the
unchristian
nature
of
the
prelacy
than
that
the
prisoners
should
thus
have
been
set
free
to
be
made
the
accusers
of
their
neighbours
and
that
the
curates
men
professing
to
be
ministers
of
the
gospel
should
have
been
such
fit
instruments
for
such
machinations
but
to
hasten
forward
to
the
fate
and
issue
of
this
tyranny
i
shall
leave
all
generalities
and
proceed
with
the
events
of
my
own
case
and
in
doing
so
i
shall
endeavour
what
is
in
me
to
inscribe
the
particulars
with
a
steady
hand
for
i
dare
no
longer
now
trust
myself
with
looking
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
of
the
field
of
my
matter
i
shall
however
try
to
narrate
things
just
as
they
happened
leaving
the
courteous
reader
to
judge
what
passed
at
the
time
in
the
suffocating
throbs
wherewith
my
heart
was
then
affected
it
was
the
last
day
of
february
of
the
year
following
that
in
consequence
of
these
subtle
and
wicked
devices
i
was
taken
up
i
had
from
my
wound
been
in
an
ailing
state
for
many
months
and
could
then
do
little
in
the
field
but
the
weather
for
the
season
was
mild
and
i
had
walked
out
in
the
tranquillity
of
a
sunny
afternoon
to
give
my
son
joseph
some
instructions
in
the
method
of
ploughing
for
though
he
was
then
but
in
his
thirteenth
year
he
was
a
stripling
in
capacity
and
sense
he
was
indeed
a
goodly
plant
and
i
had
hoped
in
my
old
age
to
have
sat
beneath
the
shelter
of
his
branches
but
the
axe
of
the
feller
was
untimely
laid
to
the
root
and
it
was
too
soon
with
all
the
blossoms
of
the
fairest
promise
cast
down
into
the
dust
but
my
task
now
is
of
vengeance
and
justice
not
of
sorrowing
and
i
must
more
sternly
grasp
the
iron
pen
a
party
of
soldiers
who
had
been
that
afternoon
sent
out
to
bring
in
certain
persons
among
whom
i
was
one
in
a
list
malignantly
transmitted
to
the
archbishop
of
glasgow
by
andrew
dornoch
the
prelatic
usurper
of
our
minister
place
as
i
was
leaving
the
field
where
my
son
was
ploughing
saw
me
from
the
road
and
ordered
me
to
halt
till
they
came
up
or
they
would
fire
at
me
it
would
have
been
unavailing
of
me
in
the
state
i
then
was
to
have
attempted
to
flee
so
i
halted
and
after
some
entreaty
with
the
soldiers
got
permission
from
them
to
have
my
horse
and
cart
yoket
as
i
was
not
very
well
and
so
to
be
carried
to
ayr
and
here
i
should
note
down
that
although
there
was
in
general
a
coarse
spirit
among
the
king
forces
yet
in
these
men
there
was
a
touch
of
common
humanity
this
was
no
doubt
partly
owing
to
their
having
been
some
months
quartered
in
irvine
where
they
became
naturally
softened
by
the
friendly
spirit
of
the
place
it
was
not
however
ordained
that
men
so
merciful
should
be
permitted
to
remain
long
there
as
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
the
object
of
the
trials
to
which
the
covenanters
were
in
this
manner
subjected
was
chiefly
to
raise
money
and
forfeitures
for
the
rapacious
duke
of
lauderdale
then
in
the
rule
and
power
of
the
council
at
edinburgh
my
being
carried
away
prisoner
to
ayr
awakened
less
grief
and
consternation
in
my
family
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
event
through
the
humane
permission
of
my
guard
having
a
little
time
to
confer
with
sarah
lochrig
before
going
away
it
was
settled
between
us
that
she
should
gather
together
what
money
she
could
procure
either
by
loan
or
by
selling
our
corn
and
cattle
in
order
to
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
fine
that
we
counted
would
be
laid
upon
us
i
was
then
taken
to
the
tolbooth
of
ayr
where
many
other
covenanted
brethren
were
lying
to
await
the
proceedings
of
the
which
was
to
be
opened
by
the
lord
kelburne
from
glasgow
on
the
second
day
after
i
had
been
carried
thither
among
the
prisoners
were
several
who
knew
me
well
and
who
condoled
as
christians
with
me
for
the
loss
i
had
sustained
at
bothwell
so
but
for
the
denial
of
the
fresh
and
heavenly
air
and
the
freedom
of
the
fields
the
time
of
our
captivity
might
have
been
a
season
of
much
solace
for
they
were
all
devout
men
and
the
tolbooth
instead
of
resounding
with
the
imprecations
of
malefactors
became
melodious
with
the
voice
of
psalms
and
of
holy
communion
and
the
sweet
intercourse
of
spirits
that
delighted
in
one
another
for
the
constancy
with
which
they
had
borne
their
testimony
when
the
lord
kelburne
arrived
on
the
first
day
that
the
court
opened
i
was
summoned
to
respond
to
the
offences
laid
to
my
charge
if
any
charge
of
offence
it
may
be
called
wherein
the
purpose
of
the
court
was
seemingly
to
search
out
opinions
that
might
serve
as
matter
to
justify
the
infliction
of
the
fines
the
whole
end
and
intent
of
those
circuits
not
being
to
award
justice
but
to
find
the
means
of
extorting
money
in
some
respects
however
i
was
more
mercifully
dealt
by
than
many
of
my
but
in
order
to
show
how
even
in
my
case
the
laws
were
perverted
i
will
here
set
down
a
brief
record
of
my
examination
or
trial
as
it
was
called
chapter
lxxiv
the
was
full
of
people
when
i
was
taken
thither
and
the
lord
kelburne
who
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
was
abetted
in
the
proceedings
by
murray
an
advocate
from
edinburgh
they
were
sitting
at
a
wide
round
table
within
a
fence
which
prevented
the
spectators
from
pressing
in
upon
them
there
were
many
papers
and
letters
folded
up
in
bundles
lying
before
them
and
a
candle
burning
and
wax
for
sigillation
besides
lord
kelburne
and
his
counsellor
there
were
divers
gentlemen
seated
at
the
table
and
two
clerks
to
make
notations
lord
kelburne
in
his
appearance
was
a
man
and
for
his
years
his
hair
was
very
hoary
for
though
he
was
seemingly
not
passing
fifty
it
was
in
a
manner
quite
blanched
in
speech
he
was
moderate
in
disposition
indulgent
and
verily
towards
me
he
acted
in
his
harsh
duty
with
much
gentleness
but
murray
had
a
doure
aspect
for
his
years
and
there
was
a
smile
among
his
features
not
pleasant
to
behold
breeding
rather
distrust
and
dread
than
winning
confidence
or
affection
which
are
the
natural
fruit
of
a
countenance
rightly
gladdened
he
looked
at
me
from
aneath
his
brows
as
if
i
had
been
a
malefactor
and
turning
to
the
lord
kelburne
said
he
has
the
true
fanatical
yellow
look
this
was
a
base
observe
for
naturally
i
was
of
a
fresh
complexion
but
my
long
illness
and
the
close
air
of
the
prison
had
made
me
pale
after
some
more
impertinences
of
that
sort
he
then
said
ringan
gilhaize
you
were
at
the
battle
of
i
was
not
said
i
you
do
not
mean
to
say
so
surely
i
have
said
it
was
my
answer
whereupon
one
of
the
clerks
whispered
to
him
that
there
were
three
of
the
name
in
the
list
o
cried
he
i
crave
your
pardon
ringan
there
are
several
persons
of
your
name
and
though
you
were
not
at
bothwell
yourself
maybe
ye
ken
those
of
your
name
who
were
there
do
you
i
did
know
two
was
my
calm
answer
one
was
my
brother
and
the
other
my
son
all
present
remained
very
silent
as
i
made
this
answer
and
the
lord
kelburne
bending
forward
leant
his
cheek
on
his
hand
as
he
rested
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
looked
very
earnestly
at
me
murray
resumed
and
pray
now
ringan
tell
us
what
has
become
of
the
two
rebels
they
were
covenanted
christians
said
i
my
son
lies
buried
with
those
that
were
slain
on
that
sore
occasion
but
your
brother
he
was
of
course
younger
than
you
no
he
was
older
well
well
no
matter
as
to
that
but
where
is
he
i
believe
he
is
with
his
maker
but
his
body
lies
among
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
of
the
orkney
seas
the
steadiness
of
the
lord
kelburne
countenance
saddened
into
the
look
of
compassion
and
he
said
to
murray
there
is
no
use
in
asking
him
any
more
questions
about
them
proceed
with
the
ordinary
interrogatories
there
was
a
murmur
of
satisfaction
towards
his
lordship
at
this
and
murray
said
and
so
you
say
that
those
in
the
late
rebellion
at
bothwell
were
not
rebels
i
said
sir
that
my
son
and
my
brother
were
covenanted
christians
this
i
delivered
with
a
firm
voice
which
seemed
to
produce
some
effect
on
the
lord
kelburne
who
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
crossing
his
arms
over
his
breast
looked
still
more
eagerly
towards
me
do
you
mean
then
to
deny
said
murray
that
the
late
rebellion
was
not
a
rebellion
it
would
be
hard
sir
to
say
what
it
was
for
the
causes
thereto
leading
replied
i
were
provocations
concerning
things
of
god
and
to
those
who
were
for
that
reason
religiously
there
i
do
not
think
in
a
right
sense
it
can
be
called
rebellion
those
who
were
there
for
carnal
motives
and
i
doubt
not
there
were
many
such
i
fancy
every
honest
man
may
say
it
was
with
them
rebellion
i
must
deal
more
closely
with
him
said
murray
to
his
lordship
but
his
lordship
before
allowing
him
to
put
any
more
questions
said
himself
to
me
but
you
know
to
state
the
thing
plainly
that
the
misguided
people
who
were
at
bothwell
had
banded
themselves
against
the
laws
of
the
realm
whether
from
religious
or
carnal
motives
is
not
the
business
we
are
here
to
sift
that
point
is
necessarily
remitted
to
god
and
their
consciences
murray
added
it
is
most
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
every
subject
is
free
to
determine
of
what
is
lawful
to
be
obeyed
the
thought
is
ridiculous
it
would
destroy
the
end
of
all
laws
which
are
for
the
advantage
of
communities
and
which
speak
the
sense
of
the
generality
touching
the
matter
and
things
to
which
they
refer
my
lord
said
i
addressing
myself
to
lord
kelburne
it
surely
will
be
denied
that
every
subject
is
free
to
exercise
his
discretion
with
respek
to
his
ain
conduct
and
your
lordship
kens
vera
weel
that
it
is
the
duty
of
subjects
to
know
the
laws
of
the
land
and
your
lordship
likewise
knows
that
god
has
given
laws
to
all
rulers
as
well
as
subjects
and
both
may
and
ought
to
know
his
laws
now
if
i
knowing
both
the
laws
of
god
and
the
laws
of
the
land
find
the
one
contrary
to
the
other
undoubtedly
god
laws
ought
to
hae
the
preference
in
my
obedience
his
lordship
looked
somewhat
satisfied
with
this
answer
but
murray
said
to
him
i
will
pose
him
with
this
question
if
presbyterian
government
were
established
as
it
was
in
the
year
and
some
ministers
were
not
free
to
comply
with
it
and
a
law
were
made
that
none
should
hear
them
out
o
doors
would
you
judge
it
reasonable
that
such
ministers
or
their
people
should
be
at
liberty
to
act
in
contempt
of
that
law
and
he
looked
mightily
content
with
himself
for
this
subtlety
but
i
said
really
sir
i
canna
see
a
reason
why
hearkening
to
a
preaching
in
the
fields
should
be
a
greater
guilt
than
doing
the
same
thing
indoors
if
i
were
of
your
principles
said
the
advocate
and
thought
in
my
conscience
that
the
laws
of
the
land
were
contrary
to
the
laws
of
god
and
that
i
could
not
conform
to
them
i
would
judge
it
my
duty
rather
to
go
out
of
the
nation
and
live
elsewhere
than
disturb
the
peace
of
the
land
that
were
to
suppose
two
things
said
i
first
that
rulers
may
make
laws
contrary
to
the
laws
of
god
and
that
when
such
laws
are
once
made
they
ought
to
be
submitted
to
but
i
think
sir
that
rulers
being
under
the
law
of
god
act
wickedly
and
in
rebellion
to
him
when
they
make
enactments
contrary
to
his
declared
will
and
surely
it
can
be
required
that
we
should
allow
wickedness
to
be
done
i
am
not
sure
said
murray
to
his
lordship
that
i
do
right
in
continuing
this
irrelevant
conversation
i
am
interested
in
the
honest
man
defence
replied
lord
kelburne
and
as
is
in
a
matter
of
conscience
let
us
hear
what
makes
it
so
well
then
resumed
the
advocate
what
can
you
say
to
the
barbarous
murder
of
archbishop
sharp
you
will
not
contend
that
murder
is
not
contrary
to
the
law
of
god
i
contended
said
i
that
any
sin
was
permitted
by
the
law
of
god
far
less
murder
which
is
expressly
forbidden
in
the
ten
commands
then
ye
acknowledge
the
murder
of
the
archbishop
to
have
been
murder
that
between
those
that
did
it
and
god
hooly
hooly
friend
cried
murray
that
ringan
winna
do
was
it
or
was
it
not
murder
can
i
tell
who
was
not
there
then
to
satisfy
your
conscience
on
that
score
ringan
i
would
ask
you
if
a
gang
of
ruffians
slay
a
defenceless
man
do
or
do
they
not
commit
murder
i
can
easily
answer
that
lord
kelburne
again
bent
eagerly
forward
and
rested
his
cheek
again
on
his
hand
placing
his
elbow
on
the
table
while
i
continued
a
gang
of
ruffians
coming
in
wantonness
or
for
plunder
upon
a
defenceless
man
and
putting
him
to
death
there
can
be
no
doubt
is
murder
but
it
has
not
yet
been
called
murder
to
kill
an
enemy
in
battle
and
therefore
if
the
captain
of
a
host
go
to
war
without
arms
and
thereby
be
defenceless
it
can
not
be
said
that
those
of
the
adverse
party
who
may
happen
to
slay
him
do
any
murder
do
you
mean
to
justify
the
manner
of
the
death
of
the
archbishop
exclaimed
the
advocate
starting
back
and
spreading
out
his
arms
in
wonderment
no
sir
replied
i
a
little
nettled
at
the
construction
he
would
put
upon
what
i
said
but
i
will
say
even
here
what
sir
davie
lindsay
o
the
mount
said
on
the
similar
event
o
cardinal
death
for
this
cardinal
i
grant
he
was
the
man
we
might
well
want
god
will
forgive
it
soon
but
of
a
truth
the
sooth
to
say
although
the
loon
be
well
away
the
fact
was
foully
done
there
was
a
rustle
of
gratification
among
all
in
the
court
as
i
said
the
rhyme
and
lord
kelburne
smiled
but
murray
somewhat
out
of
humour
said
i
fancy
my
lord
we
must
consider
this
as
an
admission
that
the
killing
of
the
archbishop
was
murder
i
fear
said
his
lordship
that
neither
of
the
two
questions
have
been
so
directly
put
as
to
justify
me
to
pronounce
any
decision
though
i
am
willing
to
put
the
most
favourable
construction
on
what
has
passed
and
then
his
lordship
looking
to
me
added
do
you
consider
the
late
rebellion
being
contrary
to
the
authority
rebellion
contrary
to
the
king
right
authority
replied
i
it
was
not
rebellion
but
contrary
to
an
authority
beyond
the
right
taken
by
him
despite
the
law
of
god
it
was
rebellion
wherefore
honest
man
rejoined
his
lordship
kindly
would
you
make
a
distinction
that
may
bring
harm
on
your
own
head
is
not
the
authority
instituted
by
law
and
prerogative
and
knowing
that
can
not
ye
say
that
those
who
rise
in
arms
against
it
are
rebels
my
lord
said
i
you
have
my
answer
for
in
truth
and
in
conscience
i
can
give
none
other
there
was
a
pause
for
a
short
space
and
one
of
the
clerks
looking
to
lord
kelburne
his
lordship
said
with
a
plain
reluctance
it
must
even
be
so
write
down
that
he
is
not
clear
the
late
rebellion
should
be
called
a
rebellion
and
casting
his
eyes
entreatingly
towards
me
he
added
but
i
think
you
acknowledge
that
the
assassination
of
archbishop
sharp
was
a
murder
my
lord
said
i
your
questions
are
propounded
as
tests
and
therefore
as
an
honest
man
i
can
not
suffer
that
my
answers
should
be
scant
lest
i
might
be
thought
to
waver
in
faith
and
was
backward
in
my
testimony
no
my
lord
i
will
not
call
the
killing
of
sharp
murder
for
on
my
conscience
i
do
verily
think
he
deserved
the
death
first
because
of
his
apostacy
second
because
of
the
laws
of
which
he
was
the
instigator
whereby
the
laws
of
god
have
been
contravened
and
third
for
the
woes
that
those
laws
have
brought
upon
the
land
the
which
stirred
the
hearts
of
the
people
against
him
above
all
i
think
his
death
was
no
murder
because
he
was
so
strong
in
his
legalities
that
he
could
not
be
brought
to
punishment
by
those
to
whom
he
had
caused
the
greatest
wrong
and
i
thought
in
saying
these
words
of
my
desolated
daughter
of
his
own
sad
death
in
the
stormy
seas
of
the
orkneys
and
of
my
brave
and
gallant
michael
that
was
lying
in
his
shroudless
grave
in
the
cold
clay
of
bothwell
lord
kelburne
was
troubled
at
my
answer
and
was
about
to
remonstrate
but
seeing
the
tear
start
into
my
eye
as
those
things
came
into
my
mind
he
said
nothing
but
nodding
to
the
clerk
he
bade
him
write
down
that
i
would
not
acknowledge
the
killing
of
the
archbishop
a
murder
he
then
rose
and
adjourned
the
court
remanding
me
to
prison
saying
that
he
would
send
me
word
what
would
be
the
extent
of
my
punishment
chapter
lxxv
the
same
night
it
was
intimated
to
me
that
i
was
fined
in
five
hundred
marks
and
that
bonds
were
required
to
be
given
for
the
payment
upon
the
granting
of
which
in
consideration
of
my
the
lord
kelburne
had
consented
i
should
be
set
free
this
was
in
many
respects
a
more
lenient
sentence
than
i
had
expected
and
in
the
hope
that
perhaps
sarah
lochrig
might
have
been
able
to
provide
the
money
so
as
to
render
the
granting
of
the
bonds
and
the
procuring
of
cautioners
unnecessary
i
sent
over
a
man
on
horseback
to
tell
her
the
news
and
the
man
in
returning
brought
my
son
joseph
behind
him
sent
by
his
mother
to
urge
me
to
give
the
bonds
at
once
as
she
had
not
been
able
to
raise
so
much
money
and
the
more
to
incite
me
if
there
had
been
need
for
incitement
she
had
willed
joseph
to
tell
me
that
a
party
of
claverhouse
dragoons
had
been
quartered
on
the
house
that
morning
to
live
there
till
the
fine
was
paid
of
the
character
of
those
freebooters
i
needed
no
certificate
they
had
filled
every
other
place
wherever
they
had
been
quartered
with
shame
and
sorrow
and
therefore
i
was
indeed
roused
to
hear
that
my
defenceless
daughters
were
in
their
power
so
i
lost
no
time
in
sending
my
son
to
entreat
two
of
his
mother
relations
who
were
bein
merchants
in
ayr
to
join
me
in
the
bond
a
thing
which
they
did
in
the
most
compassionate
manner
and
the
better
to
expedite
the
business
i
got
it
to
be
permitted
by
the
lord
kelburne
that
the
bonds
should
be
sent
the
same
day
to
irvine
where
i
hoped
to
be
able
next
morning
to
discharge
them
all
this
was
happily
concerted
and
brought
to
a
pleasant
issue
before
sunset
at
which
time
i
was
discharged
from
the
tolbooth
carrying
with
me
many
pious
wishes
from
those
who
were
there
and
who
had
not
been
so
gently
dealt
by
it
was
my
intent
to
have
proceeded
home
the
same
night
but
my
son
was
very
tired
with
the
many
errands
he
had
run
that
day
and
by
his
long
ride
in
the
morning
moreover
i
was
myself
in
need
of
repose
for
my
anxiety
had
brought
on
a
disturbance
in
my
blood
and
my
limbs
shook
and
i
was
altogether
unable
to
undertake
any
journey
i
was
therefore
too
easily
entreated
of
archibald
lochrig
my
wife
cousin
and
one
of
my
cautioners
to
stop
in
his
house
that
evening
but
next
morning
being
much
refreshed
with
a
pleasant
sleep
and
the
fallacious
cheering
of
happy
dreams
i
left
ayr
with
my
son
before
the
break
of
day
and
we
travelled
with
light
feet
for
our
hearts
were
lifted
up
with
hope
though
my
youth
was
long
past
and
many
things
had
happened
to
sadden
my
spirit
i
yet
felt
on
that
occasion
an
unaccountable
sense
of
kindliness
and
joy
the
flame
of
life
was
as
it
were
renewed
and
brightened
in
the
pure
and
breezy
air
of
the
morning
and
a
bounding
gladness
rose
in
my
bosom
as
my
eye
expatiated
around
in
the
freedom
of
the
spacious
fields
on
the
the
living
sea
seemed
as
if
the
pulses
of
its
moving
waters
were
in
unison
with
the
throbbings
of
my
spirit
and
like
jocund
maidens
disporting
themselves
in
the
flowing
tide
the
gentle
waves
lifting
their
heads
and
spreading
out
their
arms
and
raising
their
white
bosoms
to
the
rising
sun
came
as
it
were
happily
to
the
smooth
sands
of
the
sparkling
shore
the
grace
of
enjoyment
brightened
and
blithened
all
things
there
was
a
cheerfulness
in
the
songs
of
the
little
birds
that
enchanted
the
young
heart
of
my
blooming
boy
to
break
forth
into
singing
and
his
carol
was
gayer
than
the
melody
of
the
lark
but
that
morning
was
the
last
time
that
either
of
us
could
ever
after
know
pleasure
any
more
in
this
world
eager
to
be
home
and
that
i
might
share
with
sarah
lochrig
and
our
children
the
joy
of
thankfulness
for
my
deliverance
i
had
resolved
to
call
in
passing
through
irvine
at
the
clerk
chamber
to
inquire
if
the
bonds
had
been
sent
from
ayr
that
my
cautioners
might
be
as
soon
as
possible
discharged
but
we
had
been
so
early
that
we
reached
the
town
while
the
inhabitants
were
yet
all
asleep
so
that
we
thought
it
would
be
as
well
to
go
straight
home
and
accordingly
we
passed
down
the
gait
and
through
the
port
without
seeing
any
person
in
the
street
save
only
the
as
he
was
going
with
his
horn
to
sound
for
the
cows
to
be
sent
out
to
go
with
him
to
the
moor
the
sight
of
a
town
in
the
peacefulness
of
the
morning
slumbers
and
of
a
simple
man
going
forth
to
lead
the
quiet
cattle
to
pasture
filled
my
mind
with
softer
thoughts
than
i
had
long
known
and
i
said
to
my
son
surely
those
who
would
molest
the
peace
of
the
poor
hae
rightly
tasted
the
blessing
of
beholding
the
confidence
with
which
they
trust
themselves
in
the
watches
of
the
night
and
amidst
the
perils
of
their
barren
lot
and
i
felt
my
heart
thaw
again
into
charity
with
all
men
and
i
was
thankful
for
the
delight
as
i
was
thus
tasting
again
the
luxury
of
gentle
thoughts
a
band
of
five
dragoons
came
along
the
road
and
joseph
said
to
me
that
they
were
the
same
who
had
been
quartered
in
our
house
i
looked
at
them
as
they
passed
by
but
they
turned
their
heads
aside
i
wonder
said
my
son
that
they
did
na
speak
to
me
i
thought
they
had
a
black
look
no
doubt
joseph
was
my
answer
the
men
are
no
lost
to
a
sense
of
shame
they
canna
but
be
rebuked
at
the
sight
of
a
man
that
maybe
against
their
will
poor
fellows
they
were
sent
to
oppress
i
dinna
like
them
the
day
father
they
unco
like
said
the
thoughtful
and
observing
stripling
but
my
spirit
was
at
the
time
full
of
towards
all
men
and
i
reasoned
with
him
against
giving
way
to
unkind
thoughts
expounding
to
the
best
of
my
ability
the
nature
of
and
the
heavenlyness
of
saying
to
him
the
nature
of
charity
like
the
light
o
the
sun
by
which
all
things
are
cherished
it
is
the
brightness
of
the
soul
and
the
glorious
quality
which
proves
our
celestial
descent
our
other
feelings
are
common
to
a
creatures
but
the
feeling
of
charity
is
divine
it
the
only
thing
in
which
man
partakes
of
the
nature
of
god
discoursing
in
this
scriptural
manner
we
reached
the
my
heart
beat
high
with
gladness
my
son
bounded
forward
to
tell
his
mother
and
sisters
of
my
coming
on
gaining
the
brow
of
the
hill
he
leapt
from
the
ground
with
a
frantic
cry
and
clasped
his
hands
i
ran
towards
him
but
i
remember
no
more
though
at
times
something
crosses
my
mind
and
i
have
wild
visions
of
roofless
walls
and
a
crowd
of
weeping
women
and
silent
men
digging
among
ashes
and
a
beautiful
body
all
dropping
wet
brought
on
a
deal
from
the
and
of
men
as
it
was
carried
by
seizing
me
by
the
arms
and
tying
my
hands
and
then
i
fancy
myself
in
a
house
fastened
to
a
chair
and
sometimes
i
think
i
was
lifted
out
and
placed
to
beek
in
the
sun
and
to
taste
the
fresh
air
but
what
these
things
import
i
dare
only
guess
for
no
one
has
ever
told
me
what
became
of
my
benign
sarah
lochrig
and
our
two
blooming
daughters
all
is
phantasma
that
i
recollect
of
the
day
of
my
return
home
i
said
my
soul
was
iron
and
my
heart
converted
into
stone
o
that
they
were
indeed
so
but
sorrowing
is
a
vain
thing
and
my
task
must
not
stand
still
when
i
left
ayr
the
leaves
were
green
and
the
fields
gay
and
the
waters
glad
and
when
the
yellow
leaf
rustled
on
the
ground
and
the
waters
were
drumly
and
the
river
roaring
i
was
somehow
i
know
not
by
what
means
in
the
and
a
film
fell
from
the
eyes
of
my
reason
and
i
looked
around
and
my
little
boy
had
hold
of
me
by
the
hand
and
i
said
to
him
joseph
what
yon
sae
big
and
green
in
our
lair
and
he
gazed
in
my
face
and
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
replied
father
they
are
a
in
the
same
grave
i
took
my
hand
out
of
his
i
walked
slowly
to
the
green
tomb
i
knelt
down
and
i
caused
my
son
to
kneel
beside
me
and
i
vowed
enmity
for
ever
against
charles
stuart
and
all
of
his
line
and
i
prayed
in
the
words
of
the
psalmist
that
when
he
was
judged
he
might
be
condemned
then
we
rose
but
my
son
said
to
me
father
i
canna
wish
his
condemnation
but
i
fight
by
your
side
till
we
have
harlt
him
down
from
his
bloody
throne
and
i
felt
that
i
had
forgotten
i
was
a
christian
and
i
again
knelt
down
and
prayed
but
it
was
for
the
sin
i
had
done
in
the
vengeance
of
the
latter
clause
nevertheless
lord
i
then
cried
as
thou
thyself
didst
take
the
sceptre
from
saul
and
gave
the
crown
to
david
make
me
an
instrument
to
work
out
the
purposes
of
thy
dreadful
justice
which
in
time
will
come
to
be
then
i
rose
again
and
went
towards
the
place
where
my
home
had
been
but
when
i
saw
the
ruins
i
ran
back
to
the
and
threw
myself
on
the
grave
and
cried
to
the
earth
to
open
and
receive
me
but
the
lord
had
heard
my
prayer
and
while
i
lay
there
he
sent
down
his
consoling
angel
and
the
whirlwind
of
my
spirit
was
calmed
and
i
remembered
the
promise
of
my
son
to
fight
by
my
side
and
i
rose
to
prepare
myself
for
the
warfare
while
i
was
lying
on
the
ground
several
of
the
neighbours
had
heard
my
wild
cries
and
came
into
the
but
by
that
time
the
course
of
the
tempest
had
been
staid
and
they
stood
apart
with
my
son
who
told
them
i
was
come
again
to
myself
and
they
thought
they
ought
not
to
disturb
me
when
however
they
saw
me
rise
they
drew
near
and
spoke
kindly
to
me
and
zachariah
smylie
invited
me
to
go
back
with
him
to
his
house
for
it
was
with
him
that
i
had
been
sheltered
during
the
frenzy
but
i
said
no
i
will
neither
taste
meat
nor
drink
nor
seek
to
rest
myself
till
i
have
again
a
sword
and
i
entreated
him
to
give
me
a
little
money
that
with
my
son
we
might
go
into
irvine
and
provide
ourselves
with
weapons
the
worthy
man
looked
very
sorrowful
to
hear
me
so
speak
and
some
of
the
others
that
were
standing
by
began
to
reason
with
me
and
to
represent
the
peril
of
any
enterprise
at
that
time
but
i
pointed
to
the
grave
and
said
friens
do
you
ken
what
in
yon
place
and
do
ye
counsel
me
to
peace
at
which
words
they
turned
aside
and
shook
their
heads
and
zachariah
smylie
went
and
brought
me
a
purse
of
money
which
having
put
into
my
bosom
i
took
my
son
by
the
hand
and
bidding
them
all
farewell
we
walked
to
the
town
silently
together
and
i
thought
of
my
words
in
his
grief
that
the
speed
of
lightning
was
slow
to
the
wishes
of
revenge
chapter
lxxvi
on
arriving
in
irvine
we
went
to
the
shop
of
archibald
macrusty
a
dealer
in
iron
implements
and
i
bought
from
him
two
swords
without
hilts
which
he
sold
wrapt
in
as
a
method
of
disguise
that
the
ironmongers
were
obligated
to
have
recourse
to
at
that
time
on
account
of
the
search
now
and
then
made
for
weapons
by
the
soldiers
ever
from
the
time
that
claverhouse
came
to
disarm
the
people
and
when
i
had
bought
the
two
blades
we
went
to
bailie
girvan
shop
which
was
a
nest
of
a
things
and
bought
two
hilts
without
any
questions
being
asked
for
the
bailie
was
a
discreet
man
with
a
warm
heart
to
the
covenant
and
not
selling
whole
swords
but
only
hilts
and
hefts
it
could
not
be
imputed
to
him
that
he
was
guilty
of
selling
arms
to
suspected
persons
being
thus
provided
with
two
swords
we
went
into
james
public
where
having
partaken
of
some
refreshment
we
remained
solemnly
sitting
by
ourselves
till
towards
the
gloaming
when
recollecting
that
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
us
in
the
halts
of
our
undertaking
i
sent
out
my
son
to
buy
a
bible
and
while
he
was
absent
i
fell
asleep
on
awaking
from
my
slumber
i
felt
greatly
composed
and
refreshed
i
reflected
on
the
events
of
the
day
and
the
terrible
truths
that
had
broken
in
upon
me
and
i
was
not
moved
with
the
same
stings
of
desperation
that
on
my
coming
to
myself
had
shot
like
fire
through
my
brain
so
i
began
to
consider
of
the
purpose
whereon
i
was
bowne
and
that
i
had
formed
no
plan
nor
settled
towards
what
airt
i
should
direct
my
steps
but
i
was
not
the
less
determined
to
proceed
and
i
said
to
my
son
who
was
sitting
very
thoughtful
with
the
book
lying
on
the
table
before
him
open
the
bible
and
see
what
the
lord
instructs
us
to
do
at
this
time
and
he
opened
it
and
the
first
words
he
saw
and
read
were
those
of
the
nineteenth
verse
of
the
chapter
of
the
prophet
jeremiah
o
inhabitant
of
aroer
stand
by
the
way
and
espy
ask
him
that
fleeth
and
her
that
escapeth
and
say
what
is
done
so
i
rose
and
bidding
my
son
close
the
book
and
bring
it
with
him
we
went
out
with
our
and
the
blades
still
with
the
about
them
in
our
hands
into
the
street
together
where
we
had
not
long
been
when
a
soldier
on
horseback
passed
us
in
great
haste
and
many
persons
spoke
to
him
as
he
rode
by
inquiring
what
news
he
had
brought
but
he
was
in
trouble
of
mind
and
heeded
them
not
till
he
reached
the
door
of
the
house
where
the
captain
of
the
soldiers
then
in
irvine
was
abiding
when
he
had
gone
into
the
house
and
delivered
his
message
he
returned
to
the
street
where
by
that
time
a
multitude
among
which
we
were
had
assembled
and
he
told
to
the
many
who
inquired
as
it
were
with
one
voice
that
mr
cargill
and
a
numerous
party
of
the
cameronians
had
passed
that
afternoon
through
galston
and
it
was
thought
they
meditated
some
disturbance
on
the
skirts
of
kilmarnock
which
made
the
commander
of
the
king
forces
in
that
town
send
for
aid
to
the
captain
of
those
then
in
irvine
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
news
i
resolved
to
go
that
night
to
kilmarnock
and
abide
with
my
the
widow
of
my
brother
jacob
by
whose
instrumentality
i
thought
we
might
hear
where
the
cameronians
then
were
for
although
i
approved
not
of
their
separation
from
the
general
presbyterian
kirk
of
scotland
nor
was
altogether
content
with
their
declaration
published
at
sanquhar
there
was
yet
one
clause
which
to
my
spirit
impoverished
of
all
hope
was
as
food
and
raiment
and
that
there
may
be
no
perversion
concerning
the
same
in
after
times
i
shall
here
set
down
the
words
of
the
clause
and
the
words
are
these
although
we
be
for
government
and
governors
such
as
the
word
of
god
and
our
covenant
allows
yet
we
for
ourselves
and
all
that
will
adhere
to
us
do
by
thir
presents
disown
charles
stuart
that
has
been
reigning
or
rather
tyrannizing
as
we
may
say
on
the
throne
of
britain
these
years
bygone
as
having
any
right
or
title
to
or
interest
in
the
crown
of
scotland
for
government
he
having
forfeited
the
same
several
years
since
by
his
perjury
and
breach
of
covenant
both
to
god
and
his
kirk
and
further
i
did
approve
of
those
passages
wherein
it
was
declared
that
he
should
have
been
denuded
of
being
king
ruler
or
magistrate
or
having
any
power
to
act
or
to
be
obeyed
as
such
as
also
we
being
under
the
standard
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
captain
of
salvation
do
declare
a
war
with
such
a
tyrant
and
usurper
and
all
the
men
of
his
practices
as
enemies
to
our
lord
accordingly
on
hearing
that
the
excommunicated
and
suffering
society
of
the
cameronians
were
so
near
i
resolved
on
receiving
the
information
and
on
account
of
that
recited
clause
of
the
sanquhar
declaration
to
league
myself
with
them
and
to
fight
in
their
avenging
battles
for
like
me
they
had
endured
irremediable
wrongs
injustice
and
oppressions
from
the
persecutors
and
for
that
cause
had
like
me
abjured
the
doomed
and
papistical
race
of
the
tyrannical
stuarts
with
my
son
therefore
i
went
toward
kilmarnock
in
the
hope
and
with
the
intent
expressed
and
though
the
road
was
five
long
miles
and
though
i
had
not
spoken
more
to
him
all
day
nor
for
days
and
weeks
and
months
before
than
i
have
set
down
herein
we
yet
continued
to
travel
in
silence
the
night
was
bleak
and
the
wind
easterly
but
the
road
was
dry
and
my
thoughts
were
eager
and
we
hastened
onward
and
reached
the
door
without
the
interchange
of
a
word
in
all
the
way
wha
do
ye
want
said
my
son
for
naebody
hae
lived
here
since
the
death
of
aunty
i
was
smote
upon
the
heart
by
these
few
words
as
it
were
with
a
stone
for
it
had
not
come
into
my
mind
to
think
of
inquiring
how
long
the
eclipse
of
my
reason
had
lasted
nor
of
what
had
happened
among
our
friends
in
the
interim
this
shock
however
had
a
salutary
effect
in
staying
the
haste
which
was
still
in
my
thoughts
and
i
conversed
with
my
son
more
collectedly
than
i
could
have
done
before
it
and
he
told
me
of
many
things
very
doleful
to
hear
but
i
was
thankful
to
learn
that
the
end
of
my
brother
widow
had
been
in
peace
and
not
caused
by
any
of
those
grievous
unchances
which
darkened
the
latter
days
of
so
many
of
the
pious
in
that
epoch
of
the
great
displeasure
but
the
disappointment
of
finding
that
death
had
barred
her
door
against
us
made
it
needful
to
seek
a
in
some
public
and
as
it
was
not
prudent
to
carry
our
blades
and
hilts
into
any
such
place
of
promiscuous
resort
we
went
up
the
town
and
hid
them
by
the
in
a
field
at
a
and
then
returning
as
wayfarers
we
entered
a
public
and
bespoke
a
bed
for
the
night
while
we
were
sitting
in
that
house
by
the
kitchen
fire
i
bethought
me
of
the
bible
which
my
son
had
in
his
hand
and
told
him
that
it
would
do
us
good
if
he
would
read
a
chapter
but
just
as
he
was
beginning
the
mistress
said
sirs
dinna
expose
yoursels
for
wha
kens
but
the
enemy
may
come
in
upon
you
it
an
unco
thing
to
be
seen
reading
the
bible
in
a
so
being
thus
admonished
i
bade
my
son
put
away
the
book
and
we
retired
from
the
fireside
and
sat
by
oursels
in
the
shadow
of
a
corner
and
well
it
was
for
us
that
we
did
so
and
a
providential
thing
that
the
worthy
woman
had
been
moved
to
give
us
the
admonition
for
we
were
not
many
minutes
within
the
mirk
and
obscurity
into
which
we
had
removed
when
two
dragoons
who
had
been
skirring
the
country
like
in
pursuit
of
mr
cargill
came
in
and
sat
themselves
down
by
the
fire
being
sorely
tired
with
their
day
hard
riding
they
were
wroth
and
blasphemous
against
all
the
covenanters
for
the
trouble
they
gave
them
and
i
thought
when
i
heard
them
venting
their
bitterness
that
they
spoke
as
with
the
voice
of
the
persecutors
that
were
the
true
cause
of
the
grievances
whereof
they
complained
for
no
doubt
it
was
a
hateful
thing
to
persons
dressed
in
authority
not
to
get
their
own
way
yet
i
could
not
but
wonder
how
it
never
came
into
the
minds
of
such
persons
that
if
they
had
not
trodden
upon
the
worm
it
would
never
have
turned
as
for
the
cameronians
they
were
at
war
with
the
house
of
stuart
and
having
disowned
king
charles
it
was
a
thing
to
be
looked
for
that
all
of
his
sect
and
side
would
be
their
consistent
enemies
so
i
was
none
troubled
by
what
the
soldiers
said
of
them
but
my
spirit
was
chafed
into
the
quick
to
hear
the
remorselessness
of
their
enmity
against
all
the
covenanters
and
presbyterians
respecting
whom
they
swore
with
the
hoarseness
of
revenge
wishing
in
such
a
frightful
manner
the
whole
of
us
in
the
depths
of
perdition
that
i
could
no
longer
hear
them
without
rebuking
their
cruel
hatred
and
most
foul
impiety
chapter
lxxvii
what
gars
you
young
man
said
i
to
the
fiercest
of
the
two
dragoons
an
englisher
what
gars
you
in
that
dreadful
manner
hate
and
blaspheme
honest
men
who
would
if
they
were
permitted
dwell
in
peace
with
all
mankind
permitted
cried
he
turning
round
and
placing
his
chair
between
me
and
the
door
and
who
does
not
permit
them
let
them
seek
the
way
to
heaven
according
to
law
and
no
one
will
trouble
them
the
law
i
thinking
replied
i
very
mildly
is
mair
likely
to
direct
them
to
another
place
here
a
fellow
cried
the
soldier
riotously
laughing
to
his
companion
that
calls
the
king
proclamation
the
devil
i
say
friend
come
a
little
nearer
the
light
is
your
name
cargill
no
replied
i
and
the
light
of
the
fire
then
happening
to
shine
bright
in
his
face
my
son
laid
his
trembling
hand
on
mine
and
whispered
to
me
with
a
faltering
tongue
o
it
one
of
the
villains
that
burnt
our
house
and
what
more
he
added
i
know
not
for
at
the
word
i
leapt
from
my
seat
and
rushed
upon
the
soldier
his
companion
flew
in
between
us
but
the
moment
that
the
criminal
saw
my
son
who
also
sprung
forward
he
uttered
a
fearful
howl
of
horror
and
darted
out
of
the
house
the
other
soldier
was
surprised
but
collected
and
shutting
the
door
to
prevent
us
from
pursuing
or
escaping
said
what
the
devil
this
that
my
father
said
my
son
boldly
ringan
gilhaize
of
quharist
the
dragoon
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
concern
in
his
countenance
and
then
replied
i
have
heard
of
your
name
but
i
was
not
of
the
party
it
was
a
damned
black
job
but
sit
down
ecclesfield
will
not
be
back
he
has
ever
since
of
a
night
been
afraid
of
ghosts
and
he
off
as
if
he
had
seen
one
so
do
disturb
yourself
but
be
cool
i
made
no
answer
nor
could
i
but
i
returned
and
sat
down
in
the
corner
where
we
had
been
sitting
and
my
son
at
the
same
time
took
his
place
beside
me
laying
his
hand
on
mine
and
i
heard
his
heart
beating
but
he
too
said
not
a
word
it
happened
that
none
of
the
people
belonging
to
the
house
were
present
at
the
uproar
but
hearing
the
noise
the
mistress
and
the
gudeman
came
rushing
ben
the
soldier
who
still
stood
calmly
with
his
back
to
the
door
nodded
to
them
to
come
towards
him
which
they
did
and
he
began
to
tell
them
something
in
a
whisper
the
landlord
held
up
his
hands
and
shook
his
head
and
the
mistress
cried
with
tears
in
her
eyes
no
wonder
no
wonder
had
ye
no
better
gang
out
and
see
for
ecclesfield
said
the
landlord
with
a
significant
look
to
the
soldier
the
young
man
cast
his
eyes
down
and
seemed
thoughtful
i
may
be
blamed
said
he
gang
but
the
house
gudewife
and
bring
the
gardivine
resumed
the
gudeman
and
i
saw
him
touch
her
on
the
arm
and
she
immediately
went
again
into
the
room
whence
they
had
issued
come
into
the
fire
jack
windsor
and
sit
down
continued
he
and
the
soldier
with
some
reluctance
quitted
the
door
and
took
his
seat
between
me
and
it
where
ecclesfield
had
been
sitting
ye
ken
jack
he
resumed
when
they
were
seated
that
unless
there
are
two
of
you
present
ye
canna
put
any
man
to
the
test
so
that
every
body
who
has
not
been
tested
is
free
to
go
wheresoever
it
pleasures
himsel
the
dragoon
looked
compassionately
towards
me
and
the
mistress
coming
in
at
the
time
with
a
under
her
arm
and
a
green
dutch
in
her
hand
she
filled
it
with
brandy
and
gave
it
to
her
husband
here
to
you

said
the
landlord
as
he
put
the
glass
to
his
lips
and
i
wish

the
english

england
were
as
orderly
and
as
yoursel
jack
windsor
he
then
held
the
glass
to
the
mistress
and
she
made
it
a
lippy
hae
jack
said
the
landlord
i
sure
after
your
hard
travail
the
day

exclaimed
the
dragoon
i
not
to
be
bribed
by
a
dram
nay
cried
the
landlord
gude
forbid
that
i
should
be
a
briber
still
holding
the
glass
towards
the
soldier
who
sat
in
a
thoughtful
posture
plainly
swithering
that
fellow
ecclesfield
said
he
as
it
were
to
himself
the
up
with
him
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
too
jack
windsor
if
he
does

replied
the
landlord
and
the
dragoon
put
forth
his
hand
and
taking
the
glass
drank
off
the
brandy
it
a
damned
hard
service
this
here
in
scotland
said
windsor
holding
the
empty
glass
in
his
hand
jack
said
the
landlord
and
it
canna
be
a
pleasant
thing
to
a
lad
like
you
jack
windsor
to
be
ravaging
poor
country
folk
only
because

said
the
landlord
but
when

and
he
took
the
glass
from
the
hand
and
held
it
to
his
wife
who
again
filled
it
to
the
flowing
eye
i
should
think
said
the
dragoon
that
ecclesfield
can
not
be
far
off
he
ought
not
to
have
run
away
till
we
had
tested
the
strangers
ah
jack
windsor
replied
the
landlord
holding
out
the
glass
to
him
that
easy
for
you
an
honest
lad
wi
a
clear
conscience
to
say
but
think
o
what
ecclesfield
was
art
and
part
in

thank
your

that

said
the
dragoon
but
the
old
man
was
a
little
so
so
when

replied
the
landlord

replied
the
dragoon
and
there

a
gooder
girl
in
england
nor
a
lady
in
it
that
has
the
bloom
of
sally
windsor
ye
braw
folk
you
englishers
and
ye
happy
folk
whilk

said
the
landlord
presenting
the
second
glass
which
jack
drank
off
at
once
and
returned
to
the
mistress
signifying
with
his
hand
that
he
wanted
no
more
upon
which
she
retired
with
the
gardivine
while
the
landlord
continued
it
weel
for
you
in
the
south
yonder
jack
that
your
prelates
do
not
harass
honest
folk
we
have
no
prelates
in
england
thank

said
the
dragoon
we
would
have
our
parsons
are
other
sort
o
things
i
thought
ye
had
an
host
o
bishops
jack
said
the
landlord
true
and
good
fellows
some
on
are
but
though
prelates
be
bishops
bishops
ai
prelates
which
makes
a
difference
and
a
blessed
difference
it
is
for
how
would
ye
like
to
hear
of
your
father
house
being
burnt
and
him
in
prison
and
your
bonny
innocent
sister
eh
is
nae
that
ecclesfield
foot
clampering
wi
his
spurs
at
the
door
the
dragoon
listened
again
and
looked
thoughtful
for
a
little
time
and
turned
his
eyes
hastily
towards
the
corner
where
we
were
sitting
the
landlord
eyed
him
anxiously
yes
cried
the
poor
fellow
starting
from
his
seat
and
striking
his
closed
right
hand
sharply
into
his
left
yes
i
ought
and
i
will
adding
calmly
to
the
landlord
confound
ecclesfield
where
the
devil
is
he
gone
i
go
see
and
he
instantly
went
out
the
moment
he
had
left
the
kitchen
the
landlord
rose
and
said
to
us
flee
flee
and
quit
this
dangerous
town
whereupon
we
rose
hastily
and
my
son
lifting
the
bible
which
he
had
laid
in
the
darkness
of
the
corner
we
instanter
left
the
house
and
notwithstanding
the
speed
that
was
in
our
steps
as
we
hurried
up
the
street
i
had
a
glimpse
of
the
compassionate
soldier
standing
at
the
corner
of
the
house
when
we
ran
by
thus
in
a
very
extraordinary
manner
was
the
dreadful
woe
that
had
befallen
me
and
mine
most
wonderfully
made
a
mean
through
the
conscience
of
ecclesfield
to
effectuate
our
escape
chapter
lxxviii
on
leaving
the
public
we
went
straight
to
the
place
where
our
blades
and
belts
lay
and
took
them
up
and
proceeded
in
an
easterly
direction
but
i
soon
found
that
i
was
no
longer
the
man
i
had
once
been
suffering
and
the
fever
of
my
frenzy
had
impaired
my
strength
and
the
weight
of
years
was
on
my
back
so
that
i
began
to
weary
for
a
place
of
rest
for
the
night
and
i
looked
often
around
to
discover
the
star
of
any
window
but
all
was
dark
and
the
bleak
easterly
wind
searched
my
very
bones
even
my
son
whose
sturdy
health
and
youthy
blood
made
him
abler
to
thole
the
night
air
complained
of
the
nipping
cold
many
a
time
yet
when
i
remember
that
night
do
i
think
with
wonder
and
reverence
of
our
condition
an
infirm
man
with
a
deranged
head
and
a
broken
heart
going
forth
amidst
the
winter
wind
with
a
little
boy
not
passing
thirteen
years
of
age
to
pull
down
from
his
throne
the
guarded
king
of
three
mighty
kingdoms
and
we
did
it
such
was
the
doom
of
avenging
justice
and
such
the
pleasure
of
heaven
but
let
me
proceed
to
rehearse
the
trials
i
was
required
to
undergo
before
the
accomplishment
of
that
high
predestination
weary
as
i
have
said
very
cold
and
disconsolate
we
walked
hirpling
together
for
some
time
at
last
we
heard
the
rumbling
of
wheels
before
us
and
my
son
running
forward
came
back
and
told
me
it
was
a
carrier
i
hastened
on
and
with
a
great
satisfaction
found
it
was
robin
brown
the
ayr
and
kilmarnock
carrier
i
had
known
him
well
for
many
years
and
surely
it
was
a
providential
thing
that
we
met
him
in
our
distress
for
he
was
the
brother
of
a
godly
man
on
whose
head
while
his
family
were
around
him
claverhouse
with
his
own
bloody
hands
placed
the
glorious
diadem
of
martyrdom
he
had
been
told
what
had
befallen
me
and
mine
and
was
greatly
amazed
to
hear
my
voice
and
that
i
was
again
come
to
myself
and
he
helped
both
my
son
and
me
into
the
cart
and
as
he
walked
by
the
wheel
he
told
me
of
many
things
which
had
happened
during
my
eclipse
and
of
the
dreadful
executions
at
edinburgh
of
the
prisoners
taken
at
airsmoss
and
how
that
papist
james
stuart
duke
of
york
the
king
brother
was
placed
at
the
head
of
the
scottish
councils
and
was
then
rioting
in
the
delights
of
cruelty
with
the
use
of
the
torture
and
the
thumbikins
upon
prisoners
suspected
or
accused
of
being
honest
to
their
vows
and
their
religious
profession
but
my
mind
was
unsettled
and
his
tale
of
calamity
passed
over
it
like
the
east
wind
that
blew
that
night
so
freezingly
cruel
to
the
sense
at
the
time
but
of
which
the
morrow
showed
no
memorial
i
said
nothing
to
robin
brown
of
what
my
intent
was
but
that
i
was
on
my
way
to
join
the
cameronians
if
i
knew
where
they
might
be
found
and
he
informed
me
that
after
the
raid
of
airsmoss
they
had
scattered
themselves
into
the
south
country
where
as
claverhouse
had
the
chief
command
the
number
of
their
friends
was
likely
to
be
daily
increased
by
the
natural
issue
of
his
cruelties
and
that
vindictive
exasperation
which
was
a
passion
and
an
affection
of
his
mind
for
the
discomfiture
he
had
met
with
at
drumclog
but
said
the
worthy
man
i
hope
ringan
gilhaize
ye
yet
consider
the
step
before
ye
tak
it
ye
no
at
this
time
in
a
condition
health
to
warsle
wi
hardship
and
your
laddie
there
owre
young
to
be
o
ony
fek
in
the
way
o
war
for
ye
ken
the
cameronians
hae
war
against
the
king
and
being
few
and
far
apart
they
hunted
down
in
a
places
if
i
canna
fight
wi
men
replied
my
brave
stripling
i
can
help
my
father
but
i
no
david
was
but
a
herd
laddie
maybe
nae
aulder
nor
bigger
than
me
when
he
the
muckle
philistine
wi
a
stane
i
made
no
answer
myself
to
robin
brown
remonstrance
because
my
resolution
was
girded
as
it
were
with
a
gir
of
brass
and
adamant
and
therefore
to
reason
more
or
farther
concerning
aught
but
of
the
means
to
achieve
my
purpose
was
a
thing
i
could
not
abide
only
i
said
to
him
that
being
weary
and
not
in
my
wonted
health
i
would
try
to
compose
myself
to
sleep
and
he
would
waken
me
when
he
thought
fit
for
that
i
would
not
go
with
him
to
glasgow
but
shape
our
way
towards
the
south
country
so
i
stretched
myself
out
and
my
dear
son
laid
himself
at
my
back
and
the
worthy
man
happing
us
with
his
plaid
we
soon
fell
asleep
when
the
cart
stopped
at
the
kingswell
where
robin
was
in
the
usage
of
halting
half
an
hour
he
awoke
us
and
there
being
no
strangers
in
the
house
we
alighted
and
going
in
warmed
ourselves
at
the
fire
out
of
a
compassion
for
me
the
mistress
warmed
and
spiced
a
pint
of
ale
but
instead
of
doing
me
any
good
i
had
not
long
partaken
of
the
same
when
i
experienced
a
great
coldness
and
a
trembling
in
my
limbs
in
so
much
that
i
felt
myself
very
ill
and
prayed
the
kind
woman
to
allow
me
to
lie
down
in
a
bed
which
she
consented
to
do
in
a
most
charitable
manner
causing
her
husband
who
was
a
covenanted
man
as
i
afterwards
found
to
rise
out
of
his
and
give
me
their
own
the
cold
and
the
tremblings
were
but
the
symptoms
and
beginnings
of
a
sore
malady
which
soon
rose
to
such
a
head
that
robin
brown
taiglet
more
than
two
hours
for
me
but
still
i
grew
worse
and
worse
and
could
not
be
removed
for
many
days
on
the
fifth
i
was
brought
so
nigh
unto
the
gates
of
death
that
my
son
who
never
left
the
thought
at
one
time
i
had
been
released
from
my
troubles
but
i
was
reserved
for
the
task
that
the
lord
had
in
store
for
me
and
from
that
time
i
began
to
recover
and
nothing
could
exceed
the
tenderness
wherewith
i
was
treated
by
those
samaritan
christians
the
landlord
and
his
wife
of
the
public
at
kingswell
this
distemper
however
left
a
great
imbecility
of
body
behind
it
and
i
wondered
whether
it
could
be
of
providence
to
prevent
me
from
going
forward
with
my
avenging
purpose
against
charles
stuart
and
his
counsellors
being
one
day
in
this
frame
of
dubiety
lying
in
the
bed
and
my
son
sitting
at
my
pillow
i
said
to
him
get
the
book
and
open
and
read
which
he
accordingly
did
and
the
first
verse
that
he
cast
his
eye
upon
was
the
of
the
seventh
chapter
of
isaiah
with
arrows
and
with
bows
shall
men
come
stop
said
i
and
go
to
the
window
and
see
who
are
coming
but
when
he
went
thither
and
looked
out
he
could
see
no
one
far
nor
near
yet
still
i
heard
the
tramp
of
many
feet
and
i
said
to
him
assuredly
joseph
there
are
many
persons
coming
towards
this
house
and
i
think
they
are
not
men
of
war
for
their
steps
are
loose
and
they
march
not
in
the
order
of
battle
this
i
have
thought
was
a
wonderful
sharpness
of
hearing
with
which
i
was
for
a
season
then
gifted
for
soon
after
a
crowd
of
persons
were
discovered
coming
over
the
moor
towards
the
house
and
it
proved
to
be
mr
cargill
with
about
some
sixty
of
the
cameronians
who
had
been
hunted
from
out
their
in
the
south
chapter
lxxix
it
is
surely
a
most
strange
matter
that
whenever
i
come
to
think
and
to
write
of
the
events
of
that
period
and
of
my
sickness
at
kingswell
my
thoughts
relapse
into
infirmity
and
all
which
then
passed
move
as
it
were
before
me
in
mist
disorderly
and
fantastical
but
wherefore
need
i
thus
descant
of
my
own
estate
when
so
many
things
of
the
highest
concernment
are
pressing
upon
my
tablets
for
registration
be
it
therefore
enough
that
i
mention
here
how
much
i
was
refreshed
by
the
prayers
of
mr
cargill
who
was
brought
into
my
where
he
wrestled
with
great
efficacy
for
my
recovery
and
that
after
he
had
made
an
end
i
felt
so
much
strengthened
that
i
caused
myself
to
be
raised
from
my
bed
and
placed
in
a
chair
at
the
open
window
that
i
might
see
the
men
who
had
been
heartened
from
on
high
by
the
sense
of
their
sufferings
to
proclaim
war
against
the
king
our
common
foe
they
were
scattered
before
the
house
to
the
number
of
more
than
fifty
some
sitting
on
stones
others
stretched
on
the
heather
and
a
few
walking
about
by
themselves
ruminating
on
mournful
fancies
their
appearance
was
a
thought
wild
and
raised
their
beards
had
not
been
shaven
for
many
a
day
their
apparel
was
also
much
rent
and
they
had
all
endured
great
misfortunes
in
their
families
and
substance
their
homes
had
been
made
desolate
some
had
seen
their
sons
put
to
death
and
not
a
few
the
ruin
of
their
innocent
daughters
and
the
virtuous
wives
of
their
bosoms
all
by
the
fruit
of
laws
and
edicts
which
had
issued
from
the
councils
of
charles
stuart
and
were
enforced
by
men
drunken
with
the
authority
of
his
arbitrary
will
but
though
my
spirit
clove
to
theirs
and
was
in
unison
with
their
intent
i
could
not
but
doubt
of
so
poor
a
handful
of
forlorn
men
though
it
be
written
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift
nor
the
battle
to
the
strong
and
i
called
to
my
son
to
bring
me
the
book
that
i
might
be
instructed
from
the
word
what
i
ought
at
that
time
to
do
and
when
he
had
done
so
i
opened
it
and
the
chapter
of
genesis
met
my
eye
and
i
was
awed
and
trembled
and
my
heart
was
melted
with
sadness
and
an
agonising
grief
for
the
command
to
abraham
to
sacrifice
isaac
his
only
son
whom
he
so
loved
on
the
mountains
in
the
land
of
moriah
required
of
me
to
part
with
my
son
and
to
send
him
with
the
cameronians
and
i
prayed
with
a
weeping
spirit
and
the
imploring
silence
of
a
parent
heart
that
the
lord
would
be
pleased
not
to
put
my
faith
to
so
great
a
trial
i
took
the
book
again
and
i
opened
it
a
second
time
and
the
command
of
the
sacred
oracle
was
presented
to
me
in
the
fifth
verse
of
the
fifth
chapter
of
ecclesiastes
better
is
it
that
thou
shouldest
not
vow
than
that
thou
shouldest
vow
and
not
pay
but
still
the
man
and
the
father
were
powerful
with
my
soul
and
the
weakness
of
disease
was
in
me
and
i
called
my
son
towards
me
and
i
bowed
my
head
upon
his
hands
as
he
stood
before
me
and
wept
very
bitterly
and
pressed
him
to
my
bosom
and
was
loath
to
send
him
away
he
knew
not
what
caused
the
struggle
wherewith
he
saw
me
so
moved
and
he
became
touched
with
fear
lest
my
reason
was
again
going
from
me
but
i
dried
my
eyes
and
told
him
it
was
not
so
and
that
maybe
i
would
be
better
if
i
could
compose
myself
to
read
a
chapter
so
i
again
opened
the
volume
and
the
third
command
was
in
the
verse
of
the
eight
chapter
of
st
matthew
why
are
ye
fearful
o
ye
of
little
faith
but
still
notwithstanding
my
rebellious
heart
would
not
consent
and
i
cried
i
am
a
poor
infirm
desolate
and
destitute
man
and
he
is
all
that
is
left
me
o
that
mine
eyes
were
closed
in
death
and
that
this
head
which
sorrow
and
care
and
much
misery
have
made
untimely
grey
were
laid
on
its
cold
pillow
and
the
green
curtain
of
the
still
kirk
yard
were
drawn
around
me
in
my
last
long
sleep
then
again
the
softness
of
a
mother
fondness
came
upon
my
heart
and
i
grasped
the
wondering
stripling
hands
in
mine
and
shook
them
saying
but
it
must
be
so
it
is
the
lord
will
thrice
has
he
commanded
and
i
dare
not
rebel
thrice
what
has
he
commanded
father
said
the
boy
what
is
his
will
for
ye
ken
it
maun
be
done
read
said
i
the
chapter
of
genesis
i
ke
father
it
about
abraham
and
wee
isaac
but
though
ye
tak
me
into
the
land
of
moriah
and
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
maybe
a
ram
will
be
catched
by
the
horns
in
a
for
the
and
no
hae
ony
need
to
kill
me
at
that
moment
mr
cargill
came
again
into
the
room
to
bid
me
farewell
but
seeing
my
son
standing
with
a
tear
of
simplicity
in
his
eye
and
me
in
the
weakness
of
my
infirm
estate
weeping
upon
his
hands
he
stopped
and
inquired
what
then
had
so
moved
us
whereupon
i
looked
towards
him
and
said
when
i
was
taken
with
the
malady
that
has
thus
changed
the
man
in
me
to
more
than
the
gentleness
of
woman
ye
ken
as
i
have
already
told
you
we
were
bowne
to
seek
your
folk
out
and
to
fight
on
your
side
but
when
i
beheld
your
dejected
and
host
a
doubt
came
to
me
that
surely
it
could
not
be
that
the
lord
intended
through
them
to
bring
about
the
deliverance
of
the
land
and
under
this
doubt
as
to
what
i
should
now
do
and
my
limbs
being
moreover
still
in
the
fetters
of
sickness
i
consulted
the
oracle
of
god
and
what
has
been
the
answer
it
has
instructed
me
to
send
my
son
with
you
but
o
it
is
a
terrible
probation
you
have
done
well
my
friend
replied
the
godly
man
to
seek
advice
from
the
word
but
apply
again
and
maybe
maybe
ringan
ye
no
be
put
to
so
great
a
trial
to
this
i
could
only
say
alas
sir
twice
have
i
again
consulted
the
oracle
and
twice
has
the
answer
been
an
exhortation
and
a
reproach
that
i
should
be
so
loath
to
obey
but
what
for
father
interposed
my
son
need
ye
be
sae
fashed
about
it
i
would
refuse
i
ready
to
gang
if
ye
were
na
sae
weakly
and
though
the
folk
afore
the
house
are
but
a
wee
ye
ken
it
is
written
in
the
book
that
the
race
is
not
to
the
swift
nor
the
battle
to
the
strong
mr
cargill
looked
with
admiration
at
the
confidence
of
this
young
piety
and
laying
his
hand
on
the
boy
head
said
i
have
not
found
so
great
faith
no
not
in
israel
the
lord
is
in
this
ringan
put
your
trust
in
him
whereupon
i
took
my
son
hand
and
i
placed
it
in
the
martyr
hand
and
i
said
take
him
lead
him
wheresoever
ye
will
i
have
sinned
almost
to
disobedience
but
the
confidence
has
been
renewed
within
me
rejoice
said
mr
cargill
in
words
that
were
as
the
gift
of
health
to
my
enfeebled
spirit
rejoice
and
be
exceeding
glad
for
great
is
your
reward
in
heaven
for
so
persecuted
they
the
prophets
which
were
before
you
as
he
pronounced
the
latter
clause
i
felt
my
thoughts
flash
with
a
wild
remembrance
of
the
desolation
of
my
house
but
he
began
to
return
thanks
for
the
comfort
that
he
himself
enjoyed
in
his
outcast
condition
of
beholding
so
many
proofs
of
the
unshaken
constancy
of
faith
still
in
the
land
and
prayed
for
me
in
words
of
such
sweet
eloquence
that
even
in
the
parting
from
my
son
my
last
whom
i
loved
so
well
they
cherished
me
with
a
joy
passing
all
understanding
at
the
conclusion
of
his
inspired
thanksgiving
i
kissed
my
joseph
on
the
forehead
and
bidding
him
remember
what
his
father
house
had
been
bade
him
farewell
his
young
heart
was
too
full
to
reply
and
mr
cargill
too
was
so
deeply
affected
that
he
said
nothing
so
after
shaking
me
by
the
hand
he
led
him
away
and
if
i
did
sin
when
they
were
departed
in
the
complaint
of
my
childless
desolation
for
no
less
could
i
account
it
it
was
a
sin
that
surely
will
not
be
heavily
laid
against
me
o
absalom
my
son
my
son
would
i
had
died
for
thee
cried
the
warlike
king
david
when
absalom
was
slain
in
rebellion
against
him
and
he
had
still
many
children
but
my
innocent
absalom
was
all
that
i
had
left
chapter
lxxx
during
the
season
that
the
malady
continued
upon
me
through
the
unsuspected
agency
of
robin
brown
a
paction
was
entered
into
with
certain
of
my
neighbours
to
take
the
lands
of
quharist
on
tack
among
them
and
to
pay
me
a
secret
stipend
by
which
means
were
obtained
to
maintain
me
in
a
decency
when
i
was
able
to
be
removed
into
glasgow
and
when
my
strength
was
so
far
restored
that
i
could
bear
the
journey
the
same
good
man
entered
into
a
stipulation
with
mrs
aird
the
relict
of
a
gospel
minister
to
receive
me
as
a
lodger
and
he
carried
me
in
on
his
cart
to
her
house
at
the
foot
of
the
stockwell
with
that
excellent
person
i
continued
several
months
unmolested
but
without
hearing
any
tidings
of
my
son
afflicting
tales
were
however
of
frequent
occurrence
concerning
the
rigour
wherewith
the
cameronians
were
hunted
so
that
what
with
anxiety
and
the
backwardness
of
nature
to
rally
in
ailments
ayont
fifty
i
continued
to
languish
incapable
of
doing
anything
in
furtherance
of
the
vow
of
vengeance
that
i
had
vowed
nor
should
i
suppress
that
in
my
infirmity
there
was
often
a
wildness
about
my
thoughts
by
which
i
was
unfitted
at
times
to
hold
communion
with
other
men
on
these
occasions
i
sat
wondering
if
the
things
around
me
were
not
the
substanceless
imageries
of
a
dream
and
fancying
that
those
terrible
truths
whereof
i
can
yet
only
trust
myself
to
hint
might
be
the
fallacies
of
a
diseased
sleep
and
i
contested
as
it
were
with
the
reality
of
all
that
i
saw
touched
and
felt
and
struggled
like
one
oppressed
with
an
incubus
that
i
might
awake
and
find
myself
again
at
quharist
in
the
midst
of
my
family
at
other
times
i
felt
all
the
loneliness
of
the
solitude
into
which
my
lot
was
then
cast
and
it
was
in
vain
that
i
tried
to
appease
my
craving
affections
with
the
thought
that
in
parting
with
my
son
i
had
given
him
to
the
lord
i
durst
not
say
to
myself
there
was
aught
of
frenzy
in
that
consecration
but
when
i
heard
of
cameronians
shot
on
the
hills
or
brought
to
the
scaffold
i
prayed
that
i
might
receive
some
token
of
an
accepted
offering
in
what
i
had
done
sterner
feelings
too
had
their
turns
of
predominance
i
recalled
the
manifold
calamities
which
withered
my
native
land
the
guilty
provocations
that
the
people
had
received
the
merciless
avarice
and
rapacious
profligacy
that
had
ruined
so
many
worthies
the
crimes
that
had
scattered
so
many
families
and
the
contempt
with
which
all
our
wrongs
and
woes
were
regarded
and
then
i
would
remember
my
avenging
vow
and
supplicate
for
health
at
last
one
day
mrs
aird
who
had
been
out
on
some
household
cares
returned
home
in
great
distress
of
mind
telling
me
that
the
soldiers
had
got
hold
of
mr
cargill
and
had
brought
him
into
the
town
this
happened
about
the
ninth
or
tenth
of
july
in
the
afternoon
and
the
day
being
very
sultry
the
heat
had
oppressed
me
with
langour
and
i
was
all
day
as
one
laden
with
sleep
but
no
sooner
had
mrs
aird
told
me
this
than
i
felt
the
langour
depart
from
me
as
if
a
cumbrous
cloak
had
been
taken
away
and
i
rose
up
a
recruited
and
reanimated
man
it
was
so
much
the
end
of
my
debility
of
body
and
sorrowing
of
mind
that
she
was
loquacious
with
her
surprise
when
she
saw
me
as
it
were
with
a
miraculous
restoration
prepare
myself
to
go
out
in
order
to
learn
if
possible
some
account
of
my
son
when
however
i
went
into
the
street
and
saw
a
crowd
gathered
around
the
my
heart
failed
me
a
little
not
for
fear
but
because
the
shouts
of
the
multitude
were
like
the
yells
and
derisions
of
insult
and
i
thought
they
were
poured
upon
the
holy
sufferer
it
was
not
however
so
the
people
of
glasgow
were
notwithstanding
their
prelatic
thraldom
moved
far
otherwise
and
their
shouts
and
scoffings
were
against
a
townsman
of
their
own
who
had
reviled
the
man
of
god
on
seeing
him
a
prisoner
among
the
soldiers
in
the
not
then
knowing
this
i
halted
dubious
if
i
should
go
forward
and
while
standing
in
a
swither
at
the
corner
of
the
stockwell
a
cart
came
up
from
the
bridge
driven
by
a
stripling
i
saw
that
the
cart
and
horse
were
robin
brown
and
before
i
had
time
to
look
around
my
son
had
me
by
the
hand
we
said
little
but
rejoiced
to
see
each
other
again
i
observed
however
that
his
apparel
was
become
old
and
that
his
eyes
were
grown
quick
and
eager
like
those
of
the
hunted
cameronians
whom
i
saw
at
kingswell
we
hae
robin
brown
cart
frae
him
said
he
that
i
might
come
unjealoused
into
the
town
to
hear
what
to
be
done
wi
the
minister
but
i
maun
tak
it
back
the
night
and
maybe
we
fa
in
thegither
again
when
i
hae
done
my
errand
with
that
he
parted
from
me
and
giving
the
horse
a
touch
with
his
whip
drove
it
along
towards
the
whistling
like
a
blithe
country
lad
that
had
no
care
as
soon
as
he
had
so
left
me
i
went
back
to
mrs
aird
and
providing
myself
with
what
money
i
had
in
the
house
i
went
to
a
shop
and
bought
certain
articles
of
apparel
which
having
made
up
into
a
bundle
i
requested
the
better
to
disguise
my
intent
the
merchant
to
carry
it
himself
to
robin
brown
the
ayr
carrier
cart
and
give
it
to
the
lad
who
was
with
it
to
take
to
joseph
gilhaize
a
thing
easy
to
be
done
both
the
horse
and
cart
being
well
known
in
those
days
to
the
chief
merchants
then
in
glasgow
when
i
had
done
this
i
went
to
the
bridge
and
leaning
over
it
looked
into
the
peaceful
flowing
tide
and
there
waited
for
nearly
an
hour
before
i
saw
my
son
returning
and
when
at
last
he
came
i
could
perceive
as
he
was
approaching
that
he
did
not
wish
i
should
speak
to
him
while
at
the
same
time
he
edged
towards
me
and
in
passing
said
as
it
were
to
himself
the
bundle
safe
and
he
for
edinburgh
by
which
i
knew
that
the
apparel
i
had
bought
for
him
was
in
his
hands
and
that
he
had
learnt
mr
cargill
was
to
be
sent
to
edinburgh
this
latter
circumstance
however
opened
to
me
a
new
light
with
respect
to
the
cameronians
and
i
guessed
that
they
had
friends
in
the
town
with
whom
they
were
in
secret
correspondence
but
alas
the
espionage
was
not
all
on
their
part
as
i
very
soon
was
taught
to
know
by
experience
though
the
interviews
with
joseph
my
son
passed
as
i
have
herein
narrated
they
had
not
escaped
observance
for
some
time
before
though
i
was
seen
but
as
i
was
an
invalid
man
somewhat
unsettled
in
his
mind
there
were
persons
who
marvelled
wherefore
it
was
that
i
dwelt
in
such
sequestration
with
mrs
aird
and
their
marvelling
set
the
espial
of
the
prelacy
upon
me
and
it
so
fell
out
that
some
of
those
evil
persons
who
for
hire
or
malice
had
made
themselves
the
beagles
of
the
persecutors
happened
to
notice
the
manner
in
which
my
son
came
up
to
me
when
he
entered
the
city
driving
robert
brown
cart
and
they
jealoused
somewhat
of
the
truth
they
followed
him
unsuspected
and
saw
in
what
manner
he
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
they
traced
him
returning
out
of
the
town
with
seemingly
no
other
cause
for
having
come
into
it
than
to
receive
the
little
store
of
apparel
that
i
had
provided
for
him
this
was
ground
enough
to
justify
any
molestation
against
us
and
accordingly
the
same
night
i
was
arrested
and
carried
next
morning
to
edinburgh
the
cruel
officers
would
have
forced
me
to
walk
with
the
soldiers
but
every
one
who
beheld
my
pale
face
and
emaciated
frame
cried
out
against
it
and
a
cart
was
allowed
to
me
on
reaching
edinburgh
i
was
placed
in
the
tolbooth
where
many
other
sufferers
for
the
cause
of
the
gospel
were
then
lying
it
was
a
foul
and
an
unwholesome
den
many
of
the
guiltless
inmates
were
so
wasted
that
they
were
rather
like
frightful
effigies
of
death
than
living
men
their
skins
were
yellow
and
their
hands
were
roped
and
warpt
with
veins
and
sinews
in
a
manner
very
awful
to
see
their
eyes
were
vivid
with
a
strange
distemperature
and
there
was
a
anatomy
in
the
melancholy
with
which
they
welcomed
a
new
brother
in
affliction
that
made
me
feel
when
i
entered
among
them
as
if
i
had
come
into
the
dark
abode
of
spectres
and
manes
and
dismal
shadows
the
prison
was
crowded
and
though
life
was
to
many
not
worth
the
care
of
preservation
they
yet
esteemed
it
as
the
gift
of
their
maker
and
as
such
considered
it
their
duty
to
prolong
for
his
sake
it
was
therefore
a
rule
with
them
to
stand
in
successive
bands
at
the
windows
in
order
that
they
might
taste
of
the
living
air
from
without
and
knowing
from
dismal
experience
that
those
who
came
in
the
last
suffered
at
first
more
than
those
who
were
before
it
was
a
charitable
among
them
to
allow
to
such
a
longer
period
of
the
window
their
only
solace
thus
it
was
that
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
i
had
been
immured
in
that
doleful
place
i
was
standing
with
several
others
behind
a
party
of
those
who
were
in
possession
of
the
enjoyment
in
order
that
we
might
take
their
places
when
the
hour
expired
and
while
we
were
thus
awaiting
in
patience
the
tedious
elapse
of
the
weary
moments
a
noise
was
heard
in
the
streets
as
of
the
approach
of
a
multitude
there
was
something
in
the
coming
sound
of
that
tumult
unlike
the
noise
of
any
other
multitude
ever
and
anon
a
feeble
shouting
and
then
the
roll
of
a
drum
but
the
general
sough
was
a
murmur
of
horror
followed
by
a
rushing
as
if
the
people
were
scared
by
some
dreadful
sight
the
noise
grew
louder
and
nearer
and
hoarse
bursts
of
aversion
and
anger
mingled
with
lamentations
were
distinctly
heard
every
one
in
the
prison
pressed
to
the
window
wondering
what
hideous
procession
could
occasion
the
expression
of
such
contrarious
feelings
in
the
populace
and
all
eager
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
dismal
pageant
expecting
that
it
was
some
devoted
victim
who
according
to
the
practice
of
the
time
was
treated
as
a
sentenced
criminal
even
as
he
was
conveyed
to
his
trial
what
do
you
see
said
i
to
one
of
the
prisoners
who
clung
to
the
bars
of
iron
with
which
the
window
near
where
i
stood
was
grated
and
who
thereby
saw
farther
down
the
street
i
can
see
but
the
crowd
coming
said
he
and
every
one
is
looking
as
if
he
grewed
at
something
not
yet
in
sight
at
that
moment
and
while
he
was
speaking
there
was
a
sudden
silence
in
the
street
what
has
happened
said
one
of
the
sufferers
near
me
my
heart
beat
so
wildly
that
i
would
not
myself
inquire
they
have
stopped
was
the
answer
but
now
they
come
i
see
the
magistrates
their
guard
is
before
them
the
provost
is
first
they
are
coming
two
and
two
and
they
look
very
sorrowful
are
there
but
the
magistrates
said
i
making
an
effort
to
press
in
closer
to
the
window
aye
now
it
is
at
hand
said
the
man
who
was
clinging
to
the
grating
of
the
window
the
soldiers
are
marching
on
each
side
i
see
the
prisoners
their
hands
are
tied
behind
ilk
loaded
wi
a
goad
of
iron
they
are
bareheaded
ane
twa
three
four
five
they
are
five
men
they
are
cameronians
said
i
somewhat
released
i
know
not
wherefore
unless
it
was
because
he
spoke
of
no
youth
being
among
them
hush
said
he
here
is
another
he
is
on
horseback
i
see
the
head
oh
the
sufferer
is
an
old
minister
his
head
is
uncovered
he
is
placed
with
his
face
to
the
horse
tail
his
hands
are
tied
and
his
feet
are
fastened
with
a
rope
beneath
the
hush
they
are
passing
under
the
window
at
that
moment
a
shriek
of
horror
rose
from
all
then
looking
out
and
every
one
recoiled
from
the
window
in
the
same
instant
a
bloody
head
on
a
halbert
was
held
up
to
i
looked
i
saw
the
ghastly
features
and
i
would
have
kissed
those
lifeless
lips
for
o
they
were
my
son
chapter
lxxxi
i
had
laid
that
son
my
only
son
whom
i
so
loved
on
the
altar
of
the
covenant
an
offering
unto
the
lord
but
still
i
did
hope
that
maybe
it
would
be
according
to
the
mercy
of
wisdom
that
he
would
provide
a
lamb
in
the
bush
for
the
sacrifice
and
when
the
stripling
had
parted
from
me
i
often
felt
as
the
mother
feels
when
the
milk
of
love
is
in
her
bosom
and
her
babe
no
longer
there
i
shall
not
however
here
relate
how
my
soul
was
wounded
at
yon
sight
nor
ask
the
courteous
reader
to
conceive
with
what
agony
i
exclaimed
wherefore
was
it
lord
that
i
was
commanded
to
do
that
unfruitful
thing
for
in
that
very
moment
the
cry
of
my
failing
faith
was
rebuked
and
the
mystery
of
the
required
sacrifice
was
brought
into
wonderful
effect
manifesting
that
it
was
for
no
light
purpose
i
had
been
so
tried
my
who
hung
by
the
bars
of
the
was
like
the
other
witnesses
so
shaken
by
the
woful
spectacle
that
he
suddenly
jerked
himself
aside
to
avoid
the
sight
and
by
that
action
the
weight
of
his
body
loosened
the
bar
so
that
when
the
pageantry
of
horrors
had
passed
by
he
felt
it
move
in
his
grip
and
he
told
us
that
surely
providence
had
an
invisible
hand
in
the
bloody
scene
for
by
the
loosening
of
that
stancher
a
mean
was
given
whereby
we
might
all
escape
accordingly
it
was
agreed
that
as
soon
as
the
night
closed
over
the
world
we
should
join
our
strengths
together
to
bend
the
bar
from
its
socket
in
the
lintel
and
then
it
was
i
told
them
that
what
they
had
seen
was
the
last
relic
of
my
martyred
family
and
we
made
ourselves
wroth
with
the
recital
of
our
several
wrongs
for
all
there
had
endured
the
scourge
of
the
persecutors
and
we
took
each
other
by
the
hand
and
swore
a
dreadful
oath
never
to
desist
in
our
endeavours
till
we
had
wrenched
the
sceptre
from
the
tyrannical
grasp
of
the
stuarts
and
broken
it
into
pieces
for
ever
and
we
burst
into
a
wild
strain
of
complaint
and
clamour
calling
on
the
blood
of
our
murdered
friends
to
mount
with
our
cries
to
the
gates
of
heaven
and
we
sang
as
it
were
with
the
voices
of
the
angry
waters
and
the
winds
the
hundred
and
ninth
psalm
and
at
the
end
of
every
verse
we
joined
our
hands
crying
upon
charles
and
james
stuart
and
all
their
guilty
line
o
lord
let
it
be
done
and
a
vast
multitude
gathered
around
the
prison
and
the
lamentations
of
many
without
was
a
chorus
in
unison
with
the
dismal
song
of
our
vengeance
and
despair
at
last
the
shadows
of
the
twilight
began
to
darken
in
the
town
and
the
lights
of
the
windows
were
to
us
as
the
courses
of
the
stars
of
that
sky
which
from
our
prison
chamber
could
not
be
seen
we
watched
their
progress
from
the
earliest
yellow
glimmering
of
the
lamp
in
the
darksome
wynd
till
the
last
little
twinkling
light
in
the
dwelling
of
the
widow
that
sits
and
sighs
companionless
with
her
distaff
in
the
summits
of
the
city
and
we
continued
our
vigil
till
they
were
all
one
by
one
extinguished
save
only
the
candles
at
the
bedsides
of
the
dying
then
we
twined
a
portion
of
our
clothes
into
a
rope
and
having
fastened
it
to
the
iron
bar
soon
drew
it
from
its
place
in
the
stone
but
just
as
we
were
preparing
to
take
it
in
by
some
accident
it
fell
into
the
street
the
panic
which
this
caused
prevented
us
from
attempting
any
thing
more
at
that
time
for
a
sentinel
walked
his
rounds
on
the
outside
of
the
tolbooth
and
we
could
not
but
think
he
must
have
heard
the
noise
a
sullen
despair
in
consequence
entered
into
many
of
our
hearts
and
we
continued
for
the
remainder
of
the
night
silent
but
though
others
were
then
shaken
in
their
faith
mine
was
now
confident
i
saw
by
what
had
happened
in
the
moment
of
my
remonstrance
that
there
was
some
great
deliverance
in
reservation
so
i
sat
apart
by
myself
and
i
spent
the
night
in
inward
thanksgiving
for
what
had
been
already
done
nor
was
this
confidence
long
without
its
reward
in
the
morning
a
brother
of
one
of
my
coming
to
condole
with
him
it
being
generally
reported
that
we
were
all
doomed
to
die
he
happened
to
see
the
bar
lying
on
the
street
and
taking
it
up
hid
it
till
he
had
gone
into
a
shop
and
provided
himself
with
a
cord
he
then
hastened
to
us
gave
us
the
cord
and
making
what
speed
he
could
brought
the
iron
in
his
plaid
and
we
having
lowered
the
string
from
the
window
he
fastened
the
bar
to
it
and
we
drew
it
up
undiscovered
and
reset
it
in
its
place
by
which
the
defect
could
not
be
seen
by
any
one
not
even
from
the
street
that
morning
by
the
providence
which
was
visible
in
this
became
in
our
prison
a
season
indeed
of
light
and
gratulation
and
the
day
passed
with
us
as
a
sabbath
to
our
spirits
the
anvils
of
fear
were
hushed
and
the
shuttles
in
the
looms
of
anxiety
were
at
rest
while
hope
again
walked
abroad
in
those
sunny
fields
where
amidst
vernal
blossoms
and
shining
dews
she
expatiates
on
the
delights
of
the
flowing
cluster
and
the
ripened
fruit
the
young
man
who
had
been
so
guided
to
find
the
bar
of
iron
concerted
with
another
friend
of
his
to
be
in
readiness
at
night
on
a
signal
from
us
to
master
the
sentinel
and
at
the
time
appointed
they
did
so
and
it
happened
that
the
soldier
was
the
same
humane
englisher
jack
windsor
who
had
allowed
me
to
escape
at
kilmarnock
and
he
not
only
remained
silent
but
even
when
relieved
from
his
post
said
nothing
so
that
to
the
number
of
more
than
twenty
we
lowered
ourselves
into
the
street
and
escaped
but
the
city
gates
at
that
hour
being
shut
there
was
no
egress
from
the
town
and
many
of
us
knew
not
where
to
hide
ourselves
till
the
morning
such
was
my
condition
and
wandering
up
and
down
for
some
time
at
last
i
turned
into
the
where
i
saw
a
light
in
a
window
on
looking
around
i
beheld
by
that
light
engraven
on
the
lintel
of
an
opposite
door
in
the
lord
is
my
hope
heartened
by
the
singular
providence
that
was
so
manifest
in
that
cheering
text
i
went
to
the
door
and
knocked
and
a
maiden
answered
to
the
knocking
i
told
her
what
i
was
and
whence
i
had
come
and
entreated
her
to
have
compassion
and
shelter
me
for
the
night
alas
said
she
what
can
hae
sent
you
here
for
this
is
a
house
i
was
astounded
to
hear
that
i
had
been
so
led
into
the
lion
den
but
i
saw
pity
in
the
countenance
of
the
damsel
and
i
told
her
that
i
was
the
father
of
the
poor
youth
whose
head
had
been
carried
by
the
executioner
through
the
town
the
day
before
and
that
i
could
not
but
believe
providence
had
sent
me
thither
for
surely
no
one
would
ever
think
of
searching
for
me
in
a
bishop
house
greatly
moved
by
what
i
said
she
bade
me
softly
follow
her
and
she
led
me
to
a
solitary
and
ruinous
chamber
she
then
retired
but
presently
returned
with
some
refreshment
which
having
placed
on
an
old
chest
she
bade
god
be
with
me
and
went
away
with
a
spirit
of
inexpressible
admiration
and
thanksgiving
i
partook
of
that
repast
and
then
laying
myself
down
on
the
bare
floor
was
blessed
with
the
enjoyment
of
a
downy
sleep
chapter
lxxxii
i
slept
in
that
ruinous
room
in
the
bishop
house
till
far
in
the
morning
when
on
going
to
the
window
with
the
intent
of
dropping
myself
into
the
wynd
i
saw
that
it
was
ordained
and
required
of
me
to
remain
where
i
then
was
for
the
inmates
of
the
houses
forenent
were
all
astir
at
their
respective
vocations
and
at
the
foot
of
the
wynd
looking
straight
up
was
a
into
which
there
was
even
at
that
early
hour
a
great
resorting
of
bein
elderly
citizens
for
their
dram
and
snap
moreover
at
the
head
of
the
wynd
an
aged
carlin
with
a
distaff
in
her
arms
and
a
whorl
in
her
hand
sat
on
a
doorstep
tending
a
stand
of
apples
and
comfits
so
that
to
a
surety
had
i
made
any
attempt
to
escape
by
the
window
i
must
have
been
seen
by
some
one
and
laid
hold
of
i
therefore
retired
back
into
the
obscurity
of
the
chamber
and
sat
down
again
on
the
old
to
abide
the
issues
that
were
in
reservation
for
me
i
had
not
however
been
long
there
till
i
heard
the
voices
of
persons
entering
into
the
next
chamber
behind
where
i
was
sitting
and
i
soon
discerned
by
their
courtesies
of
speech
that
they
were
lords
of
the
privy
council
who
had
come
to
walk
with
the
bishop
to
the
palace
where
a
council
was
summoned
in
sudden
haste
that
morning
the
matter
whereof
they
discoursed
was
not
at
first
easily
made
out
for
they
were
conversing
on
it
when
they
entered
but
i
very
soon
gathered
that
it
boded
no
good
to
the
covenanted
cause
nor
to
the
liberties
of
scotland
what
you
remark
aberdeen
said
one
is
very
just
man
and
wife
are
the
same
person
and
although
queensberry
has
observed
that
the
revenue
requires
the
penalties
and
that
husbands
ought
to
pay
for
their
wives
i
look
not
on
the
question
in
that
light
for
it
is
not
right
in
my
opinion
that
the
revenues
of
the
crown
should
be
in
any
degree
dependent
on
fines
and
forfeitures
but
the
presbyterians
are
a
sect
whose
main
principle
is
rebellion
and
it
would
be
happy
for
the
kingdom
were
the
whole
race
rooted
out
indeed
i
am
quite
of
the
duke
of
opinion
that
there
will
be
little
peace
among
us
till
the
lowlands
are
made
a
and
therefore
am
i
as
earnest
as
queensberry
that
the
fines
should
be
enforced
certainly
my
lord
perth
replied
aberdeen
it
is
not
to
be
denied
that
what
with
their
covenants
and
solemn
leagues
and
gospel
pretensions
the
presbyterians
are
dangerous
and
bad
subjects
and
though
i
shall
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
with
the
duke
that
the
lowlands
should
be
laid
waste
i
doubt
if
there
be
a
loyal
subject
west
the
castle
of
edinburgh
still
the
office
which
i
have
the
honour
to
hold
does
not
allow
me
to
put
any
interpretation
on
the
law
different
from
the
terms
in
which
the
sense
is
conceived
then
said
perth
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
the
terms
the
law
must
be
altered
for
unless
we
can
effectually
crush
the
presbyterians
the
duke
will
assuredly
have
a
rough
accession
and
it
is
better
to
strangle
the
lion
in
his
nonage
than
to
encounter
him
in
his
full
growth
i
fear
my
lord
replied
the
earl
of
aberdeen
that
the
presbyterians
are
stronger
already
than
we
are
willing
to
let
ourselves
believe
the
attempt
to
make
them
accept
the
episcopalian
establishment
has
now
been
made
without
intermission
for
more
than
twenty
years
and
they
are
even
less
submissive
than
they
were
at
the
beginning
yes
i
confess
said
lord
perth
that
they
are
most
unreasonably
stubborn
it
is
truly
melancholy
to
see
what
fools
many
sensible
men
make
of
themselves
about
the
forms
of
worship
especially
about
those
of
a
religion
so
ungentlemanly
as
the
presbyterian
which
has
no
respect
for
the
degrees
of
rank
neither
out
nor
in
the
church
i
afraid
perth
replied
aberdeen
laughing
that
what
you
say
is
applicable
both
to
the
king
and
his
brother
for
between
ourselves
i
do
not
think
there
are
two
persons
in
the
realm
who
attach
so
much
importance
to
forms
as
they
do
not
the
king
my
lord
not
the
king
cried
perth
charles
is
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
to
trouble
himself
about
any
such
trifles
they
are
surely
not
trifles
for
they
overturned
his
father
throne
and
are
shaking
his
own
replied
aberdeen
emphatically
pray
have
you
heard
any
thing
of
argyle
lately
o
yes
exclaimed
perth
merrily
a
capital
story
he
has
got
in
with
a
rich
burgomaster
frow
at
amsterdam
and
she
has
guilders
anew
to
indemnify
him
for
the
loss
of
half
the
highlands
aye
replied
aberdeen
i
do
not
like
that
for
there
has
been
of
late
a
flocking
of
the
presbyterian
malcontents
to
holland
and
the
prince
of
orange
gives
them
a
better
reception
than
an
honest
man
should
do
standing
as
he
does
both
with
respect
to
the
crown
and
the
duke
this
take
my
word
for
it
perth
is
not
a
thing
to
be
laughed
at
all
that
aberdeen
only
shows
the
necessity
of
exterminating
these
cursed
presbyterians
we
shall
have
no
peace
in
scotland
till
they
are
swept
clean
away
it
is
not
to
be
endured
that
a
king
shall
not
rule
his
own
kingdom
as
he
pleases
how
would
argyle
and
there
was
no
man
prouder
in
his
jurisdictions
have
liked
had
his
tenants
covenanted
against
him
as
the
presbyterians
have
so
insultingly
done
against
his
majesty
government
let
every
man
bring
the
question
home
to
his
own
business
and
bosom
and
the
answer
will
be
a
short
one
with
the
presbyterians
while
they
were
thus
speaking
and
i
need
not
advert
to
what
passed
in
my
breast
as
i
overheard
them
patterson
the
bishop
of
edinburgh
came
in
and
with
many
interjections
mingled
with
wishes
for
a
calm
procedure
he
told
the
lords
of
our
escape
he
was
indeed
to
do
him
justice
a
man
of
some
repute
for
plausibility
and
take
him
all
in
all
for
a
prelate
he
was
in
truth
not
void
of
the
charities
of
human
nature
compared
with
others
of
his
sect
your
news
said
the
lord
perth
to
him
does
not
surprise
me
the
societies
as
the
cameronians
are
called
have
inserted
their
roots
and
feelers
every
where
rely
upo
bishop
patterson
that
unless
we
chop
off
the
whole
connexions
of
the
conspiracy
you
can
hope
neither
for
homage
nor
reverence
in
your
appointments
i
could
wish
replied
the
bishop
that
some
experiment
were
made
of
a
gentler
course
than
has
hitherto
been
tried
it
is
now
a
long
time
since
force
was
first
employed
perhaps
were
his
royal
highness
to
slacken
the
severities
conformity
would
lose
some
of
its
terrors
in
the
eyes
of
the
misguided
presbyterians
at
all
events
a
more
lenient
policy
could
do
no
harm
and
if
it
did
no
good
it
would
at
least
be
free
from
those
imputed
cruelties
which
are
supposed
to
justify
the
resistance
that
has
brought
the
royal
authority
into
such
difficulties
at
this
juncture
of
their
conversation
a
gentleman
announced
that
his
master
was
ready
to
proceed
with
them
to
the
palace
and
they
forthwith
retired
thus
did
i
obtain
a
glimpse
of
the
inner
mind
of
the
privy
council
by
which
i
clearly
saw
that
what
with
those
members
who
satisfied
their
consciences
as
to
iniquity
because
it
was
made
seemingly
lawful
by
human
statutes
and
what
with
those
who
like
lord
perth
considered
the
kingdom
the
king
estate
and
the
people
his
tenantry
not
the
subjects
of
laws
by
which
he
was
bound
as
much
as
they
together
with
those
others
who
like
the
bishop
considered
mercy
and
justice
as
expedients
of
state
policy
that
there
was
no
hope
for
the
peace
and
religious
liberties
of
the
presbyterians
merely
by
resistance
and
i
from
that
time
began
to
think
it
was
only
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
prince
of
orange
then
to
the
crown
failing
james
stuart
duke
of
york
that
my
vow
could
be
effectually
brought
to
pass
chapter
lxxxiii
as
soon
as
those
of
the
privy
council
had
with
their
attendants
left
the
house
and
proceeded
to
join
the
duke
of
york
in
the
palace
the
charitable
damsel
came
to
me
and
conveyed
me
undiscovered
through
the
hall
and
into
the
cowgate
where
she
had
provided
a
man
a
friend
of
her
own
one
charles
brownlee
who
had
been
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
philistines
to
conduct
me
out
of
the
town
and
by
him
i
was
guided
in
safety
through
the
cowgate
and
put
into
a
house
just
without
the
same
where
his
mother
resided
here
said
he
it
will
be
as
well
for
you
to
bide
out
the
daylight
and
being
now
forth
the
ye
can
gang
where
ye
like
unquestioned
in
the
gloaming
and
so
saying
he
went
away
leaving
me
with
his
mother
an
ancient
matron
with
something
of
the
remnant
of
ladyness
about
her
yet
was
she
not
altogether
an
entire
gentlewoman
though
at
the
first
glimpse
she
had
the
look
of
one
of
the
very
highest
degree
notwithstanding
however
that
apparition
of
finery
which
was
about
her
she
was
in
truth
and
in
heart
a
sincere
woman
and
had
in
the
better
days
of
her
younger
years
been
as
she
rehearsed
to
me
gentlewoman
to
the
countess
of
argyle
mother
and
was
on
a
footing
of
cordiality
with
divers
ladies
of
the
bedchamber
of
what
she
called
the
three
nobilities
meaning
those
of
scotland
england
and
ireland
so
that
i
saw
there
might
by
her
be
opened
a
mean
of
espial
into
the
camp
of
the
adversaries
so
i
told
her
of
my
long
severe
malady
and
the
shock
i
had
suffered
by
what
i
had
seen
of
my
martyred
son
and
entreated
that
she
would
allow
me
to
abide
with
her
until
my
spirits
were
more
composed
mrs
brownlee
having
the
compassion
of
a
christian
and
the
tenderness
of
her
gentle
sex
was
moved
by
my
story
and
very
readily
consented
instead
therefore
of
going
forth
at
random
in
the
evening
as
i
was
at
one
time
mindet
i
remained
in
her
house
where
indeed
could
i
at
that
time
flee
in
the
hope
of
finding
any
place
of
refuge
but
although
this
was
adopted
on
the
considerations
of
human
reason
it
was
nevertheless
a
link
in
the
chain
of
providential
methods
by
which
i
was
to
achieve
the
fulfilment
of
my
vow
the
house
of
mrs
brownlee
being
as
i
have
intimated
nigh
to
the
gate
of
the
city
i
saw
from
the
window
all
that
went
into
and
came
out
therefrom
and
the
same
afternoon
i
had
visible
evidence
of
the
temper
wherewith
the
duke
of
york
and
his
counsellors
had
been
actuated
that
day
at
holyrood
in
consequence
of
the
manner
in
which
we
had
been
delivered
from
prison
for
jack
windsor
the
poor
sentinel
who
was
on
guard
when
we
escaped
by
the
window
was
brought
out
supported
by
two
of
his
companions
his
feet
having
been
so
crushed
in
the
torturous
boots
before
the
council
during
his
examination
anent
us
that
he
could
scarcely
mark
them
to
the
ground
his
hands
were
also
bound
in
cloths
through
which
the
blood
was
still
oozing
from
the
pressure
of
those
dreadful
thumbikins
of
iron
that
were
so
often
used
in
those
days
to
screw
accusations
out
of
honest
men
a
sympathizing
crowd
followed
the
destroyed
sufferer
and
the
sight
for
a
little
while
afflicted
me
with
sore
regret
but
when
i
considered
the
compassion
that
the
people
showed
for
him
i
was
filled
with
a
strange
satisfaction
deducing
therefrom
encouraging
persuasions
that
every
new
sin
of
the
persecutors
removed
a
prop
from
their
own
power
making
its
overthrow
more
and
more
inevitable
while
i
was
peering
from
the
window
in
these
reflections
i
saw
quintin
fullarton
the
grandson
of
john
fullarton
of
dykedivots
in
the
street
and
knowing
that
from
the
time
of
he
had
been
joined
with
that
zealous
and
martyred
youth
richard
cameron
and
was
as
robin
brown
told
me
among
other
acquaintances
at
airsmoss
i
entreated
mrs
brownlee
to
go
after
him
and
bid
him
come
to
me
which
he
readily
did
and
we
had
a
mournful
communing
for
some
time
he
told
me
the
particulars
of
my
gallant
joseph
death
and
that
it
was
by
the
command
of
claverhouse
himself
that
the
brave
stripling
head
was
cut
off
and
sent
in
ignominy
to
edinburgh
where
by
order
of
the
privy
council
it
was
placed
on
the
netherbow
what
i
hae
suffered
from
that
man
said
i
heaven
may
pardon
but
i
can
neither
forget
nor
forgive
the
judgment
time
coming
replied
quintin
fullarton
and
your
part
in
it
ringan
gilhaize
assuredly
will
not
be
forgotten
for
in
the
heavens
there
is
a
doer
of
justice
and
an
avenger
of
wrongs
and
then
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
on
the
following
afternoon
there
was
to
be
a
meeting
of
the
heads
of
the
cameronian
societies
with
mr
renwick
in
a
dell
of
the
esk
about
half
a
mile
above
laswade
to
consult
what
ought
to
be
done
the
pursuit
and
persecution
being
so
hot
against
them
that
life
was
become
a
burden
and
their
minds
desperate
we
hae
many
friens
said
he
in
edinburgh
and
i
am
entrusted
to
warn
them
to
the
meeting
which
is
the
end
of
my
coming
to
the
town
and
maybe
ringan
gilhaize
ye
no
objek
yoursel
to
be
there
i
will
be
there
quintin
fullarton
said
i
and
in
the
strength
of
the
lord
i
will
come
armed
with
a
weapon
of
more
might
than
the
sword
and
more
terrible
than
the
ball
that
flieth
unseen
what
mean
you
ringan
said
he
compassionately
for
he
knew
of
my
infirmity
and
thought
that
i
was
still
fevered
in
the
mind
but
i
told
him
that
for
some
time
feeling
myself
unable
for
warlike
enterprises
i
had
meditated
on
a
way
to
perplex
our
guilty
adversaries
the
which
was
to
menace
them
with
retaliation
for
resistance
alone
was
no
longer
enough
we
have
disowned
charles
stuart
as
our
king
said
i
and
we
must
wage
war
accordingly
but
go
your
ways
and
execute
your
purposes
and
by
the
time
you
return
this
way
i
shall
have
a
paper
ready
the
sending
forth
of
which
will
strike
terror
into
the
brazen
hearts
of
our
foes
i
perceived
that
he
was
still
dubious
of
me
but
nevertheless
he
promised
to
call
as
he
came
back
and
having
gone
away
i
set
myself
down
and
drew
up
that
declaration
wherein
after
again
calmly
disowning
the
royal
authority
of
charles
stuart
we
admonished
our
sanguinary
persecutors
that
for
we
would
retaliate
according
to
our
power
and
the
degree
of
guilt
on
such
privy
counsellors
lords
of
justiciary
officers
and
soldiers
their
abettors
and
informers
whose
hands
should
continue
to
be
imbrued
in
our
blood
and
on
the
return
of
quintin
fullarton
i
gave
the
paper
to
him
that
it
might
be
seen
and
considered
by
mr
renwick
and
others
previous
to
offering
it
to
the
consideration
of
the
meeting
he
read
it
over
very
sedately
and
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
the
crown
of
his
bonnet
without
saying
a
word
but
several
times
while
he
was
reading
he
cast
his
eyes
towards
me
and
when
he
rose
to
go
away
he
said
ringan
gilhaize
you
have
endured
much
but
verily
if
this
thing
can
be
brought
to
pass
your
own
and
all
our
sufferings
will
soon
be
richly
revenged
not
revenged
said
i
revenge
quintin
fullarton
becomes
not
christian
men
but
we
shall
be
the
executioners
of
the
just
judgments
of
him
whose
ministers
are
flaming
fires
and
pestilence
and
war
and
storms
and
perjured
kings
with
these
words
we
parted
and
next
morning
by
break
of
day
i
rose
after
the
enjoyment
of
a
solacing
sleep
such
as
i
had
not
known
for
many
days
and
searched
my
way
across
the
fields
towards
laswade
i
did
not
however
enter
the
clachan
but
lingered
among
the
woods
till
the
afternoon
when
descending
towards
the
river
i
walked
leisurely
up
the
banks
where
i
soon
fell
in
with
others
of
the
associated
friends
chapter
lxxxiv
the
place
where
we
met
was
a
deep
glen
the
scroggy
sides
whereof
were
as
if
rocks
and
trees
and
brambles
with
here
and
there
a
yellow
primrose
and
a
blue
hyacinth
between
had
been
thrown
by
some
wild
architect
into
many
a
difficult
and
fantastical
form
over
a
ledge
of
rock
fell
the
bright
waters
of
the
esk
and
in
the
clear
linn
the
trouts
shuttled
from
stone
and
crevice
dreading
the
persecutions
of
the
angler
who
in
the
luxury
of
his
pastime
heedeth
not
what
they
may
in
their
cool
element
suffer
it
was
then
the
skirt
of
the
afternoon
about
the
time
when
the
sweet
breathing
of
flowers
and
boughs
first
begins
to
freshen
to
the
gentle
senses
and
the
shadows
deepen
in
the
cliffs
of
the
rocks
and
darken
among
the
bushes
the
yellow
sunbeams
were
still
bright
on
the
flickering
leaves
of
a
few
trees
which
here
and
there
raised
their
tufty
heads
above
the
glen
but
in
the
hollow
of
the
chasm
the
evening
had
commenced
and
the
sobriety
of
the
fragrant
twilight
was
coming
on
as
we
assembled
one
by
one
we
said
little
to
each
other
some
indeed
said
nothing
nor
even
shook
hands
but
went
and
seated
themselves
on
the
rocks
round
which
the
limpid
waters
were
swirling
with
a
soft
and
pleasant
din
as
if
they
solicited
tranquillity
for
myself
i
had
come
with
the
sternest
intents
and
i
neither
noticed
nor
spoke
to
any
one
but
going
to
the
brink
of
the
linn
i
sat
myself
down
in
a
gloomy
nook
and
was
sullen
that
the
scene
was
not
better
troubled
into
unison
with
the
resentful
mood
of
my
spirit
at
last
mr
renwick
came
and
when
he
had
descended
into
the
dell
where
we
were
gathered
together
after
speaking
a
few
words
of
courtesy
to
certain
of
his
acquaintance
he
went
to
a
place
on
the
shelvy
side
of
the
glen
and
took
his
station
between
two
i
will
be
short
with
you
friends
said
he
for
here
we
are
too
nigh
unto
the
adversaries
to
hazard
ourselves
in
any
long
debate
and
therefore
i
will
tell
you
as
a
man
speaking
the
honesty
that
is
within
him
i
neither
can
nor
do
approve
of
the
paper
that
i
understand
some
among
you
desire
we
should
send
forth
i
have
however
according
to
what
was
exhibited
to
me
in
private
brought
here
a
proclamation
such
as
those
who
are
most
vehement
among
us
wish
to
propound
but
i
still
leave
it
with
yourselves
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
should
be
adopted
entering
as
i
here
do
my
caveat
as
an
individual
against
it
this
paper
will
cut
off
all
hope
of
reconciliation
we
have
already
disowned
king
charles
it
is
true
but
this
implies
that
we
are
also
resolved
to
avenge
even
unto
blood
and
death
whatsoever
injury
we
may
in
our
own
persons
and
friends
be
subjected
to
suffer
it
pledges
us
to
a
war
of
revenge
and
extermination
and
we
have
to
consider
before
we
wage
the
same
the
strength
of
our
adversary
the
craft
of
his
counsellors
and
the
malice
with
which
their
fears
and
their
hatred
will
inspire
them
for
my
own
part
i
do
doubt
if
there
be
any
warrandice
in
the
scriptures
for
such
a
defiance
as
this
paper
contains
and
i
would
fain
entreat
you
to
reflect
whether
it
be
not
better
to
keep
the
door
of
reconciliation
open
than
to
shut
it
for
ever
as
the
promulgation
of
this
retaliatory
edict
will
assuredly
do
the
earnest
manner
in
which
mr
renwick
thus
delivered
himself
had
a
powerful
effect
and
many
thought
as
he
did
and
several
rose
and
said
that
it
was
not
christian
to
bar
the
door
on
peace
and
to
shut
out
even
the
chance
of
contrition
on
the
part
of
the
king
and
his
ministers
i
heard
what
they
said
i
listened
to
what
they
argued
and
i
allowed
them
to
tell
that
they
were
willing
to
agree
to
more
moderate
counsels
but
i
could
abide
no
more
moderation
you
mr
renwick
said
i
counsel
moderation
you
recommend
the
door
of
peace
to
be
still
kept
open
you
doubt
if
the
scriptures
warrant
us
to
undertake
revenge
and
you
hope
that
our
forbearance
may
work
to
repentance
among
our
enemies
mr
renwick
you
have
hitherto
been
a
preacher
not
a
sufferer
with
you
the
resistance
to
charles
stuart
government
has
been
a
thing
of
doctrine
of
no
more
than
doctrine
mr
renwick
with
us
it
is
a
consideration
of
facts
judge
ye
therefore
between
yourself
and
us
i
say
between
yourself
and
us
for
i
ask
no
other
judge
to
decide
whether
we
are
not
by
all
the
laws
of
god
and
man
justified
in
avowing
that
we
mean
to
do
as
we
are
done
by
and
mr
renwick
you
will
call
to
mind
that
in
this
sore
controversy
the
cause
of
debate
came
not
from
us
we
were
peaceable
christians
enjoying
the
shade
of
the
vine
and
of
the
gospel
planted
by
the
care
and
cherished
by
the
blood
of
our
forefathers
protected
by
the
laws
and
gladdened
in
our
protection
by
the
oaths
and
the
covenants
which
the
king
had
sworn
to
maintain
the
presbyterian
freedom
of
worship
was
our
property
we
were
in
possession
and
enjoyment
no
man
could
call
our
right
to
it
in
question
the
king
had
vowed
as
a
condition
before
he
was
allowed
to
receive
the
crown
that
he
would
preserve
it
yet
for
more
than
twenty
years
there
has
been
a
most
cruel
fraudulent
and
outrageous
endeavour
instituted
and
carried
on
to
deprive
us
of
that
freedom
and
birthright
we
were
asking
no
new
thing
from
government
we
were
taking
no
step
to
disturb
government
we
were
in
peace
with
all
men
when
government
with
the
principles
of
a
robber
and
the
cruelty
of
a
tyrant
demanded
of
us
to
surrender
those
immunities
of
conscience
which
our
fathers
had
earned
and
defended
to
deny
the
gospel
as
it
is
written
in
the
evangelists
and
to
accept
the
commentary
of
charles
stuart
a
man
who
has
had
no
respect
to
the
most
solemn
oaths
and
of
james
sharp
the
apostate
of
st
andrews
whose
crimes
provoked
a
deed
that
but
for
their
crimson
hue
no
man
could
have
doubted
to
call
a
most
foul
murder
the
king
and
his
crew
mr
renwick
are
to
the
indubitable
judgment
of
all
just
men
the
causers
and
the
aggressors
in
the
existing
difference
between
his
subjects
and
him
in
so
far
therefore
if
blame
there
be
it
lieth
not
with
us
nor
in
our
cause
but
sir
not
content
with
attempting
to
wrest
from
us
our
inherited
freedom
of
religious
worship
charles
stuart
and
his
abettors
have
pursued
the
courageous
constancy
with
which
we
have
defended
the
same
with
more
animosity
than
they
ever
did
any
crime
i
speak
not
to
you
mr
renwick
of
your
own
outcast
condition
perhaps
you
delight
in
the
perils
of
martyrdom
i
speak
not
to
those
around
us
who
in
their
persons
their
substance
and
their
families
have
endured
the
torture
poverty
and
irremediable
dishonour
they
may
be
meek
and
hallowed
men
willing
to
endure
but
i
call
to
mind
what
i
am
and
was
myself
i
think
of
my
quiet
home
it
is
all
ashes
i
remember
my
brave
he
was
slain
at
why
need
i
speak
of
my
honest
brother
the
waves
of
the
ocean
commissioned
by
our
persecutors
have
triumphed
over
him
in
the
cold
seas
of
the
orkneys
and
as
for
my
wife
what
was
she
to
you
ye
can
not
be
greatly
disturbed
that
she
is
in
her
grave
no
ye
are
quiet
calm
and
prudent
persons
it
would
be
a
most
indiscreet
thing
of
you
you
who
have
suffered
no
wrong
yourselves
to
stir
on
her
account
and
then
how
unreasonable
i
should
be
were
i
to
speak
of
two
fair
and
innocent
it
is
weak
of
me
to
weep
though
they
were
my
daughters
o
men
and
christians
brothers
fathers
but
ye
are
content
to
bear
with
such
wrongs
and
i
alone
of
all
here
may
go
to
the
gates
of
the
cities
and
try
to
discover
which
of
the
martyred
heads
mouldering
there
belongs
to
a
son
or
a
friend
nor
is
it
of
any
account
whether
the
bones
of
those
who
were
so
dear
to
us
be
exposed
with
the
remains
of
malefactors
or
laid
in
the
sacred
grave
to
the
dead
all
places
are
alike
and
to
the
slave
what
signifies
who
is
master
let
us
therefore
forget
the
past
let
us
keep
open
the
door
of
reconciliation
smother
all
the
wrongs
we
have
endured
and
kiss
the
proud
foot
of
the
trampler
we
have
our
lives
we
have
been
spared
the
merciless
have
not
yet
reached
us
let
us
therefore
be
humble
and
thankful
and
cry
to
charles
stuart
o
king
live
for
ever
for
he
has
but
cast
us
into
a
fiery
furnace
and
a
lion
den
in
truth
friends
mr
renwick
is
quite
right
this
feeling
of
indignation
against
our
oppressors
is
a
most
imprudent
thing
if
we
desire
to
enjoy
our
own
contempt
and
to
deserve
the
derision
of
men
and
to
merit
the
abhorrence
of
heaven
let
us
yield
ourselves
to
all
that
charles
stuart
and
his
sect
require
we
can
do
nothing
better
nothing
so
meritorious
nothing
by
which
we
can
so
reasonably
hope
for
punishment
here
and
condemnation
hereafter
but
if
there
is
one
man
at
this
meeting
i
am
speaking
not
of
shapes
and
forms
but
of
feelings
if
there
is
one
here
that
feels
as
men
were
wont
to
feel
he
will
draw
his
sword
and
say
with
me
woe
to
the
house
of
stuart
woe
to
the
oppressors
blood
for
blood
judge
and
avenge
our
cause
o
lord
chapter
lxxxv
the
meeting
with
one
accord
agreed
that
the
declaration
should
go
forth
and
certain
of
those
who
were
ready
writers
being
provided
with
implements
retired
apart
to
make
copies
while
mr
renwick
with
the
remainder
joined
together
in
prayer
by
the
time
he
had
made
an
end
the
task
of
the
writers
was
finished
and
then
lots
were
cast
to
see
whom
the
lord
would
appoint
to
affix
the
declaration
on
the
trones
and
kirk
doors
of
the
towns
where
the
rage
of
the
persecutors
burnt
the
fiercest
and
he
being
pleased
to
choose
me
for
one
to
do
the
duty
at
edinburgh
i
returned
in
the
gloaming
back
to
the
house
of
mrs
brownlee
to
abide
the
convenient
season
which
i
knew
in
the
fit
time
would
be
prepared
nor
was
it
long
till
the
same
was
brought
to
pass
as
i
shall
now
briefly
proceed
to
set
down
heron
brownlee
who
as
i
have
narrated
brought
me
to
his
house
was
by
trade
a
tailor
and
kept
his
cloth
shop
in
the
canongate
some
six
doors
lower

just
after
passing
the
flesher
stocks
below
the
netherbow
for
in
those
days
when
the
court
was
at
holyrood
that
part
of
the
town
was
a
place
of
great
resort
to
the
gallants
and
all
such
as
affected
a
courtly
carriage
and
it
happened
that
on
the
morning
after
the
meeting
a
proclamation
was
sent
forth
describing
the
persons
and
clothing
of
the
prisoners
who
had
escaped
from
the
tolbooth
with
me
threatening
grievous
penalties
to
all
who
dared
to
harbour
them
this
heron
brownlee
seeing
affixed
on
the
cheek
of
the
netherbow
came
and
told
me
whereupon
after
conferring
with
him
it
was
agreed
that
he
should
provide
for
me
a
suit
of
clothes
and
at
the
that
they
might
not
cause
observance
by
any
novelty
this
was
in
another
respect
needful
for
my
health
being
in
a
frail
state
i
stood
in
want
of
the
halesome
cordial
of
fresh
air
whereof
i
could
not
venture
to
taste
but
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
he
accordingly
provided
the
apparel
and
when
clothed
therewith
i
made
bold
to
go
out
in
the
broad
daylight
and
even
ventured
to
mingle
with
the
multitude
in
the
garden
of
the
palace
who
went
daily
there
in
the
afternoon
to
see
the
nobles
and
ladies
of
the
court
walking
with
their
pageantries
while
the
duke
musicants
solaced
them
with
melodious
airs
and
the
delights
of
sonorous
harmony
and
it
happened
on
the
third
time
i
went
thither
that
a
cry
rose
of
the
duke
coming
from
the
garden
to
the
palace
and
all
the
onlookers
pressed
to
see
him
as
he
advanced
i
saw
several
persons
presenting
petitions
into
his
hands
which
he
gave
without
then
looking
at
to
the
lord
perth
whom
i
knew
again
by
his
voice
and
i
was
directed
as
by
a
thought
of
inspiration
to
present
in
like
manner
a
copy
of
our
declaration
which
i
always
carried
about
with
me
so
placing
myself
among
a
crowd
of
petitioners
onlookers
and
servants
that
formed
an
avenue
across
the
road
leading
from
the
canongate
to
the
abbey
and
between
the
garden
yett
and
the
yett
that
opened
into
the
front
court
of
the
palace
as
the
duke
returned
out
of
the
garden
i
gave
him
the
paper
but
instead
of
handing
it
to
the
lord
perth
as
i
had
hoped
he
would
do
he
held
it
in
his
own
hand
by
which
i
perceived
that
if
he
had
noticed
by
whom
it
was
presented
and
looked
at
it
before
he
went
into
the
palace
i
would
speedily
be
seized
on
the
spot
unless
i
could
accomplish
my
escape
but
how
to
effect
that
was
no
easy
thing
for
the
multitude
around
was
very
great
and
but
three
narrow
yetts
allowed
of
egress
from
the
enclosure
one
leading
into
the
garden
one
to
the
palace
and
the
other
into
the
canongate
i
therefore
calmly
put
my
trust
in
him
who
alone
could
save
me
and
remained
as
it
were
an
indifferent
spectator
following
the
duke
with
an
anxious
eye
having
passed
from
the
garden
into
the
court
the
multitude
followed
him
with
great
eagerness
and
i
also
went
in
with
them
and
walked
very
deliberately
across
the
front
of
the
palace
to
the
corner
where
there
was
a
postern
door
that
opened
into
the
road
leading
to
the
king
park
from
the
along
the
outside
of
the
town
wall
i
then
mended
my
pace
but
not
to
any
remarkable
degree
and
so
returned
to
the
house
of
mrs
brownlee
scarcely
was
i
well
in
when
heron
her
son
came
flying
to
her
with
a
report
that
a
man
was
seized
in
the
palace
garden
who
had
threatened
the
duke
life
and
he
was
fearful
lest
it
had
been
me
and
i
was
much
grieved
by
these
tidings
in
case
any
honest
man
should
be
put
to
the
torture
on
my
account
but
the
lord
had
mercifully
ordained
it
otherwise
in
the
course
of
the
night
heron
brownlee
after
closing
his
shop
came
again
and
told
me
that
no
one
had
been
taken
but
that
some
person
in
the
multitude
had
given
the
duke
a
dreadful
paper
which
had
caused
great
consternation
and
panic
and
that
a
council
was
sitting
at
that
late
hour
with
the
duke
expresses
having
arrived
with
accounts
of
the
same
paper
having
been
seen
on
the
doors
of
many
churches
both
in
nithsdale
and
the
shire
of
ayr
the
alarm
indeed
raged
to
such
a
degree
among
all
those
who
knew
in
their
consciences
how
they
merited
the
doom
we
had
pronounced
that
it
was
said
the
very
looks
of
many
were
withered
as
with
a
pestilent
vapour
yet
though
terrified
at
the
vengeance
declared
against
their
guilt
neither
the
duke
nor
the
privy
council
were
to
be
deterred
from
their
malignant
work
the
curse
of
infatuation
was
upon
them
and
instead
of
changing
the
rule
which
had
caused
the
desperation
that
they
dreaded
they
heated
the
furnace
of
persecution
sevenfold
and
voted
that
whosoever
owned
or
refused
to
disown
the
declaration
should
be
put
to
death
in
the
presence
of
two
witnesses
though
unarmed
when
taken
and
the
soldiers
were
not
only
ordered
to
enforce
the
test
but
were
instructed
to
put
such
as
adhered
to
the
declaration
at
once
to
the
sword
and
to
slay
those
who
refused
to
disown
it
and
women
were
ordered
to
be
drowned
but
my
pen
sickens
with
the
recital
of
horrors
and
i
shall
pass
by
the
dreadful
things
that
ensued
with
only
remarking
that
these
bloody
instructions
consummated
the
doom
of
the
stuarts
for
scarcely
were
they
well
published
when
the
duke
hastened
to
london
and
soon
after
his
brother
charles
the
great
author
of
all
our
woes
was
cut
off
by
poison
as
it
was
most
currently
believed
and
the
duke
proclaimed
king
in
his
stead
what
change
we
obtained
by
the
calamity
of
his
accession
will
not
require
many
sentences
to
unfold
chapter
lxxxvi
as
soon
as
it
was
known
abroad
that
charles
the
second
was
dead
the
covenanters
who
had
taken
refuge
in
holland
from
the
persecution
assembled
to
consult
what
ought
then
to
be
done
for
the
papist
james
stuart
on
the
death
of
his
brother
had
caused
himself
to
be
proclaimed
king
of
scotland
without
taking
those
oaths
by
which
alone
he
could
be
entitled
to
assume
the
scottish
crown
at
the
head
of
this
congregation
was
the
earl
of
argyle
who
some
years
before
had
incurred
the
aversion
of
the
tyrant
to
such
a
degree
that
by
certain
of
those
fit
tools
for
any
crime
then
in
dismal
abundance
about
the
court
of
holyrood
he
had
procured
his
condemnation
as
a
traitor
and
would
have
brought
him
to
the
scaffold
had
the
earl
not
fortunately
effected
his
escape
and
it
was
resolved
by
that
congregation
that
the
principal
personages
then
present
should
form
themselves
into
a
council
to
concert
the
requisite
measures
for
the
deliverance
of
their
native
land
the
immediate
issue
of
which
was
that
a
descent
should
be
made
by
argyle
among
his
vassals
in
order
to
draw
together
a
sufficient
host
to
enable
them
to
wage
war
against
the
usurper
for
so
they
lawfully
and
rightly
denominated
james
stuart
the
first
hint
that
i
gleaned
of
this
design
was
through
the
means
of
mrs
brownlee
she
was
invited
one
afternoon
by
the
gentlewoman
of
the
lady
sophia
lindsay
the
earl
to
view
certain
articles
of
female
bravery
which
had
been
sent
from
holland
by
his
lordship
to
her
mistress
and
as
her
custom
was
she
on
her
return
home
descanted
at
large
of
all
that
she
had
seen
and
heard
the
receipt
at
that
juncture
of
such
gear
from
the
earl
of
argyle
by
such
a
judith
of
courage
and
wisdom
as
the
lady
sophia
lindsay
seemed
to
me
very
remarkable
and
i
could
not
but
jealouse
that
there
was
some
thing
about
it
like
the
occultation
of
a
graver
correspondence
i
therefore
began
to
question
mrs
brownlee
how
the
paraphernalia
had
come
and
what
the
earl
according
to
the
last
accounts
was
doing
which
led
her
to
expatiate
on
many
things
though
vague
and
desultory
that
were
yet
in
concordance
with
what
i
had
overheard
the
lord
perth
say
to
the
earl
of
aberdeen
in
the
bishop
house
in
the
end
i
gathered
that
the
presents
were
brought
over
by
the
skipper
of
a
sloop
one
roderick
macfarlane
whom
i
forthwith
determined
to
see
in
order
to
pick
from
him
what
intelligence
i
could
without
being
at
the
time
well
aware
in
what
manner
the
same
would
prove
useful
i
felt
myself
however
stirred
from
within
to
do
so
and
i
had
hitherto
in
all
that
concerned
my
avenging
vow
obeyed
every
instinctive
impulse
accordingly
next
morning
i
went
early
to
the
shore
of
leith
and
soon
found
the
vessel
and
roderick
macfarlane
to
whom
i
addressed
myself
inquiring
as
if
i
intended
to
go
thither
when
he
was
likely
to
depart
again
for
amsterdam
while
i
was
speaking
to
him
i
observed
something
in
his
mien
above
his
condition
and
that
his
hands
were
fair
and
delicate
unlike
those
of
men
inured
to
maritime
labour
he
perceived
that
i
was
particular
in
my
inspection
and
his
countenance
became
troubled
and
he
looked
as
if
he
wist
not
what
to
do
fear
no
ill
said
i
to
him
i
am
one
in
the
jaws
of
jeopardy
in
sooth
i
have
no
intent
to
pass
into
holland
but
only
to
learn
whether
there
be
any
hope
that
the
earl
of
argyle
and
those
with
him
will
try
to
help
their
covenanted
brethren
at
home
on
hearing
me
speak
so
openly
the
countenance
of
the
man
brightened
and
after
eyeing
me
with
a
sharp
scrutiny
he
invited
me
to
come
down
into
the
body
of
the
bark
where
we
had
some
frank
communion
his
confidence
being
won
by
the
plain
tale
of
who
i
was
and
what
i
had
endured
the
lord
indeed
was
pleased
throughout
that
period
of
fears
and
tribulation
marvellously
to
endow
the
persecuted
with
a
singular
and
sympathetic
instinct
whereby
they
were
enabled
at
once
to
discern
their
friends
for
the
dangers
and
difficulties
to
which
we
were
subject
in
our
intercourse
afforded
no
time
for
those
testimonies
and
experiences
that
in
ordinary
occasions
are
required
to
open
the
hearts
of
men
to
one
another
after
some
general
discourse
roderick
macfarlane
told
me
that
his
vessel
though
seemingly
only
for
traffic
had
been
hired
by
a
certain
madam
smith
in
amsterdam
and
was
manned
by
highlanders
of
a
degree
above
the
common
for
the
purpose
of
opening
a
correspondence
between
argyle
and
his
friends
in
scotland
whereupon
i
proffered
myself
to
assist
in
establishing
a
communication
with
the
heads
and
leaders
of
the
covenanters
in
the
west
country
and
particularly
with
mr
renwick
and
his
associates
the
cameronians
who
though
grievously
scattered
and
hunted
were
yet
able
to
do
great
things
in
the
way
of
conveying
letters
or
of
intercepting
the
emissaries
and
agents
of
the
privy
council
that
might
be
employed
to
contravene
the
earl
projects
thus
it
was
that
i
came
to
be
concerned
in
argyle
unfortunate
expedition
if
that
can
be
called
unfortunate
which
though
in
itself
a
failure
yet
ministered
to
make
the
scattered
children
of
the
covenant
again
for
the
achievement
of
their
common
freedom
doubtless
the
expedition
was
undertaken
before
the
persecuted
were
sufficiently
ripened
to
be
of
any
effective
service
the
earl
counted
overmuch
on
the
spirit
which
the
persecution
had
raised
he
thought
that
the
weight
of
the
tyranny
had
compressed
us
all
into
one
body
but
alas
it
had
been
so
great
that
it
had
not
only
bruised
but
broken
us
asunder
into
many
pieces
and
time
and
care
and
much
persuasion
were
all
requisite
to
solder
the
fragments
together
as
the
spring
advanced
being
in
the
manner
related
engaged
in
furthering
the
purposes
of
the
exiled
covenanters
i
prepared
through
the
instrumentality
of
divers
friends
many
in
the
west
country
to
be
in
readiness
to
join
the
earl
standard
of
deliverance
it
is
not
however
to
be
disguised
that
the
work
went
on
but
slowly
and
that
the
people
heard
of
the
intended
descent
with
something
like
an
actionless
wonderment
in
consequence
of
those
by
whom
it
had
been
planned
not
sending
forth
any
declaration
of
their
views
and
intents
and
this
indisposition
especially
among
the
cameronians
became
a
settled
reluctance
when
after
the
earl
had
reached
campbelton
he
published
that
purposeless
proclamation
wherein
though
the
wrongs
and
woes
of
the
kingdom
were
pithily
recited
the
nature
of
the
redress
proposed
was
in
no
manner
manifest
it
was
plain
indeed
by
many
signs
that
the
lord
time
was
not
yet
come
for
the
work
to
thrive
the
divisions
in
argyle
councils
were
greater
even
than
those
among
the
different
orders
into
which
the
covenanters
had
been
long
split
the
very
cameronians
might
have
been
sooner
persuaded
to
refrain
from
insisting
on
points
of
doctrine
and
opinion
at
least
till
the
adversary
was
overthrown
than
those
who
were
with
the
earl
to
act
with
union
among
themselves
in
a
word
all
about
the
expedition
was
confusion
and
perplexity
and
the
omens
and
auguries
of
ruin
showed
how
much
it
wanted
the
favour
that
is
better
than
the
strength
of
numbers
or
the
wisdom
of
mighty
men
but
to
proceed
chapter
lxxxvii
sir
john
cochrane
one
of
those
who
were
with
argyle
had
by
some
espial
of
his
own
a
correspondence
with
divers
of
the
covenanters
in
the
shire
of
ayr
and
he
was
so
heartened
by
their
representations
of
the
spirit
among
them
that
he
urged
and
overcame
the
earl
to
let
him
make
a
trial
on
that
coast
before
waiting
till
the
highlanders
were
roused
accordingly
with
the
three
ships
and
the
men
they
had
brought
from
holland
he
went
toward
largs
famed
in
old
time
for
a
great
battle
fought
there
but
on
arriving
opposite
to
the
shore
he
found
it
guarded
by
the
powers
and
forces
of
the
government
in
so
much
that
he
was
fain
to
direct
his
course
farther
up
the
river
and
weighing
anchor
sailed
for
greenock
it
happened
at
this
juncture
after
conferring
with
several
of
weight
among
the
cameronians
that
i
went
to
greenock
for
the
purpose
of
taking
shipping
for
any
place
where
i
was
likely
to
find
argyle
in
order
to
represent
to
him
that
unless
there
was
a
clear
account
of
what
he
and
others
with
him
proposed
to
do
he
could
expect
no
cooperation
from
the
societies
and
i
reached
the
town
just
as
the
three
ships
were
coming
in
sight
i
had
not
well
alighted
from
my
horse
at
dugal
the
public
the
best
house
it
is
in
the
town
and
slated
it
stands
beside
an
on
the
open
shore
below
the
above
the
place
where
the
mariners
boil
their
as
i
was
saying
i
had
not
well
alighted
there
when
a
squadron
of
certain
and
inheritors
of
the
shire
of
renfrew
under
the
command
of
houston
of
that
ilk
came
galloping
to
the
town
as
if
they
would
have
devoured
argyle
host
and
ships
and
all
and
they
rode
straight
to
the
minister
glebe
where
behind
the
dyke
they
set
themselves
in
battle
array
with
drawn
swords
the
vessels
having
in
the
meanwhile
come
to
anchor
fornent
the
kirk
like
the
men
of
the
town
i
went
to
be
an
onlooker
at
a
distance
of
what
might
ensue
and
a
sore
heart
it
was
to
me
to
see
and
to
hear
that
the
greenock
folk
stood
so
much
in
dread
of
their
superior
sir
john
shaw
that
they
durst
not
for
fear
of
his
venture
to
say
that
day
whether
they
were
papists
prelates
or
presbyterians
he
himself
not
being
in
the
way
to
direct
them
shortly
after
the
ships
had
cast
anchor
major
fullarton
with
a
party
of
some
ten
or
twelve
men
landed
at
the
near
the
kirk
and
having
shown
a
signal
for
parley
houston
and
his
men
went
to
him
and
began
to
chafe
and
chide
him
for
invading
the
country
we
are
no
invaders
said
the
major
we
have
come
to
our
native
land
to
preserve
the
protestant
religion
and
i
am
grieved
that
such
brave
gentlemen
as
ye
appear
to
be
should
be
seen
in
the
cause
of
a
papist
tyrant
and
usurper
ye
lee
cried
houston
and
fired
his
pistol
at
the
major
the
like
did
his
men
but
they
were
so
well
and
quickly
answered
in
the
same
language
that
they
soon
were
obligated
to
flee
like
drift
to
the
brow
of
a
hill
called
where
they
again
showed
face
those
on
board
the
ships
seeing
what
was
thus
doing
on
the
land
pointed
their
great
guns
to
the
airt
where
the
cavaliers
had
rallied
and
fired
them
with
such
effect
that
the
stoure
and
stones
brattled
about
the
lugs
of
the
heritors
which
so
terrified
them
all
that
they
scampered
off
and
it
is
said
some
drew
not
bridle
till
they
were
in
paisley
with
whole
skins
though
at
some
cost
of
leather
when
these
tyrant
tools
were
thus
discomfited
sir
john
cochrane
came
on
shore
and
tried
in
vain
to
prevail
on
the
inhabitants
to
join
in
defence
of
religion
and
liberty
so
he
sent
for
the
who
was
the
ruling
power
of
the
town
in
the
absence
of
their
great
sir
john
and
ordered
him
to
provide
forthwith
two
hundred
bolls
of
meal
for
the
ships
but
the
bailie
a
shrewd
and
gausie
man
made
so
many
difficulties
in
the
gathering
of
the
meal
to
waste
time
till
help
would
come
that
the
knight
was
glad
to
content
himself
with
little
more
than
a
fifth
part
of
his
demand
meanwhile
i
had
made
my
errand
known
to
sir
john
cochrane
and
when
he
went
off
with
the
to
the
ships
i
went
with
him
and
we
sailed
the
same
night
to
the
castle
of
allengreg
where
argyle
himself
then
was
whatever
doubts
and
fears
i
had
of
the
success
of
the
expedition
were
all
wofully
confirmed
when
i
saw
how
things
were
about
that
unfortunate
nobleman
the
controversies
in
our
councils
at
the
pentland
raid
were
more
than
renewed
among
those
who
were
around
argyle
and
it
was
plain
to
me
that
the
sense
of
ruin
was
upon
his
spirit
for
after
i
had
told
him
the
purport
of
my
mission
he
said
to
me
in
a
mournful
manner
i
can
discern
no
party
in
this
country
that
desire
to
be
relieved
there
are
some
hidden
ones
no
doubt
but
only
my
poor
friends
here
in
argyle
seem
willing
to
be
free
god
hath
so
ordered
it
and
it
must
be
for
the
best
i
submit
myself
to
his
will
i
felt
the
truth
of
what
he
said
that
the
tyranny
had
indeed
bred
distrust
among
us
and
that
the
patience
of
men
was
so
worn
out
that
very
many
were
inclined
to
submit
from
mere
weariness
of
spirit
but
i
added
to
hearten
him
if
one
of
my
condition
may
say
so
proud
a
thing
of
so
great
a
person
that
were
the
distinct
ends
of
his
intents
made
more
clearly
manifest
maybe
the
dispersed
hearts
of
the
covenanters
would
yet
be
knit
together
some
think
my
lord
ye
for
the
duke
of
monmouth
to
be
king
but
that
will
do
the
rightful
heirs
canna
be
set
aside
james
stuart
may
be
and
should
be
put
down
but
according
to
the
customs
registered
as
i
hae
read
in
the
ancient
chronicles
of
this
realm
when
our
nation
in
olden
times
cut
off
a
king
for
his
misdeeds
the
next
lawful
heir
was
aye
raised
to
the
throne
to
this
the
earl
made
no
answer
but
continued
some
time
thoughtful
and
then
said
it
rests
not
all
with
me
those
who
are
with
me
as
you
may
well
note
take
over
much
upon
them
and
will
not
be
controlled
they
are
like
the
waves
raised
and
driven
wheresoever
any
blast
of
rumour
wiseth
them
to
go
i
gave
a
letter
of
trust
to
one
of
their
emissaries
and
like
the
raven
he
has
never
returned
if
however
i
could
get
to
inverary
i
doubt
not
yet
that
something
might
be
done
for
i
should
then
be
in
the
midst
of
some
that
would
reverence
argyle
but
why
need
i
dwell
on
these
melancholious
incidents
next
day
the
earl
resolved
to
make
the
attempt
to
reach
inverary
and
i
went
with
him
but
after
the
castle
of
arkinglass
in
the
way
thither
had
been
taken
he
was
obligated
by
the
appearance
of
two
english
frigates
which
had
been
sent
in
pursuit
of
the
expedition
to
return
to
allengreg
for
the
main
stores
and
ammunition
brought
from
holland
were
lodged
in
that
castle
the
ships
also
were
lying
there
all
which
in
a
manner
were
at
stake
and
no
garrison
adequate
to
defend
the
same
from
so
great
a
power
on
returning
to
allengreg
argyle
saw
it
would
be
a
golden
achievement
if
in
that
juncture
he
could
master
the
frigates
so
he
ordered
his
force
which
amounted
to
about
a
thousand
men
to
man
the
ships
and
four
prizes
which
he
had
together
with
about
thirty
cowan
boats
belonging
to
his
vassals
and
to
attack
the
frigates
but
in
this
also
he
was
disappointed
for
those
who
were
with
him
and
wedded
to
the
purpose
of
going
to
the
lowlands
mutinied
against
the
scheme
as
too
hazardous
and
obliged
him
to
give
up
the
attempt
and
to
leave
the
castle
with
a
weak
and
incapable
garrison
accordingly
reluctant
but
yielding
to
these
blind
counsels
after
quitting
allengreg
we
marched
for
the
lowlands
and
at
the
head
of
the
gareloch
where
we
halted
the
garrison
which
had
been
left
at
allengreg
joined
us
with
the
disastrous
intelligence
that
finding
themselves
unable
to
withstand
the
frigates
they
had
abandoned
all
i
was
near
to
argyle
when
the
news
of
this
was
brought
to
him
and
i
observed
that
he
said
nothing
but
his
cheek
faded
and
he
hastily
wrung
his
hands
having
crossed
the
river
leven
a
short
way
above
dumbarton
without
suffering
any
material
molestation
we
halted
for
the
night
but
as
we
were
setting
our
watches
a
party
of
the
government
force
appeared
so
that
instead
of
getting
any
rest
after
our
heavy
march
we
were
obligated
to
think
of
again
moving
the
earl
would
fain
have
fought
with
that
force
his
numbers
being
superior
but
he
was
again
overruled
so
that
all
we
could
do
was
during
the
night
leaving
our
burning
for
a
delusion
to
make
what
haste
we
could
toward
glasgow
in
this
the
uncountenanced
fortunes
of
the
expedition
were
again
seen
our
guides
in
the
dark
misled
us
so
that
instead
of
being
taken
to
glasgow
we
were
after
grievous
traversing
in
the
moors
landed
on
the
banks
of
the
clyde
near
kilpatrick
where
the
whole
force
broke
up
sir
john
cochrane
being
fey
for
the
west
country
persuading
many
to
go
with
him
over
the
water
in
order
to
make
for
the
shire
of
ayr
the
earl
seeing
himself
thus
deserted
and
but
few
besides
those
of
his
own
kin
left
with
him
rode
about
a
mile
on
towards
glasgow
with
the
intent
of
taking
some
rest
in
the
house
of
one
who
had
been
his
servant
but
on
reaching
the
door
it
was
shut
in
his
face
and
barred
and
admission
peremptorily
refused
he
said
nothing
but
turned
round
to
us
with
a
smile
of
such
resigned
sadness
that
it
brought
tears
into
every
eye
seeing
that
his
fate
was
come
to
such
extremity
i
proposed
to
exchange
clothes
with
him
that
he
might
the
better
escape
and
to
conduct
him
to
the
west
country
where
if
any
chance
were
yet
left
it
was
to
be
found
there
as
sir
john
cochrane
had
represented
whereupon
he
sent
his
kinsmen
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
back
to
the
highlands
to
try
what
could
be
done
among
his
clan
and
having
accepted
a
portion
of
my
apparel
he
went
to
the
with
major
fullarton
and
we
crossed
the
water
together
on
landing
at
the
renfrew
side
the
earl
went
forward
alone
a
little
before
the
major
and
me
but
on
reaching
the
ford
at
inchinnan
he
was
stopped
by
two
soldiers
who
laid
hands
upon
him
one
on
each
side
and
in
the
grappling
one
of
them
the
earl
fell
to
the
ground
in
a
moment
however
his
lordship
started
up
and
got
rid
of
them
by
presenting
his
pistols
but
five
others
at
the
same
instant
came
in
sight
and
fired
and
ran
in
at
him
and
knocked
him
down
with
their
swords
alas
unfortunate
argyle
i
heard
him
cry
as
he
fell
and
the
soldiers
were
so
astonished
at
having
so
rudely
treated
so
great
a
man
that
they
stood
still
with
awe
and
dropped
their
swords
and
some
of
them
shed
tears
of
sorrow
for
his
fate
seeing
what
had
thus
happened
major
fullarton
and
i
fled
and
hid
ourselves
behind
a
hedge
for
we
saw
another
party
of
troopers
coming
towards
the
spot
we
heard
afterwards
that
it
was
sir
john
shaw
of
greenock
with
some
of
the
renfrewshire
heritors
by
whom
the
earl
was
conducted
a
prisoner
to
glasgow
but
of
the
dismal
indignities
and
the
degradations
to
which
he
was
subjected
and
of
his
doleful
martyrdom
the
courteous
reader
may
well
spare
me
the
sad
recital
as
they
are
recorded
in
all
true
british
histories
and
he
will
accept
for
the
same
those
sweet
but
mournful
lines

chapter
lxxxviii
the
news
of
the
fall
of
argyle
was
as
gladdening
wine
to
the
cruel
spirit
of
james
stuart
it
was
treated
by
him
as
victory
was
of
old
among
the
conquering
romans
and
he
ordained
medals
of
brass
and
of
silver
to
be
made
to
commemorate
as
a
glorious
triumph
the
deed
that
was
a
crime
but
he
was
not
content
with
such
harmless
monuments
of
insensate
exultation
he
considered
the
blow
as
final
to
the
presbyterian
cause
and
openly
set
himself
to
effect
the
of
the
idolatrous
abominations
of
the
mass
and
monkrie
the
lord
perth
and
his
brother
the
lord
melford
and
a
black
catalogue
of
others
whose
names
for
the
fame
of
scotland
i
would
fain
expunge
with
the
waters
of
oblivion
considering
religion
as
a
thing
of
royal
regulation
professed
themselves
papists
and
got
as
the
price
of
their
apostacy
and
perdition
certain
places
of
profit
in
the
government
clouds
of
the
papistical
locust
were
then
allured
into
the
land
to
eat
it
up
leaf
and
blade
again
schools
to
teach
children
the
deceits
and
the
frauds
and
the
sins
of
the
jesuits
were
established
even
in
the
palace
of
and
the
chapel
which
had
been
cleansed
in
the
time
of
queen
mary
was
again
defiled
with
the
pageantries
of
idolatry
but
the
godly
people
of
edinburgh
called
to
mind
the
pious
bravery
of
their
forefathers
and
all
that
they
had
done
in
the
reformation
and
they
rose
as
it
were
with
one
accord
and
demolished
the
schools
and
purified
the
chapel
even
to
desolation
and
forced
the
papist
priest
to
abjure
his
own
idols
the
old
abhorrence
of
the
abominations
was
revived
for
now
it
was
clearly
seen
what
king
charles
and
his
brother
had
been
seeking
in
the
relentless
persecution
which
they
had
so
long
sanctioned
and
many
in
consequence
who
had
supported
and
obeyed
the
prelatic
apostasy
as
a
thing
but
of
innocent
forms
trembled
at
the
share
which
they
had
taken
in
the
guilt
of
that
aggression
and
their
dismay
was
unspeakable
the
tyrant
however
soon
saw
that
he
had
the
degree
of
the
humiliation
of
the
land
and
being
disturbed
by
the
union
which
his
open
papistry
was
causing
among
all
denominations
of
protestants
he
changed
his
mood
and
from
force
resorting
to
fraud
publishing
a
general
toleration
a
device
of
policy
which
greatly
disheartened
the
prelatic
faction
for
they
saw
that
they
had
only
laboured
to
strengthen
a
prerogative
the
first
effectual
exercise
of
which
was
directed
against
themselves
every
one
discerning
that
the
indulgence
was
framed
to
give
to
the
papists
but
the
covenanters
made
use
of
it
to
advance
the
cause
of
the
gospel
as
i
shall
now
proceed
to
rehearse
as
well
as
how
through
it
i
was
enabled
to
perform
my
avenging
vow
among
the
exiled
covenanters
who
returned
with
argyle
and
with
whom
i
became
acquainted
while
with
him
was
thomas
ardmillan
when
after
my
escape
at
the
time
when
the
earl
was
taken
i
fell
in
again
with
at
kirkintilloch
as
i
was
making
the
best
of
my
way
into
the
east
country
and
we
went
together
to
arbroath
where
he
embarked
for
holland
being
then
minded
to
return
back
to
edinburgh
and
to
abide
again
with
mrs
brownlee
in
whose
house
i
had
found
a
safe
asylum
and
a
convenient
place
of
espial
after
seeing
him
on
board
the
vessel
i
also
took
shipping
and
returned
to
leith
under
an
assurance
that
i
should
hear
of
him
from
time
to
time
it
was
not
however
until
the
indulgence
was
proclaimed
that
i
heard
from
him
about
which
era
he
wrote
to
me
a
most
scriptural
letter
by
the
reverend
mr
patrick
warner
who
had
received
a
call
from
the
magistrates
and
inhabitants
of
the
covenanted
town
of
irvine
to
take
upon
him
the
ministry
of
their
parish
mr
warner
having
accepted
the
call
on
arriving
at
leith
sent
to
mrs
brownlee
this
letter
with
a
request
that
if
i
was
alive
and
there
he
would
be
glad
to
see
me
in
his
lodging
before
departing
to
the
west
country
as
the
fragrance
of
mr
warner
sufferings
was
sweet
among
all
the
true
and
faithful
i
was
much
regaled
with
this
invitation
and
went
forthwith
to
leith
where
i
found
him
in
a
house
that
is
clad
with
in
the
close
he
was
sitting
in
a
fair
chamber
therein
with
that
worthy
bailie
that
afterwards
was
next
year
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
mr
cornelius
neilsone
and
his
no
less
excellent
compeer
on
the
same
great
occasion
mr
george
samsone
both
persons
of
godly
repute
mr
cheyne
the
was
likewise
present
a
most
discreet
character
but
being
a
lawyer
by
trade
and
come
of
an
episcopal
stock
he
was
rather
a
thought
it
was
said
inclined
to
the
prelatic
sect
divers
others
douce
and
religious
characters
were
also
there
especially
mr
jaddua
fyfe
a
merchant
of
women
gear
then
in
much
renown
for
his
suavity
mr
warner
was
relating
to
them
many
consolatory
things
of
the
worth
and
piety
of
the
prince
and
princess
of
orange
to
whom
the
eyes
of
all
the
protestants
especially
of
the
presbyterians
were
at
that
time
directed
aye
aye
said
mr
jaddua
fyfe
nae
doot
nae
doot
but
the
prince
is
a
man
of
a
odour
that
in
the
way
of
character
and
the
princess
aye

it
is
well
known
that
she
a
pure
snowdrop

in

piety
they
the
heirs
presumptive
to
the
crown
subjoined

they
weel
entitled
to
the
reverence
and
respect
of
us
a
added
mr
cornelius
neilsone
when
i
first
got
the
call
from
irvine
resumed
mr
warner
that
excellent
lady
and
precious
vessel
of
godliness
the
countess
of
sutherland
being
then
at
the
hague
sought
my
allowance
to
let
the
princess
know
of
my
acceptance
of
the
call
and
to
inquire
if
her
highness
had
any
commands
for
scotland
and
the
princess
in
a
most
gracious
manner
signified
to
her
that
the
best
thing
i
and
those
who
were
like
me
could
do
for
her
was
to
be
earnest
in
praying
that
she
might
be
kept
firm
and
faithful
in
the
reformed
religion
adding
many
tender
things
of
her
sincere
sympathy
for
the
poor
persecuted
people
of
scotland
and
recommending
that
i
should
wait
on
the
prince
before
taking
my
departure
i
was
not
however
forward
to
thrust
myself
into
such
honour
but
at
last
yielding
to
the
exhortations
of
my
friends
i
went
to
the
house
of
mynheer
bentinck
and
gave
him
my
name
for
an
audience
and
one
morning
about
eight
of
the
clock
his
servant
called
for
me
and
took
me
to
his
house
and
he
himself
conveyed
me
into
the
presence
of
the
prince
where
leaving
me
with
him
we
had
a
most
weighty
and
edifying
conversation
aye
aye
interposed
mr
jaddua
fyfe
it
was
a
great
thing
to
converse
wi
a
prince
and
how
did
he
behave
himself
that
in
the
way
manners
ye
need
na
debate
mr
fyfe
about
that
replied
mr
samsone
the
prince
kens
what
it
to
be
civil
especially
to
his
friends
and
i
thought
in
saying
these
words
that
mr
samsone
looked
particular
towards
me
and
what
passed
said
the
in
a
way
as
if
he
pawkily
jealoused
something
mr
warner
however
in
his
placid
and
manner
responded
i
told
his
highness
how
i
had
received
the
call
from
irvine
and
thought
it
my
duty
to
inquire
if
there
was
any
thing
wherein
i
could
serve
him
in
scotland
to
this
the
prince
replied
in
a
benign
manner
aye
aye
ejaculated
mr
jaddua
fyfe
nae
doubt
it
was
in
a
benignant
manner
and
in
a
cordial
manner
aye
aye
he
has
nae
his
to
seek
when
a
customer
afore
the
counter
that
in
the
way
business
understand
said
his
highness
continued
mr
warner
are
called
home
upon
the
toleration
lately
granted
but
i
can
assure
you
that
toleration
is
not
granted
for
any
kindness
to
your
party
but
to
favour
the
papists
and
to
divide
you
among
yourselves
yet
i
think
you
may
be
so
wise
as
to
take
good
of
it
and
prevent
the
evil
designed
and
instead
of
dividing
come
to
a
better
harmony
among
yourselves
when
you
have
liberty
to
see
and
meet
more
freely
to
which
said
mr
warner
i
answered
that
i
heartily
wished
it
might
prove
so
and
that
nothing
would
be
wanting
on
my
part
to
make
it
so
and
i
added
the
presbyterians
in
scotland
great
sir
are
looked
upon
as
a
very
despicable
party
but
those
who
do
so
measure
them
by
the
appearance
at
pentland
and
bothwell
as
if
the
whole
power
of
the
presbyterians
had
been
drawn
out
there
but
i
can
assure
your
highness
that
such
are
greatly
mistaken
for
many
firm
presbyterians
were
not
satisfied
as
to
the
grounds
and
manner
of
those
risings
and
did
not
join
and
others
were
borne
down
by
the
persecution
in
verity
i
am
persuaded
that
if
scotland
were
left
free
of
three
parts
of
the
people
two
would
be
found
presbyterians
we
are
indeed
a
poor
persecuted
party
and
have
none
under
god
to
look
to
for
our
help
and
relief
but
your
highness
on
account
of
that
relation
you
and
the
princess
have
to
the
crown
that
was
going
a
great
length
mr
warner
said
mr
cheyne
the
no
a
bit
no
a
bit
cried
i
and
mr
jaddua
fyfe
gave
me
an
approving
gloom
while
mr
warner
quietly
continued
i
then
urged
many
things
hoping
that
the
lord
would
incline
his
highness
heart
to
espouse
his
interest
in
scotland
and
befriend
the
persecuted
presbyterians
to
which
the
prince
replied
aye
aye
i
like
to
hear
what
his
highness
said
that
in
the
way
of
counselling
said
mr
jaddua
fyfe
the
prince
replied
mr
warner
then
spoke
to
me
earnestly
saying
have
been
educated
a
presbyterian
and
i
hope
so
to
continue
and
i
assure
you
if
ever
it
be
in
my
power
i
shall
make
the
presbyterian
the
established
of
scotland
and
of
this
you
may
assure
your
friends
as
in
prudence
you
find
it
convenient
discerning
the
weight
and
intimation
that
were
in
these
words
i
said
when
mr
warner
had
made
an
end
that
it
was
a
great
thing
to
know
the
sentiment
of
the
prince
for
by
all
signs
the
time
could
not
be
far
off
when
we
would
maybe
require
to
put
his
assurance
and
promise
to
the
test
at
which
words
of
mine
there
were
many
exchanges
of
gathered
brows
and
significant
nods
and
mr
jaddua
fyfe
to
whom
i
was
sitting
next
slyly
pinched
me
in
the
elbow
all
which
spoke
plainer
than
elocution
that
those
present
were
accorded
with
me
in
opinion
and
i
gave
inward
thanks
that
such
a
braird
of
renewed
courage
and
zeal
was
beginning
to
kithe
among
us
chapter
lxxxix
besides
mr
warner
many
other
ministers
who
had
taken
refuge
in
foreign
countries
were
called
home
and
it
began
openly
to
be
talked
that
king
james
would
to
a
surety
be
set
aside
on
account
of
his
malversations
in
the
kingly
office
in
england
and
the
course
he
was
pursuing
there
as
in
scotland
to
abolish
all
property
that
the
subjects
had
in
the
ancient
laws
and
charters
of
the
realm
but
the
thing
came
to
no
definite
head
till
that
device
for
cutting
out
the
protestant
heirs
to
the
crown
was
brought
to
maturity
by
palming
a
upon
the
nation
as
the
lawful
son
of
the
tyrant
and
his
papistical
wife
in
the
meantime
i
had
not
been
idle
in
disseminating
throughout
the
land
by
the
means
of
the
cameronians
a
faithful
account
of
what
mr
warner
had
related
of
the
pious
character
and
presbyterian
dispositions
of
the
prince
of
orange
and
through
a
correspondence
that
i
opened
with
thomas
ardmillan
mynheer
bentinck
was
kept
so
informed
of
the
growing
affection
for
his
master
in
scotland
as
soon
emboldened
the
prince
with
what
he
heard
of
the
inclinations
of
the
english
people
to
prepare
a
great
host
and
navy
for
the
deliverance
of
the
kingdoms
in
the
midst
of
these
human
means
and
stratagems
the
bright
right
hand
of
providence
was
shiningly
visible
for
by
the
news
of
the
prince
preparations
it
smote
the
councils
of
king
james
with
confusion
and
a
fatal
distraction
though
he
had
so
alienated
the
scottish
lieges
that
none
but
the
basest
of
men
among
us
acknowledged
his
authority
yet
he
summoned
all
his
forces
into
england
leaving
his
power
to
be
upheld
here
by
those
only
who
were
vile
enough
to
wish
for
the
continuance
of
slavery
thus
was
the
way
cleared
for
the
advent
of
the
deliverer
and
the
faithful
nobles
and
gentry
of
scotland
as
the
army
was
removed
came
flocking
into
edinburgh
and
the
privy
council
which
had
been
so
little
slack
in
any
crime
durst
not
molest
them
though
the
purpose
of
their
being
there
was
a
treason
which
the
members
could
not
but
all
well
know
every
thing
in
a
word
was
now
moving
onward
to
a
great
event
all
in
the
land
was
as
when
the
thaw
comes
and
the
ice
is
breaking
and
the
snows
melting
and
the
waters
flowing
and
the
rivers
are
bursting
their
frozen
fetters
and
the
sceptre
of
winter
is
broken
and
the
wreck
of
his
domination
is
drifting
and
perishing
away
to
keep
the
privy
council
in
the
confusion
of
the
darkness
of
ignorance
i
concerted
with
many
of
the
cameronians
that
they
should
spread
themselves
along
the
highways
and
intercept
the
government
expresses
and
emissaries
to
the
end
that
neither
the
king
faction
in
england
nor
in
scotland
might
know
aught
of
the
undertakings
of
each
other
and
when
thomas
ardmillan
sent
me
from
mynheer
bentinck
the
declaration
for
scotland
i
hastened
into
the
west
country
that
i
might
exhort
the
covenanted
there
to
be
in
readiness
and
from
the
tolbooth
stair
of
irvine
yea
on
the
very
step
where
my
heart
was
so
pierced
by
the
cries
of
my
son
i
was
the
first
in
scotland
to
publish
that
glorious
pledge
of
our
deliverance
on
the
same
day
at
the
same
hour
the
like
was
done
by
others
of
our
friends
at
glasgow
and
at
ayr
and
there
was
shouting
and
joy
and
thanksgiving
and
the
magnificent
voice
of
freedom
resounded
throughout
the
land
and
ennobled
all
hearts
again
with
bravery
when
the
news
of
the
prince
landing
at
torbay
arrived
we
felt
that
liberty
was
come
but
long
oppression
had
made
many
distrustful
and
from
day
to
day
rumours
were
spread
by
the
despairing
members
of
the
prelatic
sect
the
breathings
of
their
wishes
that
made
us
doubt
whether
we
ought
to
band
ourselves
into
any
array
for
warfare
in
this
state
of
swithering
and
incertitude
we
continued
for
some
time
till
i
began
to
grow
fearful
lest
the
zeal
which
had
been
so
rekindled
would
sink
and
go
out
if
not
stirred
again
in
some
effectual
manner
so
i
conferred
with
quintin
fullarton
who
in
all
these
providences
had
been
art
and
part
with
me
from
the
day
of
the
meeting
with
mr
renwick
near
laswade
and
as
the
privy
council
when
it
was
known
the
prince
had
been
invited
over
had
directed
beacons
to
be
raised
on
the
tops
of
many
mountains
to
be
fired
as
signals
of
alarm
for
the
king
party
when
the
dutch
fleet
should
be
seen
approaching
the
coast
we
devised
as
a
mean
for
calling
forth
the
strength
and
spirit
of
the
covenanters
that
we
should
avail
ourselves
of
their
preparations
accordingly
we
instructed
four
alert
young
men
of
the
cameronian
societies
severally
and
unknown
to
each
other
to
be
in
attendance
on
the
night
of
the
tenth
of
december
at
the
beacons
on
the
hills
of
knockdolian
lowthers
blacklarg
and
bencairn
that
they
might
fire
the
same
if
need
or
signal
should
so
require
quintin
fullarton
having
undertaken
to
kindle
the
one
on
mistylaw
himself
the
night
was
dark
but
it
was
ordained
that
the
air
should
be
moist
and
heavy
and
in
that
state
when
the
light
of
flame
spreads
farthest
meanwhile
fearful
reports
from
ireland
of
papistical
intents
to
maintain
the
cause
of
king
james
made
the
fancies
of
men
awake
and
full
of
anxieties
the
prelatic
curates
were
also
so
heartened
by
those
rumours
and
tidings
that
they
began
to
recover
from
the
dismay
with
which
the
news
of
the
prince
landing
had
overwhelmed
them
and
to
shoot
out
again
the
horns
of
antichristian
arrogance
but
when
about
three
hours
after
sunset
the
beacon
on
the
mistylaw
was
fired
and
when
hill
after
hill
was
lighted
up
the
whole
country
was
filled
with
such
consternation
and
panic
that
i
was
myself
smitten
with
the
dread
of
some
terrible
consequences
horsemen
passed
furiously
in
all
directions
bells
were
rung
and
drums
beat
mothers
were
seen
flying
with
their
children
they
knew
not
whither
cries
and
lamentations
echoed
on
every
side
the
skies
were
kindled
with
a
red
glare
and
none
could
tell
where
the
signal
was
first
shown
some
said
the
irish
had
landed
and
were
burning
the
towns
in
the
south
and
no
one
knew
where
to
flee
from
the
unknown
and
invisible
enemy
in
the
meantime
our
covenanters
of
the
west
assembled
at
their
to
the
number
of
more
than
six
thousand
armed
men
ready
and
girded
for
battle
and
this
appearance
was
an
assurance
that
no
power
was
then
in
all
the
lowlands
able
to
gainsay
such
a
force
and
next
day
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
alarm
had
no
real
cause
it
was
determined
that
the
prelatic
priests
should
be
openly
discarded
from
their
parishes
our
vengeance
however
was
not
meted
upon
them
by
the
measure
of
our
sufferings
but
by
the
treatment
which
our
own
pastors
had
borne
and
considering
how
many
of
them
had
acted
as
spies
and
accusers
against
us
it
is
surprising
that
of
two
hundred
who
were
banished
from
the
parishes
few
received
any
cause
of
complaint
even
the
poor
feckless
thing
andrew
dornock
was
decently
expelled
from
the
manse
of
quharist
on
promising
he
would
never
return
this
riddance
of
the
malignants
was
the
first
fruit
of
the
expulsion
of
james
stuart
from
the
throne
but
it
was
not
long
till
we
were
menaced
with
new
and
even
greater
sufferings
than
we
had
yet
endured
for
though
the
tyrant
had
fled
he
had
left
claverhouse
under
the
title
of
viscount
dundee
behind
him
and
in
the
fearless
activity
of
that
proud
and
cruel
warrior
there
was
an
engine
sufficient
to
have
restored
him
to
his
absolute
throne
as
i
shall
now
proceed
to
rehearse
chapter
xc
the
true
and
faithful
of
the
west
by
the
event
recorded
in
the
foregoing
chapter
being
so
instructed
with
respect
to
their
own
power
and
numbers
stood
in
no
reverence
of
any
force
that
the
remnants
of
the
tyrant
sect
and
faction
could
afford
to
send
against
them
i
therefore
resolved
to
return
to
edinburgh
for
the
longing
of
my
spirit
to
see
the
current
and
course
of
public
events
flowing
from
their
was
upon
me
and
i
had
not
yet
so
satisfied
the
yearnings
of
justice
as
to
be
able
to
look
again
on
the
ashes
of
my
house
and
the
tomb
of
sarah
lochrig
and
her
daughters
accordingly
soon
after
the
turn
of
the
year
i
went
thither
where
i
found
all
things
in
uncertainty
and
commotion
claverhouse
or
as
he
was
now
titled
lord
dundee
with
that
scorn
of
public
opinion
and
defect
of
all
principle
save
only
a
canine
fidelity
a
dog
love
to
his
papistical
master
domineered
with
his
dragoons
as
if
he
himself
had
been
regnant
monarch
of
scotland
and
it
was
plain
and
probable
that
unless
he
was
soon
bridled
he
would
speedily
act
upon
the
wider
stage
of
the
kingdom
the
same
part
that
he
had
played
in
the
prenticeship
of
his
cruelties
of
the
shire
of
ayr
the
peril
indeed
from
his
courage
and
activity
was
made
to
me
very
evident
by
a
conversation
that
i
had
with
one
david
middleton
who
had
come
from
england
on
some
business
of
the
jacobites
there
in
connection
with
dundee
providence
led
me
to
fall
in
with
this
person
one
morning
as
we
were
standing
among
a
crowd
of
other
onlookers
seeing
claverhouse
reviewing
his
men
in
the
front
court
of
i
happened
to
remark
for
in
sooth
it
must
be
so
owned
that
the
viscount
had
a
brave
though
a
proud
look
and
that
his
voice
had
the
manliness
of
one
ordained
to
command
yes
replied
david
middleton
he
is
a
born
soldier
and
if
the
king
is
to
be
restored
he
is
the
man
that
will
do
it
when
his
majesty
was
at
rochester
before
going
to
france
i
was
there
with
my
master
and
being
called
in
to
mend
the
fire
i
heard
dundee
and
my
lord
then
with
the
king
discoursing
concerning
the
royal
affairs
question
said
lord
dundee
to
his
majesty
whether
you
shall
stay
in
england
or
go
to
france
my
opinion
sir
is
that
you
should
stay
in
england
make
your
stand
here
and
summon
your
subjects
to
your
allegiance
is
true
you
have
disbanded
your
army
but
give
me
leave
and
i
will
undertake
to
get
ten
thousand
men
of
it
together
and
march
through
all
england
with
your
standard
at
their
head
and
drive
the
dutch
before
you
and
added
david
middleton
let
him
have
time
and
i
doubt
not
that
even
without
the
king
leave
he
will
do
as
much
whether
the
man
in
this
did
brag
of
a
knowledge
that
he
had
not
the
story
seemed
so
likely
that
it
could
scarcely
be
questioned
so
i
consulted
with
my
faithful
friend
and
companion
quintin
fullarton
and
other
men
of
weight
among
the
cameronians
and
we
agreed
that
those
of
the
societies
who
were
scattered
along
the
borders
to
intercept
the
correspondence
between
the
english
and
scottish
jacobites
should
be
called
into
edinburgh
to
daunt
the
rampageous
insolence
of
claverhouse
this
was
done
accordingly
and
from
the
day
that
they
began
to
appear
in
the
streets
the
bravery
of
those
who
were
with
him
seemed
to
slacken
but
still
he
carried
himself
as
boldly
as
ever
and
persuaded
the
duke
of
gordon
then
governor
of
the
castle
not
to
surrender
nor
obey
any
mandate
from
the
convention
of
the
states
by
whom
in
that
interregnum
the
rule
of
the
kingdom
was
exercised
still
however
the
cameronians
were
coming
in
and
their
numbers
became
so
manifest
that
the
dragoons
were
backward
to
show
themselves
but
their
commander
affected
not
to
value
us
till
one
day
a
singular
thing
took
place
which
in
its
issues
ended
the
overawing
influence
of
his
presence
in
edinburgh
i
happened
to
be
standing
with
quintin
fullarton
and
some
four
or
five
other
cameronians
at
an
forenent
the
when
claverhouse
and
that
tool
of
tyranny
sir
george
mackenzie
the
advocate
were
coming
up
from
the
palace
and
as
they
passed
the
viscount
looked
hard
at
me
and
said
to
sir
george
i
have
somewhere
seen
that
doure
cur
before
sir
george
turned
round
also
to
look
and
i
said
it
true
claverhouse
we
met
at
drumclog
and
i
touched
my
arm
that
he
had
wounded
there
adding
and
the
blood
shed
that
day
has
not
yet
been
paid
for
at
these
words
he
made
a
rush
upon
me
with
his
sword
but
my
friends
were
nimbler
with
theirs
and
sir
george
mackenzie
interposing
drew
him
off
and
they
went
away
together
the
affair
however
ended
not
here
sir
george
with
the
subtlety
of
a
lawyer
tried
to
turn
it
to
some
account
and
making
a
great
ado
of
it
as
a
design
to
assassinate
lord
dundee
and
himself
tried
to
get
the
convention
to
order
all
strangers
to
remove
from
the
town
this
however
was
refused
so
that
claverhouse
seeing
how
the
spirit
of
the
times
was
going
among
the
members
and
the
boldness
with
which
the
presbyterians
and
the
covenanters
were
daily
bearding
his
arrogance
withdrew
with
his
dragoons
from
the
city
and
made
for
stirling
in
this
retreat
from
edinburgh
he
blew
the
trumpet
of
civil
war
but
in
less
than
two
hours
from
the
signal
a
regiment
of
eight
hundred
cameronians
was
arrayed
in
the
the
son
of
argyle
who
had
taken
his
seat
in
the
convention
as
a
peer
soon
after
gathered
three
hundred
of
the
campbells
and
the
safety
of
scotland
now
seemed
to
be
secured
by
the
arrival
of
mackay
with
three
scotch
regiments
then
in
the
dutch
service
and
which
the
prince
of
orange
had
brought
with
him
to
torbay
by
the
retreat
of
claverhouse
the
jacobite
party
in
edinburgh
were
so
disheartened
and
any
endeavour
which
they
afterwards
made
to
rally
was
so
crazed
with
consternation
that
it
was
plain
the
sceptre
had
departed
from
their
master
the
capacity
as
well
as
the
power
for
any
effectual
action
was
indeed
evidently
taken
from
them
and
the
ploughshare
was
driven
over
the
ruins
of
their
cause
on
the
eleventh
day
of
april
when
william
and
mary
were
proclaimed
king
and
queen
but
though
thus
the
oppressor
was
cast
down
from
his
throne
and
though
thus
in
scotland
the
chief
agents
in
the
work
of
deliverance
were
the
outlawed
cameronians
as
instructed
by
me
the
victory
could
not
be
complete
nor
the
trophies
hung
up
in
the
hall
while
the
tyrant
possessed
an
instrument
of
such
edge
and
temper
as
claverhouse
as
for
myself
i
felt
that
while
the
homicide
lived
the
debt
of
justice
and
of
blood
due
to
my
martyred
family
could
never
be
satisfied
and
i
heard
of
his
passing
from
stirling
into
the
highlands
and
the
wonders
he
was
working
for
the
jacobite
cause
there
as
if
nothing
had
yet
been
achieved
toward
the
fulfilment
of
my
avenging
vow
chapter
xci
when
claverhouse
left
stirling
he
had
but
sixty
horse
in
little
more
than
a
month
he
was
at
the
head
of
seventeen
hundred
men
he
obtained
reinforcements
from
ireland
the
macdonalds
and
the
camerons
and
the
gordons
were
all
his
a
vassal
of
the
marquis
of
athol
had
declared
for
him
even
in
the
castle
of
blair
and
defended
it
against
the
clan
of
his
master
an
event
still
more
strange
was
produced
by
the
spell
of
his
presence
the
clansmen
of
athol
deserted
their
chief
and
joined
his
standard
he
kindled
the
hills
in
his
cause
and
all
the
life
of
the
north
was
gathering
around
him
mackay
with
the
covenanters
the
regiments
from
holland
and
the
cameronians
went
from
perth
to
oppose
his
entrance
into
the
lowlands
the
minds
of
men
were
suspended
should
he
defeat
mackay
it
was
plain
that
the
crown
would
soon
be
restored
to
james
stuart
and
the
woes
of
scotland
come
again
in
that
dismal
juncture
i
was
alone
for
quintin
fullarton
with
all
the
cameronians
was
with
mackay
i
was
an
old
man
verging
on
threescore
i
went
to
and
fro
in
the
streets
of
edinburgh
all
day
long
inquiring
of
every
stranger
the
news
and
every
answer
that
i
got
was
some
new
triumph
of
dundee
no
sleep
came
to
my
burning
pillow
or
if
indeed
my
eyelids
for
very
weariness
fell
down
it
was
only
that
i
might
suffer
the
stings
of
anxiety
in
some
sharper
form
for
my
dreams
were
of
flames
kindling
around
me
through
which
i
saw
behind
the
proud
and
exulting
visage
of
dundee
sometimes
in
the
depths
of
the
night
i
rushed
into
the
street
and
i
listened
with
greedy
ears
thinking
i
heard
the
trampling
of
dragoons
and
the
heavy
wheels
of
cannon
and
often
in
the
day
when
i
saw
three
or
four
persons
speaking
together
i
ran
towards
them
and
broke
in
upon
their
discourse
with
some
wild
interrogation
that
made
them
answer
me
with
pity
but
the
haste
and
frenzy
of
this
alarm
suddenly
changed
i
felt
that
i
was
a
chosen
instrument
i
thought
that
the
ruin
which
had
fallen
on
me
and
mine
was
assuredly
some
great
mystery
of
providence
i
remembered
the
prophecy
of
my
grandfather
that
a
task
was
in
store
for
me
though
i
knew
not
what
it
was
i
forgot
my
old
age
and
my
infirmities
i
hastened
to
my
chamber
i
put
money
in
my
purse
i
spoke
to
no
one
i
bought
a
carabine
and
i
set
out
alone
to
reinforce
mackay
as
i
passed
down
the
street
and
out
at
the
i
saw
the
people
stop
and
look
at
me
with
silence
and
wonder
as
i
went
along
the
road
several
that
were
passing
inquired
where
i
was
going
so
fast
but
i
waived
my
hand
and
hurried
by
i
reached
the
queensferry
without
as
it
were
drawing
breath
i
embarked
and
when
the
boat
arrived
at
the
northern
side
i
had
fallen
asleep
and
the
ferryman
in
compassion
allowed
me
to
slumber
unmolested
when
i
awoke
i
felt
myself
refreshed
i
leapt
on
shore
and
went
again
impatiently
on
but
my
mind
was
then
somewhat
calmer
and
when
i
reached
kinross
i
bought
a
little
bread
and
retiring
to
the
brink
of
the
lake
dipped
it
in
the
water
and
it
was
a
savoury
repast
as
i
approached
the
brigg
of
earn
i
felt
age
in
my
limbs
and
though
the
spirit
was
willing
the
body
could
not
and
i
sat
down
and
i
mourned
that
i
was
so
frail
and
so
feeble
but
a
marvellous
vigour
was
soon
again
given
to
me
and
i
rose
refreshed
from
my
on
the
wall
of
the
bridge
and
the
same
night
i
reached
perth
i
stopped
in
a
stabler
till
the
morning
at
break
of
day
having
hired
a
horse
from
him
i
hastened
forward
to
dunkeld
where
he
told
me
mackay
had
encamped
the
day
before
on
his
way
to
defend
the
pass
of
killicrankie
the
road
was
thronged
with
women
and
children
flocking
into
perth
in
terror
of
the
highlanders
but
i
heeded
them
not
i
had
but
one
thought
and
that
was
to
reach
the
scene
of
war
and
claverhouse
on
arriving
at
the
ferry
of
inver
the
field
in
front
of
the
bishop
of
dunkeld
house
where
the
army
had
been
encamped
was
empty
mackay
had
marched
towards
to
drive
dundee
and
the
highlanders
if
possible
back
into
the
glens
and
mosses
of
the
north
for
he
had
learnt
that
his
own
force
greatly
exceeded
his
adversary
on
hearing
this
and
my
horse
being
in
need
of
bating
i
halted
at
the
before
crossing
the
tay
assured
by
the
boatman
that
i
should
be
able
to
overtake
the
army
long
before
it
could
reach
the
meeting
of
the
tummel
and
the
gary
and
so
it
proved
for
as
i
came
to
that
turn
of
the
road
where
the
tummel
pours
its
roaring
waters
into
the
tay
i
heard
the
echoing
of
a
trumpet
among
the
mountains
and
soon
after
saw
the
army
winding
its
toilsome
course
along
the
river
brink
slowly
and
heavily
as
the
chariots
of
pharaoh
laboured
through
the
sands
of
the
desert
and
the
appearance
of
the
long
array
was
as
the
woods
that
skirt
the
rivers
in
autumn
on
the
right
hand
hills
and
rocks
and
trees
rose
like
the
ruins
of
the
ramparts
of
some
ancient
world
and
i
thought
of
the
epochs
when
the
days
of
the
children
of
men
were
a
thousand
years
and
when
giants
were
on
the
earth
and
all
were
swept
away
by
the
flood
and
i
felt
as
if
i
beheld
the
hand
of
the
lord
in
the
cloud
weighing
the
things
of
time
in
his
scales
to
see
if
the
sins
of
the
world
were
indeed
become
again
so
great
as
that
the
cause
of
claverhouse
should
be
suffered
to
prevail
for
my
spirit
was
as
a
flame
that
blazeth
in
the
wind
and
my
thoughts
as
the
sparks
that
shoot
and
soar
for
a
moment
towards
the
skies
with
a
glorious
splendour
and
drop
down
upon
the
earth
in
ashes
chapter
xcii
general
mackay
halted
the
host
on
a
spacious
green
plain
which
lies
at
the
meeting
of
the
tummel
and
the
gary
and
which
the
highlanders
call
fascali
because
as
the
name
in
their
tongue
signifies
no
trees
are
growing
thereon
this
place
is
the
threshold
of
the
pass
of
killicrankie
through
the
dark
and
woody
chasms
of
which
the
impatient
waters
of
the
gary
come
with
hoarse
and
wrathful
mutterings
and
murmurs
the
hills
and
mountains
around
are
built
up
in
more
olden
and
antic
forms
than
those
of
our
lowland
parts
and
a
wild
and
strange
solemnity
is
mingled
there
with
much
fantastical
beauty
as
if
according
to
the
minstrelsy
of
ancient
times
sullen
wizards
and
gamesome
fairies
had
joined
their
arts
and
spells
to
make
a
common
as
the
soldiers
spread
themselves
over
the
green
bosom
of
fascali
and
piled
their
arms
and
furled
their
banners
and
laid
their
drums
on
the
ground
and
led
their
horses
to
the
river
the
general
sent
forward
a
scout
through
the
pass
to
discover
the
movements
of
claverhouse
having
heard
that
he
was
coming
from
the
castle
of
to
prevent
his
entrance
into
the
highlands
the
officer
sent
to
make
the
espial
had
not
been
gone
above
half
an
hour
when
he
came
back
in
great
haste
to
tell
that
the
highlanders
were
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
above
the
house
of
rinrorie
and
that
unless
the
pass
was
immediately
taken
possession
of
it
would
be
mastered
by
claverhouse
that
night
mackay
at
this
news
ordered
the
trumpets
to
sound
and
as
the
echoes
multiplied
and
repeated
the
alarm
it
was
as
if
all
the
spirits
of
the
hills
called
the
men
to
arms
the
soldiers
looked
around
as
they
formed
their
ranks
listening
with
delight
and
wonder
at
the
universal
bravery
and
i
thought
of
the
sight
which
elisha
the
prophet
gave
to
the
young
man
at
dothan
of
the
mountains
covered
with
horses
and
chariots
of
fire
for
his
defence
against
the
host
of
the
king
of
syria
and
i
went
forward
with
the
confidence
of
assured
victory
as
we
issued
forth
from
the
pass
into
the
wide
country
extending
towards
lude
and
we
saw
as
the
officer
had
reported
the
highland
hosts
of
claverhouse
arrayed
along
the
lofty
brow
of
the
mountain
above
the
house
of
rinrorie
their
plaids
waving
in
the
breeze
on
the
hill
and
their
arms
glittering
to
the
sun
mackay
directed
the
troops
at
crossing
a
raging
brook
called
the
girnaig
to
keep
along
a
flat
of
land
above
the
house
of
rinrorie
and
to
form
in
order
of
battle
on
the
field
beyond
the
garden
and
under
the
hill
where
the
highlanders
were
posted
the
baggage
and
camp
equipages
he
at
the
same
time
ordered
down
into
a
plain
that
lies
between
the
bank
on
the
crown
of
which
the
house
stands
and
the
river
gary
an
ancient
monumental
stone
in
the
middle
of
the
lower
plain
shows
that
in
some
elder
age
a
battle
had
been
fought
there
and
that
some
warrior
of
might
and
fame
had
fallen
in
taking
his
ground
on
that
elevated
shelf
of
land
mackay
was
minded
to
stretch
his
left
wing
to
intercept
the
return
of
the
highlanders
towards
blair
and
if
possible
oblige
them
to
enter
the
pass
of
killicrankie
by
which
he
would
have
cut
them
off
from
their
resources
in
the
north
and
so
perhaps
mastered
them
without
any
great
slaughter
but
claverhouse
discerned
the
intent
of
his
movement
and
before
our
covenanted
host
had
formed
their
array
it
was
evident
that
he
was
preparing
to
descend
and
as
a
foretaste
of
the
vehemence
wherewith
the
highlanders
were
coming
we
saw
them
rolling
large
stones
to
the
brow
of
the
hill
in
the
meantime
the
house
of
rinrorie
having
been
deserted
by
the
family
the
lady
with
her
children
and
maidens
had
fled
to
lude
or
struan
mackay
ordered
a
party
to
take
possession
of
it
and
to
post
themselves
at
the
windows
which
look
up
the
hill
i
was
among
those
who
went
into
the
house
and
my
station
was
at
the
easternmost
window
in
a
small
chamber
which
is
entered
by
two
doors
the
one
opening
from
the
and
the
other
from
the
in
this
situation
we
could
see
but
little
of
the
distribution
of
the
army
or
the
positions
that
mackay
was
taking
for
our
view
was
confined
to
the
face
of
the
hill
whereon
the
highlanders
were
busily
preparing
for
their
descent
but
i
saw
claverhouse
on
horseback
riding
to
and
fro
and
plainly
inflaming
their
valour
with
many
a
courageous
gesture
and
as
he
turned
and
winded
his
prancing
his
blazed
to
the
setting
sun
like
a
beacon
on
the
hill
when
he
had
seemingly
concluded
his
exhortation
the
highlanders
stooped
forward
and
hurled
down
the
rocks
which
they
had
gathered
for
their
forerunners
and
while
the
stones
came
leaping
and
bounding
with
a
noise
like
thunder
the
men
followed
in
thick
and
separate
bands
and
mackay
gave
the
signal
to
commence
firing
we
saw
from
the
windows
many
of
the
highlanders
at
the
first
volley
stagger
and
fall
but
the
others
came
furiously
down
and
before
the
soldiers
had
time
to
stick
their
bayonets
into
their
guns
the
broad
swords
of
the
clansmen
hewed
hundreds
to
the
ground
within
a
few
minutes
the
battle
was
general
between
the
two
armies
but
the
smoke
of
the
firing
involved
all
the
field
and
we
could
see
nothing
from
the
windows
the
echoes
of
the
mountains
raged
with
the
din
and
the
sounds
were
multiplied
by
them
in
so
many
different
places
that
we
could
not
tell
where
the
fight
was
hottest
the
whole
country
around
resounded
as
with
the
uproar
of
a
universal
battle
i
felt
the
passion
of
my
spirit
return
i
could
no
longer
restrain
myself
nor
remain
where
i
was
snatching
up
my
carabine
i
left
my
actionless
post
at
the
window
and
hurried
down
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
i
saw
by
the
flashes
through
the
smoke
that
the
firing
was
spreading
down
into
the
plain
where
the
baggage
was
stationed
and
by
this
i
knew
that
there
was
some
movement
in
the
battle
but
whether
the
highlanders
or
the
covenanters
were
shifting
their
ground
i
could
not
discover
for
the
valley
was
filled
with
smoke
and
it
was
only
at
times
that
a
sword
like
a
glance
of
lightning
could
be
seen
in
the
cloud
wherein
the
thunders
and
tempest
of
the
conflict
were
raging
chapter
xciii
as
i
stood
on
the
brow
of
the
bank
in
front
of
a
gentle
breathing
of
the
evening
air
turned
the
smoke
like
the
travelling
mist
of
the
hills
and
opening
it
here
and
there
i
had
glimpses
of
the
fighting
sometimes
i
saw
the
highlanders
driving
the
covenanters
down
the
steep
and
sometimes
i
beheld
them
in
their
turn
on
the
ground
endeavouring
to
protect
their
unbonneted
heads
with
their
targets
but
to
whom
the
victory
was
to
be
given
i
could
discern
no
sign
and
i
said
to
myself
the
prize
at
hazard
is
the
liberty
of
the
land
and
the
lord
surely
it
shall
not
be
permitted
to
the
champion
of
bondage
to
prevail
a
stronger
breathing
of
the
gale
came
rushing
along
and
the
skirts
of
the
smoke
where
the
baggage
stood
were
blown
aside
and
i
beheld
many
of
the
highlanders
among
the
wagons
plundering
and
tearing
then
i
heard
a
great
shouting
on
the
right
and
looking
that
way
i
saw
the
children
of
the
covenant
fleeing
in
remnants
across
the
lower
plain
and
making
toward
the
river
presently
i
also
saw
mackay
with
two
regiments
all
that
kept
the
order
of
discipline
also
in
the
plain
he
had
lost
the
battle
claverhouse
had
won
and
the
scattered
firing
which
was
continued
by
a
few
was
to
my
ears
as
the
riveting
of
the
shackles
on
the
arms
of
poor
scotland
for
ever
my
grief
was
unspeakable
i
ran
to
and
fro
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
and
i
stampt
with
my
feet
and
i
beat
my
breast
and
i
rubbed
my
hands
with
the
frenzy
of
despair
and
i
threw
myself
on
the
ground
and
all
the
sufferings
of
which
i
have
written
returned
upon
me
and
i
started
up
and
i
cried
aloud
the
blasphemy
of
the
fool
there
is
no
god
but
scarcely
had
the
dreadful
words
escaped
my
profane
lips
when
i
heard
as
it
were
thunders
in
the
heavens
and
the
voice
of
an
oracle
crying
in
the
ears
of
my
soul
the
victory
of
this
day
is
given
into
thy
hands
and
strange
wonder
and
awe
fell
upon
me
and
a
mighty
spirit
entered
into
mine
and
i
felt
as
if
i
was
in
that
moment
clothed
with
the
armour
of
divine
might
i
took
up
my
carabine
which
in
these
transports
had
fallen
from
my
hand
and
i
went
round
the
gable
of
the
house
into
the
garden
and
i
saw
claverhouse
with
several
of
his
officers
coming
along
the
ground
by
which
our
hosts
had
marched
to
their
position
and
ever
and
anon
turning
round
and
exhorting
his
men
to
follow
him
it
was
evident
he
was
making
for
the
pass
to
intercept
our
scattered
fugitives
from
escaping
that
way
the
garden
in
which
i
then
stood
was
surrounded
by
a
low
wall
a
small
lay
on
the
outside
between
which
and
the
garden
i
perceived
that
claverhouse
would
pass
i
prepared
my
flint
and
examined
my
and
i
walked
towards
the
top
of
the
garden
with
a
firm
step
the
ground
was
buoyant
to
my
tread
and
the
vigour
of
youth
was
renewed
in
my
aged
limbs
i
thought
that
those
for
whom
i
had
so
mourned
walked
before
me
that
they
smiled
and
beckoned
me
to
come
on
and
that
a
glorious
light
shone
around
me
claverhouse
was
coming
forward
several
officers
were
near
him
but
his
men
were
still
a
little
behind
and
seemed
inclined
to
go
down
the
hill
and
he
chided
at
their
reluctance
i
rested
my
carabine
on
the
i
bent
my
knee
and
knelt
upon
the
ground
i
aimed
and
fired
but
when
the
smoke
cleared
away
i
beheld
the
oppressor
still
proudly
on
his
i
loaded
again
again
i
knelt
and
again
rested
my
carabine
upon
the
wall
and
fired
a
second
time
and
was
again
disappointed
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
implored
the
help
of
heaven
and
i
prepared
for
the
third
time
and
when
all
was
ready
and
claverhouse
was
coming
forward
i
took
off
my
bonnet
and
kneeling
with
the
gun
in
my
hand
cried
lord
remember
david
and
all
his
afflictions
and
having
so
prayed
i
took
aim
as
i
knelt
and
claverhouse
raising
his
arm
in
command
i
fired
in
the
same
moment
i
looked
up
and
there
was
a
vision
in
the
air
as
if
all
the
angels
of
brightness
and
the
martyrs
in
their
vestments
of
glory
were
assembled
on
the
walls
and
battlements
of
heaven
to
witness
the
event
and
i
started
up
and
cried
i
have
delivered
my
native
land
but
in
the
same
instant
i
remembered
to
whom
the
glory
was
due
and
falling
again
on
my
knees
i
raised
my
hands
and
bowed
my
head
as
i
said
not
mine
o
lord
but
thine
is
the
victory
when
the
smoke
rolled
away
i
beheld
claverhouse
in
the
arms
of
his
officers
sinking
from
his
horse
and
the
blood
flowing
from
a
wound
between
the
and
the
armpit
the
same
night
he
was
summoned
to
the
audit
of
his
crimes
it
was
not
observed
by
the
officers
from
what
quarter
the
summoning
bolt
of
justice
came
but
thinking
it
was
from
the
house
every
window
was
instantly
attacked
while
i
deliberately
retired
from
the
spot
and
till
the
protection
of
the
darkness
enabled
me
to
make
my
escape
across
the
gary
and
over
the
hills
in
the
direction
i
saw
mackay
and
the
remnants
of
the
flock
taking
i
concealed
myself
among
the
bushes
and
rocks
that
overhung
the
violent
stream
of
the
girnaig
thus
was
my
avenging
vow
fulfilled
and
thus
was
my
native
land
delivered
from
bondage
for
a
time
yet
there
may
be
rumours
and
bloodshed
but
they
will
prove
as
the
wreck
which
the
waves
roll
to
the
shore
after
a
tempest
the
fortunes
of
the
papistical
stuarts
are
foundered

ever
never

know
the
inner
aspects

politics

will
undoubtedly
be
the
first

the
skill

with
which

it
is
brilliantly
written

will
afford
keen
enjoyment
to

discriminating
taste
its
satire
is
but
enough
to
hurt
no
one

its
wit

may
we
say
its
impudence
should
cause
a
run

sparkling

mr

his

the
very

mr

has
given
a
title
to
his
work
which
will
cause
many
conjectures
as
to
the
nature
of
the

now
if

what

nights

should
be
doing
the

anything
but
a
service
in

we
should
be
giving
the
whole
thing
away
therefore
we
will
only
state
that
the
work
is
cleverly
conceived

carried

the

the

can
ruin

mar

happiness
one
of
the
worst
not

towards

an
amusing

entertaining
story

in

there
are
many
pleasant

reminds
us
of

its
pictures
of
bohemian

its
group
of
generous
scribblers

playwrights
some
of
the
characters
are
so
true
to

that
it
is
impossible
not
to
recognise
them
among
the
best
incidents
in

be
mentioned
the

feeling
that
it

a
faithful

long
extract
this
volume

well
studied
and
takes
pains
to
answer
all
the
questions
that
are
usually
put
about
mr

through
with
delighted
sympathy
daily
a
very
praiseworthy
attempt
and
by
a
writer
imbued
with
a
fervent
esteem
for
his
subject
this
valuation
of
the
work
of
our
most
virile
empire
author
should
hold
the
attention
of
those
who
have
well
studied
the
subject
and
can
appreciate
accordingly
the
author
has
carefully
compiled
a

most
interesting
matter

with
care
and
conscientiousness

have
known
and
puts
together
in
a
convenient
form
many
things
which
are
of
common
knowledge
something
more
than
an
attempt
at

mr
monkshood
has
written
what
all
the
young
men
at
home
and
abroad
who
treasure
mr
kipling
writings
think
but
have
not
expressed
the
volume
is
a
striking
testimony
to
the
hold
which
work
that
is
clean
and
sane
and
virile
has
upon

both
knowledge
and

have
many
interested
and

his
works

book
should
give
its
subject
pleasure

is
very
keen
and
cordial
his
criticisms
have
some
shrewdness
too

a
passage

attract
much
attention

it
we
are
given
a
sketch
of

career
and
the
story
of
his
various
works

with
some
sane
and
balanced
criticism
the
book
is
written
brightly
thoughtfully
and
informingly
it
is
acute
in
perception
and
sympathetic
to
the
verge
of
worship
with
just
as
much
criticism
as
will
allow
that
the
hero
has
his
limitations
mr
monkshood
and
critique
possesses
undoubted
ability
and
attraction
this
work

is
highly
appreciative

received
with
enthusiasm

this
point
the

with
sufficient
forcefulness
and
originality
to
hold
the
attention
throughout
