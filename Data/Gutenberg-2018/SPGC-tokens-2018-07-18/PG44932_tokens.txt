introductory
address
i
have
come
here
partly
because
i
want
to
hear
russell
and
partly
because
of
an
old
affection
for
south
place
and
its
traditions
i
myself
have
been
for
more
than
forty
years
a
professional
teacher
and
it
is
as
a
years
ago
was
dismissed
for
refusing
religious
i
most
easily
approach
the
problem
of
free
thought
though
systems
of
education
professing
to
teach
men
and
women
how
to
think
have
been
in
use
in
europe
for
perhaps
three
thousand
years
we
have
not
yet
reached
that
degree
of
success
which
would
be
shown
if
most
educated
people
came
to
much
the
same
conclusions
on
the
great
problems
of
life
from
a
study
of
the
same
evidence
everywhere
you
have
rebels
but
ninety
per
cent
of
french
or
american
students
of
history
come
to
french
or
american
conclusions
and
per
cent
of
english
students
come
to
english
conclusions
eighty
per
cent
of
eton
boys
hold
eton
political
opinions
all
their
lives
ninety
per
cent
of
the
irish
catholic
population
of
the
united
states
seem
to
hold
generation
after
generation
identical
opinions
on
religion
and
politics
which
are
not
held
by
the
vast
majority
of
americans
it
may
be
said
that
in
these
cases
only
one
kind
of
evidence
is
allowed
to
reach
the
students
in
each
institution
but
everybody
reads
newspapers
and
talks
with
his
neighbours
and
travels
and
visits
museums
and
most
intelligent
people
read
books
and
magazines
sooner
or
later
much
of
the
same
evidence
reaches
us
all
i
myself
believe
that
one
of
the
main
reasons
why
we
do
not
to
a
greater
degree
draw
the
same
conclusions
from
that
evidence
is
that
we
do
not
really
learn
the
difficult
art
of
thought
a
boy
at
school
is
taught
to
memorize
and
to
understand
mathematical
formul√¶
or
foreign
languages
or
scientific
statements
but
in
weighing
evidence
the
effort
of
memorizing
and
even
the
effort
of
understanding
are
not
of
the
first
importance
the
effective
process
is
a
sort
of
painful
and
watchful
expectancy
a
schoolboy
or
a
college
student
finds
that
he
has
an
uncomfortable
sense
of
unreality
in
repeating
some
accustomed
formula
or
writing
an
essay
to
enforce
some
accustomed
line
of
argument
he
shrinks
from
that
feeling
as
all
animals
shrink
from
discomfort
if
he
were
taught
what
are
the
conditions
of
effective
thought
and
were
encouraged
to
act
on
that
lesson
he
would
know
that
it
is
only
by
resolutely
fastening
on
such
vague
and
painful
premonitions
and
forcing
them
to
come
into
full
consciousness
and
disclose
their
deeper
causes
and
tendencies
that
he
can
arrive
at
new
truth
or
make
some
old
truth
his
own
but
who
is
going
to
tell
him
this
secret
every
day
in
london
thousands
of
clever
and
sympathetic
boys
and
girls
begin
the
day
by
sitting
through
of
an
hour
of
the
dreary
instruction
which
consists
as
bishop
temple
once
said
of
teaching
at
everybody
s
expense
what
nobody
believes
they
may
be
conscious
or
of
a
feeling
of
unreality
but
even
if
they
have
not
been
taught
that
it
is
a
sacred
duty
to
struggle
against
doubt
they
shrink
as
the
cleverest
of
them
feel
that
the
teacher
is
shrinking
from
any
further
exploration
on
that
path
perhaps
some
day
the
teachers
and
students
of
the
ordinary
school
and
college
subjects
may
learn
something
from
those
little
isolated
institutions
where
men
and
women
try
to
prepare
themselves
for
the
creative
arts
the
young
painter
or
sculptor
or
member
of
a
group
of
young
poets
is
often
queerly
ignorant
and
but
he
lives
in
another
world
from
that
of
the
big
conventional
boy
at
harrow
or
paul
s
or
the
athlete
of
a
girls
high
school
because
he
has
felt
the
pain
and
the
exhilaration
reached
through
pain
by
which
alone
new
truth
and
new
beauty
are
born
into
the
world
free
thought
and
official
propaganda
moncure
conway
in
whose
honour
we
are
assembled
devoted
his
life
to
two
great
objects
freedom
of
thought
and
freedom
of
the
individual
in
regard
to
both
these
objects
something
has
been
gained
since
his
time
but
something
also
has
been
lost
new
dangers
somewhat
different
in
form
from
those
of
past
ages
threaten
both
kinds
of
freedom
and
unless
a
vigorous
and
vigilant
public
opinion
can
be
aroused
in
defence
of
them
there
will
be
much
less
of
both
a
hundred
years
hence
than
there
is
now
my
purpose
in
this
address
is
to
emphasize
the
new
dangers
and
to
consider
how
they
can
be
met
let
us
begin
by
trying
to
be
clear
as
to
what
we
mean
by
free
this
expression
has
two
senses
in
its
narrower
sense
it
means
thought
which
does
not
accept
the
dogmas
of
traditional
religion
in
this
sense
a
man
is
a
free
thinker
if
he
is
not
a
christian
or
a
mussulman
or
a
buddhist
or
a
shintoist
or
a
member
of
any
of
the
other
bodies
of
men
who
accept
some
inherited
orthodoxy
in
christian
countries
a
man
is
called
a
free
thinker
if
he
does
not
decidedly
believe
in
god
though
this
would
not
suffice
to
make
a
man
a
free
thinker
in
a
buddhist
country
i
do
not
wish
to
minimize
the
importance
of
free
thought
in
this
sense
i
am
myself
a
dissenter
from
all
known
religions
and
i
hope
that
every
kind
of
religious
belief
will
die
out
i
do
not
believe
that
on
the
balance
religious
belief
has
been
a
force
for
good
although
i
am
prepared
to
admit
that
in
certain
times
and
places
it
has
had
some
good
effects
i
regard
it
as
belonging
to
the
infancy
of
human
reason
and
to
a
stage
of
development
which
we
are
now
outgrowing
but
there
is
also
a
wider
sense
of
free
thought
which
i
regard
as
of
still
greater
importance
indeed
the
harm
done
by
traditional
religions
seems
chiefly
traceable
to
the
fact
that
they
have
prevented
free
thought
in
this
wider
sense
the
wider
sense
is
not
so
easy
to
define
as
the
narrower
and
it
will
be
well
to
spend
some
little
time
in
trying
to
arrive
at
its
essence
when
we
speak
of
anything
as
free
our
meaning
is
not
definite
unless
we
can
say
what
it
is
free
whatever
or
whoever
is
free
is
not
subject
to
some
external
compulsion
and
to
be
precise
we
ought
to
say
what
this
kind
of
compulsion
is
thus
thought
is
free
when
it
is
free
from
certain
kinds
of
outward
control
which
are
often
present
some
of
these
kinds
of
control
which
must
be
absent
if
thought
is
to
be
free
are
obvious
but
others
are
more
subtle
and
elusive
to
begin
with
the
most
obvious
thought
is
not
free
when
legal
penalties
are
incurred
by
the
holding
or
not
holding
of
certain
opinions
or
by
giving
expression
to
one
s
belief
or
lack
of
belief
on
certain
matters
very
few
countries
in
the
world
have
as
yet
even
this
elementary
kind
of
freedom
in
england
under
the
blasphemy
laws
it
is
illegal
to
express
disbelief
in
the
christian
religion
though
in
practice
the
law
is
not
set
in
motion
against
the
it
is
also
illegal
to
teach
what
christ
taught
on
the
subject
of
therefore
whoever
wishes
to
avoid
becoming
a
criminal
must
profess
to
agree
with
christ
s
teaching
but
must
avoid
saying
what
that
teaching
was
in
america
no
one
can
enter
the
country
without
first
solemnly
declaring
that
he
disbelieves
in
anarchism
and
polygamy
and
once
inside
he
must
also
disbelieve
in
communism
in
japan
it
is
illegal
to
express
disbelief
in
the
divinity
of
the
mikado
it
will
thus
be
seen
that
a
voyage
round
the
world
is
a
perilous
adventure
a
mohammedan
a
tolstoyan
a
bolshevik
or
a
christian
can
not
undertake
it
without
at
some
point
becoming
a
criminal
or
holding
his
tongue
about
what
he
considers
important
truths
this
of
course
applies
only
to
steerage
passengers
saloon
passengers
are
allowed
to
believe
whatever
they
please
provided
they
avoid
offensive
obtrusiveness
it
is
clear
that
the
most
elementary
condition
if
thought
is
to
be
free
is
the
absence
of
legal
penalties
for
the
expression
of
opinions
no
great
country
has
yet
reached
to
this
level
although
most
of
them
think
they
have
the
opinions
which
are
still
persecuted
strike
the
majority
as
so
monstrous
and
immoral
that
the
general
principle
of
toleration
can
not
be
held
to
apply
to
them
but
this
is
exactly
the
same
view
as
that
which
made
possible
the
tortures
of
the
inquisition
there
was
a
time
when
protestantism
seemed
as
wicked
as
bolshevism
seems
now
please
do
not
infer
from
this
remark
that
i
am
either
a
protestant
or
a
bolshevik
legal
penalties
are
however
in
the
modern
world
the
least
of
the
obstacles
to
freedom
of
thoughts
the
two
great
obstacles
are
economic
penalties
and
distortion
of
evidence
it
is
clear
that
thought
is
not
free
if
the
profession
of
certain
opinions
makes
it
impossible
to
earn
a
living
it
is
clear
also
that
thought
is
not
free
if
all
the
arguments
on
one
side
of
a
controversy
are
perpetually
presented
as
attractively
as
possible
while
the
arguments
on
the
other
side
can
only
be
discovered
by
diligent
search
both
these
obstacles
exist
in
every
large
country
known
to
me
except
china
which
is
the
last
refuge
of
freedom
it
is
these
obstacles
with
which
i
shall
be
present
magnitude
the
likelihood
of
their
increase
and
the
possibility
of
their
diminution
we
may
say
that
thought
is
free
when
it
is
exposed
to
free
competition
among
when
all
beliefs
are
able
to
state
their
case
and
no
legal
or
pecuniary
advantages
or
disadvantages
attach
to
beliefs
this
is
an
ideal
which
for
various
reasons
can
never
be
fully
attained
but
it
is
possible
to
approach
very
much
nearer
to
it
than
we
do
at
present
three
incidents
in
my
own
life
will
serve
to
show
how
in
modern
england
the
scales
are
weighted
in
favour
of
christianity
my
reason
for
mentioning
them
is
that
many
people
do
not
at
all
realize
the
disadvantages
to
which
avowed
agnosticism
still
exposes
people
the
first
incident
belongs
to
a
very
early
stage
in
my
life
my
father
was
a
freethinker
but
died
when
i
was
only
three
years
old
wishing
me
to
be
brought
up
without
superstition
he
appointed
two
freethinkers
as
my
guardians
the
courts
however
set
aside
his
will
and
had
me
educated
in
the
christian
faith
i
am
afraid
the
result
was
disappointing
but
that
was
not
the
fault
of
the
law
if
he
had
directed
that
i
should
be
educated
as
a
christadelphian
or
a
muggletonian
or
a
adventist
the
courts
would
not
have
dreamed
of
objecting
a
parent
has
a
right
to
ordain
that
any
imaginable
superstition
shall
be
instilled
into
his
children
after
his
death
but
has
not
the
right
to
say
that
they
shall
be
kept
free
from
superstition
if
possible
the
second
incident
occurred
in
the
year
i
had
at
that
time
a
desire
to
stand
for
parliament
as
a
liberal
and
the
whips
recommended
me
to
a
certain
constituency
i
addressed
the
liberal
association
who
expressed
themselves
favourably
and
my
adoption
seemed
certain
but
on
being
questioned
by
a
small
inner
caucus
i
admitted
that
i
was
an
agnostic
they
asked
whether
the
fact
would
come
out
and
i
said
it
probably
would
they
asked
whether
i
should
be
willing
to
go
to
church
occasionally
and
i
replied
that
i
should
not
consequently
they
selected
another
candidate
who
was
duly
elected
has
been
in
parliament
ever
since
and
is
a
member
of
the
present
government
the
third
incident
occurred
immediately
afterwards
i
was
invited
by
trinity
college
cambridge
to
become
a
lecturer
but
not
a
fellow
the
difference
is
not
pecuniary
it
is
that
a
fellow
has
a
voice
in
the
government
of
the
college
and
can
not
be
dispossessed
during
the
term
of
his
fellowship
except
for
grave
immorality
the
chief
reason
for
not
offering
me
a
fellowship
was
that
the
clerical
party
did
not
wish
to
add
to
the
vote
the
result
was
that
they
were
able
to
dismiss
me
in
when
they
disliked
my
views
on
the
war
if
i
had
been
dependent
on
my
lectureship
i
should
have
starved
these
three
incidents
illustrate
different
kinds
of
disadvantages
attaching
to
avowed
freethinking
even
in
modern
england
any
other
avowed
freethinker
could
supply
similar
incidents
from
his
personal
experience
often
of
a
far
more
serious
character
the
net
result
is
that
people
who
are
not
dare
not
be
frank
about
their
religious
beliefs
it
is
not
of
course
only
or
even
chiefly
in
regard
to
religion
that
there
is
lack
of
freedom
belief
in
communism
or
free
love
handicaps
a
man
much
more
than
agnosticism
not
only
is
it
a
disadvantage
to
hold
those
views
but
it
is
very
much
more
difficult
to
obtain
publicity
for
the
arguments
in
their
favour
on
the
other
hand
in
russia
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
are
exactly
reversed
comfort
and
power
are
achieved
by
professing
atheism
communism
and
free
love
and
no
opportunity
exists
for
propaganda
against
these
opinions
the
result
is
that
in
russia
one
set
of
fanatics
feels
absolute
certainty
about
one
set
of
doubtful
propositions
while
in
the
rest
of
the
world
another
set
of
fanatics
feels
equal
certainty
about
a
diametrically
opposite
set
of
equally
doubtful
propositions
from
such
a
situation
war
bitterness
and
persecution
inevitably
result
on
both
sides
william
james
used
to
preach
the
will
to
for
my
part
i
should
wish
to
preach
the
will
to
none
of
our
beliefs
are
quite
true
all
have
at
least
a
penumbra
of
vagueness
and
error
the
methods
of
increasing
the
degree
of
truth
in
our
beliefs
are
well
known
they
consist
in
hearing
all
sides
trying
to
ascertain
all
the
relevant
facts
controlling
our
own
bias
by
discussion
with
people
who
have
the
opposite
bias
and
cultivating
a
readiness
to
discard
any
hypothesis
which
has
proved
inadequate
these
methods
are
practised
in
science
and
have
built
up
the
body
of
scientific
knowledge
every
man
of
science
whose
outlook
is
truly
scientific
is
ready
to
admit
that
what
passes
for
scientific
knowledge
at
the
moment
is
sure
to
require
correction
with
the
progress
of
discovery
nevertheless
it
is
near
enough
to
the
truth
to
serve
for
most
practical
purposes
though
not
for
all
in
science
where
alone
something
approximating
to
genuine
knowledge
is
to
be
found
men
s
attitude
is
tentative
and
full
of
doubt
in
religion
and
politics
on
the
contrary
though
there
is
as
yet
nothing
approaching
scientific
knowledge
everybody
considers
it
to
have
a
dogmatic
opinion
to
be
backed
up
by
inflicting
starvation
prison
and
war
and
to
be
carefully
guarded
from
argumentative
competition
with
any
different
opinion
if
only
men
could
be
brought
into
a
tentatively
agnostic
frame
of
mind
about
these
matters
of
the
evils
of
the
modern
world
would
be
cured
war
would
become
impossible
because
each
side
would
realize
that
both
sides
must
be
in
the
wrong
persecution
would
cease
education
would
aim
at
expanding
the
mind
not
at
narrowing
it
men
would
be
chosen
for
jobs
on
account
of
fitness
to
do
the
work
not
because
they
flattered
the
irrational
dogmas
of
those
in
power
thus
rational
doubt
alone
if
it
could
be
generated
would
suffice
to
introduce
the
millennium
we
have
had
in
recent
years
a
brilliant
example
of
the
scientific
temper
of
mind
in
the
theory
of
relativity
and
its
reception
by
the
world
einstein
a
pacifist
was
appointed
to
a
research
professorship
by
the
german
government
in
the
early
days
of
the
war
his
predictions
were
verified
by
an
english
expedition
which
observed
the
eclipse
of
very
soon
after
the
armistice
his
theory
upsets
the
whole
theoretical
framework
of
traditional
physics
it
is
almost
as
damaging
to
orthodox
dynamics
as
darwin
was
to
yet
physicists
everywhere
have
shown
complete
readiness
to
accept
his
theory
as
soon
as
it
appeared
that
the
evidence
was
in
its
favour
but
none
of
them
least
of
all
einstein
himself
would
claim
that
he
has
said
the
last
word
he
has
not
built
a
monument
of
infallible
dogma
to
stand
for
all
time
there
are
difficulties
he
can
not
solve
his
doctrines
will
have
to
be
modified
in
their
turn
as
they
have
modified
newton
s
this
critical
undogmatic
receptiveness
is
the
true
attitude
of
science
what
would
have
happened
if
einstein
had
advanced
something
equally
new
in
the
sphere
of
religion
or
politics
english
people
would
have
found
elements
of
prussianism
in
his
theory
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
zionist
plot
nationalists
in
all
countries
would
have
found
it
tainted
with
pacifism
and
proclaimed
it
a
mere
dodge
for
escaping
military
service
all
the
professors
would
have
approached
scotland
yard
to
get
the
importation
of
his
writings
prohibited
teachers
favourable
to
him
would
have
been
dismissed
he
meantime
would
have
captured
the
government
of
some
backward
country
where
it
would
have
become
illegal
to
teach
anything
except
his
doctrine
which
would
have
grown
into
a
mysterious
dogma
not
understood
by
anybody
ultimately
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
his
doctrine
would
be
decided
on
the
battlefield
without
the
collection
of
any
fresh
evidence
for
or
against
it
this
method
is
the
logical
outcome
of
william
james
s
will
to
believe
what
is
wanted
is
not
the
will
to
believe
but
the
wish
to
find
out
which
is
its
exact
opposite
if
it
is
admitted
that
a
condition
of
rational
doubt
would
be
desirable
it
becomes
important
to
inquire
how
it
comes
about
that
there
is
so
much
irrational
certainty
in
the
world
a
great
deal
of
this
is
due
to
the
inherent
irrationality
and
credulity
of
average
human
nature
but
this
seed
of
intellectual
original
sin
is
nourished
and
fostered
by
other
agencies
among
which
three
play
the
chief
education
propaganda
and
economic
pressure
let
us
consider
these
in
turn
education
in
all
advanced
countries
is
in
the
hands
of
the
state
some
of
the
things
taught
are
known
to
be
false
by
the
officials
who
prescribe
them
and
many
others
are
known
to
be
false
or
at
any
rate
very
doubtful
by
every
unprejudiced
person
take
for
example
the
teaching
of
history
each
nation
aims
only
at
in
the
school
of
history
when
a
man
writes
his
autobiography
he
is
expected
to
show
a
certain
modesty
but
when
a
nation
writes
its
autobiography
there
is
no
limit
to
its
boasting
and
vainglory
when
i
was
young
school
books
taught
that
the
french
were
wicked
and
the
germans
virtuous
now
they
teach
the
opposite
in
neither
case
is
there
the
slightest
regard
for
truth
german
school
books
dealing
with
the
battle
of
waterloo
represent
wellington
as
all
but
defeated
when
bl√ºcher
saved
the
situation
english
books
represent
bl√ºcher
as
having
made
very
little
difference
the
writers
of
both
the
german
and
the
english
books
know
that
they
are
not
telling
the
truth
american
school
books
used
to
be
violently
since
the
war
they
have
become
equally
without
aiming
at
truth
in
either
case
see
both
before
and
since
one
of
the
chief
purposes
of
education
in
the
united
states
has
been
to
turn
the
motley
collection
of
immigrant
children
into
good
apparently
it
has
not
occurred
to
any
one
that
a
good
american
like
a
good
german
or
a
good
japanese
must
be
a
bad
human
being
a
good
american
is
a
man
or
woman
imbued
with
the
belief
that
america
is
the
finest
country
on
earth
and
ought
always
to
be
enthusiastically
supported
in
any
quarrel
it
is
just
possible
that
these
propositions
are
true
if
so
a
rational
man
will
have
no
quarrel
with
them
but
if
they
are
true
they
ought
to
be
taught
everywhere
not
only
in
america
it
is
a
suspicious
circumstance
that
such
propositions
are
never
believed
outside
the
particular
country
which
they
glorify
meanwhile
the
whole
machinery
of
the
state
in
all
the
different
countries
is
turned
on
to
making
defenceless
children
believe
absurd
propositions
the
effect
of
which
is
to
make
them
willing
to
die
in
defence
of
sinister
interests
under
the
impression
that
they
are
fighting
for
truth
and
right
this
is
only
one
of
countless
ways
in
which
education
is
designed
not
to
give
true
knowledge
but
to
make
the
people
pliable
to
the
will
of
their
masters
without
an
elaborate
system
of
deceit
in
the
elementary
schools
it
would
be
impossible
to
preserve
the
camouflage
of
democracy
before
leaving
the
subject
of
education
i
will
take
another
example
from
america
because
america
is
any
worse
than
other
countries
but
because
it
is
the
most
modern
showing
the
dangers
that
are
growing
rather
than
those
that
are
diminishing
in
the
state
of
new
york
a
school
can
not
be
established
without
a
licence
from
the
state
even
if
it
is
to
be
supported
wholly
by
private
funds
a
recent
law
decrees
that
a
licence
shall
not
be
granted
to
any
school
where
it
shall
appear
that
the
instruction
proposed
to
be
given
includes
the
teachings
of
the
doctrine
that
organized
governments
shall
be
overthrown
by
force
violence
or
unlawful
as
the
points
out
there
is
no
limitation
to
this
or
that
organized
government
the
law
therefore
would
have
made
it
illegal
during
the
war
to
teach
the
doctrine
that
the
kaiser
s
government
should
be
overthrown
by
force
and
since
then
the
support
of
kolchak
or
denikin
against
the
soviet
government
would
have
been
illegal
such
consequences
of
course
were
not
intended
and
result
only
from
bad
draughtsmanship
what
was
intended
appears
from
another
law
passed
at
the
same
time
applying
to
teachers
in
state
schools
this
law
provides
that
certificates
permitting
persons
to
teach
in
such
schools
shall
be
issued
only
to
those
who
have
shown
satisfactorily
that
they
are
loyal
and
obedient
to
the
government
of
this
state
and
of
the
united
states
and
shall
be
refused
to
those
who
have
advocated
no
matter
where
or
when
a
form
of
government
other
than
the
government
of
this
state
or
of
the
united
the
committee
which
framed
these
laws
as
quoted
by
the
laid
it
down
that
the
teacher
who
does
not
approve
of
the
present
social
system
must
surrender
his
office
and
that
no
person
who
is
not
eager
to
combat
the
theories
of
social
change
should
be
entrusted
with
the
task
of
fitting
the
young
and
old
for
the
responsibilities
of
thus
according
to
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
christ
and
george
washington
were
too
degraded
morally
to
be
fit
for
the
education
of
the
young
if
christ
were
to
go
to
new
york
and
say
suffer
the
little
children
to
come
unto
me
the
president
of
the
new
york
school
board
would
reply
sir
i
see
no
evidence
that
you
are
eager
to
combat
theories
of
social
change
indeed
i
have
heard
it
said
that
you
advocate
what
you
call
the
of
heaven
whereas
this
country
thank
god
is
a
republic
it
is
clear
that
the
government
of
your
kingdom
of
heaven
would
differ
materially
from
that
of
new
york
state
therefore
no
children
will
be
allowed
access
to
if
he
failed
to
make
this
reply
he
would
not
be
doing
his
duty
as
a
functionary
entrusted
with
the
administration
of
the
law
the
effect
of
such
laws
is
very
serious
let
it
be
granted
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
government
and
the
social
system
in
the
state
of
new
york
are
the
best
that
have
ever
existed
on
this
planet
yet
even
then
both
would
presumably
be
capable
of
improvement
any
person
who
admits
this
obvious
proposition
is
by
law
incapable
of
teaching
in
a
state
school
thus
the
law
decrees
that
the
teachers
shall
all
be
either
hypocrites
or
fools
the
growing
danger
exemplified
by
the
new
york
law
is
that
resulting
from
the
monopoly
of
power
in
the
hands
of
a
single
organization
whether
the
state
or
a
trust
or
federation
of
trusts
in
the
case
of
education
the
power
is
in
the
hands
of
the
state
which
can
prevent
the
young
from
hearing
of
any
doctrine
which
it
dislikes
i
believe
there
are
still
some
people
who
think
that
a
democratic
state
is
scarcely
distinguishable
from
the
people
this
however
is
a
delusion
the
state
is
a
collection
of
officials
different
for
different
purposes
drawing
comfortable
incomes
so
long
as
the
is
preserved
the
only
alteration
they
are
likely
to
desire
in
the
is
an
increase
of
bureaucracy
and
of
the
power
of
bureaucrats
it
is
therefore
natural
that
they
should
take
advantage
of
such
opportunities
as
war
excitement
to
acquire
inquisitorial
powers
over
their
employees
involving
the
right
to
inflict
starvation
upon
any
subordinate
who
opposes
them
in
matters
of
the
mind
such
as
education
this
state
of
affairs
is
fatal
it
puts
an
end
to
all
possibility
of
progress
or
freedom
or
intellectual
initiative
yet
it
is
the
natural
result
of
allowing
the
whole
of
elementary
education
to
fall
under
the
sway
of
a
single
organization
religious
toleration
to
a
certain
extent
has
been
won
because
people
have
ceased
to
consider
religion
so
important
as
it
was
once
thought
to
be
but
in
politics
and
economics
which
have
taken
the
place
formerly
occupied
by
religion
there
is
a
growing
tendency
to
persecution
which
is
not
by
any
means
confined
to
one
party
the
persecution
of
opinion
in
russia
is
more
severe
than
in
any
capitalist
country
i
met
in
petrograd
an
eminent
russian
poet
alexander
block
who
has
since
died
as
the
result
of
privations
the
bolsheviks
allowed
him
to
teach
√¶sthetics
but
he
complained
that
they
insisted
on
his
teaching
the
subject
from
a
marxian
point
of
he
had
been
at
a
loss
to
discover
how
the
theory
of
rhythmics
was
connected
with
marxism
although
to
avoid
starvation
he
had
done
his
best
to
find
out
of
course
it
has
been
impossible
in
russia
ever
since
the
bolsheviks
came
into
power
to
print
anything
critical
of
the
dogmas
upon
which
their
regime
is
founded
the
examples
of
america
and
russia
illustrate
the
conclusion
to
which
we
seem
to
be
that
so
long
as
men
continue
to
have
the
present
fanatical
belief
in
the
importance
of
politics
free
thought
on
political
matters
will
be
impossible
and
there
is
only
too
much
danger
that
the
lack
of
freedom
will
spread
to
all
other
matters
as
it
has
done
in
russia
only
some
degree
of
political
scepticism
can
save
us
from
this
misfortune
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
officials
in
charge
of
education
desire
the
young
to
become
educated
on
the
contrary
their
problem
is
to
impart
information
without
imparting
intelligence
education
should
have
two
objects
first
to
give
definite
and
writing
languages
and
mathematics
and
so
on
secondly
to
create
those
mental
habits
which
will
enable
people
to
acquire
knowledge
and
form
sound
judgments
for
themselves
the
first
of
these
we
may
call
information
the
second
intelligence
the
utility
of
information
is
admitted
practically
as
well
as
theoretically
without
a
literate
population
a
modern
state
is
impossible
but
the
utility
of
intelligence
is
admitted
only
theoretically
not
practically
it
is
not
desired
that
ordinary
people
should
think
for
themselves
because
it
is
felt
that
people
who
think
for
themselves
are
awkward
to
manage
and
cause
administrative
difficulties
only
the
guardians
in
plato
s
language
are
to
think
the
rest
are
to
obey
or
to
follow
leaders
like
a
herd
of
sheep
this
doctrine
often
unconsciously
has
survived
the
introduction
of
political
democracy
and
has
radically
vitiated
all
national
systems
of
education
the
country
which
has
succeeded
best
in
giving
information
without
intelligence
is
the
latest
addition
to
modern
civilization
japan
elementary
education
in
japan
is
said
to
be
admirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
instruction
but
in
addition
to
instruction
it
has
another
purpose
which
is
to
teach
worship
of
the
far
stronger
creed
now
than
before
japan
became
modernized
thus
the
schools
have
been
used
simultaneously
to
confer
knowledge
and
to
promote
superstition
since
we
are
not
tempted
to
we
see
clearly
what
is
absurd
in
japanese
teaching
our
own
national
superstitions
strike
us
as
natural
and
sensible
so
that
we
do
not
take
such
a
true
view
of
them
as
we
do
of
the
superstitions
of
nippon
but
if
a
travelled
japanese
were
to
maintain
the
thesis
that
our
schools
teach
superstitions
just
as
inimical
to
intelligence
as
belief
in
the
divinity
of
the
mikado
i
suspect
that
he
would
be
able
to
make
out
a
very
good
case
for
the
present
i
am
not
in
search
of
remedies
but
am
only
concerned
with
diagnosis
we
are
faced
with
the
paradoxical
fact
that
education
has
become
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
to
intelligence
and
freedom
of
thought
this
is
due
primarily
to
the
fact
that
the
state
claims
a
monopoly
but
that
is
by
no
means
the
sole
cause
system
of
education
turns
young
people
out
of
the
schools
able
to
read
but
for
the
most
part
unable
to
weigh
evidence
or
to
form
an
independent
opinion
they
are
then
assailed
throughout
the
rest
of
their
lives
by
statements
designed
to
make
them
believe
all
sorts
of
absurd
propositions
such
as
that
blank
s
pills
cure
all
ills
that
spitzbergen
is
warm
and
fertile
and
that
germans
eat
corpses
the
art
of
propaganda
as
practised
by
modern
politicians
and
governments
is
derived
from
the
art
of
advertisement
the
science
of
psychology
owes
a
great
deal
to
advertisers
in
former
days
most
psychologists
would
probably
have
thought
that
a
man
could
not
convince
many
people
of
the
excellence
of
his
own
wares
by
merely
stating
emphatically
that
they
were
excellent
experience
shows
however
that
they
were
mistaken
in
this
if
i
were
to
stand
up
once
in
a
public
place
and
state
that
i
am
the
most
modest
man
alive
i
should
be
laughed
at
but
if
i
could
raise
enough
money
to
make
the
same
statement
on
all
the
busses
and
on
hoardings
along
all
the
principal
railway
lines
people
would
presently
become
convinced
that
i
had
an
abnormal
shrinking
from
publicity
if
i
were
to
go
to
a
small
shopkeeper
and
say
look
at
your
competitor
over
the
way
he
is
getting
your
business
don
t
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
leave
your
business
and
stand
up
in
the
middle
of
the
road
and
try
to
shoot
him
before
he
shoots
you
i
were
to
say
this
any
small
shopkeeper
would
think
me
mad
but
when
the
government
says
it
with
emphasis
and
a
brass
band
the
small
shopkeepers
become
enthusiastic
and
are
quite
surprised
when
they
find
afterwards
that
business
has
suffered
propaganda
conducted
by
the
means
which
advertisers
have
found
successful
is
now
one
of
the
recognized
methods
of
government
in
all
advanced
countries
and
is
especially
the
method
by
which
democratic
opinion
is
created
there
are
two
quite
different
evils
about
propaganda
as
now
practised
on
the
one
hand
its
appeal
is
generally
to
irrational
causes
of
belief
rather
than
to
serious
argument
on
the
other
hand
it
gives
an
unfair
advantage
to
those
who
can
obtain
most
publicity
whether
through
wealth
or
through
power
for
my
part
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
too
much
fuss
is
sometimes
made
about
the
fact
that
propaganda
appeals
to
emotion
rather
than
reason
the
line
between
emotion
and
reason
is
not
so
sharp
as
some
people
think
moreover
a
clever
man
could
frame
a
sufficiently
rational
argument
in
favour
of
any
position
which
has
any
chance
of
being
adopted
there
are
always
good
arguments
on
both
sides
of
any
real
issue
definite
of
fact
can
be
legitimately
objected
to
but
they
are
by
no
means
necessary
the
mere
words
pear
s
soap
which
affirm
nothing
cause
people
to
buy
that
article
if
wherever
these
words
appear
they
were
replaced
by
the
words
the
labour
party
millions
of
people
would
be
led
to
vote
for
the
labour
party
although
the
advertisements
had
claimed
no
merit
for
it
whatever
but
if
both
sides
in
a
controversy
were
confined
by
law
to
statements
which
a
committee
of
eminent
logicians
considered
relevant
and
valid
the
main
evil
of
propaganda
as
at
present
conducted
would
remain
suppose
under
such
a
law
two
parties
with
an
equally
good
case
one
of
whom
had
a
million
pounds
to
spend
on
propaganda
while
the
other
had
only
a
hundred
thousand
it
is
obvious
that
the
arguments
in
favour
of
the
richer
party
would
become
more
widely
known
than
those
in
favour
of
the
poorer
party
and
therefore
the
richer
party
would
win
this
situation
is
of
course
intensified
when
one
party
is
the
government
in
russia
the
government
has
an
almost
complete
monopoly
of
propaganda
but
that
is
not
necessary
the
advantages
which
it
possesses
over
its
opponents
will
generally
be
sufficient
to
give
it
the
victory
unless
it
has
an
exceptionally
bad
case
the
objection
to
propaganda
is
not
only
its
appeal
to
unreason
but
still
more
the
unfair
advantage
which
it
gives
to
the
rich
and
powerful
equality
of
opportunity
among
opinions
is
essential
if
there
is
to
be
real
freedom
of
thought
and
equality
of
opportunity
among
opinions
can
only
be
secured
by
elaborate
laws
directed
to
that
end
which
there
is
no
reason
to
expect
to
see
enacted
the
cure
is
not
to
be
sought
primarily
in
such
laws
but
in
better
education
and
a
more
sceptical
public
opinion
for
the
moment
however
i
am
not
concerned
to
discuss
cures
have
already
dealt
with
some
aspects
of
this
obstacle
to
freedom
of
thought
but
i
wish
now
to
deal
with
it
on
more
general
lines
as
a
danger
which
is
bound
to
increase
unless
very
definite
steps
are
taken
to
counteract
it
the
supreme
example
of
economic
pressure
applied
against
freedom
of
thought
is
soviet
russia
where
until
the
trade
agreement
the
government
could
and
did
inflict
starvation
upon
people
whose
opinions
it
example
kropotkin
but
in
this
respect
russia
is
only
somewhat
ahead
of
other
countries
in
france
during
the
dreyfus
affair
any
teacher
would
have
lost
his
position
if
he
had
been
in
favour
of
dreyfus
at
the
start
or
against
him
at
the
end
in
america
at
the
present
day
i
doubt
if
a
university
professor
however
eminent
could
get
employment
if
he
were
to
criticize
the
standard
oil
company
because
all
college
presidents
have
received
or
hope
to
receive
benefactions
from
rockefeller
throughout
america
socialists
are
marked
men
and
find
it
extremely
difficult
to
obtain
work
unless
they
have
great
gifts
the
tendency
which
exists
wherever
industrialism
is
well
developed
for
trusts
and
monopolies
to
control
all
industry
leads
to
a
diminution
of
the
number
of
possible
employers
so
that
it
becomes
easier
and
easier
to
keep
secret
black
books
by
means
of
which
any
one
not
subservient
to
the
great
corporations
can
be
starved
the
growth
of
monopolies
is
introducing
in
america
many
of
the
evils
associated
with
state
socialism
as
it
has
existed
in
russia
from
the
standpoint
of
liberty
it
makes
no
difference
to
a
man
whether
his
only
possible
employer
is
the
state
or
a
trust
in
america
which
is
the
most
advanced
country
industrially
and
to
a
lesser
extent
in
other
countries
which
are
approximating
to
the
american
condition
it
is
necessary
for
the
average
citizen
if
he
wishes
to
make
a
living
to
avoid
incurring
the
hostility
of
certain
big
men
and
these
big
men
have
an
moral
and
which
they
expect
their
employees
to
agree
at
least
outwardly
a
man
who
openly
dissents
from
christianity
or
believes
in
a
relaxation
of
the
marriage
laws
or
objects
to
the
power
of
the
great
corporations
finds
america
a
very
uncomfortable
country
unless
he
happens
to
be
an
eminent
writer
exactly
the
same
kind
of
restraints
upon
freedom
of
thought
are
bound
to
occur
in
every
country
where
economic
organization
has
been
carried
to
the
point
of
practical
monopoly
therefore
the
safeguarding
of
liberty
in
the
world
which
is
growing
up
is
far
more
difficult
than
it
was
in
the
nineteenth
century
when
free
competition
was
still
a
reality
whoever
cares
about
the
freedom
of
the
mind
must
face
this
situation
fully
and
frankly
realizing
the
inapplicability
of
methods
which
answered
well
enough
while
industrialism
was
in
its
infancy
there
are
two
simple
principles
which
if
they
were
adopted
would
solve
almost
all
social
problems
the
first
is
that
education
should
have
for
one
of
its
aims
to
teach
people
only
to
believe
propositions
when
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
they
are
true
the
second
is
that
jobs
should
be
given
solely
for
fitness
to
do
the
work
to
take
the
second
point
first
the
habit
of
considering
a
man
s
religious
moral
and
political
opinions
before
appointing
him
to
a
post
or
giving
him
a
job
is
the
modern
form
of
persecution
and
it
is
likely
to
become
quite
as
efficient
as
the
inquisition
ever
was
the
old
liberties
can
be
legally
retained
without
being
of
the
slightest
use
if
in
practice
certain
opinions
lead
a
man
to
starve
it
is
poor
comfort
to
him
to
know
that
his
opinions
are
not
punishable
by
law
there
is
a
certain
public
feeling
against
starving
men
for
not
belonging
to
the
church
of
england
or
for
holding
slightly
unorthodox
opinions
in
politics
but
there
is
hardly
any
feeling
against
the
rejection
of
atheists
or
mormons
extreme
communists
or
men
who
advocate
free
love
such
men
are
thought
to
be
wicked
and
it
is
considered
only
natural
to
refuse
to
employ
them
people
have
hardly
yet
waked
up
to
the
fact
that
this
refusal
in
a
highly
industrial
state
amounts
to
a
very
rigorous
form
of
persecution
if
this
danger
were
adequately
realized
it
would
be
possible
to
rouse
public
opinion
and
to
secure
that
a
man
s
beliefs
should
not
be
considered
in
appointing
him
to
a
post
the
protection
of
minorities
is
vitally
important
and
even
the
most
orthodox
of
us
may
find
himself
in
a
minority
some
day
so
that
we
all
have
an
interest
in
restraining
the
tyranny
of
majorities
nothing
except
public
opinion
can
solve
this
problem
socialism
would
make
it
somewhat
more
acute
since
it
would
eliminate
the
opportunities
that
now
arise
through
exceptional
employers
every
increase
in
the
size
of
industrial
undertakings
makes
it
worse
since
it
diminishes
the
number
of
independent
employers
the
battle
must
be
fought
exactly
as
the
battle
of
religious
toleration
was
fought
and
as
in
that
case
so
in
this
a
decay
in
the
intensity
of
belief
is
likely
to
prove
the
decisive
factor
while
men
were
convinced
of
the
absolute
truth
of
catholicism
or
protestantism
as
the
case
might
be
they
were
willing
to
persecute
on
account
of
them
while
men
are
quite
certain
of
their
modern
creeds
they
will
persecute
on
their
behalf
some
element
of
doubt
is
essential
to
the
practice
though
not
to
the
theory
of
toleration
and
this
brings
me
to
my
other
point
which
concerns
the
aims
of
education
if
there
is
to
be
toleration
in
the
world
one
of
the
things
taught
in
schools
must
be
the
habit
of
weighing
evidence
and
the
practice
of
not
giving
full
assent
to
propositions
which
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
true
for
example
the
art
of
reading
the
newspapers
should
be
taught
the
schoolmaster
should
select
some
incident
which
happened
a
good
many
years
ago
and
roused
political
passions
in
its
day
he
should
then
read
to
the
school
children
what
was
said
by
the
newspapers
on
one
side
what
was
said
by
those
on
the
other
and
some
impartial
account
of
what
really
happened
he
should
show
how
from
the
biased
account
of
either
side
a
practised
reader
could
infer
what
really
happened
and
he
should
make
them
understand
that
everything
in
newspapers
is
more
or
less
untrue
the
cynical
scepticism
which
would
result
from
this
teaching
would
make
the
children
in
later
life
immune
from
those
appeals
to
idealism
by
which
decent
people
are
induced
to
further
the
schemes
of
scoundrels
history
should
be
taught
in
the
same
way
napoleon
s
campaigns
of
and
for
instance
might
be
studied
in
the
leading
up
to
the
surprise
which
parisians
felt
when
they
saw
the
allies
arriving
under
the
walls
of
paris
after
they
had
according
to
the
official
bulletins
been
beaten
by
napoleon
in
every
battle
in
the
more
advanced
classes
students
should
be
encouraged
to
count
the
number
of
times
that
lenin
has
been
assassinated
by
trotsky
in
order
to
learn
contempt
for
death
finally
they
should
be
given
a
school
history
approved
by
the
government
and
asked
to
infer
what
a
french
school
history
would
say
about
our
wars
with
france
all
this
would
be
a
far
better
training
in
citizenship
than
the
trite
moral
maxims
by
which
some
people
believe
that
civic
duty
can
be
inculcated
it
must
i
think
be
admitted
that
the
evils
of
the
world
are
due
to
moral
defects
quite
as
much
as
to
lack
of
intelligence
but
the
human
race
has
not
hitherto
discovered
any
method
of
eradicating
moral
defects
preaching
and
exhortation
only
add
hypocrisy
to
the
previous
list
of
vices
intelligence
on
the
contrary
is
easily
improved
by
methods
known
to
every
competent
educator
therefore
until
some
method
of
teaching
virtue
has
been
discovered
progress
will
have
to
be
sought
by
improvement
of
intelligence
rather
than
of
morals
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
to
intelligence
is
credulity
and
credulity
could
be
enormously
diminished
by
instruction
as
to
the
prevalent
forms
of
mendacity
credulity
is
a
greater
evil
in
the
present
day
than
it
ever
was
before
because
owing
to
the
growth
of
education
it
is
much
easier
than
it
used
to
be
to
spread
misinformation
and
owing
to
democracy
the
spread
of
misinformation
is
more
important
than
in
former
times
to
the
holders
of
power
hence
the
increase
in
the
circulation
of
newspapers
if
i
am
asked
how
the
world
is
to
be
induced
to
adopt
these
two
that
jobs
should
be
given
to
people
on
account
of
their
fitness
to
perform
them
that
one
aim
of
education
should
be
to
cure
people
of
the
habit
of
believing
propositions
for
which
there
is
no
can
only
say
that
it
must
be
done
by
generating
an
enlightened
public
opinion
and
an
enlightened
public
opinion
can
only
be
generated
by
the
efforts
of
those
who
desire
that
it
should
exist
i
do
not
believe
that
the
economic
changes
advocated
by
socialists
will
of
themselves
do
anything
towards
curing
the
evils
we
have
been
considering
i
think
that
whatever
happens
in
politics
the
trend
of
economic
development
will
make
the
preservation
of
mental
freedom
increasingly
difficult
unless
public
opinion
insists
that
the
employer
shall
control
nothing
in
the
life
of
the
employee
except
his
work
freedom
in
education
could
easily
be
secured
if
it
were
desired
by
limiting
the
function
of
the
state
to
inspection
and
payment
and
confining
inspection
rigidly
to
the
definite
instruction
but
that
as
things
stand
would
leave
education
in
the
hands
of
the
churches
because
unfortunately
they
are
more
anxious
to
teach
their
beliefs
than
freethinkers
are
to
teach
their
doubts
it
would
however
give
a
free
field
and
would
make
it
possible
for
a
liberal
education
to
be
given
if
it
were
really
desired
more
than
that
ought
not
to
be
asked
of
the
law
my
plea
throughout
this
address
has
been
for
the
spread
of
the
scientific
temper
which
is
an
altogether
different
thing
from
the
knowledge
of
scientific
results
the
scientific
temper
is
capable
of
regenerating
mankind
and
providing
an
issue
for
all
our
troubles
the
results
of
science
in
the
form
of
mechanism
poison
gas
and
the
yellow
press
bid
fair
to
lead
to
the
total
downfall
of
our
civilization
it
is
a
curious
antithesis
which
a
martian
might
contemplate
with
amused
detachment
but
for
us
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
upon
its
issue
depends
the
question
whether
our
grandchildren
are
to
live
in
a
happier
world
or
are
to
exterminate
each
other
by
scientific
methods
leaving
perhaps
to
negroes
and
papuans

future
