my
first
summer
in
the
sierra
chapter
i
through
the
foothills
with
a
flock
of
sheep
in
the
great
central
valley
of
california
there
are
only
two
seasons
spring
and
summer
the
spring
begins
with
the
first
rainstorm
which
usually
falls
in
november
in
a
few
months
the
wonderful
flowery
vegetation
is
in
full
bloom
and
by
the
end
of
may
it
is
dead
and
dry
and
crisp
as
if
every
plant
had
been
roasted
in
an
oven
then
the
lolling
panting
flocks
and
herds
are
driven
to
the
high
cool
green
pastures
of
the
sierra
i
was
longing
for
the
mountains
about
this
time
but
money
was
scarce
and
i
could
see
how
a
bread
supply
was
to
be
kept
up
while
i
was
anxiously
brooding
on
the
bread
problem
so
troublesome
to
wanderers
and
trying
to
believe
that
i
might
learn
to
live
like
the
wild
animals
gleaning
nourishment
here
and
there
from
seeds
berries
sauntering
and
climbing
in
joyful
independence
of
money
or
baggage
delaney
a
for
whom
i
had
worked
a
few
weeks
called
on
me
and
offered
to
engage
me
to
go
with
his
shepherd
and
flock
to
the
headwaters
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
rivers
the
very
region
i
had
most
in
mind
i
was
in
the
mood
to
accept
work
of
any
kind
that
would
take
me
into
the
mountains
whose
treasures
i
had
tasted
last
summer
in
the
yosemite
region
the
flock
he
explained
would
be
moved
gradually
higher
through
the
successive
forest
belts
as
the
snow
melted
stopping
for
a
few
weeks
at
the
best
places
we
came
to
these
i
thought
would
be
good
centers
of
observation
from
which
i
might
be
able
to
make
many
telling
excursions
within
a
radius
of
eight
or
ten
miles
of
the
camps
to
learn
something
of
the
plants
animals
and
rocks
for
he
assured
me
that
i
should
be
left
perfectly
free
to
follow
my
studies
i
judged
however
that
i
was
in
no
way
the
right
man
for
the
place
and
freely
explained
my
shortcomings
confessing
that
i
was
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
topography
of
the
upper
mountains
the
streams
that
would
have
to
be
crossed
and
the
wild
animals
etc
in
short
that
what
with
bears
coyotes
rivers
ca単ons
and
thorny
bewildering
chaparral
i
feared
that
half
or
more
of
his
flock
would
be
lost
fortunately
these
shortcomings
seemed
insignificant
to
delaney
the
main
thing
he
said
was
to
have
a
man
about
the
camp
whom
he
could
trust
to
see
that
the
shepherd
did
his
duty
and
he
assured
me
that
the
difficulties
that
seemed
so
formidable
at
a
distance
would
vanish
as
we
went
on
encouraging
me
further
by
saying
that
the
shepherd
would
do
all
the
herding
that
i
could
study
plants
and
rocks
and
scenery
as
much
as
i
liked
and
that
he
would
himself
accompany
us
to
the
first
main
camp
and
make
occasional
visits
to
our
higher
ones
to
replenish
our
store
of
provisions
and
see
how
we
prospered
therefore
i
concluded
to
go
though
still
fearing
when
i
saw
the
silly
sheep
bouncing
one
by
one
through
the
narrow
gate
of
the
home
corral
to
be
counted
that
of
the
two
thousand
and
fifty
many
would
never
return
i
was
fortunate
in
getting
a
fine
bernard
dog
for
a
companion
his
master
a
hunter
with
whom
i
was
slightly
acquainted
came
to
me
as
soon
as
he
heard
that
i
was
going
to
spend
the
summer
in
the
sierra
and
begged
me
to
take
his
favorite
dog
carlo
with
me
for
he
feared
that
if
he
were
compelled
to
stay
all
summer
on
the
plains
the
fierce
heat
might
be
the
death
of
him
i
think
i
can
trust
you
to
be
kind
to
him
he
said
and
i
am
sure
he
will
be
good
to
you
he
knows
all
about
the
mountain
animals
will
guard
the
camp
assist
in
managing
the
sheep
and
in
every
way
be
found
able
and
faithful
carlo
knew
we
were
talking
about
him
watched
our
faces
and
listened
so
attentively
that
i
fancied
he
understood
us
calling
him
by
name
i
asked
him
if
he
was
willing
to
go
with
me
he
looked
me
in
the
face
with
eyes
expressing
wonderful
intelligence
then
turned
to
his
master
and
after
permission
was
given
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
toward
me
and
a
farewell
patting
caress
he
quietly
followed
me
as
if
he
perfectly
understood
all
that
had
been
said
and
had
known
me
always
this
morning
provisions
blankets
were
packed
on
two
horses
the
flock
headed
for
the
tawny
foothills
and
away
we
sauntered
in
a
cloud
of
dust
delaney
bony
and
tall
with
sharply
hacked
profile
like
don
quixote
leading
the
billy
the
proud
shepherd
a
chinaman
and
a
digger
indian
to
assist
in
driving
for
the
first
few
days
in
the
brushy
foothills
and
myself
with
notebook
tied
to
my
belt
the
home
ranch
from
which
we
set
out
is
on
the
south
side
of
the
tuolumne
river
near
french
bar
where
the
foothills
of
metamorphic
slates
dip
below
the
stratified
deposits
of
the
central
valley
we
had
not
gone
more
than
a
mile
before
some
of
the
old
leaders
of
the
flock
showed
by
the
eager
inquiring
way
they
ran
and
looked
ahead
that
they
were
thinking
of
the
high
pastures
they
had
enjoyed
last
summer
soon
the
whole
flock
seemed
to
be
hopefully
excited
the
mothers
calling
their
lambs
the
lambs
replying
in
tones
wonderfully
human
their
fondly
quavering
calls
interrupted
now
and
then
by
hastily
snatched
mouthfuls
of
withered
grass
amid
all
this
seeming
babel
of
baas
as
they
streamed
over
the
hills
every
mother
and
child
recognized
each
other
voice
in
case
a
tired
lamb
half
asleep
in
the
smothering
dust
should
fail
to
answer
its
mother
would
come
running
back
through
the
flock
toward
the
spot
whence
its
last
response
was
heard
and
refused
to
be
comforted
until
she
found
it
the
one
of
a
thousand
though
to
our
eyes
and
ears
all
seemed
alike
the
flock
traveled
at
the
rate
of
about
a
mile
an
hour
outspread
in
the
form
of
an
irregular
triangle
about
a
hundred
yards
wide
at
the
base
and
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
long
with
a
crooked
point
made
up
of
the
strongest
foragers
called
the
leaders
which
with
the
most
active
of
those
scattered
along
the
ragged
sides
of
the
main
body
hastily
explored
nooks
in
the
rocks
and
bushes
for
grass
and
leaves
the
lambs
and
feeble
old
mothers
dawdling
in
the
rear
were
called
the
tail
end
illustration
in
the
about
noon
the
heat
was
hard
to
bear
the
poor
sheep
panted
pitifully
and
tried
to
stop
in
the
shade
of
every
tree
they
came
to
while
we
gazed
with
eager
longing
through
the
dim
burning
glare
toward
the
snowy
mountains
and
streams
though
not
one
was
in
sight
the
landscape
is
only
wavering
foothills
roughened
here
and
there
with
bushes
and
trees
and
outcropping
masses
of
slate
the
trees
mostly
the
blue
oak
are
about
thirty
to
forty
feet
high
with
pale
leaves
and
white
bark
sparsely
planted
on
the
thinnest
soil
or
in
crevices
of
rocks
beyond
the
reach
of
grass
fires
the
slates
in
many
places
rise
abruptly
through
the
tawny
grass
in
sharp
slabs
like
tombstones
in
deserted
with
the
exception
of
the
oak
and
four
or
five
species
of
manzanita
and
ceanothus
the
vegetation
of
the
foothills
is
mostly
the
same
as
that
of
the
plains
i
saw
this
region
in
the
early
spring
when
it
was
a
charming
landscape
garden
full
of
birds
and
bees
and
flowers
now
the
scorching
weather
makes
everything
dreary
the
ground
is
full
of
cracks
lizards
glide
about
on
the
rocks
and
ants
in
amazing
numbers
whose
tiny
sparks
of
life
only
burn
the
brighter
with
the
heat
fairly
quiver
with
unquenchable
energy
as
they
run
in
long
lines
to
fight
and
gather
food
how
it
comes
that
they
do
not
dry
to
a
crisp
in
a
few
seconds
exposure
to
such
is
marvelous
a
few
rattlesnakes
lie
coiled
in
places
but
are
seldom
seen
magpies
and
crows
usually
so
noisy
are
silent
now
standing
in
mixed
flocks
on
the
ground
beneath
the
best
shade
trees
with
bills
wide
open
and
wings
drooped
too
breathless
to
speak
the
quails
also
are
trying
to
keep
in
the
shade
about
the
few
tepid
alkaline
cottontail
rabbits
are
running
from
shade
to
shade
among
the
ceanothus
brush
and
occasionally
the
hare
is
seen
cantering
gracefully
across
the
wider
openings
after
a
short
noon
rest
in
a
grove
the
poor
flock
was
again
driven
ahead
over
the
brushy
hills
but
the
dim
roadway
we
had
been
following
faded
away
just
where
it
was
most
needed
compelling
us
to
stop
to
look
about
us
and
get
our
bearings
the
chinaman
seemed
to
think
we
were
lost
and
chattered
in
pidgin
english
concerning
the
abundance
of
litty
stick
chaparral
while
the
indian
silently
scanned
the
billowy
ridges
and
gulches
for
openings
pushing
through
the
thorny
jungle
we
at
length
discovered
a
road
trending
toward
coulterville
which
we
followed
until
an
hour
before
sunset
when
we
reached
a
dry
ranch
and
camped
for
the
night
camping
in
the
foothills
with
a
flock
of
sheep
is
simple
and
easy
but
far
from
pleasant
the
sheep
were
allowed
to
pick
what
they
could
find
in
the
neighborhood
until
after
sunset
watched
by
the
shepherd
while
the
others
gathered
wood
made
a
fire
cooked
unpacked
and
fed
the
horses
etc
about
dusk
the
weary
sheep
were
gathered
on
the
highest
open
spot
near
camp
where
they
willingly
bunched
close
together
and
after
each
mother
had
found
her
lamb
and
suckled
it
all
lay
down
and
required
no
attention
until
morning
supper
was
announced
by
the
call
grub
each
with
a
tin
plate
helped
himself
direct
from
the
pots
and
pans
while
chatting
about
such
camp
studies
as
mines
coyotes
bears
or
adventures
during
the
memorable
gold
days
of
pay
dirt
the
indian
kept
in
the
background
saying
never
a
word
as
if
he
belonged
to
another
species
the
meal
finished
the
dogs
were
fed
the
smokers
smoked
by
the
fire
and
under
the
influences
of
fullness
and
tobacco
the
calm
that
settled
on
their
faces
seemed
almost
divine
something
like
the
mellow
meditative
glow
portrayed
on
the
countenances
of
saints
then
suddenly
as
if
awakening
from
a
dream
each
with
a
sigh
or
a
grunt
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
pipe
yawned
gazed
at
the
fire
a
few
moments
said
well
i
believe
i
turn
in
and
straightway
vanished
beneath
his
blankets
the
fire
smouldered
and
flickered
an
hour
or
two
longer
the
stars
shone
brighter
coons
coyotes
and
owls
stirred
the
silence
here
and
there
while
crickets
and
hylas
made
a
cheerful
continuous
music
so
fitting
and
full
that
it
seemed
a
part
of
the
very
body
of
the
night
the
only
discordance
came
from
a
snoring
sleeper
and
the
coughing
sheep
with
dust
in
their
throats
in
the
starlight
the
flock
looked
like
a
big
gray
blanket
the
camp
was
astir
at
daybreak
coffee
bacon
and
beans
formed
the
breakfast
followed
by
quick
and
packing
a
general
bleating
began
about
sunrise
as
soon
as
a
mother
ewe
arose
her
lamb
came
bounding
and
bunting
for
its
breakfast
and
after
the
thousand
youngsters
had
been
suckled
the
flock
began
to
nibble
and
spread
the
restless
wethers
with
ravenous
appetites
were
the
first
to
move
but
dared
not
go
far
from
the
main
body
billy
and
the
indian
and
the
chinaman
kept
them
headed
along
the
weary
road
and
allowed
them
to
pick
up
what
little
they
could
find
on
a
breadth
of
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
but
as
several
flocks
had
already
gone
ahead
of
us
scarce
a
leaf
green
or
dry
was
left
therefore
the
starving
flock
had
to
be
hurried
on
over
the
bare
hot
hills
to
the
nearest
of
the
green
pastures
about
twenty
or
thirty
miles
from
here
the
were
led
by
don
quixote
a
heavy
rifle
over
his
shoulder
intended
for
bears
and
wolves
this
day
has
been
as
hot
and
dusty
as
the
first
leading
over
gently
sloping
brown
hills
with
mostly
the
same
vegetation
excepting
the
sabine
pine
which
here
forms
small
groves
or
is
scattered
among
the
blue
oaks
the
trunk
divides
at
a
height
of
fifteen
or
twenty
feet
into
two
or
more
stems
outleaning
or
nearly
upright
with
many
straggling
branches
and
long
gray
needles
casting
but
little
shade
in
general
appearance
this
tree
looks
more
like
a
palm
than
a
pine
the
cones
are
about
six
or
seven
inches
long
about
five
in
diameter
very
heavy
and
last
long
after
they
fall
so
that
the
ground
beneath
the
trees
is
covered
with
them
they
make
fine
resiny
next
to
ears
of
indian
corn
the
most
beautiful
fuel
i
ever
seen
the
nuts
the
don
tells
me
are
gathered
in
large
quantities
by
the
digger
indians
for
food
they
are
about
as
large
and
as
hazelnuts
food
and
fire
fit
for
the
gods
from
the
same
fruit
this
morning
a
few
hours
after
setting
out
with
the
crawling
we
gained
the
summit
of
the
first
bench
on
the
at
pino
blanco
the
sabine
pines
interest
me
greatly
they
are
so
airy
and
strangely
i
was
eager
to
sketch
them
and
was
in
a
fever
of
excitement
without
accomplishing
much
i
managed
to
halt
long
enough
however
to
make
a
tolerably
fair
sketch
of
pino
blanco
peak
from
the
southwest
side
where
there
is
a
small
field
and
vineyard
irrigated
by
a
stream
that
makes
a
pretty
fall
on
its
way
down
a
gorge
by
the
roadside
after
gaining
the
open
summit
of
this
first
bench
feeling
the
natural
exhilaration
due
to
the
slight
elevation
of
a
thousand
feet
or
so
and
the
hopes
excited
concerning
the
outlook
to
be
obtained
a
magnificent
section
of
the
merced
valley
at
what
is
called
horseshoe
bend
came
full
in
sight
a
glorious
wilderness
that
seemed
to
be
calling
with
a
thousand
songful
voices
bold
slopes
feathered
with
pines
and
clumps
of
manzanita
with
sunny
open
spaces
between
them
make
up
most
of
the
foreground
the
middle
and
background
present
fold
beyond
fold
of
finely
modeled
hills
and
ridges
rising
into
masses
in
the
distance
all
covered
with
a
shaggy
growth
of
chaparral
mostly
adenostoma
planted
so
marvelously
close
and
even
that
it
looks
like
soft
rich
plush
without
a
single
tree
or
bare
spot
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
it
extends
a
heaving
swelling
sea
of
green
as
regular
and
continuous
as
that
produced
by
the
heaths
of
scotland
the
sculpture
of
the
landscape
is
as
striking
in
its
main
lines
as
in
its
lavish
richness
of
detail
a
grand
congregation
of
massive
heights
with
the
river
shining
between
each
carved
into
smooth
graceful
folds
without
leaving
a
single
rocky
angle
exposed
as
if
the
delicate
fluting
and
ridging
fashioned
out
of
metamorphic
slates
had
been
carefully
sandpapered
the
whole
landscape
showed
design
like
man
noblest
sculptures
how
wonderful
the
power
of
its
beauty
gazing
i
might
have
left
everything
for
it
glad
endless
work
would
then
be
mine
tracing
the
forces
that
have
brought
forth
its
features
its
rocks
and
plants
and
animals
and
glorious
weather
beauty
beyond
thought
everywhere
beneath
above
made
and
being
made
forever
i
gazed
and
gazed
and
longed
and
admired
until
the
dusty
sheep
and
packs
were
far
out
of
sight
made
hurried
notes
and
a
sketch
though
there
was
no
need
of
either
for
the
colors
and
lines
and
expression
of
this
divine
are
so
burned
into
mind
and
heart
they
surely
can
never
grow

near

the
evening
of
this
charmed
day
is
cool
calm
cloudless
and
full
of
a
kind
of
lightning
i
have
never
seen
before
white
glowing
masses
down
among
the
trees
and
bushes
like
fireflies
in
the
wisconsin
meadows
rather
than
the
wild
fire
the
spreading
hairs
of
the
horses
tails
and
sparks
from
our
blankets
show
how
highly
charged
the
air
is
we
are
now
on
what
may
be
called
the
second
bench
or
plateau
of
the
range
after
making
many
small
ups
and
downs
over
belts
of
with
of
course
corresponding
changes
in
the
vegetation
in
open
spots
many
of
the

are
still
to
be
found
and
some
of
the
mariposa
tulips
and
other
conspicuous
members
of
the
lily
family
but
the
characteristic
blue
oak
of
the
foothills
is
left
below
and
its
place
is
taken
by
a
fine
large
species
with
deeply
lobed
deciduous
leaves
picturesquely
divided
trunk
and
broad
massy
finely
lobed
and
modeled
head
here
also
at
a
height
of
about
hundred
feet
we
come
to
the
edge
of
the
great
coniferous
forest
made
up
mostly
of
yellow
pine
with
just
a
few
sugar
pines
we
are
now
in
the
mountains
and
they
are
in
us
kindling
enthusiasm
making
every
nerve
quiver
filling
every
pore
and
cell
of
us
our
tabernacle
seems
transparent
as
glass
to
the
beauty
about
us
as
if
truly
an
inseparable
part
of
it
thrilling
with
the
air
and
trees
streams
and
rocks
in
the
waves
of
the
sun
a
part
of
all
nature
neither
old
nor
young
sick
nor
well
but
immortal
just
now
i
can
hardly
conceive
of
any
bodily
condition
dependent
on
food
or
breath
any
more
than
the
ground
or
the
sky
how
glorious
a
conversion
so
complete
and
wholesome
it
is
scarce
memory
enough
of
old
bondage
days
left
as
a
standpoint
to
view
it
from
in
this
newness
of
life
we
seem
to
have
been
so
always
through
a
meadow
opening
in
the
pine
woods
i
see
snowy
peaks
about
the
headwaters
of
the
merced
above
yosemite
how
near
they
seem
and
how
clear
their
outlines
on
the
blue
air
or
rather
the
blue
air
for
they
seem
to
be
saturated
with
it
how
consuming
strong
the
invitation
they
extend
shall
i
be
allowed
to
go
to
them
night
and
day
i
pray
that
i
may
but
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
some
one
worthy
will
go
able
for
the
godful
work
yet
as
far
as
i
can
i
must
drift
about
these
mountains
glad
to
be
a
servant
of
servants
in
so
holy
a
wilderness
found
a
lovely
lily
in
a
shady
adenostoma
thicket
near
coulterville
in
company
with
it
is
white
with
a
faint
purplish
tinge
inside
at
the
base
of
the
petals
a
most
impressive
plant
pure
as
a
snow
crystal
one
of
the
plant
saints
that
all
must
love
and
be
made
so
much
the
purer
by
it
every
time
it
is
seen
it
puts
the
roughest
mountaineer
on
his
good
behavior
with
this
plant
the
whole
world
would
seem
rich
though
none
other
existed
it
is
not
easy
to
keep
on
with
the
camp
cloud
while
such
plant
people
are
standing
preaching
by
the
wayside
during
the
afternoon
we
passed
a
fine
meadow
bounded
by
stately
pines
mostly
the
arrowy
yellow
pine
with
here
and
there
a
noble
sugar
pine
its
feathery
arms
outspread
above
the
spires
of
its
companion
species
in
marked
contrast
a
glorious
tree
its
cones
fifteen
to
twenty
inches
long
swinging
like
tassels
at
the
ends
of
the
branches
with
superb
ornamental
effect
saw
some
logs
of
this
species
at
the
greeley
mill
they
are
round
and
regular
as
if
turned
in
a
lathe
excepting
the
butt
cuts
which
have
a
few
buttressing
projections
the
fragrance
of
the
sugary
sap
is
delicious
and
scents
the
mill
and
lumber
yard
how
beautiful
the
ground
beneath
this
pine
thickly
strewn
with
slender
needles
and
grand
cones
and
the
piles
of
and
shells
around
the
instep
of
each
tree
where
the
squirrels
have
been
feasting
they
get
the
seeds
by
cutting
off
the
scales
at
the
base
in
regular
order
following
their
spiral
arrangement
and
the
two
seeds
at
the
base
of
each
scale
a
hundred
or
two
in
a
cone
must
make
a
good
meal
the
yellow
pine
cones
and
those
of
most
other
species
and
genera
are
held
upside
down
on
the
ground
by
the
douglas
squirrel
and
turned
around
gradually
until
stripped
while
he
sits
usually
with
his
back
to
a
tree
probably
for
safety
strange
to
say
he
never
seems
to
get
himself
smeared
with
gum
not
even
his
paws
or
whiskers
and
how
cleanly
and
beautiful
in
color
the
he
makes
we
are
now
approaching
the
region
of
clouds
and
cool
streams
magnificent
white
cumuli
appeared
about
noon
above
the
yosemite
region
floating
fountains
refreshing
the
glorious
wilderness
sky
mountains
in
whose
pearly
hills
and
dales
the
streams
take
their
rise
blessing
with
cooling
shadows
and
rain
no
rock
landscape
is
more
varied
in
sculpture
none
more
delicately
modeled
than
these
landscapes
of
the
sky
domes
and
peaks
rising
swelling
white
as
finest
marble
and
firmly
outlined
a
most
impressive
manifestation
of
world
building
every
however
fleeting
leaves
its
mark
not
only
on
trees
and
flowers
whose
pulses
are
quickened
and
on
the
replenished
streams
and
lakes
but
also
on
the
rocks
are
its
marks
engraved
whether
we
can
see
them
or
not
i
have
been
examining
the
curious
and
influential
shrub
first
noticed
about
horseshoe
bend
it
is
very
abundant
on
the
lower
slopes
of
the
second
plateau
near
coulterville
forming
a
dense
almost
impenetrable
growth
that
looks
dark
in
the
distance
it
belongs
to
the
rose
family
is
about
six
or
eight
feet
high
has
small
white
flowers
in
racemes
eight
to
twelve
inches
long
round
leaves
and
reddish
bark
that
becomes
shreddy
when
old
it
grows
on
slopes
and
like
grass
is
often
swept
away
by
running
fires
but
is
quickly
renewed
from
the
roots
any
trees
that
may
have
established
themselves
in
its
midst
are
at
length
killed
by
these
fires
and
this
no
doubt
is
the
secret
of
the
unbroken
character
of
its
broad
belts
a
few
manzanitas
which
also
rise
again
from
the
root
after
consuming
fires
make
out
to
dwell
with
it
also
a
few
bush
composit脱
baccharis
and
linosyris
and
some
liliaceous
plants
mostly
calochortus
and
brodi脱a
with
deepset
bulbs
safe
from
fire
a
multitude
of
birds
and
wee
sleekit
beasties
find
good
homes
in
its
deepest
thickets
and
the
open
bays
and
lanes
that
fringe
the
margins
of
its
main
belts
offer
shelter
and
food
to
the
deer
when
winter
storms
drive
them
down
from
their
high
mountain
pastures
a
most
admirable
plant
it
is
now
in
bloom
and
i
like
to
wear
its
pretty
fragrant
racemes
in
my
buttonhole
another
charming
shrub
grows
beside
cool
streams
hereabouts
and
much
higher
in
the
yosemite
region
we
found
it
this
evening
in
bloom
a
few
miles
above
greeley
mill
where
we
are
camped
for
the
night
it
is
closely
related
to
the
rhododendrons
is
very
showy
and
fragrant
and
everybody
must
like
it
not
only
for
itself
but
for
the
shady
alders
and
willows
ferny
meadows
and
living
water
associated
with
it
another
conifer
was
met
incense
cedar
a
large
tree
with
warm
foliage
in
flat
plumes
like
those
of
arborvit脱
bark
and
as
the
boles
of
the
old
trees
are
without
limbs
they
make
striking
pillars
in
the
woods
where
the
sun
chances
to
shine
on
them
a
worthy
companion
of
the
kingly
sugar
and
yellow
pines
i
feel
strangely
attracted
to
this
tree
the
brown
wood
as
well
as
the
small
leaves
is
fragrant
and
the
flat
overlapping
plumes
make
fine
beds
and
must
shed
the
rain
well
it
would
be
delightful
to
be
beneath
one
of
these
noble
hospitable
inviting
old
trees
its
broad
sheltering
arms
bent
down
like
a
tent
incense
rising
from
the
fire
made
from
its
dry
fallen
branches
and
a
hearty
wind
chanting
overhead
but
the
weather
is
calm
and
our
camp
is
only
a
sheep
camp
we
are
near
the
north
fork
of
the
merced
the
night
wind
is
telling
the
wonders
of
the
upper
mountains
their
snow
fountains
and
gardens
forests
and
groves
even
their
topography
is
in
its
tones
and
the
stars
the
everlasting
sky
lilies
how
bright
they
are
now
that
we
have
climbed
above
the
lowland
dust
the
horizon
is
bounded
and
adorned
by
a
spiry
wall
of
pines
every
tree
harmoniously
related
to
every
other
definite
symbols
divine
hieroglyphics
written
with
sunbeams
would
i
could
understand
them
the
stream
flowing
past
the
camp
through
ferns
and
lilies
and
alders
makes
sweet
music
to
the
ear
but
the
pines
marshaled
around
the
edge
of
the
sky
make
a
yet
sweeter
music
to
the
eye
divine
beauty
all
here
i
could
stay
tethered
forever
with
just
bread
and
water
nor
would
i
be
lonely
loved
friends
and
neighbors
as
love
for
everything
increased
would
seem
all
the
nearer
however
many
the
miles
and
mountains
between
us
the
sheep
were
sick
last
night
and
many
of
them
are
still
far
from
well
hardly
able
to
leave
camp
coughing
groaning
looking
wretched
and
pitiful
all
from
eating
the
leaves
of
the
blessed
azalea
so
at
least
say
the
shepherd
and
the
don
having
had
but
little
grass
since
they
left
the
plains
they
are
starving
and
so
eat
anything
green
they
can
get
sheep
men
call
azalea
and
wonder
what
the
creator
was
thinking
about
when
he
made
it
so
desperately
does
sheep
business
blind
and
degrade
though
supposed
to
have
a
refining
influence
in
the
good
old
days
we
read
of
the
california
sheep
owner
is
in
haste
to
get
rich
and
often
does
now
that
pasturage
costs
nothing
while
the
climate
is
so
favorable
that
no
winter
food
supply
or
barns
are
required
therefore
large
flocks
may
be
kept
at
slight
expense
and
large
profits
realized
the
money
invested
doubling
it
is
claimed
every
other
year
this
quickly
acquired
wealth
usually
creates
desire
for
more
then
indeed
the
wool
is
drawn
close
down
over
the
poor
fellow
eyes
dimming
or
shutting
out
almost
everything
worth
seeing
as
for
the
shepherd
his
case
is
still
worse
especially
in
winter
when
he
lives
alone
in
a
cabin
for
though
stimulated
at
times
by
hopes
of
one
day
owning
a
flock
and
getting
rich
like
his
boss
he
at
the
same
time
is
likely
to
be
degraded
by
the
life
he
leads
and
seldom
reaches
the
dignity
or
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
ownership
the
degradation
in
his
case
has
for
cause
one
not
far
to
seek
he
is
solitary
most
of
the
year
and
solitude
to
most
people
seems
hard
to
bear
he
seldom
has
much
good
mental
work
or
recreation
in
the
way
of
books
coming
into
his
dingy
at
night
stupidly
weary
he
finds
nothing
to
balance
and
level
his
life
with
the
universe
no
after
his
dull
drag
all
day
after
the
sheep
he
must
get
his
supper
he
is
likely
to
slight
this
task
and
try
to
satisfy
his
hunger
with
whatever
comes
handy
perhaps
no
bread
is
baked
then
he
just
makes
a
few
grimy
flapjacks
in
his
unwashed
boils
a
handful
of
tea
and
perhaps
fries
a
few
strips
of
rusty
bacon
usually
there
are
dried
peaches
or
apples
in
the
cabin
but
he
hates
to
be
bothered
with
the
cooking
of
them
just
swallows
the
bacon
and
flapjacks
and
depends
on
the
genial
stupefaction
of
tobacco
for
the
rest
then
to
bed
often
without
removing
the
clothing
worn
during
the
day
of
course
his
health
suffers
reacting
on
his
mind
and
seeing
nobody
for
weeks
or
months
he
finally
becomes
or
wholly
so
the
shepherd
in
scotland
seldom
thinks
of
being
anything
but
a
shepherd
he
has
probably
descended
from
a
race
of
shepherds
and
inherited
a
love
and
aptitude
for
the
business
almost
as
marked
as
that
of
his
collie
he
has
but
a
small
flock
to
look
after
sees
his
family
and
neighbors
has
time
for
reading
in
fine
weather
and
often
carries
books
to
the
fields
with

a

embowered
with

unlike
anything
i
have
seen
in

in

a

honeycombed
with

on

many

none
like

i
have
learned

the

blends
harmoniously
with
its

and
many
a
charming
flower
leans
confidingly
upon
it

protection
and
shade

have
oftentimes
found
the
curious
twining

climbing

no

rather
congenial

through

though
sternly
practical
like
most
pioneers
old
david
seems
to
have
been
uncommonly
fond
of
scenery
delaney
who
knew
him
well
tells
me
that
he
dearly
loved
to
climb
to
the
summit
of
a
commanding
ridge
to
gaze
abroad
over
the
forest
to
the
peaks
and
sources
of
the
rivers
and
over
the
foreground
valleys
and
gulches
to
note
where
miners
were
at
work
or
claims
were
abandoned
judging
by
smoke
from
cabins
and
the
sounds
of
axes
etc
and
when
a
was
heard
to
guess
who
was
the
hunter
whether
indian
or
some
poacher
on
his
wide
domain
his
dog
sandy
accompanied
him
everywhere
and
well
the
little
hairy
mountaineer
knew
and
loved
his
master
and
his
master
aims
in
he
had
but
little
to
do
trotting
behind
his
master
as
he
slowly
made
his
way
through
the
wood
careful
not
to
step
heavily
on
dry
twigs
scanning
open
spots
in
the
chaparral
where
the
game
loves
to
feed
in
the
early
morning
and
towards
sunset
peering
cautiously
over
ridges
as
new
outlooks
were
reached
and
along
the
meadowy
borders
of
streams
but
when
bears
were
hunted
little
sandy
became
more
important
and
it
was
as
a
that
brown
became
famous
his
hunting
method
as
described
by
delaney
who
had
passed
many
a
night
with
him
in
his
lonely
cabin
and
learned
his
stories
was
simply
to
go
slowly
and
silently
through
the
best
bear
pastures
with
his
dog
and
rifle
and
a
few
pounds
of
flour
until
he
found
a
fresh
track
and
then
follow
it
to
the
death
paying
no
heed
to
the
time
required
wherever
the
bear
went
he
followed
led
by
little
sandy
who
had
a
keen
nose
and
never
lost
the
track
however
rocky
the
ground
when
high
open
points
were
reached
the
likeliest
places
were
carefully
scanned
the
time
of
year
enabled
the
hunter
to
determine
approximately
where
the
bear
would
be
found
in
the
spring
and
early
summer
on
open
spots
about
the
banks
of
streams
and
springy
places
eating
grass
and
clover
and
lupines
or
in
dry
meadows
feasting
on
strawberries
toward
the
end
of
summer
on
dry
ridges
feasting
on
manzanita
berries
sitting
on
his
haunches
pulling
down
the
laden
branches
with
his
paws
and
pressing
them
together
so
as
to
get
good
compact
mouthfuls
however
much
mixed
with
twigs
and
leaves
in
the
indian
summer
beneath
the
pines
chewing
the
cones
cut
off
by
the
squirrels
or
occasionally
climbing
a
tree
to
gnaw
and
break
off
the
fruitful
branches
in
late
autumn
when
acorns
are
ripe
favorite
are
groves
of
the
california
oak
in
ca単on
flats
always
the
cunning
hunter
knew
where
to
look
and
seldom
came
upon
bruin
unawares
when
the
hot
scent
showed
the
dangerous
game
was
nigh
a
long
halt
was
made
and
the
intricacies
of
the
topography
and
vegetation
leisurely
scanned
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
shaggy
wanderer
or
to
at
least
determine
where
he
was
most
likely
to
be
whenever
said
the
hunter
i
saw
a
bear
before
it
saw
me
i
had
no
trouble
in
killing
it
i
just
studied
the
lay
of
the
land
and
got
to
leeward
of
it
no
matter
how
far
around
i
had
to
go
and
then
worked
up
to
within
a
few
hundred
yards
or
so
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
that
i
could
easily
climb
but
too
small
for
the
bear
to
climb
then
i
looked
well
to
the
condition
of
my
rifle
took
off
my
boots
so
as
to
climb
well
if
necessary
and
waited
until
the
bear
turned
its
side
in
clear
view
when
i
could
make
a
sure
or
at
least
a
good
shot
in
case
it
showed
fight
i
climbed
out
of
reach
but
bears
are
slow
and
awkward
with
their
eyes
and
being
to
leeward
of
them
they
could
not
scent
me
and
i
often
got
in
a
second
shot
before
they
noticed
the
smoke
usually
however
they
run
when
wounded
and
hide
in
the
brush
i
let
them
run
a
good
safe
time
before
i
ventured
to
follow
them
and
sandy
was
pretty
sure
to
find
them
dead
if
not
he
barked
and
drew
their
attention
and
occasionally
rushed
in
for
a
distracting
bite
so
that
i
was
able
to
get
to
a
safe
distance
for
a
final
shot
oh
yes
is
safe
enough
when
followed
in
a
safe
way
though
like
every
other
business
it
has
its
accidents
and
little
doggie
and
i
have
had
some
close
calls
bears
like
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
men
as
a
general
thing
but
if
an
old
lean
hungry
mother
with
cubs
met
a
man
on
her
own
ground
she
would
in
my
opinion
try
to
catch
and
eat
him
this
would
be
only
fair
play
anyhow
for
we
eat
them
but
nobody
hereabout
has
been
used
for
bear
grub
that
i
know
of
brown
had
left
his
mountain
home
ere
we
arrived
but
a
considerable
number
of
digger
indians
still
linger
in
their
huts
on
the
edge
of
the
flat
they
were
attracted
in
the
first
place
by
the
white
hunter
whom
they
had
learned
to
respect
and
to
whom
they
looked
for
guidance
and
protection
against
their
enemies
the
pah
utes
who
sometimes
made
raids
across
from
the
east
side
of
the
range
to
plunder
the
stores
of
the
comparatively
feeble
diggers
and
steal
their
wives

from

i
seen
clouds
so
substantial
looking
in
form
and
texture
nearly
every
day
toward
noon
they
rise
with
visible
swelling
motion
as
if
new
worlds
were
being
created
and
how
fondly
they
brood
and
hover
over
the
gardens
and
forests
with
their
cooling
shadows
and
showers
keeping
every
petal
and
leaf
in
glad
health
and
heart
one
may
fancy
the
clouds
themselves
are
plants
springing
up
in
the
at
the
call
of
the
sun
growing
in
beauty

they
reach

the

in
its

are
about
seven
to
eight
feet

as
wide

wider

the

without

on

serrated

some
of

have
hardly
any

dividing

these

again

in

a

another

in
which
one
seems
to
be
dissolved
and
absorbed
and
sent
pulsing

and
we
take
no

to

yonder

another

how
sharply
the
yellow

and

of

on
its
smooth

hark
the
grand

booming
rolling
from

followed
by
the
faithful

a

many
herbaceous
plants
come

far
up

from

are

their

saw

cheilanthes

gymnogramme
woodwardia
aspidium
woodsia
along
the

banks
and
the
common
on
sandy
flats
this
last
however
common
is
here
making
shows
of
strong
exuberant
abounding
beauty
to
set
the
botanist
wild
with
admiration
i
measured
some
scarce
full
grown
that
are
more
than
seven
feet
high
though
the
commonest
and
most
widely
distributed
of
all
the
ferns
i
might
almost
say
that
i
never
saw
it
before
the
fronds
held
high
on
smooth
stout
stalks
growing
close
together
overleaning
and
overlapping
make
a
complete
ceiling
beneath
which
one
may
walk
erect
over
several
acres
without
being
seen
as
if
beneath
a
roof
and
how
soft
and
lovely
the
light
streaming
through
this
living
ceiling
revealing
the
arching
branching
ribs
and
veins
of
the
fronds
as
the
framework
of
countless
panes
of
pale
green
and
yellow
nicely
fitted
together
a
fairyland
created
out
of
the
commonest
the
smaller
animals
wander
about
as
if
in
a
tropical
forest
i
saw
the
entire
flock
of
sheep
vanish
at
one
side
of
a
patch
and
reappear
a
hundred
yards
farther
on
at
the
other
their
progress
betrayed
only
by
the
jerking
and
trembling
of
the
fronds
and
strange
to
say
very
few
of
the
stout
woody
stalks
were
broken
i
sat
a
long
time
beneath
the
tallest
fronds
and
never
enjoyed
anything
in
the
way
of
a
bower
of
wild
leaves
more
strangely
impressive
only
spread
a
fern
frond
over
a
head
and
worldly
cares
are
cast
out
and
freedom
and
beauty
and
peace
come
in
the
waving
of
a
pine
tree
on
the
top
of
a
mountain
a
magic
wand
in
nature
hand
every
devout
mountaineer
knows
its
power
but
the
marvelous
beauty
value
of
what
the
scotch
call
a
breckan
in
a
still
dell
what
poet
has
sung
this
it
would
seem
impossible
that
any
one
however
incrusted
with
care
could
escape
the
godful
influence
of
these
sacred
fern
forests
yet
this
very
day
i
saw
a
shepherd
pass
through
one
of
the
finest
of
them
without
betraying
more
feeling
than
his
sheep
what
do
you
think
of
these
grand
ferns
i
asked
oh
they
only
d
d
big
brakes
he
replied
lizards
of
every
temper
style
and
color
dwell
here
seemingly
as
happy
and
companionable
as
the
birds
and
squirrels
lowly
gentle
fellow
mortals
enjoying
god
sunshine
and
doing
the
best
they
can
in
getting
a
living
i
like
to
watch
them
at
their
work
and
play
they
bear
acquaintance
well
and
one
likes
them
the
better
the
longer
one
looks
into
their
beautiful
innocent
eyes
they
are
easily
tamed
and
one
soon
learns
to
love
them
as
they
dart
about
on
the
hot
rocks
swift
as
the
eye
can
hardly
follow
them
but
they
never
make
runs
usually
only
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
then
a
sudden
stop
and
as
sudden
a
start
again
going
all
their
journeys
by
quick
jerking
impulses
these
many
stops
i
find
are
necessary
as
rests
for
they
are
and
when
pursued
steadily
are
soon
out
of
breath
pant
pitifully
and
are
easily
caught
their
bodies
are
more
than
half
tail
but
these
tails
are
well
managed
never
heavily
dragged
nor
curved
up
as
if
hard
to
carry
on
the
contrary
they
seem
to
follow
the
body
lightly
of
their
own
will
some
are
colored
like
the
sky
bright
as
bluebirds
others
gray
like
the
lichened
rocks
on
which
they
hunt
and
bask
even
the
horned
toad
of
the
plains
is
a
mild
harmless
creature
and
so
are
the
species
which
glide
in
curves
with
true
snake
motion
while
their
small
undeveloped
limbs
drag
as
useless
appendages
one
specimen
fourteen
inches
long
which
i
observed
closely
made
no
use
whatever
of
its
tender
sprouting
limbs
but
glided
with
all
the
soft
sly
ease
and
grace
of
a
snake
here
comes
a
little
gray
dusty
fellow
who
seems
to
know
and
trust
me
running
about
my
feet
and
looking
up
cunningly
into
my
face
carlo
is
watching
makes
a
quick
pounce
on
him
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
suppose
but
liz
has
shot
away
from
his
paws
like
an
arrow
and
is
safe
in
the
recesses
of
a
clump
of
chaparral
gentle
saurians
dragons
descendants
of
an
ancient
and
mighty
race
heaven
bless
you
all
and
make
your
virtues
known
for
few
of
us
know
as
yet
that
scales
may
cover
fellow
creatures
as
gentle
and
lovable
as
feathers
or
hair
or
cloth
mastodons
and
elephants
used
to
live
here
no
great
geological
time
ago
as
shown
by
their
bones
often
discovered
by
miners
in
washing
and
bears
of
at
least
two
species
are
here
now
besides
the
california
lion
or
panther
and
wild
cats
wolves
foxes
snakes
scorpions
wasps
tarantulas
but
one
is
almost
tempted
at
times
to
regard
a
small
savage
black
ant
as
the
master
existence
of
this
vast
mountain
world
these
fearless
restless
wandering
imps
though
only
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
long
are
fonder
of
fighting
and
biting
than
any
beast
i
know
they
attack
every
living
thing
around
their
homes
often
without
cause
as
far
as
i
can
see
their
bodies
are
mostly
jaws
curved
like
and
to
get
work
for
these
weapons
seems
to
be
their
chief
aim
and
pleasure
most
of
their
colonies
are
established
in
living
oaks
somewhat
decayed
or
hollowed
in
which
they
can
conveniently
build
their
cells
these
are
chosen
probably
because
of
their
strength
as
opposed
to
the
attacks
of
animals
and
storms
they
work
both
day
and
night
creep
into
dark
caves
climb
the
highest
trees
wander
and
hunt
through
cool
ravines
as
well
as
on
hot
unshaded
ridges
and
extend
their
highways
and
byways
over
everything
but
water
and
sky
from
the
foothills
to
a
mile
above
the
level
of
the
sea
nothing
can
stir
without
their
knowledge
and
alarms
are
spread
in
an
incredibly
short
time
without
any
howl
or
cry
that
we
can
hear
i
ca
understand
the
need
of
their
ferocious
courage
there
seems
to
be
no
common
sense
in
it
sometimes
no
doubt
they
fight
in
defense
of
their
homes
but
they
fight
anywhere
and
always
wherever
they
can
find
anything
to
bite
as
soon
as
a
vulnerable
spot
is
discovered
on
man
or
beast
they
stand
on
their
heads
and
sink
their
jaws
and
though
torn
limb
from
limb
they
will
yet
hold
on
and
die
biting
deeper
when
i
contemplate
this
fierce
creature
so
widely
distributed
and
strongly
intrenched
i
see
that
much
remains
to
be
done
ere
the
world
is
brought
under
the
rule
of
universal
peace
and
love
on
my
way
to
camp
a
few
minutes
ago
i
passed
a
dead
pine
nearly
ten
feet
in
diameter
it
has
been
enveloped
in
fire
from
top
to
bottom
so
that
now
it
looks
like
a
grand
black
pillar
set
up
as
a
monument
in
this
noble
shaft
a
colony
of
large
ants
have
established
themselves
laboriously
cutting
tunnels
and
cells
through
the
wood
whether
sound
or
decayed
the
entire
trunk
seems
to
have
been
honeycombed
judging
by
the
size
of
the
talus
of
gnawed
chips
like
sawdust
piled
up
around
its
base
they
are
more
intelligent
looking
than
their
small
belligerent
brethren
and
have
better
manners
though
quick
to
fight
when
required
their
towns
are
carved
in
fallen
trunks
as
well
as
in
those
left
standing
but
never
in
sound
living
trees
or
in
the
ground
when
you
happen
to
sit
down
to
rest
or
take
notes
near
a
colony
some
wandering
hunter
is
sure
to
find
you
and
come
cautiously
forward
to
discover
the
nature
of
the
intruder
and
what
ought
to
be
done
if
you
are
not
too
near
the
town
and
keep
perfectly
still
he
may
run
across
your
feet
a
few
times
over
your
legs
and
hands
and
face
up
your
trousers
as
if
taking
your
measure
and
getting
comprehensive
views
then
go
in
peace
without
raising
an
alarm
if
however
a
tempting
spot
is
offered
or
some
suspicious
movement
excites
him
a
bite
follows
and
such
a
bite
i
fancy
that
a
bear
or
wolf
bite
is
not
to
be
compared
with
it
a
quick
electric
flame
of
pain
flashes
along
the
outraged
nerves
and
you
discover
for
the
first
time
how
great
is
the
capacity
for
sensation
you
are
possessed
of
a
shriek
a
grab
for
the
animal
and
a
bewildered
stare
follow
this
bite
of
bites
as
one
comes
back
to
consciousness
from
sudden
eclipse
fortunately
if
careful
one
need
not
be
bitten
oftener
than
once
or
twice
in
a
lifetime
this
wonderful
electric
species
is
about
three
fourths
of
an
inch
long
bears
are
fond
of
them
and
tear
and
gnaw
their
to
pieces
and
roughly
devour
the
eggs
larv脱
parent
ants
and
the
rotten
or
sound
wood
of
the
cells
all
in
one
spicy
acid
hash
the
digger
indians
also
are
fond
of
the
larv脱
and
even
of
the
perfect
ants
so
i
have
been
told
by
old
mountaineers
they
bite
off
and
reject
the
head
and
eat
the
tickly
acid
body
with
keen
relish
thus
are
the
poor
biters
bitten
like
every
other
biter
big
or
little
in
the
world
great
family
there
is
also
a
fine
active
red
species
intermediate
in
size
between
the
above
they
dwell
in
the
ground
and
build
large
piles
of
seed
husks
leaves
straw
over
their
nests
their
food
seems
to
be
mostly
insects
and
plant
leaves
seeds
and
sap
how
many
mouths
nature
has
to
fill
how
many
neighbors
we
have
how
little
we
know
about
them
and
how
seldom
we
get
in
each
other
way
then
to
think
of
the
infinite
numbers
of
smaller
fellow
mortals
invisibly
small
compared
with
which
the
smallest
ants
are
as
mastodons
the
below
the
falls
and
cascades
hereabouts
formed
by
the
heavy
currents
are
kept
nicely
clean
and
clear
of
detritus
the
heavier
parts
of
the
material
swept
over
the
falls
are
heaped
up
a
short
distance
in
front
of
the
basins
in
the
form
of
a
dam
thus
tending
together
with
erosion
to
increase
their
size
sudden
changes
however
are
effected
during
the
spring
floods
when
the
snow
is
melting
and
the
upper
tributaries
are
roaring
loud
from
bank
to
brae
then
boulders
that
have
fallen
into
the
channels
and
which
the
ordinary
summer
and
winter
currents
were
unable
to
move
are
suddenly
swept
forward
as
by
a
mighty
besom
hurled
over
the
falls
into
these
pools
and
piled
up
in
a
new
dam
together
with
part
of
the
old
one
while
some
of
the
smaller
boulders
are
carried
further
down
stream
and
variously
lodged
according
to
size
and
shape
all
seeking
rest
where
the
force
of
the
current
is
less
than
the
resistance
they
are
able
to
offer
but
the
greatest
changes
made
in
these
relations
of
fall
pool
and
dam
are
caused
not
by
the
ordinary
spring
floods
but
by
extraordinary
ones
that
occur
at
irregular
intervals
the
testimony
of
trees
growing
on
flood
boulder
deposits
shows
that
a
century
or
more
has
passed
since
the
last
master
flood
came
to
awaken
everything
movable
to
go
swirling
and
dancing
on
wonderful
journeys
these
floods
may
occur
during
the
summer
when
heavy
called
fall
on
wide
steeply
inclined
stream
basins
furrowed
by
converging
channels
which
suddenly
gather
the
waters
together
into
the
main
trunk
in
booming
torrents
of
enormous
transporting
power
though
short
lived
one
of
these
ancient
flood
boulders
stands
firm
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
channel
just
below
the
lower
edge
of
the
pool
dam
at
the
foot
of
the
fall
nearest
our
camp
it
is
a
nearly
cubical
mass
of
granite
about
eight
feet
high
plushed
with
mosses
over
the
top
and
down
the
sides
to
ordinary
mark
when
i
climbed
on
top
of
it
and
lay
down
to
rest
it
seemed
the
most
romantic
spot
i
had
yet
found
the
one
big
stone
with
its
mossy
level
top
and
smooth
sides
standing
square
and
firm
and
solitary
like
an
altar
the
fall
in
front
of
it
bathing
it
lightly
with
the
finest
of
the
spray
just
enough
to
keep
its
moss
cover
fresh
the
clear
green
pool
beneath
with
its
and
its
half
circle
of
lilies
leaning
forward
like
a
band
of
admirers
and
flowering
dogwood
and
alder
trees
leaning
over
all
in
arches
how
soothingly
restfully
cool
it
is
beneath
that
leafy
translucent
ceiling
and
how
delightful
the
water
music
the
deep
bass
tones
of
the
fall
the
clashing
ringing
spray
and
infinite
variety
of
small
low
tones
of
the
current
gliding
past
the
side
of
the
and
glinting
against
a
thousand
smaller
stones
down
the
ferny
channel
all
this
shut
in
every
one
of
these
influences
acting
at
short
range
as
if
in
a
quiet
room
the
place
seemed
holy
where
one
might
hope
to
see
god
after
dark
when
the
camp
was
at
rest
i
groped
my
way
back
to
the
altar
boulder
and
passed
the
night
on
it
above
the
water
beneath
the
leaves
and
stars
everything
still
more
impressive
than
by
day
the
fall
seen
dimly
white
singing
nature
old
love
song
with
solemn
enthusiasm
while
the
stars
peering
through
the
seemed
to
join
in
the
white
water
song
precious
night
precious
day
to
abide
in
me
forever
thanks
be
to
god
for
this
immortal
gift
another
reviving
morning
down
the
long
the
sunbeams
pour
gilding
the
awakening
pines
cheering
every
needle
filling
every
living
thing
with
joy
robins
are
singing
in
the
alder
and
maple
groves
the
same
old
song
that
has
cheered
and
sweetened
countless
seasons
over
almost
all
of
our
blessed
continent
in
this
mountain
hollow
they
seem
as
much
at
home
as
in
farmers
orchards
oriole
and
the
louisiana
tanager
are
here
also
with
many
warblers
and
other
little
mountain
troubadours
most
of
them
now
busy
about
their
nests
discovered
another
magnificent
specimen
of
the
goldcup
oak
six
feet
in
diameter
a
douglas
spruce
seven
feet
and
a
twining
lily
with
stem
eight
feet
long
and
sixty
flowers
illustration
sugar
pine
sugar
pine
cones
are
cylindrical
slightly
tapered
at
the
end
and
rounded
at
the
base
found
one
nearly
inches
long
and
six
in
diameter
the
scales
being
open
another
specimen
nineteen
inches
long
the
average
length
of
cones
on
trees
favorably
situated
is
nearly
eighteen
inches
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
belt
at
a
height
of
about
hundred
feet
above
the
sea
they
are
smaller
say
a
foot
to
fifteen
inches
long
and
at
a
height
of
seven
thousand
feet
or
more
near
the
upper
limits
of
its
growth
in
the
yosemite
region
they
are
about
the
same
size
this
noble
tree
is
an
inexhaustible
study
and
source
of
pleasure
i
never
weary
of
gazing
at
its
grand
tassel
cones
its
perfectly
round
bole
one
hundred
feet
or
more
without
a
limb
the
fine
purplish
color
of
its
bark
and
its
magnificent
outsweeping
feathery
arms
forming
a
crown
always
bold
and
striking
and
exhilarating
in
habit
and
general
port
it
looks
somewhat
like
a
palm
but
no
palm
that
i
have
yet
seen
displays
such
majesty
of
form
and
behavior
either
when
poised
silent
and
thoughtful
in
sunshine
or
waving
in
storm
winds
with
every
needle
quivering
when
young
it
is
very
straight
and
regular
in
form
like
most
other
conifers
but
at
the
age
of
fifty
to
one
hundred
years
it
begins
to
acquire
individuality
so
that
no
two
are
alike
in
their
prime
or
old
age
every
tree
calls
for
special
admiration
i
have
been
making
many
sketches
and
regret
that
i
can
not
draw
every
needle
it
is
said
to
reach
a
height
of
three
hundred
feet
though
the
tallest
i
have
measured
falls
short
of
this
stature
sixty
feet
or
more
the
diameter
of
the
largest
near
the
ground
is
about
ten
feet
though
i
heard
of
some
twelve
feet
thick
or
even
fifteen
the
diameter
is
held
to
a
great
height
the
taper
being
almost
imperceptibly
gradual
its
companion
the
yellow
pine
is
almost
as
large
the
long
silvery
foliage
of
the
younger
specimens
forms
magnificent
cylindrical
brushes
on
the
top
shoots
and
the
ends
of
the
upturned
branches
and
when
the
wind
sways
the
needles
all
one
way
at
a
certain
angle
every
tree
becomes
a
tower
of
white
quivering
well
may
this
shining
species
be
called
the
silver
pine
the
needles
are
sometimes
more
than
a
foot
long
almost
as
long
as
those
of
the
pine
of
florida
but
though
in
size
the
yellow
pine
almost
equals
the
sugar
pine
and
in
rugged
enduring
strength
seems
to
surpass
it
it
is
far
less
marked
in
general
habit
and
expression
with
its
regular
conventional
spire
and
its
comparatively
small
cones
clustered
stiffly
among
the
needles
were
there
no
sugar
pine
then
would
this
be
the
king
of
the
world
eighty
or
ninety
species
the
brightest
of
the
bright
waving
worshiping
multitude
were
they
mere
mechanical
sculptures
what
noble
objects
they
would
still
be
how
much
more
throbbing
thrilling
overflowing
full
of
life
in
every
fiber
and
cell
grand
glowing
the
very
gods
of
the
plant
kingdom
living
their
sublime
century
lives
in
sight
of
heaven
watched
and
loved
and
admired
from
generation
to
generation
and
how
many
other
radiant
resiny
sun
trees
are
here
and
higher
up
libocedrus
douglas
spruce
silver
fir
sequoia
how
rich
our
inheritance
in
these
blessed
mountains
the
tree
pastures
into
which
our
eyes
are
turned
now
comes
sundown
the
west
is
all
a
glory
of
color
transfiguring
everything
far
up
the
pilot
peak
ridge
the
radiant
host
of
trees
stand
hushed
and
thoughtful
receiving
the
sun
as
solemn
and
impressive
a
as
if
sun
and
trees
were
to
meet
no
more
the
daylight
fades
the
color
spell
is
broken
and
the
forest
breathes
free
in
the
night
breeze
beneath
the
stars
one
of
the
indians
from
brown
flat
got
right
into
the
middle
of
the
camp
this
morning
unobserved
i
was
seated
on
a
stone
looking
over
my
notes
and
sketches
and
happening
to
look
up
was
startled
to
see
him
standing
grim
and
silent
within
a
few
steps
of
me
as
motionless
and
as
an
old
that
had
stood
there
for
centuries
all
indians
seem
to
have
learned
this
wonderful
way
of
walking
unseen
making
themselves
invisible
like
certain
spiders
i
have
been
observing
here
which
in
case
of
alarm
caused
for
example
by
a
bird
alighting
on
the
bush
their
webs
are
spread
upon
immediately
bounce
themselves
up
and
down
on
their
elastic
threads
so
rapidly
that
only
a
blur
is
visible
the
wild
indian
power
of
escaping
observation
even
where
there
is
little
or
no
cover
to
hide
in
was
probably
slowly
acquired
in
hard
hunting
and
fighting
lessons
while
trying
to
approach
game
take
enemies
by
surprise
or
get
safely
away
when
compelled
to
retreat
and
this
experience
transmitted
through
many
generations
seems
at
length
to
have
become
what
is
vaguely
called
instinct
how
smooth
and
changeless
seems
the
surface
of
the
mountains
about
us
scarce
a
track
is
to
be
found
beyond
the
range
of
the
sheep
except
on
small
open
spots
on
the
sides
of
the
streams
or
where
the
forest
carpets
are
thin
or
wanting
on
the
smoothest
of
these
open
strips
and
patches
deer
tracks
may
be
seen
and
the
great
suggestive
footprints
of
bears
which
with
those
of
the
many
small
animals
are
scarce
enough
to
answer
as
a
kind
of
light
ornamental
stitching
or
embroidery
along
the
main
ridges
and
larger
branches
of
the
river
indian
trails
may
be
traced
but
they
are
not
nearly
as
distinct
as
one
would
expect
to
find
them
how
many
centuries
indians
have
roamed
these
woods
nobody
knows
probably
a
great
many
extending
far
beyond
the
time
that
columbus
touched
our
shores
and
it
seems
strange
that
heavier
marks
have
not
been
made
indians
walk
softly
and
hurt
the
landscape
hardly
more
than
the
birds
and
squirrels
and
their
brush
and
bark
huts
last
hardly
longer
than
those
of
wood
rats
while
their
more
enduring
monuments
excepting
those
wrought
on
the
forests
by
the
fires
they
made
to
improve
their
hunting
grounds
vanish
in
a
few
centuries
how
different
are
most
of
those
of
the
white
man
especially
on
the
lower
gold
region
roads
blasted
in
the
solid
rock
wild
streams
dammed
and
tamed
and
turned
out
of
their
channels
and
led
along
the
sides
of
ca単ons
and
valleys
to
work
in
mines
like
slaves
crossing
from
ridge
to
ridge
high
in
the
air
on
long
straddling
trestles
as
if
flowing
on
stilts
or
down
and
up
across
valleys
and
hills
imprisoned
in
iron
pipes
to
strike
and
wash
away
hills
and
miles
of
the
skin
of
the
mountain
face
riddling
stripping
every
gold
gully
and
flat
these
are
the
white
man
marks
made
in
a
few
feverish
years
to
say
nothing
of
mills
fields
villages
scattered
hundreds
of
miles
along
the
flank
of
the
range
long
will
it
be
ere
these
marks
are
effaced
though
nature
is
doing
what
she
can
replanting
gardening
sweeping
away
old
dams
and
flumes
leveling
gravel
and
boulder
piles
patiently
trying
to
heal
every
raw
scar
the
main
gold
storm
is
over
calm
enough
are
the
gray
old
miners
scratching
a
bare
living
in
waste
diggings
here
and
there
thundering
underground
blasting
is
still
going
on
to
feed
the
pounding
quartz
mills
but
their
influence
on
the
landscape
is
light
as
compared
with
that
of
the
storms
waged
a
few
years
ago
fortunately
for
sierra
scenery
the
slates
are
mostly
restricted
to
the
foothills
the
region
about
our
camp
is
still
wild
and
higher
lies
the
snow
about
as
trackless
as
the
sky
only
a
few
hills
and
domes
of
cloudland
were
built
yesterday
and
none
at
all
the
light
is
peculiarly
white
and
thin
though
pleasantly
warm
the
serenity
of
this
mountain
weather
in
the
spring
just
when
nature
pulses
are
beating
highest
is
one
of
its
greatest
charms
there
is
only
a
moderate
breeze
from
the
summits
of
the
range
at
night
and
a
slight
breathing
from
the
sea
and
the
lowland
hills
and
plains
during
the
day
or
stillness
so
complete
no
leaf
stirs
the
trees
hereabouts
have
but
little
wind
history
to
tell
sheep
like
people
are
ungovernable
when
hungry
excepting
my
guarded
lily
gardens
almost
every
leaf
that
these
hoofed
locusts
can
reach
within
a
radius
of
a
mile
or
two
from
camp
has
been
devoured
even
the
bushes
are
stripped
bare
and
in
spite
of
dogs
and
shepherds
the
sheep
scatter
to
all
points
of
the
compass
and
vanish
in
dust
i
fear
some
are
lost
for
one
of
the
sixteen
black
ones
is
missing
counted
the
wool
bundles
this
morning
as
they
bounced
through
the
narrow
corral
gate
about
three
hundred
are
missing
and
as
the
shepherd
could
not
go
to
seek
them
i
had
to
go
i
tied
a
crust
of
bread
to
my
belt
and
with
carlo
set
out
for
the
upper
slopes
of
the
pilot
peak
ridge
and
had
a
good
day
notwithstanding
the
care
of
seeking
the
silly
runaways
i
went
out
for
wool
and
did
not
come
back
shorn
a
peculiar
light
circled
around
the
horizon
white
and
thin
like
that
often
seen
over
the
auroral
corona
blending
into
the
blue
of
the
upper
sky
the
only
clouds
were
a
few
faint
flossy
pencilings
like
combed
silk
i
pushed
direct
to
the
boundary
of
the
usual
range
of
the
flock
and
around
it
until
i
found
the
outgoing
trail
of
the
wanderers
it
led
far
up
the
ridge
into
an
open
place
surrounded
by
a
growth
of
ceanothus
chaparral
carlo
knew
what
i
was
about
and
eagerly
followed
the
scent
until
we
came
up
to
them
huddled
in
a
timid
silent
bunch
they
had
evidently
been
here
all
night
and
all
the
forenoon
afraid
to
go
out
to
feed
having
escaped
restraint
they
were
like
some
people
we
know
of
afraid
of
their
freedom
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
and
seemed
glad
to
get
back
into
the
old
familiar
bondage
another
inspiring
morning
nothing
better
in
any
world
can
be
conceived
no
description
of
heaven
that
i
have
ever
heard
or
read
of
seems
half
so
fine
at
noon
the
clouds
occupied
about
of
the
sky
white
filmy
touches
drawn
delicately
on
the
azure
the
high
ridges
and
hilltops
beyond
the
woolly
locusts
are
now
gay
with
monardella
clarkia
coreopsis
and
tall
tufted
grasses
some
of
them
tall
enough
to
wave
like
pines
the
lupines
of
which
there
are
many
species
are
now
mostly
out
of
flower
and
many
of
the
composit脱
are
beginning
to
fade
their
radiant
corollas
vanishing
in
fluffy
pappus
like
stars
in
mist
we
had
another
visitor
from
brown
flat
an
old
indian
woman
with
a
basket
on
her
back
like
our
first
caller
from
the
village
she
got
fairly
into
camp
and
was
standing
in
plain
view
when
discovered
how
long
she
had
been
quietly
looking
on
i
can
not
say
even
the
dogs
failed
to
notice
her
stealthy
approach
she
was
on
her
way
i
suppose
to
some
wild
garden
probably
for
lupine
and
starchy
saxifrage
leaves
and
rootstocks
her
dress
was
calico
rags
far
from
clean
in
every
way
she
seemed
sadly
unlike
nature
neat
animals
though
living
like
them
on
the
bounty
of
the
wilderness
strange
that
mankind
alone
is
dirty
had
she
been
clad
in
fur
or
cloth
woven
of
grass
or
shreddy
bark
like
the
juniper
and
libocedrus
mats
she
might
then
have
seemed
a
rightful
part
of
the
wilderness
like
a
good
wolf
at
least
or
bear
but
from
no
point
of
view
that
i
have
found
are
such
debased
fellow
beings
a
whit
more
natural
than
the
glaring
tailored
tourists
we
saw
that
frightened
the
birds
and
squirrels
pure
sunshine
all
day
how
beautiful
a
rock
is
made
by
leaf
shadows
those
of
the
live
oak
are
particularly
clear
and
distinct
and
beyond
all
art
in
grace
and
delicacy
now
still
as
if
painted
on
stone
now
gliding
softly
as
if
afraid
of
noise
now
dancing
waltzing
in
swift
merry
swirls
or
jumping
on
and
off
sunny
rocks
in
quick
dashes
like
wave
embroidery
on
seashore
cliffs
how
true
and
substantial
is
this
shadow
beauty
and
with
what
sublime
extravagance
is
beauty
thus
multiplied
the
big
orange
lilies
are
now
arrayed
in
all
their
glory
of
leaf
and
flower
noble
plants
in
perfect
health
nature
darlings
some
of
the
silly
sheep
got
caught
fast
in
a
tangle
of
chaparral
this
morning
like
flies
in
a
spider
web
and
had
to
be
helped
out
carlo
found
them
and
tried
to
drive
them
from
the
trap
by
the
easiest
way
how
far
above
sheep
are
intelligent
dogs
no
friend
and
helper
can
be
more
affectionate
and
constant
than
carlo
the
noble
bernard
is
an
honor
to
his
race
the
air
is
distinctly
fragrant
with
balsam
and
resin
and
mint
every
breath
of
it
a
gift
we
may
well
thank
god
for
who
could
ever
guess
that
so
rough
a
wilderness
should
yet
be
so
fine
so
full
of
good
things
one
seems
to
be
in
a
majestic
domed
pavilion
in
which
a
grand
play
is
being
acted
with
scenery
and
music
and
incense
all
the
furniture
and
action
so
interesting
we
are
in
no
danger
of
being
called
on
to
endure
one
dull
moment
god
himself
seems
to
be
always
doing
his
best
here
working
like
a
man
in
a
glow
of
enthusiasm
sauntered
along
the
to
my
lily
gardens
the
perfection
of
beauty
in
these
lilies
of
the
wilderness
is
a
source
of
admiration
and
wonder
their
rhizomes
are
set
in
black
mould
accumulated
in
hollows
of
the
metamorphic
slates
beside
the
pools
where
they
are
well
watered
without
being
subjected
to
flood
action
every
leaf
in
the
level
whorls
around
the
tall
polished
stalks
is
as
finely
finished
as
the
petals
and
the
light
and
heat
required
are
measured
for
them
and
tempered
in
passing
through
the
branches
of
trees
however
strong
the
winds
from
the
noon
rainstorms
they
are
securely
sheltered
beautiful
hypnum
carpets
bordered
with
ferns
are
spread
beneath
them
violets
too
and
a
few
daisies
everything
around
them
sweet
and
fresh
like
themselves
cloudland
is
only
a
solitary
white
mountain
but
it
is
so
enriched
with
sunshine
and
shade
the
tones
of
color
on
its
big
domed
head
and
bossy
outbulging
ridges
and
in
the
hollows
and
ravines
between
them
are
ineffably
fine
unusually
cloudy
besides
the
periodical
cumuli
there
is
a
thin
diffused
cloud
overhead
about
in
all
oh
these
vast
calm
measureless
mountain
days
inciting
at
once
to
work
and
rest
days
in
whose
light
everything
seems
equally
divine
opening
a
thousand
windows
to
show
us
god
nevermore
however
weary
should
one
faint
by
the
way
who
gains
the
blessings
of
one
mountain
day
whatever
his
fate
long
life
short
life
stormy
or
calm
he
is
rich
forever

shepherd
billy
is
in
a
peck
of
trouble
about
the
sheep
he
declares
that
they
are
possessed
with
more
of
the
evil
one
than
any
other
flock
from
the
beginning
of
the
invention
of
mutton
and
wool
to
the
last
batch
of
it
no
matter
how
many
are
missing
he
will
not
he
says
go
a
step
to
seek
them
because
as
he
reasons
while
getting
back
one
wanderer
he
would
probably
lose
ten
therefore

billy
little
dog
jack
is
also
giving
trouble
by
leaving
camp
every
night
to
visit
his
neighbors
up
the
mountain
at
brown
flat
he
is
a
cur
of
no
particular
breed
but
tremendously
enterprising
in
love
and
war
he
has
cut
all
the
ropes
and
leather
straps
he
has
been
tied
with
until
his
master
in
desperation
after
climbing
the
brushy
mountain
again
and
again
to
drag
him
back
fastened
him
with
a
pole
attached
to
his
collar
under
his
chin
at
one
end
and
to
a
stout
sapling
at
the
other
but
the
pole
gave
good
leverage
and
by
constant
twisting
during
the
night
the
fastening
at
the
sapling
end
was
chafed
off
and
he
set
out
on
his
usual
journey
dragging
the
pole
through
the
brush
and
reached
the
indian
settlement
in
safety
his
master
followed
and
making
no
allowance
gave
him
a
beating
and
swore
in
bad
terms
that
next
evening
he
would
fix
that
infatuated
pup
by
anchoring
him
unmercifully
to
the
heavy
lid
of
our
dutch
oven
weighing
about
as
much
as
the
dog
it
was
linked
directly
to
his
collar
close
up
under
the
chin
so
that
the
poor
fellow
seemed
unable
to
stir
he
stood
quite
discouraged
until
after
dark
unable
to
look
about
him
or
even
to
lie
down
unless
he
stretched
himself
out
with
his
front
feet
across
the
lid
and
his
head
close
down
between
his
paws
before
morning
however
jack
was
heard
far
up
the
height
howling
excelsior
anchor
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
he
must
have
walked
or
rather
climbed
erect
on
his
hind
legs
clasping
the
heavy
lid
like
a
shield
against
his
breast
a
formidable
condition
in
which
to
meet
his
rivals
next
night
dog
and
all
were
tied
up
in
an
old
and
thus
at
last
angry
billy
gained
the
victory
just
before
leaving
home
jack
was
bitten
in
the
lower
jaw
by
a
rattlesnake
and
for
a
week
or
so
his
head
and
neck
were
swollen
to
more
than
double
the
normal
size
nevertheless
he
ran
about
as
brisk
and
lively
as
ever
and
is
now
completely
recovered
the
only
treatment
he
got
was
fresh
milk
a
gallon
or
two
at
a
time
forcibly
poured
down
his
sore
poisoned
throat
though
only
a
sheep
camp
this
grand
mountain
hollow
is

sweet
home
every
day
growing
sweeter
and
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
it
the
lily
gardens
are
safe
as
yet
from
the
trampling
flock
poor
dusty
raggedy
famishing
creatures
i
heartily
pity
them
many
a
mile
they
must
go
every
day
to
gather
their
fifteen
or
twenty
tons
of
chaparral
and
grass
nuttall
flowering
dogwood
makes
a
fine
show
when
in
bloom
the
whole
tree
is
then
snowy
white
the
involucres
are
six
to
eight
inches
wide
along
the
streams
it
is
a
tree
thirty
to
fifty
feet
high
with
a
broad
head
when
not
crowded
by
companions
its
showy
involucres
attract
a
crowd
of
moths
butterflies
and
other
winged
people
about
it
for
their
own
and
i
suppose
the
tree
advantage
it
likes
plenty
of
cool
water
and
is
a
great
drinker
like
the
alder
willow
and
cottonwood
and
flourishes
best
on
stream
banks
though
it
often
wanders
far
from
streams
in
damp
shady
glens
beneath
the
pines
where
it
is
much
smaller
when
the
leaves
ripen
in
the
fall
they
become
more
beautiful
than
the
flowers
displaying
charming
tones
of
red
purple
and
lavender
another
species
grows
in
abundance
as
a
chaparral
shrub
on
the
shady
sides
of
the
hills
probably
the
leaves
are
eaten
by
the
heard
a
few
lightning
strokes
in
the
distance
with
rumbling
mumbling
reverberations
the
beaked
hazel
var
is
common
on
cool
slopes
up
toward
the
summit
of
the
pilot
peak
ridge
there
is
something
peculiarly
attractive
in
the
hazel
like
the
oaks
and
heaths
of
the
cool
countries
of
our
forefathers
and
through
them
our
love
for
these
plants
has
i
suppose
been
transmitted
this
species
is
four
or
five
feet
high
leaves
soft
and
hairy
grateful
to
the
touch
and
the
delicious
nuts
are
eagerly
gathered
by
indians
and
squirrels
the
sky
as
usual
adorned
with
white
noon
clouds
warm
mellow
summer
the
glowing
sunbeams
make
every
nerve
tingle
the
new
needles
of
the
pines
and
firs
are
nearly
full
grown
and
shine
gloriously
lizards
are
glinting
about
on
the
hot
rocks
some
that
live
near
the
camp
are
more
than
half
tame
they
seem
attentive
to
every
movement
on
our
part
as
if
curious
to
simply
look
on
without
suspicion
of
harm
turning
their
heads
to
look
back
and
making
a
variety
of
pretty
gestures
gentle
guileless
creatures
with
beautiful
eyes
i
shall
be
sorry
to
leave
them
when
we
leave
camp
i
have
been
making
the
acquaintance
of
a
very
interesting
little
bird
that
flits
about
the
falls
and
rapids
of
the
main
branches
of
the
river
it
is
not
a
in
structure
though
it
gets
its
living
in
the
water
and
never
leaves
the
streams
it
is
not
yet
it
dives
fearlessly
into
deep
swirling
rapids
evidently
to
feed
at
the
bottom
using
its
wings
to
swim
with
under
water
just
as
ducks
and
loons
do
sometimes
it
wades
about
in
shallow
places
thrusting
its
head
under
from
time
to
time
in
a
jerking
nodding
frisky
way
that
is
sure
to
attract
attention
it
is
about
the
size
of
a
robin
has
short
crisp
wings
serviceable
for
flying
either
in
water
or
air
and
a
tail
of
moderate
size
slanted
upward
giving
it
with
its
nodding
bobbing
manners
a
wrennish
look
its
color
is
plain
bluish
ash
with
a
tinge
of
brown
on
the
head
and
shoulders
it
flies
from
fall
to
fall
rapid
to
rapid
with
a
solid
whir
of
like
those
of
a
quail
follows
the
windings
of
the
stream
and
usually
alights
on
some
rock
jutting
up
out
of
the
current
or
on
some
stranded
snag
or
rarely
on
the
dry
limb
of
an
overhanging
tree
perching
like
regular
tree
birds
when
it
suits
its
convenience
it
has
the
oddest
daintiest
mincing
manners
imaginable
and
the
little
fellow
can
sing
too
a
sweet
thrushy
fluty
song
rather
low
not
the
least
boisterous
and
much
less
keen
and
accentuated
than
from
its
vigorous
briskness
one
would
be
led
to
look
for
what
a
romantic
life
this
little
bird
leads
on
the
most
beautiful
portions
of
the
streams
in
a
genial
climate
with
shade
and
cool
water
and
spray
to
temper
the
summer
heat
no
wonder
it
is
a
fine
singer
considering
the
stream
songs
it
hears
day
and
night
every
breath
the
little
poet
draws
is
part
of
a
song
for
all
the
air
about
the
rapids
and
falls
is
beaten
into
music
and
its
first
lessons
must
begin
before
it
is
born
by
the
thrilling
and
quivering
of
the
eggs
in
unison
with
the
tones
of
the
falls
i
have
not
yet
found
its
nest
but
it
must
be
near
the
streams
for
it
never
leaves
them
half
cloudy
half
sunny
clouds
lustrous
white
the
tall
pines
crowded
along
the
top
of
the
pilot
peak
ridge
look
like
miniatures
exquisitely
outlined
on
the
satiny
sky
average
cloudiness
for
the
day
about
no
rain
and
so
this
memorable
month
ends
a
stream
of
beauty
unmeasured
no
more
to
be
sectioned
off
by
almanac
arithmetic
than
or
the
currents
of
seas
and
rivers
a
peaceful
joyful
stream
of
beauty
every
morning
arising
from
the
death
of
sleep
the
happy
plants
and
all
our
fellow
animal
creatures
great
and
small
and
even
the
rocks
seemed
to
be
shouting
awake
awake
rejoice
rejoice
come
love
us
and
join
in
our
song
come
come
looking
back
through
the
stillness
and
romantic
enchanting
beauty
and
peace
of
the
camp
grove
this
june
seems
the
greatest
of
all
the
months
of
my
life
the
most
truly
divinely
free
boundless
like
eternity
immortal
everything
in
it
seems
equally
divine
one
smooth
pure
wild
glow
of
heaven
love
never
to
be
blotted
or

by
anything

summer
is
ripe
flocks
of
seeds
are
already
out
of
their
cups
and
pods
seeking
their
predestined
places
some
will
strike
root
and
grow
up
beside
their
parents
others
flying
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
far
from
them
among
strangers
most
of
the
young
birds
are
full
feathered
and
out
of
their
nests
though
still
looked
after
by
both
father
and
mother
protected
and
fed
and
to
some

educated
how
beautiful
the

of

no

we
all
love
them

douglas
squirrel
observing
brother
man
i
like
to
watch
the
squirrels
there
are
two
species
here
the
large
california
gray
and
the
douglas
the
latter
is
the
brightest
of
all
the
squirrels
i
have
ever
seen
a
hot
spark
of
life
making
every
tree
tingle
with
his
prickly
toes
a
condensed
nugget
of
fresh
mountain
vigor
and
valor
as
free
from
disease
as
a
sunbeam
one
can
not
think
of
such
an
animal
ever
being
weary
or
sick
he
seems
to
think
the
mountains
belong
to
him
and
at
first
tried
to
drive
away
the
whole
flock
of
sheep
as
well
as
the
shepherd
and
dogs
how
he
scolds
and
what
faces
he
makes
all
eyes
teeth
and
whiskers
if
not
so
comically
small
he
would
indeed
be
a
dreadful
fellow
i
should
like
to
know
more
about
his
bringing
up
his
life
in
the
home
as
well
as
in
the
throughout
all
seasons
strange
that
i
have
not
yet
found
a
nest
full
of
young
ones
the
douglas
is
nearly
allied
to
the
red
squirrel
of
the
atlantic
slope
and
may
have
been
distributed
to
this
side
of
the
continent
by
way
of
the
great
unbroken
forests
of
the
north
the
california
gray
is
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
next
to
the
douglas
the
most
interesting
of
our
hairy
neighbors
compared
with
the
douglas
he
is
twice
as
large
but
far
less
lively
and
influential
as
a
worker
in
the
woods
and
he
manages
to
make
his
way
through
leaves
and
branches
with
less
stir
than
his
small
brother
i
have
never
heard
him
bark
at
anything
except
our
dogs
when
in
search
of
food
he
glides
silently
from
branch
to
branch
examining
last
year
cones
to
see
whether
some
few
seeds
may
not
be
left
between
the
scales
or
gleans
fallen
ones
among
the
leaves
on
the
ground
since
none
of
the
present
season
crop
is
yet
available
his
tail
floats
now
behind
him
now
above
him
level
or
gracefully
curled
like
a
wisp
of
cirrus
cloud
every
hair
in
its
place
clean
and
shining
and
radiant
as
in
spite
of
rough
gummy
work
his
whole
body
seems
about
as
unsubstantial
as
his
tail
the
little
douglas
is
fiery
peppery
full
of
brag
and
fight
and
show
with
movements
so
quick
and
keen
they
almost
sting
the
onlooker
and
the
harlequin
gyrating
show
he
makes
of
himself
turns
one
giddy
to
see
the
gray
is
shy
and
oftentimes
stealthy
in
his
movements
as
if
half
expecting
an
enemy
in
every
tree
and
bush
and
back
of
every
log
wishing
only
to
be
let
alone
apparently
and
manifesting
no
desire
to
be
seen
or
admired
or
feared
the
indians
hunt
this
species
for
food
a
good
cause
for
caution
not
to
mention
other

pool
where
in
hot
and
dry
weather
they
drink
at
nearly
the

these

to

he

and
his

also
is
as
unlike

as
may
be
though
softly
furnished
inside
no
other
animal
inhabitant
of

builds
houses
so
large
and
striking
in
appearance
the
traveler
coming
suddenly
upon
a
group
of
them
for
the
first
time
will
not
be
likely
to
forget
them
they
are
built
of
all
kinds
of

picked
up
anywhere

bitten
from

more

coming
through
the
dense
shaggy
thickets
of
some
lonely
hillside
the
solitary
explorer
happening
into
one
of
these
strange
villages
is
startled
at
the
sight
and
may
fancy
himself
in
an
indian
settlement
and
begin
to
wonder
what
kind
of
reception
he
is
likely
to
get
but
no
savage
face
will
he
see
perhaps
not
a
single
inhabitant
or
at
most
two
or
three
seated
on
top
of
their
wigwams
looking
at
the
stranger
with
the
mildest
of
wild
eyes
and
allowing
a
near
approach
in
the

of

rough
spiky

made
of
the
inner
fibres
of

to

of

as
willow
and

the
delicate

its
prickly

some
of
the

are
built
in
trees
thirty
or
forty
feet
from
the
ground
and
even
in

as
if

the
company
and
protection
of

reputation
of

he
carries

everything
transportable

merely
however
to
strengthen
his
fortifications
i
guess
his
food
at

as
far
as
i
have
learned
is
nearly
the
same
as
that
of
the

prime
marvel
to
me
and
i
gaze
at
the
stupendous
white
domes
miles
high
with
ever
fresh
admiration
but
in
the
midst
of
these
sky
and
mountain
affairs
a
change
of
diet
is
pulling
us
down
we
have
been
out
of
bread
a
few
days
and
begin
to
miss
it
more
than
seems
reasonable
for
we
have
plenty
of
meat
and
sugar
and
tea
strange
we
should
feel
in
so
rich
a
wilderness
the
indians
put
us
to
shame
so
do
the
squirrels
starchy
roots
and
seeds
and
bark
in
abundance
yet
the
failure
of
the
meal
sack
disturbs
our
bodily
balance
and
threatens
our
best
enjoyments
warm
breeze
just
enough
to
sift
through
the
woods
and
waft
fragrance
from
their
thousand
fountains
the
pine
and
fir
cones
are
growing
well
resin
and
balsam
dripping
from
every
tree
and
seeds
are
ripening
fast
promising
a
fine
harvest
the
squirrels
will
have
bread
they
eat
all
kinds
of
nuts
long
before
they
are
ripe
and
yet
never
seem
to
suffer
in
stomach
chapter
iii
a
bread
famine
the
air
beyond
the
flock
range
full
of
the
essences
of
the
woods
is
growing
sweeter
and
more
fragrant
from
day
to
day
like
ripening
fruit
delaney
is
expected
to
arrive
soon
from
the
lowlands
with
a
new
stock
of
provisions
and
as
the
flock
is
to
be
moved
to
fresh
pastures
we
shall
all
be
well
fed
in
the
mean
time
our
stock
of
beans
as
well
as
flour
has
failed
everything
but
mutton
sugar
and
tea
the
shepherd
is
somewhat
demoralized
and
seems
to
care
but
little
what
becomes
of
his
flock
he
says
that
since
the
boss
has
failed
to
feed
him
he
is
not
rightly
bound
to
feed
the
sheep
and
swears
that
no
decent
white
man
can
climb
these
steep
mountains
on
mutton
alone
it
not
fittin
grub
for
a
white
man
really
white
for
dogs
and
coyotes
and
indians
different
good
grub
good
sheep
that
what
i
say
such
was
fourth
of
july
oration
the
clouds
of
noon
on
the
high
sierra
seem
yet
more
marvelously
indescribably
beautiful
from
day
to
day
as
one
becomes
more
wakeful
to
see
them
the
smoke
of
the
gunpowder
burned
yesterday
on
the
lowlands
and
the
eloquence
of
the
orators
has
probably
settled
or
been
blown
away
by
this
time
here
every
day
is
a
holiday
a
jubilee
ever
sounding
with
serene
enthusiasm
without
wear
or
waste
or
cloying
weariness
everything
rejoicing
not
a
single
cell
or
crystal
unvisited
or
forgotten
delaney
has
not
arrived
and
the
bread
famine
is
sore
we
must
eat
mutton
a
while
longer
though
it
seems
hard
to
get
accustomed
to
it
i
have
heard
of
texas
pioneers
living
without
bread
or
anything
made
from
the
cereals
for
months
without
suffering
using
the
of
wild
turkeys
for
bread
of
this
kind
they
had
plenty
in
the
good
old
days
when
life
though
considered
less
safe
was
fussed
over
the
less
the
trappers
and
fur
traders
of
early
days
in
the
rocky
mountain
regions
lived
on
bison
and
beaver
meat
for
months
too
there
are
among
both
indians
and
whites
who
seem
to
suffer
little
or
not
at
all
from
the
want
of
bread
just
at
this
moment
mutton
seems
the
least
desirable
of
food
though
of
good
quality
we
pick
out
the
leanest
bits
and
down
they
go
against
heavy
disgust
causing
nausea
and
an
effort
to
reject
the
offensive
stuff
tea
makes
matters
worse
if
possible
the
stomach
begins
to
assert
itself
as
an
independent
creature
with
a
will
of
its
own
we
should
boil
lupine
leaves
clover
starchy
petioles
and
saxifrage
rootstocks
like
the
indians
we
try
to
ignore
our
gastric
troubles
rise
and
gaze
about
us
turn
our
eyes
to
the
mountains
and
climb
doggedly
up
through
brush
and
rocks
into
the
heart
of
the
scenery
a
stifled
calm
comes
on
and
the
day
duties
and
even
enjoyments
are
languidly
got
through
with
we
chew
a
few
leaves
of
ceanothus
by
way
of
luncheon
and
smell
or
chew
the
spicy
monardella
for
the
dull
headache
and
that
now
lightens
now
comes
muffling
down
upon
us
and
into
us
like
fog
at
night
more
mutton
flesh
to
flesh
down
with
it
not
too
much
and
there
are
the
stars
shining
through
the
cedar
plumes
and
branches
above
our
beds
rather
weak
and
sickish
this
morning
and
all
about
a
piece
of
bread
can
scarce
command
attention
to
my
best
studies
as
if
one
could
take
a
few
days
saunter
in
the
godful
woods
without
maintaining
a
base
on
a
and
gristmill
like
caged
parrots
we
want
a
cracker
any
of
the
hundred
kinds
the
remainder
biscuit
of
a
voyage
around
the
world
would
answer
well
enough
nor
would
the
wholesomeness
of
saleratus
biscuit
be
questioned
bread
without
flesh
is
a
good
diet
as
on
many
botanical
excursions
i
have
proved
tea
also
may
easily
be
ignored
just
bread
and
water
and
delightful
toil
is
all
i
need
not
unreasonably
much
yet
one
ought
to
be
trained
and
tempered
to
enjoy
life
in
these
brave
wilds
in
full
independence
of
any
particular
kind
of
nourishment
that
this
may
be
accomplished
is
manifest
as
far
as
bodily
welfare
is
concerned
in
the
lives
of
people
of
other
climes
the
eskimo
for
example
gets
a
living
far
north
of
the
wheat
line
from
oily
seals
and
whales
meat
berries
bitter
weeds
and
blubber
or
only
the
last
for
months
at
a
time
and
yet
these
people
all
around
the
frozen
shores
of
our
continent
are
said
to
be
hearty
jolly
stout
and
brave
we
hear
too
of
carnivorous
as
spiders
yet
well
enough
as
far
as
stomachs
are
concerned
while
we
are
so
ridiculously
helpless
making
wry
faces
over
our
fare
looking
sheepish
in
digestive
distress
amid
rumbling
grumbling
sounds
that
might
well
pass
for
smothered
baas
we
have
a
large
supply
of
sugar
and
this
evening
it
occurred
to
me
that
these
belligerent
stomachs
might
possibly
like
complaining
children
be
coaxed
with
candy
accordingly
the
was
cleansed
and
a
lot
of
sugar
cooked
in
it
to
a
sort
of
wax
but
this
stuff
only
made
matters
worse
man
seems
to
be
the
only
animal
whose
food
soils
him
making
necessary
much
washing
and
bibs
and
napkins
moles
living
in
the
earth
and
eating
slimy
worms
are
yet
as
clean
as
seals
or
fishes
whose
lives
are
one
perpetual
and
as
we
have
seen
the
squirrels
in
these
resiny
woods
keep
themselves
clean
in
some
mysterious
way
not
a
hair
is
sticky
though
they
handle
the
gummy
cones
and
glide
about
apparently
without
care
the
birds
too
are
clean
though
they
seem
to
make
a
good
deal
of
fuss
washing
and
cleaning
their
feathers
certain
flies
and
ants
i
see
are
in
a
fix
entangled
and
sealed
up
in
the
we
threw
away
like
some
of
their
ancestors
in
amber
our
stomachs
like
tired
muscles
are
sore
with
long
squirming
once
i
was
very
hungry
in
the
bonaventure
graveyard
near
savannah
georgia
having
fasted
for
several
days
then
the
empty
stomach
seemed
to
chafe
in
much
the
same
way
as
now
and
a
somewhat
similar
tenderness
and
aching
was
produced
hard
to
bear
though
the
pain
was
not
acute
we
dream
of
bread
a
sure
sign
we
need
it
like
the
indians
we
ought
to
know
how
to
get
the
starch
out
of
fern
and
saxifrage
stalks
lily
bulbs
pine
bark
etc
our
education
has
been
sadly
neglected
for
many
generations
wild
rice
would
be
good
i
noticed
a
leersia
in
wet
meadow
edges
but
the
seeds
are
small
acorns
are
not
ripe
nor
pine
nuts
nor
filberts
the
inner
bark
of
pine
or
spruce
might
be
tried
drank
tea
until
half
intoxicated
man
seems
to
crave
a
stimulant
when
anything
extraordinary
is
going
on
and
this
is
the
only
one
i
use
billy
chews
great
quantities
of
tobacco
which
i
suppose
helps
to
stupefy
and
moderate
his
misery
we
look
and
listen
for
the
don
every
hour
how
beautiful
upon
the
mountains
his
big
feet
would
be
in
the
warm
hospitable
sierra
shepherds
and
mountain
men
in
general
as
far
as
i
have
seen
are
easily
satisfied
as
to
food
supplies
and
bedding
most
of
them
are
heartily
content
to
rough
it
ignoring
nature
fineness
as
bothersome
or
unmanly
the
shepherd
bed
is
often
only
the
bare
ground
and
a
pair
of
blankets
with
a
stone
a
piece
of
wood
or
a
for
a
pillow
in
choosing
the
spot
he
shows
less
care
than
the
dogs
for
they
usually
deliberate
before
making
up
their
minds
in
so
important
an
affair
going
from
place
to
place
scraping
away
loose
sticks
and
pebbles
and
trying
for
comfort
by
making
many
changes
while
the
shepherd
casts
himself
down
anywhere
seemingly
the
least
skilled
of
all
rest
seekers
his
food
too
even
when
he
has
all
he
wants
is
usually
far
from
delicate
either
in
kind
or
cooking
beans
bread
of
any
sort
bacon
mutton
dried
peaches
and
sometimes
potatoes
and
onions
make
up
his
the
two
latter
articles
being
regarded
as
luxuries
on
account
of
their
weight
as
compared
with
the
nourishment
they
contain
a
or
so
of
each
may
be
put
into
the
pack
in
setting
out
from
the
home
ranch
and
in
a
few
days
they
are
done
beans
are
the
main
standby
portable
wholesome
and
capable
of
going
far
besides
being
easily
cooked
although
curiously
enough
a
great
deal
of
mystery
is
supposed
to
lie
about
the
no
two
cooks
quite
agree
on
the
methods
of
making
beans
do
their
best
and
after
petting
and
coaxing
and
nursing
the
savory
mess
well
oiled
and
mellowed
with
bacon
boiled
into
the
heart
of
it
the
proud
cook
will
ask
after
dishing
out
a
quart
or
two
for
trial
well
how
do
you
like
beans
as
if
by
no
possibility
could
they
be
like
any
other
beans
cooked
in
the
same
way
but
must
needs
possess
some
special
virtue
of
which
he
alone
is
master
molasses
sugar
or
pepper
may
be
used
to
give
desired
flavors
or
the
first
water
may
be
poured
off
and
a
spoonful
or
two
of
ashes
or
soda
added
to
dissolve
or
soften
the
skins
more
fully
according
to
various
tastes
and
notions
but
like
casks
of
wine
no
two
potfuls
are
exactly
alike
to
every
palate
some
are
supposed
to
be
spoiled
by
the
moon
by
some
unlucky
day
by
the
beans
having
been
grown
on
soil
not
suitable
or
the
whole
year
may
be
to
blame
as
not
favorable
for
beans
coffee
too
has
its
marvels
in
the
camp
kitchen
but
not
so
many
and
not
so
inscrutable
as
those
that
beset
the
a
low
complacent
grunt
follows
a
mouthful
drawn
in
with
a
gurgle
and
the
remark
cast
forth
aimlessly
that
good
coffee
then
another
gurgling
sip
and
repetition
of
the
judgment
that
good
coffee
as
to
tea
there
are
but
two
kinds
weak
and
strong
the
stronger
the
better
the
only
remark
heard
is
that
tea
weak
otherwise
it
is
good
enough
and
not
worth
mentioning
if
it
has
been
boiled
an
hour
or
two
or
smoked
on
a
pitchy
fire
no
matter
who
cares
for
a
little
tannin
or
creosote
they
make
the
black
beverage
all
the
stronger
and
more
attractive
to
palates
bread
like
most
california
camp
bread
is
baked
in
dutch
ovens
some
of
it
in
the
form
of
yeast
powder
biscuit
an
unwholesome
sticky
compound
leading
straight
to
dyspepsia
the
greater
part
however
is
fermented
with
sour
dough
a
handful
from
each
batch
being
saved
and
put
away
in
the
mouth
of
the
flour
sack
to
inoculate
the
next
the
oven
is
simply
a
pot
about
five
inches
deep
and
from
twelve
to
eighteen
inches
wide
after
the
batch
has
been
mixed
and
kneaded
in
a
tin
pan
the
oven
is
slightly
heated
and
rubbed
with
a
piece
of
tallow
or
pork
rind
the
dough
is
then
placed
in
it
pressed
out
against
the
sides
and
left
to
rise
when
ready
for
baking
a
shovelful
of
coals
is
spread
out
by
the
side
of
the
fire
and
the
oven
set
upon
them
while
another
shovelful
is
placed
on
top
of
the
lid
which
is
raised
from
time
to
time
to
see
that
the
requisite
amount
of
heat
is
being
kept
up
with
care
good
bread
may
be
made
in
this
way
though
it
is
liable
to
be
burned
or
to
be
sour
or
raised
too
much
and
the
weight
of
the
oven
is
a
serious
objection
at
last

we
turn
our

and
we
go

never
while
anything
is
left
of
me
shall
this

be
forgotten
it
has
fairly
grown
into
me
not
merely
as

pictures
but
as
part

parcel
of
mind
and
body
alike
the
deep

with
its
majestic

through
which
all
the
wonderful

the

poured
their
beauty
the
flowery
wildness
of
the
high
steep

toward
brown
flat
and
its
descending
at
the
close
of
the
still

the
embowered
with
their

of

making
melody
the
stately

glad

caressing
the

swirling
in

dividing
against
little
flowery

breaking
gray

here
and

with

solemn
undertones
recalling
the

the
brave

ever
beside

among

like

the

its

gracefully

a

yards
from

ere
they
seemed
to
know
that
at
last
they
were
going
to
new
pastures
and
rushed
wildly
ahead
crowding
through
gaps
in
the

jumping
tumbling
like
exulting
hurrahing
escaping
through
a
broken

a
man
on

kept
shouting

the

who
in

were
behaving

the

at

was

the

suddenly
became
calm
like

in

thenceforward
they
were

to

them
headed
toward
the
summit
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
divide
soon
the
two
thousand
flattened
paunches
were
bulged
out
with
vines
and
grass
and
the
gaunt
desperate
creatures
more
like
wolves
than
sheep
became
bland
and
governable
while
the
howling
drivers
changed
to
gentle
shepherds
and
sauntered
in
peace
toward
sundown
we
reached
hazel
green
a
charming
spot
on
the
summit
of
the
dividing
ridge
between
the
basins
of
the
merced
and
tuolumne
where
there
is
a
small
brook
flowing
through
hazel
and
dogwood
thickets
beneath
magnificent
silver
firs
and
pines
here
we
are
camped
for
the
night
our
big
fire
heaped
high
with
rosiny
logs
and
branches
is
blazing
like
a
sunrise
gladly
giving
back
the
light
slowly
sifted
from
the
sunbeams
of
centuries
of
summers
and
in
the
glow
of
that
old
sunlight
how
impressively
surrounding
objects
are
brought
forward
in
relief
against
the
outer
darkness
grasses
larkspurs
columbines
lilies
hazel
bushes
and
the
great
trees
form
a
circle
around
the
fire
like
thoughtful
spectators
gazing
and
listening
with
enthusiasm
the
night
breeze
is
cool
for
all
day
we
have
been
climbing
into
the
upper
sky
the
home
of
the
cloud
mountains
we
so
long
have
admired
how
sweet
and
keen
the
air
every
breath
a
blessing
here
the
sugar
pine
reaches
its
fullest
development
in
size
and
beauty
and
number
of
individuals
filling
every
swell
and
hollow
and
ravine
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
other
species
a
few
yellow
pines
are
still
to
be
found
as
companions
and
in
the
coolest
places
silver
firs
but
noble
as
these
are
the
sugar
pine
is
king
and
spreads
long
protecting
arms
above
them
while
they
rock
and
wave
in
sign
of
recognition
we
have
now
reached
a
height
of
six
thousand
feet
in
the
forenoon
we
passed
along
a
flat
part
of
the
dividing
ridge
that
is
planted
with
manzanita
some
specimens
the
largest
i
have
seen
i
measured
one
the
bole
of
which
is
four
feet
in
diameter
and
only
eighteen
inches
high
from
the
ground
where
it
dissolves
into
many
branches
forming
a
broad
round
head
about
ten
or
twelve
feet
high
covered
with
clusters
of
small
pink
bells
the
leaves
are
pale
green
glandular
and
set
on
edge
by
a
twist
of
the
petiole
the
branches
seem
naked
for
the
bark
is
very
smooth
and
thin
and
is
shed
off
in
flakes
that
curl
when
dry
the
wood
is
red
hard
and
heavy
i
wonder
how
old
these
curious
are
probably
as
old
as
the
great
pines
indians
and
bears
and
birds
and
fat
grubs
feast
on
the
berries
which
look
like
small
apples
often
rosy
on
one
side
green
on
the
other
the
indians
are
said
to
make
a
kind
of
beer
or
cider
out
of
them
there
are
many
species
this
one
is
common
hereabouts
no
need
have
they
to
fear
the
wind
so
low
they
are
and
steadfastly
rooted
even
the
fires
that
sweep
the
woods
seldom
destroy
them
utterly
for
they
rise
again
from
the
root
and
some
of
the
dry
ridges
they
grow
on
are
seldom
touched
by
fire
i
must
try
to
know
them
better
i
miss
my
river
songs
here
hazel
creek
at
its
topmost
springs
has
a
voice
like
a
bird
the
in
the
great
trees
overhead
are
strangely
impressive
all
the
more
because
not
a
leaf
stirs
below
them
but
it
grows
late
and
i
must
to
bed
the
camp
is
silent
everybody
asleep
it
seems
extravagant
to
spend
hours
so
precious
in
sleep
he
giveth
his
beloved
sleep
pity
the
poor
beloved
needs
it
weak
weary
forspent
oh
the
pity
of
it
to
sleep
in
the
midst
of
eternal
beautiful
motion
instead
of
gazing
forever
like
the
stars
exhilarated
with
the
mountain
air
i
feel
like
shouting
this
morning
with
excess
of
wild
animal
joy
the
indian
lay
down
away
from
the
fire
last
night
without
blankets
having
nothing
on
by
way
of
clothing
but
a
pair
of
blue
overalls
and
a
calico
shirt
wet
with
sweat
the
night
air
is
chilly
at
this
elevation
and
we
gave
him
some
but
he
did
seem
to
care
for
them
a
fine
thing
to
be
independent
of
clothing
where
it
is
so
hard
to
carry
when
food
is
scarce
he
can
live
on
whatever
comes
in
his
way
a
few
berries
roots
bird
eggs
grasshoppers
black
ants
fat
wasp
or
bumblebee
larv脱
without
feeling
that
he
is
doing
anything
worth
mention
so
i
have
been
told
illustration
silver
fir
or
red
fir
abies
magnifica
our
course
was
along
the
broad
top
of
the
main
ridge
to
a
hollow
beyond
crane
flat
it
is
scarce
at
all
rocky
and
is
covered
with
the
noblest
pines
and
spruces
i
have
yet
seen
sugar
pines
from
six
to
eight
feet
in
diameter
are
not
uncommon
with
a
height
of
two
hundred
feet
or
even
more
the
silver
firs
and
are
exceedingly
beautiful
especially
the
which
becomes
more
abundant
the
higher
we
go
it
is
of
great
size
one
of
the
most
notable
in
every
way
of
the
giant
conifers
of
the
sierra
i
saw
specimens
that
measured
seven
feet
in
diameter
and
over
two
hundred
feet
in
height
while
the
average
size
for
what
might
be
called
mature
trees
can
hardly
be
less
than
one
hundred
and
eighty
or
two
hundred
feet
high
and
five
or
six
feet
in
diameter
and
with
these
noble
dimensions
there
is
a
symmetry
and
perfection
of
finish
not
to
be
seen
in
any
other
tree
hereabout
at
least
the
branches
are
whorled
in
fives
mostly
and
stand
out
from
the
tall
straight
exquisitely
tapered
bole
in
level
collars
each
branch
regularly
pinnated
like
the
fronds
of
ferns
and
densely
clad
with
leaves
all
around
the
branchlets
thus
giving
them
a
singularly
rich
and
sumptuous
appearance
the
extreme
top
of
the
tree
is
a
thick
blunt
shoot
pointing
straight
to
the
zenith
like
an
admonishing
finger
the
cones
stand
erect
like
casks
on
the
upper
branches
they
are
about
six
inches
long
three
in
diameter
blunt
velvety
and
cylindrical
in
form
and
very
rich
and
precious
looking
the
seeds
are
about
three
quarters
of
an
inch
long
dark
reddish
brown
with
brilliant
iridescent
purple
wings
and
when
ripe
the
cone
falls
to
pieces
and
the
seeds
thus
set
free
at
a
height
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
or
two
hundred
feet
have
a
good
send
off
and
may
fly
considerable
distances
in
a
good
breeze
and
it
is
when
a
good
breeze
is
blowing
that
most
of
them
are
shaken
free
to
fly
the
other
species
attains
nearly
as
great
a
height
and
thickness
as
the
but
the
branches
do
not
form
such
regular
whorls
nor
are
they
so
exactly
pinnated
or
richly
instead
of
growing
all
around
the
branchlets
the
leaves
are
mostly
arranged
in
two
flat
horizontal
rows
the
cones
and
seeds
are
like
those
of
the
in
form
but
less
than
half
as
large
the
bark
of
the
is
reddish
purple
and
closely
furrowed
that
of
the
gray
and
widely
furrowed
a
noble
pair
at
crane
flat
we
climbed
a
thousand
feet
or
more
in
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
the
forest
growing
more
dense
and
the
silvery
fir
forming
a
still
greater
portion
of
the
whole
crane
flat
is
a
meadow
with
a
wide
sandy
border
lying
on
the
top
of
the
divide
it
is
often
visited
by
blue
cranes
to
rest
and
feed
on
their
long
journeys
hence
the
name
it
is
about
half
a
mile
long
draining
into
the
merced
sedgy
in
the
middle
with
a
margin
bright
with
lilies
columbines
larkspurs
lupines
castilleia
then
an
outer
zone
of
dry
gently
sloping
ground
starred
with
a
multitude
of
small
flowers
eunanus
mimulus
gilia
with
rosettes
of
spraguea
and
tufts
of
several
species
of
eriogonum
and
the
brilliant
zauschneria
the
noble
forest
wall
about
it
is
made
up
of
the
two
silver
firs
and
the
yellow
and
sugar
pines
which
here
seem
to
reach
their
highest
pitch
of
beauty
and
grandeur
for
the
elevation
six
thousand
feet
or
a
little
more
is
not
too
great
for
the
sugar
and
yellow
pines
or
too
low
for
the
fir
while
the
seems
to
find
this
elevation
the
best
possible
about
a
mile
from
the
north
end
of
the
flat
there
is
a
grove
of
the
king
of
all
the
conifers
furthermore
the
douglas
spruce
and
and
a
few
pines
occur
here
and
there
forming
a
small
part
of
the
forest
three
pines
two
silver
firs
one
douglas
spruce
one
sequoia
all
of
them
except
the
pine
colossal
trees
are
found
here
together
an
assemblage
of
conifers
unrivaled
on
the
globe
we
passed
a
number
of
charming
meadows
lying
on
top
of
the
divide
or
hanging
like
ribbons
down
its
sides
imbedded
in
the
glorious
forest
some
are
taken
up
chiefly
with
the
tall
with
leaves
about
a
foot
long
eight
or
ten
inches
wide
and
veined
like
those
of
cypripedium
a
robust
hearty
liliaceous
plant
fond
of
water
and
determined
to
be
seen
columbine
and
larkspur
grow
on
the
dryer
edges
of
the
meadows
with
a
tall
handsome
lupine
standing
in
long
grasses
and
sedges
castilleias
too
of
several
species
make
a
bright
show
with
beds
of
violets
at
their
feet
but
the
glory
of
these
forest
meadows
is
a
lily
the
tallest
are
from
seven
to
eight
feet
high
with
magnificent
racemes
of
ten
to
twenty
or
more
small
flowers
they
stand
out
free
in
open
ground
with
just
enough
grass
and
other
companion
plants
about
them
to
fringe
their
feet
and
show
them
off
to
best
advantage
this
is
a
grand
addition
to
my
lily
acquaintances
a
true
mountaineer
reaching
prime
vigor
and
beauty
at
a
height
of
seven
thousand
feet
or
thereabouts
it
varies
i
find
very
much
in
size
even
in
the
same
meadow
not
only
with
the
soil
but
with
age
i
saw
a
specimen
that
had
only
one
flower
and
another
within
a
stone
throw
had
and
to
think
that
the
sheep
should
be
allowed
in
these
lily
meadows
after
how
many
centuries
of
nature
care
planting
and
watering
them
tucking
the
bulbs
in
snugly
below
winter
frost
shading
the
tender
shoots
with
clouds
drawn
above
them
like
curtains
pouring
refreshing
rain
making
them
perfect
in
beauty
and
keeping
them
safe
by
a
thousand
miracles
yet
strange
to
say
allowing
the
trampling
of
devastating
sheep
one
might
reasonably
look
for
a
wall
of
fire
to
fence
such
gardens
so
extravagant
is
nature
with
her
choicest
treasures
spending
plant
beauty
as
she
spends
sunshine
pouring
it
forth
into
land
and
sea
garden
and
desert
and
so
the
beauty
of
lilies
falls
on
angels
and
men
bears
and
squirrels
wolves
and
sheep
birds
and
bees
but
as
far
as
i
have
seen
man
alone
and
the
animals
he
tames
destroy
these
gardens
awkward
lumbering
bears
the
don
tells
me
love
to
wallow
in
them
in
hot
weather
and
deer
with
their
sharp
feet
cross
them
again
and
again
sauntering
and
feeding
yet
never
a
lily
have
i
seen
spoiled
by
them
rather
like
gardeners
they
seem
to
cultivate
them
pressing
and
dibbling
as
required
anyhow
not
a
leaf
or
petal
seems
misplaced
the
trees
round
about
them
seem
as
perfect
in
beauty
and
form
as
the
lilies
their
boughs
whorled
like
lily
leaves
in
exact
order
this
evening
as
usual
the
glow
of
our
is
working
enchantment
on
everything
within
reach
of
its
rays
lying
beneath
the
firs
it
is
glorious
to
see
them
dipping
their
spires
in
the
starry
sky
the
sky
like
one
vast
lily
meadow
in
bloom
how
can
i
close
my
eyes
on
so
precious
a
night
a
douglas
squirrel
peppery
pungent
autocrat
of
the
woods
is
barking
overhead
this
morning
and
the
small
forest
birds
so
seldom
seen
when
one
travels
noisily
are
out
on
sunny
branches
along
the
edge
of
the
meadow
getting
warm
taking
a
sun
bath
and
dew
bath
a
fine
sight
how
charming
the
sprightly
confident
looks
and
ways
of
these
little
feathered
people
of
the
trees
they
seem
sure
of
dainty
wholesome
breakfasts
and
where
are
so
many
breakfasts
to
come
from
how
helpless
should
we
find
ourselves
should
we
try
to
set
a
table
for
them
of
such
buds
seeds
insects
as
would
keep
them
in
the
pure
wild
health
they
enjoy
not
a
headache
or
any
other
ache
amongst
them
i
guess
as
for
the
irrepressible
douglas
squirrels
one
never
thinks
of
their
breakfasts
or
the
possibility
of
hunger
sickness
or
death
rather
they
seem
like
stars
above
chance
or
change
even
though
we
may
see
them
at
times
busy
gathering
burrs
working
hard
for
a
living
on
through
the
forest
ever
higher
we
go
a
cloud
of
dust
dimming
the
way
thousands
of
feet
trampling
leaves
and
flowers
but
in
this
mighty
wilderness
they
seem
but
a
feeble
band
and
a
thousand
gardens
will
escape
their
blighting
touch
they
can
not
hurt
the
trees
though
some
of
the
seedlings
suffer
and
should
the
woolly
locusts
be
greatly
multiplied
as
on
account
of
dollar
value
they
are
likely
to
be
then
the
forests
too
may
in
time
be
destroyed
only
the
sky
will
then
be
safe
though
hid
from
view
by
dust
and
smoke
incense
of
a
bad
sacrifice
poor
helpless
hungry
sheep
in
great
part
misbegotten
without
good
right
to
be
made
less
by
god
than
man
born
out
of
time
and
place
yet
their
voices
are
strangely
human
and
call
out
one
pity
our
way
is
still
along
the
merced
and
tuolumne
divide
the
streams
on
our
right
going
to
swell
the
songful
yosemite
river
those
on
our
left
to
the
songful
tuolumne
slipping
through
sunny
carex
and
lily
meadows
and
breaking
into
song
down
a
thousand
ravines
almost
as
soon
as
they
are
born
a
more
tuneful
set
of
streams
surely
nowhere
exists
or
more
sparkling
crystal
pure
now
gliding
with
tinkling
whisper
now
with
merry
dimpling
rush
in
and
out
through
sunshine
and
shade
shimmering
in
pools
uniting
their
currents
bouncing
dancing
from
form
to
form
over
cliffs
and
inclines
ever
more
beautiful
the
farther
they
go
until
they
pour
into
the
main
glacial
rivers
all
day
i
have
been
gazing
in
growing
admiration
at
the
noble
groups
of
the
magnificent
silver
fir
which
more
and
more
is
taking
the
ground
to
itself
the
woods
above
crane
flat
still
continue
comparatively
open
letting
in
the
sunshine
on
the
brown
ground
not
only
are
the
individual
trees
admirable
in
symmetry
and
superb
in
foliage
and
port
but
half
a
dozen
or
more
often
form
temple
groves
in
which
the
trees
are
so
nicely
graded
in
size
and
position
as
to
seem
one
here
indeed
is
the
paradise
the
dullest
eye
in
the
world
must
surely
be
quickened
by
such
trees
as
these
fortunately
the
sheep
need
little
attention
as
they
are
driven
slowly
and
allowed
to
nip
and
nibble
as
they
like
since
leaving
hazel
green
we
have
been
following
the
yosemite
trail
visitors
to
the
famous
valley
coming
by
way
of
coulterville
and
chinese
camp
pass
this
way
the
two
trails
uniting
at
crane
flat
and
enter
the
valley
on
the
north
side
another
trail
enters
on
the
south
side
by
way
of
mariposa
the
tourists
we
saw
were
in
parties
of
from
three
or
four
to
fifteen
or
twenty
mounted
on
mules
or
small
mustang
ponies
a
strange
show
they
made
winding
single
file
through
the
solemn
woods
in
gaudy
attire
scaring
the
wild
creatures
and
one
might
fancy
that
even
the
great
pines
would
be
disturbed
and
groan
aghast
but
what
may
we
say
of
ourselves
and
the
flock
we
are
now
camped
at
tamarack
flat
within
four
or
five
miles
of
the
lower
end
of
yosemite
here
is
another
fine
meadow
embosomed
in
the
woods
with
a
deep
clear
stream
gliding
through
it
its
banks
rounded
and
beveled
with
a
thatch
of
dipping
sedges
the
flat
is
named
after
the
pine
var
common
here
especially
around
the
cool
margin
of
the
meadow
on
rocky
ground
it
is
a
rough
thickset
tree
about
forty
to
sixty
feet
high
and
one
to
three
feet
in
diameter
bark
thin
and
gummy
branches
rather
naked
tassels
leaves
and
cones
small
but
in
damp
rich
soil
it
grows
close
and
slender
and
reaches
a
height
at
times
of
nearly
a
hundred
feet
specimens
only
six
inches
in
diameter
at
the
ground
are
often
fifty
or
sixty
feet
in
height
as
slender
and
sharp
in
outline
as
arrows
like
the
true
tamarack
larch
of
the
eastern
states
hence
the
name
though
it
is
a
pine
the
don
has
gone
ahead
on
one
of
the
pack
animals
to
spy
out
the
land
to
the
north
of
yosemite
in
search
of
the
best
point
for
a
central
camp
much
higher
than
this
we
can
not
now
go
for
the
upper
pastures
said
to
be
better
than
any
hereabouts
are
still
buried
in
heavy
winter
snow
glad
i
am
that
camp
is
to
be
fixed
in
the
yosemite
region
for
many
a
glorious
ramble
i
have
along
the
top
of
the
walls
and
then
what
landscapes
i
shall
find
with
their
new
mountains
and
ca単ons
forests
and
gardens
lakes
and
streams
and
falls
we
are
now
about
seven
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
and
the
nights
are
so
cool
we
have
to
pile
coats
and
extra
clothing
on
top
of
our
blankets
tamarack
creek
is
icy
cold
delicious
exhilarating
champagne
water
it
is
flowing
in
the
meadow
with
silent
speed
but
only
a
few
hundred
yards
below
our
camp
the
ground
is
bare
gray
granite
strewn
with
boulders
large
spaces
being
without
a
single
tree
or
only
a
small
one
here
and
there
anchored
in
narrow
seams
and
cracks
the
boulders
many
of
them
very
large
are
not
in
piles
or
scattered
like
rubbish
among
loose
crumbling
d辿bris
as
if
weathered
out
of
the
solid
as
boulders
of
disintegration
they
mostly
occur
singly
and
are
lying
on
a
clean
pavement
on
which
the
sunshine
falls
in
a
glare
that
contrasts
with
the
shimmer
of
light
and
shade
we
have
been
accustomed
to
in
the
leafy
woods
and
strange
to
say
these
boulders
lying
so
still
and
deserted
with
no
moving
force
near
them
no
boulder
carrier
anywhere
in
sight
were
nevertheless
brought
from
a
distance
as
difference
in
color
and
composition
shows
quarried
and
carried
and
laid
down
here
each
in
its
place
nor
have
they
stirred
most
of
them
through
calm
and
storm
since
first
they
arrived
they
look
lonely
here
strangers
in
a
strange
land
huge
blocks
angular
mountain
chips
the
largest
twenty
or
thirty
feet
in
diameter
the
chips
that
nature
has
made
in
modeling
her
landscapes
fashioning
the
forms
of
her
mountains
and
valleys
and
with
what
tool
were
they
quarried
and
carried
on
the
pavement
we
find
its
marks
the
most
resisting
unweathered
portion
of
the
surface
is
scored
and
striated
in
a
rigidly
parallel
way
indicating
that
the
region
has
been
overswept
by
a
glacier
from
the
northeastward
grinding
down
the
general
mass
of
the
mountains
scoring
and
polishing
producing
a
strange
raw
wiped
appearance
and
dropping
whatever
boulders
it
chanced
to
be
carrying
at
the
time
it
was
melted
at
the
close
of
the
glacial
period
a
fine
discovery
this
as
for
the
forests
we
have
been
passing
through
they
are
probably
growing
on
deposits
of
soil
most
of
which
has
been
laid
down
by
this
same
ice
agent
in
the
form
of
moraines
of
different
sorts
now
in
great
part
disintegrated
and
outspread
by
weathering
out
of
the
grassy
meadow
and
down
over
this
granite
runs
the
glad
young
tamarack
creek
rejoicing
exulting
chanting
dancing
in
white
glowing
irised
falls
and
cascades
on
its
way
to
the
merced
ca単on
a
few
miles
below
yosemite
falling
more
than
three
thousand
feet
in
a
distance
of
about
two
miles
all
the
merced
streams
are
wonderful
singers
and
yosemite
is
the
centre
where
the
main
tributaries
meet
from
a
point
about
half
a
mile
from
our
camp
we
can
see
into
the
lower
end
of
the
famous
valley
with
its
wonderful
cliffs
and
groves
a
grand
page
of
mountain
manuscript
that
i
would
gladly
give
my
life
to
be
able
to
read
how
vast
it
seems
how
short
human
life
when
we
happen
to
think
of
it
and
how
little
we
may
learn
however
hard
we
try
yet
why
bewail
our
poor
inevitable
ignorance
some
of
the
external
beauty
is
always
in
sight
enough
to
keep
every
fibre
of
us
tingling
and
this
we
are
able
to
gloriously
enjoy
though
the
methods
of
its
creation
may
lie
beyond
our
ken
sing
on
brave
tamarack
creek
fresh
from
your
snowy
fountains
plash
and
swirl
and
dance
to
your
fate
in
the
sea
bathing
cheering
every
living
thing
along
your
way
have
greatly
enjoyed
all
this
huge
day
sauntering
and
seeing
steeping
in
the
mountain
influences
sketching
noting
pressing
flowers
drinking
ozone
and
tamarack
water
found
the
white
fragrant
washington
lily
the
finest
of
all
the
sierra
lilies
its
bulbs
are
buried
in
shaggy
chaparral
tangles
i
suppose
for
safety
from
pawing
bears
and
its
magnificent
panicles
sway
and
rock
over
the
top
of
the
rough
bushes
while
big
bold
bees
drone
and
mumble
in
its
polleny
bells
a
lovely
flower
worth
going
hungry
and
footsore
endless
miles
to
see
the
whole
world
seems
richer
now
that
i
have
found
this
plant
in
so
noble
a
landscape
a
log
house
serves
to
mark
a
claim
to
the
tamarack
meadow
which
may
become
valuable
as
a
station
in
case
travel
to
yosemite
should
greatly
increase
belated
parties
occasionally
stop
here
a
white
man
with
an
indian
woman
is
holding
possession
of
the
place
sauntered
up
the
meadow
about
sundown
out
of
sight
of
camp
and
sheep
and
all
human
mark
into
the
deep
peace
of
the
solemn
old
woods
everything
glowing
with
heaven
unquenchable
enthusiasm
the
don
has
returned
and
again
we
go
on
pilgrimage
looking
over
the
yosemite
creek
country
he
said
from
the
tops
of
the
hills
you
see
nothing
but
rocks
and
patches
of
trees
but
when
you
go
down
into
the
rocky
desert
you
find
no
end
of
small
grassy
banks
and
meadows
and
so
the
country
is
not
half
so
lean
as
it
looks
there
go
and
stay
until
the
snow
is
melted
from
the
upper
country
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
the
high
snow
made
a
stay
in
the
yosemite
region
necessary
for
i
am
anxious
to
see
as
much
of
it
as
possible
what
fine
times
i
shall
have
sketching
studying
plants
and
rocks
and
scrambling
about
the
brink
of
the
great
valley
alone
out
of
sight
and
sound
of
camp
we
saw
another
party
of
yosemite
tourists
somehow
most
of
these
travelers
seem
to
care
but
little
for
the
glorious
objects
about
them
though
enough
to
spend
time
and
money
and
endure
long
rides
to
see
the
famous
valley
and
when
they
are
fairly
within
the
mighty
walls
of
the
temple
and
hear
the
psalms
of
the
falls
they
will
forget
themselves
and
become
devout
blessed
indeed
should
be
every
pilgrim
in
these
holy
mountains
we
moved
slowly
eastward
along
the
mono
trail
and
early
in
the
afternoon
unpacked
and
camped
on
the
bank
of
cascade
creek
the
mono
trail
crosses
the
range
by
the
bloody
ca単on
pass
to
gold
mines
near
the
north
end
of
mono
lake
these
mines
were
reported
to
be
rich
when
first
discovered
and
a
grand
rush
took
place
making
a
trail
necessary
a
few
small
bridges
were
built
over
streams
where
fording
was
not
practicable
on
account
of
the
softness
of
the
bottom
sections
of
fallen
trees
cut
out
and
lanes
made
through
thickets
wide
enough
to
allow
the
passage
of
bulky
packs
but
over
the
greater
part
of
the
way
scarce
a
stone
or
shovelful
of
earth
has
been
moved
the
woods
we
passed
through
are
composed
almost
wholly
of
the
companion
species
being
mostly
left
behind
on
account
of
altitude
while
the
increasing
elevation
seems
grateful
to
the
charming
no
words
can
do
anything
like
justice
to
this
noble
tree
at
one
place
many
had
fallen
during
some
heavy
owing
to
the
loose
sandy
character
of
the
soil
which
offered
no
secure
anchorage
the
soil
is
mostly
decomposed
and
disintegrated
moraine
material
the
sheep
are
lying
down
on
a
bare
rocky
spot
such
as
they
like
chewing
the
cud
in
grassy
peace
cooking
is
going
on
appetites
growing
keener
every
day
no
lowlander
can
appreciate
the
mountain
appetite
and
the
facility
with
which
heavy
food
called
grub
is
disposed
of
eating
walking
resting
seem
alike
delightful
and
one
feels
inclined
to
shout
lustily
on
rising
in
the
morning
like
a
crowing
cock
sleep
and
digestion
as
clear
as
the
air
fine
spicy
plush
boughs
for
bedding
we
shall
have
and
a
glorious
lullaby
from
this
cascading
creek
never
was
stream
more
fittingly
named
for
as
far
as
i
have
traced
it
above
and
below
our
camp
it
is
one
continuous
bouncing
dancing
white
bloom
of
cascades
and
at
the
very
last
unwearied
it
finishes
its
wild
course
in
a
grand
leap
of
three
hundred
feet
or
more
to
the
bottom
of
the
main
yosemite
ca単on
near
the
fall
of
tamarack
creek
a
few
miles
below
the
foot
of
the
valley
these
falls
almost
rival
some
of
the
yosemite
falls
never
shall
i
forget
these
glad
cascade
songs
the
low
booming
the
roaring
the
keen
silvery
clashing
of
the
cool
water
rushing
exulting
from
form
to
form
beneath
irised
spray
or
in
the
deep
still
night
seen
white
in
the
darkness
and
its
multitude
of
voices
sounding
still
more
impressively
sublime
here
i
find
the
little
water
ouzel
as
much
at
home
as
any
linnet
in
a
leafy
grove
seeming
to
take
the
greater
delight
the
more
boisterous
the
stream
the
dizzy
precipices
the
swift
dashing
energy
displayed
and
the
thunder
tones
of
the
sheer
falls
are
awe
inspiring
but
there
is
nothing
awful
about
this
little
bird
its
song
is
sweet
and
low
and
all
its
gestures
as
it
flits
about
amid
the
loud
uproar
bespeak
strength
and
peace
and
joy
contemplating
these
darlings
of
nature
coming
forth
from
nests
on
the
brink
of
savage
streams
samson
riddle
comes
to
mind
out
of
the
strong
cometh
forth
sweetness
a
yet
finer
bloom
is
this
little
bird
than
the
in
eddying
pools
gentle
bird
a
precious
message
you
bring
me
we
may
miss
the
meaning
of
the
torrent
but
thy
sweet
voice
only
love
is
in
it
our
course
all
day
has
been
eastward
over
the
rim
of
yosemite
creek
basin
and
down
about
halfway
to
the
bottom
where
we
have
encamped
on
a
sheet
of
granite
a
firm
foundation
for
beds
saw
the
tracks
of
a
very
large
bear
on
the
trail
and
the
don
talked
of
bears
in
general
i
said
i
should
like
to
see
the
maker
of
these
immense
tracks
as
he
marched
along
and
follow
him
for
days
without
disturbing
him
to
learn
something
of
the
life
of
this
master
beast
of
the
wilderness
lambs
the
don
told
me
born
in
the
lowland
that
never
saw
or
heard
a
bear
snort
and
run
in
terror
when
they
catch
the
scent
showing
how
fully
they
have
inherited
a
knowledge
of
their
enemy
hogs
mules
horses
and
cattle
are
afraid
of
bears
and
are
seized
with
ungovernable
terror
when
they
approach
particularly
hogs
and
mules
hogs
are
frequently
driven
to
pastures
in
the
foothills
of
the
coast
range
and
sierra
where
acorns
are
abundant
and
are
herded
in
droves
of
hundreds
like
sheep
when
a
bear
comes
to
the
range
they
promptly
leave
it
emigrating
in
a
body
usually
in
the
night
time
the
keepers
being
powerless
to
prevent
they
thus
show
more
sense
than
sheep
that
simply
scatter
in
the
rocks
and
brush
and
await
their
fate
mules
flee
like
the
wind
with
or
without
riders
when
they
see
a
bear
and
if
picketed
sometimes
break
their
necks
in
trying
to
break
their
ropes
though
i
have
not
heard
of
bears
killing
mules
or
horses
of
hogs
they
are
said
to
be
particularly
fond
bolting
small
ones
bones
and
all
without
choice
of
parts
in
particular
delaney
assured
me
that
all
kinds
of
bears
in
the
sierra
are
very
shy
and
that
hunters
found
far
greater
difficulty
in
getting
within
gunshot
of
them
than
of
deer
or
indeed
any
other
animal
in
the
sierra
and
if
i
was
anxious
to
see
much
of
them
i
should
have
to
wait
and
watch
with
endless
indian
patience
and
pay
no
attention
to
anything
else
night
is
coming
on
the
gray
rock
waves
are
growing
dim
in
the
twilight
how
raw
and
young
this
region
appears
had
the
ice
sheet
that
swept
over
it
vanished
but
yesterday
its
traces
on
the
more
resisting
portions
about
our
camp
could
hardly
be
more
distinct
than
they
now
are
the
horses
and
sheep
and
all
of
us
indeed
slipped
on
the
smoothest
places
how
deathlike
is
sleep
in
this
mountain
air
and
quick
the
awakening
into
newness
of
life
a
calm
dawn
yellow
and
purple
then
floods
of
making
every
thing
tingle
and
glow
in
an
hour
or
two
we
came
to
yosemite
creek
the
stream
that
makes
the
greatest
of
all
the
yosemite
falls
it
is
about
forty
feet
wide
at
the
mono
trail
crossing
and
now
about
four
feet
in
average
depth
flowing
about
three
miles
an
hour
the
distance
to
the
verge
of
the
yosemite
wall
where
it
makes
its
tremendous
plunge
is
only
about
two
miles
from
here
calm
beautiful
and
nearly
silent
it
glides
with
stately
gestures
a
dense
growth
of
the
slender
pine
along
its
banks
and
a
fringe
of
willow
purple
spirea
sedges
daisies
lilies
and
columbines
some
of
the
sedges
and
willow
boughs
dip
into
the
current
and
just
outside
of
the
close
ranks
of
trees
there
is
a
sunny
flat
of
washed
gravelly
sand
which
seems
to
have
been
deposited
by
some
ancient
flood
it
is
covered
with
millions
of
erethrea
eriogonum
and
oxytheca
with
more
flowers
than
leaves
forming
an
even
growth
slightly
dimpled
and
ruffled
here
and
there
by
rosettes
of
back
of
this
flowery
strip
there
is
a
wavy
upsloping
plain
of
solid
granite
so
smoothly
in
many
places
that
it
glistens
in
the
sun
like
glass
in
shallow
hollows
there
are
patches
of
trees
mostly
the
rough
form
of
the
pine
rather
scrawny
looking
where
there
is
little
or
no
soil
also
a
few
junipers
short
and
stout
with
bright
bark
and
gray
foliage
standing
alone
mostly
on
the
pavement
safe
from
fire
clinging
by
slight
joints
a
sturdy
mountaineer
of
a
tree
living
on
sunshine
and
snow
maintaining
tough
health
on
this
diet
for
perhaps
more
than
a
thousand
years
up
towards
the
head
of
the
basin
i
see
groups
of
domes
rising
above
the
wavelike
ridges
and
some
picturesque
castellated
masses
and
dark
strips
and
patches
of
silver
fir
indicating
deposits
of
fertile
soil
would
that
i
could
command
the
time
to
study
them
what
rich
excursions
one
could
make
in
this
basin
its
glacial
inscriptions
and
sculptures
how
marvelous
they
seem
how
noble
the
studies
they
offer
i
tremble
with
excitement
in
the
dawn
of
these
glorious
mountain
sublimities
but
i
can
only
gaze
and
wonder
and
like
a
child
gather
here
and
there
a
lily
half
hoping
i
may
be
able
to
study
and
learn
in
years
to
come
the
drivers
and
dogs
had
a
lively
laborious
time
getting
the
sheep
across
the
creek
the
second
large
stream
thus
far
that
they
have
been
compelled
to
cross
without
a
bridge
the
first
being
the
north
fork
of
the
merced
near
bower
cave
men
and
dogs
shouting
and
barking
drove
the
timid
creatures
in
a
close
crowd
against
the
bank
but
not
one
of
the
flock
would
launch
away
while
thus
jammed
the
don
and
the
shepherd
rushed
through
the
frightened
crowd
to
stampede
those
in
front
but
this
would
only
cause
a
break
backward
and
away
they
would
scamper
through
the
trees
and
scatter
over
the
rocky
pavement
then
with
the
aid
of
the
dogs
the
runaways
would
again
be
gathered
and
made
to
face
the
stream
and
again
the
compacted
mass
would
break
away
amid
wild
shouting
and
barking
that
might
well
have
disturbed
the
stream
itself
and
marred
the
music
of
its
falls
to
which
visitors
no
doubt
from
all
quarters
of
the
globe
were
listening
hold
them
there
now
hold
them
there
shouted
the
don
the
front
ranks
will
soon
tire
of
the
pressure
and
be
glad
to
take
to
the
water
then
all
will
jump
in
and
cross
in
a
hurry
but
they
did
nothing
of
the
kind
they
only
avoided
the
pressure
by
breaking
back
in
scores
and
hundreds
leaving
the
beauty
of
the
banks
sadly
trampled
if
only
one
could
be
got
to
cross
over
all
would
make
haste
to
follow
but
that
one
could
not
be
found
a
lamb
was
caught
carried
across
and
tied
to
a
bush
on
the
opposite
bank
where
it
cried
piteously
for
its
mother
but
though
greatly
concerned
the
mother
only
called
it
back
that
play
on
maternal
affection
failed
and
we
began
to
fear
that
we
should
be
forced
to
make
a
long
roundabout
drive
and
cross
the
tributaries
of
the
creek
in
succession
this
would
require
several
days
but
it
had
its
advantages
for
i
was
eager
to
see
the
sources
of
so
famous
a
stream
don
quixote
however
determined
that
they
must
ford
just
here
and
immediately
began
a
sort
of
siege
by
cutting
down
slender
pines
on
the
bank
and
building
a
corral
barely
large
enough
to
hold
the
flock
when
well
pressed
together
and
as
the
stream
would
form
one
side
of
the
corral
he
believed
that
they
could
easily
be
forced
into
the
water
in
a
few
hours
the
inclosure
was
completed
and
the
silly
animals
were
driven
in
and
rammed
hard
against
the
brink
of
the
ford
then
the
don
forcing
a
way
through
the
compacted
mass
pitched
a
few
of
the
terrified
unfortunates
into
the
stream
by
main
strength
but
instead
of
crossing
over
they
swam
about
close
to
the
bank
making
desperate
attempts
to
get
back
into
the
flock
then
a
dozen
or
more
were
shoved
off
and
the
don
tall
like
a
crane
and
a
good
natural
wader
jumped
in
after
them
seized
a
struggling
wether
and
dragged
it
to
the
opposite
shore
but
no
sooner
did
he
let
it
go
than
it
jumped
into
the
stream
and
swam
back
to
its
frightened
companions
in
the
corral
thus
manifesting
as
unchangeable
as
gravitation
pan
with
his
pipes
would
have
had
no
better
luck
i
fear
we
were
now
pretty
well
baffled
the
silly
creatures
would
suffer
any
sort
of
death
rather
than
cross
that
stream
calling
a
council
the
dripping
don
declared
that
starvation
was
now
the
only
likely
scheme
to
try
and
that
we
might
as
well
camp
here
in
comfort
and
let
the
besieged
flock
grow
hungry
and
cool
and
come
to
their
senses
if
they
had
any
in
a
few
minutes
after
being
thus
let
alone
an
adventurer
in
the
foremost
rank
plunged
in
and
swam
bravely
to
the
farther
shore
then
suddenly
all
rushed
in
together
trampling
one
another
under
water
while
we
vainly
tried
to
hold
them
back
the
don
jumped
into
the
thickest
of
the
gasping
gurgling
drowning
mass
and
shoved
them
right
and
left
as
if
each
sheep
was
a
piece
of
floating
timber
the
current
also
served
to
drift
them
apart
a
long
bent
column
was
soon
formed
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
were
over
and
began
baaing
and
feeding
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
common
had
happened
that
none
were
drowned
seems
wonderful
i
fully
expected
that
hundreds
would
gain
the
romantic
fate
of
being
swept
into
yosemite
over
the
highest
waterfall
in
the
world
as
the
day
was
far
spent
we
camped
a
little
way
back
from
the
ford
and
let
the
dripping
flock
scatter
and
feed
until
sundown
the
wool
is
dry
now
and
calm
peace
has
fallen
on
all
the
comfortable
band
leaving
no
trace
of
the
watery
battle
i
have
seen
fish
driven
out
of
the
water
with
less
ado
than
was
made
in
driving
these
animals
into
it
sheep
brain
must
surely
be
poor
stuff
compare
today
exhibition
with
the
performances
of
deer
swimming
quietly
across
broad
and
rapid
rivers
and
from
island
to
island
in
seas
and
lakes
or
with
dogs
or
even
with
the
squirrels
that
as
the
story
goes
cross
the
mississippi
river
on
selected
chips
with
tails
for
sails
comfortably
trimmed
to
the
breeze
a
sheep
can
hardly
be
called
an
animal
an
entire
flock
is
required
to
make
one
foolish
individual
chapter
v
the
yosemite
followed
the
mono
trail
up
the
eastern
rim
of
the
basin
nearly
to
its
summit
then
turned
off
southward
to
a
small
shallow
valley
that
extends
to
the
edge
of
the
yosemite
which
we
reached
about
noon
and
encamped
after
luncheon
i
made
haste
to
high
ground
and
from
the
top
of
the
ridge
on
the
west
side
of
indian
ca単on
gained
the
noblest
view
of
the
summit
peaks
i
have
ever
yet
enjoyed
nearly
all
the
upper
basin
of
the
merced
was
displayed
with
its
sublime
domes
and
ca単ons
dark
upsweeping
forests
and
glorious
array
of
white
peaks
deep
in
the
sky
every
feature
glowing
radiating
beauty
that
pours
into
our
flesh
and
bones
like
heat
rays
from
fire
sunshine
over
all
no
breath
of
wind
to
stir
the
brooding
calm
never
before
had
i
seen
so
glorious
a
landscape
so
boundless
an
affluence
of
sublime
mountain
beauty
the
most
extravagant
description
i
might
give
of
this
view
to
any
one
who
has
not
seen
similar
landscapes
with
his
own
eyes
would
not
so
much
as
hint
its
grandeur
and
the
spiritual
glow
that
covered
it
i
shouted
and
gesticulated
in
a
wild
burst
of
ecstasy
much
to
the
astonishment
of
bernard
carlo
who
came
running
up
to
me
manifesting
in
his
intelligent
eyes
a
puzzled
concern
that
was
very
ludicrous
which
had
the
effect
of
bringing
me
to
my
senses
a
brown
bear
too
it
would
seem
had
been
a
spectator
of
the
show
i
had
made
of
myself
for
i
had
gone
but
a
few
yards
when
i
started
one
from
a
thicket
of
brush
he
evidently
considered
me
dangerous
for
he
ran
away
very
fast
tumbling
over
the
tops
of
the
tangled
manzanita
bushes
in
his
haste
carlo
drew
back
with
his
ears
depressed
as
if
afraid
and
kept
looking
me
in
the
face
as
if
expecting
me
to
pursue
and
shoot
for
he
had
seen
many
a
bear
battle
in
his
day
following
the
ridge
which
made
a
gradual
descent
to
the
south
i
came
at
length
to
the
brow
of
that
massive
cliff
that
stands
between
indian
ca単on
and
yosemite
falls
and
here
the
valley
came
suddenly
into
view
throughout
almost
its
whole
extent
the
noble
walls
sculptured
into
endless
variety
of
domes
and
gables
spires
and
battlements
and
plain
mural
precipices
all
with
the
thunder
tones
of
the
falling
water
the
level
bottom
seemed
to
be
dressed
like
a
garden
sunny
meadows
here
and
there
and
groves
of
pine
and
oak
the
river
of
mercy
sweeping
in
majesty
through
the
midst
of
them
and
flashing
back
the
sunbeams
the
great
tissiack
or
rising
at
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
to
a
height
of
nearly
a
mile
is
nobly
proportioned
and
the
most
impressive
of
all
the
rocks
holding
the
eye
in
devout
admiration
calling
it
back
again
and
again
from
falls
or
meadows
or
even
the
mountains
beyond
marvelous
cliffs
marvelous
in
sheer
dizzy
depth
and
sculpture
types
of
endurance
thousands
of
years
have
they
stood
in
the
sky
exposed
to
rain
snow
frost
earthquake
and
avalanche
yet
they
still
wear
the
bloom
of
youth
i
rambled
along
the
valley
rim
to
the
westward
most
of
it
is
rounded
off
on
the
very
brink
so
that
it
is
not
easy
to
find
places
where
one
may
look
clear
down
the
face
of
the
wall
to
the
bottom
when
such
places
were
found
and
i
had
cautiously
set
my
feet
and
drawn
my
body
erect
i
could
not
help
fearing
a
little
that
the
rock
might
split
off
and
let
me
down
and
what
a
down
more
than
three
thousand
feet
still
my
limbs
did
not
tremble
nor
did
i
feel
the
least
uncertainty
as
to
the
reliance
to
be
placed
on
them
my
only
fear
was
that
a
flake
of
the
granite
which
in
some
places
showed
joints
more
or
less
open
and
running
parallel
with
the
face
of
the
cliff
might
give
way
after
withdrawing
from
such
places
excited
with
the
view
i
had
got
i
would
say
to
myself
now
do
go
out
on
the
verge
again
but
in
the
face
of
yosemite
scenery
cautious
remonstrance
is
vain
under
its
spell
body
seems
to
go
where
it
likes
with
a
will
over
which
we
seem
to
have
scarce
any
control
after
a
mile
or
so
of
this
memorable
cliff
work
i
approached
yosemite
creek
admiring
its
easy
graceful
confident
gestures
as
it
comes
bravely
forward
in
its
narrow
channel
singing
the
last
of
its
mountain
songs
on
its
way
to
its
fate
a
few
rods
more
over
the
shining
granite
then
down
half
a
mile
in
showy
foam
to
another
world
to
be
lost
in
the
merced
where
climate
vegetation
inhabitants
all
are
different
emerging
from
its
last
gorge
it
glides
in
wide
rapids
down
a
smooth
incline
into
a
pool
where
it
seems
to
rest
and
compose
its
gray
agitated
waters
before
taking
the
grand
plunge
then
slowly
slipping
over
the
lip
of
the
pool
basin
it
descends
another
glossy
slope
with
rapidly
accelerated
speed
to
the
brink
of
the
tremendous
cliff
and
with
sublime
fateful
confidence
springs
out
free
in
the
air
i
took
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
and
worked
my
way
cautiously
down
alongside
the
rushing
flood
keeping
my
feet
and
hands
pressed
firmly
on
the
polished
rock
the
booming
roaring
water
rushing
past
close
to
my
head
was
very
exciting
i
had
expected
that
the
sloping
apron
would
terminate
with
the
perpendicular
wall
of
the
valley
and
that
from
the
foot
of
it
where
it
is
less
steeply
inclined
i
should
be
able
to
lean
far
enough
out
to
see
the
forms
and
behavior
of
the
fall
all
the
way
down
to
the
bottom
but
i
found
that
there
was
yet
another
small
brow
over
which
i
could
not
see
and
which
appeared
to
be
too
steep
for
mortal
feet
scanning
it
keenly
i
discovered
a
narrow
shelf
about
three
inches
wide
on
the
very
brink
just
wide
enough
for
a
rest
for
heels
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
of
reaching
it
over
so
steep
a
brow
at
length
after
careful
scrutiny
of
the
surface
i
found
an
irregular
edge
of
a
flake
of
the
rock
some
distance
back
from
the
margin
of
the
torrent
if
i
was
to
get
down
to
the
brink
at
all
that
rough
edge
which
might
offer
slight
was
the
only
way
but
the
slope
beside
it
looked
dangerously
smooth
and
steep
and
the
swift
roaring
flood
beneath
overhead
and
beside
me
was
very
i
therefore
concluded
not
to
venture
farther
but
did
nevertheless
tufts
of
artemisia
were
growing
in
clefts
of
the
rock
near
by
and
i
filled
my
mouth
with
the
bitter
leaves
hoping
they
might
help
to
prevent
giddiness
then
with
a
caution
not
known
in
ordinary
circumstances
i
crept
down
safely
to
the
little
ledge
got
my
heels
well
planted
on
it
then
shuffled
in
a
horizontal
direction
twenty
or
thirty
feet
until
close
to
the
outplunging
current
which
by
the
time
it
had
descended
thus
far
was
already
white
here
i
obtained
a
perfectly
free
view
down
into
the
heart
of
the
snowy
chanting
throng
of
streamers
into
which
the
body
of
the
fall
soon
separates
while
perched
on
that
narrow
niche
i
was
not
distinctly
conscious
of
danger
the
tremendous
grandeur
of
the
fall
in
form
and
sound
and
motion
acting
at
close
range
smothered
the
sense
of
fear
and
in
such
places
one
body
takes
keen
care
for
safety
on
its
own
account
how
long
i
remained
down
there
or
how
i
returned
i
can
hardly
tell
anyhow
i
had
a
glorious
time
and
got
back
to
camp
about
dark
enjoying
triumphant
exhilaration
soon
followed
by
dull
weariness
hereafter
try
to
keep
from
such
extravagant
places
yet
such
a
day
is
well
worth
venturing
for
my
first
view
of
the
high
sierra
first
view
looking
down
into
yosemite
the
death
song
of
yosemite
creek
and
its
flight
over
the
vast
cliff
each
one
of
these
is
of
itself
enough
for
a
great
landscape
fortune
a
most
memorable
day
of
days
enjoyment
enough
to
kill
if
that
were
possible
my
enjoyments
yesterday
afternoon
especially
at
the
head
of
the
fall
were
too
great
for
good
sleep
kept
starting
up
last
night
in
a
nervous
tremor
half
awake
fancying
that
the
foundation
of
the
mountain
we
were
camped
on
had
given
way
and
was
falling
into
yosemite
valley
in
vain
i
roused
myself
to
make
a
new
beginning
for
sound
sleep
the
nerve
strain
had
been
too
great
and
again
and
again
i
dreamed
i
was
rushing
through
the
air
above
a
glorious
avalanche
of
water
and
rocks
one
time
springing
to
my
feet
i
said
this
time
it
is
real
all
must
die
and
where
could
mountaineer
find
a
more
glorious
death
left
camp
soon
after
sunrise
for
an
ramble
eastward
crossed
the
head
of
indian
basin
forested
with
underbrush
mostly
and
manzanita
a
mixture
not
easily
trampled
over
or
penetrated
for
the
ceanothus
is
thorny
and
grows
in
dense
masses
and
the
manzanita
has
exceedingly
crooked
stubborn
branches
from
the
head
of
the
ca単on
continued
on
past
north
dome
into
the
basin
of
dome
or
porcupine
creek
here
are
many
fine
meadows
imbedded
in
the
woods
gay
with
and
its
companions
the
elevation
about
eight
thousand
feet
seems
to
be
best
suited
for
it
saw
specimens
that
were
a
foot
or
two
higher
than
my
head
had
more
magnificent
views
of
the
upper
mountains
and
of
the
great
south
dome
said
to
be
the
grandest
rock
in
the
world
well
it
may
be
since
it
is
of
such
noble
dimensions
and
sculpture
a
wonderfully
impressive
monument
its
lines
exquisite
in
fineness
and
though
sublime
in
size
is
finished
like
the
finest
work
of
art
and
seems
to
be
alive
a
new
camp
was
made
in
a
magnificent
silver
fir
grove
at
the
head
of
a
small
stream
that
flows
into
yosemite
by
way
of
indian
ca単on
here
we
intend
to
stay
several
weeks
a
fine
location
from
which
to
make
excursions
about
the
great
valley
and
its
fountains
glorious
days
i
have
sketching
pressing
plants
studying
the
wonderful
topography
and
the
wild
animals
our
happy
fellow
mortals
and
neighbors
but
the
vast
mountains
in
the
distance
shall
i
ever
know
them
shall
i
be
allowed
to
enter
into
their
midst
and
dwell
with
them
illustration
north
and
south
we
were
pelted
about
noon
by
a
short
heavy
rainstorm
sublime
thunder
reverberating
among
the
mountains
and
ca単ons
some
strokes
near
crashing
ringing
in
the
tense
crisp
air
with
startling
keenness
while
the
distant
peaks
loomed
gloriously
through
the
cloud
fringes
and
sheets
of
rain
now
the
storm
is
past
and
the
fresh
washed
air
is
full
of
the
essences
of
the
flower
gardens
and
groves
winter
storms
in
yosemite
must
be
glorious
may
i
see
them
have
got
my
bed
made
in
our
new
camp
plushy
sumptuous
and
deliciously
fragrant
most
of
it
fir
plumes
of
course
with
a
variety
of
sweet
flowers
in
the
pillow
hope
to
sleep
without
tottering
watched
a
deer
eating
ceanothus
leaves
and
twigs
slept
pretty
well
the
valley
walls
did
not
seem
to
fall
though
i
still
fancied
myself
at
the
brink
alongside
the
white
plunging
flood
especially
when
half
asleep
strange
the
danger
of
that
adventure
should
be
more
troublesome
now
that
i
am
in
the
bosom
of
the
peaceful
woods
a
mile
or
more
from
the
fall
than
it
was
while
i
was
on
the
brink
of
it
bears
seem
to
be
common
here
judging
by
their
tracks
about
noon
we
had
another
rainstorm
with
keen
startling
thunder
the
metallic
ringing
clashing
clanging
notes
gradually
fading
into
low
bass
rolling
and
muttering
in
the
distance
for
a
few
minutes
the
rain
came
in
a
grand
torrent
like
a
waterfall
then
hail
some
of
the
hailstones
an
inch
in
diameter
hard
icy
and
irregular
in
form
like
those
oftentimes
seen
in
wisconsin
carlo
watched
them
with
intelligent
astonishment
as
they
came
pelting
and
thrashing
through
the
quivering
branches
of
the
trees
the
cloud
scenery
sublime
afternoon
calm
sunful
and
clear
with
delicious
freshness
and
fragrance
from
the
firs
and
flowers
and
steaming
ground
watching
the
daybreak
and
sunrise
the
pale
rose
and
purple
sky
changing
softly
to
daffodil
yellow
and
white
sunbeams
pouring
through
the
passes
between
the
peaks
and
over
the
yosemite
domes
making
their
edges
burn
the
silver
firs
in
the
middle
ground
catching
the
glow
on
their
spiry
tops
and
our
camp
grove
fills
and
thrills
with
the
glorious
light
everything
awakening
alert
and
joyful
the
birds
begin
to
stir
and
innumerable
insect
people
deer
quietly
withdraw
into
leafy
in
the
chaparral
the
dew
vanishes
flowers
spread
their
petals
every
pulse
beats
high
every
life
cell
rejoices
the
very
rocks
seem
to
thrill
with
life
the
whole
landscape
glows
like
a
human
face
in
a
glory
of
enthusiasm
and
the
blue
sky
pale
around
the
horizon
bends
peacefully
down
over
all
like
one
vast
flower
about
noon
as
usual
big
bossy
cumuli
began
to
grow
above
the
forest
and
the
rainstorm
pouring
from
them
is
the
most
imposing
i
have
yet
seen
the
silvery
zigzag
lightning
lances
are
longer
than
usual
and
the
thunder
gloriously
impressive
keen
crashing
intensely
concentrated
speaking
with
such
tremendous
energy
it
would
seem
that
an
entire
mountain
is
being
shattered
at
every
stroke
but
probably
only
a
few
trees
are
being
shattered
many
of
which
i
have
seen
on
my
walks
hereabouts
strewing
the
ground
at
last
the
clear
ringing
strokes
are
succeeded
by
deep
low
tones
that
grow
gradually
fainter
as
they
roll
afar
into
the
recesses
of
the
echoing
mountains
where
they
seem
to
be
welcomed
home
then
another
and
another
peal
or
rather
crashing
splintering
stroke
follows
in
quick
succession
perchance
splitting
some
giant
pine
or
fir
from
top
to
bottom
into
long
rails
and
slivers
and
scattering
them
to
all
points
of
the
compass
now
comes
the
rain
with
corresponding
extravagant
grandeur
covering
the
ground
high
and
low
with
a
sheet
of
flowing
water
a
transparent
film
fitted
like
a
skin
upon
the
rugged
anatomy
of
the
landscape
making
the
rocks
glitter
and
glow
gathering
in
the
ravines
flooding
the
streams
and
making
them
shout
and
boom
in
reply
to
the
thunder
how
interesting
to
trace
the
history
of
a
single
raindrop
it
is
not
long
geologically
speaking
as
we
have
seen
since
the
first
raindrops
fell
on
the
newborn
leafless
sierra
landscapes
how
different
the
lot
of
these
falling
now
happy
the
showers
that
fall
on
so
fair
a
wilderness
scarce
a
single
drop
can
fail
to
find
a
beautiful
spot
on
the
tops
of
the
peaks
on
the
shining
glacier
pavements
on
the
great
smooth
domes
on
forests
and
gardens
and
brushy
moraines
plashing
glinting
pattering
laving
some
go
to
the
high
snowy
fountains
to
swell
their
stores
some
into
the
lakes
washing
the
mountain
windows
patting
their
smooth
glassy
levels
making
dimples
and
bubbles
and
spray
some
into
the
waterfalls
and
cascades
as
if
eager
to
join
in
their
dance
and
song
and
beat
their
foam
yet
finer
good
luck
and
good
work
for
the
happy
mountain
raindrops
each
one
of
them
a
high
waterfall
in
itself
descending
from
the
cliffs
and
hollows
of
the
clouds
to
the
cliffs
and
hollows
of
the
rocks
out
of
the
into
the
thunder
of
the
falling
rivers
some
falling
on
meadows
and
bogs
creep
silently
out
of
sight
to
the
grass
roots
hiding
softly
as
in
a
nest
slipping
oozing
hither
thither
seeking
and
finding
their
appointed
work
some
descending
through
the
spires
of
the
woods
sift
spray
through
the
shining
needles
whispering
peace
and
good
cheer
to
each
one
of
them
some
drops
with
happy
aim
glint
on
the
sides
of
crystals
quartz
hornblende
garnet
zircon
tourmaline
feldspar
patter
on
grains
of
gold
and
heavy
nuggets
some
with
blunt
and
low
bass
drumming
fall
on
the
broad
leaves
of
veratrum
saxifrage
cypripedium
some
happy
drops
fall
straight
into
the
cups
of
flowers
kissing
the
lips
of
lilies
how
far
they
have
to
go
how
many
cups
to
fill
great
and
small
cells
too
small
to
be
seen
cups
holding
half
a
drop
as
well
as
lake
basins
between
the
hills
each
replenished
with
equal
care
every
drop
in
all
the
blessed
throng
a
silvery
newborn
star
with
lake
and
river
garden
and
grove
valley
and
mountain
all
that
the
landscape
holds
reflected
in
its
crystal
depths
god
messenger
angel
of
love
sent
on
its
way
with
majesty
and
pomp
and
display
of
power
that
make
man
greatest
shows
ridiculous
now
the
storm
is
over
the
sky
is
clear
the
last
rolling
is
spent
on
the
peaks
and
where
are
the
raindrops
now
what
has
become
of
all
the
shining
throng
in
winged
vapor
rising
some
are
already
hastening
back
to
the
sky
some
have
gone
into
the
plants
creeping
through
invisible
doors
into
the
round
rooms
of
cells
some
are
locked
in
crystals
of
ice
some
in
rock
crystals
some
in
porous
moraines
to
keep
their
small
springs
flowing
some
have
gone
journeying
on
in
the
rivers
to
join
the
larger
raindrop
of
the
ocean
from
form
to
form
beauty
to
beauty
ever
changing
never
resting
all
are
speeding
on
with
love
enthusiasm
singing
with
the
stars
the
eternal
song
of
creation
fine
calm
morning
air
tense
and
clear
not
the
slightest
breeze
astir
everything
shining
the
rocks
with
wet
crystals
the
plants
with
dew
each
receiving
its
portion
of
irised
dewdrops
and
sunshine
like
living
creatures
getting
their
breakfast
their
dew
manna
coming
down
from
the
starry
sky
like
swarms
of
smaller
stars
how
wondrous
fine
are
the
particles
in
showers
of
dew
thousands
required
for
a
single
drop
growing
in
the
dark
as
silently
as
the
grass
what
pains
are
taken
to
keep
this
wilderness
in
health
showers
of
snow
showers
of
rain
showers
of
dew
floods
of
light
floods
of
invisible
vapor
clouds
winds
all
sorts
of
weather
interaction
of
plant
on
plant
animal
on
animal
beyond
thought
how
fine
methods
how
deeply
with
beauty
is
beauty
overlaid
the
ground
covered
with
crystals
the
crystals
with
mosses
and
lichens
and
grasses
and
flowers
these
with
larger
plants
leaf
over
leaf
with
color
and
form
the
broad
palms
of
the
firs
outspread
over
these
the
azure
dome
over
all
like
a
and
star
above
star
yonder
stands
the
south
dome
its
crown
high
above
our
camp
though
its
base
is
four
thousand
feet
below
us
a
most
noble
rock
it
seems
full
of
thought
clothed
with
living
light
no
sense
of
dead
stone
about
it
all
spiritualized
neither
heavy
looking
nor
light
steadfast
in
serene
strength
like
a
god
our
shepherd
is
a
queer
character
and
hard
to
place
in
this
wilderness
his
bed
is
a
hollow
made
in
red
punky
dust
beside
a
log
which
forms
a
portion
of
the
south
wall
of
the
corral
here
he
lies
with
his
wonderful
everlasting
clothing
on
wrapped
in
a
red
blanket
breathing
not
only
the
dust
of
the
decayed
wood
but
also
that
of
the
corral
as
if
determined
to
take
ammoniacal
snuff
all
night
after
chewing
tobacco
all
day
following
the
sheep
he
carries
a
heavy
swung
from
his
belt
on
one
side
and
his
luncheon
on
the
other
the
ancient
cloth
in
which
the
meat
fresh
from
the
is
tied
serves
as
a
filter
through
which
the
clear
fat
and
gravy
juices
drip
down
on
his
right
hip
and
leg
in
clustering
stalactites
this
oleaginous
formation
is
soon
broken
up
however
and
diffused
and
rubbed
evenly
into
his
scanty
apparel
by
sitting
down
rolling
over
crossing
his
legs
while
resting
on
logs
making
shirt
and
trousers
and
shiny
his
trousers
in
particular
have
become
so
adhesive
with
the
mixed
fat
and
resin
that
pine
needles
thin
flakes
and
fibres
of
bark
hair
mica
scales
and
minute
grains
of
quartz
hornblende
feathers
seed
wings
moth
and
butterfly
wings
legs
and
antenn脱
of
innumerable
insects
or
even
whole
insects
such
as
the
small
beetles
moths
and
mosquitoes
with
flower
petals
pollen
dust
and
indeed
bits
of
all
plants
animals
and
minerals
of
the
region
adhere
to
them
and
are
safely
imbedded
so
that
though
far
from
being
a
naturalist
he
collects
fragmentary
specimens
of
everything
and
becomes
richer
than
he
knows
his
specimens
are
kept
passably
fresh
too
by
the
purity
of
the
air
and
the
resiny
bituminous
beds
into
which
they
are
pressed
man
is
a
microcosm
at
least
our
shepherd
is
or
rather
his
trousers
these
precious
overalls
are
never
taken
off
and
nobody
knows
how
old
they
are
though
one
may
guess
by
their
thickness
and
concentric
structure
instead
of
wearing
thin
they
wear
thick
and
in
their
stratification
have
no
small
geological
significance
besides
herding
the
sheep
billy
is
the
butcher
while
i
have
agreed
to
wash
the
few
iron
and
tin
utensils
and
make
the
bread
then
these
small
duties
done
by
the
time
the
sun
is
fairly
above
the
i
am
beyond
the
flock
free
to
rove
and
revel
in
the
wilderness
all
the
big
immortal
days
sketching
on
the
north
dome
it
commands
views
of
nearly
all
the
valley
besides
a
few
of
the
high
mountains
i
would
fain
draw
everything
in
sight
rock
tree
and
leaf
but
little
can
i
do
beyond
mere
outlines
marks
with
meanings
like
words
readable
only
to
myself
yet
i
sharpen
my
pencils
and
work
on
as
if
others
might
possibly
be
benefited
whether
these
are
to
vanish
like
fallen
leaves
or
go
to
friends
like
letters
matters
not
much
for
little
can
they
tell
to
those
who
have
not
themselves
seen
similar
wildness
and
like
a
language
have
learned
it
no
pain
here
no
dull
empty
hours
no
fear
of
the
past
no
fear
of
the
future
these
blessed
mountains
are
so
compactly
filled
with
god
beauty
no
petty
personal
hope
or
experience
has
room
to
be
drinking
this
champagne
water
is
pure
pleasure
so
is
breathing
the
living
air
and
every
movement
of
limbs
is
pleasure
while
the
whole
body
seems
to
feel
beauty
when
exposed
to
it
as
it
feels
the
or
sunshine
entering
not
by
the
eyes
alone
but
equally
through
all
one
flesh
like
radiant
heat
making
a
passionate
ecstatic
not
explainable
one
body
then
seems
homogeneous
throughout
sound
as
a
crystal
perched
like
a
fly
on
this
yosemite
dome
i
gaze
and
sketch
and
bask
oftentimes
settling
down
into
dumb
admiration
without
definite
hope
of
ever
learning
much
yet
with
the
longing
unresting
effort
that
lies
at
the
door
of
hope
humbly
prostrate
before
the
vast
display
of
god
power
and
eager
to
offer
and
renunciation
with
eternal
toil
to
learn
any
lesson
in
the
divine
manuscript
it
is
easier
to
feel
than
to
realize
or
in
any
way
explain
yosemite
grandeur
the
magnitudes
of
the
rocks
and
trees
and
streams
are
so
delicately
harmonized
they
are
mostly
hidden
sheer
precipices
three
thousand
feet
high
are
fringed
with
tall
trees
growing
close
like
grass
on
the
brow
of
a
lowland
hill
and
extending
along
the
feet
of
these
precipices
a
ribbon
of
meadow
a
mile
wide
and
seven
or
eight
long
that
seems
like
a
strip
a
farmer
might
mow
in
less
than
a
day
waterfalls
five
hundred
to
one
or
two
thousand
feet
high
are
so
subordinated
to
the
mighty
cliffs
over
which
they
pour
that
they
seem
like
wisps
of
smoke
gentle
as
floating
clouds
though
their
voices
fill
the
valley
and
make
the
rocks
tremble
the
mountains
too
along
the
eastern
sky
and
the
domes
in
front
of
them
and
the
succession
of
smooth
rounded
waves
between
swelling
higher
higher
with
dark
woods
in
their
hollows
serene
in
massive
exuberant
bulk
and
beauty
tend
yet
more
to
hide
the
grandeur
of
the
yosemite
temple
and
make
it
appear
as
a
subdued
subordinate
feature
of
the
vast
harmonious
landscape
thus
every
attempt
to
appreciate
any
one
feature
is
beaten
down
by
the
overwhelming
influence
of
all
the
others
and
as
if
this
were
not
enough
lo
in
the
sky
arises
another
mountain
range
with
topography
as
rugged
and
as
the
one
beneath
it
snowy
peaks
and
domes
and
shadowy
yosemite
valleys
another
version
of
the
snowy
sierra
a
new
creation
heralded
by
a
how
fiercely
devoutly
wild
is
nature
in
the
midst
of
her
tenderness
painting
lilies
watering
them
caressing
them
with
gentle
hand
going
from
flower
to
flower
like
a
gardener
while
building
rock
mountains
and
cloud
mountains
full
of
lightning
and
rain
gladly
we
run
for
shelter
beneath
an
overhanging
cliff
and
examine
the
reassuring
ferns
and
mosses
gentle
love
tokens
growing
in
cracks
and
chinks
daisies
too
and
ivesias
confiding
wild
children
of
light
too
small
to
fear
to
these
heart
goes
home
and
the
voices
of
the
storm
become
gentle
now
the
sun
breaks
forth
and
fragrant
steam
arises
the
birds
are
out
singing
on
the
edges
of
the
groves
the
west
is
flaming
in
gold
and
purple
ready
for
the
ceremony
of
the
sunset
and
back
i
go
to
camp
with
my
notes
and
pictures
the
best
of
them
printed
in
my
mind
as
dreams
a
fruitful
day
without
measured
beginning
or
ending
a
terrestrial
eternity
a
gift
of
good
god
wrote
to
my
mother
and
a
few
friends
mountain
hints
to
each
they
seem
as
near

and
the
nearer

to
carlo
a
look
at
the
sky
lilies
and
death
sleep
until
the
dawn
of
another
sierra
sketching
on
the
dome
no
rain
clouds
at
noon
about
quarter
filled
the
sky
casting
shadows
with
fine
effect
on
the
white
mountains
at
the
heads
of
the
streams
and
a
soothing
cover
over
the
gardens
during
the
warm
hours
saw
a
common
and
a
grasshopper
and
a
brown
bear
the
fly
and
grasshopper
paid
me
a
merry
visit
on
the
top
of
the
dome
and
i
paid
a
visit
to
the
bear
in
the
middle
of
a
small
garden
meadow
between
the
dome
and
the
camp
where
he
was
standing
alert
among
the
flowers
as
if
willing
to
be
seen
to
advantage
i
had
not
gone
more
than
half
a
mile
from
camp
this
morning
when
carlo
who
was
trotting
on
a
few
yards
ahead
of
me
came
to
a
sudden
cautious
standstill
down
went
tail
and
ears
and
forward
went
his
knowing
nose
while
he
seemed
to
be
saying
ha
what
this
a
bear
i
guess
then
a
cautious
advance
of
a
few
steps
setting
his
feet
down
softly
like
a
hunting
cat
and
questioning
the
air
as
to
the
scent
he
had
caught
until
all
doubt
vanished
then
he
came
back
to
me
looked
me
in
the
face
and
with
his
speaking
eyes
reported
a
bear
near
by
then
led
on
softly
careful
like
an
experienced
hunter
not
to
make
the
slightest
noise
and
frequently
looking
back
as
if
whispering
yes
it
a
bear
come
and
i
show
you
presently
we
came
to
where
the
sunbeams
were
streaming
through
between
the
purple
shafts
of
the
firs
which
showed
that
we
were
nearing
an
open
spot
and
here

came
behind
me
evidently
sure
that
the
bear
was
very
near
so
i
crept
to
a
low
ridge
of
moraine
boulders
on
the
edge
of
a
narrow
garden
meadow
and
in
this
meadow
i
felt
pretty
sure
the
bear
must
be
i
was
anxious
to
get
a
good
look
at
the
sturdy
mountaineer
without
alarming
him
so
drawing
myself
up
noiselessly
back
of
one
of
the
largest
of
the
trees
i
peered
past
its
bulging
buttresses
exposing
only
a
part
of
my
head
and
there
stood
neighbor
bruin
within
a
stone
throw
his
hips
covered
by
tall
grass
and
flowers
and
his
front
feet
on
the
trunk
of
a
fir
that
had
fallen
out
into
the
meadow
which
raised
his
head
so
high
that
he
seemed
to
be
standing
erect
he
had
not
yet
seen
me
but
was
looking
and
listening
attentively
showing
that
in
some
way
he
was
aware
of
our
approach
i
watched
his
gestures
and
tried
to
make
the
most
of
my
opportunity
to
learn
what
i
could
about
him
fearing
he
would
catch
sight
of
me
and
run
away
for
i
had
been
told
that
this
sort
of
bear
the
cinnamon
always
ran
from
his
bad
brother
man
never
showing
fight
unless
wounded
or
in
defense
of
young
he
made
a
telling
picture
standing
alert
in
the
sunny
forest
garden
how
well
he
played
his
part
harmonizing
in
bulk
and
color
and
shaggy
hair
with
the
trunks
of
the
trees
and
lush
vegetation
as
natural
a
feature
as
any
other
in
the
landscape
after
examining
at
leisure
noting
the
sharp
muzzle
thrust
inquiringly
forward
the
long
shaggy
hair
on
his
broad
chest
the
stiff
erect
ears
nearly
buried
in
hair
and
the
slow
heavy
way
he
moved
his
head
i
thought
i
should
like
to
see
his
gait
in
running
so
i
made
a
sudden
rush
at
him
shouting
and
swinging
my
hat
to
frighten
him
expecting
to
see
him
make
haste
to
get
away
but
to
my
dismay
he
did
not
run
or
show
any
sign
of
running
on
the
contrary
he
stood
his
ground
ready
to
fight
and
defend
himself
lowered
his
head
thrust
it
forward
and
looked
sharply
and
fiercely
at
me
then
i
suddenly
began
to
fear
that
upon
me
would
fall
the
work
of
running
but
i
was
afraid
to
run
and
therefore
like
the
bear
held
my
ground
we
stood
staring
at
each
other
in
solemn
silence
within
a
dozen
yards
or
thereabouts
while
i
fervently
hoped
that
the
power
of
the
human
eye
over
wild
beasts
would
prove
as
great
as
it
is
said
to
be
how
long
our
awfully
strenuous
interview
lasted
i
do
know
but
at
length
in
the
slow
fullness
of
time
he
pulled
his
huge
paws
down
off
the
log
and
with
magnificent
deliberation
turned
and
walked
leisurely
up
the
meadow
stopping
frequently
to
look
back
over
his
shoulder
to
see
whether
i
was
pursuing
him
then
moving
on
again
evidently
neither
fearing
me
very
much
nor
trusting
me
he
was
probably
about
five
hundred
pounds
in
weight
a
broad
rusty
bundle
of
ungovernable
wildness
a
happy
fellow
whose
lines
have
fallen
in
pleasant
places
the
flowery
glade
in
which
i
saw
him
so
well
framed
like
a
picture
is
one
of
the
best
of
all
i
have
yet
discovered
a
conservatory
of
nature
precious
plant
people
tall
lilies
were
swinging
their
bells
over
that
bear
back
with
geraniums
larkspurs
columbines
and
daisies
brushing
against
his
sides
a
place
for
angels
one
would
say
instead
of
bears
in
the
great
ca単ons
bruin
reigns
supreme
happy
fellow
whom
no
famine
can
reach
while
one
of
his
thousand
kinds
of
food
is
spared
him
his
bread
is
sure
at
all
seasons
ranged
on
the
mountain
shelves
like
stores
in
a
pantry
from
one
to
the
other
up
or
down
he
climbs
tasting
and
enjoying
each
in
turn
in
different
climates
as
if
he
had
journeyed
thousands
of
miles
to
other
countries
north
or
south
to
enjoy
their
varied
productions
i
should
like
to
know
my
hairy
brothers
better
though
after
this
particular
yosemite
bear
my
very
neighbor
had
sauntered
out
of
sight
this
morning
i
reluctantly
went
back
to
camp
for
the
don
rifle
to
shoot
him
if
necessary
in
defense
of
the
flock
fortunately
i
could
find
him
and
after
tracking
him
a
mile
or
two
towards
mount
hoffman
i
bade
him
godspeed
and
gladly
returned
to
my
work
on
the
yosemite
dome
the
also
seemed
at
home
and
buzzed
about
me
as
i
sat
sketching
and
enjoying
my
bear
interview
now
it
was
over
i
wonder
what
draws
so
far
up
the
mountains
heavy
gross
feeders
as
they
are
sensitive
to
cold
and
fond
of
domestic
ease
how
have
they
been
distributed
from
continent
to
continent
across
seas
and
deserts
and
mountain
chains
usually
so
influential
in
determining
boundaries
of
species
both
of
plants
and
animals
beetles
and
butterflies
are
sometimes
restricted
to
small
areas
each
mountain
in
a
range
and
even
the
different
zones
of
a
mountain
may
have
its
own
peculiar
species
but
the
seems
to
be
everywhere
i
wonder
if
any
island
in
is
flyless
the
bluebottle
is
abundant
in
these
yosemite
woods
ever
ready
with
his
marvelous
store
of
eggs
to
make
all
dead
flesh
fly
bumblebees
are
here
and
are
well
fed
on
boundless
stores
of
nectar
and
pollen
the
honeybee
though
abundant
in
the
foothills
has
not
yet
got
so
high
it
is
only
a
few
years
since
the
first
swarm
was
brought
to
california
illustration
track
of
singing
dancing
grasshopper
in
the

over

a
queer
fellow
and
a
jolly
fellow
is
the
grasshopper
up
the
mountains
he
comes
on
excursions
how
high
i
do
know
but
at
least
as
far
and
high
as
yosemite
tourists
i
was
much
interested
with
the
hearty
enjoyment
of
the
one
that
danced
and
sang
for
me
on
the
dome
this
afternoon
he
seemed
brimful
of
glad
hilarious
energy
manifested
by
springing
into
the
air
to
a
height
of
twenty
or
thirty
feet
then
diving
and
springing
up
again
and
making
a
sharp
musical
rattle
just
as
the
lowest
point
in
the
descent
was
reached
up
and
down
a
dozen
times
or
so
he
danced
and
sang
then
alighted
to
rest
then
up
and
at
it
again
the
curves
he
described
in
the
air
in
diving
and
rattling
resembled
those
made
by
cords
hanging
loosely
and
attached
at
the
same
height
at
the
ends
the
loops
nearly
covering
each
other
braver
heartier
keener
enjoyment
of
life
i
have
never
seen
or
heard
in
any
creature
great
or
small
the
life
of
this
comic
redlegs
the
mountain
merriest
child
seems
to
be
made
up
of
pure
condensed
gayety
the
douglas
squirrel
is
the
only
living
creature
that
i
can
compare
him
with
in
exuberant
rollicking
irrepressible
jollity
wonderful
that
these
sublime
mountains
are
so
loudly
cheered
and
brightened
by
a
creature
so
queer
nature
in
him
seems
to
be
snapping
her
fingers
in
the
face
of
all
earthly
dejection
and
melancholy
with
a
boyish
how
the
sound
is
made
i
do
not
understand
when
he
was
on
the
ground
he
made
not
the
slightest
noise
nor
when
he
was
simply
flying
from
place
to
place
but
only
when
diving
in
curves
the
motion
seeming
to
be
required
for
the
sound
for
the
more
vigorous
the
diving
the
more
energetic
the
corresponding
outbursts
of
jolly
rattling
i
tried
to
observe
him
closely
while
he
was
resting
in
the
intervals
of
his
performances
but
he
would
not
allow
a
near
approach
always
getting
his
jumping
legs
ready
to
spring
for
immediate
flight
and
keeping
his
eyes
on
me
a
fine
sermon
the
little
fellow
danced
for
me
on
the
dome
a
likely
place
to
look
for
sermons
in
stones
but
not
for
grasshopper
sermons
a
large
and
imposing
pulpit
for
so
small
a
preacher
no
danger
of
weakness
in
the
knees
of
the
world
while
nature
can
spring
such
a
rattle
as
this
even
the

did
not
express
for
me
the
mountain
wild
health
and
strength
and
happiness
so
tellingly
as
did
this
comical
little
hopper
no
cloud
of

in
his

no
winter
of
discontent
in
sight
to
him
every
day
is

when
at
length
his

sets
i
fancy
he
will
cuddle
down
on

a

of
the

went
bounding
past

this
morning
a
buck
with
wide
spread
of

showing
admirable
vigor
and
grace
wonderful
the
beauty
strength
and
graceful
movements
of
animals
in
wildernesses
cared
for
by
nature
only
when
our
experience
with
domestic

would
lead
us
to
fear
that
all
the
neglected
wild
beasts
would
degenerate
yet
the
upshot
of
nature
method
of
breeding
and
teaching
seems
to
lead
to
excellence
of
every

deer
like
all
wild
animals
are
as
clean
as

the
beauties
of
their
gestures

attitudes
alert

surprise
yet
more
than
their
bounding
exuberant
strength
every
movement

is
graceful

mother
nature
is

often
spoken

no

how
wisely

tenderly
she
loves

looks

her
children
in
all
sorts
of

the
more
i
see
of

the

i
admire
them
as
mountaineers
they
make
their

into
the
heart
of
the
roughest
solitudes
with
smooth

through
dense

across

roaring

ever
showing

find
homes
in

a
truly
admirable
creature
and
great
credit
to
nature
have
been
sketching
a
silver
fir
that
stands
on
a
granite
ridge
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
eastward
of
camp
a
fine
tree
with
a
particular
story
to
tell
it
is
about
one
hundred
feet
high
growing
on
bare
rock
thrusting
its
roots
into
a
weathered
joint
less
than
an
inch
wide
and
bulging
out
to
form
a
base
to
bear
its
weight
the
storm
came
from
the
north
while
it
was
young
and
broke
it
down
nearly
to
the
ground
as
is
shown
by
the
old
dead
top
leaning
out
from
the
living
trunk
built
up
from
a
new
shoot
below
the
break
the
annual
rings
of
the
trunk
that
have
overgrown
the
dead
sapling
tell
the
year
of
the
storm
wonderful
that
a
side
branch
forming
a
portion
of
one
of
the
level
collars
that
encircle
the
trunk
of
this
species
should
bend
upward
grow
erect
and
take
the
place
of
the
lost
axis
to
form
a
new
tree
many
others
pines
as
well
as
firs
bear
testimony
to
the
crushing
severity
of
this
particular
storm
trees
some
of
them
fifty
to
feet
high
were
bent
to
the
ground
and
buried
like
grass
whole
groves
vanishing
as
if
the
forest
had
been
cleared
away
leaving
not
a
branch
or
needle
visible
until
the
spring
thaw
then
the
more
elastic
undamaged
saplings
rose
again
aided
by
the
wind
some
reaching
a
nearly
erect
attitude
others
remaining
more
or
less
bent
while
those
with
broken
backs
endeavored
to
specialize
a
side
branch
below
the
break
and
make
a
leader
of
it
to
form
a
new
axis
of
development
it
is
as
if
a
man
whose
back
was
broken
or
nearly
so
and
who
was
compelled
to
go
bent
should
find
a
branch
backbone
sprouting
straight
up
from
below
the
break
and
should
gradually
develop
new
arms
and
shoulders
and
head
while
the
old
damaged
portion
of
his
body
died
grand
white
cloud
mountains
and
domes
created
about
noon
as
usual
ridges
and
ranges
of
endless
variety
as
if
nature
dearly
loved
this
sort
of
work
doing
it
again
and
again
nearly
every
day
with
infinite
industry
and
producing
beauty
that
never
palls

few
zigzags
of
lightning

power

beauty
that
one
never
wearies
in
beholding
but
hopelessly
unsketchable
and
untellable
what
can
poor
mortals
say
about
clouds
while
a
description
of
their
huge
glowing
domes

shadowy
gulfs
and

ravines
is
being
tried
they
vanish
leaving
no
visible

nevertheless
these
fleeting
sky
mountains
are
as
substantial
and
significant
as
the
more
lasting
upheavals
of
granite
beneath
them
both
alike
are
built
up
and
die
and
in
god
calendar
difference
of
duration
is
nothing
we
can
only
dream
about
them
in
wondering
worshiping
admiration
happier
than
we
dare
tell
even
to
friends
who
see
farthest
in
sympathy
glad
to
know
that
not
a
crystal
or
vapor
particle
of
them
hard
or
soft
is
lost
that
they
sink
and
vanish
only
to
rise
again

again

higher

we
keep
silent
clouds
at
noon
occupying
about
half
the
sky
gave
half
an
hour
of
heavy
rain
to
wash
one

the
cleanest

in

how
well
it
is
washed
the

is
hardly
less
dusty
than
the

domes

plashed
with
snow
like

with
foam
how
fresh
the
woods
are
and
calm
after
the
last
films
of
clouds
have
been
wiped
from
the
sky
a
few
minutes
ago
every
tree
was
excited
bowing
to
the
roaring
storm
waving
swirling
tossing
their
branches
in
glorious
enthusiasm
like
worship
but
though
to
the
outer
ear
these
trees
are
now
silent
their
songs
never
cease
every
hidden
cell
is
throbbing
with
music
and
life
every
fibre
thrilling
like
harp
strings
while
incense
is
ever
flowing
from
the
balsam
bells
and
leaves
no
wonder
the
hills
and
groves
were
god
first
temples
and
the
more
they
are
cut
down
and
hewn
into
cathedrals
and
churches
the
farther
off
and
dimmer
seems
the
lord
himself
the
same
may
be
said
of
stone
temples
yonder
to
the
eastward
of
our
camp
grove
stands
one
of
nature
cathedrals
hewn
from
the
living
rock
almost
conventional
in
form
about
two
thousand
feet
high
nobly
adorned
with
spires
and
pinnacles
thrilling
under
floods
of
sunshine
as
if
alive
like
a
and
well
named
cathedral
peak
even
shepherd
billy
turns
at
times
to
this
wonderful
mountain
building
though
apparently
deaf
to
all
stone
sermons
snow
that
refused
to
melt
in
fire
would
hardly
be
more
wonderful
than
unchanging
dullness
in
the
rays
of
god
beauty
i
have
been
trying
to
get
him
to
walk
to
the
brink
of
yosemite
for
a
view
offering
to
watch
the
sheep
for
a
day
while
he
should
enjoy
what
tourists
come
from
all
over
the
world
to
see
but
though
within
a
mile
of
the
famous
valley
he
will
not
go
to
it
even
out
of
mere
curiosity
what
says
he
is
yosemite
but
a
ca単on
a
lot
of
rocks
a
hole
in
the
ground
a
place
dangerous
about
falling
into

to
keep
away
from
but
think
of
the
waterfalls
billy
just
think
of
that
big
stream
we
crossed
the
other
day
falling
half
a
mile
through
the
air
think
of
that
and
the
sound
it
makes
you
can
hear
it
now
like
the
roar
of
the
sea
thus
i
pressed
yosemite
upon
him
like
a
missionary
offering
the
gospel
but
he
would
have
none
of
it
i
should
be
afraid
to
look
over
so
high
a
wall
he
said
it
would
make
my
head
swim
there
is
nothing
worth
seeing
anywhere
only
rocks
and
i
see
plenty
of
them
here
tourists
that
spend
their
money
to
see
rocks
and
falls
are
fools
that
all
you
ca
humbug
me
i
been
in
this
country
too
long
for
that
such
souls
i
suppose
are
asleep
or
smothered
and
befogged
beneath
mean
pleasures
and
cares
another
cloudland
some
clouds
have
an
decaying
look
watery
and
bedraggled
and
drawn
out
into
shreds
and
patches
giving
the
sky
a
littered
appearance
not
so
these
sierra
summer
midday
clouds
all
are
beautiful
with
smooth
definite
outlines
and
curves
like
those
of
domes
they
begin
to
grow
about
eleven
and
seem
so
wonderfully
near
and
clear
from
this
high
camp
one
is
tempted
to
try
to
climb
them
and
trace
the
streams
that
pour
like
cataracts
from
their
shadowy
fountains
the
rain
to
which
they
give
birth
is
often
very
heavy
a
sort
of
waterfall
as
imposing
as
if
pouring
from
rock
mountains
never
in
all
my
travels
have
i
found
anything
more
truly
novel
and
interesting
than
these
midday
mountains
of
the
sky
their
fine
tones
of
color
majestic
visible
growth
and
scenery
and
general
effects
though
mostly
as
well
let
alone
as
far
as
description
goes
i
oftentimes
think
of
shelley
cloud

i
sift
the

mount
hoffman
and
lake
tenaya
ramble
to
the
summit
of
mount
hoffman
eleven
thousand
feet
high
the
highest
point
in
life
journey
my
feet
have
yet
touched
and
what
glorious
landscapes
are
about
me
new
plants
new
animals
new
crystals
and
multitudes
of
new
mountains
far
higher
than
hoffman
towering
in
glorious
array
along
the
axis
of
the
range
serene
majestic
vast
domes
and
ridges
shining
below
them
forests
lakes
and
meadows
in
the
hollows
the
pure
blue
sky
brooding
them
all
a
glory
day
of
admission
into
a
new
realm
of
wonders
as
if
nature
had
wooingly
whispered
come
higher
what
questions
i
asked
and
how
little
i
know
of
all
the
vast
show
and
how
eagerly
tremulously
hopeful
of
some
day
knowing
more
learning
the
meaning
of
these
divine
symbols
crowded
together
on
this
wondrous
page
mount
hoffman
is
the
highest
part
of
a
ridge
or
spur
about
fourteen
miles
from
the
axis
of
the
main
range
perhaps
a
remnant
brought
into
relief
and
isolated
by
unequal
denudation
the
southern
slopes
shed
their
waters
into
yosemite
valley
by
tenaya
and
dome
creeks
the
northern
in
part
into
the
tuolumne
river
but
mostly
into
the
merced
by
yosemite
creek
the
rock
is
mostly
granite
with
some
small
piles
and
crests
rising
here
and
there
in
picturesque
pillared
and
castellated
remnants
of
red
metamorphic
slates
both
the
granite
and
slates
are
divided
by
joints
making
them
separable
into
blocks
like
the
stones
of
artificial
masonry
suggesting
the
scripture
he
hath
builded
the
mountains
great
banks
of
snow
and
ice
are
piled
in
hollows
on
the
cool
precipitous
north
side
forming
the
highest
perennial
sources
of
yosemite
creek
the
southern
slopes
are
much
more
gradual
and
accessible
narrow
gorges
extend
across
the
summit
at
right
angles
which
look
like
lanes
formed
evidently
by
the
erosion
of
less
resisting
beds
they
are
usually
called
devil
slides
though
they
lie
far
above
the
region
usually
haunted
by
the
devil
for
though
we
read
that
he
once
climbed
an
exceeding
high
mountain
he
can
not
be
much
of
a
mountaineer
for
his
tracks
are
seldom
seen
above
the
illustration
approach
of
dome
creek
to
yosemite
the
broad
gray
summit
is
barren
and
in
general
views
wasted
by
ages
of
gnawing
storms
but
looking
at
the
surface
in
detail
one
finds
it
covered
by
thousands
and
millions
of
charming
plants
with
leaves
and
flowers
so
small
they
form
no
mass
of
color
visible
at
a
distance
of
a
few
hundred
yards
beds
of
azure
daisies
smile
confidingly
in
moist
hollows
and
along
the
banks
of
small
rills
with
several
species
of
eriogonum
ivesia
pentstemon
orthocarpus
and
patches
of
a
beautiful
shrubby
species
here
also
i
found
bryanthus
a
charming
heathwort
covered
with
purple
flowers
and
dark
green
foliage
like
heather
and
three
trees
new
to
me
a
hemlock
and
two
pines
the
hemlock
is
the
most
beautiful
conifer
i
have
ever
seen
the
branches
and
also
the
main
axis
droop
in
a
singularly
graceful
way
and
the
dense
foliage
covers
the
delicate
sensitive
swaying
branchlets
all
around
it
is
now
in
full
bloom
and
the
flowers
together
with
thousands
of
last
season
cones
still
clinging
to
the
drooping
sprays
display
wonderful
wealth
of
color
brown
and
purple
and
blue
gladly
i
climbed
the
first
tree
i
found
to
revel
in
the
midst
of
it
how
the
touch
of
the
flowers
makes
one
flesh
tingle
the
pistillate
are
dark
rich
purple
and
almost
translucent
the
staminate
blue
a
vivid
pure
tone
of
blue
like
the
mountain
sky
the
most
uncommonly
beautiful
of
all
the
sierra
tree
flowers
i
have
seen
how
wonderful
that
with
all
its
delicate
feminine
grace
and
beauty
of
form
and
dress
and
behavior
this
lovely
tree
up
here
exposed
to
the
wildest
blasts
has
already
endured
the
storms
of
centuries
of
winters
the
two
pines
also
are
brave
trees
the
mountain
pine
and
the
dwarf
pine
the
mountain
pine
is
closely
related
to
the
sugar
pine
though
the
cones
are
only
about
four
to
six
inches
long
the
largest
trees
are
from
five
to
six
feet
in
diameter
at
four
feet
above
the
ground
the
bark
rich
brown
only
a
few
adventurers
approach
the
summit
of
the
mountain
the
dwarf
or
pine
is
the
species
that
forms
the
where
it
is
so
completely
dwarfed
that
one
may
walk
over
the
top
of
a
bed
of
it
as
over
chaparral
how
boundless
the
day
seems
as
we
revel
in
these
sky
gardens
amid
so
vast
a
congregation
of
onlooking
mountains
strange
and
admirable
it
is
that
the
more
savage
and
chilly
and
the
mountains
the
finer
the
glow
on
their
faces
and
the
finer
the
plants
they
bear
the
myriads
of
flowers
tingeing
the
do
not
seem
to
have
grown
out
of
the
dry
rough
gravel
of
disintegration
but
rather
they
appear
as
visitors
a
cloud
of
witnesses
to
nature
love
in
what
we
in
our
timid
ignorance
and
unbelief
call
howling
desert
the
surface
of
the
ground
so
dull
and
forbidding
at
first
sight
besides
being
rich
in
plants
shines
and
sparkles
with
crystals
mica
hornblende
feldspar
quartz
tourmaline
the
radiance
in
some
places
is
so
great
as
to
be
fairly
dazzling
keen
lance
rays
of
every
color
flashing
sparkling
in
glorious
abundance
joining
the
plants
in
their
fine
brave
every
crystal
every
flower
a
window
opening
into
heaven
a
mirror
reflecting
the
creator
from
garden
to
garden
ridge
to
ridge
i
drifted
enchanted
now
on
my
knees
gazing
into
the
face
of
a
daisy
now
climbing
again
and
again
among
the
purple
and
azure
flowers
of
the
hemlocks
now
down
into
the
treasuries
of
the
snow
or
gazing
afar
over
domes
and
peaks
lakes
and
woods
and
the
billowy
glaciated
fields
of
the
upper
tuolumne
and
trying
to
sketch
them
in
the
midst
of
such
beauty
pierced
with
its
rays
one
body
is
all
one
tingling
palate
who
would
be
a
mountaineer
up
here
all
the
world
prizes
seem
nothing

the
many

and
the

with
an
imposing

dipping
its

into
it
on
the

cathedral

a
few
miles
above
its

many

the

with

the
eye
is
soon
drawn
away
from
these

attractive
to
revel
in

carlo
caught
an
unfortunate
woodchuck
when
it
was
running
from
a
grassy
spot
to
its
home
one
of
the
hardiest
of
the
mountain
animals
i
tried
hard
to
save
him
but
in
vain
after
telling
carlo
that
he
must
be
careful
not
to
kill
anything
i
caught
sight
for
the
first
time
of
the
curious
pika
or
little
chief
hare
that
cuts
large
quantities
of
lupines
and
other
plants
and
lays
them
out
to
dry
in
the
sun
for
hay
which
it
stores
in
underground
barns
to
last
through
the
long
snowy
winter
coming
upon
these
plants
freshly
cut
and
lying
in
handfuls
here
and
there
on
the
rocks
has
a
startling
effect
of
busy
life
on
the
lonely
these
little
haymakers
endowed
with
brain
stuff
something
like
our
own
god
up
here
looking
after
them
what
lessons
they
teach
how
they
widen
our
sympathy
an
eagle
soaring
above
a
sheer
cliff
where
i
suppose
its
nest
is
makes
another
striking
show
of
life
and
helps
to
bring
to
mind
the
other
people
of
the
solitude
deer
in
the
forest
caring
for
their
young
the
strong
bears
the
lively
throng
of
squirrels
the
blessed
birds
great
and
small
stirring
and
sweetening
the
groves
and
the
clouds
of
happy
insects
filling
the
sky
with
joyous
hum
as
part
and
parcel
of
the
sunshine
all
these
come
to
mind
as
well
as
the
plant
people
and
the
glad
streams
singing
their
way
to
the
sea
but
most
impressive
of
all
is
the
vast
glowing
countenance
of
the
wilderness
in
awful
infinite
repose
toward
sunset
enjoyed
a
fine
run
to
camp
down
the
long
south
slopes
across
ridges
and
ravines
gardens
and
avalanche
gaps
through
the
firs
and
chaparral
enjoying
wild
excitement
and
excess
of
strength
and
so
ends
a
day
that
will
never
end
up
and
away
to
lake
tenaya
another
big
day
enough
for
a
lifetime
the
rocks
the
air
everything
speaking
with
audible
voice
or
silent
joyful
wonderful
enchanting
banishing
weariness
and
sense
of
time
no
longing
for
anything
now
or
hereafter
as
we
go
home
into
the
mountain
heart
the
level
sunbeams
are
touching
the
every
leaf
shining
with
dew
am
holding
an
easterly
course
the
deep
ca単on
of
tenaya
creek
on
the
right
hand
mount
hoffman
on
the
left
and
the
lake
straight
ahead
about
ten
miles
distant
the
summit
of
mount
hoffman
about
three
thousand
feet
above
me
tenaya
creek
four
thousand
feet
below
and
separated
from
the
shallow
irregular
valley
along
which
most
of
the
way
lies
by
smooth
domes
and
many
mossy
emerald
bogs
meadows
and
gardens
in
rocky
hollows
to
wade
and
saunter
through
and
what
fine
plants
they
give
me
what
joyful
streams
i
have
to
cross
and
how
many
views
are
displayed
of
the
hoffman
and
cathedral
peak
masonry
and
what
a
wondrous
breadth
of
shining
granite
pavement
to
walk
over
for
the
first
time
about
the
shores
of
the
lake
on
i
sauntered
in
freedom
complete
body
without
weight
as
far
as
i
was
aware
now
wading
through
starry
parnassia
bogs
now
through
gardens
shoulder
deep
in
larkspur
and
lilies
grasses
and
rushes
shaking
off
showers
of
dew
crossing
piles
of
crystalline
moraine
boulders
bright
mirror
pavements
and
cool
cheery
streams
going
to
yosemite
crossing
bryanthus
carpets
and
the
scoured
pathways
of
avalanches
and
thickets
of
ceanothus
then
down
a
broad
majestic
stairway
into
the
the
snow
on
the
high
mountains
is
melting
fast
and
the
streams
are
singing
swaying
softly
through
the
level
meadows
and
bogs
quivering
with
swirling
in
resting
in
deep
pools
leaping
shouting
in
wild
exulting
energy
over
rough
boulder
dams
joyful
beautiful
in
all
their
forms
no
sierra
landscape
that
i
have
seen
holds
anything
truly
dead
or
dull
or
any
trace
of
what
in
manufactories
is
called
rubbish
or
waste
everything
is
perfectly
clean
and
pure
and
full
of
divine
lessons
this
quick
inevitable
interest
attaching
to
everything
seems
marvelous
until
the
hand
of
god
becomes
visible
then
it
seems
reasonable
that
what
interests
him
may
well
interest
us
when
we
try
to
pick
out
anything
by
itself
we
find
it
hitched
to
everything
else
in
the
universe
one
fancies
a
heart
like
our
own
must
be
beating
in
every
crystal
and
cell
and
we
feel
like
stopping
to
speak
to
the
plants
and
animals
as
friendly
fellow
mountaineers
nature
as
a
poet
an
enthusiastic
workingman
becomes
more
and
more
visible
the
farther
and
higher
we
go
for
the
mountains
are
fountains
beginning
places
however
related
to
sources
beyond
mortal
ken
i
found
three
kinds
of
meadows
those
contained
in
basins
not
yet
filled
with
earth
enough
to
make
a
dry
surface
they
are
planted
with
several
species
of
carex
and
have
their
margins
diversified
with
robust
flowering
plants
such
as
veratrum
larkspur
lupine
etc
those
contained
in
the
same
sort
of
basins
once
lakes
like
the
first
but
so
situated
in
relation
to
the
streams
that
flow
through
them
and
beds
of
transportable
sand
gravel
that
they
are
now
high
and
dry
and
well
drained
this
dry
condition
and
corresponding
difference
in
their
vegetation
may
be
caused
by
no
superiority
of
position
or
power
of
transporting
filling
material
in
the
streams
that
belong
to
them
but
simply
by
the
basin
being
shallow
and
therefore
sooner
filled
they
are
planted
with
grasses
mostly
fine
silky
and
rather
and
being
the
principal
genera
they
form
delightfully
smooth
level
sods
in
which
one
finds
two
or
three
species
of
gentian
and
as
many
of
purple
and
yellow
orthocarpus
violet
vaccinium
kalmia
bryanthus
and
lonicera
meadows
hanging
on
ridge
and
mountain
slopes
not
in
basins
at
all
but
made
and
held
in
place
by
masses
of
boulders
and
fallen
trees
which
forming
dams
one
above
another
in
close
succession
on
small
outspread
channelless
streams
have
collected
soil
enough
for
the
growth
of
grasses
carices
and
many
flowering
plants
and
being
kept
well
watered
without
being
subject
to
currents
sufficiently
strong
to
carry
them
away
a
hanging
or
sloping
meadow
is
the
result
their
surfaces
are
seldom
so
smooth
as
the
others
being
roughened
more
or
less
by
the
projecting
tops
of
the
dam
rocks
or
logs
but
at
a
little
distance
this
roughness
is
not
noticed
and
the
effect
is
very
striking
bright
green
fluent
flowery
ribbons
on
gray
slopes
the
broad
shallow
streams
these
meadows
belong
to
are
mostly
derived
from
banks
of
snow
and
because
the
soil
is
well
drained
in
some
places
while
in
others
the
dam
rocks
are
packed
close
and
caulked
with
bits
of
wood
and
leaves
making
boggy
patches
the
vegetation
of
course
is
correspondingly
varied
i
saw
patches
of
willow
bryanthus
and
a
fine
show
of
lilies
on
some
of
them
not
forming
a
margin
but
scattered
about
among
the
carex
and
grass
most
of
these
meadows
are
now
in
their
prime
how
wonderful
must
be
the
temper
of
the
elastic
leaves
of
grasses
and
sedges
to
make
curves
so
perfect
and
fine
tempered
a
little
harder
they
would
stand
erect
stiff
and
bristly
like
strips
of
metal
a
little
softer
and
every
leaf
would
lie
flat
and
what
fine
painting
and
tinting
there
is
on
the
glumes
and
pales
stamens
and
feathery
pistils
butterflies
colored
like
the
flowers
waver
above
them
in
wonderful
profusion
and
many
other
beautiful
winged
people
numbered
and
known
and
loved
only
by
the
lord
are
waltzing
together
high
over
head
seemingly
in
pure
play
and
hilarious
enjoyment
of
their
little
sparks
of
life
how
wonderful
they
are
how
do
they
get
a
living
and
endure
the
weather
how
are
their
little
bodies
with
muscles
nerves
organs
kept
warm
and
jolly
in
such
admirable
exuberant
health
regarded
only
as
mechanical
inventions
how
wonderful
they
are
compared
with
these
godlike
man
greatest
machines
are
as
nothing
most
of
the
sandy
gardens
on
moraines
are
in
prime
beauty
like
the
meadows
though
some
on
the
north
sides
of
rocks
and
beneath
groves
of
sapling
pines
have
not
yet
bloomed
on
sunny
sheets
of
crystal
soil
along
the
slopes
of
the
hoffman
mountains
i
saw
extensive
patches
of
ivesia
and
purple
gilia
with
scarce
a
green
leaf
making
fine
clouds
of
color
ribes
bushes
vaccinium
and
kalmia
now
in
flower
make
beautiful
rugs
and
borders
along
the
banks
of
the
streams
shaggy
beds
of
dwarf
oak
var
over
which
one
may
walk
are
common
on
rocky
moraines
yet
this
is
the
same
species
as
the
large
live
oak
seen
near
brown
flat
the
most
beautiful
of
the
shrubs
is
the
bryanthus
here
making
glorious
carpets
at
an
elevation
of
nine
thousand
feet
the
principal
tree
for
the
first
mile
or
two
from
camp
is
the
magnificent
silver
fir
which
reaches
perfection
here
both
in
size
and
form
of
individual
trees
and
in
the
mode
of
grouping
in
groves
with
open
spaces
between
so
trim
and
tasteful
are
these
silvery
spiry
groves
one
would
fancy
they
must
have
been
placed
in
position
by
some
master
landscape
gardener
their
regularity
seeming
almost
conventional
but
nature
is
the
only
gardener
able
to
do
work
so
fine
a
few
noble
specimens
two
hundred
feet
high
occupy
central
positions
in
the
groups
with
younger
trees
around
them
and
outside
of
these
another
circle
of
yet
smaller
ones
the
whole
arranged
like
tastefully
symmetrical
bouquets
every
tree
fitting
nicely
the
place
assigned
to
it
as
if
made
especially
for
it
small
roses
and
eriogonums
are
usually
found
blooming
on
the
open
spaces
about
the
groves
forming
charming
pleasure
grounds
higher
the
firs
gradually
become
smaller
and
less
perfect
many
showing
double
summits
indicating
storm
stress
still
where
good
moraine
soil
is
found
even
on
the
rim
of
the
specimens
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
height
and
five
feet
in
diameter
occur
nearly
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
the
saplings
i
find
are
mostly
bent
with
the
crushing
weight
of
the
winter
snow
which
at
this
elevation
must
be
at
least
eight
or
ten
feet
deep
judging
by
marks
on
the
trees
and
this
depth
of
compacted
snow
is
heavy
enough
to
bend
and
bury
young
trees
twenty
or
thirty
feet
in
height
and
hold
them
down
for
four
or
five
months
some
are
broken
the
others
spring
up
when
the
snow
melts
and
at
length
attain
a
size
that
enables
them
to
withstand
the
snow
pressure
yet
even
in
trees
five
feet
thick
the
traces
of
this
early
discipline
are
still
plainly
to
be
seen
in
their
curved
insteps
and
frequently
in
old
dried
saplings
protruding
from
the
trunk
partially
overgrown
by
the
new
axis
developed
from
a
branch
below
the
break
yet
through
all
this
stress
the
forest
is
maintained
in
marvelous
beauty
beyond
the
silver
firs
i
find
the
pine
var
forms
the
bulk
of
the
forest
up
to
an
elevation
of
ten
thousand
feet
or
more
the
highest
of
the
sierra
i
saw
a
specimen
nearly
five
feet
in
diameter
growing
on
deep
soil
at
an
elevation
of
about
nine
thousand
feet
the
form
of
this
species
varies
very
much
with
position
exposure
soil
etc
on
where
it
is
closely
planted
it
is
very
slender
some
specimens
feet
high
do
not
exceed
five
inches
in
diameter
at
the
ground
but
the
ordinary
form
as
far
as
i
have
seen
is
well
proportioned
the
average
diameter
when
full
grown
at
this
elevation
is
about
twelve
or
fourteen
inches
height
forty
or
fifty
feet
the
straggling
branches
bent
up
at
the
end
the
bark
thin
and
bedraggled
with
resin
the
pistillate
flowers
form
little
crimson
rosettes
a
fourth
of
an
inch
in
diameter
on
the
ends
of
the
branchlets
mostly
hidden
in
the
the
staminate
are
about
three
eighths
of
an
inch
in
diameter
in
showy
clusters
giving
a
remarkably
rich
effect
a
brave
hardy
mountaineer
pine
growing
cheerily
on
rough
beds
of
avalanche
boulders
and
joints
of
rock
pavements
as
well
as
in
fertile
hollows
standing
up
to
the
waist
in
snow
every
winter
for
centuries
facing
a
thousand
storms
and
blooming
every
year
in
colors
as
bright
as
those
worn
by
the
trees
of
the

a
still
hardier
mountaineer
is
the
sierra

growing
mostly
on
domes
and
ridges
and
glacier

a
thickset
sturdy
picturesque

seemingly
content
to
live
for

than
a

truly
wonderful

dogged
endurance
expressed
in
every
feature
lasting
about
as
long
as
the

stands

are
nearly
as
broad
as
high
i
saw
one
on
the
shore
of
the
lake
nearly
ten
feet
in
diameter
and
many
six
to
eight
feet
the
bark
flakes
off
in
long
strips
with
a
satiny
luster
surely
the
most
enduring
of
all

it
never
seems
to
die
a
natural
death
or
even
to
fall
after
it
has
been
killed
if
protected
from
accidents
it
would
perhaps
be
immortal
i
saw
some
that
had
withstood
an
avalanche
from
snowy
mount
hoffman
cheerily
putting
out
new
branches
as
if
repeating
like
grip
never
say
die
some
were
simply
standing
on
the
pavement
where
no
fissure
more
than
half
an
inch
wide
offered
a
hold
for
its
roots
the
common
height
for
these
is
from
ten
to
twenty
feet
most
of
the
old
ones
have
broken
tops
and
are
mere
stumps
with
a
few
tufted
branches
forming
picturesque
brown
pillars
on
bare
pavements
with
plenty
of
and
a
clear
view
in
every
direction
on
good

soil
it
reaches
a
height
of
from
forty
to
sixty
feet
with

thin
eighty
to
an

some
specimens
i
examined
those
ten
feet
in

must
be
very
old
thousands
of

wish
i
could
live
like
these
junipers
on
sunshine
and
snow
and
stand
beside
them
on
the

of

for
a
thousand

how
much
i
should

everything

junipers
in
tenaya
ca単on
the
lake
was
named
for
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
yosemite
tribe
old
tenaya
is
said
to
have
been
a
good
indian
to
his
tribe
when
a
company
of
soldiers
followed
his
band
into
yosemite
to
punish
them
for
and
other
crimes
they
fled
to
this
lake
by
a
trail
that
leads
out
of
the
upper
end
of
the
valley
early
in
the
spring
while
the
snow
was
still
deep
but
being
pursued
they
lost
heart
and
surrendered
a
fine
monument
the
old
man
has
in
this
bright
lake
and
likely
to
last
a
long
time
though
lakes
die
as
well
as
indians
being
gradually
filled
with
detritus
carried
in
by
the
feeding
streams
and
to
some
extent
also
by
snow
avalanches
and
rain
and
wind
a
considerable
portion
of
the
tenaya
basin
is
already
changed
into
a
forested
flat
and
meadow
at
the
upper
end
where
the
main
tributary
enters
from
cathedral
peak
two
other
tributaries
come
from
the
hoffman
range
the
outlet
flows
westward
through
tenaya
ca単on
to
join
the
merced
river
in
yosemite
scarce
a
handful
of
loose
soil
is
to
be
seen
on
the
north
shore
all
is
bare
shining
granite
suggesting
the
indian
name
of
the
lake
pywiack
meaning
shining
rock
the
basin
seems
to
have
been
slowly
excavated
by
the
ancient
glaciers
a
marvelous
work
requiring
countless
thousands
of
years
on
the
south
side
an
imposing
mountain
rises
from
the
edge
to
a
height
of
three
thousand
feet
or
more
feathered
with
hemlock
and
pine
and
huge
shining
domes
on
the
east
over
the
tops
of
which
the
grinding
wasting
molding
glacier
must
have
swept
as
the
wind
does
no
cloud
mountains
only
curly
cirrus
wisps
scarce
perceptible
and
the
want
of
thunder
to
strike
the
noon
hour
seems
strange
as
if
the
sierra
clock
had
stopped
have
been
studying
the
fir
measured
one
near
two
hundred
and
forty
feet
high
the
tallest
i
have
yet
seen
this
species
is
the
most
symmetrical
of
all
conifers
but
though
gigantic
in
size
it
seldom
lives
more
than
four
or
five
hundred
years
most
of
the
trees
die
from
the
attacks
of
a
fungus
at
the
age
of
two
or
three
centuries
this
fungus
perhaps
enters
the
trunk
by
way
of
the
stumps
of
limbs
broken
off
by
the
snow
that
loads
the
broad
palmate
branches
the
younger
specimens
are
marvels
of
symmetry
straight
and
erect
as
a
their
branches
in
regular
level
whorls
of
five
mostly
each
branch
as
exact
in
its
divisions
as
a
fern
frond
and
thickly
covered
by
the
leaves
making
a
rich
plush
over
all
the
tree
excepting
only
the
trunk
and
a
small
portion
of
the
main
limbs
the
leaves
turn
upward
especially
on
the
branchlets
and
are
stiff
and
sharp
pointed
on
all
the
upper
portion
of
the
tree
they
remain
on
the
tree
about
eight
or
ten
years
and
as
the
growth
is
rapid
it
is
not
rare
to
find
the
leaves
still
in
place
on
the
upper
part
of
the
axis
where
it
is
three
to
four
inches
in
diameter
wide
apart
of
course
and
their
spiral
arrangement
beautifully
displayed
the
are
conspicuous
for
twenty
years
or
more
but
there
is
a
good
deal
of
variation
in
different
trees
as
to
the
thickness
and
sharpness
of
the
leaves
after
the
excursion
to
mount
hoffman
i
had
seen
a
complete
of
the
sierra
forest
and
i
find
that
is
the
most
symmetrical
tree
of
all
the
noble
coniferous
company
the
cones
are
grand
affairs
superb
in
form
size
and
color
cylindrical
stand
erect
on
the
upper
branches
like
casks
and
are
from
five
to
eight
inches
in
length
by
three
or
four
in
diameter
greenish
gray
and
covered
with
fine
down
which
has
a
silvery
luster
in
the
sunshine
and
their
brilliance
is
augmented
by
beads
of
transparent
balsam
which
seems
to
have
been
poured
over
each
cone
bringing
to
mind
the
old
ceremonies
of
anointing
with
oil
if
possible
the
inside
of
the
cone
is
more
beautiful
than
the
outside
the
scales
bracts
and
seed
wings
are
tinted
with
the
loveliest
rosy
purple
with
a
bright
lustrous
iridescence
the
seeds
three
fourths
of
an
inch
long
are
dark
brown
when
the
cones
are
ripe
the
scales
and
bracts
fall
off
setting
the
seeds
free
to
fly
to
their
predestined
places
while
the
dead
axes
are
left
on
the
branches
for
many
years
to
mark
the
positions
of
the
vanished
cones
excepting
those
cut
off
when
green
by
the
douglas
squirrel
how
he
gets
his
teeth
under
the
broad
bases
of
the
sessile
cones
i
do
know
climbing
these
trees
on
a
sunny
day
to
visit
the
growing
cones
and
to
gaze
over
the
tops
of
the
forest
is
one
of
my
best
enjoyments
bright
cool
exhilarating
clouds
about
another
glorious
day
of
rambling
sketching
and
universal
enjoyment
clouds
but
the
regular
shower
did
not
reach
us
though
thunder
was
heard
a
few
miles
off
striking
the
noon
hour
ants
flies
and
mosquitoes
seem
to
enjoy
this
fine
climate
a
few
have
discovered
our
camp
the
sierra
mosquitoes
are
courageous
and
of
good
size
some
of
them
measuring
nearly
an
inch
from
tip
of
sting
to
tip
of
folded
wings
though
less
abundant
than
in
most
wildernesses
they
occasionally
make
quite
a
hum
and
stir
and
pay
but
little
attention
to
time
or
place
they
sting
anywhere
any
time
of
day
wherever
they
can
find
anything
worth
while
until
they
are
themselves
stung
by
frost
the
large
ants
are
only
ticklish
and
troublesome
when
one
is
lying
down
under
the
trees
noticed
a
borer
drilling
a
silver
fir
ovipositor
about
an
inch
and
a
half
in
length
polished
and
straight
like
a
needle
when
not
in
use
it
is
folded
back
in
a
sheath
which
extends
straight
behind
like
the
legs
of
a
crane
in
flying
this
drilling
i
suppose
is
to
save
nest
building
and
the
after
care
of
feeding
the
young
who
would
guess
that
in
the
brain
of
a
fly
so
much
knowledge
could
find
lodgment
how
do
they
know
that
their
eggs
will
hatch
in
such
holes
or
after
they
hatch
that
the
soft
helpless
grubs
will
find
the
right
sort
of
nourishment
in
silver
fir
sap
this
domestic
arrangement
calls
to
mind
the
curious
family
of
gallflies
each
species
seems
to
know
what
kind
of
plant
will
respond
to
the
irritation
or
stimulus
of
the
puncture
it
makes
and
the
eggs
it
lays
in
forming
a
growth
that
not
only
answers
for
a
nest
and
home
but
also
provides
food
for
the
young
probably
these
gallflies
make
mistakes
at
times
like
anybody
else
but
when
they
do
there
is
simply
a
failure
of
that
particular
brood
while
enough
to
perpetuate
the
species
do
find
the
proper
plants
and
nourishment
many
mistakes
of
this
kind
might
be
made
without
being
discovered
by
us
once
a
pair
of
wrens
made
the
mistake
of
building
a
nest
in
the
sleeve
of
a
workman
coat
which
was
called
for
at
sundown
much
to
the
consternation
and
discomfiture
of
the
birds
still
the
marvel
remains
that
any
of
the
children
of
such
small
people
as
gnats
and
mosquitoes
should
escape
their
own
and
their
parents
mistakes
as
well
as
the
vicissitudes
of
the
weather
and
hosts
of
enemies
and
come
forth
in
full
vigor
and
perfection
to
enjoy
the
sunny
world
when
we
think
of
the
small
creatures
that
are
visible
we
are
led
to
think
of
many
that
are
smaller
still
and
lead
us
on
and
on
into
infinite
mystery
another
glorious
day
the
air
as
delicious
to
the
lungs
as
nectar
to
the
tongue
indeed
the
body
seems
one
palate
and
tingles
equally
throughout
cloudiness
about
but
our
ordinary
shower
has
not
yet
reached
us
though
i
hear
thunder
in
the
distance
the
cheery
little
chipmunk
so
common
about
brown
flat
is
common
here
also
and
perhaps
other
species
in
their
light
airy
habits
they
recall
the
familiar
species
of
the
eastern
states
which
we
admired
in
the
oak
openings
of
wisconsin
as
they
skimmed
along
the
zigzag
rail
fences
these
sierra
chipmunks
are
more
arboreal
and
i
first
noticed
them
on
the
lower
edge
of
the
coniferous
belt
where
the
sabine
and
yellow
pines
meet
exceedingly
interesting
little
fellows
full
of
odd
funny
ways
and
without
being
true
squirrels
have
most
of
their
accomplishments
without
their
aggressive
quarrelsomeness
i
never
weary
watching
them
as
they
frisk
about
in
the
bushes
gathering
seeds
and
berries
like
song
sparrows
poising
daintily
on
slender
twigs
and
making
even
less
stir
than
most
birds
of
the
same
size
few
of
the
sierra
animals
interest
me
more
they
are
so
able
gentle
confiding
and
beautiful
they
take
one
heart
and
get
themselves
adopted
as
darlings
though
weighing
hardly
more
than
field
mice
they
are
laborious
collectors
of
seeds
nuts
and
cones
and
are
therefore
well
fed
but
never
in
the
least
swollen
with
fat
or
lazily
full
on
the
contrary
of
their
frisky
birdlike
liveliness
there
is
no
end
they
have
a
great
variety
of
notes
corresponding
with
their
movements
some
sweet
and
liquid
like
water
dripping
with
tinkling
sounds
into
pools
they
seem
dearly
to
love
teasing
a
dog
coming
frequently
almost
within
reach
then
frisking
away
with
lively
chipping
like
sparrows
beating
time
to
their
music
with
their
tails
which
at
each
chip
describe
half
circles
from
side
to
side
not
even
the
douglas
squirrel
is
or
more
fearless
i
have
seen
them
running
about
on
sheer
precipices
of
the
yosemite
walls
seemingly
holding
on
with
as
little
effort
as
flies
and
as
unconscious
of
danger
where
if
the
slightest
slip
were
made
they
would
have
fallen
two
or
three
thousand
feet
how
fine
it
would
be
could
we
mountaineers
climb
these
tremendous
cliffs
with
the
same
sure
grip
the
venture
i
made
the
other
day
for
a
view
of
the
yosemite
fall
and
which
tried
my
nerves
so
sorely
this
little
tamias
would
have
made
for
an
ear
of
grass
the
woodchuck
of
the
bleak
is
a
very
different
sort
of
mountaineer
the
most
bovine
of
rodents
a
heavy
eater
fat
aldermanic
in
bulk
and
fairly
bloated
in
his
high
pastures
like
a
cow
in
a
clover
field
one
woodchuck
would
outweigh
a
hundred
chipmunks
and
yet
he
is
by
no
means
a
dull
animal
in
the
midst
of
what
we
regard
as
desolation
he
pipes
and
whistles
right
cheerily
and
enjoys
long
life
in
his
skyland
homes
his
burrow
is
made
in
disintegrated
rocks
or
beneath
large
boulders
coming
out
of
his
den
in
the
cold
hoarfrost
mornings
he
takes
a
on
some
favorite
rock
then
goes
to
breakfast
in
garden
hollows
eats
grass
and
flowers
until
comfortably
swollen
then
goes
to
fight
and
play
how
long
a
woodchuck
lives
in
this
bracing
air
i
do
know
but
some
of
them
are
rusty
and
gray
like
boulders
a
grand
cloudland
and
shower
refreshing
the
blessed
wilderness
already
so
fragrant
and
fresh
steeping
the
black
meadow
mold
and
dead
leaves
like
tea
the
waycup
or
flicker
so
familiar
to
every
boy
in
the
old
middle
west
states
is
one
of
the
most
common
of
the
hereabouts
and
makes
one
feel
at
home
i
can
see
no
difference
in
plumage
or
habits
from
the
eastern
species
though
the
climate
here
is
so
different
a
fine
brave
confiding
beautiful
bird
the
robin
too
is
here
with
all
his
familiar
notes
and
gestures
tripping
daintily
on
open
garden
spots
and
high
meadows
over
all
america
he
seems
to
be
at
home
moving
from
the
plains
to
the
mountains
and
from
north
to
south
back
and
forth
up
and
down
with
the
march
of
the
seasons
and
food
supply
how
admirable
the
constitution
and
temper
of
this
brave
singer
keeping
in
cheery
health
over
so
vast
and
varied
a
range
oftentimes
as
i
wander
through
these
solemn
woods
and
silent
i
hear
the
reassuring
voice
of
this
fellow
wanderer
ringing
out
sweet
and
clear
fear
not
fear
not
the
mountain
quail
i
often
meet
in
my
walks
a
small
brown
partridge
with
a
very
long
slender
ornamental
crest
worn
jauntily
like
a
feather
in
a
boy
cap
giving
it
a
very
marked
appearance
this
species
is
considerably
larger
than
the
valley
quail
so
common
on
the
hot
foothills
they
seldom
alight
in
trees
but
love
to
wander
in
flocks
of
from
five
or
six
to
twenty
through
the
ceanothus
and
manzanita
thickets
and
over
open
dry
meadows
and
rocks
of
the
ridges
where
the
forest
is
less
dense
or
wanting
uttering
a
low
clucking
sound
to
enable
them
to
keep
together
when
disturbed
they
rise
with
a
strong
birr
of
and
scatter
as
if
exploded
to
a
distance
of
a
quarter
of
a
mile
or
so
after
the
danger
is
past
they
call
one
another
together
with
a
loud
piping
note
nature
beautiful
mountain
chickens
i
have
not
yet
found
their
nests
the
young
of
this
season
are
already
hatched
and
away
new
broods
of
happy
wanderers
half
as
large
as
their
parents
i
wonder
how
they
live
through
the
long
winters
when
the
ground
is
ten
feet
deep
they
must
go
down
towards
the
lower
edge
of
the
forest
like
the
deer
though
i
have
not
heard
of
them
there
the
blue
or
dusky
grouse
is
also
common
here
they
like
the
deepest
and
closest
fir
woods
and
when
disturbed
burst
from
the
branches
of
the
trees
with
a
strong
loud
whir
of
and
vanish
in
a
wavering
silent
slide
without
moving
a
feather
a
stout
beautiful
bird
about
the
size
of
the
prairie
chicken
of
the
old
west
spending
most
of
the
time
in
the
trees
excepting
the
breeding
season
when
it
keeps
to
the
ground
the
young
are
now
able
to
fly
when
scattered
by
man
or
dog
they
keep
still
until
the
danger
is
supposed
to
be
passed
then
the
mother
calls
them
together
the
chicks
can
hear
the
call
a
distance
of
several
hundred
yards
though
it
is
not
loud
should
the
young
be
unable
to
fly
the
mother
feigns
desperate
lameness
or
death
to
draw
one
away
throwing
herself
at
one
feet
within
two
or
three
yards
rolling
over
on
her
back
kicking
and
gasping
so
as
to
deceive
man
or
beast
they
are
said
to
stay
all
the
year
in
the
woods
hereabouts
taking
shelter
in
dense
tufted
branches
of
fir
and
yellow
pine
during
snowstorms
and
feeding
on
the
young
buds
of
these
trees
their
legs
are
feathered
down
to
their
toes
and
i
have
never
heard
of
their
suffering
in
any
sort
of
weather
able
to
live
on
pine
and
fir
buds
they
are
forever
independent
in
the
matter
of
food
which
troubles
so
many
of
us
and
controls
our
movements
gladly
if
i
could
i
would
live
forever
on
pine
buds
however
full
of
turpentine
and
pitch
for
the
sake
of
this
grand
independence
just
to
think
of
our
sufferings
last
month
merely
for
flour
man
seems
to
have
more
difficulty
in
gaining
food
than
any
other
of
the
lord
creatures
for
many
in
towns
it
is
a
consuming
lifelong
struggle
for
others
the
danger
of
coming
to
want
is
so
great
the
deadly
habit
of
endless
hoarding
for
the
future
is
formed
which
smothers
all
real
life
and
is
continued
long
after
every
reasonable
need
has
been
on
mount
hoffman
i
saw
a
curious
bird
that
seemed
half
woodpecker
half
magpie
or
crow
it
screams
something
like
a
crow
but
flies
like
a
woodpecker
and
has
a
long
straight
bill
with
which
i
saw
it
opening
the
cones
of
the
mountain
and
pines
it
seems
to
keep
to
the
heights
though
no
doubt
it
comes
down
for
shelter
during
winter
if
not
for
food
so
far
as
food
is
concerned
these
i
guess
can
glean
nuts
enough
even
in
winter
from
the
different
kinds
of
conifers
for
always
there
are
a
few
that
have
been
unable
to
fly
out
of
the
cones
and
remain
for
hungry
winter
gleaners
chapter
vii
a
strange
experience
clouds
and
showers
about
the
same
as
yesterday
sketching
all
day
on
the
north
dome
until
four
or
five
in
the
afternoon
when
as
i
was
busily
employed
thinking
only
of
the
glorious
yosemite
landscape
trying
to
draw
every
tree
and
every
line
and
feature
of
the
rocks
i
was
suddenly
and
without
warning
possessed
with
the
notion
that
my
friend
professor
butler
of
the
state
university
of
wisconsin
was
below
me
in
the
valley
and
i
jumped
up
full
of
the
idea
of
meeting
him
with
almost
as
much
startling
excitement
as
if
he
had
suddenly
touched
me
to
make
me
look
up
leaving
my
work
without
the
slightest
deliberation
i
ran
down
the
western
slope
of
the
dome
and
along
the
brink
of
the
valley
wall
looking
for
a
way
to
the
bottom
until
i
came
to
a
side
ca単on
which
judging
by
its
apparently
continuous
growth
of
trees
and
bushes
i
thought
might
afford
a
practical
way
into
the
valley
and
immediately
began
to
make
the
descent
late
as
it
was
as
if
drawn
irresistibly
but
after
a
little
common
sense
stopped
me
and
explained
that
it
would
be
long
after
dark
ere
i
could
possibly
reach
the
hotel
that
the
visitors
would
be
asleep
that
nobody
would
know
me
that
i
had
no
money
in
my
pockets
and
moreover
was
without
a
coat
i
therefore
compelled
myself
to
stop
and
finally
succeeded
in
reasoning
myself
out
of
the
notion
of
seeking
my
friend
in
the
dark
whose
presence
i
only
felt
in
a
strange
telepathic
way
i
succeeded
in
dragging
myself
back
through
the
woods
to
camp
never
for
a
moment
wavering
however
in
my
determination
to
go
down
to
him
next
morning
this
i
think
is
the
most
unexplainable
notion
that
ever
struck
me
had
some
one
whispered
in
my
ear
while
i
sat
on
the
dome
where
i
had
spent
so
many
days
that
professor
butler
was
in
the
valley
i
could
not
have
been
more
surprised
and
startled
when
i
was
leaving
the
university
he
said
now
john
i
want
to
hold
you
in
sight
and
watch
your
career
promise
to
write
me
at
least
once
a
year
i
received
a
letter
from
him
in
july
at
our
first
camp
in
the
hollow
written
in
may
in
which
he
said
that
he
might
possibly
visit
california
some
time
this
summer
and
therefore
hoped
to
meet
me
but
inasmuch
as
he
named
no
and
gave
no
directions
as
to
the
course
he
would
probably
follow
and
as
i
should
be
in
the
wilderness
all
summer
i
had
not
the
slightest
hope
of
seeing
him
and
all
thought
of
the
matter
had
vanished
from
my
mind
until
this
afternoon
when
he
seemed
to
be
wafted
bodily
almost
against
my
face
well
i
shall
see
for
reasonable
or
unreasonable
i
feel
i
must
go
had
a
wonderful
day
found
professor
butler
as
the
finds
the
pole
so
last
evening
telepathy
transcendental
revelation
or
whatever
else
it
may
be
called
was
true
for
strange
to
say
he
had
just
entered
the
valley
by
way
of
the
coulterville
trail
and
was
coming
up
the
valley
past
el
capitan
when
his
presence
struck
me
had
he
then
looked
toward
the
north
dome
with
a
good
glass
when
it
first
came
in
sight
he
might
have
seen
me
jump
up
from
my
work
and
run
toward
him
this
seems
the
one
marvel
of
my
life
of
the
kind
called
supernatural
for
absorbed
in
glad
nature
second
sight
ghost
stories
have
never
interested
me
since
boyhood
seeming
comparatively
useless
and
infinitely
less
wonderful
than
nature
open
harmonious
songful
sunny
everyday
beauty
this
morning
when
i
thought
of
having
to
appear
among
tourists
at
a
hotel
i
was
troubled
because
i
had
no
suitable
clothes
and
at
best
am
desperately
bashful
and
shy
i
was
determined
to
go
however
to
see
my
old
friend
after
two
years
among
strangers
got
on
a
clean
pair
of
overalls
a
cashmere
shirt
and
a
sort
of
jacket
the
best
my
camp
wardrobe
afforded
tied
my
notebook
on
my
belt
and
strode
away
on
my
strange
journey
followed
by
carlo
i
made
my
way
though
the
gap
discovered
last
evening
which
proved
to
be
indian
ca単on
there
was
no
trail
in
it
and
the
rocks
and
brush
were
so
rough
that
carlo
frequently
called
me
back
to
help
him
down
precipitous
places
emerging
from
the
ca単on
shadows
i
found
a
man
making
hay
on
one
of
the
meadows
and
asked
him
whether
professor
butler
was
in
the
valley
i
do
know
he
replied
but
you
can
easily
find
out
at
the
hotel
there
are
but
few
visitors
in
the
valley
just
now
a
small
party
came
in
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
heard
some
one
called
professor
butler
or
butterfield
or
some
name
like
that
illustration
vernal
falls
yosemite
national
in
front
of
the
gloomy
hotel
i
found
a
tourist
party
adjusting
their
fishing
tackle
they
all
stared
at
me
in
silent
wonderment
as
if
i
had
been
seen
dropping
down
through
the
trees
from
the
clouds
mostly
i
suppose
on
account
of
my
strange
garb
inquiring
for
the
office
i
was
told
it
was
locked
and
that
the
landlord
was
away
but
i
might
find
the
landlady
hutchings
in
the
parlor
i
entered
in
a
sad
state
of
embarrassment
and
after
i
had
waited
in
the
big
empty
room
and
knocked
at
several
doors
the
landlady
at
length
appeared
and
in
reply
to
my
question
said
she
rather
thought
professor
butler
in
the
valley
but
to
make
sure
she
would
bring
the
register
from
the
office
among
the
names
of
the
last
arrivals
i
soon
discovered
the
familiar
handwriting
at
the
sight
of
which
bashfulness
vanished
and
having
learned
that
his
party
had
gone
up
the
valley
probably
to
the
vernal
and
nevada
falls
i
pushed
on
in
glad
pursuit
my
heart
now
sure
of
its
prey
in
less
than
an
hour
i
reached
the
head
of
the
nevada
ca単on
at
the
vernal
fall
and
just
outside
of
the
spray
discovered
a
gentleman
who
like
everybody
else
i
have
seen
regarded
me
curiously
as
i
approached
when
i
made
bold
to
inquire
if
he
knew
where
professor
butler
was
he
seemed
yet
more
curious
to
know
what
could
possibly
have
happened
that
required
a
messenger
for
the
professor
and
instead
of
answering
my
question
he
asked
with
military
sharpness
who
wants
him
i
want
him
i
replied
with
equal
sharpness
why
do
know
him
yes
i
said
do
know
him
astonished
that
any
one
in
the
mountains
could
possibly
know
professor
butler
and
find
him
as
soon
as
he
had
reached
the
valley
he
came
down
to
meet
the
strange
mountaineer
on
equal
terms
and
courteously
replied
yes
i
know
professor
butler
very
well
i
am
general
alvord
and
we
were
fellow
students
in
rutland
vermont
long
ago
when
we
were
both
young
but
where
is
he
now
i
persisted
cutting
short
his
story
he
has
gone
beyond
the
falls
with
a
companion
to
try
to
climb
that
big
rock
the
top
of
which
you
see
from
here
his
guide
now
volunteered
the
information
that
it
was
the
liberty
cap
professor
butler
and
his
companion
had
gone
to
climb
and
that
if
i
waited
at
the
head
of
the
fall
i
should
be
sure
to
find
them
on
their
way
down
i
therefore
climbed
the
ladders
alongside
the
vernal
fall
and
was
pushing
forward
determined
to
go
to
the
top
of
liberty
cap
rock
in
my
hurry
rather
than
wait
if
i
should
not
meet
my
friend
sooner
so
at
times
may
one
be
to
see
a
friend
in
the
flesh
however
happily
full
and
one
life
may
be
i
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
however
above
the
brow
of
the
vernal
fall
when
i
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
brush
and
rocks
half
erect
groping
his
way
his
sleeves
rolled
up
vest
open
hat
in
his
hand
evidently
very
hot
and
tired
when
he
saw
me
coming
he
sat
down
on
a
boulder
to
wipe
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
and
neck
and
taking
me
for
one
of
the
valley
guides
he
inquired
the
way
to
the
fall
ladders
i
pointed
out
the
path
marked
with
little
piles
of
stones
on
seeing
which
he
called
his
companion
saying
that
the
way
was
found
but
he
did
not
yet
recognize
me
then
i
stood
directly
in
front
of
him
looked
him
in
the
face
and
held
out
my
hand
he
thought
i
was
offering
to
assist
him
in
rising
never
mind
he
said
then
i
said
professor
butler
do
you
know
me
i
think
not
he
replied
but
catching
my
eye
sudden
recognition
followed
and
astonishment
that
i
should
have
found
him
just
when
he
was
lost
in
the
brush
and
did
not
know
that
i
was
within
hundreds
of
miles
of
him
john
muir
john
muir
where
have
you
come
from
then
i
told
him
the
story
of
my
feeling
his
presence
when
he
entered
the
valley
last
evening
when
he
was
four
or
five
miles
distant
as
i
sat
sketching
on
the
north
dome
this
of
course
only
made
him
wonder
the
more
below
the
foot
of
the
vernal
fall
the
guide
was
waiting
with
his
and
i
walked
along
the
trail
chatting
all
the
way
back
to
the
hotel
talking
of
school
days
friends
in
madison
of
the
students
how
each
had
prospered
ever
and
anon
gazing
at
the
stupendous
rocks
about
us
now
growing
indistinct
in
the
gloaming
and
again
quoting
from
the
poets
a
rare
ramble
it
was
late
ere
we
reached
the
hotel
and
general
alvord
was
waiting
the
professor
arrival
for
dinner
when
i
was
introduced
he
seemed
yet
more
astonished
than
the
professor
at
my
descent
from
cloudland
and
going
straight
to
my
friend
without
knowing
in
any
ordinary
way
that
he
was
even
in
california
they
had
come
on
direct
from
the
east
had
not
yet
visited
any
of
their
friends
in
the
state
and
considered
themselves
undiscoverable
as
we
sat
at
dinner
the
general
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
looking
down
the
table
thus
introduced
me
to
the
dozen
guests
or
so
including
the
staring
fisherman
mentioned
above
this
man
you
know
came
down
out
of
these
huge
trackless
mountains
you
know
to
find
his
friend
professor
butler
here
the
very
day
he
arrived
and
how
did
he
know
he
was
here
he
just
felt
him
he
says
this
is
the
queerest
case
of
scotch
farsightedness
i
ever
heard
of
etc
while
my
friend
quoted
shakespeare
more
things
in
heaven
and
earth
horatio
than
are
dreamt
of
in
your
philosophy
as
the
sun
ere
he
has
risen
sometimes
paints
his
image
in
the
firmament
so
the
shadows
of
events
precede
the
events
and
in
already
walks
had
a
long
conversation
after
dinner
over
madison
days
the
professor
wants
me
to
promise
to
go
with
him
sometime
on
a
camping
trip
in
the
hawaiian
islands
while
i
tried
to
get
him
to
go
back
with
me
to
camp
in
the
high
sierra
but
he
says
not
now
he
must
not
leave
the
general
and
i
was
surprised
to
learn
they
are
to
leave
the
valley
or
next
day
i
glad
i
not
great
enough
to
be
missed
in
the
busy
world
it
seemed
strange
to
sleep
in
a
paltry
hotel
chamber
after
the
spacious
magnificence
and
luxury
of
the
starry
sky
and
silver
fir
grove
bade
farewell
to
my
friend
and
the
general
the
old
soldier
was
very
kind
and
an
interesting
talker
he
told
me
long
stories
of
the
florida
seminole
war
in
which
he
took
part
and
invited
me
to
visit
him
in
omaha
calling
carlo
i
scrambled
home
through
the
indian
ca単on
gate
rejoicing
pitying
the
poor
professor
and
general
bound
by
clocks
almanacs
orders
duties
and
compelled
to
dwell
with
lowland
care
and
dust
and
din
where
nature
is
covered
and
her
voice
smothered
while
the
poor
insignificant
wanderer
enjoys
the
freedom
and
glory
of
wilderness
apart
from
the
human
interest
of
my
visit
i
greatly
enjoyed
yosemite
which
i
had
visited
only
once
before
having
spent
eight
days
last
spring
in
rambling
amid
its
rocks
and
waters
wherever
we
go
in
the
mountains
or
indeed
in
any
of
god
wild
fields
we
find
more
than
we
seek
descending
four
thousand
feet
in
a
few
hours
we
enter
a
new
world
climate
plants
sounds
inhabitants
and
scenery
all
new
or
changed
near
camp
the
goldcup
oak
forms
sheets
of
chaparral
on
top
of
which
we
may
make
our
beds
going
down
the
indian
ca単on
we
observe
this
little
bush
changing
by
regular
gradations
to
a
large
bush
to
a
small
tree
and
then
larger
until
on
the
rocky
taluses
near
the
bottom
of
the
valley
we
find
it
developed
into
a
broad
gnarled
picturesque
tree
from
four
to
eight
feet
in
diameter
and
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
innumerable
are
the
forms
of
water
displayed
every
gliding
reach
cascade
and
fall
has
characters
of
its
own
had
a
good
view
of
the
vernal
and
nevada
two
of
the
main
falls
of
the
valley
less
than
a
mile
apart
and
offering
striking
differences
in
voice
form
color
etc
the
vernal
four
hundred
feet
high
and
about
or
eighty
feet
wide
drops
smoothly
over
a
precipice
and
forms
a
superb
apron
of
embroidery
green
and
white
slightly
folded
and
fluted
maintaining
this
form
nearly
to
the
bottom
where
it
is
suddenly
veiled
in
billows
of
spray
and
mist
in
which
the
afternoon
sunbeams
play
with
ravishing
beauty
of
rainbow
colors
the
nevada
is
white
from
its
first
appearance
as
it
leaps
out
into
the
freedom
of
the
air
at
the
head
it
presents
a
twisted
appearance
by
an
overfolding
of
the
current
from
striking
on
the
side
of
its
channel
just
before
the
first
free
leap
is
made
about
two
thirds
of
the
way
down
the
hurrying
throng
of
masses
glance
on
an
inclined
part
of
the
face
of
the
precipice
and
are
beaten
into
yet
whiter
foam
greatly
expanded
and
sent
bounding
outward
making
an
indescribably
glorious
show
especially
when
the
afternoon
sunshine
is
pouring
into
it
in
this
fall
one
of
the
most
wonderful
in
the
world
the
water
does
not
seem
to
be
under
the
dominion
of
ordinary
laws
but
rather
as
if
it
were
a
living
creature
full
of
the
strength
of
the
mountains
and
their
huge
wild
joy
from
beneath
heavy
throbbing
blasts
of
spray
the
broken
river
is
seen
emerging
in
ragged
strips
these
are
speedily
gathered
into
a
roaring
torrent
showing
that
the
young
river
is
still
gloriously
alive
on
it
goes
shouting
roaring
exulting
in
its
strength
passes
through
a
gorge
with
sublime
display
of
energy
then
suddenly
expands
on
a
gently
inclined
pavement
down
which
it
rushes
in
thin
sheets
and
folds
of
into
a
quiet
pool
emerald
pool
as
it
is
called
a
a
period
separating
two
grand
sentences
resting
here
long
enough
to
part
with
its
and
gray
mixtures
of
air
it
glides
quietly
to
the
verge
of
the
vernal
precipice
in
a
broad
sheet
and
makes
its
new
display
in
the
vernal
fall
then
more
rapids
and
rock
tossings
down
the
ca単on
shaded
by
live
oak
douglas
spruce
fir
maple
and
dogwood
it
receives
the
illilouette
tributary
and
makes
a
long
sweep
out
into
the
level
valley
to
join
the
other
streams
which
like
itself
have
danced
and
sung
their
way
down
from
snowy
heights
to
form
the
main
merced
the
river
of
mercy
but
of
this
there
is
no
end
and
life
when
one
thinks
of
it
is
so
short
never
mind
one
day
in
the
midst
of
these
divine
glories
is
well
worth
living
and
toiling
and
starving
for
before
parting
with
professor
butler
he
gave
me
a
book
and
i
gave
him
one
of
my
pencil
sketches
for
his
little
son
henry
who
is
a
favorite
of
mine
he
used
to
make
many
visits
to
my
room
when
i
was
a
student
never
shall
i
forget
his
patriotic
speeches
for
the
union
mounted
on
a
tall
stool
when
he
was
only
six
years
old
it
seems
strange
that
visitors
to
yosemite
should
be
so
little
influenced
by
its
novel
grandeur
as
if
their
eyes
were
bandaged
and
their
ears
stopped
most
of
those
i
saw
yesterday
were
looking
down
as
if
wholly
unconscious
of
anything
going
on
about
them
while
the
sublime
rocks
were
trembling
with
the
tones
of
the
mighty
chanting
congregation
of
waters
gathered
from
all
the
mountains
round
about
making
music
that
might
draw
angels
out
of
heaven
yet
even
people
were
fixing
bits
of
worms
on
bent
pieces
of
wire
to
catch
trout
sport
they
called
it
should
try
to
pass
the
time
fishing
in
baptismal
fonts
while
dull
sermons
were
being
preached
the
sport
might
not
be
so
bad
but
to
play
in
the
yosemite
temple
seeking
pleasure
in
the
pain
of
fishes
struggling
for
their
lives
while
god
himself
is
preaching
his
sublimest
water
and
stone
sermons
illustration
happy
isles
yosemite
national
now
i
back
at
the
and
can
not
help
thinking
about
my
recognition
of
my
friend
presence
in
the
valley
while
he
was
four
or
five
miles
away
and
while
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
that
he
was
not
thousands
of
miles
away
it
seems
supernatural
but
only
because
it
is
not
understood
anyhow
it
seems
silly
to
make
so
much
of
it
while
the
natural
and
common
is
more
truly
marvelous
and
mysterious
than
the
supernatural
indeed
most
of
the
miracles
we
hear
of
are
infinitely
less
wonderful
than
the
commonest
of
natural
phenomena
when
fairly
seen
perhaps
the
invisible
rays
that
struck
me
while
i
sat
at
work
on
the
dome
are
something
like
those
which
attract
and
repel
people
at
first
sight
concerning
which
so
much
nonsense
has
been
written
the
worst
apparent
effect
of
these
mysterious
odd
things
is
blindness
to
all
that
is
divinely
common
hawthorne
i
fancy
could
weave
one
of
his
weird
romances
out
of
this
little
telepathic
episode
the
one
strange
marvel
of
my
life
probably
replacing
my
good
old
professor
by
an
attractive
woman
we
were
awakened
this
morning
before
daybreak
by
the
furious
barking
of
carlo
and
jack
and
the
sound
of
stampeding
sheep
billy
fled
from
his
punk
bed
to
the
fire
and
refused
to
stir
into
the
darkness
to
try
to
gather
the
scattered
flock
or
ascertain
the
nature
of
the
disturbance
it
was
a
bear
attack
as
we
afterward
learned
and
i
suppose
little
was
gained
by
attempting
to
do
anything
before
daylight
nevertheless
being
anxious
to
know
what
was
up
carlo
and
i
groped
our
way
through
the
woods
guided
by
the
rustling
sound
made
by
fragments
of
the
flock
not
fearing
the
bear
for
i
knew
that
the
runaways
would
go
from
their
enemy
as
far
as
possible
and
carlo
nose
was
also
to
be
depended
upon
about
half
a
mile
east
of
the
corral
we
overtook
twenty
or
thirty
of
the
flock
and
succeeded
in
driving
them
back
then
turning
to
the
westward
we
traced
another
band
of
fugitives
and
got
them
back
to
the
flock
after
daybreak
i
discovered
the
remains
of
a
sheep
carcass
still
warm
showing
that
bruin
must
have
been
enjoying
his
early
mutton
breakfast
while
i
was
seeking
the
runaways
he
had
eaten
about
half
of
it
six
dead
sheep
lay
in
the
corral
evidently
smothered
by
the
crowding
and
piling
up
of
the
flock
against
the
side
of
the
corral
wall
when
the
bear
entered
making
a
wide
circuit
of
the
camp
carlo
and
i
discovered
a
third
band
of
fugitives
and
drove
them
back
to
camp
we
also
discovered
another
dead
sheep
half
eaten
showing
there
had
been
two
of
the
shaggy
freebooters
at
this
early
breakfast
they
were
easily
traced
they
had
each
caught
a
sheep
jumped
over
the
corral
fence
with
them
carrying
them
as
a
cat
carries
a
mouse
laid
them
at
the
foot
of
fir
trees
a
hundred
yards
or
so
back
from
the
corral
and
eaten
their
fill
after
breakfast
i
set
out
to
seek
more
of
the
lost
and
found
at
a
considerable
distance
from
camp
in
the
afternoon
i
succeeded
with
carlo
help
in
getting
them
back
to
the
flock
i
do
know
whether
all
are
together
again
or
not
i
shall
make
a
big
fire
this
evening
and
keep
watch
when
i
asked
billy
why
he
made
his
bed
against
the
corral
in
rotten
wood
when
so
many
better
places
offered
he
replied
that
he
wished
to
be
as
near
the
sheep
as
possible
in
case
bears
should
attack
them
now
that
the
bears
have
come
he
has
moved
his
bed
to
the
far
side
of
the
camp
and
seems
afraid
that
he
may
be
mistaken
for
a
sheep
this
has
been
mostly
a
sheep
day
and
of
course
studies
have
been
interrupted
nevertheless
the
walk
through
the
gloom
of
the
woods
before
the
dawn
was
worth
while
and
i
have
learned
something
about
these
noble
bears
their
tracks
are
very
telling
and
so
are
their
breakfasts
scarce
a
trace
of
clouds
and
of
course
our
ordinary
midday
thunder
is
wanting
enjoyed
the
grand
illumination
of
the
camp
grove
last
night
from
the
fire
we
made
to
frighten
the
bears
compensation
for
loss
of
sleep
and
sheep
the
noble
pillars
of
verdure
vividly
aglow
seemed
to
shoot
into
the
sky
like
the
flames
that
lighted
them
nevertheless
one
of
the
bears
paid
us
another
visit
as
if
more
attracted
than
repelled
by
the
fire
climbed
into
the
corral
killed
a
sheep
and
made
off
with
it
without
being
seen
while
still
another
was
lost
by
trampling
and
suffocation
against
the
side
of
the
corral
now
that
our
mutton
has
been
tasted
i
suppose
it
will
be
difficult
to
put
a
stop
to
the
ravages
of
these
freebooters
the
don
arrived
from
the
lowlands
with
provisions
and
a
letter
on
learning
the
losses
he
had
sustained
he
determined
to
move
the
flock
at
once
to
the
upper
tuolumne
region
saying
that
the
bears
would
be
sure
to
visit
the
camp
every
night
as
long
as
we
stayed
and
that
no
fire
or
noise
we
might
make
would
avail
to
frighten
them
no
clouds
save
a
few
thin
lustrous
touches
on
the
eastern
horizon

they
do

glorious

lifts
above

look

arriving
early
i
took
a
walk
on
the

along
the

climbed
the
magnificent
mountain
rock
at
the
east
end
of
the
lake
now
shining
in
the
late
afternoon
light
almost
every
yard
of
its
surface
shows
the
scoring
and
polishing
action
of
a
great
glacier
that
enveloped
it
and
swept
heavily
over
its
summit
though
it
is
about
two
thousand
feet
high
above
the
lake
and
ten
thousand
above
this
majestic
ancient

from
the
eastward
as
the
scoring

crushing
of
the

shows

in
some
places
is
still
grooved
and
polished
the
lapping
of
the
waves
and
their
disintegrating
action
have
not
as
yet
obliterated
even
the
superficial
marks
of
glaciation
in
climbing
the
steepest
polished
places
i
had
to
take
off
shoes
and
stockings
a
fine
region
this
for
study
of
glacial

in
i
found

charming

arctic

of
winters
the
view
of
the
lake
from
the
top
is
i
think
the
best
of
all
there
is
another
rock
more
striking
in
form
than
this
standing
isolated
at
the
head
of
the
lake
but
it
is
not
more
than
half
as
high
it
is
a
knob
or
knot
of
burnished
granite
perhaps
about
a
thousand
feet
high
apparently
as
flawless
and
strong
in
structure
as
a
pebble

probably
owes
its
existence
to
the
superior

grandeur
refined
and
doubled
a
marvelously
impressive
picture
that
seemed
to
belong
more
to
heaven
than
earth
i
went
ahead
of
the
flock
and
crossed
over
the
divide
between
the
merced
and
tuolumne
basins
the
gap
between
the
east
end
of
the
hoffman
spur
and
the
mass
of
mountain
rocks
about
cathedral
peak
though
roughened
by
ridges
and
waving
folds
seems
to
be
one
of
the
channels
of
a
broad
ancient
glacier
that
came
from
the
mountains
on
the
summit
of
the
range
in
crossing
this
divide
the
made
an
ascent
of
about
five
hundred
feet
from
the
tuolumne
meadows
this
entire
region
must
have
been
overswept
by
ice
from
the
top
of
the
divide
and
also
from
the
big
tuolumne
meadows
the
wonderful
mountain
called
cathedral
peak
is
in
sight
from
every
point
of
view
it
shows
marked
individuality
it
is
a
majestic
temple
of
one
stone
hewn
from
the
living
rock
and
adorned
with
spires
and
pinnacles
in
regular
cathedral
style
the
dwarf
pines
on
the
roof
look
like
mosses
i
hope
some
time
to
climb
to
it
to
say
my
prayers
and
hear
the
stone
sermons
the
big
tuolumne
meadows
are
flowery
lawns
lying
along
the
south
fork
of
the
tuolumne
river
at
a
height
of
about
hundred
to
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
partially
separated
by
forests
and
bars
of
glaciated
granite
here
the
mountains
seem
to
have
been
cleared
away
or
set
back
so
that
views
may
be
had
in
every
direction
the
upper
end
of
the
series
lies
at
the
base
of
mount
lyell
the
lower
below
the
east
end
of
the
hoffman
range
so
the
length
must
be
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
they
vary
in
width
from
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
perhaps
three
quarters
and
a
good
many
branch
meadows
put
out
along
the
banks
of
the
tributary
streams
this
is
the
most
spacious
and
delightful
high
i
have
yet
seen
the
air
is
keen
and
bracing
yet
warm
during
the
day
and
though
lying
high
in
the
sky
the
surrounding
mountains
are
so
much
higher
one
feels
protected
as
if
in
a
grand
hall
mounts
dana
and
gibbs
massive
red
mountains
perhaps
thirteen
thousand
feet
high
or
more
bound
the
view
on
the
east
the
cathedral
and
unicorn
peaks
with
many
nameless
peaks
on
the
south
the
hoffman
range
on
the
west
and
a
number
of
peaks
unnamed
as
far
as
i
know
on
the
north
one
of
these
last
is
much
like
the
cathedral
the
grass
of
the
meadows
is
mostly
fine
and
silky
with
exceedingly
slender
leaves
making
a
close
sod
above
which
the
panicles
of
minute
purple
flowers
seem
to
float
in
airy
misty
lightness
while
the
sod
is
enriched
with
at
least
three
species
of
gentian
and
as
many
or
more
of
orthocarpus
potentilla
ivesia
solidago
pentstemon
with
their
gay
colors
purple
blue
yellow
and
red
all
of
which
i
may
know
better
ere
long
a
central
camp
will
probably
be
made
in
this
region
from
which
i
hope
to
make
long
excursions
into
the
surrounding
mountains
on
the
return
trip
i
met
the
flock
about
three
miles
east
of
lake
tenaya
here
we
camped
for
the
night
near
a
small
lake
lying
on
top
of
the
divide
in
a
clump
of
the
pine
we
are
now
about
nine
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
small
lakes
abound
in
all
sorts
of
situations
on
ridges
along
mountain
sides
and
in
piles
of
moraine
boulders
most
of
them
mere
pools
only
in
those
ca単ons
of
the
larger
streams
at
the
foot
of
declivities
where
the
down
thrust
of
the
glaciers
was
heaviest
do
we
find
lakes
of
considerable
size
and
depth
how
grateful
a
task
it
would
be
to
trace
them
all
and
study
them
how
pure
their
waters
are
clear
as
crystal
in
polished
stone
basins
none
of
them
so
far
as
i
have
seen
have
fishes
i
suppose
on
account
of
falls
making
them
inaccessible
yet
one
would
think
their
eggs
might
get
into
these
lakes
by
some
chance
or
other
on
ducks
feet
for
example
or
in
their
mouths
or
in
their
crops
as
some
plant
seeds
are
distributed
nature
has
so
many
ways
of
doing
such
things
how
did
the
frogs
found
in
all
the
bogs
and
pools
and
lakes
however
high
manage
to
get
up
these
mountains
surely
not
by
jumping
such
excursions
through
miles
of
dry
brush
and
boulders
would
be
very
hard
on
frogs
perhaps
their
stringy
gelatinous
spawn
is
occasionally
entangled
or
glued
on
the
feet
of
water
birds
anyhow
they
are
here
and
in
hearty
health
and
voice
i
like
their
cheery
tronk
and
crink
they
take
the
place
of
songbirds
at
a
pinch
another
of
those
charming
exhilarating
days
that
make
the
blood
dance
and
excite
nerve
currents
that
render
one
unweariable
and
immortal
had
another
view
of
the
broad
divide
and
gazed
again
and
again
at
the
sierra
temple
and
the
great
red
mountains
east
of
the
meadows
we
are
camped
near
the
soda
springs
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
a
hard
time
we
had
getting
the
sheep
across
they
were
driven
into
a
horseshoe
bend
and
fairly
crowded
off
the
bank
they
seemed
willing
to
suffer
death
rather
than
risk
getting
wet
though
they
swim
well
enough
when
they
have
to
why
sheep
should
be
so
unreasonably
afraid
of
water
i
do
know
but
they
do
fear
it
as
soon
as
they
are
born
and
perhaps
before
i
once
saw
a
lamb
only
a
few
hours
old
approach
a
shallow
stream
about
two
feet
wide
and
an
inch
deep
after
it
had
walked
only
about
a
hundred
yards
on
its
life
journey
all
the
flock
to
which
it
belonged
had
crossed
this
stream
and
as
the
mother
and
her
lamb
were
the
last
to
cross
i
had
a
good
opportunity
to
observe
them
as
soon
as
the
flock
was
out
of
the
way
the
anxious
mother
crossed
over
and
called
the
youngster
it
walked
cautiously
to
the
brink
gazed
at
the
water
bleated
piteously
and
refused
to
venture
the
patient
mother
went
back
to
it
again
and
again
to
encourage
it
but
long
without
avail
like
the
pilgrim
on
jordan
stormy
bank
it
feared
to
launch
away
at
length
gathering
its
trembling
inexperienced
legs
for
the
mighty
effort
throwing
up
its
head
as
if
it
knew
all
about
drowning
and
was
anxious
to
keep
its
nose
above
water
it
made
the
tremendous
leap
and
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
it
seemed
astonished
to
find
that
instead
of
sinking
over
head
and
ears
only
its
toes
were
wet
gazed
at
the
shining
water
a
few
seconds
and
then
sprang
to
the
shore
safe
and
dry
through
the
dreadful
adventure
all
kinds
of
wild
sheep
are
mountain
animals
and
their
descendants
dread
of
water
is
not
easily
accounted
for
fine
shining
weather
with
a
ten
minutes
noon
thunderstorm
and
rain
rambling
all
day
getting
acquainted
with
the
region
north
of
the
river
found
a
small
lake
and
many
charming
glacier
meadows
embosomed
in
an
extensive
forest
of
the
pine
the
forest
is
growing
on
broad
almost
continuous
deposits
of
moraine
material
is
remarkably
even
in
its
growth
and
the
trees
are
much
closer
together
than
in
any
of
the
fir
or
pine
woods
farther
down
the
range
the
evenness
of
the
growth
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
trees
are
all
of
the
same
age
or
nearly
so
this
regularity
has
probably
been
in
great
part
the
result
of
fire
i
saw
several
large
patches
and
strips
of
dead
bleached
spars
the
ground
beneath
them
covered
with
a
young
even
growth
fire
can
run
in
these
woods
not
only
because
the
thin
bark
of
the
trees
is
dripping
with
resin
but
because
the
growth
is
close
and
the
comparatively
rich
soil
produces
good
crops
of
tall
grasses
on
which
fire
can
travel
even
when
the
weather
is
calm
besides
these
patches
there
are
a
good
many
fallen
uprooted
trees
here
and
there
some
with
the
bark
and
needles
still
on
as
if
they
had
lately
been
blown
down
in
some
thunderstorm
blast
saw
a
large
deer
a
buck
with
antlers
like
the
upturned
roots
of
a
fallen
pine
after
a
long
ramble
through
the
dense
encumbered
woods
i
emerged
upon
a
smooth
meadow
full
of
sunshine
like
a
lake
of
light
about
a
mile
and
a
half
long
a
quarter
to
half
a
mile
wide
and
bounded
by
tall
arrowy
pines
the
sod
like
that
of
all
the
glacier
meadows
hereabouts
is
made
of
silky
agrostis
and
calamagrostis
chiefly
their
panicles
of
purple
flowers
and
purple
stems
exceedingly
light
and
airy
seem
to
float
above
the
green
plush
of
leaves
like
a
thin
misty
cloud
while
the
sod
is
brightened
by
several
species
of
gentian
potentilla
ivesia
orthocarpus
and
their
corresponding
bees
and
butterflies
all
the
glacier
meadows
are
beautiful
but
few
are
so
perfect
as
this
one
compared
with
it
the
most
carefully
leveled
licked
snipped
artificial
lawns
of
are
coarse
things
i
should
like
to
live
here
always
it
is
so
calm
and
withdrawn
while
open
to
the
universe
in
full
communion
with
everything
good
to
the
north
of
this
glorious
meadow
i
discovered
the
camp
of
some
indian
hunters
their
fire
was
still
burning
but
they
had
not
yet
returned
from
the
chase
from
meadow
to
meadow
every
one
beautiful
beyond
telling
and
from
lake
to
lake
through
groves
and
belts
of
arrowy
trees
i
held
my
way
northward
toward
mount
conness
finding
telling
beauty
everywhere
while
the
encompassing
mountains
were
calling
come
hope
i
may
climb
them
all
the
has
changed
but
little
so
far
with
the
change
in
elevation
clouds
about
glorious
pearly
cumuli
tinted
with
purple
of
ineffable
fineness
of
tone
moved
camp
to
the
side
of
the
glacier
meadow
mentioned
above
to
let
sheep
trample
so
divinely
fine
a
place
seems
barbarous
fortunately
they
prefer
the
succulent
triticum
and
other
woodland
grasses
to
the
silky
species
of
the
meadows
and
therefore
seldom
bite
them
or
set
foot
on
them
illustration
glacier

on
the
headwaters
of
the
tuolumne
feet
above

the
shepherd
and
the
don
can
not
agree
about
methods
of
herding
billy
sets
his
dog
jack
on
the
sheep
far
too
often
so
the
don
thinks
and
after
some
dispute
in
which
the
shepherd
loudly
claimed
the
right
to
dog
the
sheep
as
often
as
he
pleased
he
started
for
the
plains
now
i
suppose
the
care
of
the
sheep
will
fall
on
me
though
delaney
promises
to
do
the
herding
himself
for
a
while
then
return
to
the
lowlands
and
bring
another
shepherd
so
as
to
leave
me
free
to
rove
as
i
like
had
another
rich
ramble
pushed
northward
beyond
the
forests
to
the
head
of
the
general
basin
where
traces
of
glacial
action
are
strikingly
clear
and
interesting
the
recesses
among
the
peaks
look
like
quarries
so
raw
and
fresh
are
the
moraine
chips
and
boulders
that
strew
the
ground
in
nature
glacial
workshops
soon
after
my
return
to
camp
we
received
a
visit
from
an
indian
probably
one
of
the
hunters
whose
camp
i
had
discovered
he
came
from
mono
he
said
with
others
of
his
tribe
to
hunt
deer
one
that
he
had
killed
a
short
distance
from
here
he
was
carrying
on
his
back
its
legs
tied
together
in
an
ornamental
bunch
on
his
forehead
throwing
down
his
burden
he
gazed
stolidly
for
a
few
minutes
in
silent
indian
fashion
then
cut
off
eight
or
ten
pounds
of
venison
for
us
and
begged
a
lill
little
of
everything
he
saw
or
could
think
of
flour
bread
sugar
tobacco
whiskey
needles
etc
we
gave
a
fair
price
for
the
meat
in
flour
and
sugar
and
added
a
few
needles
a
strangely
dirty
and
irregular
life
these
savages
lead
in
this
clean
wilderness
starvation
and
abundance
deathlike
calm
indolence
and
admirable
indefatigable
action
succeeding
each

in

like

two
things
they
have
that
civilized
toilers
might
well
envy
them
pure
air
and
pure

these
go
far
to
cover
and
cure
the
grossness
of

their

is
mostly
good

one
of

an

on

he
left
some
provisions
at
the
portuguese
camp
on
porcupine

near
our
old
yosemite
camp
and
i
set
out
this
morning
with
one
of
the
pack
animals
to
fetch
them
arrived
at
the
porcupine
camp
at
noon
and
might
have
returned
to
the
tuolumne
late
in
the
evening
but
concluded
to
stay
over
night
with
the
portuguese
shepherds
at
their
pressing
invitation
they
had
sad
stories
to
tell
of
losses
from
the
yosemite
bears
and
were
so
discouraged
they
seemed
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
mountains
for
the
bears
came
every
night
and
helped
themselves
to
one
or
several
of
the
flock
in
spite
of
all
their
efforts
to
keep
them
off
i
spent
the
afternoon
in
a
grand
ramble
along
the
yosemite
walls
from
the
highest
of
the
rocks
called
the
three
brothers
i
enjoyed
a
magnificent
view
comprehending
all
the
upper
half
of
the
floor
of
the
valley
and
nearly
all
the
rocks
of
the
walls
on
both
sides
and
at
the
head
with
snowy
peaks
in
the
background
saw
also
the
vernal
and
nevada
falls
a
truly
glorious
picture
rocky
strength
and
permanence
combined
with
beauty
of
plants
frail
and
fine
and
evanescent
water
descending
in
thunder
and
the
same
water
gliding
through
meadows
and
groves
in
gentlest
beauty
this
standpoint
is
about
eight
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
or
four
thousand
feet
above
the
floor
of
the
valley
and
every
tree
though
looking
small
and
feathery
stands
in
admirable
clearness
and
the
shadows
they
cast
are
as
distinct
in
outline
as
if
seen
at
a
distance
of
a
few
yards
they
appeared
even
more
so
no
words
will
ever
describe
the
exquisite
beauty
and
charm
of
this
mountain
park
landscape
garden
at
once
tenderly
beautiful
and
sublime
no
wonder
it
draws
from
all
over
the
world
glacial
action
even
on
this
lofty
summit
is
plainly
displayed
not
only
has
all
the
lovely
valley
now
smiling
in
sunshine
been
filled
to
the
brim
with
ice
but
it
has
been
deeply
overflowed
i
visited
our
old
yosemite
on
the
head
of
indian
creek
and
found
it
fairly
patted
and
smoothed
down
with
the
bears
had
eaten
all
the
sheep
that
were
smothered
in
the
corral
and
some
of
the
grand
animals
must
have
died
for
delaney
before
leaving
camp
put
a
large
quantity
of
poison
in
the
carcasses
all
carry
strychnine
to
kill
coyotes
bears
and
panthers
though
neither
coyotes
nor
panthers
are
at
all
numerous
in
the
upper
mountains
the
little
wolves
are
far
more
numerous
in
the
foothill
region
and
on
the
plains
where
they
find
a
better
supply
of
food
saw

three
brothers
yosemite
national
on
my
return
after
sunset
to
the
portuguese
camp
i
found
the
shepherds
greatly
excited
over
the
behavior
of
the
bears
that
have
learned
to
like
mutton
they
are
getting
worse
and
worse
they
lamented
not
willing
to
wait
decently
until
after
dark
for
their
suppers
they
come
and
kill
and
eat
their
fill
in
broad
daylight
the
evening
before
my
arrival
when
the
two
shepherds
were
leisurely
driving
the
flock
toward
camp
half
an
hour
before
sunset
a
hungry
bear
came
out
of
the
chaparral
within
a
few
yards
of
them
and
shuffled
deliberately
toward
the
flock
portuguese
joe
who
always
carried
a
gun
loaded
with
buckshot
fired
excitedly
threw
down
his
gun
fled
to
the
nearest
suitable
tree
and
climbed
to
a
safe
height
without
waiting
to
see
the
effect
of
his
shot
his
companion
also
ran
but
said
that
he
saw
the
bear
rise
on
its
hind
legs
and
throw
out
its
arms
as
if
feeling
for
somebody
and
then
go
into
the
brush
as
if
wounded
at
another
of
their
camps
in
this
neighborhood
a
bear
with
two
cubs
attacked
the
flock
before
sunset
just
as
they
were
approaching
the
corral
joe
promptly
climbed
a
tree
out
of
danger
while
antone
rebuking
his
companion
for
cowardice
in
abandoning
his
charge
said
that
he
was
not
going
to
let
bears
eat
up
his
sheeps
in
daylight
and
rushed
towards
the
bears
shouting
and
setting
his
dog
on
them
the
frightened
cubs
climbed
a
tree
but
the
mother
ran
to
meet
the
shepherd
and
seemed
anxious
to
fight
antone
stood
astonished
for
a
moment
eyeing
the
oncoming
bear
then
turned
and
fled
closely
pursued
unable
to
reach
a
suitable
tree
for
climbing
he
ran
to
the
camp
and
scrambled
up
to
the
roof
of
the
little
cabin
the
bear
followed
but
did
not
climb
to
the
roof
only
stood
glaring
up
at
him
for
a
few
minutes
threatening
him
and
holding
him
in
mortal
terror
then
went
to
her
cubs
called
them
down
went
to
the
flock
caught
a
sheep
for
supper
and
vanished
in
the
brush
as
soon
as
the
bear
left
the
cabin
the
trembling
antone
begged
joe
to
show
him
a
good
safe
tree
up
which
he
climbed
like
a
sailor
climbing
a
mast
and
remained
as
long
as
he
could
hold
on
the
tree
being
almost
branchless
after
these
disastrous
experiences
the
two
shepherds
chopped
and
gathered
large
piles
of
dry
wood
and
made
a
ring
of
fire
around
the
corral
every
night
while
one
with
a
gun
kept
watch
from
a
comfortable
stage
built
on
a
neighboring
pine
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
corral
this
evening
the
show
made
by
the
circle
of
fire
was
very
fine
bringing
out
the
surrounding
trees
in
most
impressive
relief
and
making
the
thousands
of
sheep
eyes
glow
like
a
glorious
bed
of
diamonds
up
to
the
time
i
went
to
bed
last
night
all
was
quiet
though
we
expected
the
shaggy
freebooters
every
minute
they
did
not
come
till
near
midnight
when
a
pair
walked
boldly
to
the
corral
between
two
of
the
great
fires
climbed
in
killed
two
sheep
and
smothered
ten
while
the
frightened
watcher
in
the
tree
did
not
fire
a
single
shot
saying
that
he
was
afraid
he
might
kill
some
of
the
sheep
for
the
bears
got
into
the
corral
before
he
got
a
good
clear
view
of
them
i
told
the
shepherds
they
should
at
once
move
the
flock
to
another
camp
oh
no
use
no
use
they
lamented
where
we
go
the
bears
go
too
see
my
poor
dead
sheeps
soon
all
dead
no
use
try
another
camp
we
go
down
to
the
plains
and
as
i
afterwards
learned
they
were
driven
out
of
the
mountains
a
month
before
the
usual
time
were
bears
much
more
numerous
and
destructive
the
sheep
would
be
kept
away
altogether
it
seems
strange
that
bears
so
fond
of
all
sorts
of
flesh
running
the
risks
of
guns
and
fires
and
poison
should
never
attack
men
except
in
defense
of
their
young
how
easily
and
safely
a
bear
could
pick
us
up
as
we
lie
asleep
only
wolves
and
tigers
seem
to
have
learned
to
hunt
man
for
food
and
perhaps
sharks
and
crocodiles
mosquitoes
and
other
insects
would
i
suppose
devour
a
helpless
man
in
some
parts
of
the
world
and
so
might
lions
leopards
wolves
hyenas
and
panthers
at
times
if
pressed
by
hunger
but
under
ordinary
circumstances
perhaps
only
the
tiger
among
land
animals
may
be
said
to
be
a
unless
we
add
man
himself
clouds
as
usual
about
another
glorious
sierra
day
warm
crisp
fragrant
and
clear
many
of
the
flowering
plants
have
gone
to
seed
but
many
others
are
unfolding
their
petals
every
day
and
the
firs
and
pines
are
more
fragrant
than
ever
their
seeds
are
nearly
ripe
and
will
soon
be
flying
in
the
merriest
flocks
that
ever
spread
a
wing
on
the
way
back
to
our
tuolumne
camp
i
enjoyed
the
scenery
if
possible
more
than
when
it
first
came
to
view
every
feature
already
seems
familiar
as
if
i
had
lived
here
always
i
never
weary
gazing
at
the
wonderful
cathedral
it
has
more
individual
character
than
any
other
rock
or
mountain
i
ever
saw
excepting
perhaps
the
yosemite
south
dome
the
forests
too
seem
kindly
familiar
and
the
lakes
and
meadows
and
glad
singing
streams
i
should
like
to
dwell
with
them
forever
here
with
bread
and
water
i
should
be
content
even
if
not
allowed
to
roam
and
climb
tethered
to
a
stake
or
tree
in
some
meadow
or
grove
even
then
i
should
be
content
forever
bathed
in
such
beauty
watching
the
expressions
ever
varying
on
the
faces
of
the
mountains
watching
the
stars
which
here
have
a
glory
that
the
lowlander
never
dreams
of
watching
the
circling
seasons
listening
to
the
songs
of
the
waters
and
winds
and
birds
would
be
endless
pleasure
and
what
glorious
cloudlands
i
should
see
storms
and
calms
a
new
heaven
and
a
new
earth
every
day
aye
and
new
inhabitants
and
how
many
visitors
i
should
have
i
feel
sure
i
should
not
have
one
dull
moment
and
why
should
this
appear
extravagant
it
is
only
common
sense
a
sign
of
health
genuine
natural
health
one
would
be
at
an
endless
godful
play
and

and
acting
and
scenery
and

chapter
ix
bloody
ca単on
and
mono
lake
have
just
returned
from
a
fine
wild
excursion
across
the
range
to
mono
lake
by
way
of
the
mono
or
bloody
ca単on
pass
delaney
has
been
good
to
me
all
summer
lending
a
helping
sympathizing
hand
at
every
opportunity
as
if
my
wild
notions
and
rambles
and
studies
were
his
own
he
is
one
of
those
remarkable
california
men
who
have
been
overflowed
and
denuded
and
remodeled
by
the
excitements
of
the
gold
fields
like
the
sierra
landscapes
by
grinding
ice
bringing
the
harder
bosses
and
ridges
of
character
into
relief
a
tall
lean
irishman
educated
for
a
priest
in
maynooth
college
lots
of
good
in
him
shining
out
now
and
then
in
this
mountain
light
recognizing
my
love
of
wild
places
he
told
me
one
evening
that
i
ought
to
go
through
bloody
ca単on
for
he
was
sure
i
should
find
it
wild
enough
he
had
not
been
there
himself
he
said
but
had
heard
many
of
his
mining
friends
speak
of
it
as
the
wildest
of
all
the
sierra
passes
of
course
i
was
glad
to
go
it
lies
just
to
the
east
of
our
camp
and
swoops
down
from
the
summit
of
the
range
to
the
edge
of
the
mono
desert
making
a
descent
of
about
four
thousand
feet
in
a
distance
of
about
four
miles
it
was
known
and
traveled
as
a
pass
by
wild
animals
and
the
indians
long
before
its
discovery
by
white
men
in
the
gold
year
of
as
is
shown
by
old
trails
which
come
together
at
the
head
of
it
the
name
may
have
been
suggested
by
the
red
color
of
the
metamorphic
slates
in
which
the
ca単on
abounds
or
by
the
blood
stains
on
the
rocks
from
the
unfortunate
animals
that
were
compelled
to
slide
and
shuffle
over
the
boulders
early
in
the
morning
i
tied
my
notebook
and
some
bread
to
my
belt
and
strode
away
full
of
eager
hope
feeling
that
i
was
going
to
have
a
glorious
revel
the
glacier
meadows
that
lay
along
my
way
served
to
soothe
my
morning
speed
for
the
sod
was
full
of
blue
gentians
and
daisies
kalmia
and
dwarf
vaccinium
calling
for
recognition
as
old
friends
and
i
had
to
stop
many
times
to
examine
the
shining
rocks
over
which
the
ancient
glacier
had
passed
with
tremendous
pressure
polishing
them
so
well
that
they
reflected
the
sunlight
like
glass
in
some
places
while
fine
stri脱
seen
clearly
through
a
lens
indicated
the
direction
in
which
the
ice
had
flowed
on
some
of
the
sloping
polished
pavements
abrupt
steps
occur
showing
that
occasionally
large
masses
of
the
rock
had
given
way
before
the
glacial
pressure
as
well
as
small
particles
moraines
too
some
scattered
others
regular
like
long
curving
embankments
and
dams
occur
here
and
there
giving
the
general
surface
of
the
region
a
young
appearance
i
watched
the
gradual
dwarfing
of
the
pines
as
i
ascended
and
the
corresponding
dwarfing
of
nearly
all
the
rest
of
the
vegetation
on
the
slopes
of
mammoth
mountain
to
the
south
of
the
pass
i
saw
many
gaps
in
the
woods
reaching
from
the
upper
edge
of
the
down
to
the
level
meadows
where
avalanches
of
snow
had
descended
sweeping
away
every
tree
in
their
paths
as
well
as
the
soil
they
were
growing
in
leaving
the
bedrock
bare
the
trees
are
nearly
all
uprooted
but
a
few
that
had
been
extremely
well
anchored
in
clefts
of
the
rock
were
broken
off
near
the
ground
it
seems
strange
at
first
sight
that
trees
that
had
been
allowed
to
grow
for
a
century
or
more
undisturbed
should
in
their
old
age
be
thus
swished
away
at
a
stroke
such
avalanches
can
only
occur
under
rare
conditions
of
weather
and
snowfall
no
doubt
on
some
positions
of
the
mountain
slopes
the
inclination
and
smoothness
of
the
surface
is
such
that
avalanches
must
occur
every
winter
or
even
after
every
heavy
snowstorm
and
of
course
no
trees
or
even
bushes
can
grow
in
their
channels
i
noticed
a
few
slopes
of
this
kind
the
uprooted
trees
that
had
grown
in
the
pathway
of
what
might
be
called
century
avalanches
were
piled
in
windrows
and
tucked
snugly
against
the
of
the
gaps
heads
downward
excepting
a
few
that
were
carried
out
into
the
open
ground
of
the
meadows
where
the
heads
of
the
avalanches
had
stopped
young
pines
mostly
the
and
the
are
already
springing
up
in
these
cleared
gaps
it
would
be
interesting
to
ascertain
the
age
of
these
saplings
for
thus
we
should
gain
a
fair
approximation
to
the
year
that
the
great
avalanches
occurred
perhaps
most
or
all
of
them
occurred
the
same
winter
how
glad
i
should
be
if
free
to
pursue
such
studies
near
the
summit
at
the
head
of
the
pass
i
found
a
species
of
dwarf
willow
lying
perfectly
flat
on
the
ground
making
a
nice
soft
silky
gray
carpet
not
a
single
stem
or
branch
more
than
three
inches
high
but
the
catkins
which
are
now
nearly
ripe
stand
erect
and
make
a
close
nearly
regular
gray
growth
being
larger
than
all
the
rest
of
the
plants
some
of
these
interesting
dwarfs
have
only
one
catkin
willow
bushes
reduced
to
their
lowest
terms
i
found
patches
of
dwarf
vaccinium
also
forming
smooth
carpets
closely
pressed
to
the
ground
or
against
the
sides
of
stones
and
covered
with
round
pink
flowers
in
lavish
abundance
as
if
they
had
fallen
from
the
sky
like
hail
a
little
higher
almost
at
the
very
head
of
the
pass
i
found
the
blue
arctic
daisy
and
bryanthus
the
mountain
own
darlings
gentle
mountaineers
face
to
face
with
the
sky
kept
safe
and
warm
by
a
thousand
miracles
seeming
always
the
finer
and
purer
the
wilder
and
stormier
their
homes
the
trees
tough
and
resiny
seem
unable
to
go
a
step
farther
but
up
and
up
far
above
the
these
tender
plants
climb
cheerily
spreading
their
gray
and
pink
carpets
right
up
to
the
very
edges
of
the
in
deep
hollows
and
shadows
here
too
is
the
familiar
robin
tripping
on
the
flowery
lawns
bravely
singing
the
same
cheery
song
i
first
heard
when
a
boy
in
wisconsin
newly
arrived
from
old
scotland
in
this
fine
company
sauntering
enchanted
taking
no
heed
of
time
i
at
length
entered
the
gate
of
the
pass
and
the
huge
rocks
began
to
close
around
me
in
all
their
mysterious
impressiveness
just
then
i
was
startled
by
a
lot
of
queer
hairy
muffled
creatures
coming
shuffling
shambling
wallowing
toward
me
as
if
they
had
no
bones
in
their
bodies
had
i
discovered
them
while
they
were
yet
a
good
way
off
i
should
have
tried
to
avoid
them
what
a
picture
they
made
contrasted
with
the
others
i
had
just
been
admiring
when
i
came
up
to
them
i
found
that
they
were
only
a
band
of
indians
from
mono
on
their
way
to
yosemite
for
a
load
of
acorns
they
were
wrapped
in
blankets
made
of
the
skins
of
the
dirt
on
some
of
the
faces
seemed
almost
old
enough
and
thick
enough
to
have
a
geological
significance
some
were
strangely
blurred
and
divided
into
sections
by
seams
and
wrinkles
that
looked
like
cleavage
joints
and
had
a
worn
abraded
look
as
if
they
had
lain
exposed
to
the
weather
for
ages
i
tried
to
pass
them
without
stopping
but
they
would
let
me
forming
a
dismal
circle
about
me
i
was
closely
besieged
while
they
begged
whiskey
or
tobacco
and
it
was
hard
to
convince
them
that
i
had
any
how
glad
i
was
to
get
away
from
the
gray
grim
crowd
and
see
them
vanish
down
the
trail
yet
it
seems
sad
to
feel
such
desperate
repulsion
from
one
fellow
beings
however
degraded
to
prefer
the
society
of
squirrels
and
woodchucks
to
that
of
our
own
species
must
surely
be
unnatural
so
with
a
fresh
breeze
and
a
hill
or
mountain
between
us
i
must
wish
them
godspeed
and
try
to
pray
and
sing
with
burns
it
coming
yet
for
that
that
man
to
man
the
warld
shall
brothers
be
for
a
that
how
the
day
passed
i
hardly
know
by
the
map
i
have
come
only
about
ten
or
twelve
miles
though
the
sun
is
already
low
in
the
west
showing
how
long
i
must
have
lingered
observing
sketching
taking
notes
among
the
glaciated
rocks
and
moraines
and
alpine
at
sundown
the
somber
crags
and
peaks
were
inspired
with
the
ineffable
beauty
of
the
alpenglow
and
a
solemn
awful
stillness
hushed
everything
in
the
landscape
then
i
crept
into
a
hollow
by
the
side
of
a
small
lake
near
the
head
of
the
ca単on
smoothed
a
sheltered
spot
and
gathered
a
few
pine
tassels
for
a
bed
after
the
short
twilight
began
to
fade
i
kindled
a
sunny
fire
made
a
tin
cupful
of
tea
and
lay
down
to
watch
the
stars
soon
the
began
to
flow
from
the
snowy
peaks
overhead
at
first
only
a
gentle
breathing
then
gaining
strength
in
less
than
an
hour
rumbled
in
massive
volume
something
like
a
boisterous
stream
in
a
channel
roaring
and
moaning
down
the
ca単on
as
if
the
work
it
had
to
do
was
tremendously
important
and
fateful
and
mingled
with
these
storm
tones
were
those
of
the
waterfalls
on
the
north
side
of
the
ca単on
now
sounding
distinctly
now
smothered
by
the
heavier
cataracts
of
air
making
a
glorious
psalm
of
savage
wildness
my
fire
squirmed
and
struggled
as
if
ill
at
ease
for
though
in
a
sheltered
nook
detached
masses
of
icy
wind
often
fell
like
icebergs
on
top
of
it
scattering
sparks
and
coals
so
that
i
had
to
keep
well
back
to
avoid
being
burned
but
the
big
resiny
roots
and
knots
of
the
dwarf
pine
could
neither
be
beaten
out
nor
blown
away
and
the
flames
now
rushing
up
in
long
lances
now
flattened
and
twisted
on
the
rocky
ground
roared
as
if
trying
to
tell
the
storm
stories
of
the
trees
they
belonged
to
as
the
light
given
out
was
telling
the
story
of
the
sunshine
they
had
gathered
in
centuries
of
summers
the
stars
shone
clear
in
the
strip
of
sky
between
the
huge
dark
cliffs
and
as
i
lay
recalling
the
lessons
of
the
day
suddenly
the
full
moon
looked
down
over
the
ca単on
wall
her
face
apparently
filled
with
eager
concern
which
had
a
startling
effect
as
if
she
had
left
her
place
in
the
sky
and
had
come
down
to
gaze
on
me
alone
like
a
person
entering
one
bedroom
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
she
was
in
her
place
in
the
sky
and
was
looking
abroad
on
half
the
globe
land
and
sea
mountains
plains
lakes
rivers
oceans
ships
cities
with
their
myriads
of
inhabitants
sleeping
and
waking
sick
and
well
no
she
seemed
to
be
just
on
the
rim
of
bloody
ca単on
and
looking
only
at
me
this
was
indeed
getting
near
to
nature
i
remember
watching
the
harvest
moon
rising
above
the
oak
trees
in
wisconsin
apparently
as
big
as
a
and
not
farther
than
half
a
mile
distant
with
these
exceptions
i
might
say
i
never
before
had
seen
the
moon
and
this
night
she
seemed
so
full
of
life
and
so
near
the
effect
was
marvelously
impressive
and
made
me
forget
the
indians
the
great
black
rocks
above
me
and
the
wild
uproar
of
the
winds
and
waters
making
their
way
down
the
huge
jagged
gorge
of
course
i
slept
but
little
and
gladly
welcomed
the
dawn
over
the
mono
desert
by
the
time
i
had
made
a
cupful
of
tea
the
sunbeams
were
pouring
through
the
ca単on
and
i
set
forth
gazing
eagerly
at
the
tremendous
walls
of
red
slates
savagely
hacked
and
scarred
and
apparently
ready
to
fall
in
avalanches
great
enough
to
choke
the
pass
and
fill
up
the
chain
of
lakelets
but
soon
its
beauties
came
to
view
and
i
bounded
lightly
from
rock
to
rock
admiring
the
polished
bosses
shining
in
the
slant
sunshine
with
glorious
effect
in
the
general
roughness
of
moraines
and
avalanche
taluses
even
toward
the
head
of
the
ca単on
near
the
highest
fountains
of
the
ice
here
too
are
most
of
the
lowly
plant
people
seen
yesterday
on
the
other
side
of
the
divide
now
opening
their
beautiful
eyes
none
could
fail
to
glory
in
nature
tender
care
for
them
in
so
wild
a
place
the
little
ouzel
is
flitting
from
rock
to
rock
along
the
rapid
swirling
ca単on
creek
diving
for
breakfast
in
icy
pools
and
merrily
singing
as
if
the
huge
rugged
gorge
was
the
most
delightful
of
all
its
mountain
homes
besides
a
high
fall
on
the
north
wall
of
the
ca単on
apparently
coming
direct
from
the
sky
there
are
many
narrow
cascades
bright
silvery
ribbons
zigzagging
down
the
red
cliffs
tracing
the
diagonal
cleavage
joints
of
the
metamorphic
slates
now
contracted
and
out
of
sight
now
leaping
from
ledge
to
ledge
in
filmy
sheets
through
which
the
sunbeams
sift
and
on
the
main
ca単on
creek
to
which
all
these
are
tributary
is
a
series
of
small
falls
cascades
and
rapids
extending
all
the
way
down
to
the
foot
of
the
ca単on
interrupted
only
by
the
lakes
in
which
the
tossed
and
beaten
waters
rest
one
of
the
finest
of
the
cascades
is
outspread
on
the
face
of
a
precipice
its
waters
separated
into
strips
and
woven
into
a
pattern
by
tracing
the
cleavage
joints
of
the
rock
while
tufts
of
bryanthus
grass
sedge
saxifrage
form
beautiful
fringes
who
could
imagine
beauty
so
fine
in
so
savage

place

one

cascade
is
in
the
lower
region
of
the
pass
where
the
vegetation
is
snowy
and
luxuriant
wild
rose
and
dogwood
form
dense
masses
overarching
the
stream
and
out
of
this
bower
the
creek
grown
strong
with
many
indashing
tributaries
leaps
forth
into
the
light
and
descends
in
a
fluted
curve
with
crisp
flashing
spray
at
the
foot
of
the
ca単on
there
is
a
lake
formed
in
part
at
least
by
the
damming
of
the
stream
by
a
terminal
moraine
the
three
other
lakes
in
the
ca単on
are
in
basins
eroded
from
the
solid
rock
where
the
pressure
of
the
glacier
was
greatest
and
the
most
resisting
portions
of
the
basin
rims
are
beautifully
tellingly
polished
below
moraine
lake
at
the
foot
of
the
ca単on
there
are
several
old
lying
between
the
large
lateral
moraines
which
extend
out
into
the
desert
these
basins
are
now
completely
filled
up
by
the
material
carried
in
by
the
streams
and
changed
to
dry
sandy
flats
covered
mostly
by
grass
and
artemisia
and
flowers
all
these
lower
were
evidently
formed
by
terminal
moraine
dams
deposited
where
the
receding
glacier
had
lingered
during
short
periods
of
less
waste
or
greater
snowfall
or
both
looking
up
the
ca単on
from
the
warm
sunny
edge
of
the
mono
plain
my
morning
ramble
seems
a
dream
so
great
is
the
change
in
the
vegetation
and
climate
the
lilies
on
the
bank
of
moraine
lake
are
higher
than
my
head
and
the
sunshine
is
hot
enough
for
palms
yet
the
snow
round
the
arctic
gardens
at
the
summit
of
the
pass
is
plainly
visible
only
about
four
miles
away
and
between
lie
specimen
zones
of
all
the
principal
climates
of
the
globe
in
little
more
than
an
hour
one
may
swoop
down
from
winter
to
summer
from
an
arctic
to
a
torrid
region
through
as
great
changes
of
climate
as
one
would
encounter
in
traveling
from
labrador
to
florida
the
indians
i
had
met
near
the
head
of
the
ca単on
had
camped
at
the
foot
of
it
the
night
before
they
made
the
ascent
and
i
found
their
fire
still
smoking
on
the
side
of
a
small
tributary
stream
near
moraine
lake
and
on
the
edge
of
what
is
called
the
mono
desert
four
or
five
miles
from
the
lake
i
came
to
a
patch
of
elymus
or
wild
rye
growing
in
magnificent
waving
clumps
six
or
eight
feet
high
bearing
heads
six
to
eight
inches
long
the
crop
was
ripe
and
indian
women
were
gathering
the
grain
in
baskets
by
bending
down
large
handfuls
beating
out
the
seed
and
fanning
it
in
the
wind
the
grains
are
about
five
eighths
of
an
inch
long
and
sweet
i
fancy
the
bread
made
from
it
must
be
as
good
as
wheat
bread
a
fine
squirrelish
employment
this
wild
grain
gathering
seems
and
the
women
were
evidently
enjoying
it
laughing
and
chattering
and
looking
almost
natural
though
most
indians
i
have
seen
are
not
a
whit
more
natural
in
their
lives
than
we
civilized
whites
perhaps
if
i
knew
them
better
i
should
like
them
better
the
worst
thing
about
them
is
their
uncleanliness
nothing
truly
wild
is
unclean
down
on
the
shore
of
mono
lake
i
saw
a
number
of
their
flimsy
huts
on
the
banks
of
streams
that
dash
swiftly
into
that
dead
sea
mere
brush
tents
where
they
lie
and
eat
at
their
ease
some
of
the
men
were
feasting
on
buffalo
berries
lying
beneath
the
tall
bushes
now
red
with
fruit
the
berries
are
rather
insipid
but
they
must
needs
be
wholesome
since
for
days
and
weeks
the
indians
it
is
said
eat
nothing
else
in
the
season
they
in
like
manner
depend
chiefly
on
the
fat
larv脱
of
a
fly
that
breeds
in
the
salt
water
of
the
lake
or
on
the
big
fat
corrugated
caterpillars
of
a
species
of
silkworm
that
feeds
on
the
leaves
of
the
yellow
pine
occasionally
a
grand
is
organized
and
hundreds
are
slain
with
clubs
on
the
lake
shore
chased
and
frightened
into
a
dense
crowd
by
dogs
boys
girls
men
and
women
and
rings
of
sage
brush
fire
when
of
course
they
are
quickly
killed
the
skins
are
made
into
blankets
in
the
autumn
the
more
enterprising
of
the
hunters
bring
in
a
good
many
deer
and
rarely
a
wild
sheep
from
the
high
peaks
antelopes
used
to
be
abundant
on
the
desert
at
the
base
of
the
interior

grouse
and
squirrels

to
vary
their
wild

worms

also
from
the
small
interesting

good

are
made

it
is
said
that
wars
on
account
of
encroachments
on
each
other
are
of
common
occurrence
among
the
various
tribes
and
families
each
claims
a
certain
marked
portion
of
the

the
pine
nuts
are
delicious
large
quantities
are
gathered
every
autumn
the
tribes
of
the
west
flank
of
the

acorns
for
worms
and
pine
nuts
the
squaws
carry
immense

on
their

all

in

among

i
discovered
a

fawn
at
first
it
seemed
inclined
to
come
to
me
but
when
i
tried
to
catch
it
and
got
within
a
rod
or
two
it
turned
and
walked
softly
away
choosing
its
steps
like
a
cautious
stealthy
hunting
cat
then
as
if
suddenly
called
or
alarmed
it
began
to
buck
and
run
like
a

jumping
high
above

and
was
soon
out

possibly
its

may
have
called
it

i
did
not

ever
leave

there

not

i
still

him
he
never
left
me
before
panthers
are
very
rare
here
and
i
do
think
any
of
these

would
dare
touch
him
he
knows

winter
or
all
my
life
or
even
all
eternity
frost
this
morning
all
the
meadow
grass
and
some
of
the
pine
needles
sparkling
with
irised
crystals
flowers
of
light
large
picturesque
clouds
craggy
like
rocks
are
piled
on
mount
dana
reddish
in
color
like
the
mountain
itself
the
sky
for
a
few
degrees
around
the
horizon
is
pale
purple
into
which
the
pines
dip
their
spires
with
fine
effect
spent
the
day
as
usual
looking
about
me
watching
the
changing
lights
the
ripening
autumn
colors
of
the
grass
seeds
gentians
asters
goldenrods
parting
the
meadow
grass
here
and
there
and
looking
down
into
the
underworld
of
mosses
and
liverworts
watching
the
busy
ants
and
beetles
and
other
small
people
at
work
and
play
like
squirrels
and
bears
in
a
forest
studying
the
formation
of
lakes
and
meadows
moraines
mountain
sculpture
making
small
beginnings
in
these
directions
charmed
by
the
serene
beauty
of
everything
the
day
has
been
extra
cloudy
though
bright
on
the
whole
for
the
clouds
were
brighter
than
common
clouds
about
which
in
switzerland
would
be
considered
extra
clear
probably
more
free
sunshine
falls
on
this
majestic
range
than
on
any
other
in
the
world
i
ever
seen
or
heard
of
it
has
the
brightest
weather
brightest
rocks
the
greatest
abundance
of
irised
spray
from
its
glorious
waterfalls
the
brightest
forests
of
silver
firs
and
silver
pines
more
moonshine
and
perhaps
more
than
any
other
mountain
chain
and
its
countless
mirror
lakes
having
more
light
poured
into
them
glow
and
spangle
most
and
how
glorious
the
shining
after
the
short
summer
showers
and
after
frosty
nights
when
the
morning
sunbeams
are
pouring
through
the
crystals
on
the
grass
and
pine
needles
and
how
ineffably
spiritually
fine
is
the
on
the
and
the
alpenglow
of
evening
well
may
the
sierra
be
named
not
the
snowy
range
but
the
range
of
light
clouds
only
mostly
white
and
pink
cumuli
over
the
hoffman
spur
towards
evening
frosty
morning
crystals
grow
in
marvelous
beauty
and
perfection
of
form
these
still
nights
every
one
built
as
carefully
as
the
grandest
holiest
temple
as
if
planned
to
endure
forever
contemplating
the
fabric
of
streams
outspread
over
the
mountains
we
are
reminded
that
everything
is
flowing
going
somewhere
animals
and
lifeless
rocks
as
well
as
water
thus
the
snow
flows
fast
or
slow
in
grand
glaciers
and
avalanches
the
air
in
majestic
floods
carrying
minerals
plant
leaves
seeds
spores
with
streams
of
music
and
fragrance
water
streams
carrying
rocks
both
in
solution
and
in
the
form
of
mud
particles
sand
pebbles
and
boulders
rocks
flow
from
volcanoes
like
water
from
springs
and
animals
flock
together
and
flow
in
currents
modified
by
stepping
leaping
gliding
flying
swimming
etc
while
the
stars
go
streaming
through
space
pulsed
on
and
on
forever
like
blood
globules
in
nature
warm
heart
the
dawn
a
glorious
song
of
color
sky
absolutely
cloudless
a
fine
crop
hoarfrost
warm
after
ten
the
gentians
do
mind
the
first
frost
though
their
petals
seem
so
delicate
they
close
every
night
as
if
going
to
sleep
and
awake
fresh
as
ever
in
the
morning
the
grass
is
a
shade
browner
since
last
week
but
there
are
no
nipped
wilted
plants
of
any
sort
as
far
as
i
have
seen
butterflies
and
the
grand
host
of
smaller
flies
are
benumbed
every
night
but
they
hover
and
dance
in
the
sunbeams
over
the
meadows
before
noon
with
no
apparent
lack
of
playful
joyful
life
soon
they
must
all
fall
like
petals
in
an
orchard
dry
and
wrinkled
not
a
wing
of
all
the
mighty
host
left
to
tingle
the
air
nevertheless
new
myriads
will
arise
in
the
spring
rejoicing
exulting
as
if
laughing
cold
death
to
scorn
clouds
about
slight
frost
bland
serene
indian
summer
weather
have
been
gazing
all
day
at
the
mountains
watching
the
changing
lights
more
and
more
plainly
are
they
clothed
with
light
as
a
garment
white
tinged
with
pale
purple
palest
during
the
midday
hours
richest
in
the
morning
and
evening
everything
seems
consciously
peaceful
thoughtful
faithfully
waiting
god
will
this
day
just
like
yesterday
a
few
clouds
motionless
and
apparently
with
no
work
to
do
beyond
looking
beautiful
frost
enough
for
crystal
building
glorious
fields
of
destined
to
last
but
a
night
how
lavish
is
nature
building
pulling
down
creating
destroying
chasing
every
material
particle
from
form
to
form
ever
changing
ever
beautiful
delaney
arrived
this
morning
felt
not
a
trace
of
loneliness
while
he
was
gone
on
the
contrary
i
never
enjoyed
grander
company
the
whole
wilderness
seems
to
be
alive
and
familiar
full
of
humanity
the
very
stones
seem
talkative
sympathetic
brotherly
no
wonder
when
we
consider
that
we
all
have
the
same
father
and
mother
clouds
silky
cirrus
wisps
and
fringes
so
fine
they
almost
escape
notice
frost
enough
for
another
crop
of
crystals
on
the
meadows
but
none
on
the
forests
the
gentians
goldenrods
asters
do
seem
to
feel
it
neither
petals
nor
leaves
are
touched
though
they
seem
so
tender
every
day
opens
and
closes
like
a
flower
noiseless
effortless
divine
peace
glows
on
all
the
majestic
landscape
like
the
silent
enthusiastic
joy
that
sometimes
transfigures
a
noble
human
face
clouds
motionless
of
no
particular
color
ornaments
with
no
hint
of
rain
or
snow
in
them
day
all
calm
another
grand
throb
of
nature
heart
ripening
late
flowers
and
seeds
for
next
summer
full
of
life
and
the
thoughts
and
plans
of
life
to
come
and
full
of
ripe
and
ready
death
beautiful
as
life
telling
divine
wisdom
and
goodness
and
immortality
have
been
up
mount
dana
making
haste
to
see
as
much
as
i
can
now
that
the
time
of
departure
is
drawing
nigh
the
views
from
the
summit
reach
far
and
wide
eastward
over
the
mono
lake
and
desert
mountains
beyond
mountains
looking
strangely
barren
and
gray
and
bare
like
heaps
of
ashes
dumped
from
the
sky
the
lake
eight
or
ten
miles
in
diameter
shines
like
a
burnished
disk
of
silver
no
trees
about
its
gray
ashy
cindery
shores
looking
westward
the
glorious
forests
are
seen
sweeping
over
countless
ridges
and
hills
girdling
domes
and
subordinate
mountains
fringing
in
long
curving
lines
the
dividing
ridges
and
filling
every
hollow
where
the
glaciers
have
spread
however
rocky
or
smooth
looking
northward
and
southward
along
the
axis
of
the
range
you
see
the
glorious
array
of
high
mountains
crags
and
peaks
and
snow
the
of
rivers
that
are
flowing
west
to
the
sea
through
the
famous
golden
gate
and
east
to
hot
salt
lakes
and
deserts
to
evaporate
and
hurry
back
into
the
sky
innumerable
lakes
are
shining
like
eyes
beneath
heavy
rock
brows
bare
or
tree
fringed
or
imbedded
in
black
forests
meadow
openings
in
the
woods
seem
as
numerous
as
the
lakes
or
perhaps
more
so
far
up
the
slopes
and
among
crumbling
rocks
i
found
many
delicate
hardy
plants
some
of
them
still
in
flower
the
best
gains
of
this
trip
were
the
lessons
of
unity
and
interrelation
of
all
the
features
of
the
landscape
revealed
in
general
views
the
lakes
and
meadows
are
located
just
where
the
ancient
glaciers
bore
heaviest
at
the
foot
of
the
steepest
parts
of
their
channels
and
of
course
their
longest
diameters
are
approximately
parallel
with
each
other
and
with
the
belts
of
forests
growing
in
long
curving
lines
on
the
lateral
and
medial
moraines
and
in
broad
outspreading
fields
on
the
terminal
beds
deposited
toward
the
end
of
the
ice
period
when
the
glaciers
were
receding
the
domes
ridges
and
spurs
also
show
the
influence
of
glacial
action
in
their
forms
which
approximately
seem
to
be
the
forms
of
greatest
strength
with
reference
to
the
stress
of
oversweeping
survivals
of
the
most
resisting
masses
or
those
most
favorably
situated
how
interesting
everything
is
every
rock
mountain
stream
plant
lake
lawn
forest
garden
bird
beast
insect
seems
to
call
and
invite
us
to
come
and
learn
something
of
its
history
and
relationship
but
shall
the
poor
ignorant
scholar
be
allowed
to
try
the
lessons
they
offer
it
seems
too
great
and
good
to
be
true
soon
i
be
going
to
the
lowlands
the
bread
camp
must
soon
be
removed
if
i
had
a
few
sacks
of
flour
an
axe
and
some
matches
i
would
build
a
cabin
of
pine
logs
pile
up
plenty
of
firewood
about
it
and
stay
all
winter
to
see
the
grand
fertile
watch
the
birds
and
animals
that
winter
thus
high
how
they
live
how
the
forests
look
or
buried
and
how
the
avalanches
look
and
sound
on
their
way
down
the
mountains
but
now
i
have
to
go
for
there
is
nothing
to
spare
in
the
way
of
provisions
i
surely
be
back
however
surely
i
be
back
no
other
place
has
ever
so
overwhelmingly
attracted
me
as
this
hospitable
godful
wilderness
illustration
one
of
the
highest
mount
ritter
fountains
a
grand
red
rosy
crimson
day
a
perfect
glory
of
a
day
what
it
means
i
do
know
it
is
the
first
marked
change
from
tranquil
sunshine
with
purple
mornings
and
evenings
and
still
white
noons
there
is
nothing
like
a
storm
however
the
average
cloudiness
only
about
and
there
is
no
sighing
in
the
woods
to
betoken
a
big
weather
change
the
sky
was
red
in
the
morning
and
evening
the
color
not
diffused
like
the
ordinary
purple
glow
but
loaded
upon
separate
clouds
that
remained
motionless
as
if
anchored
around
the
jagged
horizon
a
cap
bluffy
around
its
sides
lingered
a
long
time
on
mount
dana
and
mount
gibbs
drooping
so
low
as
to
hide
most
of
their
bases
but
leaving
dana
round
summit
free
which
seemed
to
float
separate
and
alone
over
the
big
crimson
cloud
mammoth
mountain
to
the
south
of
gibbs
and
bloody
ca単on
striped
and
spotted
with
and
clumps
of
dwarf
pine
was
also
favored
with
a
glorious
crimson
cap
in
the
making
of
which
there
was
no
trace
of
economy
a
huge
bossy
pile
colored
with
a
perfect
passion
of
crimson
that
seemed
important
enough
to
be
sent
off
to
burn
among
the
stars
in
majestic
independence
one
is
constantly
reminded
of
the
infinite
lavishness
and
fertility
of
nature
inexhaustible
abundance
amid
what
seems
enormous
waste
and
yet
when
we
look
into
any
of
her
operations
that
lie
within
reach
of
our
minds
we
learn
that
no
particle
of
her
material
is
wasted
or
worn
out
it
is
eternally
flowing
from
use
to
use
beauty
to
yet
higher
beauty
and
we
soon
cease
to
lament
waste
and
death
and
rather
rejoice
and
exult
in
the
imperishable
unspendable
wealth
of
the
universe
and
faithfully
watch
and
wait
the
reappearance
of
everything
that
melts
and
fades
and
dies
about
us
feeling
sure
that
its
next
appearance
will
be
better
and
more
beautiful
than
the
last
i
watched
the
growth
of
these
of
the
sky
as
eagerly
as
if
new
mountain
ranges
were
being
built
soon
the
group
of
snowy
peaks
in
whose
recesses
lie
the
highest
fountains
of
the
tuolumne
merced
and
north
fork
of
the
san
joaquin
were
decorated
with
majestic
colored
clouds
like
those
already
described
but
more
complicated
to
correspond
with
the
grand
of
the
rivers
they
overshadowed
the
sierra
cathedral
to
the
south
of
camp
was
overshadowed
like
sinai
never
before
noticed
so
fine
a
union
of
rock
and
cloud
in
form
and
color
and
substance
drawing
earth
and
sky
together
as
one
and
so
human
is
it
every
feature
and
tint
of
color
goes
to
one
heart
and
we
shout
exulting
in
wild
enthusiasm
as
if
all
the
divine
show
were
our
own
more
and
more
in
a
place
like
this
we
feel
ourselves
part
of
wild
nature
kin
to
everything
spent
most
of
the
day
high
up
on
the
north
rim
of
the
valley
commanding
views
of
the
clouds
in
all
their
red
glory
spreading
their
wonderful
light
over
all
the
basin
while
the
rocks
and
trees
and
small
alpine
plants
at
my
feet
seemed
hushed
and
thoughtful
as
if
they
also
were
conscious
spectators
of
the
glorious
new
here
and
there
as
i
plodded
farther
and
higher
i
came
to
small
and
ferneries
just
where
one
would
naturally
decide
that
no
could
possibly
live
but
as
in
the
region
about
the
head
of
mono
pass
and
the
top
of
dana
it
was
in
the
wildest
highest
places
that
the
most
beautiful
and
tender
and
enthusiastic
were
found
again
and
again
as
i
lingered
over
these
charming
plants
i
said
how
came
you
here
how
do
you
live
through
the
winter
our
roots
they
explained
reach
far
down
the
joints
of
the
rocks
and
beneath
our
fine
snow
mantle
killing
frosts
can
not
reach
us
while
we
sleep
away
the
dark
half
of
the
year
dreaming
of
spring
ever
since
i
was
allowed
entrance
into
these
mountains
i
have
been
looking
for
cassiope
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
and
best
loved
of
the
heathworts
but
strange
to
say
i
have
not
yet
found
it
on
my
high
mountain
walks
i
keep
muttering
cassiope
cassiope
this
name
as
calvinists
say
is
driven
in
upon
me
notwithstanding
the
glorious
host
of
plants
that
come
about
me
uncalled
as
soon
as
i
show
myself
cassiope
seems
the
highest
name
of
all
the
small
people
and
as
if
conscious
of
her
worth
keeps
out
of
my
way
i
must
find
her
soon
if
at
all
this
year
all
the
vast
sky
dome
is
clear
filled
only
with
mellow
indian
summer
light
the
pine
and
hemlock
and
fir
cones
are
nearly
ripe
and
are
falling
fast
from
morning
to
night
cut
off
and
gathered
by
the
busy
squirrels
almost
all
the
plants
have
matured
their
seeds
their
summer
work
done
and
the
summer
crop
of
birds
and
deer
will
soon
be
able
to
follow
their
parents
to
the
foothills
and
plains
at
the
approach
of
winter
when
the
snow
begins
to
fly
no
clouds
weather
cool
calm
bright
as
if
no
great
thing
was
yet
ready
to
be
done
have
been
sketching
the
north
tuolumne
church
the
sunset
gloriously
colored
still
another
perfectly
cloudless
day
purple
evening
and
morning
all
the
middle
hours
one
mass
of
pure
serene
sunshine
soon
after
sunrise
the
air
grew
warm
and
there
was
no
wind
one
naturally
halted
to
see
what
nature
intended
to
do
there
is
a
suggestion
of
real
indian
summer
in
the
hushed
brooding
faintly
hazy
weather
the
yellow
atmosphere
though
thin
is
still
plainly
of
the
same
general
character
as
that
of
eastern
indian
summer
the
peculiar
mellowness
is
perhaps
in
part
caused
by
myriads
of
ripe
spores
adrift
in
the
sky
delaney
now
keeps
up
a
solemn
talk
about
the
need
of
getting
away
from
these
high
mountains
telling
sad
stories
of
flocks
that
perished
in
storms
that
broke
suddenly
into
the
midst
of
fine
innocent
weather
like
this
we
are
now
enjoying
in
no
case
said
he
will
i
venture
to
stay
so
high
and
far
back
in
the
mountains
as
we
now
are
later
than
the
middle
of
this
month
no
matter
how
warm
and
sunny
it
may
be
he
would
move
the
flock
slowly
at
first
a
few
miles
a
day
until
the
yosemite
creek
basin
was
reached
and
crossed
then
while
lingering
in
the
heavy
pine
woods
should
the
weather
threaten
he
could
hurry
down
to
the
foothills
where
the
snow
never
falls
deep
enough
to
smother
a
sheep
of
course
i
am
anxious
to
see
as
much
of
the
wilderness
as
possible
in
the
few
days
left
me
and
i
say
again
may
the
good
time
come
when
i
can
stay
as
long
as
i
like
with
plenty
of
bread
far
and
free
from
trampling
flocks
though
i
may
well
be
thankful
for
this
generous
foodful
inspiring
summer
anyhow
we
never
know
where
we
must
go
nor
what
guides
we
are
to
get
men
storms
guardian
angels
or
sheep
perhaps
almost
everybody
in
the
least
natural
is
guarded
more
than
he
is
ever
aware
of
all
the
wilderness
seems
to
be
full
of
tricks
and
plans
to
drive
and
draw
us
up
into
god
light
have
been
busy
planning
and
baking
bread
for
at
least
one
more
good
wild
excursion
among
the
high
peaks
and
surely
none
however
hopefully
aiming
at
fortune
or
fame
ever
felt
so
gloriously
happily
excited
by
the
outlook
left
camp
at
daybreak
and
made
direct
for
cathedral
peak
intending
to
strike
eastward
and
southward
from
that
point
among
the
peaks
and
ridges
at
the
heads
of
the
tuolumne
merced
and
san
joaquin
rivers
down
through
the
pine
woods
i
made
my
way
across
the
tuolumne
river
and
meadows
and
up
the
heavily
timbered
slope
forming
the
south
boundary
of
the
upper
tuolumne
basin
along
the
east
side
of
cathedral
peak
and
up
to
its
topmost
spire
which
i
reached
at
noon
having
loitered
by
the
way
to
study
the
fine
trees
pine
mountain
pine
albicaulis
pine
silver
fir
and
the
most
charming
most
graceful
of
all
the
evergreens
the
mountain
hemlock
high
cool
meadows
also
detained
me
and
lakelets
and
avalanche
tracks
and
huge
quarries

front
of
cathedral
peak
all
the
way
up
from
the
big
meadows
to
the
base
of
the
cathedral
the
ground
is
covered
with
moraine
material
the
left
lateral
moraine
of
the
great
glacier
that
must
have
completely
filled
this
upper
tuolumne
basin
higher
there
are
several
small
terminal
moraines
of
residual
glaciers
shoved
forward
at
right
angles
against
the
grand
simple
lateral
of
the
main
tuolumne
glacier
a
fine
place
to
study
mountain
sculpture
and
soil
making
the
view
from
the
cathedral
spires
is
very
fine
and
telling
in
every
direction
innumerable
peaks
ridges
domes
meadows
lakes
and
woods
the
forests
extending
in
long
curving
lines
and
broad
fields
wherever
the
glaciers
have
left
soil
for
them
to
grow
on
while
the
sides
of
the
highest
mountains
show
a
straggling
dwarf
growth
clinging
to
rifts
in
the
rocks
apparently
independent
of
soil
the
dark
growth
on
the
cathedral
roof
i
found
to
be
dwarf
albicaulis
pine
about
three
or
four
feet
high
but
very
old
looking
many
of
them
are
bearing
cones
and
the
noisy
clarke
crow
is
eating
the
seeds
using
his
long
bill
like
a
woodpecker
in
digging
them
out
of
the
cones
a
good
many
flowers
are
still
in
bloom
about
the
base
of
the
peak
and
even
on
the
roof
among
the
little
pines
especially
a
woody
eriogonum
and
a
handsome
aster
the
body
of
the
cathedral
is
nearly
square
and
the
roof
slopes
are
wonderfully
regular
and
symmetrical
the
ridge
trending
northeast
and
southwest
this
direction
has
apparently
been
determined
by
structure
joints
in
the
granite
the
gable
on
the
northeast
end
is
magnificent
in
size
and
simplicity
and
at
its
base
there
is
a
big
protected
by
the
shadow
of
the
building
the
front
is
adorned
with
many
pinnacles
and
a
tall
spire
of
curious
workmanship
here
too
the
joints
in
the
rock
are
seen
to
have
played
an
important
part
in
determining
their
forms
and
size
and
general
arrangement
the
cathedral
is
said
to
be
about
eleven
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
but
the
height
of
the
building
itself
above
the
level
of
the
ridge
it
stands
on
is
about
fifteen
hundred
feet
a
mile
or
so
to
the
westward
there
is
a
handsome
lake
and
the
granite
about
it
is
shining
so
brightly
it
is
not
easy
in
some
places
to
trace
the
line
between
the
rock
and
water
both
shining
alike
of
this
lake
with
its
silvery
basin
and
bits
of
meadow
and
groves
i
have
a
fine
view
from
the
spires
also
of
lake
tenaya
cloud
rest
and
the
south
dome
of
yosemite
mount
starr
king
mount
hoffman
the
merced
peaks
and
the
vast
multitude
of
snowy
fountain
peaks
extending
far
north
and
south
along
the
axis
of
the
range
no
feature
however
of
all
the
noble
landscape
as
seen
from
here
seems
more
wonderful
than
the
cathedral
itself
a
temple
displaying
best
masonry
and
sermons
in
stones
how
often
i
have
gazed
at
it
from
the
tops
of
hills
and
ridges
and
through
openings
in
the
forests
on
my
many
short
excursions
devoutly
wondering
admiring
longing
this
i
may
say
is
the
first
time
i
have
been
at
church
in
california
led
here
at
last
every
door
graciously
opened
for
the
poor
lonely
worshiper
in
our
best
times
everything
turns
into
religion
all
the
world
seems
a
church
and
the
mountains
altars
and
lo
here
at
last
in
front
of
the
cathedral
is
blessed
cassiope
ringing
her
thousands
of
bells
the
sweetest
church
music
i
ever
enjoyed
listening
admiring
until
late
in
the
afternoon
i
compelled
myself
to
hasten
away
eastward
back
of
rough
sharp
spiry
splintery
peaks
all
of
them
granite
like
the
cathedral
sparkling
with
crystals
feldspar
quartz
hornblende
mica
tourmaline
had
a
rather
difficult
walk
and
creep
across
an
immense
snow
and
ice
cliff
which
gradually
increased
in
steepness
as
i
advanced
until
it
was
almost
impassable
slipped
on
a
dangerous
place
but
managed
to
stop
by
digging
my
heels
into
the
thawing
surface
just
on
the
brink
of
a
yawning
ice
gulf
camped
beside
a
little
pool
and
a
group
of
crinkled
dwarf
pines
and
as
i
sit
by
the
fire
trying
to
write
notes
the
shallow
pool
seems
fathomless
with
the
infinite
starry
heavens
in
it
while
the
onlooking
rocks
and
trees
tiny
shrubs
and
daisies
and
sedges
brought
forward
in
the
seem
full
of
thought
as
if
about
to
speak
aloud
and
tell
all
their
wild
stories
a
marvelously
impressive
meeting
in
which
every
one
has
something
worth
while
to
tell
and
beyond
the
out
in
the
solemn
darkness
how
impressive
is
the
music
of
a
choir
of
rills
singing
their
way
down
from
the
snow
to
the
river
and
when
we
call
to
mind
that
thousands
of
these
rejoicing
rills
are
assembled
in
each
one
of
the
main
streams
we
wonder
the
less
that
our
sierra
rivers
are
songful
all
the
way
to
the
sea
about
sundown
saw
a
flock
of
dun
grayish
sparrows
going
to
roost
in
crevices
of
a
crag
above
the
big
charming
little
mountaineers
found
a
species
of
sedge
in
flower
within
eight
or
ten
feet
of
a
judging
by
the
looks
of
the
ground
it
can
hardly
have
been
out
in
the
sunshine
much
longer
than
a
week
and
it
is
likely
to
be
buried
again
in
fresh
snow
in
a
month
or
so
thus
making
a
winter
about
ten
months
long
while
spring
summer
and
autumn
are
crowded
and
hurried
into
two
months
how
delightful
it
is
to
be
alone
here
how
wild
everything
is
wild
as
the
sky
and
as
pure
never
shall
i
forget
this
big
divine
day
the
cathedral
and
its
thousands
of
cassiope
bells
and
the
landscapes
around
them
and
this
camp
in
the
gray
crags
above
the
woods
with
its
stars
and

than
i
could

neither

keep

and
in
the
cirques
of
the

in

if
looking

all
the
immense

seems
raw
and
lifeless
as
a
quarry
yet
the
most
charming
flowers
were
found
rejoicing
in
countless
nooks
and

everywhere
i
must
have
done
three
or
four
days
climbing
work
in

perfectly

until
near

i
descended
into

there
is

and
when
all
the
excitement
of
seeing

was
wanting
i
was
tired
arrived
at
the
main
camp
at
nine
and
soon
was
sleeping
sound
as

chapter
xi
back
to
the
lowlands
weariness
rested
away
and
i
feel
eager
and
ready
for
another
excursion
a
month
or
two
long
in
the
same
wonderful
wilderness
now
however
i
must
turn
toward
the
lowlands
praying
and
hoping
heaven
will
shove
me
back
again
the
most
telling
thing
learned
in
these
mountain
excursions
is
the
influence
of
cleavage
joints
on
the
features
sculptured
from
the
general
mass
of
the
range
evidently
the
denudation
has
been
enormous
while
the
inevitable
outcome
is
subtle
balanced
beauty
comprehended
in
general
views
the
features
of
the
wildest
landscape
seem
to
be
as
harmoniously
related
as
the
features
of
a
human
face
indeed
they
look
human
and
radiate
spiritual
beauty
divine
thought
however
covered
and
concealed

delaney
has
hardly
had
time
to
ask
me
how
i
enjoyed
my
trip
though
he
has
facilitated
and
encouraged
my
plans
all
summer
and
declares
be
famous
some
day
a
kind
guess
that
seems
strange
and
incredible
to
a
wandering
with
never
a
thought
or
dream
of
fame
while
humbly
trying
to
trace
and
learn
and
enjoy
nature
lessons
the
camp
stuff
is
now
packed
on
the
horses
and
the
flock
is
headed
for
the
home
ranch
away
we
go
down
through
the
pines
leaving
the
lovely
lawn
where
we
have
camped
so
long
i
wonder
if
i
ever
see
it
again
the
sod
is
so
tough
and
close
it
is
scarcely
at
all
injured
by
the
sheep
fortunately
they
are
not
fond
of
silky
glacier
meadow
grass
the
day
is
perfectly
clear
not
a
cloud
or
the
faintest
hint
of
a
cloud
is
visible
and
there
is
no
wind
i
wonder
if
in
all
the
world
at
a
height
of
nine
thousand
feet
weather
so
steadily
faithfully
calm
and
bright
and
hospitable
may
anywhere
else
be
found
we
are
going
away
fearing
destructive
storms
though
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
weather
changes
so
great
though
the
water
is
now
low
in
the
river
the
usual
difficulty
occurred
in
getting
the
flock
across
it
every
sheep
seemed
to
be
invincibly
determined
to
die
any
sort
of
dry
death
rather
than
wet
its
feet
carlo
has
learned
the
sheep
business
as
perfectly
as
the
best
shepherd
and
it
is
interesting
to
watch
his
intelligent
efforts
to
push
or
frighten
the
silly
creatures
into
the
water
they
had
to
be
fairly
crowded
and
shoved
over
the
bank
and
when
at
last
one
crossed
because
it
could
not
push
its
way
back
the
whole
flock
suddenly
plunged
in
headlong
together
as
if
the
river
was
the
only
desirable
part
of
the
world
aside
from
mere
money
profit
one
would
rather
herd
wolves
than
sheep
as
soon
as
they
clambered
up
the
opposite
bank
they
began
baaing
and
feeding
as
if
nothing
unusual
had
happened
we
crossed
the
meadows
and
drove
slowly
up
the
south
rim
of
the
valley
through
the
same
woods
i
had
passed
on
my
way
to
cathedral
peak
and
camped
for
the
night
by
the
side
of
a
small
pond
on
top
of
the
big
lateral
moraine
in
the
morning
at
daybreak
not
one
of
the
two
thousand
sheep
was
in
sight
examining
the
tracks
we
discovered
that
they
had
been
scattered
perhaps
by
a
bear
in
a
few
hours
all
were
found
and
gathered
into
one
flock
again
had
fine
view
of
a
deer
how
graceful
and
perfect
in
every
way
it
seemed
as
compared
with
the
silly
dusty
tousled
sheep
from
the
high
ground
hereabouts
had
another
grand
view
to
the
northward
a
heaving
swelling
sea
of
domes
and
ridges
fringed
with
pines
and
bounded
by
innumerable
peaks

though
so
full
of
beautiful
life

the

is
already
brown
and
yellow
and
dry
the
creek
almost
dry
also
the
slender
form
of
the
pine
on
its

is
i
think
the
handsomest
i
have
anywhere
seen
it
might
easily
pass
at
first
sight
for
a
distinct
species
though
surely
only
a
variety
due
to
crowded
and
rapid
growth
on
good
soil
the
yellow
pine
is
as
variable
or
perhaps
more
so
the

here

higher

is
broad
branching
with
closely
furrowed

one
of
the
most
splendid
spectacles
these
glorious
sierra
forests
have
to
show
this
variety
of

regarded
as
a
distinct
species
by
some
botanists
the
basin
of
this
famous
yosemite
stream
is
extremely
rocky
seems
fairly
to
be
paved
with
domes
like
a
street
with
big
cobblestones
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
be
allowed
to
explore
it
it
draws
me
so
strongly
i
would
make
any
sacrifice
to
try
to
read
its
lessons
i
thank
god
for
this
glimpse
of
it
the
charms
of
these
mountains
are
beyond
all
common
reason
unexplainable
and
mysterious
as
life
itself
nearly
all

in

the

laden
with
superb

shining
with

them
off
at
a
great

bump
i
hear
them
falling

be
gathered

bread
those

drop
the
scales
and

when
fully
ripe

it
is
fine
to
see
the

flying
in
swirling
flocks
seeking
their

the
bole

dead
limbs
of
nearly
every

in

ornamented
by

the
night
the
forests
we
so
admired
in
summer
seem
still
more
beautiful
and
sublime
in
this
mellow
autumn
light
lovely
starry
night
the
tall
spiring
relieved
in
jet
black
against
the
sky
i
linger
by
the
fire
loath
to
go
to
bed
left
camp
early
ran
over
the
tuolumne
divide
and
down
a
few
miles
to
a
grove
of
sequoias
that
i
had
heard
of
directed
by
the
don
they
occupy
an
area
of
perhaps
less
than
a
hundred
acres
some
of
the
trees
are
noble
colossal
old
giants
surrounded
by
magnificent
sugar
pines
and
douglas
spruces
the
perfect
specimens
not
burned
or
broken
are
singularly
regular
and
symmetrical
though
not
at
all
conventional
showing
infinite
variety
in
general
unity
and
harmony
the
noble
shafts
with
rich
purplish
brown
fluted
bark
free
of
limbs
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
or
so
ornamented
here
and
there
with
leafy
rosettes
main
branches
of
the
oldest
trees
very
large
crooked
and
rugged
zigzagging
stiffly
outward
seemingly
lawless
yet
unexpectedly
stooping
just
at
the
right
distance
from
the
trunk
and
dissolving
in
dense
bossy
masses
of
branchlets
thus
making
a
regular
though
greatly
varied
outline
a
cylinder
of
leafy
outbulging
spray
masses
terminating
in
a
noble
dome
that
may
be
recognized
while
yet
far
off
upheaved
against
the
sky
above
the
dark
bed
of
pines
and
firs
and
spruces
the
king
of
all
conifers
not
only
in
size
but
in
sublime
majesty
of
behavior
and
port
i
found
a
black
charred
stump
about
thirty
feet
in
diameter
and
eighty
or
ninety
feet
high
a
venerable
impressive
old
monument
of
a
tree
that
in
its
prime
may
have
been
the
monarch
of
the
grove
seedlings
and
saplings
growing
up
here
and
there
thrifty
and
hopeful
giving
no
hint
of
the
dying
out
of
the
species
not
any
unfavorable
change
of
climate
but
only
fire
threatens
the
existence
of
these
noblest
of
god
trees
sorry
i
was
not
able
to
get
a
count
of
the
old
monument
annual
rings
camp
this
evening
at
hazel
green
on
the
broad
back
of
the
dividing
ridge
near
our
old
when
we
were
on
the
way
up
the
mountains
in
the
spring
this
ridge
has
the
finest
groves
and
finest
manzanita
and
ceanothus
thickets
i
have
yet
found
on
all
this
wonderful
summer
journey
made
a
long
descent
on
the
south
side
of
the
divide
to
brown
flat
the
grand
forests
now
left
above
us
though
the
sugar
pine
still
flourishes
fairly
well
and
with
the
yellow
pine
libocedrus
and
douglas
spruce
makes
forests
that
would
be
considered
most
wonderful
in
any
other
part
of
the
world
the
indians
here
with
great
concern
pointed
to
an
old
garden
patch
on
the
flat
and
told
us
to
keep
away
from
it
perhaps
some
of
their
tribe
are
buried
here
camped
this
evening
at
smith
mill
on
the
first
broad
mountain
bench
or
plateau
reached
in
ascending
the
range
where
pines
grow
large
enough
for
good
lumber
here
wheat
apples
peaches
and
grapes
grow
and
we
were
treated
to
wine
and
apples
the
wine
i
like
but
delaney
and
the
indian
driver
and
the
shepherd
seemed
to
think
the
stuff
divine
compared
to
sparkling
sierra
water
fresh
from
the
heavens
it
seemed
a
dull
muddy
stupid
drink
but
the
apples
best
of
fruits
how
delicious
they
were
fit
for
gods
or
men
on
the
way
down
from
brown
flat
we
stopped
at
bower
cave
and
i
spent
an
hour
in
it
one
of
the
most
novel
and
interesting
of
all
underground
mansions
plenty
of
sunlight
pours
into
it
through
the
leaves
of
the
four
maple
trees
growing
in
its
mouth
illuminating
its
clear
calm
pool
and
marble
chambers
a
charming
place
ravishingly
beautiful
but
the
accessible
parts
of
the
walls
sadly
disfigured
with
names
of
vandals
the
weather
still
golden
and
calm
but
hot
we
are
now
in
the
and
all
the
conifers
are
left
behind
except
the
gray
sabine
pine
camped
at
the
dutch
boy
ranch
where
there
are
extensive
barley
fields
now
showing
nothing
save
dusty
stubble
a
terribly
hot
dusty
sunburned
day
and
as
nothing
was
to
be
gained
by
loitering
where
the
flock
could
find
nothing
to
eat
save
thorny
twigs
and
chaparral
we
made
a
long
drive
and
before
sundown
reached
the
home
ranch
on
the
yellow
san
joaquin
plain
the
sheep
were
let
out
of
the
corral
one
by
one
this
morning
and
counted
and
strange
to
say
after
all
their
adventurous
wanderings
in
bewildering
rocks
and
brush
and
streams
scattered
by
bears
poisoned
by
azalea
kalmia
alkali
all
are
accounted
for
of
the
two
thousand
and
fifty
that
left
the
corral
in
the
spring
lean
and
weak
two
thousand
and
have
returned
fat
and
strong
the
losses
are
ten
killed
by
bears
one
by
a
rattlesnake
one
that
had
to
be
killed
after
it
had
broken
its
leg
on
a
boulder
slope
and
one
that
ran
away
in
blind
terror
on
being
accidentally
separated
from
the
flock
thirteen
all
told
of
the
other
twelve
doomed
never
to
return
three
were
sold
to
ranchmen
and
nine
were
made
camp
mutton
here
ends
my
forever
memorable
first
high
sierra
excursion
i
have
crossed
the
range
of
light
surely
the
brightest
and
best
of
all
the
lord
has
built
and
rejoicing
in
its
glory
i
gladly
gratefully
hopefully
pray
i
may
