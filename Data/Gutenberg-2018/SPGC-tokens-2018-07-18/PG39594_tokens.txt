chapter
i
the
hanging
of
the
mirror
it
was
a
june
morning
in
kentucky
the
doctor
nephew
coming
at
a
gallop
down
the
pike
into
lloydsboro
valley
reined
his
horse
to
a
walk
as
he
reached
the
railroad
crossing
and
leaning
forward
in
his
saddle
hesitated
a
moment
between
the
two
roads
the
one
along
the
railroad
embankment
was
sweet
with
a
tangle
of
wild
honeysuckle
and
led
straight
to
the
little
where
his
morning
mail
awaited
him
the
other
would
take
him
a
mile
out
of
his
way
but
it
was
through
a
thick
beech
woods
and
the
cool
leafage
of
its
green
aisles
tempted
him
a
darting
on
ahead
suddenly
decided
his
course
for
following
some
quick
impulse
as
if
the
cardinal
wings
had
beckoned
him
he
turned
off
the
highway
into
the
woods
i
might
as
well
go
around
and
have
a
look
at
that
lindsey
cabin
he
said
to
himself
as
an
excuse
for
turning
aside
if
it
in
as
good
shape
as
i
think
it
is
maybe
i
can
persuade
the
van
allens
to
rent
it
for
the
summer
it
a
pity
to
have
a
picturesque
place
like
that
standing
empty
when
it
has
such
possibilities
for
hospitality
and
the
van
allen
girls
a
positive
genius
for
giving
jolly
to
get
that
family
out
to
lloydsboro
for
the
summer
would
be
paving
the
way
to
no
end
of
good
times
the
farther
he
rode
into
the
cool
woods
the
better
the
idea
pleased
him
and
where
the
crossed
a
narrow
creek
he
paused
a
moment
before
plunging
down
the
bank
somewhere
up
the
ravine
a
spring
was
trickling
out
in
a
ceaseless
flow
he
could
not
see
it
but
he
could
hear
the
gurgle
of
the
water
as
cold
and
crystal
clear
it
splashed
down
into
its
rocky
basin
they
could
picnic
here
to
their
hearts
content
he
said
aloud
glancing
up
and
down
the
ravine
at
the
rank
growth
of
fern
and
maidenhair
which
festooned
the
rocks
alex
shelby
had
spent
only
part
of
two
summers
in
lloydsboro
valley
but
the
woodsy
smell
of
mint
and
pennyroyal
mingling
with
the
fern
brought
back
the
recollection
of
at
least
a
dozen
picnics
he
had
enjoyed
near
this
spot
most
of
them
moonlight
affairs
and
all
of
them
so
pleasant
that
he
was
determined
to
bring
about
their
repetition
if
possible
of
course
this
summer
he
would
not
have
as
much
time
for
outings
as
he
had
had
then
now
that
he
had
finished
his
medical
course
he
intended
to
shoulder
as
much
as
possible
of
his
uncle
work
the
old
practice
had
grown
far
too
heavy
for
him
but
at
the
same
time
there
need
be
no
limit
to
the
pleasant
things
that
the
summer
could
bring
forth
especially
if
the
van
allen
family
could
be
installed
in
the
lindsey
cabin
a
quarter
of
a
mile
more
brought
him
almost
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
to
the
beginning
of
the
lindsey
place
the
spacious
log
cabin
standing
back
among
the
great
forest
trees
might
have
been
a
relic
of
daniel
boone
day
so
carefully
had
his
pioneer
pattern
been
copied
by
skilful
architects
but
the
resemblance
was
only
outward
inside
it
was
luxuriously
equipped
with
every
modern
convenience
for
a
year
it
had
stood
and
alex
shelby
never
passed
it
without
regretting
that
such
a
charming
old
place
should
be
abandoned
to
dust
and
spiders
the
last
time
he
had
gone
by
it
he
had
noticed
that
it
was
beginning
to
show
the
effect
of
its
long
neglect
some
of
the
windows
were
completely
overgrown
by
ragged
and
virginia
creeper
and
a
tin
waterspout
that
had
blown
loose
from
its
fastenings
dangled
from
the
eaves
now
as
he
came
near
he
saw
in
surprise
that
the
place
seemed
to
have
an
alert
live
air
as
if
just
awakened
from
sleep
the
windows
were
all
thrown
open
the
vines
were
trimmed
and
were
a
mass
of
bloom
the
dead
leaves
were
raked
neatly
in
piles
and
the
cobwebs
no
longer
hung
from
the
cornices
in
dusty
festoons
a
long
ladder
leaning
against
the
front
of
the
house
rested
on
the
sill
of
an
upper
window
and
alex
wondered
if
the
agents
had
painters
at
work
he
hoped
so
the
more
thorough
the
renovation
the
more
attractive
it
would
be
to
the
van
allens
suddenly
his
pleased
expression
changed
to
one
of
surprise
and
dismay
as
he
saw
that
the
place
was
already
inhabited
empty
excelsior
and
wrapping
paper
littered
the
front
porch
a
new
hammock
hung
between
the
posts
somebody
lay
on
the
steps
moreover
a
slender
girl
in
a
white
dress
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
evidently
about
to
ascend
for
she
shook
it
to
test
its
balance
and
then
cautiously
stepped
up
on
the
first
round
her
back
was
toward
alex
and
he
fervently
hoped
that
she
would
turn
around
so
that
he
might
see
her
face
then
more
fervently
hoped
that
she
would
since
it
would
be
somewhat
embarrassing
to
be
caught
staring
as
inquisitively
as
he
was
doing
unconsciously
at
sight
of
her
he
had
brought
his
horse
to
a
standstill
and
now
sat
wondering
who
she
could
be
and
what
she
was
about
to
do
it
was
as
if
a
curtain
had
gone
up
on
the
first
scene
of
an
intensely
interesting
play
and
for
the
moment
he
forgot
everything
else
in
admiration
of
the
stage
setting
and
the
graceful
little
figure
poised
on
the
ladder
probably
going
up
for
an
armful
of
roses
he
thought
hold
tight
allison
do
let
it
slip
she
called
in
a
high
sweet
voice
almost
as
if
she
were
singing
the
words
and
alex
noticed
for
the
first
time
a
small
coloured
girl
behind
the
ladder
bracing
herself
against
it
to
hold
it
steady
the
ascent
was
a
slow
one
twice
she
tripped
on
her
skirts
and
with
a
little
shriek
almost
slipped
through
between
the
rounds
only
one
hand
was
free
for
climbing
the
other
grasped
some
dark
object
that
seemed
to
be
a
picture
frame
though
why
one
should
be
carrying
a
picture
frame
up
the
outside
of
a
house
was
more
than
the
young
man
could
imagine
and
he
concluded
he
must
be
mistaken
illustration
the
other
grasped
some
dark
object
that
seemed
to
be
a
picture
frame
the
last
step
brought
her
head
on
a
level
with
the
second
story
window
and
up
where
the
sun
struck
through
the
trees
in
a
broad
shaft
of
light
her
hair
had
been
beautiful
in
the
shadow
a
rare
tint
of
auburn
with
bronze
gold
glints
but
now
in
the
sunshine
it
was
an
aureole
what
was
it
it
reminded
him
of
a
fragment
of
a
poem
came
to
his
mind
although
he
was
not
given
to
remembering
such
things
sandalphon
the
angel
of
glory
sandalphon
the
angel
of
prayer
then
he
almost
laughed
aloud
at
the
comparison
for
a
dazzling
flash
of
light
blinding
him
for
an
instant
was
reflected
into
his
eyes
from
the
object
she
carried
and
he
saw
that
it
was
a
that
she
was
taking
up
the
ladder
with
such
care
what
a
very
human
and
very
feminine
angel
of
glory
it
is
he
thought
but
the
next
instant
still
with
the
amused
smile
on
his
face
he
was
spurring
his
horse
down
the
road
as
fast
as
it
could
gallop
the
girl
on
the
ladder
had
caught
sight
of
his
reflection
in
the
mirror
as
she
reached
up
to
lay
it
on
the
window
sill
and
had
turned
a
startled
face
towards
him
not
for
worlds
would
he
have
had
her
know
that
he
had
been
so
discourteous
as
to
sit
staring
at
her
he
had
forgotten
himself
in
the
interest
of
the
moment
eager
to
find
out
who
the
new
tenants
were
at
the
lindsey
cabin
he
rode
rapidly
on
turning
from
the
woodland
road
into
a
avenue
leading
back
to
the
just
as
he
made
the
turn
another
surprise
confronted
him
he
almost
collided
with
two
girls
who
were
hurrying
along
arm
in
arm
under
a
red
parasol
both
lloyd
sherman
and
kitty
walton
were
old
friends
of
his
but
he
had
to
look
twice
to
assure
himself
that
he
saw
aright
they
had
been
away
at
school
all
year
and
he
had
not
heard
of
their
return
i
thought
you
were
still
at
warwick
hall
he
exclaimed
dismounting
and
stepping
forward
with
bared
head
to
shake
hands
in
his
most
cordial
way
when
did
you
get
home
only
this
mawning
answered
lloyd
all
the
commencement
exercises
were
ovah
last
thursday
and
we
school
girls
no
longah
the
alps
lies
italy
kitty
can
tell
you
all
about
it
for
she
had
the
valedictory
kitty
met
alex
amused
smile
with
a
flash
of
her
black
eyes
but
before
she
could
deny
having
used
the
trite
subject
that
had
been
so
popular
in
the
old
lloydsboro
seminary
as
to
have
become
a
standing
joke
alex
answered
well
you
certainly
lost
no
time
in
starting
out
to
explore
the
wide
world
that
lies
before
you
i
always
heard
that
there
nothing
to
equal
the
zeal
of
a
sweet
girl
graduate
about
to
scale
her
alps
you
barely
reached
home
have
been
off
the
cars
three
hours
i
bet
and
yet
here
you
are
on
the
again
what
italy
are
you
climbing
after
now
ordinarily
his
banter
would
have
been
promptly
resented
by
both
girls
but
now
it
served
only
to
recall
the
amazing
news
that
had
sent
them
hurrying
away
from
the
on
an
excited
quest
with
a
dramatic
gesture
kitty
drew
a
letter
from
her
belt
and
held
it
out
to
him
think
of
it
she
exclaimed
her
cheeks
pink
with
excitement
gay
melville
here
in
the
valley
right
here
in
lloydsboro
settled
in
the
lindsey
cabin
for
the
summer
and
we
did
know
anything
about
it
till
ten
minutes
ago
gay
melville
repeated
alex
instantly
alert
at
mention
of
the
cabin
oh
he
does
know
her
kitty
interposed
lloyd
he
was
out
in
the
valley
the
wintah
she
spent
her
christmas
vacation
with
you
then
you
something
to
live
for
declared
kitty
with
emphasis
she
one
of
the
old
warwick
hall
girls
was
in
last
year
class
with
allison
and
betty
and
she
just
the
sweetest
dearest
do
tell
him
any
moah
interrupted
lloyd
let
him
find
out
for
himself
what
she
doing
at
the
lindsey
cabin
he
asked
he
kept
a
straight
face
although
inwardly
chuckling
over
the
fact
that
he
knew
well
enough
what
she
was
doing
at
least
what
she
had
been
doing
three
minutes
ago
they
taken
it
for
the
summer
that
is
her
sister
lucy
and
husband
have
and
jameson
harcourt
they
from
san
antonio
and
you
know
the
lindseys
spend
their
winters
there
it
seems
they
interested
harcourt
in
the
cabin
and
of
course
gay
was
wild
to
get
back
to
the
valley
and
she
persuaded
them
to
come
she
wrote
to
me
just
as
soon
as
it
was
decided
but
the
letter
never
reached
me
till
this
morning
she
thought
i
would
get
it
before
i
started
home
but
it
just
like
gay
to
mix
up
her
address
with
mine
she
was
so
excited
when
she
wrote
that
she
addressed
it
to
warwick
hall
station
texas
instead
of
district
of
columbia
it
has
been
travelling
all
over
the
country
and
it
a
wonder
that
it
ever
reached
me
at
all
and
the
worst
of
it
is
added
lloyd
of
she
expected
we
all
be
heah
to
meet
her
but
we
stayed
ovah
in
washington
two
days
and
when
they
came
in
last
night
there
was
a
soul
at
the
station
to
welcome
them
the
ticket
agent
told
me
about
it
just
now
as
we
came
past
she
seemed
surprised
he
said
and
disappointed
she
must
have
thought
it
queah
that
none
of
us
were
there
wo
she
be
funny
when
she
found
what
a
mistake
she
made
exclaimed
kitty
she
always
making
mistakes
and
is
always
perfectly
ridiculous
over
them
when
she
finds
it
out
we
going
to
take
you
to
call
on
her
alex
just
as
soon
as
they
settled
she
plays
the
violin
divinely
i
go
right
back
with
you
now
he
offered
promptly
no
you
wo
they
cried
in
the
same
breath
and
kitty
explained
no
telling
what
sort
of
a
mess
they
be
in
with
their
unpacking
but
if
they
ready
to
see
company
by
night
i
telephone
to
you
and
all
go
over
i
shall
live
only
for
that
moment
he
declared
laughing
then
added
as
he
turned
to
mount
his
horse
i
mighty
glad
i
met
you
and
more
than
glad
that
you
both
come
home
to
stay
a
flourish
of
the
red
parasol
answered
the
courtly
sweep
of
his
hat
as
they
parted
he
rode
on
rapidly
towards
the
wondering
if
they
would
find
the
girlish
figure
still
perched
on
the
ladder
up
among
the
roses
with
the
sun
making
an
aureole
of
her
shining
hair
he
had
never
seen
such
hair
sandalphon
the
angel
of
glory
but
the
quotation
broke
off
with
a
laugh
her
name
was
gay
and
it
was
a
looking
glass
that
she
was
carrying
up
the
ladder
well
an
original
little
thing
he
mused
and
if
she
lives
up
to
her
name
the
lindsey
cabin
will
be
just
as
lively
a
social
centre
as
if
the
van
allen
girls
had
possession
the
encounter
with
alex
had
delayed
the
girls
but
a
moment
or
two
still
they
walked
on
faster
than
ever
to
make
up
the
lost
time
what
do
you
suppose
we
find
her
doing
queried
lloyd
something
unexpected
i
be
bound
was
the
answer
will
you
ever
forget
that
first
time
we
saw
her
when
she
came
out
to
play
the
violin
at
the
freshman
reception
such
a
pretty
white
dress
and
that
rapt
uplifted
look
on
her
face
that
makes
you
think
of
cecilias
and
seraphim
and
with
one
foot
in
a
white
kid
shoe
and
the
other
in
that
awful
old
red
felt
bedroom
slipper
edged
in
black
fur
or
the
time
she
lost
her
belt
in
washington
suggested
lloyd
probably
we
find
her
unpacking
if
the
trunks
came
but
gay
trunks
nevah
were
known
to
arrive
on
time
we
may
have
to
be
lending
her
shirtwaists
and
collahs
for
a
month
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
rustic
footbridge
leading
over
a
ravine
to
the
cabin
and
were
in
full
view
of
the
front
windows
gay
was
still
on
the
ladder
she
had
made
several
trips
up
and
down
it
since
alex
passed
it
was
hard
to
decide
at
what
angle
to
hang
the
mirror
on
the
window
casing
as
she
had
seen
them
in
old
dutch
houses
in
holland
and
in
marking
the
place
with
the
point
of
the
only
nail
that
she
had
provided
on
which
to
hang
the
mirror
she
dropped
the
nail
several
minutes
had
been
wasted
in
a
fruitless
search
for
it
others
were
to
be
had
for
the
pulling
if
one
could
extract
them
from
the
empty
but
no
hammer
could
be
found
on
the
premises
and
it
was
only
after
much
twisting
and
struggling
that
the
little
coloured
girl
finally
managed
to
pull
one
with
her
teeth
another
five
minutes
had
been
wasted
in
searching
for
something
with
which
to
drive
the
nail
then
gay
gingerly
ascended
the
ladder
again
armed
with
a
pair
of
heavy
old
tongs
taken
from
the
porch
fireplace
she
had
just
reached
the
top
of
the
ladder
when
the
girls
caught
sight
of
her
mercy
exclaimed
kitty
in
a
low
tone
it
never
do
in
the
world
to
appear
at
juncture
she
pretty
sure
to
drop
through
the
ladder
anyhow
or
upset
herself
or
have
some
exhibition
of
the
usual
melville
luck
even
if
she
left
to
herself
and
if
she
should
suddenly
discover
us
there
no
telling
what
dreadful
thing
might
happen
let
slip
up
behind
the
arbour
and
watch
till
she
safely
down
to
earth
whispered
lloyd
what
you
suppose
she
trying
to
do
and
where
do
you
suppose
she
managed
to
pick
up
allison
sh
was
the
answer
that
the
dutch
mirror
she
got
in
amsterdam
last
summer
she
wrote
that
it
was
the
triumph
of
her
life
when
she
got
home
with
it
whole
she
carried
it
all
the
way
instead
of
packing
it
in
her
trunk
listen
what
that
she
saying
the
words
floated
down
to
them
distinctly
allison
you
have
to
get
me
something
besides
these
tongs
to
drive
this
nail
with
i
might
as
well
try
to
do
it
with
a
pair
of
stilts
besides
it
making
dents
in
them
and
it
wicked
to
spoil
such
beautiful
old
brasses
mercy
get
up
she
shrieked
wildly
as
the
shifting
of
small
body
made
the
ladder
slip
a
trifle
wait
till
i
poke
these
tongs
through
the
window
and
take
hold
with
both
hands
now
hunt
around
and
find
me
a
stone
or
a
piece
of
brick
the
girls
behind
the
arbour
could
not
see
her
face
but
the
sight
of
the
familiar
little
figure
clinging
to
the
ladder
and
the
sound
of
the
beloved
voice
made
them
long
to
rush
out
and
squeeze
her
is
her
hair
a
glory
up
there
in
the
sunshine
whispered
kitty
the
idea
of
anybody
calling
it
plain
red
such
a
fluff
of
bronzy
auburn
with
all
those
little
crinkles
of
gold
and
listen
to
that
whistle
you
think
it
was
a
real
mocking
bird
wholly
unconscious
of
her
audience
gay
teetered
on
the
ladder
whistling
and
trilling
like
a
happy
bobolink
until
the
little
black
girl
climbed
up
after
her
with
a
brick
which
she
had
dug
out
from
the
well
curb
the
girls
waited
until
the
nail
was
securely
in
place
the
mirror
hung
and
gay
had
begun
to
crawl
down
the
ladder
backward
before
they
rushed
out
from
their
they
pounced
upon
her
just
as
she
reached
the
bottom
round
and
then
ensued
what
kitty
called
a
an
enthusiastic
welcome
known
only
to
old
school
chums
who
have
been
separated
so
long
a
time
as
a
whole
twelvemonth
questions
answers
explanations
a
bubbling
over
of
delight
at
once
more
being
together
kept
them
talking
all
at
once
for
nearly
ten
minutes
then
gay
remembering
her
duty
as
hostess
led
the
way
into
the
house
come
in
and
see
lucy
and
her
fond
spouse
she
exclaimed
still
at
breakfast
although
it
ten
none
of
us
could
make
a
fire
in
the
range
it
simply
would
burn
but
we
had
brought
a
chafing
dish
in
one
of
the
boxes
and
we
found
another
in
the
pantry
and
they
been
mussing
around
for
the
last
two
hours
with
them
having
the
time
of
their
lives
lucy
made
fudge
and
omelette
and
tea
for
her
breakfast
being
the
things
she
knows
best
how
to
make
and
brother
jameson
is
trying
and
coffee
what
did
you
have
asked
lloyd
i
oh
i
emulated
the
example
of
old
person
of
crewd
who
said
use
sawdust
for
food
it
cheap
by
the
ton
and
it
nourishes
one
and
that
the
main
object
of
food
i
munched
a
handful
of
some
sort
of
new
breakfast
straw
but
it
very
satisfying
and
i
was
just
going
in
to
get
a
cup
of
brother
jameson
coffee
i
told
him
to
put
my
name
in
the
pot
come
on
in
and
have
some
too
throwing
open
the
door
she
began
a
series
of
breezy
introductions
that
set
them
all
to
laughing
and
swept
away
every
vestige
of
formality
both
lloyd
and
kitty
protested
against
taking
a
single
mouthful
at
that
hour
but
the
young
host
poured
out
a
cup
of
very
muddy
coffee
with
such
a
beaming
smile
and
the
little
bride
offered
a
very
bitter
cup
of
tea
in
competition
with
a
merry
insistence
so
like
gay
that
they
could
not
refuse
it
going
to
be
lovely
kitty
managed
to
whisper
under
cover
of
the
bustle
of
bringing
in
more
hot
water
they
almost
as
and
as
gay
herself
and
jameson
looks
as
if
he
might
be
the
man
youngest
brother
these
in
the
wood
would
have
perished
but
for
me
began
gay
who
was
rattling
along
as
if
she
were
wound
up
was
the
robin
who
came
to
the
rescue
i
went
over
to
stumptown
bright
and
early
you
see
i
remembered
the
short
cut
through
the
woods
and
as
luck
would
have
it
found
some
one
willing
to
come
at
the
very
first
house
where
i
inquired
but
she
ca
come
till
nearly
noon
hence
this
disorderly
feasting
and
rioting
allison
was
swinging
on
the
gate
with
her
finger
in
her
mouth
i
did
know
her
but
she
remembered
me
and
complimented
me
by
asking
if
i
done
brought
my
fiddle
along
i
think
i
engage
her
for
the
summer
for
my
little
she
as
quick
as
a
monkey
and
would
look
so
cunning
diked
up
in
a
cap
and
apron
what
that
rhyme
betty
made
about
her
when
she
was
at
her
own
mother
wedding
oh
by
the
way
where
betty
why
did
she
come
with
you
for
the
good
reason
that
we
did
know
we
were
coming
heah
ourselves
when
we
left
home
answered
lloyd
betty
went
on
to
commencement
with
all
the
rest
of
the
family
but
it
was
hard
for
her
to
tear
herself
away
from
her
beloved
writing
we
had
been
back
at
locust
half
an
houah
this
mawning
till
she
was
at
it
again
betty
is
sherman
explained
gay
in
an
aside
to
her
the
one
who
i
told
you
is
such
a
genius
she
writing
a
book
then
turning
to
lloyd
it
is
that
same
old
one
she
was
at
work
on
at
school
is
it
no
it
something
she
began
last
fall
mothah
wanted
her
to
make
her
début
in
louisville
when
she
was
through
school
just
as
i
am
going
to
do
next
wintah
but
betty
begged
to
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
country
she
said
she
nevah
be
a
brilliant
success
socially
but
that
she
do
her
best
to
be
a
credit
to
the
family
in
some
other
way
she
will
too
prophesied
gay
some
day
we
all
be
proud
of
the
little
you
rescued
from
the
cuckoo
nest
dear
old
betty
like
to
hug
her
this
very
minute
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
was
striking
eleven
when
they
rose
from
the
table
but
gay
would
not
listen
when
the
girls
attempted
to
take
their
leave
you
have
seen
my
room
she
insisted
nor
my
mirror
come
on
up
stairs
and
look
into
my
mirror
it
the
joy
of
my
heart
and
maybe
we
all
see
our
fate
in
it
i
like
to
pretend
that
it
a
sort
of
magic
glass
that
some
wizard
of
the
wood
has
laid
a
spell
on
it
so
that
at
certain
times
all
the
figures
that
have
ever
been
reflected
in
it
must
march
across
it
again
would
it
be
lovely
if
all
the
good
times
it
is
going
to
reflect
this
summer
could
be
made
to
pass
over
it
again
whenever
i
wanted
to
recall
them
we
lead
the
procession
announced
kitty
for
we
were
the
first
objects
that
crossed
the
path
after
you
got
it
hung
if
we
were
not
group
of
damsels
glad
we
were
at
least
a
couple
of
them
but
you
were
not
the
first
confessed
gay
just
as
i
held
it
up
to
adjust
it
i
had
such
a
thrillingly
romantic
experience
that
i
nearly
fell
off
the
ladder
it
showed
me
the
reflection
of
an
awfully
good
looking
young
man
on
but
when
i
turned
to
look
over
my
shoulder
at
the
original
he
was
galloping
down
the
road
like
a
blue
streak
i
wondah
who
it
could
have
been
mused
lloyd
we
met
alex
shelby
on
hawseback
just
a
few
minutes
befoah
we
got
heah
but
he
nevah
said
a
word
about
having
seen
anybody
and
he
seemed
surprised
when
we
told
him
that
the
cabin
had
been
rented
they
were
up
in
gay
room
now
and
running
to
the
window
kitty
seated
herself
in
the
low
chair
beside
it
oh
how
fine
she
called
it
at
exactly
the
right
angle
for
i
can
see
everything
along
the
path
without
looking
out
it
be
a
sort
of
hildegarde
mirror
wo
it
like
the
lady
of
shalott
half
under
her
breath
she
began
to
recite
the
lines
they
had
learned
so
long
ago
and
from
force
of
habit
lloyd
joined
the
chant
and
moving
through
the
mirror
clear
that
hangs
before
her
all
the
year
shadows
of
the
world
appear
smiling
to
see
how
well
they
remembered
it
they
went
on
in
unison
down
to
the
couplet
and
sometimes
through
the
mirror
blue
the
knights
come
riding
two
by
two
there
kitty
broke
off
to
say
i
do
see
how
that
can
happen
here
summer
it
will
be
sheer
luck
if
they
come
even
in
singles
there
never
were
so
few
boys
left
in
the
valley
and
it
too
bad
to
have
it
happen
so
the
summer
that
you
here
nearly
everybody
is
going
away
you
can
count
on
the
fingers
of
one
hand
the
few
who
will
stay
what
about
the
two
knights
of
kentucky
asked
gay
you
a
lucky
girl
kitty
to
have
two
such
splendid
cousins
as
keith
and
malcolm
macintyre
they
are
already
gone
they
sailed
for
england
with
uncle
sydney
and
aunt
elise
last
week
you
know
i
wrote
you
they
were
going
and
that
allison
was
to
be
in
the
party
too
and
oh
gay
did
you
get
that
letter
then
you
have
heard
the
most
important
thing
of
all
is
engaged
it
did
happen
till
a
few
days
before
they
sailed
and
it
is
announced
yet
but
of
course
she
wanted
you
to
know
and
i
wrote
to
you
right
away
gay
bounced
out
of
her
chair
as
if
a
bomb
exploded
in
the
room
oh
you
do
mean
it
she
cried
tragically
clasping
her
hands
why
she
only
been
out
of
school
a
year
the
first
of
our
class
to
go
oh
tell
me
all
about
it
begin
at
the
beginning
and
do
skip
a
thing
throwing
herself
down
on
the
floor
at
kitty
feet
she
propped
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
her
elbows
in
kitty
lap
prepared
to
listen
there
is
much
to
tell
you
know
the
fortune
that
mammy
easter
predicted
for
her
was
nice
but
it
was
very
exciting
she
was
to
wid
de
quality
and
ride
in
her
well
his
family
is
certainly
quality
the
claibornes
of
virginia
and
she
live
in
washington
and
have
several
kinds
of
carriages
is
it
odd
we
knew
him
when
he
was
just
a
boy
he
was
on
the
same
transport
with
us
when
we
went
to
the
philippines
and
we
never
imagined
then
that
we
ever
see
him
again
but
i
thought
that
that
young
lieutenant
logan
began
gay
kitty
interrupted
her
with
a
laugh
why
my
dear
he
is
a
mere
compared
to
raleigh
claiborne
that
little
affair
was
the
mere
a
of
romance
he
paying
attention
to
our
youngest
now
he
sends
music
and
bon
bons
to
think
of
elise
being
old
enough
to
receive
such
attentions
groaned
gay
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
patriarch
but
never
mind
my
hoary
sensations
go
on
and
tell
me
some
more
she
going
to
get
her
trousseau
abroad
i
suppose
only
part
of
it
for
the
wedding
is
to
take
place
for
a
year
allison
did
care
much
about
going
thought
she
rather
wait
and
take
the
trip
with
raleigh
but
he
is
so
busy
it
may
be
several
years
before
he
can
get
off
for
a
whole
summer
and
aunt
elise
persuaded
her
to
go
with
them
she
said
it
would
be
so
easy
for
her
to
go
when
she
once
assumed
the
responsibility
of
a
big
establishment
gay
clasped
her
hands
around
her
knees
and
rocked
herself
back
and
forth
on
the
floor
i
glad
she
sensible
enough
to
wait
a
year
she
declared
i
see
why
girls
are
in
such
a
hurry
to
tie
themselves
up
in
a
knot
i
suppose
it
perfectly
fascinating
to
be
engaged
and
to
have
the
choosing
of
a
lovely
trousseau
and
the
opening
of
all
the
wedding
presents
everybody
takes
so
much
interest
in
a
prospective
bride
but
the
fun
comes
to
an
end
so
quickly
it
like
fourth
of
july
fire
works
there
a
big
blaze
and
excitement
while
it
lasts
then
it
all
over
and
they
settle
down
to
be
just
prosy
married
people
i
should
think
that
the
reaction
would
be
deadly
and
that
if
a
girl
could
see
past
the
time
of
the
rocket
shooting
up
and
realize
that
it
stay
among
the
stars
but
must
fall
to
earth
again
with
a
dull
thud
she
profit
by
other
people
experiences
and
not
give
up
all
the
good
times
of
her
girlhood
before
she
half
enjoyed
them
gay
spoke
so
feelingly
that
her
two
listeners
exchanged
glances
of
surprise
this
was
not
the
way
gay
had
been
wont
to
talk
a
year
ago
and
each
wondered
to
herself
if
lucy
marriage
had
caused
this
radical
change
in
her
opinion
suddenly
she
changed
the
subject
with
the
unexpectedness
of
a
grasshopper
leap
which
one
of
you
girls
is
going
to
stay
all
night
with
me
kitty
answered
first
neither
of
us
ought
to
for
we
only
just
returned
to
the
bosom
of
our
families
you
could
hardly
call
us
entirely
arrived
yet
for
our
trunks
have
come
lloyd
started
up
and
looked
at
her
watch
in
alarm
it
a
good
thing
you
reminded
me
that
i
have
a
home
she
laughed
i
told
mothah
just
stroll
down
to
the
and
be
right
back
and
when
i
met
kitty
with
yoah
lettah
it
drove
everything
else
out
of
my
head
be
wondering
what
has
happened
to
me
i
come
some
night
next
week
and
be
glad
to
no
one
of
you
has
to
come
back
and
stay
with
me
gay
insisted
so
settle
it
between
yourselves
you
may
as
well
draw
straws
to
decide
which
is
to
be
my
victim
then
glancing
around
the
room
i
do
happen
to
see
any
straws
at
hand
but
you
might
pull
hairs
for
the
honour
here
my
head
is
at
your
service
ladies
dropping
to
her
knees
she
made
a
profound
salaam
and
waited
for
them
to
draw
the
one
who
pulls
the
shortest
hair
comes
back
laughing
over
the
absurd
manner
of
deciding
such
a
matter
each
girl
reached
out
and
plucked
a
hair
by
its
roots
so
vigorously
that
the
pull
was
followed
by
a
long
drawn
ouch
mine
the
shortest
giggled
lloyd
comparing
it
with
the
one
that
kitty
held
up
but
i
suah
my
family
will
object
if
i
propose
leaving
them
the
very
first
night
of
my
arrival
aftah
i
been
away
at
school
all
yeah
do
leave
them
then
said
gay
bring
them
all
over
here
to
spend
the
evening
i
wild
for
lucy
and
brother
jameson
to
meet
them
as
soon
as
possible
then
when
bedtime
comes
let
them
leave
you
tell
them
that
kitty
is
going
to
bring
all
her
family
and
that
everybody
in
the
valley
who
is
anybody
is
coming
to
the
harcourt
housewarming
at
the
in
the
wood
kitty
began
unfurling
her
red
parasol
that
certainly
sounds
alluring
you
can
count
on
all
my
family
especially
ranald
and
i
go
straight
home
and
telephone
to
alex
shelby
who
may
he
be
inquired
gay
scrambling
up
from
the
floor
to
follow
her
guests
down
stairs
kitty
began
an
enthusiastic
description
of
him
which
lloyd
cut
short
with
the
laughing
remark
go
look
in
your
little
dutch
mirror
i
not
positive
but
i
he
yoah
first
of
the
chapter
ii
confidences
that
night
a
series
of
interesting
shadows
trooped
across
the
little
dutch
mirror
in
the
moonlight
but
nobody
watched
beside
it
to
see
how
faithfully
it
reflected
the
procession
of
guests
straggling
up
the
path
below
after
the
first
pleased
glance
gay
had
flown
to
throw
open
the
front
door
and
bid
them
welcome
it
was
almost
more
than
she
had
dared
to
hope
that
the
old
colonel
would
come
and
papa
jack
and
kitty
grandmother
macintyre
but
they
had
needed
no
urging
gay
was
reaping
the
aftermath
now
of
her
first
visit
to
the
valley
they
had
not
forgotten
the
obliging
little
guest
who
had
entertained
them
with
her
violin
playing
amused
them
with
her
quaint
unexpected
speeches
and
charmed
old
and
young
alike
with
her
enthusiastic
interest
in
everything
and
everybody
ranald
had
more
than
that
to
remember
for
he
had
carried
on
a
vigorous
correspondence
with
gay
for
the
last
six
months
started
by
a
dare
from
allison
alex
shelby
memory
of
her
dated
back
only
to
that
morning
but
the
picture
of
a
sunny
little
head
up
among
the
roses
and
that
line
sandalphon
the
angel
of
glory
had
been
in
his
thoughts
all
day
their
effort
to
show
the
newcomers
how
cordial
a
lloydsboro
welcome
could
be
was
met
by
a
hospitality
which
held
them
in
its
spell
till
after
midnight
lucy
was
in
her
element
as
the
popular
daughter
of
a
popular
army
officer
she
had
played
gracious
hostess
ever
since
she
had
learned
to
talk
as
for
gay
so
anxious
was
she
that
her
friends
should
be
pleased
with
her
family
and
her
family
with
her
friends
that
she
threw
herself
with
all
her
might
into
the
task
of
making
each
show
off
to
the
other
an
outside
on
the
broad
front
porch
was
one
of
the
features
of
the
cabin
the
june
night
was
cool
enough
to
make
the
blaze
on
its
hearth
acceptable
and
lucy
turned
the
picturesque
old
kettle
bubbling
on
the
crane
to
practical
use
making
coffee
to
serve
with
the
which
jameson
handed
around
on
long
sticks
that
each
one
might
toast
his
own
over
the
glowing
coals
the
informality
of
it
all
and
the
good
cheer
made
every
one
relax
into
his
jolliest
mood
and
gay
hearing
the
old
colonel
laugh
as
stretched
out
on
the
settle
by
the
fire
he
told
stories
and
toasted
with
a
zest
felt
that
they
had
struck
the
right
in
this
first
evening
entertainment
it
was
the
harbinger
of
many
others
that
would
follow
during
the
summer
it
was
her
violin
that
held
them
longest
standing
just
inside
the
door
where
kitty
could
accompany
her
on
the
piano
she
played
one
after
another
of
the
favourite
tunes
that
were
called
for
in
turn
till
the
fire
burned
low
on
the
porch
hearth
and
even
the
voices
of
the
night
were
stilled
in
the
dense
beech
woods
around
the
cabin
it
was
later
than
any
one
had
supposed
when
sherman
made
the
discovery
that
the
hall
clock
had
stopped
she
did
know
that
i
stopped
it
on
purpose
confessed
gay
when
the
last
carriage
had
driven
away
and
lloyd
was
following
her
sleepily
she
paused
to
bolt
the
door
behind
them
this
has
been
a
lovely
evening
for
me
it
gives
one
such
a
comfortable
sort
of
feeling
to
have
everything
turn
out
as
you
prophesied
it
would
of
course
i
knew
that
lucy
would
feel
the
charm
of
the
valley
and
like
it
a
thousand
times
better
than
the
mountains
or
seashore
or
anywhere
else
but
i
was
so
sure
of
jameson
now
my
mind
is
completely
at
rest
for
the
summer
i
stopped
worrying
when
i
saw
him
hobnobbing
with
the
colonel
and
your
father
about
those
lexington
horses
he
wants
to
buy
he
was
so
tickled
over
those
letters
of
introduction
they
gave
him
and
he
was
so
charmed
to
air
his
knowledge
of
the
philippines
to
walton
he
spent
a
month
there
you
know
i
fairly
patted
myself
on
the
back
all
the
time
he
was
talking
somehow
i
feel
so
responsible
for
this
household
there
i
forgot
to
remind
them
to
bring
that
bothersome
old
silver
pitcher
upstairs
hastily
unbolting
the
door
she
called
out
in
sepulchral
tones
that
echoed
through
the
dark
house
the
maine
there
was
a
laugh
in
the
room
across
the
hall
then
her
who
had
just
come
shuffled
down
again
in
his
slippers
i
suppose
i
have
to
remind
them
every
night
this
summer
continued
gay
i
do
like
to
call
out
the
silver
pitcher
that
was
our
melville
and
the
soup
ladle
that
some
old
spanish
grandee
gave
to
one
of
jameson
castilian
ancestors
for
if
a
burglar
were
prowling
around
he
would
be
all
the
more
anxious
to
break
in
so
the
month
i
visited
them
before
we
came
here
i
adopted
that
slogan
for
my
the
thing
in
life
to
be
saved
from
burglars
it
always
sends
one
or
the
other
of
them
skipping
for
they
feel
the
responsibility
of
preserving
such
heirlooms
for
posterity
i
used
to
wish
that
i
were
the
oldest
daughter
so
that
that
pitcher
would
be
handed
down
to
me
on
my
wedding
day
i
did
realize
what
a
bore
it
would
be
to
be
tied
for
life
to
such
a
responsibility
i
asked
jameson
why
he
did
put
it
and
the
ladle
in
a
safety
vault
and
be
done
with
it
and
he
read
me
such
a
lecture
on
the
sacredness
of
old
associations
and
family
ties
that
i
somehow
felt
that
his
old
expected
me
to
send
it
a
written
apology
gay
had
bolted
the
door
again
and
as
she
talked
drew
the
curtains
across
the
casement
windows
now
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
shaking
out
her
wealth
of
sunny
hair
to
brush
and
braid
it
for
the
night
it
was
a
cosy
room
with
low
ceiling
and
wall
paper
with
the
curtains
drawn
and
the
candles
in
the
quaint
pewter
sticks
lighting
up
the
mahogany
furniture
it
was
an
ideal
place
for
the
exchanging
of
bedtime
confidences
gay
was
the
first
to
break
the
silence
what
was
the
matter
with
betty
tonight
she
was
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
hardly
had
a
word
to
say
and
all
the
time
i
was
playing
she
sat
looking
out
into
the
night
as
if
she
were
ready
to
cry
no
wondah
they
were
so
beautiful
some
of
those
nocturnes
and
things
that
we
all
had
lumps
in
our
throats
nothing
the
mattah
with
betty
it
just
the
last
chaptah
she
ca
get
to
suit
her
she
gone
around
in
a
sawt
of
dream
all
day
who
playing
the
devoted
to
her
now
nobody
as
far
as
i
know
the
boys
love
betty
they
been
perfectly
devoted
to
her
ever
since
she
came
to
locust
to
live
but
not
not
in
the
sentimental
way
you
mean
for
instance
the
way
that
alex
shelby
cares
for
kitty
oh
tell
me
there
is
anything
in
that
wailed
gay
at
least
on
kitty
part
for
i
set
my
heart
on
her
marrying
a
friend
of
mine
in
san
antonio
so
she
always
be
near
me
you
know
when
mammy
easter
told
her
fortune
it
was
that
her
fate
would
come
through
running
water
when
the
weather
vane
points
i
wild
to
have
her
visit
me
at
fort
sam
houston
next
year
and
this
frank
percival
is
the
very
one
of
all
others
for
her
he
a
banker
and
as
good
as
gold
and
oh
well
there
no
use
wasting
time
singing
his
praises
to
when
i
want
him
for
kitty
but
about
this
alex
shelby
kitty
told
me
this
very
afternoon
that
it
is
he
admires
so
much
she
told
me
all
about
that
bernice
howe
affair
and
said
that
ever
since
katie
mallard
up
and
told
him
how
honourably
you
acted
in
the
matter
he
has
put
you
on
a
pedestal
and
given
you
a
halo
she
said
you
could
have
him
crazy
about
you
if
so
much
as
lift
an
eyelash
in
encouragement
do
you
believe
it
cried
lloyd
that
just
kitty
way
of
throwing
you
off
the
track
we
been
unusually
good
friends
evah
since
he
found
out
why
i
broke
my
engagement
to
go
riding
with
him
but
he
is
at
the
beeches
every
bit
as
much
as
he
is
at
the
locusts
and
it
you
he
be
in
love
with
befoah
the
summah
is
ovah
he
was
the
first
one
reflected
in
yoah
looking
glass
for
he
confessed
this
evening
how
he
sat
and
watched
you
on
the
laddah
and
how
he
thought
of
you
all
day
and
he
even
quoted
poetry
about
it
and
that
a
very
serious
symptom
for
alex
to
show
he
nevah
was
known
to
do
such
things
befoah
then
tonight
he
was
simply
carried
away
by
yoah
playing
he
adores
a
violin
and
you
played
all
his
favourites
oh
i
see
yoah
finish
there
was
a
pause
in
which
gay
kicked
off
her
slippers
and
sat
absently
gazing
at
them
while
lloyd
tied
the
ribbons
which
fastened
the
lace
in
the
collar
of
her
dainty
gown
again
it
was
gay
who
spoke
first
does
it
seem
queer
to
think
of
allison
being
engaged
it
is
such
a
little
while
since
we
were
all
school
girls
together
nobody
knows
whose
turn
will
come
next
it
makes
me
feel
like
a
soldier
on
a
battle
field
comrades
being
shot
down
all
around
you
right
and
left
and
you
never
knowing
how
soon
it
be
your
turn
to
fall
it
awful
lloyd
what
become
of
that
boy
out
in
arizona
the
one
who
sent
you
those
in
joyce
letter
when
i
was
here
before
he
was
best
man
at
eugenia
forbes
wedding
oh
you
mean
phil
tremont
answered
lloyd
placidly
without
the
conscious
blush
that
gay
had
expected
to
see
he
is
out
west
again
doing
splendidly
eugenia
writes
i
thought
you
wrote
to
him
yourself
lloyd
stooping
to
pick
up
her
dress
and
hang
it
over
a
chair
did
not
see
with
what
keen
interest
gay
watched
her
as
she
questioned
oh
we
still
keep
up
a
sawt
of
hit
and
miss
correspondence
he
writes
every
few
weeks
and
i
manage
to
reply
once
in
two
months
or
so
dreadfully
uphill
work
for
me
to
write
to
people
whom
i
nevah
see
been
two
yeahs
since
he
was
heah
and
i
nevah
know
what
he
be
interested
in
i
suppose
it
easier
writing
to
some
one
you
known
all
your
life
like
malcolm
macintyre
for
instance
i
so
sorry
he
and
keith
are
abroad
this
summer
lloyd
face
dimpled
mischievously
as
she
began
to
see
the
drift
of
gay
questioning
i
ca
tell
you
how
easy
it
is
to
write
to
malcolm
because
i
nevah
done
it
now
it
my
turn
to
ask
questions
where
did
you
get
this
new
photograph
of
ranald
walton
on
yoah
dressing
table
beg
it
from
kitty
as
you
did
that
one
at
warwick
hall
when
he
was
a
little
cadet
or
get
it
from
headquartahs
direct
from
headquarters
confessed
gay
with
a
laugh
he
is
so
afraid
of
girls
as
he
used
to
be
was
he
charming
tonight
so
the
questioning
and
answering
went
on
for
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
each
anxious
to
find
how
far
the
other
had
drifted
into
the
unexplored
country
of
their
dreams
then
gay
blew
out
the
candles
and
climbed
into
the
high
bed
beside
lloyd
where
they
lay
looking
out
through
the
open
window
into
the
starlight
the
moon
had
been
down
for
some
time
it
was
so
still
here
in
the
heart
of
the
beech
woods
that
the
silence
could
almost
be
felt
the
girls
spoke
in
whispers
it
settles
down
on
one
like
a
pall
said
gay
are
you
sleepy
not
very
answered
lloyd
stifling
a
yawn
then
there
one
more
person
in
the
valley
i
want
to
ask
about
i
believe
i
heard
an
account
of
every
one
else
where
rob
moore
and
what
is
he
doing
i
thought
he
would
come
over
with
you
all
tonight
poah
old
rob
answered
lloyd
swallowing
another
yawn
his
fathah
died
a
little
ovah
a
yeah
ago
and
he
nevah
been
like
himself
since
he
seemed
to
grow
into
a
man
in
just
a
few
hours
it
was
awfully
sudden
mistah
moore
death
the
shock
neahly
killed
rob
mothah
and
the
deah
old
judge
his
grandfathah
you
know
was
simply
heartbroken
rob
just
gave
up
his
entire
time
to
them
aftah
that
he
was
such
a
comfort
nevah
left
the
place
and
took
charge
of
all
the
business
mattahs
to
spare
them
every
worry
when
things
were
settled
up
they
found
there
was
as
much
left
as
they
had
thought
there
would
be
and
rob
would
touch
a
cent
to
finish
his
law
course
he
was
afraid
his
mothah
would
have
to
deny
herself
some
luxury
she
had
always
been
used
to
and
he
did
want
her
to
miss
a
single
one
she
had
had
in
his
fathah
lifetime
so
he
took
a
position
in
louisville
and
has
been
working
like
a
dawg
evah
since
he
reads
law
at
night
with
the
old
judge
so
i
scarcely
evah
see
him
we
just
drifted
apart
till
it
seems
as
if
the
little
old
bobby
i
grew
up
with
is
dead
and
gone
i
missed
him
dreadfully
at
first
all
last
summah
for
he
almost
lived
at
our
house
and
was
just
like
a
brothah
i
have
seen
him
at
all
this
vacation
though
to
be
suah
i
only
been
home
this
one
day
in
the
dim
starlight
lloyd
could
not
see
the
complacent
smile
on
face
but
her
voice
showed
that
she
was
well
pleased
with
the
answers
to
her
string
of
questions
now
i
tell
you
why
i
put
you
through
such
a
catechism
she
began
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
coast
is
clear
so
that
you
can
undertake
a
mission
that
is
to
be
laid
at
your
door
this
summer
jameson
brother
leland
will
be
here
afternoon
if
he
takes
a
fancy
to
the
place
he
will
probably
stay
as
long
as
we
do
and
we
are
all
very
anxious
for
him
to
stay
he
only
three
years
younger
than
jameson
but
the
two
were
left
alone
in
the
world
when
they
were
just
little
tots
and
jameson
has
been
like
a
father
to
him
he
feels
so
responsible
for
him
and
so
does
lucy
i
do
too
now
although
he
only
my
brother
because
i
persuaded
them
to
come
here
for
the
summer
and
jameson
wanted
to
go
somewhere
where
leland
would
be
satisfied
to
stay
what
the
mattah
with
him
that
he
needs
so
much
looking
aftah
if
he
yeahs
old
it
seems
to
me
that
he
might
take
the
responsibility
of
himself
on
his
own
shouldahs
is
he
wild
no
jameson
says
he
always
been
too
to
do
the
things
men
mean
when
they
talk
about
sowing
their
wild
oats
but
he
is
as
utterly
irresponsible
as
a
he
wo
stay
tied
down
to
anything
just
drifts
around
here
and
there
having
a
good
time
it
a
pity
that
he
is
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
then
he
have
to
do
something
he
so
bright
he
easily
could
make
something
splendid
of
himself
now
jameson
has
good
sensible
ideas
about
not
squandering
his
money
and
although
he
does
have
to
work
any
more
than
leland
does
he
looks
after
the
details
of
his
own
business
as
a
man
should
he
knows
all
about
the
mines
he
has
stock
in
down
in
mexico
and
he
studies
mineralogy
and
labour
problems
and
investments
and
has
an
office
that
he
goes
to
regularly
every
morning
he
takes
after
his
father
side
of
the
house
practical
english
people
but
leland
is
like
his
mother
family
they
were
proud
old
spaniards
just
a
generation
or
so
back
he
is
adventurous
and
roving
and
romantic
and
has
the
far
in
the
blood
jameson
says
that
all
that
leland
needs
is
to
be
kept
keyed
up
to
the
right
pitch
for
he
is
so
impetuous
and
headstrong
that
he
always
gets
what
he
starts
after
no
matter
what
stands
in
the
way
and
that
if
he
could
just
fall
heels
over
head
in
love
with
some
girl
with
great
force
of
character
who
would
look
at
him
till
he
measured
up
to
her
standards
it
would
be
the
making
of
him
lloyd
yawned
excuse
me
for
saying
it
she
began
teasingly
but
i
do
see
how
you
can
get
up
so
much
interest
in
anybody
like
that
even
if
he
is
yoah
brothah
it
sounds
to
me
as
if
he
is
just
plain
and
i
nevah
did
have
any
use
for
a
man
that
had
to
be
nagged
all
the
time
to
keep
his
ambition
up
to
mark
gay
sat
up
in
bed
in
her
earnestness
oh
lloyd
do
say
that
she
protested
do
judge
him
till
you
seen
him
he
perfectly
dear
in
lots
of
ways
in
spite
of
his
faults
you
find
him
fascinating
everybody
does
and
i
going
to
be
entirely
honest
with
you
fairly
that
you
like
him
you
are
so
strong
yourself
the
strongest
character
of
any
girl
i
know
and
you
influence
people
so
forcibly
in
spite
of
themselves
that
i
felt
from
the
start
it
would
be
the
making
of
leland
if
you
take
him
in
hand
this
summer
lloyd
smothered
a
laugh
in
the
pillow
do
you
speak
for
yourself
john
she
said
mischievously
why
do
take
him
in
hand
you
are
already
interested
so
much
that
you
only
be
combining
pleasuah
with
duty
gay
was
too
much
in
earnest
to
tolerate
any
levity
and
went
on
in
her
intense
eager
way
oh
i
already
worn
myself
out
trying
to
influence
him
but
it
of
no
use
he
knows
me
too
well
he
called
me
and
ever
since
we
went
to
kindergarten
together
i
just
one
of
the
family
but
i
showed
him
your
picture
and
told
him
what
an
unapproachable
unattainable
creature
you
are
and
whetted
his
curiosity
till
it
as
keen
as
a
razor
oh
i
played
my
little
game
like
an
expert
and
he
does
suspect
in
the
faintest
degree
what
i
want
he
thinks
i
trying
to
interest
him
in
kitty
walton
i
told
him
she
the
darlingest
jolliest
prettiest
thing
in
ten
states
and
that
guarantee
he
would
feel
bored
once
this
entire
summer
if
he
make
her
acquaintance
but
you
i
painted
as
so
indifferent
and
entirely
above
his
reach
that
just
to
prove
to
me
i
mistaken
he
nearly
break
his
neck
to
put
himself
on
good
terms
with
you
it
just
as
jameson
says
ride
over
everything
that
stands
in
his
way
to
get
what
he
wants
lloyd
raised
herself
on
her
elbow
and
turned
a
protesting
face
towards
her
eloquent
well
of
all
cool
things
she
began
half
inclined
to
be
indignant
yet
so
amused
at
gay
masterly
management
that
the
exclamation
ended
in
a
giggle
where
do
come
in
pray
you
say
he
always
gets
what
he
goes
aftah
did
it
evah
occur
to
you
that
i
might
not
want
to
be
taken
possession
of
in
that
way
that
might
have
something
to
say
in
the
mattah
have
you
as
much
interest
in
my
welfare
as
in
yoah
sistah
husband
brothah
of
course
you
blessed
little
goose
exclaimed
gay
giving
the
arm
next
hers
an
impetuous
squeeze
do
i
know
the
haughty
princess
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
all
the
king
horses
and
all
the
king
men
could
budge
her
against
her
will
i
not
looking
ahead
any
farther
than
this
summer
but
if
you
could
just
shake
him
up
and
put
him
on
his
mettle
that
long
that
all
i
ask
of
you
and
seriously
dear
you
might
go
the
world
over
and
not
find
one
who
measures
up
to
your
ideals
in
more
ways
he
well
born
and
talented
and
rich
and
fairly
he
so
entertaining
one
never
tires
of
his
company
and
generous
to
a
fault
and
oh
lloyd
say
take
enough
interest
to
keep
him
keyed
up
to
the
right
pitch
for
awhile
it
all
he
lacks
to
make
a
splendid
man
do
you
know
i
think
that
a
mighty
big
lack
said
lloyd
honestly
i
had
strings
on
my
harp
that
would
stay
strung
it
the
most
exasperating
thing
in
the
world
you
know
how
it
is
with
a
violin
right
in
the
midst
of
the
loveliest
passages
one
will
begin
to
slip
back
just
a
trifle
maybe
not
more
than
a
hair
breadth
but
enough
to
make
it
flat
and
spoil
the
harmony
then
you
stop
and
tune
it
up
again
and
go
on
for
awhile
but
back
it
will
slip
just
when
gotten
to
depending
on
it
you
know
i
could
have
any
respect
for
a
man
who
had
to
be
kept
up
to
the
notch
that
way
it
would
spoil
the
whole
thing
to
have
him
flat
on
a
single
note
when
i
depended
on
him
to
ring
clear
and
true
gay
had
no
reply
ready
for
this
unexpected
argument
and
her
experience
with
stringed
instruments
made
it
very
forcible
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
answered
then
she
spoke
triumphantly
but
you
know
what
a
master
can
do
where
a
novice
would
fail
he
can
fit
the
keys
to
hold
any
position
he
gives
them
leland
has
never
felt
the
touch
of
a
no
one
has
ever
controlled
him
he
has
always
been
petted
and
spoiled
he
has
never
known
a
girl
like
you
i
sure
that
if
you
were
only
willing
to
make
the
attempt
to
arouse
his
pride
and
ambition
you
could
do
wonders
for
him
it
was
the
most
potent
appeal
gay
could
have
made
to
feel
that
her
influence
may
sway
a
man
to
higher
better
things
will
make
even
the
most
frivolous
girl
draw
quicker
breath
with
a
sense
of
power
and
to
a
conscientious
girl
like
lloyd
this
seemed
an
opportunity
and
a
responsibility
that
could
not
be
lightly
thrust
aside
well
she
said
finally
after
a
moment
of
hesitation
i
try
gay
reached
over
with
an
impulsive
kiss
oh
you
i
knew
you
would
now
i
can
let
you
go
to
sleep
in
peace
accomplished
something
done
has
earned
a
night
repose
it
must
be
awfully
late
goodnight
dear
long
after
gay
had
fallen
asleep
lloyd
lay
thinking
of
the
mission
thus
thrust
upon
her
if
this
leland
harcourt
had
needed
reforming
she
told
herself
she
would
have
had
anything
to
do
with
him
her
poor
violet
experience
with
ned
bannon
had
taught
her
one
lesson
how
mistaken
any
girl
is
who
thinks
she
can
accomplish
but
to
be
the
that
could
put
in
tune
some
really
splendid
instrument
ah
gay
appeal
was
subtle
and
strong
girl
would
be
glad
and
proud
to
be
the
inspiration
the
power
for
good
the
beckoning
hand
that
would
lead
a
man
to
the
noblest
heights
of
attainment
there
was
something
exhilarating
uplifting
in
the
thought
that
banished
sleep
night
often
brings
exalted
moods
that
seem
absurd
next
day
lying
there
looking
out
at
the
stars
the
pleasing
fancy
came
to
her
that
each
one
was
a
sacred
given
into
the
keeping
of
some
unseen
vestal
virgin
now
she
too
had
joined
this
sisterhood
and
had
lighted
a
vestal
fire
on
the
altar
of
a
promise
in
its
constant
watch
she
would
keep
tryst
with
all
that
life
demanded
of
her
chapter
iii
a
knight
comes
riding
next
morning
lloyd
found
that
her
exalted
mood
had
faded
away
with
the
stars
any
fire
must
pale
before
the
broad
light
of
day
and
her
fervour
had
given
place
to
a
very
lively
but
mundane
interest
in
the
brother
she
was
glad
to
hear
at
breakfast
that
he
liked
tennis
was
a
good
horseman
that
private
theatricals
were
always
a
success
when
he
had
a
hand
in
them
she
stored
away
in
her
memory
for
future
use
the
information
that
he
had
lived
several
years
in
spain
and
mexico
and
spoke
spanish
like
a
native
that
unlike
jameson
he
was
prouder
of
his
castilian
ancestors
than
his
english
ones
and
that
two
of
his
fads
were
collecting
pipes
and
rare
old
ivory
carvings
illustration
drew
rein
a
moment
at
the
gate
to
look
down
the
stately
avenue
the
more
she
heard
about
him
the
less
sure
she
felt
of
being
able
to
keep
her
promise
to
gay
it
began
to
seem
presumptuous
to
her
that
a
mere
should
imagine
that
she
could
exert
any
influence
over
such
an
accomplished
man
of
the
world
as
he
evidently
was
all
that
day
she
pictured
to
herself
at
intervals
how
she
should
meet
him
and
what
she
should
say
it
was
a
new
experience
for
the
haughty
princess
who
had
always
been
so
indifferent
to
the
opinions
of
her
boy
friends
gay
request
had
made
her
fortunately
she
had
a
glimpse
of
him
before
he
saw
her
which
helped
her
to
adjust
herself
to
the
rôle
she
wanted
to
assume
the
morning
after
his
arrival
in
the
valley
he
and
ranald
rode
past
the
locusts
and
drew
rein
a
moment
at
the
gate
to
look
down
the
stately
avenue
which
was
always
pointed
out
to
strangers
lloyd
watched
their
approach
from
behind
a
leafy
screen
of
lilac
bushes
the
gleam
of
a
wild
strawberry
had
lured
her
over
there
from
the
path
a
few
minutes
before
then
the
discovery
of
a
patch
of
clovers
near
by
had
tempted
her
to
a
seat
on
the
grass
she
was
arranging
the
long
stems
of
the
clovers
in
a
cluster
when
the
sound
of
made
her
look
up
so
thickset
were
the
lilacs
between
her
and
the
road
that
not
a
glimpse
of
her
white
dress
or
the
flutter
of
a
ribbon
betrayed
her
presence
and
they
paused
to
admire
the
avenue
unknowing
that
a
far
prettier
picture
was
hidden
away
a
few
yards
from
them
in
full
sound
of
their
voices
a
girl
half
lying
in
the
grass
with
june
own
fresh
charm
in
her
glowing
face
and
the
sunshine
throwing
dappled
leaf
shadows
over
her
soft
fair
hair
the
mischievous
light
in
her
hazel
eyes
deepened
as
she
watched
them
knights
come
riding
two
by
two
she
quoted
in
a
whisper
closely
scrutinizing
the
stranger
he
rides
well
anyhow
was
her
first
thought
the
next
was
that
he
looked
much
older
than
gay
description
had
led
her
to
imagine
probably
it
was
because
he
wore
a
moustache
while
rob
and
malcolm
and
alex
and
ranald
were
all
maybe
it
was
that
same
black
moustache
with
the
gleam
of
white
teeth
and
the
flashing
glance
of
his
black
eyes
that
gave
him
that
dashing
cavalier
sort
of
look
how
wonderfully
his
dark
face
lighted
up
when
he
smiled
and
how
distinctly
one
recalled
it
when
he
had
passed
on
and
yet
it
was
a
handsome
face
she
wondered
wherein
lay
its
charm
gay
words
recurred
to
her
so
fiery
and
impetuous
he
would
ride
over
anything
that
stood
in
his
way
to
get
what
he
wants
he
looks
it
she
thought
raising
her
head
a
trifle
to
watch
them
out
of
sight
i
afraid
i
ca
do
as
much
for
him
as
gay
expects
for
simply
not
stand
his
putting
on
any
of
his
lordly
ways
with
gathering
up
her
clovers
she
started
back
to
the
house
her
head
held
high
unconsciously
in
her
most
pose
some
one
else
had
watched
the
passing
of
the
two
young
men
on
horseback
from
his
arm
chair
on
the
white
pillared
porch
old
colonel
lloyd
reached
out
to
the
wicker
table
beside
him
for
his
to
focus
it
on
the
distant
entrance
gate
i
do
seem
to
place
them
he
said
aloud
it
looks
like
young
walton
on
the
roan
but
the
other
one
is
a
stranger
in
these
parts
then
as
he
saw
they
were
not
coming
in
he
shifted
the
glass
to
other
objects
slowly
his
gaze
swept
the
landscape
from
side
to
side
till
it
rested
on
lloyd
sitting
on
the
grass
by
the
lilac
thicket
sorting
her
lapful
of
clovers
something
in
her
childish
occupation
and
the
sunny
gleam
of
the
proud
little
head
bowed
intently
over
her
task
recalled
another
scene
to
the
old
colonel
that
morning
when
through
this
same
glass
he
had
watched
her
first
entrance
into
locust
was
it
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
ago
it
seemed
only
yesterday
that
he
had
found
her
near
that
same
spot
coolly
feeding
his
choicest
strawberries
to
an
elfish
looking
dog
time
had
gone
so
fast
since
his
imperious
little
had
come
into
his
life
to
fill
it
with
new
interests
and
deeper
meaning
yes
it
certainly
seemed
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
that
she
was
tyrannizing
over
him
in
her
adorable
baby
fashion
making
an
abject
slave
of
him
whom
every
one
else
feared
and
now
here
she
was
coming
towards
him
across
the
lawn
a
tall
fair
girl
in
the
last
summer
of
her
teens
why
amanthis
was
no
older
than
she
when
he
had
brought
her
home
to
locust
a
bride
and
no
doubt
some
one
would
be
coming
soon
wanting
to
carry
away
lloyd
the
light
of
his
eyes
and
the
life
of
the
place
it
made
him
angry
to
think
of
it
and
when
she
stopped
beside
his
chair
to
give
him
a
soft
pat
on
the
cheek
her
first
remark
sent
a
jealous
twinge
through
him
so
who
the
stranger
was
with
young
walton
he
responded
i
do
think
much
of
him
but
grandfathah
how
could
you
tell
at
such
a
distance
laughed
lloyd

is
fair
to
form
an
opinion

such
long
range

him
as
he

off

train
yestahday
evening
and
talked
him
into
consenting
i
glad
of
that
answered
the
old
colonel
heartily
work
and
no
play
makes
jack
a
dull
boy
this
last
year
has
been
hard
on
the
lad
the
judge
tells
me
he
never
left
the
place
a
single
night
since
his
daddy
died
he
just
grinds
along
in
that
hardware
store
all
day
and
is
into
his
law
books
as
soon
as
he
gets
home
he
getting
to
be
an
old
man
before
his
time
i
glad
your
little
friend
gay
is
here
this
summer
on
his
account
if
for
no
other
reason
she
draw
him
out
of
his
shell
if
anybody
can
i
remember
how
much
he
seemed
to
be
taken
with
her
that
christmas
vacation
she
spent
in
the
valley
lloyd
gaped
at
him
in
astonishment
why
grandfathah
i
nevah
dreamed
that
you
noticed
things
like
i
certainly
do
my
dear
he
answered
playfully
i
was
young
myself
once
upon
a
time
it
easy
to
recognize
familiar
landmarks
on
a
road
you
travelled
but
why
he
said
suddenly
in
a
changed
tone
if
i
may
be
so
bold
as
to
ask
is
this
young
texan
to
be
ushered
into
the
valley
with
this
blare
of
trumpets
and
torchlight
effect
is
he
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
no
but
it
will
make
him
feel
that
he
has
dropped
down
into
a
poky
inland
village
with
nothing
doing
but
into
a
lovely
social
whirl
instead
they
want
him
to
be
so
pleased
with
the
place
that
he
be
satisfied
to
stay
all
summah
it
was
almost
on
the
tip
of
her
tongue
to
tell
why
his
family
were
so
desirous
of
keeping
him
with
them
but
another
scornful
checked
her
for
some
unaccountable
reason
the
old
colonel
seemed
to
have
taken
a
dislike
to
this
stranger
and
she
knew
that
this
information
would
deepen
it
to
such
an
extent
that
he
would
not
want
her
to
have
anything
to
do
with
him
he
be
furious
if
he
knew
what
i
promised
gay
she
thought
for
he
takes
such
violent
prejudices
that
the
least
thing
fuel
to
the
flame
he
might
not
want
me
to
let
him
call
heah
or
anything
what
do
you
keep
saying
to
me
foh
she
asked
saucily
when
i
trying
to
tell
you
the
news
and
am
so
kind
and
polite
as
to
ask
you
to
go
to
the
pahty
with
us
it
dreadful
to
have
such
an
old
ogah
of
a
grandfathah
who
makes
you
shake
in
yoah
shoes
every
time
he
opens
his
mouth
her
arm
was
round
his
neck
as
she
spoke
and
her
cheek
pressed
against
his
the
caress
drove
away
every
other
thought
save
that
it
was
good
to
have
his
little
colonel
home
again
and
he
gave
a
pleased
chuckle
as
she
went
on
scolding
him
in
a
playful
manner
that
no
one
else
in
the
world
ever
dared
assume
with
him
but
all
the
while
that
she
was
twisting
his
white
moustache
and
braiding
his
goatee
into
a
funny
little
tail
she
was
thinking
about
the
evening
and
the
indifferent
air
with
which
she
intended
to
meet
leland
harcourt
she
would
have
to
be
indifferent
and
oblivious
of
his
existence
as
far
as
she
could
politely
because
gay
had
told
him
that
she
was
unapproachable
and
unattainable
she
would
talk
to
rob
most
of
the
evening
she
decided
she
was
glad
that
she
would
have
the
opportunity
for
she
had
not
seen
him
since
coming
home
he
had
called
at
the
locusts
the
night
after
her
return
from
school
but
that
was
the
night
she
had
stayed
at
the
cabin
with
gay
and
she
had
missed
him
did
you
know
that
your
trunks
came
while
you
were
at
the
asked
the
colonel
presently
owing
to
some
mistake
in
checking
their
baggage
in
washington
lloyd
trunks
had
been
delayed
and
she
had
been
wearing
some
of
betty
clothes
the
two
days
she
had
been
at
home
why
did
you
tell
me
soonah
she
asked
springing
up
from
her
seat
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
i
been
puzzling
my
brains
all
mawning
ovah
what
i
could
weah
tonight
hastily
gathering
up
the
handful
of
clovers
that
she
had
dropped
on
the
wicker
table
she
ran
upstairs
everything
in
her
pink
bower
of
a
room
was
in
confusion
her
commencement
gown
lay
on
the
bed
like
an
armful
of
thistledown
with
her
gloves
and
lace
fan
beside
it
on
the
mantel
stood
the
little
white
slippers
in
which
she
had
tripped
across
the
rostrum
at
warwick
hall
to
receive
her
diploma
from
madam
chartley
hands
now
the
diploma
with
its
imposing
red
seals
and
big
blue
satin
bow
was
reposing
on
top
of
the
clock
on
the
same
mantel
with
the
slippers
and
from
the
open
trunks
which
mom
beck
was
unpacking
a
motley
collection
of
books
clothing
sorority
banners
and
souvenirs
flowed
out
all
over
the
floor
the
old
coloured
woman
was
garrulous
this
morning
her
trip
to
washington
with
all
her
white
folks
to
her
baby
finishment
she
could
understand
why
it
should
be
called
commencement
had
been
the
event
of
her
life
and
when
she
could
get
no
one
else
to
listen
she
talked
to
herself
recounting
each
incident
of
her
journey
with
unctuous
enjoyment
she
was
on
her
knees
now
before
one
of
the
trunks
talking
so
earnestly
into
its
depths
that
lloyd
entering
the
room
looked
around
to
see
who
her
audience
could
be
at
the
sound
of
lloyd
step
the
monologue
came
to
a
sudden
stop
and
the
wrinkled
old
face
turned
with
a
smile
what
you
want
me
to
do
with
all
these
yeah
school
books
honey
now
you
done
with
fo
evah
mercy
mom

if

her
lovely
farewell
speech
to
the
graduating
class
what
the
good
of

commencement
if
that
all
the
impression
it
made
a
pleased
cackle
of
a
laugh

her
law
honey

could
listen
to
speeches
i
was
too
busy
thinkin
of
becky
potah
in
her
black
silk
dress
that
ole
give
me
for
the
grand
occasion
an
the
purple
pansies
in
my
bonnet
the
queen
o
sheby
could
held
a
to
me
day
she
was
off
on
another
chapter
of
reminiscences
now
but
lloyd
paid
no
attention
as
she
picked
up
the
books
and
found
places
for
them
on
the
low
shelves
that
filled
one
side
of
the
room
she
felt
as
if
she
were
assisting
at
the
last
sad
rites
of
something
very
dear
for
each
page
was
eloquent
with
happy
memories
of
her
last
year
at
school
every
scribbled
margin
recalled
some
pleasant
recitation
hour
and
most
of
the
were
decorated
by
kitty
ridiculous
caricatures
she
and
kitty
had
been
this
last
year
in
order
to
find
place
for
these
books
which
she
had
just
brought
home
she
had
to
carry
a
row
of
old
ones
down
to
the
library
they
were
juvenile
tales
most
of
them
which
she
laid
aside
girls
stories
that
had
once
been
a
never
failing
source
of
delight
she
could
remember
the
time
and
not
so
very
long
ago
either
when
it
had
seemed
impossible
that
she
could
them
and
now
as
she
trailed
down
stairs
with
an
armful
of
her
old
favourites
she
felt
as
if
the
shadowy
figure
of
her
childhood
the
little
lloyd
that
used
to
be
followed
her
with
reproachful
glances
for
her
disloyalty
to
these
discarded
friends
on
her
way
back
to
her
room
for
a
second
armful
she
stopped
outside
betty
door
for
a
moment
hoping
to
hear
some
noise
within
which
would
indicate
that
betty
was
not
at
her
desk
there
was
so
much
that
she
wanted
to
talk
to
her
about
one
of
the
things
she
had
looked
forward
to
most
eagerly
in
her
was
the
long
sisterly
talks
they
would
have
together
now
it
was
a
disappointment
to
find
her
so
absorbed
in
her
writing
that
she
was
as
inaccessible
as
if
she
had
withdrawn
into
a
cloister
i
be
glad
when
the
old
book
is
finished
thought
lloyd
impatiently
as
she
away
from
the
door
to
her
betty
ability
to
write
was
a
mysterious
and
wonderful
gift
not
for
anything
would
she
have
interrupted
her
when
genius
burned
but
she
resented
the
fact
that
it
should
rise
between
them
as
it
had
done
lately
even
when
betty
was
not
shut
up
in
her
room
actually
at
work
her
thoughts
seemed
to
be
on
it
she
was
living
in
a
world
of
her
own
creating
more
interested
in
the
characters
of
her
fancy
than
those
who
sat
at
table
with
her
since
beginning
the
last
chapter
she
had
been
so
preoccupied
and
that
lloyd
hardly
knew
her
she
was
so
unlike
the
old
betty
the
sympathetic
confidante
and
counsellor
who
had
been
interested
in
even
the
smallest
of
her
griefs
and
joys
if
lloyd
could
have
looked
on
the
other
side
of
the
closed
door
just
then
the
expression
on
betty
face
would
have
banished
every
feeling
of
impatience
or
resentment
and
sent
her
quietly
away
to
wait
and
wonder
while
betty
passed
through
one
of
the
great
hours
of
her
life
with
a
tense
earnest
face
bent
over
the
manuscript
she
reached
the
climax
of
her
story
the
last
page
the
last
paragraph
then
with
a
throbbing
heart
she
halted
a
moment
pen
in
hand
before
adding
the
words
she
wrote
them
slowly
reverently
almost
and
then
realizing
that
the
ambition
of
her
life
had
been
accomplished
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
awe
in
her
brown
eyes
it
was
done
at
last
the
work
that
she
had
pledged
herself
to
do
so
long
ago
back
there
in
the
little
old
wooden
church
at
the
cuckoo
nest
for
a
time
she
forgot
the
luxurious
room
where
she
sat
and
was
back
at
the
beginning
of
her
ambition
and
high
resolves
in
that
plain
old
meeting
house
in
the
grove
of
cedars
again
she
tiptoed
down
the
empty
aisle
that
was
as
still
as
a
tomb
save
for
the
buzzing
of
a
wasp
at
the
open
window
through
which
she
had
climbed
again
she
opened
the
little
red
above
the
back
pew
that
held
the
remnants
of
a
scattered
library
the
queer
musty
smell
of
the
volumes
floated
out
to
her
as
strong
as
ever
mingling
with
the
warm
spicy
scent
of
pinks
and
cedar
from
the
graveyard
just
outside
the
open
window
those
tattered
books
read
in
secret
to
davy
on
sunny
summer
afternoons
had
been
the
first
voices
to
whisper
to
her
that
she
too
was
destined
to
leave
a
record
behind
her
and
now
that
she
had
done
it
they
seemed
to
call
her
back
to
that
starting
place
sitting
there
in
happy
reverie
she
wished
that
she
could
make
a
pilgrimage
back
to
the
little
church
she
would
like
to
slip
down
its
narrow
aisle
just
when
the
afternoon
sun
was
shining
yellowest
on
its
worn
benches
and
old
altar
and
dropping
on
her
knees
as
she
had
done
years
ago
in
a
transport
of
gratitude
whisper
a
happy
thank
you
god
from
the
depths
of
a
glad
little
heart
presently
the
whisper
did
go
up
from
her
desk
where
she
sat
with
her
face
in
her
hands
then
reaching
out
for
the
last
volume
of
the
white
and
gold
series
that
chronicled
her
good
times
she
opened
it
to
where
a
blotter
kept
the
place
at
a
half
written
page
and
added
this
entry
june
truly
a
day
for
hereon
endeth
my
story
of
the
book
is
written
at
last
two
chapters
are
still
to
be
copied
on
the
typewriter
but
the
itself
is
woven
and
ready
to
be
cut
from
the
loom
i
am
glad
now
that
i
waited
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
publish
anything
in
my
teens
the
world
looks
very
different
to
me
now
at
twenty
i
have
outgrown
my
early
opinions
and
ideals
with
my
short
dresses
just
as
walton
said
we
would
now
the
critics
can
say
waitedst
till
thy
woman
fingers
wrought
the
best
that
lay
within
thy
woman
heart
i
can
say
honestly
i
have
put
the
very
best
of
me
into
it
and
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
that
i
have
accomplished
the
one
great
thing
i
started
out
to
do
so
many
years
ago
gives
me
more
happiness
i
am
sure
than
any
leaf
that
any
prince
could
bring
such
elation
as
was
betty
that
hour
seldom
comes
to
one
more
than
once
in
a
years
afterward
her
busy
pen
produced
far
worthier
books
which
were
beloved
and
bethumbed
in
thousands
of
libraries
but
none
of
them
ever
brought
again
that
keen
inward
thrill
that
wave
of
intense
happiness
which
surged
through
her
warm
and
sweet
as
she
sat
looking
down
on
that
first
completed
manuscript
she
was
loath
to
lay
it
aside
for
the
joy
of
the
creator
possessed
her
and
in
the
first
flush
of
pleased
surveyal
of
her
handiwork
she
humbly
called
it
good
she
went
down
to
lunch
in
such
an
uplifted
frame
of
mind
that
she
seemed
to
be
walking
on
air
but
betty
was
always
quiet
even
in
her
most
intense
moments
save
for
the
brilliant
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
the
unusual
light
in
her
eyes
there
was
no
sign
of
her
inward
excitement
she
slipped
into
her
seat
at
table
with
the
careless
announcement
well
it
finished
it
was
lloyd
who
made
all
the
demonstration
amid
the
family
congratulations
waving
her
napkin
with
one
hand
and
clicking
two
spoons
together
like
castanets
she
sprang
from
her
chair
and
rushed
around
the
table
to
give
vent
to
her
pleasure
by
throwing
her
arms
around
betty
in
a
delighted
embrace
oh
you
little
mouse
she
cried
how
can
you
sit
there
taking
it
so
calmly
if
i
had
done
such
an
amazing
thing
as
to
write
a
book
i
have
slidden
down
the
with
a
whoop
to
announce
it
and
come
walking
in
on
my
hands
instead
of
my
feet
of
i
just
as
proud
of
it
as
the
rest
of
the
family
are
she
added
when
she
had
expended
her
enthusiasm
and
gone
back
to
her
seat
but
now
that
it
done
i
confess
that
i
been
jealous
of
that
old
book
evah
since
i
came
home
and
i
mighty
glad
it
out
of
the
way
now
you
have
time
to
take
some
interest
in
what
the
rest
of
us
are
doing
and
you
feel
free
to
go
in
for
the
celebration
at
the
cabin
tonight
all
the
rest
of
that
day
seemed
a
fête
day
to
betty
her
inward
glow
lent
a
zest
to
the
doing
of
even
the
most
trivial
things
and
she
prepared
for
the
gaieties
at
the
cabin
as
if
it
were
her
own
entertainment
pleased
that
this
occasion
of
her
life
should
be
marked
by
some
kind
of
a
celebration
it
was
to
do
honour
to
the
day
and
not
to
the
harcourt
guest
that
she
arrayed
herself
in
her
most
becoming
gown
rob
dropped
in
early
quite
in
the
old
way
as
if
there
had
never
been
a
cessation
of
his
daily
visits
announcing
that
he
had
come
to
escort
the
girls
to
the
cabin
lloyd
who
was
not
quite
ready
leaned
over
the
banister
in
the
upper
hall
for
a
glimpse
of
her
old
playmate
intending
to
call
down
some
word
of
greeting
but
he
looked
so
grave
and
dignified
as
he
came
forward
under
the
hall
chandelier
to
shake
hands
with
betty
that
she
drew
back
in
silence
the
next
instant
she
resented
this
new
feeling
of
reserve
that
seemed
to
rise
up
and
wipe
out
all
their
years
of
early
comradery
why
she
call
down
to
him
over
the
banister
as
she
had
always
done
she
asked
herself
defiantly
he
was
still
the
same
old
rob
even
if
he
had
grown
stern
and
grave
looking
she
leaned
over
again
but
this
time
it
was
the
sight
of
betty
that
stopped
her
she
had
never
seen
her
so
beaming
so
positively
radiant
in
that
filmy
yellow
dress
she
might
have
posed
as
the
daffodil
maid
her
cheeks
were
still
flushed
her
velvety
brown
eyes
luminous
with
the
joy
of
the
day
achievement
lloyd
watched
her
a
moment
in
fascinated
admiration
as
she
stood
laughing
and
talking
under
the
hall
light
then
she
saw
that
rob
was
just
as
much
impressed
with
betty
attractiveness
as
she
was
and
was
looking
at
her
as
if
he
had
made
a
discovery
his
pleased
glance
and
the
frank
compliment
that
followed
sent
a
thought
into
lloyd
mind
that
made
her
wonder
why
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
how
well
betty
would
fit
into
the
establishment
over
at
oaklea
what
a
dear
daughter
she
would
make
to
moore
and
what
a
joy
she
would
be
to
the
old
judge
rob
seemed
to
be
finding
her
immensely
entertaining
well
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
hurry
down
now
she
could
take
her
time
about
changing
her
dress
lloyd
could
not
have
told
what
had
made
her
decide
so
suddenly
that
her
dress
needed
changing
she
had
put
on
a
pale
green
dimity
that
she
liked
because
it
was
simple
and
but
now
after
a
glance
into
the
mirror
she
began
to
slip
it
off
it
looks
like
a
wilted
lettuce
leaf
she
said
petulantly
to
her
reflection
realizing
that
nothing
but
white
could
hold
its
own
when
brought
in
contact
with
betty
gown
that
pale
exquisite
shade
of
glowing
yellow
would
be
the
dominating
colour
in
any
place
it
might
be
worn
i
must
live
up
to
gay
expectations
she
thought
so
white
it
shall
be
señor
harcourt
his
dark
face
with
its
flashing
smile
rose
before
her
and
stayed
in
the
foreground
of
her
thoughts
all
the
time
she
was
arraying
herself
in
her
daintiest
fluffiest
white
organdy
clasping
the
little
necklace
of
roman
pearls
around
her
throat
and
catching
up
her
lace
fan
she
swept
up
to
the
mirror
for
a
last
anxious
survey
it
was
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
one
and
with
a
final
smoothing
of
ribbons
she
smiled
over
her
shoulder
at
the
charming
reflection
now
i
go
down
and
practise
my
airs
and
graces
on
rob
and
betty
for
awhile
but
i
leave
them
in
peace
after
we
get
to
the
cabin
for
if
there
should
be
any
possibility
of
their
beginning
to
care
for
each
othah
i
would
get
in
the
way
for
worlds
now
is
the
way
sail
in
to
meet
mistah
harcourt
thus
it
happened
that
the
hauteur
with
which
she
intended
to
impress
him
was
in
her
manner
when
she
swept
in
to
greet
rob
it
was
not
meant
for
rob
but
it
had
the
same
effect
as
if
it
were
making
him
feel
as
if
she
wished
to
drop
the
friendly
familiarity
of
their
school
days
and
meet
him
on
the
footing
of
a
recent
acquaintance
he
had
been
looking
forward
all
year
to
her
and
now
it
gave
him
a
vague
sense
of
disappointment
and
injury
that
she
should
be
as
conventionally
gracious
to
him
as
if
he
were
the
veriest
stranger
his
eyes
followed
her
wistfully
as
if
looking
for
something
very
precious
which
he
had
lost
wholly
unconscious
of
the
way
she
was
spoiling
the
evening
for
him
lloyd
went
on
playing
the
part
of
serene
highness
laid
out
for
her
never
to
gay
admiring
eyes
had
she
seemed
more
beautiful
more
the
fair
unattainable
princess
than
she
was
in
her
meeting
with
leland
harcourt
gay
wanted
to
pat
her
on
the
back
for
she
saw
that
she
had
made
the
very
impression
expected
of
her
long
practice
had
made
gay
quick
in
interpreting
leland
slightest
change
of
expression
and
she
was
well
pleased
now
with
what
she
read
in
his
face
but
to
lloyd
the
dark
smiling
eyes
regarding
everything
with
a
slightly
amused
expression
showed
nothing
more
than
the
superficial
interest
which
ordinary
politeness
demanded
of
him
he
made
some
pretty
speech
about
the
valley
and
his
pleasure
in
meeting
its
charming
people
and
then
stood
talking
only
long
enough
to
make
her
feel
that
gay
was
right
in
her
estimate
of
him
he
was
entertaining
even
fascinating
in
his
manner
more
entertaining
than
any
man
she
had
ever
met
but
just
as
she
reached
this
conclusion
she
found
herself
handed
over
in
some
unaccountable
way
to
some
one
else
and
that
was
the
last
of
his
attention
to
her
that
night
he
seemed
immensely
entertained
by
kitty
and
much
interested
in
betty
and
the
fact
that
she
had
finished
writing
a
book
that
very
day
gay
heralded
her
advent
with
that
news
lloyd
could
overhear
little
scraps
of
conversation
that
made
her
long
to
have
a
share
in
it
his
repartee
was
positively
brilliant
she
found
herself
thinking
the
kind
that
one
reads
of
in
books
but
never
hears
elsewhere
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
lloyd
felt
herself
calmly
and
deliberately
ignored
just
as
she
had
planned
to
ignore
him
maybe
it
because
gay
told
him
that
i
would
be
so
indifferent
she
thought
and
he
does
think
it
worth
the
effort
to
put
himself
out
to
make
me
be
nice
to
him
i
do
care
nevertheless
a
little
feeling
of
disappointment
and
pique
crept
in
to
spoil
her
evening
also
for
in
the
limited
wisdom
of
her
experiences
she
did
not
recognize
that
this
young
man
was
ignoring
her
because
he
was
interested
that
he
had
only
adopted
her
own
tactics
as
the
surest
way
of
gaining
his
end
chapter
iv
betty
novel
it
was
gay
voice
over
the
telephone
oh
lloyd
you
come
do
arrange
it
some
way
lucy
is
frightened
stiff
at
the
thought
of
being
left
here
alone
all
night
with
just
me
and
she
thought
it
would
be
such
a
good
time
for
betty
to
read
us
her
novel
as
she
promised
before
she
sends
it
away
to
the
publishers
there
be
no
callers
to
interrupt
us
on
such
a
rainy
day
hold
the
phone
a
minute
answered
lloyd
i
see
it
gay
she
explained
to
her
mother
who
had
come
out
into
the
hall
at
the
first
tinkle
of
the
bell
thinking
the
summons
might
be
for
her
mistah
harcourt
and
his
brothah
went
to
lexington
this
mawning
to
buy
those
hawses
and
gay
and
lucy
are
afraid
to
stay
there
tonight
the
cook
had
promised
to
sleep
at
the
house
but
something
turned
up
at
her
home
a
little
while
ago
to
prevent
so
they
want
kitty
and
betty
and
me
to
come
ovah
right
away
and
spend
the
aftahnoon
and
night
it
raining
cataracts
and
i
know
you
do
like
to
take
the
new
carriage
out
in
such
weathah
but
could
alec
put
the
curtains
on
the
old
one
sherman
glanced
dubiously
towards
the
windows
against
which
the
rain
was
beating
in
torrents
and
leave
me
all
alone
when
i
been
looking
forward
to
this
same
good
rainy
afternoon
with
you
almost
slipped
from
tongue
but
the
eager
desire
shining
in
the
faces
of
both
girls
kept
back
the
words
it
only
a
warm
summer
rain
interposed
betty
seeing
her
hesitate
very
well
then
consented
sherman
with
a
smile
but
as
she
went
back
to
her
room
she
stifled
a
little
sigh
of
disappointment
i
suppose
it
only
natural
they
should
want
to
be
going
she
thought
but
if
it
was
so
selfish
i
could
almost
wish
that
gay
had
come
to
the
valley
for
the
summer
she
will
take
lloyd
away
from
home
so
often
and
i
have
looked
forward
so
long
to
the
companion
she
would
be
when
her
school
days
were
ended
wholly
unconscious
of
her
mother
disappointment
lloyd
was
answering
merrily
we
be
ovah
right
away
ring
up
kitty
again
and
tell
her
we
drive
by
for
her
an
hour
later
the
five
girls
for
the
bride
of
a
year
seemed
the
youngest
of
them
all
at
times
were
seated
in
an
upstairs
room
at
the
lindsey
cabin
each
in
a
comfortable
rocking
chair
lucy
had
taken
them
to
her
room
saying
it
was
cozier
up
near
the
roof
where
they
could
hear
the
rain
patter
on
the
shingles
also
her
dormer
windows
faced
the
west
and
they
would
have
daylight
longer
there
it
took
a
little
while
for
them
to
get
settled
for
the
reading
lucy
brought
out
the
family
darning
with
a
matronly
air
when
she
saw
that
lloyd
had
brought
a
square
of
linen
to
start
a
piece
of
and
kitty
had
some
napkins
to
hem
walton
had
turned
over
the
management
of
the
house
to
kitty
only
that
day
allison
had
had
it
the
year
before
and
with
zeal
she
had
begun
with
an
exploration
of
the
linen
closet
where
she
had
found
a
pile
of
unhemmed
linen
not
wanting
to
be
idle
while
all
the
rest
were
occupied
gay
kept
them
waiting
while
she
burrowed
through
her
trunk
for
an
intricate
piece
of
knitting
work
which
she
had
begun
two
years
before
it
had
been
intended
for
a
christmas
present
and
she
had
brought
it
with
her
intending
to
finish
it
before
another
christmas
or
perish
in
the
attempt
do
pay
any
attention
to
me
she
warned
there
be
places
where
i
have
to
stop
and
count
stitches
and
fairly
wrestle
with
it
but
i
be
listening
in
spite
of
my
bodily
contortions
they
were
all
ready
at
last
so
betty
picked
up
the
first
chapter
and
cleared
her
throat
she
had
been
anxious
to
read
her
novel
to
the
girls
she
had
been
so
sure
of
its
merit
but
now
as
she
glanced
down
the
page
she
was
assailed
by
misgivings
after
all
she
might
not
have
been
an
impartial
judge
and
maybe
it
was
as
good
as
it
seemed
to
her
you
recognize
some
of
the
incidents
she
explained
and
one
character
is
a
composite
portrait
of
three
lloydsboro
people
he
looks
like
jaynes
stutters
like
captain
bedel
and
has
experiences
that
once
happened
to
doctor
shelby
i
put
miss
marietta
waring
romance
into
it
too
betty
read
well
she
loved
the
characters
she
had
fashioned
and
with
her
sympathetic
voice
to
interpret
them
they
became
almost
as
real
to
her
listeners
as
they
were
to
herself
presently
the
girls
began
to
exchange
approving
nods
she
watched
them
from
the
corner
of
her
eye
now
and
then
there
were
low
murmurs
of
approbation
at
some
particularly
pleasing
incident
or
turn
of
expression
and
at
the
end
of
the
first
chapter
there
was
outspoken
applause
they
complimented
enthusiastically
while
betty
rested
and
took
breath
for
the
next
as
she
felt
the
genuine
pleasure
she
was
affording
them
all
her
fears
as
to
its
fled
she
began
to
see
that
her
story
was
even
better
than
she
had
thought
it
she
saw
it
in
better
perspective
through
their
eyes
its
plot
moved
so
smoothly
there
was
more
life
more
in
it
than
she
had
been
conscious
of
in
her
solitary
readings
it
was
certainly
worth
all
the
painstaking
effort
it
had
cost
her
she
could
look
at
it
now
and
no
longer
humbly
but
confidently
call
it
good
when
in
one
scene
she
stole
a
furtive
glance
around
to
note
the
effect
and
caught
lucy
stealthily
slipping
out
her
handkerchief
gay
looking
up
with
tears
on
her
lashes
and
lloyd
with
the
peculiar
tightening
of
the
lips
that
showed
she
was
trying
to
swallow
the
lump
in
her
throat
she
was
so
happy
she
could
have
sung
for
joy
she
read
on
and
on
and
they
forgot
the
rain
beating
against
the
windows
forgot
everything
but
their
interest
in
the
story
lucy
pushed
her
darning
basket
aside
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
the
work
over
which
lloyd
had
been
bending
dropped
in
her
lap
and
her
little
gold
thimble
rolled
away
into
a
corner
unheeded
there
was
a
personal
interest
in
the
story
for
each
of
them
lloyd
saw
herself
as
plainly
in
betty
heroine
as
she
could
see
her
reflection
in
the
mirror
door
of
the
huge
mahogany
wardrobe
opposite
her
some
of
kitty
ridiculous
speeches
that
had
become
historical
in
her
family
found
a
place
here
and
there
and
once
lucy
laughed
outright
exclaiming
why
that
just
like
gay
you
must
have
been
thinking
of
her
when
you
wrote
it
the
reading
went
on
without
interruption
until
it
was
so
dark
that
betty
had
to
hold
her
manuscript
close
to
the
window
i
ring
for
lights
thought
lucy
just
as
soon
as
she
comes
to
the
end
of
this
chapter
but
with
the
end
of
the
chapter
came
allison
with
a
message
from
the
kitchen
lucy
started
up
in
dismay
there
i
forgot
all
about
that
salad
how
could
i
be
so
careless
when
i
to
have
a
real
live
authoress
to
dinner
i
was
so
interested
i
had
a
thought
for
anything
but
the
story
such
appreciation
is
a
thousand
times
better
than
salad
laughed
betty
so
jubilant
over
her
triumph
that
her
eyes
were
full
of
a
happy
light
this
is
a
good
place
to
stop
until
after
dinner
i
read
until
my
throat
is
tired
lucy
hurried
down
stairs
to
hasten
the
dinner
preparations
in
order
that
they
might
get
back
to
the
reading
as
soon
as
possible
the
four
girls
folded
their
work
and
sat
in
the
twilight
talking
what
does
this
make
you
think
of
asked
lloyd
i
know
what
in
your
mind
answered
kitty
i
was
just
about
to
speak
of
it
myself
that
rainy
day
at
boarding
school
when
ida
shane
read
fortune
of
daisy
dale
to
us
behind
locked
doors
was
it
thrilling
gay
who
had
heard
the
incident
mentioned
many
times
at
warwick
hall
said
plaintively
you
girls
always
make
me
feel
that
i
have
missed
half
my
life
because
i
was
with
you
when
ida
shane
read
that
story
certainly
like
to
get
my
hands
on
such
a
wonderful
piece
of
literature
but
it
was
wonderful
betty
hastened
to
explain
it
made
that
deep
impression
on
us
simply
because
it
was
the
first
novel
we
had
ever
read
it
was
sentimental
and
melodramatic
and
trashy
as
we
since
discovered
but
then
it
seemed
all
that
was
lovely
and
romantic
it
gave
us
thrills
up
and
down
our
spines
and
sent
us
around
with
our
heads
in
the
clouds
for
days
we
were
seeing
embryo
guy
wolverings
in
every
boy
we
met
as
i
listened
to
ida
i
thought
that
if
i
could
only
write
a
book
that
would
hold
my
listeners
spellbound
as
that
held
us
i
ask
no
more
of
life
i
could
die
happy
well
you
done
it
dear
said
gay
warmly
we
scarcely
breathed
during
the
last
two
chapters
and
i
so
eager
to
know
how
it
ends
that
i
willingly
cut
dinner
to
go
on
with
it
now
how
does
that
make
you
feel
miss
elizabeth
lloyd
lewis
asked
kitty
teasingly
fair
uplifted
i
nae
doot
yes
it
does
was
the
honest
answer
it
what
i
hoped
for
and
worked
for
and
prayed
for
these
last
ten
years
can
you
wonder
that
it
makes
me
radiantly
happy
to
have
you
girls
think
that
i
have
in
a
measure
succeeded
dinner
was
announced
a
little
later
and
when
the
girls
went
into
the
they
found
lucy
herself
bringing
it
in
poor
sylvia
had
another
message
from
home
she
explained
so
i
told
her
and
allison
to
go
on
that
we
wait
on
ourselves
and
clear
the
table
and
they
could
wash
the
dishes
in
the
morning
it
not
raining
quite
so
hard
now
but
it
is
dark
as
a
pocket
outside
as
she
placed
the
soup
tureen
on
the
table
they
heard
the
outer
kitchen
door
close
and
sylvia
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
ugh
exclaimed
lucy
with
a
shiver
now
we
abandoned
to
our
fate
i
wish
you
pull
that
farther
down
gay
there
just
room
for
somebody
to
peep
under
it
and
there
nothing
more
terrifying
to
me
than
the
thought
of
eyes
peering
in
at
one
from
the
outer
darkness
gobelins
will
git
you
if
you
do
watch
out
sang
gay
do
for
pity
sake
put
your
mind
on
something
else
lucy
and
do
spoil
this
festive
occasion
with
a
case
of
high
jinks
seeing
that
their
little
hostess
was
really
nervous
and
timid
kitty
began
to
divert
them
all
by
impersonating
different
characters
in
the
valley
she
was
a
fine
mimic
and
kept
them
laughing
all
through
the
first
course
lucy
carried
out
the
plates
and
hurried
back
with
the
second
course
you
got
to
get
the
salad
when
the
time
comes
she
said
to
gay
it
so
spooky
out
there
in
the
kitchen
with
sylvia
gone
that
i
was
afraid
to
look
over
my
shoulder
queer
is
it
for
it
just
as
warm
and
and
cheerful
now
as
when
she
was
there
i
would
go
into
the
pantry
alone
for
a
fortune
nonsense
cried
kitty
five
valiant
females
are
enough
to
keep
any
lloydsboro
foe
at
bay
we
be
your
brave
defenders
gay
who
had
risen
to
circle
around
the
table
with
a
plate
of
hot
biscuit
paused
dramatically
beside
lucy
chair
to
say
in
a
stage
whisper
hist
i
have
a
weapon
of
defence
ye
wot
not
of
one
that
a
doughty
knight
did
leave
behind
him
oh
said
the
literal
lucy
i
suppose
you
mean
that
he
left
on
the
piano
when
he
came
in
yesterday
to
bring
you
those
books
it
was
awfully
funny
girls
the
way
he
to
leave
it
by
accident
i
could
help
laughing
for
it
was
so
evident
he
did
it
on
purpose
to
have
an
excuse
to
come
again
sooner
than
he
would
have
done
otherwise
gay
smiled
knowingly
it
was
not
a
she
meant
but
for
reasons
of
her
own
she
did
not
enlighten
lucy
as
to
the
kind
of
weapon
she
had
in
reserve
it
was
after
eight
when
they
rose
from
the
table
and
they
made
such
a
frolic
of
carrying
out
the
dishes
that
the
grandfather
clock
on
the
stairs
chimed
the
as
they
finished
before
allison
left
she
had
started
a
cheerful
blaze
in
the
fireplace
of
the
huge
living
room
for
the
night
was
chilly
as
well
as
damp
but
lucy
partly
covered
it
with
ashes
and
proposed
spending
the
evening
somehow
one
feels
so
much
safer
when
there
are
no
men
in
the
house
she
explained
we
light
two
big
lamps
and
that
will
make
it
as
warm
and
cosy
as
if
we
had
a
fire
so
in
a
body
they
made
the
rounds
of
the
rooms
bolting
windows
and
locking
doors
then
satisfied
that
every
entrance
was
securely
fastened
they
went
to
resume
the
reading
this
time
there
was
no
attempt
to
do
any
needlework
with
folded
hands
they
waited
in
expectant
silence
while
betty
found
her
place
but
just
as
she
raised
the
sheet
of
paper
the
great
door
of
the
mahogany
wardrobe
swung
slowly
and
stealthily
open
not
a
sound
did
it
make
and
there
was
something
so
ghostly
in
its
silent
undoing
that
lucy
gave
a
little
shriek
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
each
one
of
them
acknowledged
to
a
queer
chilly
sensation
just
for
an
instant
even
gay
who
explained
that
it
was
only
a
little
habit
that
the
wardrobe
had
i
do
mind
it
in
the
she
added
but
it
spooky
at
night
when
everything
is
still
to
have
it
unexpectedly
pop
open
and
swing
out
with
that
slow
gliding
motion
it
because
the
latch
is
worn
and
the
catch
works
loose
said
kitty
who
had
crossed
the
room
to
examine
it
she
turned
the
key
now
it
will
not
interrupt
us
for
awhile
go
on
with
the
story
betty
again
the
manuscript
was
raised
and
again
lucy
stopped
her
with
the
wail
oh
gay
we
forgotten
to
bring
up
the
silver
pitcher
and
jameson
ladle
i
put
them
on
the
table
after
i
washed
them
and
then
marched
off
and
forgot
them
well
i
go
down
for
them
volunteered
gay
there
no
use
in
your
doing
it
and
getting
another
fit
of
shivers
the
other
three
sprang
up
but
gay
waved
betty
back
save
your
breath
for
the
reading
kitty
and
lloyd
will
be
enough
i
do
mind
acknowledging
that
i
be
glad
to
have
both
a
rear
and
a
vanguard
going
through
that
dark
hall
lighting
a
candle
and
holding
it
high
above
her
head
lloyd
led
the
way
gay
was
inwardly
quaking
for
she
was
almost
as
timid
as
her
sister
but
the
fearlessness
of
her
two
companions
made
her
keep
up
a
pretence
of
bravery
as
the
three
pairs
of
little
heels
clattered
down
the
dark
polished
steps
lloyd
and
kitty
kept
time
in
a
singsong
chant
there
was
a
man
and
he
had
naught
and
robbers
came
to
rob
him
he
got
up
on
the
chimney
top
and
then
they
thought
they
had
him
but
he
got
down
on
the
other
side
and
then
they
could
find
him
he
went
miles
in
fifteen
and
never
looked
behind
him
it
was
almost
cruel
of
kitty
to
seize
that
opportunity
to
tell
the
scariest
burglar
tale
that
she
had
ever
heard
but
a
fine
appreciation
of
dramatic
situations
urged
her
to
it
ugh
do
begged
gay
as
they
filed
into
the
and
began
looking
around
for
the
silver
heirlooms
lucy
was
mistaken
it
was
the
kitchen
table
on
which
she
had
left
them
the
is
standing
out
all
over
me
that
the
most
gruesome
tale
i
ever
heard
but
i
in
the
most
interesting
part
insisted
kitty
when
she
saw
the
black
face
leering
over
the
transom
hush
chattered
gay
i
wo
listen
to
another
word
it
so
creepy
i
can
feel
things
grabbing
at
my
ankles
let
me
have
the
candle
a
minute
please
lloyd
i
want
to
get
something
out
of
the
drawer
there
was
a
faint
glow
on
the
hearth
from
the
few
embers
lucy
had
left
uncovered
and
the
two
stood
within
it
as
they
waited
for
gay
to
come
back
with
the
candle
kitty
went
on
with
her
tale
for
lloyd
was
as
fearless
as
herself
she
did
not
get
further
than
a
sentence
or
two
however
before
gay
came
hurrying
back
to
their
astonishment
she
blew
out
the
candle
as
she
reached
them
and
in
the
brief
glimpse
they
had
of
her
face
they
saw
that
it
was
ghastly
white
in
the
dim
glow
of
the
embers
they
were
scarcely
visible
to
each
other
she
clutched
them
with
trembling
fingers
there
some
one
prowling
around
the
house
she
whispered
some
one
was
creeping
around
under
the
windows
and
then
up
on
the
porch
i
heard
them
plain
as
day
i
blew
out
the
light
so
they
could
see
in
pooh
began
lloyd
but
enough
of
gay
excitement
had
been
communicated
to
both
her
listeners
to
make
their
hearts
thump
a
little
faster
when
they
too
heard
a
noise
at
the
window
there
certainly
were
steps
on
the
porch
then
the
knocker
on
the
front
door
was
lifted
and
a
hollow
clang
echoed
through
the
hall
burglars
do
knock
said
lloyd
with
a
sigh
of
relief
let
all
go
to
the
doah
togethah
and
ask
who
there
we
need
open
it
no
do
begged
gay
almost
in
tears
it
just
like
that
awful
story
kitty
started
to
tell
the
knock
at
the
door
the
lone
voice
answering
and
the
burglar
forcing
his
way
over
the
transom
our
only
safety
is
in
keeping
perfectly
still
if
worst
comes
to
worst
i
make
them
think
there
a
man
in
the
house
but
i
wo
do
it
till
i
driven
to
it
if
it
one
of
the
neighbours
he
knock
again
said
kitty
for
a
moment
they
waited
their
hearts
in
their
mouths
as
they
remembered
what
a
lonely
place
was
this
dark
beech
woods
and
how
near
it
was
to
stumptown
with
its
many
drunken
negroes
the
knock
was
not
repeated
but
the
steps
sounded
as
if
the
intruder
were
prowling
back
and
forth
on
the
porch
then
the
slats
of
the
turned
stealthily
thank
heaven
the
shades
are
down
chattered
gay
hysterically
oh
girls
i
growing
i
ca
stand
this
suspense
another
second
then
as
the
steps
once
more
crossed
the
porch
cut
quick
both
of
you
i
follow
she
darted
out
of
the
dim
circle
of
light
on
the
hearth
and
they
could
not
see
what
happened
but
almost
instantly
a
pistol
shot
rang
out
up
till
that
moment
neither
kitty
nor
lloyd
had
been
much
alarmed
now
they
clutched
each
other
wildly
it
some
crazy
man
escaped
from
the
lakeland
asylum
began
kitty
but
her
words
were
cut
short
by
another
shot
then
another
and
another
and
another
in
such
rapid
succession
that
they
lost
count
a
series
of
piercing
screams
from
lucy
made
their
blood
run
cold
but
the
shrieks
were
not
half
as
terrifying
as
the
sight
of
gay
staggering
back
out
of
the
hall
as
they
sprang
towards
her
she
leaned
against
them
limply
is
she
shot
gasped
kitty
in
a
horrified
whisper
oh
the
light
with
shaking
hands
lloyd
caught
up
the
daily
paper
left
lying
on
the
settle
and
threw
it
on
the
coals
it
blazed
up
instantly
and
by
its
light
she
found
the
candle
the
shrieks
were
still
going
on
and
betty
was
calling
out
frantically
to
know
what
was
the
matter
she
could
not
come
down
to
see
for
herself
for
lucy
had
caught
her
in
a
hysterical
grasp
and
was
holding
her
like
a
vise
as
the
candle
flared
up
something
fell
from
gay
nerveless
hand
to
the
floor
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
astonishment
it
was
a
revolver
gay
herself
had
fired
the
shots
now
in
the
midst
of
their
bewilderment
they
became
conscious
of
shouts
outside
some
one
was
calling
harcourt
miss
melville
do
be
alarmed
it
only
alex
shelby
recognizing
the
voice
lloyd
flew
to
open
the
door
candle
in
hand
oh
you
gave
us
such
a
scare
she
began
in
a
tone
of
relief
we
thought
it
was
a
burglar
doing
the
shooting
we
nevah
dreamed
that
had
a
revolvah
it
was
mine
explained
alex
laughing
so
that
he
could
hardly
close
his
umbrella
i
loaded
it
for
her
and
loaned
it
to
her
yesterday
but
i
had
no
idea
it
would
come
back
at
me
in
that
boomerang
fashion
she
popped
loose
and
shot
at
me
bang
through
the
front
door
the
first
shot
whistled
just
over
my
head
and
if
i
had
dodged
behind
a
post
i
surely
would
have
stopped
them
all
hottest
welcome
i
ever
had
then
as
he
came
on
in
he
continued
apologetically
i
mighty
sorry
i
gave
you
all
such
a
fright
i
ought
to
have
gone
away
without
knocking
when
i
saw
there
was
no
light
but
i
knew
you
were
all
here
and
it
was
so
early
i
never
dreamed
of
being
taken
for
a
burglar
he
kept
on
with
his
apologies
after
he
came
into
the
hall
but
gay
was
not
there
to
hear
mortified
that
she
had
been
so
rash
and
horrified
by
the
thought
of
how
serious
the
consequences
of
her
wild
shooting
might
have
been
she
could
not
face
him
at
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
she
ran
for
the
stairs
her
wild
dash
almost
upsetting
lucy
and
betty
on
their
way
down
when
repeated
callings
failed
to
bring
her
back
kitty
went
up
to
look
for
her
and
found
her
in
a
woebegone
heap
on
the
foot
of
her
bed
oh
you
must
take
it
to
heart
that
way
she
said
soothingly
in
response
to
gay
tearful
protests
that
she
could
never
look
him
in
the
face
again
never
that
he
always
think
what
a
fool
she
was
and
how
near
she
came
to
killing
him
nonsense
was
kitty
brisk
answer
he
insists
that
it
is
all
his
own
fault
that
he
ought
to
have
known
what
to
expect
when
he
called
on
a
native
texan
he
says
he
always
heard
that
they
punctuate
their
remarks
with
bullets
and
will
shoot
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
hereafter
he
will
herald
his
approach
by
telephone
or
else
come
in
a
coat
of
mail
warranted
to
turn
even
the
fire
of
a
gatling
gun
he
making
a
joke
of
it
and
it
silly
of
you
not
to
do
the
same
get
up
this
minute
and
come
and
make
him
have
such
a
good
time
that
he
gladly
risk
another
shooting
to
come
again
illustration
he
was
bending
anxiously
over
a
bubbling
saucepan
it
was
a
long
time
before
gay
could
screw
her
courage
to
the
point
of
following
kitty
meekly
and
in
the
meantime
lucy
took
an
effective
way
to
make
him
forget
his
inhospitable
reception
her
chafing
dish
was
her
panacea
for
many
ills
she
had
tried
it
at
the
post
too
many
times
with
the
different
boys
who
flocked
there
not
to
know
its
full
value
so
when
gay
came
into
the
room
she
found
alex
already
being
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
with
a
white
apron
tied
around
his
waist
and
a
big
spoon
in
his
hand
he
was
bending
anxiously
over
a
bubbling
heretofore
his
calls
at
the
cabin
had
been
of
the
most
formal
kind
but
this
little
escapade
was
doing
more
to
further
their
acquaintance
and
put
him
on
the
same
privileged
footing
that
the
boys
at
the
post
enjoyed
than
dozens
of
casual
meetings
could
have
done
it
was
a
novel
experience
to
alex
and
he
made
the
most
of
it
exerting
himself
to
be
entertaining
in
hopes
of
having
the
occasion
repeated
after
the
first
painful
moment
of
greeting
and
apology
gay
subsided
into
a
corner
of
the
old
settle
but
she
did
not
stay
there
long
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
infection
of
alex
high
spirits
when
the
reaction
began
it
swung
her
to
the
farthest
extreme
into
an
irresistible
gale
of
merriment
betty
thoughts
turned
regretfully
to
the
manuscript
she
was
sorry
that
the
reading
had
been
interrupted
she
knew
the
girls
would
have
gained
a
better
impression
of
the
book
if
they
could
have
heard
it
without
this
interruption
there
was
no
telling
when
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
finish
it
as
good
as
this
would
have
been
once
she
had
a
hope
that
alex
would
not
stay
long
and
that
there
would
still
be
time
to
finish
the
reading
after
his
departure
but
while
the
candy
cooled
gay
started
lloyd
and
alex
to
singing
duets
she
and
kitty
accompanying
them
with
violin
and
piano
and
she
knew
that
it
was
useless
to
hope
any
longer
so
she
settled
down
to
enjoy
the
sweets
and
the
music
as
heartily
as
the
rest
of
them
in
one
of
the
pauses
while
they
were
searching
through
a
pile
of
songs
for
some
duet
they
wanted
lloyd
crossed
over
to
the
settle
where
lucy
was
sitting
beside
the
candy
and
helped
herself
to
a
piece
i
sorry
leland
is
missing
this
said
lucy
it
was
a
time
like
this
that
gave
him
his
nickname
of
tarrypin
he
used
to
be
devoted
to
and
came
up
to
the
post
every
time
he
thought
we
were
going
to
have
one
and
he
always
was
like
brer
tarrypin
you
know
in
the
uncle
remus
stories
how
is
that
inquired
lloyd
keenly
interested
she
knew
the
uncle
remus
stories
by
heart
and
wondered
in
what
way
this
one
had
been
applied
to
the
elegant
and
fastidious
harcourt
why
you
know
brer
he
helped
miss
meadows
bring
the
wood
brer
fox
he
mend
the
fire
brer
wolf
he
kept
the
dogs
off
brer
rabbit
he
greased
the
bottoms
of
the
plates
to
keep
the
candy
from
sticking
but
tarrypin
he
klum
up
in
a
cheer
an
say
he
watch
an
see
dat
de
did
bile
over
the
boys
always
used
to
say
that
the
only
part
in
the
game
leland
would
take
was
the
he
talk
to
their
girls
while
they
did
the
work
gay
over
at
the
piano
drew
her
brows
together
in
a
little
frown
she
wished
that
lucy
would
be
more
discreet
in
her
reminiscences
for
she
felt
that
lloyd
was
already
prejudiced
against
leland
more
than
was
desirable
she
called
out
suddenly
sister
ca
you
find
that
duet
for
us
you
had
it
last
lucy
rose
obediently
but
lingered
a
moment
to
add
as
lloyd
laughed
leland
does
mind
it
a
bit
the
boys
all
got
to
hailing
him
in
uncle
remus
fashion
brer
tarrypin
you
bin
dis
and
he
answer
as
a
matter
of
course
roun
brer
fox
lounjun
roun
it
mighty
interesting
to
know
the
history
of
a
nickname
observed
lloyd
with
an
amused
smile
which
gay
interpreted
as
meaning
that
this
bit
of
history
was
being
tucked
away
for
future
use
it
was
late
when
alex
went
home
taking
his
revolver
with
him
he
would
be
staying
all
night
near
by
with
a
friend
of
his
he
told
them
and
if
anything
else
frightened
them
they
were
to
telephone
he
come
to
their
rescue
then
he
made
the
rounds
of
all
the
windows
and
doors
seeing
that
each
was
properly
fastened
and
started
lucy
on
her
way
with
the
silver
pitcher
and
ladle
safe
in
her
hands
he
seemed
to
leave
the
sense
of
his
strong
protecting
presence
behind
him
as
they
bolted
the
door
and
heard
him
go
whistling
cheerily
down
the
road
lucy
declared
enthusiastically
he
a
nice
boy
and
he
made
us
have
such
a
jolly
evening
that
i
all
wound
up
and
do
feel
a
bit
sleepy
let
make
a
night
of
it
and
hear
the
rest
of
betty
story
it
does
make
any
difference
if
it
is
nearly
midnight
we
can
sleep
as
late
as
we
please
in
the
morning
for
jameson
here
and
we
wo
have
to
consider
his
convenience
for
once
they
were
of
the
same
mind
all
loath
to
go
to
bed
so
betty
slipped
into
a
borrowed
kimona
shook
down
her
hair
and
settled
herself
comfortably
in
a
cushioned
chair
beside
the
lamp
if
they
keep
awake
to
the
end
she
thought
that
will
be
a
good
test
i
know
then
that
it
has
real
interest
and
i
not
be
afraid
to
give
it
to
the
public
so
she
kept
an
anxious
watch
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
intending
to
stop
at
the
first
sign
of
weariness
but
the
attention
of
her
audience
was
as
profound
as
it
had
been
during
the
afternoon
stifling
an
occasional
yawn
herself
she
read
on
and
on
it
was
two
when
she
laid
aside
the
last
page
of
her
manuscript
and
looked
up
timidly
to
receive
the
verdict
lloyd
spoke
first
betty
lewis
it
perfectly
splendid
i
so
proud
of
you
i
always
been
suah
you
make
a
name
for
yoahself
some
day
but
i
nevah
dreamed
you
do
it
so
early
in
life
at
only
twenty
i
have
made
it
yet
you
know
betty
reminded
her
smiling
my
friends
may
be
willing
to
my
imperfections
by
but
i
still
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
the
critics
there
was
a
chorus
of
protests
from
the
other
girls
and
betty
heart
grew
warm
as
she
listened
to
their
cordial
praise
and
predictions
of
success
i
dying
to
have
a
finger
in
the
launching
of
this
little
bark
said
gay
let
wrap
it
up
tonight
and
have
it
all
ready
to
send
off
in
the
morning
it
would
be
so
fine
to
be
able
to
brag
to
my
grandchildren
that
helped
i
have
a
strong
flat
box
just
the
size
of
the
manuscript
i
sure
it
will
fit
it
exactly
wait
and
i
go
and
get
it
she
ran
out
of
the
room
and
while
she
rummaged
through
a
trunk
to
find
it
lucy
climbed
up
on
a
chair
to
look
on
the
wardrobe
shelf
for
some
heavy
which
she
had
folded
away
let
me
have
some
part
in
it
too
cried
kitty
although
i
no
idea
what
it
can
be
when
i
so
far
from
the
source
of
supplies
oh
i
know
now
she
said
after
an
instant
thought
you
need
a
string
to
tie
around
the
box
here
something
that
will
do
opening
the
wicker
satchel
she
had
brought
with
her
she
took
out
a
dainty
nightgown
it
was
the
work
of
only
a
moment
to
slip
out
the
fresh
new
pink
ribbons
that
had
been
run
through
the
lace
beading
now
let
me
tie
it
she
insisted
see
what
an
artistic
bow
i
can
make
when
the
manuscript
had
been
placed
in
gay
box
tied
with
ribbon
and
wrapped
in
lucy
paper
it
was
gravely
handed
over
to
lloyd
who
had
suggested
that
as
it
was
to
be
sent
by
express
it
ought
to
be
sealed
there
a
stick
of
in
the
drawer
of
the
library
table
said
lucy
if
anybody
brave
enough
to
go
down
and
get
it
at
this
sma
hour
it
must
be
nearly
three
before
she
had
finished
her
sentence
lloyd
had
lighted
a
candle
to
carry
she
was
back
in
a
moment
they
all
stood
around
in
a
circle
while
she
melted
the
red
wax
in
the
heat
of
the
candle
somebody
ought
to
say
an
abracadabra
charm
ovah
it
she
suggested
you
do
it
kitty
then
she
looked
around
her
helplessly
what
am
i
going
to
do
for
a
seal
quick
somebody
hand
me
something
off
the
the
stoppah
of
that
vinaigrette
will
do
before
lucy
could
hand
her
the
bottle
gay
caught
up
the
old
silver
ladle
and
pressed
the
end
of
its
handle
down
on
the
soft
wax
there
a
crest
on
it
she
explained
holding
it
firmly
in
place
the
motto
will
read
backwards
but
that
wo
make
any
difference
there
she
lifted
the
ladle
and
they
all
crowded
around
to
see
the
impression
left
in
the
red
wax
of
a
dagger
thrust
through
a
crown
the
tiny
reversed
letters
of
the
motto
were
undecipherable
but
gay
translated
them
jameson
says
it
the
latin
for
strive
till
i
overcome
and
a
fine
for
betty
she
striven
so
long
it
bound
to
bring
a
crown
only
that
other
thing
ought
to
be
a
pen
instead
of
a
dagger
let
me
put
one
seal
on
just
for
luck
begged
kitty
when
lloyd
had
carefully
fastened
both
ends
of
the
package
she
held
the
wax
to
the
flame
everybody
make
a
wish
she
ordered
wish
they
wished
in
silence
in
silence
they
looked
on
while
kitty
dropped
the
third
red
drop
on
the
package
and
pressed
into
it
the
crown
and
the
dagger
of
the
ladle
crest
then
they
stood
over
betty
while
she
addressed
it
to
the
publisher
to
whom
long
ago
she
had
decided
to
send
it
then
gay
laid
it
solemnly
beside
the
silver
heirlooms
as
one
of
the
things
to
be
carried
out
first
in
case
of
fire
three
and
all
is
well
called
kitty
as
the
chime
on
the
stair
began
its
warning
the
deed
is
done
and
all
the
omens
are
auspicious
that
will
be
a
scene
to
remember
always
thought
betty
gratefully
looking
around
at
the
four
pretty
girls
in
the
candlelight
as
they
made
a
ceremony
of
the
launching
of
her
little
ship
their
faces
filled
with
loving
interest
the
chickens
were
crowing
for
daylight
before
she
fell
asleep
for
she
could
not
hinder
her
happy
thoughts
from
straying
off
to
the
future
when
this
same
little
ship
should
come
home
from
sea
with
its
cargo
of
fame
and
fortune
that
the
girls
had
predicted
she
had
dedicated
the
book
simply
to
my
godmother
and
she
pictured
to
herself
the
supreme
moment
when
she
could
lay
the
published
volume
in
her
hands
she
would
send
one
to
madam
chartley
she
decided
and
one
to
miss
chilton
whose
instructions
in
english
had
been
such
an
inspiration
to
her
then
of
course
each
one
of
the
girls
must
have
one
strangers
would
write
to
her
people
would
thrill
with
pleasure
over
her
pages
as
she
had
thrilled
over
other
authors
and
oh
yes
must
have
one
of
the
very
first
copies
of
the
book
since
he
had
been
the
first
lover
of
her
stories
she
almost
sat
up
in
bed
in
the
excitement
of
her
next
thought
she
wondered
why
it
never
had
occurred
to
her
before
if
the
book
should
be
really
successful
it
would
bring
her
money
of
her
own
she
could
be
the
good
fairy
of
the
cuckoo
nest
how
many
comforts
she
could
slip
into
it
to
make
life
easier
for
poor
tired
cousin
hetty
and
could
go
away
to
that
last
thought
sent
a
warm
glad
tingle
over
her
how
good
god
had
been
to
give
her
this
delightful
way
of
making
a
road
of
the
loving
heart
in
every
one
memory
with
her
pen
she
felt
that
her
whole
life
ought
to
be
a
perpetual
thanksgiving
and
when
she
fell
asleep
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
she
was
repeating
drowsily
my
lines
have
fallen
to
me
in
pleasant
places
yea
i
have
a
goodly
heritage
chapter
v
a
camera
helps
several
days
after
his
return
from
lexington
leland
harcourt
sauntered
out
of
the
house
after
a
late
breakfast
alone
the
bored
expression
on
his
face
showed
plainly
what
he
thought
of
the
valley
as
a
summer
resort
his
brother
and
lucy
were
off
somewhere
about
the
grounds
and
for
more
than
an
hour
the
faint
sound
of
gay
violin
had
been
floating
up
from
the
rustic
arbour
which
she
claimed
as
her
private
domain
it
was
a
pleasant
little
retreat
far
back
from
the
road
in
the
dense
beech
shade
and
at
such
a
distance
from
the
house
that
her
energetic
practising
could
disturb
no
one
here
every
morning
before
the
distractions
of
the
day
began
she
religiously
devoted
an
hour
to
her
music
the
time
always
slipped
past
that
limit
if
no
one
came
to
stop
her
for
an
absorbing
devotion
to
her
work
made
her
oblivious
to
everything
else
when
her
beloved
violin
was
once
tucked
under
her
chin
scales
and
trills
and
chords
all
the
finger
exercises
that
kept
her
touch
supple
and
sure
were
gone
through
with
in
faithful
routine
then
the
new
music
she
was
mastering
had
its
share
of
careful
attention
and
after
that
she
played
on
and
on
as
a
bird
sings
from
sheer
love
of
it
she
was
improvising
when
leland
came
out
on
the
porch
a
light
rollicking
little
tune
to
fit
a
verse
from
an
uncle
remus
song
it
was
a
verse
which
alex
shelby
had
repeated
as
he
escorted
them
over
to
the
beeches
the
time
they
spent
the
night
there
the
next
night
after
their
burglar
scare
at
the
cabin
lucy
had
been
so
frightened
that
she
gladly
accepted
walton
invitation
to
stay
with
her
until
the
men
of
the
family
returned
they
had
had
such
a
good
time
now
the
recollection
of
it
was
finding
voice
in
the
tune
which
gay
was
trying
to
manufacture
for
the
words
which
alex
had
laughingly
sung
when
lucy
stuck
in
the
barb
wire
fence
on
the
way
over
hop
light
ladies
oh
miss
loo
hit
take
a
heap
er
fer
to
git
you
throo
hop
light
ladies
oh
miss
loo
gay
recalled
the
straggling
little
procession
through
the
woods
with
a
smile
as
her
bow
quavered
again
through
the
refrain
they
must
have
looked
ridiculous
there
was
lucy
lugging
the
heavy
silver
pitcher
and
jameson
ladle
because
she
was
afraid
to
leave
them
behind
and
she
herself
with
her
violin
case
and
alex
carrying
the
lindsey
spoons
and
forks
and
the
enormous
silver
because
lucy
felt
responsible
for
their
safety
since
she
had
rented
them
with
the
house
and
there
was
ranald
bringing
up
the
rear
with
their
and
kitty
laughing
at
them
all
for
bringing
these
household
gods
she
called
lucy
ephraim
joined
to
his
idols
because
she
would
not
put
down
the
pitcher
and
ladle
even
while
she
crawled
through
the
barb
wire
fence
they
had
cut
across
lots
in
the
twilight
instead
of
going
around
by
the
road
not
wanting
to
be
seen
with
a
load
which
looked
so
much
like
burglar
booty
if
leland
only
could
have
been
with
us
then
thought
gay
regretfully
and
the
night
before
that
when
we
had
such
a
jolly
time
with
the
taffy
and
the
duets
he
would
have
been
on
a
real
friendly
footing
with
them
all
by
this
time
but
he
beginning
to
find
it
dull
i
know
he
is
he
be
off
again
before
long
if
we
ca
get
him
interested
in
something
while
she
was
worrying
over
his
evident
restlessness
and
discontent
the
odour
of
his
cigar
came
floating
out
to
her
and
she
knew
by
that
token
that
he
had
finished
breakfast
and
needed
to
be
amused
locking
her
violin
in
its
case
she
carried
it
back
to
the
house
prepared
to
shoulder
her
share
of
this
responsibility
good
morning
brer
tarrypin
she
called
as
she
came
in
sight
of
him
lolling
in
the
hammock
lounjoun
roun
as
usual
i
see
well
the
mail
train
is
in
so
you
can
come
with
me
to
the
as
soon
as
i
get
my
hat
good
heavens
pug
he
groaned
i
vow
you
worse
than
a
little
volcano
always
in
action
nevertheless
he
got
up
as
she
knew
he
would
and
strolled
along
beside
her
the
road
in
front
of
the
was
almost
blocked
with
carriages
on
summer
mornings
like
this
nearly
every
one
in
the
valley
found
some
excuse
to
be
at
the
station
when
the
mail
train
came
in
for
while
they
waited
for
the
delivery
window
to
open
there
was
time
not
only
to
attend
to
the
day
marketing
but
to
meet
all
one
friends
at
such
times
the
little
box
of
a
was
the
very
centre
of
neighbourhood
sociability
and
since
everybody
knew
everybody
else
the
gathering
was
as
informal
as
a
family
reunion
even
gay
felt
like
an
old
settler
her
previous
visit
to
the
valley
had
given
her
so
many
acquaintances
as
she
passed
down
the
straggling
line
of
men
and
boys
who
were
leaning
against
the
fence
or
sitting
on
the
top
rail
while
they
waited
hats
were
swept
off
as
if
a
sudden
breeze
had
scurried
along
the
path
several
of
the
old
confederate
soldiers
spoke
her
name
as
they
saluted
she
had
played
for
them
up
at
the
home
twice
on
that
former
visit
oh
the
dear
little
queer
little
valley
she
began
but
was
interrupted
by
leland
calling
her
attention
to
the
sherman
carriage
which
was
moving
in
and
out
at
a
snail
pace
through
the
blockade
of
vehicles
stopping
repeatedly
as
greetings
were
called
out
to
it
from
the
other
carriages
gay
face
brightened
as
she
saw
lloyd
on
the
back
seat
looking
as
fresh
as
a
snowdrop
in
her
white
linen
dress
oh
if
she
only
ask
us
up
to
locust
to
spend
the
morning
thought
gay
so
earnestly
that
it
seemed
to
her
that
lloyd
must
feel
the
force
of
the
she
was
trying
to
project
it
high
time
for
her
to
remember
her
promise
if
she
expects
to
accomplish
anything
lloyd
was
remembering
her
promise
it
recurred
to
her
the
instant
that
she
caught
sight
of
leland
dark
interesting
face
as
he
turned
the
corner
as
instantly
she
had
looked
away
remembering
how
pointedly
he
had
ignored
her
that
night
at
the
cabin
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
since
now
gay
request
seemed
utterly
absurd
the
colour
surged
up
in
her
face
as
she
remembered
her
high
resolve
about
lighting
a
vestal
fire
on
the
altar
of
a
promise
how
ridiculous
of
her
to
have
worked
herself
up
into
such
an
exalted
mood
over
nothing
a
positive
dislike
for
the
man
who
had
been
the
cause
of
it
took
possession
of
her
and
she
wished
heartily
that
she
need
never
meet
him
again
but
an
encounter
could
not
be
avoided
long
gay
was
pushing
eagerly
through
the
crowd
towards
the
carriage
she
would
call
her
in
a
moment
then
she
would
have
to
turn
around
and
at
least
be
decently
polite
just
then
a
stylish
little
runabout
stopped
opposite
the
carriage
and
a
lady
leaned
out
to
accost
lloyd
thankful
for
the
opportunity
lloyd
turned
her
back
squarely
on
the
and
plunged
into
an
animated
conversation
without
glancing
in
their
direction
she
was
conscious
that
gay
and
harcourt
were
on
the
curbstone
directly
behind
her
and
would
come
up
the
moment
that
she
stopped
talking
yes
of
miss
jennie
they
heard
her
say
i
going
to
town
on
the
next
car
and
i
be
glad
to
get
it
for
you
yes
we
all
going
in
for
a
day
shopping
mothah
and
betty
are
ovah
at
the
trolley
station
now
waiting
for
me
to
get
the
mail
miss
jennie
giving
voluble
directions
began
hunting
through
her
pocketbook
for
a
sample
of
ribbon
which
she
wanted
matched
gay
hopes
fell
she
had
counted
confidently
on
taking
leland
up
to
the
locusts
to
spend
the
morning
but
just
then
lloyd
waved
her
handkerchief
to
some
one
coming
down
the
avenue
and
turning
gay
face
brightened
it
was
kitty
walton
to
whom
lloyd
had
waved
strolling
along
under
a
white
parasol
in
a
pale
pink
dress
and
with
a
great
bunch
of
sweet
peas
in
her
hand
she
looked
so
attractive
that
gay
felt
that
leland
would
find
the
beeches
fully
as
entertaining
a
as
the
locusts
she
decided
to
take
him
up
there
again
she
was
doomed
to
disappointment
for
kitty
cordial
greeting
was
followed
by
the
almost
breathless
announcement
that
she
was
about
to
take
her
departure
from
the
valley
oh
when
called
lloyd
turning
to
the
girls
with
the
friendliest
of
smiles
and
acknowledging
harcourt
greeting
with
a
frosty
little
bow
when
where
and
whyfoah
this
evening
answered
kitty
over
to
the
martinsville
springs
in
indiana
and
because
mother
is
firmly
convinced
that
they
are
the
panacea
for
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
really
they
do
help
her
wonderfully
and
she
needs
the
change
and
i
like
the
place
myself
so
i
not
sorry
to
go
for
some
reasons
but
i
do
hate
to
take
ten
whole
days
out
of
your
visit
gay
you
ca
hate
it
half
as
much
as
i
do
answered
gay
gloomily
who
had
not
overlooked
lloyd
cool
little
bow
to
leland
for
lloyd
to
act
snippy
and
kitty
to
be
away
ten
whole
days
right
in
the
beginning
of
things
was
fatal
to
all
her
plans
it
was
just
then
that
help
came
from
a
most
unexpected
source
not
that
she
realized
then
that
it
was
help
but
weeks
afterward
she
traced
back
several
important
things
to
that
small
beginning
miss
katherine
marks
came
out
of
the
with
a
handful
of
letters
she
was
about
to
pass
the
group
beside
the
sherman
carriage
with
only
a
brief
good
morning
when
the
sight
of
kitty
sweet
peas
made
her
pause
that
reminds
me
kitty
she
said
i
finished
mounting
that
garden
photograph
you
may
see
it
now
whenever
you
come
over
i
come
right
now
miss
katherine
was
the
eager
response
i
wild
to
see
it
and
as
we
going
to
martinsville
this
evening
this
will
be
my
only
chance
seeing
the
unspoken
wish
in
gay
eager
eyes
miss
marks
included
all
of
them
in
the
invitation
lloyd
glanced
at
her
watch
and
excused
herself
finding
that
the
car
she
wanted
to
take
was
almost
due
she
would
have
to
hurry
to
reach
the
station
she
said
but
even
in
her
haste
she
noticed
that
leland
did
not
join
in
the
regret
which
the
others
expressed
and
grown
unduly
sensitive
in
regard
to
his
opinion
she
fancied
that
he
looked
pleased
when
she
refused
he
lifted
his
hat
perfunctorily
not
even
glancing
at
her
as
he
moved
away
seemingly
absorbed
in
adjusting
kitty
parasol
which
he
had
taken
possession
of
and
was
holding
over
her
gay
walked
on
with
miss
marks
kitty
had
to
stop
a
moment
at
the
bisbee
cottage
to
leave
the
sweet
peas
with
a
message
from
her
mother
leland
waited
for
her
at
the
gate
what
is
this
you
getting
me
into
he
asked
nodding
towards
miss
marks
and
gay
who
were
almost
out
of
sight
if
he
had
asked
the
question
of
gay
she
would
have
explained
eagerly
that
they
were
on
their
way
to
clovercroft
to
see
a
collection
of
amateur
photographs
which
had
taken
prizes
and
gold
medals
all
over
the
country
and
among
them
were
three
at
least
that
she
knew
he
would
want
so
desperately
that
he
would
fall
all
over
himself
trying
to
get
them
but
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
try
he
could
neither
beg
borrow
buy
nor
steal
them
he
might
thank
his
lucky
stars
that
he
was
permitted
just
to
stand
afar
off
and
gaze
at
them
in
hopeless
admiration
but
kitty
instead
of
enlightening
him
in
any
such
way
turned
the
talk
into
channels
of
more
personal
interest
and
made
the
short
stroll
so
agreeable
that
it
came
to
an
end
entirely
too
soon
he
followed
her
through
the
gate
wishing
that
he
could
invent
some
excuse
whereby
to
prolong
the
pleasure
of
making
her
blush
and
seeing
her
dark
eyes
look
up
laughingly
at
him
from
under
the
white
parasol
at
the
same
time
he
wanted
to
escape
the
bore
of
being
expected
to
grow
enthusiastic
over
some
amateur
collection
in
which
he
felt
no
interest
something
of
this
he
expressed
in
an
undertone
to
kitty
as
they
stepped
up
on
to
the
porch
do
flatter
yourself
she
advised
him
dropping
into
a
seat
that
you
be
allowed
a
peep
into
miss
katherine
studio
strangers
never
get
any
farther
than
the
court
of
the
gentiles
gay
has
gone
in
he
answered
and
her
introduction
antedates
mine
not
more
than
two
seconds
why
should
i
gay
is
one
of
the
elect
she
has
the
artist
soul
herself
and
miss
katherine
recognizes
the
earmarks
you
insinuate
that
i
have
them
kitty
smiled
tantalizingly
and
swung
her
parasol
back
and
forth
by
its
ivory
crook
no
indeed
i
not
insinuating
anything
i
simply
stating
a
broad
truth
you
ca
get
in
she
bring
out
dozens
of
pictures
for
your
inspection
but
she
not
invite
you
inside
that
studio
very
few
people
are
so
favoured
up
to
that
moment
he
had
not
had
the
faintest
wish
to
set
foot
inside
the
studio
but
her
provoking
assertions
suddenly
seemed
to
make
it
the
one
desirable
spot
for
him
to
enter
i
show
you
he
declared
rashly
i
see
it
before
we
leave
here
i
always
get
what
i
want
now
watch
me
miss
marks
came
out
with
a
large
photograph
exquisitely
tinted
so
artistic
it
was
both
in
colouring
and
composition
that
admiration
was
as
great
as
his
surprise
he
had
expected
to
see
some
little
snap
shots
such
as
he
had
made
himself
when
he
had
the
kodak
fever
the
kind
that
are
interesting
only
to
those
who
take
them
and
those
who
are
taken
this
was
so
beautiful
that
no
sooner
was
it
in
his
hands
than
he
was
fired
with
a
desire
to
possess
it
it
was
the
picture
of
a
rose
garden
every
bush
a
glory
of
bloom
and
in
the
path
her
pink
dress
caught
by
a
clinging
brier
was
kitty
herself
like
another
rose
looking
down
over
her
shoulder
at
the
bramble
which
held
her
a
prisoner
in
its
thorny
clasp
it
is
to
illustrate
a
explained
miss
marks
when
naughty
esmerelda
runs
away
from
the
good
prince
everything
in
the
garden
is
in
league
to
help
him
and
brier
rose
catches
at
her
skirts
as
she
hurries
by
and
holds
her
fast
is
it
lovely
cried
gay
flashing
out
of
the
studio
with
an
armful
which
miss
marks
had
given
her
permission
to
show
here
betty
taken
as
a
nun
and
lloyd
as
an
easter
angel
perfectly
fascinating
to
hear
miss
marks
tell
how
she
got
that
effect
of
flying
arranged
the
draperies
with
lloyd
lying
on
the
floor
and
photographed
her
from
a
trap
door
above
tell
him
how
you
added
the
doves
wings
please
much
to
her
surprise
miss
marks
found
herself
telling
things
to
this
young
man
that
she
would
not
have
dreamed
of
telling
to
another
stranger
some
of
the
remarkable
makeshifts
she
had
used
in
costumes
and
backgrounds
his
flattering
air
of
interest
drew
these
confidences
from
her
as
irresistibly
as
a
magnet
draws
steel
you
ought
to
do
a
series
of
these
garden
pictures
he
declared
and
call
them
fancies
after
that
poem
of
browning
by
the
way
there
is
a
couplet
in
that
which
would
lend
itself
charmingly
to
illustration
and
i
saw
the
very
garden
that
you
should
use
for
it
while
i
was
out
driving
yesterday
it
was
one
of
those
straight
walk
prim
bordered
affairs
that
go
with
old
english
cottages
he
could
have
found
no
surer
path
to
miss
marks
good
graces
gay
not
knowing
that
he
had
a
purpose
to
gain
by
it
listened
in
amazement
as
he
proceeded
to
outline
picture
after
picture
for
the
series
of
garden
fancies
even
planning
costumes
and
suggesting
clever
means
by
which
various
obstacles
might
be
overcome
her
astonishment
showed
itself
in
her
face
when
he
even
consented
to
pose
himself
as
a
spanish
troubadour
in
a
moonlit
garden
with
a
guitar
kitty
who
knew
the
object
of
this
sudden
interest
in
photography
laughed
outright
but
nobody
noticed
her
irrelevant
mirth
miss
marks
was
too
interested
in
the
new
plan
and
gay
was
too
puzzled
over
his
rapidly
growing
enthusiasm
presently
darting
a
triumphant
look
at
kitty
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
rose
to
follow
miss
marks
she
was
actually
taking
him
into
her
inner
courts
kitty
made
a
little
grimace
behind
his
back
she
resented
his
air
but
she
could
not
help
admiring
the
masterful
way
in
which
he
had
gained
his
end
one
hasty
glance
around
the
studio
changed
his
assumed
interest
into
real
impressed
by
the
wonderful
results
miss
marks
had
obtained
by
the
combination
of
brush
and
camera
he
was
seized
by
a
wish
to
do
something
in
the
same
line
himself
accustomed
to
the
impulsiveness
of
his
enthusiasms
gay
was
not
surprised
when
he
began
to
persuade
miss
marks
to
start
to
work
on
the
garden
fancies
then
and
there
the
english
garden
was
too
far
away
for
them
to
attempt
that
morning
but
miss
marks
finally
agreed
that
the
moonlight
scene
might
be
managed
it
was
just
the
right
time
of
day
to
take
a
moonlight
picture
while
the
sunshine
was
so
direct
that
it
would
cast
the
blackest
of
shadows
she
could
retouch
the
plate
to
give
it
the
right
effect
and
paint
in
a
moon
you
have
to
hurry
if
i
to
be
in
it
ordered
kitty
for
mother
is
waiting
for
me
this
blessed
minute
i
a
world
of
things
to
do
in
the
next
few
hours
give
us
just
a
quarter
of
one
of
them
begged
leland
i
attend
to
the
balcony
part
if
miss
marks
will
look
after
the
costumes
and
tell
me
where
to
find
a
leland
has
plenty
to
amuse
him
now
thought
gay
happily
as
she
watched
him
giving
directions
to
frazer
the
coloured
man
who
came
in
answer
to
miss
marks
call
his
foot
is
on
his
native
heath
and
his
name
when
it
comes
to
a
thing
of
this
sort
ten
minutes
later
kitty
found
herself
looking
out
of
an
improvised
balcony
a
charming
affair
outwardly
but
most
laughable
within
a
tall
had
been
dragged
into
the
bay
window
of
the
music
room
and
the
upper
sash
of
the
middle
window
pushed
down
from
the
top
the
thick
vines
that
grew
over
it
were
pulled
back
to
leave
an
oval
opening
it
was
out
of
this
leafy
oval
she
leaned
from
her
seat
on
the
top
of
the
ladder
to
smile
down
on
the
troubadour
below
there
was
a
rose
in
her
dark
hair
a
fan
in
her
hand
and
a
coquettish
glance
in
her
laughing
black
eyes
leland
costume
had
been
hastily
constructed
from
scraps
of
stage
property
kept
for
such
occasions
it
took
but
a
moment
to
drape
a
long
cape
over
one
shoulder
in
graceful
folds
twist
a
piece
of
velvet
into
a
little
cap
and
pin
a
white
plume
on
one
side
a
row
of
potted
plants
laboriously
put
in
place
by
frazer
hid
the
fact
that
he
wore
modern
trousers
instead
of
the
more
picturesque
knee
breeches
which
such
a
costume
demanded
fire
away
he
ordered
adjusting
the
guitar
to
a
more
comfortable
position
suppose
you
sing
a
verse
of
a
real
serenade
suggested
miss
marks
so
as
to
get
into
the
proper
spirit
of
the
thing
then
just
as
you
finish
while
you
looking
soulfully
into
each
other
eyes
i
squeeze
the
bulb
kitty
seeing
the
seamy
side
of
his
improvised
cap
and
feeling
the
absurdity
of
her
position
on
the
top
of
the
could
only
giggle
when
she
tried
to
look
soulful
but
leland
had
taken
part
in
too
many
private
theatricals
to
be
disconcerted
now
with
as
impassioned
a
gaze
as
any
romeo
ever
fixed
on
his
juliet
he
struck
the
soft
chords
of
a
spanish
serenade
and
began
to
sing
so
meaningly
that
kitty
giggle
was
silenced
and
she
looked
down
with
a
conscious
blush
thine
eyes
are
stars
of
morning
thy
lips
are
crimson
flowers
good
night
good
night
beloved
while
i
count
the
weary
hours
there
that
ought
to
be
perfect
cried
miss
marks
emerging
from
under
the
black
cloth
which
covered
the
camera
harcourt
you
the
most
satisfactory
man
i
ever
had
pose
for
me
it
easy
enough
to
get
a
score
of
pretty
girls
any
time
i
need
them
but
it
is
once
in
a
decade
one
finds
such
an
altogether
desirable
model
of
a
man
you
seem
to
know
by
intuition
exactly
the
right
positions
to
fall
into
i
sure
the
series
will
be
a
success
now
leland
bowed
his
appreciation
of
the
compliment
and
gay
knowing
his
vulnerable
spot
and
how
secretly
pleased
he
was
could
have
danced
a
breakdown
in
her
delight
as
they
were
all
eager
to
see
the
result
miss
marks
took
herself
at
once
to
the
dark
room
with
the
plate
promising
they
should
have
a
proof
before
time
for
the
martinsville
train
then
gay
and
leland
walked
home
with
kitty
and
stayed
talking
awhile
on
the
shady
porch
it
been
a
very
decent
sort
of
morning
leland
admitted
on
his
way
home
to
lunch
a
siesta
in
the
hammock
shortened
the
afternoon
he
was
in
a
most
agreeable
mood
when
they
drove
over
to
the
station
to
see
the
waltons
off
on
their
train
better
than
her
promise
miss
marks
had
sent
a
finished
picture
instead
of
a
proof
it
was
fully
as
good
as
the
one
of
brier
rose
and
esmerelda
and
leland
was
enthusiastic
in
his
admiration
of
the
balcony
he
had
improvised
and
the
spanish
beauty
within
it
when
it
had
passed
around
the
circle
he
coolly
took
possession
of
it
although
kitty
claimed
it
as
frazer
had
brought
it
up
to
the
beeches
i
keep
it
till
your
return
miss
kitty
he
said
you
have
your
mirror
so
you
do
need
this
it
may
inspire
me
to
run
over
to
the
springs
myself
a
few
days
to
see
the
original
if
you
stay
away
too
long
something
in
the
light
tone
made
gay
glance
up
quickly
she
groaned
as
she
saw
the
admiration
his
expressive
eyes
showed
so
plainly
now
he
gone
and
done
it
she
thought
in
dismay
he
taken
a
fancy
to
kitty
instead
of
lloyd
when
i
set
my
heart
on
saving
kitty
for
frank
percival
may
blessings
light
on
those
old
martinsville
springs
for
taking
her
out
of
the
way
for
awhile
maybe
i
can
get
him
switched
off
on
the
other
track
before
she
comes
back
chapter
vi
garden
fancies
oh
where
are
you
going
my
pretty
maid
it
was
alex
shelby
who
called
out
the
question
leaning
forward
from
the
doctor
buggy
to
look
down
the
locust
avenue
lloyd
was
coming
toward
the
gate
swinging
a
horn
back
and
forth
by
its
green
cord
she
waved
it
gaily
as
she
sang
in
response
i
going
a
posing
sir
she
said
he
turned
the
wheel
and
sprang
out
asking
eagerly
is
it
anywhere
that
i
can
take
you
no
you
going
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
for
i
bound
for
the
spring
in
the
lindsey
woods
miss
marks
asked
me
to
meet
her
there
at
eleven
but
her
note
did
come
until
aftah
mothah
had
gone
out
with
the
carriage
alex
glanced
at
his
watch
if
you
could
wait
till
i
take
this
case
of
instruments
up
to
uncle
i
could
drive
you
over
as
well
as
not
it
would
detain
you
ten
minutes
but
even
then
you
get
to
the
spring
much
sooner
than
if
you
were
to
walk
i
certainly
accept
yoah
offah
exclaimed
lloyd
gratefully
looking
down
the
long
hot
way
that
lay
between
her
and
the
lindsey
woods
no
i
not
drive
ovah
to
the
doctah
with
you
thanks
that
is
such
a
hot
dusty
stretch
of
road
i
just
sit
heah
in
the
shade
and
wait
laying
the
hunter
horn
on
the
stone
bench
near
the
gate
she
sat
down
beside
it
and
began
to
fan
herself
with
her
hat
what
going
on
at
the
spring
he
asked
as
he
climbed
back
into
the
buggy
i
ca
tell
you
all
i
know
is
that
old
frazer
came
up
with
a
note
asking
me
to
pose
as
olga
the
maiden
miss
marks
is
always
illustrating
some
old
she
wanted
me
to
bring
grandfathah
hunting
hawn
for
the
prince
i
been
wondering
evah
since
who
she
found
to
take
that
paht
harcourt
i
bet
you
anything
was
alex
emphatic
answer
as
he
gathered
up
the
reins
i
saw
him
over
at
clovercroft
yesterday
morning
setting
up
a
tripod
in
front
of
the
bay
window
well
here
goes
i
be
back
in
ten
minutes
as
lloyd
watched
the
cloud
of
dust
whirling
along
behind
the
rapidly
disappearing
buggy
the
impulse
seized
her
to
call
out
after
him
that
he
need
come
back
to
take
her
to
the
spring
for
she
was
not
going
several
times
that
morning
the
suspicion
had
crossed
her
mind
that
miss
marks
new
model
might
prove
to
be
leland
harcourt
and
alex
emphatic
answer
seemed
to
confirm
her
misgivings
if
that
were
the
case
she
felt
that
she
could
not
possibly
go
he
had
made
such
a
point
of
avoiding
her
that
night
at
the
cabin
that
even
betty
had
noticed
it
and
she
was
very
sure
she
did
want
to
have
her
picture
taken
with
a
man
who
had
showed
his
aversion
to
her
so
plainly
as
all
that
it
would
be
horribly
awkward
she
thought
if
miss
marks
had
asked
him
to
pose
with
her
he
would
have
to
stoop
and
drink
out
of
her
hands
as
the
prince
had
done
out
of
olga
of
course
he
could
refuse
and
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
him
and
embarrassing
to
her
knowing
as
she
did
how
he
felt
towards
her
it
was
unlike
lloyd
to
be
sensitive
over
little
things
and
to
magnify
trifles
and
she
had
been
unhappy
for
several
days
because
she
had
done
so
in
this
instance
if
she
had
met
leland
harcourt
like
any
other
stranger
she
would
not
have
given
his
manner
toward
her
a
second
thought
but
gay
plea
beforehand
in
his
behalf
made
her
of
course
he
could
possibly
know
that
she
had
lain
awake
looking
at
the
stars
picturing
herself
as
a
sort
of
guardian
angel
who
should
lead
him
to
great
heights
of
achievement
as
gay
had
assured
her
she
could
do
but
she
felt
that
he
must
have
divined
her
intentions
toward
him
and
was
secretly
amused
at
her
presumption
her
face
burned
every
time
she
thought
of
the
regal
manner
in
which
she
had
swept
into
the
room
trying
to
make
her
entrance
impressive
and
then
the
polite
way
in
which
he
had
handed
her
over
to
some
one
else
as
if
she
were
a
mere
child
to
whom
he
must
be
civil
but
whose
prattle
bored
him
i
ca
him
she
said
in
a
disgusted
tone
to
a
black
ant
which
was
crawling
along
towards
the
stone
bench
where
she
sat
but
the
little
ant
intent
on
its
own
affairs
hurried
past
her
as
unheedingly
as
if
she
had
been
part
of
the
bench
and
i
suppose
my
opinion
is
of
no
moah
impawtance
to
him
than
it
is
to
you
she
added
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
then
she
laughed
for
the
comparison
suddenly
seemed
to
put
the
affair
in
a
different
light
i
certainly
glad
you
happened
along
this
way
mistah
ant
she
said
bending
over
to
stop
him
with
a
stick
while
she
made
her
whimsical
speech
because
i
going
to
profit
by
yoah
example
from
now
on
heah
me
i
going
to
quit
worrying
over
what
people
may
think
of
me
and
go
along
about
my
business
just
as
you
are
doing
nevah
think
about
yoahself
do
you
you
do
even
know
that
you
a
self
so
of
you
ca
feel
slighted
and
sensitive
lifting
the
stick
so
that
the
little
creature
might
go
on
its
eager
way
again
she
watched
it
disappear
and
then
began
idly
tracing
figures
in
the
dust
at
her
feet
i
wish
i
had
an
enchanted
necklace
like
olga
she
mused
recalling
the
old
for
which
she
was
soon
to
pose
not
one
that
could
give
me
gorgeous
dresses
whenevah
i
repeated
the
charm
but
one
that
would
sawt
of
clothe
my
mind
put
me
into
such
a
beautifully
serene
mental
state
that
i
would
mind
slights
and
would
be
as
unconscious
of
self
as
that
little
old
ant
then
a
surprised
pleased
expression
lighted
her
face
as
a
sudden
recollection
seemed
to
illuminate
the
old
and
give
it
a
new
meaning
why
it
like
that
lovely
verse
in
the
psalms
that
miss
allison
read
to
the
king
daughters
the
first
time
i
went
to
a
meeting
of
the
circle
king
daughter
is
all
glorious
within
her
clothing
is
of
wrought
sentences
from
miss
allison
earnest
little
talk
of
long
ago
began
coming
back
to
lloyd
like
fragments
of
forgotten
music
something
about
being
anointed
with
the
oil
of
gladness
and
wearing
garments
that
smelled
of
myrrh
and
aloes
and
cassia
out
of
the
ivory
palaces
whereby
they
have
made
thee
glad
now
in
the
story
when
olga
would
change
her
gown
of
tow
to
one
befitting
her
royal
station
she
had
only
to
clasp
a
bead
of
her
magic
rosary
and
whisper
for
love
sweet
sake
in
my
hour
of
need
blossom
and
deck
me
little
seed
and
straightway
she
would
be
clad
in
a
garment
fine
and
fair
as
the
shimmer
of
moonbeams
and
lloyd
casting
about
in
her
mind
for
a
like
charm
that
would
make
her
all
glorious
within
as
olga
made
her
glorious
without
suddenly
bethought
herself
of
her
little
necklace
of
roman
pearls
she
had
not
taken
it
back
to
school
with
her
in
her
senior
year
for
she
felt
that
she
had
outgrown
its
childish
symbolism
she
could
keep
tryst
with
life
obligations
now
without
the
visible
reminder
of
a
little
white
bead
slipped
daily
over
a
silken
cord
still
it
had
helped
her
to
remember
so
many
times
in
the
past
that
she
was
strongly
tempted
to
try
the
efficacy
of
her
little
talisman
just
once
more
glancing
at
her
watch
she
saw
that
alex
had
been
gone
only
five
minutes
then
dropping
the
stick
with
which
she
had
been
writing
in
the
dust
she
ran
lightly
up
the
avenue
into
the
house
and
up
to
her
room
maybe
it
is
sawt
of
childish
she
thought
as
she
opened
the
box
and
clasped
the
rosary
around
her
neck
but
i
care
if
it
will
only
help
me
to
remembah
not
to
be
snippy
and
sensitive
and
to
go
about
my
business
like
that
little
black
ant
it
funny
how
such
a
little
thing
started
me
on
the
right
path
when
alex
came
back
she
met
him
with
such
a
shining
face
that
he
glanced
at
her
curiously
you
look
as
if
you
had
heard
good
news
he
said
as
he
helped
her
into
the
buggy
what
happened
oh
nothing
she
laughed
i
just
been
practising
my
paht
while
i
waited
for
you
i
the
princess
olga
and
i
gotten
rid
of
my
gown
of
tow
and
i
so
relieved
to
find
the
real
attire
that
i
as
happy
as
a
he
did
not
understand
her
allusion
but
it
would
have
made
no
difference
if
she
had
talked
to
him
in
greek
with
that
charming
dimple
coming
and
going
as
she
laughed
it
was
a
pleasure
just
to
sit
and
watch
her
while
she
rattled
on
in
her
inimitable
way
about
wondering
how
happy
they
were
anyhow
and
why
people
chose
them
as
the
unit
of
measurement
when
they
were
measuring
joy
over
at
the
spring
while
they
waited
for
lloyd
to
come
miss
marks
and
leland
harcourt
experimented
at
with
gay
for
a
victim
stretched
out
on
the
rocks
of
the
creek
bank
with
her
hands
lying
in
the
shallow
water
and
her
hair
streaming
over
her
shoulders
she
was
obligingly
trying
to
obey
instructions
to
look
as
wet
and
dead
as
possible
lloyd
and
alex
coming
on
her
unexpectedly
as
they
picked
their
way
up
the
ravine
having
tied
the
horse
where
the
woodland
road
ended
were
horrified
to
find
her
lying
there
so
limp
and
still
but
the
next
instant
leland
voice
sounded
somewhere
up
among
the
bushes
great
pug
try
to
keep
the
pose
a
little
longer
till
we
get
one
more
plate
with
a
and
some
rolling
waves
painted
in
in
the
background
it
will
be
a
perfect
copy
of
that
painting
i
saw
in
brittany
well
hurry
please
called
gay
plaintively
i
ca
stand
it
much
longer
the
sun
on
my
wet
face
is
burning
it
to
a
blister
and
the
rocks
are
cutting
my
elbow
and
i
know
it
a
spider
that
crawling
over
the
back
of
my
neck
lloyd
gave
a
toot
of
the
hunter
horn
to
warn
them
of
their
approach
and
the
extra
plate
was
never
made
for
with
a
little
shriek
the
drowned
fishermaiden
scrambled
up
from
the
rocks
in
embarrassed
haste
and
when
she
caught
sight
of
alex
fled
away
into
the
bushes
to
gather
up
her
dishevelled
hair
and
otherwise
put
herself
to
rights
she
was
too
agitated
to
notice
lloyd
meeting
with
leland
but
while
she
made
herself
presentable
the
sound
of
laughter
floated
in
among
the
bushes
to
her
most
reassuringly
they
laughing
at
me
she
thought
but
i
do
care
how
ridiculous
i
looked
break
the
ice
between
them
and
put
them
on
a
friendly
footing
at
the
sight
of
leland
dark
face
with
its
cynical
slightly
amused
expression
lloyd
resentment
returned
but
the
touch
of
the
little
necklace
recalled
her
resolve
i
be
snippy
and
sensitive
she
repeated
to
herself
clasping
one
of
the
beads
in
her
fingers
as
if
it
really
held
some
potent
charm
to
help
her
change
her
mental
attitude
so
when
gay
joined
them
she
found
that
lloyd
had
dropped
her
distant
disdainful
manner
of
the
day
before
and
was
her
own
sweet
winsome
self
it
was
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
gay
left
them
to
the
discussion
of
poses
and
costumes
and
turned
to
alex
who
was
about
to
take
his
departure
the
one
word
picnic
was
enough
to
stop
him
it
was
what
he
had
been
hoping
for
ever
since
the
harcourts
had
taken
the
cabin
appeal
for
help
set
him
to
work
with
the
zest
of
a
truant
while
he
made
a
fire
and
carried
water
from
the
spring
gay
emptied
the
baskets
they
had
brought
and
spread
the
contents
out
on
a
great
flat
rock
then
while
the
water
boiled
for
the
coffee
and
the
potatoes
were
roasting
in
the
ashes
she
sent
him
to
look
for
a
wild
i
want
a
lot
of
to
make
into
little
baskets
to
serve
the
berries
in
she
told
him
and
bring
them
up
here
where
i
can
keep
an
eye
on
what
is
going
on
at
the
spring
there
seems
to
be
a
hitch
in
the
performance
somewhere
the
difficulty
was
with
the
prince
costume
nothing
they
had
brought
gave
quite
the
effect
they
wanted
so
finally
leland
proposed
bringing
the
story
down
to
date
the
modern
princess
is
the
summer
girl
he
said
so
take
miss
sherman
just
as
she
is
and
i
go
back
to
the
cabin
and
put
on
a
bicycle
suit
illustration
making
a
cup
of
her
white
hands
they
are
getting
on
famously
thought
gay
as
she
listened
to
merry
response
to
something
he
called
back
as
he
went
crashing
away
through
the
bushes
the
last
little
basket
was
made
and
filled
with
berries
before
leland
came
back
dragging
his
wheel
up
the
ravine
gay
and
alex
having
finished
their
preparations
climbed
up
the
bank
to
watch
the
pretty
tableau
lloyd
making
a
cup
of
her
white
hands
and
catching
the
water
in
them
that
the
prince
might
stoop
and
drink
let
try
it
again
miss
marks
cried
leland
enthusiastically
how
is
this
pose
he
dropped
gracefully
to
one
knee
baring
his
head
as
he
bowed
it
over
lloyd
hands
is
the
change
in
him
or
is
it
in
me
thought
lloyd
as
the
dark
eager
face
smiled
up
at
her
with
its
quick
flashing
smile
that
she
found
so
peculiarly
attractive
he
certainly
is
the
most
entahtaining
man
i
evah
talked
to
the
show
is
over
called
gay
as
miss
marks
began
to
put
up
her
camera
if
your
royal
highnesses
will
deign
to
descend
dinner
will
be
served
immediately
it
was
an
attractive
table
she
led
them
to
the
red
berries
shining
in
luscious
heaps
in
their
little
green
baskets
mounds
of
fresh
watercress
beside
every
plate
and
a
big
bouquet
of
wildflowers
in
the
centre
of
the
rock
table
what
is
the
peculiar
charm
of
a
picnic
queried
alex
as
he
fished
an
ant
out
of
the
sugar
and
opened
a
potato
at
home
one
would
send
such
a
dish
back
to
the
kitchen
in
wrath
here
one
eats
it
in
a
sort
of
solemn
joy
it
the
spell
of
the
june
woods
suggested
miss
marks
no
it
youth
in
the
blood
said
leland
all
the
junes
in
the
world
and
all
outdoors
would
make
a
potato
fit
for
the
gods
unless
one
has
sun
and
the
wind
in
his
pulses
no
insisted
gay
it
ca
be
that
for
jameson
is
much
older
than
you
and
he
despises
prowling
around
in
the
woods
as
he
calls
it
he
made
so
much
fun
of
it
that
lucy
went
driving
with
him
instead
of
coming
with
us
and
she
adores
such
outings
just
as
much
now
as
she
did
before
she
was
married
maybe
no
one
feels
the
charm
unless
the
gods
have
given
him
a
sort
of
midas
touch
that
will
turn
everything
disagreeable
like
ants
and
underdone
potatoes
into
golden
experiences
said
alex
the
midas
imagination
let
us
call
it
and
the
way
to
keep
it
in
good
working
order
is
to
give
it
constant
practice
let
have
a
picnic
every
day
announced
leland
i
take
you
all
over
to
that
old
english
garden
that
i
discovered
to
take
that
garden
fancy
of
browning
we
were
discussing
gay
looked
up
quickly
it
had
been
understood
only
yesterday
that
they
were
to
wait
for
kitty
return
for
that
picture
his
taking
it
for
granted
that
lloyd
would
assume
the
part
augured
well
for
her
hopes
you
know
that
poem
of
browning
do
you
miss
sherman
he
asked
smiling
across
at
her
now
lloyd
had
never
cared
for
browning
in
fact
she
frankly
admitted
that
she
had
never
got
far
enough
into
many
of
his
poems
to
know
what
he
was
talking
about
at
warwick
hall
miss
chilton
had
been
such
an
enthusiastic
interpreter
of
his
that
ten
of
the
girls
in
lloyd
class
had
formed
a
browning
club
although
she
declined
their
invitation
to
join
them
she
was
more
complimented
by
that
invitation
than
any
other
of
that
school
term
and
envied
them
their
apparent
enjoyment
of
what
to
her
was
a
tangle
of
vague
meanings
now
when
she
saw
leland
take
a
well
worn
copy
from
his
pocket
and
flip
over
the
leaves
to
find
the
place
with
an
ease
that
showed
long
familiarity
with
it
she
wished
that
she
had
joined
the
club
it
made
her
feel
childish
and
immature
to
think
that
she
could
not
discuss
this
subject
with
him
as
any
one
of
those
ten
girls
could
have
done
but
it
was
one
of
the
simple
poems
to
which
the
book
opened
from
her
seat
opposite
lloyd
could
see
the
marked
margins
and
underscored
lines
as
he
read
aloud
is
the
garden
she
walked
across
arm
in
my
arm
such
a
short
while
since
down
this
side
of
the
gravel
walk
she
went
while
her
robe
edge
brushed
the
box
and
here
she
paused
in
her
gracious
talk
to
point
me
a
moth
on
the
phlox
oh
i
can
just
that
picture
cried
miss
marks
enthusiastically
i
wish
we
had
time
to
take
it
but
wait
here
a
better
one
he
added
turning
the
page
flower
she
stopped
at
finger
on
lip
stooped
over
in
doubt
as
settling
its
claim
till
she
gave
me
with
pride
to
make
no
slip
its
soft
meandering
spanish
name
what
a
name
was
it
love
or
praise
speech
or
song
i
must
learn
spanish
one
of
these
days
only
for
that
slow
sweet
name
sake
lloyd
picked
up
the
book
open
at
the
place
where
he
laid
it
face
downward
on
the
rock
i
wondah
what
flowah
browning
meant
she
said
that
had
such
a
meandering
spanish
name
speech
or
song
it
must
have
been
something
exquisitely
beautiful
or
he
would
have
been
willing
to
learn
a
language
just
for
the
sake
of
knowing
that
one
name
farther
down
the
page
were
other
underscored
lines
she
read
them
softly
almost
under
her
breath
i
find
her
not
beauties
vanish
whither
i
follow
her
beauties
flee
is
there
no
method
to
tell
her
in
spanish
june
is
twice
june
since
she
breathed
it
with
me
is
that
sweet
cried
gay
say
it
for
us
leland
say
it
in
spanish
so
we
can
hear
how
it
sounds
with
an
indulgent
smile
as
if
amused
at
her
childishness
he
lazily
did
gay
bidding
then
as
she
began
exclaiming
over
the
musical
syllables
to
alex
he
turned
to
lloyd
and
repeated
the
line
with
an
emphasis
which
made
it
altogether
personal
of
course
she
could
not
understand
it
but
the
words
were
like
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
language
of
those
dark
expressive
eyes
that
held
hers
a
moment
in
their
admiring
gaze
they
said
as
plainly
as
if
they
had
spoken
aloud
june
is
twice
june
since
breathed
it
with
me
lloyd
felt
the
colour
surge
up
into
her
face
and
to
hide
it
turned
quickly
and
began
examining
a
grass
stain
on
the
hem
of
her
skirt
with
apparent
concern
but
an
exultant
little
thrill
flashed
over
her
he
liked
her
she
was
sure
of
it
and
it
made
her
glad
so
glad
that
it
amazed
her
to
think
that
only
two
hours
before
she
had
confided
emphatically
to
a
little
black
ant
crawling
over
her
path
that
she
could
bear
him
when
she
had
finished
a
critical
examination
of
the
grass
stain
she
glanced
back
again
hoping
that
gay
had
not
seen
her
embarrassment
to
her
relief
gay
entire
attention
was
absorbed
in
an
argument
with
alex
as
to
the
exact
meaning
of
the
quotation
whether
twice
june
meant
a
lengthening
of
the
calendar
or
an
intensifying
of
its
pleasures
miss
marks
like
a
good
chaperone
could
not
have
noticed
for
she
was
busy
gathering
up
the
dishes
and
lloyd
sprang
up
to
help
her
presently
as
they
started
away
from
the
spring
leland
came
around
to
lloyd
side
you
must
let
me
teach
you
spanish
miss
sherman
he
said
in
his
masterful
way
which
seemed
to
leave
her
no
choice
in
the
matter
an
hour
a
day
would
take
much
of
your
time
and
would
be
enough
to
give
you
some
idea
of
the
charm
of
the
language
gay
tells
me
you
play
the
harp
some
of
the
songs
are
exquisite
oh
i
nevah
in
the
world
could
learn
it
i
am
suah
she
answered
lightly
with
a
shrug
that
seemed
to
indicate
the
uselessness
of
undertaking
such
a
task
you
do
know
he
answered
authoritatively
you
never
had
me
for
a
teacher
again
that
flashing
look
that
made
his
eyes
deepen
so
wonderfully
and
curved
the
cynical
lips
into
an
altogether
gentle
and
winning
smile
it
seemed
to
photograph
itself
on
lloyd
memory
recurring
to
her
again
and
again
in
the
most
unexpected
moments
she
saw
it
on
the
way
home
with
alex
all
the
time
she
was
laughingly
recounting
some
of
her
warwick
hall
escapades
it
came
between
her
and
her
book
when
she
tried
to
read
herself
to
sleep
that
afternoon
and
the
last
thing
that
night
when
her
eyes
were
closed
and
the
lights
were
out
she
saw
again
that
glance
that
said
as
plainly
as
the
slow
music
of
his
spanish
words
june
is
june
since
breathed
it
with
me
chapter
vii
spanish
lessons
the
harcourt
carriage
swung
rapidly
along
the
road
for
the
little
colonel
held
the
reins
and
was
testing
the
speed
of
the
new
horses
just
sent
down
from
lexington
is
it
glorious
she
cried
with
a
quick
glance
over
her
shoulder
at
gay
and
miss
marks
on
the
back
seat
it
like
flying
the
way
they
take
us
through
the
air
and
they
the
best
matched
team
in
the
country
leland
on
the
seat
beside
her
watched
with
growing
admiration
her
expert
handling
of
the
horses
and
gay
watched
him
swathed
in
a
white
chiffon
veil
she
was
paying
the
penalty
for
being
so
obliging
the
day
before
she
had
lain
so
long
on
the
rocks
in
her
pose
of
the
drowned
fishermaiden
that
her
face
was
burned
to
a
blister
and
she
could
not
touch
it
without
groaning
but
she
would
willingly
go
through
the
ordeal
again
she
told
herself
in
order
to
bring
about
the
present
desirable
state
of
affairs
now
which
way
asked
lloyd
as
they
came
to
a
turn
i
feel
like
a
columbus
on
an
unsailed
sea
i
thought
i
knew
every
around
heah
within
a
radius
of
five
miles
but
i
nevah
seen
any
that
fits
the
description
of
the
one
you
taking
us
to
turn
to
the
right
leland
directed
then
it
just
a
short
way
down
a
woodland
road
you
come
to
an
wicket
gate
and
a
straight
walk
leading
up
to
the
back
of
such
a
quaint
old
house
with
a
red
door
that
you
expect
to
see
a
thatched
roof
and
hear
an
english
skylark
well
of
all
things
laughed
lloyd
why
did
you
say
little
red
doah
in
the
first
place
that
would
have
located
it
for
me
simply
discovahed
the
back
premises
of
old
doctah
shelby
place
and
yoah
wondahful
english
is
their
kitchen
we
could
have
reached
their
front
gate
in
ten
minutes
from
our
house
and
heah
you
have
led
us
all
around
robin
hood
bahn
to
find
it
that
loop
around
rollington
took
us
a
good
two
miles
out
of
the
way
well
that
the
only
way
i
knew
how
to
reach
it
he
answered
with
the
flashing
smile
she
had
learned
to
look
for
i
hope
that
you
feel
that
it
has
been
time
wasted
do
not
behind
hawses
like
these
she
answered
we
forgive
you
for
the
sake
of
the
ride
i
nevah
get
tiahed
of
driving
when
i
can
go
this
fast
she
turned
into
a
narrow
lane
leading
around
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
waited
for
leland
to
open
the
gate
how
natural
everything
looks
she
exclaimed
i
have
been
heah
for
yeahs
and
when
i
was
a
little
thing
of
six
or
seven
i
used
to
be
a
weekly
visitah
i
bring
my
dawg
fritz
and
stay
from
breakfast
till
bedtime
i
called
doctah
shelby
and
his
wife
alicia
she
went
on
as
leland
resumed
his
seat
in
the
carriage
they
said
that
i
reminded
them
of
their
only
daughtah
who
was
dead
and
they
used
to
borrow
me
by
the
day
they
spoiled
me
so
that
it
was
perfectly
scandalous
the
way
i
acted
sometimes
why
did
you
stop
coming
asked
gay
shelby
had
a
fall
that
made
an
invalid
of
her
and
she
has
been
away
at
sanitariums
and
hospitals
most
of
the
time
since
i
seen
her
often
of
but
not
heah
it
only
lately
that
they
opened
up
the
house
and
come
home
to
live
places
exercised
a
strong
influence
over
lloyd
just
as
she
felt
the
challenge
of
the
in
the
avenue
at
home
and
could
not
pass
those
old
family
sentinels
without
an
unconscious
lifting
of
the
head
and
that
pride
of
bearing
which
they
seemed
to
expect
from
all
the
lloyds
so
this
old
homestead
had
its
peculiar
effect
upon
her
as
she
went
up
the
path
she
had
the
same
feeling
of
absolute
sovereignty
that
she
had
had
a
dozen
years
before
when
her
slightest
wish
was
law
in
this
adoring
household
and
where
every
act
of
hers
no
matter
how
outbreaking
passed
unchided
if
she
chose
to
empty
the
sugar
into
the
middle
of
the
garden
walk
and
fill
the
bowl
with
pebbles
aunt
alicia
took
her
afternoon
tea
unsweetened
rather
than
ring
for
more
and
thus
call
mom
beck
attention
to
the
naughtiness
of
her
little
charge
once
some
babyish
whim
prompting
her
to
order
every
picture
turned
to
the
wall
the
doctor
meekly
obeyed
and
when
some
chance
caller
remonstrated
he
protested
that
it
was
a
very
small
thing
to
do
to
give
a
child
pleasure
and
that
there
was
no
reason
why
she
should
have
them
upside
down
if
she
wished
so
strong
was
the
old
spell
now
that
as
she
stepped
up
on
the
porch
and
saw
the
same
ugly
little
chinese
idol
sitting
against
the
front
door
to
prop
it
open
that
had
sat
there
on
all
her
former
visits
she
stooped
and
stood
it
on
its
head
why
on
earth
did
you
do
that
gasped
gay
simply
of
habit
laughed
lloyd
i
used
to
hate
it
so
because
it
was
such
an
ugly
old
thing
that
i
always
stood
it
on
its
head
to
punish
it
for
staring
at
me
i
did
it
this
time
without
thinking
leland
laughed
never
in
the
short
time
he
had
known
her
had
she
seemed
quite
so
adorable
as
she
did
at
this
moment
relapsing
into
the
childish
imperiousness
of
her
little
colonel
ways
while
they
waited
for
shelby
to
come
down
he
watched
her
going
around
the
room
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
all
the
old
objects
that
had
once
held
a
fascination
for
her
she
called
his
attention
to
the
tapestry
on
the
wall
a
shepherd
and
shepherdess
beside
a
trellis
on
which
hung
roses
as
big
as
cabbages
and
told
him
the
quaint
fancies
she
had
once
had
about
the
romantic
figures
the
stuffed
birds
under
the
glass
case
on
the
mantel
each
had
a
name
she
had
given
it
she
remembered
them
all
from
the
yellow
canary
to
the
mite
of
a
poised
at
the
top
stopping
before
a
queer
old
whatnot
filled
with
and
shells
she
caught
up
a
round
china
box
a
gilt
eagle
hovering
over
a
nest
of
little
eaglets
formed
the
lid
and
her
face
began
to
dimple
as
she
lifted
the
china
bird
by
its
imposing
beak
there
ought
to
be
peppahmints
inside
she
said
there
always
used
to
be
because
i
howl
if
there
was
and
they
could
beah
to
have
me
disappointed
well
i
wish
you
look
deah
old
aunt
alicia
remembahed
all
these
yeahs
and
kept
it
ready
for
me
she
held
the
box
out
towards
him
and
he
saw
that
it
had
been
freshly
filled
with
delectable
little
striped
drops
it
hurts
my
conscience
she
said
looking
up
wistfully
as
the
familiar
odour
of
the
peppermint
greeted
her
to
think
how
i
have
neglected
her
heah
i
have
been
going
to
picnics
and
pahties
and
all
sawts
of
things
evah
since
i
came
home
from
school
and
have
nevah
been
neah
her
i
going
to
find
her
this
minute
and
not
wait
for
her
to
come
down
as
if
i
were
some
strangah
the
quaintly
furnished
old
room
straightway
lost
its
charm
for
leland
when
she
left
it
but
gay
pushing
aside
her
veil
to
taste
the
contents
of
the
eagle
nest
which
lloyd
had
deposited
in
her
lap
scrutinized
everything
with
interest
this
was
alex
home
now
and
she
wondered
how
he
would
look
in
the
midst
of
such
surroundings
she
could
imagine
him
with
such
an
antiquated
background
miss
marks
picked
up
a
basket
of
daguerreotypes
from
the
table
and
began
examining
them
they
could
hear
lloyd
calling
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
aunt
alicia
and
then
shelby
voice
tremulous
with
pleased
surprise
why
the
little
colonel
oh
my
dear
my
what
a
joy
it
is
to
have
you
here
again
then
they
heard
lloyd
laughingly
explaining
their
mission
and
after
that
they
seemed
to
pass
into
another
room
for
a
low
hum
of
voices
was
all
that
could
be
distinguished
presently
shelby
came
down
alone
she
was
a
gentle
little
old
lady
with
faded
blue
eyes
and
a
sweet
patient
face
she
wore
a
bunch
of
gray
curls
over
each
ear
in
the
fashion
of
her
girlhood
there
was
a
lingering
charm
of
youth
about
her
just
as
there
was
a
faint
suggestion
of
lavender
still
clinging
to
the
fine
old
lace
that
fell
over
her
little
hands
almost
as
soon
as
she
had
finished
welcoming
them
an
old
coloured
man
followed
her
into
the
room
bearing
a
huge
tray
with
tinkling
glasses
a
decanter
of
raspberry
shrub
and
a
plate
of
little
while
he
served
the
guests
she
explained
lloyd
delay
with
almost
girlish
eagerness
i
have
taken
a
great
liberty
with
your
model
miss
marks
but
lloyd
assured
me
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
this
last
day
of
june
is
a
very
happy
anniversary
of
mine
and
the
doctor
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
all
morning
and
when
lloyd
came
up
the
stairs
just
now
so
glowing
and
bright
it
seemed
to
me
i
saw
my
own
lost
youth
rising
up
before
me
and
i
asked
her
to
put
on
a
gown
i
have
treasured
many
years
and
be
photographed
in
that
it
is
the
one
i
had
on
when
richard
proposed
to
me
she
explained
a
faint
pink
tingeing
her
soft
old
cheeks
fifty
years
ago
in
that
same
old
garden
this
was
my
grandmother
place
then
richard
bought
it
afterwards
and
a
year
from
if
we
live
we
will
keep
our
golden
wedding
if
you
can
use
the
gown
in
the
photograph
it
will
make
me
very
happy
for
it
is
falling
to
pieces
despite
my
care
of
it
lloyd
thought
it
very
picturesque
and
appropriate
while
miss
marks
was
expressing
her
delight
over
the
privilege
for
the
unearthing
of
old
costumes
was
one
of
her
pet
diversions
lloyd
came
down
the
stairs
and
stopped
shyly
in
the
doorway
she
had
tucked
up
her
shining
hair
with
a
tall
ivory
comb
and
it
hung
in
soft
curls
on
each
side
of
her
glowing
face
in
the
old
fashion
of
shelby
girlhood
the
thin
clinging
dress
enveloped
her
like
a
pale
blue
cloud
and
a
flat
garden
hat
swung
from
her
arm
by
its
blue
ribbons
with
the
donning
of
the
ancient
dress
she
seemed
to
have
put
on
the
sweet
shy
manner
that
had
been
the
charm
of
its
first
wearer
a
oh
of
admiration
from
gay
and
miss
marks
greeted
her
appearance
and
she
turned
a
timid
glance
towards
leland
who
had
risen
quickly
his
glance
and
his
silence
were
more
eloquent
than
their
words
for
she
turned
away
blushing
now
if
i
may
have
a
bit
of
paper
to
make
a
moth
to
pin
on
the
phlox
began
miss
marks
but
shelby
stopped
her
eagerly
oh
my
dear
we
will
have
the
picture
perfect
in
every
way
richard
has
a
case
of
butterflies
and
moths
in
his
office
i
shall
send
a
servant
to
bring
it
and
to
call
him
over
for
he
will
want
to
see
lloyd
in
that
gown
i
am
sure
how
i
wish
alex
were
here
to
be
photographed
with
her
he
is
so
broad
shouldered
and
erect
he
reminds
me
daily
of
what
his
uncle
was
at
his
age
maybe
he
will
come
before
we
are
through
suggested
miss
marks
at
the
mere
thought
of
his
coming
gay
pulled
her
veil
down
hastily
over
her
blistered
face
behind
its
protecting
screen
she
watched
the
old
couple
keenly
when
the
doctor
arrived
they
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
lloyd
and
their
gaze
followed
her
tenderly
wherever
she
went
they
just
about
her
thought
gay
it
plain
to
be
seen
they
give
anything
in
the
world
to
get
her
into
the
family
i
hope
doctor
alex
wo
come
in
time
to
be
photographed
with
her
if
never
fallen
in
love
with
her
before
he
have
to
do
it
now
he
help
himself
when
she
looks
like
that
and
then
where
would
all
my
plans
be
for
poor
leland
but
leland
was
taking
care
of
his
own
interests
as
soon
as
miss
marks
had
taken
enough
plates
to
satisfy
herself
he
led
lloyd
off
to
the
end
of
the
garden
to
show
her
a
flower
which
he
had
found
with
a
soft
meandering
spanish
name
we
begin
the
lessons
he
said
as
if
it
were
all
settled
the
masterfulness
of
his
tone
had
pleased
her
the
day
before
but
here
in
the
place
where
she
had
done
all
the
dictating
and
others
had
obeyed
it
aroused
a
feeling
that
mom
beck
would
have
labelled
the
lloyd
she
did
want
to
consent
simply
because
he
had
taken
it
for
granted
that
she
would
so
she
laughingly
contradicted
him
we
begin
he
repeated
smiling
down
at
her
so
insistently
that
she
dropped
her
eyes
before
his
then
to
her
surprise
she
found
that
her
opposition
had
completely
vanished
she
felt
that
it
would
be
one
of
the
pleasantest
pastimes
that
could
be
devised
to
study
such
a
musical
language
under
such
a
teacher
but
she
had
no
intention
of
letting
him
know
how
she
felt
about
it
for
a
long
while
so
she
was
thankful
for
the
interruption
which
came
just
then
miss
marks
who
was
exploring
the
rest
of
the
premises
in
search
of
further
possibilities
sent
gay
to
summon
her
to
the
front
of
the
house
she
says
to
into
the
garden
maud
she
is
going
to
add
a
tennysonian
pose
to
her
series
of
fancies
and
she
found
a
place
where
there
a
bit
of
terrace
for
you
to
come
tripping
down
à
la
maud
to
the
tune
of
is
coming
my
own
my
sweet
catching
up
her
long
filmy
blue
skirt
lloyd
hurried
away
leaving
gay
and
leland
to
follow
as
they
chose
leland
finished
the
verse
in
a
clear
tenor
voice
as
if
singing
to
himself
but
it
followed
lloyd
down
the
walk
as
if
meant
for
her
alone
is
coming
my
own
my
sweet
were
it
ever
so
airy
a
tread
my
heart
would
hear
her
and
beat
though
earth
in
an
earthy
bed
would
start
and
tremble
under
her
feet
and
blossom
in
purple
and
red
then
he
hummed
it
almost
under
his
breath
the
entire
verse
again
forgetful
of
gay
at
his
elbow
until
she
spoke
would
kitty
have
looked
adorable
in
that
darling
old
hat
tied
under
her
chin
it
too
bad
she
could
have
been
here
to
pose
as
maud
oh
i
do
know
he
answered
absently
she
too
dark
for
the
part
miss
lloyd
looks
it
to
perfection
gay
eyes
shone
delightedly
behind
the
white
veil
and
for
a
few
steps
she
could
not
help
skipping
as
she
blessed
the
martinsville
springs
which
had
taken
kitty
off
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
her
for
a
different
fate
by
the
time
maud
picture
was
taken
alex
arrived
and
miss
marks
was
promptly
seized
with
an
inspiration
i
am
going
to
have
two
pictures
of
and
she
exclaimed
to
add
to
the
series
alex
you
take
lloyd
down
into
the
garden
again
beside
the
phlox
and
turn
so
that
i
get
your
profile
it
is
so
like
your
uncle
i
call
that
one
in
hand
when
our
life
was
then
i
take
shelby
and
the
doctor
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
a
companion
piece
and
call
that
in
hand
when
our
hair
is
they
made
a
joke
of
it
the
two
old
people
and
obligingly
took
the
places
that
lloyd
and
alex
left
but
a
mist
sprang
to
lloyd
eyes
a
moment
later
watching
the
devoted
old
couple
who
for
fifty
years
had
been
lovers
and
for
years
had
been
wed
marriage
like
that
seemed
a
beautiful
thing
she
wondered
if
such
an
experience
would
ever
be
hers
she
wished
mammy
easter
had
found
a
better
fortune
for
her
than
the
one
she
told
over
her
it
was
noon
by
the
time
the
pictures
were
all
taken
and
leland
took
miss
marks
home
in
the
carriage
while
lloyd
went
to
change
her
dress
she
wanted
gay
and
leland
to
stop
at
the
locusts
for
lunch
but
gay
refused
because
she
could
go
to
the
table
in
a
veil
and
under
the
circumstances
she
could
go
without
one
she
got
out
of
the
carriage
however
and
sat
on
the
porch
while
leland
took
the
old
colonel
for
a
short
spin
down
the
road
to
try
the
new
horses
it
been
a
mighty
nice
morning
she
said
i
wish
lucy
could
have
been
with
us
she
adores
discovering
old
places
like
that
and
doing
unexpected
things
it
almost
spoiled
my
good
times
thinking
of
the
wistful
way
she
looked
after
us
when
we
drove
off
but
she
married
exclaimed
lloyd
i
should
think
she
care
for
those
things
in
quite
the
same
way
as
she
did
before
i
should
think
she
rather
stay
with
her
husband
bosh
said
gay
being
married
does
change
a
person
disposition
and
make
tame
old
hens
out
of
lively
little
that
just
what
lucy
was
a
dear
little
always
in
a
flutter
of
doing
and
going
and
you
need
tell
me
that
she
enjoys
poking
there
at
home
with
nobody
but
jameson
as
much
as
she
would
enjoy
going
out
with
us
and
doing
things
but
he
her
husband
insisted
lloyd
as
if
that
term
covered
all
that
could
be
desired
of
human
companionship
then
she
hummed
meaningly
in
hand
when
our
life
was
may
hand
in
hand
when
our
hair
is
gray
gay
shrugged
her
shoulders
impatiently
oh
that
darby
and
joan
business
is
all
right
when
your
hair
gray
but
lucy
is
only
a
year
older
than
i
am
and
jameson
does
interest
himself
in
a
single
thing
that
she
likes
he
devoted
to
her
so
devoted
he
does
want
her
out
of
his
sight
but
it
the
kind
of
devotion
that
has
taught
me
a
lesson
if
ever
i
tie
myself
up
that
way
it
will
not
be
while
life
is
may
have
a
good
time
first
lloyd
had
no
answer
for
such
heresy
she
was
going
over
in
her
mind
the
list
of
people
from
whom
she
had
unconsciously
taken
her
exalted
impressions
of
married
life
her
mother
and
papa
jack
the
old
colonel
and
amanthis
doctor
shelby
and
aunt
alicia
rob
father
and
mother
she
felt
that
gay
was
mistaken
to
be
sure
there
were
old
and
apwall
who
quarrelled
like
cats
and
dogs
but
somehow
even
they
had
given
her
the
impression
that
they
enjoyed
their
little
encounters
and
quarrelled
to
pass
the
time
rather
than
because
they
bore
each
other
any
then
she
reflected
that
these
were
all
people
of
an
older
generation
than
lucy
and
maybe
there
was
a
difference
in
the
times
surely
gay
must
have
good
reason
for
speaking
so
feelingly
this
was
not
the
first
time
that
she
had
spoken
of
lucy
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
when
she
did
that
lloyd
recalling
mammy
easter
was
vaguely
glad
that
it
had
been
foretold
that
hers
would
be
empty
the
old
colonel
came
back
in
a
few
minutes
loud
in
his
praise
of
the
new
horses
and
to
lloyd
surprise
in
high
good
humour
with
their
owner
evidently
leland
had
improved
his
opportunity
and
had
exerted
himself
to
make
friends
with
the
old
colonel
for
to
lloyd
amazement
he
cordially
insisted
on
leland
considering
the
locusts
a
second
home
as
long
as
he
should
be
in
the
valley
and
to
come
at
any
hour
he
chose
the
would
be
out
for
him
i
shall
certainly
avail
myself
of
the
privilege
very
soon
he
responded
for
i
have
the
honour
to
begin
giving
miss
lloyd
lessons
in
spanish
so
few
young
ladies
nowadays
play
the
harp
that
when
one
has
the
ability
she
owes
it
to
the
world
to
learn
the
spanish
songs
do
you
think
so
lloyd
opened
her
mouth
to
protest
that
she
had
not
yet
given
her
consent
but
closed
it
again
as
the
old
colonel
began
expressing
his
pleasure
at
such
an
arrangement
she
felt
trapped
it
was
to
please
him
that
she
had
learned
to
play
on
her
grandmother
harp
any
reference
to
it
always
put
him
in
a
gentle
humour
she
wanted
him
to
be
cordial
and
friendly
with
leland
and
was
glad
that
he
was
no
longer
prejudiced
against
him
so
she
held
her
peace
but
it
exasperated
her
to
have
her
consent
taken
for
granted
in
such
a
way
he
had
ridden
over
her
objection
as
regardlessly
as
if
she
had
never
made
any
she
had
boasted
to
herself
he
need
put
on
any
of
his
lordly
ways
with
and
here
she
was
submitting
meekly
without
a
word
it
worried
her
after
they
had
driven
away
all
the
time
she
was
up
in
her
room
getting
ready
for
lunch
she
kept
thinking
about
it
i
just
give
him
to
undahstand
that
it
was
on
grandfathah
account
she
decided
finally
instead
of
my
influencing
him
as
gay
expected
it
looks
as
if
were
winding
around
his
fingah
but
he
is
he
i
take
the
lessons
but
i
have
no
foolishness
about
it
i
surprise
him
by
sticking
strictly
to
business
and
i
set
him
a
good
example
of
the
way
to
live
up
to
his
own
family
motto
sherman
who
made
no
objection
to
the
lessons
since
the
old
colonel
approved
of
them
so
heartily
was
on
the
front
porch
with
her
embroidery
when
leland
came
up
the
next
morning
the
first
of
july
to
give
the
first
lesson
she
smiled
to
see
how
energetically
lloyd
threw
herself
into
it
thinking
it
was
a
matter
of
pride
with
her
to
show
him
what
rapid
progress
she
could
make
it
certainly
was
a
matter
of
pride
with
the
colonel
who
enjoyed
being
waylaid
to
hear
how
beautifully
she
could
count
to
one
hundred
or
name
the
months
of
the
year
it
became
his
habit
to
take
the
book
while
perched
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
she
rattled
off
the
vocabulary
for
the
day
lesson
and
reviewed
all
the
others
that
right
that
right
he
would
say
encouragingly
at
this
rate
you
soon
be
ready
for
a
trip
to
the
alhambra
and
i
blessed
if
i
do
take
you
some
of
these
days
i
always
wanted
to
go
when
kitty
came
home
from
the
springs
lloyd
insisted
on
her
joining
the
class
but
she
declared
she
was
too
far
behind
to
attempt
catching
up
besides
she
was
in
charge
of
affairs
at
home
now
and
elise
was
to
have
a
soon
there
were
half
a
dozen
good
reasons
why
she
could
not
take
the
time
the
principal
one
which
she
did
not
give
however
was
that
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
leland
was
more
interested
in
studying
lloyd
than
in
teaching
her
a
language
and
under
such
circumstances
kitty
preferred
not
to
make
the
third
party
so
while
kitty
mornings
were
filled
with
her
housekeeping
duties
betty
with
her
writing
and
gay
with
her
music
and
plans
to
keep
lucy
occupied
it
gradually
came
about
that
leland
spent
more
and
more
of
his
time
at
the
locusts
the
lessons
lasted
only
an
hour
but
after
that
he
usually
found
some
excuse
to
stay
there
was
a
new
song
that
he
wanted
to
hear
or
a
game
of
tennis
or
a
stroll
down
to
the
sometimes
when
he
had
no
excuse
at
all
he
lingered
anyhow
lounging
on
the
shady
porch
and
talking
of
anything
that
happened
to
come
uppermost
then
at
night
he
was
often
there
again
either
because
the
locusts
was
the
gathering
place
of
the
clan
and
a
frolic
was
afoot
or
he
went
to
escort
lloyd
and
betty
to
the
cabin
or
the
beeches
to
some
entertainment
the
other
girls
had
planned
my
oh
what
a
buttahfly
i
getting
to
be
laughed
lloyd
one
evening
as
she
went
into
her
mother
room
to
have
her
dress
buttoned
a
ride
this
mawning
a
picnic
this
aftahnoon
and
now
the
rustic
dance
in
the
mallards
barn
but
nevah
mind
little
mothah
she
added
with
a
hug
as
she
caught
a
wistful
look
on
sherman
face
it
all
be
ovah
soon
this
is
the
last
summah
of
my
teens
when
i

yeahs
ago
was
lovely
will
you
evah
forget
the
way
rob
with
bisbee
it
makes
me
laugh
to
this
day
whenevah
i
think
of
it
i
suppose
rob
will
hardly
be
there
said
sherman
smiling
as
she
recalled
the
ridiculous
appearance
he
had
made
his
had
been
the
feature
of
the
evening
no
indeed
answered
lloyd
he
no
moah
likely
to
be
there
than
the
man
in
the
moon
i
wish
he
would
though
he
used
to
be
the
life
of
everything
we
saw
him
this
evening
as
we
drove
home
from
the
picnic
he
had
just
come
out
from
town
and
he
looked
so
hot
and
dusty
and
it
made
me
feel
bad
he
like
a
strangah
now
did
stop
to
speak
only
lifted
his
hat
and
turned
in
at
the
gate
at
oaklea
as
if
he
gone
on
a
thousand
drives
with
us
he
ought
to
have
been
interested
in
what
we
were
doing
for
old
times
sake
lloyd
had
not
thought
of
rob
for
days
but
she
was
reminded
of
him
many
times
that
evening
the
affair
at
the
mallards
barn
was
so
much
like
the
one
to
which
he
had
taken
her
three
years
before
the
same
old
negro
fiddlers
furnished
the
music
the
same
flickering
lantern
light
made
weird
shadows
on
the
rough
walls
and
the
same
sweet
smell
of
new
hay
filled
the
place
as
the
music
of
the
virginia
reel
began
she
thought
of
the
way
rob
had
romped
through
it
that
other
time
and
wished
she
could
see
him
once
more
as
jolly
and
as
he
was
then
why
can
one
nevah
have
two
good
times
exactly
alike
she
wondered
wistfully
she
was
standing
near
the
wide
double
doors
looking
out
across
the
fields
as
she
thought
about
it
later
recalling
how
many
things
were
alike
on
the
two
occasions
even
the
colour
of
the
dress
she
wore
she
remembered
that
because
rob
had
said
she
looked
like
an
and
it
was
rare
indeed
for
him
to
make
such
complimentary
speeches
it
was
best
for
girls
to
hear
nice
things
about
themselves
often
he
said
it
made
them
hard
to
get
along
with
too
uppity
the
music
stopped
and
leland
harcourt
came
to
find
her
she
was
looking
so
pensively
past
the
gay
scene
that
he
bent
over
her
humming
in
a
low
tone
this
dull
town
to
me
robin
adair
what
was
i
wished
to
see
what
wished
to
hear
she
started
with
a
little
laugh
blushing
slightly
because
he
seemed
to
have
read
her
thoughts
robin
adair
was
one
of
moore
old
names
for
rob
and
she
been
wishing
for
him
over
at
oaklea
rob
sat
scowling
at
a
book
spread
out
before
him
on
the
library
table
he
was
thinking
of
harcourt
as
he
had
seen
him
on
the
front
seat
beside
lloyd
in
his
white
flannels
the
very
embodiment
of
gentlemanly
leisure
no
doubt
she
noticed
the
contrast
between
them
he
all
dusty
and
dishevelled
from
his
day
work
and
the
trip
home
on
the
hot
car
not
that
he
would
change
places
not
that
he
regretted
for
an
instant
the
part
he
had
to
take
in
the
grimy
working
world
but
the
chance
encounter
had
suddenly
opened
his
eyes
to
all
that
he
had
had
to
sacrifice
for
that
work
until
now
it
had
not
even
left
him
time
to
realize
how
much
he
had
given
up
now
to
find
this
stranger
enjoying
all
that
was
once
his
stung
him
to
envy
he
smiled
grimly
as
he
recognized
it
as
envy
he
had
thought
himself
free
from
such
a
childish
trait
but
he
could
not
smile
away
the
feeling
it
persisted
till
it
accomplished
more
than
the
old
judge
advice
and
his
pleadings
that
all
work
and
no
play
was
bad
for
him
closing
his
book
he
announced
his
intention
of
walking
over
to
the
locusts
as
he
went
up
the
avenue
he
heard
the
distant
scraping
of
fiddles
and
the
rhythmic
beating
of
feet
in
the
mallard
barn
he
had
forgotten
that
it
was
the
night
of
the
rustic
dance
he
was
disappointed
at
finding
no
one
at
home
but
the
old
colonel
but
his
welcome
was
so
cordial
that
he
stayed
even
longer
than
he
had
intended
the
colonel
always
had
the
latest
news
of
every
one
but
he
had
to
talk
first
of
the
wonderful
progress
lloyd
was
making
in
spanish
and
what
a
fine
fellow
that
young
harcourt
was
did
like
the
chap
at
all
at
first
he
confided
thought
he
was
too
much
of
a
confounded
foreigner
but
i
a
big
enough
man
i
hope
to
acknowledge
a
mistake
and
i
own
up
i
was
prejudiced
when
rob
finally
rose
to
start
home
the
colonel
would
not
let
him
go
until
he
had
promised
to
come
again
the
next
night
when
lloyd
and
betty
should
be
at
home
afterwards
he
regretted
having
made
the
promise
although
he
went
early
harcourt
was
already
there
seemingly
as
much
at
home
as
if
he
were
a
member
of
the
family
it
made
rob
feel
like
a
stranger
to
see
this
newcomer
usurping
the
place
that
he
had
always
filled
in
the
sherman
household
it
grated
on
him
also
to
hear
lloyd
saying
si
señor
and
gracias
when
she
addressed
harcourt
and
grated
still
more
for
harcourt
to
turn
to
her
as
he
did
continually
with
some
aside
in
spanish
never
more
than
a
phrase
or
a
word
and
just
for
practice
they
laughingly
explained
but
it
seemed
to
emphasize
a
tie
that
had
drawn
them
together
and
rob
remoteness
he
left
early
walking
slowly
down
the
avenue
he
thought
of
the
hundreds
of
times
he
had
passed
under
those
old
on
sweet
starlighted
summer
nights
like
this
what
a
goodly
company
of
old
friends
they
were
the
kind
that
never
change
he
looked
up
vaguely
grateful
for
the
soft
lisping
of
leaves
above
him
they
seemed
to
understand
why
he
was
going
why
he
could
not
stay
down
the
avenue
he
heard
the
tinkle
of
lloyd
harp
and
then
her
voice
beginning
to
sing
the
seat
beside
the
measuring
tree
was
just
ahead
and
he
made
his
way
to
it
quietly
on
almost
that
he
might
lose
no
note
but
it
was
an
unknown
tongue
she
was
singing
a
song
that
harcourt
had
taught
her
and
rob
could
not
understand
a
word
it
was
so
symbolical
of
the
change
that
had
come
between
them
that
a
fierce
impulse
seized
him
to
rush
back
to
the
house
and
throw
the
interloper
out
of
the
window
then
he
smiled
bitterly
at
his
own
vehemence
what
right
had
he
to
be
so
savage
over
her
friendship
he
was
her
big
brother
only
and
even
that
merely
in
name
because
she
had
chosen
to
call
him
so
in
those
years
that
they
had
been
such
loyal
good
chums
it
was
little
and
mean
and
selfish
of
him
to
begrudge
her
the
slightest
thing
that
would
give
her
pleasure
this
man
with
his
fortune
his
accomplishments
his
rare
social
gifts
had
everything
to
offer
while
he
he
had
not
even
to
put
at
her
disposal
time
to
find
bypaths
to
happiness
for
her
the
sweet
clear
voice
sang
on
the
old
locusts
rustled
softly
as
the
night
wind
stirred
them
then
the
song
stopped
and
for
a
long
time
he
sat
staring
ahead
of
him
with
unseeing
eyes
at
last
he
rose
and
taking
a
step
towards
the
tree
beside
the
bench
passed
his
hand
over
the
bark
groping
for
the
notches
he
knew
were
there
but
could
not
see
he
paused
at
the
one
a
little
higher
than
his
shoulder
and
then
his
fingers
found
the
four
leaf
clover
he
had
carved
beside
it
the
last
time
lloyd
had
stood
up
to
be
measured
he
could
almost
see
her
standing
there
again
like
elaine
the
and
smiling
while
he
repeated
the
charm
of
the
four
leaf
clover
be
true
to
her
joy
draw
near
to
her
fortune
find
what
your
gifts
can
do
for
her
he
had
forgotten
how
the
lines
went
but
it
made
no
difference
anyhow
they
voiced
what
had
always
been
his
dearest
wish
for
her
and
standing
there
in
the
dark
he
vowed
savagely
that
any
man
who
stood
in
the
way
of
the
old
charm
coming
true
should
have
him
to
reckon
with
when
he
swung
off
down
the
path
taking
the
short
cut
to
oaklea
his
hat
was
pulled
grimly
down
over
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
was
set
in
a
firm
hard
line
he
did
not
open
his
books
again
that
night
lying
on
the
couch
by
his
open
window
he
watched
the
lights
at
the
locusts
shining
through
the
trees
till
the
last
one
went
out
and
he
knew
that
harcourt
had
gone
chapter
viii
shadows
of
the
world
appear
the
long
july
days
slipped
by
and
lloyd
looking
back
on
them
as
hildegarde
looked
into
her
magic
glass
saw
only
pleasant
scenes
mirrored
in
their
memory
the
fortunate
things
the
smiling
faces
the
pleasant
happenings
were
hers
and
for
a
time
even
other
troubles
those
shadows
of
the
world
that
are
always
with
us
left
her
daily
outlook
undimmed
like
hildegarde
too
she
went
on
with
her
weaving
but
wholly
unconscious
that
the
shuttle
of
her
thoughts
was
shaping
her
web
to
fit
the
shoulders
of
the
knight
who
came
oftenest
sherman
saw
it
and
was
troubled
jack
she
said
to
her
husband
one
afternoon
when
he
had
come
out
from
town
earlier
than
usual
and
they
were
wandering
around
the
shady
grounds
together
planning
some
improvements
i
afraid
those
spanish
lessons
are
a
mistake
lloyd
is
seeing
entirely
too
much
of
harcourt
he
is
here
morning
noon
and
night
sherman
gave
a
quick
glance
towards
the
tennis
court
where
the
two
were
finishing
a
lively
game
do
you
worry
elizabeth
was
his
placid
answer
it
is
as
if
she
never
been
used
to
such
devotion
she
never
known
anything
else
malcolm
and
keith
used
to
spend
fully
as
much
time
with
her
and
rob
moore
fairly
lived
over
here
yes
but
this
is
different
protested
sherman
they
were
mere
boys
and
she
dominated
them
but
leland
harcourt
is
a
man
and
an
experienced
one
socially
and
he
is
dominating
her
i
can
see
it
in
her
quick
deference
to
his
opinions
and
her
evident
desire
to
please
him
not
evident
to
him
perhaps
but
plain
enough
to
me
i
been
thinking
that
it
might
be
a
good
thing
for
us
to
go
to
the
springs
for
awhile
or
to
the
or
some
place
where
she
meet
other
people
in
a
quiet
little
country
place
like
this
a
man
like
leland
harcourt
looms
up
big
on
a
young
girl
horizon
a
girl
just
out
of
school
eager
for
new
interests
it
is
wise
in
us
to
allow
her
to
be
restricted
just
to
his
society
when
we
could
so
easily
give
her
the
of
contrasts
sherman
looked
down
at
his
wife
with
an
indulgent
smile
do
you
worry
he
repeated
lloyd
will
do
a
lot
of
romantic
probably
but
she
has
my
and
i
have
her
promise
but
jack
i
verily
believe
the
child
thinks
he
measures
up
to
all
your
requirements
and
really
there
is
nothing
one
can
urge
against
his
character
it
more
a
matter
of
temperament
i
am
sure
she
could
be
happy
with
him
she
just
at
the
romantic
age
now
to
be
very
much
impressed
with
that
kind
of
a
man
if
she
were
older
she
would
see
his
shallowness
his
lack
of
purpose
his
intense
selfishness
i
do
think
that
we
ought
to
shut
our
eyes
to
the
possible
outcome
of
this
constant
companionship
we
are
allowing
well
he
answered
hesitatingly
slow
to
acknowledge
his
distrust
of
lloyd
judgment
yet
quick
to
see
the
wisdom
of
her
point
of
view
maybe
you
are
right
but
he
added
wistfully
i
had
hoped
to
keep
her
home
this
summer
she
has
been
away
at
school
so
long
and
she
be
in
town
so
much
next
winter
if
she
makes
her
début
wait
till
i
have
had
a
talk
with
her
before
you
plan
any
trips
but
do
you
see
urged
sherman
it
is
something
too
intangible
to
discuss
to
speak
to
her
about
it
now
to
make
any
opposition
to
him
at
all
may
quicken
her
interest
in
him
and
make
her
champion
his
cause
that
would
be
fatal
and
yet
it
just
as
dangerous
to
wait
love
at
that
age
is
like
a
fog
it
comes
creeping
up
so
gradually
that
you
do
realize
what
is
enveloping
you
till
completely
lost
in
it
and
all
the
rest
of
the
world
shut
out
you
speak
from
experience
he
said
teasingly
you
know
very
well
she
confessed
laughingly
what
a
befogged
state
was
in
all
papa
breathing
out
of
and
did
make
the
slightest
difference
i
was
blind
and
deaf
to
everything
but
you
and
i
want
lloyd
to
be
the
same
she
added
hastily
if
you
were
as
unreasonable
as
papa
was
then
but
the
circumstances
are
too
different
to
be
compared
i
simply
warning
you
that
the
little
colonel
name
was
not
lightly
given
she
has
not
only
all
my
determination
in
her
makeup
but
her
grandfather
as
well
here
the
gardener
met
them
and
the
conversation
dropped
the
next
half
hour
was
spent
in
consultation
over
some
changes
to
be
made
in
the
conservatory
when
they
went
back
to
the
house
leland
harcourt
had
gone
and
lloyd
was
just
stepping
into
doctor
shelby
buggy
which
was
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
house
the
old
doctor
waited
for
them
to
come
within
hearing
distance
before
he
leaned
out
and
called
i
just
borrowing
the
little
colonel
for
awhile
there
a
case
over
at
rollington
that
needs
the
attention
of
her
king
daughters
circle
and
i
taking
her
over
to
investigate
it
we
be
home
before
dark
all
right
called
sherman
waving
his
hat
as
lloyd
looked
back
at
them
with
a
smile
and
a
flutter
of
her
handkerchief
during
the
winter
that
lloyd
had
joined
the
circle
and
in
the
summer
vacations
following
it
had
been
a
matter
of
frequent
occurrence
for
the
old
doctor
to
take
her
with
him
on
such
errands
remembering
how
interested
lloyd
had
become
in
many
of
the
cases
sherman
breathed
a
sigh
of
thankfulness
hoping
that
this
might
prove
to
be
one
that
would
enlist
her
sympathies
and
occupy
so
much
of
her
time
that
it
would
make
a
serious
break
in
the
spanish
lessons
it
had
been
a
happy
afternoon
for
lloyd
if
she
had
stopped
and
tried
to
recall
what
made
it
so
she
could
not
have
mentioned
any
particular
thing
to
be
young
and
well
and
filled
with
the
same
glow
that
made
the
summer
day
a
joy
was
enough
but
to
feel
that
some
one
whose
opinion
she
valued
very
much
found
her
charming
and
said
so
with
every
glance
of
his
dark
eyes
was
more
than
enough
it
made
her
cup
of
happiness
complete
and
brimmed
it
over
the
doctor
was
pouring
out
a
tale
of
somebody
woes
but
the
trace
of
a
smile
lingered
on
her
lips
as
she
made
a
polite
attempt
to
listen
she
could
not
quite
shut
out
the
thought
of
that
last
game
of
tennis
and
the
trivial
pleasantries
that
had
gone
to
make
up
the
sum
of
her
great
content
there
was
a
dreamy
look
in
her
eyes
as
she
listened
the
spanish
serenade
that
leland
harcourt
had
sung
before
he
left
kept
repeating
itself
over
and
over
a
sort
of
undercurrent
to
what
the
doctor
was
saying
she
beat
time
to
it
with
her
on
the
side
of
the
buggy
once
it
rose
so
insistently
that
she
lost
what
the
doctor
was
saying
and
came
to
herself
with
a
start
when
a
familiar
name
arrested
her
attention
ned
bannon
wife
she
repeated
in
astonishment
you
suahly
mean
that
it
ida
shane
who
sick
ovah
in
that
tumbledown
cottage
of
the
mccarty
i
surely
do
he
answered
she
did
want
to
come
back
to
this
part
of
the
country
goodness
knows
she
remembers
what
a
commotion
it
raised
when
she
eloped
from
the
seminary
with
ned
five
years
ago
but
ned
has
scarcely
drawn
a
sober
breath
for
the
last
year
she
sure
of
getting
needlework
here
and
with
little
wardo
to
consider
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
put
her
pride
in
her
pocket
and
come
little
wardo
breathed
lloyd
wonderingly
the
ride
seemed
full
of
surprises
yes
she
has
a
little
son
about
four
years
old
i
judge
and
it
is
on
his
account
that
i
have
asked
the
help
of
the
king
daughters
have
to
be
taken
away
from
her
till
she
better
for
she
is
morbidly
sensitive
about
keeping
ned
failings
from
him
she
has
never
allowed
him
to
find
out
that
his
father
is
a
drunkard
she
makes
a
hero
of
him
to
the
little
fellow
seems
to
think
that
he
blame
her
for
giving
him
such
a
father
by
marrying
a
man
whom
she
had
been
warned
would
bring
her
nothing
but
trouble
and
disgrace
she
desperately
ill
and
of
course
in
her
weak
condition
she
magnifies
the
matter
it
has
become
a
mania
with
her
poah
violet
exclaimed
lloyd
in
distress
her
thoughts
flying
back
to
the
scene
in
the
school
orchard
five
years
ago
when
watching
the
glimmer
of
the
pearl
on
ida
white
hand
in
the
moonlight
she
had
been
thrilled
by
her
whisper
he
says
that
what
my
life
means
to
him
a
pearl
and
that
my
influence
can
make
him
the
man
i
want
him
to
be
oh
princess
i
give
my
life
to
keep
him
straight
not
even
an
echo
of
the
serenade
was
in
her
memory
now
her
knowledge
of
ida
nearness
seemed
to
bring
her
old
actually
before
her
the
faint
odour
of
violets
the
shy
glance
of
her
appealing
violet
eyes
under
the
long
lashes
the
bewitching
dimple
at
the
corner
of
her
mouth
the
flash
of
her
rings
the
sweep
of
her
long
skirts
the
soft
hair
gleaming
under
the
picture
hat
more
than
all
the
air
of
romance
and
mystery
that
surrounded
her
because
of
the
pearl
and
the
secret
engagement
to
her
edwardo
i
had
intended
for
her
to
see
you
said
the
doctor
when
her
exclamations
and
questions
revealed
to
him
the
intimacy
that
had
once
existed
between
them
but
under
the
circumstances
it
will
be
the
best
thing
i
can
do
i
go
in
first
and
prepare
her
for
the
meeting
however
she
thinks
she
has
a
friend
left
on
earth
on
account
of
her
unhappy
marriage
everybody
warned
her
against
it
the
front
door
stood
open
and
lloyd
sat
down
on
the
broken
step
to
wait
it
seemed
impossible
that
she
was
going
to
find
ida
the
embodiment
of
daintiness
and
refinement
in
this
dilapidated
old
place
the
whitewash
had
long
ago
dropped
in
scales
from
the
rough
walls
the
were
broken
the
shutters
sagging
half
the
pickets
off
the
fence
not
a
spear
of
grass
ventured
up
in
the
barren
yard
where
a
rank
unpruned
struggled
for
its
life
in
the
baked
earth
the
house
stood
so
near
the
road
that
the
thick
summer
dust
rolled
in
suffocatingly
whenever
a
vehicle
passed
how
can
people
exist
in
such
an
awful
desolate
forsaken
spot
she
wondered
looking
around
with
a
shudder
of
disgust
that
ida
dainty
ida
who
scorned
everything
that
was
common
and
coarse
should
be
lying
inside
in
that
dark
room
was
more
than
she
could
believe
a
wagon
rattled
by
and
she
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
face
stifled
by
the
cloud
of
dust
that
rose
in
its
wake
when
she
ventured
to
take
it
down
again
and
draw
a
long
breath
a
chubby
barefooted
child
was
standing
in
the
path
in
front
of
her
regarding
her
curiously
the
wagon
made
so
much
noise
that
she
had
not
heard
his
bare
feet
pattering
around
the
house
she
gave
a
little
start
of
surprise
then
smiled
at
him
for
he
was
an
attractive
little
fellow
despite
the
fact
that
his
face
was
smeared
with
the
remains
of
the
bread
and
jam
he
had
just
been
enjoying
at
one
of
the
neighbours
and
his
gingham
apron
was
in
rags
he
had
caught
it
on
the
barb
wire
fence
as
he
climbed
through
as
he
smiled
back
at
her
shyly
from
under
his
long
lashes
interest
quickened
for
there
was
no
mistaking
the
likeness
of
those
violet
eyes
and
the
dimple
that
came
at
the
corner
of
his
cupid
bow
of
a
mouth
they
were
so
like
ida
that
she
smiled
and
said
confidently
you
wardo
are
you
he
nodded
gravely
then
after
another
long
silent
scrutiny
turned
away
to
pour
the
sand
out
of
the
old
tin
can
he
was
carrying
in
a
pile
under
the
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
jam
and
the
dirt
lloyd
would
have
caught
him
up
and
kissed
him
he
was
such
a
dear
little
thing
with
a
thatch
of
short
golden
curls
but
her
fastidious
dislike
of
touching
anything
dirty
made
her
draw
back
it
was
well
for
the
furtherance
of
their
acquaintance
that
she
did
so
he
was
not
accustomed
to
caresses
from
strangers
he
accepted
her
presence
on
the
without
question
and
presently
as
the
moments
passed
and
she
made
no
movement
towards
him
he
went
up
to
her
with
friendly
curiosity
is
you
got
a
to
your
house
he
asked
no
she
confessed
feeling
that
he
would
consider
her
lacking
on
that
account
and
that
she
must
hasten
to
mention
other
attractions
but
i
have
a
red
and
green
bird
that
can
talk
and
a
little
black
pony
named
it
so
little
that
there
nobody
at
my
house
now
small
enough
to
ride
it
so
it
stays
all
day
long
in
the
field
and
eats
grass
i
little
enough
to
ride
it
he
began
confidently
just
then
the
doctor
came
out
and
she
sprang
up
her
heart
throbbing
i
going
now
for
the
nurse
he
said
in
a
low
tone
she
due
on
the
next
train
keep
her
as
quiet
as
possible
of
course
you
have
to
let
her
free
her
mind
but
promise
her
almost
anything
to
soothe
her
be
back
in
quarter
of
an
hour
frightened
at
being
left
alone
with
such
a
weight
of
responsibility
thrust
upon
her
lloyd
tiptoed
into
the
house
in
the
dim
light
she
almost
stumbled
over
the
cot
on
which
ned
bannon
lay
in
a
drunken
stupor
and
her
first
glance
at
the
bed
beyond
made
her
draw
back
in
dismay
she
never
would
have
recognized
the
white
face
on
the
pillow
as
ida
had
it
not
been
for
the
appealing
eyes
turned
towards
her
five
years
of
poverty
and
illness
and
neglect
had
changed
the
pretty
little
into
a
faded
woman
she
had
been
crying
ever
since
she
was
taken
sick
and
now
was
so
weak
and
hysterical
that
she
caught
at
lloyd
with
a
cry
and
clung
to
her
sobbing
oh
it
kills
me
to
have
you
find
me
this
way
she
gasped
when
tried
so
long
to
hide
what
we
come
to
but
i
glad
you
come
for
the
baby
sake
oh
lloyd
what
going
to
become
of
my
little
wardo
it
was
several
minutes
before
she
could
talk
coherently
and
then
she
began
to
sob
out
the
story
of
her
married
life
her
miserable
failure
to
reform
ned
lloyd
tried
to
stop
her
presently
thinking
she
was
becoming
delirious
but
she
might
as
well
have
tried
to
stop
a
high
tide
oh
i
have
been
so
proud
she
sobbed
i
could
tell
anybody
i
could
tell
you
now
if
i
was
afraid
that
i
might
die
like
that
poor
woman
across
the
street
last
night
she
left
five
little
children
but
i
ca
leave
my
little
wardo
like
that
she
broke
out
desperately
i
he
has
inherited
ned
awful
appetite
i
must
stay
and
help
him
fight
it
it
all
my
i
gave
him
such
a
father
a
father
that
he
can
never
be
proud
of
a
father
that
will
be
only
a
disgrace
to
him
oh
why
did
somebody
warn
me
that
it
was
not
only
a
husband
i
was
choosing
but
my
little
wardo
father
nobody
ever
told
me
and
i
was
so
young
i
never
thought
of
any
one
but
myself
and
now
the
poor
little
innocent
soul
will
have
to
suffer
for
it
all
his
life
long
she
was
throwing
herself
about
so
wildly
that
lloyd
was
frightened
and
rose
from
her
chair
to
call
one
of
the
neighbours
but
she
could
not
break
away
ida
caught
at
her
dress
and
held
her
fast
in
her
frenzied
clasp
but
i
tell
you
i
wo
let
him
grow
up
to
be
like
that
she
cried
with
her
eyes
glaring
wildly
at
the
drunken
man
on
the
cot
across
the
room
i
kill
him
with
my
own
hands
first
while
he
is
little
and
good
god
would
understand
would
he
he
could
blame
me
for
trying
to
save
my
baby
but
if
he
did
i
have
to
do
it
anyway
i
have
to
do
it
and
take
the
punishment
i
ca
have
my
little
wardo
grow
up
to
be
like
the
sound
of
his
name
brought
the
child
to
the
door
he
came
pattering
in
and
climbing
up
on
the
bed
beside
his
mother
stroked
her
face
with
his
dirty
little
dimpled
hand
the
soft
touch
quieted
ida
in
an
instant
and
with
an
effort
to
speak
calmly
she
looked
up
at
lloyd
the
doctor
said
the
baby
must
go
away
for
awhile
for
fear
of
the
fever
but
i
ca
give
him
up
to
just
anybody
lloyd
the
neighbours
have
been
good
and
kind
but
i
afraid
he
might
find
out
from
some
of
the
children
about
ned
you
know
but
with
you
oh
lloyd
would
it
be
asking
too
much
if
she
stopped
with
her
question
half
uttered
but
the
imploring
look
in
her
eyes
was
a
prayer
that
lloyd
could
not
resist
and
she
held
out
her
arms
toward
the
little
figure
cuddled
up
on
the
bed
i
take
him
till
you
better
she
promised
impulsively
the
tears
welled
up
in
ida
eyes
again
she
was
so
weak
the
least
thing
started
them
he
never
been
away
from
me
a
single
night
in
his
life
she
said
brokenly
i
could
give
him
up
to
anybody
but
you
then
seeing
the
frightened
look
that
crept
into
the
child
face
as
he
listened
to
the
conversation
which
he
but
half
understood
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
smiled
at
him
tremulously
dear
little
son
you
want
to
help
mother
get
well
do
you
lamb
then
go
with
mother
dearest
friend
for
awhile
she
take
care
of
you
while
the
good
doctor
makes
me
well
and
she
tell
you
stories
and
make
you
have
such
a
happy
time
and
let
you
ride
on
the
black
pony
broke
in
lloyd
eagerly
anxious
to
clear
away
the
troubled
pucker
on
the
child
face
that
came
at
mention
of
a
separation
an
hear
the
wed
and
gween
bird
talk
he
added
himself
his
face
lighting
up
at
the
thought
then
he
laid
his
plump
little
hand
on
hot
cheek
to
compel
her
attention
it
was
a
gesture
she
loved
and
she
kissed
his
fingers
passionately
as
he
said
with
an
eager
voice
she
has
a
bird
that
can
talk
i
go
and
hear
what
it
says
an
i
come
back
an
tell
you
evidently
his
idea
of
separation
was
based
on
the
length
of
the
neighbourhood
visits
he
had
made
and
he
accepted
lloyd
invitation
willingly
expecting
a
speedy
return
let
go
wite
away
fwend
he
exclaimed
wriggling
down
off
the
bed
i
get
my
hat
if
anything
had
been
needed
to
complete
lloyd
surrender
to
the
little
fellow
charms
it
was
the
sweet
way
in
which
he
gave
her
the
title
dearest
friend
that
was
what
his
mother
had
called
her
and
he
thought
it
was
her
name
she
caught
him
up
and
kissed
him
despite
the
jam
streaks
and
the
dirt
come
on
and
have
yoah
face
washed
and
yoah
curls
brushed
so
we
be
all
ready
when
the
buggy
comes
back
she
said
hurrying
to
make
him
presentable
before
his
mood
could
change
as
she
gathered
his
clothes
together
and
packed
them
for
the
short
journey
in
a
dress
box
which
she
found
under
the
bed
it
made
an
ache
grip
her
throat
to
see
how
ida
had
thrown
the
shield
of
her
around
him
in
every
way
possible
there
was
no
mark
of
poverty
here
she
had
cut
up
her
own
clothes
relics
of
a
happier
time
to
make
the
little
linen
suits
that
were
so
pretty
and
becoming
no
child
in
the
valley
was
better
clad
or
looked
so
much
like
a
little
aristocrat
as
long
as
she
was
able
to
give
him
her
daily
attention
he
was
so
accustomed
to
being
washed
and
brushed
and
dressed
that
he
made
no
objection
to
what
most
children
of
that
age
consider
an
unnecessary
process
and
when
lloyd
went
about
it
with
unpractised
fingers
he
gravely
corrected
her
mistakes
and
laughed
when
she
made
a
play
of
the
buttonholes
being
hungry
mouths
that
swallowed
the
buttons
in
a
hurry
never
in
her
life
had
she
exerted
herself
so
much
to
be
entertaining
for
she
wanted
to
take
him
away
without
a
scene
she
wanted
too
for
him
to
look
his
best
that
he
might
win
his
own
way
at
the
locusts
she
thought
with
a
trifle
of
uneasiness
that
her
impulsive
act
might
not
meet
her
family
entire
approval
ida
separation
from
him
was
a
painful
one
for
she
realized
her
condition
and
knew
that
it
was
possible
that
this
might
be
her
last
sight
of
him
as
lloyd
turned
away
with
her
parting
cry
ringing
in
her
ears
oh
be
good
to
him
be
good
to
him
a
great
tenderness
sprang
up
in
her
heart
for
the
child
who
put
his
hand
in
hers
so
trustingly
and
trotted
away
beside
her
obediently
at
his
mother
bidding
at
the
cot
he
stopped
to
clamber
up
and
kiss
the
red
face
burrowed
down
in
the
pillows
in
a
sodden
sleep
my
poor
farvah
sick
too
he
explained
looking
up
at
her
as
if
bespeaking
sympathy
for
him
also
once
in
the
buggy
while
they
waited
for
the
doctor
to
unfasten
the
he
reached
up
and
put
his
hand
on
her
cheek
in
his
baby
fashion
to
ask
her
a
question
the
touch
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
it
was
so
confiding
and
she
was
still
so
shaken
by
the
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
in
a
great
throb
of
tenderness
for
the
helpless
little
body
given
over
to
her
care
she
drew
him
closer
with
a
hasty
kiss
on
the
top
of
his
curly
head
fwend
he
said
smiling
up
at
her
as
if
he
understood
the
reason
of
her
sudden
caress
then
he
cuddled
his
head
against
her
shoulder
in
a
satisfied
way
saying
tell
me
again
what
the
wed
and
gween
bird
says
as
they
drove
in
at
the
entrance
gate
to
the
locusts
lloyd
recalled
an
experience
she
had
not
thought
of
in
years
an
autumn
day
when
only
a
baby
herself
not
yet
six
she
had
been
left
to
make
her
way
alone
up
this
same
avenue
she
had
never
spent
a
night
away
from
her
mother
and
she
was
to
stay
a
week
alone
with
her
grandfather
who
did
not
know
how
to
sing
her
to
sleep
and
kiss
her
down
so
she
would
be
afraid
of
the
black
shadows
in
the
corners
here
by
this
very
gate
she
had
stood
assailed
by
such
a
great
ache
of
loneliness
and
homesickness
that
she
was
sure
she
would
die
if
she
had
to
endure
it
another
moment
and
there
was
the
spot
where
rustling
around
in
the
dead
leaves
fritz
had
found
the
little
gray
glove
her
mother
had
dropped
when
she
stooped
to
kiss
her
as
she
remembered
how
she
had
carried
that
glove
all
week
rolled
up
in
a
little
wad
in
her
pocket
to
help
her
to
be
good
and
not
to
cry
she
resolved
that
wardo
should
not
have
the
same
experience
if
any
effort
of
hers
could
prevent
it
she
would
devote
her
time
to
him
night
and
day
and
keep
him
so
happily
employed
there
would
be
no
time
for
the
sorry
feelin
that
had
been
her
childish
undoing
there
was
no
care
or
accustomed
tenderness
he
should
miss
it
was
nearly
dark
when
she
reached
home
and
so
afraid
was
she
that
the
nightfall
itself
would
make
wardo
homesick
that
she
began
to
provide
for
his
entertainment
even
before
she
made
any
explanation
to
her
astonished
family
illustration
for
once
the
red
and
green
bird
was
on
its
good
behaviour
oh
papa
jack
she
called
please
find
the
parrot
right
away
for
wardo
to
see
then
i
explain
everything
for
once
the
red
and
green
bird
was
on
its
good
behaviour
and
began
to
show
off
as
soon
as
it
was
brought
to
the
front
while
wardo
watched
it
and
absorbed
lloyd
gave
an
excited
and
tearful
account
of
her
visit
to
ida
the
old
colonel
said
something
about
the
fever
and
the
danger
of
infection
but
when
she
had
finished
her
story
nobody
else
had
the
heart
to
show
displeasure
at
what
she
had
done
and
i
wo
let
him
be
a
trouble
to
anybody
she
added
i
take
care
of
him
every
bit
myself
and
keep
him
out
of
the
way
as
sherman
watched
her
leading
the
child
talking
to
him
at
every
step
to
keep
his
thoughts
diverted
from
home
and
then
heard
her
giving
orders
to
walker
about
her
old
high
chair
and
little
white
crib
to
be
brought
down
from
the
attic
she
turned
to
sherman
with
a
sigh
of
relief
she
found
her
own
antidote
for
the
spanish
lessons
jack
we
have
to
go
away
to
the
springs
or
the
mountains
now
i
sure
chapter
ix
more
shadows
from
that
first
night
wardo
had
the
entire
household
at
his
feet
lloyd
scarcely
touched
her
own
dinner
in
her
anxiety
to
anticipate
his
wants
he
was
very
near
tears
sometimes
when
his
furtive
glances
around
the
table
showed
only
strange
faces
but
he
was
a
game
little
chap
as
the
colonel
said
and
a
credit
to
whoever
had
taught
him
his
manners
he
could
not
be
induced
to
speak
save
in
whispers
when
lloyd
put
a
protecting
arm
around
the
high
chair
where
he
sat
and
with
an
indulgent
smile
leaned
over
with
her
ear
almost
touching
his
lips
before
the
dinner
was
over
he
fell
asleep
worn
out
by
the
unusual
excitement
of
the
day
his
curly
head
laid
confidingly
on
fwend
shoulder
sh
whispered
lloyd
warningly
to
the
coloured
man
who
came
in
to
change
the
plates
for
dessert
wait
a
minute
carry
him
first
please
papa
jack
if
i
can
get
him
undressed
without
waking
him

miss
one
homesick
crying
spell
anyhow
leland
harcourt
came
just
as
she
had
accomplished
the
task
and
betty
tiptoed
into
the
room
to
tell
her
lloyd
looked
down
at
the
little
figure
in
the
crib
and
shook
her
head
as
it
stirred
restlessly
i
stay
with
him
offered
betty
no
i
must
wait
till
i
suah

asleep

explain
to
mistah

awhile
oh
betty
is
he
a
darling
it
going
to
be
moah
fun
taking
care
of
him
than
dressing
dolls
used
to
be
it
was
so
much
fun
next
morning
however
when
he
cried
to
be
taken
to
his
mother
every
sob
that
shook
the
little
shoulders
tore
heart
also
for
remembering
the
violence
of
her
own
childish
grieving
she
put
herself
into
wardo
place
so
completely
that
she
cried
too
then
everybody
in
the
house
rose
to
the
occasion
papa
jack
brought
out
tarbaby
and
walked
him
up
and
down
the
avenue
as
long
as
wardo
was
pleased
to
sit
in
the
saddle
sherman
took
him
to
the
stables
to
see
half
a
dozen
gray
kittens
that
had
made
their
home
in
the
hay
and
walker
carried
him
to
look
at
the
calves
after
that
the
old
colonel
unsheathed
his
sword
and
got
out
his
spurs
and
started
to
tell
the
bloodiest
battle
tales
he
knew
and
when
they
did
not
meet
with
the
approval
he
expected
he
actually
invented
a
game
of
bear
which
they
played
in
his
den
they
played
it
till
wardo
began
shrieking
with
thrills
of
real
fear
at
the
fearsome
growling
and
the
big
fur
gloves
thrust
at
him
from
behind
the
leather
couch
he
grew
so
nervous
and
excited
that
the
colonel
was
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
calm
the
whirlwind
he
had
unintentionally
stirred
up
it
was
betty
who
came
to
the
rescue
she
led
him
down
to
the
orchard
and
taking
him
on
her
lap
in
the
old
swing
swung
him
so
high
up
into
the
top
of
the
that
they
could
look
over
and
see
the
eggs
in
a
nest
then
little
by
little
she
stopped
their
swinging
till
presently
they
were
swaying
very
gently
back
and
forth
near
the
ground
and
she
had
charmed
him
into
quietness
with
one
of
the
old
tales
that
she
used
to
tell
davy
about
the
elves
who
live
in
the
buttercups
and
ride
far
miles
on
the
bumblebees
glancing
up
towards
the
house
she
saw
leland
harcourt
mounting
the
steps
it
was
the
hour
for
lloyd
lesson
so
although
she
had
intended
to
spend
the
morning
outlining
a
magazine
story
which
she
had
in
mind
she
took
a
fresh
grip
on
the
swing
rope
and
began
another
tale
that
was
the
way
wardo
entertainment
went
on
for
the
next
few
days
he
was
not
allowed
an
idle
moment
in
which
to
think
of
going
home
so
what
with
all
these
amusements
and
the
novelty
of
constant
attention
from
his
elders
it
was
not
long
before
he
developed
into
a
veritable
little
tyrant
demanding
attention
every
moment
of
his
waking
hours
but
when
her
unremitting
service
grew
irksome
lloyd
had
only
to
think
of
ida
tossing
helpless
and
delirious
at
the
mercy
of
the
wasting
fever
her
daily
visits
to
the
cottage
kept
her
in
full
realization
of
the
seriousness
of
the
case
and
a
deeper
feeling
of
tenderness
swept
over
her
whenever
she
came
back
to
wardo
after
one
of
these
visits
for
each
time
she
knew
that
the
dreaded
crisis
was
nearer
and
she
could
not
bear
to
think
of
his
being
left
motherless
it
will
just
kill
him
she
thought
with
tears
in
her
eyes
as
she
watched
the
pitiful
quivering
of
his
mouth
and
the
manly
attempt
to
choke
back
his
sobs
whenever
ida
name
was
mentioned
so
to
make
sure
that
he
was
happily
employed
she
took
him
wherever
she
went
except
on
that
one
short
drive
which
she
made
daily
to
rollington
when
she
and
betty
spent
the
day
at
the
beeches
or
the
cabin
he
was
one
of
the
party
when
miss
marks
had
another
expedition
to
finish
her
garden
fancies
he
was
included
in
the
group
and
a
charming
picture
he
made
as
with
a
butterfly
net
in
his
hand
he
stooped
to
point
to
the
figures
on
the
old
that
marked
the
flight
of
the
happy
summer
it
was
from
this
expedition
that
they
drove
back
one
evening
in
the
early
august
twilight
he
had
been
asleep
most
of
the
way
home
but
roused
up
as
the
carriage
turned
in
at
the
gate
betty
leaning
forward
in
her
seat
drew
a
long
breath
oh
smell
the
lilies
she
exclaimed
looking
across
the
lawn
to
where
they
stood
like
tall
white
ghosts
in
the
twilight
how
heavenly
sweet
such
a
delicious
ending
to
such
a
nice
day
do
you
know
lloyd
been
feeling
all
the
way
home
as
if
i
were
going
to
hear
from
my
book
the
publishers
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
read
it
since
i
sent
it
i
feel
it
in
my
bones
that
there
be
a
letter
waiting
for
me
do
you
feel
fings
wif
your
bones
betty
asked
wardo
sleepily
raising
his
curly
head
from
lloyd
shoulder
oh
i
could
make
you
understand
she
answered
it
just
a
sort
of
happy
flutter
all
through
you
that
tells
you
something
nice
is
going
to
happen
what
flutter
asked
the
tireless
questioner
but
betty
paid
no
heed
the
carriage
had
reached
the
steps
and
with
a
spring
she
was
out
calling
eagerly
as
she
stepped
into
the
broad
path
of
light
streaming
across
the
porch
from
the
hall
door
any
mail
for
me
godmother
nothing
but
a
package
answered
sherman
coming
out
to
meet
them
and
it
will
keep
better
run
on
in
and
eat
your
dinner
first
cindy
has
been
keeping
it
hot
for
you
all
but
betty
could
not
wait
as
she
darted
into
the
hall
sherman
turned
to
lloyd
who
was
half
dragging
half
lifting
the
sleepy
wardo
up
the
steps
poor
little
girl
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
wanted
to
put
off
her
disappointment
as
long
as
possible
and
not
spoil
her
happy
day
with
such
an
ending
her
manuscript
has
come
back
from
the
publishers
oh
mothah
exclaimed
lloyd
in
distress
you
do
mean
that
refused
it
they
suahly
could
have
done
maybe
they
just
sent
it
back
for
her
to
make
some
changes
in
it
betty
voice
in
the
door
stopped
her
as
long
as
she
lived
lloyd
never
again
smelled
the
odour
of
august
lilies
when
they
were
heavy
with
dew
that
she
did
not
see
the
tragic
misery
of
betty
white
face
as
it
appeared
that
moment
in
the
light
of
the
hall
lamp
they
sent
it
back
godmother
she
said
in
a
low
even
tone
it
was
good
enough
it
all
a
miserable
mistake
to
think
that
i
can
write
for
i
put
the
very
best
of
myself
into
this
and
it
is
a
failure
no
no
began
lloyd
but
betty
would
not
wait
for
any
attempted
comfort
i
do
want
any
dinner
she
said
then
with
her
mouth
twitching
piteously
as
she
fought
back
the
tears
she
ran
and
they
heard
the
door
close
and
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
nobody
ever
knew
what
went
on
behind
that
locked
door
for
betty
was
as
quiet
in
her
griefs
as
she
was
in
her
joy
and
made
no
audible
moan
she
threw
herself
across
the
foot
of
the
bed
and
lay
there
staring
out
of
the
window
in
the
hopelessness
of
utter
defeat
the
katydids
shrilling
in
the
locusts
seemed
to
fill
the
night
with
an
unbearable
discord
she
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
to
shut
out
the
hateful
sound
it
seemed
to
her
that
nothing
mattered
any
more
as
she
slowly
recalled
all
her
months
of
painstaking
work
the
keen
pleasure
that
each
hour
of
it
had
afforded
her
was
turned
into
bitterness
by
the
thought
that
it
had
proved
a
failure
only
once
before
had
she
felt
such
hopelessness
that
was
at
the
first
when
she
thought
she
was
doomed
to
be
blind
they
had
brought
her
the
newspaper
containing
her
first
published
poem
it
was
called
night
and
as
they
guided
her
finger
over
the
page
that
it
might
rest
proudly
on
the
place
where
her
name
was
printed
she
had
faltered
it
going
to
be
such
a
long
night
and
there
are
no
stars
in
this
one
now
the
outlook
seemed
even
more
hopeless
bereft
of
the
star
of
her
great
hope
the
ambition
to
be
an
author
had
been
a
part
of
her
so
long
that
it
seemed
even
more
indispensable
than
her
the
slow
hot
tears
began
to
drop
down
on
her
pillow
after
awhile
tears
of
mortification
as
well
as
disappointment
the
girls
would
have
to
know
she
had
been
foolish
to
make
such
a
parade
of
her
attempt
she
should
have
waited
but
then
she
had
been
so
that
her
story
was
a
good
one
that
was
the
hardest
part
to
bear
that
she
had
been
so
mistaken
it
would
have
been
easier
she
thought
bitterly
if
her
rebuffs
had
come
earlier
if
some
of
her
first
contributions
had
been
returned
but
the
way
had
been
made
so
easy
for
her
her
very
first
poems
had
been
accepted
printed
praised
everybody
had
predicted
success
everybody
expected
great
things
of
her
even
old
bishop
chartley
the
girls
at
school
had
openly
proclaimed
her
as
a
genius
the
teachers
had
praised
every
effort
and
urged
her
to
greater
the
whole
valley
looked
upon
her
as
one
set
apart
by
a
special
gift
was
it
any
wonder
she
asked
herself
that
she
had
come
to
believe
in
her
own
ability
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
urged
down
a
flowery
path
by
each
one
she
met
to
find
that
every
guide
was
mistaken
and
that
the
way
they
pointed
out
ended
in
a
dismal
slough
of
disappointment
presently
she
heard
wardo
little
feet
on
the
stairs
pattering
up
to
bed
and
his
voice
raised
in
his
ceaseless
questioning
then
a
little
later
lloyd
voice
singing
him
to
sleep
after
that
there
was
the
sound
below
of
people
coming
and
going
leland
harcourt
laugh
and
the
scrape
of
wheels
on
the
gravelled
drive
she
felt
a
dull
throb
of
gratitude
that
the
family
left
her
alone
a
long
time
after
she
heard
the
closing
and
locking
of
doors
and
then
steps
again
on
the
stairs
some
one
stopped
outside
her
door
betty
deah
she
answered
in
a
voice
which
she
tried
to
keep
steady
but
there
was
a
sob
in
it
and
divining
that
the
kindest
thing
would
be
not
to
notice
it
lloyd
choked
back
the
word
of
sympathy
she
longed
to
speak
and
went
on
to
her
room
nearly
an
hour
after
betty
got
up
and
lighting
her
lamp
sat
down
at
the
desk
where
the
rejected
manuscript
lay
turning
it
over
listlessly
she
read
a
paragraph
here
and
there
trying
to
see
it
through
the
eyes
of
the
publisher
who
had
returned
it
if
he
had
sent
merely
a
printed
notice
of
refusal
such
as
she
had
been
told
was
customary
stating
impersonally
that
it
was
returned
with
regret
because
unavailable
she
would
have
started
it
off
again
at
daybreak
to
another
place
knowing
that
what
does
not
fill
the
special
need
of
one
firm
may
be
seized
with
alacrity
by
another
but
this
man
had
taken
the
trouble
to
explain
why
it
was
unavailable
now
in
the
light
of
that
explanation
she
wondered
with
burning
cheeks
how
she
could
have
thought
for
one
instant
that
it
was
good
she
could
see
herself
that
it
was
crude
and
childish
and
ineffectual
not
the
style
in
which
it
was
written
betty
was
sure
of
her
ability
there
she
was
as
conscious
that
her
diction
and
composition
measured
up
to
the
best
standards
as
an
athlete
is
conscious
of
his
strength
it
was
her
of
life
that
had
amused
the
great
publisher
he
ridiculed
it
in
words
but
she
felt
his
covert
smile
at
her
schoolgirl
attempt
to
deal
with
the
world
big
problems
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
been
amused
cut
her
like
a
knife
pushing
the
package
aside
she
took
out
the
last
volume
of
her
diary
and
from
force
of
habit
made
an
entry
the
record
of
the
return
of
her
manuscript
it
has
come
back
to
me
the
little
bark
that
the
girls
launched
so
gaily
with
ceremony
and
good
wishes
it
has
come
back
a
shipwreck
it
was
almost
easier
to
face
blindness
than
it
is
to
face
this
failure
how
can
i
give
up
this
hope
that
has
grown
with
my
growth
till
it
means
more
than
everything
else
in
the
world
to
me
how
can
i
live
all
the
rest
of
my
life
without
it
somehow
for
years
i
have
felt
that
the
lord
wanted
me
to
write
the
feeling
was
like
the
king
call
to
edryn
and
i
have
gone
on
answering
it
as
he
did
list
thou
heart
and
hand
of
mine
keep
tryst
keep
tryst
or
die
of
course
it
would
be
folly
for
me
to
go
on
now
when
it
has
been
proved
beyond
all
doubt
that
i
am
not
able
to
keep
the
great
tryst
worthily
and
yet
life
seems
so
empty
with
this
one
high
hope
and
purpose
taken
out
of
it
that
i
am
not
brave
enough
to
face
it
cheerfully
it
had
long
been
a
habit
of
betty
formed
in
the
early
days
at
the
cuckoo
nest
to
comfort
herself
when
things
went
wrong
by
imagining
how
much
worse
they
might
have
been
now
there
was
a
drop
of
consolation
in
the
fact
that
she
had
never
displayed
her
pride
in
her
book
to
any
but
the
girls
it
had
been
a
temptation
to
show
it
to
her
godmother
and
papa
jack
and
the
colonel
especially
after
the
girls
had
applauded
it
so
enthusiastically
but
the
wish
for
them
to
see
it
at
its
best
had
made
her
withhold
it
in
its
manuscript
form
the
climax
of
her
triumph
was
to
be
when
she
placed
in
their
hands
a
real
book
their
criticism
might
have
spared
her
the
humiliation
of
a
rejected
manuscript
but
she
acknowledged
to
herself
that
it
was
easier
to
have
the
sentence
passed
on
it
by
a
stranger
than
by
the
three
whose
opinion
she
valued
most
tiptoeing
noiselessly
around
the
room
in
order
not
to
disturb
any
one
at
that
late
hour
she
undressed
slowly
and
creeping
into
bed
sobbed
herself
to
sleep
betty
had
always
been
a
sensible
little
soul
taking
her
small
troubles
like
a
philosopher
and
next
morning
when
she
was
awakened
by
the
first
and
lay
watching
the
light
creep
up
the
wall
the
old
childish
habit
of
thought
asserted
itself
bringing
an
unexpected
balm
to
her
sore
heart
she
had
always
loved
allegories
at
the
cuckoo
nest
she
had
helped
herself
over
all
the
rough
places
in
her
road
by
imagining
that
she
was
christian
in
pilgrim
progress
and
that
no
matter
how
hard
a
time
she
was
having
then
the
house
beautiful
and
the
delectable
mountains
and
the
city
of
the
shining
ones
lay
just
ahead
now
in
her
greater
trouble
it
was
the
allegory
of
edryn
that
brought
comfort
because
he
too
had
heard
the
king
call
and
striven
to
keep
tryst
and
she
remembered
that
when
he
knelt
to
receive
his
knighthood
something
else
besides
pearls
and
diamonds
flashed
on
his
vestment
above
his
heart
to
form
the
letters
semper
fidelis
amethyst
glowed
on
his
breast
in
purple
splendour
to
mark
his
patient
meeting
with
defeat
maybe
without
that
amethyst
he
could
have
spelled
all
the
motto
perfectly
thought
betty
she
sat
up
in
bed
her
face
alight
with
the
inspiration
of
the
thought
she
had
met
defeat
and
she
had
fallen
into
a
grievous
dungeon
of
disappointment
but
she
need
stay
in
it
she
sprang
out
of
bed
echoing
edryn
words
full
well
i
know
that
heaven
always
finds
a
way
to
help
the
man
who
helps
himself
and
even
dungeon
walls
must
harbour
help
for
him
who
boldly
grasps
the
first
thing
that
he
sees
and
makes
it
serve
him
it
was
a
brave
way
to
begin
the
day
and
it
carried
her
over
the
first
part
of
it
so
cheerfully
that
sherman
began
to
think
that
she
had
overestimated
betty
disappointment
it
surely
could
not
have
been
as
overwhelming
as
she
imagined
she
did
not
know
how
many
times
that
day
betty
courage
failed
her
edryn
words
seemed
like
a
hollow
mockery
and
she
brooded
over
the
failure
till
she
began
to
grow
morbid
and
late
that
afternoon
sherman
met
her
in
the
back
hall
with
the
manuscript
in
her
hands
she
was
on
her
way
to
put
it
in
the
kitchen
stove
promptly
rescuing
it
sherman
finally
obtained
her
reluctant
consent
to
let
her
read
it
it
is
your
right
said
betty
bitterly
no
matter
how
much
it
humiliates
me
you
have
done
everything
for
me
lavished
everything
on
me
as
if
i
were
really
your
daughter
and
i
have
disappointed
you
at
every
turn
i
could
be
the
brilliant
social
success
you
hoped
for
it
was
useless
to
try
and
i
could
be
the
success
in
literature
you
had
a
right
to
expect
though
i
did
try
that
with
all
my
soul
mind
and
strength
i
been
thinking
about
it
all
day
and
i
made
up
my
mind
at
last
that
i
burn
up
that
miserable
story
that
i
wasted
so
many
months
on
and
then
i
go
to
you
and
tell
you
that
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
away
and
not
be
an
expense
to
you
any
longer
as
long
as
there
was
a
prospect
of
my
amounting
to
something
some
day
that
would
make
you
proud
of
me
that
would
repay
you
in
part
for
all
you
done
i
did
mind
deepening
my
obligation
to
you
but
she
turned
to
the
window
to
hide
her
face
but
the
next
instant
she
found
herself
sitting
on
the
top
stair
with
her
head
on
her
shoulder
listening
to
such
loving
remonstrances
that
they
should
have
driven
away
the
last
vestige
of
her
bitter
it
did
help
wonderfully
to
hear
that
her
godmother
and
papa
jack
were
not
disappointed
in
though
grieved
for
her
disappointment
that
they
loved
her
for
her
own
dear
little
self
alone
and
not
for
the
things
they
hoped
she
would
achieve
and
that
they
could
let
her
go
away
for
nobody
could
ever
fill
the
place
of
their
dear
little
daughter
betty
she
wiped
her
eyes
after
awhile
and
smiled
like
an
april
day
but
she
still
persisted
that
she
must
go
away
somewhere
and
teach
if
only
to
prove
that
she
was
good
for
something
much
troubled
by
her
evident
distress
sherman
finally
went
to
talk
the
matter
over
with
the
old
colonel
sherman
was
away
from
home
several
days
after
she
called
betty
into
her
room
papa
has
read
your
manuscript
she
said
and
he
thinks
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
let
you
have
your
own
way
and
go
off
somewhere
for
awhile
he
says
that
in
his
opinion
your
writing
shows
unusual
promise
and
that
its
only
lack
is
the
lack
of
nearly
all
young
writers
your
ignorance
of
life
you
must
know
more
of
the
world
before
you
can
have
a
message
for
it
that
it
will
stop
to
listen
to
you
must
live
and
grow
and
gain
experience
and
he
thinks
the
best
way
for
you
to
do
all
that
is
to
depend
on
your
own
resources
for
awhile
and
that
the
kindest
thing
we
can
do
is
to
open
the
cage
and
give
the
little
bird
a
chance
to
try
its
own
wings
it
will
never
learn
to
fly
as
long
as
we
keep
it
hedged
about
so
carefully
he
finally
convinced
me
by
quoting
that
legend
of
to
me
he
says
you
are
like
shapur
now
a
vendor
of
salt
who
as
yet
can
only
follow
in
the
train
of
others
write
what
has
already
been
written
you
have
with
which
to
gain
a
royal
entrance
to
the
city
of
your
desire
you
need
some
desert
of
waiting
in
which
to
learn
the
secret
of
omar
alchemy
i
know
said
betty
i
know
now
what
my
writing
lacks
the
attar
that
gained
him
his
royal
entrance
she
quoted
softly
no
man
fills
his
crystal
vase
with
it
until
he
has
first
been
pricked
by
the
disappointments
and
bowed
by
its
tasks
oh
betty
my
dear
little
girl
said
sherman
taking
the
earnest
face
between
her
hands
and
looking
down
fondly
into
the
trusting
brown
eyes
raised
to
hers
i
suppose
it
true
but
i
ca
help
wanting
to
save
you
from
the
pricks
and
the
burdens
still
i
wo
stand
in
your
way
go
ahead
little
shapur
and
may
the
golden
gates
swing
wide
for
you
for
i
know
you
force
them
open
some
day
with
the
filling
of
your
crystal
vase
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
betty
was
hurrying
down
the
road
in
happy
haste
a
telegram
in
her
hand
for
warwick
hall
it
was
to
madam
chartley
asking
if
she
knew
of
any
vacant
position
for
teachers
in
any
of
the
schools
of
her
acquaintance
chapter
x
by
the
silver
with
her
days
shadowed
by
anxiety
over
ida
illness
the
care
and
responsibility
of
wardo
and
her
sympathy
for
betty
disappointment
lloyd
still
found
one
bright
spot
untouched
by
other
people
troubles
if
like
the
old
at
warwick
hall
she
had
taken
for
her
motto
i
only
mark
the
hours
that
shine
those
hours
when
leland
harcourt
came
to
teach
her
spanish
were
the
ones
that
would
have
been
numbered
if
she
had
felt
that
he
regarded
it
as
a
bore
or
that
it
cost
him
the
slightest
effort
she
would
have
dropped
the
study
immediately
but
when
he
made
it
plain
that
it
was
the
chief
interest
of
his
days
and
the
one
thing
that
made
his
summer
in
the
valley
endurable
she
could
not
help
being
flattered
by
his
assertions
and
exerted
herself
all
the
more
to
make
the
hour
a
pleasant
one
it
was
an
agreeable
sensation
to
know
that
she
could
interest
a
man
who
had
known
so
many
interests
that
it
was
she
who
held
him
in
lloydsboro
that
every
turn
of
her
head
every
inflection
of
her
voice
every
phase
of
her
varying
moods
had
a
charm
for
him
it
made
her
tingle
with
satisfaction
when
she
realized
that
she
had
justified
confidence
in
her
power
but
sometimes
after
he
had
gone
she
felt
that
she
was
not
exerting
it
to
the
extent
she
had
promised
she
keying
him
up
to
any
higher
pitch
she
was
inspiring
him
with
the
ambition
which
his
family
seemed
to
think
was
all
that
was
necessary
to
make
him
capable
of
any
achievement
the
idea
of
her
influencing
him
did
not
seem
as
preposterous
and
ridiculous
as
it
had
the
first
few
weeks
of
their
acquaintance
but
somehow
it
did
not
seem
so
necessary
sometimes
she
wondered
if
the
sweet
doing
nothing
that
gay
said
was
in
his
blood
had
not
affected
her
also
maybe
that
was
why
she
liked
his
very
indolence
and
forgave
in
him
what
she
would
have
condemned
in
any
other
chronic
idler
maybe
he
was
influencing
but
he
she
declared
to
herself
when
the
thought
first
startled
her
and
to
prove
that
he
had
she
seized
the
first
opportunity
which
came
in
her
way
to
take
him
to
task
his
signet
ring
bore
the
same
crest
that
was
on
the
silver
ladle
and
he
used
it
one
morning
to
seal
a
note
for
her
with
a
significant
glance
in
its
direction
she
asked
saucily
señor
tarrypin
when
are
you
going
to
put
your
family
motto
into
actual
use
when
are
you
going
to
begin
striving
till
you
ovahcome
till
you
do
something
really
worth
while
in
the
world
with
the
question
came
the
quick
remembrance
of
a
winter
day
by
the
churchyard
stile
and
malcolm
boyish
voice
protesting
earnestly
be
anything
you
want
me
to
be
lloyd
and
then
like
a
flash
came
that
other
scene
and
phil
pleading
voice
i
say
it
in
all
humility
lloyd
this
little
bit
of
turquoise
kept
me
blue
if
she
had
expected
any
such
earnestness
in
leland
reply
she
was
soon
disillusioned
for
with
an
amused
at
her
as
if
he
found
this
serious
mood
the
most
diverting
of
all
he
said
indifferently
oh
she
translated
quickly
but
never
comes
then
neither
need
the
effort
but
without
the
effort
the
striving
she
persisted
looking
down
at
the
imprint
of
the
tiny
dagger
on
the
seal
there
never
will
be
any
crown
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
carelessly
what
the
odds
when
one
care
for
a
crown
you
just
plain
lazy
she
cried
provoked
that
her
effort
to
inspire
him
had
met
with
such
a
reception
he
smiled
as
if
she
had
paid
him
the
greatest
of
compliments
then
sat
up
with
an
air
of
interest
this
is
a
topic
we
never
struck
before
he
said
lightly
it
like
coming
across
an
inviting
bypath
we
never
travelled
over
now
suppose
you
tell
me
just
what
is
your
ideal
way
for
a
man
to
spend
his
life
in
order
to
get
the
most
out
of
it
lloyd
stole
a
quick
glance
at
him
to
see
if
he
were
in
earnest
the
light
tone
seemed
almost
mocking
but
the
eyes
gazing
out
across
the
lawn
were
serious
enough
and
she
studied
her
reply
a
moment
feeling
that
maybe
her
opportunity
had
come
at
last
i
think
she
began
timidly
that
the
man
who
gets
the
most
out
of
life
is
the
one
who
makes
most
of
himself
who
starts
out
as
they
did
in
the
old
days
to
win
his
spurs
and
his
accolade
maybe
you
know
the
story
of
edryn
the
one
that
gave
warwick
hall
its
motto
he
nodded
with
that
slightly
amused
smile
which
always
disconcerted
her
yes
i
know
that
gay
pet
tryst
but
go
on
i
like
to
hear
your
version
of
it
in
the
face
of
such
an
invitation
she
found
it
very
hard
to
proceed
but
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
said
almost
defiantly
oh
i
know
you
considah
it
a
bit
of
sentiment
to
look
at
life
in
such
a
figurative
way
but
i
think
it
beautiful
duty
and
to
she
quoted
softly
disappointment
and
defeat
thou
mayst
be
called
no
matter
what
the
tryst
there
is
but
one
reply
if
thou
wouldst
win
thy
knighthood
but
suppose
one
never
hears
any
call
he
asked
teasingly
never
feels
the
spirit
move
him
to
make
any
particular
exertion
then
it
yoah
own
fault
cried
lloyd
it
just
as
it
says
in
the
legend
those
will
hear
who
wake
at
dawn
to
listen
in
high
places
and
only
those
will
heed
who
keep
the
compass
needle
of
their
soul
true
to
the
north
star
of
a
great
ambition
pretty
strenuous
work
is
that
for
an
august
day
he
answered
and
that
all
very
well
for
poets
and
priests
and
young
idealists
to
dream
of
but
when
all
said
and
done
what
the
good
what
the
use
clasping
his
hands
behind
his
head
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
began
reciting
in
a
dreamy
way
as
if
he
were
chanting
the
rhythmical
lines
a
poem
called
drifting
it
was
like
an
incantation
and
lloyd
sat
listening
as
if
he
were
weaving
some
spell
around
her
soul
is
far
away
sailing
the
vesuvian
bay
my
winged
boat
a
bird
afloat
swims
round
the
purple
peaks
remote
heed
not
if
my
rippling
skiff
float
swift
or
slow
from
cliff
to
cliff
with
dreamful
eyes
my
spirit
lies
under
the
walls
of
paradise
as
he
went
musically
on
verse
after
verse
lloyd
sat
listening
wholly
under
the
spell
of
his
voice
yet
with
a
baffled
impotent
sense
of
being
carried
along
by
a
current
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
from
the
one
in
which
she
had
started
to
go
more
no
more
the
worldly
shore
upbraids
me
with
its
wild
uproar
it
was
a
lotus
land
of
irresponsibility
and
ease
and
personal
gratification
that
he
was
revealing
to
her
as
his
ideal
of
life
he
had
openly
made
fun
of
her
enthusiasm
and
zeal
but
he
had
chilled
her
ardour
and
silenced
her
and
left
her
with
the
feeling
that
her
knights
with
their
struggles
after
accolades
and
ambitions
and
all
those
things
were
silly
folk
who
made
much
ado
about
nothing
it
made
her
cross
in
the
silence
that
followed
there
was
a
shriek
from
wardo
somewhere
back
near
the
servants
quarters
and
then
such
a
lusty
crying
that
lloyd
sprang
up
frightened
and
ran
to
the
rescue
she
was
for
having
left
him
so
long
to
the
care
of
enoch
cindy
little
grandson
whom
she
had
bribed
to
amuse
him
for
an
hour
it
was
only
because
his
constant
presence
and
interruptions
seemed
to
bore
leland
that
she
had
done
it
wardo
did
make
tyrannical
demands
on
her
attention
she
had
to
admit
dearly
as
she
loved
the
child
but
when
she
found
him
crying
from
a
and
his
poor
little
lip
swollen
out
of
all
resemblance
to
a
cupid
bow
she
felt
a
twinge
of
resentment
towards
leland
if
she
had
sent
wardo
away
from
her
she
thought
reproachfully
he
would
have
been
stung
and
she
would
have
sent
him
if
leland
had
acted
nicer
about
having
him
around
he
had
actually
muttered
in
mom
beck
hearing
that
it
was
a
beastly
bore
always
having
that
kid
poking
in
she
had
resented
it
at
the
time
mom
beck
repeated
it
but
excused
it
on
the
ground
that
he
was
not
used
to
children
and
that
wardo
persistent
questions
and
demands
did
tax
one
patience
dreadfully
sometimes
but
now
as
he
clung
to
her
sobbing
and
screaming
she
thought
reproachfully
he
might
at
least
have
come
around
to
find
out
what
was
the
mattah
when
he
knows
how
devoted
i
am
to
the
poah
little
thing
even
if
he
did
take
any
interest
in
him
himself
i
keep
wardo
with
me
all
the
time
aftah
this
even
if
it
does
him
leading
him
back
to
the
porch
she
took
him
in
her
lap
and
quieted
him
with
the
promise
of
a
wonderful
box
of
paints
which
he
should
have
next
day
with
which
to
colour
all
the
pretty
pictures
in
all
the
magazines
and
she
quite
ignored
leland
for
awhile
to
punish
him
not
knowing
that
he
understood
her
pique
and
was
amused
at
it
and
that
he
was
enjoying
the
picture
she
made
rocking
back
and
forth
in
the
low
chair
with
wardo
golden
curls
pressed
against
her
shoulder
and
the
dimpled
arms
clinging
around
her
neck
next
day
she
forgot
the
paints
until
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
get
them
and
betty
who
was
going
over
to
the
beeches
and
past
the
store
offered
to
take
wardo
and
let
him
have
the
pleasure
of
buying
them
himself
after
they
had
gone
she
went
down
to
the
porch
to
wait
for
leland
it
was
almost
lesson
time
yesterday
feeling
of
resentment
had
entirely
passed
and
she
looked
down
the
avenue
expectantly
from
her
seat
behind
the
vines
any
moment
he
might
turn
in
at
the
gate
the
thought
gave
her
a
pleasant
thrill
of
anticipation
as
the
moments
slipped
by
she
opened
her
book
and
began
repeating
the
verses
marked
for
her
to
memorize
presently
she
looked
up
to
see
a
small
coloured
boy
wandering
up
the
avenue
as
if
he
had
no
particular
destination
in
view
and
no
great
desire
to
arrive
anywhere
she
supposed
he
was
the
bearer
of
a
message
to
the
cook
but
instead
of
going
around
the
house
he
came
towards
her
with
a
note
in
his
hand
it
was
from
leland
she
saw
at
the
first
glance
and
written
in
spanish
at
the
second
she
could
read
enough
of
it
to
understand
that
he
was
not
coming
that
morning
but
for
the
rest
of
it
she
had
to
turn
to
her
lexicon
for
help
in
translating
after
some
time
and
with
much
difficulty
she
managed
to
make
out
the
reason
he
had
gone
to
louisville
for
the
day
quite
unexpectedly
with
his
brother
a
matter
of
business
he
was
sorry
not
to
be
able
to
keep
his
engagement
with
her
only
dire
necessity
kept
him
away
and
he
would
be
with
her
in
the
evening
until
then
adieu
she
had
to
turn
to
her
lexicon
again
for
that
next
word
and
having
found
it
wondered
how
he
had
dared
to
put
it
in
that
caressing
little
name
that
word
of
endearment
which
he
would
not
have
presumed
to
use
in
english
it
made
the
colour
flame
up
in
her
face
but
he
was
not
coming
she
let
the
note
fall
to
her
lap
with
an
exclamation
of
disappointment
then
wide
eyed
and
surprised
she
sat
up
straight
suddenly
aware
how
deep
that
disappointment
was
suddenly
realizing
what
she
had
never
known
till
this
moment
how
large
a
place
leland
harcourt
had
grown
to
hold
in
her
thoughts
everywhere
she
turned
she
could
see
his
face
with
that
quick
flashing
smile
she
loved
to
bring
to
it
she
could
see
that
impetuous
toss
of
the
head
the
eager
gesture
of
his
long
slender
hand
the
easy
grace
of
his
manner
that
gave
him
his
distinguished
patrician
air
why
i
like
hildegarde
she
whispered
wonderingly
eyes
are
so
blue
they
fill
all
my
dreams
only
mistah
harcourt
are
dark
now
if
lloyd
had
never
heard
the
story
of
the
three
weavers
never
been
a
member
of
the
order
of
hildegarde
never
made
the
promise
to
her
father
about
the
silver
her
reverie
in
the
hammock
that
morning
might
have
led
to
a
very
different
result
but
because
she
had
promised
and
because
she
must
keep
tryst
no
matter
how
hard
it
was
to
do
she
faced
the
matter
squarely
he
would
have
put
that
word
in
the
note
if
he
was
beginning
to
care
for
me
she
admitted
and
it
would
make
me
have
that
queah
little
sawt
of
glad
feeling
if
i
was
beginning
to
care
for
him
the
hammock
swung
faster
she
was
thinking
of
a
day
on
the
seashore
years
before
when
she
had
been
playing
out
on
the
rocks
and
while
she
built
her
little
castles
the
tide
came
creeping
in
creeping
so
quietly
that
she
did
not
know
it
was
there
until
all
the
sand
between
her
and
safety
was
covered
and
a
fisherman
had
to
wade
in
and
carry
her
out
although
she
did
not
put
the
comparison
into
words
that
was
what
she
felt
was
happening
now
and
much
as
she
liked
him
and
loved
to
be
with
him
and
missed
him
when
he
did
not
come
she
felt
that
his
influence
over
her
was
creeping
up
like
a
tide
that
would
surely
drown
her
ability
to
keep
her
promise
to
her
father
he
influence
me
she
admitted
to
herself
i
might
as
well
be
honest
about
it
sometimes
he
can
almost
make
me
believe
that
black
is
white
how
do
i
know
but
what
i
might
grow
to
be
like
poah
mistaken
hertha
he
was
only
a
page
but
she
called
him
prince
in
her
thought
until
she
really
believed
him
one
then
as
yesterday
conversation
came
back
to
her
she
sprang
from
the
hammock
saying
to
herself
and
he
is
even
a
knight
or
he
have
made
fun
of
my
poah
little
attempt
to
make
him
listen
to
the
call
i
not
think
about
him
a
minute
longah
it
would
only
be
squandahing
the
golden
thread
that
clotho
left
me
running
up
the
stairs
she
got
her
hat
and
started
to
follow
betty
but
all
the
way
up
and
all
the
way
down
and
all
the
way
that
she
went
towards
the
beeches
that
little
word
at
the
end
of
the
letter
that
sweet
caressing
of
a
name
sang
itself
over
and
over
to
her
he
had
called
her
that
and
he
was
coming
she
did
not
go
all
the
way
to
the
beeches
for
she
met
betty
on
the
way
back
wardo
proudly
bearing
his
box
of
paints
and
betty
a
letter
which
she
had
found
in
the
office
it
was
from
madam
chartley
there
was
a
vacancy
in
warwick
hall
itself
and
she
was
to
fill
it
was
to
be
her
beloved
miss
chilton
assistant
in
the
english
classes
her
happiness
was
as
great
over
this
news
as
her
disappointment
had
been
over
the
return
of
her
manuscript
as
madam
chartley
wanted
her
at
the
school
by
the
first
of
september
there
were
only
two
weeks
in
which
to
make
her
preparations
to
leave
although
lloyd
had
heard
the
matter
discussed
she
never
fully
believed
that
betty
was
going
away
from
locust
until
she
had
the
letter
in
her
own
hands
and
read
madam
chartley
expression
of
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
having
betty
with
her
permanently
it
swept
away
all
thought
of
her
own
affairs
for
betty
had
grown
as
dear
to
her
as
a
sister
in
the
years
they
had
been
together
she
followed
her
mournfully
into
the
white
and
gold
room
offering
to
help
her
with
her
preparations
and
pouring
out
her
regret
and
her
disapproval
of
betty
plans
it
necessary
at
all
she
insisted
for
betty
to
leave
them
and
locust
would
be
the
same
place
with
her
gone
wardo
required
less
attention
than
usual
that
afternoon
for
charmed
with
his
new
paints
he
sat
at
a
low
table
in
betty
room
while
the
girls
sewed
and
talked
and
coloured
the
pictures
in
every
magazine
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
it
was
sunset
when
lloyd
noticed
how
long
he
had
been
bending
over
the
table
and
persuaded
him
to
lay
aside
his
brush
till
next
day
look
at
the
pretty
red
sunset
she
urged
trying
to
interest
him
in
something
else
it
as
red
as
a
cherry
he
looked
at
it
solemnly
considering
her
comparison
no
it
wed
as
the
blood
of
a
thousand
dwagons
he
answered
lloyd
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
what
do
you
know
about
dragons
child
betty
telled
me
when
i
painted
one
wif
my
paints
here
in
this
book
he
began
turning
the
leaves
of
one
of
the
magazines
dwagons
is
the
stwongest
fings
there
is
he
added
with
a
knowing
wag
of
his
head
feeling
that
she
needed
enlightenment
but
my
fahvah
could
fight
one
he
so
stwong
my
fahvah
could
fight
anyfing
always
the
same
old
story
said
lloyd
in
a
low
tone
to
betty
it
dreadful
always
harping
on
the
perfection
of
his
hero
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
bettah
if
she
had
not
tried
to
keep
the
truth
from
him
the
disillusionment
is
going
to
be
feahful
some
of
these
days
it
will
shake
his
belief
in
everything
as
she
rocked
back
and
forth
with
his
warm
little
body
nestled
against
her
she
thought
how
differently
ida
would
have
chosen
could
she
have
known
that
this
precious
little
soul
was
to
be
given
into
her
keeping
if
somebody
had
only
gone
to
her
with
old
warning
remember
that
in
the
right
weaving
of
this
web
depends
not
only
thy
own
happiness
but
the
happiness
of
those
who
come
after
thee
it
might
have
made
a
world
of
difference
but
nobody
had
opened
her
eyes
to
the
enormity
of
the
responsibility
she
was
assuming
and
now
maybe
despite
all
her
careful
training
and
frantic
efforts
to
make
her
little
son
what
she
would
have
him
be
she
might
not
be
able
to
turn
his
life
out
of
the
channel
of
his
inherited
tastes
and
appetites
it
must
be
she
thought
hugging
him
closer
to
love
a
child
with
the
passionate
devotion
that
ida
loved
this
one
and
have
it
grow
up
into
a
worthless
vagabond
like
ned
bannan
then
a
stray
wonder
crossed
her
mind
if
leland
harcourt
mother
would
have
been
disappointed
in
him
if
she
could
have
lived
to
see
him
wasting
his
splendid
talents
and
opportunities
just
drifting
along
in
an
aimless
thistledown
sort
of
existence
when
he
might
be
such
a
power
for
good
if
he
would
only
exert
himself
he
does
measuah
up
to
the
third
notch
at
all
she
admitted
with
a
feeling
of
regret
just
then
there
was
a
long
distance
call
for
her
at
the
telephone
and
hastily
putting
wardo
down
she
went
to
answer
it
it
from
mistah
harcourt
she
called
carelessly
in
answer
to
her
mother
inquiry
from
the
next
room
he
was
coming
ovah
but
something
detained
him
in
louisville
and
he
called
me
up
to
tell
me
not
to
expect
him
she
hoped
that
she
had
kept
the
flutter
out
of
her
voice
that
the
sound
of
his
voice
brought
into
her
pulses
for
at
the
close
of
this
commonplace
message
was
the
request
that
she
make
no
engagement
with
any
one
else
for
the
next
night
he
had
something
to
tell
her
and
then
there
was
that
same
word
with
which
he
had
closed
his
note
that
soft
musical
name
seeming
twice
as
personal
and
significant
because
of
the
tone
in
which
he
said
it
she
felt
that
he
must
be
conscious
of
the
quick
blush
it
brought
to
her
face
as
she
hastily
hung
up
the
receiver
that
night
for
the
first
time
that
summer
lloyd
was
alone
with
her
father
and
mother
betty
had
madam
chartley
letter
to
answer
and
the
old
colonel
had
gone
out
to
dinner
the
three
sat
on
the
broad
porch
in
the
moonlight
lloyd
on
the
step
at
her
feet
her
arm
on
his
knee
ever
since
the
telephone
message
her
thoughts
had
been
in
a
tumult
it
was
useless
for
her
to
pretend
that
she
know
why
leland
wanted
to
see
her
alone
and
what
it
was
he
was
coming
to
tell
her
she
was
glad
and
sorry
and
half
frightened
and
altogether
confused
he
is
the
prince
at
all
she
kept
saying
to
herself
as
if
it
were
a
charm
that
would
help
her
ward
off
his
approach
and
keep
her
true
to
her
hildegarde
promise
and
yet
his
wooing
was
the
kind
one
reads
of
in
books
she
would
be
sorry
to
have
come
to
an
end
it
was
so
delightful
to
have
some
one
write
poems
to
her
and
sing
songs
in
such
a
way
that
every
tone
and
glance
dedicated
them
to
her
alone
if
one
could
only
go
on
that
way
through
all
the
summers
being
adored
in
that
fashion
knowing
she
was
crowned
queen
in
somebody
heart
how
delightful
it
would
be
but
she
did
want
things
to
come
to
a
crisis
when
she
would
have
to
make
grave
decisions
and
solemn
promises
she
did
want
to
go
one
step
farther
than
this
borderland
of
romance
where
they
lingered
now
what
she
wanted
was
just
to
go
on
building
her
little
castles
as
she
had
done
that
day
on
the
and
yet
be
assured
that
the
tide
would
come
creeping
up
any
farther
it
was
just
far
enough
now
to
be
interesting
she
wished
they
would
begin
to
talk
about
things
like
that
but
she
shrank
from
bringing
up
such
a
subject
herself
after
awhile
she
broached
one
almost
akin
mothah
she
asked
breaking
a
long
comfortable
silence
that
had
fallen
on
them
do
you
think
that
lucy
is
happy
no
not
entirely
that
is
just
at
present
sherman
answered
slowly
as
if
considering
she
hardly
adjusted
herself
yet
to
the
new
order
of
things
but
she
will
in
time
because
she
such
a
yielding
little
soul
and
is
really
devoted
to
her
husband
for
instance
when
he
insisted
she
gave
up
her
church
to
please
him
and
joined
his
it
meant
a
great
struggle
and
a
sacrifice
on
her
part
and
he
is
not
at
all
devout
does
attend
services
more
than
twice
a
year
so
it
could
have
made
such
a
vital
difference
to
him
where
she
went
then
at
home
her
father
always
placed
a
certain
amount
in
the
bank
every
month
to
his
wife
credit
so
there
never
was
any
unpleasantness
about
money
matters
while
jameson
is
very
wealthy
and
lavishes
luxuries
and
beautiful
clothes
on
her
he
reserves
the
pleasure
of
buying
and
spending
entirely
to
himself
treats
her
like
a
child
in
their
financial
arrangements
and
doles
out
little
allowances
as
if
she
could
be
trusted
to
spend
it
intelligently
she
so
sensitive
that
she
rather
go
without
than
ask
him
for
a
cent
and
it
often
puts
her
in
an
embarrassing
position
to
be
without
in
other
words
put
in
papa
jack
he
thoroughly
inconsiderate
and
selfish
although
i
imagine
he
be
mightily
amazed
if
any
one
applied
that
term
to
him
since
he
is
so
lavish
in
giving
things
in
his
own
way
yes
he
is
was
the
answer
i
noticed
it
in
a
dozen
little
ways
it
always
wishes
and
tastes
that
have
to
be
consulted
never
lucy
yet
aside
from
that
trait
he
is
a
thoroughly
fine
man
and
because
she
respects
him
and
looks
up
to
him
and
is
such
a
sweet
yielding
little
creature
he
come
in
time
to
be
the
centre
of
her
universe
and
she
revolve
around
him
like
a
loyal
little
planet
but
a
girl
of
a
different
temperament
would
if
she
were
impetuous
and
highstrung
like
you
for
instance
she
added
with
a
smile
at
lloyd
she
would
see
the
injustice
of
it
and
resent
it
so
bitterly
that
there
would
be
continual
friction
and
jar
with
your
temperament
you
could
live
peaceably
with
anybody
like
that
i
know
i
could
admitted
lloyd
frankly
especially
if
he
showed
any
jealousy
mistah
jameson
is
jealous
of
every
friend
lucy
evah
had
at
the
post
he
does
like
it
a
bit
when
she
refers
to
the
good
times
she
used
to
have
with
the
boys
there
even
when
they
were
just
ordinary
friends
half
a
dozen
times
i
seen
the
tears
come
to
her
eyes
at
some
inconsiderate
thing
he
say
and
i
think
if
i
were
lucy
i
sit
there
and
take
it
like
a
martyr
i
have
to
jump
up
and
shake
him
till
his
teeth
rattled
what
a
cat
and
dog
time
you
would
have
laughed
sherman
worse
than
little
mary
ware
nightmare
that
she
had
after
eugenia
wedding
by
the
way
exclaimed
sherman
slapping
his
pockets
to
find
a
letter
he
had
placed
in
one
of
them
i
knew
there
was
something
i
intended
to
tell
you
jack
ware
is
on
his
way
here
now
then
in
answer
to
the
surprise
and
the
questions
that
greeted
his
announcement
he
explained
i
suggested
making
him
assistant
manager
of
the
mines
and
the
company
wants
to
have
a
look
at
him
and
put
him
through
a
sort
of
examination
he
so
young
they
rather
doubt
my
judgment
in
the
matter
but
they
find
out
when
they
see
him
we
telegraphed
him
to
come
and
he
left
arizona
several
days
ago
he
be
here
only
a
day
and
night
probably
lloyd
left
her
seat
on
the
step
and
took
a
chair
beside
her
father
sitting
straight
and
alert
in
her
interest
it
was
hard
to
realize
that
jack
ware
was
grown
he
was
only
fourteen
when
she
had
known
him
on
the
desert
oh
will
you
evah
forget
she
laughed
the
way
he
looked
when
we
surprised
him
at
the
washtub
all
tied
up
in
an
apron
helping
joyce
with
the
family
washing
his
readiness
to
pitch
in
to
whatever
is
to
be
done
is
his
chief
characteristic
was
the
answer
that
is
what
makes
him
so
valuable
at
the
mines
patient
and
reliable
and
strong
he
is
one
of
the
finest
young
fellows
of
my
acquaintance
he
be
one
of
the
big
men
of
the
west
some
day
for
young
as
he
is
he
is
into
everything
that
makes
for
the
welfare
and
development
of
the
territory
he
lives
in
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
spent
in
recalling
that
visit
to
wigwam
and
when
lloyd
went
up
to
bed
although
leland
harcourt
name
had
not
been
mentioned
she
felt
that
her
doubts
and
unspoken
questions
about
him
had
been
answered
she
must
not
listen
any
more
to
that
little
name
that
caressing
little
name
that
left
such
a
thrill
in
its
wake
wise
old
hildgardmar
said
sherman
in
a
playful
tone
after
lloyd
had
left
them
i
do
suppose
when
you
sent
for
jack
that
it
entered
your
head
you
were
giving
her
the
very
safeguard
of
contrast
that
i
hoped
she
might
have
but
you
will
be
doing
it
all
the
same
no
i
did
he
confessed
but
i
think
you
are
magnifying
the
interest
she
has
in
harcourt
she
never
mentioned
his
name
all
evening
but
she
talked
all
around
him
answered
sherman
and
i
think
she
came
to
the
conclusion
before
she
went
that
he
does
not
measure
up
to
your
standards
and
is
almost
sure
that
he
does
not
even
meet
hers
chapter
xi
the
end
of
several
things
the
old
colonel
was
in
the
library
telling
for
the
hundredth
time
to
the
small
listener
on
his
knee
the
story
of
the
battle
that
had
taken
his
right
arm
for
since
wardo
had
found
that
his
father
father
was
in
the
same
wild
charge
against
the
yankees
and
had
fought
like
a
tiger
till
a
wound
in
the
head
and
another
in
the
knee
sent
him
to
the
rear
on
a
stretcher
he
could
not
hear
the
story
often
enough
and
that
led
to
other
tales
of
things
that
had
happened
when
the
two
were
schoolboys
it
puzzled
wardo
to
find
any
resemblance
between
the
mischievous
boy
whom
the
colonel
referred
to
as
cy
bannon
and
the
dignified
judge
whose
picture
hung
on
the
wall
of
the
colonel
den
oh
his
name
was
cyrus
edward
then
just
as
yours
is
now
explained
the
colonel
when
he
finally
understood
the
difficulty
but
it
was
too
long
a
name
for
such
a
grasshopper
of
a
lad
he
have
been
out
of
sight
before
you
could
say
it
all
so
they
cut
it
down
to
cy
just
as
yours
is
cut
to
wardo
will
i
be
judge
cywus
edwa
bannon
then
when
i
gwoed
up
asked
wardo
the
seriousness
of
the
big
innocent
eyes
fixed
on
him
made
the
colonel
move
uneasily
heaven
knows
he
muttered
do
but
it
to
be
hoped
you
take
after
him
instead
of
the
one
next
in
line
of
succession
the
question
made
such
a
profound
impression
on
him
he
could
not
shake
it
off
and
acting
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
he
decided
to
take
it
to
the
judge
himself
for
an
answer
he
would
show
him
the
winsome
little
lad
who
bore
his
name
he
would
demand
of
him
what
right
he
had
to
withhold
from
him
the
protection
and
shelter
that
was
his
heritage
the
child
father
had
been
cast
off
in
proud
scorn
for
his
profligate
ways
secretly
the
colonel
had
always
thought
that
his
old
friend
had
shirked
responsibility
and
that
the
open
repudiation
of
him
by
his
family
had
given
ned
his
final
downward
shove
it
made
no
difference
to
the
colonel
that
ned
name
was
a
forbidden
one
in
the
household
tell
cy
bannon
a
few
things
then
his
face
softened
and
he
smiled
a
trifle
foolishly
muttering
something
about
its
being
a
case
of
the
pot
calling
the
kettle
black
the
judge
might
come
back
at
him
with
the
argument
that
he
had
been
just
as
harsh
with
his
own
child
for
far
less
cause
but
that
would
only
give
him
a
chance
to
urge
a
reconciliation
on
the
ground
that
had
surrendered
gracefully
and
had
been
glad
of
it
ever
since
cy
would
be
a
mighty
queer
sort
of
man
he
concluded
if
he
could
hold
out
against
such
a
little
grandson
as
wardo
he
was
a
child
to
walk
into
affections
lloyd
had
left
the
pair
so
deeply
absorbed
in
that
she
was
surprised
on
her
return
to
the
library
a
little
later
to
find
no
trace
of
either
of
them
they
gone
for
a
trolley
ride
walker
told
her
and
expected
to
be
gone
most
of
the
morning
so
relieved
of
her
responsibility
lloyd
made
a
longer
visit
in
rollington
than
usual
the
crisis
had
been
passed
some
time
now
and
ida
was
so
much
better
she
was
beginning
to
talk
about
wardo
return
she
would
be
able
to
sit
up
in
a
few
days
as
lloyd
entertained
her
with
accounts
of
wardo
sayings
and
doings
she
realized
more
and
more
what
a
large
place
he
had
come
to
fill
in
the
household
and
how
sorely
they
would
all
miss
him
when
they
had
to
give
him
up
ida
future
looked
so
hopeless
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
she
would
be
strong
enough
to
begin
sewing
again
she
talked
wearily
of
the
burden
she
must
assume
as
soon
as
possible
and
lloyd
came
away
weighed
down
with
a
sense
of
the
injustice
and
wrong
in
the
world
and
her
helplessness
to
right
it
it
was
nearly
noon
when
she
reached
the
house
wardo
who
had
just
come
in
with
her
grandfather
rushed
down
the
steps
to
meet
her
his
sailor
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
his
arms
outstretched
to
give
her
glad
welcome
he
clasped
her
around
the
knees
and
put
up
his
face
to
be
kissed
his
morning
adventures
made
him
feel
that
he
had
been
away
an
age
then
his
voice
trembling
with
the
importance
of
his
news
he
announced
the
three
things
of
his
visit
which
had
made
the
most
impression
on
him
i
saw
the
place
on
my
head
where
the
yankee
bullet
hit
him
wite
over
his
eye
an
the
colonel
he
shaked
his
stick
at
my
and
got
wed
in
the
face
when
he
talked
then
digging
down
into
the
mite
of
a
pocket
that
graced
his
blouse
he
triumphantly
brought
out
the
third
item
a
silver
dollar
that
judge
bannon
had
given
him
by
this
time
the
colonel
had
come
out
and
in
answer
to
lloyd
excited
questions
confessed
the
truth
of
wardo
tale
he
shaken
his
stick
at
the
judge
they
had
had
a
stormy
interview
and
he
lost
his
temper
he
was
sorry
at
first
that
he
had
taken
wardo
the
child
was
so
frightened
but
it
proved
a
good
move
for
his
appealing
little
face
pleaded
his
cause
better
than
anything
else
could
have
done
and
in
the
end
the
judge
was
completely
won
over
by
his
handsome
little
namesake
concluded
the
colonel
triumphantly
he
promised
to
take
ned
back
and
give
him
one
more
chance
he
keep
the
lad
and
his
mother
in
any
event
and
he
to
send
for
them
just
as
soon
as
she
able
to
be
moved
oh
you
blessed
old
cried
lloyd
running
up
the
steps
to
throw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
give
him
as
rapturous
a
hug
as
wardo
had
given
her
you
a
perfect
darling
and
you
made
me
so
happy
i
do
know
what
to
do
or
say
i
believe
i
as
happy
as
ida
will
be
when
she
heahs
it
and
i
going
ovah
there
the
minute
i
had
lunch
to
tell
her
you
a
public
benefactah
and
everything
else
in
the
dictionary
that
extra
nice
and
fine
it
was
joy
to
the
colonel
to
have
his
praises
sung
like
that
and
he
went
around
the
rest
of
the
week
with
a
virtuous
feeling
that
kept
him
beaming
benignly
on
everything
and
everybody
in
such
an
angelic
humour
was
he
that
walker
confided
to
mom
beck
that
he
was
right
worried
ole
marse
it
was
a
day
of
surprises
for
the
whole
family
on
lloyd
return
from
her
second
visit
to
rollington
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
she
saw
jack
ware
on
the
rear
platform
of
the
which
passed
the
carriage
when
she
was
nearly
home
he
had
arrived
two
days
sooner
than
any
one
expected
he
could
taller
broader
and
browner
by
far
than
the
slim
lad
who
waved
her
farewell
from
the
wigwam
he
was
unmistakably
the
same
jack
and
she
would
have
recognized
him
anywhere
the
second
glance
showed
her
father
standing
just
behind
him
they
both
leaned
out
and
waved
their
hats
as
they
passed
the
carriage
a
moment
later
they
were
stepping
off
the
car
opposite
the
entrance
gate
and
waiting
for
her
to
come
up
anothah
knight
comes
riding
she
thought
with
a
smile
wondering
what
put
the
whimsical
notion
in
her
head
for
she
did
not
count
jack
in
that
class
he
was
simply
her
good
comrade
of
the
plains
nothing
picturesque
about
i
do
suppose
there
could
be
about
the
modern
knight
she
thought
amused
that
such
fancies
should
come
to
her
his
only
thought
is
to
there
when
young
lochinvar
comes
out
of
the
west
now
his
the
best
from
that
standpoint
but
you
ca
make
the
pictuahs
and
poems
out
of
that
you
can
out
of
hawses
in
those
fancy
trappings
stepping
out
of
the
carriage
she
sent
it
on
ahead
and
turned
to
jack
with
such
a
cordial
welcome
that
he
reddened
with
pleasure
under
the
brown
of
his
sunburned
cheeks
this
is
my
land
as
well
as
mary
he
said
as
they
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
and
he
paused
to
look
up
at
the
grand
old
trees
arching
over
them
you
no
idea
how
i
looked
forward
to
seeing
all
this
mother
always
pictured
it
as
a
sort
of
beulah
land
then
joyce
took
up
the
same
tune
and
lastly
mary
she
the
most
enthusiastic
of
all
and
sat
up
till
midnight
the
day
she
found
i
was
coming
to
make
a
list
of
all
the
things
she
said
i
must
fail
to
see
or
ask
about
taking
a
memorandum
book
from
his
pocket
he
opened
it
and
held
it
out
for
lloyd
and
her
father
to
see
there
were
three
pages
whereon
mary
had
set
down
instructions
for
him
to
follow
lloyd
laughed
as
she
glanced
at
the
things
to
do
without
fail
make
mr
rob
moore
acquaintance
and
see
oaklea
see
the
beeches
and
all
walton
curios
especially
the
bells
of
luzon
and
see
if
elise
walton
is
as
pretty
as
she
used
to
be
and
notice
how
she
does
her
hair
now
ask
lloyd
to
play
on
the
harp
and
sing
the
dove
song
when
the
candles
are
lighted
in
the
the
list
was
such
a
long
one
that
lloyd
did
not
read
farther
but
glanced
at
the
page
headed
things
not
so
important
but
i
like
to
know
ask
about
girlie
dinsmore
if
you
have
a
chance
is
she
as
much
of
a
baby
as
ever
what
has
become
of
that
horrid
bernice
howe
does
betty
still
correspond
with
the
pilgrim
father
look
in
the
on
the
north
side
of
the
library
and
copy

name
of
that
book
on
spiders
find
out
all
you
can
about
the
man
allison
is
going
to
marry
there
were
a
dozen
similar
items
is
that
characteristic
of
mary
exclaimed
lloyd
she
such
a
deah
little
bunch
of
curiosity
maybe
i
ought
to
call
it
that
a
live
intense
interest
in
everything
and
everybody
would
be
moah
like
it
but
only
hours
to
do
it
all
in
how
can
we
manage
it
not
even
that
answered
sherman
for
part
of
it
must
be
spent
with
the
and
you
could
stay
longah
began
lloyd
no
i

back
at
the
mines
very
shortly
and
i
want

and
stop
over
at
annapolis
for
a
glimpse
of
holland
you
know
i
never

east
before
and
i
want
to
make
the
most
of
it
well
said
lloyd
planning
rapidly
as
they
walked
on
we
crowd
just
as
much
as
possible
into
this
one
evening
there
be
time
for
a
drive
befoah
dinnah
that
will
give
you
a
view
of
the

and
ask
rob
to

ask
the
waltons
to
come
ovah
she
would
have
paused
just
there
even
if
they
had
not
reached
the
house
and
her
sentence
been
interrupted
by
jack
introduction
to
her
mother
and
betty
for
as
she
mentioned
telephoning
it
flashed
across
her
what
leland
had
telephoned
her
not
to
make
any
engagement
for
that
evening
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
alone
but
suahly
she
thought
he
undahstand
that
that
is
impossible
undah
the
circumstances
the
only
night
jack
will
be
heah
the
next
few
hours
flew
by
as
if
winged
they
caught
lloyd
up
out
of
the
in
which
she
had
been
living
and
thoroughly
wakened
her
it
was
such
a
busy
breezy
world
from
jack
outlook
so
much
to
do
and
see
and
conquer
as
she
listened
to
his
description
of
the
little
mining
camp
that
had
grown
into
a
town
in
the
short
time
he
had
been
there
and
then
to
the
enthusiastic
plans
he
unfolded
to
her
father
of
what
the
mine
owners
might
do
to
develop
and
civilize
it
she
found
herself
regarding
this
young
aladdin
of
the
west
with
growing
consideration
he
and
rob
found
mutual
interests
from
the
moment
of
meeting
she
noted
with
surprise
how
oddly
alike
they
were
in
their
views
she
had
known
before
that
rob
was
interested
in
so
many
things
that
she
knew
nothing
about
political
situations
and
juvenile
court
reforms
and
trusts
and
unions
and
all
those
things
but
then
she
had
scarcely
seen
him
since
he
had
taken
a
man
place
in
the
world
good
old
rob
she
was
proud
of
the
way
he
was
discussing
these
things
with
jack
and
her
father
and
the
colonel
there
was
a
note
of
authority
in
what
he
said
that
the
older
men
respected
but
it
did
seem
so
funny
for
him
to
be
talking
of
anything
weightier
than
tennis
and
skating
and
his
latin
exams
or
college
scrapes
he
talked
almost
as
well
as
leland
harcourt
she
admitted
after
dinner
jack
took
out
his
memorandum
and
crossed
off
all
the
items
that
had
been
attended
to
while
they
were
laughing
over
questions
and
dictating
answers
for
him
to
write
lest
he
forget
them
the
waltons
arrived
with
gay
who
had
been
spending
the
day
with
them
a
little
later
alex
shelby
followed
he
was
on
mary
list
and
had
a
number
of
messages
to
send
to
the
little
girl
who
had
amused
him
so
greatly
at
eugenia
wedding
with
her
quaint
speeches
and
unexpected
questions
from
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
number
of
people
in
the
one
might
have
imagined
that
a
reception
was
in
full
swing
when
leland
harcourt
came
up
on
the
porch
lloyd
recognizing
his
step
hurried
out
to
meet
him
and
explain
why
she
had
been
unable
to
grant
his
request
she
ushered
him
into
the
to
meet
their
guest
anxious
that
they
should
be
favourably
impressed
with
each
other
one
could
always
count
on
leland
for
doing
the
graceful
thing
socially
she
thought
complacently
but
this
one
time
he
failed
her
he
had
been
at
the
house
so
constantly
all
summer
that
she
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
make
any
special
effort
for
his
entertainment
now
other
than
to
draw
him
into
the
conversation
with
jack
and
rob
they
were
the
comparative
strangers
and
she
was
giving
them
the
most
of
her
attention
rob
had
been
at
the
house
only
twice
that
summer
he
was
as
interested
as
she
in
hearing
about
joyce
and
mary
so
when
she
found
that
leland
did
not
seem
to
care
to
talk
she
went
back
to
their
former
conversation
recalling
the
duck
hunt
the
picnic
at
and
their
dinner
at
coffe
al
with
phil
tremont
everybody
else
was
talking
everybody
else
seemed
in
good
spirits
but
leland
harcourt
lloyd
could
almost
feel
his
silence
it
became
so
marked
he
sulky
she
thought
it
just
his
horrid
jealousy
cropping
out
like
his
brothah
jameson
he
does
want
me
to
be
nice
to
my
oldest
and
deahest
friends
i
wish
he
would
act
that
way
then
she
sang
since
it
was
next
in
order
on
mary
memorandum
and
while
she
sang
although
she
did
not
once
look
at
him
directly
she
was
uncomfortably
conscious
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
with
the
determined
gaze
which
they
always
wore
when
he
had
some
resolve
which
he
intended
to
carry
out
at
all
hazards
as
she
turned
from
the
harp
he
was
the
first
to
rise
and
place
a
chair
for
her
bending
over
her
he
said
under
cover
of
the
applause
not
be
put
off
any
longer
you
must
let
me
see
you
a
few
minutes
just
as
soon
as
i
can
make
an
opportunity
for
you
to
slip
out
of
the
room
low
as
his
voice
was
rob
who
was
sitting
just
behind
him
heard
what
he
said
and
then
something
else
that
he
added
in
spanish
just
a
word
but
it
seemed
to
carry
some
potent
appeal
for
with
a
slight
flush
she
rose
leland
made
the
opportunity
he
wished
by
saying
to
jack
that
one
of
the
pleasures
not
to
be
missed
was
hearing
gay
play
the
violin
of
course
jack
immediately
asked
for
the
nocturne
which
he
suggested
and
gay
always
obliging
at
once
complied
under
cover
of
the
music
leland
stepped
into
the
hall
holding
the
portière
aside
with
a
bow
for
lloyd
to
pass
through
rob
glance
followed
them
across
the
hall
across
the
moonlighted
porch
to
the
avenue
where
the
locust
shadows
fell
dense
and
black
then
he
turned
his
attention
resolutely
to
the
music
listening
as
if
in
rapt
enjoyment
but
in
reality
never
hearing
a
note
the
nocturne
came
to
an
end
and
there
was
an
encore
and
still
another
before
lloyd
came
back
into
the
room
she
was
alone
and
rob
in
one
quick
glance
saw
that
all
the
bright
colour
had
left
her
face
she
was
gripping
her
little
lace
fan
nervously
and
her
hazel
eyes
had
deepened
almost
to
black
as
they
always
did
under
the
strain
of
unusual
excitement
or
emotion
he
was
sure
that
she
was
very
near
tears
and
with
his
usual
impulse
to
shield
her
from
all
that
was
unpleasant
he
moved
his
chair
so
that
no
one
else
saw
her
agitation
and
began
talking
volubly
about
the
first
thing
he
could
think
of
it
happened
to
be
mary
ware
method
of
getting
rid
of
an
unwelcome
guest
by
playing
fox
and
stork
and
as
she
listened
to
the
lengthy
story
he
purposely
made
of
it
she
had
time
to
regain
her
composure
before
any
one
else
came
up
afterwards
he
heard
her
explaining
to
walton
mistah
harcourt
had
to
leave
early
and
did
want
to
break
up
the
by
coming
in
to
say
good
night
when
rob
heard
next
day
that
leland
was
leaving
the
valley
at
once
for
a
trip
to
south
america
he
thought
he
understood
the
cause
of
agitation
it
distressed
her
to
have
him
go
so
far
away
he
had
been
positive
for
some
time
that
there
was
some
understanding
between
them
now
this
confirmed
his
suspicions
lloyd
was
grieved
over
the
parting
but
not
to
the
extent
rob
imagined
many
a
night
after
she
sat
curled
up
on
the
in
her
room
looking
down
through
the
trees
to
the
place
where
she
had
stood
with
leland
the
night
she
bade
him
she
had
not
dreamed
of
such
a
stormy
interview
as
that
she
had
not
imagined
any
wooing
could
be
so
impassioned
reaching
to
such
heights
and
depths
he
had
paid
the
slightest
attention
when
she
tried
to
stop
him
but
had
asserted
triumphantly
that
he
always
got
what
he
started
out
to
win
and
that
this
was
a
matter
of
life
and
death
and
he
win
her
love
or
die
in
the
attempt
sometimes
in
thinking
it
over
she
was
afraid
he
would
make
his
threats
true
and
then
sometimes
she
thought
with
a
quick
indrawn
breath
remembering
how
his
wild
protestations
had
thrilled
her
that
it
would
have
been
sweet
to
listen
if
she
could
only
have
been
sure
that
it
was
right
he
vowed
he
would
come
back
when
he
could
prove
to
her
that
he
had
won
the
accolade
which
she
seemed
to
think
was
so
essential
but
she
did
not
look
for
him
in
her
heart
she
said
that
the
one
real
romance
of
her
life
was
at
an
end
everything
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
just
then
jack
left
the
next
morning
and
before
the
close
of
the
week
wardo
was
taken
away
ida
was
able
to
be
moved
to
the
old
bannon
homestead
near
anchorage
although
it
was
the
one
great
thing
lloyd
had
wished
for
she
missed
her
little
charge
at
every
turn
and
the
days
stretched
out
ahead
of
her
long
and
empty
the
first
of
september
betty
went
away
with
elise
walton
under
her
wing
happy
in
the
fact
that
she
was
to
enter
freshman
at
warwick
hall
where
the
older
girls
had
had
such
glorious
times
the
next
day
the
harcourts
closed
the
cabin
and
went
back
to
san
antonio
gay
spent
her
last
night
in
the
valley
at
the
locusts
and
there
were
more
confidences
before
they
fell
asleep
long
after
midnight
seems
as
if
the
end
of
the
summah
brings
the
end
of
everything
sighed
lloyd
regretfully
it
more
like
the
beginning
of
everything
for
you
contradicted
gay
you
be
beginning
your
shopping
soon
and
your
trips
to
the
tailor
and
the
dressmaker
and
the
milliner
and
you
know
you
enjoy
getting
all
the
lovely
clothes
you
to
have
as
a
débutante
it
be
as
much
fun
as
planning
a
trousseau
then
there
be
your
début
party
in
your
aunt
jane
lovely
big
town
house
and
all
the
rest
that
to
follow
it
be
just
a
regular
procession
of
social
successes
and
triumphs
and
as
for
leland
she
continued
mentioning
him
for
the
first
time
since
his
departure
you
need
worry
about
of
course
we
knew
what
had
happened
just
as
soon
as
he
bounced
in
looking
like
a
and
announced
his
intention
of
leaving
next
morning
we
seen
it
coming
on
all
summer
jameson
is
tickled
to
death
over
it
for
this
trip
to
south
america
is
one
he
has
been
wanting
him
to
take
for
a
long
time
they
have
some
property
there
that
needs
looking
after
and
he
thinks
now
that
his
ambition
is
roused
he
take
some
interest
in
things
but
no
mattah
what
he
does
said
lloyd
firmly
i
nevah
change
my
mind
i
do
want
to
get
married
gay
she
added
almost
tearfully
i
read
a
story
the
othah
day
the
diary
of
a
young
girl
that
made
me
think
of
myself
she
said
do
want
to
be
married
just
to
be
loved
and
adored
and
written
to
and
crowned
queen
of
somebody
heart
of
any
girl
wants
that
just
the
way
i
feel
confided
gay
after
a
moment
pause
then
you
been
so
busy
this
summer
with
your
own
affairs
i
do
suppose
you
noticed
what
been
going
on
around
you
but
i
afraid
i
got
myself
into
a
pickle
you
see
i
already
invited
kitty
down
to
san
antonio
to
spend
lent
with
me
and
i
written
to
frank
percival
about
her
and
told
her
about
him
and
got
them
interested
in
each
other
you
know
ever
since
i
been
so
intimate
with
kitty
i
wanted
her
to
marry
frank
so
that
she
always
live
near
me
and
now
now
i
not
so
sure
that
i
going
to
live
there
myself
you
dreadful
little
laughed
lloyd
so
amused
by
confession
that
she
never
thought
to
inquire
what
had
caused
her
change
of
mind
about
her
own
residence
you
ought
to
meddle
in
such
things
just
look
what
a
pickle
you
got
into
if
you
had
made
me
promise
what
you
did
about
being
nice
to
mistah
harcourt
and
told
him
the
things
you
did
about
me
we
nevah
have
had
the
scene
we
did
and
would
have
been
good
friends
always
but
look
what
you
done
sent
him
on
a
hopeless
chase
aftah
a
shadow
for
he
says
he
nevah
change
his
mind
and
i
i
wo
change
mine
gay
giggled
when
an
irresistible
force
meets
an
immovable
body
what
happen
i
always
wondered
just
what
will
happen
when
mistah
harcourt
comes
back
was
dignified
answer
not
be
moved
and
he
not
to
be
resisted
said
gay
so
there
we
go
in
the
same
old
circle
but
i
glad
for
some
reasons
that
you
so
determined
for
if
i
make
up
my
mind
to
live
in
the
valley
then
i
be
glad
you
were
here
instead
of
in
san
antonio
oh
are
you
all
going
to
buy
the
cabin
exclaimed
lloyd
sitting
up
in
bed
in
her
eagerness
how
lovely
no
all
are
not
confessed
gay
i
you
did
have
any
idea
of
what
was
going
on
this
summer
but
well
you
know
who
my
first
of
the
was
he
says
the
scripture
says
that
first
shall
be
last
and
he
insists
he
is
he
wants
to
buy
the
cabin
some
day
so
that
my
little
mirror
can
hang
there
always
up
among
the
roses
where
he
first
saw
me
it
be
sweet
and
romantic
would
it
but
it
does
seem
exactly
fair
to
kitty
to
get
her
tied
up
down
there
and
then
skip
out
and
leave
her
kitty
is
tied
up
yet
by
a
long
shot
laughed
lloyd
who
found
it
hard
to
take
gay
shy
confession
seriously
but
i
ca
get
used
to
this
lightning
change
in
you
you
were
so
suah
you
not
have
any
darby
and
joan
emotions
in
yours
while
is
may
you
talked
all
summah
against
early
marriages
i
not
an
body
like
you
and
i
would
be
a
little
nearer
gray
hairs
if
we
waited
for
two
years
as
we
certainly
have
to
do
but
even
if
we
did
wait
it
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
with
lucy
and
jameson
and
some
other
young
married
people
i
know
alex
is
so
well
he
is
she
insisted
indignantly
what
are
you
laughing
at
you
know
he
different
yes
i
do
know
it
answered
lloyd
instantly
sobered
by
her
realization
of
the
fact
that
gay
was
no
longer
joking
but
was
laying
bare
her
heart
dearest
secret
he
a
deah
good
fellow
and
he
be
just
as
loving
and
true
and
sweet
to
you
always
as
the
old
doctah
is
to
aunt
alicia
nobody
could
want
moah
than
that
i
suah
so
heah
my
blessing
and
the
hope
that
you
live
to
keep
yoah
golden
wedding
as
happily
as
they
are
going
to
do
she
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
tenderly
they
talked
so
late
that
night
that
gay
almost
missed
her
train
next
morning
but
as
she
scrambled
breathlessly
on
to
the
rear
platform
she
called
back
happily
what
the
odds
even
if
it
did
make
me
late
it
was
such
a
nice
to
such
a
glorious
summer
chapter
xii
six
months
later
it
was
a
cold
snowy
afternoon
late
in
january
rob
moore
looking
at
his
watch
as
he
hurried
along
the
street
found
that
he
was
ten
minutes
ahead
of
the
time
at
which
the
next
car
was
due
to
start
to
the
valley
rather
than
wait
on
the
windy
corner
or
take
refuge
in
the
already
crowded
he
walked
on
down
to
the
he
rarely
left
town
this
early
as
he
sprang
up
the
steps
and
took
his
seat
in
the
waiting
car
he
saw
that
it
was
the
one
usually
filled
by
the
living
in
the
suburbs
it
was
already
nearly
filled
now
by
boys
and
girls
flocking
in
with
their
book
straps
and
it
made
him
think
of
his
own
high
school
days
they
laughed
and
joked
and
called
messages
back
and
forth
as
freely
as
if
they
were
at
home
here
and
there
he
recognized
the
younger
sisters
and
brothers
of
some
of
his
old
classmates
so
like
them
that
it
gave
him
a
curious
sense
of
having
stepped
backward
several
years
there
was
wat
sewall
wriggling
and
writhing
out
of
his
overcoat
with
the
same
contortions
that
fred
always
went
through
with
that
slap
on
the
back
with
its
accompanying
hi
there
old
man
was
exactly
like
williams
salutation
he
nearly
always
laid
a
fellow
out
flat
when
he
spoke
to
him
and
the
couple
on
the
seat
in
front
of
him
exchanging
class
pins
was
only
a
repetition
of
a
scene
he
had
witnessed
dozens
of
times
with
a
reminiscent
smile
he
shook
out
the
pages
of
the
evening
paper
which
he
had
bought
as
he
came
along
and
glanced
at
the
but
before
he
had
time
to
read
further
the
girl
in
front
of
him
exclaimed
look
harry
here
comes
miss
sherman
is
she
perfectly
stunning
in
that
dark
blue
broadcloth
i
think
she
the
prettiest
débutante
of
the
season
she
a
peach
was
the
enthusiastic
answer
i
say
ethel
she
looks
like
you
rob
did
not
see
the
girlish
blush
which
rose
to
ethel
cheeks
for
at
the
first
exclamation
he
had
lowered
his
paper
to
peer
quickly
through
the
window
he
had
just
a
glimpse
of
a
slender
stylish
figure
hurrying
into
the
ticket
office
the
girl
in
front
was
speaking
i
suppose
i
been
more
interested
in
the
débutantes
this
year
than
any
other
because
cousin
amy
is
one
of
them
she
comes
out
to
anchorage
for
a
now
and
then
to
rest
up
and
i
keep
her
talking
the
whole
time
about
what
they
do
she
says
that
miss
sherman
is
the
most
popular
of
them
all
with
the
girls
as
well
as
the
men
she
had
so
many
beautiful
entertainments
given
in
her
honour
and
she
been
asked
to
help
receive
or
pour
tea
or
do
something
or
other
at
every
single
function
that
been
given
in
louisville
this
winter
i
think
it
perfectly
grand
to
be
out
in
society
when
you
can
be
as
great
a
success
as
that
they
say
that
the
american
beauties
sent
to
her
in
just
one
day
sometimes
would
fill
a
florist
shop
window
there
a
man
from
cincinnati
who
sends
them
all
the
time
he
crazy
about
her
i
should
be
too
if
i
were
a
man
cousin
amy
has
a
photograph
of
her
taken
in
evening
dress
and
she
simply
regal
looking
i
wonder
she
makes
a
sensation
wherever
she
goes
here
she
comes
now
interrupted
the
boy
turning
with
a
stare
of
frank
admiration
rob
turned
too
as
lloyd
came
down
the
aisle
glancing
from
one
side
to
another
for
an
empty
seat
her
face
was
glowing
from
her
walk
in
the
cold
wind
and
the
little
hat
of
dark
blue
velvet
and
her
rich
dark
furs
made
her
seem
fairer
than
ever
by
contrast
hers
was
a
delicate
patrician
style
of
beauty
and
rob
in
one
critical
glance
saw
that
this
winter
in
society
had
given
the
graceful
girl
the
ease
and
poise
of
a
charming
woman
the
little
on
the
seat
in
front
had
good
reason
for
admiring
her
so
extravagantly
he
rose
as
she
came
nearer
and
stepped
out
in
the
aisle
to
give
her
the
seat
by
the
window
oh
rob
this
is
great
the
little
heard
her
exclaim
cordially
i
have
seen
you
for
an
age
how
does
it
happen
you
are
going
out
on
such
an
early
train
much
as
she
was
interested
in
harry
remarks
she
wished
he
would
keep
still
at
least
until
the
car
started
she
wanted
to
hear
how
this
big
handsome
man
answered
her
adorable
miss
sherman
she
would
have
been
shocked
could
she
have
heard
his
second
remark
there
a
big
flake
of
soot
on
your
nose
lloyd
thanks
she
said
almost
looking
in
her
endeavour
to
locate
it
there
usually
is
in
this
dirty
town
there
is
it
off
she
scrubbed
away
with
a
bit
of
a
handkerchief
she
took
from
her
muff
and
i
was
flattering
myself
as
i
came
along
that
i
looked
especially
spick
and
span
she
sighed
it
refreshing
to
have
somebody
tell
you
the
truth
about
yoahself
and
you
nevah
were
one
to
mince
mattahs
bobby
the
old
name
on
the
lips
of
this
pretty
girl
so
like
the
old
lloyd
in
some
ways
yet
so
bewilderingly
unlike
in
others
stirred
him
strangely
better
throw
off
your
furs
and
that
heavy
jacket
in
this
car
was
his
only
answer
you
take
cold
when
you
get
off
if
you
do
she
thanked
him
for
the
suggestion
and
as
he
hung
her
wraps
over
the
back
of
the
seat
settled
herself
comfortably
for
the
ride
now
tell
me
all
about
it
he
began
as
the
car
started
all
that
you
been
doing
these
last
months
of
course
i
kept
up
with
you
in
the
papers
i
know
that
you
went
here
and
went
there
and
that
you
wore
pink
folderols
at
this
banquet
and
velvet
satin
crêpe
de
chine
at
the
country
club
dinner
with
feathers
and
jewels
to
match
but
that
no
more
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
knows
i
want
to
be
let
in
on
the
ground
floor
and
told
about
the
inner
workings
of
this
social
whirl
how
have
you
managed
to
do
it
all
to
vibrate
between
town
and
country
and
not
peg
out
you
look
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
as
if
the
pace
that
kills
agrees
with
you
i
have
vibrated
much
she
answered
i
made
aunt
jane
house
my
headquartahs
and
you
know
what
a
crank
she
is
about
hygiene
every
moment
not
actually
engaged
in
she
had
reduced
to
a
system
of
simple
living
what
i
have
suffered
in
the
way
of
naps
in
a
darkened
room
when
i
was
sleepy
and
hot
milk
when
i
loathed
the
idea
of
swallowing
anything
and
gymnastic
exercises
in
the
attic
when
the
weathah
was
too
bad
for
long
walks
would
fill
a
volume
is
the
game
worth
the
candle
he
asked
soberly
she
hesitated
well
yes
for
a
season
anyhow
i
would
want
to
keep
up
such
a
round
yeah
aftah
yeah
but
i
had
a
good
time
and
i
must
confess
it
awfully
nice
to
be
really
grown
up
and
have
everybody
treat
you
with
the
consideration
due
yoah
age
they
were
out
in
the
open
country
now
the
car
stopped
and
as
the
door
opened
to
admit
a
passenger
the
shrill
voices
of
some
children
skating
on
an
ice
pond
near
the
road
floated
cheerily
in
lloyd
looked
out
the
window
with
a
smile
at
the
gay
scene
i
like
to
be
out
there
with
them
she
confessed
look
at
that
little
girl
in
the
red
mittens
and
tam
she
skates
exactly
the
way
katie
mallard
used
to
oh
deah
did
we
used
to
have
fun
with
her
down
on
our
ice
pond
do
you
remember
the
day
malcolm
broke
through
when
he
was
trying
to
on
the
ice
asked
rob
with
a
reminiscent
grin
he
was
laughing
about
that
only
last
week
when
he
took
me
to
the
country
club
dinnah
i
seen
a
lot
of
malcolm
this
wintah
i
thought
he
was
rushing
molly
standforth
well
he
is
of
the
time
but
he
rushed
me
too
as
you
call
it
just
as
much
rob
gave
her
a
keen
glance
but
she
made
the
announcement
in
such
a
calm
way
that
he
said
to
himself
there
could
be
much
in
it
as
far
as
she
was
concerned
or
she
would
have
spoken
of
it
in
the
way
she
did
at
anchorage
the
boy
and
girl
in
front
left
the
car
he
with
such
open
solicitude
for
her
comfort
as
he
helped
her
off
that
lloyd
eyes
met
rob
with
a
twinkle
aftah
all
it
good
to
be
young
like
that
she
said
do
you
remembah
kitty
and
guy
ferris
at
that
age
how
we
used
to
tease
kitty
for
keeping
a
dead
rose
and
a
valentine
and
a
brass
button
from
his
military
coat
tied
up
with
a
blue
ribbon
in
a
candy
box
but
we
boys
had
a
better
time
teasing
guy
about
the
lock
of
hair
that
he
carried
around
in
the
back
of
his
watch
his
watch
got
out
of
order
and
when
the
jeweller
opened
it
and
found
all
that
hair
in
the
back
he
did
say
a
word
but
with
a
most
disgusted
look
tossed
it
into
the
wastebasket
as
if
it
had
been
guy
most
sacred
possession
i
was
along
with
him
and
i
simply
roared
guy
did
have
the
nerve
to
ask
for
it
just
stood
there
looking
like
the
big
silly
he
must
have
felt
the
series
of
reminiscences
that
this
story
started
lasted
all
the
way
out
to
the
valley
the
red
streak
of
the
wintry
sunset
had
faded
out
of
the
west
when
the
car
stopped
there
and
lloyd
looking
out
into
the
cold
gray
gloaming
saw
that
the
snow
was
beginning
to
fall
again
let
get
out
and
walk
the
rest
of
the
way
she
exclaimed
impetuously
snatching
up
her
jacket
and
furs
as
she
rose
i
have
had
a
twilight
walk
in
the
country
this
wintah
when
all
good
and
gray
like
this
with
in
yoah
face
they
were
off
in
another
instant
and
as
he
stood
on
the
station
platform
helping
her
on
with
her
wraps
she
held
up
her
face
to
feel
the
stray
flakes
blowing
cold
and
soft
against
it
he
smiled
at
her
childish
delight
in
them
and
seeing
the
smile
she
started
up
the
narrow
path
ahead
of
him
laughing
over
her
shoulder
there
no
use
denying
it
she
called
back
when
i
want
to
be
the
propah
dignified
young
lady
i
have
to
stay
in
town
just
the
smell
of
the
country
the
fresh
earth
the
fallen
leaves
has
such
a
rejuvenating
effect
that
i
want
to
tuck
up
my
skirts
and
skip
and
run
as
i
used
to
come
on
he
exclaimed
gaily
falling
in
with
her
mood
i
race
you
to
that
dead
sycamore
up
the
road
she
looked
up
at
him
her
face
dimpling
as
she
noticed
how
he
towered
above
her
and
how
broad
were
the
shoulders
in
the
big
overcoat
then
she
shook
her
head
sadly
nevah
again
bobby
we
too
old
and
dignified
i
almost
as
soon
think
of
racing
with
the
judge
as
with
you
now
what
if
somebody
should
see
us
they
be
shocked
to
death
there
some
one
now
she
added
peering
forward
through
the
dusk
only
old
unc
andy
coming
back
from
his
rabbit
traps
answered
rob
as
the
grizzled
old
coloured
man
shuffled
nearer
uncle
andy
had
been
the
gardener
at
oaklea
more
years
than
lloyd
could
remember
and
now
as
he
stepped
out
of
the
path
with
elaborate
courtesy
to
let
her
pass
she
delighted
his
soul
by
stopping
with
a
friendly
inquiry
about
himself
and
family
lawd
if
it
aint
the
little
herself
he
chuckled
all
growed
up
and
a
bloomin
like
a
piney
i
reckon
miss
lloyd
youse
forgot
the
time
that
you
pulled
up
all
the
pansies
in
my
flowah
beds
you
said
they
was
makin
faces
at
you
no
indeed
uncle
andy
she
answered
with
a
laugh
and
started
to
pass
on
but
the
encounter
with
the
old
servant
seemed
somehow
to
set
her
back
among
the
days
when
she
had
been
almost
as
much
at
home
at
oaklea
as
she
was
at
the
locusts
and
prompted
by
some
sudden
impulse
she
called
over
her
shoulder
as
she
had
often
called
then
unc
andy
tell
moore
that
mistah
rob
wo
be
home
for
dinnah
he
going
to
stay
at
the
locusts
it
was
a
familiar
message
although
it
had
been
several
years
since
andy
had
heard
it
he
looked
back
bowing
and
scraping
and
then
walked
on
chuckling
to
himself
taken
by
surprise
rob
did
not
remonstrate
when
she
thus
took
his
consent
for
granted
if
she
had
waited
to
ask
his
permission
to
send
such
a
message
home
he
would
have
made
some
excuse
to
decline
and
then
left
her
at
the
gate
that
night
under
the
measuring
tree
when
he
listened
to
her
singing
he
had
resolutely
made
up
his
mind
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
since
then
he
had
become
convinced
that
she
was
engaged
to
leland
harcourt
and
had
put
her
out
of
his
dreams
as
far
as
possible
now
that
she
had
left
him
no
choice
he
gladly
accepted
the
opportunity
that
fate
seemed
to
throw
in
his
way
and
gave
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
it
the
fitful
snow
had
stopped
falling
again
by
the
time
they
reached
the
gate
and
the
stars
were
beginning
to
glimmer
through
the
bare
branches
of
the
as
lloyd
looked
up
the
avenue
and
saw
the
lights
from
many
windows
streaming
out
across
the
porch
into
the
winter
night
her
gay
mood
suddenly
changed
to
one
of
intense
feeling
is
it
deah
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
nevah
had
it
come
ovah
me
so
overwhelmingly
how
good
it
is
to
come
back
to
the
things
that
nevah
change
that
nevah
fail
the
and
the
the
same
old
trees
and
the
same
old
and
the
same
old
chum
rob
made
no
answer
but
his
silence
was
only
another
proof
to
lloyd
that
she
had
found
her
old
chum
unchanged
he
never
answered
at
the
times
when
she
knew
he
felt
most
deeply
rob
silences
expressed
more
sometimes
than
other
people
speeches
he
was
talkative
enough
at
dinner
however
and
between
them
he
and
lloyd
made
the
meal
such
a
lively
one
that
the
old
colonel
heaved
a
sigh
when
it
was
over
i
give
a
good
deal
if
our
whist
club
did
meet
he
said
in
response
to
lloyd
question
i
surely
would
have
asked
them
to
postpone
it
if
i
had
known
you
were
coming
out
suahly
not
a
institution
like
that
exclaimed
lloyd
teasingly
and
when
it
yoah
turn
to
entahtain
it
rob
we
found
out
what
refreshments
mothah
has
for
them
think
of
wasting
all
this
time
without
knowing
it
had
always
been
a
matter
of
interest
with
them
in
earlier
times
to
have
a
finger
in
this
particular
pie
it
was
one
thing
in
which
sherman
was
most
careful
to
humour
her
father
whims
and
she
always
pleased
him
by
giving
her
personal
attention
to
the
dainty
little
suppers
which
she
served
after
the
game
lloyd
led
the
way
to
the
pantry
and
they
lifted
covers
and
opened
doors
smelling
and
peering
around
till
they
unearthed
all
the
tempting
dishes
that
had
been
so
carefully
prepared
for
the
occasion
we
be
in
at
the
end
warned
lloyd
as
the
colonel
old
cronies
began
to
arrive
and
in
the
meantime
i
pop
some
cawn
i
used
to
think
that
old
majah
timberly
came
for
my
cawn
as
much
as
he
did
for
the
game
to
his
great
annoyance
a
telephone
message
called
sherman
over
to
the
confederate
home
he
had
looked
forward
to
a
quiet
evening
in
front
of
the
great
log
fire
and
was
loath
to
leave
the
cosy
room
and
cheerful
company
presently
some
household
matters
claimed
presence
and
she
too
had
to
go
leaving
lloyd
at
the
piano
playing
runs
and
trills
and
snatches
of
songs
as
a
sort
of
undercurrent
to
their
conversation
rob
in
a
big
armchair
in
front
of
the
fire
looking
comfortable
enough
to
want
to
purr
glanced
around
the
familiar
old
room
that
long
association
had
made
as
dear
to
him
as
home
why
do
you
read
your
letters
he
asked
his
gaze
happening
to
rest
on
a
pile
of
various
sized
envelopes
lying
on
the
table
near
him
all
bearing
lloyd
name
she
turned
around
on
the
piano
stool
and
held
out
her
hand
for
them
as
he
rose
to
take
them
to
her
i
forgot
all
about
the
possibility
of
there
being
any
mail
for
me
she
said
tearing
open
the
first
one
this
is
from
betty
i
know
you
want
to
hear
that
so
i
read
it
aloud
crossing
the
room
she
seated
herself
under
one
of
the
silver
sconces
in
the
chimney
corner
so
that
the
candlelight
fell
on
the
paper
she
had
never
relinquished
the
idea
that
came
to
her
on
her
return
from
school
that
rob
was
growing
especially
fond
of
betty
it
seemed
to
her
such
a
desirable
state
of
affairs
that
she
longed
to
deepen
his
interest
in
her
i
am
not
being
carried
to
the
skies
on
flowery
beds
of
ease
by
any
manner
of
means
wrote
betty
life
at
warwick
hall
as
a
pupil
is
one
thing
it
is
quite
another
to
be
a
teacher
but
i
gaining
experience
and
that
what
i
came
for
and
best
of
all
i
having
some
little
successes
that
make
me
take
heart
and
feel
like
attempting
more
i
have
had
two
little
sketches
of
life
accepted
and
mark
the
paid
for
by
the
and
a
request
for
more
hope
is
swift
and
flies
with
swallows
wings
kings
it
makes
gods
and
meaner
creatures
you
can
imagine
how
happy
i
am
over
it
and
what
castles
in
the
air
i
am
already
building
again
it
was
a
long
newsy
letter
telling
of
a
reception
she
had
attended
at
the
white
house
to
which
she
took
half
a
dozen
girls
in
madam
chartley
place
and
describing
a
famous
lecturer
who
had
been
at
the
hall
the
day
before
betty
a
girl
in
a
thousand
said
rob
approvingly
as
she
slipped
the
letter
back
in
its
envelope
she
a
dear
little
piece
with
sense
and
pluck
enough
for
a
dozen
his
hearty
tone
confirmed
lloyd
suspicions
and
she
looked
as
pleased
as
if
he
had
paid
her
a
compliment
instead
of
betty
she
led
him
on
to
express
a
still
deeper
appreciation
by
telling
of
some
of
the
things
that
elise
walton
had
written
home
about
betty
kindness
to
the
new
girls
and
how
they
all
adored
her
then
she
opened
the
next
letter
from
phil
tremont
she
said
glancing
down
the
page
he
back
in
new
york
and
has
just
seen
eugenia
who
is
still
delighted
with
housekeeping
and
makes
an
ideal
home
for
stewart
and
the
doctor
and
he
seen
joyce
she
added
turning
the
page
and
joyce
is
as
happy
as
a
clam
struggling
along
with
a
lot
of
in
a
flat
and
really
doing
well
with
her
designs
and
illustrations
she
read
a
paragraph
aloud
here
and
there
then
hastily
looked
over
the
last
part
in
silence
laying
it
down
with
a
little
sigh
rob
glanced
up
inquiringly
i
wish
he
would
make
such
a
about
my
writing
moah
regularly
it
makes
a
task
of
a
correspondence
instead
of
a
pleasuah
to
know
that
every
two
weeks
rain
or
shine
i
expected
to
send
an
answah
i
like
to
write
if
i
can
choose
my
own
time
and
wait
till
the
spirit
moves
me
but
i
despise
to
be
nagged
into
doing
it
you
write
to
betty
every
week
he
suggested
yes
sometimes
twice
or
three
times
but
that
different
i
seen
phil
for
two
yeahs
and
when
you
do
see
people
for
a
long
time
you
ca
keep
in
touch
with
them
the
song
says
makes
the
heart
grow
fonder
quoted
rob
mischievously
maybe
it
does
if
you
old
friends
and
have
lots
to
remembah
togethah
but
it
seems
to
me
that
absence
builds
up
a
sawt
of
wall
between
people
sometimes
especially
if
you
known
each
othah
only
a
little
while
and
at
a
time
when
you
both
growing
up
and
changing
all
the
time
do
you
know
she
added
musingly
dropping
the
letter
into
her
lap
and
leaning
forward
to
gaze
into
the
fire
i
believe
if
phil
and
i
had
been
togethah
daily
i
have
grown
awfully
fond
of
him
when
we
were
out
on
the
desert
in
arizona
i
was
only
that
spring
he
was
my
ideal
of
all
that
was
lovely
and
romantic
and
i
believe
if
it
been
for
those
talks
papa
jack
and
i
used
to
have
about
hildegarde
and
her
weaving
i
have
done
like
foolish
hertha
cut
my
web
for
him
then
and
there
i
did
imagine
for
awhile
that
he
was
a
prince
and
the
one
written
for
me
in
the
and
now
asked
rob
in
a
low
tone
as
if
afraid
of
interrupting
the
confession
she
was
making
more
to
the
fire
and
herself
than
to
him
now
she
answered
when
he
came
back
to
be
best
man
at
wedding
i
still
liked
him
awfully
well
but
i
could
see
that
my
ideals
had
changed
and
that
they
did
fit
him
any
moah
the
feathahs
fit
the
falcon
still
i
do
know
maybe
if
we
had
been
thrown
togethah
a
great
deal
from
the
time
i
first
met
him
it
might
have
been
different
but
as
i
say
absence
made
a
sawt
of
wall
between
us
and
we
seem
to
be
growing
farthah
and
farthah
apart
and
now
you
sure
he
not
the
one
the
stars
have
destined
for
you
perfectly
suah
she
answered
with
a
laugh
then
leaning
back
in
the
chimney
corner
again
opened
the
third
letter
the
envelope
slipped
to
the
floor
as
she
read
and
stooping
over
to
return
it
he
saw
quite
unintentionally
that
it
bore
a
south
american
stamp
she
was
reading
so
intently
that
she
did
not
notice
when
he
laid
it
in
her
lap
but
as
soon
as
she
finished
she
tossed
it
into
the
fire
without
a
word
her
face
flushed
and
her
eyes
had
an
angry
light
in
them
as
she
caught
his
grave
look
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
a
careless
little
laugh
to
hide
the
awkward
pause
and
then
said
lightly
i
think
mammy
eastah
fortune
will
come
true
there
wo
be
any
prince
in
my
why
wait
till
i
get
the
and
i
tell
you
she
was
back
in
a
moment
with
the
popper
and
several
ears
of
corn
which
she
divided
with
rob
and
started
to
shell
into
the
big
dish
which
she
placed
on
the
floor
between
them
she
shelled
in
silence
a
moment
or
two
it
this
wintah
in
society
that
given
me
that
opinion
she
said
finally
the
view
i
had
of
it
through
my
hildegarde
mirror
the
knights
have
come
riding
lots
of
them
and
maybe
among
them
i
might
have
found
my
prince
in
disguise
but
the
shadows
of
the
world
blurred
everything
out
heah
in
the
country
i
grown
up
believing
that
it
a
kind
honest
old
world
i
seen
only
its
good
side
i
took
my
conception
of
married
life
from
mothah
and
papa
jack
doctah
shelby
and
aunt
alicia
and
yoah
fathah
and
mothah
they
made
me
think
that
marriage
is
a
great
strong
sanctuary
built
on
a
rock
that
no
storm
can
hurt
and
no
trouble
move
but
this
wintah
i
found
that
that
kind
of
marriage
has
grown
out
of
fashion
it
something
to
jest
about
and
it
a
mattah
of
scandal
and
divorce
and
unhappiness
sometimes
it
made
me
the
tales
i
heard
and
the
things
i
saw
i
came
to
little
mary
ware
conclusion
that
it
safah
to
be
an
old
maid
illustration
she
poured
the
corn
into
the
popper
and
began
to
shake
it
over
the
red
coals
drawing
a
low
stool
nearer
the
fire
she
poured
the
corn
into
the
popper
and
began
to
shake
it
over
the
red
coals
it
dreadful
to
be
disillusioned
said
rob
smiling
at
her
serious
face
that
one
reason
why
i
keep
so
from
the
madding
crowd
my
old
friends
have
been
good
about
remembering
me
with
invitations
and
i
been
sorely
tempted
to
accept
some
of
them
just
to
see
what
kind
of
a
show
was
going
on
but
i
could
accept
one
and
refuse
another
and
i
could
afford
to
go
in
wholesale
carriages
and
flowers
and
the
bummed
up
feeling
that
follows
make
it
too
expensive
for
a
poor
man
like
me
it
nearly
over
now
i
suppose
anyway
yes
the
fancy
dress
ball
on
valentine
night
will
be
the
last
big
thing
befoah
lent
who
is
to
be
your
escort
mistah
whitlow
probably
he
has
asked
me
yet
but
he
saw
aunt
jane
this
mawning
and
told
her
not
to
let
me
make
any
engagement
for
he
was
coming
to
ask
me
as
soon
as
i
got
back
to
town
monday
bartrom
whitlow
exclaimed
rob
shifting
his
easy
lounging
position
to
an
upright
one
and
looking
very
stern
lloyd
you
do
mean
to
say
you
going
with
man
he
is
fit
to
be
invited
to
decent
people
houses
much
less
fit
to
shake
hands
with
their
daughters
some
of
the
others
are
bad
enough
goodness
knows
but
he
is
the
limit
you
simply
ca
go
with
him
well
you
need
so
exclaimed
lloyd
with
a
little
pout
as
if
she
resented
his
dictatorial
tone
secretly
it
pleased
her
for
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
she
had
heard
it
rather
than
let
you
go
with
him
i
accept
my
invitation
and
take
you
myself
what
a
sweet
spirit
laughed
lloyd
teasingly
i
certainly
feel
flattered
at
the
way
you
put
it
and
i
appreciate
the
great
sacrifice
you
willing
to
make
for
my
sake
of
i
want
to
go
with
mistah
whitlow
if
that
the
kind
of
man
he
is
but
it
seems
rathah
late
in
the
day
to
raise
a
row
he
called
on
me
several
times
this
wintah
and
sent
me
flowahs
and
danced
with
me
just
as
he
does
with
all
the
othah
girls
i
know
aunt
jane
believes
he
is
all
right
because
she
is
very
particulah
about
my
company
i
ca
see
any
way
to
get
out
of
going
with
him
as
long
as
she
given
him
to
undahstand
that
i
would
but
for
me
to
hold
you
to
yoah
offah
and
make
you
make
a
martyr
of
yoahself
on
the
altah
of
friendship
you
know
very
well
lloyd
sherman
fellow
would
count
it
martyrdom
to
escort
the
most
popular
débutante
of
the
season
to
the
last
great
function
she
opened
her
eyes
wide
astonished
at
such
an
unusual
thing
as
a
compliment
from
rob
oh
i
just
quoting
he
added
to
tease
her
that
what
i
heard
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
yours
call
you
on
the
car
this
evening
but
in
dead
earnest
too
my
offer
is
a
sincere
one
very
well
responded
lloyd
quickly
i
hold
you
to
it
i
suppose
you
seriously
considahed
it
you
have
to
go
in
fancy
costume
you
know
his
face
showed
plainly
that
he
had
not
thought
how
much
his
offer
involved
but
after
an
instant
hesitation
he
made
a
wry
grimace
and
laughed
that
all
right
i
die
game
i
have
been
to
anything
for
two
years
but
i
see
you
through
on
this
deal
never
desert
micawber
name
the
character
i
to
represent
and
i
get
the
costume
i
think
a
teddy
beah
would
be
most
in
keeping
if
you
going
to
glowah
and
growl
the
way
you
did
a
moment
ago
or
anything
fierce
and
furious
bluebeard
for
instance
that
would
be
fine
and
i
carry
a
bloody
key
and
you
can
drag
me
around
by
the
hair
as
an
object
lesson
to
all
thoughtless
girls
who
weave
their
mantles
to
fit
unworthy
shouldahs
instead
of
using
their
yah
sticks
to
do
it
right
that
old
tale
seems
to
worry
you
a
lot
lloyd
it
does
she
confessed
i
thought
about
it
every
day
this
wintah
now
this
is
all
ready
for
the
salt
and
buttah
she
added
as
the
last
grain
in
the
wire
cage
burst
into
snowy
bloom
i
take
it
ovah
to
the
old
gentlemen
while
it
hot
you
can
be
popping
the
next
lot
while
gone
sherman
joined
them
presently
and
the
question
of
costumes
was
settled
there
no
use
of
yoah
going
to
any
expense
for
one
said
lloyd
with
her
usual
delicate
consideration
there
are
trunkfuls
of
lovely
things
still
in
the
attic
come
ovah
next
week
and
we
look
through
them
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
old
intimacy
was
in
a
measure
resumed
for
several
calls
were
necessary
to
complete
the
arrangements
for
valentine
night
that
those
arrangements
were
highly
satisfactory
might
have
been
inferred
from
the
account
of
the
affair
which
appeared
in
the
society
columns
next
day
in
which
miss
sherman
and
mr
rob
moore
were
awarded
the
palm
for
the
most
unique
and
striking
costumes
they
had
gone
as
bluebeard
and
his
beautiful
fatima
it
was
the
crowning
good
time
of
the
season
lloyd
declared
for
rob
under
cover
of
his
disguise
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
with
all
his
old
zest
and
when
rob
tried
nobody
could
be
better
company
than
he
after
that
he
fell
into
the
way
of
an
occasional
call
at
the
locusts
he
was
too
busy
to
spare
many
evenings
but
when
lloyd
came
back
to
the
valley
nearly
every
sunday
afternoon
was
spent
in
their
old
way
taking
long
tramps
together
through
the
quiet
country
lanes
and
winter
woods
chapter
xiii
the
miracle
of
blossoming
the
beginning
of
lent
was
the
end
of
all
the
social
gaieties
and
most
of
the
girls
who
had
flittered
through
the
season
with
lloyd
fluttered
away
like
a
bevy
of
scattered
butterflies
to
various
resorts
on
the
florida
coast
kitty
departed
to
make
her
visit
to
gay
in
san
antonio
katie
mallard
went
with
an
invalid
aunt
to
biloxi
and
lloyd
came
back
to
the
country
she
was
almost
as
much
alone
as
she
had
been
that
winter
when
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
return
to
warwick
hall
after
the
christmas
vacation
true
allison
was
at
home
after
her
interesting
trip
abroad
with
the
macintyres
and
lloyd
spent
many
hours
at
the
beeches
but
raleigh
claiborne
sister
from
washington
was
there
on
a
visit
part
of
the
time
and
raleigh
himself
made
several
flying
trips
and
although
allison
engagement
made
her
doubly
interesting
to
the
younger
girls
it
seemed
to
rise
up
as
a
sort
of
wall
between
them
and
their
old
intimacy
she
had
so
many
new
interests
now
that
she
did
not
enter
quite
so
heartily
into
the
old
ones
so
it
came
about
that
lloyd
fell
quite
naturally
into
her
former
habit
of
dropping
in
to
see
bisbee
and
apwell
and
all
the
other
old
ladies
who
welcomed
her
with
open
arms
one
blowy
afternoon
in
march
she
took
her
embroidery
and
went
to
sit
with
bisbee
awhile
beside
the
window
that
walton
had
laughingly
dubbed
the
window
in
thrums
the
old
lady
growing
chatty
and
confidential
over
her
seemed
so
unusually
companionable
that
lloyd
remarked
it
really
seems
as
if
i
catching
up
to
you
all
bisbee
as
i
get
oldah
everybody
else
gets
youngah
why
this
wintah
mothah
has
been
just
like
a
sistah
i
had
no
idea
she
could
be
so
much
fun
we
do
everything
togethah
now
i
help
with
the
housekeeping
so
that
she
can
hurry
through
with
it
early
in
the
mawning
and
then
we
practise
piano
and
harp
or
she
plays
the
accompaniments
for
my
songs
and
then
we
read
french
awhile
and
we
go
for
long
walks
and
we
discuss
every
subject
undah
the
sun
just
as
betty
and
i
used
to
do
and
we
plan
things
to
do
in
the
deliciously
long
cosy
evenings
surprises
you
know
for
grandfathah
and
papa
jack
i
believe
i
enjoying
this
of
my
yeah
bettah
than
the
first
bisbee
looked
out
of
the
window
wistfully
at
nothing
that
the
way
that
it
used
to
be
here
when
daughter
was
at
home
she
sighed
sometimes
i
think
if
i
had
the
planning
of
the
universe
have
fixed
it
differently
just
when
your
little
girl
is
grown
up
to
be
a
comfort
and
a
joy
and
the
best
company
in
the
world
some
man
steps
in
and
takes
her
away
from
you
i
had
daughter
to
myself
only
one
short
year
after
she
got
through
school
then
she
married
of
course
it
would
have
been
selfish
to
have
stood
in
the
way
of
her
happiness
yet
she
shook
her
head
with
another
sigh
and
left
the
sentence
unfinished
i
have
often
wondered
how
i
could
have
stood
it
if
her
marriage
had
been
an
unhappy
one
like
poor
amy
cadwell
you
know
her
only
slightly
answered
lloyd
recalling
a
face
that
always
aroused
her
interest
a
face
with
thin
compressed
lips
and
watchful
defiant
eyes
that
seemed
to
have
grown
so
from
the
long
guarding
of
a
family
skeleton
it
was
not
gossip
the
way
bisbee
told
the
story
only
the
plain
recital
of
a
sad
bit
of
human
history
that
had
fallen
under
her
observation
the
cloud
of
it
rested
on
lloyd
face
as
she
listened
that
the
worst
thing
about
growing
up
she
exclaimed
bitterly
when
bisbee
paused
the
finding
out
that
everybody
is
good
and
happy
as
i
used
to
think
they
were
lately
just
these
last
few
months
that
i
been
out
in
society
i
heard
so
much
of
people
jealousies
and
rivalries
and
meannesses
and
insincerity
that
i
sometimes
be
tempted
to
doubt
everybody
if
it
were
not
for
my
own
family
and
some
of
the
people
out
in
this
little
old
valley
that
i
trusted
all
my
life
there
minnie
wayland
whose
engagement
was
announced
last
month
to
mistah
maybrick
i
do
see
how
she
dares
marry
when
her
own
fathah
and
mothah
made
such
a
failure
of
it
that
they
ca
live
togethah
and
mistah
maybrick
wife
got
a
divorce
from
him
on
account
of
some
dreadful
scandal
the
papahs
were
full
of
i
could
go
up
and
wish
her
joy
when
the
othah
girls
did
she
talked
about
it
in
such
a
flippant
mattah
of
business
way
as
if
millions
atoned
for
everything
one
of
the
girls
laughed
at
me
for
taking
it
so
seriously
and
said
that
matches
are
made
in
heaven
nowadays
and
that
i
have
to
get
ovah
my
puritanical
notions
and
ideals
if
i
expected
to
keep
up
with
the
set
i
thought
for
awhile
that
maybe
it
was
only
the
set
who
are
that
way
but
what
you
just
told
me
about
cadwell
and
what
i
heard
lately
about
several
families
right
in
our
own
little
neighbahhood
shows
that
it
a
bad
old
world
and
these
yeahs
i
been
thinking
it
so
good
i
been
blind
and
ignorant
i
suppose
it
for
the
best
but
i
sorry
sometimes
that
my
eyes
have
been
opened
bisbee
sighed
again
at
her
vehemence
and
then
quite
unexpectedly
piped
up
in
a
thin
tremulous
voice
with
one
of
the
songs
of
her
youth
in
a
high
minor
key
and
full
of
quavers
it
was
so
ridiculous
that
they
both
laughed
sat
beneath
a
hollow
tree
the
blast
it
hollow
blew
i
thought
upon
the
hollow
world
and
all
its
hollow
crew
ambition
and
its
hollow
schemes
the
hollow
hopes
we
follow
the
world
and
all
its
hollow
dreams
all
hollow
hollow
hollow
that
the
way
it
seems
to
you
now
she
said
it
the
reaction
but
you
must
let
it
make
you
pessimistic
when
you
get
to
feeling
like
that
you
have
to
do
like
old
abraham
did
quit
looking
at
all
the
sinners
in
sodom
and
hunt
around
for
the
ten
good
men
a
whole
row
of
lessons
rose
up
in
bisbee
mind
she
had
taught
a
class
for
thirty
years
in
the
stone
church
whose
spire
she
could
see
from
her
window
and
lloyd
was
used
to
her
startling
and
unexpected
application
of
scripture
texts
or
better
still
she
continued
turn
your
back
on
entire
sodom
and
look
away
to
the
plains
where
the
faithful
pitched
their
tents
the
world
is
full
of
that
kind
of
people
as
it
was
then
the
faithful
who
never
join
themselves
to
the
idols
of
the
heathen
but
who
tend
their
flocks
and
live
good
peaceful
lives
and
in
all
their
journeyings
wherever
they
go
an
altar
to
the
it
the
marriages
that
are
founded
on
rock
that
never
fall
she
added
reverently
her
mind
skipping
from
the
of
genesis
to
the
wise
builder
in
the
parables
with
the
ease
of
long
practice
the
rain
descended
and
the
floods
came
and
the
winds
blew
and
beat
upon
that
house
and
it
fell
not
for
it
was
founded
upon
a
sometimes
just
the
wife
part
is
built
on
it
she
the
only
one
that
raises
the
altar
sometimes
the
man
is
the
one
of
course
that
better
than
all
being
on
the
sand
and
saves
many
a
marriage
from
being
the
wreck
it
would
have
been
if
they
left
god
out
of
it
altogether
there
i
never
did
think
it
all
out
in
words
quite
as
straight
and
clear
and
convincing
to
myself
before
but
i
often
had
the
idea
come
to
me
when
i
be
sitting
in
church
looking
at
old
judge
moore
white
head
in
the
front
pew
and
thinking
of
the
trouble
had
the
sorrow
and
accidents
and
misfortune
that
have
beat
on
house
and
his
faith
standing
up
bigger
and
stronger
than
ever
even
his
wife
death
could
shake
it
here
she
paused
to
lean
nearer
the
window
and
nod
and
smile
at
some
one
driving
past
the
house
it
agnes
waring
she
explained
as
lloyd
looked
up
too
late
or
agnes
bond
i
should
say
i
never
can
remember
to
call
her
that
although
she
been
married
over
two
years
now
a
happy
marriage
if
ever
there
was
one
the
good
sort
like
the
judge
for
they
both
of
the
faithful
and
do
you
know
my
dear
she
continued
lightly
i
shall
always
hold
you
responsible
for
that
it
was
your
making
such
a
picture
out
of
agnes
at
that
martha
washington
affair
that
brought
her
out
of
her
shell
and
gave
john
bond
a
chance
to
discover
her
miss
sarah
thinks
so
too
by
the
way
she
was
here
yesterday
and
she
told
me
that
she
has
about
consented
to
break
up
housekeeping
and
go
to
live
with
agnes
it
so
lonely
for
her
since
poor
miss
marietta
died
yes
i
know
said
lloyd
softly
thinking
of
the
happy
release
that
had
come
to
miss
marietta
only
the
week
before
now
there
was
another
case
resumed
bisbee
nobody
who
saw
her
lying
there
in
that
beautiful
dress
that
was
to
have
been
her
wedding
gown
and
with
that
wonderful
smile
lighting
up
her
face
could
doubt
what
sort
of
a
foundation
she
and
murray
cathright
built
on
that
was
a
love
that
outlasted
time
and
reached
past
even
death
into
eternity
itself
so
do
you
go
to
doubting
that
it
does
exist
any
more
my
dear
lloyd
made
one
more
call
on
the
way
home
stopping
in
at
the
with
a
magazine
which
bisbee
had
asked
her
to
leave
oddly
enough
the
conversation
turned
to
the
same
subject
that
she
and
bisbee
had
been
discussing
but
she
went
away
in
a
very
different
mood
from
the
one
in
which
she
left
the
first
place
old
apwall
irritated
her
he
was
in
one
of
his
sprightly
facetious
humours
when
he
delighted
in
making
personal
remarks
in
a
teasing
way
well
my
little
lady
he
began
i
hear
you
had
a
whole
string
of
admirers
dangling
in
your
wake
this
last
year
oh
you
need
deny
it
he
added
shaking
a
finger
at
her
in
a
way
he
considered
playful
heard
the
gossip
about
that
young
texas
fellow
and
that
man
from
the
north
who
nearly
wore
out
his
private
car
coming
down
to
see
you
every
and
that
old
duck
from
cincinnati
that
you
refused
refused
them
all
oh
yes
you
did
though
we
heard
about
it
but
you
must
remember
the
story
of
the
lass
who
went
through
the
forest
looking
for
a
straight
stick
she
kept
throwing
them
away
and
throwing
them
away
getting
harder
to
please
at
every
step
until
she
gone
through
the
whole
forest
and
had
to
pick
up
a
crooked
one
at
the
last
he
laughed
childishly
at
his
own
tale
look
out
that
you
do
get
a
crooked
stick
apwall
broke
in
sourly
that
about
all
there
is
left
lying
around
to
choose
from
these
days
to
notion
but
land
sakes
alexander
quit
teasing
the
child
you
talk
as
if
all
her
chances
are
gone
by
and
that
she
doomed
to
be
an
old
maid
the
happiest
lot
of
all
say
for
there
no
man
living
but
has
some
crook
in
him
and
most
of
are
all
crookedness
she
darted
a
warlike
glance
in
his
direction
lloyd
left
as
soon
as
she
could
get
away
politely
wondering
how
they
had
heard
so
much
of
her
affairs
she
had
refused
both
proposals
but
she
did
know
that
any
one
outside
the
family
knew
anything
about
it
she
wondered
now
if
she
had
been
over
particular
for
the
crook
that
apwall
insisted
was
in
every
man
was
only
a
slight
one
in
the
case
of
the
owner
of
the
private
car
principally
a
matter
of
little
refinements
of
speech
and
appearance
which
one
had
a
right
to
expect
of
a
man
in
his
position
and
whose
lack
argued
to
a
dainty
girl
like
lloyd
some
corresponding
coarseness
of
nature
she
had
seen
the
other
man
slightly
intoxicated
one
night
at
a
theatre
party
and
could
never
quite
forget
the
maudlin
smile
with
which
he
poured
out
complimentary
speeches
by
the
wholesale
the
conversation
at
the
apwalls
brought
back
two
very
disagreeable
occasions
that
she
did
not
care
to
remember
and
she
made
up
her
mind
as
she
walked
rapidly
along
towards
home
that
it
would
be
many
a
day
before
she
went
back
there
they
always
gave
her
a
gloomy
impression
of
life
the
roads
were
so
muddy
that
she
had
to
take
to
the
railroad
track
stepping
from
one
to
another
to
avoid
the
sharp
cinders
between
presently
she
found
herself
walking
along
the
rail
as
she
and
betty
used
to
do
on
the
way
to
school
balancing
themselves
with
outstretched
arms
and
counting
how
many
steps
they
could
take
without
slipping
off
that
was
the
way
she
and
rob
had
taken
their
walk
the
week
before
it
had
been
too
muddy
to
go
anywhere
save
along
the
track
and
they
had
walked
the
for
two
miles
in
the
face
of
a
keen
march
wind
it
was
soft
and
balmy
fluttering
her
hair
and
skirts
in
a
playful
way
wholly
unlike
the
boisterous
flapping
with
which
it
had
ushered
in
the
month
as
she
went
along
she
peered
into
fence
corners
and
up
at
the
budding
branches
happy
over
every
sign
of
spring
if
the
roads
were
dry
enough
by
the
end
of
the
week
she
and
rob
intended
to
take
a
long
tramp
through
tanglewood
in
search
of
wild
flowers
anemones
harebells
and
spiderwort
foxgloves
and
violets
she
knew
them
all
and
the
haunts
where
they
came
the
earliest
she
rarely
gathered
them
but
went
from
one
to
another
for
a
glimpse
of
their
shy
faces
welcoming
them
as
she
would
old
friends
lloyd
loved
the
woods
like
an
indian
and
one
of
the
most
satisfactory
things
about
companionship
was
that
he
enjoyed
them
in
the
same
way
often
they
tramped
along
scarcely
saying
a
word
a
mile
finding
the
vibrant
silences
of
the
wood
better
than
speech
and
their
mutual
pleasure
in
them
sufficient
after
the
winter
in
town
which
had
been
an
unusually
cold
and
severe
one
lloyd
longed
for
the
beginning
of
spring
and
from
the
call
of
the
first
robin
and
the
budding
of
the
first
spent
as
much
time
as
possible
out
of
doors
april
came
in
with
a
week
of
sunny
days
which
hurried
everything
into
luxuriant
leafage
and
bud
when
rob
came
over
one
warm
day
for
his
usual
sunday
afternoon
walk
the
whole
world
seemed
so
near
the
verge
of
bursting
into
full
bloom
that
the
very
air
was
aquiver
with
its
secrets
faint
delicious
odours
stole
up
from
the
moist
earth
and
the
green
growing
things
that
crowded
up
out
of
it
even
the
old
locusts
conscious
of
a
hidden
wealth
of
sweetness
which
was
soon
to
make
a
glory
of
their
gnarled
branches
nodded
in
sympathy
with
all
that
was
young
and
riotous
there
were
so
many
things
to
discover
near
at
hand
that
lloyd
and
rob
sauntered
about
the
place
first
before
starting
farther
afield
there
were
spring
beauties
covering
the
little
knolls
in
the
pasture
like
a
fall
of
rosy
snow
there
were
violets
down
by
the
and
early
columbines
starting
out
from
the
crevices
of
the
rockery
holding
up
slender
stems
whereon
by
and
bye
their
airy
blossoms
would
poise
like
a
flock
of
butterflies
lloyd
happy
over
every
tiny
frond
she
found
unfolding
itself
in
the
fern
bed
and
every
yellow
dandelion
that
added
its
mite
of
gold
to
the
young
year
coffers
was
so
absorbed
in
her
quest
that
she
did
not
notice
any
difference
in
rob
manner
he
walked
along
beside
her
saying
little
but
with
the
same
air
of
repressed
eagerness
that
the
whole
april
day
seemed
to
share
as
if
like
the
locusts
he
too
was
conscious
of
some
inner
wealth
of
bloom
some
secret
happiness
whose
time
for
sharing
with
the
spring
had
not
yet
come
once
when
he
answered
her
enthusiastic
discovery
of
a
snowdrop
with
only
an
monosyllable
she
glanced
up
at
him
curiously
there
was
such
a
light
in
his
eyes
and
such
an
unwonted
tenderness
in
his
expression
that
she
wondered
what
he
could
be
thinking
about
across
the
pasture
they
went
down
through
the
orchard
where
the
were
turning
pink
and
the
clusters
of
tiny
white
plum
buds
were
already
calling
the
bees
and
around
again
to
the
at
the
back
of
the
house
it
was
a
sweet
way
and
lloyd
bubbling
over
with
the
spirit
of
the
hour
began
to
hum
a
happy
little
tune
suddenly
she
stopped
short
in
the
path
turning
her
head
slightly
with
the
alert
motion
of
a
young
fawn
what
is
it
that
smells
so
delicious
she
demanded
it
almost
heavenly
it
so
sweet
then
after
another
long
indrawn
breath
think
it
was
if
it
were
any
place
but
out
heah
on
the
edge
of
the
they
be
way
out
heah
it
must
be
some
rare
kind
of
wild
flowah
we
nevah
discovered
leaving
the
path
they
both
began
searching
through
the
underbrush
pushing
aside
the
dead
leaves
and
stooping
now
and
then
to
examine
some
plant
that
did
not
seem
entirely
familiar
i
positive
it
a
flowah
declared
lloyd
closing
her
eyes
and
drawing
in
another
breath
of
the
faint
elusive
fragrance
only
a
white
flowah
could
have
such
an
ethereal
odah
it
makes
you
think
of
white
things
does
it
snow
crystals
and
angel
wings
oh
they
she
cried
the
next
instant
stooping
over
a
bed
of
green
from
which
rob
was
raking
the
dead
leaves
with
a
stick
and
do
you
remembah
now
she
cried
her
eyes
like
eager
stars
as
she
recalled
the
incident
planted
them
heah
ourselves
yeahs
ago
i
remembah
digging
up
a
whole
apronful
of
some
thrifty
green
things
out
of
the
flowah
bed
undah
yoah
mothah
window
and
lugging
them
ovah
home
all
the
way
from
oaklea
you
planted
them
in
this
place
for
me
because
we
thought
we
build
a
heah
but
aftahwards
we
changed
our
minds
and
built
it
by
the
swing
it
seems
to
me
i
do
have
a
faint
recollection
of
something
of
that
sort
rob
answered
i
know
i
had
a
row
with
unc
andy
once
for
digging
up
some
of
his
pet
borders
and
transplanting
them
over
here
but
i
did
know
they
were
lilies
i
suppose
we
did
know
because
we
nevah
happened
to
wandah
this
way
aftahward
when
they
were
in
bloom
she
continued
seating
herself
beside
them
and
parting
the
thickest
sheaths
of
green
to
reveal
the
perfect
white
flowers
hidden
away
among
them
throwing
aside
her
hat
she
bent
over
to
thrust
her
face
into
their
midst
revelling
in
the
purity
and
exquisite
fragrance
there
nothing
like
them
she
exclaimed
so
intent
on
the
beauty
of
the
tiny
white
bells
that
she
did
not
see
the
expression
with
which
rob
was
looking
down
on
her
there
was
a
likeness
between
the
two
he
was
thinking
the
girl
and
the
white
white
blossoms
they
seemed
spiritually
akin
she
touched
one
of
the
racemes
softly
it
a
miracle
is
it
she
said
in
a
low
reverent
tone
a
miracle
that
anything
so
sweet
and
white
and
perfect
can
suddenly
come
into
being
like
this
it
must
have
made
those
old
lily
bulbs
wondah
at
themselves
the
first
time
they
unfolded
and
woke
up
to
find
that
such
a
heavenly
thing
had
happened
to
them
their
hearts
filled
with
this
unearthly
beauty
and
sweetness
do
you
suppose
it
made
the
whole
world
seem
different
that
they
not
yet
done
wondering
ovah
the
surprise
and
joy
of
it
she
said
it
with
a
shy
as
if
he
would
laugh
at
such
a
childish
fancy
then
she
looked
up
startled
at
the
unexpected
intensity
of
his
answer
i
it
made
the
whole
world
different
he
said
in
such
a
strange
exultant
voice
that
she
hardly
knew
it
for
rob
dropping
to
one
knee
beside
her
he
singled
out
one
of
the
lilies
just
beginning
to
burst
from
its
sheath
and
folded
it
close
shut
again
in
its
green
leaves
look
he
said
in
the
same
exultant
voice
that
the
way
i
been
for
years
with
something
hidden
away
in
my
heart
unrecognized
at
first
then
its
sweetness
only
at
and
i
kept
it
hid
and
i
thought
never
to
tell
you
but
this
morning
in
church
it
happened
to
this
miracle
of
blossoming
i
was
sitting
looking
at
you
as
done
a
thousand
times
before
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
came
over
me
just
as
sweet
and
unexpected
as
the
bursting
of
these
lilies
the
knowledge
that
life
is
dear
and
the
world
beautiful
because
are
in
it
i
think
i
always
held
the
thought
of
you
in
my
heart
lloyd
but
it
has
come
to
such
full
flower
now
dear
i
could
hide
it
from
you
long
even
if
i
tried
it
seems
to
me
now
that
all
of
my
life
must
have
been
a
gradual
growing
up
for
this
one
thing
to
love
you
then
his
face
glowing
with
an
eager
gladness
that
almost
transfigured
it
paled
a
little
before
the
mute
misery
in
hers
oh
rob
she
stammered
finding
it
hard
to
believe
that
she
had
heard
aright
tell
me
that
i
always
loved
you
deahly
but
not
way
then
as
she
saw
all
the
light
fade
out
of
his
eyes
and
his
face
settle
into
grim
stern
lines
she
reached
out
both
hands
crying
oh
you
deah
old
bobby
i
would
have
had
it
happen
for
the
world
i
ca
to
hurt
you
this
way
her
eyes
filled
and
two
big
tears
splashed
down
on
the
hands
she
had
thrust
impulsively
into
his
with
a
gentleness
that
stirred
her
even
more
than
his
words
had
done
he
bent
and
touched
them
with
his
lips
never
mind
dear
he
said
with
a
great
tenderness
that
brought
a
sob
up
into
her
throat
do
think
of
it
any
more
if
it
makes
you
unhappy
if
you
could
have
loved
me
it
would
have
been
heaven
but
as
you
we
wo
talk
about
it
any
more
and
i
still
have
my
miracle
nothing
can
change
that
she
could
not
answer
the
tears
came
crowding
so
fast
and
as
they
walked
back
towards
the
house
together
all
the
brightness
seemed
to
have
dropped
out
of
the
april
day
the
sweetness
of
the
lilies
still
followed
them
however
and
when
she
glanced
around
wondering
why
she
saw
that
rob
still
held
the
one
he
had
knelt
to
pick
for
her
he
twirled
it
absently
in
his
fingers
but
as
they
parted
at
the
steps
he
held
it
out
to
her
with
a
smile
so
tender
and
full
of
understanding
that
another
sob
came
up
in
her
throat
and
she
took
it
without
a
word
chapter
xiv
the
royal
mantle
the
week
that
followed
was
an
unhappy
one
for
lloyd
everywhere
she
went
it
seemed
to
her
that
were
thrust
into
her
face
on
the
way
to
town
people
got
on
the
car
at
nearly
every
station
with
great
bunches
of
them
that
they
were
carrying
to
offices
or
to
their
friends
the
florists
windows
were
full
of
them
men
passed
her
on
the
street
wearing
them
on
their
coats
and
even
the
little
who
waited
on
her
at
the
ribbon
counter
had
them
stuck
in
her
belt
when
she
called
at
bisbee
there
was
a
box
of
them
growing
on
her
and
at
home
the
whole
house
was
permeated
by
the
fragrance
that
floated
out
from
the
great
crystal
bowl
on
the
library
table
she
could
not
get
away
from
them
and
they
kept
rob
constantly
in
her
thoughts
she
told
herself
that
she
had
never
known
anything
quite
so
considerate
and
sweet
as
the
way
he
had
taken
her
answer
the
more
she
thought
of
his
quick
putting
aside
of
self
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
unhappy
the
more
it
grieved
her
that
he
must
be
disappointed
she
did
not
see
him
again
until
the
following
sunday
he
came
into
church
behind
the
old
judge
and
moore
and
lloyd
dropped
her
eyes
to
her
her
heart
in
such
a
flutter
that
it
sent
a
queer
little
tingle
all
over
her
she
was
afraid
to
meet
his
glance
for
fear
the
consciousness
of
their
last
meeting
would
send
the
telltale
red
to
her
face
in
the
pew
just
behind
the
moores
sat
katie
mallard
with
a
girl
from
frankfort
who
was
visiting
her
and
as
rob
took
his
seat
lloyd
saw
the
guest
pretty
eyes
fixed
inquiringly
on
him
then
she
whispered
something
to
katie
behind
her
fan
instantly
the
wonder
crossed
mind
what
the
newcomer
thought
of
him
and
then
she
wondered
how
he
would
appear
to
her
if
she
could
see
him
with
the
eyes
of
a
stranger
without
the
intimate
knowledge
their
long
acquaintance
had
given
her
she
stole
a
glance
in
his
direction
as
the
organist
pulled
out
the
stops
and
struck
the
opening
chords
of
the
voluntary
he
was
certainly
good
to
look
at
and
she
concluded
the
veriest
stranger
if
he
were
any
judge
at
all
of
such
things
must
see
at
a
glance
that
his
was
a
strong
character
that
he
would
scorn
to
do
a
dishonourable
thing
and
that
the
years
behind
him
were
clean
and
honest
then
with
a
start
she
realized
that
she
had
been
holding
him
up
to
her
silver
yardstick
and
that
he
not
only
met
its
three
requirements
but
went
far
beyond
he
had
family
social
position
everything
that
her
father
had
desired
for
her
save
wealth
and
she
remembered
how
earnestly
he
had
added
on
that
solemn
but
all
these
are
nothing
when
weighed
in
the
balance
with
the
love
of
an
honest
man
this
greatest
of
all
had
been
given
her
but
she
could
not
accept
because
well
she
did
know
why
but
probably
because
it
was
just
who
had
offered
it
and
she
could
think
of
as
being
the
one
the
stars
had
destined
for
her
a
boy
that
she
had
made
mud
pies
with
the
old
hildegarde
story
had
been
good
for
her
in
many
ways
but
it
had
made
the
prince
of
her
dreams
a
vague
personality
unlike
any
man
she
had
ever
met
she
had
never
put
into
words
even
to
herself
what
she
expected
him
to
be
like
but
the
shadowy
image
that
her
imagination
sometimes
held
up
had
no
flaw
like
ordinary
mortals
no
human
faults
and
failings
and
she
would
know
him
when
he
came
in
some
strange
mysterious
way
that
needed
no
speech
his
coming
would
be
heralded
like
hebe
her
ran
an
influence
sweet
that
bowed
my
heart
like
barley
the
congregation
rose
for
the
gloria
and
her
eyes
met
rob
for
one
instant
in
the
quick
lighting
of
his
face
she
had
a
revelation
of
all
that
his
miracle
of
blossoming
meant
to
him
then
he
flashed
her
a
reassuring
smile
that
seemed
to
say
never
mind
old
chum
we
go
on
just
as
we
always
done
that
she
had
interpreted
it
aright
lloyd
knew
when
he
came
that
afternoon
as
usual
and
proposed
a
walk
over
past
the
lindsey
cabin
he
seemed
to
have
put
himself
into
her
place
so
fully
that
he
understood
just
how
she
felt
towards
him
knew
that
it
hurt
her
to
have
to
withhold
the
one
great
thing
he
desired
and
that
his
friendship
was
still
as
dear
to
her
as
ever
so
with
a
fine
consideration
that
she
was
quick
to
appreciate
he
came
back
to
his
old
place
so
naturally
and
as
such
a
matter
of
course
that
it
put
her
at
her
ease
with
him
and
made
it
possible
for
her
to
ignore
the
episode
of
the
lilies
as
if
it
had
never
been
may
came
with
its
locust
blossoms
and
the
birthday
anniversary
that
made
her
old
and
twenty
one
of
her
gifts
was
a
beautiful
and
she
began
her
daily
rides
again
several
times
when
rob
could
arrange
to
leave
town
earlier
than
usual
he
rode
with
her
early
in
june
betty
wrote
that
she
was
going
up
into
the
pine
woods
of
maine
for
her
vacation
she
had
been
offered
a
position
to
teach
an
hour
a
day
in
a
sort
of
summer
school
a
girls
camp
and
the
position
had
too
many
advantages
to
refuse
she
would
be
back
in
time
for
a
week
or
ten
days
at
the
locusts
before
the
opening
of
the
fall
term
at
warwick
hall
lloyd
who
had
looked
forward
to
betty
companionship
for
the
entire
summer
was
sorely
disappointed
the
same
day
that
that
letter
came
rob
told
her
that
he
was
going
away
for
awhile
some
investments
his
father
had
made
years
ago
had
turned
out
to
be
worth
investigating
and
he
was
sure
he
could
dispose
of
them
advantageously
at
any
rate
he
was
going
to
birmingham
to
try
he
might
be
back
in
a
week
or
two
and
he
might
be
away
the
entire
month
of
june
if
betty
had
been
at
home
probably
lloyd
would
not
have
missed
him
at
all
but
because
she
had
to
take
so
many
of
her
walks
and
rides
alone
he
was
often
in
her
thoughts
i
ca
expect
to
have
every
summah
as
gay
as
last
one
was
she
said
to
herself
one
morning
as
she
busied
herself
about
her
room
changing
the
arrangement
of
the
pictures
she
leaned
over
to
dust
the
ones
above
her
low
bookcase
they
ran
in
a
long
panel
just
above
it
the
series
of
garden
fancies
that
leland
harcourt
had
suggested
it
was
on
a
june
morning
like
this
almost
a
year
ago
that
she
had
posed
for
some
of
them
in
doctor
shelby
old
garden
it
seemed
at
least
four
times
as
long
as
that
she
had
grown
so
much
older
and
wiser
she
stooped
to
look
again
at
the
picture
of
darby
and
joan
under
which
was
written
hand
in
hand
while
our
hair
is
gray
as
she
passed
her
duster
lightly
over
the
glass
which
covered
the
two
dear
old
faces
she
remembered
that
next
week
this
devoted
couple
were
to
celebrate
their
golden
wedding
and
that
she
had
promised
to
let
them
borrow
her
for
a
whole
week
before
to
help
with
the
preparations
an
hour
later
she
was
opening
the
gate
that
led
to
the
door
where
the
ugly
little
chinese
idol
still
kept
guard
and
held
it
open
she
found
shelby
out
on
her
cool
upper
piazza
behind
the
in
a
low
sewing
chair
she
was
stitching
daintily
away
on
a
bit
of
fine
linen
a
wristband
for
one
of
richard
shirts
she
explained
after
her
first
moments
of
delighted
greeting
and
i
go
right
on
with
it
for
i
making
him
a
set
all
by
hand
for
my
anniversary
present
to
him
he
always
been
so
proud
of
my
needlework
and
had
so
much
sentiment
for
the
things
i
made
myself
i
ca
begin
to
tell
you
how
glad
i
am
to
have
you
here
i
been
sitting
here
all
morning
thinking
that
if
my
little
alicia
had
lived
what
an
interest
she
would
have
taken
in
all
my
preparations
i
keep
forgetting
that
she
would
be
a
young
girl
like
you
it
alicia
granddaughter
who
would
have
been
your
age
it
took
only
a
question
or
two
to
open
the
gates
into
this
gentle
old
soul
happy
yesterdays
and
lloyd
listened
and
questioned
enjoying
the
quiet
romance
that
she
gathered
bit
by
bit
as
one
gathers
the
posies
of
an
old
garden
and
clasps
them
into
a
nosegay
aunt
alicia
she
asked
presently
were
you
at
the
time
that
you
were
making
no
mistake
did
you
have
any
doubts
or
misgivings
about
the
doctah
being
the
right
one
shelby
laughed
i
must
confess
that
i
was
a
very
silly
girl
who
had
read
so
many
sentimental
stories
that
my
head
was
full
of
dreams
of
some
faultless
being
who
should
appear
like
the
prince
to
the
sleeping
beauty
and
change
the
whole
world
for
me
with
a
kiss
it
was
a
long
time
before
i
could
recognize
him
in
the
disguise
of
a
poor
country
doctor
but
i
think
we
are
apt
to
be
that
way
about
most
things
in
life
my
dear
familiarity
disguises
the
real
worth
of
most
of
our
blessings
we
do
appreciate
them
till
we
are
forced
to
miss
them
for
awhile
but
what
finally
showed
you
persisted
lloyd
what
made
you
see
through
the
disguise
oh
my
dear
laughed
shelby
again
i
could
explain
a
thing
like
that
how
do
these
know
what
calls
them
to
open
or
the
tide
when
it
is
time
to
rise
they
it
i
suppose
they
just
that
is
the
way
it
was
with
me
lloyd
came
again
next
day
prepared
to
spend
the
week
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
who
enjoyed
the
visit
the
most
gentle
aunt
alicia
fluttered
around
hugging
the
sweet
pretence
to
her
heart
that
for
this
little
space
at
least
she
had
a
real
own
daughter
beside
her
hers
to
call
upon
for
any
service
that
the
little
alicia
would
have
gladly
tendered
the
old
doctor
spent
every
moment
he
could
spare
from
his
office
in
the
spacious
screened
porch
leading
from
the
kitchen
where
all
the
preparations
were
carried
gaily
forward
here
after
the
invitations
were
sent
lloyd
spent
her
time
under
her
supervision
the
old
satin
wedding
gown
was
brought
out
and
aired
and
pressed
and
slightly
altered
its
white
folds
had
turned
to
a
mellow
ivory
in
the
years
it
had
been
laid
away
just
as
the
sentiment
which
cherished
it
had
grown
deeper
and
richer
with
time
once
as
lloyd
intercepted
a
glance
the
old
doctor
exchanged
with
his
wife
as
they
brought
out
these
reminders
of
their
bridal
it
made
her
feel
that
she
was
touching
with
intimate
fingers
the
heart
of
a
sweet
and
tender
old
romance
from
the
yellowed
pages
of
an
old
diary
she
read
a
description
of
the
original
wedding
feast
and
with
an
enthusiasm
which
went
ahead
of
shelby
own
prepared
to
copy
it
in
every
detail
for
the
golden
wedding
jellies
and
cakes
and
salads
candied
and
rare
spiced
confections
that
had
graced
the
first
were
all
reproduced
for
this
great
occasion
lloyd
beat
eggs
and
shelled
nuts
and
stirred
icing
with
a
zest
while
she
planned
the
decorations
and
gave
orders
right
and
left
to
a
household
who
joyed
to
do
her
bidding
it
was
not
until
next
to
the
last
great
day
that
shelby
made
the
discovery
they
had
overlooked
a
certain
whose
recipe
was
missing
and
i
do
suppose
it
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
valley
she
mourned
unless
they
kept
phronie
moore
old
she
was
one
of
my
bridesmaids
and
she
made
it
with
her
own
hands
it
was
one
of
her
own
special
recipes
that
she
was
noted
for
and
i
would
have
lost
it
for
anything
you
know
the
judge
must
have
kept
it
alicia
the
old
doctor
gently
insisted
you
know
the
slightest
thing
she
ever
handled
was
sacred
to
him
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
anything
she
taken
so
much
pride
in
and
written
every
page
with
her
own
hands
as
you
say
would
be
preserved
no
doubt
his
can
find
it
for
you
without
the
least
trouble
even
if
she
could
i
would
want
to
borrow
it
began
shelby
but
lloyd
interrupted
briskly
i
fix
it
all
right
for
you
aunt
alicia
i
run
right
ovah
to
oaklea
as
soon
as
daphne
gets
this
in
the
oven
and
ask
moore
to
let
me
copy
the
recipe
for
you
so
that
is
how
it
came
about
that
late
that
afternoon
lloyd
opened
the
great
iron
gate
at
oaklea
and
following
the
familiar
path
under
the
giant
oaks
reached
the
house
to
which
she
had
long
been
a
stranger
rob
dog
a
fine
gordon
setter
came
out
with
a
boisterous
barking
but
seeing
who
it
was
leaped
up
licking
her
hands
and
wagging
a
friendly
welcome
it
seemed
as
if
rob
ought
to
be
somewhere
near
everything
about
the
place
suggested
him
a
familiar
gray
hat
lay
on
the
hall
table
his
beside
it
whither
the
coloured
maid
led
her
there
were
other
reminders
of
him
indian
clubs
and
a
tennis
racquet
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
and
a
cabinet
holding
the
various
collections
that
had
been
his
fads
from
time
to
time
come
in
here
dear
called
moore
from
the
depths
of
a
sleepy
hollow
chair
i
too
tired
to
move
so
i
knew
you
excuse
my
sending
down
for
you
to
come
it
was
rob
room
into
which
she
was
ushered
moore
held
out
both
cordial
hands
without
rising
and
drew
her
down
for
a
kiss
rob
coming
home
she
explained
so
of
course
everything
had
to
be
swept
and
garnished
for
so
grand
an
occasion
and
i
nearly
used
myself
up
making
things
fine
in
his
honour
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
it
the
first
time
he
been
away
since
the
dear
left
us
and
i
had
no
idea
four
weeks
could
be
such
an
age
i
so
excited
and
happy
over
his
coming
that
i
can
scarcely
talk
about
it
calmly
but
you
know
what
a
dear
good
son
my
adair
is
to
me
so
you
can
make
allowances
for
a
fond
mother
foolishness
it
was
some
moments
before
lloyd
had
an
opportunity
to
make
known
her
errand
apologizing
profusely
for
putting
her
to
any
exertion
when
she
was
so
tired
oh
it
no
trouble
answered
moore
i
think
i
know
right
where
to
put
my
hand
on
the
book
in
father
room
i
step
across
the
hall
and
see
left
to
herself
lloyd
gave
a
shy
glance
around
the
room
remembering
the
time
when
it
had
been
a
familiar
playground
but
now
she
had
an
embarrassed
sense
of
intruding
many
an
hour
she
had
spent
romping
in
it
while
mom
beck
and
dinah
gossiped
by
the
fire
they
had
had
their
menagerie
and
lions
den
in
that
curtained
alcove
here
on
the
floor
between
the
and
the
window
they
had
chalked
the
ring
for
their
marble
games
she
leaned
over
and
examined
the
floor
at
her
feet
with
a
smile
those
were
undoubtedly
the
dents
that
their
had
left
mom
beck
had
told
them
at
the
time
no
amount
of
polishing
could
ever
wipe
out
such
holes
the
little
tin
soldiers
that
used
to
stand
guard
on
the
had
given
place
to
other
things
now
the
that
had
carried
them
such
long
journeys
of
adventure
together
had
been
stabled
for
years
in
the
attic
at
the
locusts
college
trophies
and
pennants
hung
on
the
walls
a
rifle
and
a
shotgun
stood
in
the
corner
where
a
wooden
gun
and
a
toy
sword
used
to
stay
the
low
table
and
the
picture
books
had
given
place
to
a
massive
desk
and
rows
on
rows
of
heavy
volumes
bound
in
leather
then
she
recognized
several
things
belonging
to
a
later
period
there
was
the
case
she
made
him
the
day
he
bought
his
first
razor
she
had
been
so
proud
of
the
monogram
she
burnt
into
the
leather
it
looked
decidedly
amateurish
to
her
now
on
the
leather
couch
among
its
many
cushions
was
the
pillow
she
had
embroidered
in
his
fraternity
colours
and
sent
to
him
while
he
was
at
college
between
the
front
windows
where
the
desk
stood
and
just
above
it
ran
four
long
rows
of
photographs
set
in
narrow
panels
most
of
them
were
group
pictures
the
first
dating
back
to
the
time
of
her
first
and
ending
with
some
that
had
been
taken
the
week
of
eugenia
wedding
it
was
like
a
serial
story
of
all
their
good
times
and
hastily
changing
her
seat
she
leaned
her
elbows
on
the
desk
for
another
look
but
the
nearer
view
revealed
something
that
she
had
not
seen
at
the
first
glance
was
the
central
figure
of
every
group
it
was
face
that
one
noticed
first
laughing
back
from
every
picture
abashed
at
her
discovery
she
scuttled
back
to
her
former
seat
but
not
before
her
quick
glance
had
showed
her
another
photograph
on
the
desk
in
a
silver
frame
it
was
the
last
one
miss
marks
had
taken
of
her
in
her
commencement
gown
she
did
not
know
that
rob
had
one
of
them
she
had
not
given
it
to
him
moore
called
out
something
to
her
from
across
the
hall
and
as
she
turned
to
reply
she
faced
still
another
picture
of
herself
this
one
in
an
silver
locket
swinging
from
the
side
of
the
mirror
it
was
the
princess
winsome
with
the
dove
she
was
afraid
to
look
any
further
she
felt
like
an
eavesdropper
for
the
very
walls
were
calling
out
to
her
those
words
of
rob
that
she
had
been
trying
for
weeks
to
forget
all
my
life
seems
to
have
been
a
growing
up
for
this
one
thing
to
love
you
she
sprang
up
with
the
impulse
to
leave
the
room
to
get
away
from
these
telltale
voices
that
she
had
no
right
to
listen
to
but
just
then
moore
came
back
with
the
book
you
can
copy
it
here
at
the
desk
she
said
laying
out
a
sheet
of
paper
and
rob
big
pen
she
did
not
sit
down
while
lloyd
wrote
the
few
lines
but
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
back
of
the
chair
till
she
had
finished
then
she
said
with
an
amused
smile
i
want
to
show
you
something
funny
lloyd
i
came
across
it
this
morning
while
i
was
looking
over
some
old
things
of
rob
it
your
first
piece
of
needlework
you
made
it
over
here
one
rainy
day
under
mom
instructions
it
so
long
ago
i
suppose
you
forgotten
but
i
remember
that
rob
tried
to
make
one
too
and
stuck
his
fingers
so
often
that
he
cried
and
gave
it
up
and
you
gave
him
yours
to
comfort
him
opening
a
box
which
she
brought
from
some
drawer
she
took
out
a
sorry
little
all
puckered
and
drawn
its
long
straggling
stitches
scarcely
kept
in
place
the
cotton
with
which
it
was
stuffed
the
faded
blue
silk
was
streaked
and
dirty
as
if
it
had
been
used
for
a
at
some
stage
of
its
existence
and
the
pins
that
formed
the
crooked
letter
l
had
rusted
in
their
places
but
that
it
was
accounted
something
precious
one
could
see
from
the
way
in
which
it
was
tied
and
wrapped
and
carefully
put
away
in
this
box
by
itself
it
was
a
relief
to
lloyd
to
find
that
moore
did
not
attach
any
significance
to
the
fact
that
rob
thus
treasured
her
old
gift
she
only
laughed
and
said
he
was
like
her
in
that
regard
she
could
bear
to
throw
away
anything
connected
with
his
childhood
only
that
morning
she
had
come
across
the
little
blue
shoes
that
he
had
learned
to
walk
in
and
nearly
cried
over
them
they
recalled
so
plainly
those
happy
days
we
are
both
full
of
sentiment
for
old
things
she
continued
i
believe
it
will
hurt
him
nearly
as
much
as
me
if
we
decide
to
leave
oaklea
and
try
to
make
a
home
somewhere
else
leave
oaklea
repeated
lloyd
wonderingly
yes
rob
has
had
such
a
splendid
opening
offered
him
in
birmingham
that
he
has
been
strongly
tempted
to
move
there
oh
i
have
told
you
the
good
news
have
i
he
succeeded
in
selling
that
property
to
a
big
corporation
that
needed
it
to
extend
their
manufactories
and
was
able
to
get
such
a
fine
figure
for
it
that
now
he
can
give
up
that
horrid
grind
in
the
hardware
business
and
go
away
in
the
fall
for
the
last
year
of
his
law
course
he
has
studied
so
hard
with
his
grandfather
that
this
one
year
is
all
that
is
necessary
and
he
will
be
the
youngest
lawyer
to
be
admitted
to
the
louisville
bar
when
he
gets
through
his
grandfather
is
prouder
of
that
possibility
than
anything
else
connected
with
the
boy
but
about
your
going
away
began
lloyd
anxiously
when
she
had
expressed
proper
interest
in
the
news
oaklea
wo
be
the
same
place
with
strangahs
living
heah
i
ca
imagine
such
a
thing
it
is
settled
yet
moore
answered
cheerfully
and
then
rambled
on
to
some
other
topic
but
lloyd
heard
no
word
of
what
she
was
saying
a
sudden
panic
had
seized
her
at
the
possibility
of
rob
being
taken
out
of
her
life
for
ever
the
bare
thought
gave
her
a
sinking
of
the
heart
and
a
sense
of
desolation
such
as
a
little
child
might
have
at
being
left
alone
in
the
dark
as
she
sat
there
trying
to
imagine
how
it
would
seem
never
to
see
him
again
such
a
revelation
of
her
own
self
came
to
her
that
it
sent
the
colour
surging
up
in
her
face
and
set
her
heart
to
fluttering
like
a
startled
bird
she
knew
now
for
whom
she
had
been
weaving
all
these
years
this
moment
of
self
insight
had
torn
away
the
disguise
prince
had
come
into
his
kingdom
a
pause
in
moore
remarks
brought
the
embarrassing
knowledge
that
she
had
not
heard
the
question
whose
reply
was
being
waited
for
and
she
started
to
stammer
some
incoherent
excuse
when
a
shrill
whistle
from
below
made
them
both
start
the
familiar
sound
was
followed
by
a
joyous
barking
from
the
gordon
setter
and
then
rob
voice
called
gaily
where
are
you
mother
six
whole
hours
ahead
of
time
just
to
surprise
you
moore
sprang
up
all
her
weariness
forgotten
and
ran
to
meet
him
lloyd
stood
hesitating
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
she
did
want
to
intrude
on
this
meeting
yet
she
could
stay
there
in
his
room
the
room
that
babbled
his
secrets
and
reflected
him
on
every
side
like
a
mirror
still
hesitating
then
going
forward
and
halting
again
she
reached
the
landing
midway
on
the
stairs
and
saw
him
standing
with
his
arm
around
his
mother
who
had
forgotten
everything
else
save
the
joy
of
his
return
then
he
glanced
up
and
saw
her
standing
there
one
hand
on
the
polished
rail
and
her
white
dress
trailing
down
the
steps
behind
her
and
the
late
afternoon
sunshine
stealing
through
the
amber
medallion
window
above
her
rested
with
such
soft
touch
on
her
fair
hair
that
it
seemed
that
a
halo
of
dim
gold
surrounded
her
for
an
instant
he
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
and
stood
gazing
at
her
with
a
look
of
happy
wonder
as
if
this
were
only
another
vision
of
the
always
enshrined
in
his
heart
but
his
next
glance
showed
him
that
it
was
lloyd
in
reality
for
at
his
adoring
gaze
she
went
all
rosy
red
and
looked
away
in
shy
confusion
stopping
only
for
the
briefest
greeting
she
hurried
past
him
saying
that
aunt
alicia
was
waiting
and
the
wonderful
cake
would
be
done
in
time
that
his
mother
would
tell
him
about
it
and
she
see
him
at
the
wedding
what
happened
afterward
was
all
a
sort
of
golden
haze
to
lloyd
the
afternoon
of
the
anniversary
came
and
went
she
greeted
the
guests
who
came
in
a
constant
stream
with
their
gifts
and
good
wishes
she
sang
the
old
songs
when
they
asked
her
to
she
saw
that
every
one
was
served
to
the
sumptuous
refreshments
in
the
she
played
her
rôle
of
daughter
of
the
house
to
such
perfection
that
aunt
alicia
caught
her
hand
gratefully
every
time
she
passed
and
followed
her
with
loving
eyes
as
she
flitted
from
room
to
room
she
carried
away
the
impression
that
it
was
all
a
beautiful
sacred
occasion
for
the
whole
valley
bared
its
heart
for
that
little
space
to
show
its
love
for
the
good
doctor
who
for
half
a
century
had
been
its
standby
in
its
times
of
stress
and
anxiety
and
bitter
bereavement
yet
the
only
moment
that
stood
out
quite
clearly
was
the
one
when
rob
passed
down
the
receiving
line
and
stopped
for
a
word
about
the
perfect
june
day
and
how
sweet
the
bride
of
fifty
years
looked
in
her
satin
gown
and
white
roses
lloyd
had
answered
gaily
fluttering
her
fan
and
adjusting
the
slender
bracelet
on
her
arm
in
a
careless
way
but
she
had
not
looked
up
at
him
in
her
usual
straightforward
fashion
the
festivities
were
not
extended
into
the
evening
because
aunt
alicia
was
not
strong
the
invitations
were
only
for
the
afternoon
and
by
sundown
the
last
guest
had
departed
even
lloyd
went
saying
merrily
that
she
left
them
to
begin
their
second
honeymoon
but
that
she
would
be
back
next
morning
to
help
put
things
in
order
there
was
company
at
the
locusts
that
night
some
business
acquaintances
of
sherman
whom
he
had
invited
to
dinner
and
who
were
interested
in
nothing
but
statistics
about
the
south
and
other
like
stupid
things
tired
by
the
day
exhausting
demands
lloyd
left
them
when
they
went
into
the
and
stepping
out
on
the
porch
sat
down
on
the
steps
the
moon
was
coming
up
turning
the
locusts
to
silver
presently
she
heard
the
sound
of
down
the
pike
and
as
she
listened
a
solitary
horseman
turned
in
at
the
gate
she
was
not
expecting
rob
but
even
at
that
distance
she
recognized
the
familiar
slouch
of
his
hat
and
the
erect
way
he
sat
in
the
saddle
and
she
knew
before
a
word
was
spoken
the
moment
he
dismounted
and
stood
before
her
that
he
had
not
come
for
a
call
only
to
bring
some
message
but
he
did
not
deliver
it
at
once
only
asked
who
the
guests
were
and
sat
down
beside
her
on
the
steps
and
talked
about
the
trivial
happenings
of
the
afternoon
then
a
few
minutes
later
she
was
walking
along
beside
him
under
the
locusts
the
moonlight
lay
in
silver
patches
among
the
black
shadows
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
breath
of
roses
they
stopped
at
the
old
measuring
tree
and
rob
dropped
the
light
tone
in
which
he
had
been
jesting
and
his
face
grew
tense
in
his
deep
earnestness
it
no
use
trying
any
longer
lloyd
he
said
abruptly
i
ca
give
you
up
the
golden
wedding
was
too
much
for
me
he
took
a
step
nearer
dear
is
there
i
could
do
to
make
myself
worthier
in
your
sight
in
the
old
days
knights
could
go
out
and
their
valour
and
fealty
could
you
give
me
some
such
chance
set
me
a
task
i
go
to
the
world
end
to
do
it
lloyd
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
leaning
against
the
trunk
of
the
gnarled
locust
she
stood
idly
tracing
the
outline
of
the
clover
that
he
had
cut
beside
the
date
the
last
time
they
measured
there
then
she
said
in
a
low
tone
yes
you
can
bring
me
the
diamond
leaf
that
we
talked
about
so
often
by
that
token
you
prove
that
you
were
not
only
a
true
knight
but
that
all
these
yeahs
you
been
my
prince
in
disguise
he
smiled
ruefully
thinking
she
had
purposely
set
him
a
hopeless
task
they
had
read
the
legend
together
and
he
knew
full
well
that
abdallah
found
the
diamond
leaf
of
happiness
only
in
paradise
but
he
took
out
his
watch
and
opened
the
back
of
the
case
saying
hopefully
my
lucky
charm
has
never
failed
me
yet
how
long
will
you
give
me
to
find
it
she
held
out
her
hand
for
the
little
talisman
the
clover
she
had
given
him
so
many
years
ago
but
as
he
picked
it
up
the
dry
leaves
crumbled
to
dust
at
his
touch
and
only
one
fell
unbroken
into
her
outstretched
palm
my
good
omen
has
failed
me
when
i
needed
it
most
he
said
bitterly
but
lloyd
answered
shyly
no
do
you
see
this
is
the
leaf
you
have
brought
me
what
i
asked
for
for
an
instant
he
stood
there
an
incredulous
joy
dawning
in
his
face
then
grasping
the
little
hand
that
closed
over
the
clover
he
asked
wonderingly
and
my
unworthy
shoulders
really
fit
your
royal
mantle
dear
you
are
sure
she
looked
up
at
him
then
not
a
doubt
in
her
trusting
face
as
she
slowly
made
answer
yes
rob
the
falcon
feathahs
fit
the
falcon
and
then
the
old
locusts
looking
down
on
the
ending
of
a
story
that
they
had
watched
from
its
beginning
stopped
their
swaying
for
a
space
with
a
soft
sh
each
to
each
as
one
lays
finger
on
lip
in
holy
places
chapter
xv
as
it
was
written
in
the
stars
and
betty
diary
the
lights
are
out
and
gone
are
all
the
guests
it
is
very
late
but
i
must
sit
up
and
write
the
full
account
of
it
while
it
is
all
fresh
and
clear
in
my
mind
besides
i
am
too
wide
awake
to
sleep
even
if
i
should
try
it
was
a
beautiful
beautiful
wedding
but
i
must
go
back
ever
so
far
if
i
am
to
have
no
gaps
in
this
record
it
is
three
years
now
since
i
went
away
to
warwick
hall
to
teach
full
hard
years
but
so
rich
in
experiences
and
so
helpful
in
my
work
that
i
gladly
go
on
with
them
if
i
were
not
needed
here
at
home
but
they
do
need
me
now
that
lloyd
is
married
and
gone
and
although
she
has
not
gone
far
and
will
be
in
and
out
every
day
and
her
room
is
just
as
she
left
it
and
her
place
will
always
be
hers
still
i
am
the
daughter
of
the
house
in
many
ways
and
can
in
a
measure
make
up
to
godmother
and
papa
jack
all
they
have
done
for
me
i
think
they
do
feel
repaid
to
a
great
extent
by
my
little
successes
and
the
prospect
of
more
to
follow
by
and
by
it
made
me
so
glad
and
proud
when
i
heard
papa
jack
telling
the
doctor
about
the
essays
the
had
accepted
of
mine
and
how
pleased
he
was
over
the
series
of
sketches
that
the
new
york
publishers
are
going
to
bring
out
in
book
form
in
time
for
the
holidays
the
same
publishers
that
refused
my
poor
old
novel
too
it
does
not
seem
possible
that
two
years
and
a
half
have
gone
by
since
lloyd
wrote
to
me
of
her
engagement
but
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
look
forward
to
then
her
father
and
mother
would
not
have
consented
to
give
her
up
any
sooner
even
if
rob
had
been
in
a
position
to
ask
it
now
he
has
been
a
member
of
his
grandfather
firm
for
a
full
year
and
everybody
says
he
is
one
of
the
most
promising
young
lawyers
ever
admitted
to
the
louisville
bar
he
has
gone
into
his
life
work
as
he
went
into
all
his
games
to
win
and
he
is
so
big
and
strong
and
i
know
that
godmother
and
papa
jack
feel
perfectly
safe
in
giving
lloyd
up
to
him
i
think
that
even
the
old
colonel
finds
it
a
little
easier
to
be
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
her
leaving
because
he
is
so
fond
and
proud
of
rob
but
he
seems
to
take
it
to
heart
more
than
any
one
else
lloyd
thought
he
did
too
and
when
she
first
began
to
plan
her
wedding
she
asked
her
father
if
he
would
feel
hurt
if
she
asked
her
grandfather
instead
of
him
to
go
with
her
to
the
altar
and
give
her
away
you
know
papa
jack
she
said
in
that
saucy
way
of
hers
that
no
one
about
the
place
can
resist
you
cut
him
off
from
the
one
chance
he
should
have
had
to
perform
that
ceremony
by
running
away
with
mothah
so
it
only
fair
you
should
make
it
up
to
him
now
by
giving
him
the
honah
of
escorting
me
besides
you
and
she
have
each
othah
and
he
feels
so
left
out
and
lonely
and
is
making
such
a
deadly
serious
affair
of
my
going
away
papa
jack
saw
it
from
her
point
of
view
and
was
entirely
willing
to
do
as
she
wished
when
the
old
colonel
found
out
what
lloyd
wanted
he
was
so
touched
and
pleased
and
complimented
that
i
think
he
must
have
lain
awake
nights
trying
to
think
of
things
to
show
his
appreciation
this
last
week
she
called
presentation
week
because
every
single
day
he
surprised
her
with
some
lovely
present
the
first
day
he
gave
her
the
little
silver
with
butterfly
handles
and
the
shaped
like
a
lily
that
he
had
promised
her
the
first
time
she
had
a
pink
party
up
in
his
room
when
she
was
a
tiny
little
girl
the
next
day
it
was
a
purse
full
of
bright
new
gold
pieces
and
the
next
a
locket
that
had
been
his
mother
all
set
round
with
sapphires
and
with
sapphires
strung
at
intervals
on
the
slender
chain
that
held
it
one
day
the
gift
was
a
treasure
of
a
rosewood
chair
and
that
had
belonged
to
lloyd
grandmother
amanthis
with
all
the
little
articles
that
go
with
a
desk
just
as
she
had
used
them
she
was
too
surprised
for
anything
the
day
he
gave
her
the
harp
it
had
been
called
hers
since
she
started
to
learn
to
play
on
it
but
she
never
for
a
moment
supposed
he
would
allow
it
taken
away
from
the
locusts
the
sixth
present
had
no
intrinsic
value
but
he
had
treasured
it
for
years
a
medal
bestowed
on
one
of
his
virginia
ancestors
by
the
king
as
a
reward
for
his
services
to
the
crown
in
those
early
days
of
struggle
and
stress
in
the
colonies
then
last
and
best
of
all
in
lloyd
eyes
was
a
splendid
copy
of
the
beautiful
portrait
of
her
grandmother
amanthis
i
can
not
distinguish
it
from
the
original
that
has
always
hung
over
the
mantel
in
the
the
colonel
had
a
fine
artist
come
on
from
new
york
to
paint
it
while
lloyd
was
at
the
seashore
this
summer
she
was
so
happy
over
it
and
all
her
heirlooms
she
said
she
did
want
her
father
and
mother
to
give
her
any
new
silver
they
had
talked
about
a
full
set
she
said
there
was
so
much
old
family
plate
over
at
oaklea
which
she
would
far
rather
use
so
godmother
gave
her
a
chest
of
linen
and
papa
jack
some
shares
in
the
arizona
mines
she
has
actually
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
the
thought
that
she
is
marrying
a
poor
man
and
has
been
preparing
for
it
all
during
her
engagement
by
keeping
her
expenses
within
a
certain
limit
instead
of
spending
in
the
lavish
way
she
has
always
been
accustomed
to
she
taken
such
pride
too
in
learning
all
the
housewifely
arts
that
her
grandmother
and
the
judge
wife
were
so
noted
for
eugenia
and
stuart
tremont
came
several
days
ago
and
joyce
came
with
them
to
be
one
of
the
bridesmaids
phil
could
not
leave
his
work
just
now
long
enough
to
come
but
he
sent
the
dearest
little
gift
a
honey
dish
and
cover
with
a
honey
spoon
to
go
with
it
the
spoon
is
a
flat
gold
one
with
a
cluster
of
bees
on
the
handle
the
note
he
sent
with
it
was
dear
too
thanking
her
so
beautifully
for
the
inspiration
and
help
her
friendship
had
been
to
him
and
for
her
good
advice
that
sent
him
to
the
school
of
the
bees
lloyd
was
so
pleased
that
she
hunted
up
a
little
unset
turquoise
he
had
once
given
her
as
a
friendship
stone
and
rob
took
it
to
town
and
had
a
jeweller
set
it
into
a
tiny
for
her
and
she
wore
it
as
the
something
blue
at
her
wedding
rob
could
afford
to
give
her
an
expensive
present
like
the
diamond
pendant
that
raleigh
claiborne
gave
allison
when
they
were
married
last
summer
but
it
pleased
lloyd
more
than
a
queen
tiara
could
have
done
it
was
just
a
little
clasp
to
fasten
her
bridal
veil
he
had
it
made
to
order
only
a
clover
but
the
fourth
leaf
was
because
like
the
one
abdallah
found
in
paradise
it
was
the
leaf
of
happiness
it
was
just
a
quiet
church
wedding
as
simple
as
it
could
possibly
be
made
in
the
late
afternoon
of
one
of
the
sweetest
goldenest
october
days
that
ever
shone
on
the
valley
only
her
most
intimate
friends
were
invited
to
the
ceremony
because
the
little
stone
church
is
so
small
but
the
doors
were
thrown
open
to
everybody
at
the
reception
that
followed
at
the
locusts
since
the
church
has
been
frescoed
inside
and
done
over
in
soft
cool
greens
it
makes
me
think
of
the
heart
of
a
deep
beech
woods
the
light
slips
in
through
its
narrow
windows
just
as
it
does
between
the
trees
in
the
dim
forest
aisles
lloyd
would
have
it
filled
with
hothouse
roses
she
said
nothing
could
be
as
appropriate
as
the
wild
flowers
growing
all
around
it
in
the
country
lanes
and
meadows
so
there
was
nothing
but
tall
plumes
of
goldenrod
nodding
in
every
open
window
while
the
altar
was
a
bank
of
snowy
asters
she
wanted
them
she
said
because
aster
means
star
and
it
was
at
the
altar
her
happiness
would
be
written
for
her
in
the
stars
she
said
too
that
as
long
as
it
was
in
the
country
and
she
think
of
the
conventions
and
could
have
things
just
as
she
pleased
she
wanted
it
to
be
a
white
wedding
everybody
in
the
bridal
party
to
wear
white
she
said
the
old
colonel
would
look
natural
to
her
in
anything
else
that
time
of
year
and
all
the
others
would
appear
to
better
advantage
every
one
said
afterward
what
a
beautiful
picture
it
made
rob
and
malcolm
and
keith
and
ranald
and
alex
are
all
handsome
young
fellows
anyhow
and
they
looked
bigger
and
handsomer
than
ever
in
their
immaculate
white
suits
malcolm
was
best
man
and
i
was
maid
of
honour
kitty
and
joyce
and
katie
mallard
were
the
bridesmaids
we
girls
carried
armfuls
of
the
starry
asters
and
the
men
wore
them
as
boutonnières
illustration
looked
to
me
just
like
one
of
her
own
lilies
as
for
lloyd
when
she
came
out
of
her
room
her
dress
trailing
behind
her
like
a
soft
cloud
so
light
and
airy
it
seemed
as
if
it
must
have
been
woven
on
some
fairy
loom
and
with
a
great
cluster
of
in
her
hands
she
looked
to
me
just
like
one
of
her
own
lilies
poor
old
mom
beck
who
had
dressed
her
stood
behind
her
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
black
face
saying
honey
you
nevah
will
look
moah
like
a
blessed
angel
when
you
git
through
the
pearly
gates
than
you
do
this
minute
from
the
look
on
rob
face
as
he
met
her
at
the
white
altar
i
am
sure
he
felt
that
he
had
already
gone
through
the
pearly
gates
it
was
all
so
sweet
and
solemn
and
as
we
listened
to
the
words
god
hath
joined
i
think
we
all
felt
that
heaven
own
benediction
rested
on
them
and
would
follow
them
all
their
way
to
the
land
o
the
leal
how
the
people
of
the
valley
poured
in
at
the
locusts
afterward
to
wish
them
joy
old
and
young
rich
and
poor
white
and
black
for
of
course
all
the
old
servants
of
both
families
had
to
come
in
to
pay
their
respects
i
am
sure
that
no
more
heartfelt
good
wishes
were
uttered
than
their
god
bless
you
miss
lloyd
honey
or
i
wish
you
joy
mistah
rob
as
the
faithful
black
hands
that
had
served
them
from
babyhood
grasped
theirs
with
loyal
they
seem
to
count
this
year
that
joins
the
two
old
families
and
estates
as
a
sort
of
year
of
jubilee
it
is
often
that
a
wedding
has
everybody
approval
as
this
one
has
lloyd
has
always
been
as
much
of
a
favourite
at
oaklea
as
rob
is
at
the
locusts
the
judge
is
radiantly
happy
and
moore
has
been
as
sweet
and
considerate
about
everything
as
if
lloyd
were
really
her
own
daughter
she
wants
lloyd
to
take
the
place
as
mistress
of
the
house
just
as
she
did
when
went
there
a
bride
she
and
rob
father
did
take
a
wedding
journey
but
went
straight
home
to
oaklea
to
spend
their
honeymoon
and
she
was
so
pleased
when
she
found
that
lloyd
and
rob
wanted
to
do
the
same
she
and
the
judge
waited
just
long
enough
to
welcome
them
home
and
then
took
the
train
for
alabama
to
visit
some
of
her
people
they
have
long
been
wanting
to
make
the
trip
and
so
chose
this
time
all
the
details
of
the
supper
were
carried
out
just
as
they
were
at
eugenia
wedding
excepting
the
charms
lloyd
vowed
she
had
lost
faith
in
them
since
mammy
easter
fortune
had
failed
to
come
true
by
rights
joyce
should
have
been
married
before
either
allison
or
herself
because
she
caught
eugenia
bouquet
but
because
the
girls
still
believed
in
them
she
did
throw
her
bouquet
from
the
top
of
the
steps
just
before
she
left
and
kitty
caught
it
it
is
only
a
step
over
to
oaklea
so
she
went
away
in
her
bridal
gown
and
veil
i
never
forget
the
picture
she
made
as
she
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
waiting
for
the
carriage
to
drive
up
for
them
or
the
adoring
look
in
rob
eyes
as
he
turned
to
lead
her
down
the
steps
somehow
it
makes
the
tears
come
crowding
up
in
such
a
mist
i
can
hardly
see
to
write
and
now
i
have
come
to
the
last
page
of
this
volume
of
my
book
dear
lloyd
dear
little
sister
who
was
the
beginning
of
all
my
good
times
i
am
glad
that
heaven
has
sent
you
this
happy
day
for
me
to
chronicle
what
a
beautiful
road
of
the
loving
heart
your
girlhood
has
left
in
the
memory
of
all
your
friends
what
a
spirit
of
joy
you
have
been
in
this
old
home
and
what
an
aching
void
you
have
left
behind
you
no
matter
what
the
years
may
hold
in
store
you
will
a
blessing
wherever
you
go
for
you
have
learned
to
keep
tryst
with
all
that
life
demands
of
you
and
because
you
were
true
to
your
hildegarde
promise
and
wove
only
according
to
the
silver
yardstick
i
can
close
this
record
in
the
same
words
that
end
the
old
story
we
have
both
loved
so
long
with
her
father
blessing
light
upon
her
she
rode
away
beside
the
prince
and
ever
after
all
her
life
was
crowned
with
happiness

it
had
been
