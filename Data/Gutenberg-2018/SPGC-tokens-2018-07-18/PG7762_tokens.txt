wanderers
introduction
an
autobiographical
element
is
evident
in
practically
everything
that
hamsun
has
written
but
it
is
particularly
marked
in
the
two
volumes
now
published
under
the
common
title
of
wanderers
as
well
as
in
the
sequel
named
the
last
these
three
works
must
be
considered
together
they
have
more
in
common
than
the
central
figure
of
knut
pedersen
from
the
northlands
through
whose
vision
the
fates
of
captain
falkenberg
and
his
wife
are
gradually
unfolded
to
us
not
only
do
they
refer
undisguisedly
to
events
known
to
be
taken
out
of
hamsun
own
life
but
they
mirror
his
moods
and
thoughts
and
feelings
during
a
certain
period
so
closely
that
they
may
well
be
regarded
as
diaries
of
an
unusually
intimate
character
it
is
as
psychological
documents
of
the
utmost
importance
to
the
understanding
of
hamsun
himself
that
they
have
their
chief
significance
as
a
one
might
almost
say
the
reader
gets
the
art
which
reveals
the
story
of
the
falkenbergs
by
a
process
of
indirect
approach
equalled
in
its
ingenuity
and
verisimilitude
only
by
conrad
best
efforts
the
line
of
hamsun
artistic
evolution
is
easily
traceable
through
certain
stages
which
however
are
not
separated
by
sharp
breaks
it
is
impossible
to
say
that
one
stage
ended
and
the
next
one
began
in
a
certain
year
instead
they
overlap
like
tiles
on
a
roof
their
respective
characters
are
strikingly
symbolized
by
the
titles
of
the
dramatic
trilogy
which
hamsun
produced
between
and
at
the
gate
of
the
kingdom
the
game
of
life
and
sunset
hunger
opened
the
first
period
and
pan
marked
its
climax
but
it
came
to
an
end
only
with
the
drama
of
vendt
the
monk
in
and
traces
of
it
are
to
be
found
in
everything
that
hamsun
ever
wrote
lieutenant
glahn
might
survive
the
passions
and
defiances
of
his
youth
and
lapse
into
the
more
or
less
wistful
resignation
of
knut
pedersen
from
the
northlands
but
the
cautious
puzzled
knut
has
moments
when
he
shows
not
only
the
glahn
limp
but
the
glahn
fire
just
when
the
second
stage
found
clear
expression
is
a
little
hard
to
tell
but
its
most
characteristic
products
are
undoubtedly
the
two
volumes
now
offered
to
the
american
public
and
it
persists
more
or
less
until
when
the
last
joy
appeared
although
the
first
signs
of
hamsun
final
and
greatest
development
showed
themselves
as
early
as
when
dreamers
was
published
the
difference
between
the
second
and
the
third
stages
lies
chiefly
in
a
maturity
and
tolerance
of
vision
that
restores
the
narrator
sense
of
humour
and
eliminates
his
own
personality
from
the
story
he
has
to
tell
hamsun
was
when
he
finished
hunger
and
that
was
the
age
given
to
one
after
another
of
his
central
figures
glahn
is
of
course
and
so
is
the
monk
vendt
with
hamsun
that
age
seemed
to
stand
principally
for
the
high
water
mark
of
passion
because
of
the
fire
burning
within
themselves
his
heroes
had
the
supreme
courage
of
being
themselves
in
utter
defiance
of
codes
and
customs
because
of
that
fire
they
were
capable
of
rising
above
everything
that
life
might
bring
above
everything
but
the
passing
of
the
passion
itself
a
glahn
dies
but
does
not
grow
old
life
insists
on
its
due
course
however
and
in
reality
passion
may
sink
into
neurasthenia
without
producing
suicides
ivar
kareno
discovers
it
in
sunset
glow
when
at
the
age
of
fifty
he
turns
renegade
in
more
senses
than
one
but
even
then
his
realization
could
not
be
fully
accepted
by
the
author
himself
still
only
and
so
kareno
steps
down
into
the
respectable
and
honoured
sloth
of
age
only
to
be
succeeded
by
another
hero
who
has
not
yet
passed
the
climacteric
year
even
in
dreamers
retains
the
youthful
glow
and
charm
and
irresponsibility
that
used
to
be
thought
inseparable
from
the
true
hamsun
character
it
is
therefore
with
something
of
a
shock
one
encounters
the
enigmatic
knut
pedersen
from
the
northlands
who
has
turned
from
literature
to
tramping
who
speaks
of
old
age
as
if
he
had
reached
the
proverbial
and
ten
and
who
time
and
again
slips
into
something
like
actual
whining
as
when
he
says
of
himself
time
has
worn
me
out
so
that
i
have
grown
stupid
and
sterile
and
indifferent
now
i
look
upon
a
woman
merely
as
the
two
volumes
named
under
the
autumn
star
and
a
wanderer
plays
on
muted
strings
form
an
unbroken
cry
of
regret
and
the
object
of
that
regret
is
the
of
youth
that
golden
age
of
when
every
woman
regardless
of
age
and
colour
and
caste
was
a
challenging
fragment
of
life
something
more
than
the
passing
of
years
must
have
characterized
the
period
immediately
proceeding
the
production
of
the
two
volumes
just
mentioned
they
mark
some
sort
of
crisis
reaching
to
the
innermost
depths
of
the
soul
it
wracked
with
anguish
and
pain
perhaps
a
clue
to
this
crisis
may
be
found
in
the
all
too
brief
paragraph
devoted
to
hamsun
in
the
norwegian
who
there
is
a
line
that
reads
as
follows
married
bergljot
bassöe
bech
marriage
dissolved
marie
the
man
that
wrote
under
the
autumn
star
was
unhappy
but
he
was
also
an
artist
in
that
book
the
artist
within
him
is
struggling
for
his
existence
in
a
wanderer
plays
with
muted
strings
the
artist
is
beginning
to
assert
himself
more
and
more
and
that
he
had
conquered
in
the
meantime
we
know
by
benoni
and
rosa
which
appeared
in
the
crisis
was
past
but
echoes
of
it
were
heard
as
late
as
the
year
of
last
joy
which
well
may
be
called
hamsun
most
melancholy
book
yet
that
is
the
book
which
seems
to
have
paved
the
way
and
laid
the
foundation
for
the
growth
of
the
soil
just
as
dreamers
was
a
sketch
out
of
which
in
due
time
grew
children
of
the
time
and
segelfoss
hamsun
form
is
always
fluid
in
the
two
works
now
published
it
approaches
formlessness
under
the
autumn
star
is
a
mere
sketch
seemingly
lacking
both
plan
and
plot
much
of
the
time
knut
pedersen
is
merely
thinking
aloud
but
out
of
his
devious
musings
a
purpose
finally
shapes
itself
and
gradually
we
find
ourselves
the
spectator
of
a
marital
drama
that
becomes
the
dominant
note
in
the
sequel
the
development
of
this
main
theme
is
as
i
have
already
suggested
distinctly
conradian
in
its
method
and
looking
back
from
the
ironical
epilogue
that
closes
a
wanderer
plays
on
muted
strings
one
marvels
at
the
art
that
could
work
such
a
compelling
totality
out
of
such
a
miscellany
of
unrelated
fragments
there
is
a
weakness
common
to
both
these
works
which
can
not
be
passed
up
in
silence
more
than
once
the
narrator
falls
out
of
his
part
as
a
tramp
worker
to
rail
journalistically
at
various
things
that
have
aroused
his
particular
wrath
such
as
the
tourist
traffic
the
city
worker
and
everything
relating
to
switzerland
it
is
done
very
naively
too
but
it
is
well
to
remember
how
frequently
in
the
past
this
very
kind
of
naiveté
has
associated
with
great
genius
and
whatever
there
be
of
such
shortcomings
is
more
than
balanced
by
the
wonderful
feeling
for
and
understanding
of
nature
that
most
frequently
tempt
hamsun
into
straying
from
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
conventional
story
telling
what
can
not
be
forgiven
to
the
man
who
writes
of
faint
whisperings
that
come
from
forest
and
river
as
if
millions
of
nothingnesses
kept
streaming
and
streaming
and
who
finds
in
those
whisperings
one
eternity
coming
to
an
understanding
with
another
eternity
about
something
edwin
bjorkman
under
the
autumn
star
i
smooth
as
glass
the
water
was
yesterday
and
smooth
as
glass
it
is
again
today
indian
summer
on
the
island
mild
and
warm
ah
but
there
is
no
sun
it
is
many
years
now
since
i
knew
such
peace
twenty
or
thirty
years
maybe
or
maybe
it
was
in
another
life
but
i
have
felt
it
some
time
surely
since
i
go
about
now
humming
a
little
tune
go
about
rejoicing
loving
every
straw
and
every
stone
and
feeling
as
if
they
cared
for
me
in
return
when
i
go
by
the
overgrown
path
in
through
the
woods
my
heart
quivers
with
an
unearthly
joy
i
call
to
mind
a
spot
on
the
eastern
shores
of
the
caspian
where
i
once
stood
all
just
as
it
is
here
with
the
water
still
and
heavy
and
as
now
i
walked
through
the
woods
touched
to
the
heart
and
verging
on
tears
for
sheer
happiness
sake
and
saying
to
myself
all
the
time
god
in
heaven
to
be
here
again
as
if
i
had
been
there
before
ah
well
i
may
have
been
there
once
before
perhaps
coming
from
another
time
and
another
land
where
the
woods
and
the
woodland
paths
were
the
same
perhaps
i
was
a
flower
then
in
the
woods
or
perhaps
a
beetle
with
its
home
in
some
acacia
tree
and
now
i
have
come
to
this
place
perhaps
i
was
a
bird
and
flew
all
that
long
way
or
the
kernel
in
some
fruit
sent
by
a
persian
trader
see
now
i
am
well
away
from
the
rush
and
crowd
of
the
city
from
people
and
newspapers
i
have
fled
away
from
it
all
because
of
the
calling
that
came
to
me
once
more
from
the
quiet
lonely
tracts
where
i
belong
it
will
all
come
right
this
time
i
tell
myself
and
am
full
of
hope
alas
i
have
fled
from
the
city
like
this
before
and
afterwards
returned
and
fled
away
again
but
this
time
i
am
resolved
peace
i
will
have
at
any
cost
and
for
the
present
i
have
taken
a
room
in
a
cottage
here
with
old
gunhild
to
look
after
me
here
and
there
among
the
pines
are
rowans
with
ripe
coral
berries
now
the
berries
are
falling
heavy
clusters
striking
the
earth
so
they
reap
themselves
and
sow
themselves
again
an
inconceivable
abundance
to
be
squandered
every
single
year
over
three
hundred
clusters
i
can
count
on
a
single
tree
and
here
and
there
about
are
flowers
still
in
bloom
obstinate
things
that
will
not
die
though
their
time
is
really
past
but
old
gunhild
time
is
past
as
well
and
think
you
she
will
die
she
goes
about
as
if
death
were
a
thing
did
not
concern
her
when
the
fishermen
are
down
on
the
beach
painting
their
boats
or
darning
nets
comes
gunhild
with
her
vacant
eyes
but
with
a
mind
as
keen
as
any
to
a
bargain
and
what
is
the
price
of
mackerel
today
she
asks
the
same
as
then
you
can
keep
it
for
all
i
and
gunhild
goes
back
home
but
the
fishermen
know
that
gunhild
is
not
one
of
those
that
only
pretend
to
go
away
she
has
gone
off
like
that
before
now
up
to
her
cottage
without
once
looking
back
so
hey
they
call
to
her
and
say
they
make
it
seven
to
the
today
seeing
she
is
an
old
customer
and
gunhild
buys
her
fish
washing
hangs
on
the
lines
to
dry
red
petticoats
and
blue
shirts
and
of
preposterous
thickness
all
spun
and
woven
on
the
island
by
the
old
women
still
left
alive
but
there
is
washing
too
of
another
sort
those
fine
chemises
without
sleeves
the
very
thing
to
make
a
body
blue
with
cold
and
mauve
woollen
undervests
that
pull
out
to
no
more
than
the
thickness
of
a
string
and
how
did
these
abominations
get
there
why
is
the
daughters
to
be
sure
the
young
girls
of
the
present
day
who
been
in
service
in
the
towns
and
earned
such
finery
that
way
wash
them
carefully
and
not
too
often
and
the
things
will
last
for
just
a
month
and
then
there
is
a
lovely
naked
feeling
when
the
holes
begin
to
spread
but
there
is
none
of
that
sort
of
nonsense
now
about
gunhild
shoes
for
instance
at
suitable
intervals
she
goes
round
to
one
of
the
fishermen
her
like
in
age
and
mind
and
gets
the
uppers
and
the
soles
done
in
thoroughly
with
a
powerful
mess
of
stuff
that
leaves
the
water
simply
helpless
i
seen
that
dubbin
boiling
on
the
beach
tallow
in
it
and
tar
and
resin
as
well
wandering
idly
along
the
beach
yesterday
looking
at
driftwood
and
scales
and
stones
i
came
upon
a
tiny
bit
of
plate
glass
how
it
ever
got
there
is
more
than
i
can
make
out
but
the
thing
seems
a
mistake
a
very
lie
to
look
at
would
any
fisherman
now
have
rowed
out
here
with
it
and
laid
it
down
and
rowed
away
again
i
left
it
where
it
lay
it
was
thick
and
common
and
vulgar
perhaps
a
bit
of
a
tramcar
window
once
on
a
time
glass
was
rare
and
god
blessing
on
the
old
days
when
something
could
be
rare
smoke
rising
now
from
the
on
the
southern
point
of
the
island
evening
time
and
porridge
cooking
for
supper
and
when
done
decent
folk
go
to
their
beds
to
be
up
again
with
the
dawn
only
young
and
foolish
creatures
still
go
trapesing
round
from
house
to
house
putting
off
their
bedtime
not
knowing
what
is
best
for
themselves
ii
a
man
landed
here
this
morning
come
to
paint
the
house
but
old
gunhild
being
very
old
indeed
and
perishing
with
gout
most
times
gets
him
to
cut
up
a
few
days
firewood
for
her
cooking
before
he
starts
i
offered
many
a
time
to
cut
that
wood
myself
but
she
thinks
my
clothes
too
fine
and
would
not
let
me
have
the
ax
on
any
account
this
painter
now
is
a
short
fellow
with
red
hair
and
no
beard
i
watch
him
from
behind
a
window
as
he
works
to
see
how
he
handles
the
ax
then
noticing
that
he
is
talking
to
himself
i
steal
out
of
the
house
to
listen
if
he
makes
a
false
stroke
he
takes
it
patiently
and
does
not
trouble
himself
but
whenever
he
knocks
his
knuckles
he
turns
irritable
and
says
footnote
the
devil
power
of
the
devil
and
then
looks
round
suddenly
and
starts
humming
a
tune
to
cover
his
words
yes
i
recognize
that
painter
man
only
he
not
a
painter
at
all
the
rascal
but
grindhusen
one
of
the
men
i
worked
with
when
i
was
roadmaking
at
skreia
i
go
up
to
him
and
ask
if
he
remembers
me
and
we
talk
a
bit
many
many
years
it
is
now
since
we
were
roadmenders
together
grindhusen
and
i
we
were
youngsters
then
and
danced
along
the
roads
in
the
sorriest
of
shoes
and
ate
what
we
could
get
as
long
as
we
had
money
enough
for
that
but
when
we
money
to
spare
then
there
would
be
dancing
with
the
girls
all
saturday
night
and
a
crowd
of
our
would
come
along
and
the
old
woman
in
the
house
sold
us
coffee
till
she
must
have
made
a
little
fortune
then
we
worked
on
heart
and
soul
another
week
through
looking
forward
to
the
saturday
again
but
grindhusen
he
was
as
a
wolf
after
the
girls
did
he
remember
the
old
days
at
skreia
he
looks
at
me
taking
stock
of
me
with
something
of
reserve
it
is
quite
a
while
before
i
can
draw
him
out
to
remember
it
at
all
yes
he
remembers
skreia
well
enough
and
anders
fila
and
and
petra
which
one
petra
the
one
that
was
your
ay
i
remember
her
i
got
tied
up
with
her
at
grindhusen
falls
to
chopping
wood
again
got
tied
up
with
her
did
you
ay
that
was
the
end
of
it
had
to
be
i
suppose
what
was
i
going
to
say
now
you
turned
out
something
fine
by
the
look
of
why
is
it
these
clothes
you
thinking
of
you
sunday
clothes
yourself
now
have
you
what
give
for
those
you
got
on
i
ca
remember
but
it
was
nothing
very
much
could
say
exactly
what
it
grindhusen
looks
at
me
in
astonishment
and
bursts
out
laughing
what
ca
remember
what
you
paid
for
them
then
he
turns
serious
shakes
his
head
and
says
no
i
dare
say
you
would
no
that
the
way
when
you
money
enough
and
old
gunhild
comes
out
from
the
house
and
seeing
us
standing
there
by
the
wasting
time
in
idle
talk
she
tells
grindhusen
better
start
on
the
painting
so
you
turned
painter
now
said
grindhusen
made
no
answer
and
i
saw
i
had
said
a
thing
that
should
not
have
been
said
in
others
hearing
iii
grindhusen
works
away
a
couple
of
hours
with
his
putty
and
paint
and
soon
one
side
of
the
little
house
the
north
side
facing
the
sea
is
done
all
gaily
in
red
at
the
rest
i
go
out
and
join
him
with
something
to
drink
and
we
lie
on
the
ground
awhile
chatting
and
smoking
painter
not
much
of
a
one
and
that
the
truth
says
he
but
if
any
one
comes
along
and
asks
if
i
can
paint
a
bit
of
a
wall
why
of
course
i
can
this
you
his
wife
and
two
children
lived
some
four
miles
off
and
he
went
home
to
them
every
saturday
there
were
two
daughters
besides
both
grown
up
and
one
of
them
married
grindhusen
was
a
grandfather
already
as
soon
as
he
done
painting
gunhild
cottage
two
coats
it
was
to
have
he
was
going
off
to
the
vicarage
to
dig
a
well
there
was
always
work
of
some
sort
to
be
had
about
the
villages
and
when
winter
set
in
and
the
frost
began
to
bind
he
would
either
take
a
turn
of
woodcutting
in
the
forests
or
lie
idle
for
a
spell
till
something
else
turned
up
he
no
big
family
to
look
after
now
and
the
morrow
no
doubt
would
look
after
itself
just
as
today
if
i
could
only
manage
it
said
grindhusen
i
know
what
i
do
get
myself
some
bricklayer
so
you
a
bricklayer
too
well
not
much
of
a
one
and
that
the
truth
but
when
that
dug
why
it
need
to
be
lined
that
clear
i
sauntered
about
the
island
as
usual
thinking
of
this
and
that
peace
peace
a
heavenly
peace
comes
to
me
in
a
voice
of
silence
from
every
tree
in
the
wood
and
now
look
you
there
are
but
few
of
the
small
birds
left
only
some
crows
flying
mutely
from
place
to
place
and
settling
and
the
clusters
from
the
rowans
drop
with
a
sullen
thud
and
bury
themselves
in
the
moss
grindhusen
is
right
perhaps
tomorrow
will
surely
look
after
itself
just
as
today
i
have
not
seen
a
paper
now
these
last
two
weeks
and
for
all
that
here
i
am
alive
and
well
making
great
progress
in
respect
of
inward
calm
i
sing
and
square
my
shoulders
and
stand
bareheaded
watching
the
stars
at
night
for
eighteen
years
past
i
have
sat
in
cafés
calling
for
the
waiter
if
a
fork
was
not
clean
i
never
call
for
gunhild
in
the
matter
of
forks
clean
or
not
there
grindhusen
now
i
say
to
myself
did
you
mark
when
he
lit
his
pipe
how
he
used
the
match
to
the
very
last
of
it
and
never
burned
his
horny
fingers
i
saw
a
fly
crawling
over
his
hand
but
he
simply
let
it
crawl
perhaps
he
never
noticed
it
was
there
that
is
the
way
a
man
should
feel
towards
flies
in
the
evening
grindhusen
takes
the
boat
and
rows
off
i
wander
along
the
beach
singing
to
myself
a
little
throwing
stones
at
the
water
and
hauling
bits
of
driftwood
ashore
the
stars
are
out
and
there
is
a
moon
in
a
couple
of
hours
grindhusen
comes
back
with
a
good
set
of
bricklayer
tools
in
the
boat
stolen
them
somewhere
i
think
to
myself
we
shoulder
each
our
load
and
hide
away
the
tools
among
the
trees
then
it
is
night
and
we
go
each
our
separate
way
grindhusen
finishes
his
painting
the
following
afternoon
but
agrees
to
go
on
cutting
wood
till
six
to
make
up
a
full
day
work
i
get
out
gunhild
boat
and
go
off
fishing
so
as
not
to
be
there
when
he
leaves
i
catch
no
fish
and
it
is
cold
sitting
in
the
boat
i
look
at
my
watch
again
and
again
at
last
about
seven
he
must
be
gone
by
now
i
say
to
myself
and
i
row
home
grindhusen
has
got
over
to
the
mainland
and
calls
across
to
me
from
there
farvel
something
thrilled
me
warmly
at
the
word
it
was
like
a
calling
from
my
youth
from
skreia
from
days
a
generation
gone
i
row
across
to
him
and
ask
can
you
dig
that
well
all
alone
no
i
have
to
take
another
man
take
me
i
said
wait
for
me
here
while
i
go
up
and
settle
at
the
up
i
heard
grindhusen
calling
again
i
ca
wait
here
all
night
and
i
do
believe
you
meant
it
wait
just
a
minute
i
be
down
again
and
grindhusen
sets
himself
down
on
the
beach
to
wait
he
knows
some
of
that
still
left
iv
we
came
to
the
vicarage
on
a
saturday
after
much
doubting
grindhusen
had
at
last
agreed
to
take
me
as
his
mate
i
had
bought
provisions
and
some
working
clothes
and
stood
there
now
in
blouse
and
high
boots
ready
to
start
work
i
was
free
and
unknown
i
learned
to
walk
with
a
long
slouching
stride
and
for
the
look
of
a
laboring
man
i
had
that
already
both
in
face
and
hands
we
were
to
put
up
at
the
vicarage
itself
and
cook
our
food
in
the
across
the
yard
and
so
we
started
on
our
digging
i
did
my
share
of
the
work
and
grindhusen
had
no
fault
to
find
with
me
as
a
you
turn
out
a
hand
at
this
after
all
he
said
then
after
we
been
working
a
bit
the
priest
came
out
to
look
and
we
took
off
our
hats
he
was
an
oldish
man
quiet
and
gentle
in
his
ways
and
speech
tiny
wrinkles
spread
out
fanwise
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
like
the
traces
of
a
thousand
kindly
smiles
he
was
sorry
to
interrupt
and
hoped
we
would
mind
but
they
so
much
trouble
every
year
with
the
fowls
slipping
through
into
the
garden
could
we
leave
the
well
just
for
a
little
and
come
round
and
look
at
the
garden
wall
there
was
one
place
in
particular
grindhusen
answered
surely
we
manage
that
for
him
all
right
so
we
went
up
and
set
the
crumbling
wall
to
rights
while
we
were
busy
there
a
young
lady
came
out
and
stood
looking
on
we
greeted
her
politely
and
i
thought
her
a
beautiful
creature
to
see
then
a
lad
came
out
to
look
and
asked
all
sorts
of
questions
the
two
were
brother
and
sister
no
doubt
and
the
work
went
on
easily
enough
with
the
young
folk
there
looking
on
then
evening
came
grindhusen
went
off
home
leaving
me
behind
i
slept
in
the
hayloft
for
the
night
next
day
was
sunday
i
dared
not
put
on
my
town
clothes
lest
they
should
seem
above
my
station
but
cleaned
up
my
working
things
as
neatly
as
i
could
and
idled
about
the
place
in
the
quiet
of
sunday
morning
i
chatted
to
the
and
joined
them
in
talking
nonsense
to
the
maids
when
the
bell
began
ringing
for
church
i
sent
in
to
ask
if
i
might
borrow
a
prayer
book
and
the
priest
son
brought
me
one
himself
one
of
the
men
lent
me
a
coat
it
was
big
enough
really
but
taking
off
my
blouse
and
vest
i
made
it
do
and
so
i
went
to
church
that
inward
calm
i
had
been
at
such
pains
to
build
up
on
the
island
proved
all
too
little
yet
at
the
first
thrill
of
the
organ
i
was
torn
from
my
setting
and
came
near
to
sobbing
aloud
keep
quiet
you
fool
i
said
to
myself
it
only
i
had
chosen
a
seat
well
apart
from
the
rest
and
hid
my
emotion
as
best
i
could
i
was
glad
when
that
service
was
over
when
i
had
boiled
my
meat
and
had
some
dinner
i
was
invited
into
the
kitchen
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
while
i
sat
there
in
came
frøkenen
the
young
lady
i
had
seen
the
day
before
i
stood
up
and
bowed
a
greeting
and
she
nodded
in
return
she
was
charming
with
her
youth
and
her
pretty
hands
when
i
got
up
to
go
i
forgot
myself
and
said
most
kind
of
you
i
sure
my
dear
young
lady
she
glanced
at
me
in
astonishment
frowned
and
the
colour
spread
in
her
cheeks
till
they
burned
then
with
a
toss
of
her
head
she
turned
and
left
the
room
she
was
very
young
well
i
had
done
a
nice
thing
now
miserable
at
heart
i
sneaked
up
into
the
woods
to
hide
impertinent
fool
why
had
i
held
my
tongue
of
all
the
ridiculous
things
to
say
the
vicarage
buildings
lay
on
the
slope
of
a
small
hill
from
the
top
the
land
stretched
away
flat
and
level
with
alternating
timber
and
clearing
it
struck
me
that
here
would
be
the
proper
place
to
dig
the
well
and
then
run
a
down
the
slope
to
the
house
judging
the
height
as
nearly
as
i
can
it
seems
more
than
enough
to
give
the
pressure
needed
on
the
way
back
i
pace
out
the
approximate
length
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
but
what
business
was
it
of
mine
after
all
for
heaven
sake
let
me
not
go
making
the
same
mistake
again
and
insulting
folk
by
talking
above
my
station
v
grindhusen
came
out
again
on
monday
morning
and
we
fell
to
digging
as
before
the
old
priest
came
out
to
look
and
asked
if
we
could
fix
a
post
for
him
on
the
road
up
to
the
church
he
needed
it
badly
that
post
it
had
stood
there
before
but
had
got
blown
down
he
used
it
for
nailing
up
notices
and
announcements
we
set
up
a
new
post
and
took
pains
to
get
it
straight
and
upstanding
as
a
candle
in
a
stick
and
by
the
way
of
thanks
we
hooded
the
top
with
zinc
while
i
was
at
work
on
the
hood
i
got
grindhusen
to
suggest
that
the
post
should
be
painted
red
he
had
still
a
trifle
of
red
paint
left
over
from
the
work
at
gunhild
cottage
but
the
priest
wanted
it
white
and
grindhusen
was
afraid
to
contradict
and
carefully
agreed
to
all
he
said
until
at
last
i
put
in
a
word
and
said
that
notices
on
white
paper
would
show
up
better
against
red
at
that
the
priest
smiled
with
the
endless
wrinkles
round
his
eyes
and
said
yes
yes
of
course
you
quite
and
that
was
enough
just
that
bit
of
a
smile
and
saying
i
was
right
made
me
all
glad
and
proud
again
within
then
frøkenen
came
up
and
said
a
few
words
to
grindhusen
even
jested
with
him
asking
what
that
red
cardinal
was
to
be
stuck
up
there
for
on
the
road
but
to
me
she
said
nothing
at
all
and
did
not
even
look
at
me
when
i
took
off
my
hat
dinner
was
a
sore
trial
to
me
that
day
not
that
the
food
was
bad
no
but
grindhusen
he
ate
his
soup
in
a
disgusting
fashion
and
his
mouth
was
all
greasy
with
fat
what
he
be
like
when
it
comes
to
eating
porridge
i
thought
to
myself
hysterically
then
when
he
leaned
back
on
the
bench
to
rest
after
his
meal
in
the
same
greasy
state
i
called
to
him
straight
out
for
heaven
sake
man
are
you
going
to
wipe
your
mouth
he
stared
at
me
wiping
his
mouth
with
one
hand
mouth
he
said
i
tried
to
turn
it
off
then
as
a
joke
and
said
haha
i
had
you
there
but
i
was
displeased
with
myself
for
all
that
and
went
out
of
the
brewhouse
directly
after
then
i
fell
to
thinking
of
frøkenen
i
make
her
answer
when
i
give
a
greeting
i
said
to
myself
i
let
her
see
before
very
long
that
i
not
altogether
a
there
was
that
business
of
the
well
and
the
now
what
if
i
were
to
work
out
a
plan
for
the
whole
installation
all
complete
i
had
no
instruments
to
take
the
height
and
fall
of
the
hill
well
i
could
make
one
that
would
serve
and
i
set
to
work
a
wooden
tube
with
two
ordinary
fixed
in
with
putty
and
the
whole
filled
with
water
soon
it
was
found
there
were
many
little
things
needed
seeing
to
about
the
vicarage
odd
matters
here
and
there
a
stone
step
to
be
set
straight
again
a
wall
to
be
repaired
the
bridgeway
to
the
barn
had
to
be
strengthened
before
the
corn
could
be
brought
in
the
priest
liked
to
have
everything
sound
and
in
order
about
the
place
and
it
was
all
one
to
us
seeing
we
were
paid
by
the
day
but
as
time
went
on
i
grew
more
and
more
impatient
of
my
company
it
was
torture
to
me
for
instance
to
see
him
pick
up
a
loaf
from
the
table
hold
it
close
in
to
his
chest
and
cut
off
a
slice
with
a
greasy
that
he
was
always
putting
in
his
mouth
and
then
again
he
would
go
all
through
the
week
from
sunday
to
sunday
without
a
and
in
the
morning
before
the
sun
was
up
and
the
evening
after
it
had
gone
there
was
always
a
shiny
drop
hanging
from
the
tip
of
his
nose
and
then
his
nails
and
as
for
his
ears
they
were
simply
deformed
alas
i
was
an
upstart
creature
that
had
learned
fine
manners
in
the
cafés
in
town
and
since
i
could
not
keep
myself
from
telling
my
companion
now
and
then
what
i
thought
of
his
uncleanly
ways
there
grew
up
a
certain
between
us
and
i
feared
we
should
have
to
separate
before
long
as
it
was
we
hardly
spoke
now
beyond
what
was
needed
and
there
was
the
well
as
undug
as
ever
sunday
came
and
grindhusen
had
gone
home
i
had
got
my
apparatus
finished
now
and
in
the
afternoon
i
climbed
up
to
the
roof
of
the
main
building
and
set
it
up
there
i
saw
at
once
that
the
sight
cut
the
hillside
several
metres
below
the
top
good
even
reckoning
a
whole
metre
down
to
the
there
would
still
be
pressure
enough
and
to
spare
while
i
was
busy
up
there
the
priest
son
caught
sight
of
me
harald
meltzer
was
his
name
and
what
was
i
doing
up
there
measuring
the
hill
what
for
what
did
i
want
to
know
the
height
for
would
i
let
him
try
later
on
i
got
hold
of
a
line
ten
metres
long
and
measured
the
hill
from
foot
to
summit
with
harald
to
help
when
we
came
down
to
the
house
i
asked
to
see
the
priest
himself
and
told
him
of
my
plan
vi
the
priest
listened
patiently
and
did
not
reject
the
idea
at
once
really
now
he
said
with
a
smile
why
perhaps
you
right
but
it
will
cost
a
lot
of
money
and
why
should
we
trouble
about
it
at
all
it
seventy
paces
from
the
house
to
the
well
we
started
to
dig
seventy
steps
for
the
maids
to
go
through
mud
and
snow
and
all
sorts
summer
and
that
true
yes
but
this
other
way
would
cost
a
terrible
lot
of
not
counting
the
well
that
you
have
to
have
in
any
case
the
whole
installation
with
work
and
material
ought
not
to
come
to
more
than
a
couple
of
hundred
kroner
said
i
the
priest
looked
surprised
is
that
all
i
waited
a
little
each
time
before
answering
as
if
i
were
slow
by
nature
and
born
so
but
really
i
had
thought
out
the
whole
thing
beforehand
it
would
be
a
great
convenience
that
true
said
the
priest
thoughtfully
and
that
water
tub
in
the
kitchen
does
make
a
lot
of
and
it
will
save
carrying
water
to
the
bedrooms
as
the
bedrooms
are
all
upstairs
it
wo
help
us
there
i
we
can
run
the
pipes
up
to
the
first
can
we
though
up
to
the
bedrooms
will
there
be
pressure
enough
for
that
do
you
think
here
i
waited
longer
than
usual
before
answering
as
a
stolid
fellow
who
did
not
undertake
things
lightly
i
think
i
can
answer
for
a
jet
the
height
of
the
roof
i
said
really
now
exclaimed
the
priest
and
then
again
come
and
let
us
see
where
you
think
of
digging
the
we
went
up
the
hill
the
priest
harald
and
i
and
i
let
the
priest
look
through
my
instrument
and
showed
him
that
there
would
be
more
than
pressure
enough
i
must
talk
to
the
other
man
about
it
he
said
but
i
cut
out
grindhusen
at
once
and
said
grindhusen
he
no
idea
of
this
work
at
the
priest
looked
at
me
really
he
said
then
we
went
down
again
the
priest
talking
as
if
to
himself
quite
right
yes
it
an
endless
business
fetching
water
in
the
winter
and
summer
too
for
that
matter
i
must
see
what
the
women
think
about
and
he
went
indoors
after
ten
minutes
or
so
i
was
sent
for
round
to
the
front
steps
the
whole
family
were
there
now
so
you
the
man
who
going
to
give
us
water
laid
on
to
the
house
said
fruen
kindly
i
took
off
my
cap
and
bowed
in
a
heavy
stolid
fashion
and
the
priest
answered
for
me
yes
this
was
the
man
frøkenen
gave
me
one
curious
glance
and
then
started
talking
in
an
undertone
to
her
brother
fruen
went
on
with
more
questions
would
it
really
be
a
proper
like
they
had
in
town
just
turn
on
a
tap
and
there
was
the
water
all
ready
and
for
upstairs
as
well
a
couple
of
hundred
kroner
really
i
think
you
ought
to
say
yes
she
said
to
her
husband
you
think
so
well
let
all
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
look
through
the
thing
and
we
went
up
the
hill
and
i
set
the
instrument
for
them
and
let
them
look
wonderful
said
fruen
but
frøkenen
said
never
a
word
the
priest
asked
but
are
you
sure
there
water
here
i
answered
carefully
as
a
man
of
sober
judgment
that
it
was
not
a
thing
to
swear
to
beforehand
but
there
was
every
sign
of
it
what
sort
of
signs
asked
fruen
the
nature
of
the
ground
and
you
notice
there
willow
and
osiers
growing
about
and
they
like
a
wet
the
priest
nodded
and
said
he
knows
his
business
marie
you
can
on
the
way
back
fruen
had
got
so
far
as
to
argue
quite
unwarrantably
that
she
could
manage
with
one
maid
less
once
they
water
laid
on
and
not
to
fail
her
i
put
in
in
summer
at
least
you
might
you
could
water
all
the
garden
with
a
hose
fixed
to
the
tap
and
carried
out
through
the
cellar
splendid
she
exclaimed
but
i
did
not
venture
to
speak
of
laying
a
pipe
to
the
i
had
realized
all
the
time
that
with
a
well
twice
the
size
and
a
branch
pipe
across
the
yard
the
dairymaid
would
be
saved
as
much
as
the
in
the
house
but
it
would
cost
nearly
twice
as
much
no
it
was
not
wise
to
put
forward
so
great
a
scheme
even
as
it
was
i
had
to
agree
to
wait
till
grindhusen
came
back
the
priest
said
he
wanted
to
sleep
on
it
vii
so
now
i
had
to
tell
grindhusen
myself
and
prepare
him
for
the
new
arrangement
and
lest
he
should
turn
suspicious
i
threw
all
the
blame
on
the
priest
saying
it
was
his
idea
but
that
i
had
backed
him
up
grindhusen
had
no
objection
he
saw
at
once
it
meant
more
work
for
us
since
we
should
have
the
well
to
dig
in
any
case
and
the
bed
for
the
pipes
besides
as
luck
would
have
it
the
priest
came
out
on
monday
morning
and
said
to
grindhusen
half
jestingly
your
mate
here
and
i
have
decided
to
have
the
well
up
on
the
hill
and
lay
down
a
to
the
house
what
do
you
think
of
it
a
mad
idea
grindhusen
thought
it
was
a
idea
but
when
we
came
to
talk
it
over
and
went
up
all
three
to
look
at
the
site
of
the
well
grindhusen
began
to
suspect
i
had
more
to
do
with
it
than
i
had
said
we
should
have
to
lay
the
pipes
deep
down
he
said
on
account
of
the
frost
one
metre
thirty
plenty
i
said
and
that
it
would
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
your
mate
here
said
about
a
couple
of
hundred
kroner
in
all
answered
the
priest
grindhusen
had
no
idea
of
estimates
at
all
and
could
only
say
well
well
two
hundred
kroner
a
deal
of
money
i
said
it
will
mean
so
much
less
in
when
you
the
priest
looked
at
me
in
surprise
but
i
not
thinking
of
leaving
the
place
he
said
why
then
you
have
the
full
use
of
it
and
may
your
reverence
live
to
enjoy
it
for
many
a
year
said
i
at
this
the
priest
stared
at
me
and
asked
what
is
your
name
knut
where
are
you
from
from
but
i
understood
why
he
had
asked
and
resolved
not
to
talk
in
that
bookish
way
any
more
anyhow
the
well
and
the
were
decided
on
and
we
set
to
work
the
days
that
followed
were
pleasant
enough
i
was
not
a
little
anxious
at
first
as
to
whether
we
should
find
water
on
the
site
and
i
slept
badly
for
some
nights
but
once
that
fear
was
past
all
that
remained
was
simple
and
straightforward
work
there
was
water
enough
after
a
couple
of
days
we
had
to
bale
it
out
with
buckets
every
morning
it
was
clay
lower
down
and
our
clothes
were
soon
in
a
sorry
state
from
the
work
we
dug
for
a
week
and
started
the
next
getting
out
stones
to
line
the
well
this
was
work
we
were
both
used
to
from
the
old
days
at
skreia
then
we
put
in
another
week
digging
and
by
that
time
we
had
carried
it
deep
enough
the
bottom
was
soon
so
soft
that
we
had
to
begin
on
the
stonework
at
once
lest
the
clay
walls
should
cave
in
on
top
of
us
so
week
after
week
passed
with
digging
and
mining
and
mason
work
it
was
a
big
well
and
made
a
nice
job
the
priest
was
pleased
with
it
grindhusen
and
i
began
to
get
on
better
together
and
when
he
found
that
i
asked
no
more
than
a
fair
labourer
wage
though
much
of
the
work
was
done
under
my
directions
he
was
inclined
to
do
something
for
me
in
return
and
took
more
care
about
his
table
manners
altogether
i
could
not
have
wished
for
a
happier
time
and
nothing
on
earth
should
ever
persuade
me
to
go
back
to
town
life
again
in
the
evenings
i
wandered
about
the
woods
or
in
the
churchyard
reading
the
inscriptions
on
the
tombstones
and
thinking
of
this
and
that
also
i
was
looking
about
for
a
nail
from
some
corpse
i
wanted
a
nail
it
was
a
fancy
of
mine
a
little
whim
i
had
found
a
nice
piece
of
that
i
wanted
to
carve
to
a
in
the
shape
of
a
clenched
fist
the
thumb
was
to
act
as
a
lid
and
i
wanted
a
nail
to
set
in
to
make
it
specially
lifelike
the
ring
finger
was
to
have
a
little
gold
ring
bent
round
thinking
of
such
trifles
kept
my
mind
calm
and
at
ease
there
was
no
hurry
now
for
me
about
anything
in
life
i
could
dream
as
i
pleased
having
nothing
else
to
do
the
evenings
were
my
own
if
possible
too
i
would
see
and
arrive
at
some
feeling
of
respect
for
the
sacredness
of
the
church
and
terror
of
the
dead
i
had
still
a
memory
of
that
rich
mysticism
from
days
now
far
far
behind
and
wished
i
could
have
some
share
in
it
again
now
perhaps
when
i
found
that
nail
there
would
come
a
voice
from
the
tombs
that
is
mine
and
i
would
drop
the
thing
in
horror
and
take
to
my
heels
and
run
i
wish
that
vane
up
there
would
creak
so
grindhusen
would
say
at
times
are
you
afraid
well
not
properly
afraid
no
but
it
gives
you
a
creeping
feeling
now
and
then
to
think
of
all
the
corpses
lying
there
so
happy
man
one
day
harald
showed
me
how
to
plant
pine
cones
and
little
bushes
no
idea
of
that
sort
of
work
before
we
did
learn
it
in
the
days
when
i
was
at
school
but
now
i
seen
the
way
of
it
i
went
about
planting
busily
on
sundays
and
in
return
i
taught
harald
one
or
two
little
things
that
were
new
to
him
at
his
age
and
got
to
be
friends
with
him
viii
and
all
might
have
been
well
if
it
had
not
been
for
frøkenen
the
daughter
of
the
house
i
grew
fonder
of
her
every
day
her
name
was
elischeba
elisabeth
no
remarkable
beauty
perhaps
but
she
had
red
lips
and
a
blue
girlish
glance
that
made
her
pretty
to
see
elischeba
elisabeth
a
child
at
the
first
dawn
of
life
with
eyes
looking
out
upon
the
world
she
spoke
one
evening
with
young
erik
from
the
neighbouring
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
sweetness
and
of
something
ripening
it
was
all
very
well
for
grindhusen
he
had
gone
ravening
after
the
girls
when
he
was
young
and
he
still
spanked
about
with
his
hat
on
one
side
out
of
habit
but
he
was
quiet
and
tame
enough
now
as
well
he
might
be
is
nature
way
but
some
there
are
who
would
not
follow
nature
way
and
be
tamed
and
how
shall
it
fare
with
them
at
last
and
then
there
was
little
elisabeth
and
she
was
none
so
little
after
all
but
as
tall
as
her
mother
and
she
her
mother
high
breast
since
that
first
sunday
they
had
not
asked
me
in
to
coffee
in
the
kitchen
and
i
took
care
myself
they
should
not
but
kept
out
of
the
way
i
was
still
ashamed
of
the
recollection
but
then
at
last
in
the
middle
of
the
week
one
of
the
maids
came
with
a
message
that
i
was
not
to
go
running
off
into
the
woods
every
sunday
afternoon
but
come
to
coffee
with
the
rest
fruen
herself
had
said
so
good
now
should
i
put
on
my
best
clothes
or
not
no
harm
perhaps
in
letting
that
young
lady
get
into
her
head
that
i
was
one
who
had
chosen
to
turn
my
back
upon
the
life
of
cities
and
taken
upon
myself
the
guise
of
a
servant
for
all
i
was
a
man
of
parts
that
could
lay
on
water
to
a
house
but
when
i
had
dressed
i
felt
myself
that
my
working
clothes
were
better
suited
to
me
now
i
took
off
my
best
things
again
and
hid
them
carefully
in
my
bag
but
as
it
happened
it
was
not
frøkenen
at
all
who
received
me
on
that
sunday
afternoon
but
fruen
she
talked
to
me
for
quite
a
while
and
she
had
spread
a
little
white
cloth
under
my
cup
that
trick
of
yours
with
the
egg
is
likely
to
cost
us
something
before
we
done
with
it
said
fruen
with
a
kindly
laugh
the
boy
used
up
half
a
dozen
eggs
i
had
taught
harald
the
trick
of
passing
a
hard
boiled
egg
with
the
shell
off
through
the
neck
of
a
decanter
by
thinning
the
air
inside
it
was
about
the
only
experiment
in
physics
that
i
knew
but
that
one
with
breaking
the
stick
in
the
two
paper
loops
was
really
interesting
fruen
went
on
i
do
understand
that
sort
of
thing
myself
but
when
will
the
well
be
done
the
well
is
done
we
going
to
start
on
the
trench
and
how
long
will
that
take
to
do
about
a
week
then
the
man
can
come
and
lay
the
no
really
i
said
my
thanks
and
went
out
fruen
had
a
way
she
had
kept
no
doubt
from
earlier
years
now
and
again
she
would
glance
at
one
sideways
though
there
was
nothing
the
least
bit
artful
in
what
she
said
now
the
woods
showed
a
yellowing
leaf
here
and
there
and
earth
and
air
began
to
smell
of
autumn
only
the
fungus
growths
were
now
at
their
best
shooting
up
everywhere
and
flourishing
fine
and
thick
on
woolly
stems
milk
mushrooms
and
the
common
sort
and
the
brown
here
and
there
a
toadstool
thrust
up
its
speckled
top
flaming
its
red
all
unashamed
a
wonderful
thing
here
it
is
growing
on
the
same
spot
as
the
edible
sorts
fed
by
the
same
soil
given
sun
and
rain
from
heaven
the
same
as
they
rich
and
strong
it
is
and
good
to
eat
save
only
that
it
is
full
of
impertinent
muscarin
i
once
thought
of
making
up
a
fine
old
story
about
the
toadstool
and
saying
i
had
read
it
in
a
book
it
has
always
been
a
pleasure
to
me
to
watch
the
flowers
and
insects
in
their
struggle
to
keep
alive
when
the
sun
was
hot
they
would
come
to
life
again
and
give
themselves
up
for
an
hour
or
so
to
the
old
delight
the
big
strong
flies
were
just
as
much
alive
as
in
midsummer
there
was
a
peculiar
sort
of
here
that
i
had
not
seen
before
little
yellow
things
no
bigger
than
a
comma
yet
they
could
jump
several
thousand
times
their
own
length
think
of
the
strength
of
such
a
body
in
proportion
to
its
size
there
is
a
tiny
spider
here
with
its
hinder
part
like
a
pale
yellow
pearl
and
the
pearl
is
so
heavy
that
the
creature
has
to
clamber
up
a
stalk
of
grass
back
downwards
when
it
comes
upon
an
obstacle
the
pearl
can
not
pass
it
simply
drops
straight
down
and
starts
to
climb
another
now
a
little
like
that
is
not
just
a
spider
and
no
more
if
i
hold
out
a
leaf
towards
it
to
help
it
to
its
footing
on
a
floor
it
fumbles
about
for
a
while
on
the
leaf
and
thinks
to
itself
h
something
wrong
about
this
and
backs
away
again
refusing
to
be
in
any
way
entrapped
on
to
a
floor
some
one
calls
me
by
name
from
down
in
the
wood
it
is
harald
he
has
started
a
sunday
school
with
me
he
gave
me
a
lesson
out
of
pontoppidan
to
learn
and
now
i
to
be
heard
it
is
touching
to
be
taught
religion
now
as
i
should
have
taught
it
myself
when
i
was
a
child
ix
the
well
was
finished
the
trench
was
dug
and
the
man
had
come
to
lay
the
pipes
he
chose
grindhusen
to
help
him
with
the
work
and
i
was
set
to
cutting
a
way
for
the
pipes
up
from
the
cellar
through
the
two
floors
of
the
house
fruen
came
down
one
day
when
i
was
busy
in
the
cellar
i
called
out
to
her
to
mind
the
hole
in
the
floor
but
she
took
it
very
calmly
there
no
hole
there
now
is
there
she
asked
pointing
one
way
or
there
but
at
last
she
missed
her
footing
after
all
and
slipped
down
into
the
hole
where
i
was
and
there
we
stood
it
was
not
light
there
anyway
and
for
her
coming
straight
in
from
the
daylight
outside
it
must
have
seemed
quite
dark
she
felt
about
the
edge
and
said
now
how
am
i
to
get
up
again
i
lifted
her
up
it
was
no
matter
to
speak
of
she
was
slight
of
figure
for
all
she
had
a
big
girl
of
her
own
well
i
must
say
she
stood
shaking
the
earth
from
her
dress
one
two
three
and
up
as
neatly
as
could
be
look
here
i
like
you
to
help
me
with
something
upstairs
one
day
will
you
i
want
to
move
some
things
only
we
must
wait
till
a
day
when
my
husband
over
at
the
annexe
he
does
like
my
changing
things
about
how
long
will
it
be
before
you
finished
all
there
is
to
do
here
i
mentioned
a
time
a
week
or
thereabout
and
where
are
you
going
then
to
the
farm
just
by
grindhusen
fixed
it
up
for
us
to
go
and
dig
potatoes
there
then
came
the
work
in
the
kitchen
i
had
to
saw
through
the
floor
there
frøken
elisabeth
came
in
once
or
twice
while
i
was
there
it
could
hardly
have
been
otherwise
seeing
it
was
the
kitchen
and
for
all
her
dislike
of
me
she
managed
to
say
a
word
or
two
and
stand
looking
at
the
work
a
little
only
fancy
oline
she
said
to
the
maid
when
it
all
done
and
you
only
have
to
turn
on
a
but
oline
who
was
old
did
not
look
anyways
delighted
it
was
like
going
against
providence
she
said
to
go
sending
water
through
a
pipe
right
into
the
house
she
carried
all
the
water
she
a
use
for
these
twenty
years
what
was
she
to
do
now
take
a
rest
said
i
rest
indeed
we
made
to
work
i
take
it
not
to
and
sew
things
against
the
time
you
get
married
said
frøken
elisabeth
with
a
smile
it
was
only
girlish
talk
but
i
was
grateful
to
her
for
taking
a
little
part
in
the
talk
with
us
and
staying
there
for
a
while
and
heavens
how
i
did
try
to
behave
and
talk
smartly
and
sensibly
showing
off
like
a
boy
i
remember
it
still
then
suddenly
frøken
elisabeth
seemed
to
remember
it
was
proper
for
her
to
stay
out
here
with
us
any
longer
and
so
she
went
that
evening
i
went
up
to
the
churchyard
as
i
had
done
so
many
times
before
but
seeing
frøkenen
already
there
i
turned
away
and
took
myself
off
into
the
woods
and
afterwards
i
thought
now
she
will
surely
be
touched
by
my
humility
and
think
poor
fellow
he
showed
real
delicacy
in
that
and
the
next
thing
of
course
was
to
imagine
her
coming
after
me
i
would
get
up
from
the
stone
where
i
was
sitting
and
give
a
greeting
then
she
would
be
a
little
embarrassed
and
say
i
was
just
going
for
a
walk
it
such
a
lovely
evening
what
are
you
doing
here
just
sitting
here
say
i
with
innocent
eyes
as
if
my
thoughts
had
been
far
away
and
when
she
hears
that
i
was
just
sitting
there
in
the
late
of
the
evening
she
must
realize
that
i
am
a
dreamer
and
a
soul
of
unknown
depth
and
then
she
falls
in
love
with
me
she
was
in
the
churchyard
again
the
following
evening
and
a
thought
of
high
conceit
flew
suddenly
into
my
mind
it
was
myself
she
came
to
see
but
watching
her
more
closely
i
saw
that
she
was
busy
doing
something
about
a
grave
so
it
was
not
me
she
had
come
for
i
stole
away
up
to
the
big
in
the
wood
and
watched
the
insects
as
long
as
i
could
see
afterwards
i
sat
listening
to
the
falling
cones
and
clusters
of
rowan
berries
i
hummed
a
tune
and
whispered
to
myself
and
thought
now
and
again
i
had
to
get
up
and
walk
a
little
to
get
warm
the
hours
passed
the
night
came
on
and
i
was
so
in
love
i
walked
there
letting
myself
be
stared
out
of
all
countenance
by
the
stars
how
the
time
grindhusen
might
ask
when
i
came
back
to
the
barn
just
gone
eleven
i
would
say
though
it
might
be
two
or
three
in
the
morning
huh
and
a
nice
time
to
be
coming
to
bed
waking
folk
up
when
they
been
sleeping
decently
and
grindhusen
turns
over
on
the
other
side
to
fall
asleep
again
in
a
moment
there
was
no
trouble
with
grindhusen
eyah
it
of
a
man
to
fall
in
love
when
he
getting
on
in
years
and
who
was
it
set
out
to
show
there
a
way
to
quiet
and
peace
of
mind
x
a
man
came
out
for
his
bricklayer
tools
he
wanted
them
back
what
then
grindhusen
had
not
stolen
them
at
all
but
it
was
always
the
same
with
grindhusen
commonplace
dull
and
ordinary
never
great
in
anything
never
a
lofty
mind
i
said
you
grindhusen
there
nothing
in
you
but
eat
and
sleep
and
work
here
a
man
come
for
those
tools
now
so
you
only
borrowed
them
all
you
good
for
i
would
be
you
for
do
be
a
fool
said
grindhusen
he
was
offended
now
but
i
got
him
round
again
as
i
had
done
so
many
times
before
by
pretending
i
had
only
spoken
in
jest
what
are
we
to
do
now
he
asked
you
manage
it
all
right
said
i
manage
it
will
i
yes
or
i
am
much
and
grindhusen
was
pacified
once
more
but
at
the
midday
rest
when
i
was
cutting
his
hair
i
put
him
out
of
temper
once
again
by
suggesting
he
should
wash
his
head
a
man
of
your
age
ought
to
know
better
than
to
talk
such
stuff
he
said
and
heaven
knows
but
he
may
have
been
right
his
red
thatch
of
hair
was
thick
as
ever
for
all
he
grandchildren
of
his
own
now
what
was
coming
to
that
barn
of
ours
were
spirits
about
who
had
been
in
there
one
day
suddenly
and
cleaned
the
place
and
made
all
comfortable
and
neat
grindhusen
and
i
had
each
our
own
bedplace
i
had
bought
a
couple
of
rugs
but
he
turned
in
every
night
fully
dressed
with
all
he
stood
up
in
and
curled
himself
up
in
the
hay
all
anyhow
and
now
here
were
my
two
rugs
laid
neatly
looking
for
all
the
world
like
a
bed
i
nothing
against
it
was
one
of
the
maids
no
doubt
setting
to
teach
me
neat
and
orderly
ways
was
all
one
to
me
i
was
ready
now
to
start
cutting
through
the
floor
upstairs
but
fruen
begged
me
to
leave
it
to
next
day
her
husband
would
be
going
over
to
the
annexe
and
that
way
i
should
disturb
him
but
next
morning
we
had
to
put
it
off
again
frøken
elisabeth
was
going
in
to
the
store
to
buy
no
end
of
things
and
i
was
to
go
with
her
and
carry
them
good
said
i
i
come
on
strange
girl
had
she
thought
to
put
up
with
my
company
on
the
way
she
said
but
do
you
think
you
can
find
the
way
alone
surely
i
been
there
before
it
where
we
buy
our
now
i
could
well
walk
through
all
the
village
in
my
working
things
all
messed
up
with
clay
i
put
on
my
best
trousers
but
kept
my
blouse
on
over
so
i
walked
on
behind
it
was
a
couple
of
miles
or
more
the
last
part
of
the
way
i
caught
sight
of
frøken
elisabeth
on
ahead
now
and
again
but
i
took
care
not
to
come
up
close
once
she
looked
round
and
at
that
i
made
myself
utterly
small
and
kept
to
the
fringe
of
the
wood
frøken
elisabeth
stayed
behind
with
some
girl
friend
after
she
had
done
her
shopping
i
carried
the
things
back
to
the
vicarage
getting
in
about
noon
and
was
asked
in
to
dinner
in
the
kitchen
the
house
seemed
deserted
harald
was
away
the
maids
were
wringing
clothes
only
oline
was
busy
in
the
kitchen
after
dinner
i
went
upstairs
and
started
sawing
in
the
passage
come
and
lend
me
a
hand
here
will
you
said
fruen
walking
on
in
front
of
me
we
passed
by
her
husband
study
and
into
the
bedroom
i
want
my
bed
moved
said
fruen
it
too
near
the
stove
in
winter
and
i
ca
stand
the
we
moved
the
bed
over
to
the
window
it
be
nicer
here
do
you
think
cooler
said
she
and
happening
to
glance
at
her
i
saw
she
was
watching
me
with
that
queer
sideways
look
ey
and
in
a
moment
i
was
all
flesh
and
blood
and
foolishness
i
heard
her
say
are
you
mad
oh
no
dear
please
the
door
then
i
heard
my
name
whispered
again
and
again
i
sawed
through
the
floor
in
the
passage
and
got
everything
done
fruen
was
there
all
the
time
she
was
so
eager
to
talk
to
explain
and
laughing
and
crying
all
the
time
i
said
that
picture
that
was
hanging
over
your
bed
would
it
be
as
well
to
move
that
too
ye
es
perhaps
it
would
said
fruen
xi
now
all
the
pipes
were
laid
and
the
taps
fixed
the
water
spurted
out
in
the
sink
in
a
fine
powerful
jet
grindhusen
had
borrowed
the
tools
we
needed
from
somewhere
else
so
we
could
plaster
up
a
few
holes
left
here
and
there
a
couple
of
days
more
and
we
had
filled
in
the
trench
down
the
hillside
and
our
work
at
the
vicarage
was
done
the
priest
was
pleased
with
us
he
offered
to
stick
up
a
notice
on
the
red
post
saying
we
were
experts
in
the
business
of
wells
and
pipes
and
but
seeing
it
was
so
late
in
the
year
and
the
frost
might
set
in
any
time
it
would
have
helped
us
much
we
begged
him
instead
to
bear
us
in
mind
next
spring
then
we
went
over
to
the
neighbouring
farm
to
dig
potatoes
promising
to
look
in
at
the
vicarage
again
some
time
there
were
many
hands
at
work
on
the
new
place
we
divided
up
into
gangs
and
were
merry
enough
but
the
work
would
barely
last
over
a
week
after
that
we
should
have
to
shift
again
one
evening
the
priest
came
over
and
offered
to
take
me
on
as
an
outdoor
hand
at
the
vicarage
it
was
a
nice
offer
and
i
thought
about
it
for
a
while
but
ended
by
saying
no
i
would
rather
wander
about
and
be
my
own
master
doing
such
work
as
i
could
find
here
and
there
sleeping
in
the
open
and
finding
a
trifle
to
wonder
at
in
myself
i
had
come
across
a
man
here
in
the
potato
fields
that
i
might
join
company
with
when
grindhusen
was
gone
this
new
man
was
a
fellow
after
my
own
mind
and
from
what
i
had
heard
and
seen
of
him
a
good
worker
lars
falkberget
was
his
name
wherefore
he
called
himself
falkenberg
footnote
the
latter
name
has
a
more
distinguished
sound
than
the
native
and
rustic
young
erik
was
foreman
and
overseer
in
charge
of
the
potato
diggers
and
carted
in
the
crop
he
was
a
handsome
lad
of
twenty
steady
and
sound
for
his
age
and
a
proper
son
of
the
house
there
was
something
no
doubt
between
him
and
frøken
elisabeth
from
the
vicarage
seeing
she
came
over
one
day
and
stood
talking
with
him
out
in
the
fields
for
quite
a
while
when
she
was
leaving
she
found
a
few
words
for
me
as
well
saying
oline
was
beginning
to
get
used
to
the
new
contrivances
of
and
tap
and
yourself
i
asked
out
of
politeness
she
made
some
little
answer
to
this
also
but
i
could
see
she
had
no
wish
to
stay
talking
to
me
so
prettily
dressed
she
was
with
a
new
light
cloak
that
went
so
well
with
her
blue
eyes
next
day
erik
met
with
an
accident
his
horse
bolted
dragging
him
across
the
fields
and
throwing
him
up
against
a
fence
at
last
he
was
badly
mauled
and
spitting
blood
a
few
hours
later
when
he
had
come
to
himself
a
little
he
was
still
spitting
blood
falkenberg
was
now
set
to
drive
i
feigned
to
be
distressed
at
what
had
happened
and
went
about
silent
and
gloomy
as
the
rest
but
i
did
not
feel
so
i
had
no
hope
of
frøken
elisabeth
for
myself
indeed
still
i
was
rid
of
one
that
stood
above
me
in
her
favour
that
evening
i
went
over
to
the
churchyard
and
sat
there
a
while
if
only
she
would
come
i
thought
to
myself
and
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
came
i
got
up
suddenly
entirely
as
i
had
planned
made
as
if
to
slip
away
and
hide
then
i
stopped
stood
helplessly
and
surrendered
but
here
all
my
schemes
and
plans
forsook
me
and
i
was
all
weakness
at
having
her
so
near
i
began
to
speak
of
something
erik
to
think
it
should
have
happened
and
that
yesterday
i
know
about
it
she
answered
he
was
badly
yes
yes
of
course
he
was
badly
hurt
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
him
i
thought
no
i
do
know
but
anyhow
he
get
better
and
then
it
will
be
all
right
again
yes
yes
pause
it
sounded
as
if
she
had
been
making
fun
of
me
then
suddenly
she
said
with
a
smile
what
a
strange
fellow
you
are
what
makes
you
walk
all
that
way
to
come
and
sit
here
of
an
evening
it
just
a
little
habit
i
got
lately
for
something
to
do
till
then
you
not
afraid
her
jesting
tone
gave
me
courage
i
felt
myself
on
surer
ground
and
answered
no
that
just
the
trouble
i
wanted
to
learn
to
shiver
and
learn
to
shiver
and
shake
like
the
boy
in
the
fairy
tale
now
where
did
you
read
about
that
i
wonder
i
do
know
in
some
book
or
other
i
pause
why
would
you
come
and
work
for
us
when
father
asked
you
i
be
no
good
at
that
sort
of
work
i
going
out
on
the
roads
now
with
another
which
way
are
you
going
that
i
can
not
say
east
or
west
we
are
just
pause
i
sorry
she
said
i
mean
i
do
think
it
wise
of
you
oh
but
what
was
it
you
said
about
erik
i
only
came
to
ask
about
him
he
in
a
baddish
way
now
but
does
the
doctor
think
he
will
get
better
yes
as
far
as
i
know
i
not
heard
well
oh
to
be
young
and
rich
and
handsome
and
famous
and
learned
in
sciences
there
she
goes
before
leaving
the
churchyard
i
found
a
serviceable
thumbnail
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
i
waited
a
little
peering
this
way
and
that
and
listening
but
all
was
still
no
voice
came
saying
that
mine
xii
falkenberg
and
i
set
out
it
is
evening
cool
air
and
a
lofty
sky
with
stars
lighting
up
i
persuaded
him
to
go
round
by
way
of
the
churchyard
in
my
foolishness
i
wished
to
go
that
way
to
see
if
there
should
be
light
in
one
little
window
down
at
the
vicarage
oh
to
be
young
and
rich
and
we
walked
some
hours
having
but
little
weight
to
carry
and
moreover
we
were
two
wanderers
still
a
bit
strange
each
to
the
other
so
we
could
talk
a
little
we
passed
by
the
first
trading
station
and
came
to
another
we
could
see
the
tower
of
the
annexe
church
in
the
evening
light
from
sheer
habit
i
would
have
gone
into
the
churchyard
here
as
well
i
said
what
do
you
think
we
might
find
a
place
here
for
the
night
no
sense
on
earth
in
that
said
falkenberg
when
there
hay
in
every
barn
along
the
road
and
if
we
turned
out
there
be
shelter
in
the
and
we
went
on
again
falkenberg
leading
he
was
a
man
of
something
over
thirty
tall
and
but
with
a
slight
stoop
his
long
moustaches
rounded
downwards
he
was
short
of
speech
for
the
most
and
kindly
also
he
had
a
splendid
voice
for
songs
a
different
sort
from
grindhusen
in
every
way
and
when
he
spoke
he
used
odd
words
from
different
local
dialects
with
a
touch
of
swedish
here
and
there
no
one
could
tell
what
part
he
came
from
we
came
to
a
farmstead
where
the
dogs
barked
and
folk
were
still
about
falkenberg
asked
to
see
the
man
a
lad
came
out
had
he
any
work
for
us
no
but
the
fence
there
along
by
the
road
was
all
to
pieces
if
we
mend
that
now
no
man
himself
had
nothing
else
to
do
this
time
of
the
year
could
they
give
us
shelter
for
the
night
very
sorry
but
not
in
the
barn
no
the
girls
were
still
sleeping
there
swine
muttered
falkenberg
as
we
moved
away
we
turned
in
through
a
little
wood
keeping
a
look
out
now
for
a
likely
place
to
sleep
suppose
we
went
back
to
the
farm
now
to
the
girls
in
the
barn
like
as
not
they
would
turn
us
falkenberg
thought
for
a
moment
the
dogs
will
make
a
row
he
said
we
came
out
into
a
field
where
two
horses
were
loose
one
had
a
bell
at
its
neck
nice
fellow
this
said
falkenberg
with
his
horses
still
out
and
his
womenfolk
still
sleeping
in
the
barn
it
be
doing
these
poor
beasts
a
good
turn
to
ride
them
a
he
caught
the
belled
horse
stuffed
its
bell
with
grass
and
moss
and
got
on
its
back
my
beast
was
shy
and
i
had
a
deal
of
trouble
to
get
hold
of
it
we
rode
across
the
field
found
a
gate
and
came
out
on
to
the
road
we
each
had
one
of
my
rugs
to
sit
on
but
neither
had
a
bridle
still
we
managed
well
enough
managed
excellently
well
we
rode
close
on
five
miles
and
came
to
another
village
suddenly
we
heard
some
one
ahead
along
the
road
better
take
it
at
a
gallop
said
falkenberg
over
his
shoulder
come
but
falkenberg
was
no
marvel
of
a
horseman
for
all
his
leg
he
clutched
the
first
then
slithered
forward
and
hung
on
with
both
arms
round
the
horse
neck
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
one
of
his
legs
against
the
sky
as
he
fell
off
fortunately
there
was
no
great
danger
waiting
us
after
all
only
a
young
couple
out
sweethearting
another
riding
and
we
were
both
of
us
stiff
and
sore
we
got
down
turned
the
horses
faces
to
home
and
drove
them
off
and
now
we
were
once
more
the
sound
came
from
somewhere
far
off
i
knew
it
well
it
was
the
grey
goose
when
we
were
children
we
were
taught
to
clasp
our
hands
and
stand
quite
still
lest
we
should
frighten
the
grey
goose
as
it
passed
no
harm
in
that
no
harm
in
doing
so
now
and
so
i
do
a
quiet
sense
of
mystery
steals
through
me
i
hold
my
breath
and
gaze
there
it
comes
the
sky
trailing
behind
it
like
the
wake
of
a
ship
high
overhead
and
the
splendid
ploughshare
glides
along
beneath
the
stars
we
found
a
barn
at
last
at
a
farmstead
where
all
was
still
and
there
we
slept
some
hours
they
found
us
next
morning
sound
asleep
falkenberg
went
up
to
the
farmer
at
once
and
offered
to
pay
for
our
lodging
we
had
come
in
late
the
night
before
he
explained
and
like
to
wake
folk
out
of
their
beds
but
we
were
no
runaways
for
all
that
the
man
would
not
take
our
money
instead
he
gave
us
coffee
in
the
kitchen
but
he
had
no
work
for
us
the
harvest
was
in
and
he
and
his
lad
had
nothing
to
do
themselves
now
but
mend
their
fences
here
and
there
xiii
we
tramped
three
days
and
found
no
work
but
had
to
pay
for
our
food
and
drink
getting
poorer
every
day
how
much
have
you
got
left
and
how
much
have
i
got
left
we
never
get
any
great
way
at
this
rate
said
falkenberg
and
he
threw
out
a
hint
that
we
soon
have
to
try
a
little
stealing
we
talked
it
over
a
bit
and
agreed
to
wait
and
see
how
things
turned
out
food
was
no
difficulty
we
could
always
get
hold
of
a
fowl
or
so
at
a
pinch
but
ready
money
was
the
thing
we
really
needed
and
that
have
to
get
if
we
could
manage
it
one
way
we
have
to
manage
another
we
did
set
up
to
be
angels
i
no
angel
out
of
heaven
alive
said
falkenberg
here
am
i
now
sitting
around
in
my
best
clothes
and
they
no
better
than
another
workaday
things
i
can
give
them
a
wash
in
a
stream
and
sit
and
wait
till
they
dry
if
there
a
hole
i
mend
it
and
if
i
chance
to
earn
a
bit
extra
some
day
i
can
get
some
more
and
that
the
end
of
but
young
erik
said
you
were
a
beggar
to
that
young
cock
drink
well
of
course
i
do
no
sense
in
only
eating
let
look
about
for
a
place
where
there
a
piano
said
falkenberg
i
thought
to
myself
a
piano
on
a
place
means
folk
where
he
is
going
to
start
stealing
in
the
afternoon
we
came
to
just
such
a
place
falkenberg
had
put
on
my
town
clothes
beforehand
and
given
me
his
sack
to
carry
so
he
could
walk
in
easily
with
an
air
he
went
straight
up
to
the
front
steps
and
i
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
bit
then
he
came
out
again
and
said
yes
he
was
going
to
tune
their
piano
going
to
you
be
quiet
said
falkenberg
i
done
it
before
though
i
do
go
bragging
about
it
he
fished
out
a
key
from
his
sack
and
i
saw
he
was
in
earnest
i
was
ordered
to
keep
near
the
place
while
he
was
tuning
well
i
wandered
about
to
pass
the
time
every
now
and
then
coming
round
to
the
south
side
of
the
house
i
could
hear
falkenberg
at
work
on
the
piano
in
the
parlour
and
forcibly
he
dealt
with
it
he
could
not
strike
a
decent
chord
but
he
had
a
good
ear
whenever
he
screwed
up
a
string
he
was
careful
to
screw
it
back
again
exactly
where
it
was
before
so
the
instrument
at
any
rate
was
none
the
worse
i
got
into
talk
with
one
of
the
a
young
fellow
he
got
two
hundred
kroner
a
year
he
said
besides
his
board
up
at
six
in
the
morning
to
feed
the
horses
or
five
in
the
busy
season
work
all
day
till
eight
in
the
evening
but
he
was
healthily
content
with
his
life
in
that
little
world
i
remember
his
fine
strong
set
of
teeth
and
his
pleasant
smile
as
he
spoke
of
his
girl
he
had
given
her
a
silver
ring
with
a
gold
heart
on
the
front
and
what
did
she
say
to
that
well
she
was
all
of
a
wonder
you
may
be
and
what
did
you
say
what
i
said
why
i
do
know
said
i
hoped
she
like
it
and
welcome
i
like
to
have
given
her
stuff
for
a
dress
as
well
but
is
she
young
why
yes
talk
away
like
a
little
jews
harp
young
i
should
think
and
where
does
she
live
ah
that
i
wo
say
they
know
it
all
over
the
village
if
i
and
there
i
stood
like
another
alexander
so
sure
of
the
world
and
half
contemptuous
of
this
boy
and
his
poor
little
life
when
we
went
away
i
gave
him
one
of
my
rugs
it
was
too
much
of
a
weight
to
go
carrying
two
he
said
at
once
he
would
give
it
to
his
girl
she
would
be
glad
of
a
nice
warm
rug
and
alexander
said
if
i
were
not
myself
i
would
be
you
when
falkenberg
had
finished
and
came
out
he
was
grown
so
elegant
in
his
manners
all
at
once
and
talked
in
such
a
delicate
fashion
i
could
hardly
understand
him
the
daughter
of
the
house
came
out
with
him
we
were
to
pass
on
without
delay
he
said
to
the
farm
adjacent
there
was
a
piano
there
which
needed
some
slight
attention
and
so
farvel
frøken
six
kroner
my
boy
he
whispered
in
my
ear
and
another
six
at
the
next
place
that
so
off
we
went
and
i
carried
our
things
xiv
falkenberg
was
right
the
people
at
the
next
farm
would
not
be
outdone
by
their
neighbours
their
piano
must
be
seen
to
as
well
the
daughter
of
the
house
was
away
for
the
moment
but
the
work
could
be
done
in
her
absence
as
a
little
surprise
for
her
when
she
came
home
she
had
often
complained
that
the
piano
was
so
dreadfully
out
of
tune
it
was
impossible
to
play
on
it
at
all
so
now
i
was
left
to
myself
again
as
before
while
falkenberg
was
busy
in
the
parlour
when
it
got
dark
he
had
lights
brought
in
and
went
on
tuning
he
had
his
supper
in
there
too
and
when
he
had
finished
he
came
out
and
asked
me
for
his
pipe
which
pipe
you
fool
the
one
with
the
clenched
fist
of
somewhat
unwillingly
i
handed
him
my
neatly
carved
pipe
i
had
just
got
it
finished
with
the
nail
set
in
and
a
gold
ring
and
a
long
stem
do
let
the
nail
get
too
hot
i
whispered
or
it
might
curl
falkenberg
lit
the
pipe
and
went
swaggering
up
with
it
indoors
but
he
put
in
a
word
for
me
too
and
got
them
to
give
me
supper
and
coffee
in
the
kitchen
i
found
a
place
to
sleep
in
the
barn
i
woke
up
in
the
night
and
there
was
falkenberg
standing
close
by
and
calling
me
by
name
the
full
moon
shone
right
in
and
i
could
see
his
face
what
the
matter
now
here
your
pipe
here
you
are
man
take
pipe
yes
your
pipe
i
wo
have
the
thing
about
me
another
minute
look
at
it
the
nail
all
coming
i
took
the
pipe
and
saw
the
nail
had
begun
to
curl
away
from
the
wood
said
falkenberg
the
beastly
thing
was
looking
at
me
with
a
sort
of
nasty
grin
in
the
moonlight
and
then
when
i
remembered
where
you
got
that
nail
happy
falkenberg
next
morning
when
we
were
ready
to
start
off
again
the
daughter
of
the
house
had
come
home
we
heard
her
thumping
out
a
waltz
on
the
piano
and
a
little
after
she
came
out
and
said
it
made
no
end
of
difference
with
the
piano
thank
you
very
i
hope
you
may
find
it
satisfactory
said
the
grandly
yes
indeed
there
quite
a
different
tone
in
it
and
is
there
anywhere
else
frøkenen
could
recommend
ask
the
people
at
øvrebø
falkenberg
the
name
falkenberg
go
straight
on
from
here
and
you
come
to
a
post
on
the
side
about
a
mile
and
a
half
along
turn
off
there
and
that
take
you
to
at
that
falkenberg
sat
down
plump
at
the
steps
and
began
asking
all
sorts
of
questions
about
the
falkenbergs
at
øvrebø
only
to
think
he
should
come
across
his
kinsmen
here
and
find
himself
as
it
were
at
home
again
he
was
profusely
grateful
for
the
information
thanks
most
sincerely
then
we
went
on
our
way
again
and
i
carried
the
things
once
in
the
wood
we
sat
down
to
talk
over
what
was
to
be
done
was
it
advisable
after
all
for
a
falkenberg
of
the
rank
of
to
go
walking
up
to
the
captain
at
øvrebø
and
claim
relationship
i
was
the
more
timid
and
ended
by
making
falkenberg
himself
a
little
shy
of
it
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
a
merry
jest
had
he
any
papers
with
his
name
on
certificates
of
some
sort
yes
but
for
there
nothing
in
them
except
saying
i
a
reliable
we
cast
about
for
some
way
of
altering
the
papers
a
little
but
finally
agreed
it
could
be
better
to
make
a
new
one
altogether
we
might
do
one
for
unsurpassed
proficiency
in
and
put
in
the
christian
name
as
leopold
instead
of
lars
footnote
again
substituting
an
aristocratic
for
a
rustic
name
there
was
no
limit
to
what
we
could
do
in
that
way
think
that
you
can
write
out
that
certificate
he
asked
yes
that
i
but
now
that
wretched
brain
of
mine
began
playing
tricks
and
making
the
whole
thing
ridiculous
a
was
enough
i
thought
no
make
him
a
mechanical
genius
a
man
who
had
solved
most
intricate
problems
an
inventor
with
a
factory
of
his
own
then
i
would
need
to
go
about
waving
certificates
said
falkenberg
and
refused
to
listen
any
more
no
the
whole
thing
looked
like
coming
to
nothing
after
all
downcast
and
discouraged
both
we
tramped
on
till
we
came
to
the
post
you
not
going
up
are
you
i
asked
you
can
go
yourself
said
falkenberg
sourly
here
take
your
rags
of
but
a
little
way
farther
on
he
slackened
his
pace
and
muttered
it
a
wicked
shame
to
throw
away
a
chance
like
that
why
it
just
cut
out
for
us
as
it
well
then
why
do
you
go
up
and
pay
them
a
call
who
knows
you
might
be
some
relation
after
i
wish
i
thought
to
ask
if
he
a
nephew
in
what
then
could
you
talk
english
to
them
if
he
had
you
mind
your
own
business
and
do
talk
so
much
said
falkenberg
i
do
see
what
you
got
to
brag
about
he
was
nervous
and
out
of
temper
and
began
stepping
out
then
suddenly
he
stopped
and
said
i
do
it
lend
me
that
pipe
of
yours
again
i
wo
light
we
walked
up
the
hill
falkenberg
putting
on
mighty
airs
pointing
this
way
and
that
with
the
pipe
and
criticizing
the
place
it
annoyed
me
somewhat
to
see
him
stalking
along
in
that
vainglorious
fashion
while
i
carried
the
load
i
said
going
to
be
a
this
time
i
think
i
shown
i
can
tune
a
piano
he
said
shortly
i
am
good
for
that
at
any
but
suppose
there
some
one
in
the
house
knows
all
about
it
fruen
for
instance
and
tries
the
piano
after
you
done
falkenberg
was
silent
i
could
see
he
was
growing
doubtful
again
little
by
little
his
lordly
gait
sank
to
a
slouching
walk
perhaps
we
better
not
he
said
here
take
your
pipe
we
just
go
up
and
simply
ask
for
xv
as
it
happened
there
was
a
chance
for
us
to
make
ourselves
useful
the
moment
we
came
on
the
place
they
were
getting
up
a
new
flagstaff
and
were
short
of
hands
we
set
to
work
and
got
it
up
in
fine
style
there
was
a
crowd
of
women
looking
on
from
the
window
was
captain
falkenberg
at
home
no
or
fruen
fruen
came
out
she
was
tall
and
fair
and
friendly
as
a
young
foal
and
she
answered
our
greeting
in
the
kindliest
way
had
she
any
work
for
us
now
well
i
do
know
i
do
think
so
really
not
while
my
i
had
an
idea
she
found
it
hard
to
say
no
and
touched
my
cap
and
was
turning
away
not
to
trouble
her
any
more
but
she
must
have
found
something
strange
about
falkenberg
coming
up
like
that
wearing
decent
clothes
and
with
a
man
to
carry
his
things
she
looked
at
him
inquisitively
and
asked
what
sort
of
work
any
kind
of
outdoor
work
said
falkenberg
we
can
take
on
hedging
and
ditching
bricklayer
work
getting
late
in
the
year
for
that
sort
put
in
one
of
the
men
by
the
flagstaff
yes
i
suppose
it
is
fruen
agreed
i
do
know
anyhow
just
if
you
like
to
go
in
and
get
something
to
eat
meanwhile
such
as
it
thank
you
kindly
answered
falkenberg
now
that
seemed
to
my
mind
a
poor
and
vulgar
way
to
speak
i
felt
he
shamed
us
both
in
answering
so
and
it
distressed
me
so
i
must
put
in
a
word
myself
mille
grâces
madame
vous
êtes
trop
i
said
gallantly
and
took
off
my
cap
fruen
turned
round
and
stared
at
me
in
astonishment
the
look
on
her
face
was
comical
to
see
we
were
shown
into
the
kitchen
and
given
an
excellent
meal
fruen
went
indoors
when
we
had
finished
and
were
starting
off
she
came
out
again
falkenberg
had
got
back
his
courage
now
and
taking
advantage
of
her
kindness
offered
to
tune
the
piano
can
you
tune
pianos
too
she
asked
in
surprise
yes
indeed
i
tuned
the
one
on
the
farm
down
mine
a
grand
piano
and
a
good
one
i
should
like
it
fruen
can
be
easy
about
have
you
any
sort
of
i
no
certificate
no
it
not
my
way
to
ask
for
such
but
fruen
can
come
and
hear
well
perhaps
yes
come
this
she
went
into
the
house
and
he
followed
i
looked
through
the
doorway
as
they
went
in
and
saw
a
room
with
many
pictures
on
the
walls
the
maids
fussed
about
in
and
out
of
the
kitchen
casting
curious
glances
at
me
stranger
as
i
was
one
of
the
girls
was
quite
i
was
thankful
i
had
shaved
that
morning
some
ten
minutes
passed
falkenberg
had
begun
fruen
came
out
into
the
kitchen
again
and
said
and
to
think
you
speak
french
it
more
than
i
now
heaven
be
thanked
for
that
i
had
no
wish
to
go
farther
with
it
myself
if
i
had
it
would
have
been
mostly
hackneyed
stuff
about
returning
to
our
muttons
and
looking
for
the
lady
in
the
case
and
the
state
that
me
and
so
on
your
friend
showed
me
his
papers
said
fruen
you
seem
to
be
decent
folk
i
do
know
i
might
telegraph
to
my
husband
and
ask
if
any
work
for
i
would
have
thanked
her
but
could
not
get
a
word
out
for
swallowing
at
something
in
my
throat
neurasthenia
afterwards
i
went
out
across
the
yard
and
walked
about
the
fields
a
bit
all
was
in
good
order
everywhere
and
the
crops
in
under
cover
even
the
potato
stalks
had
been
carted
away
though
there
many
places
where
they
left
out
till
the
snow
comes
i
could
see
nothing
for
us
to
do
at
all
evidently
these
people
were
when
it
was
getting
towards
evening
and
falkenberg
was
still
tuning
i
took
a
bit
of
something
to
eat
in
my
pocket
and
went
off
for
a
walk
to
be
out
of
the
way
so
they
should
not
ask
me
in
to
supper
there
was
a
moon
and
the
stars
were
out
but
i
liked
best
to
grope
my
way
into
the
dense
part
of
the
wood
and
sit
down
in
the
dark
it
was
more
sheltered
there
too
how
quiet
the
earth
and
air
seemed
now
the
cold
is
beginning
there
is
rime
on
the
ground
now
and
again
a
stalk
of
grass
creaks
faintly
a
little
mouse
squeaks
a
rook
comes
soaring
over
the
treetops
then
all
is
quiet
again
was
there
ever
such
fair
hair
as
hers
surely
never
born
a
wonder
from
top
to
toe
her
lips
a
ripened
loveliness
and
the
play
of
dragonflies
in
her
hair
if
only
one
could
draw
out
a
diadem
from
a
sack
of
clothes
and
give
it
her
i
find
a
pink
shell
somewhere
and
carve
it
to
a
thumbnail
and
offer
her
the
pipe
to
give
her
husband
for
a
present
yes
falkenberg
comes
across
the
yard
to
meet
me
and
whispers
hurriedly
she
got
an
answer
from
the
captain
he
says
we
can
set
to
work
felling
timber
in
the
woods
are
you
any
good
at
that
well
then
go
inside
into
the
kitchen
she
been
asking
for
i
went
in
and
fruen
said
i
wondered
where
you
got
to
sit
down
and
have
something
to
eat
your
supper
where
we
food
with
us
in
the
well
there
was
no
need
to
do
that
wo
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
then
nothing
i
had
an
answer
from
my
husband
can
you
fell
trees
well
that
all
right
look
here
it
is
couple
of
men
felling
timber
petter
will
show
trees
marked
heaven
she
stood
there
beside
me
pointing
to
the
message
and
the
scent
of
a
young
girl
in
her
breath
xvi
in
the
woods
petter
is
one
of
the
he
showed
us
the
way
here
when
we
talked
together
falkenberg
was
not
by
any
means
so
grateful
to
fruen
for
giving
us
work
nothing
to
bow
and
scrape
for
in
that
he
said
it
none
so
easy
to
get
workmen
these
falkenberg
by
the
way
was
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
in
the
woodcutting
line
while
had
some
experience
of
the
work
in
another
part
of
the
world
and
so
could
take
a
lead
in
this
at
a
finish
and
he
agreed
i
was
to
be
leader
just
now
i
began
working
in
my
mind
on
an
invention
with
the
ordinary
sort
of
saw
now
in
use
the
men
have
to
lie
down
crookedwise
on
the
ground
and
pull
and
that
why
not
so
much
gets
done
in
a
day
and
a
deal
of
ugly
stumps
left
after
in
the
woods
now
with
a
conical
transmission
apparatus
that
could
be
screwed
on
to
the
root
it
should
be
possible
to
work
the
saw
with
a
straight
movement
but
the
blade
cutting
horizontally
all
the
time
i
set
to
work
designing
parts
of
a
machine
of
this
sort
the
thing
that
puzzled
me
most
was
how
to
get
the
little
touch
of
pressure
on
the
blade
that
needed
it
might
be
done
by
means
of
a
spring
that
could
be
wound
up
by
clockwork
or
perhaps
a
weight
would
do
it
the
weight
would
be
easier
but
uniform
and
as
the
saw
went
deeper
it
would
be
getting
harder
all
the
time
and
the
same
pressure
would
not
do
a
steel
spring
on
the
other
hand
would
slacken
down
as
the
cut
grew
deeper
and
always
give
the
right
amount
of
pressure
i
decided
on
the
spring
system
you
can
manage
it
i
told
myself
and
the
credit
for
it
would
be
the
greatest
thing
in
my
life
the
days
passed
one
like
another
we
felled
our
timber
and
cut
off
twigs
and
tops
we
lived
in
plenty
taking
food
and
coffee
with
us
when
we
started
for
the
woods
and
getting
a
hot
meal
in
the
evening
when
we
came
home
then
we
washed
and
tidied
ourselves
to
be
than
the
and
sat
in
the
kitchen
with
a
big
lamp
alight
and
three
girls
falkenberg
had
become
emma
sweetheart
and
every
now
and
then
there
would
come
a
wave
of
music
from
the
piano
in
the
parlour
sometimes
fruen
herself
would
come
out
to
us
with
her
girlish
youth
and
her
blessed
kindly
ways
and
how
did
you
get
on
today
she
would
ask
did
you
meet
a
bear
in
the
woods
but
one
evening
she
thanked
falkenberg
for
doing
her
piano
so
nicely
what
did
she
mean
it
falkenberg
face
grew
quite
handsome
with
pleasure
i
felt
proud
of
him
when
he
answered
modestly
that
he
thought
himself
it
was
a
little
better
now
either
he
had
gained
by
his
experience
in
tuning
already
or
fruen
was
grateful
to
him
for
not
having
spoiled
the
grand
piano
falkenberg
dressed
up
in
my
town
clothes
every
evening
it
do
for
me
to
take
them
back
now
and
wear
them
myself
every
one
would
believe
i
borrowed
them
from
him
let
me
have
emma
and
you
can
keep
the
clothes
i
said
in
jest
all
right
you
can
take
her
he
answered
i
began
to
see
then
that
falkenberg
was
growing
cooler
towards
his
girl
oh
but
falkenberg
had
fallen
in
love
too
the
same
as
i
what
simple
boys
we
were
wonder
if
she
will
give
us
a
look
in
this
evening
again
falkenberg
would
say
while
we
were
out
at
work
and
i
would
answer
that
i
did
care
how
long
the
captain
stayed
away
no
you
right
said
falkenberg
and
i
say
if
i
find
he
decent
to
her
there
be
then
one
evening
falkenberg
gave
us
a
song
and
i
was
proud
of
him
as
ever
fruen
came
out
and
he
had
to
sing
it
over
again
and
another
one
after
his
fine
voice
filled
the
room
and
fruen
was
delighted
and
said
she
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
and
then
it
was
i
began
to
be
envious
have
you
learnt
singing
asked
fruen
can
you
read
music
at
all
yes
indeed
said
falkenberg
i
used
to
sing
in
a
now
that
was
where
he
should
have
said
no
worse
luck
he
never
learned
so
i
thought
to
myself
have
you
ever
sung
to
any
one
has
any
one
ever
heard
you
i
sung
at
dances
and
parties
now
and
again
and
once
at
a
but
i
mean
for
any
one
that
knew
has
any
one
tried
your
voice
no
not
that
i
know
of
or
yes
i
think
so
well
wo
you
sing
some
more
now
and
falkenberg
sang
the
end
of
it
be
he
be
asked
right
into
the
parlour
one
evening
i
thought
to
myself
with
fruen
to
play
for
him
i
said
beg
pardon
but
wo
the
captain
be
coming
home
soon
yes
soon
answered
fruen
why
do
you
ask
i
was
only
thinking
about
the
have
you
felled
all
the
trees
that
were
marked
no
not
yet
no
not
by
a
long
way
but
oh
said
fruen
suddenly
as
if
she
had
just
thought
of
something
you
must
have
some
money
yes
of
course
i
grasped
at
that
to
save
myself
and
answered
thank
you
very
falkenberg
said
nothing
well
you
only
to
ask
you
know
and
she
handed
me
the
money
i
had
asked
for
and
what
about
you
nothing
thank
you
all
the
same
answered
falkenberg
heavens
how
i
had
lost
again
fallen
to
earth
again
and
falkenberg
that
shameless
imposter
who
sat
there
playing
the
man
of
property
who
did
need
anything
in
advance
i
would
tear
my
clothes
off
him
that
very
night
and
leave
him
naked
only
of
course
i
did
nothing
of
the
sort
xvii
and
two
days
went
by
if
she
comes
out
again
this
evening
falkenberg
would
say
up
in
the
woods
i
sing
that
one
about
the
poppy
i
forgotten
you
forgotten
emma
too
have
you
i
ask
emma
look
here
i
tell
you
what
it
is
you
just
the
same
as
ever
that
what
you
ho
am
i
yes
inside
i
mean
you
would
mind
taking
emma
right
there
with
fruen
looking
on
but
i
could
do
that
a
lie
i
answered
angrily
you
wo
see
me
tangled
up
in
any
foolery
with
the
girls
as
long
as
i
am
ah
and
i
sha
be
out
at
nights
with
any
one
after
think
come
this
evening
i
forgotten
that
one
about
the
poppy
till
now
just
falkenberg
sang
the
poppy
song
you
lucky
being
able
to
sing
like
that
i
said
but
neither
of
us
get
her
for
all
get
her
why
whoever
thought
what
a
fool
you
are
ah
if
i
were
young
and
rich
and
handsome
i
win
her
all
the
same
i
said
if
and
if
so
could
i
for
the
matter
of
that
but
there
the
yes
and
then
there
you
and
then
there
me
and
then
herself
and
everybody
else
in
the
world
and
we
a
couple
of
brutes
to
be
talking
about
her
like
this
at
all
said
i
furious
now
with
myself
for
my
own
part
a
nice
thing
indeed
for
two
old
woodcutters
to
speak
of
their
mistress
we
grew
pale
and
thin
the
pair
of
us
and
the
wrinkles
showed
up
in
falkenberg
drawn
face
neither
of
us
could
eat
as
we
used
and
by
way
of
trying
to
hide
our
troubles
from
each
other
i
went
about
talking
all
sorts
of
cheerful
nonsense
while
falkenberg
bragged
loudly
at
every
meal
of
how
he
got
to
eating
too
much
of
late
and
was
getting
slack
and
out
of
form
why
you
do
seem
to
eat
anything
at
all
fruen
would
say
when
we
came
home
with
too
much
left
of
the
food
we
had
taken
with
us
nice
woodcutters
it
falkenberg
that
wo
eat
said
i
ho
indeed
said
falkenberg
i
like
that
given
up
eating
now
and
again
when
she
asked
us
to
do
her
a
favour
some
little
service
or
other
we
would
both
hurry
to
do
it
at
last
we
got
to
bringing
in
water
and
firewood
of
our
own
accord
but
one
day
falkenberg
played
me
a
mean
trick
he
came
home
with
a
bunch
of
hazel
twigs
for
a
that
fruen
had
asked
me
expressly
to
cut
for
her
and
he
sang
every
evening
now
then
it
was
i
resolved
to
make
fruen
jealous
ey
ey
my
good
man
are
you
mad
now
or
merely
foolish
as
if
fruen
would
ever
give
it
as
much
as
a
thought
whatever
you
did
but
so
it
was
i
would
try
to
make
her
jealous
of
the
three
girls
on
the
place
there
was
only
one
that
could
possibly
be
used
for
the
experiment
and
that
was
emma
so
i
started
talking
nonsense
to
emma
emma
i
know
of
some
one
that
is
sighing
for
and
where
did
you
get
to
know
of
that
pray
from
the
stars
i
rather
hear
of
it
from
some
one
here
on
i
can
tell
you
that
too
at
first
it
himself
he
means
put
in
falkenberg
anxious
to
keep
well
out
of
it
well
and
i
do
mind
saying
it
is
cor
but
emma
was
ungracious
and
did
care
to
talk
to
me
for
all
i
was
better
at
languages
than
falkenberg
what
could
i
not
even
master
emma
well
i
turned
proud
and
silent
after
that
and
went
my
own
ways
making
drawings
for
that
machine
of
mine
and
little
models
and
when
falkenberg
was
singing
of
an
evening
and
fruen
listening
i
went
across
to
the
men
quarters
and
stayed
there
with
them
which
of
course
was
much
more
dignified
the
only
trouble
about
it
was
that
petter
was
ill
in
bed
and
could
stand
the
noise
of
ax
and
hammer
so
i
had
to
go
outside
every
time
i
any
heavy
piece
of
work
to
do
still
now
and
again
i
fancied
fruen
might
perhaps
be
sorry
after
all
at
missing
my
company
in
the
kitchen
it
looked
so
to
me
one
evening
when
we
were
at
supper
she
turned
to
me
and
said
what
that
the
men
were
saying
about
a
new
machine
you
making
it
a
new
kind
of
saw
he
messing
about
with
said
falkenberg
but
it
too
heavy
to
be
any
i
made
no
answer
to
that
but
craftily
preferred
to
be
wronged
was
it
not
the
fate
of
all
inventors
to
be
so
misjudged
only
wait
my
time
was
not
yet
come
there
were
moments
when
i
could
hardly
keep
from
bursting
out
with
a
revelation
to
the
girls
of
how
i
was
really
a
man
of
good
family
led
astray
by
desperation
over
an
unhappy
love
affair
and
now
taking
to
drink
alas
yes
man
proposes
god
disposes
and
then
perhaps
fruen
herself
might
come
to
hear
of
it
i
think
i
take
to
going
over
with
the
men
in
the
evenings
said
falkenberg
the
same
as
and
i
knew
well
enough
why
falkenberg
had
suddenly
taken
it
into
his
head
to
spend
his
evenings
there
he
was
not
asked
to
sing
now
as
often
as
before
some
way
or
other
he
was
less
in
demand
of
late
xviii
the
captain
had
returned
a
big
man
with
a
full
beard
came
out
to
us
one
day
while
we
were
at
work
and
said
i
captain
falkenberg
well
lads
how
goes
it
we
greeted
him
respectfully
and
answered
well
then
there
was
some
talk
of
what
we
had
done
and
what
remained
to
do
the
captain
was
pleased
with
our
work
all
clean
cut
and
close
to
the
root
then
he
reckoned
out
how
much
we
had
got
through
per
day
and
said
it
came
to
a
good
average
captain
forgetting
said
i
that
true
said
he
well
that
makes
it
over
the
average
had
any
trouble
at
all
with
the
tools
is
the
saw
all
right
quite
all
and
nobody
hurt
pause
you
ought
by
rights
to
provide
your
own
food
he
said
but
if
you
would
rather
have
it
the
other
way
we
can
square
it
when
we
come
to
settle
we
be
glad
to
have
it
as
captain
thinks
yes
agreed
falkenberg
as
well
the
captain
took
a
turn
up
through
the
wood
and
came
back
again
could
have
better
weather
he
said
no
snow
to
shovel
no
there
no
snow
that
true
but
a
little
more
frost
do
no
why
cooler
to
work
in
mean
that
too
perhaps
yes
but
the
saw
cuts
easier
when
timber
you
an
old
hand
at
this
work
then
and
are
you
the
one
that
sings
no
more
the
pity
he
is
the
one
that
oh
so
you
are
the
singer
are
you
we
namesakes
i
believe
why
yes
in
a
way
said
falkenberg
a
little
awkwardly
my
name
is
lars
falkenberg
and
i
my
certificate
to
show
for
what
part
come
from
from
the
captain
went
home
he
was
friendly
enough
but
spoke
in
a
short
decisive
way
with
never
a
smile
or
a
jesting
word
a
good
face
something
ordinary
from
that
day
onwards
falkenberg
never
sang
but
in
the
men
quarters
or
out
in
the
open
no
more
singing
in
the
kitchen
now
the
captain
had
come
home
falkenberg
was
irritable
and
gloomy
he
would
swear
at
times
and
say
life
was
worth
living
these
days
a
man
might
as
well
go
and
hang
himself
and
have
done
with
it
but
his
fit
of
despair
soon
came
to
an
end
one
sunday
he
went
back
to
the
two
farms
where
he
had
tuned
the
pianos
and
asked
for
a
recommendation
from
each
when
he
came
back
he
showed
me
the
papers
and
said
they
do
to
keep
going
with
for
a
then
you
not
going
to
hang
yourself
after
all
you
better
cause
to
go
that
way
if
you
ask
me
said
falkenberg
but
i
too
was
less
despairing
now
when
the
captain
heard
about
my
machine
idea
he
wanted
to
know
more
about
it
at
once
he
saw
at
the
first
glance
that
my
drawings
were
far
from
perfect
being
made
on
small
pieces
of
paper
and
without
so
much
as
a
pair
of
dividers
to
work
with
he
lent
me
a
set
of
drawing
instruments
and
gave
me
some
useful
hints
about
how
such
things
were
done
he
too
was
afraid
my
saw
would
prove
too
cumbersome
but
keep
on
with
it
anyway
he
said
get
the
whole
thing
drawn
to
a
definite
scale
then
we
can
i
realized
however
that
a
decently
constructed
model
of
the
thing
would
give
a
better
idea
of
it
and
as
soon
as
i
was
through
with
the
drawings
i
set
to
work
carving
a
model
in
wood
i
had
no
lathe
and
had
to
whittle
out
the
two
rollers
and
several
wheels
and
screws
by
hand
i
was
working
at
this
on
the
sunday
and
so
taken
up
with
it
i
never
heard
the
the
captain
came
out
and
called
dinner
then
when
he
saw
what
i
was
doing
he
offered
to
drive
over
himself
to
the
smithy
the
very
next
day
and
get
the
parts
i
needed
cut
on
the
lathe
all
you
need
do
is
to
give
me
the
measurements
he
said
and
you
must
want
some
tools
surely
saw
and
drills
right
screws
yes
and
a
fine
chisel
is
that
all
he
made
a
note
of
the
things
on
the
spot
a
man
to
work
under
but
in
the
evening
when
i
had
finished
supper
and
was
crossing
the
courtyard
to
the
men
room
fruen
called
me
she
was
standing
between
the
kitchen
windows
in
the
shadow
but
slipped
forward
now
my
husband
said
he
said
you
ca
be
warm
enough
in
these
thin
clothes
she
said
and
would
you
here
take
she
bundled
a
whole
suit
into
my
arms
i
thanked
her
stammering
foolishly
i
was
going
to
get
myself
some
new
things
soon
there
was
no
hurry
i
did
need
of
course
i
know
you
can
get
things
yourself
but
when
your
friend
is
so
so
oh
take
and
she
ran
away
indoors
again
the
very
fashion
of
a
young
girl
fearing
to
be
caught
doing
something
i
had
to
call
my
last
thanks
after
her
when
the
captain
came
out
next
evening
with
my
wheels
and
rollers
i
took
the
opportunity
of
thanking
him
for
the
clothes
oh
er
yes
he
answered
it
was
my
wife
that
do
they
fit
you
all
right
yes
many
that
all
right
then
yes
it
was
my
wife
that
well
here
are
the
things
for
your
machine
and
the
tools
it
seemed
then
as
if
the
two
of
them
were
equally
ready
to
do
an
act
of
kindness
and
when
it
was
done
each
would
lay
the
blame
on
the
other
surely
this
must
be
the
perfect
wedded
life
that
dreamers
dreamed
of
here
on
earth
xix
the
woods
are
stripped
of
leaf
now
and
the
bird
sounds
are
gone
only
the
crows
rasp
out
their
screeching
note
at
five
in
the
morning
when
they
spread
out
over
the
fields
we
see
them
falkenberg
and
i
as
we
go
to
our
work
the
yearling
birds
that
have
not
yet
learned
fear
of
the
world
hop
along
the
path
before
our
feet
then
we
meet
the
finch
the
sparrow
of
the
timbered
lands
he
has
been
out
in
the
woods
already
and
is
coming
back
now
to
humankind
that
he
likes
to
live
with
and
study
from
all
sides
queer
little
finch
a
bird
of
passage
really
but
his
parents
have
taught
him
that
one
spend
a
winter
in
the
north
and
now
he
will
teach
his
children
that
the
north
the
only
place
to
spend
the
winter
in
at
all
but
there
is
still
a
touch
of
emigrant
blood
in
him
and
he
remains
a
wanderer
one
day
he
and
his
will
gather
together
and
set
off
for
somewhere
else
many
parishes
away
to
study
a
new
collection
of
humans
there
and
in
the
aspen
grove
never
a
finch
to
be
seen
and
it
may
be
a
whole
week
before
a
new
flock
of
this
winged
life
appears
and
settles
in
the
same
place
how
many
a
time
have
i
watched
the
finches
in
their
doings
and
found
pleasure
in
all
one
day
falkenberg
declares
he
is
all
right
again
now
going
to
save
up
and
put
aside
a
hundred
kroner
this
winter
out
of
tuning
pianos
and
felling
trees
and
then
make
up
again
with
emma
i
too
he
suggests
would
be
better
advised
to
give
over
sighing
for
ladies
of
high
degree
and
go
back
to
my
own
rank
and
station
falkenberg
was
right
on
saturday
evening
we
stopped
work
a
trifle
earlier
than
usual
to
go
up
and
get
some
things
from
the
store
we
wanted
shirts
tobacco
and
wine
while
we
were
in
the
store
i
caught
sight
of
a
little
ornamented
with
shells
of
the
kind
seafaring
men
used
to
buy
in
the
old
days
at
amsterdam
and
bring
home
to
their
girls
now
the
germans
make
them
by
the
thousand
i
bought
the
workbox
with
the
idea
of
taking
out
one
of
the
shells
to
serve
as
a
thumbnail
for
my
pipe
what
want
with
a
workbox
asked
falkenberg
is
it
for
emma
what
he
grew
jealous
at
the
thought
and
not
to
be
outdone
he
bought
a
silk
handkerchief
to
give
her
himself
on
the
way
back
we
sampled
the
wine
and
got
talking
falkenberg
was
still
jealous
so
i
took
out
the
workbox
chose
the
shell
i
wanted
and
picked
it
off
and
gave
him
the
box
after
that
we
were
friends
again
it
was
getting
dark
now
and
there
was
no
moon
suddenly
we
heard
the
sound
of
a
concertina
from
a
house
up
on
a
hillside
we
could
see
there
was
dancing
within
from
the
way
the
light
came
and
went
like
a
lighthouse
beam
let
go
up
and
look
said
falkenberg
coming
up
to
the
house
we
found
a
little
group
of
lads
and
girls
outside
taking
the
air
emma
was
there
as
well
why
there
emma
cried
falkenberg
cheerily
not
in
the
least
put
out
to
find
she
had
gone
without
him
emma
here
i
got
something
for
you
he
reckoned
to
make
all
good
with
a
word
but
emma
turned
away
from
him
and
went
indoors
then
when
he
moved
to
go
after
her
others
barred
his
way
hinting
pretty
plainly
that
he
was
wanted
there
but
emma
is
there
ask
her
to
come
emma
not
coming
out
she
here
with
markus
falkenberg
stood
there
helpless
he
had
been
cold
to
emma
now
for
so
long
that
she
had
given
him
up
and
seeing
him
stand
there
stupidly
agape
some
of
the
girls
began
to
make
game
of
him
had
she
left
him
all
alone
then
and
what
would
he
ever
do
now
poor
fellow
falkenberg
set
his
bottle
to
his
lips
and
drank
before
the
eyes
of
all
then
wiped
his
mouth
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
passed
to
the
nearest
man
there
was
a
better
feeling
now
towards
us
we
were
good
fellows
with
bottles
in
our
pockets
and
willing
to
pass
them
round
moreover
we
were
strangers
in
the
place
and
that
was
always
something
new
also
falkenberg
said
many
humorous
things
of
markus
shoemaker
whom
he
persisted
in
calling
lukas
the
dance
was
still
going
on
inside
but
none
of
the
girls
left
us
to
go
in
and
join
i
bet
you
now
said
falkenberg
with
a
swagger
that
emma
be
only
too
glad
to
be
out
here
with
helene
and
rønnaug
and
sara
were
there
every
time
they
drank
they
gave
their
hands
prettily
by
way
of
thanks
as
the
custom
is
but
some
of
the
others
that
had
learned
a
trifle
of
town
manners
said
only
for
and
no
more
helene
was
to
be
falkenberg
girl
it
seemed
he
put
his
arm
round
her
waist
and
said
she
was
his
for
tonight
and
when
they
moved
off
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
rest
of
us
none
called
to
them
to
come
back
we
paired
off
all
of
us
after
a
while
and
went
our
separate
ways
into
the
woods
i
went
with
sara
when
we
came
out
from
the
wood
again
there
stood
rønnaug
still
taking
the
air
strange
girl
had
she
been
standing
there
alone
all
the
time
i
took
her
hand
and
talked
to
her
a
little
but
she
only
smiled
to
all
i
said
and
made
no
answer
we
went
off
towards
the
wood
and
sara
called
after
us
in
the
darkness
rønnaug
come
now
and
let
go
but
rønnaug
made
no
answer
it
was
little
she
said
at
all
soft
white
as
milk
and
tall
and
still
xx
the
first
snow
is
come
it
thaws
again
at
once
but
winter
is
not
far
off
and
we
are
nearing
the
end
of
our
woodcutting
now
at
øvrebø
another
week
or
so
perhaps
no
more
what
then
there
was
work
on
the
railway
line
up
on
the
hills
or
perhaps
more
woodcutting
at
some
other
place
we
might
come
to
falkenberg
was
for
trying
the
railway
but
i
could
get
done
with
my
machine
in
so
short
a
time
we
each
our
own
affairs
to
take
our
time
apart
from
the
machine
there
was
that
thumbnail
for
the
pipe
i
wanted
to
finish
and
the
evenings
came
out
all
too
short
as
for
falkenberg
he
had
made
it
up
with
emma
again
and
that
was
a
difficult
matter
and
took
time
she
had
been
going
about
with
markus
shoemaker
was
true
but
falkenberg
for
his
part
could
not
deny
having
given
helene
presents
a
silk
handkerchief
and
a
work
box
set
with
shells
falkenberg
was
troubled
and
said
everything
is
wrong
somehow
nothing
but
bother
and
worry
and
why
as
to
that
that
what
i
call
it
anyway
if
you
want
to
know
she
wo
come
up
in
the
hills
as
we
it
be
markus
shoemaker
then
that
keeping
her
back
falkenberg
was
gloomily
silent
then
after
a
pause
they
would
even
have
me
go
on
we
got
to
talking
of
the
captain
and
his
wife
falkenberg
had
an
all
was
not
as
it
might
be
between
them
gossiping
fool
i
put
in
a
word
you
excuse
me
but
you
do
know
what
you
are
talking
ho
said
he
angrily
and
growing
more
and
more
excited
he
went
on
have
you
ever
seen
them
now
hanging
about
after
each
other
never
heard
them
say
so
much
as
a
the
fool
the
churl
do
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
the
way
you
sawing
look
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
cut
me
we
two
of
us
in
it
anyway
so
good
then
we
say
it
the
thaw
let
get
back
to
the
ax
we
went
on
working
each
by
himself
for
a
while
angered
and
out
of
humour
both
what
was
the
lie
he
had
dared
to
say
of
them
that
they
never
so
much
as
spoke
to
each
other
but
heaven
he
was
right
falkenberg
had
a
keen
scent
for
such
things
he
knew
something
of
men
and
women
at
any
rate
they
speak
nicely
of
each
other
to
us
i
said
falkenberg
went
on
with
his
work
i
thought
over
the
whole
thing
again
well
perhaps
you
may
be
right
as
far
as
that
goes
that
it
not
the
wedded
life
dreamers
have
dreamed
of
still
but
it
was
no
good
talking
to
falkenberg
in
that
style
he
understood
never
a
word
when
we
stopped
work
at
noon
i
took
up
the
talk
again
did
you
say
once
if
he
was
decent
to
her
there
be
trouble
yes
i
well
there
has
been
did
i
ever
say
he
was
decent
to
her
said
falkenberg
irritably
no
but
they
sick
and
wearied
of
each
other
that
what
it
is
when
one
comes
in
the
other
goes
out
whenever
he
starts
talking
of
anything
out
in
the
kitchen
her
eyes
go
all
dead
and
dull
and
she
we
got
to
work
again
with
the
ax
each
thinking
his
own
ways
i
doubt
but
i
need
to
give
him
a
thrashing
said
falkenberg
who
lukas
i
got
my
pipe
done
and
sent
emma
in
with
it
to
the
captain
the
nail
had
turned
out
fine
and
natural
this
time
and
with
the
fine
tools
i
had
now
i
was
able
to
cut
well
down
into
the
thumb
and
fasten
it
on
the
underside
so
that
the
two
little
copper
pins
would
not
show
i
was
pleased
enough
with
the
work
the
captain
came
out
while
we
were
at
supper
that
evening
to
thank
me
for
the
pipe
at
the
same
time
i
noticed
that
falkenberg
was
right
no
sooner
had
the
captain
come
out
than
fruen
went
in
the
captain
praised
my
pipe
and
asked
how
i
had
managed
to
fix
the
nail
he
said
i
was
an
artist
and
a
master
all
the
others
were
standing
by
and
heard
his
words
and
it
counted
for
something
to
be
called
an
artist
by
the
captain
himself
i
believe
i
could
have
won
emma
at
that
moment
that
night
i
learned
to
shiver
and
shake
the
corpse
of
a
woman
came
up
to
me
where
i
lay
in
the
loft
and
stretched
out
its
left
hand
to
show
me
the
thumbnail
was
missing
i
shook
my
head
to
say
i
had
had
a
thumbnail
once
but
i
had
thrown
it
away
and
used
a
shell
instead
but
the
corpse
stood
there
all
the
same
and
there
i
lay
shivering
cold
with
fear
then
i
managed
to
say
i
could
help
it
now
in
god
name
go
away
and
our
father
which
art
in
heaven
the
corpse
came
straight
towards
me
i
thrust
out
two
clenched
fists
and
gave
an
icy
shriek
and
there
i
was
crushing
falkenberg
flat
against
the
wall
what
is
it
cried
falkenberg
in
heaven
name
i
woke
dripping
with
sweat
and
lay
there
with
open
eyes
watching
the
corpse
as
it
vanished
quite
slowly
in
the
dark
of
the
room
it
the
corpse
i
groaned
come
to
ask
for
her
falkenberg
sat
straight
up
in
bed
wide
awake
all
at
once
i
saw
her
he
said
did
you
see
her
too
did
you
see
her
thumb
ugh
i
would
be
in
your
shoes
now
for
let
me
lie
inside
against
the
wall
i
begged
and
what
about
me
it
wo
hurt
you
you
can
lie
outside
all
and
let
her
come
and
take
me
first
not
if
i
know
and
at
that
falkenberg
lay
down
again
and
pulled
the
rug
over
his
eyes
i
thought
for
a
moment
of
going
down
to
sleep
with
petter
he
was
getting
better
now
and
there
was
no
fear
of
infection
but
i
was
afraid
to
go
down
the
stairs
it
was
a
terrible
night
next
morning
i
searched
high
and
low
for
the
nail
and
found
it
on
the
floor
at
last
among
the
shavings
and
sawdust
i
took
it
out
and
buried
it
on
the
way
to
the
wood
it
a
question
if
you
ought
to
carry
it
back
where
you
took
it
from
said
falkenberg
why
that
miles
away
a
whole
long
journey
they
wo
ask
about
that
if
you
called
to
do
it
maybe
she
care
about
having
a
thumb
one
place
and
a
thumbnail
in
but
i
was
brave
enough
now
a
very
desperado
in
the
daylight
i
laughed
at
falkenberg
for
his
superstition
and
told
him
science
had
disposed
of
all
such
nonsense
long
ago
xxi
one
evening
there
came
visitors
to
the
place
and
as
petter
was
still
poorly
and
the
other
lad
was
only
a
youngster
i
had
to
go
and
take
out
the
horses
a
lady
got
out
of
the
carriage
is
any
one
at
home
she
asked
the
sound
of
wheels
had
brought
faces
to
the
windows
lamps
were
lit
in
the
rooms
and
passages
fruen
came
out
calling
is
that
you
elisabeth
i
so
glad
you
it
was
frøken
elisabeth
from
the
vicarage
is
here
she
asked
in
surprise
who
it
was
myself
she
meant
so
she
had
recognized
me
next
day
the
two
young
ladies
came
out
to
us
in
the
wood
at
first
i
was
afraid
lest
some
rumour
of
a
certain
nightly
ride
on
borrowed
horses
should
have
reached
the
vicarage
but
calmed
myself
when
nothing
was
said
of
it
the
are
doing
nicely
said
frøken
elisabeth
i
was
pleased
to
hear
it
said
fruen
inquiringly
he
laid
on
a
to
the
house
for
us
pipes
in
the
kitchen
and
upstairs
as
well
just
turn
a
tap
and
there
it
is
you
ought
to
have
it
done
really
though
could
it
be
done
here
do
you
think
i
answered
yes
it
ought
to
be
easy
enough
why
did
you
speak
to
my
husband
about
it
i
did
speak
of
it
he
said
he
would
see
what
fruen
thought
about
awkward
pause
so
he
would
not
speak
to
her
even
of
a
thing
that
so
nearly
concerned
herself
i
hastened
to
break
the
silence
and
said
at
random
anyhow
it
too
late
to
start
this
year
the
winter
would
be
on
us
before
we
could
get
it
done
but
next
spring
fruen
seemed
to
come
back
to
attention
from
somewhere
far
away
oh
yes
i
remember
now
he
did
say
something
about
it
she
said
we
talked
it
over
but
it
was
too
late
this
year
elisabeth
do
you
like
watching
them
felling
trees
we
used
a
rope
now
and
then
to
guide
the
tree
in
its
fall
falkenberg
had
just
fixed
this
rope
high
up
and
the
tree
stood
swaying
what
that
for
to
make
it
fall
the
right
way
i
began
but
fruen
did
not
care
to
listen
to
me
any
more
she
turned
to
falkenberg
and
put
the
question
to
him
directly
does
it
matter
which
way
it
falls
falkenberg
had
to
answer
her
why
no
we
need
to
guide
it
a
bit
so
it
does
break
down
too
much
of
the
young
growth
when
it
did
you
notice
said
fruen
to
her
friend
what
a
voice
he
has
the
one
that
how
i
hated
myself
now
for
having
talked
so
much
instead
of
reading
her
wish
but
at
least
i
would
show
her
that
i
understood
the
hint
and
moreover
it
was
frøken
elisabeth
and
no
other
i
was
in
love
with
she
was
not
full
of
changing
humours
and
was
just
as
pretty
as
the
other
ay
a
thousand
times
prettier
i
would
go
and
take
work
at
her
father
place
i
took
care
now
whenever
fruen
spoke
to
look
first
at
falkenberg
and
then
at
her
keeping
back
my
answer
as
if
fearing
to
speak
out
of
my
turn
i
think
too
she
began
to
feel
a
little
sorry
when
she
noticed
this
for
once
she
said
with
a
little
troubled
smile
yes
yes
it
was
you
i
that
smile
with
her
words
then
came
a
whirl
of
joy
at
my
heart
i
began
swinging
the
ax
with
all
the
strength
i
had
gained
from
long
use
and
made
fine
deep
cuts
i
heard
only
a
word
now
and
then
of
what
they
said
they
want
me
to
sing
to
them
this
evening
said
falkenberg
when
they
had
gone
evening
came
i
stood
out
in
the
courtyard
talking
to
the
captain
three
or
four
days
more
and
our
work
on
the
timber
would
be
at
an
end
and
where
will
you
be
going
then
asked
the
captain
we
were
going
to
get
work
on
the
i
might
find
you
something
to
do
here
said
the
captain
i
want
the
drive
down
to
the
high
road
carried
a
different
way
it
too
steep
as
it
is
come
and
see
what
i
he
took
me
round
to
the
south
side
of
the
house
and
pointed
this
way
and
that
though
it
was
already
dark
and
by
the
time
that
done
and
one
or
two
other
little
things
we
shall
be
well
on
to
the
spring
he
said
and
then
there
be
the
water
as
you
said
and
besides
there
petter
laid
up
still
we
get
along
like
this
i
must
have
another
hand
to
suddenly
we
heard
falkenberg
singing
there
was
a
light
in
the
parlour
falkenberg
was
in
there
singing
to
an
accompaniment
on
the
piano
the
music
welled
out
toward
us
the
man
had
a
remarkable
voice
and
made
me
quiver
against
my
will
the
captain
started
and
glanced
up
at
the
windows
no
he
said
suddenly
i
think
after
all
we
better
leave
the
drive
till
next
spring
as
well
how
soon
did
you
say
you
be
through
with
the
timber
three
or
four
good
we
say
three
or
four
days
more
for
that
and
then
finish
for
this
a
strangely
sudden
decision
i
thought
to
myself
and
aloud
i
said
there
no
reason
why
we
should
do
the
road
work
in
winter
better
in
some
ways
there
the
blasting
and
getting
up
the
loads
yes
i
know
but
well
i
think
i
must
go
in
now
and
listen
to
this
the
captain
went
indoors
it
crossed
my
mind
that
he
did
so
out
of
courtesy
wishing
to
make
himself
as
it
were
responsible
for
having
falkenberg
in
the
parlour
but
i
fancied
he
would
rather
have
stayed
talking
with
me
which
was
a
coxcomb
thought
and
altogether
wrong
xxii
i
had
got
the
biggest
parts
of
my
machine
done
and
could
fix
them
together
and
try
it
there
was
an
old
stump
by
the
from
an
aspen
that
had
been
blown
down
i
fixed
my
apparatus
to
that
and
found
at
once
that
the
saw
would
cut
all
right
aha
now
what
have
you
got
to
say
here
the
problem
solved
i
had
bought
a
huge
and
cut
teeth
all
down
the
back
these
teeth
fitted
into
a
little
cogwheel
set
to
take
the
friction
and
driven
forward
by
the
spring
the
spring
itself
i
had
fashioned
originally
from
a
broad
staybusk
emma
had
given
me
but
when
i
came
to
test
it
it
proved
too
weak
so
i
made
another
from
a
only
six
millimetres
across
after
i
had
first
filed
off
the
teeth
this
new
spring
however
was
too
strong
i
had
to
manage
as
best
i
could
by
winding
it
only
up
and
then
when
it
ran
down
up
again
i
knew
too
little
theory
worse
luck
it
was
a
case
of
feeling
my
way
at
every
step
and
this
made
it
a
slow
proceeding
the
conical
gear
for
instance
i
found
too
heavy
when
i
came
to
put
it
into
practice
and
had
to
devise
a
different
system
altogether
it
was
on
a
sunday
that
i
fixed
my
apparatus
to
the
stump
the
new
white
woodwork
and
the
shining
glittered
in
the
sun
soon
faces
appeared
at
the
windows
and
the
captain
himself
came
he
did
not
answer
my
greeting
so
intent
was
he
on
the
machine
well
how
do
you
think
it
will
work
i
set
it
going
upon
my
soul
i
believe
it
will
fruen
and
frøken
elisabeth
came
out
all
the
maids
came
out
falkenberg
came
out
and
i
let
them
see
it
work
aha
what
did
i
say
said
the
captain
presently
wo
it
take
up
too
much
time
fixing
the
apparatus
to
one
tree
after
another
part
of
the
time
will
be
made
up
by
easier
work
no
need
to
keep
stopping
for
why
not
because
the
lateral
pressure
effected
by
the
spring
it
just
that
pressure
that
makes
the
hardest
and
what
about
the
rest
of
the
time
i
going
to
discard
this
arrangement
and
have
a
clamp
instead
that
can
be
pressed
down
by
the
foot
a
clamp
with
teeth
to
give
a
better
grip
and
adjustable
to
any
sized
i
showed
him
a
drawing
of
this
clamp
arrangement
i
had
not
had
time
to
make
the
thing
itself
the
captain
took
a
turn
at
the
saw
himself
noticing
carefully
the
amount
of
force
required
he
said
it
a
question
whether
it
wo
be
too
heavy
pulling
a
saw
twice
the
width
of
an
ordinary
woodcutting
ay
agreed
falkenberg
it
looks
that
all
looked
at
falkenberg
and
then
at
me
it
was
my
turn
now
a
single
man
can
push
a
goods
truck
with
full
load
on
rails
i
said
and
here
there
be
two
men
to
work
a
saw
with
the
blade
running
on
two
rollers
over
oiled
steel
guides
it
be
easier
to
work
than
the
old
type
of
saw
a
single
man
could
work
it
if
it
came
to
a
it
sounds
almost
well
we
shall
frøken
elisabeth
asked
half
in
jest
but
tell
me
i
do
understand
these
things
a
bit
you
know
why
would
it
be
better
to
saw
a
tree
across
in
the
old
way
he
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
lateral
pressure
that
a
strain
on
the
men
working
explained
the
captain
with
a
saw
like
this
you
can
as
he
says
make
a
horizontal
cut
with
the
same
sort
of
pressure
you
would
use
for
an
ordinary
saw
cutting
down
vertically
it
simply
this
you
press
downwards
but
the
pressure
transmitted
sideways
by
the
way
he
went
on
turning
to
me
has
it
struck
you
there
might
be
a
danger
of
pressing
down
the
ends
of
the
blade
and
making
a
convex
cut
that
obviated
in
the
first
place
by
these
rollers
under
the
true
that
goes
for
something
and
in
the
second
place
in
the
second
place
it
would
be
impossible
to
make
a
convex
cut
with
this
apparatus
even
if
you
wanted
to
the
blade
you
see
has
a
back
that
makes
it
practically
impossible
to
bend
i
fancy
the
captain
put
forward
some
of
his
objections
against
his
own
conviction
knowing
all
he
did
he
could
have
answered
them
himself
better
than
i
on
the
other
hand
there
were
points
he
did
not
notice
but
which
caused
me
some
anxiety
a
machine
that
was
to
be
carried
about
in
the
woods
must
not
be
made
with
delicate
mechanism
i
was
afraid
for
instance
that
the
two
steel
guides
might
be
easily
injured
and
either
broken
away
or
so
bent
that
the
wheels
would
jam
no
the
guides
would
have
to
be
dispensed
with
and
the
wheels
set
under
the
back
of
the
saw
altogether
my
machine
was
far
from
complete
the
captain
went
over
to
falkenberg
and
said
i
want
you
to
drive
the
ladies
tomorrow
they
going
some
way
and
petter
not
well
enough
it
seems
do
you
think
you
could
surely
said
falkenberg
and
frøkenen
going
back
to
the
vicarage
said
the
captain
as
he
turned
to
go
you
have
to
be
out
by
six
falkenberg
was
in
high
spirits
at
this
mark
of
confidence
and
jestingly
hinted
that
i
envied
him
the
same
truth
to
tell
i
did
not
envy
him
there
in
the
least
i
was
perhaps
a
little
hurt
to
find
my
comrade
so
preferred
before
myself
but
i
would
most
certainly
stay
here
by
myself
in
the
quiet
of
the
woods
than
sit
on
a
box
and
drive
in
the
cold
falkenberg
was
thoroughly
pleased
with
himself
you
looking
simply
green
with
envy
now
he
said
you
better
take
something
for
it
try
a
little
now
he
was
busy
all
the
forenoon
getting
ready
for
the
journey
washing
down
the
carriage
greasing
the
wheels
and
cleaning
the
harness
after
i
helped
him
with
the
work
i
do
believe
you
can
drive
a
pair
at
all
really
i
said
just
to
annoy
him
but
i
give
you
a
bit
of
a
lesson
if
you
like
before
you
you
got
it
badly
he
answered
it
a
pity
to
see
a
man
looking
like
that
when
a
dose
of
would
put
him
it
was
like
that
all
the
time
jesting
and
merriment
from
one
to
the
other
that
evening
the
captain
came
out
to
me
i
did
want
to
send
you
down
with
the
ladies
he
said
because
of
your
work
but
now
frøken
elisabeth
says
she
wants
you
to
drive
and
not
the
other
me
yes
because
she
knows
why
as
for
that
have
been
safe
enough
as
it
do
you
mind
going
at
all
good
then
that
this
thought
came
to
my
mind
at
once
aha
it
me
the
ladies
fancy
after
all
because
i
an
inventor
and
proprietor
of
a
patent
saw
and
not
bad
looking
when
i
properly
got
up
not
bad
looking
by
any
but
the
captain
explained
things
to
falkenberg
in
an
altogether
different
way
that
upset
my
vanity
completely
frøken
elisabeth
wanted
me
to
go
down
to
the
vicarage
once
more
so
that
her
father
might
have
another
try
at
getting
me
to
take
work
there
she
promised
him
to
do
so
i
thought
and
thought
over
this
explanation
but
if
you
get
taken
on
at
the
vicarage
then
it
all
off
with
our
railway
work
said
falkenberg
i
sha
said
xxiii
i
started
early
in
the
morning
with
the
two
ladies
in
a
closed
carriage
it
was
more
than
a
trifle
cold
at
first
and
my
woollen
rug
came
in
very
handy
i
used
it
alternately
to
put
over
my
knees
and
wrap
round
my
shoulders
we
drove
the
way
i
had
walked
up
with
falkenberg
and
i
recognized
place
after
place
as
we
passed
there
and
there
he
had
tuned
the
pianos
there
we
had
heard
the
grey
goose
passing
the
sun
came
up
and
it
grew
warmer
the
hours
went
by
then
coming
to
the
ladies
knocked
at
the
window
and
said
it
was
i
could
see
by
the
sun
it
was
too
early
for
the
ladies
though
well
enough
for
me
seeing
i
took
my
dinner
with
falkenberg
at
noon
so
i
drove
on
ca
you
stop
they
cried
i
thought
you
do
generally
have
dinner
till
three
but
we
i
turned
off
aside
from
the
road
took
out
the
horses
and
fed
and
watered
them
had
these
strange
beings
set
their
by
mine
but
i
felt
i
could
not
well
sit
down
to
eat
with
them
so
i
remained
standing
by
the
horses
well
said
fruen
thank
you
kindly
said
i
and
waited
to
be
served
they
helped
me
both
of
them
as
if
they
could
never
give
me
enough
i
drew
the
corks
of
the
beer
bottles
and
was
given
a
liberal
share
here
as
well
it
was
a
picnic
by
the
roadside
a
little
wayfaring
adventure
in
my
life
and
fruen
i
dared
look
at
least
for
fear
she
should
be
hurt
and
they
talked
and
jested
with
each
other
and
now
and
again
with
me
out
of
their
kindliness
that
i
might
feel
at
ease
said
frøken
elisabeth
oh
i
think
it
just
lovely
to
have
meals
out
of
doors
do
you
and
here
she
said
instead
of
as
she
had
said
before
it
not
so
new
to
him
you
know
said
fruen
he
has
his
dinner
out
in
the
woods
every
eh
but
that
voice
of
hers
and
her
eyes
and
the
womanly
tender
look
of
the
hand
that
held
the
glass
towards
me
i
might
have
said
something
in
turn
have
told
them
this
or
that
of
strange
things
from
out
in
the
wide
world
for
their
amusement
i
could
have
set
those
ladies
right
when
they
chattered
on
all
ignorant
of
the
way
of
riding
camels
or
of
harvest
in
the
vineyards
i
made
haste
to
finish
my
meal
and
moved
away
i
took
the
buckets
and
went
down
for
more
water
for
the
horses
though
there
was
no
need
i
sat
down
by
the
stream
and
stayed
there
after
a
little
while
fruen
called
you
must
come
and
stand
by
the
horses
we
are
going
off
to
see
if
we
can
find
some
wild
hops
or
something
but
when
i
came
up
they
decided
that
the
wild
hops
were
over
and
there
were
no
rowan
berries
left
now
nor
any
richly
coloured
leaves
there
nothing
in
the
woods
now
said
frøkenen
and
she
spoke
to
me
directly
once
again
well
there
no
churchyard
here
for
you
to
roam
about
you
must
miss
it
i
should
and
then
she
went
on
to
explain
to
fruen
that
i
was
a
curious
person
who
wandered
about
in
graveyards
by
night
and
held
meetings
with
the
dead
and
it
was
there
i
invented
my
machines
and
things
by
way
of
saying
something
i
asked
about
young
erik
he
had
been
thrown
by
a
runaway
horse
and
badly
hurt
he
better
now
said
frøkenen
are
you
ready
to
go
on
again
lovise
yes
indeed
can
we
start
whenever
you
please
i
answered
and
we
drove
on
again
the
hours
pass
the
sun
draws
lower
down
the
sky
and
it
is
cooler
a
chill
in
the
air
then
later
wind
and
wet
half
rain
half
snow
we
passed
the
annexe
church
a
couple
of
wayside
stores
and
farm
after
farm
then
came
a
knocking
on
the
window
of
the
carriage
was
it
here
you
went
riding
one
night
on
borrowed
horses
said
frøkenen
laughingly
oh
we
know
all
about
it
never
fear
and
both
the
ladies
were
highly
amused
i
answered
on
a
sudden
thought
and
yet
your
father
would
have
me
to
take
service
with
him
or
it
so
while
i
think
of
it
frøken
how
did
your
father
know
i
was
working
for
captain
falkenberg
you
were
surprised
yourself
to
find
me
she
thought
quickly
and
glanced
at
fruen
and
said
i
wrote
home
and
told
fruen
cast
down
her
eyes
now
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
young
lady
was
inventing
but
she
put
in
excellent
answers
and
tied
my
tongue
it
sounded
all
so
natural
she
writes
an
ordinary
letter
to
her
people
at
home
and
puts
in
something
like
this
and
who
do
you
think
is
here
the
man
who
did
those
for
us
he
felling
timber
now
for
captain
falkenberg
but
when
we
reached
the
vicarage
the
new
hand
was
engaged
already
and
there
at
work
had
been
there
three
weeks
past
he
came
out
to
take
the
horses
after
that
i
thought
and
thought
again
why
had
they
chosen
me
to
drive
them
down
perhaps
it
was
meant
as
a
little
treat
for
me
as
against
falkenberg
being
asked
into
the
parlour
to
sing
but
surely
they
understand
these
people
that
i
was
a
man
who
had
nearly
finished
a
new
machine
and
would
soon
have
no
need
of
any
such
trifles
i
went
about
sharp
and
sullen
and
with
myself
had
my
meal
in
the
kitchen
where
oline
gave
me
her
blessing
for
the
and
went
out
to
tend
my
horses
i
took
my
rug
and
went
over
to
the
barn
in
the
dark
i
woke
to
find
some
one
touching
me
you
must
lie
here
you
know
it
simply
freezing
said
præstefruen
come
with
me
and
i
show
you
we
talked
of
that
a
little
i
was
not
inclined
to
move
and
at
last
she
sat
down
herself
instead
a
flame
she
was
nay
a
daughter
of
nature
within
her
the
music
of
a
rapturous
dance
was
playing
yet
xxiv
next
morning
i
was
more
content
with
things
i
had
cooled
down
and
turned
sensible
i
was
resigned
if
only
i
had
seen
before
what
was
best
for
me
i
might
have
taken
service
here
at
the
vicarage
and
been
the
first
of
all
equals
ay
and
settle
down
and
taken
root
in
a
quiet
countryish
life
fru
falkenberg
stood
out
in
the
courtyard
her
bright
figure
stood
like
a
pillar
stood
there
free
and
erect
in
the
open
courtyard
and
her
head
was
bare
i
greeted
her
godmorgen
she
answered
again
and
came
striding
towards
me
then
very
quietly
she
asked
i
wanted
to
see
how
they
put
you
up
last
night
only
i
could
get
away
that
is
of
course
i
got
away
but
you
were
in
the
barn
were
you
the
last
words
came
to
me
as
if
in
a
dream
and
i
did
not
answer
well
why
do
you
answer
yes
in
the
barn
were
you
and
was
it
quite
all
right
oh
well
then
yes
yes
we
shall
be
going
back
sometime
she
turned
and
walked
away
her
face
all
in
one
great
flush
harald
came
and
asked
me
to
make
a
kite
a
kite
i
answered
all
confusedly
ay
i
make
you
a
kite
a
huge
one
that
go
right
up
to
the
clouds
that
i
we
worked
at
it
for
a
couple
of
hours
harald
and
i
he
was
good
and
quick
and
so
innocent
in
his
eagerness
i
for
my
part
was
thinking
of
anything
but
kites
we
made
a
tail
several
metres
long
and
busied
ourselves
with
paste
and
lashing
and
binding
twice
frøken
elisabeth
came
out
to
look
on
she
may
have
been
every
bit
as
sweet
and
bright
as
before
but
i
cared
nothing
for
what
she
was
and
gave
no
thought
to
her
then
came
the
order
to
harness
ready
to
start
i
should
have
obeyed
the
order
at
once
for
we
had
a
long
drive
before
us
but
instead
i
sent
harald
in
to
ask
if
we
might
wait
just
half
an
hour
more
and
we
worked
on
till
the
kite
was
finished
next
day
when
the
paste
was
dry
harald
could
send
up
his
kite
and
watch
it
rise
and
feel
unknown
emotion
within
him
as
i
did
now
ready
to
start
fruen
comes
out
all
the
family
are
there
to
see
her
off
the
priest
and
his
wife
both
know
me
again
return
my
greeting
and
say
a
few
words
but
i
heard
nothing
said
of
my
taking
service
with
them
now
the
priest
knew
me
again
yes
and
his
wife
looked
at
me
with
that
sidelong
glance
of
hers
as
she
knew
me
again
for
all
she
had
known
me
the
night
before
as
well
frøken
elisabeth
brings
out
some
food
for
the
journey
and
wraps
her
friend
up
well
sure
you
be
warm
enough
now
she
asks
for
the
last
time
quite
sure
thanks
it
more
than
warm
enough
with
all
these
see
you
drive
as
nicely
as
you
did
yesterday
says
frøken
with
a
nod
to
me
as
well
and
we
drove
off
the
day
was
raw
and
chilly
and
i
saw
at
once
that
fruen
was
not
warm
enough
with
her
rug
we
drive
on
for
hour
after
hour
the
horses
know
they
are
on
the
way
home
and
trot
without
asking
my
bare
hands
stiffen
about
the
reins
as
we
neared
a
cottage
a
little
way
from
the
road
fruen
knocked
on
the
carriage
window
to
say
it
was
she
gets
out
and
her
face
was
pale
with
the
cold
we
go
up
there
and
have
dinner
she
says
come
up
as
soon
as
you
ready
and
bring
the
and
she
walked
up
the
hill
it
must
be
because
of
the
cold
she
chose
to
eat
in
a
stranger
house
i
thought
to
myself
she
could
hardly
be
afraid
of
me
i
tied
up
the
horses
and
gave
them
their
fodder
it
looked
like
rain
so
i
put
the
oilskins
over
them
patted
them
and
went
up
to
the
cottage
with
the
basket
there
is
only
an
old
woman
at
home
værsaagod
she
says
and
come
and
she
goes
on
tending
her
fruen
unpacks
the
basket
and
says
without
looking
at
me
i
suppose
i
am
to
help
you
again
thank
you
if
you
we
ate
in
silence
i
sitting
on
a
little
bench
by
the
door
with
my
plate
on
the
seat
beside
me
fruen
at
the
table
looking
out
of
the
window
all
the
time
and
hardly
eating
anything
at
all
now
and
again
she
exchanges
a
word
with
the
old
woman
or
glances
at
my
plate
to
see
if
it
is
empty
the
little
place
is
cramped
enough
with
but
two
steps
from
the
window
to
where
i
sit
so
we
are
all
sitting
together
after
all
when
the
coffee
is
ready
i
have
no
room
for
my
cup
on
the
end
of
the
bench
but
sit
holding
it
in
my
hand
then
fruen
turns
towards
me
calmly
and
says
with
eyes
there
is
room
i
can
hear
my
own
heart
beating
and
i
murmur
something
thanks
it
quite
all
right
i
rather
no
doubt
but
that
she
is
uneasy
she
is
afraid
lest
i
should
say
something
she
sits
once
more
looking
away
but
i
can
see
she
is
breathing
heavily
ah
she
need
have
no
fear
i
would
not
trouble
her
with
so
much
as
a
word
now
i
had
to
take
the
empty
plate
and
cup
and
set
them
back
on
the
table
but
i
feared
to
startle
her
in
my
approach
for
she
was
still
sitting
with
averted
head
i
made
a
little
noise
with
the
things
to
draw
her
attention
set
them
down
and
thanked
her
she
tried
to
put
on
a
housewifely
tone
wo
you
have
some
more
i
sure
you
ca
have
no
thank
you
very
much
shall
i
pack
up
the
things
now
but
i
doubt
if
i
i
happened
to
glance
at
my
hands
they
had
swelled
up
terribly
in
the
warm
room
and
were
all
shapeless
and
heavy
now
i
could
hardly
pack
up
things
with
hands
like
that
she
guessed
my
thought
looked
first
at
my
hands
then
out
across
the
room
and
said
with
a
little
smile
have
you
no
gloves
no
i
never
wear
i
went
back
to
my
place
waited
till
she
should
have
packed
up
the
things
so
i
could
carry
the
basket
down
suddenly
she
turned
her
head
towards
me
still
without
looking
up
and
asked
again
where
do
you
come
from
from
pause
i
ventured
to
ask
in
my
turn
if
fruen
had
ever
been
there
yes
when
i
was
a
then
she
looked
at
her
watch
as
if
to
check
me
from
any
more
questions
and
at
the
same
time
to
hint
it
was
getting
late
i
rose
at
once
and
went
out
to
the
horses
it
was
already
growing
dusk
the
sky
was
darker
and
a
loose
wet
sleet
was
beginning
to
fall
i
took
my
rug
down
covertly
from
the
box
and
hid
it
under
the
front
seat
inside
the
carriage
when
that
was
done
i
watered
the
horses
and
harnessed
up
a
little
after
fruen
came
down
the
hill
i
went
up
for
the
basket
and
met
her
on
the
way
where
are
you
going
to
fetch
the
you
need
trouble
thanks
there
nothing
to
take
we
went
down
to
the
carriage
she
got
in
and
i
made
to
help
her
to
rights
with
the
rug
she
had
then
i
pulled
out
my
own
from
under
the
front
seat
taking
care
to
keep
the
border
out
of
sight
lest
she
should
recognize
it
oh
what
a
blessing
cried
fruen
why
where
was
it
under
the
seat
well
of
course
i
might
have
borrowed
some
more
rugs
from
the
vicarage
but
the
poor
souls
would
never
have
got
them
back
again
thanks
i
can
manage
no
thank
you
i
can
manage
by
myself
you
can
drive
on
i
closed
the
carriage
door
and
climbed
to
my
seat
now
if
she
knocks
at
the
window
again
it
that
rug
i
thought
to
myself
well
i
wo
stop
hour
after
hour
passed
it
was
pitch
dark
now
raining
and
snowing
harder
than
ever
and
the
road
growing
worse
all
the
time
now
and
again
i
would
jump
down
from
the
box
and
run
along
beside
the
horses
to
keep
warm
the
water
was
pouring
from
my
clothes
we
were
nearing
home
now
i
was
hoping
there
would
not
be
too
much
light
when
we
drove
up
so
that
she
recognized
the
rug
unfortunately
there
were
lights
in
all
the
windows
waiting
her
arrival
in
desperation
i
checked
the
horses
a
little
before
we
got
to
the
steps
and
got
down
to
open
the
carriage
door
but
why
what
on
earth
have
you
pulled
up
here
for
i
only
thought
if
perhaps
fruen
would
mind
getting
out
here
all
mud
on
ahead
the
wheels
she
must
have
thought
i
was
trying
to
entice
her
into
something
heaven
knows
drive
on
man
do
she
said
the
horses
moved
on
and
the
carriage
stopped
just
where
the
light
was
at
its
full
emma
came
out
to
receive
her
mistress
fruen
handed
her
the
rugs
all
in
a
bundle
as
she
had
rolled
them
up
before
getting
out
of
the
carriage
thanks
she
said
to
me
glancing
round
as
she
went
in
heavens
how
dreadfully
wet
you
are
xxv
a
curious
piece
of
news
awaited
me
falkenberg
had
taken
service
with
the
captain
as
a
this
upset
the
plan
we
had
agreed
on
and
left
me
alone
once
more
i
could
not
understand
a
word
of
it
all
anyhow
i
could
think
it
over
tomorrow
by
two
in
the
morning
i
was
still
lying
awake
shivering
and
thinking
all
those
hours
i
could
not
get
warm
then
at
last
it
turned
hot
and
i
lay
there
in
full
fever
how
frightened
she
had
been
yesterday
dared
not
sit
down
to
eat
with
me
by
the
roadside
and
never
opened
her
eyes
to
me
once
through
all
the
journey
coming
to
my
senses
for
a
moment
it
occurs
to
me
i
might
wake
falkenberg
with
my
tossing
about
and
perhaps
say
things
in
my
delirium
that
would
never
do
i
clench
my
teeth
and
jump
up
get
into
my
clothes
again
scramble
down
the
stairs
and
set
out
over
the
fields
at
a
run
after
a
little
my
clothes
begin
to
warm
me
i
make
towards
the
woods
towards
the
spot
where
we
had
been
working
sweat
and
rain
pour
down
my
face
if
only
i
can
find
the
saw
and
work
the
fever
out
of
my
body
is
an
old
and
tried
cure
of
mine
that
the
saw
is
nowhere
to
be
seen
but
i
come
upon
the
ax
i
had
left
there
saturday
evening
and
set
to
work
with
that
it
is
almost
too
dark
to
see
at
all
but
i
feel
at
the
cut
now
and
then
with
my
hands
and
bring
down
several
trees
the
sweat
pours
off
me
now
then
feeling
exhausted
enough
i
hide
the
ax
in
its
old
place
it
is
getting
light
now
and
i
set
off
at
a
run
for
home
where
have
you
been
asks
falkenberg
now
i
do
not
want
him
to
know
about
my
having
taken
cold
the
day
before
and
perhaps
go
making
talk
of
it
in
the
kitchen
i
simply
mutter
something
about
not
knowing
quite
where
i
have
been
you
been
up
to
see
rønnaug
i
bet
he
said
i
answered
yes
i
had
been
with
rønnaug
since
he
guessed
it
was
none
so
hard
to
guess
he
said
anyhow
you
wo
see
me
running
after
any
of
them
going
to
have
emma
then
why
it
looks
that
way
it
a
pity
you
ca
get
taken
on
here
too
then
you
might
get
one
of
the
others
and
he
went
on
talking
of
how
i
might
perhaps
have
got
my
pick
of
the
other
girls
but
the
captain
had
no
use
for
me
i
was
even
to
go
out
tomorrow
to
the
wood
the
words
sound
far
away
reaching
me
across
a
sea
of
sleep
that
is
rolling
towards
me
next
morning
the
fever
is
gone
i
am
still
a
little
weak
but
make
ready
to
go
out
to
the
wood
all
the
same
you
wo
need
to
put
on
your
woodcutting
things
again
says
falkenberg
i
told
you
that
true
nevertheless
i
put
on
those
things
seeing
the
others
are
wet
falkenberg
is
a
little
awkward
with
me
now
because
of
breaking
our
plan
by
way
of
excuse
he
says
he
thought
i
was
taking
work
at
the
vicarage
so
you
not
coming
up
to
the
hills
then
i
asked
h
no
i
do
think
so
no
and
you
know
yourself
i
sick
of
tramping
around
i
not
get
a
better
chance
than
i
make
as
if
it
was
no
great
matter
to
me
and
take
up
a
sudden
interest
in
petter
worst
of
all
for
him
poor
fellow
to
be
turned
out
and
nowhere
to
go
nowhere
to
go
echoes
falkenberg
when
he
lain
here
the
three
weeks
he
allowed
to
stay
sick
by
law
he
go
back
home
again
his
a
then
falkenberg
declares
it
like
losing
part
of
himself
to
have
me
go
if
it
was
for
emma
he
break
his
word
to
the
captain
after
all
here
he
says
i
give
you
what
that
it
the
certificates
i
sha
want
them
now
but
they
may
be
the
saving
of
you
at
a
pinch
if
you
ever
wanted
to
tune
a
piano
and
he
hands
me
the
papers
and
the
key
but
seeing
i
have
his
ear
for
music
the
things
are
no
use
to
me
and
i
tell
him
so
i
could
better
handle
a
grindstone
than
a
piano
whereat
falkenberg
burst
out
laughing
relieved
to
find
me
ready
with
a
jest
to
the
last
falkenberg
goes
out
i
have
time
to
laze
a
little
and
lie
down
all
dressed
on
the
bed
resting
and
thinking
well
our
work
was
at
an
end
we
should
have
had
to
go
anyhow
i
could
not
reckon
on
staying
here
for
all
eternity
the
only
thing
outside
all
calculation
was
that
falkenberg
should
stay
if
only
it
had
been
me
they
offered
his
work
i
have
worked
enough
for
two
now
was
there
any
chance
of
buying
him
off
i
wondered
to
tell
the
truth
i
fancied
i
had
noticed
something
before
as
if
the
captain
were
not
altogether
pleased
to
have
this
labourer
about
the
place
bearing
his
own
name
well
perhaps
i
had
been
wrong
i
thought
and
thought
after
all
i
had
been
a
good
workman
as
far
as
i
knew
and
i
had
never
stolen
a
moment
of
the
captain
time
for
work
on
my
own
invention
i
fell
asleep
again
and
wakened
at
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
before
i
had
time
to
get
properly
to
my
feet
there
was
the
captain
himself
in
the
doorway
do
get
up
he
said
kindly
and
turned
as
if
to
go
again
still
seeing
you
awake
we
might
settle
up
what
do
you
say
i
said
it
was
as
he
pleased
and
many
thanks
i
ought
to
tell
you
though
both
your
friend
and
i
thought
you
were
going
to
take
service
at
the
vicarage
and
so
and
now
the
broken
up
there
no
doing
more
among
the
timber
and
besides
got
down
all
there
was
to
come
well
now
i
settled
with
the
other
man
i
do
know
if
you
i
said
i
would
be
quite
content
with
the
same
h
your
friend
and
i
agreed
you
ought
to
have
more
per
falkenberg
had
said
no
word
of
this
to
me
it
sounded
like
the
own
idea
i
agreed
with
him
we
should
share
alike
said
i
but
you
were
sort
of
foreman
of
course
you
ought
to
have
fifty
øre
per
day
i
saw
my
hesitation
displeased
him
and
let
him
reckon
it
out
as
he
pleased
when
he
gave
me
the
money
i
said
it
was
more
than
i
had
reckoned
with
the
captain
answered
very
pleased
to
hear
it
and
i
written
a
few
lines
here
that
might
be
useful
saying
you
worked
well
the
time
you
were
he
handed
me
the
paper
a
just
and
kindly
man
the
captain
he
said
nothing
now
about
the
idea
of
laying
on
water
to
the
house
next
spring
i
took
it
he
his
reasons
for
that
and
did
not
like
to
trouble
him
then
he
asked
so
you
going
off
now
to
work
on
the
railway
i
said
i
was
not
quite
sure
as
to
that
well
well
anyhow
thanks
for
the
time
you
been
with
he
moved
towards
the
door
and
i
miserable
weakling
that
i
was
could
not
hold
myself
in
check
but
asked
you
wo
be
having
any
work
for
me
later
on
perhaps
in
the
spring
i
do
know
we
shall
see
i
well
it
all
depends
if
you
should
happen
to
be
anywhere
near
why
what
about
that
machine
of
yours
i
ventured
to
ask
if
i
might
leave
it
on
the
place
certainly
said
the
captain
when
he
had
gone
i
sat
down
on
the
bed
well
it
was
all
over
now
ay
so
it
was
and
lord
have
mercy
on
us
all
nine
she
is
up
she
is
there
in
the
house
i
can
see
from
this
very
window
well
let
me
get
away
and
have
done
with
it
i
get
out
my
sack
and
stow
away
my
things
put
on
my
wet
jacket
over
my
blouse
and
am
ready
to
start
but
i
sit
down
again
emma
comes
in
there
something
ready
for
you
in
the
to
my
horror
she
had
my
rug
over
one
arm
and
fruen
told
me
to
ask
if
this
was
your
mine
no
i
got
mine
here
with
my
emma
goes
off
again
with
the
rug
well
how
could
i
say
it
was
mine
devil
take
the
rug
should
i
go
down
to
the
kitchen
or
not
i
might
be
able
to
say
and
thanks
at
the
same
time
nothing
strange
in
that
emma
came
in
again
with
the
rug
and
laid
it
down
neatly
folded
on
a
stool
if
you
do
hurry
up
the
coffee
be
cold
she
says
what
did
you
put
that
rug
there
for
fruen
told
me
oh
well
perhaps
it
falkenberg
i
muttered
emma
asks
are
you
going
away
now
for
good
yes
seeing
you
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
you
says
emma
with
a
toss
of
her
head
i
went
down
with
emma
to
the
kitchen
sitting
at
table
i
saw
the
captain
going
out
to
the
woods
good
he
was
gone
now
perhaps
fruen
might
come
out
i
finished
my
meal
and
got
up
should
i
go
off
now
and
leave
it
at
that
of
course
what
else
i
took
leave
of
the
maids
with
a
jesting
word
to
each
in
turn
i
have
liked
to
say
to
fruen
too
but
fruen
indoors
i
emma
goes
in
and
comes
back
a
moment
later
fruen
lying
down
with
a
headache
she
sent
her
very
good
come
again
said
all
the
girls
as
i
set
off
i
walked
away
out
of
the
place
with
my
sack
under
my
arm
then
suddenly
i
remembered
the
ax
falkenberg
might
not
find
it
where
i
put
it
i
went
back
knocked
at
the
kitchen
door
and
left
a
message
for
him
where
it
was
going
down
the
road
i
turned
once
or
twice
and
looked
back
towards
the
windows
of
the
house
then
all
was
out
of
sight
xxvi
i
circled
round
all
that
day
keeping
near
to
øvrebø
looked
in
at
one
or
two
farms
to
ask
for
work
and
wandered
on
again
like
an
outcast
aimlessly
it
was
a
chill
unkindly
day
and
i
had
need
of
all
my
walking
to
keep
warm
towards
evening
i
made
over
to
my
old
working
place
among
the
timber
i
heard
no
sound
of
the
ax
falkenberg
had
gone
home
i
found
the
trees
i
had
felled
the
night
before
and
laughed
outright
at
the
ghastly
looking
stumps
i
had
left
falkenberg
would
surely
have
seen
the
havoc
and
wondered
who
could
have
done
it
possibly
he
might
have
set
it
down
to
witchcraft
and
fled
home
accordingly
before
it
got
dark
falkenberg
hahaha
but
it
was
no
healthy
merriment
i
doubt
a
thing
born
of
the
fever
and
the
weakness
that
followed
it
and
i
soon
turned
sorrowful
once
more
here
on
this
spot
she
had
stood
one
day
with
that
girl
friend
of
hers
they
had
come
out
and
talked
to
us
in
the
woods
when
it
was
dark
enough
i
started
down
towards
the
house
perhaps
i
might
sleep
in
the
loft
again
then
when
her
headache
was
gone
she
might
come
out
i
went
down
near
enough
to
see
the
lights
of
the
house
then
i
turned
back
no
perhaps
it
was
too
early
yet
then
for
a
time
i
should
reckon
about
two
hours
i
wandered
round
and
sat
down
a
bit
wandered
again
and
sat
down
a
bit
then
i
moved
up
towards
the
house
again
now
i
could
perfectly
well
go
up
in
the
loft
and
lie
down
there
as
for
falkenberg
miserable
worm
let
him
dare
to
say
a
word
now
i
know
what
i
will
do
i
will
hide
my
sack
in
the
woods
before
i
go
up
so
as
to
look
as
if
i
had
only
come
back
for
some
little
thing
i
had
forgotten
and
i
go
back
to
the
woods
no
sooner
have
i
hidden
the
sack
than
i
realize
i
am
not
concerned
at
all
with
falkenberg
and
sleeping
in
the
loft
i
am
a
fool
and
a
madman
for
the
thing
i
want
is
not
shelter
for
the
night
but
a
sight
of
just
one
creature
there
before
i
leave
the
place
and
i
say
to
myself
my
good
sir
was
it
not
you
that
set
out
to
live
a
quiet
life
among
healthy
folk
to
win
back
your
peace
of
mind
i
pull
out
my
sack
from
its
fling
it
over
my
shoulder
and
move
towards
the
house
for
the
third
time
keeping
well
away
from
the
servants
quarters
and
coming
round
on
the
south
side
of
the
main
building
there
is
a
light
in
the
parlour
and
now
although
it
is
dark
i
let
down
the
sack
from
over
my
shoulder
not
to
look
like
a
beggar
and
thrust
it
under
my
arm
as
if
it
were
a
parcel
so
i
steal
up
cautiously
towards
the
house
when
i
have
got
near
enough
i
stop
stand
there
upright
and
strong
before
the
windows
take
off
my
cap
and
stand
there
still
there
is
no
one
to
be
seen
within
not
a
shadow
the
is
all
dark
they
have
finished
their
evening
meal
it
must
be
late
i
tell
myself
suddenly
the
lamp
in
the
parlour
goes
out
and
the
whole
house
seems
dead
and
deserted
i
wait
a
little
then
a
solitary
light
shines
out
upstairs
that
must
be
her
room
the
light
burns
for
half
an
hour
perhaps
and
then
goes
out
again
she
had
gone
to
rest
for
ever
and
of
course
i
shall
not
come
back
to
this
place
in
the
spring
a
ridiculous
idea
when
i
got
down
on
to
the
high
road
i
shouldered
my
sack
once
more
and
set
out
on
my
travels
in
the
morning
i
go
on
again
having
slept
in
a
barn
where
it
was
terribly
cold
having
nothing
to
wrap
round
me
moreover
i
had
to
start
out
again
just
at
the
coldest
hour
about
daybreak
lest
i
should
be
found
there
i
walk
on
and
on
the
woods
change
from
pine
to
birch
and
back
again
coming
upon
a
patch
of
fine
juniper
i
cut
myself
a
staff
and
sit
down
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
to
trim
it
here
and
there
among
the
trees
a
yellow
leaf
or
so
still
hangs
but
the
birches
are
full
of
catkins
set
with
pearly
drops
now
and
again
half
a
dozen
small
birds
swoop
down
on
one
of
these
birches
to
peck
at
the
catkins
and
then
look
about
for
a
stone
or
a
rough
tree
trunk
to
rub
the
gum
from
their
beaks
each
is
jealous
of
the
rest
they
watch
and
chase
and
drive
one
another
away
though
there
are
millions
of
catkins
for
them
to
take
all
they
will
and
the
one
that
is
chased
never
does
anything
but
take
to
flight
if
a
little
bird
comes
bearing
down
towards
a
bigger
one
the
bigger
one
will
move
away
even
a
thrush
offers
no
resistance
to
a
sparrow
but
simply
takes
itself
off
i
fancy
it
must
be
the
speed
of
the
attack
that
does
it
the
cold
and
discomfort
of
the
morning
gradually
disappear
it
amuses
me
to
watch
the
various
things
i
meet
with
on
my
way
and
think
a
little
idly
enough
of
every
one
the
birds
were
most
diverting
also
it
was
cheering
to
reflect
that
i
had
my
pocket
full
of
money
falkenberg
had
chanced
to
mention
that
morning
where
petter
home
was
and
i
now
made
for
that
there
would
hardly
be
work
for
me
on
so
small
a
place
but
now
that
i
was
rich
it
was
not
work
i
sought
for
first
of
all
petter
would
be
coming
home
soon
no
doubt
and
perhaps
have
some
news
to
tell
i
managed
so
as
to
reach
the
farm
in
the
evening
i
said
i
brought
news
of
their
son
that
he
was
much
better
now
and
would
soon
be
home
again
and
could
they
put
me
up
for
the
night
xxvii
i
have
been
staying
here
a
couple
of
days
petter
has
come
home
but
had
nothing
to
tell
is
all
well
at
øvrebø
ay
there
nothing
wrong
that
i
know
did
you
see
them
all
before
you
left
the
captain
fruen
nobody
ill
no
why
who
should
there
be
well
falkenberg
said
something
about
he
hurt
his
hand
but
i
suppose
it
all
right
now
there
was
little
comfort
in
this
home
though
they
seemed
to
be
quite
well
off
petter
father
was
deputy
to
the
storting
and
had
taken
to
sitting
reading
the
papers
of
an
evening
eh
reading
and
reading
the
whole
house
suffered
under
it
and
the
daughters
were
bored
to
death
when
petter
came
home
the
entire
family
set
to
work
reckoning
out
whether
he
had
gotten
his
full
pay
and
if
he
had
lain
sick
at
øvrebø
for
the
full
time
allowed
him
by
law
or
provided
by
statute
as
his
father
the
deputy
put
it
yesterday
when
i
happened
to
break
a
window
a
little
pane
that
cost
next
to
nothing
there
was
no
end
of
whispering
about
it
and
unfriendly
glances
at
me
from
all
sides
so
today
i
went
up
to
the
store
and
bought
a
new
pane
and
fixed
it
in
properly
with
putty
then
said
the
deputy
you
need
have
taken
all
that
trouble
over
a
pane
of
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
not
only
for
that
i
had
been
up
to
the
store
i
also
bought
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
to
show
i
did
not
care
so
much
for
the
price
of
a
pane
of
glass
or
so
also
i
bought
a
to
give
the
girls
when
i
went
away
we
could
drink
the
wine
this
evening
tomorrow
would
be
sunday
and
we
should
all
have
time
to
lie
abed
but
on
monday
morning
i
would
start
off
again
things
turned
out
otherwise
however
the
two
girls
had
been
up
in
the
loft
sniffing
at
my
sack
both
the
wine
and
the
had
put
fancies
into
their
heads
they
imagined
all
sorts
of
things
and
began
throwing
out
hints
wait
a
bit
thought
i
to
myself
my
time
will
come
in
the
evening
i
sit
with
the
family
in
the
parlour
talking
we
have
just
finished
supper
and
the
master
of
the
house
had
put
on
his
spectacles
to
read
the
papers
then
some
one
coughs
outside
some
one
coming
in
i
say
the
girls
exchange
glances
and
go
out
a
little
after
they
open
the
door
and
show
in
two
young
men
come
in
and
sit
down
says
the
wife
it
struck
me
just
then
that
these
two
peasant
lads
had
been
invited
on
the
strength
of
my
wine
and
that
they
were
sweethearts
with
the
girls
smart
young
creatures
eighteen
nineteen
years
old
and
already
up
to
anything
well
if
they
reckoned
on
that
wine
now
they
be
mistaken
not
a
drop
there
was
some
talking
of
the
weather
how
it
was
no
better
than
could
be
looked
for
that
time
of
year
but
a
pity
the
wet
had
stopped
the
ploughing
there
was
no
sort
of
life
in
this
talk
and
one
of
the
girls
turned
to
me
and
said
i
was
very
quiet
this
evening
how
could
it
be
maybe
because
i
going
away
i
answered
i
a
good
long
way
to
go
between
now
and
monday
then
perhaps
we
ought
to
have
a
parting
glass
tonight
there
was
some
giggling
at
this
as
a
thrust
at
me
for
keeping
back
the
wine
that
miserly
fashion
but
i
did
not
know
these
girls
and
cared
nothing
for
them
otherwise
i
had
acted
differently
what
do
you
mean
i
asked
i
bought
three
bottles
of
wine
that
to
take
with
me
to
a
certain
and
you
going
to
carry
it
all
that
way
asked
the
girl
amid
much
laughter
as
if
there
were
never
a
store
on
the
frøkenen
forgets
that
it
sunday
tomorrow
and
the
stores
on
the
road
will
be
shut
said
i
the
laugh
died
away
but
i
could
see
the
company
was
no
more
kindly
disposed
towards
me
now
for
speaking
straight
out
i
turned
to
the
wife
and
asked
coldly
how
much
i
owed
her
for
the
time
i
had
stayed
but
surely
there
was
no
hurry
would
it
do
tomorrow
i
was
in
a
hurry
thank
you
i
had
been
there
two
days
what
did
that
come
to
she
thought
over
it
quite
a
while
at
last
she
went
out
and
got
her
husband
to
go
with
her
and
work
it
out
together
seeing
they
stayed
so
long
away
i
went
up
to
the
loft
packed
my
sack
all
ready
and
carried
it
down
into
the
passage
i
proposed
to
be
even
more
offended
and
start
off
now
that
very
night
it
would
be
a
good
way
of
taking
leave
as
things
were
when
i
came
into
the
room
again
petter
said
you
do
mean
to
say
you
starting
out
tonight
yes
i
you
no
call
to
heed
the
girls
nonsense
let
the
old
fellow
go
if
he
wants
to
said
his
sister
at
last
the
deputy
and
his
wife
came
in
again
stiffly
and
stubbornly
silent
well
and
how
much
did
i
owe
them
h
they
would
leave
it
to
me
they
were
all
alike
a
mean
and
crafty
lot
i
felt
myself
stifling
and
picking
out
the
first
note
that
came
to
hand
i
flung
it
at
the
woman
was
that
enough
h
a
tidy
bit
for
sure
but
still
and
some
might
say
was
enough
but
how
much
was
it
i
had
given
her
a
note
well
perhaps
it
was
barely
enough
i
felt
in
my
pocket
for
some
more
no
mother
it
was
a
said
petter
and
that
too
much
you
have
to
give
him
something
the
old
woman
opens
her
hand
looks
at
the
note
and
turns
so
very
surprised
all
at
once
why
so
it
is
ten
kroner
yes
i
did
properly
look
why
then
right
enough
and
many
thanks
her
husband
in
embarrassment
starts
talking
to
the
two
lads
of
what
he
been
reading
in
the
paper
nasty
accident
hand
crushed
in
a
the
girls
pretended
not
to
notice
me
but
sat
like
two
cats
all
the
time
with
necks
drawn
in
and
eyes
as
thin
as
knife
blades
nothing
to
stay
for
here
to
them
all
the
old
woman
comes
out
in
the
passage
and
tries
making
up
to
me
if
only
you
lend
us
just
one
of
those
bottles
now
she
says
be
a
real
kindness
that
it
would
with
the
two
lads
sitting
there
and
said
i
shortly
and
would
hear
no
more
i
had
my
sack
over
my
shoulder
and
the
in
one
hand
it
was
a
heavy
load
and
the
muddy
road
made
things
no
easier
but
for
all
that
i
walked
with
a
light
heart
it
was
a
miserable
business
altogether
and
i
might
as
well
admit
i
had
acted
a
trifle
meanly
meanly
not
a
bit
i
formed
myself
into
a
little
committee
and
pointed
out
that
those
infernal
girls
had
planned
to
entertain
their
sweethearts
with
my
wine
well
and
good
but
was
not
my
towards
that
idea
male
selfishness
on
my
part
if
two
strange
girls
had
been
invited
instead
of
two
young
men
should
i
not
have
uncorked
the
wine
without
a
murmur
certainly
and
then
as
to
their
calling
me
an
old
fellow
after
all
it
was
perfectly
right
old
indeed
i
must
be
since
i
took
offence
at
being
set
aside
in
favour
of
stray
but
my
sense
of
injury
cooled
down
in
the
course
of
that
hard
walking
the
committee
meeting
was
adjourned
and
i
toiled
along
hour
after
hour
with
my
ridiculous
burden
three
bottles
of
wine
and
a
it
was
mild
and
slightly
foggy
i
could
not
see
the
lights
of
a
farm
till
quite
close
up
and
then
mostly
the
dogs
would
come
dashing
out
on
me
and
hinder
me
from
stealing
into
a
barn
later
and
later
it
grew
i
was
tired
and
discouraged
and
plagued
myself
too
with
anxiety
about
the
future
had
i
not
already
wasted
a
heap
of
money
on
the
most
useless
trash
i
must
sell
that
again
now
and
get
some
of
it
back
at
long
last
i
came
to
a
place
where
there
was
no
dog
there
was
still
a
light
in
the
window
and
without
more
ado
i
walked
up
and
asked
shelter
for
the
night
xxviii
a
young
girl
sat
at
a
table
sewing
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
when
i
asked
for
shelter
she
answered
brightly
and
trustingly
that
she
would
see
and
went
into
a
little
room
at
the
side
i
called
after
her
as
she
went
that
i
would
be
glad
only
to
sit
here
by
the
stove
till
daylight
a
little
after
the
girl
came
in
again
with
her
mother
who
was
still
buttoning
her
clothes
about
her
shelter
for
the
night
well
well
there
was
that
room
in
the
place
they
could
make
me
properly
comfortable
but
i
be
welcome
to
the
bedroom
such
as
it
was
and
where
would
they
sleep
themselves
why
it
was
near
day
now
and
the
girl
be
sitting
up
anyhow
for
a
bit
with
her
sewing
what
was
she
sewing
to
sit
up
for
all
night
a
new
dress
no
only
the
skirt
she
was
to
wear
it
to
church
in
the
morning
but
would
hear
of
her
mother
helping
i
brought
up
my
and
said
jestingly
that
a
skirt
more
or
less
was
a
mere
trifle
for
a
thing
like
this
wait
and
i
show
them
was
i
a
tailor
then
no
but
i
sold
i
took
out
the
printed
directions
and
studied
them
to
see
how
it
worked
the
girl
listened
attentively
she
was
a
mere
child
her
thin
fingers
were
all
blue
with
the
dye
from
the
stuff
there
was
something
so
about
those
blue
fingers
i
brought
out
some
wine
and
poured
out
for
all
of
us
then
we
go
on
sewing
again
i
with
the
printed
paper
and
the
girl
working
the
machine
she
is
delighted
to
see
how
easily
it
goes
and
her
eyes
are
all
aglow
how
old
was
she
sixteen
confirmed
last
year
and
what
was
her
name
olga
her
mother
stands
watching
us
and
would
dearly
like
to
try
the
machine
herself
but
every
time
she
comes
near
olga
says
be
careful
mother
you
despise
and
when
the
spool
needs
filling
and
her
mother
takes
the
shuttle
in
her
hand
a
moment
the
child
is
once
more
afraid
it
may
be
footnote
foragte
literally
the
word
is
evidently
to
be
understood
as
used
in
error
by
the
girl
herself
in
place
of
some
equivalent
of
spoil
destroy
the
author
purpose
being
to
convey
an
impression
of
something
touchingly
poor
as
with
the
fingers
earlier
and
her
awkward
gait
and
figure
later
mentioned
precisely
similar
characteristics
are
used
to
the
same
end
in
and
elsewhere
the
old
woman
puts
on
the
and
tends
the
fire
the
room
is
soon
warm
and
cosy
the
lonely
folk
are
as
trusting
and
kindly
as
could
be
olga
laughs
when
i
make
a
little
jest
about
the
machine
i
noted
that
neither
of
them
asked
how
much
the
thing
cost
though
i
had
told
them
it
was
for
sale
they
looked
on
it
as
hopelessly
beyond
their
reach
but
they
could
still
take
a
delight
in
seeing
it
work
i
hinted
that
olga
really
ought
to
have
a
machine
like
that
seeing
she
got
the
way
of
it
so
neatly
all
at
once
her
mother
answered
it
would
have
to
wait
till
she
been
out
in
service
for
a
bit
was
she
going
out
in
service
why
yes
she
hoped
so
anyway
both
her
other
daughters
were
in
service
and
doing
well
thank
god
olga
would
be
meeting
them
at
church
in
the
morning
there
was
a
little
cracked
mirror
hanging
on
one
of
the
walls
on
the
other
a
few
cheap
prints
had
been
tacked
up
pictures
of
soldiers
on
horseback
and
royalties
with
a
great
deal
of
finery
one
of
these
pictures
is
old
and
frayed
it
is
a
portrait
of
the
empress
eugenie
and
evidently
not
a
recent
purchase
i
asked
where
it
had
come
from
the
good
woman
did
not
know
must
be
something
her
husband
had
bought
in
his
time
did
he
buy
it
here
more
likely
have
been
at
hersæt
where
he
had
been
in
service
as
a
young
man
might
be
thirty
years
gone
now
i
have
a
little
plan
in
my
head
already
and
say
that
picture
is
worth
a
deal
of
the
woman
thinks
i
am
making
game
of
her
so
i
make
a
close
inspection
of
the
picture
and
declare
emphatically
that
it
is
no
cheap
print
no
but
the
woman
is
quite
stupid
and
simply
says
well
did
i
think
so
now
the
thing
had
hung
there
ever
since
the
house
was
built
it
was
olga
by
the
way
she
had
called
it
hers
from
the
time
she
was
a
little
one
i
put
on
a
knowing
mysterious
air
and
ask
for
further
details
of
the
case
where
hersæt
might
be
hersæt
was
in
the
neighbouring
parish
some
eight
miles
away
the
lensmand
lived
there
the
coffee
is
ready
and
olga
and
i
call
a
halt
there
are
only
the
fastenings
to
be
done
now
i
ask
to
see
the
blouse
she
is
to
wear
with
the
skirt
and
it
appears
that
this
is
not
a
real
blouse
at
all
but
a
knitted
kerchief
but
she
has
a
jacket
that
one
of
her
sisters
gave
her
and
that
will
go
outside
and
hide
all
the
rest
olga
is
growing
so
fast
i
am
told
that
there
no
sense
in
buying
a
blouse
for
her
this
twelvemonth
to
come
olga
sits
sewing
on
hooks
and
eyes
and
that
is
soon
done
then
she
turns
so
sleepy
it
a
sight
to
see
wherefore
i
put
on
an
air
of
authority
and
order
her
to
bed
her
mother
feels
constrained
to
sit
up
and
keep
me
company
though
i
tell
her
myself
to
go
back
to
bed
again
you
ought
to
be
properly
thankful
i
sure
says
the
mother
to
the
strange
man
for
all
the
way
he
helped
and
olga
comes
up
to
me
and
gives
her
hand
to
thank
me
and
i
turn
her
round
and
shuffle
her
across
to
the
bedroom
door
you
better
go
too
i
say
to
her
mother
i
wo
sit
talking
any
more
for
i
tired
and
seeing
i
settle
down
by
the
stove
with
my
sack
under
my
head
she
shakes
her
head
with
a
smile
and
goes
off
too
xxix
i
am
happy
and
comfortable
here
it
is
morning
the
sun
coming
in
through
the
window
and
both
olga
and
her
mother
with
their
hair
so
smooth
and
plastered
down
a
wonder
to
see
after
breakfast
which
i
share
with
the
two
of
them
getting
quantities
of
coffee
with
it
olga
gets
herself
up
in
her
new
skirt
and
her
knitted
kerchief
and
the
jacket
eh
that
wonderful
jacket
lasting
at
the
edge
all
round
and
two
rows
of
buttons
of
the
same
and
the
neck
and
sleeves
trimmed
with
braid
but
little
olga
could
not
fill
it
out
nothing
near
it
the
child
is
all
odd
corners
and
angles
like
a
young
calf
could
we
just
take
it
in
a
bit
at
the
sides
i
ask
there
plenty
of
but
mother
and
daughter
exchange
glances
plainly
saying
is
sunday
and
no
using
needle
or
knife
that
day
i
understand
them
well
enough
for
i
would
have
thought
exactly
the
same
myself
in
my
childhood
so
i
try
to
find
a
way
out
by
a
little
is
another
matter
when
it
a
machine
that
does
the
work
no
more
than
when
an
innocent
cart
comes
rumbling
down
the
road
as
it
may
any
sunday
but
no
this
is
beyond
them
and
anyhow
the
jacket
must
give
her
room
to
grow
in
a
couple
of
years
it
would
fit
her
nicely
i
thought
about
for
something
i
could
slip
into
olga
hand
as
she
went
but
i
nothing
so
i
gave
her
a
silver
krone
and
straightway
she
gives
her
hand
in
thanks
and
shows
the
coin
to
her
mother
and
whispers
she
will
give
it
to
her
sister
at
church
her
eyes
are
simply
glowing
with
joy
at
the
thought
and
her
mother
hardly
less
moved
herself

yes
perhaps
she
ought
olga
goes
off
to
church
in
her
long
jacket
goes
shambling
down
the
hill
with
her
feet
turning
in
and
out
any
odd
way
a
sweet
and
heartening
thing
to
see
hersæt
now
was
that
a
big
place
yes
a
fine
big
place
i
sit
for
a
while
blinking
sleepy
eyes
and
making
excursions
in
etymology
hersæt
might
mean
footnote
manor
or
possibly
some
footnote
local
chieftain
in
ancient
times
might
have
held
sway
there
and
the
daughter
was
the
proudest
maiden
for
far
around
and
the
jarl
himself
comes
to
ask
her
hand
and
the
year
after
she
bears
him
a
son
who
becomes
king
in
a
word
i
would
go
to
hersæt
seeing
it
was
all
the
same
where
i
went
i
would
go
there
possibly
i
might
get
work
at
the
lensmand
or
there
was
always
the
chance
of
something
turning
up
at
any
rate
i
should
see
new
people
and
having
thus
decided
upon
hersæt
i
felt
i
had
a
purpose
before
me
the
good
woman
gives
me
leave
to
lie
down
on
her
bed
for
i
am
drowsy
and
stupid
for
lack
of
sleep
a
fine
blue
spider
clambers
slowly
up
the
wall
and
i
lie
watching
it
till
i
fall
asleep
after
a
couple
of
hours
i
wake
suddenly
feeling
rested
and
fresh
the
woman
was
cooking
the
dinner
i
pack
up
my
sack
pay
her
for
my
stay
and
end
up
by
saying
i
like
to
make
an
exchange
my
for
olga
picture
there
the
woman
incredulous
as
ever
never
mind
say
i
if
she
was
content
why
so
was
i
the
picture
was
of
value
i
knew
what
i
was
doing
i
took
down
the
picture
from
the
wall
blew
the
dust
from
it
and
rolled
it
up
carefully
the
wall
showed
lighter
in
a
square
patch
where
it
had
been
then
i
took
my
leave
the
woman
followed
me
out
would
i
wait
now
till
olga
came
back
so
she
could
thank
me
oh
now
if
i
only
would
i
could
had
time
tell
her
from
me
if
there
was
anything
she
could
make
out
to
look
in
the
directions
the
woman
stood
looking
after
me
as
i
went
i
swaggered
down
the
road
whistling
with
satisfaction
at
what
i
had
done
only
the
sack
to
carry
now
i
was
rested
the
sun
was
shining
and
the
road
had
dried
up
a
little
i
fell
to
singing
with
satisfaction
at
what
i
had
done
neurasthenia
i
reached
hersæt
the
following
day
at
first
i
felt
like
passing
by
it
looked
so
big
and
fine
a
place
but
after
i
had
talked
a
bit
with
one
of
the
i
decided
to
try
the
lensmand
after
all
i
had
worked
for
rich
people
before
let
me
see
there
was
captain
falkenberg
of
øvrebø
the
lensmand
was
a
little
man
with
a
long
white
beard
and
dark
eyebrows
he
talked
gruffly
but
had
kindly
eyes
afterwards
i
found
he
was
a
merry
soul
who
could
laugh
and
jest
heartily
enough
at
times
now
and
again
too
he
would
show
a
touch
of
pride
in
his
position
and
his
wealth
and
like
to
have
it
recognized
no
i
no
work
for
you
where
do
you
come
from
i
named
some
places
i
had
lately
passed
no
money
i
suppose
and
go
about
begging
no
i
did
not
beg
i
had
money
enough
well
you
have
to
go
on
farther
i
nothing
for
you
to
do
here
the
ploughing
done
can
you
cut
staves
for
a
fence
h
well
i
do
use
wooden
fences
any
more
i
put
up
wire
do
bricklayer
work
that
a
pity
i
had
bricklayers
at
work
here
for
weeks
you
might
have
got
a
job
but
it
all
done
he
stood
poking
his
stick
in
the
ground
what
made
you
come
to
me
every
one
said
go
to
the
lensmand
if
i
wanted
oh
did
they
well
i
always
got
a
crowd
here
working
at
something
or
other
those
bricklayers
now
can
you
put
up
a
fence
that
proof
against
fowls
for
that
more
than
any
soul
on
earth
ever
could
haha
worked
for
captain
falkenberg
you
said
at
øvrebø
what
were
you
doing
there
felling
i
do
know
him
he
lives
a
long
way
off
but
i
heard
of
him
any
papers
from
him
i
showed
him
what
the
captain
had
written
come
along
with
me
said
the
lensmand
abruptly
he
led
me
round
the
house
and
into
the
kitchen
give
this
man
a
thorough
good
meal
he
come
a
long
way
and
i
sat
down
in
the
big
kitchen
to
the
best
meal
i
had
had
for
a
long
time
i
had
just
finished
when
the
lensmand
came
out
again
look
here
you
he
began
i
got
up
at
once
and
stood
straight
as
an
arrow
a
piece
of
politeness
which
i
fancy
was
not
lost
on
him
no
no
finish
your
meal
go
on
finished
sure
well
i
been
thinking
come
along
with
he
took
me
out
to
the
woodshed
you
might
do
a
bit
of
work
getting
in
firewood
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
two
men
on
the
place
but
one
of
them
i
shall
want
for
summoners
work
so
you
have
to
go
woodcutting
with
the
other
you
can
see
there
plenty
of
wood
here
as
it
is
but
it
take
no
harm
lying
here
ca
have
too
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
you
said
you
had
money
let
me
i
showed
him
the
notes
i
had
good
i
an
official
you
see
and
have
to
know
my
folk
though
i
do
suppose
you
anything
on
your
conscience
seeing
you
come
to
the
lensmand
haha
well
as
i
said
you
can
give
yourself
a
rest
today
and
start
cutting
wood
i
set
to
work
getting
ready
for
the
next
day
looked
to
my
clothes
filed
the
saw
and
ground
my
ax
i
had
no
gloves
but
it
was
hardly
weather
for
gloves
as
yet
and
there
was
nothing
else
i
was
short
of
the
lensmand
came
out
to
me
several
times
and
talked
in
a
casual
way
it
amused
him
perhaps
to
talk
to
a
strange
wanderer
here
margrethe
he
called
to
his
wife
as
she
went
across
the
courtyard
here
the
new
man
i
going
to
send
him
out
cutting
xxx
we
had
no
special
orders
but
set
to
work
as
we
thought
best
felling
trees
and
in
the
evening
the
lensmand
said
it
was
right
enough
but
he
would
show
us
himself
the
next
day
i
soon
realized
that
the
work
here
would
not
last
till
christmas
with
the
weather
we
were
having
and
the
ground
as
it
was
frost
at
night
and
no
snow
we
felled
a
deal
each
day
and
nothing
to
hinder
the
work
the
lensmand
himself
though
we
were
devilish
smart
at
felling
trees
haha
the
old
man
was
easy
to
work
with
he
often
came
out
to
us
in
the
woods
and
chatted
and
made
jokes
and
as
i
never
joked
in
return
he
took
me
no
doubt
for
a
dull
dog
but
a
steady
fellow
he
began
sending
me
on
errands
now
with
letters
to
and
from
the
post
there
were
no
children
on
the
place
no
young
folk
at
all
save
the
maids
and
one
of
the
so
the
evenings
fell
rather
long
by
way
of
passing
the
time
i
got
hold
of
some
tin
and
acids
and
some
old
pots
and
kettles
in
the
kitchen
but
that
was
soon
done
and
then
one
evening
i
came
to
write
the
following
letter
only
i
were
where
you
are
i
would
work
for
next
day
i
had
to
go
to
the
post
for
the
lensmand
i
took
my
letter
with
me
and
posted
it
i
was
very
uneasy
moreover
the
letter
looked
clumsy
as
i
sent
it
for
i
had
got
the
paper
from
the
lensmand
and
had
to
paste
a
whole
strip
of
stamps
along
the
envelope
to
cover
where
his
name
was
printed
on
i
wondered
what
she
would
say
when
she
got
it
there
was
no
name
nor
any
place
given
in
the
letter
and
so
we
work
in
the
woods
the
other
man
and
i
talk
of
our
little
affairs
working
with
heart
and
soul
and
getting
on
well
together
the
days
passed
already
worse
luck
i
could
see
the
end
of
our
work
ahead
but
i
had
a
little
hope
the
lensmand
might
find
something
else
for
me
to
do
when
the
woodcutting
was
finished
something
would
surely
turn
up
i
had
no
wish
to
set
out
wandering
anew
before
christmas
then
one
day
i
go
to
the
post
again
and
there
is
a
letter
for
me
i
can
not
understand
that
it
is
for
me
and
i
stand
turning
and
twisting
it
confusedly
but
the
man
knows
me
now
he
reads
from
the
envelope
again
and
says
yes
it
is
my
name
right
enough
and
care
of
the
lensmand
suddenly
a
thought
strikes
me
and
i
grasp
the
letter
yes
it
is
for
me
i
forgot
yes
of
course
and
i
hurry
out
into
the
road
with
something
ringing
in
my
ears
all
the
time
and
open
the
letter
and
read
ikke
til
footnote
do
not
write
skrive
to
no
name
no
place
but
so
clear
and
lovely
the
first
word
was
underlined
i
do
not
know
how
i
got
home
i
remember
i
sat
on
a
stone
by
the
roadside
and
read
the
letter
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
and
walked
on
till
i
came
to
another
stone
and
did
the
same
again
but
did
that
mean
i
might
come
and
perhaps
speak
with
her
that
little
dainty
piece
of
paper
and
the
swift
delicate
characters
her
hands
had
held
it
her
eyes
had
looked
on
it
her
breath
had
touched
it
and
then
at
the
end
a
dash
which
might
have
a
world
of
meaning
i
came
home
handed
in
the
lensmand
post
and
went
out
into
the
wood
i
was
dreaming
all
the
time
my
comrade
no
doubt
must
have
found
me
an
incomprehensible
man
seeing
me
read
a
letter
again
and
again
and
put
it
back
with
my
money
how
splendid
of
her
to
have
found
me
she
must
have
held
the
envelope
up
to
the
light
no
doubt
and
read
the
lensmand
name
under
the
stamps
then
laid
her
beautiful
head
on
one
side
and
half
closed
her
eyes
and
thought
for
a
moment
he
is
working
for
the
lensmand
at
hersæt
now
that
evening
when
we
were
back
home
the
lensmand
came
out
and
talked
to
us
of
this
and
that
and
asked
did
you
say
you
been
working
for
captain
falkenberg
at
øvrebø
i
see
he
invented
a
a
machine
a
patent
saw
for
timber
work
it
in
the
i
started
at
this
surely
he
had
invented
my
patent
saw
there
must
be
some
mistake
i
said
it
was
the
captain
who
invented
oh
was
it
no
it
was
but
the
saw
was
left
with
and
i
told
the
lensmand
all
about
it
he
went
in
to
fetch
the
paper
and
we
both
read
what
it
said
new
invention
our
correspondent
on
the
spot
of
great
importance
to
owners
of
timber
lands
principle
of
the
mechanism
is
as
follows
you
do
mean
to
say
it
your
invention
yes
it
and
the
captain
is
trying
to
steal
it
why
this
be
a
pretty
case
a
mighty
pretty
case
leave
it
to
me
did
any
one
see
you
working
on
the
thing
yes
all
his
people
on
the
place
lord
save
me
if
it
not
the
stiffest
bit
of
business
i
heard
for
a
long
time
walk
off
with
another
man
invention
and
the
money
too
why
it
might
bring
you
in
a
million
i
was
obliged
to
confess
i
could
not
understand
the
captain
do
you
haha
but
i
do
i
not
been
lensmand
all
this
time
far
nothing
no
i
had
my
suspicions
that
he
was
so
rich
as
he
pretended
well
i
send
him
a
bit
of
a
letter
from
me
just
a
line
or
so
what
do
you
say
to
that
hahaha
you
leave
it
to
but
at
this
i
began
to
feel
uneasy
the
lensmand
was
too
violent
all
at
once
it
might
well
be
that
the
captain
was
not
to
blame
in
the
matter
at
all
and
that
the
newspaper
man
had
made
the
mistake
himself
i
begged
the
lensmand
to
let
me
write
myself
and
agree
to
divide
the
proceeds
with
that
rascal
never
you
leave
the
whole
thing
in
my
hands
and
anyhow
if
you
were
to
write
yourself
you
could
set
it
out
properly
the
way
i
but
i
worked
on
him
until
at
last
he
agreed
that
i
should
write
the
first
letter
and
then
he
should
take
it
up
after
i
got
some
of
the
lensmand
paper
again
i
got
no
writing
done
that
evening
it
had
been
an
exciting
day
and
my
mind
was
all
in
a
turmoil
still
i
thought
and
reckoned
it
out
for
fruen
sake
i
would
not
write
directly
to
the
captain
and
risk
causing
her
unpleasantness
as
well
no
i
would
send
a
line
to
my
comrade
lars
falkenberg
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
machine
that
night
i
had
another
visit
from
the
corpse
that
miserable
old
woman
in
her
that
would
not
leave
me
in
peace
on
account
of
her
thumbnail
i
had
had
a
long
spell
of
emotion
the
day
before
so
this
night
she
took
care
to
come
frozen
with
horror
i
saw
her
come
gliding
in
stop
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
stretch
out
her
hand
over
against
the
other
wall
lay
my
in
his
bed
and
it
was
a
strange
relief
to
me
to
hear
that
he
too
lay
groaning
and
moving
restlessly
at
any
rate
there
were
two
of
us
to
share
the
danger
i
shook
my
head
to
say
i
had
buried
the
nail
in
a
peaceful
spot
and
could
do
no
more
but
the
corpse
stood
there
still
i
begged
her
pardon
but
then
suddenly
i
was
seized
with
a
feeling
of
annoyance
i
grew
angry
and
told
her
straight
out
i
have
no
more
of
her
nonsense
i
borrowed
that
nail
of
hers
at
a
pinch
but
i
done
all
i
could
do
months
ago
and
buried
it
again
at
that
she
came
gliding
sideways
over
to
my
pillow
trying
to
get
behind
me
i
flung
myself
up
in
bed
and
gave
a
shriek
what
is
it
asked
the
lad
from
the
other
bed
i
rub
my
eyes
and
answer
i
been
dreaming
that
was
all
who
was
it
came
in
just
now
asks
the
boy
i
do
know
was
there
any
one
in
here
i
saw
some
one
going
xxxi
after
a
couple
of
days
i
set
myself
down
calmly
and
loftily
to
write
to
falkenberg
i
had
a
bit
of
a
saw
thing
i
left
there
at
øvrebø
i
wrote
it
might
be
a
useful
thing
for
owners
of
timber
lands
some
day
and
i
proposed
to
come
along
and
fetch
it
away
shortly
please
keep
an
eye
on
it
and
see
it
does
get
damaged
yes
i
wrote
in
that
gentle
style
that
was
the
most
dignified
way
and
since
falkenberg
of
course
would
mention
it
in
the
kitchen
and
perhaps
show
the
letter
round
it
had
to
be
delicacy
itself
but
it
was
not
all
delicacy
and
nothing
else
i
fixed
a
definite
date
to
make
it
serious
i
will
come
for
the
machine
on
monday
december
i
thought
to
myself
there
that
clear
and
sound
if
the
machine
not
there
that
monday
why
then
something
will
happen
i
took
the
letter
to
the
post
myself
and
stuck
a
strip
of
stamps
across
the
envelope
as
before
my
beautiful
ecstasy
was
still
on
me
i
had
received
the
loveliest
letter
in
the
world
here
it
was
in
my
breast
pocket
it
was
to
me
no
indeed
but
i
could
come
and
then
a
dash
at
the
end
there
was
anything
wrong
by
any
chance
about
that
underlining
the
word
as
for
instance
meaning
to
emphasize
the
whole
thing
as
an
order
ladies
were
always
so
fond
of
underlining
all
sorts
of
words
and
putting
in
dashes
here
there
and
everywhere
but
not
she
no
not
she
a
few
days
more
and
the
work
at
the
lensmand
would
be
at
an
end
it
fitted
in
very
well
everything
worked
out
nicely
on
the
i
was
to
be
at
øvrebø
and
that
perhaps
not
a
minute
too
soon
if
the
captain
really
had
any
idea
of
his
own
about
my
machine
it
would
be
necessary
to
act
at
once
was
a
stranger
to
come
stealing
my
million
had
i
toiled
for
it
i
almost
began
to
regret
the
gentleness
of
my
letter
to
falkenberg
i
might
have
made
it
a
good
deal
sharper
now
perhaps
he
would
imagine
i
was
too
soft
to
stand
up
for
myself
why
he
might
even
take
it
into
his
head
to
bear
witness
against
me
and
say
i
had
invented
the
machine
at
all
hoho
master
falkenberg
just
try
it
on
in
the
first
place
cost
you
your
eternal
salvation
and
if
that
not
enough
i
have
you
up
for
perjury
before
my
friend
and
patron
the
lensmand
and
you
know
what
that
mean
of
course
you
must
go
said
the
lensmand
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
it
and
just
come
back
here
to
me
with
your
machine
you
must
look
after
your
interests
of
course
it
may
be
a
question
of
something
the
following
day
post
brought
a
piece
of
news
that
changed
the
situation
in
a
moment
there
was
a
letter
from
captain
falkenberg
himself
in
the
paper
saying
it
was
due
to
a
misunderstanding
that
the
new
timber
saw
had
been
stated
as
being
of
his
invention
the
apparatus
had
been
designed
by
a
man
who
had
worked
on
his
estate
some
time
back
as
to
its
value
he
would
not
express
any
captain
falkenberg
the
lensmand
and
i
looked
at
each
other
well
what
do
you
say
now
he
asked
that
the
captain
at
any
rate
is
ho
know
what
i
think
pause
the
lensmand
playing
lensmand
from
top
to
toe
unravelling
schemes
and
plots
he
is
not
innocent
said
he
really
ah
i
seen
that
sort
of
thing
before
drawing
in
his
horns
all
your
letter
put
him
on
his
guard
haha
at
this
i
had
to
confess
to
the
lensmand
that
i
had
not
written
to
the
captain
at
all
but
had
merely
sent
a
bit
of
a
note
to
one
of
the
hands
at
øvrebø
and
even
that
letter
could
not
have
reached
there
yet
seeing
it
was
only
posted
the
night
before
this
left
the
lensmand
dumb
and
he
gave
up
unravelling
things
on
the
other
hand
he
seemed
from
now
onward
to
be
greatly
in
doubt
as
to
whether
the
whole
thing
had
any
value
at
all
quite
likely
the
machine
no
good
at
all
he
said
but
then
he
added
kindly
i
mean
it
may
need
touching
up
a
bit
and
improving
seen
yourself
how
they
always
altering
things
like
warships
and
are
you
still
determined
to
go
no
more
was
said
about
my
coming
back
here
and
bringing
the
machine
with
me
but
the
lensmand
wrote
me
a
very
nice
recommendation
he
would
gladly
have
kept
me
on
longer
it
said
but
the
work
was
interrupted
by
private
affairs
of
my
own
elsewhere
in
the
morning
when
i
was
ready
to
start
a
little
girl
stood
in
the
courtyard
waiting
for
me
to
come
out
it
was
olga
was
there
ever
such
a
child
she
must
have
been
afoot
since
midnight
to
get
here
so
early
and
there
she
stood
in
her
blue
skirt
and
her
jacket
that
you
olga
where
are
you
going
she
had
come
to
see
me
how
did
she
know
i
was
here
she
had
asked
about
me
and
found
out
where
i
was
and
please
was
it
true
she
was
to
keep
the
but
of
course
it
could
yes
the
machine
was
hers
all
right
had
i
taken
her
picture
in
exchange
did
it
work
all
right
yes
it
worked
all
right
we
did
not
talk
much
together
i
wanted
to
get
her
away
before
the
lensmand
came
out
and
began
asking
questions
well
run
along
home
now
child
you
a
long
way
to
olga
gives
me
her
hand
it
is
swallowed
up
completely
in
mine
and
she
lets
it
lie
there
as
long
as
i
will
then
she
thanks
me
and
shambles
gaily
off
again
and
her
toes
turning
in
and
out
all
odd
ways
xxxii
i
am
nearly
at
my
goal
sunday
evening
i
lay
in
a
watchman
hut
not
far
from
øvrebø
so
as
to
be
on
the
place
early
monday
morning
by
nine
every
one
would
be
up
then
surely
i
must
be
lucky
enough
to
meet
the
one
i
sought
i
had
grown
dreadfully
nervous
and
kept
imagining
ugly
things
i
had
written
a
nice
letter
to
falkenberg
using
no
sharp
words
but
the
captain
might
after
all
have
been
offended
at
my
fixing
the
date
like
that
giving
him
so
and
so
much
time
if
only
i
had
never
written
at
all
coming
up
towards
the
house
i
stoop
more
and
more
and
make
myself
small
though
indeed
i
had
done
no
wrong
i
turn
off
from
the
road
up
and
go
round
so
as
to
reach
the
outbuildings
first
and
there
i
come
upon
falkenberg
he
is
washing
down
the
carriage
we
gave
each
other
greeting
and
were
the
same
good
comrades
as
before
was
he
going
out
with
the
carriage
no
just
come
back
the
night
before
been
to
the
railway
station
who
had
gone
away
then
fruen
fruen
fruen
yes
pause
really
and
where
was
fruen
gone
to
gone
to
stay
in
town
for
a
bit
pause
stranger
man
been
here
writing
in
the
papers
about
that
machine
of
yours
says
falkenberg
is
the
captain
gone
away
too
no
captain
at
home
you
should
have
seen
his
face
when
your
letter
i
got
falkenberg
to
come
up
to
the
old
loft
i
had
still
two
bottles
of
wine
in
my
sack
and
i
took
them
out
and
we
started
on
them
together
eh
those
bottles
that
i
had
carried
backward
and
forward
mile
after
mile
and
had
to
be
so
careful
with
they
served
me
well
just
now
save
for
them
falkenberg
would
never
have
said
so
much
what
was
that
about
the
captain
and
my
letter
did
he
see
it
well
it
began
like
this
said
falkenberg
fruen
was
in
the
kitchen
when
i
came
in
with
the
post
letter
that
with
all
those
stamps
on
she
says
i
opened
it
and
said
it
was
from
you
to
say
you
were
coming
on
the
and
what
did
she
say
she
did
say
any
more
yes
she
asked
once
again
on
the
is
he
and
i
said
yes
he
and
then
a
couple
of
days
after
you
got
orders
to
drive
her
to
the
station
why
yes
it
must
have
been
about
a
couple
of
days
well
then
i
thought
if
fruen
knows
about
the
letter
then
captain
surely
knows
too
know
what
he
said
when
i
brought
it
in
i
made
no
answer
to
this
but
thought
and
thought
there
must
be
something
behind
all
this
was
she
running
away
from
me
madman
the
captain
lady
at
øvrebø
would
not
run
away
from
one
of
her
labourers
but
the
whole
thing
seemed
so
strange
i
had
hoped
all
along
she
would
give
me
leave
to
speak
with
her
since
i
was
forbidden
to
write
falkenberg
went
on
a
little
awkwardly
well
i
showed
the
captain
your
letter
though
you
did
say
i
was
to
was
there
any
harm
in
that
it
does
matter
what
did
he
say
look
after
the
machine
do
he
said
and
made
a
face
case
any
one
comes
to
steal
it
he
then
the
captain
angry
with
me
now
nay
i
should
think
so
i
heard
no
more
about
it
since
that
it
mattered
little
after
all
about
the
captain
when
falkenberg
had
taken
a
deal
of
wine
i
asked
him
if
he
knew
where
fruen
was
staying
in
town
no
but
emma
might
perhaps
we
get
hold
of
emma
treat
her
to
wine
talk
a
lot
of
nonsense
and
work
gradually
round
to
the
point
at
last
asking
in
a
delicate
way
no
emma
did
know
the
address
but
fruen
had
gone
to
buy
things
for
christmas
and
she
was
going
with
frøken
elisabeth
from
the
vicarage
so
they
know
the
address
there
what
did
i
want
it
for
by
the
way
well
it
was
only
about
a
filigree
brooch
i
had
got
hold
of
and
wanted
to
ask
if
she
care
to
buy
it
let
luckily
i
was
able
to
show
her
the
brooch
it
was
a
beautiful
piece
of
old
work
i
had
bought
it
of
one
of
the
maids
at
hersæt
fruen
would
have
it
said
emma
i
would
have
it
not
if
you
got
me
into
the
bargain
emma
what
and
i
forced
myself
to
jest
again
emma
goes
off
i
try
drawing
out
falkenberg
again
falkenberg
was
sharp
enough
at
times
to
understand
people
did
he
still
sing
for
fruen
lord
no
that
was
all
over
falkenberg
wished
he
had
taken
service
here
at
all
was
nothing
but
trouble
and
misery
about
the
place
trouble
and
misery
were
they
friends
then
the
captain
and
his
lady
oh
yes
they
were
friends
in
the
same
old
way
last
saturday
she
had
been
crying
all
day
funny
thing
it
should
be
like
that
say
i
when
they
so
upright
and
considerate
towards
each
and
i
watch
to
see
what
falkenberg
says
to
that
eh
but
they
ever
weary
says
falkenberg
in
his
valdres
dialect
and
she
losing
her
looks
too
only
in
the
time
you
been
gone
she
got
all
pale
and
i
sat
up
in
the
loft
for
a
couple
of
hours
keeping
an
eye
on
the
main
building
from
my
window
but
the
captain
did
not
appear
why
did
he
go
out
it
was
hopeless
to
wait
any
longer
i
should
have
to
go
without
making
my
excuses
to
the
captain
i
could
have
found
good
grounds
enough
i
might
have
put
the
blame
on
to
the
first
article
in
the
paper
and
said
it
had
rather
turned
my
head
for
the
moment
and
there
was
some
truth
in
that
well
all
i
had
to
do
now
was
to
tie
up
the
machine
in
a
bundle
cover
it
up
as
far
as
possible
with
my
sack
and
start
off
on
my
wanderings
again
emma
stole
some
food
for
me
before
i
went
it
was
another
long
journey
this
time
first
to
the
vicarage
though
that
was
but
a
little
out
of
the
way
and
then
on
to
the
railway
station
a
little
snow
was
falling
which
made
it
rather
heavy
walking
and
what
was
more
i
could
not
take
it
easy
now
but
must
get
on
as
fast
as
i
could
the
ladies
were
only
staying
in
town
for
their
christmas
shopping
and
they
had
a
good
start
already
on
the
following
afternoon
i
came
to
the
vicarage
i
had
reckoned
out
it
would
be
best
to
speak
with
fruen
i
on
my
way
into
town
i
told
her
and
i
this
machine
thing
with
me
if
i
might
leave
the
heaviest
of
the
woodwork
here
meanwhile
are
you
going
into
town
says
fruen
but
you
stay
here
till
tomorrow
surely
no
thanks
all
the
same
i
got
to
be
in
town
fruen
thinks
for
a
bit
and
then
says
elisabeth
in
town
you
might
take
a
parcel
in
for
her
something
she
that
gives
me
the
address
i
thought
to
myself
but
i
got
to
get
it
ready
then
frøken
elisabeth
might
be
gone
again
before
i
got
there
oh
no
she
with
fru
falkenberg
and
they
staying
in
town
for
the
this
was
grand
news
joyous
news
now
i
had
both
the
address
and
the
time
fruen
stands
watching
me
sideways
and
says
well
then
you
stay
the
night
wo
you
you
see
it
something
i
got
to
get
ready
first
i
was
given
a
room
in
the
main
building
because
it
was
too
cold
to
sleep
in
the
barn
and
when
all
the
household
had
gone
to
rest
that
night
and
everything
was
quiet
came
fruen
to
my
room
with
the
parcel
and
said
excuse
my
coming
so
late
but
i
thought
you
might
be
going
early
morning
before
i
was
xxxiii
so
here
i
am
once
more
in
the
crush
and
noise
of
a
city
with
its
newspapers
and
people
i
have
been
away
from
all
this
for
many
months
now
and
find
it
not
unpleasant
i
spend
a
morning
taking
it
all
in
get
hold
of
some
other
clothes
and
set
off
to
find
frøken
elisabeth
at
her
address
she
was
staying
with
some
relatives
and
now
should
i
be
lucky
enough
to
meet
the
other
one
i
am
restless
as
a
boy
my
hands
are
vulgarly
unused
to
gloves
and
i
pull
them
off
then
going
up
the
step
i
notice
that
my
hands
do
not
go
at
all
well
with
the
clothes
i
am
wearing
and
i
put
on
my
gloves
again
then
i
ring
the
bell
frøken
elisabeth
yes
would
you
wait
a
moment
frøken
elisabeth
comes
out
you
wished
to
speak
to
oh
is
it
you
i
had
brought
a
parcel
from
her
mother
she
tears
open
the
parcel
and
looks
inside
oh
fancy
mama
thinking
of
that
the
we
been
to
the
theatre
already
i
recognize
you
at
really
it
not
so
very
long
since
no
but
tell
me
is
there
any
one
else
you
like
to
inquire
about
haha
yes
said
i
well
she
not
here
i
only
staying
here
with
my
relations
no
she
at
the
well
the
parcel
was
for
you
said
i
trying
to
master
my
disappointment
wait
a
minute
i
was
just
going
out
again
we
can
go
frøken
elisabeth
puts
on
some
calls
out
through
a
door
to
say
she
wo
be
very
long
and
goes
out
with
me
we
take
a
cab
and
drive
to
a
quiet
café
frøken
elisabeth
says
yes
she
loves
going
to
cafés
but
there
nothing
very
amusing
about
this
one
would
she
rather
go
somewhere
else
yes
to
the
i
hesitated
it
might
be
hardly
safe
i
had
been
away
for
a
long
time
now
and
if
we
met
any
one
i
knew
i
might
have
to
talk
to
them
but
frøkenen
insisted
on
grand
she
had
had
but
a
few
days
practice
in
the
capital
and
had
already
gained
a
deal
of
but
i
liked
her
so
much
before
we
drove
off
again
to
grand
it
was
getting
towards
evening
frøkenen
picks
out
a
seat
right
in
the
brightest
spot
beaming
all
over
herself
at
the
fun
of
it
i
ordered
some
wine
what
fine
clothes
you
wearing
now
she
says
with
a
laugh
i
could
very
well
come
in
here
in
a
workman
no
of
course
not
but
honestly
that
blouse
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
think
yes
the
blouse
suited
you
there
devil
take
these
town
clothes
i
sat
there
with
my
head
full
of
other
things
and
did
not
care
for
this
sort
of
talk
are
you
staying
long
in
town
i
asked
as
long
as
lovise
does
we
finished
our
shopping
no
i
sorry
it
all
too
then
she
turns
gay
once
more
and
asks
laughingly
did
you
like
being
with
us
out
in
the
country
yes
that
was
a
pleasant
and
will
you
come
again
soon
haha
she
seemed
to
be
making
fun
of
me
trying
of
course
to
show
she
saw
through
me
that
i
had
played
my
part
well
enough
as
a
country
labourer
child
that
she
was
i
could
teach
many
a
labourer
his
business
and
had
more
than
one
trade
at
my
though
in
my
true
calling
i
manage
to
achieve
just
the
next
best
of
all
i
dream
shall
i
ask
papa
to
put
up
a
notice
on
the
post
next
spring
to
say
you
willing
to
lay
down
and
so
on
she
closed
her
eyes
and
laughed
so
heartily
she
laughed
i
am
torn
with
excitement
and
her
merriment
pains
me
though
it
is
all
enough
i
glance
round
the
place
trying
to
pull
myself
together
here
and
there
an
acquaintance
nods
to
me
and
i
return
it
it
all
seems
so
far
away
to
me
i
was
sitting
with
a
charming
girl
and
that
made
people
notice
us
you
know
these
people
it
seems
yes
one
or
two
of
them
have
you
enjoyed
yourself
in
town
oh
yes
immensely
i
two
boy
cousins
here
and
then
there
were
their
friends
as
poor
young
erik
out
in
the
country
said
i
jestingly
oh
you
with
your
young
erik
no
there
one
here
in
town
his
bewer
but
i
not
friends
with
him
just
oh
that
wo
last
do
you
think
so
really
though
i
rather
serious
about
it
i
an
idea
he
might
be
coming
in
here
this
you
must
point
him
out
to
me
if
he
i
thought
as
we
drove
out
here
that
you
and
i
could
sit
here
together
you
know
and
make
him
right
then
we
yes
but
no
you
have
to
be
a
bit
younger
i
mean
i
forced
myself
to
laugh
oh
we
would
manage
all
right
do
despise
us
old
ones
us
ancient
ones
we
can
be
quite
surprisingly
useful
at
times
only
you
better
let
me
sit
on
the
sofa
beside
you
there
so
he
ca
see
i
bald
at
the
eh
but
it
is
hard
to
take
that
perilous
transition
to
old
age
in
any
quiet
and
beautiful
way
there
comes
a
forcedness
a
play
of
jerky
effort
and
grimaces
the
fight
against
those
younger
than
ourselves
and
envy
frøken
i
ask
this
of
her
now
with
all
my
heart
frøken
you
ring
up
fru
falkenberg
and
get
her
to
come
round
here
now
she
thinks
for
a
moment
yes
we
will
she
says
generously
we
go
out
to
the
telephone
ring
up
the
victoria
fruen
is
there
is
that
you
lovise
you
never
guess
who
i
with
now
wo
you
come
along
oh
good
we
at
the
grand
no
i
ca
tell
you
now
yes
of
course
it
a
man
only
he
a
gentleman
now
i
wo
say
who
it
is
are
you
coming
why
you
said
just
now
you
would
some
people
oh
well
do
as
you
like
of
course
but
i
do
think
yes
he
standing
here
you
are
in
a
hurry
frøken
elisabeth
rang
off
and
said
shortly
she
had
to
go
and
see
some
we
went
back
to
our
seat
and
had
some
more
wine
i
tried
to
be
cheerful
and
suggested
champagne
yes
thanks
and
then
as
sitting
there
frøkenen
says
suddenly
oh
there
bewer
i
so
glad
we
drinking
but
i
have
only
one
idea
in
my
mind
and
being
now
called
upon
to
show
what
i
can
do
and
charm
this
young
lady
to
the
ultimate
advantage
of
some
one
else
i
find
myself
saying
one
thing
and
thinking
another
which
of
course
leads
to
disaster
i
can
not
get
that
telephone
conversation
out
of
my
head
she
must
have
had
an
idea
have
realized
that
it
was
i
who
was
waiting
for
her
here
but
what
on
earth
had
i
done
why
had
i
been
dismissed
so
suddenly
from
øvrebø
and
falkenberg
taken
on
in
my
place
quite
possibly
the
captain
and
his
wife
were
not
always
the
best
of
friends
but
the
captain
had
scented
danger
in
my
being
there
and
wished
to
save
his
wife
at
least
from
such
an
ignominious
fall
and
now
here
she
was
feeling
ashamed
that
i
had
worked
on
her
place
that
she
had
used
me
to
drive
her
carriage
and
twice
shared
food
with
me
by
the
way
and
she
was
ashamed
too
of
my
being
no
longer
young
this
will
never
do
says
frøken
elisabeth
so
i
pull
myself
together
again
and
start
saying
all
manner
of
foolish
things
to
make
her
laugh
i
drink
a
good
deal
and
that
helps
at
last
she
really
seems
to
fancy
i
am
making
myself
agreeable
to
her
on
her
own
account
she
looks
at
me
curiously
no
really
though
do
you
think
i
nice
oh
please
do
you
understand
i
was
speaking
of
fru
sh
says
frøken
elisabeth
of
course
it
is
fru
falkenberg
i
know
that
perfectly
well
but
you
need
not
say
so
i
really
think
beginning
to
make
an
impression
on
him
over
there
let
go
on
like
we
are
doing
and
look
so
she
had
imagined
i
was
trying
on
my
own
account
after
all
i
was
too
old
for
that
sort
of
thing
anyway
devil
take
it
yes
of
course
but
you
ca
get
fru
falkenberg
she
says
beginning
again
simply
no
i
ca
get
her
nor
you
are
you
speaking
to
fru
falkenberg
now
again
no
it
was
to
you
this
pause
do
you
know
i
was
in
love
with
you
yes
when
i
was
at
this
is
getting
quite
amusing
said
i
shifting
up
on
the
sofa
oh
we
manage
bewer
never
yes
only
fancy
i
used
to
go
up
to
the
churchyard
to
meet
you
in
the
evenings
but
you
foolish
person
you
did
see
it
a
now
you
talking
to
bewer
of
course
said
i
no
it
perfectly
true
and
i
came
over
one
day
when
you
were
working
in
the
potato
fields
it
was
your
young
erik
i
came
to
see
not
a
only
think
that
it
should
have
been
me
i
say
putting
on
a
melancholy
air
yes
of
course
you
think
it
was
strange
but
really
you
know
people
who
live
in
the
country
must
have
some
one
to
be
fond
of
does
fru
falkenberg
say
the
same
fru
falkenberg
no
she
says
she
does
want
to
be
fond
of
anybody
only
play
her
piano
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
i
was
speaking
of
myself
do
you
know
what
i
did
once
no
really
i
ca
tell
you
that
do
you
want
to
know
yes
tell
well
then
for
after
all
i
only
a
child
compared
to
you
so
it
does
matter
it
was
when
you
were
sleeping
in
the
barn
i
went
over
there
one
day
and
laid
your
rugs
together
properly
and
made
a
proper
was
it
you
did
that
i
burst
out
quite
sincerely
forgetting
to
play
my
part
you
ought
to
have
seen
me
stealing
in
hahaha
but
this
young
girl
was
not
artful
enough
she
changed
colour
at
her
little
confession
and
laughed
forcedly
to
cover
her
confusion
i
try
to
help
her
out
and
say
you
really
you
know
fru
falkenberg
would
never
have
done
a
thing
like
no
but
then
she
older
did
you
think
we
were
the
same
age
does
fru
falkenberg
say
she
does
to
be
fond
of
anybody
yes
oh
no
bother
i
do
know
fru
falkenberg
married
of
course
she
does
say
anything
now
talk
to
me
again
a
little
yes
and
do
you
remember
the
time
we
went
up
to
the
store
to
buy
things
you
know
and
i
kept
walking
slower
and
slower
for
you
to
catch
up
yes
that
was
nice
of
you
and
now
i
do
something
for
you
in
i
rose
from
my
seat
and
walked
across
to
where
young
bewer
sat
and
asked
if
he
would
not
care
to
join
us
at
our
table
i
brought
him
along
frøken
elisabeth
flushed
hotly
as
he
came
up
then
i
talked
those
two
young
people
well
together
which
done
i
suddenly
remembered
i
had
some
business
to
do
and
must
go
off
at
once
i
ever
so
sorry
to
leave
just
now
frøken
elisabeth
i
afraid
you
turned
my
head
bewitched
me
completely
but
i
realize
it
hopeless
to
think
of
it
it
a
marvel
to
me
by
the
way
xxxiv
i
shambled
over
to
raadhusgaten
and
stood
awhile
by
the
cab
stand
watching
the
entrance
to
the
victoria
but
of
course
she
had
gone
to
see
some
friends
i
drifted
into
the
hotel
and
got
talking
to
the
porter
yes
fruen
was
in
room
no
first
floor
then
she
was
not
out
visiting
friends
no
was
she
leaving
shortly
fruen
had
not
said
so
i
went
out
into
the
street
again
and
the
cabmen
flung
up
their
aprons
inviting
my
patronage
i
picked
out
a
cab
and
got
in
where
to
just
stay
where
you
are
i
hiring
you
by
the
the
cabmen
walk
about
whispering
one
suggesting
this
another
that
he
watching
the
place
out
to
catch
his
wife
meeting
some
commercial
traveller
yes
i
am
watching
the
place
there
is
a
light
in
one
or
two
of
the
rooms
and
suddenly
it
strikes
me
that
she
might
stand
at
a
window
and
see
me
wait
i
say
to
the
cabman
and
go
into
the
hotel
again
whereabouts
is
no
first
looking
out
on
to
raadhusgaten
then
it
must
have
been
my
sister
i
say
inventing
something
in
order
to
slip
past
the
porter
i
go
up
the
stairs
and
to
give
myself
no
chance
of
turning
back
i
knock
at
the
door
the
moment
i
have
seen
the
number
no
answer
i
knock
again
is
it
the
maid
comes
a
voice
from
within
i
could
not
answer
yes
my
voice
would
have
betrayed
me
i
tried
the
handle
the
door
was
locked
perhaps
she
had
been
afraid
i
might
come
possibly
she
had
seen
me
outside
no
it
not
the
maid
i
say
and
i
can
hear
how
the
words
quiver
strangely
i
stand
listening
a
long
while
after
that
i
can
hear
someone
moving
inside
but
the
door
remains
closed
then
come
two
short
rings
from
one
of
the
rooms
down
to
the
hall
it
must
be
she
i
say
to
myself
she
is
feeling
uneasy
and
has
rung
for
the
maid
i
move
away
from
her
door
to
avoid
any
awkwardness
for
her
and
when
the
maid
comes
i
walk
past
as
if
going
downstairs
then
the
maid
says
yes
the
maid
and
the
door
is
opened
no
says
the
maid
only
a
gentleman
going
i
thought
of
taking
a
room
at
the
hotel
but
the
idea
was
distasteful
to
me
she
was
not
a
runaway
wife
meeting
commercial
travellers
when
i
came
down
i
remarked
to
the
porter
as
i
passed
that
fruen
seemed
to
be
lying
down
then
i
went
out
and
got
into
my
cab
again
the
time
passes
a
whole
hour
the
cabman
wants
to
know
if
i
do
not
feel
cold
well
yes
a
little
was
i
waiting
for
some
one
yes
he
hands
me
down
his
rug
from
the
box
and
i
tip
him
the
price
of
a
drink
for
his
thoughtfulness
time
goes
on
hour
after
hour
the
cabmen
talk
unrestrainedly
now
saying
openly
one
to
another
that
i
letting
the
horse
freeze
to
death
no
it
was
no
good
i
paid
for
the
cab
went
home
and
wrote
the
following
letter
you
would
not
let
me
write
to
you
will
you
not
let
me
see
you
once
again
i
will
ask
for
you
at
the
hotel
at
five
should
i
have
fixed
an
earlier
hour
but
the
light
in
the
forenoon
was
so
white
if
i
felt
moved
and
my
mouth
twitched
i
should
look
a
dreadful
sight
i
took
the
letter
round
myself
to
the
hotel
and
went
home
again
a
long
night
oh
how
long
were
those
hours
now
when
i
ought
to
sleep
and
stretch
myself
and
feel
refreshed
i
could
not
day
dawned
and
i
got
up
after
a
long
ramble
through
the
streets
i
came
back
home
again
and
slept
hours
pass
when
i
awake
and
come
to
my
senses
i
hurry
anxiously
to
the
telephone
to
ask
if
fruen
had
left
no
fruen
had
not
left
thank
heaven
then
it
seemed
she
did
not
wish
to
run
away
from
me
she
must
have
had
my
letter
long
since
no
i
had
called
at
an
awkward
hour
the
evening
before
that
was
all
i
had
something
to
eat
lay
down
and
slept
again
when
i
woke
it
was
past
noon
i
stumble
in
to
the
telephone
again
and
ring
up
as
before
no
fruen
had
not
left
yet
but
her
things
were
packed
she
was
out
just
now
i
got
ready
at
once
and
hurried
round
to
raadhusgaten
to
stand
on
watch
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
i
saw
a
number
of
people
pass
in
and
out
not
the
one
i
sought
it
was
five
now
and
i
went
in
and
spoke
to
the
porter
fruen
was
gone
gone
was
it
you
that
rang
up
she
came
just
at
that
moment
and
took
her
things
but
i
a
letter
i
took
the
letter
and
without
opening
it
asked
about
the
train
train
left
at
says
the
porter
looking
at
his
watch
it
five
i
had
thrown
away
half
an
hour
keeping
watch
outside
i
sit
down
on
one
of
the
steps
staring
at
the
floor
the
porter
keeps
on
talking
he
must
be
well
aware
it
was
not
my
sister
i
said
to
fruen
there
was
a
gentleman
had
just
rung
up
but
she
only
said
she
had
time
and
would
i
give
him
this
was
there
another
lady
with
her
when
she
left
i
got
up
and
went
out
in
the
street
i
opened
the
letter
and
read
you
not
follow
me
about
any
more
impassively
i
put
the
thing
away
it
had
not
surprised
me
had
made
no
new
impression
thoroughly
womanly
hasty
words
written
on
impulse
with
underlining
and
a
dash
then
it
occurred
to
me
to
go
round
to
frøken
elisabeth
address
there
was
still
a
glimmer
of
hope
i
heard
the
door
bell
ring
inside
the
house
as
i
pressed
and
stood
listening
as
in
a
whirling
desert
frøken
elisabeth
had
left
an
hour
before
then
wine
and
then
whisky
and
then
endless
whisky
and
altogether
a
days
debauch
in
the
course
of
which
a
curtain
falls
and
hides
my
earthly
consciousness
in
this
state
it
enters
my
head
one
day
to
send
something
to
a
little
cottage
in
the
country
it
is
a
mirror
in
a
gay
gilt
frame
and
it
was
for
a
little
maid
by
name
olga
a
creature
touching
and
sweet
to
watch
as
a
young
calf
ay
for
i
not
got
over
my
neurasthenia
yet
the
timber
saw
is
in
my
room
but
i
can
not
put
it
together
for
the
bulk
of
the
wooden
parts
i
left
behind
at
a
vicarage
in
the
country
it
matters
little
now
my
love
for
the
thing
is
dulled
my
neurasthenic
friends
believe
me
folk
of
our
sort
are
useless
as
human
beings
and
we
should
not
even
do
for
any
kind
of
beast
one
day
i
suppose
i
shall
grow
tired
of
this
unconsciousness
and
go
out
and
live
on
an
island
once
again
a
wanderer
plays
on
muted
strings
introduction
it
looks
to
be
a
fine
year
for
berries
yes
whortleberries
crowberries
and
fintocks
a
man
ca
live
on
berries
true
enough
but
it
is
good
to
have
them
growing
all
about
and
a
kindly
thing
to
see
and
many
a
thirsty
and
hungry
man
been
glad
to
find
them
i
was
thinking
of
this
only
yesterday
evening
there
two
or
three
months
yet
till
the
late
autumn
berries
are
ripe
yes
i
know
but
there
are
other
joys
than
berries
in
the
wilds
spring
and
summer
they
are
still
only
in
bloom
but
there
are
harebells
and
ladyslippers
deep
windless
woods
and
the
scent
of
trees
and
stillness
there
is
a
sound
as
of
distant
waters
from
the
heavens
never
so
a
sound
in
all
eternity
and
a
thrush
may
be
singing
as
high
as
ever
its
voice
can
go
and
then
just
at
its
highest
pitch
the
note
breaks
suddenly
at
a
right
angle
clear
and
clean
as
if
cut
with
a
diamond
then
softly
and
sweetly
down
the
scale
once
more
along
the
shore
too
there
is
life
guillemot
tern
are
busy
there
the
wagtail
is
out
in
search
of
food
advancing
in
little
spurts
trim
and
pert
with
its
pointed
beak
and
swift
little
flick
of
a
tail
after
a
while
it
flies
up
to
perch
on
a
fence
and
sing
with
the
rest
but
when
the
sun
has
set
may
come
the
cry
of
a
loon
from
some
a
melancholy
hurrah
that
is
the
last
now
there
is
only
the
grasshopper
left
and
there
nothing
to
say
of
a
grasshopper
you
never
see
it
it
does
count
only
he
there
gritting
his
resiny
teeth
as
you
might
say
i
sit
and
think
of
all
these
things
of
how
summer
has
its
joys
for
a
wanderer
so
there
no
sort
of
need
to
wait
till
autumn
comes
and
here
i
am
writing
cool
words
of
these
quiet
things
for
all
the
world
as
if
there
were
no
violent
and
perilous
happenings
ahead
is
a
trick
and
i
learned
it
of
a
man
in
the
southern
hemisphere
of
a
mexican
called
rough
the
brim
of
his
huge
hat
was
hung
with
tinkling
sequins
that
in
itself
was
a
thing
to
remember
and
most
of
all
i
remember
how
calmly
he
told
the
story
of
his
first
murder
i
a
sweetheart
once
named
maria
said
rough
with
that
patient
look
of
his
well
she
was
no
more
than
sixteen
and
i
was
nineteen
then
she
such
little
hands
when
you
touched
them
fingers
thin
and
slight
you
know
the
sort
one
evening
the
master
called
her
in
from
the
fields
to
do
some
sewing
for
him
no
help
for
it
then
and
it
was
more
than
a
day
again
before
he
calls
her
in
same
as
before
well
it
went
on
like
that
a
few
weeks
and
then
stopped
seven
months
after
maria
died
and
they
buried
her
little
hands
and
all
i
went
to
her
brother
inez
and
said
six
tomorrow
morning
the
master
rides
to
town
and
he
be
alone
know
said
he
might
lend
me
that
little
rifle
of
yours
to
shoot
him
with
shall
be
using
it
myself
said
he
then
we
talked
for
a
bit
about
other
things
the
crops
and
a
big
new
well
we
dug
and
when
i
left
i
reached
down
his
rifle
from
the
wall
and
took
it
with
me
in
the
timber
i
heard
inez
at
my
heels
calling
to
me
to
stop
we
sat
down
and
talked
a
bit
more
this
way
and
that
then
inez
snatched
the
rifle
away
from
me
and
went
home
next
morning
i
was
up
early
and
out
at
the
gate
ready
to
open
it
for
the
master
inez
was
there
too
hiding
in
the
bushes
i
told
him
he
better
go
on
ahead
we
did
want
to
be
two
to
one
pistols
in
his
belt
said
inez
what
about
you
know
said
i
i
a
lump
of
lead
here
and
that
makes
no
noise
i
showed
him
the
lump
of
lead
and
he
thought
for
a
bit
then
he
went
home
then
the
master
came
riding
up
grey
and
old
he
was
sixty
at
least
the
gate
he
called
out
but
i
did
he
thought
i
must
be
mad
no
doubt
and
lashed
out
at
me
with
his
whip
but
i
paid
no
heed
at
last
he
had
to
get
down
himself
to
open
the
gate
then
i
gave
him
the
first
blow
it
got
him
just
by
one
eye
and
cut
a
hole
he
said
and
dropped
i
said
a
few
words
to
him
but
he
understand
after
a
few
more
blows
he
was
dead
he
a
deal
of
money
on
him
i
took
a
little
to
help
me
on
my
way
then
i
mounted
and
rode
off
inez
was
standing
in
the
doorway
as
i
rode
past
his
place
only
three
and
a
half
days
to
the
frontier
he
so
rough
told
his
story
and
sat
staring
coolly
in
front
of
him
when
it
was
ended
i
have
no
murders
to
tell
of
but
joys
and
sufferings
and
love
and
love
is
no
less
violent
and
perilous
than
murder
green
in
all
the
woods
now
i
thought
to
myself
this
morning
as
i
dressed
the
snow
is
melting
on
the
hills
and
everywhere
the
cattle
in
their
sheds
are
eager
and
anxious
to
be
out
in
houses
and
cottages
the
windows
are
opened
wide
i
open
my
shirt
and
let
the
wind
blow
in
upon
me
and
i
mark
how
i
grow
starstruck
and
uncontrollable
within
ah
for
a
moment
it
is
all
as
years
ago
when
i
was
young
and
a
wilder
spirit
than
now
and
i
think
to
myself
maybe
there
a
tract
of
woodland
somewhere
east
or
west
of
this
where
an
old
man
can
find
himself
as
well
bested
as
a
young
i
will
go
and
look
for
it
rain
and
sun
and
wind
by
turns
i
have
been
many
days
on
the
road
already
too
cold
yet
to
lie
out
in
the
open
at
night
but
there
is
always
shelter
to
be
had
at
farmsteads
by
the
way
one
man
thinks
it
strange
that
i
should
go
tramping
about
like
this
for
nothing
he
takes
me
no
doubt
for
somebody
in
disguise
just
trying
to
be
original
like
wergeland
footnote
a
norwegian
poet
the
man
knows
nothing
of
my
plans
how
i
am
on
my
way
to
a
place
i
know
where
live
some
people
i
have
a
fancy
to
see
again
but
he
is
a
sensible
fellow
enough
and
involuntarily
i
nod
as
if
to
agree
there
is
something
in
what
he
says
there
a
theatrical
touch
in
most
of
us
that
makes
us
feel
flattered
at
being
taken
for
more
than
we
are
then
up
come
his
wife
and
daughter
good
ordinary
souls
and
carry
all
away
with
their
kindly
gossip
no
beggar
they
say
be
paid
for
his
supper
and
all
and
at
last
i
turn
crafty
and
cowardly
and
say
never
a
word
and
let
the
man
lay
more
to
my
charge
and
still
never
a
word
and
we
three
hearty
souls
outwin
his
reasoning
sense
and
he
has
to
explain
he
was
only
jesting
all
the
time
surely
we
could
see
that
i
stayed
a
night
and
a
day
there
and
greased
my
shoes
with
extra
care
and
mended
my
clothes
but
then
the
man
begins
to
suspect
once
more
there
be
a
handsome
present
for
that
girl
of
mine
when
you
leave
i
know
says
he
i
made
as
if
his
words
had
no
effect
and
answered
with
a
laugh
you
think
so
yes
says
he
and
then
when
you
gone
we
sit
thinking
you
must
have
been
somebody
grand
after
a
detestable
fellow
this
i
did
the
only
thing
i
could
ignored
his
sarcasm
and
asked
for
work
i
liked
the
place
i
said
and
he
need
of
help
i
could
turn
my
hand
to
anything
now
in
the
busy
time
you
a
fool
said
he
and
the
sooner
you
off
the
place
the
better
i
be
clearly
he
had
taken
a
dislike
to
me
and
there
was
none
of
the
womenfolk
at
hand
to
take
my
part
i
looked
at
the
man
at
a
loss
to
understand
what
was
in
his
mind
his
glance
was
steady
it
struck
me
suddenly
that
i
had
never
seen
such
wisdom
in
the
eyes
of
man
or
woman
but
he
carried
his
too
far
and
made
a
false
step
he
asked
what
shall
we
say
your
name
was
no
need
to
say
anything
at
all
i
answered
a
wandering
eilert
sundt
he
suggested
and
i
entered
into
the
jest
and
answered
yes
why
not
but
at
that
he
fired
up
and
snapped
out
sharply
then
i
sorry
for
fru
sundt
that
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
in
return
and
said
wrong
there
my
good
man
i
am
not
and
i
turned
to
go
but
with
an
unnatural
readiness
he
called
after
me
is
you
that
wrong
i
meant
for
the
mother
that
bore
a
little
way
down
the
road
i
turned
and
saw
how
his
wife
and
daughter
took
him
up
and
i
thought
to
myself
no
is
not
all
roses
when
one
goes
at
the
next
place
i
came
to
i
learned
that
he
had
been
with
the
army
as
then
he
went
mad
over
a
lawsuit
he
lost
and
was
shut
up
in
an
asylum
for
some
time
now
in
the
spring
his
trouble
broke
out
again
perhaps
it
was
my
coming
that
had
given
the
final
touch
but
the
lightning
insight
in
his
eyes
at
the
moment
when
the
madness
came
upon
him
i
think
of
him
now
and
again
he
was
a
lesson
to
me
is
none
so
easy
to
judge
of
men
who
are
wise
or
mad
and
god
preserve
us
all
from
being
known
for
what
we
are
that
day
i
passed
by
a
house
where
a
lad
sat
on
the
doorstep
playing
a
he
was
no
musician
to
speak
of
but
a
cheerful
soul
he
must
surely
be
to
sit
there
playing
to
himself
like
that
i
would
not
disturb
him
but
simply
raised
one
hand
to
my
cap
and
stood
a
little
distance
off
he
took
no
notice
of
me
only
wiped
his
and
went
on
playing
this
went
on
for
some
time
then
at
last
waiting
till
he
stopped
to
wipe
his
instrument
again
i
coughed
that
you
ingeborg
he
called
out
i
thought
he
must
be
speaking
to
someone
in
the
house
behind
him
and
made
no
answer
you
there
i
mean
he
said
again
i
was
confused
at
this
ca
you
see
me
i
said
he
did
not
answer
but
fumbled
with
his
hands
to
either
side
as
if
trying
to
get
up
and
i
realized
that
he
was
blind
sit
still
do
be
afraid
of
me
i
said
and
set
myself
down
beside
him
we
fell
into
talk
been
blind
since
he
was
fourteen
it
seemed
he
would
be
eighteen
now
and
a
big
strong
fellow
he
was
with
a
thick
growth
of
down
on
his
chin
and
thank
heaven
he
said
his
health
was
good
but
his
eyesight
i
asked
could
he
remember
what
the
world
looked
like
yes
indeed
there
were
many
pleasant
things
he
could
remember
from
the
time
when
he
could
see
he
was
happy
and
content
enough
he
was
going
in
to
christiania
this
spring
to
have
an
operation
then
perhaps
he
might
at
least
be
able
to
see
well
enough
to
walk
ay
all
would
be
well
in
time
no
doubt
he
was
looked
as
if
he
ate
a
lot
was
stout
and
strong
as
a
beast
but
there
was
something
something
of
the
idiot
about
him
his
acceptance
of
his
fate
was
too
unreasonable
to
be
hopeful
in
that
way
implies
a
certain
foolishness
i
thought
to
myself
a
man
must
be
lacking
in
sense
to
some
degree
if
he
can
go
ahead
feeling
always
content
with
life
and
even
reckoning
to
get
something
new
some
good
out
of
it
into
the
bargain
but
i
was
in
the
mood
to
learn
something
from
all
i
chanced
on
in
my
wandering
even
this
poor
creature
on
his
doorstep
made
me
the
wiser
by
one
little
thing
how
was
it
he
could
mistake
me
for
a
woman
the
woman
ingeborg
he
had
called
by
name
i
must
have
walked
up
too
quietly
i
had
forgotten
the
plodding
gait
my
shoes
were
too
light
i
had
lived
too
luxuriously
these
years
past
i
must
work
my
way
back
to
the
peasant
again
three
more
days
now
to
the
goal
my
curious
fancy
had
set
before
me
to
øvrebø
to
captain
falkenberg
it
was
an
opportune
time
to
walk
up
there
just
now
and
ask
for
work
there
would
be
plenty
to
do
on
a
big
place
like
that
in
the
spring
six
years
since
i
was
there
last
time
had
passed
and
for
the
last
few
weeks
i
had
been
letting
my
beard
grow
so
that
none
should
recognize
me
now
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
week
i
must
arrange
to
get
there
on
the
saturday
evening
then
the
captain
would
let
me
stay
over
the
sunday
while
he
thought
about
taking
me
on
on
monday
he
would
come
and
say
yes
or
no
strangely
enough
i
felt
no
excitement
at
the
thought
of
what
was
to
come
nothing
of
unrest
no
calmly
and
comfortably
i
took
my
way
by
farmstead
wood
and
meadow
i
thought
to
myself
how
i
had
once
years
ago
spent
some
adventurous
weeks
at
that
same
øvrebø
even
to
being
in
love
with
fruen
herself
with
fru
lovise
ay
that
i
was
she
had
fair
hair
and
grey
dark
eyes
like
a
young
girl
she
was
six
years
gone
ay
so
long
it
is
ago
would
she
be
greatly
changed
time
has
had
its
wear
on
me
i
am
grown
dull
and
faded
and
indifferent
i
look
upon
a
woman
now
as
literature
no
more
it
has
come
to
the
end
well
and
what
then
everything
comes
to
an
end
when
first
i
entered
on
this
stage
i
had
a
feeling
as
if
i
had
lost
something
as
if
i
had
been
favoured
by
the
caresses
of
a
pickpocket
then
i
set
to
and
felt
myself
about
to
see
if
i
could
bear
myself
after
this
if
i
could
endure
myself
as
i
was
now
oh
well
yes
why
not
not
the
same
as
before
of
course
but
it
all
passed
off
so
noiselessly
but
peacefully
but
surely
everything
comes
to
an
end
in
old
age
one
takes
no
real
part
in
life
but
keeps
oneself
on
memories
we
are
like
letters
that
have
been
delivered
we
are
no
longer
on
the
way
we
have
arrived
it
is
only
a
question
whether
we
have
whirled
up
joys
and
sorrows
out
of
what
was
in
us
or
have
made
no
impression
at
all
thanks
be
for
life
it
was
good
to
live
but
woman
she
was
as
the
wise
aforetime
knew
infinitely
poor
in
mind
but
rich
in
irresponsibility
in
vanity
in
wantonness
like
a
child
in
many
ways
but
with
nothing
of
its
innocence
i
stand
by
the
where
the
road
turns
off
to
øvrebø
there
is
no
emotion
in
me
the
day
lies
broad
and
bright
over
meadow
and
woods
here
and
there
is
ploughing
and
harrowing
in
the
fields
but
all
moves
slowly
hardly
seems
to
move
at
all
for
it
is
full
noon
and
a
blazing
sun
i
walk
a
little
way
on
beyond
the
post
dragging
out
the
time
before
going
up
to
the
house
after
an
hour
i
go
into
the
woods
and
wander
about
there
for
a
while
there
are
berries
in
flower
and
a
scent
of
little
green
leaves
a
crowd
of
thrushes
go
chasing
a
crow
across
the
sky
making
a
great
like
a
clattering
confusion
of
faulty
castanets
i
lie
down
on
my
back
with
my
sack
under
my
head
and
drop
off
to
sleep
a
little
after
i
wake
again
and
walk
over
to
the
nearest
ploughman
i
want
to
find
out
something
about
the
falkenbergs
if
they
are
still
there
and
all
well
the
man
answers
cautiously
he
stands
blinking
with
his
little
crafty
eyes
and
says
all
depends
if
captain
at
is
he
often
away
then
nay
he
be
at
has
he
got
the
field
work
done
the
man
smiled
nay
i
doubt
it
not
finished
are
there
hands
enough
to
the
place
that
more
than
i
can
say
yes
i
doubt
there
hands
enough
and
the
field
work
done
leastways
the
manure
all
carted
the
man
clicks
to
his
horses
and
goes
on
ploughing
i
walked
on
beside
him
there
was
not
much
to
be
got
out
of
him
next
time
the
horses
stopped
for
a
breathing
space
i
worried
out
of
him
a
few
more
contradictions
as
to
the
family
at
øvrebø
the
captain
it
seemed
was
away
on
manoeuvres
all
through
the
summer
and
fruen
was
at
home
alone
yes
they
had
always
a
heap
of
visitors
of
course
but
the
captain
was
away
that
is
to
say
not
because
he
wanted
to
he
liked
best
to
stay
at
home
by
all
accounts
but
of
course
he
his
duty
as
well
no
no
children
as
yet
did
look
as
if
fruen
was
like
to
have
any
what
was
i
talking
about
they
might
have
children
yet
of
course
any
amount
of
them
for
that
on
again
we
plough
on
to
the
next
stop
i
am
anxious
not
to
arrive
at
an
awkward
time
and
ask
the
man
therefore
if
he
thinks
there
would
be
visitors
or
anything
of
that
sort
up
at
the
house
today
no
he
thought
not
they
parties
and
visitors
now
and
again
but
ay
and
music
and
playing
and
fine
as
often
as
could
be
but
and
well
they
might
for
that
matter
seeing
they
were
fine
folks
and
rich
and
as
they
were
he
was
a
torment
was
that
ploughman
i
tried
to
find
out
something
about
another
falkenberg
who
could
tune
pianos
at
a
pinch
on
this
the
ploughman
information
was
more
definite
lars
ay
he
was
here
know
him
why
of
course
he
knew
lars
well
enough
he
finished
with
service
at
øvrebø
but
the
captain
had
given
him
a
clearing
of
land
to
live
on
he
married
emma
that
was
maid
at
the
house
and
they
a
couple
of
children
decent
hardworking
folk
with
feed
for
two
cows
already
out
of
their
clearing
here
the
furrow
ended
and
the
man
turned
his
team
about
i
thanked
him
and
went
on
my
way
when
i
came
to
the
house
i
recognized
all
the
buildings
they
wanted
painting
the
flagstaff
i
had
helped
to
raise
six
years
before
it
stood
there
still
but
there
was
no
cord
to
it
and
the
knob
at
the
top
was
gone
well
here
i
was
and
that
was
four
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
of
april
old
folk
have
a
memory
for
dates
i
it
turned
out
otherwise
than
i
had
thought
captain
falkenberg
came
out
heard
what
i
had
to
say
and
answered
no
on
the
spot
he
had
all
the
hands
he
wanted
and
the
field
work
was
all
but
done
good
might
i
go
over
to
the
men
room
and
sit
down
and
rest
a
while
certainly
no
invitation
to
stay
over
sunday
the
captain
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
indoors
again
he
looked
as
if
he
had
only
just
got
out
of
bed
for
he
was
wearing
a
tucked
into
his
trousers
and
had
no
waistcoat
on
only
a
jacket
flung
on
loosely
and
left
unbuttoned
he
was
going
grey
about
the
ears
and
his
beard
as
well
i
sat
down
in
the
men
quarters
and
waited
till
the
farmhands
came
in
for
their
afternoon
meal
there
were
only
two
of
them
the
foreman
and
another
i
got
into
talk
with
them
and
it
appeared
the
captain
had
made
a
mistake
in
saying
the
field
work
was
all
but
done
well
was
his
own
affair
i
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
i
was
looking
for
a
place
and
as
for
being
used
to
the
work
i
showed
them
the
fine
recommendation
i
had
got
from
the
lensmand
at
hersæt
years
ago
when
the
men
went
out
again
i
took
my
sack
and
walked
out
with
them
ready
to
go
on
my
way
i
peeped
in
at
the
stables
and
saw
a
surprising
number
of
horses
looked
at
the
cowshed
at
the
fowls
and
the
pigs
i
noticed
that
there
was
dung
in
the
pit
from
the
year
before
that
had
not
been
carted
out
yet
i
asked
how
that
could
be
well
what
are
we
to
do
answered
the
foreman
i
looked
to
it
from
the
end
of
the
winter
up
till
now
and
nobody
but
myself
on
the
place
now
there
two
of
us
at
least
in
a
sort
of
way
but
now
there
all
the
ploughing
and
harrowing
to
be
his
affair
i
bade
him
farewell
and
went
on
my
way
i
was
going
to
my
good
friend
lars
falkenberg
but
i
did
not
tell
them
so
there
are
some
new
little
buildings
far
up
in
the
wood
i
can
see
and
that
i
take
to
be
the
clearing
but
the
man
i
had
just
left
must
have
been
inwardly
stirred
by
the
thought
of
getting
an
extra
hand
to
help
with
the
work
i
saw
him
tramp
across
the
courtyard
and
up
to
the
house
as
i
went
off
i
had
gone
but
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
when
he
comes
hurrying
after
me
to
say
i
am
taken
on
after
all
he
had
spoken
to
the
captain
and
got
leave
to
take
me
on
himself
there
be
nothing
to
do
now
till
monday
but
come
in
and
have
something
to
he
is
a
good
fellow
this
goes
with
me
up
to
the
kitchen
and
tells
them
there
here
a
new
man
come
to
work
on
the
place
see
he
gets
something
to
a
strange
cook
and
strange
maids
i
get
my
food
and
go
out
again
no
sign
of
master
or
mistress
anywhere
but
i
can
not
sit
idle
in
the
men
room
all
the
evening
i
walk
up
to
the
field
and
talk
to
my
two
nils
the
foreman
is
from
a
farm
a
little
north
of
here
but
not
being
the
eldest
son
and
having
no
farm
of
his
own
to
run
he
has
been
sensible
enough
to
take
service
here
at
øvrebø
for
the
time
being
and
indeed
he
might
have
done
worse
the
captain
himself
was
not
paying
more
and
more
attention
to
his
land
rather
perhaps
less
and
less
and
he
was
away
so
much
that
the
man
had
to
use
his
own
judgment
many
a
time
this
last
autumn
for
instance
he
has
turned
up
a
big
stretch
of
waste
land
that
he
is
going
to
sow
he
points
out
over
the
ground
showing
where
he
ploughed
and
what
to
lie
over
see
that
bit
there
how
well
it
coming
it
is
good
to
hear
how
well
this
young
man
knows
his
work
i
find
a
pleasure
in
his
sensible
talk
he
has
been
to
one
of
the
state
schools
too
and
learned
how
to
keep
accounts
of
stock
entering
loads
of
hay
in
one
column
and
the
birth
dates
of
the
calves
in
another
his
affair
in
the
old
days
a
peasant
kept
such
matters
in
his
head
and
the
womenfolk
knew
to
a
day
when
each
of
their
twenty
or
fifty
cow
was
due
to
calve
but
he
is
a
smart
young
fellow
nevertheless
and
not
afraid
of
work
only
a
little
soured
and
spoiled
of
late
by
having
more
on
his
hands
than
a
man
could
do
it
was
plain
to
see
how
he
brightened
up
now
he
had
got
a
man
to
help
with
the
work
and
he
settles
there
and
then
that
i
am
to
start
on
monday
with
the
harrow
horse
carting
out
manure
the
lad
to
take
one
of
the
captain
carriage
horses
for
the
harrow
he
himself
would
stick
to
the
ploughing
ay
we
would
get
our
sowing
done
this
year
sunday
i
must
be
careful
not
to
show
any
former
knowledge
of
things
about
the
place
here
as
for
instance
how
far
the
captain
timber
runs
or
where
the
various
and
buildings
are
or
the
well
or
the
roads
i
took
some
time
getting
things
ready
for
tomorrow
greased
the
wheels
of
the
cart
and
did
up
the
harness
and
gave
the
horse
an
extra
turn
in
the
afternoon
i
went
for
a
four
or
five
hours
ramble
through
the
woods
passed
by
lars
falkenberg
place
without
going
in
and
came
right
out
to
where
the
captain
land
joined
that
of
the
neighbouring
village
before
i
turned
back
i
was
surprised
to
see
the
mass
of
timber
that
had
been
cut
when
i
got
back
nils
asked
did
you
hear
them
singing
and
carrying
on
last
night
yes
what
was
it
visitors
said
he
with
a
laugh
visitors
yes
there
were
always
visitors
at
øvrebø
just
now
there
was
an
extremely
fat
but
sprightly
man
among
them
he
wore
his
moustache
turned
up
at
the
ends
and
was
a
captain
in
the
same
arm
of
the
service
as
the
master
i
saw
him
and
the
other
guests
come
lounging
out
of
the
house
in
the
course
of
the
evening
there
was
a
man
they
called
ingeniør
footnote
engineer
men
are
frequently
addressed
and
referred
to
by
the
title
of
their
occupation
with
or
without
adding
the
name
he
was
young
a
little
over
twenty
fairly
tall
and
clean
shaven
and
there
was
elisabet
from
the
vicarage
i
remember
elisabet
very
well
and
recognized
her
now
at
once
for
all
she
was
six
years
older
and
more
mature
little
elisabet
of
the
old
days
was
no
longer
a
girl
her
breast
stood
out
so
and
gave
an
impression
of
exaggerated
health
i
learned
she
is
married
she
took
erik
after
all
a
farmer
son
she
had
been
fond
of
as
a
child
she
was
still
friendly
with
fru
falkenberg
and
often
came
to
stay
but
her
husband
never
came
with
her
elisabet
is
standing
by
the
flagstaff
and
captain
falkenberg
comes
out
they
talk
a
little
and
are
occupied
with
their
own
affairs
the
captain
glances
round
every
time
he
speaks
possibly
he
is
not
talking
of
trifles
but
of
something
he
must
needs
be
careful
with
then
comes
the
other
captain
the
fat
and
jovial
one
we
can
hear
his
laugh
right
over
in
the
servants
quarters
he
calls
out
to
captain
falkenberg
to
come
along
but
gets
back
only
a
curt
answer
a
few
stone
steps
lead
down
to
the
lilac
shrubbery
the
captain
goes
down
there
now
a
maid
following
after
with
wine
and
glasses
last
of
all
comes
the
engineer
nils
bursts
out
laughing
oh
that
captain
look
at
him
what
his
name
they
all
call
him
bror
footnote
brother
not
so
much
a
nickname
as
a
general
term
of
jovial
familiarity
it
was
the
same
last
year
as
well
i
do
know
his
proper
and
the
engineer
his
name
lassen
so
i
heard
he
only
been
here
once
before
in
my
then
came
fru
falkenberg
out
on
the
steps
she
stopped
for
a
moment
and
glanced
over
at
the
two
by
the
flagstaff
her
figure
is
slight
and
pretty
as
ever
but
her
face
seems
looser
as
if
she
had
been
stouter
once
and
since
grown
thin
she
goes
down
to
the
shrubbery
after
the
others
and
i
recognize
her
walk
again
light
and
firm
as
of
old
but
little
wonder
if
time
has
taken
something
of
her
looks
in
all
those
years
more
people
come
out
from
the
house
an
elderly
lady
wearing
a
shawl
and
two
gentlemen
with
her
nils
tells
me
it
is
not
always
there
are
so
many
guests
in
the
house
at
once
but
it
was
the
captain
birthday
two
days
ago
and
two
carriage
loads
of
people
had
come
dashing
up
the
four
strange
horses
were
in
the
stables
now
now
voices
are
calling
again
for
the
couple
by
the
flagstaff
the
captain
throws
out
an
impatient
yes
but
does
not
move
now
he
brushes
a
speck
of
dust
from
elisabet
shoulder
now
looking
round
carefully
he
lays
one
hand
on
her
arm
and
tells
her
something
earnestly
says
nils
they
always
such
a
lot
to
talk
about
those
two
she
never
comes
here
but
they
go
off
for
long
walks
and
what
does
fru
falkenberg
say
to
that
i
never
heard
she
troubled
about
it
any
and
elisabet
has
she
any
children
either
ay
she
but
how
can
she
get
away
so
often
with
that
big
place
and
the
children
to
look
after
it
all
right
as
long
as
erik
mother
alive
she
can
get
away
all
she
he
went
out
as
he
spoke
leaving
me
alone
in
this
room
i
had
sat
once
working
out
the
construction
of
an
improved
timber
saw
how
earnest
i
was
about
it
all
petter
the
lay
sick
in
the
room
next
door
and
i
would
hurry
out
eagerly
whenever
i
any
hammering
to
do
and
get
it
done
outside
now
that
patent
saw
just
literature
to
me
no
more
so
the
years
deal
with
us
all
nils
comes
in
again
if
the
visitors
are
gone
tomorrow
i
take
a
couple
of
their
horses
for
the
ploughing
says
he
thinking
only
of
his
own
affairs
i
glanced
out
of
the
window
the
couple
by
the
flagstaff
have
moved
away
at
last
in
the
evening
things
grew
more
and
more
lively
down
in
the
shrubbery
the
maids
went
backwards
and
forwards
with
trays
of
food
and
drink
the
party
were
having
supper
among
the
lilacs
bror
bror
cried
one
and
another
but
bror
himself
was
loudest
of
all
a
chair
had
broken
under
his
enormous
weight
and
a
message
comes
out
to
the
servants
quarters
to
find
a
good
solid
wooden
chair
that
would
bear
him
oh
but
they
were
merry
down
in
the
shrubbery
captain
falkenberg
walked
up
now
and
again
in
front
of
the
house
to
show
he
was
still
steady
on
his
legs
and
was
keeping
a
watchful
eye
on
things
in
general
you
mark
my
words
said
nils
he
not
be
the
first
to
give
over
i
drove
for
him
last
year
and
he
was
drinking
all
the
way
but
never
a
sign
was
there
to
the
sun
went
down
it
was
growing
chilly
perhaps
in
the
garden
anyway
the
party
went
indoors
but
the
big
windows
were
thrown
wide
and
waves
of
melody
from
fru
falkenberg
piano
poured
out
after
a
while
it
changed
to
dance
tunes
jovial
captain
bror
no
doubt
was
playing
now
nice
lot
are
they
said
nils
sit
up
playing
and
dancing
all
night
and
stay
in
bed
all
day
i
going
to
turn
i
stayed
behind
looking
out
of
the
window
and
saw
my
mate
lars
falkenberg
come
walking
across
the
courtyard
and
go
up
into
the
house
he
had
been
sent
for
to
sing
to
the
company
when
he
has
sung
for
a
while
captain
bror
and
some
of
the
others
begin
to
chime
in
and
help
making
a
fine
merry
noise
between
them
after
about
an
hour
in
comes
lars
falkenberg
to
the
servants
quarters
with
a
of
spirit
in
his
pocket
for
his
trouble
seeing
no
one
but
me
a
stranger
in
the
room
he
goes
in
to
nils
in
the
bedroom
next
door
and
they
take
a
dram
together
after
a
little
they
call
to
me
to
come
in
i
am
careful
not
to
say
too
much
hoping
not
to
be
recognized
but
when
lars
gets
up
to
go
home
he
asks
me
to
go
part
of
the
way
with
him
and
then
it
appears
that
i
am
discovered
already
lars
knows
that
i
am
his
former
mate
of
the
woodcutting
days
the
captain
had
told
him
well
and
good
i
think
to
myself
then
i
no
need
to
bother
about
being
careful
any
more
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
well
pleased
at
the
way
things
had
turned
out
it
meant
that
the
captain
was
completely
indifferent
as
to
having
me
about
the
place
i
could
do
as
i
pleased
i
walked
all
the
way
home
with
lars
talking
over
old
times
and
of
his
new
place
and
of
the
people
at
øvrebø
it
seemed
that
the
captain
was
not
looked
up
to
with
the
same
respect
as
before
he
was
no
longer
the
spokesman
of
the
district
and
neighbours
had
ceased
to
come
and
ask
his
help
and
advice
the
last
thing
of
any
account
he
did
was
to
have
the
carriage
drive
altered
down
to
the
high
road
but
that
was
five
years
ago
the
buildings
needed
painting
but
he
had
put
it
off
and
never
had
it
done
the
road
across
the
estate
was
in
disrepair
and
he
had
felled
too
much
timber
by
far
drink
oh
so
folk
said
no
doubt
but
it
could
be
fairly
said
he
drank
not
that
way
devil
take
the
gossiping
fools
he
drank
a
little
and
now
and
again
he
would
drive
off
somewhere
and
stay
away
for
a
bit
but
when
he
did
come
home
again
things
never
seemed
to
go
well
with
him
and
that
was
the
pity
of
it
an
evil
spirit
seemed
to
have
got
hold
of
him
said
lars
and
fruen
fruen
she
went
about
the
house
as
before
and
played
on
her
piano
and
was
as
pretty
and
neat
as
ever
any
one
could
wish
and
they
keep
open
house
with
folk
for
ever
coming
and
going
but
taxes
and
charges
on
this
and
that
mount
up
and
it
costs
a
deal
to
keep
up
the
place
with
all
the
big
buildings
to
be
seen
to
but
it
is
a
sin
and
a
shame
for
the
captain
and
fruen
as
well
to
be
so
of
each
other
never
think
if
they
do
say
a
word
to
each
other
it
looking
to
the
other
side
all
the
time
and
hardly
opening
their
lips
they
barely
speak
at
all
except
to
other
people
month
after
month
the
same
and
all
summer
the
captain
out
on
manoeuvres
and
never
comes
home
to
see
how
his
wife
and
the
place
are
getting
on
no
they
no
children
the
trouble
says
lars
emma
comes
out
and
joins
us
she
looks
well
and
handsome
still
and
i
tell
her
so
emma
says
lars
ay
well
she
none
so
bad
but
she
for
ever
having
children
the
wretch
and
pouring
out
a
drink
from
his
he
forces
her
to
drink
it
off
now
emma
presses
us
to
come
in
we
might
just
as
well
be
sitting
down
indoors
as
standing
about
out
here
oh
it
summer
now
says
lars
evidently
none
so
anxious
to
have
me
in
then
when
i
set
off
for
home
he
walks
down
again
with
me
a
bit
of
the
way
showing
me
where
he
dug
and
drained
and
fenced
about
his
bit
of
land
small
as
it
is
he
has
made
good
and
sensible
use
of
it
i
find
a
strange
sense
of
pleasure
coming
over
me
as
i
look
at
this
cosy
homestead
in
the
woods
there
is
a
faint
soughing
of
the
wind
in
the
forest
behind
close
up
to
the
house
are
foliage
trees
and
the
aspens
rustle
like
silk
i
walk
back
home
night
is
deepening
all
the
birds
are
silent
the
air
calm
and
warm
in
a
soft
bluish
gloom
let
us
be
young
it
is
a
man
voice
loud
and
bright
from
behind
the
lilacs
let
go
and
dance
or
do
something
have
you
forgotten
what
you
were
like
last
year
answers
fru
falkenberg
you
were
nice
and
young
then
and
never
said
such
no
i
never
said
such
things
to
think
you
should
remember
that
but
you
scolded
me
one
evening
last
year
too
i
said
how
beautiful
you
were
that
evening
and
you
said
no
you
were
beautiful
any
more
and
you
called
me
a
child
and
told
me
not
to
drink
so
yes
so
i
did
says
fru
falkenberg
with
a
laugh
so
you
did
yes
but
as
to
your
being
beautiful
or
not
surely
i
ought
to
know
when
i
was
sitting
looking
at
you
all
the
time
oh
you
child
and
this
evening
you
lovelier
there
some
one
coming
two
figures
rise
up
suddenly
behind
the
lilacs
fruen
and
the
young
engineer
seeing
it
is
only
me
they
breathe
more
easily
again
and
go
on
talking
as
if
i
did
not
exist
and
mark
how
strange
is
human
feeling
i
had
been
wishing
all
along
to
be
ignored
and
left
in
peace
yet
now
it
hurt
me
to
see
these
two
making
so
little
account
of
me
my
hair
and
beard
are
turning
grey
i
thought
to
myself
should
they
not
respect
me
at
least
for
that
yes
you
lovelier
still
tonight
says
the
man
again
i
come
up
alongside
them
touching
my
cap
carelessly
and
pass
on
i
tell
you
this
much
you
gain
nothing
by
it
says
fruen
and
then
here
you
dropped
something
she
calls
to
me
dropped
something
my
handkerchief
lay
on
the
path
i
had
dropped
it
on
purpose
i
turned
round
now
and
picked
it
up
said
thank
you
and
walked
on
you
very
quick
to
notice
things
of
no
account
says
the
engineer
a
lout
rag
come
let
go
and
sit
in
the
it
shut
up
at
night
says
fruen
i
dare
say
there
somebody
in
after
that
i
heard
no
more
my
bedroom
is
up
in
the
loft
in
the
servants
quarters
and
the
one
open
window
looks
out
to
the
shrubbery
when
i
come
up
i
can
still
hear
voices
down
there
among
the
bushes
but
can
not
make
out
what
is
said
i
thought
to
myself
why
should
the
be
shut
up
at
night
and
whose
idea
could
it
be
possibly
some
very
crafty
soul
reckoning
that
if
the
door
were
always
kept
locked
it
would
be
less
risky
to
slip
inside
one
evening
in
good
company
take
out
the
key
and
stay
there
some
way
down
along
the
way
i
had
just
come
were
two
people
walking
up
captain
bror
and
the
old
lady
with
the
shawl
they
had
been
sitting
somewhere
among
the
trees
no
doubt
when
i
passed
by
and
i
fell
to
wondering
now
if
by
any
chance
i
could
have
been
talking
to
myself
as
i
walked
and
been
overheard
suddenly
i
see
the
engineer
get
up
from
behind
the
bushes
and
walk
swiftly
over
to
the
finding
it
locked
he
sets
his
shoulder
against
the
door
and
breaks
it
open
with
a
crash
come
along
there
nobody
here
he
cries
fru
falkenberg
gets
up
and
says
madman
whatever
are
you
doing
but
she
goes
towards
him
all
the
same
doing
says
he
what
else
should
i
do
love
is
glycerine
and
he
takes
her
by
the
arm
and
leads
her
in
well
is
their
affair
but
the
stout
captain
and
his
lady
are
coming
up
the
pair
in
the
will
hardly
be
aware
of
their
approach
and
fru
falkenberg
would
perhaps
find
it
far
from
agreeable
to
be
discovered
sitting
there
with
a
man
just
now
i
look
about
for
some
means
of
warning
them
here
is
an
empty
bottle
i
go
to
the
window
and
fling
it
as
hard
as
i
can
over
towards
the
there
is
a
crash
bottle
and
tiles
are
broken
and
the
pieces
go
clattering
down
over
the
roof
a
cry
of
dismay
from
within
and
fru
falkenberg
rushes
out
her
companion
behind
her
still
grasping
her
dress
they
stop
for
a
moment
and
look
about
them
bror
cries
fru
falkenberg
and
sets
off
at
a
run
down
the
shrubbery
no
do
come
she
calls
back
over
her
shoulder
you
i
tell
but
the
engineer
ran
after
her
all
the
same
wonderfully
young
he
was
and
all
inflexible
now
the
stout
captain
and
his
lady
come
up
and
their
talk
is
a
marvel
to
hear
love
there
is
nothing
like
it
so
it
seems
the
stout
cavalier
must
be
sixty
at
the
least
and
the
lady
with
him
say
forty
their
infatuation
was
a
sight
to
see
the
captain
speaks
and
up
to
this
evening
i
managed
to
hide
it
somehow
but
now
well
it
more
than
any
man
can
you
bewitched
me
frue
i
did
think
you
cared
so
much
really
she
answers
gently
trying
to
help
him
along
well
i
do
he
says
and
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
and
that
the
truth
when
we
were
up
in
the
woods
just
now
i
still
thought
i
could
get
through
one
more
night
and
did
say
anything
much
at
the
time
but
now
come
back
with
me
say
you
will
she
shook
her
head
no
oh
i
love
to
give
you
do
what
you
ah
he
exclaims
and
throwing
his
arms
about
her
stands
pressing
his
round
paunch
against
hers
there
they
stood
looking
like
two
recalcitrants
that
would
not
oh
that
captain
let
me
go
she
implored
him
he
loosened
his
hold
a
trifle
and
pressed
her
to
him
again
once
more
it
looked
as
if
both
were
resisting
come
back
up
into
the
wood
he
urged
again
and
again
oh
it
impossible
she
answered
and
then
it
all
wet
with
the
but
the
captain
was
full
of
passionate
words
full
and
frothing
over
oh
i
used
to
think
i
did
care
much
about
eyes
blue
eyes
huh
grey
eyes
huh
eyes
any
sort
of
colour
huh
but
then
you
came
with
those
brown
eyes
of
yours
they
are
brown
yes
you
burn
me
with
them
you
you
roast
me
up
to
tell
the
truth
you
not
the
first
that
said
nice
things
about
my
eyes
my
husband
now
ah
but
what
about
me
cries
the
captain
i
tell
you
frue
if
only
met
you
twenty
years
ago
i
would
have
answered
for
my
reason
come
there
no
dew
to
speak
of
up
in
the
we
better
go
indoors
i
think
she
suggests
go
in
there
not
a
corner
anywhere
indoors
where
we
can
be
oh
we
find
somewhere
she
says
well
anyhow
we
must
have
an
end
of
it
says
the
captain
decisively
and
they
go
i
asked
myself
was
it
to
warn
anybody
i
had
thrown
that
empty
bottle
at
three
in
the
morning
i
heard
nils
go
out
to
feed
the
horses
at
four
he
knocked
to
rouse
me
out
of
bed
i
did
not
grudge
him
the
honour
of
being
first
up
though
i
could
have
called
him
earlier
myself
any
hour
of
that
night
indeed
for
i
had
not
slept
is
easy
enough
to
go
without
sleep
a
night
or
two
in
this
light
fine
air
it
does
not
make
for
drowsiness
nils
sets
out
for
the
fields
driving
a
new
team
he
has
looked
over
the
visitors
horses
and
chosen
elisabet
good
heavy
in
the
leg
ii
more
visitors
arrive
and
the
goes
on
we
are
busy
measuring
ploughing
and
sowing
some
of
the
fields
are
sprouting
green
already
after
our
work
a
joy
to
see
but
we
difficulties
here
and
there
and
that
with
captain
falkenberg
himself
he
lost
all
thought
and
care
for
his
own
good
says
nils
and
indeed
an
evil
spirit
must
have
got
hold
of
him
he
was
most
of
the
time
and
seemed
to
think
of
little
else
beyond
playing
the
genial
host
for
nearly
a
week
past
he
and
his
guests
had
played
upside
down
with
day
and
night
but
what
with
the
noise
and
rioting
after
dark
the
beasts
in
stable
and
shed
could
get
no
rest
the
maids
too
were
kept
up
at
all
hours
and
what
was
more
the
young
gentlemen
would
come
over
to
their
quarters
at
night
and
sit
on
their
beds
talking
just
to
see
them
undressed
we
working
hands
had
no
part
in
this
of
course
but
many
a
time
we
felt
shamed
instead
of
proud
to
work
on
captain
falkenberg
estate
nils
got
hold
of
a
temperance
badge
and
wore
it
in
the
front
of
his
blouse
one
day
the
captain
came
out
to
me
in
the
fields
and
ordered
me
to
get
out
the
carriage
and
fetch
two
new
visitors
from
the
station
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
apparently
he
had
just
got
up
but
he
put
me
in
an
awkward
position
here
why
had
he
not
gone
to
nils
it
struck
me
that
he
was
perhaps
after
all
a
little
shy
of
nils
with
his
temperance
badge
the
captain
must
have
guessed
my
difficulty
for
he
smiled
and
said
thinking
what
nils
might
say
well
perhaps
i
better
talk
to
him
but
i
would
for
worlds
have
sent
the
captain
over
to
nils
just
then
for
nils
was
still
ploughing
with
visitors
horses
and
had
asked
me
to
give
him
warning
if
i
saw
danger
ahead
i
took
out
my
handkerchief
to
wipe
my
face
and
waved
a
little
nils
saw
it
and
slipped
his
team
at
once
what
would
he
do
now
i
wondered
but
nils
was
not
easily
dismayed
he
came
straight
in
with
his
horses
though
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
working
spell
if
only
i
could
hold
the
captain
here
a
bit
while
he
got
in
nils
realizes
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
he
is
already
unfastening
the
harness
on
the
way
suddenly
the
captain
looks
at
me
and
asks
well
have
you
lost
your
tongue
was
nils
i
answer
then
something
gone
wrong
it
looks
like
taken
the
horses
well
and
what
then
nay
i
was
only
thinking
but
there
i
stopped
devil
take
it
was
i
to
stand
there
playing
the
hypocrite
here
was
my
chance
to
put
in
a
word
for
nils
the
next
round
he
would
have
to
manage
alone
it
the
spring
season
now
i
said
and
there
green
showing
already
where
we
done
but
there
a
deal
more
to
do
yet
and
we
well
and
what
then
what
then
there
two
and
a
half
acres
here
and
nils
with
hard
on
three
acres
of
corn
land
perhaps
captain
might
give
it
another
at
that
the
captain
swung
on
his
heel
and
left
me
without
a
word
that
my
dismissal
i
thought
to
myself
but
i
walked
up
after
him
with
my
cart
and
team
ready
to
do
as
he
had
said
i
was
in
no
fear
now
about
nils
he
was
close
up
to
the
stables
by
now
the
captain
beckoned
to
him
but
without
avail
then
halt
he
cried
military
fashion
but
nils
was
deaf
when
we
reached
the
stables
the
horses
were
back
in
their
places
already
the
captain
was
stiff
and
stern
as
ever
but
i
fancied
he
had
been
thinking
matters
over
a
little
on
the
way
what
have
you
brought
the
horses
in
for
now
he
asked
plough
was
working
loose
answered
nils
i
brought
them
in
just
while
i
setting
it
to
rights
again
it
wo
take
very
the
captain
raps
out
his
order
i
want
a
man
to
drive
to
the
nils
glances
at
me
and
says
half
to
himself
h
so
that
it
a
nice
time
for
that
sort
of
what
that
you
muttering
about
there
two
of
us
and
a
lad
says
nils
for
the
season
work
this
spring
is
none
so
much
as
leaves
any
to
but
the
captain
must
have
had
some
inkling
as
to
the
two
brown
horses
nils
had
been
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
in
he
goes
round
patting
the
animals
in
turn
to
see
which
of
them
are
warm
then
he
comes
back
to
us
wiping
his
fingers
with
his
handkerchief
do
you
go
ploughing
with
other
people
horses
nils
pause
i
not
have
it
here
you
understand
h
no
says
nils
submissively
then
suddenly
he
flares
up
more
need
of
horses
this
spring
than
any
season
ever
at
øvrebø
taking
up
more
ground
than
ever
before
and
here
were
these
strange
cattle
standing
here
day
after
day
eating
and
eating
and
doing
never
so
much
as
the
worth
of
the
water
they
drank
so
i
took
them
out
for
a
bit
of
a
spell
now
and
then
just
enough
to
keep
them
in
i
have
no
more
of
it
you
hear
what
i
say
repeated
the
captain
shortly
pause
did
you
say
one
of
the
captain
plough
horses
was
ailing
yesterday
i
put
in
nils
was
quick
to
seize
his
chance
ay
so
it
was
standing
all
in
its
box
i
could
have
taken
it
out
the
captain
looked
me
coldly
up
and
down
what
are
you
standing
here
for
he
asked
sharply
captain
said
i
was
to
drive
to
the
well
then
be
off
and
get
but
nils
took
him
up
on
the
instant
that
ca
be
bravo
nils
said
i
to
myself
the
lad
was
thoroughly
in
the
right
and
he
looked
it
sturdily
holding
his
own
and
as
for
the
horses
our
own
had
been
sorely
overdone
with
the
long
season
work
and
the
strange
cattle
stood
there
eating
their
heads
off
and
spoiling
for
want
of
exercise
ca
be
done
said
the
captain
astounded
what
do
you
mean
if
captain
takes
away
the
help
i
got
then
i
finished
here
that
all
says
nils
the
captain
walked
to
the
stable
door
and
looked
out
biting
his
moustache
and
thinking
hard
then
he
asked
over
his
shoulder
and
you
ca
spare
the
lad
either
no
said
nils
he
the
harrowing
to
this
was
our
first
real
encounter
with
the
captain
and
we
had
our
way
there
were
some
little
troubles
again
later
on
but
he
soon
gave
in
i
want
a
case
fetched
from
the
station
he
said
one
day
can
the
boy
go
in
for
it
the
boy
as
ill
to
spare
as
a
man
for
us
now
said
nils
if
he
to
drive
in
to
the
station
now
he
wo
be
back
till
late
tomorrow
a
day
and
a
half
bravo
i
said
to
myself
again
nils
had
spoken
to
me
before
about
that
case
at
the
station
it
was
a
new
consignment
of
liquor
the
maids
had
heard
about
it
there
was
some
more
talk
this
way
and
that
the
captain
frowned
he
had
never
known
a
busy
season
last
so
long
before
nils
lost
his
temper
and
said
at
last
if
you
take
the
boy
off
his
field
work
then
i
and
then
he
did
as
he
and
i
had
agreed
beforehand
and
asked
me
straight
out
will
you
go
too
yes
said
i
at
that
the
captain
gave
way
and
said
with
a
smile
conspiracy
i
see
but
i
do
mind
saying
you
right
in
a
way
and
you
good
fellows
to
but
the
captain
saw
but
little
of
our
work
and
little
pleasure
it
gave
him
he
looked
out
now
and
again
no
doubt
over
his
fields
and
saw
how
much
was
ploughed
and
sown
but
that
was
all
but
we
worked
our
hardest
and
all
for
the
good
of
our
master
that
was
our
way
ay
that
was
our
way
no
doubt
but
maybe
now
and
again
we
might
have
just
a
thought
of
question
as
to
that
zeal
of
ours
whether
it
was
so
noble
after
all
nils
was
a
man
from
the
village
who
was
anxious
to
get
his
field
work
done
at
least
as
quickly
as
any
of
his
neighbours
his
honour
was
at
stake
and
i
followed
him
ay
even
when
he
put
on
that
temperance
badge
it
was
perhaps
as
much
as
anything
to
get
the
captain
sober
enough
to
see
the
fine
work
we
had
done
and
here
again
i
was
with
him
moreover
i
had
perhaps
a
hope
that
fruen
that
fru
falkenberg
at
least
might
understand
what
good
souls
we
were
i
doubt
i
was
no
better
than
to
reckon
so
the
first
time
i
saw
fru
falkenberg
close
to
was
one
afternoon
as
i
was
going
out
of
the
kitchen
she
came
walking
across
the
courtyard
a
slender
bareheaded
figure
i
raised
my
cap
and
looked
at
her
her
face
was
strangely
young
and
innocent
to
see
and
with
perfect
indifference
she
answered
my
and
passed
on
it
could
not
be
all
over
for
good
between
the
captain
and
his
wife
i
based
this
view
upon
the
following
grounds
ragnhild
the
was
her
mistress
friend
and
trusted
spy
she
noted
things
on
fruen
behalf
went
last
to
bed
listened
on
the
stairs
made
a
few
swift
noiseless
steps
when
she
was
outside
and
somebody
called
she
was
a
handsome
girl
with
very
bright
eyes
and
fine
and
into
the
bargain
one
evening
i
came
on
her
just
by
the
where
she
stood
sniffing
at
the
lilacs
she
started
as
i
came
up
pointed
warningly
towards
the
and
ran
off
with
her
tongue
between
her
teeth
the
captain
was
aware
of
ragnhild
doings
and
once
said
to
his
wife
so
all
might
hear
he
was
drunk
no
doubt
and
annoyed
at
something
or
other
that
ragnhild
an
underhanded
creature
i
be
glad
to
be
rid
of
fruen
answered
it
not
the
first
time
you
wanted
to
get
ragnhild
out
of
the
way
heaven
knows
what
for
she
the
best
maid
we
ever
for
that
particular
purpose
i
dare
say
he
retorted
this
set
me
thinking
fruen
was
perhaps
crafty
enough
to
keep
this
girl
spying
simply
to
make
it
seem
as
if
she
cared
at
all
what
her
husband
did
then
people
could
imagine
that
fruen
poor
thing
went
about
secretly
longing
for
him
and
being
constantly
disappointed
and
wronged
and
then
of
course
who
could
blame
her
if
she
did
the
like
in
return
and
went
her
own
way
heaven
knows
if
that
was
the
way
of
it
one
day
later
on
the
captain
changed
his
tactics
he
had
not
managed
to
free
himself
from
ragnhild
watchfulness
she
was
still
there
to
be
close
at
hand
when
he
was
talking
to
elisabet
in
some
corner
or
making
towards
the
late
in
the
evening
to
sit
there
with
some
one
undisturbed
so
he
tried
another
way
and
began
making
himself
agreeable
to
that
same
ragnhild
oho
was
a
woman
wit
no
doubt
was
elisabet
had
put
him
up
to
that
we
were
sitting
at
the
long
in
the
kitchen
nils
and
i
and
the
lad
fruen
was
there
and
the
maids
were
busy
with
their
own
work
then
in
comes
the
captain
from
the
house
with
a
brush
in
his
hand
give
my
coat
a
bit
of
a
brush
mind
says
he
to
ragnhild
she
obeyed
when
she
had
finished
he
thanked
her
saying
thank
you
my
fruen
looked
a
little
surprised
and
a
moment
after
sent
her
maid
upstairs
for
something
the
captain
looked
after
her
as
she
went
and
said
wonderfully
bright
eyes
that
girl
has
to
be
i
glanced
across
at
fruen
her
eyes
were
blazing
her
cheeks
flushed
as
she
moved
to
leave
the
room
but
in
the
doorway
she
turned
and
now
her
face
was
pale
she
seemed
to
have
formed
her
resolution
already
speaking
over
her
shoulder
she
said
to
her
husband
i
should
be
surprised
if
ragnhild
eyes
were
a
little
too
eh
says
the
captain
in
surprise
yes
says
fruen
with
a
slight
laugh
nodding
over
towards
the
table
where
we
sat
she
getting
a
little
too
friendly
with
the
men
out
silence
so
perhaps
she
better
go
fruen
went
on
it
was
incomparable
audacity
on
fruen
part
of
course
to
say
such
a
thing
to
our
face
but
we
could
not
protest
we
saw
she
was
only
using
us
to
serve
her
need
when
we
got
outside
nils
said
angrily
i
not
sure
but
i
better
go
back
and
say
a
word
or
two
myself
about
but
i
dissuaded
him
saying
it
was
not
worth
troubling
about
a
few
days
passed
again
the
captain
found
an
opportunity
of
paying
barefaced
compliments
to
ragnhild
with
a
figure
like
yours
he
said
and
the
tone
of
everything
about
the
house
now
badly
changed
from
of
old
gone
down
grown
poorer
year
by
year
no
doubt
drunken
guests
doing
their
share
to
help
and
idleness
and
indifference
and
childlessness
for
the
rest
in
the
evening
ragnhild
came
to
me
and
told
me
she
was
given
notice
fruen
had
made
some
reference
to
me
and
that
was
all
once
more
a
piece
of
underhand
work
fruen
knew
well
i
should
not
be
long
on
the
place
why
not
make
me
the
scapegoat
she
was
determined
to
upset
her
husband
calculations
that
was
the
matter
ragnhild
by
the
way
took
it
to
heart
a
good
deal
and
sobbed
and
dabbed
her
eyes
but
after
a
while
she
comforted
herself
with
the
thought
that
as
soon
as
i
was
gone
fruen
would
take
back
her
dismissal
and
let
her
stay
i
for
my
part
was
inwardly
sure
that
fruen
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
yes
the
captain
and
elisabet
might
be
content
the
troublesome
was
to
be
sent
packing
surely
enough
but
who
was
to
know
i
might
be
out
in
my
reckoning
after
all
new
happenings
set
me
questioning
anew
ay
forced
me
to
alter
my
judgment
once
again
is
a
sorely
difficult
thing
to
judge
the
truth
of
humankind
i
learned
now
beyond
doubt
that
fru
falkenberg
was
truly
and
honestly
jealous
of
her
husband
not
merely
pretending
to
be
as
so
by
way
of
covering
her
own
devious
ways
far
indeed
from
any
pretence
here
true
she
did
not
really
believe
for
a
moment
that
he
was
interested
in
her
maid
but
it
suited
her
purpose
to
pretend
she
did
in
her
extremity
she
would
use
any
means
that
came
to
hand
she
had
blushed
during
that
scene
in
the
kitchen
yes
indeed
but
that
was
a
sudden
and
natural
indignation
at
her
husband
words
nothing
more
but
she
had
no
objections
to
her
husband
imagining
she
was
jealous
of
the
girl
this
was
just
what
she
wanted
her
meaning
was
clear
enough
i
jealous
again
yes
you
can
see
it
all
the
same
as
before
with
me
here
i
am
fru
falkenberg
was
better
than
i
had
thought
for
many
years
now
the
pair
had
slipped
farther
and
farther
from
each
other
through
indifference
partly
perhaps
towards
the
last
in
defiance
now
she
would
take
the
first
step
and
show
that
she
cared
for
him
still
that
was
it
yes
but
in
face
of
the
one
she
feared
most
of
all
she
would
not
show
her
jealousy
for
worlds
and
that
was
elisabet
this
dangerous
friend
of
hers
who
was
so
many
years
younger
than
herself
yes
that
was
the
way
of
it
and
the
captain
was
he
moved
at
all
to
see
his
wife
flush
at
his
words
to
her
maid
maybe
a
shadow
of
memory
from
the
old
days
a
tingle
of
wonder
a
gladness
but
he
said
no
word
maybe
he
was
grown
prouder
and
more
obstinate
with
the
years
that
had
passed
it
might
well
seem
so
from
his
looks
then
it
was
there
came
the
happenings
i
spoke
of
iii
fru
falkenberg
had
been
playing
with
her
husband
now
for
some
little
time
she
affected
indifference
to
his
indifference
and
consoled
herself
with
the
casual
attentions
of
men
staying
in
the
house
now
one
and
now
another
of
them
left
but
stout
captain
bror
and
the
lady
with
the
shawl
stayed
on
and
lassen
the
young
engineer
stayed
too
captain
falkenberg
looked
on
as
if
to
say
well
and
good
stay
on
by
all
means
my
dear
fellow
as
long
as
you
and
it
made
no
impression
on
him
when
his
wife
said
du
to
lassen
and
called
him
hugo
hugo
she
would
call
standing
on
the
steps
looking
out
and
the
captain
would
volunteer
carelessly
hugo
just
gone
down
the
one
day
i
heard
him
answer
her
with
a
bitter
smile
and
a
wave
of
his
hand
towards
the
lilacs
little
king
hugo
is
waiting
for
you
in
his
i
saw
her
start
then
she
laughed
awkwardly
to
cover
her
confusion
and
went
down
in
search
of
lassen
at
last
she
had
managed
to
wring
some
expression
of
feeling
out
of
him
she
would
try
it
again
this
was
on
a
sunday
later
in
the
day
fruen
was
strangely
restless
she
said
a
few
kindly
words
to
me
and
mentioned
that
both
nils
and
i
had
managed
our
work
very
well
lars
has
been
to
the
post
office
today
she
said
to
fetch
a
letter
for
me
it
one
i
particularly
want
would
you
mind
going
up
to
his
place
and
bringing
it
down
for
me
i
said
i
would
with
pleasure
lars
wo
be
home
again
till
about
eleven
so
you
need
not
start
for
a
long
time
very
good
and
when
you
get
back
just
give
the
letter
to
it
was
the
first
time
fru
falkenberg
had
spoken
to
me
during
my
present
stay
at
øvrebø
it
was
something
so
new
i
went
up
afterwards
to
my
bedroom
and
sat
there
by
myself
feeling
as
if
something
had
really
happened
i
thought
over
one
or
two
things
a
little
as
well
it
was
simply
foolishness
i
told
myself
to
go
on
playing
the
stranger
here
and
pretending
nobody
knew
and
a
full
beard
was
a
nuisance
in
the
hot
weather
moreover
it
was
grey
and
made
me
look
ever
so
old
so
i
set
to
and
shaved
it
off
about
ten
i
started
out
towards
the
clearing
lars
was
not
back
i
stayed
there
a
while
with
emma
and
presently
he
came
in
i
took
the
letter
and
went
straight
home
it
was
close
on
midnight
ragnhild
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
the
other
maids
had
gone
to
bed
i
glanced
in
at
the
shrubbery
there
sat
captain
falkenberg
and
elisabet
talking
together
at
the
round
stone
table
they
took
no
notice
of
me
there
was
a
light
in
fruen
bedroom
upstairs
and
suddenly
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
looked
as
i
had
done
six
years
before
as
then
i
took
the
letter
out
of
my
pocket
and
went
in
the
main
entrance
to
give
it
to
fruen
myself
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
ragnhild
comes
slipping
noiselessly
towards
me
and
takes
the
letter
she
is
evidently
excited
i
can
feel
the
heat
of
her
breath
as
she
points
along
the
passage
there
is
a
sound
of
voices
from
the
far
end
it
looked
as
if
she
had
taken
up
her
post
here
on
guard
or
had
been
set
there
by
some
one
to
watch
however
it
was
no
business
of
mine
and
when
she
whispered
do
say
a
word
go
down
again
quietly
i
obeyed
and
went
to
my
room
my
window
was
open
i
could
hear
the
couple
down
among
the
bushes
they
were
drinking
wine
and
there
was
still
light
upstairs
in
fruen
room
ten
minutes
passed
then
the
light
went
out
a
moment
later
i
heard
some
one
hurrying
up
the
stairs
in
the
house
and
looked
down
involuntarily
to
see
if
it
was
the
captain
but
the
captain
was
sitting
as
before
now
came
the
same
steps
down
the
stairs
again
and
a
little
after
others
i
kept
watch
on
the
main
entrance
first
comes
ragnhild
flying
as
if
for
her
life
over
towards
the
servants
quarters
then
comes
fru
falkenberg
with
her
hair
down
and
the
letter
in
her
hand
showing
white
in
the
gloom
after
her
comes
the
engineer
the
pair
of
them
move
down
towards
the
high
road
ragnhild
comes
rushing
in
to
me
and
flings
herself
on
a
chair
all
out
of
breath
and
bursting
with
news
such
things
had
happened
this
evening
she
whispered
shut
the
window
fruen
and
that
engineer
fellow
never
a
thought
of
being
careful
was
as
near
as
ever
could
be
but
they
have
done
it
he
was
holding
on
to
her
when
ragnhild
went
in
with
the
letter
ugh
up
in
fruen
room
with
the
lamp
blown
out
you
mad
said
i
to
ragnhild
but
the
girl
had
both
heard
and
seen
well
enough
it
seemed
she
was
grown
so
used
to
playing
the
spy
that
she
could
not
help
spying
on
her
mistress
as
well
an
uncommon
sort
was
ragnhild
i
put
on
a
lofty
air
at
first
and
would
have
none
of
her
thank
you
listening
at
keyholes
fie
but
how
could
she
help
it
she
replied
her
orders
were
to
bring
up
the
letter
as
soon
as
her
mistress
put
out
the
light
and
not
before
but
fruen
windows
looked
out
to
the
shrubbery
where
the
captain
was
sitting
with
elisabet
from
the
vicarage
no
place
for
ragnhild
there
better
to
wait
upstairs
in
the
passage
and
just
take
a
look
at
the
keyhole
now
and
again
to
see
if
the
light
was
out
this
sounded
a
little
more
reasonable
but
only
think
of
it
said
ragnhild
suddenly
shaking
her
head
in
admiration
what
a
fellow
he
must
be
that
engineer
to
get
as
near
as
that
with
as
near
as
what
jealousy
seized
me
i
gave
up
my
lofty
pose
and
questioned
ragnhild
searchingly
about
it
all
what
did
she
say
they
were
doing
how
did
it
all
come
about
ragnhild
could
not
say
how
it
began
fruen
had
given
her
orders
about
a
letter
that
was
to
be
fetched
from
lars
falkenberg
and
when
it
arrived
she
was
to
wait
till
the
light
went
out
in
fruen
room
and
then
bring
it
up
very
good
said
ragnhild
but
not
till
i
put
out
the
light
you
understand
said
fruen
again
and
ragnhild
had
set
herself
to
wait
for
the
letter
but
the
time
seemed
endless
and
she
fell
to
thinking
and
wondering
about
it
all
there
was
something
strange
about
it
she
went
up
into
the
passage
and
listened
she
could
hear
fruen
and
the
engineer
talking
easily
and
without
restraint
stooping
down
to
the
keyhole
she
saw
her
mistress
loosening
her
hair
with
the
engineer
looking
on
and
saying
how
lovely
she
was
and
then
ah
that
engineer
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
was
it
ragnhild
saw
i
was
greatly
excited
and
tried
to
reassure
me
well
perhaps
not
quite
i
wo
be
sure
but
still
and
he
not
a
pretty
mouth
anyway
to
my
mind
i
say
though
you
shaved
all
clean
this
evening
how
nice
let
me
see
but
what
did
fruen
say
to
that
did
she
slip
away
yes
i
think
so
yes
of
course
she
did
and
did
she
though
yes
out
loud
and
he
said
and
every
time
she
raised
her
voice
he
said
again
but
fruen
said
let
them
hear
it
did
matter
they
were
sitting
down
there
making
love
in
the
shrubbery
themselves
that
what
she
said
and
it
was
the
captain
and
elisabet
from
the
vicarage
she
meant
you
can
see
them
she
said
and
went
to
the
window
know
i
know
says
the
engineer
for
heaven
sake
do
stand
there
with
your
hair
down
and
he
went
over
and
got
her
away
from
the
window
then
they
said
a
whole
heap
of
things
and
every
time
he
tried
to
whisper
fruen
talked
out
loud
again
only
you
would
shout
he
said
could
be
ever
so
quiet
up
here
then
she
was
quiet
for
a
bit
and
just
sat
there
smiling
at
him
without
a
word
she
was
ever
so
fond
of
was
she
yes
indeed
i
could
see
that
much
only
fancy
a
fellow
like
that
he
leaned
over
towards
her
and
put
his
hand
so
and
fruen
sat
still
and
let
him
well
yes
a
little
but
then
she
went
over
to
the
window
again
and
came
back
and
put
out
her
tongue
like
that
and
went
straight
up
to
him
and
kissed
him
i
ca
think
how
she
could
for
his
mouth
not
a
bit
nice
really
then
he
said
we
all
alone
and
we
can
hear
if
anybody
comes
about
bror
and
his
partner
said
she
they
are
out
somewhere
at
the
other
end
of
the
earth
said
he
all
alone
do
let
me
have
to
keep
on
asking
you
now
and
then
he
took
hold
of
her
and
picked
her
up
oh
he
was
so
strong
so
strong
no
leave
go
she
go
on
i
said
breathlessly
what
next
why
it
was
just
then
you
came
up
with
the
letter
and
i
did
see
what
happened
next
and
when
i
went
back
they
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
so
i
could
hardly
see
at
all
but
i
heard
fruen
saying
what
are
you
doing
no
no
we
must
she
must
have
been
in
his
arms
then
and
then
at
last
she
said
then
let
me
get
down
a
minute
and
he
let
her
go
out
the
lamp
she
said
and
then
it
was
all
dark
oh
but
now
i
was
at
my
wits
end
what
to
do
ragnhild
went
on
i
stood
a
minute
all
in
a
flurry
and
was
just
going
to
knock
at
the
door
all
at
once
yes
yes
why
did
you
what
on
earth
made
you
wait
at
all
why
if
i
had
then
fruen
have
known
in
a
moment
i
been
listening
outside
answered
the
girl
no
i
slipped
away
from
the
door
and
down
the
stairs
then
turned
back
and
went
up
again
treading
hard
so
fruen
could
hear
the
way
i
came
the
door
was
still
fastened
but
i
knocked
and
fruen
came
and
opened
it
but
the
engineer
was
just
behind
got
hold
of
her
clothes
and
was
simply
wild
after
her
go
go
he
kept
on
saying
and
never
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
me
but
then
when
i
turned
to
go
fruen
came
out
with
me
oh
but
only
think
it
was
as
near
as
could
be
a
long
restless
night
at
noon
when
we
men
came
home
from
the
fields
next
day
the
maids
were
whispering
something
about
a
scene
between
the
captain
and
his
wife
ragnhild
knew
all
about
it
the
captain
had
noticed
his
wife
with
her
hair
down
the
night
before
and
the
lamp
out
upstairs
and
laughed
at
her
hair
and
said
was
it
pretty
and
fruen
said
nothing
much
at
first
but
waited
her
chance
and
then
she
said
yes
i
know
i
like
to
let
my
hair
down
now
and
again
and
why
not
it
is
yours
she
was
none
so
clever
poor
thing
at
answering
back
in
a
quarrel
then
elisabet
had
come
up
and
put
in
her
word
and
she
was
smarter
fruen
did
manage
to
say
well
anyhow
we
were
in
the
house
but
you
two
were
sitting
out
among
the
bushes
and
elisabet
turned
sharp
at
that
and
snapped
out
we
did
put
out
the
light
and
if
we
did
said
fruen
it
made
no
difference
we
came
down
directly
heavens
i
thought
to
myself
why
ever
did
she
say
they
put
the
light
out
they
were
going
down
that
was
the
end
of
it
for
a
while
but
then
later
on
the
captain
said
something
about
fruen
being
so
much
older
than
elisabet
you
ought
always
to
wear
your
hair
down
he
said
on
my
word
it
made
you
look
quite
a
girl
oh
yes
i
dare
say
i
need
it
now
answered
fruen
but
seeing
elisabet
turn
away
laughing
she
flared
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
told
her
to
take
herself
off
and
elisabet
put
her
hands
on
her
hips
and
asked
the
captain
to
order
her
carriage
right
says
the
captain
at
that
and
i
drive
you
myself
all
this
ragnhild
had
heard
for
herself
standing
close
by
i
thought
to
myself
they
were
jealous
the
pair
of
them
she
of
this
sitting
out
in
the
shrubbery
and
he
of
her
letting
her
hair
down
and
putting
out
the
light
as
we
came
out
of
the
kitchen
and
were
going
across
for
a
rest
there
was
the
captain
busy
with
elisabet
carriage
he
called
me
up
and
said
i
ought
not
to
ask
you
now
when
you
having
your
rest
but
i
wish
you
go
down
and
mend
the
door
of
the
for
right
i
said
now
that
door
had
been
wrong
ever
since
the
engineer
burst
it
open
several
nights
before
what
made
the
captain
so
anxious
to
have
it
put
right
just
at
this
moment
he
have
no
use
for
the
summerhouse
while
he
was
driving
elisabet
home
was
it
because
he
wanted
to
shut
the
place
up
so
no
one
else
should
use
it
while
he
was
away
it
was
a
significant
move
if
so
i
took
some
tools
and
things
and
went
down
to
the
shrubbery
and
now
i
had
my
first
look
at
the
from
inside
it
was
comparatively
new
it
had
not
been
there
six
years
before
a
roomy
place
with
pictures
on
the
walls
and
even
an
alarm
clock
now
run
down
chairs
with
cushions
a
table
and
an
upholstered
settee
covered
with
red
plush
the
blinds
were
down
i
set
a
couple
of
pieces
in
the
roof
first
where
i
smashed
it
with
my
empty
bottle
then
i
took
off
the
lock
to
see
what
was
wrong
there
while
i
was
busy
with
this
the
captain
came
up
he
had
evidently
been
drinking
already
that
day
or
was
suffering
from
a
heavy
bout
the
night
before
that
no
burglary
he
said
either
the
door
must
have
been
left
open
and
slammed
itself
to
bits
or
some
one
must
have
stumbled
up
against
it
in
the
dark
one
of
the
visitors
perhaps
that
left
the
other
but
the
door
had
been
roughly
handled
one
could
see
the
lock
was
burst
open
and
the
woodwork
on
the
inside
of
the
frame
torn
away
let
me
see
put
a
new
bolt
in
here
and
force
the
spring
back
in
place
said
the
captain
examining
the
lock
he
sat
down
in
a
chair
fru
falkenberg
came
down
the
stone
steps
to
the
shrubbery
and
called
is
the
captain
there
yes
said
i
then
she
came
up
her
face
was
twitching
with
emotion
i
like
a
word
with
you
she
said
i
wo
keep
you
the
captain
answered
without
rising
certainly
will
you
sit
down
or
would
you
rather
stand
no
do
run
away
you
i
none
too
much
time
as
it
is
he
said
sharply
to
me
this
i
took
to
mean
that
he
wanted
the
lock
mended
so
he
could
take
the
key
with
him
when
he
went
i
dare
say
it
was
i
ought
to
have
said
what
i
did
fruen
began
the
captain
made
no
answer
but
his
silence
after
she
had
come
down
on
purpose
to
try
and
make
it
up
was
more
than
she
could
bear
she
ended
by
saying
oh
well
all
the
same
i
do
and
she
turned
to
go
did
you
want
to
speak
to
me
asked
the
captain
oh
no
it
does
matter
thanks
i
sha
very
well
said
the
captain
he
smiled
as
he
spoke
he
was
drunk
no
doubt
and
angry
about
something
but
fruen
turned
as
she
passed
by
me
in
the
doorway
and
said
you
ought
not
to
drive
down
there
today
there
gossip
enough
you
need
not
listen
to
it
he
answered
it
ca
go
on
like
this
you
know
she
said
again
and
you
seem
to
think
of
the
disgrace
we
both
a
little
thoughtless
in
that
respect
he
answered
carelessly
looking
round
at
the
walls
i
took
the
lock
and
stepped
outside
here
do
go
running
away
now
cried
the
captain
i
in
a
hurry
yes
you
in
a
hurry
of
course
repeated
fruen
going
away
again
but
you
do
well
to
think
it
over
just
for
once
i
been
thinking
things
over
myself
lately
only
you
would
see
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
haughty
and
stiff
as
ever
was
it
your
fooling
about
at
night
with
your
hair
down
and
lights
out
you
thought
i
would
see
oh
yes
no
doubt
i
have
to
finish
this
on
the
anvil
said
i
and
hurried
off
i
stayed
away
longer
than
was
needed
but
when
i
came
back
fruen
was
still
there
they
were
talking
louder
than
before
and
do
you
know
what
i
have
done
said
fruen
i
lowered
myself
so
far
as
to
show
i
was
jealous
yes
i
done
that
oh
only
about
the
maid
i
mean
well
and
what
then
said
the
captain
oh
wo
you
understand
well
have
it
your
own
way
then
you
have
to
take
the
consequences
later
make
no
mistake
about
that
these
were
her
last
words
and
they
sounded
like
an
arrow
striking
a
shield
she
stepped
out
and
strode
away
manage
it
all
right
said
the
captain
as
i
came
up
but
i
could
see
his
thoughts
were
busy
with
other
things
he
was
trying
to
appear
unconcerned
a
little
after
he
managed
to
yawn
and
said
lazily
ugh
it
a
long
drive
but
if
nils
ca
spare
a
hand
i
must
go
i
had
only
to
fix
the
lock
in
its
place
and
set
a
new
strip
down
the
inside
of
the
it
was
soon
done
the
captain
tried
the
door
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
thanked
me
for
the
work
and
went
off
a
little
later
he
drove
away
with
elisabet
see
you
again
soon
he
called
to
captain
bror
and
engineer
lassen
waving
his
hand
to
them
both
mind
that
you
have
a
good
time
while
away
iv
evening
came
and
what
would
happen
now
a
great
deal
as
it
turned
out
it
started
early
we
men
were
at
supper
while
they
were
having
dinner
up
at
the
house
and
we
could
hear
them
carrying
on
as
gaily
as
could
be
ragnhild
was
taking
in
trays
of
food
and
bottles
and
waiting
at
table
once
when
she
came
out
she
laughed
to
herself
and
said
to
the
other
girls
i
believe
fruen
drunk
herself
i
had
not
slept
the
night
before
nor
had
my
midday
rest
i
was
troubled
and
nervous
after
all
that
had
happened
the
last
two
days
so
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
my
supper
i
went
out
and
up
to
the
woods
to
be
alone
i
stayed
there
a
long
while
i
looked
down
towards
the
house
the
captain
away
the
servants
gone
to
rest
the
beasts
in
stable
and
shed
fast
asleep
stout
captain
bror
and
his
lady
too
had
doubtless
found
a
quiet
corner
all
to
themselves
after
dinner
he
was
simply
wild
about
the
woman
for
all
he
was
old
and
fat
and
she
herself
no
longer
young
that
left
only
fru
falkenberg
and
the
young
engineer
and
where
would
they
be
now
was
their
affair
i
sauntered
home
again
yawning
and
shivering
a
little
in
the
cool
night
and
went
up
to
my
room
after
a
while
ragnhild
came
up
and
begged
me
to
keep
awake
and
be
ready
to
help
in
case
of
need
it
was
horrible
she
said
they
were
carrying
on
like
mad
things
up
at
the
house
walking
about
from
one
room
to
another
half
undressed
and
drunk
as
well
was
fruen
drunk
too
yes
she
was
and
was
she
walking
about
half
undressed
no
but
captain
bror
was
and
fruen
clapped
her
hands
and
cried
bravo
and
the
engineer
as
well
it
was
one
as
bad
as
the
other
and
ragnhild
had
just
taken
in
two
more
bottles
of
wine
though
they
were
drunk
already
come
over
with
me
and
you
can
hear
them
yourself
said
ragnhild
they
up
in
fruen
room
no
i
said
i
going
to
bed
and
you
better
go
but
they
ring
in
a
minute
and
be
wanting
something
if
i
let
them
ring
and
then
it
was
ragnhild
confessed
that
the
captain
himself
had
asked
her
to
stay
up
that
night
in
case
fruen
should
want
her
this
altered
the
whole
aspect
of
affairs
in
a
moment
evidently
the
captain
had
feared
something
might
happen
and
set
ragnhild
on
guard
in
case
i
put
on
my
blouse
again
and
went
across
with
her
to
the
house
we
went
upstairs
and
stood
in
the
passage
we
could
hear
them
laughing
and
making
a
noise
in
fruen
room
but
fruen
herself
spoke
as
clearly
as
ever
and
was
not
drunk
at
all
yes
she
is
said
ragnhild
anyhow
she
not
like
herself
i
wished
i
could
have
seen
her
for
a
moment
we
went
back
to
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
but
i
was
restless
all
the
time
after
a
little
i
took
down
the
lamp
from
the
wall
and
told
ragnhild
to
follow
me
we
went
upstairs
again
no
go
in
and
ask
fruen
to
come
out
here
to
me
i
said
why
whatever
for
i
a
message
for
and
ragnhild
knocked
at
the
door
and
went
in
it
was
only
at
the
last
moment
i
hit
on
any
message
to
give
i
could
simply
look
her
straight
in
the
face
and
say
the
captain
sent
his
kind
footnote
bad
mig
hilse
literally
the
captain
bade
me
greet
such
a
message
would
not
seem
quite
so
uncalled
for
in
norway
such
greetings
being
given
and
sent
more
frequently
and
on
slighter
occasions
than
with
us
would
that
be
enough
i
might
say
more
the
captain
was
obliged
to
drive
himself
because
nils
could
spare
any
one
to
but
a
moment
can
be
long
at
times
and
thought
a
lightning
flash
i
found
time
to
reject
both
these
plans
and
hatch
out
another
before
fruen
came
though
i
doubt
if
my
last
plan
was
any
better
fruen
asked
in
surprise
well
what
do
you
want
ragnhild
came
up
too
and
looked
at
me
wonderingly
i
turned
the
lamp
towards
fruen
face
and
said
i
beg
pardon
for
coming
up
so
late
i
be
going
to
the
post
first
thing
tomorrow
i
thought
if
perhaps
fruen
had
any
letters
to
go
letters
no
she
answered
shaking
her
head
there
was
an
absent
look
in
her
eyes
but
she
did
not
look
in
the
least
as
if
she
had
been
drinking
no
i
no
letters
she
said
and
moved
to
go
beg
pardon
then
i
said
was
it
the
captain
told
you
to
go
to
the
post
she
asked
no
i
was
just
going
for
she
turned
and
went
back
to
her
room
before
she
was
well
through
the
door
i
heard
her
say
to
the
others
a
nice
pretext
ragnhild
and
i
went
down
again
i
had
seen
her
oh
but
i
was
humbled
now
indeed
and
it
did
not
ease
my
mind
at
all
when
ragnhild
incautiously
let
out
a
further
piece
of
news
it
seemed
she
had
been
romancing
before
it
was
not
true
about
the
having
asked
her
to
keep
a
look
out
i
grew
more
and
more
convinced
in
my
own
mind
ragnhild
was
playing
the
spy
on
her
own
account
for
sheer
love
of
the
game
i
left
her
and
went
up
to
my
room
what
had
my
clumsy
intrusion
gained
for
me
after
all
a
pretext
she
had
said
clearly
she
had
seen
through
it
all
disgusted
with
myself
i
vowed
that
for
the
future
i
would
leave
things
and
people
to
themselves
i
threw
myself
down
fully
dressed
on
the
bed
after
a
while
i
heard
fru
falkenberg
voice
outside
in
front
of
the
house
my
window
was
open
and
she
spoke
loudly
enough
the
engineer
was
with
her
putting
in
a
word
now
and
again
fruen
was
in
raptures
over
the
weather
so
fine
it
was
and
such
a
warm
night
oh
it
was
lovely
out
now
ever
so
much
nicer
than
indoors
but
her
voice
seemed
a
trifle
less
clear
now
than
before
i
ran
to
the
window
and
saw
the
pair
of
them
standing
by
the
steps
that
led
down
to
the
shrubbery
the
engineer
seemed
to
have
something
on
his
mind
that
he
had
not
been
able
to
get
said
before
do
listen
to
me
now
he
said
then
followed
a
brief
and
earnest
pleading
which
was
answered
ay
and
rewarded
he
spoke
as
if
to
one
hard
of
hearing
because
she
had
been
deaf
to
his
words
so
long
they
stood
there
by
the
stone
steps
neither
of
them
caring
for
any
one
else
in
the
world
let
any
listen
or
watch
who
pleased
the
night
was
theirs
the
world
was
theirs
and
the
was
about
them
drawing
them
together
he
watched
her
like
a
cat
every
movement
of
her
body
set
his
blood
tingling
he
was
ready
to
spring
upon
her
in
a
moment
and
when
it
came
near
to
action
there
was
a
power
of
will
in
his
manner
towards
her
ay
the
young
spark
i
begged
and
prayed
you
long
enough
he
said
breathlessly
yesterday
you
all
but
would
today
you
deaf
again
you
think
you
and
bror
and
tante
footnote
evidently
captain
bror
lady
is
meant
and
the
rest
are
to
have
a
good
time
and
no
harm
done
while
i
look
on
and
play
the
nice
young
man
but
by
heaven
you
wrong
here
you
yourself
a
garden
of
all
good
things
right
in
front
of
me
and
a
fence
do
you
know
what
i
going
to
do
now
with
that
silly
fence
what
are
you
going
to
do
no
hugo
you
had
too
much
to
drink
this
evening
you
so
young
we
both
drunk
more
than
we
ought
she
said
and
then
you
play
me
false
into
the
bargain
with
your
tricks
you
send
a
special
messenger
for
a
letter
that
simply
ca
wait
and
at
the
same
time
you
cruel
enough
to
let
me
think
to
promise
me
i
never
do
it
again
never
do
it
again
what
do
you
mean
by
that
when
you
can
go
up
to
a
man
yes
to
me
and
kiss
me
like
you
did
what
the
good
of
saying
you
never
do
it
any
more
it
done
and
a
kiss
like
that
not
a
thing
to
forget
i
can
feel
it
still
and
it
a
mad
delight
and
i
thank
you
for
it
you
got
that
letter
in
your
dress
let
me
see
you
so
excited
hugo
no
it
getting
late
now
we
better
say
will
you
show
me
that
letter
show
you
the
letter
certainly
not
at
that
he
made
a
as
if
to
take
it
by
force
but
checked
himself
and
snapped
out
what
you
wo
well
on
my
word
you
are
mean
not
the
word
for
it
you
something
worse
hugo
yes
you
are
if
you
see
the
letter
here
it
is
she
thrust
her
hand
into
her
blouse
took
out
the
letter
opened
it
and
waved
it
at
him
flourishing
her
innocence
here
the
letter
from
my
mother
there
her
signature
look
from
mother
and
now
what
have
you
to
say
he
quailed
as
if
at
a
blow
and
only
said
from
your
mother
why
then
it
did
matter
at
all
no
there
you
are
oh
but
of
course
it
did
matter
in
a
way
but
still
he
leaned
up
against
the
fence
and
began
to
work
it
out
from
your
mother
i
see
a
letter
from
your
mother
came
and
interrupted
us
do
you
know
what
i
think
you
been
cheating
been
fooling
me
all
along
i
can
see
it
all
she
tried
again
it
was
an
important
letter
mama
is
coming
she
coming
here
to
stay
very
soon
and
i
was
waiting
to
you
were
cheating
all
the
time
were
you
he
said
again
let
them
bring
in
the
letter
just
at
the
right
moment
when
we
put
out
the
light
yes
that
it
you
were
just
leading
me
on
to
see
how
far
go
and
kept
your
maid
close
at
hand
to
protect
oh
do
be
sensible
it
ever
so
late
we
must
go
ugh
i
had
too
much
to
drink
up
there
i
think
ca
talk
straight
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
letter
and
went
on
about
it
again
for
there
was
no
need
to
have
all
that
mystery
about
a
letter
from
home
no
i
see
it
all
now
want
to
go
in
you
say
well
then
go
in
fru
by
all
means
my
dutiful
respects
as
from
a
he
bowed
and
stood
watching
her
with
a
sneering
smile
a
son
oh
yes
she
replied
with
sudden
emotion
i
am
old
yes
and
you
are
so
young
hugo
that
true
and
that
why
i
kissed
you
but
i
could
be
your
mother
no
it
only
that
i
older
ever
so
much
older
than
you
but
i
not
quite
an
old
woman
yet
and
that
you
should
see
if
only
but
i
older
than
elisabet
and
every
one
else
oh
what
am
i
talking
about
not
a
bit
of
it
i
do
know
what
else
the
years
may
have
done
to
me
but
they
have
made
me
an
old
woman
yet
have
they
what
do
you
think
yourself
oh
but
what
do
you
know
about
it
no
no
he
said
softly
but
is
there
any
sense
in
going
on
like
this
here
are
you
young
as
you
are
with
nothing
on
earth
to
do
all
the
time
but
keep
guard
over
yourself
and
get
others
to
do
the
same
and
the
lord
in
heaven
knows
you
promised
me
a
thing
but
it
means
so
little
to
you
you
take
a
pleasure
in
putting
me
off
and
beating
me
down
with
your
great
white
great
white
wings
she
murmured
to
herself
yes
you
might
have
great
red
wings
look
at
yourself
now
standing
there
all
lovely
as
you
are
and
all
for
oh
i
think
the
wine
has
gone
to
my
head
all
for
nothing
indeed
then
suddenly
she
takes
his
hand
and
leads
him
down
the
steps
i
can
hear
her
voice
why
should
i
care
does
he
imagine
elisabet
so
much
better
they
pass
along
the
path
to
the
here
she
hesitates
and
stops
oh
where
are
we
going
she
asks
haha
we
must
be
mad
you
have
thought
i
was
mad
would
you
i
not
either
that
is
to
say
yes
i
am
now
and
again
there
the
door
locked
very
well
we
go
away
again
but
what
a
mean
trick
to
lock
the
door
when
we
want
to
go
full
of
bitterness
and
suspicion
he
answered
now
you
cheating
again
you
knew
well
enough
the
door
was
oh
must
you
always
think
the
worst
of
me
but
why
should
he
lock
the
door
so
carefully
and
have
the
place
all
to
himself
yes
i
know
it
was
locked
and
that
why
i
came
with
you
i
dare
not
no
hugo
i
wo
i
mean
it
oh
are
you
mad
come
back
she
took
his
hand
again
and
tried
to
turn
back
they
stood
struggling
a
little
for
he
would
not
follow
then
in
his
passion
and
strength
he
threw
both
arms
round
her
and
kissed
her
again
and
again
and
she
weakened
ever
more
and
more
speaking
brokenly
between
the
kisses
i
never
kissed
any
other
man
before
never
it
true
i
swear
it
i
never
kissed
no
no
no
he
answers
impatiently
drawing
her
step
by
step
the
way
he
will
outside
the
he
looses
his
hold
of
her
a
moment
flings
himself
one
shoulder
forward
heavily
against
the
door
and
breaks
it
open
for
the
second
time
then
in
one
stride
he
is
beside
her
once
more
neither
speaks
but
even
at
the
door
she
checks
again
stands
clinging
to
the
and
will
not
move
no
no
i
never
been
unfaithful
to
him
yet
i
wo
never
never
he
draws
her
to
him
suddenly
kisses
her
a
full
minute
two
minutes
a
deep
unbroken
kiss
she
leans
back
from
the
waist
her
hand
slips
where
it
holds
and
she
gives
way
a
white
mist
gathers
before
my
eyes
so
they
have
come
to
it
now
now
he
takes
her
has
his
will
and
joy
of
her
a
melancholy
weariness
and
rest
comes
over
me
i
feel
miserable
and
alone
it
is
late
my
heart
has
had
its
day
through
the
white
mist
comes
a
leaping
figure
it
is
ragnhild
coming
up
from
among
the
bushes
running
with
her
tongue
thrust
out
the
engineer
came
up
to
me
nodded
and
asked
me
to
mend
the
door
is
it
broken
again
yes
it
got
broken
last
it
was
early
for
him
to
be
about
no
more
than
halfpast
four
we
had
not
yet
started
for
the
fields
his
eyes
showed
small
and
glittering
as
if
they
burned
likely
enough
he
had
not
slept
all
night
but
he
said
nothing
as
to
how
the
door
had
got
broken
not
for
any
thought
of
him
but
for
captain
falkenberg
sake
i
went
down
at
once
to
the
and
mended
the
door
once
again
no
need
for
such
haste
maybe
the
captain
had
a
long
drive
there
and
back
but
it
was
close
on
hours
now
since
he
started
the
engineer
came
down
with
me
without
in
the
least
perceiving
how
it
came
about
i
found
myself
thinking
well
of
him
he
had
broken
open
that
door
last
night
quite
so
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
sneak
out
of
it
after
he
and
no
one
other
it
was
who
had
it
mended
eh
well
perhaps
after
all
was
only
my
vanity
was
pleased
i
felt
flattered
at
his
trusting
to
my
silence
that
was
it
that
was
how
i
came
to
think
well
of
him
i
in
charge
of
some
on
the
rivers
he
said
how
long
are
you
staying
here
not
for
long
till
the
over
for
the
i
could
give
you
work
if
you
care
about
now
this
was
work
i
knew
nothing
of
and
what
was
more
i
liked
to
be
among
field
and
forest
not
with
lumbermen
and
proletariat
however
i
thanked
him
for
the
offer
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
put
this
right
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
broke
it
open
looking
for
a
gun
i
wanted
to
shoot
something
and
i
thought
there
might
be
a
gun
in
i
made
no
answer
it
would
have
pleased
me
better
if
he
had
said
nothing
so
i
thought
i
ask
you
before
you
started
out
to
work
he
said
to
finish
off
i
put
the
lock
right
and
set
it
in
its
place
again
and
began
nailing
up
the
woodwork
which
was
shattered
as
before
while
i
was
busy
with
this
we
heard
captain
falkenberg
voice
through
the
bushes
we
could
see
him
unharnessing
the
horses
and
leading
them
in
the
engineer
gave
a
start
he
fumbled
for
his
watch
and
got
it
out
but
his
eyes
had
grown
all
big
and
empty
they
could
see
nothing
suddenly
he
said
oh
i
forgot
i
must
and
he
hurried
off
far
down
the
garden
so
he
going
to
sneak
out
of
it
after
all
i
thought
to
myself
a
moment
later
the
captain
himself
came
down
he
was
pale
and
covered
with
dust
and
plainly
had
not
slept
but
perfectly
sober
he
called
to
me
from
a
distance
hei
how
did
you
get
in
there
i
touched
my
cap
but
said
nothing
somebody
been
breaking
in
again
it
was
only
i
just
remembered
i
left
out
a
couple
of
nails
here
yesterday
it
all
right
now
if
captain
will
lock
up
again
fool
that
i
was
if
that
was
the
best
excuse
i
could
find
he
would
see
through
it
all
at
once
he
stood
for
a
few
seconds
looking
at
the
door
with
eyes
he
had
his
suspicions
no
doubt
then
he
took
out
the
key
locked
up
the
place
and
walked
off
what
else
could
he
do
v
all
the
guests
are
gone
stout
captain
bror
the
lady
with
the
shawl
engineer
lassen
as
well
and
captain
falkenberg
is
getting
ready
to
start
for
manoeuvres
at
last
it
struck
me
that
he
must
have
applied
for
leave
on
very
special
grounds
or
he
would
have
been
away
on
duty
long
before
this
we
have
been
hard
at
work
in
the
fields
the
last
few
days
a
heavy
strain
on
man
and
beast
but
nils
knew
what
he
was
doing
he
wanted
to
gain
time
for
something
else
one
day
he
set
me
to
work
cleaning
up
all
round
outside
the
house
and
buildings
it
took
all
the
time
gained
and
more
but
it
made
the
whole
place
look
different
altogether
and
that
was
what
nils
wanted
to
cheer
the
captain
up
a
little
before
he
left
home
and
i
turned
to
of
my
own
accord
and
fixed
up
a
loose
pale
or
so
in
the
garden
fence
straightened
the
door
of
a
shed
that
was
wry
on
its
hinges
and
and
the
barn
bridge
too
needed
mending
i
thought
of
putting
in
new
beams
where
will
you
be
going
when
you
leave
here
asked
the
captain
i
do
know
i
be
on
the
road
for
a
i
could
do
with
you
here
for
a
while
there
a
lot
of
things
that
want
captain
was
thinking
of
paintwork
maybe
painting
too
yes
i
not
sure
about
that
though
it
would
be
a
costly
business
with
the
outbuildings
and
all
no
i
was
thinking
of
something
else
do
you
know
anything
about
timber
now
could
you
mark
down
for
yourself
it
pleased
him
then
to
pretend
he
did
not
recognize
me
from
the
time
i
had
worked
in
his
timber
before
but
was
there
anything
left
now
to
fell
i
answered
him
ay
i
used
to
timber
where
would
it
be
this
year
anywhere
wherever
you
like
there
must
be
something
left
ay
i
laid
the
new
beams
in
the
barn
bridge
and
when
that
was
done
i
took
down
the
flagstaff
and
put
on
a
new
knob
and
line
øvrebø
was
looking
quite
nice
already
and
nils
said
it
made
him
feel
better
only
to
look
at
it
i
got
him
to
talk
to
the
captain
and
put
in
a
word
about
the
paintwork
but
the
captain
had
looked
at
him
with
a
troubled
air
and
said
yes
yes
i
know
but
paint
not
the
only
thing
we
got
to
think
about
wait
till
the
autumn
and
see
how
the
crops
turn
out
sowed
a
lot
this
but
when
the
flagstaff
stood
there
with
the
old
paint
all
scraped
off
and
a
new
knob
and
halliards
the
captain
could
not
help
noticing
it
and
ordered
some
paint
by
telegraph
though
to
be
sure
there
was
no
such
hurry
as
all
that
a
letter
by
the
post
had
been
enough
two
days
passed
the
paint
arrived
but
was
put
aside
for
the
time
being
we
had
not
done
with
the
yet
by
a
long
way
though
we
were
using
both
the
carriage
horses
for
sowing
and
harrowing
and
when
it
came
to
planting
potatoes
nils
had
to
ask
up
at
the
house
for
the
maids
to
come
and
help
the
captain
gave
him
leave
said
yes
to
all
that
was
asked
and
went
off
to
manoeuvres
so
we
were
left
to
ourselves
but
there
was
a
big
scene
between
husband
and
wife
before
he
went
every
one
of
us
on
the
place
knew
there
was
trouble
between
them
and
ragnhild
and
the
dairymaid
were
always
talking
about
it
the
fields
were
coming
on
nicely
now
and
you
could
see
the
change
in
the
grassland
from
day
to
day
it
was
fine
spring
weather
and
all
things
doing
well
that
grew
but
there
was
trouble
and
strife
at
øvrebø
fruen
could
be
seen
at
times
with
a
face
that
showed
she
had
been
crying
or
other
times
with
an
air
of
exaggerated
haughtiness
as
if
she
cared
nothing
for
any
one
her
mother
came
a
pale
quiet
lady
with
spectacles
and
a
face
like
a
mouse
she
did
not
stay
long
only
a
few
days
then
she
went
back
to
kristianssand
that
was
where
she
lived
the
air
here
did
not
agree
with
her
she
said
ah
that
great
scene
a
bitter
final
reckoning
that
lasted
over
an
hour
ragnhild
told
us
all
about
it
afterwards
neither
the
captain
nor
fruen
raised
their
voices
but
the
words
came
slow
and
strong
and
in
their
bitterness
the
pair
of
them
agreed
to
go
each
their
own
way
from
now
on
oh
you
do
say
so
cried
all
in
the
kitchen
clasping
their
hands
ragnhild
drew
herself
up
and
began
mimicking
been
breaking
into
the
again
with
some
one
said
the
captain
said
fruen
what
more
he
asked
said
she
the
captain
smiled
at
that
and
said
something
frank
and
open
about
an
answer
like
that
you
can
see
what
is
meant
almost
at
once
fruen
said
nothing
to
that
you
can
see
in
that
young
puppy
i
do
know
though
he
did
help
me
once
out
of
a
fix
fruen
looked
at
him
then
and
said
you
said
the
captain
a
bill
for
me
once
and
fruen
asked
did
know
that
then
the
captain
he
tell
you
that
fruen
shook
her
head
what
then
he
said
again
it
have
made
any
difference
if
he
had
said
fruen
at
first
and
then
you
fond
of
him
he
asked
and
she
turned
on
him
at
once
you
fond
of
elisabet
answered
the
captain
but
he
sat
smiling
after
that
and
good
said
fruen
sharply
then
there
was
a
long
silence
the
captain
was
the
first
to
speak
were
right
when
you
said
that
about
thinking
over
things
i
been
doing
so
i
not
a
vicious
man
really
queerly
enough
i
never
really
cared
about
drinking
and
playing
the
fool
and
yet
i
suppose
i
did
in
a
way
but
there
an
end
of
it
now
much
the
better
for
you
she
answered
sullenly
so
says
he
again
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
been
a
bit
glad
to
hear
it
can
get
elisabet
to
do
that
says
she
says
he
just
that
one
word
and
shakes
his
head
then
they
said
nothing
for
quite
a
while
are
you
going
to
do
now
asks
the
captain
do
trouble
yourself
about
me
said
fruen
very
slowly
can
be
a
nurse
if
you
like
or
cut
my
hair
short
and
be
a
school
teacher
if
you
like
i
like
says
he
decide
for
yourself
want
to
know
what
you
are
going
to
do
first
she
says
going
to
stay
here
where
i
am
he
answered
you
turned
yourself
out
of
doors
and
fruen
nodded
and
said
well
oh
from
all
in
the
kitchen
oh
but
it
will
come
right
again
surely
said
nils
looking
round
at
the
rest
of
us
to
see
what
we
thought
for
a
couple
of
days
after
the
captain
had
gone
fruen
sat
playing
the
piano
all
the
time
on
the
third
day
nils
drove
her
to
the
station
she
was
going
to
stay
with
her
mother
at
kristianssand
that
left
us
more
alone
than
ever
fruen
had
not
taken
any
of
her
things
with
her
perhaps
she
felt
they
were
not
really
hers
perhaps
they
had
all
come
from
him
originally
and
she
did
not
care
to
have
them
now
oh
but
it
was
all
a
misery
ragnhild
was
not
to
go
away
her
mistress
had
said
but
it
was
cook
that
was
left
in
charge
of
everything
and
kept
the
keys
which
was
best
for
all
concerned
on
saturday
the
captain
came
back
home
on
leave
nils
said
he
never
used
to
do
that
before
fine
and
upright
in
his
bearing
he
was
for
all
that
his
wife
was
gone
away
and
he
was
sober
as
could
be
he
gave
me
orders
very
short
and
clear
about
the
timber
came
out
with
me
and
showed
me
here
and
there
battens
down
to
smallest
battens
a
thousand
dozen
i
shall
be
away
three
weeks
this
time
he
said
on
the
sunday
afternoon
he
went
off
again
he
was
more
determined
in
his
manner
now
more
like
himself
we
were
through
with
the
at
last
and
the
was
done
after
that
nils
and
the
lad
could
manage
the
daily
work
by
themselves
and
i
went
up
to
my
new
work
among
the
timber
good
days
these
were
for
me
all
through
warm
and
rainy
at
first
making
the
woods
all
wet
but
i
went
out
all
the
same
and
never
stayed
in
on
that
account
then
a
spell
of
hot
weather
set
in
and
in
the
light
evenings
after
i
got
home
from
work
it
was
a
pleasure
to
go
round
mending
and
seeing
to
little
things
here
and
there
a
a
window
and
the
like
at
last
i
got
the
escape
ladder
up
and
set
to
scraping
the
old
paint
from
the
north
wall
of
the
barn
it
was
flaking
away
there
of
itself
it
would
be
a
neat
piece
of
work
if
i
could
get
the
barn
done
this
summer
after
all
and
the
paint
was
there
all
ready
but
there
was
another
thing
that
made
me
weary
at
times
of
the
work
and
the
whole
place
it
was
not
the
same
working
there
now
as
when
the
captain
and
fruen
were
home
i
found
here
confirmation
of
the
truth
that
it
is
well
for
a
man
to
have
some
one
over
him
at
his
work
that
is
if
he
is
not
himself
in
charge
as
leading
man
here
were
the
maids
now
going
about
the
place
with
none
to
look
after
them
ragnhild
and
the
dairymaid
were
always
laughing
and
joking
noisily
at
and
quarreling
now
and
again
between
themselves
the
cook
authority
was
not
always
enough
to
keep
the
peace
and
this
often
made
things
uncomfortable
also
it
seemed
that
some
one
must
have
been
talking
to
lars
falkenberg
my
good
old
comrade
that
had
been
and
made
him
suspicious
of
me
now
lars
came
in
one
evening
and
took
me
aside
he
had
come
to
say
he
forbade
me
to
show
myself
on
his
place
again
his
manner
was
comically
threatening
now
i
had
not
been
there
more
than
a
few
times
with
washing
maybe
half
a
dozen
times
in
all
he
had
been
out
but
emma
and
i
had
talked
a
bit
of
old
things
and
new
the
last
time
i
was
there
lars
came
home
suddenly
and
made
a
scene
the
moment
he
got
inside
the
door
because
emma
was
sitting
on
a
stool
in
her
petticoat
it
too
hot
for
a
skirt
she
said
ho
yes
and
your
hair
all
down
your
back
too
hot
to
put
it
up
i
suppose
he
retorted
altogether
he
was
in
a
rage
with
her
i
said
to
him
as
i
left
but
he
did
not
answer
i
had
not
been
there
since
then
what
made
him
come
over
like
this
all
of
a
sudden
i
set
it
down
as
more
of
ragnhild
mischievous
work
when
he
had
told
me
in
so
many
words
he
forbade
me
to
enter
his
house
lars
nodded
and
looked
at
me
to
his
mind
i
ought
now
to
be
as
one
dead
and
i
heard
emma
been
down
here
he
went
on
but
she
come
no
more
i
fancy
after
she
may
have
been
here
once
or
twice
for
the
ho
yes
the
washing
of
course
and
you
coming
up
yourself
heaven
knows
how
many
times
a
week
more
washing
bring
up
a
shirt
one
day
and
a
pair
of
drawers
the
next
that
what
you
do
but
you
can
get
ragnhild
to
do
your
washing
well
and
aha
my
friend
i
know
you
and
your
little
ways
going
and
visiting
and
making
yourself
sweet
to
folk
when
you
find
them
all
alone
but
not
for
me
thank
you
nils
comes
up
to
us
now
guessing
no
doubt
what
the
trouble
and
ready
to
put
in
a
word
for
me
like
the
good
comrade
he
is
he
catches
the
last
words
and
gives
me
a
testimonial
on
the
spot
to
the
effect
that
he
never
seen
anything
wrong
about
me
all
the
time
i
been
on
the
place
but
lars
falkenberg
bridles
up
at
once
and
puts
on
airs
looking
nils
up
and
down
with
contempt
he
has
a
grudge
against
nils
already
for
though
lars
had
managed
well
enough
since
he
got
his
own
little
place
up
in
the
wood
he
had
never
equalled
nils
work
here
on
the
captain
land
and
lars
falkenberg
feels
himself
aggrieved
what
have
you
got
to
come
cackling
about
he
asks
i
saying
what
is
the
truth
that
all
answers
nils
ho
are
you
you
goat
if
you
want
me
to
wipe
the
floor
with
you
do
it
on
the
spot
nils
and
i
walked
away
but
lars
still
shouted
after
us
and
there
was
ragnhild
of
course
sniffing
at
the
lilacs
as
we
passed
that
evening
i
began
to
think
about
moving
on
again
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
my
work
in
the
timber
when
the
three
weeks
were
up
the
captain
came
back
as
he
had
said
he
noticed
i
had
scraped
the
northern
wall
of
the
barn
and
was
pleased
with
me
for
that
end
of
it
be
you
have
to
paint
that
again
too
he
said
i
told
him
how
far
i
had
got
with
the
timber
there
was
not
much
left
now
well
keep
at
it
and
do
some
more
was
all
he
said
then
he
went
back
to
his
duty
again
for
another
three
weeks
but
i
did
not
care
to
stay
another
three
weeks
at
øvrebø
as
things
were
now
i
marked
down
a
few
score
dozen
battens
and
reckoned
it
all
out
on
my
paper
that
would
have
to
do
but
it
was
still
too
early
for
a
man
to
live
in
the
forests
and
hills
the
flowers
were
come
but
there
were
no
berries
yet
song
and
twitter
of
birds
at
their
mating
flies
and
midges
and
moths
but
no
cloudberries
no
angelica
in
town
i
came
in
to
engineer
lassen
inspector
of
rafting
sections
and
he
took
me
on
as
he
had
promised
though
it
was
late
in
the
season
now
to
begin
with
i
am
to
make
a
tour
of
the
water
and
see
where
the
logs
have
gathered
thickest
noting
down
the
places
on
a
chart
he
is
quite
a
good
fellow
the
engineer
only
still
very
young
he
gives
me
instructions
about
things
he
fancies
i
do
know
already
it
makes
him
seem
a
trifle
precocious
and
so
this
man
has
helped
captain
falkenberg
out
of
a
mess
the
captain
was
sorry
for
it
now
no
doubt
anxious
to
free
himself
from
the
debt
that
was
why
he
was
cutting
down
his
timber
to
the
last
lot
of
battens
i
thought
and
i
wished
him
free
of
it
myself
i
was
sorry
now
i
had
not
stayed
on
marking
down
a
few
more
days
that
he
might
have
enough
and
to
spare
what
if
it
should
prove
too
little
after
all
engineer
lassen
was
a
wealthy
man
apparently
he
lived
at
an
hotel
and
had
two
rooms
there
i
never
got
farther
than
the
office
myself
but
even
there
he
had
a
lot
of
costly
things
books
and
papers
silver
things
for
the
gilt
instruments
and
things
a
light
overcoat
hung
on
the
wall
evidently
a
rich
man
and
a
person
of
importance
in
the
place
the
local
photographer
had
a
photograph
of
him
in
the
outside
i
saw
him
too
out
walking
in
the
afternoons
with
the
young
ladies
of
the
town
being
in
charge
of
all
the
timber
traffic
he
generally
walked
down
to
the
long
bridge
it
was
four
hundred
and
sixty
feet
across
the
foss
halted
there
and
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
river
just
by
the
bridge
piers
and
on
the
flat
rocks
below
them
was
where
the
logs
were
most
inclined
to
jam
and
he
kept
a
gang
of
lumbermen
regularly
at
hand
for
this
work
alone
standing
on
the
bridge
there
watching
the
men
at
work
among
the
logs
he
looked
like
an
admiral
on
board
a
ship
young
and
strong
with
power
to
command
the
ladies
with
him
stopped
willingly
and
stood
there
on
the
bridge
though
the
rush
of
water
was
often
enough
to
make
one
giddy
and
the
roar
of
it
was
such
that
they
had
to
put
their
heads
together
when
they
spoke
but
just
in
this
position
at
his
post
on
the
bridge
standing
there
and
turning
this
way
and
that
there
was
something
smallish
and
unhandsome
about
his
figure
his
sports
jacket
fitting
tightly
at
the
waist
seemed
to
pinch
and
showed
up
contours
behind
the
very
first
evening
after
he
given
me
my
orders
to
start
off
up
the
river
next
day
i
met
him
out
walking
with
two
ladies
at
sight
of
me
he
stopped
and
kept
his
companions
waiting
there
too
while
he
gave
me
the
same
instructions
all
over
again
just
as
well
i
happened
to
meet
you
he
said
you
start
off
early
then
tomorrow
morning
take
a
hooking
pole
with
you
and
clear
all
the
logs
you
can
manage
if
you
come
across
a
big
jam
mark
it
down
on
the
chart
you
got
a
copy
of
the
chart
have
you
and
keep
on
up
river
till
you
meet
another
man
coming
down
but
remember
to
mark
in
red
not
blue
and
let
me
see
how
well
you
can
a
man
i
got
to
work
under
me
he
explained
to
the
ladies
i
really
ca
be
bothered
running
up
and
down
all
the
so
serious
he
was
about
it
all
he
even
took
out
a
notebook
and
wrote
something
down
he
was
very
young
and
could
not
help
showing
off
a
little
with
two
fair
ladies
to
look
on
next
morning
i
got
away
early
it
was
light
at
four
and
by
that
time
i
was
a
good
way
up
the
river
i
carried
food
with
me
and
my
hooking
pole
which
is
like
a
really
no
young
growing
timber
here
as
on
captain
falkenberg
land
the
ground
was
stony
and
barren
covered
with
heather
and
pine
needles
for
miles
round
they
had
felled
too
freely
here
the
sawmills
had
taken
over
much
leaving
next
to
no
young
wood
it
was
a
melancholy
country
to
be
in
by
noon
i
had
cleared
a
few
small
jams
and
marked
down
a
big
one
then
i
had
my
meal
with
a
drink
of
water
from
the
river
a
bit
of
a
rest
and
i
went
on
again
on
till
the
evening
then
i
came
upon
a
big
jam
where
a
man
was
already
at
work
among
the
logs
this
was
the
man
i
had
been
told
to
look
out
for
i
did
not
go
straight
up
to
him
at
first
but
stopped
to
look
at
him
he
worked
very
cautiously
as
if
in
terror
of
his
life
he
was
even
afraid
of
getting
his
feet
wet
it
amused
me
to
watch
him
for
a
little
the
least
chance
of
being
carried
out
into
the
stream
on
a
loosened
log
was
enough
to
make
him
shift
at
once
at
last
i
went
up
close
and
looked
at
him
why
yes
it
was
my
old
friend
grindhusen
grindhusen
that
i
had
worked
with
as
a
young
man
at
skreia
my
partner
in
the
digging
of
a
certain
well
six
years
before
and
now
to
meet
him
here
we
gave
each
other
greeting
and
sat
down
on
the
logs
to
talk
asking
and
answering
questions
for
an
hour
or
more
then
it
was
too
late
to
get
any
more
done
that
day
we
got
up
and
went
back
a
little
way
up
the
river
where
grindhusen
had
a
bit
of
a
log
hut
we
crept
in
lit
a
fire
made
some
coffee
and
had
a
meal
then
going
outside
again
we
lit
our
pipes
and
lay
down
in
the
heather
grindhusen
had
aged
and
was
in
no
better
case
than
i
myself
he
did
not
care
to
think
of
the
gay
times
in
our
youth
when
we
had
danced
the
whole
night
through
he
it
was
that
had
once
been
as
a
wolf
among
the
girls
but
now
he
was
thoroughly
cowed
by
age
and
toil
and
had
not
even
a
smile
if
i
had
only
had
a
drop
of
spirits
with
me
it
might
have
livened
him
up
a
little
but
i
had
none
in
the
old
days
he
had
been
a
fellow
obstinate
as
could
be
now
he
was
and
stupid
ay
maybe
so
was
his
answer
to
everything
ay
you
right
he
would
say
not
that
he
meant
it
only
that
life
had
taught
him
to
seek
the
easiest
way
so
life
does
with
all
of
us
as
the
years
go
by
but
it
was
an
ill
thing
to
see
meeting
him
so
ay
he
got
along
somehow
he
said
but
he
was
not
the
man
he
used
to
be
he
been
troubled
with
gout
of
late
and
pains
in
the
chest
as
well
his
pains
in
the
chest
were
cardialgic
but
it
was
none
so
bad
as
long
as
he
the
work
here
for
engineer
lassen
he
knew
the
river
right
up
and
worked
here
all
spring
and
early
summer
in
his
hut
and
as
for
clothes
he
nothing
to
wear
out
save
breeches
and
blouse
all
the
year
round
had
a
bit
of
luck
though
last
year
he
said
suddenly
found
a
sheep
with
nobody
to
own
it
sheep
in
the
forest
up
that
way
he
said
pointing
he
had
meat
on
sundays
half
through
the
winter
off
that
sheep
then
he
his
folks
in
america
as
good
as
any
one
else
children
married
there
and
they
sent
him
a
little
to
help
the
first
year
or
so
but
now
they
stopped
it
was
close
on
two
years
now
since
he
heard
from
them
at
all
eyah
well
that
how
things
were
now
with
him
and
his
wife
and
getting
old
grindhusen
lapsed
into
thought
a
dull
rushing
sound
from
the
forest
and
the
river
like
millions
of
nothings
flowing
and
flowing
on
no
birds
here
no
creatures
hopping
about
but
if
i
turn
up
a
stone
i
may
find
some
insect
under
it
wonder
what
these
tiny
things
live
on
i
say
what
tiny
things
says
grindhusen
those
that
only
ants
and
it
a
sort
of
beetle
i
tell
him
put
one
on
the
grass
and
roll
a
stone
on
top
of
it
and
it
grindhusen
answers
ay
maybe
so
but
thinking
never
a
word
of
what
i
said
and
i
think
the
rest
to
myself
but
put
an
ant
there
under
the
stone
as
well
and
very
soon
there
be
no
beetle
left
and
the
rush
of
the
forest
and
river
goes
on
is
one
eternity
that
speaks
with
another
and
agrees
but
in
the
storms
and
in
thunder
they
are
at
war
ay
so
it
is
says
grindhusen
at
last
two
years
come
next
fourteenth
of
august
since
the
last
letter
came
there
was
a
smart
photograph
in
from
olea
it
was
that
lives
in
dakota
as
they
call
it
a
mighty
fine
photograph
it
was
but
i
never
got
it
sold
eyah
but
we
manage
somehow
please
the
lord
says
grindhusen
with
a
yawn
what
was
i
going
to
say
now
what
is
he
paying
for
the
work
i
do
but
grindhusen
looks
at
me
suspiciously
thinking
it
is
only
that
i
will
not
say
ay
well
is
all
the
same
to
me
he
says
i
was
only
to
please
him
i
try
to
guess
a
wage
i
dare
say
he
give
me
a
couple
of
kroner
a
day
or
perhaps
three
think
ay
dare
say
you
may
he
answers
enviously
two
kroner
all
i
get
and
i
an
old
hand
at
the
then
fancying
perhaps
i
may
go
telling
of
his
grumbling
he
starts
off
in
praise
of
engineer
lassen
saying
what
a
splendid
fellow
he
is
in
every
way
he
do
what
fair
by
me
that
i
know
trust
him
for
that
why
he
been
as
good
as
a
father
to
me
and
that
the
truth
it
sounds
quaint
indeed
to
hear
grindhusen
half
his
teeth
gone
with
age
talking
of
the
young
engineer
as
a
father
i
felt
pretty
sure
i
could
find
out
a
good
deal
about
my
new
employer
from
this
quarter
but
i
did
not
ask
he
did
say
anything
about
me
coming
down
into
town
asked
grindhusen
he
sends
up
for
me
now
and
again
and
when
i
get
there
it
not
for
anything
particular
only
wants
to
have
a
bit
of
a
chat
with
me
all
ay
a
fine
fellow
is
the
engineer
it
is
getting
late
grindhusen
yawns
again
creeps
into
the
hut
and
lies
down
next
morning
we
cleared
the
jam
come
up
with
me
my
way
a
bit
says
grindhusen
and
i
went
after
an
hour
walking
we
sighted
the
fields
and
buildings
of
a
hill
farm
up
among
the
trees
and
suddenly
i
recollect
the
sheep
grindhusen
had
found
was
it
up
this
way
you
found
that
sheep
i
ask
grindhusen
looks
at
me
here
no
that
was
ever
so
far
away
right
over
toward
but
trovatn
only
in
the
next
parish
is
it
yes
that
what
i
say
it
ever
so
far
away
from
but
now
grindhusen
does
not
care
to
have
my
company
farther
he
stops
and
thanks
me
for
coming
up
so
far
i
might
just
as
well
go
up
to
the
farm
with
him
and
i
say
so
but
grindhusen
it
seems
is
not
going
up
to
the
farm
at
all
he
never
did
and
i
just
have
an
easy
day
back
into
town
starting
now
so
i
turned
and
went
back
the
way
i
had
come
vi
it
was
no
sort
of
work
this
for
a
man
i
was
not
satisfied
nothing
but
walk
walk
up
and
down
the
river
clearing
a
few
logs
here
and
there
and
then
on
again
and
after
each
trip
back
to
my
in
the
town
all
this
time
i
had
but
one
man
to
talk
to
the
boots
or
porter
at
the
hotel
where
the
engineer
was
staying
he
was
a
burly
fellow
with
huge
fists
and
eyes
like
a
child
he
had
fallen
down
and
hurt
his
head
as
a
youngster
he
said
and
never
got
on
in
life
beyond
hauling
things
and
carrying
heavy
loads
i
had
a
talk
with
him
now
and
again
but
found
no
one
else
to
talk
to
in
the
town
that
little
town
when
the
river
is
high
a
mighty
roar
of
sound
goes
rushing
through
the
place
dividing
it
in
two
folk
live
in
their
little
wooden
houses
north
or
south
of
the
roar
and
manage
no
doubt
to
make
ends
meet
from
day
to
day
of
all
the
many
children
crossing
the
bridge
and
running
errands
to
the
shops
there
are
none
that
go
naked
probably
few
that
suffer
want
and
all
are
decent
looking
enough
and
here
are
big
tall
girls
the
quaintest
of
all
with
their
awkward
movements
and
their
laughter
and
their
earnest
occupation
with
their
own
little
affairs
now
and
again
they
stop
on
the
bridge
to
watch
the
lumbermen
at
work
among
the
logs
below
and
join
in
the
song
of
the
men
as
they
haul
and
then
they
giggle
and
nudge
one
another
and
go
on
but
there
are
no
birds
here
strange
that
there
should
be
no
birds
on
quiet
evenings
at
the
great
enclosed
pool
lies
there
with
its
deep
waters
unmoved
moths
and
midges
hover
above
it
the
trees
on
the
banks
are
reflected
there
but
there
are
no
birds
in
the
trees
perhaps
it
is
because
of
the
roar
of
the
water
that
drowns
all
other
sound
birds
can
not
thrive
there
where
none
can
hear
another
song
and
so
it
comes
about
that
the
only
winged
creatures
here
are
flies
and
moths
but
god
alone
knows
why
even
the
crows
and
common
birds
shun
us
and
our
town
every
small
town
has
its
daily
event
that
every
one
turns
out
for
and
as
for
that
the
big
towns
too
with
their
promenades
out
vestland
way
it
is
the
postpacket
living
in
vestland
it
hard
to
keep
away
from
the
quay
when
the
little
vessel
comes
in
here
in
this
inland
town
with
a
dozen
miles
or
more
to
the
sea
and
nothing
but
rocks
and
hills
all
about
here
we
have
the
river
has
the
water
risen
or
fallen
in
the
night
will
they
be
clearing
logs
from
the
booms
today
oh
we
are
all
so
interested
true
we
have
a
little
railway
as
well
but
that
count
for
much
the
line
ends
here
it
runs
as
far
as
it
can
go
and
then
stops
like
a
cork
in
a
bottle
and
there
something
cosy
and
pleasant
about
the
tiny
carriages
on
the
trains
but
folk
seem
ashamed
of
them
they
are
so
ridiculously
old
and
worse
for
wear
and
not
even
room
to
sit
upright
with
a
hat
on
not
but
what
we
other
things
besides
a
market
and
a
church
and
schools
and
post
office
and
all
and
then
there
the
sawmills
and
works
by
the
riverside
but
as
for
grocery
shops
and
stores
more
than
you
believe
we
so
many
things
altogether
i
am
a
stranger
here
myself
as
indeed
i
am
everywhere
yet
i
could
reckon
up
a
host
of
things
we
have
besides
the
river
was
the
town
a
big
place
once
upon
a
time
no
it
has
been
a
little
town
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
but
there
was
once
a
great
man
over
all
the
smaller
folk
one
who
rode
lordly
fashion
with
a
servant
behind
him
a
great
landowner
now
we
are
all
equal
saving
perhaps
with
engineer
lassen
this
inspector
of
rafting
sections
who
can
afford
two
rooms
at
his
hotel
i
have
nothing
to
do
and
find
myself
pondering
over
the
following
matter
here
is
a
big
house
somewhere
about
a
couple
of
hundred
years
old
the
house
of
the
wealthy
ole
olsen
ture
it
is
of
enormous
size
a
house
of
two
stories
the
length
of
a
whole
block
it
is
used
as
a
depot
now
in
the
days
when
that
house
was
built
there
was
no
lack
of
giant
timber
hereabouts
three
beams
together
make
the
height
of
a
man
and
the
wood
is
hard
as
iron
nothing
can
bite
on
it
and
inside
the
building
are
halls
and
cells
as
in
a
castle
here
ture
the
great
ruled
like
a
prince
in
his
day
but
times
changed
houses
were
made
not
only
big
not
only
to
live
in
for
shelter
from
cold
and
rain
but
also
to
look
on
with
pleasure
to
the
eye
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
stands
an
old
archaic
building
with
carefully
balanced
verandah
in
the
empire
style
pillars
fronton
and
all
it
is
not
faultless
but
handsome
all
the
same
it
stands
out
like
a
white
temple
on
the
green
hillside
one
other
house
i
have
seen
and
stopped
to
look
at
one
near
the
its
double
street
door
has
old
handles
and
carved
rococo
mirrors
but
the
frames
cannelated
in
the
style
of
louis
xvi
the
cartouche
above
the
doorway
bears
the
date
in
arabic
numerals
that
was
our
transition
period
here
so
there
were
folk
here
at
that
time
who
kept
in
touch
with
the
times
without
the
aid
of
steam
and
telegraph
but
later
on
again
houses
were
built
to
keep
off
rain
and
snow
and
nothing
else
they
were
neither
big
nor
beautiful
to
look
at
the
idea
was
to
put
up
some
sort
of
a
dwelling
swiss
fashion
a
place
to
keep
a
wife
and
children
in
and
that
was
all
and
we
learned
from
a
miserable
little
people
up
in
the
alps
a
people
that
throughout
its
history
has
never
been
or
done
anything
worth
speaking
of
we
learned
to
pay
no
heed
to
what
a
homestead
really
looked
like
as
long
as
it
met
with
the
approval
of
loafing
tourist
is
there
something
of
the
calm
and
beauty
of
a
temple
about
that
white
building
on
the
hillside
and
pray
the
use
of
it
if
there
is
and
the
great
big
house
that
dates
from
the
time
of
ole
olsen
ture
why
has
it
been
pulled
down
long
ago
there
would
be
room
for
a
score
of
cheap
dwellings
on
the
site
things
have
gone
downhill
gone
to
the
depths
and
now
the
little
can
rejoice
not
because
we
all
grown
equally
great
but
because
we
all
equally
small
is
our
affair
the
long
bridge
is
pleasant
to
walk
on
because
it
is
paved
with
planks
and
even
as
a
floor
all
the
young
ladies
can
walk
gracefully
here
and
the
bridge
is
light
and
open
at
the
sides
making
an
excellent
lookout
place
for
us
inquisitive
folk
down
on
the
raft
of
tangled
logs
the
men
are
shouting
as
they
strain
to
free
the
timber
that
has
caught
and
stuck
fast
among
the
rocks
and
boulders
in
the
stick
after
stick
comes
floating
down
and
joins
the
mass
already
gathered
the
jam
grows
and
grows
at
times
there
may
be
a
couple
of
hundred
dozen
balks
hung
up
at
one
spot
but
if
all
goes
well
the
gang
can
clear
the
jam
in
time
and
if
fate
will
have
it
ill
some
unlucky
lumberman
may
be
carried
down
as
well
down
the
rapids
to
his
death
there
are
ten
men
with
on
the
jam
all
more
or
less
wet
from
falling
in
the
foreman
points
out
the
log
next
to
be
freed
but
we
watching
from
the
bridge
can
see
now
and
again
that
all
the
gang
are
not
agreed
there
is
no
hearing
what
is
said
but
we
can
see
some
of
them
are
inclined
to
get
another
log
out
first
one
of
the
old
hands
protests
knowing
his
speech
as
i
do
i
fancy
i
can
hear
him
say
stubbornly
and
calmly
i
doubt
we
better
see
and
get
one
clear
ten
pairs
of
eyes
are
turned
towards
the
stick
he
has
chosen
tracing
the
lie
of
it
in
among
its
tangled
fellows
if
the
men
agree
ten
are
thrust
into
it
then
for
a
moment
the
poles
stand
out
from
the
log
like
the
strings
of
a
harp
a
mighty
from
the
gang
a
short
tense
haul
and
it
moves
a
trifle
forward
a
fresh
grip
another
shout
and
forward
again
it
is
like
watching
half
a
score
of
ants
about
a
twig
and
at
last
the
freed
log
slides
out
and
away
down
the
foss
but
there
are
logs
that
are
almost
immovable
and
often
it
is
just
one
of
the
worst
that
has
to
be
cleared
before
anything
else
can
be
done
then
the
men
spread
out
and
surround
it
fixing
their
hooks
wherever
they
can
get
a
sight
of
it
in
the
tangle
some
hauling
others
thrusting
outward
if
it
is
dry
they
splash
water
over
it
to
make
it
slippery
and
here
the
poles
are
nowise
regularly
set
like
but
lie
crosswise
at
all
angles
like
a
cobweb
sometimes
the
shouting
of
the
gang
can
be
heard
all
day
long
from
the
river
silenced
only
for
meals
ay
it
may
happen
that
it
goes
on
for
days
together
then
suddenly
a
new
sound
falls
on
the
ear
the
stroke
of
the
ax
some
devil
of
a
log
has
fixed
itself
so
cunningly
there
is
no
hauling
it
free
and
it
has
to
be
cut
through
it
does
not
take
many
strokes
to
do
it
for
the
pressure
on
it
already
is
enormous
soon
it
breaks
the
great
confused
mass
yields
and
begins
to
move
all
the
men
are
on
their
guard
now
holding
back
to
see
what
is
coming
next
if
the
part
they
are
standing
on
shows
signs
of
breaking
loose
they
must
leap
with
catlike
swiftness
to
a
safer
spot
their
calling
is
one
of
daily
and
hourly
peril
they
carry
their
lives
in
their
hands
but
the
little
town
is
a
living
death
it
is
pitiful
to
see
such
a
dead
place
trying
to
pretend
it
is
alive
it
is
the
same
with
bruges
the
great
city
of
the
past
and
with
many
cities
in
holland
in
south
germany
the
north
of
france
the
orient
standing
in
the
marketplace
of
such
a
town
one
can
not
but
think
once
once
upon
a
time
this
was
a
living
place
there
are
still
human
beings
walking
in
the
streets
strange
this
town
of
ours
is
hidden
away
shut
in
by
the
hills
and
yet
for
all
that
it
has
no
doubt
its
local
feminine
beauty
and
its
local
masculine
ambition
just
as
all
other
towns
only
it
is
such
a
queer
outlandish
life
that
is
lived
here
with
little
crooked
fingers
with
eyes
as
of
a
mouse
and
ears
filled
day
and
night
with
the
eternal
rushing
of
the
waters
a
beetle
on
its
way
in
the
heather
a
stub
of
yellow
grass
sticks
up
here
and
there
huge
trees
they
seem
to
the
beetle
eye
two
local
merchants
walk
across
the
bridge
going
to
the
post
no
doubt
they
have
this
very
day
decided
to
go
halves
in
a
whole
sheet
of
stamps
buying
them
all
at
once
for
the
sake
of
the
rebate
on
a
quantity
oh
those
local
tradesmen
each
day
they
hang
out
their
stocks
of
clothes
and
dress
their
windows
with
their
stuffs
and
goods
but
rarely
do
i
see
a
customer
go
in
i
thought
to
myself
at
first
but
there
must
surely
be
some
one
now
and
then
a
peasant
from
somewhere
up
the
valley
coming
into
town
and
i
was
right
i
saw
that
peasant
today
and
it
was
strange
and
pleasant
to
see
him
he
was
dressed
like
the
pictures
in
our
a
little
short
jacket
with
silver
buttons
and
grey
breeches
with
a
black
leather
seat
he
was
driving
a
tiny
little
haycart
with
a
tiny
little
horse
and
up
in
the
cart
was
a
little
cow
on
its
way
to
the
butcher
i
suppose
all
three
man
horse
and
cow
were
undersized
palaeolithic
figures
dwarf
creatures
from
the
underworld
on
a
visit
to
the
haunts
of
men
i
almost
looked
to
see
them
vanish
before
my
eyes
all
of
a
sudden
the
cow
in
its
lilliputian
cart
utters
a
throaty
roar
and
even
that
unromantic
sound
was
like
a
voice
from
another
world
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
come
upon
the
man
again
minus
horse
and
cow
he
is
wandering
round
among
the
shops
on
his
errands
i
follow
him
to
the
saddler
saddler
and
vogt
is
also
a
glazier
and
deals
in
leather
as
well
this
merchant
of
many
parts
offers
to
serve
me
first
but
i
explain
that
i
must
look
at
a
saddle
and
some
glass
and
a
trifle
of
leather
first
i
am
in
no
hurry
so
he
turns
to
the
elfin
countryman
the
two
are
old
acquaintances
so
here
you
come
to
town
ay
that
the
way
of
and
so
on
through
the
whole
rigmarole
wind
and
weather
and
the
state
of
the
roads
wife
and
children
getting
on
as
usual
season
and
crops
river
fallen
so
much
the
last
week
butchers
prices
hard
times
nowadays
etc
then
they
begin
trying
the
leather
pinching
and
feeling
and
bending
it
about
and
talking
it
over
and
when
at
last
a
strip
is
cut
off
and
weighed
the
mannikin
finds
it
a
marvel
sure
that
ever
it
could
weigh
so
much
reckon
it
at
a
round
figure
those
little
bits
of
weights
are
worth
counting
and
the
two
of
them
argue
and
split
over
this
for
a
good
solid
while
as
is
right
and
proper
when
at
last
it
comes
to
paying
for
the
goods
a
fantastic
leather
purse
is
brought
to
light
a
thing
out
of
a
fairy
tale
slowly
and
cautiously
the
heavy
fist
draws
forth
the
coins
one
after
another
both
parties
count
the
money
over
again
and
again
then
the
mannikin
closes
his
purse
with
an
anxious
movement
that
is
all
he
has
why
you
coin
and
paper
too
i
saw
a
note
in
nay
i
not
break
the
more
reckoning
and
arguing
a
long
business
this
each
gives
way
a
little
they
split
the
difference
and
the
deal
is
over
and
a
terrible
heap
to
pay
for
a
bit
of
leather
says
the
purchaser
and
the
dealer
answers
nay
you
got
it
at
a
bargain
but
do
forget
me
next
time
in
towards
evening
i
meet
the
mannikin
once
more
driving
home
again
after
his
venture
into
the
world
the
cow
has
been
left
behind
at
the
butcher
there
are
parcels
and
sacks
in
the
cart
but
the
little
man
himself
jogs
along
behind
the
leather
seat
of
his
breeches
stretching
to
a
triangle
at
every
step
and
whether
for
thoughtlessness
or
an
overweight
of
thought
after
all
these
doings
and
dealings
he
wears
a
strip
of
sole
leather
like
a
ring
about
one
arm
so
money
has
flowed
into
the
town
once
more
a
peasant
has
come
in
and
sold
his
cow
and
spent
the
price
of
it
again
in
goods
the
event
is
noticed
everywhere
at
once
the
town
three
lawyers
notice
it
the
three
little
local
papers
notice
it
money
is
circulating
more
freely
of
late
unproductive
but
it
helps
the
town
to
live
every
week
the
little
local
papers
advertise
town
properties
for
sale
every
week
a
list
is
issued
by
the
authorities
of
houses
to
be
sold
in
liquidation
of
the
unpaid
tax
what
then
ah
but
mark
how
many
properties
come
on
the
market
that
way
the
barren
rocky
valley
with
its
great
river
can
not
feed
this
moribund
town
a
cow
now
and
again
is
not
enough
and
so
it
is
that
the
properties
are
given
up
the
houses
the
dwellings
and
shelters
out
vestland
way
if
ever
a
house
in
one
of
the
little
towns
should
chance
to
come
up
for
sale
it
is
a
great
event
the
inhabitants
flock
together
on
the
quay
to
talk
it
over
here
in
our
little
town
beyond
all
hope
it
occasions
no
remark
when
another
wearied
hand
leaves
hold
of
what
it
had
my
turn
now
be
another
before
long
and
none
finds
it
worth
while
sorrowing
much
for
that
engineer
lassen
came
to
my
lodging
and
said
put
on
your
cap
and
come
with
me
to
the
station
to
fetch
a
no
said
i
i
not
going
to
do
not
going
to
no
there
a
porter
at
the
hotel
for
that
sort
of
thing
let
him
earn
the
it
was
quite
enough
the
engineer
was
very
young
he
looked
at
me
and
said
nothing
but
being
obstinate
by
nature
he
would
not
give
up
at
once
he
changed
his
tone
i
rather
have
you
he
said
i
a
reason
for
it
and
i
wish
you
that
a
different
matter
then
i
i
put
on
my
cap
and
i
am
ready
he
walks
on
ahead
and
i
follow
behind
ten
minutes
waiting
at
the
station
and
the
train
comes
in
it
consists
of
three
toy
carriages
and
a
few
passengers
tumble
out
in
the
rear
carriage
is
a
lady
trying
to
alight
the
engineer
hurries
to
assist
her
i
paid
no
great
heed
to
what
was
happening
the
lady
was
veiled
and
wore
gloves
a
light
coat
she
handed
to
her
escort
she
seemed
embarrassed
at
first
and
said
only
a
few
words
in
a
low
voice
but
he
was
quite
the
reverse
talking
loudly
and
freely
all
the
time
and
when
he
begged
her
to
take
off
her
veil
she
grew
bolder
and
did
as
he
said
do
you
know
me
now
she
said
and
suddenly
i
pricked
up
my
ears
it
was
fru
falkenberg
voice
i
turned
round
and
looked
her
in
the
face
it
is
no
easy
matter
to
be
old
and
done
with
and
behave
as
such
the
moment
i
realized
who
it
was
standing
there
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
my
self
and
how
to
stand
and
bow
with
ease
and
respect
now
i
had
among
my
possessions
a
blouse
and
breeches
of
brown
corduroy
such
as
labourers
wear
in
the
south
an
excellent
suit
and
new
but
alas
i
had
not
put
it
on
today
and
the
lack
of
it
at
that
moment
irked
me
i
was
at
the
thought
and
while
the
two
stood
there
talking
i
fell
to
wondering
why
the
engineer
had
wanted
me
so
particularly
to
come
with
him
to
the
station
could
it
be
for
the
matter
of
a
few
to
the
porter
or
was
it
to
show
off
with
a
servant
at
his
heels
or
had
he
thought
that
fruen
would
be
pleased
to
have
some
one
she
knew
in
attendance
if
the
last
then
he
was
greatly
mistaken
fruen
started
in
evident
displeasure
at
finding
me
here
where
she
had
thought
perhaps
to
be
safely
concealed
i
heard
the
engineer
say
i
got
a
man
here
he
take
your
luggage
down
have
you
the
ticket
but
i
made
no
sign
of
greeting
i
turned
away
and
afterwards
i
triumphed
over
him
in
my
miserable
soul
thinking
how
annoyed
she
would
be
with
him
for
his
want
of
tact
he
brought
up
with
him
a
man
who
had
been
in
her
employ
when
she
had
a
home
but
that
man
had
some
delicacy
of
feeling
he
turned
away
pretending
not
to
know
her
lord
knows
what
the
woman
found
to
run
after
in
this
youth
with
the
heavy
contours
behind
there
are
fewer
people
on
the
platform
now
the
little
toy
waggons
are
rolled
away
and
shunted
about
to
build
another
train
at
last
we
are
left
with
the
whole
place
to
ourselves
fruen
and
the
engineer
stand
talking
what
has
she
come
for
heaven
knows
young
lovelace
perhaps
has
had
a
spasm
of
longing
and
wants
her
again
or
is
she
come
of
her
own
accord
to
tell
him
what
has
happened
and
ask
his
advice
like
as
not
the
end
of
it
will
be
they
fix
things
up
and
get
married
some
day
hugo
lassen
is
of
course
a
chivalrous
gentleman
and
she
his
one
and
only
love
and
then
comes
the
time
when
she
should
walk
on
roses
and
live
happily
ever
after
no
really
it
would
never
do
he
exclaims
with
a
laugh
if
you
wo
be
my
aunt
then
you
have
to
be
my
whispers
fruen
ca
you
get
rid
of
that
man
there
whereupon
the
engineer
comes
up
to
me
with
the
luggage
receipt
in
his
hand
and
in
his
lordliest
manner
as
an
inspector
of
waterways
addressing
a
gang
of
lumbermen
he
says
bring
this
along
to
the
very
good
i
answered
touching
my
cap
i
carried
down
the
trunk
thinking
as
i
went
he
had
actually
invited
her
to
pass
as
his
aunt
visibly
older
she
might
be
than
he
still
here
again
he
had
shown
himself
wanting
in
tact
i
would
not
have
said
such
a
thing
myself
i
would
have
declared
to
all
and
sundry
behold
here
is
come
a
bright
angel
to
visit
king
hugo
see
how
young
and
beautiful
she
is
mark
the
slow
heavy
turn
of
her
grey
eyes
ay
a
weighty
glance
but
there
is
a
shimmer
of
in
her
hair
i
love
her
mark
her
too
when
she
speaks
a
mouth
good
and
fine
and
with
ever
and
again
a
little
helpless
look
and
smile
i
am
king
hugo
this
day
and
she
is
my
love
the
trunk
was
no
heavier
than
many
another
burden
but
there
were
bronzed
iron
bands
round
and
one
of
them
tore
a
hole
in
my
blouse
at
the
back
so
i
thanked
my
stars
i
had
not
worn
my
better
one
vii
some
days
passed
i
was
growing
tired
of
my
empty
occupation
which
consisted
in
doing
nothing
but
loaf
about
the
place
i
went
to
the
foreman
of
the
gang
and
asked
him
to
take
me
on
as
a
lumberman
but
he
refused
these
gentlemen
of
the
proletariat
think
a
good
deal
of
themselves
they
look
down
on
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
they
are
ever
on
the
move
going
from
one
waterway
to
another
drawing
their
wages
in
cash
and
spending
a
fair
part
of
the
same
in
drink
then
too
they
are
more
popular
among
the
girls
it
is
the
same
with
men
working
on
the
roads
or
railways
with
all
even
the
mechanic
is
looked
down
upon
and
as
for
the
he
is
a
very
slave
now
i
knew
i
could
be
pretty
sure
of
a
place
in
the
gang
any
day
if
i
cared
to
ask
the
engineer
but
in
the
first
place
i
had
no
wish
to
be
further
indebted
to
him
and
in
the
second
i
might
be
sure
that
if
i
did
my
friends
the
lumbermen
would
make
my
life
a
misery
until
i
had
gone
through
all
the
trouble
of
making
myself
respected
for
my
deserts
and
that
might
take
longer
than
i
cared
about
and
then
one
day
the
engineer
came
to
me
with
instructions
that
i
was
to
observe
with
care
he
spoke
politely
and
sensibly
this
time
we
had
no
rain
for
a
long
time
now
the
river
getting
steadily
lower
and
the
logs
are
piling
up
on
the
way
down
i
want
you
to
tell
the
man
above
and
the
one
below
to
be
extra
careful
about
their
work
just
now
and
you
yourself
of
course
will
do
the
we
sure
to
get
rain
before
long
i
said
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
that
may
be
he
answered
with
the
intense
earnestness
of
youth
but
i
must
act
all
the
same
as
if
there
were
never
to
be
rain
again
now
remember
every
word
i
said
i
ca
be
everywhere
at
once
myself
more
especially
now
that
i
a
i
answered
him
with
a
face
as
serious
as
his
own
that
i
would
do
my
very
best
so
i
was
still
bound
to
my
idling
occupation
after
all
and
wandered
up
and
down
the
river
as
before
with
my
and
my
rations
for
my
own
satisfaction
i
cleared
away
bigger
and
bigger
jams
unaided
sang
to
myself
as
if
i
were
a
whole
gang
and
worked
hard
enough
for
many
men
also
i
carried
the
new
instructions
to
grindhusen
and
frightened
him
properly
but
then
came
the
rain
and
now
the
sticks
went
dancing
down
through
channel
and
rapids
like
huge
pale
serpents
hurrying
hurrying
on
now
head
now
tail
in
air
easy
days
these
for
my
engineer
for
myself
i
was
ill
at
ease
in
the
town
and
in
my
lodging
there
i
had
a
little
room
to
myself
but
one
could
hear
every
sound
in
the
place
and
there
was
little
rest
or
comfort
moreover
i
found
myself
outdone
in
everything
by
the
young
lumbermen
who
lodged
there
i
patroled
the
regularly
those
days
though
there
was
little
or
nothing
for
me
to
do
there
i
would
steal
away
and
sit
in
hiding
under
an
rock
hugging
the
thought
of
how
i
was
old
and
forsaken
by
all
in
the
evenings
i
wrote
many
letters
to
people
i
knew
just
to
have
some
one
to
talk
to
but
i
did
not
send
the
letters
joyless
days
were
these
my
chief
pleasure
was
to
go
about
noticing
every
little
trifle
in
the
town
wherever
it
might
be
and
thinking
a
little
upon
each
but
was
my
engineer
so
free
from
care
i
began
to
doubt
it
why
was
he
no
longer
to
be
seen
out
early
and
late
with
this
new
cousin
of
his
he
would
even
stop
another
young
lady
on
the
bridge
and
pass
the
time
of
day
a
thing
he
had
not
done
this
fortnight
gone
i
had
seen
him
with
fru
falkenberg
once
or
twice
she
looked
so
young
and
prettily
dressed
and
happy
a
little
reckless
laughing
out
loud
that
what
it
like
when
a
woman
first
steps
aside
i
thought
to
myself
but
or
the
day
after
it
may
be
different
and
when
i
saw
her
again
later
on
i
was
annoyed
with
her
there
was
something
overbold
about
her
dress
and
manner
the
old
charm
and
sweetness
were
gone
where
was
the
tenderness
now
in
her
eyes
nothing
but
bravado
and
furiously
i
told
myself
that
her
eyes
shone
like
a
pair
of
lamps
at
the
door
of
a
music
hall
by
the
look
of
things
the
couple
had
begun
to
weary
of
each
other
since
he
had
taken
to
going
out
alone
and
she
spend
much
of
her
time
sitting
looking
out
of
the
window
in
the
hotel
and
this
no
doubt
was
why
stout
captain
bror
made
his
appearance
once
again
his
mission
was
perhaps
to
bring
jollity
and
mirth
to
others
besides
himself
and
this
jovial
lump
of
deformity
certainly
did
his
best
his
guffaws
of
laughter
rang
through
the
little
town
one
whole
night
long
then
his
leave
expired
and
he
had
to
go
back
to
drill
and
duty
fru
falkenberg
and
her
hugo
were
left
to
themselves
once
more
one
day
while
i
was
in
a
shop
i
heard
that
there
had
been
some
slight
difference
of
opinion
between
engineer
lassen
and
his
cousin
a
commercial
traveller
was
telling
the
shopkeeper
all
about
it
but
so
great
was
the
general
respect
for
the
wealthy
engineer
throughout
the
town
that
the
shopman
would
hardly
believe
the
story
and
questioned
the
doubtingly
it
must
have
been
in
fun
i
sure
did
you
hear
it
yourself
when
was
it
the
traveller
himself
did
not
dare
to
make
more
of
it
my
room
next
to
his
he
said
so
i
could
help
hearing
it
last
night
they
were
arguing
i
do
say
it
was
a
quarrel
lord
no
as
delicate
as
could
be
she
only
said
he
was
different
now
from
what
he
had
been
that
he
changed
somehow
and
he
said
it
was
his
fault
he
could
do
as
he
liked
here
in
town
then
she
asked
him
to
get
rid
of
somebody
she
did
like
one
of
his
men
a
lumberman
i
suppose
and
he
promised
he
well
there
you
are
just
nothing
at
all
said
the
shopkeeper
but
the
traveller
had
heard
more
i
fancy
than
he
cared
to
say
i
could
tell
as
much
by
his
looks
and
had
i
not
noticed
myself
how
the
engineer
had
changed
he
had
talked
out
loud
so
cheerfully
at
the
station
that
first
day
now
he
could
be
obstinately
silent
when
he
did
go
so
far
as
to
take
fruen
for
a
walk
down
to
the
bridge
i
could
see
well
enough
how
they
stood
looking
each
their
separate
ways
lord
god
in
heaven
but
love
is
a
fleeting
thing
all
went
well
enough
at
first
she
said
no
doubt
that
it
was
quite
a
nice
little
place
with
a
great
big
river
and
the
rapids
and
so
strange
to
hear
the
roar
of
the
waters
all
the
time
and
here
was
a
real
little
town
with
streets
and
people
in
and
then
you
here
too
and
he
of
course
would
answer
yes
and
you
oh
they
were
everything
to
each
other
at
first
but
then
they
grew
weary
of
good
things
they
took
too
much
took
love
in
handfuls
such
was
their
foolishness
and
more
and
more
clearly
he
realized
that
things
were
getting
awry
the
town
was
such
a
little
place
and
this
cousin
of
his
a
stranger
he
could
not
keep
on
being
her
attendant
squire
for
ever
no
they
must
ease
off
a
little
gradually
now
and
then
perhaps
only
occasionally
of
course
it
would
be
as
well
to
have
their
meals
at
different
times
if
not
some
of
those
commercial
travellers
would
be
getting
ideas
into
their
heads
about
the
loving
cousins
remember
in
a
little
place
like
this
and
she
how
she
understand
it
a
little
place
yes
but
surely
it
was
no
smaller
now
than
it
had
been
at
first
no
no
my
friend
it
is
you
that
have
changed
there
had
been
plenty
of
rain
and
the
timber
was
coming
down
beautifully
nevertheless
the
engineer
took
to
going
off
on
little
trips
up
or
down
the
river
it
seemed
as
if
he
were
glad
to
get
away
he
looked
worried
and
miserable
altogether
now
one
day
he
asked
me
to
go
up
and
tell
grindhusen
to
come
in
to
town
was
it
grindhusen
i
wondered
that
was
to
be
dismissed
but
fruen
had
never
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
grindhusen
since
she
came
what
could
he
have
done
to
offend
her
i
fetched
grindhusen
in
accordingly
he
went
up
to
the
hotel
at
once
to
report
and
the
engineer
put
on
his
things
and
went
out
with
him
they
set
out
up
the
river
and
disappeared
later
in
the
day
grindhusen
came
to
my
lodging
and
was
ready
enough
to
tell
but
i
asked
him
nothing
in
the
evening
the
lumberman
gave
him
and
the
spirit
loosened
his
tongue
what
about
this
cousin
or
something
engineer
has
got
with
him
how
much
longer
was
she
going
to
stay
as
to
this
nobody
could
say
and
anyhow
why
she
stay
is
naught
but
fooling
and
trouble
with
cousin
business
grindhusen
declared
why
could
he
bring
along
the
girl
he
going
to
marry
and
i
told
him
so
to
his
you
told
him
asked
one
of
the
men
ay
i
did
that
you
may
not
know
it
but
engineer
and
i
we
sit
there
talking
as
it
might
be
me
and
you
said
grindhusen
looking
mighty
big
and
proud
what
do
you
suppose
he
sent
to
fetch
me
for
you
never
guess
if
you
sat
there
all
night
why
he
sent
for
me
just
to
have
a
talk
over
things
not
that
there
anything
new
or
strange
about
that
he
done
the
same
before
now
but
anyhow
that
what
it
what
he
want
to
talk
to
you
about
asked
one
grindhusen
swelled
and
was
not
to
be
drawn
at
once
eh
i
not
such
a
fool
but
i
know
how
to
talk
with
a
man
and
it
not
my
way
to
be
contrary
neither
know
a
thing
or
two
grindhusen
says
the
inspector
there
two
kroner
for
you
says
he
ay
that
what
he
said
and
if
you
do
believe
me
why
here
the
money
and
you
can
see
there
but
what
was
it
all
about
asked
several
voices
at
once
he
better
not
say
if
you
ask
me
i
said
it
struck
me
that
the
engineer
must
have
been
miserable
and
desperate
when
he
sent
me
to
fetch
grindhusen
he
was
so
little
used
to
trouble
that
the
moment
anything
went
wrong
he
felt
the
need
of
some
one
to
confide
in
and
now
when
he
was
going
about
day
after
day
thoroughly
disheartened
and
full
of
pity
for
himself
as
if
he
wanted
to
know
how
miserable
he
was
at
being
checked
in
his
play
this
sportsman
with
his
figure
moulded
in
the
wrong
place
was
a
travesty
of
youth
a
spartan
in
tears
what
sort
of
upbringing
could
his
have
been
ah
well
if
he
had
been
an
old
man
i
had
found
reason
and
excuse
for
him
enough
if
the
truth
were
known
it
was
perhaps
but
hatred
of
his
youth
that
moved
me
now
who
can
say
but
i
know
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
travesty
a
caricature
grindhusen
stared
at
me
when
i
had
spoken
my
few
words
the
others
too
looked
wonderingly
i
not
say
but
it
might
be
better
not
said
grindhusen
submissively
but
the
men
were
not
to
be
put
off
and
why
should
he
tell
we
not
going
to
let
it
go
no
that
we
sha
said
another
but
you
might
be
one
of
that
sort
yourself
and
go
telling
tales
to
the
grindhusen
took
courage
at
this
and
said
i
say
what
i
like
so
do
you
trouble
yourself
tell
just
as
much
as
i
please
for
i
saying
no
more
than
true
and
in
case
you
care
to
know
i
can
tell
you
the
inspector
got
a
word
to
say
to
you
very
soon
ay
that
he
has
or
hearing
goes
for
nothing
so
you
no
call
to
be
anyway
stuck
up
yourself
and
as
for
me
telling
or
not
telling
things
i
saying
never
a
thing
but
what
the
truth
just
remember
that
and
if
you
knew
as
much
as
i
do
she
nothing
but
a
plague
and
a
burden
to
him
all
the
time
and
wo
let
him
out
of
her
sight
call
that
cousins
going
on
like
that
nay
surely
nay
surely
said
the
men
encouragingly
what
think
he
sent
for
me
about
ay
there
the
pretty
fellow
he
sent
up
with
the
message
but
there
be
a
message
for
him
one
of
these
days
i
gathered
as
much
from
the
inspector
himself
i
say
no
more
than
that
and
as
for
me
telling
things
here
inspector
been
like
a
father
to
me
and
i
be
a
stock
and
a
stone
to
say
otherwise
all
upset
and
worried
these
days
grindhusen
says
he
to
me
what
a
man
to
do
can
you
tell
me
that
now
says
i
inspector
knows
himself
says
i
those
very
words
i
said
wish
to
heaven
i
did
says
he
again
it
all
these
wretched
women
says
he
women
says
i
there
no
doing
anything
with
them
says
i
indeed
you
right
there
says
he
only
way
to
give
them
what
they
were
made
for
and
a
good
round
slap
on
the
backside
into
the
bargain
says
i
heaven
i
believe
you
right
there
grindhusen
says
the
inspector
and
he
brightened
up
no
end
i
never
seen
a
man
so
brightened
up
and
cheerful
just
for
a
word
or
so
it
was
a
sight
to
see
and
you
can
take
and
drown
me
if
it
is
gospel
truth
every
single
bit
i
said
i
sat
there
just
as
i
sitting
now
and
inspector
as
it
might
be
there
and
grindhusen
rambled
on
next
morning
early
before
it
was
fairly
light
engineer
lassen
stopped
me
on
the
street
it
was
only
three
i
was
all
fitted
out
for
a
tramp
up
the
river
with
my
and
a
store
of
food
grindhusen
was
having
a
in
town
and
i
was
going
to
do
his
beat
as
well
as
my
own
that
would
take
me
right
up
to
the
top
of
the
hills
and
i
had
packed
a
double
stock
of
food
accordingly
the
engineer
was
evidently
coming
down
from
a
party
somewhere
he
was
laughing
and
talking
loudly
with
a
couple
of
other
men
all
of
them
more
or
less
drunk
go
on
ahead
a
bit
he
said
to
the
others
and
then
turning
to
me
he
asked
where
are
you
off
to
i
told
him
what
i
had
in
mind
h
i
do
know
about
that
said
he
no
i
think
you
better
not
grindhusen
can
manage
all
right
by
himself
and
besides
i
going
to
inspect
myself
you
no
business
to
go
off
doing
things
like
that
without
asking
me
well
he
was
right
of
course
so
far
as
that
went
and
i
begged
his
pardon
and
indeed
knowing
as
i
did
how
he
was
set
on
playing
the
master
and
lording
it
over
his
men
i
might
have
had
more
sense
but
begging
his
pardon
only
seemed
to
egg
him
on
he
felt
deeply
injured
and
grew
quite
excited
over
it
i
have
no
more
of
this
he
said
my
men
are
here
to
carry
out
my
orders
that
all
they
got
to
do
i
took
you
on
to
give
you
a
chance
not
because
i
any
use
for
you
myself
and
i
no
use
for
you
now
i
stood
there
staring
at
him
and
said
never
a
word
you
can
come
round
to
the
office
today
and
get
your
wages
he
went
on
and
then
he
turned
to
go
so
i
was
the
one
to
be
dismissed
now
i
understood
what
grindhusen
had
meant
with
his
hints
about
me
fru
falkenberg
no
doubt
had
come
to
hate
the
sight
of
me
by
now
reminding
her
as
it
must
of
her
home
and
so
she
had
got
him
to
turn
me
off
but
had
i
been
the
very
one
to
show
delicacy
of
feeling
towards
her
at
the
station
turning
away
instead
of
recognizing
her
had
i
ever
so
much
as
lifted
my
cap
to
her
when
i
passed
her
in
the
street
surely
i
had
been
considerate
enough
to
deserve
consideration
in
return
and
now
here
was
this
young
engineer
turning
me
off
at
a
notice
and
that
with
unnecessary
vehemence
i
saw
it
all
in
my
mind
he
had
been
worrying
himself
for
days
over
this
dismissal
shirking
it
all
the
time
until
at
last
he
managed
to
screw
his
courage
up
by
drinking
hard
all
night
was
i
doing
him
an
injustice
it
might
be
so
and
i
tried
to
combat
the
thought
myself
once
more
i
called
to
mind
that
he
was
young
and
i
was
old
and
my
heart
no
doubt
full
of
envy
on
that
account
so
i
gave
him
no
sarcastic
answer
now
but
simply
said
ay
well
then
i
can
unpack
the
things
i
was
taking
but
the
engineer
was
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
his
chance
now
he
was
fairly
started
he
dragged
in
the
old
story
about
the
time
he
wanted
me
to
go
and
fetch
a
trunk
when
i
give
an
order
i
do
expect
the
man
to
turn
round
and
say
no
he
wo
i
not
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
and
as
there
no
knowing
it
may
not
occur
again
you
better
well
and
good
said
i
saw
a
figure
in
a
white
dress
at
a
window
in
the
hotel
and
fancied
it
must
be
fru
falkenberg
watching
us
so
i
said
no
more
but
then
the
engineer
seemed
suddenly
to
remember
that
he
could
get
rid
of
me
once
and
for
all
on
the
spot
he
would
have
to
see
me
again
to
settle
up
so
he
changed
his
tone
and
said
well
anyhow
come
up
sometime
and
get
your
money
have
you
thought
over
how
much
it
ought
to
be
no
that
be
for
engineer
himself
to
well
well
he
said
in
a
kindlier
voice
after
all
you
been
a
good
man
to
have
i
will
say
that
for
you
but
for
various
reasons
and
it
not
only
for
myself
you
know
what
women
that
is
i
mean
the
ladies
oh
but
he
was
young
indeed
he
stopped
at
nothing
well
good
morning
he
nodded
abruptly
and
turned
away
but
the
day
proved
all
too
short
for
me
i
went
up
into
the
woods
and
stayed
roaming
about
there
all
by
myself
so
long
that
i
did
get
to
the
office
to
draw
my
money
well
there
was
no
hurry
i
had
plenty
of
time
what
was
i
to
do
now
i
had
not
cared
much
for
the
little
town
before
but
now
it
began
to
interest
me
i
would
gladly
have
stayed
on
a
while
there
were
complications
arising
between
two
people
whom
i
had
been
following
attentively
for
some
weeks
past
something
fresh
might
happen
any
moment
now
there
was
no
saying
i
thought
of
going
as
apprentice
to
a
blacksmith
just
for
the
sake
of
staying
in
the
place
but
then
if
i
did
i
should
be
tied
to
the
smithy
all
day
and
hampered
in
my
movements
altogether
apart
from
which
the
apprenticeship
would
take
too
many
years
of
my
life
and
years
were
the
thing
i
least
of
all
could
spare
so
i
let
the
days
pass
one
after
another
the
weather
changed
round
again
to
dry
sunny
days
i
stayed
on
at
the
mended
my
clothes
and
got
some
new
ones
made
at
a
shop
one
of
the
maids
in
the
house
came
up
one
evening
and
offered
to
do
some
mending
for
me
but
i
was
more
in
the
mood
for
fooling
and
showed
her
how
well
i
managed
the
work
myself
look
at
that
patch
there
now
and
that
after
a
while
a
man
came
up
the
stairs
and
tried
the
door
open
you
within
he
said
it
henrik
one
of
the
lumbermen
said
the
girl
is
he
your
sweetheart
i
asked
no
indeed
i
should
think
not
she
answered
i
rather
go
without
than
have
a
fellow
like
open
the
door
hear
cried
the
man
outside
but
the
girl
was
not
frightened
in
the
least
let
him
stay
outside
she
said
and
we
let
him
stay
outside
but
that
door
of
mine
bent
inwards
in
a
great
curve
every
now
and
then
when
he
pushed
his
hardest
at
last
when
we
finished
making
fun
about
my
needlework
and
her
sweethearts
i
had
to
go
out
and
see
the
passage
was
clear
before
she
would
venture
downstairs
but
there
was
no
man
there
it
was
late
now
i
went
down
to
the
parlour
for
a
bit
and
there
was
grindhusen
drinking
with
some
of
the
gang
there
he
is
said
one
of
them
as
i
came
in
it
was
henrik
who
spoke
he
was
trying
to
get
his
mates
against
me
grindhusen
too
sided
with
the
rest
of
them
and
tried
all
he
could
to
annoy
me
poor
grindhusen
he
was
all
the
time
now
and
could
get
clear
of
it
he
had
had
another
meeting
with
engineer
lassen
they
had
walked
up
the
river
as
before
and
sat
talking
for
an
hour
and
when
grindhusen
came
back
he
showed
a
new
piece
he
got
then
he
went
on
the
drink
again
and
gabbled
about
being
in
the
confidence
this
evening
too
he
was
all
not
to
be
outdone
by
anybody
come
in
and
sit
down
he
said
to
me
but
one
or
two
of
the
other
men
demurred
they
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
and
at
this
grindhusen
changed
front
for
sheer
devilment
he
fell
to
again
about
the
engineer
and
his
cousin
knowing
it
would
annoy
me
well
has
he
turned
you
off
he
asked
with
a
side
glance
at
the
others
as
if
to
bid
them
watch
what
was
coming
yes
said
i
aha
i
knew
all
about
it
days
ago
but
i
never
said
a
word
i
mind
saying
i
knew
about
it
before
any
other
single
soul
in
the
world
of
us
here
but
did
i
ever
breathe
a
word
of
it
inspector
he
says
to
me
want
to
ask
you
something
grindhusen
says
he
that
is
if
you
come
down
and
work
in
the
town
instead
of
the
man
i
got
there
now
i
want
to
get
rid
of
him
says
he
as
to
that
says
i
just
as
inspector
pleased
to
command
that
was
my
very
words
and
neither
more
nor
less
but
did
i
ever
breathe
a
syllable
has
he
turned
you
off
asked
one
of
the
other
men
then
yes
i
answered
but
as
for
that
cousin
of
his
grindhusen
went
on
he
asked
me
about
her
too
ay
inspector
he
asks
my
advice
about
all
sorts
of
things
and
now
this
last
time
we
were
up
the
river
together
he
slapped
his
knee
when
he
talked
of
her
so
there
and
you
can
guess
for
yourselves
till
tomorrow
morning
if
you
like
everything
of
the
best
to
eat
and
drink
and
every
way
and
costing
a
heap
of
money
each
week
but
she
stays
on
and
on
fie
and
for
shame
say
i
and
i
mean
it
but
now
it
seemed
as
if
the
scale
had
turned
in
my
favour
at
the
news
of
my
dismissal
some
of
the
men
perhaps
felt
sorry
for
me
others
were
glad
to
learn
that
i
was
going
one
of
them
offered
me
a
drink
from
his
own
bottle
and
called
to
the
maid
for
another
glass
a
clean
one
you
understand
even
henrik
no
longer
bore
me
any
grudge
but
drank
with
me
and
was
friendly
enough
and
we
sat
there
gossiping
over
our
glasses
quite
a
while
but
you
better
go
up
and
see
about
that
money
of
yours
said
grindhusen
for
from
what
i
heard
i
do
fancy
you
get
the
inspector
to
come
down
here
with
it
after
you
he
said
as
much
money
owing
to
him
that
was
what
he
said
if
he
thinks
i
going
to
run
after
him
with
it
you
can
tell
him
it
here
he
viii
but
the
engineer
did
come
down
after
me
as
it
turned
out
though
it
was
queer
it
should
be
so
anyhow
it
was
a
triumph
i
had
not
sought
and
i
cared
nothing
for
it
he
came
to
the
to
see
me
and
said
i
want
you
to
come
back
with
me
if
you
please
and
get
your
money
and
there
a
letter
come
for
you
by
the
when
we
stepped
into
the
office
fru
falkenberg
was
there
i
was
taken
aback
at
finding
her
there
i
made
a
bow
and
stood
over
by
the
door
sit
down
wo
you
said
the
engineer
going
to
the
table
for
my
letter
here
you
are
no
sit
down
and
read
your
letter
while
reckoning
up
your
and
fru
falkenberg
herself
motioned
me
to
a
chair
now
what
were
they
looking
so
anxious
about
and
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
politeness
and
wo
you
sit
down
and
all
the
rest
i
had
not
to
wait
long
to
find
out
the
letter
was
from
captain
falkenberg
here
you
can
use
this
said
fruen
very
obligingly
handing
me
a
a
simple
ordinary
letter
nothing
more
indeed
it
began
almost
jestingly
i
had
run
away
from
øvrebø
before
he
knew
i
was
going
and
had
even
waited
for
my
money
if
i
imagined
he
was
in
difficulties
and
would
not
be
able
to
pay
me
before
the
harvest
was
in
if
that
was
why
i
had
left
in
such
a
hurry
why
he
hoped
i
had
found
out
i
was
mistaken
and
now
he
would
be
very
glad
if
i
would
come
back
and
work
for
him
if
i
was
fixed
up
elsewhere
the
house
and
outbuildings
wanted
painting
then
there
would
be
the
harvesting
and
after
that
he
would
like
to
have
me
for
work
among
the
timber
everything
looking
well
here
fields
nice
and
tall
meadows
nice
and
thick
glad
to
hear
as
soon
as
you
can
in
answer
to
this
yours
falkenberg
the
engineer
had
finished
his
reckoning
he
turned
on
his
chair
and
looked
over
at
the
wall
then
as
if
suddenly
remembering
something
he
turned
sharply
to
the
table
again
nervousness
that
was
all
fruen
stood
looking
at
her
rings
but
i
had
a
feeling
she
was
stealthily
watching
me
all
the
time
thoroughly
nervous
the
pair
of
them
then
said
the
engineer
oh
by
the
way
i
noticed
your
letter
was
from
captain
falkenberg
how
are
things
going
there
i
knew
the
writing
at
would
you
like
to
read
the
letter
i
said
promptly
offering
it
as
i
spoke
no
oh
no
thanks
all
the
same
not
in
the
least
i
was
only
but
he
took
the
letter
all
the
same
and
fruen
came
across
to
him
and
stood
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
he
read
h
said
the
engineer
with
a
nod
everything
going
on
nicely
it
seems
and
he
held
out
the
letter
to
give
it
back
fruen
manner
was
different
she
took
the
letter
from
him
and
began
studying
it
herself
her
hand
shook
a
little
well
now
about
the
money
said
the
engineer
here
you
are
what
i
make
it
i
hope
you
satisfied
all
right
yes
thank
you
said
i
he
seemed
relieved
to
find
that
captain
falkenberg
letter
was
only
about
myself
and
made
no
mention
of
anyone
else
and
again
he
tried
to
soften
down
my
dismissal
well
well
he
said
but
if
you
should
happen
to
be
in
these
parts
any
time
you
know
where
to
find
me
we
all
but
finished
now
for
this
year
there
been
too
much
drought
just
fruen
was
still
holding
the
letter
then
i
saw
she
had
finished
reading
for
her
eyes
never
moved
but
she
stood
there
staring
at
the
letter
thinking
what
was
in
her
mind
i
wondered
the
engineer
glanced
at
her
impatiently
are
you
learning
it
by
heart
he
said
with
a
come
dear
he
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
fruen
quickly
i
and
she
handed
me
the
letter
so
it
seems
observed
the
engineer
i
bowed
and
went
out
on
a
summer
evening
the
bridge
is
crowded
with
people
out
walking
school
teachers
and
tradespeople
young
girls
and
children
i
watch
my
time
when
it
is
getting
late
and
the
bridge
is
deserted
then
i
can
lounge
over
that
way
myself
and
stay
for
an
hour
or
so
in
the
midst
of
the
roar
no
need
to
do
anything
really
but
listen
only
my
brain
is
so
with
idleness
and
good
sound
sleep
it
finds
no
end
of
things
to
busy
itself
about
last
evening
i
determined
in
all
seriousness
to
go
to
fru
falkenberg
and
say
go
away
from
here
frue
leave
by
the
first
train
that
today
i
have
been
calling
myself
a
fool
for
entertaining
such
a
ridiculous
thought
and
set
in
its
place
another
get
out
of
this
yourself
my
good
man
by
the
first
train
that
goes
are
you
her
equal
her
adviser
very
well
then
see
that
what
you
do
is
not
too
utterly
at
variance
with
what
you
are
and
this
evening
i
am
still
treating
myself
as
i
deserve
i
fall
to
humming
a
little
tune
but
can
scarcely
hear
it
myself
the
sound
is
crushed
to
death
in
the
roar
of
the
water
that
right
i
say
to
myself
scornfully
you
ought
always
to
stand
by
a
deafening
foss
when
you
feel
like
humming
a
and
i
laugh
at
myself
again
with
suchlike
childish
fancies
do
i
pass
the
time
the
noise
of
the
rapids
anywhere
inland
is
as
useful
to
the
ear
as
the
noise
of
breakers
on
the
shore
but
the
voice
of
the
breakers
is
louder
and
fainter
by
turns
the
roar
of
waters
in
a
is
like
an
audible
fog
a
monotony
of
sound
beyond
reason
contrary
to
all
sense
a
miracle
of
idiocy
what
is
the
time
do
you
know
yes
is
it
day
or
night
yes
as
if
some
one
had
laid
a
stone
on
six
keys
of
an
organ
and
walked
off
and
left
it
there
with
such
childish
fancies
do
i
while
away
the
time
says
fru
falkenberg
and
there
she
is
beside
me
i
hardly
felt
surprised
it
was
almost
as
if
i
had
expected
her
after
her
behaviour
with
her
husband
letter
she
might
well
go
a
little
farther
now
i
could
think
two
ways
about
her
coming
either
she
had
turned
thoroughly
sentimental
at
being
reminded
so
directly
of
her
home
once
more
or
she
wanted
to
make
her
engineer
jealous
he
might
perhaps
be
watching
us
from
his
window
that
very
moment
and
i
had
been
sent
for
to
go
back
to
øvrebø
possibly
she
was
thoroughly
calculating
and
had
been
trying
to
work
on
his
jealousy
even
yesterday
when
she
studied
the
letter
so
attentively
it
seemed
however
that
none
of
my
clever
theories
was
to
be
confirmed
it
was
me
she
wanted
to
see
and
that
only
to
make
a
sort
of
apology
for
getting
me
dismissed
that
she
should
ever
care
about
such
a
trifle
was
she
so
incapable
of
thinking
seriously
that
she
could
not
see
what
a
miserable
position
she
herself
was
in
what
in
the
devil
name
had
she
to
do
with
my
affairs
i
had
thought
to
say
a
brief
word
or
so
and
point
to
the
train
but
something
made
me
gentle
as
if
i
were
dealing
with
an
irresponsible
a
child
you
be
going
back
to
øvrebø
now
i
suppose
she
said
and
i
thought
i
like
h
you
sorry
to
be
leaving
here
perhaps
no
no
no
of
course
not
but
i
must
tell
you
something
it
was
i
that
got
you
it
does
no
no
only
i
wanted
to
tell
you
now
that
you
going
back
to
øvrebø
you
can
understand
it
was
a
little
unpleasant
for
me
at
times
to
she
checked
herself
to
have
me
about
the
place
yes
it
would
be
to
see
you
here
a
unpleasant
i
mean
because
you
knew
about
me
before
so
i
asked
the
engineer
if
he
could
send
you
away
not
that
he
wanted
to
himself
you
understand
quite
the
reverse
in
fact
but
he
did
at
last
i
glad
you
going
back
to
so
said
i
but
when
fruen
comes
home
again
surely
it
will
be
just
as
unpleasant
to
see
me
then
home
she
repeated
i
not
going
pause
she
had
frowned
as
she
spoke
but
now
she
nodded
and
even
smiled
a
little
and
turned
to
go
well
well
you
pardon
me
then
i
know
she
said
have
you
any
objection
to
my
going
back
to
captain
falkenberg
i
asked
she
stopped
and
looked
me
full
in
the
face
now
what
was
the
right
thing
here
three
times
she
had
spoken
of
øvrebø
was
it
with
the
idea
that
i
might
put
in
a
word
for
her
if
opportunity
offered
when
i
got
back
there
or
was
she
unwilling
to
ask
of
me
as
a
favour
not
to
go
no
no
indeed
i
not
she
answered
go
there
by
all
and
she
turned
and
left
me
neither
sentimental
nor
calculating
as
far
as
i
could
see
but
she
might
well
have
been
both
and
what
had
i
gained
by
my
attempt
at
a
confidential
tone
i
should
have
known
better
than
to
try
whether
she
stayed
here
or
went
elsewhere
what
business
was
it
of
mine
was
her
affair
you
playing
and
pretending
i
said
to
myself
all
very
well
to
say
she
literature
and
no
more
but
that
withered
soul
of
yours
showed
good
signs
of
life
when
she
was
kind
to
you
and
began
looking
at
you
with
those
two
eyes
of
hers
i
disappointed
i
ashamed
of
you
and
you
go
but
i
did
not
go
and
true
it
is
that
i
went
about
spying
and
listening
everywhere
for
anything
i
could
learn
of
fru
falkenberg
and
then
at
times
ay
many
a
night
i
would
call
myself
to
account
for
that
same
thing
and
torture
myself
with
from
early
morning
i
thought
of
her
is
she
awake
yet
has
she
slept
well
will
she
be
going
back
home
and
at
the
same
time
all
sorts
of
ideas
came
into
my
head
i
might
perhaps
get
work
at
the
hotel
where
she
was
staying
or
i
might
write
home
for
some
clothes
turn
gentleman
myself
and
go
and
stay
at
that
same
hotel
this
last
of
course
would
at
once
have
cut
the
ground
from
under
my
feet
and
left
me
farther
removed
from
her
than
ever
but
it
was
the
one
that
appealed
to
me
most
of
all
fool
that
i
was
i
had
begun
to
make
friends
with
the
hotel
porter
already
merely
because
he
lived
nearer
to
her
than
i
he
was
a
big
strong
fellow
who
went
up
to
the
station
every
day
to
meet
the
trains
and
pick
up
a
commercial
traveller
once
a
fortnight
he
could
give
me
no
news
i
did
not
ply
him
with
questions
nor
even
lead
him
on
to
tell
me
things
of
his
own
accord
and
besides
he
was
far
from
intelligent
but
he
lived
under
the
same
roof
with
fruen
ah
yes
that
he
did
and
one
day
it
came
about
that
this
acquaintance
of
mine
with
the
hotel
porter
brought
me
a
piece
of
valuable
information
about
fru
falkenberg
and
that
from
her
own
lips
so
they
were
not
all
equally
fruitless
those
days
in
the
little
town
one
morning
i
came
back
with
the
porter
from
the
station
he
had
picked
up
a
traveller
with
a
heap
of
luggage
and
had
to
take
horse
and
cart
to
fetch
the
heavy
grey
trunks
i
had
helped
him
to
get
them
loaded
up
at
the
station
and
now
as
we
pulled
up
at
the
hotel
he
said
you
might
lend
a
hand
getting
these
things
in
i
stand
you
a
bottle
of
beer
this
so
we
carried
in
the
trunks
together
they
were
to
be
taken
up
at
once
to
the
big
upstairs
the
owner
was
waiting
for
them
it
was
an
easy
job
for
the
two
of
us
big
strong
fellows
both
we
had
got
them
up
all
but
one
that
was
still
in
the
cart
when
the
porter
was
called
back
upstairs
the
traveller
was
giving
him
instructions
about
something
or
other
meantime
i
went
out
and
waited
in
the
passage
i
did
not
belong
to
the
place
and
did
not
want
to
be
seen
hanging
about
on
the
stairs
by
myself
just
then
the
door
of
engineer
lassen
office
opened
and
he
and
fru
falkenberg
came
out
they
looked
as
if
they
had
just
got
up
they
had
no
hats
on
just
going
down
to
breakfast
no
doubt
now
whether
they
did
not
notice
me
or
took
me
for
the
porter
standing
there
they
went
on
with
what
they
had
been
saying
quite
so
says
the
engineer
and
it
wo
be
any
different
i
see
what
you
got
to
feel
lonely
oh
you
know
well
enough
she
answered
no
i
do
and
i
do
think
you
might
be
a
little
more
you
would
like
it
if
i
were
you
rather
have
me
stay
as
i
am
miserable
and
wretched
because
you
do
care
for
me
any
he
stopped
on
the
stairs
abruptly
really
i
think
you
must
be
mad
he
said
i
dare
say
i
am
she
answered
how
poorly
she
held
her
own
in
a
quarrel
it
was
always
so
with
her
why
could
she
not
be
careful
of
her
words
and
answer
so
as
to
wound
him
crush
him
altogether
he
stood
with
one
hand
on
the
and
said
so
you
think
it
pleases
me
to
have
things
going
on
like
this
i
tell
you
it
hurts
me
desperately
has
done
for
a
long
time
and
me
she
answered
but
now
i
have
no
more
of
oh
indeed
you
said
that
before
you
said
it
only
a
week
well
i
am
going
he
looked
up
at
her
going
away
yes
very
but
he
saw
that
he
had
betrayed
himself
in
grasping
so
eagerly
delightedly
at
the
suggestion
and
tried
now
to
smooth
it
over
there
there
he
said
be
a
nice
sensible
cousin
now
and
do
talk
about
going
i
am
going
she
said
and
slipping
past
him
went
down
the
stairs
by
herself
he
followed
after
then
the
porter
came
out
and
we
went
down
together
the
last
box
was
smaller
than
the
others
i
asked
him
to
carry
it
up
himself
pretending
i
had
hurt
my
hand
i
helped
him
to
get
it
on
his
back
and
went
off
home
now
i
could
go
away
the
following
day
that
afternoon
grindhusen
too
was
dismissed
the
engineer
had
sent
for
him
given
him
a
severe
talking
to
for
doing
no
work
and
staying
in
town
and
getting
drunk
in
a
word
his
services
were
no
longer
needed
i
thought
to
myself
it
was
strangely
sudden
this
new
burst
of
courage
on
the
part
of
the
engineer
he
was
so
young
he
had
needed
some
one
to
back
him
up
and
agree
to
everything
he
said
now
however
seeing
that
a
certain
troublesome
cousin
was
going
away
he
had
no
further
need
of
comfort
there
or
was
my
withered
soul
doing
him
an
injustice
grindhusen
was
greatly
distressed
he
had
reckoned
on
staying
in
town
all
the
summer
as
general
handyman
to
the
inspector
himself
but
all
hope
of
that
was
gone
now
the
inspector
was
no
longer
as
good
as
a
father
to
him
and
grindhusen
bore
the
disappointment
badly
when
they
came
to
settle
up
the
inspector
had
been
going
to
deduct
the
pieces
he
had
given
him
saying
they
had
only
been
meant
as
payment
in
advance
grindhusen
sat
in
the
general
room
at
the
and
told
us
all
about
it
adding
that
the
inspector
was
pretty
mean
in
the
matter
of
wages
after
all
at
this
one
of
the
men
burst
out
laughing
and
said
no
did
he
though
he
did
take
them
back
really
nay
said
grindhusen
he
did
dare
take
off
more
than
the
there
was
more
laughter
at
this
and
some
one
else
asked
no
really
which
one
was
it
did
he
knock
off
the
first
or
the
second
ha
ha
ha
that
the
best
i
heard
for
a
long
but
grindhusen
did
not
laugh
he
grew
more
and
more
sullen
and
despairing
what
was
he
to
do
now
farm
labourers
for
the
season
work
would
have
been
taken
on
everywhere
by
now
and
here
he
was
he
asked
me
where
i
was
going
and
when
i
told
him
he
begged
me
to
put
in
a
word
for
him
with
the
captain
and
see
if
i
could
get
him
taken
on
there
for
the
summer
meantime
he
would
stay
on
in
the
town
and
wait
till
he
heard
from
me
but
i
knew
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
grindhusen
money
if
he
stayed
on
in
the
town
the
end
of
it
was
i
took
him
along
with
me
as
the
best
thing
to
be
done
he
had
been
a
smart
hand
at
once
had
grindhusen
i
remembered
how
he
had
done
up
old
gunhild
cottage
on
the
island
he
could
come
and
help
me
now
for
the
time
being
later
on
we
would
surely
find
something
else
for
him
to
do
there
would
be
plenty
of
in
the
course
of
the
summer
where
he
might
be
useful
the
july
found
me
back
at
øvrebø
i
remember
dates
more
and
more
distinctly
now
partly
by
reason
of
my
getting
old
and
acquiring
the
intensified
interest
of
senility
in
such
things
partly
because
of
being
a
labourer
and
obliged
to
keep
account
of
my
working
days
but
an
old
man
may
keep
his
dates
in
mind
and
forget
all
about
far
more
important
things
up
to
now
for
instance
i
have
forgotten
to
mention
that
the
letter
i
had
from
captain
falkenberg
was
addressed
to
me
care
of
engineer
lassen
well
and
good
but
the
point
appeared
significant
the
captain
then
had
ascertained
whom
i
was
working
for
and
it
came
into
my
mind
that
possibly
the
captain
was
also
aware
of
who
else
had
been
in
the
care
of
engineer
lassen
that
summer
the
captain
was
still
away
on
duty
when
i
arrived
he
would
be
back
in
a
week
as
it
was
grindhusen
was
very
well
received
nils
was
quite
pleased
to
find
i
had
brought
my
mate
along
and
refused
to
let
me
keep
him
to
help
with
the
painting
but
sent
him
off
on
his
own
responsibility
to
work
in
the
turnip
and
potato
fields
there
was
no
end
of
work
weeding
and
thinning
out
and
nils
was
already
in
the
thick
of
the
he
was
the
same
splendid
earnest
farmer
as
ever
at
the
first
rest
while
the
horses
were
feeding
he
took
me
out
over
the
ground
to
look
at
the
crops
everything
was
doing
well
but
it
had
been
a
late
spring
that
year
and
the
was
barely
forming
as
yet
while
the
clover
had
just
begun
to
show
bloom
the
last
rain
had
beaten
down
a
lot
of
the
grass
and
it
could
not
pick
up
again
so
nils
had
put
on
the
we
walked
back
home
through
waving
grass
and
corn
there
was
a
whispering
in
the
winter
rye
and
the
stout
barley
nils
who
had
not
forgotten
his
schooling
called
to
mind
that
beautiful
line
of
bjørnson
like
a
whisper
in
the
corn
one
summer
time
to
get
the
horses
out
again
said
nils
stepping
out
a
little
and
waving
his
hand
once
more
out
over
the
fields
he
said
what
a
harvest
we
have
this
year
if
we
can
only
get
it
safely
in
so
grindhusen
went
off
to
work
in
the
fields
and
i
fell
to
on
the
painting
i
started
with
the
barn
and
all
that
was
to
be
red
then
i
did
over
the
flagstaff
and
the
down
among
the
lilacs
with
the
first
coat
of
oil
the
house
itself
i
meant
to
leave
till
the
last
it
was
built
in
good
country
style
with
rich
heavy
woodwork
and
a
carved
border
la
above
the
doorway
it
was
yellow
as
it
was
and
a
new
lot
of
yellow
paint
had
come
in
to
do
with
this
time
i
took
upon
myself
however
to
send
the
yellow
back
and
get
another
colour
in
exchange
in
my
judgment
the
house
ought
to
be
with
doors
and
and
white
but
that
would
be
for
the
captain
to
decide
but
though
every
one
on
the
place
was
as
nice
as
could
be
and
the
cook
in
authority
lenient
and
ragnhild
as
as
ever
we
all
felt
it
dull
with
the
master
and
mistress
away
all
save
grindhusen
honest
fellow
who
was
quite
content
decent
work
and
good
food
soon
set
him
up
again
and
in
a
few
days
he
was
happy
and
waxing
fat
his
one
anxiety
was
lest
the
captain
should
turn
him
off
when
he
came
home
but
no
such
thing
grindhusen
was
allowed
to
stay
ix
the
captain
arrived
i
was
giving
the
barn
its
second
coat
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
i
came
down
from
the
ladder
he
bade
me
welcome
running
away
from
your
money
like
that
he
said
and
i
fancied
he
looked
at
me
with
some
suspicion
as
he
asked
what
did
you
do
that
for
i
answered
simply
that
i
had
no
idea
of
presuming
to
make
him
a
present
of
my
work
the
money
could
stand
over
that
was
all
he
brightened
up
at
that
yes
yes
of
course
well
i
very
glad
you
came
we
must
have
the
flagstaff
white
i
suppose
i
did
not
dare
tell
him
at
once
all
i
wanted
done
in
white
but
simply
said
yes
i
got
hold
of
some
white
have
you
though
that
good
you
brought
another
man
up
with
you
i
hear
yes
i
do
know
what
captain
thinks
he
can
stay
nils
has
got
him
to
work
out
in
the
fields
already
and
anyhow
you
all
seem
to
do
as
you
like
with
me
he
added
jestingly
and
you
been
working
with
the
lumbermen
have
you
hardly
the
sort
of
thing
for
you
was
it
then
as
if
anxious
not
to
seem
curious
about
my
work
with
engineer
lassen
he
broke
off
abruptly
and
said
when
are
you
going
to
start
painting
the
house
i
thought
of
beginning
this
afternoon
it
need
scraping
a
bit
here
and
good
and
if
you
find
the
woodwork
loose
anywhere
you
can
put
in
a
nail
or
so
at
the
same
time
have
you
had
a
look
at
the
fields
everything
looking
very
nice
you
men
did
good
work
last
spring
do
no
harm
now
if
we
had
a
little
rain
for
the
upper
grindhusen
and
i
passed
lots
of
places
on
the
way
up
that
needed
rain
more
than
here
it
clay
bottom
here
and
far
up
in
the
that
true
how
did
you
know
that
by
the
way
i
looked
about
when
i
was
here
in
the
spring
i
answered
and
i
did
a
little
digging
here
and
there
i
an
idea
you
be
wanting
to
have
water
laid
on
to
the
house
some
time
or
other
so
i
went
prospecting
a
water
laid
on
well
yes
i
did
think
of
it
at
one
time
but
yes
i
was
going
to
have
it
done
some
years
back
but
i
could
get
everything
done
at
once
and
then
it
was
held
up
and
just
now
i
shall
want
the
money
for
other
a
wrinkle
showed
between
his
eyes
for
a
moment
he
stood
looking
down
in
thought
well
well
that
thousand
dozen
battens
ought
to
do
it
and
leave
something
over
he
said
suddenly
water
it
would
have
to
be
laid
on
to
the
outbuildings
as
well
a
whole
system
of
there
be
no
though
no
eh
oh
well
we
see
what
was
i
going
to
say
did
you
have
a
good
time
down
there
in
the
town
not
a
big
place
but
you
do
see
more
people
there
and
the
railway
brings
visitors
now
and
again
no
aha
i
thought
to
myself
he
knows
well
enough
what
visitor
came
to
stay
with
engineer
lassen
this
summer
i
answered
that
i
did
not
care
much
for
the
place
which
was
perfectly
true
no
really
he
seemed
to
find
something
to
ponder
over
in
that
he
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
whistling
softly
to
himself
then
he
walked
away
the
captain
was
in
good
spirits
he
had
been
more
communicative
than
ever
before
he
nodded
to
me
as
he
went
off
just
as
of
old
he
was
now
quick
and
determined
taking
an
interest
in
his
affairs
once
more
and
sober
as
water
i
felt
cheered
myself
to
see
him
so
he
was
no
wastrel
he
had
had
a
spell
of
foolishness
and
dissipation
but
it
needed
only
his
own
resolution
to
put
an
end
to
that
an
oar
in
the
water
looks
broken
to
the
eye
but
it
is
whole
it
set
in
to
rain
and
i
had
to
stop
work
on
the
painting
nils
had
been
lucky
enough
to
get
in
all
the
hay
that
was
cut
we
got
to
work
now
on
the
potatoes
all
hands
out
in
the
fields
at
once
with
the
women
folk
from
the
house
as
well
meanwhile
the
captain
stayed
indoors
all
alone
it
was
dull
enough
now
and
again
he
would
touch
the
keys
of
fruen
piano
he
came
out
once
or
twice
to
where
we
were
at
work
and
he
carried
no
umbrella
but
let
himself
get
drenched
to
the
skin
grand
weather
for
the
crops
he
would
say
or
again
looks
like
being
an
extra
special
harvest
this
year
but
when
he
went
back
to
the
house
there
was
only
himself
and
loneliness
to
meet
him
we
better
off
ourselves
than
he
is
now
said
nils
so
we
worked
away
at
the
potatoes
and
when
they
were
done
there
were
the
turnips
and
by
the
time
we
were
through
with
them
the
weather
began
to
clear
ideal
weather
all
that
one
could
wish
for
nils
and
i
were
as
proud
of
it
all
as
if
we
owned
the
place
and
now
the
haymaking
began
in
earnest
the
maids
were
out
spreading
in
the
wake
of
the
machine
and
grindhusen
was
set
to
work
with
a
scythe
in
the
corners
and
awkward
parts
where
the
machine
could
not
go
and
i
got
out
my
paint
and
set
about
the
house
the
captain
came
up
what
colour
that
you
got
here
he
asked
what
could
i
say
to
that
i
was
nervous
i
know
but
my
greatest
fear
was
lest
i
should
not
be
allowed
to
paint
it
grey
after
all
as
it
was
i
said
oh
it
only
some
i
do
know
it
does
matter
what
we
put
on
for
the
first
coat
that
saved
me
for
the
time
being
at
any
rate
the
captain
said
no
more
about
it
then
when
i
had
done
the
house
all
grey
and
doors
and
windows
white
i
went
down
to
the
and
did
that
the
same
but
it
turned
out
horrible
to
look
at
the
yellow
underneath
showed
through
and
made
it
a
ghastly
colour
the
flagstaff
i
took
down
and
painted
a
clean
white
then
i
put
in
a
spell
of
with
nils
and
was
haymaking
for
some
days
early
in
august
it
was
now
when
i
went
back
to
my
painting
again
i
had
settled
in
my
mind
to
start
on
the
house
as
early
as
possible
so
as
to
be
well
on
the
way
with
it
before
the
captain
was
up
too
far
if
i
could
manage
it
to
go
back
i
started
at
three
in
the
morning
there
was
a
heavy
dew
and
i
had
to
rub
the
woodwork
over
with
a
bit
of
sack
i
worked
away
for
an
hour
and
then
had
coffee
then
on
again
till
eight
i
knew
the
captain
would
be
getting
up
then
so
i
went
off
to
help
nils
for
an
hour
and
be
out
of
the
way
i
had
done
as
much
as
i
wanted
and
my
idea
now
was
to
give
the
captain
time
to
get
over
the
shock
of
my
grey
in
case
he
should
have
got
up
in
an
irritable
mood
after
breakfast
i
went
back
to
work
and
stood
there
on
my
ladder
painting
away
as
innocently
as
could
be
when
the
captain
came
up
are
you
doing
it
over
with
grey
again
he
called
up
yes
i
do
know
if
now
what
the
meaning
of
all
this
come
down
off
that
ladder
at
once
i
clambered
down
but
i
was
not
anxious
now
i
had
thought
out
something
to
say
that
i
fancied
would
prove
effective
at
the
right
moment
unless
my
judgment
was
altogether
at
fault
i
tried
first
of
all
to
make
out
it
did
matter
really
what
colour
we
used
for
the
second
time
either
but
the
captain
cut
me
short
here
and
said
nonsense
yellow
on
top
of
that
grey
will
look
like
mud
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
well
then
we
might
give
it
two
coats
of
yellow
i
suggested
four
coats
of
paint
no
thank
you
and
all
that
white
you
been
wasting
it
ever
so
much
dearer
than
the
this
was
perfectly
true
and
the
very
argument
i
had
been
fearing
all
along
i
answered
now
let
me
paint
it
what
it
would
look
better
there
something
about
the
house
and
with
the
green
of
the
woods
behind
the
style
of
the
place
is
is
grey
you
mean
he
swung
off
impatiently
a
few
steps
and
came
back
again
and
then
i
faced
him
more
innocently
than
ever
with
an
inspiration
surely
sent
from
above
now
i
remember
yes
i
always
seen
it
grey
in
my
mind
ever
since
one
day
it
was
fruen
that
said
so
i
was
watching
him
closely
he
gave
a
great
start
and
stared
at
me
for
a
moment
then
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
began
fidgeting
with
it
at
one
eye
as
if
to
get
out
a
speck
or
something
indeed
he
said
did
she
say
so
yes
i
almost
sure
it
was
that
it
a
long
time
back
now
but
oh
nonsense
he
broke
out
abruptly
and
strode
away
i
heard
him
clearing
his
throat
hard
as
he
crossed
the
courtyard
behind
i
stood
there
limply
for
a
while
feeling
anything
but
comfortable
myself
i
dared
not
go
on
with
the
painting
now
and
risk
making
him
angry
again
i
went
round
to
the
back
and
put
in
an
hour
cutting
firewood
when
i
came
round
again
the
captain
looked
out
from
an
open
window
upstairs
and
called
down
you
may
as
well
go
on
with
it
now
you
got
so
far
i
do
know
what
possessed
you
i
sure
but
get
on
with
it
the
window
had
been
open
before
but
he
slammed
it
to
and
i
went
on
with
the
work
a
week
passed
i
spent
my
time
between
painting
and
haymaking
grindhusen
was
good
enough
at
hoeing
potatoes
and
using
a
rake
here
and
there
but
not
of
much
account
when
it
came
to
loading
hay
nils
himself
was
a
hand
and
a
glutton
for
work
i
gave
the
house
a
third
coat
and
the
delicate
grey
picked
out
with
white
made
the
place
look
nobler
altogether
one
afternoon
i
was
at
work
the
captain
came
walking
up
from
the
road
he
watched
me
for
a
bit
then
took
out
his
handkerchief
as
if
the
heat
troubled
him
and
said
yes
better
go
on
with
it
now
you
got
so
far
i
must
say
she
far
wrong
about
the
colour
all
nonsense
though
really
h
i
made
no
answer
the
captain
used
his
handkerchief
again
and
said
hot
again
today
puh
what
was
i
going
to
say
yes
it
does
look
so
bad
after
all
no
she
was
right
that
is
i
mean
you
were
right
about
the
colour
i
was
looking
at
it
from
down
there
just
now
and
it
makes
quite
a
handsome
place
and
anyhow
it
too
late
to
alter
it
i
thought
so
too
i
said
it
suits
the
yes
yes
it
suits
the
house
as
it
were
and
what
was
it
she
said
about
the
woods
behind
my
wife
i
mean
the
background
or
something
it
a
long
time
ago
now
but
i
almost
sure
yes
yes
never
mind
i
must
say
i
never
thought
it
would
turn
out
like
that
turn
out
so
well
will
you
have
enough
white
though
to
finish
well
yes
i
sent
back
the
yellow
and
got
some
white
the
captain
smiled
shook
his
head
and
walked
away
so
i
had
been
right
after
all
haymaking
took
up
all
my
time
now
till
it
was
done
but
nils
lent
me
a
hand
in
return
painting
at
the
in
the
evening
even
grindhusen
joined
in
and
took
a
brush
he
was
much
of
a
painter
he
said
but
he
reckoned
he
could
be
trusted
to
paint
a
bit
of
a
wall
grindhusen
was
picking
up
fast
at
last
the
buildings
were
finished
hardly
recognizable
they
were
in
their
new
finery
and
when
we
cleaned
up
a
bit
in
the
shrubbery
and
the
little
park
this
was
our
own
idea
the
whole
place
looked
different
altogether
and
the
captain
thanked
us
specially
for
what
we
done
we
started
on
the
rye
then
and
at
the
same
time
the
autumn
rain
set
in
but
we
worked
away
all
we
knew
and
there
came
a
spell
of
sunshine
in
between
whiles
there
were
big
fields
of
thick
heavy
rye
and
big
fields
again
of
oats
and
barley
not
yet
ripe
it
was
a
rich
landscape
to
work
in
the
clover
was
seeding
but
the
turnips
were
somewhat
behindhand
a
good
soaking
would
put
them
right
said
nils
the
captain
sent
me
up
to
the
post
from
time
to
time
once
he
gave
me
a
letter
for
his
wife
a
whole
bundle
of
letters
there
were
to
different
people
and
hers
in
the
middle
it
was
addressed
care
of
her
mother
in
kristianssand
when
i
came
back
in
the
evening
and
took
in
the
incoming
post
the
captain
first
words
were
you
posted
the
letters
all
right
yes
i
said
time
went
on
on
wet
days
when
there
was
little
we
could
do
out
of
doors
the
captain
wanted
me
to
paint
a
bit
here
and
there
about
the
house
inside
he
showed
me
some
fine
enamels
he
had
got
in
and
said
now
here
the
staircase
to
begin
with
i
want
that
white
and
ordered
a
dark
red
to
put
down
then
there
be
doors
and
windows
but
i
want
all
this
done
as
soon
as
possible
really
it
been
left
too
long
as
it
i
quite
agreed
that
this
was
a
good
idea
of
the
captain
he
had
lived
carelessly
enough
for
years
past
now
never
troubling
about
the
look
of
his
house
now
he
had
begun
to
take
an
interest
in
it
again
it
was
a
sort
of
reawakening
he
took
me
over
the
place
upstairs
and
down
and
showed
me
what
was
to
be
done
i
noticed
the
pictures
and
sculpture
in
the
rooms
there
was
a
big
marble
lion
and
paintings
by
askevold
and
the
famous
dahl
heirlooms
i
supposed
they
would
be
fruen
room
upstairs
looked
just
as
if
she
were
at
home
with
all
sorts
of
little
trifles
neatly
in
their
places
and
clothes
hanging
still
on
the
pegs
it
was
a
fine
old
house
with
moulded
ceilings
and
some
of
the
walls
done
in
costly
style
but
the
everywhere
was
faded
or
flaking
off
the
staircase
was
broad
and
easy
with
seats
and
a
mahogany
handrail
i
was
painting
indoors
one
day
when
the
captain
came
in
it
i
know
but
this
indoor
work
important
too
my
wife
will
be
back
soon
i
do
know
what
we
to
do
really
i
like
to
have
the
place
thoroughly
cleaned
so
that
letter
was
asking
her
to
come
back
i
thought
to
myself
but
then
again
it
was
some
days
since
he
had
written
and
i
had
been
to
the
post
several
times
myself
after
but
no
answer
had
come
i
knew
fruen
writing
i
had
seen
it
six
years
before
but
the
captain
thought
perhaps
that
he
had
only
to
say
come
and
she
would
obey
well
well
he
might
be
right
she
was
taking
a
little
time
to
get
ready
that
was
all
how
was
i
to
know
the
painting
had
grown
so
important
now
that
the
captain
went
up
himself
to
the
clearing
and
got
lars
to
come
down
and
help
with
the
in
my
place
nils
was
by
no
means
pleased
with
the
exchange
for
lars
was
not
over
willing
under
orders
on
the
place
where
he
had
been
in
charge
himself
in
days
gone
by
but
there
was
no
such
need
of
hurry
about
the
painting
as
it
turned
out
the
captain
sent
the
lad
up
twice
to
the
post
but
i
watched
for
him
on
the
way
back
both
times
and
found
he
had
no
letter
from
fruen
perhaps
she
was
not
coming
after
all
ay
it
might
be
as
bad
as
that
or
she
felt
herself
in
a
false
position
and
was
too
proud
to
say
yes
because
her
husband
called
it
might
be
that
but
the
paint
was
on
and
had
time
to
dry
the
red
came
and
was
laid
down
with
brass
rods
the
staircase
looked
wonderfully
fine
wonderfully
fine
too
were
the
doors
and
windows
in
the
rooms
upstairs
but
fruen
did
not
come
no
we
got
through
with
the
rye
and
set
to
work
in
good
time
on
the
barley
but
fruen
did
not
come
the
captain
went
out
and
gazed
down
the
road
whistling
to
himself
he
was
looking
thinner
now
often
and
often
he
would
come
out
to
where
we
were
at
work
and
keep
with
us
looking
on
all
the
time
without
a
word
but
if
nils
happened
to
ask
him
anything
he
did
not
start
as
if
his
thoughts
had
been
elsewhere
but
was
quick
and
ready
as
could
be
he
did
not
seem
dejected
and
as
for
looking
thin
that
was
perhaps
because
he
had
got
nils
to
cut
his
hair
then
i
was
sent
up
to
the
post
again
and
this
time
there
was
a
letter
fruen
hand
and
postmarked
kristianssand
i
hurried
back
laid
the
letter
in
among
the
rest
of
the
post
and
handed
the
whole
bundle
to
the
captain
outside
the
house
he
took
it
with
a
careless
word
of
thanks
showing
no
eagerness
to
see
what
there
was
he
was
used
to
being
disappointed
corn
coming
in
everywhere
i
suppose
he
asked
casually
glancing
at
the
letters
one
after
another
what
was
the
road
like
all
right
while
i
was
telling
him
he
came
upon
fruen
letter
and
at
once
packing
up
the
whole
bundle
together
he
turned
to
me
with
a
sudden
intensified
interest
in
other
people
crops
and
the
state
of
the
roads
keeping
himself
well
in
hand
he
was
not
going
to
show
feeling
openly
he
nodded
as
he
walked
off
and
said
thank
you
once
more
next
day
the
captain
came
out
and
washed
and
greased
the
carriage
himself
but
it
was
two
days
more
before
he
used
it
we
were
sitting
at
supper
one
evening
when
the
captain
came
into
the
kitchen
and
said
he
wanted
some
one
to
drive
him
to
the
station
tomorrow
he
could
have
driven
himself
but
he
was
going
to
fetch
his
wife
who
was
coming
home
from
abroad
and
he
would
have
to
take
the
landau
in
case
it
rained
nils
decided
then
that
grindhusen
had
better
drive
he
being
the
one
who
could
best
be
spared
the
rest
of
us
went
on
with
our
while
they
were
away
there
was
plenty
to
do
besides
the
rye
and
barley
not
yet
in
there
were
still
potatoes
to
hoe
and
turnips
to
see
to
but
ragnhild
and
the
dairymaid
both
lent
a
hand
all
youth
and
energy
they
were
it
might
have
been
pleasant
enough
to
work
side
by
side
with
my
old
mate
lars
falkenberg
once
more
but
he
and
nils
could
not
get
on
together
and
instead
of
cheerful
comradeship
a
gloomy
silence
hung
over
the
fields
lars
seemed
to
have
got
over
his
late
towards
me
in
some
degree
but
he
was
short
and
sullen
with
us
all
on
account
of
nils
at
last
nils
decided
that
lars
should
take
the
pair
of
chestnuts
and
get
to
work
on
the
autumn
ploughing
lars
was
offended
and
said
crossly
no
he
never
heard
of
doing
things
that
way
before
he
said
starting
to
plough
your
land
before
you
got
the
harvest
off
it
that
may
be
said
nils
but
i
find
you
land
that
has
been
reaped
enough
to
keep
you
there
were
more
words
over
that
lars
found
everything
all
wrong
somehow
at
øvrebø
in
the
old
days
he
used
to
do
his
work
and
sing
songs
after
for
the
company
at
the
house
now
it
was
all
a
mess
and
a
muddle
and
no
sense
in
any
way
of
doing
things
ploughing
indeed
not
if
he
knew
it
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
said
nils
nowadays
see
folk
ploughing
between
the
and
the
i
not
seen
it
yet
said
lars
but
it
seems
you
seen
a
lot
of
all
the
silly
goats
but
the
end
of
it
was
that
lars
gave
way
nils
being
head
man
there
and
went
on
ploughing
till
the
captain
came
home
it
crossed
my
mind
that
i
had
left
some
washing
behind
with
emma
when
i
went
away
before
but
i
judged
it
best
not
to
go
up
to
the
clearing
after
it
now
while
lars
was
in
his
present
mood
x
the
captain
and
his
wife
came
next
day
nils
and
i
had
talked
over
whether
to
hoist
the
flag
i
dared
not
myself
but
nils
was
less
cautious
and
said
we
must
so
there
it
was
flapping
broad
and
free
from
its
white
staff
i
was
close
at
hand
when
the
carriage
drove
up
and
they
got
out
fruen
walked
out
far
across
the
courtyard
looked
at
the
house
and
clapped
her
hands
i
heard
her
too
loud
in
wonder
as
she
entered
the
hall
at
sight
of
the
stairs
no
doubt
and
the
new
red
carpet
grindhusen
had
no
sooner
got
the
horses
in
than
he
came
up
to
me
all
agape
with
astonishment
over
something
and
drew
me
aside
to
talk
there
must
be
something
wrong
he
said
that
not
fru
falkenberg
surely
is
she
married
to
him
the
captain
i
mean
why
yes
grindhusen
the
captain
wife
is
married
to
the
captain
what
makes
you
ask
but
it
that
cousin
girl
i
stake
my
life
on
it
if
it
not
the
very
same
one
the
inspector
cousin
that
was
not
a
bit
of
it
grindhusen
but
it
might
be
her
but
i
stake
my
life
on
it
i
saw
her
with
him
myself
i
do
know
how
many
well
well
she
may
be
his
cousin
as
far
as
that
goes
but
what
it
to
do
with
us
i
saw
it
the
moment
she
got
out
of
the
train
and
she
looked
at
me
too
and
gave
a
start
i
could
see
her
breathing
quickly
after
come
telling
me
but
i
ca
make
out
is
she
from
here
was
fruen
pleased
or
did
she
look
unhappy
i
asked
nay
i
do
know
yes
i
think
she
grindhusen
shook
his
head
still
marvelling
how
this
could
be
the
captain
wife
you
must
have
seen
her
with
the
inspector
yourself
he
said
did
you
recognize
her
again
was
she
pleased
did
you
say
pleased
why
yes
i
suppose
so
i
do
know
they
talked
such
a
lot
of
queer
stuff
the
pair
of
them
driving
home
began
at
the
station
the
minute
she
got
out
there
was
a
whole
lot
i
could
make
out
at
all
do
know
what
to
say
said
she
i
beg
you
so
earnestly
to
forgive
me
for
it
all
so
do
i
says
he
now
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
thing
and
they
were
both
of
them
crying
i
believe
in
the
carriage
after
had
the
place
painted
and
done
up
a
bit
said
the
captain
you
says
she
and
then
he
went
on
talking
about
all
her
things
and
how
they
were
still
there
and
never
been
touched
i
know
what
things
he
meant
but
he
thought
she
find
everything
still
in
its
place
he
said
did
you
ever
hear
the
like
your
things
he
said
and
then
he
went
on
about
somebody
elisabet
and
said
he
never
gave
her
a
thought
and
never
had
i
think
he
said
and
she
cried
like
anything
at
that
and
was
all
upset
but
she
did
say
a
word
about
being
abroad
as
the
captain
said
no
i
stake
my
life
she
come
from
the
i
began
to
fear
i
had
made
a
grave
mistake
in
bringing
grindhusen
to
øvrebø
it
was
done
now
but
i
wished
it
undone
and
i
told
grindhusen
himself
as
much
and
that
pretty
plainly
fruen
here
the
mistress
of
the
place
and
good
and
kind
as
could
be
to
every
one
and
the
captain
as
well
remember
that
but
you
find
yourself
whipped
out
of
here
and
at
once
if
you
go
gossiping
and
telling
tales
take
my
advice
and
be
careful
you
got
a
good
job
here
with
good
pay
and
decent
food
think
of
that
and
keep
quiet
while
you
yes
yes
you
right
said
grindhusen
meekly
enough
i
do
say
a
word
only
that
she
the
very
image
of
that
cousin
down
there
and
did
i
ever
say
more
than
that
i
do
know
what
you
got
to
make
such
a
fuss
about
and
as
for
that
maybe
she
a
bit
fairer
than
the
cousin
i
wo
swear
it
the
same
sort
of
hair
and
i
never
said
it
was
but
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
thought
i
tell
you
straight
out
i
was
thinking
she
was
too
good
to
be
that
cousin
girl
that
was
my
very
thought
be
a
shame
for
her
to
be
cousin
to
a
fellow
like
that
and
i
ca
think
how
anybody
ever
could
i
not
thinking
about
the
money
now
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
i
not
the
man
to
make
a
fuss
over
losing
a
piece
no
more
than
you
yourself
but
it
was
a
mean
thing
to
do
all
the
same
giving
me
the
money
one
day
and
taking
it
back
the
next
ay
that
it
was
i
say
no
more
than
that
but
i
know
what
the
matter
with
you
lately
flying
out
the
least
word
a
man
says
and
what
have
i
said
anyway
a
mean
lot
that
he
was
paid
me
two
kroner
a
day
and
find
my
own
food
and
always
niggling
and
haggling
over
every
little
thing
i
had
enough
of
your
talk
anyhow
but
i
tell
you
what
was
my
very
thought
if
you
want
to
know
but
all
his
flow
of
talk
did
not
avail
to
hide
the
fact
that
he
had
recognized
fruen
at
once
and
was
still
convinced
that
he
was
right
all
things
in
order
now
the
captain
and
fruen
at
home
bright
days
and
a
rich
harvest
what
more
could
any
wish
for
fruen
greets
me
with
a
kindly
glance
and
says
the
place
looks
different
altogether
after
the
way
you
painted
it
so
nicely
the
captain
ever
so
she
seemed
calmer
now
than
when
i
had
seen
her
last
on
the
stairs
of
the
hotel
in
the
town
she
did
not
start
and
breathe
quickly
at
sight
of
me
as
she
had
with
grindhusen
and
that
could
only
mean
she
was
not
displeased
at
seeing
me
again
so
i
thought
to
myself
and
was
glad
to
think
so
but
why
had
she
not
left
off
that
unsteady
glance
that
flutter
of
the
eyes
she
had
fallen
into
of
late
if
i
were
the
captain
now
i
would
speak
to
her
about
it
and
her
complexion
too
was
not
what
it
had
been
there
were
some
curious
little
spots
about
the
temples
but
what
matter
she
was
no
less
pretty
for
that
i
afraid
though
she
went
on
it
was
my
idea
at
all
with
the
lovely
grey
for
the
house
you
must
have
made
a
mistake
in
thinking
i
said
well
then
i
ca
make
it
out
but
anyhow
it
no
matter
the
captain
himself
decided
to
have
the
staircase
is
simply
splendid
and
so
are
the
rooms
upstairs
twice
as
bright
as
before
fruen
herself
was
trying
to
be
twice
as
bright
and
why
yes
grindhusen
the
captain
wife
is
married
twice
as
good
as
i
knew
that
well
enough
and
she
fancied
she
owed
me
these
little
marks
of
kindliness
for
something
or
other
well
and
good
but
now
it
was
enough
best
let
it
be
autumn
drawing
on
the
scent
of
the
jasmine
all
importunate
down
in
the
shrubbery
and
red
and
yellow
showing
up
long
since
on
the
wooded
hills
not
a
soul
in
the
place
but
is
glad
to
have
fruen
at
home
again
the
flag
too
does
its
part
is
like
a
sunday
the
maids
have
put
clean
aprons
on
fresh
from
the
ironing
in
the
evening
i
went
down
by
the
little
stone
steps
to
the
shrubbery
and
sat
there
a
while
the
jasmines
were
pouring
out
waves
of
perfume
after
the
heat
of
the
day
after
awhile
nils
came
down
looking
for
me
no
visitors
here
now
says
nils
and
no
high
at
nights
have
you
heard
anything
of
that
sort
at
night
now
since
the
captain
first
came
back
and
that
full
ten
weeks
ago
now
what
say
if
i
tore
off
this
thing
now
and
he
pointed
to
his
temperance
badge
captain
given
up
drinking
here
fruen
home
again
and
no
call
to
be
unfriendly
anyway
to
either
of
he
handed
me
a
knife
and
i
cut
the
badge
away
we
talked
for
a
bit
about
the
nils
thought
of
nothing
else
we
have
most
of
the
corn
under
shelter
by
tomorrow
night
he
says
and
thank
goodness
for
that
then
we
sow
the
winter
rye
queer
thing
is
it
here
lars
went
on
year
after
year
sowing
by
machine
and
thought
it
good
enough
not
if
i
know
it
we
sow
ours
by
but
why
on
land
like
ours
now
just
take
the
man
over
there
for
instance
he
sowed
by
machine
three
weeks
ago
and
some
come
up
and
some
not
no
the
machine
goes
too
deep
in
the
h
do
the
jasmines
smell
fine
tonight
yes
there
been
a
big
difference
with
the
barley
and
oats
these
last
few
days
getting
on
time
for
bed
though
now
he
got
up
but
i
did
not
move
looks
like
being
fine
again
tomorrow
says
nils
glancing
at
the
sky
and
then
he
went
on
about
the
grass
in
the
garden
worth
cutting
he
said
it
was
you
going
to
stay
down
here
long
he
asked
suddenly
yes
for
a
bit
why
not
oh
well
perhaps
i
better
go
up
nils
walked
off
a
few
paces
then
came
back
again
better
not
stay
here
any
longer
he
said
come
along
up
here
with
think
so
i
said
and
rose
at
once
evidently
nils
had
something
in
his
mind
and
had
come
down
here
on
purpose
to
fetch
me
had
he
found
me
out
but
what
was
there
to
find
out
did
i
know
myself
what
i
had
gone
down
to
the
shrubbery
for
i
remember
now
that
i
lay
face
downwards
chewing
a
stalk
of
grass
there
was
light
in
a
certain
upstairs
window
of
the
house
i
was
looking
at
that
and
that
was
all
not
being
inquisitive
now
but
what
the
matter
i
asked
nothing
said
nils
the
girls
said
you
were
down
here
so
i
just
came
along
why
what
else
so
the
maids
had
found
me
out
i
thought
to
myself
and
was
ill
pleased
at
the
thought
ragnhild
it
must
be
a
devil
of
a
girl
sharp
as
a
needle
she
must
have
said
a
lot
more
than
nils
was
willing
to
confess
and
what
if
fruen
herself
had
seen
me
from
the
window
i
resolved
now
to
be
cold
and
indifferent
as
ice
henceforward
all
the
days
of
my
life
ragnhild
is
properly
in
clover
the
thick
stair
carpet
muffles
every
step
she
can
run
upstairs
whenever
she
pleases
and
slip
down
again
in
a
moment
without
a
sound
i
ca
make
it
out
about
fruen
says
ragnhild
here
she
come
back
and
ought
to
be
happy
and
good
tempered
as
could
be
and
instead
she
all
tears
and
frowning
i
heard
the
captain
telling
her
today
do
be
a
little
reasonable
lovise
he
said
sorry
i
wo
do
it
any
more
says
fruen
and
then
she
cried
because
she
been
unreasonable
but
that
about
never
doing
it
any
more
she
said
that
now
every
day
since
she
came
back
but
she
done
it
again
all
the
same
poor
dear
she
a
toothache
today
she
was
simply
crying
out
with
the
pain
go
and
get
on
with
the
potatoes
ragnhild
said
nils
quickly
no
time
for
gossiping
we
all
of
us
our
now
there
was
much
to
be
done
nils
was
afraid
the
corn
would
spoil
if
he
left
it
too
long
at
the
poles
better
to
get
it
in
as
it
was
well
and
good
but
that
meant
threshing
the
worst
of
it
at
once
and
spreading
the
grain
over
the
floor
of
every
shed
and
outhouse
even
in
our
own
big
there
was
a
large
layer
of
corn
drying
on
the
floor
any
more
irons
in
the
fire
ay
indeed
and
all
the
while
hot
and
waiting
bad
weather
has
set
in
and
all
the
work
ought
to
be
done
at
once
when
we
finished
threshing
there
the
fresh
straw
to
be
cut
up
and
salted
down
in
bins
to
keep
it
from
rotting
that
all
not
by
a
long
way
irons
enough
still
glowing
hot
grindhusen
and
the
maids
are
pulling
potatoes
nils
snatches
the
precious
time
after
a
couple
of
dry
days
to
sow
a
patch
of
rye
and
send
the
lad
over
it
with
the
harrow
lars
falkenberg
is
still
ploughing
he
has
given
way
altogether
and
turned
out
a
fine
ploughman
since
the
captain
and
fruen
came
back
when
the
too
soft
he
ploughs
the
meadows
then
when
sun
and
wind
have
dried
things
a
bit
he
goes
on
to
the
again
the
work
goes
on
steadily
and
well
in
the
afternoon
the
captain
himself
comes
out
to
lend
a
hand
the
last
load
of
corn
in
being
brought
in
captain
falkenberg
is
no
child
at
the
work
big
and
strong
he
is
and
with
the
right
knack
of
it
see
him
loading
up
oats
from
the
his
second
load
now
just
then
fruen
comes
along
down
the
road
and
crosses
over
to
where
we
are
at
work
her
eyes
are
bright
she
seems
pleased
to
watch
her
husband
loading
up
corn
arbejdet
footnote
a
blessing
on
the
she
says
thanks
says
the
captain
that
what
we
used
to
say
in
what
that
what
we
used
to
say
in
oh
the
captain
is
busy
with
his
work
and
in
the
rustle
of
the
straw
he
does
not
always
hear
what
she
says
but
has
to
look
up
and
ask
again
and
this
annoys
them
both
are
the
oats
ripe
she
asks
yes
thank
goodness
but
not
dry
i
suppose
eh
i
ca
hear
what
you
oh
i
did
say
a
long
uncomfortable
silence
after
that
the
captain
tries
once
or
twice
with
a
word
but
gets
no
answer
so
you
out
on
a
round
of
inspection
he
says
jestingly
have
you
seen
how
the
potatoes
are
getting
on
no
she
answers
but
i
go
over
there
by
all
means
if
you
bear
the
sight
of
me
it
was
too
dreadful
to
hear
them
going
on
like
this
i
must
have
frowned
unconsciously
shown
some
such
feeling
then
suddenly
remembering
that
for
certain
reasons
i
was
to
be
cold
as
ice
i
frowned
the
more
freun
looked
straight
at
me
and
said
what
are
you
scowling
at
scowling
eh
says
the
captain
joining
in
with
a
forced
laugh
fruen
takes
him
up
on
the
instant
ah
you
managed
to
hear
that
time
really
lovise
fruen
eyes
dimmed
suddenly
she
stood
a
moment
then
ran
stooping
forward
round
behind
the
frames
and
sobbed
the
captain
went
over
to
her
what
is
it
lovise
tell
me
oh
nothing
nothing
go
she
was
sick
we
could
hear
it
and
moaning
and
saying
heaven
help
me
my
wife
not
very
well
just
now
says
the
captain
to
me
we
make
out
what
it
there
sickness
in
the
neighbourhood
i
suggested
for
something
to
say
sort
of
autumn
fever
i
heard
about
it
up
at
the
post
is
there
though
why
there
you
are
lovise
he
calls
out
some
sort
of
fever
about
it
seems
that
all
it
fruen
made
no
answer
we
went
on
loading
up
and
fruen
moved
farther
and
farther
away
as
we
came
up
at
last
the
frames
were
cleared
and
she
stood
there
guiltily
very
pale
after
her
trouble
shall
i
see
you
back
to
the
house
asked
the
captain
no
thank
you
i
rather
not
she
answered
walking
away
the
captain
stayed
out
and
worked
with
us
till
evening
so
here
was
everything
gone
wrong
again
oh
but
it
was
hard
for
them
both
and
it
was
not
just
a
little
matter
that
could
be
got
over
by
a
little
give
and
take
on
either
side
as
folk
say
no
it
was
a
thing
insuperable
a
trouble
rooted
deep
and
now
it
had
come
to
mutiny
no
less
fruen
had
taken
to
locking
her
door
at
night
ragnhild
had
heard
the
captain
highly
offended
talking
to
her
through
the
wall
but
that
evening
the
captain
had
demanded
to
speak
with
her
in
her
room
before
she
went
to
bed
fruen
agreed
and
there
was
a
further
scene
each
was
willing
and
anxious
no
doubt
to
set
matters
right
but
it
was
hopeless
now
it
was
too
late
we
sat
in
the
kitchen
nils
and
i
listening
to
ragnhild
story
i
had
never
seen
nils
look
so
miserable
before
if
things
go
wrong
again
now
it
all
over
he
said
i
thought
to
myself
last
summer
that
perhaps
a
good
sound
thrashing
would
do
her
good
but
that
was
just
foolishness
i
can
see
now
did
she
talk
about
running
away
again
she
said
something
about
it
answered
ragnhild
and
then
she
went
on
something
like
this
it
began
with
the
captain
asking
if
she
think
it
was
this
local
sickness
she
had
got
fruen
answered
it
could
hardly
be
any
local
sickness
that
had
turned
her
against
him
so
you
against
me
oh
i
could
scream
sometimes
at
table
for
instance
the
way
you
eat
and
eat
i
says
the
captain
i
ca
see
there
anything
very
wrong
in
that
it
just
natural
there
no
rule
for
how
much
one
ought
to
eat
at
a
meal
to
have
to
sit
and
look
at
you
it
makes
me
sick
it
that
that
makes
me
anyhow
you
ca
say
i
drink
too
much
now
said
he
better
than
it
was
indeed
it
worse
then
says
the
captain
really
i
do
think
you
might
make
allowances
for
me
a
little
after
i
i
mean
considering
what
you
did
yourself
this
summer
you
right
says
fruen
beginning
to
cry
you
knew
how
it
hurts
and
plagues
me
night
and
day
thinking
of
that
but
i
never
said
a
word
i
know
says
she
crying
all
the
more
i
asked
you
myself
to
come
back
he
said
but
at
that
she
seemed
to
think
he
was
taking
too
much
credit
to
himself
she
stopped
crying
and
answered
with
a
toss
of
her
head
and
it
would
have
been
better
if
never
asked
me
back
if
it
was
only
to
go
on
like
this
what
says
he
your
own
way
in
everything
now
the
same
as
before
only
you
do
care
for
anything
at
all
you
never
touch
the
piano
even
only
go
about
cross
and
irritable
all
the
time
there
no
pleasing
you
with
anything
and
you
shut
your
door
at
night
and
lock
me
out
well
and
good
lock
me
out
if
you
like
you
that
are
hard
to
please
if
you
ask
me
she
said
never
a
night
and
never
a
morning
but
i
worried
out
of
my
life
lest
you
shall
be
thinking
of
this
summer
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
you
say
oh
you
though
i
never
left
long
in
peace
without
you
throwing
it
in
my
teeth
i
happened
to
say
hugo
one
day
by
a
slip
of
the
tongue
and
what
did
you
do
you
might
have
been
nice
and
comforted
me
to
help
me
over
it
but
you
only
scowled
and
said
you
were
not
hugo
no
i
knew
well
enough
and
i
was
ever
so
sorry
to
have
said
it
just
the
point
said
the
captain
you
really
sorry
indeed
said
fruen
hurt
me
ever
so
i
should
have
thought
it
you
do
seem
very
upset
about
it
but
what
about
you
have
you
anything
to
be
sorry
for
got
photos
of
hugo
on
your
piano
still
i
have
seen
you
move
them
away
yet
though
i
shown
you
not
once
but
fifty
times
i
wished
you
to
yes
and
begged
you
to
do
it
what
a
fuss
you
make
about
those
photos
said
she
do
make
any
mistake
i
not
asking
you
now
if
you
went
and
shifted
them
now
it
would
make
no
difference
i
begged
and
prayed
of
you
fifty
times
before
only
i
think
it
would
have
been
a
little
more
decent
if
burned
them
the
day
you
came
home
but
instead
of
that
books
here
lying
about
in
your
room
with
his
name
in
and
there
a
handkerchief
with
his
initials
on
i
see
it
all
your
jealousy
answered
fruen
ca
see
what
difference
it
makes
i
ca
kill
him
as
you
like
me
to
and
papa
and
mama
say
the
same
after
all
lived
with
him
and
been
married
to
him
to
him
what
i
say
it
is
every
one
that
looks
at
hugo
and
me
the
way
you
do
the
captain
sat
a
while
shaking
his
head
it
all
your
own
fault
really
fruen
went
on
way
you
drove
off
with
elisabet
that
time
though
i
came
and
asked
you
not
to
go
it
was
then
it
happened
and
we
been
drinking
that
evening
i
did
quite
know
what
i
was
doing
still
the
captain
said
nothing
for
a
while
then
at
last
he
said
i
ought
not
to
have
gone
off
like
that
but
you
did
said
fruen
and
started
crying
again
would
hear
a
word
and
you
always
throwing
it
in
my
teeth
about
hugo
but
you
never
think
of
what
you
done
yourself
just
this
difference
says
the
captain
i
never
lived
with
the
lady
you
mention
never
been
married
to
her
as
you
call
it
fruen
gave
a
little
scornful
laugh
said
the
captain
striking
the
table
with
his
hand
fruen
gave
a
start
and
sat
staring
at
him
i
do
understand
why
you
were
always
running
after
her
and
sitting
out
in
the
and
lurking
in
corners
said
she
was
you
that
sat
out
in
the
he
answered
yes
it
always
me
said
she
you
by
any
chance
for
my
running
after
elisabet
said
the
captain
was
solely
and
simply
in
the
hopes
of
getting
you
back
you
drifted
away
from
me
and
i
wanted
you
fruen
sat
thinking
over
that
for
a
minute
then
she
sprang
up
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
and
said
then
you
cared
for
me
all
the
time
and
i
thought
it
was
all
over
you
drifted
away
from
me
too
it
was
years
since
and
it
all
seemed
so
hopeless
i
never
thought
i
never
knew
and
then
it
was
me
you
cared
for
all
the
time
oh
my
dear
then
it
all
come
right
again
down
said
he
seem
to
forget
that
something
else
has
happened
since
else
you
are
you
forgotten
all
about
it
may
i
ask
you
are
you
sorry
enough
for
what
happened
since
at
that
fruen
turned
hard
again
and
said
you
mean
about
hugo
that
done
and
ca
be
altered
does
answer
the
question
i
sorry
enough
what
about
you
are
you
so
innocent
yourself
at
this
the
captain
got
up
and
began
walking
up
and
down
trouble
is
that
we
no
children
said
fruen
have
a
daughter
that
i
could
teach
and
bring
up
to
be
better
than
i
am
thought
of
that
said
the
captain
you
right
then
he
turned
straight
towards
her
and
said
a
nasty
crash
that
come
over
us
lovise
like
a
landslide
but
do
you
think
now
we
might
set
to
work
and
shift
away
all
the
wreckage
been
burying
us
for
years
and
get
clear
and
breathe
again
you
might
have
a
daughter
yet
at
that
fruen
got
up
and
made
as
if
to
say
something
but
could
was
all
she
said
and
she
said
again
tired
and
nervous
i
know
he
said
think
a
little
over
what
i
said
another
time
said
xi
the
captain
spoke
to
nils
about
the
timber
he
thought
of
disposing
of
the
whole
lot
or
selling
it
standing
nils
took
this
to
mean
that
he
did
like
the
idea
of
having
more
new
folk
about
the
place
it
looks
like
things
are
as
bad
as
ever
with
him
and
fruen
said
nils
we
are
getting
in
the
potatoes
now
and
since
we
are
thus
far
there
is
less
hurry
and
anxiety
about
the
work
but
there
is
still
much
to
be
done
the
ploughing
is
behindhand
and
lars
falkenberg
and
i
are
both
at
it
field
and
meadow
land
nils
queer
creature
that
he
was
began
to
find
things
intolerable
at
øvrebø
again
and
talked
of
throwing
up
his
place
and
going
off
altogether
but
he
could
bear
the
disgrace
of
leaving
his
service
like
that
nils
had
his
own
clear
notions
of
honour
handed
down
through
many
generations
a
young
man
from
a
big
farm
could
not
behave
like
a
lad
from
a
cottar
holding
and
then
he
had
been
here
long
enough
yet
øvrebø
had
been
sadly
before
he
came
it
would
take
some
years
to
bring
it
round
again
it
was
only
this
year
when
he
had
more
help
with
the
work
that
he
been
able
to
do
anything
properly
but
from
now
onward
he
might
begin
to
look
for
some
result
of
his
work
look
at
this
year
harvest
the
fine
heavy
grain
the
captain
too
had
looked
at
the
crops
with
wonder
and
thankfulness
the
first
time
for
many
years
there
would
be
plenty
to
sell
all
things
considered
then
it
was
senseless
for
nils
to
think
of
leaving
øvrebø
but
he
must
go
home
for
a
couple
of
days
to
his
people
they
lived
a
little
way
north
of
us
so
he
gave
himself
two
days
leave
as
soon
as
the
potatoes
were
all
out
of
the
ground
no
doubt
he
good
reason
for
going
perhaps
to
see
his
sweetheart
we
thought
and
when
he
came
back
he
was
bright
and
full
of
energy
as
ever
and
took
up
work
again
at
once
we
were
sitting
at
dinner
in
the
kitchen
one
day
when
out
comes
fruen
from
the
front
door
of
the
house
and
goes
tearing
down
the
road
all
wild
and
excited
then
the
captain
came
out
calling
after
her
lovise
what
is
it
lovise
where
are
you
going
but
fruen
only
called
back
leave
me
alone
we
looked
at
one
another
ragnhild
rose
from
the
table
she
must
go
after
her
mistress
she
said
that
right
said
nils
calm
as
ever
but
go
indoors
first
and
see
if
she
moved
those
they
still
there
said
ragnhild
as
she
went
out
outside
we
heard
the
captain
telling
her
to
go
and
look
after
her
mistress
there
was
no
one
but
took
thought
for
fruen
in
her
distress
we
went
out
to
the
fields
again
said
nils
to
me
she
ought
to
take
away
those
photos
it
not
right
of
her
to
leave
them
there
i
do
know
what
she
can
be
thinking
of
to
do
what
do
you
know
about
it
i
thought
to
myself
oh
i
was
so
clever
with
my
knowledge
of
the
world
and
all
i
learned
on
my
wanderings
i
thought
i
would
try
him
now
perhaps
he
was
only
showing
off
i
ca
understand
why
the
captain
has
taken
and
burnt
them
long
ago
said
i
no
that
all
wrong
said
nils
i
would
have
done
that
oh
indeed
it
would
be
for
me
to
do
it
but
for
we
walked
on
a
little
and
then
nils
said
a
thing
that
showed
his
sound
and
right
instinct
poor
lady
he
said
she
not
got
over
that
slip
of
hers
this
summer
it
troubling
her
still
from
all
i
can
see
there
some
people
pick
up
again
all
right
after
a
fall
and
go
on
through
life
with
no
more
than
the
mark
of
a
bruise
but
there
some
that
never
get
over
fruen
seems
to
be
taking
it
easy
enough
said
i
still
trying
him
how
can
we
tell
she
been
unlike
herself
to
my
mind
ever
since
she
been
back
he
answered
she
got
to
live
of
course
but
lost
all
harmony
perhaps
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
harmony
that
what
i
mean
oh
yes
she
can
eat
and
laugh
and
sleep
no
doubt
but
i
followed
one
such
to
the
grave
but
now
and
at
that
i
was
no
longer
cold
and
wise
but
foolish
and
ashamed
and
only
said
so
it
was
that
she
died
then
yes
she
wished
it
so
said
nils
and
then
suddenly
well
you
and
lars
get
on
with
the
ploughing
we
ought
soon
to
be
through
with
things
and
we
went
each
our
separate
way
i
thought
to
myself
a
sister
of
his
perhaps
that
had
gone
wrong
and
he
been
home
and
followed
her
to
the
grave
there
are
some
that
never
get
over
it
it
shakes
them
to
their
foundations
a
revolution
all
depends
on
whether
they
coarse
enough
only
the
mark
of
a
bruise
said
nils
a
sudden
thought
came
to
me
and
i
stopped
perhaps
it
was
not
his
sister
but
his
sweetheart
some
association
of
ideas
led
me
to
think
of
my
washing
i
decided
to
send
the
lad
up
for
it
it
was
evening
ragnhild
came
to
me
and
begged
me
to
keep
awake
again
there
was
dreadful
trouble
up
at
the
house
ragnhild
herself
was
greatly
upset
and
dared
not
sit
anywhere
now
in
the
but
upon
my
knees
it
was
always
so
with
her
emotion
made
her
frightened
and
tender
frightened
and
tender
yes
but
can
you
be
away
like
this
is
there
any
one
in
your
place
in
the
kitchen
i
asked
yes
cook
going
to
listen
for
the
bell
you
know
i
side
with
the
captain
she
declared
i
sided
with
him
all
oh
that
only
because
he
a
no
it
you
much
better
side
with
you
only
say
that
because
she
a
woman
answered
ragnhild
in
her
turn
but
you
do
know
all
i
do
fruen
so
unreasonable
we
care
a
bit
about
her
she
said
and
left
her
all
to
herself
whatever
might
happen
did
you
ever
hear
such
a
thing
when
i
just
gone
after
her
and
then
there
another
dreadful
thing
i
do
want
to
hear
any
more
i
said
but
i
have
been
listening
outside
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
was
there
in
the
same
room
and
heard
did
you
well
well
stay
here
till
you
calmed
down
a
little
then
we
go
and
find
and
so
frightened
and
tender
was
ragnhild
that
she
threw
her
arms
round
me
because
i
was
kind
to
her
a
strange
girl
then
we
went
down
to
nils
ragnhild
thinks
that
somebody
ought
to
keep
awake
for
a
bit
i
said
yes
said
ragnhild
oh
it
so
dreadful
worse
than
ever
it
been
heaven
knows
what
the
captain
do
perhaps
he
wo
go
to
bed
at
all
oh
she
fond
of
him
and
he
fond
of
her
too
only
all
wrong
when
she
went
running
off
like
that
today
the
captain
was
standing
outside
the
house
and
said
to
me
and
look
after
your
mistress
ragnhild
and
i
went
after
her
and
there
she
was
standing
behind
a
tree
down
the
road
and
she
just
stood
there
crying
and
smiled
at
me
i
tried
to
get
her
to
come
in
again
but
she
said
we
did
care
about
her
it
did
matter
where
she
went
captain
sent
me
after
you
said
i
he
though
she
asked
was
it
just
now
said
i
then
she
said
and
stood
quite
a
while
those
hateful
books
that
are
lying
in
my
room
and
burn
them
she
said
and
then
no
i
do
it
myself
but
i
ring
for
you
after
supper
and
then
you
must
come
up
at
once
will
said
i
and
then
i
got
her
to
come
and
you
know
said
ragnhild
suddenly
she
going
to
have
a
we
looked
at
one
another
nils
face
grew
as
it
were
veiled
beneath
a
film
of
something
indistinct
all
expression
faded
the
eyes
asleep
but
why
should
it
affect
him
so
for
the
sake
of

turned
to
ragnhild
and
asked
fruen

going
to
ring
for
you
you
said
yes
and
so
she
did
there
was
something
she
wanted
to
tell
the
captain
but
she
was
afraid
and
wanted
to
have
me
there
a
candle
and
pick
up
all
this
host
of
buttons
i
upset
she
said
and
then
she
called
out
to
the
captain
in
his
room
i
lit
the
candle
and
began
picking
up
buttons
dozens
of
them
there
were
all
sorts
the
captain
came
in
only
wanted
to
tell
you
says
fruen
at
once
it
was
kind
of
you
to
send
ragnhild
after
me

you
for
that
mind
about
that
my
dear
says
he
were
nervous

answered

trouble
is
that

have
a
daughter

could
bring
up
to
be
really
good
there
nothing

the
captain

down
on
a
chair
yes

he
said

in
that
book
there

hateful
books
ragnhild

them
away
and
burn
them
she
says
wait
i
tear
them
to
bits
now
myself
and
put
them
in
the
stove
here
and
then
she
started
pulling
them
to
pieces
taking
ever
so
many
pages
at
a
time
and
throwing
them
in
the
stove
be
so
excited
lovise
said
the
captain
nunnery
she
said
that
was
one
of
the
books
i
ca
go
into
a
nunnery
there
nothing
i
can
do
when
i
laugh
you
think
laughing
she
said
to
the
captain
i
miserable
all
the
time
and
not
laughing
a
bit
your
toothache
any
better
he
asked
that
toothache
wo
be
better
for
a
long
time
to
come
she
said
know
that
well
enough
indeed
i
do
do
know
heavens
ca
you
see
what
the
matter
with
me
said
fruen
the
captain
only
looked
at
her
and
did
not
answer
oh
you
said
today
i
might
have
a
daughter
after
all
do
you
remember
i
happened
to
look
up
at
the
captain
just
then
ragnhild
smiled
and
shook
her
head
then
she
went
on
heaven
forgive
me
for
smiling
but
the
captain
face
was
so
queer
he
stood
there
like
a
sheep
you
guess
as
much
before
asked
fruen
the
captain
looked
over
at
me
and
said
that
you
doing
there
all
this
time
asked
her
to
pick
up
those
buttons
for
me
said
fruen
finished
now
said
i
you
said
fruen
getting
up
me
see
and
she
took
the
box
and
dropped
them
again
all
over
the
floor
oh
they
went
rolling
all
over
the
place
under
the
table
under
the
bed
and
the
stove
now
did
you
ever
see
such
a
mess
said
fruen
but
then
she
went
off
again
at
once
talking
about
herself
and
said
again
i
ca
understand
you
did
you
see
i
was
see
what
was
the
matter
with
me
ca
those
buttons
wait
till
tomorrow
said
the
captain
yes
perhaps
they
can
said
fruen
then
i
be
treading
on
them
everywhere
i
ca
i
rather
afraid
of
stooping
just
now
but
never
mind
we
leave
them
for
now
she
said
and
stroked
his
hand
my
dear
my
dear
she
says
but
he
drew
his
hand
away
so
you
angry
with
me
she
said
then
why
did
you
write
and
ask
me
to
come
back
dear
lovise
we
not
alone
here
he
says
surely
you
must
know
what
made
you
write
suppose
it
was
because
i
hoped
things
would
come
right
again
they
did
no
what
was
in
your
mind
when
you
wrote
were
you
thinking
of
me
did
you
want
me
again
i
make
out
what
was
in
your
mind
finished
i
see
said
the
captain
ragnhild
and
then
you
came
away
yes
but
i
dare
not
go
far
because
of
fruen
you
may
be
sure
it
nice
for
her
when
i
was
out
of
the
room
so
i
had
to
be
somewhere
at
hand
and
if
the
captain
had
come
and
found
me
and
said
anything
have
told
him
straight
out
i
was
going
farther
away
with
fruen
in
the
state
she
was
as
it
happened
he
did
come
at
all
but
they
began
again
in
there
know
what
you
thinking
of
said
fruen
perhaps
it
not
it
would
be
your
child
oh
yes
indeed
it
might
be
so
but
god
knows
i
ca
find
words
this
moment
to
make
you
forgive
me
she
said
all
crying
my
dear
forgive
me
forgive
me
said
fruen
and
went
down
on
her
knees
on
the
floor
seen
what
i
did
with
the
books
and
that
handkerchief
with
the
initials
on
i
burnt
that
before
and
the
books
you
know
and
another
handkerchief
with
the
same
initials
on
says
the
captain
heavens
yes
you
ever
so
considerate
lovise
fruen
was
all
upset
at
that
sorry
you
should
have
seen
it
she
said
must
be
one
i
brought
back
with
me
when
i
came
home
i
have
looked
through
my
things
properly
since
but
does
it
really
matter
so
very
much
surely
no
said
he
if
you
only
listen
to
me
she
went
on
almost
certain
it
you
that
i
mean
that
the
child
is
yours
why
should
it
not
be
oh
i
do
know
how
to
say
it
down
again
said
the
captain
but
fruen
must
have
misunderstood
she
got
up
and
said
you
are
you
wo
listen
to
me
really
i
ca
make
out
why
you
ever
wrote
to
me
at
all
you
might
just
as
well
have
left
me
alone
then
the
captain
said
something
about
being
in
prison
if
a
man
grew
up
in
a
prison
yard
he
said
and
you
take
him
out
he
long
to
be
back
in
his
prison
yard
again
he
said
it
was
something
like
that
anyway
but
i
was
with
papa
and
mama
and
they
were
hard
like
you
they
said
i
had
been
married
to
him
and
were
unkind
to
me
at
all
it
is
every
one
that
looks
at
things
like
you
do
want
that
candle
alight
now
ragnhild
gone
do
you
said
the
captain
looks
so
out
of
place
to
have
it
burning
there
beside
the
lamp
as
if
it
were
ashamed
of
me
she
says
quickly
yes
that
was
what
you
meant
but
you
been
to
blame
as
well
misunderstand
me
he
says
know
i
been
to
blame
but
that
make
your
part
any
better
you
think
not
well
of
all
the
so
yours
does
count
then
i
say
i
been
to
blame
not
in
the
way
you
mean
but
in
other
ways
in
old
things
and
new
indeed
but
i
do
come
home
bringing
the
fruits
of
it
under
my
heart
to
you
says
fruen
you
know
it
was
you
all
along
that
that
did
want
us
to
have
children
and
i
did
want
it
either
but
you
ought
to
have
known
better
and
they
said
the
same
thing
at
home
if
only
i
had
a
daughter
do
let
go
over
all
that
again
says
the
captain
he
called
it
something
or
other
a
romance
i
think
it
was
it
true
says
fruen
i
ca
think
how
you
can
deny
it
not
denying
anything
do
sit
down
now
lovise
and
listen
to
me
all
this
about
having
children
and
a
daughter
to
bring
up
and
so
on
it
something
you
picked
up
lately
and
you
snatched
at
the
idea
at
once
to
save
yourself
but
you
never
said
a
word
about
wanting
children
before
not
that
i
ever
heard
but
you
ought
to
have
known
better
again
that
something
you
heard
something
new
but
it
does
matter
quite
possibly
things
might
have
been
different
if
we
had
children
i
can
see
that
myself
now
but
now
it
too
late
more
the
pity
and
here
you
are
now
like
that
heavens
yes
but
i
tell
you
it
may
be
yours
after
all
i
know
oh
said
the
captain
shaking
his
head
the
mother
should
be
the
one
to
know
but
in
this
case
it
seems
she
does
the
woman
i
married
to
does
know
or
do
you
but
fruen
did
not
answer
you
know
i
ask
you
oh
but
again
she
could
not
answer
only
slipped
down
to
the
floor
again
and
cried
really
i
know
but
perhaps
i
on
her
side
after
all
it
was
dreadful
for
her
poor
thing
and
then
i
was
just
going
to
knock
at
the
door
and
go
in
but
then
the
captain
went
on
again
ca
say
it
he
said
that
an
answer
in
itself
and
plain
enough
ca
say
more
said
fruen
she
was
still
crying
fond
of
you
for
lots
of
things
lovise
says
the
captain
one
of
them
because
you
truthful
you
she
says
have
taught
you
to
lie
as
yet
get
up
now
and
he
helped
her
up
himself
and
set
her
in
the
chair
but
it
was
pitiful
to
see
her
crying
so
cry
now
he
says
want
to
ask
you
something
shall
we
wait
and
see
what
it
like
when
it
comes
what
sort
of
eyes
it
has
and
so
on
heaven
bless
you
yes
if
you
would
oh
my
dear
god
bless
you
god
bless
you
i
try
to
bear
with
things
as
they
are
it
an
aching
misery
all
the
time
but
try
and
i
been
to
blame
as
well
bless
you
god
bless
you
she
said
again
you
he
said
now
until
tomorrow
then
fruen
leaned
down
over
the
table
and
cried
and
cried
so
dreadfully
are
you
crying
for
now
he
asked
going
she
said
i
was
afraid
of
you
before
but
now
i
ca
bear
to
be
without
you
could
you
stay
a
little
here
with
you
now
he
asked
no
i
did
mean
it
was
that
only
it
so
lonely
i
mean
said
the
captain
can
understand
i
do
feel
like
staying
any
longer
now
ring
for
the
maid
and
then
i
had
to
run
ragnhild
concluded
said
nils
after
a
while
have
they
gone
to
bed
now
ragnhild
could
not
say
yes
perhaps
anyhow
cook
was
there
in
case
but
only
think
of
it
how
dreadful
i
do
suppose
fruen
can
you
better
go
and
see
if
there
anything
you
can
yes
said
ragnhild
getting
up
but
i
side
with
the
captain
after
all
and
no
mistake
whatever
you
say
yes
that
i
it
none
so
easy
to
know
what
only
think
of
letting
that
engineer
creature
how
she
ever
could
i
do
know
and
then
to
go
down
and
stay
with
him
there
after
as
she
did
what
a
thing
to
do
and
she
all
those
handkerchiefs
of
his
ever
so
many
and
a
lot
of
her
own
are
gone
i
suppose
they
used
each
anyhow
lived
with
him
she
said
and
she
with
a
husband
of
her
own
xii
the
captain
has
done
as
he
said
about
the
timber
there
a
cracking
and
crashing
in
the
woods
already
and
a
mild
autumn
too
with
no
frost
in
the
ground
as
yet
to
stop
the
ploughing
nils
grasps
at
the
time
like
a
miser
to
save
as
much
as
possible
next
spring
now
comes
the
question
whether
grindhusen
and
i
are
to
work
on
the
timber
it
crosses
my
mind
that
i
had
intended
really
to
go
off
for
a
tramp
up
in
the
hills
and
over
the
moors
while
the
berries
were
there
what
about
that
journey
now
and
another
thing
grindhusen
was
no
longer
worth
his
keep
as
a
he
could
hold
one
end
of
a
saw
but
that
was
about
all
he
was
good
for
now
no
for
grindhusen
was
changed
somehow
devil
knows
how
it
had
come
about
he
had
not
grown
bald
at
all
his
hair
was
there
and
thick
and
red
as
ever
but
he
had
picked
up
a
deal
at
øvrebø
and
went
about
bursting
with
health
and
good
feeding
well
off
here
he
had
sent
good
sums
of
money
home
to
his
family
all
that
summer
and
autumn
and
was
full
of
praise
for
captain
and
freun
who
paid
such
good
wages
and
treated
their
folk
so
well
not
like
the
inspector
that
weighed
and
counted
every
miserable
skilling
and
then
as
true
as
god
in
heaven
go
and
take
off
two
kroner
that
he
given
as
clear
as
could
be
ugh
he
grindhusen
was
not
the
man
to
make
a
fuss
about
a
wretched
two
kroner
as
long
as
it
was
a
matter
of
any
sense
or
reason
but
to
go
and
take
it
off
like
that
fan
would
you
ever
find
the
captain
doing
such
a
thing
but
grindhusen
was
grown
so
cautious
now
and
would
even
get
properly
angry
with
any
one
even
yet
perhaps
he
might
go
back
and
work
for
the
inspector
on
the
river
at
two
kroner
a
day
and
humbly
agree
with
all
his
master
said
age
time
had
overtaken
him
it
overtakes
us
all
said
the
captain
that
you
spoke
about
is
it
too
late
to
do
anything
with
it
this
year
yes
i
answered
the
captain
nodded
and
walked
away
i
ploughed
one
day
more
then
the
captain
came
to
me
again
he
was
out
and
about
everywhere
these
days
working
hard
keeping
an
eye
on
everything
he
gave
himself
barely
time
for
a
proper
meal
but
was
out
again
at
once
in
the
fields
the
barn
the
or
up
in
the
woods
where
the
men
were
at
work
you
better
get
to
work
on
that
he
said
the
workable
still
and
may
stay
so
for
a
long
time
yet
what
help
will
you
want
grindhusen
can
help
i
said
but
yes
and
lars
what
were
you
going
to
say
the
frost
may
set
in
any
day
well
and
then
it
may
snow
and
soften
the
ground
again
we
not
here
every
year
said
the
captain
you
better
take
a
few
extra
hands
and
set
some
of
them
to
digging
the
rest
to
the
masonry
work
you
done
all
this
before
i
think
you
said
and
i
spoken
to
nils
myself
he
said
with
a
smile
so
you
have
no
trouble
in
that
way
you
can
put
the
horses
in
so
bravely
cheerful
he
was
i
could
not
help
feeling
the
same
and
wanted
to
begin
at
once
i
hurried
back
with
the
horses
almost
at
a
run
the
captain
seemed
quite
eager
about
this
now
that
the
place
looked
so
nice
with
its
new
paint
and
after
the
fine
harvest
we
had
and
now
he
was
cutting
a
thousand
dozen
battens
in
the
woods
to
pay
off
his
debts
and
leave
something
over
so
i
went
off
up
the
rising
ground
and
found
the
old
place
i
had
marked
down
long
before
for
the
reservoir
took
the
depth
down
to
the
house
pacing
and
measuring
this
way
and
that
there
was
a
streamlet
came
down
from
the
hillside
far
above
with
such
a
depth
and
fall
that
it
never
froze
in
winter
the
thing
would
be
to
build
a
small
stone
reservoir
here
with
openings
at
the
sides
for
the
overflow
in
autumn
and
spring
oh
but
they
should
have
their
at
øvrebø
as
for
the
masonry
work
we
could
break
out
our
stone
on
the
site
itself
there
was
layer
on
layer
of
granite
there
by
noon
next
day
we
were
hard
at
work
lars
falkenberg
digging
the
trench
for
the
grindhusen
and
i
getting
stone
we
were
both
well
used
to
this
work
from
the
days
when
we
had
been
together
at
skreia
well
and
good
we
worked
four
days
then
it
was
sunday
i
remember
that
sunday
the
sky
clear
and
far
the
leaves
all
fallen
in
the
woods
and
the
hillside
showing
only
its
calm
winter
green
smoke
rose
from
the
chimney
up
in
the
clearing
lars
had
borrowed
a
horse
and
cart
that
afternoon
to
drive
in
to
the
station
he
had
killed
a
pig
and
was
sending
it
in
to
town
he
was
to
fetch
letters
for
the
captain
on
the
way
back
it
occurred
to
me
that
this
evening
would
be
a
good
time
to
send
the
lad
up
to
the
clearing
for
my
washing
lars
was
away
and
no
one
could
take
offence
at
that
washing
business
now
oh
yes
i
said
to
myself
you
very
careful
to
do
what
right
and
proper
sending
the
lad
up
to
fetch
that
washing
but
you
find
it
is
that
at
all
right
and
proper
indeed
you
getting
old
what
it
is
i
bore
with
this
reproach
for
an
hour
then
well
it
was
all
nonsense
like
as
not
and
here
was
a
lovely
evening
and
sunday
into
the
bargain
nothing
to
do
no
one
to
talk
to
down
here
getting
old
was
i
afraid
of
the
walk
uphill
and
i
went
up
myself
early
next
morning
lars
falkenberg
came
over
again
he
drew
me
aside
as
he
had
done
once
before
and
with
the
same
intent
i
had
been
up
to
the
clearing
yesterday
it
seemed
it
was
to
be
the
last
time
and
would
i
please
to
make
no
mistake
about
that
it
was
the
last
of
my
washing
anyhow
i
said
oh
you
and
your
washing
as
if
i
could
have
brought
along
your
miserable
shirt
a
hundred
times
since
you
been
here
now
by
what
sort
of
magic
had
he
got
to
know
of
my
little
walk
up
there
already
ragnhild
of
course
at
her
old
tricks
again
it
could
be
no
one
else
there
was
no
doing
anything
with
that
girl
but
now
as
it
happened
nils
was
at
hand
this
time
as
he
had
been
the
time
before
he
came
strolling
over
innocently
from
the
kitchen
and
in
a
moment
lars
anger
was
turned
upon
him
instead
here
the
other
scarecrow
coming
up
too
says
lars
and
he
a
long
sight
worse
than
what
that
you
say
said
nils
what
that
you
say
retorted
lars
you
go
home
and
rinse
your
mouth
with
a
mixture
or
something
and
see
if
you
can
talk
plain
said
he
nils
stopped
short
at
this
and
came
up
to
see
what
it
was
all
about
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
said
he
no
of
course
not
you
do
know
anything
that
any
sense
but
you
know
all
about
ploughing
in
standing
crops
do
you
there
not
many
can
beat
you
at
but
here
nils
grew
angry
for
once
and
his
cheeks
paled
what
an
utter
fool
you
are
lars
ca
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
with
that
nonsense
fool
eh
hark
at
the
silly
goat
said
lars
turning
to
me
thinks
himself
mighty
fine
does
he
he
says
and
goes
white
about
it
i
been
more
years
than
you
at
øvrebø
and
asked
in
to
sing
up
at
the
house
of
an
evening
more
than
once
let
me
tell
you
but
things
have
changed
since
then
and
what
have
we
got
instead
you
remember
he
said
turning
to
me
what
it
was
like
in
the
old
days
it
was
lars
here
and
lars
there
and
i
never
heard
but
the
work
got
done
all
right
and
after
me
it
was
albert
that
was
here
for
eighteen
months
but
then
you
nils
came
along
and
now
it
toil
and
moil
and
ploughing
and
carting
manure
day
and
night
till
a
man
worn
to
a
thread
with
it
nils
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
and
lars
was
in
no
way
offended
he
seemed
quite
pleased
at
having
said
something
funny
and
forgetting
his
joined
in
the
laugh
himself
yes
i
say
it
straight
out
said
he
and
if
it
was
for
you
being
a
friendly
sort
between
whiles
no
friendly
i
wo
say
but
someways
decent
and
to
get
on
with
after
a
fashion
if
it
was
for
that
well
what
then
lars
was
getting
more
and
more
good
humoured
oh
he
said
with
a
laugh
i
could
just
pick
you
up
and
stuff
you
down
in
your
own
long
like
to
feel
my
arm
said
nils
what
going
on
here
asked
the
captain
coming
up
it
was
only
six
but
he
was
out
and
about
already
nothing
said
lars
and
nils
as
well
how
the
reservoir
getting
on
asked
the
captain
this
was
to
me
but
before
i
could
answer
he
turned
to
nils
i
shall
want
the
boy
to
drive
me
to
the
station
he
said
i
going
to
grindhusen
and
i
went
off
to
our
work
on
the
reservoir
and
lars
to
his
digging
but
a
shadow
seemed
to
have
fallen
over
us
all
grindhusen
himself
said
openly
pity
the
captain
going
i
thought
so
too
but
he
was
obliged
to
go
in
on
business
no
doubt
there
were
the
crops
as
well
as
the
timber
to
be
sold
but
why
should
he
start
at
that
hour
of
the
day
he
could
catch
the
early
train
in
any
case
had
there
been
trouble
again
was
he
anxious
to
be
out
of
the
way
before
fruen
got
up
trouble
there
was
often
enough
it
had
gone
so
far
by
this
time
that
the
captain
and
fruen
hardly
spoke
to
one
another
and
whenever
they
did
exchange
a
word
it
was
in
a
careless
tone
and
looking
all
the
other
way
now
and
again
the
captain
would
look
his
wife
properly
in
the
face
and
say
she
ought
to
be
out
more
in
the
lovely
air
and
once
when
she
was
outside
he
asked
if
she
would
come
in
and
play
a
little
but
this
perhaps
was
only
to
keep
up
appearances
no
more
it
was
pitiful
to
see
fruen
was
quiet
and
nice
now
and
again
she
would
stand
outside
on
the
steps
looking
out
towards
the
hills
so
soft
her
features
were
and
her
reddish
yellow
hair
but
it
was
dull
for
her
now
no
visitors
no
music
and
entertaining
nothing
but
sorrow
and
shame
the
captain
had
promised
to
bear
with
things
as
they
were
and
surely
he
was
bearing
all
he
could
but
he
could
do
no
more
disaster
had
come
to
the
home
and
the
best
will
in
the
world
could
not
shoulder
it
off
if
fruen
happened
to
be
hasty
as
she
might
now
and
then
and
forgot
to
be
grateful
the
captain
would
look
down
at
the
floor
and
it
would
not
be
long
before
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
out
all
the
maids
knew
about
it
and
i
had
seen
it
myself
once
or
twice
he
never
forgot
what
she
had
done
how
could
he
though
he
could
keep
from
speaking
of
it
but
could
he
keep
from
speaking
of
it
when
she
forgot
herself
and
said
you
know
i
not
well
just
now
you
know
i
ca
walk
far
like
i
used
to
s
sh
lovise
he
would
say
with
a
frown
and
then
the
mischief
was
there
as
bad
as
ever
oh
of
course
you
must
bring
that
up
again
no
indeed
it
you
that
brought
it
up
yourself
you
lost
all
sense
of
modesty
i
think
you
seem
to
have
no
shame
oh
i
wish
i
never
come
back
at
all
i
was
better
off
at
home
yes
or
living
with
that
puppy
i
dare
you
said
he
helped
you
once
yourself
and
i
often
wish
i
were
back
there
with
him
again
hugo
a
great
deal
better
than
you
she
was
all
irresponsible
in
her
words
going
perhaps
further
than
she
meant
but
she
was
changed
out
of
knowledge
to
us
all
and
spoiled
and
shameless
now
fru
falkenberg
shameless
nay
perhaps
not
who
could
say
yet
she
was
not
ashamed
to
come
out
in
the
kitchen
of
an
evening
and
say
nice
things
to
nils
about
how
young
and
strong
he
was
i
was
jealous
again
no
doubt
and
envied
nils
for
his
youth
for
i
thought
to
myself
is
every
one
gone
mad
surely
we
older
ones
are
far
to
be
preferred
was
it
his
innocence
that
attracted
her
or
was
she
merely
trying
to
keep
up
her
spirits
a
little
trying
to
be
younger
than
she
was
but
then
one
day
she
came
up
to
the
reservoir
where
grindhusen
and
i
were
at
work
and
sat
watching
us
for
a
while
it
was
easy
work
then
for
half
an
hour
the
granite
turned
pliable
and
yielded
to
our
will
we
built
away
like
giants
oh
but
fruen
sat
there
irresponsible
as
ever
letting
her
eyes
play
this
way
and
that
why
could
she
not
rid
herself
of
this
new
habit
of
hers
her
eyes
were
too
earnest
for
such
playing
it
did
not
suit
her
i
thought
to
myself
either
she
was
trying
to
make
up
for
her
foolishness
towards
nils
by
favouring
us
in
turn
or
starting
a
new
game
altogether
which
would
it
be
i
could
not
make
it
out
and
as
for
grindhusen
he
saw
nothing
in
it
at
all
but
only
said
when
fruen
had
gone
eh
she
a
strange
soul
is
fruen
almost
like
a
mother
only
fancy
going
and
feeling
if
the
water
too
cold
for
us
one
day
when
i
was
standing
by
the
kitchen
entrance
she
said
do
you
remember
the
old
days
here
when
you
first
came
she
had
never
once
spoken
of
this
till
now
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
say
i
stammered
out
yes
i
remembered
you
drove
me
down
to
the
vicarage
once
she
said
then
i
half
fancied
that
perhaps
she
was
not
disinclined
to
talk
to
me
and
occupy
her
mind
a
little
i
felt
i
must
help
her
make
it
easier
for
her
and
perhaps
i
was
a
little
touched
myself
at
the
thought
yes
i
said
i
remember
it
was
a
glorious
drive
but
fruen
must
have
found
it
cold
towards
the
it
was
you
that
must
have
felt
cold
she
answered
you
lent
me
your
own
rug
from
the
box
oh
you
poor
thing
i
was
even
more
moved
at
this
and
foolish
ideas
came
into
my
head
ah
then
she
had
not
forgotten
me
the
few
years
that
had
passed
since
then
had
not
made
so
much
difference
in
me
after
all
fruen
must
be
mistaken
about
the
rug
i
think
said
i
but
i
remember
we
stopped
at
a
cottage
to
eat
and
the
woman
made
coffee
and
you
gave
me
things
as
i
spoke
i
leaned
up
against
the
fence
with
my
arms
round
a
post
perhaps
this
somehow
offended
her
looking
as
if
i
expected
her
to
stand
gossiping
there
with
me
and
then
i
had
said
we
stopped
at
a
cottage
as
if
we
had
been
equals
it
was
a
bad
mistake
on
my
part
of
course
but
i
had
got
a
little
out
of
hand
after
all
these
vagabond
months
i
stood
up
straight
again
the
moment
i
saw
she
was
displeased
but
it
was
too
late
she
was
just
as
kind
as
ever
but
she
had
grown
suspicious
and
easily
hurt
with
all
her
trouble
and
found
rudeness
in
what
was
merely
awkwardness
of
mine
well
well
she
said
i
hope
you
find
yourself
as
comfortable
now
at
øvrebø
as
and
she
nodded
and
walked
away
some
days
passed
the
captain
had
not
come
back
but
he
had
sent
a
post
card
with
a
kind
message
to
fruen
he
hoped
to
be
home
again
next
week
he
was
also
sending
pipes
taps
and
cement
for
the
water
supply
fruen
showed
me
that
card
here
she
said
the
captain
has
sent
these
things
for
your
work
you
had
better
get
them
down
from
the
we
stood
there
together
looking
at
the
card
it
was
and
we
were
just
outside
the
house
i
ca
say
how
it
was
but
i
was
standing
there
quite
close
to
her
with
my
head
bent
in
towards
hers
and
it
made
me
feel
happy
all
through
when
she
had
finished
reading
she
looked
up
at
me
no
play
of
her
eyes
now
but
she
must
have
caught
some
expression
in
my
face
for
she
looked
at
me
still
did
she
feel
my
presence
as
i
felt
hers
those
two
heavy
eyes
raised
towards
mine
and
held
there
were
loaded
to
the
brim
with
love
she
could
not
be
responsible
for
her
actions
now
there
was
a
pathological
depth
in
her
glance
an
influence
from
far
within
from
the
life
she
bore
under
her
heart
her
breath
came
heavily
her
face
flushed
dark
all
over
then
she
swung
round
and
walked
slowly
away
there
i
stood
with
the
card
in
my
hand
had
she
given
it
to
me
had
i
taken
it
your
card
i
said
shall
i
she
held
out
her
hand
without
looking
round
and
walked
on
this
little
episode
occupied
my
mind
a
great
deal
for
some
days
ought
i
to
have
gone
after
her
when
she
walked
away
oh
i
might
have
tried
might
have
made
the
attempt
her
door
was
not
far
off
pathological
but
what
had
she
brought
me
the
card
for
at
all
she
could
have
told
me
by
word
of
mouth
what
there
was
to
say
i
called
to
mind
how
six
years
before
we
had
stood
in
just
that
same
way
reading
a
telegram
the
captain
had
sent
her
did
she
find
pleasure
in
situations
of
that
sort
and
go
out
of
her
way
to
seek
them
next
time
i
saw
her
there
was
no
trace
of
any
embarassment
in
her
manner
she
was
kind
and
cold
so
i
had
to
let
it
drop
altogether
and
anyhow
what
did
i
want
with
her
at
all
no
indeed
some
visitors
came
to
see
her
one
day
a
neighbour
wife
with
her
daughter
they
had
heard
no
doubt
that
the
captain
was
away
and
thought
she
might
be
glad
of
a
little
society
or
perhaps
they
had
come
out
of
curiosity
they
were
well
received
fru
falkenberg
was
amiable
as
ever
and
even
played
the
piano
for
them
when
they
left
she
went
with
them
down
to
the
road
talking
sensibly
of
practical
affairs
though
she
might
well
have
had
other
things
in
her
head
than
coops
and
killing
pigs
oh
she
was
full
of
kindly
interest
in
it
all
come
again
soon
or
you
at
any
rate
sofie
thanks
thanks
but
are
you
ever
coming
over
to
us
at
nedrebø
oh
i
of
course
yes
i
walk
down
with
you
now
if
it
were
so
well
tomorrow
then
yes
perhaps
i
might
come
over
oh
is
that
you
this
was
to
ragnhild
who
had
come
down
with
a
shawl
oh
what
an
idea
did
you
think
i
should
catch
cold
altogether
things
were
looking
brighter
now
at
øvrebø
we
no
longer
felt
that
shadow
of
uneasiness
over
us
all
grindhusen
and
i
worked
away
at
our
famous
reservoir
and
lars
was
getting
on
farther
every
day
with
his
trench
seeing
the
captain
was
away
i
wanted
to
make
the
most
of
the
time
and
perhaps
have
the
work
nearly
done
by
the
time
he
came
back
it
would
be
a
grand
thing
if
we
could
get
it
finished
altogether
he
would
be
all
the
better
for
a
pleasant
little
surprise
for
yes
there
had
been
something
of
a
scene
the
night
before
he
left
some
new
reminder
no
doubt
of
the
trouble
that
had
come
upon
his
house
a
book
perhaps
still
unburnt
lying
about
in
fruen
room
he
had
ended
up
by
saying
anyhow
i
cutting
timber
now
to
pay
it
off
and
the
harvest
got
in
means
a
lot
of
money
so
i
hope
the
lord
will
forgive
me
as
i
do
him
when
we
had
laid
the
last
stone
of
the
reservoir
and
cement
over
all
i
went
down
with
grindhusen
to
help
lars
with
the
trench
we
took
a
section
each
the
work
went
on
easily
and
with
a
will
here
and
there
a
stone
had
to
be
blasted
out
or
a
tree
felled
up
in
the
woods
but
the
trench
moved
steadily
upwards
until
we
had
a
long
black
line
from
the
house
to
the
reservoir
itself
then
we
went
back
again
and
dug
it
out
to
the
proper
depth
this
was
no
ornamental
work
but
a
trench
an
underground
resting
place
for
some
pipes
that
were
to
be
buried
on
the
spot
all
we
were
concerned
with
was
to
get
down
below
the
reach
of
frost
and
that
before
the
frost
itself
came
to
hinder
us
already
it
was
coating
the
fields
at
night
nils
himself
left
all
else
now
and
came
to
lend
a
hand
but
masonry
and
digging
trenches
are
but
work
for
the
hands
my
brain
in
its
idleness
was
busy
all
the
while
with
every
conceivable
idea
as
often
as
i
thought
of
that
episode
with
the
post
card
it
sent
as
it
were
a
glow
all
through
me
why
should
i
think
any
more
about
it
no
of
course
not
and
i
had
not
followed
her
to
the
door
after
all
but
there
she
stood
and
you
there
her
breath
came
towards
you
a
taste
of
flesh
out
of
a
darkness
she
was
nay
not
of
earth
and
her
eyes
did
you
mark
her
eyes
and
each
time
something
in
me
turned
at
the
thought
a
nausea
a
meaningless
succession
of
names
poured
in
upon
me
places
of
wild
and
tender
sound
whence
she
might
be
uganda
antananarivo
honolulu
venezuela
atacama
verse

i
knew
not
what
to
do
with
the
words
xiii
fruen
has
ordered
the
carriage
to
drive
her
to
the
station
no
sign
of
haste
in
her
manner
she
gives
orders
to
the
cook
about
packing
up
some
food
for
the
journey
and
when
nils
asks
which
carriage
he
is
to
take
she
thinks
for
a
moment
and
decides
to
take
the
landau
and
pair
so
she
went
away
nils
himself
drove
for
her
they
came
back
the
same
evening
they
had
turned
back
when
out
had
fruen
forgotten
something
she
ordered
fresh
horses
and
another
hamper
of
food
she
was
going
off
again
at
once
nils
was
uneasy
and
said
so
it
was
almost
night
they
would
be
driving
in
the
dark
but
fruen
repeated
her
order
meantime
she
sat
indoors
and
waited
she
had
not
forgotten
anything
she
did
nothing
now
but
sit
staring
before
her
ragnhild
went
in
and
asked
if
there
was
anything
she
could
do
no
thank
you
fruen
sat
bowed
forward
as
if
weighted
down
by
some
deadly
grief
the
carriage
was
ready
and
fruen
came
out
seeing
nils
himself
ready
to
drive
again
she
took
pity
on
him
and
said
she
would
have
grindhusen
to
drive
this
time
and
she
sat
on
the
steps
till
he
came
then
they
drove
off
it
was
a
fine
evening
and
nice
and
cool
for
the
horses
she
past
making
out
now
said
nils
i
ca
think
what
come
to
her
i
no
idea
of
anything
when
suddenly
she
taps
at
the
window
and
says
turn
back
we
were
about
there
but
never
a
word
of
starting
out
again
at
but
she
must
have
forgotten
something
surely
ragnhild
says
no
she
was
indoors
and
i
thought
for
a
moment
of
those
photograph
things
if
she
was
going
to
burn
them
but
they
still
there
no
she
did
do
a
single
thing
while
she
was
we
walked
across
the
courtyard
together
no
nils
went
on
fruen
in
a
bad
way
she
lost
all
harmony
for
everything
where
she
going
off
to
now
do
you
think
heaven
knows
she
does
seem
to
be
altogether
sure
of
it
herself
when
we
stopped
to
breathe
the
horses
she
said
something
about
being
in
such
a
hurry
and
having
to
be
in
different
places
at
once
and
then
she
ought
not
really
to
be
away
from
home
at
all
for
fruen
not
to
hurry
about
anything
i
said
just
keep
quiet
but
you
know
how
she
is
nowadays
there
no
saying
a
word
to
her
she
just
looked
at
her
watch
and
said
go
on
was
this
on
the
way
to
the
station
no
on
the
way
back
she
was
quite
excited
i
perhaps
the
captain
sent
for
her
nils
shook
his
head
no
but
perhaps
lord
knows
what
was
i
going
to
say
it
tomorrow
sunday
is
it
yes
what
then
oh
nothing
i
was
only
thinking
i
use
the
day
off
to
mark
out
firewood
for
the
winter
i
been
thinking
of
that
a
long
while
and
it
easier
now
than
when
the
snow
always
thinking
of
his
work
was
nils
he
took
a
pride
in
it
and
was
anxious
now
moreover
to
show
his
gratitude
for
the
captain
having
raised
his
wages
since
the
harvest
it
is
sunday
i
walked
up
to
have
a
look
at
the
trench
and
the
reservoir
a
few
more
good
days
now
and
we
should
have
the
pipes
laid
down
i
was
quite
excited
about
it
myself
and
could
hardly
wait
for
to
begin
again
the
captain
had
not
interfered
in
the
arrangements
not
with
a
single
word
but
left
all
to
me
so
that
it
was
no
light
matter
to
me
if
the
frost
came
now
and
upset
it
all
when
i
got
back
there
was
the
landau
outside
the
house
the
horses
had
been
taken
out
grindhusen
would
about
have
had
time
to
get
back
i
thought
but
why
had
he
pulled
up
in
front
of
the
steps
to
the
house
i
went
into
the
kitchen
the
maids
came
towards
me
fruen
was
in
the
carriage
they
said
had
come
back
once
again
she
had
just
been
to
the
station
but
now
she
was
going
there
again
could
i
make
out
what
was
the
matter
with
her
now
nervous
i
expect
said
i
where
nils
up
in
the
woods
said
he
be
away
some
time
there
only
us
here
now
and
we
ca
say
more
to
her
than
we
and
where
grindhusen
changing
the
horses
again
and
fruen
sitting
there
in
the
carriage
and
wo
get
out
you
go
and
speak
to
oh
well
there
no
great
harm
in
her
driving
about
a
bit
do
worry
about
i
went
out
to
the
carriage
my
heart
beating
fast
how
miserable
and
desperate
she
must
be
i
opened
the
carriage
door
and
asked
respectfully
if
fruen
would
let
me
drive
this
time
she
looked
me
calmly
in
the
face
no
what
for
she
said
grindhusen
might
be
a
little
done
up
perhaps
i
do
know
he
promised
to
drive
she
said
and
he
not
done
up
is
he
nearly
ready
i
ca
see
him
i
answered
shut
the
door
again
and
tell
him
to
come
she
commanded
wrapping
herself
more
closely
as
she
spoke
i
went
over
to
the
stables
grindhusen
was
harnessing
a
fresh
pair
of
horses
what
all
this
i
asked
going
off
again
are
you
yes
that
is
i
thought
so
said
grindhusen
stopping
for
a
moment
as
if
in
doubt
it
looks
queer
where
fruen
going
to
do
you
know
no
she
wanted
to
drive
back
again
last
night
as
soon
as
we
got
to
the
station
but
i
told
her
that
it
was
too
much
for
either
of
us
to
drive
back
then
so
she
slept
at
the
hotel
but
this
morning
it
was
home
again
if
you
please
and
now
she
wants
to
go
to
the
station
again
she
says
i
do
know
i
sure
grindhusen
goes
on
harnessing
up
fruen
said
you
were
to
make
haste
i
said
all
right
i
coming
but
these
girths
are
the
very
are
you
too
tired
to
drive
all
that
way
again
now
no
you
know
well
enough
i
can
manage
it
all
right
and
she
given
me
good
money
too
did
she
though
ay
that
she
did
but
she
a
queer
sort
is
then
said
i
i
do
think
you
ought
to
go
off
again
grindhusen
stopped
short
you
think
so
well
now
i
dare
say
just
then
came
fruen
voice
from
outside
she
had
come
right
over
to
the
stable
door
are
you
ready
yet
how
much
longer
am
i
to
sit
waiting
ready
this
minute
answered
grindhusen
and
turned
to
again
busier
than
ever
it
was
only
these
fruen
went
back
to
the
carriage
she
ran
and
the
thick
fur
coat
she
had
on
was
too
heavy
for
her
she
had
to
balance
with
her
arms
it
was
pitiful
to
see
like
a
hen
trying
to
escape
across
the
barnyard
and
flapping
its
wings
to
help
i
went
over
to
the
carriage
again
politely
even
humbly
i
took
off
my
cap
and
begged
fruen
to
give
up
this
new
journey
you
are
not
driving
me
she
answered
no
but
if
fruen
would
only
give
it
up
and
stay
at
home
at
this
she
was
offended
she
stared
at
me
looked
me
up
and
down
and
said
excuse
me
but
this
is
no
business
of
yours
because
i
got
you
dismissed
once
no
no
it
not
that
i
cried
desperately
and
could
say
no
more
when
she
took
it
that
way
i
was
helpless
just
for
one
moment
a
wave
of
fury
came
over
me
i
had
only
to
put
out
my
arms
and
i
could
lift
her
out
of
the
carriage
altogether
this
child
this
pitiful
hen
my
arms
must
have
twitched
at
the
thought
for
she
gave
a
sudden
frightened
start
and
shifted
in
her
seat
then
all
at
once
the
reaction
took
me
i
turned
foolish
and
soft
and
tried
once
more
it
be
so
dismal
for
us
all
here
if
you
go
do
let
us
try
if
we
ca
hit
on
something
between
us
to
pass
the
time
for
you
i
can
read
a
little
reading
aloud
and
there
lars
can
sing
perhaps
i
might
tell
stories
tell
of
something
or
other
here
grindhusen
coming
wo
you
let
me
tell
him
you
not
going
after
all
she
softened
at
this
and
sat
thinking
for
a
little
then
she
said
you
must
be
making
a
mistake
altogether
i
think
i
am
going
to
the
station
to
meet
the
captain
he
did
come
the
first
day
or
yesterday
either
but
he
sure
to
come
some
time
i
driving
over
to
meet
oh
there
you
are
now
go
is
grindhusen
there
it
was
like
a
slap
in
the
face
for
me
she
was
right
it
sounded
so
natural
oh
i
had
made
a
fool
of
myself
again
yes
here
he
is
i
answered
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
and
i
put
on
my
cap
again
and
helped
grindhusen
myself
with
the
harness
so
confused
and
shamed
was
i
that
i
did
not
even
ask
pardon
but
only
fretted
this
way
and
that
way
seeing
to
buckles
and
straps
you
are
driving
then
grindhusen
called
fruen
from
the
carriage
me
yes
surely
he
answered
fruen
pulled
the
door
to
with
a
bang
and
the
carriage
drove
off
has
she
gone
asked
the
maids
clasping
their
hands
gone
yes
of
course
she
going
to
meet
her
i
strolled
up
to
the
reservoir
again
grindhusen
away
meant
one
man
less
why
then
the
rest
of
us
must
work
so
much
the
harder
but
i
had
already
come
to
realize
that
fru
falkenberg
had
only
silenced
me
with
a
false
excuse
when
she
declared
she
was
going
to
meet
her
husband
what
matter
the
horses
were
rested
they
had
done
no
work
the
days
nils
had
been
helping
us
with
the
trench
but
i
had
been
a
fool
i
could
have
got
up
on
the
box
myself
without
asking
leave
well
and
what
then
why
then
at
least
any
later
follies
would
have
had
to
pass
by
way
of
me
more
or
less
and
i
might
have
stopped
them
he
he
infatuated
old
fool
fruen
knew
what
she
was
doing
no
doubt
she
wanted
to
pay
off
old
scores
and
be
away
when
her
husband
came
home
she
was
all
indecision
would
and
would
not
would
and
would
not
all
the
time
but
the
idea
was
there
and
i
simple
soul
i
had
not
set
out
on
purpose
to
attend
to
the
particular
interests
of
married
folk
in
love
or
out
of
it
was
their
affair
fru
falkenberg
had
changed
for
the
worse
there
was
no
denying
it
she
had
suffered
damage
and
was
thoroughly
spoiled
now
it
hardly
mattered
any
longer
what
she
did
ay
and
she
had
taken
to
lying
as
well
first
tricks
with
her
eyes
then
on
till
it
got
to
lying
a
white
lie
today
tomorrow
a
blacker
one
each
leading
to
another
and
what
of
it
life
could
afford
to
waste
her
to
throw
her
away
we
put
in
three
days
work
at
the
trench
only
a
few
feet
left
now
there
might
be
three
degrees
of
frost
now
at
nights
but
it
did
not
stop
us
we
went
steadily
on
grindhusen
had
come
back
and
was
set
to
tunnelling
under
the
kitchen
where
the
pipes
were
to
go
but
the
stable
and
cowshed
was
more
important
and
i
did
the
underground
work
for
these
myself
nils
and
lars
ran
the
last
bit
of
trech
up
meanwhile
the
last
bit
of
way
to
the
reservoir
today
at
last
i
questioned
grindhusen
about
fruen
so
you
did
bring
fruen
back
with
you
again
this
last
time
no
she
went
off
by
off
to
her
husband
i
suppose
but
grindhusen
has
turned
cautious
with
me
these
two
days
past
he
has
said
never
a
word
and
now
he
only
answers
vaguely
ay
that
would
be
it
no
doubt
ay
surely
yes
why
you
might
reckon
that
out
yourself
she
would
her
own
husband
and
all
i
thought
perhaps
she
might
have
been
going
up
to
her
own
people
at
why
that
might
be
says
grindhusen
thinking
this
a
better
way
lord
yes
that
would
be
it
of
course
just
for
a
visit
like
well
well
she
be
home
again
soon
for
did
she
tell
you
so
why
was
so
i
made
out
and
the
captain
not
home
himself
yet
anyway
eh
but
she
a
rare
openhanded
one
she
is
something
for
food
and
drink
for
yourself
and
the
horses
she
says
here
a
little
extra
she
says
again
eh
but
there
never
her
like
but
to
the
maids
with
whom
he
felt
less
fear
grindhusen
had
said
it
did
look
as
if
they
be
seeing
fruen
back
again
at
all
she
had
been
asking
him
all
the
way
he
said
about
engineer
lassen
she
must
have
gone
off
to
him
after
all
and
surely
she
be
well
enough
with
him
a
man
with
any
amount
of
money
and
grand
style
and
all
then
came
another
card
for
fruen
from
the
captain
this
time
only
to
say
would
she
please
send
nils
to
meet
him
at
the
station
on
friday
and
be
sure
to
bring
his
fur
coat
the
post
card
had
been
delayed
it
was
thursday
already
and
this
time
it
was
fortunate
really
that
ragnhild
happened
to
look
at
the
post
card
and
see
what
it
said
we
stayed
sitting
in
nils
room
talking
about
the
captain
what
he
would
say
when
he
got
back
and
what
we
should
say
or
if
we
ought
to
say
anything
at
all
all
three
of
the
maids
were
present
at
this
council
fruen
would
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
get
to
kristiania
herself
by
the
day
the
captain
had
written
his
card
she
had
not
it
seemed
she
had
gone
somewhere
else
it
was
more
than
pitiful
altogether
said
nils
did
she
leave
a
note
or
anything
when
she
went
but
no
there
was
nothing
ragnhild
however
had
done
a
thing
on
her
own
responsibility
which
perhaps
she
ought
not
to
have
done
she
had
taken
the
photos
from
the
piano
and
thrown
them
in
the
stove
was
it
wrong
now
no
no
ragnhild
no
she
told
us
also
that
she
had
been
through
fruen
wardrobe
and
sorted
out
all
handkerchiefs
that
were
not
hers
oh
she
had
found
lots
of
things
up
in
her
room
a
bag
with
engineer
lassen
initials
worked
on
a
book
with
his
full
name
in
some
sweets
in
an
envelope
with
his
writing
and
she
had
burnt
it
all
a
strange
girl
ragnhild
yes
was
there
ever
such
an
instinct
as
hers
it
was
like
the
devil
turned
monk
ragnhild
who
made
such
use
herself
of
the
thick
red
and
the
keyholes
everywhere
it
suited
me
and
my
work
well
enough
that
the
captain
had
not
ordered
the
carriage
before
we
had
got
the
trench
finished
now
all
the
way
up
and
i
could
manage
without
nils
for
laying
the
pipes
i
should
want
all
hands
though
when
it
came
to
filling
in
again
it
was
rain
again
now
by
the
way
mild
weather
many
degrees
of
warmth
it
was
well
for
me
no
doubt
these
days
that
i
had
this
work
of
mine
to
occupy
my
thoughts
as
keenly
as
it
did
it
kept
away
many
a
fancy
that
would
surely
otherwise
have
plagued
me
now
and
again
i
would
clench
my
fists
as
a
spasm
of
pain
came
over
me
and
when
i
was
all
alone
up
at
the
reservoir
i
could
sometimes
cry
aloud
up
at
the
woods
but
there
was
no
possibility
of
my
getting
away
and
where
should
i
go
if
i
did
the
captain
arrived
he
went
all
through
the
house
at
once
into
the
parlour
out
into
the
kitchen
then
to
the
rooms
upstairs
in
his
fur
coat
and
overboots
where
fruen
he
asked
fruen
went
to
meet
captain
answered
ragnhild
we
thought
she
be
coming
back
now
as
the
captain
head
bowed
forward
a
little
then
cautiously
he
began
questioning
you
mean
she
drove
with
nils
to
the
station
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
looked
about
while
i
was
there
no
said
ragnhild
it
was
sunday
fruen
at
this
the
captain
pulled
himself
together
sunday
he
said
then
she
must
have
been
going
to
meet
me
in
kristiania
h
we
managed
to
miss
each
other
somehow
i
had
to
make
another
little
journey
yesterday
out
to
drammen
no
frederikstad
i
mean
get
me
something
to
eat
will
you
værsaagod
it
already
it
was
the
day
before
yesterday
by
the
way
i
went
out
there
well
well
she
have
had
a
little
outing
anyhow
and
how
everything
going
on
are
the
men
at
work
on
the
trench
they
finished
it
i
the
captain
went
in
and
ragnhild
came
running
at
once
to
tell
us
what
he
had
said
that
we
might
know
what
to
go
by
now
and
not
make
things
worse
later
in
the
day
he
came
out
to
where
we
were
at
work
greeted
us
cheerily
in
military
fashion
and
was
surprised
to
find
the
pipes
already
laid
we
had
begun
filling
in
now
splendid
he
said
you
fellows
are
quicker
at
your
work
than
i
he
went
off
by
himself
up
to
the
reservoir
when
he
came
back
his
eyes
were
not
so
keen
he
looked
a
little
weary
maybe
he
had
been
sitting
there
alone
and
thinking
of
many
things
he
stood
watching
us
now
with
one
hand
to
his
chin
after
a
little
he
said
to
nils
i
sold
the
timber
captain
got
a
good
price
for
it
maybe
yes
a
good
price
but
i
been
all
this
time
about
it
you
been
quicker
there
are
more
of
us
here
i
said
four
of
us
some
and
at
that
he
tried
to
jest
yes
he
said
i
know
you
an
expensive
man
to
have
about
the
place
but
there
was
no
jest
in
his
face
his
smile
was
hardly
a
smile
at
all
the
weakness
had
gripped
him
now
in
earnest
after
a
little
he
sat
down
on
a
stone
we
had
just
got
out
all
over
fresh
clay
as
it
was
and
watched
us
i
took
up
my
spade
and
went
up
thinking
of
his
clothes
had
i
better
scrape
the
stone
a
bit
clean
no
it
does
matter
he
said
but
he
got
up
all
the
same
and
let
me
clean
it
a
little
it
was
then
that
ragnhild
came
running
up
to
us
following
the
line
of
the
trench
she
had
something
in
her
hand
a
paper
and
she
was
running
running
the
captain
sat
watching
her
it
only
a
telegram
she
said
breathlessly
it
came
on
by
the
captain
got
up
and
strode
quickly
a
few
paces
forward
toward
this
telegram
that
had
come
then
he
tore
it
open
and
read
we
could
see
at
once
it
must
be
something
important
the
captain
gave
a
great
gasp
then
he
began
walking
down
running
down
towards
the
house
a
little
way
off
he
turned
round
and
called
to
nils
the
carriage
at
once
i
must
go
to
the
station
then
he
ran
on
again
so
the
captain
went
away
again
he
had
only
been
home
a
few
hours
ragnhild
told
us
of
his
terrible
haste
and
worry
poor
man
he
was
getting
into
the
carriage
without
his
fur
coat
and
would
have
left
the
food
behind
him
that
was
packed
all
ready
and
the
telegram
that
had
come
was
lying
all
open
on
the
stairs
accident
it
said
your
chief
of
what
was
all
this
i
thought
as
much
said
ragnhild
when
they
sent
it
on
by
her
voice
was
strange
and
she
turned
away
something
serious
i
dare
say
she
said
no
no
said
i
reading
and
reading
again
look
it
not
so
very
bad
hear
what
it
says
you
come
at
once
accident
to
your
wife
it
was
an
express
telegram
from
the
little
town
the
little
dead
town
yes
that
was
it
a
town
with
a
roar
of
sound
through
it
and
a
long
bridge
and
foaming
waters
all
cries
there
died
as
they
were
uttered
none
could
hear
and
there
were
no
birds
but
all
the
maids
spoke
now
in
changed
voices
was
nothing
but
misery
amongst
us
now
i
had
to
appear
steady
and
confident
myself
to
reassure
them
fruen
might
have
had
a
fall
perhaps
she
was
not
as
active
of
late
but
she
could
perhaps
have
got
up
again
and
walked
on
almost
as
well
as
ever
just
a
little
bleeding
oh
they
were
so
quick
with
their
telegrams
these
police
folk
no
no
said
ragnhild
you
know
well
enough
that
when
the
chief
of
police
sends
a
telegram
it
pretty
sure
to
mean
fruen
been
found
dead
somewhere
oh
i
ca
i
ca
ca
bear
it
miserable
days
i
worked
away
harder
than
ever
but
as
a
man
in
his
sleep
without
interest
or
pleasure
would
the
captain
never
come
three
days
later
he
came
quietly
and
alone
the
body
had
been
sent
to
kristianssand
he
had
only
come
back
to
fetch
some
clothes
then
he
was
going
on
there
himself
to
the
funeral
he
was
home
this
time
for
an
hour
at
most
then
off
again
to
catch
the
early
train
i
did
not
even
see
him
myself
being
out
at
work
ragnhild
asked
if
he
had
seen
fruen
alive
he
looked
at
her
and
frowned
but
the
girl
would
not
give
up
she
begged
him
for
heaven
sake
to
say
and
the
two
other
maids
stood
just
behind
as
desperate
as
she
then
the
captain
answered
but
in
a
low
voice
as
if
to
himself
she
had
been
dead
some
days
when
i
got
there
it
was
an
accident
she
had
tried
to
cross
the
river
and
the
ice
would
not
bear
no
no
there
was
no
ice
but
the
stones
were
slippery
there
was
ice
as
well
then
the
maids
began
moaning
and
crying
but
this
was
more
than
he
could
stand
he
got
up
from
the
chair
where
he
was
sitting
cleared
his
throat
hard
and
said
there
there
it
all
right
girls
go
along
now
ragnhild
a
and
then
to
ragnhild
when
the
others
had
gone
what
was
i
going
to
say
now
you
have
moved
some
photos
have
you
that
were
on
the
piano
here
i
ca
make
out
what
happened
to
then
ragnhild
spoke
up
well
and
with
spirit
and
may
heaven
bless
her
for
the
lie
i
no
indeed
was
fruen
herself
one
oh
well
well
i
only
wondered
how
it
was
they
had
relieved
relieved
the
captain
was
to
hear
it
as
he
was
leaving
he
told
ragnhild
to
say
i
was
not
to
go
away
from
øvrebø
till
he
returned
xiv
no
i
did
go
away
i
worked
on
tramped
through
the
weariest
days
of
my
life
to
their
end
and
finished
laying
the
pipes
it
was
a
bit
of
a
change
for
us
all
on
the
place
the
first
time
we
could
draw
water
from
a
tap
and
we
were
none
the
worse
for
something
new
to
talk
about
for
a
while
lars
falkenberg
had
left
us
he
and
i
had
got
rid
of
all
disagreement
between
us
at
the
last
and
were
as
we
had
been
in
the
old
days
when
we
were
mates
and
tramped
the
roads
together
he
was
better
off
than
many
another
was
lars
light
of
heart
and
empty
of
head
and
thereto
unconscionably
sound
and
strong
true
there
would
be
no
more
singing
up
at
the
house
for
him
now
or
ever
after
but
he
seemed
to
have
grown
a
trifle
doubtful
of
his
voice
himself
the
last
few
years
and
contented
himself
now
for
the
most
part
with
the
things
he
had
sung
once
upon
a
time
at
dances
and
gentlefolk
parties
no
lars
falkenberg
was
none
so
badly
off
he
his
own
little
holding
with
keep
for
two
cows
and
a
pig
and
a
wife
and
children
he
had
as
well
but
what
were
grindhusen
and
i
to
turn
our
hands
to
now
i
could
go
off
wandering
anywhere
but
grindhusen
good
soul
was
no
wanderer
all
he
could
do
was
to
stay
on
at
one
place
and
work
till
he
was
dismissed
and
when
the
stern
decision
came
he
was
so
upset
that
he
could
not
take
it
easily
but
felt
he
was
being
specially
hardly
used
then
after
a
while
he
grew
confident
again
and
full
of
a
childlike
trust
not
in
himself
but
in
fate
in
providence
sat
down
resignedly
and
said
ay
well
be
all
right
let
hope
with
god
but
he
was
happy
enough
he
settled
down
with
marvellous
ease
at
whatever
place
he
came
to
and
could
stay
there
till
he
died
if
it
rested
with
himself
home
he
need
not
go
the
children
were
grown
up
now
and
his
wife
never
troubled
him
no
this
old
sinner
of
former
days
all
he
needed
now
was
a
place
and
work
where
are
you
going
after
this
he
asked
me
a
long
way
up
in
the
hills
to
trovatn
to
a
he
did
not
believe
me
in
the
least
but
he
answered
quickly
and
evasively
ay
i
dare
say
after
we
had
finished
the
pipes
nils
sent
grindhusen
and
myself
up
cutting
wood
till
the
captain
returned
we
cut
up
and
stacked
the
the
woodmen
had
left
neat
and
steady
work
it
was
we
be
turned
off
both
of
us
said
grindhusen
when
captain
comes
eh
you
might
get
work
here
for
the
winter
i
said
a
thousand
dozen
battens
means
a
lot
of
small
stuff
left
over
that
you
could
saw
up
for
a
reasonable
well
talk
to
the
captain
about
it
he
said
and
the
hope
of
regular
work
for
the
winter
made
this
man
a
contented
soul
he
could
manage
well
enough
no
grindhusen
had
nothing
much
to
trouble
about
but
then
there
was
myself
and
i
felt
but
little
worth
or
use
to
myself
now
heaven
help
me
that
sunday
i
wandered
restlessly
about
i
was
waiting
for
the
captain
he
was
to
be
back
today
to
make
sure
of
things
as
far
as
i
could
i
went
for
a
long
walk
up
along
the
stream
that
fed
our
reservoir
i
wanted
to
have
another
look
at
the
two
little
waters
up
the
hillside
the
sources
of
the
coming
down
on
the
way
back
i
met
lars
falkenberg
he
was
going
home
the
full
moon
was
just
coming
up
red
and
huge
and
turned
things
light
all
round
a
touch
of
snow
and
frost
there
was
too
it
was
easy
breathing
lars
was
in
a
friendly
mood
he
had
been
drinking
somewhere
and
talked
a
great
deal
but
i
was
not
altogether
pleased
at
meeting
him
i
had
stood
there
long
up
on
the
wooded
hillside
listening
to
the
soughing
of
earth
and
sky
and
there
was
nothing
else
to
hear
then
there
might
come
a
faint
little
rustling
a
curled
and
shrunken
leaf
rolling
and
rustling
down
over
the
frozen
branches
it
was
like
the
sound
of
a
little
spring
then
the
soughing
of
earth
and
sky
again
a
gentleness
came
over
me
a
mute
was
set
on
all
my
strings
lars
falkenberg
wanted
to
know
where
i
had
been
and
where
i
was
going
reservoir
a
senseless
business
that
reservoir
thing
as
if
people
could
carry
water
for
themselves
the
captain
went
in
too
much
for
these
inventions
and
ploughing
over
standing
crops
and
he
find
himself
landed
one
day
a
rich
harvest
they
said
ho
yes
but
they
never
troubled
to
think
what
it
must
cost
with
machines
for
this
and
that
and
a
pack
of
men
to
every
machine
again
what
must
it
have
cost
now
for
grindhusen
and
me
that
summer
and
then
himself
this
autumn
in
the
old
days
it
had
been
music
and
plenty
at
øvrebø
and
some
of
us
had
been
asked
into
the
parlour
to
sing
say
no
more
said
lars
and
now
there
hardly
a
sizeable
stick
of
timber
left
in
the
a
few
years
time
and
it
be
as
thick
as
a
few
years
a
many
years
you
mean
no
it
not
enough
to
go
about
being
captain
and
commanding
brrrr
and
there
it
is
and
he
not
even
spokesman
for
the
neighbours
now
and
you
never
see
folk
coming
up
now
to
ask
him
what
he
say
was
best
to
do
in
this
or
that
did
you
see
the
captain
down
below
had
he
come
back
yet
i
broke
in
he
just
come
back
looked
like
a
skeleton
he
did
what
was
i
going
to
say
when
are
you
leaving
tomorrow
i
said
so
soon
lars
was
all
friendliness
and
wishing
me
good
luck
now
he
had
not
thought
i
should
be
going
off
at
once
it
all
a
chance
if
i
see
you
again
this
time
he
said
but
tell
you
this
much
now
you
do
well
to
stop
frittering
your
life
away
any
more
and
never
staying
on
a
place
for
good
and
i
say
as
much
here
and
now
so
mark
my
words
i
dare
say
i
have
got
on
so
grandly
myself
but
i
do
know
many
of
our
likes
have
done
better
and
anyway
not
you
i
a
roof
over
my
head
at
the
least
and
a
wife
and
children
and
two
cows
one
bears
autumn
and
one
spring
and
then
a
pig
and
that
all
i
can
say
i
own
so
better
not
boast
about
that
but
if
you
reckon
it
up
it
amounts
to
a
bit
of
a
holding
after
it
all
very
well
for
you
the
way
you
got
on
said
lars
is
friendlier
than
ever
after
this
appreciation
he
wishes
me
no
end
of
good
and
goes
on
there
none
could
get
on
better
than
yourself
for
that
matter
with
the
knack
you
got
for
all
kinds
of
work
and
writing
and
figuring
into
the
bargain
but
it
your
own
fault
you
might
have
done
as
i
told
you
these
six
seven
years
ago
and
taken
one
of
the
other
girls
on
the
place
like
i
did
with
emma
and
settled
down
here
for
good
then
you
would
be
going
about
now
from
place
to
place
but
i
say
the
same
again
it
too
late
i
answered
ay
you
terribly
grey
i
do
know
who
you
could
reckon
to
get
now
about
here
how
old
are
you
now
do
ask
me
not
exactly
a
young
one
perhaps
but
still
what
was
i
going
to
say
come
up
with
me
a
little
and
maybe
i
i
walked
up
and
lars
went
on
talking
all
the
way
he
offered
to
put
in
a
word
for
me
with
the
captain
so
i
could
get
a
clearing
like
he
had
funny
to
go
and
forget
a
thing
like
that
he
said
it
gone
clean
out
of
my
head
but
come
up
home
now
i
be
sure
to
hit
on
it
all
friendliness
he
was
now
but
i
had
one
or
two
things
to
do
myself
and
would
not
go
farther
you
wo
see
the
captain
tonight
no
but
it
was
late
emma
would
be
in
bed
and
would
only
be
a
trouble
not
a
bit
of
it
said
lars
and
if
she
has
gone
to
bed
what
of
it
i
should
wonder
now
if
there
was
a
shirt
of
yours
up
there
too
better
come
up
and
take
it
with
you
and
save
emma
going
all
the
way
down
but
i
would
not
go
up
i
ventured
however
to
send
a
greeting
to
emma
this
time
ay
surely
said
lars
and
if
so
be
as
you
have
time
to
come
up
to
my
bit
of
a
place
now
why
there
it
is
you
be
going
off
first
thing
tomorrow
i
suppose
it
slipped
my
mind
for
the
moment
that
i
should
not
be
able
to
see
the
captain
that
evening
and
i
answered
now
that
i
should
be
leaving
as
early
as
could
be
well
then
i
send
emma
down
with
that
shirt
of
yours
at
once
said
lars
and
good
luck
to
you
and
do
forget
what
i
and
that
was
farewell
to
lars
a
little
farther
down
i
slackened
my
pace
after
all
there
was
no
real
hurry
about
the
few
things
i
had
to
pack
and
finish
off
i
turned
back
and
walked
up
again
a
little
whistling
in
the
moonlight
it
was
a
fine
evening
not
cold
at
all
only
a
soft
obedient
calm
all
over
the
woods
half
an
hour
passed
and
then
to
my
surprise
came
emma
bringing
my
shirt
next
morning
neither
grindhusen
nor
i
went
to
the
woods
grindhusen
was
uneasy
did
you
speak
to
the
captain
about
me
he
asked
i
have
spoken
to
oh
i
know
he
turn
me
off
now
you
see
if
he
had
any
sense
let
me
stay
on
to
cut
up
all
that
but
what
he
know
about
things
it
as
much
as
he
can
manage
to
keep
a
man
at
why
what
this
grindhusen
you
seemed
to
like
the
captain
well
enough
oh
yes
you
know
yes
of
course
he
good
enough
i
dare
say
h
i
wonder
now
if
the
inspector
down
on
the
river
might
have
some
little
scrap
of
a
job
in
my
line
he
a
man
with
plenty
of
money
is
the
i
saw
the
captain
at
eight
and
talked
with
him
a
while
then
a
couple
of
neighbours
came
to
call
offering
sympathy
in
his
bereavement
no
doubt
the
captain
looked
fatigued
but
he
was
not
a
broken
man
by
any
means
his
manner
was
firm
and
steady
enough
he
spoke
to
me
a
little
about
a
plan
he
had
in
mind
for
a
big
for
hay
and
corn
no
more
of
things
awry
now
øvrebø
no
more
emotion
no
soul
gone
off
the
rails
i
thought
of
it
almost
with
sadness
no
one
to
stick
up
impertinent
photographs
on
the
piano
but
no
one
to
play
on
that
piano
either
dumb
now
it
stands
since
the
last
note
sounded
no
for
fru
falkenberg
is
not
here
now
she
can
do
no
more
hurt
to
herself
or
any
other
nothing
of
all
that
used
to
be
here
now
remains
then
to
be
seen
if
all
will
be
flowers
and
joy
at
øvrebø
hereafter
if
only
he
does
take
to
drinking
again
i
said
to
nils
no
surely
he
said
and
i
do
believe
he
ever
did
it
was
just
a
bit
of
foolery
if
you
ask
me
his
going
on
like
that
just
for
the
time
but
talking
of
something
else
will
you
be
coming
back
here
in
the
spring
no
i
answered
i
shall
not
come
again
then
nils
and
i
took
leave
of
each
other
well
i
remember
that
calm
and
fairness
of
mind
i
stood
looking
after
him
as
he
walked
away
across
the
yard
then
he
turned
round
and
said
were
you
up
in
the
woods
yesterday
is
there
snow
enough
for
me
to
take
a
sledge
up
for
wood
yes
i
answered
and
he
went
off
relieved
to
the
stables
to
harness
up
grindhusen
too
comes
along
on
the
way
to
the
stable
he
stops
for
a
moment
to
tell
me
that
the
captain
has
himself
offered
him
work
cutting
wood
up
all
the
small
stuff
you
can
he
said
at
it
for
a
while
i
dare
say
we
can
agree
all
right
about
wages
and
thank
you
captain
says
i
go
and
tell
nils
he
says
oh
but
he
a
grand
sort
is
the
captain
there
not
many
of
his
like
a
little
while
after
i
was
sent
for
up
to
the
captain
room
he
thanked
me
for
the
work
i
had
done
both
indoors
and
out
and
went
on
to
settle
up
and
that
was
all
really
but
he
kept
me
there
a
little
asking
one
or
two
things
about
the
and
we
talked
over
that
for
a
bit
anyhow
it
would
have
to
wait
till
after
christmas
he
said
but
when
the
time
came
he
be
glad
to
see
me
back
he
looked
me
in
the
face
then
and
went
on
but
you
wo
come
back
here
again
now
i
suppose
i
was
taken
by
surprise
but
i
faced
him
squarely
in
return
and
answered
as
i
went
down
i
thought
over
what
he
had
said
had
he
seen
through
me
then
if
so
he
had
shown
a
degree
of
trust
in
me
that
i
was
glad
to
think
of
at
least
he
was
a
man
of
good
feeling
trust
me
and
why
should
he
not
played
out
and
done
with
as
i
was
suffered
to
go
about
and
do
and
be
as
i
pleased
by
virtue
of
my
eminent
incapacity
for
harm
yes
that
was
it
and
anyhow
there
was
nothing
to
see
through
after
all
i
went
round
upstairs
and
down
saying
to
them
all
to
ragnhild
and
the
maids
then
as
i
was
coming
in
front
of
the
house
with
my
pack
on
my
shoulder
the
captain
called
to
me
from
the
steps
wait
i
just
thought
if
you
going
to
the
station
the
lad
could
drive
you
thoughtful
and
considerate
again
but
i
thanked
him
and
declined
i
was
not
so
played
out
but
that
i
could
surely
walk
that
way
back
in
my
little
town
again
and
if
i
have
come
here
now
it
is
because
the
place
lies
on
my
way
to
trovatn
up
in
the
hills
all
is
as
it
was
before
here
now
save
for
thin
ice
on
the
river
above
and
below
the
rapids
and
snow
on
the
ice
again
i
take
care
to
buy
clothes
and
equipment
here
in
the
town
and
having
got
a
good
new
pair
of
shoes
i
take
my
old
ones
to
the
cobbler
to
be
the
cobbler
is
inclined
to
talk
and
begs
me
to
sit
down
and
where
this
man
from
now
he
asks
in
a
moment
i
am
enveloped
by
the
spirit
of
the
town
i
walk
up
to
the
churchyard
here
too
care
has
been
taken
to
provide
equipment
for
the
winter
bundles
of
straw
have
been
fastened
round
plants
and
bushes
many
a
delicate
monument
is
protected
by
a
tall
wooden
hood
and
the
hoods
again
armoured
with
a
coat
of
paint
as
if
some
provident
soul
had
thought
well
now
i
have
this
funeral
monument
here
with
proper
care
it
may
be
made
to
last
for
generations
there
is
a
christmas
fair
on
too
and
i
stroll
along
to
see
here
are
skis
and
toboggans
butter
scoops
and
log
chairs
from
the
underworld
mittens
clothes
rollers
foxes
skins
and
here
are
and
drovers
mingling
with
drunken
folk
from
up
the
valley
jews
there
are
too
anxious
to
palm
off
a
gaudy
watch
or
so
for
all
there
is
no
money
in
the
town
and
the
watches
come
from
that
country
up
in
the
alps
where
bocklin
did
not
come
from
where
nothing
and
nobody
ever
came
from
but
in
the
evening
there
is
brave
entertainment
for
all
two
there
are
and
the
music
is
supplied
by
masters
on
the
and
wonderful
music
it
is
to
be
sure
there
are
iron
strings
to
it
and
it
utters
no
empty
phrases
but
music
with
a
sting
in
its
tail
it
acts
differently
upon
different
people
some
find
it
rich
in
national
sweetness
some
of
us
are
rather
constrained
to
grit
our
teeth
and
howl
in
melancholy
wise
never
was
stinging
music
delivered
with
more
effect
the
dance
goes
on
in
one
of
the
intervals
the
schoolmaster
sings
touching
verses
about
an
aged
mother
worn
with
toil
and
sweating
as
blood
but
some
of
the
wild
youths
insist
on
dancing
and
nothing
else
this
start
singing
when
they
standing
here
with
the
girls
all
ready
to
dance
it
not
proper
the
singer
stops
and
meets
the
protest
in
broadest
dialect
what
not
proper
why
it
by
vinje
himself
heated
discussion
and
arguing
and
shouting
never
were
verses
sung
with
more
effect
the
dance
goes
on
the
girls
from
the
valley
are
armoured
five
layers
thick
but
who
cares
for
that
all
are
used
to
hard
work
and
the
dance
goes
on
ay
the
thunder
goes
on
helps
things
bravely
along
the
cauldron
is
fairly
steaming
now
at
three
in
the
morning
the
local
police
force
appears
and
knocks
on
the
floor
with
his
stick
the
dancers
go
off
in
the
moonlight
and
spread
out
near
and
far
and
nine
months
later
the
girls
from
the
valley
show
proof
that
after
all
they
were
one
layer
of
armour
short
never
was
such
an
effect
of
being
one
layer
short
the
river
is
quieter
now
not
much
of
a
river
to
look
at
the
winter
is
come
upon
it
now
it
drives
the
mills
and
works
that
stand
on
its
banks
for
in
spite
of
all
it
is
and
will
be
a
great
river
still
but
it
shows
no
life
it
has
shut
down
the
lid
on
itself
and
the
rapids
have
suffered
too
and
i
who
stood
watching
them
once
and
listening
and
thought
to
myself
if
one
lived
down
there
in
the
roar
of
it
for
ever
what
would
one
brain
be
like
at
last
but
now
the
rapids
are
dwindled
and
murmur
faintly
it
would
be
shame
to
call
it
a
roar
is
no
more
than
a
ruin
of
what
it
was
sunk
into
poverty
great
rocks
thrust
up
all
down
the
channel
with
here
and
there
a
stick
of
timber
hung
up
thwart
and
slantwise
one
could
cross
by
way
of
stick
and
stone
i
have
done
all
i
have
to
do
in
the
town
and
my
pack
is
on
my
shoulders
it
is
sunday
and
a
fine
clear
day
i
look
in
at
the
hotel
to
see
the
porter
he
is
going
with
me
a
bit
of
the
way
up
the
river
the
great
fellow
offers
to
carry
my
things
as
if
i
could
not
carry
them
myself
we
go
up
along
the
right
bank
but
the
road
itself
lies
on
the
left
the
way
we
are
taking
is
only
a
summer
path
trodden
only
by
the
lumbermen
and
with
some
few
fresh
tracks
in
the
snow
my
companion
can
not
make
out
why
we
do
not
follow
the
road
he
was
always
dull
of
wit
but
i
have
been
up
this
path
twice
before
these
last
few
days
and
i
am
going
up
it
once
again
it
is
my
own
tracks
we
can
see
all
the
time
i
question
him
that
lady
you
told
me
about
once
the
one
that
was
drowned
was
it
somewhere
about
here
eh
oh
the
one
that
fell
in
yes
ay
it
was
close
by
here
dreadful
it
was
there
must
have
been
twenty
of
us
here
with
the
police
searching
dragging
the
channel
yes
we
got
out
planks
and
ladders
but
they
broke
through
under
us
we
cut
up
all
the
ice
in
the
end
here
he
stopped
suddenly
you
can
see
the
way
we
i
can
see
in
the
dark
space
where
the
boats
had
moved
out
and
broken
through
the
ice
to
drag
the
depth
it
was
frozen
over
again
now
the
porter
goes
on
we
found
her
at
last
and
a
mercy
it
was
i
dare
say
the
river
was
low
as
it
was
gone
right
down
at
once
she
had
and
got
stuck
fast
between
two
stones
there
was
no
current
to
speak
of
if
it
had
been
spring
now
she
have
travelled
a
long
way
trying
to
cross
to
the
other
side
i
suppose
ay
they
always
getting
out
on
the
ice
as
soon
as
it
comes
a
nasty
way
it
is
somebody
had
been
over
already
but
that
was
two
days
before
she
just
came
walking
down
on
this
side
where
we
are
and
the
engineer
he
was
coming
down
the
road
on
the
other
side
he
been
out
on
his
bicycle
somewhere
then
they
caught
sight
of
each
other
and
waved
or
made
a
sign
or
something
for
they
were
cousins
or
something
both
of
them
then
the
lady
must
have
mistaken
him
somehow
the
engineer
says
and
thought
he
was
beckoning
for
she
started
to
come
across
he
shouted
at
her
not
to
but
she
did
hear
and
he
got
his
bicycle
and
could
move
but
anyhow
some
one
had
got
across
before
the
engineer
told
the
police
all
about
how
it
happened
and
it
was
written
down
every
word
well
and
then
when
she
across
she
goes
down
a
rotten
piece
of
ice
it
must
have
been
where
she
trod
and
the
engineer
he
comes
down
like
lightning
on
his
bicycle
through
the
town
and
up
to
the
hotel
and
starts
ringing
i
never
heard
the
like
the
way
he
rang
someone
in
the
river
he
cries
out
cousin
fallen
in
out
we
went
and
he
came
along
with
us
we
ropes
and
but
that
was
no
use
the
police
came
soon
after
and
the
fire
brigade
they
got
hold
of
a
boat
up
there
and
carried
it
between
them
till
they
got
to
us
then
they
got
it
out
and
started
searching
about
with
the
drag
we
did
find
her
the
first
day
but
the
day
after
ay
a
nasty
business
that
it
and
her
husband
came
you
said
the
captain
yes
the
captain
he
came
and
you
can
reckon
for
yourself
the
state
he
was
in
and
we
were
all
the
same
for
that
matter
all
the
town
was
the
engineer
he
was
out
of
his
senses
for
a
long
while
so
they
told
us
at
the
hotel
and
when
the
captain
arrived
the
engineer
went
off
inspecting
up
the
river
just
because
he
could
bear
to
talk
any
more
about
so
the
captain
did
see
him
then
no
h
nay
i
do
know
said
the
porter
looking
around
no
i
do
know
anything
about
that
his
answer
was
so
confused
it
was
evident
that
he
did
know
but
it
was
of
no
importance
and
i
did
not
question
him
again
well
thanks
for
coming
up
with
me
i
said
and
shared
a
little
money
with
him
for
a
winter
wrap
or
something
of
the
sort
and
i
took
leave
of
him
and
wanted
him
to
turn
back
he
seemed
anxious
however
to
go
on
with
me
a
little
farther
and
to
get
me
to
agree
he
suddenly
confesses
that
the
captain
had
seen
the
engineer
while
he
was
here
yes
the
porter
good
foolish
creature
had
understood
enough
of
the
maids
gossip
in
the
kitchen
to
make
out
that
there
was
something
wrong
about
the
engineer
and
this
cousin
of
his
who
had
come
to
stay
more
than
this
however
he
had
not
seen
but
as
regards
the
meeting
between
the
two
men
it
was
he
himself
who
had
acted
as
guide
to
the
captain
on
his
way
up
to
find
the
engineer
he
said
he
must
find
him
and
so
we
went
up
together
and
the
captain
he
asked
me
on
the
way
what
could
there
be
to
inspect
up
the
river
now
it
was
frozen
over
and
i
could
see
myself
i
told
him
and
so
we
walked
up
all
day
to
about
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
might
see
if
he
not
in
the
hut
here
i
said
for
i
heard
the
lumbermen
used
the
place
then
the
captain
would
let
me
go
on
with
him
any
farther
but
told
me
to
wait
and
he
walked
up
to
the
hut
by
himself
and
went
in
he
not
been
in
the
place
more
than
a
bare
couple
of
minutes
when
out
he
comes
and
the
engineer
with
him
there
was
a
word
or
so
between
them
i
did
hear
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
captain
flings
up
one
arm
like
that
and
lands
out
at
the
engineer
and
down
he
goes
lord
but
he
must
have
felt
it
pretty
badly
and
not
content
with
that
he
picks
him
up
and
lands
out
at
him
again
as
hard
as
before
then
he
came
back
to
me
and
said
we
be
going
i
grew
thoughtful
at
this
it
seemed
strange
that
this
porter
a
creature
who
bore
no
grudge
or
to
any
one
should
leave
the
engineer
up
there
at
the
hut
without
aid
and
he
had
shown
no
disapproval
in
his
telling
of
the
thrashing
the
engineer
must
have
been
miserly
with
him
too
i
thought
and
never
paid
him
for
his
services
but
only
ordered
him
about
and
laughed
at
him
puppy
that
he
was
that
would
be
it
no
doubt
and
this
time
perhaps
i
was
not
misled
by
jealous
feelings
of
my
own
but
the
captain
he
was
free
with
his
money
if
you
like
said
the
porter
at
last
i
paid
off
all
my
owings
with
what
he
gave
me
ay
indeed
i
when
at
last
i
had
got
rid
of
the
man
i
crossed
the
river
the
ice
was
firm
enough
i
was
on
the
main
road
now
and
i
walked
on
thinking
over
the
porter
story
that
scene
at
the
hut
what
did
it
amount
to
after
all
it
merely
showed
that
one
of
the
two
men
was
big
and
strong
the
other
a
little
sportsman
heavily
built
behind
but
the
captain
was
an
officer
it
was
something
of
that
sort
perhaps
he
had
been
thinking
perhaps
he
ought
to
have
thought
a
little
more
in
other
ways
while
there
was
yet
time
who
can
say
it
was
his
wife
who
had
been
drowned
the
captain
might
do
what
he
pleased
now
she
would
never
come
again
but
if
she
did
what
then
she
was
born
to
her
fate
no
doubt
husband
and
wife
had
tried
to
patch
up
the
damage
but
had
failed
i
remember
her
as
she
was
six
or
seven
years
back
she
found
life
dull
and
fell
in
love
a
trifle
here
and
there
perhaps
even
then
but
she
was
faithful
and
and
time
went
on
she
had
no
occupation
but
had
three
to
her
house
she
had
no
children
but
she
had
a
piano
but
she
had
no
children
and
life
can
afford
to
waste
mother
and
child
it
was
that
went
down
epilogue
a
wanderer
plays
with
muted
strings
when
he
comes
to
fifty
years
then
he
plays
with
muted
strings
or
i
might
put
it
in
this
way
if
he
comes
too
late
for
the
harvest
of
berries
in
autumn
why
he
is
come
too
late
that
is
all
and
if
one
fine
day
he
finds
he
can
no
longer
be
gay
and
laugh
all
over
his
face
in
delight
of
life
is
because
he
is
old
no
doubt
blame
him
not
for
that
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
requires
a
certain
vacuity
of
mind
to
go
about
feeling
permanently
contented
with
oneself
and
all
else
but
we
have
all
our
softer
moments
a
prisoner
is
being
driven
to
the
scaffold
in
a
cart
a
nail
in
the
seat
irks
him
he
shifts
aside
a
little
and
feels
more
at
ease
a
captain
should
not
pray
that
god
may
forgive
him
as
he
forgives
his
god
it
is
simply
theatrical
a
wanderer
who
can
not
reckon
every
day
on
food
and
drink
clothes
and
boots
and
house
and
home
feels
just
the
right
degree
of
privation
when
all
these
luxuries
are
lacking
if
you
can
not
manage
one
way
why
there
will
be
another
but
if
the
other
way
should
also
fail
then
one
does
not
forgive
one
god
but
takes
up
the
responsibility
oneself
shoulder
against
what
comes
that
is
bow
to
it
a
trifle
hard
for
flesh
and
blood
and
it
greys
a
man
hair
sadly
but
a
wanderer
thanks
god
for
life
it
was
good
to
live
i
might
put
it
that
way
for
why
these
high
demands
on
life
what
have
we
earned
all
the
boxes
of
sweetmeats
a
could
wish
for
well
and
good
but
have
we
not
had
the
world
to
look
upon
each
day
and
the
soughing
of
the
woods
to
hear
there
is
nothing
so
grand
in
all
the
world
as
that
voice
of
the
woods
there
was
a
scent
of
jasmine
in
a
shrubbery
and
one
i
know
thrilled
with
joy
not
for
the
jasmine
scent
but
for
all
there
was
for
the
light
in
a
window
a
memory
the
whole
of
life
he
was
called
away
from
the
jasmines
after
but
he
had
been
paid
beforehand
for
that
little
mishap
and
so
it
is
the
mere
grace
that
we
are
given
life
at
all
is
generous
payment
in
advance
for
all
the
miseries
of
life
for
every
one
of
them
no
do
not
think
we
have
the
right
to
more
sweetmeats
than
we
get
a
wanderer
advice
no
superstition
what
is
life
all
but
what
is
yours
is
fame
oh
tell
us
why
a
man
should
not
so
insist
on
what
is
it
is
comical
a
wanderer
laughs
at
any
one
who
can
be
so
comical
i
remember
one
who
could
not
give
up
that
he
started
to
lay
a
fire
in
his
stove
at
noon
and
by
evening
he
got
it
to
burn
at
last
he
could
leave
the
comfortable
warmth
to
go
to
bed
but
sat
there
till
other
people
got
up
lest
it
should
be
wasted
a
norwegian
writer
of
stage
plays
it
was
i
have
wandered
about
a
good
deal
in
my
time
and
am
grown
foolish
now
and
out
of
bloom
but
i
do
not
hold
the
perverse
belief
of
old
men
generally
that
i
am
wiser
than
i
was
and
i
hope
i
may
never
grow
wise
a
sign
of
decrepitude
if
i
thank
god
for
life
it
is
not
by
virtue
of
any
riper
wisdom
that
has
come
to
me
with
age
but
because
i
have
always
taken
a
pleasure
in
life
age
gives
no
riper
wisdom
age
gives
nothing
but
age
i
was
too
late
for
the
berries
this
year
but
i
am
going
up
that
way
all
the
same
i
am
allowing
myself
this
little
treat
by
way
of
reward
for
having
worked
well
this
summer
and
i
reach
my
goal
on
the
of
december
it
is
true
no
doubt
that
i
might
have
stayed
down
among
the
villages
i
could
have
managed
somehow
no
doubt
as
did
all
the
others
who
had
found
it
time
to
settle
down
and
lars
falkenberg
my
colleague
and
mate
he
had
urged
me
to
take
up
a
holding
with
keep
for
a
wife
and
two
cows
and
a
pig
a
friend
advice
and
then
why
one
of
the
cows
might
be
an
ox
to
ride
a
means
of
transport
for
my
shivering
age
but
it
came
to
naught
it
came
to
naught
my
wisdom
has
not
come
with
age
here
am
i
going
up
to
trovatn
and
the
waste
lands
to
live
in
a
wooden
hut
what
pleasure
can
there
be
in
that
lars
falkenberg
and
every
one
else
have
no
fear
i
have
a
man
to
come
up
with
things
i
need
so
i
drift
about
and
about
by
myself
looking
after
myself
living
alone
i
miss
that
seal
of
bishop
pavel
one
of
his
descendants
gave
it
to
me
and
i
had
it
in
my
waistcoat
pocket
this
summer
but
looking
for
it
now
i
find
i
have
lost
it
well
well
but
anyhow
i
have
been
paid
in
advance
for
that
mishap
in
having
owned
it
once
but
i
do
not
feel
the
want
of
books
to
read
the
of
december
i
can
keep
a
date
in
mind
and
carelessly
forget
things
more
important
it
is
only
just
now
i
remember
about
the
books
that
captain
falkenberg
and
his
wife
had
many
books
in
their
house
novels
and
plays
a
whole
bookcase
full
i
saw
it
one
day
when
i
was
painting
windows
and
doors
at
øvrebø
entire
sets
of
authors
they
had
and
authors
complete
works
thirty
books
why
the
complete
works
i
do
not
know
books
one
two
three
ten
thirty
they
had
come
out
each
christmas
novels
thirty
volumes
the
same
novel
they
read
them
no
doubt
the
captain
and
his
wife
knew
every
time
what
they
should
find
in
the
poets
of
the
home
there
was
always
such
a
lot
about
all
coming
right
in
the
end
so
they
read
them
no
doubt
how
should
i
know
heavens
what
a
host
of
books
two
men
could
not
shift
the
bookcase
when
i
wanted
to
paint
behind
it
took
three
men
and
a
cook
to
move
it
one
of
the
men
was
grindhusen
he
flushed
under
the
weight
of
those
poets
of
the
home
and
said
i
ca
see
what
folk
want
with
such
a
mighty
crowd
of
books
grindhusen
as
if
he
knew
anything
about
it
the
captain
and
his
wife
had
all
those
books
no
doubt
that
none
should
be
lacking
there
they
were
all
complete
it
would
make
a
gap
to
take
away
a
single
one
they
were
paired
each
with
the
rest
uniform
poetry
the
same
story
throughout
an
has
been
up
here
with
me
in
the
hut
nothing
much
and
his
dog
was
an
brute
i
was
glad
when
he
went
on
again
he
took
down
my
copper
saucepan
from
the
wall
and
used
it
for
his
cooking
and
left
it
black
with
soot
it
is
not
my
copper
saucepan
but
was
here
in
the
hut
left
by
some
one
who
was
here
before
i
only
rubbed
it
with
ashes
and
hung
it
up
on
the
wall
as
a
for
myself
i
am
rubbing
it
up
again
now
for
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
it
turns
dim
unfailingly
when
there
is
rain
or
snow
coming
on
if
ragnhild
had
been
here
now
she
would
have
polished
up
that
saucepan
herself
but
then
again
i
tell
myself
i
would
rather
see
to
my
own
ragnhild
can
find
something
else
to
do
and
if
this
place
up
in
the
woods
were
our
clearing
then
she
would
have
the
children
and
the
cows
and
the
pig
but
copper
things
i
prefer
to
do
myself
ragnhild
i
remember
a
lady
the
mistress
of
a
house
she
did
no
work
at
all
and
saw
to
nothing
least
of
all
to
herself
and
ill
she
fared
in
the
end
but
six
or
seven
years
back
i
had
never
believed
any
one
could
be
so
delicate
and
lovely
to
another
as
she
i
drove
her
once
upon
a
journey
and
she
was
shy
with
me
although
she
was
a
lady
and
above
me
she
blushed
and
looked
down
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
she
made
me
feel
a
kind
of
shyness
myself
although
i
was
only
her
servant
only
by
looking
at
me
with
her
two
eyes
when
she
spoke
to
me
she
showed
me
treasures
and
beauty
beyond
what
i
knew
before
i
remember
it
still
ay
here
i
sit
remembering
it
yet
and
i
shake
my
head
and
say
to
myself
how
strange
it
was
how
strange
and
then
she
died
and
what
more
nothing
more
i
am
still
here
but
she
is
gone
but
i
should
not
grieve
at
her
death
i
had
been
paid
beforehand
surely
for
that
loss
in
that
she
looked
at
me
with
her
two
eyes
a
thing
beyond
my
deserts
ay
so
it
must
be
woman
what
do
the
sages
know
of
woman
i
know
a
sage
and
he
wrote
of
woman
wrote
of
woman
in
thirty
volumes
of
uniform
i
counted
the
volumes
once
in
a
big
bookcase
and
at
last
he
wrote
of
the
woman
who
left
her
own
children
to
go
in
search
of
the
wonderful
but
what
then
were
the
children
oh
it
was
comical
a
wanderer
laughs
at
anything
so
comical
what
does
the
sage
know
of
woman
to
begin
with
he
was
not
a
sage
at
all
till
he
grew
old
and
all
he
knew
of
woman
then
was
from
memory
but
then
again
he
can
have
no
memory
of
her
seeing
he
never
knew
her
the
man
who
has
an
aptitude
for
wisdom
busies
himself
jealously
with
his
little
aptitude
and
nothing
else
cultivates
and
cherishes
it
holds
it
forth
and
lives
for
it
we
do
not
turn
to
woman
for
wisdom
the
four
wisest
heads
in
the
world
who
have
delivered
their
findings
on
the
subject
of
woman
simply
sat
and
invented
her
out
of
their
own
heads
octogenarians
young
or
old
they
were
that
rode
on
oxen
they
knew
nothing
of
woman
in
holiness
woman
in
sweetness
woman
as
an
indispensable
but
they
wrote
and
wrote
about
her
think
of
it
without
finding
her
heaven
save
me
from
growing
wise
and
i
will
mumble
the
same
to
my
last
turn
heaven
save
me
from
growing
wise
just
cold
enough
now
for
a
little
outing
i
have
had
in
mind
the
lie
rosy
in
the
sun
and
my
copper
saucepan
points
to
fair
it
is
eight
in
the
morning
knapsack
and
a
good
stock
of
food
an
extra
lashing
in
my
pocket
in
case
anything
should
break
and
a
note
on
the
table
for
the
man
with
supplies
in
case
he
should
come
up
while
i
am
away
oh
but
i
have
been
showing
off
nicely
all
to
myself
pretending
i
was
going
far
and
needed
to
equip
myself
with
care
had
occasion
for
all
my
presence
of
mind
and
endurance
a
man
can
show
off
like
that
when
he
is
going
far
but
i
am
not
i
have
no
errand
anywhere
and
nothing
calls
me
i
am
only
a
wanderer
setting
forth
from
a
hut
and
coming
back
to
it
again
it
does
not
matter
where
i
am
it
is
quiet
and
empty
in
the
woods
all
things
deep
in
snow
holding
their
breath
as
i
come
at
noon
looking
back
from
a
hill
i
can
see
trovatn
far
behind
white
and
flat
it
lies
a
stretch
of
chalk
a
desert
of
snow
after
a
meal
i
go
on
again
higher
and
higher
nearing
the
fjeld
now
but
slowly
and
thoughtfully
with
hands
in
my
pockets
there
is
no
hurry
i
have
only
to
find
a
shelter
for
the
night
later
on
in
the
afternoon
i
sit
down
again
to
eat
as
if
i
needed
a
meal
and
had
earned
it
but
it
is
only
for
something
to
do
my
hands
are
idle
and
my
brain
inclined
to
fancies
it
gets
dark
early
well
to
find
a
sheltered
cleft
in
the
hillside
here
there
are
fallen
firs
enough
lying
about
for
a
fire
such
are
the
things
i
tell
of
now
playing
with
muted
strings
i
was
out
early
next
morning
as
soon
as
it
began
to
get
light
a
quiet
warm
snowfall
came
on
and
there
was
a
soughing
in
the
air
bad
weather
coming
i
thought
to
myself
but
who
could
have
foreseen
it
neither
i
nor
my
looked
for
it
hours
ago
i
left
my
shelter
and
went
on
again
over
moor
and
heath
full
day
again
now
and
snowing
it
was
not
the
best
of
shelters
i
had
found
for
the
night
passably
soft
and
dry
with
branches
of
fir
to
lie
on
and
i
had
not
felt
the
cold
but
the
smoke
from
my
fire
drifted
in
over
me
and
troubled
my
breathing
but
now
this
afternoon
i
found
a
better
place
a
spacious
and
elegant
cave
with
walls
and
roof
complete
room
here
for
me
and
my
fire
and
the
smoke
went
up
i
nodded
at
this
and
decided
to
settle
down
here
though
it
was
early
yet
and
still
quite
light
i
could
distinctly
make
out
the
hills
and
valleys
and
rocks
on
a
naked
fjeld
straight
ahead
some
few
hours
march
away
but
i
nodded
as
if
i
had
reached
my
goal
and
set
to
work
gathering
firewood
and
bedding
for
the
night
i
felt
so
thoroughly
at
home
here
it
was
not
for
nothing
i
nodded
and
took
off
my
knapsack
was
this
the
place
you
were
making
for
i
say
talking
to
myself
in
jest
yes
i
answer
the
soughing
in
the
air
grew
stronger
it
was
not
snow
that
was
falling
now
but
rain
strange
a
great
wet
rainfall
down
over
the
cave
over
all
the
trees
outside
and
yet
it
was
the
cold
christmas
month
december
a
had
taken
it
into
its
head
to
visit
us
it
rained
and
rained
that
night
and
there
was
a
soughing
all
through
the
trees
outside
it
was
like
spring
it
filled
my
sleep
at
last
with
so
rich
an
ease
that
i
slept
on
sound
and
deep
till
it
was
broad
day
ten
the
rain
had
ceased
but
it
is
still
warm
i
sit
looking
out
of
the
cave
and
listening
to
the
bend
and
whisper
of
the
trees
then
a
stone
breaks
loose
on
the
fjeld
opposite
it
butts
against
a
rock
and
brings
that
down
as
well
a
few
faint
thuds
are
heard
then
a
rumble
i
see
what
is
happening
and
the
sound
echoes
within
me
the
rock
loosened
other
rocks
an
avalanche
goes
thundering
down
the
snow
and
earth
and
boulders
leaving
a
smoky
cloud
in
its
wake
the
stream
of
rubble
seems
in
a
living
rage
it
thrusts
its
way
on
tearing
down
other
masses
with
it
crowding
pouring
pouring
fills
up
a
chasm
in
the
valley
and
stops
the
last
few
boulders
settle
slowly
into
place
and
then
no
more
the
thunder
over
there
is
silence
and
within
myself
is
only
a
breathing
as
of
a
slowly
descending
bass
and
so
i
sit
once
more
listening
to
the
soughing
of
the
woods
is
it
the
heaving
of
the
aegean
sea
or
is
it
the
ocean
current
glimma
i
grow
weak
from
just
listening
recollections
of
my
past
life
rise
within
me
joys
by
the
thousand
music
and
eyes
flowers
there
is
nothing
more
glorious
than
the
soughing
of
the
woods
it
is
like
swinging
rocking
a
madness
uganda
antananarivo
honolulu
atacama
venezuela
but
it
is
all
the
years
no
doubt
that
make
me
so
weak
and
my
nerves
that
join
in
the
sounds
i
hear
i
get
up
and
stand
by
the
fire
to
get
over
it
now
i
think
of
it
i
feel
i
could
talk
to
the
fire
a
little
make
a
speech
to
the
dying
fire
i
am
in
a
house
here
and
the
acoustic
conditions
are
good
h
then
the
cave
is
darkened
it
is
the
again
with
his
dog
it
begins
to
freeze
as
i
trudge
along
homeward
to
my
hut
the
frost
soon
hardens
the
ground
moor
and
heath
making
it
easy
walking
i
trudge
along
slowly
and
carelessly
hands
in
my
pockets
there
is
no
hurry
now
it
matters
little
where
i
am
