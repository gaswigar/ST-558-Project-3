preface
the
object
of
this
book
is
more
modest
i
fear
than
that
of
much
which
has
appeared
upon
that
vital
political
matter
the
relation
between
the
jews
and
the
nations
around
them
it
does
not
propose
any
detailed
still
less
any
positive
legal
solution
to
what
has
become
a
pressing
problem
nor
does
it
pretend
to
any
complete
solution
of
it
it
is
no
more
than
a
suggestion
that
any
attempt
to
solve
this
problem
ought
to
follow
certain
general
lines
which
are
essentially
different
from
those
attempted
in
western
europe
during
the
time
immediately
preceding
our
own
i
suggest
that
if
the
present
generation
in
both
parties
to
the
discussion
the
jews
and
ourselves
will
drop
convention
and
make
a
principle
of
discussing
the
problem
in
terms
of
reality
we
shall
automatically
approach
a
right
solution
we
have
but
to
tell
the
truth
in
the
place
of
the
falsehoods
of
the
last
generation
therefore
of
the
three
principles
upon
which
this
essay
reposes
the
principle
that
must
come
to
an
end
seems
to
me
more
important
than
the
principle
of
mutual
recognition
or
even
the
principle
of
mutual
respect
for
it
may
well
be
that
my
judgment
is
at
fault
in
the
matter
of
jewish
national
consciousness
it
may
well
be
that
i
exaggerate
it
and
it
is
certain
that
one
party
to
a
debate
can
not
be
possessed
of
the
full
knowledge
required
for
its
settlement
the
other
side
must
be
heard
but
neither
my
judgment
nor
the
judgment
of
any
man
can
be
at
fault
on
the
value
of
truth
and
the
ultimate
evil
consequences
of
trying
to
build
upon
a
lie
the
english
reader
less
i
think
the
american
will
often
find
in
my
sentences
a
note
that
will
seem
to
him
fantastic
the
quarrel
is
already
acute
here
in
london
but
it
has
not
here
approached
the
limits
which
it
has
reached
long
ago
elsewhere
and
a
man
accustomed
to
the
quieter
air
in
which
all
public
affairs
have
until
recently
been
debated
in
this
country
may
smile
at
what
will
seem
to
him
odd
and
exaggerated
fears
to
this
i
would
reply
that
the
book
has
been
written
not
only
in
the
light
of
english
but
of
a
general
experience
i
will
bargain
that
were
it
put
into
the
hands
of
a
jury
chosen
from
the
various
nationalities
of
europe
and
the
united
states
it
would
be
found
too
moderate
in
its
estimate
of
the
peril
it
postulates
i
would
further
ask
the
reader
who
may
not
have
appreciated
how
rapidly
the
peril
approaches
to
consider
the
distance
traversed
in
the
last
few
years
it
is
not
very
long
since
a
mere
discussion
of
the
jewish
question
in
england
was
impossible
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
the
mere
admission
of
it
appeared
abnormal
the
truth
is
that
this
question
is
not
one
which
we
open
or
close
at
will
in
any
european
nation
it
is
imposed
successively
upon
one
nation
after
another
by
the
force
of
things
it
is
this
force
of
things
this
necessity
for
national
and
for
the
warding
off
of
disorder
which
has
thrust
the
jewish
question
upon
a
society
still
reluctant
to
consider
it
and
still
hoping
it
may
return
to
its
old
neglect
it
can
not
so
return
i
will
conclude
by
asking
my
jewish
as
well
as
my
readers
to
observe
that
i
have
left
out
every
personal
allusion
and
every
element
of
mere
recrimination
i
have
carefully
avoided
the
mention
of
particular
examples
in
public
life
of
the
friction
between
the
jews
and
ourselves
and
even
examples
drawn
from
past
history
with
these
i
could
often
have
strengthened
my
argument
and
i
would
certainly
have
made
my
book
a
great
deal
more
readable
i
have
left
out
everything
of
the
kind
because
though
one
can
always
rouse
interest
in
this
way
it
excites
enmity
between
the
opposing
parties
since
my
object
is
to
reduce
that
enmity
which
has
already
become
dangerous
i
should
be
insincere
indeed
if
from
mere
purpose
of
enlivening
this
essay
i
had
stooped
to
exasperate
feeling
i
could
have
made
the
book
far
stronger
as
a
piece
of
polemic
and
indefinitely
more
amusing
as
a
piece
of
record
but
i
have
not
written
it
as
a
piece
of
polemic
or
as
a
piece
of
record
i
have
written
it
as
an
attempt
at
justice

chapter
i
the
thesis
of
this
book
the
jews
are
an
alien
body
within
the
society
they
inhabit
hence
irritation
and
friction
a
problem
is
presented
by
the
strains
thus
set
up
the
solution
of
that
problem
is
urgently
necessary
an
alien
body
in
any
organism
is
disposed
of
in
one
of
two
ways
elimination
and
segregation
elimination
may
be
by
destruction
by
excretion
or
by
absorption
in
the
case
of
the
jews
the
first
is
abominable
and
further
has
failed
the
second
means
exile
it
has
also
failed
the
third
absorption
the
most
probable
and
most
moral
has
failed
throughout
the
past
though
having
everything
in
its
favour
there
remains
segregation
which
may
be
of
two
forms
hostile
to
or
careless
of
the
alien
body
or
friendly
to
it
and
careful
of
its
good
in
this
latter
form
it
may
best
be
called
the
first
kind
of
segregation
has
often
been
attempted
in
history
it
has
been
partially
successful
over
long
periods
but
has
always
left
behind
it
a
sense
of
injustice
and
has
not
really
solved
the
problem
also
it
has
always
failed
in
the
end
the
true
solution
is
in
the
second
kind
of
segregation
that
is
recognition
on
both
sides
of
a
separate
jewish
nationality
chapter
ii
the
denial
of
the
problem
in
the
immediate
past
the
problem
was
shirked
in
western
europe
by
a
mere
denial
of
its
existence
some
were
honestly
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
a
jewish
nation
some
thought
the
difference
one
of
religion
only
more
admitted
the
existence
of
a
separate
nation
but
thought
a
convenient
fiction
that
it
did
not
exist
necessary
to
the
modern
state
this
ignorance
or
fiction
has
broken
down
in
our
own
time
partly
through
the
necessary
reaction
of
truth
against
any
falsehood
partly
through
the
increasing
numbers
of
the
jews
in
western
countries
more
through
the
great
increase
of
their
power
yet
though
this
old
liberal
fiction
about
the
jews
is
dead
having
proved
unworkable
in
the
face
of
fact
it
had
something
to
be
said
for
it
it
secured
peace
for
a
while
it
chose
models
from
the
past
and
it
was
based
on
a
certain
truth
to
wit
that
the
jew
takes
on
very
rapidly
the
superficial
characters
of
the
nation
in
which
he
happens
for
the
time
to
be
living
moreover
it
was
desired
by
the
jews
themselves
example
of
the
old
jewish
peer
and
his
claim
to
be
let
alone
practical
proof
of
the
failure
in
his
case
at
any
rate
the
old
liberal
fiction
is
now
quite
useless
the
problem
is
admitted
and
must
be
solved
chapter
iii
the
present
phase
of
the
problem
the
jewish
problem
present
throughout
history
has
assumed
a
particular
character
it
is
the
character
of
a
sharp
reaction
against
the
old
pretence
that
jews
were
identical
with
the
nations
in
which
they
happened
to
live
it
first
took
the
form
of
irritation
only
it
was
suddenly
exasperated
in
a
very
high
degree
by
the
jewish
revolution
in
russia
but
long
before
this
the
increasing
power
of
jews
in
public
life
the
writing
on
the
continent
the
dreyfus
agitation
the
south
african
war
and
the
jewish
leadership
of
socialism
had
prepared
the
way
the
situation
on
the
outbreak
of
the
great
war
bolshevism
a
short
description
to
be
expanded
in
a
later
chapter
bolshevism
is
a
jewish
movement
not
a
movement
of
the
jewish
race
as
a
its
particular
effect
was
to
release
criticism
of
jewish
power
which
had
hitherto
been
silent
from
fear
of
or
sympathy
with
capitalism
men
hesitated
to
attack
the
jews
as
financiers
because
the
stability
of
society
and
of
their
own
fortunes
was
bound
up
with
finance
but
when
a
body
of
jews
also
appeared
as
the
active
enemies
of
existing
society
and
of
private
fortune
the
restraint
was
removed
since
the
bolshevist
movement
open
and
hostile
discussion
of
the
jewish
problem
has
become
universal
chapter
iv
the
general
causes
of
friction
the
strain
between
jewry
and
its
hosts
in
islam
and
christendom
much
older
than
any
modern
cause
can
account
for
the
true
causes
are
both
general
and
particular
i
call
those
which
are
ineradicable
and
proceed
from
the
contrasting
natures
of
the
two
races
those
which
depend
upon
the
will
on
either
side
and
can
be
modified
to
the
advantage
of
both
the
general
cause
of
friction
being
a
contrast
in
fundamental
character
we
note
that
the
common
accusations
brought
against
jews
are
false
as
are
the
common
praises
given
him
by
those
not
of
the
in
each
case
what
has
to
be
noted
is
not
a
series
of
virtues
or
vices
special
to
the
jew
but
the
racial
character
or
tone
of
each
quality
these
examined
the
jewish
courage
examples
the
jewish
generosity
the
strength
of
jewish
patriotism
the
consequent
indifference
to
our
national
feelings
accusations
arising
therefrom
especially
in
time
of
war
the
jewish
power
of
concentration
of
eloquence
the
jewish
tendency
to
push
a
jewish
success
and
hide
a
jewish
failure
or
danger
the
evil
effects
of
this
tendency
in
our
mutual
relations
the
poverty
of
the
jewish
people
false
effect
produced
by
a
few
great
jewish
fortunes
the
instability
of
these
cringing
of
wealthy
europeans
to
jewish
dependence
of
our
politicians
on
wealthy
jews
evil
effect
of
this
in
the
attempt
to
regulate
domestic
affairs
of
eastern
europe
the
ill
effect
of
the
partially
jewish
financial
monopoly
especially
with
parliamentary
corruption
as
pronounced
as
it
is
chapter
v
the
special
causes
of
friction
i
have
called
special
causes
of
friction
those
which
are
remedial
at
will
by
either
party
they
would
seem
to
be
on
the
jewish
side
the
habit
of
secrecy
and
the
habit
of
expressing
a
sense
of
superiority
on
our
side
a
disingenuousness
and
unintelligence
in
our
treatment
of
jews
and
a
lack
of
charity
the
deplorable
jewish
habit
of
secrecy
the
use
of
false
names
examples
excuses
for
same
not
adequate
a
regular
code
of
such
names
which
deceive
us
but
can
be
decoded
by
fellow
jews
the
expression
of
superiority
by
the
jew
our
statesmanship
has
never
sufficiently
allowed
for
it
examples
of
this
expression
jewish
interference
in
our
religion
or
national
quarrels
and
other
departments
which
are
alien
to
jewish
interests
on
the
other
hand
this
quality
has
been
a
preservation
of
the
race
the
jew
should
note
the
corresponding
sense
of
superiority
on
our
side
even
the
poor
if
he
be
of
european
blood
feels
himself
superior
to
the
jewish
millionaire
chapter
vi
the
cause
of
friction
upon
our
side
this
department
of
our
inquiry
often
neglected
through
an
error
it
is
presumed
that
because
we
are
the
hosts
and
the
jew
alien
to
us
no
responsibility
falls
on
us
this
error
forgets
that
the
jew
is
permanently
with
us
and
that
every
permanent
human
relation
involves
responsibility
the
first
cause
of
friction
on
our
side
is
in
our
dealings
with
the
jew
examples
of
this
we
conceal
from
the
jew
our
real
feelings
we
deceive
him
the
richer
classes
who
intermarry
with
jews
and
enter
into
business
partnership
with
them
especially
to
blame
the
populace
more
straightforward
this
deceiving
of
the
jew
leaves
him
troubled
when
the
quarrel
comes
to
a
head
he
has
not
heard
what
is
said
behind
his
back
disingenuousness
in
our
suppression
of
the
jewish
problem
in
history
gross
examples
of
it
in
contemporary
life
and
particularly
in
the
popular
press
jews
called
russians
germans
anything
but
what
they
are
unintelligence
a
second
cause
of
friction
example
our
treatment
of
jewish
immigration
we
hate
it
yet
allow
it
because
we
dare
not
give
it
its
right
name
unintelligent
treatment
of
the
jew
in
fiction
unintelligence
in
our
astonishment
at
his
international
position
example
of
the
cabinet
minister
cousin
who
got
into
trouble
last
cause
lack
of
charity
people
wo
put
themselves
in
the
shoes
of
the
jew
and
see
how
things
look
from
side
we
do
not
as
we
should
mix
with
jews
of
every
class
and
address
their
societies
summary
a
warning
against
the
idea
that
the
friction
between
the
jews
and
ourselves
is
unimportant
it
has
bred
catastrophe
in
the
past
and
may
in
the
future
chapter
vii
the
error
of
neglecting
to
study
on
account
of
its
extravagance
it
is
a
most
significant
thing
however
character
of
the
he
does
not
recognize
a
jewish
problem
to
be
solved
but
only
a
jewish
race
to
be
hated
this
hatred
his
whole
motive
his
his
delusion
his
strength
the
press
still
on
the
whole
boycotts
the
movement
but
it
is
growing
prodigiously
its
great
power
of
its
vast
accumulation
of
evidence
effect
this
will
have
when
it
comes
out
the
jews
met
by
nothing
but
ridicule
this
weapon
insufficient
and
bound
to
fail
their
enemies
have
countered
it
by
accumulating
the
latter
a
much
stronger
weapon
so
long
as
the
erroneous
jewish
policy
of
secrecy
is
maintained
danger
to
the
jews
of
the
movement
because
of
its
intensity
because
of
its
formidable
accumulation
of
evidence
which
can
not
be
permanently
suppressed
and
most
important
because
it
is
allied
to
a
now
widespread
and
more
moderate
but
very
hostile
feeling
to
which
it
acts
as
chapter
viii
bolshevism
the
revolution
in
russia
will
be
the
historical
point
of
departure
whence
will
date
the
renewed
hostility
to
the
jew
in
western
europe
examination
of
that
revolution
it
was
as
said
in
chapter
iii
jewish
movement
not
a
movement
of
the
jewish
importance
of
this
distinction
unfortunately
the
two
different
terms
jewish
race
and
a
jewish
movement
are
confused
in
the
popular
mind
the
revolution
not
the
result
of
an
accident
or
of
a
universal
plot
element
of
racial
revenge
the
jew
not
a
revolutionary
special
character
of
the
russian
situation
industrial
capitalism
the
great
evil
of
our
time
there
recent
and
weak
therefore
open
to
special
attack
an
international
evil
the
only
two
international
forces
applicable
were
the
jews
and
the
catholic
church
why
the
catholic
church
can
not
attack
industrial
capitalism
why
the
jew
who
happens
to
be
opposed
to
it
can
and
does
directly
attack
it
neither
our
instinct
for
property
nor
our
nationalism
an
obstacle
in
his
case
grave
perils
to
the
jew
arise
from
his
identification
with
bolshevism
the
more
reason
to
meet
these
perils
by
a
sane
treatment
of
the
jewish
problem
chapter
ix
the
position
in
the
world
as
a
whole
the
jewish
problem
varies
according
to
the
extent
to
which
jews
have
acquired
control
and
domination
in
various
places
according
to
the
tradition
of
each
community
in
approaching
the
problem
according
to
the
strength
in
each
community
of
the
four
international
forces
which
are
the
catholic
church
islam
industrial
capitalism
and
the
socialist
revolt
against
this
last
the
individual
jew
does
not
feel
that
he
is
in
a
position
of
control
or
even
that
he
is
interfering

chapter
i
the
thesis
of
this
book
it
is
the
thesis
of
this
book
that
the
continued
presence
of
the
jewish
nation
intermixed
with
other
nations
alien
to
it
presents
a
permanent
problem
of
the
gravest
character
that
the
wholly
different
culture
tradition
race
and
religion
of
europe
make
europe
a
permanent
antagonist
to
israel
and
that
the
recent
and
rapid
intensification
of
that
antagonism
gives
to
the
discovery
of
a
solution
immediate
and
highly
practical
importance
for
if
the
quarrel
is
allowed
to
rise
unchecked
and
to
proceed
unappeased
we
shall
come
unexpectedly
and
soon
upon
one
of
these
tragedies
which
have
marked
for
centuries
the
relations
between
this
peculiar
nation
and
ourselves
the
jewish
problem
is
one
to
which
no
true
parallel
can
be
found
for
the
historical
and
social
phenomenon
which
has
produced
it
is
unique
it
is
a
problem
which
can
not
be
shirked
as
the
last
generation
both
of
jews
and
of
their
hosts
attempted
to
shirk
it
it
is
a
problem
which
can
not
be
avoided
nor
even
lessened
as
can
some
social
problems
by
an
healing
effect
of
time
for
it
is
increasing
before
our
eyes
it
must
be
met
and
dealt
with
openly
and
now
that
problem
is
the
problem
of
reducing
or
accommodating
the
strain
produced
by
the
presence
of
an
alien
body
within
any
organism
the
alien
body
sets
up
strains
or
to
change
the
metaphor
produces
a
friction
which
is
evil
both
to
itself
and
to
the
organism
which
it
inhabits
the
problem
is
how
to
relax
those
strains
for
good
and
to
set
things
permanently
at
their
ease
again
there
are
two
ways
to
such
a
desirable
end
the
first
is
by
the
elimination
of
what
is
alien
the
second
is
by
its
segregation
there
is
no
other
way
the
elimination
of
an
alien
body
may
take
three
forms
it
may
take
a
frankly
hostile
form
elimination
by
destruction
it
may
take
a
form
also
hostile
but
less
hostile
elimination
by
expulsion
it
may
take
a
third
form
an
amicable
one
and
that
far
the
most
commonly
found
in
the
natural
process
of
physical
nature
and
of
society
elimination
by
absorption
the
alien
body
becomes
an
indistinguishable
part
of
the
organism
in
which
it
was
originally
a
source
of
disturbance
and
is
lost
in
it
these
three
ways
sum
up
the
first
method
the
method
of
elimination
the
second
method
if
elimination
shall
prove
impossible
or
undesirable
is
that
of
segregation
and
this
again
may
be
of
two
kinds
hostile
and
amicable
we
may
segregate
the
alien
element
without
regard
to
its
own
ends
or
desires
the
segregation
of
it
being
upon
a
plan
framed
solely
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
organism
invaded
and
the
reduction
of
the
strain
or
friction
it
creates
effected
by
the
mere
cutting
of
it
off
from
all
avenues
through
which
it
can
affect
its
host
but
we
may
also
segregate
the
alien
irritant
by
an
action
which
takes
full
account
of
the
thing
segregated
as
well
as
of
the
organism
segregating
it
and
considers
the
good
of
both
parties
in
this
second
and
amicable
policy
the
word
segregation
which
has
a
bad
connotation
may
be
replaced
by
the
word
this
book
has
been
written
under
the
conception
that
all
solutions
of
the
jewish
problem
other
than
this
last
are
either
impracticable
or
bad
in
morals
or
both
it
is
written
to
advocate
a
policy
wherein
the
jews
on
their
side
shall
openly
recognize
their
wholly
separate
nationality
and
we
on
ours
shall
equally
recognize
that
separate
nationality
treat
it
without
reserve
as
an
alien
thing
and
respect
it
as
a
province
of
society
outside
our
own
it
is
written
under
the
conviction
that
any
attitude
which
falls
short
of
this
policy
or
is
very
different
from
it
will
now
soon
breed
disaster
the
solution
by
way
of
destruction
is
not
only
abominable
in
morals
but
has
proved
futile
in
practice
it
has
been
the
constant
temptation
of
angry
popular
masses
in
the
past
when
the
jewish
problem
has
come
to
a
head
not
once
but
a
thousand
times
in
various
parts
of
our
civilization
during
the
last
twenty
centuries
from
the
pitiless
massacres
of
cyrenaica
in
the
second
century
to
the
latest
murders
in
the
ukraine
that
solution
has
been
attempted
and
has
failed
it
has
invariably
left
behind
it
a
dreadful
inheritance
of
hatred
upon
the
one
side
and
of
shame
upon
the
other
it
has
been
condemned
by
every
man
whose
judgment
is
worth
considering
and
especially
by
the
great
moral
teachers
of
christendom
it
is
indeed
hardly
a
policy
at
all
for
it
is
blind
it
is
a
gesture
of
mere
exasperation
and
not
a
final
gesture
at
that
the
second
form
of
elimination
expulsion
though
theoretically
sustainable
for
a
community
has
a
right
to
organize
its
own
life
and
no
aliens
therein
have
a
claim
to
modify
that
life
or
to
disturb
it
is
none
the
less
in
practice
and
as
regards
this
particular
problem
only
one
degree
less
odious
than
the
first
it
means
inevitably
a
mass
of
individual
injustice
as
well
as
common
spoliation
and
every
other
hardship
it
is
almost
impossible
to
dissociate
it
from
violence
and
ill
deeds
of
all
kinds
it
leaves
behind
it
almost
as
strong
an
inheritance
if
not
of
shame
on
the
one
side
at
any
rate
of
rancour
upon
the
other
as
does
the
first
and
what
condemns
it
finally
is
that
it
is
not
and
can
not
be
complete
for
it
is
in
the
nature
of
the
jewish
problem
that
this
solution
is
only
attempted
at
moments
and
in
places
where
the
strength
of
the
jews
has
declined
and
this
invariably
means
their
corresponding
strength
in
some
other
quarter
a
particular
society
attempting
this
solution
of
expulsion
may
succeed
for
a
time
so
far
as
itself
is
concerned
but
that
inevitably
means
the
reception
of
the
exiled
body
by
another
district
and
sooner
or
later
the
return
of
the
force
which
it
was
hoped
to
be
rid
of
the
greatest
historical
example
of
this
is
of
course
the
action
of
the
english
the
english
alone
of
all
christian
nations
did
adopt
this
solution
in
its
entirety
a
strong
national
kingship
a
government
highly
organized
for
its
time
an
insular
position
and
a
singular
unanimity
of
national
purpose
promoted
the
expulsion
of
the
jews
from
england
at
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
more
than
three
and
a
half
centuries
that
expulsion
was
maintained
and
england
alone
of
the
various
divisions
of
christendom
was
in
theory
free
of
the
alien
element
and
nearly
as
free
in
practice
as
it
was
in
theory
but
as
we
all
know
in
the
long
run
the
experiment
broke
down
the
jews
were
readmitted
in
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
nowhere
have
they
come
to
greater
strength
than
in
the
very
nation
which
attempted
this
solution
of
the
problem
with
such
drastic
thoroughness
five
hundred
years
ago
none
of
the
other
parallel
attempts
up
and
down
europe
were
of
the
same
thoroughness
as
the
english
attempt
their
failure
came
therefore
more
quickly
but
such
failure
would
seem
in
any
case
to
be
inevitable
quite
apart
therefore
from
the
moral
objection
which
attaches
to
it
there
is
the
practical
experience
that
a
solution
is
not
to
be
found
upon
such
lines
lastly
there
is
elimination
by
absorption
this
would
obviously
be
the
most
gentle
as
it
is
the
most
evident
of
all
methods
it
is
further
a
normal
and
most
usual
method
of
nature
herself
when
a
living
organism
has
to
deal
with
disturbance
excited
by
the
presence
of
an
alien
body
so
natural
and
so
obvious
is
it
that
it
has
been
taken
by
many
men
of
excellent
judgment
upon
both
sides
as
a
matter
of
course
it
has
been
taken
for
granted
that
if
absorption
has
not
taken
place
in
the
past
it
has
only
been
due
to
an
artificially
nourished
and
maintained
against
the
jews
on
our
side
or
by
the
unreasoning
exclusiveness
of
the
jews
on
theirs
even
in
spite
of
a
vast
increase
during
our
own
generation
both
in
the
public
appreciation
of
the
problem
and
in
its
immediate
gravity
there
are
very
many
men
who
still
regard
absorption
as
the
natural
end
of
the
affair
these
though
dwindling
are
still
numerous
upon
the
side
upon
the
other
the
jewish
side
they
are
i
think
a
very
small
body
for
i
note
that
even
those
jews
who
think
absorption
will
come
admit
it
with
regret
and
certainly
the
vast
majority
would
insist
with
pride
upon
the
certain
survival
of
israel
but
here
again
i
maintain
that
we
have
the
index
of
history
against
us
in
point
of
fact
absorption
has
not
taken
place
it
has
had
a
better
chance
than
any
corresponding
case
can
show
ample
time
in
which
to
work
wide
dispersion
constant
intermarriage
long
periods
of
tolerant
friendship
for
the
jew
and
even
at
times
his
ascendancy
if
ever
there
were
conditions
under
which
one
might
imagine
that
the
larger
body
would
absorb
the
smaller
they
were
those
of
christendom
acting
intimately
for
centuries
in
relation
with
jewry
nation
after
nation
has
absorbed
larger
intensely
hostile
minorities
the
irish
their
successive
invaders
the
british
the
pirates
of
the
fifth
and
eighth
centuries
and
the
french
of
three
centuries
more
the
northern
gauls
their
auxiliaries
the
italians
the
lombards
the
greeks
the
slav
the
dacian
has
absorbed
even
the
mongol
but
the
jew
has
remained
intact
however
we
explain
this
mystically
or
in
whatever
other
fashion
we
can
not
deny
its
truth
it
is
true
of
the
jews
and
of
the
jews
alone
that
they
alone
have
maintained
whether
through
the
special
action
of
providence
or
through
some
general
biological
or
social
law
of
which
we
are
ignorant
an
unfailing
entity
and
an
equally
unfailing
differentiation
between
themselves
and
the
society
through
which
they
ceaselessly
move
it
is
not
true
that
conditions
in
the
past
differed
from
present
conditions
sufficiently
to
account
for
so
strange
a
story
there
have
been
generations
and
even
centuries
not
indeed
throughout
the
world
but
applying
now
to
one
country
now
to
another
where
every
opportunity
for
absorption
existed
yet
that
absorption
has
never
taken
place
there
was
every
chance
in
spain
at
one
moment
in
poland
at
another
but
there
was
the
best
chance
of
all
in
the
short
but
brilliant
period
of
liberal
policy
which
has
dominated
western
europe
during
the
last
three
generations
that
policy
has
had
the
fullest
play
it
has
left
the
jews
not
only
unabsorbed
but
more
differentiated
than
ever
and
the
political
problem
they
present
more
insistent
by
far
than
it
was
a
century
ago
the
thing
might
have
come
where
there
was
a
chaos
of
peoples
as
in
pagan
alexandria
in
the
four
centuries
from
to
or
in
modern
new
york
it
might
have
come
where
there
was
a
particularly
friendly
attitude
as
in
mediaeval
poland
or
modern
england
it
might
even
have
come
paradoxically
through
the
very
persecution
and
strain
of
times
and
places
where
the
jews
suffered
the
most
hostile
treatment
for
their
absorption
might
have
been
achieved
under
pressure
though
it
had
failed
to
be
achieved
under
attraction
as
a
fact
it
has
never
come
it
has
never
proved
possible
the
continuous
absorption
of
outlying
fractions
a
process
continually
going
on
wherever
the
jewish
nation
is
present
has
not
affected
the
mass
of
the
problem
at
all
the
body
as
a
whole
has
remained
separate
differentiated
with
a
strong
identity
of
its
own
under
all
conditions
and
in
all
places
and
the
reasoning
by
which
men
come
to
think
this
solution
reasonable
is
nullified
by
an
experience
apparent
throughout
history
that
experience
is
wholly
against
any
such
solution
it
can
not
be
there
remains
then
only
the
solution
of
segregation
a
word
which
i
repeat
i
use
in
a
completely
neutral
manner
though
it
has
unhappily
obtained
in
this
and
other
issues
a
bad
connotation
segregation
as
i
have
said
may
be
of
two
kinds
it
may
be
hostile
a
sort
of
static
expulsion
a
putting
aside
of
the
alien
body
without
regard
to
that
body
needs
desires
or
claims
the
building
of
a
fence
round
it
as
it
were
solely
with
the
object
of
defending
the
organism
which
reacts
against
invasion
and
suffers
from
the
presence
within
it
of
something
different
from
itself
or
it
may
take
an
amicable
form
and
may
be
a
mutual
arrangement
a
recognition
with
mutual
advantage
of
a
reality
which
is
unavoidable
by
either
party
the
first
of
these
apparent
solutions
has
been
attempted
over
and
over
again
throughout
history
it
has
had
long
periods
of
partial
success
but
never
any
period
of
complete
success
for
it
has
invariably
left
behind
it
a
sense
of
injustice
upon
the
jewish
side
and
of
moral
upon
the
other
there
remains
i
take
it
no
practical
or
permanent
solution
but
the
last
it
is
to
this
conclusion
that
my
essay
is
meant
to
lead
if
the
jewish
nation
comes
to
express
its
own
pride
and
patriotism
openly
and
openly
to
admit
the
necessary
limitations
imposed
by
that
if
we
on
our
side
frankly
accept
the
presence
of
this
nation
as
a
thing
utterly
different
from
ourselves
but
with
just
as
good
a
right
to
existence
as
we
have
if
we
renounce
our
pretences
in
the
matter
if
we
talk
of
and
recognize
the
jewish
people
freely
and
without
fear
as
a
separate
body
if
upon
both
sides
the
realities
of
the
situation
are
admitted
with
the
consequent
and
necessary
definitions
which
those
realities
imply
we
shall
have
peace
the
advantage
both
parties
the
small
but
intense
jewish
minority
the
great
majority
in
the
midst
of
which
that
minority
acts
would
discover
in
such
an
arrangement
is
manifest
if
it
could
be
maintained
as
i
think
it
could
be
maintained
the
problem
would
be
permanently
solved
at
any
rate
if
it
can
not
be
solved
in
that
way
it
certainly
can
not
be
solved
in
any
other
and
if
we
do
not
get
peace
by
this
avenue
then
we
are
doomed
to
the
perpetual
recurrence
of
those
persecutions
which
have
marred
the
history
of
europe
since
the
first
consolidation
of
the
roman
empire
it
has
been
a
series
of
cycles
invariably
following
the
same
steps
the
jew
comes
to
an
alien
society
at
first
in
small
numbers
he
thrives
his
presence
is
not
resented
he
is
rather
treated
as
a
friend
whether
from
mere
contrast
in
type
what
i
have
called
friction
or
from
some
apparent
divergence
between
his
objects
and
those
of
his
hosts
or
through
his
increasing
numbers
he
creates
or
discovers
a
growing
animosity
he
resents
it
he
opposes
his
hosts
they
call
themselves
masters
in
their
own
house
the
jew
resists
their
claim
it
comes
to
violence
it
is
always
the
same
miserable
sequence
first
a
welcome
then
a
growing
next
a
culmination
in
acute
lastly
catastrophe
and
disaster
insult
persecution
even
massacre
the
exiles
flying
from
the
place
of
persecution
into
a
new
district
where
the
jew
is
hardly
known
where
the
problem
has
never
existed
or
has
been
forgotten
he
meets
again
with
the
largest
hospitality
there
follows
here
also
after
a
period
of
amicable
interfusion
a
growing
which
next
becomes
acute
and
leads
to
new
explosions
and
so
on
in
a
fatal
round
if
we
are
to
stop
that
wheel
from
its
perpetual
and
tragic
turning
there
seems
to
be
no
method
save
that
for
which
i
plead
the
opposition
to
it
is
diverse
and
formidable
but
can
everywhere
be
reduced
upon
analysis
to
some
form
of
falsehood
this
falsehood
takes
the
shape
of
denying
the
existence
of
the
problem
of
remaining
silent
upon
it
or
of
pretending
friendly
emotions
in
public
commerce
which
are
belied
by
every
phrase
and
gesture
admitted
in
private
or
it
takes
the
shape
of
defining
the
problem
in
false
terms
in
proclaiming
it
essentially
religious
whereas
it
is
essentially
national
worst
of
all
it
may
be
that
very
modern
kind
of
falsehood
a
statement
of
the
truth
accompanied
by
a
statement
of
its
contradiction
like
the
precious
modern
lie
that
one
can
be
a
patriot
and
at
the
same
time
international
in
the
case
of
the
jews
this
particular
modern
lie
takes
the
shape
of
admitting
that
they
are
wholly
alien
to
us
and
different
from
us
of
talking
of
them
as
such
and
even
writing
of
them
as
such
and
yet
in
another
connection
talking
and
writing
of
them
as
though
no
such
violent
contrast
were
present
that
pretence
of
reconciling
contradictions
is
the
lie
in
the
soul
its
punishment
is
immediate
for
those
who
indulge
it
are
blinded
all
opposition
that
ever
i
have
met
to
the
solution
here
proposed
is
an
opposition
sprung
from
the
spirit
of
untruth
and
if
there
were
no
other
argument
in
favour
of
an
honest
and
moral
settlement
of
the
dispute
the
one
argument
based
on
truth
would
i
think
be
sufficient
it
is
a
social
truth
that
there
is
a
jewish
nation
alien
to
us
and
therefore
irritant
it
is
a
moral
truth
that
expulsion
and
worse
are
remedies
to
be
avoided
it
is
an
historical
truth
that
those
solutions
have
always
ultimately
failed
the
recognition
of
those
three
truths
alone
will
set
us
right
such
is
the
main
thesis
of
this
book
but
it
needs
an
addition
if
its
full
spirit
is
to
be
apprehended
and
that
addition
i
have
attempted
to
express
in
the
last
chapter
if
the
solution
i
propose
be
the
right
solution
it
yet
remains
to
be
determined
whether
it
should
first
take
the
form
of
new
laws
from
which
a
new
spirit
may
be
expected
to
grow
or
first
take
the
form
of
a
new
spirit
and
practice
from
which
new
laws
shall
spring
the
order
is
of
essential
importance
for
to
mistake
it
to
reverse
the
true
sequence
of
cause
and
effect
is
the
prime
cause
of
failure
in
all
social
reform
as
will
be
seen
by
those
who
have
the
patience
to
read
to
the
end
of
my
book
i
have
in
its
last
pages
pleaded
strongly
for
the
policy
it
would
be
impossible
to
frame
in
our
society
and
in
face
of
the
rapidly
rising
tide
of
antagonism
against
the
jews
new
laws
that
would
not
lead
to
injustice
but
if
it
be
possible
to
create
an
atmosphere
wherein
the
jews
are
spoken
of
openly
and
they
in
their
turn
admit
define
and
accept
the
consequences
of
a
separate
nationality
in
our
midst
such
a
spirit
once
established
laws
and
regulations
consonant
to
it
will
naturally
follow
but
i
am
convinced
that
the
reversing
of
this
process
would
only
lead
first
to
confusion
and
next
to
disaster
both
for
israel
and
for
ourselves
the
denial
of
the
problem
chapter
ii
the
denial
of
the
problem
i
have
stated
the
problem
there
is
friction
between
the
two
races
the
jews
in
their
dispersion
and
those
among
whom
they
live
this
friction
is
growing
acute
it
has
led
invariably
in
the
past
and
consequently
may
lead
now
to
the
most
fearful
consequences
terrible
for
the
jew
but
evil
also
for
us
therefore
that
the
problem
is
immediate
practical
and
grave
therefore
a
solution
is
imperative
but
i
may
be
and
indeed
i
shall
be
met
at
the
outset
by
the
denial
that
any
such
problem
exists
such
was
the
attitude
of
all
our
immediate
past
such
is
the
attitude
of
many
of
the
best
men
on
both
sides
of
the
gulf
which
separates
israel
from
our
world
i
must
meet
this
objection
before
going
further
for
if
it
be
sound
if
indeed
there
is
no
problem
save
what
may
be
created
by
ignorance
or
malice
then
no
solution
is
demanded
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
enlighten
the
ignorant
and
to
repress
the
malicious
the
ignorant
who
imagine
there
is
an
alien
jewish
nation
among
them
the
malicious
who
treat
as
though
they
were
alien
men
who
are
in
fact
exactly
like
ourselves
and
normal
i
do
not
here
allude
to
the
great
mass
of
convention
hypocrisy
and
fear
which
pretends
ignorance
of
a
truth
it
well
knows
i
am
speaking
of
the
sincere
conviction
still
present
in
many
particularly
those
of
the
older
generation
that
no
jewish
problem
exists
it
is
honestly
denied
by
a
certain
type
of
mind
that
there
is
any
such
thing
as
a
jewish
nation
there
can
therefore
be
no
friction
between
it
and
its
hosts
the
thing
is
a
delusion
let
us
examine
that
mind
and
see
whether
the
illusion
is
on
our
side
or
no
it
was
the
attitude
familiar
to
the
nineteenth
century
and
agreeable
to
that
one
of
its
political
moods
in
which
it
found
itself
best
satisfied
the
negative
attitude
of
leaving
the
jewish
nation
unrecognized
of
creating
a
fiction
of
single
citizenship
to
replace
the
reality
of
dual
allegiance
of
calling
a
jew
a
full
member
of
whatever
society
he
happened
to
inhabit
during
whatever
space
of
time
he
happened
to
sojourn
there
in
his
wanderings
across
the
earth
that
was
the
attitude
agreeable
on
the
political
side
to
everything
which
called
itself
modern
thought
such
was
the
doctrine
proposed
by
the
great
men
of
the
french
revolution
such
was
the
attitude
accepted
almost
enthusiastically
by
liberal
england
that
is
by
all
the
dominant
public
life
of
england
during
the
victorian
period
such
was
the
policy
which
once
obtained
universal
favour
throughout
the
whole
of
our
western
civilization
that
was
the
attitude
which
the
west
actually
attempted
to
impose
upon
eastern
states
and
the
last
effect
of
its
credit
is
to
be
found
in
certain
clauses
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
for
that
attitude
is
still
the
official
attitude
of
all
our
governments
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
the
other
treaties
following
the
great
war
the
jews
of
eastern
europe
were
put
under
a
sort
of
special
protection
but
not
in
a
straightforward
and
positive
fashion
the
word
jew
was
never
blurted
out
it
was
replaced
by
the
word
minority
but
the
intention
was
obvious
the
underlying
implication
was
we
the
western
governments
say
there
is
no
jewish
problem
the
idea
of
a
jewish
nation
is
a
delusion
and
the
conception
of
the
jew
as
something
different
from
a
pole
or
a
rumanian
is
a
mania
if
you
in
the
east
are
still
benighted
in
this
matter
at
any
rate
we
will
prevent
your
ignorance
or
obsession
from
leading
you
to
persecution
the
same
men
who
made
these
declarations
proceeded
to
erect
a
jewish
state
in
palestine
with
the
threat
behind
it
of
ruthlessly
suppressing
a
by
the
use
of
western
arms
both
actions
were
the
consequence
of
that
confused
position
i
have
just
defined
history
will
call
it
the
example
which
though
much
weakened
in
public
opinion
was
still
honestly
taken
for
granted
by
of
the
parliamentarians
who
framed
the
treaty
and
was
certainly
felt
to
be
of
personal
advantage
to
the
position
that
there
is
no
jewish
nation
when
the
admission
of
it
may
inconvenience
the
jew
but
very
much
of
a
jewish
nation
when
it
can
advantage
him
those
who
defended
this
position
did
so
from
various
standpoints
but
these
may
all
be
regarded
as
so
many
degrees
in
a
certain
way
of
looking
at
the
jewish
people
it
was
till
lately
the
attitude
of
the
majority
of
educated
frenchmen
englishmen
and
italians
it
was
so
to
speak
the
political
attitude
of
western
europe
with
its
parliamentary
governments
and
other
corresponding
institutions
the
most
extreme
form
of
this
opinion
was
to
be
found
in
people
who
spoke
of
the
jew
as
nothing
other
than
a
citizen
with
a
particular
religion
a
state
would
be
dominantly
catholic
or
protestant
but
it
would
contain
smaller
religious
bodies
eager
minorities
for
which
a
place
had
to
be
found
side
by
side
with
the
more
or
less
indifferent
majority
catholic
france
had
a
five
per
cent
and
wealthy
huguenot
minority
protestant
england
had
a
seven
per
cent
and
poor
catholic
minority
protestant
holland
had
a
large
minority
more
than
a
third
of
catholics
and
so
forth
it
had
become
odious
to
nineteenth
century
thought
that
religious
differences
which
it
regarded
as
nothing
more
than
shades
of
private
opinion
should
be
the
concern
of
the
state
a
large
number
of
people
thought
of
the
jews
not
as
a
race
but
only
as
a
religion
and
regarding
all
religion
thus
they
concluded
that
it
could
involve
no
diminution
of
citizenship
at
the
other
end
of
the
scale
you
had
public
men
who
fully
appreciated
the
ultimate
difficulties
which
would
certainly
arise
from
this
inconclusive
settlement
of
the
matter
these
regarded
the
jews
as
a
quite
distinct
nationality
and
even
as
a
nationality
likely
to
clash
with
the
national
needs
of
its
hosts
they
would
even
in
private
express
their
hostility
towards
that
nationality
none
the
less
they
thought
it
must
be
treated
in
public
life
as
though
it
did
not
exist
these
men
were
most
emphatic
in
their
private
letters
and
conversation
that
the
jewish
problem
was
a
religious
but
a
national
one
nevertheless
they
said
it
was
necessary
to
mask
that
problem
by
a
fiction
and
to
that
the
jew
was
just
like
everybody
else
save
for
his
religion
all
other
solutions
they
said
demanded
a
knowledge
of
history
and
of
europe
not
to
be
expected
of
the
public
at
large
again
the
jews
were
so
powerful
that
if
desired
the
fiction
to
be
supported
they
must
be
humoured
at
any
rate
recourse
must
be
had
in
our
time
at
least
to
this
to
the
new
and
already
antagonistic
attitude
towards
the
jews
now
rising
so
strongly
everywhere
throughout
western
europe
which
is
in
part
a
reaction
from
the
nineteenth
century
position
this
way
of
denying
the
jewish
race
or
ignoring
its
existence
by
a
fiction
appears
morally
odious
and
we
wonder
why
it
commanded
universal
support
it
involved
a
falsehood
of
course
often
a
conscious
falsehood
and
it
was
also
undignified
for
there
appears
to
our
generation
something
as
grotesque
in
denying
the
existence
of
the
jewish
nation
as
in
denying
our
own
but
that
the
fiction
was
maintained
sincerely
and
that
the
grotesque
and
undignified
side
of
it
went
unperceived
we
can
assure
ourselves
in
a
few
moments
converse
with
any
one
of
that
older
generation
which
maintained
it
and
still
represents
it
among
us
it
might
have
continued
to
flourish
for
yet
another
generation
at
any
rate
among
the
leading
classes
of
this
commercial
community
but
for
two
new
developments
which
broke
it
down
each
development
the
result
of
so
large
a
toleration
the
first
was
the
growth
of
numbers
the
second
of
influence
what
made
that
old
falsehood
glaring
and
that
old
grotesque
apparent
was
the
enormous
increase
throughout
all
the
west
of
the
jewish
poor
accompanied
by
the
enormous
increase
of
the
power
exercised
by
the
jewish
rich
in
public
affairs
men
grew
angry
at
finding
themselves
pledged
to
a
pretence
that
jews
were
not
when
their
presence
was
everywhere
unavoidable
in
the
streets
and
in
the
offices
of
government
the
fiction
was
possible
when
a
very
few
financiers
mixed
with
and
lost
in
the
polite
world
were
alone
concerned
it
became
impossible
in
the
face
of
the
vast
new
ghettoes
of
london
manchester
bradford
glasgow
and
the
formidable
and
growing
list
of
jewish
and
ministers
viceroys
ambassadors
dictators
of
policy
this
contempt
for
and
irritation
with
what
i
have
called
the
nineteenth
century
attitude
the
liberal
attitude
was
already
apparent
before
the
end
of
that
century
it
was
muttering
during
the
south
african
war
in
england
and
the
dreyfus
case
in
france
it
became
vocal
in
the
first
years
of
this
century
especially
in
connection
with
parliamentary
scandals
with
the
bolshevist
rising
in
it
became
clamorous
it
will
certainly
grow
we
already
have
a
formidable
minority
prepared
to
act
against
the
interest
of
the
jew
it
will
in
all
probability
become
and
that
shortly
a
majority
it
may
appear
at
any
moment
on
some
critical
occasion
on
some
new
provocation
as
an
overwhelming
flood
of
exasperated
opinion
all
the
more
does
it
behove
us
to
treat
the
neutrality
and
fiction
fairly
to
examine
it
even
with
a
bias
in
its
favour
to
set
down
all
that
can
be
said
in
its
defence
before
we
reject
it
as
i
think
we
must
now
all
reluctantly
reject
it
i
say
reluctantly
for
after
all
it
was
the
fixed
mood
of
our
fathers
who
did
great
things
we
feel
their
reproach
when
we
abandon
it
and
there
are
still
present
with
us
very
many
of
our
elders
to
whom
our
new
anxiety
is
abhorrent
we
must
remember
in
the
first
place
that
the
treating
of
the
jew
in
the
west
as
no
jew
at
all
but
a
plain
citizen
like
the
rest
worked
well
enough
for
a
time
one
might
almost
say
that
there
was
no
jewish
problem
consciously
present
to
the
mind
of
the
average
educated
englishman
or
frenchman
italian
or
even
western
german
between
say
the
years
and
a
very
small
body
of
jews
in
england
and
france
in
italy
and
the
rest
of
the
west
were
vaguely
associated
with
wealth
in
the
popular
mind
a
large
proportion
of
them
were
distinguished
for
public
work
of
various
kinds
many
of
them
with
beneficence
the
presence
of
such
men
could
not
conceivably
lead
to
political
difficulties
or
at
least
so
it
then
seemed
the
stories
of
persecution
that
came
through
from
eastern
europe
even
examples
of
friction
between
great
bodies
of
jews
there
and
the
natives
of
the
states
where
they
happened
to
find
themselves
were
received
in
the
west
with
disgust
as
the
aberrations
of
imperfectly
civilized
people
even
in
the
valley
of
the
rhine
where
the
jew
was
more
numerous
and
better
known
in
bulk
the
convention
of
the
more
civilized
west
was
accepted
the
doctrines
the
abstraction
of
the
french
revolution
in
this
matter
had
prevailed
here
any
reader
with
an
historical
sense
will
at
once
point
out
that
the
space
of
time
i
have
just
quoted
to
is
ridiculously
short
any
treatment
of
a
very
great
political
problem
centuries
old
which
works
for
only
sixty
years
and
then
begins
to
break
down
is
no
settlement
at
all
but
i
would
reply
that
this
period
was
especially
a
time
in
which
historical
perspective
was
lost
men
even
highly
educated
men
in
the
nineteenth
century
greatly
exaggerated
the
foreground
of
the
historical
picture
you
may
note
this
in
any
school
manual
of
the
period
where
all
the
four
centuries
of
our
roman
foundation
are
compressed
into
a
few
sentences
the
dark
ages
into
a
few
pages
the
whole
vast
story
of
the
middle
ages
themselves
into
a
few
chapters
where
the
mass
of
the
work
is
invariably
given
to
the
last
three
centuries
while
of
these
the
nineteenth
is
regarded
as
equal
in
importance
to
all
the
rest
put
together
this
false
historical
perspective
is
apparent
in
every
other
department
of
their
political
thought
for
instance
although
capitalism
huge
national
debts
the
anonymity
of
financial
action
and
the
rest
of
it
did
not
begin
to
flourish
fully
until
after
the
first
third
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
though
anyone
might
one
would
think
have
been
able
to
discover
the
exceedingly
unstable
character
of
that
society
yet
our
fathers
took
it
for
granted
as
an
eternal
state
of
things
your
victorian
man
with
in
railway
stock
thought
his
family
immutably
secure
in
a
comfortable
income
and
what
he
thought
about
capitalism
he
thought
also
about
his
anonymous
press
his
national
frontiers
his
tolerance
of
this
his
intolerance
of
that
his
parliaments
and
all
the
rest
of
it
it
is
no
wonder
if
under
such
a
false
sense
of
permanence
and
security
he
lost
historical
perspective
in
this
other
and
graver
matter
we
are
here
discussing
but
apart
from
the
argument
that
what
i
have
called
the
nineteenth
century
or
liberal
attitude
towards
the
jews
worked
well
for
its
little
day
at
least
in
western
europe
there
is
also
the
fact
that
under
special
circumstances
something
very
like
it
has
worked
well
for
much
longer
periods
in
the
past
take
for
example
the
position
of
the
jews
in
such
a
town
as
amsterdam
the
reception
of
a
jew
as
a
citizen
exactly
like
others
though
he
was
present
in
very
large
numbers
the
fiction
denying
his
separate
nationality
has
held
for
generations
in
that
community
and
it
has
procured
peace
and
apparent
contentment
upon
both
sides
and
what
is
true
to
this
day
of
amsterdam
has
been
true
in
the
past
for
long
periods
in
the
life
of
many
another
commercial
and
cosmopolitan
society
that
of
venice
notably
and
in
a
large
measure
that
of
rome
in
that
of
frankfort
of
lyons
and
of
a
hundred
cities
at
special
times
it
was
true
of
all
poland
for
generations
one
might
add
to
the
list
indefinitely
but
always
with
the
uncomfortable
knowledge
as
one
wrote
that
the
experiment
invariably
broke
down
in
the
long
run
again
there
was
to
be
advanced
for
this
liberal
attitude
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
very
powerful
argument
that
while
to
one
party
in
the
issue
the
englishman
the
frenchman
the
italian
it
seemed
well
enough
and
certainly
did
no
harm
it
was
highly
acceptable
to
the
other
the
jew
as
a
rule
not
only
accepted
but
welcomed
this
particular
way
of
dealing
with
what
at
any
rate
has
always
known
to
be
a
very
grave
problem
indeed
for
the
jew
has
a
racial
memory
beyond
all
other
men
the
arrangement
seemed
to
give
him
all
the
security
of
which
his
racial
history
a
thing
of
which
every
jew
is
acutely
conscious
had
made
him
ardently
desirous
i
think
we
should
add
though
the
phrase
would
be
quarrelled
with
by
many
modern
people
that
this
fiction
satisfied
the
jew
sense
of
for
it
is
no
small
part
of
the
problem
we
are
examining
that
the
jew
does
really
feel
such
special
treatment
to
be
his
due
without
it
he
feels
handicapped
he
is
in
his
own
view
only
saved
from
the
disadvantage
of
a
latent
hostility
when
he
is
thus
protected
and
he
is
therefore
convinced
that
the
world
owes
him
this
singular
privilege
of
full
citizenship
in
any
community
where
he
happens
for
the
moment
to
be
while
at
the
same
time
retaining
full
citizenship
in
his
own
nation
now
if
in
any
conflict
an
arrangement
seems
workable
enough
to
one
party
and
is
actually
acclaimed
by
the
other
it
is
not
lightly
to
be
disregarded
if
for
instance
a
man
and
his
tenant
quarrel
about
the
tenure
of
a
field
upon
a
very
long
lease
the
tenant
caring
little
about
nominal
ownership
but
very
much
about
his
inviolable
tenure
the
landlord
quite
agreeable
to
a
very
long
lease
but
keen
on
retaining
the
titular
ownership
that
quarrel
can
be
easily
settled
one
could
give
any
name
to
the
tenant
position
other
than
the
name
of
owner
yet
satisfy
all
his
practical
demands
a
rough
parallel
exists
between
such
a
position
and
the
attempt
at
a
settlement
which
marked
the
nineteenth
century
what
the
jew
wanted
was
not
the
proud
privilege
of
being
called
an
englishman
a
frenchman
an
italian
or
a
dutchman
to
this
he
was
completely
indifferent
for
his
pride
lay
in
being
a
jew
his
loyalty
was
to
his
own
and
what
is
more
he
might
at
any
moment
fold
up
his
tent
and
go
off
to
another
country
for
good
what
the
jew
wanted
was
not
the
feeling
that
he
was
just
like
the
others
that
would
have
been
odious
to
him
what
he
wanted
was
it
is
what
every
human
being
craves
for
and
what
he
of
all
men
most
lacked
the
power
to
feel
safe
in
the
place
where
one
happens
to
be
on
the
other
hand
his
hosts
had
not
yet
found
any
practical
inconvenience
in
granting
this
demand
they
did
not
know
the
historical
argument
against
it
or
they
thought
it
worthless
because
they
thought
the
past
barbarous
and
no
model
for
their
own
action
so
a
compromise
was
arrived
at
the
fiction
was
solidly
established
and
the
jew
though
remaining
a
jew
became
a
german
in
hamburg
a
frenchman
in
paris
an
american
in
new
york
as
he
wandered
from
place
to
place
and
for
a
long
lifetime
no
one
felt
himself
much
the
worse
for
the
false
convention
the
next
argument
in
favour
of
this
policy
was
the
fact
that
it
drew
upon
a
number
of
ideas
each
one
of
which
at
some
time
or
another
had
been
taken
for
granted
by
our
ancestors
in
each
one
of
their
numerous
but
unsuccessful
attempts
to
deal
with
the
problem
after
their
own
fashion
for
instance
a
modern
objector
says
what
rubbish
to
treat
jews
as
though
they
merely
represented
a
religion
we
all
know
they
represent
a
but
all
manner
of
legislation
in
the
past
even
in
times
and
places
where
the
difference
between
jews
and
europeans
was
most
marked
has
perpetually
fallen
back
upon
that
very
point
of
religion
alone
over
and
over
again
you
find
it
the
test
of
policy
in
early
and
again
in
fifteenth
century
spain
under
charlemagne
rule
in
gaul
in
early
mediaeval
england
at
byzantium
and
to
this
day
in
eastern
parts
where
the
jew
is
subject
to
perpetual
interference
exception
was
in
all
these
made
for
the
jew
who
abandoned
his
religion
his
nation
was
left
unmentioned
it
is
pertinent
to
quote
such
a
simple
and
recent
example
as
the
body
of
prussian
officers
now
happily
extinct
it
was
a
standing
rule
in
the
smarter
prussian
regiments
i
believe
in
nearly
all
that
no
jew
could
get
his
commission
the
prussian
system
left
the
granting
of
commissions
in
practice
to
the
existing
members
of
the
regimental
staff
they
treated
their
mess
as
a
club
and
they
blackballed
jews
but
they
would
admit
jews
and
did
so
in
considerable
numbers
was
the
jew
less
of
a
jew
in
race
through
his
baptism
throughout
all
the
centuries
that
religious
criterion
which
the
modern
reformer
cries
out
against
as
a
piece
of
humbug
and
a
mask
for
the
real
political
problem
has
been
the
criterion
taken
it
is
true
that
the
modern
solution
did
not
attempt
a
religious
segregation
on
the
contrary
the
liberal
thought
of
the
nineteenth
century
held
all
such
segregation
in
abhorrence
but
it
had
this
in
common
with
the
older
fashion
that
it
made
religion
the
point
of
interest
and
to
that
extent
masked
the
more
real
point
of
nationality
and
allegiance
lord
palmerston
making
his
famous
speech
on
the
sanctity
of
a
greek
jew
bedstead
and
insisting
that
the
said
greek
jew
was
an
english
citizen
lord
palmerston
carefully
avoiding
the
word
jew
and
pretending
throughout
his
speech
that
the
greek
jew
in
question
was
as
much
an
englishman
as
himself
was
in
a
very
different
mood
from
a
spanish
bishop
admitting
a
jew
to
office
on
condition
of
his
conversion
yet
the
two
had
this
in
common
that
neither
regarded
the
jew
as
the
member
of
another
nation
but
each
for
very
different
reasons
as
no
more
than
the
member
of
a
religion
to
palmerston
this
greek
jew
about
whose
bedstead
he
made
his
famous
speech
and
onto
whose
bedstead
hangs
to
this
day
the
phrase
civus
romanus
sum
was
above
all
a
he
may
have
seemed
to
palmerston
a
doubtful
sort
of
englishman
because
his
home
was
greece
but
he
certainly
did
not
seem
doubtful
because
he
happened
to
be
a
jew
palmerston
would
have
thought
that
only
a
matter
of
private
opinion
and
would
no
more
have
regarded
a
jew
as
an
alien
on
account
of
this
private
opinion
than
he
would
have
regarded
as
alien
a
of
the
house
of
commons
who
preferred
roast
mutton
to
boiled
take
again
another
aspect
of
the
nineteenth
century
liberal
idea
the
recognition
of
citizenship
you
have
had
that
over
and
over
again
in
the
attempted
solutions
of
the
past
it
was
the
very
essence
of
the
roman
method
for
though
the
government
of
the
roman
empire
was
much
too
concerned
with
realities
and
with
enduring
work
to
accept
any
fiction
in
the
matter
or
to
pretend
in
practice
that
the
jew
was
not
a
jew
though
on
the
contrary
the
romans
recognized
at
once
the
gulf
between
the
jews
and
themselves
and
recognized
it
not
only
by
their
cruelty
to
the
jew
but
also
by
the
privileges
they
granted
him
yet
it
was
always
their
policy
to
admit
as
the
primary
distinction
the
jew
who
could
claim
that
he
was
a
full
roman
citizen
was
in
the
eyes
of
a
roman
tribunal
much
more
important
in
that
capacity
than
in
his
social
capacity
as
jew
his
point
as
we
should
say
in
our
modern
slang
was
his
citizenship
not
his
judaism
so
i
say
this
solution
has
for
a
further
argument
the
fact
that
in
one
part
or
another
it
is
in
touch
with
the
various
attempts
our
race
has
made
in
the
past
to
solve
the
problem
there
is
yet
another
argument
strongly
in
favour
of
the
liberal
fiction
which
was
attempted
in
the
immediate
past
and
thought
to
have
been
successfully
established
it
is
the
consonance
of
that
fiction
with
the
whole
body
of
modern
custom
and
law
with
the
whole
mass
of
modern
economic
and
social
habit
we
travel
so
much
we
mix
so
much
our
economic
activities
are
at
once
so
complicated
so
interlocked
and
unhappily
for
the
most
part
so
secret
that
any
other
way
of
meeting
the
jews
would
have
seemed
at
any
rate
if
it
had
appeared
in
the
shape
of
a
positive
law
a
monstrous
anachronism
a
man
must
meet
his
friends
friends
and
treat
them
as
a
normal
part
of
the
general
society
in
which
he
moves
as
the
jew
permeated
the
society
of
the
west
everywhere
small
though
his
numbers
were
in
the
west
as
he
everywhere
intermarried
with
europeans
of
the
wealthier
class
to
insist
in
his
presence
upon
his
separate
nationality
would
have
been
odious
it
would
have
been
like
making
a
guest
feel
out
of
place
in
one
home
what
is
more
to
by
far
the
greater
part
of
the
wealthier
and
governing
classes
of
the
western
states
the
difference
of
race
was
so
far
masked
that
it
had
almost
come
to
be
forgotten
sometimes
a
shock
would
revive
it
an
english
squire
would
find
for
instance
that
a
relation
of
his
by
marriage
whose
jewish
name
and
descent
he
had
never
bothered
about
was
cousin
to
and
in
close
connection
with
a
person
of
a
totally
different
name
an
oriental
name
mixed
up
in
some
conspiracy
say
against
the
russian
state
or
he
would
learn
with
surprise
that
a
learned
university
man
with
whom
he
had
recently
dined
was
the
uncle
of
a
socialist
agitator
in
vienna
but
the
shock
would
be
a
passing
one
and
the
old
mood
of
security
would
return
with
the
growth
of
plutocracy
the
anomaly
of
treating
jews
as
individuals
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
community
increased
the
most
important
men
in
control
of
international
finance
were
admittedly
jewish
the
jew
international
position
made
him
always
useful
and
often
necessary
in
the
vast
international
economic
undertakings
of
our
time
the
anonymity
which
had
come
to
be
taken
for
granted
throughout
modern
capitalism
made
it
seem
absurd
or
impossible
always
highly
unusual
and
probably
futile
to
search
for
a
separate
jewish
element
in
any
particular
undertaking
there
is
one
last
argument
for
this
liberal
policy
which
has
a
strong
practical
value
though
it
is
exceedingly
dangerous
to
use
it
in
the
defence
of
that
policy
because
it
cuts
both
ways
it
is
the
argument
that
the
jew
ought
to
be
thus
treated
as
a
citizen
exactly
like
the
rest
and
given
no
position
either
of
privilege
or
disability
because
he
does
as
a
fact
mould
himself
so
very
rapidly
to
his
environment
when
men
say
as
they
are
beginning
to
do
that
a
jew
is
as
different
from
ourselves
as
a
chinaman
or
a
negro
or
an
esquimaux
and
ought
therefore
to
be
treated
as
belonging
to
a
separate
body
from
our
own
the
answer
is
that
the
jew
is
nothing
of
the
kind
indeed
he
becomes
after
a
short
sojourn
among
englishmen
frenchmen
germans
or
americans
so
like
his
hosts
on
the
surface
that
he
is
to
many
indistinguishable
from
them
and
that
is
one
of
the
main
facts
in
the
problem
that
is
the
real
reason
why
to
the
majority
of
the
middle
classes
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
western
countries
the
jewish
problem
was
nonexistent
were
you
to
say
it
of
any
other
race
negroes
for
instance
or
chinamen
it
would
sound
incredible
but
we
know
it
in
practice
to
be
true
that
a
jew
will
pass
his
life
in
say
three
different
communities
in
turn
in
each
the
people
who
have
met
him
will
testify
that
he
seemed
just
like
i
have
known
a
case
in
point
which
would
amuse
my
readers
but
perhaps
offend
my
jewish
readers
were
i
to
present
it
in
detail
i
shall
cite
it
therefore
without
names
because
i
desire
throughout
this
book
to
keep
to
the
rule
whereby
alone
it
can
be
of
service
that
nothing
offensive
to
either
party
shall
be
introduced
but
it
is
typical
and
can
be
matched
in
the
experience
of
many
the
case
was
that
of
the
father
of
a
man
in
english
public
life
he
began
life
with
a
german
name
in
hamburg
he
was
a
patriotic
citizen
of
that
free
city
highly
respected
and
in
every
way
a
hamburger
and
the
hamburg
men
of
that
generation
still
talk
of
him
as
one
of
themselves
he
drifted
to
paris
before
the
war
and
there
was
an
active
parisian
familiar
with
the
life
of
the
boulevards
and
full
of
energy
in
every
patriotic
and
characteristically
french
pursuit
notably
he
helped
to
recruit
men
during
the
national
catastrophe
of
everybody
who
met
him
in
this
phase
of
his
life
thought
of
him
and
talked
of
him
as
a
frenchman
deciding
that
the
future
of
france
was
doubtful
after
such
a
defeat
he
migrated
to
the
united
states
and
there
died
though
a
man
of
some
years
when
he
landed
he
soon
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
the
americans
with
whom
he
associated
to
be
an
american
just
like
themselves
he
acquired
the
american
accent
the
american
manner
the
freedom
and
the
restraints
of
that
manner
in
every
way
he
was
a
characteristic
american
in
hamburg
his
german
name
had
been
pronounced
after
the
german
fashion
in
france
where
german
names
are
common
he
retained
it
but
had
it
pronounced
in
french
fashion
on
reaching
the
united
states
it
was
changed
to
a
scotch
name
which
it
distantly
resembled
and
no
doubt
if
he
had
gone
to
japan
the
japanese
would
be
telling
us
that
they
had
known
him
as
a
worthy
japanese
gentleman
of
great
activity
in
national
affairs
and
bearing
the
honoured
name
of
an
ancient
samurai
family
the
nineteenth
century
attitude
almost
entirely
depended
upon
this
marvellous
characteristic
in
the
jews
which
differentiates
them
from
all
the
rest
of
mankind
had
that
characteristic
power
of
superficial
mutation
been
absent
the
nineteenth
century
policy
would
have
broken
down
as
completely
as
the
corresponding
northern
policy
towards
the
negro
broke
down
in
the
united
states
had
the
jew
been
as
conspicuous
among
us
as
say
a
white
man
is
among
kaffirs
the
fiction
would
have
broken
down
at
once
as
it
was
all
who
adopted
that
policy
honestly
or
dishonestly
were
supported
by
this
power
of
the
jew
to
conform
externally
to
his
temporary
surroundings
the
man
who
consciously
adopted
the
nineteenth
century
liberal
policy
towards
the
jews
as
a
mere
political
scheme
knowing
full
well
the
dangers
it
might
develop
the
man
only
half
conscious
of
the
existence
of
those
dangers
and
the
man
who
had
never
heard
of
them
but
took
it
for
granted
that
the
jew
was
a
citizen
just
like
himself
with
an
exceptional
religion
each
of
those
three
men
had
in
common
aiding
the
schemes
of
the
one
supporting
the
illusion
of
the
other
the
amazing
fact
that
a
jew
takes
on
with
inexplicable
rapidity
the
colour
of
his
environment
that
unique
characteristic
was
the
support
of
the
liberal
attitude
and
was
at
the
same
time
its
necessary
condition
the
fiction
that
a
man
of
obviously
different
type
and
culture
and
race
is
the
same
as
ourselves
may
be
practical
for
purposes
of
law
and
government
but
can
not
be
maintained
in
general
opinion
a
conspiracy
or
illusion
attempting
for
instance
to
establish
the
esquimaux
in
greenland
as
indistinguishable
from
the
danish
officials
of
the
settlement
would
fail
through
ridicule
equally
ridiculous
would
be
the
pretence
that
because
they
were
both
subjects
of
the
same
crown
an
englishman
in
the
civil
service
of
india
was
exactly
the
same
sort
of
person
as
a
sikh
soldier
but
with
the
jews
you
have
the
startling
truth
that
while
the
fundamental
difference
goes
on
the
whole
time
and
is
perhaps
deeper
than
any
other
of
the
differences
separating
mankind
into
groups
while
he
is
within
and
through
all
his
ultimate
character
above
all
things
a
jew
yet
in
the
superficial
and
most
immediately
apparent
things
he
is
clothed
in
the
very
habit
of
whatever
society
he
for
the
moment
inhabits
i
say
that
this
might
seem
to
many
the
last
and
strongest
argument
in
favour
of
the
liberal
policy
but
i
repeat
that
it
is
a
dangerous
argument
for
it
cuts
both
ways
if
a
food
which
disagrees
with
you
looks
exactly
like
another
kind
of
food
which
suits
you
you
might
use
the
likeness
as
an
argument
for
eating
either
sort
of
food
indifferently
you
might
say
it
is
silly
to
try
to
distinguish
one
must
admit
on
looking
at
them
that
they
are
the
same
thing
but
it
would
turn
out
after
dinner
a
very
bad
practical
policy
there
is
indeed
one
last
argument
which
to
me
personally
and
i
suppose
to
most
of
my
readers
is
stronger
than
all
the
rest
for
it
is
the
argument
from
morals
if
the
liberal
attitude
of
the
nineteenth
century
had
proved
a
stable
one
omitting
that
element
in
it
which
is
a
falsehood
and
therefore
a
factor
of
instability
one
could
retain
the
rest
it
would
satisfy
two
appetites
common
to
all
men
appetite
for
justice
and
the
appetite
for
charity
here
is
a
man
a
neighbour
present
in
the
midst
of
my
society
i
put
him
to
inconvenience
if
i
treat
him
as
an
alien
i
like
him
i
regard
him
as
a
friend
to
treat
such
a
man
as
though
he
were
although
a
friend
something
separate
not
to
be
admitted
to
certain
functions
of
my
community
offends
the
heart
as
it
also
offends
the
sense
of
justice
such
a
man
may
possess
a
great
talent
for
say
administration
like
all
men
possessed
of
a
great
talent
he
must
exercise
it
you
maim
him
if
you
do
not
allow
him
to
exercise
it
a
rule
forbidding
him
to
take
part
in
the
administration
of
the
society
in
which
he
finds
himself
or
even
a
feeling
hindering
him
in
such
activities
creates
not
only
in
him
but
in
those
who
are
his
hosts
a
sense
of
injustice
and
if
it
were
possible
to
adopt
a
policy
wherein
the
separate
character
of
the
jew
should
be
always
in
abeyance
so
that
he
could
be
at
the
same
time
an
englishman
and
yet
not
an
englishman
or
a
frenchman
and
yet
not
a
frenchman
then
we
should
have
a
settlement
which
all
good
men
ought
to
accept
unfortunately
that
solution
is
false
because
like
many
appeals
to
a
virtuous
instinct
it
is
sentimental
we
call
sentimental
a
policy
or
theory
which
attempts
to
reconcile
contradictions
the
sentimental
man
will
equally
abhor
crime
and
its
necessary
punishment
disorder
and
an
organized
police
he
likes
to
think
of
human
life
as
though
it
did
not
come
to
an
end
he
likes
to
read
of
the
passion
of
love
without
its
concomitant
of
sexual
conflict
he
likes
to
read
and
think
of
great
fortunes
accumulated
without
avarice
cunning
or
theft
he
likes
to
imagine
an
impossible
world
of
mutually
exclusive
things
it
makes
him
comfortable
now
we
commit
the
fault
of
the
sentimental
man
the
gravest
of
practical
faults
in
politics
when
we
cling
at
this
late
date
to
a
continuance
of
the
old
policy
you
can
not
have
your
cake
and
eat
it
too
you
can
not
at
the
same
time
have
present
in
the
world
this
ubiquitous
fluid
yet
closely
organized
jewish
community
and
the
same
each
of
the
individuals
composing
it
treated
as
though
they
were
members
of
the
nation
which
makes
them
all
they
are
you
can
not
at
the
same
time
treat
a
whole
as
one
thing
and
its
component
parts
as
another
if
you
do
you
are
building
on
contradiction
and
you
will
like
everybody
who
builds
on
contradiction
run
up
against
disaster
i
am
minded
to
give
the
reader
another
anecdote
again
taking
care
i
hope
to
suppress
all
names
and
dates
to
prevent
identification
which
might
irritate
my
jewish
readers
or
too
greatly
interest
their
opponents
as
a
younger
man
it
was
my
constant
pastime
to
linger
at
the
bar
of
the
house
of
lords
and
listen
to
what
went
on
there
i
shall
always
remember
one
occasion
when
an
aged
jew
who
had
begun
life
in
very
humble
circumstances
had
accumulated
a
great
fortune
and
had
purchased
his
peerage
like
any
other
rose
to
speak
in
connection
with
a
resolution
or
with
a
bill
dealing
with
aliens
the
hypocrisy
of
the
politician
and
the
popular
ferment
against
the
rush
of
jewish
immigrants
into
the
east
end
between
them
gave
rise
to
that
name
this
old
gentleman
very
rightly
pushed
all
such
humbug
aside
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
policy
was
aimed
at
his
people
and
he
called
them
my
people
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
the
proposed
change
would
introduce
interference
with
their
movement
and
would
subject
them
to
humiliation
he
spoke
with
flaming
patriotism
and
i
was
enthralled
by
the
intensity
vigour
and
sincerity
of
his
appeal
it
was
a
very
fine
performance
and
incidentally
considering
what
the
man
was
it
illustrated
the
vast
difference
between
his
people
and
my
own
for
a
life
devoted
to
accumulating
wealth
which
would
have
killed
nobler
instincts
in
any
one
of
us
had
evidently
seemed
to
him
quite
normal
and
left
him
with
every
appetite
of
justice
and
of
love
of
nation
unimpaired
he
clinched
that
fine
speech
with
the
cry
what
our
people
want
is
to
be
let
alone
he
said
it
over
and
over
again
i
am
sure
that
in
the
audience
which
listened
to
him
all
the
older
men
felt
a
responsive
echo
to
that
appeal
it
was
the
very
doctrine
in
which
they
had
been
brought
up
and
the
very
note
of
the
great
victorian
liberal
era
with
its
national
triumphs
in
commerce
and
in
arms
well
within
a
very
few
years
the
younger
members
of
that
very
family
came
out
in
parliamentary
scandal
after
scandal
appearing
all
in
sequence
one
after
the
other
a
sort
of
procession
they
had
been
let
alone
right
enough
but
they
had
not
let
alone
i
ask
myself
sometimes
how
would
it
sound
if
some
years
hence
any
one
of
those
descendants
having
by
that
time
been
given
his
peerage
for
they
are
rich
men
and
all
of
them
in
professional
politics
should
return
to
that
cry
of
his
ancestor
and
ask
to
be
let
alone
there
would
be
no
response
in
the
breasts
of
the
contemporaries
who
might
hear
him
manners
will
so
much
have
changed
in
this
regard
that
he
would
be
interrupted
but
i
do
not
think
that
my
hypothetical
descendant
of
that
rich
old
jew
is
likely
to
make
any
such
speech
i
think
that
when
the
time
comes
for
making
it
the
whole
idea
of
letting
alone
will
be
quite
dead
i
have
quoted
this
old
man
speech
with
no
invidious
intention
but
only
as
an
actual
example
of
the
way
in
which
the
letting
alone
of
this
great
question
breaks
down
i
am
as
familiar
as
any
jewish
reader
of
mine
with
names
that
have
dignified
public
life
in
the
past
jewish
names
jewish
peers
and
i
recall
in
particular
the
honoured
name
of
lord
herschell
to
the
friendship
between
whose
nearest
and
my
own
i
preserve
a
grateful
and
sacred
memory
but
to
return
to
the
failure
of
the
sentimental
argument
the
sentimental
argument
fails
because
it
involves
contradictions
that
is
incompatibility
of
fact
even
if
one
had
not
this
strictly
rational
principle
to
guide
one
there
is
the
whole
of
history
to
guide
one
it
is
true
that
the
pretence
of
common
citizenship
has
worked
now
for
a
shorter
now
for
a
longer
period
but
never
indefinitely
you
always
come
at
last
to
a
smash
the
jew
is
welcomed
in
mediaeval
poland
he
comes
in
vast
numbers
all
goes
well
then
the
inevitable
happens
and
the
jew
and
the
pole
stand
apart
as
enemies
each
accusing
the
other
of
injustice
the
one
crying
out
that
he
is
persecuted
the
other
that
the
state
is
in
danger
by
alien
activity
within
spain
alternatively
pursued
this
policy
and
its
opposite
the
whole
history
of
spain
the
original
seat
of
jewish
influence
in
europe
after
the
general
exile
is
a
history
of
alternating
attempts
at
the
sentimental
solution
and
a
savage
reaction
against
it
the
reaction
of
the
man
who
fighting
for
his
life
strikes
out
violently
in
terror
of
death
that
is
the
history
not
only
of
spain
but
of
every
other
country
at
one
time
or
another
indeed
we
have
before
our
very
eyes
the
beginning
of
exactly
such
a
reaction
in
the
west
of
europe
and
the
united
states
of
america
and
it
is
the
presence
of
that
reaction
which
has
caused
this
book
to
be
written
the
attempt
at
a
liberal
solution
has
already
failed
in
our
hands
if
it
had
not
failed
there
would
be
no
more
to
be
said
or
at
any
rate
we
could
postpone
the
discussion
until
the
actual
difficulty
began
but
we
have
only
to
look
around
us
to
see
that
after
these
few
years
this
one
lifetime
during
which
the
experiment
has
flourished
in
the
highest
part
of
civilization
it
is
already
breaking
down
everywhere
the
old
questions
are
being
asked
everywhere
the
old
complaints
are
being
raised
everywhere
the
old
perils
are
reappearing
we
must
seek
some
solution
for
if
we
fail
to
find
it
we
know
from
the
past
what
tragedies
are
in
store
for
us
both
there
is
a
problem
a
most
direct
and
urgent
problem
once
it
is
recognized
a
solution
of
it
is
necessarily
demanded
but
it
is
not
enough
to
show
that
the
mere
denial
of
the
existence
of
that
problem
the
old
nineteenth
century
liberal
policy
was
false
and
bound
to
break
down
it
is
just
as
necessary
if
we
appreciate
how
practical
and
immediate
the
problem
is
to
state
it
and
illustrate
it
from
contemporary
events
it
is
not
enough
to
show
that
the
attempted
liberal
policy
has
failed
one
must
also
before
trying
to
discover
a
solution
analyse
the
nature
of
the
problem
as
it
presents
itself
at
the
moment
and
that
is
what
i
propose
to
do
in
the
next
chapter
the
present
phase
of
the
problem
chapter
iii
the
present
phase
of
the
problem
i
said
in
my
last
that
the
old
solution
of
ignoring
or
denying
the
jewish
problem
was
bound
to
break
down
and
had
broken
down
and
this
was
tantamount
to
saying
that
the
problem
persists
but
i
said
one
must
go
farther
and
state
the
full
nature
of
that
problem
as
it
stands
at
this
moment
before
one
could
attempt
a
practical
solution
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
a
person
who
imagines
himself
immortal
and
immune
from
disease
is
as
a
fact
dangerously
ill
and
that
the
of
his
health
has
disproved
his
theory
one
must
go
on
to
find
out
exactly
what
is
the
matter
with
him
and
if
possible
what
the
cure
for
the
trouble
may
be
the
jewish
problem
in
its
larger
sense
i
have
defined
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
and
that
as
i
think
every
one
defines
it
including
all
the
many
jews
who
have
discussed
the
matter
it
is
the
presence
within
one
political
organism
of
another
political
organism
at
friction
with
it
the
strains
set
up
by
such
an
unnatural
state
of
affairs
the
risk
of
disaster
to
the
lesser
body
and
of
hurt
to
both
if
it
remain
unremedied
the
true
solution
therefore
is
only
to
be
discovered
in
some
policy
which
will
permanently
relieve
the
strain
and
normal
relations
the
end
of
such
a
solution
should
be
the
functioning
as
far
as
possible
of
both
parties
at
their
ease
and
without
disturbance
one
to
the
other
but
this
general
statement
of
the
problem
that
it
is
the
presence
to
each
party
of
an
alien
body
and
the
consequent
irritation
and
friction
on
each
is
not
enough
we
must
pursue
it
more
closely
and
develop
it
in
greater
detail
describing
how
the
friction
and
the
irritation
are
increasing
insisting
that
they
have
even
become
a
menace
then
only
can
we
set
out
to
discover
as
far
as
possible
by
analysis
what
exact
character
the
disease
bears
and
why
it
is
of
this
character
only
after
all
this
can
we
explore
a
remedy
when
we
look
round
the
modern
world
say
the
last
twenty
years
we
discover
in
widely
separate
places
and
among
very
different
interests
and
inhabiting
the
most
diverse
characters
the
presence
of
what
is
for
many
a
new
political
feeling
it
runs
from
irritation
to
exasperation
from
grumbling
to
invective
it
is
everywhere
directed
against
the
jews
one
activity
after
another
in
which
the
jews
are
variously
in
the
right
or
in
the
wrong
or
indifferent
has
aroused
hostility
in
varying
degrees
but
increasing
and
though
the
are
still
as
i
have
said
dissociated
in
the
main
yet
they
are
beginning
to
coalesce
and
to
form
large
areas
inimical
to
israel
it
is
objected
of
the
jew
in
finance
in
industry
in
commerce
where
he
is
ubiquitous
and
powerful
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
numbers
that
he
seeks
and
has
already
almost
reached
dominion
it
is
objected
that
he
acts
everywhere
against
the
interests
of
his
hosts
that
these
are
being
interfered
with
guided
run
against
their
will
that
a
power
is
present
which
acts
either
with
indifference
to
what
we
love
or
in
active
opposition
to
what
we
love
notably
is
it
said
to
be
indifferent
to
or
in
active
opposition
against
our
national
feelings
our
religious
traditions
and
the
general
culture
and
morals
of
christendom
which
we
have
inherited
and
desire
to
preserve
that
power
is
israel
these
feelings
grew
as
one
example
after
another
of
the
jewish
strength
the
jewish
cohesion
arrived
to
feed
them
how
violent
they
were
to
become
might
be
seen
by
taking
as
a
special
example
their
extreme
form
called
when
we
come
later
in
this
book
to
examine
that
modern
phenomenon
we
shall
find
it
to
be
not
only
a
proof
of
the
insistence
and
gravity
of
the
problem
we
are
trying
to
solve
but
also
some
explanation
of
its
nature
upon
a
world
thus
already
exasperated
and
in
some
large
sections
exasperated
to
the
point
of
unreason
for
the
drive
was
and
is
full
of
unreason
there
suddenly
fell
the
double
effect
of
the
bolshevist
revolution
a
revolution
which
struck
both
at
the
benevolent
who
would
hear
no
harm
of
the
jews
and
those
who
had
hitherto
shielded
or
obeyed
them
as
identified
only
with
the
interests
of
large
capital
it
was
a
blow
in
flank
under
which
staggered
both
the
supporters
of
jewish
neutrality
and
the
dependants
upon
jewish
finance
the
old
liberal
policy
still
officially
held
the
field
but
when
this
shattering
explosion
came
it
compelled
attention
bolshevism
stated
the
jewish
problem
with
a
violence
and
an
insistence
such
that
it
could
no
longer
be
denied
either
by
the
blindest
fanatic
or
the
most
resolute
liar
such
was
in
its
largest
lines
the
recent
historical
sequence
leading
up
to
the
state
of
affairs
we
now
find
let
us
trace
that
sequence
in
more
detail
and
from
a
little
farther
back
a
lifetime
ago
when
the
liberal
policy
was
founded
and
when
conditions
were
favourable
to
its
establishment
the
populace
might
still
nourish
its
traditional
antagonism
to
the
jew
but
in
the
west
of
europe
his
numbers
were
very
limited
only
a
few
thousand
in
france
and
england
combined
and
hardly
as
many
in
italy
he
belonged
for
the
most
part
to
the
classes
that
did
not
come
into
direct
competition
with
the
poor
of
the
large
towns
from
the
countrysides
he
was
absent
he
had
not
attempted
to
govern
his
hosts
as
a
politician
nor
in
any
large
measure
to
indoctrinate
them
through
the
press
the
rapid
decline
of
religion
at
that
time
broke
down
one
barrier
and
the
transformation
of
the
governing
classes
from
the
old
territorial
lords
to
the
modern
plutocracy
broke
down
another
the
convention
that
the
jew
was
indistinguishable
from
the
citizens
of
the
country
in
which
he
happened
to
live
or
at
any
rate
from
that
in
which
he
had
last
lived
was
further
fostered
by
the
of
that
cosmopolitan
aristocratic
society
which
had
marked
the
eighteenth
century
and
which
could
note
and
register
the
movements
of
prominent
individuals
from
nation
to
nation
the
new
industrial
fortunes
and
the
new
international
finance
both
contributed
to
the
same
end
while
the
jew
also
began
to
compete
successfully
in
every
one
of
the
liberal
professions
without
as
yet
dominating
any
of
them
no
conflicts
had
arisen
between
the
jewish
race
and
the
national
interests
of
any
european
people
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
poles
and
these
were
subject
and
silenced
throughout
all
this
time
from
the
years
after
waterloo
to
the
years
immediately
succeeding
the
defeat
of
the
french
in
the
weight
and
position
of
the
jew
in
western
civilization
increased
out
of
all
knowledge
and
yet
without
shock
and
almost
without
attracting
attention
they
entered
the
parliaments
everywhere
the
english
peerage
as
well
and
the
universities
in
very
large
numbers
a
jew
became
prime
minister
of
great
britain
another
a
principal
leader
of
the
italian
resurrection
another
led
the
opposition
to
napoleon
iii
they
were
present
in
increasing
numbers
in
the
chief
institutions
of
every
country
they
began
to
take
positions
as
fellows
of
every
important
oxford
and
cambridge
college
they
counted
heavily
in
the
national
literatures
browning
and
arnold
families
for
instance
in
england
mazzini
in
italy
they
came
for
the
first
time
into
european
diplomacy
the
armies
and
navies
alone
were
as
yet
untouched
by
their
influence
strains
of
them
were
even
present
in
the
reigning
families
the
institution
of
freemasonry
with
which
they
are
so
closely
allied
and
all
the
ritual
of
which
is
jewish
in
character
increased
very
rapidly
and
very
greatly
the
growth
of
an
anonymous
press
and
of
an
increasingly
anonymous
commercial
system
further
extended
their
power
it
is
an
illusion
to
believe
that
all
this
great
change
was
jewish
in
origin
the
jew
did
not
create
it
he
floated
upon
it
but
it
worked
manifestly
to
his
advantage
and
we
find
him
at
the
end
of
it
represented
on
the
governing
institutions
of
western
europe
fifty
or
one
hundredfold
more
than
was
his
due
in
proportion
to
his
numbers
the
jews
intermarried
everywhere
with
the
leading
families
and
before
any
sign
that
a
turn
of
the
tide
had
taken
place
they
had
already
achieved
that
position
in
which
they
are
now
being
assailed
and
to
oust
them
from
which
such
strong
efforts
are
preparing
perhaps
the
first
event
which
cut
across
this
unbroken
ascent
was
the
defeat
of
the
french
in
not
that
its
effects
were
immediate
in
this
field
but
that
a
nation
defeated
is
the
more
likely
to
raise
a
grievance
real
or
imaginary
in
seeking
a
cause
for
social
misfortunes
following
on
its
military
disasters
it
will
naturally
fix
upon
an
international
rather
than
a
national
one
and
blame
its
alien
population
rather
than
its
own
moreover
the
date
of
the
french
defeat
was
also
the
date
on
which
was
overthrown
the
temporal
power
of
the
papacy
in
this
also
the
jews
had
played
their
part
it
gave
them
the
opportunity
to
play
a
still
greater
part
in
the
immediate
future
of
the
new
italy
within
a
few
years
rome
was
to
see
a
jewish
mayor
who
supported
with
all
his
might
the
unchristianizing
of
the
city
and
especially
of
its
educational
system
one
small
but
significant
factor
in
the
whole
business
of
these
and
early
the
beginning
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
rise
to
monopoly
of
the
jewish
international
news
agents
among
which
reuters
was
prominent
and
the
presence
of
jews
as
international
correspondents
of
the
various
great
newspapers
the
most
prominent
example
being
opper
a
bohemian
jew
who
concealed
his
origin
under
the
false
name
of
de
blowitz
and
for
years
acted
as
paris
correspondent
for
a
paper
in
those
days
of
international
influence
the
first
expression
of
the
reaction
that
was
at
hand
was
to
be
found
in
sundry
definitely
writings
appearing
in
germany
and
france
most
noticeable
in
the
latter
country
their
effect
was
at
first
slight
though
they
had
the
high
advantage
of
extensive
documentation
the
great
majority
of
educated
men
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
passed
such
things
by
as
the
extravagancies
of
fanatics
but
these
fanatics
none
the
less
laid
the
foundation
of
future
action
by
the
quotation
of
an
immense
quantity
of
facts
which
could
not
but
remain
in
the
mind
even
of
those
who
were
most
contemptuous
of
the
new
propaganda
in
these
books
special
insistence
was
laid
upon
exposing
what
the
jews
themselves
call
that
is
the
presence
everywhere
throughout
western
europe
of
men
in
important
public
positions
who
passed
for
english
french
or
what
not
but
were
really
jews
in
many
cases
i
have
already
quoted
the
poet
browning
and
the
distinguished
family
of
arnold
these
people
were
not
hiding
their
religion
but
had
simply
drifted
from
the
original
jewish
community
of
which
their
ancestors
had
been
members
but
in
most
others
there
was
more
or
less
present
an
element
of
conscious
secrecy
it
was
evidently
the
object
of
those
who
produced
the
literature
i
am
describing
to
attack
that
secrecy
in
particular
and
to
undo
its
effects
and
as
i
have
said
even
where
their
fanaticism
was
most
ridiculed
the
vast
array
of
facts
which
they
marshalled
could
not
be
without
its
effect
upon
the
memory
of
their
contemporaries
there
next
appeared
a
series
of
direct
international
actions
undertaken
by
jewish
finance
the
most
important
of
which
of
course
was
the
drawing
of
egypt
into
the
european
system
and
particularly
into
the
system
of
great
britain
of
more
effect
upon
public
opinion
was
the
excitement
of
the
dreyfus
case
in
france
and
immediately
afterwards
of
the
south
african
war
in
england
the
characteristic
of
the
dreyfus
case
was
not
the
discussion
upon
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
unfortunate
man
from
whom
it
takes
its
title
but
the
immense
international
clamour
with
which
it
was
surrounded
this
local
affair
was
made
an
affair
of
the
whole
world
and
men
took
as
passionate
an
interest
in
it
in
the
remotest
corners
of
civilization
as
though
they
had
been
the
principals
actually
engaged
such
a
phenomenon
could
not
but
astonish
the
mass
of
onlookers
who
had
hitherto
not
given
the
jewish
question
a
thought
and
when
there
was
added
to
it
the
great
ordeal
of
the
south
african
war
openly
and
undeniably
provoked
and
promoted
by
jewish
interests
in
south
africa
when
that
war
was
so
unexpectedly
prolonged
and
proved
so
unexpectedly
costly
in
blood
and
treasure
a
second
element
was
added
to
the
growing
feeling
not
yet
indeed
of
antagonism
to
jewish
power
half
cultured
france
was
dreyfusard
and
much
more
than
half
england
favoured
the
boer
war
at
its
origin
but
of
interest
in
the
jewish
question
of
curiosity
on
the
part
of
the
average
citizen
who
had
not
hitherto
heard
of
it
the
original
minority
which
had
begun
to
oppose
jewish
power
with
their
extreme
left
wing
of
and
their
core
of
men
whose
quarrel
was
rather
with
the
financial
control
of
the
modern
world
than
with
any
racial
problem
tended
to
grow
as
always
happens
with
a
growing
movement
events
appeared
to
suit
themselves
to
that
growth
and
to
promote
it
the
panama
scandals
in
the
french
parliament
had
already
fed
the
movement
in
france
the
later
parliamentary
scandals
in
england
marconi
and
the
rest
afforded
so
astonishing
a
parallel
to
panama
that
the
similarity
was
of
universal
comment
they
might
have
passed
as
isolated
things
a
generation
before
they
were
now
connected
often
unjustly
with
the
uneasy
sense
of
a
general
financial
conspiracy
they
were
at
any
rate
connected
with
an
atmosphere
essentially
jewish
in
character
meanwhile
there
had
already
begun
one
of
those
great
migratory
movements
of
the
jews
which
have
diversified
history
for
two
thousand
years
and
which
are
almost
always
the
prelude
to
each
new
disturbance
in
the
equilibrium
of
the
jews
and
each
new
resuscitation
of
the
jewish
problem
in
its
most
acute
form
the
great
reservoir
of
the
jewish
race
was
of
course
that
country
of
poland
which
had
so
nobly
succoured
the
jews
during
the
persecutions
of
the
late
middle
ages
poland
had
made
itself
an
asylum
for
all
the
jews
who
cared
to
go
to
it
and
was
now
after
the
infamous
partition
inaugurated
by
prussia
still
the
home
of
something
like
half
the
jews
of
the
world
the
hatred
of
the
jews
entertained
by
all
classes
of
russians
the
persecutions
they
suffered
from
the
fact
that
russia
since
the
partition
governed
that
part
of
poland
where
they
were
most
numerous
started
the
new
exodus
the
movement
was
a
westerly
one
mainly
to
the
united
states
but
there
also
arose
in
connection
with
it
a
novel
growth
of
great
ghettoes
in
the
english
industrial
towns
more
particularly
in
london
while
new
york
was
slowly
transformed
from
a
city
as
free
of
jewish
population
as
london
and
paris
had
been
in
the
past
to
one
in
which
a
good
third
or
more
of
its
inhabitants
became
either
entirely
jewish
or
partly
jewish
this
vast
immigration
which
was
in
full
swing
just
before
the
outbreak
of
the
great
war
and
which
was
adding
so
active
a
leaven
to
the
increasing
ferment
which
had
even
planted
the
beginnings
of
a
ghetto
in
paris
and
which
was
affecting
the
whole
of
the
west
was
supplemented
by
one
more
factor
of
the
first
importance
modern
capitalism
by
which
the
jew
had
so
largely
benefited
but
which
he
did
not
originate
and
in
which
prominent
though
few
jewish
names
were
so
immixed
had
for
its
counterpart
and
reaction
the
movement
this
again
the
jews
did
not
originate
nor
at
first
direct
but
it
rapidly
fell
more
and
more
under
their
control
the
family
of
mordecai
who
had
assumed
the
name
of
marx
produced
in
karl
a
most
powerful
exponent
of
that
theory
though
he
did
no
more
than
copy
and
follow
his
instructors
especially
louis
blanc
a
of
genius
he
presented
in
complete
form
the
full
theory
of
socialism
economic
social
and
by
implication
religious
for
he
postulated
materialism
after
karl
marx
came
a
crowd
of
his
compatriots
who
led
the
industrial
proletariat
in
rebellion
against
the
increasing
power
of
the
capitalist
system
and
began
to
organize
a
determined
revolt
before
the
great
war
one
could
say
that
the
whole
of
the
socialist
movement
so
far
as
its
staff
and
direction
were
concerned
was
jewish
and
while
it
took
this
purely
economic
form
in
the
west
in
the
east
in
the
russian
empire
it
took
a
political
form
as
well
and
the
growing
revolutionary
force
in
that
empire
was
equally
jewish
in
direction
and
driving
power
such
was
the
situation
on
the
eve
of
the
great
war
men
were
beginning
to
be
thoroughly
alive
to
what
was
meant
by
the
jewish
problem
the
old
security
was
dispelled
for
ever
but
as
yet
only
a
minority
though
now
a
large
one
was
prepared
to
deal
with
that
problem
and
to
discuss
it
openly
all
that
was
official
and
particularly
the
press
with
its
vast
influence
had
as
yet
refused
in
any
department
to
face
the
realities
of
the
position
the
convention
forbidding
public
allusion
to
the
jewish
question
was
still
very
strong
on
the
surface
it
seemed
as
though
the
old
liberal
policy
still
stood
firm
and
indeed
unshakeable
the
jews
were
in
every
place
of
they
taught
in
the
universities
of
all
europe
they
were
everywhere
in
the
press
everywhere
in
finance
they
were
continually
to
be
found
in
the
highest
places
of
government
and
in
the
chanceries
of
christendom
they
had
acquired
a
dominant
power
which
none
could
question
but
the
challenge
against
this
unnatural
position
necessarily
worked
against
great
odds
it
remained
private
and
had
great
difficulty
in
finding
expression
none
the
less
it
extended
and
by
had
become
serious
the
immeasurable
catastrophe
of
the
war
with
which
the
jews
had
nothing
to
do
and
which
their
more
important
financial
representatives
did
all
they
could
to
prevent
fell
upon
europe
it
seemed
at
first
as
though
in
the
face
of
that
overwhelming
tragedy
what
had
been
so
rapidly
growing
i
mean
the
debate
and
conflict
upon
jewish
claims
would
be
silenced
the
jews
were
found
fighting
gallantly
in
all
the
armies
their
services
were
generously
acknowledged
though
the
cruel
ambiguity
of
their
situation
was
hardly
realized
considering
that
they
had
no
national
interest
in
the
fight
it
must
have
seemed
to
them
a
mere
insanity
crucifying
their
nation
to
no
purpose
for
zangwill
put
the
matter
well
indeed
when
he
said
that
those
who
eagerly
and
spontaneously
joined
the
first
recruiting
and
these
were
numerous
did
so
for
the
honour
of
israel
the
sacrifice
was
not
without
fruit
in
its
presence
many
a
complaint
was
silenced
and
much
was
revealed
which
but
for
it
would
have
remained
unprobed
the
christian
family
in
its
bereavement
saw
at
its
side
a
jewish
neighbour
who
had
lost
his
son
in
what
was
no
concern
of
his
race
the
christian
priest
witnessed
the
agony
of
the
young
jewish
soldier
the
defender
of
the
western
nations
saw
at
his
side
not
only
the
jewish
conscript
who
should
never
have
been
called
but
the
jewish
volunteer
thus
the
first
to
enlist
from
the
united
states
was
a
jew
later
promoted
whom
i
had
the
pleasure
and
honour
of
meeting
on
mangin
staff
at
mayence
i
hope
he
may
see
these
lines
it
looked
as
though
in
the
presence
of
such
a
suffering
which
the
jews
shared
with
us
the
growing
quarrel
between
them
and
ourselves
would
be
appeased
men
who
had
been
prominent
not
only
for
their
discussion
of
the
jewish
problem
but
for
their
direct
and
open
antagonism
to
jewish
power
and
even
to
the
most
legitimate
of
jewish
claims
were
now
compelled
to
silence
reconciliation
was
in
the
air
when
in
the
very
heat
of
the
struggle
came
that
factor
incalculably
important
which
now
rules
all
the
rest
i
mean
the
factor
of
what
is
called
this
new
jewish
movement
changed
the
whole
face
of
things
and
coming
on
the
top
of
the
rest
has
transformed
the
problem
for
all
our
generation
henceforth
it
was
to
be
discussed
quite
openly
henceforth
it
could
only
become
more
and
more
the
chief
problem
of
politics
and
give
rise
to
that
menacing
situation
upon
a
solution
of
which
depends
the
security
of
our
future
for
the
bolshevist
movement
or
rather
explosion
was
jewish
that
truth
may
be
so
easily
confused
with
a
falsehood
that
i
must
at
the
outset
make
it
exact
and
clear
the
bolshevist
movement
was
jewish
movement
but
not
a
movement
of
the
jewish
race
as
a
whole
most
jews
were
quite
extraneous
to
it
very
many
indeed
and
those
of
the
most
typical
abhor
it
many
actively
combat
it
the
imputation
of
its
evils
to
the
jews
as
a
whole
is
a
grave
injustice
and
proceeds
from
a
confusion
of
thought
whereof
i
at
any
rate
am
free
with
so
much
said
let
me
return
to
the
affair
what
is
called
labour
that
is
the
direction
of
the
proletarian
revolt
against
capitalist
conditions
had
as
we
have
seen
been
directed
in
the
main
by
the
jew
his
energy
his
international
quality
his
devotion
to
a
set
scheme
prevailed
all
this
was
not
peculiar
to
russia
but
present
throughout
the
industrialized
areas
of
the
west
by
the
word
directed
i
do
not
mean
any
conscious
plan
i
mean
that
the
jews
with
their
perpetual
movement
from
country
to
country
with
their
natural
indifference
to
national
feeling
as
a
force
counteracting
class
feeling
with
their
lucid
thought
and
their
passion
for
deduction
with
their
tenacity
and
intellectual
industry
had
naturally
become
the
chief
exponents
and
the
most
able
leaders
they
formed
above
all
the
cement
binding
the
movement
together
throughout
the
world
it
was
they
more
than
any
others
who
insisted
on
a
solution
upon
the
lines
which
their
compatriot
karl
marx
had
copied
from
his
greater
european
contemporaries
and
made
definite
in
his
famous
book
on
capital
but
there
was
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
this
intellectual
leadership
this
organization
of
socialism
by
jews
socialism
still
remained
a
mere
and
the
control
and
actual
management
of
it
in
a
great
state
when
it
passed
from
theory
to
practice
the
words
social
revolution
were
still
but
words
in
and
men
did
not
take
them
too
seriously
but
when
in
a
socialist
revolution
was
accomplished
suddenly
at
one
blow
in
one
great
state
and
when
its
agents
directors
and
masters
were
seen
to
be
a
close
corporation
of
jews
with
only
a
few
each
of
these
controlled
by
the
jews
through
one
influence
or
another
it
was
quite
another
matter
the
thing
had
become
actual
the
menace
to
national
traditions
and
to
the
whole
christian
ethic
of
property
was
immediate
more
important
than
all
so
far
as
the
jewish
problem
is
concerned
many
who
had
remained
silent
upon
it
on
account
of
convention
avarice
or
fear
were
now
compelled
to
speak
from
that
moment
in
early
it
became
the
chief
political
problem
of
our
time
coincident
with
intimately
mixed
with
but
in
all
its
implications
superior
to
the
great
economic
quarrel
on
to
which
it
was
now
grafted
the
story
may
be
briefly
told
the
russian
state
for
modern
war
had
passed
during
the
end
of
the
year
through
a
strain
which
it
had
found
intolerable
russian
society
after
the
mortal
losses
sustained
was
upon
the
eve
of
dissolution
and
the
formidable
revolutionary
movement
which
had
for
years
left
its
direction
and
organization
in
jewish
hands
broke
out
for
the
third
time
in
our
generation
but
this
time
successfully
after
rapidly
accelerating
phases
it
settled
into
the
situation
which
has
endured
from
the
early
part
of
to
the
present
day
in
the
towns
the
parliament
was
repudiated
and
a
dictatorship
of
the
proletariat
was
declared
the
workshops
were
in
future
to
be
run
by
committees
in
the
russian
soviets
and
similar
organizations
were
to
control
agriculture
in
the
villages
where
the
peasants
had
already
seized
the
land
and
were
streaming
back
from
the
dissolved
armies
to
their
homes
in
practice
of
course
what
was
set
up
was
no
proletarian
government
still
less
anything
so
impossible
and
contradictory
in
terms
as
a
dictatorship
of
proletarians
the
thing
was
called
the
republic
of
the
workmen
and
peasants
it
was
in
fact
nothing
of
the
sort
it
was
the
pure
despotism
of
a
clique
the
leaders
of
which
had
been
specially
launched
upon
russia
under
german
direction
in
order
to
break
down
any
chance
of
a
revival
of
russian
military
power
and
all
those
leaders
without
exception
were
jews
or
held
by
the
jews
through
their
domestic
relations
and
all
that
followed
was
done
directly
under
the
orders
of
jews
the
most
prominent
of
whom
was
one
braunstein
who
disguised
himself
under
the
assumed
name
of
trotsky
a
terror
was
set
up
under
which
were
massacred
innumerable
russians
of
the
governing
classes
so
that
the
whole
framework
of
the
russian
state
disappeared
among
these
of
course
must
specially
be
noted
great
numbers
of
the
clergy
against
whom
the
jewish
revolutionaries
had
a
particular
grudge
a
clean
sweep
was
made
of
all
the
old
social
organization
and
under
the
despotism
of
this
jewish
clique
the
old
economic
order
was
reversed
food
and
all
necessities
were
controlled
in
the
towns
and
rationed
the
manual
labourer
receiving
the
largest
share
and
none
any
share
unless
he
worked
at
the
orders
of
the
new
masters
the
agricultural
land
was
in
theory
nationalized
but
in
practice
the
jewish
committees
of
the
towns
were
unable
to
enforce
their
rule
over
it
and
it
reverted
to
the
natural
condition
of
peasant
ownership
but
the
jewish
committees
of
the
towns
were
strong
enough
to
raid
great
areas
of
agricultural
production
for
the
support
of
themselves
and
their
troops
and
of
their
dependants
in
the
cities
who
had
come
close
to
starvation
through
the
breakdown
of
the
social
system
what
followed
later
is
of
common
knowledge
the
attempts
at
led
by
scattered
russians
and
other
military
leaders
all
failed
because
the
peasants
believed
that
their
farms
were
at
stake
and
eagerly
volunteered
to
defend
them
the
greatly
increased
misery
of
the
towns
the
slow
decline
of
industrial
production
in
spite
of
the
most
rigid
despotism
enforcing
conscript
labour
and
the
general
deliquescence
of
society
if
the
motives
of
the
men
who
thus
brought
the
whole
of
a
christian
state
into
ruins
within
a
few
weeks
were
analysed
we
should
it
is
to
be
presumed
discover
something
of
this
sort
their
main
motive
was
the
pursuit
of
the
political
and
economic
ideals
of
which
they
were
the
spokesmen
and
which
already
so
many
of
their
compatriots
the
jews
throughout
the
rest
of
europe
had
espoused
communism
so
far
as
property
was
concerned
the
marxian
doctrine
of
socialist
production
and
distribution
the
socialist
doctrine
imposed
by
arbitrary
and
despotic
arrangements
favouring
those
who
had
in
the
past
been
least
favoured
in
this
economic
and
political
group
of
motives
the
leading
motive
was
probably
enough
the
doctrine
of
communism
in
which
these
men
for
the
most
part
sincerely
believed
to
this
must
be
added
an
equally
sincere
hatred
of
national
feeling
save
of
course
where
the
jewish
nation
was
concerned
the
conception
of
a
russian
national
feeling
seemed
to
these
new
leaders
ridiculous
as
indeed
the
conception
of
a
national
feeling
must
seem
ridiculous
to
their
compatriots
everywhere
or
if
not
ridiculous
subsidiary
to
the
more
important
motives
of
individual
advantage
and
to
the
righting
of
such
immediate
wrongs
as
the
individual
may
feel
the
christian
religion
they
naturally
attacked
for
it
was
abhorrent
to
their
social
theory
they
also
had
a
certain
crusading
or
propagandist
ideal
running
through
the
whole
of
their
action
the
desire
to
spread
communism
far
beyond
the
boundaries
of
what
had
once
been
the
russian
state
it
is
this
which
has
led
them
to
intrigue
throughout
central
and
even
in
western
europe
in
favour
of
revolution
though
these
were
the
main
motives
other
motives
must
also
have
been
present
it
is
impossible
that
committees
consisting
of
jews
and
suddenly
finding
themselves
thus
in
control
of
such
new
powers
should
not
have
desired
to
benefit
their
fellows
it
is
equally
impossible
that
they
should
have
forgone
a
sentiment
of
revenge
against
that
which
had
persecuted
their
people
in
the
past
they
can
not
but
in
the
destroying
of
russia
have
mixed
with
a
desire
to
advantage
the
individual
russian
poor
the
desire
to
take
vengeance
upon
the
national
tradition
as
a
whole
it
has
even
been
said
but
denied
and
i
know
not
where
the
truth
lies
that
jews
were
among
those
guilty
of
the
worst
incident
which
we
now
know
in
all
its
revolting
details
the
murder
of
the
russian
royal
family
father
mother
and
girls
and
the
unfortunate
sickly
heir
the
only
boy
further
it
is
impossible
with
jewish
committees
thus
in
control
of
the
russian
treasury
and
of
russian
means
of
communication
that
they
should
not
have
had
some
sympathy
with
their
compatriots
who
were
so
largely
in
control
of
western
finance
however
sincere
their
detestation
of
capitalism
for
probably
in
most
of
them
the
opinion
is
held
sincerely
enough
it
is
in
the
nature
of
things
that
one
of
their
blood
and
kind
should
however
misguided
they
may
think
him
appeal
to
them
more
than
one
of
ours
and
it
is
this
which
explains
the
half
alliance
which
you
find
throughout
the
world
between
the
jewish
financiers
on
the
one
hand
and
the
jewish
control
of
the
russian
revolution
on
the
other
it
is
this
which
explains
the
of
the
defence
against
bolshevism
the
perpetual
commercial
protest
the
continued
negotiations
the
recognition
of
the
soviet
by
our
politicians
the
clamour
of
labour
in
favour
of
german
jewish
industrialism
and
against
poland
all
that
has
taken
place
wherever
jewish
finance
is
powerful
particularly
at
westminster
but
be
this
as
it
may
the
tremendous
explosion
which
we
call
bolshevism
brought
the
discussion
of
the
jewish
problem
to
a
head
the
two
forces
which
had
hitherto
held
back
the
discussion
of
that
problem
were
that
liberal
fiction
which
had
ruled
for
more
than
a
generation
according
to
which
it
was
indecent
even
to
mention
the
word
jew
or
to
suggest
that
there
was
any
difference
between
the
jew
and
those
who
harboured
him
and
secondly
the
fact
that
the
jews
were
erroneously
regarded
by
most
of
the
people
in
the
west
that
is
by
most
of
those
who
had
the
control
of
the
press
and
therefore
of
all
public
expression
as
so
controlling
wealth
that
they
were
at
once
the
natural
guardians
of
property
and
so
placed
that
an
attack
upon
them
jeopardized
the
wealth
of
the
critic
the
man
who
had
gone
into
the
city
or
who
had
his
life
spent
upon
the
bourse
in
paris
or
who
was
negotiating
any
great
capitalist
enterprise
who
had
to
do
in
whatever
capacity
with
the
running
of
the
great
banks
or
with
the
international
means
of
communication
by
sea
and
land
even
the
man
who
got
his
precarious
living
by
writing
each
and
all
had
hitherto
felt
that
a
public
silence
upon
the
jewish
problem
was
necessary
to
his
private
welfare
those
who
recognized
the
gravity
of
the
problem
had
hitherto
been
moved
by
fear
to
be
silent
upon
it
at
least
in
public
though
in
private
they
were
often
voluble
enough
those
who
recognized
it
in
a
lesser
degree
had
also
been
affected
by
the
same
fear
lastly
you
had
the
large
class
who
were
under
no
necessity
for
restraint
whether
from
fear
or
any
other
cause
but
who
were
quite
content
to
leave
things
as
they
were
so
long
as
they
received
their
regular
salary
or
dividends
and
who
were
profoundly
convinced
that
any
interference
with
the
jew
would
imperil
those
dividends
or
that
salary
the
jewish
bolshevist
movement
put
an
end
to
that
state
of
mind
the
people
who
had
hitherto
been
silent
through
avarice
convention
or
fear
now
found
themselves
between
an
upper
and
a
nether
millstone
hitherto
they
had
at
least
believed
that
to
keep
silence
was
to
secure
or
to
advance
their
economic
position
now
they
found
suddenly
risen
upon
the
flank
of
that
position
a
new
and
formidable
jewish
force
determined
upon
the
destruction
of
property
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
to
keep
silent
there
was
a
growing
need
to
speak
and
though
the
old
habit
the
old
secrecy
was
still
strong
upon
them
the
necessity
for
combating
jewish
bolshevism
was
stronger
still
all
over
europe
the
jewish
character
of
the
movement
became
more
and
more
apparent
the
leaders
of
communism
everywhere
proclaimed
that
truth
by
adopting
the
asinine
policy
of
pretending
that
the
revolution
was
russian
and
national
they
attempted
far
too
late
to
hide
the
jewish
origins
of
its
creators
and
directors
and
made
a
childish
effort
to
pretend
that
the
russian
names
so
innocently
put
forward
were
genuine
when
the
real
names
were
upon
every
tongue
yet
at
the
same
time
they
were
receiving
money
and
securities
of
the
victims
through
jewish
agents
jewels
stripped
from
the
dead
or
rifled
from
the
strong
boxes
of
murdered
men
and
women
in
one
specific
instance
the
promise
of
a
subsidy
to
a
communist
paper
in
london
was
traced
to
this
source
it
was
proved
that
the
englishman
involved
was
a
mere
puppet
and
that
the
jewish
connections
of
the
family
through
marriage
were
the
true
agents
in
the
transaction
in
another
a
trade
deputation
was
pompously
announced
under
russian
names
which
turned
out
upon
inspection
to
consist
as
to
its
first
member
of
a
man
engaged
all
his
life
in
the
service
of
a
jewish
firm
as
to
the
other
of
a
jew
who
was
actually
the
of
braunstein
the
diplomatic
agent
nominated
and
partially
accepted
by
the
british
government
to
represent
the
new
authority
of
the
russian
towns
was
again
a
jew
finkelstein
the
nephew
by
marriage
of
a
prominent
jew
in
this
country
he
passed
under
the
name
of
litvinoff
so
it
was
throughout
the
whole
movement
in
every
capital
and
in
every
great
industrial
town
we
must
not
neglect
the
very
obvious
truth
that
in
all
this
there
was
ample
fuel
for
the
flame
the
industrial
proletariat
throughout
the
world
was
equally
disgusted
and
equally
ready
for
revolt
the
leadership
of
the
movement
may
be
jewish
but
its
current
was
not
created
by
the
jew
to
imagine
that
is
to
fall
into
the
most
childish
errors
of
the
the
stream
of
influence
arose
from
the
sufferings
and
the
burning
sense
of
injustice
which
industrial
capitalism
had
imposed
on
the
dispossessed
mass
of
wage
earners
they
were
and
are
naturally
indifferent
as
to
whether
those
whom
they
hope
may
be
their
saviours
come
from
palestine
muscovy
or
timbuctoo
they
are
interested
in
economic
freedom
in
the
doctrine
of
socialism
and
in
its
results
not
in
the
personality
of
those
who
guide
them
their
position
is
comprehensible
enough
but
my
point
is
that
the
directing
minority
of
western
european
capitalism
which
had
hitherto
been
silent
upon
the
jewish
problems
from
the
motives
i
have
described
were
now
released
they
were
free
to
speak
their
mind
and
began
to
speak
it
the
volume
of
their
protest
can
not
but
increase
the
cat
as
the
expression
goes
is
out
of
the
bag
or
to
put
it
in
more
dignified
language
the
debate
will
now
never
more
be
silenced
it
is
admitted
that
the
revolutionary
leadership
is
mainly
jewish
it
is
recognized
as
clearly
now
as
it
has
long
been
recognized
that
international
finance
was
mainly
jewish
and
even
those
who
would
tolerate
silence
upon
the
one
peril
will
certainly
not
tolerate
it
upon
the
other
the
danger
is
indeed
not
over
the
debate
will
take
place
that
is
no
peril
but
a
good
the
danger
is
rather
that
as
restraint
is
gradually
removed
the
natural
antagonism
to
the
jewish
race
felt
by
nearly
all
those
who
are
not
of
it
and
among
whom
it
lives
may
take
an
irrational
and
violent
form
and
that
we
may
be
upon
the
brink
of
yet
one
more
of
those
catastrophes
of
those
tragedies
of
those
disasters
which
have
marked
the
history
of
israel
in
the
past
to
avert
this
to
discover
some
solution
of
the
problem
while
there
is
yet
time
to
prevent
deeds
which
would
bring
us
to
shame
and
that
small
minority
among
us
to
suffering
should
be
the
object
of
every
honest
man
the
general
causes
of
friction
chapter
iv
the
general
cause
of
friction
the
immediate
cause
of
the
new
gravity
apparent
in
the
jewish
problem
is
the
revolution
in
russia
the
completely
new
feature
of
open
discussion
now
attaching
to
it
a
thing
which
would
have
seemed
incredible
in
england
twenty
years
ago
is
the
leadership
the
jews
have
assumed
in
the
economic
quarrel
of
the
proletariat
against
capitalism
most
people
therefore
on
being
asked
the
cause
of
friction
between
the
jews
and
their
hosts
at
this
moment
will
reply
in
england
at
least
that
it
lies
in
the
propaganda
now
running
loose
throughout
industrial
europe
our
quarrel
with
the
jews
you
will
hear
from
a
hundred
different
sources
is
that
they
are
conspiring
against
christian
civilization
and
in
particular
against
our
own
country
under
the
form
of
social
revolutionaries
such
a
reply
though
it
is
the
almost
universal
reply
of
the
moment
in
this
country
is
most
imperfect
the
friction
between
the
jews
and
the
nations
among
which
they
are
dispersed
is
far
older
far
more
profound
far
more
universal
for
a
whole
generation
before
the
present
crisis
arose
the
comparatively
small
number
of
men
who
were
hammering
away
steadily
at
the
jewish
problem
trying
to
provoke
its
discussion
and
insisting
on
its
importance
were
mainly
concerned
with
quite
another
aspect
of
jewish
activity
the
aspect
of
international
finance
as
controlled
by
jews
before
that
aspect
had
assumed
its
modern
gravity
the
reproach
against
the
jews
was
that
their
international
position
warred
against
our
racial
traditions
and
our
patriotisms
before
that
again
there
had
been
the
reproach
of
a
different
religion
and
particularly
of
their
antagonism
to
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
and
all
that
flowed
from
that
doctrine
and
there
had
been
even
before
that
great
quarrel
the
reproach
that
they
were
bad
citizens
within
the
pagan
roman
empire
perpetually
in
rebellion
against
it
and
guilty
of
massacring
other
roman
citizens
in
another
civilization
than
ours
in
that
of
islam
another
set
of
reproaches
had
arisen
or
rather
another
species
of
contempt
and
oppression
after
long
periods
of
peace
there
would
come
in
particular
regions
the
most
violent
oppression
within
the
last
few
years
for
instance
a
jew
in
morocco
was
treated
as
though
he
was
hardly
human
he
had
to
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
when
any
magnate
was
passing
by
he
had
to
dress
in
a
particular
manner
to
mark
him
off
as
something
degraded
among
his
he
might
not
ride
through
the
gate
of
a
town
but
had
to
dismount
there
were
twenty
actions
normal
to
civic
life
in
the
moroccan
city
which
were
forbidden
to
the
jew
all
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
friction
between
the
jews
and
those
among
whom
they
live
is
always
present
and
has
always
been
present
now
latent
now
rising
furiously
to
the
surface
now
grumbling
through
long
periods
of
uncertain
peace
now
boiling
over
in
all
the
evils
of
persecution
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
this
friction
between
jew
and
while
finding
different
excuses
for
its
action
on
different
occasions
has
been
a
force
permanently
at
work
everywhere
and
at
all
times
what
is
the
cause
of
it
what
is
its
nature
the
matter
is
very
difficult
to
approach
because
we
are
not
dealing
with
things
susceptible
of
positive
proof
you
can
prove
from
historical
record
that
the
thing
has
existed
you
can
show
its
terrible
effects
ceaselessly
recurrent
throughout
all
our
history
but
it
is
another
matter
to
analyse
the
unseen
forces
which
produce
it
and
any
such
analysis
can
be
no
more
than
an
attempt
i
take
it
that
the
causes
of
this
friction
with
all
its
lamentable
results
are
of
two
kinds
there
are
first
causes
for
it
by
which
i
mean
those
causes
which
are
always
present
and
are
ineradicable
their
effort
may
be
summed
up
in
the
truth
that
the
whole
texture
of
the
jewish
nation
their
corporate
tradition
their
social
mind
is
at
issue
with
the
people
among
whom
they
live
there
are
next
special
causes
by
which
i
mean
social
actions
and
expressions
which
lead
to
friction
and
could
be
modified
the
two
chief
of
which
are
the
use
of
secrecy
by
the
jews
as
a
method
of
action
and
the
open
expression
of
superiority
over
his
neighbours
which
the
jew
can
not
help
feeling
but
is
wrong
to
emphasize
i
will
deal
with
these
in
their
order
and
first
consider
the
general
causes
though
i
must
admit
at
the
outset
that
a
mere
summary
of
them
is
no
sufficient
explanation
of
the
phenomenon
there
would
seem
to
be
something
more
profound
and
even
more
mysterious
about
it
for
it
will
be
universally
conceded
that
while
the
closest
intimacy
and
respect
is
possible
between
individuals
of
the
two
opposing
races
the
moment
you
come
to
great
groups
and
especially
to
the
popular
instinct
in
the
matter
the
gravest
friction
is
apparent
it
is
an
issue
too
deep
than
to
be
accounted
for
by
mere
differences
of
temper
it
is
as
though
there
were
some
inward
force
filling
men
on
either
side
not
indeed
with
necessary
hostility
it
is
against
any
such
necessity
that
all
this
book
is
written
but
certainly
with
conflicting
ends
it
is
first
to
be
noted
that
most
of
the
accusations
made
against
the
jews
by
their
enemies
and
most
of
the
very
proper
rebuttals
of
those
accusations
advanced
by
the
jews
and
their
defenders
miss
the
mark
because
they
attempt
to
put
in
abstract
form
what
is
really
something
highly
concrete
and
this
is
equally
true
of
the
praise
bestowed
upon
the
jews
of
the
special
virtues
ascribed
to
them
and
of
the
denials
of
these
virtues
they
miss
the
mark
because
they
attempt
to
express
in
terms
of
one
category
what
should
be
expressed
in
terms
of
another
they
are
doing
what
a
man
does
when
he
compares
two
pictures
by
their
outline
while
in
point
of
fact
their
interest
lies
in
colour
or
when
he
affirms
something
of
a
tune
the
fundamental
point
of
which
something
is
not
the
air
at
all
but
the
instruments
upon
which
it
is
played
as
who
should
say
that
god
save
the
king
was
shrill
because
he
heard
it
played
on
a
penny
whistle
or
booming
because
he
heard
it
played
on
a
violoncello
the
real
point
to
note
is
not
that
the
jews
appear
to
us
or
we
to
them
to
possess
certain
abstract
qualities
and
defects
but
that
in
their
case
each
quality
or
defect
has
a
special
character
a
special
national
which
it
lacks
in
ours
thus
you
will
hear
the
jews
arraigned
by
their
enemies
for
three
such
vices
as
cowardice
avarice
and
treason
to
take
three
of
the
commonest
accusations
you
examine
their
actions
and
you
find
innumerable
instances
of
the
highest
courage
the
greatest
generosity
and
the
most
devoted
loyalty
but
courage
generosity
and
loyalty
of
a
jewish
kind
directed
to
jewish
ends
and
stamped
with
a
highly
distinctive
jewish
mark
the
man
who
accuses
the
jews
of
cowardice
means
that
they
do
not
enjoy
a
fight
of
his
kind
nor
a
fight
fought
after
his
fashion
all
he
has
discovered
is
that
the
courage
is
not
shown
under
the
same
circumstances
nor
for
the
same
ends
nor
in
the
same
mode
but
if
the
word
courage
means
anything
he
can
not
on
reflection
deny
it
to
actions
of
which
one
could
make
an
endless
catalogue
even
from
contemporary
experience
alone
is
it
cowardice
in
a
young
man
to
sacrifice
his
life
deliberately
for
the
sake
of
his
own
people
did
that
young
jew
show
cowardice
who
killed
the
russian
prime
minister
the
antagonist
of
his
people
after
the
first
revolution
following
on
the
war
was
it
cowardice
to
walk
up
in
a
crowded
theatre
surrounded
by
all
the
enemies
of
his
race
and
shoot
their
chief
in
their
midst
is
it
cowardice
to
stand
up
against
the
vast
alien
majority
and
to
do
so
over
and
over
again
perhaps
through
a
whole
lifetime
insisting
on
things
that
are
grossly
unpopular
with
that
majority
and
running
a
risk
the
whole
time
of
physical
violence
you
find
jews
adopting
that
attitude
all
over
europe
can
one
think
it
is
cowardice
which
has
permitted
the
individuals
of
this
nation
to
maintain
their
tradition
unbroken
through
two
thousand
years
of
intermittent
torture
spoliation
and
violent
death
the
thing
so
stated
is
ridiculous
and
it
is
clear
that
those
who
make
such
an
accusation
are
confounding
their
own
form
of
courage
with
courage
as
a
universal
attribute
they
think
that
because
jews
show
courage
under
other
circumstances
and
in
another
way
from
themselves
corresponding
to
another
appetite
as
it
were
therefore
it
is
no
longer
courage
to
think
like
that
is
to
confess
yourself
very
limited
i
can
testify
myself
to
any
number
of
courageous
acts
which
i
have
seen
performed
by
jews
i
am
not
alluding
to
acts
of
courage
in
warfare
of
which
there
is
ample
evidence
but
to
acts
of
a
sort
in
which
our
race
would
not
have
shown
the
same
quality
or
of
courage
i
will
cite
one
case
rather
more
than
twenty
years
ago
when
feeling
on
the
dreyfus
case
was
at
its
height
and
when
the
feeling
of
the
french
army
in
particular
was
at
white
heat
i
happened
to
be
in
the
town
of
nîmes
through
which
at
the
time
a
body
of
troops
was
passing
the
café
in
which
i
sat
was
filled
with
young
sergeants
there
were
hardly
any
civilians
present
beside
myself
there
came
into
the
place
an
elderly
jew
very
short
in
stature
highly
marked
with
the
physical
characteristics
of
his
race
an
unmistakable
jew
he
was
somewhat
bent
under
the
weight
of
his
years
with
fiery
eyes
and
a
singularly
vibrating
intonation
of
voice
he
was
selling
broadsheets
of
the
most
violent
kind
all
of
them
insults
against
the
army
he
came
into
this
café
with
the
sheets
in
his
hand
so
that
all
could
see
the
large
capital
letters
of
the
headlines
and
slowly
went
round
the
assembly
ironically
offering
them
to
the
lads
in
uniform
with
their
swords
at
their
side
for
they
were
of
the
cavalry
every
one
knows
the
french
temper
on
such
occasions
a
complete
silence
which
may
at
any
moment
be
transformed
into
something
very
different
one
sergeant
after
another
politely
waved
him
aside
and
passed
him
on
he
went
round
the
whole
lot
of
them
gazing
into
their
faces
with
his
piercing
eyes
wearing
the
whole
time
an
ironical
smile
of
insult
describing
at
intervals
the
nature
of
his
goods
and
when
he
had
done
that
he
went
out
unharmed
it
was
an
astonishing
sight
i
have
seen
many
others
as
astonishing
and
as
vivid
but
for
courage
i
have
never
seen
it
surpassed
here
was
a
man
old
and
feeble
the
member
of
a
very
small
minority
which
he
knew
to
be
hated
and
particularly
hated
by
the
people
whom
he
challenged
because
he
held
one
of
his
own
people
to
be
injured
he
took
this
tremendous
risk
and
went
through
this
task
with
a
sort
of
pleasure
in
that
risk
you
may
call
it
insolence
offensiveness
what
you
will
but
you
can
not
deny
it
the
title
of
courage
it
was
courage
of
the
very
highest
quality
i
repeat
you
may
see
evidence
of
that
sort
of
courage
in
jewish
action
throughout
the
world
and
in
every
age
you
have
the
beginning
of
it
in
the
siege
of
jerusalem
if
the
fear
which
we
now
all
entertain
should
unhappily
prove
well
founded
we
shall
see
it
again
upon
the
same
scale
take
avarice
when
the
jew
is
accused
of
avarice
by
his
enemies
they
are
reading
into
him
that
vice
in
a
form
of
which
know
themselves
capable
which
themselves
practise
which
fully
understand
but
which
never
practises
in
their
fashion
the
jew
is
adventurous
with
his
money
he
is
a
speculator
a
trader
he
is
also
a
man
who
thinks
of
it
in
exact
terms
he
is
never
romantic
about
it
but
he
is
almost
invariably
generous
in
the
use
of
it
our
race
when
it
yields
to
the
vice
of
avarice
is
close
secretive
uncharitable
he
is
pitiless
and
sly
in
accumulation
he
is
vociferous
in
his
insistence
upon
the
exact
terms
of
an
agreed
compact
he
is
also
tenacious
in
the
pursuit
of
anything
which
he
has
set
out
on
the
accumulation
of
money
among
the
rest
he
is
almost
fanatical
in
his
appetite
for
success
in
whatever
he
has
undertaken
the
accumulation
of
money
among
the
rest
but
to
say
that
the
money
once
accumulated
is
not
generously
used
is
nonsense
there
is
not
one
of
us
who
could
not
cite
at
once
a
dozen
examples
of
jewish
generosity
upon
a
scale
which
makes
us
ashamed
nor
is
it
true
to
say
that
this
generosity
has
ostentation
for
its
root
or
as
it
is
called
ransome
either
though
a
love
of
magnificence
is
certainly
a
great
passion
in
the
jewish
character
it
does
not
account
for
the
most
of
his
generosity
it
is
a
generosity
which
extends
to
all
manner
of
private
relations
and
if
you
will
take
the
testimony
of
those
who
have
been
in
the
service
of
the
jews
and
are
not
jews
themselves
that
testimony
is
almost
universally
in
favour
of
their
employers
if
those
employers
be
men
of
large
means
they
will
tell
you
that
they
felt
humiliated
in
serving
a
jew
that
the
relations
were
never
easy
that
there
was
always
distance
but
not
often
that
they
were
treated
meanly
just
the
other
way
there
has
usually
been
present
a
generosity
the
same
argument
applies
to
the
cry
of
ransome
it
is
true
that
some
of
the
more
scandalous
jewish
fortunes
have
thrown
up
defences
against
public
anger
by
the
return
of
a
small
proportion
in
the
shape
of
public
endowments
it
is
an
action
and
a
motive
not
peculiar
to
them
but
that
does
not
explain
the
mass
of
private
and
unheard
benefaction
to
which
we
can
all
testify
and
which
is
as
common
with
the
jew
as
with
the
wealthy
it
is
here
as
in
the
matter
of
courage
a
question
of
those
of
our
people
who
happen
to
be
generous
they
are
rare
do
not
calculate
they
often
forget
or
confuse
the
sums
they
have
made
away
with
as
though
it
were
mere
extravagance
the
jew
knows
the
exact
extent
of
his
sacrifice
its
proportion
to
his
total
means
is
he
then
less
generous
by
no
means
he
is
in
scale
generous
but
in
a
different
fashion
it
might
be
argued
that
this
generosity
of
the
jew
is
a
consequence
of
the
way
in
which
he
regards
money
it
comes
and
goes
with
him
because
he
is
a
speculator
and
a
wanderer
it
has
been
said
that
no
great
jewish
fortune
is
ever
permanent
that
none
of
these
millionaires
ever
founded
a
family
this
is
not
quite
true
but
it
is
true
that
considering
the
long
list
of
great
jewish
fortunes
which
have
marked
the
whole
progress
of
our
civilization
it
is
astonishing
how
few
have
taken
root
but
though
this
conception
of
money
may
be
an
element
in
the
generosity
of
the
jew
it
does
not
fully
explain
it
and
at
any
rate
that
generosity
is
there
and
contradicts
flatly
the
accusation
of
avarice
indeed
the
general
accusation
of
avarice
fails
and
is
why
it
is
a
sort
of
standing
jest
permitted
even
where
the
jews
are
most
powerful
it
is
a
jest
they
themselves
do
not
resent
because
they
know
it
to
be
beside
the
mark
the
accusation
of
treason
is
on
the
same
footing
save
that
it
is
even
more
to
one
side
than
the
others
quoted
there
is
no
race
which
has
produced
so
few
traitors
it
is
not
treason
in
the
jew
to
be
international
it
is
not
treason
in
the
jew
to
work
now
for
one
interest
among
those
who
are
not
of
his
people
now
for
another
he
can
only
be
charged
with
treason
when
he
acts
against
the
interests
of
israel
and
there
is
no
nation
nor
ever
has
been
one
in
which
the
national
solidarity
was
greater
or
national
weakness
in
the
shape
of
traitors
less
indeed
that
is
the
very
accusation
their
enemies
make
against
them
that
they
are
too
homogeneous
that
they
hold
too
much
together
and
are
too
fierce
in
and
you
can
not
have
that
accusation
coupled
with
an
accusation
of
treason
what
is
true
is
that
the
jew
lends
himself
to
one
group
in
its
action
against
another
he
will
serve
france
against
the
germans
or
the
germans
against
france
and
he
will
do
so
indifferently
as
a
resident
in
the
country
he
benefits
or
the
country
he
wounds
for
he
is
indifferent
to
either
the
moment
war
breaks
out
the
intelligence
departments
of
both
sides
rely
upon
the
jew
and
they
rely
upon
him
not
only
on
account
of
his
indifference
to
nationalism
but
also
on
account
of
his
many
languages
his
travel
the
presence
of
his
relations
in
the
enemy
country
and
this
is
true
not
only
of
war
but
of
armed
peace
but
it
is
clear
that
in
all
this
there
are
examples
of
what
would
be
treason
in
him
such
actions
are
not
treasons
for
he
does
not
betray
israel
but
they
all
have
an
atmosphere
repellent
to
us
they
are
things
which
if
we
did
them
or
when
we
do
them
degrade
us
they
do
not
degrade
the
jew
one
might
continue
the
list
of
such
accusations
indefinitely
and
in
every
one
you
would
find
that
the
root
of
the
quarrel
is
not
the
presence
of
a
particular
defect
but
the
presence
of
a
difference
in
circumstances
temperament
character
a
different
colour
and
taste
in
the
quality
or
defect
concerned
it
is
which
offends
it
is
which
causes
the
misunderstandings
and
which
leads
to
the
tragedies
while
this
is
true
of
the
accusations
made
against
the
jewish
people
it
is
unfortunately
equally
true
of
the
corresponding
qualities
which
they
and
their
defenders
advance
in
the
rebuttal
the
jew
is
essentially
patriotic
that
is
true
but
not
patriotic
to
our
ends
or
in
our
way
he
is
essentially
but
not
to
our
ends
or
in
our
way
a
personal
obligation
which
he
can
not
meet
a
personal
and
intimate
contract
in
which
he
may
default
especially
to
one
of
his
own
people
is
abhorrent
to
the
jew
but
not
in
our
way
he
has
not
our
shame
of
bankruptcy
for
instance
but
much
more
than
our
shame
of
personal
borrowing
drunkenness
a
vice
most
offensive
to
human
dignity
is
with
him
the
rarest
vice
with
us
the
commonest
but
our
sense
of
dignity
in
repose
he
has
not
nor
does
he
feel
our
sense
of
injured
dignity
in
mummery
his
tenacity
which
all
know
and
all
in
a
sense
admire
and
which
is
far
superior
to
our
own
is
also
a
narrower
tenacity
or
at
any
rate
a
tenacity
of
a
different
kind
he
will
follow
one
end
where
we
will
follow
many
his
wonderful
loyalty
to
all
family
relations
we
know
but
we
do
not
appreciate
it
because
it
is
outside
our
own
circle
even
his
intellectual
gifts
which
are
less
affected
by
this
matter
of
have
something
alien
to
us
in
them
they
are
undeniable
but
we
feel
them
to
be
used
for
other
ends
than
ours
they
are
coldly
used
when
ours
are
used
enthusiastically
they
are
used
with
intensity
when
we
use
them
with
carelessness
if
we
leave
the
controversial
field
and
concern
ourselves
with
an
appreciation
of
jewish
qualities
apart
from
our
like
or
dislike
of
them
and
apart
from
their
difference
in
intimate
texture
as
it
were
from
our
own
they
may
be
summarized
i
think
as
follows
the
jew
concentrates
upon
one
matter
he
does
not
disperse
his
mind
and
this
concentration
carries
with
it
strength
and
weakness
it
has
been
said
in
connection
with
it
all
such
terms
are
metaphorical
that
his
mind
is
not
elastic
but
this
is
a
great
element
in
his
success
i
have
noticed
that
the
jew
having
once
taken
up
a
particular
task
shows
an
indifference
to
other
tasks
which
from
our
standpoint
is
marvellous
how
many
instances
could
not
one
cite
of
two
jewish
brothers
the
one
occupied
in
finance
the
other
in
science
or
the
one
in
politics
the
other
in
music
and
how
clearly
do
we
see
in
those
instances
the
complete
indifference
of
the
jew
to
things
outside
the
province
he
has
undertaken
how
remarkable
in
our
eyes
is
his
resistance
to
any
temptation
which
might
lead
him
away
from
his
end
the
jew
who
is
devoted
to
science
for
instance
remains
completely
indifferent
to
its
opportunities
for
enrichment
the
jew
who
is
devoted
to
philosophy
and
what
great
names
he
can
show
in
this
sphere
throughout
the
centuries
lives
in
poverty
and
is
perfectly
content
so
to
live
the
jew
devoted
to
any
particular
ideal
of
social
change
devotes
himself
entirely
to
that
and
ends
his
task
often
more
powerful
hardly
ever
more
wealthy
nearly
always
much
poorer
than
when
he
began
it
above
all
he
refuses
to
be
distracted
for
a
moment
from
his
goal
another
character
which
is
affiliated
to
this
first
leading
character
of
the
jew
would
seem
to
be
the
lucidity
of
his
thought
the
jew
argument
is
never
muddled
that
is
one
of
his
prime
assets
not
only
in
all
discussion
but
in
all
action
it
is
also
if
a
cause
of
strength
a
cause
of
the
enmity
he
arouses
or
to
use
my
milder
term
of
the
friction
for
an
exactly
constructed
process
of
reasoning
from
which
there
is
no
escape
has
in
it
for
those
less
capable
of
it
something
of
the
bully
a
man
may
feel
the
conclusion
to
be
false
perhaps
he
it
to
be
false
he
lacks
the
power
to
express
his
reasons
he
may
not
know
how
to
state
the
principles
which
his
adversary
has
left
out
of
account
or
when
to
bring
them
into
discussion
and
he
feels
the
iron
logic
offered
to
him
like
a
pistol
presented
at
the
head
of
his
better
judgment
but
for
strength
and
for
weakness
also
lucidity
is
the
mark
of
the
mind
he
carries
that
lucidity
into
the
smallest
details
of
whatever
he
may
perform
one
must
add
to
all
this
a
certain
intensity
of
action
which
is
very
noticeable
and
which
again
is
a
cause
of
friction
between
himself
and
those
about
him
hear
a
jew
speaking
especially
a
jew
speaking
upon
the
revolutionary
platform
and
note
the
at
which
the
current
is
working
the
energy
which
he
uses
is
not
the
energy
of
a
large
flame
but
of
a
a
stream
of
heat
he
is
wholly
absorbed
not
in
his
own
expression
but
in
actively
penetrating
the
mind
of
his
hearers
and
here
again
is
that
difference
in
quality
to
which
i
have
alluded
one
might
say
indifferently
that
the
jew
is
never
eloquent
or
that
he
is
always
eloquent
when
he
speaks
upon
things
that
possess
his
soul
he
is
not
eloquent
in
our
fashion
but
he
is
at
any
rate
astonishingly
effective
in
his
own
the
jew
has
this
other
characteristic
which
has
become
increasingly
noticeable
in
our
own
time
but
which
is
probably
as
old
as
the
race
and
that
is
a
corporate
capacity
for
hiding
or
for
advertising
at
will
a
power
of
pushing
whatever
the
whole
race
desires
advanced
or
of
suppressing
what
the
whole
race
desires
to
suppress
and
this
also
however
legitimately
used
is
a
cause
of
friction
men
get
the
feeling
of
a
swarm
in
the
presence
of
such
action
they
also
get
the
feeling
of
being
tricked
and
it
breeds
bad
blood
in
the
aspect
of
the
deliberate
use
of
secrecy
i
shall
deal
with
this
character
in
my
next
chapter
for
i
think
in
that
aspect
it
is
a
particular
cause
of
friction
which
can
be
eliminated
but
the
general
capacity
and
instinct
of
the
jew
for
corporate
action
in
the
booming
of
what
he
wants
boomed
and
the
soft
pedalling
of
what
he
wants
soft
pedalled
is
ineradicable
it
will
always
remain
a
permanent
irritant
in
its
effect
upon
those
to
whom
it
is
applied
the
best
proof
of
it
is
that
after
the
most
violent
boom
after
the
talents
of
some
particular
jew
or
the
scientific
discovery
of
another
or
the
misfortunes
of
another
or
the
miscarriage
of
justice
against
another
has
been
shouted
at
us
pointed
and
iterated
until
we
are
all
deafened
there
comes
an
inevitable
reaction
and
the
same
men
who
were
half
hypnotized
into
the
desired
mood
are
nauseated
with
it
and
refuse
a
repetition
of
the
dose
the
converse
is
true
men
who
find
that
some
important
matter
has
been
suppressed
some
bad
scandal
in
the
state
or
some
trick
in
commerce
because
jewry
desired
it
to
be
suppressed
are
soon
on
the
alert
they
will
not
suffer
the
operation
as
quietly
the
second
time
as
they
did
the
first
indeed
they
tend
if
anything
to
grow
too
suspicious
anyhow
in
both
cases
this
ineradicable
racial
habit
a
cause
perhaps
of
jewish
survival
and
certainly
an
element
of
jewish
strength
is
also
a
cause
of
acute
friction
between
them
and
us
but
a
mere
category
of
this
kind
is
as
i
have
said
useless
to
explain
the
fundamental
quality
the
hidden
root
of
the
ceaseless
conflict
between
the
very
soul
of
the
jew
and
the
soul
of
the
society
around
him
all
these
points
are
but
manifestations
of
some
profound
some
subterranean
power
for
contrast
the
value
of
which
we
can
not
grasp
but
the
effects
of
which
are
only
too
apparent
and
there
remains
in
the
minds
of
those
who
most
rely
upon
this
race
and
of
those
who
most
suspect
them
the
sense
of
an
impassable
gulf
between
them
and
ourselves
it
is
the
recognition
the
admission
of
such
a
contrast
the
telling
of
the
truth
about
it
the
working
upon
it
as
a
necessary
condition
which
must
form
the
foundation
for
any
solution
at
which
we
can
arrive
there
is
one
feature
in
the
european
attitude
towards
the
jews
which
must
be
specially
dealt
with
and
that
is
the
false
impression
that
the
friction
between
us
and
them
is
in
the
main
a
quarrel
with
their
wealth
that
impression
has
been
greatly
weakened
by
the
recent
revolutionary
activity
of
the
jew
surging
up
from
the
depths
appearing
upon
the
surface
and
producing
the
great
upheaval
in
russia
and
the
attempted
upheavals
elsewhere
but
though
the
new
jewish
revolutionary
movement
has
shaken
the
old
insistence
on
jewish
wealth
it
is
hard
to
eradicate
it
it
has
been
present
throughout
the
ages
and
will
remain
at
the
back
of
people
minds
perhaps
for
ever
because
the
few
jews
who
do
concentrate
on
piling
up
great
fortunes
concentrate
on
that
task
so
entirely
yet
the
impression
is
false
and
is
the
fruitful
cause
of
the
worst
misunderstandings
for
the
jews
are
not
a
rich
nation
and
the
very
fact
that
they
stand
in
the
popular
mind
and
especially
in
the
mind
of
rich
people
in
times
of
corruption
for
wealth
is
an
example
of
the
way
in
which
they
are
misunderstood
and
of
the
way
in
which
injustice
to
the
jew
arises
the
jews
are
a
poor
nation
an
enemy
would
say
that
they
were
poor
because
they
did
not
work
but
this
again
would
be
an
injustice
because
the
jew
works
exceedingly
hard
and
has
often
in
the
past
and
does
still
in
many
places
work
hard
not
only
in
negotiation
and
commerce
but
with
his
hands
we
see
the
jews
in
the
middle
ages
monopolizing
important
manual
occupations
in
some
districts
dyeing
and
shipbuilding
for
instance
and
there
are
many
parts
of
eastern
europe
where
they
work
upon
the
land
the
jews
are
a
poor
nation
because
they
are
an
alien
nation
and
because
their
activities
are
for
the
most
part
condemned
to
working
against
the
grain
in
a
society
which
is
not
their
own
but
that
they
a
poor
nation
is
not
only
true
but
abundantly
evident
to
any
one
who
has
travelled
and
watched
their
various
settlements
with
any
sympathy
now
that
they
have
arrived
in
such
great
numbers
in
the
west
people
are
beginning
to
appreciate
this
we
have
already
seen
how
a
lifetime
ago
when
the
jews
of
the
west
i
mean
especially
in
france
and
england
and
america
were
a
small
number
of
merchants
and
financiers
the
great
wealth
of
a
very
small
number
among
them
was
not
counterbalanced
in
our
experience
by
the
exceeding
poverty
of
the
mass
but
we
can
see
for
ourselves
how
true
it
is
that
once
you
get
below
the
exceptional
fortunes
and
a
comparatively
small
the
jewish
nation
is
no
more
than
millions
of
exceedingly
poor
families
those
who
have
watched
them
outside
the
west
those
who
have
seen
them
in
their
great
eastern
communities
where
the
bulk
of
the
race
still
resides
in
the
marches
of
russia
will
abundantly
agree
it
helps
us
to
understand
the
jewish
problem
if
we
grasp
the
fact
that
a
great
part
of
the
jewish
complaint
against
us
is
precisely
this
poverty
to
which
the
bulk
of
the
jews
are
condemned
it
is
all
very
well
to
sneer
at
the
jewish
complaint
of
persecution
and
oppression
and
to
cite
ironically
whenever
it
arises
the
immense
fortunes
of
a
few
families
like
the
rothschilds
and
the
sassoons
the
monds
the
samuels
and
the
rest
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
average
jew
that
is
not
the
way
the
thing
looks
at
all
what
he
notices
and
notices
rightly
is
that
he
has
no
part
in
that
solid
permanent
inherited
wealth
which
is
the
mark
of
a
healthy
european
community
further
a
most
important
point
already
touched
on
in
passing
these
great
fortunes
are
ephemeral
in
the
european
nations
you
have
a
mass
of
great
fortunes
far
larger
in
number
and
even
in
total
than
the
jewish
financial
fortunes
but
those
great
fortunes
have
been
in
the
past
and
are
still
wherever
our
society
is
healthy
permanent
they
run
through
european
history
in
the
shape
of
the
great
families
in
the
shape
of
the
the
great
territorial
families
in
this
country
have
been
wealthy
for
centuries
and
remain
in
established
wealth
and
the
same
is
in
the
main
true
of
the
great
italian
families
it
is
obviously
true
of
the
great
german
families
and
in
spite
of
the
great
changes
of
the
last
century
and
a
half
it
is
still
largely
true
of
the
old
french
families
it
is
not
true
of
the
jewish
families
the
vast
jewish
fortunes
which
have
marked
history
rise
suddenly
and
melt
again
almost
as
suddenly
a
jew
will
begin
in
some
very
small
way
as
a
pawnbroker
in
liverpool
for
instance
or
a
very
small
bookseller
in
frankfort
you
will
find
his
son
a
great
banker
his
grandson
so
wealthy
as
to
command
politics
for
a
generation
and
then
if
you
will
watch
the
process
in
the
past
to
take
a
modern
unfinished
instance
is
of
course
misleading
last
and
soon
the
name
disappears
again
and
disappears
for
whom
have
you
representing
the
few
great
jewish
fortunes
of
the
early
middle
ages
in
england
they
were
all
ruined
before
the
end
of
the
thirteenth
century
whom
have
you
representing
the
later
great
jewish
fortunes
on
the
rhine
the
fortunes
of
the
sixteenth
century
and
the
early
seventeenth
they
have
utterly
gone
who
have
you
left
representing
the
considerable
jewish
houses
of
medieval
venice
of
genoa
of
rome
the
causes
of
this
rapid
fluctuation
are
many
they
all
attach
to
the
peculiar
position
as
well
as
to
the
peculiar
character
of
the
jew
we
find
them
partly
in
the
passion
for
speculation
which
the
jewish
intelligence
naturally
harbours
we
find
them
still
more
i
think
in
the
instinctive
opposition
to
the
jew
which
his
alien
surroundings
perpetually
arouse
it
is
however
important
to
remember
this
last
point
from
our
point
of
view
the
jew
when
he
does
get
rich
seems
to
get
much
too
rich
and
to
get
rich
much
too
quickly
and
he
exercises
far
too
much
power
through
his
wealth
for
we
think
of
him
the
whole
time
as
an
alien
with
no
right
to
any
position
but
the
jew
sees
it
in
a
very
different
light
in
his
point
of
view
his
effort
to
accumulate
wealth
is
always
heavily
handicapped
when
he
succeeds
he
only
succeeds
through
his
own
tenacity
and
the
patriotic
of
his
fellows
and
he
always
holds
his
wealth
on
an
insecure
tenure
what
looks
to
us
like
the
breakdown
of
a
jewish
fortune
through
speculation
seems
to
the
jew
the
fatal
recurrent
result
of
unending
opposition
in
connection
with
the
illusion
of
a
wealthy
jewish
race
you
have
of
course
the
matter
which
i
briefly
mentioned
above
the
connection
between
our
wealthier
and
therefore
governing
classes
and
the
jewish
wealth
of
the
moment
a
great
part
of
the
illusion
as
i
have
said
is
due
to
the
fact
that
the
gentry
of
every
epoch
come
into
contact
with
the
jew
as
a
rich
man
and
it
is
the
capital
modern
vice
of
our
own
gentry
their
passion
for
mere
wealth
and
their
subservience
to
it
which
has
largely
accounted
for
this
dangerous
misunderstanding
look
around
you
in
western
europe
and
see
what
people
mean
by
this
story
of
jewish
wealth
see
who
the
people
are
that
allude
continually
to
it
and
spread
the
idea
of
it
they
are
the
rich
europeans
who
in
their
subservience
to
crude
wealth
in
their
habit
of
gauging
everything
by
that
wealth
and
of
submitting
to
almost
any
indignity
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
more
wealth
marry
their
daughters
to
jews
serve
jewish
interests
and
while
perpetually
sneering
at
the
jew
behind
his
back
call
him
to
his
face
by
his
most
intimate
name
and
make
the
most
of
his
hospitality
which
of
them
ever
knows
a
jew
let
alone
a
poor
jew
why
most
of
them
are
actually
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
this
mass
of
poor
jews
exists
at
all
they
serve
the
jew
when
he
is
wealthy
and
only
when
he
is
wealthy
they
envy
him
basely
as
a
wealthy
man
and
only
as
a
wealthy
man
they
prostitute
their
dignity
they
sell
their
not
from
any
genuine
affection
for
the
jewish
race
indeed
there
is
no
class
in
the
community
closely
intermixed
with
the
jews
as
they
are
which
feel
the
friction
more
than
the
gentry
but
simply
from
a
thirst
for
money
which
they
happen
to
find
held
in
great
masses
by
a
few
jewish
families
it
is
most
noticeable
that
other
aspects
of
jewish
activity
remain
unused
by
the
wealthy
class
the
gentry
and
therefore
by
the
state
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
use
them
or
not
is
another
matter
at
any
rate
the
motive
for
leaving
them
unused
is
the
fact
that
they
are
not
connected
with
wealth
the
jewish
intelligence
which
might
so
often
have
served
the
policy
of
a
statesman
is
largely
left
unused
the
cosmopolitan
position
of
the
jew
when
it
is
used
is
used
for
little
more
than
spying
and
that
profound
force
the
historical
memory
of
the
jew
is
neglected
almost
altogether
with
this
neglect
goes
a
natural
and
evil
result
the
failure
on
the
part
of
the
european
governing
classes
especially
to
safeguard
the
community
against
the
troubles
which
are
bound
to
arise
from
the
clashing
of
interests
between
the
jews
and
the
people
among
whom
they
dwell
it
may
sound
paradoxical
but
it
is
true
that
if
the
statesmen
of
europe
and
the
hereditary
families
of
the
european
nations
who
still
take
so
much
part
in
the
conduct
of
those
nations
had
thought
less
of
the
jewish
money
power
and
more
of
the
jews
as
a
whole
they
would
have
benefited
both
parties
in
a
very
different
fashion
we
have
seen
the
artificial
protection
of
the
jews
of
eastern
europe
because
individual
statesmen
have
been
subservient
to
the
commands
of
very
rich
individual
jewish
bankers
but
the
thing
has
been
done
blunderingly
it
has
served
only
to
anger
the
independent
nationalities
of
the
east
notably
the
poles
the
roumanians
and
the
hungarians
who
have
experience
of
the
difficulties
inseparable
from
an
alien
minority
our
politicians
have
treated
the
whole
affair
externally
and
mechanically
merely
obeying
orders
without
trying
to
understand
the
ultimate
result
of
such
interference
by
our
western
politicians
is
unhappily
certain
the
last
state
of
the
jews
in
eastern
europe
will
be
worse
than
the
first
their
sufferings
will
be
greater
than
in
the
past
and
that
because
instead
of
acting
from
attempted
comprehension
and
sympathetic
comprehension
of
the
jewish
difficulties
the
politicians
who
have
acted
as
the
servants
of
a
few
wealthy
jews
have
merely
obeyed
the
orders
of
these
rich
men
and
have
done
so
with
the
secret
reluctance
that
always
accompanies
to
a
wage
is
it
not
apparent
as
we
look
through
history
that
the
permanent
power
of
the
jew
or
at
any
rate
the
celebrity
of
his
nation
is
utterly
distinct
from
those
chance
accumulations
of
wealth
which
a
few
individuals
owe
to
the
national
passion
for
speculation
and
a
cosmopolitan
position
one
after
another
the
striking
jewish
names
of
history
are
the
names
of
jews
who
have
ardently
pursued
some
moral
or
intellectual
thesis
most
of
them
i
had
nearly
said
of
them
were
poor
men
and
for
the
most
part
men
deliberately
poor
because
they
preferred
as
it
is
in
the
jewish
nature
to
prefer
the
immediate
work
in
hand
to
any
other
consideration
it
is
these
names
that
remain
and
are
permanent
and
are
the
glory
of
the
jewish
race
there
is
one
aspect
of
this
jewish
wealth
which
i
hesitate
whether
to
put
among
the
general
or
among
the
particular
causes
of
the
friction
between
that
nation
and
its
hosts
it
falls
certainly
among
the
general
causes
in
the
sense
that
it
is
connected
with
the
jewish
character
as
a
whole
and
not
with
any
special
method
in
that
character
action
it
is
connected
i
mean
with
their
very
nature
and
they
can
not
change
that
nature
on
the
other
hand
it
might
be
put
among
the
particular
causes
on
account
of
its
quite
modern
and
probably
ephemeral
character
it
is
as
it
were
a
particular
cause
of
the
friction
proceeding
from
the
general
causes
of
character
just
enumerated
and
this
cause
of
friction
is
the
presence
of
jewish
monopoly
it
is
an
exceedingly
dangerous
point
in
the
present
situation
i
do
not
think
that
the
jews
have
a
sufficient
appreciation
of
the
risk
they
are
running
by
its
development
there
is
already
something
like
a
jewish
monopoly
in
high
finance
there
is
a
growing
tendency
to
jewish
monopoly
over
the
stage
for
instance
the
fruit
trade
in
london
and
to
a
great
extent
the
tobacco
trade
there
is
the
same
element
of
jewish
monopoly
in
the
silver
trade
and
in
the
control
of
various
other
metals
notably
lead
nickel
quicksilver
what
is
most
disquieting
of
all
this
tendency
to
monopoly
is
spreading
like
a
disease
one
province
after
another
falls
under
it
and
it
acts
as
a
most
powerful
irritant
it
will
perhaps
prove
the
immediate
cause
of
that
explosion
against
the
jews
which
we
all
dread
and
which
the
best
of
us
i
hope
are
trying
to
avert
it
applies
of
course
to
a
tiny
fraction
of
the
jewish
race
as
a
whole
one
could
put
the
jews
who
control
lead
nickel
mercury
and
the
rest
into
one
small
room
nor
would
that
room
contain
very
pleasant
specimens
of
their
race
you
could
get
the
great
jewish
bankers
who
control
international
finance
round
one
large
dinner
table
and
i
know
dinner
tables
which
have
seen
nearly
all
of
them
at
one
time
or
another
these
monopolists
in
strategic
positions
of
universal
control
are
an
insignificant
handful
of
men
out
of
the
millions
of
israel
just
as
the
great
fortunes
we
have
been
discussing
attach
to
an
insignificant
proportion
of
that
race
nevertheless
this
claim
to
an
exercise
of
monopoly
brings
hatred
upon
the
jews
as
a
whole
the
thing
is
deservedly
hated
because
it
is
exceedingly
unnatural
and
exceedingly
tyrannical
it
would
be
tyrannical
even
for
one
of
our
own
people
to
hold
us
up
in
the
supply
of
things
essential
to
us
it
is
intolerable
in
a
people
alien
to
us
when
we
come
to
discuss
in
the
next
chapter
the
unfortunate
use
of
secrecy
by
the
jews
the
most
potent
perhaps
of
the
particular
causes
which
have
lead
them
into
their
present
peril
we
shall
better
understand
another
odious
feature
in
this
modern
monopoly
of
control
which
is
the
way
in
which
it
spreads
underground
and
out
of
sight
leaving
the
world
in
general
ignorant
that
this
that
and
the
other
individual
jew
is
its
master
in
the
matter
of
some
essential
thing
which
he
controls
to
put
it
plainly
these
monopolies
must
be
put
an
end
to
before
the
great
war
there
was
only
one
of
which
europe
as
a
whole
was
conscious
and
that
was
the
financial
monopoly
yet
here
the
monopoly
was
far
less
perfect
than
in
the
case
of
the
metals
the
great
war
brought
thousands
upon
thousands
of
educated
men
who
took
up
public
duties
as
temporary
officials
up
against
the
staggering
secret
they
had
never
suspected
the
complete
control
exercised
over
things
absolutely
necessary
to
the
nation
survival
by
half
a
dozen
jews
who
were
completely
indifferent
as
to
whether
we
or
the
enemy
should
emerge
alive
from
the
struggle
incidentally
the
wealth
of
these
few
and
very
wealthy
jews
has
been
scandalously
increased
through
the
war
on
this
very
account
and
at
the
moment
in
which
i
write
the
french
press
which
has
a
longer
experience
in
the
free
discussion
of
the
jewish
question
than
any
other
is
exposing
the
abominable
increase
in
value
of
the
rothschild
lead
mines
an
increase
mainly
due
to
the
use
of
lead
for
the
killing
of
men
but
lead
is
only
one
of
the
monopolies
as
i
have
said
a
whole
group
already
exists
and
the
extension
of
the
system
is
going
on
as
rapidly
as
an
epidemic
not
only
must
it
cease
before
any
solution
of
the
jewish
question
can
be
attempted
but
the
process
must
be
reversed
if
the
various
national
cabinets
do
not
interfere
to
protect
these
monopolies
then
to
any
attempt
at
justice
for
the
jew
in
the
legitimate
anger
against
a
few
pitiful
dozens
among
the
worst
specimens
of
the
nation
israel
as
a
whole
will
be
sacrificed
there
is
in
this
formation
of
monopolies
as
in
the
more
reputable
activities
of
the
nation
even
in
its
more
justly
famous
activities
even
in
its
glories
that
element
of
racial
character
which
is
never
absent
from
any
jewish
action
and
that
is
why
i
have
put
the
point
modern
and
ephemeral
as
it
is
among
the
general
causes
of
trouble
the
reason
these
general
monopolies
are
formed
by
jews
is
that
the
jew
is
international
tenacious
and
determined
upon
reaching
the
very
end
of
his
task
he
is
not
satisfied
in
any
trade
until
that
trade
is
as
far
as
possible
under
his
complete
control
and
he
has
for
the
extension
of
that
control
the
support
of
his
brethren
throughout
the
world
he
has
at
the
same
time
the
international
knowledge
and
international
indifference
which
further
aid
his
efforts
but
even
were
the
quite
recent
monopolies
in
metal
and
other
trades
taken
as
they
ought
to
be
taken
from
these
few
alien
masters
of
them
there
would
remain
that
partial
monopoly
it
is
not
at
all
a
complete
monopoly
which
a
few
jews
have
exercised
not
only
but
recurrently
throughout
history
over
the
highest
finance
that
is
over
the
credit
of
the
nations
and
therefore
as
never
before
over
the
whole
field
of
the
world
industry
should
that
partial
financial
monopoly
remain
uncorrected
it
will
produce
a
sufficient
hostility
against
the
jews
to
precipitate
of
itself
the
next
general
attack
upon
them
it
may
be
argued
that
this
fear
is
groundless
because
the
control
has
now
lasted
for
a
long
time
it
has
lasted
a
lifetime
even
in
its
present
hardly
complete
form
and
it
is
secure
because
its
operations
are
removed
from
general
observation
and
because
it
is
mixed
up
with
the
interests
of
all
the
wealthier
classes
i
am
afraid
these
arguments
will
not
hold
although
the
jewish
control
of
finance
is
not
a
thing
which
touches
the
public
at
large
yet
all
educated
men
down
to
a
comparatively
low
stratum
of
society
are
fully
aware
of
it
and
every
man
who
is
aware
of
it
resents
it
it
is
resented
almost
as
much
by
the
mass
of
poor
jews
as
by
the
but
in
a
different
way
again
although
this
financial
monopoly
does
not
directly
affect
the
economic
life
of
the
private
citizen
he
is
beginning
to
understand
more
and
more
how
it
indirectly
affects
it
it
affects
him
for
instance
through
his
patriotism
he
will
not
submit
to
be
told
that
in
order
to
suit
the
convenience
of
these
alien
bankers
he
must
forgo
the
rights
of
victory
and
allow
some
enemy
whom
he
has
justly
chastised
to
escape
the
consequences
of
that
chastisement
still
more
urgently
will
he
deny
the
right
of
the
jewish
bankers
to
interfere
with
the
national
reparation
due
to
him
for
damage
wantonly
done
in
the
course
of
hostilities
again
international
finance
does
not
live
separate
from
private
activities
it
touches
at
last
a
mass
of
individual
enterprises
and
through
those
individual
enterprises
its
action
is
questioned
and
examined
by
a
host
of
private
citizens
yet
again
the
jews
who
thus
control
international
finance
are
at
work
in
many
other
capacities
for
instance
some
of
them
stand
behind
those
great
industrial
insurance
schemes
which
are
so
detestable
to
the
mass
of
the
people
action
against
these
may
arise
any
moment
if
such
action
comes
one
may
be
certain
that
the
individual
attacked
will
be
remembered
in
his
capacity
of
international
financier
quite
as
much
as
in
his
capacity
of
a
battener
upon
the
lapsed
premiums
of
the
poor
sooner
or
later
the
character
of
this
monopoly
to
which
men
of
a
lifetime
ago
were
indifferent
through
ignorance
but
of
which
all
the
educated
part
of
the
community
is
aware
and
deeply
resents
will
be
appreciated
and
equally
resented
at
a
lower
level
still
when
society
is
sufficiently
filled
with
indignation
against
it
then
the
explosion
will
come
if
that
explosion
only
affected
the
rich
jews
immediately
concerned
no
one
would
much
regret
it
there
would
be
little
harm
done
but
the
trouble
is
that
it
will
almost
certainly
affect
the
whole
nation
to
which
those
individuals
belong
i
may
be
told
that
to
put
an
end
to
this
state
of
affairs
is
impossible
so
long
as
parliamentary
government
with
its
profound
corruption
endures
that
the
only
force
capable
of
dealing
with
the
plutocratic
evil
of
alien
monopoly
upon
this
scale
is
a
king
and
that
a
king
we
have
not
among
modern
nations
to
which
i
answer
that
the
parliamentary
system
will
not
last
for
ever
it
is
already
in
active
dissolution
among
ourselves
and
badly
hit
elsewhere
the
king
may
not
be
so
far
off
as
people
think
him
to
be
at
any
rate
in
one
way
or
another
the
thing
will
cease
and
will
probably
cease
in
violence
the
danger
is
that
if
it
ceases
in
violence
a
vast
number
of
innocent
will
be
involved
with
the
guilty
the
special
causes
of
friction
chapter
v
the
special
causes
of
friction
there
are
two
special
forces
upon
the
jewish
side
which
nourish
and
exasperate
the
inevitable
friction
between
the
jewish
race
and
its
hosts
it
will
be
well
to
deal
with
these
before
passing
to
the
corresponding
forces
upon
our
side
for
to
find
a
remedy
it
is
necessary
to
diagnose
the
disease
the
two
main
jewish
forces
which
exasperate
and
maintain
the
sense
of
friction
between
the
jews
and
their
hosts
are
first
of
all
the
jewish
reliance
upon
secrecy
and
secondly
the
jewish
expression
of
superiority
the
jewish
reliance
upon
secrecy
it
has
unfortunately
now
become
a
habit
for
so
many
generations
that
it
has
almost
passed
into
an
instinct
throughout
the
jewish
body
to
rely
upon
the
weapon
of
secrecy
secret
societies
a
language
kept
as
far
as
possible
secret
the
use
of
false
names
in
order
to
hide
secret
movements
secret
relations
between
various
parts
of
the
jewish
body
all
these
and
other
forms
of
secrecy
have
become
the
national
method
it
is
a
method
to
be
deplored
not
because
its
indignity
and
falsehood
degrade
the
jew
that
is
not
our
affair
but
rather
on
account
of
the
this
policy
produces
on
our
mutual
relations
it
feeds
and
intensifies
the
antagonism
already
excited
by
racial
contrast
but
before
we
go
further
it
is
essential
to
be
just
for
no
one
understands
anything
if
he
attacks
it
unjustly
the
jewish
habit
of
secrecy
the
assumption
of
false
names
and
the
pretence
of
origin
in
individuals
the
concealment
of
relationships
and
the
rest
of
it
have
presumably
sprung
from
the
experience
of
the
race
let
a
man
put
himself
in
the
place
of
the
jew
and
he
will
see
how
sound
the
presumption
is
a
race
scattered
persecuted
often
despised
always
suspected
and
nearly
always
hated
by
those
among
whom
it
moves
is
constrained
by
something
like
physical
force
to
the
use
of
secret
methods
take
the
particular
trick
of
false
names
it
seems
to
us
particularly
odious
we
think
when
we
show
our
contempt
for
those
who
use
this
subterfuge
that
we
are
giving
them
no
more
than
they
deserve
it
is
a
meanness
which
we
associate
with
criminals
and
vagabonds
a
piece
of
crawling
and
sneaking
we
suspect
its
practisers
of
desiring
to
hide
something
which
would
bring
them
into
disgrace
if
it
were
known
or
of
desiring
to
their
fellows
in
commerce
by
a
form
of
falsehood
but
the
jew
has
other
and
better
motives
as
one
of
their
community
said
to
me
with
great
force
when
i
discussed
the
matter
with
him
many
years
ago
at
a
city
dinner
when
we
work
under
our
own
names
you
abuse
us
as
jews
when
we
work
under
names
you
abuse
us
as
forgers
the
jew
has
often
felt
himself
so
handicapped
if
he
declared
himself
that
he
was
half
forced
or
at
any
rate
grievously
tempted
to
a
piece
of
baseness
which
was
never
a
temptation
for
us
surely
all
this
carefully
arranged
code
of
assumed
patronymics
stanley
for
solomon
curzon
for
cohen
sinclair
for
slezinger
montague
for
moses
benson
for
benjamin
etc
had
its
root
in
that
the
jew
can
plead
something
further
in
extenuation
of
this
practice
family
names
did
not
grow
up
naturally
with
them
as
with
us
in
the
course
of
the
middle
ages
the
jew
retained
as
we
long
retained
in
the
middle
and
lower
ranks
of
european
society
the
simple
habit
of
possessing
one
personal
name
and
differentiating
a
man
from
his
fellows
by
introducing
the
name
of
his
father
thus
a
jew
in
the
sixteenth
century
was
moses
ben
solomon
just
as
the
cromwells
ancestor
of
the
same
generation
was
williams
ap
williams
he
had
not
what
we
call
a
surname
or
family
name
in
the
same
way
until
varying
dates
early
in
france
and
england
and
other
western
countries
much
later
in
wales
brittany
poland
and
the
slav
countries
of
the
east
a
man
was
known
only
by
his
personal
name
distinguished
if
that
were
necessary
by
mentioning
also
the
name
of
his
father
or
in
some
cases
of
his
tribe
properly
speaking
the
jews
have
no
surnames
and
they
may
say
with
justice
since
we
were
compelled
to
take
surnames
arbitrarily
which
was
the
case
in
the
germanies
and
sometimes
elsewhere
as
well
you
can
not
blame
us
if
we
attach
no
particular
sanctity
to
the
custom
if
a
jew
of
plain
jewish
name
was
compelled
by
alien
force
to
take
the
fancy
name
of
flowerfield
he
is
surely
free
to
change
that
fancy
name
for
which
he
is
not
responsible
to
any
other
he
chooses
there
was
a
good
reason
for
the
government
to
force
a
name
upon
him
only
thus
could
he
be
registered
and
his
actions
traced
but
forced
it
was
and
therefore
on
him
not
morally
binding
all
this
is
true
but
there
remains
an
element
not
to
be
accounted
for
on
any
such
pleas
there
are
in
the
experience
of
all
of
us
an
experience
repeated
indefinitely
men
who
have
no
excuse
whatsoever
for
a
false
name
save
that
advantage
of
deceit
men
whose
race
is
universally
known
will
unblushingly
adopt
a
false
name
as
a
mask
and
after
a
year
or
two
pretend
to
treat
it
as
an
insult
if
their
original
and
true
name
be
used
in
its
place
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
the
great
financial
families
some
indeed
have
the
pride
to
maintain
the
original
patronymic
and
refuse
to
change
it
in
any
of
their
descendants
but
the
great
mass
of
them
concealed
their
relations
one
with
another
by
adopting
all
manner
of
fantastic
titles
and
there
can
be
no
object
in
such
a
proceeding
save
the
object
of
deception
i
admit
it
is
a
form
of
protection
and
especially
do
i
admit
that
in
its
origin
it
may
have
mainly
derived
from
a
necessity
for
but
i
maintain
that
the
practice
does
nothing
but
harm
to
the
jew
there
are
other
races
which
have
suffered
persecution
many
of
them
up
and
down
the
world
and
we
do
not
find
in
them
a
universal
habit
of
this
kind
again
who
can
say
that
the
bearing
of
a
jewish
name
or
at
any
rate
in
the
immediate
past
is
or
was
a
handicap
in
commerce
where
occidental
nations
were
concerned
and
as
for
the
eastern
nations
the
jews
there
are
so
sharply
differentiated
that
a
false
name
can
be
of
no
service
merely
to
hide
the
racial
character
of
its
bearer
there
must
be
another
motive
present
the
same
arguments
apply
for
and
against
other
forms
of
secrecy
a
man
may
plead
that
if
secrecy
in
relationship
were
not
maintained
the
dislike
of
jews
would
lead
to
false
accusations
the
jew
is
highly
individual
especially
in
intellectual
affairs
he
takes
his
own
line
he
expresses
his
opinions
with
singular
courage
and
such
individual
opinions
will
often
differ
violently
from
those
of
men
with
whom
he
is
most
closely
connected
why
i
can
understand
some
distinguished
jewish
publicist
in
england
saying
should
i
be
compromised
by
people
knowing
that
a
bolshevist
in
moscow
or
in
new
york
is
my
cousin
or
nephew
i
am
conservative
in
temperament
i
have
always
served
faithfully
the
state
in
which
i
live
i
heartily
disapprove
of
these
people
views
and
actions
if
their
relationship
with
me
were
known
i
should
fall
under
the
common
ban
that
would
be
unjust
therefore
i
keep
the
relationship
secret
the
plea
is
sound
but
it
does
not
cover
the
ground
it
is
not
sufficient
to
explain
for
instance
the
habit
of
hiding
relationships
between
men
equally
distinguished
and
equally
approved
in
the
different
societies
in
which
they
move
it
does
not
explain
why
we
must
be
left
in
ignorance
of
the
fact
that
a
man
whom
we
are
treating
as
the
best
of
should
hide
his
connection
with
another
man
who
is
treated
with
equal
honour
in
another
country
there
are
occasions
where
national
conflicts
make
the
thing
explicable
a
jew
in
england
with
a
brother
in
germany
and
a
father
at
constantinople
might
well
be
excused
in
for
calling
himself
montmorency
yet
we
note
that
often
where
there
is
most
need
to
hide
the
connection
the
connection
is
not
hidden
at
all
on
the
contrary
it
is
openly
advertised
we
all
recollect
the
name
of
one
jewish
financier
who
was
most
unjustly
treated
during
the
war
he
had
faithfully
served
this
country
and
the
breach
of
his
connection
with
it
was
to
my
mind
at
least
and
i
think
to
most
people
who
can
judge
the
matter
a
very
bad
thing
for
britain
in
the
conflict
yet
there
was
here
no
change
of
name
and
no
attempt
to
hide
the
connection
between
himself
and
his
brother
who
stood
in
another
capital
for
the
financial
policy
of
our
enemies
again
the
rothschilds
present
in
the
various
capitals
of
europe
have
never
pretended
to
hide
their
mutual
relationships
and
no
one
has
thought
any
the
worse
of
them
nor
has
this
open
practice
in
any
way
diminished
their
financial
power
there
must
be
more
than
necessity
at
work
i
suggest
that
there
is
something
like
instinct
or
at
any
rate
an
inherited
tradition
so
strong
that
recourse
to
it
seems
natural
now
it
can
not
be
too
forcibly
emphasized
that
secrecy
in
any
of
these
forms
working
through
secret
societies
using
false
names
hiding
of
relationships
denying
jewish
origin
specially
exasperates
this
our
own
race
among
which
the
jews
are
thrown
in
their
dispersion
it
is
invariably
discovered
sooner
or
later
and
whenever
it
is
discovered
men
have
an
angry
feeling
that
they
have
been
duped
even
in
cases
where
the
practice
is
most
innocent
and
is
no
more
than
the
following
of
something
like
a
ritual
i
doubt
whether
the
jews
have
any
idea
how
strongly
this
force
works
against
them
if
a
man
were
to
say
my
name
is
my
father
was
born
at
a
place
in
galicia
my
brother
is
still
there
in
a
business
if
he
told
us
all
that
he
would
not
suffer
upon
our
appreciating
later
on
that
members
of
his
family
abroad
were
connected
with
movements
we
disapproved
no
not
even
with
a
government
in
active
hostility
to
our
own
everybody
knows
the
international
position
of
the
jew
everybody
knows
that
he
can
not
avoid
that
position
everybody
makes
allowances
for
it
and
i
conceive
that
the
abandonment
of
this
habit
of
secrecy
is
not
only
possible
but
would
be
very
greatly
to
the
advantage
of
the
whole
race
perhaps
its
most
absurd
form
not
its
most
dangerous
form
is
the
secrecy
maintained
by
distinguished
men
with
regard
to
their
jewish
ancestors
they
and
their
jewish
relations
often
suppress
it
altogether
or
at
best
touch
on
it
rarely
and
obscurely
why
should
they
act
thus
take
the
case
of
two
men
at
random
out
of
hundreds
whose
names
are
universally
known
and
by
most
people
respected
the
name
of
charles
kingsley
the
writer
and
the
name
of
the
founder
of
the
salvation
army
here
are
two
men
who
in
very
different
fields
played
a
great
part
in
english
life
and
who
both
owed
their
genius
and
nearly
all
their
physical
appearance
to
jewish
mothers
i
should
have
thought
it
to
the
advantage
of
the
jewish
race
and
of
the
individuals
concerned
that
this
fact
should
be
widely
known
the
literary
abilities
of
charles
kingsley
the
organizing
and
other
abilities
of
booth
are
not
lessened
in
people
eyes
but
if
anything
enhanced
by
a
knowledge
of
their
true
lineage
yet
the
mention
of
that
lineage
is
treated
as
though
it
were
a
sort
of
insult
i
have
heard
it
wrung
out
in
some
passionate
plea
for
the
jewish
race
as
a
proof
that
they
are
not
devoid
of
abilities
but
never
generally
published
surely
it
would
be
more
sensible
to
emphasize
in
every
possible
case
the
jewish
or
partially
jewish
origin
of
men
who
distinguished
themselves
and
thus
to
show
under
what
a
debt
europeans
stand
to
the
jewish
blood
to
treat
the
matter
as
a
sort
of
sacred
labyrinth
as
a
mysterious
temple
into
which
one
may
now
and
then
be
allowed
to
peep
is
ridiculous
the
jews
can
not
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too
if
it
is
surely
it
must
be
in
their
eyes
a
matter
for
pride
to
belong
to
blood
which
they
hold
to
be
superior
and
to
a
tradition
of
such
immense
antiquity
then
it
can
not
be
at
the
same
time
a
matter
of
insult
yet
the
convention
is
desperately
maintained
by
the
jews
themselves
if
a
man
tells
me
that
he
hates
the
english
and
in
reply
i
say
that
because
you
are
an
irishman
he
does
not
fly
at
my
throat
he
takes
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
history
of
the
english
government
in
ireland
excuses
his
expression
so
far
from
being
insulted
at
being
called
an
irishman
he
would
be
insulted
if
you
said
he
was
not
an
irishman
and
so
it
is
with
many
another
nationality
which
has
suffered
oppression
and
persecution
i
can
find
no
rational
basis
for
a
contrary
policy
in
the
case
of
the
jews
moreover
the
habit
does
this
further
harm
it
makes
men
ascribe
a
jewish
character
to
anything
they
dislike
and
thus
extends
undeservedly
the
odium
against
the
race
a
foreign
movement
against
one
nation
an
unpopular
public
figure
a
detested
doctrine
are
labelled
jewish
and
the
field
of
hate
already
perilously
wide
is
broadened
indefinitely
it
is
useless
to
say
the
jews
do
not
admit
the
connection
the
names
are
not
jewish
there
is
no
overt
jewish
element
he
answers
jews
never
do
admit
such
connection
jews
admittedly
hide
under
false
names
jewish
action
never
overt
and
as
things
are
until
they
change
there
is
no
denying
what
he
says
his
judgment
may
be
as
wild
as
you
will
i
have
heard
sinn
feiners
called
jews
but
so
long
as
this
wretched
habit
of
secrecy
is
maintained
there
is
no
correcting
that
judgment
a
universal
suspicion
is
engendered
and
spreads
meanwhile
the
same
vice
drags
into
publicity
every
jewish
act
and
name
and
leaves
in
obscurity
the
honoured
names
and
useful
public
actions
of
jewry
for
a
false
name
like
a
forgery
advertises
itself
it
is
not
always
recognized
in
this
connection
that
the
jewish
booms
which
are
so
fruitful
a
cause
of
exasperation
depend
on
this
same
policy
of
concealment
and
on
that
account
add
to
the
volume
of
anger
as
each
new
trick
is
discovered
not
that
the
objects
of
these
campaigns
are
unworthy
of
attention
the
jewish
actor
or
or
writer
or
scientist
selected
is
usually
talented
the
victim
of
injustice
whose
case
is
advertised
on
the
big
drum
has
often
a
genuine
grievance
but
that
the
notice
demanded
is
out
of
all
proportion
and
that
its
dependence
on
jewish
organization
is
always
kept
hidden
so
much
for
the
element
of
secret
action
a
great
deal
more
might
be
written
upon
it
but
there
are
two
reasons
against
enlarging
thereon
first
a
full
discussion
would
take
up
far
too
much
of
my
space
secondly
it
would
tend
to
add
what
i
particularly
wish
to
avoid
in
these
pages
i
mean
emphasis
upon
the
errors
of
the
jew
it
would
continue
a
quarrel
our
whole
object
in
which
is
to
find
peace
the
expression
of
superiority
by
the
jew
this
is
a
very
different
matter
the
mere
of
superiority
is
not
something
in
which
any
special
policy
can
be
recommended
because
it
is
there
and
can
not
be
remedied
it
is
part
of
the
whole
position
but
it
is
possible
to
restrain
its
expression
for
that
purpose
it
is
of
value
to
define
it
to
put
it
upon
record
and
to
estimate
its
effect
upon
our
issue
the
jew
individually
feels
himself
superior
to
his
contemporary
and
neighbour
of
whatever
race
and
particularly
of
our
race
the
jew
feels
his
nation
immeasurably
superior
to
any
other
human
community
and
particularly
to
our
modern
national
communities
in
europe
the
frank
statement
of
so
simple
and
fundamental
a
truth
is
rarely
made
it
will
sound
i
fear
shocking
in
many
ears
to
many
others
it
will
sound
not
so
much
shocking
as
comic
and
to
many
more
stupefying
the
idea
that
the
jew
should
think
himself
our
superior
is
something
so
incomprehensible
to
us
that
we
forget
the
existence
of
the
feeling
if
it
be
constantly
reiterated
for
the
purpose
of
dealing
with
this
great
political
difficulty
it
is
perhaps
reluctantly
admitted
but
still
held
as
sort
of
abnormal
bewildering
truth
i
contend
that
the
forgetfulness
of
that
truth
the
attempt
to
solve
the
problem
without
that
truth
remaining
constant
and
fixed
in
the
mind
of
the
statesman
is
in
a
very
large
measure
the
cause
of
our
failure
in
the
past
and
that
the
way
the
jew
openly
acts
upon
it
in
gesture
tone
manner
social
assertion
is
a
very
important
factor
in
the
quarrel
between
his
race
and
ours
consider
the
attitude
of
statesmanship
in
the
past
towards
this
vital
conflict
in
every
such
attitude
i
think
the
jewish
conviction
of
superiority
has
been
omitted
for
the
attitudes
taken
up
by
european
statesmen
in
the
past
towards
the
alien
jewish
element
in
their
midst
have
always
been
one
of
three
sorts
either
they
have
acted
as
though
there
were
no
jewish
nation
as
though
the
jew
were
merely
a
private
citizen
like
any
other
who
happened
to
have
peculiar
opinions
and
customs
of
his
own
but
who
was
not
substantially
different
from
the
men
around
him
or
they
have
attempted
to
suppress
or
to
expel
or
to
destroy
the
jew
with
ignominy
and
violence
or
while
recognizing
the
existence
of
the
jewish
nation
as
something
separate
from
their
own
whom
they
have
to
administrate
the
statesmen
have
tried
to
arrive
at
equilibrium
by
a
sort
of
pact
in
which
jewish
separateness
was
recognized
under
conditions
of
now
in
all
these
three
methods
there
is
absent
all
recognition
of
the
jewish
feeling
of
superiority
in
the
first
it
is
obviously
lacking
because
the
whole
idea
of
a
jewish
nation
is
absent
it
is
equally
obviously
lacking
from
the
second
method
that
of
persecution
the
persecutor
instinctively
acts
as
though
the
jew
felt
himself
to
be
an
inferior
in
the
third
method
it
is
also
absent
not
in
theory
but
in
practice
for
the
statesmen
who
have
acted
thus
in
the
past
have
not
attempted
to
give
the
jews
a
status
only
they
have
in
point
of
fact
nearly
always
given
them
an
status
by
so
doing
they
have
exasperated
the
jewish
national
sentiment
for
instance
certain
nations
have
treated
jews
as
a
separate
people
as
aliens
by
forbidding
them
untrammelled
residence
and
enforcing
registration
but
when
it
came
to
taxation
or
freedom
from
military
service
there
was
no
special
recognition
of
the
jew
there
is
indeed
a
fourth
attitude
which
has
occasionally
appeared
in
history
when
states
have
been
in
active
decline
or
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
base
and
weak
men
and
that
is
the
exaggerated
flattery
and
support
of
a
few
powerful
wealthy
jews
by
administrators
who
were
bribed
or
cowed
we
are
suffering
from
that
but
these
exceptional
cases
they
have
always
led
to
national
disaster
do
not
form
a
true
category
of
in
the
matter
nor
is
there
even
in
those
who
thus
actually
advantage
a
few
jews
above
their
own
and
give
them
special
prominence
and
power
so
much
a
recognition
of
the
jewish
sense
of
superiority
as
a
secret
hatred
of
their
jewish
masters
bitter
as
is
everywhere
the
secret
attack
on
the
jews
by
those
who
have
subjected
themselves
for
gain
or
publicity
it
is
nowhere
so
bitter
as
in
the
private
speech
of
the
politicians
it
would
seem
in
the
presence
of
so
many
failures
in
policy
and
all
these
failures
having
in
common
the
of
this
jewish
feeling
that
success
can
never
be
obtained
unless
we
fully
allow
for
it
i
submit
that
there
will
never
be
peace
between
any
jewish
alien
minority
and
the
community
within
which
it
may
happen
to
reside
until
those
who
administrate
that
community
fully
accept
and
studiously
avoid
the
exasperation
of
this
state
of
the
jewish
mind
in
statesmanship
as
in
every
other
form
of
human
activity
exact
definition
is
of
the
first
importance
we
must
distinguish
at
the
outset
between
this
jewish
sense
of
superiority
and
any
real
superiority
the
statesman
is
not
concerned
with
the
rightness
or
wrongness
of
the
jewish
attitude
it
may
be
a
most
absurd
illusion
or
it
may
be
a
most
profound
vision
he
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
having
made
up
his
mind
that
the
small
and
quite
alien
minority
must
be
tolerated
and
must
be
allowed
to
live
as
happily
as
possible
in
the
midst
of
a
community
from
which
it
so
profoundly
differs
his
next
duty
is
to
know
thoroughly
the
nature
of
the
material
upon
which
he
is
acting
and
with
which
he
has
to
deal
he
may
smile
at
the
jewish
sense
of
superiority
he
may
even
be
privately
indignant
but
he
must
be
quite
sure
that
it
is
a
permanent
part
of
the
nation
with
which
he
has
to
settle
it
will
never
be
removed
the
jew
in
the
east
end
of
london
the
poorest
of
the
poor
feels
himself
the
superior
of
the
magistrate
before
whom
he
is
hauled
of
the
policeman
who
keeps
order
in
the
streets
and
immensely
the
superior
of
the
soldiers
and
sailors
whose
trade
is
the
most
typical
of
our
own
race
he
even
feels
himself
the
superior
of
those
whom
he
better
understands
the
negotiators
the
people
who
live
by
cunning
the
expression
of
our
faces
our
gesture
our
manner
the
very
fact
that
our
minds
less
acute
are
also
broader
confirms
his
feeling
this
fixed
idea
of
superiority
which
appears
in
every
phrase
and
implication
is
taken
for
granted
by
the
jew
it
is
felt
i
say
by
the
poorest
and
most
oppressed
the
least
rich
and
the
most
unfortunate
of
the
jewish
people
in
our
midst
unfortunately
and
this
is
the
crux
it
proceeds
to
it
is
this
which
is
so
violently
resented
it
is
this
which
aggravates
the
quarrel
it
is
this
which
must
be
kept
in
control
if
we
are
to
have
peace
not
the
sense
of
superiority
that
is
ineradicable
but
the
expression
of
it
it
appears
as
we
all
know
with
extraordinary
emphasis
in
the
action
and
manner
of
the
few
very
wealthy
jews
with
whom
the
directing
classes
of
the
nation
are
better
acquainted
but
whether
he
be
a
rich
man
suffering
only
from
alien
and
hostile
surroundings
or
a
poor
man
suffering
from
all
the
lowering
forces
of
squalor
of
destitution
and
of
contempt
the
jew
feels
himself
the
potential
master
of
his
hosts
and
shows
it
he
reposes
in
the
same
confidence
as
was
felt
by
disraeli
when
he
said
the
jew
can
not
be
absorbed
it
is
not
possible
for
a
superior
race
to
be
absorbed
by
an
inferior
but
unfortunately
he
does
not
only
repose
on
that
foundation
he
also
upon
it
and
that
is
intolerable
we
must
i
say
allow
for
this
feeling
in
any
settlement
we
make
we
have
also
to
study
its
consequences
otherwise
we
shall
be
baffled
by
phenomena
which
would
seem
inexplicable
but
we
need
not
allow
for
on
the
contrary
we
should
actively
condemn
an
open
attitude
of
jewish
contempt
for
ourselves
here
are
some
consequences
of
this
open
expression
of
superiority
consequences
which
we
all
discover
in
the
relations
between
the
jewish
people
and
ourselves
and
which
are
leading
us
into
a
situation
very
dangerous
for
them
and
for
us
first
you
have
that
familiar
handling
of
european
things
by
the
jew
which
is
continually
stirring
the
wrath
of
the
european
and
as
continually
leaving
the
jew
in
wonderment
what
possible
harm
he
can
have
done
thus
the
jew
will
write
of
our
religion
taking
for
granted
that
it
is
folly
and
will
marvel
that
we
are
offended
he
will
appear
in
our
national
discussions
not
only
giving
advice
but
attempting
to
direct
policy
and
will
be
puzzled
to
discover
that
his
indifference
to
national
feeling
is
annoying
he
will
postulate
the
jewish
temperament
as
something
which
if
different
from
ours
must
whether
we
like
it
or
not
be
thrust
upon
us
he
acts
in
all
these
things
as
every
one
acts
instinctively
in
the
presence
of
those
whom
they
take
for
granted
to
be
inferiors
and
when
men
talk
of
the
jewish
insolence
or
the
jewish
sneer
they
imply
that
attitude
we
are
wrong
if
we
take
these
things
as
calculated
insult
the
action
of
the
jew
in
so
far
as
it
proceeds
from
this
sense
of
superiority
is
no
more
calculated
and
no
more
deliberately
hostile
than
are
our
own
actions
whenever
we
find
ourselves
in
relations
with
those
whom
we
think
inferior
to
ourselves
but
we
are
right
to
point
them
out
to
resent
them
to
reprove
them
and
if
it
became
necessary
to
end
them
the
jewish
problem
will
never
be
solved
unless
we
make
allowances
for
the
sense
of
superiority
take
it
for
granted
as
an
unavoidable
evil
and
restrain
our
indignation
in
its
presence
but
neither
will
it
be
solved
if
we
permit
its
more
and
more
open
expression
another
consequence
of
this
attitude
the
jew
on
account
of
it
makes
no
effort
to
get
into
touch
with
the
mass
of
the
race
in
the
midst
of
which
he
may
happen
to
be
living
he
is
content
to
remain
separate
from
it
and
thinks
he
can
not
help
remaining
separate
from
them
and
he
shows
it
he
consents
to
associate
with
the
with
those
who
direct
with
those
who
have
some
special
sort
of
function
but
it
seems
to
him
a
waste
of
time
to
attempt
communion
with
the
rest
and
he
shows
it
that
is
what
renan
meant
when
he
said
that
the
jews
were
the
least
democratic
of
all
people
renan
who
was
supported
by
jewish
money
and
lived
while
he
was
doing
his
best
work
dependent
on
a
jewish
publisher
renan
who
was
so
fascinated
by
the
history
of
israel
and
who
decided
himself
to
become
a
scholar
in
all
hebraic
things
understood
the
jew
not
at
all
his
judgments
upon
them
are
invariably
superficial
and
to
one
side
of
the
truth
the
judgments
of
a
foreigner
an
admiring
foreigner
but
not
a
sympathetic
foreigner
and
when
he
said
that
the
jews
were
not
democratic
he
was
instead
of
passing
a
judgment
upon
an
intimate
political
instinct
of
the
jewish
people
simply
noting
an
external
phenomenon
for
the
jews
are
as
a
fact
strongly
democratic
no
nation
more
so
in
their
national
relations
among
themselves
they
only
appear
undemocratic
to
us
because
they
openly
look
down
on
us
among
whom
they
live
another
form
taken
by
that
open
expression
of
the
sense
of
superiority
among
the
jews
it
lends
to
all
their
actions
in
our
state
a
certain
assurance
and
solidity
which
vastly
strengthens
their
power
of
resistance
no
doubt
but
also
provokes
their
misfortunes
the
religious
interpreter
of
history
might
say
that
they
had
been
specially
endowed
with
this
sense
by
providence
because
providence
intended
them
to
survive
as
a
national
unit
miraculously
in
the
face
of
every
disability
to
remain
themselves
for
years
under
conditions
which
would
have
destroyed
any
other
people
in
perhaps
a
century
and
yet
intended
to
suffer
the
rationalist
will
say
that
the
expression
of
a
sense
of
superiority
and
the
power
of
resistance
that
accompanies
it
are
but
different
names
for
the
same
thing
that
but
for
the
presence
of
that
expression
of
superiority
the
resistance
could
not
have
succeeded
but
for
the
resistance
there
could
have
been
no
persecution
that
there
was
no
design
in
the
matter
only
the
chance
presence
of
a
particular
quality
which
has
produced
its
necessary
and
logical
effect
but
whichever
be
the
true
explanation
the
historical
fact
remains
that
this
sense
of
superiority
produced
an
open
and
overweening
expression
of
it
whenever
the
jews
have
been
free
to
give
vent
to
their
feelings
and
that
while
it
has
had
as
one
great
consequence
the
strengthening
of
the
identity
permanence
survival
of
the
jewish
people
it
has
also
had
for
another
great
consequence
their
recurrent
oppression
following
on
every
period
of
freedom
there
is
one
last
thing
to
be
said
which
it
is
almost
impossible
to
say
without
the
danger
of
giving
pain
and
therefore
of
confusing
the
problem
and
making
the
solution
more
difficult
but
it
must
be
said
because
if
we
shirk
it
the
problem
is
confused
the
more
it
is
this
while
it
is
undoubtedly
true
and
will
always
be
true
that
a
jew
feels
himself
the
superior
of
his
hosts
it
is
also
true
that
his
hosts
feel
themselves
immeasurably
superior
to
the
jew
we
can
only
arrive
at
a
just
and
peaceable
solution
of
our
difficulties
by
remembering
that
the
jew
to
whom
we
have
given
special
and
alien
status
in
the
commonwealth
is
all
the
while
thinking
of
himself
as
our
superior
but
on
his
side
the
jew
must
recognize
however
unpalatable
to
him
the
recognition
may
be
that
those
among
whom
he
is
living
and
whose
inferiority
he
takes
for
granted
on
side
regard
him
as
something
much
less
than
themselves
that
statement
i
know
will
be
as
stupefying
to
the
jew
as
its
converse
is
stupefying
to
us
it
will
seem
as
extraordinary
as
incredible
and
all
the
rest
of
it
but
it
is
true
and
it
is
a
permanent
truth
unless
the
jews
recognize
that
truth
the
trouble
will
go
on
indefinitely
there
is
no
european
so
mean
in
fortune
or
so
base
in
character
as
not
to
feel
himself
altogether
the
superior
of
any
jew
however
wealthy
however
powerful
and
i
am
afraid
i
must
add
however
good
true
virtue
has
a
superiority
of
its
own
which
can
not
be
hidden
and
the
cruel
or
the
treacherous
or
the
debauched
european
can
not
but
feel
himself
morally
inferior
to
a
jew
who
is
just
merciful
generous
and
the
rest
of
it
but
we
know
how
it
is
with
national
feelings
the
type
is
stronger
for
us
than
the
individual
and
while
we
may
recognize
certain
superior
characteristics
in
the
individual
we
are
thinking
all
the
while
of
the
race
of
the
communal
form
and
contrasting
our
own
with
the
alien
form
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
latter
so
difficult
is
it
for
the
jew
to
appreciate
this
factor
in
the
problem
that
his
lack
of
appreciation
has
been
almost
as
great
a
cause
of
difficulty
in
the
past
as
the
same
lack
upon
our
side
we
seem
to
him
insolent
when
in
our
own
eyes
we
are
merely
acting
normally
as
superiors
what
emotion
does
it
not
create
i
wonder
in
some
jewish
merchant
or
who
has
purchased
a
high
directing
place
in
our
plutocracy
when
he
discovers
from
the
gesture
the
tone
the
expression
of
some
chance
poor
englishman
perhaps
no
more
than
an
embarrassed
hack
writer
a
clear
feeling
of
superiority
must
it
not
seem
to
him
mere
insolence
what
possible
claim
he
will
say
within
himself
has
this
and
a
poor
unsuccessful
at
that
to
treat
as
though
i
were
less
than
he
i
who
am
worth
millions
who
am
ruling
and
doing
what
i
will
with
his
own
national
leaders
who
dispose
of
his
state
very
much
as
i
choose
and
who
belong
to
that
nation
which
is
wholly
above
all
others
the
jewish
people
everywhere
the
jew
discovers
the
consequences
of
this
feeling
even
though
that
feeling
be
to
him
so
incomprehensible
that
he
can
hardly
admit
its
existence
well
whether
he
likes
to
admit
it
or
not
it
is
there
individual
jews
may
be
flattered
for
the
sake
of
their
wealth
or
because
of
the
fear
of
them
in
which
a
commercial
community
stands
such
jews
as
mistake
the
current
printed
word
which
they
read
for
the
spoken
words
they
never
hear
may
fall
into
the
error
of
thinking
that
this
sense
of
superiority
on
our
part
did
not
exist
they
must
be
warned
if
ever
the
problem
is
to
be
solved
that
it
in
their
case
just
as
in
ours
a
right
solution
can
only
be
arrived
at
by
the
frank
admission
that
the
feeling
is
there
and
by
the
fixed
knowledge
that
whether
the
feeling
be
an
illusion
or
represent
a
reality
it
will
not
change
but
also
by
a
repression
of
it
in
our
mutual
relations
we
may
add
to
our
summary
of
this
subtle
but
profound
cause
of
disturbance
the
further
truth
that
a
paradox
of
the
sort
is
to
be
found
though
perhaps
less
emphasized
in
every
other
political
problem
the
diplomat
resident
in
a
foreign
capital
has
to
consider
not
only
his
own
certitude
that
his
hosts
are
inferior
but
their
certitude
of
their
own
superiority
to
him
and
his
the
general
in
the
field
may
be
certain
of
his
mastery
over
an
opponent
but
if
that
opponent
is
as
yet
undefeated
he
will
do
ill
to
forget
that
he
is
matched
by
a
confidence
equal
to
his
own
still
more
does
the
negotiator
in
commerce
act
upon
this
principle
and
recognize
it
or
at
least
if
he
fails
to
do
so
he
invites
disaster
for
when
the
commercial
man
is
occupied
in
overreaching
his
neighbour
his
chances
of
success
very
largely
depend
upon
his
treating
that
neighbour
as
though
he
really
were
what
he
believes
himself
to
be
he
may
be
dealing
with
a
stupid
and
vain
man
easily
to
be
overmatched
and
impoverished
but
if
he
lets
it
appear
that
he
regards
his
proposed
victim
as
a
vain
and
stupid
man
then
he
will
miss
his
bargain
in
general
there
is
no
success
over
others
nor
even
which
is
much
more
necessary
any
permanent
arrangement
possible
with
others
unless
we
know
allow
for
and
act
upon
the
of
others
however
wrong
we
may
believe
that
to
be
it
is
clear
that
in
this
conflict
between
the
jew
and
let
us
say
the
european
for
it
is
between
the
jew
and
the
white
occidental
race
that
our
present
problem
lies
though
the
same
problem
arises
with
all
other
races
among
whom
the
jew
may
find
himself
both
parties
can
not
be
right
a
being
superior
to
the
race
of
man
and
looking
on
our
petty
quarrels
might
be
able
to
decide
which
of
the
two
opponents
were
nearer
reality
and
whether
we
are
the
better
justified
in
our
contempt
of
the
jew
or
the
jew
in
his
contempt
of
us
but
in
working
out
our
own
solution
without
the
aid
of
such
guidance
there
is
no
rule
but
for
both
parties
to
take
for
granted
what
each
regards
as
an
illusion
in
the
other
to
restrain
its
expression
for
the
sake
of
reaching
a
settlement
and
in
the
settlement
they
arrive
at
to
admit
as
a
factor
necessarily
and
permanently
present
what
each
still
secretly
regards
as
a
folly
but
an
incurable
folly
in
the
other
the
alternative
to
such
is
a
falling
back
into
the
old
circle
of
submission
consequent
anger
accompanied
by
shame
and
violence
and
these
followed
by
remorse
the
cause
of
friction
upon
our
side
chapter
vi
the
cause
of
friction
upon
our
side
having
concluded
a
brief
review
of
the
causes
of
friction
upon
the
jewish
side
we
must
turn
to
the
cause
of
friction
upon
our
own
at
first
sight
it
might
seem
that
the
task
was
superfluous
action
and
reaction
are
equal
and
opposite
if
you
have
shown
why
a
irritates
b
you
have
also
presumably
shown
why
b
irritates
a
or
again
if
you
regard
an
alien
minority
in
a
community
as
an
irritant
which
it
nearly
always
is
and
which
it
certainly
is
in
the
case
of
the
jews
you
have
it
would
seem
sufficiently
defined
the
position
and
need
not
trouble
to
examine
what
part
the
irritated
play
in
the
matter
what
is
parasitical
at
the
worst
preys
upon
the
general
body
at
the
best
disturbs
it
the
general
body
would
appear
passive
it
has
no
part
in
the
business
but
to
react
against
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
and
if
possible
get
rid
of
it
as
that
cause
is
none
of
its
making
one
need
not
seek
for
any
responsibility
on
its
side
the
house
is
ours
the
jew
is
an
intruder
an
objector
may
say
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
but
the
situation
is
not
as
simple
as
that
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that
the
jew
will
certainly
not
allow
such
a
description
of
his
activity
there
is
the
obvious
truth
that
where
you
are
dealing
with
two
factors
that
is
with
two
factors
which
have
a
common
nature
and
therefore
common
duties
you
are
also
dealing
with
two
known
and
analysable
organic
things
you
are
also
dealing
with
two
sets
of
wills
and
these
wills
we
know
to
be
free
in
spite
of
sophists
a
man
and
a
group
of
men
can
do
well
or
ill
both
absolutely
and
relatively
to
some
particular
question
in
hand
and
no
group
of
men
can
escape
responsibility
in
relation
to
any
other
group
with
which
it
is
in
contact
it
is
certain
that
we
play
a
part
ourselves
in
this
quarrel
between
us
and
the
jews
it
is
a
part
which
is
in
a
measure
inevitable
because
it
proceeds
in
a
measure
from
the
mere
contrast
between
two
racial
characters
but
there
is
a
remaining
part
which
can
be
remedied
by
the
action
of
the
will
though
we
can
not
change
that
element
which
is
inherent
in
our
nature
any
more
than
the
jews
can
change
theirs
yet
an
understanding
of
it
makes
all
the
difference
and
we
can
certainly
change
those
elements
which
are
inherent
in
our
wills
the
proof
of
this
is
that
in
the
long
story
of
the
relations
between
the
two
races
there
have
been
in
various
times
and
places
those
exceptional
chapters
of
calm
to
which
i
have
alluded
on
an
earlier
page
and
these
could
not
have
been
maintained
had
not
the
causes
of
friction
been
modified
on
either
side
but
especially
upon
ours
all
that
cause
of
friction
which
arises
from
the
mere
contrast
of
character
may
be
set
down
very
briefly
it
is
included
in
what
has
just
been
said
on
the
general
causes
the
difference
in
nature
between
the
jews
and
ourselves
if
their
form
of
courage
their
form
of
generosity
their
form
of
loyalty
is
as
it
is
of
a
different
quality
from
ours
if
their
defects
show
the
same
difference
of
quality
or
colour
if
we
perpetually
feel
as
we
do
feel
the
friction
caused
by
this
contrast
so
do
they
presumably
feel
a
corresponding
friction
in
their
dealings
with
us
we
shall
neither
of
us
be
able
to
change
that
state
of
affairs
we
must
admit
it
and
we
must
try
to
understand
its
nature
above
all
we
must
not
take
it
for
granted
that
a
difference
from
ourselves
is
in
itself
an
evil
in
another
that
is
a
point
to
be
insisted
upon
when
we
are
dealing
with
inanimate
nature
or
with
unintelligent
animate
nature
we
do
not
ascribe
motive
for
there
is
no
motive
to
ascribe
a
man
does
not
go
about
with
bitterness
in
his
heart
against
wasps
though
the
purpose
of
the
wasp
is
very
different
from
the
purpose
of
the
man
and
their
interests
clash
he
does
not
call
the
wasp
wicked
nor
save
as
a
relief
to
his
feelings
give
it
moral
names
he
does
not
condemn
the
wasp
still
less
does
he
condemn
all
wasps
or
anything
else
in
nature
around
him
that
works
against
his
interest
but
when
he
has
to
deal
with
other
human
beings
man
at
once
begins
to
ascribe
a
motive
he
must
do
so
because
he
knows
that
motive
is
the
spring
of
all
human
action
including
his
own
when
that
motive
differs
from
his
contrasts
with
his
and
is
therefore
in
any
degree
inimical
to
his
he
is
inclined
to
ascribe
an
evil
motive
all
that
is
a
truism
as
old
as
the
hills
if
you
have
not
to
live
with
those
who
thus
differ
from
you
there
is
no
great
harm
done
but
if
you
have
to
accept
them
as
part
of
your
life
it
is
a
different
matter
it
is
then
essential
to
the
order
of
the
state
that
this
illusion
of
directly
antagonistic
motive
should
be
watched
and
restrained
but
all
this
concerns
rather
our
duty
in
the
matter
than
the
mere
cause
of
friction
the
first
cause
of
friction
is
that
contrast
which
is
the
same
whether
we
describe
it
from
the
alien
point
of
view
as
has
just
been
done
or
from
our
own
the
causes
of
friction
which
lie
within
the
province
of
the
will
and
which
are
therefore
directly
a
matter
for
reform
are
of
another
kind
the
first
of
them
undoubtedly
is
our
in
our
dealings
with
the
jew
this
disingenuousness
extends
from
our
daily
habit
to
our
treatment
of
history
it
is
more
than
most
people
are
aware
of
more
widespread
than
those
who
are
aware
of
it
like
to
admit
it
affects
our
relations
with
the
jews
just
as
much
when
we
are
attempting
to
defend
their
position
in
the
state
as
when
we
attack
them
indeed
i
think
it
affects
our
relations
more
when
we
are
trying
to
defend
them
than
when
we
attack
them
the
only
two
kinds
of
men
who
show
perfect
candour
in
their
dealings
with
the
jews
are
the
completely
ignorant
dupe
who
can
hardly
tell
a
jew
when
he
sees
one
and
who
accepts
as
a
reality
the
old
fiction
of
there
being
no
difference
except
a
difference
of
religion
which
he
has
been
taught
to
think
unimportant
and
the
person
called
an
both
these
types
certainly
say
what
they
think
that
is
why
in
their
heart
of
hearts
the
jews
are
grateful
to
both
although
both
are
intellectually
contemptible
the
jew
feels
i
think
when
he
meets
either
of
these
types
at
any
rate
i
know
where
i
am
but
the
great
bulk
of
men
especially
among
the
more
cultivated
are
grossly
disingenuous
in
all
their
dealings
with
the
jews
it
is
the
great
fault
of
our
side
which
corresponds
to
the
fault
of
secrecy
upon
theirs
and
when
you
have
allowed
for
routine
for
the
necessities
of
social
intercourse
for
convention
and
the
rest
it
remains
a
deliberately
conceived
moral
evil
a
man
and
his
friend
meet
in
the
street
a
jew
whom
they
know
they
exchange
ordinary
civilities
with
him
they
pass
on
the
moment
his
back
is
turned
each
comments
to
his
companion
upon
the
jewish
character
of
the
man
they
have
just
left
and
almost
invariably
to
his
disadvantage
now
to
blame
this
way
of
going
on
does
not
imply
that
when
you
meet
your
jewish
acquaintance
you
are
to
offend
him
by
saying
to
his
face
the
kind
of
things
you
say
behind
his
back
that
would
be
a
monstrous
piece
of
cynicism
and
in
practice
insane
we
do
not
act
thus
in
any
relation
of
life
but
it
does
mean
that
in
the
attitude
the
gesture
the
tone
of
the
voice
we
play
a
deliberately
false
part
in
our
relations
with
jews
which
we
do
not
play
in
our
relations
with
any
other
people
a
peculiar
pretence
a
pretence
only
practised
with
jews
is
elaborately
maintained
there
is
no
allusion
to
or
admission
of
our
real
attitude
our
sense
of
contrast
we
therefore
suffer
an
unnatural
strain
and
we
relieve
of
the
strain
immediately
afterwards
by
an
exaggeration
of
the
contrast
we
have
pretended
to
ignore
it
is
blameworthy
in
a
special
degree
because
it
is
peculiar
to
that
one
case
if
we
admitted
the
jew
as
a
jew
talked
to
him
of
the
things
that
were
uppermost
in
his
mind
and
in
ours
and
treated
him
as
we
treat
any
other
foreigner
in
our
midst
there
would
have
been
no
harm
done
as
it
is
the
lie
has
done
a
double
harm
to
him
and
to
us
to
us
by
an
exasperation
which
is
entirely
our
own
fault
to
him
by
deceiving
him
as
to
his
true
position
the
jews
who
mix
with
the
wealthiest
classes
especially
in
london
have
no
true
idea
of
their
real
position
in
the
eyes
of
their
guests
and
the
fault
is
with
their
guests
i
have
cited
an
obvious
daily
example
but
it
is
the
least
important
for
it
is
passing
and
shallow
this
disingenuousness
spreads
to
relations
more
permanent
a
man
goes
into
business
with
a
jew
accepts
him
as
a
partner
works
with
him
constantly
and
yet
nourishes
in
his
heart
a
disloyalty
to
that
relationship
it
is
a
phenomenon
of
constant
recurrence
and
it
poisons
the
relations
between
the
two
races
if
a
man
is
prepared
to
enter
into
one
of
these
permanent
relations
with
another
man
who
differs
fundamentally
from
himself
in
tradition
and
human
character
he
must
face
the
consequences
one
of
those
consequences
if
he
is
to
remain
an
honest
man
is
the
acceptation
of
the
position
with
all
that
it
implies
he
can
not
have
the
advantage
as
he
hopes
to
have
it
of
the
jewish
sobriety
the
jewish
tenacity
the
jewish
lucidity
of
thought
the
jewish
international
relationships
the
jewish
opportunity
of
advancement
through
the
aid
of
his
fellows
and
at
the
same
time
secretly
indulge
in
a
contempt
and
dislike
for
his
companion
and
relieve
that
suppressed
feeling
in
his
absence
yet
that
is
what
men
are
doing
daily
throughout
the
business
world
listen
to
the
conversation
of
such
a
man
as
having
thus
engaged
in
intimate
commercial
relationship
with
the
jew
falls
upon
misfortune
he
spends
the
rest
of
his
life
denouncing
the
jews
as
a
race
and
his
own
companion
in
misfortune
in
particular
he
has
no
right
to
do
it
it
is
undignified
it
is
puerile
but
worst
of
all
it
is
unjust
he
presumably
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
entered
into
what
could
not
but
be
a
difficult
relationship
the
consequences
of
that
relationship
he
should
accept
whether
they
turn
out
well
for
him
or
we
find
something
perhaps
even
worse
to
note
in
the
attitude
of
those
who
are
successful
in
their
business
through
an
alliance
with
the
jew
for
in
this
case
gratitude
should
be
added
to
justice
and
that
gratitude
is
very
rarely
shown
on
the
contrary
the
partner
is
for
ever
in
a
mood
of
complaint
about
his
share
he
is
perpetually
in
a
grievance
that
he
has
been
overreached
or
that
he
has
been
bullied
or
that
he
has
been
robbed
save
in
those
very
rare
cases
where
the
success
is
so
overwhelming
the
fortunes
so
rapid
that
there
is
no
room
for
a
grudge
in
almost
every
other
case
that
i
have
come
across
there
is
that
element
of
recrimination
behind
the
jew
back
even
under
conditions
of
success
i
know
very
well
what
can
be
said
upon
the
other
side
it
can
be
said
that
what
i
have
called
upon
a
former
page
the
ruthlessness
of
the
jew
in
commercial
relations
as
well
as
his
tenacity
and
all
the
rest
make
the
contest
unequal
that
in
a
partnership
between
jew
and
the
is
as
a
fact
often
overreached
and
is
as
a
fact
often
left
as
the
pretty
vocabulary
of
modern
commerce
has
it
in
the
cart
but
pray
why
did
the
enter
into
the
alliance
at
all
was
it
not
precisely
in
order
that
he
should
benefit
if
he
could
by
those
very
qualities
which
he
later
denounces
he
expected
that
those
qualities
which
make
for
the
success
of
the
jew
in
commerce
would
also
benefit
himself
he
knew
that
there
must
always
be
a
certain
amount
of
competition
even
within
such
an
alliance
he
backed
himself
to
watch
his
own
interests
under
conditions
which
he
knew
perfectly
well
when
he
entered
into
them
he
has
not
a
leg
to
stand
upon
in
quarrelling
with
the
results
of
the
relationship
for
in
so
doing
he
is
merely
quarrelling
with
his
own
judgment
and
for
the
matter
of
that
his
own
plot
if
a
man
can
not
tolerate
the
contrast
between
the
jewish
race
and
our
own
or
if
he
regards
that
race
as
possessing
energies
which
will
invariably
defeat
him
in
the
competition
of
commerce
then
let
him
keep
away
from
a
jewish
alliance
altogether
it
is
the
simplest
plan
but
to
immix
himself
with
the
jewish
commercial
activity
and
then
to
grumble
at
the
results
is
despicable
all
this
is
worse
of
course
when
one
is
dealing
with
relations
even
closer
than
those
of
commerce
those
relations
are
numerous
in
the
modern
world
and
disingenuousness
in
them
takes
the
worst
possible
form
men
especially
of
the
wealthier
classes
of
the
gentry
will
make
the
closest
friends
of
jews
with
the
avowed
purpose
of
personal
advantage
they
think
the
friendship
will
help
them
to
great
positions
in
the
state
or
to
the
advancement
of
private
fortune
or
to
fame
in
that
calculation
they
are
wise
for
the
jew
has
exceptional
power
in
all
these
things
they
therefore
have
the
jew
continually
at
their
tables
they
stay
continually
under
the
jew
roof
in
all
the
relations
of
life
they
are
as
intimate
as
friends
can
be
yet
they
relieve
the
strain
which
such
an
unnatural
situation
imposes
by
a
standing
sneer
at
their
jewish
friends
in
their
absence
one
may
say
of
such
men
and
they
are
an
increasing
majority
among
our
rich
that
the
falsity
of
their
situation
has
got
on
their
nerves
it
has
become
a
sort
of
disease
with
them
and
i
am
very
certain
that
when
the
opportunity
comes
when
the
public
reaction
against
jewish
power
rises
clamorous
insistent
and
open
they
will
be
among
the
first
to
take
their
revenge
it
is
abominable
but
it
is
true
and
this
truth
applies
not
only
to
friendships
it
even
applies
to
marriages
marriage
between
christian
and
jew
is
in
that
rank
an
affair
of
interest
and
the
bitterness
the
relation
breeds
is
excessive
this
disingenuousness
then
lack
of
candour
on
the
part
of
our
race
in
its
dealings
with
the
jew
a
vice
particularly
rife
among
the
wealthy
and
middle
classes
far
less
common
among
the
poor
extends
as
i
have
said
to
history
we
dare
not
or
will
not
teach
in
our
history
books
the
plain
facts
of
the
relations
between
our
own
race
and
the
jews
we
throw
the
story
of
these
relations
which
are
among
the
leading
factors
of
history
right
into
the
background
even
when
we
do
mention
it
in
what
they
are
taught
of
history
the
schoolboy
and
the
undergraduate
come
across
no
more
than
a
line
or
two
upon
those
relations
the
teacher
can
not
be
quite
silent
upon
the
expulsion
of
the
jews
under
edward
i
or
upon
their
return
under
cromwell
a
man
can
not
read
the
history
of
the
roman
empire
without
hearing
of
the
jewish
war
a
man
can
not
read
the
constitutional
history
of
england
without
hearing
of
the
special
economic
position
of
jews
under
the
mediaeval
crown
but
the
vastness
of
the
subject
its
permanent
and
insistent
character
throughout
two
thousand
years
its
great
episodes
its
general
effect
all
that
is
deliberately
suppressed
how
many
people
for
instance
of
those
who
profess
a
good
knowledge
of
the
roman
empire
even
in
its
details
are
aware
let
alone
have
written
upon
the
tremendous
massacres
and
of
jews
and
europeans
the
mass
of
edicts
alternately
protecting
and
persecuting
jews
the
economic
position
of
the
jew
especially
in
the
later
empire
the
character
of
the
dispersion
there
took
place
in
cyprus
and
in
the
libyan
cities
under
hadrian
a
jewish
movement
against
the
surrounding
society
far
exceeding
in
violence
the
late
wreckage
of
russia
which
fills
all
our
thoughts
the
massacres
were
wholesale
and
so
were
the
reprisals
the
jews
killed
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
the
people
of
cyprus
alone
and
the
roman
authorities
answered
with
a
repression
which
was
a
pitiless
war
one
might
pile
up
instances
indefinitely
the
point
is
that
the
average
educated
man
has
never
been
allowed
to
hear
of
them
what
a
factor
the
jew
was
in
that
roman
state
from
which
we
all
spring
how
he
survived
its
violent
antagonism
to
him
and
his
antagonism
to
it
the
special
privilege
whereby
he
was
excepted
from
a
worship
of
its
gods
his
handling
of
its
finances
all
the
intimate
parallel
which
it
affords
to
later
times
is
left
in
silence
the
average
educated
man
who
has
been
taught
even
in
some
fullness
his
roman
history
leaves
that
study
with
the
impression
that
the
jews
if
he
had
noticed
them
at
all
are
but
an
insignificant
detail
in
the
story
so
it
is
with
history
more
recent
and
even
contemporaneous
in
the
history
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
is
outrageous
the
special
character
of
the
jew
his
actions
through
the
secret
societies
and
in
the
various
revolutions
of
foreign
states
his
rapid
acquisition
of
power
through
finance
political
and
social
especially
in
this
country
all
that
is
left
out
it
is
an
exact
parallel
to
the
disingenuousness
which
we
note
in
social
relations
the
same
man
who
shall
have
written
a
monograph
upon
some
point
of
nineteenth
century
history
and
left
his
readers
in
ignorance
of
the
jewish
elements
in
the
story
will
regale
you
in
private
with
a
dozen
anecdotes
a
man
was
a
jew
a
man
was
half
a
jew
another
was
controlled
in
his
policy
by
a
jewish
mistress
the
in
a
negotiation
was
a
jew
the
jewish
blood
in
a
family
came
in
thus
and
thus
and
so
forth
but
not
a
word
of
it
on
the
printed
page
this
deliberate
falsehood
equally
applies
to
contemporary
record
the
newspaper
reader
is
deceived
so
far
as
it
is
still
possible
to
deceive
him
with
the
most
shameless
lies
abraham
cohen
a
pole
mosevitch
a
distinguished
roumanian
schiff
and
other
representative
americans
bergson
with
his
typically
french
lucidity
maximilian
harden
always
courageous
in
his
criticism
of
his
people
his
being
the
german
and
the
rest
of
the
rubbish
it
is
weakening
i
admit
but
it
has
not
yet
ceased
now
this
form
of
falsehood
corrodes
of
course
the
souls
of
those
who
indulge
in
it
but
that
does
not
concern
the
matter
of
this
book
where
it
comes
in
as
a
cause
of
friction
between
the
two
races
and
a
removable
cause
of
friction
is
in
the
effect
it
has
upon
the
jewish
conception
of
their
position
in
our
society
it
falsifies
that
conception
altogether
it
produces
in
the
jew
a
false
sense
of
security
and
a
completely
distorted
phantasm
of
the
way
in
which
he
is
really
received
in
our
society
the
more
this
disingenuousness
is
practised
the
more
the
surprise
which
follows
upon
its
discovery
and
the
more
legitimate
the
bitterness
and
hatred
which
that
surprise
occasions
in
those
of
whom
we
are
the
hosts
it
is
not
only
true
of
this
country
it
is
true
of
every
other
country
in
which
the
jew
has
been
harboured
and
for
a
time
protected
invariably
he
has
complained
that
his
awakening
was
rude
that
he
was
bewildered
by
what
seemed
to
him
a
novel
and
inexplicable
feeling
against
him
that
he
had
thought
he
was
among
friends
and
found
himself
suddenly
among
treacherous
enemies
all
this
would
have
been
saved
to
others
in
the
past
and
will
be
saved
to
ourselves
in
the
near
future
if
this
pestilent
habit
of
falsehood
were
eliminated
disingenuousness
is
on
our
side
the
first
main
cause
of
the
friction
between
the
two
races
the
second
main
cause
of
friction
upon
our
side
is
the
unintelligence
of
our
dealing
with
the
jews
that
unintelligence
is
allied
of
course
to
the
disingenuousness
of
which
i
have
spoken
but
it
is
a
separate
thing
none
the
less
and
we
can
learn
from
the
jews
its
opposite
for
dealings
with
are
always
intelligent
they
know
what
they
are
driving
at
in
those
relations
though
they
often
misunderstand
the
material
with
which
they
deal
but
we
over
and
over
again
would
seem
not
even
to
know
what
we
are
driving
at
what
could
be
more
unintelligent
for
instance
than
the
special
forms
of
courtesy
with
which
the
jew
is
treated
i
am
not
talking
of
the
elaborate
false
friendship
which
i
have
just
dealt
with
under
the
head
of
disingenuousness
but
of
the
genuine
attempts
at
courtesy
towards
this
alien
people
the
courtesy
expressed
by
those
who
have
no
intimate
relations
with
them
and
do
not
desire
to
have
intimate
relations
with
them
it
is
almost
invariably
in
those
who
commonly
avoid
the
jews
a
courtesy
which
expresses
patronage
on
the
surface
of
it
it
may
be
compared
with
the
courtesy
that
rich
men
show
to
poor
men
as
offensive
a
thing
as
there
is
in
the
world
and
how
unintelligent
is
our
dealing
with
any
particular
jewish
problem
for
instance
the
problem
of
jewish
immigration
we
mask
it
under
false
names
calling
it
the
alien
question
russian
immigration
the
influx
of
undesirables
from
eastern
and
central
europe
and
any
number
of
other
timorous
equivalents
the
process
is
one
of
cowardly
falsehood
but
the
falsehood
is
not
more
remarkable
than
the
stupidity
for
no
one
is
taken
in
and
least
of
all
the
jews
themselves
this
unintelligence
extends
to
many
another
field
how
unintelligent
are
the
efforts
of
the
writers
who
would
as
it
were
make
amends
to
the
jews
for
former
persecution
by
putting
imaginary
jew
heroes
into
their
books
in
this
particular
we
offend
less
than
did
our
fathers
of
the
victorian
period
dickens
offence
was
grave
he
disliked
jews
instinctively
when
he
wrote
of
a
jew
according
to
his
inclination
he
made
him
out
a
criminal
hearing
that
he
must
make
amends
for
this
action
he
introduced
a
jew
who
is
like
nothing
on
earth
a
sort
of
compound
of
an
arab
sheik
and
a
family
bible
picture
from
the
old
testament
and
the
whole
embroidered
on
an
utterly
a
purely
english
character
how
unintelligent
are
the
various
defences
of
the
jew
by
the
even
with
the
best
intentions
you
will
hear
people
tell
you
solemnly
as
a
sort
of
revelation
that
there
are
kindly
witty
jews
jews
who
are
good
or
good
fencers
i
well
remember
one
old
gentleman
who
tried
hard
to
convince
me
as
though
i
needed
convincing
that
there
were
jews
who
had
taste
he
said
to
me
i
do
not
myself
go
into
jewish
houses
but
my
son
does
and
he
assures
me
that
much
of
the
decoration
is
in
good
taste
how
unintelligent
is
the
idea
that
because
a
motives
are
not
open
and
because
he
has
not
the
same
reasons
for
serving
the
state
that
you
have
he
is
to
be
perpetually
under
suspicion
how
still
more
unintelligent
is
the
conception
that
although
he
is
alien
yet
you
can
not
use
him
in
certain
special
services
for
the
state
this
unintelligence
is
specially
apparent
in
the
treatment
of
the
jew
in
his
international
relations
the
jew
is
a
nomad
the
a
man
with
a
fixed
habitation
the
englishman
the
frenchman
and
the
rest
are
perpetually
approaching
the
jew
as
though
he
also
had
a
fixed
habitation
we
seem
never
to
be
able
to
get
over
the
shock
of
surprise
when
we
learn
that
a
particular
jew
abroad
is
the
cousin
or
nephew
or
brother
of
another
jew
with
a
different
name
in
england
or
with
another
jew
with
yet
another
name
in
pinsk
or
san
francisco
yet
surely
this
is
of
the
very
essence
of
the
jewish
position
we
ought
to
take
it
for
granted
that
the
jew
is
thus
nomadic
international
spread
all
over
the
world
migratory
as
we
take
the
same
thing
for
granted
in
birds
of
passage
to
adopt
the
attitude
which
we
almost
invariably
do
and
to
feel
a
shock
of
surprise
when
we
discover
what
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
the
most
regular
feature
in
the
civic
situation
of
the
jew
is
to
fall
into
that
most
stupid
of
all
stupid
errors
the
reading
of
oneself
into
others
i
remember
the
horror
and
scandal
with
which
men
whispered
their
discovery
that
a
man
with
a
german
name
who
had
got
into
trouble
a
few
years
ago
was
the
first
cousin
of
a
cabinet
minister
why
not
they
seemed
to
be
struck
all
of
a
heap
by
the
dreadful
revelation
that
the
names
borne
by
jews
were
not
always
their
original
names
that
rich
and
important
men
often
have
poor
relations
and
that
poor
relations
often
get
embarrassed
in
terms
of
their
own
society
the
thing
would
have
been
simple
enough
they
would
have
felt
no
surprise
to
hear
that
some
man
of
our
own
race
who
had
made
a
rapid
fortune
and
purchased
a
political
position
suffered
from
a
disreputable
relative
also
of
our
own
race
but
because
in
the
case
of
the
jew
there
were
the
two
unusual
elements
of
a
foreign
name
and
distant
origin
they
were
bewildered
they
even
thought
it
in
some
way
specially
scandalous
they
had
not
appreciated
the
material
with
which
they
were
dealing
and
that
is
the
mark
of
unintelligence
but
the
cream
of
unintelligence
the
form
in
which
unintelligent
treatment
of
him
most
exasperates
the
jew
is
undoubtedly
that
typical
that
ceaseless
case
of
the
man
who
is
perpetually
crying
out
against
israel
and
purposing
nothing
the
man
who
nourishes
a
sterile
grievance
who
has
not
even
the
clarity
or
vigour
to
attempt
suppression
who
would
be
horrified
at
persecution
almost
equally
horrified
at
any
breach
of
convention
and
yet
continues
to
cry
out
against
a
state
of
affairs
which
he
does
nothing
to
put
right
and
for
which
he
has
not
even
a
theoretic
solution
the
last
of
the
main
causes
of
friction
between
the
jews
and
ourselves
is
lack
of
charity
and
that
in
the
simplest
form
of
refusing
to
go
half
way
to
meet
the
jew
and
of
refusing
to
put
ourselves
in
the
shoes
of
the
jew
so
as
to
understand
his
position
in
our
society
and
his
attitude
towards
it
it
is
a
universal
fault
just
as
common
in
those
who
daily
associate
with
live
off
and
fawn
upon
jews
as
in
those
who
keep
aloof
from
them
it
never
seems
to
occur
to
anyone
on
our
side
who
has
to
deal
with
the
jewish
problem
to
make
the
imaginative
effort
required
and
yet
we
have
the
parallel
ready
to
our
hands
the
jew
feels
among
us
only
with
far
greater
intensity
what
we
feel
when
we
are
resident
in
a
foreign
country
a
sense
of
exile
a
sense
of
irritation
against
alien
things
merely
because
they
are
alien
a
great
desire
for
companionship
and
for
understanding
yet
a
great
indifference
to
the
fate
of
those
among
whom
he
finds
himself
an
added
attachment
not
indeed
to
his
territorial
home
for
he
has
none
but
to
his
nation
if
we
could
perpetually
bear
in
mind
that
parallel
the
friction
on
our
side
would
be
greatly
modified
there
are
many
jewish
societies
which
ask
nothing
better
than
to
have
occasional
addresses
from
those
addresses
are
given
those
societies
are
visited
but
not
nearly
as
much
as
they
should
be
there
is
a
great
jewish
literature
i
mean
a
great
mass
of
books
dealing
specially
with
the
jew
position
from
the
jew
own
point
of
view
it
is
not
read
or
known
i
may
be
told
that
the
fault
of
all
this
is
largely
that
of
the
jews
themselves
on
account
of
their
use
of
secrecy
i
do
not
think
the
objection
applies
with
all
his
use
of
secrecy
the
jew
is
there
present
among
us
for
us
to
approach
if
we
will
and
to
understand
as
best
we
can
and
i
say
that
the
approach
is
not
made
it
is
an
effort
of
course
no
one
knows
it
better
than
i
for
on
more
than
one
occasion
when
i
have
addressed
a
jewish
audience
i
have
found
myself
the
object
of
very
severe
language
but
it
is
an
effort
which
every
one
ought
to
make
who
admits
that
there
is
a
jewish
problem
at
all
and
it
is
an
effort
very
rarely
made
it
is
not
only
an
effort
because
it
involves
the
crossing
of
a
gulf
it
is
also
an
effort
because
we
find
this
alien
thing
in
many
ways
repugnant
to
us
yet
people
make
that
effort
for
the
purposes
of
the
state
continually
where
other
races
are
concerned
it
is
far
more
important
that
they
should
make
it
where
the
jews
are
concerned
for
those
other
alien
races
administrated
for
the
moment
by
officials
of
our
own
race
will
not
permanently
be
so
administered
the
relations
between
them
and
us
are
for
a
brief
time
and
they
are
relations
that
constantly
change
the
jew
is
with
us
always
and
the
type
of
contact
between
his
race
and
ours
will
remain
much
the
same
through
an
indefinitely
long
future
as
they
have
through
so
very
long
a
past
here
then
is
the
summary
as
i
see
it
of
the
causes
of
friction
between
the
two
races
first
a
general
cause
which
lies
in
the
contrasting
nature
of
the
two
and
upon
the
irritant
effect
of
that
contrast
this
cause
is
not
to
be
eliminated
though
its
effects
may
be
modified
it
is
a
profound
contrast
and
a
sharp
irritant
constant
in
its
activity
the
essential
is
to
recognize
its
real
nature
not
to
give
to
it
general
terms
of
faults
and
vices
but
to
appreciate
the
difference
of
involved
above
all
not
to
tell
lies
about
it
and
pretend
it
is
not
present
secondly
as
to
special
causes
of
friction
i
mean
causes
which
on
their
side
as
on
ours
can
be
if
not
eliminated
at
any
rate
modified
i
suggest
that
the
most
prominent
are
the
sense
of
superiority
which
though
it
can
not
be
destroyed
can
at
least
be
checked
in
expression
and
which
by
a
pretty
irony
is
equally
strong
upon
both
sides
the
use
of
secrecy
by
the
jews
themselves
partly
as
a
weapon
of
defence
partly
as
a
method
of
action
always
to
be
deplored
and
of
a
nature
particularly
exasperating
to
our
temperament
upon
our
side
a
persistent
disingenuousness
in
our
treatment
of
this
minority
unintelligence
in
their
treatment
the
whole
made
worse
by
an
indifference
or
lack
of
charity
a
refusal
to
make
the
effort
necessary
for
meeting
and
understanding
as
well
as
we
can
the
race
which
must
always
be
with
us
and
which
is
yet
so
different
from
our
own
now
these
causes
of
friction
permanently
present
tend
to
produce
what
i
have
called
the
tragic
cycle
welcome
of
a
jewish
colony
then
followed
by
acute
followed
by
persecution
exile
and
even
massacre
this
followed
naturally
by
a
reaction
and
the
taking
up
of
the
process
all
over
again
in
our
own
time
we
have
seen
quite
lately
the
succession
of
the
second
to
the
first
of
these
stages
we
have
passed
from
welcome
to
that
passage
threatens
a
further
passage
from
the
second
to
the
third
from
the
third
to
the
terrible
conclusion
we
feel
quite
secure
from
the
last
extreme
of
this
cycle
we
are
certain
it
will
never
come
to
persecution
that
is
still
inconceivable
but
it
is
not
inconceivable
everywhere
and
no
society
is
free
from
change
some
now
alive
may
live
to
see
riots
even
in
this
quiet
polity
and
worse
in
newer
or
less
settled
states
such
a
catastrophe
is
to
be
avoided
by
every
effort
in
our
power
and
a
solution
to
the
problem
presented
must
imperatively
be
sought
but
in
passing
we
should
note
for
the
consideration
of
those
who
may
doubt
the
acuteness
of
the
problem
and
the
immediate
practical
necessity
for
a
solution
the
presence
of
a
phenomenon
which
amply
proves
that
it
acute
and
that
the
solution
necessary
that
phenomenon
is
the
presence
of
a
new
type
the
the
man
to
whom
all
the
jews
are
abhorrent
it
is
a
phenomenon
which
has
increased
prodigiously
its
rate
of
increase
is
accelerating
and
as
a
warning
of
the
peril
as
a
proof
of
its
magnitude
i
propose
to
examine
that
phenomenon
closely
in
my
next
chapter
the
chapter
vii
the
to
understand
any
problem
one
must
study
not
only
its
real
factors
as
they
appear
to
a
reasonable
man
who
sees
the
whole
affair
steadily
one
must
also
understand
the
insanities
and
distortions
the
problem
has
provoked
for
they
singularly
illustrate
its
character
and
force
it
is
not
enough
to
consider
only
the
actual
in
any
difficulty
to
be
solved
it
is
necessary
also
to
consider
the
imaginary
because
the
legend
or
illusion
is
a
direct
product
of
the
truth
and
shows
how
the
truth
has
acted
on
other
minds
thus
a
caricature
brings
out
what
we
unconsciously
know
to
be
present
in
any
personality
emphasizes
it
and
though
false
in
its
exaggeration
forbids
us
to
forget
it
in
the
future
thus
any
extreme
no
matter
how
false
its
lack
of
proportion
is
of
the
highest
value
to
judgment
in
a
practical
problem
of
politics
there
is
another
most
weighty
reason
for
examining
extreme
and
distorted
opinion
which
is
that
in
politics
we
deal
not
only
with
real
things
but
with
the
liking
or
disliking
of
these
things
by
living
men
their
exaggerated
or
affection
or
repulsion
all
statesmanship
lies
in
the
apprehension
of
enthusiasm
and
indifference
now
there
are
in
this
great
political
problem
presented
by
the
jewish
race
in
our
midst
two
extremes
one
we
have
already
studied
it
is
the
extreme
folly
of
falsehood
of
pretending
that
the
problem
is
not
there
that
extreme
was
an
almost
universal
folly
in
the
immediate
past
especially
in
this
country
it
is
now
abandoned
by
all
of
our
generation
save
a
few
people
of
an
official
sort
and
these
will
not
long
maintain
an
attitude
outworn
and
already
ridiculous
but
the
other
extreme
remains
to
be
studied
it
is
in
our
society
quite
a
recent
phenomenon
though
it
has
gained
very
great
strength
in
recent
years
and
is
increasing
alarmingly
it
is
the
extreme
of
hatred
it
is
the
extreme
manifested
by
those
who
have
but
one
motive
in
their
action
towards
the
jewish
race
and
that
motive
a
mere
desire
for
its
elimination
it
implies
that
there
is
no
peace
possible
between
the
two
races
no
reasoned
political
solution
it
relies
upon
nothing
but
antagonism
it
is
already
very
strong
and
its
adherents
believe
themselves
to
be
on
the
eve
of
a
sort
of
blundering
triumph
every
one
who
desires
to
deal
with
this
grave
political
matter
practically
that
is
to
establish
a
permanent
policy
will
be
much
more
concerned
with
the
extreme
here
examined
than
with
the
other
extreme
which
ignores
the
problem
altogether
for
this
new
extreme
of
active
hatred
is
flourishing
that
other
older
extreme
no
longer
functions
the
near
future
will
have
to
deal
in
practical
politics
not
only
with
the
problem
presented
by
the
jews
as
an
alien
power
within
the
state
but
what
will
probably
prove
a
more
difficult
matter
with
the
hater
of
the
jew
who
is
claiming
and
rapidly
achieving
power
on
his
side
the
type
is
as
old
as
the
problem
it
is
two
thousand
years
old
but
it
waxes
and
wanes
its
modern
name
of
is
as
ridiculous
in
derivation
as
it
is
ludicrous
in
form
it
is
partly
of
german
academic
origin
and
partly
a
newspaper
name
vulgar
as
one
would
expect
it
to
be
from
such
an
origin
and
also
as
falsely
pedantic
as
one
would
expect
but
the
exasperated
mood
of
which
it
is
a
label
is
very
real
i
say
the
word
is
vulgar
and
pedantic
that
i
think
will
be
universally
admitted
it
is
also
nonsensical
the
antagonism
to
the
jews
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
supposed
semitic
race
which
probably
does
not
exist
any
more
than
do
many
other
modern
hypothetical
abstractions
and
which
anyhow
does
not
come
into
the
matter
the
is
not
a
man
who
hates
the
modern
arabs
or
the
ancient
carthaginians
he
is
a
man
who
hates
jews
however
we
must
accept
the
word
because
it
has
become
currency
and
go
on
to
the
more
essential
matter
of
discovering
how
those
to
whom
it
applies
are
moved
what
the
result
of
their
action
would
be
if
or
when
they
could
act
freely
and
most
important
of
all
of
what
they
are
a
sign
the
is
a
man
marked
by
two
main
characters
in
the
first
place
he
hates
the
jews
his
motive
is
not
a
hatred
of
their
presence
in
our
society
his
motive
is
not
the
hatred
of
concealment
falsehood
hypocrisy
corruption
and
all
the
other
incidental
evils
of
that
false
position
these
things
indeed
irritate
him
but
they
are
not
his
leading
motive
his
leading
motive
is
a
hatred
of
the
jewish
people
he
is
in
intense
reaction
against
this
alien
thing
which
he
perceives
to
have
acquired
so
much
power
in
his
society
the
way
in
which
it
has
exercised
this
power
especially
exasperates
him
but
he
will
remain
a
hater
of
the
jewish
nation
when
they
are
despised
insignificant
and
neglected
and
he
will
remain
a
hater
of
it
even
if
there
be
then
attached
to
its
position
no
accidents
of
secrecy
falsehood
and
financial
corruption
the
type
increases
rapidly
when
jews
have
power
it
becomes
almost
universal
when
they
begin
to
abuse
that
power
it
dwindles
as
that
power
declines
but
it
is
always
the
same
and
is
an
index
of
peril
the
is
a
man
who
to
get
rid
of
the
he
is
filled
with
an
instinctive
feeling
in
the
matter
he
detests
the
jew
as
a
jew
and
would
detest
him
wherever
he
found
him
the
evidences
of
such
a
state
of
mind
are
familiar
to
us
all
the
admires
for
instance
a
work
of
art
on
finding
its
author
to
be
a
jew
it
becomes
distasteful
to
him
though
the
work
remains
exactly
what
it
was
before
the
will
confuse
the
action
of
any
particular
jew
with
his
general
odium
for
the
race
he
will
hardly
admit
high
talents
in
his
adversaries
or
if
he
admits
them
he
will
always
see
in
their
expression
something
distorted
and
unsavoury
when
an
accusation
is
made
against
a
jew
he
can
not
adopt
the
judicial
attitude
any
more
than
could
that
other
extremist
the
humbug
who
denies
the
jewish
problem
altogether
just
as
that
other
person
now
passing
out
of
our
lives
would
not
admit
a
jew
to
be
guilty
under
the
most
glaring
evidence
and
was
particularly
unable
to
admit
guilt
in
a
jew
who
might
be
wealthy
just
as
he
proclaimed
the
jews
as
a
whole
impeccable
so
does
the
approach
every
jew
with
a
presumption
of
his
probable
guilt
so
does
he
exaggerate
this
prejudice
when
he
has
to
deal
with
a
wealthy
jew
and
so
does
he
consider
the
whole
jewish
race
in
the
lump
as
probably
guilty
of
pretty
well
any
charge
brought
against
it
the
contrast
was
very
well
seen
in
the
dreyfus
case
when
the
old
type
of
extremist
was
still
strong
he
would
not
look
at
the
evidence
against
dreyfus
he
would
not
if
he
could
help
it
mention
his
race
all
he
knew
was
that
dreyfus
was
and
must
in
the
nature
of
things
be
innocent
and
that
all
the
diverse
men
who
testified
against
him
were
wicked
conspirators
the
new
type
of
extremist
then
but
rising
and
not
yet
master
would
not
listen
to
the
strong
evidence
in
dreyfus
favour
refused
to
the
case
after
the
chief
witness
had
been
found
guilty
of
forgery
made
up
his
mind
that
dreyfus
was
necessarily
guilty
and
was
convinced
that
all
his
supporters
were
dupes
or
knaves
the
mere
fact
that
the
jews
exist
let
alone
that
they
are
powerful
poisons
life
for
such
a
man
he
is
led
by
his
enthusiasm
into
the
most
ridiculous
errors
in
this
country
every
name
of
german
origin
at
once
suggests
a
jew
to
him
every
financial
operation
especially
if
it
be
of
doubtful
morality
must
certainly
have
a
jew
behind
it
wherever
a
number
of
partners
jewish
and
are
engaged
in
some
bad
work
as
for
instance
in
one
of
our
innumerable
parliamentary
scandals
a
jew
must
always
for
this
sort
of
person
be
the
prime
mover
and
the
evil
genius
of
the
whole
as
is
the
case
with
every
other
mania
this
mania
rapidly
obscures
the
general
vision
of
its
victim
his
prejudices
soon
lose
proportion
altogether
he
comes
to
see
the
jew
in
everything
and
everywhere
and
to
accept
confidently
propositions
which
he
would
himself
see
to
be
contradictory
could
he
give
a
moment
quiet
thought
to
the
matter
thus
i
have
heard
on
all
sides
in
the
last
few
years
these
strange
assertions
proceeding
from
the
same
source
yet
obviously
incompatible
one
with
the
other
that
modern
scepticism
was
jewish
in
its
origin
that
modern
superstition
our
modern
necromancy
and
crystal
gazing
and
all
the
rest
of
it
was
jewish
in
its
origin
that
the
evils
of
democracy
are
all
jewish
in
their
origin
that
the
evil
of
tyrannical
government
in
prussia
for
instance
was
jewish
in
its
origin
that
the
pagan
perversions
of
bad
modern
art
were
jewish
in
their
origin
that
the
puerility
of
bad
church
furniture
was
due
to
jewish
dealers
that
the
great
war
was
the
product
of
jewish
armament
firms
that
the
appeals
which
weakened
the
allied
armies
came
from
jewish
sources
and
so
on
it
is
indeed
true
that
there
is
a
jewish
quality
in
all
these
diverse
and
contradictory
things
where
a
jew
mixes
in
them
just
as
there
is
a
scotch
or
french
or
english
quality
when
a
scot
a
frenchman
or
an
englishman
is
the
agent
but
to
ascribe
the
whole
boiling
to
the
jew
and
to
make
him
the
conscious
origin
of
all
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
the
is
a
man
so
absorbed
in
his
subject
that
he
at
last
loses
interest
in
any
matter
unless
he
can
give
it
some
association
with
his
delusion
for
delusion
it
is
in
a
sense
of
course
this
state
of
mind
is
a
sort
of
compliment
to
the
jewish
nation
if
such
a
preoccupation
with
them
be
not
amicable
it
is
at
least
intense
and
those
against
whom
it
is
directed
may
well
regard
it
as
a
proof
of
their
importance
in
the
world
but
that
aspect
of
the
phenomenon
is
not
consoling
for
the
future
of
either
of
us
the
jew
who
now
nervously
awaits
attack
and
we
who
desire
to
forestall
and
prevent
such
attack
the
is
very
much
more
numerous
and
very
much
more
powerful
than
might
be
imagined
from
the
reading
of
the
daily
press
for
the
press
is
still
for
the
most
part
under
the
convention
of
ignoring
the
jewish
problem
and
under
the
terror
of
the
financial
results
which
might
follow
from
a
discussion
of
it
his
universal
activity
is
not
yet
to
be
read
of
in
the
great
newspapers
but
in
conversation
and
in
the
practice
of
daily
life
we
hear
of
it
everywhere
and
here
i
may
digress
upon
a
modern
feature
which
applies
to
all
political
problems
and
therefore
to
this
jewish
problem
among
others
the
great
movements
of
our
time
have
never
in
the
press
of
the
great
cities
they
rise
and
store
up
their
energies
in
political
cliques
in
popular
gatherings
and
spoken
rumours
long
before
they
appear
in
this
main
instrument
for
the
spreading
of
news
that
is
because
the
press
of
our
great
cities
is
controlled
by
very
few
men
whose
object
is
not
the
discussion
of
public
affairs
still
less
the
giving
of
full
information
to
their
but
the
piling
up
of
private
fortune
as
these
men
are
not
as
a
rule
educated
men
nor
particularly
concerned
with
the
fortunes
of
the
state
nor
capable
of
understanding
from
the
past
what
the
future
may
be
they
will
never
take
up
a
great
movement
until
it
is
forced
upon
them
on
the
contrary
they
will
waste
energy
in
getting
up
false
excitement
upon
insignificant
matters
where
they
feel
safe
and
even
in
using
their
instruments
for
the
advertisement
of
their
own
insignificant
lives
in
all
this
the
modern
press
of
our
great
cities
differs
very
greatly
from
the
press
of
a
lifetime
ago
it
was
not
always
owned
by
educated
men
but
it
was
conducted
by
highly
educated
men
who
were
given
a
free
hand
it
therefore
concerned
itself
with
problems
of
real
importance
and
it
debated
upon
either
side
real
contrasts
of
opinion
upon
those
matters
this
modern
press
of
ours
does
none
of
these
things
but
precisely
because
it
is
so
reluctant
to
express
real
emotion
it
does
when
the
emotion
is
forced
upon
it
let
it
out
in
a
flood
just
as
it
would
not
tell
the
truth
when
a
thing
was
growing
so
when
it
reaches
an
extreme
it
will
not
exercise
restraint
on
the
contrary
if
the
stunt
be
an
exciting
one
it
will
push
it
once
it
has
made
up
its
mind
to
talk
of
it
at
all
in
the
most
extreme
form
and
to
the
last
pitch
of
violence
we
have
seen
that
plainly
enough
in
the
monstrous
expressions
of
foreign
policy
during
the
last
ten
years
and
we
have
seen
it
in
the
abominable
hounding
of
individuals
to
which
that
same
press
has
lent
itself
now
in
the
matter
of
feeling
we
shall
have
i
think
exactly
the
same
phenomenon
repeated
that
feeling
is
now
ubiquitous
it
is
spreading
with
an
alarming
rapidity
and
the
increase
of
its
intensity
is
even
more
remarkable
than
the
increase
in
the
numbers
of
its
adherents
sooner
or
later
and
fairly
soon
i
imagine
the
press
will
give
it
voice
when
it
it
will
give
it
voice
we
may
be
certain
in
the
most
extreme
the
most
passionate
the
most
irrational
form
and
when
that
happens
in
a
field
where
passion
is
already
so
wild
god
help
its
victims
the
passion
largely
based
though
it
is
on
imaginary
things
has
adopted
one
method
of
action
highly
practical
it
is
a
method
of
action
closely
in
touch
with
reality
and
productive
of
formidable
results
i
mean
compiling
of
it
has
here
noted
all
over
europe
and
america
with
exactitude
and
continues
to
put
upon
record
everything
which
can
be
said
to
the
detriment
of
its
victims
it
discovered
at
its
origin
presented
as
a
barrier
against
it
the
jewish
weapon
of
secrecy
the
folly
of
the
jews
in
using
such
a
weapon
was
never
better
shown
for
of
all
defences
it
is
the
easiest
to
break
down
the
countered
at
once
by
making
every
inquiry
by
collecting
their
information
by
finding
out
and
exposing
the
true
names
hidden
under
the
mask
of
false
ones
by
detecting
and
registering
the
relationships
between
men
who
pretended
ignorance
one
of
the
other
it
ferreted
all
through
the
ramifications
of
anonymous
finance
and
invariably
caught
the
jew
who
was
behind
the
great
industrial
insurance
schemes
the
jew
who
was
behind
such
and
such
a
metal
monopoly
the
jew
who
was
behind
such
and
such
a
news
agency
the
jew
who
financed
such
and
such
a
politician
that
formidable
library
of
exposure
spreads
daily
and
when
the
opportunity
for
general
publication
is
given
there
will
be
no
answer
to
it
it
is
the
greatest
mistake
in
the
world
to
regard
the
in
the
vast
numerical
strength
he
has
now
attained
all
over
our
civilization
as
wholly
unpractical
and
therefore
negligible
as
a
man
who
can
not
construct
a
formidable
plan
of
action
simply
because
he
has
lost
his
sense
of
values
while
the
movement
was
growing
the
method
of
meeting
it
was
always
that
of
ridicule
it
was
a
false
method
the
strength
of
was
and
is
based
not
only
on
intensity
of
feeling
but
also
on
industry
an
industry
very
accurate
in
its
methods
the
pamphlets
newspapers
and
books
which
the
great
daily
press
is
so
careful
to
boycott
form
by
now
a
mass
of
information
upon
the
whole
jewish
problem
which
is
already
overwhelming
and
still
mounting
up
and
all
of
it
hostile
to
the
jews
you
will
not
find
in
it
of
course
any
material
for
the
defendant
brief
but
as
a
for
the
prosecution
it
is
astonishing
in
extent
and
accuracy
and
correlation
now
it
is
to
be
remembered
in
this
connection
that
the
human
mind
is
influenced
by
documentation
in
a
special
manner
the
exact
citation
of
demonstrable
things
with
chapter
and
verse
convinces
as
can
no
other
method
and
the
is
ready
with
such
citation
on
a
very
large
scale
indeed
at
the
first
moment
when
a
general
publicity
now
denied
shall
be
granted
to
it
moreover
this
reliance
of
the
jew
upon
the
futility
of
the
propaganda
omits
one
very
important
feature
the
group
is
built
up
of
men
differing
greatly
in
experience
in
judgment
and
policy
and
it
is
built
up
of
strata
differing
greatly
in
the
intensity
of
their
hatred
it
includes
many
a
man
with
administrative
experience
many
a
man
of
great
business
capacity
of
acquired
fortune
of
talent
in
affairs
it
includes
men
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
european
diplomacy
it
includes
men
in
great
numbers
with
the
literary
gift
of
expression
for
persuading
their
fellows
not
only
is
this
true
but
as
i
have
said
it
includes
a
large
right
wing
which
because
they
are
more
restrained
in
expression
than
the
rest
will
exercise
a
greater
weight
men
who
are
not
at
all
blinded
by
their
hatred
though
hatred
has
become
their
chief
motive
men
who
retain
full
capacity
for
organizing
a
plan
of
action
and
for
carrying
it
out
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
definite
line
which
divides
the
from
the
rest
of
those
who
are
attempting
to
solve
the
jewish
problem
it
is
the
line
dividing
those
whose
motive
is
peace
from
those
whose
motive
is
antagonism
it
is
the
line
dividing
those
whose
object
is
action
against
the
jew
and
those
whose
object
is
a
settlement
but
on
the
side
of
that
line
that
is
among
those
whose
determination
is
to
suppress
and
eliminate
jewish
influence
to
the
extreme
of
their
power
there
are
now
very
many
more
than
the
original
enthusiasts
who
created
the
movement
the
jews
should
further
remember
that
every
one
outside
their
own
community
is
potentially
an
not
every
one
perhaps
not
even
yet
a
majority
at
least
in
the
directing
and
wealthier
classes
is
other
than
friendly
or
indifferent
to
the
jews
but
there
has
grown
up
in
every
one
not
a
jew
something
of
reaction
against
the
jewish
power
it
requires
but
an
accident
to
change
this
from
the
latent
and
slight
thing
it
is
in
most
men
to
an
angry
passion
i
have
noticed
that
among
the
most
violent
of
are
those
who
had
passed
some
considerable
portion
of
their
early
manhood
in
ignorance
of
the
whole
problem
these
come
across
a
jew
unexpectedly
in
some
relation
hostile
to
them
they
lose
money
through
some
jewish
financial
operation
or
they
connect
for
the
first
time
in
middle
age
several
misfortunes
of
theirs
with
a
common
element
of
jewish
action
or
they
find
jews
mixed
up
in
some
attack
on
their
country
thenceforward
they
become
and
remain
unrepentant
the
dupe
when
he
discovers
he
has
been
duped
is
dangerous
and
there
is
even
a
considerable
category
of
those
who
have
suffered
nothing
even
by
accident
at
the
hand
of
the
jew
yet
who
when
they
discover
what
the
jewish
power
is
feel
they
have
been
played
with
and
grow
angry
at
the
trickery
it
has
been
and
will
be
with
as
with
all
movements
when
they
begin
they
are
ridiculed
as
they
grow
they
come
to
be
feared
and
boycotted
but
of
those
that
are
successful
it
may
be
justly
said
that
the
moment
of
success
begins
when
they
turn
the
corner
and
from
a
fad
become
a
fashion
it
is
still
doubtfully
the
fashion
to
separate
oneself
from
the
movement
you
still
hear
men
when
they
write
or
speak
upon
the
jewish
problem
no
matter
with
what
hostility
to
the
jew
excuse
themselves
as
a
rule
at
the
beginning
of
their
remarks
by
saying
i
am
no
for
some
flavour
of
the
old
ridicule
still
attaches
to
the
name
but
fashions
change
rapidly
and
the
new
fashion
which
comes
in
to
support
a
growing
thing
when
it
does
arrive
arrives
in
a
flood
we
can
all
of
us
remember
the
time
when
the
talk
of
nationalization
the
old
state
socialist
talk
was
the
talk
of
a
few
faddists
who
were
everywhere
ridiculed
and
despised
it
is
the
fashion
and
the
practice
of
state
control
state
support
the
universality
of
state
action
is
such
that
it
is
those
who
oppose
it
who
are
now
the
faddists
and
the
cranks
we
can
all
of
us
remember
the
day
when
in
the
united
states
a
prohibitionist
was
a
faddist
and
a
very
unpopular
faddist
at
that
we
have
seen
fashion
catch
him
up
with
a
vengeance
we
can
all
of
us
remember
the
day
when
the
supporters
of
suffrage
in
england
were
a
very
small
group
of
faddists
indeed
we
know
what
has
happened
there
the
forces
driving
men
towards
the
camp
are
far
stronger
than
the
forces
acting
upon
these
old
hobbies
of
women
suffrage
of
prohibition
and
the
rest
they
are
personal
intimate
forces
arising
from
the
strongest
racial
instincts
and
the
most
bitter
individual
memories
of
financial
loss
subjection
national
dishonour
for
instance
any
german
to
whom
you
may
talk
of
his
great
disaster
will
answer
by
telling
you
that
it
is
due
to
the
jews
that
the
jews
are
preying
upon
the
fallen
body
of
the
state
that
the
jews
are
rats
in
the
reich
for
one
man
that
blames
the
old
military
authorities
for
the
misfortunes
following
the
war
twenty
blame
the
jews
though
these
were
the
architects
of
the
former
german
prosperity
and
among
them
were
found
a
larger
proportion
of
opponents
of
the
war
than
in
any
other
section
of
the
emperor
subjects
that
is
but
one
example
you
will
find
it
repeated
in
one
form
or
another
in
almost
every
other
polity
of
the
modern
world
the
has
become
a
strong
political
figure
it
is
a
great
and
dangerous
error
at
this
moment
to
think
his
policy
is
futile
it
is
a
policy
of
action
and
a
policy
which
may
proceed
from
plan
to
execution
before
we
know
it
there
used
to
be
quoted
years
ago
and
i
have
myself
quoted
it
with
approval
a
famous
question
put
by
a
close
and
reasonable
observer
of
public
affairs
upon
the
continent
to
the
most
prominent
of
continental
in
that
day
the
question
was
this
if
you
had
unlimited
power
in
this
matter
what
would
you
do
the
implied
answer
was
that
the
could
do
nothing
he
could
not
make
a
law
which
would
segregate
the
jews
for
they
could
escape
that
law
by
mixing
with
those
around
them
he
could
not
make
a
law
exiling
them
for
first
it
would
be
impossible
to
define
them
secondly
even
if
that
were
possible
those
defined
would
not
be
received
elsewhere
what
could
he
do
the
implication
was
i
say
that
he
could
do
nothing
he
was
supposed
in
the
presence
of
that
question
to
admit
his
futility
unfortunately
we
now
know
that
he
do
something
the
can
persecute
he
can
attack
with
a
sufficient
force
behind
him
he
can
destroy
in
much
of
this
destruction
he
would
have
in
a
present
state
of
feeling
and
in
most
countries
the
mass
of
public
opinion
behind
him
he
could
begin
with
a
widespread
examination
of
jewish
wealth
and
its
origins
and
an
equally
widespread
confiscation
he
could
use
the
dread
of
such
confiscation
as
a
weapon
for
compelling
the
divulgence
of
jewish
origins
where
a
man
desired
to
conceal
them
he
could
do
this
not
only
in
the
case
of
the
wealthy
men
but
through
the
terror
of
wealthy
men
over
the
whole
field
of
the
jewish
community
he
could
introduce
registration
and
with
it
a
segregation
of
the
jews
inspired
as
he
would
be
by
no
desire
for
a
settlement
agreeable
to
them
but
solely
for
a
settlement
agreeable
to
he
could
aim
at
that
harsh
settlement
and
even
though
he
might
not
reach
his
goal
it
is
not
pleasant
to
envisage
what
he
might
do
on
his
way
to
it
but
even
though
the
fail
to
acquire
full
power
there
remain
attached
to
his
great
increase
in
numbers
and
intensity
of
feeling
the
prime
questions
what
is
the
of
the
thing
why
has
it
arisen
why
is
it
spreading
what
are
the
forces
nourishing
it
these
are
the
main
questions
which
those
who
regret
the
presence
of
such
a
passion
in
the
body
politic
which
those
who
are
alarmed
about
it
which
those
who
like
the
jews
themselves
must
if
they
are
to
avoid
a
catastrophe
defend
themselves
against
it
would
do
well
to
answer
there
has
not
been
as
yet
sufficient
time
to
answer
those
questions
fully
or
to
appreciate
this
great
reaction
in
its
entirety
but
we
can
already
judge
it
in
part
the
movement
is
essentially
a
reaction
against
the
abnormal
growth
in
jewish
power
and
the
new
strength
of
is
largely
due
to
the
jews
themselves
when
this
angry
enthusiasm
in
its
modern
form
first
in
germany
then
spreading
to
france
next
appearing
and
now
rapidly
growing
in
england
it
was
novel
and
confined
to
small
cliques
the
truths
which
it
enunciated
were
then
as
unfamiliar
as
the
false
values
on
which
it
also
reposed
that
universal
policy
of
the
jews
against
which
it
is
part
of
my
thesis
to
argue
a
policy
natural
but
none
the
less
erroneous
the
policy
of
the
policy
of
at
once
took
advantage
of
what
was
absurd
in
the
novelty
of
the
jew
in
spite
of
his
experience
of
menace
and
active
hostility
in
spite
of
his
knowledge
of
what
this
sort
of
spirit
had
effected
in
the
past
did
not
come
out
into
the
open
he
did
not
act
against
the
new
attack
with
open
indignation
still
less
with
open
argument
as
he
should
have
done
he
took
advantage
of
its
absurdity
at
its
beginnings
in
the
eyes
of
the
general
public
he
used
all
his
endeavours
to
make
the
word
a
label
for
something
hopelessly
ridiculous
a
subject
for
mere
laughter
a
matter
which
no
reasonable
man
should
for
a
moment
consider
seriously
for
something
between
a
dozen
and
twenty
years
this
policy
was
successful
the
method
though
less
and
less
firmly
established
as
time
went
on
has
not
yet
quite
failed
none
the
less
that
policy
was
very
it
was
used
not
only
to
ridicule
the
but
what
was
quite
illegitimate
quite
irrational
and
bound
in
the
long
run
to
be
fatal
it
was
used
to
prevent
all
discussion
of
the
jewish
question
though
that
question
was
increasing
every
day
in
practical
importance
and
clamouring
to
be
decided
it
was
the
instinctive
policy
with
the
mass
of
the
jewish
nation
a
deliberate
policy
with
most
of
its
leaders
not
only
to
use
ridicule
against
but
to
label
as
any
discussion
of
the
jewish
problem
at
all
or
for
that
matter
any
information
even
on
the
jewish
problem
it
was
used
to
prevent
through
ridicule
any
statement
of
any
fact
with
regard
to
the
jewish
race
save
a
few
conventional
compliments
or
a
few
conventional
and
harmless
jests
if
a
man
alluded
to
the
presence
of
a
jewish
financial
power
in
any
region
for
instance
in
india
he
was
an
if
he
interested
himself
in
the
peculiar
character
of
jewish
philosophical
discussions
especially
in
matters
concerning
religion
he
was
an
if
the
emigrations
of
the
jewish
masses
from
country
to
country
the
vast
modern
invasion
of
the
united
states
for
instance
which
has
been
organized
and
controlled
like
an
army
on
the
march
interested
him
as
an
historian
he
could
not
speak
of
it
under
pain
of
being
called
an
if
he
exposed
a
financial
swindler
who
happened
to
be
a
jew
he
was
an
if
he
exposed
a
group
of
parliamentarians
taking
money
from
the
jews
he
was
an
if
he
did
no
more
than
call
a
jew
a
jew
he
was
an
the
laughter
which
the
name
used
to
provoke
was
most
foolishly
used
to
support
nothing
nobler
or
more
definitive
than
this
wretched
policy
of
concealment
anyone
with
judgment
could
have
told
the
jews
had
the
jews
cared
to
consult
such
an
one
that
their
pusillanimous
policy
was
bound
to
fail
it
was
but
a
postponement
of
the
evil
day
you
can
not
long
confuse
interest
with
hatred
the
statement
of
plain
and
important
truths
with
mania
the
discussion
of
fundamental
questions
with
silly
enthusiasm
for
the
same
reason
that
you
can
not
long
confuse
truth
with
falsehood
sooner
or
later
people
are
bound
to
remark
that
the
defendant
seems
curiously
anxious
to
avoid
all
investigation
of
his
case
the
moment
that
is
generally
observed
the
defence
is
on
the
way
to
failure
i
say
it
was
a
fatal
policy
but
it
was
deliberately
undertaken
by
the
jews
and
they
are
now
suffering
from
its
results
as
a
consequence
you
have
all
over
europe
a
mass
of
plain
men
who
so
far
from
being
scared
off
from
discussing
the
jewish
problem
by
this
false
ridicule
are
more
determined
than
ever
to
thrash
it
out
in
the
open
and
to
get
it
settled
upon
rational
and
final
lines
that
would
perhaps
be
no
great
harm
in
itself
it
would
merely
mean
that
a
false
policy
had
failed
and
that
proper
frank
and
loyal
discussion
would
succeed
all
this
hushing
up
and
boycott
unfortunately
the
false
policy
had
other
and
much
worse
consequences
it
exasperated
men
who
had
already
begun
to
interest
themselves
in
the
political
discussion
and
who
would
not
tolerate
undeserved
ridicule
it
heaped
up
a
world
of
determined
opposition
to
the
jews
it
is
not
exactly
that
the
has
already
won
or
even
is
as
yet
certainly
on
his
way
to
winning
but
he
now
has
his
chance
of
winning
whereas
some
few
years
ago
he
had
the
tide
against
him
he
is
now
through
the
fault
of
the
jews
themselves
at
its
turn
he
now
finds
himself
on
an
extreme
wing
it
is
true
but
to
a
very
large
body
which
is
already
strongly
biassed
against
the
jews
dislikes
their
presence
among
us
and
is
determined
to
act
against
them
not
only
where
they
still
have
great
power
but
also
where
that
power
is
visibly
declining
and
even
where
they
are
in
danger
it
must
not
be
forgotten
as
we
survey
this
growing
menace
that
a
policy
which
reaches
no
finality
is
not
on
that
account
futile
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
in
the
minds
of
many
men
one
might
say
in
the
minds
of
most
men
during
periods
of
excitement
a
policy
of
repression
though
always
failing
to
reach
finality
may
still
be
continuous
it
may
become
a
habit
and
may
endure
indefinitely
in
the
vast
suffering
of
its
victims
the
jews
have
seen
that
happen
in
many
a
small
nationality
other
than
their
own
they
have
seen
no
doubt
that
continued
repression
acting
in
an
atmosphere
of
equally
continuous
rebellion
has
usually
in
the
long
run
failed
but
they
must
admit
that
the
maintenance
of
such
repression
with
all
its
accompaniments
of
moral
and
physical
torture
confiscation
exile
and
all
the
rest
has
often
been
a
policy
long
drawn
out
it
has
been
drawn
out
in
some
cases
for
centuries
it
is
not
true
that
because
a
policy
does
not
aim
at
a
complete
settlement
therefore
it
can
not
be
undertaken
and
vigorously
pursued
it
can
time
and
again
a
hostile
force
has
attempted
to
eliminate
opposition
or
even
contrast
and
to
eliminate
it
by
every
instrument
including
massacre
itself
sometimes
very
rarely
it
has
succeeded
usually
it
has
in
the
long
run
failed
but
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
it
has
at
any
rate
continued
long
after
its
failure
was
apparent
that
is
the
danger
which
menaces
from
the
phenomenon
i
have
examined
in
this
chapter
it
would
be
madness
in
the
jews
to
neglect
that
phenomenon
it
is
now
so
strong
in
numbers
intensity
of
conviction
and
passion
that
it
menaces
their
whole
immediate
future
in
our
civilization
its
ultimate
causes
we
have
explored
its
immediate
cause
the
cause
of
its
sudden
development
and
present
startling
growth
we
have
seen
to
be
the
jewish
action
in
russia
and
to
this
which
i
have
already
touched
upon
in
my
third
chapter
where
i
sketched
the
sequence
of
events
leading
up
to
the
present
situation
i
will
next
turn
in
order
to
make
a
more
detailed
examination
of
it
for
undoubtedly
it
is
the
sudden
appearance
of
jewish
that
has
brought
things
to
their
present
crisis
bolshevism
chapter
viii
bolshevism
the
bolshevist
explosion
which
will
appear
in
history
i
think
as
the
point
of
departure
from
which
shall
date
the
new
attitude
of
the
western
nations
towards
the
jews
is
not
only
a
field
in
which
we
can
study
the
evil
effect
of
secrecy
but
one
in
which
we
can
analyse
all
the
various
forces
which
tend
to
bring
israel
into
such
ceaseless
conflict
with
the
society
around
it
it
merits
therefore
a
very
special
examination
both
as
an
opportunity
for
the
study
of
our
subject
and
as
a
of
the
first
moment
in
history
why
did
a
jewish
organization
thus
attempt
to
transform
society
why
did
it
use
the
methods
which
we
know
it
used
why
was
that
particular
venue
chosen
what
aim
had
the
actors
in
view
what
measure
of
success
did
they
hope
to
achieve
by
what
method
do
they
propose
to
extend
their
influence
when
we
can
answer
those
questions
we
shall
have
gone
far
to
discovering
the
almost
fatal
causes
of
conflict
between
this
peculiar
nation
and
those
among
whom
they
move
the
answers
usually
given
to
these
questions
by
the
avowed
enemies
of
the
jewish
race
are
always
inadequate
and
often
false
when
they
contain
an
element
of
truth
which
they
often
do
that
truth
is
quite
insufficient
to
account
for
the
full
phenomena
but
the
accretions
of
falsehood
and
exaggeration
render
the
whole
thing
inexplicable
indeed
these
explanations
of
the
russian
revolution
are
very
good
specimens
of
the
way
in
which
the
european
so
misunderstands
the
jew
that
he
imputes
to
him
powers
which
neither
he
nor
any
other
poor
mortal
can
ever
exercise
thus
we
are
asked
to
believe
that
this
political
upheaval
was
part
of
one
plot
centuries
old
the
agents
of
which
were
millions
of
human
beings
all
pledged
to
the
destruction
of
our
society
and
acting
in
complete
discipline
under
a
few
leaders
superhumanly
wise
the
thing
is
nonsense
on
the
face
of
it
men
have
no
capacity
for
acting
in
this
fashion
they
are
far
too
limited
far
too
diverse
moreover
the
motive
is
completely
lacking
why
merely
destroy
and
why
if
your
object
is
merely
to
destroy
manifest
such
wide
differences
in
your
aims
one
may
say
justly
that
there
is
always
a
tendency
to
reaction
against
alien
surroundings
and
in
so
far
as
that
reaction
is
intense
and
effective
it
is
destructive
of
those
surroundings
one
may
point
out
that
such
reaction
in
the
case
of
the
jews
as
in
the
case
of
all
other
alien
bodies
is
in
the
main
unconscious
and
instinctive
all
that
is
true
enough
but
the
conception
of
a
vast
plot
culminating
in
the
contemporary
russian
affair
will
not
hold
water
any
more
than
will
the
corresponding
hallucination
which
led
men
to
believe
that
the
french
revolution
a
thing
utterly
different
in
kind
from
the
russian
was
the
mere
outward
expression
of
a
strictly
disciplined
secret
body
in
the
case
of
the
french
revolution
everything
was
put
down
by
the
forerunners
of
enthusiasts
to
the
secret
agency
of
the
order
of
templars
acting
unweariedly
through
six
centuries
and
finally
bringing
down
the
french
monarchy
in
the
case
of
course
of
the
bolshevist
anarchy
a
still
longer
range
is
given
to
the
final
result
for
templars
read
jews
and
for
read
years
it
is
all
smoke
more
serious
is
the
statement
that
this
combination
of
jews
for
the
destruction
of
the
old
russian
society
was
an
act
of
racial
revenge
there
is
a
great
element
of
truth
in
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
greater
part
of
the
jews
who
took
over
power
in
the
russian
cities
four
years
ago
felt
an
appetite
for
revenge
against
the
old
russian
state
comparable
to
that
felt
by
any
oppressed
people
against
their
oppressors
probably
it
was
more
intense
even
than
any
other
example
that
could
be
quoted
we
are
all
witnesses
to
the
way
in
which
the
russian
people
religion
and
government
and
particularly
the
person
and
office
of
the
emperor
were
attacked
and
decried
by
the
jews
in
western
europe
of
the
way
in
which
the
jews
ceaselessly
conspired
against
the
russian
state
and
of
the
brutal
repression
to
which
they
were
subject
when
you
release
a
force
of
hatred
so
violent
it
may
run
to
any
length
that
sudden
release
that
sudden
opportunity
for
satisfying
the
thirst
for
vengeance
must
explain
a
very
large
part
of
what
followed
but
even
that
does
not
account
for
the
whole
it
would
account
for
mere
massacre
and
mere
chaos
it
would
not
account
for
the
attempts
rather
pitiful
attempts
at
construction
and
for
the
obviously
designed
system
of
direction
which
has
continued
on
the
same
lines
since
the
jews
first
assumed
power
and
is
still
fully
manifest
after
nearly
five
years
of
that
power
still
less
is
it
sufficient
to
say
that
the
jew
is
everywhere
the
organizer
and
leader
of
revolution
and
that
we
only
see
him
at
work
in
russia
with
greater
vigour
and
thoroughness
because
the
opportunity
is
there
greater
the
jew
is
not
everywhere
a
revolutionary
he
is
everywhere
discontented
with
a
society
alien
to
him
that
is
natural
and
inevitable
but
he
does
not
exercise
his
power
invariably
or
even
ordinarily
towards
the
oversetting
of
an
established
social
order
by
which
incidentally
he
often
largely
benefits
you
do
not
find
the
jew
in
history
perpetually
leading
the
innumerable
revolts
which
citizens
in
the
mass
make
against
the
privileged
or
the
superior
conditions
of
the
minority
he
has
sometimes
benefited
by
these
movements
in
the
past
more
often
suffered
we
often
find
individual
jews
sympathizing
with
the
revolutionary
side
but
we
also
find
many
individual
jews
sympathizing
with
the
other
the
jew
is
not
in
the
history
of
europe
the
prime
agent
of
revolution
quite
the
contrary
the
great
acts
of
violence
successful
and
unsuccessful
which
have
marked
our
society
from
the
agrarian
troubles
of
pagan
rome
to
the
french
revolution
the
land
war
in
ireland
the
chartist
movement
in
london
or
whatever
modern
movement
you
will
have
appealed
much
more
to
the
fighting
instincts
and
political
traditions
of
race
than
they
have
to
the
jews
they
are
marked
everywhere
by
an
attitude
towards
property
and
patriotism
which
are
the
very
opposite
of
the
characteristics
the
revolutions
of
the
past
were
for
the
better
distribution
of
property
and
for
the
betterment
of
the
state
often
they
were
openly
undertaken
because
patriotism
had
been
offended
by
defeat
in
war
and
because
the
nation
was
thought
to
be
betrayed
usually
they
were
jingo
and
always
for
distribution
of
wealth
it
is
the
unique
mark
of
the
russian
revolution
and
of
its
attempted
extension
elsewhere
that
it
repudiates
patriotism
and
the
division
of
property
in
that
it
differs
from
all
others
and
it
is
markedly
obviously
but
why
had
the
jews
a
chance
of
action
in
russia
which
they
lacked
elsewhere
what
were
the
special
characters
in
the
russian
opportunity
which
made
the
jew
the
creator
of
the
whole
movement
there
are
i
take
it
three
main
factors
present
in
this
case
peculiarly
suitable
to
the
jewish
effort
in
the
first
place
this
revolution
fell
upon
and
was
directed
towards
a
particular
social
phenomenon
in
which
that
profound
instinct
in
the
european
the
desire
for
settled
property
had
decayed
it
fell
upon
the
state
of
affairs
called
the
chief
mark
of
which
is
the
destruction
in
the
mass
subjected
to
it
or
at
any
rate
the
atrophying
of
that
essential
part
of
the
european
soul
ownership
the
jew
is
undoubtedly
unable
to
sympathize
with
us
in
that
central
core
of
our
civic
instincts
he
has
never
understood
the
european
sense
of
property
and
i
doubt
if
he
ever
will
but
in
russia
was
quite
new
the
resentment
against
it
was
keen
the
victims
were
the
sons
of
peasants
or
had
themselves
been
born
peasants
so
that
this
proletarian
mass
in
the
russian
towns
though
less
than
a
tenth
of
the
whole
nation
was
peculiarly
open
to
propaganda
against
its
masters
and
an
attack
successfully
conducted
on
that
weakest
point
of
modern
capitalism
might
easily
succeed
and
spread
to
neighbouring
industrialized
centres
in
poland
germany
and
so
westward
now
the
attack
on
this
international
phenomenon
an
attack
directed
against
industrial
capitalism
required
an
international
force
it
needed
men
who
had
international
experience
and
were
ready
with
an
international
formula
there
are
two
and
only
two
organized
international
forces
in
europe
with
a
soul
and
identity
in
them
one
is
the
catholic
church
and
the
other
is
jewry
but
the
catholic
church
for
reasons
which
i
will
discuss
in
a
moment
can
not
and
never
will
directly
attack
industrial
capitalism
it
will
undoubtedly
attack
that
system
in
flank
and
indirectly
destroy
it
in
the
long
run
wherever
the
faith
has
a
strong
hold
upon
masses
of
people
but
it
will
not
and
can
not
directly
attack
it
the
jew
on
the
other
hand
is
free
to
attack
it
precisely
because
our
sense
of
property
means
nothing
to
him
is
to
him
something
strange
and
even
i
think
comic
further
the
jew
was
present
he
was
on
the
spot
the
church
was
not
of
the
two
international
forces
present
therefore
the
jews
alone
could
act
here
i
must
digress
and
say
why
the
other
great
international
force
the
catholic
church
has
not
been
able
and
will
never
be
able
to
attack
industrial
capitalism
as
a
whole
and
directly
though
as
i
have
said
it
acts
indirectly
as
a
solvent
of
this
evil
and
will
destroy
it
wherever
society
remains
catholic
the
catholic
church
not
only
in
its
abstract
doctrine
but
acting
as
the
expression
of
our
european
civilization
is
profoundly
attached
to
the
conception
of
private
property
it
makes
the
family
the
unit
of
the
state
and
it
perceives
that
the
freedom
of
the
family
is
most
secure
where
the
family
owns
it
perceives
as
do
all
europeans
instinctively
or
explicitly
that
property
is
the
correlative
of
freedom
or
at
any
rate
of
that
only
kind
of
freedom
which
we
europeans
care
to
have
that
it
is
the
safeguard
of
spiritual
health
the
mark
of
which
is
humour
of
breadth
and
diversity
in
action
of
elasticity
in
the
state
of
permanence
in
institutions
property
as
widely
distributed
as
possible
but
sacred
as
a
principle
is
an
inevitable
social
accompaniment
of
catholicism
apart
from
this
it
is
also
a
definite
feature
of
catholic
doctrine
to
deny
that
private
property
is
immoral
no
catholic
can
say
that
private
property
is
immoral
without
cutting
himself
off
from
the
communion
of
the
church
any
more
than
he
can
say
that
the
authority
in
the
state
is
immoral
he
can
not
be
a
communist
in
abstract
morals
any
more
than
he
can
be
an
anarchist
now
industrial
capitalism
is
a
disease
of
property
it
is
the
monstrous
state
of
affairs
in
which
a
very
few
men
derive
their
vast
advantage
from
the
corresponding
fact
that
most
men
whom
they
exploit
do
not
own
but
it
remains
true
that
the
of
capitalism
is
a
sense
of
ownership
in
the
mass
as
well
as
in
the
privileged
few
the
only
moral
force
remaining
to
industrial
capitalism
the
only
spiritual
tie
which
prevents
its
dissolution
is
this
admission
by
the
european
mind
that
property
is
a
right
even
property
in
a
diseased
and
exaggerated
form
the
whole
of
the
operations
of
industrial
capitalism
rely
upon
the
sanctity
of
property
and
the
sanctity
of
contract
which
develops
from
the
sanctity
of
property
and
whenever
society
loses
this
sense
industrial
capitalism
will
fall
into
chaos
the
church
can
not
deny
that
one
moral
principle
its
action
will
always
be
towards
the
dissolution
of
the
great
accumulations
promoted
by
capitalism
it
always
will
work
indirectly
for
the
establishment
of
property
an
ideal
defined
by
the
voice
of
its
great
modern
pope
leo
xiii
who
explicitly
states
it
in
his
but
the
church
can
never
take
the
short
cut
of
destroying
industrial
capitalism
root
and
branch
and
at
once
by
erecting
against
it
the
doctrine
of
communism
or
as
many
people
call
diluted
communism
socialism
it
never
can
do
so
in
theory
and
still
less
will
it
ever
do
so
in
practice
a
catholic
society
will
always
tend
to
be
a
society
of
owners
with
all
the
elements
of
with
the
guild
with
masses
of
corporate
property
attached
to
the
state
or
connected
with
the
city
with
the
college
with
the
corporation
for
without
such
corporate
property
in
a
state
property
is
never
well
founded
the
jew
has
neither
that
political
instinct
in
his
national
tradition
nor
a
religious
doctrine
supporting
and
expressing
such
an
instinct
the
same
thing
in
him
which
makes
him
a
speculator
and
a
nomad
blinds
him
to
and
makes
him
actually
contemptuous
of
the
european
sense
of
property
when
therefore
we
have
reached
through
industrial
capitalism
or
any
other
social
disease
a
state
of
affairs
in
which
the
practical
denial
of
property
is
possible
because
the
mass
of
men
have
lost
the
desire
for
it
and
when
the
repudiation
of
property
offers
an
immediate
solution
for
intolerable
evils
then
the
jew
can
appear
at
once
as
a
leader
one
must
find
in
such
a
movement
an
international
leader
because
the
disease
is
international
and
still
more
because
the
proposed
cure
of
that
disease
through
communism
be
international
if
it
is
to
succeed
a
communist
society
may
stand
apart
from
the
general
society
of
owners
in
other
countries
but
if
it
is
to
succeed
in
competition
with
them
it
must
convert
them
to
its
own
creed
the
jew
took
international
action
for
granted
he
took
the
narrow
and
false
economic
view
of
property
that
it
was
a
mere
institution
to
be
modified
indefinitely
and
if
necessary
abolished
he
had
an
obvious
opportunity
for
leadership
accorded
to
him
when
international
action
against
property
was
demanded
again
our
national
sense
patriotism
which
is
incomprehensible
to
the
jew
save
on
the
false
analogy
of
his
own
peculiar
nomadic
and
tribal
patriotism
is
a
check
upon
communism
and
indeed
against
revolution
of
any
kind
the
process
of
thought
in
the
patriotic
citizen
largely
unconscious
but
none
the
less
efficacious
is
somewhat
as
follows
i
can
not
function
save
as
a
citizen
of
my
nation
and
what
is
more
that
nation
made
me
what
i
am
it
is
my
creator
in
a
sense
and
so
has
authority
over
me
i
must
even
give
up
my
life
in
its
defence
if
necessary
because
but
for
its
existence
i
and
those
like
me
could
not
be
my
happiness
my
freedom
of
individual
action
my
are
all
bound
up
with
the
existence
of
the
civic
unit
of
which
i
am
a
part
if
something
which
appears
to
me
good
in
the
abstract
or
which
apparently
will
procure
for
me
a
material
good
involves
danger
to
that
civic
unit
i
must
forego
the
good
regarding
the
continued
existence
and
strength
of
my
people
as
a
greater
good
to
which
the
lesser
should
be
sacrificed
that
i
say
roughly
is
the
expression
of
the
patriotic
instinct
in
the
european
man
that
is
what
he
has
felt
for
many
and
many
a
great
state
in
the
past
and
for
every
polity
to
which
he
has
ever
belonged
that
is
what
he
feels
for
his
country
the
jew
has
the
same
feeling
of
course
for
his
israel
but
since
that
nation
is
not
a
collection
of
human
beings
inhabiting
one
place
and
living
by
traditions
rooted
in
its
soil
since
it
has
not
a
strong
visible
external
form
his
patriotism
is
necessarily
of
a
different
complexion
it
has
different
connotations
and
our
patriotism
seems
negligible
to
him
the
implied
fallacies
current
in
the
modern
industrial
revolutionary
formulæ
in
such
phrases
as
what
does
it
matter
to
the
working
man
whether
he
is
exploited
by
a
german
or
an
english
master
or
again
why
should
the
individual
tom
smith
be
sacrificed
for
an
abstraction
called
england
or
again
nationalism
is
the
great
obstacle
to
the
full
development
of
humanity
all
that
sort
of
thing
which
we
feel
by
instinct
and
can
if
it
is
necessary
prove
by
reason
to
be
nonsense
in
our
case
sounds
in
jewish
ears
as
very
good
sense
indeed
for
in
his
case
these
things
involve
no
fallacies
at
all
they
apply
to
vividly
and
exactly
why
should
the
jew
be
sacrificed
for
england
in
what
way
is
england
or
france
or
ireland
or
any
other
nation
necessary
to
again
is
it
not
obvious
in
his
eyes
that
these
terms
france
ireland
england
russia
are
but
abstractions
the
thing
in
his
eyes
when
he
thinks
of
us
is
the
individual
and
his
certain
needs
especially
his
physical
and
material
needs
because
upon
these
there
can
be
no
doubt
upon
these
all
are
agreed
these
are
visible
and
tangible
england
france
poland
are
whimsies
it
is
true
that
if
you
were
to
put
his
special
case
to
the
jew
with
similar
force
and
say
no
jew
should
run
any
risk
for
israel
no
jew
should
suffer
any
inconvenience
by
trying
to
help
a
fellow
jew
in
distress
the
idea
of
israel
is
a
vague
abstraction
all
that
counts
is
the
individual
jew
and
especially
his
physical
requirements
if
you
said
that
sort
of
thing
you
would
be
offending
the
most
profound
instincts
of
jewish
patriotism
and
you
would
in
fact
clash
with
the
overt
and
covert
action
of
the
jews
throughout
the
world
but
the
jew
would
answer
that
as
his
was
an
international
polity
the
argument
applying
to
our
national
polity
did
not
apply
to
him
that
his
feelings
though
analogous
to
ours
were
of
a
different
kind
and
that
at
any
rate
he
can
not
sacrifice
a
fine
idea
of
his
like
communism
for
our
provincial
and
local
habit
called
by
us
europeans
the
love
of
our
country
there
is
more
than
this
in
the
business
even
those
truths
which
we
know
to
be
truths
have
little
effect
upon
us
unless
they
enter
into
the
practice
of
our
lives
there
are
no
doubt
a
number
of
jews
who
would
admit
at
once
the
truth
of
any
nationalist
statement
made
by
a
european
when
a
frenchman
or
an
englishman
or
a
russian
says
to
him
my
first
duty
is
to
my
people
i
must
keep
them
strong
as
well
as
in
being
and
i
must
sacrifice
my
interests
to
theirs
when
it
is
necessary
there
are
many
jews
who
would
answer
you
are
quite
right
the
theory
is
sound
man
can
only
function
as
a
part
of
a
particular
society
and
so
forth
but
it
is
one
thing
to
recognize
a
truth
and
another
thing
to
experience
it
in
one
bones
as
it
were
and
these
truths
even
where
he
is
admitting
them
are
truths
indifferent
to
the
jew
therefore
when
as
in
the
particular
case
of
russia
a
national
feeling
stood
in
the
way
of
an
abstract
ideal
it
seemed
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
to
the
jew
that
the
national
obstacle
should
go
to
the
wall
in
order
that
ideal
of
communism
might
triumph
there
lay
behind
this
great
change
in
the
russian
towns
and
the
capture
of
what
remains
of
russian
government
by
the
jewish
committees
a
force
most
positive
it
was
the
sense
of
social
justice
the
indignation
against
indefensible
evils
that
sense
of
social
justice
that
indignation
against
indefensible
modern
evils
we
all
feel
there
may
be
men
among
the
wealthier
classes
of
western
europe
who
are
so
ignorant
of
the
past
or
so
stupid
that
they
do
honestly
believe
industrial
capitalism
to
be
an
inevitable
and
even
perhaps
a
good
thing
but
such
men
must
be
very
rare
not
only
must
they
be
rare
but
they
can
not
have
any
wide
social
experience
a
man
has
only
got
to
live
the
life
of
the
poor
in
the
great
industrial
cities
for
a
day
to
see
the
enormity
of
the
wrong
that
has
to
be
righted
there
are
of
course
not
a
few
but
many
thousands
of
individuals
who
try
to
find
arguments
for
industrial
capitalism
either
because
they
benefit
themselves
through
the
system
and
are
the
richer
by
it
or
because
they
are
the
hired
servants
of
those
who
so
benefit
and
of
this
kind
are
the
writers
in
the
capitalist
press
but
all
these
who
are
hired
advocates
or
advocates
with
a
direct
proprietary
interest
in
the
continuance
of
the
modern
disease
may
be
neglected
for
they
are
not
in
good
faith
they
are
not
really
arguing
that
the
thing
is
good
in
itself
they
are
only
trying
to
find
arguments
as
lawyers
do
for
something
which
they
have
to
defend
and
which
in
their
hearts
they
admit
is
evil
or
to
the
evil
of
which
they
are
indifferent
so
long
as
it
gives
them
a
disproportionate
share
of
material
enjoyment
we
must
add
to
these
the
sincere
man
who
will
admit
the
domination
of
industrial
capitalism
because
he
honestly
believes
that
bad
as
it
is
it
is
become
inevitable
and
that
to
tamper
with
it
would
bring
the
whole
state
into
anarchy
such
as
it
is
he
would
say
the
structure
of
our
society
now
depends
upon
it
we
may
palliate
its
evils
we
may
try
very
gradually
to
transform
its
worst
features
but
in
its
essence
it
must
remain
as
it
is
or
our
last
state
will
be
worse
than
our
first
of
this
kind
are
those
who
argue
that
any
social
experiment
antagonistic
to
industrial
capitalism
if
pushed
sufficiently
far
would
result
in
famine
and
chaos
and
even
physical
evils
far
worse
than
the
physical
evils
which
the
mass
of
men
have
to
suffer
in
the
great
towns
which
capitalism
has
produced
apart
from
these
categories
the
masses
of
men
i
say
are
convinced
that
industrial
capitalism
is
an
evil
an
evil
of
the
grossest
sort
an
evil
of
a
sort
unknown
to
the
greater
part
of
human
history
and
unknown
in
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
an
evil
which
those
peasant
societies
or
societies
of
property
throughout
europe
are
happy
to
have
escaped
and
an
evil
from
which
we
who
are
caught
in
it
are
trying
to
escape
as
best
we
may
in
that
modifying
phrase
as
best
we
may
lies
the
crux
for
the
great
mass
of
europeans
feel
that
any
attack
on
industrial
capitalism
which
denies
the
nation
its
supreme
place
or
which
impedes
the
superior
task
of
keeping
the
nation
strong
and
wealthy
is
barred
they
also
feel
instinctively
that
any
attack
which
denies
the
general
right
of
private
property
and
the
value
of
that
institution
to
the
healthy
conduct
of
our
affairs
is
also
barred
the
great
mass
of
our
race
when
faced
by
the
problem
of
industrial
capitalism
feel
that
it
has
to
be
solved
in
some
way
that
will
neither
destroy
property
nor
the
nation
through
which
the
individual
alone
can
function
but
this
which
is
true
of
the
great
mass
of
our
race
is
not
true
of
the
jews
therefore
they
were
able
in
the
case
of
the
russian
revolution
to
go
straight
for
their
object
and
that
object
was
apart
from
the
obvious
object
of
revenge
of
love
of
power
and
the
rest
the
destruction
of
an
economic
inequality
these
jews
who
have
destroyed
what
we
knew
as
russia
were
undoubtedly
possessed
of
a
political
ideal
the
ideal
of
communism
no
doubt
many
individuals
among
them
all
ultimately
would
prefer
the
good
of
israel
to
the
good
of
any
russian
no
doubt
the
wreaking
of
vengeance
upon
former
oppressors
was
strong
as
also
the
appetite
for
destroying
a
general
and
a
national
sentiment
alien
to
them
and
even
repulsive
to
them
but
there
remains
as
a
positive
motive
behind
the
whole
affair
the
ideal
of
communism
the
jews
alone
of
the
forces
present
were
capable
of
heartily
entertaining
that
ideal
and
were
free
of
all
obstacles
against
the
achievement
of
it
the
obstacle
of
patriotism
the
obstacle
of
religion
the
obstacle
of
the
sense
of
property
these
considerations
i
take
it
are
what
explains
the
jewish
character
of
the
upheaval
in
the
east
with
its
destruction
of
the
russian
nation
its
enormous
experiments
in
social
economy
its
inevitable
impoverishment
of
the
state
as
a
whole
its
enthusiastic
support
by
the
minority
which
accepts
its
doctrine
those
very
few
men
and
women
who
have
been
witnesses
of
the
jewish
experiment
in
russia
excluding
those
engaged
in
propaganda
upon
one
side
or
the
other
give
us
a
picture
which
is
much
what
we
should
have
expected
of
the
situation
it
seems
that
the
great
mass
of
the
nation
has
affirmed
the
instinct
of
private
property
with
the
greatest
vigour
and
that
some
of
the
russians
have
settled
down
upon
the
land
to
which
they
always
claimed
ownership
and
in
which
their
sense
of
ownership
is
more
fierce
than
ever
in
the
towns
the
unnatural
system
unnatural
because
it
opposes
all
our
instincts
as
europeans
works
more
and
more
slackly
as
the
original
system
of
terror
weakens
for
it
is
clear
that
communism
needs
a
despot
and
the
active
rule
of
a
despot
is
necessarily
short
it
is
a
system
incapable
of
transition
and
therefore
of
duration
the
perfectly
explicable
but
deplorable
exercise
of
vengeance
by
the
jews
has
been
directed
against
what
we
euphemistically
term
the
governing
directing
classes
who
have
been
massacred
wholesale
and
whose
remnants
are
subjected
to
perpetual
persecution
the
productivity
of
the
industrial
masses
has
naturally
sunk
to
a
very
low
level
because
under
communism
it
can
only
work
through
something
like
military
discipline
and
work
done
under
those
conditions
is
on
a
much
lower
productive
level
than
free
work
but
the
real
interest
in
the
jewish
revolution
in
russia
to
which
is
now
permanently
affixed
the
name
of
bolshevist
which
is
nothing
more
than
the
russian
for
lies
in
these
two
points
first
the
continued
propaganda
of
communism
throughout
the
world
which
propaganda
in
organization
and
direction
is
in
the
hands
of
jewish
agents
secondly
and
much
more
important
the
effect
of
the
jewish
revolution
in
producing
hostility
to
the
jews
throughout
the
world
i
say
this
second
fact
is
much
more
important
because
it
is
the
more
real
and
the
more
enduring
you
will
never
make
a
communist
of
the
tenacious
intelligent
and
humorous
occidental
european
you
will
no
more
make
a
communist
of
him
than
you
will
make
him
walk
on
all
fours
or
permanently
abjure
the
use
of
good
liquor
you
may
get
faddists
to
accept
communism
as
a
mere
creed
and
of
course
you
can
easily
get
exasperated
men
ground
down
by
capitalism
to
accept
theory
system
which
promises
them
relief
but
you
will
not
get
communism
working
in
men
who
boast
the
old
european
blood
in
the
descendants
of
those
who
created
our
past
and
its
monuments
they
will
certainly
preserve
their
traditions
and
their
character
though
the
peril
must
be
combated
and
is
being
successfully
combated
everywhere
it
is
not
a
peril
of
great
magnitude
to
the
west
the
other
effect
of
the
jewish
revolution
in
russia
the
peril
into
which
it
has
put
the
jews
themselves
permanent
and
of
the
first
magnitude
i
know
no
way
to
meet
it
except
to
explain
why
that
revolution
was
almost
necessarily
a
jewish
revolution
to
emphasize
the
sincerity
of
the
jews
who
have
led
it
to
exculpate
them
as
far
as
possible
and
at
any
rate
to
shield
their
unfortunate
compatriots
abroad
from
the
consequences
of
what
was
certainly
a
very
bad
piece
of
tactics
so
far
as
the
future
of
this
people
was
concerned
we
ought
i
think
not
to
nourish
a
new
and
special
hostility
against
the
jew
on
account
of
what
he
has
done
in
russia
but
on
the
contrary
to
excuse
him
especially
because
he
is
a
jew
we
ought
as
it
seems
to
me
to
say
he
had
reasons
for
action
and
excuse
for
action
which
men
of
our
race
would
not
have
had
and
though
we
must
prevent
that
action
from
spreading
we
must
not
allow
what
seemed
quite
natural
under
the
circumstances
to
the
jew
to
warp
our
attempted
solution
of
the
jewish
problem
we
ought
to
work
for
its
solution
as
impartially
and
as
soberly
as
though
the
provocation
of
bolshevism
had
never
been
given
that
sounds
an
extreme
thing
to
say
and
i
fear
it
will
be
ridiculed
by
most
of
those
who
as
they
tell
us
have
had
their
eyes
opened
by
the
bolshevist
explosion
and
who
are
now
confirmed
enemies
of
the
jewish
people
but
though
it
sound
fantastic
i
am
convinced
that
it
is
a
right
attitude
to
lose
one
judgment
on
a
permanent
problem
through
panic
or
heat
to
forget
the
elements
of
such
a
problem
merely
because
it
has
been
presented
to
us
suddenly
in
an
acute
form
is
the
negation
of
reason
as
well
might
a
man
who
is
dealing
with
the
problem
of
fermented
liquor
and
trying
to
get
people
to
use
it
rationally
let
his
judgment
be
overcome
by
a
case
of
delirium
tremens
and
rush
thereupon
into
some
scheme
of
prohibition
the
very
test
which
distinguishes
good
statesmanship
from
bad
is
the
power
to
keep
one
head
under
provocations
like
these
to
maintain
a
middle
course
and
to
aim
at
whatever
solution
our
reason
tells
us
to
be
just
under
circumstances
we
who
saw
the
gravity
of
the
jewish
problem
long
before
the
recognition
of
it
was
general
and
who
studied
it
under
calmer
conditions
for
many
years
have
a
right
to
be
heard
now
now
that
the
tide
is
making
against
these
people
and
that
the
fear
of
anarchy
threatens
to
turn
men
heads
we
were
long
blamed
for
attacking
the
jews
we
are
already
blamed
for
defending
them
it
is
a
proof
that
our
attitude
is
well
grounded
and
unaffected
by
fashion
the
bolshevist
revolution
will
not
last
its
jewish
character
was
inevitable
it
had
a
side
to
it
of
jewish
enthusiasm
for
a
sort
of
incorporeal
justice
and
in
any
case
it
ought
not
to
be
allowed
to
deflect
us
from
a
conclusion
which
the
much
larger
lines
of
history
and
all
general
considerations
of
reason
impose
our
conclusion
as
i
have
said
is
a
recognition
and
protection
of
the
jewish
nation
as
something
quite
different
from
ourselves
and
yet
necessarily
inhabiting
our
society
such
a
full
recognition
leaves
us
against
the
tendency
in
the
jew
which
we
can
not
avoid
to
forget
our
national
feelings
and
to
misconceive
our
sense
of
ownership
it
would
render
impossible
the
conspiracies
and
the
vengeance
which
have
destroyed
russia
and
i
believe
that
had
the
former
russian
government
treated
the
jews
as
i
say
they
should
be
treated
it
would
be
in
power
the
position
in
the
world
as
a
whole
chapter
ix
the
position
in
the
world
as
a
whole
the
danger
of
the
jewish
nation
in
the
world
may
be
summed
up
in
this
phrase
the
jews
are
obtaining
control
and
we
will
not
be
controlled
by
them
that
is
the
simplest
formula
and
the
one
which
would
be
immediately
subscribed
to
by
the
whole
mass
of
those
outside
the
jewish
community
who
are
alive
to
the
question
at
all
being
the
simplest
form
of
the
truth
it
needs
when
applied
to
a
highly
complex
situation
detailed
modification
this
modification
proceeds
from
three
sources
first
the
extent
of
the
jewish
control
and
the
extent
of
the
resentment
against
that
control
vary
very
largely
from
one
community
to
another
secondly
the
civic
tradition
of
each
community
in
its
treatment
of
the
jewish
question
also
differs
from
that
of
every
other
though
these
various
traditions
fall
into
certain
fairly
groups
thirdly
the
position
is
modified
according
to
the
presence
in
varying
degrees
of
strength
in
different
communities
of
certain
international
forces
even
more
powerful
than
the
jews
themselves
the
four
principal
of
the
international
forces
are
the
catholic
church
islam
the
forces
of
international
capitalism
and
the
international
reaction
against
it
of
the
industrial
proletariat
we
must
in
the
first
line
of
this
inquiry
make
an
important
premise
the
fact
from
which
we
proceed
namely
the
uneasy
feeling
that
the
jews
are
getting
control
and
the
determination
not
to
tolerate
that
control
will
be
denied
by
the
jews
themselves
it
is
denied
sincerely
i
have
entered
upon
too
many
discussions
with
them
and
heard
too
many
of
their
protestations
to
doubt
that
and
if
the
denial
were
valid
not
only
the
particular
survey
i
propose
in
this
chapter
but
the
whole
of
the
argument
of
this
book
would
fail
for
if
there
is
a
jewish
question
and
if
it
is
present
in
the
acute
form
in
which
we
all
know
it
to
be
present
it
is
not
due
merely
to
the
contrast
and
friction
between
the
jews
and
their
hosts
but
especially
to
this
feeling
of
domination
but
the
jewish
belief
in
this
matter
is
not
valid
sincerely
as
it
is
held
to
the
great
majority
of
jews
it
will
of
course
seem
what
has
the
unfortunate
poor
jew
in
the
slums
of
our
great
cities
to
do
with
controlling
the
modern
world
how
in
his
eyes
can
the
phrase
have
any
meaning
at
all
if
you
pass
from
him
to
the
comparatively
small
jewish
middle
class
you
would
hear
a
denial
almost
equally
vigorous
the
jewish
scientist
will
tell
you
that
he
is
concerned
with
his
researches
and
laughs
at
the
idea
of
interfering
with
his
neighbours
the
jewish
historian
that
he
is
concerned
with
his
documents
that
nothing
is
further
from
his
thoughts
than
interfering
with
people
outside
his
trade
the
little
jewish
shopkeeper
will
tell
you
that
he
is
in
active
competition
with
his
neighbours
and
by
no
means
always
successful
in
that
competition
the
jewish
lawyer
will
tell
you
that
he
is
concerned
with
the
system
of
law
in
which
he
happens
to
be
immersed
the
napoleonic
code
the
english
common
law
or
what
not
and
that
any
idea
of
his
personally
wanting
to
control
the
vast
majority
among
whom
he
lives
is
moonshine
and
so
it
is
the
great
jewish
banker
though
he
is
fully
aware
of
his
power
would
tell
you
that
in
his
daily
business
he
comes
up
against
forces
to
which
he
is
subject
and
has
competitors
who
are
at
the
best
neutral
and
more
commonly
hostile
to
israel
and
even
the
man
who
is
more
powerful
if
that
be
possible
than
the
jewish
banker
i
mean
the
jewish
monopolist
and
especially
the
jewish
monopolist
in
metal
though
he
would
be
extremely
annoyed
to
have
the
extent
of
his
control
exposed
will
feel
that
it
is
due
to
his
superior
abilities
and
in
no
way
designed
for
mastery
all
these
individual
replies
are
true
but
if
you
make
of
them
a
composite
and
general
reply
if
you
put
it
as
a
reply
of
all
israel
to
all
the
world
outside
crying
i
have
no
desire
for
supremacy
i
never
act
in
such
a
fashion
that
my
domination
can
be
felt
or
shall
increase
the
motive
is
not
present
even
subconsciously
among
my
people
then
that
general
reply
would
be
false
in
point
of
fact
the
jew
has
a
power
in
the
white
world
altogether
excessive
it
is
not
only
an
excessive
power
it
is
inevitably
a
power
and
therefore
a
power
it
is
not
only
excessive
and
in
the
main
organized
it
was
until
the
recent
reaction
began
a
rapidly
increasing
power
and
most
people
believe
it
to
be
still
increasing
to
that
the
whole
world
outside
the
jewish
community
will
testify
the
criterion
by
which
we
may
judge
whether
any
form
of
power
is
irritant
to
those
whom
it
affects
is
not
the
testimony
of
those
who
exercise
the
power
but
the
testimony
of
those
over
whom
it
is
exercised
there
never
was
a
tyranny
in
the
world
not
even
one
of
those
personal
tyrannies
which
have
been
so
much
more
highly
organized
and
so
much
more
direct
than
this
power
of
the
jews
there
never
has
been
a
despotism
in
history
which
would
not
tell
you
that
it
was
accidental
or
necessary
or
in
any
case
innocent
of
any
motive
of
oppression
and
history
universally
replies
to
judge
you
must
ask
those
who
felt
the
pressure
not
those
who
exercised
it
now
those
who
feel
the
pressure
in
the
matter
we
are
now
examining
are
unanimous
they
differ
in
the
degree
of
their
resentment
from
those
to
whom
the
thing
is
so
intolerable
that
they
are
already
in
active
revolt
against
it
to
those
who
feel
it
merely
as
a
distant
though
an
approaching
discomfort
but
everybody
feels
it
in
some
degree
it
is
a
universal
sensation
running
throughout
the
nerves
of
the
modern
world
and
it
is
growing
too
fast
in
degree
and
extent
to
be
ignored
i
have
already
quoted
the
effect
upon
those
hundreds
of
educated
men
taken
into
the
temporary
civil
service
during
the
late
war
when
they
found
holding
the
locked
gate
of
one
monopoly
after
another
the
international
jew
his
control
of
finance
needs
no
discussion
if
the
individual
banker
or
financier
is
not
aware
of
it
the
most
of
those
who
are
affected
are
acutely
aware
of
it
men
exaggerate
in
giving
it
a
sort
of
conscious
personality
but
they
certainly
do
not
exaggerate
when
they
point
to
its
effects
the
jew
must
remember
what
it
may
be
difficult
for
him
to
accept
and
what
is
certainly
true
that
not
only
is
his
domination
very
bitterly
resented
but
that
his
presence
in
any
position
of
control
whatsoever
is
odious
to
the
race
among
which
he
moves
everybody
feels
that
about
any
form
of
alien
control
much
more
do
they
feel
it
about
that
form
which
they
instinctively
know
to
be
most
alien
of
all
every
one
has
noticed
this
control
exercised
in
the
form
of
keeping
silence
upon
what
it
was
to
the
disadvantage
of
israel
to
have
known
in
the
form
of
the
advertising
of
what
it
was
to
the
advantage
of
israel
to
have
advertised
in
the
form
of
the
giving
and
withholding
of
credit
in
the
form
of
attack
in
the
press
against
nations
with
whom
israel
had
a
quarrel
and
the
defence
in
the
press
of
those
they
have
now
almost
disappeared
upon
whom
israel
in
the
immediate
past
relied
for
defence
and
everybody
has
discovered
what
is
not
unjust
indeed
what
is
inevitable
but
what
is
none
the
less
a
source
of
exasperation
the
solidarity
of
the
jewish
race
where
the
interests
of
any
member
of
it
were
concerned
but
if
the
thing
were
felt
everywhere
as
acutely
and
as
consciously
as
it
is
felt
in
special
groups
as
it
is
felt
for
instance
in
one
particular
section
of
english
opinion
already
represented
in
the
press
is
felt
in
a
wider
section
of
french
opinion
and
in
a
still
wider
section
of
polish
opinion
then
the
matter
would
be
simple
we
could
then
say
that
an
issue
of
the
clearest
kind
had
arisen
and
forbid
a
small
alien
minority
to
decide
the
destinies
of
those
among
whom
it
lives
and
of
whom
it
is
not
the
answer
would
be
obvious
and
the
only
difficulty
would
be
how
the
jewish
control
might
be
lessened
without
grievous
injustice
to
innocent
individuals
but
the
thing
is
not
so
felt
it
is
modified
as
i
have
said
by
the
varying
degrees
of
intensity
in
which
it
is
recognized
and
by
the
other
international
forces
which
come
into
play
if
we
consider
the
varying
political
traditions
and
the
varying
international
forces
if
we
examine
the
world
national
groups
we
shall
find
something
like
this
in
the
vast
body
of
russia
a
position
most
paradoxical
for
years
the
jew
was
everywhere
openly
attacked
and
hated
in
those
parts
of
the
russian
empire
where
he
was
allowed
to
live
in
large
numbers
these
were
nowhere
within
russia
proper
but
upon
the
western
outskirts
of
that
empire
within
what
was
once
the
old
polish
kingdom
and
largely
within
what
is
now
the
restored
republic
of
poland
but
the
russian
traditional
antagonism
to
the
jew
changed
in
a
few
weeks
of
chaos
to
something
not
opposite
but
novel
and
different
the
russian
allowed
a
prodigious
revolution
to
be
made
by
the
jews
he
accepted
the
loot
of
that
revolution
which
the
jew
secured
to
him
he
has
submitted
wholly
in
the
towns
partly
in
the
country
to
a
tyranny
exercised
by
jews
ever
since
that
complete
reversal
of
his
national
history
now
four
years
old
the
external
political
power
of
what
was
once
the
russian
empire
has
disappeared
the
jews
have
killed
it
but
the
great
mass
of
russian
humanity
remains
strongly
affected
by
this
curious
change
where
popular
instinct
works
untrammelled
the
old
and
violent
passionate
antagonism
between
the
russian
and
the
jew
survives
you
see
it
in
the
hotch
potch
of
the
ukraine
the
inhabitants
of
which
in
spite
of
all
theories
are
of
russian
race
and
tradition
and
the
central
town
of
which
is
the
sacred
region
of
russia
as
a
member
of
christendom
there
for
all
the
jewish
committees
with
large
towns
under
their
complete
control
there
have
been
repeated
revolts
but
in
the
greater
part
of
european
russia
at
least
and
in
much
of
what
was
once
the
asiatic
empire
the
jews
hold
what
is
left
of
the
executive
government
so
far
as
we
can
judge
from
the
very
imperfect
accounts
which
reach
us
for
nowhere
is
the
weapon
of
secrecy
more
ruthlessly
used
the
mass
of
the
russians
that
is
the
peasantry
are
in
two
minds
to
the
action
of
the
jewish
despotism
in
the
town
they
are
indifferent
but
to
his
early
attempts
against
themselves
they
were
bitterly
opposed
they
have
suffered
at
his
hands
and
they
thought
him
a
tyrant
but
the
jew
seems
to
have
dropped
this
interference
and
the
russian
soil
to
have
settled
down
as
a
peasant
proprietary
on
the
other
hand
it
was
a
revolution
guided
by
those
same
jewish
committees
which
secured
the
peasant
in
the
possession
of
his
land
the
russian
peasant
has
always
regarded
the
land
as
his
own
he
had
i
understand
regarded
that
odd
pedantic
measure
the
liberation
of
the
serfs
as
only
another
name
for
the
robbing
him
of
his
land
and
when
the
organization
of
russian
society
dissolved
in
the
strain
of
war
he
poured
over
the
great
estates
and
took
back
what
he
thought
was
his
own
for
the
strange
jewish
conception
of
communism
a
million
miles
removed
from
our
european
racial
instincts
and
our
high
civilized
traditions
the
russian
peasant
could
have
nothing
but
a
bewildered
contempt
none
the
less
he
was
conscious
that
the
jewish
revolution
had
permitted
him
if
not
to
take
the
land
he
did
that
himself
at
least
to
hold
it
and
the
revolution
is
indistinguishable
from
the
jewish
control
of
the
towns
within
the
towns
again
our
information
is
most
imperfect
and
i
can
only
piece
together
what
have
told
me
although
the
jew
is
of
course
individually
hated
yet
his
control
does
stand
for
certain
things
which
the
mass
of
the
people
still
support
he
organized
the
resentment
of
the
poor
against
the
rich
he
erected
before
their
eyes
the
pleasing
spectacle
of
a
social
revenge
he
carried
out
fairly
consistently
his
communist
programme
one
aspect
at
least
of
which
is
practical
enough
for
the
man
that
works
with
his
hands
finds
that
he
is
as
well
or
better
fed
out
of
the
meagre
common
stock
than
those
who
were
once
his
masters
in
general
i
think
it
true
to
say
that
the
jewish
control
over
christians
if
in
a
way
stronger
in
what
was
once
the
russian
empire
than
anywhere
else
is
also
there
least
resented
i
do
not
say
it
would
not
be
resented
if
it
were
to
excite
action
again
against
the
peasants
but
we
can
not
forget
that
the
peasants
were
eager
to
fight
for
the
new
russian
regime
because
they
identified
it
with
their
new
property
in
land
the
situation
is
absurd
enough
men
in
hundreds
of
thousands
willing
to
fight
for
communist
masters
because
by
so
doing
they
believe
they
can
secure
themselves
in
an
absolute
form
of
property
but
that
is
what
the
red
army
was
in
that
belt
of
nations
vague
in
boundary
which
used
to
constitute
the
marches
of
the
east
and
which
now
stand
between
what
was
once
the
russian
empire
and
the
germanies
the
position
would
seem
to
be
this
there
are
in
these
countries
everywhere
a
very
large
proportion
of
jews
the
largest
by
far
are
in
lithuania
and
galicia
where
of
whole
towns
from
a
third
to
a
half
and
sometimes
up
to
of
the
population
are
jewish
very
large
also
is
the
proportion
within
the
admitted
frontiers
of
modern
poland
very
large
in
roumania
and
considerable
in
hungary
in
all
these
countries
the
jewish
problem
is
something
quite
different
from
what
it
is
farther
west
the
jews
are
in
these
countries
admittedly
a
separate
nation
even
as
i
write
i
hear
the
complaint
sounding
strange
in
our
western
ears
proffered
by
the
polish
jews
who
have
been
appealing
to
the
west
against
what
they
claim
to
be
the
oppressive
practice
of
writing
them
down
as
poles
in
roumania
for
two
generations
it
has
been
the
fixed
principle
of
the
state
now
latent
now
overt
but
always
acted
upon
in
social
practice
that
the
jew
is
not
a
roumanian
at
all
and
can
not
be
one
of
course
he
can
not
be
one
really
any
more
than
he
can
be
an
englishman
or
a
frenchman
or
an
irishman
fancy
a
jew
an
irishman
but
i
mean
not
even
one
by
fiction
or
by
convention
in
poland
the
greater
part
of
these
people
have
a
different
language
and
all
of
them
have
a
different
social
custom
and
a
different
life
from
the
world
around
them
in
hungary
where
the
numerical
pressure
of
the
jew
is
less
there
is
of
course
a
most
lively
memory
of
the
attempted
revolution
under
cohen
in
the
massacres
of
hungarians
the
setting
up
of
an
ephemeral
bolshevism
and
the
necessity
of
its
suppression
in
bohemia
the
pressure
is
far
less
and
in
the
balkan
states
south
of
the
danube
and
the
drave
it
is
only
present
as
a
pressure
of
numbers
in
the
group
of
states
which
lie
between
the
baltic
and
the
black
sea
south
and
north
and
between
the
russian
people
and
the
german
people
east
and
west
when
we
come
to
occidental
europe
in
which
must
be
included
though
it
is
hardly
a
true
part
of
it
germany
beyond
the
elbe
when
we
come
to
the
scandinavian
countries
to
france
britain
italy
spain
switzerland
and
the
low
countries
the
problem
changes
the
numerical
proportion
of
jews
sinks
enormously
fairly
large
in
one
or
two
dutch
towns
it
is
almost
insignificant
in
scandinavia
and
though
we
have
had
into
the
great
english
towns
and
to
some
extent
into
the
northern
french
towns
particularly
paris
a
considerable
recent
influx
of
jews
yet
the
total
number
of
these
people
in
the
west
remains
far
far
smaller
than
the
great
masses
of
the
east
of
europe
the
same
is
still
more
true
of
italy
and
in
spite
of
the
absorption
of
a
great
deal
of
jewish
blood
in
the
past
of
spain
but
while
the
numerical
proportion
of
jews
in
these
western
countries
is
much
smaller
and
while
therefore
the
peril
of
jewish
domination
is
very
different
in
from
what
it
is
farther
east
it
is
clearly
marked
it
is
exercised
primarily
through
finance
next
through
the
sceptical
universities
the
anonymous
press
and
the
corrupt
parliaments
and
lastly
in
a
more
general
form
by
the
presence
of
institutions
which
greatly
favour
the
rise
of
the
jew
in
competition
with
his
hosts
each
favours
international
knowledge
each
favours
anonymity
each
still
favours
the
old
liberal
nonsense
which
called
itself
toleration
and
was
really
an
indifference
to
that
most
fundamental
of
all
social
motives
religion
save
of
course
where
an
exception
is
made
to
permit
attack
upon
the
catholic
church
under
influence
of
this
sort
both
sincere
and
hypocritical
both
generous
and
mean
the
jew
acquired
in
all
the
larger
communities
and
especially
in
france
italy
germany
and
england
a
power
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
numbers
and
i
may
add
without
i
hope
offending
any
jewish
reader
out
of
proportion
to
his
abilities
certainly
out
of
proportion
to
any
right
of
his
to
interfere
in
our
affairs
it
was
a
jew
who
produced
the
divorce
laws
in
france
the
jew
who
nourished
everywhere
in
that
country
and
also
in
italy
the
jew
who
called
in
the
forces
of
occidental
nations
to
protect
his
compatriots
in
the
east
and
the
jew
whose
spirit
has
so
largely
permeated
the
universities
and
the
press
ireland
is
an
exception
in
ireland
the
jew
outside
the
little
industrial
corner
in
the
is
nobody
and
here
it
must
be
remarked
that
the
migrations
of
the
jew
which
give
him
numbers
here
for
a
time
and
afterwards
numbers
elsewhere
in
places
where
previously
he
had
not
been
known
which
give
him
influence
here
for
a
time
and
sees
it
followed
by
the
decline
of
that
influence
do
not
seem
to
obey
any
law
which
we
can
trace
and
are
certainly
not
the
product
of
any
conscious
action
it
is
one
of
the
strangest
phenomena
in
history
this
odd
spasmodic
flood
movement
of
the
jewish
race
is
it
concerned
with
commerce
that
is
one
element
undoubtedly
that
is
what
explains
the
exploitation
of
england
by
jews
after
the
conquest
of
spain
in
the
later
middle
ages
of
the
valley
of
the
rhine
but
then
why
not
other
commercial
centres
as
an
attraction
venice
was
not
one
though
the
jew
was
well
tolerated
there
nor
was
paris
after
the
early
middle
ages
and
while
some
of
the
dutch
towns
formed
such
centres
of
attraction
the
belgian
towns
did
not
was
it
asylum
that
would
account
of
course
for
the
great
influx
of
jews
into
mediaeval
poland
but
then
why
not
into
eighteenth
century
england
why
not
until
very
late
in
the
nineteenth
century
england
which
gave
the
jews
a
more
complete
civic
position
than
he
could
find
anywhere
else
in
the
world
was
not
invaded
by
them
why
these
very
recent
influxes
into
the
united
states
which
has
for
now
a
century
and
a
half
been
perfectly
open
by
its
constitution
and
was
by
all
its
civic
tradition
an
ideal
asylum
for
the
jews
until
quite
recent
times
the
jew
was
hardly
known
there
and
to
this
day
he
is
not
known
outside
a
few
great
cities
no
there
would
seem
to
be
no
law
or
at
least
no
discoverable
law
for
this
mysterious
movement
the
ebb
and
flow
of
israel
but
that
is
a
digression
to
return
to
the
national
situations
if
we
leave
the
old
world
and
turn
to
the
united
states
we
find
a
novel
condition
of
affairs
still
in
process
of
development
and
very
puzzling
to
the
foreign
observer
i
do
not
pretend
to
analyse
it
completely
in
a
few
lines
nor
even
accurately
for
i
am
dependent
upon
the
observation
of
others
and
the
united
states
are
so
utterly
different
from
us
that
we
have
difficulty
in
following
their
contemporary
history
but
something
of
this
sort
would
seem
to
be
passing
there
in
the
united
states
the
jews
were
present
till
the
last
few
years
in
numbers
even
smaller
in
proportion
to
the
population
than
their
numbers
in
france
england
and
italy
far
smaller
than
their
numbers
in
what
was
formerly
the
german
empire
in
the
agricultural
part
of
america
which
is
still
i
believe
one
half
of
the
population
the
jew
was
almost
unknown
you
find
him
here
and
there
as
a
lawyer
or
a
storekeeper
but
that
world
was
not
familiar
with
him
any
more
than
our
english
are
familiar
with
him
with
the
growth
of
the
great
industrial
towns
of
course
the
jew
came
but
he
was
still
no
feature
in
the
landscape
there
was
a
certain
social
prejudice
against
him
among
the
wealthier
classes
in
the
east
and
this
is
very
important
truth
was
always
told
about
there
was
in
america
no
convention
the
jew
was
always
recognized
as
a
jew
and
there
was
never
any
of
the
nonsense
we
had
over
here
of
pretending
that
he
was
something
else
of
that
phenomenon
of
which
the
history
of
europe
is
full
which
is
so
marked
in
the
eastern
counties
and
which
is
beginning
to
rise
in
the
west
there
is
nothing
traceable
in
the
early
and
middle
nineteenth
century
nor
even
till
the
close
of
it
in
the
united
states
then
came
the
change
it
is
a
change
which
has
taken
place
in
the
lifetime
of
men
much
younger
than
myself
it
is
a
change
i
am
told
most
marked
since
i
last
visited
the
united
states
more
than
twenty
years
ago
a
regular
and
organized
jewish
emigration
began
to
pour
in
especially
from
the
baltic
it
flooded
new
york
where
it
now
forms
probably
a
third
of
the
population
it
created
ghettoes
in
most
of
the
large
northern
industrial
towns
and
all
the
phenomena
we
associate
in
europe
with
these
movements
began
to
show
themselves
there
was
the
growth
of
the
financial
monopoly
and
of
monopolies
in
particular
trades
there
was
the
clamour
for
toleration
in
the
form
of
neutralizing
religious
teaching
in
schools
there
was
the
appearance
of
the
jewish
revolutionary
and
of
the
jewish
critic
in
every
tradition
of
christian
life
the
jews
went
also
as
they
usually
do
to
the
heart
of
things
and
the
executive
was
attacked
the
last
and
apparently
the
most
unpopular
of
the
presidents
wilson
seems
to
have
been
wholly
in
their
hands
anonymity
in
the
press
came
of
course
a
very
marked
example
of
it
is
a
journal
called
new
which
though
it
has
but
a
small
proportion
of
jewish
writers
upon
it
and
though
its
capital
is
i
believe
not
jewish
is
yet
to
all
intents
and
purposes
the
organ
of
the
jewish
intellectuals
always
joins
in
the
boycott
of
any
news
unfavourable
to
european
jews
always
joins
in
the
clamour
for
anything
favourable
to
them
and
in
general
adheres
to
the
jewish
side
like
the
in
paris
or
let
us
say
new
in
england
but
the
novel
presence
in
the
united
states
of
this
phenomenon
with
which
in
the
west
of
europe
we
have
now
been
familiar
for
a
long
time
provides
a
more
direct
and
a
very
different
kind
of
reaction
from
what
it
has
among
us
this
reaction
against
jewish
powers
was
not
to
use
a
stock
exchange
metaphor
sticky
there
was
no
hesitation
there
were
no
uneasy
patches
of
silence
the
jewish
question
was
discussed
from
the
moment
it
was
first
felt
and
it
is
discussed
beyond
all
others
of
political
topics
i
have
found
it
the
first
in
the
conversation
of
the
americans
who
have
visited
europe
since
the
war
and
with
whom
i
have
discussed
the
affairs
of
their
country
it
ranges
as
that
reaction
always
does
from
the
wildest
to
strong
and
open
defence
of
the
jewish
position
not
only
by
jews
but
by
the
very
small
minority
of
their
admirers
outside
the
jewish
community
especially
among
the
wealthy
the
characteristic
of
the
whole
thing
in
the
united
states
is
that
it
is
only
just
beginning
it
is
capable
of
becoming
one
of
those
sudden
growths
of
which
the
past
history
of
the
republic
has
made
us
familiar
and
indeed
it
is
too
early
yet
to
judge
even
on
the
largest
lines
what
forms
it
may
not
take
it
is
enough
to
say
that
there
is
behind
the
reaction
against
the
jew
in
that
country
a
growing
intensity
of
feeling
with
which
we
as
yet
in
western
europe
for
all
the
advance
we
have
made
in
the
matter
are
unfamiliar
if
a
test
be
required
contrast
the
silence
about
the
jews
in
during
bryan
great
attack
upon
the
gold
standard
with
the
work
of
ford
and
all
that
he
stands
for
the
rest
of
the
world
is
either
of
islam
or
heathen
in
the
heathen
world
so
far
the
jew
has
little
place
he
has
a
strong
grip
on
india
of
course
but
only
through
the
british
raj
not
through
the
native
population
and
in
china
except
as
a
merchant
he
has
no
power
at
all
neither
has
he
over
the
strong
and
organized
nationality
of
japan
such
are
the
degrees
very
roughly
of
the
problem
such
the
differences
of
its
quality
in
the
various
national
groups
of
these
the
two
most
interesting
states
of
the
problem
by
far
because
they
are
changing
with
the
greatest
rapidity
are
found
in
france
in
england
and
in
the
united
states
i
have
said
that
the
second
modifying
condition
was
the
difference
of
civic
traditions
of
the
various
nations
here
again
you
have
a
differentiation
from
east
to
west
but
within
it
a
differentiation
ultimately
due
to
religion
from
north
to
south
in
russia
there
was
never
any
tradition
of
keeping
silence
upon
the
jew
or
of
respecting
the
jew
at
all
he
was
until
the
recent
revolution
the
national
enemy
and
there
was
the
end
of
it
similarly
in
poland
roumania
and
the
vaguer
populations
of
their
borders
and
even
in
the
old
hungary
the
jew
was
talked
of
openly
as
belonging
to
a
separate
nationality
and
on
the
whole
a
hostile
one
but
as
one
got
west
another
spirit
emerged
another
tradition
it
was
the
thing
to
treat
the
jew
as
a
citizen
this
fashion
was
weaker
in
the
germanies
than
in
the
low
countries
france
or
england
it
was
everywhere
present
west
of
the
elbe
it
was
a
tradition
flowing
from
two
sources
the
commercial
and
protestant
england
of
the
seventeenth
century
the
sceptical
france
of
the
eighteenth
the
jew
according
to
this
spirit
merited
special
protection
and
special
respect
he
must
be
protected
and
respected
even
in
his
passion
for
secrecy
so
that
at
last
the
mere
mention
of
his
existence
in
the
cultivated
and
directing
classes
of
the
west
became
something
of
an
oddity
from
this
spirit
proceeded
the
liberal
fiction
or
convention
which
i
dealt
with
in
the
second
chapter
of
this
book
it
was
clinched
it
was
given
permanent
form
by
the
enthusiasm
and
severe
doctrine
of
the
french
republicans
which
arose
at
a
moment
when
israel
was
regarded
as
a
religion
and
its
national
quality
was
forgotten
since
all
religion
was
thought
to
be
dying
since
further
an
enthusiasm
had
arisen
against
almost
any
religion
which
exercised
civic
power
notably
the
catholic
church
this
jewish
religion
formerly
regarded
as
inimical
to
the
state
or
at
any
rate
separate
from
it
was
naturally
accorded
a
special
privilege
that
strange
system
arose
the
death
of
which
we
are
now
watching
after
its
brief
life
of
somewhat
more
than
a
century
whereby
the
jew
was
permitted
to
wear
the
mask
of
nationalities
other
than
his
own
and
to
function
everywhere
as
though
he
were
a
citizen
not
of
israel
but
of
the
nation
in
which
he
chanced
to
find
himself
against
this
attitude
arose
at
last
the
powerful
plea
of
nationalism
in
england
as
we
shall
see
in
the
next
chapter
this
plea
was
less
strong
than
elsewhere
because
the
interests
of
international
jewish
finance
and
of
british
commerce
were
for
so
long
nearly
identical
in
italy
where
the
jew
was
naturally
closely
connected
with
the
nationalist
movement
on
account
of
its
antagonism
to
the
papacy
national
feeling
clashed
little
with
the
anomaly
of
the
jew
but
in
france
especially
after
the
defeat
of
the
contrast
became
stronger
and
stronger
just
as
it
is
strengthening
in
germany
after
the
defeat
of
it
was
that
clash
between
the
city
of
israel
and
the
other
cities
in
which
we
europeans
function
to
which
allusion
has
been
made
on
a
former
page
it
would
be
very
convenient
no
doubt
to
the
city
of
israel
if
all
other
cities
disappeared
and
left
an
open
field
for
jewish
operations
but
they
do
not
propose
to
disappear
and
though
our
devotion
to
them
may
seem
inexplicable
to
the
jew
he
must
accept
it
as
a
permanent
force
for
the
patriotism
of
the
european
will
not
weaken
in
the
united
states
this
liberal
tradition
or
convention
this
conception
that
the
jew
must
be
treated
as
a
full
citizen
was
far
stronger
even
than
it
was
in
the
west
of
europe
it
was
in
the
very
soul
of
the
constitution
and
what
is
more
important
in
the
very
soul
of
the
people
for
such
a
spirit
was
nourished
not
only
in
doctrine
but
in
practice
by
the
appearance
in
vast
quantities
of
immigrants
from
many
different
countries
all
of
whom
were
absorbed
in
and
merged
by
the
american
spirit
if
ever
there
was
a
field
in
which
the
false
conception
that
a
jew
could
be
a
jew
and
at
the
same
time
the
full
citizen
of
another
nation
that
field
was
the
united
states
of
america
yet
it
is
there
that
the
problem
is
now
reaching
its
most
acute
form
and
the
reason
is
that
side
by
side
with
this
strong
civic
tradition
there
goes
a
complete
freedom
of
speech
and
a
very
active
public
opinion
the
reality
became
too
much
for
theory
and
the
jew
was
recognized
as
something
apart
he
will
never
fall
into
the
background
again
there
remain
to
be
considered
the
international
forces
which
modify
this
general
truth
that
the
quarrel
with
the
jew
is
a
quarrel
with
his
increasing
control
over
our
affairs
those
international
forces
are
religion
islam
and
the
catholic
church
the
force
of
modern
capitalism
and
the
reaction
against
that
force
of
the
industrial
proletariat
the
reaction
summed
up
in
the
term
socialism
all
four
are
international
the
position
of
the
jew
in
islam
can
be
simply
defined
in
islam
he
is
treated
with
less
method
and
therefore
with
less
continued
oppression
than
in
christendom
but
always
and
permanently
as
something
base
and
inferior
save
in
a
few
rare
moments
when
he
has
the
favour
of
particular
rulers
or
is
necessary
to
some
special
society
or
is
admired
in
a
moment
of
intellectual
brilliance
normally
the
jew
in
islam
is
an
outcast
i
know
very
well
that
the
game
is
played
of
pretending
that
islam
is
in
some
way
kinder
to
him
than
we
are
it
is
but
a
game
the
playing
of
one
party
against
another
of
islam
against
christendom
by
israel
which
is
of
neither
in
islam
his
superior
position
in
christendom
is
equally
famed
history
is
too
strong
for
such
pretences
all
the
history
of
islam
all
the
social
spirit
of
islam
to
which
there
are
countless
witnesses
give
the
same
verdict
about
the
general
treatment
of
the
jew
in
that
society
so
it
was
in
independent
islam
but
islam
politically
controlled
by
the
western
christian
powers
is
another
matter
under
that
unstable
state
of
affairs
no
one
can
say
how
long
it
will
last
the
conflict
between
islam
and
christendom
seems
eternal
and
the
rise
and
fall
of
that
tide
is
indefinitely
successive
the
problem
takes
on
quite
another
shape
france
and
england
appear
in
islam
as
the
artificial
supporters
of
the
jew
until
quite
lately
it
was
the
french
who
bore
the
worst
odium
of
this
in
the
eyes
of
the
mohammedans
under
the
french
the
jews
in
north
africa
were
often
given
a
special
a
superior
position
which
was
an
insult
to
every
mohammedan
and
which
is
still
an
insult
to
him
it
is
the
weakest
point
of
the
french
regime
in
algeria
the
ghetto
jew
may
vote
the
arab
may
not
even
in
morocco
where
things
have
been
done
more
wisely
than
in
algiers
the
difficulty
is
felt
how
are
you
to
treat
a
jew
differently
in
morocco
from
the
way
in
which
he
is
treated
in
france
he
is
common
to
the
two
countries
if
you
treat
him
as
if
he
were
french
and
therefore
a
member
of
the
governing
power
what
of
the
pride
of
those
lords
of
the
atlas
and
of
fez
in
the
vastly
larger
field
of
mohammedan
control
exercised
by
britain
which
directly
and
indirectly
is
ten
times
that
of
france
there
was
until
lately
less
of
this
friction
but
the
tables
have
been
turned
and
it
is
britain
which
stands
to
the
mohammedan
as
the
of
the
jew
it
began
with
the
support
of
jewish
finance
in
egypt
it
went
on
with
the
extended
control
over
indian
commerce
by
jews
it
continued
in
the
control
of
indian
currency
by
jews
it
has
ended
in
the
grotesque
appointment
to
the
indian
viceroyalty
and
the
extraordinary
experiment
of
palestine
at
the
moment
in
which
i
write
there
is
no
doubt
on
the
matter
whatsoever
from
rabat
on
the
atlantic
to
the
bay
of
bengal
the
western
powers
are
regarded
as
the
agents
of
a
jewish
intrusion
which
is
intolerable
to
islam
and
whereas
the
chief
blame
lay
until
quite
a
few
years
ago
upon
the
french
it
lies
upon
the
british
government
the
rôle
of
the
catholic
church
in
the
debate
between
the
jews
and
christendom
is
the
most
discussed
the
worst
understood
of
any
point
connected
with
the
general
problem
but
it
is
capable
of
simple
definition
wherever
the
catholic
church
is
powerful
and
in
proportion
as
it
is
powerful
the
traditional
principles
of
the
civilization
of
which
it
is
the
soul
and
guardian
will
always
be
upheld
one
of
these
principles
is
the
sharp
distinction
between
the
jew
and
ourselves
the
rationalist
would
say
that
this
distinction
was
racial
and
that
it
only
found
religious
expression
on
account
of
its
racial
reality
his
opponent
would
say
that
the
origin
of
the
quarrel
was
mainly
religious
that
it
was
a
difference
in
religious
tradition
which
formed
the
contrast
between
the
jew
and
christendom
the
former
can
cite
as
evidence
the
violent
original
contrast
between
the
roman
empire
and
the
jew
the
latter
the
truth
that
religion
philosophy
is
the
formative
force
in
every
human
society
but
whichever
theory
you
adopt
the
fact
is
there
the
catholic
church
is
the
conservator
of
an
european
tradition
and
that
tradition
will
never
compromise
with
the
fiction
that
a
jew
can
be
other
than
a
jew
wherever
the
catholic
church
has
power
and
in
proportion
to
its
power
the
jewish
problem
will
be
recognized
to
the
full
on
the
other
hand
there
never
has
been
and
never
will
be
or
can
be
admission
by
catholic
morals
of
warfare
against
the
jew
those
morals
are
plain
that
doctrine
has
been
defined
over
and
over
again
and
acted
upon
throughout
history
if
indirect
hostilities
are
opened
against
the
majority
by
a
minority
in
its
midst
they
may
be
repressed
and
punished
still
more
important
insincere
and
pretended
conversion
used
as
a
cloak
may
be
repressed
and
punished
but
though
a
community
has
the
right
to
determine
its
own
life
and
if
it
think
it
possible
even
to
eliminate
with
justice
not
with
cruelty
violence
or
injustice
in
any
form
an
alien
a
hostile
minority
yet
that
minority
has
its
own
right
to
live
if
not
there
then
elsewhere
it
has
its
right
once
it
is
rooted
and
traditional
to
its
own
convictions
to
its
own
tradition
if
you
allow
it
to
live
among
you
you
must
allow
it
to
live
its
own
life
save
where
that
life
threatens
yours
the
catholic
church
will
always
maintain
reality
including
the
reality
of
that
sharp
distinction
between
the
jew
and
his
hosts
the
opponent
of
the
catholic
church
will
tend
other
things
being
equal
to
support
the
jew
because
under
that
distinction
the
jew
may
find
himself
ill
at
ease
the
whole
protestant
tradition
of
the
north
was
for
more
than
years
favourable
to
the
jew
partly
indeed
on
account
of
its
reliance
upon
the
jewish
scriptures
its
absorption
in
the
inspired
jewish
but
more
because
the
alliance
with
the
jew
was
an
alliance
against
the
catholic
church
strong
traces
of
that
spirit
still
remain
what
has
warred
against
it
has
been
the
sheer
necessity
in
every
country
catholic
or
protestant
liberal
or
to
preserve
society
against
what
each
began
to
feel
as
a
disruptive
and
an
alien
domination
there
remain
the
two
novel
forces
modern
capitalism
and
protesting
against
it
its
victim
the
modern
industrial
proletariat
a
few
years
ago
anyone
would
have
said
that
the
opposition
to
the
jew
was
an
opposition
to
capitalism
alone
the
jew
was
the
representative
of
capitalism
and
jewish
finance
was
the
particular
aspect
of
jewish
power
in
which
that
power
was
universally
hated
but
we
have
seen
all
that
change
the
strongest
force
against
the
jew
is
on
the
other
side
it
is
mainly
aroused
not
by
the
fear
of
capitalist
forces
but
by
the
fear
of
revolutionary
forces
i
make
bold
to
say
that
when
the
feeling
against
the
jew
comes
to
the
point
of
action
the
jew
will
necessarily
and
in
fall
back
upon
the
leadership
of
the
proletariat
against
industrial
capitalism
he
will
he
must
from
mere
instinct
quite
apart
from
calculation
use
the
line
of
cleavage
which
divides
a
society
hostile
to
him
he
will
rely
on
the
line
of
cleavage
driven
by
the
vast
modern
quarrel
between
the
few
possessors
in
the
modern
industrial
world
and
their
victims
the
exploited
millions
so
put
the
opportunity
of
the
jew
if
he
be
driven
to
extremities
to
raise
an
army
in
his
defence
seems
a
great
opportunity
enough
it
would
seem
easy
for
him
to
deflect
all
animosity
against
himself
into
animosity
against
the
rich
safeguarding
of
course
as
he
has
done
in
russia
the
jewish
rich
but
we
must
remember
three
formidable
conditions
which
weaken
that
opportunity
the
first
condition
is
this
the
industrial
millions
are
still
quite
a
small
minority
and
will
probably
in
the
future
be
an
even
smaller
minority
of
the
civilized
white
world
the
war
dealt
them
a
heavy
blow
the
fact
that
the
industrial
proletariat
is
a
town
population
and
therefore
less
and
less
productive
is
another
cause
of
weakness
their
decline
in
health
another
the
fact
that
industrial
capitalism
depends
upon
the
machine
being
kept
going
and
that
its
serfs
are
less
and
less
willing
to
keep
the
machine
going
is
another
secondly
the
area
and
that
is
important
occupied
by
industrial
capitalism
is
but
a
very
small
area
of
the
surface
of
the
civilized
world
thirdly
the
revolt
of
the
industrial
proletariat
if
the
jews
provoke
it
will
be
either
it
will
be
defeated
or
after
destroying
its
masters
it
will
under
jewish
leadership
destroy
its
own
powers
of
production
as
in
russia
when
the
fury
is
exhausted
in
a
very
short
time
the
jewish
problem
will
reappear
the
proletarian
battle
may
rage
intensely
but
it
will
be
far
from
universal
and
will
not
be
sufficient
i
think
to
distract
mankind
from
that
other
of
jew
and
to
which
his
attention
is
being
more
and
more
steadily
directed
footnote
except
of
course
an
outlawed
member
the
case
of
levy
turned
out
of
this
country
by
his
compatriots
in
the
government
for
having
written
unfavourably
of
the
moscow
jews
will
be
fresh
in
every
memory
the
position
of
the
jews
in
england
chapter
x
the
present
relation
between
the
english
state
and
the
jews
the
various
nations
of
europe
have
every
one
of
them
in
the
course
of
their
long
histories
passed
through
successive
phases
towards
the
jew
which
i
have
called
the
tragic
cycle
each
has
in
turn
welcomed
tolerated
persecuted
attempted
to
exile
often
actually
exiled
welcomed
again
and
so
forth
the
two
chief
examples
of
extremes
in
action
are
as
i
have
also
pointed
out
in
an
earlier
part
of
this
book
spain
and
england
spaniards
and
in
particular
the
spaniards
of
the
kingdom
of
castile
went
through
every
phase
of
this
cycle
in
its
fullest
form
england
passed
through
even
greater
extremes
for
england
was
the
only
country
which
absolutely
got
rid
of
the
jews
for
hundreds
of
years
and
england
is
the
only
country
which
has
even
for
a
brief
period
entered
into
something
like
an
alliance
with
them
though
it
is
the
present
position
of
the
british
state
that
is
the
position
of
official
british
politics
towards
the
jew
with
which
we
are
concerned
it
may
be
of
service
to
introduce
the
matter
by
a
word
upon
past
relations
the
jewish
element
in
this
island
whatever
it
may
have
been
during
the
roman
occupation
was
of
small
account
during
the
dark
ages
things
changed
at
their
close
in
the
eleventh
century
the
jew
is
the
camp
follower
of
each
new
economic
movement
among
us
and
that
is
why
one
finds
him
in
the
wake
of
the
norman
conquest
throughout
the
economic
development
which
it
began
appears
the
secondary
rôle
of
the
jew
every
one
knows
the
mediaeval
rule
of
jewish
status
it
was
established
here
as
everywhere
else
in
christendom
the
jew
was
the
king
that
is
under
the
special
protection
of
the
state
if
he
were
the
subject
of
popular
attack
that
attack
was
an
attack
on
the
king
peculiar
and
liable
to
speedy
repression
the
individual
attacker
was
punished
with
special
severity
because
the
danger
of
is
always
great
where
the
populace
is
free
to
act
in
masses
as
it
was
throughout
the
middle
ages
and
the
necessity
for
preventing
individual
attacks
from
spreading
was
correspondingly
great
now
and
then
the
popular
feeling
got
out
of
hand
and
the
monarch
had
to
deal
with
numbers
which
he
could
not
control
but
as
a
rule
the
jew
especially
the
rich
jew
enjoyed
a
privileged
position
both
in
northern
france
and
throughout
england
the
jew
of
the
early
middle
ages
in
england
was
normally
a
man
and
often
an
exceedingly
rich
man
then
as
now
a
small
number
of
jews
were
much
the
richest
men
of
their
time
he
had
most
of
the
finances
in
his
hands
and
this
immense
privilege
which
he
has
lost
that
he
alone
was
allowed
to
practise
usury
here
we
must
pause
a
moment
to
define
usury
usury
then
as
now
signified
the
receiving
of
interest
upon
unproductive
loans
it
is
a
practice
which
all
moralists
and
all
philosophers
have
condemned
and
which
the
church
in
particular
condemns
if
you
lend
money
to
a
man
for
a
productive
purpose
if
for
instance
he
is
to
buy
a
ship
and
trade
with
the
money
you
advance
or
to
buy
a
farm
and
grow
produce
then
of
course
you
are
perfectly
free
to
stipulate
for
a
portion
of
the
profit
but
if
you
lend
the
money
for
a
purpose
not
directly
productive
as
for
instance
to
a
man
in
grave
necessity
or
in
lieu
of
charity
or
to
build
such
a
building
as
a
church
which
will
not
produce
a
rent
or
if
in
any
other
fashion
you
lend
money
to
one
who
to
your
knowledge
will
not
spend
it
in
some
reproductive
agency
then
it
is
immoral
to
demand
interest
now
an
exception
was
made
in
mediaeval
christendom
in
favour
of
the
jew
he
was
allowed
to
lend
money
at
interest
even
in
the
most
grievous
cases
of
necessity
and
for
services
as
unproductive
as
religion
or
war
the
only
stipulation
was
that
the
moneys
saved
from
this
lucrative
practice
returned
to
the
crown
in
theory
upon
the
death
of
the
licensee
in
practice
no
doubt
a
very
large
part
remained
with
the
accumulator
who
during
his
lifetime
was
enjoying
the
income
he
had
acquired
by
usury
who
could
give
it
to
his
heirs
while
still
living
and
could
use
opportunities
for
secret
investment
or
pass
it
to
the
custody
of
others
throughout
international
jewry
but
liquid
sums
left
by
him
the
product
of
his
usury
returned
to
the
crown
upon
his
death
this
was
a
great
advantage
to
the
crown
not
only
in
protecting
the
jew
from
the
native
hostility
of
his
alien
hosts
and
particularly
of
the
populace
but
in
giving
him
that
great
privilege
a
monopoly
the
rate
of
interest
was
enormous
it
varied
from
nearly
per
cent
to
over
per
cent
when
jews
lent
money
on
security
the
king
was
party
to
the
safe
custody
of
the
security
and
their
privilege
extended
so
far
that
they
were
exempt
from
the
common
law
and
a
case
between
an
englishman
and
his
jewish
creditor
could
only
be
tried
by
a
mixed
jury
in
which
the
jew
own
compatriots
were
present
in
equal
numbers
with
the
english
all
during
the
angevin
period
jewish
financial
domination
continued
up
to
the
end
of
the
twelfth
century
and
even
into
the
beginning
of
the
thirteenth
but
with
the
first
half
of
the
thirteenth
century
for
some
reason
of
which
i
have
never
seen
a
sufficient
historical
analysis
and
of
which
perhaps
the
full
causes
have
been
lost
the
jewish
power
began
to
decline
very
rapidly
so
far
as
england
was
concerned
and
here
it
may
be
noted
that
the
misfortunes
of
the
jews
in
any
country
never
begin
until
their
financial
position
is
shaken
as
long
as
they
are
the
financial
masters
of
the
government
they
are
protected
but
woe
to
them
when
they
begin
to
lose
their
financial
power
then
there
is
no
longer
any
reason
for
supporting
them
either
on
the
part
of
the
governing
classes
in
general
or
of
the
executive
in
particular
popular
passion
is
let
loose
and
disaster
follows
at
any
rate
the
thirteenth
century
saw
in
england
a
rapid
decline
of
jewish
financial
power
and
at
the
same
time
a
rapid
rise
of
official
animosity
towards
them
they
got
poorer
and
poorer
as
the
century
proceeded
their
activities
were
at
the
same
time
more
and
more
restricted
they
had
lent
money
largely
upon
land
and
yet
in
the
public
interest
were
at
last
forbidden
to
foreclose
upon
it
the
final
step
came
when
their
special
licence
to
practise
usury
was
withdrawn
by
edward
i
in
the
earlier
part
of
his
reign
and
at
last
in
after
increasing
severities
they
were
all
expelled
the
country
under
penalty
of
death
the
unhappy
people
already
reduced
by
two
generations
of
falling
fortune
were
hurried
out
of
the
country
carrying
by
permission
their
money
and
movables
they
were
protected
indeed
at
the
ports
by
the
royal
officers
who
even
paid
the
passage
of
the
indigent
among
them
but
they
were
plundered
at
sea
and
some
even
murdered
the
murderers
were
punished
but
the
memory
of
the
persecution
remained
in
the
mind
and
england
became
a
natural
object
of
their
hate
the
jewish
community
expelled
by
the
english
was
surprisingly
small
not
and
suggests
the
historical
truth
that
in
the
middle
ages
and
indeed
until
quite
modern
times
the
jewish
community
in
northern
france
and
england
was
a
community
of
people
in
the
main
it
so
remained
until
quite
modern
times
there
followed
three
and
a
half
centuries
and
more
during
which
england
was
the
one
example
in
europe
of
a
state
that
would
not
tolerate
the
jews
upon
any
terms
whatsoever
there
certainly
remained
throughout
this
time
or
at
any
rate
visited
the
island
not
a
few
of
what
the
jews
themselves
called
that
is
jews
who
outwardly
deny
their
nationality
and
practise
our
religion
for
the
purpose
of
private
gain
these
when
they
could
defeat
the
law
successfully
remained
within
the
british
seas
but
their
effect
was
slight
and
the
english
people
during
the
whole
of
their
great
military
advance
in
france
during
the
whole
period
when
their
language
and
culture
was
forming
during
the
whole
great
national
episode
of
the
tudors
and
of
the
reformation
formed
the
one
great
exception
out
of
all
europe
in
that
the
jew
remained
unknown
to
them
and
was
rigorously
excluded
from
their
commonwealth
they
returned
as
everybody
knows
under
cromwell
their
numbers
and
still
more
their
wealth
increased
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
century
and
concomitantly
with
this
partly
as
an
effect
of
it
but
here
we
must
not
exaggerate
a
number
of
novel
financial
features
appeared
in
the
english
state
each
of
which
shows
the
increased
power
of
the
jews
the
institution
of
the
bank
of
the
national
debt
of
speculation
in
exchange
and
in
the
fluctuation
of
stock
but
the
real
causes
of
that
alliance
between
the
english
and
the
jews
which
is
seen
in
the
late
seventeenth
century
which
quickened
throughout
the
eighteenth
and
became
so
very
marked
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
the
cosmopolitan
position
of
england
as
the
leading
commercial
state
this
it
was
which
led
to
something
like
identity
between
the
interests
of
israel
and
the
interests
of
britain
an
identity
which
has
lasted
so
long
that
now
when
divergence
is
beginning
to
appear
it
still
seems
odd
and
novel
to
the
older
generation
that
there
should
be
any
jewish
action
which
is
not
favourable
to
england
they
can
not
understand
what
the
new
indifference
to
jewish
interests
let
alone
the
new
hostility
to
them
can
mean
there
were
of
course
many
other
causes
contributory
to
the
peculiar
position
which
the
jew
came
to
enjoy
in
modern
england
a
position
which
he
has
not
yet
lost
in
external
circumstance
though
it
is
so
badly
shaken
morally
there
was
the
fact
that
england
was
the
protestant
power
of
the
west
this
religious
motive
played
a
great
part
between
the
catholic
church
and
the
synagogue
there
had
been
hostility
from
the
first
century
in
so
far
as
it
was
possible
to
take
sides
in
that
quarrel
it
was
natural
for
the
protestant
power
to
take
sides
against
the
catholic
tradition
and
therefore
in
favour
of
the
jews
again
the
english
were
not
only
protestant
their
middle
classes
were
steeped
in
the
reading
of
the
old
testament
the
jews
seemed
to
them
the
heroes
of
an
epic
and
the
shrines
of
a
religion
you
will
find
strong
relics
of
this
attitude
in
provincial
england
to
this
day
one
should
add
a
certain
national
distaste
for
violence
which
feeling
was
exasperated
by
hearing
of
the
jewish
persecution
abroad
one
should
also
further
add
the
pride
which
modern
englishmen
take
in
the
feeling
that
their
country
is
an
asylum
for
the
oppressed
meanwhile
there
was
not
until
quite
lately
any
considerable
body
of
poor
jews
in
the
country
to
excite
the
animosity
of
the
populace
that
was
an
important
negative
factor
in
bringing
the
jew
within
the
boundaries
of
the
english
state
but
with
all
these
factors
fully
considered
it
remains
true
that
the
main
cause
of
the
accidental
jewish
position
in
england
was
the
cosmopolitan
character
of
english
commerce
and
the
essentially
commercial
character
of
the
english
state
as
english
export
and
english
shipping
began
to
cover
the
globe
the
english
financial
system
covered
it
as
well
london
became
after
waterloo
the
money
market
and
the
clearing
house
of
the
world
the
interests
of
the
jew
as
a
financial
dealer
and
the
interests
of
this
great
commercial
polity
approximated
more
and
more
one
may
say
that
by
the
last
third
of
the
nineteenth
century
they
had
become
virtually
identical
every
new
economic
enterprise
of
the
british
state
appealed
to
the
jewish
genius
for
commerce
and
especially
for
negotiation
in
its
most
abstract
form
finance
conversely
every
jewish
enterprise
every
new
conception
of
the
jew
in
his
cosmopolitan
activities
until
these
became
revolutionary
appealed
to
the
english
merchant
and
banker
the
two
things
dovetailed
one
into
the
other
and
fitted
exactly
and
all
subsidiary
activities
fitted
in
as
well
the
jewish
news
agencies
of
the
nineteenth
century
favoured
england
in
all
her
policy
political
as
well
as
commercial
they
opposed
those
of
her
rivals
and
especially
those
of
her
enemies
the
jewish
knowledge
of
the
east
was
at
the
service
of
england
his
international
penetration
of
the
european
governments
was
also
at
her
service
so
was
his
secret
information
with
the
consolidation
of
the
indian
empire
after
the
mutiny
the
jews
were
again
an
ally
from
their
traditional
hatred
of
the
russian
people
which
hatred
has
led
them
in
our
time
to
wreak
so
awful
a
vengeance
upon
their
former
oppressors
the
jew
might
almost
be
called
a
british
agent
upon
the
continent
of
europe
and
still
more
in
the
near
and
far
east
where
the
economic
power
of
england
extended
even
more
rapidly
than
her
political
power
and
the
jew
pointed
to
the
english
state
as
that
one
in
which
all
that
his
nation
required
of
the
was
to
be
found
he
here
enjoyed
a
situation
the
like
of
which
he
could
not
hope
to
enjoy
in
any
other
country
of
the
world
all
antagonism
to
him
had
died
down
he
was
admitted
to
every
institution
in
the
state
a
prominent
member
of
his
nation
became
chief
officer
of
the
english
executive
and
an
influence
more
subtle
and
penetrating
marriages
began
to
take
place
wholesale
between
what
had
once
been
the
aristocratic
territorial
families
of
this
country
and
the
jewish
commercial
fortunes
after
two
generations
of
this
with
the
opening
of
the
twentieth
century
those
of
the
great
territorial
english
families
in
which
there
was
no
jewish
blood
were
the
exception
in
nearly
all
of
them
was
the
strain
more
or
less
marked
in
some
of
them
so
strong
that
though
the
name
was
still
an
english
name
and
the
traditions
those
of
a
purely
english
lineage
of
the
long
past
the
physique
and
character
had
become
wholly
jewish
and
the
members
of
the
family
were
taken
for
jews
whenever
they
travelled
in
countries
where
the
gentry
had
not
yet
suffered
or
enjoyed
this
admixture
specially
jewish
institutions
such
as
freemasonry
which
the
jews
had
inaugurated
as
a
sort
of
bridge
between
themselves
and
their
hosts
in
the
seventeenth
century
were
particularly
strong
in
britain
and
there
arose
a
political
tradition
active
and
ultimately
to
prove
of
great
importance
whereby
the
british
state
was
tacitly
accepted
by
foreign
governments
as
the
official
protector
of
the
jews
in
other
countries
it
was
britain
which
was
expected
to
interfere
within
the
measure
of
her
power
whenever
a
persecution
of
the
jews
took
place
in
the
east
of
christendom
to
support
the
jewish
financial
energies
throughout
the
world
and
to
receive
in
return
the
benefit
of
that
connection
we
shall
have
a
most
imperfect
picture
of
the
causes
which
gradually
made
the
jews
regard
this
country
as
their
centre
of
action
if
we
omit
one
essential
point
england
was
secure
during
the
whole
period
which
saw
the
rise
of
the
jews
to
eminence
in
this
island
and
their
ultimate
alliance
with
its
political
and
commercial
system
english
society
enjoyed
a
profound
peace
save
for
the
petty
incidents
of
the
and
the
first
of
no
effect
south
of
the
border
the
second
ephemeral
and
confined
to
the
north
no
hostilities
took
place
upon
english
soil
between
the
rebellion
of
monmouth
under
james
ii
and
the
bombarding
of
london
by
the
germans
from
the
air
during
the
late
war
there
has
been
save
for
some
quite
insignificant
local
riots
complete
security
for
property
and
especially
for
large
property
there
have
been
since
the
middle
of
the
eighteenth
century
no
confiscations
and
of
commercial
fortunes
none
since
the
middle
of
the
seventeenth
no
invasion
no
civil
war
and
therefore
no
loot
no
personal
danger
from
violence
such
conditions
formed
an
environment
ideal
for
the
permanent
establishment
and
rooting
of
jewish
power
and
for
the
organization
of
a
jewish
base
the
political
situation
reflected
itself
as
it
always
does
in
literature
the
jew
began
to
appear
in
english
fiction
as
an
exalted
character
quite
specially
removed
to
his
advantage
from
the
mass
of
mankind
he
is
already
a
hero
in
sir
walter
scott
but
the
full
development
was
much
later
you
could
still
have
a
jewish
villain
as
late
as
but
with
writers
as
different
as
charles
reade
and
george
eliot
we
reach
a
time
where
the
jew
is
impeccable
the
worst
any
writer
dares
do
at
the
end
of
the
process
is
to
be
silent
the
best
is
to
flatter
the
jewish
type
out
of
all
knowledge
this
singular
interlude
was
in
part
due
to
the
divorce
between
literature
and
popular
feeling
in
the
middle
and
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
at
least
it
was
permitted
by
that
divorce
but
the
active
cause
of
it
was
the
reflection
of
the
jew
political
position
upon
the
mind
of
the
educated
class
as
expressed
in
its
literary
art
at
the
same
time
a
parallel
movement
appeared
on
the
historical
side
of
literature
a
convention
arose
that
in
the
clash
between
the
jews
and
the
english
of
the
middle
ages
the
jews
were
invariably
right
and
the
english
invariably
wrong
where
the
struggle
was
between
the
jew
and
the
abroad
the
historian
exceeded
all
bounds
the
european
hostile
to
the
jew
was
a
senseless
monster
and
the
jew
hostile
to
the
european
was
a
holy
victim
the
whole
story
of
europe
and
of
this
country
in
so
far
as
it
was
affected
by
this
very
considerable
factor
was
distorted
through
suppression
and
false
emphasis
and
quite
exceptional
lying
the
general
reader
of
history
neither
knew
what
part
the
jewish
question
had
played
nor
the
claims
that
could
be
advanced
for
his
own
race
in
the
conflict
and
as
historians
live
by
copying
one
another
the
legend
was
established
in
every
school
and
college
at
the
end
of
the
process
the
jews
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
held
a
power
in
this
country
beyond
anything
that
has
been
seen
in
any
other
of
the
world
poland
at
the
end
of
the
middle
ages
when
that
country
was
most
nearly
comparable
to
britain
for
the
harbouring
and
support
of
the
jewish
people
is
the
only
parallel
and
that
a
remote
one
every
english
government
had
and
has
its
quota
of
jews
they
had
entered
the
diplomatic
service
and
the
house
of
lords
they
swarmed
in
the
house
of
commons
in
the
universities
in
all
the
government
offices
save
the
foreign
office
and
even
there
representatives
of
the
jewish
nation
have
recently

were
exceedingly
powerful

the
press
they
were
in
the
city
no
custom
unsympathetic
to
their
race
from
the
duel
to
popular
clamour
survived
they
could
boast
that
england
was
not
only
the
country
where
no
distinction
whatever
was
made
in
practice
let
alone
in
law
between
the
jew
and
the
native
but
that
england
was
the
only
country
where
the
jew
was
always
well
received
where
his
natural
defects
counted
least
and
where
his
natural
abilities
had
most
scope
such
a
state
of
affairs
could
not
last
it
was
not
natural
it
was
not
consonant
with
hidden
but
deep
popular
tradition
or
with
popular
appetites
it
corresponded
only
to
the
mood
of
one
european
community
in
its
wealthier
classes
a
divergence
between
the
cosmopolitan
financial
interests
of
the
jew
and
the
particular
national
interests
of
britain
was
bound
to
come
war
on
a
large
scale
though
it
did
not
imperil
the
country
itself
was
a
warning
of
change
it
appeared
with
the
south
african
campaign
before
the
end
of
the
century
the
position
of
the
jew
was
altered
some
dissatisfaction
with
his
power
began
to
stir
it
was
already
muttering
and
beginning
to
show
itself
with
the
rise
of
commercial
and
maritime
competition
in
the
new
german
empire
which
in
its
turn
had
become
led
upon
all
its
commercial
side
by
jews
there
was
bound
i
say
to
be
a
reaction
and
a
permanent
one
while
it
was
yet
taking
place
in
the
heat
of
the
great
war
before
it
had
reached
the
official
world
that
one
of
the
english
politicians
who
was
best
fitted
to
speak
for
the
jews
who
was
most
intimate
with
them
through
manifold
ties
of
friendship
and
hospitality
arthur
balfour
was
chosen
to
make
the
famous
pronouncement
in
favour
of
zionism
it
came
within
a
month
of
the
great
crisis
of
the
war
its
object
was
to
divide
the
general
influence
of
the
jews
throughout
the
world
which
had
hitherto
been
upon
the
whole
opposed
to
the
cause
of
the
allies
because
like
every
other
neutral
the
jews
were
more
and
more
convinced
as
the
campaigns
dragged
on
that
the
central
empires
were
certain
of
victory
though
this
was
the
motive
the
effect
was
to
tie
the
british
state
yet
closer
to
the
fortunes
of
israel
for
here
was
england
pledged
to
support
to
defend
to
act
as
a
special
protector
over
the
peculiar
interests
of
the
jews
just
where
those
interests
would
most
challenge
the
whole
of
christendom
and
of
islam
just
where
it
would
be
most
acutely
difficult
to
confirm
jewish
claims
the
declaration
in
favour
of
zionism
the
solemn
pledge
of
the
forces
of
the
british
state
to
an
exceptional
support
of
the
jew
in
a
matter
wholly
to
his
benefit
and
not
in
any
way
to
that
of
england
coming
though
it
did
after
the
climax
of
jewish
power
had
been
reached
and
passed
was
the
last
stage
of
that
long
process
of
alliance
between
the
british
commercial
policy
and
its
ruling
classes
on
the
one
hand
and
the
jews
upon
the
other
already
as
i
have
said
that
alliance
was
morally
shaken
the
great
influx
of
poor
jews
had
shaken
it
the
mere
effect
of
time
the
inevitable
revolt
of
the
human
conscience
against
an
unnatural
pretence
and
an
obvious
fiction
was
bound
to
come
and
was
overdue
but
although
the
alliance
was
already
shaken
the
english
state
remained
officially
closely
interlocked
with
jewry
and
its
last
action
the
demand
for
the
establishment
of
a
jewish
state
in
palestine
was
as
has
so
often
happened
in
the
story
of
human
development
at
once
the
term
and
the
of
a
process
which
had
reached
its
conclusion
for
it
will
be
remarked
throughout
history
that
any
force
is
most
expressive
its
manifestation
of
power
most
crude
and
most
emphatic
in
the
perilous
interval
its
real
strength
has
begun
to
decline
and
its
first
open
defeat
but
the
problems
presented
by
this
experiment
in
palestine
merit
a
separate
examination
to
this
i
will
now
turn
zionism
chapter
xi
zionism
the
question
of
zionism
has
been
discussed
from
every
possible
aspect
save
one
and
that
one
is
the
only
factor
which
relates
to
the
thesis
of
this
book
it
has
been
argued
as
a
purely
jewish
matter
there
has
been
debate
upon
its
justice
or
injustice
among
the
jews
themselves
as
to
its
advantage
or
disadvantage
to
their
race
debate
among
the
various
forces
concerned
as
to
the
advantage
or
disadvantage
it
would
be
to
them
debate
upon
the
rights
and
wrongs
of
the
native
population
among
which
the
jews
might
find
a
home
debate
as
to
whether
that
home
should
be
in
palestine
or
elsewhere
and
so
on
all
these
discussions
avoid
the
ultimate
issue
some
of
them
of
course
are
of
evident
importance
within
the
jewish
community
but
so
far
as
the
essential
problem
we
are
discussing
in
this
book
is
concerned
they
do
not
apply
the
one
question
which
is
at
issue
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
thesis
is
this
the
zionist
experiment
will
tend
to
increase
or
to
relax
the
strain
created
by
the
presence
of
the
jew
in
the
midst
of
a
that
and
that
only
is
our
concern
and
from
that
point
of
view
we
may
examine
the
theory
of
zionism
which
has
now
emerged
into
an
attempted
practice
first
let
us
consider
its
necessary
general
implications
the
implications
which
zionism
involves
no
matter
where
or
how
the
experiment
were
tried
the
zionist
theory
is
that
israel
would
benefit
if
of
its
many
millions
some
twelve
millions
counting
those
of
the
partly
jewish
fringe
who
are
sufficiently
jewish
to
make
one
with
the
race
a
core
say
a
tenth
were
to
have
a
fixed
territorial
city
a
country
of
their
own
a
habitation
this
country
wherever
it
might
be
chosen
should
be
as
far
as
possible
a
purely
jewish
state
as
jewish
one
of
its
exponents
has
said
as
england
is
english
now
suppose
the
place
chosen
were
we
may
say
had
been
an
empty
or
almost
undeveloped
country
and
supposing
the
jews
had
found
that
their
own
people
could
bear
the
expense
of
reaching
that
place
with
sufficient
capital
and
of
colonizing
it
in
large
numbers
supposing
a
small
state
of
a
million
to
a
million
and
a
half
inhabitants
to
be
thus
formed
to
be
wholly
jewish
in
character
and
independent
in
the
fullest
sense
the
question
immediately
arises
the
jews
throughout
the
world
be
a
to
regard
themselves
as
citizens
of
that
state
b
in
any
case
as
citizens
of
that
state
whether
they
willed
or
no
and
registered
as
such
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
registered
person
if
not
what
would
be
the
status
of
the
jew
outside
this
territorial
unit
which
he
had
chosen
to
be
much
more
than
a
symbol
of
his
national
unity
its
actual
seat
and
establishment
that
is
the
question
which
so
far
as
i
have
watched
the
discussion
everybody
hesitates
to
face
yet
that
is
the
question
which
will
have
to
be
faced
sooner
or
later
as
the
main
political
crux
of
the
whole
affair
observe
that
there
is
no
question
of
establishing
a
state
wherein
the
whole
or
even
the
great
mass
of
the
jewish
people
shall
reside
no
one
would
repudiate
such
an
idea
more
vigorously
than
the
chief
pioneers
of
zionism
the
great
mass
of
jews
would
of
course
ridicule
it
as
impracticable
and
refuse
it
as
extremely
undesirable
they
live
and
they
desire
to
live
following
their
present
interests
in
the
nations
among
whom
they
are
dispersed
they
live
and
they
desire
to
live
the
life
the
international
life
which
has
become
theirs
by
every
tradition
and
which
one
might
now
almost
call
instinctive
in
them
also
the
greater
part
of
them
desire
to
pursue
those
careers
which
go
with
such
a
life
especially
the
careers
of
negotiation
and
of
intermediary
work
they
not
only
feel
the
advantage
of
such
a
position
they
also
feel
a
need
and
appetite
for
such
a
condition
whatever
form
zionism
might
have
taken
before
it
appeared
in
its
present
experimental
form
whatever
was
said
of
the
theory
in
the
past
was
always
capital
the
jews
as
a
nation
would
remain
as
they
were
moving
among
all
the
peoples
the
new
zion
was
to
be
no
more
than
a
fixed
rallying
point
an
established
but
small
territorial
nationhood
which
should
do
no
more
than
proclaim
their
unity
it
follows
therefore
necessarily
that
the
great
mass
of
jews
outside
the
territorial
settlement
would
have
after
such
a
settlement
had
been
formed
to
obtain
a
definition
of
their
political
character
what
is
that
definition
to
be
i
think
myself
the
jews
would
answer
it
is
to
be
precisely
what
it
is
or
rather
what
it
has
been
in
the
occidental
nations
during
the
past
generation
that
is
the
jew
is
to
be
regarded
as
the
full
national
in
the
nation
in
which
he
happens
to
be
for
the
time
nothing
shall
debar
him
from
any
position
whatever
in
that
nation
he
shall
be
regarded
in
exactly
the
same
light
as
all
the
other
citizens
and
conversely
he
shall
obtain
no
privilege
in
countries
where
there
is
conscription
for
instance
he
shall
be
a
conscript
like
anybody
else
where
a
nation
in
which
he
happens
to
find
himself
goes
to
war
he
shall
be
compelled
to
risk
his
life
for
it
like
any
other
citizen
if
he
happens
a
year
or
two
before
the
war
to
have
settled
in
the
country
then
he
shall
be
equally
compelled
to
fight
for
the
enemy
against
his
former
country
he
shall
in
every
respect
be
regarded
by
a
legal
fiction
as
identical
with
the
community
in
which
he
happens
to
be
settled
for
the
moment
at
the
same
time
he
is
to
have
some
special
relation
with
the
jewish
he
and
he
alone
is
to
be
certainly
in
practice
and
of
right
in
legal
decisions
eligible
for
admission
to
that
city
for
office
in
it
his
opinion
is
to
count
in
the
conduct
of
that
state
wherever
he
may
personally
be
placed
in
the
world
he
is
to
regard
himself
indeed
that
is
inevitable
from
the
definition
of
the
new
state
as
personally
allied
to
it
if
not
a
member
of
it
he
can
not
dissociate
himself
from
its
fortunes
nor
be
indifferent
to
its
success
or
failure
he
must
in
effect
be
to
it
he
owes
it
allegiance
of
a
moral
kind
he
will
necessarily
be
in
much
the
same
position
as
are
men
of
irish
descent
in
the
colonies
in
england
and
in
the
united
states
to
the
surviving
and
now
increasing
remnant
of
their
race
which
has
clung
to
its
native
land
but
in
the
particular
case
of
the
jew
this
allegiance
will
not
diminish
with
time
it
will
remain
ever
vivacious
the
race
as
its
individual
components
pass
from
one
country
to
another
will
make
one
body
generation
after
generation
with
the
fixed
polity
settled
in
the
new
zion
that
certainly
is
the
ideal
as
i
hear
it
expressed
on
every
side
in
conversation
and
in
writing
by
the
jews
who
support
it
well
if
the
ideal
is
left
in
that
condition
and
it
is
admitted
to
be
in
practice
in
that
condition
it
will
result
in
a
grievous
prejudice
to
the
jewish
people
and
will
be
a
source
of
more
permanent
evil
to
them
than
any
other
policy
they
could
have
undertaken
it
will
emphasize
that
very
point
of
dual
allegiance
which
it
must
be
their
object
to
soften
if
the
jewish
problem
is
to
be
solved
the
existence
of
a
zionist
state
will
bring
into
relief
the
separate
character
of
the
jew
the
jewish
nation
will
no
longer
be
able
to
depend
for
one
of
its
defences
upon
the
indifference
or
the
ignorance
still
widely
present
among
its
hosts
whereas
before
the
experiment
was
attempted
many
of
those
hosts
could
forget
the
difference
between
him
and
them
many
had
no
experience
of
it
and
many
remarked
it
without
its
affecting
their
attitude
towards
the
jew
after
the
experiment
has
been
put
in
practice
there
must
necessarily
be
a
change
to
give
a
concrete
instance
no
one
could
in
his
anger
say
to
a
jew
you
disturb
our
repose
you
are
an
alien
element
in
our
community
you
must
leave
it
for
if
he
meant
that
he
was
at
the
same
time
condemning
his
victim
to
universal
exile
but
once
an
established
national
state
exists
once
you
have
in
the
world
a
considerable
number
say
a
million
and
a
half
jews
who
are
not
the
nationals
of
any
other
nation
but
are
the
citizens
of
a
jewish
nation
with
a
known
locality
an
organized
state
the
suggestion
of
exile
changes
its
meaning
the
opponent
of
the
jew
is
now
able
to
say
go
back
to
your
own
country
and
you
may
be
very
certain
that
he
say
that
unless
some
other
solution
than
the
legal
fiction
of
full
citizenship
in
one
country
and
of
moral
allegiance
to
another
is
dropped
the
presence
of
the
new
zion
will
do
for
the
jewish
people
what
a
frame
does
for
a
picture
it
will
not
be
universal
to
them
it
will
not
cover
the
whole
field
of
jewish
activity
it
will
be
but
a
fraction
of
the
whole
but
it
will
inevitably
emphasize
the
separation
the
individual
and
alien
character
of
the
whole
it
will
concentrate
attention
upon
all
those
things
which
the
nineteenth
century
in
what
i
have
called
the
liberal
solution
carefully
put
in
the
background
and
tried
to
forget
it
will
militate
against
an
honest
solution
which
would
recognize
the
completely
distinct
character
of
the
jew
and
yet
refuse
to
subject
them
to
any
indignity
or
suffering
on
that
account
there
is
more
than
this
the
various
nations
taken
as
a
whole
the
roumanians
as
a
whole
the
poles
as
a
whole
the
french
the
italians
the
english
as
a
whole
take
up
very
different
attitudes
at
any
one
time
toward
israel
and
in
each
the
attitude
varies
from
generation
to
generation
there
is
always
at
any
one
time
of
history
including
our
own
time
a
certain
number
of
national
units
which
are
openly
hostile
to
the
jew
regretting
his
presence
among
them
restricting
his
activities
and
determined
above
all
to
separate
him
by
a
sharp
legal
definition
if
possible
at
any
rate
by
universal
social
practice
from
the
rest
of
the
community
now
these
hostile
peoples
can
not
possibly
be
prevented
from
using
the
weapon
put
into
their
hands
by
the
existence
of
a
new
zion
with
the
implications
i
have
just
defined
it
is
difficult
enough
even
now
for
the
countries
where
jewish
finance
controls
the
politicians
and
these
are
still
the
most
powerful
countries
to
restrain
the
feelings
in
the
lesser
nations
it
is
only
done
by
elaborate
rules
which
are
imperfectly
obeyed
and
which
are
felt
in
these
smaller
nations
to
be
imposed
by
alien
interference
with
their
domestic
rights
the
protection
by
the
french
english
and
american
governments
of
what
are
called
by
a
euphemism
national
minorities
which
means
of
course
everywhere
the
jews
is
a
perilous
affair
and
one
which
can
only
be
carried
out
most
imperfectly
even
as
it
is
but
the
one
foundation
for
that
task
the
one
argument
which
its
promoters
appeal
to
is
the
fact
that
the
national
minority
that
is
the
jews
present
in
a
hostile
community
can
plead
universal
exile
if
you
turn
them
out
in
order
to
suppress
them
they
can
only
leave
for
another
country
they
have
none
of
their
own
to
go
to
or
again
if
your
treatment
of
the
jews
is
harsher
than
that
of
your
neighbour
you
are
virtually
directing
a
jewish
emigration
over
your
neighbour
borders
and
to
that
your
neighbour
has
a
right
to
object
but
once
an
independent
jewish
seat
is
established
this
argument
falls
to
the
ground
it
is
no
reply
to
tell
these
nations
that
the
new
jewish
state
can
not
contain
the
whole
jewish
race
it
will
answer
that
it
is
not
concerned
with
the
whole
jewish
race
but
only
with
its
own
section
of
that
race
further
it
will
of
course
always
be
to
the
interest
of
those
who
desire
to
be
rid
of
the
jewish
element
in
their
midst
to
argue
that
the
jewish
state
could
be
more
peopled
and
that
there
is
plenty
of
room
for
more
citizens
again
those
hostile
to
the
jews
in
their
midst
can
say
very
well
since
there
is
no
room
for
the
whole
mass
of
our
jews
in
your
new
state
we
will
not
deal
with
the
whole
mass
allow
us
to
suggest
that
such
and
such
individuals
shall
leave
our
state
where
they
are
not
wanted
and
shall
go
to
their
own
and
they
would
pick
out
the
jews
whose
exile
would
most
weaken
the
jewish
community
in
their
midst
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
with
the
cabinets
of
rome
washington
london
and
paris
still
heavily
influenced
by
jewish
finance
they
have
for
the
moment
a
military
force
behind
them
sufficient
to
impose
their
orders
in
some
measure
upon
the
reluctant
nations
of
eastern
europe
and
in
some
measure
to
create
an
artificial
protection
for
the
jews
there
even
if
this
protection
were
to
last
another
generation
which
is
unlikely
the
presence
of
zionism
interpreted
in
the
sense
i
have
just
quoted
would
be
enough
to
undermine
its
work
on
any
change
in
the
situation
in
case
of
any
conflict
between
these
western
powers
or
of
any
change
by
one
or
more
of
them
in
its
attitude
towards
the
jews
zionism
thus
interpreted
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
jews
in
the
centre
and
east
of
europe
the
danger
is
of
such
great
practical
importance
that
it
ought
to
be
the
very
first
matter
for
discussion
it
is
only
our
acquired
habit
of
falsehood
and
secrecy
upon
the
jewish
problem
which
has
thrust
it
in
the
background
in
the
nature
of
things
it
must
come
to
the
front
and
it
would
be
far
better
to
have
the
lines
of
some
solution
laid
down
before
it
becomes
insistent
what
are
those
lines
to
be
their
general
character
is
clear
enough
whether
it
be
of
advantage
or
no
to
have
a
purely
jewish
state
i
mean
whether
it
be
of
advantage
to
israel
or
no
may
be
safely
left
to
the
jews
themselves
to
discuss
but
one
thing
is
certain
if
they
decide
in
favour
of
its
continuance
then
they
must
decide
also
in
favour
of
some
form
of
recognition
for
the
purely
jewish
nationality
of
the
jews
that
state
thus
only
will
the
situation
become
open
and
therefore
innocuous
if
they
try
under
the
new
conditions
to
maintain
the
old
fiction
that
a
jew
is
at
the
same
time
a
jew
and
yet
not
a
jew
that
he
can
be
at
the
same
time
a
jew
and
an
englishman
or
a
jew
and
a
russian
or
a
jew
and
an
italian
they
will
be
trying
to
maintain
it
under
conditions
quite
other
than
those
of
the
past
and
under
conditions
where
the
falsehood
will
break
down
in
practice
suppose
you
were
to
make
such
recognition
partly
voluntary
and
leave
it
to
the
jew
wherever
he
might
be
to
claim
or
not
to
claim
his
nationality
as
a
jew
to
be
regarded
if
he
so
willed
as
a
national
of
the
jewish
nation
in
zion
or
as
a
national
of
the
people
among
whom
he
happened
to
be
living
for
the
moment
you
may
say
that
under
this
purely
voluntary
system
which
would
i
suppose
be
more
just
very
few
would
choose
for
zion
the
great
majority
would
like
to
go
on
under
the
old
fiction
that
is
certainly
true
of
the
west
but
would
it
be
true
of
the
east
would
it
be
true
of
either
east
or
west
in
a
moment
of
persecution
i
think
it
would
not
even
if
it
be
true
of
the
east
it
certainly
would
not
be
true
of
any
body
of
jews
suffering
there
in
the
future
any
degree
of
molestation
but
apart
from
that
supposing
but
a
small
minority
availed
themselves
of
this
voluntary
form
of
recognition
supposing
only
a
small
minority
to
claim
jewish
nationality
as
defined
in
the
terms
of
the
zionist
state
there
would
still
be
the
contrast
between
those
who
had
thus
publicly
proclaimed
themselves
nationals
of
zion
and
those
who
hung
back
in
other
words
short
of
a
general
admitted
maintenance
of
the
old
fiction
of
which
zionism
more
than
any
other
force
must
accelerate
the
breakdown
you
must
have
through
zionism
an
accelerated
tendency
to
treating
jews
throughout
the
world
as
being
whether
without
the
new
zionist
state
or
within
it
a
separate
people
and
they
are
a
separate
people
they
can
not
be
other
my
whole
plea
is
that
this
truth
should
be
recognized
and
acted
upon
for
if
it
is
shirked
or
denied
it
will
take
its
revenge
reality
always
takes
its
revenge
upon
unreal
pretence
there
remains
in
connection
with
zionism
another
consideration
which
is
also
of
importance
though
of
a
very
different
kind
is
the
new
jewish
state
to
rely
upon
its
own
military
strength
and
its
own
police
though
perhaps
guaranteed
for
what
that
may
be
worth
by
international
agreement
or
is
it
to
be
a
protected
state
occupied
defended
and
policed
by
the
strength
and
fighting
qualities
of
some
other
kind
of
men
not
jews
englishmen
frenchmen
or
what
not
as
we
know
the
particular
solution
attempted
the
particular
zionism
of
which
the
experiment
is
now
being
made
in
palestine
plumps
for
the
solution
the
protection
of
jews
from
natives
is
to
be
undertaken
by
a
garrison
of
englishmen
it
plumps
for
this
solution
under
conditions
as
adverse
as
they
well
can
be
the
present
experiment
is
as
we
noted
at
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
not
an
independent
jewish
state
national
guaranteed
standing
in
its
own
strength
but
a
state
and
that
state
protected
by
one
nation
great
britain
the
new
zion
does
not
depend
for
its
internal
peace
for
its
establishment
against
highly
hostile
forces
for
the
of
the
local
landowners
for
the
keeping
of
the
peace
between
local
elements
highly
hostile
to
itself
upon
jewish
soldiers
and
jewish
courage
it
depends
upon
british
soldiers
british
organization
and
british
sacrifice
those
who
have
promoted
the
zionist
experiment
have
deliberately
chosen
the
very
worst
moment
for
such
a
folly
granted
that
whoever
was
to
be
the
protector
he
must
be
a
friendly
protector
no
worse
solution
could
have
been
devised
a
little
nation
is
always
morally
guaranteed
in
its
independence
if
only
by
the
balance
of
the
greater
nations
the
violation
of
the
neutrality
of
belgium
offers
nothing
of
a
rule
on
the
contrary
it
was
an
odious
exception
and
an
exception
it
would
have
been
just
as
much
if
the
neutrality
had
not
been
officially
guaranteed
under
prussia
own
hand
the
smaller
nations
of
which
the
modern
world
is
full
will
have
we
may
be
very
certain
a
long
lease
of
life
the
larger
nations
envy
but
applaud
their
security
and
happiness
they
will
not
be
allowed
to
disappear
the
same
i
think
would
be
true
of
the
jewish
national
seat
could
it
be
established
inhabited
wholly
or
mainly
by
men
of
the
jewish
race
religion
and
culture
presenting
to
the
world
the
same
aspect
as
does
for
instance
denmark
but
to
depend
for
its
establishment
upon
the
superior
power
upon
the
military
and
financial
sacrifice
of
another
and
totally
different
people
is
a
challenge
and
a
provocation
it
is
the
building
of
the
pyramid
upwards
from
its
apex
it
is
an
experiment
in
the
most
unstable
of
unstable
equilibriums
the
matter
is
of
course
being
discussed
everywhere
from
the
point
of
view
of
great
britain
and
nowhere
more
eagerly
than
among
those
who
have
to
do
the
policing
and
the
armed
protection
but
we
are
not
here
concerned
with
the
ill
effects
such
a
situation
must
have
on
great
britain
effects
so
ill
that
the
experiment
as
a
merely
british
protectorate
is
bound
to
break
down
we
are
rather
concerned
with
the
effect
it
may
have
upon
the
jews
themselves
no
great
nation
will
sacrifice
its
foreign
policy
will
admit
a
point
of
acute
weakness
simply
to
please
the
jews
sooner
or
later
such
a
nation
is
bound
to
say
can
not
sacrifice
our
interests
to
yours
look
after
yourselves
and
that
is
where
the
peril
to
the
jews
of
this
system
a
protectorate
comes
in
if
there
were
any
reason
to
suppose
a
natural
alliance
between
the
british
army
and
the
jews
if
we
could
imagine
british
officers
and
men
taking
a
natural
pleasure
in
ousting
the
arab
and
making
way
for
the
jew
it
would
be
another
matter
if
there
were
something
in
the
nature
of
things
which
made
that
alliance
permanent
and
stable
if
the
jews
were
a
fully
accepted
part
of
the
british
commonwealth
as
are
for
instance
the
scots
or
the
welsh
some
permanent
arrangement
might
be
possible
but
they
are
nothing
of
the
sort
the
position
is
wholly
unnatural
it
can
not
last
and
if
it
can
not
last
with
the
british
connection
how
should
it
last
with
any
other
how
shall
the
transition
be
made
from
a
british
protectorate
to
another
protectorate
or
how
seeing
what
violent
hatreds
have
already
been
roused
by
the
mere
beginnings
of
the
experiment
shall
the
conflict
which
makes
the
protectorate
necessary
be
avoided
so
far
the
dislike
of
the
position
which
is
very
and
already
very
deep
in
england
is
a
passive
dislike
no
english
soldier
has
yet
been
killed
there
has
been
but
little
necessity
as
yet
to
repress
the
arab
and
create
hostility
though
even
what
little
necessity
there
has
been
was
odious
to
the
troops
concerned
but
things
can
not
remain
in
that
state
the
conflict
is
inevitable
when
the
conflict
comes
the
feeling
which
has
hitherto
been
passive
will
become
active
people
will
not
tolerate
the
loss
of
sons
and
brothers
in
a
quarrel
which
is
none
of
theirs
which
can
not
possibly
strengthen
the
british
state
which
if
anything
must
weaken
it
which
is
felt
to
be
precarious
and
ephemeral
and
which
will
be
undertaken
against
those
with
whom
british
sympathy
naturally
lies
and
in
favour
of
those
with
whom
the
average
soldier
and
citizen
unlike
the
professional
politician
has
no
ties
and
no
sympathy
the
matter
can
be
very
plainly
put
thus
if
a
zionist
experiment
is
necessary
or
advisable
then
let
it
be
made
in
such
a
fashion
that
it
can
be
dependent
upon
jewish
police
and
a
jewish
army
alone
let
it
not
rely
upon
a
foreign
protectorate
which
will
not
last
long
which
is
a
weakness
to
the
directing
power
and
which
creates
a
false
position
if
it
be
answered
that
the
jews
are
not
capable
of
producing
such
an
army
or
such
a
police
that
they
would
inevitably
be
defeated
and
oppressed
by
the
hostile
and
more
warlike
majority
among
whom
they
would
find
themselves
then
let
them
make
the
experiment
elsewhere
but
it
is
certain
that
the
present
form
of
the
new
protectorate
is
the
most
perilous
form
which
could
have
been
chosen
for
it
so
far
as
the
jews
themselves
are
concerned
i
appeal
confidently
to
the
near
future
to
confirm
this
judgment
from
one
most
poignant
aspect
of
the
matter
which
we
all
have
in
mind
i
deliberately
abstain
i
mean
the
effect
of
the
experiment
upon
christian
and
mohammedan
feelings
throughout
the
world
of
an
attempt
to
establish
jewish
control
over
the
holy
places
i
abstain
because
of
the
emotions
aroused
by
it
which
are
violent
and
universal
and
are
of
the
sort
i
have
deliberately
determined
as
my
preface
has
informed
the
reader
to
keep
out
of
this
essay
things
indeed
are
not
yet
at
the
point
of
open
quarrel
in
this
most
perilous
of
all
the
results
of
zionism
we
must
trust
for
a
solution
before
it
is
too
late
but
that
solution
will
not
be
reached
if
we
select
for
discussion
matters
upon
which
there
can
be
no
agreement
and
on
which
there
is
now
aroused
the
most
passionate
feeling
still
though
i
abstain
from
discussing
that
point
i
would
beg
the
jewish
readers
of
this
my
book
to
bear
it
in
mind
if
they
believe
the
religious
emotions
to
be
dead
in
the
modern
world
or
even
to
be
lessening
they
may
find
themselves
terribly
disillusioned
i
also
refrain
from
making
comment
here
i
have
made
it
strongly
enough
elsewhere
upon
the
strange
selection
made
by
the
jews
for
their
first
ruler
of
the
arabs
and
christians
in
palestine
i
will
do
no
more
than
to
say
that
a
desire
to
shield
the
less
worthy
specimens
of
one
race
is
natural
and
even
praiseworthy
one
may
even
take
a
certain
glory
in
that
one
is
able
to
protect
them
from
outsiders
but
to
give
them
too
great
a
prominence
is
a
mistake
and
it
is
indeed
deplorable
that
of
the
whole
world
of
jews
from
crowds
of
jews
eminent
in
administration
and
political
science
known
for
their
upright
dealing
and
blameless
careers
balfour
jewish
advisers
whoever
they
were
should
have
pitched
on
the
author
of
the
marconi
contract
and
the
spokesman
of
the
famous
declaration
in
the
house
of
commons
that
no
politician
had
touched
marconi
shares
our
duty
chapter
xii
our
duty
the
solution
which
i
propose
which
i
believe
could
be
made
stable
and
which
i
further
believe
is
the
only
stable
one
demands
a
greater
a
more
necessary
effort
upon
our
side
than
upon
that
of
our
guests
it
is
the
average
man
who
must
do
his
duty
in
the
matter
and
it
is
upon
him
that
the
responsibility
will
fall
if
we
take
up
once
again
that
wretched
sequence
of
persecution
reaction
which
has
marked
so
many
centuries
we
are
the
vast
majority
we
are
the
organism
within
which
this
small
minority
moves
we
are
or
could
be
if
we
chose
the
makers
of
our
own
laws
and
we
are
certainly
the
makers
of
our
own
political
moods
i
know
it
is
the
custom
to
throw
all
the
responsibility
upon
the
other
side
to
be
perpetually
devising
instruments
for
their
guidance
which
soon
become
instruments
for
their
oppression
and
in
general
to
imagine
a
problem
wherein
the
part
of
the
european
is
purely
negative
and
all
the
work
has
to
be
done
by
the
jewish
stranger
that
attitude
is
not
only
false
but
grossly
undignified
when
men
accuse
some
one
weaker
than
themselves
of
interference
with
and
even
of
acquiring
power
over
them
they
condemn
themselves
it
is
in
the
main
our
fault
if
an
equilibrium
has
so
rarely
been
reached
in
all
these
sixty
generations
of
debate
for
however
alien
however
irritant
the
foreign
body
be
it
is
we
who
have
in
our
hands
the
solvent
of
that
irritant
and
of
relieving
the
strain
which
it
causes
here
let
me
recall
at
the
risk
of
repetition
for
repetition
is
necessary
to
lucidity
in
such
arguments
the
logical
process
with
which
i
opened
this
essay
i
say
that
the
vast
majority
the
fixed
race
through
which
in
fluid
and
nomadic
form
israel
goes
moving
from
century
to
century
is
not
free
to
discharge
its
responsibility
by
any
one
of
those
attempted
solutions
which
i
have
condemned
no
man
i
trust
will
have
the
cynicism
to
say
that
mere
persecution
let
alone
its
horrible
extreme
is
or
should
be
a
solution
no
man
can
predict
the
same
of
exile
either
no
man
can
discharge
our
responsibility
by
pretending
that
any
solution
arrived
at
must
be
for
our
good
alone
and
may
disregard
that
of
those
who
live
among
us
it
is
a
statement
one
hears
frequently
enough
that
the
masters
of
house
have
alone
to
decide
what
shall
be
done
under
their
roof
that
the
interloper
the
alien
element
has
no
standing
and
no
right
to
complain
of
whatever
measures
may
be
taken
for
the
protection
of
the
household
the
thing
so
put
sounds
plausible
it
is
essentially
false
it
is
comparable
to
the
argument
applied
to
private
property
that
because
private
property
is
a
right
and
that
because
a
man
may
do
what
he
likes
with
his
own
therefore
he
may
use
it
to
the
manifest
hurt
of
others
moreover
the
analogy
is
false
for
when
a
man
is
talking
of
the
master
of
the
house
having
the
right
in
his
household
to
decide
its
own
way
of
living
and
of
treating
its
guests
he
is
considering
a
very
small
unit
in
a
great
community
his
household
in
the
whole
nation
a
little
body
which
if
it
discharge
or
in
any
other
way
deal
with
something
alien
to
itself
will
inflict
no
great
injury
upon
that
foreign
body
since
there
is
all
the
world
for
it
to
turn
to
outside
but
in
the
relations
between
the
jew
and
christendom
or
the
jew
and
islam
the
parallel
fails
it
is
precisely
because
there
is
no
outside
to
which
the
exile
can
turn
that
a
duty
is
imposed
on
us
it
is
true
indeed
that
when
a
small
and
alien
minority
assumes
to
dictate
the
policy
of
the
rest
to
regard
its
own
advantages
alone
and
subordinate
to
those
advantages
the
life
of
all
the
claim
is
grotesque
and
must
be
disallowed
but
we
should
remember
upon
the
other
side
that
it
is
only
by
exaggerating
its
claim
that
a
minority
can
live
at
all
it
is
only
by
fierce
insistence
upon
its
right
to
survive
that
its
survival
is
guaranteed
we
can
arrive
at
justice
in
this
matter
by
the
process
of
putting
ourselves
in
the
shoes
of
those
in
relation
to
whom
we
propose
to
act
put
yourself
in
the
shoes
of
the
jew
and
ask
how
this
doctrine
of
doing
what
one
likes
with
one
own
and
being
the
master
of
one
own
household
would
look
to
you
a
public
example
which
very
rightly
made
a
stir
a
few
months
before
this
book
was
published
may
serve
as
text
a
learned
and
distinguished
jew
oscar
levy
a
man
who
was
an
asset
to
any
community
was
turned
out
of
the
country
under
circumstances
which
many
of
my
readers
will
recall
he
pleaded
with
perfect
justice
that
as
a
jew
such
an
exile
left
him
homeless
that
the
original
country
of
which
he
was
nominally
a
citizen
under
the
fiction
that
jews
can
be
germans
or
austrians
or
what
not
and
cease
to
be
themselves
would
not
have
him
that
his
interests
his
livelihood
had
attached
him
to
this
country
he
had
never
hidden
his
true
nationality
nor
changed
his
name
nor
used
any
of
those
subterfuges
which
even
when
excusable
are
dangerous
and
contemptible
in
so
many
of
his
compatriots
there
was
no
conceivable
reason
why
such
rigour
should
be
used
against
this
man
save
indeed
that
he
was
a
jew
put
yourself
in
his
shoes
and
see
how
the
thing
looks
there
is
no
nation
to
which
you
could
have
returned
there
is
no
society
to
receive
you
as
a
member
of
it
you
are
not
permitted
to
remain
in
the
atmosphere
with
which
you
have
grown
familiar
in
the
surroundings
which
have
become
those
of
your
later
life
and
your
consonance
with
which
it
is
too
late
for
you
to
change
could
there
be
a
grosser
cruelty
or
a
grosser
injustice
it
is
the
very
core
of
the
whole
problem
that
the
jew
must
be
harboured
and
therefore
to
some
one
of
us
the
question
must
be
put
will
you
harbour
him
and
if
so
upon
what
terms
if
each
man
answer
no
i
will
not
then
all
collectively
become
oppressors
it
is
no
answer
to
say
these
men
are
not
of
us
and
therefore
they
may
conspire
against
us
or
their
interests
are
divergent
from
ours
and
therefore
may
and
do
clash
with
ours
all
that
is
granted
that
is
merely
stating
the
problem
not
solving
it
what
do
we
say
in
daily
life
of
men
who
merely
state
their
grievances
harp
upon
them
and
make
no
effort
to
put
them
right
what
do
we
think
of
men
who
perpetually
complain
of
something
naturally
weaker
than
themselves
make
no
effort
to
understand
its
necessities
and
attempt
only
to
rid
themselves
of
the
nuisance
without
considering
reciprocal
duty
and
mutual
relations
the
same
should
we
think
of
those
who
so
act
towards
the
jewish
community
in
our
midst
which
for
all
its
domination
and
exaggerated
modern
power
is
ultimately
at
our
mercy
far
weaker
than
we
are
in
numbers
and
situation
without
further
elaboration
of
what
should
be
an
obvious
political
and
moral
principle
let
us
consider
our
part
in
the
task
it
consists
i
conceive
in
two
very
different
determinations
two
very
different
but
allied
lines
of
conduct
to
which
we
must
pledge
ourselves
the
first
until
recently
the
most
difficult
is
the
determination
to
speak
of
the
jewish
people
as
openly
as
continuously
with
as
much
interest
with
as
close
an
examination
as
we
speak
of
any
other
foreign
body
with
which
we
are
brought
in
contact
the
second
which
will
perhaps
be
the
more
difficult
duty
to
practise
in
the
future
will
be
to
avoid
in
the
individual
public
recognition
of
those
with
whom
we
must
live
all
futile
anger
and
all
mere
reaction
i
mean
by
mere
reaction
blind
reaction
the
instinctive
thrusting
back
against
a
thing
which
presses
on
us
the
uncalculated
and
animal
return
blow
the
consequences
of
which
either
to
ourselves
or
to
others
are
not
weighed
when
it
is
delivered
the
futile
complaint
the
futile
rage
the
futile
cruelty
unless
those
two
duties
are
undertaken
together
unless
the
determination
to
practise
both
be
of
equal
weight
the
solution
i
propose
will
fail
to
discuss
the
problem
presented
by
the
presence
of
the
jewish
people
to
talk
of
them
as
one
would
of
any
other
openly
and
frankly
to
interest
oneself
in
their
history
and
in
their
present
doings
all
this
is
only
to
aggravate
the
trouble
if
we
use
that
open
dealing
for
the
purpose
of
doing
them
a
hurt
or
if
in
the
course
of
it
we
allow
ourselves
merely
from
irritation
or
contrast
from
the
sense
which
all
must
have
of
opposition
to
things
alien
to
react
against
them
without
consideration
of
the
immediate
and
ultimate
consequences
not
only
to
themselves
but
to
us
conversely
the
determination
to
regard
their
interests
and
to
avoid
every
possible
occasion
of
conflict
to
hold
a
just
measure
with
them
is
quite
useless
if
we
falsify
the
whole
relation
by
secrecy
and
false
convention
the
moment
that
comes
in
there
comes
in
with
it
a
secret
dissatisfaction
with
oneself
and
with
the
whole
situation
the
position
is
falsified
the
seed
of
animosity
greatly
stimulated
the
danger
of
mutual
contempt
made
inevitable
now
let
us
look
at
these
two
branches
of
what
we
have
to
do
in
the
matter
and
see
what
difficulties
lie
in
the
way
in
the
way
of
frankly
recognizing
examining
taking
an
open
interest
in
the
jewish
minority
in
our
midst
there
lie
three
very
powerful
obstacles
first
the
inherited
convention
of
polite
society
secondly
and
much
the
most
powerful
fear
and
thirdly
the
very
reputable
desire
to
avoid
offence
the
first
of
these
the
fear
of
convention
has
many
roots
the
necessity
for
harmony
in
a
leisured
life
that
is
the
desire
to
avoid
friction
even
at
the
expense
of
truth
the
mere
momentum
of
a
quiet
habit
the
fear
of
misunderstanding
which
may
come
from
one
side
casting
ridicule
upon
the
other
which
may
offend
the
person
whom
we
have
misunderstood
or
make
us
ridiculous
in
his
eyes
and
those
of
our
audience
there
is
also
of
course
as
a
cause
more
powerful
than
any
other
the
force
which
lies
behind
all
convention
the
force
which
makes
a
man
take
off
his
hat
in
a
church
which
forbids
his
walking
without
boots
in
the
street
on
the
driest
day
that
is
the
pressure
of
general
practice
but
the
thing
to
realize
is
that
in
this
form
i
mean
as
distinct
from
any
feeling
of
fear
or
of
charity
the
thing
is
a
convention
and
a
convention
only
difficult
as
it
is
to
break
with
conventions
unless
convention
is
broken
once
and
for
all
the
jewish
problem
remains
with
us
unsolved
and
growing
in
acuteness
and
peril
you
can
meet
an
irishman
and
discuss
with
him
the
conditions
of
his
nation
you
can
ask
an
italian
when
he
was
last
in
italy
or
congratulate
a
frenchman
upon
his
acquisition
of
your
tongue
or
tell
him
that
it
is
difficult
for
him
to
understand
your
own
customs
but
a
convention
arose
under
the
liberal
fiction
to
which
i
have
devoted
so
much
space
in
the
earlier
part
of
this
book
that
to
do
any
of
these
very
natural
things
in
the
case
of
a
jew
is
monstrous
your
audience
is
shocked
if
you
ask
some
learned
jew
at
a
public
table
a
question
upon
his
national
literature
or
history
it
is
a
solecism
to
refer
to
his
nationality
at
all
save
perhaps
now
and
then
in
terms
of
foolish
praise
in
nine
times
out
of
ten
praise
not
to
the
point
and
not
desired
by
its
recipient
and
even
praise
must
be
approached
most
gingerly
you
may
not
ask
a
jew
in
london
however
keen
your
desire
for
information
whether
he
had
cousins
in
lithuania
or
galicia
who
have
told
him
of
the
conditions
of
those
distressed
countries
you
may
not
ask
him
when
his
family
came
to
england
nor
if
he
be
a
recent
arrival
what
he
thinks
of
the
country
the
whole
thing
is
more
than
this
you
must
you
are
expected
or
were
until
quite
recently
expected
to
emphasize
in
a
most
extravagant
manner
the
complete
identity
of
your
jewish
guest
with
the
people
among
whom
he
lives
i
do
not
take
offence
if
some
chance
acquaintance
noting
my
french
name
talks
to
me
about
france
and
is
interested
in
my
experience
as
a
conscript
long
ago
in
that
country
redmond
did
not
feel
himself
insulted
when
those
he
met
in
london
discussed
irish
matters
with
him
from
the
most
acute
difficulty
in
politics
to
the
most
general
allusion
to
the
abbey
theatre
the
editor
of
an
italian
review
visiting
england
is
not
shocked
if
you
ask
him
when
he
left
florence
nor
are
those
around
you
horrified
at
the
of
your
question
but
in
the
matter
of
the
jew
there
stands
this
convention
cutting
you
off
from
any
such
straightforward
and
simple
way
of
dealing
with
a
that
convention
i
say
must
be
broken
down
if
we
are
to
get
any
results
at
all
and
to
establish
a
permanent
peace
the
thing
was
not
of
course
entirely
irrational
in
origin
no
custom
is
it
was
to
be
excused
upon
several
grounds
first
there
was
the
fact
that
many
people
were
known
to
cherish
so
strong
an
hostility
to
jews
that
to
emphasize
the
jewish
character
of
anyone
present
might
awaken
that
hostility
then
there
was
the
peculiar
rapid
transition
both
of
jewish
movements
and
of
jewish
fortunes
in
the
case
i
have
suggested
of
asking
a
london
jew
whether
he
had
relatives
in
galicia
or
lithuania
you
might
be
stumbling
upon
relations
much
poorer
than
himself
in
the
east
end
of
london
or
again
you
might
seem
to
be
emphasizing
the
nomadic
character
of
the
race
and
thereby
also
emphasizing
the
contrast
between
it
and
our
own
but
much
the
strongest
excuse
for
the
convention
was
the
idea
that
its
exercise
pleased
the
jews
themselves
men
avoided
direct
mention
of
jewish
nationality
because
it
was
felt
that
such
direct
mention
was
almost
an
insult
it
was
a
thing
which
the
jew
in
whose
presence
you
found
yourself
desired
to
have
kept
in
the
background
and
though
we
might
not
understand
why
he
desired
it
yet
we
respected
his
desire
as
we
do
that
of
anyone
with
whom
we
wish
to
preserve
harmonious
relations
most
men
for
instance
are
indifferent
upon
say
the
matter
of
smoking
most
men
are
quite
at
their
ease
when
they
are
asked
whether
they
smoke
or
not
and
if
they
do
whether
they
prefer
this
or
that
brand
of
tobacco
but
now
and
then
one
comes
across
a
man
who
from
some
accident
of
training
as
for
instance
a
man
whose
mother
brought
him
up
to
think
smoking
a
mortal
sin
does
not
like
to
have
it
alluded
to
i
myself
know
the
case
of
a
man
of
the
highest
culture
and
of
considerable
social
position
to
whom
you
may
not
say
anything
about
pigs
either
in
connection
with
farming
or
in
connection
with
food
for
his
sympathies
are
mohammedan
in
these
exceptional
cases
when
we
know
of
our
guest
particular
desire
we
yield
to
it
for
the
sake
of
harmony
and
of
right
living
so
is
it
in
this
matter
of
the
former
convention
against
alluding
to
jewish
nationality
or
jewish
interests
in
any
form
whether
the
jews
were
wise
or
not
to
cherish
that
convention
as
they
undoubtedly
did
does
not
concern
this
part
of
my
argument
i
am
talking
of
our
duty
and
not
of
theirs
but
i
say
that
unless
the
convention
is
softened
and
at
last
dissolved
nothing
can
be
done
both
parties
should
know
that
it
only
does
harm
it
renders
stilted
and
absurd
all
our
relations
it
fosters
that
suspicion
of
secrecy
which
i
have
insisted
upon
as
the
chief
irritant
in
those
relations
and
it
creates
a
feeling
of
exception
of
oddity
which
is
the
very
worst
service
that
could
be
rendered
to
the
jews
themselves
some
little
time
ago
the
convention
went
so
far
that
even
a
mention
a
neutral
nay
a
laudatory
mention
of
anything
jewish
in
a
general
company
led
to
an
immediate
awkwardness
men
looked
over
their
shoulders
women
gave
downward
glances
right
and
left
a
sort
of
hunt
began
to
see
whether
anyone
present
could
possibly
in
any
remote
connection
be
offended
by
the
monstrous
deed
if
a
man
said
what
a
poet
heine
was
and
how
thoroughly
jewish
is
his
irony
and
said
it
in
a
room
full
of
people
the
adjective
jewish
acted
like
a
pistol
shot
could
anything
be
more
absurd
yet
so
it
was
but
the
point
i
make
is
not
against
the
absurdity
of
this
convention
but
against
its
peril
it
is
an
obstacle
to
all
right
handling
of
what
is
becoming
daily
a
more
and
more
insistent
and
acute
difficulty
it
is
obvious
that
the
getting
rid
of
such
a
convention
is
not
to
be
effected
by
violent
methods
nor
immediately
but
our
duty
is
to
accelerate
its
decline
and
within
reason
to
enlarge
every
opportunity
for
treating
the
jewish
nationality
precisely
as
one
treats
any
other
i
mean
precisely
as
one
treats
any
other
in
conversation
or
in
writing
we
all
know
the
insane
type
which
loves
to
break
convention
merely
because
it
is
a
convention
and
we
shall
certainly
have
to
be
on
our
guard
against
this
sort
of
person
in
the
near
future
as
this
particular
convention
begins
to
break
down
but
without
encouraging
such
eccentricities
there
is
ample
room
for
an
increasing
ease
in
the
recognition
of
what
after
all
we
know
to
be
reality
a
reality
which
requires
open
discussion
for
the
good
of
us
all
the
danger
is
lest
even
this
merely
conventional
obstacle
should
by
too
long
a
resistance
dam
up
forces
which
tend
to
break
it
down
and
therefore
lest
when
it
is
pulled
down
we
should
admit
the
other
extreme
of
licence
with
its
opportunity
for
insult
and
damage
that
is
what
has
happened
in
the
case
of
other
much
more
reasonable
victorian
conventions
and
we
must
not
have
it
happen
in
the
case
of
the
convention
which
for
so
long
forbade
us
to
admit
that
a
jew
was
a
jew
or
to
take
any
open
interest
when
he
was
present
in
the
things
which
he
himself
thinks
the
most
interesting
of
all
and
if
anyone
shall
answer
that
convention
is
necessary
lest
on
its
decline
open
hostility
should
follow
i
can
only
say
that
this
is
to
despair
of
any
equitable
solution
at
all
but
my
whole
thesis
in
this
book
is
that
such
a
solution
need
not
yet
be
despaired
of
there
is
one
more
thing
to
be
said
in
this
matter
of
the
old
however
long
it
may
linger
in
the
small
educated
class
it
has
gone
for
ever
among
the
populace
and
it
is
the
popular
instinct
we
shall
have
mainly
to
deal
with
in
the
difficult
times
ahead
of
us
the
populace
in
this
country
talks
upon
jewish
matters
with
a
frankness
which
would
astonish
the
and
has
so
talked
upon
them
for
a
generation
past
ever
since
the
great
novel
influx
of
poor
jews
began
to
pour
into
our
towns
it
not
only
talks
thus
openly
to
and
of
jews
upon
its
own
level
but
it
is
thoroughly
alive
to
the
presence
and
power
of
jews
in
government
those
who
think
that
a
continuance
of
the
convention
can
put
off
the
necessity
for
a
solution
would
be
disillusioned
if
they
would
spend
a
few
days
east
of
aldgate
and
mix
with
their
there
allied
to
this
obstacle
of
convention
is
the
very
real
obstacle
of
charity
now
we
are
here
dealing
not
with
a
positive
charity
but
with
a
negative
one
and
with
a
form
of
charity
uncommonly
like
slackness
the
man
who
honestly
thinks
that
any
allusion
to
jewish
races
in
contemporary
art
history
or
letters
in
the
presence
of
a
jew
is
offensive
and
therefore
to
be
avoided
from
goodness
of
heart
who
also
practises
the
same
virtue
where
any
other
foreigner
is
is
rare
indeed
there
are
such
men
for
men
of
exceptional
goodness
coupled
with
exceptional
stupidity
are
to
be
found
but
the
excuse
of
charity
as
it
is
generally
put
forward
is
not
wholly
ingenuous
where
it
is
ingenuous
our
reply
must
be
that
even
at
the
risk
of
occasional
the
danger
of
offence
must
be
risked
for
unless
we
risk
it
there
is
increasing
peril
of
a
much
greater
offence
against
justice
for
whatever
reason
open
discussion
is
burked
even
for
the
reason
of
charity
we
only
put
off
the
evil
day
and
charity
so
used
may
be
compared
to
the
charity
which
refuses
to
take
action
in
any
other
critical
problem
of
increasing
gravity
the
charity
which
hesitates
to
control
the
supplies
of
a
spendthrift
or
to
wage
a
defensive
war
in
a
just
cause
or
to
defend
an
oppressed
man
at
the
risk
of
quarrelling
with
his
oppressor
is
a
charity
misdirected
but
as
i
have
said
with
much
the
greater
part
of
men
who
plead
this
motive
the
plea
is
if
they
would
only
examine
their
own
consciences
found
to
be
false
and
the
test
of
its
falsity
will
be
apparent
when
the
convention
slackens
when
it
is
no
longer
conventional
to
avoid
all
mention
of
jews
how
many
will
remain
silent
merely
from
the
love
of
their
one
might
go
further
and
say
that
when
the
convention
has
gone
any
need
for
this
kind
of
charity
will
go
with
it
there
is
an
exception
of
course
in
the
case
of
the
man
whose
dislike
of
jews
is
so
violent
that
he
fears
himself
if
he
gives
any
rein
to
his
tongue
that
mania
is
exceptional
but
where
it
is
found
certainly
its
victim
will
do
well
to
keep
silence
if
a
man
can
not
mention
the
hebrew
alphabet
without
a
sneer
or
the
economics
of
ricardo
without
betraying
his
ill
feeling
for
ricardo
lineage
then
certainly
he
had
better
hold
his
tongue
when
jews
are
there
so
too
a
frenchman
who
raves
against
the
english
had
far
better
not
discuss
the
british
constitution
or
the
genius
of
newton
in
any
society
where
an
englishman
may
be
present
there
remains
the
chief
obstacle
that
of
fear
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
strongest
force
still
restraining
an
expression
of
hostility
to
the
jew
is
fear
in
a
sense
of
course
there
is
a
fear
of
breaking
convention
but
that
is
fear
only
in
metaphor
i
mean
not
this
but
the
very
real
dread
of
consequences
the
feeling
that
an
expression
of
hostility
to
jewish
power
may
bring
definite
evils
on
the
individual
guilty
of
it
and
a
panic
lest
those
evils
should
fall
upon
him
how
strong
this
feeling
is
anyone
can
testify
who
has
explored
as
i
have
this
most
insistent
of
modern
political
ills
and
doubtless
the
greater
part
of
my
readers
will
recall
examples
to
the
point
it
is
a
fear
of
two
consequences
social
and
economic
and
even
of
both
combined
men
dread
lest
hostility
to
the
jew
domination
should
bring
them
into
the
grip
of
some
unknown
but
suspected
power
some
would
call
it
a
conspiracy
which
can
destroy
the
individual
who
shall
be
so
rash
as
to
challenge
it
some
perhaps
have
gone
to
the
length
the
insane
length
of
reading
the
word
destroy
in
its
literal
sense
and
of
fearing
for
their
lives
such
an
illusion
is
laughable
but
very
many
more
are
affected
by
the
reasonable
conception
that
they
will
have
against
them
if
they
provoke
it
an
intelligent
combined
action
which
they
can
not
meet
because
there
is
no
organization
upon
their
side
because
it
is
international
because
there
is
behind
it
a
great
intensity
of
feeling
because
through
finance
it
controls
the
political
machines
of
all
the
nations
because
it
is
in
the
press
and
so
forth
they
dread
i
say
the
social
consequences
they
also
and
that
with
more
definition
and
more
sense
dread
the
economic
consequences
they
recognize
they
also
exaggerate
the
grip
of
the
jew
over
finance
they
conceive
that
if
they
speak
they
will
be
dragged
down
their
enterprises
ruined
their
credit
dissolved
and
that
is
the
most
powerful
instrument
which
can
be
brought
to
bear
when
supernatural
motives
disappear
the
strongest
motive
remaining
after
appetite
is
avarice
and
avarice
is
more
universal
than
appetite
and
more
continuous
nor
is
it
only
avarice
which
is
at
work
here
but
also
the
respectable
desire
for
security
there
are
innumerable
men
who
would
express
publicly
on
jews
what
they
continually
express
in
private
but
who
conceal
their
feelings
for
fear
that
their
salaries
may
be
lost
or
their
modest
enterprises
wrecked
their
investments
lowered
and
their
position
ruined
above
them
are
a
lesser
number
equally
convinced
that
their
large
fortunes
would
be
in
peril
were
they
so
to
act
the
characteristic
of
all
this
feeling
is
in
the
first
place
as
would
seem
to
be
the
case
with
convention
though
in
a
much
greater
degree
it
dams
up
and
enormously
increases
the
latent
force
of
anger
against
jewish
power
both
real
and
imaginary
it
is
like
the
piling
up
of
a
head
of
water
when
a
river
valley
is
obstructed
or
like
the
introducing
of
resistance
into
an
electric
current
the
suppression
of
resentment
though
that
suppression
is
the
act
of
the
men
who
themselves
feel
the
resentment
and
not
directly
of
their
opponents
is
a
fierce
irritant
and
accounts
for
the
high
pressure
at
which
attack
escapes
when
once
it
is
loosened
i
speak
only
of
hostility
and
of
attack
for
it
is
in
these
least
rational
examples
that
the
strength
of
the
thing
is
to
be
found
but
it
applies
also
to
mere
discussion
there
is
hardly
anyone
who
does
not
desire
to
discuss
as
an
urgent
political
problem
the
present
position
the
present
power
the
present
disabilities
the
present
claims
of
israel
but
for
one
that
will
openly
discuss
these
things
there
are
ten
who
in
varying
degrees
forbid
themselves
so
plain
a
freedom
of
speech
in
dread
of
what
consequences
might
follow
it
has
like
all
panic
a
ridiculous
element
it
is
informed
by
the
most
absurd
illusions
it
suffers
from
grotesque
imaginings
and
phantasms
in
some
this
dread
of
the
jewish
power
has
very
plainly
passed
the
line
which
divides
the
stable
from
the
unstable
mind
and
even
the
sane
from
the
insane
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
formidable
element
in
our
problem
this
obstacle
much
more
than
that
of
convention
bears
a
character
of
rigidity
it
works
for
a
certain
time
then
it
breaks
down
and
releases
a
flood
that
is
why
the
first
expressions
of
hostility
in
our
time
were
so
exaggerated
and
that
is
why
so
many
of
them
were
plainly
mad
this
very
character
of
exaggeration
this
very
wildness
in
proportion
rendered
those
against
whom
the
attack
was
delivered
more
contemptuous
of
it
than
they
should
have
been
the
forerunners
of
the
present
movement
i
mean
of
the
movement
hostile
to
israel
were
not
calculated
to
excite
the
respect
of
their
opponent
or
even
to
carry
with
them
the
men
on
their
own
side
they
lacked
that
common
sense
which
is
the
first
quality
of
leadership
for
the
power
of
leadership
implies
a
soul
in
common
with
those
who
are
led
the
enthusiast
can
lead
permanently
but
the
extravagant
man
never
for
long
i
say
that
these
first
attacks
were
on
that
account
despised
they
were
unduly
despised
by
those
whom
they
menaced
there
lay
in
reserve
behind
all
the
exaggeration
and
wildness
a
great
bulk
of
very
different
opinion
the
opinion
of
men
normal
in
their
appreciation
of
values
and
of
proportion
not
given
to
seeing
things
fully
in
touch
with
reality
men
who
know
that
they
have
hitherto
only
been
silent
through
the
action
of
fear
who
despise
themselves
on
that
account
and
who
are
the
more
ready
to
act
for
the
sense
of
fear
not
only
degrades
but
angers
at
least
in
our
race
the
european
who
admits
to
himself
that
he
has
restrained
an
instinct
not
from
religion
nor
from
a
general
sense
of
right
but
from
cowardice
is
always
angry
with
himself
and
awaits
the
moment
when
he
can
take
his
own
revenge
upon
his
own
past
and
clear
himself
of
reproach
in
his
own
eyes
herein
lies
the
peril
to
israel
of
such
a
state
of
affairs
but
with
that
i
am
not
here
concerned
i
am
only
concerned
with
its
effect
upon
ourselves
so
long
as
we
degrade
ourselves
so
long
as
we
humiliate
ourselves
by
our
own
cowardice
so
long
as
we
shirk
all
reasonable
discussion
let
alone
all
expression
of
hostility
because
we
dread
the
consequences
at
the
hands
of
our
opponents
so
long
there
are
present
in
rising
intensity
two
evil
things
first
the
postponement
of
the
right
solution
secondly
the
turning
of
a
reasoned
policy
into
mere
hatred
with
all
the
consequences
that
flow
from
such
evil
emotion
the
longer
we
maintain
whatever
remains
of
that
barrier
to
free
speech
happily
it
is
already
crumbling
the
longer
do
we
produce
the
two
fatal
results
of
postponing
justice
and
of
creating
enmity
the
destruction
of
that
barrier
the
ridding
of
ourselves
of
fear
in
the
matter
is
as
is
always
the
case
in
the
exercising
of
this
unmanly
thing
a
matter
for
individual
effort
as
the
proverb
goes
some
one
must
bell
the
cat
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
if
each
man
waits
upon
his
neighbour
things
will
only
grow
worse
and
worse
it
is
for
each
in
his
place
before
it
is
too
late
to
approach
the
jewish
problem
and
to
discuss
it
openly
to
preface
that
discussion
by
a
frank
interest
and
a
general
expression
upon
all
those
things
in
the
minority
which
directly
concern
its
relations
with
the
majority
to
deal
with
the
jewish
nation
exactly
as
one
would
with
any
other
it
used
to
be
a
dictum
in
those
who
pleaded
a
lifetime
ago
for
the
open
criticism
of
scripture
that
the
bible
should
be
approached
like
any
other
book
the
result
is
not
of
good
augury
to
my
present
argument
and
i
rather
dread
the
parallel
but
since
the
phrase
is
well
known
i
will
use
it
as
a
model
it
is
time
i
say
to
be
rid
of
treating
the
jewish
nation
as
something
closed
mysterious
and
secret
let
us
treat
it
like
any
other
nation
it
is
no
wonder
if
men
moved
by
nothing
but
a
blind
hatred
feel
some
hesitation
upon
the
consequence
of
that
hatred
but
i
am
convinced
that
if
we
on
our
side
get
rid
of
this
absurd
modern
fear
take
the
jew
in
his
right
proportions
rid
our
mind
of
exaggeration
in
his
regard
especially
of
the
conception
of
some
inhuman
ability
capable
of
conducting
a
plot
of
diabolical
ingenuity
and
magnitude
we
shall
be
met
from
the
other
side
the
jews
are
not
the
only
force
which
is
international
nor
the
only
international
force
the
dread
of
which
has
disturbed
men
judgments
they
are
not
the
only
international
force
which
has
some
degree
of
organization
and
cohesion
if
you
desire
to
vent
your
active
dislike
of
the
scotch
or
of
the
irish
you
must
be
prepared
for
a
certain
amount
of
scotch
or
irish
hostility
you
will
come
across
something
of
an
organization
and
suffer
accordingly
but
if
you
cherish
the
conception
of
a
vast
subterranean
force
scotch
or
irish
watching
you
with
a
malignant
power
and
capable
of
your
destruction
you
are
i
think
out
of
the
real
world
if
you
desire
to
vent
your
active
dislike
of
the
catholic
church
you
will
find
ubiquitous
opposition
but
if
you
conclude
from
this
that
you
are
at
grips
with
a
monster
then
you
are
out
of
touch
with
reality
so
it
is
surely
with
this
dread
of
the
jewish
power
which
has
sullied
so
many
men
minds
postponed
the
right
discussion
of
the
problem
and
nourished
everywhere
if
we
simply
act
as
though
that
dread
were
despicable
like
any
other
dread
and
turned
to
perfectly
open
discussion
of
the
whole
affair
even
to
an
open
expression
of
hostility
where
hostility
is
deserved
we
shall
be
the
better
for
it
in
any
case
it
is
our
duty
to
ourselves
as
well
as
to
the
state
to
get
rid
of
fear
in
the
business
for
until
we
are
rid
of
it
no
advance
towards
a
solution
can
be
made
footnote
i
beg
leave
to
introduce
an
anecdote
an
undergraduate
once
said
to
jowett
the
master
of
balliol
i
take
up
the
gospels
and
treat
them
as
an
ordinary
book
the
master
answered
did
you
not
find
them
a
very
extraordinary
book
so
it
will
prove
i
think
with
the
fascination
of
israel
their
duty
chapter
xiii
their
duty
where
positive
causes
have
been
found
for
an
evil
it
is
obvious
that
the
cure
of
that
evil
consists
in
the
removal
of
the
causes
in
so
far
as
they
can
be
removed
in
the
particular
case
of
the
friction
between
the
jewish
community
and
their
hosts
the
causes
of
that
friction
are
the
foolish
and
dangerous
habit
of
secrecy
and
the
irritating
expression
of
superiority
the
causes
the
jew
can
remove
if
he
will
the
matter
is
in
his
own
hands
we
can
do
nothing
he
can
do
everything
but
beyond
this
negative
duty
which
is
incumbent
upon
the
jews
if
they
would
achieve
a
peaceful
issue
of
the
perils
which
menace
their
future
there
is
a
positive
action
also
incumbent
upon
them
they
must
foster
they
must
even
propose
institutions
which
will
the
better
mark
them
off
from
a
society
not
their
own
and
restore
to
them
the
dignity
of
a
nation
i
shall
in
the
last
chapter
of
this
book
contend
that
the
policy
leading
to
a
solution
must
repose
not
upon
direct
laws
of
our
own
imagining
not
upon
reactions
which
will
almost
certainly
prove
oppressive
and
almost
certainly
be
evaded
but
upon
a
general
spirit
recognizing
the
separate
nationality
of
the
jews
but
though
this
is
true
of
every
christian
western
state
in
which
they
find
themselves
it
is
not
true
of
their
own
nation
they
on
their
side
may
well
come
forward
with
propositions
which
they
have
the
capacity
for
making
because
they
will
know
how
to
frame
them
as
we
can
not
after
a
fashion
consistent
with
their
own
dignity
and
their
own
tradition
there
is
a
beginning
of
such
things
already
present
in
the
jewish
schools
the
jewish
guardians
and
the
considerable
separate
organization
which
the
jews
have
openly
set
up
for
their
community
in
this
country
these
beginnings
have
but
to
be
extended
those
who
are
openly
hostile
to
jews
will
say
that
any
proposals
coming
from
their
side
will
conceal
a
trap
this
people
they
say
will
always
suggest
things
which
will
seem
innocent
enough
and
apparently
do
no
more
than
define
their
position
plainly
for
the
future
but
we
shall
find
ourselves
caught
in
an
obligation
and
the
jews
more
our
masters
than
ever
they
will
say
these
objectors
remain
as
they
are
and
while
they
claim
every
privilege
as
a
separate
community
they
will
also
insist
upon
the
full
citizenship
which
is
incompatible
with
this
attitude
we
shall
find
that
whatever
institutions
we
ask
them
to
frame
those
institutions
will
work
not
only
in
their
favour
but
also
heavily
against
us
i
doubt
it
the
special
jewish
institutions
already
at
work
have
no
such
effect
on
the
contrary
they
already
relieve
the
strain
one
of
those
institutions
for
instance
is
the
jewish
press
the
newspapers
specially
devoted
to
jewish
interests
and
acting
as
spokesmen
for
jewish
ideas
they
are
not
always
as
polite
as
they
might
be
i
have
had
myself
at
times
to
lodge
a
complaint
against
the
way
in
which
they
have
treated
sincere
efforts
for
the
settlement
of
our
difficulties
and
an
honest
attempt
at
finding
a
way
out
they
have
left
a
handle
to
their
enemies
sometimes
by
too
insistent
or
as
those
enemies
would
call
it
too
arrogant
a
claim
and
they
do
write
now
and
then
as
though
we
the
vast
majority
had
no
rights
and
the
only
thing
worth
considering
was
the
advancement
of
their
own
people
but
after
all
it
would
be
absurd
to
expect
anything
else
a
small
minority
vigorously
fighting
its
own
hand
must
exaggerate
its
claim
an
organism
defending
itself
against
very
heavy
pressure
from
without
can
not
but
appear
aggressive
and
i
shall
always
maintain
that
the
presence
of
an
openly
jewish
institution
speaking
for
jewish
interests
no
matter
how
insistently
is
an
excellent
thing
it
presents
a
healthy
contrast
with
the
converse
attempt
to
present
jewish
arguments
under
the
cover
of
neutrality
and
to
spread
jewish
ideas
anonymously
through
what
are
very
far
from
being
neutral
agents
if
i
be
asked
what
institutions
i
have
in
mind
i
can
only
repeat
that
it
is
for
the
jews
themselves
to
make
the
first
proposal
but
i
suggest
an
extension
of
the
system
which
is
already
present
in
embryo
whereby
disputes
between
jews
shall
be
arbitrated
before
a
jewish
tribunal
not
only
its
extension
but
its
confirmation
at
the
request
of
the
jews
themselves
might
be
a
good
thing
it
would
also
not
be
a
bad
thing
if
some
time
hence
when
things
were
ripe
for
the
change
disputes
between
jews
and
could
be
tried
in
courts
where
the
special
character
of
such
disputes
the
distinctive
difference
between
them
and
disputes
between
the
of
the
country
in
which
they
live
should
come
before
tribunals
of
a
mixed
character
to
attempt
this
would
of
course
be
a
very
new
departure
in
procedure
indeed
a
revolutionary
one
and
there
is
no
prospect
of
it
for
a
long
while
but
with
the
growing
number
among
us
and
the
growing
influence
of
jews
it
will
i
think
when
it
does
come
at
last
be
of
advantage
to
both
parties
it
would
be
fatal
if
it
were
imposed
upon
them
it
would
not
be
accepted
it
would
not
work
but
if
it
were
suggested
by
the
jewish
community
spontaneously
and
started
and
developed
by
them
it
would
succeed
and
it
would
add
a
great
deal
to
the
relief
already
experienced
for
the
functioning
of
the
other
institutions
i
have
mentioned
there
is
little
more
to
be
said
under
this
head
apart
from
the
duty
of
open
dealing
and
this
specific
policy
of
fostering
separate
institutions
we
have
no
claim
to
press
all
the
main
part
of
the
mutual
duty
is
on
side
therefore
have
i
given
it
the
space
it
seems
to
deserve
and
confined
to
no
more
than
these
few
lines
correlative
suggestions
for
those
who
after
all
are
not
responsible
to
us
for
their
actions
and
may
properly
resent
the
airing
of
views
on
the
domestic
details
of
their
alien
organization
various
theories
chapter
xiv
various
theories
before
approaching
my
conclusion
it
may
be
well
to
review
certain
subsidiary
theories
which
i
have
not
hitherto
touched
in
my
discussion
because
they
stand
apart
from
its
argument
there
is
a
whole
group
of
historical
and
other
theories
upon
the
position
of
the
jews
which
either
imply
that
there
is
no
problem
or
if
there
is
one
that
it
can
not
be
solved
or
even
that
if
there
is
a
problem
it
is
of
a
sort
that
does
not
need
solution
because
that
solution
would
be
of
no
practical
value
there
come
in
the
first
place
those
theories
upon
the
international
position
of
the
jews
which
are
frankly
and
which
vary
from
those
which
may
be
defended
with
some
show
of
reason
from
the
history
of
the
past
to
those
which
are
wholly
imaginary
none
of
these
even
though
some
one
of
them
should
be
true
can
find
much
place
here
because
none
lends
itself
to
discussion
thus
there
is
the
conception
of
a
curse
the
conception
that
israel
must
until
its
conversion
suffer
a
perpetual
pilgrimage
and
perpetual
hostility
it
is
a
statement
bound
up
with
that
other
popular
prophecy
that
in
the
last
days
israel
will
be
reconciled
with
the
universal
church
those
who
have
these
ideas
at
the
back
of
their
minds
they
are
more
numerous
than
modern
thought
would
like
to
admit
at
heart
despair
of
any
solution
and
would
not
attempt
to
urge
it
with
any
hope
of
success
they
say
the
thing
is
fated
and
must
continue
but
even
they
i
think
must
admit
that
just
as
philosophy
admits
a
paradox
of
determination
and
free
will
so
political
effort
must
admit
a
paradox
of
foreseen
failures
and
our
duty
in
spite
of
them
to
aim
at
a
political
good
whether
it
be
indeed
true
or
not
that
reconciliation
is
impossible
and
that
in
the
long
run
the
quarrel
must
drag
itself
out
it
is
certainly
profoundly
immoral
to
look
on
at
the
spectacle
with
no
attempt
to
ameliorate
its
evils
there
is
again
the
theory
which
i
mention
in
passing
and
leave
to
its
adherents
that
the
british
and
the
jews
are
in
some
way
mysteriously
allied
by
providence
so
that
any
solution
which
does
not
give
the
fullest
satisfaction
to
israel
no
matter
at
what
cost
to
poor
japhet
is
treason
these
people
mystically
regard
britain
as
the
handmaid
of
jewry
and
there
is
a
section
of
them
who
further
regard
their
as
the
ten
lost
tribes
i
have
in
my
library
some
specimens
of
their
literature
there
is
an
opposite
and
to
me
detestable
theory
but
i
must
mention
it
because
it
exists
that
the
antagonism
hitherto
found
perpetually
whether
latent
or
active
between
this
people
and
the
world
about
them
is
the
use
of
the
one
as
a
necessary
and
divine
oppressor
of
the
other
to
those
who
hold
such
a
theory
i
can
only
reply
that
two
can
play
at
that
game
and
it
certainly
absolves
those
whom
they
would
oppress
from
any
obligation
whatever
of
seeking
a
solution
on
their
side
if
a
man
thinks
he
can
do
harm
to
israel
wantonly
without
suffering
the
reproaches
of
his
own
conscience
he
is
in
error
and
i
confess
that
were
i
free
as
i
am
not
in
a
book
of
discussion
and
argument
to
indulge
in
mere
affirmation
i
should
be
inclined
to
say
that
those
who
set
out
with
this
remarkable
object
in
view
will
catch
a
tartar
there
is
the
opposite
theory
that
a
special
and
divine
protection
is
still
exercised
not
only
for
the
preservation
of
the
jews
but
for
judgment
upon
their
enemies
theory
i
think
lies
at
the
back
of
many
a
jewish
action
in
history
and
of
much
jewish
policy
religious
in
origin
it
is
i
fancy
to
very
many
of
the
race
which
has
suffered
so
much
a
consolation
and
a
support
now
all
these
theories
i
use
the
word
without
any
bad
connotation
the
what
is
often
inaccurately
called
the
mystical
attitude
towards
any
problem
may
well
be
more
practical
than
the
rational
approach
to
it
i
leave
on
one
side
as
improper
to
rational
discussion
i
have
heard
it
maintained
again
by
both
parties
to
this
debate
that
the
presence
of
an
alien
force
migratory
intense
full
of
tradition
experience
and
cohesion
was
essential
to
the
height
and
the
activity
of
our
own
civilization
these
are
not
content
to
discover
individual
instances
of
jewish
excellence
in
the
mass
around
them
or
to
extend
the
renown
of
individual
jewish
genius
they
are
rather
concerned
with
the
general
proposition
that
such
flux
is
necessary
to
the
full
action
of
a
high
and
diverse
culture
they
tell
us
that
but
for
the
jew
the
civilization
of
europe
would
have
grown
torpid
would
have
settled
into
a
fixed
groove
incapable
of
change
and
of
creative
progress
the
jew
by
this
theory
is
regarded
as
a
sort
of
activating
principle
who
whether
as
an
irritant
at
the
worst
or
an
inspiration
at
the
best
keeps
all
our
european
life
agog
and
is
necessary
to
its
continuous
business
these
also
incline
to
see
the
jew
at
the
origin
of
every
great
movement
in
european
thought
they
see
him
indirectly
producing
the
vast
transformation
of
the
roman
empire
from
a
pagan
not
indeed
to
a
jew
but
to
a
christian
that
is
in
their
eyes
to
an
oriental
mood
they
see
the
jew
at
the
root
of
the
great
revolutionary
philosophy
which
springs
from
the
eleventh
century
and
reaches
its
culmination
in
the
great
scholastics
of
the
thirteenth
they
insist
upon
the
name
of
averroës
ibn
roshd
the
philosopher
of
the
twelfth
century
the
kadi
of
cordova
the
exponent
of
aristotle
the
expositor
whom
the
jews
preserved
upon
the
great
moses
ben
maimon
our
maimonides
these
also
put
nicolas
de
lyra
at
the
root
of
the
reformation
lyra
non
lyrasset
luther
non
but
i
may
remind
them
that
the
jewish
character
of
this
man
is
at
least
doubtful
that
he
was
of
the
religious
orders
of
christendom
these
also
will
certainly
and
with
some
reason
ascribe
to
jewish
influence
the
great
economic
revolution
of
the
seventeenth
century
which
has
been
followed
by
so
vast
an
extension
of
wealth
and
of
population
though
hardly
of
human
happiness
now
for
all
this
there
is
certainly
something
to
be
said
as
an
aspect
of
historical
truth
how
far
it
may
be
extended
to
cover
as
its
exponents
would
make
it
cover
the
whole
historical
field
may
be
debated
but
i
would
ask
my
readers
to
consider
what
change
we
should
have
seen
in
the
development
of
europe
if
by
some
magical
instrument
jewish
influence
had
been
upon
some
one
date
removed
it
is
a
theory
fascinating
in
a
way
applicable
and
arresting
it
is
at
any
rate
not
nonsense
it
is
particularly
true
that
something
in
the
continuous
exercise
of
analysis
by
the
jewish
intelligence
perpetually
moves
european
intelligence
to
action
the
great
disputations
of
the
early
middle
ages
were
largely
either
directly
disputations
with
jews
or
disputations
provoked
by
the
intellectual
attitude
of
the
jew
and
the
jew
in
the
famous
name
of
spinoza
stands
at
the
origin
of
that
merely
natural
that
lucretian
interpretation
of
the
world
which
continued
through
descartes
to
its
great
expansion
in
the
present
day
you
find
that
element
in
economics
as
you
do
in
philosophy
in
political
science
as
you
do
in
economics
and
talking
of
economics
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
greatest
name
at
the
foundation
of
modern
economic
science
is
the
name
of
a
jew
ricardo
while
the
most
prominent
name
in
the
development
of
its
most
prominent
direct
application
is
also
a
jewish
name
the
name
of
karl
marx
it
is
not
without
significance
that
any
one
of
these
names
recalls
side
by
side
with
its
jewish
origin
an
aloofness
from
the
general
community
of
the
jews
that
community
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
abandoned
spinoza
ricardo
and
i
believe
karl
marx
were
alien
to
the
national
religion
and
the
latter
married
out
of
his
people
and
exercised
his
enormous
influence
extraneously
to
the
blood
from
which
his
family
sprang
for
though
it
is
true
that
the
the
of
communism
is
jewish
yet
its
convinced
adherents
are
in
the
mass
of
our
blood
and
in
that
connection
i
am
reminded
of
another
theory
or
fact
attaching
to
the
history
of
israel
which
is
that
the
intellectual
independence
of
the
jew
has
been
as
marked
throughout
the
ages
as
his
solidarity
there
are
many
i
know
of
that
nation
who
regard
such
exceptions
as
vagaries
and
almost
condemn
them
as
traitors
yet
they
are
no
small
asset
to
the
reputation
of
their
people
and
their
names
however
much
they
may
be
repudiated
by
their
compatriots
shed
lustre
upon
the
whole
body
from
which
they
sprang
these
include
let
it
be
remembered
not
only
the
sceptical
philosophers
not
only
the
materialists
but
also
those
extraordinary
exceptions
who
have
lent
the
vigour
the
tenacity
and
the
lustre
of
the
jewish
intellect
to
the
service
of
the
catholic
church
i
make
bold
to
say
that
in
no
one
of
the
faith
has
there
been
more
devotion
than
in
those
who
like
ratisbonne
and
he
was
but
one
among
many
have
put
such
qualities
at
the
service
of
what
they
have
discovered
to
be
alone
divine
a
cynic
might
add
paul
but
for
that
matter
the
whole
origin
of
the
church
was
intermixed
with
the
intense
individual
efforts
of
such
men
in
this
connection
also
every
wise
man
will
admit
that
there
is
no
greater
error
than
to
exaggerate
the
consciousness
of
jewish
action
whether
the
error
proceed
from
those
who
admire
or
who
detest
it
to
hear
their
modern
opponents
talk
one
might
imagine
that
the
jewish
people
formed
a
small
club
of
which
every
member
knew
every
other
while
each
worked
in
the
unison
of
a
disciplined
body
that
aberration
i
have
dealt
with
more
than
once
upon
former
pages
the
truth
is
that
no
nation
on
earth
presents
so
many
surprising
exceptions
to
its
general
action
as
does
this
nation
and
that
no
nation
on
earth
when
it
moves
in
one
general
direction
as
it
often
does
is
actuated
by
a
common
motive
less
conscious
we
who
stand
outside
the
jewish
body
may
mark
its
cohesion
and
will
mark
it
i
hope
to
its
honour
but
its
own
members
complain
rather
of
its
lack
of
cohesion
i
have
heard
them
complain
i
know
not
how
often
of
the
way
in
which
the
wealthier
jews
left
their
society
for
that
of
an
alien
body
sneered
at
the
general
body
of
israel
and
remained
indifferent
to
the
common
cry
of
the
race
it
is
this
unconsciousness
in
action
this
frequent
replacement
of
motive
by
instinct
which
accounts
for
what
all
observers
have
noticed
especially
in
times
of
persecution
i
mean
the
bewilderment
of
the
oppressed
at
the
action
of
their
oppressors
i
remember
once
listening
to
a
most
eloquent
speech
delivered
in
the
course
of
a
debate
in
which
with
that
long
recollection
which
is
characteristic
of
his
people
an
israelite
passionately
declaimed
the
gratitude
of
that
people
to
bernard
who
saved
their
remnant
upon
the
rhine
from
the
popular
fury
i
remember
also
how
another
in
a
debate
for
i
have
attended
many
such
up
and
down
the
country
and
have
heard
from
as
many
aspects
as
possible
what
the
jewish
attitude
towards
us
is
stated
simply
in
reply
to
my
description
of
the
jewish
financial
position
in
this
country
after
the
conquest
your
cathedral
and
your
abbeys
and
even
your
castles
were
built
with
money
the
phrase
was
significant
of
the
way
in
which
what
the
english
community
of
the
time
regarded
as
a
tolerated
abuse
those
fortunes
which
never
thought
of
as
jewish
at
all
but
as
moneys
temporarily
unjustly
wrung
from
the
people
at
large
were
regarded
in
contemporary
jewry
as
private
property
legitimately
acquired
held
in
full
possession
i
could
wish
in
this
connection
that
some
learned
jew
would
produce
a
history
of
europe
from
the
point
of
view
of
his
people
a
short
textbook
i
mean
intended
for
our
consumption
to
show
us
ourselves
from
a
standpoint
very
different
from
our
own
it
may
be
that
such
a
book
exists
i
am
certain
it
would
be
more
useful
than
those
indirect
attacks
for
they
are
attacks
upon
the
christian
tradition
which
pretend
to
a
spirit
of
impartiality
but
are
none
the
less
hostile
to
that
tradition
in
every
line
i
would
much
rather
read
the
story
of
europe
as
it
was
seen
by
a
practising
jewish
scholar
than
a
impartial
and
agnostic
account
which
grotesquely
represents
the
church
as
something
external
to
the
body
of
europe
and
even
inimical
to
it
in
this
connection
also
we
should
have
what
now
we
lack
and
that
is
a
conspectus
of
the
jewish
action
over
christendom
and
islam
combined
we
are
aware
of
the
tolerance
or
rather
favour
displayed
to
their
jewish
subjects
by
the
mohammedans
of
spain
it
was
neither
universal
nor
continuous
what
we
do
not
sufficiently
hear
what
we
have
to
piece
together
from
chance
allusions
is
the
connection
between
the
moorish
jews
before
and
during
the
reconquista
and
their
fellows
to
the
north
before
i
leave
these
cursory
and
sporadic
notes
on
what
i
have
called
the
theories
upon
our
problem
i
should
mention
one
which
would
unhappily
seem
to
have
acquired
widespread
support
and
which
is
surely
the
least
satisfactory
of
all
even
less
satisfactory
than
the
now
dying
fiction
which
pretended
that
the
jewish
nation
was
not
present
in
our
midst
but
consisted
only
of
a
mass
of
individuals
already
absorbed
by
their
alien
surroundings
i
mean
the
theory
that
it
is
possible
to
continue
in
a
sort
of
simmering
atmosphere
of
partial
repression
with
the
jew
treated
as
something
alien
and
hostile
yet
his
presence
unceasingly
tolerated
that
would
seem
to
be
the
imperfect
conclusion
implied
if
not
stated
in
a
hundred
modern
pamphlets
and
discussions
the
authors
of
which
repudiate
the
name
of
though
they
sympathize
apparently
with
action
even
less
logical
than
the
politics
of
the
there
is
no
such
equilibrium
possible
even
if
its
establishment
were
as
moral
as
it
is
in
fact
immoral
if
a
frank
solution
be
not
found
nothing
firm
can
be
established
all
we
shall
be
establishing
will
be
a
violent
and
successive
fluctuation
it
is
impossible
to
maintain
an
attitude
permanently
hostile
to
neighbour
yet
count
on
that
hostility
remaining
permanently
repressed
you
fall
inevitably
along
the
slope
of
such
a
tendency
into
those
excesses
which
it
should
be
our
whole
object
to
condemn
to
foresee
and
to
prevent
you
can
not
continue
as
so
many
modern
men
seem
from
their
conversation
to
wish
with
political
equality
on
the
one
side
and
a
living
spirit
of
enmity
upon
the
other
you
can
not
get
peace
by
giving
a
mere
legal
definition
to
the
status
of
a
minority
which
is
also
necessarily
your
neighbour
and
refusing
a
social
action
consonant
with
the
legal
definition
if
you
try
to
do
that
you
are
trying
to
do
two
things
one
of
which
will
destroy
the
other
no
one
can
doubt
which
will
be
victorious
in
a
conflict
between
a
living
sentient
motive
and
a
mere
definition
in
public
law
one
attitude
towards
the
question
which
i
have
heard
fairly
often
in
the
mouths
of
jews
and
seen
in
their
writings
is
something
like
this
our
affairs
have
nothing
to
do
with
people
outside
our
nation
this
discussion
of
what
you
call
jewish
problem
is
an
impertinence
upon
your
part
there
is
a
jewish
problem
indeed
but
it
is
a
domestic
problem
and
we
request
you
with
some
asperity
to
mind
your
own
business
if
this
attitude
were
sound
the
search
for
what
i
have
called
a
solution
though
it
might
satisfy
the
intelligence
would
be
a
breach
of
civic
morals
in
the
same
way
it
would
be
a
breach
of
civic
morals
for
me
to
work
out
a
solution
for
the
quarrel
between
jones
and
his
neither
of
whom
i
have
ever
met
and
with
whom
i
have
no
relations
and
then
to
press
this
solution
upon
the
contending
parties
but
the
flaw
in
this
attitude
is
that
the
problem
is
essentially
one
involving
two
parties
the
jews
and
the
the
problem
we
are
attempting
to
solve
is
a
problem
expressed
in
terms
of
both
some
would
even
say
that
there
is
hardly
a
domestic
question
within
the
jewish
nation
which
does
not
have
its
reaction
upon
society
outside
it
and
which
it
is
not
the
business
of
that
society
outside
to
inquire
into
that
would
be
pressing
things
rather
far
but
the
main
problem
is
intimately
concerned
with
both
parties
and
as
much
with
the
one
as
with
the
other
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
consequences
of
a
false
solution
or
of
shirking
the
solution
altogether
would
be
more
acute
for
the
jew
than
for
us
but
we
should
both
suffer
and
even
on
our
side
the
suffering
would
be
grievous
even
if
there
were
no
question
of
suffering
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
term
there
would
still
be
the
question
of
justice
the
jews
who
resent
a
statement
of
the
problem
and
an
attempt
at
solving
it
are
not
doing
their
own
people
any
good
and
are
at
the
same
time
denying
us
the
right
of
putting
our
own
affairs
in
order
which
denial
is
of
course
intolerable
for
the
position
of
the
jews
in
our
great
states
and
in
islamic
society
is
something
which
those
states
and
that
society
have
to
determine
they
can
not
leave
it
in
the
air
to
some
conclusion
they
come
and
soon
and
on
the
nature
of
that
conclusion
depends
their
peace
two
theories
proceeding
from
very
different
states
of
mind
the
opposite
each
of
the
other
but
each
exclusive
of
any
solution
spring
from
the
root
idea
that
there
is
something
inexorably
malignant
in
the
relations
between
the
jew
and
his
surroundings
in
the
one
form
this
takes
the
shape
of
affirming
that
the
unfortunate
jew
is
invariably
by
his
wicked
hosts
and
always
will
be
so
in
the
other
it
takes
the
form
of
saying
that
the
wicked
jew
will
always
be
conspiring
and
trying
to
hurt
his
good
kind
hosts
and
always
will
be
so
conspiring
in
either
case
it
is
no
good
trying
to
find
a
solution
for
it
is
affirmed
that
the
quarrel
is
in
the
nature
of
things
people
will
say
to
one
why
attempt
to
change
something
which
can
not
be
changed
why
talk
of
your
material
as
something
other
than
what
it
is
cats
will
always
quarrel
with
dogs
and
if
you
want
to
avoid
a
quarrel
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
the
dogs
and
cats
of
your
household
apart
it
is
precisely
because
i
do
not
believe
either
form
of
this
idea
to
be
true
that
i
have
sought
for
a
solution
i
do
not
believe
either
form
of
doctrine
to
be
true
because
the
evidence
is
against
it
that
evidence
is
to
my
hand
and
can
be
examined
by
my
own
unaided
powers
as
it
can
be
examined
by
any
other
person
in
our
modern
society
i
can
not
recollect
one
single
case
in
all
the
hundreds
of
jews
i
have
come
across
not
one
in
the
score
whom
i
can
count
as
intimates
who
showed
any
sign
of
this
malignant
hatred
i
have
heard
many
outbursts
of
exasperation
which
when
we
think
of
the
past
are
natural
enough
but
of
some
persistent
and
evil
desire
to
hurt
those
among
whom
they
live
some
instinctive
desire
unconnected
with
past
suffering
and
acting
as
a
sort
of
instinct
i
have
seen
no
trace
if
such
were
to
be
discovered
in
some
exceptional
jew
out
of
a
large
acquaintance
i
should
conclude
that
it
might
be
true
of
a
small
minority
but
common
sense
and
common
experience
are
sufficient
to
show
that
it
does
not
affect
the
mass
of
the
causes
of
friction
even
of
acute
friction
which
i
have
enumerated
in
former
pages
there
is
the
habit
of
secrecy
there
is
the
mutual
contempt
arising
in
each
from
a
sense
of
superiority
over
the
other
there
is
the
quarrel
between
what
is
national
and
what
is
international
between
what
is
of
us
and
what
is
alien
there
are
in
a
word
plenty
of
elements
suggesting
accidental
antagonism
but
of
intrinsic
antagonism
there
is
no
evidence
there
is
no
evidence
i
mean
that
the
jews
would
still
desire
to
destroy
a
society
in
which
they
found
themselves
at
their
ease
and
if
we
examine
ourselves
we
shall
be
equally
convinced
that
there
is
no
corresponding
desire
upon
our
side
to
do
a
wrong
to
the
jew
we
also
are
exasperated
by
the
memory
of
insult
in
moments
of
quarrel
of
international
action
opposing
our
national
interests
and
of
friction
between
what
is
native
and
what
is
alien
but
that
is
a
very
different
thing
from
permanent
and
necessary
antagonism
i
know
very
well
what
is
called
modern
thought
gives
to
the
unconscious
part
of
man
a
large
place
and
reduces
as
much
as
it
can
the
field
of
reason
i
can
not
agree
with
it
it
seems
to
me
that
man
is
essentially
rational
and
his
political
relations
can
be
arranged
consonantly
with
his
conscious
morals
and
his
conscious
logic
at
any
rate
if
they
can
not
there
is
an
end
of
all
statesmanship
and
of
all
useful
political
action
even
in
details
next
there
are
the
two
converse
attitudes
towards
the
question
which
certainly
are
affecting
the
one
an
increasing
audience
upon
our
side
and
the
other
perhaps
an
interested
though
but
secret
audience
upon
the
other
i
mean
those
two
converse
theories
whereby
on
the
one
side
there
is
the
messianic
idea
of
the
jew
ultimately
controlling
the
world
on
the
other
an
extreme
dread
of
that
idea
and
a
belief
that
it
is
being
actively
pursued
to
the
destruction
of
our
institutions
and
religion
i
can
understand
that
with
the
traditions
of
his
race
behind
him
and
with
the
tone
of
their
sacred
writings
in
his
ears
a
jew
should
lean
in
some
degree
to
such
a
conception
or
at
any
rate
that
some
jews
should
lean
towards
it
certainly
in
face
of
the
ridiculously
exaggerated
power
of
the
jews
in
recent
times
it
is
now
declining
for
secrecy
was
of
its
essence
and
it
has
now
been
brought
into
the
arena
of
open
discussion
it
was
natural
that
men
should
fall
into
the
exaggeration
of
panic
they
saw
the
jew
a
tiny
fraction
of
most
communities
not
more
than
a
twentieth
of
any
community
exercising
a
power
quite
out
of
proportion
to
his
numbers
or
indeed
to
his
ability
and
they
saw
that
power
directed
towards
ends
which
were
jewish
ends
and
therefore
hostile
or
indifferent
to
the
rest
of
mankind
but
my
reason
for
rejecting
not
only
exaggerations
of
this
idea
but
its
fundamental
implication
is
that
it
seems
to
me
practically
impossible
it
connotes
abilities
upon
the
jewish
side
a
continuous
will
upon
the
jewish
side
both
of
which
are
obviously
absent
and
you
have
only
to
look
at
history
to
see
that
long
before
things
come
to
anything
like
a
struggle
for
supremacy
it
is
the
jew
who
suffers
most
from
the
suspicion
of
holding
such
a
design
not
we
indeed
that
is
one
of
the
important
elements
in
the
dangerous
situation
which
has
been
created
that
large
and
greatly
increasing
body
of
men
who
so
fear
jewish
domination
and
are
vigorously
reacting
against
the
jews
under
the
influence
of
that
fear
are
much
more
likely
to
end
with
injustice
to
the
jew
than
with
subservience
to
him
it
is
from
this
atmosphere
that
the
great
misfortunes
of
the
past
have
arisen
it
is
of
the
essence
of
any
solution
that
this
mood
should
be
exorcised
upon
the
one
side
as
upon
the
other
there
is
another
theory
which
i
have
read
of
in
more
than
one
learned
jewish
treatise
and
which
has
been
repeated
after
jewish
authors
themselves
had
launched
it
by
many
societies
and
historians
to
the
effect
that
the
very
survival
of
the
jews
their
very
existence
as
a
separate
community
was
due
to
conditions
common
in
the
past
now
disappeared
and
that
therefore
the
present
difficulties
can
safely
be
left
to
time
this
is
of
course
to
make
the
general
assertion
that
the
jewish
race
can
be
absorbed
and
that
absorption
is
the
solution
that
conclusion
i
summarily
rejected
in
the
earlier
pages
of
this
book
on
the
historical
ground
that
it
has
had
the
most
favourable
circumstances
for
success
and
yet
has
always
failed
but
in
the
particular
case
stated
it
has
an
argument
of
its
own
and
one
needing
very
special
examination
it
is
this
those
who
defend
this
theory
tell
us
that
however
favourable
the
opportunities
for
absorption
were
in
the
past
they
are
nothing
to
the
opportunities
of
the
present
and
the
future
and
that
therefore
the
argument
from
history
fails
in
the
past
they
tell
us
the
jews
were
exclusive
and
even
made
of
their
exclusiveness
a
religion
they
on
their
side
mixed
as
little
as
possible
with
the
world
around
them
and
we
on
our
side
maintained
that
exclusion
by
an
equal
insistence
upon
the
difference
between
ourselves
and
them
we
had
in
those
days
it
is
maintained
a
religion
based
upon
the
incarnation
and
therefore
abhorrent
to
the
jew
that
religion
is
dead
or
dying
and
with
it
the
tendency
to
exclusion
from
outside
has
disappeared
while
on
the
jewish
side
there
is
also
a
great
weakening
of
the
old
religious
bond
less
of
the
old
messianic
dogma
and
on
both
sides
the
enormous
that
makes
for
absorption
with
an
intensity
and
rapidity
quite
unknown
in
the
past
it
was
one
thing
to
absorb
the
jew
when
it
took
a
month
to
go
as
an
ordinary
traveller
from
london
to
rome
it
is
another
thing
when
it
takes
three
days
it
was
one
thing
to
absorb
the
jew
when
in
the
greater
part
of
cases
there
was
a
bar
to
the
mixing
of
the
races
based
upon
the
nerves
of
religion
it
is
quite
another
thing
to
absorb
the
jew
when
those
most
powerful
of
emotional
forces
have
disappeared
and
so
forth
now
the
reasons
which
bring
me
to
reject
this
theory
are
in
the
first
place
i
think
it
exaggerates
the
contrast
between
the
past
and
the
present
in
the
second
place
i
know
that
in
the
actual
world
before
me
and
precisely
under
those
conditions
where
the
fusion
the
action
of
the
ought
to
be
most
complete
the
most
violent
reaction
against
absorption
is
to
be
observed
as
to
the
contrast
between
the
past
and
the
present
i
think
it
is
based
upon
an
imperfect
apprehension
of
what
our
past
has
been
it
comes
of
that
telescoping
up
of
history
to
which
i
alluded
in
another
connection
in
my
second
chapter
the
long
story
of
our
race
between
the
roman
occupation
of
judæa
and
the
modern
local
and
ephemeral
industrial
phase
of
the
great
modern
towns
is
not
divided
into
two
chapters
the
strange
past
and
the
comprehensible
present
it
is
much
of
a
muchness
the
constant
developments
which
astonish
us
in
physical
science
for
instance
are
not
more
remarkable
than
the
vast
new
developments
in
architecture
and
philosophy
which
marked
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
the
disturbance
of
thought
which
may
be
called
modern
scepticism
is
not
anything
like
so
important
a
spiritual
change
as
that
tremendous
revolution
which
we
call
the
conversion
of
the
roman
empire
the
area
of
scepticism
is
not
larger
than
it
has
been
in
many
special
periods
of
the
past
the
feeling
of
strong
religious
emotion
which
forbids
this
or
that
action
is
still
present
among
us
sometimes
attached
to
its
older
objects
sometimes
as
in
the
craze
for
prohibition
to
some
novel
object
the
indifference
which
you
will
find
to
the
particular
religious
barrier
between
jew
and
is
not
peculiar
to
our
times
it
has
come
and
gone
in
the
past
after
a
wave
of
such
indifference
you
have
had
a
wave
of
the
most
acute
reaction
and
i
think
you
are
observing
a
wave
of
such
reaction
nor
do
i
see
how
the
rapidity
of
mere
physical
communications
affects
the
matter
nor
even
how
the
volume
of
emigration
affects
the
matter
you
can
get
a
million
jews
from
lithuania
to
new
york
a
distance
of
miles
in
less
time
than
you
could
get
a
million
jews
from
the
valley
of
the
rhine
into
poland
some
centuries
ago
but
the
million
jews
seem
to
remain
jews
just
the
same
under
modern
conditions
as
they
did
in
the
past
indeed
the
toleration
of
jews
the
friendly
reception
of
them
and
therefore
the
opportunities
for
their
absorption
were
indefinitely
greater
in
mediaeval
poland
than
they
are
in
modern
america
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
of
this
part
of
the
argument
is
based
upon
that
prevalent
view
of
history
which
comes
from
reading
our
little
modern
and
our
little
modern
are
very
rubbishy
it
is
a
view
which
comes
from
that
absurd
emphasis
upon
whatever
is
contemporary
the
modern
advance
of
physical
science
is
regarded
as
having
totally
changed
the
world
inwardly
as
well
as
outwardly
we
have
only
to
look
at
the
modern
world
and
to
compare
it
with
any
distant
special
periods
we
know
to
discover
that
the
difference
between
any
pair
of
these
three
is
equally
striking
in
many
ways
the
modern
world
is
much
more
like
the
world
of
the
antonines
than
it
is
like
the
world
of
innocent
the
great
in
many
ways
the
world
of
innocent
the
great
is
much
more
like
the
roman
empire
than
the
modern
world
in
many
ways
the
world
of
innocent
the
great
and
our
world
have
more
in
common
than
either
has
with
the
pagan
roman
empire
the
general
lesson
is
therefore
that
our
time
with
all
its
remarkable
specialities
is
but
one
specimen
out
of
a
great
number
equally
individual
and
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
it
either
of
religious
scepticism
breaking
down
old
religious
barriers
or
of
rapidity
of
communication
or
of
any
other
fundamental
factor
which
specially
suggests
the
absorption
of
the
jew
for
instance
the
jews
mixed
much
more
readily
on
a
much
more
equal
footing
and
with
far
less
friction
among
the
mohammedans
at
particular
periods
during
the
islamic
occupation
of
spain
than
they
do
even
in
england
yet
they
were
not
absorbed
there
any
more
than
they
were
absorbed
in
poland
they
were
not
absorbed
into
that
older
tolerant
very
denationalized
pagan
roman
world
where
they
so
often
had
full
civic
rights
and
where
they
even
manipulated
as
they
manipulate
the
finances
of
the
community
as
for
the
decay
of
exclusiveness
on
their
part
i
see
no
sign
of
it
for
this
exclusiveness
proceeds
not
so
much
from
a
particular
observance
which
may
relax
at
one
period
and
tighten
up
at
another
as
from
an
invariable
national
tradition
which
fluctuates
in
intensity
but
never
sinks
so
low
as
to
jeopardize
the
continuance
of
the
people
if
we
turn
from
argument
to
observation
the
falsity
of
the
theory
stares
us
in
the
face
we
have
but
to
take
one
point
where
the
metaphor
of
the
most
applies
and
to
which
it
was
originally
applied
the
city
of
new
york
what
has
been
the
effect
of
this
great
influx
of
jews
into
new
york
this
turning
of
new
york
into
a
city
a
third
jewish
under
our
eyes
and
in
so
short
a
space
of
time
as
we
all
know
the
effect
has
been
the
uprising
in
that
once
indifferent
atmosphere
of
such
a
feeling
against
the
jews
as
would
appal
us
did
we
see
it
in
the
old
world
it
is
red
hot
it
is
an
intense
reaction
expressing
itself
with
greater
and
greater
violence
every
day
and
the
spirit
of
that
reaction
can
not
be
better
expressed
than
in
a
phrase
which
we
owe
i
think
to
ford
and
his
famous
propaganda
against
the
jews
through
his
paper
the
dearborn
independent
it
is
all
very
well
to
talk
of
the
says
he
but
so
far
from
the
jews
melting
in
that
pot
looks
as
though
they
wanted
to
melt
the
pot
there
you
have
in
new
york
if
anywhere
an
opportunity
for
the
theory
of
absorption
to
prove
itself
you
have
present
in
the
field
a
score
of
different
races
including
great
masses
of
a
race
so
utterly
different
from
ours
as
the
negro
you
have
a
certain
small
proportion
of
chinamen
and
you
have
of
european
stocks
an
indefinite
variety
most
of
them
in
large
numbers
you
have
not
only
in
local
establishments
or
even
only
in
civic
theory
but
in
actual
practice
in
enthusiastic
practice
a
complete
equality
and
a
positive
pride
in
the
reception
of
no
matter
what
elements
of
immigration
in
the
certitude
that
all
can
rapidly
be
moulded
into
the
american
form
most
of
these
elements
were
absorbed
and
absorbed
rapidly
where
they
were
not
absorbed
there
was
at
least
peace
between
them
then
arrives
the
jew
and
a
totally
new
situation
at
once
appears
a
situation
of
challenge
of
provocation
of
admitted
exclusion
of
violent
debate
and
even
of
clamour
but
no
sign
of
absorption
in
presence
of
all
the
elements
that
should
make
for
absorption
difference
and
hatred
between
jew
and
is
growing
in
new
york
with
the
vitality
of
a
tropical
plant
there
is
yet
another
theory
which
if
it
were
not
widely
held
and
if
it
had
not
been
advanced
by
so
many
jews
themselves
i
should
leave
aside
as
something
comic
something
unfit
for
serious
discussion
but
it
has
been
advanced
and
it
must
be
met
it
is
no
less
than
the
theory
that
there
are
no
such
people
as
the
jews
that
the
whole
thing
is
illusion
this
monstrous
affirmation
is
based
i
need
hardly
say
upon
what
is
called
a
scientific
examination
of
the
affair
for
that
word
scientific
has
come
to
be
associated
with
every
kind
of
unreason
men
especially
jewish
men
have
been
found
to
affirm
most
solemnly
that
they
had
measured
skulls
taken
sections
of
hair
catalogued
the
colours
of
eyes
established
facial
angles
analysed
blood
and
applied
i
know
not
how
many
other
tricks
with
the
result
that
no
jewish
type
could
be
discovered
people
who
can
reason
thus
do
not
seem
to
appreciate
the
fundamental
quarrel
between
nominalism
and
realism
or
to
have
heard
of
the
old
philosophic
joke
on
the
definition
of
a
thing
we
know
a
horse
to
be
a
horse
an
apple
to
be
an
apple
a
chinaman
to
be
a
chinaman
or
a
jew
to
be
a
jew
by
some
process
on
which
philosophers
can
debate
but
upon
the
virtue
of
which
no
sane
man
doubts
and
upon
the
right
action
of
which
we
base
all
our
lives
the
chemist
may
tell
me
that
the
chemical
analysis
of
a
lump
of
coal
gives
the
same
result
as
the
chemical
analysis
of
a
diamond
to
which
any
man
capable
of
using
his
reason
at
all
will
reply
that
upon
a
very
large
number
of
other
lines
of
analysis
colour
touch
combustibility
hardness
and
softness
economic
value
prevalence
and
so
on
indefinitely
the
two
are
the
same
no
analysis
is
complete
and
if
we
had
made
no
conscious
analysis
at
all
we
could
still
perceive
at
once
that
a
lump
of
coal
is
not
a
diamond
it
is
just
the
same
with
these
attempts
to
disprove
obvious
truth
they
pullulate
and
they
are
all
equally
ridiculous
because
they
deduce
from
insufficient
data
the
existence
and
differentiation
of
the
jewish
people
as
a
race
ethnically
and
as
a
nation
politically
is
as
much
a
fact
as
the
existence
of
coal
or
diamonds
they
are
a
nation
politically
because
they
act
as
a
nation
because
their
individual
members
feel
and
exercise
a
corporate
function
we
know
them
to
be
a
separate
race
because
we
can
see
that
they
are
when
you
meet
a
jew
whether
you
are
his
enemy
or
his
friend
you
meet
a
jew
he
has
a
certain
expression
a
certain
manner
certain
physical
characteristics
which
you
may
not
be
able
to
analyse
at
the
moment
you
see
him
but
which
give
you
the
impression
and
the
certitude
that
you
are
dealing
with
a
particular
thing
to
wit
the
jewish
race
it
is
true
of
course
that
the
type
like
all
general
types
fades
off
at
the
edges
and
there
will
always
be
cases
where
you
may
be
in
doubt
of
whether
you
are
dealing
with
a
jew
or
with
a
but
there
is
a
marked
central
type
round
which
the
jewish
racial
type
is
built
up
that
is
as
certain
as
that
there
is
a
mongolian
type
or
a
negroid
type
and
so
forth
i
do
not
take
the
objection
very
seriously
i
only
note
it
because
it
been
made
and
may
crop
up
in
the
course
of
any
discussion
on
this
grave
political
issue
footnote
i
borrow
the
metaphor
from
zangwill
who
applied
it
to
new
york
particularly
i
apply
it
to
the
whole
modern
industrial
world
habit
or
law
chapter
xv
habit
or
law
if
it
be
true
that
the
friction
between
the
jew
and
the
civilization
in
which
he
lives
is
aggravated
by
his
habit
of
secrecy
and
by
our
disingenuousness
by
his
expression
of
a
sense
of
superiority
which
galls
us
and
on
our
side
by
a
lack
of
charity
and
of
intelligence
in
dealing
with
him
it
would
follow
that
no
solution
can
be
more
than
approximate
that
whatever
arrangement
be
come
to
the
contrast
will
remain
and
with
it
a
certain
latent
friction
which
always
accompanies
contrast
but
there
is
between
a
simmering
of
that
kind
and
the
active
boiling
of
the
question
with
the
threat
of
its
boiling
all
the
difference
in
the
world
but
even
though
the
solution
be
imperfect
it
might
be
reasonably
stable
we
might
at
least
have
peace
though
not
friendship
it
further
follows
from
the
elements
of
the
problem
that
the
solution
lies
along
the
lines
of
either
party
modifying
whatever
in
its
action
is
an
irritant
to
the
other
whatever
that
is
can
be
modified
by
the
will
and
is
not
mixed
up
with
something
ineradicable
the
jew
can
not
help
feeling
superior
but
he
can
help
the
expression
of
that
superiority
at
any
rate
he
can
modify
such
expression
he
can
certainly
though
it
be
at
a
great
expense
of
tradition
and
habit
get
rid
of
that
pestilent
of
secrecy
which
poisons
all
the
relations
between
him
and
ourselves
we
on
our
side
can
drop
what
is
the
converse
of
that
secrecy
the
disingenuousness
the
lack
of
candour
into
which
we
are
fallen
in
our
relations
with
the
jew
that
can
not
but
mean
a
great
breach
with
our
tradition
and
with
habit
also
but
the
advantage
is
worth
the
sacrifice
we
can
it
must
be
the
work
of
each
individual
it
can
not
be
a
corporate
work
approach
the
jew
with
more
respect
and
yet
with
more
frequency
we
can
i
think
advance
by
many
degrees
from
the
lack
of
charity
we
now
show
even
if
we
despair
of
living
in
real
intimacy
with
a
people
so
different
in
their
deepest
qualities
from
ourselves
personally
i
am
not
sure
that
such
closer
intimacy
might
not
be
established
i
have
never
found
any
difficulty
in
reaching
and
retaining
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
jews
of
my
own
circle
but
i
may
have
been
fortunate
i
know
that
with
most
of
my
fellows
it
is
not
so
and
perhaps
the
jew
will
always
remain
to
the
mass
of
those
about
him
something
strange
and
unapproachable
and
i
fear
repulsive
but
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
mix
with
that
hesitation
in
our
relations
an
element
of
indifference
still
less
of
contempt
still
less
again
of
cruelty
i
repeat
the
formula
for
a
solution
it
is
recognition
and
respect
recognition
is
here
no
more
than
the
telling
of
the
truth
there
is
a
jewish
nation
jews
are
citizens
of
that
nation
and
recognition
means
not
only
the
telling
of
this
truth
on
special
occasions
but
the
use
of
it
as
a
regular
habit
in
our
relations
on
both
sides
this
statement
is
upon
any
just
analysis
of
the
jewish
question
so
obvious
and
so
simple
that
it
needs
neither
insistence
upon
it
nor
development
its
plain
statement
is
sufficient
but
there
attaches
to
a
solution
so
determined
a
much
more
active
and
complicated
question
upon
the
uncertainty
of
which
not
only
this
reform
but
many
another
has
made
shipwreck
the
question
must
be
answered
rightly
because
if
we
answer
it
wrongly
the
whole
scheme
fails
the
question
is
this
should
the
social
habit
the
general
method
in
writing
and
speaking
and
in
all
relations
precede
in
this
case
the
institutional
action
legal
changes
constitutional
definitions
or
should
the
legal
changes
the
new
institutions
the
constitutional
definitions
come
first
to
decide
rightly
is
of
great
moment
for
this
reason
that
a
wrong
decision
may
destroy
all
the
effect
of
goodwill
in
my
judgment
the
wrong
decision
would
be
that
which
would
give
precedence
to
legal
change
to
new
definitions
to
new
institutions
and
attempt
out
of
them
to
build
a
new
spirit
i
take
it
that
this
reversal
of
the
true
order
would
make
all
stable
peace
impossible
it
must
be
admitted
of
course
that
changes
suggested
by
the
jews
themselves
the
development
of
their
own
institutions
a
voluntary
segregation
of
their
community
in
other
fields
than
those
in
which
they
have
already
effected
that
segregation
stand
in
another
category
these
new
and
definitely
jewish
institutions
we
should
always
welcome
but
the
attempt
at
framing
public
regulations
which
are
to
defend
the
community
as
a
whole
against
an
alien
minority
when
that
minority
must
live
with
one
permanently
and
as
a
regular
feature
of
the
life
of
the
community
invariably
tends
to
oppression
if
such
regulations
are
made
the
first
steps
in
a
settlement
instead
of
being
left
as
they
should
be
to
the
last
any
separatist
legislation
should
arise
naturally
out
of
a
long
practice
and
full
recognition
of
the
jews
as
a
separate
people
and
of
the
accompaniment
of
that
recognition
with
respect
if
the
advance
is
made
on
our
side
the
jew
may
refuse
any
such
bargain
he
may
dig
his
heels
in
and
insist
as
many
another
privileged
class
has
insisted
before
him
that
he
will
continue
to
enjoy
all
that
he
has
ever
enjoyed
that
he
will
continue
his
demand
for
a
dual
allegiance
that
he
will
insist
on
the
very
fullest
recognition
as
a
jew
and
at
the
same
time
on
what
is
fatal
to
such
recognition
the
fullest
recognition
as
a
member
of
our
own
community
if
he
does
and
there
are
those
who
tell
us
he
will
certainly
do
so
and
will
refuse
all
reform
then
the
community
will
be
compelled
to
legislate
in
spite
of
him
it
will
be
perilous
for
him
and
for
us
it
may
even
be
the
beginning
of
grievous
trouble
for
both
but
it
will
be
inevitable
it
will
appear
in
a
mass
of
legislation
all
over
europe
which
will
affect
this
country
with
the
rest
the
present
situation
can
not
last
indefinitely
it
is
already
uncertain
even
here
in
england
it
has
reached
further
stages
on
the
road
to
ruin
elsewhere
but
if
the
jew
sees
the
peril
in
time
and
appreciates
the
nature
of
that
change
the
beginnings
of
which
we
have
all
seen
and
which
is
proceeding
at
so
great
a
pace
then
relations
can
be
established
out
of
which
later
formal
rules
acceptable
to
both
parties
should
proceed
and
in
that
case
it
would
be
i
repeat
the
gravest
of
errors
to
initiate
new
positive
laws
and
a
new
status
before
a
foundation
had
been
prepared
by
the
of
honest
relations
and
that
can
only
be
done
by
a
frank
admission
of
reality
by
the
open
and
continual
admission
everywhere
that
israel
is
a
nation
apart
is
not
and
can
not
be
of
us
and
shall
not
be
confounded
with
ourselves
there
is
great
temptation
to
delay
because
the
acuteness
of
the
problem
is
not
felt
here
as
yet
among
the
and
still
more
because
it
differs
in
different
communities
the
peril
seems
still
far
distant
from
us
though
it
may
be
at
the
very
door
of
our
neighbours
routine
the
inheritance
of
the
immediate
past
the
false
security
produced
by
the
conventions
of
that
past
may
well
tempt
those
who
dislike
the
effort
of
a
change
to
shirk
that
change
but
i
would
ask
any
intelligent
and
thoughtful
jew
who
still
thinks
he
can
rely
upon
the
false
position
of
the
nineteenth
century
whether
the
same
forces
are
there
to
support
him
as
were
present
then
take
a
particular
example
in
poland
and
in
roumania
the
old
fiction
has
been
temporarily
imposed
by
force
the
jew
who
in
both
these
countries
is
felt
to
be
more
alien
than
any
other
foreign
european
could
be
is
imposed
upon
the
government
and
society
of
each
country
by
the
western
governments
as
a
full
citizen
the
strain
here
is
immensely
aggravated
because
it
arose
not
from
the
nature
of
society
but
from
the
action
of
outsiders
the
english
the
french
the
american
governments
but
particularly
the
american
and
the
english
have
erected
in
eastern
europe
this
unstable
unjust
and
artificial
state
of
affairs
it
can
not
last
for
it
is
unreal
the
communities
in
question
may
make
no
laws
which
recognize
the
jew
alternatively
the
door
is
open
for
oppression
and
the
moment
the
hated
foreign
interference
weakens
oppression
will
come
well
when
under
the
pressure
of
a
real
social
difficulty
and
a
crucial
one
the
unreal
settlement
is
torn
up
by
the
passing
of
new
laws
recognizing
the
jew
but
harshly
and
under
no
agreement
with
him
or
by
actual
hostility
does
the
jew
in
his
heart
of
hearts
think
that
he
would
have
the
same
support
from
the
west
now
as
he
would
have
had
thirty
years
ago
he
knows
very
well
he
would
not
thirty
years
ago
you
would
have
got
from
all
the
traditional
liberalism
of
france
from
the
great
bulk
of
its
governing
class
and
the
whole
of
its
academic
organization
from
what
was
then
the
solid
and
still
respected
body
of
old
republicans
an
immediate
answer
to
the
jewish
appeal
in
england
that
answer
would
have
been
unanimous
and
enthusiastic
you
would
have
had
torrents
of
leading
articles
great
public
meetings
cabinet
ministers
speechifying
all
over
the
place
in
the
sacred
cause
of
toleration
every
one
knows
that
the
appeal
of
the
eastern
jews
though
it
might
still
be
supported
officially
would
be
received
by
the
public
with
indifference
ten
years
hence
it
may
be
received
with
derision
or
take
another
example
let
us
suppose
it
is
highly
probable
that
the
zionist
experiment
breaks
down
that
englishmen
refuse
to
have
their
soldiers
lives
risked
in
a
quarrel
which
is
not
their
own
and
refuse
to
support
out
of
their
inordinate
taxation
a
colony
which
gives
them
no
advantage
and
concerns
them
not
at
all
on
the
breakdown
of
that
experiment
should
it
come
soon
would
there
still
be
the
support
for
its
that
you
would
have
had
even
ten
years
ago
there
certainly
would
not
ten
years
hence
it
is
probable
enough
that
you
would
get
not
indifference
to
such
but
the
most
active
hostility
all
over
the
world
the
stream
has
turned
in
the
same
direction
unfortunately
the
effect
of
that
change
has
been
to
excite
hatred
rather
than
a
desire
for
a
settlement
and
to
move
men
towards
blind
action
rather
than
towards
a
reasoned
examination
of
the
difficulty
that
is
why
the
thing
seems
to
me
urgent
although
there
are
still
large
areas
of
western
society
in
which
its
urgency
is
masked
and
half
forgotten
when
i
say
i
mean
that
this
my
essay
which
is
still
to
the
point
and
the
solution
recommended
in
which
is
still
feasible
may
very
well
within
the
lifetime
of
its
writer
become
out
of
all
recognition
the
peaceful
settlement
here
proposed
with
deliberate
vagueness
and
softness
of
outline
may
seem
in
a
few
years
as
out
of
date
as
unreal
through
the
intervening
change
as
do
the
old
tags
about
the
purity
of
parliamentary
life
and
the
seriousness
of
party
politics
my
solution
may
appear
at
the
end
of
this
generation
as
mildly
inapplicable
to
the
acute
situation
arisen
between
the
jews
and
ourselves
as
appear
the
old
debates
on
the
very
tentative
demand
for
home
rule
in
the
let
us
act
as
soon
as
possible
and
settle
the
thing
while
there
is
yet
time
for
in
the
swirl
and
rapids
of
the
modern
world
which
grow
not
less
as
towards
a
calm
but
more
intense
as
towards
a
cataract
every
great
debate
takes
on
with
every
year
a
stronger
form
a
nearer
approach
to
conflict
and
none
more
than
the
immemorial
debate
still
unconcluded
between
islam
and
christendom
and
the
but
for
my
part
i
say
peace
be
to
israel
in
great
britain
butler
tanner
and
