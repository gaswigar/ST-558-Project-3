the
betrothal
now
when
shibli
bagarag
had
ceased
speaking
the
vizier
smiled
gravely
and
shook
his
beard
with
satisfaction
and
said
to
the
eclipser
of
reason
opinest
thou
of
this
nephew
of
the
barber
o
noorna
bin
noorka
she
answered
o
feshnavat
my
father
truly
i
am
content
with
the
bargain
of
my
betrothal
he
wullahy
is
a
fair
youth
of
flowing
speech
then
she
said
thou
him
what
he
opineth
of
me
his
betrothed
so
the
vizier
put
that
interrogation
to
shibli
bagarag
and
the
youth
was
in
perplexity
thinking
it
possible
to
be
joyful
in
the
embrace
of
one
that
hath
brought
thwackings
upon
us
serious
blows
thinking
hath
she
when
the
mood
cometh
kindly
looks
and
i
marked
her
eye
dwelling
on
me
admiringly
and
he
thought
she
that
groweth
younger
and
counteth
nature
backwards
hath
a
history
that
would
affect
me
or
it
may
be
my
kisses
wah
i
like
not
to
give
them
and
it
is
said
love
is
wither
by
the
withered
lip
and
that
on
bones
become
too
prominent
he
trip
yet
put
the
case
that
my
kisses
i
shower
them
not
allah
the
is
my
witness
and
they
be
given
daintily
as
to
the
leaf
of
a
nettle
or
pilau
yet
haply
kisses
repeated
might
restore
her
to
a
bloom
and
it
is
certain
youth
is
somehow
stolen
from
her
if
the
vizier
feshnavat
went
before
her
and
his
blood
be
her
blood
and
he
is
powerful
she
wise
i
decide
to
act
the
part
of
a
rejoicer
and
express
of
her
opinions
honeyed
to
the
soul
of
that
sex
now
while
he
was
thus
debating
he
hung
his
head
and
the
vizier
awaited
his
response
knitting
his
brows
angrily
at
the
delay
and
at
the
last
he
cried
no
answer
how
this
shall
thy
like
dare
hold
debate
when
questioned
of
my
like
and
is
my
daughter
noorna
bin
noorka
thinkest
thou
a
in
the
market
thou
haggling
at
her
price
o
thou
nephew
of
the
barber
so
shibli
bagarag
exclaimed
exalted
one
bestower
of
the
bride
surely
i
debated
with
myself
but
for
appropriate
terms
and
i
delayed
to
select
the
metre
of
the
verse
fitting
my
thoughts
of
her
and
my
wondrous
good
fortune
and
the
honour
done
me
then
the
vizier
us
hear
we
listen
and
shibli
bagarag
was
advised
to
deal
with
illustrations
in
his
dilemma
of
expression
and
spake
in
extemporaneous
verse
and
with
a
full
voice
the
pupils
of
the
sage
for
living
beauty
sought
and
one
a
vision
clasped
and
one
a
model
wrought
have
it
each
exclaimed
and
rivalry
arose
me
thy
maid
of
air
grace
of
clay
disclose
limbs
that
can
not
move
lips
that
melt
away
thou
thy
maid
of
air
up
thy
grace
of
clay
was
thus
contending
hot
they
went
before
the
sage
and
knelt
at
the
wise
wells
of
cold
ascetic
age
fairest
of
the
twain
o
father
thou
record
he
answered
she
who
likest
to
her
lord
said
they
fairer
thing
matched
with
them
might
prevail
the
sage
austerely
smiled
and
said
monkey
tail
is
left
for
his
wisdom
to
declare
that
loveliest
we
best
love
and
to
ourselves
compare
yet
lovelier
than
all
hands
shape
or
fancies
build
the
meanest
thing
of
earth
god
with
his
fire
hath
filled
now
when
shibli
bagarag
ceased
noorna
bin
noorka
cried
o
wondrous
turner
of
verse
thou
that
art
honest
and
she
laughed
loudly
rustling
like
a
bag
of
shavings
and
rolling
in
her
laughter
then
said
she
my
betrothed
is
not
the
thing
thou
wouldst
say
no
other
than
each
to
his
mind
doth
the
fairest
enfold
for
broken
long
since
was
beauty
mould
and
thou
that
art
old
withered
i
can
not
flatter
thee
as
i
can
in
no
way
pay
compliments
to
the
monkey
tail
of
high
design
nevertheless
the
sage
would
do
thee
honour
so
read
i
thy
illustration
o
keen
of
wit
and
thou
art
forgiven
its
boldness
my
betrothed
wullahy
utterly
so
now
the
youth
was
abashed
at
her
discernment
and
the
kindliness
of
her
manner
won
him
to
say
there
many
a
flower
of
sweetness
there
many
a
gem
of
earth
would
thrill
with
bliss
our
being
could
we
perceive
its
worth
o
beauteous
is
creation
in
fashion
and
device
if
i
have
fail
to
think
thee
fair
is
blindness
is
my
vice
and
she
answered
him
i
proved
thy
wit
and
power
of
verse
that
is
at
will
diffuse
and
terse
lest
thou
commence
to
lie
be
dumb
i
am
content
the
time
will
come
then
she
said
to
the
vizier
feshnavat
my
father
there
is
all
in
this
youth
the
nephew
of
the
barber
that
desirable
for
the
undertaking
and
his
feet
will
be
on
a
level
with
the
task
we
propose
for
him
he
the
height
of
man
above
it
is
clear
that
vanity
will
trip
him
but
honesty
is
a
strong
upholder
and
he
is
one
that
hath
the
spirit
of
enterprise
and
the
mask
of
dissimulation
gratitude
i
observe
in
him
and
it
is
as
i
thought
when
i
came
upon
him
on
the
outside
the
city
that
his
star
is
clearly
in
a
web
with
our
star
he
destined
for
the
shaving
of
shagpat
so
the
vizier
replied
hath
had
thwackings
yet
is
he
not
deterred
from
making
further
attempt
on
shagpat
i
think
well
of
him
and
i
augur
hopefully
wullahy
the
cadi
shall
be
sent
for
i
can
sleep
in
his
secresy
and
he
shall
perform
the
ceremonies
of
betrothal
even
now
and
where
we
sit
and
it
shall
be
for
him
to
write
the
terms
of
contract
so
shall
we
bind
the
youth
firmly
to
us
and
he
will
be
one
of
us
as
we
are
devoted
to
the
undertaking
by
three
bonds
the
bond
of
vengeance
the
bond
of
ambition
and
that
of
love
now
so
it
was
that
the
vizier
despatched
a
summons
for
the
attendance
of
the
cadi
and
he
carne
and
performed
between
shibli
bagarag
and
noorna
bin
noorka
ceremonies
of
betrothal
and
wrote
terms
of
contract
and
they
were
witnessed
duly
by
the
legal
number
of
witnesses
and
so
worded
that
he
had
no
claim
on
her
as
wife
till
such
time
as
the
event
to
which
he
bound
himself
was
mastered
then
the
fees
being
paid
and
compliments
interchanged
the
vizier
exclaimed
ye
happy
and
let
the
weak
cling
to
the
strong
and
be
ye
two
to
one
in
this
world
and
no
split
halves
that
betray
division
and
stick
not
together
when
the
gum
is
heated
then
he
made
a
sign
to
the
cadi
and
them
that
had
witnessed
the
contract
to
follow
him
leaving
the
betrothed
ones
to
their
own
company
so
when
they
were
alone
noorna
gazed
on
the
youth
wistfully
and
said
in
a
soft
tone
art
dazed
with
the
adventure
o
youth
surely
there
is
one
kiss
owing
me
art
thou
willing
am
i
reduced
to
beg
it
of
thee
or
thou
he
lifted
his
head
and
replied
so
thereat
he
stood
up
languidly
and
went
to
her
and
kissed
her
and
she
smiled
and
said
wot
it
will
be
otherwise
and
thou
wilt
learn
swiftness
of
limb
brightness
of
eye
and
the
longing
for
earthly
beatitude
when
next
i
ask
thee
o
my
betrothed
lo
while
she
spake
new
light
seemed
in
her
and
it
was
as
if
a
splendid
jewel
were
struggling
to
cast
its
beams
through
the
sides
of
a
crystal
vase
smeared
with
dust
and
old
dirt
and
spinnings
of
the
damp
spider
he
was
amazed
and
cried
this
what
change
is
passing
in
thee
she
said
in
thy
kiss
and
that
i
have
shagpat
then
he
how
had
that
wretch
claim
over
thee
ere
i
came
but
she
looked
fearfully
at
the
corners
of
the
room
and
exclaimed
my
betrothed
speak
not
of
him
in
that
fashion
is
dangerous
and
my
power
can
not
keep
off
his
emissaries
at
all
times
then
she
said
my
betrothed
know
me
a
sorceress
ensorcelled
not
that
i
seem
but
that
i
shall
be
wait
thou
for
the
time
and
it
will
reward
thee
what
thou
to
have
plucked
a
wrinkled
fruit
a
mouldy
pomegranate
under
the
branches
a
sour
tamarind
is
well
i
say
nought
save
that
time
will
come
and
be
thou
content
it
is
truly
as
i
said
that
i
have
thee
between
me
and
shagpat
and
that
honoured
one
of
this
city
thought
fit
in
his
presumption
to
demand
me
in
marriage
at
the
hands
of
my
father
knowing
me
wise
and
knowing
the
thing
that
transformed
me
to
this
the
abominable
fellow
surely
my
father
entertained
not
his
proposal
save
with
scorn
but
the
king
looked
favourably
on
it
and
it
is
even
now
matter
of
reproach
to
feshnavat
my
father
that
he
withholdeth
me
from
shagpat
quoth
shibli
bagarag
clothier
o
noorna
control
the
vizier
and
demand
of
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
and
a
clothier
influence
the
king
against
his
vizier
tis
wullahy
a
riddle
she
replied
even
so
eyes
of
mine
my
betrothed
but
thou
not
shagpat
and
that
he
is
lo
the
king
and
all
of
this
city
save
we
three
are
held
in
enchantment
by
him
and
made
foolish
by
one
hair
that
in
his
head
shibli
bagarag
started
in
his
seat
like
one
that
shineth
with
a
discovery
and
cried
identical
then
she
sighing
that
indeed
but
the
identical
of
identicals
the
chief
and
head
of
them
and
i
woe
me
i
the
planter
of
it
so
he
said
so
but
she
cried
tell
thee
not
here
nor
aught
of
myself
and
him
and
the
genie
held
in
bondage
by
me
till
thou
art
proved
by
adventure
and
we
float
peacefully
on
the
sea
of
the
bright
lily
there
shalt
thou
see
me
as
i
am
and
hear
my
story
and
marvel
at
it
for
is
wondrous
and
a
manifestation
of
the
power
that
dwelleth
unseen
so
shibli
bagarag
pondered
awhile
on
the
strange
nature
of
the
things
she
hinted
and
laughter
seized
him
as
he
reflected
on
shagpat
and
the
whole
city
enchanted
by
one
hair
in
his
head
and
he
exclaimed
noorna
knoweth
he
shagpat
of
the
might
in
him
she
answered
for
his
vain
soul
that
homage
is
paid
to
him
and
he
careth
not
for
the
wherefore
shibli
bagarag
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
carpets
of
the
floor
as
if
reading
there
a
matter
quaintly
written
and
smiled
saying
boldness
was
mine
the
making
offer
to
shear
shagpat
the
lion
in
his
lair
he
that
holdeth
a
whole
city
in
enchantment
wah
was
an
instance
of
daring
and
noorna
said
only
an
entire
city
but
other
cities
affected
by
him
as
witness
oolb
whither
thou
wilt
go
and
there
be
governments
and
states
and
conditions
of
men
remote
that
hang
upon
him
shagpat
is
even
so
i
swell
not
his
size
when
thou
hast
mastered
the
event
and
sent
him
forth
shivering
from
thy
blade
like
the
shorn
lamb
be
known
how
great
a
thing
has
been
achieved
and
a
record
for
the
generations
to
come
choice
is
that
historian
destined
to
record
it
quoth
he
looking
eagerly
at
her
noorna
what
is
it
in
thy
speech
affecteth
me
surely
it
infuseth
the
vigour
of
wine
old
wine
and
i
shiver
with
desire
to
shave
shagpat
and
spin
threads
for
the
historian
to
weave
in
order
i
wullahy
had
but
dry
visions
of
the
greatness
destined
for
me
till
now
my
betrothed
shall
i
master
an
event
in
shaving
him
and
be
told
of
to
future
ages
by
allah
and
his
prophet
praise
be
to
that
name
this
is
greatness
say
noorna
hadst
thou
foreknowledge
of
me
and
my
coming
to
this
city
so
she
said
was
on
the
roofs
one
night
among
the
stars
ere
moonrise
o
my
betrothed
and
was
close
on
the
rise
of
this
very
month
moon
the
star
of
our
enemy
shagpat
was
large
and
red
mine
as
it
were
menaced
by
its
proximity
nigh
swallowed
in
its
haughty
beams
and
the
steady
overbearings
of
its
effulgence
was
so
as
it
had
long
been
when
suddenly
lo
a
star
from
the
upper
heaven
that
shot
down
between
them
wildly
and
my
star
took
lustre
from
it
and
the
star
of
shagpat
trembled
like
a
ring
on
a
tightened
rope
and
waved
and
flickered
and
seemed
to
come
forward
and
to
retire
and
was
presently
as
a
comet
in
the
sky
bright
a
tadpole
with
large
head
and
lengthy
tail
in
the
assembly
of
the
planets
this
i
saw
and
that
the
stranger
star
was
stationed
by
my
star
shielding
it
and
that
it
drew
nearer
to
my
star
and
entered
its
circle
and
that
the
two
stars
seemed
mixing
the
splendour
that
was
theirs
now
that
sight
amazed
me
and
my
heart
in
its
beating
quickened
with
the
expectation
of
things
approaching
surely
i
rendered
praise
and
pressed
both
hands
on
my
bosom
and
watched
and
behold
the
comet
the
illumined
tadpole
was
becoming
restless
beneath
the
joint
rays
of
the
twain
that
were
dominating
him
and
he
diminished
and
lashed
his
tail
uneasily
half
madly
darting
as
do
captured
beasts
from
the
fetters
that
constrain
them
then
went
there
from
thy
star
for
i
know
now
was
thine
a
momentary
flash
across
the
head
of
the
tadpole
and
again
another
and
another
rapidly
pertinaciously
and
from
thy
star
there
passed
repeated
flashes
across
the
head
of
the
tadpole
till
his
brilliance
was
as
severed
from
him
and
he
like
drossy
silver
a
dead
shape
in
the
conspicuous
heavens
and
he
became
yellow
as
the
rolling
eyes
of
sick
wretches
in
pain
and
shrank
in
his
place
like
pale
parchment
at
the
touch
of
flame
dull
was
he
as
an
animal
fascinated
by
fear
and
deprived
of
all
power
to
make
head
against
the
foe
darkness
that
now
beset
him
and
usurped
part
of
his
yet
lively
tail
and
settled
on
his
head
and
coated
part
of
his
body
so
when
this
tadpole
that
was
once
terrible
to
me
became
turbaned
shoed
and
shawled
with
darkness
and
there
was
little
of
him
remaining
visible
lo
a
concluding
flash
shot
from
thy
star
and
he
fell
heavily
down
the
sky
and
below
the
hills
into
the
sea
that
is
the
enchanted
sea
whose
queen
is
rabesqurat
mistress
of
illusions
now
when
my
soul
recovered
from
amazement
at
the
marvels
seen
i
arose
and
went
from
the
starry
roofs
to
consult
my
books
of
magic
and
was
revealed
to
me
that
one
was
wandering
to
a
junction
with
my
destiny
and
that
by
his
means
the
great
aim
would
of
a
surety
be
accomplished
shagpat
shaved
so
my
purpose
was
to
discover
him
and
i
made
calculations
and
summoned
them
that
serve
me
to
search
for
such
a
youth
as
thou
art
fairly
o
my
betrothed
did
i
preconceive
thee
and
so
it
was
that
i
traced
a
magic
line
from
the
to
the
city
and
from
the
outer
hills
to
the
and
whoso
approached
by
that
line
i
knew
was
he
marked
out
as
my
champion
my
betrothed
a
youth
destined
for
great
things
was
i
right
the
egg
hatcheth
thou
art
already
proved
by
thwackings
seasoned
to
the
undertaking
and
i
doubt
not
thou
art
he
that
will
finish
with
that
tadpole
shagpat
and
sit
in
the
high
seat
thy
name
an
odour
in
distant
lands
a
joy
to
the
historian
the
compiler
of
events
thou
master
of
the
event
the
greatest
which
time
will
witness
for
ages
to
come
when
she
had
spoken
shibli
bagarag
considered
her
words
and
the
knowledge
that
he
was
selected
by
destiny
as
master
of
the
event
inflated
him
and
he
was
a
hawk
in
eagerness
a
peacock
in
pride
an
ostrich
in
fulness
of
chest
crying
noorna
bin
noorka
really
so
truly
it
must
be
for
the
readers
of
planets
were
also
busy
with
me
at
the
time
of
my
birth
interpreting
of
me
in
excessive
agitation
and
the
thing
they
foretold
is
as
thou
foretellest
i
am
wullahy
marked
i
walk
manifest
in
the
eye
of
providence
thereupon
he
exulted
and
his
mind
strutted
through
the
future
of
his
days
and
down
the
ladder
of
all
time
exacting
homage
from
men
his
brethren
and
was
beyond
the
art
of
noorna
to
fix
him
to
the
present
duties
of
the
enterprise
he
was
as
feathered
seed
before
the
breath
of
vanity
now
while
the
twain
discoursed
she
of
the
preparations
for
shaving
shagpat
he
of
his
completion
of
the
deed
and
the
honours
due
to
him
as
master
of
the
event
feshnavat
the
vizier
returned
to
them
from
his
entertainment
of
the
cadi
and
he
had
bribed
him
to
silence
with
a
mighty
bribe
so
he
called
to
them
be
ye
ready
to
commence
the
work
and
have
ye
advised
together
as
to
the
beginning
true
is
that
triplet
whatever
enterprize
man
hath
for
waking
love
or
curbing
wrath
is
the
first
step
that
makes
a
path
and
how
have
ye
determined
as
to
that
first
step
noorna
replied
my
father
we
have
not
decided
and
there
hath
been
yet
no
deliberation
between
us
as
to
that
then
he
said
this
while
have
ye
talked
and
no
deliberation
as
to
that
lo
i
have
drawn
the
cadi
to
our
plot
and
bribed
him
with
a
mighty
bribe
and
i
have
prepared
possible
disguises
for
this
nephew
of
the
barber
and
i
have
had
the
witnesses
of
thy
betrothal
despatched
to
foreign
parts
far
kingdoms
in
the
land
of
roum
to
prevent
tattling
and
gabbling
and
ye
that
were
left
alone
for
debating
as
to
the
great
deed
ye
have
not
yet
deliberated
as
to
that
known
to
ye
o
gabblers
aught
of
the
punishment
inflicted
by
shahpesh
the
persian
on
khipil
the
builder
a
punishment
that
by
allah
shibli
bagarag
said
of
that
punishment
o
vizier
and
the
vizier
narrated
as
followeth
and
this
is
the
punishment
of
shahpesh
the
persian
on
khipil
the
builder
they
relate
that
shahpesh
the
persian
commanded
the
building
of
a
palace
and
khipil
was
his
builder
the
work
lingered
from
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
shahpesh
even
to
his
fourth
one
day
shahpesh
went
to
the
riverside
where
it
stood
to
inspect
it
khipil
was
sitting
on
a
marble
slab
among
the
stones
and
blocks
round
him
stretched
lazily
the
masons
and
stonecutters
and
slaves
of
burden
and
they
with
the
curve
of
humorous
enjoyment
on
their
lips
for
he
was
reciting
to
them
adventures
interspersed
with
anecdotes
and
recitations
and
poetic
instances
as
was
his
wont
they
were
like
pleased
flocks
whom
the
shepherd
hath
led
to
a
pasture
freshened
with
brooks
there
to
feed
indolently
he
the
shepherd
in
the
midst
now
the
king
said
to
him
khipil
show
me
my
palace
where
it
standeth
for
i
desire
to
gratify
my
sight
with
its
fairness
khipil
abased
himself
before
shahpesh
and
answered
even
here
o
king
of
the
age
where
thou
delightest
the
earth
with
thy
foot
and
the
ear
of
thy
slave
with
sweetness
surely
a
site
of
vantage
one
that
dominateth
earth
air
and
water
which
is
the
builder
first
and
chief
requisition
for
a
noble
palace
a
palace
to
fill
foreign
kings
and
sultans
with
the
distraction
of
envy
and
it
is
o
sovereign
of
the
time
a
site
this
site
i
have
chosen
to
occupy
the
tongues
of
travellers
and
awaken
the
flights
of
poets
shahpesh
smiled
and
said
site
is
good
i
laud
the
site
likewise
i
laud
the
wisdom
of
ebn
busrac
where
he
exclaims
be
sure
where
virtue
faileth
to
appear
for
her
a
gorgeous
mansion
men
will
rear
and
day
and
night
her
praises
will
be
heard
where
never
yet
she
spake
a
single
word
then
said
he
khipil
my
builder
there
was
once
a
farm
servant
that
having
neglected
in
the
to
sow
took
to
singing
the
richness
of
his
soil
when
it
was
harvest
in
proof
of
which
he
displayed
the
abundance
of
weeds
that
coloured
the
land
everywhere
discover
to
me
now
the
completeness
of
my
halls
and
apartments
i
pray
thee
o
khipil
and
be
the
excellence
of
thy
construction
made
visible
to
me
quoth
khipil
hear
is
to
obey
he
conducted
shahpesh
among
the
unfinished
saloons
and
imperfect
courts
and
roofless
rooms
and
by
half
erected
obelisks
and
columns
pierced
and
chipped
of
the
palace
of
his
building
and
he
was
bewildered
at
the
words
spoken
by
shahpesh
but
now
the
king
exalted
him
and
admired
the
perfection
of
his
craft
the
greatness
of
his
labour
the
speediness
of
his
construction
his
assiduity
feigning
not
to
behold
his
negligence
presently
they
went
up
winding
balusters
to
a
marble
terrace
and
the
king
said
is
thy
devotion
and
constancy
in
toil
khipil
that
thou
shaft
walk
before
me
here
he
then
commanded
khipil
to
precede
him
and
khipil
was
heightened
with
the
honour
when
khipil
had
paraded
a
short
space
he
stopped
quickly
and
said
to
shahpesh
is
as
it
chanceth
a
gap
o
king
and
we
can
go
no
further
this
way
shahpesh
said
is
perfect
and
it
is
my
will
thou
delay
not
to
advance
khipil
cried
gap
is
wide
o
mighty
king
and
manifest
and
it
is
an
incomplete
part
of
thy
palace
then
said
shahpesh
khipil
i
see
no
distinction
between
one
part
and
another
excellent
are
all
parts
in
beauty
and
proportion
and
there
can
be
no
part
incomplete
in
this
palace
that
occupieth
the
builder
four
years
in
its
building
so
advance
do
my
bidding
khipil
yet
hesitated
for
the
gap
was
of
many
strides
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
gap
was
a
deep
water
and
he
one
that
knew
not
the
motion
of
swimming
but
shahpesh
ordered
his
guard
to
point
their
arrows
in
the
direction
of
khipil
and
khipil
stepped
forward
hurriedly
and
fell
in
the
gap
and
was
swallowed
by
the
water
below
when
he
rose
the
second
time
succour
reached
him
and
he
was
drawn
to
land
trembling
his
teeth
chattering
and
shahpesh
praised
him
and
said
is
an
apt
contrivance
for
a
bath
khipil
o
my
builder
well
conceived
one
that
taketh
by
surprise
and
it
shall
be
thy
reward
daily
when
much
talking
hath
fatigued
thee
then
he
bade
khipil
lead
him
to
the
hall
of
state
and
when
they
were
there
shahpesh
said
a
privilege
and
as
a
mark
of
my
approbation
i
give
thee
permission
to
sit
in
the
marble
chair
of
yonder
throne
even
in
my
presence
o
khipil
khipil
said
o
king
the
chair
is
not
yet
executed
and
shahpesh
exclaimed
this
be
so
thou
art
but
the
length
of
thy
measure
on
the
ground
o
talkative
one
khipil
said
is
not
so
o
king
of
splendours
blind
that
i
am
yonder
indeed
the
chair
and
khipil
feared
the
king
and
went
to
the
place
where
the
chair
should
be
and
bent
his
body
in
a
sitting
posture
eyeing
the
king
and
made
pretence
to
sit
in
the
chair
of
shahpesh
as
in
conspiracy
to
amuse
his
master
then
said
shahpesh
a
token
that
i
approve
thy
execution
of
the
chair
thou
shalt
be
honoured
by
remaining
seated
in
it
up
to
the
hour
of
noon
but
move
thou
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
showing
thy
soul
insensible
of
the
honour
done
thee
transfixed
thou
shah
be
with
twenty
arrows
and
five
the
king
then
left
him
with
a
guard
of
of
his
and
they
stood
around
him
with
bent
bows
so
that
khipil
dared
not
move
from
his
sitting
posture
and
the
masons
and
the
people
crowded
to
see
khipil
sitting
on
his
master
chair
for
it
became
rumoured
about
when
they
beheld
him
sitting
upon
nothing
and
he
trembling
to
stir
for
fear
of
the
loosening
of
the
arrows
they
laughed
so
that
they
rolled
upon
the
floor
of
the
hall
and
the
echoes
of
laughter
were
a
surely
the
arrows
of
the
guards
swayed
with
the
laughter
that
shook
them
now
when
the
time
had
expired
for
his
sitting
in
the
chair
shahpesh
returned
to
him
and
he
was
cramped
pitiable
to
see
and
shahpesh
said
hast
been
exalted
above
men
o
khipil
for
that
thou
didst
execute
for
thy
master
has
been
found
fitting
for
thee
then
he
bade
khipil
lead
the
way
to
the
noble
gardens
of
dalliance
and
pleasure
that
he
had
planted
and
contrived
and
khipil
went
in
that
state
described
by
the
poet
when
we
go
draggingly
with
remonstrating
members
knowing
a
dreadful
strength
behind
and
a
dark
fate
before
they
came
to
the
gardens
and
behold
these
were
full
of
weeds
and
nettles
the
fountains
dry
no
tree
to
be
seen
a
desert
and
shahpesh
cried
is
indeed
of
admirable
design
o
khipil
feelest
thou
not
the
coolness
of
the
fountains
their
refreshingness
truly
i
am
grateful
to
thee
and
these
flowers
pluck
me
now
a
handful
and
tell
me
of
their
perfume
khipil
plucked
a
handful
of
the
nettles
that
were
there
in
the
place
of
flowers
and
put
his
nose
to
them
before
shahpesh
till
his
nose
was
reddened
and
desire
to
rub
it
waxed
in
him
and
possessed
him
and
became
a
passion
so
that
he
could
scarce
refrain
from
rubbing
it
even
in
the
king
presence
and
the
king
encouraged
him
to
sniff
and
enjoy
their
fragrance
repeating
the
poet
words
methinks
i
am
a
lover
and
a
child
a
little
child
and
happy
lover
both
when
by
the
breath
of
flowers
i
am
beguiled
from
sense
of
pain
and
lulled
in
odorous
sloth
so
i
adore
them
that
no
mistress
sweet
seems
worthier
of
the
love
which
they
awake
in
innocence
and
beauty
more
complete
was
never
maiden
cheek
in
morning
lake
oh
while
i
live
surround
me
with
fresh
flowers
oh
when
i
die
then
bury
me
in
their
bowers
and
the
king
said
sayest
thou
o
my
builder
that
is
a
fair
quotation
applicable
to
thy
feelings
one
that
expresseth
them
khipil
answered
eloquent
o
great
king
comprehensiveness
would
be
its
portion
but
that
it
alludeth
not
to
the
delight
of
chafing
then
shahpesh
laughed
and
cried
not
it
is
an
ill
thing
and
a
hideous
this
nosegay
o
khipil
it
is
for
thee
to
present
to
thy
mistress
truly
she
will
receive
thee
well
after
its
presentation
i
will
have
it
now
sent
in
thy
name
with
word
that
thou
followest
quickly
and
for
thy
nettled
nose
surely
if
the
whim
seize
thee
that
thou
desirest
its
chafing
to
thy
neighbour
is
permitted
what
to
thy
hand
is
refused
the
king
set
a
guard
upon
khipil
to
see
that
his
orders
were
executed
and
appointed
a
time
for
him
to
return
to
the
gardens
at
the
hour
indicated
khipil
stood
before
shahpesh
again
he
was
pale
saddened
his
tongue
drooped
like
the
tongue
of
a
heavy
bell
that
when
it
soundeth
giveth
forth
mournful
sounds
only
he
had
also
the
look
of
one
battered
with
many
beatings
so
the
king
said
of
the
presentation
of
the
flowers
of
thy
culture
o
khipil
he
answered
o
king
she
received
me
with
wrath
and
i
am
shamed
by
her
and
the
king
said
of
my
clemency
in
the
matter
of
the
chafing
khipil
answered
king
of
splendours
i
made
petition
to
my
neighbours
whom
i
met
accosting
them
civilly
and
with
imploring
for
i
ached
to
chafe
and
it
was
the
very
raging
thirst
of
desire
to
chafe
that
was
mine
devouring
eagerness
for
solace
of
chafing
and
they
chafed
me
o
king
yet
not
in
those
parts
which
throbbed
for
the
chafing
but
in
those
which
abhorred
it
then
shahpesh
smiled
and
said
certain
that
the
magnanimity
of
monarchs
is
as
the
rain
that
falleth
the
sun
that
shineth
and
in
this
spot
it
fertilizeth
richness
in
that
encourageth
rankness
so
art
thou
but
a
weed
o
khipil
and
my
grace
is
thy
chastisement
now
the
king
ceased
not
persecuting
khipil
under
pretence
of
doing
him
honour
and
heaping
favours
on
him
three
days
and
three
nights
was
khipil
gasping
without
water
compelled
to
drink
of
the
drought
of
the
fountain
as
an
honour
at
the
hands
of
the
king
and
he
was
seven
days
and
seven
nights
made
to
stand
with
stretched
arms
as
they
were
the
branches
of
a
tree
in
each
hand
a
pomegranate
and
shahpesh
brought
the
people
of
his
court
to
regard
the
wondrous
pomegranate
shoot
planted
by
khipil
very
wondrous
and
a
new
sort
worthy
the
gardens
of
a
king
so
the
wisdom
of
the
king
was
applauded
and
men
wotted
he
knew
how
to
punish
offences
in
coin
by
the
punishment
inflicted
on
khipil
the
builder
before
that
time
his
affairs
had
languished
and
the
currents
of
business
instead
of
flowing
had
become
stagnant
pools
it
was
the
fashion
to
do
as
did
khipil
and
fancy
the
tongue
a
constructor
rather
than
a
commentator
and
there
is
a
doom
upon
that
people
and
that
man
which
runneth
to
seed
in
gabble
as
the
poet
says
in
his
wisdom
if
thou
wouldst
be
famous
and
rich
in
splendid
fruits
leave
to
bloom
the
flower
of
things
and
dig
among
the
roots
truly
after
khipil
punishment
there
were
few
in
the
dominions
of
shahpesh
who
sought
to
win
the
honours
bestowed
by
him
on
gabblers
and
idlers
as
again
the
poet
when
to
loquacious
fools
with
patience
rare
i
listen
i
have
thoughts
of
khipil
chair
his
bath
his
nosegay
and
his
fount
i
see
himself
stretch
out
as
a
and
that
i
am
not
shahpesh
i
regret
so
to
inmesh
the
babbler
in
his
net
well
is
that
wisdom
worthy
to
be
sung
which
raised
the
palace
of
the
wagging
tongue
and
whoso
is
punished
after
the
fashion
of
shahpesh
the
persian
on
khipil
the
builder
is
said
to
be
one
the
palace
of
the
wagging
tongue
to
this
time
the
genie
karaz
now
when
the
voice
of
the
vizier
had
ceased
shibli
bagarag
exclaimed
vizier
this
night
no
later
i
surprise
shagpat
and
shave
him
while
he
sleepeth
and
he
shall
wake
shorn
beside
his
spouse
wullahy
i
delay
no
longer
i
shibli
bagarag
said
the
vizier
and
he
replied
o
vizier
thou
knowest
little
of
my
dexterity
so
the
vizier
laughed
and
noorna
bin
noorka
laughed
and
he
was
at
a
loss
to
interpret
the
cause
of
their
laughter
then
said
noorna
my
betrothed
there
not
a
doubt
among
us
of
thy
dexterity
nor
question
of
thy
willingness
but
this
shaving
of
shagpat
wullahy
is
longer
work
than
what
thou
makest
of
it
and
he
cried
because
of
the
chief
of
identicals
planted
by
thee
in
his
head
she
answered
of
that
but
is
the
smallest
opposer
that
then
the
vizier
said
us
consult
so
shibli
bagarag
gave
ear
and
the
vizier
continued
first
the
chief
of
identicals
planted
by
thee
in
the
head
of
that
presumptuous
fellow
o
my
daughter
by
what
means
shall
that
be
overcome
she
said
rank
not
that
first
o
feshnavat
my
father
surely
i
rank
first
the
illusions
with
which
rabesqurat
hath
surrounded
him
and
made
it
difficult
to
know
him
from
his
semblances
whenever
real
danger
threateneth
him
the
vizier
assented
saying
then
the
chief
of
identicals
she
answered
o
my
father
second
the
weakness
that
in
man
and
the
little
probability
of
his
finishing
with
shagpat
at
one
effort
and
there
is
but
a
sole
chance
for
whoso
attempteth
and
if
he
faileth
is
forever
he
faileth
so
the
vizier
said
i
knew
not
was
so
grave
third
then
the
chief
of
identicals
she
replied
which
showeth
the
difficulty
of
the
task
read
ye
not
first
how
the
barber
must
come
upon
shagpat
and
fix
him
for
his
operation
second
how
the
barber
must
be
possessed
of
more
than
mortal
strength
to
master
him
in
so
many
strokes
third
how
the
barber
must
have
a
blade
like
no
other
blade
in
this
world
in
sharpness
in
temper
in
velocity
of
sweep
that
he
may
reap
this
crop
which
flourisheth
on
shagpat
and
with
it
the
magic
hair
which
defieth
edge
of
mortal
blades
now
the
vizier
sighed
at
the
words
saying
is
shagpat
i
knew
not
the
thing
i
undertook
i
fear
his
mastery
of
us
and
we
shall
be
contemned
objects
for
the
red
finger
of
scorn
noorna
turned
to
shibli
bagarag
and
asked
the
three
bonds
of
enterprise
vengeance
ambition
and
love
shrink
in
thee
from
this
great
contest
shibli
bagarag
said
terrible
on
my
head
be
it
she
gazed
at
him
a
moment
tenderly
and
said
art
worthy
of
what
is
in
store
for
thee
o
my
betrothed
and
i
think
little
of
the
dangers
in
contemplation
of
the
courage
in
thee
lo
if
vengeance
and
ambition
spur
thee
so
how
will
not
love
when
added
to
the
two
then
said
she
to
the
enchantments
and
spells
that
shall
overreach
him
and
as
to
the
blade
wherewith
to
shear
him
feshnavat
exclaimed
indeed
where
we
stumble
and
are
tripped
at
starting
but
she
cried
if
i
know
of
a
sword
that
nought
on
earth
or
under
resisteth
and
before
the
keen
edge
of
which
all
illusions
and
identicals
are
as
summer
grass
to
the
scythe
they
both
shouted
whereabout
of
that
sword
o
noorna
so
she
said
in
aklis
in
the
mountains
of
the
koosh
and
the
seven
sons
of
aklis
sharpen
it
day
and
night
till
the
adventurer
cometh
to
claim
it
for
his
occasion
whoso
succeedeth
in
coming
to
them
they
know
to
have
power
over
the
sword
and
is
then
holiday
for
them
many
are
the
impediments
and
they
are
as
holes
where
the
fox
haunteth
so
they
deliver
to
his
hand
the
sword
till
his
object
is
attained
his
event
mastered
smitten
through
with
it
and
is
called
the
sword
of
events
surely
with
it
the
father
of
the
seven
vanquished
the
mighty
roc
kroojis
that
threatened
mankind
with
ruin
and
a
stain
of
the
blood
is
yet
on
the
hilt
of
the
sword
how
sayest
thou
o
feshnavat
shall
we
devote
ourselves
to
get
possession
of
that
sword
so
the
vizier
brightened
at
her
words
and
said
excellent
in
wisdom
and
star
of
counsel
speak
further
and
as
to
the
means
noorna
bin
noorka
continued
knowest
o
my
father
i
am
proficient
in
the
arts
of
magic
and
i
am
what
i
am
and
what
i
shall
be
by
its
uses
is
known
to
thee
also
that
i
hold
a
genie
in
bondage
and
can
utter
ten
spells
and
one
spell
in
a
breath
surely
my
services
to
the
youth
in
his
attainment
of
the
sword
will
be
beyond
price
now
to
reach
aklis
and
the
sword
there
are
three
things
needed
charms
and
one
is
a
phial
full
of
the
waters
of
paravid
from
the
wells
in
the
mountain
side
the
desert
and
one
certain
hairs
that
grow
in
the
tail
of
the
horse
garraveen
he
that
roameth
wild
in
the
meadows
of
melistan
and
one
that
the
youth
gather
and
bear
to
aklis
for
the
white
antelope
gulrevaz
the
lily
of
the
lovely
light
that
groweth
in
the
hollow
of
the
crags
over
the
enchanted
sea
with
these
spells
he
will
command
the
sword
of
aklis
and
nothing
can
bar
him
passage
moreover
i
will
expend
in
his
aid
all
my
subtleties
my
transformations
the
stores
of
my
wisdom
many
seek
this
sword
and
people
the
realms
of
rabesqurat
or
are
beasts
in
aklis
or
crowned
apes
or
go
to
feed
the
roc
kroojis
in
the
abyss
beneath
the
bridge
but
there
virtue
in
shibli
bagarag
wullahy
i
am
wistful
in
him
of
the
hand
of
destiny
and
he
will
succeed
in
this
undertaking
if
he
dareth
it
shibli
bagarag
cried
thy
bidding
o
noorna
care
i
for
dangers
i
on
fire
to
wield
the
sword
and
master
the
event
thereupon
noorna
bin
noorka
arose
instantly
and
took
him
by
the
cheeks
a
tender
pinch
and
praised
him
then
drew
she
round
him
a
circle
with
her
forefinger
that
left
a
mark
like
the
shimmering
of
evanescent
green
flame
saying
was
the
day
i
set
eyes
on
thee
round
the
vizier
her
father
she
drew
a
like
circle
and
she
took
an
unguent
and
traced
with
it
characters
on
the
two
circles
and
letters
of
strange
form
arrowy
like
leaning
sheaves
and
crouching
baboons
and
kicking
jackasses
and
cocks
and
lutes
and
she
knelt
and
mumbled
over
and
over
words
of
magic
like
the
drone
of
a
bee
to
hear
and
as
a
roll
of
water
nothing
distinguishable
after
that
she
sought
for
an
unguent
of
a
red
colour
and
smeared
it
on
a
part
of
the
floor
by
the
corner
of
the
room
and
wrote
on
it
in
silver
fluid
a
word
that
was
the
word
and
over
that
likewise
she
droned
awhile
presently
she
arose
with
a
face
the
sweat
on
her
brow
and
said
to
shibli
bagarag
and
feshnavat
hurriedly
and
in
a
harsh
tone
have
ye
fear
they
answered
faith
is
in
allah
our
confidence
in
thee
said
she
then
summon
the
genie
i
hold
in
bondage
he
will
be
wrathful
but
ye
are
secure
from
him
he
this
moment
in
the
farthest
region
of
earth
doing
ill
as
is
his
wont
and
the
wont
of
the
stock
of
eblis
so
the
vizier
said
be
no
true
helper
this
genie
and
i
care
not
for
his
company
she
answered
my
father
leave
thou
that
to
me
what
says
the
poet
it
is
the
sapiency
of
fools
to
shrink
from
handling
evil
tools
now
while
she
was
speaking
she
suddenly
inclined
her
ear
as
to
a
distant
noise
but
they
heard
nothing
then
after
again
listening
she
cried
in
a
sharp
voice
muffle
your
mouths
with
both
hands
and
stir
not
from
the
ring
of
the
circles
as
ye
value
life
and
its
blessings
so
they
did
as
she
bade
them
and
watched
her
curiously
lo
she
swathed
the
upper
and
lower
part
of
her
face
in
linen
leaving
the
lips
and
eyes
exposed
and
she
took
water
from
an
ewer
and
sprinkled
it
on
her
head
and
on
her
arms
and
her
feet
muttering
incantations
then
she
listened
a
third
time
and
stooped
to
the
floor
and
put
her
lips
to
it
and
called
the
name
and
she
called
this
name
seven
times
loudly
sneezing
between
whiles
then
as
it
were
in
answer
to
her
summons
there
was
a
deep
growl
of
thunder
and
the
palace
rocked
tottering
and
the
air
became
smoky
and
full
of
curling
vapours
presently
they
were
aware
of
the
cry
of
a
cat
and
its
miaulings
and
the
patch
of
red
unguent
on
the
floor
parted
and
they
beheld
a
tawny
cat
with
an
arched
back
so
noorna
bin
noorka
frowned
fiercely
at
the
cat
and
cried
is
thy
shape
o
karaz
change
for
it
serves
not
the
purpose
the
cat
changed
and
was
a
leopard
with
glowing
yellow
eyes
crouched
for
the
spring
so
noorna
bin
noorka
stamped
and
cried
again
is
thy
shape
o
karaz
change
for
it
serves
not
the
purpose
and
the
leopard
changed
and
was
a
serpent
with
many
folds
sleek
curled
venomous
hissing
noorna
bin
noorka
cried
in
wrath
is
thy
shape
o
karaz
change
or
be
no
other
till
eblis
is
accepted
in
paradise
and
the
serpent
vanished
lo
in
its
place
a
genie
of
terrible
aspect
black
as
a
solitary
tree
seared
by
lightning
his
forehead
ridged
and
cloven
with
red
streaks
his
hair
and
ears
reddened
his
eyes
like
two
hollow
pits
dug
by
the
shepherd
for
the
wolf
and
the
wolf
in
them
he
shouted
work
is
it
now
thou
accursed
traitress
noorna
replied
need
of
thee
he
said
shape
she
answered
shape
of
an
ass
that
will
carry
two
on
its
back
thou
perversity
upon
that
he
cried
faithless
woman
how
long
shall
i
be
the
slave
of
thy
plotting
now
but
for
that
hair
of
my
head
plucked
by
thy
hand
while
i
slept
i
were
free
no
doer
of
thy
tasks
say
who
be
these
that
mark
us
she
answered
the
vizier
feshnavat
and
one
shibli
bagarag
of
shiraz
he
that
destined
to
shave
shagpat
the
son
of
shimpoor
the
son
of
shoolpi
the
son
of
shullum
and
the
youth
is
my
betrothed
now
at
her
words
the
whole
genie
became
as
live
coal
with
anger
and
he
panted
black
and
bright
and
made
a
stride
toward
shibli
bagarag
and
stretched
his
arm
out
to
seize
him
but
noorna
blew
quickly
on
the
circles
she
had
drawn
and
the
circles
rose
up
in
a
white
flame
high
as
the
heads
of
those
present
and
the
genie
shrank
hastily
back
from
the
flame
and
was
seized
with
fits
of
sneezing
then
she
said
in
scorn
o
karaz
is
a
woman
outwitted
surely
i
could
not
guess
what
would
be
thy
action
and
i
was
wanting
in
foresight
and
insight
and
i
am
a
woman
bearing
the
weight
of
my
power
as
a
woodman
staggereth
under
the
logs
he
hath
felled
so
she
taunted
him
and
he
still
sneezing
and
bent
double
with
the
might
of
the
sneeze
then
said
noorna
in
a
stern
voice
more
altercation
between
us
wait
thou
here
till
i
reappear
karaz
thereupon
she
went
from
them
and
the
two
feshnavat
and
shibli
bagarag
feared
greatly
being
left
with
the
genie
for
he
became
all
colours
and
loured
on
them
each
time
that
he
ceased
sneezing
he
was
clearly
menacing
them
when
noorna
returned
and
in
her
hand
a
saddle
made
of
hide
traced
over
with
mystic
characters
and
gold
stripes
so
she
cried
this
then
seeing
he
hesitated
she
unclosed
from
her
left
palm
a
powder
and
scattered
it
over
him
and
he
grew
meek
and
the
bending
knee
of
obedience
was
his
and
he
took
the
saddle
so
she
said
well
go
now
and
wait
outside
the
city
in
the
shape
of
an
ass
with
this
saddle
on
thy
back
the
genie
groaned
and
said
hear
is
to
obey
and
he
departed
with
those
words
for
she
held
him
in
bondage
then
she
calmed
down
the
white
flames
of
the
circles
that
enclosed
shibli
bagarag
and
the
vizier
feshnavat
and
they
stepped
forth
marvelling
at
the
greatness
of
her
sorceries
that
held
such
a
genie
in
bondage
the
well
of
paravid
now
there
was
haste
in
the
movements
of
noorna
bin
noorka
and
she
arrayed
herself
and
clutched
shibli
bagarag
by
the
arm
and
the
twain
departed
from
feshnavat
the
vizier
and
came
to
the
outside
of
the
city
and
lo
there
was
the
genie
by
a
well
under
a
palm
and
he
standing
in
the
shape
of
an
ass
saddled
so
they
mounted
him
and
in
a
moment
they
were
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
and
naught
round
them
save
the
hot
glimmer
of
the
sands
and
the
grey
of
the
sky
surely
the
ass
went
at
such
a
pace
as
never
ass
went
before
in
this
world
resting
not
by
the
rivulets
nor
under
the
palms
nor
beside
the
it
was
as
if
the
ass
scurried
without
motion
of
his
legs
so
swiftly
went
he
at
last
the
desert
gave
signs
of
a
border
on
the
low
line
of
the
distance
and
this
grew
rapidly
higher
as
they
advanced
revealing
a
country
of
hills
and
rocks
and
at
the
base
of
these
the
ass
rested
so
noorna
said
desert
that
we
have
passed
o
my
betrothed
many
are
they
that
perish
in
it
and
reach
not
the
well
but
give
thanks
to
allah
that
it
is
passed
then
said
she
and
be
wary
of
moving
to
the
front
or
to
the
rear
of
this
ass
and
measure
thy
distance
from
the
lash
of
his
tail
so
shibli
bagarag
dismounted
and
followed
her
up
the
hills
and
the
rocks
through
ravines
and
gorges
of
the
rocks
and
by
tumbling
torrents
among
hanging
woods
over
perilous
precipices
where
no
sun
hath
pierced
and
the
bones
of
travellers
whiten
in
loneliness
and
they
continued
mounting
upward
by
winding
paths
now
closed
in
by
coverts
now
upon
open
heights
having
great
views
and
presently
a
mountain
was
disclosed
to
them
green
at
the
sides
high
up
it
and
noorna
bin
noorka
said
to
shibli
bagarag
here
for
the
cunning
of
this
ass
can
furnish
him
no
excuse
further
for
making
thee
food
for
the
birds
of
prey
so
shibli
bagarag
mounted
and
they
ceased
not
to
ascend
the
green
slopes
till
the
grass
became
scanty
and
darkness
fell
and
they
were
in
a
region
of
snow
and
cold
then
noorna
bin
noorka
tethered
the
ass
to
a
stump
of
a
tree
and
breathed
in
his
ear
and
the
ass
became
as
a
creature
carved
in
stone
and
she
drew
from
her
bosom
two
bags
of
silk
and
blew
in
one
and
entered
it
bidding
shibli
bagarag
do
likewise
with
the
other
bag
and
he
obeyed
her
drawing
it
up
to
his
neck
and
the
delightfulness
of
warmth
came
over
him
then
said
she
at
noon
we
shall
reach
near
the
summit
of
the
mountain
and
the
well
of
paravid
if
my
power
last
over
this
ass
and
from
that
time
thou
wilt
be
on
the
high
road
to
greatness
so
fail
not
to
remember
what
i
have
done
for
thee
and
be
not
guilty
of
ingratitude
when
thy
hand
is
the
stronger
he
promised
her
and
they
lay
and
slept
when
he
awoke
the
sun
was
risen
and
he
looked
at
noorna
bin
noorka
in
the
silken
bag
and
she
was
yet
in
the
peacefulness
of
pleasant
dreams
but
for
the
ass
surely
his
eyes
rolled
and
his
head
and
fore
legs
were
endued
with
life
while
his
latter
half
seemed
of
stone
and
the
youth
called
to
noorna
bin
noorka
and
pointed
to
her
the
strangeness
of
the
condition
of
the
ass
as
she
cast
eyes
on
him
she
cried
out
and
rushed
to
him
and
took
him
by
the
ears
and
blew
up
his
nostrils
and
the
animal
was
quiet
then
she
and
shibli
bagarag
mounted
him
again
and
she
said
to
him
is
well
thou
wert
more
vigilant
than
i
and
that
the
sun
rose
not
on
this
ass
while
i
slept
or
my
enchantment
would
have
thawed
on
him
and
he
would
have
us
she
gave
her
heel
to
the
ass
and
the
ass
hung
his
tail
in
sullenness
and
drooped
his
head
and
she
laughed
crying
silly
fellow
do
thy
work
willingly
and
take
wisely
thine
outwitting
she
jeered
him
as
they
journeyed
and
made
the
soul
of
shibli
bagarag
merry
so
that
he
jerked
in
his
seat
upon
the
ass
now
as
they
ascended
the
mountain
they
came
to
the
opening
of
a
cavern
and
noorna
bin
noorka
halted
the
ass
and
said
to
shibli
bagarag
part
here
and
i
wait
for
thee
in
this
place
take
this
phial
and
fill
it
with
the
waters
of
the
well
after
thy
bath
the
way
is
before
thee
speed
on
it
he
climbed
the
sides
of
the
mountain
and
was
soon
hidden
in
the
clefts
and
beyond
the
perches
of
the
vulture
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
rocky
point
when
he
disappeared
awaiting
his
return
and
the
sun
went
over
her
head
and
sank
on
the
of
the
mountain
and
it
was
by
the
beams
of
the
moon
that
she
beheld
shibli
bagarag
dropping
from
the
crags
and
ledges
of
rock
sliding
and
steadying
himself
downward
till
he
reached
her
with
the
phial
in
his
hand
filled
and
he
was
radiant
as
it
were
divine
with
freshness
so
that
noorna
before
she
spoke
welcome
to
him
was
lost
in
contemplating
the
warm
shine
of
his
visage
calling
to
mind
the
poet
words
the
wealth
of
light
in
sun
and
moon
all
nature
wealth
hath
mortal
beauty
for
a
boon
when
match
with
health
then
said
she
shibli
bagarag
is
achieved
this
first
of
thy
tasks
for
mutely
on
the
fresh
red
of
thy
mouth
my
betrothed
speaketh
the
honey
of
persuasiveness
and
the
children
of
aklis
will
not
resist
thee
so
she
took
the
phial
from
him
and
led
forth
the
ass
and
the
twain
mounted
the
ass
and
descended
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
in
moonlight
and
shibli
bagarag
said
i
have
marked
wonders
and
lived
a
life
since
our
parting
and
this
well
is
a
miracle
to
dip
in
it
and
by
it
sit
many
maidens
weeping
and
old
men
babbling
and
youths
that
were
idle
youths
striking
bubbles
from
the
surface
of
the
water
the
well
is
rounded
with
marble
and
the
sky
is
clear
in
it
cool
in
it
the
whole
earth
imaged
therein
then
noorna
said
thou
a
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
waters
of
the
well
he
answered
all
was
made
smooth
for
me
by
thy
aid
now
when
i
came
to
the
well
i
marked
not
them
by
it
but
plunged
and
the
depth
of
that
well
seemed
to
me
the
very
depth
of
the
earth
itself
so
went
i
ever
downward
and
when
i
was
near
the
bottom
of
the
well
i
had
forgotten
life
above
and
lo
no
sooner
had
i
touched
the
bottom
of
the
well
when
my
head
emerged
from
the
surface
was
wondrous
but
for
a
sign
that
touched
the
bottom
of
the
well
see
o
noorna
bin
noorka
the
jewel
the
one
of
myriads
that
glitter
at
the
bottom
and
i
plucked
it
for
a
gift
to
thee
so
noorna
took
the
jewel
from
his
hand
that
was
torn
and
crimson
and
she
cried
fair
youth
thou
bleedest
with
the
plucking
of
it
and
it
was
written
no
hand
shall
pluck
a
jewel
at
the
bottom
of
that
well
without
letting
of
blood
even
so
it
is
worthy
art
thou
and
i
was
not
mistaken
in
thee
at
her
words
shibli
bagarag
burst
forth
into
praises
of
her
and
he
sang
is
my
worthiness
match
with
thy
worth
darkness
and
earthiness
dust
and
dearth
o
noorna
thou
art
wise
above
women
great
and
glorious
over
them
in
this
fashion
the
youth
lauded
her
that
was
his
betrothed
but
she
exclaimed
or
the
jealousy
of
this
ass
will
be
aroused
and
of
a
surety
he
spill
us
then
he
laughed
and
she
laughed
till
the
tail
of
karaz
trembled
the
horse
garraveen
now
they
descended
leisurely
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
and
when
they
were
again
in
the
green
of
its
base
noorna
called
to
the
ass
karaz
sniff
now
the
breezes
for
the
end
of
our
journey
by
night
is
the
meadows
of
melistan
forward
in
thy
might
and
bray
not
when
we
are
in
them
for
thy
comfort
sake
the
ass
sniffed
turning
to
the
four
quarters
and
chose
a
certain
direction
and
bore
them
swiftly
over
hills
and
streans
eddying
in
silver
over
huge
mounds
of
sand
where
the
tents
of
bedouins
stood
in
white
clusters
over
lakes
smooth
as
the
cheeks
of
sleeping
loveliness
by
walls
of
cities
mosques
and
palaces
under
towers
that
rose
as
an
armed
man
with
the
steel
on
his
brows
and
the
frown
of
battle
by
the
shores
of
the
pale
foaming
sea
it
bore
them
going
at
a
pace
that
the
arab
on
his
steed
outstrippeth
not
so
when
the
sun
was
red
and
the
dews
were
blushing
with
new
light
they
struggled
from
a
wilderness
of
barren
broken
ground
and
saw
beneath
them
in
the
warm
beams
green
peaceful
deep
the
meadows
of
melistan
they
were
meadows
dancing
with
flowers
as
it
had
been
fresh
damsels
of
the
mountain
fair
with
variety
of
colours
that
were
so
many
gleams
of
changing
light
as
the
breezes
of
the
morn
swept
over
them
lavish
of
hues
of
sweetness
of
pleasantness
fir
for
the
souls
of
the
blest
then
after
they
had
gazed
awhile
noorna
bin
noorka
said
these
meadows
the
horse
garraveen
roameth
at
will
heroes
of
bliss
bestride
him
on
great
days
he
is
black
to
look
on
speed
quivers
in
his
flanks
like
the
lightning
his
nostrils
are
wide
with
flame
there
is
that
in
his
eye
which
is
settled
fire
and
that
in
his
hoofs
which
is
ready
thunder
when
he
paws
the
earth
kingdoms
quake
no
animal
liveth
with
blood
like
the
horse
garraveen
he
is
under
a
curse
for
that
he
bore
on
his
back
one
who
defied
the
prophet
now
to
make
him
come
to
thee
thou
must
blow
the
call
of
battle
and
to
catch
him
thou
must
contrive
to
strike
him
on
the
fetlock
as
he
runs
with
this
which
i
give
thee
and
to
tame
him
thou
must
trace
between
his
eyes
a
figure
or
the
crescent
with
thy
forenail
when
that
is
done
bring
him
to
me
here
where
i
await
thee
and
i
will
advise
thee
further
so
she
said
and
shibli
bagarag
showed
her
the
breadth
of
his
shoulders
and
stepped
briskly
toward
the
meadows
and
was
soon
brushing
among
the
flowers
and
soft
mosses
of
the
meadows
lifting
his
nostrils
to
the
joyful
smells
looking
about
him
with
the
broad
eye
of
one
that
hungereth
for
a
coming
thing
the
birds
went
up
above
him
and
the
trees
shook
and
sparkled
and
the
waters
of
brooks
and
broad
rivers
flashed
like
waving
mirrors
waved
by
the
in
sport
when
the
beauties
of
the
harem
riot
and
dip
their
gleaming
shoulders
in
the
bath
he
wandered
on
lost
in
the
gladness
that
lived
till
the
loud
neigh
of
a
steed
startled
him
and
by
the
banks
of
a
river
before
him
he
beheld
the
horse
garraveen
stooping
to
drink
of
the
river
glorious
was
the
look
of
the
creature
fashioned
in
the
curves
of
beauty
and
swiftness
so
shibli
bagarag
put
up
his
two
hands
and
blew
the
call
of
battle
and
the
horse
garraveen
arched
his
neck
at
the
call
and
swung
upon
his
haunches
and
sought
the
call
answering
it
and
tossing
his
mane
as
he
advanced
swiftly
then
as
he
neared
shibli
bagarag
held
the
in
his
fingers
and
aimed
at
the
fetlock
of
the
horse
garraveen
and
flung
it
and
struck
him
so
that
he
stumbled
and
fell
he
snorted
fiercely
as
he
bent
to
the
grass
but
shibli
bagarag
ran
to
him
and
grasped
strongly
the
tuft
of
hair
hanging
forward
between
his
ears
and
traced
between
his
fine
eyes
a
figure
of
the
crescent
with
his
forenail
and
the
horse
ceased
plunging
and
was
gentle
as
a
colt
by
its
mother
side
and
suffered
shibli
bagarag
to
bestride
him
and
spurn
him
with
his
heel
to
speed
and
bore
him
fleetly
across
the
fair
length
of
the
golden
meadows
to
where
noorna
bin
noorka
sat
awaiting
him
she
uttered
a
cry
of
welcome
saying
is
achieved
with
diligence
and
skill
o
my
betrothed
and
on
thy
right
wrist
i
mark
strength
like
a
sleeping
leopard
and
the
children
of
aklis
will
not
resist
thee
so
she
bade
him
alight
from
the
horse
but
he
said
and
she
called
to
him
again
to
alight
but
he
cried
will
not
alight
from
him
by
allah
such
a
bounding
wave
of
bliss
have
i
never
yet
had
beneath
me
and
i
will
give
him
rein
once
again
as
the
poet
says
divinely
rings
the
rushing
air
when
i
am
on
my
mettled
mare
when
fast
along
the
plains
we
fly
a
creature
of
the
heavens
am
i
then
she
levelled
her
brows
at
him
and
said
gravely
is
the
temptation
thou
art
falling
into
as
have
thousands
before
thy
time
give
him
the
rein
a
second
time
and
he
will
bear
thee
to
the
red
pit
and
halt
upon
the
brink
and
pitch
thee
into
it
among
bleeding
masses
and
skeletons
of
thy
kind
where
they
lie
who
were
men
like
to
thee
and
were
borne
away
by
the
horse
garraveen
he
gave
no
heed
to
her
words
taunting
her
and
making
the
animal
prance
up
and
prove
its
spirit
and
she
cried
reproachfully
fool
is
it
thus
our
great
aim
will
be
defeated
by
thy
silly
conceit
lo
now
the
greatness
and
the
happiness
thou
art
losing
for
this
idle
vanity
is
to
be
as
a
dunghill
cock
matched
with
an
ostrich
and
think
not
to
escape
the
calamities
thou
bringest
on
thyself
for
as
is
said
no
runner
can
outstrip
his
fate
and
it
will
overtake
thee
though
thou
part
like
an
arrow
from
the
bow
he
still
made
a
jest
of
her
remonstrance
trying
the
temper
of
the
animal
and
rejoicing
in
its
dark
flushes
of
ireful
vigour
and
she
cried
out
furiously
art
thou
past
counsel
then
will
we
match
strength
with
strength
ere
is
too
late
though
it
weaken
both
upon
that
she
turned
quickly
to
the
ass
and
stroked
it
from
one
extremity
to
the
other
crying
karaz
shouting
forth
in
thy
power
and
the
ass
vanished
and
the
genie
stood
in
his
place
tall
dark
terrible
as
a
pillar
of
storm
to
travellers
ranging
the
desert
he
exclaimed
is
it
o
woman
charge
me
with
thy
command
and
she
said
with
him
thou
seest
on
the
horse
garraveen
and
fling
him
from
his
seat
then
he
yelled
a
glad
yell
and
stooped
to
shibli
bagarag
on
the
horse
and
enveloped
him
and
seized
him
and
plucked
him
from
the
horse
and
whirled
him
round
and
flung
him
off
the
youth
went
circling
in
the
air
high
in
it
and
descended
circling
at
a
distance
in
the
deep
when
he
crept
up
the
banks
he
saw
the
genie
astride
the
horse
garraveen
with
a
black
flame
round
his
head
and
the
genie
urged
him
to
speed
and
put
him
to
the
gallop
and
was
soon
lost
to
sight
as
he
had
been
a
thunderbeam
passing
over
a
still
lake
at
midnight
and
shibli
bagarag
was
smitten
with
the
wrong
and
the
folly
of
his
act
and
sought
to
hide
his
sight
from
noorna
but
she
called
to
him
up
o
youth
and
face
the
calamity
lo
we
have
now
lost
the
service
of
karaz
for
though
i
utter
ten
spells
and
one
spell
in
a
breath
the
horse
garraveen
will
ere
that
have
stretched
beyond
the
circle
of
my
magic
and
the
genie
will
be
free
to
do
his
ill
deeds
and
plot
against
us
sad
is
it
but
profit
thou
by
a
knowledge
of
thy
weakness
then
said
she
i
have
not
failed
to
possess
myself
of
the
three
hairs
of
garraveen
and
there
is
that
to
rejoice
in
she
displayed
them
and
they
were
sapphire
hairs
and
had
a
flickering
light
and
they
seemed
to
live
wriggling
their
lengths
and
were
as
snakes
with
sapphire
skins
then
she
said
right
wrist
o
my
betrothed
he
gave
her
his
right
wrist
and
she
tied
round
it
the
three
hairs
of
garraveen
exclaiming
do
skilful
carpenters
make
stronger
what
has
broken
and
indicated
disaster
surely
i
confide
in
thy
star
i
have
faith
in
my
foresight
and
she
cried
of
mine
what
sayest
thou
to
me
lo
we
must
part
awhile
it
is
written
said
he
me
not
my
betrothed
what
am
i
without
thy
counsel
and
go
not
from
me
or
this
adventure
will
come
to
miserable
issue
so
she
said
beginnest
to
feel
my
worth
he
answered
noorna
was
woman
like
thee
before
in
this
world
surely
a
mask
i
mark
thee
under
yet
art
thou
perforce
of
sheer
wisdom
and
sweet
manners
lovely
in
my
sight
and
i
have
a
thirst
to
hear
thee
and
look
on
thee
while
he
spake
a
beam
of
struggling
splendour
burst
from
her
and
she
said
thou
dear
youth
yes
i
must
even
go
but
i
go
glad
of
heart
knowing
thee
prepared
to
love
me
i
must
go
to
counteract
the
machinations
of
karaz
for
he
at
once
busy
vindictive
and
cunning
and
there
no
time
for
us
to
lose
so
farewell
my
betrothed
and
make
thy
wits
keen
to
know
me
when
we
next
meet
so
he
said
i
whither
go
i
she
answered
the
city
of
oolb
straightway
then
he
i
know
not
its
bearing
from
this
spot
how
reach
it
she
answered
thou
with
the
phial
of
paravid
in
thy
vest
that
endoweth
a
single
drop
of
it
the
flowers
the
herbage
the
very
stones
and
desert
sands
with
a
tongue
to
articulate
intelligible
talk
said
he
it
so
she
answered
so
ere
slubli
bagarag
could
question
her
further
she
embraced
him
and
blew
upon
his
eyes
and
he
was
blinded
by
her
breath
and
saw
not
her
departure
groping
for
a
seat
on
the
rocks
and
thinking
her
still
by
him
sight
returned
not
to
him
till
long
after
weariness
had
brought
the
balm
of
sleep
upon
his
eyelids
the
talking
hawk
now
when
he
awoke
he
found
himself
alone
in
that
place
the
moon
shining
over
the
low
meadows
and
fair
with
odours
of
were
abroad
filling
the
cool
air
with
deliciousness
and
he
heard
in
the
gardens
below
songs
of
the
bulbul
it
was
like
a
dream
to
his
soul
and
he
lay
somewhile
contemplating
the
rich
loveliness
of
the
scene
that
showed
no
moving
thing
then
rose
he
and
bethought
him
of
the
words
of
noorna
and
of
the
city
of
oolb
and
the
phial
of
the
waters
of
paravid
in
his
vest
and
he
drew
it
forth
and
dropped
a
drop
of
it
on
the
rock
where
he
had
reclined
a
deep
harmony
seemed
suddenly
to
awake
inside
the
rock
and
to
his
interrogation
as
to
the
direction
of
oolb
he
heard
path
of
the
shadows
of
the
moon
thereupon
he
advanced
to
a
prominent
part
of
the
rocks
above
the
meadows
and
beheld
the
shadows
of
the
moon
thrown
forward
into
dimness
across
a
waste
of
sand
and
he
stepped
downward
to
the
level
of
sand
and
went
the
way
of
the
shadows
till
it
was
dawn
then
dropped
he
a
drop
of
the
waters
of
the
phial
on
a
spike
of
lavender
and
there
was
a
voice
said
to
him
in
reply
to
what
he
questioned
path
of
the
shadows
of
the
sun
the
shadows
of
the
sun
were
thrown
forward
across
the
same
waste
of
sand
and
he
turned
and
pursued
his
way
resting
at
noon
beneath
a
and
refreshing
himself
at
a
clear
spring
beside
it
surely
he
was
joyful
as
he
went
and
elated
with
high
prospects
singing
sun
and
moon
with
their
bright
fingers
point
the
hero
path
if
in
his
great
work
he
lingers
well
may
they
be
wroth
now
the
extent
of
the
duration
of
his
travel
was
four
days
and
an
equal
number
of
nights
and
it
was
on
the
fifth
morn
that
he
entered
the
gates
of
a
city
by
the
sea
even
at
that
hour
when
the
inhabitants
were
rising
from
sleep
fair
was
the
sea
beyond
it
and
the
harbour
was
crowded
with
vessels
ships
stored
with
merchandise
silks
dates
diamonds
damascus
steel
huge
bales
piled
on
the
decks
for
the
land
of
roum
and
other
lands
shibli
bagarag
thought
scarce
a
doubt
but
that
one
of
those
sails
will
set
for
oolb
shortly
wullahy
if
i
knew
which
board
her
and
win
a
berth
in
her
presently
he
thought
go
to
the
public
fountain
and
question
it
with
the
waters
thereupon
he
passed
down
the
streets
of
the
city
and
came
to
an
open
space
where
stood
the
fountain
and
sprinkled
it
with
paravid
and
the
fountain
spake
saying
men
are
question
not
dumb
things
cried
he
paravid
in
its
power
have
i
done
aught
to
baffle
myself
then
he
thought
nevertheless
well
to
do
as
the
fountain
directeth
and
question
men
while
i
see
them
and
he
walked
about
among
the
people
and
came
to
the
quays
of
the
harbour
where
the
ships
lay
close
in
many
of
them
an
easy
leap
from
shore
and
considered
whom
to
address
so
as
he
loitered
about
the
quays
meditating
on
the
means
at
the
disposal
of
the
and
marking
the
vessels
wistfully
behold
there
advanced
to
him
one
at
a
quick
pace
in
the
garb
of
a
sailor
he
observed
shibli
bagarag
attentively
a
moment
and
exclaimed
as
it
were
in
the
plenitude
of
respect
and
with
the
manner
of
one
that
is
abashed
thou
art
shibli
bagarag
the
nephew
of
the
barber
him
we
watch
for
so
shibli
bagarag
marvelled
at
this
recognition
and
answered
i
then
already
famous
to
that
extent
and
he
that
accosted
him
said
certain
the
trumpet
was
blown
before
thy
steps
and
there
is
not
a
man
in
this
city
but
knoweth
of
thy
destination
to
the
city
of
oolb
and
that
thou
art
upon
the
track
of
great
things
one
chosen
to
bring
about
imminent
changes
then
said
shibli
bagarag
this
i
praise
noorna
bin
noorka
daughter
of
feshnavat
vizier
of
the
king
that
ruleth
in
the
city
of
shagpat
she
saw
me
that
i
was
marked
for
greatness
wullahy
the
eagle
knoweth
me
from
afar
and
proclaimeth
me
the
antelope
of
the
hills
scenteth
the
coming
of
one
not
as
other
men
and
telleth
his
tidings
the
wind
of
the
desert
shapeth
its
gust
to
a
meaning
so
that
the
stranger
may
wot
shibli
bagarag
is
at
hand
he
puffed
his
chest
and
straightened
his
legs
like
the
cock
and
was
as
a
man
upon
whom
the
sultan
has
bestowed
a
dress
of
honour
even
as
the
plumed
peacock
then
the
other
said
that
i
am
captain
of
yonder
vessel
that
stands
farthest
out
from
the
harbour
with
her
sails
slackened
and
she
is
laden
with
figs
and
fruits
which
i
exchange
for
silks
spices
and
other
merchandise
with
the
people
of
oolb
now
what
says
the
poet
delay
in
thine
undertaking
is
disaster
of
thy
own
making
and
he
says
also
greatness
is
solely
for
them
that
succeed
is
a
rotten
applause
that
gives
earlier
meed
therefore
it
is
advisable
for
thee
to
follow
me
on
board
without
loss
of
time
and
we
will
sail
this
very
night
for
the
city
of
oolb
now
shibli
bagarag
was
ruled
by
the
words
of
the
captain
albeit
he
desired
to
stay
awhile
and
receive
the
homage
of
the
people
of
that
city
so
he
followed
him
into
a
boat
that
was
by
and
the
twain
were
rowed
by
sailors
to
the
ship
then
when
they
were
aboard
the
captain
set
sail
and
they
were
soon
in
the
hollows
of
deep
waters
there
was
a
berth
in
the
ship
set
apart
for
shibli
bagarag
and
one
for
the
captain
shibli
bagarag
when
he
entered
his
berth
beheld
at
the
head
of
his
couch
a
hawk
its
eyes
red
as
rubies
its
beak
sharp
as
the
curve
of
a
scimitar
so
he
called
out
to
the
captain
and
the
captain
came
to
him
but
when
he
saw
the
hawk
he
plucked
his
turban
from
his
head
and
dashed
it
at
the
hawk
and
afterward
ran
to
it
trying
to
catch
it
and
the
hawk
flitted
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
berth
he
after
it
with
open
arms
then
he
took
a
sword
but
the
hawk
flew
past
him
and
fixed
on
the
back
part
of
his
head
tearing
up
his
hair
by
the
talons
and
pecking
over
his
forehead
at
his
eyes
and
shibli
bagarag
heard
the
hawk
scream
the
name
and
he
looked
closely
at
the
captain
of
the
vessel
and
knew
him
for
the
genie
karaz
then
trembled
he
with
exceeding
terror
cursing
his
credulities
for
he
saw
himself
in
the
hands
of
the
genie
and
nothing
but
this
hawk
friendly
to
him
on
the
fearful
waters
when
the
hawk
had
torn
up
a
certain
hair
the
genie
stiffened
and
glowed
like
copper
in
the
furnace
the
whole
length
of
him
and
he
descended
heavily
through
the
bottom
of
the
ship
and
sank
into
the
waters
beneath
which
hissed
and
smoked
as
at
a
bar
of
heated
iron
then
shibli
bagarag
gave
thanks
to
the
prophet
and
praised
the
hawk
but
the
hawk
darted
out
of
the
cabin
and
he
followed
it
on
deck
and
lo
the
vessel
was
in
flames
and
the
hawk
in
a
circle
of
the
flames
and
the
flames
soared
with
it
and
left
it
no
outlet
now
as
shibli
bagarag
watched
the
hawk
the
flames
stretched
out
towards
him
and
took
hold
of
his
vestments
so
he
delayed
not
to
commend
his
soul
to
the
and
bore
witness
to
his
faith
and
plunged
into
the
sea
headlong
when
he
rose
the
ship
had
vanished
and
all
was
darkness
where
it
had
been
so
he
buffeted
with
the
billows
thinking
his
last
hour
had
come
and
there
was
no
help
for
him
in
this
world
and
the
spray
shaken
from
the
billows
blinded
him
the
great
walls
of
water
crumbled
over
him
strength
failed
him
and
his
memory
ceased
to
picture
images
of
the
old
time
his
heart
to
beat
with
ambition
and
to
keep
the
weight
of
his
head
above
the
surface
was
becoming
a
thing
worth
the
ransom
of
kings
as
he
was
sinking
and
turning
his
eyes
upward
he
heard
a
flutter
as
of
fledgling
wings
and
the
two
red
ruby
eyes
of
the
hawk
were
visible
above
him
like
steady
fires
in
the
gloom
and
the
hawk
perched
on
him
and
buried
itself
among
the
wet
hairs
of
his
head
and
presently
taking
the
identical
in
its
beak
the
hawk
lifted
him
half
out
of
water
and
bore
him
a
distance
and
dropped
him
this
the
hawk
did
many
times
and
at
the
last
shibli
bagarag
felt
land
beneath
him
and
could
wade
through
the
surges
to
the
shore
he
gave
thanks
to
the
supreme
disposer
kneeling
prostrate
on
the
shore
and
fell
into
a
sleep
deep
in
peacefulness
as
a
fathomless
well
unruffled
by
a
breath
now
when
it
was
dawn
shibli
bagarag
awoke
and
looked
inland
and
saw
plainly
the
minarets
of
a
city
shining
in
the
first
beams
and
the
front
of
yellow
mountains
and
people
moving
about
the
walls
and
on
the
towers
and
among
the
pastures
round
the
city
so
he
made
toward
them
and
inquired
of
them
the
name
of
their
city
and
they
stared
at
him
crying
thou
not
the
city
of
oolb
the
hawk
on
thy
shoulder
could
tell
thee
that
much
he
looked
and
saw
that
the
hawk
was
on
his
shoulder
and
its
left
wing
was
scorched
the
plumage
blackened
so
he
said
to
the
hawk
it
profitable
o
preserving
bird
to
ask
of
thee
questions
the
hawk
shook
its
wings
and
closed
an
eye
so
he
said
i
well
in
entering
this
city
the
hawk
shook
its
wings
again
and
closed
an
eye
so
he
said
what
house
shall
i
direct
my
steps
in
this
strange
city
for
the
attainment
of
the
purpose
i
have
the
hawk
flew
and
soared
and
alighted
on
the
topmost
of
the
towers
of
oolb
so
when
it
returned
he
said
bird
rare
bird
my
counsellor
it
is
an
indication
this
alighting
on
the
highest
tower
that
thou
advisest
me
to
go
straight
to
the
palace
of
the
king
the
hawk
flapped
its
wings
and
winked
both
eyes
so
shibli
bagarag
took
forth
the
phial
from
his
breast
remembering
the
virtues
of
the
waters
of
the
well
of
paravid
and
touched
his
lips
with
them
that
he
might
be
endowed
with
flowing
speech
before
the
king
of
oolb
as
he
did
this
the
phial
was
open
and
the
hawk
leaned
to
it
and
dipped
its
beak
into
the
water
and
he
entered
the
city
and
passed
through
the
long
streets
towards
the
palace
of
the
king
and
craved
audience
of
him
as
one
that
had
a
thing
marvellous
to
tell
so
the
king
commanded
that
shibli
bagarag
should
be
brought
before
him
for
he
was
a
lover
of
marvels
as
he
went
into
the
presence
of
the
king
shibli
bagarag
listened
to
the
hawk
for
the
hawk
spake
his
language
and
it
said
to
the
king
a
new
wonder
the
talking
hawk
so
when
he
had
bent
his
body
to
the
king
he
proclaimed
the
new
wonder
and
the
king
seemed
not
to
observe
the
hawk
and
said
what
city
art
thou
he
answered
o
king
to
shiraz
newly
from
the
city
of
shagpat
and
the
king
asked
is
it
with
that
hairy
wonder
he
answered
dark
forest
flourisheth
about
him
and
the
king
said
is
well
we
of
the
city
of
oolb
take
our
fashions
from
them
of
the
city
of
shagpat
and
it
is
but
yesterday
that
i
bastinadoed
a
barber
that
strayed
among
us
shibli
bagarag
sighed
when
he
heard
the
king
and
thought
to
himself
unfortunate
is
the
race
of
barbers
once
honourable
and
in
esteem
surely
it
will
not
be
otherwise
till
shagpat
is
shaved
and
the
king
called
out
to
him
for
the
cause
of
his
sighing
so
he
said
sigh
o
king
of
the
age
considering
how
like
may
be
the
case
of
the
barber
bastinadoed
but
yesterday
in
his
worth
and
value
to
that
of
roomdroom
the
reader
of
planets
that
was
a
barber
and
he
related
the
story
of
roomdroom
for
the
edification
of
the
king
and
the
exaltation
of
barbercraft
delivering
himself
neatly
and
winningly
and
pointedly
so
that
the
story
should
apply
which
was
its
merit
and
its
origin
goorelka
of
oolb
when
shibli
bagarag
had
finished
his
narration
of
the
case
of
roomdroom
the
barber
the
king
of
oolb
said
thou
native
of
shiraz
there
is
persuasion
and
sweetness
and
fascination
on
thy
tongue
and
i
am
touched
with
compassion
for
the
soles
of
baba
mustapha
that
i
bastinadoed
but
yesterday
and
he
was
from
shiraz
likewise
now
the
heart
of
shibli
bagarag
leapt
when
he
heard
mention
of
baba
mustapha
and
he
knew
him
for
his
uncle
that
was
searching
him
he
would
have
cried
aloud
his
relationship
but
the
hawk
whispered
in
his
ear
then
the
hawk
said
to
him
is
danger
in
the
king
muteness
respecting
me
for
i
am
visible
to
him
proclaim
the
spirit
of
prophecy
so
he
proclaimed
that
spirit
and
the
king
said
to
me
of
barbercraft
and
he
cried
king
of
the
age
the
barber
is
abased
trodden
underfoot
given
over
to
the
sneers
and
the
gibes
of
them
that
flatter
the
powerful
ones
he
is
as
the
winter
worm
as
the
crocodile
in
the
slime
of
his
sleep
by
the
bank
as
the
sick
eagle
before
moulting
but
i
say
o
king
that
he
will
come
forth
like
the
serpent
in
a
new
skin
shaming
the
old
one
he
slept
a
caterpillar
and
will
come
forth
a
butterfly
he
sank
a
star
and
lo
he
riseth
a
constellation
now
while
he
was
speaking
in
the
fervour
of
his
soul
the
king
said
something
to
one
of
the
court
officers
surrounding
him
and
there
was
brought
to
the
king
a
basin
a
and
barber
tackle
when
shibli
bagarag
saw
these
the
uses
of
the
barber
rushed
upon
his
mind
and
desire
to
sway
the
tackle
pushed
him
forward
and
agitated
him
so
that
he
could
not
keep
his
hands
from
them
then
the
king
exclaimed
is
as
i
thought
our
passions
betray
themselves
and
our
habits
so
is
it
written
by
allah
i
swear
thou
art
thyself
none
other
than
a
barber
o
youth
shibli
bagwrag
was
nigh
fainting
with
terror
at
this
discovery
of
the
king
but
the
hawk
said
in
his
ear
speech
in
the
tackle
so
he
proclaimed
speech
in
the
tackle
and
the
king
smiled
doubtfully
and
said
this
be
a
cheat
shiraz
will
not
see
thy
face
more
then
the
hawk
whispered
in
his
ear
on
the
tackle
secretly
a
drop
from
the
phial
this
he
did
spreading
his
garments
and
commanded
the
tackle
to
speak
and
the
tackle
spake
each
portion
of
it
confusedly
as
the
noise
of
babel
so
the
king
marvelled
greatly
and
said
a
greater
wonder
than
the
talking
hawk
the
talking
tackle
wullahy
it
ennobleth
barbercraft
yet
it
were
well
to
comprehend
the
saying
of
the
tackle
then
the
hawk
flew
to
the
tackle
and
fluttered
about
it
and
lo
the
blade
and
the
brush
stood
up
and
said
in
a
shrill
tone
is
ordained
that
shagpat
shall
be
shaved
and
that
shibli
bagarag
shall
shave
him
the
king
bit
the
forefinger
of
amazement
and
said
then
ensueth
o
talking
tackle
and
the
brush
and
the
blade
stood
up
and
said
in
a
shrill
tone
to
shibli
bagarag
and
barbers
shame
unto
shagpat
and
his
fellows
upon
that
the
king
cried
o
talking
tackle
i
will
forestall
the
coming
thing
i
will
be
shaved
wullahy
that
will
i
then
the
hawk
whispered
to
shibli
bagarag
and
shear
him
so
he
stepped
forth
and
seized
the
tackle
and
addressed
himself
keenly
to
the
shaving
of
the
king
of
oolb
lathering
him
and
performing
his
task
with
perfect
skill
and
the
courtiers
crowded
to
follow
the
example
of
the
king
and
shibli
bagarag
shaved
them
all
of
them
now
when
they
were
shaved
fear
smote
them
the
fear
of
ridicule
and
each
laughed
at
the
change
that
was
in
the
other
but
the
king
cried
that
order
is
issued
for
the
people
of
oolb
to
be
as
we
before
sun
so
is
laughter
taken
in
reverse
and
the
king
said
aside
to
shibli
bagarag
now
what
may
be
thy
price
for
yonder
hawk
and
the
hawk
bade
him
say
loan
of
thy
cockleshell
the
king
mused
and
said
is
much
to
ask
for
it
is
that
which
beareth
the
princess
my
daughter
to
the
lily
of
the
enchanted
sea
which
she
nourisheth
and
if
is
harmed
she
will
be
stricken
with
ugliness
as
was
the
daughter
of
the
vizier
feshnavat
who
tended
it
before
her
yet
is
this
hawk
a
bird
of
price
what
be
its
qualities
besides
the
gift
of
speech
shibli
bagarag
answered
counsel
in
extremity
to
forewarn
to
counteract
enchantments
and
foul
magic
upon
that
the
king
said
me
and
the
king
led
the
way
from
the
hall
through
many
spacious
chambers
fair
with
mirrors
and
silks
and
precious
woods
and
smooth
marble
floors
down
into
a
vault
lit
by
a
lamp
that
was
shaped
like
an
eye
round
the
vault
were
hung
and
swords
and
housings
and
there
were
silken
dresses
and
costly
shawls
and
tall
vases
and
jars
of
china
tapestries
and
gold
services
and
the
king
said
thy
choice
of
these
in
exchange
for
the
hawk
but
shibli
bagarag
said
save
a
loan
of
the
king
then
the
king
threatened
him
saying
is
a
virtue
in
each
of
the
things
thou
seest
the
china
jar
is
brimmed
with
wine
and
remaineth
so
though
a
thousand
drink
of
it
the
dress
of
samarcand
rendereth
the
wearer
invisible
yet
thou
refusest
to
exchange
them
for
thy
hawk
and
the
king
swore
by
the
beard
of
his
father
he
would
seize
perforce
the
hawk
and
shut
up
shibli
bagarag
in
the
vault
if
he
fell
not
into
his
bargain
shibli
bagarag
was
advised
by
the
hawk
to
accept
the
china
jar
and
the
dress
of
samarcand
and
handed
the
hawk
to
the
king
in
exchange
for
these
things
so
the
king
took
the
hawk
upon
his
wrist
and
departed
with
it
to
the
apartments
of
his
daughter
and
shibli
bagarag
went
to
the
chamber
prepared
for
him
in
the
palace
now
when
it
was
night
shibli
bagarag
heard
a
noise
at
his
lattice
and
he
arose
and
peered
through
it
and
lo
the
hawk
was
fluttering
without
so
he
let
it
in
and
caressed
it
and
the
hawk
bade
him
put
on
his
silken
dress
and
carry
forth
his
china
jar
and
go
the
round
of
the
palace
and
offer
drink
to
the
sentinels
and
the
slaves
so
he
did
as
the
hawk
directed
and
the
sentinels
and
slaves
were
aware
of
a
china
jar
brimmed
with
wine
that
was
lifted
to
their
lips
but
him
that
lifted
it
they
saw
not
surely
they
drank
deep
of
the
draught
of
astonishment
then
the
hawk
flew
before
him
and
he
followed
it
to
a
chamber
lit
with
golden
lamps
gorgeously
hung
and
full
of
a
dusky
splendour
and
the
faint
sparkle
of
gems
ruby
amethyst
topaz
and
beryl
in
it
there
was
the
hush
of
sleep
and
the
heart
of
shibli
bagarag
told
him
that
one
beautiful
was
near
so
he
approached
on
tiptoe
a
couch
of
blue
silk
bordered
with
and
inwoven
with
stars
of
blue
turquoise
stones
as
it
had
been
the
heavens
of
midnight
on
the
couch
lay
one
a
woman
pure
in
loveliness
the
dark
fringes
of
her
closed
lids
like
living
flashes
of
darkness
her
mouth
like
an
unstrung
bow
and
as
a
double
rosebud
even
as
two
isles
of
coral
between
which
in
the
clear
transparent
watery
beds
the
pearls
shine
freshly
and
the
hawk
said
to
shibli
bagarag
is
the
princess
goorelka
the
daughter
of
the
king
of
oolb
a
sorceress
the
guardian
of
the
lily
of
the
enchanted
sea
beneath
her
pillow
is
the
grasp
it
but
gaze
not
upon
her
he
approached
and
slid
his
arm
beneath
the
pillow
of
the
princess
and
grasped
the
but
ere
he
drew
it
forth
he
gazed
upon
her
and
the
lustre
of
her
countenance
transfixed
him
as
with
a
javelin
so
that
he
could
not
stir
nor
move
his
eyes
from
the
contemplation
of
her
sweetness
of
feature
the
hawk
darted
at
him
fiercely
and
pecked
at
him
to
draw
his
attention
from
her
and
he
stepped
back
yet
he
continued
taking
fatal
draughts
from
the
magic
cup
of
her
beauty
then
the
hawk
screamed
a
loud
scream
of
anguish
and
the
princess
awoke
and
started
from
the
couch
and
stared
about
her
and
saw
the
bird
in
agitation
as
she
looked
at
the
bird
a
shudder
passed
over
her
and
she
snatched
a
veil
and
drew
it
over
her
face
murmuring
dream
or
i
am
under
the
eye
of
a
man
then
she
felt
beneath
the
pillow
and
knew
that
the
had
been
touched
and
in
a
moment
she
leapt
from
her
couch
and
ran
to
a
mirror
and
saw
herself
as
she
was
a
made
to
snare
the
wariest
and
sit
singly
high
on
a
throne
in
the
hearts
of
men
at
the
sight
of
her
beauty
she
smiled
and
seemed
at
peace
murmuring
still
am
under
the
eye
of
a
man
or
i
dream
now
while
she
so
murmured
she
arrayed
herself
and
took
the
and
passed
through
the
among
her
women
sleeping
and
shibli
bagarag
tracked
her
till
she
came
to
the
vault
and
she
entered
it
and
walked
to
the
corner
from
which
had
hung
the
dress
of
samarcand
when
she
saw
it
gone
her
face
waxed
pale
and
she
gazed
slowly
at
all
points
muttering
is
no
further
doubt
but
that
i
am
under
the
eye
of
a
man
thereupon
she
ran
hastily
from
the
vault
and
passed
between
the
sentinels
of
the
palace
and
saw
them
where
they
lay
drowsy
with
intoxication
so
she
knew
that
the
china
jar
and
the
dress
of
samarcand
had
been
used
that
night
and
for
no
purpose
friendly
to
her
wishes
then
she
passed
down
the
palace
steps
and
through
the
gates
of
the
palace
and
the
city
till
she
came
to
the
shore
of
the
sea
there
she
launched
the
and
took
the
wind
in
her
garments
and
sat
in
it
filling
it
to
overflowing
yet
it
floated
and
shibli
bagarag
waded
to
the
and
took
hold
of
it
and
was
drawn
along
by
its
motion
swiftly
through
the
waters
so
that
a
foam
swept
after
him
and
goorelka
marked
the
foam
now
they
had
passage
over
the
billows
smoothly
and
soon
the
length
of
the
sea
was
darkened
with
two
high
rocks
and
between
them
there
was
a
narrow
channel
of
the
sea
roughened
with
moonlight
so
they
sped
between
the
rocks
and
came
upon
a
purple
sea
overhead
with
large
stars
leaning
to
the
waves
there
was
a
soft
whisperingness
in
the
breath
of
the
breezes
that
swung
there
and
many
sails
of
charmed
ships
were
seen
in
momentary
gleams
flapping
the
mast
idly
far
away
warm
as
new
milk
from
the
full
udders
were
the
waters
of
that
sea
and
figures
of
fair
women
stretched
lengthwise
with
the
current
and
lifted
a
head
as
they
rushed
rolling
by
truly
it
was
enchanted
even
to
the
very
bed
