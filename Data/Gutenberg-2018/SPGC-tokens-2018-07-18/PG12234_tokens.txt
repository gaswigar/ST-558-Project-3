part
i
chapter
scarborough
it
will
be
necessary
for
the
purpose
of
my
story
that
i
shall
go
back
more
than
once
from
the
point
at
which
it
begins
so
that
i
may
explain
with
the
least
amount
of
awkwardness
the
things
as
they
occurred
which
led
up
to
the
incidents
that
i
am
about
to
tell
and
i
may
as
well
say
that
these
first
four
chapters
of
the
book
though
they
may
be
thought
to
be
the
most
interesting
of
them
all
by
those
who
look
to
incidents
for
their
interest
in
a
tale
are
in
this
way
only
preliminary
the
world
has
not
yet
forgotten
the
intensity
of
the
feeling
which
existed
when
old
scarborough
declared
that
his
eldest
son
was
not
legitimate
scarborough
himself
had
not
been
well
known
in
early
life
he
had
been
the
only
son
of
a
squire
in
staffordshire
over
whose
grounds
a
town
had
been
built
and
established
in
this
way
a
property
which
had
not
originally
been
extensive
had
been
greatly
increased
in
value
and
scarborough
when
he
came
into
possession
had
found
himself
to
be
a
rich
man
he
had
then
gone
abroad
and
had
there
married
an
english
lady
after
the
lapse
of
some
years
he
had
returned
to
tretton
park
as
his
place
was
named
and
there
had
lost
his
wife
he
had
come
back
with
two
sons
mountjoy
and
augustus
and
there
at
tretton
he
had
lived
spending
however
a
considerable
portion
of
each
year
in
chambers
in
the
albany
he
was
a
man
who
through
many
years
had
had
his
own
circle
of
friends
but
as
i
have
said
before
he
was
not
much
known
in
the
world
he
was
luxurious
and
and
altogether
indifferent
to
the
opinion
of
those
around
him
but
he
was
affectionate
to
his
children
and
anxious
above
all
things
for
their
welfare
or
rather
happiness
some
marvellous
stories
were
told
as
to
his
income
which
arose
chiefly
from
the
tretton
and
from
the
town
of
tretton
which
had
been
built
chiefly
on
his
very
park
in
consequence
of
the
nature
of
the
clay
and
the
quality
of
the
water
as
a
fact
the
original
four
thousand
a
year
to
which
his
father
had
been
born
had
grown
to
twenty
thousand
by
nature
of
the
operations
which
had
taken
place
but
the
whole
of
this
whether
four
thousand
or
twenty
thousand
was
strictly
entailed
and
scarborough
had
been
very
anxious
since
his
second
son
was
born
to
create
for
him
also
something
which
might
amount
to
opulence
but
they
who
knew
him
best
knew
that
of
all
things
he
hated
most
the
entail
the
boys
were
both
educated
at
eton
and
the
elder
went
into
the
guards
having
been
allowed
an
intermediate
year
in
order
to
learn
languages
on
the
continent
he
had
then
become
a
cornet
in
the
coldstreams
and
had
from
that
time
lived
a
life
of
reckless
expenditure
his
brother
augustus
had
in
the
mean
time
gone
to
cambridge
and
become
a
barrister
he
had
been
called
but
two
years
when
the
story
was
made
known
of
his
father
singular
assertion
as
from
that
time
it
became
unnecessary
for
him
to
practise
his
profession
no
more
was
heard
of
him
as
a
lawyer
but
they
who
had
known
the
young
man
in
the
chambers
of
that
great
luminary
rugby
declared
that
a
very
eminent
advocate
was
now
spoiled
by
a
freak
of
fortune
of
his
brother
mountjoy
or
captain
scarborough
as
he
came
to
be
known
at
an
early
period
of
his
life
the
stories
which
were
told
in
the
world
at
large
were
much
too
remarkable
to
be
altogether
true
but
it
was
only
too
true
that
he
lived
as
though
the
wealth
at
his
command
were
without
limit
for
some
few
years
his
father
bore
with
him
patiently
doubling
his
allowance
and
paying
his
bills
for
him
again
and
again
he
made
up
his
mind
with
many
regrets
that
enough
had
been
done
for
his
younger
son
who
would
surely
by
his
intellect
be
able
to
do
much
for
himself
but
then
it
became
necessary
to
encroach
on
the
funds
already
put
by
and
at
last
there
came
the
final
blow
when
he
discovered
that
captain
scarborough
had
raised
large
sums
on
from
the
jews
the
jews
simply
requested
the
father
to
pay
the
money
or
some
portion
of
it
which
if
at
once
paid
would
satisfy
them
explaining
to
him
that
otherwise
the
whole
property
would
at
his
death
fall
into
their
hands
it
need
not
here
be
explained
how
through
one
sad
year
these
negotiations
were
prolonged
but
at
last
there
came
a
time
in
which
scarborough
sitting
in
his
chambers
in
the
albany
boldly
declared
his
purpose
he
sent
for
his
own
lawyer
grey
and
greatly
astonished
that
gentleman
by
declaring
to
him
that
captain
scarborough
was
illegitimate
at
first
grey
refused
altogether
to
believe
the
assertion
made
to
him
he
had
been
very
conversant
with
the
affairs
of
the
family
and
had
even
dealt
with
marriage
settlements
on
behalf
of
the
lady
in
question
he
knew
scarborough
well
or
rather
had
not
known
him
but
had
heard
much
of
him
and
therefore
suspected
him
grey
was
a
thoroughly
respectable
man
and
scarborough
though
upright
and
honorable
in
many
dealings
had
not
been
thoroughly
respectable
he
had
lived
with
his
wife
off
and
on
as
people
say
though
he
had
saved
much
of
his
money
for
the
purpose
above
described
he
had
also
spent
much
of
it
in
a
manner
which
did
not
approve
itself
to
grey
grey
had
thoroughly
disliked
the
eldest
son
and
had
in
fact
been
afraid
of
him
the
captain
in
the
few
interviews
that
had
been
necessary
between
them
had
attempted
to
domineer
over
the
lawyer
till
there
had
at
last
sprung
up
a
quarrel
in
which
to
tell
the
truth
the
father
took
the
part
of
the
son
grey
had
for
a
while
been
so
offended
as
to
find
it
necessary
to
desire
scarborough
to
employ
another
lawyer
he
had
not
however
done
so
and
the
breach
had
never
become
absolute
in
these
circumstances
scarborough
had
sent
for
grey
to
come
to
him
at
the
albany
and
had
there
from
his
bed
declared
that
his
eldest
son
was
illegitimate
grey
had
at
first
refused
to
accept
the
assertion
as
being
worth
anything
and
had
by
no
means
confined
himself
to
polite
language
in
expressing
his
belief
i
would
much
rather
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
he
had
said
when
scarborough
insisted
on
the
truth
of
his
statement
but
the
evidence
is
all
here
said
scarborough
laying
his
hand
on
a
small
bundle
of
papers
the
difficulty
would
have
been
and
the
danger
in
causing
mountjoy
to
have
been
accepted
in
his
place
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
i
was
not
married
till
after
mountjoy
was
born
grey
curiosity
was
roused
and
he
began
to
ask
questions
why
in
the
first
place
had
scarborough
behaved
so
dishonestly
why
had
he
originally
not
married
his
wife
and
then
why
had
he
married
her
if
as
he
said
the
proofs
were
so
easy
how
had
he
dared
to
act
so
directly
in
opposition
to
the
laws
of
his
country
why
indeed
had
he
been
through
the
whole
of
his
life
so
bad
a
man
so
bad
to
the
woman
who
had
borne
his
name
so
bad
to
the
son
whom
he
called
illegitimate
and
so
bad
also
to
the
other
son
whom
he
now
intended
to
restore
to
his
position
solely
with
the
view
of
defrauding
the
captain
creditors
in
answer
to
this
scarborough
though
he
was
suffering
much
at
the
time
so
much
as
to
be
considered
near
to
his
death
had
replied
with
the
most
perfect
he
had
done
very
well
he
thought
by
his
wife
whom
he
had
married
after
she
had
consented
to
live
with
him
on
other
terms
he
had
done
very
well
by
his
elder
son
for
whom
he
had
intended
the
entire
property
he
had
done
well
by
his
second
son
for
whom
he
had
saved
his
money
it
was
now
his
first
duty
to
save
the
property
he
regarded
himself
as
being
altogether
unselfish
and
virtuous
from
his
point
of
view
when
grey
had
spoken
about
the
laws
of
his
country
he
had
simply
smiled
though
he
was
expecting
a
grievous
operation
on
the
following
day
as
for
marriage
he
had
no
great
respect
for
it
except
as
a
mode
of
enabling
men
and
women
to
live
together
comfortably
as
for
the
outraged
laws
of
his
country
of
which
grey
spoke
much
he
did
not
care
a
straw
for
such
outrages
nor
indeed
for
the
expressed
opinion
of
mankind
as
to
his
conduct
he
was
very
soon
about
to
leave
the
world
and
meant
to
do
the
best
he
could
for
his
son
augustus
the
other
son
was
past
all
hope
he
was
hardly
angry
with
his
eldest
son
who
had
undoubtedly
given
him
cause
for
just
anger
his
apparent
motives
in
telling
the
truth
about
him
at
last
were
rather
those
of
defrauding
the
jews
who
had
expressed
themselves
to
him
with
brutal
audacity
than
that
of
punishing
the
one
son
or
doing
justice
to
the
other
but
even
of
them
he
spoke
with
a
cynical
triumphing
in
his
idea
of
thoroughly
getting
the
better
of
them
i
am
consoled
grey
he
said
when
i
think
how
probably
it
might
all
have
been
discovered
after
my
death
i
should
have
destroyed
all
these
and
he
laid
his
hands
upon
the
papers
but
still
there
might
have
been
discovery
grey
could
not
but
think
that
during
the
last
years
the
period
which
had
elapsed
since
the
birth
of
the
younger
son
no
idea
of
such
a
truth
had
occurred
to
himself
he
did
at
last
consent
to
take
the
papers
in
his
hands
and
to
read
them
through
with
care
he
took
them
away
with
that
promise
and
with
an
assurance
that
he
would
bring
them
back
on
the
day
but
one
following
should
scarborough
then
be
alive
scarborough
who
seemed
at
that
moment
to
have
much
life
in
him
insisted
on
this
proviso
the
surgeon
is
to
be
here
you
know
and
his
coming
may
mean
a
great
deal
you
will
have
the
papers
which
are
quite
clear
and
will
know
what
to
do
i
shall
see
mountjoy
myself
this
evening
i
suppose
he
will
have
the
grace
to
come
as
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
coming
for
then
the
father
smiled
again
and
the
lawyer
went
scarborough
though
he
was
very
strong
of
heart
did
have
some
misgivings
as
the
time
came
at
which
he
was
to
see
his
son
the
communication
which
he
had
to
make
was
certainly
one
of
vital
importance
his
son
had
some
time
since
instigated
him
to
come
to
terms
with
the
family
creditors
as
the
captain
boldly
called
them
seeing
that
i
never
owed
a
shilling
in
my
life
or
my
father
before
me
it
is
odd
that
i
should
have
family
creditors
the
father
had
answered
the
property
has
then
at
any
rate
the
son
had
said
with
a
scowl
but
that
was
now
twelve
months
since
before
mankind
and
the
jews
among
them
had
heard
of
scarborough
illness
now
there
could
be
no
question
of
dealing
on
favorable
terms
with
these
gentlemen
scarborough
was
therefore
aware
that
the
evil
thing
which
he
was
about
to
say
to
his
son
would
have
lost
its
extreme
bitterness
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
in
making
such
a
revelation
as
to
his
son
mother
he
would
inflict
any
great
grief
on
his
son
heart
to
be
illegitimate
would
be
he
thought
nothing
unless
illegitimacy
carried
with
it
loss
of
property
he
hardly
gave
weight
enough
to
the
feeling
that
the
eldest
son
was
the
eldest
son
and
too
little
to
the
triumph
which
was
present
to
his
own
mind
in
saving
the
property
for
one
of
the
family
augustus
was
but
the
captain
brother
but
he
was
the
old
squire
son
the
two
brothers
had
hitherto
lived
together
on
fairly
good
terms
for
the
younger
had
been
able
to
lend
money
to
the
elder
and
the
elder
had
found
his
brother
neither
severe
or
exacting
how
it
might
be
between
them
when
their
relations
with
each
other
should
be
altogether
changed
scarborough
did
not
trouble
himself
to
inquire
the
captain
by
his
own
reckless
folly
had
lost
his
money
had
lost
all
that
fortune
would
have
given
him
as
his
father
eldest
son
after
having
done
so
what
could
it
matter
to
him
whether
he
were
legitimate
or
illegitimate
his
brother
as
possessor
of
tretton
park
would
be
able
to
do
much
more
for
him
than
could
be
expected
from
a
professional
man
working
for
his
bread
scarborough
had
looked
at
the
matter
all
round
for
the
space
of
two
years
and
during
the
latter
year
had
slowly
resolved
on
his
line
of
action
he
had
had
no
scruple
in
passing
off
his
as
legitimate
and
now
would
have
none
in
declaring
the
truth
to
the
world
what
scruple
need
he
have
seeing
that
he
was
so
soon
about
to
leave
the
world
as
to
what
took
place
at
that
interview
between
the
father
and
the
son
very
much
was
said
among
the
clubs
and
in
societies
to
which
captain
mountjoy
scarborough
was
well
known
but
very
little
of
absolute
truth
was
ever
revealed
it
was
known
that
captain
scarborough
left
the
room
under
the
combined
authority
of
apothecaries
and
servants
and
that
the
old
man
had
fainted
from
the
effects
of
the
interview
he
had
undoubtedly
told
the
son
of
the
simple
facts
as
he
had
declared
them
to
grey
but
had
thought
it
to
be
unnecessary
to
confirm
his
statement
by
any
proof
indeed
the
proofs
such
as
they
were
the
written
testimony
that
is
were
at
that
moment
in
the
hands
of
grey
and
to
grey
the
father
had
at
last
referred
the
son
but
the
son
had
absolutely
refused
to
believe
for
a
moment
in
the
story
and
had
declared
that
his
father
and
grey
had
conspired
together
to
rob
him
of
his
inheritance
and
good
name
the
interview
was
at
last
over
and
scarborough
at
one
moment
fainting
and
in
the
next
suffering
the
extremest
agony
was
left
alone
with
his
thoughts
captain
scarborough
when
he
left
his
father
rooms
and
found
himself
going
out
from
the
albany
into
piccadilly
was
an
infuriated
but
at
the
same
time
a
most
wretched
man
he
did
believe
that
a
conspiracy
had
been
hatched
and
he
was
resolved
to
do
his
best
to
defeat
it
let
the
effect
be
what
it
might
on
the
property
but
yet
there
was
a
strong
feeling
in
his
breast
that
the
fraud
would
be
successful
no
man
could
possibly
be
environed
by
worse
circumstances
as
to
his
own
condition
he
owed
he
knew
not
what
amount
of
money
to
several
creditors
but
then
he
owed
which
troubled
him
more
gambling
debts
which
he
could
only
pay
by
his
brother
assistance
and
now
as
he
thought
of
it
he
felt
convinced
that
his
brother
must
be
joined
with
his
father
and
the
lawyer
in
this
conspiracy
he
felt
also
that
he
could
meet
neither
grey
nor
his
brother
without
personally
attacking
them
all
the
world
might
perish
but
he
with
his
last
breath
would
declare
himself
to
be
captain
mountjoy
scarborough
of
tretton
park
and
though
he
knew
at
the
moment
that
he
must
perish
as
regarded
social
life
among
his
comrades
unless
he
could
raise
five
hundred
pounds
from
his
brother
yet
he
felt
that
were
he
to
meet
his
brother
he
could
not
but
fly
at
his
throat
and
accuse
him
of
the
basest
villany
at
that
moment
at
the
corner
of
bond
street
he
did
meet
his
brother
what
is
this
said
he
fiercely
what
is
what
said
augustus
without
any
fierceness
what
is
up
now
i
have
just
come
from
my
father
and
how
is
the
governor
if
i
were
he
i
should
be
in
a
most
awful
funk
i
should
hardly
be
able
to
think
of
anything
but
that
man
who
is
to
come
with
his
knives
but
he
takes
it
all
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
there
was
something
in
this
which
at
once
shook
though
it
did
not
remove
the
captain
belief
and
he
said
something
as
to
the
property
then
there
came
questions
and
answers
in
which
the
captain
did
not
reveal
the
story
which
had
been
told
to
him
but
the
barrister
did
assert
that
he
had
as
yet
heard
nothing
as
to
anything
of
importance
as
to
tretton
the
captain
believed
his
brother
manner
rather
than
his
words
in
fact
the
barrister
had
heard
nothing
as
yet
of
what
was
to
be
done
on
his
behalf
the
interview
ended
in
the
two
men
going
and
dining
at
a
club
where
the
captain
told
the
whole
story
of
his
father
imagined
iniquity
augustus
received
the
tale
almost
in
silence
in
reply
to
his
authoritative
domineering
speeches
he
said
nothing
to
him
it
was
all
new
but
to
him
also
it
seemed
certainly
to
be
untrue
he
did
not
at
all
bring
himself
to
believe
that
grey
was
in
the
conspiracy
but
he
had
no
scruple
of
paternal
regard
to
make
him
feel
that
this
father
would
not
concoct
such
a
scheme
simply
because
he
was
his
father
it
would
be
a
saving
of
the
spoil
from
the
amalekites
and
of
this
idea
he
did
give
a
hint
to
his
brother
by
george
said
the
captain
nothing
of
the
kind
shall
be
done
with
my
consent
why
no
the
barrister
had
answered
i
suppose
that
neither
your
consent
nor
mine
is
to
be
asked
and
it
seems
as
though
it
were
a
farce
ordered
to
be
played
over
the
poor
governor
grave
he
has
prepared
a
romance
as
to
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
which
neither
you
nor
i
can
possibly
be
called
as
witnesses
it
was
clear
to
the
captain
that
his
brother
had
thought
that
the
plot
had
been
prepared
by
their
father
in
anticipation
of
his
own
death
nevertheless
by
the
younger
brother
assistance
the
sum
of
money
was
found
for
the
supply
of
the
elder
immediate
wants
the
next
day
was
the
day
of
terror
and
nothing
more
was
heard
either
then
or
for
the
following
week
of
the
old
gentleman
scheme
in
two
days
it
was
understood
that
his
death
might
be
hourly
expected
but
on
the
third
it
was
thought
that
he
might
pull
through
as
his
younger
son
filially
expressed
himself
he
was
constantly
with
his
father
but
not
a
word
passed
his
lips
as
to
the
property
the
elder
son
kept
himself
gloomily
apart
and
indeed
during
a
part
of
the
next
week
was
out
of
london
augustus
scarborough
did
call
on
grey
but
only
learned
from
him
that
it
was
at
any
rate
true
that
the
story
had
been
told
by
his
father
grey
refused
to
make
any
farther
communication
simply
saying
that
he
would
as
yet
express
no
opinion
for
myself
said
augustus
as
he
left
the
attorney
chambers
i
can
only
profess
myself
so
much
astonished
as
to
have
no
opinion
i
suppose
i
must
simply
wait
and
see
what
fortune
intends
to
do
with
me
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
scarborough
had
so
far
recovered
his
strength
as
to
be
able
to
be
moved
down
to
tretton
and
thither
he
went
it
was
not
many
days
after
that
the
world
was
first
informed
that
captain
scarborough
was
not
his
father
heir
the
world
received
the
information
with
a
great
deal
of
expressed
surprise
and
inward
satisfaction
satisfaction
that
the
should
be
done
out
of
their
money
that
a
professed
gambler
like
captain
scarborough
should
suddenly
become
an
illegitimate
nobody
and
more
interesting
still
that
a
very
wealthy
and
if
not
actually
respectable
squire
should
have
proved
himself
to
be
a
most
rascal
all
of
these
were
matters
which
gave
extreme
delight
to
the
world
at
large
at
first
there
came
little
paragraphs
without
any
name
and
then
some
hours
afterward
the
names
became
known
to
the
quidnuncs
and
in
a
short
space
of
time
were
in
possession
of
the
very
gentry
who
found
themselves
defrauded
in
this
singular
manner
it
is
not
necessary
here
that
i
should
recapitulate
all
the
circumstances
of
the
original
fraud
for
a
gross
fraud
had
been
perpetrated
after
the
perpetration
of
that
fraud
papers
had
been
prepared
by
scarborough
himself
with
a
great
deal
of
ingenuity
and
the
matter
had
been
so
arranged
that
but
for
his
own
declaration
his
eldest
son
would
undoubtedly
have
inherited
the
property
now
there
was
no
measure
to
the
clamor
and
the
uproar
raised
by
the
grey
outer
office
was
besieged
but
his
clerk
simply
stated
that
the
facts
would
be
proved
on
scarborough
death
as
clearly
as
it
might
be
possible
to
prove
them
the
curses
uttered
against
the
old
squire
were
bitter
and
deep
but
during
this
time
he
was
still
supposed
to
be
lying
at
death
door
and
did
not
in
truth
himself
expect
to
live
many
days
the
creditors
of
course
believed
that
the
story
was
a
fiction
none
of
them
were
enabled
to
see
captain
scarborough
who
after
a
short
period
disappeared
altogether
from
the
scene
but
they
were
one
and
all
convinced
that
the
matter
had
been
arranged
between
him
and
his
father
there
was
one
from
whom
better
things
were
expected
than
to
advance
money
on
to
a
gambler
at
a
rate
by
which
he
was
to
be
repaid
one
hundred
pounds
for
every
forty
pounds
on
the
death
of
a
gentleman
who
was
then
supposed
to
be
dying
for
it
was
proved
afterward
that
this
tyrrwhit
had
made
most
minute
inquiries
among
the
old
servants
as
to
the
state
of
their
master
health
he
had
supplied
forty
thousand
pounds
for
which
he
was
to
receive
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
when
the
squire
died
alleging
that
he
should
have
difficulty
in
recovering
the
money
but
he
had
collected
the
sum
so
advanced
on
better
terms
among
his
friends
and
had
become
conspicuously
odious
in
the
matter
in
about
a
month
time
it
was
generally
believed
that
scarborough
had
so
managed
matters
that
his
scheme
would
be
successful
a
struggle
was
made
to
bring
the
matter
at
once
into
the
law
courts
but
the
attempt
for
the
moment
failed
it
was
said
that
the
squire
down
at
tretton
was
too
ill
but
that
proceedings
would
be
taken
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
bear
them
rumors
were
afloat
that
he
would
be
taken
into
custody
and
it
was
even
asserted
that
two
policemen
were
in
the
house
at
tretton
but
it
was
soon
known
that
no
policemen
were
there
and
that
the
squire
was
free
to
go
whither
he
would
or
rather
whither
he
could
in
fact
though
the
will
to
punish
him
and
even
to
arrest
him
was
there
no
one
had
the
power
to
do
him
an
injury
it
was
then
declared
that
he
had
in
no
sense
broken
the
law
that
no
evil
act
of
his
could
be
proved
that
though
he
had
wished
his
eldest
son
to
inherit
the
property
wrongfully
he
had
only
wished
it
and
that
he
had
now
simply
put
his
wishes
into
unison
with
the
law
and
had
undone
the
evil
which
he
had
hitherto
only
contemplated
indeed
the
world
at
large
rather
sympathized
with
the
squire
when
dealings
became
known
for
it
was
supposed
by
many
that
tyrrwhit
was
to
have
become
the
sole
owner
of
tretton
but
the
creditors
were
still
loud
and
still
envenomed
they
and
their
emissaries
hung
about
tretton
and
demanded
to
know
where
was
the
captain
of
the
captain
whereabouts
his
father
knew
nothing
not
even
whether
he
was
still
alive
for
the
captain
had
actually
disappeared
from
the
world
and
his
creditors
could
obtain
no
tidings
respecting
him
at
this
period
and
for
long
afterward
they
imagined
that
he
and
his
father
were
in
league
together
and
were
determined
to
try
at
law
the
question
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
his
birth
as
soon
as
the
old
squire
should
be
dead
but
the
old
squire
did
not
die
though
his
life
was
supposed
to
be
most
precarious
he
still
continued
to
live
and
became
even
stronger
but
he
remained
shut
up
at
tretton
and
utterly
refused
to
see
any
emissary
of
any
creditor
to
give
tyrrwhit
his
due
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
he
personally
sent
no
emissaries
having
contented
himself
with
putting
the
business
into
the
hands
of
a
very
sharp
attorney
but
there
were
emissaries
from
others
who
after
a
while
were
excluded
altogether
from
the
park
here
scarborough
continued
to
live
coming
out
on
to
the
lawn
in
his
and
there
smoking
his
cigar
and
reading
his
french
novel
through
the
hot
july
days
to
tell
the
truth
he
cared
very
little
for
the
emissaries
excepting
so
far
as
they
had
been
allowed
to
interfere
with
his
own
personal
comfort
in
these
days
he
had
down
with
him
two
or
three
friends
from
london
who
were
good
enough
to
make
up
for
him
a
in
the
country
but
he
found
the
chief
interest
in
his
life
in
the
occasional
visits
of
his
younger
son
i
look
upon
mountjoy
as
utterly
gone
he
said
but
he
has
utterly
gone
his
other
son
replied
as
to
that
i
care
nothing
i
do
not
believe
that
a
man
can
be
murdered
without
leaving
a
trace
of
his
murder
a
man
can
not
even
throw
himself
overboard
without
being
missed
i
know
nothing
of
his
whereabouts
nothing
at
all
but
i
must
say
that
his
absence
is
a
relief
to
me
the
only
comfort
left
to
me
in
this
world
is
in
your
presence
and
in
those
material
good
things
which
i
am
still
able
to
enjoy
this
assertion
as
to
his
ignorance
about
his
eldest
son
the
squire
repeated
again
and
again
to
his
chosen
heir
feeling
it
was
only
probable
that
augustus
might
participate
in
the
belief
which
he
knew
to
be
only
too
common
there
was
no
doubt
an
idea
prevalent
that
the
squire
and
the
captain
were
in
league
together
to
cheat
the
creditors
and
that
the
squire
who
in
these
days
received
much
undeserved
credit
for
machiavellian
astuteness
knew
more
than
any
one
else
respecting
his
eldest
son
affairs
but
in
truth
he
at
first
knew
nothing
and
in
making
these
assurances
to
his
younger
son
was
altogether
wasting
his
breath
for
his
younger
son
knew
everything
chapter
ii
florence
mountjoy
scarborough
had
a
niece
one
florence
mountjoy
to
whom
it
had
been
intended
that
captain
scarborough
should
be
married
there
had
been
no
considerations
of
money
when
the
intention
had
been
first
formed
for
the
lady
was
possessed
of
no
more
than
ten
thousand
pounds
which
would
have
been
as
nothing
to
the
prospects
of
the
captain
when
the
idea
was
first
entertained
but
scarborough
was
fond
of
people
who
belonged
to
him
in
this
way
he
had
been
much
attached
to
his
late
general
mountjoy
and
had
perceived
that
his
niece
was
beautiful
and
graceful
and
was
in
every
way
desirable
as
one
who
might
be
made
in
part
thus
to
belong
to
himself
florence
herself
when
the
idea
of
the
marriage
was
first
suggested
to
her
by
her
mother
was
only
eighteen
and
received
it
with
awe
rather
than
with
pleasure
or
abhorrence
to
her
her
cousin
mountjoy
had
always
been
a
most
magnificent
personage
he
was
only
seven
years
her
senior
but
he
had
early
in
life
assumed
the
manners
as
he
had
also
done
the
vices
of
mature
age
and
loomed
large
in
the
girl
eyes
as
a
man
of
undoubted
wealth
and
fashion
at
that
period
three
years
antecedent
to
his
father
declaration
he
had
no
doubt
been
much
in
debt
but
his
debts
had
not
been
generally
known
and
his
father
had
still
thought
that
a
marriage
with
his
cousin
might
serve
to
settle
him
to
use
the
phrase
which
was
common
with
himself
from
that
day
to
this
the
courtship
had
gone
on
and
the
squire
had
taught
himself
to
believe
that
the
two
cousins
were
all
but
engaged
to
each
other
he
had
so
considered
it
at
any
rate
for
two
years
till
during
the
last
final
year
he
had
resolved
to
throw
the
captain
overboard
and
even
during
this
year
there
had
been
periods
of
hope
for
he
had
not
finally
made
up
his
mind
till
but
a
short
time
before
he
had
put
it
in
practice
no
doubt
he
was
fond
of
his
niece
in
accordance
with
his
own
capability
for
fondness
he
would
caress
her
and
stroke
her
hair
and
took
delight
in
having
her
near
to
him
and
of
true
love
for
such
a
girl
his
heart
was
quite
capable
he
was
a
fearless
but
not
a
selfish
man
to
whom
the
fate
in
life
of
this
poor
girl
was
a
matter
of
real
concern
and
his
eldest
son
who
was
by
no
means
had
something
of
the
same
nature
he
did
love
truly
after
his
own
fashion
of
loving
he
would
have
married
his
cousin
at
any
moment
with
or
without
her
ten
thousand
pounds
for
of
all
human
beings
he
was
the
most
reckless
and
yet
in
his
breast
was
present
a
feeling
of
honor
of
which
his
father
knew
nothing
when
it
was
explained
to
him
that
his
mother
fair
name
was
to
be
aspersed
a
mother
whom
he
could
but
faintly
remember
the
threat
did
bring
with
it
its
own
peculiar
agony
but
of
this
the
squire
neither
felt
or
knew
anything
the
lady
had
long
been
dead
and
could
be
none
the
better
or
the
worse
for
aught
that
could
be
said
of
her
to
the
captain
it
was
not
so
and
it
was
preferable
to
him
to
believe
his
father
to
be
dishonest
than
his
mother
he
at
any
rate
was
in
truth
in
love
with
his
cousin
florence
and
when
the
story
was
told
to
him
one
of
its
first
effects
was
the
bearing
which
it
would
have
upon
her
mind
it
has
been
said
that
within
two
or
three
days
after
the
communication
he
had
left
london
he
had
done
so
in
order
that
he
might
at
once
go
down
to
cheltenham
and
see
his
cousin
there
miss
mountjoy
lived
with
her
mother
the
time
had
been
when
florence
mountjoy
had
been
proud
of
her
cousin
and
to
tell
the
truth
of
her
feelings
though
she
had
never
loved
him
she
had
almost
done
so
rumors
had
made
their
way
through
even
to
her
condition
of
life
and
she
in
her
innocence
had
gradually
been
taught
to
believe
that
captain
scarborough
was
not
a
man
whom
she
could
be
safe
in
loving
and
there
had
perhaps
come
another
as
to
whom
her
feelings
were
different
she
had
no
doubt
at
first
thought
that
she
would
be
willing
to
become
her
cousin
wife
but
she
had
never
said
as
much
herself
and
now
both
her
heart
and
mind
were
set
against
him
captain
scarborough
as
he
went
down
to
cheltenham
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
thinking
within
himself
how
best
he
might
carry
out
his
project
his
intention
was
to
obtain
from
his
cousin
an
assurance
of
her
love
and
a
promise
that
it
should
not
be
shaken
by
any
stories
which
his
father
might
tell
respecting
him
for
this
purpose
he
he
must
make
known
to
her
the
story
his
father
had
told
him
and
his
own
absolute
disbelief
in
it
much
else
must
be
confided
to
her
he
must
acknowledge
in
part
his
own
debts
and
must
explain
that
his
father
had
taken
this
course
in
order
to
defraud
the
creditors
all
this
would
be
very
difficult
but
he
must
trust
in
her
innocence
and
generosity
he
thought
that
the
condition
of
his
affairs
might
be
so
represented
that
the
story
should
tend
rather
to
win
her
heart
toward
him
than
to
turn
it
away
her
mother
had
hitherto
always
been
in
his
favor
and
he
had
in
fact
been
received
almost
as
an
apollo
in
the
house
at
cheltenham
florence
he
said
i
must
see
you
alone
for
a
few
minutes
i
know
that
your
mother
will
trust
you
with
me
this
was
spoken
immediately
on
his
arrival
and
mountjoy
at
once
left
the
room
she
had
been
taught
to
believe
that
it
was
her
daughter
duty
to
marry
her
cousin
and
though
she
knew
that
the
captain
had
done
much
to
embarrass
the
property
she
thought
that
this
would
be
the
surest
way
to
settle
him
the
heir
of
tretton
park
was
in
her
estimation
so
great
a
man
that
very
much
was
to
be
endured
at
his
hands
the
meeting
between
the
two
cousins
was
very
long
and
when
mountjoy
at
last
returned
unannounced
to
the
room
she
found
her
daughter
in
tears
oh
florence
what
is
the
matter
asked
her
mother
the
poor
girl
said
nothing
but
still
continued
to
weep
while
the
captain
stood
by
looking
as
black
as
a
what
is
it
mountjoy
said
mountjoy
turning
to
him
i
have
told
florence
some
of
my
troubles
said
he
and
they
seemed
to
have
changed
her
mind
toward
me
there
was
something
in
this
which
was
detestable
to
florence
an
unfairness
a
dishonesty
in
putting
off
upon
his
trouble
that
absence
of
love
which
she
had
at
last
been
driven
by
his
vows
to
confess
she
knew
that
it
was
not
because
of
his
present
trouble
which
she
understood
to
be
terrible
but
which
she
could
not
in
truth
comprehend
he
had
blurted
it
all
out
roughly
the
story
as
told
by
his
father
of
his
dishonor
of
his
own
insignificance
in
the
world
of
the
threatened
loss
of
the
property
of
the
heaviness
of
his
debts
and
added
his
conviction
that
his
father
had
invented
it
all
and
was
in
fact
a
thorough
rascal
the
full
story
of
his
debts
he
kept
back
not
with
any
predetermined
falseness
but
because
it
is
so
difficult
for
a
man
to
own
that
he
has
absolutely
ruined
himself
by
his
own
folly
it
was
not
wonderful
that
the
girl
should
not
have
understood
such
a
story
as
had
then
been
told
her
why
was
he
defending
his
mother
why
was
he
accusing
his
father
the
accusations
against
her
uncle
whom
she
did
know
were
more
fearful
to
her
than
these
mysterious
charges
against
her
aunt
whom
she
did
not
know
from
which
her
son
defended
her
but
then
he
had
spoken
passionately
of
his
own
love
and
she
had
understood
that
he
had
besought
her
to
confess
that
she
loved
him
and
then
she
had
at
once
become
stubborn
there
was
something
in
the
word
confess
which
grated
against
her
feelings
it
seemed
to
imply
a
conviction
on
his
part
that
she
did
love
him
she
had
never
told
him
so
and
was
now
sure
that
it
was
not
so
when
he
had
pressed
her
she
could
only
weep
but
in
her
weeping
she
never
for
a
moment
yielded
she
never
uttered
a
single
word
on
which
he
could
be
enabled
to
build
a
hope
then
he
had
become
blacker
and
still
blacker
fiercer
and
still
fiercer
more
and
more
earnest
in
his
purpose
till
at
last
he
asked
her
whom
it
was
that
she
loved
as
she
could
not
love
him
he
knew
well
whom
it
was
that
he
suspected
and
she
knew
also
but
he
had
no
right
to
demand
any
statement
from
her
on
that
head
she
did
not
think
that
the
man
loved
her
nor
did
she
know
what
to
say
or
to
think
of
her
own
feelings
were
he
the
other
man
to
come
to
her
she
would
only
bid
him
go
away
but
why
she
should
so
bid
him
she
had
hardly
known
but
now
this
dark
frowning
captain
with
his
big
mustache
and
his
military
look
and
his
general
aspect
of
invincible
power
threatened
the
other
man
he
came
to
tretton
as
my
friend
he
said
and
by
heaven
if
he
stands
in
my
way
if
he
dare
to
cross
between
you
and
me
he
shall
answer
it
with
his
life
the
name
had
not
been
mentioned
but
this
had
been
very
terrible
to
florence
and
she
could
only
weep
he
went
away
refusing
to
stay
to
dinner
but
said
that
on
the
following
afternoon
he
would
again
return
in
the
street
of
the
town
he
met
one
of
his
creditors
who
had
discovered
his
journey
to
cheltenham
and
had
followed
him
oh
captain
mountjoy
what
is
all
dis
that
they
are
talking
about
in
london
what
are
they
talking
about
de
inheritance
said
the
man
who
was
a
veritable
jew
looking
up
anxiously
in
his
face
the
man
had
his
acceptance
for
a
very
large
sum
of
money
with
an
assurance
that
it
should
be
paid
on
his
father
death
for
which
he
had
given
him
about
two
thousand
pounds
in
cash
you
must
ask
my
father
but
is
it
true
you
must
ask
my
father
upon
my
word
i
can
tell
you
nothing
else
he
has
concocted
a
tale
of
which
i
for
one
do
not
believe
a
word
i
never
heard
of
the
story
till
he
condescended
to
tell
it
me
the
other
day
whether
it
be
true
or
whether
it
be
false
you
and
i
hart
are
in
the
same
boat
but
you
have
had
de
money
and
you
have
got
the
bill
you
ca
do
anything
by
coming
after
me
my
father
seems
to
have
contrived
a
very
clever
plan
by
which
he
can
rob
you
but
he
will
rob
me
at
the
same
time
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
please
but
that
you
will
find
to
be
the
truth
then
hart
left
him
but
certainly
did
not
believe
a
word
the
captain
had
said
to
him
to
her
mother
florence
would
only
disclose
her
persistent
intention
of
not
marrying
her
cousin
mountjoy
over
whose
spirit
the
glamour
of
the
captain
prestige
was
still
potent
said
much
in
his
favor
everybody
had
always
intended
the
marriage
and
it
would
be
the
setting
right
of
everything
the
captain
no
doubt
owed
a
large
sum
of
money
but
that
would
be
paid
by
florence
fortune
so
little
did
the
poor
lady
know
of
the
captain
condition
when
she
had
been
told
that
there
had
been
a
great
quarrel
between
the
captain
and
his
father
she
declared
that
the
marriage
would
set
that
all
right
but
mamma
captain
scarborough
is
not
to
have
the
property
at
all
then
mountjoy
believing
thoroughly
in
entails
had
declared
that
all
heaven
could
not
prevent
it
but
that
makes
no
difference
said
the
daughter
if
i
i
i
loved
him
i
would
marry
him
so
much
the
more
if
he
had
nothing
then
mountjoy
declared
that
she
could
not
understand
it
at
all
on
the
next
day
captain
scarborough
came
according
to
his
promise
but
nothing
that
he
could
say
would
induce
florence
to
come
into
his
presence
her
mother
declared
that
she
was
so
ill
that
it
would
be
wicked
to
disturb
her
chapter
iii
harry
annesley
together
with
augustus
scarborough
at
cambridge
had
been
one
harry
annesley
and
he
it
was
to
whom
the
captain
in
his
wrath
had
sworn
to
put
an
end
if
he
should
come
between
him
and
his
love
harry
annesley
had
been
introduced
to
the
captain
by
his
brother
and
an
intimacy
had
grown
up
between
them
he
had
brought
him
to
tretton
park
when
florence
was
there
and
harry
had
since
made
his
own
way
to
cheltenham
and
had
endeavored
to
plead
his
own
cause
after
his
own
fashion
this
he
had
done
after
the
good
old
english
plan
which
is
said
to
be
somewhat
loutish
but
is
not
without
its
efficacy
he
had
looked
at
her
and
danced
with
her
and
done
the
best
with
his
gloves
and
his
cravat
and
had
let
her
see
by
twenty
unmistakable
signs
that
in
order
to
be
perfectly
happy
he
must
be
near
her
her
gloves
and
her
flowers
and
her
other
little
properties
were
sweeter
to
him
than
any
scents
and
were
more
valuable
in
his
eyes
than
precious
stones
but
he
had
never
as
yet
actually
asked
her
to
love
him
but
she
was
so
quick
a
linguist
that
she
had
understood
down
to
the
last
letter
what
all
these
tokens
had
meant
her
cousin
captain
scarborough
was
to
her
magnificent
powerful
but
terrible
withal
she
had
asked
herself
a
thousand
times
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
her
to
love
him
and
to
become
his
wife
she
had
never
quite
given
even
to
herself
an
answer
to
this
question
till
she
had
suddenly
found
herself
enabled
to
do
so
by
his
in
asking
her
to
confess
that
she
loved
him
she
had
never
acknowledged
anything
even
to
herself
as
to
harry
annesley
she
had
never
told
herself
that
it
would
be
possible
that
he
should
ask
her
any
such
question
she
had
a
wild
dreamy
fearful
feeling
that
although
it
would
be
possible
to
her
to
refuse
her
cousin
it
would
be
impossible
that
she
should
marry
any
other
while
he
should
still
be
desirous
of
making
her
his
wife
and
now
captain
scarborough
had
threatened
harry
annesley
not
indeed
by
name
but
still
clearly
enough
any
dream
of
her
own
in
that
direction
must
be
a
vain
dream
as
harry
annesley
is
going
to
be
what
is
generally
called
the
hero
of
this
story
it
is
necessary
that
something
should
be
said
of
the
particulars
of
his
life
and
existence
up
to
this
period
there
will
be
found
to
be
nothing
very
heroic
about
him
he
is
a
young
man
with
more
than
a
fair
allowance
of
a
young
man
folly
it
may
also
be
said
of
a
young
man
weakness
but
i
myself
am
inclined
to
think
that
there
was
but
little
of
a
young
man
selfishness
with
nothing
of
falseness
or
dishonesty
and
i
am
therefore
tempted
to
tell
his
story
he
was
the
son
of
a
clergyman
and
the
eldest
of
a
large
family
of
children
but
as
he
was
the
acknowledged
heir
to
his
mother
brother
who
was
the
squire
of
the
parish
of
which
his
father
was
rector
it
was
not
thought
necessary
that
he
should
follow
any
profession
this
uncle
was
the
squire
of
buston
and
was
after
all
not
a
rich
man
himself
his
whole
property
did
not
exceed
two
thousand
a
year
an
income
which
fifty
years
since
was
supposed
to
be
sufficient
for
the
moderate
wants
of
a
moderate
country
gentleman
but
though
buston
be
not
very
far
removed
from
the
centre
of
everything
being
in
hertfordshire
and
not
more
than
forty
miles
from
london
prosper
lived
so
retired
a
life
and
was
so
far
removed
from
the
ways
of
men
that
he
apparently
did
not
know
but
that
his
heir
was
as
completely
entitled
to
lead
an
idle
life
as
though
he
were
the
son
of
a
duke
or
a
brewer
it
must
not
however
be
imagined
that
prosper
was
especially
attached
to
his
nephew
when
the
boy
left
the
where
his
uncle
had
paid
his
he
was
sent
to
cambridge
with
an
allowance
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
that
allowance
was
still
continued
to
him
with
an
assurance
that
under
no
circumstances
could
it
ever
be
increased
at
college
he
had
been
successful
and
left
cambridge
with
a
college
fellowship
he
therefore
left
it
with
one
hundred
and
pounds
added
to
his
income
and
was
considered
by
all
those
at
buston
rectory
to
be
a
rich
young
man
but
harry
did
not
find
that
his
combined
income
amounted
to
riches
amid
a
world
of
idleness
at
buston
he
was
constantly
told
by
his
uncle
of
the
necessity
of
economy
indeed
prosper
who
was
a
sickly
little
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
always
spoke
of
himself
as
though
he
intended
to
live
for
another
he
rarely
walked
across
the
park
to
the
rectory
and
once
a
week
on
sundays
entertained
the
rectory
family
a
sad
occasion
it
generally
was
to
the
elder
of
the
rectory
children
who
were
thus
doomed
to
abandon
the
loud
pleasantries
of
their
own
home
for
the
sober
sunday
solemnities
of
the
hall
it
was
not
that
the
squire
of
buston
was
peculiarly
a
religious
man
or
that
the
rector
was
the
reverse
but
the
parson
was
joyous
whereas
the
other
was
solemn
the
squire
who
never
went
to
church
because
he
was
supposed
to
be
ill
made
up
for
the
deficiency
by
his
devotional
tendencies
when
the
children
were
at
the
hall
he
read
through
a
sermon
after
dinner
unintelligibly
and
even
inaudibly
at
this
his
who
had
an
evening
service
in
his
own
church
of
course
never
was
present
but
annesley
and
the
girls
were
there
and
the
younger
children
but
harry
annesley
had
absolutely
declined
and
his
uncle
having
found
out
that
he
never
attended
the
church
service
although
he
always
left
the
hall
with
his
father
made
this
a
ground
for
a
quarrel
it
at
last
came
to
pass
that
prosper
who
was
jealous
and
irritable
would
hardly
speak
to
his
nephew
but
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
went
on
with
many
bickerings
on
the
subject
between
the
parson
and
the
squire
once
when
the
squire
spoke
of
discontinuing
it
harry
father
reminded
him
that
the
young
man
had
been
brought
up
in
absolute
idleness
in
conformity
with
his
uncle
desire
this
the
squire
denied
in
strong
language
but
harry
had
not
hitherto
run
loudly
in
debt
nor
kicked
over
the
traces
very
outrageously
and
as
he
absolutely
must
be
the
heir
the
allowance
was
permitted
to
go
on
there
was
one
lady
who
conceived
all
manner
of
bad
things
as
to
harry
annesley
because
as
she
alleged
of
the
want
of
a
profession
and
of
any
fixed
income
mountjoy
florence
mother
was
this
lady
florence
herself
had
read
every
word
in
harry
language
not
knowing
indeed
that
she
had
read
anything
but
still
never
having
missed
a
single
letter
mountjoy
also
had
read
a
good
deal
though
not
all
and
dreaded
the
appearance
of
harry
as
a
declared
lover
in
her
eyes
captain
scarborough
was
a
very
handsome
very
powerful
and
very
grand
personage
but
she
feared
that
florence
was
being
induced
to
refuse
her
allegiance
to
this
sovereign
by
the
interference
of
her
other
very
indifferent
suitor
what
would
be
buston
and
two
thousand
a
year
as
compared
with
all
the
glories
and
limitless
income
of
the
great
tretton
property
captain
scarborough
with
his
mustaches
and
magnificence
was
just
the
man
who
would
be
sure
to
become
a
peer
she
had
always
heard
the
income
fixed
at
thirty
thousand
a
year
what
would
a
few
debts
signify
to
thirty
thousand
a
year
such
had
been
her
thoughts
up
to
the
period
of
captain
scarborough
late
visit
when
he
had
come
to
cheltenham
and
had
renewed
his
demand
for
florence
hand
somewhat
roughly
he
had
spoken
ambiguous
words
dreadful
words
declaring
that
an
internecine
quarrel
had
taken
place
between
him
and
his
father
but
these
words
though
they
had
been
very
dreadful
had
been
altogether
misunderstood
by
mountjoy
the
property
she
knew
to
be
entailed
and
she
knew
that
when
a
property
was
entailed
the
present
owner
of
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
its
future
disposition
captain
scarborough
at
any
rate
was
anxious
for
the
marriage
and
mountjoy
was
inclined
to
accept
him
encumbered
as
he
now
was
with
his
father
wrath
in
preference
to
poor
harry
annesley
in
june
harry
came
up
to
london
and
there
learned
at
his
club
the
singular
story
in
regard
to
old
scarborough
and
his
son
scarborough
had
declared
his
son
illegitimate
and
all
the
world
knew
now
that
he
was
utterly
penniless
and
hopelessly
in
debt
that
he
had
been
greatly
embarrassed
harry
had
known
for
many
months
and
added
to
that
was
now
the
fact
very
generally
believed
that
he
was
not
and
never
had
been
the
heir
to
tretton
park
all
that
still
increasing
property
about
tretton
on
which
so
many
hopes
had
been
founded
would
belong
to
his
brother
harry
as
he
heard
the
tale
immediately
connected
it
with
florence
he
had
of
course
known
the
captain
was
a
suitor
to
the
girl
hand
and
there
had
been
a
time
when
he
thought
that
his
own
hopes
were
consequently
vain
gradually
the
conviction
dawned
upon
him
that
florence
did
not
love
the
grand
warrior
that
she
was
afraid
of
him
rather
and
it
would
be
terrible
now
were
she
brought
to
marry
him
by
this
feeling
of
awe
then
he
learned
that
the
warrior
had
gone
down
to
cheltenham
and
in
the
restlessness
of
his
spirit
he
pursued
him
when
he
reached
cheltenham
the
warrior
had
already
gone
the
property
is
certainly
entailed
said
mountjoy
he
had
called
at
once
at
the
house
and
saw
the
mother
but
florence
was
discreetly
sent
away
to
her
own
room
when
the
dangerous
young
man
was
admitted
he
is
not
scarborough
eldest
son
at
all
said
harry
that
is
in
the
eye
of
the
law
then
he
had
to
undertake
that
task
very
difficult
for
a
young
man
of
explaining
to
her
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
but
there
was
something
in
them
so
dreadful
to
the
lady
imagination
that
he
failed
for
a
long
time
to
make
her
comprehend
it
do
you
mean
to
say
that
scarborough
was
not
married
to
his
own
wife
not
at
first
and
that
he
knew
it
no
doubt
he
knew
it
he
confesses
as
much
himself
what
a
very
wicked
man
he
must
be
said
mountjoy
harry
could
only
shrug
his
shoulder
and
he
meant
to
rob
augustus
all
through
harry
again
shrugged
his
shoulder
is
it
not
much
more
probable
that
if
he
could
be
so
very
wicked
he
would
be
willing
to
deny
his
eldest
son
in
order
to
save
paying
the
debts
harry
could
only
declare
that
the
facts
were
as
he
told
them
or
at
least
that
all
london
believed
them
to
be
so
that
at
any
rate
captain
mountjoy
had
gambled
so
recklessly
as
to
put
himself
for
ever
and
ever
out
of
reach
of
a
shilling
of
the
property
and
that
it
was
clearly
the
duty
of
mountjoy
as
florence
mother
not
to
accept
him
as
a
suitor
it
was
only
by
slow
degrees
that
the
conversation
had
arrived
at
this
pass
harry
had
never
as
yet
declared
his
own
love
either
to
the
mother
or
daughter
and
now
appeared
simply
as
a
narrator
of
this
terrible
story
but
at
this
point
it
did
appear
to
him
that
he
must
introduce
himself
in
another
guise
the
fact
is
mountjoy
he
said
starting
to
his
feet
that
i
am
in
love
with
your
daughter
myself
and
therefore
you
have
come
here
to
vilify
captain
scarborough
i
have
come
said
he
at
any
rate
to
tell
the
truth
if
it
be
as
i
say
you
can
not
think
it
right
that
he
should
marry
your
daughter
i
say
nothing
of
myself
but
that
at
any
rate
can
not
be
it
is
no
business
of
yours
mr
annesley
except
that
i
would
fain
think
that
her
business
should
be
mine
but
he
could
not
prevail
with
mountjoy
either
on
this
day
or
the
next
to
allow
him
to
see
florence
and
at
last
was
obliged
to
leave
cheltenham
without
having
done
so
chapter
iv
captain
scarborough
disappearance
a
few
days
after
the
visits
to
cheltenham
described
in
the
last
chapters
harry
annesley
coming
down
a
passage
by
the
side
of
the
junior
united
service
club
into
charles
street
suddenly
met
captain
scarborough
at
two
in
the
morning
where
harry
had
been
at
that
hour
need
not
now
be
explained
but
it
may
be
presumed
that
he
had
not
been
drinking
tea
with
any
of
his
female
relatives
captain
scarborough
had
just
come
out
of
some
neighboring
club
where
he
had
certainly
been
playing
and
where
to
all
appearances
he
had
been
drinking
also
that
there
should
have
been
no
policemen
in
the
street
was
not
remarkable
but
there
was
no
one
else
there
present
to
give
any
account
of
what
took
place
during
the
five
minutes
in
which
the
two
men
remained
together
harry
who
was
at
the
moment
surprised
by
the
encounter
would
have
passed
the
captain
by
without
notice
had
he
been
allowed
to
do
so
but
this
the
captain
perceived
and
stopped
him
suddenly
taking
him
roughly
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
this
harry
naturally
resented
and
before
a
word
of
intelligible
explanation
had
been
given
the
two
young
men
had
quarrelled
captain
scarborough
had
received
a
long
letter
from
mountjoy
praying
for
explanation
of
circumstances
which
could
not
be
explained
and
stating
over
and
over
again
that
all
her
information
had
come
from
harry
annesley
the
captain
now
called
him
an
interfering
meddlesome
idiot
and
shook
him
violently
while
holding
him
in
his
grasp
this
was
a
usage
which
harry
was
not
the
man
to
endure
and
there
soon
arose
a
scuffle
in
which
blows
had
passed
between
them
the
captain
stuck
to
his
prey
shaking
him
again
and
again
in
his
drunken
wrath
till
harry
roused
to
a
passion
almost
equal
to
that
of
his
opponent
flung
him
at
last
against
the
corner
of
the
club
railings
and
there
left
his
foe
sprawling
upon
the
ground
having
struck
his
head
violently
against
the
ground
as
he
fell
harry
passed
on
to
his
own
bed
indifferent
as
it
was
afterwards
said
to
the
fate
of
his
antagonist
all
this
occupied
probably
five
minutes
in
the
doing
but
was
seen
by
no
human
eye
as
the
occurrence
of
that
night
was
subsequently
made
the
ground
for
heavy
accusation
against
harry
annesley
it
has
been
told
here
with
sufficient
minuteness
to
show
what
might
be
said
in
justification
or
in
condemnation
of
his
conduct
to
show
what
might
be
said
if
the
truth
were
spoken
for
indeed
in
the
discussions
which
arose
on
the
subject
much
was
said
which
was
not
true
when
he
had
retired
from
the
scuffle
on
that
night
harry
had
certainly
not
dreamed
that
any
serious
damage
had
been
done
to
the
man
who
had
certainly
been
altogether
to
blame
in
his
provocation
of
the
quarrel
had
he
kept
his
temper
and
feelings
completely
under
control
and
knocked
down
captain
scarborough
only
in
had
he
not
allowed
himself
to
be
roused
to
wrath
by
treatment
which
could
not
but
give
rise
to
wrath
in
a
young
man
bosom
no
doubt
when
his
foe
lay
at
his
feet
he
would
have
stooped
to
pick
him
up
and
have
tended
his
wounds
but
such
was
not
character
nor
that
of
any
of
the
young
men
with
whom
i
have
been
acquainted
such
however
was
the
conduct
apparently
expected
from
him
by
many
when
the
circumstances
of
those
five
minutes
were
brought
to
the
light
but
on
the
other
hand
had
passion
not
completely
got
the
better
of
him
had
he
not
at
the
moment
considered
the
attack
made
upon
him
to
amount
to
misconduct
so
gross
as
to
supersede
all
necessity
for
gentle
usage
on
his
own
part
he
would
hardly
have
left
the
man
to
live
or
die
as
chance
would
have
it
boiling
with
passion
he
went
his
way
and
did
leave
the
man
on
the
pavement
not
caring
much
or
rather
not
thinking
much
whether
his
victim
might
live
or
die
on
the
next
day
harry
annesley
left
london
and
went
down
to
buston
having
heard
no
word
farther
about
the
captain
he
did
not
start
till
late
in
the
afternoon
and
during
the
day
took
some
trouble
to
make
himself
conspicuous
about
the
town
but
he
heard
nothing
of
captain
scarborough
twice
he
walked
along
charles
street
and
looked
at
the
spot
on
which
he
had
stood
on
the
night
before
in
what
might
have
been
deadly
conflict
then
he
told
himself
that
he
had
not
been
in
the
least
wounded
that
the
ferocious
maddened
man
had
attempted
to
do
no
more
than
shake
him
that
his
coat
had
suffered
and
not
himself
and
that
in
return
he
had
certainly
struck
the
captain
with
all
his
violence
there
were
probably
some
regrets
but
he
said
not
a
word
on
the
subject
to
any
one
and
so
he
left
london
for
three
or
four
days
nothing
was
heard
of
the
captain
nor
was
anything
said
about
him
he
had
lodgings
in
town
at
which
he
was
no
doubt
missed
but
he
also
had
quarters
at
the
barracks
at
which
he
did
not
often
sleep
but
to
which
it
was
thought
possible
on
the
next
morning
that
he
might
have
betaken
himself
before
the
evening
of
that
day
had
come
he
had
no
doubt
been
missed
but
in
the
world
at
large
no
special
mention
was
made
of
his
absence
for
some
time
then
among
the
haunts
which
he
was
known
to
frequent
questions
began
to
be
asked
as
to
his
whereabouts
and
to
be
answered
by
doubtful
assertions
that
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
of
him
for
the
last
sixty
or
seventy
hours
it
must
be
remembered
that
at
this
time
captain
scarborough
was
still
the
subject
of
universal
remark
because
of
the
story
told
as
to
his
birth
his
father
had
declared
him
to
be
illegitimate
and
had
thereby
robbed
all
his
creditors
captain
scarborough
was
a
man
quite
remarkable
enough
to
insure
universal
attention
for
such
a
tale
as
this
but
now
added
to
his
illegitimacy
was
his
disappearance
there
was
at
first
no
idea
that
he
had
been
murdered
it
became
quickly
known
to
all
the
world
that
he
had
on
the
night
in
question
lost
a
large
sum
of
money
at
a
which
he
frequented
and
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
the
club
had
not
paid
the
money
on
the
spot
the
fatal
monday
had
come
round
and
the
money
undoubtedly
was
not
paid
then
he
was
declared
a
defaulter
and
in
due
process
of
time
his
name
was
struck
off
the
club
books
with
some
serious
increase
of
the
ignominy
hitherto
sustained
during
the
last
fortnight
or
more
captain
scarborough
name
had
been
subjected
to
many
remarks
and
to
much
disgrace
but
this
of
the
money
lost
at
whist
was
considered
to
be
the
a
man
might
be
declared
illegitimate
and
might
in
consequence
of
that
or
any
other
circumstance
defraud
all
his
creditors
a
man
might
conspire
with
his
father
with
the
object
of
doing
this
fraudulently
as
captain
scarborough
was
no
doubt
thought
to
have
done
by
most
of
his
acquaintances
all
this
he
might
do
and
not
become
so
degraded
but
that
his
friends
would
talk
to
him
and
play
cards
with
him
but
to
have
sat
down
to
a
and
not
be
able
to
pay
the
stakes
was
held
to
be
so
foul
a
disgrace
that
men
did
not
wonder
that
he
should
have
disappeared
such
was
the
cause
alleged
for
the
captain
disappearance
among
his
intimate
friends
but
by
degrees
more
than
his
intimate
friends
came
to
talk
of
it
in
a
short
time
his
name
was
in
all
the
newspapers
and
there
was
not
a
constable
in
london
whose
mind
was
not
greatly
exercised
on
the
matter
all
scotland
yard
and
the
were
busy
grey
in
lincoln
inn
was
much
troubled
on
the
matter
by
degrees
facts
had
made
themselves
clear
to
his
mind
and
he
had
become
aware
that
the
captain
had
been
born
before
his
client
marriage
he
was
ineffably
shocked
at
the
old
squire
villany
in
the
matter
but
declared
to
all
to
whom
he
spoke
openly
on
the
subject
that
he
did
not
see
how
the
sinner
could
be
punished
he
never
thought
that
the
father
and
son
were
in
a
conspiracy
together
nor
had
he
believed
that
they
had
arranged
the
young
man
disappearance
in
order
the
more
thoroughly
to
defraud
the
creditors
they
could
not
at
any
rate
harm
a
man
of
whose
whereabouts
they
were
unaware
and
who
for
all
they
knew
might
be
dead
but
the
reader
is
already
aware
that
this
surmise
on
the
part
of
grey
was
unfounded
the
captain
had
been
absent
for
three
weeks
when
augustus
scarborough
went
down
for
a
second
time
to
tretton
park
in
order
to
discuss
the
matter
with
his
father
augustus
had
with
much
equanimity
and
a
steady
fixed
purpose
settled
himself
down
to
the
position
as
elder
son
he
pretended
no
anger
to
his
father
for
the
injury
intended
and
was
only
anxious
that
his
own
rights
should
be
confirmed
in
this
he
found
that
no
great
difficulty
stood
in
his
way
the
creditors
would
contest
his
rights
when
his
father
should
die
but
for
such
contest
he
would
be
prepared
he
had
no
doubt
as
to
his
own
position
but
thought
that
it
would
be
safer
and
that
it
would
also
probably
be
cheaper
to
purchase
the
acquiescence
of
all
claimants
than
to
encounter
the
expense
of
a
prolonged
trial
to
which
there
might
be
more
than
one
appeal
and
of
which
the
end
after
all
would
be
doubtful
no
very
great
sum
of
money
would
probably
be
required
no
very
great
sum
would
at
any
rate
be
offered
but
such
an
arrangement
would
certainly
be
easier
if
his
brother
were
not
present
to
be
confronted
with
the
men
whom
he
had
duped
the
squire
was
still
ill
down
at
tretton
but
not
so
ill
but
that
he
had
his
wits
about
him
in
all
their
clearness
some
said
that
he
was
not
ill
at
all
but
that
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
the
retirement
suited
him
but
the
nature
of
the
operation
which
he
had
undergone
was
known
to
many
who
would
not
have
him
harassed
in
his
present
condition
in
truth
he
had
only
to
refuse
admission
to
all
visitors
and
to
take
care
that
his
commands
were
carried
out
in
order
to
avoid
disagreeable
intrusions
do
you
mean
to
say
that
a
man
can
do
such
a
thing
as
this
and
that
no
one
can
touch
him
for
it
this
was
an
exclamation
made
by
tyrrwhit
to
his
lawyer
in
a
tone
of
aggrieved
disgust
he
has
done
anything
said
the
lawyer
he
only
thought
of
doing
something
and
has
since
repented
you
can
not
arrest
a
man
because
he
had
contemplated
the
picking
of
your
pocket
especially
when
he
has
shown
that
he
is
resolved
not
to
pick
it
as
far
as
i
can
learn
nothing
has
been
heard
about
him
as
yet
said
the
son
to
the
father
those
limbs
were
his
that
were
picked
out
of
the
thames
near
blackfriars
bridge
they
belonged
to
a
poor
cripple
who
was
murdered
two
months
since
and
that
body
that
was
found
down
among
the
yorkshire
hills
he
was
a
peddler
there
is
nothing
to
induce
a
belief
that
mountjoy
has
killed
himself
or
been
killed
in
the
former
case
his
dead
body
would
be
found
or
his
live
body
would
be
missing
for
the
second
there
is
no
imaginable
cause
for
suspicion
then
where
the
devil
is
he
said
the
anxious
father
ah
that
the
difficulty
but
i
can
imagine
no
position
in
which
a
man
might
be
more
tempted
to
hide
himself
he
is
disgraced
on
every
side
and
could
hardly
show
his
face
in
london
after
the
money
he
has
lost
you
would
not
have
paid
his
gambling
debts
certainly
not
said
the
father
there
must
be
an
end
to
all
things
nor
could
i
within
the
last
month
past
he
has
drawn
from
me
every
shilling
that
i
have
had
at
my
immediate
command
why
did
you
give
to
him
it
would
be
difficult
to
explain
all
the
reasons
he
was
then
my
elder
brother
and
it
suited
me
to
have
him
somewhat
under
my
hand
at
any
rate
i
did
do
so
and
am
unable
for
the
present
to
do
more
looking
round
about
i
do
not
see
where
it
was
possible
for
him
to
raise
a
sovereign
as
soon
as
it
was
once
known
that
he
was
nobody
what
will
become
of
him
said
the
father
i
do
like
the
idea
of
his
being
starved
he
ca
live
without
something
to
live
upon
god
tempers
the
wind
to
the
shorn
lamb
said
the
son
for
lambs
such
as
he
there
always
seems
to
be
pasture
provided
of
one
sort
or
another
you
would
not
like
to
have
to
trust
to
such
pastures
said
the
father
nor
should
i
like
to
be
hanged
but
i
should
have
to
be
hanged
if
i
had
committed
murder
think
of
the
chances
which
he
has
had
and
the
way
in
which
he
has
misused
them
although
illegitimate
he
was
to
have
had
the
whole
property
of
which
not
a
shilling
belongs
to
him
and
he
has
not
lost
it
because
it
was
not
his
own
but
has
simply
gambled
it
away
among
the
jews
what
can
happen
to
a
man
in
such
a
condition
better
than
to
turn
up
as
a
hunter
among
the
rocky
mountains
or
as
a
in
australia
in
this
last
adventure
he
seems
to
have
plunged
horribly
and
to
have
lost
over
three
thousand
pounds
you
would
have
paid
that
for
him
not
again
certainly
not
again
then
what
could
he
do
better
than
disappear
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
make
him
an
allowance
some
of
these
days
and
if
he
can
live
and
keep
himself
dark
i
will
do
so
there
was
in
this
a
tacit
allusion
to
his
father
speedy
death
which
was
grim
enough
but
the
father
passed
it
by
without
any
expression
of
displeasure
he
certainly
owed
much
to
his
younger
son
and
was
willing
to
pay
it
by
quiescence
let
them
both
forbear
such
was
the
language
which
he
held
to
himself
in
thinking
of
his
younger
son
augustus
was
certainly
behaving
well
to
him
not
a
word
of
rebuke
had
passed
his
lips
as
to
the
infamous
attempt
at
spoliation
which
had
been
made
the
old
squire
felt
grateful
for
his
younger
son
conduct
but
yet
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
preferred
the
elder
he
has
denuded
me
of
every
penny
said
augustus
and
i
must
ask
you
to
refund
me
something
of
what
has
gone
he
has
kept
me
very
bare
a
man
with
so
great
a
propensity
for
getting
rid
of
money
i
think
no
father
ever
before
had
to
endure
you
have
had
the
last
of
it
i
do
not
know
that
if
i
live
and
he
lets
me
know
his
whereabouts
i
can
not
leave
him
penniless
i
do
feel
that
a
great
injustice
has
been
done
him
i
do
exactly
see
it
said
augustus
because
you
too
to
put
yourself
in
another
man
place
he
was
my
eldest
son
he
thought
that
he
was
and
should
have
remained
so
had
there
been
a
hope
for
him
said
the
squire
roused
to
temporary
anger
augustus
only
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
there
is
no
good
talking
about
it
not
the
least
in
the
world
grey
i
suppose
knows
the
truth
at
last
i
shall
have
to
get
three
or
four
thousand
pounds
from
you
or
i
too
must
resort
to
the
jews
i
shall
do
it
at
any
rate
under
better
circumstances
than
my
brother
some
arrangement
was
at
last
made
which
was
satisfactory
to
the
son
and
which
we
must
presume
that
the
father
found
to
be
endurable
then
the
son
took
his
leave
and
went
back
to
london
with
the
understood
intention
of
pushing
the
inquiries
as
to
his
brother
existence
and
whereabouts
the
sudden
and
complete
disappearance
of
captain
scarborough
struck
mountjoy
with
the
deepest
awe
it
was
not
at
first
borne
in
upon
her
to
believe
that
captain
mountjoy
scarborough
an
officer
in
the
coldstreams
and
the
acknowledged
heir
to
the
tretton
property
had
vanished
away
as
a
stray
might
do
or
some
lowest
but
at
last
there
were
advertisements
in
all
the
newspapers
and
placards
on
all
the
walls
and
mountjoy
did
understand
that
the
captain
was
gone
she
could
as
yet
hardly
believe
that
he
was
no
longer
heir
to
tretton
and
in
such
short
discussions
with
florence
as
were
necessary
on
the
subject
she
preferred
to
express
no
opinion
whatever
as
to
his
conduct
but
she
would
by
no
means
give
way
when
urged
to
acknowledge
that
no
marriage
between
florence
and
the
captain
was
any
longer
to
be
regarded
as
possible
while
the
captain
was
away
the
matter
should
be
left
as
if
in
abeyance
but
this
by
no
means
suited
the
young
lady
views
mountjoy
was
not
a
reticent
woman
and
had
no
doubt
been
too
free
in
whispering
among
her
friends
something
of
her
daughter
position
this
florence
had
resented
but
it
had
still
been
done
and
in
cheltenham
generally
she
was
regarded
as
an
engaged
young
lady
it
had
been
in
vain
that
she
had
denied
that
it
was
so
her
mother
word
on
such
a
subject
was
supposed
to
be
more
credible
that
her
own
and
now
this
man
with
whom
she
was
believed
to
be
so
closely
connected
had
disappeared
from
the
world
among
the
most
disreputable
circumstances
but
when
she
explained
the
difficulty
to
her
mother
her
mother
bade
her
hold
her
tongue
for
the
present
and
seemed
to
hold
out
a
hope
that
the
captain
might
at
last
be
restored
to
his
old
position
let
them
restore
him
ever
so
much
he
would
never
be
anything
to
me
mamma
then
mountjoy
would
only
shake
her
head
and
purse
her
lips
on
the
evening
of
the
day
after
the
fracas
in
the
street
harry
annesley
went
down
to
buston
and
there
remained
for
the
next
two
or
three
days
holding
his
tongue
absolutely
as
to
the
adventure
of
that
night
there
was
no
one
at
buston
to
whom
he
would
probably
have
made
known
the
circumstances
but
there
was
clinging
to
it
a
certain
flavor
of
disreputable
conduct
on
his
own
part
which
sealed
his
lips
altogether
the
louder
and
more
frequent
the
tidings
which
reached
his
ears
as
to
the
captain
departure
the
more
strongly
did
he
feel
that
duty
required
him
to
tell
what
he
knew
upon
the
matter
many
thoughts
and
many
fears
encompassed
him
at
first
was
the
idea
that
he
had
killed
the
man
by
the
violence
of
his
blow
or
that
his
death
had
been
caused
by
the
fall
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
that
scarborough
should
have
been
killed
and
that
no
account
should
be
given
as
to
the
finding
of
the
body
at
last
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
could
not
have
killed
the
man
but
he
was
assured
at
the
same
time
that
the
disappearance
must
in
some
sort
have
been
occasioned
by
what
then
took
place
and
it
could
not
but
be
that
the
captain
if
alive
should
be
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
struggle
which
had
taken
place
he
heard
chiefly
from
the
newspapers
the
full
record
of
the
illegitimacy
he
heard
of
his
condition
with
the
creditors
he
heard
of
those
gambling
debts
which
were
left
unpaid
at
the
club
he
saw
it
also
stated
and
repeated
that
these
were
the
grounds
for
the
disappearance
it
was
quite
credible
that
the
man
should
disappear
or
endeavor
to
disappear
under
such
a
cloud
of
difficulties
it
did
not
require
that
he
and
his
violence
should
be
adduced
as
an
extra
cause
indeed
had
the
man
been
minded
to
vanish
before
the
encounter
he
might
in
all
human
probability
have
been
deterred
by
the
circumstances
of
the
quarrel
it
gave
no
extra
reason
for
his
disappearance
and
could
in
no
wise
be
counted
with
it
were
he
to
tell
the
whole
story
in
scotland
yard
he
had
been
grossly
misused
on
the
occasion
and
had
escaped
from
such
misusage
by
the
only
means
in
his
power
but
still
he
felt
that
had
he
told
the
story
people
far
and
wide
would
have
connected
his
name
with
the
man
absence
and
worse
again
that
florence
name
would
have
become
entangled
with
it
also
for
the
first
day
or
two
he
had
from
hour
to
hour
abstained
from
telling
all
that
he
knew
and
then
when
the
day
or
two
were
passed
and
when
a
week
had
run
by
when
a
fortnight
had
been
allowed
to
go
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
hold
his
tongue
he
became
nervous
unhappy
and
irritated
down
at
buston
with
his
father
and
mother
and
sister
but
more
especially
with
his
uncle
previous
to
this
his
uncle
for
a
couple
of
months
had
declined
to
see
him
now
he
was
sent
for
to
the
hall
and
interrogated
daily
on
this
special
subject
prosper
was
aware
that
his
nephew
had
been
intimate
with
augustus
scarborough
and
that
he
might
therefore
be
presumed
to
know
much
about
the
family
prosper
took
the
keenest
interest
in
the
illegitimacy
and
the
impecuniosity
and
final
disappearance
of
the
captain
and
no
doubt
did
in
his
discover
the
fact
that
harry
was
unwilling
to
answer
his
questions
he
found
out
for
the
first
time
that
harry
was
acquainted
with
the
captain
and
also
contrived
to
extract
from
him
the
name
of
miss
mountjoy
but
he
could
learn
nothing
else
beyond
harry
absolute
unwillingness
to
talk
upon
the
subject
which
was
in
itself
much
it
must
be
understood
that
harry
was
not
specially
reverential
in
these
communications
indeed
he
gave
his
uncle
to
understand
that
he
regarded
his
questions
as
impertinent
and
at
last
declared
his
intention
of
not
coming
to
the
hall
any
more
for
the
present
then
prosper
whispered
to
his
sister
that
he
was
quite
sure
that
harry
annesley
knew
more
than
he
choose
to
say
as
to
captain
scarborough
whereabouts
my
dear
peter
said
annesley
i
really
think
that
you
are
doing
poor
harry
an
injustice
annesley
was
always
on
her
guard
to
maintain
something
like
an
affectionate
intercourse
between
her
own
family
and
the
squire
my
dear
anne
you
do
not
see
into
a
millstone
as
far
as
i
do
you
never
did
but
peter
you
really
should
say
such
things
of
harry
when
all
the
themselves
are
looking
about
to
catch
up
anything
in
their
way
they
would
catch
him
up
at
a
moment
notice
if
they
heard
that
a
magistrate
of
the
county
had
expressed
such
an
opinion
why
do
he
tell
me
said
prosper
there
nothing
to
tell
ah
that
your
opinion
because
you
ca
see
into
a
millstone
i
tell
you
that
harry
knows
more
about
this
captain
scarborough
than
any
one
else
they
were
very
intimate
together
harry
only
just
knew
him
well
you
see
i
tell
you
that
harry
name
will
become
mixed
up
with
captain
scarborough
and
i
hope
that
it
will
be
in
no
discreditable
manner
i
hope
so
that
all
harry
in
the
mean
time
had
returned
to
london
in
order
to
escape
his
uncle
and
to
be
on
the
spot
to
learn
anything
that
might
come
in
his
way
as
to
the
now
acknowledged
mystery
respecting
the
captain
such
was
the
state
of
things
at
the
commencement
of
the
period
to
which
my
story
refers
chapter
augustus
scarborough
harry
annesley
when
he
found
himself
in
london
could
not
for
a
moment
shake
off
that
feeling
of
nervous
anxiety
as
to
the
fate
of
mountjoy
scarborough
which
had
seized
hold
of
him
in
every
newspaper
which
he
took
in
his
hand
he
looked
first
for
the
paragraph
respecting
the
fate
of
the
missing
man
which
the
paper
was
sure
to
contain
in
one
of
its
columns
it
was
his
habit
during
these
few
days
to
breakfast
at
a
club
and
he
could
not
abstain
from
speaking
to
his
neighbors
about
the
wonderful
scarborough
incident
every
man
was
at
this
time
willing
to
speak
on
the
subject
and
harry
interest
might
not
have
seemed
to
be
peculiar
but
it
became
known
that
he
had
been
acquainted
with
the
missing
man
and
harry
in
conversation
said
much
more
than
it
would
have
been
prudent
for
him
to
do
on
the
understanding
that
he
wished
to
remain
unconnected
with
the
story
men
asked
him
questions
as
though
he
were
likely
to
know
and
he
would
answer
them
asserting
that
he
knew
nothing
but
still
leaving
an
impression
behind
that
he
did
know
more
than
he
chose
to
avow
many
inquiries
were
made
daily
at
this
time
in
scotland
yard
as
to
the
captain
these
no
doubt
chiefly
came
from
the
creditors
and
their
allies
but
harry
annesley
became
known
among
those
who
asked
for
information
as
henry
annesley
late
of
college
cambridge
and
even
the
police
were
taught
to
think
that
there
was
something
noticeable
in
the
interest
which
he
displayed
on
the
fourth
day
after
his
arrival
in
london
just
at
that
time
of
the
year
when
everybody
was
supposed
to
be
leaving
town
and
when
faded
members
of
parliament
who
allowed
themselves
to
be
retained
for
the
purpose
of
final
divisions
were
cursing
their
fate
amid
the
heats
of
august
harry
accepted
an
invitation
to
dine
with
augustus
scarborough
at
his
chambers
in
the
temple
he
understood
when
he
accepted
the
invitation
that
no
one
else
was
to
be
there
and
must
have
been
aware
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
heir
of
tretton
to
talk
to
him
respecting
his
brother
he
had
not
seen
scarborough
since
he
had
been
up
in
town
and
had
not
been
desirous
of
seeing
him
but
when
the
invitation
came
he
had
told
himself
that
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
accept
it
and
that
he
would
allow
his
host
to
say
what
he
pleased
to
say
on
the
subject
he
himself
remaining
reticent
but
poor
harry
little
knew
the
difficulty
of
reticency
when
the
heart
is
full
he
had
intended
to
be
very
reticent
when
he
came
up
to
london
and
had
in
fact
done
nothing
but
talk
about
the
missing
man
as
to
whom
he
had
declared
that
he
would
altogether
hold
his
tongue
the
reader
must
here
be
pleased
to
remember
that
augustus
scarborough
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
what
had
befallen
his
brother
and
must
therefore
have
known
among
other
things
of
the
quarrel
which
had
taken
place
in
the
streets
he
knew
therefore
that
harry
was
concealing
his
knowledge
and
could
make
a
fair
guess
at
the
state
of
the
poor
mind
he
will
guess
he
had
said
to
himself
that
he
did
not
leave
him
for
dead
on
the
ground
or
the
body
would
be
there
to
tell
the
tale
but
he
must
be
ashamed
of
the
part
which
he
took
in
the
and
be
anxious
to
conceal
it
no
doubt
mountjoy
was
the
first
offender
but
something
had
occurred
which
annesley
is
unwilling
should
make
its
way
either
to
his
uncle
ears
or
to
his
father
or
to
mine
or
to
the
squire
or
to
those
of
florence
it
was
thus
that
augustus
scarborough
reasoned
with
himself
when
he
asked
harry
annesley
to
dine
with
him
it
was
not
supposed
by
any
of
his
friends
that
augustus
scarborough
would
continue
to
live
in
the
moderate
chambers
which
he
now
occupied
in
the
temple
but
he
had
as
yet
made
no
sign
of
a
desire
to
leave
them
they
were
up
two
pair
of
stairs
and
were
not
great
in
size
but
they
were
comfortable
enough
and
even
luxurious
as
a
bachelor
abode
i
asked
you
to
come
alone
said
augustus
because
there
is
such
a
crowd
of
things
to
be
talked
of
about
poor
mountjoy
which
are
not
exactly
fitted
for
the
common
ear
yes
indeed
said
harry
who
did
not
however
quite
understand
why
it
would
be
necessary
that
the
heir
should
discuss
with
him
the
affairs
of
his
unfortunate
brother
there
had
no
doubt
been
a
certain
degree
of
intimacy
between
them
but
nothing
which
made
it
essential
that
the
captain
difficulties
should
be
exposed
to
him
the
matter
which
touched
him
most
closely
was
the
love
which
both
the
men
had
borne
to
florence
mountjoy
but
harry
did
not
expect
that
any
allusion
to
florence
would
be
made
on
the
present
occasion
did
you
ever
hear
of
such
a
devil
of
a
mess
said
augustus
no
indeed
it
is
not
only
that
he
has
disappeared
that
is
as
nothing
when
compared
with
all
the
other
incidents
of
this
romantic
tale
indeed
it
is
the
only
natural
thing
in
it
given
all
the
other
circumstances
i
should
have
foretold
his
disappearance
as
a
thing
certain
to
occur
why
should
such
a
man
disappear
if
he
can
but
how
has
he
done
it
replied
harry
where
has
he
gone
to
at
this
moment
where
is
he
ah
if
you
will
answer
all
those
questions
and
give
your
information
in
scotland
yard
the
creditors
no
doubt
will
make
up
a
handsome
purse
for
you
not
that
they
will
ever
get
a
shilling
from
him
though
he
were
to
be
seen
walking
down
james
street
but
they
are
a
sanguine
gentry
these
holders
of
bills
and
i
really
believe
that
if
they
could
see
him
they
would
embrace
him
with
the
warmest
affection
in
the
mean
time
let
us
have
some
dinner
and
we
will
talk
about
poor
mountjoy
when
we
have
got
rid
of
young
pitcher
young
pitcher
is
my
laundress
son
to
the
use
of
whose
services
i
have
been
promoted
since
i
have
been
known
to
be
the
heir
of
tretton
then
they
sat
down
and
dined
and
augustus
scarborough
made
himself
agreeable
the
small
dinner
was
excellent
of
its
kind
and
the
wine
was
all
that
it
ought
to
be
during
dinner
not
a
word
was
said
as
to
mountjoy
nor
as
to
the
affairs
of
the
estate
augustus
who
was
old
for
his
age
and
had
already
practised
himself
much
in
london
life
knew
well
how
to
make
himself
agreeable
there
was
plenty
to
be
said
while
young
pitcher
was
passing
in
and
out
of
the
room
so
that
there
appeared
no
awkward
vacancies
of
silence
while
one
course
succeeded
the
other
the
weather
was
very
hot
the
grouse
were
very
tempting
everybody
was
very
dull
and
members
of
parliament
more
stupid
than
anybody
else
but
a
good
time
was
coming
would
harry
come
down
to
tretton
and
see
the
old
governor
there
was
not
much
to
offer
him
in
the
way
of
recreation
but
when
september
came
the
partridges
would
abound
harry
gave
a
that
he
would
go
to
tretton
for
a
week
and
augustus
scarborough
expressed
himself
as
much
gratified
harry
at
the
moment
thought
of
no
reason
why
he
should
not
go
to
tretton
and
thus
committed
himself
to
the
promise
but
he
afterward
felt
that
tretton
was
of
all
places
the
last
which
he
ought
just
at
present
to
visit
at
last
pitcher
and
the
cheese
were
gone
and
young
scarborough
produced
his
cigars
i
want
to
smoke
directly
i
done
eating
he
said
drinking
goes
with
smoking
as
well
as
it
does
with
eating
so
there
need
be
no
stop
for
that
now
tell
me
annesley
what
is
it
that
you
think
about
mountjoy
there
was
an
abruptness
in
the
question
which
for
the
moment
struck
harry
dumb
how
was
he
to
say
what
he
thought
about
mountjoy
scarborough
even
though
he
should
have
no
feeling
to
prevent
him
from
expressing
the
truth
he
knew
or
thought
that
he
knew
mountjoy
scarborough
to
be
a
thorough
blackguard
one
whom
no
sense
of
honesty
kept
from
spending
money
and
who
was
now
a
party
to
robbing
his
creditors
without
the
slightest
compunction
for
it
was
in
harry
mind
that
mountjoy
and
his
father
were
in
league
together
to
save
the
property
by
rescuing
it
from
the
hands
of
the
jews
he
would
have
thought
the
same
as
to
the
old
squire
only
that
the
old
squire
had
not
interfered
with
him
in
reference
to
florence
mountjoy
and
then
there
was
present
to
his
mind
the
brutal
attack
which
had
been
made
on
himself
in
the
street
according
to
his
views
mountjoy
scarborough
was
certainly
a
blackguard
but
he
did
not
feel
inclined
quite
to
say
so
to
the
brother
nor
was
he
perfectly
certain
as
to
his
host
honesty
it
might
be
that
the
three
scarboroughs
were
all
in
a
league
together
and
if
so
he
had
done
very
wrong
as
he
then
remembered
to
say
that
he
would
go
down
to
tretton
when
therefore
he
was
asked
the
question
he
could
only
hold
his
tongue
i
suppose
you
have
some
scruple
in
speaking
because
he
my
brother
you
may
drop
that
altogether
i
think
that
his
career
has
been
what
the
would
call
romantic
but
what
i
who
am
not
one
of
them
should
describe
as
unfortunate
well
yes
taking
it
altogether
it
has
been
unfortunate
i
am
not
a
fellow
but
i
am
driven
to
pity
him
the
worst
of
it
is
that
had
not
my
father
been
induced
at
last
to
tell
the
truth
from
most
dishonest
causes
he
would
not
have
been
a
bit
better
off
than
he
is
i
doubt
whether
he
could
have
raised
another
couple
of
thousand
on
the
day
when
he
went
if
he
had
done
so
then
and
again
more
and
more
to
any
amount
you
choose
to
think
of
it
would
have
been
the
same
with
him
i
suppose
so
his
lust
for
gambling
was
a
bottomless
quicksand
which
no
possible
amount
of
winning
could
ever
have
satiated
let
him
enter
his
club
with
five
thousand
pounds
at
his
banker
and
no
misfortune
could
touch
him
he
being
such
as
he
is
or
alas
for
aught
we
know
such
as
he
was
the
escape
which
the
property
has
had
can
not
but
be
regarded
as
very
fortunate
i
do
care
to
talk
much
of
myself
in
particular
though
no
wrong
can
have
been
done
to
a
man
more
infinite
than
that
which
my
father
contrived
for
me
i
can
not
understand
your
father
said
harry
in
truth
there
was
something
in
scarborough
manner
in
speaking
of
his
father
which
almost
produced
belief
in
harry
mind
he
began
to
doubt
whether
augustus
was
in
the
conspiracy
no
i
should
say
not
it
is
hard
to
understand
that
an
english
gentleman
should
have
the
courage
to
conceive
such
a
plot
and
the
wit
to
carry
it
out
if
mountjoy
had
run
only
decently
straight
or
not
more
than
indecently
crooked
i
should
have
been
a
younger
brother
practising
law
in
the
temple
to
the
end
of
my
days
the
story
of
esau
and
of
jacob
is
as
nothing
to
it
but
that
is
not
the
most
remarkable
circumstance
my
father
for
purposes
of
his
own
which
includes
the
absolute
throwing
over
of
mountjoy
creditors
changes
his
plan
and
is
pleased
to
restore
to
me
that
of
which
he
had
resolved
to
rob
me
what
father
would
dare
to
look
in
the
face
of
the
son
whom
he
had
thus
resolved
to
defraud
my
father
tells
me
the
story
with
a
gentle
chuckle
showing
almost
as
much
indifference
to
mountjoy
ruin
as
to
my
recovered
prosperity
he
has
not
a
blush
when
he
reveals
it
all
he
has
not
a
word
to
say
or
as
far
as
i
can
see
a
thought
as
to
the
opinion
no
doubt
he
is
supposed
to
be
dying
i
do
presume
that
three
or
four
months
will
see
the
end
of
him
in
the
mean
time
he
takes
it
all
as
quietly
as
though
he
had
simply
lent
a
note
to
mountjoy
out
of
my
pocket
you
at
any
rate
will
get
your
property
oh
yes
and
that
no
doubt
is
his
argument
when
he
sees
me
he
is
delighted
to
have
me
down
at
tretton
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
not
feel
the
slightest
animosity
toward
him
but
as
i
look
at
him
i
think
him
to
be
the
most
remarkable
old
gentleman
that
the
world
has
ever
produced
he
is
quite
unconscious
that
i
have
any
ground
of
complaint
against
him
he
has
probably
thought
that
the
circumstances
of
your
brother
birth
should
not
militate
against
his
prospects
but
the
law
my
dear
fellow
said
scarborough
getting
up
from
his
chair
and
standing
with
his
cigar
between
his
finger
and
thumb
the
law
thinks
otherwise
the
making
of
all
right
and
wrong
in
this
world
depends
on
the
law
the
in
my
pocket
is
merely
mine
because
of
the
law
he
did
choose
to
marry
my
mother
before
i
was
born
but
did
not
choose
to
go
through
that
ceremony
before
my
brother
time
that
may
be
a
trifle
to
you
or
to
my
moral
feeling
may
be
a
trifle
but
because
of
that
trifle
all
tretton
will
be
my
property
and
his
attempt
to
rob
me
of
it
was
just
the
same
as
though
he
should
break
into
a
bank
and
steal
what
he
found
there
he
knows
that
just
as
well
as
i
do
but
to
suit
his
own
purposes
he
did
it
there
was
something
in
the
way
in
which
the
young
man
spoke
both
of
his
father
and
mother
which
made
harry
flesh
creep
he
could
not
but
think
of
his
own
father
and
his
own
mother
and
his
feelings
in
regard
to
them
but
here
this
man
was
talking
of
the
misdoings
of
the
one
parent
and
the
other
with
the
most
perfect
of
course
i
understand
all
that
said
harry
there
is
a
manner
of
doing
evil
so
easy
and
indifferent
as
absolutely
to
quell
the
general
feeling
respecting
it
a
man
shall
tell
you
that
he
has
committed
a
murder
in
a
tone
so
careless
as
to
make
you
feel
that
a
murder
is
nothing
i
do
suppose
my
father
can
be
punished
for
his
attempt
to
rob
me
of
twenty
thousand
a
year
and
therefore
he
talks
to
me
about
it
as
though
it
were
a
good
joke
not
only
that
but
he
expects
me
to
receive
it
in
the
same
way
upon
the
whole
he
prevails
i
find
myself
not
in
the
least
angry
with
him
and
rather
obliged
to
him
than
otherwise
for
allowing
me
to
be
his
eldest
son
what
must
mountjoy
feelings
be
said
harry
exactly
what
must
be
mountjoy
feelings
there
is
no
need
to
consider
my
father
but
poor
mountjoy
i
do
suppose
that
he
can
be
dead
i
should
think
not
while
a
man
is
alive
he
can
carry
himself
off
but
when
a
fellow
is
dead
it
requires
at
least
one
or
probably
two
to
carry
him
men
do
not
wish
to
undertake
such
a
work
secretly
unless
they
been
concerned
in
the
murder
and
then
there
will
have
been
a
noise
which
must
have
been
heard
or
blood
which
must
have
been
seen
and
the
body
will
at
last
be
forthcoming
or
some
sign
of
its
destruction
i
do
not
think
he
be
dead
i
should
hope
not
said
harry
rather
tamely
and
feeling
that
he
was
guilty
of
a
falsehood
by
the
manner
in
which
he
expressed
his
hope
when
was
it
you
saw
him
last
scarborough
asked
the
question
with
an
abruptness
which
was
predetermined
but
which
did
not
quite
take
harry
aback
about
three
months
since
in
london
said
harry
going
back
in
his
memory
to
the
last
meeting
which
had
occurred
before
the
squire
had
declared
his
purpose
ah
you
have
seen
him
then
since
he
knew
that
he
was
nobody
this
he
asked
in
an
indifferent
tone
being
anxious
not
to
discover
his
purpose
but
in
doing
so
he
gave
harry
great
credit
for
his
readiness
of
mind
i
have
not
seen
him
since
he
heard
the
news
which
must
have
astonished
him
more
than
any
one
else
i
wonder
said
augustus
how
florence
mountjoy
has
borne
it
neither
have
i
seen
her
i
have
been
at
cheltenham
but
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
this
he
said
with
an
assertion
to
himself
that
though
he
had
lied
as
to
one
particular
he
would
not
lie
as
to
any
other
i
suppose
she
must
have
been
much
cut
up
by
it
all
i
have
half
a
mind
to
declare
to
myself
that
she
shall
still
have
an
opportunity
of
becoming
the
mistress
of
tretton
she
was
always
afraid
of
mountjoy
but
i
do
not
know
that
she
ever
loved
him
she
had
become
so
used
to
the
idea
of
marrying
him
that
she
would
have
given
herself
up
in
mere
obedience
i
too
think
that
she
might
do
as
a
wife
and
i
shall
certainly
make
a
better
husband
than
mountjoy
would
have
done
miss
mountjoy
will
certainly
do
as
a
wife
for
any
one
who
may
be
lucky
enough
to
get
her
said
harry
with
a
certain
tone
of
magnificence
which
at
the
moment
he
felt
to
be
overstrained
and
ridiculous
oh
yes
one
has
got
to
get
her
as
you
call
it
of
course
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
supposed
to
be
in
the
running
that
is
your
own
lookout
i
can
only
allege
on
my
own
behalf
that
it
has
always
been
considered
to
be
an
old
family
arrangement
that
florence
mountjoy
shall
marry
the
heir
to
tretton
park
i
am
in
that
position
now
and
i
only
throw
it
out
as
a
hint
that
i
may
feel
disposed
to
follow
out
the
family
arrangement
of
course
if
other
things
come
in
the
way
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
come
in
this
last
invitation
was
given
in
consequence
of
a
knock
at
the
door
the
door
was
opened
and
there
entered
a
policeman
in
plain
clothes
named
prodgers
who
seemed
from
his
manner
to
be
well
acquainted
with
augustus
scarborough
the
police
for
some
time
past
had
been
very
busy
on
the
track
of
mountjoy
scarborough
but
had
not
hitherto
succeeded
in
obtaining
any
information
such
activity
as
had
been
displayed
can
not
be
procured
without
expense
and
it
had
been
understood
in
this
case
that
old
scarborough
had
refused
to
furnish
the
means
something
he
had
supplied
at
first
but
had
latterly
declined
even
to
subscribe
to
a
fund
he
was
not
at
all
desirous
he
said
that
his
son
should
be
brought
back
to
the
world
particularly
as
he
had
made
it
evident
by
his
disappearance
that
he
was
anxious
to
keep
out
of
the
way
why
should
i
pay
the
fellows
it
no
business
of
mine
he
had
said
to
his
son
and
from
that
moment
he
had
declined
to
do
more
than
make
up
the
first
subscription
which
had
been
suggested
to
him
but
the
police
had
been
kept
very
busy
and
it
was
known
that
the
funds
had
been
supplied
chiefly
by
tyrrwhit
he
was
a
resolute
and
persistent
man
and
was
determined
to
run
down
mountjoy
scarborough
as
he
called
it
if
money
would
enable
him
to
do
so
it
was
he
who
had
appealed
to
the
squire
for
assistance
in
this
object
and
to
him
the
squire
had
expressed
his
opinion
that
as
his
son
did
not
seem
anxious
to
be
brought
back
he
should
not
interfere
in
the
matter
well
prodgers
what
news
have
you
asked
augustus
there
is
a
man
about
down
in
skye
just
here
and
there
with
nothing
in
particular
to
say
for
himself
what
sort
of
a
looking
fellow
is
he
well
he
light
and
do
come
up
to
the
captain
marks
but
no
knowing
what
disguises
a
fellow
will
put
on
i
do
think
he
got
the
captain
legs
and
a
man
ca
change
his
legs
captain
scarborough
would
not
remain
loitering
about
in
skye
where
he
would
be
known
by
half
the
autumn
tourists
who
saw
him
that
just
what
i
was
saying
to
wilkinson
said
prodgers
wilkinson
seems
to
think
that
a
man
may
be
anybody
as
long
as
nobody
knows
who
he
is
ai
the
captain
said
i
i
afraid
he
got
out
of
england
said
the
captain
brother
there
no
place
where
he
can
be
run
down
like
new
york
or
paris
or
melbourne
and
it
them
they
mostly
go
to
we
wired
all
three
and
a
dozen
other
ports
of
the
kind
we
catches
mostly
if
they
go
abroad
but
when
they
remains
at
home
they
uncommon
troublesome
there
was
a
man
wandering
about
in
county
donegal
we
call
ireland
at
home
because
we
so
much
to
do
with
their
police
since
the
land
league
came
up
but
this
chap
was
only
an
artist
who
could
pay
his
bill
what
do
you
think
about
it
mr
annesley
said
the
policeman
turning
short
round
upon
harry
and
addressing
him
a
question
why
should
the
policeman
even
have
known
his
name
who
i
i
do
think
about
it
at
all
i
have
no
means
of
thinking
about
it
because
you
have
been
so
busy
down
there
at
the
yard
i
thought
that
as
you
was
asking
so
many
questions
you
was
perhaps
interested
in
the
matter
my
friend
annesley
said
augustus
was
acquainted
with
captain
scarborough
as
he
is
with
me
it
did
seem
as
though
he
was
more
than
usually
interested
all
the
same
said
the
policeman
i
am
more
than
usually
interested
replied
harry
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
am
going
to
give
you
my
reason
as
to
his
present
existence
i
know
absolutely
nothing
i
dare
say
not
if
you
any
information
as
was
reliable
i
dare
say
as
it
would
be
forthcoming
well
scarborough
you
may
be
sure
of
this
if
we
can
get
upon
his
trail
we
do
so
and
i
think
we
shall
there
is
a
port
that
has
been
watched
from
two
days
after
his
disappearance
and
there
is
a
port
as
wo
be
watched
as
soon
as
any
english
steamer
touches
we
got
our
eyes
out
and
we
means
to
use
scarborough
annesley
and
he
bobbed
his
head
to
our
friend
harry
you
say
as
there
is
a
reason
as
is
unknown
perhaps
it
wo
be
unknown
always
gentlemen
then
constable
prodgers
left
the
room
harry
had
been
disconcerted
by
the
policeman
remarks
and
showed
that
it
was
so
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
augustus
scarborough
i
afraid
you
think
the
man
intended
to
be
impertinent
said
augustus
no
doubt
he
did
but
such
men
are
allowed
to
be
impertinent
he
sees
an
enemy
of
course
in
every
one
who
pretends
to
know
more
than
he
knows
himself
or
indeed
in
every
one
who
does
not
you
said
something
about
having
a
reason
of
your
own
and
he
at
once
connected
you
with
mountjoy
disappearance
such
creatures
are
necessary
but
from
the
little
i
seen
of
them
i
do
not
think
that
they
make
the
best
companions
in
the
world
i
shall
leave
prodgers
to
carry
on
his
business
to
the
man
who
employs
him
namely
tyrrwhit
and
i
advise
you
to
do
the
same
soon
after
that
harry
annesley
took
his
leave
but
he
could
not
divest
himself
of
an
opinion
that
both
the
policeman
and
his
host
had
thought
that
he
had
some
knowledge
respecting
the
missing
man
augustus
scarborough
had
said
no
word
to
that
effect
but
there
had
been
a
something
in
his
manner
which
had
excited
suspicion
in
harry
mind
and
then
augustus
had
declared
his
purpose
of
offering
his
hand
and
fortune
to
florence
mountjoy
he
to
be
suitor
to
florence
he
so
soon
after
mountjoy
had
been
banished
from
the
scene
and
why
should
he
have
been
told
of
it
he
of
whose
love
for
the
girl
he
could
not
but
think
that
augustus
scarborough
had
been
aware
then
much
perturbed
in
his
mind
he
resolved
as
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
that
he
would
go
down
to
cheltenham
on
the
following
day
chapter
vi
harry
annesley
tells
his
secret
harry
hurried
down
to
cheltenham
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
going
to
do
or
say
when
he
got
there
he
went
to
the
hotel
and
dined
alone
all
this
that
up
about
captain
mountjoy
said
a
stranger
coming
and
whispering
to
him
at
his
table
the
inquirer
was
almost
a
stranger
but
harry
did
know
his
name
it
was
baskerville
the
hunting
man
baskerville
was
not
rich
and
not
especially
popular
and
had
no
special
amusement
but
that
of
riding
two
nags
in
the
winter
along
the
roads
of
cheltenham
in
the
direction
which
the
hounds
took
it
was
still
summer
and
the
nags
who
had
been
made
to
do
their
work
in
london
were
picking
up
a
little
strength
in
idleness
or
as
baskerville
called
it
getting
into
condition
in
the
mean
time
baskerville
amused
himself
as
well
as
he
could
by
lying
in
bed
and
playing
he
sometimes
dined
at
the
hotel
in
order
that
the
club
might
think
that
he
was
entertained
at
friends
houses
but
the
two
places
were
nearly
the
same
to
him
as
he
could
achieve
a
dinner
and
half
a
pint
of
wine
for
five
or
six
shillings
at
each
of
them
a
more
empty
existence
or
one
would
be
inclined
to
say
less
pleasurable
no
one
could
pass
but
he
had
always
a
decent
coat
on
his
back
and
a
smile
on
his
face
and
five
shillings
in
his
pocket
with
which
to
pay
for
his
dinner
his
asking
what
was
up
about
scarborough
showed
at
any
rate
that
he
was
very
backward
in
the
world
news
i
believe
he
has
vanished
said
harry
oh
yes
of
course
he
vanished
everybody
knows
that
he
vanished
ever
so
long
ago
but
where
is
he
if
you
can
tell
them
in
scotland
yard
they
will
be
obliged
to
you
i
suppose
it
is
true
the
police
are
after
him
dear
me
forty
thousand
a
year
this
is
a
very
queer
story
about
the
property
is
it
i
do
know
the
story
exactly
and
therefore
can
hardly
say
whether
it
is
queer
or
not
but
about
the
younger
son
people
say
that
the
father
has
contrived
that
the
younger
son
shall
have
the
money
what
i
hear
is
that
the
whole
property
is
to
be
divided
and
that
the
captain
is
to
have
half
on
conditions
that
he
keeps
out
of
the
way
but
i
am
sure
that
you
know
more
about
it
you
used
to
be
intimate
with
both
the
brothers
i
have
seen
you
down
here
with
the
captain
where
is
he
and
again
he
whispered
into
harry
ear
but
he
could
not
have
selected
any
subject
more
distasteful
and
therefore
harry
repulsed
baskerville
not
in
the
most
courteous
manner
hang
it
what
airs
that
fellow
gives
himself
he
said
to
another
friend
of
the
same
kidney
that
young
annesley
the
son
of
a
parson
down
in
hertfordshire
the
kind
of
ways
these
fellows
put
on
now
are
unbearable
he
has
got
a
horse
to
ride
on
but
to
hear
him
talk
you
think
he
was
mounted
three
days
a
week
he
heir
to
old
prosper
of
buston
hall
how
that
but
is
he
i
never
heard
that
before
what
buston
hall
worth
then
baskerville
made
up
his
mind
to
be
doubly
civil
to
harry
annesley
the
next
time
he
saw
him
harry
had
to
consider
on
that
night
in
what
manner
he
would
endeavor
to
see
florence
mountjoy
on
the
next
day
he
was
thoroughly
discontented
with
himself
as
he
walked
about
the
streets
of
cheltenham
he
had
now
not
only
allowed
the
disappearance
of
scarborough
to
pass
by
without
stating
when
and
where
and
how
he
had
last
seen
him
but
had
directly
lied
on
the
subject
he
had
told
the
man
brother
that
he
had
not
seen
him
for
some
weeks
previous
whereas
to
have
concealed
his
knowledge
on
such
a
subject
was
in
itself
held
to
be
abominable
he
was
ashamed
of
himself
and
the
more
so
because
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
could
talk
openly
on
the
matter
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
all
whom
he
met
questioned
him
as
to
the
man
disappearance
as
if
they
suspected
him
what
was
the
man
to
him
or
the
man
guilt
or
his
father
that
he
should
be
made
miserable
the
man
attack
upon
him
had
been
ferocious
in
its
nature
so
brutal
that
when
he
had
escaped
from
mountjoy
scarborough
clutches
there
was
nothing
for
him
but
to
leave
him
lying
in
the
street
where
in
his
drunkenness
he
had
fallen
and
now
in
consequence
of
this
misery
had
fallen
upon
himself
even
this
fellow
baskerville
a
man
the
poverty
of
whose
character
harry
perfectly
understood
had
questioned
him
about
mountjoy
scarborough
it
could
not
he
thought
be
possible
that
baskerville
could
have
had
any
reasons
for
suspicion
and
yet
the
very
sound
of
the
inquiry
stuck
in
his
ears
on
the
next
morning
at
eleven
he
knocked
at
house
in
mountpellier
place
and
asked
for
the
elder
lady
mountjoy
was
out
and
harry
at
once
inquired
for
florence
the
servant
at
first
seemed
to
hesitate
but
at
last
showed
harry
into
the
there
he
waited
five
minutes
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
half
an
hour
and
then
florence
came
to
him
your
mother
is
not
at
home
he
said
putting
out
his
hand
no
annesley
but
i
think
she
will
be
back
soon
will
you
wait
for
her
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
not
glad
that
she
should
be
out
florence
i
have
something
that
i
must
tell
you
something
that
you
must
tell
me
he
had
called
her
florence
once
before
on
a
happy
afternoon
which
he
well
remembered
but
he
was
not
thinking
of
that
now
her
name
which
was
always
in
his
mind
had
come
to
him
naturally
as
though
he
had
no
time
to
pick
and
choose
about
names
in
the
importance
of
the
communication
which
he
had
to
make
yes
i
do
believe
that
you
were
ever
really
engaged
to
your
cousin
mountjoy
no
i
never
was
she
answered
briskly
harry
annesley
was
certainly
a
handsome
man
but
no
young
man
living
ever
thought
less
of
his
own
beauty
he
had
fair
wavy
hair
which
he
was
always
submitting
to
some
barber
very
much
to
the
unexpressed
disgust
of
poor
florence
because
to
her
eyes
the
longer
the
hair
grew
the
more
beautiful
was
the
wearer
of
it
his
forehead
and
eyes
and
nose
were
all
perfect
in
their
form
hyperion
curls
the
front
of
jove
himself
an
eye
like
mars
to
threaten
and
command
there
was
a
peculiar
brightness
in
his
eye
which
would
have
seemed
to
denote
something
absolutely
great
in
his
character
had
it
not
been
for
the
wavering
indecision
of
his
mouth
there
was
as
it
were
a
vacillation
in
his
lips
which
took
away
from
the
manliness
of
his
physiognomy
florence
who
regarded
his
face
as
almost
divine
was
yet
conscious
of
some
weakness
about
his
mouth
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
interpret
but
yet
without
knowing
why
it
was
so
she
was
accustomed
to
expect
from
him
doubtful
words
half
expressed
words
which
would
not
declare
to
her
his
perfected
thoughts
as
she
would
have
them
declared
he
was
six
feet
high
but
neither
broad
nor
narrow
nor
fat
nor
thin
but
a
very
apollo
in
florence
eye
to
the
elders
who
knew
him
the
quintessence
of
his
beauty
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
altogether
unconscious
of
it
he
was
a
man
who
counted
nothing
on
his
personal
appearance
for
the
performance
of
those
deeds
which
he
was
most
anxious
to
achieve
the
one
achievement
now
essentially
necessary
to
his
happiness
was
the
possession
of
florence
mountjoy
but
it
certainly
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
more
likely
to
obtain
this
because
he
was
six
feet
high
or
because
his
hair
waved
becomingly
i
have
supposed
so
he
said
in
answer
to
her
last
assertion
you
ought
to
have
known
it
for
certain
i
mean
to
say
that
had
i
ever
been
engaged
to
my
cousin
i
should
have
been
miserable
at
such
a
moment
as
this
i
never
should
have
given
him
up
because
of
the
gross
injustice
done
to
him
about
the
property
but
his
disappearance
in
this
dreadful
way
would
i
think
have
killed
me
as
it
is
i
can
think
of
nothing
else
because
he
is
my
cousin
it
is
very
dreadful
said
harry
have
you
any
idea
what
can
have
happened
to
him
not
in
the
least
have
you
none
at
all
but
but
what
i
was
the
last
person
who
saw
him
you
saw
him
last
at
least
i
know
no
one
who
saw
him
after
me
have
you
told
them
i
have
told
no
one
but
you
i
have
come
down
here
to
cheltenham
on
purpose
to
tell
you
why
me
she
said
as
though
struck
with
fear
at
such
an
assertion
on
his
part
i
must
tell
some
one
and
i
have
not
known
whom
else
to
tell
his
father
appears
not
at
all
anxious
about
him
his
brother
i
do
not
altogether
trust
were
i
to
go
to
these
men
who
are
only
looking
after
their
money
i
should
be
communicating
with
his
enemies
your
mother
already
regards
me
as
his
enemy
if
i
told
the
police
i
should
simply
be
brought
into
a
court
of
justice
where
i
should
be
compelled
to
mention
your
name
why
mine
i
must
begin
the
story
from
the
beginning
one
night
i
was
coming
home
in
london
very
late
about
two
when
whom
should
i
meet
in
the
street
suddenly
but
mountjoy
scarborough
it
came
out
afterward
that
he
had
then
been
gambling
but
when
he
encountered
me
he
was
intoxicated
he
took
me
suddenly
by
the
collar
and
shook
me
violently
and
did
his
best
to
maltreat
me
what
words
were
spoken
i
can
not
remember
but
his
conduct
to
me
was
as
that
of
a
savage
beast
i
struggled
with
him
in
the
street
as
a
man
would
struggle
who
is
attacked
by
a
wild
dog
i
think
that
he
did
not
explain
the
cause
of
his
hatred
though
of
course
my
memory
as
to
what
took
place
at
that
moment
is
disturbed
and
imperfect
but
i
did
know
in
my
heart
why
it
was
that
he
had
quarrelled
with
me
why
was
it
florence
asked
because
he
thought
that
i
had
ventured
to
love
you
no
no
shrieked
florence
he
could
not
have
thought
that
he
did
think
so
and
he
was
right
enough
if
i
have
never
said
so
before
i
am
bound
at
any
rate
to
say
it
now
he
paused
for
a
moment
but
she
made
him
no
answer
in
the
struggle
between
us
he
fell
on
the
pavement
against
a
rail
and
then
i
left
him
well
he
has
never
been
heard
of
since
on
the
following
day
in
the
afternoon
i
left
london
for
buston
but
nothing
had
been
then
heard
of
his
disappearance
i
neither
knew
of
it
nor
suspected
it
the
question
is
when
others
were
searching
for
him
was
i
bound
to
go
to
the
police
and
declare
what
i
had
suffered
from
him
that
night
why
should
i
connect
his
going
with
the
outrage
which
i
had
suffered
but
why
not
tell
it
all
i
should
have
been
asked
why
he
had
quarrelled
with
me
ought
i
to
have
said
that
i
did
not
know
ought
i
to
have
pretended
that
there
was
no
cause
i
did
know
and
there
was
a
cause
it
was
because
he
thought
that
i
might
prevail
with
you
now
that
he
was
a
beggar
disowned
by
his
own
father
i
would
never
have
given
him
up
for
that
said
florence
but
do
you
not
see
that
your
name
would
have
been
brought
in
that
i
should
have
had
to
speak
of
you
as
though
i
thought
it
possible
that
you
loved
me
then
he
paused
and
florence
sat
silent
but
another
thought
struck
him
now
it
occurred
to
him
that
under
the
plea
put
forward
he
would
appear
to
seek
shelter
from
his
silence
as
to
her
name
he
was
aware
how
anxious
he
was
on
his
own
behalf
not
to
mention
the
occurrence
in
the
street
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
attempting
to
escape
under
the
pretence
of
a
fear
that
her
name
would
be
dragged
in
but
independently
of
that
i
do
not
see
why
i
should
be
subjected
to
the
annoyance
of
letting
it
be
known
that
i
was
thus
attacked
in
the
streets
and
the
time
has
now
gone
by
it
did
not
occur
to
me
when
first
he
was
missed
that
the
matter
would
have
been
of
such
importance
now
it
is
too
late
i
suppose
that
you
ought
to
have
told
his
father
i
think
that
i
ought
to
have
done
so
but
at
any
rate
i
have
come
to
explain
it
all
to
you
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
tell
some
one
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
man
has
been
killed
oh
i
hope
not
i
hope
not
that
he
has
been
spirited
away
out
of
the
way
of
his
creditors
for
myself
i
think
that
it
has
all
been
done
with
his
father
connivance
whether
his
brother
be
in
the
secret
or
not
i
can
not
tell
but
i
suspect
he
is
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
that
captain
scarborough
himself
has
run
so
overhead
into
debt
as
to
make
the
payment
of
his
creditors
impossible
by
anything
short
of
the
immediate
surrender
of
the
whole
property
some
month
or
two
since
they
all
thought
that
the
squire
was
dying
and
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
but
to
sell
the
property
which
would
then
be
mountjoy
and
pay
themselves
against
this
the
dying
man
has
rebelled
and
has
come
as
it
were
out
of
the
grave
to
disinherit
the
son
who
has
already
contrived
to
disinherit
himself
it
is
all
an
effort
to
save
tretton
but
it
is
dishonest
said
florence
no
doubt
about
it
looking
at
it
any
way
it
is
dishonest
either
the
inheritance
must
belong
to
mountjoy
still
or
it
could
not
have
been
his
when
he
was
allowed
to
borrow
money
upon
it
i
can
not
understand
it
i
thought
it
was
entailed
upon
him
of
course
it
is
nothing
to
me
it
never
could
have
been
anything
but
now
the
creditors
declare
that
they
have
been
cheated
and
assert
that
mountjoy
is
being
kept
out
of
the
way
to
aid
old
scarborough
in
the
fraud
i
can
not
but
say
that
i
think
it
is
so
but
why
he
should
have
attacked
me
just
at
the
moment
of
his
going
or
why
rather
he
should
have
gone
immediately
after
he
had
attacked
me
i
can
not
say
i
have
no
concern
whatever
with
him
or
his
money
though
i
hope
i
hope
that
i
may
always
have
much
with
you
oh
florence
you
surely
have
known
what
has
been
within
my
heart
to
this
appeal
she
made
no
response
but
sat
awhile
considering
what
she
would
say
respecting
mountjoy
scarborough
and
his
affairs
am
i
to
keep
all
this
a
secret
she
asked
him
at
last
you
shall
consider
that
for
yourself
i
have
not
exacted
from
you
any
silence
on
the
matter
you
may
tell
whom
you
please
and
i
shall
not
consider
that
i
have
any
ground
of
complaint
against
you
of
course
for
my
own
sake
i
do
not
wish
it
to
be
told
a
great
injury
was
done
me
and
i
do
not
desire
to
be
dragged
into
this
which
would
be
another
injury
i
suspect
that
augustus
scarborough
knows
more
than
he
pretends
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
brought
into
the
mess
by
his
cunning
whether
you
will
tell
your
mother
you
must
judge
yourself
i
shall
tell
nobody
unless
you
bid
me
at
that
moment
the
door
of
the
room
was
opened
and
mountjoy
entered
with
a
frown
upon
her
brow
she
had
not
yet
given
up
all
hope
that
mountjoy
might
return
and
that
the
affairs
of
tretton
might
be
made
to
straighten
themselves
mamma
annesley
is
here
so
i
perceive
my
dear
i
have
come
to
your
daughter
to
tell
her
how
dearly
i
love
her
said
harry
boldly
annesley
you
should
have
come
to
me
before
speaking
to
my
daughter
then
i
should
have
seen
her
at
all
you
should
have
left
that
as
it
might
be
it
is
not
at
all
a
proper
thing
that
a
young
gentleman
should
come
and
address
a
young
lady
in
this
way
behind
her
only
parent
back
i
asked
for
you
and
i
did
not
know
that
you
would
not
be
at
home
you
should
have
gone
away
at
once
at
once
you
know
how
terribly
the
family
is
cut
up
by
this
great
misfortune
to
our
cousin
mountjoy
mountjoy
scarborough
has
been
long
engaged
to
florence
no
mamma
no
never
at
any
rate
annesley
knows
all
about
it
and
that
knowledge
ought
to
have
kept
him
away
at
the
present
moment
i
must
beg
him
to
leave
us
now
then
harry
took
his
hat
and
departed
but
he
had
great
consolation
in
feeling
that
florence
had
not
repudiated
his
love
which
she
certainly
would
have
done
had
she
not
loved
him
in
return
she
had
spoken
no
word
of
absolute
encouragement
but
there
had
much
more
of
encouragement
than
of
repudiation
in
her
manner
chapter
vii
harry
annesley
goes
to
tretton
harry
had
promised
to
go
down
to
tretton
and
when
the
time
came
augustus
scarborough
did
not
allow
him
to
escape
from
the
visit
he
explained
to
him
that
in
his
father
state
of
health
there
would
be
no
company
to
entertain
him
that
there
was
only
a
maiden
sister
of
his
father
staying
in
the
house
and
that
he
intended
to
take
down
into
the
country
with
him
one
septimus
jones
who
occupied
chambers
on
the
same
floor
with
him
in
london
and
whom
annesley
knew
to
be
young
scarborough
most
intimate
friend
there
will
be
a
little
shooting
he
said
and
i
have
bought
two
or
three
horses
which
you
and
jones
can
ride
cannock
chase
is
one
of
the
prettiest
parts
of
england
and
as
you
care
for
scenery
you
can
get
some
amusement
out
of
that
you
see
my
father
and
hear
no
doubt
what
he
has
got
to
say
for
himself
he
is
not
in
the
least
reticent
in
speaking
of
my
brother
affairs
there
was
a
good
deal
in
this
which
was
not
agreeable
miss
scarborough
was
sister
to
mountjoy
as
well
as
to
the
squire
and
had
been
one
of
the
family
party
most
anxious
to
assure
the
marriage
of
florence
and
the
captain
the
late
general
mountjoy
had
been
supposed
to
be
a
great
man
in
his
way
but
had
died
before
tretton
had
become
as
valuable
as
it
was
now
hence
the
eldest
son
had
been
christened
with
his
name
and
much
of
the
mountjoy
prestige
still
clung
to
the
family
but
harry
did
not
care
much
about
the
family
except
so
far
as
florence
was
concerned
and
then
he
had
not
been
on
peculiarly
friendly
terms
with
septimus
jones
who
had
always
been
submissive
to
augustus
and
now
that
augustus
was
a
rich
man
and
could
afford
to
buy
horses
was
likely
to
be
more
submissive
than
ever
he
went
down
to
tretton
alone
early
in
september
and
when
he
reached
the
house
he
found
that
the
two
young
men
were
out
shooting
he
asked
for
his
own
room
but
was
instead
immediately
taken
to
the
old
squire
whom
he
found
lying
on
a
couch
in
a
small
while
his
sister
who
had
been
reading
to
him
was
by
his
side
after
the
usual
greetings
harry
made
some
awkward
apology
as
to
his
intrusion
at
the
sick
man
bedside
why
i
ordered
them
to
bring
you
in
here
said
the
squire
you
ca
very
well
call
that
intrusion
i
have
no
idea
of
being
shut
up
from
the
world
before
they
nail
me
down
in
my
coffin
that
will
be
a
long
time
first
we
all
hope
said
his
sister
bother
you
hope
it
but
i
do
know
that
any
one
else
does
i
for
one
and
if
i
did
what
the
good
of
hoping
i
have
a
couple
of
diseases
either
of
which
is
enough
to
kill
a
horse
then
he
mentioned
his
special
maladies
in
a
manner
which
made
harry
shrink
what
are
they
talking
about
in
london
just
at
present
he
asked
just
the
old
set
of
subjects
said
harry
i
suppose
they
have
got
tired
of
me
and
my
iniquities
harry
could
only
smile
and
shake
his
head
there
has
been
such
a
complication
of
romances
that
one
expects
the
story
to
run
a
little
more
than
the
ordinary
nine
days
men
still
do
talk
about
mountjoy
and
what
are
they
saying
augustus
declares
that
you
are
especially
interested
on
the
subject
i
do
know
why
i
should
be
said
harry
nor
i
either
when
a
fellow
becomes
no
longer
of
any
service
to
either
man
woman
or
beast
i
do
not
know
why
any
should
take
an
interest
in
him
i
suppose
you
did
lend
him
money
i
was
not
likely
to
do
that
sir
then
i
can
not
conceive
how
it
can
interest
you
whether
he
be
in
london
or
kamtchatka
it
does
not
interest
me
the
least
in
the
world
were
he
to
turn
up
here
it
would
be
a
trouble
and
yet
they
expect
me
to
subscribe
largely
to
a
fund
for
finding
him
what
good
could
he
do
me
if
he
were
found
oh
john
he
is
your
son
said
miss
scarborough
and
would
be
just
as
good
a
son
as
augustus
only
that
he
has
turned
out
uncommonly
badly
i
have
not
the
slightest
feeling
in
the
world
as
to
his
birth
and
so
i
think
i
showed
pretty
plainly
but
nothing
could
stop
him
in
his
course
and
therefore
i
told
the
truth
that
all
in
answer
to
this
harry
found
it
quite
impossible
to
say
a
word
but
got
away
to
his
bedroom
and
dressed
for
dinner
as
quickly
as
possible
while
he
was
still
thus
employed
augustus
came
into
the
room
still
dressed
in
his
so
you
seen
my
father
he
said
yes
i
saw
him
and
what
did
he
say
to
you
about
mountjoy
little
or
nothing
that
signifies
he
seems
to
think
it
unreasonable
that
he
should
be
asked
to
pay
for
finding
him
seeing
that
the
creditors
expect
to
get
the
advantage
of
his
presence
when
found
he
is
about
right
there
oh
yes
but
still
he
is
his
father
it
may
be
that
it
would
be
expected
that
he
should
interest
himself
in
finding
him
upon
my
word
i
do
agree
with
you
if
a
thousand
a
year
could
be
paid
to
keep
mountjoy
out
of
the
way
i
think
it
would
be
well
expended
but
you
were
acting
with
the
police
oh
the
police
what
do
the
police
know
about
it
of
course
i
talk
it
all
over
with
them
they
have
not
the
smallest
idea
where
the
man
is
and
do
not
know
how
to
go
to
work
to
discover
him
i
do
say
that
my
father
is
judicious
in
his
opposition
to
all
inquiry
he
should
pretend
to
be
a
little
anxious
as
i
do
not
that
there
would
be
any
use
now
in
pretending
to
keep
up
appearances
he
has
declared
himself
utterly
indifferent
to
the
law
and
has
defied
the
world
never
mind
old
fellow
we
shall
eat
the
more
dinner
only
i
must
go
and
prepare
myself
for
it
at
dinner
harry
found
only
septimus
jones
augustus
scarborough
and
his
aunt
miss
scarborough
said
a
good
deal
about
her
brother
and
declared
him
to
be
much
better
of
course
you
know
augustus
that
sir
william
brodrick
was
down
here
for
two
days
only
fancy
replied
he
what
one
has
to
pay
for
two
days
of
sir
william
brodrick
in
the
country
what
can
it
matter
said
the
generous
spinster
it
matters
exactly
so
many
hundred
pounds
but
no
one
will
begrudge
it
if
he
does
so
many
hundred
pounds
worth
of
good
it
will
show
at
any
rate
that
we
have
had
the
best
advice
said
the
lady
yes
it
will
show
that
is
exactly
what
people
care
about
what
did
sir
william
say
then
during
the
first
half
of
dinner
a
prolonged
reference
was
made
to
scarborough
maladies
and
to
sir
william
opinion
concerning
them
sir
william
had
declared
that
constitution
was
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
he
had
ever
met
in
his
experience
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
scarborough
body
was
one
mass
of
cuts
and
bruises
and
faulty
places
and
that
nothing
would
keep
him
going
except
the
wearing
of
machinery
which
he
was
unwilling
to
wear
yet
the
facilities
for
much
personal
enjoyment
were
left
to
him
and
sir
william
declared
that
if
he
would
only
do
exactly
as
he
were
told
he
might
live
for
the
next
five
years
but
everybody
knows
that
he
wo
do
anything
that
he
is
told
said
augustus
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
by
no
means
expressed
extreme
sorrow
from
his
father
he
led
the
conversation
to
the
partridges
and
declared
his
conviction
that
with
a
little
trouble
and
some
expense
a
very
good
head
of
game
might
be
got
up
at
tretton
i
suppose
it
would
cost
much
said
jones
who
beyond
ten
shillings
to
a
never
paid
sixpence
for
whatever
shooting
came
in
his
way
i
do
know
what
you
call
much
said
augustus
but
i
think
it
may
be
done
for
three
or
four
hundred
a
year
i
should
like
to
calculate
how
many
thousand
partridges
at
that
rate
sir
william
has
taken
back
in
his
pocket
what
does
it
matter
asked
miss
scarborough
only
as
a
speculation
of
course
my
father
while
he
lives
is
justified
in
giving
his
whole
income
to
doctors
if
he
likes
it
but
one
gets
into
a
manner
of
speaking
about
him
as
though
he
had
done
a
good
deal
with
his
money
in
which
he
was
not
justified
do
talk
in
that
way
augustus
my
dear
aunt
i
am
not
at
all
inclined
to
be
more
than
he
is
only
reflect
what
it
was
that
he
was
disposed
to
do
with
me
and
the
with
which
i
have
borne
it
i
think
i
should
hold
my
tongue
about
it
said
harry
annesley
and
i
think
that
in
my
place
you
would
do
no
such
thing
to
your
nature
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
hold
your
tongue
your
sense
of
justice
would
be
so
affronted
that
you
would
feel
yourself
compelled
to
discuss
the
injury
done
to
you
with
all
your
intimate
friends
but
with
your
father
your
quarrel
would
be
eternal
i
made
nothing
of
it
and
indeed
if
he
pertinaciously
held
his
tongue
on
the
subject
so
should
i
but
because
he
talks
said
harry
why
should
you
why
should
he
not
said
septimus
jones
upon
my
word
i
do
see
the
justice
of
it
i
am
not
speaking
of
justice
but
of
feeling
upon
my
word
i
wish
you
would
hold
your
tongues
about
it
at
any
rate
till
my
back
is
turned
said
the
old
lady
then
augustus
finished
the
conversation
i
am
determined
to
treat
it
all
as
though
it
were
a
joke
and
as
a
joke
one
to
be
spoken
of
lightly
it
was
a
strong
measure
certainly
this
attempt
to
rob
me
of
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
pounds
a
year
but
it
was
done
in
favor
of
my
brother
and
therefore
let
it
pass
i
am
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
my
father
has
done
with
his
money
he
has
given
mountjoy
at
any
rate
more
than
a
half
of
his
income
for
the
last
five
or
six
years
and
his
own
personal
expenses
are
very
small
yet
he
tells
me
that
he
has
the
greatest
difficulty
in
raising
a
thousand
pounds
and
positively
refuses
in
his
present
difficulties
to
add
above
five
hundred
a
year
to
my
former
allowance
no
father
who
had
thoroughly
done
his
duty
by
his
son
could
speak
in
a
more
fixed
and
austere
manner
and
yet
he
knows
that
every
shilling
will
be
mine
as
soon
as
he
goes
the
servant
who
was
waiting
upon
them
had
been
in
and
out
of
the
room
while
this
was
said
and
must
have
heard
much
of
it
but
to
that
augustus
seemed
to
be
quite
indifferent
and
indeed
the
whole
family
story
was
known
to
every
servant
in
the
house
it
is
true
that
gentlemen
and
ladies
who
have
servants
do
not
usually
wish
to
talk
about
their
private
matters
before
all
the
household
even
though
the
private
matters
may
be
known
but
this
household
was
unlike
all
others
in
that
respect
there
was
not
a
housemaid
about
the
rooms
or
a
groom
in
the
stables
who
did
not
know
how
terrible
a
reprobate
their
master
had
been
you
will
see
your
father
before
you
go
to
bed
miss
scarborough
said
to
her
nephew
as
she
left
the
room
certainly
if
he
will
send
to
say
that
he
wishes
it
he
does
wish
it
most
anxiously
i
believe
that
to
be
your
imagination
at
any
rate
i
will
come
say
in
an
hour
time
he
would
be
just
as
pleased
to
see
harry
annesley
for
the
matter
of
that
or
grey
or
the
inspector
of
police
any
one
whom
he
could
shock
or
pretend
to
shock
by
the
peculiarity
of
his
opinions
would
do
as
well
by
that
time
however
miss
scarborough
had
left
the
room
then
the
three
men
sat
and
talked
and
discussed
the
affairs
of
the
family
generally
new
leases
had
just
been
granted
for
adding
manufactories
to
the
town
of
tretton
and
as
far
as
outward
marks
of
prosperity
went
all
was
prosperous
i
expect
to
have
a
on
the
lawn
before
long
said
augustus
these
mechanics
have
it
all
their
own
way
if
they
were
to
come
and
tell
me
that
they
intended
to
put
up
a
in
my
bedroom
morning
i
could
only
take
off
my
hat
to
them
when
a
man
offers
you
five
per
cent
where
you
only
had
four
he
is
instantly
your
lord
and
master
it
does
signify
how
vulgar
he
is
or
how
insolent
or
how
exacting
associations
of
the
tenderest
kind
must
all
give
way
to
trade
but
the
shooting
which
lies
to
the
north
and
west
of
us
is
i
think
safe
for
the
present
i
suppose
i
must
go
and
see
what
my
father
wants
or
i
shall
be
held
to
have
neglected
my
duty
to
my
affectionate
parent
capital
fellow
augustus
scarborough
said
jones
as
soon
as
their
host
had
left
them
i
was
at
cambridge
with
him
and
he
was
popular
there
he
be
more
popular
now
that
he
the
heir
to
tretton
i
do
know
any
fellow
that
i
can
get
along
better
with
than
scarborough
i
think
you
were
a
little
hard
upon
him
about
his
father
you
know
in
his
position
he
ought
to
hold
his
tongue
it
the
strangest
thing
that
has
turned
up
in
the
whole
course
of
my
experience
you
see
if
he
did
talk
about
it
people
would
quite
understand
what
it
was
that
his
father
has
done
it
only
matter
of
report
now
and
the
creditors
no
doubt
do
believe
that
when
old
scarborough
goes
off
the
hooks
they
will
be
able
to
walk
in
and
take
possession
he
has
got
to
make
the
world
think
that
he
is
the
heir
and
that
will
go
a
long
way
you
may
be
sure
he
does
talk
as
he
does
without
having
a
reason
for
it
he
the
last
man
i
know
to
do
anything
without
a
reason
the
evening
dragged
along
very
slowly
while
jones
continued
to
tell
all
that
he
knew
of
his
friend
character
but
augustus
scarborough
did
not
return
and
soon
after
ten
when
harry
annesley
could
smoke
no
more
cigars
and
declared
that
he
had
no
wish
to
begin
upon
after
his
wine
he
went
to
his
bed
chapter
viii
harry
annesley
takes
a
walk
there
was
the
devil
to
pay
with
my
father
last
night
after
i
went
to
him
said
scarborough
to
harry
next
morning
he
now
and
then
suffers
agonies
of
pain
and
it
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
get
him
right
again
but
anything
equal
to
his
courage
i
never
before
met
how
is
he
this
morning
very
weak
and
unable
to
exert
himself
but
i
can
not
say
that
he
is
otherwise
much
the
worse
you
wo
see
him
this
morning
but
you
will
or
next
day
do
you
be
shy
about
going
to
him
when
he
sends
for
you
he
likes
to
show
the
world
that
he
can
bear
his
sufferings
with
a
light
heart
and
is
ready
to
die
without
a
pang
or
a
regret
who
was
the
fellow
who
sent
for
a
fellow
to
let
him
see
how
a
christian
could
die
i
can
fancy
my
father
doing
the
same
thing
only
there
would
be
nothing
about
christianity
in
the
message
he
would
bid
you
come
and
see
a
pagan
depart
in
peace
and
would
be
very
unhappy
if
he
thought
that
your
dinner
would
be
disturbed
by
the
ceremony
now
come
down
to
breakfast
and
then
we
go
out
shooting
for
three
days
harry
remained
at
tretton
and
ate
and
drank
and
shot
and
rode
always
in
young
scarborough
company
during
this
time
he
did
not
see
the
old
squire
and
understood
from
miss
scarborough
absence
that
he
was
still
suffering
from
his
late
attack
the
visit
was
to
be
prolonged
for
one
other
day
and
he
was
told
that
on
that
day
the
squire
would
send
for
him
i
sick
of
these
eternal
partridges
said
augustus
no
man
should
ever
shoot
partridges
two
days
running
jones
can
go
out
by
himself
he
wo
have
to
tip
the
any
more
for
an
additional
day
and
so
it
will
be
all
gain
to
him
you
see
my
father
in
the
afternoon
after
lunch
and
we
will
go
and
take
a
walk
now
harry
started
for
his
walk
and
his
companion
immediately
began
again
about
the
property
i
beginning
to
think
said
he
that
it
nearly
all
up
with
the
governor
these
attacks
come
upon
him
worse
and
worse
and
always
leave
him
absolutely
prostrate
then
he
will
do
nothing
to
prevent
them
to
assure
himself
a
week
of
life
he
will
not
endure
an
hour
of
discomfort
it
is
plucky
you
know
he
is
in
all
respects
as
brave
a
man
as
i
have
known
he
sets
god
and
man
at
absolute
defiance
and
always
does
it
with
the
most
profound
courtesy
if
he
goes
to
the
infernal
regions
he
will
insist
upon
being
the
last
of
the
company
to
enter
the
door
and
he
will
be
prepared
with
something
to
say
as
soon
as
he
has
been
ushered
in
he
was
very
much
troubled
about
you
yesterday
what
has
he
to
say
of
me
nothing
in
the
least
uncivil
but
he
has
an
idea
in
his
head
which
nothing
on
earth
will
put
out
of
it
and
in
which
but
for
your
own
word
i
should
be
inclined
to
agree
harry
when
this
was
said
stood
still
on
the
and
looked
full
into
his
companion
face
he
felt
at
the
moment
that
the
idea
had
some
reference
to
mountjoy
scarborough
and
his
disappearance
they
were
together
on
the
heathy
unenclosed
ground
of
cannock
chase
and
had
already
walked
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
he
thinks
you
know
where
mountjoy
is
why
should
i
know
or
at
any
rate
that
you
have
seen
him
since
any
of
us
he
professes
not
to
care
a
straw
for
mountjoy
or
his
whereabouts
and
declares
himself
under
obligation
to
those
who
have
contrived
his
departure
nevertheless
he
is
curious
what
have
i
to
do
with
mountjoy
scarborough
that
just
the
question
what
have
you
to
do
with
him
he
suggests
that
there
have
been
words
between
you
as
to
florence
which
has
caused
mountjoy
to
vanish
i
do
profess
to
explain
anything
beyond
that
nor
indeed
do
i
profess
to
agree
with
my
father
but
the
odd
thing
is
that
prodgers
the
policeman
has
the
same
thing
running
in
his
head
because
i
have
shown
some
anxiety
about
your
brother
in
scotland
yard
no
doubt
prodgers
says
that
you
shown
more
anxiety
than
was
to
be
expected
from
a
mere
acquaintance
i
quite
acknowledge
that
prodgers
is
as
an
idiot
as
you
shall
catch
on
a
summer
day
but
that
his
opinion
for
myself
i
know
your
word
too
well
to
doubt
it
harry
walked
on
in
silence
thinking
or
trying
to
think
what
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
he
had
better
do
he
was
minded
to
speak
out
the
whole
truth
and
declare
to
himself
that
it
was
nothing
to
him
what
augustus
scarborough
might
say
or
think
and
there
was
present
to
him
a
feeling
that
his
companion
was
dealing
unfairly
with
him
and
was
endeavoring
in
some
way
to
trap
him
and
lead
him
into
a
difficulty
but
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
it
were
not
to
know
anything
of
mountjoy
scarborough
and
to
let
those
five
minutes
in
the
street
be
as
though
they
had
never
been
he
had
been
brutally
attacked
and
had
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
on
the
subject
he
would
not
allow
his
secret
such
as
it
was
to
be
wormed
out
of
him
scarborough
was
endeavoring
to
extort
from
him
that
which
he
had
resolved
to
conceal
and
he
determined
at
last
that
he
would
not
become
a
puppet
in
his
hands
i
do
see
why
you
should
care
a
straw
about
it
said
scarborough
nor
do
i
at
any
rate
you
repeat
your
denial
it
will
be
well
that
i
should
let
my
father
know
that
he
is
mistaken
and
also
that
ass
prodgers
of
course
with
my
father
it
is
sheer
curiosity
indeed
if
he
thought
that
you
were
keeping
mountjoy
under
lock
and
key
he
would
only
admire
your
dexterity
in
so
preserving
him
any
bold
line
of
action
that
was
contrary
to
the
law
recommends
itself
to
his
approbation
but
prodgers
has
a
lurking
idea
that
he
should
like
to
arrest
you
what
for
simply
because
he
thinks
you
know
something
that
he
does
know
as
he
a
detective
that
in
his
mind
is
quite
enough
for
arresting
any
man
i
may
as
well
give
him
my
assurance
then
that
he
is
mistaken
why
should
your
assurance
go
for
more
than
mine
give
him
nothing
of
the
kind
i
may
give
him
at
any
rate
my
assurance
that
i
believe
your
word
if
you
do
believe
it
you
can
do
so
but
you
repeat
your
assertion
that
you
saw
nothing
of
mountjoy
just
before
his
disappearance
this
is
an
amount
of
which
i
do
not
take
in
good
part
and
to
which
i
will
not
submit
here
scarborough
affected
to
laugh
loudly
i
know
nothing
of
your
brother
and
care
almost
as
little
he
has
professed
to
admire
a
young
lady
to
whom
i
am
not
indifferent
and
has
i
believe
expressed
a
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
he
is
also
her
cousin
and
the
lady
in
question
has
no
doubt
been
much
interested
about
him
it
is
natural
that
she
should
be
so
quite
natural
seeing
that
she
has
been
engaged
to
him
for
twelve
months
of
that
i
know
nothing
but
my
interest
about
your
brother
has
been
because
of
her
you
can
explain
all
this
about
your
brother
if
you
please
or
can
let
it
alone
but
for
myself
i
decline
to
answer
any
more
questions
if
prodgers
thinks
that
he
can
arrest
me
let
him
come
and
try
the
idea
of
your
flying
into
a
passion
because
i
have
endeavored
to
explain
it
all
to
you
at
any
rate
i
have
your
absolute
denial
and
that
will
enable
me
to
deal
both
with
my
father
and
prodgers
to
this
harry
made
no
answer
and
the
two
young
men
walked
back
to
tretton
together
without
many
more
words
between
them
when
harry
had
been
in
the
house
about
half
an
hour
and
had
already
eaten
his
lunch
somewhat
sulkily
a
message
came
to
him
from
miss
scarborough
requiring
his
presence
he
went
to
her
and
was
told
by
her
that
scarborough
would
now
see
him
he
was
aware
that
scarborough
never
saw
septimus
jones
and
that
there
was
something
peculiar
in
the
sending
of
this
message
to
him
why
should
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
have
but
a
few
weeks
to
live
be
so
anxious
to
see
one
who
was
comparatively
a
stranger
to
him
i
am
so
glad
you
have
come
in
before
dinner
annesley
because
my
brother
is
so
anxious
to
see
you
and
i
am
afraid
you
go
too
early
in
the
morning
then
he
followed
her
and
again
found
scarborough
on
a
couch
in
the
same
room
to
which
he
had
been
first
introduced
i
had
a
sharp
bout
of
it
since
i
saw
you
before
said
the
sick
man
so
we
heard
sir
there
is
no
saying
how
many
or
rather
how
few
bouts
of
this
kind
it
will
take
to
polish
me
off
but
i
think
i
am
entitled
to
some
little
respite
now
the
apothecary
from
tretton
was
here
this
morning
and
i
believe
has
done
me
just
as
much
good
as
sir
william
brodrick
his
charge
will
be
ten
shillings
while
sir
william
demanded
three
hundred
pounds
but
it
would
be
mean
to
go
out
with
no
one
but
the
tretton
apothecary
to
look
after
one
i
suppose
sir
william
knowledge
has
been
of
some
service
his
dexterity
with
his
knife
has
been
of
more
so
you
and
augustus
have
been
quarrelling
about
mountjoy
not
that
i
know
of
he
says
so
and
i
believe
his
word
on
such
a
subject
sooner
than
yours
you
are
likely
to
quarrel
without
knowing
it
and
he
is
not
he
thinks
that
you
know
what
has
become
of
mountjoy
does
he
why
should
he
think
so
when
i
told
him
that
i
know
nothing
i
tell
you
that
i
know
absolutely
nothing
i
am
ignorant
whether
he
is
dead
or
alive
he
is
not
dead
said
the
father
i
suppose
not
but
i
know
nothing
about
him
why
your
second
son
you
mean
my
eldest
according
to
law
or
rather
my
only
son
why
augustus
scarborough
continued
harry
annesley
should
take
upon
himself
to
suspect
that
i
know
aught
of
his
brother
i
can
not
say
he
has
some
story
about
a
policeman
whom
he
professes
to
believe
to
be
ignorant
of
his
own
business
this
policeman
he
says
is
anxious
to
arrest
me
to
make
you
give
evidence
before
a
magistrate
said
his
father
he
did
not
dare
to
tell
me
that
he
suspected
me
himself
there
i
knew
you
had
quarrelled
i
deny
it
altogether
i
have
not
quarrelled
with
augustus
scarborough
he
is
welcome
to
his
suspicions
if
he
chooses
to
entertain
them
i
should
have
liked
him
better
if
he
had
not
brought
me
down
to
tretton
so
as
to
extract
from
me
whatever
he
can
i
shall
be
more
guarded
in
future
in
speaking
of
mountjoy
scarborough
but
to
you
i
give
my
positive
assurance
which
i
do
not
doubt
you
will
believe
that
i
know
nothing
respecting
him
an
honest
indignation
gleamed
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
but
still
there
were
the
signs
of
that
vacillation
about
his
mouth
which
florence
had
been
able
to
read
but
not
to
interpret
yes
said
the
squire
after
a
pause
i
believe
you
you
have
that
kind
of
ingenuity
which
enables
a
man
to
tell
a
lie
and
stick
to
it
i
have
it
a
very
great
gift
if
a
man
be
enabled
to
restrain
his
appetite
for
lying
harry
could
only
smile
when
he
heard
the
confession
only
think
how
i
have
lied
about
mountjoy
and
how
successful
my
lies
might
have
been
but
for
his
own
folly
people
do
judge
you
a
little
harshly
now
said
harry
what
the
odd
i
care
nothing
for
their
judgment
i
endeavored
to
do
justice
to
my
own
child
and
very
nearly
did
it
i
was
very
nearly
successful
in
rectifying
the
gross
injustice
of
the
world
why
should
a
little
delay
in
a
ceremony
in
which
he
had
no
voice
have
robbed
him
of
his
possessions
i
determined
that
he
should
have
tretton
and
i
determined
also
to
make
it
up
to
augustus
by
denying
myself
the
use
of
my
own
wealth
things
have
gone
wrongly
not
by
my
own
folly
i
could
not
prevent
the
mad
career
which
mountjoy
has
run
but
do
you
think
that
i
am
ashamed
because
the
world
knows
what
i
have
done
do
you
suppose
my
will
be
embittered
by
the
remembrance
that
i
have
been
a
liar
not
in
the
least
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
for
my
two
sons
and
in
doing
it
have
denied
myself
many
advantages
how
many
a
man
would
have
spent
his
money
on
himself
thinking
nothing
of
his
boys
and
then
have
gone
to
his
grave
with
all
the
dignity
of
a
steady
christian
father
of
the
two
men
i
prefer
myself
but
i
know
that
i
have
been
a
liar
what
was
harry
annesley
to
say
in
answer
to
such
an
address
as
this
there
was
the
man
stretched
on
his
bed
before
him
haggard
unshaved
pale
and
grizzly
with
a
fire
in
his
eyes
but
weakness
in
his
voice
bold
defiant
and
yet
not
selfish
he
had
lived
through
his
life
with
the
one
strong
resolution
of
setting
the
law
at
defiance
in
reference
to
the
distribution
of
his
property
but
chiefly
because
he
had
thought
the
law
to
be
unjust
then
when
the
accident
of
his
eldest
son
extravagance
had
fallen
upon
him
he
had
endeavored
to
save
his
second
son
and
had
thought
without
the
slightest
remorse
of
the
loss
which
was
to
fall
on
the
creditors
he
had
done
all
this
in
such
a
manner
that
as
far
as
harry
knew
the
law
could
not
touch
him
though
all
the
world
was
aware
of
his
iniquity
and
now
he
lay
boasting
of
what
he
had
done
it
was
necessary
that
harry
should
say
something
as
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
he
lamely
expressed
a
wish
that
scarborough
might
quickly
recover
no
my
dear
fellow
said
the
squire
men
do
not
recover
when
they
are
brought
to
such
straits
as
i
am
in
nor
do
i
wish
it
were
i
to
live
augustus
would
feel
the
second
injustice
to
be
quite
intolerable
his
mind
is
lost
in
amazement
at
what
i
had
contemplated
and
he
feels
that
the
matter
can
only
be
set
right
between
him
and
fortune
by
my
dying
at
once
if
he
were
to
understand
that
i
were
to
live
ten
years
longer
i
think
that
he
would
either
commit
a
murder
or
lose
his
senses
but
there
is
enough
for
both
of
you
said
harry
there
is
no
such
word
in
the
language
as
enough
an
estate
can
have
but
one
owner
and
augustus
is
anxious
to
be
owner
here
i
do
not
blame
him
in
the
least
why
should
he
desire
to
spare
a
father
rights
when
that
father
showed
himself
so
willing
to
sacrifice
his
annesley
i
am
sorry
you
are
going
for
i
like
to
have
some
honest
fellow
to
talk
to
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
because
i
have
done
this
thing
i
am
indifferent
to
what
men
shall
say
of
me
i
wish
them
to
think
me
good
though
i
have
chosen
to
run
counter
to
the
prejudices
of
the
world
then
harry
escaped
from
the
room
and
spent
the
remaining
evening
with
augustus
scarborough
and
septimus
jones
the
conversation
was
devoted
chiefly
to
the
partridges
and
horses
and
was
carried
on
by
septimus
with
severity
toward
harry
and
by
scarborough
with
an
extreme
civility
which
was
the
more
galling
of
the
two
chapter
ix
augustus
has
his
own
doubts
that
an
impertinent
young
puppy
said
septimus
jones
as
soon
as
the
fly
which
was
to
carry
harry
annesley
to
the
station
had
left
the
on
the
following
morning
it
may
be
presumed
that
jones
would
not
thus
have
expressed
himself
unless
his
friend
augustus
scarborough
had
dropped
certain
words
in
conversation
in
regard
to
harry
to
the
same
effect
and
it
may
be
presumed
also
that
augustus
would
not
have
dropped
such
words
without
a
purpose
of
letting
his
friend
know
that
harry
was
to
be
abused
augustus
scarborough
had
made
up
his
mind
looking
at
the
matter
all
round
that
more
was
to
be
got
by
abusing
harry
than
by
praising
him
the
young
man
has
a
good
opinion
of
himself
certainly
he
thinks
himself
to
be
a
deal
better
than
anybody
else
continued
jones
whereas
i
for
one
do
see
it
and
he
has
a
way
with
him
of
pretending
to
be
quite
equal
to
his
companions
let
them
be
who
they
may
which
to
me
is
odious
he
was
down
upon
you
and
down
upon
your
father
of
course
your
father
has
made
a
most
fraudulent
attempt
but
what
the
devil
is
it
to
him
the
other
young
man
made
no
answer
but
only
smiled
the
opinion
expressed
by
jones
as
to
harry
annesley
had
only
been
a
reflex
of
that
felt
by
augustus
scarborough
but
the
reflex
as
is
always
the
case
when
the
is
true
was
correct
scarborough
had
known
harry
annesley
for
a
long
time
as
time
is
counted
in
early
youth
and
had
by
degrees
learned
to
hate
him
thoroughly
he
was
a
little
the
elder
and
had
at
first
thought
to
domineer
over
his
friend
but
the
friend
had
resisted
and
had
struggled
manfully
to
achieve
what
he
considered
an
equality
in
friendship
now
scarborough
you
may
as
well
take
it
once
for
all
that
i
am
not
going
to
be
talked
down
if
you
want
to
talk
a
fellow
down
you
can
go
to
walker
brown
or
green
then
when
you
are
tired
of
the
occupation
you
can
come
back
to
me
it
was
thus
that
annesley
had
been
wont
to
address
his
friend
but
his
friend
had
been
anxious
to
talk
down
this
special
young
man
for
special
purposes
and
had
been
conscious
of
some
weakness
in
the
character
which
he
thought
entitled
him
to
do
so
but
the
weakness
was
not
of
that
nature
and
he
had
failed
then
had
come
the
rivalry
between
mountjoy
and
harry
which
had
seemed
to
augustus
to
be
the
extreme
of
impudence
from
of
old
he
had
been
taught
to
regard
his
brother
mountjoy
as
the
first
of
young
men
among
commoners
the
first
in
prospects
and
the
first
in
rank
and
to
him
florence
mountjoy
had
been
allotted
as
a
bride
how
he
had
himself
learned
first
to
envy
and
then
to
covet
this
allotted
bride
need
not
here
be
told
but
by
degrees
it
had
come
to
pass
that
augustus
had
determined
that
his
spendthrift
brother
should
fall
under
his
own
power
and
that
the
bride
should
be
the
reward
how
it
was
that
two
brothers
so
different
in
character
and
yet
so
alike
in
their
selfishness
should
have
come
to
love
the
same
girl
with
a
true
intensity
of
purpose
and
that
harry
annesley
whose
character
was
essentially
different
and
who
was
in
no
degree
selfish
should
have
loved
her
also
must
be
left
to
explain
itself
as
the
girl
character
shall
be
developed
but
florence
mountjoy
had
now
for
many
months
been
the
cause
of
bitter
dislike
against
poor
harry
in
the
mind
of
augustus
scarborough
he
understood
much
more
clearly
than
his
brother
had
done
who
it
was
that
the
girl
really
preferred
he
was
ever
conscious
too
of
his
own
superiority
falsely
conscious
and
did
feel
that
if
character
were
really
known
no
girl
would
in
truth
prefer
him
he
could
not
quite
see
harry
with
florence
eyes
nor
could
he
see
himself
with
any
other
eyes
but
his
own
then
had
come
the
meeting
between
mountjoy
and
harry
annesley
in
the
street
of
which
he
had
only
such
garbled
account
as
mountjoy
himself
had
given
him
within
half
an
hour
afterward
from
that
story
told
in
the
words
of
a
drunken
man
a
man
drunk
and
bruised
and
bloody
who
clearly
did
not
understand
in
one
minute
the
words
spoken
in
the
last
augustus
did
learn
that
there
had
been
some
great
row
between
his
brother
and
harry
annesley
then
mountjoy
had
disappeared
had
disappeared
as
the
reader
will
have
understood
with
his
and
harry
had
not
come
forward
when
inquiries
were
made
to
declare
what
he
knew
of
the
occurrences
of
that
night
augustus
had
narrowly
watched
his
conduct
in
order
at
first
that
he
might
learn
in
what
condition
his
brother
had
been
left
in
the
street
but
afterward
with
the
purpose
of
ascertaining
why
it
was
that
harry
had
been
so
reticent
then
he
had
allured
harry
on
to
a
direct
lie
and
soon
perceived
that
he
could
afterward
use
the
secret
for
his
own
purpose
i
think
we
shall
have
to
see
what
that
young
man
about
you
know
he
said
afterward
to
septimus
jones
yes
yes
certainly
said
septimus
but
septimus
did
not
quite
understand
why
it
was
that
they
should
have
to
see
what
the
young
man
was
about
between
you
and
me
i
think
he
means
to
interfere
with
me
and
i
do
not
mean
to
stand
his
interference
i
should
think
not
he
must
go
back
to
buston
among
the
bustonians
or
he
and
i
will
have
a
fight
of
it
i
rather
like
a
fight
just
so
when
a
fellow
so
bumptious
as
that
he
ought
to
be
licked
he
has
lied
about
mountjoy
said
augustus
then
jones
waited
to
be
told
how
it
was
that
harry
had
lied
he
was
aware
that
there
was
some
secret
unknown
to
him
and
was
anxious
to
be
informed
was
harry
aware
of
mountjoy
and
if
so
how
had
he
learned
it
why
was
it
that
harry
should
be
acquainted
with
that
which
was
dark
to
all
the
world
besides
jones
was
of
opinion
that
the
squire
knew
all
about
it
and
thought
it
not
improbable
that
the
squire
and
augustus
had
the
secret
in
their
joint
keeping
but
if
so
how
should
harry
annesley
know
anything
about
it
he
has
lied
like
the
very
devil
continued
augustus
after
a
pause
has
he
now
and
i
do
mean
to
spare
him
i
should
think
not
then
there
was
a
pause
at
the
end
of
which
jones
found
himself
driven
to
ask
a
question
how
has
he
lied
augustus
smiled
and
shook
his
head
from
which
the
other
man
gathered
that
he
was
not
now
to
be
told
the
nature
of
the
lie
in
question
a
fellow
that
lies
like
that
said
jones
is
not
to
be
endured
i
do
not
mean
to
endure
him
you
have
heard
of
a
young
lady
named
miss
mountjoy
a
cousin
of
ours
mountjoy
miss
mountjoy
suggested
jones
yes
mountjoy
miss
mountjoy
that
of
course
is
over
mountjoy
has
brought
himself
to
such
a
pass
that
he
is
not
entitled
to
have
a
miss
mountjoy
any
longer
it
seems
the
proper
thing
that
she
shall
pass
with
the
rest
of
the
family
property
to
the
true
heir
you
marry
her
we
need
not
talk
about
that
just
at
present
i
do
know
that
made
up
my
mind
at
any
rate
i
do
not
intend
that
harry
annesley
shall
have
her
i
should
think
not
he
a
pestilential
cur
that
has
got
himself
introduced
into
the
family
and
the
sooner
we
get
quit
of
him
the
better
i
should
think
the
young
lady
would
hardly
fancy
him
when
she
knows
that
he
has
lied
like
the
very
devil
with
the
object
of
getting
her
former
lover
out
of
the
way
by
jove
no
i
should
think
not
and
when
the
world
comes
to
understand
that
harry
annesley
in
the
midst
of
all
these
inquiries
knows
all
about
poor
mountjoy
was
the
last
to
see
him
in
london
and
has
never
come
forward
to
say
a
word
about
him
then
i
think
the
world
will
be
a
little
hard
upon
the
immaculate
harry
annesley
his
own
uncle
has
quarrelled
with
him
already
what
uncle
the
gentleman
down
in
hertfordshire
on
the
strength
of
whose
acres
master
harry
is
flaunting
it
about
in
idleness
i
have
my
eyes
open
and
can
see
as
well
as
another
when
harry
lectures
me
about
my
father
and
my
father
about
me
one
would
suppose
that
there
not
a
hole
in
his
own
coat
i
think
he
find
that
the
garment
is
not
altogether
then
augustus
finding
that
he
had
told
as
much
as
was
needful
to
septimus
jones
left
his
friend
and
went
about
his
own
family
business
on
the
next
morning
septimus
jones
took
his
departure
and
on
the
day
following
augustus
followed
him
so
you
off
his
father
said
to
him
when
he
came
to
make
his
adieux
well
yes
i
suppose
so
a
man
has
got
so
many
things
to
look
after
which
he
ca
attend
to
down
here
i
do
know
what
they
are
but
you
understand
it
all
i
not
going
to
ask
you
to
stay
does
it
ever
occur
to
you
that
you
may
never
see
me
again
what
a
question
it
one
that
requires
an
answer
at
any
rate
it
does
occur
to
me
but
not
at
all
as
probable
why
not
probable
because
there
a
telegraph
wire
from
tretton
to
london
and
because
the
journey
down
here
is
very
short
it
also
occurs
to
me
to
think
so
from
what
has
been
said
by
sir
william
brodrick
of
course
any
man
may
die
suddenly
especially
when
the
surgeons
have
been
at
him
you
have
your
sister
with
you
sir
and
she
will
be
of
more
comfort
to
you
than
i
can
be
your
condition
is
in
some
respects
an
advantage
to
you
these
creditors
of
mountjoy
ca
force
their
way
in
upon
you
you
are
wrong
there
they
have
not
done
so
nor
should
they
though
i
were
as
strong
as
you
what
are
creditors
to
me
they
have
not
a
scrap
of
my
handwriting
in
their
possession
there
is
not
one
who
can
say
that
he
has
even
a
verbal
promise
from
me
they
never
came
to
me
when
they
wanted
to
lend
him
money
at
fifty
per
cent
did
they
ever
hear
me
say
that
he
was
my
heir
perhaps
not
not
one
has
ever
heard
it
it
was
not
to
them
i
lied
but
to
you
and
to
grey
d
the
creditors
what
do
i
care
for
them
though
they
be
all
ruined
not
in
the
least
why
do
you
talk
to
me
about
the
creditors
you
at
any
rate
know
the
truth
then
augustus
quitted
the
room
leaving
his
father
in
a
passion
but
as
a
fact
he
was
by
no
means
assured
as
to
the
truth
he
supposed
that
he
was
the
heir
but
might
it
not
be
possible
that
his
father
had
contrived
all
this
so
as
to
save
the
property
from
mountjoy
and
that
greedy
pack
of
grey
must
surely
know
the
truth
but
why
should
not
grey
be
deceived
on
the
second
event
as
well
as
the
first
there
was
no
limit
augustus
sometimes
thought
to
his
cleverness
this
idea
had
occurred
to
him
within
the
last
week
and
his
mind
was
tormented
with
reflecting
what
might
yet
be
his
condition
but
of
one
thing
he
was
sure
that
his
father
and
mountjoy
were
not
in
league
together
mountjoy
at
any
rate
believed
himself
to
have
been
disinherited
mountjoy
conceived
that
his
only
chance
of
obtaining
money
arose
from
his
brother
the
circumstances
of
mountjoy
absence
were
at
any
rate
unknown
to
his
father
chapter
x
sir
magnus
mountjoy
it
was
the
peculiarity
of
florence
mountjoy
that
she
did
not
expect
other
people
to
be
as
good
as
herself
it
was
not
that
she
erected
for
herself
a
high
standard
and
had
then
told
herself
that
she
had
no
right
to
demand
from
others
one
so
exalted
she
had
erected
nothing
nor
did
she
know
that
she
attempted
to
live
by
grand
rules
she
had
no
idea
that
she
was
better
than
anybody
else
but
it
came
to
her
naturally
as
the
result
of
what
had
gone
before
to
be
unselfish
generous
trusting
and
pure
these
may
be
regarded
as
feminine
virtues
and
may
be
said
to
be
sometimes
tarnished
by
faults
which
are
equally
feminine
unselfishness
may
become
want
of
character
generosity
essentially
unjust
confidence
may
be
weak
and
purity
insipid
here
it
was
that
the
strength
of
florence
mountjoy
asserted
itself
she
knew
well
what
was
due
to
herself
though
she
would
not
claim
it
she
could
trust
to
another
but
in
silence
be
quite
sure
of
herself
though
pure
herself
she
was
rarely
shocked
by
the
ways
of
others
and
she
was
as
true
as
a
man
pretends
to
be
in
figure
form
and
face
she
never
demanded
immediate
homage
by
the
sudden
flash
of
her
beauty
but
when
her
spell
had
once
fallen
on
a
man
spirit
it
was
not
often
that
he
could
escape
from
it
quickly
when
she
spoke
a
peculiar
melody
struck
the
hearer
ears
her
voice
was
soft
and
low
and
sweet
and
full
at
all
times
of
harmonious
words
but
when
she
laughed
it
was
like
soft
winds
playing
among
countless
silver
bells
there
was
something
in
her
touch
which
to
men
was
almost
divine
of
this
she
was
all
unconscious
but
was
as
chary
with
her
fingers
as
though
it
seemed
that
she
could
ill
spare
her
divinity
in
height
she
was
a
little
above
the
common
but
it
was
by
the
grace
of
her
movements
that
the
world
was
compelled
to
observe
her
figure
there
are
women
whose
grace
is
so
remarkable
as
to
demand
the
attention
of
all
but
then
it
is
known
of
them
and
momentarily
seen
that
their
grace
is
peculiar
they
have
studied
their
graces
and
the
result
is
there
only
too
evident
but
florence
seemed
to
have
studied
nothing
the
beholder
felt
that
she
must
have
been
as
graceful
when
playing
with
her
doll
in
the
nursery
and
it
was
the
same
with
her
beauty
there
was
no
peculiarity
of
chiselled
features
had
you
taken
her
face
and
measured
it
by
certain
rules
you
would
have
found
that
her
mouth
was
too
large
and
her
nose
irregular
of
her
teeth
she
showed
but
little
and
in
her
complexion
there
was
none
of
that
pellucid
clearness
in
which
men
ordinarily
delight
but
her
eyes
were
more
than
ordinarily
bright
and
when
she
laughed
there
seemed
to
stream
from
them
some
heavenly
delight
when
she
did
laugh
it
was
as
though
some
spring
had
been
opened
from
which
ran
for
the
time
a
stream
of
sweetest
intimacy
for
the
time
you
would
then
fancy
that
you
had
been
let
into
the
inner
life
of
this
girl
and
would
be
proud
of
yourself
that
so
much
should
have
been
granted
you
you
would
feel
that
there
was
something
also
in
yourself
in
that
this
should
have
been
permitted
her
hair
and
eyebrows
were
dark
brown
of
the
hue
most
common
to
men
and
women
and
had
in
them
nothing
that
was
peculiar
but
her
hair
was
soft
and
smooth
and
ever
well
dressed
and
never
redolent
of
peculiar
odors
it
was
simply
florence
hair
and
that
made
it
perfect
in
the
eyes
of
her
male
friends
generally
she
not
such
a
wonderful
beauty
after
all
once
said
of
her
a
gentleman
to
whom
it
may
be
presumed
that
she
had
not
taken
the
trouble
to
be
peculiarly
attractive
no
said
another
no
but
by
george
i
should
like
to
have
the
altering
of
her
it
was
thus
that
men
generally
felt
in
regard
to
florence
mountjoy
when
they
came
to
reckon
her
up
they
did
not
see
how
any
change
was
to
be
made
for
the
better
to
florence
as
to
most
other
girls
the
question
of
her
future
life
had
been
a
great
trouble
whom
should
she
marry
and
whom
should
she
decline
to
marry
to
a
girl
when
it
is
proposed
to
her
suddenly
to
change
everything
in
life
to
go
altogether
away
and
place
herself
under
the
custody
of
a
new
master
to
find
for
herself
a
new
home
new
pursuits
new
aspirations
and
a
strange
companion
the
change
must
be
so
complete
as
almost
to
frighten
her
by
its
awfulness
and
yet
it
has
to
be
always
thought
of
and
generally
done
but
this
change
had
been
presented
to
florence
in
a
manner
more
than
ordinarily
burdensome
early
in
life
when
naturally
she
would
not
have
begun
to
think
seriously
of
marriage
she
had
been
told
rather
than
asked
to
give
herself
to
her
cousin
mountjoy
she
was
too
firm
of
character
to
accede
at
once
to
deliver
herself
over
body
and
soul
to
the
tender
mercies
of
one
in
truth
unknown
but
she
had
been
unable
to
interpose
any
reason
that
was
valid
and
had
contented
herself
by
demanding
time
since
that
there
had
been
moments
in
which
she
had
almost
yielded
mountjoy
scarborough
had
been
so
represented
to
her
that
she
had
considered
it
to
be
almost
a
duty
to
yield
more
than
once
the
word
had
been
all
but
spoken
but
the
word
had
never
been
spoken
she
had
been
subjected
to
what
might
be
called
cruel
pressure
in
season
and
out
of
season
her
mother
had
represented
as
a
duty
this
marriage
with
her
cousin
why
should
she
not
marry
her
cousin
it
must
be
understood
that
these
questions
had
been
asked
before
any
of
the
terrible
facts
of
captain
scarborough
life
had
been
made
known
to
her
because
it
may
be
said
she
did
not
love
him
but
in
these
days
she
had
loved
no
man
and
was
inclined
to
think
so
little
of
herself
as
to
make
her
want
of
love
no
necessary
bar
to
the
accomplishment
of
the
wish
of
others
by
degrees
she
was
spoken
of
among
their
acquaintance
as
the
promised
bride
of
mountjoy
scarborough
and
though
she
ever
denied
the
imputation
there
came
over
her
girl
heart
a
feeling
very
sad
and
very
solemn
but
still
all
but
accepted
that
so
it
must
be
then
harry
annesley
had
crossed
her
path
and
the
question
had
been
at
last
nearly
answered
and
the
doubts
nearly
decided
she
did
not
quite
know
at
first
that
she
loved
harry
annesley
but
was
almost
sure
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
become
the
wife
of
mountjoy
scarborough
then
there
came
nearly
twelve
months
of
most
painful
uncertainty
in
her
life
it
is
very
hard
for
a
young
girl
to
have
to
be
firm
with
her
mother
in
declining
a
proposed
marriage
when
all
circumstances
of
the
connection
are
recommended
to
her
as
being
peculiarly
alluring
and
there
was
nothing
in
the
personal
manners
of
her
cousin
which
seemed
to
justify
her
in
declaring
her
abhorrence
he
was
a
dark
handsome
man
whose
chief
sin
it
was
in
the
eyes
of
his
cousin
that
he
seemed
to
demand
from
her
affection
worship
and
obedience
she
did
not
analyse
his
character
but
she
felt
it
and
when
it
came
to
pass
that
tidings
of
his
debts
at
last
reached
her
she
felt
that
she
was
glad
of
an
excuse
though
she
knew
that
the
excuse
would
not
have
prevailed
with
her
had
she
liked
him
then
came
his
debts
and
with
the
knowledge
of
them
a
keener
perception
of
his
imperiousness
she
could
consent
to
become
the
wife
of
the
man
who
had
squandered
his
property
and
wasted
his
estate
but
not
of
one
who
before
his
marriage
demanded
of
her
that
submission
which
as
she
thought
should
be
given
by
her
freely
after
her
marriage
harry
annesley
glided
into
her
heart
after
a
manner
very
different
from
this
she
knew
that
he
adored
her
but
yet
he
did
not
hasten
to
tell
her
so
she
knew
that
she
loved
him
but
she
doubted
whether
a
time
would
ever
come
in
which
she
could
confess
it
it
was
not
till
he
had
come
to
acknowledge
the
trouble
to
which
mountjoy
had
subjected
him
that
he
had
ever
ventured
to
speak
plainly
of
his
own
passion
and
even
then
he
had
not
asked
for
a
reply
she
was
still
free
as
she
thought
of
all
this
but
she
did
at
last
tell
herself
that
let
her
mother
say
what
she
would
she
certainly
never
would
stand
at
the
altar
with
her
cousin
mountjoy
even
now
when
the
captain
had
been
declared
not
to
be
his
heir
and
when
all
the
world
knew
that
he
had
disappeared
from
the
face
of
the
earth
mountjoy
did
not
altogether
give
him
up
she
partly
disbelieved
her
brother
and
partly
thought
that
circumstances
could
not
be
so
bad
as
they
were
described
to
her
feminine
mind
to
her
living
not
in
the
world
of
london
but
in
the
very
moderate
fashion
of
cheltenham
it
seemed
to
be
impossible
that
an
entail
should
be
thus
blighted
in
the
bud
why
was
an
entail
called
an
entail
unless
it
were
ineradicable
a
decision
of
fate
rather
than
of
man
and
of
law
and
to
her
eyes
mountjoy
scarborough
was
so
commanding
that
all
things
must
at
last
be
compelled
to
go
as
he
would
have
them
and
to
tell
the
truth
there
had
lately
come
to
mountjoy
a
word
of
comfort
which
might
be
necessary
if
the
world
should
be
absolutely
upset
in
accordance
with
the
wicked
skill
of
her
brother
which
even
in
that
case
might
make
crooked
things
smooth
augustus
whom
she
had
regarded
always
as
quite
a
mountjoy
because
of
his
talent
and
appearance
and
habit
of
command
had
whispered
to
her
a
word
why
should
not
florence
be
transferred
with
the
remainder
of
the
property
there
was
something
to
mountjoy
feelings
base
in
the
idea
at
the
first
blush
of
it
she
did
not
like
to
be
untrue
to
her
gallant
nephew
but
as
she
came
to
turn
it
in
her
mind
there
were
certain
circumstances
which
recommended
the
change
to
her
should
the
change
be
necessary
florence
certainly
had
expressed
an
unintelligible
objection
to
the
elder
brother
why
should
the
younger
not
be
more
successful
mountjoy
heart
had
begun
to
droop
within
her
as
she
had
thought
that
her
girl
would
prove
deaf
to
the
voice
of
the
charmer
another
charmer
had
come
most
objectionable
in
her
sight
but
to
him
no
word
of
absolute
encouragement
had
as
she
thought
been
yet
spoken
augustus
had
already
obtained
for
himself
among
his
friends
the
character
of
an
eloquent
young
lawyer
let
him
come
and
try
his
eloquence
on
his
cousin
only
let
it
first
be
ascertained
as
an
assured
fact
and
beyond
the
possibility
of
all
retrogression
that
the
squire
villainy
was
certain
i
think
my
love
she
said
to
her
daughter
one
day
that
under
the
immediate
circumstances
of
the
family
we
should
retire
for
a
while
into
private
life
this
occurred
on
the
very
day
on
which
septimus
jones
had
been
vaguely
informed
of
the
iniquitous
falsehood
of
harry
annesley
good
gracious
mamma
is
not
our
life
always
private
she
had
understood
it
all
that
the
private
life
was
intended
altogether
to
exclude
harry
but
was
to
be
made
open
to
the
manoeuvres
of
her
cousin
such
as
they
might
be
not
in
the
sense
in
which
i
mean
your
poor
uncle
is
dying
we
hear
that
sir
william
says
he
is
better
i
fear
nevertheless
that
he
is
dying
though
it
may
perhaps
take
a
long
time
and
then
poor
mountjoy
has
disappeared
i
think
that
we
should
see
no
one
till
the
mystery
about
mountjoy
has
been
cleared
up
and
then
the
story
is
so
very
discreditable
i
do
not
see
that
that
is
an
affair
of
ours
said
florence
who
had
no
desire
to
be
shut
up
just
at
the
present
moment
we
can
not
help
ourselves
this
making
his
eldest
son
out
to
be
oh
something
so
very
different
is
too
horrible
to
be
thought
of
i
am
told
that
nobody
knows
the
truth
we
at
any
rate
are
not
implicated
in
that
but
we
are
he
at
any
rate
is
my
brother
and
mountjoy
is
my
nephew
or
at
any
rate
was
poor
augustus
is
thrown
into
terrible
difficulties
i
am
told
that
he
is
greatly
pleased
at
finding
that
tretton
is
to
belong
to
him
who
tells
you
that
you
have
no
right
to
believe
anything
about
such
near
relatives
from
any
one
whoever
told
you
so
has
been
very
wicked
mountjoy
no
doubt
thought
that
this
wicked
communication
had
been
made
by
harry
annesley
augustus
has
always
proved
himself
to
be
affectionate
and
respectful
to
his
elder
brother
that
is
to
his
brother
who
is
is
older
than
himself
added
mountjoy
feeling
that
there
was
a
difficulty
in
expressing
herself
as
to
the
presumed
condition
of
the
two
scarboroughs
of
course
he
would
rather
be
owner
of
tretton
than
let
any
one
else
have
it
if
you
mean
that
the
honor
of
the
family
is
very
much
to
him
i
do
not
know
that
the
family
can
have
any
honor
left
said
florence
severely
my
dear
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
the
scarboroughs
have
always
held
their
heads
very
high
in
staffordshire
and
more
so
of
late
than
ever
i
do
mean
quite
of
late
but
since
tretton
became
of
so
much
importance
now
i
tell
you
what
i
think
we
had
better
do
we
go
and
spend
six
weeks
with
your
uncle
at
brussels
he
has
always
been
pressing
us
to
come
oh
mamma
he
does
not
want
us
how
can
you
say
that
how
do
you
know
i
am
sure
sir
magnus
will
not
care
for
our
coming
now
besides
how
could
that
be
retiring
into
private
life
sir
magnus
as
ambassador
has
his
house
always
full
of
company
my
dear
he
is
not
ambassador
he
is
minister
plenipotentiary
it
is
not
quite
the
same
thing
and
then
he
is
our
nearest
relative
our
nearest
at
least
since
my
own
brother
has
made
this
great
separation
of
course
we
can
not
go
to
him
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
himself
why
do
you
want
to
go
anywhere
mamma
why
not
stay
at
home
but
florence
pleaded
in
vain
as
her
mother
had
already
made
up
her
mind
before
that
day
was
over
she
succeeded
in
making
her
daughter
understand
that
she
was
to
be
taken
to
brussels
as
soon
as
an
answer
could
be
received
from
sir
magnus
and
the
necessary
additions
were
made
to
their
joint
wardrobe
sir
magnus
mountjoy
the
late
general
elder
brother
had
been
for
the
last
four
or
five
years
the
english
minister
at
brussels
he
had
been
minister
somewhere
for
a
very
long
time
so
that
the
memory
of
man
hardly
ran
back
beyond
it
and
was
said
to
have
gained
for
himself
very
extensive
popularity
it
had
always
been
a
point
with
successive
governments
to
see
that
poor
sir
magnus
got
something
and
sir
magnus
had
never
been
left
altogether
in
the
cold
he
was
not
a
man
who
would
have
been
left
out
in
the
cold
in
silence
and
perhaps
the
feeling
that
such
was
the
case
had
been
as
efficacious
on
his
behalf
as
his
popularity
at
any
rate
poor
sir
magnus
had
always
been
well
placed
and
was
now
working
out
his
last
year
or
two
before
the
blessed
achievement
of
his
pursuit
should
have
been
reached
sir
magnus
had
a
wife
of
whom
it
was
said
at
home
that
she
was
almost
as
popular
as
her
husband
but
the
opinion
of
the
world
at
brussels
on
this
subject
was
a
good
deal
divided
there
were
those
who
declared
that
lady
mountjoy
was
of
all
women
the
most
overbearing
and
impertinent
but
they
were
generally
english
residents
at
brussels
who
had
come
to
live
there
as
a
place
at
which
education
for
their
children
would
be
cheaper
than
at
home
of
these
lady
mountjoy
had
been
heard
to
declare
that
she
saw
no
reason
why
because
she
was
the
minister
wife
she
should
be
expected
to
entertain
all
the
world
of
london
this
of
course
must
be
understood
with
a
good
deal
of
allowance
as
the
english
world
at
brussels
was
much
too
large
to
expect
to
be
so
received
but
there
were
certain
ladies
living
on
the
confines
of
high
society
who
thought
that
they
had
a
right
to
be
admitted
and
who
grievously
resented
their
exclusion
it
can
not
therefore
be
said
that
lady
mountjoy
was
popular
but
she
was
large
in
figure
and
painted
well
and
wore
her
diamonds
with
an
air
which
her
peculiar
favorites
declared
to
be
majestic
you
could
not
see
her
going
along
the
boulevards
in
her
carriage
without
being
aware
that
a
special
personage
was
passing
upon
the
whole
it
may
be
said
that
she
performed
well
her
special
role
in
life
of
sir
magnus
it
was
hinted
that
he
was
afraid
of
his
wife
but
in
truth
he
desired
it
to
be
understood
that
all
the
disagreeable
things
done
at
the
embassy
were
done
by
lady
mountjoy
and
not
by
him
he
did
not
refuse
leave
to
the
ladies
to
drop
their
cards
at
his
he
could
ask
a
few
men
to
his
table
without
referring
the
matter
to
his
wife
but
every
one
would
understand
that
the
asking
of
ladies
was
based
on
a
different
footing
he
knew
well
that
as
a
rule
it
was
not
fitting
that
he
should
ask
a
married
man
without
his
wife
but
there
are
occasions
on
which
an
excuse
can
be
given
and
upon
the
whole
the
men
liked
it
he
was
a
stout
tall
portly
old
gentleman
sixty
years
of
age
but
looking
somewhat
older
whom
it
was
a
difficulty
to
place
on
horseback
but
who
when
there
looked
remarkably
well
he
rarely
rose
to
a
trot
during
his
two
hours
of
exercise
which
to
the
two
attaché
who
were
told
off
for
the
duty
of
accompanying
him
was
the
hardest
part
of
their
allotted
work
but
other
gentlemen
would
lay
themselves
out
to
meet
sir
magnus
and
to
ride
with
him
and
in
this
way
he
achieved
that
character
for
popularity
which
had
been
a
better
aid
to
him
in
life
than
all
the
diplomatic
skill
which
he
possessed
what
do
you
think
said
he
walking
off
with
mountjoy
letter
into
his
wife
room
i
do
think
anything
my
dear
you
never
do
lady
mountjoy
who
had
not
yet
undergone
her
painting
looked
cross
and
at
any
rate
sarah
and
her
daughter
are
proposing
to
come
here
good
gracious
at
once
yes
at
once
of
course
i
asked
them
over
and
over
again
and
something
was
said
about
this
autumn
when
we
had
come
back
from
pimperingen
why
did
you
not
tell
me
bother
i
did
tell
you
this
kind
of
thing
always
turns
up
at
last
she
a
very
good
kind
of
a
woman
and
the
daughter
is
all
that
she
ought
to
be
of
course
she
be
flirting
with
anderson
anderson
was
one
of
the
two
mounted
attachés
anderson
will
know
how
to
look
after
himself
said
sir
magnus
at
any
rate
they
must
come
they
have
never
troubled
us
before
and
we
ought
to
put
up
with
them
once
but
my
dear
what
is
all
this
about
her
brother
she
wo
bring
her
brother
with
her
how
can
you
be
sure
of
that
said
the
anxious
lady
he
is
dying
and
ca
be
moved
but
that
son
of
his
mountjoy
it
altogether
a
most
distressing
story
he
turns
out
to
be
nobody
after
all
and
now
he
has
disappeared
and
the
papers
for
an
entire
month
were
full
of
him
what
would
you
do
if
he
were
to
turn
up
here
the
girl
was
engaged
to
him
you
know
and
has
only
thrown
him
off
since
his
own
father
declared
that
he
was
not
legitimate
there
never
was
such
a
mess
about
anything
since
london
first
began
then
sir
magnus
declared
that
let
mountjoy
scarborough
and
his
father
have
misbehaved
as
they
might
scarborough
sister
must
be
received
at
brussels
there
was
a
little
family
difficulty
sir
magnus
had
borrowed
three
thousand
pounds
from
the
general
which
had
been
settled
on
the
general
widow
and
the
interest
was
not
always
paid
with
extreme
punctuality
to
give
mountjoy
her
due
it
must
be
said
that
this
had
not
entered
into
her
consideration
when
she
had
written
to
her
but
it
was
a
burden
to
sir
magnus
and
had
always
tended
to
produce
from
him
a
reiteration
of
those
invitations
which
mountjoy
had
taken
as
an
expression
of
brotherly
love
her
own
income
was
always
sufficient
for
her
wants
and
the
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
coming
from
sir
magnus
had
not
troubled
her
much
well
my
dear
if
it
must
be
it
must
only
what
i
to
do
with
her
i
do
not
know
take
her
about
in
the
carriage
said
sir
magnus
who
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
angry
with
this
interference
and
the
daughter
daughters
are
twice
more
troublesome
than
their
mothers
pass
her
over
to
miss
abbott
and
for
goodness
sake
do
make
so
much
trouble
about
things
which
need
not
be
troublesome
then
sir
magnus
left
his
wife
to
ring
for
her
chambermaid
and
go
on
with
her
painting
while
he
himself
undertook
the
unwonted
task
of
writing
an
affectionate
letter
to
his
it
should
be
here
explained
that
sir
magnus
had
no
children
of
his
own
and
that
miss
abbott
was
the
lady
who
was
bound
to
smile
and
say
pretty
things
on
all
occasions
to
lady
mountjoy
for
the
moderate
remuneration
of
two
hundred
a
year
and
her
maintenance
the
letter
which
sir
magnus
wrote
was
as
follows
my
dear
sarah
lady
mountjoy
bids
me
say
that
we
shall
be
delighted
to
receive
you
and
my
niece
at
the
british
ministry
on
the
of
october
and
hope
that
you
will
stay
with
us
till
the
end
of
the
believe
me
most
affectionately
yours
magnus
mountjoy
i
have
a
most
kind
letter
from
sir
magnus
said
mountjoy
to
her
daughter
what
does
he
say
that
he
will
be
delighted
to
receive
us
on
the
of
october
i
did
say
that
we
should
be
ready
to
start
in
about
a
week
time
because
i
know
that
he
gets
home
from
his
autumn
holiday
by
the
middle
of
september
but
i
have
no
doubt
he
has
his
house
full
till
the
time
he
has
named
do
you
know
her
mamma
asked
florence
i
did
see
her
once
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
know
her
she
used
to
be
a
very
handsome
woman
and
looks
to
be
quite
but
sir
magnus
has
always
lived
abroad
and
except
when
he
came
home
about
your
poor
father
death
i
have
seen
very
little
of
him
i
never
saw
him
but
that
once
said
florence
and
so
it
was
settled
that
she
and
her
mother
were
to
spend
a
month
at
brussels
chapter
xi
monte
carlo
toward
the
end
of
september
while
the
weather
was
so
hot
as
to
keep
away
from
the
south
of
france
all
but
very
determined
travellers
an
english
gentleman
not
very
beautiful
in
his
outward
appearance
was
sauntering
about
the
great
hall
of
the
at
monte
carlo
in
the
kingdom
or
principality
of
monaco
the
only
now
left
in
europe
in
which
idle
men
of
a
speculative
nature
may
yet
solace
their
hours
with
some
excitement
nor
is
the
amusement
denied
to
idle
ladies
as
might
be
seen
by
two
or
three
who
at
this
moment
were
depositing
their
shawls
and
parasols
with
the
porters
the
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
eleven
when
the
would
be
open
and
the
amusement
was
too
rich
in
its
nature
to
allow
of
the
loss
of
even
a
few
minutes
but
this
gentleman
was
not
an
nor
was
he
known
even
by
name
to
any
of
the
small
crowd
that
was
then
assembled
but
it
was
known
to
many
of
them
that
he
had
had
a
great
turn
of
luck
on
the
preceding
day
and
had
walked
off
from
the
table
with
four
or
five
hundred
pounds
the
weather
was
still
so
hot
that
but
few
englishmen
were
there
and
the
play
had
not
as
yet
begun
to
run
high
there
were
only
two
or
three
men
who
can
not
keep
their
hands
from
ruin
when
ruin
is
open
to
them
to
them
heat
and
cold
the
or
twenty
degrees
below
zero
make
no
difference
while
the
croupier
is
there
with
his
rouleaux
before
him
capable
of
turning
up
the
card
they
know
that
the
chance
is
against
them
one
in
twenty
let
us
say
and
that
in
the
one
in
twenty
is
as
good
as
two
to
one
to
effect
their
ruin
for
a
day
they
may
stand
against
one
in
twenty
as
this
man
had
done
for
two
or
three
days
for
a
week
they
may
possibly
do
so
but
they
know
that
the
doom
must
come
at
last
as
it
does
come
invariably
and
they
go
on
but
our
friend
the
englishman
who
had
won
the
money
was
not
such
a
one
as
these
at
any
rate
in
regard
to
monaco
yesterday
had
been
his
first
appearance
and
he
had
broken
ground
there
with
great
success
he
was
an
person
poorly
clad
what
in
common
parlance
we
should
call
seedy
he
had
not
a
scrap
of
beard
on
his
face
and
though
swarthy
and
dark
as
to
his
countenance
was
light
as
to
his
hair
which
hung
in
quantities
down
his
back
he
was
dressed
from
head
to
foot
in
a
suit
of
tweed
of
which
he
wore
the
coat
buttoned
tight
over
his
chest
as
though
to
hide
some
deficiency
of
linen
the
gentleman
was
altogether
a
personage
and
they
who
had
seen
him
win
his
money
frenchmen
and
italians
for
the
most
part
had
declared
among
themselves
that
his
luck
had
been
most
miraculous
it
was
observed
that
he
had
a
companion
with
him
who
stuck
close
to
his
elbow
and
it
was
asserted
that
this
companion
continually
urged
him
to
leave
the
room
but
as
long
as
the
croupier
remained
at
the
table
he
remained
and
continued
to
play
through
the
day
with
almost
invariable
luck
it
was
surmised
among
the
gamblers
there
that
he
had
not
entered
the
room
with
above
twenty
or
thirty
pieces
in
his
pocket
and
that
he
had
taken
away
with
him
when
the
place
was
closed
six
hundred
napoleons
look
there
he
has
come
again
to
give
it
all
back
to
madame
blanc
with
interest
said
a
frenchman
to
an
italian
yes
and
he
will
end
by
blowing
his
brains
out
within
a
week
he
is
just
the
man
to
do
it
these
englishmen
always
rush
at
their
fate
like
mad
bulls
said
the
frenchman
they
get
less
distraction
for
their
money
than
any
one
che
va
piano
va
sano
said
the
italian
jingling
the
four
napoleons
in
his
pocket
which
had
been
six
on
yesterday
morning
then
they
sauntered
up
to
the
englishman
and
both
of
them
touched
their
hats
to
him
the
englishman
just
acknowledged
the
compliment
and
walked
off
with
his
companion
who
was
still
whispering
something
into
his
ear
it
is
a
gendarme
who
is
with
him
i
think
said
the
frenchman
only
the
man
does
not
walk
erect
who
does
not
know
the
outside
hall
of
the
magnificent
at
monte
carlo
with
all
the
golden
splendor
of
its
within
who
does
not
know
the
lofty
roof
and
lounging
seats
with
its
luxuries
of
liveried
servants
its
wealth
of
newspapers
and
every
appanage
of
costly
comfort
which
can
be
added
to
it
and
its
music
within
who
does
not
know
that
there
are
to
be
heard
sounds
in
a
greater
perfection
of
orchestral
melody
than
are
to
be
procured
by
money
and
trouble
combined
in
the
great
capitals
of
europe
think
of
the
trouble
endured
by
those
unhappy
fathers
of
families
who
indulge
their
wives
and
daughters
at
the
philharmonic
and
james
hall
think
of
the
horrors
of
our
theatres
with
their
hot
gas
and
narrow
passages
and
difficulties
of
entrance
and
almost
impossibility
of
escape
and
for
all
this
money
has
to
be
paid
high
prices
and
the
day
has
to
be
fixed
long
beforehand
so
that
the
tickets
may
be
secured
and
the
daily
feast
papa
too
often
solitary
enjoyment
has
to
be
turned
into
a
painful
early
fast
and
when
at
last
the
thing
has
been
done
and
the
torment
endured
the
sounds
heard
have
not
always
been
good
of
their
kind
for
the
money
has
not
sufficed
to
purchase
the
aid
of
a
crowd
of
the
best
musicians
but
at
monte
carlo
you
walk
in
with
your
wife
in
her
morning
costume
and
seating
yourself
luxuriously
in
one
of
those
soft
stalls
which
are
there
prepared
for
you
you
give
yourself
up
with
perfect
ease
to
absolute
enjoyment
for
two
hours
the
concert
lasts
and
all
around
is
perfection
and
gilding
there
is
nothing
to
annoy
the
most
fastidious
taste
you
have
not
heated
yourself
with
fighting
your
way
up
crowded
stairs
no
has
asked
you
for
a
shilling
no
has
dunned
you
because
he
stood
useless
for
a
moment
at
the
door
of
your
carriage
no
panic
has
seized
you
and
still
oppresses
you
because
of
the
narrow
dimensions
in
which
you
have
to
seat
yourself
for
the
next
three
hours
there
are
no
twenty
minutes
during
which
you
are
doomed
to
sit
in
miserable
expectation
exactly
at
the
hour
named
the
music
begins
and
for
two
hours
it
is
your
own
fault
if
you
be
not
happy
a
has
brought
you
to
steps
leading
up
to
the
garden
in
which
these
princely
halls
are
built
and
when
the
music
is
over
will
again
take
you
home
nothing
can
be
more
perfect
than
the
at
monte
carlo
and
nothing
more
charming
and
for
all
this
there
is
nothing
whatever
to
pay
but
by
whom
out
of
whose
pocket
are
all
these
good
things
provided
they
tell
you
at
monte
carlo
that
from
time
to
time
are
to
be
seen
men
walking
off
in
the
dark
of
the
night
or
the
gloom
of
the
evening
or
for
the
matter
of
that
in
the
broad
light
of
day
if
the
stern
necessity
of
the
hour
require
it
with
a
burden
among
them
to
be
deposited
where
it
may
not
be
seen
or
heard
of
any
more
they
are
carrying
away
all
that
mortal
remains
of
one
of
the
gentlemen
who
have
paid
for
your
musical
entertainment
he
has
given
his
all
for
the
purpose
and
has
then
blown
his
brains
out
it
is
one
of
the
disagreeable
incidents
to
which
the
otherwise
extremely
pleasant
operations
of
the
establishment
are
liable
such
accidents
will
happen
a
the
keeper
of
which
is
able
to
maintain
the
royal
expense
of
the
neighboring
court
out
of
his
winnings
and
also
to
keep
open
for
those
who
are
not
ashamed
to
accept
it
gratis
all
for
love
a
brilliant
with
gold
filled
with
the
best
performers
whom
the
world
can
furnish
and
comfortable
beyond
all
known
to
men
must
be
liable
to
a
few
such
misfortunes
who
is
not
ashamed
to
accept
i
have
said
having
lately
been
there
and
thoroughly
enjoyed
myself
but
i
did
not
put
myself
in
the
way
of
having
to
cut
my
throat
on
which
account
i
felt
as
i
came
out
that
i
had
been
somewhat
shabby
i
was
ashamed
in
that
i
had
not
put
a
few
napoleons
down
on
the
table
conscience
had
prevented
me
and
a
wish
to
keep
my
money
but
should
not
conscience
have
kept
me
away
from
all
that
happiness
for
which
i
had
not
paid
i
had
not
thought
of
it
before
i
went
to
monte
carlo
but
i
am
inclined
now
to
advise
others
to
stay
away
or
else
to
put
down
half
a
napoleon
at
any
rate
as
the
price
of
a
ticket
the
place
is
not
overcrowded
because
the
conscience
of
many
is
keener
than
was
mine
we
ought
to
be
grateful
to
the
august
sovereign
of
monaco
in
that
he
enabled
an
enterprising
individual
to
keep
open
for
us
in
so
brilliant
a
fashion
the
last
public
in
europe
the
principality
is
but
large
enough
to
contain
the
court
of
the
sovereign
which
is
held
in
the
little
town
of
monaco
and
the
establishment
of
the
last
of
legitimate
gamblers
which
is
maintained
at
monte
carlo
if
the
report
of
the
world
does
not
malign
the
prince
he
lives
as
does
the
gambler
out
of
the
spoil
taken
from
the
gamblers
he
is
to
be
seen
in
his
royal
carriage
going
forth
with
his
royal
consort
and
very
royal
he
looks
his
little
teacup
of
a
kingdom
or
rather
a
roll
of
french
bread
for
it
is
crusty
and
picturesque
is
now
surrounded
by
france
there
is
nice
away
to
the
west
and
mentone
to
the
east
and
the
whole
kingdom
lies
within
the
compass
of
a
walk
mentone
in
france
at
any
rate
is
within
five
miles
of
the
monarch
residence
how
happy
it
is
that
there
should
be
so
blessed
a
spot
left
in
tranquillity
on
the
earth
surface
but
on
the
present
occasion
monte
carlo
was
not
in
all
its
grandeur
because
of
the
heat
of
the
weather
another
month
and
english
lords
and
english
members
of
parliament
and
english
barristers
would
be
there
all
men
for
instance
who
could
afford
to
be
indifferent
as
to
their
character
for
a
month
and
the
place
would
be
quite
alive
with
music
cards
and
dice
at
present
men
of
business
only
flocked
to
its
halls
eagerly
intent
on
making
money
though
alas
almost
all
doomed
to
lose
it
but
our
one
friend
with
the
long
light
locks
was
impatient
for
the
fray
the
had
now
been
opened
and
the
servants
of
the
table
less
impatient
than
he
were
slowly
arranging
their
money
and
their
cards
our
friend
had
taken
his
seat
and
was
already
resolving
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
table
where
he
would
make
his
first
plunge
in
his
right
hand
was
a
bag
of
gold
and
under
his
left
hand
were
hidden
the
twelve
napoleons
with
which
he
intended
to
commence
on
yesterday
he
had
gone
through
his
day
work
by
twelve
though
on
one
or
two
occasions
he
had
plunged
deeply
it
had
seemed
to
this
man
as
though
a
new
heaven
had
been
opened
to
him
as
of
late
he
had
seen
little
of
luck
in
this
world
the
surmises
made
as
to
the
low
state
of
his
funds
when
he
entered
the
room
had
been
partly
true
but
time
had
been
when
he
was
able
to
gamble
in
a
more
costly
fashion
even
than
here
and
to
play
among
those
who
had
taken
his
winnings
and
losings
simply
as
a
matter
of
course
and
now
the
game
had
begun
and
the
twelve
napoleons
were
duly
deposited
again
he
won
his
stake
an
omen
for
the
day
and
was
exultant
a
second
twelve
and
a
third
were
put
down
and
on
each
occasion
he
won
in
the
silly
imagination
of
his
heart
he
declared
to
himself
that
the
calculation
of
all
chances
was
as
nothing
against
his
run
of
luck
here
was
the
spot
on
which
it
was
destined
that
he
should
redeem
all
the
injury
which
fortune
had
done
him
and
in
truth
this
man
had
been
misused
by
fortune
his
companion
whispered
in
his
ear
but
he
heard
not
a
word
of
it
he
increased
the
twelve
to
fifteen
and
again
won
as
he
looked
round
there
was
a
halo
of
triumph
which
seemed
to
illuminate
his
face
he
had
chained
chance
to
his
and
would
persevere
now
that
the
good
time
had
come
what
did
he
care
for
the
creature
at
his
elbow
he
thought
of
all
the
good
things
which
money
could
again
purchase
for
him
as
he
carefully
fingered
the
gold
for
the
next
stake
he
had
been
rich
though
he
was
now
poor
though
how
could
a
man
be
accounted
poor
who
had
an
endless
sum
of
six
hundred
napoleons
in
his
pocket
a
sum
which
was
in
truth
endless
while
it
could
be
so
rapidly
recruited
in
this
fashion
the
next
stake
he
also
won
but
as
he
raked
all
the
pieces
which
the
croupier
pushed
toward
him
his
mind
had
become
intent
on
another
sphere
and
on
other
persons
let
him
win
what
he
might
his
old
haunts
were
now
closed
against
him
what
good
would
money
do
him
living
such
a
life
as
he
must
now
be
compelled
to
pass
as
he
thought
of
this
the
napoleons
on
the
table
were
taken
away
from
him
almost
without
consciousness
on
his
part
at
that
moment
there
came
a
voice
in
his
ear
not
the
voice
of
his
attending
friend
but
one
of
which
he
accurately
knew
the
lisping
fiendish
sound
ah
captain
scarborough
i
thought
it
vas
posshible
you
might
be
here
dis
ish
a
very
nice
place
our
friend
looked
round
and
glared
at
the
man
and
felt
that
it
was
impossible
that
this
occupation
should
be
continued
under
his
eyes
yesh
it
was
likely
how
do
you
like
monte
carlo
you
have
plenty
of
money
plenty
the
man
was
small
and
oily
and
and
with
a
perpetual
smile
on
his
face
unless
when
on
special
occasions
he
would
be
moved
to
the
expression
of
deep
anger
of
the
modern
hebrews
a
most
complete
hebrew
but
a
man
of
purpose
who
never
did
things
by
halves
who
could
count
upon
good
courage
within
and
who
never
allowed
himself
to
be
foiled
by
misadventure
he
was
one
who
beginning
with
nothing
was
determined
to
die
a
rich
man
and
was
likely
to
achieve
his
purpose
now
there
was
no
gleam
of
anger
on
his
face
but
a
look
of
invincible
which
was
not
however
quite
when
you
came
to
examine
it
closely
oh
that
is
you
is
it
mr
hart
yesh
it
is
me
i
have
followed
you
oh
i
have
had
quite
a
pleasant
tour
following
you
but
ven
i
got
my
noshe
once
on
to
the
schent
then
i
was
sure
it
was
monte
carlo
and
it
ish
monte
carlo
eh
captain
scarborough
yes
of
course
it
is
monte
carlo
that
is
to
say
monte
carlo
is
the
place
where
we
are
now
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
running
on
in
that
way
then
he
drew
back
from
the
table
hart
following
close
behind
him
and
his
attendant
at
a
farther
distance
behind
him
as
he
went
he
remembered
that
he
had
slightly
increased
the
six
hundred
napoleons
of
yesterday
and
that
the
money
was
still
in
his
own
possession
not
all
the
jews
in
london
could
touch
the
money
while
he
kept
it
in
his
pocket
who
ish
dat
man
there
asked
hart
what
can
that
be
to
you
he
seems
to
follow
you
pretty
close
not
so
close
as
you
do
by
george
and
perhaps
he
has
something
to
get
by
it
which
you
have
come
come
come
if
he
have
more
to
get
than
i
he
mush
be
pretty
deep
there
is
mishter
tyrrwhit
no
one
have
more
to
get
than
i
only
mishter
tyrrwhit
vy
captain
scarborough
the
little
game
you
wash
playing
there
which
wash
a
very
pretty
little
game
is
as
nothing
to
my
game
wish
you
when
you
see
the
money
down
on
the
table
there
it
seems
to
be
mush
because
the
gold
glitters
but
it
is
as
noting
to
my
little
game
where
the
gold
does
not
glitter
because
it
is
pen
and
ink
a
pen
and
ink
soon
writes
ten
thousand
pounds
but
you
think
mush
of
it
when
you
win
two
hundred
pounds
at
roulette
i
think
nothing
of
it
said
our
friend
captain
scarborough
and
it
goes
into
your
pocket
to
give
champagne
to
the
ladies
instead
of
paying
your
debts
to
the
poor
fellows
who
have
supplied
you
for
so
long
with
all
de
money
all
this
occurred
in
the
at
a
distance
from
the
table
but
within
hearing
of
that
attendant
who
still
followed
the
player
these
moments
were
moments
of
misery
to
the
captain
in
spite
of
the
for
six
hundred
napoleons
which
were
still
in
his
breast
and
they
were
not
made
lighter
by
the
fact
that
all
the
words
spoken
by
the
jew
were
overheard
by
the
man
who
was
supposed
to
be
there
in
the
capacity
of
his
servant
but
the
man
as
it
seemed
had
a
mission
to
fulfil
and
was
the
captain
master
as
well
as
servant
hart
said
captain
scarborough
repressing
the
loudness
of
his
words
as
far
as
his
rage
would
admit
him
but
still
speaking
so
as
to
attract
the
attention
of
some
of
those
round
him
i
do
not
know
what
good
you
propose
to
yourself
by
following
me
in
this
manner
you
have
my
bonds
which
are
not
even
payable
till
my
father
death
ah
there
you
are
very
much
mistaken
and
are
then
only
payable
out
of
the
property
to
which
i
believed
myself
to
be
heir
when
the
money
was
borrowed
you
are
still
de
heir
de
heir
to
tretton
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
as
to
that
i
hope
when
the
time
comes
said
the
captain
you
be
able
to
prove
your
words
of
course
we
shall
prove
dem
why
not
your
father
and
your
brother
are
very
clever
shentlemen
i
think
but
they
will
not
be
more
clever
than
mishter
samuel
hart
tyrrwhit
also
is
a
clever
man
perhaps
he
understands
your
father
way
of
doing
business
perhaps
it
is
all
right
with
tyrrwhit
it
shall
be
all
right
with
me
too
i
swear
it
when
will
you
come
back
to
london
captain
scarborough
then
there
came
an
angry
dispute
in
the
during
which
hart
by
no
means
strove
to
repress
his
voice
captain
scarborough
asserted
his
rights
as
a
free
agent
declaring
himself
capable
as
far
as
the
law
was
concerned
of
going
wherever
he
pleased
without
reference
to
hart
and
told
that
gentleman
that
any
interference
on
his
part
would
be
regarded
as
an
impertinence
but
my
money
my
money
which
you
must
pay
this
minute
if
i
please
to
demand
it
you
did
not
lend
me
thousand
pounds
without
security
it
is
now
at
this
moment
take
it
get
it
go
and
put
it
in
your
pocket
you
have
a
lot
of
writings
turn
then
into
cash
at
once
take
them
to
any
other
jew
in
london
and
sell
them
see
if
you
can
get
your
thousand
pounds
for
them
or
thousand
shillings
you
certainly
can
not
get
pence
for
them
here
though
you
had
all
the
police
of
this
royal
kingdom
to
support
you
my
father
says
that
the
bonds
i
gave
you
are
not
worth
the
paper
on
which
they
were
written
if
you
are
cheated
so
have
i
been
if
he
has
robbed
you
so
has
he
me
but
i
have
not
robbed
you
and
you
can
do
nothing
to
me
i
vill
stick
to
you
like
beesvax
said
hart
while
the
look
of
left
his
countenance
for
a
moment
like
beesvax
you
shall
not
escape
me
again
you
will
have
to
follow
me
to
constantinople
then
i
vill
follow
you
to
the
devil
you
are
likely
to
go
before
me
there
but
for
the
present
i
am
off
to
constantinople
from
whence
i
intend
to
make
an
extended
tour
to
mount
caucasus
and
then
into
thibet
i
shall
be
very
glad
of
your
company
but
can
not
offer
to
pay
the
bill
when
you
and
your
companions
have
settled
yourselves
comfortably
at
tretton
i
shall
be
happy
to
come
and
see
you
there
you
will
have
to
settle
the
matter
first
with
my
younger
brother
if
i
may
make
bold
to
call
that
gentleman
my
brother
at
all
i
wish
you
a
mr
hart
upon
that
he
walked
out
into
the
hall
and
thence
down
the
steps
into
the
garden
in
front
of
the
establishment
his
own
attendant
following
him
hart
also
followed
him
but
did
not
immediately
seek
to
renew
the
conversation
if
he
meant
to
show
any
sign
of
keeping
his
threat
and
of
sticking
to
the
captain
like
beeswax
he
must
show
his
purpose
at
once
the
captain
for
a
time
walked
round
the
little
enclosure
in
earnest
conversation
with
the
attendant
and
hart
stood
on
the
steps
watching
them
play
was
over
at
any
rate
for
that
day
as
far
as
the
captain
was
concerned
now
captain
scarborough
do
you
think
you
been
very
rash
said
the
attendant
i
think
i
got
six
hundred
and
fifty
napoleons
in
my
pocket
instead
of
waiting
to
get
them
in
driblets
from
my
brother
but
if
he
knew
that
you
had
come
here
he
would
withdraw
them
altogether
of
course
he
will
know
now
that
man
will
be
sure
to
tell
him
he
will
let
all
london
know
of
course
it
would
be
so
when
you
came
to
a
place
of
such
common
resort
as
monte
carlo
common
resort
do
you
believe
he
came
here
as
to
a
place
of
common
resort
do
you
think
that
he
had
not
tracked
me
out
and
would
not
have
done
so
whether
i
had
gone
to
melbourne
or
new
york
or
petersburg
but
the
wonder
is
that
he
should
spend
his
money
in
such
a
vain
pursuit
ah
captain
you
do
not
know
what
is
vain
and
what
is
not
it
is
your
brother
pleasure
that
you
should
be
kept
in
the
dark
for
a
time
hang
my
brother
pleasure
why
am
i
to
follow
my
brother
pleasure
because
he
will
allow
you
an
income
he
will
keep
a
coat
on
your
back
and
a
hat
on
your
head
and
supply
meat
and
wine
for
your
needs
here
captain
scarborough
jingled
the
loose
napoleons
in
his
trousers
pocket
oh
yes
that
is
all
very
well
but
it
will
not
last
forever
indeed
it
will
not
last
for
a
week
unless
you
leave
monte
carlo
i
shall
leave
it
this
afternoon
by
the
train
for
genoa
and
where
shall
you
go
then
you
heard
me
suggest
to
hart
to
the
devil
or
else
constantinople
and
after
that
to
thibet
i
suppose
i
shall
still
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
your
company
augustus
wishes
that
i
should
remain
with
you
and
as
you
yourself
say
perhaps
it
will
be
best
chapter

harry
annesley
success
harry
annesley
a
day
or
two
after
he
had
left
tretton
went
down
to
cheltenham
for
he
had
received
an
invitation
to
a
dance
there
and
with
the
invitation
an
intimation
that
florence
mountjoy
was
to
be
at
the
dance
if
i
were
to
declare
that
the
dance
had
been
given
and
florence
asked
to
it
merely
as
an
act
of
friendship
to
harry
it
would
perhaps
be
thought
that
modern
friendship
is
seldom
carried
to
so
great
a
length
but
it
was
undoubtedly
the
fact
that
armitage
who
gave
the
dance
was
a
great
friend
and
admirer
of
harry
and
that
armitage
was
an
especial
chum
let
not
however
any
reader
suppose
that
florence
was
in
the
secret
armitage
had
thought
it
best
to
keep
her
in
the
dark
as
to
the
person
asked
to
meet
her
as
to
my
going
to
montpelier
place
harry
had
once
said
to
armitage
i
might
as
well
knock
at
a
mountjoy
lived
in
montpelier
place
i
think
we
could
perhaps
manage
that
for
you
armitage
had
replied
and
she
had
managed
it
is
she
coming
harry
said
to
armitage
in
an
anxious
whisper
as
he
entered
the
room
she
has
been
here
this
if
you
had
taken
the
trouble
to
leave
your
cigars
and
come
and
meet
her
she
has
not
gone
said
harry
almost
at
the
idea
no
she
is
sitting
like
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
in
the
room
inside
she
has
got
horrible
news
to
tell
you
oh
heavens
what
news
i
suppose
she
will
tell
you
though
she
has
not
been
communicative
to
me
in
regard
to
your
royal
highness
the
news
is
simply
that
her
mother
is
going
to
take
her
to
brussels
and
that
she
is
to
live
for
a
while
amid
the
ambassadorial
splendors
with
sir
magnus
and
his
wife
by
retiring
from
the
world
mountjoy
had
not
intended
to
include
such
slight
social
relaxations
as
armitage
party
for
harry
on
turning
round
encountered
her
talking
to
another
cheltenham
lady
he
greeted
her
with
his
pleasantest
smile
to
which
mountjoy
did
not
respond
quite
so
sweetly
she
had
ever
greatly
feared
harry
annesley
and
had
heard
a
story
very
much
as
she
thought
to
his
discredit
is
your
daughter
here
asked
harry
with
hypocrisy
mountjoy
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
florence
was
in
the
room
and
then
harry
passed
on
in
pursuit
of
his
quarry
oh
annesley
when
did
you
come
to
cheltenham
as
soon
as
i
heard
that
armitage
was
going
to
have
a
party
i
began
to
think
of
coming
immediately
then
an
idea
for
the
first
time
shot
through
florence
mind
that
her
friend
armitage
was
a
woman
devoted
to
intrigue
what
dance
have
you
disengaged
i
have
something
that
i
must
tell
you
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
will
not
give
me
one
dance
this
was
merely
a
lover
anxious
doubt
on
his
part
because
florence
had
not
at
once
replied
to
him
i
am
told
that
you
are
going
away
to
brussels
mamma
is
going
on
a
visit
to
her
and
you
with
her
of
course
i
shall
go
with
mamma
all
this
had
been
said
apart
while
a
lackadaisical
young
gentleman
was
standing
twiddling
his
thumbs
waiting
to
dance
with
florence
at
last
the
little
book
from
her
waist
was
brought
forth
and
harry
name
was
duly
inscribed
the
next
dance
was
a
quadrille
and
he
saw
that
the
space
after
that
was
also
vacant
so
he
boldly
wrote
down
his
name
for
both
i
almost
think
that
florence
must
have
suspected
that
harry
annesley
was
to
be
there
that
night
or
why
should
the
two
places
have
been
kept
vacant
and
now
what
is
this
he
began
about
your
going
to
brussels
mamma
brother
is
minister
there
and
we
are
just
going
on
a
visit
but
why
now
i
am
sure
there
is
some
especial
cause
florence
would
not
say
that
there
was
no
especial
cause
so
she
could
only
repeat
her
assertion
that
they
certainly
were
going
to
brussels
she
herself
was
well
aware
that
she
was
to
be
taken
out
of
harry
way
and
that
something
was
expected
to
occur
during
this
short
month
of
her
absence
which
might
be
detrimental
to
him
and
to
her
also
but
this
she
could
not
tell
nor
did
she
like
to
say
that
the
plea
given
by
her
mother
was
the
general
state
of
the
scarborough
affairs
she
did
not
wish
to
declare
to
this
lover
that
that
other
lover
was
as
nothing
to
her
and
how
long
are
you
to
be
away
asked
harry
we
shall
be
a
month
with
sir
magnus
but
mamma
is
talking
of
going
on
afterward
to
the
italian
lakes
good
heavens
you
will
not
be
back
i
suppose
till
ever
so
much
after
christmas
i
can
not
tell
nothing
as
yet
has
been
settled
i
do
not
know
that
i
ought
to
tell
you
anything
about
it
harry
at
this
moment
looked
up
and
caught
the
eye
of
mountjoy
as
she
was
standing
in
the
opposite
mountjoy
certainly
looked
as
though
no
special
communication
as
to
florence
future
movements
ought
to
be
made
to
harry
annesley
then
however
it
came
to
his
turn
to
dance
and
he
had
a
moment
allowed
to
him
to
collect
his
thoughts
by
nothing
that
he
could
do
or
say
could
he
prevent
her
going
and
he
could
only
use
the
present
moment
to
the
best
purpose
in
his
power
he
bethought
himself
then
that
he
had
never
received
from
her
a
word
of
encouragement
and
that
such
word
if
ever
to
be
spoken
should
be
forthcoming
that
night
what
might
not
happen
to
a
girl
who
was
passing
the
balmy
christmas
months
amid
the
sweet
shadows
of
an
italian
lake
harry
ideas
of
an
italian
lake
were
in
truth
at
present
somewhat
vague
but
future
months
were
to
his
thinking
interminable
the
present
moment
only
was
his
own
the
dance
was
now
finished
come
and
take
a
walk
said
harry
i
think
i
will
go
to
mamma
florence
had
seen
her
mother
eye
fixed
upon
her
oh
come
that
wo
do
at
all
said
harry
who
had
already
got
her
hand
within
his
arm
a
fellow
is
always
entitled
to
five
minutes
and
then
i
am
down
for
the
next
waltz
oh
no
but
i
am
and
you
ca
get
out
of
it
now
oh
florence
will
you
answer
me
a
question
one
question
i
asked
it
you
before
and
you
did
not
vouchsafe
me
any
answer
you
asked
me
no
question
said
florence
who
remembered
to
the
last
syllable
every
word
that
had
been
said
to
her
on
that
occasion
did
i
not
i
am
sure
you
knew
what
it
was
that
i
intended
to
ask
florence
could
not
but
think
that
this
was
quite
another
thing
oh
florence
can
you
love
me
had
she
given
her
ears
for
it
she
could
not
have
told
him
the
truth
then
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
her
eye
was
she
knew
watching
her
through
the
all
the
way
across
from
the
other
room
and
yet
had
her
mother
asked
her
she
would
have
answered
boldly
that
she
did
love
harry
annesley
and
intended
to
love
him
for
ever
and
ever
with
all
her
heart
and
she
would
have
gone
farther
if
and
have
declared
that
she
regarded
him
already
as
her
lord
and
master
but
now
she
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
him
all
she
knew
was
that
he
had
now
pledged
himself
to
her
and
that
she
intended
to
keep
him
to
his
pledge
may
i
not
have
one
word
he
said
one
word
what
could
he
want
with
a
word
more
thought
florence
her
silence
now
was
as
good
as
any
speech
but
as
he
did
want
more
she
would
after
her
own
way
reply
to
him
so
there
came
upon
his
arm
the
slightest
possible
sense
of
pressure
from
those
sweet
fingers
and
harry
annesley
was
on
a
sudden
carried
up
among
clouds
into
the
farthest
heaven
of
happiness
after
a
moment
he
stood
still
and
passed
his
fingers
through
his
hair
and
waved
his
head
as
a
god
might
do
it
she
had
now
made
to
him
a
solemn
promise
than
which
no
words
could
be
more
binding
oh
florence
he
exclaimed
i
must
have
you
alone
with
me
for
one
moment
for
what
could
he
want
her
alone
for
any
moment
thought
florence
there
was
her
mother
still
looking
at
them
but
for
her
harry
did
not
now
care
one
straw
nor
did
he
hate
those
bright
italian
lakes
with
nearly
so
strong
a
feeling
of
abhorrence
florence
you
are
now
all
my
own
there
came
another
slightest
pressure
slight
but
so
eloquent
from
those
fingers
i
hate
dancing
how
is
a
fellow
to
dance
now
i
shall
run
against
everybody
i
can
see
no
one
i
should
be
sure
to
make
a
fool
of
myself
no
i
do
want
to
dance
even
with
you
no
certainly
not
let
you
dance
with
somebody
else
and
you
engaged
to
me
well
if
i
must
of
course
i
must
i
declare
florence
you
have
not
spoken
a
single
word
to
me
though
there
is
so
much
that
you
must
have
to
say
what
have
you
got
to
say
what
a
question
to
ask
you
must
tell
me
oh
you
know
what
you
have
got
to
tell
me
the
sound
of
it
will
be
the
sweetest
music
that
a
man
can
possibly
hear
you
knew
it
all
harry
she
whispered
but
i
want
to
hear
it
oh
florence
florence
i
do
not
think
you
can
understand
how
completely
i
am
beyond
myself
with
joy
i
can
not
dance
again
and
will
not
oh
my
wife
my
wife
hush
said
florence
afraid
that
the
very
walls
might
hear
the
sound
of
harry
words
what
does
it
signify
though
all
the
world
knew
it
oh
yes
that
i
should
have
been
so
fortunate
that
is
what
i
can
not
understand
poor
mountjoy
i
do
feel
for
him
that
he
should
have
had
the
start
of
me
so
long
and
have
done
nothing
nothing
whispered
florence
and
i
have
done
everything
i
am
so
proud
of
myself
that
i
think
i
must
look
almost
like
a
hero
they
had
now
got
to
the
extremity
of
the
room
near
an
open
window
and
florence
found
that
she
was
able
to
say
one
word
you
are
my
hero
the
sound
of
this
nearly
drove
him
mad
with
joy
he
forgot
all
his
troubles
prodgers
the
policeman
augustus
scarborough
and
that
fellow
whom
he
hated
so
much
septimus
jones
what
were
they
all
to
him
now
he
had
set
his
mind
upon
one
thing
of
value
and
he
had
got
it
florence
had
promised
to
be
his
and
he
was
sure
that
she
would
never
break
her
word
to
him
but
he
felt
that
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
his
triumph
he
must
be
alone
somewhere
with
florence
for
five
minutes
he
had
not
actually
explained
to
himself
why
but
he
knew
that
he
wished
to
be
alone
with
her
at
present
there
was
no
prospect
of
any
such
five
minutes
but
he
must
say
something
in
preparation
for
some
future
five
minutes
at
a
time
to
come
perhaps
it
might
be
though
he
did
not
at
present
see
how
that
might
be
possible
for
mountjoy
he
knew
would
shut
her
door
against
him
and
mountjoy
was
already
prowling
round
the
room
after
her
daughter
harry
saw
her
as
he
got
florence
to
an
opposite
door
and
there
for
the
moment
escaped
with
her
and
now
he
said
how
am
i
to
manage
to
see
you
before
you
go
to
brussels
i
do
not
know
that
you
can
see
me
do
you
mean
that
you
are
to
be
shut
up
and
that
i
am
not
to
be
allowed
to
approach
you
i
do
mean
it
mamma
is
of
course
attached
to
her
nephew
what
after
all
that
has
passed
why
not
is
he
to
blame
for
what
his
father
has
done
harry
felt
that
he
could
not
press
the
case
against
captain
scarborough
without
some
want
of
generosity
and
though
he
had
told
florence
once
about
that
dreadful
midnight
meeting
he
could
say
nothing
farther
on
that
subject
of
course
mamma
thinks
that
i
am
foolish
but
why
he
asked
because
she
does
see
with
my
eyes
harry
we
need
not
say
anything
more
about
it
at
present
it
is
so
and
therefore
i
am
to
go
to
brussels
you
have
made
this
opportunity
for
yourself
before
i
start
perhaps
i
have
been
foolish
to
be
taken
off
my
guard
do
say
that
florence
i
shall
think
so
unless
you
can
be
discreet
harry
you
will
have
to
wait
you
will
remember
that
we
must
wait
but
i
shall
not
change
nor
i
nor
i
i
think
not
because
i
trust
you
here
is
mamma
and
now
i
must
leave
you
but
i
shall
tell
mamma
everything
before
i
go
to
bed
then
mountjoy
came
up
and
took
florence
away
with
a
few
words
of
most
disdainful
greeting
to
harry
annesley
when
florence
was
gone
harry
felt
that
as
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
stars
had
all
set
and
as
absolute
darkness
reigned
through
the
rooms
he
might
as
well
escape
into
the
street
where
there
was
no
one
but
the
police
to
watch
him
as
he
threw
his
hat
up
into
the
air
in
his
exultation
but
before
he
did
so
he
had
to
pass
by
armitage
and
thank
her
for
all
her
kindness
for
he
was
aware
how
much
she
had
done
for
him
in
his
present
circumstances
oh
armitage
i
am
so
obliged
to
you
no
fellow
was
ever
so
obliged
to
a
friend
before
how
has
it
gone
off
for
mountjoy
has
taken
florence
home
oh
yes
she
has
taken
her
away
but
she
has
shut
the
till
the
steed
has
been
stolen
oh
the
steed
has
been
stolen
yes
i
think
so
i
do
think
so
and
that
poor
man
who
has
disappeared
is
nowhere
men
who
disappear
never
are
anywhere
but
i
do
flatter
myself
that
if
he
had
held
his
ground
and
kept
his
property
the
result
would
have
been
the
same
i
dare
say
do
suppose
armitage
that
i
am
taking
any
pride
to
myself
why
on
earth
florence
should
have
taken
a
fancy
to
such
a
fellow
as
i
am
i
can
not
imagine
oh
no
not
in
the
least
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
armitage
but
as
i
have
thought
of
it
all
i
have
sometimes
been
in
despair
but
now
you
are
not
in
despair
no
indeed
just
now
i
am
triumphant
i
have
thought
so
often
that
i
was
a
fool
to
love
her
because
everything
was
so
much
against
me
i
have
wondered
that
you
continued
it
always
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
ghost
of
a
chance
for
you
armitage
bade
me
give
it
all
up
because
he
was
sure
you
would
never
do
any
good
i
do
care
how
much
you
laugh
at
me
mrs
armitage
let
those
laugh
who
win
then
he
rushed
out
into
the
paragon
and
absolutely
did
throw
his
hat
up
in
the
air
in
his
triumph
chapter
xiii
mountjoy
anger
florence
as
she
went
home
in
the
fly
with
her
mother
after
the
party
at
which
harry
had
spoken
to
her
so
openly
did
not
find
the
little
journey
very
happy
mountjoy
was
a
woman
endowed
with
a
strong
power
of
wishing
rather
than
of
willing
of
desiring
rather
than
of
contriving
but
she
was
one
who
could
make
herself
very
unpleasant
when
she
was
thwarted
her
daughter
was
now
at
last
fully
determined
that
if
she
ever
married
anybody
that
person
should
be
harry
annesley
having
once
pressed
his
arm
in
token
of
assent
she
had
as
it
were
given
herself
away
to
him
so
that
no
reasoning
no
expostulations
could
she
thought
change
her
purpose
and
she
had
much
more
power
of
bringing
about
her
purposed
design
than
had
her
mother
but
her
mother
could
be
obstinate
and
and
would
for
the
time
make
herself
disagreeable
florence
had
assured
her
lover
that
everything
should
be
told
her
mother
that
night
before
she
went
to
bed
but
mountjoy
did
not
wait
to
be
simply
told
no
sooner
were
they
seated
in
the
fly
together
than
she
began
to
make
her
inquiries
what
has
that
man
been
saying
to
you
she
demanded
florence
was
at
once
offended
by
hearing
her
lover
so
spoken
of
and
could
not
simply
tell
the
story
of
harry
successful
courtship
as
she
had
intended
mamma
she
said
why
do
you
speak
of
him
like
that
because
he
is
a
scamp
no
he
is
no
scamp
it
is
very
unkind
of
you
to
speak
in
such
terms
of
one
whom
you
know
is
very
dear
to
me
i
do
not
know
it
he
ought
not
to
be
dear
to
you
at
all
you
have
been
for
years
intended
for
another
purpose
this
was
intolerable
to
florence
this
idea
that
she
should
have
been
considered
as
capable
of
being
intended
for
the
purposes
of
other
people
and
a
resolution
at
once
was
formed
in
her
mind
that
she
would
let
her
mother
know
that
such
intentions
were
futile
but
for
the
moment
she
sat
silent
a
journey
home
at
twelve
at
night
in
a
fly
was
not
the
time
for
the
expression
of
her
resolution
i
say
he
is
a
scamp
said
mountjoy
during
all
these
inquiries
that
have
been
made
after
your
cousin
he
has
known
all
about
it
he
has
not
known
all
about
it
said
florence
you
contradict
me
in
a
very
impertinent
manner
and
can
not
be
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
the
last
person
who
saw
your
cousin
in
london
was
henry
annesley
and
yet
he
has
not
said
a
word
about
it
while
search
was
being
made
on
all
sides
and
he
saw
him
under
circumstances
most
suspicious
in
their
nature
so
suspicious
as
to
have
made
the
police
arrest
him
if
they
were
aware
of
them
he
had
at
that
moment
grossly
insulted
captain
scarborough
no
mamma
no
it
was
not
so
how
do
you
know
how
can
you
tell
i
do
know
and
i
can
tell
the
had
come
from
the
other
side
then
you
too
have
known
the
secret
and
have
said
nothing
about
it
you
too
have
been
aware
of
the
violence
which
took
place
at
that
midnight
meeting
you
have
been
aware
of
what
befell
your
cousin
the
man
to
whom
you
were
all
but
engaged
and
you
have
held
your
tongue
at
the
instigation
no
doubt
of
henry
annesley
oh
florence
you
also
will
find
yourself
in
the
hands
of
the
policeman
at
this
moment
the
fly
drew
up
at
the
door
of
the
house
in
montpelier
place
and
the
two
ladies
had
to
get
out
and
walk
up
the
steps
into
the
hall
where
they
were
congratulated
on
their
early
return
from
the
party
by
the
mamma
i
will
go
to
bed
said
florence
as
soon
as
she
reached
her
mother
room
i
think
you
had
better
my
dear
though
heaven
knows
what
disturbances
there
may
be
during
the
night
by
this
mountjoy
had
intended
to
imply
that
prodgers
the
policeman
might
probably
lose
not
a
moment
more
before
he
would
at
once
proceed
to
arrest
miss
mountjoy
for
the
steps
she
had
taken
in
regard
to
the
disappearance
of
captain
scarborough
she
had
heard
from
harry
annesley
the
fact
that
he
had
been
brutally
attacked
by
the
captain
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
the
streets
of
london
and
for
this
in
accordance
with
her
mother
theory
she
was
to
be
dragged
out
of
bed
by
a
constable
and
that
probably
before
the
next
morning
should
have
come
there
was
something
in
this
so
ludicrous
as
regarded
the
truth
of
the
story
and
yet
so
cruel
as
coming
from
her
mother
that
florence
hardly
knew
whether
to
cry
or
laugh
as
she
laid
her
head
upon
the
pillow
but
in
the
morning
as
she
was
thinking
that
the
facts
of
her
own
position
had
still
to
be
explained
to
her
mother
that
it
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
declare
her
purpose
and
the
impossibility
of
change
now
that
she
had
once
pledged
herself
to
her
lover
mountjoy
came
into
the
room
and
stood
at
her
bedside
with
that
appearance
of
ghostly
displeasure
which
always
belongs
to
an
angry
old
lady
in
a
well
mamma
florence
there
must
be
an
understanding
between
us
i
hope
so
i
thought
there
always
had
been
i
am
sure
mamma
you
have
known
that
i
have
never
liked
captain
scarborough
so
as
to
become
his
wife
and
i
think
you
have
known
that
i
have
liked
harry
annesley
likings
are
all
fiddlesticks
no
mamma
or
if
you
object
to
the
word
i
will
say
love
you
have
known
that
i
have
not
loved
my
cousin
and
that
i
have
loved
this
other
man
that
is
not
nonsense
that
at
any
rate
is
a
stern
reality
if
there
be
anything
real
in
the
world
stern
you
may
well
call
it
stern
i
mean
unbending
strong
not
to
be
overcome
by
outside
circumstances
if
annesley
had
not
spoken
to
me
as
he
did
last
night
could
never
have
so
spoken
to
me
i
should
have
been
a
miserable
girl
but
my
love
for
him
would
have
been
just
as
stern
i
should
have
remained
and
thought
of
it
and
have
been
unhappy
through
my
whole
life
but
he
has
spoken
and
i
am
exultant
that
is
what
i
mean
by
stern
all
that
is
most
important
at
any
rate
to
me
i
am
here
now
to
tell
you
that
it
is
impossible
very
well
mamma
then
things
must
go
on
and
we
must
bide
our
time
it
is
proper
that
i
should
tell
you
that
he
has
disgraced
himself
never
i
will
not
admit
it
you
do
not
know
the
circumstances
exclaimed
florence
it
is
most
impertinent
in
you
to
pretend
that
you
know
them
better
than
i
do
said
her
mother
indignantly
the
story
was
told
to
me
by
himself
yes
and
therefore
told
untruly
i
grieve
that
you
should
think
so
of
him
mamma
but
i
can
not
help
it
where
you
have
got
your
information
i
can
not
tell
but
that
mine
has
been
accurately
told
to
me
i
feel
certain
at
any
rate
my
duty
is
to
look
after
you
and
to
keep
you
from
harm
i
can
only
do
my
duty
to
the
best
of
my
ability
annesley
is
to
my
thinking
a
most
objectionable
young
man
and
he
will
i
believe
be
in
the
hands
of
the
police
before
long
evidence
will
have
to
be
given
in
which
your
name
will
unfortunately
be
mentioned
why
my
name
it
is
not
probable
that
he
will
keep
it
a
secret
when
as
to
his
having
divulged
the
story
to
some
one
he
will
declare
that
he
has
told
it
to
you
when
that
time
shall
come
it
will
be
well
that
we
should
be
out
of
the
country
i
propose
to
start
from
here
on
this
day
week
uncle
magnus
will
not
be
able
to
have
us
then
we
must
loiter
away
our
time
on
the
road
i
look
upon
it
as
quite
imperative
that
we
shall
both
be
out
of
england
within
eight
days
time
of
this
but
where
will
you
go
never
mind
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
as
yet
quite
made
up
my
mind
but
you
may
understand
that
we
shall
start
from
cheltenham
this
day
week
baker
will
go
with
us
and
i
shall
leave
the
other
two
servants
in
charge
of
the
house
i
can
not
tell
you
anything
farther
as
yet
except
that
i
will
never
consent
to
your
marriage
with
henry
annesley
you
had
better
know
that
for
certain
and
then
there
will
be
less
cause
for
unhappiness
between
us
so
saying
the
angry
ghost
with
the
on
stalked
out
of
the
room
it
need
hardly
be
explained
that
mountjoy
information
respecting
the
scene
in
london
had
come
to
her
from
augustus
scarborough
when
he
told
her
that
annesley
had
been
the
last
in
london
to
see
his
brother
mountjoy
and
had
described
the
nature
of
the
scene
that
had
occurred
between
them
he
had
no
doubt
forgotten
that
he
himself
had
subsequently
seen
his
brother
in
the
story
as
he
had
told
it
there
was
no
need
to
mention
himself
no
necessity
for
such
a
character
in
making
up
the
tragedy
of
that
night
no
doubt
according
to
his
idea
the
two
had
been
alone
together
harry
had
struck
the
blow
by
which
his
brother
had
been
injured
and
had
then
left
him
in
the
street
mountjoy
had
subsequently
disappeared
and
harry
had
told
to
no
one
that
such
an
encounter
had
taken
place
this
had
been
the
meaning
of
augustus
scarborough
when
he
informed
his
aunt
that
harry
had
been
the
last
who
had
seen
mountjoy
before
his
disappearance
to
mountjoy
the
fact
had
been
most
injurious
to
harry
character
harry
had
wilfully
kept
the
secret
while
all
the
world
was
at
work
looking
for
mountjoy
scarborough
and
as
far
as
mountjoy
could
understand
it
might
well
be
that
harry
had
struck
the
fatal
blow
that
had
sent
her
nephew
to
his
long
account
all
the
impossibilities
in
the
case
had
not
dawned
upon
her
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
mountjoy
could
not
have
been
killed
and
his
body
made
away
with
without
some
great
effort
in
the
performance
of
which
the
scamp
would
hardly
have
risked
his
life
or
his
character
but
the
scamp
was
certainly
a
scamp
even
though
he
might
not
be
a
murderer
or
he
would
have
revealed
the
secret
in
fact
mountjoy
believed
in
the
matter
exactly
what
augustus
had
intended
and
so
believing
had
resolved
that
her
daughter
should
suffer
any
purgatory
rather
than
become
harry
wife
but
her
daughter
made
her
resolutions
exactly
in
the
contrary
direction
she
in
truth
did
know
what
had
been
done
on
that
night
while
her
mother
was
in
ignorance
the
extent
of
her
mother
ignorance
she
understood
but
she
did
not
at
all
know
where
her
mother
had
got
her
information
she
felt
that
harry
secret
was
in
hands
other
than
he
had
intended
and
that
some
one
must
have
spoken
of
the
scene
it
occurred
to
florence
at
the
moment
that
this
must
have
come
from
mountjoy
himself
whom
she
believed
and
rightly
believed
to
have
been
the
only
second
person
present
on
the
occasion
and
if
he
had
told
it
to
any
one
then
must
that
any
one
know
where
and
how
he
had
disappeared
and
the
information
must
have
been
given
to
her
mother
solely
with
the
view
of
damaging
harry
character
and
of
preventing
harry
marriage
thinking
of
all
this
florence
felt
that
a
premeditated
and
foul
attempt
for
as
she
turned
it
in
her
mind
the
attempt
seemed
to
be
very
foul
was
being
made
to
injure
harry
a
false
accusation
was
brought
against
him
and
was
grounded
on
a
misrepresentation
of
the
truth
in
such
a
manner
as
to
subvert
it
altogether
to
harry
injury
it
should
have
no
effect
upon
her
to
this
determination
she
came
at
once
and
declared
to
herself
solemnly
that
she
would
be
true
to
it
an
attempt
was
made
to
undermine
him
in
her
estimation
but
they
who
made
it
had
not
known
her
character
she
was
sure
of
herself
now
within
her
own
bosom
that
she
was
bound
in
a
peculiar
way
to
be
more
than
ordinarily
true
to
harry
annesley
in
such
an
emergency
she
ought
to
do
for
harry
annesley
more
than
a
girl
in
common
circumstances
would
be
justified
in
doing
for
her
lover
harry
was
maligned
and
slandered
her
mother
had
been
induced
to
call
him
a
scamp
and
to
give
as
her
reason
for
doing
so
an
account
of
a
transaction
which
was
altogether
false
though
she
no
doubt
had
believed
it
to
be
true
as
she
thought
of
all
this
she
resolved
that
it
was
her
duty
to
write
to
her
lover
and
tell
him
the
story
as
she
had
heard
it
it
might
be
most
necessary
that
he
should
know
the
truth
she
would
write
her
letter
and
post
it
so
that
it
should
be
altogether
beyond
her
control
and
then
would
tell
her
mother
that
she
had
written
it
she
at
first
thought
that
she
would
keep
a
copy
of
the
letter
and
show
it
to
her
mother
but
when
it
was
written
those
first
words
intended
for
a
lover
eyes
which
had
ever
been
produced
by
her
pen
she
found
that
she
could
not
subject
those
very
words
to
her
mother
hard
judgment
her
letter
was
as
follows
dear
harry
you
will
be
much
surprised
at
receiving
a
letter
from
me
so
soon
after
our
meeting
last
night
but
i
warn
you
that
you
must
not
take
it
amiss
i
should
not
write
now
were
it
not
that
i
think
it
may
be
for
your
interest
that
i
should
do
so
i
do
not
write
to
say
a
word
about
my
love
of
which
i
think
you
may
be
assured
without
any
letter
i
told
mamma
last
night
what
had
occurred
between
us
and
she
of
course
was
very
angry
you
will
understand
that
knowing
how
anxious
she
has
been
on
behalf
of
my
cousin
mountjoy
she
has
always
taken
his
part
and
i
think
it
does
mamma
great
honor
not
to
throw
him
over
now
that
he
is
in
trouble
i
should
never
have
thrown
him
over
in
his
trouble
had
i
ever
cared
for
him
in
that
way
i
tell
you
that
fairly
master
harry
but
mamma
in
speaking
against
you
which
she
was
bound
to
do
in
supporting
poor
mountjoy
declared
that
you
were
the
last
person
who
had
seen
my
cousin
before
his
disappearance
and
she
knew
that
there
had
been
some
violent
struggle
between
you
indeed
she
knew
all
the
truth
as
to
that
night
except
that
the
attack
had
been
made
by
mountjoy
on
you
she
turned
the
story
all
round
declaring
that
you
had
attacked
him
which
as
you
perceive
gives
a
totally
different
appearance
to
the
whole
matter
somebody
has
told
her
though
who
it
may
have
been
i
can
not
guess
but
somebody
has
been
endeavoring
to
do
you
all
the
mischief
he
can
in
the
matter
and
has
made
mamma
think
evil
of
you
she
says
that
after
attacking
him
and
brutally
him
you
had
left
him
in
the
street
and
had
subsequently
denied
all
knowledge
of
having
seen
him
you
will
perceive
that
somebody
has
been
at
work
inventing
a
story
to
do
you
a
mischief
and
i
think
it
right
that
i
should
tell
you
but
you
must
never
believe
that
i
shall
believe
anything
to
your
discredit
it
would
be
to
my
discredit
now
i
know
that
you
are
good
and
true
and
noble
and
that
you
would
not
do
anything
so
foul
as
this
it
is
because
i
know
this
that
i
have
loved
you
and
shall
always
love
you
let
mamma
and
others
say
what
they
will
you
are
now
to
me
all
the
world
oh
harry
harry
when
i
think
of
it
how
serious
it
seems
to
me
and
yet
how
joyful
i
exult
in
you
and
will
do
so
let
them
say
what
they
may
against
you
you
will
be
sure
of
that
always
will
you
not
be
sure
of
it
but
you
must
not
write
a
line
in
answer
not
even
to
give
me
your
assurance
that
must
come
when
we
shall
meet
at
length
say
after
a
dozen
years
or
so
i
shall
tell
mamma
of
this
letter
which
circumstances
seem
to
demand
and
shall
assure
her
that
you
will
write
no
answer
to
it
oh
harry
you
will
understand
all
that
i
might
say
of
my
feelings
in
regard
to
you
your
own
florence
this
letter
when
she
had
written
it
and
copied
it
fair
and
posted
the
copy
in
the
close
by
she
found
that
she
could
not
in
any
way
show
absolutely
to
her
mother
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
it
had
become
a
and
what
genuine
can
a
girl
show
even
to
her
mother
but
she
at
once
told
her
of
what
she
had
done
mamma
i
have
written
a
letter
to
harry
annesley
you
have
yes
mamma
i
have
thought
it
right
to
tell
him
what
you
had
heard
about
that
night
and
you
have
done
this
without
my
permission
without
even
telling
me
what
you
were
going
to
do
if
i
had
asked
you
you
would
have
told
me
not
of
course
i
should
have
told
you
not
good
gracious
has
it
come
to
this
that
you
correspond
with
a
young
gentleman
without
my
leave
and
when
you
know
that
i
would
not
have
given
it
mamma
in
this
instance
it
was
necessary
who
was
to
judge
of
that
if
he
is
to
be
my
husband
but
he
is
not
to
be
your
husband
you
are
never
to
speak
to
him
again
you
shall
never
be
allowed
to
meet
him
you
shall
be
taken
abroad
and
there
you
shall
remain
and
he
shall
hear
nothing
about
you
if
he
attempts
to
correspond
with
you
he
will
not
how
do
you
know
i
have
told
him
not
to
write
told
him
indeed
much
he
will
mind
such
telling
i
shall
give
your
uncle
magnus
a
full
account
of
it
all
and
ask
for
his
advice
he
is
a
man
in
a
high
position
and
perhaps
you
may
think
fit
to
obey
him
although
you
utterly
refuse
to
be
guided
in
any
way
by
your
mother
then
the
conversation
for
the
moment
came
to
an
end
but
florence
as
she
left
her
mother
assured
herself
that
she
could
not
promise
any
close
obedience
in
any
such
matters
to
sir
magnus
chapter
xiv
they
arrive
in
brussels
for
some
weeks
after
the
party
at
armitage
house
and
the
subsequent
explanations
with
her
mother
florence
was
made
to
suffer
many
things
first
came
the
one
week
before
they
started
which
was
perhaps
the
worst
of
all
this
was
specially
embittered
by
the
fact
that
mountjoy
absolutely
refused
to
divulge
her
plans
as
they
were
made
there
was
still
a
fortnight
before
she
could
be
received
at
brussels
and
as
to
that
fortnight
she
would
tell
nothing
her
knowledge
of
human
nature
probably
went
so
far
as
to
teach
her
that
she
could
thus
most
torment
her
daughter
it
was
not
that
she
wished
to
torment
her
in
a
revengeful
spirit
she
was
quite
sure
within
her
own
bosom
that
she
did
all
in
love
she
was
devoted
to
her
daughter
but
she
was
thwarted
and
therefore
told
herself
that
she
could
best
farther
the
girl
interests
by
tormenting
her
it
was
not
meditated
revenge
but
that
revenge
which
springs
up
without
any
meditation
and
is
often
therefore
the
most
bitter
i
must
bring
her
nose
to
the
grindstone
was
the
manner
in
which
she
would
have
probably
expressed
her
thoughts
to
herself
consequently
florence
nose
was
brought
to
the
grindstone
and
the
operation
made
her
miserable
she
would
not
however
complain
when
she
had
discovered
what
her
mother
was
doing
she
asked
such
questions
as
appeared
to
be
natural
and
put
up
with
replies
which
purposely
withheld
all
information
mamma
have
you
not
settled
on
what
day
we
shall
start
no
my
dear
mamma
where
are
we
going
i
can
not
tell
you
as
yet
i
am
by
no
means
sure
myself
i
shall
be
glad
to
know
mamma
what
i
am
to
pack
up
for
use
on
the
journey
just
the
same
as
you
would
do
on
any
journey
then
florence
held
her
tongue
and
consoled
herself
with
thinking
of
harry
annesley
at
last
the
day
came
and
she
knew
that
she
was
to
be
taken
to
boulogne
before
this
time
she
had
received
one
letter
from
harry
full
of
love
full
of
thanks
just
what
a
lover
letter
ought
to
have
been
but
yet
she
was
disturbed
by
it
it
had
been
delivered
to
herself
in
the
usual
way
and
she
might
have
concealed
the
receipt
of
it
from
her
mother
because
the
servants
in
the
house
were
all
on
her
side
but
this
would
not
be
in
accordance
with
the
conduct
which
she
had
arranged
for
herself
and
she
told
her
mother
it
is
just
an
acknowledgment
of
mine
to
him
it
was
to
have
been
expected
but
i
regret
it
i
do
not
ask
to
see
it
said
mountjoy
angrily
i
could
not
show
it
you
mamma
though
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
of
it
i
do
not
ask
to
see
it
i
tell
you
i
never
wish
to
hear
his
name
again
from
your
tongue
but
i
knew
how
it
would
be
of
course
i
can
not
allow
this
kind
of
thing
to
go
on
it
must
be
prevented
it
will
not
go
on
mamma
but
it
has
gone
on
you
tell
me
that
he
has
already
written
do
you
think
it
proper
that
you
should
correspond
with
a
young
man
of
whom
i
do
not
approve
florence
endeavored
to
reflect
whether
she
did
think
it
proper
or
not
she
thought
it
quite
proper
that
she
should
love
harry
annesley
with
all
her
heart
but
was
not
quite
sure
as
to
the
correspondence
at
any
rate
you
must
understand
continued
mountjoy
that
i
will
not
permit
it
all
letters
while
we
are
abroad
must
be
brought
to
me
and
if
any
come
from
him
they
shall
be
sent
back
to
him
i
do
not
wish
to
open
his
letters
but
you
can
not
be
allowed
to
receive
them
when
we
are
at
brussels
i
shall
consult
your
uncle
upon
the
subject
i
am
very
sorry
florence
that
there
should
be
this
cause
of
quarrel
between
us
but
it
is
your
doing
oh
mamma
why
should
you
be
so
hard
i
am
hard
because
i
will
not
allow
you
to
accept
a
young
man
who
has
i
believe
behaved
very
badly
and
who
has
got
nothing
of
his
own
he
is
his
uncle
heir
we
know
what
that
may
come
to
mountjoy
was
his
father
heir
and
nothing
could
be
entailed
more
strictly
than
tretton
we
know
what
entails
have
come
to
there
prosper
will
find
some
way
of
escaping
from
it
entails
go
for
nothing
now
and
i
hear
that
he
thinks
so
badly
of
his
nephew
that
he
has
already
quarrelled
with
him
and
he
is
quite
a
young
man
himself
i
can
not
think
how
you
can
be
so
foolish
you
who
declared
that
you
are
throwing
your
cousin
over
because
he
is
no
longer
to
have
all
his
father
property
oh
mamma
that
is
not
true
very
well
my
dear
i
never
allowed
it
to
be
said
in
my
name
that
i
was
engaged
to
my
cousin
mountjoy
very
well
i
will
never
allow
it
to
be
said
in
my
name
that
with
my
consent
you
are
engaged
to
henry
annesley
six
or
seven
days
after
this
they
were
settled
together
most
uncomfortably
in
a
hotel
at
boulogne
mountjoy
had
gone
there
because
there
was
no
other
retreat
to
which
she
could
take
her
daughter
and
because
she
had
resolved
to
remove
her
from
beyond
the
sphere
of
harry
annesley
presence
she
had
at
first
thought
of
ostend
but
it
had
seemed
to
her
that
ostend
was
within
the
kingdom
reigned
over
by
sir
magnus
and
that
there
would
be
some
impropriety
in
removing
from
thence
to
the
capital
in
which
sir
magnus
was
reigning
it
was
as
though
you
were
to
sojourn
for
three
days
at
the
before
you
were
entertained
at
the
mansion
therefore
they
stayed
at
boulogne
and
mountjoy
tried
the
bathing
cold
as
the
water
was
with
equinoctial
gales
in
order
that
there
might
be
the
appearance
of
a
reason
for
her
being
at
boulogne
and
for
company
sake
in
the
hope
of
maintaining
some
fellowship
with
her
mother
florence
bathed
also
mamma
he
has
not
written
again
said
florence
coming
up
one
day
from
the
stand
i
suppose
that
you
are
impatient
why
should
there
be
a
quarrel
between
us
i
am
not
impatient
if
you
would
only
believe
me
it
would
be
so
much
more
happy
for
both
of
us
you
always
used
to
believe
me
that
was
before
you
knew
harry
annesley
there
was
something
in
this
very
aggravating
something
specially
intended
to
excite
angry
feelings
but
florence
determined
to
forbear
i
think
you
may
believe
me
mamma
i
am
your
own
daughter
and
i
shall
not
deceive
you
i
do
consider
myself
engaged
to
mr
annesley
you
need
not
tell
me
that
but
while
i
am
living
with
you
i
will
promise
not
to
receive
letters
from
him
without
your
leave
if
one
should
come
i
will
bring
it
to
you
unopened
so
that
you
may
deal
with
it
as
though
it
had
been
delivered
to
yourself
i
care
nothing
about
my
uncle
as
to
this
affair
what
he
may
say
can
not
affect
me
but
what
you
say
does
affect
me
very
much
i
will
promise
neither
to
write
nor
to
hear
from
annesley
for
three
months
will
not
that
satisfy
you
mountjoy
would
not
say
that
it
did
satisfy
her
but
she
somewhat
mitigated
her
treatment
of
her
daughter
till
they
arrived
together
at
sir
magnus
mansion
they
were
shown
through
the
great
hall
by
three
lackeys
into
an
inner
vestibule
where
they
encountered
the
great
man
himself
he
was
just
then
preparing
to
be
put
on
to
his
horse
and
lady
mountjoy
had
already
gone
forth
in
her
carriage
for
her
daily
airing
with
the
object
in
truth
of
avoiding
the
my
dear
sarah
said
sir
magnus
i
hope
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
and
my
niece
very
well
let
me
see
your
name
is
my
name
is
florence
said
the
young
lady
so
interrogated
ah
yes
to
be
sure
i
shall
forget
my
own
name
soon
if
any
one
was
to
call
me
magnus
without
the
i
should
know
whom
they
meant
then
he
looked
his
niece
in
the
face
and
it
occurred
to
him
that
anderson
might
not
improbably
desire
to
flirt
with
her
anderson
was
the
riding
attaché
who
always
accompanied
him
on
horseback
and
of
whom
lady
mountjoy
had
predicted
that
he
would
be
sure
to
flirt
with
the
minister
niece
at
that
moment
anderson
himself
came
in
and
some
ceremony
of
introduction
took
place
anderson
was
a
young
man
with
that
thorough
look
of
and
conceit
which
attachés
are
much
more
wont
to
exhibit
than
to
deserve
for
the
work
of
an
attaché
at
brussels
is
not
of
a
nature
to
bring
forth
the
highest
order
of
intellect
but
the
occupations
are
of
a
nature
to
make
a
young
man
feel
that
he
is
not
like
other
young
men
i
am
so
sorry
that
lady
mountjoy
has
just
gone
out
she
did
not
expect
you
till
the
later
train
you
have
been
staying
at
boulogne
what
on
earth
made
you
stay
at
boulogne
bathing
said
mountjoy
in
a
low
voice
ah
yes
i
suppose
so
why
did
you
not
come
to
ostend
there
is
better
bathing
there
and
i
could
have
done
something
for
you
what
the
horses
ready
are
they
i
must
go
out
and
show
myself
or
otherwise
they
all
think
that
i
am
dead
if
i
were
absent
from
the
boulevard
at
this
time
of
day
i
should
be
put
into
the
newspapers
where
is
mrs
richards
then
the
two
guests
with
their
own
special
baker
were
made
over
to
the
ministerial
and
sir
magnus
went
forth
upon
his
ride
she
a
pretty
girl
that
niece
of
mine
said
sir
magnus
uncommonly
pretty
said
the
attaché
but
i
believe
she
is
engaged
to
some
one
i
quite
forget
who
but
i
know
there
is
some
aspirant
therefore
you
had
better
keep
your
toe
in
your
pump
young
man
i
do
know
that
i
shall
keep
my
toe
in
my
pump
because
there
is
another
aspirant
said
anderson
you
rather
whet
my
ardor
sir
to
new
exploits
in
such
circumstances
one
is
inclined
to
think
that
the
aspirant
must
look
after
himself
not
that
i
conceive
for
a
moment
that
miss
mountjoy
should
ever
look
after
me
when
mountjoy
came
down
to
the
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
party
collected
to
enjoy
the
hospitality
of
sir
magnus
but
there
were
not
in
truth
many
more
than
the
usual
number
at
the
board
there
were
lady
mountjoy
and
miss
abbot
and
anderson
with
montgomery
arbuthnot
the
two
attachés
montgomery
arbuthnot
was
especially
proud
of
his
name
but
was
otherwise
rather
a
humble
young
man
as
an
attaché
having
as
yet
been
only
three
months
with
sir
magnus
and
desirous
of
perfecting
himself
in
foreign
office
manners
under
the
tuition
of
anderson
blow
secretary
of
legation
was
not
there
he
was
a
married
man
of
austere
manners
who
to
tell
the
truth
looked
down
from
a
considerable
height
as
regarded
foreign
office
knowledge
upon
his
chief
it
was
blow
who
did
the
grinding
on
behalf
of
the
belgian
legation
and
who
sometimes
did
not
hesitate
to
let
it
be
known
that
such
was
the
fact
neither
he
nor
blow
was
popular
at
the
embassy
or
it
may
perhaps
be
said
with
more
truth
that
the
embassy
was
not
popular
with
and
blow
it
may
be
stated
also
that
there
was
a
clerk
attached
to
the
establishment
bunderdown
who
had
been
there
for
some
years
and
who
was
regarded
by
the
english
inhabitants
as
a
third
attaché
montgomery
arbuthnot
did
his
best
to
let
it
be
understood
that
this
was
a
mistake
in
the
small
affairs
of
the
legation
which
no
doubt
did
not
go
beyond
the
legation
bunderdown
generally
sided
with
blow
montgomery
arbuthnot
was
recognized
as
a
second
mounted
attaché
though
his
attendance
on
the
boulevard
was
not
as
constant
as
that
of
anderson
in
consequence
probably
of
the
fact
that
he
had
not
a
horse
of
his
own
but
there
were
others
also
present
there
were
sir
thomas
tresham
with
his
wife
who
had
been
sent
over
to
inquire
into
the
iron
trade
of
belgium
he
was
a
learned
who
could
not
be
got
to
agree
with
the
old
familiar
views
of
sir
magnus
who
thought
that
the
more
iron
that
was
produced
in
belgium
the
less
would
be
forthcoming
from
england
but
sir
thomas
knew
better
and
as
sir
magnus
was
quite
unable
to
hold
his
own
with
the
political
economist
he
gave
him
many
dinners
and
was
civil
to
his
wife
sir
thomas
no
doubt
felt
that
in
doing
so
sir
magnus
did
all
that
could
be
expected
from
him
lady
tresham
was
a
quiet
little
woman
who
could
endure
to
be
patronized
by
lady
mountjoy
without
annoyance
and
there
was
grascour
from
the
belgian
foreign
office
who
spoke
english
so
much
better
than
the
other
gentlemen
present
that
a
stranger
might
have
supposed
him
to
be
a
whose
mission
it
was
to
instruct
the
english
embassy
in
their
own
language
oh
mrs
mountjoy
i
am
so
ashamed
of
myself
said
lady
mountjoy
as
she
waddled
into
the
room
two
minutes
after
the
guests
had
been
assembled
she
had
a
way
of
waddling
that
was
quite
her
own
and
which
they
who
knew
her
best
declared
that
she
had
adopted
in
lieu
of
other
graces
of
manner
she
puffed
a
little
also
and
did
contrive
to
attract
peculiar
attention
but
i
have
to
be
in
my
carriage
every
day
at
the
same
hour
i
do
know
what
would
be
thought
of
us
if
we
were
absent
then
she
turned
with
a
puff
and
a
waddle
to
miss
abbot
dear
lady
tresham
was
with
us
mountjoy
murmured
something
as
to
her
satisfaction
at
not
having
delayed
the
and
bethought
herself
how
exactly
similar
had
been
the
excuse
made
by
sir
magnus
himself
then
lady
mountjoy
gave
another
little
puff
and
assured
florence
that
she
hoped
she
would
find
brussels
sufficiently
gay
not
that
we
pretend
at
all
to
equal
paris
we
live
at
cheltenham
said
florence
and
that
is
not
at
all
like
paris
indeed
i
never
slept
but
two
nights
at
paris
in
my
life
then
we
shall
do
very
well
at
brussels
after
this
she
waddled
off
again
and
was
stopped
in
her
waddling
by
sir
magnus
who
sternly
desired
her
to
prepare
for
the
august
ceremony
of
going
in
to
dinner
the
one
period
of
real
importance
at
the
english
embassy
was
no
doubt
the
daily
florence
found
herself
seated
between
anderson
who
had
taken
her
in
and
grascour
who
had
performed
the
same
ceremony
for
her
ladyship
i
am
sure
you
will
like
this
little
capital
very
much
said
grascour
it
is
as
much
nicer
than
paris
as
it
is
smaller
and
less
pretentious
florence
could
only
assent
you
will
soon
be
able
to
learn
something
of
us
but
in
paris
you
must
be
to
the
manner
born
or
half
a
lifetime
will
not
suffice
we
put
you
up
to
the
time
of
day
said
anderson
who
did
not
choose
as
he
said
afterward
that
this
tidbit
should
be
taken
out
of
his
mouth
i
dare
say
that
all
that
i
shall
want
will
come
naturally
without
any
putting
up
you
wo
find
it
amiss
to
know
a
little
of
what
what
you
have
not
got
a
here
oh
no
said
florence
i
was
going
on
to
say
that
i
can
manage
to
secure
one
for
you
billibong
has
got
an
excellent
horse
that
carried
the
princess
of
styria
last
year
anderson
was
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
up
to
everything
concerning
horses
but
i
have
not
got
a
habit
that
is
a
much
more
serious
affair
well
yes
billibong
does
not
keep
habits
i
wish
he
did
but
we
can
manage
that
too
there
does
live
a
in
brussels
ladies
habits
certainly
are
made
in
brussels
said
grascour
but
if
miss
mountjoy
does
not
choose
to
trust
a
belgian
tailor
there
is
the
railway
open
to
her
an
english
habit
can
be
sent
dear
lady
centaur
had
one
sent
to
her
only
last
year
when
she
was
staying
here
said
lady
mountjoy
across
her
neighbor
with
two
little
puffs
i
shall
not
at
all
want
the
habit
said
florence
not
having
the
horse
and
indeed
never
being
accustomed
to
ride
at
all
do
tell
me
what
it
is
that
you
do
do
said
anderson
with
a
convenient
whisper
when
he
found
that
grascour
had
fallen
into
conversation
with
her
ladyship
i
do
play
at
though
i
am
not
wedded
to
it
billiards
i
know
you
play
billiards
i
never
struck
a
ball
in
my
life
goodness
gracious
how
odd
do
you
ever
amuse
yourself
at
all
are
they
so
very
devotional
down
at
cheltenham
i
suppose
we
are
stupid
i
do
know
that
i
ever
do
especially
amuse
myself
we
must
teach
you
we
really
must
teach
you
i
think
i
may
boast
of
myself
that
i
am
a
good
instructor
in
that
line
will
you
promise
to
put
yourself
into
my
hands
you
will
find
me
a
most
unpromising
pupil
not
in
the
least
i
will
undertake
that
when
you
leave
this
you
shall
be
at
everything
leap
frog
is
not
too
heavy
for
me
and
spillikins
not
too
light
i
am
up
to
them
all
from
backgammon
to
a
cotillon
not
but
what
i
prefer
the
cotillon
for
my
own
taste
or
perhaps
suggested
florence
well
yes
used
to
be
a
good
game
at
gother
school
and
i
do
see
why
we
should
have
it
back
again
ladies
of
course
must
have
a
costume
on
purpose
but
i
am
fond
of
anything
that
requires
a
costume
do
you
like
everything
out
of
the
common
way
i
do
florence
assured
him
that
their
tastes
were
wholly
dissimilar
as
she
liked
everything
in
the
common
way
that
what
i
call
an
uncommonly
pretty
girl
he
said
afterward
to
grascour
while
sir
magnus
was
talking
to
sir
thomas
what
an
eye
yes
indeed
she
is
very
lovely
my
word
you
may
say
that
and
such
a
turn
of
the
shoulders
i
say
which
are
the
as
a
rule
english
or
belgians
but
there
are
very
few
of
either
to
come
up
to
her
anderson
can
you
tell
us
how
many
tons
of
steel
rails
they
turn
out
at
liege
every
week
sir
thomas
asks
me
just
as
though
it
were
the
simplest
question
in
the
world
forty
million
said
anderson
more
or
less
twenty
thousand
would
perhaps
be
nearer
the
mark
said
grascour
but
i
will
send
him
the
exact
amount
chapter
xv
anderson
love
lady
mountjoy
had
certainly
prophesied
the
truth
when
she
said
that
anderson
would
devote
himself
to
florence
the
first
week
in
brussels
passed
by
quietly
enough
a
young
man
can
hardly
declare
his
passion
within
a
week
and
anderson
ways
in
that
particular
were
well
known
a
certain
amount
of
license
was
usually
given
to
him
both
by
sir
magnus
and
lady
mountjoy
and
when
he
would
become
remarkable
by
the
rapidity
of
his
changes
the
only
adverse
criticism
would
come
generally
from
blow
another
peerless
bird
of
paradise
blow
would
say
if
the
birds
were
less
numerous
anderson
might
perhaps
do
something
but
at
the
end
of
the
week
on
this
occasion
even
sir
magnus
perceived
that
anderson
was
about
to
make
himself
peculiar
by
george
he
said
one
morning
when
sir
magnus
had
just
left
the
outer
office
which
he
had
entered
with
the
object
of
giving
some
instruction
as
to
the
day
ride
take
her
altogether
i
never
saw
a
girl
so
fit
as
miss
mountjoy
there
was
something
very
remarkable
in
this
speech
as
according
to
his
usual
habit
of
life
anderson
would
certainly
have
called
her
florence
whereas
his
present
appellation
showed
an
unwonted
respect
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
a
young
lady
is
fit
said
blow
i
mean
that
she
is
right
all
round
which
is
a
great
deal
more
than
can
be
said
of
most
of
them
the
divine
florence
began
montgomery
arbuthnot
struggling
to
say
something
funny
young
man
you
had
better
hold
your
tongue
and
not
talk
of
young
ladies
in
that
language
i
do
believe
that
he
is
going
to
fall
in
love
said
blow
i
say
that
miss
mountjoy
is
the
fittest
girl
i
have
seen
for
many
a
day
and
when
a
young
puppy
calls
her
the
divine
florence
he
does
not
know
what
he
is
about
why
did
you
blow
blow
up
when
he
called
her
a
bird
of
paradise
said
montgomery
arbuthnot
divine
florence
is
not
half
so
disrespectful
of
a
young
lady
as
bird
of
paradise
divine
florence
means
divine
florence
but
bird
of
paradise
is
chaff
blow
as
a
married
man
said
anderson
has
a
certain
freedom
allowed
him
if
he
uses
it
in
bad
taste
the
evil
falls
back
upon
his
own
head
now
if
you
please
we
change
the
conversation
from
this
it
will
be
seen
that
anderson
had
really
fallen
in
love
with
miss
mountjoy
but
though
the
week
had
passed
in
a
harmless
way
to
sir
magnus
and
lady
mountjoy
in
a
harmless
way
to
them
as
regarded
their
niece
and
their
attaché
a
certain
amount
of
annoyance
had
no
doubt
been
felt
by
florence
herself
though
anderson
expressions
of
admiration
had
been
more
subdued
than
usual
though
he
had
endeavored
to
whisper
his
love
rather
than
to
talk
it
out
loud
still
the
admiration
had
been
both
visible
and
audible
and
especially
so
to
florence
herself
it
was
nothing
to
sir
magnus
with
whom
his
attaché
flirted
anderson
was
the
younger
son
of
a
baronet
who
had
a
sickly
elder
brother
and
some
fortune
of
his
own
if
he
chose
to
marry
the
girl
that
would
be
well
for
her
and
if
not
it
would
be
quite
well
that
the
young
people
should
amuse
themselves
he
expected
anderson
to
help
to
put
him
on
his
horse
and
to
ride
with
him
at
the
appointed
hour
he
in
return
gave
anderson
his
dinner
and
as
much
wine
as
he
chose
to
drink
they
were
both
satisfied
with
each
other
and
sir
magnus
did
not
choose
to
interfere
with
the
young
man
amusements
but
florence
did
not
like
being
the
subject
of
a
young
man
and
complained
to
her
mother
now
it
had
come
to
pass
that
not
a
word
had
been
said
as
to
harry
annesley
since
the
mother
and
daughter
had
reached
brussels
mountjoy
had
declared
that
she
would
consult
her
in
that
difficulty
but
no
such
consultation
had
as
yet
taken
place
indeed
florence
would
not
have
found
her
sojourn
at
brussels
to
be
unpleasant
were
it
not
for
anderson
unpalatable
little
whispers
she
had
taken
them
as
jokes
as
long
as
she
had
been
able
to
do
so
but
was
now
at
last
driven
to
perceive
that
other
people
would
not
do
so
mamma
she
said
do
you
think
that
that
anderson
is
an
odious
young
man
no
my
dear
by
no
means
what
is
there
odious
about
him
he
is
very
lively
he
is
the
second
son
of
sir
gregory
anderson
and
has
very
comfortable
means
of
his
own
oh
mamma
what
does
that
signify
well
my
dear
it
does
signify
in
the
first
place
he
is
a
gentleman
and
in
the
next
has
a
right
to
make
himself
attentive
to
any
young
lady
in
your
position
i
do
say
anything
more
i
am
not
particularly
wedded
to
anderson
if
he
were
to
come
to
me
and
ask
for
my
permission
to
address
you
i
should
simply
refer
him
to
yourself
by
which
i
should
mean
to
imply
that
if
he
could
contrive
to
recommend
himself
to
you
i
should
not
refuse
my
sanction
then
the
subject
for
that
moment
dropped
but
florence
was
astonished
to
find
that
her
mother
could
talk
about
it
not
only
without
reference
to
harry
annesley
but
also
without
an
apparent
thought
of
mountjoy
scarborough
and
it
was
distressing
to
her
to
think
that
her
mother
should
pretend
to
feel
that
she
her
own
daughter
should
be
free
to
receive
the
advances
of
another
suitor
as
she
reflected
it
came
across
her
mind
that
harry
was
so
odious
that
her
mother
would
have
been
willing
to
accept
on
her
behalf
any
suitor
who
presented
himself
even
though
her
daughter
in
accepting
him
should
have
proved
herself
to
be
heartless
any
alternative
would
have
been
better
to
her
mother
than
that
choice
to
which
florence
had
determined
to
devote
her
whole
life
mamma
she
said
going
back
to
the
subject
on
the
next
day
if
i
am
to
stay
here
for
three
weeks
longer
yes
my
dear
you
are
to
stay
here
for
three
weeks
longer
then
somebody
must
say
something
to
mr
anderson
i
do
not
see
who
can
say
it
but
you
yourself
as
far
as
i
can
see
he
has
not
misbehaved
i
wish
you
would
speak
to
my
uncle
what
am
i
to
tell
him
that
i
am
engaged
he
would
ask
me
to
whom
and
i
can
not
tell
him
i
should
then
be
driven
to
put
the
whole
case
in
his
hands
and
to
ask
his
advice
you
do
not
suppose
that
i
am
going
to
say
that
you
are
engaged
to
marry
that
odious
young
man
all
the
world
knows
how
atrociously
badly
he
has
behaved
to
your
own
cousin
he
left
him
lying
for
dead
in
the
street
by
a
blow
from
his
own
hand
and
though
from
that
day
to
this
nothing
has
been
heard
of
mountjoy
nothing
is
known
to
the
police
of
what
may
have
been
his
fate
even
stranger
he
may
have
perished
under
the
usage
which
he
received
yet
annesley
has
not
thought
it
right
to
say
a
word
of
what
had
occurred
he
has
not
dared
even
to
tell
an
inspector
of
police
the
events
of
that
night
and
the
young
man
was
your
own
cousin
to
whom
you
were
known
to
have
been
promised
for
the
last
two
years
no
no
said
florence
i
say
that
it
was
so
you
were
promised
to
your
cousin
mountjoy
scarborough
not
with
my
own
consent
all
your
friends
your
natural
friends
knew
that
it
was
to
be
so
and
now
you
expect
me
to
take
by
the
hand
this
young
man
who
has
almost
been
his
murderer
no
mamma
it
is
not
true
you
do
not
know
the
circumstances
and
you
assert
things
which
are
directly
at
variance
with
the
truth
from
whom
do
you
get
your
information
from
the
young
man
himself
is
that
likely
to
be
true
what
would
sir
magnus
say
as
to
that
were
i
to
tell
him
i
do
not
know
what
he
would
say
but
i
do
know
what
is
the
truth
and
can
you
think
it
possible
that
i
should
now
be
willing
to
accept
this
foolish
young
man
in
order
thus
to
put
an
end
to
my
embarrassments
then
she
left
her
mother
room
and
retreating
to
her
own
sat
for
a
couple
of
hours
thinking
partly
in
anger
and
partly
in
grief
of
the
troubles
of
her
situation
her
mother
had
now
in
truth
frightened
her
as
to
harry
position
she
did
begin
to
see
what
men
might
say
of
him
and
the
way
in
which
they
might
speak
of
his
silence
though
she
was
resolved
to
be
as
true
to
him
in
her
faith
as
ever
some
exertion
of
spirit
would
indeed
be
necessary
she
was
beginning
to
understand
in
what
way
the
outside
world
might
talk
of
harry
annesley
of
the
man
to
whom
she
had
given
herself
and
her
whole
heart
then
her
mother
was
right
and
as
she
thought
of
it
she
began
to
justify
her
mother
it
was
natural
that
her
mother
should
believe
the
story
which
had
been
told
to
her
let
it
have
come
from
where
it
might
there
was
in
her
mind
some
suspicion
of
the
truth
she
acknowledged
a
great
animosity
to
her
cousin
augustus
and
regarded
him
as
one
of
the
causes
of
her
unhappiness
but
she
knew
nothing
of
the
real
facts
she
did
not
even
suspect
that
augustus
had
seen
his
brother
after
harry
had
dealt
with
him
or
that
he
was
responsible
for
his
brother
absence
but
she
knew
that
she
disliked
him
and
in
some
way
she
connected
his
name
with
misfortune
of
one
thing
she
was
certain
let
them
the
mountjoys
and
prospers
and
the
rest
of
the
world
think
and
say
what
they
would
of
harry
she
would
be
true
to
him
she
could
understand
that
his
character
might
be
made
to
suffer
but
it
should
not
suffer
in
her
estimation
or
rather
let
it
suffer
ever
so
that
should
not
affect
her
love
and
her
truth
she
did
not
say
this
to
herself
by
saying
it
even
to
herself
she
would
have
committed
some
default
of
truth
she
did
not
whisper
it
even
to
her
own
heart
but
within
her
heart
there
was
a
feeling
that
let
harry
be
right
or
wrong
in
what
he
had
done
even
let
it
be
proved
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
the
world
that
he
had
sinned
grievously
when
he
had
left
the
man
stunned
and
bleeding
on
the
pavement
for
to
such
details
her
story
had
gone
still
to
her
he
should
be
braver
more
noble
more
manly
more
worthy
of
being
loved
than
was
any
other
man
she
perceiving
the
difficulties
that
were
in
store
for
her
and
looking
forward
to
the
misfortune
under
which
harry
might
be
placed
declared
to
herself
that
he
should
at
least
have
one
friend
who
would
be
true
to
him
miss
mountjoy
i
have
come
to
you
with
a
message
from
your
aunt
this
was
said
three
or
four
days
after
the
conversation
between
florence
and
her
mother
by
anderson
who
had
contrived
to
follow
the
young
lady
into
a
small
after
luncheon
what
was
the
nature
of
the
message
it
is
not
necessary
for
us
to
know
we
may
be
sure
that
it
had
been
manufactured
by
anderson
for
the
occasion
he
had
looked
about
and
spied
and
had
discovered
that
miss
mountjoy
was
alone
in
the
little
room
and
in
thus
spying
we
consider
him
to
have
been
perfectly
justified
his
business
at
the
moment
was
that
of
making
love
a
business
which
is
allowed
to
override
all
other
considerations
even
the
making
an
office
copy
of
a
report
made
by
blow
for
the
signature
of
sir
magnus
might
according
to
our
view
of
life
have
been
properly
laid
aside
for
such
a
purpose
when
a
young
man
has
it
in
him
to
make
love
to
a
young
lady
and
is
earnest
in
his
intention
no
duty
however
paramount
should
be
held
as
a
restraint
such
was
intention
at
the
present
moment
and
therefore
we
think
that
he
was
justified
in
concocting
a
message
from
lady
mountjoy
the
business
of
warrants
any
concoction
to
which
the
lover
may
resort
but
oh
miss
mountjoy
i
am
so
glad
to
have
a
moment
in
which
i
can
find
you
alone
it
must
be
understood
that
the
amorous
young
gentleman
had
not
yet
been
acquainted
with
the
young
lady
for
quite
a
fortnight
i
was
just
about
to
go
to
my
mother
said
florence
rising
to
leave
the
room
oh
bother
your
mother
i
beg
her
pardon
and
yours
i
really
mean
it
there
is
such
a
lot
of
chaff
going
on
in
that
outer
room
that
a
fellow
falls
into
the
way
of
it
whether
he
likes
it
or
no
my
mother
wo
mind
it
at
all
but
i
really
must
go
oh
no
i
am
sure
you
can
wait
for
five
minutes
i
do
want
to
keep
you
for
more
than
five
minutes
but
it
is
so
hard
for
a
fellow
to
get
an
opportunity
to
say
a
few
words
what
words
can
you
want
to
say
to
me
mr
anderson
this
she
said
with
a
look
of
great
surprise
as
though
utterly
unable
to
imagine
what
was
to
follow
well
i
did
hope
that
you
might
have
some
idea
of
what
my
feelings
are
not
in
the
least
have
you
now
i
suppose
i
am
bound
to
believe
you
though
i
doubt
whether
i
quite
do
pray
excuse
me
for
saying
this
but
it
is
best
to
be
open
florence
felt
that
he
ought
to
be
excused
for
doubting
her
as
she
did
know
very
well
what
was
coming
i
i
come
then
i
love
you
if
i
were
to
go
on
beating
about
the
bush
for
twelve
months
i
could
only
come
to
the
same
conclusion
perhaps
you
might
then
have
considered
it
better
not
in
the
least
fancy
considering
such
a
thing
as
that
for
twelve
months
before
you
speak
of
it
i
could
do
it
not
for
twelve
days
so
i
perceive
mr
anderson
well
is
it
best
to
speak
the
truth
when
you
quite
sure
of
it
if
i
were
to
remain
dumb
for
three
months
how
should
i
know
but
what
some
one
else
might
come
in
the
way
but
you
ca
expect
that
i
should
be
so
sudden
that
just
where
it
is
of
course
i
do
and
yet
girls
have
to
be
sudden
too
have
they
they
expected
to
be
ready
with
their
answer
as
soon
as
asked
i
do
say
this
by
way
of
impertinence
but
merely
to
show
that
i
have
some
justification
of
course
if
you
like
to
say
that
you
must
take
a
week
to
think
of
it
i
am
prepared
for
that
only
let
me
tell
my
own
story
first
you
shall
tell
your
own
story
anderson
but
i
am
afraid
that
it
can
be
to
no
purpose
do
say
that
pray
do
say
that
but
do
let
me
tell
it
then
he
paused
but
as
she
remained
silent
after
a
moment
he
resumed
the
eloquence
of
his
appeal
by
george
miss
mountjoy
i
have
been
so
struck
of
a
heap
that
i
do
not
know
whether
i
am
standing
on
my
head
or
my
heels
you
have
knocked
me
so
completely
off
my
pins
that
i
am
not
at
all
like
the
same
person
sir
magnus
himself
says
that
he
never
saw
such
a
difference
i
only
say
that
to
show
that
i
am
quite
in
earnest
now
i
am
not
quite
like
a
fellow
that
has
no
business
to
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
i
have
four
hundred
a
year
besides
my
place
in
the
foreign
office
and
then
of
course
there
are
chances
in
this
he
alluded
to
his
brother
failing
health
of
which
he
could
not
explain
the
details
to
miss
mountjoy
on
the
present
occasion
i
do
mean
to
say
that
this
is
very
splendid
or
that
it
is
half
what
i
should
like
to
lay
at
your
feet
but
a
competence
is
comfortable
money
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
mr
anderson
what
then
perhaps
it
is
that
you
do
like
a
fellow
what
girls
generally
do
like
is
devotion
and
by
george
you
have
that
the
very
ground
that
you
tread
upon
is
sweet
to
me
for
beauty
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
to
my
taste
there
is
no
one
i
ever
saw
at
all
like
you
you
fit
me
well
as
though
you
were
made
for
me
i
know
that
another
fellow
might
say
it
a
deal
better
but
no
one
more
truly
miss
mountjoy
i
love
you
with
all
my
heart
and
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
now
you
got
it
he
had
not
pleaded
his
cause
badly
and
so
florence
felt
that
he
had
pleaded
it
hopelessly
was
a
matter
of
course
but
he
had
given
rise
to
feelings
of
gentle
regard
rather
than
of
anger
he
had
been
honest
and
had
contrived
to
make
her
believe
him
he
did
not
come
up
to
her
ideal
of
what
a
lover
should
be
but
he
was
nearer
to
it
than
mountjoy
scarborough
he
had
touched
her
so
closely
that
she
determined
at
once
to
tell
him
the
truth
thinking
that
she
might
best
in
this
way
put
an
end
to
his
passion
forever
anderson
she
said
though
i
have
known
it
to
be
vain
i
have
thought
it
best
to
listen
to
you
because
you
asked
it
i
am
sure
i
am
awfully
obliged
to
you
and
i
ought
to
thank
you
for
the
kind
feeling
you
have
expressed
to
me
indeed
i
do
thank
you
i
believe
every
word
you
have
said
it
is
better
to
show
my
confidence
in
your
truth
than
to
pretend
to
the
humility
of
thinking
you
untrue
it
is
true
it
is
true
every
word
of
it
but
i
am
engaged
then
it
was
sad
to
see
the
thorough
change
which
came
over
the
young
man
face
of
course
a
girl
does
not
talk
of
her
own
little
affairs
to
strangers
or
i
would
let
you
have
known
this
before
so
as
to
have
prevented
it
but
in
truth
i
am
engaged
does
sir
magnus
know
it
or
lady
mountjoy
i
should
think
not
does
your
mother
now
you
are
taking
advantage
of
my
confidence
and
pressing
your
questions
too
closely
but
my
mother
does
know
of
it
i
will
tell
you
more
she
does
not
approve
of
it
but
it
is
fixed
in
heaven
itself
it
may
well
be
that
i
shall
never
be
able
to
marry
the
gentleman
to
whom
i
allude
but
most
certainly
i
shall
marry
no
one
else
i
have
told
you
this
because
it
seems
to
be
necessary
to
your
welfare
so
that
you
may
get
over
this
passing
feeling
it
is
no
passing
feeling
said
anderson
with
some
tragic
grandeur
at
any
rate
you
have
now
my
story
and
remember
that
it
is
trusted
to
you
as
a
gentleman
i
have
told
it
you
for
a
purpose
then
she
walked
out
of
the
room
leaving
the
poor
young
man
in
temporary
despair
chapter
xvi
and
miss
grey
it
was
now
the
middle
of
october
and
it
may
be
said
that
from
the
time
in
which
old
scarborough
had
declared
his
intention
of
showing
that
the
elder
of
his
sons
had
no
right
to
the
property
grey
the
lawyer
had
been
so
occupied
with
the
scarborough
affairs
as
to
have
had
left
him
hardly
a
moment
for
other
considerations
he
had
a
partner
who
during
these
four
months
had
in
fact
carried
on
the
business
one
difficulty
had
grown
out
of
another
till
whole
time
had
been
occupied
and
all
his
thoughts
had
been
filled
with
scarborough
which
is
a
matter
of
much
greater
moment
to
a
man
than
the
loss
of
his
time
the
question
of
mountjoy
scarborough
position
had
been
first
submitted
to
him
in
june
october
had
now
been
reached
and
grey
had
been
out
of
town
only
for
a
fortnight
during
which
fortnight
he
had
been
occupied
entirely
in
unravelling
the
mystery
he
had
at
first
refused
altogether
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
unravelling
and
had
desired
that
some
other
lawyer
might
be
employed
but
it
had
gradually
come
to
pass
that
he
had
entered
heart
and
soul
into
the
case
and
with
many
execrations
on
his
own
part
against
scarborough
could
find
a
real
interest
in
nothing
else
he
had
begun
his
investigations
with
a
thorough
wish
to
discover
that
mountjoy
scarborough
was
in
truth
the
heir
though
he
had
never
loved
the
young
man
and
as
he
went
on
with
his
investigations
became
aware
that
the
whole
property
would
go
to
the
creditors
should
he
succeed
in
proving
that
mountjoy
was
the
heir
yet
for
the
sake
of
abstract
honesty
he
was
most
anxious
that
it
should
be
so
and
he
could
not
bear
to
think
that
he
and
other
lawyers
had
been
taken
in
by
the
wily
craft
of
such
a
man
as
the
squire
of
tretton
it
went
thoroughly
against
the
grain
with
him
to
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
estate
would
become
the
property
of
augustus
but
it
was
so
and
he
did
acknowledge
it
it
was
proved
to
him
that
in
spite
of
all
the
evidence
which
he
had
hitherto
seen
in
the
matter
the
squire
had
not
married
his
wife
until
after
the
birth
of
his
eldest
son
he
did
acknowledge
it
and
he
said
bravely
that
it
must
be
so
then
there
came
down
upon
him
a
crowd
of
enemies
in
the
guise
of
baffled
creditors
all
of
whom
believed
or
professed
to
believe
that
he
grey
was
in
league
with
the
squire
to
rob
them
of
their
rights
if
it
could
be
proved
that
mountjoy
had
no
claim
to
the
property
then
would
it
go
nominally
to
augustus
who
according
to
their
showing
was
also
one
of
the
confederates
and
the
property
could
thus
they
said
be
divided
very
shortly
the
squire
would
be
dead
and
then
the
confederates
would
get
everything
to
the
utter
exclusion
of
poor
tyrrwhit
and
poor
samuel
hart
and
all
the
other
poor
creditors
who
would
thus
be
denuded
defrauded
and
robbed
by
a
lawyer
trick
it
was
in
this
spirit
that
grey
was
attacked
by
tyrrwhit
and
the
others
and
grey
found
it
very
hard
to
bear
and
then
there
was
another
matter
which
was
also
very
grievous
to
him
if
it
were
as
he
now
stated
if
the
squire
had
been
guilty
of
this
fraud
to
what
punishment
would
he
be
subjected
mountjoy
was
declared
to
have
been
innocent
tyrrwhit
as
he
put
the
case
to
his
own
lawyers
laughed
bitterly
as
he
made
this
suggestion
and
augustus
was
of
course
innocent
then
there
was
renewed
laughter
and
grey
grey
had
of
course
been
innocent
then
the
laughter
was
very
loud
was
it
to
be
believed
that
anybody
could
be
taken
in
by
such
a
story
as
this
there
was
he
tyrrwhit
he
had
ever
been
known
as
a
sharp
fellow
and
samuel
hart
who
was
now
away
on
his
travels
and
the
others
they
were
all
of
them
sharp
fellows
was
it
to
be
believed
that
such
a
set
of
gentlemen
so
keenly
alive
to
their
own
interest
should
be
made
the
victims
of
such
a
trick
as
this
not
if
they
knew
it
not
if
tyrrwhit
knew
it
it
was
in
this
shape
that
the
matter
reached
grey
ears
and
then
it
was
asked
if
it
were
so
what
would
be
the
punishment
to
which
they
would
be
subjected
who
had
defrauded
tyrrwhit
of
his
just
claim
tyrrwhit
who
on
one
occasion
made
his
way
into
grey
presence
wished
to
get
an
answer
to
that
question
from
grey
the
man
is
dying
said
grey
solemnly
dying
he
is
not
more
likely
to
die
than
you
are
from
all
i
hear
at
this
time
rumors
of
scarborough
improved
health
had
reached
the
creditors
in
london
tyrrwhit
had
begun
to
believe
that
scarborough
dangerous
condition
had
been
part
of
the
hoax
that
there
had
been
no
surgeon
knives
no
terrible
operations
no
moment
of
almost
certain
death
i
do
believe
he
been
ill
at
all
said
tyrrwhit
i
can
not
help
your
belief
said
grey
but
because
a
man
does
die
and
recovers
is
he
on
that
account
to
be
allowed
to
cheat
people
as
he
has
cheated
me
with
impunity
i
am
not
going
to
defend
scarborough
but
he
has
not
in
fact
cheated
you
who
has
come
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
if
this
goes
on
i
shall
not
have
been
defrauded
of
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
did
you
ever
see
scarborough
on
the
matter
no
it
was
not
necessary
or
have
you
got
his
writing
to
any
document
have
you
anything
to
show
that
he
knew
what
his
son
was
doing
when
he
borrowed
money
of
you
is
it
not
perfectly
clear
that
he
knew
nothing
about
it
of
course
he
knew
nothing
about
it
then
at
that
time
it
was
afterward
that
his
fraud
began
when
he
found
that
the
estate
was
in
jeopardy
then
the
falsehood
was
concocted
ah
there
tyrrwhit
i
can
only
say
that
i
disagree
with
you
i
must
express
my
opinion
that
if
you
endeavor
to
recover
your
money
on
that
plea
you
will
be
beaten
if
you
can
prove
fraud
of
that
kind
no
doubt
you
can
punish
those
who
have
been
guilty
of
it
me
among
the
number
i
say
nothing
of
that
said
tyrrwhit
but
if
you
have
been
led
into
your
present
difficulty
by
an
illegal
attempt
on
the
part
of
my
client
to
prove
an
illegitimate
son
to
have
been
legitimate
and
then
to
have
changed
his
mind
for
certain
purposes
i
do
not
see
how
you
are
to
punish
him
the
act
will
have
been
attempted
and
not
completed
and
it
will
have
been
an
act
concerning
his
son
and
not
concerning
you
not
concerning
me
shrieked
tyrrwhit
certainly
not
legally
you
are
not
in
a
position
to
prove
that
he
knew
that
his
son
was
borrowing
money
from
you
on
the
credit
of
the
estate
as
a
fact
he
certainly
did
not
know
it
we
shall
see
about
that
said
tyrrwhit
then
you
must
see
about
it
but
not
with
my
aid
as
a
fact
i
am
telling
you
all
that
i
know
about
it
if
i
could
i
would
prove
mountjoy
scarborough
to
be
his
father
heir
indeed
i
am
altogether
on
your
side
in
the
matter
if
you
would
believe
it
here
tyrrwhit
again
laughed
but
you
will
not
believe
it
and
i
do
not
ask
you
to
do
so
as
it
is
we
must
be
opposed
to
each
other
where
is
the
young
man
asked
tyrrwhit
ah
that
is
a
question
i
am
not
bound
to
answer
even
if
i
knew
it
is
a
matter
on
which
i
say
nothing
you
have
lent
him
money
at
an
exorbitant
rate
of
interest
it
is
not
true
at
any
rate
it
seems
so
to
me
and
it
is
out
of
the
question
that
i
should
assist
you
in
recovering
it
you
did
it
at
your
own
peril
and
not
on
my
advice
mr
tyrrwhit
then
tyrrwhit
went
his
way
not
without
sundry
threats
as
to
the
whole
scarborough
family
it
was
very
hard
upon
grey
because
he
certainly
was
an
honest
man
and
had
taken
up
the
matter
simply
with
a
view
of
learning
the
truth
it
had
been
whispered
to
him
within
the
last
day
or
two
that
mountjoy
scarborough
had
lately
been
seen
alive
and
gambling
with
reckless
prodigality
at
monte
carlo
it
had
only
been
told
to
him
as
probably
true
but
he
certainly
believed
it
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
details
of
his
disappearance
and
had
not
been
much
surprised
as
he
had
never
believed
that
the
young
man
had
been
murdered
or
had
made
away
with
himself
but
he
had
heard
before
that
of
the
quarrel
in
the
street
between
him
and
harry
annesley
and
the
story
had
been
told
to
him
so
as
to
fall
with
great
discredit
on
harry
annesley
head
according
to
that
story
harry
annesley
had
struck
his
foe
during
the
night
and
had
left
him
for
dead
upon
the
pavement
then
mountjoy
scarborough
had
been
missing
and
harry
annesley
had
told
no
one
of
the
quarrel
there
had
been
some
girl
in
question
so
much
and
no
more
grey
had
heard
and
was
of
course
inclined
to
think
that
harry
annesley
must
have
behaved
very
badly
but
of
the
mode
of
subsequent
escape
he
had
heard
nothing
grey
at
this
time
was
living
down
at
fulham
in
a
small
house
which
the
river
and
was
called
the
he
would
have
said
that
it
was
his
custom
to
go
home
every
day
by
an
omnibus
but
he
did
in
truth
almost
always
remain
at
his
office
so
late
as
to
make
it
necessary
that
he
should
return
by
a
cab
he
was
a
man
fairly
well
to
do
in
the
world
as
he
had
no
one
depending
on
him
but
one
daughter
no
one
that
is
to
say
whom
he
was
obliged
to
support
but
he
had
a
married
sister
with
a
scapegrace
husband
and
six
daughters
whom
in
fact
he
did
support
carroll
with
the
kindest
intentions
in
the
world
had
come
and
lived
near
him
she
had
taken
a
genteel
house
in
bolsover
terrace
a
genteel
new
house
on
the
fulham
road
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
her
brother
grey
lived
in
the
old
a
small
uncomfortable
place
which
had
a
nook
of
its
own
close
upon
the
water
and
with
a
lovely
little
lawn
it
was
certainly
most
uncomfortable
as
a
gentleman
residence
but
no
consideration
would
induce
grey
to
sell
it
there
were
but
two
in
it
and
one
was
for
the
most
part
uninhabited
the
was
furnished
but
any
one
with
half
an
eye
could
see
that
it
was
never
used
a
stray
caller
might
be
shown
up
there
but
callers
of
that
class
were
very
uncommon
in
establishment
with
his
own
domestic
arrangements
grey
would
have
been
quite
contented
had
it
not
been
for
carroll
it
was
now
some
years
since
he
had
declared
that
though
carroll
or
captain
carroll
as
he
had
then
been
called
was
an
improvident
worthless
drunken
irishman
he
would
never
see
his
sister
want
the
consequence
was
that
carroll
had
come
with
his
wife
and
six
daughters
and
taken
a
house
close
to
him
there
are
such
whips
and
scorns
in
the
world
to
which
a
man
shall
be
so
subject
as
to
have
the
whole
tenor
of
his
life
changed
by
them
the
hero
bears
them
heroically
making
no
complaints
to
those
around
him
the
common
man
shrinks
and
squeals
and
cringes
so
that
he
is
known
to
those
around
him
as
one
especially
persecuted
in
this
respect
grey
was
a
grand
hero
when
he
spoke
to
his
friends
of
carroll
his
friends
were
taught
to
believe
that
his
outside
arrangements
with
his
sister
were
perfectly
comfortable
no
doubt
there
did
creep
out
among
those
who
were
most
intimate
with
him
a
knowledge
that
carroll
for
the
captain
had
in
truth
never
been
more
than
a
lieutenant
and
had
now
long
since
sold
out
was
impecunious
and
a
trouble
rather
than
otherwise
but
i
doubt
whether
there
was
a
single
inhabitant
of
the
neighborhood
of
fulham
who
was
aware
that
carroll
and
the
miss
carrolls
cost
grey
on
an
average
above
six
hundred
a
year
there
was
one
in
grey
family
to
whom
he
was
so
attached
that
he
would
to
oblige
her
have
thrown
over
the
whole
carroll
family
but
of
this
that
one
person
would
not
hear
she
hated
the
whole
carroll
family
with
an
almost
unholy
hatred
of
which
she
herself
was
endeavoring
to
repent
daily
but
in
vain
she
could
not
do
other
than
hate
them
but
she
could
do
other
than
allow
her
father
to
withdraw
his
fostering
protection
for
this
one
person
was
grey
only
daughter
and
his
one
close
domestic
associate
miss
dorothy
grey
was
known
well
to
all
the
neighborhood
and
was
both
feared
and
revered
as
we
shall
have
much
to
do
with
her
in
the
telling
of
our
story
it
may
be
well
to
make
her
stand
plainly
before
the
reader
eyes
in
the
first
place
it
must
be
understood
that
she
was
motherless
brotherless
and
sisterless
she
had
been
grey
only
child
and
her
mother
had
been
dead
for
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
she
was
now
about
thirty
years
of
age
but
was
generally
regarded
as
ranging
somewhere
between
forty
and
fifty
if
she
is
nearer
fifty
than
forty
i
eat
my
old
shoes
said
a
lady
in
the
neighborhood
to
a
gentleman
known
her
these
twenty
years
and
she
not
altered
in
the
least
as
dolly
grey
had
been
only
ten
twenty
years
ago
the
lady
must
have
been
wrong
but
it
is
singular
how
a
person
memory
of
things
may
be
created
out
of
their
present
appearances
dorothy
herself
had
apparently
no
desire
to
set
right
this
erroneous
opinion
which
the
neighborhood
entertained
respecting
her
she
did
not
seem
to
care
whether
she
was
supposed
to
be
thirty
or
forty
or
fifty
of
youth
as
a
means
of
getting
lovers
she
entertained
a
profound
contempt
that
no
lover
would
ever
come
she
was
assured
and
would
not
at
all
have
known
what
to
do
with
one
had
he
come
the
only
man
for
whom
she
had
ever
felt
the
slightest
regard
was
her
father
for
some
women
about
she
did
entertain
a
passionless
affection
but
they
were
generally
the
poor
the
afflicted
or
the
aged
it
was
however
always
necessary
that
the
person
so
signalized
should
be
submissive
now
carroll
grey
sister
had
long
since
shown
that
she
was
not
submissive
enough
nor
were
the
girls
the
eldest
of
whom
was
a
pert
ugly
minx
now
about
eighteen
years
old
the
second
sister
who
was
seventeen
was
supposed
to
be
a
beauty
but
which
of
the
two
was
the
more
odious
in
the
eyes
of
their
cousin
it
would
be
impossible
to
say
miss
dorothy
grey
was
dolly
only
to
her
father
had
any
one
else
so
ventured
to
call
her
she
would
have
started
up
at
once
the
outraged
aged
female
of
fifty
even
her
aunt
who
was
trouble
enough
to
her
felt
that
it
could
not
be
so
her
uncle
tried
it
once
and
she
declined
to
come
into
his
presence
for
a
month
letting
it
be
fully
understood
that
she
had
been
insulted
and
yet
she
was
not
according
to
my
idea
by
any
means
an
young
woman
it
is
true
that
she
wore
spectacles
and
as
she
always
desired
to
have
her
eyes
about
with
her
she
never
put
them
off
when
out
of
bed
but
how
many
german
girls
do
the
like
and
are
not
accounted
for
that
reason
to
be
plain
she
was
tall
and
we
may
almost
say
robust
she
had
the
full
use
of
all
her
limbs
and
was
never
ashamed
of
using
them
i
think
she
was
wrong
when
she
would
be
seen
to
wheel
the
barrow
about
the
garden
and
that
her
hands
must
have
suffered
in
her
attempts
to
live
down
the
conventional
absurdities
of
the
world
it
is
true
that
she
did
wear
gloves
during
her
gardening
but
she
wore
them
only
in
obedience
to
her
father
request
she
had
bright
eyes
somewhat
far
apart
and
wholesome
regular
features
her
nose
was
large
and
her
mouth
was
large
but
they
were
singularly
intelligent
and
full
of
humor
when
she
was
pleased
in
conversation
as
to
her
hair
she
was
too
indifferent
to
enable
one
to
say
that
it
was
attractive
but
it
was
smoothed
twice
a
day
was
very
copious
and
always
very
clean
indeed
for
cleanliness
from
head
to
foot
she
was
a
model
she
is
very
clean
but
then
it
second
to
nothing
to
her
had
said
a
sarcastic
old
lady
who
had
meant
to
imply
that
miss
dorothy
grey
was
not
constant
at
church
but
the
sarcastic
old
lady
had
known
nothing
about
it
dorothy
grey
never
stayed
away
from
morning
church
unless
her
presence
was
desired
by
her
father
and
for
once
or
twice
that
she
might
do
so
she
would
take
her
father
with
her
three
or
four
times
against
the
grain
with
him
it
must
be
acknowledged
but
the
most
singular
attribute
of
the
lady
appearance
has
still
to
be
mentioned
she
always
wore
a
slouch
hat
which
from
motives
of
propriety
she
called
her
bonnet
which
gave
her
a
singular
appearance
as
though
it
had
been
put
on
to
thatch
her
entirely
from
the
weather
it
was
made
generally
of
black
straw
and
was
round
equal
at
all
points
of
the
circle
and
was
fastened
with
broad
brown
ribbons
it
was
supposed
in
the
neighborhood
to
be
completely
the
unimaginative
nature
of
fulham
did
not
allow
the
fulham
mind
to
gather
in
the
fact
that
at
the
same
time
she
might
possess
two
or
three
such
hats
but
they
were
undoubtedly
precisely
similar
and
she
would
wear
them
in
london
with
exactly
the
same
indifference
as
in
the
comparatively
rural
neighborhood
of
her
own
residence
she
would
in
truth
go
up
and
down
in
the
omnibus
and
would
do
so
alone
without
the
slightest
regard
to
the
opinion
of
any
of
her
neighbors
the
carroll
girls
would
laugh
at
her
behind
her
back
but
no
carroll
girl
had
been
seen
ever
to
smile
before
her
face
instigated
to
do
so
by
their
cousin
vagaries
but
i
have
not
yet
mentioned
that
attribute
of
miss
grey
which
is
perhaps
the
most
essential
in
her
character
it
is
necessary
at
any
rate
that
they
should
know
it
who
wish
to
understand
her
nature
when
it
had
once
been
brought
home
to
her
that
duty
required
her
to
do
this
thing
or
the
other
or
to
say
this
word
or
another
the
thing
would
be
done
or
the
word
said
let
the
result
be
what
it
might
even
to
the
displeasure
of
her
father
the
word
was
said
or
the
thing
was
done
such
a
one
was

returned
home
in

on
the
day
of

not
in
the
happiest
humor
though
he
had
got
the
best
of

in
the

still
the
meeting
which
had
been

had
annoyed
him
tyrrwhit
had
made
accusations

himself
personally
which
he
knew
to
be
false
but
which
having
been
covered
up
and
not
expressed
exactly
he
had

unable

refute

you
are

scoundrel
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
you
to
take
him
by
the
throat
you
of
course
are
not
a
thief
and
a
scoundrel
he
shall
say
to
you
but
shall
say
it
in
such
a
tone
of
voice
as
to
make
you
understand
that
he
conceives
you
to
be

all
know
the
parliamentary
mode
of
giving
an
opponent
the
lie
so
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
the
speaker
shall
interfere
tyrrwhit
had
treated
grey
in
the
same
fashion
and
as
grey
was
irritable
and
irascible
and
as
he
would
brood
over
things
of
which
it
was
quite
unnecessary
that
a
lawyer
should
take
any
cognizance
he
went
back
home
an
unhappy
man
indeed
the
whole
scarborough
affair
had
been
from
first
to
last
a
great
trouble
to
him
the
work
which
he
was
now
performing
could
not
he
imagined
be
put
into
his
bill
to
that
he
was
supremely
indifferent
but
his
younger
partner
thought
it
a
little
hard
that
all
the
other
work
of
the
firm
should
be
thrown
on
his
shoulders
during
the
period
which
naturally
would
have
been
his
holidays
and
he
did
make
his
feelings
intelligible
to
grey
grey
who
was
essentially
a
just
man
saw
that
his
partner
was
right
and
made
offers
but
he
would
not
accede
to
the
only
proposition
which
his
partner
made
let
him
go
and
look
for
a
lawyer
elsewhere
said
his
partner
they
both
of
them
knew
that
scarborough
had
been
thoroughly
dishonest
but
he
had
been
an
old
client
his
father
before
him
had
been
a
client
of
grey
father
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
grey
theory
to
treat
the
old
man
after
this
fashion
and
he
had
taken
intense
interest
in
the
matter
he
had
first
of
all
been
quite
sure
that
mountjoy
scarborough
was
the
heir
and
though
mountjoy
scarborough
was
not
at
all
to
his
taste
he
had
been
prepared
to
fight
for
him
he
had
now
assured
himself
after
most
laborious
inquiry
that
augustus
scarborough
was
the
heir
and
although
in
the
course
of
the
business
he
had
come
to
hate
the
cautious
augustus
twice
worse
than
the
gambling
spendthrift
mountjoy
still
in
the
cause
of
honesty
and
truth
and
justice
he
fought
for
augustus
against
the
world
at
large
and
against
the
band
of
creditors
till
the
world
at
large
and
the
band
of
creditors
began
to
think
that
he
was
leagued
with
augustus
so
as
to
be
one
of
those
who
would
make
large
sums
of
money
out
of
the
irregularity
of
the
affair
this
made
him
cross
and
put
him
into
a
very
bad
humor
as
he
went
back
to
fulham
one
thing
must
be
told
of
grey
which
was
very
much
to
his
discredit
and
which
if
generally
known
would
have
caused
his
clients
to
think
him
to
be
unfit
to
be
the
recipient
of
their
family
secrets
he
told
all
the
secrets
to
dolly
he
was
a
man
who
could
not
possibly
be
induced
to
leave
his
business
behind
him
at
his
office
it
made
the
chief
subject
of
conversation
when
he
was
at
home
he
would
even
call
dolly
into
his
bedroom
late
at
night
bringing
her
out
of
bed
for
the
occasion
to
discuss
with
her
some
point
of
legal
strategy
of
legal
but
still
honest
strategy
which
had
just
occurred
to
him
maybe
he
had
not
quite
seen
his
way
as
to
the
honesty
and
wanted
dolly
opinion
on
the
subject
dolly
would
come
in
in
her
and
sitting
on
his
bed
would
discuss
the
matter
with
him
as
advocate
against
the
devil
sometimes
she
would
be
convinced
more
frequently
she
would
hold
her
own
but
the
points
which
were
discussed
in
that
way
and
the
strength
of
argumentation
which
was
used
on
either
side
would
have
surprised
the
clients
and
the
partner
and
the
clerks
and
the
eloquent
barrister
who
was
occasionally
employed
to
support
this
side
or
the
other
the
eloquent
barrister
or
it
might
be
the
client
himself
startled
sometimes
at
the
amount
of
enthusiasm
which
grey
would
throw
into
his
argument
would
little
dream
that
the
very
words
had
come
from
the
young
lady
in
her
to
tell
the
truth
miss
grey
thoroughly
liked
these
discussions
whether
held
on
the
lawn
or
in
the
or
during
the
silent
hours
of
the
night
they
formed
indeed
the
very
salt
of
her
life
she
felt
herself
to
be
the
conscience
of
the
firm
her
father
was
the
reason
and
the
partner
in
her
own
phraseology
was
the
devil
for
it
must
be
understood
that
dolly
grey
had
a
spice
of
fun
about
her
of
which
her
father
had
the
full
advantage
she
would
not
have
called
her
father
partner
the
devil
to
any
other
ear
but
her
father
and
that
her
father
knew
understanding
also
the
spirit
in
which
the
sobriquet
had
been
applied
he
did
not
think
that
his
partner
was
worse
than
another
man
nor
did
he
think
that
his
daughter
so
thought
the
partner
whose
name
was
barry
was
a
man
of
average
honesty
who
would
occasionally
be
surprised
at
the
searching
justness
with
which
grey
would
look
into
a
matter
after
it
had
been
already
debated
for
a
day
or
two
in
the
office
but
barry
though
he
had
the
pleasure
of
miss
grey
acquaintance
had
no
idea
of
the
nature
of
the
duties
which
she
performed
in
the
firm
i
nearly
about
this
abominable
business
said
grey
as
he
went
upstairs
to
his
dressing
room
the
normal
hour
for
dinner
was
six
he
had
arrived
on
this
occasion
at
seven
and
had
paid
a
shilling
extra
to
the
cabman
to
drive
him
quick
the
man
having
a
lame
horse
had
come
very
slowly
fidgeting
grey
into
additional
temporary
discomfort
he
had
got
his
additional
shilling
and
grey
had
only
additional
discomfort
i
declare
i
think
he
is
the
wickedest
old
man
the
world
ever
produced
this
he
said
as
dolly
followed
him
upstairs
but
dolly
wiser
than
her
father
would
say
nothing
about
the
wicked
old
man
in
the
servants
hearing
in
five
minutes
grey
came
down
dressed
by
the
use
of
which
word
was
implied
the
fact
that
he
had
shaken
his
neckcloth
washed
his
hands
and
face
and
put
on
his
slippers
it
was
understood
in
the
household
that
though
six
was
the
hour
named
for
dinner
seven
was
a
much
more
probable
time
grey
pertinaciously
refused
to
have
it
changed
stare
super
vias
antiquas
he
had
stoutly
said
when
the
proposition
had
been
made
to
him
by
which
he
had
intended
to
imply
that
as
during
the
last
twenty
years
he
had
been
compelled
to
dine
at
six
instead
of
six
he
did
not
mean
to
be
driven
any
farther
in
the
same
direction
consequently
his
cook
was
compelled
to
prepare
his
dinner
in
such
a
manner
that
it
might
be
eaten
at
one
hour
or
the
other
as
chance
would
have
it
the
dinner
passed
without
much
conversation
other
than
incidental
to
grey
wants
and
comforts
his
daughter
knew
that
he
had
been
at
the
office
for
eight
hours
and
knew
also
that
he
was
not
a
young
man
every
kind
of
little
cosseting
was
therefore
applied
to
him
there
was
a
pheasant
for
dinner
and
it
was
essentially
necessary
in
opinion
that
he
should
have
first
the
wing
quite
hot
and
then
the
leg
also
hot
and
that
the
should
be
quite
hot
on
the
two
occasions
for
herself
if
she
had
had
an
old
crow
for
dinner
it
would
have
been
the
same
thing
tea
and
were
her
luxuries
and
her
tea
and
had
been
enjoyed
three
hours
ago
i
declare
i
think
that
after
all
the
leg
is
the
better
joint
of
the
two
then
why
do
you
have
the
two
legs
there
would
be
a
savor
of
greediness
in
that
though
i
know
that
the
leg
will
go
down
and
i
should
then
be
able
to
draw
the
comparison
i
like
to
have
them
both
and
i
like
always
to
be
able
to
assert
my
opinion
that
the
leg
is
the
better
joint
now
how
about
the
you
said
i
should
have
an
from
which
it
appeared
that
grey
was
not
superior
to
having
the
dinner
discussed
in
his
presence
at
the
the
came
and
was
apparently
enjoyed
a
large
portion
of
it
was
put
between
two
plates
that
for
grimes
suggested
grey
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
grimes
is
worthy
of
it
if
you
knew
what
it
was
to
be
left
without
a
shilling
of
your
husband
wages
you
think
yourself
worthy
when
the
conversation
about
the
pudding
was
over
grey
ate
his
cheese
and
then
sat
quite
still
in
his
over
the
fire
while
the
things
were
being
taken
away
i
declare
i
think
he
is
the
wickedest
man
the
world
has
ever
produced
said
grey
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
thus
showing
by
the
repetition
of
the
words
he
had
before
used
that
his
mind
had
been
intent
on
scarborough
rather
than
on
the
pheasant
why
do
you
have
done
with
them
that
all
very
well
but
you
would
have
done
with
them
if
you
had
known
them
all
your
life
i
would
spend
my
time
and
energies
in
any
rascal
said
dolly
with
vigor
you
do
know
what
you
do
and
a
man
is
to
be
left
in
the
lurch
altogether
because
he
a
rascal
would
you
have
a
murderer
hanged
without
some
one
to
stand
up
for
him
yes
i
would
said
dolly
thoughtlessly
and
he
might
have
been
a
murderer
after
all
or
not
legally
so
which
as
far
as
the
law
goes
is
the
same
thing
but
this
special
question
had
been
often
discussed
between
them
and
grey
and
dolly
did
not
intend
to
be
carried
away
by
it
on
the
present
occasion
i
know
all
about
that
she
said
but
this
is
a
case
of
life
and
death
the
old
man
is
only
anxious
to
save
his
property
and
throws
upon
you
all
the
burden
of
doing
it
he
never
agrees
with
you
as
to
anything
you
say
as
to
legal
points
he
does
but
he
keeps
you
always
in
hot
water
and
puts
forward
so
much
villany
that
i
would
have
nothing
farther
to
do
with
him
he
has
been
so
crafty
that
you
hardly
know
now
which
is
in
truth
the
heir
oh
yes
i
do
said
the
lawyer
i
know
very
well
and
am
very
sorry
that
it
should
be
so
and
i
can
not
but
feel
for
the
rascal
because
the
dishonest
effort
was
made
on
behalf
of
his
own
son
why
was
it
necessary
said
dolly
with
sparks
flying
from
her
eye
throughout
from
the
beginning
he
has
been
bad
why
was
the
woman
not
his
wife
ah
why
indeed
but
had
his
sin
consisted
only
in
that
i
should
not
have
dreamed
of
refusing
my
assistance
as
a
family
lawyer
all
that
would
have
gone
for
nothing
then
when
evil
creeps
in
said
dolly
sententiously
you
can
not
put
it
right
afterward
never
mind
about
that
we
shall
never
get
to
the
end
if
you
go
back
to
adam
and
eve
people
do
go
back
often
enough
bother
said
grey
finishing
his
second
and
last
glass
of
do
keep
yourself
in
some
degree
to
the
question
in
dispute
in
advising
an
attorney
of
as
to
how
he
is
to
treat
a
client
you
ca
do
any
good
by
going
back
to
adam
and
eve
augustus
is
the
heir
and
i
am
bound
to
protect
the
property
for
him
from
these
harpies
the
moment
the
breath
is
out
of
the
old
man
body
they
will
settle
down
upon
it
if
we
leave
them
an
inch
of
ground
on
which
to
stand
every
detail
of
his
marriage
must
be
made
as
clear
as
daylight
and
that
must
be
done
in
the
teeth
of
former
false
statements
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
harpies
are
the
honestest
lot
of
people
concerned
the
law
is
not
on
their
side
they
have
got
no
right
the
estate
as
a
fact
will
belong
to
augustus
the
moment
his
father
dies
scarborough
endeavored
to
do
what
he
could
for
him
whom
he
regarded
as
his
eldest
son
it
was
very
wicked
he
was
adding
a
second
and
a
worse
crime
to
the
first
he
was
flying
in
the
face
of
the
laws
of
his
country
but
he
was
successful
and
he
threw
dust
into
my
eyes
because
he
wanted
to
save
the
property
for
the
boy
and
he
endeavored
to
make
it
up
to
his
second
son
by
saving
for
him
a
second
property
he
was
not
selfish
and
i
can
not
but
feel
for
him
but
you
say
he
is
the
wickedest
man
the
world
ever
produced
because
he
boasts
of
it
all
and
can
not
be
got
in
any
way
to
repent
he
gives
me
my
instructions
as
though
from
first
to
last
he
had
been
a
highly
honorable
man
and
only
laughs
at
me
when
i
object
and
yet
he
must
know
that
he
may
die
any
day
he
only
wishes
to
have
this
matter
set
straight
so
that
he
may
die
i
could
forgive
him
altogether
if
he
would
but
once
say
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
he
done
but
he
has
completely
the
air
of
the
fine
old
head
of
a
family
who
thinks
he
is
to
be
put
into
marble
the
moment
the
breath
is
out
of
his
body
and
that
he
richly
deserves
the
marble
he
is
to
be
put
into
that
is
a
question
between
him
and
his
god
said
dolly
he
has
got
a
god
he
believes
only
in
his
own
reason
and
is
content
to
do
so
lying
there
on
the
very
brink
of
eternity
he
is
quite
content
with
himself
because
he
thinks
that
he
has
not
been
selfish
he
cares
nothing
that
he
has
robbed
every
one
all
round
he
has
no
reverence
for
property
and
the
laws
which
govern
it
he
was
born
only
with
the
and
he
has
determined
to
treat
it
as
though
the
had
belonged
to
him
it
is
his
utter
disregard
for
law
for
what
the
law
has
decided
which
makes
me
declare
him
to
have
been
the
wickedest
man
the
world
ever
produced
it
is
his
disregard
for
truth
which
makes
you
think
so
he
cares
nothing
for
truth
he
scorns
it
and
laughs
at
it
and
yet
about
the
little
things
of
the
world
he
expects
his
word
to
be
taken
as
certainly
as
that
of
any
other
gentleman
i
would
not
take
it
yes
you
would
and
would
be
right
too
if
he
would
say
he
pay
me
a
hundred
pounds
or
a
thousand
i
would
have
his
word
as
soon
as
any
other
man
bond
and
yet
he
has
utterly
got
the
better
of
me
and
made
me
believe
that
a
marriage
took
place
when
there
was
no
marriage
i
think
i
have
a
cup
of
tea
you
wo
go
to
sleep
papa
oh
yes
i
shall
when
i
been
so
troubled
as
that
i
must
have
a
cup
of
tea
grey
was
often
troubled
and
as
a
consequence
dolly
was
called
up
for
consultations
in
the
middle
of
the
night
at
about
one
there
came
the
knock
at
dolly
door
and
the
usual
invitation
would
she
come
into
her
father
room
for
a
few
minutes
then
her
father
trotted
back
to
his
bed
and
dolly
of
course
followed
him
as
soon
as
she
had
clothed
herself
decently
why
did
you
tell
me
i
thought
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
go
or
i
thought
rather
that
i
should
be
able
to
make
up
my
mind
not
to
go
but
it
is
possible
that
down
there
i
may
have
some
effect
for
good
what
does
he
want
of
you
there
is
a
long
question
about
raising
money
with
which
augustus
desires
to
buy
the
silence
of
the
creditors
could
he
get
the
money
asked
dolly
yes
i
think
he
could
the
property
at
present
is
altogether
unembarrassed
to
give
scarborough
his
due
he
has
never
put
his
name
to
a
scrap
of
paper
nor
has
he
had
occasion
to
do
so
the
tretton
pottery
people
want
more
land
or
rather
more
water
and
a
large
sum
of
money
will
be
forthcoming
but
he
does
see
the
necessity
of
giving
tyrrwhit
a
or
certainly
hart
he
would
send
them
away
howling
without
a
scruple
now
augustus
is
anxious
to
settle
with
them
for
some
reason
which
i
do
not
clearly
understand
but
he
wishes
to
do
so
without
any
interference
on
his
father
part
in
fact
he
and
his
father
have
very
different
ideas
as
to
the
property
the
squire
regards
it
as
his
but
augustus
thinks
that
any
day
may
make
it
his
own
in
fact
they
are
on
the
very
verge
of
quarrelling
then
after
a
long
debate
dolly
consented
that
her
father
should
go
down
to
tretton
and
act
if
possible
the
part
of
chapter
xviii
the
carroll
family
aunt
carroll
is
coming
to
dinner
said
dolly
the
next
day
with
a
serious
face
i
know
she
is
have
a
nice
dinner
for
her
i
do
think
she
ever
has
a
nice
dinner
at
home
and
the
three
eldest
girls
are
coming
three
you
asked
them
yourself
on
sunday
very
well
they
said
their
papa
would
be
away
on
business
it
was
understood
that
carroll
was
never
asked
to
the
business
there
is
a
club
he
belongs
to
where
he
dines
and
gets
drunk
once
a
month
it
the
only
thing
he
does
regularly
they
must
have
their
dinner
at
any
rate
said
grey
i
think
they
should
suffer
because
he
drinks
this
had
been
a
subject
much
discussed
between
them
but
on
the
present
occasion
miss
grey
would
not
renew
it
she
despatched
her
father
in
a
cab
the
cab
having
been
procured
because
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
quarter
of
an
hour
late
and
then
went
to
work
to
order
her
dinner
it
has
been
said
that
miss
grey
hated
the
carrolls
but
she
hated
the
daughters
worse
than
the
mother
and
of
all
the
people
she
hated
in
the
world
she
hated
amelia
carroll
the
worst
amelia
the
eldest
entertained
an
idea
that
she
was
more
of
a
personage
in
the
world
eyes
than
her
cousin
that
she
went
to
more
parties
which
certainly
was
true
if
she
went
to
any
that
she
wore
finer
clothes
which
was
also
true
and
that
she
had
a
lover
whereas
dolly
grey
as
she
called
her
cousin
behind
her
back
had
none
this
lover
had
something
to
do
with
horses
and
had
only
been
heard
of
had
never
been
seen
at
the
sophy
was
a
good
deal
hated
also
being
a
forward
flirting
tricky
girl
of
seventeen
who
had
just
left
the
school
at
which
uncle
john
had
paid
for
her
education
georgina
the
third
was
still
at
school
under
similar
circumstances
and
was
pardoned
her
egregious
noisiness
and
romping
propensities
under
the
score
of
youth
she
was
sixteen
and
was
possessed
of
terrible
vitality
i
am
sure
they
take
after
their
father
altogether
grey
had
once
said
when
the
three
left
the
together
at
six
punctually
they
came
dolly
heard
a
great
clatter
of
four
people
leaving
their
clogs
and
cloaks
in
the
hall
and
would
not
move
out
of
the
unused
in
which
for
the
moment
she
was
seated
betsey
had
to
prepare
the
and
would
have
been
sadly
discomfited
had
she
been
driven
to
do
it
in
the
presence
of
three
carroll
girls
for
it
must
be
understood
that
betsey
had
no
greater
respect
for
the
carroll
girls
than
her
mistress
well
aunt
carroll
how
does
the
world
use
you
very
badly
you
have
been
up
to
see
me
for
ten
days
i
have
counted
but
when
i
do
come
i
do
often
do
any
good
how
are
minna
and
brenda
and
potsey
poor
potsey
has
got
a
nasty
boil
under
her
arm
it
comes
from
eating
too
much
toffy
said
georgina
i
told
her
it
would
how
very
nasty
you
are
said
miss
carroll
do
leave
the
child
and
her
ailments
alone
poor
papa
is
very
well
either
said
sophy
who
was
supposed
to
be
her
father
pet
i
hope
his
state
of
health
will
not
debar
him
from
dining
with
his
friends
said
miss
grey
you
have
always
something
to
say
about
papa
said
sophy
nothing
will
ever
keep
him
back
when
conviviality
demands
his
presence
this
came
from
his
afflicted
wife
who
in
spite
of
all
his
misfortunes
would
ever
speak
with
some
respect
of
her
employments
he
was
at
all
in
a
fit
state
to
go
but
he
had
promised
and
that
was
enough
when
they
had
waited
of
an
hour
amelia
began
to
complain
certainly
not
without
reason
i
wonder
why
uncle
john
always
keeps
us
waiting
in
this
way
papa
has
unfortunately
something
to
do
with
his
time
which
is
not
altogether
his
own
there
was
not
much
in
these
words
but
the
tone
in
which
they
were
uttered
would
have
crushed
any
one
more
susceptible
than
amelia
carroll
but
at
that
moment
the
cab
arrived
and
dolly
went
down
to
meet
her
father
have
they
come
he
asked
come
she
answered
taking
his
gloves
and
comforter
from
him
and
giving
him
a
kiss
as
she
did
so
that
girl
is
nearly
famished
i
wo
be
half
a
moment
said
the
repentant
father
hastening
to
go
through
his
ordinary
dressing
arrangement
i
would
hurry
for
her
said
dolly
but
of
course
you
hurry
you
always
do
do
you
papa
then
they
sat
down
to
dinner
well
girls
what
is
your
news
we
were
out
on
the
brompton
road
said
the
eldest
and
there
came
up
prince
chitakov
drag
with
four
roans
prince
chitakov
i
did
know
there
was
such
a
prince
oh
dear
yes
with
very
stiff
mustaches
turned
up
high
at
the
corners
and
pink
cheeks
and
a
very
sharp
hat
with
a
grey
coat
and
light
gloves
you
must
know
the
prince
upon
my
word
i
never
heard
of
him
my
dear
what
did
the
prince
do
he
was
tooling
his
own
drag
and
he
had
a
lady
with
him
on
the
box
i
never
saw
anything
more
tasty
than
her
dress
dark
red
silk
with
little
fluffy
fur
ornaments
all
over
it
i
wonder
who
she
was
chitakov
probably
said
the
attorney
i
do
think
the
prince
is
a
married
man
said
sophy
they
never
are
for
the
most
part
said
amelia
and
she
would
be
chitakov
uncle
john
would
she
now
what
would
she
be
can
either
of
you
tell
me
what
the
wife
of
a
prince
of
chitakov
would
call
herself
princess
of
chitakov
of
course
said
sophy
it
the
princess
of
wales
but
it
is
the
princess
of
christian
nor
yet
the
princess
of
teck
nor
the
princess
of
england
i
do
see
why
the
lady
should
be
chitakov
if
there
is
such
a
lady
papa
do
bamboozle
her
said
his
daughter
but
continued
the
attorney
why
should
the
lady
have
been
his
wife
do
married
ladies
wear
little
fluffy
fur
ornaments
i
wish
john
you
would
talk
to
the
girls
in
that
strain
said
their
mother
it
really
is
becoming
to
suggest
that
the
lady
was
the
gentleman
wife
but
i
was
going
to
say
continued
amelia
that
as
the
prince
drove
by
he
kissed
his
hand
he
did
indeed
and
sophy
and
i
were
walking
along
as
demurely
as
possible
i
never
was
so
knocked
of
a
heap
in
all
my
life
he
did
said
sophy
it
the
most
impertinent
thing
i
ever
heard
if
my
father
had
seen
it
he
have
had
the
prince
off
the
box
of
the
coach
in
no
time
then
my
dear
said
the
attorney
i
am
very
glad
that
your
father
did
not
see
it
poor
dolly
during
this
conversation
about
the
prince
sat
angry
and
silent
thinking
to
herself
in
despair
of
what
extremes
of
vulgarity
even
a
first
cousin
of
her
own
could
be
guilty
that
she
should
be
sitting
at
table
with
a
girl
who
could
boast
that
a
reprobate
foreigner
had
kissed
his
hand
to
her
from
the
box
of
a
fashionable
coach
for
it
was
in
that
light
that
miss
grey
regarded
it
and
did
you
have
any
farther
adventures
besides
this
memorable
encounter
with
the
prince
nothing
nearly
so
interesting
said
sophy
that
was
hardly
to
be
expected
said
the
attorney
jane
you
will
have
a
glass
of
girls
you
must
have
a
glass
of
to
support
you
after
your
disappointment
with
the
prince
we
were
not
disappointed
in
the
least
said
amelia
pray
pray
let
the
subject
drop
said
dolly
that
is
because
the
prince
did
not
kiss
his
hand
to
you
said
sophy
then
miss
grey
sunk
again
into
silence
crushed
beneath
this
last
blow
in
the
evening
when
the
had
been
taken
away
a
matter
of
business
came
up
and
took
the
place
of
the
prince
and
his
mustaches
carroll
was
most
anxious
to
know
whether
her
brother
could
lend
her
a
small
sum
of
twenty
pounds
it
came
out
in
conversation
that
the
small
sum
was
needed
to
satisfy
some
imperious
demand
made
upon
carroll
by
a
tailor
he
must
have
clothes
you
know
said
the
poor
woman
wailing
he
does
have
many
but
he
must
have
some
there
had
been
other
appeals
on
the
same
subject
made
not
very
long
since
and
to
tell
the
truth
grey
did
require
to
have
the
subject
argued
in
fear
of
the
subsequent
remarks
which
would
be
made
to
him
afterward
by
his
daughter
if
he
gave
the
money
too
easily
the
loan
had
to
be
arranged
in
full
conclave
as
otherwise
carroll
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
obtain
access
to
her
brother
ear
but
the
one
auditor
whom
she
feared
was
her
niece
on
the
present
occasion
miss
grey
simply
took
up
her
book
to
show
that
the
subject
was
one
which
had
no
interest
for
her
but
she
did
undoubtedly
listen
to
all
that
was
said
on
the
subject
there
was
never
anything
settled
about
poor
patrick
clothes
said
carroll
in
a
she
did
not
care
how
much
her
own
children
heard
and
she
knew
how
vain
it
was
to
attempt
so
to
speak
that
dolly
should
not
hear
i
dare
say
something
ought
to
be
done
at
some
time
said
grey
who
knew
that
he
would
be
told
when
the
evening
was
over
that
he
would
give
away
all
his
substance
to
that
man
if
he
were
asked
papa
has
not
had
a
new
pair
of
trousers
this
year
said
sophy
except
those
green
ones
he
wore
at
the
races
said
georgina
hold
your
tongue
miss
said
her
mother
that
was
a
pair
i
made
up
for
him
and
sent
them
to
the
man
to
get
pressed
when
the
hundred
a
year
was
arranged
for
all
our
dresses
said
amelia
not
a
word
was
said
about
papa
of
course
papa
is
a
trouble
i
do
see
that
he
is
more
of
a
trouble
than
any
one
else
said
sophy
uncle
john
would
not
like
not
to
have
any
clothes
no
i
should
not
my
dear
and
his
own
income
is
all
given
up
to
the
house
uses
here
sophy
touched
imprudently
on
a
sore
subject
his
own
income
consisted
of
what
had
been
saved
out
of
his
wife
fortune
and
was
thus
named
as
in
opposition
to
the
larger
sum
paid
to
carroll
by
grey
there
was
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
coming
from
settled
property
which
had
been
preserved
by
the
lawyer
care
and
which
was
regarded
in
the
family
as
papa
own
it
certainly
is
essential
for
respectability
that
something
should
be
set
apart
from
a
man
income
for
his
wearing
apparel
and
though
the
money
was
perhaps
improperly
so
designated
dolly
would
not
have
objected
had
she
not
thought
that
it
had
already
gone
to
the
in
company
with
the
green
trousers
she
had
her
own
means
of
obtaining
information
as
to
the
carroll
family
it
was
very
necessary
that
she
should
do
so
if
the
family
was
to
be
kept
on
its
legs
at
all
i
do
think
any
good
can
come
from
discussing
what
my
uncle
does
with
the
money
this
was
dolly
first
speech
if
he
is
to
have
it
let
him
have
it
but
let
him
have
as
little
as
possible
i
never
heard
anybody
so
cross
as
you
always
are
to
papa
said
sophy
your
cousin
dorothy
is
very
fortunate
said
carroll
she
does
not
know
what
it
is
to
want
for
anything
she
never
spends
anything
on
herself
said
her
father
it
is
only
fault
that
she
wo
because
she
has
it
all
done
for
her
said
amelia
dolly
had
gone
back
to
her
book
and
disdained
to
make
any
farther
reply
her
father
felt
that
quite
enough
had
been
said
about
it
and
was
prepared
to
give
the
twenty
pounds
under
the
idea
that
he
might
be
thought
to
have
made
a
stout
fight
upon
the
subject
he
does
want
them
very
badly
for
decency
sake
said
the
poor
wife
thus
winding
up
her
plea
then
grey
got
out
his
and
wrote
the
check
for
twenty
pounds
but
he
made
it
payable
not
to
but
to
carroll
i
suppose
papa
nothing
can
be
done
about
mr
carroll
this
was
said
by
dolly
as
soon
as
the
family
had
withdrawn
in
what
way
my
dear
as
to
settling
some
farther
sum
for
himself
he
only
spend
it
my
dear
that
would
be
intended
said
dolly
and
then
he
would
come
back
just
the
same
but
in
that
case
he
should
have
nothing
more
though
they
were
to
declare
that
he
had
a
pair
of
trousers
in
which
to
appear
at
a
he
should
have
it
my
dear
said
grey
you
can
not
get
rid
of
the
gnats
of
the
world
they
will
buzz
and
sting
and
be
a
nuisance
poor
jane
suffers
worse
from
this
gnat
than
you
or
i
put
up
with
it
and
understand
in
your
own
mind
that
when
he
comes
for
another
twenty
pounds
he
must
have
it
you
need
tell
him
but
so
it
must
be
if
i
had
my
way
said
dolly
after
ten
minutes
silence
i
would
punish
him
he
is
an
evil
thing
and
should
be
made
to
reap
the
proper
reward
it
is
not
that
i
wish
to
avoid
my
share
of
the
world
burdens
but
that
justice
should
be
done
i
do
know
which
i
hate
the
worst
uncle
carroll
or
mr
scarborough
the
next
day
was
sunday
and
dolly
was
very
anxious
before
breakfast
to
induce
her
father
to
say
that
he
would
go
to
church
with
her
but
he
was
inclined
to
be
obstinate
and
fell
back
upon
his
usual
excuse
saying
that
there
were
scarborough
papers
which
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
read
before
he
started
for
tretton
on
the
following
day
papa
i
think
it
would
do
you
good
if
you
came
well
yes
i
suppose
it
would
that
is
the
intention
but
somehow
it
fails
with
me
sometimes
do
you
think
that
you
hate
people
when
you
go
to
church
as
much
as
when
you
do
i
am
not
sure
that
i
hate
anybody
very
much
i
do
that
seems
an
argument
for
your
going
but
if
you
do
hate
them
it
is
because
you
wo
take
the
trouble
and
that
again
is
not
right
if
you
would
come
to
church
you
would
be
better
for
it
all
round
you
hate
uncle
carroll
idleness
and
abominable
worse
than
you
do
i
do
love
him
as
it
is
my
dear
and
i
should
hate
him
less
i
felt
last
night
as
though
i
could
rise
from
my
bed
and
go
and
murder
him
then
you
certainly
ought
to
go
to
church
and
you
had
passed
him
off
just
as
though
he
were
a
gnat
from
which
you
were
to
receive
as
little
annoyance
as
possible
forgetting
the
influence
he
must
have
on
those
six
unfortunate
children
do
you
know
that
you
gave
her
that
twenty
pounds
simply
to
be
rid
of
a
disagreeable
subject
i
should
have
given
it
ever
so
much
sooner
only
that
you
were
looking
at
me
i
know
you
would
you
dear
sweet
but
most
father
you
must
come
to
church
in
order
that
some
idea
of
what
christianity
demands
of
you
may
make
its
way
into
your
heart
it
is
not
what
the
clergyman
may
say
of
you
but
that
your
mind
will
get
away
for
two
hours
from
that
other
reptile
and
his
concerns
then
grey
with
a
loud
long
sigh
allowed
his
boots
and
his
gloves
and
his
hat
and
his
umbrella
to
be
brought
to
him
it
was
in
fact
his
aversion
to
these
articles
that
dolly
had
to
encounter
it
may
be
doubted
whether
the
church
services
of
that
day
did
grey
much
good
but
they
seemed
to
have
had
some
effect
upon
his
daughter
from
the
fact
that
in
the
afternoon
she
wrote
a
letter
in
kindly
words
to
her
aunt
papa
is
going
to
tretton
and
i
will
come
up
to
you
on
tuesday
i
have
got
a
frock
which
i
will
bring
with
me
as
a
present
for
potsey
and
i
will
make
her
sew
on
the
buttons
for
herself
tell
minna
i
will
lend
her
that
book
i
spoke
of
about
those
boots
i
will
go
with
georgina
to
the
but
as
to
amelia
and
sophy
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
say
a
word
so
deep
in
her
heart
had
sunk
that
sin
of
which
they
had
been
guilty
with
reference
to
prince
chitakov
on
that
night
she
had
a
long
discussion
with
her
father
respecting
the
affairs
of
the
scarborough
family
the
discussion
was
held
in
the
and
may
therefore
be
supposed
to
have
been
premeditated
those
at
night
in
grey
own
bedroom
were
generally
the
result
of
sudden
thought
i
should
lay
down
the
law
to
him
began
dolly
the
law
is
the
law
said
her
father
i
do
mean
the
law
in
that
sense
i
should
tell
him
firmly
what
i
advised
and
should
then
make
him
understand
that
if
he
did
not
follow
my
advice
i
must
withdraw
if
his
son
is
willing
to
pay
these
what
sums
they
have
actually
advanced
and
if
by
any
effort
on
his
part
the
money
can
be
raised
let
it
be
done
there
seems
to
be
some
justice
in
repaying
out
of
the
property
that
which
was
lent
to
the
property
when
by
scarborough
own
doing
the
property
was
supposed
to
go
into
the
eldest
son
hands
though
the
eldest
son
and
the
be
spendthrifts
and
profligates
alike
there
will
in
that
be
something
of
fairness
go
there
prepared
with
your
opinion
but
if
either
father
or
son
will
not
accept
it
then
depart
and
shake
the
dust
from
your
feet
you
propose
it
all
as
though
it
were
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
easy
or
difficult
i
would
not
discuss
anything
of
which
the
justice
may
hereafter
be
disputed
what
was
the
result
of
the
consultation
on
grey
mind
he
did
not
declare
but
he
resolved
to
take
his
daughter
advice
in
all
that
she
said
to
him
chapter
xix
grey
goes
to
tretton
grey
went
down
to
tretton
with
a
great
bag
of
papers
in
fact
though
he
told
his
daughter
that
he
had
to
examine
them
all
before
he
started
and
had
taken
them
to
fulham
for
that
purpose
he
had
not
looked
at
them
and
as
another
fact
the
bag
was
not
opened
till
he
got
home
again
they
had
been
read
at
any
rate
what
was
necessary
he
knew
his
subject
the
old
squire
knew
it
well
grey
was
going
down
to
tretton
not
to
convey
facts
or
to
explain
the
law
but
in
order
that
he
might
take
the
side
either
of
the
father
or
of
the
son
scarborough
had
sent
for
the
lawyer
to
support
his
view
of
the
case
and
the
son
had
consented
to
meet
him
in
order
that
he
might
the
more
easily
get
the
better
of
his
father
grey
had
of
late
learned
one
thing
which
had
before
been
dark
to
him
had
seen
one
phase
of
this
complicated
farrago
of
dishonesty
which
had
not
before
been
visible
to
him
augustus
suspected
his
father
of
some
farther
treachery
that
he
should
be
angry
at
having
been
debarred
from
his
birthright
so
long
debarred
from
the
knowledge
of
his
birthright
was
grey
thought
natural
a
great
wrong
had
been
at
least
intended
and
that
such
a
man
should
resent
it
was
to
have
been
expected
but
of
late
grey
had
discovered
that
it
was
not
in
that
way
that
the
son
mind
worked
it
was
not
anger
but
suspicion
that
he
showed
and
he
used
his
father
former
treatment
of
him
as
a
justification
for
the
condemnation
implied
in
his
thoughts
there
is
no
knowing
what
an
old
man
may
do
who
has
already
acted
as
he
had
done
it
was
thus
that
he
expressed
himself
both
by
his
words
and
deeds
and
did
so
openly
in
his
father
presence
grey
had
not
seen
them
together
but
knew
from
the
letters
of
both
of
them
that
such
was
the
case
old
scarborough
scorned
his
son
suspicions
and
disregarded
altogether
any
words
that
might
be
said
as
to
his
own
past
conduct
he
was
willing
or
half
willing
that
mountjoy
debts
should
be
not
paid
but
settled
but
he
was
willing
to
do
nothing
toward
such
a
step
except
in
his
own
way
while
the
breath
was
in
his
body
the
property
was
his
and
he
chose
to
be
treated
as
its
only
master
if
augustus
desired
to
do
anything
by
let
him
ruin
himself
after
his
own
fashion
it
is
not
very
likely
that
augustus
can
raise
money
by
post
obits
circumstanced
as
the
property
is
he
had
written
to
grey
with
a
conveyed
sneer
and
chuckle
as
to
the
success
of
his
own
villany
it
was
as
though
he
had
declared
that
the
had
been
too
well
instructed
as
to
what
tricks
scarborough
could
play
with
his
property
to
risk
a
second
venture
augustus
had
in
truth
been
awaiting
his
father
death
with
great
impatience
it
was
unreasonable
that
a
man
should
live
who
had
acted
in
such
a
way
and
who
had
been
so
cut
about
by
the
doctors
his
demise
had
in
truth
been
promised
to
him
and
to
all
the
world
it
was
an
understood
thing
in
all
circles
which
knew
anything
that
old
scarborough
could
not
live
another
month
it
had
been
understood
some
time
and
was
understood
at
the
present
moment
and
yet
scarborough
went
on
living
no
doubt
as
an
invalid
in
the
last
stage
of
probable
dissolution
but
still
with
the
full
command
of
his
intellect
and
mental
powers
for
mischief
augustus
suspecting
him
as
he
did
had
begun
to
fear
that
he
might
live
too
long
his
brother
had
disappeared
and
he
was
the
heir
if
his
father
would
die
such
had
been
his
first
thought
he
could
settle
with
the
creditors
immediately
before
any
tidings
should
be
heard
of
his
brother
but
tidings
had
come
his
brother
had
been
seen
by
hart
at
monte
carlo
and
though
hart
had
not
yet
sent
home
the
news
to
the
other
creditors
the
news
had
been
sent
at
once
to
augustus
scarborough
by
his
own
paid
attendant
upon
his
brother
of
hart
little
game
he
did
not
yet
know
the
particulars
but
he
was
confident
that
there
was
some
game
augustus
by
no
means
gave
his
mother
credit
for
the
disgraceful
conduct
imputed
to
her
in
the
story
as
now
told
by
her
surviving
husband
it
was
not
that
he
believed
in
the
honesty
of
his
mother
whom
he
had
never
known
and
for
whose
memory
he
cared
little
but
that
he
believed
so
fully
in
the
dishonesty
of
his
father
his
father
when
he
had
thoroughly
understood
that
mountjoy
had
enveloped
the
property
in
debt
so
that
nothing
but
a
skeleton
would
remain
when
the
bonds
were
paid
had
set
to
work
and
by
the
ingenuity
of
his
brain
had
resolved
to
redeem
as
far
as
the
scarboroughs
were
concerned
their
estate
from
its
unfortunate
position
it
was
so
that
augustus
believed
this
was
the
theory
existing
in
his
mind
that
his
father
should
have
been
so
clever
and
grey
so
blind
and
even
hart
and
tyrrwhit
so
easily
hoodwinked
was
remarkable
but
so
it
was
or
might
probably
be
so
he
felt
no
assurance
but
there
was
ever
present
to
him
the
feeling
of
great
danger
but
the
state
of
things
as
arranged
by
his
father
might
be
established
by
himself
if
he
could
get
these
creditors
to
give
up
their
bonds
while
his
falsehood
was
still
believed
it
would
be
a
great
thing
he
had
learned
by
degrees
how
small
a
proportion
of
the
money
claimed
had
in
fact
been
advanced
to
mountjoy
and
had
resolved
to
confine
himself
to
paying
that
that
might
now
probably
be
accepted
with
gratitude
the
increasing
value
of
the
estate
might
bear
that
without
being
crushed
but
it
should
be
done
at
once
while
mountjoy
was
still
absent
and
before
tyrrwhit
at
any
rate
knew
that
mountjoy
had
not
been
killed
then
had
happened
that
accidental
meeting
with
hart
at
monte
carlo
that
idiot
of
a
keeper
of
his
had
been
unable
to
keep
mountjoy
from
the
but
hart
had
as
yet
told
nothing
hart
was
playing
some
game
of
his
own
in
which
he
would
assuredly
be
foiled
the
strong
hold
which
augustus
had
was
in
the
great
infirmity
of
his
father
and
in
the
blindness
of
grey
but
it
would
be
settled
it
ought
to
have
been
well
that
the
thing
should
be
settled
already
by
his
father
death
augustus
did
feel
strongly
that
the
squire
ought
to
complete
his
work
by
dying
were
the
story
as
now
told
by
him
true
he
ought
certainly
to
die
so
as
to
make
speedy
atonement
for
his
wickedness
were
it
false
then
he
ought
to
go
quickly
so
that
the
lie
might
be
effectual
every
day
that
he
continued
to
live
would
go
far
to
endanger
the
discovery
augustus
felt
that
he
must
at
once
have
the
property
in
his
own
hands
so
as
to
buy
the
creditors
and
obtain
security
grey
who
was
not
so
blind
as
augustus
thought
him
saw
a
great
deal
of
this
augustus
suspected
him
as
well
as
the
squire
his
mind
went
backward
and
forward
on
these
suspicions
it
was
more
probable
that
the
squire
should
have
contrived
all
this
with
the
attorney
assistance
than
without
it
the
two
willing
it
together
might
be
very
powerful
but
then
grey
would
hardly
dare
to
do
it
his
father
knew
that
he
was
dying
but
grey
had
no
such
easy
mode
of
immediate
escape
if
detected
and
his
father
was
endowed
with
a
courage
as
peculiar
as
it
was
great
he
did
not
think
that
grey
was
so
brave
a
man
as
his
father
and
then
he
could
trace
the
payment
of
no
large
sum
to
grey
such
as
would
have
been
necessary
as
a
bribe
in
such
a
case
augustus
suspected
grey
on
and
off
but
grey
was
sure
that
augustus
suspected
his
own
father
now
of
one
thing
grey
was
certain
augustus
was
in
truth
the
rightful
heir
the
squire
had
at
first
contrived
to
blind
him
him
grey
partly
by
his
own
acuteness
partly
through
the
carelessness
of
himself
and
those
in
his
office
partly
by
the
subornation
of
witnesses
who
seemed
to
have
been
actually
prepared
for
such
an
event
but
there
could
be
no
subsequent
blinding
grey
had
a
reputation
for
professional
acuteness
and
honesty
he
knew
there
was
no
need
for
such
suspicions
as
those
now
entertained
by
the
young
man
but
he
knew
also
that
they
existed
and
he
hated
the
young
man
for
entertaining
them
when
he
arrived
at
tretton
park
he
first
of
all
saw
septimus
jones
with
whom
he
was
not
acquainted
scarborough
will
be
here
directly
he
is
out
somewhere
about
the
stables
said
jones
in
that
tone
of
voice
with
which
a
guest
at
the
house
a
guest
for
pleasure
may
address
sometimes
a
guest
who
is
a
guest
on
business
in
such
a
case
the
guest
on
pleasure
can
not
be
a
gentleman
and
must
suppose
that
the
guest
on
business
is
not
one
either
grey
thinking
that
the
scarborough
spoken
of
could
not
be
the
squire
put
jones
right
it
is
the
elder
scarborough
whom
i
wish
to
see
there
is
quite
time
enough
no
doubt
miss
scarborough
will
be
down
presently
you
are
grey
i
believe
that
is
my
name
my
friend
augustus
scarborough
is
particularly
anxious
to
see
you
before
you
go
to
his
father
the
old
man
is
in
very
failing
health
you
know
i
am
well
acquainted
with
the
state
of
scarborough
health
said
grey
and
will
leave
it
to
himself
to
say
when
i
shall
see
him
perhaps
will
be
best
then
he
rung
the
bell
but
the
servant
entered
the
room
at
the
same
moment
and
summoned
him
up
to
the
chamber
scarborough
also
wished
to
see
grey
before
his
son
and
had
been
on
the
alert
to
watch
for
his
coming
on
the
landing
he
met
miss
scarborough
he
does
seem
to
keep
up
his
strength
said
the
lady
merton
is
living
in
the
house
now
and
watches
him
very
closely
merton
was
a
resident
young
doctor
whom
sir
william
brodrick
had
sent
down
to
see
that
all
medical
appliances
were
at
hand
as
the
sick
man
might
require
them
then
grey
was
shown
in
and
found
the
squire
recumbent
on
a
sofa
with
a
store
of
books
within
his
reach
and
reading
apparatuses
of
all
descriptions
and
every
appliance
which
the
ingenuity
of
the
skilful
can
prepare
for
the
relief
of
the
sick
and
wealthy
this
is
very
kind
of
you
grey
said
the
squire
speaking
in
a
cheery
voice
i
wanted
you
to
come
very
much
but
i
hardly
thought
that
you
would
take
the
trouble
augustus
is
here
you
know
so
i
have
heard
from
that
gentleman
jones
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
jones
what
sort
of
a
gentleman
is
jones
to
look
at
very
much
like
other
gentlemen
i
dare
say
he
has
done
me
the
honor
to
stay
a
good
deal
at
my
house
lately
augustus
never
comes
without
him
he
is
achates
i
take
it
to
augustus
augustus
has
never
asked
whether
he
can
be
received
of
course
it
does
not
matter
when
a
man
is
the
eldest
son
and
so
to
say
the
only
one
he
is
apt
to
take
liberties
with
his
father
house
i
am
so
sorry
that
in
my
position
i
can
not
do
the
honors
and
receive
him
properly
he
is
a
very
estimable
and
modest
young
man
i
believe
as
grey
had
not
come
down
to
tretton
either
to
be
a
spy
on
jones
or
to
answer
questions
concerning
him
he
held
his
tongue
well
grey
what
do
you
think
about
it
eh
this
was
a
comprehensive
question
but
grey
well
understood
its
purport
what
did
he
grey
think
of
the
condition
to
which
the
affairs
of
tretton
had
been
brought
and
those
of
scarborough
himself
and
of
his
two
sons
what
did
he
think
of
mountjoy
who
had
disappeared
and
was
still
absent
what
did
he
think
of
augustus
who
was
not
showing
his
gratitude
in
the
best
way
for
all
that
had
been
done
for
him
and
what
did
he
think
of
the
squire
himself
who
from
his
had
so
well
contrived
to
have
his
own
way
in
everything
to
do
all
manner
of
illegal
things
without
paying
any
of
the
penalties
to
which
illegality
is
generally
subject
and
having
asked
the
question
he
paused
for
an
answer
grey
had
had
no
personal
interview
with
the
squire
since
the
time
at
which
it
had
been
declared
that
mountjoy
was
not
the
heir
then
some
very
severe
words
had
been
spoken
grey
had
first
sworn
that
he
did
not
believe
a
word
of
what
was
said
to
him
and
had
refused
to
deal
with
the
matter
at
all
if
carried
out
scarborough
must
take
it
to
some
other
lawyer
office
there
had
since
that
been
a
correspondence
as
to
much
of
which
scarborough
had
been
forced
to
employ
an
amanuensis
gradually
grey
had
assented
in
the
first
instance
on
behalf
of
mountjoy
and
then
on
behalf
of
augustus
but
he
had
done
so
in
the
expectation
that
he
should
never
again
see
the
squire
in
this
world
he
too
had
been
assured
that
the
man
would
die
and
had
felt
that
it
would
be
better
that
the
management
of
things
should
then
be
in
honest
hands
such
as
his
own
and
in
the
hands
of
those
who
understood
them
than
be
confided
to
those
who
did
not
not
understand
them
and
who
might
probably
not
be
honest
but
the
squire
had
not
died
and
here
he
was
again
at
tretton
as
the
squire
guest
i
think
said
grey
that
the
less
said
about
a
good
deal
of
it
the
better
that
of
course
is
sweeping
condemnation
which
however
i
expect
let
that
be
all
as
though
it
had
been
expressed
you
do
understand
the
inner
man
which
rules
me
how
it
has
struggled
to
free
itself
from
conventionalities
nor
do
i
quite
understand
how
your
inner
man
has
succumbed
to
them
and
encouraged
them
i
have
encouraged
an
obedience
to
the
laws
of
my
country
men
generally
find
it
safer
to
do
so
exactly
and
men
like
to
be
safe
perhaps
a
condition
of
danger
has
had
its
attractions
for
me
it
is
very
stupid
but
perhaps
it
is
so
but
let
that
go
the
rope
has
been
round
my
own
neck
and
not
round
that
of
others
perhaps
i
have
thought
of
late
that
if
danger
should
come
i
could
run
away
from
it
all
by
the
help
of
the
surgeon
they
have
become
so
skilful
now
that
a
man
has
no
chance
in
that
way
but
what
do
you
think
of
mountjoy
and
augustus
i
think
that
mountjoy
has
been
very
but
i
endeavored
to
do
the
best
i
could
for
him
and
that
augustus
has
been
worse
used
but
he
at
any
rate
has
been
put
right
quite
in
time
had
he
been
brought
up
as
the
eldest
son
he
might
have
done
as
mountjoy
did
then
there
came
a
little
gleam
of
satisfaction
across
the
squire
face
as
he
felt
the
sufficiency
of
his
answer
but
they
are
neither
of
them
pleased
you
can
not
please
men
by
going
wrong
even
in
their
own
behalf
i
not
so
sure
of
that
were
you
to
say
that
we
can
not
please
men
ever
by
doing
right
on
their
behalf
you
would
perhaps
be
nearer
the
mark
where
do
you
think
that
mountjoy
is
a
rumor
had
reached
grey
that
mountjoy
had
been
seen
at
monte
carlo
but
it
had
been
only
a
rumor
the
same
had
in
truth
reached
scarborough
but
he
chose
to
keep
his
rumor
to
himself
indeed
more
than
a
rumor
had
reached
him
i
think
that
he
will
turn
up
safely
said
the
lawyer
i
think
that
if
it
were
made
worth
his
while
he
would
turn
up
at
once
is
it
not
better
that
he
should
be
away
grey
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
the
good
of
his
coming
back
into
a
nest
of
hornets
i
have
always
thought
that
he
did
very
well
to
disappear
where
is
he
to
live
if
he
came
back
should
he
come
here
not
with
his
gambling
debts
unpaid
at
the
club
that
might
have
been
settled
though
indeed
his
gambling
was
as
a
tub
that
has
no
bottom
to
it
there
has
been
nothing
for
it
but
to
throw
him
over
altogether
and
yet
how
very
much
the
better
he
has
been
of
the
two
poor
mountjoy
poor
mountjoy
you
see
if
i
had
disinherited
him
i
should
have
had
to
go
on
paying
for
him
till
the
whole
estate
would
have
been
squandered
even
during
my
lifetime
you
speak
as
though
the
law
had
given
you
the
power
of
disinheriting
him
so
it
did
but
not
the
power
of
giving
him
the
inheritance
i
took
that
upon
myself
there
i
was
stronger
than
the
law
now
i
simply
and
humbly
ask
the
law
to
come
and
help
me
and
the
upshot
is
that
augustus
takes
upon
himself
to
lecture
me
and
to
feel
aggrieved
he
is
not
angry
with
me
for
what
i
did
about
mountjoy
but
is
quarrelling
with
me
because
i
do
not
die
i
have
no
idea
of
dying
just
to
please
him
i
think
it
important
that
i
should
live
just
at
present
but
will
you
let
him
have
the
money
to
pay
these
creditors
that
is
what
i
want
to
speak
about
if
i
can
see
the
list
of
the
sums
to
be
paid
and
if
you
can
assure
yourself
that
by
paying
them
i
shall
get
back
all
the
bonds
which
mountjoy
has
given
and
that
the
money
can
be
at
once
raised
upon
a
joint
mortgage
to
be
executed
by
me
and
augustus
i
will
do
it
but
the
first
thing
must
be
to
know
the
amount
i
will
join
augustus
in
nothing
without
your
consent
he
wants
to
assume
the
power
himself
in
fact
the
one
thing
he
desires
is
that
i
shall
go
as
long
as
i
remain
he
shall
do
nothing
except
by
my
i
will
see
you
and
him
and
now
you
may
go
and
eat
your
dinner
i
can
not
tell
you
how
much
obliged
i
am
to
you
for
coming
and
then
grey
left
the
room
went
to
his
chamber
and
in
process
of
time
made
his
way
into
the
chapter
xx
grey
opinion
of
the
scarborough
family
had
augustus
been
really
anxious
to
see
grey
before
grey
went
to
his
father
he
would
probably
have
managed
to
do
so
he
did
not
always
tell
jones
everything
so
the
fellow
has
hurried
up
to
the
governor
the
moment
he
came
into
the
house
he
said
he
with
him
now
of
course
he
is
never
mind
i
be
even
with
him
in
the
then
he
greeted
the
lawyer
with
a
mock
courtesy
as
soon
as
he
saw
him
i
hope
your
journey
has
done
you
no
harm
mr
grey
not
in
the
least
it
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
to
look
after
our
poor
concerns
with
so
much
interest
jones
do
you
think
it
is
time
they
gave
us
some
dinner
grey
i
sure
must
want
his
dinner
all
in
good
time
said
the
lawyer
you
shall
have
your
dinner
grey
it
is
the
least
we
can
do
for
you
grey
felt
that
in
every
sound
of
his
voice
there
was
an
insult
and
took
special
notice
of
every
tone
and
booked
them
all
down
in
his
memory
after
dinner
he
asked
some
unimportant
question
with
reference
to
the
meeting
that
was
to
take
place
in
the
morning
and
was
at
once
rebuked
i
do
not
know
that
we
need
trouble
our
friend
here
with
our
private
concerns
he
said
not
in
the
least
said
grey
you
have
already
been
talking
about
them
in
my
presence
and
in
his
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
have
a
list
of
the
creditors
before
i
can
advise
your
father
i
do
see
it
but
however
that
is
for
you
to
judge
indeed
i
do
not
know
on
what
points
my
father
wants
your
advice
a
lawyer
generally
furnishes
such
a
list
then
grey
took
up
a
book
and
was
soon
left
alone
by
the
younger
men
in
the
morning
he
walked
out
in
the
park
so
as
to
have
free
time
for
thought
not
a
word
farther
had
been
said
between
him
and
augustus
touching
their
affairs
at
breakfast
augustus
discussed
with
his
friend
the
state
of
the
odds
respecting
some
race
and
then
the
characters
of
certain
ladies
no
subjects
could
have
been
less
interesting
to
grey
as
augustus
was
aware
they
breakfasted
at
ten
and
twelve
had
been
named
for
the
meeting
grey
had
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
for
his
walk
in
which
he
could
again
turn
over
in
his
mind
all
these
matters
of
which
his
thoughts
had
been
full
for
now
many
a
day
of
two
or
three
facts
he
was
certain
augustus
was
the
legitimate
heir
of
his
father
of
that
he
had
seen
ample
documentary
evidence
the
word
of
no
scarborough
should
go
for
anything
with
him
but
of
that
fact
he
was
assured
whether
the
squire
knew
aught
of
mountjoy
he
did
not
feel
sure
but
that
augustus
did
he
was
quite
certain
who
was
paying
the
bills
for
the
scapegrace
during
his
travels
he
could
not
say
but
he
thought
it
probable
that
augustus
was
finding
the
money
he
mountjoy
was
kept
away
so
as
to
be
out
of
the
creditors
way
he
thought
therefore
that
augustus
was
doing
this
so
that
he
might
the
more
easily
buy
up
the
debts
but
why
should
augustus
go
to
the
expense
of
buying
up
the
debts
seeing
that
the
money
must
ultimately
come
out
of
his
own
pocket
because
so
grey
thought
augustus
would
not
trust
his
own
father
the
creditors
if
they
could
get
hold
of
mountjoy
when
his
father
was
dead
and
when
the
bonds
would
all
become
payable
might
possibly
so
unravel
the
facts
as
to
make
it
apparent
that
after
all
the
property
was
mountjoy
this
was
not
idea
but
was
grey
idea
of
the
calculation
which
augustus
was
making
for
his
own
government
according
to
grey
reading
of
all
the
facts
of
the
case
such
were
the
suspicions
which
augustus
entertained
in
the
matter
otherwise
why
should
he
be
anxious
to
take
a
step
which
would
redound
only
to
the
advantage
of
the
creditors
he
was
quite
certain
that
no
money
would
be
paid
at
any
rate
by
augustus
solely
with
the
view
of
honestly
settling
their
claims
but
there
was
another
subject
which
troubled
his
mind
excessively
as
he
walked
across
the
park
why
should
he
soil
his
hands
or
at
any
rate
trouble
his
conscience
with
an
affair
so
unclean
so
perplexed
and
so
troublesome
why
was
he
there
at
tretton
at
all
to
be
insulted
by
a
young
blackguard
such
as
he
believed
augustus
scarborough
to
be
augustus
scarborough
he
knew
suspected
him
but
he
in
return
suspected
augustus
scarborough
the
creditors
suspected
him
mountjoy
suspected
him
the
squire
did
not
suspect
him
but
he
suspected
the
squire
he
never
could
again
feel
himself
to
be
on
comfortable
terms
of
trusting
legal
friendship
with
a
man
who
had
played
such
a
prank
in
reference
to
his
marriage
as
this
man
had
performed
why
then
should
he
still
be
concerned
in
a
matter
so
distasteful
to
him
why
should
he
not
wipe
his
hands
of
it
all
and
retreat
there
was
no
act
of
parliament
compelling
him
to
meddle
with
the
dirt
such
were
his
thoughts
but
yet
he
knew
that
he
was
compelled
he
did
feel
himself
bound
to
look
after
interests
which
he
had
taken
in
hand
now
for
many
years
it
had
been
his
duty
or
the
duty
of
some
one
belonging
to
him
to
see
into
the
deceit
by
which
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
rob
augustus
scarborough
of
his
patrimony
it
had
been
his
duty
for
a
while
to
protect
mountjoy
and
the
creditors
who
had
lent
their
money
to
mountjoy
from
what
he
had
believed
to
be
a
flagitious
attempt
then
as
soon
as
he
felt
that
the
flagitious
attempt
had
been
made
previously
in
mountjoy
favor
it
became
his
duty
to
protect
augustus
in
spite
of
the
strong
personal
dislike
which
from
the
first
he
had
conceived
for
that
young
man
and
then
he
doubtless
had
been
attracted
by
the
singularity
of
all
that
had
been
done
in
the
affair
and
of
all
that
was
likely
to
be
done
he
had
said
to
himself
that
the
matter
should
be
made
straight
and
that
he
would
make
it
straight
therefore
during
his
walk
in
the
park
he
resolved
that
he
must
persevere
at
twelve
he
was
ready
to
be
taken
up
to
the
sick
man
room
when
he
entered
it
under
the
custody
of
miss
scarborough
he
found
that
augustus
was
there
the
squire
was
sitting
up
with
his
feet
supported
and
was
apparently
in
a
good
humor
well
grey
he
said
have
you
settled
this
matter
with
augustus
i
have
settled
nothing
he
has
not
spoken
to
me
about
it
at
all
said
augustus
i
told
him
i
wanted
a
list
of
the
creditors
he
said
that
it
was
my
duty
to
supply
it
that
was
the
extent
of
our
conversation
which
he
thought
it
expedient
to
have
in
the
presence
of
my
friend
jones
jones
is
very
well
in
his
way
but
he
is
not
acquainted
with
all
my
affairs
your
son
scarborough
has
made
no
tender
to
me
of
any
information
nor
sir
has
grey
sought
for
any
information
from
me
during
this
little
dialogue
scarborough
turned
his
face
with
a
smile
from
one
to
the
other
without
a
word
if
grey
has
anything
to
suggest
in
the
way
of
advice
let
him
suggest
it
said
augustus
now
grey
said
the
squire
with
the
same
smile
till
i
get
farther
information
said
grey
i
can
only
limit
myself
to
giving
the
advice
which
i
offered
to
you
yesterday
perhaps
you
will
repeat
it
so
that
he
may
hear
it
said
the
squire
if
you
get
a
list
of
those
to
whom
your
son
mountjoy
owes
money
and
an
assurance
that
the
moneys
named
in
that
list
have
been
from
time
to
time
lent
by
them
to
him
the
actual
amount
i
mean
then
i
think
that
if
you
and
your
son
augustus
shall
together
choose
to
pay
those
amounts
you
will
make
the
best
reparation
in
your
power
for
the
injury
you
have
no
doubt
done
in
having
contrived
that
it
should
be
understood
that
mountjoy
was
legitimate
you
need
not
discuss
said
the
squire
any
injuries
that
i
have
done
i
have
done
a
great
many
no
doubt
but
continued
the
lawyer
before
any
such
payment
is
made
close
inquiries
should
be
instituted
as
to
the
amounts
of
money
which
have
absolutely
passed
we
should
certainly
be
taken
in
said
the
squire
i
have
great
admiration
for
samuel
hart
i
do
believe
that
it
would
be
found
impossible
to
extract
the
truth
from
samuel
hart
if
samuel
hart
does
not
make
money
yet
out
of
poor
mountjoy
i
shall
be
surprised
the
truth
may
be
ascertained
said
grey
you
should
get
some
accountant
to
examine
the
checks
when
i
remember
how
easy
it
was
to
deceive
some
really
clever
men
as
to
the
evidence
of
my
marriage
began
scarborough
so
the
squire
began
but
then
stopped
himself
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
among
the
really
clever
men
who
had
been
easily
deceived
grey
was
if
not
actually
first
in
importance
foremost
at
any
rate
in
name
the
truth
may
be
ascertained
grey
repeated
almost
with
a
scowl
of
anger
upon
his
brow
well
yes
i
suppose
it
may
it
will
be
difficult
in
opposition
to
samuel
hart
you
must
satisfy
yourselves
at
any
rate
these
men
will
know
that
they
have
no
other
hope
of
getting
a
shilling
it
is
a
little
hard
to
make
them
believe
anything
said
the
squire
they
fancy
you
know
that
if
they
could
get
a
hold
of
mountjoy
so
as
to
have
him
in
their
hands
when
the
breath
is
out
of
my
body
and
the
bonds
are
really
due
that
then
it
may
be
made
to
turn
out
that
he
is
really
the
heir
we
know
that
it
is
not
so
said
grey
at
this
augustus
smiled
blandly
we
know
but
it
is
what
we
can
make
samuel
hart
know
in
truth
samuel
hart
never
allows
himself
to
know
anything
except
the
amount
of
money
which
he
may
have
at
his
banker
and
it
will
be
difficult
to
convince
tyrrwhit
tyrrwhit
is
assured
that
all
of
us
you
and
i
and
mountjoy
and
augustus
are
in
a
conspiracy
to
cheat
him
and
the
others
i
do
wonder
at
it
said
grey
perhaps
not
continued
the
squire
the
circumstances
no
doubt
are
suspicious
but
he
will
have
to
find
out
his
mistake
augustus
is
very
anxious
to
pay
these
poor
men
their
money
it
is
a
noble
feeling
on
the
part
of
augustus
you
must
admit
that
mr
grey
the
irony
with
which
this
was
said
was
evident
in
the
squire
face
and
voice
augustus
only
quietly
laughed
the
attorney
sat
as
firm
as
death
he
was
not
going
to
argue
with
such
a
statement
or
to
laugh
at
such
a
joke
i
suppose
it
will
come
to
over
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
eighty
thousand
i
should
think
said
augustus
the
bonds
amount
to
a
great
deal
more
than
that
twice
that
it
is
for
him
to
judge
said
the
squire
whether
he
is
bound
by
his
honor
to
pay
so
large
a
sum
to
men
whom
i
do
not
suppose
he
loves
very
well
the
estate
can
bear
it
said
augustus
yes
the
estate
can
bear
it
said
the
attorney
they
should
be
paid
what
they
have
expended
that
is
my
idea
your
son
thinks
that
their
silence
will
be
worth
the
money
what
makes
you
say
that
demanded
augustus
just
my
own
opinion
i
look
upon
it
as
an
insult
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
explain
to
us
what
is
your
reason
for
wishing
to
do
this
thing
asked
grey
no
sir
i
decline
to
give
any
reason
but
those
which
you
ascribe
to
me
are
insulting
will
you
deny
them
i
will
not
assent
to
anything
coming
from
you
nor
will
i
deny
anything
it
is
altogether
out
of
your
place
as
an
attorney
to
ascribe
motives
to
your
clients
can
you
raise
the
money
so
that
it
shall
be
forthcoming
at
once
that
is
the
question
on
your
father
authority
backed
by
your
signature
i
imagine
that
i
can
do
so
but
i
will
not
answer
as
a
certainty
the
best
thing
would
be
to
sell
a
portion
of
the
property
if
you
and
your
father
will
join
and
mountjoy
also
with
you
it
may
be
done
what
has
mountjoy
got
to
do
with
it
asked
the
father
you
had
better
have
mountjoy
also
there
may
be
some
doubt
as
to
the
title
people
will
think
so
after
the
tricks
that
have
been
played
this
was
said
by
the
lawyer
but
the
squire
only
laughed
he
always
showed
some
enjoyment
of
the
fun
which
arose
from
the
effects
of
his
own
scheming
the
legal
world
with
its
entails
had
endeavored
to
dispose
of
his
property
but
he
had
shown
the
legal
world
that
it
was
not
an
easy
task
to
dispose
of
anything
in
which
he
was
concerned
how
will
you
get
hold
of
mountjoy
asked
augustus
then
the
two
older
men
only
looked
at
each
other
both
of
them
believed
that
augustus
knew
more
about
his
brother
than
any
one
else
i
think
you
had
better
send
to
annesley
and
ask
him
what
does
annesley
know
about
him
asked
the
squire
he
was
the
last
person
who
saw
him
at
any
rate
in
london
are
you
sure
of
that
said
grey
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
am
i
think
at
any
rate
that
i
know
that
there
was
a
violent
quarrel
between
them
in
the
streets
a
quarrel
in
which
the
two
men
proceeded
to
blows
and
that
annesley
struck
him
in
such
a
way
as
to
leave
him
for
dead
upon
the
pavement
then
the
young
man
walked
away
and
mountjoy
has
not
been
heard
of
or
at
least
has
not
been
seen
since
that
a
man
should
have
struck
such
a
blow
and
then
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
thinking
of
his
own
safety
should
have
left
his
opponent
i
can
understand
i
should
not
like
to
be
accused
of
such
treatment
myself
but
i
can
understand
it
i
can
not
understand
that
the
man
should
have
been
missing
altogether
and
that
then
he
should
have
held
his
tongue
how
do
you
know
all
this
asked
the
attorney
it
is
sufficient
that
i
do
know
it
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
said
the
squire
coming
from
you
of
course
i
must
put
up
with
any
contradiction
said
augustus
i
should
not
bear
it
from
any
one
else
and
he
looked
at
the
attorney
one
has
a
right
to
ask
for
your
authority
said
his
father
i
can
not
give
it
a
lady
is
concerned
whose
name
i
shall
not
mention
but
it
is
of
less
importance
as
his
own
friends
are
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
his
conduct
indeed
it
seems
odd
to
see
you
two
gentlemen
so
ignorant
as
to
the
matter
which
has
been
a
subject
of
common
conversation
in
most
circles
his
uncle
means
to
cut
him
out
from
the
property
can
he
too
deal
with
entails
said
the
squire
he
is
still
in
middle
life
and
he
can
marry
that
is
what
he
intended
to
do
so
much
is
he
disgusted
with
his
nephew
he
has
already
stopped
the
young
man
allowance
and
swears
that
he
shall
not
have
a
shilling
of
his
money
if
he
can
help
it
the
police
for
some
time
were
in
great
doubt
whether
they
would
not
arrest
him
i
think
i
am
justified
in
saying
that
he
is
a
thorough
reprobate
you
are
not
at
all
justified
said
the
father
i
can
only
express
my
opinion
and
am
glad
to
say
that
the
world
agrees
with
me
it
is
sickening
absolutely
sickening
said
the
squire
turning
to
the
attorney
you
would
not
believe
now
but
he
stopped
himself
what
would
not
grey
believe
asked
the
son
there
is
no
one
one
knows
better
than
you
that
after
the
row
in
the
street
when
mountjoy
was
i
believe
the
aggressor
he
was
again
seen
by
another
person
i
hate
such
deceit
and
scheming
here
augustus
smiled
what
are
you
sniggering
there
at
you
blockhead
your
hatred
sir
at
deceit
and
scheming
the
truth
is
that
when
a
man
plays
a
game
well
he
does
not
like
to
find
that
he
has
any
equal
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
say
that
there
is
rivalry
here
you
sir
are
so
the
first
that
no
one
can
touch
you
then
he
laughed
long
a
low
bitter
inaudible
laugh
during
which
grey
sat
silent
this
comes
well
from
you
said
the
father
well
sir
you
would
try
your
hand
upon
me
i
have
passed
over
all
that
you
have
done
on
my
behalf
but
when
you
come
to
abuse
me
i
can
not
quite
take
your
words
as
calmly
as
though
there
had
been
no
shall
i
say
antecedents
now
about
this
money
are
we
to
pay
it
i
do
care
one
straw
about
the
money
what
is
it
to
me
i
do
owe
these
creditors
anything
nor
do
i
let
them
rest
then
and
do
the
worst
they
can
but
upon
the
whole
grey
he
added
after
a
pause
i
think
we
had
better
pay
them
they
have
endeavored
to
be
insolent
to
me
and
i
have
therefore
ignored
their
claim
i
have
told
them
to
do
their
worst
if
my
son
here
will
agree
with
you
in
raising
the
money
and
if
mountjoy
as
he
too
is
necessary
will
do
so
i
too
will
do
what
is
required
of
me
if
eighty
thousand
pounds
will
settle
it
all
there
ought
not
to
be
any
difficulty
you
can
inquire
what
the
real
amount
would
be
if
they
choose
to
hold
to
their
bonds
nothing
will
come
of
it
that
all
very
well
scarborough
then
i
shall
know
how
to
proceed
i
understand
that
scarborough
junior
is
an
assenting
party
scarborough
junior
signified
his
assent
by
nodding
his
head
that
will
do
then
for
i
think
that
i
have
a
little
exhausted
myself
then
he
turned
round
upon
his
couch
as
though
he
intended
to
slumber
grey
left
the
room
and
augustus
followed
him
but
not
a
word
was
spoken
between
them
grey
had
an
early
dinner
and
went
up
to
london
by
an
evening
train
what
became
of
augustus
he
did
not
inquire
but
simply
asked
for
his
dinner
and
for
a
conveyance
to
the
train
these
were
forthcoming
and
he
returned
that
night
to
fulham
well
said
dolly
as
soon
as
she
had
got
him
his
slippers
and
made
him
his
tea
i
wish
with
all
my
heart
i
had
never
seen
any
one
of
the
name
of
scarborough
that
is
of
course
but
what
have
you
done
the
father
has
been
a
great
knave
he
has
set
the
laws
of
his
country
at
defiance
and
should
be
punished
most
severely
and
mountjoy
scarborough
has
proved
himself
to
be
unfit
to
have
any
money
in
his
hands
a
man
so
reckless
is
little
better
than
a
lunatic
but
compared
with
augustus
they
are
both
estimable
amiable
men
the
father
has
ideas
of
philanthropy
and
mountjoy
is
simply
mad
but
augustus
is
as
dishonest
as
either
of
them
and
is
odious
also
all
round
then
at
length
he
explained
all
that
he
had
learned
and
all
that
he
had
advised
and
at
last
went
to
bed
combating
dolly
idea
that
the
scarboroughs
ought
now
to
be
thrown
over
altogether
chapter
xxi
scarborough
thoughts
of
himself
when
scarborough
was
left
alone
he
did
not
go
to
sleep
as
he
had
pretended
but
lay
there
for
an
hour
thinking
of
his
position
and
indulging
to
the
full
the
feelings
of
anger
which
he
now
entertained
toward
his
second
son
he
had
never
in
truth
loved
augustus
augustus
was
very
like
his
father
in
his
capacity
for
organizing
deceit
for
plotting
and
so
contriving
that
his
own
will
should
be
in
opposition
to
the
wills
of
all
those
around
him
but
they
were
thoroughly
unlike
in
the
object
to
be
attained
scarborough
was
not
a
selfish
man
augustus
was
selfish
and
nothing
else
scarborough
hated
the
law
because
it
was
the
law
and
endeavored
to
put
a
restraint
upon
him
and
others
augustus
liked
the
law
unless
when
in
particular
points
it
interfered
with
his
own
actions
scarborough
thought
that
he
could
do
better
than
the
law
augustus
wished
to
do
worse
scarborough
never
blushed
at
what
he
himself
attempted
unless
he
failed
which
was
not
often
the
case
but
he
was
constantly
driven
to
blush
for
his
son
augustus
blushed
for
nothing
and
for
nobody
when
scarborough
had
declared
to
the
attorney
that
just
praise
was
due
to
augustus
for
the
nobility
of
the
sacrifice
he
was
making
augustus
had
understood
his
father
accurately
and
determined
to
be
revenged
not
because
of
the
expression
of
his
father
thoughts
but
because
he
had
so
expressed
himself
before
the
attorney
scarborough
also
thought
that
he
was
entitled
to
his
revenge
when
he
had
been
left
alone
for
an
hour
he
rung
the
bell
which
was
close
at
his
side
and
called
for
merton
where
is
mr
grey
i
think
he
has
ordered
the
wagonette
to
take
him
to
the
station
and
where
is
augustus
i
do
not
know
and
jones
i
suppose
they
have
not
gone
to
the
station
just
feel
my
pulse
merton
i
am
afraid
i
am
very
weak
merton
felt
his
pulse
and
shook
his
head
there
is
a
pulse
so
to
speak
oh
yes
but
it
is
irregular
if
you
will
exert
yourself
so
violently
that
is
all
very
well
but
a
man
has
to
exert
himself
sometimes
let
the
penalty
be
what
it
may
when
do
you
think
that
sir
william
will
have
to
come
again
sir
william
when
he
came
would
come
with
his
knife
and
his
advent
was
always
to
be
feared
it
depends
very
much
on
yourself
scarborough
i
do
think
he
can
come
very
often
but
you
can
make
the
distances
long
or
short
you
should
attend
to
no
business
that
is
absolute
rubbish
nevertheless
it
is
my
duty
to
say
so
whatever
arrangements
may
be
required
they
should
be
made
by
others
of
course
if
you
do
as
you
have
done
this
morning
i
can
suggest
some
little
relief
i
can
give
you
tonics
and
increase
the
amount
but
i
can
not
resist
the
evil
which
you
yourself
do
yourself
i
understand
all
about
it
you
will
kill
yourself
if
you
go
on
i
do
mean
to
go
on
any
farther
not
as
i
have
done
but
as
to
giving
up
business
that
is
rubbish
i
have
got
my
property
to
manage
and
i
mean
to
manage
it
myself
as
long
as
i
live
unfortunately
there
have
been
accidents
which
make
the
management
a
little
rough
at
times
i
have
had
one
of
the
rough
moments
but
they
shall
not
be
repeated
i
give
you
my
word
for
that
but
do
not
talk
to
me
about
giving
up
my
business
now
i
take
your
tonics
and
then
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
ask
my
sister
to
come
to
me
miss
scarborough
who
was
always
in
waiting
on
her
brother
was
at
once
in
the
room
martha
he
said
where
is
augustus
i
think
he
has
gone
out
and
where
is
septimus
jones
he
is
with
him
john
the
two
are
always
together
you
would
not
mind
giving
my
compliments
to
jones
and
telling
him
that
his
bedroom
is
wanted
his
bedroom
wanted
there
are
lots
of
bedrooms
and
nobody
to
occupy
them
it
a
hint
that
i
want
him
to
go
he
understand
that
would
it
not
be
better
to
tell
augustus
asked
the
lady
doubting
much
her
power
to
carry
out
the
instructions
given
to
her
he
would
tell
augustus
it
is
not
you
see
any
objection
i
have
to
jones
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
he
is
a
most
agreeable
young
man
i
sure
but
i
do
not
care
to
entertain
an
agreeable
young
man
without
having
a
word
to
say
on
the
subject
augustus
does
not
think
it
worth
his
while
even
to
speak
to
me
about
him
of
course
when
i
am
gone
in
a
month
or
so
perhaps
a
week
or
two
he
can
do
as
he
pleases
do
john
but
it
is
so
while
i
live
i
am
master
at
least
of
this
house
i
can
not
see
jones
and
i
do
not
wish
to
have
another
quarrel
with
augustus
merton
says
that
every
time
i
get
angry
it
gives
sir
william
another
chance
with
the
knife
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
could
do
it
then
miss
scarborough
promised
that
she
would
do
it
and
having
her
brother
health
very
much
at
heart
she
did
do
it
augustus
stood
smiling
while
the
message
was
in
fact
conveyed
to
him
but
he
made
no
answer
when
the
lady
had
done
he
bobbed
his
head
to
signify
that
he
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
it
and
the
lady
retired
i
have
got
my
he
said
to
septimus
jones
ten
minutes
afterward
i
do
know
what
you
mean
do
you
then
you
must
be
very
my
father
has
sent
me
word
that
you
are
to
be
turned
out
of
course
he
means
it
for
me
he
does
not
wish
to
give
me
the
power
of
saying
that
he
sent
me
away
from
the
house
me
whom
he
has
so
long
endeavored
to
rob
me
to
whom
he
owes
so
much
for
taking
no
steps
to
punish
his
fraud
and
he
knows
that
i
can
take
none
because
he
is
on
his
but
you
could
could
you
if
he
were
were
anywhere
else
could
i
that
all
you
know
about
it
understand
however
that
i
shall
start
morning
and
unless
you
like
to
remain
here
on
a
visit
to
him
you
had
better
go
with
me
jones
signified
his
compliance
with
the
hint
and
so
miss
scarborough
had
done
her
work
scarborough
when
thus
left
alone
spent
his
time
chiefly
in
thinking
of
the
condition
of
his
sons
his
eldest
son
mountjoy
who
had
ever
been
his
favorite
whom
as
a
little
boy
he
had
spoiled
by
every
means
in
his
power
was
a
ruined
man
his
debts
had
all
been
paid
except
the
money
due
to
the
but
he
was
not
the
less
a
ruined
man
where
he
was
at
this
moment
his
father
did
not
know
all
the
world
knew
the
injustice
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
on
his
behalf
and
all
the
world
knew
the
failure
of
the
endeavor
and
now
he
had
made
a
great
and
a
successful
effort
to
give
back
to
his
legitimate
heir
all
the
property
but
in
return
the
second
son
only
desired
his
death
and
almost
told
him
so
to
his
face
he
had
been
proud
of
augustus
as
a
lad
but
he
had
never
loved
him
as
he
had
loved
mountjoy
now
he
knew
that
he
and
augustus
must
henceforward
be
enemies
never
for
a
moment
did
he
think
of
giving
up
his
power
over
the
estate
as
long
as
the
estate
should
still
be
his
though
it
should
be
but
for
a
month
though
it
should
be
but
for
a
week
he
would
hold
his
own
such
was
the
nature
of
the
man
and
when
he
swallowed
merton
tonics
he
did
so
more
with
the
idea
of
keeping
the
property
out
of
his
son
hands
than
of
preserving
his
own
life
according
to
his
view
he
had
done
very
much
for
augustus
and
this
was
the
return
which
he
received
and
in
truth
he
had
done
much
for
augustus
for
years
past
it
had
been
his
object
to
leave
to
his
second
son
as
much
as
would
come
to
his
first
he
had
continued
to
put
money
by
for
him
instead
of
spending
his
income
on
himself
of
this
grey
had
known
much
but
had
said
nothing
when
he
was
speaking
those
severe
words
which
scarborough
had
always
contrived
to
receive
with
laughter
but
he
had
felt
their
injustice
though
he
had
himself
ridiculed
the
idea
of
law
there
had
been
the
two
sons
both
born
from
the
same
mother
and
he
had
willed
that
they
should
be
both
rich
men
living
among
the
foremost
of
their
fellowmen
and
the
circumstances
of
the
property
would
have
helped
him
the
income
from
year
to
year
went
on
increasing
the
of
tretton
and
the
town
of
tretton
had
grown
and
been
expanded
within
his
domain
and
the
management
of
the
sales
in
grey
hands
had
been
judicious
the
revenues
were
double
now
what
they
had
been
when
scarborough
first
inherited
it
it
was
all
no
doubt
entailed
but
for
twenty
years
he
had
enjoyed
the
power
of
accumulating
a
sum
of
money
for
his
second
son
sake
or
would
have
enjoyed
it
had
not
the
accumulation
been
taken
from
him
to
pay
mountjoy
debts
it
was
in
vain
that
he
attempted
to
make
mountjoy
responsible
for
the
money
mountjoy
debts
and
irregularities
and
gambling
went
on
till
scarborough
found
himself
bound
to
dethrone
the
illegitimate
son
and
to
place
the
legitimate
in
his
proper
position
in
doing
the
deed
he
had
not
suffered
much
though
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
the
doing
of
it
had
been
full
of
pain
there
had
been
an
actual
pleasure
to
him
in
thus
showing
himself
to
be
superior
to
the
conventionalities
of
the
world
there
was
augustus
still
ready
to
occupy
the
position
to
which
he
had
in
truth
been
born
and
at
the
moment
mountjoy
had
gone
he
knew
not
where
there
had
been
gambling
debts
which
coming
as
they
did
after
many
others
he
had
refused
to
pay
he
himself
was
dying
at
the
moment
as
he
thought
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
take
up
with
augustus
mountjoy
he
must
leave
to
his
fate
for
such
a
son
so
reckless
so
incurable
so
hopeless
it
was
impossible
that
anything
farther
should
be
done
he
would
at
least
enjoy
the
power
of
leaving
those
wretched
creditors
without
their
money
there
would
be
some
triumph
some
consolation
in
that
so
he
had
done
and
now
his
heir
turned
against
him
it
was
very
bitter
to
him
as
he
lay
thinking
of
it
all
he
was
a
man
who
was
from
his
constitution
and
heart
capable
of
making
great
sacrifices
for
those
he
loved
he
had
a
most
thorough
contempt
for
the
character
of
an
honest
man
he
did
not
believe
in
honesty
but
only
in
mock
honesty
and
yet
he
would
speak
of
an
honest
man
with
admiration
meaning
something
altogether
different
from
the
honesty
of
which
men
ordinarily
spoke
the
usual
honesty
of
the
world
was
with
him
all
pretence
or
if
not
assumed
for
the
sake
of
the
character
it
would
achieve
grey
he
knew
to
be
honest
grey
word
he
knew
to
be
true
but
he
fancied
that
grey
had
adopted
this
absurd
mode
of
living
with
the
view
of
cheating
his
neighbors
by
appearing
to
be
better
than
others
all
virtue
and
all
vice
were
comprised
by
him
in
the
words
and
all
propensities
and
these
propensities
in
his
estimate
extended
very
widely
he
scorned
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
heart
that
one
set
of
words
should
be
deemed
more
wicked
than
another
as
in
regard
to
swearing
was
to
him
a
sign
either
of
hypocrisy
of
idolatry
or
of
feminine
weakness
of
intellect
to
women
he
allowed
the
privilege
of
being
in
regard
to
thought
only
something
better
than
dogs
when
his
sister
martha
shuddered
at
some
exclamation
from
his
mouth
he
would
say
to
himself
simply
that
she
was
a
woman
not
an
idiot
or
a
hypocrite
of
women
old
and
young
he
had
been
very
fond
and
in
his
manner
to
them
very
tender
but
when
a
woman
rose
to
a
way
of
thinking
akin
to
his
own
she
was
no
longer
a
woman
to
his
senses
against
such
a
one
his
taste
revolted
she
sunk
to
the
level
of
a
man
contaminated
by
petticoats
and
law
was
hardly
less
absurd
to
him
than
religion
it
consisted
of
a
perplexed
entanglement
of
rules
got
together
so
that
the
few
might
live
in
comfort
at
the
expense
of
the
many
robbery
if
you
could
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
was
bad
as
was
all
violence
but
taxation
was
robbery
rent
was
robbery
prices
fixed
according
to
the
desire
of
the
seller
and
not
in
obedience
to
justice
were
robbery
then
you
are
the
greatest
of
robbers
his
friends
would
say
to
him
he
would
admit
it
allowing
that
in
such
a
state
of
society
he
was
not
prepared
to
go
out
and
live
naked
in
the
streets
if
he
could
help
it
but
he
delighted
to
get
the
better
of
the
law
and
triumphed
in
his
own
iniquity
as
has
been
seen
by
his
conduct
in
reference
to
his
sons
in
this
way
he
lived
and
was
kind
to
many
people
having
a
generous
and
an
open
hand
but
he
was
a
man
who
could
hate
with
a
bitter
hatred
and
he
hated
most
those
suspected
by
him
of
mean
or
dirty
conduct
grey
who
constantly
told
him
to
his
face
that
he
was
a
rascal
he
did
not
hate
at
all
thinking
grey
to
be
in
some
respects
idiotic
he
respected
him
and
almost
loved
him
he
thoroughly
believed
grey
thinking
him
to
be
an
ass
for
telling
so
much
truth
unnecessarily
and
he
had
loved
his
son
mountjoy
in
spite
of
all
his
iniquities
and
had
fostered
him
till
it
was
impossible
to
foster
him
any
longer
then
he
had
endeavored
to
love
augustus
and
did
not
in
the
least
love
him
the
less
because
his
son
told
him
frequently
of
the
wicked
things
he
had
done
he
did
not
object
to
be
told
of
his
wickedness
even
by
his
son
but
augustus
suspected
him
of
other
things
than
those
of
which
he
accused
him
and
attempted
to
be
sharp
with
him
and
to
get
the
better
of
him
at
his
own
game
and
his
son
laughed
at
him
and
scorned
him
and
regarded
him
as
one
who
was
troublesome
only
for
a
time
and
who
need
not
be
treated
with
much
attention
because
he
was
there
only
for
a
time
therefore
he
hated
augustus
but
augustus
was
his
heir
and
he
knew
that
he
must
die
soon
but
for
how
long
could
he
live
and
what
could
he
yet
do
before
he
died
a
braver
man
than
scarborough
never
lived
that
is
one
who
less
feared
to
die
whether
that
is
true
courage
may
be
a
question
but
it
was
his
in
conjunction
with
courage
of
another
description
he
did
not
fear
to
die
nor
did
he
fear
to
live
but
what
he
did
fear
was
to
fail
before
he
died
not
to
go
out
with
the
conviction
that
he
was
vanishing
amid
the
glory
of
success
was
to
him
to
be
wretched
at
his
last
moment
and
to
be
wretched
at
his
last
moment
or
to
anticipate
that
he
should
be
so
was
to
him
even
so
near
his
last
hours
the
acme
of
misery
how
much
of
life
was
left
to
him
so
that
he
might
recover
something
of
success
or
was
any
moment
left
to
him
he
could
not
sleep
so
he
rung
his
bell
and
again
sent
for
merton
i
have
taken
what
you
told
me
so
best
said
merton
for
he
did
not
always
feel
assured
that
this
strange
patient
would
take
what
had
been
ordered
and
i
have
tried
to
sleep
that
will
come
after
a
while
you
would
not
naturally
sleep
just
after
the
tonic
and
i
have
been
thinking
of
what
you
said
about
business
there
is
one
thing
i
must
do
and
then
i
can
remain
quiet
for
a
fortnight
unless
i
should
be
called
upon
to
disturb
my
rest
by
dying
we
will
hope
not
that
may
go
as
it
pleases
said
the
sick
man
i
want
you
now
to
write
a
letter
for
me
to
mr
grey
merton
had
undertaken
to
perform
the
duties
of
secretary
as
well
as
doctor
and
had
thought
in
this
way
to
obtain
some
authority
over
his
patient
for
the
patient
own
good
but
he
had
found
already
that
no
authority
had
come
to
him
he
now
sat
down
at
the
table
close
to
the
bedside
and
prepared
to
write
in
accordance
with
scarborough
dictation
i
think
that
grey
the
lawyer
you
know
is
a
good
man
the
world
as
far
as
i
hear
it
says
that
he
is
honest
i
do
care
a
straw
what
the
world
says
the
world
says
that
i
am
dishonest
but
i
am
not
merton
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
i
do
say
that
because
i
want
you
to
change
your
opinion
i
do
care
what
you
think
but
i
tell
you
a
fact
i
doubt
whether
grey
is
so
absolutely
honest
as
i
am
but
as
things
go
he
is
a
good
man
certainly
but
the
world
i
suppose
says
that
my
son
augustus
is
honest
well
yes
i
should
suppose
so
if
you
have
looked
into
him
and
have
seen
the
contrary
i
respect
your
intelligence
i
did
not
mean
anything
particular
i
dare
say
not
and
if
so
i
mean
nothing
particular
as
to
your
intelligence
he
at
any
rate
is
a
scoundrel
mountjoy
you
know
mountjoy
never
saw
him
in
my
life
i
do
think
he
is
a
scoundrel
not
all
round
he
has
gambled
when
he
has
not
had
money
to
pay
that
is
bad
and
he
has
promised
when
he
wanted
money
and
broken
his
word
as
soon
as
he
had
got
it
which
is
bad
also
and
he
has
thought
himself
to
be
a
fine
fellow
because
he
has
been
intimate
with
lords
and
dukes
which
is
very
bad
he
has
never
cared
whether
he
paid
his
tailor
i
do
not
mean
that
he
has
merely
got
into
debt
which
a
young
man
such
as
he
can
not
help
but
he
has
not
cared
whether
his
breeches
were
his
or
another
man
that
too
is
bad
though
he
has
been
passionately
fond
of
women
it
has
only
been
for
himself
not
for
the
women
which
is
very
bad
there
is
an
immense
deal
to
be
altered
before
he
can
go
to
heaven
i
hope
the
change
may
come
before
it
is
too
late
said
merton
these
changes
do
come
very
suddenly
you
know
but
there
is
some
chance
for
mountjoy
i
do
think
that
there
is
any
for
augustus
here
he
paused
but
merton
did
not
feel
disposed
to
make
any
remark
you
do
happen
to
know
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
annesley
harry
annesley
i
have
heard
his
name
from
your
son
from
augustus
then
you
did
hear
any
good
of
him
i
sure
you
have
heard
all
the
row
about
poor
mountjoy
disappearance
i
heard
that
he
did
disappear
after
a
quarrel
with
that
annesley
after
some
quarrel
i
did
not
notice
the
name
at
the
time
harry
annesley
was
the
name
now
augustus
says
that
harry
annesley
was
the
last
person
who
saw
mountjoy
before
his
disappearance
the
last
who
knew
him
he
implies
thereby
that
annesley
was
the
conscious
or
unconscious
cause
of
his
disappearance
well
yes
certainly
it
is
so
and
as
it
has
been
thought
by
the
police
and
by
other
fools
that
mountjoy
was
murdered
that
his
disappearance
was
occasioned
by
his
death
either
by
murder
or
suicide
it
follows
that
annesley
must
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
that
is
the
inference
is
it
not
i
should
suppose
so
said
merton
that
is
manifestly
the
inference
which
augustus
draws
to
hear
him
speak
to
me
about
it
you
would
suppose
that
he
suspected
annesley
of
having
killed
mountjoy
not
that
i
hope
something
of
the
sort
he
has
intended
it
to
be
believed
that
annesley
for
his
own
purposes
has
caused
mountjoy
to
be
made
away
with
he
has
endeavored
to
fill
the
police
with
that
idea
a
policeman
generally
is
the
biggest
fool
that
london
or
england
or
the
world
produces
and
has
been
selected
on
that
account
therefore
the
police
have
a
beautifully
mysterious
but
altogether
ignorant
suspicion
as
to
annesley
that
is
the
doing
of
augustus
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
now
let
me
tell
you
that
augustus
saw
mountjoy
after
annesley
had
seen
him
that
he
knows
this
to
be
the
case
and
that
it
was
augustus
who
contrived
disappearance
now
what
do
you
think
of
augustus
this
was
a
question
which
merton
did
not
find
it
very
easy
to
answer
but
scarborough
waited
for
a
reply
eh
he
exclaimed
i
had
rather
not
give
an
opinion
on
a
point
so
raised
you
may
of
course
you
understand
that
i
intend
to
assert
that
augustus
is
the
greatest
blackguard
you
ever
knew
if
you
have
anything
to
say
in
his
favor
you
can
say
it
only
that
you
may
be
mistaken
living
down
here
you
may
not
know
the
truth
just
that
but
i
do
know
the
truth
augustus
is
very
clever
but
there
are
others
as
clever
as
he
is
he
can
pay
but
then
so
can
i
that
he
should
want
to
get
mountjoy
out
of
the
way
is
intelligible
mountjoy
has
become
disreputable
and
had
better
be
out
of
the
way
but
why
persistently
endeavor
to
throw
the
blame
upon
young
annesley
that
surprises
me
only
i
do
not
care
much
about
it
i
hear
now
for
the
first
time
that
he
has
ruined
young
annesley
and
that
does
appear
to
be
very
horrible
but
why
does
he
want
to
pay
eighty
thousand
pounds
to
these
creditors
that
i
should
wish
to
do
so
out
of
a
property
which
must
in
a
very
short
time
become
his
would
be
intelligible
i
may
be
supposed
to
have
some
affection
for
mountjoy
and
after
all
am
not
called
upon
to
pay
the
money
out
of
my
own
pocket
do
you
understand
it
not
in
the
least
said
merton
who
did
not
indeed
very
much
care
about
it
nor
do
i
only
this
that
if
he
could
pay
these
men
and
deprive
them
of
all
power
of
obtaining
farther
payment
let
who
would
have
the
property
they
at
any
rate
would
be
quiet
augustus
is
now
my
eldest
son
perhaps
he
thinks
he
might
not
remain
so
if
i
were
out
of
the
way
and
these
creditors
were
paid
he
thinks
that
poor
mountjoy
would
have
a
chance
he
shall
pay
this
eighty
thousand
pounds
mountjoy
has
a
chance
as
it
is
but
augustus
shall
pay
the
penalty
then
he
threw
himself
back
on
the
bed
and
merton
begged
him
to
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
the
letter
for
the
present
but
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
again
on
his
elbow
and
took
some
farther
medicine
i
a
great
ass
he
said
to
help
augustus
in
playing
his
game
if
i
were
to
go
off
at
once
he
would
be
the
happiest
fellow
left
alive
but
come
let
us
begin
then
he
dictated
the
letter
as
follows
dear
grey
i
have
been
thinking
much
of
what
passed
between
us
the
other
day
augustus
seems
to
be
in
a
great
hurry
as
to
paying
the
creditors
and
i
do
not
see
why
he
should
not
be
gratified
as
the
money
may
now
be
forthcoming
i
presume
that
the
sales
which
will
be
completed
before
christmas
will
nearly
enable
us
to
stop
their
mouths
i
can
understand
that
mountjoy
should
be
induced
to
join
with
me
and
augustus
so
that
in
disposing
of
so
large
a
sum
of
money
the
authority
of
all
may
be
given
both
of
myself
and
of
the
heir
and
also
of
him
who
a
short
time
since
was
supposed
to
be
the
heir
i
think
that
you
may
possibly
find
mountjoy
address
by
applying
to
augustus
who
is
always
clever
in
such
matters
but
you
will
have
to
be
certain
that
you
obtain
all
the
bonds
if
you
can
get
tyrrwhit
to
help
you
you
will
be
able
to
be
sure
of
doing
so
the
matter
to
him
is
one
of
vital
importance
as
his
sum
is
so
much
the
largest
of
course
he
will
open
his
mouth
very
wide
but
when
he
finds
that
he
can
get
his
principal
and
nothing
more
i
think
that
he
will
help
you
i
am
afraid
that
i
must
ask
you
to
put
yourself
in
correspondence
with
augustus
that
he
is
an
insolent
scoundrel
i
will
admit
but
we
can
not
very
well
complete
this
affair
without
him
i
fancy
that
he
now
feels
it
to
be
his
interest
to
get
it
all
done
before
i
die
as
the
men
will
be
clamorous
with
their
bonds
as
soon
as
the
breath
is
out
of
my
yours
sincerely
john
scarborough
that
will
do
he
said
when
the
letter
was
finished
but
when
merton
turned
to
leave
the
room
scarborough
detained
him
upon
the
whole
i
am
not
dissatisfied
with
my
life
he
said
i
do
know
that
you
have
occasion
rejoined
merton
in
this
he
absolutely
lied
for
according
to
his
thinking
there
was
very
much
in
the
affairs
of
scarborough
life
which
ought
to
have
induced
regret
he
knew
the
whole
story
of
the
birth
of
the
elder
son
of
the
subsequent
marriage
of
scarborough
fraudulent
deceit
which
had
lasted
so
many
years
and
of
his
later
return
to
the
truth
so
as
to
save
the
property
and
to
give
back
to
the
younger
son
all
of
which
for
so
many
years
he
his
father
had
attempted
to
rob
him
all
london
had
talked
of
the
affair
and
all
london
had
declared
that
so
wicked
and
dishonest
an
old
gentleman
had
never
lived
and
now
he
had
returned
to
the
truth
simply
with
the
view
of
cheating
the
creditors
and
keeping
the
estate
in
the
family
he
was
manifestly
an
old
gentleman
who
ought
to
be
above
all
others
dissatisfied
with
his
own
life
but
merton
when
the
assertion
was
made
to
him
knew
not
what
other
answer
to
make
i
really
do
not
think
i
have
nor
do
i
know
one
to
whom
heaven
with
all
its
bliss
will
be
more
readily
accorded
what
have
i
done
for
myself
i
do
quite
know
what
you
have
done
all
your
life
i
was
born
a
rich
man
and
then
i
married
not
rich
as
i
am
now
but
with
ample
means
for
marrying
after
mountjoy
birth
said
merton
who
could
not
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
well
yes
i
have
my
own
ideas
about
marriage
and
that
kind
of
thing
which
are
perhaps
at
variance
with
yours
whereupon
merton
bowed
i
had
the
best
wife
in
the
world
who
entirely
coincided
with
me
in
all
that
i
did
i
lived
entirely
abroad
and
made
most
liberal
allowances
to
all
the
agricultural
tenants
i
rebuilt
all
the
cottages
go
and
look
at
them
i
let
any
man
shoot
his
own
game
till
mountjoy
came
up
in
the
world
and
took
the
shooting
into
his
own
hands
when
the
people
at
the
pottery
began
to
build
i
assisted
them
in
every
way
in
the
world
i
offered
to
keep
a
school
at
my
own
expense
solely
on
the
understanding
that
what
they
call
dissenters
should
be
allowed
to
come
there
the
parson
spread
abroad
a
rumor
that
i
was
an
atheist
and
consequently
the
school
was
kept
for
the
dissenters
only
the
has
come
and
made
that
all
right
though
the
parson
goes
on
with
his
rumor
if
he
understood
me
as
well
as
i
understand
him
he
would
know
that
he
is
more
of
an
atheist
than
i
am
i
gave
my
boys
the
best
education
spending
on
them
more
than
double
what
is
done
by
men
with
twice
my
means
my
tastes
were
all
simple
and
were
not
specially
vicious
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
ever
made
any
one
unhappy
then
the
estate
became
richer
but
mountjoy
grew
more
and
more
expensive
i
began
to
find
that
with
all
my
economies
the
estate
could
not
keep
pace
with
him
so
as
to
allow
me
to
put
by
anything
for
augustus
then
i
had
to
bethink
myself
what
i
had
to
do
to
save
the
estate
from
those
rascals
you
took
peculiar
steps
i
am
a
man
who
does
take
peculiar
steps
another
would
have
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
in
my
state
of
health
and
have
allowed
two
dirty
jews
such
as
tyrrwhit
and
samuel
hart
to
have
revelled
in
the
wealth
of
tretton
i
am
not
going
to
allow
them
to
revel
tyrrwhit
knows
me
and
hart
will
have
to
know
me
they
could
not
keep
their
hands
to
themselves
till
the
breath
was
out
of
my
body
now
i
am
about
to
see
that
each
shall
have
his
own
shortly
and
the
estate
will
still
be
kept
in
the
family
for
augustus
scarborough
yes
alas
yes
but
that
is
not
my
doing
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
cause
to
be
dissatisfied
with
myself
but
i
can
not
but
own
that
i
am
unhappy
but
i
wished
you
to
understand
that
though
a
man
may
break
the
law
he
need
not
therefore
be
accounted
bad
and
though
he
may
have
views
of
his
own
as
to
religious
matters
he
need
not
be
an
atheist
i
have
made
efforts
on
behalf
of
others
in
which
i
have
allowed
no
outward
circumstances
to
control
me
now
i
think
i
do
feel
sleepy
chapter
xxii
harry
annesley
is
summoned
home
just
now
i
am
triumphant
harry
annesley
had
said
to
his
hostess
as
he
left
armitage
house
in
the
paragon
at
cheltenham
he
was
absolutely
triumphant
throwing
his
hat
up
into
the
air
in
the
abandonment
of
his
joy
for
he
was
not
a
man
to
have
conceived
so
well
of
his
own
parts
as
to
have
flattered
himself
that
the
girl
must
certainly
be
his
there
are
at
present
a
number
of
young
men
about
who
think
that
few
girls
are
worth
the
winning
but
that
any
girl
is
to
be
had
not
by
asking
which
would
be
troublesome
but
simply
by
looking
at
her
you
can
see
the
feeling
in
their
faces
they
are
for
the
most
part
small
in
stature
well
made
little
men
who
are
aware
that
they
have
something
to
be
proud
of
wearing
shining
little
hats
by
which
they
seem
to
add
more
than
a
cubit
to
their
stature
men
endowed
with
certain
gifts
of
personal
dignity
i
may
perhaps
call
it
though
the
word
rises
somewhat
too
high
they
look
as
though
they
would
be
able
to
say
a
clever
thing
but
their
spoken
thoughts
seldom
rise
above
a
small
acrid
sharpness
they
respect
no
one
above
all
not
their
elders
to
such
a
one
his
horse
comes
first
if
he
have
a
horse
then
a
dog
and
then
a
stick
and
after
that
the
mistress
of
his
affections
but
their
fault
is
not
altogether
of
their
own
making
it
is
the
girls
themselves
who
spoil
them
and
endure
their
inanity
because
of
that
assumed
look
of
superiority
which
to
the
eyes
of
the
outside
world
would
be
a
little
offensive
were
it
not
a
little
foolish
but
they
do
not
marry
often
whether
it
be
that
the
girls
know
better
at
last
or
that
they
themselves
do
not
see
sufficiently
clearly
their
future
dinners
who
can
say
they
are
for
the
most
part
younger
brothers
and
perhaps
have
discovered
the
best
way
of
getting
out
of
the
world
whatever
scraps
the
world
can
afford
them
harry
annesley
faults
were
altogether
of
another
kind
in
regard
to
this
young
woman
the
florence
whom
he
had
loved
he
had
been
now
his
feeling
of
glory
was
altogether
redundant
having
been
told
by
florence
that
she
was
devoted
to
him
he
walked
with
his
head
among
the
heavens
the
first
instinct
with
such
a
young
man
as
those
of
whom
i
have
spoken
teaches
him
the
moment
he
has
committed
himself
to
begin
to
consider
how
he
can
get
out
of
the
scrape
it
is
not
much
of
a
scrape
for
when
an
older
man
comes
this
way
a
man
verging
toward
baldness
with
a
good
professional
income
our
little
friend
is
forgotten
and
he
is
passed
by
without
a
word
but
harry
had
now
a
conviction
on
that
one
special
night
that
he
never
would
be
forgotten
and
never
would
forget
he
was
filled
at
once
with
an
unwonted
pride
all
the
world
was
now
at
his
feet
and
all
the
stars
were
open
to
him
he
had
begun
to
have
a
glimmering
of
what
it
was
that
augustus
scarborough
intended
to
do
but
the
intentions
of
augustus
scarborough
were
now
of
no
moment
to
him
he
was
clothed
in
a
panoply
of
armor
which
would
be
true
against
all
weapons
at
any
rate
on
that
night
and
during
the
next
day
this
feeling
remained
the
same
with
him
then
he
received
a
summons
from
his
mother
at
buston
his
mother
pressed
him
to
come
at
once
down
to
the
parsonage
your
uncle
has
been
with
your
father
and
has
said
terrible
things
about
you
as
you
know
my
brother
is
not
very
and
i
should
not
care
so
much
for
what
he
says
were
it
not
that
so
much
is
in
his
hands
i
can
not
understand
what
it
is
all
about
but
your
father
says
that
he
does
nothing
but
threaten
he
talks
of
putting
the
entail
on
one
side
entails
used
to
be
fixed
things
i
thought
but
since
what
old
scarborough
did
nobody
seems
to
regard
them
now
but
even
suppose
the
entail
does
remain
what
are
you
to
do
about
the
income
your
father
thinks
you
had
better
come
down
and
have
a
little
talk
about
the
matter
this
was
the
first
blow
received
since
the
moment
of
his
exaltation
harry
knew
very
well
that
the
entail
was
fixed
and
could
not
be
put
aside
by
prosper
though
scarborough
might
have
succeeded
with
his
entail
but
yet
he
was
aware
that
his
present
income
was
chiefly
dependent
on
his
uncle
to
be
reduced
to
live
on
his
fellowship
would
be
very
dreadful
and
that
income
such
as
it
was
depended
entirely
on
his
celibacy
and
he
had
too
as
he
was
well
aware
engendered
habits
of
idleness
during
the
last
two
years
the
mind
of
a
young
man
so
circumstanced
turns
always
first
to
the
bar
and
then
to
literature
at
the
bar
he
did
not
think
that
there
could
be
any
opening
for
him
in
the
first
place
it
was
late
to
begin
and
then
he
was
humble
enough
to
believe
of
himself
that
he
had
none
of
the
peculiar
gifts
necessary
for
a
judge
or
for
an
advocate
perhaps
the
knowledge
that
six
or
seven
years
of
preliminary
labor
would
be
necessary
was
somewhat
of
a
deterrent
the
rewards
of
literature
might
be
achieved
immediately
such
was
his
idea
but
he
had
another
idea
perhaps
as
erroneous
that
this
career
would
not
become
a
gentleman
who
intended
to
be
squire
of
buston
he
had
seen
two
or
three
men
decidedly
bohemian
in
their
modes
of
life
to
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
assimilate
himself
there
was
quaverdale
whom
he
had
known
intimately
at
john
and
who
was
on
the
press
quaverdale
had
quarrelled
absolutely
with
his
father
who
was
also
a
clergyman
and
having
been
thrown
altogether
on
his
own
resources
had
come
out
as
a
writer
for
coming
he
made
his
five
or
six
hundred
a
year
in
a
rattling
loose
uncertain
sort
of
fashion
and
was
so
thought
harry
annesley
the
dirtiest
man
of
his
acquaintance
he
did
not
believe
in
the
six
hundred
a
year
or
quaverdale
would
certainly
have
changed
his
shirt
more
frequently
and
would
sometimes
have
had
a
new
pair
of
trousers
he
was
very
amusing
very
happy
very
thoughtless
and
as
a
rule
altogether
impecunious
annesley
had
never
known
him
without
the
means
of
getting
a
good
dinner
but
those
means
did
not
rise
to
the
purchase
of
a
new
hat
putting
quaverdale
before
him
as
an
example
annesley
could
not
bring
himself
to
choose
literature
as
a
profession
thinking
of
all
this
when
he
received
his
mother
letter
he
assured
himself
that
florence
would
not
like
professional
literature
he
wrote
to
say
that
he
would
be
down
at
buston
in
five
days
time
it
does
not
become
a
son
who
is
a
fellow
of
a
college
and
the
heir
to
a
property
to
obey
his
parents
too
quickly
but
he
gave
up
the
intermediate
days
to
thinking
over
the
condition
which
bound
him
to
his
uncle
and
to
discussing
his
prospects
with
quaverdale
who
as
usual
was
remaining
in
town
doing
the
editor
work
for
coming
if
he
interfered
with
me
i
should
tell
him
to
go
to
bed
said
quaverdale
the
allusion
was
of
course
made
to
prosper
i
am
not
on
those
sort
of
terms
with
him
i
should
make
my
own
terms
and
then
let
him
do
his
worst
what
can
he
do
if
he
means
to
withdraw
his
beggarly
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
of
course
he
do
it
i
suppose
i
do
owe
him
something
in
the
way
of
respect
not
if
he
threatens
you
in
regard
to
money
what
does
it
come
to
that
you
are
to
cringe
at
his
heels
for
a
beggarly
allowance
which
he
has
been
pleased
to
bestow
upon
you
without
your
asking
well
my
dear
fellow
i
should
say
to
him
can
stop
it
the
moment
you
please
for
certain
objects
of
your
own
that
your
heir
might
live
in
the
world
after
a
certain
fashion
you
have
bestowed
it
it
has
been
mine
since
i
was
a
child
if
you
can
reconcile
it
to
your
conscience
to
discontinue
it
do
so
you
would
find
that
he
would
have
to
think
twice
about
it
he
will
stop
it
and
what
am
i
to
do
then
can
i
get
an
opening
on
any
of
these
papers
quaverdale
whistled
a
mode
of
receiving
the
overture
which
was
not
pleasing
to
annesley
i
do
suppose
that
anything
so
very
in
the
way
of
intellect
is
required
annesley
had
got
a
fellowship
whereas
quaverdale
had
done
nothing
at
the
university
could
you
make
a
pair
of
shoes
shoemakers
do
get
good
wages
what
do
you
mean
a
fellow
never
can
get
you
to
be
serious
for
two
minutes
together
i
never
was
more
serious
in
my
life
that
i
am
to
make
shoes
no
i
do
quite
think
that
i
do
suppose
you
can
make
them
have
first
to
learn
the
trade
and
show
that
you
were
an
adept
and
i
must
show
that
i
am
an
adept
before
i
can
write
for
coming
there
was
a
tone
of
sarcasm
in
this
which
was
not
lost
on
quaverdale
certainly
you
must
and
that
you
are
a
better
adept
than
i
who
have
got
the
place
or
some
other
unfortunate
who
will
have
to
be
put
out
of
his
berth
coming
only
requires
a
certain
number
of
course
there
are
many
newspapers
in
london
and
many
magazines
and
much
literary
work
going
you
may
get
your
share
of
it
but
you
have
got
to
begin
by
shoving
some
incompetent
fellow
out
and
in
order
to
be
able
to
begin
you
must
learn
the
trade
how
did
you
begin
just
in
that
way
while
you
were
roaming
about
london
like
a
fine
gentleman
i
began
by
earning
shillings
a
week
can
i
earn
shillings
a
week
you
wo
because
you
have
already
got
your
fellowship
you
had
a
knack
at
writing
greek
iambics
and
therefore
got
a
fellowship
i
picked
up
at
the
same
time
the
way
of
stringing
english
together
i
also
soon
learned
the
way
to
be
hungry
i
not
hungry
now
very
often
but
i
been
through
it
my
belief
is
that
you
would
get
along
with
my
editor
that
your
idea
of
being
independent
certainly
it
is
i
do
his
work
and
take
his
pay
and
obey
his
orders
if
you
think
you
can
do
the
same
come
and
try
there
not
room
here
but
there
is
no
doubt
room
elsewhere
there
the
trade
to
be
learned
like
any
other
trade
but
my
belief
is
that
even
then
you
could
not
do
it
we
do
want
greek
iambics
harry
turned
away
disgusted
quaverdale
was
like
the
rest
of
the
world
and
thought
that
a
peculiar
talent
and
a
peculiar
tact
were
needed
for
his
own
business
harry
believed
that
he
was
as
able
to
write
a
leading
article
at
any
rate
as
quaverdale
and
that
the
greek
iambics
would
not
stand
in
his
way
but
he
conceived
it
to
be
probable
that
his
habits
of
cleanliness
might
do
so
and
gave
up
the
idea
for
the
present
he
thought
that
his
friend
should
have
welcomed
him
with
an
open
hand
into
the
realms
of
literature
and
perhaps
it
was
the
case
that
quaverdale
attributed
too
much
weight
to
the
knack
of
turning
readable
paragraphs
on
any
subject
at
any
moment
notice
but
what
should
he
do
down
at
buston
there
were
three
persons
there
with
whom
he
would
have
to
contend
his
father
his
mother
and
his
uncle
with
his
father
he
had
always
been
on
good
terms
but
had
still
been
subject
to
a
certain
amount
of
gentle
sarcasm
he
had
got
his
fellowship
and
his
allowance
and
so
had
been
lifted
above
his
authority
his
father
thoroughly
despised
his
and
looked
down
upon
him
as
an
absolute
ass
but
he
was
reticent
only
dropping
a
word
here
and
there
out
of
deference
perhaps
to
his
wife
and
from
a
feeling
lest
his
son
might
be
deficient
in
wise
courtesy
if
he
were
encouraged
to
laugh
at
his
benefactor
he
had
said
a
word
or
two
as
to
a
profession
when
harry
left
cambridge
but
the
word
or
two
had
come
to
nothing
in
those
days
the
uncle
had
altogether
ridiculed
the
idea
and
the
mother
fond
of
her
son
the
fellow
and
the
heir
had
altogether
opposed
the
notion
the
rector
himself
was
an
idle
man
a
man
who
read
a
little
and
understood
what
he
read
and
thought
a
little
and
understood
what
he
thought
but
who
took
no
trouble
about
anything
to
go
through
the
world
comfortably
with
a
rather
large
family
and
a
rather
small
income
was
the
extent
of
his
ambition
in
regard
to
his
eldest
son
he
had
begun
well
harry
had
been
educated
free
and
had
got
a
fellowship
he
had
never
cost
his
father
a
shilling
and
now
the
eldest
of
two
daughters
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
son
of
a
brewer
living
in
the
little
town
of
buntingford
this
also
was
a
piece
of
which
the
rector
accepted
with
a
thankful
heart
there
was
another
girl
also
pretty
and
then
a
third
girl
not
grown
up
and
the
two
boys
who
were
at
present
at
school
at
royston
thus
burdened
the
rev
annesley
went
through
the
world
with
as
jaunty
a
step
as
was
possible
making
but
little
of
his
troubles
but
anxious
to
make
as
much
as
he
could
of
his
advantages
of
these
the
position
of
harry
was
the
brightest
if
only
harry
would
be
careful
to
guard
it
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
find
an
income
for
harry
if
the
squire
stopped
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
annum
which
he
at
present
allowed
him
then
there
was
harry
mother
who
had
already
very
frequently
discounted
the
good
things
which
were
to
fall
to
harry
lot
she
was
a
dear
good
motherly
woman
all
whose
geese
were
certainly
counted
to
be
swans
and
of
all
swans
harry
was
the
whitest
whereas
in
purity
of
plumage
mary
the
eldest
daughter
who
had
won
the
affections
of
the
young
buntingford
brewer
was
the
next
that
harry
allowance
should
be
stopped
would
be
almost
as
great
a
misfortune
as
though
thoroughbung
were
to
break
his
neck
out
hunting
with
the
puckeridge
hounds
an
amusement
which
after
the
manner
of
brewers
he
was
much
in
the
habit
of
following
annesley
had
lived
at
buston
all
her
life
having
been
born
at
the
hall
she
was
an
excellent
mother
of
a
family
and
a
good
clergyman
wife
being
in
both
respects
more
painstaking
and
assiduous
than
her
husband
but
she
did
maintain
something
of
respect
for
her
brother
though
in
her
inmost
heart
she
knew
that
he
was
a
fool
but
to
have
been
born
squire
of
buston
was
something
and
to
have
reached
the
age
of
fifty
unmarried
so
as
to
leave
the
position
of
heir
open
to
her
own
son
was
more
to
such
a
one
a
great
deal
was
due
but
of
that
deal
harry
was
but
little
disposed
to
pay
any
part
he
must
be
talked
to
and
very
seriously
talked
to
and
if
possible
saved
from
the
sin
of
offending
his
uncle
a
terrible
idea
had
been
suggested
to
her
lately
by
her
husband
the
entail
might
be
made
altogether
inoperative
by
the
marriage
of
her
brother
it
was
a
fearful
notion
but
one
which
if
it
entered
into
her
brother
head
might
possibly
be
carried
out
no
one
before
had
ever
dreamed
of
anything
so
dangerous
to
the
annesley
interests
and
annesley
now
felt
that
by
due
submission
on
the
part
of
the
heir
it
might
be
avoided
but
the
squire
himself
was
the
foe
whom
harry
most
feared
he
quite
understood
that
he
would
be
required
to
be
submissive
and
even
if
he
were
willing
he
did
not
know
how
to
act
the
part
there
was
much
now
that
he
would
endure
for
the
sake
of
florence
if
prosper
demanded
that
after
dinner
he
should
hear
a
sermon
he
would
sit
and
hear
it
out
it
would
be
a
bore
but
might
be
endured
on
behalf
of
the
girl
whom
he
loved
but
he
much
feared
that
the
cause
of
his
uncle
displeasure
was
deeper
than
that
a
rumor
had
reached
him
that
his
uncle
had
declared
his
conduct
to
mountjoy
scarborough
to
have
been
abominable
he
had
heard
no
words
spoken
by
his
uncle
but
threats
had
reached
him
through
his
mother
and
also
through
his
uncle
man
of
business
he
certainly
would
go
down
to
buston
and
carry
himself
toward
his
uncle
with
what
outward
signs
of
respect
would
be
possible
but
if
his
uncle
accused
him
he
could
not
but
tell
his
uncle
that
he
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
of
which
he
was
talking
not
for
all
buston
could
he
admit
that
he
had
done
anything
mean
or
ignoble
florence
he
was
quite
sure
would
not
desire
it
florence
would
not
be
florence
were
she
to
desire
it
he
thought
that
he
could
trace
the
hands
or
rather
the
tongues
through
which
the
calumny
had
made
its
way
down
to
the
hall
he
would
at
once
go
to
the
hall
and
tell
his
uncle
all
the
facts
he
would
describe
the
gross
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
no
doubt
he
had
left
the
man
sprawling
upon
the
pavement
but
there
had
been
no
sign
that
the
man
had
been
dangerously
hurt
and
when
two
days
afterward
the
man
had
vanished
it
was
clear
that
he
could
not
have
vanished
without
legs
had
he
taken
himself
off
as
was
probable
then
why
need
harry
trouble
himself
as
to
his
vanishing
if
some
one
else
had
helped
him
in
escaping
as
was
also
probable
why
had
not
that
some
one
come
and
told
the
circumstances
when
all
the
inquiries
were
being
made
why
should
he
have
been
expected
to
speak
of
the
circumstances
of
such
an
encounter
which
could
not
have
been
told
but
to
captain
scarborough
infinite
disgrace
and
he
could
not
have
told
of
it
without
naming
florence
mountjoy
his
uncle
when
he
heard
the
truth
must
acknowledge
that
he
had
not
behaved
badly
and
yet
harry
as
he
turned
it
all
in
his
mind
was
uneasy
as
to
his
own
conduct
he
could
not
quite
acquit
himself
in
that
he
had
kept
secret
all
the
facts
of
that
midnight
encounter
in
the
face
of
the
inquiries
which
had
been
made
in
that
he
had
falsely
assured
augustus
scarborough
of
his
ignorance
and
yet
he
knew
that
on
no
consideration
would
he
acknowledge
himself
to
have
been
wrong
chapter
xxiii
the
rumors
as
to
prosper
it
was
still
october
when
harry
annesley
went
down
to
buston
and
the
mountjoys
had
just
reached
brussels
grey
had
made
his
visit
to
tretton
and
had
returned
to
london
harry
went
home
on
an
understanding
on
the
part
of
his
mother
at
any
rate
that
he
should
remain
there
till
christmas
but
he
felt
himself
very
averse
to
so
long
a
sojourn
if
the
hall
and
park
were
open
to
him
he
might
endure
it
he
would
take
down
two
or
three
stiff
books
which
he
certainly
would
never
read
and
would
shoot
a
few
pheasants
and
possibly
ride
one
of
his
future
horses
with
the
hounds
but
he
feared
that
there
was
to
be
a
quarrel
by
which
he
would
be
debarred
from
the
hall
and
the
park
and
he
knew
too
that
it
would
not
be
well
for
him
to
shoot
and
hunt
when
his
income
should
have
been
cut
off
it
would
be
necessary
that
some
great
step
should
be
taken
at
once
but
then
it
would
be
necessary
also
that
florence
should
agree
to
that
step
he
had
a
modest
lodging
in
london
but
before
he
started
he
prepared
himself
for
what
must
occur
by
giving
notice
i
do
say
as
yet
that
i
shall
give
them
up
but
i
might
as
well
let
you
know
that
it
possible
this
he
said
to
brown
who
kept
the
lodgings
and
who
received
this
intimation
as
a
brown
is
sure
to
do
but
where
should
he
betake
himself
when
his
home
at
brown
had
been
lost
he
would
he
thought
find
it
quite
impossible
to
live
in
absolute
idleness
at
the
rectory
then
in
an
unhappy
frame
of
mind
he
went
down
by
the
train
to
stevenage
and
was
there
met
by
the
rectory
he
saw
it
all
in
his
mother
eye
the
moment
she
embraced
him
there
was
some
terrible
trouble
in
the
wind
and
what
could
it
be
but
his
uncle
well
mother
what
is
it
oh
harry
there
is
such
a
sad
affair
up
at
the
hall
is
my
uncle
dead
dead
no
then
why
do
you
look
so
sad
such
a
man
so
faint
so
spiritless
so
dull
so
dead
in
look
so
drew
priam
curtain
in
the
dead
of
night
oh
harry
do
not
laugh
your
uncle
says
such
dreadful
things
i
do
care
much
what
he
says
the
question
is
what
does
he
mean
to
do
he
declares
that
he
will
cut
you
off
altogether
that
is
sooner
said
than
done
that
is
all
very
well
harry
but
he
can
do
it
oh
harry
but
come
and
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
i
told
your
father
to
be
out
so
that
i
might
have
you
alone
and
the
dear
girls
are
gone
into
buntingford
ah
like
them
thoroughbung
will
have
enough
of
them
he
is
our
only
happiness
now
poor
thoroughbung
i
pity
him
if
he
has
to
do
happiness
for
the
whole
household
joshua
is
a
most
excellent
young
man
where
we
should
be
without
him
i
do
not
know
the
flourishing
young
brewer
was
named
joshua
and
had
been
known
to
harry
for
some
years
though
never
as
yet
known
as
a
i
am
sure
he
is
particularly
as
he
has
chosen
molly
to
be
his
wife
he
is
just
the
young
man
who
ought
to
have
a
wife
of
course
he
ought
because
he
can
keep
a
family
but
now
about
my
uncle
he
is
to
perform
this
ceremony
of
cutting
me
off
will
he
turn
out
to
have
had
a
wife
and
family
in
former
ages
i
have
no
doubt
old
scarborough
could
manage
it
but
i
do
give
my
uncle
credit
for
so
much
cleverness
but
in
future
ages
said
the
unhappy
mother
shaking
her
head
and
rubbing
her
eyes
you
mean
that
he
is
going
to
have
a
family
it
is
all
in
the
hands
of
providence
said
the
parson
wife
yes
that
is
true
he
is
not
too
old
yet
to
be
a
second
priam
and
have
his
curtains
drawn
the
other
way
that
his
little
game
is
it
there
a
sort
of
rumor
about
that
it
is
possible
and
who
is
the
lady
you
may
be
sure
there
will
be
no
lack
of
a
lady
if
he
sets
his
mind
upon
it
i
was
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
and
i
thought
of
matilda
thoroughbung
joshua
aunt
well
she
is
joshua
aunt
no
doubt
i
did
just
whisper
the
idea
to
joshua
and
he
says
that
she
is
fool
enough
for
anything
she
has
thousand
pounds
of
her
own
but
she
lives
all
by
herself
i
know
where
she
lives
just
out
of
buntingford
as
you
go
to
royston
but
she
not
alone
is
uncle
prosper
to
marry
miss
tickle
also
miss
tickle
was
an
estimable
lady
living
as
companion
to
miss
thoroughbung
i
do
know
how
they
may
manage
but
it
has
to
be
thought
of
harry
we
only
know
that
your
uncle
has
been
twice
to
buntingford
the
lady
is
fifty
at
any
rate
the
lady
is
barely
forty
she
gives
out
that
she
is
and
he
could
settle
a
jointure
on
her
which
would
leave
the
property
not
worth
having
what
can
i
do
yes
indeed
my
dear
what
can
you
do
why
is
he
going
to
upset
all
the
arrangements
of
my
life
and
his
life
after
such
a
fashion
as
this
that
just
what
your
father
says
i
suppose
he
can
do
it
the
law
will
allow
him
but
the
injustice
would
be
monstrous
i
did
not
ask
him
to
take
me
by
the
hand
when
i
was
a
boy
and
lead
me
into
this
special
walk
of
life
it
has
been
his
own
doing
how
will
he
look
me
in
the
face
and
tell
me
that
he
is
going
to
marry
a
wife
i
shall
look
him
in
the
face
and
tell
him
of
my
wife
but
is
that
settled
yes
mother
it
is
settled
wish
me
joy
for
having
won
the
finest
lady
that
ever
walked
the
earth
his
mother
blessed
him
but
said
nothing
about
the
finest
lady
who
at
that
moment
she
believed
to
be
the
future
bride
of
joshua
thoroughbung
and
when
i
shall
tell
my
uncle
that
it
is
so
what
will
he
say
to
me
will
he
have
the
face
then
to
tell
me
that
i
am
to
be
cut
out
of
buston
i
doubt
whether
he
will
have
the
courage
he
has
thought
of
that
harry
how
thought
of
it
mother
he
has
given
orders
that
he
is
not
to
see
you
not
to
see
me
so
he
declares
he
has
written
a
long
letter
to
your
father
in
which
he
says
that
he
would
be
spared
the
agony
of
an
interview
what
is
it
all
done
then
your
father
got
the
letter
yesterday
it
must
have
taken
my
poor
brother
a
week
to
write
it
and
he
tells
the
whole
plan
matilda
thoroughbung
and
the
future
family
no
he
does
not
say
anything
about
miss
thoroughbung
he
says
that
he
must
make
other
arrangements
about
the
property
he
ca
make
other
arrangements
that
is
not
until
the
boy
is
born
it
may
be
a
long
time
first
you
know
but
the
jointure
what
does
molly
say
about
it
molly
is
mad
about
it
and
so
is
joshua
joshua
talks
about
it
just
as
though
he
were
one
of
us
and
he
says
that
the
old
people
at
buntingford
would
not
hear
of
it
the
old
people
spoken
of
were
the
father
and
mother
of
joshua
and
the
of
miss
matilda
thoroughbung
but
what
can
they
do
they
can
do
nothing
if
miss
matilda
likes
uncle
prosper
likes
my
dear
how
young
you
are
of
course
she
would
like
a
country
house
to
live
in
and
the
park
and
the
county
society
and
she
would
like
somebody
to
live
with
besides
miss
tickle
my
uncle
for
instance
yes
your
uncle
if
i
had
my
choice
mother
i
should
prefer
miss
tickle
because
you
are
a
silly
boy
but
what
are
you
to
do
now
in
this
long
letter
which
he
has
written
to
my
father
does
he
give
no
reason
your
father
will
show
you
the
letter
of
course
he
gives
reasons
he
says
that
you
have
done
something
which
you
ought
not
to
have
done
about
that
wretched
mountjoy
scarborough
what
does
he
know
about
it
the
idiot
oh
harry
well
mother
what
better
can
i
say
of
him
he
has
taken
me
as
a
child
and
fashioned
my
life
for
me
has
said
that
this
property
should
be
mine
and
has
put
an
income
into
my
hand
as
though
i
were
an
eldest
son
has
repeatedly
declared
when
his
voice
was
more
potent
than
mine
that
i
should
follow
no
profession
he
has
bound
himself
to
me
telling
all
the
world
that
i
was
his
heir
and
now
he
casts
me
out
because
he
has
heard
some
story
of
the
truth
of
which
he
knows
nothing
what
better
can
i
say
of
him
than
call
him
an
idiot
he
must
be
that
or
else
a
heartless
knave
and
he
says
that
he
does
not
mean
to
see
me
me
with
whose
life
he
has
thus
been
empowered
to
interfere
so
as
to
blast
it
if
not
to
bless
it
and
intends
to
turn
me
adrift
as
he
might
do
a
dog
that
did
not
suit
him
and
because
he
knows
that
he
can
not
answer
me
he
declares
that
he
will
not
see
me
it
is
very
hard
harry
therefore
i
call
him
an
idiot
in
preference
to
calling
him
a
knave
but
i
am
not
going
to
be
dropped
out
of
the
running
in
that
way
just
in
deference
to
his
will
i
shall
see
him
unless
they
lock
him
up
in
his
bedroom
i
shall
compel
him
to
see
me
what
good
would
that
do
harry
that
would
only
set
him
more
against
you
you
do
know
his
weakness
oh
yes
i
do
he
is
very
weak
he
will
not
see
me
because
he
will
have
to
yield
when
he
hears
what
i
have
to
say
for
myself
he
knows
that
and
would
therefore
fain
keep
away
from
me
why
should
he
be
stirred
to
this
animosity
against
me
why
indeed
because
there
is
some
one
who
wishes
to
injure
me
more
strong
than
he
is
and
who
has
got
hold
of
him
some
one
has
lied
behind
my
back
who
has
done
this
ah
that
is
the
question
but
i
know
who
has
done
it
though
i
will
not
name
him
just
now
this
enemy
of
mine
knowing
him
to
be
weak
knowing
him
to
be
an
idiot
has
got
hold
of
him
and
persuaded
him
he
believes
the
story
which
is
told
to
him
and
then
feels
happy
in
shaking
off
an
incubus
no
doubt
i
have
not
been
very
soft
with
him
nor
indeed
hard
i
have
kept
out
of
his
way
and
he
is
willing
to
resent
it
but
he
is
afraid
to
face
me
and
tell
me
that
it
is
so
here
are
the
girls
come
back
from
buntingford
molly
you
blooming
young
bride
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
brewer
he
none
the
worse
on
that
account
master
harry
said
the
eldest
sister
all
the
better
very
much
the
better
where
would
you
be
if
he
was
not
a
brewer
but
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
old
girl

have
known
him
ever
so
long
and

she
kissed
him

kate
i
wish

as
good
a
man
for
your
husband
said
harry
and
i
am
to
tell

continued
molly
who
was
now
in
high
that
there
will
be
always
one
of
his
horses
for
you
to
ride
as
long
as
you
remain
at
home
it
is
not
every
that
would
do
as
much
as
that
for
you
nor
yet
every
uncle
said
kate
shaking
her
head
from
which
harry
could
see
that
this
quarrel
with
his
uncle
had
been
freely
discussed
in
the
family
circle
uncles
are
very
different
said
the
mother
uncles
ca
be
expected
to
do
everything
as
though
they
were
in
love
fancy
uncle
peter
in
love
said
kate
prosper
was
called
uncle
peter
by
the
girls
though
always
in
a
sort
of
joke
then
the
other
two
girls
shook
their
heads
very
gravely
from
which
harry
learned
that
the
question
respecting
the
choice
of
miss
matilda
thoroughbung
as
a
mistress
for
the
hall
had
been
discussed
also
before
them
i
am
not
going
to
marry
all
the
family
said
molly
not
miss
matilda
for
instance
said
her
brother
laughing
no
especially
not
matilda
joshua
is
quite
as
angry
about
his
aunt
as
anybody
here
can
be
you
find
that
he
is
more
of
an
annesley
than
a
thoroughbung
my
dear
said
the
mother
your
husband
will
as
a
matter
of
course
think
most
of
his
own
family
and
so
ought
you
to
do
of
his
family
which
will
be
yours
a
married
woman
should
always
think
most
of
her
husband
family
in
this
way
the
mother
told
her
daughter
of
her
future
duties
but
behind
the
mother
back
kate
made
a
grimace
for
the
benefit
of
her
sister
fanny
showing
thereby
her
conviction
that
in
a
matter
of
blood
what
she
called
being
a
gentleman
a
thoroughbung
could
not
approach
an
annesley
mamma
does
not
know
it
as
yet
molly
said
afterward
in
privacy
to
her
brother
but
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
uncle
peter
has
been
into
buntingford
and
has
made
an
offer
to
aunt
matilda
i
could
tell
it
at
once
because
she
looked
so
sharp
at
me
and
joshua
says
that
he
is
sure
it
is
so
by
the
airs
she
gives
herself
you
think
she
have
him
have
him
of
course
she
have
him
why
should
she
a
wretched
old
maid
living
with
a
companion
like
that
would
have
any
one
she
has
got
a
lot
of
money
she
take
care
of
her
money
let
her
alone
for
that
and
she
have
his
house
to
live
in
and
there
be
a
jointure
of
course
if
there
were
to
be
children
oh
bother
well
perhaps
there
will
not
but
it
will
be
just
as
bad
we
do
mean
even
to
visit
them
we
think
it
so
very
wicked
and
we
shall
tell
them
a
bit
of
our
mind
as
soon
as
the
thing
has
been
publicly
declared
chapter
xxiv
harry
annesley
misery
the
conversation
which
took
place
that
evening
between
harry
and
his
father
was
more
serious
in
its
language
though
not
more
important
in
its
purpose
this
is
bad
news
harry
said
the
rector
yes
indeed
sir
your
uncle
no
doubt
can
do
as
he
pleases
you
mean
as
to
the
income
he
has
allowed
me
as
to
the
income
as
to
the
property
itself
it
is
bad
waiting
for
dead
men
shoes
and
yet
it
is
what
everybody
does
in
this
world
no
one
can
say
that
i
have
been
at
all
in
a
hurry
to
step
into
my
uncle
shoes
it
was
he
that
first
told
you
that
he
should
never
marry
and
as
the
property
had
been
entailed
on
me
he
undertook
to
bring
me
up
as
his
son
so
he
did
not
a
doubt
about
it
sir
but
i
had
nothing
to
say
to
it
as
far
as
i
understand
he
has
been
allowing
me
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
for
the
last
dozen
years
ever
since
you
went
to
the
at
that
time
i
could
not
be
expected
to
have
a
word
to
say
to
it
and
it
has
gone
on
ever
since
yes
it
has
gone
on
ever
since
and
when
i
was
leaving
cambridge
he
required
that
i
should
not
go
into
a
profession
not
exactly
that
harry
it
was
so
that
i
understood
it
he
did
not
wish
his
heir
to
be
burdened
with
a
profession
he
said
so
to
me
himself
yes
just
when
he
was
in
his
pride
because
you
had
got
your
fellowship
but
there
was
a
contract
understood
if
not
made
what
contract
asked
harry
with
an
air
of
surprise
that
you
should
be
to
him
as
a
son
i
never
undertook
it
i
would
have
done
it
at
the
price
or
for
any
price
i
never
felt
for
him
the
respect
or
the
love
that
were
due
to
a
father
i
did
feel
both
of
them
to
the
full
for
my
own
father
they
are
a
sort
of
a
thing
which
we
can
not
transfer
they
may
be
shared
harry
said
the
rector
who
was
flattered
no
sir
in
this
instance
that
was
not
possible
you
might
have
sat
by
while
he
read
a
sermon
to
his
sister
and
nieces
you
understood
his
vanity
and
you
wounded
it
knowing
what
you
were
doing
i
do
mean
to
blame
you
but
it
was
a
misfortune
now
we
must
look
it
in
the
face
and
see
what
must
be
done
your
mother
has
told
you
that
he
has
written
to
me
there
is
his
letter
you
will
see
that
he
writes
with
a
fixed
purpose
then
he
handed
to
harry
a
letter
written
on
a
large
sheet
of
paper
the
reading
of
which
would
be
so
long
that
harry
seated
himself
for
the
operation
the
letter
need
not
here
be
repeated
at
length
it
was
written
with
involved
sentences
but
in
very
decided
language
it
said
nothing
of
harry
want
of
duty
or
not
attending
to
the
sermons
or
of
other
deficiencies
of
a
like
nature
but
based
his
resolution
in
regard
to
stopping
the
income
on
his
nephew
misconduct
as
it
appeared
to
him
in
a
certain
particular
case
and
unfortunately
though
harry
was
prepared
to
deny
that
his
conduct
on
that
occasion
had
been
subject
to
censure
he
could
not
contradict
any
of
the
facts
on
which
prosper
had
founded
his
opinion
the
story
was
told
in
reference
to
mountjoy
scarborough
but
not
the
whole
story
i
understand
that
there
was
a
row
in
the
streets
late
at
night
at
the
end
of
which
young
scarborough
was
left
as
dead
under
the
railings
left
for
dead
exclaimed
harry
who
says
that
he
was
left
for
dead
i
did
not
think
him
to
be
dead
you
had
better
read
it
to
the
end
said
his
father
and
harry
read
it
the
letter
went
on
to
describe
how
mountjoy
scarborough
was
missed
from
his
usual
haunts
how
search
was
made
by
the
police
how
the
newspapers
were
filled
with
the
strange
incident
and
how
harry
had
told
nothing
of
what
had
occurred
but
beyond
this
the
letter
went
on
to
say
he
positively
denied
in
conversation
with
the
gentleman
brother
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
gentleman
on
the
night
in
question
if
this
be
so
he
absolutely
lied
a
man
who
would
lie
on
such
an
occasion
knowing
himself
to
have
been
guilty
of
having
beaten
the
man
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
probably
caused
his
death
for
he
had
left
him
for
dead
under
the
railings
in
a
london
street
and
in
the
midnight
hour
and
would
positively
assert
to
the
gentleman
brother
that
he
had
not
seen
the
gentleman
on
the
night
in
question
when
he
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
had
killed
him
a
deed
which
might
or
might
not
be
murder
is
not
fit
to
be
recognized
as
my
heir
there
were
other
sentences
equally
long
and
equally
complicated
in
all
of
which
prosper
strove
to
tell
the
story
with
tragic
effect
but
all
of
which
had
reference
to
the
same
transaction
he
said
nothing
as
to
the
ultimate
destination
of
the
property
nor
of
his
own
proposed
marriage
should
he
have
a
son
that
son
would
of
course
have
the
property
should
there
be
no
son
harry
must
have
it
even
though
his
conduct
might
have
been
ever
so
abominable
to
prevent
this
outrage
on
society
his
marriage
with
its
ordinary
results
would
be
the
only
step
of
that
he
need
say
nothing
but
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
would
not
be
paid
after
the
christmas
quarter
and
he
must
decline
for
the
future
the
honor
of
receiving
henry
annesley
at
the
hall
harry
when
he
had
read
it
all
began
to
storm
with
anger
the
man
as
he
truly
observed
had
grossly
insulted
him
prosper
had
called
him
a
liar
and
had
hinted
that
he
was
a
murderer
you
can
do
nothing
to
him
his
father
said
he
is
your
uncle
and
you
have
eaten
his
bread
i
ca
call
him
out
and
fight
him
you
must
let
it
alone
i
can
make
my
way
into
the
house
and
see
him
i
do
think
you
can
do
that
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
get
beyond
the
and
i
would
advise
you
to
abandon
all
such
ideas
what
can
you
say
to
him
it
is
false
what
is
false
though
in
essence
it
is
false
in
words
it
is
true
you
did
deny
that
you
had
seen
him
i
forget
what
passed
augustus
scarborough
endeavored
to
pump
me
about
his
brother
and
i
did
not
choose
to
be
pumped
as
far
as
i
can
ascertain
now
it
is
he
that
is
the
liar
he
saw
his
brother
after
the
affair
with
me
has
he
denied
it
practically
he
denies
it
by
asking
me
the
question
he
asked
me
with
the
ostensible
object
of
finding
out
what
had
become
of
his
brother
when
he
himself
knew
what
had
become
of
him
but
you
ca
prove
it
he
positively
says
that
you
did
deny
having
seen
him
on
the
night
in
question
i
am
not
speaking
of
augustus
scarborough
but
of
your
uncle
what
he
says
is
true
and
you
had
better
leave
him
alone
take
other
steps
for
driving
the
real
truth
into
his
brain
what
steps
can
be
taken
with
such
a
fool
write
your
own
account
of
the
transaction
so
that
he
shall
read
it
let
your
mother
have
it
i
suppose
he
will
see
your
mother
and
so
beg
his
favor
you
need
beg
for
nothing
or
if
the
marriage
comes
off
you
have
heard
of
the
marriage
sir
yes
i
have
heard
of
the
marriage
i
believe
that
he
contemplates
it
put
your
statement
of
what
did
occur
and
of
your
motives
into
the
hands
of
the
lady
friends
he
will
be
sure
to
read
it
what
good
will
that
do
no
good
but
that
of
making
him
ashamed
of
himself
you
have
got
to
read
the
world
a
little
more
deeply
than
you
have
hitherto
done
he
thinks
that
he
is
quarrelling
with
you
about
the
affair
in
london
but
it
is
in
truth
because
you
have
declined
to
hear
him
read
the
sermons
after
having
taken
his
money
then
it
is
he
that
is
the
liar
rather
than
i
i
who
am
a
moderate
man
would
say
that
neither
is
a
liar
you
did
not
choose
to
be
pumped
as
you
call
it
and
therefore
spoke
as
you
did
according
to
the
world
ways
that
was
fair
enough
he
who
is
sore
at
the
little
respect
you
have
paid
him
takes
any
ground
of
offence
rather
than
that
being
sore
at
heart
he
believes
anything
this
young
scarborough
in
some
way
gets
hold
of
him
and
makes
him
accept
this
story
if
you
had
sat
there
punctual
all
those
sunday
evenings
do
you
think
he
would
have
believed
it
then
and
i
have
got
to
pay
such
a
penalty
as
this
the
rector
could
only
shrug
his
shoulders
he
was
not
disposed
to
scold
his
son
it
was
not
the
custom
of
the
house
that
harry
should
be
scolded
he
was
a
fellow
of
his
college
and
the
heir
to
buston
and
was
therefore
considered
to
be
out
of
the
way
of
scolding
but
the
rector
felt
that
his
son
had
made
his
bed
and
must
now
lie
on
it
and
harry
was
aware
that
this
was
his
father
feeling
for
two
or
three
days
he
wandered
about
the
country
very
down
in
the
mouth
the
natural
state
of
ovation
in
which
the
girls
existed
was
in
itself
an
injury
to
him
how
could
he
join
them
in
their
ovation
he
who
had
suffered
so
much
it
seemed
to
be
heartless
that
they
should
smile
and
rejoice
when
he
the
head
of
the
family
as
he
had
been
taught
to
consider
himself
was
being
so
cruelly
for
a
day
or
two
he
hated
thoroughbung
though
thoroughbung
was
all
that
was
kind
to
him
he
congratulated
him
with
cold
congratulations
and
afterward
kept
out
of
his
way
remember
harry
that
up
to
christmas
you
can
always
have
one
of
the
nags
there
belladonna
and
orange
peel
i
think
you
find
the
mare
a
little
the
faster
though
perhaps
the
horse
is
the
bigger
jumper
oh
thank
you
said
harry
and
passed
on
now
thoroughbung
was
fond
of
his
horses
and
liked
to
have
them
talked
about
and
he
knew
that
harry
annesley
was
treating
him
badly
but
he
was
a
fellow
and
he
bore
it
without
complaint
he
did
not
even
say
a
cross
word
to
molly
molly
however
was
not
so
patient
you
might
be
a
little
more
gracious
when
he
doing
the
best
he
can
for
you
it
is
not
every
one
who
will
lend
you
a
horse
to
hunt
for
two
months
harry
shook
his
head
and
wandered
away
miserable
through
the
fields
and
would
not
in
these
days
even
set
his
foot
upon
the
soil
of
the
park
he
was
not
going
to
intrude
any
farther
he
said
to
the
rector
you
can
come
to
church
at
any
rate
his
father
said
for
he
certainly
will
not
be
there
while
you
are
at
the
parsonage
oh
yes
harry
would
go
to
the
church
i
have
yet
to
understand
that
prosper
is
owner
of
the
church
and
the
path
there
from
the
rectory
is
at
any
rate
open
to
the
public
for
at
buston
the
church
stands
on
one
corner
of
the
park
this
went
on
for
two
or
three
days
during
which
nothing
farther
was
said
by
the
family
as
to
harry
woes
a
letter
was
sent
off
to
brown
telling
her
that
the
lodgings
would
not
be
required
any
longer
and
anxious
ideas
began
to
crowd
themselves
on
harry
mind
as
to
his
future
residence
he
thought
that
he
must
go
back
to
cambridge
and
take
his
rooms
at
john
and
look
for
college
work
two
fatal
years
years
of
idleness
and
gayety
had
been
passed
but
still
he
thought
that
it
might
be
possible
what
else
was
there
open
for
him
and
then
as
he
roamed
about
the
fields
his
mind
naturally
ran
away
to
the
girl
he
loved
how
would
he
dare
again
to
look
florence
in
the
face
it
was
not
only
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
per
annum
that
was
gone
that
would
have
been
a
small
income
on
which
to
marry
and
he
had
never
taken
the
girl
own
money
into
account
he
had
rather
chosen
to
look
forward
to
the
position
as
squire
of
buston
and
to
take
it
for
granted
that
it
would
not
be
very
long
before
he
was
called
upon
to
fill
the
position
he
had
said
not
a
word
to
florence
about
money
but
it
was
thus
that
he
had
regarded
the
matter
now
the
existing
squire
was
going
to
marry
and
the
matter
could
not
so
be
regarded
any
longer
he
saw
half
a
dozen
little
prospers
occupying
half
a
dozen
little
cradles
and
a
whole
suite
of
nurseries
established
at
the
hall
the
name
of
prosper
would
be
fixed
at
buston
putting
it
altogether
beyond
his
reach
in
such
circumstances
would
it
not
be
reasonable
that
florence
should
expect
him
to
authorize
her
to
break
their
engagement
what
was
he
now
but
the
penniless
son
of
a
poor
clergyman
with
nothing
on
which
to
depend
but
a
miserable
stipend
which
must
cease
were
he
to
marry
he
knew
that
he
ought
to
give
her
back
her
troth
and
yet
as
he
thought
of
doing
so
he
was
indignant
with
her
was
love
to
come
to
this
was
her
regard
for
him
to
be
counted
as
nothing
what
right
had
he
to
expect
that
she
should
be
different
from
any
other
girl
then
he
was
more
miserable
than
ever
as
he
told
himself
that
such
would
undoubtedly
be
her
conduct
as
he
walked
across
the
fields
heavy
with
the
mud
of
a
wet
october
day
there
came
down
a
storm
of
rain
which
wet
him
through
who
does
not
know
the
sort
of
sensation
which
falls
upon
a
man
when
he
feels
that
even
the
elements
have
turned
against
him
how
he
buttons
up
his
coat
and
bids
the
clouds
open
themselves
upon
his
devoted
bosom
blow
winds
and
crack
your
cheeks
rage
blow
you
cataracts
and
hurricanes
it
is
thus
that
a
man
is
apt
to
address
the
soft
rains
of
heaven
when
he
is
becoming
wet
through
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
and
on
the
present
occasion
harry
likened
himself
to
leer
it
was
to
him
as
though
the
steeples
were
to
be
drenched
and
the
cocks
drowned
when
he
found
himself
wet
through
in
this
condition
he
went
back
to
the
house
and
so
bitter
to
him
were
the
misfortunes
of
the
world
that
he
would
hardly
condescend
to
speak
while
enduring
them
but
when
he
had
entered
the
his
mother
greeted
him
with
a
letter
it
had
come
by
the
day
mail
and
his
mother
looked
into
his
face
piteously
as
she
gave
it
to
him
the
letter
was
from
brussels
and
she
could
guess
from
whom
it
had
come
it
might
be
a
sweetly
soft
but
then
it
might
be
neither
sweet
nor
soft
in
the
condition
of
things
in
which
harry
was
now
placed
he
took
it
and
looked
at
it
but
did
not
dare
to
open
it
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
without
a
word
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
then
tore
it
asunder
no
doubt
he
said
to
himself
it
would
allude
to
his
miserable
stipend
and
penniless
condition
the
letter
ran
as
follows
dearest
harry
i
think
it
right
to
write
to
you
though
mamma
does
not
approve
of
it
i
have
told
her
however
that
in
the
present
circumstances
i
am
bound
to
do
so
and
that
i
should
implore
you
not
to
answer
though
i
must
write
there
must
be
no
correspondence
between
us
rumors
have
been
received
here
very
detrimental
to
your
character
harry
gnashed
his
teeth
as
he
read
this
stories
are
told
about
your
meeting
with
captain
scarborough
in
london
which
i
know
to
be
only
in
part
true
mamma
says
that
because
of
them
i
ought
to
give
up
my
engagement
and
my
uncle
sir
magnus
has
taken
upon
himself
to
advise
me
to
do
so
i
have
told
them
both
that
that
which
is
said
of
you
is
in
part
untrue
but
whether
it
be
true
or
whether
it
be
false
i
will
never
give
up
my
engagement
unless
you
ask
me
to
do
so
they
tell
me
that
as
regards
your
pecuniary
prospects
you
are
ruined
i
say
that
you
can
not
be
ruined
as
long
as
you
have
my
income
it
will
not
be
much
but
it
will
i
should
think
be
enough
and
now
you
can
do
as
you
please
you
may
be
quite
sure
that
i
shall
be
true
to
you
through
ill
report
and
good
report
nothing
that
mamma
can
say
to
me
will
change
me
and
certainly
nothing
from
sir
magnus
and
now
there
need
not
be
a
word
from
you
if
you
mean
to
be
true
to
me
indeed
i
have
promised
that
there
shall
be
no
word
and
i
expect
you
to
keep
my
promise
for
me
if
you
wish
to
be
free
of
me
then
you
must
write
and
say
so
but
you
wo
wish
it
and
therefore
i
am
yours
always
always
always
your
own
florence
harry
read
the
letter
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
in
half
a
minute
he
had
torn
off
his
wet
coat
and
kicked
one
of
his
wet
boots
to
the
farther
corner
of
the
room
then
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
and
his
mother
entered
tell
me
harry
what
she
says
he
rushed
up
to
his
mother
all
damp
and
as
he
was
and
seized
her
in
his
arms
oh
mother
mother
what
is
it
dear
read
that
and
tell
me
whether
there
ever
was
a
finer
human
being
annesley
did
read
it
and
thought
that
her
own
daughter
molly
was
just
as
fine
a
creature
florence
was
simply
doing
what
any
girl
of
spirit
would
do
but
she
saw
that
her
son
was
as
jubilant
now
as
he
had
been
downcast
and
she
was
quite
willing
to
partake
of
his
comfort
not
write
a
word
to
her
ha
ha
i
think
i
see
myself
at
it
but
she
seems
to
be
in
earnest
there
in
earnest
and
so
am
i
in
earnest
would
it
be
possible
that
a
fellow
should
hold
his
hand
and
not
write
yes
my
girl
i
think
that
i
must
write
a
line
i
wonder
what
she
would
say
if
i
were
not
to
write
i
think
she
means
that
you
should
be
silent
she
has
taken
a
very
odd
way
of
assuming
it
i
am
to
keep
her
promise
for
her
my
darling
my
angel
my
life
but
i
can
not
do
that
one
thing
oh
mother
mother
if
you
knew
how
happy
i
am
what
the
mischief
does
it
all
signify
uncle
prosper
miss
thoroughbung
and
the
rest
of
it
with
a
girl
like
that
chapter
xxv
harry
and
his
uncle
harry
was
kissed
all
round
by
the
girls
and
was
congratulated
warmly
on
the
heavenly
excellence
of
his
mistress
they
could
afford
to
be
generous
if
he
would
be
of
course
you
must
write
to
her
said
molly
when
he
came
with
dry
clothes
i
should
think
so
mother
only
she
does
seem
to
be
so
much
in
earnest
about
it
said
annesley
i
think
she
would
rather
get
just
a
line
to
say
that
he
is
in
earnest
too
said
fanny
why
should
not
she
like
a
as
much
as
any
one
else
said
kate
who
had
her
own
ideas
of
course
she
has
to
tell
him
about
her
mamma
but
what
need
he
care
for
that
of
course
mamma
thinks
that
joshua
need
not
write
to
molly
but
molly
wo
mind
i
do
think
anything
of
the
kind
miss
and
besides
joshua
lives
in
the
next
parish
said
fanny
and
has
a
horse
to
ride
over
on
if
he
has
anything
to
say
at
any
rate
i
shall
write
said
harry
even
at
the
risk
of
making
her
angry
and
he
did
write
as
follows
buston
my
own
dear
girl
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
not
send
one
line
in
answer
put
yourself
in
my
place
and
consult
your
own
feelings
think
that
you
have
a
letter
so
full
of
love
so
noble
so
true
so
certain
to
fill
you
with
joy
and
then
say
whether
you
would
let
it
pass
without
a
word
of
acknowledgment
it
would
be
absolutely
impossible
it
is
not
very
probable
that
i
should
ask
you
to
break
your
engagement
which
in
the
midst
of
my
troubles
is
the
only
consolation
i
have
but
when
a
man
has
a
rock
to
stand
upon
like
that
he
does
not
want
anything
else
as
long
as
a
man
has
the
one
person
necessary
to
his
happiness
to
believe
in
him
he
can
put
up
with
the
ill
opinion
of
all
the
others
you
are
to
me
so
much
that
you
outweigh
all
the
world
i
did
not
choose
to
have
my
secret
pumped
out
of
me
by
augustus
scarborough
i
can
tell
you
the
whole
truth
now
mountjoy
scarborough
had
told
me
that
he
regarded
you
as
affianced
to
him
and
required
me
to
say
that
i
would
drop
you
you
know
now
how
probable
that
was
he
was
drunk
on
the
occasion
had
made
himself
purposely
drunk
so
as
to
get
over
all
scruples
and
attacked
me
with
his
stick
then
came
a
scrimmage
in
which
he
was
upset
a
sober
man
has
always
the
best
of
it
i
am
afraid
that
harry
put
in
that
little
word
sober
for
a
purpose
the
opportunity
of
declaring
that
he
was
sober
was
too
good
too
be
lost
i
went
away
and
left
him
certainly
not
dead
nor
apparently
much
hurt
but
if
i
told
all
this
to
augustus
scarborough
your
name
must
have
come
out
now
i
should
not
mind
now
i
might
tell
the
truth
about
you
with
great
pride
if
occasion
required
it
but
i
could
do
it
then
what
would
the
world
have
said
to
two
men
fighting
in
the
streets
about
a
girl
neither
of
whom
had
a
right
to
fight
about
her
that
was
the
reason
why
i
told
an
untruth
because
i
did
not
choose
to
fall
into
the
trap
which
augustus
scarborough
had
laid
for
me
if
your
mother
will
understand
it
all
i
do
not
think
she
will
object
to
me
on
that
score
if
she
does
quarrel
with
me
she
will
only
be
fighting
the
scarborough
game
in
which
i
am
bound
to
oppose
her
i
am
afraid
the
fact
is
that
she
prefers
the
scarborough
game
not
because
of
my
sins
but
from
auld
lang
syne
but
augustus
has
got
hold
of
my
uncle
prosper
and
has
done
me
a
terrible
injury
my
uncle
is
a
weak
man
and
has
been
predisposed
against
me
from
other
circumstances
he
thinks
that
i
have
neglected
him
and
is
willing
to
believe
anything
against
me
he
has
stopped
my
income
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
and
is
going
to
revenge
himself
on
me
by
marrying
a
wife
it
is
too
absurd
and
the
proposed
wife
is
aunt
of
the
man
whom
my
sister
is
going
to
marry
it
makes
such
a
heap
of
confusion
of
course
if
he
becomes
the
father
of
a
family
i
shall
be
nowhere
had
i
not
better
take
to
some
profession
only
what
shall
i
take
to
it
is
almost
too
late
for
the
bar
i
must
see
you
and
talk
over
it
all
you
have
commanded
me
not
to
write
and
now
there
is
a
long
letter
it
is
as
well
to
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
but
when
a
man
character
is
at
stake
he
feels
that
he
must
plead
for
it
you
wo
be
angry
with
me
because
i
have
not
done
all
that
you
told
me
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
tell
you
that
i
did
not
mean
to
ask
you
to
break
your
engagement
and
one
word
has
led
to
all
the
others
there
shall
be
only
one
other
which
means
more
than
all
the
rest
that
i
am
yours
dearest
with
all
my
heart
harry
annesley
there
he
said
to
himself
as
he
put
the
letter
into
the
envelope
she
may
think
it
too
long
but
i
am
sure
she
would
not
have
been
pleased
had
i
not
written
at
all
that
afternoon
joshua
was
at
the
rectory
having
just
trotted
over
after
business
hours
at
the
brewery
because
of
some
special
word
which
had
to
be
whispered
to
molly
and
harry
put
himself
in
his
way
as
he
went
out
to
get
on
his
horse
in
the
joshua
he
said
i
know
that
i
owe
you
an
apology
what
for
you
have
been
awfully
good
to
me
about
the
horses
and
i
have
been
very
ungracious
not
at
all
but
i
have
the
truth
is
i
have
been
made
thoroughly
miserable
by
circumstances
and
when
that
occurs
a
man
can
not
pick
himself
up
all
at
once
it
is
my
uncle
that
has
made
me
wretched
that
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
has
to
put
up
with
and
i
think
that
i
can
bear
it
as
well
as
another
but
an
attack
has
been
made
upon
me
which
has
wounded
me
i
know
all
about
it
i
do
mind
telling
you
as
you
and
molly
are
going
to
hit
it
off
together
there
is
a
girl
i
love
and
they
have
tried
to
interfere
with
her
they
have
succeeded
no
by
george
and
now
i
as
right
as
a
trivet
when
it
came
across
me
that
she
might
have
might
have
yielded
you
know
it
was
as
though
all
had
been
over
i
ought
not
to
have
suspected
her
but
she
all
right
indeed
she
is
i
think
you
like
her
when
you
see
her
some
day
if
you
do
you
have
the
most
extraordinary
taste
i
ever
knew
a
man
to
possess
how
about
the
horse
i
have
four
you
know
what
a
grand
thing
it
is
to
be
a
brewer
and
there
are
two
of
them
will
carry
you
the
other
two
are
not
quite
up
to
your
weight
you
have
been
out
yet
well
no
not
exactly
out
the
governor
is
the
best
fellow
in
the
world
but
he
draws
the
line
at
he
says
the
business
should
be
the
business
till
november
upon
my
word
i
think
he
right
and
how
many
days
a
week
after
that
well
three
regular
i
do
get
an
odd
day
with
the
essex
sometimes
and
the
governor
winks
the
governor
hunts
himself
as
often
as
you
oh
dear
no
three
a
week
does
for
the
governor
and
he
is
beginning
to
like
frosty
weather
and
to
hear
with
pleasure
that
one
of
the
old
horses
is
as
fit
as
he
should
be
he
what
they
call
training
off
old
fellow
mind
you
come
out
on
the
of
november
but
harry
though
he
had
been
made
happy
by
the
letter
from
florence
had
still
a
great
many
troubles
on
his
mind
his
first
trouble
was
the
having
to
do
something
in
reference
to
his
uncle
it
did
not
appear
to
him
to
be
proper
to
accept
his
uncle
decision
in
regard
to
his
income
without
at
any
rate
attempting
to
see
prosper
it
would
be
as
though
he
had
taken
what
was
done
as
a
matter
of
course
as
though
his
uncle
could
stop
the
income
without
leaving
him
any
ground
of
complaint
of
the
intended
marriage
if
it
were
intended
he
would
say
nothing
his
uncle
had
never
promised
him
in
so
many
words
not
to
marry
and
there
would
be
he
thought
something
ignoble
in
his
asking
his
uncle
not
to
do
that
which
he
intended
to
do
himself
without
even
consulting
his
uncle
about
it
as
he
turned
it
all
over
in
his
mind
he
began
to
ask
himself
why
his
uncle
should
be
asked
to
do
anything
for
him
whereas
he
had
never
done
anything
for
his
uncle
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
the
heir
not
to
the
uncle
but
to
buston
and
had
gradually
been
taught
to
look
upon
buston
as
his
right
as
though
he
had
a
certain
defeasible
property
in
the
acres
he
now
began
to
perceive
that
there
was
no
such
thing
a
tacit
contract
had
been
made
on
his
behalf
and
he
had
declined
to
accept
his
share
of
the
contract
but
he
had
been
debarred
from
following
any
profession
by
his
uncle
promised
allowance
he
did
not
think
that
he
could
complain
to
his
uncle
about
the
proposed
marriage
but
he
did
think
that
he
could
ask
a
question
or
two
as
to
the
income
without
saying
a
word
to
any
of
his
own
family
he
walked
across
the
park
and
presented
himself
at
the
of
buston
hall
in
doing
so
he
would
not
go
upon
the
grass
he
had
told
his
father
that
he
would
not
enter
the
park
and
therefore
kept
himself
to
the
road
and
he
had
dressed
himself
with
some
little
care
as
a
man
does
when
he
feels
that
he
is
going
forth
on
some
mission
of
importance
had
he
intended
to
call
on
old
thoroughbung
there
would
have
been
no
such
care
and
he
rung
at
the
instead
of
entering
the
house
by
any
of
the
numerous
side
inlets
with
which
he
was
well
acquainted
the
butler
understood
the
ring
and
put
on
his
when
he
answered
the
bell
is
my
uncle
at
home
matthew
he
said
prosper
harry
well
no
i
ca
say
that
he
just
is
and
the
old
man
groaned
and
wheezed
and
looked
unhappy
he
is
not
often
out
at
this
time
matthew
groaned
again
and
wheezed
more
deeply
and
looked
unhappier
i
suppose
you
mean
to
say
that
he
has
given
orders
that
i
am
not
to
be
admitted
to
this
the
butler
made
no
answer
but
only
looked
woefully
into
the
young
man
face
what
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
matthew
oh
harry
you
should
ask
me
as
is
merely
a
servant
harry
felt
the
truth
of
this
rebuke
but
was
not
going
to
put
up
with
it
that
all
my
eye
matthew
you
know
all
about
it
as
well
as
any
one
it
is
so
he
does
not
want
to
see
me
i
do
think
he
does
mr
harry
and
why
not
you
know
the
whole
of
my
family
story
as
well
as
my
father
does
or
my
uncle
why
does
he
shut
his
doors
against
me
and
send
me
word
that
he
does
not
want
to
see
me
well
harry
i
not
just
able
to
say
why
he
does
it
and
you
the
heir
but
if
i
was
asked
i
should
make
answer
that
it
has
come
along
of
them
sermons
then
matthew
looked
very
serious
and
bathed
his
head
i
suppose
so
that
was
it
harry
we
none
of
us
were
very
fond
of
the
sermons
i
dare
say
not
we
in
the
kitchen
but
we
was
bound
to
have
them
or
we
should
have
lost
our
places
and
now
i
must
lose
my
place
the
butler
said
nothing
but
his
face
assented
a
little
hard
is
it
matthew
but
i
wish
to
say
a
few
words
to
my
uncle
not
to
express
any
regret
about
the
sermons
but
to
ask
what
it
is
that
he
intends
to
do
here
matthew
shook
his
head
very
slowly
he
has
given
positive
orders
that
i
shall
not
be
admitted
it
must
be
over
my
dead
body
harry
and
he
stood
in
the
way
with
the
door
in
his
hand
as
though
intending
to
sacrifice
himself
should
he
be
called
upon
to
do
so
by
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
harry
however
did
not
put
him
to
the
test
but
bidding
him
with
some
little
joke
as
to
his
fidelity
made
his
way
back
to
the
parsonage
that
night
before
he
went
to
bed
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
uncle
as
to
which
he
said
not
a
word
to
either
his
father
or
mother
or
sisters
he
thought
that
the
letter
was
a
good
letter
and
would
have
been
proud
to
show
it
but
he
feared
that
either
his
father
or
mother
would
advise
him
not
to
send
it
and
he
was
ashamed
to
read
it
to
molly
he
therefore
sent
the
letter
across
the
park
the
next
morning
by
the
gardener
the
letter
was
as
follows
my
dear
uncle
my
father
has
shown
me
your
letter
to
him
and
of
course
i
feel
it
incumbent
on
me
to
take
some
notice
of
it
not
wishing
to
trouble
you
with
a
letter
i
called
this
morning
but
i
was
told
by
matthew
that
you
would
not
see
me
as
you
have
expressed
yourself
to
my
father
very
severely
as
to
my
conduct
i
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
i
ought
not
to
let
the
matter
pass
by
without
making
my
own
defence
you
say
that
there
was
a
row
in
the
streets
between
mountjoy
scarborough
and
myself
in
which
he
was
for
dead
when
i
left
him
i
did
not
think
he
had
been
much
hurt
nor
have
i
had
reason
to
think
so
since
he
had
attacked
me
and
i
had
simply
defended
myself
he
had
come
upon
me
by
surprise
and
when
i
had
shaken
him
off
i
went
away
then
in
a
day
or
two
he
had
disappeared
had
he
been
killed
or
much
hurt
the
world
would
have
heard
of
it
but
the
world
simply
heard
that
he
had
disappeared
which
could
hardly
have
been
the
case
had
he
been
much
hurt
then
you
say
that
i
denied
in
conversation
with
augustus
scarborough
that
i
had
seen
his
brother
on
the
night
in
question
i
did
deny
it
augustus
scarborough
who
was
evidently
well
acquainted
with
the
whole
transaction
and
who
had
i
believe
assisted
his
brother
in
disappearing
wished
to
learn
from
me
what
i
had
done
and
to
hide
what
he
had
done
he
wished
to
saddle
me
with
the
disgrace
of
his
departure
and
i
did
not
choose
to
fall
into
his
trap
at
the
moment
of
his
asking
me
he
knew
that
his
brother
was
safe
i
think
that
the
word
as
used
by
you
is
very
severe
for
such
an
occurrence
a
man
is
not
generally
held
to
be
bound
to
tell
everything
respecting
himself
to
the
first
person
that
shall
ask
him
if
you
will
ask
any
man
who
knows
the
world
my
father
for
instance
i
think
you
will
be
told
that
such
conduct
was
not
faulty
but
it
is
at
any
rate
necessary
that
i
should
ask
you
what
you
intend
to
do
in
reference
to
my
future
life
i
am
told
that
you
intend
to
stop
the
income
which
i
have
hitherto
received
will
this
be
considerate
on
your
part
in
his
first
copy
of
the
letter
harry
had
asked
whether
it
would
be
fair
and
had
then
changed
the
word
for
one
that
was
milder
when
i
took
my
degree
you
yourself
said
that
it
would
not
be
necessary
that
i
should
go
into
any
profession
because
you
would
allow
me
an
income
and
would
then
provide
for
me
i
took
your
advice
in
opposition
to
my
father
because
it
seemed
then
that
i
was
to
depend
on
you
rather
than
on
him
you
can
not
deny
that
i
shall
have
been
treated
hardly
if
i
now
be
turned
loose
upon
the
world
i
shall
be
happy
to
come
and
see
you
if
you
shall
wish
it
so
as
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
writing
to
me
your
affectionate
nephew
henry
annesley
harry
might
have
been
sure
that
his
uncle
would
not
see
him
probably
was
sure
when
he
added
the
last
paragraph
prosper
enjoyed
greatly
two
things
the
mysticism
of
being
invisible
and
the
opportunity
of
writing
a
letter
prosper
had
not
a
large
correspondence
but
it
was
laborious
and
as
he
thought
effective
he
believed
that
he
did
know
how
to
write
a
letter
and
he
went
about
it
with
a
will
it
was
not
probable
that
he
would
make
himself
common
by
seeing
his
nephew
on
such
an
occasion
or
that
he
would
omit
the
opportunity
of
spending
an
entire
morning
with
pen
and
ink
the
result
was
very
short
but
to
his
idea
it
was
satisfactory
sir
he
began
he
considered
this
matter
very
deeply
but
as
the
entire
future
of
his
own
life
was
concerned
in
it
he
felt
that
it
became
him
to
be
both
grave
and
severe
i
have
received
your
letter
and
have
read
it
with
attention
i
observe
that
you
admit
that
you
told
augustus
scarborough
a
deliberate
untruth
this
is
what
the
world
when
it
wishes
to
be
understood
as
using
the
unadorned
english
language
which
is
always
the
language
which
i
prefer
myself
calls
a
lie
a
lie
i
do
not
choose
that
this
humble
property
shall
fall
at
my
death
into
the
hands
of
a
liar
therefore
i
shall
take
steps
to
prevent
it
which
may
or
may
not
be
successful
as
such
steps
whatever
may
be
their
result
are
to
be
taken
the
income
intended
to
prepare
you
for
another
alternative
which
may
possibly
not
now
be
will
naturally
now
be
no
longer
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
peter
prosper
the
first
effect
of
the
letter
was
to
produce
laughter
at
the
rectory
harry
could
not
but
show
it
to
his
father
and
in
an
hour
or
two
it
became
known
to
his
mother
and
sister
and
under
an
oath
of
secrecy
to
joshua
thoroughbung
it
could
not
be
matter
of
laughter
when
the
future
hopes
of
miss
matilda
thoroughbung
were
taken
into
consideration
i
declare
i
do
know
what
you
are
all
laughing
about
said
kate
except
that
uncle
peter
does
use
such
comical
phrases
but
annesley
though
the
most
woman
in
the
world
was
almost
angry
i
do
know
what
you
all
see
to
laugh
at
in
it
peter
has
in
his
hands
the
power
of
making
or
marring
harry
future
but
he
has
said
harry
or
he
may
have
said
the
rector
it
all
in
the
hands
of
the
almighty
said
annesley
who
felt
herself
bound
to
retire
from
the
room
and
to
take
her
daughter
with
her
but
when
they
were
alone
both
the
father
and
his
son
were
very
angry
i
have
done
with
him
forever
said
harry
let
come
what
may
i
will
never
see
him
or
speak
to
him
again
a
and
he
has
written
those
words
in
that
way
so
as
to
salve
his
own
conscience
for
the
injustice
he
is
doing
he
knows
that
i
am
not
a
liar
he
can
not
understand
what
a
liar
means
or
he
would
know
that
he
is
one
himself
a
man
seldom
has
such
knowledge
as
that
is
it
not
so
when
he
stigmatizes
me
in
this
way
merely
as
an
excuse
to
himself
he
wants
to
be
rid
of
me
probably
because
i
did
not
sit
and
hear
him
read
the
sermons
let
that
pass
i
may
have
been
wrong
in
that
and
he
may
be
justified
but
because
of
that
he
can
not
believe
really
that
i
have
been
a
liar
a
liar
in
such
a
determined
way
as
to
make
me
unfit
to
be
his
heir
he
is
a
fool
harry
that
is
the
worst
of
him
i
do
think
it
is
the
worst
you
can
not
have
worse
it
is
dreadful
to
have
to
depend
on
a
fool
to
have
to
trust
to
a
man
who
can
not
tell
wrong
from
right
your
uncle
intends
to
be
a
good
man
if
it
were
brought
home
to
him
that
he
were
doing
a
wrong
he
would
not
do
it
he
would
not
rob
he
would
not
steal
he
must
not
commit
murder
and
the
rest
of
it
but
he
is
a
fool
and
he
does
not
know
when
he
is
doing
these
things
i
will
wash
my
hands
of
him
yes
and
he
will
wash
his
hands
of
you
you
do
not
know
him
as
i
do
he
has
taken
it
into
his
silly
head
that
you
are
the
chief
of
sinners
because
you
said
what
was
not
true
to
that
man
who
seems
really
to
be
the
sinner
and
nothing
will
eradicate
the
idea
he
will
go
and
marry
that
woman
because
he
thinks
that
in
that
way
he
can
best
carry
his
purpose
and
then
he
will
repent
at
leisure
i
used
to
tell
you
that
you
had
better
listen
to
the
sermons
and
now
i
must
pay
for
it
well
my
boy
it
is
no
good
crying
for
spilt
milk
as
i
was
saying
just
now
there
is
nothing
worse
than
a
fool
chapter
xxvi
marmaduke
lodge
on
the
of
next
month
two
things
occurred
each
of
great
importance
hunting
commenced
in
the
puckeridge
country
and
harry
with
that
famous
mare
belladonna
was
there
and
squire
prosper
was
driven
in
his
carriage
into
buntingford
and
made
his
offer
with
all
due
formality
to
miss
thoroughbung
the
whole
household
including
matthew
and
the
cook
and
the
coachman
and
the
boy
and
the
two
knew
what
he
was
going
to
do
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
how
they
knew
because
he
was
a
man
who
never
told
anything
he
was
the
last
man
in
england
who
on
such
a
matter
would
have
made
a
confidant
of
his
butler
he
never
spoke
to
a
servant
about
matters
unconnected
with
their
service
he
considered
that
to
do
so
would
be
altogether
against
his
dignity
nevertheless
when
he
ordered
his
carriage
which
he
did
not
do
very
frequently
at
this
time
of
the
year
when
the
horses
were
wanted
on
the
farm
and
of
which
he
gave
hours
notice
to
all
the
persons
concerned
and
when
early
in
the
morning
he
ordered
that
his
sunday
suit
should
be
prepared
for
wearing
and
when
his
aspect
grew
more
and
more
serious
as
the
hour
drew
nigh
it
was
well
understood
by
them
all
that
he
was
going
to
make
the
offer
that
day
he
was
both
proud
and
fearful
as
to
the
thing
to
be
done
proud
that
he
the
squire
of
buston
should
be
called
on
to
take
so
important
a
step
proud
by
anticipation
of
his
feelings
as
he
would
return
home
a
jolly
thriving
wooer
and
yet
a
little
fearful
lest
he
might
not
succeed
were
he
to
fail
the
failure
would
be
horrible
to
him
he
knew
that
every
man
and
woman
about
the
place
would
know
all
about
it
among
the
secrets
of
the
family
there
was
a
story
never
now
mentioned
of
his
having
done
the
same
thing
once
before
he
was
then
a
young
man
about
and
he
had
come
forth
to
lay
himself
and
buston
at
the
feet
of
a
baronet
daughter
who
lived
some
miles
off
she
was
very
beautiful
and
was
said
to
have
a
fitting
dower
but
he
had
come
back
and
had
shut
himself
up
in
the
house
for
a
week
afterward
to
no
human
ears
had
he
ever
since
spoken
of
his
interview
with
miss
courteney
the
doings
of
that
day
had
been
wrapped
in
impenetrable
darkness
but
all
buston
and
the
neighboring
parishes
had
known
that
miss
courteney
had
refused
him
since
that
day
he
had
never
gone
forth
again
on
such
a
mission
there
were
those
who
said
of
him
that
his
love
had
been
so
deep
and
enduring
that
he
had
never
got
the
better
of
it
miss
courteney
had
been
married
to
a
much
grander
lover
and
had
been
taken
off
to
splendid
circles
but
he
had
never
mentioned
her
name
that
story
of
his
abiding
love
was
throughly
believed
by
his
sister
who
used
to
tell
it
of
him
to
his
credit
when
at
the
rectory
the
rector
would
declare
him
to
be
a
fool
but
the
rector
used
to
say
that
he
was
dumb
from
pride
or
that
he
could
not
bear
to
have
it
known
that
he
had
failed
at
anything
at
any
rate
he
had
never
again
attempted
love
and
had
formally
declared
to
his
sister
that
as
he
did
not
intend
to
marry
harry
should
be
regarded
as
his
son
then
at
last
had
come
the
fellowship
and
he
had
been
proud
of
his
heir
thinking
that
in
some
way
he
had
won
the
fellowship
himself
as
he
had
paid
the
bills
but
now
all
was
altered
and
he
was
to
go
forth
to
his
wooing
again
there
had
been
a
rumor
about
the
country
that
he
was
already
accepted
but
such
was
not
the
case
he
had
fluttered
about
buntingford
thinking
of
it
but
he
had
never
put
the
question
to
his
thinking
it
would
not
have
been
becoming
to
do
so
without
some
ceremony
buston
was
not
to
be
made
away
during
the
turnings
of
a
quadrille
or
as
a
part
of
an
ordinary
conversation
it
was
not
probable
nay
it
was
impossible
that
he
should
mention
the
subject
to
any
one
but
still
he
must
visibly
prepare
for
it
and
i
think
that
he
was
aware
that
the
world
around
him
knew
what
he
was
about
and
the
thoroughbung
knew
and
miss
matilda
thoroughbung
knew
well
all
buntingford
knew
in
those
old
days
in
which
he
had
sought
the
hand
of
the
baronet
daughter
the
baronet
daughter
and
the
wife
and
the
baronet
himself
had
known
what
was
coming
though
prosper
thought
that
the
secret
dwelt
alone
in
his
own
bosom
nor
did
he
dream
now
that
harry
and
harry
father
and
harry
mother
and
sisters
had
all
laughed
at
the
conspicuous
gravity
of
his
threat
it
was
the
general
feeling
on
the
subject
which
made
the
rumor
current
that
the
deed
had
been
done
but
when
he
came
with
one
new
gray
on
and
the
other
dangling
in
his
hand
nothing
had
been
done
drive
to
buntingford
said
the
squire
yes
sir
said
matthew
the
door
of
the
carriage
in
his
hand
to
marmaduke
lodge
yes
sir
then
matthew
told
the
coachman
who
had
heard
the
instructions
very
plainly
and
knew
them
before
he
had
heard
them
the
squire
threw
himself
back
in
the
carriage
and
applied
himself
to
wondering
how
he
should
do
the
deed
he
had
in
truth
barely
studied
the
words
but
not
finally
the
manner
of
delivering
them
with
his
bare
hand
up
to
his
eyes
so
that
he
might
hold
the
glove
unsoiled
in
the
other
he
devoted
his
intellect
to
the
task
nor
did
he
withdraw
his
hand
till
the
carriage
turned
in
at
the
gate
the
drive
up
to
the
door
of
marmaduke
lodge
was
very
short
and
he
had
barely
time
to
arrange
his
waistcoat
and
his
whiskers
before
the
carriage
stood
still
he
was
soon
told
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
at
home
and
within
a
moment
he
found
himself
absolutely
standing
on
the
carpet
in
her
presence
report
had
dealt
unkindly
with
miss
thoroughbung
in
the
matter
of
her
age
report
always
does
deal
unkindly
with
unmarried
young
women
who
have
ceased
to
be
girls
there
is
an
idea
that
they
will
wish
to
make
themselves
out
to
be
younger
than
they
are
and
therefore
report
always
makes
them
older
she
had
been
called
and
even
fifty
her
exact
age
at
this
moment
was
and
as
prosper
was
only
fifty
there
was
no
discrepancy
in
the
marriage
he
would
have
been
for
his
age
but
for
an
air
of
ancient
dandyism
which
had
grown
upon
him
he
was
somewhat
dry
too
and
skinny
with
high
cheekbones
and
large
dull
eyes
but
he
was
clean
and
grave
and
orderly
a
man
promising
well
to
a
lady
on
the
lookout
for
a
husband
miss
thoroughbung
was
fat
fair
and
forty
to
the
letter
and
she
had
a
just
measure
of
her
own
good
looks
of
which
she
was
not
unconscious
but
she
was
specially
conscious
of
thousand
pounds
the
possession
of
which
had
hitherto
stood
in
the
way
of
her
search
after
a
husband
it
was
said
commonly
about
buntingford
that
she
looked
too
high
seeing
that
she
was
only
a
thoroughbung
and
had
no
more
than
thousand
pounds
but
miss
tickle
was
in
the
room
and
might
have
been
said
to
be
in
the
way
were
it
not
that
a
little
temporary
relief
was
felt
by
prosper
to
be
a
comfort
miss
tickle
was
at
any
rate
twenty
years
older
than
miss
thoroughbung
and
was
of
all
slaves
at
the
same
time
the
humblest
and
the
most
irritating
she
never
asked
for
anything
but
was
always
painting
the
picture
of
her
own
deserts
i
hope
i
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
tickle
quite
well
said
the
squire
as
soon
as
he
had
paid
his
first
compliments
to
the
lady
of
his
love
thank
you
prosper
pretty
well
my
anxiety
is
all
for
matilda
matilda
had
been
matilda
to
her
since
she
had
been
a
little
girl
and
miss
tickle
was
not
going
now
to
drop
the
advantage
which
the
old
intimacy
gave
her
i
trust
there
is
no
cause
for
it
well
i
not
so
sure
she
coughed
a
little
last
night
and
would
not
eat
her
supper
we
always
do
have
a
little
supper
a
despatched
crab
it
was
and
when
she
would
not
eat
it
i
knew
there
was
something
wrong
nonsense
what
a
fuss
you
make
well
prosper
have
you
seen
your
nephew
yet
no
miss
thoroughbung
nor
do
i
intend
to
see
him
the
young
man
has
disgraced
himself
dear
dear
how
sad
young
men
do
disgrace
themselves
i
fear
very
often
said
miss
tickle
we
wo
talk
about
it
if
you
please
because
it
is
a
family
affair
oh
no
said
miss
thoroughbung
at
least
not
as
yet
it
may
be
but
never
mind
i
would
not
wish
to
be
premature
in
anything
i
am
always
telling
matilda
so
she
is
so
impulsive
but
as
you
may
have
matters
of
business
prosper
on
which
to
speak
to
miss
thoroughbung
i
will
retire
it
is
very
thoughtful
on
your
part
miss
tickle
then
miss
tickle
retired
from
which
it
may
be
surmised
that
the
probable
circumstances
of
the
interview
had
been
already
discussed
between
the
ladies
prosper
drew
a
long
breath
and
sighed
audibly
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
with
the
object
of
his
affections
he
wondered
whether
men
were
ever
bright
and
jolly
in
such
circumstances
he
sighed
again
and
then
he
began
miss
thoroughbung
mr
prosper
all
the
prepared
words
had
flown
from
his
memory
he
could
not
even
bethink
himself
how
he
ought
to
begin
and
unfortunately
so
much
must
depend
upon
manner
but
the
property
was
unembarrassed
and
miss
thoroughbung
thought
it
probable
that
she
might
be
allowed
to
do
what
she
would
with
her
own
money
she
had
turned
it
all
over
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
she
was
quite
minded
to
accept
him
with
this
view
she
had
told
miss
tickle
to
leave
the
room
and
she
now
felt
that
she
was
bound
to
give
the
gentleman
what
help
might
be
in
her
power
oh
miss
thoroughbung
he
said
prosper
you
and
i
are
such
good
friends
that
that
that
yes
indeed
you
can
have
no
more
true
friend
than
i
am
not
even
miss
tickle
oh
bother
miss
tickle
miss
tickle
is
very
well
exactly
so
miss
tickle
is
very
well
a
most
estimable
person
we
leave
her
alone
just
at
present
yes
certainly
we
had
better
leave
her
alone
in
our
present
conversation
not
but
what
i
have
a
strong
regard
for
her
prosper
had
surely
not
thought
of
the
opening
he
might
be
giving
as
to
a
future
career
for
miss
tickle
by
such
an
assertion
so
have
i
for
the
matter
of
that
but
we
drop
her
just
now
then
she
paused
but
he
paused
also
you
have
come
over
to
buntingford
probably
in
order
that
you
might
congratulate
them
at
the
brewery
on
the
marriage
with
one
of
your
family
then
prosper
frowned
but
she
did
not
care
for
his
frowning
it
will
not
be
a
bad
match
for
the
young
lady
as
joshua
is
fairly
steady
and
the
brewery
is
worth
money
i
could
have
wished
him
a
better
said
the
lover
who
was
taken
away
from
the
consideration
of
his
love
by
the
allusion
to
the
annesleys
he
had
thought
of
all
that
and
in
the
dearth
of
fitting
objects
of
affection
had
resolved
to
endure
the
drawback
of
the
connection
but
it
had
for
a
while
weighed
very
seriously
with
him
so
that
had
the
thousand
pounds
been
twenty
thousand
pounds
he
might
have
taken
himself
to
miss
puffle
who
lived
near
saffron
walden
and
who
would
own
snickham
manor
when
her
father
died
the
property
was
said
to
be
involved
and
miss
puffle
was
certainly
as
an
heir
was
the
great
desideratum
he
had
resolved
that
matilda
thoroughbung
should
be
the
lady
in
spite
of
the
evils
attending
the
new
connection
he
did
feel
that
in
throwing
over
harry
he
would
have
to
abandon
all
the
annesleys
and
to
draw
a
line
between
himself
with
miss
thoroughbung
and
the
whole
family
of
the
thoroughbungs
generally
you
must
be
too
bitter
against
poor
molly
said
miss
thoroughbung
prosper
did
not
like
to
be
called
bitter
and
in
spite
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion
could
not
but
show
that
he
did
not
like
it
i
do
think
that
we
need
talk
about
it
oh
dear
no
kate
and
miss
tickle
need
neither
of
them
be
talked
about
prosper
disliked
all
familiarity
and
especially
that
of
being
laughed
at
but
miss
thoroughbung
did
laugh
so
he
drew
himself
up
and
dangled
his
glove
more
slowly
than
before
then
you
were
not
going
on
to
congratulate
them
at
the
brewery
certainly
not
i
did
not
know
my
purpose
carries
me
no
farther
than
marmaduke
lodge
i
have
no
desire
to
see
any
one
besides
miss
thoroughbung
that
is
a
compliment
then
his
memory
suddenly
brought
back
to
him
one
of
his
composed
sentences
in
beholding
miss
thoroughbung
i
behold
her
on
whom
i
hope
i
may
depend
for
all
the
future
happiness
of
my
life
he
did
feel
that
it
had
come
in
the
right
place
it
had
been
intended
to
be
said
immediately
after
her
acceptance
of
him
but
it
did
very
well
where
it
was
it
expressed
as
he
assured
himself
the
feelings
of
his
heart
and
must
draw
from
her
some
declaration
of
hers
goodness
gracious
me
mr
prosper
this
sort
of
coyness
was
to
have
been
expected
and
he
therefore
continued
with
another
portion
of
his
prepared
words
which
now
came
glibly
enough
to
him
but
it
was
a
previous
portion
it
was
all
the
same
to
miss
thoroughbung
as
it
declared
plainly
the
gentleman
intention
if
i
can
induce
you
to
listen
to
me
favorably
i
shall
say
of
myself
that
i
am
the
happiest
gentleman
in
hertfordshire
oh
mr
prosper
my
purpose
is
to
lay
at
your
feet
my
hand
my
heart
and
the
lands
of
buston
here
he
was
again
going
backward
but
it
did
not
much
matter
now
in
what
sequence
the
words
were
said
the
offer
had
been
thoroughly
completed
and
was
thoroughly
understood
a
lady
prosper
has
to
think
of
these
things
said
miss
thoroughbung
of
course
i
would
not
wish
to
hurry
you
prematurely
to
any
declaration
of
your
affections
but
there
are
other
considerations
prosper
you
know
about
my
property
nothing
particularly
it
has
not
been
a
matter
of
consideration
with
me
this
he
said
with
some
slight
air
of
offence
he
was
a
gentleman
whereas
miss
thoroughbung
was
hardly
a
lady
matter
of
consideration
her
money
of
course
had
been
how
should
he
not
consider
it
but
he
was
aware
that
he
ought
not
to
rush
on
that
subject
but
should
leave
it
to
the
arrangement
of
lawyers
expressing
his
own
views
through
her
own
lawyer
to
her
it
was
the
thing
of
most
importance
and
she
had
no
feelings
which
induced
her
to
be
silent
on
a
matter
so
near
to
her
she
rushed
but
it
has
to
be
considered
prosper
it
is
all
my
own
and
comes
to
very
nearly
one
thousand
a
year
i
think
it
is
nine
hundred
and
pounds
six
shillings
and
eightpence
of
course
when
there
is
so
much
money
it
would
have
to
be
tied
up
somehow
prosper
was
undoubtedly
disgusted
and
if
he
could
have
receded
at
this
moment
would
have
transferred
his
affections
to
miss
puffle
of
course
you
understand
that
she
had
not
accepted
him
as
yet
nor
said
a
word
of
her
regard
for
him
all
that
went
it
seemed
as
a
matter
of
no
importance
whatever
he
had
been
standing
for
the
last
few
minutes
and
now
he
remained
standing
and
looking
at
her
they
were
both
silent
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
speak
i
understand
that
between
a
lady
and
gentleman
so
circumstanced
there
should
be
a
settlement
just
so
i
also
have
some
property
said
prosper
with
a
touch
of
pride
in
his
tone
of
course
you
have
goodness
gracious
me
why
else
would
you
come
you
have
got
buston
which
i
suppose
is
two
thousand
a
year
at
any
rate
it
has
that
name
but
it
is
your
own
not
my
own
well
no
you
could
leave
it
to
your
widow
so
that
she
might
give
it
to
any
one
she
pleased
when
you
were
gone
here
the
gentleman
frowned
very
darkly
and
thought
that
after
all
miss
puffle
would
be
the
woman
for
him
all
that
has
to
be
considered
and
it
makes
buston
not
exactly
your
own
if
i
were
to
have
a
daughter
she
would
have
it
no
not
a
daughter
said
prosper
still
wondering
at
the
thorough
knowledge
of
the
business
in
hand
displayed
by
the
lady
oh
if
it
were
to
be
a
son
that
would
be
all
right
and
then
my
money
would
go
to
the
younger
children
divided
equally
between
the
boys
and
girls
prosper
shook
his
head
as
he
found
himself
suddenly
provided
with
so
plentiful
and
thriving
a
family
that
i
suppose
would
be
the
way
of
the
settlement
together
with
a
certain
income
out
of
buston
set
apart
for
my
use
it
ought
to
be
considered
that
i
should
have
to
provide
a
house
to
live
in
this
belongs
to
my
brother
and
i
pay
him
forty
pounds
a
year
for
it
it
should
be
something
better
than
this
my
dear
miss
thoroughbung
the
lawyer
would
do
all
that
there
did
come
upon
him
an
idea
that
she
with
her
aptitude
for
business
would
not
be
altogether
a
bad
helpmate
the
lawyers
are
very
well
but
in
a
transaction
of
this
kind
there
is
nothing
like
the
principals
understanding
each
other
young
women
are
always
robbed
when
their
money
is
left
altogether
to
the
gentlemen
robbed
do
suppose
i
mean
you
prosper
and
the
robbery
i
mean
is
not
considered
disgraceful
at
all
the
gentlemen
i
mean
are
the
fathers
and
the
brothers
and
the
uncles
and
the
lawyers
and
they
intend
to
do
right
after
the
custom
of
their
fathers
and
uncles
but
woman
rights
are
coming
up
i
hate
woman
rights
nevertheless
they
are
coming
up
a
young
woman
does
get
taken
in
as
she
used
to
do
i
do
mean
any
offence
you
know
this
was
said
in
reply
to
prosper
repeated
frown
since
woman
rights
have
come
up
a
young
woman
is
better
able
to
fight
her
own
battle
prosper
was
willing
to
admit
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
fair
but
she
was
fat
also
and
at
least
forty
there
was
hardly
need
that
she
should
refer
so
often
to
her
own
unprotected
youth
i
should
like
to
have
the
spending
of
my
own
income
prosper
that
a
fact
oh
indeed
yes
i
should
i
should
care
to
have
to
go
to
my
husband
if
i
wanted
to
buy
a
pair
of
stockings
an
allowance
i
should
say
and
that
should
be
my
own
income
nothing
to
go
to
the
house
oh
yes
there
might
be
certain
things
which
i
might
agree
to
pay
for
a
pair
of
ponies
i
should
like
i
always
keep
a
carriage
and
a
pair
of
horses
but
the
ponies
would
be
my
lookout
i
should
mind
paying
for
my
own
maid
and
the
champagne
and
my
clothes
of
course
and
the
bill
there
would
be
miss
tickle
too
you
said
you
would
like
miss
tickle
i
should
have
to
pay
for
her
that
would
be
about
enough
i
think
prosper
was
thoroughly
disgusted
but
when
he
left
marmaduke
lodge
he
had
not
said
a
word
as
to
withdrawing
from
his
offer
she
declared
that
she
would
put
her
terms
into
writing
and
give
them
to
her
lawyer
who
would
communicate
with
grey
prosper
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
knew
the
name
of
his
lawyer
who
was
in
truth
our
old
friend
and
then
while
he
was
still
hesitating
she
astounded
nay
shocked
him
by
her
mode
of
ending
the
conference
she
got
up
and
throwing
her
arms
round
his
neck
kissed
him
most
affectionately
after
that
there
was
no
retreating
for
prosper
no
immediate
mode
of
retreat
at
all
events
he
could
only
back
out
of
the
room
and
get
into
his
carriage
and
be
carried
home
as
quickly
as
possible
chapter
xxvii
the
proposal
it
had
never
happened
to
him
before
the
first
thought
that
came
upon
prosper
when
he
got
into
his
carriage
was
that
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
he
did
not
reflect
that
he
had
not
put
himself
in
the
way
of
it
but
now
the
strangeness
of
the
sensation
overwhelmed
him
he
inquired
of
himself
whether
it
was
pleasant
but
he
found
himself
compelled
to
answer
the
question
with
a
negative
it
should
have
come
from
him
but
not
yet
not
yet
probably
for
some
weeks
but
it
had
been
done
and
by
the
doing
of
it
she
had
sealed
him
utterly
as
her
own
there
was
no
getting
out
of
it
now
he
did
feel
that
he
ought
not
to
attempt
to
get
out
of
it
after
what
had
taken
place
he
was
not
sure
but
that
the
lady
had
planned
it
all
with
that
purpose
but
he
was
sure
that
a
strong
foundation
had
been
laid
for
a
breach
of
promise
case
if
he
were
to
attempt
to
escape
what
might
not
a
jury
do
against
him
giving
damages
out
of
the
acres
of
buston
hall
and
then
miss
thoroughbung
would
go
over
to
the
other
thoroughbungs
and
to
the
annesleys
and
his
condition
would
become
intolerable
in
some
moments
as
he
was
driven
home
he
was
not
sure
but
that
it
had
all
been
got
up
as
a
plot
against
him
by
the
annesleys
when
he
got
out
of
his
carriage
matthew
knew
that
things
had
gone
badly
with
his
master
but
he
could
not
conjecture
in
what
way
the
matter
had
been
fully
debated
in
the
kitchen
and
it
had
been
there
decided
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
certainly
to
be
brought
home
as
the
future
mistress
of
buston
the
step
to
be
taken
by
their
master
was
not
popular
in
the
buston
kitchen
it
had
been
there
considered
that
master
harry
was
to
be
the
future
master
and
by
some
perversity
of
intellect
they
had
all
thought
that
this
would
occur
soon
matthew
was
much
older
than
the
squire
who
was
hardly
to
be
called
a
sickly
man
and
yet
matthew
had
made
up
his
mind
that
harry
was
to
reign
over
him
as
squire
of
buston
when
therefore
the
tidings
came
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
to
brought
to
buston
as
the
mistress
there
had
been
some
slight
symptoms
of
rebellion
they
did
want
any
thoroughbung
there
they
had
their
own
idea
of
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
which
as
in
all
such
cases
was
perfectly
correct
they
knew
the
squire
to
be
a
fool
but
they
believed
him
to
be
a
gentleman
they
heard
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
a
clever
woman
but
they
did
not
believe
her
to
be
a
lady
matthew
had
said
a
few
words
to
the
cook
as
to
a
at
stevenage
she
had
told
him
not
to
be
an
old
fool
and
that
he
would
lose
his
money
but
she
had
thought
of
the
there
had
been
a
mutinous
feeling
matthew
helped
his
master
out
of
the
carriage
and
then
came
a
revulsion
that
froth
of
a
as
matthew
had
dared
to
call
her
had
absolutely
refused
his
master
prosper
went
into
the
house
very
meditative
and
sad
at
heart
it
was
a
matter
almost
of
regret
to
him
that
it
had
not
been
as
matthew
supposed
but
he
was
caught
and
bound
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
he
thought
of
all
the
particulars
of
her
proposed
mode
of
living
and
recapitulated
them
to
himself
a
pair
of
ponies
her
own
maid
champagne
the
bill
and
miss
tickle
miss
puffle
would
certainly
not
have
required
such
expensive
luxuries
champagne
and
the
fish
would
require
company
for
their
final
consumption
the
ponies
assumed
a
tone
of
being
quite
opposed
to
that
which
he
had
contemplated
he
questioned
with
himself
whether
he
would
like
miss
tickle
as
a
perpetual
inmate
he
had
in
sheer
civility
expressed
a
liking
for
miss
tickle
but
what
need
could
there
be
to
a
married
woman
of
a
miss
tickle
and
then
he
thought
of
the
education
of
the
five
or
six
children
which
she
had
almost
promised
him
he
had
suggested
to
himself
simply
an
heir
just
one
heir
so
that
the
nefarious
harry
might
be
cut
out
he
already
saw
that
he
would
not
be
enriched
to
the
extent
of
a
shilling
by
the
lady
income
then
there
would
be
all
the
trouble
and
the
disgrace
of
a
separate
purse
he
felt
that
there
would
be
disgrace
in
having
the
fish
and
champagne
which
were
consumed
in
his
own
house
paid
for
by
his
wife
without
reference
to
him
what
if
the
lady
had
a
partiality
for
champagne
he
knew
nothing
about
it
and
would
know
nothing
about
it
except
when
he
saw
it
in
her
heightened
color
despatched
crabs
for
supper
he
always
went
to
bed
at
ten
and
had
a
tumbler
of
brought
to
him
a
glass
of
with
just
a
squeeze
of
he
saw
ruin
before
him
no
doubt
she
was
a
good
manager
but
she
would
be
a
good
manager
for
herself
would
it
not
be
better
for
him
to
stand
the
action
for
breach
of
promise
and
betake
himself
to
miss
puffle
but
miss
puffle
was
fifty
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
lady
ought
to
be
younger
than
the
gentleman
he
was
much
distressed
in
mind
if
he
broke
off
with
miss
thoroughbung
ought
he
to
do
so
at
once
before
she
had
had
time
to
put
the
matter
into
the
hands
of
the
lawyer
and
on
what
plea
should
he
do
it
before
he
went
to
bed
that
night
he
did
draw
out
a
portion
of
a
letter
which
however
was
never
sent
my
dear
miss
thoroughbung
in
the
views
which
we
both
promulgated
this
morning
i
fear
that
there
was
some
essential
misunderstanding
as
to
the
mode
of
life
which
had
occurred
to
both
of
us
you
as
was
so
natural
at
your
age
and
with
your
charms
have
not
been
slow
to
anticipate
a
coming
period
of
uncheckered
delights
your
allusion
to
a
and
other
incidental
allusions
he
did
not
think
it
well
to
mention
more
particularly
the
fish
and
the
champagne
have
made
clear
the
sort
of
future
life
which
you
have
pictured
to
yourself
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
take
upon
myself
to
find
fault
with
anything
so
pleasant
and
so
innocent
but
my
prospects
of
life
are
different
and
in
seeking
the
honor
of
an
alliance
with
you
i
was
looking
for
a
quiet
companion
in
my
declining
years
and
it
might
be
also
to
a
mother
to
a
possible
future
son
when
you
honored
me
with
an
unmistakable
sign
of
your
affection
on
my
going
i
was
just
about
to
explain
all
this
you
must
excuse
me
if
my
mouth
was
then
stopped
by
the
mutual
ardor
of
our
feeling
i
was
about
to
say
but
he
had
found
it
difficult
to
explain
what
he
had
been
about
to
say
and
on
the
next
morning
when
the
time
for
writing
had
come
he
heard
news
which
detained
him
for
the
day
and
then
the
opportunity
was
gone
on
the
following
morning
when
matthew
appeared
at
his
bedside
with
his
cup
of
tea
at
nine
tidings
were
brought
him
he
took
in
the
buntingford
which
came
twice
a
week
and
as
matthew
laid
it
opened
and
unread
in
its
accustomed
place
he
gave
the
information
which
he
had
no
doubt
gotten
from
the
paper
you
have
heard
it
sir
i
suppose
as
yet
heard
what
about
miss
puffle
what
about
miss
puffle
i
have
heard
a
word
what
about
miss
puffle
he
had
been
thinking
that
moment
of
miss
puffle
of
how
she
would
be
superior
to
miss
thoroughbung
in
many
ways
so
that
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
holding
the
untasted
tea
in
his
hand
she
gone
off
with
young
farmer
tazlehurst
miss
puffle
gone
off
and
with
her
father
tenant
son
yes
indeed
sir
she
and
her
father
have
been
quarrelling
for
the
last
ten
years
and
now
she
off
she
was
always
riding
and
roistering
about
the
country
with
them
dogs
and
them
men
and
now
she
gone
oh
heavens
exclaimed
the
squire
thinking
of
his
own
escape
yes
indeed
sir
there
no
knowing
what
any
one
of
them
is
up
to
unless
they
gets
married
afore
they
thirty
or
at
most
they
most
sure
to
get
such
ideas
into
their
head
as
no
one
can
mostly
approve
this
had
been
intended
by
matthew
as
a
word
of
caution
to
his
master
but
had
really
the
opposite
effect
he
resolved
at
the
moment
that
the
latter
should
not
be
said
of
miss
thoroughbung
and
he
turned
matthew
out
of
the
room
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
how
dare
you
speak
in
that
way
of
your
betters
puffle
the
lady
father
has
for
many
years
been
my
friend
i
am
not
saying
anything
of
the
lady
nor
saying
that
she
has
done
right
of
course
in
the
servants
hall
you
can
say
what
you
please
but
up
here
in
my
presence
you
should
not
speak
in
such
language
of
a
lady
behind
whose
chair
you
may
be
called
upon
to
wait
very
well
sir
i
wo
no
more
said
matthew
retiring
with
mock
humility
but
he
had
shot
his
bolt
and
he
supposed
successfully
he
did
not
know
what
had
taken
place
between
his
master
and
miss
thoroughbung
but
he
did
think
that
his
speech
might
assist
in
preventing
a
repetition
of
the
offer
miss
puffle
gone
off
with
the
tenant
son
the
news
made
matrimony
doubly
dangerous
to
him
and
yet
robbed
him
of
the
chief
reason
by
which
he
was
to
have
been
driven
to
send
her
a
letter
he
could
not
at
any
rate
now
fall
back
upon
miss
puffle
and
he
thought
that
nothing
would
have
induced
miss
thoroughbung
to
go
off
with
one
of
the
carters
from
the
brewery
whatever
faults
she
might
have
they
did
not
lie
in
that
direction
champagne
and
ponies
were
as
faults
less
deleterious
miss
puffle
gone
off
with
young
tazlehurst
a
lady
of
fifty
with
a
young
man
of
and
she
the
reputed
heiress
of
snickham
manor
it
was
a
comfort
to
him
as
he
remembered
that
snickham
manor
had
been
bought
no
longer
ago
than
by
the
father
of
the
present
owner
the
prospers
been
at
buston
ever
since
the
time
of
george
the
first
you
can
not
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
he
had
been
ever
assuring
himself
of
that
fact
which
was
now
more
of
a
fact
than
ever
and
fifty
years
old
it
was
quite
shocking
with
a
steady
man
like
himself
and
with
the
approval
of
her
family
marriage
might
have
been
thought
of
but
this
young
tenant
son
who
was
in
no
respect
a
gentleman
whose
only
thought
was
of
galloping
over
hedges
and
ditches
such
an
idea
showed
a
state
of
mind
which
well
absolutely
disgusted
him
prosper
because
he
had
grown
old
himself
could
not
endure
to
think
that
others
at
his
age
should
retain
a
smack
of
their
youth
there
are
ladies
besides
miss
puffle
who
like
to
ride
across
the
country
with
a
young
man
before
them
or
perhaps
following
and
never
think
much
of
their
fifty
years
but
the
news
certainly
brought
to
him
a
great
change
of
feelings
so
that
the
letter
to
which
he
had
devoted
the
preceding
afternoon
was
put
back
into
the
and
was
never
finished
and
his
mind
immediately
recurred
to
miss
thoroughbung
and
he
bethought
himself
that
the
objection
which
he
felt
was
perhaps
in
part
frivolous
at
any
rate
she
was
a
better
woman
than
miss
puffle
she
certainly
would
run
after
no
farmer
son
though
she
might
be
fond
of
champagne
it
was
he
thought
chiefly
for
other
people
though
she
was
ambitious
of
ponies
the
ambition
might
be
checked
at
any
rate
she
could
pay
for
her
own
ponies
whereas
puffle
was
a
very
hale
old
man
of
seventy
puffle
he
told
himself
had
married
young
and
might
live
for
the
next
ten
years
or
twenty
to
prosper
whose
imagination
did
not
fly
far
afield
the
world
afforded
at
present
but
two
ladies
these
were
miss
puffle
and
miss
thoroughbung
and
as
miss
puffle
had
fallen
out
of
the
running
there
seemed
to
be
a
for
miss
thoroughbung
he
did
think
during
the
two
or
three
days
which
passed
without
any
farther
step
on
his
part
he
did
think
how
it
might
be
were
he
to
remain
unmarried
as
regarded
his
own
comfort
he
was
greatly
tempted
life
would
remain
so
easy
to
him
but
then
duty
demanded
of
him
that
he
should
marry
and
he
was
a
man
who
in
honest
sober
talk
thought
much
of
his
duty
he
was
absurdly
credulous
and
as
obstinate
as
a
mule
but
he
did
wish
to
do
what
was
right
he
had
been
convinced
that
harry
annesley
was
a
false
knave
and
had
been
made
to
swear
an
oath
that
harry
should
not
be
his
heir
harry
had
been
draped
in
the
blackest
colors
and
to
each
daub
of
black
something
darker
had
been
added
by
his
uncle
memory
of
those
neglected
sermons
it
was
now
his
first
duty
in
life
to
beget
an
heir
and
for
that
purpose
a
wife
must
be
had
putting
aside
the
ponies
and
the
champagne
and
the
despatched
crab
the
sound
of
which
as
coming
to
him
from
miss
tickle
mouth
was
uglier
than
the
other
sounds
he
still
thought
that
miss
thoroughbung
would
answer
his
purpose
from
her
side
there
would
not
be
making
of
a
silk
purse
but
then
the
boy
would
be
his
boy
as
well
as
hers
and
would
probably
take
more
after
the
father
he
passed
much
of
these
days
with
the
peerage
in
his
hand
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
best
blood
had
been
maintained
frequently
by
marriages
health
was
a
great
thing
health
in
the
mother
was
everything
who
could
be
more
healthy
than
miss
thoroughbung
then
he
thought
of
that
warm
embrace
perhaps
after
all
it
was
right
that
she
should
embrace
him
after
what
he
had
said
to
her
three
days
only
had
passed
by
and
he
was
still
thinking
what
ought
to
be
his
next
step
when
there
came
to
him
a
letter
from
soames
simpson
attorneys
in
buntingford
he
had
heard
of
soames
simpson
had
been
familiar
with
their
names
for
the
last
twenty
years
but
had
never
dreamed
that
his
own
private
affairs
should
become
a
matter
of
consultation
in
their
office
grey
barry
of
lincoln
inn
were
his
lawyers
who
were
quite
gentlemen
he
knew
nothing
against
soames
simpson
but
he
thought
that
their
work
consisted
generally
in
the
recovery
of
local
debts
soames
simpson
now
wrote
to
him
with
full
details
as
to
his
future
life
their
client
miss
thoroughbung
had
communicated
to
them
his
offer
of
marriage
they
were
acquainted
with
all
the
lady
circumstances
and
she
had
asked
them
for
their
advice
they
had
proposed
to
her
that
the
use
of
her
own
income
should
be
by
deed
left
to
herself
some
proportion
of
it
should
go
into
the
house
and
might
be
made
matter
of
agreement
they
suggested
that
an
annuity
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
year
in
shape
of
dower
should
be
secured
to
their
client
in
the
event
of
her
outliving
prosper
the
estate
should
of
course
be
settled
on
the
eldest
child
the
mother
property
should
be
equally
divided
among
the
other
children
buston
hall
should
be
the
residence
of
the
widow
till
the
eldest
son
should
be
after
which
prosper
would
no
doubt
feel
that
their
client
would
have
to
provide
a
home
for
herself
soames
simpson
did
not
think
that
there
was
anything
in
this
to
which
prosper
would
object
and
if
this
were
so
they
would
immediately
prepare
the
settlement
that
woman
did
say
against
it
after
all
said
matthew
to
himself
as
he
gave
the
letter
from
the
lawyers
to
his
master
the
letter
made
prosper
very
angry
it
did
in
truth
contain
nothing
more
than
a
repetition
of
the
very
terms
which
the
lady
had
herself
suggested
but
coming
to
him
through
these
local
lawyers
it
was
doubly
distasteful
what
was
he
to
do
he
felt
it
to
be
out
of
the
question
to
accede
at
once
indeed
he
had
a
strong
repugnance
to
putting
himself
into
communication
with
the
buntingford
lawyers
had
the
matter
been
other
than
it
was
he
would
have
gone
to
the
rector
for
advice
the
rector
generally
advised
him
but
that
was
out
of
the
question
now
he
had
seen
his
sister
once
since
his
visit
to
buntingford
but
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
it
indeed
he
had
been
anything
but
communicative
so
that
annesley
had
been
forced
to
leave
him
with
a
feeling
almost
of
offense
there
was
no
help
to
be
had
in
that
quarter
and
he
could
only
write
to
grey
and
ask
that
gentleman
to
assist
him
in
his
difficulties
he
did
write
to
grey
begging
for
his
immediate
attention
there
is
that
fool
prosper
going
to
marry
a
brewer
daughter
down
at
buntingford
said
grey
to
his
daughter
he
sixty
years
old
no
my
love
he
looks
it
but
he
only
fifty
a
man
at
fifty
is
supposed
to
be
young
enough
to
marry
there
a
nephew
who
has
been
brought
up
as
his
heir
that
the
hard
part
of
it
and
the
nephew
is
mixed
up
in
some
way
with
the
scarboroughs
is
it
he
who
is
to
marry
that
young
lady
i
think
it
is
and
now
there
some
devil
play
going
on
i
got
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
you
will
have
not
a
turn
prosper
can
marry
if
he
likes
it
they
have
sent
him
most
abominable
proposals
as
to
the
lady
money
and
as
to
her
jointure
i
must
stop
that
if
i
can
though
i
suppose
he
is
not
such
a
fool
as
to
give
way
is
he
soft
well
not
exactly
he
likes
his
own
money
but
he
a
gentleman
and
wants
nothing
but
what
is
or
ought
to
be
his
own
there
are
but
few
like
that
now
it
true
of
him
but
then
he
does
not
know
what
is
his
own
or
what
ought
to
be
he
almost
the
biggest
fool
i
have
ever
known
and
will
do
an
injustice
to
that
boy
simply
from
ignorance
then
he
drafted
his
letter
to
prosper
and
gave
it
to
dolly
to
read
that
what
i
shall
propose
the
clerk
can
put
it
into
proper
language
he
must
offer
less
than
he
means
to
give
is
that
honest
father
it
honest
on
my
part
knowing
the
people
with
whom
i
have
to
deal
if
i
were
to
lay
down
the
strict
minimum
which
he
should
grant
he
would
add
other
things
which
would
cause
him
to
act
not
in
accordance
with
my
advice
i
have
to
make
allowance
for
his
folly
a
sort
of
windage
which
is
not
dishonest
had
he
referred
her
lawyers
to
me
i
could
have
been
as
hard
and
honest
as
you
please
all
which
did
not
quite
satisfy
strict
ideas
of
integrity
but
the
terms
proposed
were
that
the
lady
means
should
be
divided
so
that
should
go
to
herself
for
her
own
personal
expenses
and
the
other
half
to
her
husband
for
the
use
of
the
house
that
the
lady
should
put
up
with
a
jointure
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
ought
to
suffice
when
joined
to
her
own
property
and
that
the
settlement
among
the
children
should
be
as
recommended
by
soames
simpson
and
if
there
are
not
any
children
papa
then
each
will
receive
his
or
her
own
property
because
it
may
be
so
certainly
my
dear
very
probably
chapter
xxviii
harkaway
when
the
first
monday
in
november
came
harry
was
still
living
at
the
rectory
indeed
what
other
home
had
he
in
which
to
live
other
friends
had
become
shy
of
him
besides
his
uncle
he
had
been
accustomed
to
receive
many
invitations
young
men
who
are
the
heirs
to
properties
and
are
supposed
to
be
rich
because
they
are
idle
do
get
themselves
asked
about
here
and
there
and
think
a
great
deal
of
themselves
in
consequence
there
young
jones
he
is
fairly
but
a
word
to
say
for
himself
he
will
do
to
pair
off
with
miss
smith
who
talk
for
a
dozen
he
ca
hit
a
but
he
none
the
worse
for
that
we
have
got
too
many
pheasants
he
be
sure
to
come
when
you
ask
him
and
he
be
sure
to
go
so
jones
is
asked
and
considers
himself
to
be
the
most
popular
man
in
london
i
will
not
say
that
harry
invitations
had
been
of
exactly
that
description
but
he
too
had
considered
himself
to
be
popular
and
now
greatly
felt
the
withdrawal
of
such
marks
of
friendship
he
had
received
one
put
off
from
the
ingoldsbys
of
kent
early
in
june
he
had
promised
to
be
there
in
november
the
youngest
miss
ingoldsby
was
very
pretty
and
he
no
doubt
had
been
gracious
she
knew
that
he
had
meant
nothing
could
have
meant
nothing
but
he
might
come
to
mean
something
and
had
been
most
pressingly
asked
in
september
there
came
a
letter
to
him
to
say
that
the
room
intended
for
him
at
ingoldsby
had
been
burnt
down
ingoldsby
was
so
extremely
sorry
and
so
were
the
girls
harry
could
trace
it
all
up
the
ingoldsbys
knew
the
greens
and
green
was
sister
to
septimus
jones
who
was
absolutely
the
slave
the
slave
as
harry
said
repeating
the
word
to
himself
with
emphasis
of
augustus
scarborough
he
was
very
unhappy
not
that
he
cared
in
the
least
for
any
miss
ingoldsby
but
that
he
began
to
be
conscious
that
he
was
to
be
dropped
he
was
to
be
taken
up
on
the
other
hand
by
joshua
thoroughbung
alas
alas
though
he
smiled
and
resolved
to
accept
his
with
a
good
heart
this
did
not
in
the
least
salve
the
wound
his
own
county
was
to
him
less
than
other
counties
and
his
own
neighborhood
less
than
other
neighborhoods
buntingford
was
full
of
thoroughbungs
the
best
people
in
the
world
but
not
quite
up
to
what
he
believed
to
be
his
mark
prosper
himself
was
the
stupidest
ass
at
welwyn
people
smelled
of
the
city
at
stevenage
the
parsons
set
began
baldock
was
a
of
dulness
royston
was
alive
only
on
of
his
own
father
house
and
even
of
his
mother
and
sisters
he
entertained
ideas
that
savored
a
little
of
depreciation
but
to
redeem
him
from
this
fault
a
fault
which
would
have
led
to
the
absolute
ruin
of
his
character
had
it
not
been
redeemed
and
at
last
cured
there
was
a
consciousness
of
his
own
vanity
and
weakness
my
father
is
worth
a
dozen
of
them
and
my
mother
and
sisters
two
dozen
he
would
say
of
the
ingoldsbys
when
he
went
to
bed
in
the
room
that
was
to
be
burnt
down
in
preparation
for
his
exile
and
he
believed
it
they
were
honest
they
were
unselfish
they
were
unpretending
his
sister
molly
was
not
above
owning
that
her
young
brewer
was
all
the
world
to
her
a
fine
honest
bouncing
girl
who
said
her
prayers
with
a
meaning
thanked
the
lord
for
giving
her
joshua
and
laughed
so
loud
that
you
could
hear
her
out
of
the
rectory
garden
half
across
the
park
harry
knew
that
they
were
good
did
in
his
heart
know
that
where
the
parsons
begin
the
good
things
were
likely
to
begin
also
he
was
in
this
state
of
mind
the
hand
of
good
pulling
one
way
and
the
devil
pride
the
other
when
young
thoroughbung
called
for
him
one
morning
to
carry
him
on
to
cumberlow
green
cumberlow
green
was
a
popular
meet
in
that
county
where
meets
have
not
much
to
make
them
popular
except
the
of
those
who
form
the
hunt
it
is
not
a
county
either
pleasant
or
easy
to
ride
over
and
a
puckeridge
fox
is
surely
the
most
of
foxes
but
the
puckeridge
men
are
gracious
to
strangers
and
fairly
so
among
themselves
it
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
leicestershire
where
sportsmen
ride
in
brilliant
boots
and
breeches
but
with
their
noses
turned
supernaturally
into
the
air
come
along
we
four
miles
to
do
and
twenty
minutes
to
do
it
in
halloo
molly
how
d
do
come
up
on
to
the
step
and
give
us
a
kiss
go
away
said
molly
rushing
back
into
the
house
did
you
ever
hear
anything
like
his
impudence
why
should
you
said
kate
all
the
world
knows
it
then
the
gig
with
the
two
sportsmen
was
driven
on
do
you
think
he
looks
handsome
in
his
pink
coat
whispered
molly
afterward
to
her
elder
sister
only
think
i
have
never
seen
him
in
a
red
coat
since
he
was
my
own
last
april
when
the
hunting
was
over
he
had
spoken
out
and
this
is
the
first
day
he
has
worn
pink
this
year
harry
when
he
reached
the
meet
looked
about
him
to
watch
how
he
was
received
there
are
not
many
more
painful
things
in
life
than
when
an
honest
gallant
young
fellow
has
to
look
about
him
in
such
a
frame
of
mind
it
might
have
been
worse
had
he
deserved
to
be
dropped
some
one
will
say
not
at
all
a
different
condition
of
mind
exists
then
and
a
struggle
is
made
to
overcome
the
judgment
of
men
which
is
not
in
itself
painful
it
is
part
of
the
natural
battle
of
life
which
does
not
hurt
one
at
all
unless
indeed
the
man
hate
himself
for
that
which
has
brought
upon
him
the
hatred
of
others
repentance
is
always
an
agony
and
should
be
so
without
the
agony
there
can
be
no
repentance
but
even
then
it
is
hardly
so
sharp
as
that
feeling
of
injustice
which
accompanies
the
unmeaning
look
and
dumb
faces
and
pretended
indifference
of
those
who
have
condemned
when
harry
descended
from
the
gig
he
found
himself
close
to
old
harkaway
the
master
of
the
hounds
harkaway
was
a
gentleman
who
had
been
master
of
these
hounds
for
more
than
forty
years
and
had
given
as
much
satisfaction
as
the
county
could
produce
his
hounds
which
were
his
hobby
were
perfect
his
horses
were
good
enough
for
the
hertfordshire
lanes
and
hertfordshire
hedges
his
object
was
not
so
much
to
run
a
fox
as
to
kill
him
in
obedience
to
certain
rules
of
the
game
ever
so
many
hinderances
have
been
created
to
bar
the
killing
a
fox
as
for
instance
that
you
should
knock
him
on
the
head
with
a
all
of
which
had
to
harkaway
the
force
of
a
religion
the
laws
of
hunting
are
so
many
that
most
men
who
hunt
can
not
know
them
all
but
no
law
had
ever
been
written
or
had
become
a
law
by
the
strength
of
tradition
which
he
did
not
know
to
break
them
was
to
him
treason
when
a
young
man
broke
them
he
pitied
the
young
man
ignorance
and
endeavored
to
instruct
him
after
some
rough
fashion
when
an
old
man
broke
them
he
regarded
him
as
a
fool
who
should
stay
at
home
or
as
a
traitor
who
should
be
dealt
with
as
such
and
with
such
men
he
could
deal
very
hardly
forty
years
of
reigning
had
taught
him
to
believe
himself
to
be
omnipotent
and
he
was
so
in
his
own
hunt
he
was
a
man
who
had
never
much
affected
social
habits
the
company
of
one
or
two
brother
sportsmen
to
drink
a
glass
of
with
him
and
then
to
go
early
to
bed
was
the
most
of
it
he
had
a
small
library
but
not
a
book
ever
came
off
the
shelf
unless
it
referred
to
farriers
or
the
he
was
unmarried
the
time
which
other
men
gave
to
their
wives
and
families
he
bestowed
upon
his
hounds
to
his
stables
he
never
went
looking
on
a
horse
as
a
necessary
adjunct
to
hunting
expensive
disagreeable
and
prone
to
get
you
into
danger
when
anyone
flattered
him
about
his
horse
he
would
only
grunt
and
turn
his
head
on
one
side
no
one
in
these
latter
years
had
seen
him
jump
any
fence
but
yet
he
was
always
with
his
hounds
and
when
any
one
said
a
kind
word
as
to
their
doings
that
he
would
take
as
a
compliment
it
was
they
who
were
there
to
do
the
work
of
the
day
which
horses
and
men
could
only
look
at
he
was
a
sincere
honest
taciturn
and
withal
affectionate
man
who
could
on
an
occasion
be
very
angry
with
those
who
offended
him
he
knew
well
what
he
could
do
and
never
attempted
that
which
was
beyond
his
power
how
are
you
mr
harkaway
said
harry
how
are
you
annesley
how
are
you
said
the
master
with
all
the
grace
of
which
he
was
capable
but
harry
caught
a
tone
in
his
voice
which
he
thought
implied
displeasure
and
harkaway
had
in
truth
heard
the
story
how
harry
had
been
discarded
at
buston
because
he
had
knocked
the
man
down
in
the
streets
at
and
had
then
gone
away
after
that
harkaway
toddled
off
and
harry
sat
and
frowned
with
embittered
heart
well
and
how
are
you
this
came
from
a
fast
young
banker
who
lived
in
the
neighborhood
and
who
thus
intended
to
show
his
familiarity
with
the
brewer
but
when
he
saw
annesley
he
turned
round
and
rode
away
scaly
trick
that
fellow
played
the
other
day
he
knocked
a
fellow
down
and
when
he
thought
that
he
was
dead
he
lied
about
it
like
old
boots
all
of
which
made
itself
intelligible
to
harry
he
told
himself
that
he
had
always
hated
that
banker
why
do
you
let
such
a
fellow
as
that
call
you
he
said
to
joshua
what
young
florin
he
a
very
good
fellow
and
does
mean
anything
a
vulgar
cad
i
should
say
then
he
rode
on
in
silence
till
he
was
addressed
by
an
old
gentleman
of
the
county
who
had
known
his
father
for
the
last
thirty
years
the
old
gentleman
had
had
nothing
about
him
to
recommend
him
either
to
hatred
or
love
till
he
spoke
and
after
that
harry
hated
him
how
do
mr
annesley
said
the
old
gentleman
and
then
rode
on
harry
knew
that
the
old
man
had
condemned
him
as
the
others
had
done
or
he
would
never
have
called
him
annesley
he
felt
that
he
was
blown
upon
in
his
own
county
as
well
as
by
the
ingoldsbys
down
in
kent
they
had
but
a
moderate
day
sport
going
a
considerable
distance
in
search
of
it
till
an
incident
arose
which
gave
quite
an
interest
to
the
field
generally
and
nearly
brought
joshua
thoroughbung
into
a
scrape
they
were
drawing
a
covert
which
was
undoubtedly
the
property
of
their
own
hunt
or
rather
just
going
to
draw
it
when
all
of
a
sudden
they
became
aware
that
every
hound
in
the
pack
was
hunting
harkaway
at
once
sprung
from
his
usual
cold
apathetic
manner
into
full
action
but
they
who
knew
him
well
could
see
that
it
was
not
the
excitement
of
joy
he
was
in
an
instant
full
of
life
but
it
was
not
the
life
of
successful
enterprise
he
was
perturbed
and
unhappy
and
his
huntsman
dillon
a
silent
cunning
not
very
popular
man
who
would
obey
his
master
in
everything
began
to
move
about
rapidly
and
to
be
at
his
wit
end
the
younger
men
prepared
themselves
for
a
run
one
of
those
sudden
short
decisive
spurts
which
come
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
on
which
a
man
if
he
is
not
quite
awake
to
the
demands
of
the
moment
is
very
apt
to
be
left
behind
but
the
old
stagers
had
their
eyes
on
harkaway
and
knew
that
there
was
something
amiss
then
there
appeared
another
field
of
hunters
first
one
man
leading
them
then
others
following
and
after
them
the
first
ruck
and
then
the
crowd
it
was
apparent
to
all
who
knew
anything
that
two
packs
had
joined
these
were
the
hitchiners
as
the
rival
sportsmen
would
call
them
and
this
was
the
hitchin
hunt
with
fairlawn
their
master
fairlawn
was
also
an
old
man
popular
no
doubt
in
his
own
country
but
by
no
means
beloved
by
harkaway
harkaway
used
to
declare
how
fairlawn
had
behaved
very
badly
about
certain
common
coverts
about
thirty
years
ago
when
the
matter
had
to
be
referred
to
a
committee
of
masters
no
one
in
these
modern
days
knew
aught
of
the
quarrel
or
cared
the
men
of
the
two
hunts
were
very
good
friends
unless
they
met
under
the
joint
eyes
of
the
two
masters
and
then
they
were
supposed
to
be
bound
to
hate
each
other
now
the
two
packs
were
mixed
together
and
there
was
only
one
fox
between
them
the
fox
did
not
trouble
them
long
he
could
hardly
have
saved
himself
from
one
pack
but
very
soon
escaped
from
the
fangs
of
the
two
each
hound
knew
that
his
neighbor
hound
was
a
stranger
and
in
scrutinizing
the
singularity
of
the
occurrence
lost
all
the
power
of
hunting
in
ten
minutes
there
were
nearly
forty
couples
of
hounds
running
hither
and
thither
with
two
huntsmen
and
four
whips
swearing
at
them
with
strange
voices
and
two
old
gentlemen
giving
orders
each
in
opposition
to
the
other
then
each
pack
was
got
together
almost
on
the
same
ground
and
it
was
necessary
that
something
should
be
done
harkaway
waited
to
see
whether
fairlawn
would
ride
away
quickly
to
his
own
country
he
would
not
have
spoken
to
fairlawn
if
he
could
have
helped
it
fairlawn
was
some
miles
away
from
his
country
he
must
have
given
up
the
day
for
lost
had
he
simply
gone
away
but
there
was
another
covert
a
mile
off
and
he
thought
that
one
of
his
hounds
had
shown
a
line
or
said
that
he
thought
so
now
it
is
well
known
that
you
may
follow
a
hunted
fox
through
whatever
country
he
may
take
you
to
if
only
your
hounds
are
hunting
him
continuously
and
one
hound
for
that
purpose
is
as
good
as
thirty
and
if
a
hound
can
only
show
a
line
he
is
held
to
be
hunting
fairlawn
was
quite
sure
that
one
of
his
hounds
had
been
showing
a
line
and
had
been
whipped
off
it
by
one
of
harkaway
men
the
man
swore
that
he
had
only
been
collecting
his
own
hounds
on
this
plea
fairlawn
demanded
to
take
his
whole
pack
into
greasegate
wood
the
very
covert
that
harkaway
had
been
about
to
draw
i
d
d
if
you
do
said
harkaway
standing
whip
in
hand
in
the
middle
of
the
road
so
as
to
prevent
the
enemy
huntsman
passing
by
with
his
hounds
it
was
afterward
declared
that
harkaway
had
not
been
heard
to
curse
and
swear
for
the
last
fifteen
years
i
d
d
if
i
do
said
fairlawn
riding
up
to
him
harkaway
was
ten
years
the
older
man
and
looked
as
though
he
had
much
less
of
fighting
power
but
no
one
saw
him
quail
or
give
an
inch
those
who
watched
his
face
declared
that
his
lips
were
white
with
rage
and
quivered
with
passion
to
tell
the
words
which
passed
between
them
after
that
would
require
homer
pathos
and
homer
imagination
the
two
old
men
scowled
and
scolded
at
each
other
and
had
fairlawn
attempted
to
pass
harkaway
would
certainly
have
struck
him
with
his
whip
and
behind
their
master
a
crowd
of
the
puckeridge
men
collected
themselves
foremost
among
whom
was
joshua
thoroughbung
take
round
to
the
covert
by
winnipeg
lane
said
fairlawn
to
his
huntsman
the
man
prepared
to
take
his
pack
round
by
winnipeg
lane
which
would
have
added
a
mile
to
the
distance
but
the
huntsman
when
he
had
got
a
little
to
the
left
was
soon
seen
scurrying
across
the
country
in
the
direction
of
the
covert
with
a
dozen
others
at
his
heels
and
the
hounds
following
him
but
old
harkaway
had
seen
it
too
and
having
possession
of
the
road
galloped
along
it
at
such
a
pace
that
no
one
could
pass
him
all
the
field
declared
that
they
had
regarded
it
as
impossible
that
their
master
should
move
so
fast
and
dillon
and
the
whips
and
thoroughbung
and
harry
annesley
with
half
a
dozen
others
kept
pace
with
him
they
would
not
sit
there
and
see
their
master
outmanoeuvred
by
any
lack
of
readiness
on
their
part
they
got
to
the
covert
first
and
there
with
their
whips
drawn
were
ready
to
receive
the
second
pack
then
one
hound
went
in
without
an
order
but
for
their
own
hounds
they
did
not
care
they
might
find
a
fox
and
go
after
him
and
nobody
would
follow
them
the
business
here
at
the
was
more
important
and
more
attractive
then
it
was
that
thoroughbung
nearly
fell
into
danger
as
to
the
other
hounds
fairlawn
hounds
doing
any
harm
in
the
covert
or
doing
any
good
for
themselves
or
their
owners
that
was
out
of
the
question
the
rival
pack
was
already
there
with
their
noses
up
in
the
air
and
thinking
of
anything
but
a
fox
and
this
other
pack
the
hitchiners
were
just
as
wild
but
it
was
the
object
of
to
say
that
they
had
drawn
the
covert
in
the
teeth
of
harkaway
and
to
achieve
this
one
of
the
whips
thought
that
he
could
ride
through
the
puckeridge
men
taking
a
couple
of
hounds
with
him
that
would
suffice
for
triumph
but
to
prevent
such
triumph
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
joshua
thoroughbung
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
himself
he
rode
right
at
the
whip
with
his
own
whip
raised
and
would
undoubtedly
have
ridden
over
him
had
not
the
whip
tried
to
turn
his
horse
sharp
round
stumbled
and
fallen
in
the
struggle
and
had
not
thoroughbung
with
his
horse
fallen
over
him
it
will
be
the
case
that
a
slight
danger
or
injury
in
one
direction
will
often
stop
a
course
of
action
calculated
to
create
greater
dangers
and
worse
injuries
so
it
was
in
this
case
when
dick
the
hitchin
whip
went
down
and
thoroughbung
with
his
horse
was
over
him
two
men
and
two
horses
struggling
together
on
the
ground
all
desire
to
carry
on
the
fight
was
over
the
huntsman
came
up
and
at
last
fairlawn
also
and
considered
it
to
be
their
duty
to
pick
up
dick
whose
breath
was
knocked
out
of
him
by
the
weight
of
joshua
thoroughbung
and
the
puckeridge
side
felt
it
to
be
necessary
to
give
their
aid
to
the
valiant
brewer
there
was
then
no
more
attempt
to
draw
the
covert
each
general
in
gloomy
silence
took
off
his
forces
and
each
afterward
deemed
that
the
victory
was
his
dick
swore
when
brought
to
himself
that
one
of
his
hounds
had
gone
in
whereas
squire
had
swore
most
oaths
that
no
should
ever
live
to
put
his
nose
in
one
of
and
squire
would
have
to
be
well
dick
declared
that
he
would
not
say
what
would
happen
to
harkaway
chapter
xxix
riding
home
the
two
old
gentlemen
rode
away
each
in
his
own
direction
in
gloomy
silence
not
a
word
was
said
by
either
of
them
even
to
one
of
his
own
followers
it
was
nearly
twenty
miles
to
harkaway
house
and
along
the
entire
twenty
miles
he
rode
silent
he
in
an
awful
passion
said
thoroughbung
he
ca
speak
from
anger
but
to
tell
the
truth
harkaway
was
ashamed
of
himself
he
was
an
old
gentleman
between
seventy
and
eighty
who
was
supposed
to
go
out
for
his
amusement
and
had
allowed
himself
to
be
betrayed
into
most
unseemly
language
what
though
the
hound
had
not
shown
a
line
was
it
necessary
that
he
at
his
time
of
life
should
fight
on
the
road
for
the
maintenance
of
a
trifling
right
of
sport
but
yet
there
came
upon
him
from
time
to
time
a
sense
of
the
deep
injury
done
to
him
that
man
fairlawn
that
blackguard
that
creature
of
all
others
the
farthest
removed
from
a
gentleman
had
declared
that
in
his
harkaway
teeth
he
would
draw
his
harkaway
covert
then
he
would
urge
on
his
old
horse
and
gnash
his
teeth
and
then
again
he
would
be
ashamed
tantaene
animis
coelestibus
irae
but
thoroughbung
rode
home
high
in
spirits
very
proud
and
conscious
of
having
done
good
work
he
was
always
anxious
to
stand
well
with
the
hunt
generally
and
was
aware
that
he
had
now
distinguished
himself
harry
annesley
was
on
one
side
of
him
and
on
the
other
rode
florin
the
banker
he
an
abominable
liar
said
thoroughbung
a
wicked
wretched
liar
he
was
alluding
to
the
hitchiner
whip
whom
in
his
wrath
he
had
nearly
sent
to
another
world
he
says
that
one
of
his
hounds
got
into
the
covert
but
i
was
there
and
saw
it
all
not
a
nose
was
over
the
little
bank
which
runs
between
the
field
and
the
covert
you
must
have
seen
a
hound
if
he
had
been
there
said
the
banker
i
was
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
and
could
count
the
hounds
he
had
with
him
there
were
three
of
them
a
big
bitch
was
leading
the
one
that
i
nearly
fell
upon
when
the
man
went
down
the
hound
stopped
not
knowing
what
was
expected
of
him
how
should
he
the
man
would
have
been
in
the
covert
but
by
george
i
managed
to
stop
him
what
did
you
mean
to
do
to
him
when
you
rode
at
him
so
furiously
asked
harry
not
let
him
get
in
there
that
was
my
resolute
purpose
i
suppose
i
should
have
knocked
him
off
his
horse
with
my
whip
but
suppose
he
had
knocked
you
off
your
horse
suggested
the
banker
there
is
no
knowing
how
that
might
have
been
i
never
calculated
those
chances
when
a
man
wants
to
do
a
thing
like
that
he
generally
does
it
and
you
did
it
said
harry
yes
i
think
i
did
i
dare
say
his
bones
are
sore
i
know
mine
are
but
i
do
care
for
that
in
the
least
when
this
day
comes
to
be
talked
about
as
i
dare
say
it
will
be
for
many
a
long
year
no
one
will
be
able
to
say
that
the
hitchiners
got
into
that
covert
thoroughbung
with
the
genuine
modesty
of
an
englishman
would
not
say
that
he
had
achieved
by
his
own
prowess
all
this
glory
for
the
puckeridge
hunt
but
he
felt
it
down
to
the
very
end
of
his
nails
had
he
not
been
there
that
whip
would
have
got
into
the
wood
and
a
very
different
tale
would
then
have
been
told
in
those
coming
years
to
which
his
mind
was
running
away
with
happy
thoughts
he
had
ridden
the
aggressors
down
he
had
stopped
the
first
intrusive
hound
but
though
he
continued
to
talk
of
the
subject
he
did
not
boast
in
so
many
words
that
he
had
done
it
his
veni
vidi
vici
was
confined
to
his
own
bosom
as
they
rode
home
together
there
came
to
be
a
little
crowd
of
men
round
thoroughbung
giving
him
the
praises
that
were
his
due
but
one
by
one
they
fell
off
from
annesley
side
of
the
road
he
soon
felt
that
no
one
addressed
a
word
to
him
he
was
probably
too
prone
to
encourage
them
in
this
it
was
he
that
fell
away
and
courted
loneliness
and
then
in
his
heart
accused
them
there
was
no
doubt
something
of
truth
in
his
accusations
but
another
man
less
sensitive
might
have
lived
it
down
he
did
more
than
meet
their
coldness
and
then
complained
to
himself
of
the
bitterness
of
the
world
they
are
like
the
beasts
of
the
field
he
said
who
when
another
beast
has
been
wounded
turn
upon
him
and
rend
him
to
death
his
future
the
best
natured
fellow
that
ever
was
born
rode
on
thoughtless
and
left
harry
alone
for
three
or
four
miles
while
he
received
the
pleasant
plaudits
of
his
companions
in
joshua
heart
was
that
tale
of
the
whip
discomfiture
he
did
not
see
that
molly
brother
was
alone
as
soon
as
he
would
have
done
but
for
his
own
glory
he
is
the
same
as
the
others
said
harry
to
himself
because
that
man
has
told
a
falsehood
of
me
and
has
had
the
wit
to
surround
it
with
circumstances
he
thinks
it
becomes
him
to
ride
away
and
cut
me
then
he
asked
himself
some
foolish
questions
as
to
himself
and
as
to
joshua
thoroughbung
which
he
did
not
answer
as
he
should
have
done
had
he
remembered
that
he
was
then
riding
thoroughbung
horse
and
that
his
sister
was
to
become
wife
after
half
an
hour
of
triumphant
ovation
joshua
remembered
his
and
did
fall
back
so
as
to
pick
him
up
what
the
matter
harry
why
do
you
come
on
and
join
us
i
sick
of
hearing
of
that
infernal
squabble
well
as
to
a
squabble
harkaway
behaved
quite
right
if
a
hunt
is
to
be
kept
up
the
right
of
entering
coverts
must
be
preserved
for
the
hunt
they
belong
to
there
was
no
line
shown
you
must
remember
that
there
is
a
doubt
about
that
the
hounds
were
all
astray
when
we
joined
them
it
a
great
question
whether
they
brought
their
fox
into
that
first
covert
there
are
they
who
think
that
bodkin
was
just
riding
across
the
puckeridge
country
in
search
of
a
fox
bodkin
was
fairlawn
huntsman
if
you
admit
that
kind
of
thing
where
will
you
be
as
a
hunting
country
just
nowhere
then
as
a
sportsman
where
are
you
it
is
necessary
to
put
down
such
gross
fraud
my
own
impression
is
that
fairlawn
should
be
turned
out
from
being
master
i
own
i
feel
very
strongly
about
it
but
then
i
always
have
been
fond
of
hunting
just
so
said
harry
sulkily
who
was
not
in
the
least
interested
as
to
the
matter
on
which
joshua
was
so
eloquent
then
proctor
rode
by
the
gentleman
who
in
the
early
part
of
the
day
disgusted
harry
by
calling
him
mister
now
proctor
continued
joshua
i
appeal
to
you
whether
harkaway
was
not
quite
right
if
you
wo
stick
up
for
your
rights
in
a
hunting
county
but
proctor
rode
on
wishing
them
very
discourteously
declining
to
hear
the
remainder
of
the
brewer
arguments
he
in
a
hurry
i
suppose
said
joshua
you
better
follow
him
you
find
that
he
listen
to
you
then
i
do
want
him
to
listen
to
me
particularly
i
thought
you
did
then
for
half
an
hour
the
two
men
rode
on
in
silence
what
the
matter
with
you
harry
said
joshua
i
can
see
something
up
that
riles
you
i
know
you
a
fellow
of
your
college
and
have
other
things
to
think
of
besides
the
vagaries
of
a
fox
the
fellow
of
a
college
said
harry
who
had
he
been
in
a
would
have
thought
much
more
of
being
along
with
a
lot
of
than
of
any
college
honors
well
yes
i
suppose
it
is
a
great
thing
to
be
a
fellow
of
a
college
i
never
could
have
been
one
if
i
had
mugged
forever
my
being
a
fellow
of
a
college
wo
do
me
much
good
did
you
see
that
old
man
proctor
go
by
just
now
oh
yes
he
never
likes
to
be
out
after
a
certain
hour
and
did
you
see
florin
and
harkaway
and
a
lot
of
others
you
yourself
have
been
going
on
ahead
for
the
last
hour
without
speaking
to
me
how
do
you
mean
without
speaking
to
you
said
joshua
turning
sharp
round
then
harry
annesley
reflected
that
he
was
doing
an
injustice
to
his
future
perhaps
i
have
done
you
wrong
he
said
you
have
i
beg
your
pardon
i
believe
you
are
as
honest
and
true
a
fellow
as
there
is
in
hertfordshire
but
for
those
others
you
think
it
about
mountjoy
scarborough
then
asked
joshua
i
do
that
infernal
fool
peter
prosper
has
chosen
to
publish
to
the
world
that
he
has
dropped
me
because
of
something
that
he
has
heard
of
that
occurrence
a
wretched
lie
has
been
told
with
a
purpose
by
mountjoy
scarborough
brother
and
my
uncle
has
taken
it
into
his
wise
head
to
believe
it
the
truth
is
i
have
not
been
as
respectful
to
him
as
he
thinks
i
ought
and
now
he
resents
my
neglect
in
this
fashion
he
is
going
to
marry
your
aunt
in
order
that
he
may
have
a
lot
of
children
and
cut
me
out
in
order
to
justify
himself
he
has
told
these
lies
about
me
and
you
see
the
consequence
not
a
man
in
the
county
is
willing
to
speak
to
me
i
really
think
a
great
deal
of
it
fancy
you
go
and
ask
harkaway
he
honest
and
he
tell
you
ask
this
new
cousin
of
yours
mr
prosper
i
do
know
that
they
are
going
to
make
a
match
of
it
after
all
ask
my
own
father
only
think
of
it
that
a
puling
puking
idiot
like
that
from
a
mere
freak
should
be
able
to
do
a
man
such
a
mischief
he
can
rob
me
of
my
income
which
he
himself
has
brought
me
up
to
expect
that
he
can
do
by
a
stroke
of
his
pen
he
can
threaten
to
have
sons
like
priam
all
that
is
within
his
own
bosom
but
to
justify
himself
to
the
world
at
large
he
picks
up
a
scandalous
story
from
a
man
like
augustus
scarborough
and
immediately
not
a
man
in
the
county
will
speak
to
me
i
say
that
that
is
enough
to
break
a
man
heart
not
the
injury
done
which
a
man
should
bear
but
the
injustice
of
the
doing
who
wants
his
beggarly
allowance
he
can
do
as
he
likes
about
his
own
money
i
shall
never
ask
him
for
his
money
but
that
he
should
tell
such
a
lie
as
this
about
the
county
is
more
than
a
man
can
endure
what
was
it
that
did
happen
asked
joshua
the
man
met
me
in
the
street
when
he
was
drunk
and
he
struck
at
me
and
was
insolent
of
course
i
knocked
him
down
who
would
have
done
the
same
then
his
brother
found
him
somewhere
or
got
hold
of
him
and
sent
him
out
of
the
country
and
says
that
i
had
held
my
tongue
when
i
left
him
in
the
street
of
course
i
held
my
tongue
what
was
mountjoy
to
me
then
augustus
has
asked
me
sly
questions
and
accuses
me
of
lying
because
i
did
not
choose
to
tell
him
everything
it
all
comes
out
of
that
here
they
had
reached
the
rectory
and
harry
after
seeing
that
the
horses
were
properly
supplied
with
gruel
took
himself
and
his
to
his
own
chamber
but
joshua
had
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
one
of
the
inmates
of
the
rectory
he
felt
that
it
would
be
improper
to
ride
his
horse
home
without
giving
time
to
the
animal
to
drink
his
gruel
and
therefore
made
his
way
into
the
little
where
molly
had
a
cup
of
tea
and
buttered
toast
ready
for
him
he
of
course
told
her
first
of
the
grand
occurrence
of
the
day
how
the
two
packs
of
hounds
had
mixed
themselves
together
how
violently
the
two
masters
had
fallen
out
and
had
nearly
flogged
each
other
how
harkaway
had
sworn
horribly
who
had
never
been
heard
to
swear
before
how
a
final
attempt
had
been
made
to
seize
a
second
covert
and
how
at
last
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
had
distinguished
himself
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
absolutely
rode
over
the
unfortunate
man
asked
molly
i
did
not
that
the
man
had
the
worst
of
it
or
very
much
the
worse
there
we
were
both
down
and
the
two
horses
all
in
a
heap
together
oh
joshua
suppose
you
had
been
kicked
in
that
case
i
should
have
been
kicked
but
a
kick
from
an
infuriated
horse
there
was
much
infuriation
about
him
the
man
had
ridden
all
that
out
of
the
beast
you
are
sure
to
laugh
at
me
joshua
because
i
think
what
terrible
things
might
have
happened
to
you
why
do
you
go
putting
yourself
so
forward
in
every
danger
now
that
you
have
got
somebody
else
to
depend
upon
you
and
to
care
for
you
it
very
very
wrong
somebody
had
to
do
it
molly
it
was
most
important
in
the
interests
of
hunting
generally
that
those
hounds
should
not
have
been
allowed
to
get
into
that
covert
i
do
think
that
outsiders
ever
understand
how
essential
it
is
to
maintain
your
rights
it
is
as
though
it
were
an
individual
the
whole
county
may
depend
upon
it
why
should
it
be
some
man
who
has
got
a
young
woman
to
look
after
said
molly
half
laughing
and
half
crying
it
the
man
who
first
gets
there
who
ought
to
do
it
said
joshua
a
man
ca
stop
to
remember
whether
he
has
got
a
young
woman
or
not
i
do
think
you
ever
want
to
remember
then
that
little
quarrel
was
brought
to
the
usual
end
with
the
usual
blandishments
and
joshua
went
on
to
discuss
with
her
that
other
source
of
trouble
her
brother
fall
harry
is
awfully
cut
up
said
the
brewer
you
mean
these
affairs
about
his
uncle
yes
it
is
only
the
money
he
feels
or
the
property
but
people
look
askew
at
him
you
ought
all
of
you
to
be
very
kind
to
him
i
am
sure
we
are
there
is
something
in
it
to
vex
him
that
stupid
old
fool
your
uncle
i
beg
your
pardon
you
know
for
speaking
of
him
in
that
way
he
is
a
stupid
old
fool
is
behaving
very
badly
i
do
know
whether
he
should
be
treated
as
i
did
that
fellow
up
at
the
covert
ride
over
him
something
of
that
kind
of
course
harry
is
sore
about
it
and
when
a
man
is
sore
he
frets
at
a
thing
like
that
more
than
he
ought
to
do
as
for
that
aunt
of
mine
at
buntingford
there
seems
to
be
some
hitch
in
it
i
should
have
said
she
have
married
the
old
gentleman
had
he
asked
her
do
talk
like
that
joshua
but
there
is
some
screw
loose
simpson
came
up
to
my
father
about
it
yesterday
and
the
governor
let
enough
of
the
cat
out
of
the
bag
to
make
me
know
that
the
thing
is
not
going
as
straight
as
she
wishes
he
has
offered
then
i
am
sure
he
has
asked
her
and
your
aunt
will
accept
him
asked
molly
there
probably
some
difference
about
money
it
all
done
with
the
intention
of
injuring
poor
harry
if
he
were
my
own
brother
i
could
not
be
more
unhappy
about
him
and
as
to
aunt
matilda
she
a
fool
there
are
two
fools
together
if
they
choose
to
marry
we
ca
hinder
them
but
there
is
some
screw
loose
and
if
the
two
young
lovers
do
know
their
own
minds
things
may
come
right
at
last
then
with
some
farther
blandishments
the
prosperous
brewer
walked
away
chapter
xxx
persecution
in
the
mean
time
florence
mountjoy
was
not
passing
her
time
pleasantly
at
brussels
various
troubles
there
attended
her
all
her
friends
around
her
were
opposed
to
her
marriage
with
harry
annesley
harry
annesley
had
become
a
very
unsavory
word
in
the
mouths
of
sir
magnus
and
the
british
embassy
generally
mountjoy
told
her
grief
to
her
who
thoroughly
took
her
part
as
did
also
very
strongly
lady
mountjoy
it
got
to
be
generally
understood
that
harry
was
a
such
was
the
name
that
was
attached
to
him
and
the
belief
so
conveyed
was
thoroughly
entertained
by
them
all
sir
magnus
had
written
to
friends
in
london
and
the
friends
in
london
bore
out
the
reports
that
were
so
conveyed
the
story
of
the
midnight
quarrel
was
told
in
a
manner
very
prejudicial
to
poor
harry
and
both
sir
magnus
and
his
wife
saw
the
necessity
of
preserving
their
niece
from
anything
so
evil
as
such
a
marriage
but
florence
was
very
firm
and
was
considered
to
be
very
obstinate
to
her
mother
she
was
obstinate
but
affectionate
to
sir
magnus
she
was
obstinate
and
in
some
degree
respectful
but
to
lady
mountjoy
she
was
neither
affectionate
nor
respectful
she
took
a
great
dislike
to
lady
mountjoy
who
endeavored
to
domineer
and
who
by
the
assistance
of
the
two
others
was
in
fact
tyrannical
it
was
her
opinion
that
the
girl
should
be
compelled
to
abandon
the
man
and
mountjoy
found
herself
constrained
to
follow
this
advice
she
did
love
her
daughter
who
was
her
only
child
the
main
interest
of
her
life
was
centred
in
her
daughter
her
only
remaining
ambition
rested
on
her
daughter
marriage
she
had
long
revelled
in
the
anticipation
of
being
the
of
the
owner
of
tretton
park
she
had
been
very
proud
of
her
daughter
beauty
then
had
come
the
first
blow
when
harry
annesley
had
come
to
montpelier
place
and
had
been
welcomed
by
florence
mountjoy
had
seen
it
all
long
before
florence
had
been
aware
of
it
and
the
first
coming
of
harry
had
been
long
before
the
absolute
disgrace
of
captain
scarborough
at
any
rate
before
the
tidings
of
that
disgrace
had
reached
cheltenham
mountjoy
had
been
still
able
to
dream
of
tretton
park
after
the
jews
had
got
their
fingers
on
it
even
after
the
jews
had
been
forced
to
relinquish
their
hold
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
up
to
this
very
time
mountjoy
had
lost
all
hope
in
her
nephew
thinking
that
as
the
property
had
been
entailed
some
portion
of
it
must
ultimately
belong
to
him
she
had
heard
that
augustus
was
to
have
it
and
her
desires
had
vacillated
between
the
two
then
harry
had
positively
declared
himself
and
augustus
had
given
her
to
understand
how
wretched
how
mean
how
wicked
had
been
harry
conduct
and
he
fully
explained
to
her
that
harry
would
be
penniless
she
had
indeed
been
aware
that
buston
quite
a
trifling
thing
compared
to
tretton
was
to
belong
to
him
but
entails
were
nothing
nowadays
it
was
part
of
the
radical
abomination
to
which
england
was
being
subjected
not
even
buston
was
now
to
belong
to
harry
annesley
the
small
income
which
he
had
received
from
his
uncle
was
stopped
he
was
reduced
to
live
upon
his
fellowship
which
would
be
stopped
also
if
he
married
she
even
despised
him
because
he
was
the
fellow
of
a
college
she
had
looked
for
a
husband
for
her
daughter
so
much
higher
than
any
college
could
produce
it
was
not
from
any
lack
of
motherly
love
that
she
was
opposed
to
florence
or
from
any
innate
cruelty
that
she
handed
her
daughter
over
to
the
tender
mercies
of
lady
mountjoy
and
since
she
had
been
at
brussels
there
had
come
up
farther
hopes
another
mode
had
shown
itself
of
escaping
harry
annesley
who
was
of
all
catastrophes
the
most
dreaded
and
hated
anderson
the
second
secretary
of
legation
he
whose
business
it
was
to
ride
about
the
boulevard
with
sir
magnus
had
now
declared
himself
in
form
never
saw
a
fellow
so
bowled
over
sir
magnus
had
declared
by
which
he
had
intended
to
signify
that
anderson
was
now
truly
in
love
i
seen
him
spooney
a
dozen
times
sir
magnus
had
said
confidentially
to
his
but
he
has
never
gone
to
this
length
he
has
asked
a
lot
of
girls
to
have
him
but
he
has
always
been
off
it
again
before
the
week
was
over
he
has
written
to
his
mother
now
and
anderson
showed
his
love
by
very
unmistakable
signs
sir
magnus
too
and
lady
mountjoy
were
evidently
on
the
same
side
as
anderson
sir
magnus
thought
there
was
no
longer
any
good
in
waiting
for
his
nephew
the
captain
and
of
that
other
nephew
augustus
he
did
not
entertain
any
very
high
idea
sir
magnus
had
corresponded
lately
with
augustus
and
was
certainly
not
on
his
side
but
he
so
painted
anderson
prospects
in
life
as
did
also
lady
mountjoy
as
to
make
it
appear
that
if
florence
could
put
up
with
young
anderson
she
would
do
very
well
with
herself
he
sure
to
be
a
baronet
some
of
these
days
you
know
said
sir
magnus
i
do
think
that
would
go
very
far
with
florence
said
her
mother
but
it
ought
look
about
in
the
world
and
you
see
that
it
does
go
a
long
way
he
be
the
fifth
baronet
but
his
elder
brother
is
alive
the
queerest
fellow
you
ever
saw
in
your
born
days
and
his
life
is
not
worth
a
year
purchase
he
got
some
infernal
disease
nostalgia
or
what
d
call
it
which
never
leaves
him
a
moment
peace
and
then
he
drinks
nothing
but
milk
sure
to
go
off
cock
sure
i
should
like
florence
to
count
upon
that
and
then
hugh
anderson
the
fellow
here
is
very
well
off
as
it
is
he
has
four
hundred
pounds
here
and
another
five
hundred
pounds
of
his
own
florence
has
or
will
have
four
hundred
pounds
of
her
own
i
should
call
them
deuced
rich
i
should
indeed
as
beginners
she
could
have
her
pair
of
ponies
here
and
what
more
would
she
want
these
arguments
did
go
very
far
with
mountjoy
the
farther
because
in
her
estimation
sir
magnus
was
a
great
man
he
was
the
greatest
englishman
at
any
rate
in
brussels
and
where
should
she
go
for
advice
but
to
an
englishman
and
she
did
not
know
that
sir
magnus
had
succeeded
in
borrowing
a
considerable
sum
of
money
from
his
second
secretary
of
legation
leave
her
to
me
for
a
little
just
leave
her
to
me
said
lady
mountjoy
i
would
not
say
anything
hard
to
her
said
the
mother
pleading
for
her
naughty
child
not
too
hard
but
she
must
be
made
to
understand
you
see
there
have
been
misfortunes
as
to
mountjoy
scarborough
he
past
hoping
for
you
think
so
altogether
when
a
man
has
disappeared
there
an
end
of
him
there
was
lord
baltiboy
younger
son
disappeared
and
he
turned
out
to
be
a
zouave
corporal
in
a
french
regiment
they
did
get
him
out
of
course
but
then
he
went
preaching
in
america
you
may
take
it
for
granted
that
when
a
man
has
absolutely
vanished
from
the
clubs
he
never
be
any
good
again
as
a
marrying
man
but
there
his
brother
who
they
say
is
to
have
the
property
a
very
sort
of
young
man
who
does
care
a
straw
for
his
own
family
he
had
received
very
sternly
the
overtures
for
a
loan
from
sir
magnus
and
he
as
i
understand
has
never
declared
himself
in
florence
favor
you
ca
count
upon
augustus
scarborough
not
just
count
upon
him
whereas
there
young
anderson
who
is
the
most
young
man
i
know
all
ready
it
will
have
been
such
a
turn
of
luck
your
coming
here
and
catching
him
up
i
do
know
that
it
can
be
called
a
turn
of
luck
florence
has
a
very
nice
fortune
of
her
own
and
she
wants
to
give
it
to
this
penniless
reprobate
it
is
just
one
of
those
cases
in
which
you
must
deal
roundly
with
a
girl
she
has
to
be
frightened
and
that
about
the
truth
of
it
after
this
lady
mountjoy
did
succeed
in
getting
florence
alone
with
herself
into
her
when
her
mother
told
her
that
her
aunt
wished
to
see
her
she
answered
first
that
she
had
no
special
wish
to
see
her
aunt
her
mother
declared
that
in
her
aunt
house
she
was
bound
to
go
when
her
aunt
sent
for
her
to
this
florence
demurred
she
was
she
thought
her
aunt
guest
but
by
no
means
at
her
aunt
disposal
but
at
last
she
obeyed
her
mother
she
had
resolved
that
she
would
obey
her
mother
in
all
things
but
one
and
therefore
she
went
one
morning
to
her
aunt
chamber
but
as
she
went
she
was
on
the
first
instance
caught
by
her
uncle
and
taken
by
him
into
a
little
private
sanctum
behind
his
official
room
my
dear
he
said
just
come
in
here
for
two
minutes
i
am
on
my
way
up
to
my
aunt
i
know
it
my
dear
lady
mountjoy
has
been
talking
it
all
over
with
me
upon
my
word
you
ca
do
anything
better
than
take
young
anderson
i
ca
do
that
uncle
magnus
why
not
there
poor
mountjoy
scarborough
he
has
gone
astray
there
is
no
question
of
my
cousin
and
augustus
is
no
better
there
is
no
question
of
augustus
either
as
to
that
other
chap
he
is
any
good
he
is
indeed
you
mean
mr
annesley
yes
harry
annesley
as
you
call
him
he
has
got
a
shilling
to
bless
himself
with
or
would
have
if
he
was
to
marry
you
but
i
have
got
something
not
enough
for
both
of
you
i
afraid
that
uncle
of
his
has
disinherited
him
his
uncle
ca
disinherit
him
he
quite
young
enough
to
marry
and
have
a
family
and
then
annesley
will
be
disinherited
he
has
stopped
his
allowance
anyway
and
you
must
think
of
him
he
did
something
uncommonly
unhandsome
the
other
day
though
i
do
quite
know
what
he
did
nothing
unhandsome
uncle
magnus
of
course
a
young
lady
will
stand
up
for
her
lover
but
you
will
really
have
to
drop
him
i
not
a
hard
sort
of
man
but
this
was
something
that
the
world
will
not
stand
when
he
thought
the
man
had
been
murdered
he
did
say
anything
about
it
for
fear
they
should
tax
him
with
it
and
then
he
swore
he
had
never
seen
him
it
was
something
of
that
sort
he
never
feared
that
any
one
would
suspect
him
and
now
young
anderson
has
proposed
i
should
not
have
spoken
else
but
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
about
young
anderson
he
a
gentleman
all
round
so
is
mr
annesley
and
anderson
has
got
into
no
trouble
at
all
he
does
his
duty
here
uncommonly
well
i
never
had
less
trouble
with
any
young
fellow
than
i
have
had
with
him
no
licking
him
into
shape
or
next
to
none
and
he
has
a
very
nice
private
income
you
together
would
have
plenty
and
could
live
here
till
you
had
settled
on
apartments
a
pair
of
ponies
would
be
just
the
thing
for
you
to
drive
about
and
support
the
british
interests
you
think
of
it
my
dear
and
you
find
that
i
right
then
florence
escaped
from
that
room
and
went
up
to
receive
the
much
more
severe
lecture
which
she
was
to
have
from
her
aunt
come
in
my
dear
said
lady
mountjoy
in
her
most
austere
voice
she
had
a
voice
which
could
assume
austerity
when
she
knew
her
power
to
be
in
the
ascendant
as
florence
entered
the
room
miss
abbott
left
it
by
a
door
on
the
other
side
take
that
chair
florence
i
want
to
have
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
you
then
florence
sat
down
when
a
young
lady
is
thinking
of
being
married
a
great
many
things
have
to
be
taken
into
consideration
this
seemed
to
be
so
much
a
matter
of
fact
that
florence
did
not
feel
it
necessary
to
make
any
reply
of
course
i
am
aware
you
are
thinking
of
being
married
oh
yes
said
florence
but
to
whom
to
harry
annesley
said
florence
intending
to
imply
that
all
the
world
knew
that
i
hope
not
i
hope
not
indeed
i
may
say
that
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
in
the
first
place
he
is
a
beggar
he
has
begged
from
none
said
florence
he
is
what
the
world
calls
a
beggar
when
a
young
man
without
a
penny
thinks
of
being
married
i
not
a
beggar
and
what
i
got
will
be
his
my
dear
you
talking
about
what
you
do
understand
a
young
lady
can
not
give
her
money
away
in
that
manner
it
will
not
be
allowed
neither
your
mother
nor
sir
magnus
nor
will
i
permit
it
here
florence
restrained
herself
but
drew
herself
up
in
her
chair
as
though
prepared
to
speak
out
her
mind
if
she
should
be
driven
lady
mountjoy
would
not
permit
it
she
thought
that
she
would
feel
herself
quite
able
to
tell
lady
mountjoy
that
she
had
neither
power
nor
influence
in
the
matter
but
she
determined
to
be
silent
a
little
longer
in
the
first
place
a
gentleman
who
is
a
gentleman
never
attempts
to
marry
a
lady
for
her
money
but
when
a
lady
has
the
money
she
can
express
herself
much
more
clearly
than
she
could
otherwise
i
do
quite
understand
what
you
mean
by
that
my
dear
when
annesley
proposed
to
me
he
was
the
acknowledged
heir
to
his
uncle
property
a
trumpery
affair
at
the
best
of
it
it
would
have
sufficed
for
me
then
i
accepted
him
that
goes
for
nothing
from
a
lady
of
course
your
acceptance
was
contingent
on
circumstances
it
was
so
on
my
regard
having
accepted
him
and
as
my
regard
remains
just
as
warm
as
ever
i
certainly
shall
not
go
back
because
of
anything
his
uncle
may
do
i
only
say
this
to
explain
that
he
was
quite
justified
in
his
offer
it
was
not
for
my
small
fortune
that
he
came
to
me
i
not
so
sure
of
that
but
if
my
money
can
be
of
any
use
to
him
he
quite
welcome
to
it
sir
magnus
spoke
to
me
about
a
pair
of
ponies
i
rather
have
him
than
a
pair
of
ponies
i
coming
to
that
just
now
here
is
mr
anderson
oh
yes
he
here
there
was
certainly
a
touch
of
impatience
in
the
tone
in
which
this
was
uttered
it
was
as
though
she
had
said
that
anderson
had
so
contrived
that
she
could
have
no
doubt
whatever
about
his
continued
presence
anderson
had
made
himself
so
conspicuous
as
to
be
visible
to
her
constantly
lady
mountjoy
who
intended
at
present
to
sing
anderson
praises
felt
this
to
be
impertinent
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
anderson
has
behaved
himself
quite
like
a
gentleman
and
you
ought
to
be
very
proud
of
any
token
you
may
receive
of
his
regard
and
affection
but
i
not
bound
to
return
to
it
you
are
bound
to
think
of
it
when
those
who
are
responsible
for
your
actions
tell
you
to
do
so
mamma
you
mean
i
mean
your
uncle
sir
magnus
mountjoy
she
did
not
quite
dare
to
say
that
she
had
meant
herself
i
suppose
you
will
admit
that
sir
magnus
is
a
competent
judge
of
young
men
characters
he
may
be
a
judge
of
anderson
because
anderson
is
his
clerk
there
was
something
of
an
intention
to
depreciate
in
the
word
clerk
florence
had
not
thought
much
of
anderson
worth
nor
as
far
as
she
had
seen
them
of
the
duties
generally
performed
at
the
british
embassy
she
was
ignorant
of
the
peculiar
little
niceties
and
intricacies
which
required
the
residence
at
brussels
of
a
gentleman
with
all
the
tact
possessed
by
sir
magnus
she
did
not
know
that
while
the
mere
international
work
of
the
office
might
be
safely
intrusted
to
blow
and
bunderdown
all
those
little
niceties
that
smiling
and
that
frowning
that
taking
off
of
hats
and
only
half
taking
them
off
that
genial
easy
manner
and
that
stiff
hauteur
formed
the
peculiar
branch
of
sir
magnus
himself
and
under
sir
magnus
of
anderson
she
did
not
understand
that
even
to
that
pair
of
ponies
which
was
promised
to
her
were
to
be
attached
certain
important
functions
which
she
was
to
control
as
the
deputy
of
the
great
man
deputy
and
now
she
had
called
the
great
man
deputy
a
clerk
anderson
is
no
such
thing
said
lady
mountjoy
his
young
man
then
or
private
secretary
only
somebody
else
is
that
you
are
very
impertinent
and
very
ungrateful
anderson
is
second
secretary
of
legation
there
is
no
officer
attached
to
our
establishment
of
more
importance
i
believe
you
say
it
on
purpose
to
anger
me
and
then
you
compare
this
gentleman
to
annesley
a
man
to
whom
no
one
will
speak
i
will
speak
to
him
had
harry
heard
her
say
that
he
ought
to
have
been
a
happy
man
in
spite
of
his
trouble
you
what
good
can
you
do
him
florence
nodded
her
head
almost
imperceptibly
but
still
there
was
a
nod
signifying
more
than
she
could
possibly
say
she
thought
that
she
could
do
him
a
world
of
good
if
she
were
near
him
and
some
good
too
though
she
were
far
away
if
she
were
with
him
she
could
hang
on
to
his
arm
or
perhaps
at
some
future
time
round
his
neck
and
tell
him
that
she
would
be
true
to
him
though
all
others
might
turn
away
and
she
could
be
just
as
true
where
she
was
though
she
could
not
comfort
him
by
telling
him
so
with
her
own
words
then
it
was
that
she
resolved
upon
writing
that
letter
he
should
already
have
what
little
comfort
she
might
administer
in
his
absence
now
listen
to
me
florence
he
is
a
thorough
reprobate
i
will
not
hear
him
so
called
he
is
no
reprobate
he
has
behaved
in
such
a
way
that
all
england
is
crying
out
about
him
he
has
done
that
which
will
never
allow
any
gentleman
to
speak
to
him
again
then
there
will
be
more
need
that
a
lady
should
do
so
but
it
is
not
true
you
put
your
knowledge
of
character
against
that
of
sir
magnus
sir
magnus
does
not
know
the
gentleman
i
do
what
the
good
of
talking
of
it
aunt
harry
annesley
has
my
word
and
nothing
on
earth
shall
induce
me
to
go
back
from
it
even
were
he
what
you
say
i
would
be
true
to
him
you
would
certainly
i
would
i
could
not
willingly
begin
to
love
a
man
whom
i
knew
to
be
base
but
when
i
had
loved
him
i
would
not
turn
because
of
his
baseness
i
could
do
it
it
would
be
a
great
a
terrible
misfortune
but
it
would
have
to
be
borne
but
here
i
know
all
the
story
to
which
you
allude
i
know
it
too
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
baseness
has
not
been
on
his
part
in
defence
of
my
name
he
has
been
silent
he
might
have
spoken
out
if
he
had
known
all
the
truth
then
i
was
as
much
his
own
then
as
i
am
now
one
of
these
days
i
suppose
i
shall
be
more
so
you
mean
to
marry
him
then
most
certainly
i
do
or
i
will
never
be
married
and
as
he
is
poor
now
and
i
must
have
my
own
money
when
i
am
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
wait
till
then
will
your
mother
word
go
for
nothing
with
you
poor
mamma
i
do
believe
that
mamma
is
very
unhappy
because
she
makes
me
unhappy
what
may
take
place
between
me
and
mamma
i
am
not
bound
i
think
to
tell
you
we
shall
be
away
soon
and
i
shall
be
left
to
mamma
alone
and
mamma
would
be
left
alone
to
her
daughter
lady
mountjoy
thought
the
visit
must
be
prolonged
so
that
at
last
anderson
might
be
enabled
to
prevail
the
visit
had
been
originally
intended
for
a
month
but
was
now
prolonged
indefinitely
after
that
conversation
between
lady
mountjoy
and
her
niece
two
or
three
things
happened
all
bearing
upon
our
story
florence
at
once
wrote
her
letter
if
things
were
going
badly
in
england
with
harry
annesley
harry
should
at
any
rate
have
the
comfort
of
knowing
what
were
her
feelings
if
there
might
be
comfort
to
him
in
that
perhaps
after
all
he
wo
mind
what
i
may
say
she
thought
to
herself
but
only
pretended
to
think
it
and
at
once
flatly
contradicted
her
own
perhaps
then
she
told
him
most
emphatically
not
to
reply
it
was
very
important
that
she
should
write
he
was
to
receive
her
letter
and
there
must
be
an
end
of
it
she
was
quite
sure
that
he
would
understand
her
he
would
not
subject
her
to
the
trouble
of
having
to
tell
her
own
people
that
she
was
maintaining
a
correspondence
for
it
would
amount
to
that
but
still
when
the
time
came
for
the
answer
she
had
counted
it
up
to
the
hour
and
when
sir
magnus
sent
for
her
and
handed
to
her
the
letter
having
discussed
that
question
with
her
mother
she
fully
expected
it
and
felt
properly
grateful
to
her
uncle
she
wanted
a
little
comfort
too
and
when
she
had
read
the
letter
she
knew
that
she
had
received
it
there
had
been
a
few
words
spoken
between
the
two
elder
ladies
after
the
interview
between
florence
and
lady
mountjoy
she
is
a
most
young
woman
said
lady
mountjoy
of
course
she
loves
her
lover
said
mountjoy
desirous
of
making
some
excuse
for
her
own
daughter
the
girl
was
very
troublesome
but
not
the
less
her
daughter
i
do
know
any
of
them
that
do
who
are
worth
anything
if
you
regard
it
in
that
light
sarah
she
get
the
better
of
you
if
she
marries
him
she
will
be
lost
that
is
the
way
you
have
got
to
look
at
it
it
is
her
future
happiness
you
must
think
of
and
respectability
she
is
a
headstrong
young
woman
and
has
to
be
treated
accordingly
what
would
you
do
i
would
be
very
severe
but
what
am
i
to
do
i
ca
beat
her
i
ca
lock
her
up
in
her
room
then
you
mean
to
give
it
up
no
i
do
you
should
be
so
cross
to
me
said
poor
mountjoy
when
it
had
reached
this
the
two
ladies
had
become
intimate
i
mean
to
give
it
up
at
all
but
what
am
i
to
do
remain
here
for
the
next
month
and
and
worry
her
let
anderson
have
his
chance
with
her
when
she
finds
that
everything
will
smile
with
her
if
she
accepts
him
and
that
her
life
will
be
made
a
burden
to
her
if
she
still
sticks
to
her
harry
annesley
she
come
round
if
she
be
like
other
girls
of
course
a
girl
ca
be
made
to
marry
a
man
but
there
are
ways
and
means
by
this
lady
mountjoy
meant
that
the
utmost
cruelty
should
be
used
which
would
be
compatible
with
a
good
breakfast
dinner
and
bedroom
now
mountjoy
knew
herself
to
be
incapable
of
this
and
knew
also
or
thought
that
she
knew
that
it
would
not
be
efficacious
you
stay
here
up
to
christmas
if
you
like
it
said
sir
magnus
to
his
she
ca
but
see
anderson
every
day
and
that
goes
a
long
way
she
of
course
puts
on
a
resolute
air
as
well
as
she
can
they
all
know
how
to
do
that
do
you
be
resolute
in
return
the
deuce
is
in
it
if
we
ca
have
our
way
with
her
among
us
when
you
talk
of
ill
usage
nobody
wants
you
to
put
her
in
chains
there
are
different
ways
of
killing
a
cat
you
get
friends
to
write
to
you
from
england
about
young
annesley
and
i
do
the
same
the
truth
of
course
i
mean
nothing
can
be
worse
than
the
truth
said
mountjoy
shaking
her
head
sorrowfully
just
so
said
sir
magnus
who
was
not
at
all
sorrowful
to
hear
so
bad
an
account
of
the
favored
suitor
then
we
read
her
the
letters
she
ca
help
hearing
them
just
the
true
facts
you
know
that
fair
nobody
can
call
that
cruel
and
then
when
she
breaks
down
and
comes
to
our
call
we
all
be
as
soft
as
mother
milk
to
her
i
shall
see
her
going
about
the
boulevards
with
a
pair
of
ponies
yet
mountjoy
felt
that
when
sir
magnus
spoke
of
florence
coming
to
his
call
he
did
not
know
her
daughter
but
she
had
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
obey
sir
magnus
therefore
she
resolved
to
stay
at
brussels
another
period
of
six
weeks
and
told
florence
that
she
had
so
resolved
just
at
present
brussels
and
cheltenham
would
be
all
the
same
to
florence
it
will
be
a
dreadful
bore
having
them
so
long
said
poor
lady
mountjoy
piteously
to
her
husband
for
in
the
presence
of
sir
magnus
she
was
by
no
means
the
valiant
woman
that
she
was
with
some
of
her
friends
you
find
everything
a
bore
what
the
trouble
what
am
i
to
do
with
them
take
about
in
the
carriage
lord
bless
my
soul
what
have
you
got
a
carriage
for
then
with
miss
abbott
there
never
room
for
any
one
else
leave
miss
abbott
at
home
then
what
the
good
of
talking
to
me
about
miss
abbott
i
suppose
it
does
matter
to
you
whom
my
daughter
marries
lady
mountjoy
did
not
think
that
it
did
matter
much
but
she
declared
that
she
had
already
evinced
the
most
tender
solicitude
then
stick
to
it
the
girl
does
want
to
go
out
every
day
leave
her
alone
where
anderson
can
get
at
her
he
always
out
riding
with
you
no
he
not
not
always
and
leave
miss
abbott
at
home
then
be
room
for
two
others
do
make
difficulties
anderson
will
expect
that
i
shall
do
something
for
him
of
course
because
of
the
money
said
lady
mountjoy
whispering
and
i
got
to
do
something
for
her
too
now
there
was
a
spice
of
honesty
about
sir
magnus
he
knew
that
as
he
could
not
at
once
pay
back
these
sums
he
was
bound
to
make
it
up
in
some
other
way
the
debts
would
be
left
the
same
but
that
would
remain
with
providence
then
came
harry
letter
and
there
was
a
deep
consultation
it
was
known
to
have
come
from
harry
by
the
buntingford
mountjoy
proposed
to
consult
lady
mountjoy
but
to
that
sir
magnus
would
not
agree
she
take
her
skin
off
her
if
she
could
now
that
angered
said
the
lady
husband
who
no
doubt
knew
the
lady
well
of
course
she
learn
that
the
letter
has
been
written
and
then
throw
it
in
our
teeth
she
would
believe
that
it
had
gone
astray
in
coming
here
we
should
give
her
a
sort
of
a
over
us
so
it
was
decided
that
florence
should
have
her
letter
chapter
xxxi
florence
request
thus
it
was
arranged
that
florence
should
be
left
in
anderson
way
anderson
as
sir
magnus
had
said
was
not
always
out
riding
there
were
moments
in
which
even
he
was
off
duty
and
sir
magnus
contrived
to
ride
a
little
earlier
than
usual
so
that
he
should
get
back
while
the
carriage
was
still
out
on
its
rounds
lady
mountjoy
certainly
did
her
duty
taking
mountjoy
with
her
daily
and
generally
miss
abbott
so
that
florence
was
as
it
were
left
to
the
mercies
of
anderson
she
could
of
course
shut
herself
up
in
her
bedroom
but
things
had
not
as
yet
become
so
bad
as
that
anderson
had
not
made
himself
terrible
to
her
she
did
not
in
truth
fear
anderson
at
all
who
was
courteous
in
his
manner
and
complimentary
in
his
language
and
she
came
at
this
time
to
the
conclusion
that
if
anderson
continued
his
pursuit
of
her
she
would
tell
him
the
exact
truth
of
the
case
as
a
gentleman
and
as
a
young
man
she
thought
that
he
would
sympathize
with
her
the
one
enemy
whom
she
did
dread
was
lady
mountjoy
she
too
had
felt
that
her
aunt
could
take
her
skin
off
her
as
sir
magnus
had
said
she
had
not
heard
the
words
but
she
knew
that
it
was
so
and
her
dislike
to
lady
mountjoy
was
in
proportion
it
can
not
be
said
that
she
was
afraid
she
did
not
intend
to
leave
her
skin
in
her
aunt
hands
for
every
inch
of
skin
taken
she
resolved
to
have
an
inch
in
return
she
was
not
acquainted
with
the
expressive
mode
of
language
which
sir
magnus
had
adopted
but
she
was
prepared
for
all
such
attacks
for
sir
magnus
himself
since
he
had
given
up
the
letter
to
her
she
did
feel
some
regard
behind
the
british
minister
house
which
though
entitled
to
no
such
name
was
generally
called
the
embassy
there
was
a
large
garden
which
though
not
much
used
by
sir
magnus
or
lady
mountjoy
was
regarded
as
a
valuable
adjunct
to
the
establishment
here
florence
betook
herself
for
exercise
and
here
anderson
having
put
off
the
muddy
marks
of
his
riding
found
her
one
afternoon
it
must
be
understood
that
no
young
man
was
ever
more
in
earnest
than
anderson
he
too
looking
through
the
glass
which
had
been
prepared
for
him
by
sir
magnus
thought
that
he
saw
in
the
not
very
far
distant
future
a
hugh
anderson
driving
a
pair
of
gray
ponies
along
the
boulevard
and
he
was
much
pleased
with
the
sight
it
reached
to
the
top
of
his
ambition
florence
was
to
his
eyes
really
the
sort
of
a
girl
whom
a
man
in
his
position
ought
to
marry
a
secretary
of
legation
in
a
small
foreign
capital
can
not
do
with
a
dowdy
wife
as
may
a
clerk
for
instance
in
the
foreign
office
a
secretary
of
legation
the
second
secretary
he
told
himself
was
bound
if
he
married
at
all
to
have
a
pretty
and
wife
he
knew
all
about
the
intricacies
which
had
fallen
in
a
peculiar
way
into
his
own
hand
blow
might
have
married
a
south
sea
islander
and
would
have
been
none
the
worse
as
regarded
his
official
duties
blow
did
not
want
the
services
of
a
wife
in
discovering
and
reporting
all
the
secrets
of
the
belgium
iron
trade
there
was
no
intricacy
in
that
no
nicety
there
was
much
of
what
in
his
lighter
moments
anderson
called
sweat
he
did
not
pretend
to
much
capacity
for
such
duties
but
in
his
own
peculiar
walk
he
thought
that
he
was
great
but
it
was
very
fatiguing
and
he
was
sure
that
a
wife
was
necessary
to
him
there
were
little
niceties
which
none
but
a
wife
could
perform
he
had
a
great
esteem
for
sir
magnus
sir
magnus
was
well
thought
of
by
all
the
court
and
by
the
foreign
minister
at
brussels
but
lady
mountjoy
was
really
of
no
use
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
it
all
with
her
was
to
show
herself
in
a
carriage
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
anderson
to
marry
he
was
loving
enough
and
very
susceptible
he
was
too
susceptible
and
he
knew
his
own
fault
and
he
was
always
on
guard
against
it
as
behooved
a
young
man
with
such
duties
as
his
he
was
always
falling
in
love
and
then
using
his
diplomatic
skill
in
avoiding
the
consequences
he
had
found
out
that
though
one
girl
had
looked
so
well
under
waxlight
she
did
not
endure
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
day
another
could
not
be
always
graceful
or
though
she
could
talk
well
enough
during
a
waltz
she
had
nothing
to
say
for
herself
at
three
in
the
morning
and
he
was
driven
to
calculate
that
he
would
be
wrong
to
marry
a
girl
without
a
shilling
it
is
a
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
can
not
afford
to
do
unless
he
sure
of
his
position
he
had
said
on
such
an
occasion
to
montgomery
arbuthnot
alluding
especially
to
his
brother
state
of
health
when
anderson
spoke
of
not
being
sure
of
his
position
he
was
always
considered
to
allude
to
his
brother
health
in
this
way
he
had
nearly
got
his
little
boat
on
to
the
rocks
more
than
once
and
had
given
some
trouble
to
sir
magnus
but
now
he
was
quite
sure
it
all
there
all
round
he
had
said
to
arbuthnot
more
than
once
arbuthnot
said
that
it
was
there
all
round
all
round
waxlight
and
daylight
made
no
difference
to
her
she
was
always
graceful
nobody
with
an
eye
in
his
head
can
doubt
that
said
anderson
i
should
think
not
by
jove
replied
arbuthnot
and
for
talking
you
never
catch
her
out
never
i
never
did
certainly
said
arbuthnot
who
as
third
secretary
was
obedient
and
and
then
look
at
her
money
of
course
a
fellow
wants
something
to
help
him
on
my
position
is
so
uncertain
that
i
can
not
do
without
it
of
course
not
now
with
some
girls
it
so
deuced
hard
to
find
out
you
hear
that
a
girl
has
got
money
but
when
the
time
comes
it
depends
on
the
life
of
a
father
who
does
think
of
dying
damme
does
think
of
it
those
fellows
never
do
said
arbuthnot
but
here
you
see
i
know
all
about
it
when
she
only
she
have
ten
thousand
pounds
of
her
own
i
hate
a
mercenary
fellow
oh
yes
beastly
nobody
can
say
that
of
me
circumstanced
as
i
am
i
want
something
to
help
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
she
has
got
it
quite
as
much
as
i
want
quite
and
i
know
all
about
it
without
the
slightest
doubt
in
the
world
for
the
small
loan
of
fifteen
hundred
pounds
sir
magnus
paid
the
full
value
of
the
interest
and
deficient
security
sir
magnus
tells
me
that
if
i
only
stick
to
her
i
shall
be
sure
to
win
there
some
fellow
in
england
has
just
touched
her
heart
just
touched
it
you
know
i
understand
said
arbuthnot
looking
very
wise
he
is
not
a
fellow
of
very
much
account
said
anderson
one
of
those
handsome
fellows
without
conduct
and
without
courage
i
known
lots
of
said
arbuthnot
his
name
is
annesley
said
anderson
i
never
saw
him
in
my
life
but
that
what
sir
magnus
says
he
has
done
something
awfully
disreputable
i
do
quite
understand
what
it
is
but
something
which
ought
to
make
him
unfit
to
be
her
husband
nobody
knows
the
world
better
than
sir
magnus
and
he
says
that
it
is
so
nobody
does
know
the
world
better
than
sir
magnus
said
arbuthnot
and
so
that
conversation
was
brought
to
an
end
one
day
soon
after
this
he
caught
her
walking
in
the
garden
her
mother
and
miss
abbot
were
still
out
with
lady
mountjoy
in
the
carriage
and
sir
magnus
had
retired
after
the
fatigue
of
his
ride
to
sleep
for
half
an
hour
before
dinner
all
alone
miss
mountjoy
he
said
yes
alone
anderson
i
never
in
better
company
so
i
think
but
then
if
i
were
here
you
would
be
all
alone
would
you
not
if
you
were
with
me
that
what
i
mean
but
yet
two
people
may
be
alone
as
regards
the
world
at
large
may
they
i
do
understand
the
nicety
of
language
well
enough
to
say
we
used
to
have
a
question
among
us
when
we
were
children
whether
a
wild
beast
could
howl
in
an
empty
cavern
it
the
same
sort
of
thing
why
should
he
because
the
cavern
would
not
be
empty
if
the
wild
beast
were
in
it
did
you
ever
see
a
girl
bang
an
egg
against
a
wall
in
a
stocking
and
then
look
awfully
surprised
because
she
had
smashed
it
i
do
understand
the
joke
she
had
been
told
she
could
break
an
egg
in
an
empty
stocking
then
she
was
made
to
look
in
and
there
was
the
broken
egg
for
her
pains
i
do
know
what
made
me
tell
you
that
story
it
a
very
good
story
i
get
miss
abbott
to
do
it
she
believes
everything
and
everybody
then
she
a
happy
woman
i
wish
you
believe
everybody
so
i
do
nearly
everybody
there
are
some
inveterate
liars
whom
nobody
can
believe
i
hope
i
am
not
regarded
as
one
you
certainly
not
if
anybody
were
to
speak
of
you
as
such
behind
your
back
no
one
would
take
your
part
more
loyally
than
i
but
nobody
would
that
something
at
any
rate
then
you
do
believe
that
i
love
you
i
believe
that
you
think
so
and
that
i
do
know
my
own
heart
that
very
common
anderson
i
was
quite
sure
of
my
own
heart
twelve
months
ago
but
i
know
it
now
he
felt
that
his
hopes
ran
very
low
when
this
was
said
she
had
never
before
spoken
to
him
of
his
rival
nor
had
he
to
her
he
knew
or
fancied
that
he
knew
that
her
heart
had
been
touched
as
he
had
said
to
arbuthnot
but
the
touch
must
have
been
very
deep
if
she
felt
herself
constrained
to
speak
to
him
on
the
subject
it
had
been
his
desire
to
pass
over
annesley
and
never
to
hear
the
name
mentioned
between
them
you
were
speaking
of
your
own
heart
well
i
was
no
doubt
it
is
a
silly
thing
to
talk
of
i
dare
say
i
going
to
tell
you
of
my
heart
and
i
hope
you
wo
think
it
silly
i
do
so
because
i
believe
you
to
be
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honor
he
blushed
at
the
words
and
the
tone
in
which
they
were
spoken
but
his
heart
fell
still
lower
anderson
i
am
engaged
here
she
paused
a
moment
but
he
had
nothing
to
say
i
am
engaged
to
marry
a
gentleman
whom
i
love
with
all
my
heart
and
all
my
strength
and
all
my
body
i
love
him
so
that
nothing
can
ever
separate
me
from
him
or
at
least
from
the
thoughts
of
him
as
regards
all
the
interests
of
life
i
feel
as
though
i
were
already
his
wife
if
i
ever
marry
any
man
i
swear
to
you
that
it
will
be
him
then
anderson
felt
that
all
hope
had
utterly
departed
from
him
she
had
said
that
she
believed
him
to
be
a
man
of
truth
he
certainly
believed
her
to
be
a
woman
he
asked
himself
and
he
found
it
to
be
quite
impossible
to
doubt
her
word
on
this
subject
now
i
will
go
on
and
tell
you
my
troubles
my
mother
disapproves
of
the
man
sir
magnus
has
taken
upon
himself
to
disapprove
and
lady
mountjoy
disapproves
especially
i
do
care
two
straws
about
sir
magnus
and
lady
mountjoy
as
to
lady
mountjoy
it
is
simply
an
impertinence
on
her
part
interfering
with
me
there
was
something
in
her
face
as
she
said
this
which
made
anderson
feel
that
if
he
could
only
succeed
in
having
her
and
the
pair
of
ponies
he
would
be
a
prouder
man
than
the
ambassador
at
paris
but
he
knew
that
it
was
hopeless
as
to
my
mother
that
is
indeed
a
sorrow
she
has
been
to
me
the
dearest
mother
putting
her
only
hopes
of
happiness
in
me
no
mother
was
ever
more
devoted
to
a
child
and
of
all
children
i
should
be
the
most
ungrateful
were
i
to
turn
against
her
but
from
my
early
years
she
has
wished
me
to
marry
a
man
whom
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
love
you
have
heard
of
captain
scarborough
the
man
who
disappeared
he
was
and
is
my
first
cousin
he
is
in
some
way
connected
with
sir
magnus
through
mamma
mamma
is
aunt
to
captain
scarborough
and
she
married
the
brother
of
sir
magnus
well
he
has
disappeared
and
been
disinherited
i
can
not
explain
all
about
it
for
i
do
understand
it
but
he
has
come
to
great
trouble
it
was
not
on
that
account
that
i
would
not
marry
him
it
was
partly
because
i
did
not
like
him
and
partly
because
of
harry
annesley
i
will
tell
you
everything
because
i
want
you
to
know
my
story
but
my
mother
has
disliked
annesley
because
she
has
thought
that
he
has
interfered
with
my
cousin
i
understand
all
that
and
she
has
been
taught
to
think
that
annesley
has
behaved
very
badly
i
can
not
quite
explain
it
because
there
is
a
brother
of
captain
scarborough
who
has
interfered
i
never
loved
captain
scarborough
but
that
man
i
hate
he
has
spread
those
stories
captain
scarborough
has
disappeared
but
before
he
went
he
thought
it
well
to
revenge
himself
on
annesley
he
attacked
him
in
the
street
late
at
night
and
endeavored
to
beat
him
but
why
why
indeed
that
such
a
trumpery
cause
as
a
girl
love
should
operate
with
such
a
man
i
can
understand
it
oh
yes
i
can
understand
it
i
believe
he
was
tipsy
and
he
had
been
gambling
and
had
lost
all
his
money
more
than
all
his
money
he
was
a
ruined
man
and
reckless
and
wretched
i
can
forgive
him
and
so
does
harry
but
in
the
struggle
harry
got
the
best
of
it
and
left
him
there
in
the
street
no
weapons
had
been
used
except
that
captain
scarborough
had
a
stick
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
him
hurt
nor
was
he
much
hurt
he
had
behaved
very
badly
and
harry
left
him
had
he
gone
for
a
policeman
he
could
only
have
given
him
in
charge
the
man
was
not
hurt
and
seems
to
have
walked
away
the
papers
were
full
of
it
yes
the
papers
were
full
of
it
because
he
was
missing
i
do
know
yet
what
became
of
him
but
i
have
my
suspicions
they
say
that
he
has
been
seen
at
monaco
very
likely
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
though
he
was
my
cousin
i
am
touched
nearer
in
another
place
young
scarborough
who
i
suspect
knows
all
about
his
brother
took
upon
himself
to
annesley
annesley
did
not
care
to
tell
anything
of
that
struggle
in
the
streets
and
denied
that
he
had
seen
him
in
truth
he
did
not
want
to
have
my
name
mentioned
my
belief
is
that
augustus
scarborough
knew
exactly
what
had
taken
place
when
he
asked
the
question
it
was
he
who
really
was
false
but
he
is
now
the
heir
to
tretton
and
a
great
man
in
his
way
and
in
order
to
injure
harry
annesley
he
has
spread
abroad
the
story
which
they
all
tell
here
but
why
he
does
that
is
all
i
know
but
i
will
not
be
a
hypocrite
he
chose
to
wish
that
i
should
not
marry
harry
annesley
i
can
not
tell
you
farther
than
that
but
he
has
persuaded
mamma
and
has
told
every
one
he
shall
never
persuade
me
everybody
seems
to
believe
him
said
anderson
not
as
intending
to
say
that
he
believed
him
now
but
that
he
had
done
so
of
course
they
do
he
has
simply
ruined
harry
he
too
has
been
disinherited
now
i
do
know
how
they
do
these
things
but
it
has
been
done
his
uncle
has
been
turned
against
him
and
his
whole
income
has
been
taken
from
him
but
they
will
never
persuade
me
nor
if
they
did
would
i
be
untrue
to
him
it
is
a
grand
thing
for
a
girl
to
have
a
perfect
faith
in
the
man
she
has
to
marry
as
i
have
as
i
have
i
know
my
man
and
will
as
soon
disbelieve
in
heaven
as
in
him
but
were
he
what
they
say
he
is
he
would
still
have
to
become
my
husband
i
should
be
but
i
should
still
be
true
thank
god
though
thank
god
he
has
done
nothing
and
will
do
nothing
to
make
me
ashamed
of
him
now
you
know
my
story
yes
now
i
know
it
the
tears
came
very
near
the
poor
man
eyes
as
he
answered
and
what
will
you
do
for
me
what
shall
i
do
yes
what
will
you
do
i
have
told
you
all
my
story
believing
you
to
be
a
gentleman
you
have
entertained
a
fancy
which
has
been
encouraged
by
sir
magnus
will
you
promise
me
not
to
speak
to
me
of
it
again
will
you
relieve
me
of
so
much
of
my
trouble
will
you
will
you
then
when
he
turned
away
she
followed
him
and
put
both
her
hands
upon
his
arm
will
you
do
that
little
thing
for
me
a
little
thing
is
it
not
a
little
thing
when
i
am
so
bound
to
that
other
man
that
nothing
can
move
me
whether
it
be
little
or
whether
it
be
much
will
you
not
do
it
she
still
held
him
by
the
arm
but
his
face
was
turned
from
her
so
that
she
could
not
see
it
the
tears
absolute
tears
were
running
down
his
cheeks
what
did
it
behoove
him
as
a
man
to
do
was
he
to
believe
her
vows
now
and
grant
her
request
and
was
she
then
to
give
herself
to
some
third
person
and
forget
harry
annesley
altogether
how
would
it
be
with
him
then
a
faint
heart
never
won
a
fair
lady
all
is
fair
in
love
and
war
you
can
not
catch
cherries
by
holding
your
mouth
open
a
great
amount
of
wisdom
such
as
this
came
to
him
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
but
there
was
her
hand
upon
his
arm
and
he
could
not
elude
her
request
will
you
not
do
it
for
me
she
asked
again
i
will
he
said
still
keeping
his
face
turned
away
i
knew
it
i
knew
you
would
you
are
and
honest
and
can
not
be
cruel
to
a
poor
girl
and
if
in
time
to
come
when
i
am
harry
annesley
wife
we
shall
chance
to
meet
each
other
as
we
will
he
shall
thank
you
i
shall
not
want
that
what
will
his
thanks
do
for
me
you
do
not
think
that
i
shall
be
silent
to
oblige
him
then
he
walked
forth
from
out
of
the
garden
and
she
had
never
seen
his
tears
but
she
knew
well
that
he
was
weeping
and
she
sympathized
with
him
chapter
xxxii
anderson
is
ill
when
they
went
down
to
dinner
that
day
it
became
known
that
anderson
did
not
intend
to
dine
with
them
he
got
a
headache
said
sir
magnus
he
says
he
got
a
headache
i
never
knew
such
a
thing
in
my
life
before
it
was
quite
clear
that
sir
magnus
did
not
think
that
his
lieutenant
ought
to
have
such
a
headache
as
would
prevent
his
coming
to
dinner
and
that
he
did
not
quite
believe
in
the
headache
there
was
a
dinner
ready
a
very
good
dinner
which
it
was
his
business
to
provide
he
always
did
provide
it
and
took
a
great
deal
of
trouble
to
see
that
it
was
good
there
is
a
table
so
well
kept
in
all
brussels
he
used
to
boast
but
when
he
had
done
his
share
he
expected
that
anderson
and
arbuthnot
should
do
theirs
especially
anderson
there
had
been
sometimes
a
few
words
not
quite
a
quarrel
but
nearly
so
on
the
subject
of
dining
out
sir
magnus
only
dined
out
with
royalty
cabinet
ministers
and
other
diplomats
even
then
he
rarely
got
a
good
dinner
what
he
called
a
good
dinner
he
often
took
anderson
with
him
he
was
the
among
the
diplomats
in
brussels
and
a
little
indulgence
was
shown
to
him
therefore
he
thought
that
anderson
should
be
as
true
to
him
as
was
he
to
anderson
it
was
not
for
anderson
sake
indeed
who
felt
the
bondage
to
be
irksome
and
sir
magnus
knew
that
his
subordinate
sometimes
groaned
in
spirit
but
a
good
dinner
is
a
good
dinner
especially
the
best
dinner
in
brussels
and
sir
magnus
felt
that
something
ought
to
be
given
in
return
he
had
not
that
perfect
faith
in
mankind
which
is
the
surest
evidence
of
a
simple
mind
ideas
crowded
upon
him
had
anderson
a
snug
little
just
two
or
three
friends
in
his
own
room
sir
magnus
would
not
have
been
very
angry
he
was
rarely
very
angry
but
he
should
like
to
show
his
cleverness
by
finding
it
out
anderson
had
been
quite
well
when
he
was
out
riding
and
he
did
not
remember
him
ever
before
to
have
had
a
headache
is
he
very
bad
arbuthnot
i
have
seen
him
sir
since
he
was
riding
who
has
seen
him
he
was
in
the
garden
with
me
said
florence
boldly
i
suppose
that
did
not
give
him
a
headache
not
that
i
perceived
it
is
very
singular
that
he
should
have
a
headache
just
when
dinner
is
ready
continued
sir
magnus
you
had
better
leave
the
young
man
alone
said
lady
mountjoy
and
one
who
knew
the
ways
of
living
at
the
british
embassy
would
be
sure
that
after
this
sir
magnus
would
not
leave
the
young
man
alone
his
nature
was
not
simple
it
seemed
to
him
again
that
there
might
be
a
little
and
that
lady
mountjoy
knew
all
about
it
richard
he
said
to
the
butler
go
into
anderson
room
and
see
if
he
is
very
bad
richard
came
back
and
whispered
to
the
great
man
that
anderson
was
not
in
his
room
this
is
very
remarkable
a
bad
headache
and
not
in
his
room
where
is
he
i
insist
on
knowing
where
anderson
is
you
had
better
leave
him
alone
said
lady
mountjoy
leave
a
man
alone
because
he
ill
he
might
die
shall
i
go
and
see
said
arbuthnot
i
wish
you
would
and
bring
him
in
here
if
he
well
enough
to
show
i
do
approve
of
a
young
man
going
without
his
dinner
there
nothing
so
bad
he
be
sure
to
get
something
sir
magnus
said
lady
mountjoy
but
sir
magnus
insisted
that
arbuthnot
should
go
and
look
after
his
friend
it
was
now
november
and
at
eight
was
quite
dark
but
the
weather
was
fine
and
something
of
the
mildness
of
autumn
remained
arbuthnot
was
not
long
in
discovering
that
anderson
was
again
walking
in
the
garden
he
had
left
florence
there
and
had
gone
to
the
house
but
had
found
himself
to
be
utterly
desolate
and
miserable
she
had
exacted
from
him
a
promise
which
was
not
compatible
with
any
kind
of
happiness
to
which
he
could
now
look
forward
in
the
first
place
all
brussels
knew
that
he
had
been
in
love
with
florence
mountjoy
he
thought
that
all
brussels
knew
it
and
they
knew
that
he
had
been
in
earnest
in
this
love
he
did
believe
that
all
brussels
had
given
him
credit
for
so
much
and
now
they
would
know
that
he
had
suddenly
ceased
to
make
love
it
might
be
that
this
should
be
attributed
to
gallantry
on
his
part
that
it
should
be
considered
that
the
lady
had
been
deserted
but
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
not
so
good
a
hypocrite
as
not
to
show
that
he
was
he
was
quite
sure
that
it
would
be
seen
that
he
had
got
the
worst
of
it
but
when
he
asked
himself
questions
as
to
his
own
condition
he
told
himself
that
there
was
suffering
in
store
for
him
more
heavy
to
bear
than
these
there
could
be
no
ponies
with
florence
driving
them
and
a
boy
in
his
own
livery
behind
seen
upon
the
boulevards
that
vision
was
gone
and
forever
and
then
came
upon
him
an
idea
that
the
absence
of
the
girl
from
other
portions
of
his
life
might
touch
him
more
nearly
he
did
feel
something
like
actual
love
and
the
more
she
had
told
him
of
her
devotion
to
harry
annesley
the
more
strongly
he
had
felt
the
value
of
that
devotion
why
should
this
man
have
it
and
not
he
he
had
not
been
disinherited
he
had
not
been
knocked
about
in
a
street
quarrel
he
had
not
been
driven
to
tell
a
lie
as
to
his
having
not
seen
a
man
when
he
had
in
truth
knocked
him
down
he
had
quite
agreed
with
florence
that
harry
was
justified
in
the
lie
but
there
was
nothing
in
it
to
make
the
girl
love
him
the
better
for
it
and
then
looking
forward
he
could
perceive
the
possibility
of
an
event
which
if
it
should
occur
would
cover
him
with
confusion
and
disgrace
if
after
all
florence
were
to
take
not
harry
annesley
but
somebody
else
how
foolish
how
credulous
how
vain
would
he
have
been
then
to
have
made
the
promise
girls
did
such
things
every
day
he
had
promised
and
he
thought
that
he
must
keep
his
promise
but
she
would
be
bound
by
no
promise
as
he
thought
of
it
he
reflected
that
he
might
even
yet
exact
such
a
promise
from
her
but
when
the
came
he
really
was
sick
with
love
or
sick
with
disappointment
he
felt
that
he
could
not
eat
his
dinner
under
the
battery
of
raillery
which
was
always
coming
from
sir
magnus
and
therefore
he
had
told
the
servants
that
as
the
evening
progressed
he
would
have
something
to
eat
in
his
own
room
and
then
he
went
out
to
wander
in
the
dusk
beneath
the
trees
in
the
garden
here
he
was
encountered
by
arbuthnot
with
his
dress
boots
and
white
cravat
what
the
mischief
are
you
doing
here
old
fellow
i
not
very
well
i
have
an
awfully
bilious
headache
sir
magnus
is
kicking
up
a
deuce
of
a
row
because
you
not
there
sir
magnus
be
blowed
how
am
i
to
be
there
if
i
got
a
bilious
headache
i
not
dressed
i
could
not
have
dressed
myself
for
a
note
could
you
now
shall
i
go
back
and
tell
him
that
but
you
must
have
something
to
eat
i
do
know
what
up
but
sir
magnus
is
in
a
taking
he
always
in
a
taking
i
sometimes
think
he
the
biggest
fool
out
and
there
the
place
kept
vacant
next
to
miss
mountjoy
grascour
wanted
to
sit
there
but
her
ladyship
would
let
him
and
i
sat
next
miss
abbott
because
i
did
want
to
be
in
your
way
tell
grascour
to
go
and
sit
there
or
you
may
do
so
it
all
nothing
to
me
this
he
said
in
the
bitterness
of
his
heart
by
no
means
intending
to
tell
his
secret
but
unable
to
keep
it
within
his
own
bosom
what
the
matter
anderson
asked
the
other
piteously
i
am
clean
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
know
you
a
good
fellow
and
i
tell
you
everything
it
all
over
all
over
with
miss
mountjoy
then
anderson
began
to
tell
the
whole
story
but
before
he
had
got
half
through
or
a
quarter
through
another
message
came
from
sir
magnus
sir
magnus
is
becoming
very
angry
indeed
whispered
the
butler
he
says
that
arbuthnot
is
to
go
back
i
better
go
or
i
shall
catch
it
what
up
with
him
richard
asked
anderson
well
if
you
ask
me
anderson
i
think
he
of
something
what
does
he
suspect
i
think
he
that
perhaps
you
are
having
a
jolly
time
of
it
richard
had
known
his
master
many
years
and
could
almost
read
his
inmost
thoughts
i
do
say
as
it
so
but
that
what
i
am
thinking
you
tell
him
i
ai
you
tell
him
i
a
bad
bilious
headache
and
that
the
air
in
the
garden
does
it
good
you
tell
him
that
i
mean
to
have
something
to
eat
when
my
head
is
better
and
do
you
mind
and
let
me
have
it
and
a
bottle
of
claret
with
this
the
butler
went
back
and
so
did
arbuthnot
after
asking
one
other
question
i
so
sorry
it
is
all
serene
with
miss
mountjoy
it
is
then
do
mind
now
but
it
is
serene
do
say
a
word
about
her
but
she
has
done
me
i
think
i
shall
get
leave
of
absence
and
go
away
for
two
months
you
have
to
do
all
the
riding
old
fellow
i
shall
go
but
i
do
know
where
i
shall
go
you
return
to
them
now
and
tell
them
i
such
a
bilious
headache
i
do
know
which
way
to
turn
myself
arbuthnot
went
back
and
found
sir
magnus
quarrelling
grievously
with
the
butler
i
do
think
he
doing
anything
as
he
should
the
butler
whispered
having
seen
into
his
master
mind
what
do
you
mean
by
that
do
let
the
matter
drop
said
lady
mountjoy
who
had
also
seen
into
her
husband
mind
and
saw
moreover
that
the
butler
had
done
so
a
young
man
dinner
is
worth
all
this
bother
i
wo
let
the
matter
drop
what
does
he
mean
when
he
says
that
he
is
doing
anything
that
he
should
i
never
said
anything
about
what
he
was
doing
he
is
dressed
sir
magnus
he
finds
himself
a
little
better
now
and
means
to
have
something
then
there
came
an
awful
silence
during
which
the
dinner
was
eaten
sir
magnus
knew
nothing
of
the
truth
simply
suspecting
the
headache
to
be
a
myth
lady
mountjoy
with
a
woman
quickness
thought
that
there
had
been
some
words
between
florence
and
her
late
lover
and
as
she
disliked
florence
was
inclined
to
throw
all
the
blame
upon
her
a
word
had
been
said
to
mountjoy
i
do
think
he
trouble
me
any
more
mamma
which
mountjoy
did
not
quite
understand
but
which
she
connected
with
the
young
man
absence
but
florence
understood
it
all
and
liked
anderson
the
better
could
it
really
be
that
for
love
of
her
he
would
lose
his
dinner
could
it
be
that
he
was
so
grievously
afflicted
at
the
loss
of
a
girl
heart
there
he
was
walking
out
in
the
dark
and
the
cold
all
because
she
loved
harry
annesley
so
well
that
there
could
be
no
chance
for
him
girls
believe
so
little
in
the
truth
of
the
love
of
men
that
any
sign
of
its
reality
touches
them
to
the
core
poor
hugh
anderson
a
tear
came
into
her
eye
as
she
thought
that
he
was
wandering
there
in
the
dark
and
all
for
the
love
of
her
the
rest
of
the
dinner
passed
away
in
silence
and
sir
magnus
hardly
became
cordial
and
communicative
with
grascour
even
under
the
influence
of
his
wine
on
the
next
morning
just
before
lunch
florence
was
waylaid
by
anderson
as
she
was
passing
along
one
of
the
passages
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
miss
mountjoy
he
said
i
want
to
ask
from
your
great
goodness
the
indulgence
of
a
few
words
certainly
could
you
come
into
the
garden
if
you
will
give
me
time
to
go
and
change
my
boots
and
get
a
shawl
we
ladies
are
not
ready
to
go
out
always
as
are
you
gentlemen
anywhere
will
do
come
in
here
and
he
led
the
way
into
a
small
parlor
which
was
not
often
used
i
was
so
sorry
to
hear
last
night
that
you
were
unwell
mr
anderson
i
was
not
very
well
certainly
after
what
i
had
heard
before
dinner
he
did
not
tell
her
that
he
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
drink
a
bottle
of
claret
and
to
smoke
a
couple
of
cigars
in
his
bedroom
of
course
you
remember
what
took
place
yesterday
remember
oh
yes
i
shall
not
readily
forget
it
i
made
you
a
promise
you
did
very
kindly
and
i
mean
to
keep
it
i
sure
you
do
because
you
a
gentleman
i
do
think
i
ought
to
have
made
it
oh
mr
anderson
i
do
think
i
ought
see
what
i
am
giving
up
nothing
except
the
privilege
of
troubling
me
but
if
it
should
be
something
else
do
not
be
angry
with
me
but
loving
you
as
i
do
of
course
my
mind
is
full
of
it
i
have
promised
and
must
be
dumb
and
i
shall
be
spared
great
vexation
but
suppose
i
were
to
hear
that
in
six
months
time
you
had
married
some
one
else
annesley
you
mean
not
in
six
months
somebody
else
not
mr
annesley
there
is
nobody
else
but
there
might
be
it
is
impossible
after
all
that
i
told
you
do
not
you
understand
but
if
there
were
the
poor
man
as
he
made
the
suggestion
looked
very
piteous
if
there
were
i
think
you
should
promise
me
i
shall
be
that
somebody
else
that
would
be
no
more
than
fair
she
paused
a
moment
to
think
frowning
the
while
certainly
not
certainly
not
i
can
make
no
such
promise
nor
should
you
ask
it
i
am
to
promise
that
under
certain
circumstances
i
would
become
your
wife
when
i
know
that
under
no
circumstances
i
would
do
so
under
no
circumstances
under
none
what
would
you
have
me
say
anderson
supposing
yourself
engaged
to
marry
a
girl
i
wish
i
were
to
you
to
a
girl
who
loved
you
and
whom
you
loved
there
no
doubt
about
my
loving
her
you
can
follow
my
meaning
and
i
wish
that
you
would
do
so
what
would
you
think
if
you
were
to
hear
that
she
had
promised
to
marry
some
one
else
in
the
event
of
your
deserting
her
it
is
out
of
the
question
i
mean
to
be
the
wife
of
harry
annesley
say
that
it
is
not
to
be
so
and
you
will
simply
destroy
me
of
one
thing
i
may
be
sure
that
i
will
marry
him
or
nobody
you
promised
me
not
because
your
promise
was
necessary
for
that
but
to
spare
me
from
trouble
till
that
time
shall
come
and
i
am
grateful
very
grateful
then
she
left
him
suffering
from
another
headache
was
there
anything
said
between
you
and
anderson
yesterday
her
aunt
inquired
that
afternoon
why
do
you
ask
because
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
know
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
anderson
has
at
any
rate
your
permission
to
say
what
he
likes
to
me
but
i
am
not
on
that
account
bound
to
tell
you
all
that
he
does
say
but
i
will
tell
you
he
has
promised
to
trouble
me
no
farther
i
told
him
that
i
was
engaged
to
annesley
and
he
like
a
gentleman
has
assured
me
that
he
will
desist
just
because
you
asked
him
yes
aunt
just
because
i
asked
him
he
will
not
be
bound
by
such
a
promise
for
a
moment
it
is
a
thing
not
to
be
heard
of
if
that
kind
of
thing
is
to
go
on
any
young
lady
will
be
entitled
to
ask
any
young
gentleman
not
to
say
a
word
of
marriage
just
at
her
request
some
of
the
young
ladies
would
not
care
for
that
perhaps
do
be
impertinent
i
should
not
for
one
aunt
only
that
i
am
already
engaged
and
of
course
the
young
ladies
would
be
bound
to
make
such
requests
which
would
go
for
nothing
at
all
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
monstrous
you
are
not
only
to
have
the
liberty
of
refusing
but
are
to
be
allowed
to
bind
a
gentleman
not
to
ask
he
has
promised
pshaw
it
means
nothing
it
is
between
him
and
me
i
asked
him
because
i
wished
to
save
myself
from
being
troubled
as
for
that
other
man
my
dear
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
from
all
that
i
hear
it
is
on
the
cards
that
he
may
be
arrested
and
put
into
prison
i
am
quite
sure
that
at
any
rate
he
deserves
it
the
letters
which
sir
magnus
gets
about
him
are
fearful
the
things
that
he
has
done
well
penal
servitude
for
life
would
be
the
proper
punishment
and
it
will
come
upon
him
sooner
or
later
i
never
knew
a
man
of
that
kind
escape
and
you
now
to
come
and
tell
us
that
you
intend
to
be
his
wife
i
do
said
florence
bobbing
her
head
and
what
your
uncle
says
to
you
has
no
effect
not
the
least
in
the
world
nor
what
my
aunt
says
i
believe
that
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
know
what
they
are
talking
about
you
have
been
defaming
a
gentleman
of
the
highest
character
a
fellow
of
a
college
a
noble
man
simply
because
because
because
then
she
burst
into
tears
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
but
she
did
not
break
down
before
she
had
looked
at
her
aunt
and
spoken
to
her
aunt
with
a
fierce
indignation
which
had
altogether
served
to
silence
lady
mountjoy
for
the
moment
part
ii
chapter
xxxiii
barry
sir
you
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
me
i
am
sure
it
will
be
better
for
us
both
to
remain
as
we
are
this
was
said
by
miss
dorothy
grey
as
a
gentleman
departed
from
her
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
at
the
fulham
miss
grey
had
received
an
offer
of
marriage
and
had
declined
it
the
offer
had
been
made
by
a
worthy
man
he
being
no
other
than
her
father
partner
barry
it
may
be
remembered
that
on
discussing
the
affairs
of
the
firm
with
her
father
dolly
grey
had
been
accustomed
to
call
this
partner
the
devil
it
was
not
that
she
had
thought
this
partner
to
be
specially
devilish
nor
was
he
so
it
had
ever
been
miss
grey
object
to
have
the
affairs
of
the
firm
managed
with
an
integrity
which
among
lawyers
might
be
called
quixotic
her
father
she
had
dubbed
reason
and
herself
conscience
but
in
calling
barry
the
devil
she
had
not
intended
to
signify
any
defalcation
from
honesty
more
than
ordinary
in
offices
she
did
in
fact
like
barry
he
would
occasionally
come
out
and
dine
with
her
father
he
was
courteous
and
respectful
and
performed
his
duties
with
diligence
he
spent
nobody
money
but
his
own
and
not
all
of
that
nor
did
he
look
upon
the
world
as
a
place
to
which
men
were
sent
that
they
might
play
he
was
nearly
forty
years
old
was
clean
a
little
bald
and
healthy
in
all
his
ways
there
was
nothing
of
a
devil
about
him
except
that
his
conscience
was
not
peculiarly
attentive
to
abstract
honesty
and
abstract
virtue
there
must
according
to
him
be
always
a
little
give
and
take
in
the
world
but
in
the
pursuit
of
his
profession
he
gave
a
great
deal
more
than
he
took
he
thought
himself
to
be
an
honest
practitioner
and
yet
in
all
domestic
professional
conferences
with
her
father
barry
had
always
been
miss
grey
devil
the
possibility
of
such
a
request
as
had
been
now
made
had
been
already
discussed
between
dolly
and
her
father
dolly
had
said
that
the
idea
was
absurd
grey
had
not
seen
the
absurdity
there
had
been
nothing
more
common
he
had
said
than
that
a
young
partner
should
marry
an
old
partner
daughter
it
not
put
into
the
partnership
deed
dolly
had
rejoined
but
dolly
had
never
believed
that
the
time
would
come
now
it
had
come
barry
had
as
yet
possessed
no
more
than
a
fourth
of
the
business
he
had
come
in
without
any
capital
and
had
been
contented
with
a
fourth
he
now
suggested
to
dolly
that
on
their
marriage
the
business
should
be
equally
divided
and
he
had
named
the
house
in
which
they
would
live
there
was
a
pleasant
genteel
residence
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
at
putney
miss
grey
had
suggested
that
the
business
might
be
divided
in
a
manner
that
would
be
less
burdensome
to
barry
as
for
the
house
she
could
not
leave
her
father
upon
the
whole
she
had
thought
that
it
would
be
better
for
both
of
them
that
they
should
remain
as
they
were
by
that
miss
grey
had
not
intended
to
signify
that
barry
was
to
remain
single
but
that
he
would
have
to
do
so
in
reference
to
miss
grey
when
he
was
gone
dolly
grey
spent
the
remainder
of
the
afternoon
in
contemplating
what
would
have
been
her
condition
had
she
agreed
to
join
her
lot
to
that
of
barry
and
she
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
have
been
simply
unendurable
there
was
nothing
of
romance
in
her
nature
but
as
she
looked
at
matrimony
with
all
its
blisses
and
barry
among
them
she
told
herself
that
death
would
be
preferable
i
know
myself
she
said
i
should
come
to
hate
him
with
a
miserable
hatred
and
then
i
should
hate
myself
for
having
done
him
so
great
an
evil
and
as
she
continued
thinking
she
assured
herself
that
there
was
but
one
man
with
whom
she
could
live
and
that
that
was
her
father
and
then
other
questions
presented
themselves
to
her
which
were
not
so
easily
answered
what
would
become
of
her
when
he
should
go
he
was
now
and
she
was
only
he
was
healthy
for
his
age
but
would
complain
of
his
work
she
knew
that
he
must
in
course
of
nature
go
much
the
first
ten
years
he
might
live
while
she
might
probably
be
called
upon
to
endure
for
thirty
more
i
shall
have
to
do
it
all
alone
she
said
all
alone
without
a
companion
without
one
soul
to
whom
i
can
open
my
own
but
if
i
were
to
marry
barry
she
continued
i
should
at
once
be
encumbered
with
a
soul
to
whom
i
could
not
open
my
own
i
suppose
i
shall
be
enabled
to
live
through
it
as
do
others
then
she
began
to
prepare
for
her
father
coming
as
long
as
he
did
remain
with
her
she
would
make
the
most
of
him
papa
she
said
as
she
took
him
by
the
hand
as
he
entered
the
house
and
led
him
into
the
who
do
you
think
has
been
here
mr
barry
then
he
has
told
you
not
a
word
not
even
that
he
was
coming
but
i
saw
him
as
he
left
the
chambers
and
he
had
on
a
bright
hat
and
a
new
coat
and
he
thought
that
those
could
move
me
i
have
not
known
that
he
has
wanted
to
move
you
you
asked
me
to
guess
and
i
have
guessed
right
it
seems
yes
you
have
guessed
right
and
why
did
he
come
only
to
ask
me
to
be
his
wife
and
what
did
you
say
to
him
dolly
what
did
i
say
to
the
devil
she
still
held
him
by
the
hand
and
now
she
laughed
lightly
as
she
looked
into
his
face
can
not
you
guess
what
i
said
to
him
i
am
sorry
for
it
that
all
sorry
for
it
oh
papa
do
not
say
that
you
are
sorry
do
you
want
to
lose
me
i
do
not
want
to
think
that
for
my
own
selfish
purposes
i
have
retained
you
so
he
has
asked
you
yes
he
has
asked
me
and
you
have
answered
him
positively
most
positively
and
for
my
sake
no
papa
i
have
not
said
that
i
was
joking
when
i
asked
whether
you
wished
to
lose
me
of
course
you
do
not
want
to
lose
me
then
she
wound
her
arm
round
him
and
put
up
her
face
to
be
kissed
but
now
come
and
dress
yourself
as
you
call
it
the
dinner
is
late
we
will
talk
about
it
again
after
dinner
but
immediately
after
dinner
the
conversation
went
away
to
scarborough
and
the
scarborough
matters
i
am
to
see
augustus
and
he
is
to
tell
me
something
about
mountjoy
and
his
affairs
they
say
that
mountjoy
is
now
in
paris
the
money
can
be
given
to
them
now
if
he
will
consent
and
will
sign
the
deed
releasing
the
property
but
the
men
have
not
all
as
yet
agreed
to
accept
the
simple
sums
which
they
advanced
that
fellow
hart
stands
out
and
says
that
he
would
sooner
lose
it
all
then
he
will
lose
it
all
said
dolly
but
the
squire
will
consent
to
pay
nothing
unless
they
all
agree
augustus
is
talking
about
his
excessive
generosity
it
is
generous
on
his
part
said
dolly
he
sees
his
own
advantage
though
i
can
not
quite
understand
where
he
tells
tyrrwhit
that
as
there
is
so
great
an
increase
to
the
property
he
is
willing
for
the
sake
of
the
good
name
of
the
family
to
pay
all
that
has
been
in
truth
advanced
but
he
is
most
anxious
to
do
it
now
while
his
father
is
alive
i
think
he
fears
that
there
will
be
lawsuits
and
that
they
may
succeed
i
doubt
whether
he
thanks
his
father
but
why
should
his
father
lie
for
his
sake
since
they
are
on
such
bad
terms
because
his
father
was
on
worse
terms
with
mountjoy
when
he
told
the
lie
that
is
what
i
think
augustus
thinks
but
his
father
told
no
lie
at
that
time
and
can
not
now
go
back
to
falsehood
my
belief
is
that
if
he
were
confident
that
such
is
the
fact
he
would
not
surrender
a
shilling
to
pay
these
men
their
moneys
he
may
stop
a
lawsuit
which
is
like
enough
though
they
could
only
lose
it
and
if
mountjoy
should
turn
out
to
be
the
heir
which
is
impossible
he
will
be
able
to
turn
round
and
say
that
by
his
efforts
he
had
saved
so
much
of
the
property
my
head
becomes
so
bewildered
said
dolly
that
i
can
hardly
understand
it
yet
i
think
i
understand
it
but
i
can
only
guess
at
his
mind
but
he
has
got
tyrrwhit
to
accept
forty
thousand
pounds
which
is
the
sum
he
in
truth
advanced
the
stake
is
too
great
for
the
man
to
lose
it
without
ruin
he
can
get
it
back
now
and
save
himself
but
hart
is
the
more
determined
blackguard
he
with
two
others
has
a
claim
for
thousand
pounds
for
which
he
has
given
but
ten
thousand
pounds
in
hard
cash
and
he
thinks
that
he
may
get
some
profit
out
of
tyrrwhit
money
and
holds
out
for
how
much
for
the
entire
debt
he
tells
me
but
i
know
that
he
is
trying
to
deal
with
tyrrwhit
tyrrwhit
would
pay
him
five
thousand
i
think
so
as
to
secure
the
immediate
payment
of
his
own
money
then
there
are
a
host
of
others
who
are
contented
to
take
what
they
have
advanced
but
not
contented
if
hart
is
to
have
more
there
are
other
men
in
the
background
who
advanced
the
money
all
the
rascaldom
of
london
is
let
loose
upon
me
but
hart
is
the
one
man
who
holds
his
head
the
highest
but
if
they
will
accept
no
terms
they
will
get
nothing
said
dolly
if
once
they
attempt
to
go
to
law
all
will
be
lost
there
are
wheels
within
wheels
when
the
old
man
dies
mountjoy
himself
will
probably
put
in
a
claim
to
the
entire
estate
and
will
get
some
lawyer
to
take
up
the
case
for
him
you
would
not
certainly
not
because
i
know
that
augustus
is
the
eldest
legitimate
son
as
far
as
i
can
make
it
out
augustus
is
at
present
allowing
mountjoy
the
money
on
which
he
lives
his
father
does
not
but
the
old
man
must
know
that
augustus
does
though
he
pretends
to
be
ignorant
but
why
is
hart
to
get
money
out
of
tyrrwhit
to
secure
the
payment
of
the
remainder
tyrrwhit
would
be
very
glad
to
get
his
forty
thousand
pounds
back
would
pay
five
thousand
pounds
to
get
the
forty
back
but
nothing
will
be
paid
unless
they
all
agree
to
join
in
freeing
the
property
therefore
hart
who
is
the
sharpest
rascal
of
the
lot
stands
out
for
some
share
of
his
contemplated
plunder
and
you
must
be
joined
in
such
an
arrangement
not
at
all
i
can
not
help
surmising
what
is
to
be
done
in
dealing
with
the
funds
of
the
property
i
go
to
the
men
and
say
to
them
so
much
and
so
much
and
so
much
you
have
actually
lost
agree
among
yourselves
to
accept
that
and
it
shall
be
paid
to
you
that
is
honest
i
do
not
know
but
i
do
every
shilling
that
the
son
of
my
client
has
had
from
them
my
client
is
ready
to
pay
there
is
some
hitch
among
them
and
i
make
my
surmises
but
i
have
no
dealings
with
them
it
is
for
them
to
come
to
me
now
dolly
only
shook
her
head
you
can
not
touch
pitch
and
not
be
defiled
that
was
what
dolly
said
but
said
it
to
herself
and
then
she
went
on
and
declared
to
herself
still
farther
that
barry
was
pitch
she
knew
that
barry
had
seen
hart
and
had
seen
tyrrwhit
and
had
been
bargaining
with
them
she
excused
her
father
because
he
was
her
father
but
according
to
her
thinking
there
should
have
been
no
dealings
with
such
men
as
these
except
at
the
end
of
a
pair
of
tongs
and
now
dolly
said
her
father
after
a
long
pause
tell
me
about
mr
barry
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
told
not
of
what
you
said
to
him
but
of
the
reasons
which
have
made
you
so
determined
would
it
not
be
better
for
you
to
be
married
if
i
could
choose
my
husband
whom
would
you
choose
you
that
is
nonsense
i
am
your
father
you
know
what
i
mean
there
is
no
one
else
among
my
circle
of
acquaintances
with
whom
i
should
care
to
live
there
is
no
one
else
with
whom
i
should
care
to
do
more
than
die
when
i
look
at
it
all
round
it
seems
to
be
absolutely
impossible
that
i
should
on
a
sudden
entertain
habits
of
the
closest
intimacy
with
such
a
one
as
barry
what
should
i
say
to
him
when
he
went
forth
in
the
morning
how
should
i
welcome
him
when
he
came
back
at
night
what
would
be
our
breakfast
and
what
would
be
our
dinner
think
what
are
yours
and
mine
all
the
little
solicitudes
all
the
free
abuse
all
the
certainty
of
an
affection
which
has
grown
through
so
many
years
all
the
absolute
assurance
on
the
part
of
each
that
the
one
does
really
know
the
inner
soul
of
the
other
it
would
come
with
barry
that
is
your
idea
of
my
soul
with
which
you
have
been
in
communion
for
so
many
years
in
the
first
place
you
think
that
i
am
a
person
likely
to
be
able
to
transfer
myself
suddenly
to
the
first
man
that
comes
my
way
gradually
you
might
do
so
at
any
rate
so
as
to
make
life
possible
you
will
be
all
alone
think
what
it
will
be
to
have
to
live
all
alone
i
have
thought
i
do
know
that
it
would
be
well
that
you
should
be
able
to
take
me
with
you
but
i
can
not
no
there
is
the
hardship
you
must
leave
me
and
i
must
be
alone
that
is
what
we
have
to
expect
but
for
her
sake
and
for
mine
we
may
be
left
while
we
can
be
left
what
would
you
be
without
me
think
of
that
i
should
bear
it
you
could
you
break
your
heart
and
die
and
if
you
can
imagine
my
living
there
and
pouring
out
barry
tea
for
him
you
must
imagine
also
what
i
should
have
to
say
to
myself
about
you
will
die
of
course
but
then
he
has
come
to
that
sort
of
age
at
which
it
much
signify
then
i
should
go
on
with
barry
tea
he
come
to
kiss
me
when
he
went
away
and
i
should
plunge
a
knife
into
him
dolly
or
into
myself
which
would
be
more
likely
fancy
that
man
calling
me
dolly
then
she
got
up
and
stood
behind
his
chair
and
put
her
arm
round
his
neck
would
you
like
to
kiss
him
or
any
man
for
the
matter
of
that
there
is
no
one
else
to
whom
my
fancy
strays
but
i
think
that
i
should
murder
them
all
or
commit
suicide
in
the
first
place
i
should
want
my
husband
to
be
a
gentleman
there
are
not
a
great
many
gentlemen
about
you
are
fastidious
come
now
be
honest
is
our
barry
a
gentleman
then
there
was
a
pause
during
which
she
waited
for
a
reply
i
will
have
an
answer
i
have
a
right
to
demand
an
answer
to
that
question
since
you
have
proposed
the
man
to
me
as
a
husband
nay
i
have
not
proposed
him
you
have
expressed
a
regret
that
i
have
not
accepted
him
is
he
a
gentleman
well
yes
i
think
he
is
mind
we
are
sworn
and
you
are
bound
to
speak
the
truth
what
right
has
he
to
be
a
gentleman
who
was
his
father
and
who
was
his
mother
of
what
kind
were
his
nursery
belongings
he
has
become
an
attorney
and
so
have
you
but
has
there
been
any
one
to
whisper
to
him
among
his
teachings
that
in
that
profession
as
in
all
others
there
should
be
a
sense
of
high
honor
to
guide
him
he
must
not
cheat
or
do
anything
to
cause
him
to
be
struck
off
the
rolls
but
is
it
not
with
him
what
his
client
wants
and
not
what
honor
demands
and
in
the
daily
intercourse
of
life
would
he
satisfy
what
you
call
my
fastidiousness
nothing
on
earth
will
ever
do
that
you
do
i
agree
with
you
that
nothing
else
on
earth
ever
will
the
man
who
might
wo
come
not
that
i
can
imagine
such
a
man
because
i
know
that
i
am
spoiled
of
course
there
are
gentlemen
though
not
a
great
many
but
he
must
be
ugly
and
he
must
be
he
seem
to
be
old
and
certainly
he
must
seem
to
be
young
i
should
not
like
a
man
to
wear
old
clothes
but
he
must
wear
new
he
must
be
well
read
but
never
show
it
he
must
work
hard
but
he
must
come
home
to
dinner
at
the
proper
time
here
she
laughed
and
gently
shook
her
head
he
must
never
talk
about
his
business
at
night
though
dear
darling
old
father
he
shall
do
that
if
he
will
talk
like
you
and
then
which
is
the
hardest
thing
of
all
i
must
have
known
him
intimately
for
at
any
rate
ten
years
as
for
barry
i
never
should
know
him
intimately
though
i
were
married
to
him
for
ten
years
and
it
has
all
been
my
doing
just
so
you
have
made
the
bed
and
you
must
lie
on
it
it
has
been
a
bad
bed
not
for
me
heaven
knows
it
has
not
been
bad
for
me
nor
for
me
as
things
go
only
that
there
will
come
an
arousing
before
we
shall
be
ready
to
get
up
together
your
time
will
probably
be
the
first
i
can
better
afford
to
lose
you
than
you
to
lose
me
god
send
that
it
shall
be
so
it
is
nature
she
said
it
is
to
be
expected
and
will
on
that
account
be
the
less
grievous
because
it
has
been
expected
i
shall
have
to
devote
myself
to
those
carroll
children
i
sometimes
think
that
the
work
of
the
world
should
not
be
made
pleasant
to
us
what
profit
will
it
be
to
me
to
have
done
my
duty
by
you
i
think
there
will
be
some
profit
if
i
am
good
to
my
cousins
at
any
rate
you
wo
have
mr
barry
said
the
father
not
if
i
know
it
said
the
daughter
and
you
i
think
are
a
wicked
old
man
to
suggest
it
then
she
bade
him
and
went
to
bed
for
they
had
been
talking
now
till
near
twelve
but
barry
when
he
had
gone
home
told
himself
that
he
had
progressed
in
his
quite
as
far
as
he
had
expected
on
the
first
opportunity
he
went
over
the
bridge
and
looked
at
the
genteel
house
and
resolved
as
to
certain
little
changes
which
should
be
made
thus
one
room
should
look
here
and
the
nursery
should
look
there
the
walk
to
the
railway
would
only
take
five
minutes
and
there
would
be
five
minutes
again
from
the
temple
station
in
london
he
thought
it
would
do
very
well
for
domestic
felicity
and
as
for
a
fortune
half
the
business
would
not
be
bad
and
then
the
whole
business
would
follow
and
he
in
his
turn
would
be
enabled
to
let
some
young
fellow
in
who
should
do
the
greater
part
of
the
work
and
take
the
smaller
part
of
the
pay
as
had
been
the
case
with
himself
but
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
that
the
young
lady
had
meant
what
she
said
when
she
refused
him
it
was
the
ordinary
way
with
young
ladies
of
course
he
had
expected
no
enthusiasm
of
love
nor
had
he
wanted
it
he
would
wait
for
three
weeks
and
then
he
would
go
to
fulham
again
chapter
xxxiv
juniper
though
there
was
an
air
of
badinage
almost
of
tomfoolery
about
dolly
when
she
spoke
of
her
matrimonial
prospects
to
her
father
as
when
she
said
that
she
would
stick
a
knife
into
barry
still
there
was
a
seriousness
in
all
she
said
which
was
more
than
grave
she
was
pathetic
and
melancholy
she
knew
that
there
was
nothing
before
her
but
to
stay
with
her
father
and
then
to
devote
herself
to
her
cousins
from
whom
she
was
aware
that
she
recoiled
almost
with
hatred
and
she
knew
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
be
married
if
only
the
right
man
would
come
the
right
man
would
have
to
bear
with
her
father
and
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
to
the
end
the
right
man
must
be
a
chevalier
sans
peur
et
sans
the
right
man
must
be
and
masterful
and
must
have
a
will
of
his
own
but
he
must
be
always
for
good
and
where
was
she
to
find
such
a
man
as
this
she
who
was
only
an
attorney
daughter
plain
too
and
with
many
eccentricities
she
was
not
intended
to
marry
and
consequently
the
only
man
who
came
in
her
way
was
her
father
partner
for
whom
in
regard
to
a
share
in
the
business
she
might
be
desirable
devotion
to
the
carroll
cousins
was
manifestly
her
duty
the
two
eldest
girls
she
absolutely
did
hate
and
their
father
to
hate
the
father
because
he
was
vicious
beyond
cure
might
be
very
well
but
she
could
not
hate
the
girls
without
being
aware
that
she
was
guilty
of
a
grievous
sin
every
taste
possessed
by
them
was
antagonistic
to
her
their
amusements
their
literature
their
clothes
their
manners
especially
in
regard
to
men
their
gestures
and
color
were
distasteful
to
her
they
hide
their
dirt
with
a
thin
veneer
of
cheap
finery
said
dolly
to
her
father
he
had
replied
by
telling
her
that
she
was
nasty
no
but
unfortunately
i
can
not
but
see
nastiness
dolly
herself
was
clean
to
fastidiousness
take
off
her
coarse
frock
and
there
the
lady
began
look
at
the
heels
of
sophie
boots
give
her
a
push
and
she
fall
off
her
pins
as
though
they
were
stilts
they
always
asking
to
have
a
shoemaker
bill
paid
and
yet
they
wo
wear
stout
boots
i
pay
the
man
she
said
to
amelia
one
day
if
promise
to
wear
what
i
buy
you
for
the
next
six
months
but
amelia
had
only
turned
up
her
nose
these
were
the
relatives
to
whom
it
would
become
her
duty
to
devote
her
life
the
next
morning
she
started
off
to
call
in
bolsover
terrace
with
an
intention
not
to
begin
her
duty
but
to
make
a
struggle
at
the
adequate
performance
of
it
she
took
with
her
some
article
of
clothing
intended
for
one
of
the
younger
children
but
which
the
child
herself
was
to
complete
but
when
she
entered
the
parlor
she
was
astounded
at
finding
that
carroll
was
there
it
was
nearly
twelve
and
at
that
time
carroll
never
was
there
he
was
either
in
bed
or
at
tattersall
or
dolly
did
not
care
where
she
had
long
since
made
up
her
mind
that
there
must
be
a
permanent
quarrel
between
herself
and
her
uncle
and
her
desire
was
generally
respected
now
unfortunately
he
was
present
and
with
him
were
his
wife
and
two
elder
daughters
to
be
devoted
thought
dolly
to
herself
to
such
a
family
as
this
and
without
anybody
else
in
the
world
to
care
for
she
gave
her
aunt
a
kiss
and
touched
the
girls
hands
and
made
a
very
distant
bow
to
carroll
then
she
began
about
the
parcel
in
her
hands
and
having
given
her
instructions
was
preparing
to
depart
but
her
aunt
stopped
her
i
think
you
ought
to
know
dorothea
certainly
said
carroll
it
is
quite
right
that
your
cousin
should
know
if
you
think
it
proper
i
sure
i
ca
object
said
amelia
she
wo
approve
i
sure
said
sophie
her
young
man
has
come
forward
and
spoken
said
carroll
and
quite
in
a
proper
spirit
said
amelia
of
course
said
carroll
we
are
not
to
expect
too
much
though
we
are
respectable
in
birth
and
all
that
we
are
poor
carroll
has
got
nothing
to
give
her
i
been
the
most
unfortunate
man
in
the
world
said
carroll
we
wo
talk
about
that
now
continued
carroll
here
we
are
without
anything
you
have
decent
blood
said
dolly
at
any
rate
on
one
side
for
she
did
not
believe
in
the
carrolls
on
both
on
both
said
carroll
rising
up
and
putting
his
hand
upon
his
heart
i
can
boast
of
royal
blood
among
my
ancestors
but
here
we
are
without
anything
said
carroll
again
juniper
is
a
most
respectable
man
he
has
been
attached
to
some
of
the
leading
racing
establishments
in
the
kingdom
said
carroll
dolly
had
heard
of
juniper
as
a
trainer
though
she
did
not
accurately
know
what
a
trainer
meant
he
is
almost
as
great
a
man
as
the
owner
for
the
matter
of
that
said
amelia
standing
up
for
her
lover
he
is
not
to
say
young
perhaps
forty
said
carroll
and
he
has
a
very
decent
house
of
his
own
at
newmarket
dolly
immediately
began
to
think
whether
this
might
be
for
the
better
or
for
the
worse
newmarket
was
a
long
way
off
and
the
girl
would
be
taken
away
and
it
might
be
a
good
thing
to
dispose
of
one
of
such
a
string
of
daughters
even
to
juniper
of
course
there
would
be
the
disagreeable
nature
of
the
connection
but
as
dolly
had
once
said
to
her
father
their
share
of
the
world
burdens
had
to
be
borne
and
this
was
one
of
them
her
first
cousin
must
marry
the
trainer
she
who
had
spoken
so
enthusiastically
about
gentlemen
must
put
up
with
it
she
knew
that
juniper
was
but
a
small
man
in
his
own
line
but
she
would
never
disown
him
by
word
of
mouth
he
should
be
her
cousin
juniper
but
she
did
hope
that
she
might
not
be
called
upon
to
see
him
frequently
after
all
he
might
be
much
more
respectable
than
carroll
i
am
glad
he
has
a
house
of
his
own
said
dolly
it
is
a
much
better
house
than
fulham
manor
said
amelia
dolly
was
angered
not
at
the
comparison
between
the
houses
but
at
the
ingratitude
and
insolence
of
the
girl
very
well
said
she
addressing
herself
to
her
aunt
if
her
parents
are
contented
of
course
it
is
not
for
me
or
for
papa
to
be
discontented
the
thing
to
think
of
is
the
honesty
of
the
man
and
his
industry
not
the
excellence
of
the
house
but
you
seemed
to
think
that
we
were
to
live
in
a
pigsty
said
amelia
juniper
stands
very
high
on
the
turf
said
carroll
leadabit
horses
have
always
run
straight
and
mousetrap
won
the
trial
stakes
last
spring
giving
two
pounds
to
a
tall
fellow
you
remember
seeing
him
here
once
last
summer
this
was
addressed
to
miss
grey
but
miss
grey
had
made
up
her
mind
never
to
exchange
a
word
with
carroll
when
is
it
to
be
my
dear
said
miss
grey
turning
to
the
ladies
but
intending
to
address
herself
to
amelia
she
had
already
made
up
her
mind
to
forgive
the
girl
for
her
insolence
about
the
house
if
the
girl
was
to
be
taken
away
there
was
so
much
the
more
reason
for
forgiving
her
that
and
other
things
oh
i
thought
that
you
did
not
mean
to
speak
to
me
at
all
said
amelia
i
supposed
the
cut
was
to
be
extended
from
papa
to
me
amelia
how
can
you
be
so
silly
said
the
mother
if
you
think
i
going
to
put
up
with
that
kind
of
thing
mistaken
said
amelia
she
had
got
not
only
a
lover
but
a
husband
in
prospect
and
was
much
superior
to
her
cousin
who
had
neither
one
or
the
other
as
far
as
she
was
aware
juniper
with
an
excellent
house
and
a
plentiful
income
is
quite
good
enough
for
me
though
he
has
got
any
regal
ancestors
she
did
not
intend
to
laugh
at
her
father
but
was
aware
that
something
had
been
said
about
ancestors
by
her
cousin
a
gentleman
who
has
the
management
of
horses
is
almost
the
same
as
owning
them
but
when
is
it
to
be
again
asked
dolly
that
depends
a
little
upon
my
brother
said
carroll
in
a
voice
hardly
above
a
whisper
juniper
has
spoken
about
a
day
then
it
will
depend
chiefly
on
himself
and
the
young
lady
i
suppose
well
dorothea
there
are
money
difficulties
there
no
denying
it
i
wish
i
could
shower
gold
into
her
lap
said
carroll
only
for
the
accursed
conventionalities
of
the
world
bother
papa
said
sophia
it
will
be
the
last
of
it
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
said
amelia
juniper
has
said
something
about
a
few
hundred
pounds
said
carroll
it
is
much
that
he
wants
then
miss
grey
spoke
in
a
severe
tone
you
must
speak
to
my
father
about
that
i
am
not
to
have
your
good
word
i
suppose
said
amelia
human
flesh
and
blood
could
not
but
remember
all
that
had
been
done
and
always
with
her
consent
five
hundred
pounds
is
not
a
great
deal
for
portioning
off
a
girl
when
that
is
to
be
the
last
that
she
is
ever
to
have
one
of
six
nieces
whose
father
and
mother
were
maintained
and
that
without
the
slightest
claim
it
was
so
that
dorothy
argued
but
her
arguments
were
kept
to
her
own
bosom
but
i
must
trust
to
my
dear
uncle
i
see
that
i
am
not
to
have
a
word
from
you
the
matter
was
now
becoming
serious
here
was
the
eldest
girl
one
of
six
daughters
putting
in
her
claim
for
five
hundred
pounds
portion
this
would
amount
to
three
thousand
pounds
for
the
lot
and
as
the
process
of
marrying
them
went
on
they
would
all
have
to
be
maintained
as
at
present
what
with
their
school
expenses
and
their
clothes
the
necessary
funds
for
the
carroll
family
amounted
to
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
that
was
the
regular
allowance
and
there
were
others
whenever
carroll
wanted
a
pair
of
trousers
and
dolly
acerbation
was
aroused
by
a
belief
on
her
part
that
the
money
asked
for
trousers
took
him
generally
to
and
now
five
hundred
pounds
was
boldly
demanded
so
as
to
induce
a
groom
to
make
one
of
the
girls
his
wife
she
almost
regretted
that
in
former
years
she
had
promised
to
assist
her
father
in
befriending
the
carroll
relations
perhaps
dorothea
you
wo
mind
stepping
into
my
bedroom
with
me
just
for
a
moment
this
was
said
by
carroll
and
dolly
most
unwillingly
followed
her
aunt
of
course
i
know
all
that
you
got
to
say
began
carroll
then
aunt
why
bring
me
in
here
because
i
wish
to
explain
things
a
little
do
be
dorothea
i
wo
if
i
can
help
it
i
know
your
nature
how
good
it
is
here
dorothy
shook
her
head
only
think
of
me
and
of
my
sufferings
i
have
come
to
this
without
suffering
then
the
poor
woman
began
to
cry
i
feel
for
you
through
it
all
i
do
said
dolly
that
poor
man
to
have
to
be
always
with
him
and
always
doing
my
best
to
keep
him
out
of
mischief
a
man
who
will
do
nothing
else
must
do
harm
of
course
he
must
but
what
can
he
do
now
and
the
children
i
can
see
of
course
i
know
that
they
are
not
all
that
they
ought
to
be
but
with
six
of
them
and
nobody
but
myself
how
can
i
do
it
all
and
they
are
his
children
as
well
as
mine
dolly
heart
was
filled
with
pity
as
she
heard
this
which
she
knew
to
be
so
true
in
answering
you
they
have
uppish
bad
ways
they
do
like
to
submit
to
one
so
near
their
own
age
not
a
word
that
has
come
from
the
mouth
of
one
of
them
addressed
to
myself
has
ever
done
them
any
harm
with
my
father
that
is
what
you
mean
no
but
with
yourself
i
do
not
take
anger
against
them
out
of
the
room
with
me
now
about
mr
juniper
the
question
is
one
much
too
big
for
me
am
i
to
tell
my
father
i
was
thinking
that
if
you
would
do
so
i
can
not
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
find
five
hundred
pounds
for
mr
juniper
perhaps
four
would
do
nor
can
i
ask
him
to
drive
a
bargain
how
much
would
he
give
her
to
be
married
why
should
he
give
her
anything
he
feeds
her
and
gives
her
clothes
it
is
only
fit
that
the
truth
should
be
explained
to
you
girls
so
circumstanced
when
they
are
clothed
and
fed
by
their
own
fathers
must
be
married
without
fortunes
or
must
remain
unmarried
as
sophie
and
georgina
and
minna
and
brenda
come
up
the
same
requests
will
be
made
poor
potsey
said
the
mother
for
potsey
was
a
plain
girl
if
this
be
done
for
amelia
must
it
not
be
done
for
all
of
them
papa
is
not
a
rich
man
but
he
has
been
very
generous
is
it
fair
to
ask
him
for
five
hundred
pounds
to
give
to
mr
juniper
a
gentleman
nowadays
does
not
like
not
to
get
something
then
a
gentleman
must
go
where
something
is
to
be
got
the
truth
has
to
be
told
aunt
carroll
my
father
is
willing
enough
to
do
what
he
can
for
you
and
the
girls
but
i
do
not
think
that
he
will
give
five
hundred
pounds
to
mr
juniper
it
is
once
for
all
four
hundred
pounds
perhaps
would
do
i
do
not
think
that
he
can
make
a
bargain
nor
that
he
will
pay
any
sum
to
mr
juniper
to
get
one
of
them
off
would
be
so
much
what
is
to
become
of
them
to
have
one
married
would
be
the
way
for
others
oh
dorothy
if
you
would
only
think
of
my
condition
i
know
your
papa
will
do
what
you
tell
him
dolly
felt
that
her
father
would
be
more
likely
to
do
it
if
she
were
not
to
interfere
at
all
but
she
could
not
say
that
she
did
feel
the
request
to
be
altogether
unreasonable
she
struggled
to
avert
from
her
own
mind
all
feeling
of
dislike
for
the
girl
and
to
look
at
it
as
she
might
have
done
if
amelia
had
been
her
special
friend
aunt
carroll
she
said
you
had
better
go
up
to
london
and
see
my
father
there
in
his
chambers
you
will
catch
him
if
you
go
at
once
alone
yes
alone
tell
him
about
the
girl
marriage
and
let
him
judge
what
he
ought
to
do
could
not
you
come
with
me
no
you
do
understand
i
have
to
think
of
his
money
he
can
say
what
he
will
do
with
his
own
he
will
never
give
it
without
coming
to
you
he
never
will
if
he
does
come
to
me
you
may
prevail
with
him
a
man
may
throw
away
his
own
money
as
he
pleases
i
can
not
tell
him
that
he
ought
to
do
it
you
may
say
that
you
have
told
me
and
that
i
have
sent
you
to
him
and
tell
him
let
him
do
what
he
will
that
i
shall
find
no
fault
with
him
if
you
can
understand
me
and
him
you
will
know
that
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
beyond
that
then
dolly
took
her
leave
and
went
home
the
mother
turning
it
all
over
in
her
mind
did
understand
something
of
her
niece
and
went
off
to
london
as
quick
as
the
omnibus
could
take
her
there
she
did
see
her
brother
and
he
came
back
in
consequence
to
dinner
a
little
earlier
than
usual
why
did
you
send
my
sister
to
me
were
the
first
words
which
he
said
to
dolly
because
it
was
your
business
and
not
mine
how
dare
you
separate
my
business
and
yours
what
do
you
think
i
have
done
given
the
young
lady
five
hundred
pounds
down
on
the
nail
worse
than
that
worse
much
worse
but
why
did
you
send
my
sister
to
my
chambers
but
what
have
you
done
papa
you
do
mean
that
you
have
given
the
shark
more
than
he
demands
i
do
know
that
he
a
shark
why
should
the
man
want
five
hundred
pounds
with
his
wife
barry
would
want
much
more
with
you
and
would
be
entitled
to
ask
for
much
more
you
are
my
father
yes
but
those
poor
girls
have
been
taught
to
look
upon
me
almost
as
their
father
but
what
have
you
done
i
have
promised
them
each
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
on
their
wedding
day
three
hundred
pounds
to
go
to
their
husbands
and
fifty
pounds
for
wedding
expenses
on
condition
that
they
marry
with
my
approval
i
shall
not
be
so
hard
to
please
for
them
as
for
you
and
you
have
approved
of
mr
juniper
i
have
already
set
on
foot
inquiries
down
at
newmarket
and
i
have
made
an
exception
in
favor
of
juniper
he
is
to
have
four
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
jane
only
asked
four
hundred
pounds
to
begin
with
you
are
not
to
find
fault
with
me
no
that
is
part
of
the
bargain
i
wonder
whether
my
aunt
knew
what
a
thoroughly
thing
i
did
we
must
have
no
more
puddings
now
and
you
must
come
down
by
the
omnibus
it
is
not
quite
so
bad
as
that
dolly
when
one
has
given
away
one
money
extravagantly
one
ought
to
be
made
to
feel
the
pinch
one
self
but
dear
dear
darling
old
man
why
should
you
give
away
your
money
as
you
please
i
do
want
it
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
but
what
there
will
be
plenty
for
me
but
when
the
girl
talks
about
her
five
hundred
pounds
so
glibly
as
though
she
had
a
right
to
expect
it
and
spoke
of
this
jockey
with
such
inward
pride
of
heart
a
girl
ought
to
be
proud
of
her
husband
your
niece
ought
not
to
be
proud
of
marrying
a
groom
but
she
angered
me
and
so
did
my
aunt
though
i
pitied
her
then
i
reflected
that
they
could
get
nothing
from
me
in
my
anger
not
even
a
promise
of
a
good
word
so
i
sent
her
to
you
it
was
at
any
rate
the
best
thing
i
could
do
for
them
grey
thought
that
it
was
chapter
xxxv
barry
and
juniper
the
joy
in
bolsover
terrace
was
intense
when
carroll
returned
home
we
are
all
to
have
three
hundred
and
fifty
pound
fortunes
when
we
get
husbands
said
georgina
anticipating
at
once
the
pleasures
of
matrimony
i
am
to
have
four
hundred
and
fifty
said
amelia
i
do
think
he
might
have
made
it
five
hundred
pounds
if
i
had
it
to
give
away
i
never
would
show
the
cloven
foot
about
the
last
fifty
pounds
but
he
only
to
have
four
hundred
pounds
said
sophia
your
things
are
to
be
bought
with
the
other
fifty
pounds
i
never
can
do
it
for
fifty
pounds
said
amelia
i
did
not
expect
that
i
was
to
find
my
own
trousseau
out
of
my
own
fortune
girls
how
can
you
be
so
ungrateful
said
their
mother
i
not
ungrateful
mamma
said
potsey
i
shall
be
very
much
obliged
when
i
get
my
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
how
long
will
it
be
you
got
to
find
the
young
man
first
potsey
i
do
think
ever
do
that
said
georgina
who
was
rather
proud
of
her
own
good
looks
this
took
place
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
carroll
had
gone
to
london
where
carroll
was
about
attending
to
some
of
those
duties
of
conviviality
in
the
performance
of
which
he
was
so
indefatigable
on
the
following
morning
at
twelve
he
was
still
in
bed
it
was
a
fact
in
the
family
that
on
such
an
occasion
he
would
lie
in
bed
and
that
before
twelve
he
would
have
managed
to
extract
from
his
wife
little
hoardings
at
any
rate
two
bottles
of
and
two
glasses
of
some
alcoholic
mixture
which
was
generally
called
brandy
i
have
a
sophie
he
had
said
on
this
occasion
with
reference
to
the
second
dose
and
do
make
haste
i
wish
you
go
yourself
because
that
girl
always
drinks
some
of
the
sperrits
what
go
to
the
it
a
most
respectable
publican
just
round
the
corner
indeed
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
kind
you
no
feeling
about
your
daughters
at
all
but
sophie
went
on
her
errand
and
in
order
to
protect
her
father
small
modicum
of
sperrits
she
slipped
on
her
cloak
and
walked
out
so
as
to
be
able
to
watch
the
girl
still
i
think
that
the
maiden
managed
to
get
a
sip
as
she
left
the
bar
the
father
in
the
with
his
head
between
his
hands
was
ruminating
on
the
way
which
girls
have
who
ca
do
a
turn
for
their
father
but
with
the
and
with
sophie
juniper
made
his
appearance
he
was
a
tall
man
but
he
looked
the
stable
and
he
smelled
of
it
his
clothes
no
doubt
were
decent
but
they
were
made
by
some
tailor
who
must
surely
work
for
horsey
men
and
no
others
there
is
a
class
of
men
who
always
choose
to
show
by
their
outward
appearance
that
they
belong
to
horses
and
they
succeed
juniper
was
one
of
them
though
he
was
anything
but
young
verging
by
appearance
on
fifty
years
so
he
has
been
at
it
again
miss
sophie
said
juniper
sophie
who
did
not
like
being
detected
in
the
performance
of
her
filial
duties
led
the
way
in
silence
into
the
house
and
disappeared
with
the
juniper
turned
into
the
parlor
where
was
carroll
with
the
other
girls
she
was
still
angry
as
angry
as
she
could
be
with
her
husband
who
on
being
informed
that
morning
of
what
his
wife
had
done
had
called
her
brother
a
beastly
stingy
old
beau
because
he
had
cut
amelia
off
with
four
hundred
and
fifty
instead
of
five
hundred
pounds
carroll
probably
knew
that
juniper
would
not
take
his
daughter
without
the
entirety
of
the
sum
stipulated
and
would
allow
no
portion
of
it
to
be
expended
on
oh
dick
is
this
you
said
amelia
i
suppose
you
come
for
your
news
juniper
was
richard
on
this
occasion
he
showed
no
affectionate
desire
to
embrace
his
betrothed
yes
it
me
he
said
and
then
gave
his
hand
all
round
first
to
carroll
and
then
to
the
girls
i
seen
grey
said
carroll
but
dick
juniper
held
his
tongue
and
sat
down
and
twiddled
his
hat
where
have
you
come
from
asked
georgina
from
the
brompton
road
i
come
down
on
a
you
come
from
tattersall
young
man
said
amelia
then
i
just
did
but
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
come
from
tattersall
and
it
might
be
difficult
to
follow
up
the
workings
of
his
mind
and
find
out
why
he
had
told
the
lie
of
course
it
was
known
that
when
in
london
much
of
his
business
was
done
at
tattersall
but
the
horsey
man
is
generally
on
the
alert
to
take
care
that
no
secret
of
his
trade
escapes
from
him
unawares
and
it
may
be
that
he
was
thus
prepared
for
a
gratuitous
lie
uncle
gone
a
deal
farther
than
ever
i
expected
said
amelia
he
been
most
generous
to
all
the
girls
said
carroll
moved
nearly
to
tears
juniper
did
not
care
very
much
about
all
the
girls
thinking
that
the
uncle
affection
at
the
present
moment
should
be
shown
to
the
one
girl
who
had
found
a
husband
and
thinking
also
that
if
the
husband
was
to
be
secured
the
proper
way
of
doing
so
would
be
by
liberality
to
him
amelia
had
said
that
her
uncle
had
gone
farther
than
she
expected
juniper
concluded
from
this
that
he
had
not
gone
as
far
as
he
had
been
asked
and
boldly
resolved
at
the
spur
of
the
moment
to
stand
by
his
demand
five
hundred
pounds
ai
much
he
said
dick
do
make
a
beast
of
yourself
said
amelia
upon
this
dick
only
smiled
he
continually
twiddled
his
hat
for
three
or
four
minutes
and
then
rose
up
straight
i
suppose
said
he
i
had
better
go
and
talk
to
the
old
man
i
seed
miss
sophie
taking
a
to
him
so
i
suppose
he
be
able
to
talk
why
should
he
talk
said
carroll
but
she
quite
understood
what
juniper
words
were
intended
to
imply
it
do
always
follow
said
juniper
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
now
there
be
a
row
in
the
house
you
see
if
there
is
said
amelia
but
carroll
expressed
her
opinion
that
the
man
must
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
creatures
if
he
kicked
up
a
row
on
the
present
occasion
i
do
know
so
much
about
that
mamma
said
amelia
juniper
walked
with
heavy
slow
steps
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
marital
chamber
there
are
men
who
ca
walk
as
though
to
do
so
were
an
affair
of
ordinary
life
they
perform
the
task
as
though
they
walked
once
in
three
years
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
such
men
always
sleep
on
the
though
where
they
find
their
it
is
hard
to
say
juniper
was
admitted
by
sophie
who
stepped
out
as
he
went
in
well
old
fellow
and
and
plenty
of
it
that
the
ticket
eh
i
did
have
a
little
headache
this
morning
i
think
it
was
the
cigars
very
like
and
the
stuff
as
washed
down
you
have
got
any
more
of
the
same
have
you
i
uncommonly
sorry
said
the
sick
man
rising
up
on
his
elbow
but
i
afraid
there
is
not
to
tell
the
truth
i
had
the
deuce
of
a
job
to
get
this
from
the
old
woman
it
do
matter
said
the
impassive
juniper
only
i
have
been
down
among
the
at
the
yard
till
my
throat
is
full
of
dust
so
your
lady
has
been
and
seen
her
brother
yes
she
done
that
well
he
ai
altogether
a
bad
un
is
old
grey
of
course
he
an
attorney
i
never
think
much
of
them
chaps
there
good
and
bad
juniper
no
doubt
my
has
made
a
little
money
a
pot
of
it
if
all
they
say
true
but
all
they
say
is
true
all
they
say
never
is
true
i
suppose
he
got
something
yes
he
got
something
and
how
is
it
to
be
he
given
the
girl
four
hundred
pounds
on
the
nail
upon
this
juniper
turned
up
his
nose
and
fifty
pounds
for
her
he
better
let
me
have
that
girls
think
so
much
of
it
juniper
only
shook
his
head
and
upon
my
word
it
more
than
she
had
a
right
to
expect
it
ai
what
she
had
a
right
to
expect
but
i
here
carroll
shook
his
head
i
said
five
hundred
pounds
out
and
i
means
to
hold
by
it
that
about
it
if
he
wants
to
get
the
girl
married
why
he
must
open
his
pocket
it
is
very
much
that
i
asking
i
that
sort
of
a
fellow
that
if
i
did
want
it
i
take
her
without
a
shilling
but
you
are
that
sort
of
fellow
that
always
does
want
it
i
wants
it
now
it
better
to
speak
out
ai
it
i
must
have
the
five
hundred
pounds
before
i
put
my
neck
into
the
noose
and
there
must
be
no
paring
off
for
petticoats
and
pelisses
and
grey
says
that
he
must
make
inquiries
into
character
said
carroll
into
what
into
character
he
is
going
to
give
his
money
without
knowing
something
about
the
man
i
all
straight
at
newmarket
i
ai
going
to
stand
any
inquiries
into
me
you
know
i
can
stand
inquiries
better
than
some
people
got
a
partner
named
barry
ai
he
there
is
such
a
gentleman
i
do
know
much
about
the
business
ways
of
my
respected
barry
is
i
believe
a
good
sort
of
a
man
it
he
as
is
acting
for
captain
scarborough
is
it
now
it
may
be
for
anything
i
know
then
there
came
a
long
conversation
during
which
juniper
told
some
details
of
his
former
life
and
expressed
himself
very
freely
upon
certain
points
it
appeared
that
in
the
event
of
scarborough
having
died
as
was
expected
in
the
course
of
the
early
summer
and
of
captain
scarborough
succeeding
to
the
property
in
the
accustomed
manner
juniper
would
have
been
one
of
those
who
would
have
come
forward
with
a
small
claim
upon
the
estate
he
had
lent
he
said
a
certain
sum
of
money
to
help
the
captain
in
his
embarrassment
and
expected
to
get
it
back
again
now
latterly
inquiries
had
been
made
very
disagreeable
in
their
nature
to
juniper
but
juniper
seeing
how
the
the
land
lay
to
use
his
own
phrase
consented
only
to
accept
so
much
as
he
had
advanced
it
do
make
much
difference
to
me
he
had
said
let
me
have
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
the
captain
got
in
hard
money
then
the
inquiries
were
made
by
barry
that
very
barry
to
whom
subsequent
inquiries
were
committed
and
barry
could
not
satisfy
himself
as
to
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
the
captain
was
said
to
have
got
in
hard
money
there
had
been
words
spoken
which
seemed
to
juniper
to
make
it
very
inexpedient
and
we
may
say
very
unfair
that
these
farther
inquiries
into
his
character
as
a
husband
should
be
intrusted
to
the
same
person
he
regarded
barry
as
an
enemy
to
the
human
race
from
whom
in
the
general
confusion
of
things
no
plunder
was
to
be
extracted
mr
barry
had
asked
for
the
check
by
which
the
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
had
been
paid
to
captain
scarborough
in
hard
cash
there
had
been
no
check
juniper
had
said
such
a
small
sum
as
that
had
been
paid
in
notes
at
newmarket
he
said
that
he
could
not
or
rather
that
he
would
not
produce
any
evidence
as
to
the
money
barry
had
suggested
that
even
so
small
a
sum
as
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
could
not
have
come
and
could
not
have
gone
without
leaving
some
trace
juniper
very
indignantly
had
referred
to
an
acknowledgment
on
a
for
six
hundred
pounds
which
he
had
filled
in
and
which
the
captain
had
undoubtedly
signed
it
not
worth
the
paper
it
written
on
barry
had
said
we
see
about
that
said
juniper
as
soon
as
the
breath
is
out
of
the
old
squire
body
we
see
whether
his
son
is
to
repudiate
his
debts
in
that
way
ai
that
the
captain
signature
and
he
slapped
the
bill
with
his
hand
the
old
ceremony
was
gone
through
of
explaining
that
the
captain
had
no
right
to
a
shilling
of
the
property
it
had
become
an
old
ceremony
now
augustus
scarborough
is
going
to
pay
out
of
his
own
good
will
only
those
sums
of
the
advance
of
which
he
has
indisputable
testimony
ai
he
my
testimony
of
this
said
juniper
this
bill
is
for
six
hundred
pounds
in
course
it
is
why
do
you
say
you
advanced
him
five
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
instead
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
because
i
did
why
do
you
say
three
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
instead
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
because
i
did
then
we
have
only
your
bare
word
we
are
not
going
to
pay
any
one
a
shilling
on
such
a
testimony
then
juniper
had
sworn
an
awful
oath
that
he
would
have
every
man
bearing
the
name
of
scarborough
hanged
but
barry
firm
did
not
care
much
for
any
law
proceedings
which
might
be
taken
by
juniper
alone
no
law
proceedings
would
be
taken
the
sum
to
be
regained
would
not
be
worth
the
while
of
any
lawyer
to
insure
the
hopeless
expense
of
fighting
such
a
battle
it
would
be
shown
in
court
on
barry
side
that
the
existing
owner
of
the
estate
out
of
his
own
generosity
had
repaid
all
sums
of
money
as
to
which
evidence
existed
that
they
had
been
advanced
to
the
unfortunate
illegitimate
captain
they
would
appear
with
clean
hands
but
poor
juniper
would
receive
the
sympathy
of
none
of
this
juniper
had
by
degrees
become
aware
and
was
already
looking
on
his
claim
on
the
scarborough
property
as
lost
and
now
on
this
other
little
affair
of
his
on
this
matrimonial
venture
it
was
very
hard
that
inquiries
as
to
his
character
should
be
referred
to
the
same
barry
i
d
if
i
stand
it
he
said
thumping
his
fist
down
on
carroll
bed
on
which
he
was
sitting
it
is
any
of
my
doing
i
on
the
square
with
you
i
do
know
so
much
about
that
what
have
i
done
did
i
send
her
to
the
girl
uncle
and
did
she
get
from
him
a
very
liberal
promise
promises
why
did
he
stump
up
the
rhino
what
the
good
of
promises
there
as
much
to
do
about
a
beggarly
five
hundred
pounds
as
though
it
were
fifty
thousand
pounds
inquiries
of
course
he
knew
very
well
what
that
meant
it
a
most
ungentlemanlike
thing
for
one
gentleman
to
take
upon
himself
to
make
inquiries
about
another
he
is
not
the
girl
father
what
right
has
he
to
make
inquiries
i
did
put
it
into
his
head
said
carroll
almost
sobbing
he
must
be
a
pettifogging
lawyer
he
is
a
lawyer
said
carroll
on
whose
mind
the
memory
of
the
great
benefit
he
had
received
had
made
some
impression
i
have
admitted
that
pshaw
but
i
do
think
he
pettifogging
not
grey
four
hundred
pounds
down
with
fifty
pounds
for
dress
and
the
same
or
most
the
same
to
all
the
girls
is
pettifogging
if
you
ever
comes
to
have
a
family
juniper
i
ai
in
the
way
but
when
you
are
and
there
comes
six
of
you
wo
find
an
uncle
pettifogging
when
he
speaks
out
like
mr
grey
the
conversation
was
carried
on
for
some
time
farther
and
then
juniper
left
the
house
without
again
visiting
the
ladies
his
last
word
was
that
if
inquiries
were
made
into
him
they
might
all
go
to
bath
if
the
money
were
forthcoming
they
would
know
where
to
find
him
but
it
must
be
five
hundred
pounds
square
with
no
parings
made
from
it
on
behalf
of
petticoats
and
pelisses
with
this
last
word
juniper
stamped
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
house
he
a
brute
after
all
said
sophie
no
he
is
what
do
you
know
about
brutes
of
course
a
gentleman
has
to
make
the
best
fight
he
can
for
his
money
this
was
what
amelia
said
at
the
moment
but
in
the
seclusion
of
their
own
room
she
wept
bitterly
why
did
he
come
in
to
see
me
and
just
give
me
one
word
i
done
anything
amiss
it
was
my
fault
if
uncle
john
is
stingy
and
he
is
so
very
stingy
after
all
said
sophie
of
course
papa
has
got
anything
and
would
have
anything
though
you
were
to
pour
golden
rivers
into
his
lap
there
are
worse
than
papa
said
sophie
but
he
knows
all
that
and
that
our
uncle
is
any
more
than
an
uncle
and
why
should
he
be
so
particular
just
about
a
hundred
pounds
i
do
think
gentlemen
are
the
meanest
creatures
when
they
are
looking
after
money
ladies
ai
half
so
bad
he
no
business
to
expect
five
hundred
pounds
all
out
this
was
very
melancholy
and
the
house
was
kept
in
a
state
of
silent
sorrow
for
four
or
five
days
till
the
result
of
the
inquiries
had
come
then
there
was
weeping
and
gnashing
of
teeth
barry
came
to
bolsover
terrace
to
communicate
the
result
of
the
inquiry
and
was
shut
up
for
half
an
hour
with
poor
carroll
he
was
afraid
that
he
could
not
recommend
the
match
oh
i
sorry
for
that
very
sorry
said
carroll
the
young
lady
will
be
disappointed
and
her
handkerchief
went
up
to
her
eyes
then
there
was
silence
for
awhile
till
she
asked
why
an
opinion
so
strongly
condemnatory
had
been
expressed
the
gentleman
is
not
what
a
gentleman
should
be
you
may
take
my
word
for
it
i
must
ask
you
not
to
repeat
what
i
say
to
him
oh
dear
no
but
perhaps
the
least
said
the
soonest
mended
he
is
not
what
a
gentleman
should
be
you
mean
a
fine
gentleman
he
is
not
what
a
man
should
be
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
it
would
not
be
for
the
young
lady
happiness
that
she
should
select
such
a
partner
for
her
life
she
is
very
much
attached
to
him
i
am
sorry
that
it
should
be
so
but
it
will
be
better
that
she
should
live
it
down
at
any
rate
i
am
bound
to
communicate
to
you
grey
decision
though
he
does
not
at
all
mean
to
withhold
his
bounty
in
regard
to
any
other
proposed
marriage
he
can
not
bring
himself
to
pay
money
to
mr
juniper
nothing
at
all
asked
carroll
he
will
make
no
payment
that
will
go
into
the
pocket
of
mr
juniper
then
barry
went
and
there
was
weeping
and
wailing
in
the
house
in
bolsover
terrace
so
cruel
an
uncle
as
grey
had
never
been
heard
of
in
history
or
even
in
romance
i
know
it
that
old
cat
dolly
said
amelia
because
she
has
managed
to
get
a
husband
for
herself
she
does
want
any
one
else
to
get
one
my
poor
child
said
carroll
in
a
maudlin
condition
i
pity
thee
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
wish
that
barry
may
be
made
to
marry
a
hideous
old
maid
past
forty
said
georgina
i
should
care
what
they
said
but
would
take
him
straight
off
said
sophie
upon
this
carroll
shook
her
head
i
do
suppose
that
he
is
quite
all
that
he
ought
to
be
who
is
i
should
like
to
know
said
amelia
but
my
brother
has
to
give
his
money
according
to
his
judgment
as
she
said
this
the
poor
woman
thought
of
those
other
five
who
in
process
of
time
might
become
claimants
but
here
the
whole
family
attacked
her
and
almost
drove
her
to
confess
that
her
brother
was
a
stingy
old
curmudgeon
chapter
xxxvi
gurney
malcolmson
in
red
lion
square
on
the
first
floor
of
a
house
which
partakes
of
the
general
dinginess
of
the
neighborhood
there
are
two
rooms
which
bear
on
the
outside
door
the
names
of
gurney
malcolmson
and
on
the
front
door
to
the
street
are
the
names
of
gurney
malcolmson
showing
that
the
business
transacted
by
gurney
malcolmson
outweighs
in
importance
any
others
conducted
in
the
same
house
in
the
first
room
which
is
the
smaller
of
the
two
occupied
sits
usually
a
lad
who
passes
most
of
his
time
in
making
up
and
directing
circulars
so
that
a
stranger
might
be
led
to
suppose
that
the
business
of
gurney
malcolmson
was
of
an
extended
nature
but
on
the
occasion
to
which
we
are
about
to
allude
the
door
of
the
premises
was
closed
and
the
boy
was
kept
on
the
alert
posting
or
perhaps
delivering
the
circulars
which
were
continually
issued
this
was
the
place
of
business
affected
by
tyrrwhit
or
at
any
rate
one
of
them
who
were
gurney
malcolmson
it
is
not
necessary
that
our
chronicle
should
tell
no
gurney
or
no
malcolmson
was
then
visible
and
though
a
part
of
the
business
of
the
firm
in
which
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
gurney
malcolmson
were
engaged
was
greatly
discussed
their
name
on
the
occasion
was
never
mentioned
a
meeting
had
been
called
at
which
the
presiding
genius
was
tyrrwhit
you
might
almost
be
led
to
believe
that
from
the
manner
in
which
he
made
himself
at
home
tyrrwhit
was
gurney
malcolmson
but
there
was
another
there
who
seemed
to
be
almost
as
much
at
home
as
tyrrwhit
and
this
was
samuel
hart
whom
we
last
saw
when
he
had
unexpectedly
made
himself
known
to
his
friend
the
captain
at
monaco
he
had
a
good
deal
to
say
for
himself
and
as
he
sat
during
the
meeting
with
his
hat
on
it
is
to
be
presumed
that
he
was
not
in
awe
of
his
companions
juniper
also
was
there
he
took
a
seat
at
one
corner
of
the
table
and
did
not
say
much
there
was
also
a
man
who
in
speaking
of
himself
and
his
own
affairs
always
called
himself
evans
crooke
and
there
was
one
spicer
who
sat
silent
for
the
most
part
and
looked
very
fierce
in
all
matters
however
he
appeared
to
agree
with
tyrrwhit
he
is
especially
named
as
his
interest
in
the
matter
discussed
was
large
there
were
three
or
four
others
whose
affairs
were
of
less
moment
though
to
them
they
were
of
intense
interest
these
gentlemen
assembled
were
they
who
had
advanced
money
to
captain
scarborough
and
this
was
the
meeting
of
the
captain
creditors
at
which
they
were
to
decide
whether
they
were
to
give
up
their
bonds
on
payment
of
the
sums
they
had
actually
advanced
or
whether
they
would
stand
out
till
the
old
squire
death
and
then
go
to
law
with
the
owner
of
the
estate
at
the
moment
at
which
we
may
be
presumed
to
be
introduced
tyrrwhit
had
explained
the
matter
in
a
nervous
hesitating
manner
but
still
in
words
sufficiently
clear
there
the
money
down
now
if
you
like
to
take
it
and
i
for
taking
it
these
were
the
words
with
which
tyrrwhit
completed
his
address
circumstances
is
different
said
the
man
with
his
hat
on
i
do
know
much
about
that
hart
said
tyrrwhit
circumstances
is
different
i
ca
whether
you
know
it
or
not
how
different
they
is
different
and
that
all
about
it
it
perhaps
shuit
you
and
them
other
shentlemen
to
take
a
pershentage
it
wo
suit
evans
crooke
said
the
man
who
represented
that
firm
but
perhaps
evans
crooke
may
be
willing
to
save
so
much
of
their
property
said
tyrrwhit
they
like
to
have
what
due
to
we
should
all
like
that
said
spicer
and
he
gnashed
his
teeth
and
shook
his
head
but
we
ca
get
it
all
said
tyrrwhit
speak
for
yourself
tyrrwhit
said
hart
i
think
i
can
get
mine
this
is
the
most
almighty
abandoned
swindle
i
ever
met
in
all
my
born
days
the
whole
meeting
except
tyrrwhit
received
this
assertion
with
loudly
expressed
applause
such
a
blackguard
dirty
thieving
job
never
was
up
before
in
my
time
i
do
know
to
talk
of
it
in
language
as
a
man
is
ashamed
to
commit
himself
to
it
downright
robbery
i
say
so
too
said
evans
crooke
by
george
continued
hart
we
come
forward
to
a
shentleman
in
his
trouble
and
to
wait
for
our
moneys
till
the
father
is
dead
and
then
when
our
moneys
the
father
turns
round
and
says
that
own
son
is
a
oh
it
too
shocking
i
slept
since
i
it
not
a
regular
night
rest
now
it
my
belief
the
captain
no
in
it
here
juniper
scratched
his
head
and
looked
doubtful
and
one
or
two
of
the
other
silent
gentlemen
scratched
their
heads
evans
crooke
scratched
his
head
it
a
matter
on
which
i
would
not
like
to
give
an
opinion
one
way
or
the
other
said
tyrrwhit
no
more
would
i
said
spicer
let
every
man
speak
as
he
finds
continued
hart
that
my
belief
i
do
mind
giving
up
a
little
of
my
claim
just
a
thousand
or
so
for
ready
cash
the
old
sinner
ought
to
be
dead
and
ca
last
long
my
belief
is
when
gone
i
so
circumstanced
i
shall
get
the
whole
whether
or
no
i
gone
in
for
the
captain
with
all
my
savings
and
i
mean
to
stick
to
them
and
lose
everything
said
tyrrwhit
why
do
we
go
and
lug
the
old
sinner
into
prison
said
evans
crooke
certainly
that
the
game
said
juniper
and
there
was
another
loud
acclamation
of
applause
from
the
entire
room
gentlemen
you
do
know
what
you
talking
about
you
do
indeed
said
tyrrwhit
i
do
believe
as
we
do
said
spicer
you
ca
touch
the
old
gentleman
he
owes
you
nothing
nor
have
you
a
scratch
of
his
pen
how
are
you
to
lug
an
old
gentleman
to
prison
when
he
lying
there
cut
up
by
the
doctors
almost
to
nothing
i
do
know
that
anybody
can
touch
him
the
captain
perhaps
might
if
the
present
story
be
false
and
the
younger
son
if
the
other
be
true
and
then
they
have
to
prove
it
grey
says
that
no
one
can
touch
him
he
in
the
swim
as
bad
as
any
of
said
evans
crooke
of
course
he
is
said
hart
but
let
everybody
speak
for
himself
gone
in
to
a
stake
honestly
that
all
right
said
evans
crooke
and
i
mean
to
it
or
nothing
now
tyrrwhit
you
know
a
piece
of
my
mind
it
a
biggish
lot
of
money
we
know
what
your
claim
is
but
no
man
knows
what
the
captain
got
and
i
do
mean
to
know
about
fifteen
thousand
came
in
a
whisper
from
some
one
in
the
room
that
a
lie
said
hart
so
there
no
getting
out
of
that
if
the
shentleman
will
mind
own
concerns
i
mind
mine
nobody
knows
barring
the
captain
and
he
like
enough
has
forgot
and
going
to
know
what
written
on
these
eight
bits
of
paper
everybody
may
know
and
he
pulled
out
of
a
large
case
or
purse
which
he
carried
in
his
breast
a
fat
sheaf
of
bills
there
are
five
written
on
each
of
them
and
for
five
thou
on
each
of
them
i
means
to
stand
out
or
miss
if
any
shentleman
chooses
to
talk
to
me
about
ready
money
i
take
two
thou
off
i
like
ready
money
as
well
as
another
we
can
all
say
the
same
as
that
hart
said
tyrrwhit
no
doubt
and
if
you
think
you
can
get
it
i
advise
you
to
stick
to
it
if
you
thought
you
could
get
it
you
would
say
the
same
but
i
should
like
to
get
that
old
man
between
my
fists
would
i
punch
it
thief
scoundrel
old
man
it
ai
for
myself
that
i
speaking
now
because
i
to
get
it
i
think
i
to
get
it
for
humanity
at
large
this
kind
of
thing
wiolates
one
best
feelings
said
one
of
the
silent
gentlemen
them
the
sentiments
of
evans
crooke
said
the
representative
of
that
firm
they
all
our
sentiments
in
course
said
spicer
but
what
the
use
not
a
said
tyrrwhit
asking
your
pardon
tyrrwhit
said
hart
but
as
this
is
a
meeting
of
creditors
who
a
largish
lot
of
money
to
deal
with
i
do
think
they
ought
to
part
without
expressing
their
opinions
in
the
way
of
british
commerce
i
say
crucifying
be
too
good
for
you
ca
get
at
him
to
crucify
him
there
no
knowing
about
that
said
hart
and
now
said
tyrrwhit
drawing
out
his
watch
i
expect
augustus
scarborough
to
call
upon
us
you
can
crucify
said
evans
crooke
it
is
the
old
man
and
neither
of
the
sons
as
have
done
it
said
hart
scarborough
continued
tyrrwhit
will
be
here
and
will
expect
to
learn
whether
we
have
accepted
his
offer
he
will
be
accompanied
by
barry
if
one
rejects
all
reject
not
at
all
said
hart
he
will
not
consent
to
pay
anything
unless
he
can
make
a
clean
hit
of
it
he
is
about
to
sacrifice
a
very
large
sum
of
money
sacrifice
said
juniper
yes
sacrifice
a
very
large
sum
of
money
his
father
can
not
pay
it
without
his
consent
the
father
may
die
any
day
and
then
the
money
will
belong
altogether
to
the
son
you
have
none
of
you
any
claim
upon
him
it
is
likely
he
may
think
you
will
have
a
claim
on
the
estate
not
trusting
his
own
father
i
would
trust
him
not
as
far
as
i
could
see
him
though
he
was
twice
my
father
this
again
came
from
hart
i
want
to
explain
to
these
gentlemen
how
the
matter
stands
they
understand
said
hart
i
for
securing
my
own
money
it
very
hard
after
all
the
risk
i
quite
agree
with
hart
in
what
he
says
about
the
squire
such
a
piece
of
premeditated
dishonesty
for
robbing
gentlemen
of
their
property
i
never
before
heard
it
awful
old
man
said
hart
just
so
but
half
a
loaf
is
better
than
no
bread
now
here
is
a
list
prepared
in
grey
chambers
another
nigh
as
on
this
list
we
all
down
with
the
sums
he
says
we
advanced
are
we
to
take
them
if
so
we
must
sign
our
names
each
to
his
own
figure
then
he
passed
the
list
down
the
table
the
men
there
assembled
all
crowded
to
look
at
the
list
and
among
others
juniper
he
showed
his
anxiety
by
the
eager
way
in
which
he
nearly
annihilated
evans
crooke
by
leaning
over
him
as
he
struggled
to
read
the
paper
your
name
ai
down
at
all
said
evans
crooke
then
a
tremendous
oath
very
bitter
and
very
wicked
came
from
the
mouth
of
juniper
most
unbefitting
a
young
man
engaged
to
marry
a
young
lady
i
tell
you
it
is
here
said
evans
crooke
trying
to
extricate
himself
i
shall
know
how
to
right
myself
said
juniper
with
another
oath
and
he
then
walked
out
of
the
room
the
captain
when
he
was
drunk
one
night
got
a
couple
of
ponies
from
him
it
was
a
couple
all
out
and
juniper
made
him
write
his
name
for
five
hundred
pounds
it
was
thought
then
that
the
squire
have
been
dead
next
day
and
juniper
got
a
good
thing
i
them
ways
said
hart
i
never
deal
with
a
shentleman
if
he
to
say
drunk
of
course
it
comes
in
my
way
but
i
never
does
now
there
was
heard
a
sound
of
steps
on
the
stairs
and
tyrrwhit
rose
from
his
chair
so
as
to
perform
the
duty
of
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
the
gentlemen
who
were
expected
augustus
scarborough
entered
the
room
followed
by
barry
they
were
received
with
considerable
respect
and
seated
on
two
chairs
at
tyrrwhit
right
hand
gentlemen
you
most
of
you
know
these
two
gentlemen
they
are
augustus
scarborough
and
barry
junior
partner
in
the
firm
of
grey
barry
we
knows
said
hart
my
client
has
made
a
proposition
to
you
said
barry
if
you
will
give
up
your
bonds
against
his
brother
which
are
not
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
on
gammon
said
hart
i
will
sign
checks
paying
to
you
the
sums
of
money
written
on
that
list
but
you
must
all
agree
to
accept
such
sums
in
liquidation
in
full
i
see
you
have
not
signed
the
paper
yet
no
time
is
to
be
lost
in
fact
you
must
sign
it
now
or
my
client
will
withdraw
from
his
offer
withdraw
will
said
hart
suppose
we
withdraw
does
your
client
think
is
the
honestest
man
in
this
swim
barry
seemed
somewhat
abashed
by
this
question
it
is
necessary
to
go
into
that
hart
said
he
hart
laughed
long
and
loud
and
all
the
gentlemen
laughed
there
was
something
to
them
extremely
jocose
in
their
occupying
as
it
were
the
other
side
of
the
question
and
appearing
as
the
honest
injured
party
they
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
and
hart
was
disposed
to
make
the
most
of
it
no
it
ai
necessary
is
it
there
ai
no
question
of
honesty
to
be
asked
in
this
business
we
quite
understand
that
then
up
and
spoke
augustus
scarborough
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
the
very
fact
of
his
doing
so
quieted
for
a
time
the
exuberant
mirth
of
the
party
gentlemen
hart
speaks
to
you
of
honesty
i
am
not
going
to
boast
of
my
own
i
am
here
to
consent
to
the
expenditure
of
a
very
large
sum
of
money
for
which
i
am
to
get
nothing
and
which
if
not
paid
to
you
will
all
go
into
my
own
pocket
unless
you
believed
that
you
would
be
here
to
meet
me
we
do
believe
nothing
said
hart
hart
you
should
let
scarborough
speak
said
tyrrwhit
vell
let
speak
vat
the
odds
i
do
not
wish
to
delay
you
nor
to
delay
myself
continued
augustus
i
can
go
and
will
go
at
once
but
i
shall
not
come
back
there
is
no
good
discussing
this
matter
any
longer
oh
no
not
the
least
ve
do
like
discussion
do
ve
captain
said
hart
but
you
ai
the
captain
is
you
as
there
seems
to
be
no
intention
of
signing
that
document
i
shall
go
said
augustus
then
tyrrwhit
took
the
paper
and
signed
it
on
the
first
line
with
his
own
name
at
full
length
he
wrote
his
name
to
a
very
serious
sum
of
money
but
it
was
less
than
half
what
he
and
others
had
expected
to
receive
when
the
sum
was
lent
had
that
been
realized
there
would
have
been
no
farther
need
for
the
formalities
of
gurney
malcolmson
and
that
young
lad
must
have
found
other
work
to
do
than
the
posting
of
circulars
the
whole
matter
however
had
been
much
considered
and
he
signed
the
document
hart
name
came
next
but
he
passed
it
on
i
ai
made
up
my
mind
yet
maybe
i
shall
have
to
call
on
barry
i
ai
just
consulted
my
partner
then
the
document
went
down
to
spicer
who
signed
it
grinning
horribly
as
did
also
evans
crooke
and
all
the
others
they
did
believe
that
was
the
only
way
in
which
they
could
get
back
the
money
they
had
advanced
it
was
a
great
misfortune
a
serious
blow
but
in
this
way
there
was
something
short
of
ruin
they
knew
that
scarborough
was
about
to
pay
the
money
so
that
he
might
escape
a
lawsuit
which
might
go
against
him
but
then
they
also
wished
to
avoid
the
necessity
of
bringing
the
lawsuit
looking
at
the
matter
all
round
we
may
say
that
the
lawyers
were
the
persons
most
aggrieved
by
what
was
done
on
that
morning
they
all
signed
it
as
they
sat
there
except
hart
who
passed
it
on
and
still
wore
his
hat
you
wo
agree
mr
hart
said
tyrrwhit
not
yet
i
vo
said
hart
i
ai
thought
it
out
i
ai
in
the
same
boat
with
the
rest
i
not
afraid
of
my
money
i
shall
get
that
all
right
then
i
may
as
well
go
said
augustus
do
be
in
a
hurry
scarborough
said
tyrrwhit
things
of
this
kind
ca
be
done
just
in
a
moment
but
augustus
explained
that
they
must
be
done
in
a
very
few
moments
if
they
were
to
be
done
at
all
it
was
not
his
intention
to
sit
there
in
gurney
malcolmson
office
discussing
the
matter
with
hart
notice
of
his
intention
had
been
given
and
they
might
take
his
money
or
leave
it
just
so
captain
said
hart
only
i
believe
you
ai
the
captain
where
the
captain
now
i
see
him
last
at
monte
carlo
and
he
had
won
a
pot
of
money
he
was
looking
uncommon
well
after
his
little
accident
in
the
streets
with
young
annesley
tyrrwhit
contrived
to
get
all
the
others
out
of
the
room
he
remaining
there
with
hart
and
augustus
scarborough
and
barry
and
then
hart
did
sign
the
document
with
altered
figures
only
that
so
much
was
added
on
to
the
sum
which
he
agreed
to
accept
and
a
similar
deduction
made
from
that
to
which
tyrrwhit
name
was
signed
but
this
was
not
done
without
renewed
expostulation
from
the
latter
gentleman
it
was
very
hard
he
said
that
all
the
sacrifice
should
be
made
by
him
he
would
be
ruined
utterly
ruined
by
the
transaction
but
he
did
sign
for
the
altered
sum
and
hart
also
signed
the
paper
now
barry
as
the
matter
is
completed
i
think
i
will
withdraw
said
augustus
it
five
thousand
pounds
clean
gone
out
of
my
pocket
said
hart
and
i
vas
as
sure
of
it
as
ever
i
vas
in
my
life
there
vas
no
better
money
than
the
captain
vell
vell
this
vorld
a
queer
place
so
saying
he
followed
augustus
and
barry
out
of
the
room
and
left
tyrrwhit
alone
in
his
misery
chapter
xxxvii
victoria
street
lounging
in
an
in
a
small
but
luxuriously
furnished
room
in
victoria
street
sat
captain
mountjoy
scarborough
and
opposite
to
him
equally
comfortably
placed
as
far
as
externals
were
concerned
but
without
any
of
that
lounging
look
which
the
captain
affected
sat
his
brother
it
was
nearly
eight
and
the
sound
of
the
could
be
heard
through
the
open
doors
from
the
next
room
it
was
evident
or
at
any
rate
was
the
fact
that
augustus
found
his
presence
a
bore
and
as
evident
that
the
captain
intended
to
disregard
the
dissatisfaction
evinced
by
the
owner
of
the
chambers
do
shut
the
door
mountjoy
said
the
younger
i
do
suppose
we
want
the
servant
to
hear
everything
that
we
say
he
welcome
for
me
said
mountjoy
without
moving
then
augustus
got
up
and
banged
the
door
do
be
angry
because
i
sometimes
forget
that
i
am
no
longer
considered
to
be
your
elder
brother
said
mountjoy
bother
about
elder
brothers
i
suppose
you
can
shut
a
door
a
man
is
sometimes
compelled
by
circumstances
to
think
whether
he
can
or
not
shut
the
door
for
you
readily
enough
the
other
day
i
do
know
that
i
can
now
ai
we
going
to
have
some
dinner
eight
i
suppose
they
get
dinner
for
you
i
not
going
to
dine
here
the
two
men
were
both
dressed
and
after
this
they
remained
silent
for
the
next
five
minutes
then
the
servant
came
in
and
said
that
dinner
was
ready
all
this
happened
in
december
it
must
be
explained
that
the
captain
had
come
to
london
at
his
brother
instance
and
was
there
in
his
rooms
at
his
invitation
indeed
we
may
say
that
he
had
come
at
his
command
augustus
had
during
the
last
few
months
taken
upon
himself
to
direct
the
captain
movements
and
though
he
had
not
always
been
obeyed
still
upon
the
whole
his
purposes
had
been
carried
out
as
well
as
he
could
expect
he
had
offered
to
supply
the
money
necessary
for
the
captain
tour
and
had
absolutely
sent
a
servant
to
accompany
the
traveller
when
the
traveller
had
won
money
at
monaco
he
had
been
unruly
but
this
had
not
happened
very
often
when
we
last
saw
him
he
had
expressed
his
intention
to
hart
of
making
a
return
journey
to
the
caucasian
provinces
but
he
got
no
farther
than
genoa
on
his
way
to
the
caucasus
and
then
when
he
found
that
hart
was
not
at
his
back
he
turned
round
and
went
back
to
monte
carlo
monte
carlo
of
all
places
on
the
world
surface
had
now
charms
for
him
there
was
no
longer
a
club
open
to
him
either
in
london
or
paris
at
which
he
could
win
or
lose
one
hundred
pounds
at
monte
carlo
he
could
still
do
so
readily
and
to
do
so
need
not
sink
down
into
any
peculiarly
low
depth
of
social
gathering
at
monte
carlo
the
of
the
day
was
made
to
disappear
at
monte
carlo
he
could
lie
in
bed
till
eleven
and
then
play
till
at
monte
carlo
there
was
always
some
one
who
would
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
him
without
inquiring
too
closely
as
to
his
antecedents
he
had
begun
by
winning
a
large
sum
of
money
he
had
got
some
sums
from
his
brother
and
when
at
last
he
was
summoned
home
he
was
penniless
had
his
pocket
been
still
full
of
money
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
would
have
come
although
he
understood
perfectly
the
importance
of
the
matter
on
which
he
had
been
recalled
he
had
been
sent
for
in
order
that
he
might
receive
from
grey
a
clear
statement
of
what
it
was
intended
to
do
in
reference
to
the
payment
of
money
to
the
creditors
grey
had
in
the
first
place
endeavored
to
assure
him
that
his
was
in
no
respect
made
necessary
by
the
true
circumstances
of
the
case
but
in
order
to
satisfy
the
doubts
of
certain
persons
the
money
to
be
paid
was
the
joint
property
of
his
father
and
his
brother
of
his
father
as
far
as
the
use
of
it
for
his
life
was
concerned
and
of
his
brother
as
to
its
continued
and
perpetual
enjoyment
they
were
willing
to
pay
so
much
for
the
redemption
of
the
bonds
given
by
him
the
captain
as
far
as
these
bonds
were
concerned
the
captain
would
thus
be
a
free
man
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
nothing
but
benefit
was
intended
for
him
as
though
he
were
himself
the
heir
though
as
to
that
i
have
no
hesitation
in
telling
you
that
you
will
at
your
father
death
have
no
right
to
a
shilling
of
the
property
the
captain
had
said
that
he
was
quite
willing
and
had
signed
the
deed
he
was
glad
that
these
bonds
should
be
recovered
so
cheaply
but
as
to
the
property
and
here
he
spoke
with
much
spirit
to
grey
it
was
his
purpose
at
his
father
death
to
endeavor
to
regain
his
position
he
would
never
believe
he
said
that
his
mother
was
then
he
turned
away
and
in
spite
of
all
that
had
come
and
gone
grey
respected
him
but
he
had
signed
the
deed
and
the
necessity
for
his
presence
was
over
what
should
his
brother
do
with
him
now
he
could
not
keep
him
concealed
or
not
concealed
in
his
rooms
but
something
must
be
done
some
mode
of
living
must
be
invented
for
him
abroad
augustus
said
to
himself
and
to
septimus
jones
who
was
his
confidential
friend
that
mountjoy
must
live
abroad
oh
yes
he
must
go
abroad
there
no
doubt
about
that
it
the
only
place
for
him
so
spoke
septimus
jones
who
though
confidential
friend
was
not
admitted
to
the
post
of
confidential
adviser
augustus
liked
to
have
a
depositary
for
his
resolutions
but
would
admit
no
advice
and
septimus
jones
had
become
so
much
his
creature
that
he
had
to
obey
him
in
all
things
we
are
apt
to
think
that
a
man
may
be
disposed
of
by
being
made
to
go
abroad
or
if
he
is
absolutely
penniless
and
useless
by
being
sent
to
the
colonies
that
he
may
become
a
shepherd
and
drink
himself
out
of
the
world
to
kill
the
man
so
that
he
may
be
no
longer
a
nuisance
is
perhaps
the
chief
object
in
both
cases
but
it
was
not
easy
to
get
the
captain
to
go
abroad
unless
indeed
he
was
sent
back
to
monte
carlo
some
monte
carlo
such
as
a
club
might
be
with
stakes
practically
unlimited
was
the
first
desire
of
his
heart
but
behind
that
or
together
with
it
was
an
anxious
longing
to
remain
near
tretton
and
see
it
out
as
he
called
it
when
his
father
should
die
his
father
must
die
very
shortly
and
he
would
like
to
see
it
out
as
he
told
grey
and
with
this
wish
there
was
a
longing
also
for
the
company
of
florence
mountjoy
he
used
to
tell
himself
in
those
moments
of
sad
thoughts
thoughts
serious
as
well
as
sad
which
will
come
even
to
a
gambler
that
if
he
could
have
tretton
and
florence
mountjoy
he
would
never
touch
another
card
and
there
was
present
to
him
an
assurance
that
his
aunt
mountjoy
would
still
be
on
his
side
if
he
could
talk
over
his
circumstances
with
mountjoy
he
thought
that
he
might
be
encouraged
to
recover
his
position
as
an
english
gentleman
his
debts
at
the
club
had
already
been
paid
and
he
had
met
on
the
sly
a
former
friend
who
had
given
him
some
hope
that
he
might
be
but
at
the
present
moment
his
mind
turned
to
brussels
he
had
learned
that
florence
and
her
mother
were
at
the
embassy
there
and
though
he
hesitated
still
he
desired
to
go
but
this
was
not
the
abroad
contemplated
by
augustus
augustus
did
not
think
it
well
that
his
father
bastard
son
who
had
been
turned
out
of
a
london
club
for
not
paying
his
card
debts
and
had
then
disappeared
in
a
mysterious
way
for
six
months
should
show
himself
at
the
british
embassy
and
there
claim
admittance
and
relationship
nor
was
he
anxious
that
his
brother
should
see
florence
mountjoy
he
had
suggested
a
prolonged
tour
in
south
america
which
he
had
declared
to
be
the
most
interesting
country
in
the
world
i
think
i
had
rather
go
to
brussels
mountjoy
had
answered
gallantly
keeping
his
seat
in
the
and
picking
his
teeth
the
while
this
occurred
on
the
evening
before
that
on
which
we
found
them
just
now
on
the
morning
of
that
day
mountjoy
had
had
his
interview
with
grey
augustus
had
declared
that
he
intended
to
dine
out
this
he
had
said
in
disgust
at
his
brother
behavior
no
doubt
he
could
get
his
dinner
at
ten
minutes
notice
he
had
not
been
expelled
from
his
club
but
he
had
ordered
the
dinner
on
that
day
with
a
view
to
eat
it
himself
and
in
effect
he
carried
out
his
purpose
the
captain
got
up
thinking
to
go
alone
when
the
dinner
was
announced
but
expressed
himself
gratified
when
his
brother
said
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
you
made
yourself
such
an
ass
about
shutting
the
door
that
i
resolved
to
leave
you
to
yourself
but
come
along
and
he
accompanied
the
captain
into
the
other
room
a
very
pretty
little
dinner
was
prepared
quite
such
as
one
loving
friend
might
give
to
another
when
means
are
sufficient
such
a
dinner
as
the
heir
of
tretton
might
have
given
to
his
younger
brother
the
champagne
was
excellent
and
the
bottle
of
leoville
mountjoy
partook
of
all
the
good
things
with
much
gusto
thinking
all
the
while
that
he
ought
to
have
been
giving
the
dinner
to
his
younger
brother
when
that
conversation
had
sprung
up
about
going
to
brussels
or
south
america
mountjoy
had
suggested
a
loan
i
pay
your
fare
to
rio
and
give
you
an
order
on
a
banker
there
mountjoy
had
replied
that
that
would
not
at
all
suit
his
purpose
then
augustus
had
felt
that
it
would
be
almost
better
to
send
his
brother
even
to
brussels
than
to
keep
him
concealed
in
london
he
had
been
there
now
for
three
or
four
days
and
even
in
respect
of
his
maintenance
had
become
a
burden
the
pretty
little
dinners
had
to
be
found
every
day
and
were
eaten
by
the
captain
alone
when
left
alone
without
an
attempt
at
an
apology
on
his
part
augustus
had
begun
with
some
intention
of
exhibiting
his
mode
of
life
he
would
let
his
brother
know
what
it
was
to
be
the
heir
of
tretton
no
doubt
he
did
assume
all
the
outward
glitter
of
his
position
expecting
to
fill
his
brother
heart
with
envy
but
mountjoy
had
seen
and
understood
it
all
and
remembering
the
days
not
long
removed
when
he
had
been
the
heir
he
bethought
himself
that
he
had
never
shown
off
before
his
brother
and
he
was
determined
to
express
no
gratitude
or
thankfulness
he
would
go
on
eating
the
little
dinners
exactly
as
though
they
had
been
furnished
by
himself
it
certainly
was
dull
there
was
no
occupation
for
him
and
in
the
matter
of
he
was
lamentably
but
he
was
gradually
becoming
used
to
face
the
streets
again
and
had
already
entered
the
shops
of
one
or
two
of
his
old
tradesmen
he
had
quite
a
confidential
conversation
with
his
and
had
ordered
three
or
four
new
pairs
of
boots
nobody
could
tell
how
the
question
of
the
property
would
be
decided
till
his
father
should
have
died
his
father
had
treated
him
most
cruelly
and
he
would
only
wait
for
his
death
he
could
assure
the
that
when
that
time
came
he
should
look
for
his
rights
he
knew
that
there
was
a
suspicion
abroad
that
he
was
in
a
conspiracy
with
his
father
and
brother
to
cheat
his
creditors
no
such
thing
he
himself
was
cheated
he
pledged
himself
to
the
that
to
the
best
of
his
belief
his
father
was
robbing
him
and
that
he
would
undoubtedly
assert
his
right
to
the
tretton
property
as
soon
as
the
breath
should
be
out
of
his
father
body
the
truth
of
what
he
told
the
he
certainly
did
believe
there
was
some
little
garnishing
added
to
his
tale
which
perhaps
under
the
circumstances
was
to
be
forgiven
the
blow
had
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
he
said
that
he
was
not
able
even
to
pay
his
card
account
and
had
left
town
in
dismay
at
the
mine
which
had
been
exploded
under
his
feet
the
believed
him
so
far
that
he
undertook
to
supply
his
orders
when
the
dinner
had
been
eaten
the
two
brothers
lit
their
cigars
and
drew
to
the
fire
there
must
unfortunately
come
an
end
to
this
you
know
said
augustus
i
certainly
ca
stand
it
much
longer
said
mountjoy
you
at
any
rate
have
had
the
best
of
it
i
have
endeavored
to
make
my
little
crib
comfortable
for
you
the
grub
is
good
and
the
wine
there
no
doubt
about
that
somebody
says
somewhere
that
nobody
can
live
upon
bread
alone
that
includes
the
whole
i
suppose
what
do
you
suggest
to
do
with
yourself
you
said
go
abroad
so
i
did
to
rio
rio
is
a
long
way
off
somewhere
across
the
equator
is
it
i
believe
it
is
i
think
we
better
have
it
out
clearly
between
us
augustus
it
suit
me
to
be
at
rio
janeiro
when
our
father
dies
what
difference
will
his
death
make
to
you
a
father
death
generally
does
make
a
difference
to
his
eldest
son
particularly
if
there
is
any
property
concerned
you
mean
to
say
that
you
intend
to
dispute
the
circumstances
of
your
birth
dispute
them
do
you
think
that
i
will
allow
such
a
thing
to
be
said
of
my
mother
without
disputing
it
do
you
suppose
that
i
will
give
up
my
claim
to
one
of
the
finest
properties
in
england
without
disputing
it
then
i
had
better
stop
the
payment
of
that
money
and
let
the
gentlemen
know
that
you
mean
to
raise
the
question
on
their
behalf
that
your
affair
the
arrangement
is
a
very
good
one
for
me
but
you
made
it
you
know
very
well
that
your
present
threat
means
nothing
ask
grey
you
can
trust
him
but
i
ca
trust
him
after
having
been
so
wickedly
deceived
by
my
own
father
i
can
trust
no
one
why
did
not
grey
find
it
out
before
if
it
be
true
i
give
you
my
word
augustus
the
lawyers
will
have
to
fight
it
out
before
you
will
be
allowed
to
take
possession
and
yet
you
do
not
scruple
to
come
and
live
here
at
my
cost
not
in
the
least
at
whose
cost
can
i
live
with
less
scruple
than
at
yours
you
at
any
rate
have
not
robbed
our
mother
of
her
good
name
as
my
father
has
done
the
only
one
of
the
family
with
whom
i
could
not
stay
is
the
governor
i
could
not
sit
at
the
table
with
a
man
who
has
so
disgraced
himself
upon
my
word
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
honor
you
do
me
that
my
feeling
the
chance
of
the
game
and
his
villany
have
given
you
for
the
moment
the
possession
of
all
the
good
things
they
are
all
mine
by
rights
cards
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
yes
they
have
but
they
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
my
being
the
eldest
legitimate
son
of
my
father
the
cards
have
been
against
me
but
they
have
not
affected
my
mother
then
there
came
the
blow
from
the
governor
and
where
was
i
to
look
for
my
bread
but
to
you
i
suppose
if
the
truth
be
known
you
get
the
money
from
the
governor
of
course
i
do
but
not
for
your
maintenance
on
what
does
he
suppose
that
i
have
been
living
since
last
june
it
may
be
in
the
bond
but
i
suppose
he
has
made
allowance
for
my
maintenance
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
am
not
to
have
out
of
tretton
if
i
were
to
turn
you
out
of
these
rooms
you
find
it
very
difficult
to
get
it
i
do
think
you
do
that
i
not
so
sure
you
meditating
it
are
you
i
should
go
just
at
present
because
i
have
not
got
a
sovereign
in
the
world
i
was
going
to
speak
to
you
about
money
you
must
let
me
have
some
upon
my
word
i
like
your
impudence
what
the
devil
am
i
to
do
the
governor
has
asked
me
to
go
down
to
tretton
and
i
ca
go
without
a
note
in
my
pocket
the
governor
has
asked
you
to
tretton
why
not
i
got
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
then
augustus
asked
to
see
the
letter
but
mountjoy
refused
to
show
it
from
this
there
arose
angry
words
and
augustus
told
his
brother
that
he
did
not
believe
him
not
believe
me
you
do
believe
me
you
know
that
what
i
say
is
the
truth
he
has
asked
me
with
all
his
usual
soft
soap
but
i
have
refused
to
go
i
told
him
that
i
could
not
go
to
the
house
of
one
who
had
injured
my
mother
so
seriously
all
that
mountjoy
said
as
to
the
proposed
visit
to
tretton
was
true
the
squire
had
written
to
him
without
mentioning
the
name
of
augustus
and
had
told
him
that
for
the
present
tretton
would
be
the
best
home
for
him
i
will
do
what
i
can
to
make
you
happy
but
you
will
not
see
a
card
the
squire
had
said
it
was
not
the
want
of
cards
which
prevented
mountjoy
but
a
feeling
on
his
part
that
for
the
future
there
could
be
nothing
but
war
between
him
and
his
father
it
was
out
of
the
question
that
he
should
accept
his
father
hospitality
without
telling
him
of
his
intention
and
he
did
not
know
his
father
well
enough
to
feel
that
such
a
declaration
would
not
affect
him
at
all
he
had
therefore
declined
then
harry
annesley
name
was
mentioned
i
think
i
done
for
that
fellow
said
augustus
what
have
you
done
i
cooked
his
goose
in
the
first
place
his
uncle
has
stopped
his
allowance
and
in
the
second
place
the
old
fellow
is
going
to
marry
a
wife
at
any
rate
he
has
quarrelled
with
master
harry
master
harry
has
gone
back
to
the
parental
parsonage
and
is
there
eating
the
bread
of
affliction
and
drinking
the
waters
of
poverty
flossy
mountjoy
may
marry
him
if
she
pleases
a
girl
may
marry
a
man
now
without
leave
from
anybody
but
if
she
does
my
dear
cousin
will
have
nothing
to
eat
and
you
have
done
this
i
did
it
boy
then
it
an
infernal
shame
what
harm
had
he
ever
done
you
for
me
i
had
some
ground
of
quarrel
with
him
but
for
you
there
was
none
i
have
my
own
quarrel
with
him
also
i
quarrelled
with
him
with
a
cause
i
do
not
care
if
i
quarrel
with
him
again
he
shall
never
marry
florence
mountjoy
if
i
can
help
it
but
to
rob
a
fellow
of
his
property
i
think
a
very
shabby
thing
then
augustus
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
chambers
into
the
street
and
mountjoy
soon
followed
him
i
must
make
him
understand
that
he
must
leave
this
at
once
said
augustus
to
himself
and
if
necessary
i
must
order
the
supplies
to
be
cut
off
chapter
xxxviii
the
scarborough
correspondence
it
was
as
mountjoy
had
said
the
squire
had
written
to
him
a
letter
inviting
him
to
tretton
and
telling
him
that
it
would
be
the
best
home
for
him
till
death
should
have
put
tretton
into
other
hands
mountjoy
had
thought
the
matter
over
sitting
in
the
in
his
room
and
had
at
last
declined
the
invitation
as
his
letter
was
emblematic
of
the
man
it
may
be
as
well
to
give
it
to
the
reader
my
dear
father
i
do
think
it
will
suit
me
to
go
down
to
tretton
at
present
i
do
mind
the
cards
and
i
do
doubt
that
you
would
make
it
better
than
this
place
but
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
believe
a
word
of
what
you
have
told
to
the
world
about
my
mother
and
some
of
these
days
i
mean
to
have
it
out
with
augustus
i
shall
not
sit
quietly
by
and
see
tretton
taken
out
of
my
mouth
therefore
i
think
i
had
better
not
go
to
tretton
yours
truly
mountjoy
scarborough
this
had
not
at
all
surprised
the
father
and
had
not
in
the
least
angered
him
he
rather
liked
his
son
for
standing
up
for
his
mother
and
was
by
no
means
offended
at
the
expression
of
his
son
incredulity
but
what
was
there
in
the
prospect
of
a
future
lawsuit
to
prevent
his
son
coming
to
tretton
there
need
be
no
word
spoken
as
to
the
property
tretton
would
be
infinitely
more
comfortable
than
those
rooms
in
victoria
street
and
he
was
aware
that
the
hospitality
of
victoria
street
would
not
be
given
in
an
ungrudging
spirit
i
should
like
it
said
the
old
squire
to
himself
as
he
lay
quiet
on
his
sofa
i
should
like
at
all
to
be
the
humble
guest
of
augustus
augustus
would
certainly
say
a
nasty
word
or
two
the
old
man
knew
his
younger
son
well
and
he
had
known
too
the
character
of
his
elder
son
but
he
had
not
calculated
enough
on
the
change
which
must
have
been
made
by
such
a
revelation
as
he
his
father
had
made
to
him
mountjoy
had
felt
that
all
the
world
was
against
him
and
that
as
best
he
might
he
would
make
use
of
all
the
world
excepting
only
his
father
who
of
all
the
world
was
the
falsest
and
the
most
cruel
as
for
his
brother
he
would
bleed
his
brother
to
the
very
last
drop
without
any
compunction
every
bottle
of
champagne
that
came
into
the
house
was
to
mountjoy
thinking
his
own
bought
with
his
money
and
therefore
fit
to
be
enjoyed
by
him
but
as
for
his
father
he
doubted
whether
he
could
remain
with
his
father
without
flying
at
his
throat
the
old
man
decidedly
preferred
his
elder
son
of
the
two
he
had
found
that
augustus
could
not
bear
success
and
had
first
come
to
dislike
him
and
then
to
hate
him
what
had
he
not
done
for
augustus
and
with
what
a
return
no
doubt
augustus
had
till
the
spring
of
this
present
year
been
kept
in
the
background
but
no
injury
had
come
to
him
from
that
his
father
of
his
own
good
will
with
infinite
labor
and
successful
ingenuity
had
struggled
to
put
him
back
in
the
place
which
had
been
taken
from
him
augustus
might
not
unnaturally
have
expressed
himself
as
angry
he
had
not
done
so
but
had
made
himself
persistently
disagreeable
and
had
continued
to
show
that
he
was
waiting
impatiently
for
his
father
death
it
had
come
to
pass
that
at
their
last
meeting
he
had
hardly
scrupled
to
tell
his
father
that
the
world
would
be
no
world
for
him
till
his
father
had
left
it
this
was
the
reward
which
the
old
man
received
for
having
struggled
to
provide
handsomely
and
luxuriously
for
his
son
he
still
made
his
son
a
sufficient
allowance
befitting
the
heir
of
a
man
of
large
property
but
he
had
resolved
never
to
see
him
again
it
was
true
that
he
almost
hated
him
and
thoroughly
despised
him
but
since
the
departure
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
his
eldest
son
his
regard
for
the
sinner
had
returned
he
had
become
apparently
a
hopeless
gambler
his
debts
had
been
paid
and
repaid
at
last
the
squire
had
learned
that
mountjoy
owed
so
much
on
that
the
farther
payment
of
them
was
an
impossibility
there
was
no
way
of
saving
him
to
save
the
property
he
must
undo
the
doings
of
his
early
youth
and
prove
that
the
elder
son
was
illegitimate
he
had
still
kept
the
proofs
and
he
did
it
to
the
great
disgust
of
grey
to
the
dismay
of
creditors
to
the
incredulous
wonder
of
augustus
and
almost
to
the
annihilation
of
mountjoy
himself
he
had
done
it
but
there
had
been
nothing
in
mountjoy
conduct
which
had
in
truth
wounded
him
mountjoy
vices
had
been
dangerous
destructive
absurdly
foolish
but
not
to
his
father
a
shame
he
ridiculed
gambling
as
a
source
of
excitement
no
man
could
win
much
without
dishonest
practices
and
fraud
at
cards
would
certainly
be
detected
but
he
did
not
on
that
account
hate
cards
there
was
no
reason
why
mountjoy
should
not
become
to
him
as
pleasant
a
companion
as
ever
for
the
few
days
that
might
be
left
to
him
if
only
he
would
come
but
when
asked
he
refused
to
come
when
the
squire
received
the
letter
above
given
he
was
not
in
the
least
angry
with
his
son
but
simply
determined
if
possible
that
he
should
be
brought
to
tretton
mountjoy
debts
would
now
be
paid
and
something
if
possible
should
be
done
for
him
he
was
so
angry
with
augustus
that
he
would
if
possible
revoke
his
last
decision
but
that
alas
would
be
impossible
sir
william
brodrick
had
when
he
last
saw
him
expressed
some
hope
not
of
his
recovery
which
was
by
all
admitted
to
be
impossible
but
of
his
continuance
in
the
land
of
the
living
for
another
three
months
or
perhaps
six
as
sir
william
had
finally
suggested
opening
out
as
he
himself
seemed
to
think
indefinite
hope
the
most
wonderful
constitution
scarborough
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
never
known
a
dog
even
so
cut
about
and
yet
bear
it
scarborough
bowed
and
smiled
and
accepted
the
compliment
he
would
have
taken
the
hat
off
his
head
had
it
been
his
practice
to
wear
a
hat
in
his
merton
had
gone
farther
of
course
he
did
not
mean
he
said
to
set
up
his
opinion
against
sir
william
but
if
scarborough
would
live
strictly
by
rule
merton
did
not
see
why
either
three
months
or
six
should
be
the
end
of
it
scarborough
had
replied
that
he
could
not
undertake
to
live
precisely
by
rule
and
merton
had
shaken
his
head
but
from
that
time
forth
scarborough
did
endeavor
to
obey
the
injunctions
given
to
him
he
had
something
worth
doing
in
the
six
months
now
offered
to
him
he
had
heard
lately
very
much
of
the
story
of
harry
annesley
and
had
expressed
great
anger
at
the
to
which
that
young
man
had
been
subjected
it
had
come
to
his
ears
that
it
was
intended
that
harry
should
lose
the
property
he
had
expected
and
that
he
had
already
lost
his
immediate
income
this
had
come
to
him
through
merton
between
whom
and
augustus
scarborough
there
was
no
close
friendship
and
the
squire
understood
that
florence
mountjoy
had
been
the
cause
of
misfortune
he
himself
recognized
it
as
a
fact
that
his
son
mountjoy
was
unfit
to
marry
any
young
lady
starvation
would
assuredly
stare
such
young
lady
in
the
face
but
not
the
less
was
he
acerbated
and
disgusted
at
the
idea
that
augustus
should
endeavor
to
take
the
young
lady
to
himself
what
he
had
exclaimed
to
merton
he
wants
both
the
property
and
the
girl
there
is
nothing
on
earth
that
he
does
not
want
the
greater
the
impropriety
in
his
craving
the
stronger
the
craving
then
he
picked
up
by
degrees
all
the
details
of
the
midnight
feud
between
harry
and
mountjoy
and
set
himself
to
work
to
undermine
augustus
but
he
had
steadily
carried
out
the
plan
for
settling
with
the
creditors
and
with
the
aid
of
grey
had
as
he
thought
already
concluded
that
business
conjunction
with
augustus
had
been
necessary
but
that
had
been
obtained
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
that
at
the
present
moment
of
his
life
the
idea
of
doing
some
injury
to
augustus
was
the
one
object
which
exercised
scarborough
mind
since
he
had
fallen
into
business
relations
with
his
younger
son
he
had
become
convinced
that
a
more
detestable
young
man
did
not
exist
the
reader
will
perhaps
agree
with
scarborough
but
it
can
hardly
be
hoped
that
he
should
entertain
the
opinion
as
strongly
augustus
was
now
the
recognized
eldest
legitimate
son
of
the
squire
and
as
the
property
was
entailed
it
must
no
doubt
belong
to
him
but
the
squire
was
turning
in
his
mind
all
means
of
depriving
that
condition
as
far
as
was
possible
of
its
glory
when
he
had
first
heard
of
the
injury
that
had
been
done
to
harry
annesley
he
thought
that
he
would
leave
to
our
hero
all
the
furniture
all
the
gems
all
the
books
all
the
wine
all
the
cattle
which
were
accumulated
at
tretton
augustus
should
have
the
bare
acres
and
still
barer
house
but
nothing
else
in
thinking
of
this
he
had
been
actuated
by
a
conviction
that
it
would
be
useless
for
him
to
leave
them
to
mountjoy
whatever
might
be
left
to
mountjoy
would
in
fact
be
left
to
the
creditors
and
therefore
harry
annesley
with
his
injuries
had
been
felt
to
be
a
proper
recipient
not
of
the
bounty
but
of
the
results
of
his
hatred
for
his
son
to
run
counter
to
the
law
that
had
ever
been
the
chief
object
of
the
squire
ambition
to
arrange
everything
so
that
it
should
be
seen
that
he
had
set
all
laws
at
defiance
that
had
been
his
great
pride
he
had
done
so
notably
and
with
astonishing
astuteness
in
reference
to
his
wife
and
two
sons
but
now
there
had
come
up
a
condition
of
things
in
which
he
could
again
show
his
cleverness
augustus
had
been
most
anxious
to
get
up
all
the
bonds
which
the
creditors
held
feeling
as
his
father
well
understood
that
he
would
thus
prevent
them
from
making
any
farther
inquiry
when
the
squire
should
have
died
why
should
they
stir
in
the
matter
by
going
to
law
when
there
would
be
nothing
to
be
gained
those
bonds
had
now
been
redeemed
and
were
in
the
possession
of
grey
they
had
been
bought
up
nominally
by
himself
and
must
be
given
to
him
grey
at
any
rate
would
have
the
proof
that
they
had
been
satisfied
they
could
not
be
used
again
to
gratify
any
spite
that
augustus
might
entertain
the
captain
therefore
could
now
enjoy
any
property
which
might
be
left
to
him
of
course
it
would
all
go
to
the
it
might
even
yet
be
better
to
leave
it
to
harry
annesley
but
blood
was
thicker
than
water
though
it
were
but
the
blood
of
a
bastard
he
would
do
a
good
turn
for
harry
in
another
way
all
the
furniture
and
all
the
gems
and
all
the
money
should
again
be
the
future
property
of
mountjoy
but
in
order
that
this
might
be
effected
before
he
died
he
must
not
let
the
grass
grow
under
his
feet
he
thought
of
the
promised
three
months
with
a
possible
extension
to
six
as
suggested
by
sir
william
sir
william
says
three
months
he
said
to
merton
speaking
in
the
easiest
way
of
the
possibility
of
his
living
he
said
six
ah
that
is
if
i
do
what
i
told
but
i
shall
not
exactly
do
that
three
or
six
would
be
all
the
same
only
for
a
little
bit
of
business
i
want
to
get
through
sir
william
orders
would
include
the
abandonment
of
my
business
the
less
done
the
better
then
i
do
not
see
why
sir
william
should
limit
you
to
six
months
i
think
that
three
will
nearly
suffice
a
man
does
not
want
to
die
i
suppose
said
merton
there
are
various
ways
of
looking
at
that
question
replied
the
squire
many
men
desire
the
prolongation
of
life
as
a
lengthened
period
of
enjoyment
there
is
perhaps
something
of
that
feeling
with
me
but
when
you
see
how
far
i
am
crippled
and
curtailed
how
my
enjoyments
are
confined
to
breathing
the
air
to
eating
and
drinking
and
to
the
occasional
reading
of
a
few
pages
you
must
admit
that
there
can
not
be
much
of
that
a
conversation
with
you
is
the
best
of
it
some
want
to
live
for
the
sake
of
their
wives
and
children
in
the
ordinary
acceptation
of
the
words
that
is
all
over
with
me
many
desire
to
live
because
they
fear
to
die
there
is
nothing
of
that
in
me
i
can
assure
you
i
am
not
afraid
to
meet
my
creator
but
there
are
those
who
wish
for
life
that
their
purposes
of
love
or
stronger
purposes
of
hatred
may
be
accomplished
i
am
among
the
number
but
on
that
account
i
only
wish
it
till
those
purposes
have
been
completed
i
think
i
go
to
sleep
for
an
hour
but
there
are
a
couple
of
letters
i
want
you
to
write
before
then
scarborough
turned
himself
round
and
thought
of
the
letters
he
was
to
write
merton
went
out
and
as
he
wandered
about
the
park
in
the
dirt
and
slush
of
december
tried
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
he
most
admired
his
patron
philosophy
or
condemned
his
general
lack
of
principle
at
the
proper
hour
he
appeared
again
and
found
scarborough
quite
alert
i
do
know
whether
i
shall
have
the
three
months
unless
i
behave
better
he
said
i
have
been
thinking
about
those
letters
and
very
nearly
made
an
attempt
to
write
them
there
are
things
about
a
son
which
a
father
does
wish
to
communicate
to
any
one
merton
only
shook
his
head
i
not
a
bit
afraid
of
you
nor
do
i
care
for
your
knowing
what
i
have
to
say
but
there
are
words
which
it
would
be
difficult
even
to
write
and
almost
impossible
to
dictate
but
he
did
make
the
attempt
though
he
did
not
find
himself
able
to
say
all
that
he
had
intended
the
first
letter
was
to
the
lawyer
my
dear
grey
you
will
be
surprised
at
my
writing
to
summon
you
once
again
to
my
bedside
i
think
there
was
some
kind
of
a
promise
made
that
the
request
should
not
be
repeated
but
the
circumstances
are
of
such
a
nature
that
i
do
not
well
know
how
to
avoid
it
however
if
you
refuse
to
come
i
will
give
you
my
instructions
it
is
my
purpose
to
make
another
will
and
to
leave
everything
that
i
am
capable
of
leaving
to
my
son
mountjoy
you
are
aware
that
he
is
now
free
from
debt
and
capable
of
enjoying
any
property
that
he
may
possess
as
circumstances
are
at
present
he
would
on
my
death
be
absolutely
penniless
and
heaven
help
the
man
who
should
find
himself
dependent
on
the
mercy
of
augustus
scarborough
what
i
possess
would
be
the
balance
at
the
bank
the
house
in
town
and
everything
contained
in
and
about
tretton
as
to
which
i
should
wish
that
the
will
should
be
very
explicit
in
making
it
understood
that
every
conceivable
item
of
property
is
to
belong
to
mountjoy
i
know
the
strength
of
an
entail
and
not
for
worlds
would
i
venture
to
meddle
with
anything
so
holy
there
came
a
grin
of
satisfaction
over
his
face
as
he
uttered
these
words
and
his
scribe
was
utterly
unable
to
keep
from
laughing
but
as
augustus
must
have
the
acres
let
him
have
them
bare
underscore
that
word
if
you
please
and
the
word
was
underscored
if
i
had
time
i
would
have
every
tree
about
the
place
cut
down
i
do
think
you
could
under
the
entail
said
merton
i
would
use
up
every
stick
in
building
the
farmers
barns
and
mending
the
farmers
gates
and
i
would
cover
an
acre
just
in
front
of
the
house
with
a
huge
conservatory
i
respect
the
law
my
boy
and
they
would
find
it
difficult
to
prove
that
i
had
gone
beyond
it
but
there
is
no
time
for
that
kind
of
finished
revenge
then
he
went
on
with
the
letter
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
i
wish
to
divide
my
property
so
that
mountjoy
may
have
everything
that
is
not
strictly
entailed
you
will
of
course
say
that
it
will
all
go
to
the
it
may
go
to
the
devil
so
that
augustus
does
not
have
it
but
it
need
not
go
to
the
if
you
would
consent
to
come
down
to
me
once
more
we
might
possibly
devise
some
scheme
for
saving
it
but
whether
we
can
do
so
or
not
it
is
my
request
that
my
last
will
may
be
prepared
in
accordance
with
these
instructions
very
faithfully
yours
john
scarborough
and
now
for
the
other
said
scarborough
had
you
not
better
rest
a
bit
asked
merton
no
this
is
a
kind
of
work
at
which
a
man
does
not
want
to
rest
he
is
carried
on
by
his
own
solicitudes
and
his
own
eagerness
this
will
be
very
short
and
when
it
is
done
then
perhaps
i
may
sleep
the
second
letter
was
as
follows
my
dear
mountjoy
i
think
you
are
foolish
in
allowing
yourself
to
be
prevented
from
coming
here
by
a
sentiment
but
in
truth
independently
of
the
pleasure
i
should
derive
from
your
company
i
wish
you
to
be
here
on
a
matter
of
business
which
is
of
some
importance
to
yourself
i
am
about
to
make
a
new
will
and
although
i
am
bound
to
pay
every
respect
to
the
entail
and
would
not
for
worlds
do
anything
in
opposition
to
the
law
still
i
may
be
enabled
to
do
something
for
your
benefit
your
brother
has
kindly
interfered
for
the
payment
of
your
creditors
and
as
all
the
outstanding
bonds
have
been
redeemed
you
would
now
by
his
generosity
be
enabled
to
enjoy
any
property
which
might
be
left
to
you
there
are
a
few
tables
and
chairs
at
my
disposal
and
a
gem
or
two
and
some
odd
volumes
which
perhaps
you
might
like
to
possess
i
have
written
to
grey
on
the
subject
and
i
would
wish
you
to
see
him
this
you
might
do
whether
you
come
here
or
not
but
i
do
not
the
less
wish
that
you
should
come
your
affectionate
father
john
scarborough
i
think
that
the
odd
volumes
will
fetch
him
he
was
always
fond
of
literature
i
suppose
it
means
the
entire
library
replied
merton
and
he
likes
tables
and
chairs
i
think
he
will
come
and
look
after
the
tables
and
chairs
why
not
beds
and
said
merton
well
yes
he
may
have
the
beds
and
mountjoy
is
not
a
fool
and
will
understand
very
well
what
i
mean
i
wonder
whether
i
could
scrape
the
paper
off
the
walls
and
leave
the
scraps
to
his
brother
without
interfering
with
the
entail
but
now
i
am
tired
and
will
rest
but
he
did
not
even
then
go
to
rest
but
lay
still
scheming
scheming
scheming
about
the
property
there
was
now
another
letter
to
be
written
for
the
writing
of
which
he
would
not
again
summon
merton
he
was
half
ashamed
to
do
so
and
at
last
sent
for
his
sister
martha
said
he
i
want
you
to
write
a
letter
for
me
merton
has
been
writing
letters
for
you
all
the
morning
that
just
the
reason
why
you
should
write
one
now
i
am
still
in
some
slight
degree
afraid
of
his
authority
but
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
of
yours
you
ought
to
be
quiet
john
indeed
you
ought
and
in
order
that
i
may
be
quiet
you
must
write
this
letter
nothing
particular
or
i
should
not
have
asked
you
to
do
it
it
only
an
invitation
an
invitation
to
ask
somebody
here
yes
to
ask
somebody
to
come
here
i
do
know
whether
he
come
do
i
know
him
i
hope
you
may
if
he
comes
he
a
very
young
man
if
that
is
anything
do
talk
nonsense
john
but
i
believe
he
engaged
to
another
young
lady
with
whom
i
must
beg
you
not
to
interfere
you
remember
florence
florence
mountjoy
of
course
i
remember
my
own
niece
the
young
man
is
engaged
to
her
she
was
intended
for
poor
mountjoy
poor
mountjoy
has
put
himself
beyond
all
possibility
of
a
wife
poor
mountjoy
and
the
aunt
almost
shed
tears
but
we
have
to
do
with
mountjoy
now
sit
down
there
and
begin
annesley
oh
it
annesley
is
it
yes
it
is
annesley
is
the
handsome
young
man
have
you
any
objection
only
people
do
say
what
do
they
say
of
course
i
do
know
only
i
have
heard
that
he
is
a
scoundrel
scoundrel
is
very
strong
said
the
old
lady
shocked
a
villain
a
liar
a
thief
and
all
the
rest
of
it
that
what
you
have
heard
and
i
tell
you
who
has
been
your
informant
either
first
or
second
hand
it
has
come
to
you
from
augustus
scarborough
now
we
begin
again
annesley
the
old
lady
paused
a
moment
and
then
setting
herself
firmly
to
the
task
commenced
and
finished
her
letter
as
follows
dear
annesley
you
spent
a
few
days
here
on
one
occasion
and
i
want
to
renew
the
pleasure
which
your
visit
gave
me
will
you
extend
your
kindness
so
far
as
to
come
to
tretton
for
any
time
you
may
please
to
name
beyond
two
or
three
days
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
your
friend
augustus
scarborough
can
not
be
here
to
meet
you
my
other
son
mountjoy
may
be
here
if
you
wish
to
escape
him
i
will
endeavor
so
to
fix
the
time
when
i
shall
have
heard
from
you
but
i
think
there
need
be
no
ill
blood
there
neither
of
you
did
anything
of
which
you
are
probably
ashamed
though
as
an
old
man
i
am
bound
to
express
my
disapproval
surely
he
must
be
ashamed
said
miss
scarborough
never
you
mind
believe
me
you
know
nothing
about
it
then
he
went
on
with
his
letter
but
it
is
not
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
your
society
that
i
ask
you
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
which
may
be
important
yours
faithfully
john
scarborough
chapter
xxxix
how
the
letters
were
received
we
must
now
describe
the
feelings
of
scarborough
correspondents
as
they
received
his
letters
when
grey
begun
to
read
that
which
was
addressed
to
him
he
declared
that
on
no
consideration
would
he
go
down
to
tretton
but
when
he
came
to
inquire
within
himself
as
to
his
objection
he
found
that
it
lay
chiefly
in
his
great
dislike
to
augustus
scarborough
for
poor
mountjoy
as
he
called
him
he
entertained
a
feeling
of
deep
pity
and
pity
we
know
is
akin
to
love
and
for
the
squire
he
in
his
heart
felt
but
little
of
that
profound
dislike
which
he
was
aware
such
conduct
as
the
squire
ought
to
have
generated
he
is
the
greatest
rascal
that
i
ever
knew
he
said
again
and
again
both
to
dolly
and
to
barry
but
yet
he
did
not
regard
him
as
an
honest
man
regards
a
rascal
and
was
angry
with
himself
in
consequence
he
knew
that
there
remained
with
him
even
some
spark
of
love
for
scarborough
which
to
himself
was
inexplicable
from
the
moment
in
which
he
had
first
admitted
the
fact
that
augustus
scarborough
was
the
true
he
had
been
most
determined
in
taking
care
that
that
heirship
should
be
established
it
must
be
known
to
all
men
that
mountjoy
was
not
the
eldest
son
of
his
father
as
the
law
required
him
to
be
for
the
inheritance
of
the
property
and
that
augustus
was
the
eldest
son
but
in
arranging
that
these
truths
should
be
notorious
it
had
come
to
pass
that
he
had
learned
to
hate
augustus
with
an
intensity
that
had
redounded
to
the
advantage
both
of
mountjoy
and
their
father
it
must
be
so
augustus
must
become
augustus
scarborough
esquire
of
tretton
but
the
worse
luck
for
tretton
and
all
connected
with
it
and
grey
did
resolve
that
when
that
day
should
come
all
relation
between
himself
and
tretton
should
cease
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
by
redeeming
the
bonds
mountjoy
would
become
capable
of
owning
and
enjoying
any
property
that
might
be
left
to
him
with
tretton
all
the
belongings
of
tretton
in
the
way
would
of
course
go
to
the
heir
the
belongings
of
tretton
which
were
personal
property
would
in
themselves
amount
to
wealth
for
a
younger
son
that
which
scarborough
would
in
this
way
be
able
to
bequeath
might
probably
be
worth
thirty
thousand
pounds
out
of
the
proceeds
of
the
real
property
the
debts
had
been
paid
and
because
augustus
had
consented
so
to
pay
them
he
was
now
to
be
mulcted
of
those
loose
belongings
which
gave
its
charm
to
tretton
because
augustus
had
paid
mountjoy
debts
mountjoy
was
to
be
enabled
to
rob
augustus
there
was
a
wickedness
in
this
redolent
of
the
old
squire
but
it
was
a
wickedness
in
arranging
which
grey
hesitated
to
participate
as
he
thought
of
it
however
he
could
not
but
feel
what
a
very
clever
man
he
had
for
a
client
it
will
all
go
to
the
of
course
he
said
that
night
to
dolly
it
is
no
affair
of
ours
no
but
when
a
lawyer
is
consulted
he
has
to
think
of
the
prudent
or
imprudent
disposition
of
property
scarborough
has
consulted
you
papa
i
must
look
at
it
as
though
he
had
he
tells
me
what
he
intends
to
do
and
i
am
bound
to
give
him
my
advice
i
can
not
advise
him
to
bestow
all
these
things
on
augustus
whom
i
regard
as
a
long
way
the
worst
of
the
family
you
need
not
care
about
that
and
here
again
continued
grey
comes
up
the
question
what
is
it
that
duty
demands
augustus
is
the
eldest
son
and
is
entitled
to
what
the
law
allots
him
but
mountjoy
was
brought
up
as
the
eldest
son
and
is
certainly
entitled
to
what
provision
the
father
can
make
him
you
can
not
provide
for
such
a
gambler
i
do
know
that
that
comes
within
my
duty
it
is
not
my
fault
that
mountjoy
is
a
gambler
any
more
than
that
it
is
my
fault
that
augustus
is
a
beast
gambler
and
beast
there
they
are
and
moreover
nothing
will
turn
the
squire
from
his
purpose
i
am
only
a
tool
in
his
hands
a
trowel
for
the
laying
of
his
mortar
and
bricks
of
course
i
must
draw
his
will
and
shall
do
it
with
some
pleasure
because
it
will
dispossess
augustus
then
grey
went
to
bed
as
did
also
dolly
but
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
being
summoned
to
his
couch
after
she
had
been
an
hour
in
her
own
bed
i
think
i
shall
go
down
to
tretton
said
grey
you
declared
that
you
would
never
go
there
again
so
i
did
but
i
did
not
know
then
how
much
i
might
come
to
hate
augustus
scarborough
would
you
go
to
tretton
merely
to
injure
him
said
his
daughter
i
have
been
thinking
about
that
said
grey
i
do
know
that
i
would
go
simply
to
do
him
an
injury
but
i
think
that
i
would
go
to
see
that
justice
is
properly
done
that
can
be
arranged
without
your
going
to
tretton
by
putting
our
heads
together
i
think
we
can
contrive
that
the
deed
shall
be
more
effectually
performed
what
we
must
attempt
to
do
is
to
save
this
property
from
going
to
the
there
is
only
one
way
that
occurs
to
me
what
is
that
it
must
be
left
to
his
wife
he
has
a
wife
it
must
be
left
to
some
woman
whom
he
will
consent
to
marry
there
are
three
objects
to
keep
it
from
augustus
to
give
the
enjoyment
of
it
to
mountjoy
and
to
prevent
mountjoy
from
gambling
with
it
the
only
thing
i
can
see
is
a
wife
there
is
a
girl
he
wants
to
marry
said
dolly
but
she
does
want
to
marry
him
and
i
doubt
whether
he
can
be
got
to
marry
any
one
else
there
is
still
a
peck
of
difficulties
oh
papa
i
wish
you
would
wash
your
hands
of
the
scarboroughs
i
must
go
to
tretton
first
said
he
and
now
my
dear
you
are
doing
no
good
by
sitting
up
here
and
talking
to
me
then
with
a
smile
dolly
took
herself
off
to
her
own
chamber
mountjoy
when
he
got
his
letter
was
sitting
over
a
late
breakfast
in
victoria
street
it
was
near
twelve
and
he
was
enjoying
the
delicious
luxury
of
having
his
breakfast
to
eat
with
a
cigar
after
it
and
nothing
else
that
he
need
do
but
the
fruition
of
all
these
comforts
was
somewhat
marred
by
the
knowledge
that
he
had
no
such
dinner
to
expect
he
must
go
out
and
look
for
a
dinner
among
the
the
next
morning
would
bring
him
no
breakfast
and
if
he
were
to
remain
longer
in
victoria
street
he
must
do
so
in
direct
opposition
to
the
owner
of
the
establishment
he
had
that
morning
received
notice
to
quit
and
had
been
told
that
the
following
breakfast
would
be
the
last
meal
served
to
him
let
it
be
good
of
its
kind
mountjoy
had
said
i
believe
you
care
for
nothing
but
eating
and
drinking
there
little
else
that
you
can
do
for
me
and
so
they
had
parted
mountjoy
had
taken
the
precaution
of
having
his
letters
addressed
to
the
house
of
the
friendly
bootmaker
and
now
as
he
was
slowly
pouring
out
his
first
cup
of
coffee
and
thinking
how
nearly
it
must
be
his
last
his
father
letter
was
brought
to
him
the
letter
had
been
delayed
one
day
as
he
himself
had
omitted
to
call
for
it
it
was
necessarily
a
sad
time
for
him
he
was
a
man
who
fought
hard
against
melancholy
taking
it
as
a
primary
rule
of
life
that
for
such
a
one
as
he
had
become
the
pleasures
of
the
immediate
moment
should
suffice
if
one
day
or
better
still
one
night
of
excitement
was
in
store
for
him
the
next
day
should
be
regarded
as
the
unlimited
future
for
which
no
man
can
be
responsible
but
such
philosophy
will
too
frequently
be
insufficient
for
the
stoutest
hearts
mountjoy
heart
would
occasionally
almost
give
way
and
then
his
thoughts
would
be
dreary
enough
hunger
absolute
hunger
without
the
assured
expectation
of
food
had
never
yet
come
upon
him
but
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
its
cravings
if
he
should
find
it
troublesome
to
bear
he
had
already
provided
himself
with
pistol
and
bullets
and
now
with
his
cup
of
coffee
before
him
aromatic
creamy
and
hot
with
a
filleted
sole
rolled
up
before
him
on
a
little
dish
three
or
four
plover
eggs
on
which
to
finish
lying
by
and
on
the
distance
of
the
table
a
chasse
of
brandy
of
which
he
already
well
knew
the
virtues
he
got
his
father
letter
he
did
not
at
first
open
it
disliking
all
thoughts
as
to
his
father
then
gradually
he
tore
the
envelope
and
was
slow
in
understanding
the
full
meaning
of
the
last
lines
he
did
not
at
once
perceive
the
irony
of
his
brother
kindly
interference
and
of
the
generosity
which
had
enabled
him
mountjoy
to
be
a
recipient
of
property
but
his
father
purposed
to
do
something
for
his
benefit
gradually
it
dawned
upon
him
that
his
father
could
only
do
that
something
effectually
because
of
his
brother
dealings
with
the
creditors
then
the
chairs
and
the
tables
and
the
gem
or
two
and
the
odd
volumes
one
by
one
made
themselves
intelligible
that
a
father
should
write
so
to
one
son
and
should
so
write
of
another
was
marvellous
but
then
his
father
was
a
marvellous
man
whose
character
he
was
only
beginning
to
understand
his
father
he
told
himself
had
fortunately
taken
it
into
his
head
to
hate
augustus
and
intended
in
consequence
to
strip
tretton
and
the
property
generally
of
all
their
outside
personal
belongings
yes
he
thought
that
with
such
an
object
before
him
he
would
certainly
go
and
see
grey
and
if
grey
should
so
advise
him
he
would
go
down
to
tretton
on
such
business
as
this
he
would
consent
to
see
his
father
he
did
not
think
that
just
at
present
he
need
have
recourse
to
his
pistol
for
his
devices
he
could
not
on
the
very
day
go
to
tretton
as
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
write
to
his
father
first
his
brother
would
probably
extend
his
hospitality
for
a
couple
of
days
when
he
should
hear
of
the
proposed
journey
and
if
not
would
lend
him
money
for
his
present
purposes
or
under
existing
circumstances
he
might
probably
be
able
to
borrow
it
from
grey
with
a
heart
elevated
to
almost
absolute
bliss
he
ate
his
breakfast
and
drank
his
chasse
and
smoked
his
cigar
and
then
rose
slowly
that
he
might
proceed
to
grey
chambers
but
at
this
moment
augustus
came
in
he
had
only
breakfasted
at
his
own
club
much
less
comfortably
than
he
would
have
done
at
home
in
order
that
he
might
not
sit
at
table
with
his
brother
he
had
now
returned
so
that
he
might
see
to
mountjoy
departure
after
all
augustus
i
am
going
down
to
tretton
said
the
elder
brother
as
he
folded
up
his
father
letter
what
argument
has
the
old
man
used
now
mountjoy
did
not
think
it
well
to
tell
his
brother
the
exact
nature
of
the
arguments
used
and
therefore
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
he
wishes
to
say
something
to
me
about
property
said
mountjoy
then
some
idea
of
the
old
squire
scheme
fell
with
a
crushing
weight
of
anticipated
sorrow
on
augustus
in
a
moment
it
all
occurred
to
him
what
his
father
might
do
what
injuries
he
might
inflict
and
saddest
of
all
feelings
there
came
the
immediate
reflection
that
it
had
all
been
rendered
possible
by
his
own
doings
with
the
conviction
that
so
much
might
be
left
away
from
him
there
came
also
a
farther
feeling
that
after
all
there
was
a
chance
that
his
father
had
invented
the
story
of
his
brother
illegitimacy
that
mountjoy
was
now
free
from
debt
and
that
tretton
with
all
its
belongings
might
now
go
back
to
him
that
his
father
would
do
it
if
it
were
possible
he
did
not
doubt
from
week
to
week
he
had
waited
impatiently
for
his
father
demise
and
had
expected
little
or
none
of
that
mental
activity
which
his
father
had
exercised
what
a
fool
he
had
been
he
said
to
himself
sitting
opposite
to
mountjoy
who
in
the
vacancy
of
the
moment
had
lighted
another
cigar
what
an
ass
had
he
played
his
cards
better
had
he
comforted
and
flattered
and
cosseted
the
old
man
mountjoy
might
have
gone
his
own
way
to
the
dogs
now
at
the
best
tretton
would
come
to
him
stripped
of
everything
and
at
the
worst
no
tretton
would
come
to
him
at
all
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
said
roughly
i
think
i
shall
probably
go
down
and
just
see
the
governor
all
your
feelings
about
your
mother
then
are
blown
to
the
winds
my
feelings
about
your
mother
are
not
blown
to
the
winds
at
all
but
to
speak
of
her
to
you
would
be
wasting
breath
i
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
her
said
augustus
and
i
am
not
aware
that
she
did
me
any
great
kindness
in
bringing
me
into
the
world
do
you
go
to
tretton
this
afternoon
probably
not
or
possibly
said
mountjoy
because
i
shall
find
it
convenient
to
have
your
room
of
course
i
can
not
stir
morning
i
should
at
any
rate
like
to
have
my
breakfast
here
he
paused
for
a
reply
but
none
came
from
his
brother
i
must
have
some
money
to
go
down
to
tretton
with
i
suppose
you
can
lend
it
me
just
for
the
present
not
a
shilling
said
augustus
in
thorough
i
shall
be
able
to
pay
you
very
shortly
not
a
shilling
the
return
i
have
had
from
you
for
all
that
i
have
done
is
not
of
a
nature
to
make
me
do
more
if
i
had
ever
thought
that
you
had
expended
a
sovereign
except
for
the
object
of
furthering
some
plot
of
your
own
i
should
have
been
grateful
as
it
is
i
do
not
know
that
we
owe
very
much
to
each
other
then
he
left
the
room
and
getting
into
a
cab
went
away
to
lincoln
inn
harry
annesley
received
scarborough
letter
down
at
buston
and
was
much
surprised
by
it
he
had
not
spent
the
winter
hitherto
very
pleasantly
his
uncle
he
had
never
seen
though
he
had
heard
from
day
to
day
sundry
stories
of
his
wooing
he
had
soon
given
up
his
hunting
feeling
himself
ashamed
in
his
present
nameless
position
to
ride
joshua
thoroughbung
horses
he
had
taken
to
hard
reading
but
the
hard
reading
had
failed
and
he
had
been
given
up
to
the
miseries
of
his
position
the
hard
reading
had
been
continued
for
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
during
which
he
had
at
any
rate
respected
himself
but
in
an
evil
hour
he
had
allowed
it
to
escape
from
him
and
now
was
again
miserable
then
the
invitation
from
tretton
had
been
received
i
have
got
a
letter
is
from
scarborough
of
tretton
what
does
scarborough
say
he
wants
me
to
go
down
there
do
you
know
scarborough
i
believe
you
have
altogether
quarrelled
with
his
son
oh
yes
i
have
quarrelled
with
augustus
and
have
had
an
encounter
with
mountjoy
not
on
the
most
friendly
terms
but
the
father
and
mountjoy
seem
to
be
reconciled
you
can
see
his
letter
i
at
any
rate
shall
go
there
to
this
annesley
senior
had
no
objection
to
make
chapter
xl
visitors
at
tretton
it
so
happened
that
the
three
visitors
who
had
been
asked
to
tretton
all
agreed
to
go
on
the
same
day
there
was
indeed
no
reason
why
harry
should
delay
his
visit
and
much
why
the
other
two
should
expedite
theirs
grey
knew
that
the
thing
if
done
at
all
should
be
done
at
once
and
mountjoy
as
he
had
agreed
to
accept
his
father
offer
could
not
put
himself
too
quickly
under
the
shelter
of
his
father
roof
you
can
have
twenty
pounds
grey
had
said
when
the
subject
of
the
money
was
mooted
will
that
suffice
mountjoy
had
said
that
it
would
suffice
amply
and
then
returning
to
his
brother
rooms
had
waited
there
with
what
patience
he
possessed
till
he
sallied
forth
to
the
continental
to
get
the
best
dinner
which
that
restaurant
could
afford
him
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
his
life
was
very
sad
in
london
and
to
look
forward
to
the
glades
of
tretton
with
some
anticipation
of
rural
delight
he
went
down
by
the
same
train
with
grey
a
great
grind
as
mountjoy
called
it
when
grey
proposed
a
departure
at
ten
harry
followed
so
as
to
reach
tretton
only
in
time
for
dinner
if
i
may
venture
to
advise
you
said
grey
in
the
train
i
should
do
in
this
matter
whatever
my
father
asked
me
hereupon
mountjoy
frowned
he
is
anxious
to
make
some
provision
for
you
i
not
grateful
to
my
father
if
you
mean
that
it
is
hard
to
say
whether
you
should
be
grateful
but
from
the
first
he
has
done
the
best
he
could
for
you
according
to
his
lights
you
believe
all
this
about
my
mother
i
do
i
do
that
the
difference
and
i
do
think
that
augustus
believes
it
the
story
is
undoubtedly
true
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
will
not
accept
it
at
any
rate
you
had
parted
with
your
share
in
the
property
my
share
was
the
whole
after
your
father
death
said
grey
and
that
was
gone
we
need
discuss
the
property
what
is
it
that
he
expects
me
to
do
now
simply
to
be
kind
in
your
manner
to
him
and
to
agree
to
what
he
says
about
the
personal
property
it
is
his
intention
as
far
as
i
understand
it
to
leave
you
everything
he
is
very
kind
i
think
he
is
only
it
would
all
have
been
mine
if
he
had
not
cheated
me
of
my
birthright
or
tyrrwhit
and
hart
and
mr
spicer
tyrrwhit
and
hart
and
spicer
could
not
have
robbed
me
of
my
name
let
them
have
done
what
they
would
with
their
bonds
i
should
have
been
at
any
rate
scarborough
of
tretton
my
belief
is
that
i
need
not
blush
for
my
mother
he
has
made
it
appear
that
i
should
do
so
i
ca
forgive
him
because
he
gives
me
the
chairs
and
tables
they
will
be
worth
thirty
thousand
pounds
said
grey
i
ca
forgive
him
the
cloud
sat
very
black
upon
mountjoy
scarborough
face
as
he
said
this
and
the
blacker
it
sat
the
more
grey
liked
him
if
something
could
be
done
to
redeem
from
ruin
a
young
man
who
so
felt
about
his
mother
who
so
felt
about
his
mother
simply
because
she
had
been
his
mother
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
do
augustus
had
entertained
no
such
feeling
he
had
said
to
grey
as
he
had
said
also
to
his
brother
that
he
had
not
known
the
lady
when
the
facts
as
to
the
distribution
of
the
property
had
been
made
known
to
him
he
had
cared
nothing
for
the
injury
done
by
the
story
to
his
mother
name
the
story
was
too
true
grey
knew
that
it
was
true
but
he
could
not
on
that
account
do
other
than
feel
an
intense
desire
to
confer
some
benefit
on
mountjoy
scarborough
he
put
his
hand
out
affectionately
and
laid
it
on
the
other
man
knee
your
father
has
not
long
to
live
captain
scarborough
i
suppose
not
and
he
is
at
present
anxious
to
make
what
reparation
is
in
his
power
what
he
can
leave
you
will
produce
let
us
say
fifteen
hundred
a
year
without
a
will
from
him
you
would
have
to
live
on
your
bounty
by
heaven
no
said
mountjoy
thinking
of
the
pistol
and
the
bullets
i
see
nothing
else
i
see
but
i
can
not
explain
do
you
not
think
that
fifteen
hundred
a
year
would
be
better
than
nothing
with
a
wife
let
us
say
said
grey
beginning
to
introduce
the
one
argument
on
which
he
believed
so
much
must
depend
with
a
wife
yes
with
a
wife
with
what
wife
a
wife
may
be
very
well
but
a
wife
must
depend
on
who
it
is
is
there
any
one
that
you
mean
not
exactly
any
particular
person
said
the
lawyer
lamely
pshaw
what
do
i
want
with
a
wife
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
father
has
told
you
that
he
intends
to
clog
his
legacy
with
the
burden
of
a
wife
i
would
not
accept
it
with
such
a
burden
unless
i
could
choose
the
wife
myself
to
tell
the
truth
there
is
a
girl
your
cousin
yes
my
cousin
when
i
was
in
the
world
i
was
taught
to
believe
that
i
could
have
her
if
she
will
be
mine
grey
i
will
renounce
gambling
altogether
if
my
father
can
manage
that
i
will
forgive
him
or
will
endeavor
to
do
so
the
property
which
he
can
leave
me
shall
be
settled
altogether
upon
her
i
will
endeavor
to
reform
myself
and
so
to
live
that
no
misfortune
shall
come
upon
her
if
that
is
what
you
mean
say
so
well
not
quite
that
to
no
other
marriage
will
i
agree
that
has
been
the
dream
of
my
life
through
all
those
moments
of
hot
excitement
and
assured
despair
which
i
have
endured
her
mother
has
always
told
me
that
it
should
be
so
and
she
herself
in
former
days
did
not
deny
it
now
you
know
it
all
if
my
father
wishes
to
see
me
married
florence
mountjoy
must
be
my
wife
then
he
sunk
back
on
his
seat
and
nothing
more
was
said
between
them
till
they
had
reached
tretton
the
father
and
son
had
not
met
each
other
since
the
day
on
which
the
former
had
told
the
latter
the
story
of
his
birth
since
then
mountjoy
had
disappeared
from
the
world
and
for
a
few
days
his
father
had
thought
that
he
had
been
murdered
but
now
they
met
as
they
might
have
done
had
they
seen
each
other
a
week
ago
well
mountjoy
how
are
you
and
how
are
you
sir
such
were
the
greetings
between
them
and
no
others
were
spoken
in
a
few
minutes
the
son
was
allowed
to
go
and
look
after
the
rural
joys
he
had
anticipated
and
the
lawyer
was
left
closeted
with
the
squire
grey
soon
explained
his
proposition
let
the
property
be
left
to
trustees
who
should
realize
from
it
what
money
it
should
fetch
and
keep
the
money
in
their
own
hands
paying
mountjoy
the
income
there
could
he
said
be
nothing
better
done
unless
mountjoy
would
agree
to
marry
he
is
attached
it
seems
to
his
cousin
said
grey
and
he
is
unwilling
at
present
to
marry
any
one
else
he
ca
marry
her
said
the
squire
i
do
not
know
the
circumstances
he
ca
marry
her
she
is
engaged
to
the
young
man
who
will
be
here
just
now
i
told
you
did
i
not
that
harry
annesley
is
coming
here
my
son
knows
that
he
will
be
here
everybody
knows
the
story
of
annesley
and
the
captain
they
are
to
sit
down
to
dinner
together
and
i
trust
they
may
not
quarrel
the
lady
of
whom
you
are
speaking
is
engaged
to
young
annesley
and
mountjoy
suit
in
that
direction
is
hopeless
hopeless
you
think
utterly
hopeless
your
plan
of
providing
him
with
a
wife
would
be
very
good
if
it
were
feasible
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
settled
but
if
he
will
marry
no
one
but
florence
mountjoy
he
must
remain
unmarried
augustus
has
had
his
hand
in
that
business
and
do
let
us
dabble
in
it
then
the
squire
gave
the
lawyer
full
instructions
as
to
the
will
which
was
to
be
made
grey
and
bullfist
were
to
be
named
as
trustees
with
instructions
to
sell
everything
which
it
would
be
in
the
squire
legal
power
to
bequeath
the
books
the
gems
the
furniture
both
at
tretton
and
in
london
the
plate
the
stock
the
the
pictures
on
the
walls
and
the
wine
in
the
cellars
were
all
named
he
endeavored
to
persuade
grey
to
consent
to
a
cutting
of
the
timber
so
that
the
value
of
it
might
be
taken
out
of
the
pocket
of
the
younger
brother
and
put
into
that
of
the
elder
but
to
this
grey
would
not
assent
there
would
be
an
air
of
persecution
about
it
he
said
and
it
must
be
done
but
to
the
general
stripping
of
tretton
for
the
benefit
of
mountjoy
he
gave
a
cordial
agreement
i
am
not
quite
sure
that
i
have
done
with
augustus
as
yet
said
the
squire
i
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
be
put
out
by
trifles
not
to
be
vexed
at
a
little
my
treatment
of
my
children
has
been
such
that
though
i
have
ever
intended
to
do
them
good
i
must
have
seemed
to
each
at
different
periods
to
have
injured
him
i
have
not
therefore
expected
much
from
them
but
i
have
received
less
than
nothing
from
augustus
it
is
possible
that
he
may
hear
from
me
again
to
this
grey
said
nothing
but
he
had
taken
his
instructions
about
the
drawing
of
the
will
harry
came
down
by
the
train
in
time
for
dinner
on
the
journey
down
he
had
been
perplexed
in
his
mind
thinking
of
various
things
he
did
not
quite
understand
why
scarborough
had
sent
for
him
his
former
intimacy
had
been
with
augustus
and
though
there
had
been
some
cordiality
of
friendship
shown
by
the
old
man
to
the
son
companion
it
had
amounted
to
no
more
than
might
be
expected
from
one
who
was
notably
a
great
injury
had
been
done
to
harry
and
he
supposed
that
his
visit
must
have
some
reference
to
that
injury
he
had
been
told
in
so
many
words
that
come
when
he
might
he
would
not
find
augustus
at
tretton
from
this
and
from
other
signs
he
almost
saw
that
there
existed
a
quarrel
between
the
squire
and
his
son
therefore
he
felt
that
something
was
to
be
said
as
to
the
state
of
his
affairs
at
buston
but
if
as
the
train
drew
near
to
tretton
he
was
anxious
as
to
his
meeting
with
the
squire
he
was
much
more
so
as
to
the
captain
the
reader
will
remember
all
the
circumstances
under
which
they
two
had
last
seen
each
other
harry
had
been
furiously
attacked
by
mountjoy
and
had
then
left
him
sprawling
dead
as
some
folks
had
said
on
the
following
day
under
the
rail
his
only
crime
had
been
that
he
was
drunk
if
the
disinherited
one
would
give
him
his
hand
and
let
be
he
would
do
the
same
he
felt
no
personal
animosity
but
there
was
a
difficulty
as
he
was
driven
up
to
the
door
in
a
cab
belonging
to
the
squire
there
was
mountjoy
standing
before
the
house
he
too
had
thought
of
the
difficulties
and
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
meet
his
late
foe
without
some
few
words
intended
for
the
making
of
peace
i
hope
you
are
well
annesley
he
said
offering
his
hand
as
the
other
got
out
of
the
cab
it
may
be
as
well
that
i
should
apologize
at
once
for
my
conduct
i
was
at
that
moment
considerably
distressed
as
you
may
have
heard
i
had
been
declared
to
be
penniless
and
to
be
nobody
the
news
had
a
little
unmanned
me
and
i
was
beside
myself
i
quite
understand
it
quite
understand
it
said
annesley
giving
his
hand
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
back
again
and
in
your
house
then
mountjoy
turned
on
his
heel
and
went
through
the
hall
leaving
harry
to
the
care
of
the
butler
the
captain
thought
that
he
had
done
enough
and
that
the
affair
in
the
street
might
now
be
regarded
as
a
dream
harry
was
taken
up
to
shake
hands
with
the
old
man
and
in
due
time
came
down
to
dinner
where
he
met
grey
and
the
young
doctor
they
were
all
very
civil
to
him
and
upon
the
whole
he
spent
a
pleasant
evening
on
the
next
day
about
noon
the
squire
sent
for
him
he
had
been
told
at
breakfast
that
it
was
the
squire
intention
to
see
him
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
he
had
been
unable
therefore
to
join
mountjoy
sit
down
annesley
said
the
old
man
you
were
surprised
no
doubt
when
you
got
my
invitation
well
yes
perhaps
so
but
i
thought
it
very
kind
i
meant
to
be
kind
but
still
it
requires
some
explanation
you
see
i
am
such
an
old
cripple
that
i
can
not
give
invitations
like
anybody
else
now
you
are
here
i
must
not
eat
and
drink
with
you
and
in
order
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
i
am
obliged
to
keep
you
in
the
house
till
the
doctor
tells
me
i
am
strong
enough
to
talk
i
am
glad
to
find
you
so
much
better
than
when
i
was
here
before
i
do
know
much
about
that
there
will
never
be
a
better
in
my
case
the
people
about
me
talk
with
the
utmost
unconcern
of
whether
i
can
live
one
month
or
possibly
two
anything
beyond
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
the
squire
took
a
pride
in
making
the
worst
of
his
case
so
that
the
people
to
whom
he
talked
should
marvel
the
more
at
his
vitality
but
we
wo
mind
my
health
now
it
is
true
i
fear
that
you
have
quarrelled
with
your
uncle
it
is
quite
true
that
he
has
quarrelled
with
me
i
am
afraid
that
that
is
more
important
he
means
if
he
can
to
cut
you
out
of
the
entail
he
does
not
mean
that
i
shall
have
the
property
if
he
can
prevent
it
i
do
think
very
much
of
entails
myself
said
the
squire
if
a
man
has
a
property
he
should
be
able
to
leave
it
as
he
pleases
or
or
else
he
does
have
it
that
is
what
the
law
intends
i
suppose
said
harry
just
so
but
the
law
is
such
an
old
woman
that
she
never
knows
how
to
express
herself
to
any
purpose
i
have
allowed
the
law
to
bind
me
i
dare
say
you
know
the
story
about
your
two
sons
and
the
property
i
think
all
the
world
knows
the
story
i
suppose
it
has
been
talked
about
a
little
said
the
squire
with
a
chuckle
my
object
has
been
to
prevent
the
law
from
handing
over
my
property
to
the
fraudulent
claims
which
my
son
creditors
were
enabled
to
make
and
i
have
succeeded
fairly
well
on
that
head
i
have
nothing
to
regret
now
your
uncle
is
going
to
take
other
means
yes
he
is
going
to
take
means
which
are
at
any
rate
lawful
but
which
will
be
tedious
and
may
not
perhaps
succeed
he
is
intending
to
have
an
heir
of
his
own
that
i
believe
is
his
purpose
said
harry
there
is
no
reason
why
he
should
but
he
may
you
know
he
is
not
married
yet
no
he
is
not
married
yet
and
then
he
has
also
stopped
the
allowance
he
used
to
make
you
harry
nodded
assent
now
all
this
is
a
great
shame
i
think
so
the
poor
gentleman
has
been
awfully
bamboozled
he
is
not
so
very
old
said
harry
i
do
think
he
is
more
than
fifty
but
he
is
an
old
goose
you
excuse
me
i
know
augustus
scarborough
got
him
up
to
london
and
filled
him
full
of
lies
i
am
aware
of
it
and
so
am
i
aware
of
it
he
has
told
him
stories
as
to
your
conduct
with
mountjoy
which
added
to
some
youthful
indiscretions
of
your
own
it
was
simply
because
i
did
like
to
hear
him
read
sermons
that
was
an
indiscretion
as
he
had
the
power
in
his
hands
to
do
you
an
injury
most
men
have
got
some
little
bit
of
petty
tyranny
in
their
hearts
i
have
had
none
to
this
harry
could
only
bow
i
let
my
two
boys
do
as
they
pleased
only
wishing
that
they
should
lead
happy
lives
i
never
made
them
listen
to
sermons
or
even
to
lectures
probably
i
was
wrong
had
i
tyrannized
over
them
they
would
not
have
tyrannized
over
me
as
they
have
done
now
i
tell
you
what
it
is
that
i
propose
to
do
i
will
write
to
your
uncle
or
will
get
merton
to
write
for
me
and
will
explain
to
him
as
well
as
i
can
the
depth
and
the
blackness
and
the
cruelty
the
unfathomable
heathen
cruelty
together
with
the
falsehoods
the
premeditated
lies
and
the
general
rascality
on
all
subjects
of
my
son
augustus
i
will
explain
to
him
that
of
all
men
i
know
he
is
the
least
trustworthy
i
will
explain
to
him
that
if
led
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
by
augustus
scarborough
he
will
be
surely
led
astray
and
i
think
that
between
us
between
merton
and
me
that
is
we
can
concoct
a
letter
that
shall
be
efficacious
but
i
will
get
mountjoy
also
to
go
and
see
him
and
explain
to
him
out
of
his
own
mouth
what
in
truth
occurred
that
night
when
he
and
you
fell
out
in
the
streets
prosper
must
be
a
more
vindictive
man
than
i
take
him
to
be
in
regard
to
sermons
if
he
will
hold
out
after
that
then
scarborough
allowed
him
to
go
out
and
if
possible
find
the
shooters
somewhere
about
the
park
chapter
xli
mountjoy
scarborough
goes
to
buston
grey
returned
to
london
after
staying
but
one
night
having
received
fresh
instructions
as
to
the
will
the
will
was
to
be
prepared
at
once
and
barry
was
to
bring
it
down
for
execution
shall
i
not
inform
augustus
asked
grey
but
this
did
not
suit
with
scarborough
views
of
revenge
i
think
not
i
would
do
by
him
whatever
honesty
requires
but
i
have
never
told
him
that
i
mean
to
leave
him
anything
of
course
he
knows
that
he
is
to
have
the
estate
he
is
revelling
in
the
future
poverty
of
poor
mountjoy
he
turned
him
out
of
his
house
just
now
because
mountjoy
would
not
obey
him
by
going
to
brazil
he
would
turn
him
out
of
this
house
if
he
could
because
i
wo
at
once
go
to
the
devil
he
is
something
overmasterful
is
master
augustus
and
a
rub
or
two
will
do
him
good
i
rather
you
would
tell
him
if
you
please
then
grey
departed
without
making
any
promise
but
he
determined
that
he
would
be
guided
by
the
squire
wishes
augustus
scarborough
was
not
of
a
nature
to
excite
very
warmly
the
charity
of
any
man
harry
remained
for
two
or
three
days
shooting
with
mountjoy
and
once
or
twice
he
saw
the
squire
again
merton
and
i
have
managed
to
concoct
that
letter
said
the
squire
i
afraid
your
uncle
will
find
it
rather
long
is
he
impatient
of
long
letters
he
likes
long
sermons
if
anybody
will
listen
to
his
reading
i
think
you
have
a
deal
to
answer
for
yourself
when
you
could
not
make
so
small
a
sacrifice
to
the
man
to
whom
you
were
to
owe
everything
but
he
ought
to
look
for
a
wife
in
consequence
of
that
crime
and
not
falsely
allege
another
if
as
i
fear
he
finds
the
troublesome
our
letter
may
perhaps
move
him
and
mountjoy
is
to
go
down
and
open
his
eyes
mountjoy
has
made
any
difficulty
about
it
i
shall
be
greatly
distressed
harry
begun
not
at
all
he
must
go
i
like
to
have
my
own
way
in
these
little
matters
he
owes
you
as
much
reparation
as
that
and
we
shall
be
able
to
see
what
members
of
the
scarborough
family
you
would
trust
the
most
harry
during
the
two
days
shot
some
hares
in
company
with
mountjoy
but
not
a
word
more
was
said
about
the
adventure
in
london
nor
was
the
name
of
florence
mountjoy
ever
mentioned
between
the
two
suitors
going
to
buston
you
know
mountjoy
said
once
so
your
father
told
me
what
sort
of
a
fellow
shall
i
find
your
uncle
he
a
gentleman
but
not
very
wise
no
more
was
said
between
them
on
that
head
but
mountjoy
spoke
at
great
length
about
his
own
brother
and
his
father
will
my
father
is
the
most
singular
man
you
ever
came
across
i
think
he
is
i
am
not
going
to
say
a
good
word
for
him
i
would
let
him
think
that
i
had
said
a
good
word
for
him
in
order
to
save
the
property
he
has
maligned
my
mother
and
has
cheated
me
and
the
creditors
most
horribly
most
infernally
that
my
conviction
though
grey
thinks
otherwise
i
ca
forgive
him
and
wo
and
he
knows
it
but
after
that
he
is
going
to
do
the
best
thing
he
can
for
me
and
he
has
begun
by
making
me
a
decent
allowance
again
as
his
son
but
i
to
have
that
only
as
long
as
i
remain
here
at
tretton
of
course
i
have
been
fond
of
cards
i
suppose
so
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
i
have
touched
a
card
now
for
a
month
nearly
and
then
he
is
going
to
leave
me
what
property
he
has
to
leave
and
he
and
my
brother
have
paid
off
those
jews
among
them
i
not
a
bit
obliged
to
my
brother
he
got
some
game
of
his
own
which
i
do
quite
clearly
see
and
my
father
is
doing
this
for
me
simply
to
spite
my
brother
he
cut
down
every
tree
upon
the
place
if
grey
would
allow
it
and
yet
to
give
augustus
the
property
my
father
has
done
this
gross
injustice
i
suppose
the
would
have
had
the
best
of
it
had
he
not
that
true
they
would
have
had
it
all
they
had
measured
every
yard
of
it
and
had
got
my
name
down
for
the
full
value
now
they
paid
that
a
comfort
nothing
a
comfort
i
know
that
they
right
and
that
if
i
got
the
money
into
my
own
hand
it
would
be
gone
i
should
be
off
to
monte
carlo
like
a
shot
and
of
course
it
would
go
after
the
other
there
is
but
one
thing
would
redeem
me
what
that
never
mind
we
wo
talk
of
it
then
he
was
silent
but
harry
annesley
knew
very
well
that
he
had
alluded
to
florence
mountjoy
then
harry
went
and
mountjoy
was
left
to
the
companionship
of
merton
and
such
pleasure
as
he
could
find
in
a
daily
visit
to
his
father
he
was
at
any
rate
courteous
in
his
manner
to
the
old
man
and
abstained
from
those
irritating
speeches
which
augustus
had
always
chosen
to
make
he
had
on
one
occasion
during
this
visit
told
his
father
what
he
thought
about
him
but
this
the
squire
had
taken
quite
as
a
compliment
i
believe
you
know
that
you
done
a
monstrous
injustice
to
everybody
concerned
i
rather
like
doing
what
you
call
injustices
you
have
set
the
law
at
defiance
well
yes
i
think
i
have
done
that
according
to
my
belief
it
all
untrue
you
mean
about
your
mother
i
like
you
for
that
i
do
indeed
i
like
you
for
sticking
up
for
your
poor
mother
well
now
you
shall
have
fifty
pounds
a
month
say
twelve
pounds
ten
a
week
as
long
as
you
remain
at
tretton
and
you
may
have
whom
you
like
here
as
long
as
they
bring
no
cards
with
them
and
if
you
want
to
hunt
there
are
horses
and
if
they
ai
good
enough
you
can
get
others
but
if
you
go
away
from
tretton
there
an
end
of
it
it
will
all
be
stopped
the
next
day
nevertheless
he
did
make
arrangements
by
which
mountjoy
should
proceed
to
buston
stopping
two
nights
as
he
went
to
london
there
is
a
club
he
can
enter
said
the
squire
comforting
himself
nor
a
jew
that
will
lend
him
a
note
mountjoy
had
told
the
truth
when
he
had
said
that
nothing
was
a
comfort
though
it
seemed
to
his
father
and
to
the
people
around
him
at
tretton
that
he
had
everything
that
a
man
could
want
he
had
in
fact
nothing
nothing
to
satisfy
him
in
the
first
place
he
was
quite
alive
to
the
misery
of
that
decision
given
by
the
world
against
him
which
had
been
of
such
comfort
to
his
father
not
a
club
in
london
would
admit
him
he
had
been
proclaimed
a
defaulter
after
such
a
fashion
that
all
his
clubs
had
sent
to
him
for
some
explanation
and
as
he
had
given
none
and
had
not
answered
their
letters
his
name
had
been
crossed
out
in
the
books
of
them
all
he
knew
himself
to
be
a
man
disgraced
and
when
he
had
fled
from
london
he
had
gone
under
the
conviction
that
he
would
certainly
never
return
there
were
the
pistol
and
bullet
as
his
last
assured
resource
but
a
certain
amount
of
had
awaited
him
enough
to
save
him
from
having
recourse
to
their
aid
his
brother
had
supplied
him
with
small
sums
of
money
and
from
time
to
time
a
morsel
of
good
luck
had
enabled
him
to
gamble
not
to
his
content
but
still
in
some
manner
so
as
to
make
his
life
bearable
but
now
he
was
back
in
his
own
country
and
he
could
gamble
not
at
all
and
hardly
even
see
those
old
companions
with
whom
he
had
lived
it
was
not
only
for
the
that
he
sighed
but
for
the
companions
of
the
and
though
he
knew
that
he
had
been
scratched
out
from
the
lists
of
all
clubs
as
a
dishonest
man
he
knew
also
or
thought
that
he
knew
that
he
had
been
as
honest
as
the
best
of
those
companions
as
long
as
he
could
by
any
possibility
raise
money
he
had
paid
it
away
and
by
no
false
trick
had
he
ever
endeavored
to
get
it
back
again
had
a
little
time
been
allowed
him
all
would
have
been
paid
and
all
had
been
paid
he
knew
that
by
the
rules
of
such
institutions
time
could
not
be
granted
but
still
he
did
not
feel
himself
to
have
been
a
dishonest
man
yet
he
had
been
so
disgraced
that
he
could
hardly
venture
to
walk
about
the
streets
of
london
in
the
daylight
and
then
there
came
upon
him
when
he
found
himself
alone
at
tretton
an
irrepressible
desire
for
gambling
it
was
as
though
his
throat
were
parched
with
an
implacable
thirst
he
walked
about
ever
meditating
certain
fortunate
turns
of
the
cards
and
when
he
had
worked
himself
up
to
some
realization
of
his
old
excitement
he
would
remember
that
it
was
all
a
vain
and
empty
bubble
he
had
money
in
his
pocket
and
could
rush
up
to
london
if
he
would
and
if
he
did
so
he
could
no
doubt
find
some
coarse
hell
at
which
he
could
stake
it
till
it
would
be
all
gone
but
the
gates
of
the
a
and
the
b
and
the
c
would
be
closed
against
him
and
he
would
then
be
driven
to
feel
that
he
had
indeed
fallen
into
the
nethermost
pit
were
he
once
to
play
at
such
places
as
his
mind
painted
to
him
he
could
never
play
at
any
other
and
yet
when
the
day
drew
nigh
on
which
he
was
to
go
to
london
on
his
way
to
buston
he
did
bethink
himself
where
these
places
were
to
be
found
his
throat
was
parched
and
the
thirst
upon
him
was
extreme
cards
were
the
weapons
he
had
used
he
had
played
ecarte
piquet
whist
and
baccarat
with
an
occasional
night
of
some
foolish
game
such
as
cribbage
or
though
he
had
always
lost
he
had
always
played
with
men
who
had
played
honestly
there
is
much
that
is
in
truth
dishonest
even
in
honest
play
a
man
who
can
keep
himself
sober
after
dinner
plays
with
one
who
flusters
himself
with
drink
the
man
with
a
trained
memory
plays
with
him
who
can
not
remember
a
card
the
cool
man
plays
with
the
impetuous
the
man
who
can
hold
his
tongue
with
him
who
can
not
but
talk
the
man
whose
practised
face
will
tell
no
secrets
with
him
who
loses
a
point
every
rubber
by
his
uncontrolled
grimaces
and
then
there
is
the
man
who
knows
the
game
and
plays
with
him
who
knows
it
not
at
all
of
course
the
cool
the
collected
the
thoughtful
the
practised
they
who
have
given
up
their
whole
souls
to
the
study
of
cards
will
play
at
a
great
advantage
which
in
their
calculations
they
do
not
fail
to
recognize
see
the
man
standing
by
and
watching
the
table
and
leaving
all
the
bets
he
can
on
a
and
b
as
against
c
and
d
and
however
ignorant
you
may
be
you
will
soon
become
sure
that
a
and
b
know
the
game
whereas
c
and
d
are
simply
infants
that
is
all
fair
and
acknowledged
but
looking
at
it
from
a
distance
as
you
lie
under
your
in
your
orchard
far
from
the
shout
of
two
by
honors
you
will
come
to
doubt
the
honesty
of
making
your
income
after
such
a
fashion
such
as
it
is
mountjoy
sighed
for
it
bitterly
sighed
for
it
but
could
not
see
where
it
was
to
be
found
he
had
a
gentleman
horror
of
those
resorts
in
or
kept
by
the
disciples
of
where
he
would
surely
be
robbed
which
did
not
appal
him
but
robbed
in
bad
company
thinking
of
all
this
he
went
up
to
london
late
in
the
afternoon
and
spent
an
uncomfortable
evening
in
town
it
was
absolutely
innocent
as
regarded
the
doings
of
the
night
itself
but
was
terrible
to
him
there
was
a
slow
drizzling
rain
but
not
the
less
after
dinner
at
his
hotel
he
started
off
to
wander
through
the
streets
with
his
and
his
umbrella
he
was
almost
hidden
and
as
he
passed
through
pall
mall
up
james
street
and
along
piccadilly
he
could
pause
and
look
in
at
the
accustomed
door
he
saw
men
entering
whom
he
knew
and
knew
that
within
five
minutes
they
could
be
seated
at
their
tables
i
had
an
awfully
heavy
time
of
it
last
night
one
said
to
another
as
he
went
up
the
steps
and
mountjoy
as
he
heard
the
words
envied
the
speaker
then
he
passed
back
and
went
again
a
tour
of
all
the
clubs
what
had
he
done
that
he
like
a
poor
peri
should
be
unable
to
enter
the
gates
of
all
these
paradises
he
had
now
in
his
pocket
fifty
pounds
could
he
have
been
made
absolutely
certain
that
he
would
have
lost
it
he
would
have
gone
into
any
paradise
and
have
staked
his
money
with
that
certainty
at
last
having
turned
up
waterloo
place
he
saw
a
man
standing
in
the
of
one
of
these
palaces
and
he
was
aware
at
once
that
the
man
had
seen
him
he
was
a
man
of
such
a
nature
that
it
would
be
impossible
that
he
should
have
seen
a
worse
he
was
a
small
dry
little
fellow
with
a
carefully
preserved
mustache
and
a
head
from
the
top
of
which
age
was
beginning
to
move
the
hair
he
lived
by
cards
and
lived
well
he
was
called
captain
vignolles
but
it
was
only
known
of
him
that
he
was
a
professional
gambler
he
probably
never
cheated
men
who
play
at
the
clubs
scarcely
ever
cheat
there
are
so
many
with
whom
they
play
sharp
enough
to
discover
them
and
with
the
discovered
gambler
all
in
this
world
is
over
captain
vignolles
never
cheated
but
he
found
that
an
obedience
to
those
little
rules
which
i
have
named
above
stood
him
well
in
lieu
of
cheating
he
was
not
known
to
have
any
particular
income
but
he
was
known
to
live
on
the
best
of
everything
as
far
as
club
life
was
concerned
he
immediately
followed
mountjoy
down
into
the
street
and
greeted
him
captain
scarborough
as
i
am
a
living
man
well
vignolles
how
are
you
and
so
you
have
come
back
once
more
to
the
land
of
the
living
i
was
awfully
sorry
for
you
and
think
that
they
treated
you
uncommon
harshly
as
you
paid
your
money
of
course
they
let
you
in
again
in
answer
to
this
mountjoy
had
very
little
to
say
but
the
interview
ended
by
his
accepting
an
invitation
from
captain
vignolles
to
supper
for
the
following
evening
if
captain
scarborough
would
come
at
eleven
captain
vignolles
would
ask
a
few
fellows
to
meet
him
and
they
would
have
just
a
little
rubber
of
whist
mountjoy
knew
well
the
nature
of
the
man
who
asked
him
and
understood
perfectly
what
would
be
the
result
but
there
thrilled
through
his
bosom
as
he
accepted
the
invitation
a
sense
of
joy
which
he
could
himself
hardly
understand
on
the
following
morning
mountjoy
was
up
for
him
very
early
and
taking
a
return
ticket
went
down
to
buston
he
had
written
to
prosper
sending
his
compliments
and
saying
that
he
would
do
himself
the
honor
of
calling
at
a
certain
hour
at
the
hour
named
he
drew
up
at
buston
hall
in
a
fly
from
buntingford
station
and
was
told
by
matthew
the
old
butler
that
his
master
was
at
home
if
captain
mountjoy
would
step
into
the
prosper
should
be
informed
mountjoy
did
as
he
was
bidden
and
after
half
an
hour
he
was
joined
by
prosper
you
have
received
a
letter
from
my
father
he
began
by
saying
a
very
long
letter
said
the
squire
of
buston
i
dare
say
i
did
not
see
it
and
have
in
fact
very
little
to
say
as
to
its
contents
i
do
not
know
indeed
what
they
were
the
letter
refers
to
my
nephew
henry
annesley
i
suppose
so
what
i
have
to
say
refers
to
henry
annesley
also
you
are
kind
very
kind
i
do
know
about
that
but
i
have
come
altogether
at
my
instance
and
i
think
indeed
that
in
fairness
i
ought
to
tell
you
the
truth
as
to
what
took
place
between
me
and
your
nephew
you
are
very
good
but
your
father
has
already
given
me
his
account
and
i
suppose
yours
i
do
know
what
my
father
may
have
done
but
i
think
that
you
ought
to
desire
to
hear
from
my
lips
an
account
of
the
transaction
an
untrue
account
has
been
told
to
you
i
have
heard
it
all
from
your
own
brother
an
untrue
account
has
been
told
to
you
i
attacked
your
nephew
what
made
you
do
that
asked
the
squire
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
but
i
did
i
understood
all
that
before
but
you
did
understand
that
annesley
behaved
perfectly
well
in
all
that
occurred
did
he
tell
a
lie
about
it
afterward
my
brother
no
doubt
lured
him
on
to
make
an
untrue
statement
a
lie
you
may
call
it
so
if
you
will
if
you
think
that
augustus
was
to
have
it
all
his
own
way
i
disagree
with
you
altogether
in
point
of
fact
your
nephew
behaved
through
the
whole
of
that
matter
as
well
as
a
man
could
do
practically
he
told
no
lie
at
all
he
did
just
what
a
man
ought
to
do
and
anything
that
you
have
heard
to
the
contrary
is
calumnious
and
false
as
i
am
told
that
you
have
been
led
by
my
brother
statement
to
disinherit
your
nephew
i
have
done
nothing
of
the
kind
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
he
has
not
at
any
rate
deserved
it
and
i
have
felt
it
to
be
my
duty
to
come
and
tell
you
then
mountjoy
retired
not
without
hospitality
having
been
coldly
offered
by
prosper
and
went
back
to
buntingford
and
to
london
now
at
last
would
come
he
said
to
himself
through
the
whole
afternoon
now
at
last
would
come
a
repetition
of
those
joys
for
which
his
very
soul
had
sighed
so
eagerly
chapter
xlii
captain
vignolles
entertains
his
friends
mountjoy
when
he
reached
captain
vignolles
rooms
was
received
apparently
with
great
indifference
i
did
feel
at
all
sure
you
would
come
but
there
is
a
bit
of
supper
if
you
like
to
stay
i
saw
moody
this
morning
and
he
said
he
would
look
in
if
he
was
passing
this
way
now
sit
down
and
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
since
you
disappeared
in
that
remarkable
manner
this
was
not
at
all
what
mountjoy
had
expected
but
he
could
only
sit
down
and
say
that
he
had
done
nothing
in
particular
of
all
club
men
captain
vignolles
would
be
the
worst
with
whom
to
play
alone
during
the
entire
evening
and
mountjoy
remembered
now
that
he
had
never
been
inside
four
walls
with
vignolles
except
at
a
club
vignolles
regarded
him
simply
as
a
piece
of
prey
whom
chance
had
thrown
up
on
the
shore
and
moody
who
would
no
doubt
show
himself
before
long
was
another
bird
of
the
same
covey
though
less
rapacious
mountjoy
put
his
hand
up
to
his
and
knew
that
the
fifty
pounds
was
there
but
he
knew
also
that
it
would
soon
be
gone
even
to
him
it
seemed
to
be
expedient
to
get
up
and
at
once
to
go
what
delight
would
there
be
to
him
in
playing
piquet
with
such
a
face
opposite
to
him
as
that
of
captain
vignolles
or
with
such
a
one
as
that
of
old
moody
there
could
be
none
of
the
brilliance
of
the
room
no
pleasant
hum
of
the
voices
of
companions
no
sense
of
his
own
equality
with
others
there
would
be
none
to
sympathize
with
him
when
he
cursed
his
there
would
be
no
chance
of
contending
with
an
innocent
who
would
be
as
reckless
as
was
he
himself
he
looked
round
the
room
was
gloomy
and
uncomfortable
captain
vignolles
watched
him
and
was
afraid
that
his
prey
was
about
to
escape
wo
you
light
a
cigar
mountjoy
took
the
cigar
and
then
felt
that
he
could
not
go
quite
at
once
i
suppose
you
went
to
monaco
i
was
there
for
a
short
time
monaco
is
bad
though
there
is
of
course
the
pull
which
the
tables
have
against
you
but
it
a
grand
thing
to
think
that
skill
can
be
of
no
avail
i
often
think
that
i
ought
to
play
nothing
but
rouge
et
noir
you
yes
i
do
deny
that
i
the
luckiest
fellow
going
but
i
never
can
remember
cards
of
course
i
know
my
trade
every
fellow
knows
his
trade
and
i
up
pretty
nearly
in
all
that
the
books
tell
you
that
a
great
deal
not
when
you
come
to
play
with
men
who
know
what
play
is
look
at
grossengrannel
i
sooner
bet
on
him
than
any
man
in
london
grossengrannel
never
forgets
a
card
i
bet
a
hundred
pounds
that
he
knows
the
best
card
in
every
suit
throughout
the
entire
day
play
that
his
secret
he
gives
his
mind
to
it
which
i
ca
hang
it
always
thinking
of
something
quite
different
of
what
i
going
to
eat
or
that
sort
of
thing
grossengrannel
is
always
looking
at
the
cards
and
he
wins
the
odd
rubber
out
of
every
eleven
by
his
attention
shall
we
have
a
game
of
piquet
now
on
the
moment
in
spite
of
all
that
he
had
felt
during
the
entire
day
in
the
teeth
of
all
his
longings
in
opposition
to
all
his
thirst
mountjoy
for
a
minute
or
two
did
think
that
he
could
rise
and
go
his
father
was
about
to
put
him
on
his
legs
again
if
only
he
would
abstain
but
vignolles
had
the
open
with
clean
packs
and
chairs
at
the
corners
before
he
could
decide
what
is
it
to
be
twos
on
the
game
i
suppose
but
mountjoy
would
not
play
piquet
he
named
ecarte
and
asked
that
it
might
be
only
ten
shillings
a
game
it
was
many
months
now
since
he
had
played
a
game
of
ecarte
oh
hang
it
said
vignolles
still
holding
the
pack
in
his
hands
when
thus
appealed
to
mountjoy
relented
and
agreed
that
a
pound
should
be
staked
on
each
game
when
they
had
played
seven
games
vignolles
had
won
but
one
pound
and
expressed
an
opinion
that
that
kind
of
thing
would
suit
them
at
all
would
do
better
he
said
then
mountjoy
pushed
back
his
chair
as
though
to
go
when
the
door
opened
and
major
moody
entered
the
room
now
we
have
a
rubber
at
dummy
said
captain
vignolles
major
moody
was
a
old
man
of
about
sixty
who
played
his
cards
with
great
attention
and
never
spoke
a
word
either
then
or
at
any
other
period
of
his
life
he
was
the
most
taciturn
of
men
and
was
known
not
at
all
to
any
of
his
companions
it
was
rumored
of
him
that
he
had
a
wife
at
home
whom
he
kept
in
moderate
comfort
on
his
winnings
it
seemed
to
be
the
sole
desire
of
his
heart
to
play
with
reckless
foolish
young
men
who
up
to
a
certain
point
did
not
care
what
they
lost
he
was
popular
as
being
always
ready
to
oblige
every
one
and
as
was
frequently
said
of
him
was
the
very
soul
of
honor
he
certainly
got
no
amusement
from
the
play
working
at
it
very
hard
and
very
constantly
no
one
ever
saw
him
anywhere
but
at
the
club
at
eight
he
went
home
to
dinner
let
us
hope
to
the
wife
of
his
bosom
and
at
eleven
he
returned
and
remained
as
long
as
there
were
men
to
play
with
a
tedious
and
unsatisfactory
life
he
had
and
it
would
have
been
well
for
him
could
his
friends
have
procured
on
his
behoof
the
comparative
ease
of
a
stool
in
a
but
as
no
such
elysium
was
opened
to
him
the
major
went
on
accepting
the
smaller
profits
and
the
harder
work
of
club
life
in
what
regiment
he
had
been
a
major
no
one
knew
or
cared
to
inquire
he
had
been
received
as
major
moody
for
twenty
years
or
more
and
twenty
years
is
surely
time
enough
to
settle
a
man
claim
to
a
majority
without
reference
to
the
army
list
how
are
you
major
moody
asked
mountjoy
not
much
to
boast
of
i
hope
you
pretty
well
captain
scarborough
beyond
that
there
was
no
word
of
salutation
and
no
reference
to
mountjoy
wonderful
absence
what
it
to
be
twos
and
tens
said
captain
vignolles
arranging
the
cards
and
the
chairs
not
for
me
said
mountjoy
who
seemed
to
have
been
enveloped
by
a
most
unusual
prudence
what
are
you
afraid
you
who
used
to
fear
neither
man
nor
devil
there
is
so
much
in
not
being
accustomed
to
it
said
mountjoy
i
have
played
a
game
of
whist
since
i
do
knew
when
twos
and
tens
is
heavy
against
dummy
said
major
moody
i
take
dummy
if
you
like
it
said
vignolles
moody
only
looked
at
him
we
each
have
our
own
dummy
of
course
said
mountjoy
just
as
you
please
said
vignolles
i
host
here
and
of
course
will
give
way
to
anything
you
may
propose
what
it
to
be
scarborough
pounds
and
fives
i
sha
play
higher
than
that
there
came
across
mountjoy
mind
as
he
stated
the
stakes
for
which
he
consented
to
play
a
remembrance
that
in
the
old
days
he
had
always
been
called
captain
scarborough
by
this
man
who
now
left
out
the
captain
of
course
he
had
fallen
since
that
fallen
very
low
he
ought
to
feel
obliged
to
any
man
who
had
in
the
old
days
been
a
member
of
the
same
club
with
him
who
would
now
greet
him
with
the
familiarity
of
his
unadorned
name
but
the
remembrance
of
the
old
sounds
came
back
upon
his
ear
and
the
consciousness
that
before
his
father
treatment
of
him
he
had
been
known
to
the
world
at
large
as
captain
scarborough
of
tretton
well
well
pounds
and
fives
said
vignolles
it
better
than
pottering
away
at
ecarte
at
a
pound
a
game
of
course
a
man
could
win
something
if
the
games
were
to
run
all
one
way
but
where
they
alternate
so
quickly
it
amounts
to
nothing
you
got
the
first
dummy
scarborough
where
will
you
sit
which
cards
will
you
take
i
do
believe
that
at
whist
everything
depends
upon
the
cards
or
else
on
the
hinges
i
known
eleven
rubbers
running
to
follow
the
hinges
people
laugh
at
me
because
i
believe
in
luck
i
speak
as
i
find
it
that
all
turned
up
an
honor
already
when
a
man
begins
with
an
honor
he
always
go
on
with
honors
that
my
observation
i
know
you
pretty
good
at
this
game
moody
so
i
leave
it
to
you
to
arrange
the
play
and
will
follow
up
as
well
as
i
can
you
lead
up
to
the
weak
of
course
this
was
not
said
till
the
card
was
out
of
his
partner
hand
but
when
your
adversary
has
got
ace
king
queen
in
his
own
hand
there
is
no
weak
well
we
saved
that
and
it
as
much
as
we
can
expect
if
i
begun
by
leading
a
trump
it
would
have
been
all
over
with
us
wo
you
light
a
cigar
moody
i
never
smoke
at
cards
that
all
very
well
for
the
club
but
you
might
relax
a
little
here
scarborough
will
take
another
cigar
but
even
mountjoy
was
too
prudent
he
did
not
take
the
cigar
but
he
did
win
the
rubber
you
in
for
a
good
thing
i
feel
as
certain
of
it
as
though
the
money
were
in
your
pocket
mountjoy
though
he
would
not
smoke
did
drink
what
would
they
have
asked
vignolles
there
was
champagne
and
whiskey
and
brandy
he
was
afraid
there
was
no
other
wine
he
opened
a
bottle
of
champagne
and
mountjoy
took
the
tumbler
that
was
filled
for
him
he
always
drank
himself
so
he
said
and
filled
for
himself
a
glass
in
which
he
poured
a
very
small
allowance
of
alcohol
major
moody
asked
for
as
there
was
none
he
contented
himself
with
sipping
apollinaris
a
close
record
of
the
events
of
that
evening
would
make
but
a
tedious
tale
for
readers
mountjoy
of
course
lost
his
fifty
pounds
alas
he
lost
much
more
than
his
fifty
pounds
the
old
spirit
soon
came
upon
him
and
the
remembrance
of
what
his
father
was
to
do
for
him
passed
away
from
him
and
all
thoughts
of
his
adversaries
who
and
what
they
were
the
major
pertinaciously
refused
to
increase
his
stakes
and
worse
again
refused
to
play
for
anything
but
ready
money
it
a
kind
of
thing
i
never
do
you
may
think
me
very
odd
but
it
a
kind
of
thing
i
never
do
it
was
the
longest
speech
he
made
through
the
entire
evening
vignolles
reminded
him
that
he
did
in
fact
play
on
credit
at
the
club
the
committee
look
to
that
he
murmured
and
shook
his
head
then
vignolles
offered
again
to
take
the
dummy
so
that
there
should
be
no
necessity
for
moody
and
scarborough
to
play
against
each
other
and
offered
to
give
one
point
every
other
rubber
as
the
price
to
be
paid
for
the
advantage
but
moody
whose
success
for
the
night
was
assured
by
the
thirty
pounds
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
would
come
to
no
terms
you
mean
to
say
you
going
to
break
us
up
said
vignolles
that
be
hard
on
scarborough
i
go
on
for
money
said
the
immovable
major
i
suppose
you
wo
have
it
out
with
me
at
double
dummy
said
vignolles
to
his
victim
but
double
dummy
is
a
terrible
grind
at
this
time
of
night
and
he
pushed
all
the
cards
up
together
so
as
to
show
that
the
amusement
for
the
night
was
over
he
too
saw
the
difficulty
which
moody
so
pertinaciously
avoided
he
had
been
told
wondrous
things
of
the
old
squire
intentions
toward
his
eldest
son
but
he
had
been
told
them
only
by
that
eldest
son
himself
no
doubt
he
could
go
on
winning
unless
in
the
teeth
of
a
most
obstinate
run
of
cards
he
would
be
sure
to
win
against
scarborough
apparent
forgetfulness
of
all
rules
and
ignorance
of
the
peculiarities
of
the
game
he
was
playing
but
he
would
more
probably
obtain
payment
of
the
two
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
now
due
to
him
that
or
nearly
that
than
of
a
larger
sum
he
already
had
in
his
possession
the
other
twenty
pounds
which
poor
mountjoy
had
brought
with
him
so
he
let
the
victim
go
moody
went
first
and
vignolles
then
demanded
the
performance
of
a
small
ceremony
just
put
your
name
to
that
said
vignolles
it
was
a
written
promise
to
pay
to
captain
vignolles
the
exact
sum
of
two
hundred
and
pounds
on
or
before
that
day
week
you
be
punctual
wo
you
of
course
i
be
punctual
said
mountjoy
scowling
well
yes
no
doubt
but
there
have
been
mistakes
i
tell
you
you
be
paid
why
the
devil
did
you
win
it
of
me
if
you
doubt
it
i
saw
you
just
roaming
about
and
i
meant
to
be
you
know
as
well
as
any
man
what
chances
you
should
run
and
when
to
hold
your
hand
if
you
tell
me
about
mistakes
i
shall
make
it
personal
i
did
say
anything
scarborough
that
ought
to
be
taken
up
in
that
way
hang
your
scarborough
when
one
gentleman
talks
another
about
mistakes
he
means
something
then
he
smashed
down
his
hat
upon
his
head
and
left
the
room
vignolles
emptied
the
bottle
of
champagne
in
which
one
glass
was
left
and
sat
himself
down
with
the
document
in
his
hand
just
the
same
fellow
he
said
to
himself
overbearing
reckless
and
a
bully
he
lose
the
bank
of
england
if
he
had
it
but
then
he
pay
he
has
a
scruple
about
that
if
i
lose
i
have
to
pay
by
jove
yes
never
did
pay
a
shilling
i
lost
in
my
life
it
deuced
hard
when
a
fellow
is
on
the
square
like
that
to
make
two
ends
meet
when
he
comes
across
defaulters
those
fellows
should
be
hung
they
the
very
scum
of
the
earth
talk
of
welchers
they
worse
than
any
welcher
welcher
is
a
thing
you
need
have
to
do
with
if
you
careful
but
when
a
fellow
turns
round
upon
you
as
a
defaulter
at
cards
there
is
no
getting
rid
of
him
where
the
play
is
all
straightforward
and
honorable
a
defaulter
when
he
shows
himself
ought
to
be
murdered
such
were
captain
vignolles
plaints
to
himself
as
he
sat
there
looking
at
the
suspicious
document
which
mountjoy
had
left
in
his
hands
to
him
it
was
a
fact
that
he
had
been
cruelly
used
in
having
such
a
bit
of
paper
thrust
upon
him
instead
of
being
paid
by
a
check
which
on
the
morning
would
be
honored
and
as
he
thought
of
his
own
career
his
payments
his
obedience
to
certain
rules
of
the
game
rules
i
mean
against
cheating
as
he
thought
of
his
hands
which
in
his
own
estimation
were
beautifully
clean
his
diligence
in
his
profession
which
to
him
was
honorable
his
hard
work
his
late
hours
his
devotion
to
a
task
which
was
often
tedious
his
many
periods
of
loss
which
when
they
occurred
would
drive
him
nearly
mad
his
small
customary
gains
his
inability
to
put
by
anything
for
old
age
of
the
narrow
edge
by
which
he
himself
was
occasionally
divided
from
defalcation
he
spoke
to
himself
of
himself
as
of
an
honest
professional
man
upon
whom
the
world
was
peculiarly
hard
but
major
moody
went
home
to
his
wife
quite
content
with
the
thirty
pounds
which
he
had
won
chapter
xliii
prosper
is
visited
by
his
lawyers
prosper
had
not
been
in
good
spirits
at
the
time
at
which
mountjoy
scarborough
had
visited
him
he
had
received
some
time
previously
a
letter
from
grey
as
described
in
a
previous
chapter
and
had
also
known
exactly
what
proposal
had
been
made
by
grey
to
soames
simpson
an
equal
division
of
the
lady
income
one
half
to
go
to
the
lady
herself
and
the
other
half
to
prosper
with
an
annuity
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
out
of
the
estate
for
the
lady
if
prosper
should
die
first
these
were
the
terms
which
had
been
offered
to
miss
thoroughbung
with
the
object
of
inducing
her
to
become
the
wife
of
prosper
but
to
these
terms
miss
thoroughbung
had
declined
to
accede
and
had
gone
about
the
arrangement
of
her
in
a
most
precise
and
manner
a
third
of
her
income
she
would
give
up
since
prosper
desired
it
but
more
than
that
she
would
owe
it
to
herself
and
her
friends
to
decline
to
abandon
the
payment
for
the
fish
and
the
champagne
must
be
omitted
from
any
agreement
on
her
part
as
to
the
ponies
and
their
harness
and
the
she
would
supply
them
the
ponies
and
the
carriage
would
be
indispensable
to
her
happiness
but
the
maintenance
of
the
ponies
must
be
left
to
prosper
as
for
the
dower
she
could
not
consent
to
accept
less
than
four
hundred
or
five
hundred
if
no
house
was
to
be
provided
she
thought
that
seven
hundred
and
fifty
would
be
little
enough
if
there
were
no
children
as
in
that
case
there
was
no
heir
for
whom
prosper
was
especially
anxious
but
as
there
probably
would
be
children
miss
thoroughbung
thought
that
this
was
a
matter
to
which
prosper
would
not
give
much
consideration
throughout
it
all
she
maintained
a
beautiful
equanimity
and
made
two
or
three
efforts
to
induce
prosper
to
repeat
his
visit
to
marmaduke
lodge
she
herself
wrote
to
him
saying
that
she
thought
it
odd
that
considering
their
near
alliance
he
should
not
come
and
see
her
once
she
said
that
she
had
heard
that
he
was
ill
and
offered
to
go
to
buston
hall
to
visit
him
all
this
was
extremely
distressing
to
a
gentleman
of
delicate
feelings
as
to
the
proposals
in
regard
to
money
the
letters
from
soames
simpson
to
grey
barry
all
of
which
came
down
to
buston
hall
seemed
to
be
innumerable
with
soames
simpson
prosper
declined
to
have
any
personal
communication
but
every
letter
from
the
buntingford
attorneys
was
accompanied
by
a
farther
letter
from
the
london
attorneys
till
the
correspondence
became
insupportable
prosper
was
not
strong
enough
to
stick
firmly
to
his
guns
as
planted
for
him
by
grey
barry
he
did
give
way
in
some
matters
and
hence
arose
renewed
letters
which
nearly
drove
him
mad
soames
simpson
client
was
willing
to
accept
four
hundred
pounds
as
the
amount
of
the
dower
without
reference
to
the
house
and
to
this
prosper
yielded
he
did
not
much
care
about
any
heir
as
yet
unborn
and
felt
by
no
means
so
certain
in
regard
to
children
as
did
the
lady
but
he
fought
hard
about
the
ponies
he
could
not
undertake
that
his
wife
should
have
ponies
that
must
be
left
to
him
as
master
of
the
house
he
thought
that
a
pair
of
for
her
use
would
be
sufficient
he
had
always
kept
a
carriage
and
intended
to
do
so
she
might
bring
her
ponies
if
she
pleased
but
if
he
thought
well
to
part
with
them
he
would
sell
them
he
found
himself
getting
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
quagmire
till
he
began
to
doubt
whether
he
should
be
able
to
extricate
himself
unmarried
if
he
were
anxious
to
do
so
and
all
the
while
there
came
affectionate
little
notes
from
miss
thoroughbung
asking
after
his
health
and
recommending
him
what
to
take
till
he
entertained
serious
thoughts
of
going
to
cairo
for
the
winter
then
barry
came
down
to
see
him
after
mountjoy
had
made
his
visit
it
was
now
january
and
the
bargaining
about
the
marriage
had
gone
on
for
more
than
two
months
the
letter
which
he
had
received
from
the
squire
of
tretton
had
moved
him
but
he
had
told
himself
that
the
property
was
his
own
and
that
he
had
a
right
to
enjoy
it
as
he
liked
best
whatever
might
have
been
harry
faults
in
regard
to
that
midnight
affair
it
had
certainly
been
true
that
he
had
declined
to
hear
the
sermons
prosper
did
not
exactly
mention
the
sermons
to
himself
but
there
was
present
to
him
a
feeling
that
his
heir
had
been
wilfully
disobedient
and
the
sermons
no
doubt
had
been
the
cause
when
he
had
read
the
old
squire
letter
he
did
not
as
yet
wish
to
forgive
his
nephew
he
was
becoming
very
tired
of
his
courtship
but
in
his
estimation
the
wife
would
be
better
than
the
nephew
though
he
had
been
much
put
out
by
the
precocity
of
that
embrace
there
was
nevertheless
a
sweetness
about
it
which
lingered
on
his
lips
then
mountjoy
had
come
down
and
he
had
answered
mountjoy
very
stoutly
a
lie
he
had
exclaimed
did
he
tell
a
lie
he
had
asked
as
though
all
must
be
over
with
a
young
man
who
had
once
allowed
himself
to
depart
from
the
rigid
truth
mountjoy
had
made
what
excuse
he
could
but
prosper
had
been
very
stern
on
the
very
day
after
mountjoy
coming
barry
came
his
visit
had
been
arranged
and
prosper
was
with
great
care
prepared
to
encounter
him
he
was
wrapped
in
his
best
and
matthew
had
shaved
him
with
the
greatest
care
the
girls
over
at
the
parsonage
declared
that
their
uncle
had
sent
into
buntingford
for
a
special
pot
of
pomatum
the
story
was
told
to
joe
thoroughbung
in
order
that
it
might
be
passed
on
to
his
aunt
and
no
doubt
it
did
travel
as
it
was
intended
but
miss
thoroughbung
cared
nothing
for
the
pomatum
with
which
the
lawyer
from
london
was
to
be
received
it
would
be
very
hard
to
laugh
her
out
of
her
lover
while
the
to
buston
held
good
but
prosper
had
felt
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
look
his
best
so
that
his
marriage
might
be
justified
in
the
eyes
of
the
lawyer
barry
was
shown
into
the
at
buston
in
which
prosper
was
seated
ready
to
receive
him
the
two
gentlemen
had
never
before
met
each
other
and
prosper
did
no
doubt
assume
something
of
the
manner
of
an
aristocratic
owner
of
land
he
would
not
have
done
so
had
grey
come
in
his
partner
place
but
there
was
a
humility
about
barry
on
an
occasion
such
as
the
present
which
justified
a
little
pride
on
the
part
of
the
client
i
am
sorry
to
give
you
the
trouble
to
come
down
barry
he
said
i
hope
the
servant
has
shown
you
your
room
i
shall
be
back
in
london
prosper
thank
you
i
must
see
these
lawyers
here
and
when
i
have
received
your
final
instructions
i
will
return
to
buntingford
then
prosper
pressed
him
much
to
stay
he
had
quite
expected
he
said
that
barry
would
have
done
him
the
pleasure
of
remaining
at
any
rate
one
night
at
buston
but
barry
settled
the
question
by
saying
that
he
had
not
brought
a
prosper
did
not
care
to
sit
down
to
dinner
with
guests
who
did
not
bring
their
and
now
continued
barry
what
final
instructions
are
we
to
give
to
soames
simpson
i
do
think
much
of
soames
simpson
i
believe
they
have
the
name
of
being
honest
practitioners
i
dare
say
i
do
not
in
the
least
doubt
it
but
they
are
people
to
whom
i
am
not
at
all
desirous
of
intrusting
my
own
private
affairs
soames
simpson
have
not
i
think
a
large
county
business
i
had
no
idea
that
miss
thoroughbung
would
have
put
this
affair
into
their
hands
just
so
prosper
but
i
suppose
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
employ
somebody
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
correspondence
indeed
there
has
mr
barry
it
has
not
been
our
fault
prosper
now
what
we
have
got
to
decide
is
this
what
are
the
final
terms
which
you
mean
to
propose
i
think
sir
the
time
has
come
when
some
final
terms
should
be
suggested
just
so
final
terms
must
be
what
you
call
the
very
last
that
is
when
they
have
once
been
offered
you
must
must
just
stick
to
them
mr
prosper
exactly
barry
that
is
what
i
intend
there
is
nothing
i
dislike
so
much
as
this
haggling
about
money
especially
with
a
lady
miss
thoroughbung
is
a
lady
for
whom
i
have
the
highest
possible
esteem
that
of
course
for
whom
i
repeat
i
have
the
highest
possible
esteem
but
she
has
friends
who
have
their
own
ideas
as
to
money
the
brewery
in
buntingford
belongs
to
them
and
they
are
very
worthy
people
i
should
explain
to
you
barry
as
you
are
my
confidential
adviser
that
were
i
about
to
form
a
matrimonial
alliance
in
the
heyday
of
my
youth
i
should
probably
not
have
thought
of
connecting
myself
with
the
thoroughbungs
as
i
have
said
before
they
are
most
respectable
people
but
they
do
not
exactly
belong
to
that
class
in
which
i
should
under
those
circumstances
have
looked
for
a
wife
i
might
probably
have
ventured
to
ask
for
the
hand
of
the
daughter
of
some
county
family
but
years
have
slipped
by
me
and
now
wishing
in
middle
life
to
procure
for
myself
the
comfort
of
wedded
happiness
i
have
looked
about
and
have
found
no
one
more
likely
to
give
it
me
than
miss
thoroughbung
her
temper
is
excellent
and
her
person
pleasing
prosper
as
he
said
this
thought
of
the
kiss
which
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
her
wit
is
vivacious
and
i
think
that
upon
the
whole
she
will
be
desirable
as
a
companion
she
will
not
come
to
this
house
but
of
her
pecuniary
affairs
you
already
know
so
much
that
i
need
perhaps
tell
you
nothing
farther
but
though
i
am
exceedingly
desirous
to
make
this
lady
my
wife
and
am
i
may
say
warmly
attached
to
her
there
are
certain
points
which
i
can
not
sacrifice
now
about
the
ponies
i
think
i
understand
about
the
ponies
she
may
bring
them
on
trial
i
not
to
be
bound
to
keep
any
ponies
at
all
there
are
a
pair
of
which
must
suffice
on
second
thoughts
she
had
better
not
bring
the
ponies
this
decision
had
at
last
come
from
some
little
doubt
on
his
mind
as
to
whether
he
was
treating
harry
justly
and
four
hundred
pounds
is
the
sum
fixed
on
for
her
jointure
she
is
to
have
her
own
money
for
her
own
life
said
prosper
that
a
matter
of
course
do
you
think
that
under
these
circumstances
four
hundred
will
be
quite
enough
quite
enough
if
you
ask
me
but
we
must
decide
four
hundred
it
shall
be
and
she
is
to
have
of
her
own
money
for
her
own
expenses
during
your
life
asked
barry
i
do
see
why
she
should
want
six
hundred
a
year
for
herself
i
indeed
i
am
afraid
it
will
only
lead
to
extravagance
barry
assumed
a
look
of
despair
of
course
as
i
have
said
so
i
will
not
go
back
from
my
word
she
shall
have
but
about
the
ponies
my
mind
is
quite
made
up
there
shall
be
no
ponies
at
buston
i
hope
you
understand
that
mr
barry
barry
said
that
he
did
understand
it
well
and
then
folding
up
his
papers
prepared
to
go
congratulating
himself
that
he
would
not
have
to
pass
a
long
evening
at
buston
hall
but
before
he
went
and
when
he
had
already
put
on
his
in
the
hall
prosper
called
him
back
to
ask
him
one
farther
question
and
for
that
purpose
he
shut
the
door
carefully
and
uttered
his
words
in
a
whisper
did
barry
know
anything
of
the
life
and
recent
adventures
of
henry
annesley
barry
knew
nothing
but
he
thought
that
his
partner
grey
knew
something
he
had
heard
grey
mention
the
name
of
henry
annesley
then
as
he
stood
there
enveloped
in
his
with
his
horse
standing
in
the
cold
prosper
told
him
much
of
the
story
of
harry
annesley
and
asked
him
to
induce
grey
to
write
and
tell
him
what
he
thought
of
harry
conduct
chapter
xliv
prosper
troubles
as
prosper
sunk
into
his
after
the
fatigue
of
the
interview
with
his
lawyer
he
reflected
that
when
all
was
considered
harry
annesley
was
an
ungrateful
pig
it
was
thus
he
called
him
and
that
miss
thoroughbung
had
many
attractions
miss
thoroughbung
had
probably
done
well
to
kiss
him
though
the
enterprise
had
not
been
without
its
peculiar
dangers
he
often
thought
of
it
when
alone
and
as
distance
lent
enchantment
to
the
view
he
longed
to
have
the
experiment
repeated
perhaps
she
had
been
right
and
it
would
be
a
good
thing
certainly
to
have
dear
little
children
of
his
own
miss
thoroughbung
felt
very
certain
on
the
subject
and
it
would
be
foolish
for
him
to
doubt
then
he
thought
of
the
difference
between
a
pretty
fair
haired
little
boy
and
that
ungrateful
pig
harry
annesley
he
told
himself
that
he
was
very
fond
of
children
the
girls
over
at
the
parsonage
would
not
have
said
so
but
they
probably
did
not
know
his
character
when
harry
had
come
back
with
his
fellowship
his
uncle
had
for
a
few
weeks
been
very
proud
of
him
had
declared
that
he
should
never
be
called
upon
to
earn
his
bread
and
had
allowed
him
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
to
begin
with
but
no
return
had
been
made
to
this
favor
harry
had
walked
in
and
out
of
the
hall
as
though
it
had
already
belonged
to
him
as
many
a
father
delights
to
see
his
eldest
son
doing
but
the
uncle
in
this
instance
had
not
taken
any
delight
in
seeing
it
an
uncle
is
different
from
a
father
an
uncle
who
has
never
had
a
child
of
his
own
he
wanted
deference
what
he
would
have
called
respect
while
harry
was
at
first
prepared
to
give
him
a
familiar
affection
based
on
equality
on
an
equality
in
money
matters
and
worldly
interests
though
i
fear
that
harry
allowed
to
be
seen
his
own
intellectual
superiority
prosper
though
an
ignorant
man
and
by
no
means
clever
was
not
such
a
fool
as
not
to
see
all
this
then
had
come
the
persistent
refusal
to
hear
the
sermons
and
prosper
had
sorrowfully
declared
to
himself
that
his
heir
was
not
the
young
man
that
he
should
have
been
he
did
not
then
think
of
marrying
nor
did
he
stop
the
allowance
but
he
did
feel
that
his
heir
was
not
what
he
should
have
been
but
then
the
terrible
disgrace
of
that
night
in
london
had
occurred
and
his
eyes
had
been
altogether
opened
by
that
excellent
young
man
augustus
scarborough
then
he
began
to
look
about
him
then
dim
ideas
of
the
charms
and
immediate
wealth
of
miss
thoroughbung
flitted
before
his
eyes
and
he
told
himself
again
and
again
of
the
prospects
and
undoubted
good
birth
of
miss
puffle
miss
puffle
had
disgraced
herself
and
therefore
he
had
thrown
buston
hall
at
the
feet
of
miss
thoroughbung
but
now
he
had
heard
stories
about
that
excellent
young
man
augustus
scarborough
which
had
shaken
his
faith
he
had
been
able
to
exclaim
indignantly
that
harry
annesley
had
told
a
lie
a
lie
he
had
been
surprised
to
find
that
a
young
man
who
had
lived
so
much
in
the
fashionable
world
as
captain
scarborough
had
cared
nothing
for
this
and
as
miss
thoroughbung
became
more
and
more
exacting
in
regard
to
money
he
thought
himself
less
and
less
of
the
lie
it
might
be
well
that
harry
should
ultimately
have
the
property
though
he
should
never
again
be
taken
into
favor
and
there
should
be
no
farther
question
of
the
allowance
as
miss
thoroughbung
reiterated
her
demands
for
the
ponies
he
began
to
feel
that
the
acres
of
buston
would
not
be
disgraced
forever
by
the
telling
of
that
lie
but
the
sermons
remained
and
he
would
never
willingly
again
see
his
nephew
as
he
turned
all
this
in
his
mind
the
idea
of
spending
what
was
left
of
the
winter
at
cairo
returned
to
him
he
would
go
to
cairo
for
the
winter
and
to
the
italian
lakes
for
the
spring
and
to
switzerland
for
the
summer
then
he
might
return
to
cairo
at
the
present
moment
buston
hall
and
the
neighborhood
of
buntingford
had
few
charms
for
him
he
was
afraid
that
miss
thoroughbung
would
not
give
way
about
the
ponies
and
against
the
ponies
he
was
resolved
he
was
sitting
in
this
state
with
a
map
before
him
and
with
the
squire
letter
upon
the
map
when
matthew
the
butler
opened
the
door
and
announced
a
visitor
as
soon
as
barry
had
gone
he
had
supported
nature
by
a
and
a
glass
of
sherry
and
the
debris
were
now
lying
on
the
his
first
idea
was
to
bid
matthew
at
once
remove
the
glass
and
the
bone
and
the
unfinished
potato
and
the
crust
of
bread
to
be
taken
with
such
remnants
by
any
visitor
would
be
bad
but
by
this
visitor
would
be
dreadful
lunch
should
be
eaten
in
the
where
chop
bones
and
dirty
glasses
would
be
in
their
place
but
here
in
his
they
would
be
disgraceful
but
then
as
matthew
was
hurriedly
collecting
the
two
plates
and
the
his
master
began
to
doubt
whether
this
visitor
should
be
received
at
all
it
was
no
other
than
miss
thoroughbung
prosper
in
order
to
excuse
his
slackness
in
calling
on
the
lady
had
let
it
be
known
that
he
was
not
quite
well
and
miss
thoroughbung
had
responded
to
this
move
by
offering
her
services
as
nurse
to
her
lover
he
had
then
written
to
herself
that
though
he
had
been
a
little
unwell
suffering
from
a
cold
in
the
chest
to
which
at
this
inclement
season
of
the
year
it
was
peculiarly
liable
he
was
not
in
need
of
anything
beyond
a
little
personal
attention
and
would
not
trouble
her
for
those
services
for
the
offer
of
which
he
was
bound
to
be
peculiarly
grateful
thus
he
had
thought
to
keep
miss
thoroughbung
at
a
distance
but
here
she
was
with
those
hated
ponies
at
his
very
door
matthew
he
said
making
a
confidant
in
the
distress
of
the
moment
of
his
butler
i
do
think
i
can
see
her
you
must
sir
indeed
you
must
must
well
yes
i
afraid
so
considering
all
things
the
matrimonial
prospects
and
the
rest
of
it
i
think
you
must
sir
she
has
a
right
to
come
here
you
know
as
yet
it
will
be
understood
that
prosper
was
considerably
discomposed
when
he
spoke
with
such
familiar
confidence
to
his
servant
she
need
come
in
here
at
any
rate
in
the
if
i
might
be
allowed
to
suggest
sir
show
miss
thoroughbung
into
the
said
he
with
all
his
dignity
then
matthew
retired
and
the
squire
of
buston
felt
that
five
minutes
might
be
allowed
to
collect
himself
and
the
bone
need
not
be
removed
when
the
five
minutes
were
over
with
slow
steps
he
walked
across
the
intervening
and
slowly
opened
the
door
would
she
rush
into
his
arms
and
kiss
him
again
as
he
entered
he
sincerely
hoped
that
there
would
be
no
such
attempt
but
if
there
were
he
was
sternly
resolved
to
repudiate
it
there
should
be
nothing
of
the
kind
till
she
had
clearly
declared
and
had
put
it
under
writing
by
herself
and
her
lawyers
that
she
would
consent
to
come
to
buston
without
the
ponies
but
there
was
no
such
attempt
how
do
you
do
mr
prosper
she
said
in
a
loud
voice
standing
up
in
the
middle
of
the
room
why
do
you
ever
come
and
see
me
i
take
it
very
ill
of
you
and
so
does
miss
tickle
there
is
no
one
more
partial
to
you
than
miss
tickle
we
were
talking
of
you
only
last
night
over
a
despatched
crab
that
we
had
for
supper
did
they
have
despatched
crabs
for
supper
every
night
thought
prosper
to
himself
it
was
certainly
a
strong
reason
against
his
marriage
i
told
her
that
you
had
a
cold
in
your
head
in
my
chest
said
prosper
meekly
colds
said
miss
tickle
people
are
keeping
company
together
they
ought
to
see
each
other
those
were
miss
tickle
very
words
that
it
should
be
said
of
him
prosper
of
buston
that
he
was
keeping
company
with
any
woman
he
almost
resolved
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
under
no
circumstances
could
he
now
marry
miss
thoroughbung
but
unfortunately
his
offer
had
been
made
and
the
terms
of
the
settlement
as
suggested
by
himself
placed
in
the
hands
of
his
lawyer
if
miss
thoroughbung
chose
to
hold
him
to
his
offer
he
must
marry
her
it
was
not
that
he
feared
an
action
for
breach
of
promise
but
that
as
a
gentleman
it
would
behoove
him
to
be
true
to
his
word
he
need
not
however
marry
miss
tickle
he
had
offered
no
terms
in
respect
to
miss
tickle
with
great
presence
of
mind
he
resolved
at
once
that
miss
tickle
should
never
find
a
permanent
for
her
foot
at
buston
hall
i
am
extremely
indebted
to
miss
tickle
said
he
why
have
you
come
over
just
to
have
a
little
chat
in
a
friendly
way
it
all
because
of
those
stupid
lawyers
i
suppose
what
need
you
and
i
care
for
the
lawyers
they
can
do
their
work
without
troubling
us
except
that
they
will
be
sure
to
send
in
their
bills
fast
enough
i
have
had
barry
from
the
firm
of
grey
barry
of
lincoln
inn
with
me
this
morning
i
know
you
have
i
saw
the
little
man
at
soames
simpson
and
drove
out
here
immediately
after
five
minutes
conversation
now
prosper
you
must
let
me
have
those
ponies
that
was
the
very
thing
which
he
was
determined
not
to
do
the
ponies
grew
in
imagination
and
became
enormous
horses
capable
of
consuming
any
amount
of
oats
prosper
was
not
of
a
stingy
nature
but
he
had
already
perceived
that
his
escape
if
it
were
effected
must
be
made
good
by
means
of
those
ponies
a
steady
old
pair
of
had
been
kept
by
him
and
by
his
father
before
him
and
he
was
not
going
to
be
driven
out
of
the
old
family
ways
by
a
brewer
daughter
and
he
had
but
that
morning
instructed
his
lawyer
to
stand
out
against
the
ponies
he
felt
that
this
was
the
moment
for
firmness
now
this
instant
he
must
be
staunch
or
he
would
be
saddled
with
this
woman
and
with
miss
tickle
for
the
whole
of
his
life
she
had
left
him
no
time
for
consideration
but
had
come
upon
him
as
soon
almost
as
the
words
spoken
to
the
lawyer
had
been
out
of
his
mouth
but
he
would
be
firm
miss
thoroughbung
opened
out
instantly
about
the
ponies
and
he
at
once
resolved
that
he
would
be
firm
but
was
it
not
very
indelicate
on
her
part
to
come
to
him
and
to
press
him
in
this
manner
he
began
to
hope
that
she
also
would
be
firm
about
the
ponies
and
that
in
this
way
the
separation
might
be
effected
at
the
present
moment
he
stood
dumb
silence
would
not
in
this
case
be
considered
as
giving
consent
now
like
a
good
man
do
say
that
i
shall
have
the
ponies
she
continued
i
can
keep
out
of
my
own
money
you
know
if
that
all
he
perceived
at
once
that
the
offer
amounted
to
a
certain
yielding
on
her
part
but
he
was
no
longer
anxious
that
she
should
give
way
now
say
yes
like
a
dear
old
boy
she
came
closer
to
him
and
took
hold
of
his
arm
as
though
she
were
going
to
perform
that
other
ceremony
but
he
was
fully
aware
of
the
danger
if
there
came
to
be
kissing
between
them
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
back
afterward
in
such
a
manner
but
that
the
blame
of
the
kiss
should
rest
with
him
when
he
should
desire
to
be
off
he
could
not
plead
that
the
kissing
had
been
all
her
doing
a
man
in
prosper
position
has
difficulties
among
which
he
must
be
very
wary
and
then
the
ridicule
of
the
world
is
so
strong
a
weapon
and
is
always
used
on
the
side
of
the
women
he
gave
a
little
start
but
he
did
not
at
once
shake
her
off
what
the
objection
to
the
ponies
dear
two
pair
of
horses
it
more
than
we
ought
to
keep
he
should
not
have
said
we
he
felt
when
it
was
too
late
that
he
should
not
have
said
we
they
are
horses
it
the
same
as
far
as
the
stables
are
concerned
but
there
room
enough
lord
bless
you
i
been
in
to
look
i
can
assure
you
that
stubbs
says
they
are
required
for
my
health
you
ask
him
else
it
just
what
i
up
to
is
driving
i
only
taken
to
them
lately
and
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
give
up
love
you
not
going
to
throw
over
your
own
matilda
for
a
couple
of
little
beasts
like
that
every
word
that
came
out
of
her
mouth
was
an
offence
but
he
could
not
tell
her
so
nor
could
he
reject
her
on
that
score
he
should
have
thought
beforehand
what
kind
of
words
might
probably
come
out
of
her
mouth
was
her
name
matilda
of
course
he
knew
the
fact
had
any
one
asked
him
he
could
have
said
with
two
minutes
consideration
that
her
name
was
matilda
but
it
had
never
become
familiar
to
his
ears
and
now
she
spoke
of
it
as
though
he
had
called
her
matilda
since
their
earliest
youth
and
to
be
called
love
it
might
be
very
nice
when
he
had
first
called
her
love
a
dozen
times
but
now
it
sounded
extravagant
and
almost
indelicate
and
he
was
about
to
throw
her
over
for
a
couple
of
little
beasts
he
felt
that
that
was
his
intention
and
he
blushed
because
it
was
so
he
was
a
true
gentleman
who
would
not
willingly
depart
from
his
word
if
he
must
go
on
with
the
ponies
he
must
but
he
had
never
yet
yielded
about
the
ponies
he
felt
now
that
they
were
his
only
hope
but
as
the
difficulties
of
his
position
pressed
upon
him
the
sweat
stood
out
upon
his
brow
she
saw
it
all
and
understood
it
all
and
deliberately
determined
to
take
advantage
of
his
weakness
i
think
that
there
is
anything
else
astray
between
us
we
settled
about
the
jointure
four
hundred
a
year
it
too
little
soames
simpson
say
but
i
soft
and
in
love
you
know
here
she
leered
at
him
and
he
began
to
hate
her
you
ought
to
want
a
third
of
my
income
you
know
but
you
to
be
lord
and
master
and
you
must
have
your
own
way
all
that
settled
there
is
miss
tickle
he
said
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
cadaverous
miss
tickle
is
of
course
to
come
you
said
that
from
the
very
first
moment
when
you
made
the
offer
never
oh
peter
how
can
you
say
so
he
shrunk
visibly
from
the
sound
of
his
own
christian
name
but
she
determined
to
persevere
the
time
must
come
when
she
should
call
him
peter
and
why
not
commence
the
practice
now
at
once
lovers
always
do
call
each
other
peter
and
matilda
she
going
to
stand
any
nonsense
and
if
he
intended
to
marry
her
and
use
a
large
proportion
of
her
fortune
peter
he
should
be
to
her
you
did
peter
you
know
you
told
me
how
much
attached
you
were
to
her
i
did
say
anything
about
her
coming
with
you
oh
peter
how
can
you
be
so
cruel
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
will
deprive
me
of
the
friend
of
my
youth
at
any
rate
there
shall
never
be
a
pony
come
into
my
yard
he
knew
when
he
made
this
assertion
that
he
was
abandoning
his
objection
to
miss
tickle
she
had
called
him
cruel
and
his
conscience
told
him
that
if
he
received
miss
thoroughbung
and
refused
admission
to
miss
tickle
he
would
be
cruel
miss
tickle
for
aught
that
he
knew
might
have
been
a
friend
of
her
youth
at
any
rate
they
had
been
constant
companions
for
many
years
therefore
as
he
had
another
solid
ground
on
which
to
stand
he
could
afford
to
yield
as
to
miss
tickle
but
as
he
did
so
he
remembered
that
miss
tickle
had
accused
him
of
keeping
company
and
he
declared
to
himself
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
her
but
miss
tickle
may
come
said
miss
thoroughbung
was
the
solid
ground
the
rock
as
he
believed
it
to
be
of
the
ponies
about
to
sink
beneath
his
feet
say
that
miss
tickle
may
come
i
should
be
nothing
without
miss
tickle
you
can
not
be
so
as
that
i
do
see
what
is
the
good
of
talking
about
miss
tickle
till
we
have
come
to
some
settlement
about
the
ponies
you
say
that
you
must
have
the
ponies
to
tell
you
the
truth
miss
thoroughbung
i
do
like
any
such
word
as
and
a
good
many
things
have
occurred
to
me
what
kind
of
things
deary
i
think
you
are
inclined
to
be
gay
me
gay
while
i
am
sober
and
perhaps
a
little
grave
in
my
manners
of
life
i
am
thinking
only
of
domestic
happiness
while
your
mind
is
intent
upon
social
circles
i
fear
that
you
would
look
for
your
bliss
abroad
in
france
or
germany
when
i
say
abroad
i
mean
out
of
your
own
house
there
is
perhaps
some
discrepancy
of
taste
of
which
i
ought
earlier
to
have
taken
cognizance
nothing
of
the
kind
said
miss
thoroughbung
i
am
quite
content
to
live
at
home
and
do
not
want
to
go
abroad
either
to
france
nor
yet
to
any
other
english
county
i
should
never
ask
for
anything
unless
it
be
for
a
single
month
in
london
here
was
a
ground
upon
which
he
perhaps
could
make
his
stand
quite
impossible
said
prosper
or
for
a
fortnight
said
miss
thoroughbung
i
never
go
up
to
london
except
on
business
but
i
might
go
alone
you
know
with
miss
tickle
i
should
want
to
drag
you
away
i
have
always
been
in
the
habit
of
having
a
few
weeks
in
london
about
the
exhibition
time
i
should
wish
to
be
left
by
my
wife
of
course
we
could
manage
all
that
we
not
to
settle
every
little
thing
beforehand
and
put
it
into
the
deeds
a
precious
sum
we
should
have
to
pay
the
lawyers
it
as
well
we
should
understand
each
other
i
think
it
pretty
nearly
is
all
settled
that
has
to
go
into
the
deeds
i
thought
i
just
run
over
after
seeing
barry
and
give
the
final
touch
if
you
give
way
dear
about
miss
tickle
and
the
ponies
yield
in
everything
else
nothing
surely
can
be
fairer
than
that
he
knew
that
he
was
playing
the
hypocrite
and
he
knew
also
that
it
did
not
become
him
as
a
gentleman
to
be
false
to
a
woman
he
was
aware
that
from
minute
to
minute
and
almost
from
word
to
word
he
was
becoming
ever
more
and
more
averse
to
this
match
which
he
had
proposed
to
himself
and
he
knew
that
in
honesty
he
ought
to
tell
her
that
it
was
so
it
was
not
honest
in
him
to
endeavor
to
get
rid
of
her
by
a
as
it
were
and
yet
this
was
the
attempt
which
he
had
hitherto
been
making
but
how
was
he
to
tell
her
the
truth
even
barry
had
not
understood
the
state
of
his
mind
indeed
his
mind
had
altered
since
he
had
seen
barry
he
had
heard
within
the
last
half
hour
many
words
spoken
by
miss
thoroughbung
which
proved
that
she
was
altogether
unfit
to
be
his
wife
it
was
a
dreadful
misfortune
that
he
should
have
rushed
into
such
peril
but
was
he
not
bound
as
a
gentleman
to
tell
her
the
truth
say
that
i
shall
have
jemima
tickle
the
added
horrors
of
the
christian
name
operated
upon
him
with
additional
force
was
he
to
be
doomed
to
have
the
word
jemima
hallooed
about
his
rooms
and
staircases
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
she
had
given
up
the
ponies
and
was
taking
her
stand
upon
miss
tickle
as
to
whom
at
last
he
would
be
bound
to
give
way
he
could
see
now
that
he
should
have
demanded
her
whole
income
and
have
allowed
her
little
or
no
jointure
that
would
have
been
grasping
monstrous
altogether
impracticable
but
it
would
not
have
been
this
chaffering
about
little
things
was
altogether
at
variance
with
his
tastes
and
it
would
be
futile
he
must
summon
courage
to
tell
her
that
he
no
longer
wished
for
the
match
but
he
could
not
do
it
on
this
morning
then
for
that
morning
some
benign
god
preserved
him
matthew
came
into
the
room
and
whispered
into
his
ear
that
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
him
what
gentleman
matthew
again
whispered
that
it
was
his
show
him
in
said
prosper
with
a
sudden
courage
he
had
not
seen
annesley
since
the
day
of
his
actual
quarrel
with
harry
i
shall
have
the
ponies
said
miss
thoroughbung
during
the
moment
that
was
allowed
to
her
we
are
interrupted
now
i
am
afraid
that
the
rest
of
this
interview
must
be
postponed
it
should
never
be
renewed
though
he
might
have
to
leave
the
country
forever
of
that
he
gave
himself
assurance
then
the
parson
was
shown
into
the
room
the
constrained
introduction
was
very
painful
to
prosper
but
was
not
at
all
disagreeable
to
the
lady
annesley
knows
me
very
well
we
are
quite
old
friends
joe
is
going
to
marry
his
eldest
girl
i
hope
molly
is
quite
well
the
rector
said
that
molly
was
quite
well
when
he
had
come
away
from
home
just
now
he
had
left
joe
at
the
parsonage
you
find
him
there
a
deal
oftener
than
at
the
brewery
said
miss
thoroughbung
you
know
what
we
going
to
do
annesley
there
are
no
fools
like
old
fools
a
cloud
came
across
prosper
face
that
this
woman
should
dare
to
call
him
an
old
fool
we
were
discussing
a
few
of
our
future
arrangements
we
arranged
everything
about
money
in
the
most
amicable
manner
and
now
there
is
merely
a
question
of
a
pair
of
ponies
we
need
not
trouble
annesley
about
that
i
think
and
miss
tickle
i
sure
the
rector
will
agree
with
me
that
old
friends
like
me
and
miss
tickle
ought
not
to
be
separated
and
it
as
though
there
was
any
dislike
between
them
because
he
has
already
said
that
he
finds
miss
tickle
charming
d
miss
tickle
he
said
whereupon
the
rector
looked
astonished
and
miss
thoroughbung
jumped
a
foot
from
off
the
ground
i
beg
the
pardon
said
prosper
piteously
and
yours
miss
thoroughbung
and
yours
mr
annesley
it
was
as
though
a
new
revelation
of
character
had
been
given
no
one
except
matthew
had
ever
heard
the
squire
of
buston
swear
and
with
matthew
the
cursings
had
been
by
no
means
frequent
and
had
been
addressed
generally
to
some
article
of
his
clothing
or
to
some
morsel
of
food
prepared
with
less
than
the
usual
care
but
now
the
oath
had
been
directed
against
a
female
and
the
chosen
friend
of
his
betrothed
and
it
had
been
uttered
in
the
presence
of
a
clergyman
his
and
the
rector
of
his
parish
prosper
felt
that
he
was
disgraced
forever
could
he
have
overheard
them
laughing
over
his
ebullition
in
the
half
an
hour
afterward
and
almost
praising
his
violence
some
part
of
the
pain
might
have
been
removed
as
it
was
he
felt
at
the
time
that
he
was
disgraced
forever
we
will
return
to
the
subject
when
next
we
meet
said
miss
thoroughbung
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
should
so
far
have
forgotten
myself
said
prosper
but
it
does
not
signify
not
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
she
made
a
little
motion
to
the
clergyman
half
bow
and
half
courtesy
annesley
bowed
in
return
as
though
declaring
that
neither
did
it
signify
very
much
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
then
she
left
the
room
and
matthew
handed
her
into
the
carriage
when
she
took
the
ponies
in
hand
with
quite
as
much
composure
as
though
her
friend
had
not
been
sworn
at
upon
my
word
sir
said
prosper
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
was
so
moved
by
certain
things
which
have
occurred
that
i
was
carried
much
beyond
my
usual
habits
do
mention
it
it
is
peculiarly
distressing
to
me
that
i
should
have
been
induced
to
forget
myself
in
the
presence
of
a
clergyman
of
the
parish
and
my
but
i
must
beg
you
to
forget
it
oh
certainly
i
will
tell
you
now
why
i
have
come
over
i
can
assure
you
that
such
is
not
my
habit
continued
prosper
who
was
thinking
much
more
of
the
unaccustomed
oath
which
he
had
sworn
than
of
his
visit
strange
as
it
was
no
one
as
a
rule
is
more
guarded
in
his
expressions
than
i
am
how
it
should
have
come
to
pass
that
i
was
so
stirred
i
can
hardly
tell
but
miss
thoroughbung
had
said
certain
words
which
had
moved
me
very
much
she
had
called
him
peter
and
deary
and
had
spoken
of
him
as
keeping
company
with
her
all
these
disgusting
terms
of
endearment
he
could
not
repeat
to
his
but
felt
it
necessary
to
allude
to
them
i
trust
that
you
may
be
happy
with
her
when
she
is
your
wife
i
ca
say
i
really
do
know
it
a
very
important
step
to
take
at
my
age
and
i
not
quite
sure
that
i
should
be
doing
wisely
it
not
too
late
said
annesley
i
do
know
i
ca
quite
say
then
prosper
drew
himself
up
remembering
that
it
would
not
become
him
to
discuss
the
matter
of
his
marriage
with
the
father
of
his
heir
i
have
come
over
here
said
annesley
to
say
a
few
words
about
harry
prosper
again
drew
himself
up
of
course
you
aware
that
harry
is
at
present
living
with
us
here
prosper
bowed
of
course
in
his
altered
circumstances
it
will
not
do
that
he
shall
be
idle
and
yet
he
does
not
like
to
take
a
final
step
without
letting
you
know
what
it
is
here
prosper
bowed
twice
there
is
a
gentleman
of
fortune
going
out
to
the
united
states
on
a
mission
which
will
probably
occupy
him
for
three
or
four
years
i
am
not
exactly
warranted
in
mentioning
his
name
but
he
has
taken
in
hand
a
political
project
of
much
importance
again
prosper
bowed
now
he
has
offered
harry
the
place
of
private
secretary
on
condition
that
harry
will
undertake
to
stay
the
entire
term
he
is
to
have
a
salary
of
three
hundred
a
year
and
his
travelling
expenses
will
of
course
be
paid
for
him
if
he
goes
poor
boy
he
will
in
all
probability
remain
in
his
new
home
and
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
under
these
circumstances
i
have
thought
it
best
to
step
up
and
tell
you
in
a
friendly
manner
what
his
plans
are
then
he
had
told
his
tale
and
prosper
again
bowed
the
rector
had
been
very
crafty
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
wealthy
gentleman
with
the
american
project
and
the
salary
had
been
offered
but
in
other
respects
there
had
been
some
exaggeration
it
was
well
known
to
the
rector
that
prosper
regarded
america
and
all
her
institutions
with
a
religious
hatred
an
american
was
to
him
an
ignorant
impudent
fraudulent
creature
to
have
any
acquaintance
with
whom
was
a
disgrace
could
he
have
had
his
way
he
would
have
reconstituted
the
united
states
as
british
colonies
at
a
moment
notice
were
he
to
die
without
having
begotten
another
heir
buston
must
become
the
property
of
harry
annesley
and
it
would
be
dreadful
to
him
to
think
that
buston
should
be
owned
by
an
american
citizen
the
salary
offered
is
too
good
to
be
abandoned
said
annesley
when
he
saw
the
effect
which
his
story
had
produced
everything
is
going
against
me
exclaimed
prosper
well
i
will
not
talk
about
that
i
did
not
come
here
to
discuss
harry
or
his
sins
nor
for
the
matter
of
that
his
virtues
but
i
felt
it
would
be
improper
to
let
him
go
upon
his
journey
without
communicating
with
you
so
saying
he
took
his
departure
and
walked
back
to
the
rectory
chapter
xlv
a
determined
young
lady
when
this
offer
had
been
made
to
harry
annesley
he
found
it
to
be
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
write
a
farther
letter
to
florence
he
was
quite
aware
that
he
had
been
forbidden
to
write
he
had
written
one
letter
since
that
order
had
been
given
to
him
and
no
reply
had
come
to
him
he
had
not
expected
a
reply
but
still
her
silence
had
been
grievous
to
him
it
might
be
that
she
was
angry
with
him
really
angry
but
let
that
be
as
it
might
he
could
not
go
to
america
and
be
absent
for
so
long
a
period
without
telling
her
she
and
her
mother
were
still
at
brussels
when
january
came
mountjoy
had
gone
there
as
he
had
understood
for
a
month
and
was
still
at
the
embassy
when
three
months
had
passed
i
think
i
shall
stay
here
the
winter
mountjoy
had
said
to
sir
magnus
but
we
will
take
lodgings
i
see
that
very
nice
sets
of
apartments
are
to
be
let
but
sir
magnus
would
not
hear
of
this
he
said
and
said
truly
that
the
ministerial
house
was
large
and
at
last
he
declared
the
honest
truth
his
had
been
very
kind
to
him
about
money
and
had
said
not
a
word
on
that
troubled
subject
since
her
arrival
mountjoy
with
that
delicacy
which
still
belongs
to
some
english
ladies
would
have
suffered
extreme
poverty
rather
than
have
spoken
on
such
a
matter
in
truth
she
suffered
nothing
and
hardly
thought
about
it
but
sir
magnus
was
grateful
and
told
her
that
if
she
went
to
look
for
lodgings
he
should
go
to
the
lodgings
and
say
that
they
were
not
wanted
therefore
mountjoy
remained
where
she
was
entertaining
a
feeling
of
increased
toward
sir
magnus
life
went
on
rather
sadly
with
florence
anderson
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
pleaded
his
own
cause
no
farther
telling
both
sir
magnus
and
lady
mountjoy
of
the
pledge
he
had
made
he
did
in
fact
tell
two
or
three
other
persons
regarding
himself
as
a
martyr
to
chivalry
all
this
time
he
went
about
his
business
looking
very
wretched
but
though
he
did
not
speak
for
himself
he
could
not
hinder
others
from
speaking
for
him
sir
magnus
took
occasion
to
say
a
word
on
the
subject
once
daily
to
his
niece
her
mother
was
constant
in
her
attacks
but
lady
mountjoy
was
the
severest
of
the
three
and
was
accounted
by
florence
as
her
bitterest
enemy
the
words
which
passed
between
them
were
not
the
most
affectionate
in
the
world
lady
mountjoy
would
call
her
to
which
florence
would
reply
by
addressing
her
aunt
as
lady
why
do
you
call
me
lady
it
is
usual
in
common
conversation
why
do
you
call
me
if
you
cease
to
call
me
i
cease
to
call
you
lady
but
no
reverence
was
paid
by
the
girl
to
the
wife
of
the
british
minister
it
was
this
that
lady
mountjoy
specially
felt
as
she
complained
to
her
companion
miss
abbott
then
another
cause
for
trouble
sprang
up
during
the
winter
of
which
mention
must
be
made
farther
on
the
result
was
that
florence
was
instant
with
her
mother
to
take
her
back
to
england
we
will
return
however
to
harry
annesley
and
give
the
letter
verbatim
which
he
wrote
to
florence
dear
florence
i
wonder
whether
you
ever
think
of
me
or
ever
remember
that
i
exist
i
know
you
do
i
can
not
have
been
forgotten
like
that
and
you
yourself
are
the
truest
girl
that
ever
owned
to
loving
a
man
but
there
comes
a
chill
across
my
heart
when
i
think
how
long
it
is
since
i
wrote
to
you
and
that
i
have
not
had
a
line
even
to
acknowledge
my
letter
you
bade
me
not
to
write
and
you
have
not
even
forgiven
me
for
disobeying
your
order
i
can
not
but
get
stupid
ideas
into
my
mind
which
one
word
from
you
would
dissipate
now
however
i
must
write
again
order
or
no
order
between
a
man
and
a
woman
circumstanced
as
you
and
i
things
will
arise
which
make
it
incumbent
on
one
or
the
other
to
write
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
now
know
what
are
my
intentions
and
understand
the
reasons
which
have
actuated
me
i
have
found
myself
left
in
a
most
unfortunate
condition
by
my
uncle
folly
he
is
going
on
with
a
stupid
marriage
for
the
purpose
of
disinheriting
me
and
has
in
the
mean
time
stopped
the
allowance
which
he
had
made
me
since
i
left
college
of
course
i
have
no
absolute
claim
on
him
but
i
can
not
understand
how
he
can
reconcile
himself
to
do
so
when
he
himself
prevented
my
going
to
the
bar
saying
that
it
would
be
unnecessary
but
so
it
is
i
am
driven
to
look
about
for
myself
it
is
very
hard
at
my
time
of
life
to
find
an
opening
in
any
profession
i
think
i
told
you
before
that
i
had
ideas
of
going
to
cambridge
and
endeavoring
to
get
pupils
trusting
to
my
fellowship
rather
than
to
my
acquirements
but
this
i
have
always
looked
upon
with
great
dislike
and
would
only
have
taken
to
it
if
nothing
else
was
to
be
had
now
there
has
come
forward
an
old
college
acquaintance
a
man
who
is
three
or
four
years
my
senior
who
has
offered
to
take
me
to
america
as
his
private
secretary
he
proposes
to
remain
there
for
three
years
i
of
course
shall
not
bind
myself
to
stay
as
long
but
i
may
not
improbably
do
so
he
is
to
pay
my
expenses
and
to
give
me
a
salary
of
three
hundred
a
year
this
will
perhaps
lead
to
nothing
else
but
will
for
the
present
be
better
than
nothing
i
am
to
start
in
just
a
month
from
the
present
time
now
you
know
it
all
except
that
the
man
name
is
sir
william
crook
he
is
a
decent
sort
of
a
fellow
and
has
got
a
wife
who
is
to
go
with
him
he
is
the
hardest
working
man
i
know
but
between
you
and
me
will
never
set
the
thames
on
fire
if
the
thames
is
to
be
illumined
at
all
i
rather
think
that
i
shall
be
expected
to
do
it
now
my
own
one
what
am
i
to
say
about
you
and
of
myself
as
your
husband
that
is
to
be
will
you
wait
at
any
rate
for
three
years
with
the
conviction
that
the
three
years
will
too
probably
end
in
your
having
to
wait
again
i
do
feel
that
in
my
altered
position
i
ought
to
give
you
back
your
troth
and
tell
you
that
things
shall
be
as
they
used
to
be
before
that
happy
night
at
armitage
party
i
do
not
know
but
that
it
is
clearly
my
duty
i
almost
think
that
it
is
but
i
am
sure
of
this
that
it
is
the
one
thing
in
the
world
that
i
can
not
do
i
do
think
that
a
man
ought
to
be
asked
to
tear
himself
altogether
in
pieces
because
some
one
has
him
at
any
rate
i
can
not
if
you
say
that
it
must
be
so
you
shall
say
it
i
do
suppose
it
will
kill
me
but
it
will
go
a
long
way
in
writing
so
far
i
have
not
said
a
word
of
love
because
as
far
as
i
understand
you
that
is
a
subject
on
which
you
expect
me
to
be
silent
when
you
order
me
not
to
write
i
suppose
you
intend
that
i
am
to
write
no
this
therefore
you
will
take
simply
as
a
matter
of
business
and
as
such
i
suppose
you
will
acknowledge
it
in
this
way
i
shall
at
any
rate
see
your
handwriting
yours
affectionately
harry
annesley
harry
when
he
had
written
this
letter
considered
that
it
had
been
cold
calm
and
philosophical
he
could
not
go
to
america
for
three
years
without
telling
her
of
his
purpose
nor
could
he
mention
that
purpose
as
he
thought
in
any
language
less
glowing
but
florence
when
she
received
it
did
not
regard
it
in
the
same
light
to
her
thinking
the
letter
was
full
of
love
and
of
love
expressed
in
the
warmest
possible
language
sir
william
crook
she
said
to
herself
what
can
he
want
of
harry
in
america
for
three
years
i
am
sure
he
is
a
stupid
man
will
i
wait
of
course
i
will
wait
what
are
three
years
and
why
should
i
not
wait
but
for
the
matter
of
that
then
thoughts
came
into
her
mind
which
even
to
herself
she
could
not
express
in
words
sir
william
crook
had
got
a
wife
and
why
should
not
harry
take
a
wife
also
she
did
not
see
why
a
private
secretary
should
not
be
a
married
man
and
as
for
money
there
would
be
plenty
for
such
a
style
of
life
as
they
would
live
she
could
not
exactly
propose
this
but
she
thought
that
if
she
were
to
see
harry
just
for
one
short
interview
before
he
started
that
he
might
probably
then
propose
it
himself
things
be
as
they
used
to
be
she
exclaimed
to
herself
never
things
can
not
be
as
they
used
to
be
i
know
what
is
his
duty
it
is
his
duty
not
to
think
of
anything
of
the
kind
remember
that
he
exists
she
said
turning
back
to
the
earlier
words
of
the
letter
that
of
course
is
his
joke
i
wonder
whether
he
knows
that
every
moment
of
my
life
is
devoted
to
him
of
course
i
bade
him
not
to
write
but
i
can
tell
him
now
that
i
have
never
gone
to
bed
without
his
letter
beneath
my
pillow
this
and
much
more
of
the
same
kind
was
uttered
in
soliloquies
but
need
not
be
repeated
at
length
to
the
reader
but
she
had
to
think
what
steps
she
must
first
take
she
must
tell
her
mother
of
harry
intention
she
had
never
for
an
instant
allowed
her
mother
to
think
that
her
affection
had
dwindled
or
her
purpose
failed
her
she
was
engaged
to
marry
harry
annesley
and
marry
him
some
day
she
would
that
her
mother
should
be
sure
of
that
was
the
immediate
purpose
of
her
life
and
in
carrying
out
that
purpose
she
must
acquaint
her
mother
with
the
news
which
this
letter
had
brought
to
her
mamma
i
have
got
something
to
tell
you
well
my
dear
harry
annesley
is
going
to
america
there
was
something
pleasing
to
mountjoy
in
the
sound
of
these
words
if
harry
annesley
went
to
america
he
might
be
drowned
or
it
might
more
probably
be
that
he
would
never
come
back
america
was
to
her
imagination
a
long
way
off
lovers
did
not
go
to
america
except
with
the
intention
of
deserting
their
ladyloves
such
were
her
ideas
she
felt
at
the
moment
that
florence
would
be
more
easily
approached
in
reference
either
to
her
cousin
mountjoy
or
to
anderson
another
lover
had
sprung
up
too
in
brussels
of
whom
a
word
shall
be
said
if
her
harry
the
pernicious
harry
should
have
taken
himself
to
america
the
chances
of
all
these
three
gentlemen
would
be
improved
any
one
of
them
would
now
be
accepted
by
mountjoy
as
a
bar
fatal
to
harry
annesley
mountjoy
was
again
the
favorite
with
her
she
had
heard
that
he
had
returned
to
tretton
and
was
living
amicably
with
his
father
she
knew
even
of
the
income
allotted
to
him
for
the
present
of
the
six
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
had
told
florence
that
as
a
preliminary
income
it
was
more
than
double
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
which
had
been
taken
away
from
harry
taken
away
never
to
be
restored
there
was
not
much
in
this
argument
but
still
she
thought
well
to
use
it
the
captain
was
living
with
his
father
and
she
did
not
believe
a
word
about
the
entail
having
been
done
away
with
it
was
certain
that
harry
uncle
had
quarrelled
with
him
and
she
did
understand
that
a
baby
at
buston
would
altogether
rob
harry
of
his
chance
and
then
look
at
the
difference
in
the
properties
it
was
thus
that
she
argued
the
matter
but
in
truth
her
word
had
been
pledged
to
mountjoy
scarborough
and
mountjoy
scarborough
had
ever
been
a
favorite
with
her
though
she
could
talk
about
the
money
it
was
not
the
money
that
touched
her
feelings
well
he
may
go
to
america
it
is
a
dreadful
destiny
for
a
young
man
but
in
his
case
it
may
be
the
best
thing
that
he
can
do
of
course
he
intends
to
come
back
again
that
is
as
it
may
be
i
do
not
understand
what
you
mean
by
a
dreadful
destiny
mamma
i
see
that
it
is
a
destiny
at
all
he
is
getting
a
very
good
offer
for
a
year
or
two
and
thinks
it
best
to
take
it
i
might
go
with
him
for
that
matter
a
had
fallen
at
mountjoy
feet
florence
go
with
him
to
america
among
all
the
trials
which
had
come
upon
her
with
reference
to
this
young
man
there
had
been
nothing
so
bad
as
this
proposal
go
with
him
the
young
man
was
to
start
in
a
month
then
she
began
to
think
whether
it
would
be
within
her
power
to
stop
her
daughter
what
would
all
the
world
be
to
her
with
one
daughter
and
she
in
america
married
to
harry
annesley
her
quarrel
with
florence
was
not
at
all
as
was
the
quarrel
of
lady
mountjoy
lady
mountjoy
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
the
girl
whom
she
thought
to
be
impertinent
and
believed
to
be
false
but
to
her
mother
florence
was
the
very
apple
of
her
eye
it
was
because
she
thought
that
mountjoy
scarborough
was
a
grand
fellow
and
because
she
thought
all
manner
of
evil
of
harry
annesley
that
she
wished
florence
to
marry
her
cousin
and
to
separate
herself
forever
from
the
other
when
she
had
heard
that
harry
was
to
go
to
america
she
had
rejoiced
as
though
he
was
to
be
transported
to
botany
bay
her
ideas
were
but
when
it
was
hinted
that
florence
was
to
go
with
him
she
nearly
fell
to
the
ground
florence
certainly
had
behaved
badly
in
making
the
suggestion
she
had
not
intended
to
make
it
had
not
in
truth
thought
of
it
but
when
her
mother
talked
of
harry
destiny
as
though
some
terrible
evil
had
come
upon
him
as
though
she
were
speaking
of
a
poor
wretch
condemned
to
be
hanged
when
all
chances
of
a
reprieve
were
over
then
her
spirit
rose
within
her
she
had
not
meant
to
say
that
she
was
going
harry
had
never
asked
her
to
go
if
you
talk
of
his
destiny
i
am
quite
prepared
to
share
it
with
him
that
was
her
meaning
but
her
mother
already
saw
her
only
child
in
the
hands
of
those
american
savages
she
threw
herself
on
to
a
sofa
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
burst
into
tears
i
do
say
that
i
am
going
mamma
my
darling
my
dearest
my
child
only
that
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
except
that
it
would
not
suit
him
at
least
i
suppose
it
would
not
has
he
said
so
he
has
said
nothing
about
it
thank
heaven
for
that
he
does
not
intend
to
rob
me
of
my
child
but
mamma
i
am
to
be
his
wife
no
no
no
it
is
that
that
i
want
to
make
you
understand
you
know
nothing
of
his
character
nothing
i
do
know
that
he
told
a
base
falsehood
nothing
of
the
kind
i
will
not
admit
it
it
is
of
no
use
going
into
that
again
but
there
was
nothing
base
about
it
he
has
got
an
appointment
in
the
united
states
and
is
going
out
to
do
the
work
he
has
not
asked
me
to
go
with
him
the
two
things
would
probably
not
be
compatible
here
mountjoy
rose
from
the
sofa
and
embraced
her
child
as
though
liberated
from
her
deepest
grief
but
mamma
you
must
remember
this
that
i
have
given
him
my
word
and
will
never
be
induced
to
abandon
it
here
her
mother
threw
up
her
hands
and
again
began
to
weep
either
or
or
ten
years
hence
if
he
will
wait
as
long
i
will
we
shall
be
married
as
far
as
i
can
see
we
need
not
wait
ten
years
or
perhaps
more
than
one
or
two
my
money
will
suffice
for
us
he
proposes
to
live
upon
you
he
proposes
nothing
of
the
kind
he
is
going
to
america
because
he
will
not
propose
it
nor
am
i
proposing
it
just
at
present
at
any
rate
i
am
glad
of
that
and
now
mamma
you
must
take
me
back
home
as
soon
as
possible
when
he
has
started
no
mamma
i
must
be
there
before
he
starts
i
can
not
let
him
go
without
seeing
him
if
i
am
to
remain
here
here
he
must
come
your
uncle
would
never
receive
him
i
should
receive
him
this
was
dreadful
this
flying
into
actual
disobedience
whatever
did
she
mean
where
was
she
to
receive
him
how
could
you
receive
a
young
man
in
opposition
to
the
wishes
and
indeed
to
the
commands
of
all
your
friends
i
not
going
to
be
at
all
shamefaced
about
it
mamma
i
am
the
woman
he
has
selected
to
be
his
wife
and
he
is
the
man
i
have
selected
to
be
my
husband
if
he
were
coming
i
should
go
to
my
uncle
and
ask
to
have
him
received
think
of
your
aunt
yes
i
do
think
of
her
my
aunt
would
make
herself
very
disagreeable
upon
the
whole
mamma
i
think
it
would
be
best
that
you
should
take
me
back
to
england
there
is
this
grascour
here
who
is
a
great
trouble
and
you
may
be
sure
of
this
that
i
intend
to
see
harry
annesley
before
he
starts
for
america
so
the
interview
was
ended
but
mountjoy
was
left
greatly
in
doubt
as
to
what
she
might
best
do
she
felt
sure
that
were
annesley
to
come
to
brussels
florence
would
see
him
would
see
him
in
spite
of
all
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
anderson
and
grascour
could
do
to
prevent
it
that
reprobate
young
man
would
force
his
way
into
the
embassy
or
florence
would
force
her
way
out
in
either
case
there
would
be
a
terrible
scene
but
if
she
were
to
take
florence
back
to
cheltenham
interviews
to
any
extent
would
be
arranged
for
her
at
the
house
of
armitage
as
she
thought
of
all
this
the
idea
came
across
her
that
when
a
young
girl
is
determined
to
be
married
nothing
can
prevent
it
florence
in
the
mean
time
wrote
an
immediate
answer
to
her
lover
as
follows
dear
harry
of
course
you
were
entitled
to
write
when
there
was
something
to
be
said
which
it
was
necessary
that
i
should
know
when
you
have
simply
to
say
that
you
love
me
i
know
that
well
enough
without
any
farther
telling
go
to
america
for
three
years
it
is
very
very
serious
but
of
course
you
must
know
best
and
i
shall
not
attempt
to
interfere
what
are
three
years
to
you
and
me
if
we
were
rich
people
of
course
we
should
not
wait
but
as
we
are
poor
of
course
we
must
act
as
do
other
people
who
are
poor
i
have
about
four
hundred
a
year
and
it
is
for
you
to
say
how
far
that
may
be
sufficient
if
you
think
so
you
will
not
find
that
i
shall
want
more
but
there
is
one
thing
necessary
before
you
start
i
must
see
you
there
is
no
reason
on
earth
for
our
remaining
here
except
that
mamma
has
not
made
up
her
mind
if
she
will
consent
to
go
back
before
you
start
it
will
be
best
so
otherwise
you
must
take
the
trouble
to
come
here
where
i
am
afraid
you
will
not
be
received
as
a
welcome
guest
i
have
told
mamma
that
if
i
can
not
see
you
here
in
a
manner
that
is
becoming
i
shall
go
out
and
meet
you
in
the
streets
in
a
manner
that
is
unbecoming
your
affectionate
wife
that
is
to
be
florence
mountjoy
this
letter
she
took
to
her
mother
and
read
aloud
to
her
in
her
own
room
mountjoy
could
only
implore
that
it
might
not
be
sent
but
prevailed
not
at
all
there
is
not
a
word
in
it
about
love
said
florence
it
is
simply
a
matter
of
business
and
as
such
i
must
send
it
i
do
not
suppose
my
uncle
will
go
to
the
length
of
attempting
to
lock
me
up
he
would
i
think
find
it
difficult
to
do
so
there
was
a
look
in
florence
face
as
she
said
this
which
altogether
silenced
her
mother
she
did
not
think
that
sir
magnus
would
consent
to
lock
florence
up
and
she
did
think
that
were
he
to
attempt
to
do
so
he
would
find
the
task
very
difficult
chapter
xlvi
grascour
grascour
was
a
belgian
about
forty
years
old
who
looked
as
though
he
were
no
more
than
thirty
except
that
his
hair
was
in
patches
beginning
to
be
a
little
gray
he
was
in
the
government
service
of
his
country
well
educated
and
thoroughly
a
gentleman
as
is
the
case
with
many
belgians
he
would
have
been
taken
to
be
an
englishman
were
his
country
not
known
he
had
dressed
himself
in
english
mirrors
living
mostly
with
the
english
he
spoke
english
so
well
that
he
would
only
be
known
to
be
a
foreigner
by
the
correctness
of
his
language
he
was
a
man
of
singularly
good
temper
and
there
was
running
through
all
that
he
did
somewhat
of
a
chivalric
spirit
which
came
from
study
rather
than
nature
he
had
looked
into
things
and
seen
whether
they
were
good
or
at
any
rate
popular
and
endeavored
to
grasp
and
to
make
his
own
whatever
he
found
to
be
so
he
was
hitherto
unmarried
and
was
regarded
generally
by
his
friends
as
a
man
but
florence
mountjoy
was
powerful
over
him
and
he
set
to
work
to
make
her
his
wife
he
was
intimate
at
the
house
of
sir
magnus
and
saw
no
doubt
that
anderson
was
doing
the
same
thing
but
he
saw
also
that
anderson
did
not
succeed
he
had
told
himself
from
the
first
that
if
anderson
did
succeed
he
would
not
wish
to
do
so
the
girl
who
would
be
satisfied
with
anderson
would
hardly
content
him
he
remained
therefore
quiet
till
he
saw
that
anderson
had
failed
the
young
man
at
once
took
to
an
altered
mode
of
life
which
was
sufficiently
marked
he
went
like
sir
proteus
ungartered
everything
about
him
had
of
late
demonstrated
a
careless
desolation
all
this
grascour
observed
and
when
he
saw
it
he
felt
that
his
own
time
had
come
he
took
occasion
at
first
to
wait
upon
lady
mountjoy
he
believed
that
to
be
the
proper
way
of
going
to
work
he
was
very
intimate
with
the
mountjoys
and
was
aware
that
his
circumstances
were
known
to
them
there
was
no
reason
on
the
score
of
money
why
he
should
not
marry
the
niece
of
sir
magnus
he
had
already
shown
some
attention
to
florence
which
though
it
had
excited
no
suspicion
in
her
mind
had
been
seen
and
understood
by
her
aunt
and
it
had
been
understood
also
by
anderson
that
accursed
belgian
if
after
all
she
should
take
up
with
him
i
shall
tell
her
a
bit
of
my
mind
if
anything
of
that
kind
should
occur
my
niece
m
grascour
yes
my
lady
grascour
had
not
quite
got
over
the
way
of
calling
lady
mountjoy
my
lady
it
is
presumption
i
know
not
at
all
i
have
not
spoken
to
her
nor
would
i
do
so
till
i
had
first
addressed
myself
to
you
or
to
her
mother
may
i
speak
to
mrs
mountjoy
oh
certainly
i
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
the
young
lady
ideas
are
she
has
been
much
admired
here
and
elsewhere
and
that
may
have
turned
her
head
i
think
not
you
may
be
the
better
judge
m
grascour
i
think
that
miss
mountjoy
head
has
not
been
turned
by
any
admiration
she
does
not
appear
to
be
a
young
lady
whose
head
would
easily
be
turned
it
is
her
heart
of
which
i
am
thinking
the
interview
ended
by
lady
mountjoy
passing
the
belgian
lover
on
to
mountjoy
florence
said
mountjoy
yes
mountjoy
i
have
the
great
honor
of
asking
your
permission
i
am
well
known
to
sir
magnus
and
lady
mountjoy
and
they
can
tell
what
are
my
circumstances
i
am
forty
years
of
age
oh
yes
everything
is
i
am
sure
quite
as
it
should
be
but
my
daughter
thinks
about
these
things
for
herself
then
there
was
a
pause
and
grascour
was
about
to
leave
the
room
having
obtained
the
permission
he
desired
when
mountjoy
thought
it
well
to
acquaint
him
with
something
of
her
daughter
condition
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
my
daughter
has
been
engaged
indeed
yes
and
i
hardly
know
how
to
explain
the
circumstances
i
should
say
that
she
had
been
promised
to
her
cousin
captain
scarborough
but
to
this
she
will
not
give
her
assent
she
has
since
met
a
gentleman
annesley
for
whom
she
professes
an
attachment
neither
can
i
nor
can
her
uncle
and
aunt
hear
of
annesley
as
a
husband
for
florence
she
is
therefore
at
present
disengaged
if
you
can
gain
her
affections
you
have
my
leave
with
this
permission
grascour
departed
professing
himself
to
be
contented
he
did
not
see
florence
for
two
or
three
days
no
doubt
leaving
the
matter
to
be
discussed
with
her
by
her
mother
and
her
aunt
to
him
it
was
quite
indifferent
what
might
be
the
fate
of
captain
scarborough
or
of
annesley
or
indeed
of
anderson
and
to
tell
the
truth
he
was
not
under
any
violent
fear
or
hope
as
to
his
own
fate
he
admired
miss
mountjoy
and
thought
it
would
be
well
to
secure
for
a
wife
such
a
girl
with
such
a
fortune
as
would
belong
to
her
but
he
did
not
intend
to
go
ungartered
nor
yet
to
assume
an
air
of
desolation
if
she
would
come
to
him
it
would
be
well
if
she
would
not
why
it
would
still
be
well
the
only
outward
difference
made
by
his
love
was
that
he
brushed
his
clothes
and
his
hair
a
little
more
carefully
and
had
his
boots
brought
to
a
higher
state
of
polish
than
was
usual
her
mother
spoke
to
her
first
my
dear
grascour
is
a
most
excellent
man
i
am
sure
he
is
mamma
and
he
is
a
great
friend
to
your
uncle
and
lady
mountjoy
why
do
you
say
this
mamma
what
can
it
matter
to
me
my
dear
grascour
wishes
you
to
to
to
become
his
wife
oh
mamma
why
did
you
tell
him
that
it
is
impossible
how
was
i
to
know
my
dear
mamma
i
am
engaged
to
marry
harry
annesley
and
no
word
shall
ever
turn
me
from
that
purpose
unless
it
be
spoken
by
himself
the
crier
may
say
that
all
round
the
town
if
he
wishes
you
must
know
that
it
is
so
what
can
be
the
use
of
sending
grascour
or
any
other
gentleman
to
me
it
is
only
giving
me
pain
and
him
too
i
wish
mamma
you
could
be
got
to
understand
this
but
mountjoy
could
not
altogether
be
got
as
yet
to
understand
the
obstinacy
of
her
daughter
character
there
was
one
point
on
which
florence
received
information
from
these
two
suitors
who
had
come
to
her
at
brussels
they
were
both
favored
one
after
the
other
by
her
mother
and
would
not
have
been
so
favored
had
her
mother
absolutely
believed
in
captain
mountjoy
it
seemed
to
her
as
though
her
mother
would
be
willing
that
she
should
marry
any
one
so
long
as
it
was
not
harry
annesley
it
is
a
pity
that
there
should
be
such
a
difference
she
said
to
herself
but
we
will
see
what
firmness
can
do
then
lady
mountjoy
spoke
to
her
you
have
heard
of
grascour
my
dear
yes
i
have
heard
of
him
aunt
he
intends
to
do
you
the
honor
of
asking
you
to
be
his
wife
so
mamma
tells
me
i
have
only
to
say
that
he
is
a
man
most
highly
esteemed
here
he
is
well
known
at
the
court
and
is
at
the
royal
parties
should
you
become
his
wife
you
would
have
all
the
society
of
brussels
at
your
feet
all
the
society
of
brussels
would
do
no
good
perhaps
not
nor
the
court
and
the
royal
parties
if
you
choose
to
be
impertinent
when
i
tell
you
what
are
his
advantages
and
condition
in
life
i
can
not
help
it
i
do
not
mean
to
be
impertinent
what
you
say
about
the
royal
parties
and
the
court
is
intended
for
impertinence
knowing
as
you
do
know
your
uncle
position
not
at
all
you
know
my
position
i
am
engaged
to
marry
another
man
and
can
not
therefore
marry
grascour
why
should
he
be
sent
to
me
except
that
you
wo
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
i
am
engaged
then
she
marched
out
of
the
room
and
considered
within
her
own
bosom
what
answer
she
would
give
to
this
new
belgian
suitor
she
was
made
perfectly
aware
when
the
belgian
suitor
was
about
to
arrive
on
the
day
but
one
after
the
interview
with
her
aunt
she
was
left
alone
when
the
other
ladies
went
out
and
suspected
that
even
the
footmen
knew
what
was
to
happen
when
grascour
was
shown
into
the
there
was
a
simple
mode
of
dealing
with
the
matter
on
his
part
very
different
from
that
state
of
agitation
into
which
harry
had
been
thrown
when
he
had
made
his
proposition
she
was
quite
prepared
to
admit
that
grascour
plan
might
be
the
wisest
but
harry
manner
had
been
full
of
real
love
and
had
charmed
her
grascour
was
not
in
the
least
flustered
whereas
poor
harry
had
been
hardly
able
to
speak
his
mind
but
it
had
not
mattered
much
whether
harry
spoke
his
mind
or
not
whereas
all
the
eloquence
in
the
world
could
have
done
no
good
for
grascour
florence
had
known
that
harry
did
love
her
whereas
of
grascour
she
only
knew
that
he
wanted
to
make
her
his
wife
miss
mountjoy
he
said
i
am
charmed
to
find
you
here
allow
me
to
add
that
i
am
charmed
to
find
you
alone
florence
who
knew
all
about
it
only
bowed
she
had
to
go
through
it
and
thought
that
she
would
be
able
to
do
so
with
equanimity
i
do
not
know
whether
your
aunt
or
your
mother
have
done
me
the
honor
of
mentioning
my
name
to
you
they
have
both
spoken
to
me
i
thought
it
best
that
they
should
have
the
opportunity
of
doing
so
in
our
country
these
things
are
arranged
chiefly
by
the
lady
friends
with
your
people
i
know
it
is
different
perhaps
it
is
much
better
that
it
should
be
so
in
a
matter
in
which
the
heart
has
to
be
concerned
it
would
come
to
the
same
thing
with
me
i
must
decide
for
myself
i
am
sure
of
it
may
i
venture
to
feel
a
hope
that
ultimately
that
decision
may
not
go
against
me
grascour
as
he
said
this
did
throw
some
look
of
passion
into
his
face
but
i
have
spoken
nothing
as
yet
of
my
own
feelings
it
is
unnecessary
this
might
be
taken
in
either
one
of
two
senses
but
the
gentleman
was
not
sufficiently
vain
to
think
that
the
lady
had
intended
to
signify
to
him
that
she
would
accept
his
love
as
a
thing
of
which
she
could
have
no
doubt
ah
miss
mountjoy
he
continued
if
you
would
allow
me
to
say
that
since
you
have
been
at
brussels
not
a
day
has
passed
in
which
mingled
love
and
respect
have
not
grown
within
my
bosom
i
have
sat
by
and
watched
while
my
excellent
young
friend
anderson
has
endeavored
to
express
his
feelings
i
have
said
to
myself
that
i
would
bide
my
time
if
you
could
give
yourself
to
him
why
then
the
aspiration
should
be
quenched
within
my
own
breast
but
you
have
not
done
so
though
as
i
am
aware
he
has
been
assisted
by
my
friend
sir
magnus
i
have
seen
and
have
heard
and
have
said
to
myself
at
last
too
my
turn
may
come
i
have
loved
much
but
i
have
been
very
patient
can
it
be
that
my
turn
should
have
come
at
last
though
he
had
spoken
of
anderson
he
had
not
thought
it
expedient
to
say
a
word
either
of
captain
scarborough
or
of
annesley
he
knew
quite
as
much
of
them
as
he
did
of
anderson
he
was
clever
and
had
put
together
with
absolute
correctness
what
mountjoy
had
told
him
with
other
little
facts
which
had
reached
his
ears
grascour
i
suppose
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
i
ought
to
be
here
he
bowed
his
head
but
my
only
way
of
being
grateful
is
to
tell
you
the
truth
again
he
bowed
his
head
i
am
in
love
with
another
man
that
the
truth
here
he
shook
his
head
with
the
smallest
possible
shake
as
though
deprecating
her
love
but
not
doing
so
with
any
harshness
i
engaged
to
marry
him
too
there
was
another
shake
of
the
head
somewhat
more
powerful
and
i
intend
to
marry
him
this
she
said
with
much
bold
assurance
all
my
old
friends
know
that
it
is
so
and
ought
not
to
have
sent
you
to
me
i
have
given
a
promise
to
harry
annesley
and
harry
annesley
alone
can
make
me
depart
from
it
this
she
said
in
a
low
voice
but
almost
with
violence
because
there
had
come
another
shake
of
the
head
in
reply
to
her
assurance
that
she
meant
to
marry
annesley
and
though
he
were
to
make
me
depart
from
it
which
he
will
never
do
i
should
be
just
the
same
as
regards
anybody
else
you
understand
that
when
a
girl
has
given
herself
heart
and
soul
to
a
man
she
wo
change
girls
do
change
sometimes
you
may
know
them
i
do
not
girls
that
are
worth
anything
but
when
all
your
friends
are
hostile
what
can
they
do
they
ca
make
me
marry
another
person
they
may
hinder
my
happiness
but
they
ca
hand
me
over
like
a
parcel
of
goods
to
any
one
else
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
would
accept
such
a
parcel
oh
yes
such
a
parcel
you
would
accept
a
girl
who
would
come
to
you
telling
you
that
she
loved
another
man
i
do
believe
it
of
you
i
should
know
that
my
tenderness
would
beget
tenderness
in
you
it
would
do
anything
of
the
kind
it
would
be
all
horror
horror
i
should
kill
myself
or
else
you
or
perhaps
both
is
your
aversion
so
strong
no
not
at
all
not
at
present
i
like
you
very
much
i
do
indeed
do
anything
for
you
in
the
way
of
friendship
i
believe
you
to
be
a
real
gentleman
but
you
would
kill
me
you
make
me
talk
of
a
condition
of
things
which
is
quite
quite
impossible
when
i
say
that
i
like
you
i
am
talking
of
the
present
condition
of
things
i
have
not
the
least
desire
to
kill
you
or
myself
or
anybody
i
want
to
be
taken
back
to
england
and
there
to
be
allowed
to
marry
henry
annesley
that
what
i
want
but
i
intend
to
remain
engaged
to
him
that
my
purpose
and
no
man
and
no
woman
shall
stir
me
from
it
he
smiled
and
again
shook
his
head
and
she
began
to
doubt
whether
she
did
like
him
so
much
now
i
told
you
all
about
myself
she
said
rising
to
her
feet
you
may
believe
me
or
not
as
you
please
but
as
i
have
believed
you
i
have
told
you
all
then
she
walked
out
of
the
room
grascour
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
left
the
room
and
the
house
and
making
his
way
into
the
park
walked
round
it
twice
turning
in
his
mind
his
success
and
his
want
of
success
for
in
truth
he
was
not
at
all
dispirited
by
what
had
occurred
with
her
other
belgian
lover
that
is
with
anderson
florence
had
at
any
rate
succeeded
in
making
the
truth
appear
to
be
the
truth
he
did
believe
that
she
had
taken
such
a
fancy
to
that
fellow
harry
annesley
that
there
would
be
no
overcoming
it
he
had
got
a
glimpse
into
the
firmness
of
her
character
which
was
denied
to
grascour
grascour
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
shady
paths
of
the
park
told
himself
that
such
events
as
this
love
on
the
part
of
florence
were
very
common
in
the
lives
of
english
young
ladies
they
are
the
best
in
the
world
he
said
to
himself
and
they
make
the
most
charming
wives
but
their
education
is
such
that
there
is
no
preventing
these
accidents
the
passion
displayed
in
the
young
lady
words
he
attributed
solely
to
her
power
of
expression
one
girl
would
use
language
such
as
had
been
hers
and
such
a
girl
would
be
clever
eloquent
and
brave
another
girl
would
hum
and
haw
with
half
a
yes
and
a
quarter
of
a
no
and
would
mean
just
the
same
thing
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
she
had
engaged
herself
to
harry
annesley
nor
did
he
doubt
that
she
had
been
brought
to
brussels
to
break
off
that
engagement
and
he
thought
it
most
probable
that
her
friends
would
prevail
under
these
circumstances
why
should
he
despair
or
why
rather
as
he
was
a
man
not
given
to
despair
should
he
not
think
that
there
was
for
him
a
reasonable
chance
of
success
he
must
show
himself
to
be
devoted
true
and
not
easily
repressed
she
had
used
he
did
not
doubt
the
same
sort
of
language
in
silencing
anderson
anderson
had
accepted
her
words
but
he
knew
too
well
the
value
of
words
coming
from
a
young
lady
mouth
to
take
them
at
their
true
meaning
he
had
at
this
interview
affected
a
certain
amount
of
intimacy
with
florence
of
which
he
thought
that
he
appreciated
the
value
she
had
told
him
that
she
would
kill
him
of
course
in
joke
and
a
joke
from
a
girl
on
such
an
occasion
was
worth
much
no
belgian
girl
would
have
joked
but
then
he
was
anxious
to
marry
florence
because
florence
was
english
therefore
when
he
went
back
to
his
own
home
he
directed
that
the
system
of
the
high
polish
should
be
continued
with
his
boots
i
do
suppose
he
will
come
again
florence
had
said
to
her
mother
misunderstanding
the
character
of
her
latest
lover
quite
as
widely
as
he
misunderstood
hers
but
grascour
though
he
did
not
absolutely
renew
his
offer
at
once
gave
it
to
be
understood
that
he
did
not
at
all
withdraw
from
the
contest
he
obtained
permission
from
lady
mountjoy
to
be
constantly
at
the
embassy
and
succeeded
even
in
obtaining
a
promise
of
support
from
sir
magnus
you
quite
up
a
tree
sir
magnus
had
said
to
his
secretary
of
legation
it
clear
she
wo
look
at
you
i
have
pledged
myself
to
abstain
said
poor
anderson
in
a
tone
which
seemed
to
confess
that
all
chance
was
over
with
him
i
suppose
she
must
marry
some
one
and
i
do
see
why
grascour
should
not
have
as
good
a
chance
as
another
anderson
had
stalked
away
brooding
over
the
injustice
of
his
position
and
declaring
to
himself
that
this
belgian
should
never
be
allowed
to
marry
florence
mountjoy
in
peace
but
grascour
continued
his
attentions
and
this
it
was
which
had
induced
florence
to
tell
her
mother
that
the
belgian
was
a
great
trouble
which
ought
to
be
avoided
by
a
return
to
england
chapter
xlvii
florence
bids
farewell
to
her
lovers
mamma
had
you
not
better
take
me
back
to
cheltenham
at
once
has
that
unfortunate
young
man
written
to
you
yes
the
young
man
whom
you
call
unfortunate
has
written
of
course
i
can
not
agree
to
have
him
so
called
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
think
he
is
so
very
unfortunate
he
has
got
a
girl
who
really
loves
him
and
that
i
think
is
a
step
to
happiness
every
word
of
this
was
said
by
florence
as
though
with
the
purpose
of
provoking
her
mother
and
so
did
mountjoy
feel
it
but
behind
this
purpose
there
was
that
other
fixed
resolution
to
get
harry
at
last
accepted
as
her
husband
and
perhaps
the
means
taken
were
the
best
mrs
mountjoy
was
already
beginning
to
feel
that
there
would
be
nothing
for
her
but
to
give
up
the
battle
and
to
open
her
motherly
arms
to
harry
annesley
sir
magnus
had
told
her
that
grascour
would
probably
prevail
grascour
was
said
to
be
exactly
the
man
likely
to
be
effective
with
such
a
girl
as
florence
that
had
been
the
last
opinion
expressed
by
sir
magnus
but
mountjoy
had
found
no
comfort
in
it
florence
was
going
to
have
her
own
way
her
mother
knew
that
it
was
so
and
was
very
unhappy
but
she
was
still
anxious
to
continue
a
weak
ineffective
battle
it
was
very
impertinent
of
him
writing
she
said
when
he
was
going
to
america
for
years
dear
mamma
do
put
yourself
in
my
place
how
was
it
possible
that
he
should
not
write
a
young
man
has
no
business
to
come
and
insinuate
himself
into
a
family
in
that
way
and
then
when
he
knows
he
is
not
welcome
to
open
a
correspondence
but
mamma
he
knows
that
he
is
welcome
if
he
had
gone
to
america
without
writing
to
me
oh
it
would
have
been
impossible
i
should
have
gone
after
him
no
no
never
i
am
quite
in
earnest
mamma
but
it
is
no
good
talking
about
what
could
not
have
taken
place
we
ought
to
have
prevented
you
from
receiving
or
sending
letters
here
mountjoy
touched
on
a
subject
on
which
the
practice
of
the
english
world
has
been
much
altered
during
the
last
thirty
or
forty
years
perhaps
we
may
say
fifty
or
sixty
years
fifty
years
ago
young
ladies
were
certainly
not
allowed
to
receive
letters
as
they
chose
and
to
write
them
and
to
demand
that
this
practice
should
be
carried
on
without
any
supervision
from
their
elder
friends
it
is
now
usually
the
case
that
they
do
so
a
young
lady
before
she
falls
into
a
correspondence
with
a
young
man
is
expected
to
let
it
be
understood
that
she
does
so
but
she
does
not
expect
that
his
letters
either
coming
or
going
shall
be
subject
to
any
espial
and
she
generally
feels
that
the
option
of
obeying
or
disobeying
the
instructions
given
to
her
rests
with
herself
practically
the
use
of
the
is
in
her
own
hands
and
as
this
spirit
of
has
grown
up
the
morals
and
habits
of
our
young
ladies
have
certainly
not
deteriorated
in
america
they
carry
and
walk
about
with
young
gentlemen
as
young
gentlemen
walk
about
with
each
other
in
america
the
young
ladies
are
as
as
with
us
as
as
they
are
in
some
continental
countries
in
which
they
are
still
watched
close
till
they
are
given
up
as
brides
to
husbands
with
whom
they
have
had
no
means
of
becoming
acquainted
whether
the
system
or
that
of
free
correspondence
may
not
rob
the
flowers
of
some
of
that
delicate
aroma
which
we
used
to
appreciate
may
be
a
question
but
then
it
is
also
a
question
whether
there
does
not
come
something
in
place
of
it
which
in
the
is
found
to
be
more
valuable
florence
when
this
remark
was
made
as
to
her
own
power
of
sending
and
receiving
letters
remained
silent
but
looked
very
firm
she
thought
that
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
silence
her
after
this
fashion
sir
magnus
could
have
done
it
at
any
rate
if
i
had
not
been
able
sir
magnus
could
have
done
nothing
i
think
which
would
not
have
been
within
your
power
but
it
is
useless
talking
of
this
will
you
not
take
me
back
to
england
so
as
to
prevent
the
necessity
of
harry
coming
here
why
should
he
come
because
mamma
i
intend
to
see
my
future
husband
before
he
goes
from
me
for
so
great
a
distance
and
for
so
long
a
time
do
you
feel
any
pity
for
me
mamma
do
you
feel
pity
for
me
because
one
day
you
wish
me
to
marry
my
cousin
scarborough
and
the
next
anderson
and
then
the
next
grascour
how
can
i
pity
you
for
that
it
is
all
done
because
you
have
taken
it
in
your
head
to
think
ill
of
one
whom
i
believe
to
be
especially
worthy
you
began
by
disliking
him
because
he
interfered
with
your
plans
about
mountjoy
i
never
would
have
married
my
cousin
mountjoy
he
is
not
to
my
taste
and
he
is
a
gambler
but
you
have
thought
that
you
could
do
what
you
liked
with
me
it
has
always
been
for
your
own
happiness
but
i
must
be
the
judge
of
that
how
could
i
be
happy
with
any
of
these
men
seeing
that
i
do
not
care
for
them
in
the
least
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
for
me
to
have
myself
married
to
either
of
them
to
harry
annesley
i
have
given
myself
altogether
but
you
because
you
are
my
mother
are
able
to
keep
us
apart
do
you
not
pity
me
for
the
sorrow
and
trouble
which
i
must
suffer
i
suppose
a
mother
always
pities
the
sufferings
of
a
child
and
removes
them
when
she
can
do
so
but
now
mamma
is
he
to
come
here
or
will
you
take
me
back
to
england
this
was
a
question
which
mountjoy
found
it
very
difficult
to
answer
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
she
could
not
answer
it
as
it
would
be
necessary
that
she
should
first
consult
sir
magnus
could
sir
magnus
undertake
to
confine
her
daughter
within
the
precincts
of
the
embassy
and
to
exclude
the
lover
during
such
time
as
harry
annesley
night
remain
in
brussels
as
she
thought
of
the
matter
in
her
own
room
she
conceived
that
there
would
be
a
great
difficulty
all
the
world
of
brussels
would
become
aware
of
what
was
going
on
the
young
lady
would
endeavor
to
get
out
and
could
only
be
constrained
by
the
of
the
servants
and
the
young
gentleman
in
his
endeavors
to
get
in
could
only
be
prevented
by
the
assistance
of
the
police
dim
ideas
presented
themselves
to
her
mind
of
farther
travel
but
wherever
she
went
there
would
be
a
and
she
was
aware
that
the
young
man
could
pursue
her
much
quicker
than
she
could
fly
how
good
it
would
be
that
in
such
an
emergency
she
might
have
the
privilege
of
locking
her
daughter
up
in
some
convent
and
yet
it
must
be
a
protestant
convent
as
all
things
savoring
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
were
abhorrent
to
her
altogether
as
she
thought
of
her
own
condition
and
that
of
her
daughter
she
felt
that
the
world
was
sadly
out
of
joint
coming
here
is
he
said
sir
magnus
then
he
will
just
have
to
go
back
again
as
wise
as
he
came
but
can
you
shut
your
doors
against
him
shut
my
doors
of
course
i
can
he
never
be
able
to
get
his
nose
in
here
if
once
an
order
has
been
given
for
his
exclusion
who
annesley
i
do
suppose
he
knows
an
englishman
in
brussels
but
she
will
go
out
to
meet
him
what
in
the
streets
said
sir
magnus
in
horror
i
fear
she
would
by
george
she
must
be
a
one
if
she
do
that
then
mountjoy
with
tears
in
her
eyes
began
to
explain
with
very
many
epithets
that
her
daughter
was
the
best
girl
in
all
the
world
she
was
entirely
worthy
of
confidence
those
who
knew
her
were
aware
that
no
better
behaved
young
woman
could
exist
she
was
conscientious
religious
and
but
she
go
out
in
the
streets
and
walk
with
a
young
man
when
all
her
friends
tell
her
not
is
that
her
idea
of
religion
then
mountjoy
with
some
touch
of
anger
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
said
that
she
would
return
to
england
and
carry
her
daughter
with
her
what
the
deuce
can
i
do
sarah
when
the
young
lady
is
so
unruly
i
can
give
orders
to
have
him
shut
out
and
can
take
care
that
they
are
obeyed
but
i
can
not
give
orders
to
have
her
shut
in
i
should
be
making
her
a
prisoner
and
everybody
would
talk
about
it
in
that
matter
you
must
give
her
the
orders
only
you
say
that
she
would
not
comply
with
them
on
the
following
day
mountjoy
informed
her
daughter
that
they
would
go
back
to
cheltenham
she
did
not
name
an
immediate
day
because
it
would
be
well
she
thought
to
stave
off
the
evil
hour
nor
did
she
name
a
distant
day
because
were
she
to
do
so
the
terrible
evil
of
harry
annesley
arrival
in
brussels
would
not
be
prevented
at
first
she
wished
to
name
no
day
thinking
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
cross
harry
on
the
road
but
here
florence
was
too
strong
for
her
and
at
last
a
day
was
fixed
in
a
week
time
they
would
take
their
departure
and
go
home
by
slow
stages
with
this
arrangement
florence
expressed
herself
well
pleased
and
of
course
made
harry
acquainted
with
the
probable
time
of
their
arrival
grascour
when
he
heard
that
the
day
had
been
suddenly
fixed
for
the
departure
of
mountjoy
and
her
daughter
not
unnaturally
conceived
that
he
himself
was
the
cause
of
the
ladies
departure
nor
did
he
on
that
account
resign
all
hope
the
young
lady
mother
was
certainly
on
his
side
and
he
thought
it
quite
possible
that
were
he
to
appear
in
england
he
might
be
successful
but
when
he
had
heard
of
her
coming
departure
of
course
it
was
necessary
that
he
should
say
some
special
farewell
he
dined
one
evening
at
the
british
embassy
and
took
an
opportunity
during
the
evening
of
finding
himself
alone
with
florence
and
so
miss
florence
he
said
you
and
your
estimable
mamma
are
about
to
return
to
england
we
have
been
here
a
very
long
time
and
are
going
home
at
last
it
seems
to
me
but
the
other
day
when
you
came
said
grascour
with
all
a
lover
eagerness
it
was
in
autumn
and
the
weather
was
quite
mild
and
soft
now
we
are
in
the
middle
of
january
i
suppose
so
but
still
the
time
has
gone
only
too
rapidly
the
heart
can
hardly
take
account
of
days
and
weeks
as
this
was
decidedly
lover
talk
and
was
made
in
terms
which
even
a
young
lady
can
not
pretend
to
misunderstand
florence
was
obliged
to
answer
it
in
some
manner
equally
direct
and
now
she
was
angry
with
him
she
had
informed
him
that
she
was
in
love
with
another
man
in
doing
so
she
had
done
much
more
than
the
necessity
of
the
case
demanded
and
had
told
him
as
the
best
way
of
silencing
him
that
which
she
might
have
been
expected
to
keep
as
her
own
secret
and
yet
here
he
was
talking
to
her
about
his
heart
she
made
him
no
immediate
answer
but
frowned
at
him
and
looked
stern
it
was
clear
to
her
intelligence
that
he
had
no
right
to
talk
to
her
about
his
heart
after
the
information
she
had
given
him
i
hope
miss
mountjoy
that
i
may
look
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
when
i
go
over
to
england
but
we
do
live
in
london
or
near
it
we
live
down
in
the
country
at
cheltenham
distance
would
be
nothing
this
was
very
bad
and
must
be
stopped
thought
florence
i
suppose
i
shall
be
married
by
that
time
i
do
know
where
we
may
live
but
i
shall
be
happy
to
see
you
if
you
call
she
had
here
made
a
bold
assertion
and
one
which
grascour
did
not
at
all
believe
he
was
speaking
of
a
visit
which
he
might
make
perhaps
in
a
month
or
six
weeks
and
the
young
lady
told
him
that
he
would
find
her
married
and
yet
as
he
knew
very
well
her
mother
and
her
uncle
and
her
aunt
were
all
opposed
to
this
marriage
and
she
spoke
of
it
without
a
blush
without
any
reticence
young
ladies
were
much
emancipated
but
he
did
not
think
that
they
generally
carried
their
emancipation
so
far
as
this
i
hope
not
that
he
said
i
do
know
why
you
should
be
so
as
to
hope
it
the
fact
is
grascour
you
do
believe
what
i
told
you
the
other
day
perhaps
as
a
young
lady
i
ought
not
to
have
alluded
to
it
but
i
did
so
in
order
to
set
the
matter
at
rest
altogether
of
course
i
ca
tell
when
you
may
come
if
you
come
quite
at
once
i
shall
not
be
married
no
not
married
but
i
shall
be
as
much
engaged
as
is
possible
for
a
girl
to
be
i
have
given
my
word
and
nothing
will
make
me
false
to
it
i
do
suppose
you
will
come
on
my
account
solely
on
your
account
then
stay
at
home
i
am
quite
in
earnest
and
now
i
must
say
she
departed
and
left
him
seated
alone
on
the
sofa
he
at
first
told
himself
that
she
was
unfeminine
there
was
a
hard
way
with
her
of
talking
about
herself
which
he
almost
pronounced
to
be
unladylike
an
unmarried
girl
should
he
thought
under
no
circumstances
speak
of
the
gentleman
to
whom
her
affections
had
been
given
as
miss
mountjoy
spoke
of
annesley
but
nevertheless
he
would
sooner
possess
her
as
his
own
wife
than
any
other
girl
he
had
ever
met
something
of
the
real
passion
of
unsatisfied
love
made
him
feel
chill
at
his
heart
who
was
this
harry
annesley
for
whom
she
professed
so
warm
a
feeling
her
mother
declared
harry
annesley
to
be
a
scapegrace
and
something
of
the
story
of
a
discreditable
midnight
street
quarrel
between
him
and
the
young
cousin
had
reached
his
ears
he
did
not
suppose
it
to
be
possible
that
the
young
lady
could
actually
get
married
without
her
and
therefore
he
thought
that
he
still
would
go
to
england
in
one
respect
he
was
altogether
untouched
if
he
could
ultimately
succeed
in
marrying
the
young
lady
she
would
not
be
a
bit
the
worse
as
his
wife
because
she
had
been
attached
to
harry
annesley
that
was
a
kind
of
folly
which
a
girl
could
very
quickly
get
over
when
she
had
not
been
allowed
to
have
her
own
way
therefore
upon
the
whole
he
thought
that
he
would
go
to
england
but
the
parting
with
anderson
had
also
to
be
endured
and
must
necessarily
be
more
difficult
she
owed
him
a
debt
for
having
abstained
and
she
could
not
go
without
paying
the
debt
by
some
expression
of
gratitude
that
she
would
have
done
so
had
he
kept
aloof
was
a
matter
of
course
but
equally
a
matter
of
course
was
it
that
he
would
not
keep
aloof
i
shall
want
to
see
you
for
just
five
minutes
morning
before
you
take
your
departure
he
said
in
a
lugubrious
voice
during
her
last
evening
he
had
kept
his
promise
to
the
very
letter
mooning
about
in
his
desolate
manner
very
conspicuously
the
desolation
had
been
notorious
and
very
painful
to
florence
but
the
promise
had
been
kept
and
she
was
grateful
oh
certainly
if
you
wish
it
she
said
i
do
wish
it
then
he
made
an
appointment
and
she
promised
to
keep
it
it
was
in
the
a
huge
chamber
very
convenient
for
its
intended
purpose
and
always
handsome
at
but
looking
as
desolate
in
the
morning
as
did
poor
anderson
himself
he
was
stalking
up
and
down
the
long
room
when
she
entered
it
and
being
at
the
farther
end
stalked
up
to
her
and
addressed
her
with
words
which
he
had
chosen
for
the
purpose
miss
mountjoy
he
said
you
found
me
here
a
happy
young
man
i
hope
i
leave
you
soon
to
be
the
same
in
spite
of
this
little
accident
he
did
not
say
that
he
was
a
blighted
being
because
the
word
had
he
thought
become
ridiculous
but
he
would
have
used
it
had
he
dared
as
expressing
most
accurately
his
condition
a
cloud
has
passed
over
me
and
its
darkness
will
never
be
effaced
it
has
certainly
been
your
doing
oh
anderson
what
can
i
say
i
have
loved
before
but
never
like
this
and
so
you
will
again
never
when
i
declare
that
i
expect
my
word
to
be
respected
he
paused
for
an
answer
but
what
could
she
say
she
did
not
at
all
respect
his
word
on
such
a
subject
but
she
did
respect
his
conduct
yes
i
call
upon
you
to
believe
me
when
i
say
that
for
me
all
that
is
over
but
it
can
be
nothing
to
you
it
will
be
very
much
to
me
i
shall
go
on
in
the
same
disconsolate
miserable
way
i
suppose
i
shall
stay
here
because
i
shall
be
as
well
here
as
anywhere
else
i
might
move
to
lisbon
but
what
good
would
that
do
me
your
image
would
follow
me
to
whatever
capital
i
might
direct
my
steps
but
there
is
one
thing
you
can
do
here
he
brightened
up
putting
on
quite
an
altered
face
i
will
do
anything
anderson
in
my
power
if
if
if
you
should
change
i
shall
never
change
she
said
with
an
angry
look
if
you
should
change
i
think
you
should
remember
the
promise
you
exacted
and
the
fidelity
with
which
it
has
been
kept
i
do
remember
it
and
then
i
should
be
allowed
to
come
again
and
have
my
chance
wherever
i
may
be
at
the
court
of
the
shah
of
persia
or
at
the
chinese
capital
i
will
instantly
come
i
promised
you
when
you
asked
me
will
you
not
now
promise
me
i
can
not
promise
anything
so
impossible
it
will
bind
you
to
nothing
but
to
let
me
know
that
annesley
has
gone
his
way
but
she
had
to
explain
to
him
that
it
was
impossible
she
should
make
any
promise
founded
on
the
idea
that
henry
annesley
should
ever
go
any
way
in
which
she
would
not
accompany
him
with
that
he
had
to
be
as
well
satisfied
as
the
circumstances
of
the
case
would
admit
and
he
left
her
with
an
assurance
not
intended
to
be
quite
audible
that
he
was
and
ever
should
be
a
blighted
individual
when
the
carriage
was
at
the
door
sir
magnus
came
down
into
the
hall
full
of
smiles
and
but
at
that
moment
lady
mountjoy
was
saying
a
last
word
of
farewell
to
her
relatives
in
her
own
chamber
my
dear
i
hope
you
will
get
well
through
all
your
troubles
this
was
addressed
to
mountjoy
and
as
for
you
my
dear
she
said
turning
to
florence
if
you
would
only
contrive
to
be
a
little
less
i
think
the
world
would
go
easier
with
you
i
think
my
stiff
neck
aunt
as
you
call
it
is
what
i
have
chiefly
to
depend
upon
i
mean
in
reference
to
other
advice
than
mamma
aunt
florence
and
the
two
parted
hating
each
other
as
only
female
enemies
can
hate
but
florence
when
she
was
in
the
carriage
threw
herself
on
to
her
mother
neck
and
kissed
her
chapter
xlviii
prosper
changes
his
mind
when
florence
with
her
mother
reached
cheltenham
she
found
a
letter
lying
for
her
which
surprised
her
much
the
the
letter
was
from
harry
and
seemed
to
have
been
written
in
better
spirits
than
he
had
lately
displayed
but
it
was
very
short
dearest
florence
when
can
i
come
down
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
you
all
my
plans
are
likely
to
be
changed
in
the
most
extraordinary
manner
nobody
can
say
that
this
is
a
yours
affectionately
h
a
florence
of
course
showed
the
letter
to
her
mother
who
was
much
frightened
by
its
contents
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
when
he
comes
she
exclaimed
if
you
will
be
so
very
very
good
as
to
see
him
you
must
not
say
anything
unkind
unkind
how
can
i
say
anything
else
than
what
you
would
call
unkind
i
disapprove
of
him
altogether
and
he
is
coming
here
with
the
express
object
of
taking
you
away
from
me
oh
no
not
at
once
but
at
some
day
which
i
trust
may
be
very
distant
how
can
i
speak
to
him
kindly
when
i
feel
that
he
is
my
enemy
but
the
matter
was
at
last
set
at
rest
by
a
promise
from
florence
that
she
would
not
marry
her
lover
in
less
than
three
years
without
her
mother
express
consent
three
years
is
a
long
time
was
mountjoy
thought
and
many
things
might
occur
within
that
term
harry
of
whom
she
thought
all
manner
of
unnatural
things
might
probably
in
that
time
have
proved
himself
to
be
utterly
unworthy
and
mountjoy
scarborough
might
again
have
come
forward
in
the
light
of
the
world
she
had
heard
of
late
that
mountjoy
had
been
received
once
more
into
his
father
full
favor
and
the
old
man
had
become
so
enormously
rich
through
the
building
of
mills
which
had
been
going
on
at
tretton
that
as
mountjoy
thought
he
would
be
able
to
make
any
number
of
elder
sons
on
the
subject
of
entail
her
ideas
were
misty
but
she
felt
sure
that
mountjoy
scarborough
would
even
yet
become
a
rich
man
that
florence
should
be
made
to
change
on
that
account
she
did
not
expect
but
she
did
think
that
when
she
should
have
learned
that
harry
was
a
murderer
or
a
midnight
thief
or
a
wicked
conspirator
she
would
give
him
up
therefore
she
agreed
to
receive
him
with
not
actually
expressed
hostility
when
he
should
call
at
montpelier
place
but
now
in
the
proper
telling
of
our
story
we
must
go
back
to
harry
annesley
himself
it
will
be
remembered
that
his
father
had
called
upon
prosper
to
inform
him
of
harry
projected
journey
to
america
that
mountjoy
scarborough
had
also
called
at
buston
hall
and
that
previous
to
these
two
visits
old
scarborough
had
himself
written
a
long
letter
giving
a
detailed
account
of
the
conflict
which
had
taken
place
in
the
london
streets
these
three
events
had
operated
strongly
on
prosper
mind
but
not
so
strongly
as
the
conduct
of
miss
thoroughbung
and
soames
simpson
it
had
been
made
evident
to
him
from
the
joint
usage
which
he
had
received
from
these
persons
that
he
was
simply
made
use
of
with
the
object
of
obtaining
from
him
the
best
possible
establishment
for
the
lady
in
question
after
that
interview
at
which
the
lady
having
obtained
in
way
of
jointure
much
more
than
was
due
to
her
demanded
also
for
miss
tickle
a
home
and
for
herself
a
pair
of
ponies
he
received
a
farther
letter
from
the
lawyers
this
offended
him
greatly
nothing
on
earth
should
induce
him
to
write
a
line
to
soames
simpson
nor
did
he
see
his
way
to
writing
again
to
grey
barry
about
such
trifles
as
those
contained
in
the
letter
from
the
buntingford
lawyers
trifles
to
him
they
were
not
but
trifles
they
must
become
if
put
into
a
letter
addressed
to
a
london
firm
our
client
is
anxious
to
know
specifically
that
she
is
to
be
allowed
to
bring
miss
tickle
with
her
when
she
removes
to
buston
hall
her
happiness
depends
greatly
on
the
company
of
miss
tickle
to
which
she
had
been
used
now
for
many
years
our
client
wishes
to
be
assured
also
that
she
shall
be
allowed
to
keep
a
pair
of
ponies
in
addition
to
the
which
will
be
maintained
no
doubt
chiefly
for
your
own
purposes
these
were
the
demands
as
made
by
soames
simpson
and
felt
by
prosper
to
be
altogether
impossible
he
recollected
the
passionate
explosion
of
wrath
to
which
the
name
of
miss
tickle
had
already
brought
him
in
presence
of
the
clergyman
of
his
parish
he
would
endure
no
farther
disgrace
on
behalf
of
miss
tickle
miss
tickle
should
never
be
an
inmate
of
his
house
and
as
for
the
ponies
no
pony
should
ever
be
stabled
in
his
stalls
a
pony
was
an
animal
which
of
its
very
nature
was
objectionable
to
him
there
was
a
want
of
dignity
in
a
pony
to
which
buston
hall
should
never
be
subjected
and
also
he
said
to
himself
at
last
there
is
a
lack
of
dignity
about
miss
thoroughbung
herself
which
would
do
me
an
irreparable
injury
but
how
should
he
make
known
his
decision
to
the
lady
herself
and
how
should
he
escape
from
the
marriage
in
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
no
stain
on
his
character
as
a
gentleman
if
he
could
have
offered
her
a
sum
of
money
he
would
have
done
so
at
once
but
that
he
thought
would
not
be
and
would
be
a
confession
on
his
own
part
that
he
had
behaved
wrongly
at
last
he
determined
to
take
no
notice
of
the
lawyers
letter
and
himself
to
write
to
miss
thoroughbung
telling
her
that
the
objects
which
they
proposed
to
themselves
by
marriage
were
not
compatible
and
that
therefore
their
matrimonial
intentions
must
be
allowed
to
subside
he
thought
it
well
over
and
felt
assured
that
very
much
of
the
success
of
such
a
measure
must
depend
upon
the
wording
of
the
letter
there
need
be
no
immediate
haste
miss
thoroughbung
would
not
come
to
buston
again
quite
at
once
to
disturb
him
by
a
farther
visit
before
she
would
come
he
would
have
flown
to
italy
the
letter
must
be
courteous
and
somewhat
tender
but
it
must
be
absolutely
decisive
there
must
be
no
left
by
which
she
could
again
entangle
him
no
crevice
by
which
she
could
creep
into
buston
the
letter
should
be
a
work
of
time
he
would
give
himself
a
week
or
ten
days
for
composing
it
and
then
when
it
should
have
been
sent
he
would
be
off
to
italy
but
before
he
could
allow
himself
to
go
upon
his
travels
he
must
settle
the
question
about
his
nephew
which
now
lay
heavy
upon
his
conscience
he
did
feel
that
he
had
ill
treated
the
young
man
he
had
been
so
told
in
very
strong
language
by
scarborough
of
tretton
and
scarborough
of
tretton
was
a
man
of
very
large
property
and
much
talked
about
in
the
world
very
wonderful
things
were
said
about
scarborough
but
they
all
tended
to
make
prosper
believe
that
he
was
a
man
of
distinction
and
he
had
also
heard
lately
about
scarborough
younger
son
or
indeed
his
only
son
according
to
the
new
way
of
speaking
of
him
tidings
which
were
not
much
in
that
young
man
favor
it
was
from
augustus
scarborough
that
he
had
heard
those
evil
stories
about
his
own
nephew
therefore
his
belief
was
shaken
and
it
was
by
no
means
clear
to
him
that
there
could
be
any
other
heir
for
their
property
miss
thoroughbung
had
proved
herself
to
be
altogether
unfit
for
the
high
honor
he
had
intended
her
miss
puffle
had
gone
off
with
farmer
tazlehurst
son
prosper
did
not
think
that
he
had
energy
enough
to
look
for
a
third
lady
who
might
be
fit
at
all
points
to
become
his
wife
and
now
another
evil
had
been
added
to
all
these
his
nephew
had
declared
his
purpose
of
emigrating
to
the
united
states
and
becoming
an
american
it
might
be
true
that
he
should
be
driven
to
do
so
by
absolute
want
he
prosper
had
stopped
his
allowance
and
had
done
so
after
deterring
him
from
following
any
profession
by
which
he
might
have
earned
his
bread
he
had
looked
into
the
law
and
as
far
as
he
could
understand
it
buston
must
become
the
property
of
his
nephew
even
though
his
nephew
should
become
an
american
citizen
his
conscience
pricked
him
sorely
as
he
thought
of
the
evil
which
might
thus
accrue
and
of
the
disgrace
which
would
be
attached
to
his
own
name
he
therefore
wrote
the
following
letter
to
his
nephew
and
sent
it
across
to
the
parsonage
done
up
in
a
large
envelope
and
sealed
carefully
with
the
buston
arms
and
on
the
corner
of
the
envelope
peter
prosper
was
written
very
legibly
my
dear
nephew
henry
annesley
under
existing
circumstances
you
will
i
think
be
surprised
at
a
letter
written
in
my
handwriting
but
facts
have
arisen
which
make
it
expedient
that
i
should
address
you
you
are
about
i
am
informed
to
proceed
to
the
united
states
a
country
against
which
i
acknowledge
i
entertain
a
serious
antipathy
they
are
not
a
gentlemanlike
people
and
i
am
given
to
understand
that
they
are
generally
dishonest
in
all
their
dealings
their
president
is
a
low
person
and
all
their
ideas
of
government
are
pettifogging
their
ladies
i
am
told
are
very
vulgar
though
i
have
never
had
the
pleasure
of
knowing
one
of
them
they
are
an
irreligious
nation
and
have
no
respect
for
the
established
church
of
england
and
her
bishops
i
should
be
very
sorry
that
my
heir
should
go
among
them
with
reference
to
my
stopping
the
income
which
i
have
hitherto
allowed
you
it
was
a
step
i
took
upon
the
best
advice
nor
can
i
allow
it
to
be
thought
that
there
is
any
legal
claim
upon
me
for
a
continuance
of
the
payment
but
i
am
willing
for
the
present
to
continue
it
on
the
full
understanding
that
you
at
once
give
up
your
american
project
but
there
is
a
subject
on
which
it
is
essentially
necessary
that
i
should
receive
from
you
as
my
heir
a
full
and
complete
explanation
under
what
circumstances
did
you
beat
captain
scarborough
in
the
streets
late
on
the
night
of
the
of
june
last
and
how
did
it
come
to
pass
that
you
left
him
bleeding
speechless
and
motionless
on
that
occasion
as
i
am
about
to
continue
the
payment
of
the
sum
hitherto
allowed
i
think
it
only
fitting
that
i
should
receive
this
explanation
under
your
own
i
am
your
affectionate
uncle
peter
prosper
a
rumor
may
probably
have
reached
you
of
a
projected
alliance
between
me
and
a
young
lady
belonging
to
a
family
with
which
your
sister
is
about
to
connect
herself
it
is
right
that
i
should
tell
you
that
there
is
no
truth
in
this
report
this
letter
which
was
much
easier
to
write
than
the
one
intended
for
miss
thoroughbung
was
unfortunately
sent
off
a
little
before
the
completion
of
the
other
a
day
interval
had
been
intended
but
the
missive
to
miss
thoroughbung
was
under
the
press
of
difficulties
delayed
longer
than
was
intended
there
was
we
grieve
to
say
much
of
joy
but
more
of
laughter
at
the
rectory
when
this
letter
was
received
as
usual
joe
thoroughbung
was
there
and
it
was
found
impossible
to
keep
the
letter
from
him
the
postscript
burst
upon
them
all
as
a
surprise
and
was
welcomed
by
no
one
with
more
vociferous
joy
than
by
the
lady
nephew
so
there
is
an
end
forever
to
the
hope
that
a
child
of
the
buntingford
brewery
should
sit
upon
the
throne
of
the
prospers
it
was
thus
that
joe
expressed
himself
why
should
he
have
sat
there
said
polly
a
thoroughbung
is
as
good
as
a
prosper
any
day
but
this
was
not
said
in
the
presence
of
annesley
who
on
that
subject
entertained
views
very
different
from
her
daughter
i
wonder
what
his
idea
is
of
the
church
of
england
said
annesley
does
he
think
that
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
is
supreme
in
all
religious
matters
in
america
how
on
earth
he
knows
that
the
women
are
all
vulgar
when
he
has
never
seen
one
of
them
is
a
mystery
said
harry
and
that
they
are
dishonest
in
all
their
dealings
said
joe
i
suppose
he
got
that
out
of
some
of
the
radical
news
papers
for
joe
after
the
manner
of
brewers
was
a
staunch
tory
and
their
president
too
is
vulgar
as
well
as
the
ladies
said
annesley
and
this
is
the
opinion
of
an
educated
englishman
who
is
not
ashamed
to
own
that
he
entertains
serious
antipathies
against
a
whole
nation
but
at
the
parsonage
they
soon
returned
to
a
more
serious
consideration
of
the
matter
did
uncle
prosper
intend
to
forgive
the
sinner
altogether
and
was
he
coerced
into
doing
so
by
a
conviction
that
he
had
been
told
lies
or
by
the
uncommon
difficulties
which
presented
themselves
to
him
in
reference
to
another
heir
at
any
rate
it
was
agreed
by
them
all
that
harry
must
meet
his
uncle
and
write
the
full
and
complete
explanation
as
desired
speechless
and
motionless
said
harry
i
ca
deny
that
he
was
bleeding
he
certainly
was
speechless
and
for
a
few
moments
may
have
been
motionless
what
am
i
to
say
but
the
letter
was
not
a
difficult
one
to
write
and
was
sent
across
on
the
same
day
to
the
hall
there
prosper
gave
up
a
day
to
its
consideration
a
day
which
would
have
been
much
better
devoted
to
applying
the
final
touch
to
his
own
letter
to
miss
thoroughbung
and
he
found
at
last
that
his
nephew
letter
required
no
rejoinder
but
harry
had
much
to
do
it
was
first
necessary
that
he
should
see
his
friend
and
explain
to
him
that
causes
over
which
he
had
no
control
forbade
him
to
go
to
america
of
course
you
know
i
ca
fly
in
my
uncle
face
i
was
going
because
he
intended
to
disinherit
me
but
he
finds
that
more
troublesome
than
letting
me
alone
and
therefore
i
must
remain
you
see
what
he
says
about
the
americans
the
gentleman
whose
opinion
about
our
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
was
very
different
from
prosper
fell
into
a
long
argument
on
the
subject
but
he
was
obliged
at
last
to
give
up
his
companion
then
came
the
necessity
of
explaining
the
change
in
all
his
plans
to
florence
mountjoy
and
with
this
view
he
wrote
the
short
letter
given
at
the
beginning
of
the
chapter
following
it
down
in
person
to
cheltenham
mamma
harry
is
here
said
florence
to
her
mother
well
my
dear
i
did
not
bring
him
but
what
am
i
to
say
to
him
how
can
i
tell
why
do
you
ask
me
of
course
he
must
come
and
see
me
said
florence
he
has
sent
a
note
to
say
that
he
will
be
here
in
ten
minutes
oh
dear
oh
dear
exclaimed
mountjoy
do
you
mean
to
be
present
mamma
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
but
that
was
the
question
which
at
the
moment
mountjoy
could
not
answer
she
had
pledged
herself
not
to
be
unkind
on
condition
that
no
marriage
should
take
place
for
three
years
but
she
could
not
begin
by
being
kind
as
otherwise
she
would
immediately
have
been
pressed
to
abandon
that
very
condition
perhaps
mamma
it
would
be
less
painful
if
you
would
not
see
him
but
he
is
not
to
make
repeated
visits
no
not
at
present
i
think
not
he
must
come
only
once
said
mountjoy
firmly
he
was
to
have
come
because
he
was
going
to
america
but
now
he
has
changed
all
his
plans
it
is
fair
florence
what
can
i
do
i
can
not
send
him
to
america
because
you
thought
he
was
to
go
there
i
thought
so
too
and
so
did
he
i
do
know
what
has
changed
him
but
it
was
likely
that
he
write
and
say
he
come
because
he
had
altered
his
plans
of
course
he
wants
to
see
me
and
so
do
i
want
to
see
him
very
much
here
he
is
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
mountjoy
was
driven
to
resolve
what
she
would
do
at
the
moment
you
must
be
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
wo
have
you
together
for
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
twenty
minutes
at
the
farthest
so
saying
mountjoy
escaped
from
the
room
and
within
a
minute
or
two
florence
found
herself
in
harry
annesley
arms
the
twenty
minutes
had
become
forty
before
harry
had
thought
of
stirring
although
he
had
been
admonished
fully
a
dozen
times
that
he
must
at
that
moment
take
his
departure
then
the
maid
knocked
at
the
door
and
brought
word
that
missus
wanted
to
see
miss
florence
in
her
bedroom
now
harry
you
must
go
you
really
shall
go
or
i
will
i
am
very
very
happy
to
hear
what
you
have
told
me
but
three
years
unless
mamma
will
agree
it
is
quite
out
of
the
question
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
absurd
then
you
must
get
mamma
to
consent
i
have
promised
her
for
three
years
and
you
ought
to
know
that
i
will
keep
my
word
harry
i
always
keep
my
word
do
i
not
if
she
will
consent
i
will
now
sir
i
really
must
go
then
there
was
a
little
form
of
farewell
which
need
not
be
especially
explained
and
florence
went
up
stairs
to
her
mother
chapter
xlix
captain
vignolles
gets
his
money
when
we
last
left
captain
scarborough
he
had
just
lost
an
additional
sum
of
two
hundred
and
pounds
to
captain
vignolles
which
he
was
not
able
to
pay
besides
the
sum
of
fifty
pounds
which
he
had
received
the
day
before
as
the
first
instalment
of
his
new
allowance
this
was
but
a
bad
beginning
of
the
new
life
he
was
expected
to
lead
under
the
renewed
fortunes
which
his
father
was
preparing
for
him
he
had
given
his
promissory
note
for
the
money
at
a
week
date
and
had
been
extremely
angry
with
captain
vignolles
because
that
gentleman
had
under
the
circumstances
been
a
little
anxious
about
it
it
certainly
was
not
singular
that
he
should
have
been
so
as
captain
scarborough
had
been
turned
out
of
more
than
one
club
in
consequence
of
his
inability
to
pay
his
card
debts
as
he
went
home
to
his
lodgings
with
captain
vignolles
champagne
in
his
head
he
felt
very
much
as
he
had
done
that
night
when
he
attacked
harry
annesley
but
he
met
no
one
whom
he
could
consider
as
an
enemy
and
therefore
got
himself
to
bed
and
slept
off
the
fumes
of
the
drink
on
that
day
he
was
to
return
to
tretton
but
when
he
awoke
he
felt
that
before
he
did
so
he
must
endeavor
to
make
some
arrangements
for
paying
the
amount
due
at
the
end
of
the
week
he
had
already
borrowed
twenty
pounds
from
grey
and
had
intended
to
repay
him
out
of
the
sum
which
his
father
had
given
him
but
that
sum
now
was
gone
and
he
was
again
nearly
penniless
in
this
emergency
there
was
nothing
left
to
him
but
again
to
go
to
grey
as
he
was
shown
up
the
stairs
to
the
lawyer
room
he
did
feel
thoroughly
ashamed
of
himself
grey
knew
all
the
circumstances
of
his
career
and
it
would
be
necessary
now
to
tell
him
of
this
last
adventure
he
did
tell
himself
as
he
dragged
himself
up
the
stairs
that
for
such
a
one
as
he
was
there
could
be
no
redemption
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
go
back
he
said
and
throw
myself
from
the
monument
but
yet
he
felt
that
if
florence
mountjoy
could
still
be
his
there
might
yet
be
a
hope
that
things
would
go
well
with
him
grey
began
by
expressing
surprise
at
seeing
captain
scarborough
in
town
oh
yes
i
have
come
up
it
does
not
matter
why
because
as
usual
i
have
put
my
foot
in
it
it
was
at
my
father
bidding
but
that
does
not
matter
how
have
you
put
your
foot
in
it
said
the
attorney
there
was
one
way
in
which
the
captain
was
always
putting
both
his
feet
in
it
but
since
he
had
been
turned
out
of
his
clubs
grey
did
not
think
that
that
way
was
open
to
him
the
old
story
do
you
mean
that
you
have
been
gambling
again
yes
i
met
a
friend
last
night
and
he
asked
me
to
his
rooms
and
he
had
the
cards
ready
of
course
he
had
what
else
would
any
one
have
ready
for
me
and
he
won
that
remnant
of
the
twenty
pounds
which
you
borrowed
from
me
and
therefore
you
want
another
hereupon
the
captain
shook
his
head
what
is
it
then
that
you
do
want
such
a
man
as
i
met
said
the
captain
would
not
be
content
with
the
remnant
of
twenty
pounds
i
had
received
fifty
from
my
father
and
had
intended
to
call
here
and
pay
you
that
has
all
gone
too
yes
indeed
and
in
addition
to
that
i
have
given
him
a
note
for
two
hundred
and
pounds
which
i
must
take
up
in
a
week
time
otherwise
i
must
disappear
again
and
this
time
forever
it
is
a
bottomless
gulf
said
the
attorney
captain
scarborough
sat
silent
with
something
almost
approaching
to
a
smile
on
his
mouth
but
his
heart
within
him
certainly
was
not
smiling
a
bottomless
gulf
repeated
the
attorney
upon
this
the
captain
frowned
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
for
you
i
have
no
money
of
your
father
in
my
hands
nor
could
i
give
it
you
if
i
had
it
i
suppose
not
i
must
go
back
to
him
and
tell
him
that
it
is
so
then
it
was
the
lawyer
turn
to
be
silent
and
he
remained
thinking
of
it
all
till
captain
scarborough
rose
from
his
seat
and
prepared
to
go
i
wo
trouble
you
any
more
grey
he
said
sit
down
said
grey
but
the
captain
still
remained
standing
sit
down
of
course
i
can
take
out
my
and
write
a
check
for
this
sum
of
money
nothing
would
be
so
easy
and
if
i
could
succeed
in
explaining
it
to
your
father
during
his
lifetime
he
no
doubt
would
repay
me
and
for
the
sake
of
auld
lang
syne
i
should
not
be
unhappy
about
my
money
whether
he
did
so
or
not
but
would
it
be
wise
on
your
own
account
would
it
be
wise
i
can
not
say
that
anything
done
for
me
would
be
wise
unless
you
could
cut
my
throat
and
yet
there
is
no
one
whose
future
life
might
be
easier
your
father
the
circumstances
of
whose
life
are
the
most
singular
i
ever
knew
i
shall
never
believe
all
this
about
my
mother
never
mind
that
now
we
will
pass
that
by
for
the
present
he
has
disinherited
you
that
will
be
a
question
some
day
for
the
lawyers
should
i
live
but
circumstances
have
so
gone
with
him
that
he
is
enabled
to
leave
you
another
fortune
he
is
very
angry
with
your
brother
in
which
anger
i
sympathize
he
will
strip
tretton
as
bare
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
for
your
sake
you
have
always
been
his
favorite
and
so
in
spite
of
all
things
you
are
still
they
tell
me
he
can
not
last
for
six
months
longer
heaven
knows
i
do
not
wish
him
to
die
but
he
thinks
that
your
brother
does
he
feels
that
augustus
begrudges
him
a
few
months
longer
life
and
he
is
angry
if
he
could
again
make
you
his
heir
now
that
the
debts
are
all
paid
he
would
do
so
here
the
captain
shook
his
head
but
as
it
is
he
will
leave
you
enough
for
all
the
needs
of
even
a
luxurious
life
here
is
his
will
which
i
am
going
to
send
down
to
him
for
final
execution
this
very
day
my
senior
clerk
will
take
it
and
you
will
meet
him
there
that
will
give
you
ample
for
life
but
what
is
the
use
of
it
all
if
you
can
lose
it
in
one
night
or
in
one
month
among
a
pack
of
scoundrels
if
they
be
scoundrels
i
am
one
of
them
you
lose
your
money
you
are
their
dupe
to
the
best
of
my
belief
you
have
never
won
the
dupes
lose
and
the
scoundrels
win
it
must
be
so
you
know
nothing
about
it
mr
grey
this
man
who
had
your
money
last
does
he
not
live
on
it
as
a
profession
why
should
he
win
always
and
you
lose
it
is
my
luck
luck
there
is
no
such
thing
as
luck
toss
up
right
hand
against
left
for
an
hour
together
and
the
result
will
be
the
same
if
not
for
an
hour
then
do
it
for
six
hours
take
the
average
and
your
cards
will
be
the
same
as
another
man
another
man
has
his
skill
said
mountjoy
and
uses
it
against
the
unskillful
to
earn
his
daily
bread
that
is
the
same
as
cheating
but
what
is
the
use
of
all
this
you
must
have
thought
of
it
all
before
yes
indeed
and
thinking
of
it
you
are
determined
to
persevere
you
are
impetuous
not
thoughtless
with
your
brain
clouded
with
drink
and
for
the
mere
excitement
of
the
thing
you
are
determined
to
risk
all
in
a
contest
for
which
there
is
no
chance
for
you
and
by
which
you
acknowledge
you
will
be
driven
to
as
the
only
natural
end
i
fear
it
is
so
said
the
captain
how
much
shall
i
draw
it
for
said
the
attorney
taking
out
his
and
to
whom
shall
i
make
it
payable
i
suppose
i
may
date
it
so
that
the
swindler
who
gets
it
may
think
that
there
is
plenty
more
behind
for
him
to
get
do
you
mean
that
you
are
going
to
lend
it
me
oh
yes
and
how
do
you
mean
to
get
it
again
i
must
wait
i
suppose
till
you
have
won
it
back
among
your
friends
if
you
will
tell
me
that
you
do
not
intend
to
look
for
it
in
that
fashion
then
i
shall
have
no
doubt
as
to
your
making
me
a
legitimate
payment
in
a
very
short
time
two
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
wo
ruin
you
unless
you
are
determined
to
ruin
yourself
grey
the
meanwhile
went
on
writing
the
check
here
is
provided
for
you
a
large
sum
of
money
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
will
out
of
which
you
will
be
able
to
pay
me
without
the
slightest
difficulty
it
is
for
you
to
say
whether
you
will
or
not
i
will
you
need
not
say
it
in
that
fashion
that
easy
you
must
say
it
at
some
moment
when
the
itch
of
play
is
on
you
when
there
shall
be
no
one
by
to
hear
when
the
resolution
if
held
shall
have
some
meaning
in
it
then
say
that
money
which
i
had
from
old
grey
i
am
bound
to
pay
it
but
if
i
go
in
there
i
know
what
will
be
the
result
the
very
coin
that
should
go
into
his
coffers
will
become
a
part
of
the
prey
on
which
those
harpies
will
feed
there
the
check
for
the
two
hundred
and
pounds
i
have
drawn
it
exact
so
that
you
may
send
the
identical
bit
of
paper
to
your
friend
he
will
suppose
that
i
am
some
who
has
engaged
to
supply
your
needs
while
your
recovered
fortune
lasts
tell
your
father
he
shall
have
the
will
i
do
suppose
i
can
send
smith
with
it
then
it
became
necessary
that
scarborough
should
go
but
it
would
be
becoming
that
he
should
first
utter
some
words
of
thanks
i
think
you
will
get
it
back
mr
grey
i
dare
say
i
think
you
will
it
may
be
that
the
having
to
pay
you
will
keep
me
for
a
while
from
the
you
do
look
for
more
than
that
i
am
an
unfortunate
man
grey
there
is
one
thing
that
would
cure
me
but
that
one
thing
is
beyond
my
reach
some
woman
well
it
is
a
woman
i
think
i
could
keep
my
money
for
the
sake
of
her
comfort
but
never
mind
grey
i
think
i
shall
remember
what
you
have
done
for
me
then
he
went
and
sent
the
identical
check
to
captain
vignolles
with
the
shortest
and
most
uncourteous
epistle
dear
sir
i
send
you
your
money
send
back
the
note
yours
m
scarborough
i
hardly
expected
this
said
the
captain
to
himself
as
he
pocketed
the
check
at
any
rate
not
so
soon
venture
nothing
have
that
moody
is
a
slow
coach
and
will
never
do
anything
i
thought
there
be
a
little
money
about
with
him
for
a
time
then
the
captain
turned
over
in
his
mind
that
night
good
work
with
the
air
of
an
industrious
professional
worker
but
grey
was
not
so
well
satisfied
with
himself
and
determined
for
a
while
to
say
nothing
to
dolly
of
the
two
hundred
and
pounds
which
he
had
undoubtedly
risked
by
the
loan
but
his
mind
misgave
him
before
he
went
to
sleep
and
he
felt
that
he
could
not
be
comfortable
till
he
had
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
during
the
evening
dolly
had
been
talking
to
him
of
all
the
troubles
of
all
the
carrolls
how
amelia
would
hardly
speak
to
her
father
or
her
mother
because
of
her
injured
lover
and
was
absolutely
insolent
to
her
dolly
whenever
they
met
how
sophia
had
declared
that
promises
ought
to
be
kept
and
that
amelia
should
be
got
rid
of
and
how
carroll
had
told
her
in
confidence
that
carroll
had
come
home
the
night
before
drunker
than
usual
and
had
behaved
most
abominably
but
grey
had
attended
very
little
to
all
this
having
his
mind
preoccupied
with
the
secret
of
the
money
which
he
had
lent
therefore
dolly
did
not
put
out
her
candle
and
arrayed
herself
for
bed
in
the
costume
with
which
she
was
wont
to
make
her
nocturnal
visits
she
had
perceived
that
her
father
had
something
on
his
mind
which
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
tell
she
was
soon
summoned
and
having
seated
herself
on
the
bed
began
the
conversation
i
knew
you
would
want
me
why
so
because
you
got
something
to
tell
it
about
mr
barry
no
indeed
that
well
just
at
this
moment
i
seem
to
care
about
barry
more
than
any
other
trouble
but
i
fear
that
he
has
forgotten
me
altogether
which
is
not
complimentary
barry
will
turn
up
all
in
proper
time
said
her
father
i
have
got
nothing
to
say
about
barry
just
at
present
so
if
you
are
you
had
better
go
to
bed
very
well
when
i
am
i
will
now
what
have
you
got
to
tell
me
i
have
lent
a
man
a
large
sum
of
money
two
hundred
and
pounds
you
are
always
lending
people
large
sums
of
money
i
generally
get
it
back
again
from
carroll
for
instance
when
he
borrows
it
for
a
pair
of
breeches
and
spends
it
in
i
never
lent
him
a
shilling
he
is
a
burr
and
has
to
be
pacified
not
by
loans
but
gifts
it
is
too
late
now
for
me
to
prevent
the
of
poor
carroll
who
has
got
this
money
a
professed
gambler
who
never
wins
anything
and
constantly
loses
more
than
he
is
able
to
pay
yet
i
do
think
this
man
will
pay
me
some
day
it
is
captain
scarborough
said
dolly
seeing
that
his
father
is
a
very
rich
man
indeed
and
as
far
as
i
can
understand
gives
you
a
great
deal
more
trouble
than
he
is
worth
i
do
see
why
you
should
lend
a
large
sum
of
money
to
his
son
simply
because
he
wanted
it
oh
dear
oh
dear
he
wanted
it
very
much
he
had
gone
away
a
ruined
man
because
of
his
gambling
and
now
when
he
had
come
back
and
was
to
be
put
upon
his
legs
again
i
could
not
see
him
again
ruined
for
the
need
of
such
a
sum
it
was
very
foolish
perhaps
a
little
rash
papa
but
now
i
have
told
you
and
so
there
may
be
an
end
of
it
but
tell
you
what
dolly
i
bet
you
a
new
straw
hat
he
pays
me
within
a
month
of
his
father
death
then
dolly
was
allowed
to
escape
and
betake
herself
to
her
bed
on
that
same
day
mountjoy
scarborough
went
down
to
tretton
and
was
at
once
closeted
with
his
father
scarborough
had
questions
to
ask
about
prosper
and
was
anxious
to
know
how
his
son
had
succeeded
in
his
mission
but
the
conversation
was
soon
turned
from
prosper
to
captain
vignolles
and
grey
mountjoy
had
determined
as
soon
as
he
had
got
the
check
from
grey
to
say
nothing
about
it
to
his
father
he
had
told
grey
in
order
that
he
need
not
tell
his
father
if
the
money
were
forthcoming
but
he
had
not
been
five
minutes
in
his
room
before
he
rushed
to
the
subject
you
got
among
those
birds
of
prey
again
said
his
father
there
was
only
one
bird
or
at
least
two
a
big
bird
and
a
small
one
and
you
lost
how
much
then
the
captain
told
the
precise
sum
and
grey
has
lent
it
you
the
captain
nodded
his
head
then
you
must
ride
into
tretton
and
catch
the
mail
with
a
check
to
repay
him
that
you
should
have
been
able
in
so
short
a
time
to
have
found
a
man
willing
to
fleece
you
i
suppose
it
hopeless
i
can
not
tell
altogether
hopeless
what
am
i
to
say
sir
if
i
make
a
promise
it
will
go
for
nothing
for
absolutely
nothing
then
what
would
be
the
use
of
my
promising
you
are
quite
logical
and
look
upon
the
matter
in
altogether
a
proper
light
as
you
have
ruined
yourself
so
often
and
done
your
best
to
ruin
those
that
belong
to
you
what
hope
can
there
be
about
this
money
that
i
have
left
you
i
do
not
know
that
anything
farther
can
be
said
unless
i
leave
it
all
to
an
hospital
it
is
better
that
you
should
have
it
and
throw
it
away
among
the
gamblers
than
that
it
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
augustus
besides
the
demand
is
moderate
no
doubt
it
is
only
a
beginning
but
we
will
see
then
he
got
out
his
and
made
mountjoy
himself
write
the
check
including
the
two
sums
which
had
been
borrowed
and
he
dictated
the
letter
to
grey
my
dear
grey
i
return
the
money
which
mountjoy
has
had
from
you
two
hundred
and
pounds
and
twenty
that
i
think
is
right
you
are
the
most
foolish
man
i
know
with
your
money
to
have
given
it
to
such
a
scapegrace
as
my
son
mountjoy
but
you
are
the
sweetest
and
finest
gentleman
i
ever
came
across
you
have
got
your
money
now
which
is
a
great
deal
more
than
you
can
have
expected
or
ought
to
have
obtained
however
on
this
occasion
you
have
been
in
great
luck
yours
faithfully
john
scarborough
this
letter
his
son
himself
was
forced
to
write
though
it
dealt
altogether
with
his
own
delinquencies
and
yet
as
he
told
himself
he
was
not
sorry
to
write
it
as
it
would
declare
to
grey
that
he
had
himself
acknowledged
at
once
his
own
sin
the
only
farther
punishment
which
his
father
exacted
was
that
his
son
should
himself
ride
into
tretton
and
post
the
letter
before
he
ate
his
dinner
i
got
my
money
said
grey
waving
the
check
as
he
went
into
his
with
dolly
at
his
heels
who
has
paid
it
old
scarborough
and
he
made
mountjoy
write
the
letter
himself
calling
me
an
old
fool
for
lending
it
i
do
think
i
was
such
a
fool
at
all
however
i
got
my
money
and
you
may
pay
the
bet
and
not
say
anything
more
about
it
chapter
the
last
of
miss
thoroughbung
prosper
with
that
kind
of
energy
which
was
distinctively
his
own
had
sent
off
his
letter
to
harry
annesley
with
his
postscript
in
it
about
his
blighted
matrimonial
prospects
a
letter
easy
to
be
written
before
he
had
completed
his
grand
epistle
to
miss
thoroughbung
the
epistle
to
miss
thoroughbung
was
one
requiring
great
consideration
it
had
to
be
studied
in
every
word
and
again
and
again
with
the
profoundest
care
he
was
afraid
that
he
might
commit
himself
by
an
epithet
he
dreaded
even
an
adverb
too
much
he
found
that
a
full
stop
expressed
his
feelings
too
violently
and
wrote
the
letter
again
for
the
fifth
time
because
of
the
big
initial
which
followed
the
full
stop
the
consequence
of
all
this
long
delay
was
that
miss
thoroughbung
had
heard
the
news
through
the
brewery
before
it
reached
her
in
its
legitimate
course
prosper
had
written
his
postscript
by
accident
and
in
writing
it
had
forgotten
the
intercourse
between
his
house
and
the
buntingford
people
he
had
known
well
of
the
proposed
marriage
but
he
was
a
man
who
could
not
think
of
two
things
at
the
same
time
and
thus
had
committed
the
blunder
perhaps
it
was
better
for
him
as
it
was
and
the
blow
came
to
him
with
a
rapidity
which
created
less
of
suffering
than
might
have
followed
the
slower
mode
of
proceeding
which
he
had
intended
he
was
actually
making
the
fifth
copy
of
the
letter
rendered
necessary
by
that
violent
full
stop
when
matthew
came
to
him
and
announced
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
in
the
in
the
house
ejaculated
prosper
she
would
come
into
the
hall
and
then
where
was
i
to
put
her
matthew
pike
you
will
not
do
for
my
service
this
had
been
said
about
once
every
three
months
throughout
the
long
course
of
years
in
which
matthew
had
lived
with
his
master
very
well
sir
i
am
to
take
it
for
a
month
warning
of
course
matthew
understood
well
enough
that
this
was
merely
an
expression
of
his
master
displeasure
and
being
anxious
for
his
master
welfare
knew
that
it
was
decorous
that
some
decision
should
be
come
to
at
once
as
to
miss
thoroughbung
and
that
time
should
not
be
lost
in
his
own
little
personal
quarrel
she
is
waiting
you
know
sir
and
she
looks
uncommon
irascible
there
is
the
other
lady
left
outside
in
the
carriage
miss
tickle
do
let
her
in
whatever
you
do
she
is
the
worst
oh
dear
oh
dear
where
are
my
coat
and
waistcoat
and
my
braces
and
i
have
brushed
my
hair
and
these
slippers
wo
do
what
business
has
she
to
come
at
this
time
of
day
without
saying
a
word
to
anybody
then
matthew
went
to
work
and
got
his
master
into
decent
apparel
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
after
all
said
prosper
i
do
think
i
see
her
why
should
i
see
her
she
knows
you
are
at
home
sir
why
does
she
know
i
at
home
that
your
fault
she
ought
to
know
anything
about
it
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
these
last
ejaculations
arose
from
his
having
just
then
remembered
the
nature
of
his
postscript
to
harry
annesley
and
the
engagement
of
joe
thoroughbung
to
his
niece
he
made
up
his
mind
at
the
moment
or
thought
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
harry
annesley
should
not
have
a
shilling
as
long
as
he
lived
i
am
quite
out
of
breath
i
can
not
see
her
yet
go
and
offer
the
lady
cake
and
wine
and
tell
her
that
you
had
found
me
very
much
indisposed
i
think
you
will
have
to
tell
her
that
i
am
not
well
enough
to
receive
her
get
it
over
sir
and
have
done
with
it
it
all
very
well
to
say
have
done
with
it
i
shall
never
have
done
with
it
because
you
have
let
her
in
she
think
that
she
can
come
always
good
lord
there
she
is
on
the
stairs
pick
up
my
slippers
then
the
door
was
opened
and
miss
thoroughbung
herself
entered
the
room
it
was
an
chamber
known
as
own
and
from
it
was
the
door
into
his
bedroom
how
miss
thoroughbung
had
learned
her
way
to
it
he
never
could
guess
but
she
had
come
up
the
stairs
as
though
she
had
been
acquainted
with
all
the
intricacies
of
the
house
from
her
childhood
prosper
she
said
i
hope
i
see
you
quite
well
this
morning
and
that
i
have
not
disturbed
you
at
your
toilet
that
she
had
done
so
was
evident
from
the
fact
that
matthew
with
the
and
slippers
was
seen
disappearing
into
the
bedroom
i
am
not
very
well
thank
you
said
prosper
rising
from
his
chair
and
offering
her
his
hand
with
the
coldest
possible
salutation
i
am
sorry
for
that
very
i
hope
it
is
not
your
indisposition
which
has
prevented
you
from
coming
to
see
me
i
have
been
expecting
you
every
day
since
soames
wrote
his
last
letter
but
it
no
use
pretending
any
longer
oh
peter
peter
this
use
of
his
christian
name
struck
him
absolutely
dumb
so
that
he
was
unable
to
utter
a
syllable
he
should
first
of
all
have
told
her
that
any
excuse
she
had
before
for
calling
him
by
his
christian
name
was
now
at
an
end
but
there
was
no
opening
for
speech
such
as
that
well
she
continued
have
you
got
nothing
to
say
to
me
you
can
write
flippant
letters
to
other
people
and
turn
me
into
ridicule
glibly
enough
i
have
never
done
so
did
you
not
write
to
joe
thoroughbung
and
tell
him
you
had
given
up
all
thoughts
of
having
me
joe
he
exclaimed
his
very
surprise
did
not
permit
him
to
go
farther
at
the
moment
than
this
utterance
of
the
young
man
christian
name
yes
joe
joe
thoroughbung
my
nephew
and
yours
that
is
to
be
did
you
not
write
and
tell
him
that
everything
was
over
i
never
wrote
to
young
thoroughbung
in
my
life
i
should
not
have
dreamed
of
such
a
correspondence
on
such
a
subject
well
he
says
you
did
or
if
you
did
write
to
joe
himself
you
wrote
to
somebody
i
may
have
written
to
somebody
certainly
and
told
them
that
you
did
mean
to
have
anything
farther
to
say
to
me
that
traitor
harry
had
now
committed
a
sin
worse
that
knocking
a
man
down
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
leaving
him
bleeding
speechless
and
motionless
worse
than
telling
a
lie
about
it
worse
even
than
declining
to
listen
to
sermons
read
by
his
uncle
harry
had
committed
such
a
sin
that
no
shilling
of
allowance
should
evermore
be
paid
to
him
even
at
this
moment
there
went
through
prosper
brain
an
idea
that
there
might
be
some
unmarried
female
in
england
besides
miss
puffle
and
miss
thoroughbung
peter
prosper
why
do
you
answer
like
a
man
and
tell
me
the
honest
truth
he
had
never
before
been
called
peter
prosper
in
his
whole
life
perhaps
you
had
better
let
me
make
a
communication
by
letter
he
said
at
that
very
moment
the
all
but
completed
epistle
was
lying
on
the
table
before
him
where
even
her
eyes
might
reach
it
in
the
flurry
of
the
moment
he
covered
it
up
perhaps
that
is
the
letter
which
has
taken
you
so
long
to
write
she
said
it
is
the
letter
then
hand
it
me
over
and
save
yourself
the
penny
stamp
in
his
confusion
he
gave
her
the
letter
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
sofa
while
she
read
it
you
have
been
very
careful
in
choosing
your
language
prosper
will
be
expedient
that
i
should
make
known
to
you
the
entire
truth
certainly
prosper
certainly
the
entire
truth
is
the
best
thing
next
to
entire
beer
my
brother
would
say
the
horrid
vulgar
woman
prosper
ejaculated
to
himself
seems
to
have
been
a
complete
misunderstanding
with
regard
to
that
amiable
lady
miss
tickle
no
misunderstanding
at
all
you
said
you
liked
her
and
i
supposed
you
did
and
when
i
had
been
living
for
twenty
years
with
a
female
companion
who
has
sixpence
in
the
world
to
buy
a
rag
with
but
what
she
gets
from
me
was
it
to
be
expected
that
i
should
turn
her
out
for
any
man
an
annuity
might
have
been
arranged
miss
thoroughbung
bother
an
annuity
that
all
you
think
about
feelings
was
she
to
go
and
live
alone
and
desolate
because
you
wanted
some
one
to
nurse
you
and
then
those
wretched
ponies
i
tell
you
peter
prosper
that
let
me
marry
whom
i
will
i
mean
to
drive
a
pair
of
ponies
and
am
able
to
do
so
out
of
my
own
money
ponies
indeed
it
an
excuse
your
heart
has
failed
you
you
come
to
know
a
woman
of
spirit
and
now
you
are
afraid
that
she
be
too
much
for
you
i
shall
keep
this
letter
though
it
has
not
been
sent
you
can
do
as
you
please
about
that
miss
thoroughbung
oh
yes
of
course
i
shall
keep
it
and
shall
give
it
to
soames
simpson
they
are
most
gentlemanlike
men
and
will
be
shocked
at
such
conduct
as
this
from
the
squire
of
buston
the
letter
will
be
published
in
the
newspapers
of
course
it
will
be
very
painful
to
me
no
doubt
but
i
shall
owe
it
to
my
sex
to
punish
you
when
all
the
county
are
talking
of
your
conduct
to
a
lady
and
saying
that
no
man
could
have
done
it
let
alone
no
gentleman
then
you
will
feel
it
miss
tickle
and
a
pair
of
ponies
you
expected
to
get
my
money
and
nothing
to
give
for
it
oh
you
mean
man
she
must
have
been
aware
that
every
word
she
spoke
was
a
dagger
there
was
a
careful
analysis
of
his
peculiar
character
displayed
in
every
word
of
reproach
which
she
uttered
nothing
could
have
wounded
him
more
than
the
comparison
between
himself
and
soames
simpson
they
were
gentlemen
the
vulgarest
men
in
all
buntingford
he
declared
to
himself
and
always
ready
for
any
sharp
practice
whereas
he
was
no
man
miss
thoroughbung
said
a
mean
creature
altogether
unworthy
to
be
regarded
as
a
gentleman
he
knew
himself
to
be
prosper
of
buston
hall
with
centuries
of
prospers
for
his
ancestors
whereas
soames
was
the
son
of
a
and
simpson
had
come
down
from
london
as
a
clerk
from
a
solicitor
office
in
the
city
and
yet
it
was
true
that
people
would
talk
of
him
as
did
miss
thoroughbung
his
cruelty
would
be
in
every
lady
mouth
and
then
his
stinginess
about
the
ponies
would
be
the
gossip
of
the
county
for
twelve
months
and
as
he
found
out
what
miss
thoroughbung
was
the
disgrace
of
even
having
wished
to
marry
her
loomed
terribly
large
before
him
but
there
was
a
twinkle
of
jest
in
the
lady
eyes
all
the
while
which
he
did
not
perceive
and
which
had
he
perceived
it
he
could
not
have
understood
her
anger
was
but
simulated
wrath
she
too
had
thought
that
it
might
be
well
under
circumstances
if
she
were
to
marry
prosper
but
had
quite
understood
that
those
circumstances
might
not
be
forthcoming
i
do
think
it
will
do
at
all
my
dear
she
had
said
to
miss
tickle
of
course
an
old
bachelor
like
that
wo
want
to
have
you
i
beg
you
wo
think
of
me
for
a
moment
miss
tickle
had
answered
with
solemnity
bother
why
ca
you
tell
the
truth
i
not
going
to
throw
you
over
and
of
course
you
be
just
nowhere
if
i
did
i
sha
break
my
heart
for
prosper
i
know
i
should
be
an
old
fool
if
i
were
to
marry
him
and
he
is
more
of
an
old
fool
for
wanting
to
marry
me
but
i
did
think
he
would
cut
up
so
rough
about
the
ponies
and
then
when
no
answer
came
to
the
last
letter
from
soames
simpson
and
the
tidings
reached
her
round
from
the
brewery
that
prosper
intended
to
be
off
she
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
but
the
information
she
thought
had
come
to
her
in
an
unworthy
manner
so
she
determined
to
punish
the
gentleman
and
went
out
to
buston
hall
and
called
him
peter
prosper
we
may
doubt
however
whether
she
had
ever
realized
how
terribly
her
scourges
would
wale
him
and
to
think
that
you
would
let
it
come
round
to
me
in
that
way
through
the
young
people
writing
about
it
just
as
a
joke
i
never
wrote
about
it
like
a
joke
said
prosper
almost
crying
i
remember
now
it
was
to
your
nephew
and
of
course
everybody
at
the
rectory
saw
it
of
course
they
were
all
laughing
at
you
there
was
one
thing
now
written
in
the
book
of
fate
and
sealed
as
certainly
as
the
crack
of
doom
no
shilling
of
allowance
should
ever
be
paid
to
harry
annesley
he
would
go
abroad
he
said
so
to
himself
as
he
thought
of
this
and
said
also
that
if
he
could
find
a
healthy
young
woman
anywhere
he
would
marry
her
sacrificing
every
idea
of
his
own
happiness
to
his
desire
of
revenge
upon
his
nephew
this
however
was
only
the
passionate
feeling
of
the
moment
matrimony
had
become
altogether
so
distasteful
to
him
since
he
had
become
intimately
acquainted
with
miss
thoroughbung
as
to
make
any
release
in
that
manner
quite
impossible
to
him
do
you
propose
to
make
me
any
amends
asked
miss
thoroughbung
money
said
he
yes
money
why
should
you
pay
me
money
i
should
like
to
keep
three
ponies
and
to
have
miss
tickle
sister
to
come
and
live
with
me
i
do
not
know
whether
you
are
in
earnest
miss
thoroughbung
quite
in
earnest
peter
prosper
but
perhaps
i
had
better
leave
that
matter
in
the
hands
of
soames
simpson
very
men
and
they
be
sure
to
let
you
know
how
much
you
ought
to
pay
ten
thousand
pounds
would
be
too
much
considering
the
distress
to
my
wounded
feelings
here
miss
thoroughbung
put
her
handkerchief
up
to
her
eyes
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
say
whether
she
were
laughing
at
him
as
he
thought
to
be
most
probable
or
whether
there
was
some
grain
of
truth
in
the
demand
which
she
made
he
found
it
equally
impossible
to
make
any
reply
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
say
nor
could
he
absolutely
turn
her
out
of
the
room
but
after
ten
minutes
farther
continuation
of
these
amenities
during
which
it
did
at
last
come
home
to
his
brain
that
she
was
merely
laughing
at
him
he
began
to
think
that
he
might
possibly
escape
and
leave
her
there
in
possession
of
his
chamber
if
you
will
excuse
me
miss
thoroughbung
i
will
retire
he
said
rising
from
the
sofa
regularly
chaffed
out
of
your
own
den
she
said
laughing
i
do
not
like
this
interchange
of
wit
on
subjects
that
are
so
serious
interchange
there
is
very
little
interchange
according
to
my
idea
you
have
said
anything
witty
what
an
idea
of
interchange
the
man
has
at
any
rate
i
will
escape
from
your
rudeness
now
peter
prosper
before
you
go
let
me
ask
you
one
question
which
of
the
two
has
been
the
rudest
to
the
other
you
have
come
and
asked
me
to
marry
you
and
have
evidently
wished
to
back
out
of
it
from
the
moment
in
which
you
found
that
i
had
ideas
of
my
own
about
money
and
now
you
call
me
rude
because
i
have
my
little
revenge
i
have
called
you
peter
prosper
and
you
ca
stand
it
you
have
spirit
enough
to
call
me
matty
thoroughbung
in
reply
but
prosper
for
i
never
will
call
you
peter
again
as
to
what
i
said
to
you
about
money
that
of
course
is
all
bosh
i
pay
soames
bill
and
will
never
trouble
you
there
your
letter
which
however
would
be
of
no
use
because
it
is
not
signed
a
very
stupid
letter
it
is
if
you
want
to
write
naturally
you
should
never
copy
a
letter
prosper
peter
that
never
shall
be
then
she
got
up
and
walked
out
of
the
room
prosper
when
he
was
left
alone
remained
for
a
while
nearly
paralyzed
that
he
should
have
ever
entertained
the
idea
of
making
that
woman
his
wife
such
was
his
first
thought
then
he
reflected
that
he
had
in
truth
escaped
from
her
more
easily
than
he
had
hoped
and
that
she
had
certainly
displayed
some
good
qualities
in
spite
of
her
vulgarity
and
impudence
she
did
not
at
any
rate
intend
to
trouble
him
any
farther
he
would
never
again
hear
himself
called
peter
by
that
terribly
loud
voice
but
his
anger
became
very
fierce
against
the
whole
family
at
the
rectory
they
had
ventured
to
laugh
at
him
and
he
could
understand
that
in
their
eyes
he
had
become
very
ridiculous
he
could
see
it
all
the
manner
in
which
they
had
made
fun
of
him
and
had
been
jocose
over
his
intended
marriage
he
certainly
had
not
intended
to
be
funny
in
their
eyes
but
while
he
had
been
exercising
the
duty
of
a
stern
master
over
them
and
had
been
aware
of
his
own
extreme
generosity
in
his
efforts
to
forgive
his
nephew
that
very
nephew
had
been
laughing
at
him
in
conjunction
with
the
nephew
of
her
whom
he
had
intended
to
make
his
wife
not
a
shilling
again
should
ever
be
allowed
to
harry
annesley
if
it
could
be
so
arranged
by
any
change
of
circumstances
he
might
even
yet
become
the
father
of
a
family
of
his
own
chapter
li
prosper
is
taken
ill
when
harry
annesley
returned
from
cheltenham
which
he
did
about
the
beginning
of
february
he
was
a
very
happy
man
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
within
his
own
heart
he
was
more
exalted
than
is
fitting
for
a
man
mortal
for
a
human
creature
who
may
be
cut
off
from
his
joys
or
may
have
the
very
source
of
his
joy
turned
into
sorrow
he
walked
like
a
god
not
showing
it
by
his
outward
gesture
not
declaring
that
it
was
so
by
any
assumed
grace
or
arrogant
carriage
of
himself
but
knowing
within
himself
that
that
had
happened
down
at
cheltenham
which
had
all
but
divested
him
of
humanity
and
made
a
star
of
him
to
no
one
else
had
it
been
given
to
have
such
feelings
such
an
assurance
of
heavenly
bliss
together
with
the
certainty
that
under
any
circumstances
it
must
be
altogether
his
own
for
ever
and
ever
it
was
thus
he
thought
of
himself
and
what
had
happened
to
him
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
himself
kissed
by
a
young
woman
harry
annesley
was
in
truth
very
proud
of
florence
and
altogether
believed
in
her
he
thought
the
better
of
himself
because
florence
loved
him
not
with
the
vulgar
of
a
man
who
fancies
himself
to
be
a
and
therefore
a
grand
sort
of
fellow
but
in
conceiving
himself
to
be
something
better
than
he
had
hitherto
believed
simply
because
he
had
won
the
heart
of
this
one
special
girl
during
that
at
cheltenham
she
had
so
talked
to
him
and
managed
in
her
own
pretty
way
so
to
express
herself
as
to
make
him
understand
that
of
all
that
there
was
of
her
he
was
the
only
lord
and
master
may
god
do
so
to
me
and
more
also
if
to
the
end
i
do
not
treat
her
not
only
with
all
affection
but
also
with
all
delicacy
of
observance
it
was
thus
that
he
spoke
to
himself
of
her
as
he
walked
away
from
the
door
of
mountjoy
house
in
cheltenham
from
thence
he
went
back
to
buston
and
entered
his
father
house
with
all
that
halo
of
happiness
shining
round
his
heart
he
did
not
say
much
about
it
but
his
mother
and
his
sisters
felt
that
he
was
altered
and
he
understood
their
feelings
when
his
mother
said
to
him
after
a
day
or
two
that
it
was
a
great
shame
that
they
none
of
them
knew
his
florence
but
you
will
have
to
know
her
well
that
of
course
but
it
a
thousand
pities
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
talk
of
her
to
you
as
one
whom
we
know
already
then
he
felt
that
they
had
among
them
all
acknowledged
her
to
be
such
as
she
was
there
came
to
the
rectory
some
tidings
of
the
meeting
which
had
taken
place
at
the
hall
between
his
uncle
and
miss
thoroughbung
it
was
joe
who
brought
to
them
the
first
account
and
then
farther
particulars
leaked
out
among
the
servants
of
the
two
houses
matthew
was
very
discreet
but
even
matthew
must
have
spoken
a
word
or
two
in
the
first
place
there
came
the
news
that
prosper
anger
against
his
nephew
was
hotter
than
ever
harry
must
have
put
his
foot
in
it
somehow
that
had
been
matthew
assurance
made
with
much
sorrow
to
the
or
at
the
rectory
and
then
joe
had
declared
that
all
the
misfortunes
which
had
attended
prosper
courtship
had
been
attributed
to
harry
evil
influences
at
first
this
could
not
but
be
a
matter
of
joke
joe
stories
as
he
told
them
were
full
of
ridicule
and
had
no
doubt
come
to
him
from
miss
thoroughbung
either
directly
or
through
some
of
the
ladies
at
buntingford
it
does
seem
that
your
aunt
has
been
too
many
for
him
this
had
been
said
by
molly
and
had
been
uttered
in
the
presence
both
of
joe
thoroughbung
and
of
harry
why
yes
said
joe
she
has
had
him
under
the
thong
altogether
and
has
not
found
it
difficult
to
flog
him
when
she
had
got
him
by
the
hind
leg
this
idea
had
occurred
to
joe
from
his
remembrance
of
a
peccant
hound
in
the
grasp
of
a
tyrant
whip
it
seems
that
he
offered
her
money
i
should
hardly
think
that
said
harry
standing
up
for
his
uncle
she
says
so
and
says
that
she
declared
that
ten
thousand
pounds
would
be
the
very
lowest
sum
of
course
she
was
laughing
at
him
uncle
prosper
does
like
to
be
laughed
at
said
molly
and
she
did
not
spare
him
said
joe
and
then
she
had
by
heart
the
whole
story
how
she
had
called
him
peter
and
how
angry
he
had
been
at
the
appellation
nobody
calls
him
peter
except
my
mother
said
harry
i
should
not
dream
of
calling
him
uncle
peter
said
molly
do
you
mean
to
say
that
miss
thoroughbung
called
him
peter
where
could
she
have
got
the
courage
to
this
joe
replied
that
he
believed
his
aunt
had
courage
for
anything
under
the
sun
i
do
think
that
she
ought
to
have
called
him
peter
continued
molly
of
course
after
that
there
could
be
a
marriage
i
do
quite
see
why
not
said
joe
i
call
you
molly
and
i
expect
you
to
marry
me
and
i
call
you
joe
and
i
expect
you
to
marry
me
but
we
ai
quite
the
same
the
squire
of
buston
said
joe
considers
himself
squire
of
buston
i
suppose
that
the
old
queen
of
heaven
did
call
jupiter
jove
till
they
been
married
at
any
rate
some
centuries
well
done
joe
said
harry
he
become
fellow
of
a
college
yet
said
molly
if
you
let
me
alone
i
will
said
joe
but
only
conceive
the
kind
of
scene
there
must
have
been
at
the
house
up
there
when
aunt
matty
had
forced
her
way
in
among
your
uncle
slippers
and
have
given
a
note
to
have
seen
and
heard
it
i
have
given
two
if
it
had
never
occurred
he
had
written
me
a
letter
which
i
had
taken
as
a
pardon
in
full
for
all
my
offences
he
had
assured
me
that
he
had
no
intention
of
marrying
and
had
offered
to
give
me
back
my
old
allowance
now
i
am
told
that
he
has
quarrelled
with
me
again
altogether
because
of
some
light
word
as
to
me
and
my
concerns
spoken
by
this
vivacious
old
aunt
of
yours
i
wish
your
vivacious
old
aunt
had
remained
at
buntingford
and
we
had
wished
that
your
vivacious
old
uncle
had
remained
at
buston
when
he
came
to
marmaduke
lodge
he
was
an
old
fool
and
among
ourselves
always
has
been
said
molly
who
on
the
occasion
thought
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
take
the
thoroughbung
rather
than
the
prosper
side
of
the
quarrel
but
in
truth
this
renewed
quarrel
between
the
hall
and
the
rectory
was
likely
to
prove
extremely
deleterious
to
harry
annesley
interests
for
his
welfare
depended
not
solely
on
the
fact
that
he
was
at
present
heir
presumptive
to
his
uncle
nor
yet
on
the
small
allowance
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
made
to
him
by
his
uncle
and
capable
of
being
withdrawn
at
any
moment
but
also
on
the
fact
supposed
to
be
known
to
all
the
world
which
was
known
to
all
the
world
before
the
affair
in
the
streets
with
mountjoy
scarborough
that
harry
was
his
uncle
heir
his
position
had
been
that
of
eldest
son
and
indeed
that
of
only
child
to
a
man
of
acres
and
squire
of
a
parish
he
had
been
made
to
hope
that
this
might
be
restored
to
him
and
at
this
moment
absolutely
had
in
his
pocket
the
check
for
pounds
ten
which
had
been
sent
to
him
by
his
uncle
agent
in
payment
of
the
quarter
income
which
had
been
stopped
but
he
also
had
a
farther
letter
written
on
the
next
day
telling
him
that
he
was
not
to
expect
any
repetition
of
the
payment
under
these
circumstances
what
should
he
do
two
or
three
things
occurred
to
him
but
he
resolved
at
last
to
keep
the
check
without
cashing
it
for
some
weeks
and
then
to
write
to
his
uncle
when
the
fury
of
his
wrath
might
be
supposed
to
have
passed
by
offering
to
restore
it
his
uncle
was
undoubtedly
a
very
silly
man
but
he
was
not
one
who
could
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
had
done
an
unjust
act
without
suffering
for
it
at
the
present
moment
while
his
wrath
was
hot
there
would
be
no
sense
of
contrition
his
ears
would
still
tingle
with
the
sound
of
the
laughter
of
which
he
had
supposed
himself
to
have
been
the
subject
at
the
rectory
but
that
sound
in
a
few
weeks
might
die
away
and
some
feeling
of
the
propriety
of
justice
would
come
back
upon
the
poor
man
mind
such
was
the
state
of
things
upon
which
harry
resolved
to
wait
for
a
few
weeks
but
in
the
mean
time
tidings
came
across
from
the
hall
that
prosper
was
ill
he
had
remained
in
the
house
for
two
or
three
days
after
miss
thoroughbung
visit
this
had
given
rise
to
no
special
remarks
because
it
was
well
known
that
prosper
was
a
man
whose
feelings
were
often
too
many
for
him
when
he
was
annoyed
it
would
be
long
before
he
would
get
the
better
of
the
annoyance
and
during
such
periods
he
would
remain
silent
and
alone
there
could
be
no
question
that
miss
thoroughbung
had
annoyed
him
most
excessively
and
matthew
had
been
aware
that
it
would
be
better
that
he
should
abstain
from
all
questions
he
would
take
the
daily
newspaper
in
to
his
master
and
ask
for
orders
as
to
the
daily
dinner
and
that
would
be
all
prosper
when
in
a
fairly
good
humor
would
see
the
cook
every
morning
and
would
discuss
with
her
the
propriety
of
either
roasting
or
boiling
the
fowl
and
the
expediency
either
of
the
pudding
or
the
pie
his
idiosyncrasies
were
well
known
and
the
cook
might
always
have
her
own
way
by
recommending
the
contrary
to
that
which
she
wanted
because
it
was
a
point
of
honor
with
prosper
not
to
be
led
by
his
servants
but
during
these
days
he
simply
said
let
me
have
dinner
and
do
not
trouble
me
this
went
on
for
a
day
or
two
without
exciting
much
comment
at
the
rectory
but
when
it
went
on
beyond
a
day
or
two
it
was
surmised
that
prosper
was
at
the
end
of
a
week
he
had
not
been
seen
outside
the
house
and
then
alarm
began
to
be
felt
the
rumor
had
got
abroad
that
he
intended
to
go
to
italy
and
it
was
expected
that
he
would
start
but
no
sign
came
of
his
intended
movements
not
a
word
more
had
been
said
to
matthew
on
the
subject
he
had
been
ordered
to
admit
no
visitor
into
the
house
at
all
unless
it
were
some
one
from
the
firm
of
grey
barry
from
the
moment
in
which
he
had
got
rid
of
miss
thoroughbung
he
had
been
subject
to
some
dread
lest
she
should
return
or
if
not
she
herself
she
might
he
thought
send
soames
simpson
or
some
denizen
from
the
brewery
and
he
was
conscious
that
not
only
all
buston
but
all
buntingford
was
aware
of
what
he
had
attempted
to
do
every
one
whom
he
chanced
to
meet
would
as
he
thought
be
talking
of
him
and
therefore
he
feared
to
be
seen
by
the
eye
of
man
woman
or
child
there
was
a
about
him
which
altogether
overpowered
him
that
cook
with
whom
he
used
to
have
the
arguments
about
the
boiled
chicken
was
now
an
enemy
a
domestic
enemy
because
he
was
sure
that
she
talked
about
his
projected
marriage
in
the
kitchen
he
would
not
see
his
coachman
or
his
groom
because
some
tidings
would
have
reached
them
about
that
pair
of
ponies
consequently
he
shut
himself
up
altogether
and
the
disease
became
worse
with
him
because
of
his
seclusion
and
now
from
day
to
day
or
it
may
be
more
properly
said
from
hour
to
hour
news
came
across
to
the
rectory
of
the
poor
squire
health
matthew
to
whom
alone
was
given
free
intercourse
with
his
master
became
very
gloomy
prosper
was
no
doubt
gloomy
and
the
feeling
was
contagious
i
think
he
going
off
his
head
that
what
i
do
think
he
said
in
confidential
intercourse
with
the
cook
that
conversation
resulted
in
matthew
walking
across
to
the
rectory
and
asking
advice
from
the
rector
and
in
the
rector
paying
a
visit
to
the
hall
he
had
again
consulted
with
his
wife
and
she
had
recommended
him
to
endeavor
to
see
her
brother
of
course
what
we
hear
about
his
anger
only
comes
from
joe
or
through
the
servants
if
he
is
angry
what
will
it
matter
not
in
the
least
to
me
said
the
rector
only
i
would
not
willingly
trouble
him
i
would
go
said
the
rector
wife
only
i
know
he
would
require
me
to
agree
with
him
about
harry
that
of
course
i
can
not
do
then
the
rector
walked
across
to
the
hall
and
sent
up
word
by
matthew
that
he
was
there
and
would
be
glad
to
see
prosper
if
prosper
were
disengaged
but
matthew
after
an
interval
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
came
back
with
merely
a
note
i
am
not
very
well
and
an
interview
at
the
present
moment
would
only
be
depressing
but
i
would
be
glad
to
see
my
sister
if
she
would
come
across
at
twelve
i
think
it
would
be
well
that
i
should
see
some
one
and
she
is
now
the
then
there
arose
a
great
discussion
at
the
rectory
as
to
what
this
note
indicated
she
is
now
the
nearest
he
might
have
so
written
had
the
doctor
who
attended
him
told
him
that
death
was
imminent
of
course
she
was
the
nearest
what
did
the
now
mean
was
it
not
intended
to
signify
that
harry
had
been
his
heir
and
therefore
the
nearest
but
that
now
he
had
been
repudiated
but
it
was
of
course
resolved
that
annesley
should
go
to
the
hall
at
the
hour
indicated
on
the
morrow
oh
yes
i
up
here
where
else
should
i
be
unless
you
expected
to
find
me
in
my
bed
it
was
thus
that
he
answered
his
sister
first
inquiry
as
to
his
condition
in
bed
oh
no
why
should
any
one
expect
to
find
you
in
bed
peter
never
call
me
by
that
name
again
he
said
rising
up
from
his
chair
and
standing
erect
with
one
arm
stretched
out
she
called
him
peter
simply
because
it
had
been
her
custom
so
to
do
during
the
period
of
nearly
fifty
years
in
which
they
had
lived
in
the
same
parish
as
brother
and
sister
she
could
therefore
only
stare
at
him
and
his
tragic
humor
as
he
stood
there
before
her
though
of
course
it
is
madness
on
my
part
to
object
to
it
my
godfather
and
godmother
christened
me
peter
and
our
father
was
peter
before
me
and
his
father
too
was
peter
prosper
but
that
woman
has
made
the
name
sound
abominable
in
my
ears
miss
thoroughbung
you
mean
she
came
here
and
so
me
in
my
own
house
nay
up
in
this
very
room
that
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
was
on
my
head
or
my
heels
i
would
not
mind
what
she
said
they
all
know
that
she
is
a
little
flighty
nobody
told
me
so
why
could
you
let
me
know
that
she
was
flighty
beforehand
i
thought
that
she
was
a
person
whom
it
would
have
done
to
marry
if
you
will
only
think
of
it
peter
here
he
shuddered
visibly
i
beg
your
pardon
i
will
not
call
you
so
again
but
it
is
unreasonable
to
blame
us
for
not
telling
you
about
miss
thoroughbung
of
course
it
is
i
am
unreasonable
i
know
it
let
us
hope
that
it
is
all
over
now
would
drag
me
up
to
the
hymeneal
altar
at
least
not
with
that
woman
you
have
sent
for
me
peter
i
beg
pardon
i
was
so
glad
when
you
sent
i
would
have
come
before
only
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
be
annoyed
is
there
anything
that
we
can
do
for
you
nothing
at
all
that
you
can
do
i
fear
somebody
told
us
that
you
were
thinking
of
going
abroad
here
he
shook
his
head
i
think
it
was
harry
here
he
shook
his
head
and
frowned
had
you
not
some
idea
of
going
abroad
that
is
all
gone
he
said
solemnly
it
would
have
enabled
you
to
get
over
this
disappointment
without
feeling
it
so
acutely
i
do
feel
it
but
not
exactly
the
disappointment
there
i
think
i
have
been
saved
from
a
misfortune
which
would
certainly
have
driven
me
mad
that
woman
voice
daily
in
my
ear
could
have
had
no
other
effect
i
have
at
any
rate
been
saved
from
that
what
is
it
then
that
troubles
you
everybody
knows
that
i
intended
it
all
the
country
has
heard
of
it
but
yet
was
not
my
purpose
a
good
one
why
should
not
a
gentleman
marry
if
he
wants
to
leave
his
estate
to
his
own
son
of
course
he
must
marry
before
he
can
do
that
where
was
i
to
get
a
young
lady
just
outside
of
my
own
class
there
was
miss
puffle
i
did
think
of
her
but
just
at
the
moment
she
went
off
with
young
tazlehurst
that
was
another
misfortune
why
should
miss
puffle
have
descended
so
low
just
before
i
had
thought
of
her
and
i
could
marry
quite
a
young
girl
how
could
i
expect
such
a
one
to
live
here
with
me
at
buston
where
it
is
rather
dull
when
i
looked
about
there
was
nobody
except
that
horrid
miss
thoroughbung
you
just
look
about
and
tell
me
if
there
was
any
one
else
of
course
my
circle
is
circumscribed
i
have
been
very
careful
whom
i
have
admitted
to
my
intimacy
and
the
result
is
that
i
know
almost
nobody
i
may
say
that
i
was
driven
to
ask
miss
thoroughbung
but
why
marry
at
all
unless
you
fond
of
somebody
to
be
attached
to
ah
why
marry
at
all
i
say
i
ask
the
question
knowing
very
well
why
you
intended
to
do
it
then
why
do
you
ask
he
said
angrily
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
talk
of
harry
to
you
of
course
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
you
have
injured
him
it
is
he
that
has
injured
me
it
is
he
that
has
brought
me
to
this
condition
do
you
know
that
you
all
been
laughing
at
me
down
at
the
rectory
since
this
affair
of
that
terrible
woman
while
he
paused
for
an
answer
to
his
question
annesley
sat
silent
you
know
it
is
true
he
and
that
man
whom
molly
means
to
marry
and
the
other
girls
and
their
father
and
you
have
all
been
laughing
at
me
i
have
never
laughed
but
the
others
and
again
he
waited
for
a
reply
but
the
no
reply
which
came
did
as
well
as
any
other
answer
there
was
the
fact
that
he
had
been
ridiculed
by
the
very
young
man
whom
it
was
intended
that
he
should
support
by
his
liberality
it
was
impossible
to
tell
him
that
a
man
who
had
made
himself
so
absurd
must
expect
to
be
laughed
at
by
his
juniors
there
was
running
through
his
mind
an
idea
that
very
much
was
due
to
him
from
harry
but
there
was
also
an
idea
that
something
too
was
due
from
him
there
was
present
even
to
him
a
noble
feeling
that
he
should
bear
all
the
ignominy
with
which
he
was
treated
and
still
be
generous
but
he
had
sworn
to
himself
and
had
sworn
to
matthew
that
he
would
never
forgive
his
nephew
of
course
you
all
wish
me
to
be
out
of
the
way
why
do
you
say
that
because
it
is
true
how
happy
you
would
all
be
if
i
were
dead
and
harry
were
living
here
in
my
place
do
you
think
so
yes
i
do
of
course
you
would
all
go
into
mourning
and
there
would
be
some
grimace
of
sorrow
among
you
for
a
few
weeks
but
the
sorrow
would
soon
be
turned
into
joy
i
shall
not
last
long
and
then
his
time
will
come
there
you
may
tell
him
that
his
allowance
shall
be
continued
in
spite
of
all
his
laughing
it
was
for
that
purpose
that
i
sent
for
you
and
now
you
know
it
you
can
go
and
leave
me
then
annesley
did
go
and
rejoiced
them
all
up
at
the
rectory
by
these
latest
tidings
from
the
hall
but
now
the
feeling
was
how
could
they
show
their
gratitude
and
kindness
to
poor
uncle
prosper
chapter
lii
barry
again
barry
has
given
me
to
understand
that
he
means
to
come
down
this
was
said
by
grey
to
his
daughter
what
does
he
want
to
come
here
for
i
suppose
you
know
why
he
wants
to
come
here
then
the
father
was
silent
and
for
some
time
dolly
remained
silent
also
he
is
coming
to
ask
you
to
consent
to
be
his
wife
why
do
you
let
him
come
papa
i
can
not
hinder
him
that
in
the
first
place
and
then
i
do
want
to
prevent
his
coming
oh
papa
i
do
not
want
to
prevent
his
coming
and
i
do
not
wish
you
now
at
this
instant
to
pledge
yourself
to
anything
i
can
not
but
pledge
myself
you
can
at
any
rate
remain
silent
while
i
speak
to
you
there
was
a
solemnity
in
his
manner
which
almost
awed
her
so
that
she
could
only
come
nearer
to
him
and
sit
close
to
him
holding
his
hand
in
hers
i
wish
you
to
hear
what
i
have
got
to
say
to
you
and
to
make
no
answer
till
you
shall
make
it
to
him
after
having
fully
considered
the
whole
matter
in
the
first
place
he
is
an
honest
and
good
man
and
certainly
will
not
you
is
that
so
much
it
is
a
great
deal
as
men
go
it
would
be
a
great
deal
to
me
to
be
sure
that
i
had
left
you
in
the
hands
of
one
who
is
of
his
nature
tender
and
affectionate
that
is
something
but
not
enough
and
then
he
is
a
careful
man
who
will
certainly
screen
you
from
all
want
and
he
is
prudent
walking
about
the
world
with
his
eyes
open
much
wider
than
your
father
has
ever
done
here
she
only
pressed
his
hand
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
against
him
except
that
something
which
you
spotted
at
once
when
you
said
that
he
was
not
a
gentleman
according
to
your
ideas
and
to
mine
he
is
not
quite
a
gentleman
but
we
are
both
fastidious
we
must
pay
the
penalty
of
our
tastes
in
that
respect
you
are
paying
the
penalty
now
by
your
present
doubts
but
it
is
not
yet
too
late
for
you
to
get
the
better
of
it
though
i
have
acknowledged
that
he
is
not
quite
a
gentleman
he
is
by
no
means
the
reverse
you
are
quite
a
lady
i
hope
so
but
you
are
not
particularly
papa
you
are
not
complimentary
my
dear
i
do
not
intend
to
be
so
to
me
your
face
such
as
it
is
is
the
sweetest
thing
on
earth
to
look
upon
oh
papa
dear
papa
and
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
but
having
lived
so
long
with
me
you
have
acquired
my
habits
and
thoughts
and
have
learned
to
disregard
utterly
your
outward
appearance
i
would
be
decent
and
clean
and
womanly
that
is
not
enough
to
attract
the
eyes
of
men
in
general
but
he
has
seen
deeper
than
most
men
do
into
the
value
of
the
business
you
mean
said
she
no
dolly
i
will
not
have
that
that
is
and
as
i
believe
altogether
untrue
i
think
of
barry
that
he
would
not
marry
any
girl
for
the
sake
of
the
business
unless
he
loved
her
that
is
nonsense
papa
how
can
barry
love
me
did
he
and
i
ever
have
five
minutes
of
free
conversation
together
unless
he
meant
to
love
would
be
nearer
the
mark
and
knew
that
he
could
do
so
you
will
be
quite
safe
in
his
hands
safe
papa
so
much
for
yourself
and
now
i
must
say
a
few
words
as
to
myself
you
are
not
bound
to
marry
him
or
any
one
else
to
do
me
a
good
turn
but
i
think
you
are
bound
to
remember
what
my
feelings
would
be
if
on
my
i
were
leaving
you
quite
alone
in
the
world
as
far
as
money
is
concerned
you
would
have
enough
for
all
your
wants
but
that
is
all
that
you
would
have
you
have
become
so
thoroughly
my
friend
that
you
have
hardly
another
real
friend
in
the
world
that
is
my
disposition
yes
but
i
must
guard
against
the
of
that
disposition
i
know
that
if
some
man
came
the
way
whom
you
could
in
truth
love
you
would
make
the
sweetest
wife
that
ever
a
man
possessed
oh
papa
how
you
talk
no
such
man
will
come
the
way
and
there
an
end
of
it
barry
has
come
the
way
and
as
things
go
is
deserving
of
your
regard
my
advice
to
you
is
to
accept
him
now
you
will
have
hours
to
think
of
that
advice
and
to
think
of
your
own
future
condition
how
will
life
go
with
you
if
you
should
be
left
living
in
this
house
all
alone
why
do
you
speak
as
though
we
were
to
be
parted
or
next
day
he
said
very
solemnly
the
day
will
surely
come
before
long
barry
may
not
be
all
that
your
fancy
has
imagined
decidedly
not
but
he
has
those
good
qualities
which
your
reason
should
appreciate
think
it
over
my
darling
and
now
we
will
say
nothing
more
about
barry
till
he
shall
have
been
here
and
pleaded
his
own
cause
then
there
was
not
another
word
said
on
the
subject
between
them
and
on
the
next
morning
grey
went
away
to
his
chambers
as
usual
though
she
had
strenuously
opposed
her
father
through
the
whole
of
the
conversation
above
given
still
as
it
had
gone
on
she
had
resolved
to
do
as
he
would
her
not
indeed
that
is
to
marry
this
suitor
but
to
turn
him
over
in
her
mind
yet
once
again
and
find
out
whether
it
would
be
possible
that
she
should
do
so
she
had
dismissed
him
on
that
former
occasion
and
had
not
since
given
a
thought
to
him
except
as
to
a
nuisance
of
which
she
had
so
far
ridded
herself
now
the
nuisance
had
come
again
and
she
was
to
endeavor
to
ascertain
how
far
she
could
accustom
herself
to
its
perpetual
presence
without
incurring
perpetual
misery
but
it
has
to
be
acknowledged
that
she
did
not
begin
the
inquiry
in
a
fair
frame
of
mind
she
declared
to
herself
that
she
would
think
about
it
all
the
night
and
all
the
morning
without
a
prejudice
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
accept
him
if
she
found
it
possible
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
present
to
her
a
high
black
stone
wall
at
one
side
of
which
stood
she
herself
while
barry
was
on
the
other
that
there
should
be
any
clambering
over
that
wall
by
either
of
them
she
felt
to
be
quite
impossible
though
at
the
same
time
she
acknowledged
that
a
miracle
might
occur
by
which
the
wall
would
be
removed
so
she
began
her
thinking
and
used
all
her
father
arguments
barry
was
honest
and
good
and
would
not
her
she
knew
nothing
about
him
but
would
take
all
that
for
granted
as
though
it
were
gospel
because
her
father
had
said
so
and
then
it
was
to
her
a
fact
that
she
was
by
no
means
the
meaning
of
which
was
that
no
other
man
would
probably
want
her
then
she
remembered
her
words
to
me
your
face
is
the
sweetest
thing
on
earth
to
look
upon
this
she
did
believe
her
plainness
did
not
come
against
her
there
why
should
she
rob
her
father
of
the
one
thing
which
to
him
was
sweet
in
the
world
and
to
her
her
father
was
the
one
noble
human
being
whom
she
had
ever
known
why
should
she
rob
herself
of
his
daily
presence
then
she
told
herself
as
she
had
told
him
that
she
had
never
had
five
minutes
free
conversation
with
barry
in
her
life
that
certainly
was
no
reason
why
free
conversation
should
not
be
commenced
but
then
she
did
not
believe
that
free
conversation
was
within
the
capacity
of
barry
it
would
never
come
though
she
might
be
married
to
him
for
twenty
years
he
too
might
perhaps
talk
about
his
business
but
there
would
be
none
of
those
considerations
as
to
radical
good
or
evil
which
made
the
nucleus
of
all
such
conversations
with
her
father
there
would
be
a
flatness
about
it
all
which
would
make
any
such
interchange
of
words
impossible
it
would
be
as
though
she
had
been
married
to
a
log
of
wood
or
rather
a
beast
of
the
field
as
regarded
all
sentiment
how
much
money
would
be
coming
to
him
now
her
father
had
never
told
her
how
much
money
was
coming
to
him
there
had
been
no
allusion
to
that
branch
of
the
subject
and
then
there
came
other
thoughts
as
to
that
interior
life
which
it
would
be
her
destiny
to
lead
with
barry
then
came
a
black
cloud
upon
her
face
as
she
sat
thinking
of
it
never
at
last
she
said
never
never
he
is
very
foolish
not
to
know
that
it
is
impossible
the
he
of
whom
she
then
spoke
was
her
father
and
not
barry
if
i
have
to
be
left
alone
i
shall
not
be
the
first
others
have
been
left
alone
before
me
i
shall
at
any
rate
be
left
alone
then
the
wall
became
higher
and
more
black
than
ever
and
there
was
no
coming
of
that
miracle
by
which
it
was
to
be
removed
it
was
clearer
to
her
than
ever
that
neither
of
them
could
climb
it
and
after
all
she
said
to
herself
to
know
that
your
husband
is
not
a
gentleman
ought
that
not
to
be
enough
of
course
a
woman
has
to
pay
for
her
fastidiousness
like
other
luxuries
it
is
costly
but
then
like
other
luxuries
it
can
not
be
laid
aside
so
before
that
morning
was
gone
she
made
up
her
mind
steadily
that
barry
should
never
be
her
lord
and
master
how
could
she
best
make
him
understand
that
it
was
so
so
that
she
might
be
quickly
rid
of
him
when
the
first
hour
of
thinking
was
done
after
breakfast
it
was
that
which
filled
her
mind
she
was
sure
that
he
would
not
take
an
answer
easily
and
go
he
would
have
been
prepared
by
her
father
to
persevere
not
by
his
absolute
words
but
by
his
mode
of
speaking
her
father
would
have
given
him
to
understand
that
she
was
still
in
doubt
and
therefore
might
possibly
be
talked
over
she
must
teach
him
at
once
as
well
as
she
could
that
such
was
not
her
character
and
that
she
had
come
to
a
resolution
which
left
him
no
chance
and
she
was
guilty
of
one
weakness
which
was
almost
unworthy
of
her
when
the
time
came
she
changed
her
dress
and
put
on
an
old
shabby
frock
in
which
she
was
wont
to
call
upon
the
carrolls
her
best
dresses
were
all
kept
for
her
father
and
perhaps
accounted
for
that
opinion
that
to
his
eyes
her
face
was
the
sweetest
thing
on
earth
to
look
upon
as
she
sat
there
waiting
for
barry
she
certainly
did
look
ten
years
older
than
her
age
in
truth
both
grey
and
dolly
had
been
somewhat
mistaken
in
their
reading
of
barry
character
there
was
more
of
intellect
and
merit
in
him
than
he
had
obtained
credit
for
from
either
of
them
he
did
care
very
much
for
the
income
of
the
business
and
perhaps
his
first
idea
in
looking
for
dolly
hand
had
been
the
probability
that
he
would
thus
obtain
the
whole
of
that
income
for
himself
but
while
wanting
money
he
wanted
also
some
of
the
good
things
which
ought
to
accompany
it
a
superior
intellect
an
intellect
slightly
superior
to
his
own
of
which
he
did
not
think
meanly
a
power
of
conversation
which
he
might
imitate
and
that
fineness
of
thought
which
he
flattered
himself
he
might
be
able
to
achieve
while
living
with
the
daughter
of
a
gentleman
these
were
the
treasures
which
barry
hoped
to
gain
by
his
marriage
with
dorothy
grey
and
there
had
been
something
in
her
personal
appearance
which
to
his
eyes
had
not
been
distasteful
he
did
not
think
her
face
the
sweetest
thing
in
the
world
to
look
at
as
her
father
had
done
but
he
saw
in
it
the
index
of
that
intellect
which
he
had
desired
to
obtain
for
himself
as
for
her
dress
that
of
course
should
all
be
altered
he
imagined
that
he
could
easily
become
so
far
master
of
his
wife
as
to
make
her
wear
fine
clothes
without
difficulty
but
then
he
did
not
know
dolly
grey
he
had
studied
deeply
his
manner
of
attacking
her
he
would
be
very
humble
at
first
but
after
a
while
his
humility
should
be
discontinued
whether
she
accepted
or
rejected
him
he
knew
well
that
it
did
not
become
a
husband
to
be
humble
and
as
regarded
a
lover
he
thought
that
humility
was
merely
the
outside
gloss
of
he
had
been
humble
enough
on
the
former
occasion
and
would
begin
now
in
the
same
strain
but
after
a
while
he
would
stir
himself
and
assume
the
manner
of
a
man
miss
grey
he
said
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
you
see
that
i
have
been
as
good
as
my
word
and
have
come
again
he
had
already
observed
her
old
frock
and
her
mode
of
dressing
up
her
hair
and
had
guessed
the
truth
i
knew
that
you
were
to
come
mr
barry
your
father
has
told
you
so
yes
and
he
has
spoken
a
good
word
in
my
favor
yes
he
has
which
i
trust
will
be
effective
not
at
all
he
knows
that
it
is
the
only
subject
on
which
i
can
not
take
his
advice
i
would
burn
my
hand
off
for
my
father
but
i
can
not
afford
to
give
it
to
any
one
at
his
instance
it
must
be
exclusively
my
own
unless
some
one
should
come
very
different
from
those
who
are
likely
to
ask
for
it
there
was
something
barry
thought
of
offence
in
this
but
he
could
not
altogether
throw
off
his
humility
as
yet
i
quite
admit
the
value
of
the
treasure
he
said
there
need
not
be
any
nonsense
between
us
barry
it
has
no
special
value
to
any
one
except
to
myself
but
to
myself
i
mean
to
keep
it
at
my
father
instance
i
had
thought
over
the
proposition
you
have
made
me
much
more
seriously
than
i
had
thought
it
possible
that
i
should
do
that
is
not
flattering
he
said
there
is
no
need
for
flattery
either
on
the
one
side
or
on
the
other
you
had
better
take
that
as
established
you
have
done
me
the
honor
of
wishing
for
certain
reasons
that
i
should
be
your
wife
the
common
reason
that
i
love
you
but
i
am
not
able
to
return
the
feeling
and
do
not
therefore
wish
that
you
should
be
my
husband
that
sounds
to
be
uncivil
rather
but
i
say
it
in
order
to
make
you
understand
the
exact
truth
a
woman
can
not
love
a
man
because
she
feels
for
him
even
the
most
profound
respect
she
will
often
do
so
when
there
is
neither
respect
nor
esteem
my
father
has
so
spoken
of
you
to
me
that
i
do
esteem
you
but
that
has
no
effect
in
touching
my
heart
therefore
i
can
not
become
your
wife
now
as
barry
thought
had
come
the
time
in
which
he
must
assert
himself
miss
grey
he
said
you
have
probably
a
long
life
before
you
long
or
short
it
can
make
no
difference
if
i
understood
you
aright
you
are
one
who
lives
very
much
to
yourself
to
myself
and
my
father
he
is
growing
in
years
so
am
i
for
the
matter
of
that
we
are
all
growing
in
years
have
you
looked
out
for
yourself
and
thought
what
manner
of
home
yours
will
be
when
he
shall
have
been
dead
and
buried
he
paused
but
she
remained
silent
and
assumed
a
special
cast
of
countenance
as
though
she
might
say
a
word
if
he
pressed
her
which
it
would
be
disagreeable
for
him
to
hear
when
he
has
gone
will
you
not
be
very
solitary
without
a
husband
no
doubt
i
shall
had
you
not
better
accept
one
when
one
comes
your
way
who
is
not
as
he
tells
you
quite
unworthy
of
you
in
spite
of
such
worth
solitude
would
be
preferable
you
certainly
have
a
knack
miss
grey
of
making
the
most
unpalatable
assertions
i
will
make
another
more
unpalatable
solitude
i
could
bear
and
death
but
not
such
a
marriage
you
force
me
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
because
half
a
truth
will
not
suffice
i
have
endeavored
to
be
at
any
rate
civil
to
you
he
said
and
i
have
endeavored
to
save
you
what
trouble
i
could
by
being
straightforward
still
he
paused
sitting
in
his
chair
uneasily
but
looking
as
though
he
had
no
intention
of
going
if
you
will
only
take
me
at
my
word
and
have
done
with
it
still
he
did
not
move
i
suppose
there
are
young
ladies
who
like
this
kind
of
thing
but
i
have
become
old
enough
to
hate
it
i
have
had
very
little
experience
of
it
but
it
is
odious
to
me
i
can
conceive
nothing
more
disagreeable
than
to
have
to
sit
still
and
hear
a
gentleman
declare
that
he
wants
to
make
me
his
wife
when
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
do
not
intend
to
make
him
my
husband
then
miss
grey
he
said
rising
from
his
chair
suddenly
i
shall
bid
you
adieu
mr
barry
miss
grey
farewell
and
so
he
went
oh
papa
we
have
had
such
a
scene
she
said
the
moment
she
felt
herself
alone
with
her
father
you
have
not
accepted
him
accepted
him
oh
dear
no
i
am
sure
at
this
moment
he
is
only
thinking
how
he
would
cut
my
throat
if
he
could
get
hold
of
me
you
must
have
offended
him
then
very
greatly
oh
mortally
i
said
everything
i
possibly
could
to
offend
him
but
then
he
would
have
been
here
still
had
i
not
done
so
there
was
no
other
way
to
get
rid
of
him
or
indeed
to
make
him
believe
that
i
was
in
earnest
i
am
sorry
that
you
should
have
been
so
ungracious
of
course
i
am
ungracious
but
how
can
you
stand
bandying
compliments
with
a
man
when
it
is
your
object
to
make
him
know
the
very
truth
that
is
in
you
it
was
your
fault
papa
you
ought
to
have
understood
how
very
impossible
it
is
that
i
should
marry
mr
barry
chapter
liii
the
beginning
of
the
last
plot
when
scarborough
had
written
the
check
and
sent
it
to
grey
he
did
not
utter
another
word
on
the
subject
of
gambling
let
us
make
another
beginning
he
said
as
he
told
his
son
to
make
out
another
check
for
sixty
pounds
as
his
first
instalment
of
the
allowance
i
do
not
like
to
take
it
said
the
son
i
do
think
you
need
be
scrupulous
now
with
me
that
was
early
in
the
morning
at
their
first
interview
about
ten
later
on
in
the
day
scarborough
saw
his
son
again
and
on
this
occasion
kept
him
in
the
room
some
time
i
do
suppose
i
shall
last
much
longer
now
he
said
your
voice
is
as
strong
as
i
ever
heard
it
but
unfortunately
my
body
does
not
keep
pace
with
my
voice
from
what
merton
says
i
do
suppose
there
is
above
a
month
left
i
do
see
why
merton
is
to
know
merton
is
a
good
fellow
and
if
you
can
do
anything
for
him
do
it
for
my
sake
i
will
then
he
added
after
a
pause
if
things
go
as
we
expect
augustus
can
do
more
for
him
than
i
why
do
you
leave
him
a
sum
of
money
then
miss
scarborough
came
into
the
room
and
hovered
about
her
brother
and
fed
him
and
entreated
him
to
be
silent
but
when
she
had
gone
he
went
back
to
the
subject
i
will
tell
you
why
mountjoy
i
have
not
wished
to
load
my
will
with
other
considerations
so
that
it
might
be
seen
that
solicitude
for
you
has
been
in
my
last
moments
my
only
thought
of
course
i
have
done
you
a
deep
injury
i
think
you
have
and
because
you
tell
me
so
i
like
you
all
the
better
as
for
augustus
but
i
will
not
burden
my
spirit
now
at
the
last
with
uttering
curses
against
my
own
son
he
is
not
worth
it
no
he
is
not
worth
it
what
a
fool
he
has
been
not
to
have
understood
me
better
now
you
are
not
half
as
clever
a
fellow
as
he
is
i
dare
say
not
you
never
read
a
book
i
suppose
i
do
pretend
to
read
them
which
he
does
i
do
know
anything
about
that
but
he
has
been
utterly
unable
to
read
me
i
have
poured
out
my
money
with
open
hands
for
both
of
you
that
is
true
sir
certainly
as
regards
me
and
have
thought
nothing
of
it
till
it
was
quite
hopeless
with
you
i
went
on
and
would
have
gone
on
as
things
were
then
i
was
bound
to
do
something
to
save
the
property
these
poor
devils
have
put
themselves
out
of
the
running
now
said
mountjoy
yes
augustus
with
his
suspicions
has
enabled
us
to
do
that
after
all
he
was
quite
right
with
his
suspicions
what
do
you
mean
by
that
sir
well
it
was
natural
enough
that
he
should
not
trust
me
i
think
too
that
perhaps
he
saw
a
screw
loose
where
old
grey
did
not
but
he
was
such
an
ass
that
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
keep
on
good
terms
with
me
for
the
few
months
that
were
left
and
then
he
brought
that
brute
jones
down
here
without
saying
a
word
to
me
as
to
asking
my
leave
and
here
he
used
to
remain
hardly
ever
coming
to
see
me
but
waiting
for
my
death
from
day
to
day
he
is
a
selfish
brute
he
certainly
takes
after
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
but
he
will
find
yet
perhaps
that
i
am
even
with
him
before
all
is
over
i
shall
try
it
on
with
him
sir
i
have
told
you
so
from
the
beginning
and
now
if
i
have
this
money
it
will
give
me
the
means
of
doing
so
you
ought
to
know
for
what
purpose
i
shall
use
it
that
is
all
settled
said
the
father
the
document
properly
completed
has
gone
back
with
the
clerk
were
i
to
die
this
minute
you
would
find
that
everything
inside
the
house
is
your
own
and
everything
outside
except
the
bare
acres
there
is
a
lot
of
plate
with
the
banker
which
i
have
not
wanted
of
late
years
and
there
are
a
lot
of
trinkets
too
things
which
i
used
to
fancy
though
i
have
not
cared
so
much
about
them
lately
and
there
are
a
few
pictures
which
are
worth
money
but
the
books
are
the
most
valuable
only
you
do
not
care
for
them
i
shall
not
have
a
house
to
put
them
in
there
is
no
saying
what
an
idiot
what
a
fool
what
a
blind
unthinking
ass
augustus
has
been
do
you
regret
it
sir
that
he
should
not
have
them
and
the
house
too
i
regret
that
my
son
should
have
been
such
a
fool
i
did
not
expect
that
he
should
love
me
i
did
not
even
want
him
to
be
kind
to
me
had
he
remained
away
and
been
silent
that
would
have
been
sufficient
but
he
came
here
to
enjoy
himself
as
he
looked
about
the
park
which
he
thought
to
be
his
own
and
insulted
me
because
i
would
not
die
at
once
and
leave
him
in
possession
and
then
he
was
fool
enough
to
make
way
for
you
again
and
did
not
perceive
that
by
getting
rid
of
your
creditors
he
once
again
put
you
into
a
position
to
be
his
rival
i
do
know
whether
i
hate
him
most
for
the
hardness
of
his
heart
or
despise
him
for
the
slowness
of
his
intellect
during
the
time
that
these
words
had
been
spoken
miss
scarborough
had
once
or
twice
come
into
the
room
and
besought
her
brother
to
take
some
refreshment
which
she
offered
him
and
then
give
himself
up
to
rest
but
he
had
refused
to
be
guided
by
her
till
he
had
come
to
a
point
in
the
conversation
at
which
he
had
found
himself
thoroughly
exhausted
now
she
came
for
the
third
time
and
that
period
had
arrived
so
that
mountjoy
was
told
to
go
about
his
business
and
shoot
birds
or
hunt
foxes
in
accordance
with
his
natural
proclivities
it
was
then
three
on
a
gloomy
december
afternoon
and
was
too
late
for
the
shooting
of
birds
and
as
for
the
hunting
of
foxes
the
hounds
were
not
in
the
neighborhood
so
he
resolved
to
go
through
the
house
and
look
at
all
those
properties
which
were
so
soon
to
become
his
own
and
he
at
once
strolled
into
the
library
this
was
a
long
gloomy
room
which
contained
perhaps
ten
thousand
volumes
the
greater
number
of
which
had
in
the
days
of
mountjoy
early
youth
been
brought
together
by
his
own
father
and
they
had
been
bound
in
the
bindings
of
modern
times
so
that
the
shelves
were
bright
although
the
room
itself
was
gloomy
he
took
out
book
after
book
and
told
himself
with
something
of
sadness
in
his
heart
that
they
were
all
caviare
to
him
then
he
reminded
himself
that
he
was
not
yet
thirty
years
of
age
and
that
there
was
surely
time
enough
left
for
him
to
make
them
his
companions
he
took
one
at
random
and
found
it
to
be
a
volume
of
history
of
the
rebellion
he
pitched
upon
a
sentence
in
which
he
counted
that
there
were
sixteen
lines
and
when
he
began
to
read
it
it
became
to
him
utterly
confused
and
unintelligible
so
he
put
it
back
and
went
to
another
portion
of
the
room
and
took
down
hallelujah
and
of
this
he
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
he
was
informed
by
a
heading
in
the
book
itself
that
a
piece
of
poetry
was
to
be
sung
as
the
ten
commandments
he
could
not
do
that
and
put
the
book
back
again
and
declared
to
himself
that
farther
search
would
be
useless
he
looked
round
the
room
and
tried
to
price
the
books
and
told
himself
that
three
or
four
days
at
the
club
might
see
an
end
of
it
all
then
he
wandered
on
into
the
state
an
apartment
which
he
had
not
entered
for
years
and
found
that
all
the
furniture
was
carefully
covered
of
what
use
could
it
all
be
to
him
unless
that
it
too
might
be
sent
to
the
and
brought
into
some
use
at
the
club
but
as
he
was
about
to
leave
the
room
he
stood
for
a
moment
on
the
rug
before
the
fireplace
and
looked
into
the
huge
mirror
which
stood
there
if
the
walls
might
be
his
as
well
as
the
garnishing
of
them
and
if
florence
mountjoy
could
come
and
reign
there
then
he
fancied
that
they
all
might
be
put
to
a
better
purpose
than
that
of
which
he
had
thought
in
earlier
days
two
or
three
years
ago
at
a
time
which
now
seemed
to
him
to
be
very
distant
he
had
regarded
florence
as
his
own
and
as
such
had
demanded
her
hand
in
the
pride
of
his
birth
and
position
and
fashion
he
had
had
no
thought
of
her
feelings
and
had
been
imperious
he
told
himself
that
it
had
been
so
with
much
at
any
rate
he
had
learned
during
those
months
of
solitary
wandering
the
power
of
condemning
himself
and
now
he
told
him
that
if
she
would
yet
come
he
might
still
learn
to
sing
that
song
of
the
poet
as
to
the
ten
commandments
at
any
rate
he
would
endeavor
to
sing
it
as
she
bade
him
he
went
on
through
all
the
bedrooms
remembering
but
hardly
more
than
remembering
them
as
he
entered
them
oh
florence
my
florence
he
said
as
he
passed
on
he
had
done
it
all
for
himself
brought
down
upon
his
own
head
this
infinite
ruin
and
for
what
he
had
scarcely
ever
won
and
tretton
was
gone
from
him
forever
but
still
there
might
yet
be
a
chance
if
he
could
abstain
from
gambling
and
then
when
it
was
dusk
within
the
house
he
went
out
and
passed
through
the
stables
and
roamed
about
the
gardens
till
the
evening
had
altogether
set
in
and
black
night
had
come
upon
him
two
years
ago
he
had
known
that
he
was
the
heir
to
it
all
though
even
then
that
habit
was
so
strong
upon
him
he
had
felt
that
his
tenure
of
it
would
be
but
slight
but
he
had
then
always
to
tell
himself
that
when
his
marriage
had
taken
place
a
great
change
would
be
effected
his
marriage
had
not
taken
place
and
the
next
fatal
year
had
fallen
upon
him
as
long
as
the
inheritance
of
the
estate
was
certainly
his
he
could
assuredly
raise
money
at
a
certain
cost
it
was
well
known
that
the
property
was
rising
in
value
and
the
money
had
always
been
forthcoming
at
a
tremendous
sacrifice
he
had
excused
to
himself
his
recklessness
on
the
ground
of
his
delayed
marriage
but
still
always
treating
her
on
the
few
occasions
on
which
they
had
met
with
an
imperiousness
which
had
been
natural
to
him
then
the
final
crash
had
come
and
the
estate
was
as
good
as
gone
but
the
crash
which
had
been
in
truth
final
had
come
afterward
almost
as
soon
as
his
father
had
learned
what
was
to
be
the
fate
of
tretton
and
he
had
found
himself
to
be
a
bastard
with
a
dishonored
mother
just
a
nobody
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
he
learned
at
the
same
time
that
harry
annesley
was
the
lover
whom
florence
mountjoy
really
loved
what
had
followed
has
been
told
already
perhaps
too
often
but
at
this
moment
as
he
stood
in
the
gloom
of
the
night
below
the
porch
in
the
front
of
the
house
swinging
his
stick
at
the
top
of
the
big
steps
an
acknowledgment
of
contrition
was
very
heavy
upon
him
though
he
was
prepared
to
go
to
law
the
moment
that
augustus
put
himself
forward
as
the
eldest
son
he
did
recognize
how
his
father
had
been
and
how
much
had
been
done
for
him
in
order
if
possible
to
preserve
him
and
he
knew
whatever
might
be
the
result
of
his
lawsuit
that
his
father
only
purpose
had
been
to
save
the
property
for
one
of
them
as
it
was
legacies
which
might
be
valued
at
perhaps
thirty
thousand
pounds
would
be
his
he
would
expend
it
all
on
the
lawsuit
if
he
could
find
lawyers
to
undertake
his
suit
his
anger
too
against
his
brother
was
quite
as
hot
as
was
that
of
his
father
when
he
had
been
obliterated
and
obliged
to
vanish
from
the
joint
effects
of
his
violence
in
the
streets
and
his
inability
to
pay
his
gambling
debts
at
the
club
he
had
in
an
evil
moment
submitted
himself
to
augustus
and
from
that
hour
augustus
had
become
to
him
the
most
cruel
of
tyrants
and
this
tyranny
had
come
to
an
end
with
his
absolute
banishment
from
his
brother
house
though
he
had
been
subdued
to
obedience
in
the
lowest
moment
of
his
fall
he
was
not
the
man
who
could
bear
such
tyranny
well
i
can
forgive
my
father
he
said
but
augustus
i
will
never
forgive
then
he
went
into
the
house
and
in
a
short
time
was
sitting
at
dinner
with
merton
the
young
doctor
and
secretary
miss
scarborough
seldom
came
to
table
at
that
hour
but
remained
in
a
room
close
to
her
brother
so
that
she
might
be
within
call
should
she
be
wanted
upon
the
whole
merton
he
said
what
do
you
think
of
my
father
the
doctor
shrugged
his
shoulders
will
he
live
or
will
he
die
he
will
die
certainly
do
not
joke
with
me
but
i
know
you
would
not
joke
on
such
a
subject
and
my
question
did
not
merely
go
to
the
state
of
his
health
what
do
you
think
of
him
as
a
man
generally
do
you
call
him
an
honest
man
how
am
i
to
answer
you
just
the
truth
if
you
will
have
an
answer
i
do
not
consider
him
an
honest
man
all
this
story
about
your
brother
is
true
or
is
not
true
in
neither
case
can
one
look
upon
him
as
honest
just
so
but
i
think
that
he
has
within
him
a
capacity
for
love
and
an
unselfishness
which
almost
atones
for
his
dishonesty
and
there
is
about
him
a
strange
dislike
to
conventionality
and
to
law
which
is
so
interesting
as
to
make
up
the
balance
i
have
always
regarded
your
father
as
a
most
excellent
man
but
thoroughly
dishonest
he
would
rob
any
one
but
always
to
eke
out
his
own
gifts
to
other
people
he
has
therefore
to
my
eyes
been
most
romantic
and
as
to
his
health
ah
as
to
that
i
can
not
answer
so
decidedly
he
will
do
nothing
because
i
tell
him
do
you
mean
that
you
could
prolong
his
life
certainly
i
think
that
i
could
he
has
exerted
himself
this
morning
whereas
i
have
advised
him
not
to
exert
himself
he
could
have
given
himself
the
same
counsel
and
would
certainly
live
longer
by
obeying
it
than
the
reverse
as
there
is
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
there
need
be
no
conceit
on
my
part
in
saying
that
so
far
my
advice
might
be
of
service
to
him
how
long
will
he
live
who
can
say
sir
william
brodrick
when
that
fearful
operation
was
performed
in
london
thought
that
a
month
would
see
the
end
of
it
that
is
eight
months
ago
and
he
has
more
vitality
now
than
he
had
then
for
myself
i
do
not
think
that
he
can
live
another
month
later
on
in
the
evening
mountjoy
scarborough
began
again
the
governor
thinks
that
you
have
behaved
uncommonly
well
to
him
i
am
paid
for
it
all
but
he
has
not
left
you
anything
by
his
will
i
have
certainly
expected
nothing
and
there
could
be
no
reason
why
he
should
he
has
entertained
an
idea
of
late
that
he
wishes
to
make
what
reparation
may
be
possible
to
me
and
therefore
as
he
says
he
does
not
choose
to
burden
his
will
with
legacies
there
is
some
provision
made
for
my
aunt
who
however
has
her
own
fortune
he
has
told
me
to
look
after
you
it
will
be
quite
unnecessary
said
merton
if
you
choose
to
cut
up
rough
you
can
do
so
i
would
propose
that
we
should
fix
upon
some
sum
which
shall
be
yours
at
his
death
just
as
though
he
had
left
it
to
you
indeed
he
shall
fix
the
sum
himself
merton
of
course
said
that
nothing
of
the
kind
would
be
necessary
but
with
this
understanding
mountjoy
scarborough
went
that
night
to
bed
early
on
the
following
morning
his
father
again
sent
for
him
mountjoy
he
said
i
have
thought
much
about
it
and
i
have
changed
my
mind
about
your
will
no
not
about
my
will
at
all
that
shall
remain
as
it
is
i
do
not
think
i
should
have
strength
to
make
another
will
nor
do
i
wish
to
do
so
you
mean
about
merton
i
do
mean
about
merton
at
all
give
him
five
hundred
pounds
and
he
ought
to
be
satisfied
this
is
a
matter
of
more
importance
than
merton
or
even
than
my
will
what
is
it
said
mountjoy
in
a
tone
of
much
surprise
i
do
think
i
can
tell
you
now
but
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
that
merton
wrote
by
my
instructions
to
grey
early
this
morning
and
has
implored
him
to
come
to
tretton
once
again
there
i
can
not
say
more
than
that
now
then
he
turned
round
on
his
couch
as
was
his
custom
and
was
unassailable
chapter
liv
rummelsburg
scarborough
again
sent
for
grey
but
a
couple
of
weeks
passed
before
he
came
at
first
he
refused
to
come
saying
that
he
would
send
his
clerk
down
if
any
work
were
wanted
such
as
the
clerk
might
do
and
the
clerk
did
come
and
was
very
useful
but
scarborough
persevered
using
arguments
which
grey
found
himself
unable
at
last
to
resist
he
was
dying
and
there
would
soon
be
an
end
of
it
that
was
his
strongest
argument
then
it
was
alleged
that
a
lawyer
of
experience
was
certainly
needed
and
that
scarborough
could
not
very
well
put
his
affairs
into
the
hands
of
a
stranger
and
old
friendship
was
brought
up
and
then
at
last
the
squire
alleged
that
there
were
other
secrets
to
be
divulged
respecting
his
family
of
which
scarborough
thought
that
grey
would
approve
what
could
be
the
other
secrets
but
it
ended
in
grey
assenting
to
go
in
opposition
to
his
daughter
advice
i
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
him
or
his
secrets
dolly
had
said
you
do
not
know
him
i
know
as
much
about
him
as
a
woman
can
know
of
a
man
she
know
and
all
from
yourself
you
have
said
over
and
over
again
that
he
is
a
not
a
rascal
i
do
think
i
said
he
was
a
rascal
i
believe
you
used
that
very
word
then
i
unsay
it
a
rascal
has
something
mean
about
him
juniper
a
rascal
he
cares
nothing
for
his
word
nothing
at
all
when
the
law
is
concerned
and
he
has
defamed
his
own
wife
that
was
done
many
years
ago
for
a
fixed
purpose
and
not
from
passion
dolly
continued
he
is
a
thoroughly
bad
man
you
have
made
his
will
for
him
and
now
i
would
leave
him
after
that
grey
declined
for
a
second
time
to
go
but
at
last
he
was
persuaded
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
he
dined
with
mountjoy
and
merton
and
on
that
occasion
miss
scarborough
joined
them
of
course
there
was
much
surmise
as
to
the
cause
of
this
farther
visit
merton
declared
that
as
he
had
acted
as
the
sick
man
private
secretary
he
was
bound
to
keep
his
secret
as
far
as
he
knew
it
he
only
surmised
what
he
believed
to
be
the
truth
but
of
that
he
could
say
nothing
miss
scarborough
was
altogether
in
the
dark
she
and
she
alone
spoke
of
her
brother
with
respect
but
in
that
she
knew
nothing
i
can
not
tell
what
it
is
said
mountjoy
but
i
suspect
it
to
be
something
intended
for
my
benefit
and
for
the
utter
ruin
of
augustus
miss
scarborough
had
now
retired
if
it
could
be
possible
i
should
think
that
he
intended
to
declare
that
all
he
had
said
before
was
false
to
this
however
grey
would
not
listen
he
was
very
stout
in
denying
the
possibility
of
any
reversion
of
the
decision
to
which
they
had
all
come
augustus
was
undoubtedly
by
law
his
father
eldest
son
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
copies
of
the
registry
of
the
marriage
which
barry
had
gone
across
the
continent
to
make
and
in
that
book
his
wife
had
signed
her
maiden
name
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
this
had
been
done
in
the
presence
of
the
clergyman
and
of
a
gentleman
a
german
then
residing
on
the
spot
who
had
himself
been
examined
and
had
stated
that
the
wedding
as
a
wedding
had
been
regular
in
all
respects
he
was
since
dead
but
the
clergyman
who
had
married
them
was
still
alive
within
twelve
months
of
that
time
scarborough
and
his
bride
had
arrived
in
england
and
augustus
had
been
born
nothing
but
the
most
indisputable
evidence
would
have
sufficed
to
prove
a
fact
by
which
you
were
so
cruelly
wronged
he
said
addressing
himself
to
mountjoy
and
when
your
father
told
me
that
no
wrong
could
be
done
to
you
as
the
property
was
hopelessly
in
the
hands
of
the
jews
i
told
him
that
for
all
purposes
of
the
law
the
jews
were
as
dear
to
me
as
you
were
i
do
say
that
nothing
but
the
most
certain
facts
would
have
convinced
me
such
facts
when
made
certain
are
immovable
if
your
father
has
any
plot
for
robbing
augustus
he
will
find
me
as
staunch
a
friend
to
augustus
as
ever
i
have
been
to
you
when
he
had
so
spoken
they
separated
for
the
night
and
his
words
had
been
so
strong
that
they
had
altogether
affected
mountjoy
if
such
were
his
father
intentions
it
must
be
by
some
farther
plot
that
he
endeavored
to
carry
it
out
and
in
his
father
plots
he
would
put
no
trust
whatever
and
yet
he
declared
his
own
purpose
as
he
discussed
the
matter
late
into
the
night
with
merton
i
can
not
trust
grey
at
all
nor
my
father
either
because
i
do
not
believe
as
grey
believes
this
story
of
the
marriage
my
father
is
so
clever
and
so
resolute
in
his
purpose
to
set
aside
all
control
over
the
property
as
arranged
by
law
that
to
my
mind
it
has
all
been
contrived
by
himself
either
barry
has
been
squared
or
the
german
parson
or
the
foreign
gentleman
or
more
probably
all
of
them
grey
himself
may
have
been
squared
for
all
i
know
though
he
is
the
gentleman
i
ever
came
across
anything
shall
be
more
probable
to
me
than
that
i
am
not
my
father
eldest
son
to
all
this
merton
said
very
little
though
no
doubt
he
had
his
own
ideas
the
next
morning
the
three
gentlemen
with
grey
clerk
sat
down
to
breakfast
solemn
and
silent
the
clerk
had
been
especially
entreated
to
say
nothing
of
what
he
had
learned
and
was
therefore
not
questioned
by
his
master
but
in
truth
he
had
learned
but
little
having
spent
his
time
in
the
sorting
and
copying
of
letters
which
though
they
all
bore
upon
the
subject
in
hand
told
nothing
of
the
real
tale
farther
surmises
were
useless
now
as
at
eleven
grey
and
merton
were
to
go
up
together
to
the
squire
room
the
clerk
was
to
remain
within
call
but
there
would
be
no
need
of
mountjoy
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
go
to
bed
said
he
or
up
to
london
or
anywhere
grey
very
sententiously
advised
him
at
any
rate
not
to
go
up
to
london
the
hour
came
and
grey
with
merton
and
the
clerk
disappeared
they
were
summoned
by
miss
scarborough
who
seemed
to
feel
heavily
the
awful
solemnity
of
the
occasion
i
am
sure
he
is
going
to
do
something
very
dreadful
this
time
she
whispered
to
grey
who
seemed
himself
to
be
a
little
and
did
not
answer
her
at
two
they
all
met
again
at
lunch
and
grey
was
silent
and
in
truth
very
unhappy
merton
and
the
clerk
were
also
silent
as
was
miss
scarborough
silent
as
death
she
indeed
knew
nothing
but
the
other
three
knew
as
much
as
scarborough
could
or
would
tell
them
mountjoy
was
there
also
and
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
broke
out
violently
why
the
mischief
do
you
tell
me
what
it
is
that
my
father
has
said
to
you
because
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
his
story
said
grey
oh
mr
grey
ejaculated
miss
scarborough
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
his
story
repeated
grey
your
father
intelligence
is
so
high
and
his
principles
so
low
that
there
is
no
scheme
which
he
does
not
think
that
he
can
not
carry
out
against
the
established
laws
of
his
country
his
present
tale
is
a
fable
what
do
you
say
merton
asked
mountjoy
it
looks
to
me
to
be
true
said
merton
but
i
am
no
lawyer
why
do
you
tell
me
what
it
is
said
mountjoy
i
can
not
tell
you
said
grey
though
he
commissioned
me
to
do
so
greenwood
there
will
tell
you
greenwood
was
the
name
of
the
clerk
but
i
advise
you
to
take
him
with
you
to
your
own
room
and
merton
would
i
am
sure
go
with
you
as
for
me
it
would
be
impossible
that
i
should
do
credit
in
the
telling
of
it
to
a
story
of
which
i
do
not
believe
a
single
word
am
i
not
to
know
asked
miss
scarborough
plaintively
your
nephew
will
tell
you
said
grey
or
merton
or
greenwood
can
do
so
if
he
has
permission
from
scarborough
i
would
rather
tell
no
one
it
is
to
me
incredible
with
that
he
got
up
and
walked
away
now
then
merton
said
mountjoy
rising
from
his
chair
upon
my
word
i
hardly
know
what
to
do
said
merton
you
must
come
and
tell
me
this
wonderful
tale
i
suppose
that
in
some
way
it
does
affect
my
interests
it
affects
your
interests
very
much
then
i
think
i
may
say
that
i
certainly
shall
believe
it
my
father
at
present
would
not
wish
to
do
me
an
injury
it
must
be
told
so
come
along
greenwood
had
better
come
also
then
he
left
the
room
and
the
two
men
followed
him
they
went
away
to
the
leaving
grey
with
miss
scarborough
am
i
to
know
nothing
about
it
said
miss
scarborough
not
from
me
miss
scarborough
you
can
understand
that
i
can
not
tell
you
a
story
which
will
require
at
every
word
that
i
should
explain
my
thorough
disbelief
in
your
brother
i
have
been
very
angry
with
him
and
he
has
been
more
energetic
than
can
have
been
good
for
him
ah
me
you
will
have
killed
him
among
you
it
has
been
his
own
doing
you
however
had
better
go
to
him
i
must
return
to
town
this
evening
you
will
stay
for
dinner
no
i
can
not
stay
for
dinner
i
can
not
sit
down
with
mountjoy
who
has
done
nothing
in
the
least
wrong
because
i
feel
myself
to
be
altogether
opposed
to
his
interests
i
would
rather
be
out
of
the
house
so
saying
he
did
leave
the
house
and
went
back
to
london
by
train
that
afternoon
the
meeting
that
morning
which
had
been
very
stormy
can
not
be
given
word
by
word
from
the
moment
in
which
the
squire
had
declared
his
purpose
the
lawyer
had
expressed
his
disbelief
in
all
that
was
said
to
him
this
scarborough
had
at
first
taken
very
kindly
but
grey
clung
to
his
purpose
with
a
pertinacity
which
had
at
last
beaten
down
the
squire
and
had
called
for
the
interference
of
merton
how
can
i
be
quiet
the
squire
had
said
when
he
tells
me
everything
i
say
is
a
lie
it
is
a
lie
said
grey
who
had
lost
all
control
of
himself
you
should
not
say
that
grey
said
merton
he
should
spare
a
man
on
his
who
is
endeavoring
to
do
his
duty
by
his
children
said
the
man
who
thus
declared
himself
to
be
dying
i
will
go
away
said
grey
rising
he
has
forced
me
to
come
here
against
my
will
and
has
known
must
have
known
that
i
should
tell
him
what
i
thought
even
though
a
man
be
dying
a
man
can
not
accept
what
he
says
on
a
matter
of
business
such
as
this
unless
he
believe
him
i
must
tell
him
that
i
believe
him
or
that
i
do
not
i
disbelieve
the
whole
story
and
will
not
act
upon
it
as
though
i
believed
it
but
even
after
this
the
meeting
was
continued
grey
consenting
to
sit
there
and
to
hear
what
was
said
to
the
end
the
purport
of
scarborough
story
will
probably
have
been
understood
by
our
readers
it
was
scarborough
present
intention
to
make
it
understood
that
the
scheme
intended
for
the
disinheritance
of
mountjoy
had
been
false
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
and
had
been
arranged
not
for
the
injury
of
mountjoy
but
for
the
salvation
of
the
estate
from
the
hands
of
the
jews
mountjoy
would
have
lost
nothing
as
the
property
would
have
gone
entirely
to
the
jews
had
scarborough
then
died
and
mountjoy
been
taken
as
his
legitimate
heir
he
was
not
anxious
he
had
declared
to
say
anything
on
the
present
occasion
in
defence
of
his
conduct
in
that
respect
he
would
soon
be
gone
and
he
would
leave
men
to
judge
him
who
might
do
so
the
more
honestly
when
they
should
have
found
that
he
had
succeeded
in
paying
even
the
jews
in
full
the
moneys
which
they
had
actually
advanced
but
now
things
were
again
changed
and
he
was
bound
to
go
back
to
the
correct
order
of
things
no
shouted
grey
to
the
correct
order
of
things
he
went
on
mountjoy
scarborough
was
he
declared
undoubtedly
legitimate
and
then
he
made
merton
and
the
clerk
bring
forth
all
the
papers
as
though
he
had
never
brought
forth
any
papers
to
prove
the
other
statement
to
grey
and
he
did
expect
grey
to
believe
them
grey
simply
put
them
all
back
metaphorically
with
his
hand
there
had
been
two
marriages
absolutely
prepared
with
the
intent
of
enabling
him
at
some
future
time
to
upset
the
law
altogether
if
it
should
seem
good
to
him
to
do
so
and
your
wife
shouted
grey
dear
woman
she
would
have
done
anything
that
i
told
her
unless
i
had
told
her
to
do
what
was
absolutely
wrong
not
wrong
well
you
know
what
i
mean
she
was
the
purest
and
best
of
women
then
he
went
on
with
his
tale
there
had
been
two
marriages
and
he
now
brought
forth
all
the
evidence
of
the
former
marriage
it
had
taken
place
in
a
remote
town
a
village
in
the
northern
part
of
prussia
whither
she
had
been
taken
by
her
mother
to
join
him
the
two
ladies
had
both
been
since
long
dead
he
had
been
laid
up
at
the
little
prussian
town
under
the
plea
of
a
bad
leg
he
did
not
scruple
to
say
now
that
the
bad
leg
had
been
pretence
and
a
portion
of
his
scheme
the
law
he
thought
in
endeavoring
to
make
arrangements
for
his
property
the
property
which
should
have
been
his
own
had
sinned
so
greatly
as
to
drive
a
wise
man
to
much
scheming
he
had
begun
scheming
early
in
the
business
but
for
his
bad
leg
the
old
lady
would
not
have
brought
her
daughter
to
be
married
at
so
a
place
as
rummelsburg
in
pomerania
he
had
travelled
about
and
found
rummelsburg
peculiarly
fitted
for
his
enterprise
there
was
a
most
civil
old
lutheran
clergyman
there
to
whom
he
had
made
himself
peculiarly
acceptable
he
had
now
certified
copies
of
the
registry
at
rummelsburg
which
left
no
for
doubt
but
he
had
felt
that
probably
no
inquiry
would
have
been
made
about
what
had
been
done
thirty
years
ago
at
rummelsburg
had
he
himself
desired
to
be
silent
on
the
subject
there
will
be
no
difficulty
he
said
in
making
the
rummelsburg
marriage
known
to
all
the
world
i
think
there
will
very
great
difficulty
grey
had
said
not
the
least
but
when
i
had
to
be
married
in
the
light
of
day
after
mountjoy
birth
at
nice
in
italy
then
there
was
the
difficulty
it
had
to
be
done
in
the
light
of
day
and
that
little
traveller
with
his
nurse
were
with
us
nice
was
in
italy
then
and
some
contrivance
was
i
assure
you
necessary
but
it
was
done
and
i
have
always
had
with
me
the
double
sets
of
certificates
as
things
have
turned
up
i
have
had
to
keep
grey
altogether
in
the
dark
as
regards
rummelsburg
it
was
very
difficult
but
i
have
succeeded
that
grey
should
have
been
almost
driven
to
madness
by
such
an
outrage
as
this
was
a
matter
of
course
but
he
preferred
to
believe
that
rummelsburg
and
not
nice
was
the
myth
how
did
your
wife
travel
with
you
during
the
whole
of
that
year
he
had
asked
as
scarborough
no
doubt
but
we
had
been
very
little
in
society
and
the
world
at
large
seemed
willing
to
believe
almost
anything
of
me
that
was
wrong
however
there
the
rummelsburg
marriage
and
if
you
send
to
rummelsburg
you
find
that
it
all
right
a
little
white
church
up
a
corner
with
a
crooked
spire
the
old
clergyman
is
no
doubt
dead
but
i
should
imagine
that
they
would
keep
their
registers
then
he
explained
how
he
had
travelled
about
the
world
with
the
two
sets
of
certificates
and
had
made
the
second
public
when
his
object
had
been
to
convert
augustus
into
his
eldest
son
many
people
then
had
been
found
who
had
remembered
something
of
the
marriage
at
nice
and
remembered
to
have
remembered
something
at
the
time
of
having
been
in
possession
of
some
secret
as
to
the
lady
but
rummelsburg
had
been
kept
quite
in
the
dark
now
it
was
necessary
that
a
strong
light
should
be
thrown
on
the
absolute
legality
of
the
rummelsburg
marriage
he
declared
that
he
had
more
than
once
made
up
his
mind
to
destroy
those
rummelsburg
documents
but
had
always
been
deterred
by
the
reflection
that
when
they
were
once
gone
they
could
not
be
brought
back
again
i
had
always
intended
he
had
said
to
burn
the
papers
the
last
thing
before
my
death
but
as
i
learned
augustus
character
i
made
quite
certain
by
causing
them
to
be
sealed
up
in
a
parcel
addressed
to
him
so
that
if
i
had
died
by
accident
they
might
have
fallen
into
proper
hands
but
i
see
now
the
wickedness
of
my
project
and
therefore
i
give
them
over
to
mr
grey
so
saying
he
tendered
the
parcel
to
the
attorney
grey
of
course
refused
to
take
or
even
to
touch
the
rummelsburg
parcel
he
then
prepared
to
leave
the
room
declaring
it
would
be
his
duty
to
act
on
the
part
of
augustus
should
augustus
be
pleased
to
accept
his
services
but
scarborough
almost
with
tears
implored
him
to
change
his
purpose
why
should
you
set
two
brothers
by
the
ears
at
this
grey
only
shook
his
head
incredulously
and
why
ruin
the
property
without
an
object
the
property
will
come
to
ruin
not
if
you
will
take
the
matter
up
in
the
proper
spirit
but
if
you
determine
to
drive
one
brother
to
hostility
against
the
other
and
promote
unnecessary
litigation
of
course
the
lawyers
will
get
it
all
then
grey
left
the
room
boiling
with
anger
in
that
he
with
his
legal
knowledge
and
determination
to
do
right
had
been
so
utterly
thrown
aside
while
scarborough
sank
exhausted
by
the
effort
he
had
gone
through
chapter
lv
grey
remorse
grey
feeling
as
he
returned
home
was
chiefly
one
of
so
that
though
he
persisted
in
not
believing
the
story
which
had
been
told
to
him
he
did
in
truth
believe
it
he
believed
at
any
rate
in
scarborough
scarborough
had
determined
that
the
property
should
go
hither
and
thither
according
to
his
will
without
reference
to
the
established
laws
of
the
land
and
had
carried
and
would
carry
his
purpose
his
object
had
been
to
save
his
estate
from
the
hands
of
those
harpies
the
and
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
he
would
have
saved
it
he
had
in
fact
forced
the
to
lend
their
money
without
interest
and
without
security
and
then
to
consent
to
accept
their
principal
when
it
was
offered
to
them
no
one
could
say
but
that
the
deed
when
done
was
a
good
deed
but
this
man
in
doing
it
had
driven
his
coach
and
horses
through
all
the
laws
which
were
to
grey
as
holy
writ
and
in
thus
driving
his
coach
and
horses
he
had
forced
grey
to
sit
upon
the
box
and
hold
the
reins
grey
had
thought
himself
to
be
a
clever
man
at
least
a
man
but
scarborough
had
turned
him
round
his
finger
this
way
and
that
way
just
as
he
had
pleased
grey
when
in
his
rage
he
had
given
the
lie
to
scarborough
had
no
doubt
spoken
as
he
had
believed
at
that
moment
to
him
the
new
story
must
have
sounded
like
a
lie
as
he
had
been
driven
to
accept
the
veritable
lie
as
real
truth
he
had
looked
into
all
the
circumstances
of
the
marriage
at
nice
and
had
accepted
it
he
had
sent
his
partner
over
and
had
picked
up
many
incidental
confirmations
that
there
had
been
a
marriage
at
nice
between
scarborough
and
the
mother
of
augustus
was
certain
he
had
traced
back
scarborough
movements
before
the
marriage
and
could
not
learn
where
the
lady
had
joined
him
who
afterward
became
his
wife
but
it
had
become
manifest
to
him
that
she
had
travelled
with
him
bearing
his
name
but
in
vienna
barry
had
learned
that
scarborough
had
called
the
lady
by
her
maiden
name
he
might
have
learned
that
he
had
done
so
very
often
at
other
places
but
it
had
all
been
done
in
preparation
for
the
plot
in
hand
as
had
scores
of
other
little
tricks
which
have
not
cropped
up
to
the
surface
in
this
narrative
scarborough
whole
life
had
been
passed
in
arranging
tricks
for
the
defeat
of
the
law
and
it
had
been
his
great
glory
so
to
arrange
them
as
to
make
it
impossible
that
the
law
should
touch
him
mountjoy
had
declared
that
he
had
been
defrauded
the
creditors
swore
with
many
oaths
that
they
had
been
horribly
cheated
by
this
man
augustus
no
doubt
would
so
swear
very
loudly
no
man
could
swear
more
loudly
than
did
grey
as
he
left
the
squire
chamber
after
this
last
revelation
but
there
was
no
one
who
could
punish
him
the
had
no
writing
under
his
hand
had
mountjoy
been
born
without
a
it
would
have
been
very
wicked
but
the
vengeance
of
the
law
would
not
have
reached
him
if
you
deceive
your
attorney
with
false
facts
he
can
not
bring
you
before
the
magistrates
augustus
had
been
the
most
injured
of
all
but
a
son
though
he
may
bring
an
action
against
his
father
for
bigamy
can
not
summon
him
before
any
tribunal
because
he
has
married
his
mother
twice
over
these
were
scarborough
triumphs
but
they
were
very
sore
upon
grey
on
his
journey
back
to
town
as
he
turned
the
facts
over
more
coolly
in
his
mind
he
began
to
fear
that
he
saw
a
glimmer
of
the
truth
before
he
reached
london
he
almost
thought
that
mountjoy
would
be
the
heir
he
had
not
brought
a
scrap
of
paper
away
with
him
having
absolutely
refused
to
touch
the
documents
offered
to
him
he
certainly
would
not
be
employed
again
either
by
scarborough
or
on
behalf
of
his
estate
or
his
executors
he
had
threatened
that
he
would
take
up
the
cudgels
on
behalf
of
augustus
and
had
felt
at
the
moment
that
he
was
bound
to
do
so
because
as
he
had
then
thought
augustus
had
the
right
cause
but
as
that
idea
crumbled
away
from
him
augustus
and
his
affairs
became
more
and
more
distasteful
to
him
after
all
it
ought
to
be
wished
that
mountjoy
should
become
the
elder
son
even
mountjoy
the
incurable
gambler
it
was
terrible
to
grey
that
the
old
fixed
arrangement
should
be
unfixed
and
certainly
there
was
nothing
in
the
character
of
augustus
to
reconcile
him
to
such
a
change
but
he
was
a
very
unhappy
man
when
he
put
himself
into
a
cab
to
be
carried
down
to
fulham
how
much
better
would
it
have
been
for
him
had
he
taken
his
daughter
advice
and
persistently
refused
to
make
this
last
journey
to
tretton
he
would
have
to
acknowledge
to
his
daughter
that
scarborough
had
altogether
got
the
better
of
him
and
his
unhappiness
would
consist
in
the
bitterness
of
that
acknowledgment
but
when
he
reached
the
manor
house
his
daughter
met
him
with
news
of
her
own
which
for
the
moment
kept
his
news
in
abeyance
oh
papa
she
said
i
am
so
glad
you
come
he
had
sent
her
a
telegram
to
say
that
he
was
coming
just
when
i
got
your
message
i
was
frightened
out
of
my
life
who
do
you
think
was
here
with
me
how
am
i
to
think
my
dear
mr
juniper
who
on
earth
is
mr
juniper
he
asked
oh
i
remember
lover
do
you
mean
to
say
you
forgot
juniper
i
never
shall
forget
him
what
a
horrid
man
he
is
i
never
saw
juniper
in
my
life
what
did
he
want
of
you
he
says
you
have
ruined
him
utterly
he
came
here
about
two
and
found
me
at
work
in
the
garden
he
made
his
way
in
through
the
open
gate
and
would
not
be
sent
back
though
one
of
the
girls
told
him
that
there
was
nobody
at
home
he
had
seen
me
and
i
could
not
turn
him
out
of
course
what
did
he
say
to
you
was
he
impudent
he
did
not
insult
me
if
you
mean
that
but
he
was
impudent
in
not
going
away
and
i
could
not
get
rid
of
him
for
an
hour
he
says
that
you
have
doubly
ruined
him
as
how
you
would
not
let
amelia
have
the
fortune
that
you
promised
her
and
i
think
his
object
now
was
to
get
the
fortune
without
the
girl
and
he
said
also
that
he
had
lent
five
hundred
pounds
to
your
captain
scarborough
he
is
not
my
captain
scarborough
and
that
when
you
were
settling
the
captain
debts
his
was
the
only
one
you
would
not
pay
in
full
he
is
a
rogue
an
arrant
rogue
but
he
says
that
he
got
the
captain
name
to
the
five
hundred
pounds
and
he
means
to
get
it
some
of
these
days
now
that
the
captain
and
his
father
are
friends
again
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
that
he
wants
five
hundred
pounds
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
that
he
thinks
you
ought
to
let
him
have
it
he
get
it
or
the
greater
part
of
it
there
no
doubt
he
get
it
if
he
has
got
the
captain
name
if
i
remember
right
the
captain
did
sign
a
note
for
him
to
that
amount
and
he
get
the
money
if
he
has
stuck
to
it
do
you
mean
that
captain
scarborough
would
pay
all
his
debts
he
will
have
to
pay
that
one
because
it
was
not
included
in
the
schedule
what
do
you
think
has
turned
up
now
some
other
scheme
it
is
all
scheming
base
false
scheming
to
have
been
concerned
with
which
will
be
a
disgrace
to
my
name
forever
oh
papa
yes
forever
he
has
told
me
now
that
mountjoy
is
his
true
legitimate
eldest
son
he
declares
that
that
story
which
i
have
believed
for
the
last
eight
months
has
been
altogether
false
and
made
out
of
his
own
brain
to
suit
his
own
purposes
in
order
to
enable
him
to
defraud
these
he
used
a
plot
which
he
had
concocted
long
since
and
boldly
declared
augustus
to
be
his
heir
he
made
me
believe
it
and
because
i
believed
it
even
those
greedy
grasping
men
who
would
not
have
given
up
a
tithe
of
their
prey
to
save
the
whole
family
even
they
believed
it
too
now
at
the
very
point
of
death
he
comes
forward
with
perfect
coolness
and
tells
me
that
the
whole
story
was
a
plot
made
out
of
his
own
head
do
you
believe
him
now
i
became
very
wroth
and
said
that
it
was
a
lie
i
did
think
that
it
was
a
lie
i
did
flatter
myself
that
in
a
matter
concerning
my
own
business
and
in
which
i
was
bound
to
look
after
the
welfare
of
others
he
could
not
have
so
deceived
me
but
i
find
myself
as
a
child
as
a
baby
in
his
hands
then
you
do
believe
him
now
i
am
afraid
so
i
will
never
see
him
again
if
it
be
possible
for
me
to
avoid
him
he
has
treated
me
as
no
one
should
have
treated
his
enemy
let
alone
a
faithful
friend
he
must
have
scoffed
and
scorned
at
me
merely
because
i
had
faith
in
his
word
who
could
have
thought
of
a
man
laying
his
plots
so
deeply
arranging
for
twenty
years
past
the
frauds
which
he
has
now
executed
for
thirty
years
or
nearly
his
mind
has
been
busy
on
these
schemes
and
on
others
no
doubt
which
he
has
not
thought
it
necessary
to
execute
and
has
used
me
in
them
simply
as
a
machine
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
forgive
him
and
what
will
be
the
end
of
it
she
asked
who
can
say
but
this
is
clear
he
has
utterly
destroyed
my
character
as
a
lawyer
no
nothing
of
the
kind
and
it
will
be
well
if
he
have
not
done
so
as
a
man
do
you
think
that
when
people
hear
that
these
changes
have
been
made
with
my
assistance
they
will
stop
to
unravel
it
all
and
to
see
that
i
have
been
only
a
fool
and
not
a
knave
can
i
explain
under
what
stress
of
entreaty
i
went
down
there
on
this
last
occasion
papa
you
were
quite
right
to
go
he
was
your
old
friend
and
he
was
dying
even
for
this
he
was
grateful
who
will
judge
me
as
you
do
you
who
persuaded
me
that
i
should
not
have
gone
see
how
the
world
will
use
my
name
he
has
made
me
a
party
to
each
of
his
frauds
he
disinherited
mountjoy
and
he
forced
me
to
believe
the
evidence
he
brought
then
when
mountjoy
was
nobody
he
half
paid
the
creditors
by
means
of
my
assistance
they
got
all
they
were
entitled
to
get
no
till
the
law
had
decided
against
them
they
were
entitled
to
their
bonds
but
they
ruffians
though
they
are
had
advanced
so
much
hard
money
and
i
was
anxious
that
they
should
get
their
hard
money
back
again
but
unless
mountjoy
had
been
illegitimate
so
as
to
be
capable
of
inheriting
nothing
they
would
have
been
cheated
and
they
have
been
cheated
will
it
be
possible
that
i
should
make
them
or
make
others
think
that
i
have
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
and
augustus
who
will
be
what
will
he
say
against
me
in
every
turn
and
double
of
the
man
crafty
mind
i
shall
be
supposed
to
have
turned
and
doubled
with
him
i
do
not
mind
telling
the
truth
about
myself
to
you
i
should
hope
not
the
light
that
has
guided
me
through
my
professional
life
has
been
a
love
of
the
law
as
far
as
my
small
powers
have
gone
i
have
wished
to
preserve
it
intact
i
am
sure
that
the
law
and
justice
may
be
made
to
run
on
i
have
been
so
proud
of
my
country
as
to
make
that
the
rule
of
my
life
the
chance
has
brought
me
into
the
position
of
having
for
a
client
a
man
the
passion
of
whose
life
has
been
the
very
reverse
who
would
not
say
that
for
an
attorney
to
have
such
a
man
as
scarborough
of
tretton
for
his
client
was
not
a
feather
in
his
cap
but
i
have
found
him
to
be
not
only
fraudulent
but
too
clever
for
me
in
opposition
to
myself
he
has
carried
me
into
his
paths
he
has
never
induced
you
to
do
anything
that
was
wrong
conscire
sibi
that
ought
to
be
enough
for
a
simple
man
but
it
is
not
enough
for
me
it
can
not
be
enough
for
a
man
who
intends
to
act
as
an
attorney
for
others
others
must
know
it
as
well
as
i
myself
you
know
it
but
can
i
remain
an
attorney
for
you
only
there
are
some
of
whom
just
the
other
thing
is
known
but
then
they
look
for
work
of
the
other
kind
i
have
never
put
up
a
for
sharp
practice
after
this
the
sharpest
kind
of
practice
will
be
all
that
i
shall
seem
to
be
fit
for
it
is
the
money
i
can
retire
with
enough
for
your
wants
and
for
mine
if
i
could
retire
amid
the
good
words
of
men
i
should
be
happy
but
even
if
i
retire
men
will
say
that
i
have
filled
my
pockets
with
plunder
from
tretton
that
will
never
be
said
were
i
to
publish
an
account
of
the
whole
affair
which
i
am
bound
in
honor
not
to
do
explaining
it
all
from
beginning
to
end
people
would
only
say
that
i
was
endeavoring
to
lay
the
whole
weight
of
the
guilt
upon
my
confederate
who
was
dead
why
did
he
pick
me
out
for
such
usage
me
who
have
been
so
true
to
him
there
was
something
almost
weak
almost
feminine
in
the
tone
of
grey
complaints
but
to
dolly
they
were
neither
feminine
nor
weak
to
her
her
father
grief
was
true
and
but
for
herself
in
her
own
heart
there
was
some
joy
to
be
drawn
from
it
how
would
it
have
been
with
her
if
the
sharp
practice
had
been
his
and
the
success
what
would
have
been
her
state
of
mind
had
she
known
her
father
to
have
conceived
these
base
tricks
or
what
would
have
been
her
condition
had
her
father
been
of
such
a
kind
as
to
have
taught
her
that
the
doing
of
such
tricks
should
be
indifferent
to
her
to
have
been
high
above
them
all
for
him
and
for
her
was
not
that
everything
and
was
she
not
sure
that
the
truth
would
come
to
light
at
last
and
if
not
here
would
not
the
truth
come
to
light
elsewhere
where
light
would
be
of
more
avail
than
here
such
was
the
consolation
with
which
dolly
consoled
herself
on
the
next
two
days
grey
went
to
his
chambers
and
returned
without
any
new
word
as
to
scarborough
and
his
affairs
one
day
he
did
bring
back
some
tidings
as
to
juniper
juniper
has
got
into
some
row
about
a
horse
he
said
and
is
i
fear
in
prison
all
the
same
he
get
his
five
hundred
pounds
and
if
he
knew
that
fact
it
would
help
him
i
ca
tell
him
papa
i
do
know
where
he
lives
perhaps
carroll
could
do
so
i
never
speak
to
carroll
and
i
would
not
willingly
mention
juniper
name
to
my
aunt
or
to
either
of
the
girls
it
will
be
better
to
let
juniper
go
on
in
his
row
with
all
my
heart
said
grey
and
then
there
was
an
end
of
that
on
the
next
morning
the
fourth
after
his
return
from
tretton
grey
received
a
letter
from
mountjoy
scarborough
he
was
sure
he
said
that
grey
would
be
sorry
to
hear
that
his
father
had
been
very
weak
since
grey
had
gone
and
unable
even
to
see
him
mountjoy
for
more
than
two
or
three
minutes
at
a
time
he
was
afraid
that
all
would
soon
be
over
but
he
and
everybody
around
the
squire
had
been
surprised
to
find
how
cheerful
and
he
was
it
seems
wrote
mountjoy
as
though
he
had
nothing
to
regret
either
as
regards
this
world
or
the
next
he
has
no
remorse
and
certainly
no
fear
nothing
i
think
could
make
him
angry
unless
the
word
repentance
were
mentioned
to
him
to
me
and
to
his
sister
he
is
unwontedly
affectionate
but
augustus
name
has
not
crossed
his
lips
since
you
left
the
house
then
he
went
on
to
the
matter
as
to
which
his
letter
had
been
written
what
am
i
to
do
when
all
is
over
with
him
it
is
natural
that
i
should
come
to
you
for
advice
i
will
promise
nothing
about
myself
but
i
trust
that
i
may
not
return
to
the
if
i
have
this
property
to
manage
i
may
be
able
to
remain
down
here
without
going
up
to
london
but
shall
i
have
the
property
to
manage
and
what
steps
am
i
to
take
with
the
view
of
getting
it
of
course
i
shall
have
to
encounter
opposition
but
i
do
not
think
that
you
will
be
one
of
those
to
oppose
me
i
presume
that
i
shall
be
left
here
in
possession
and
that
they
say
is
nine
points
of
the
law
in
the
usual
way
i
ought
i
presume
simply
to
do
nothing
but
merely
to
take
possession
the
double
story
about
the
two
marriages
ought
to
count
for
nothing
and
i
should
be
as
though
no
such
plots
had
ever
been
hatched
but
they
have
been
hatched
and
other
people
know
of
them
the
creditors
i
presume
can
do
nothing
you
have
all
the
bonds
in
your
possession
they
may
curse
and
swear
but
will
i
imagine
have
no
power
i
doubt
whether
they
have
a
morsel
of
ground
on
which
to
raise
a
lawsuit
for
whether
i
or
augustus
be
the
eldest
son
their
claims
have
been
satisfied
in
full
but
i
presume
that
augustus
will
not
sit
quiet
what
ought
i
to
do
in
regard
to
him
as
matters
stand
at
present
he
will
not
get
a
shilling
i
fear
my
father
is
too
ill
to
make
another
will
but
at
any
rate
he
will
make
none
in
favor
of
augustus
pray
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
and
tell
me
whether
you
can
send
any
one
down
to
assist
me
when
my
father
shall
have
gone
i
will
meddle
no
farther
with
anything
in
which
the
name
of
scarborough
is
concerned
such
had
been
grey
first
assertion
when
he
received
mountjoy
letter
he
would
write
to
him
and
tell
him
that
after
what
had
passed
there
could
be
nothing
of
business
transacted
between
him
and
his
father
estate
nor
was
he
in
the
position
to
give
any
advice
on
the
subjects
mooted
he
would
wash
his
hands
of
it
altogether
but
as
he
went
home
he
thought
over
the
matter
and
told
himself
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
thus
to
repudiate
the
name
he
would
undertake
no
lawsuit
either
on
behalf
of
augustus
or
of
mountjoy
but
he
must
answer
mountjoy
letter
and
tender
him
some
advice
during
the
long
hours
of
the
subsequent
night
he
discussed
the
whole
matter
with
his
daughter
and
the
upshot
of
his
discussion
was
this
that
he
would
withdraw
his
name
from
the
business
and
leave
barry
to
manage
it
barry
might
then
act
for
either
party
as
he
pleased
chapter
lvi
scarborough
revenge
all
these
things
were
not
done
at
tretton
altogether
unknown
to
augustus
scarborough
tidings
as
to
the
will
reached
him
and
then
he
first
perceived
the
injury
he
had
done
himself
in
lending
his
assistance
to
the
payment
of
the
creditors
had
his
brother
been
utterly
bankrupt
so
that
the
jews
might
have
seized
any
money
that
might
have
come
to
him
his
father
would
have
left
no
will
in
his
favor
all
that
was
now
intelligible
to
augustus
the
idea
that
his
father
should
strip
the
house
of
every
stick
of
furniture
and
the
estate
of
every
chattel
upon
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
before
the
thing
was
done
he
had
thought
that
his
father
was
indifferent
to
all
personal
offence
and
therefore
he
had
been
offensive
he
found
out
his
mistake
and
therefore
was
angry
with
himself
but
he
still
thought
that
he
had
been
right
in
regard
to
the
creditors
had
the
creditors
been
left
in
the
possession
of
their
unpaid
bonds
they
would
have
offered
terrible
impediments
to
the
taking
possession
of
the
property
he
had
been
right
then
he
thought
the
fact
was
that
his
father
had
lived
too
long
however
the
property
would
be
left
to
him
augustus
and
he
must
make
up
his
mind
to
buy
the
other
things
from
mountjoy
he
at
any
rate
would
have
to
provide
the
funds
out
of
which
mountjoy
must
live
and
he
would
take
care
that
he
did
not
buy
the
chattels
twice
over
it
was
thus
he
consoled
himself
till
rumors
of
something
worse
reached
his
ears
how
the
rumors
reached
him
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
there
were
probably
some
among
the
servants
who
got
an
inkling
of
what
the
squire
was
doing
when
grey
again
came
down
or
miss
scarborough
had
some
confidential
friend
or
grey
clerk
may
have
been
indiscreet
the
tidings
in
some
unformed
state
did
reach
augustus
and
astounded
him
his
belief
in
his
father
story
as
to
his
brother
illegitimacy
had
been
unfixed
and
doubtful
latterly
it
had
verged
toward
more
thorough
belief
as
the
creditors
had
taken
their
money
less
than
a
third
of
what
would
have
been
theirs
had
the
power
remained
with
them
of
recovering
their
full
debt
the
creditors
had
thus
proved
their
belief
and
they
were
a
people
not
likely
to
believe
such
a
statement
without
some
foundation
but
at
any
rate
he
had
conceived
it
to
be
impossible
that
his
own
father
should
go
back
from
his
first
story
and
again
make
himself
out
to
be
doubly
a
liar
and
doubly
a
knave
but
if
it
were
so
what
should
he
do
was
it
not
the
case
that
in
such
event
he
would
be
altogether
ruined
a
penniless
adventurer
with
his
profession
absolutely
gone
from
him
what
little
money
he
had
got
together
had
been
expended
on
behalf
of
mountjoy
a
sprat
thrown
out
to
catch
a
whale
everything
according
to
the
present
tidings
had
been
left
to
mountjoy
he
had
only
half
known
his
father
who
had
turned
against
him
with
virulence
because
of
his
unkindness
who
could
have
expected
that
a
man
in
such
a
condition
should
have
lived
so
long
and
have
been
capable
of
a
will
so
powerful
he
had
not
dreamed
of
a
hatred
so
inveterate
as
his
father
for
him
he
received
news
also
from
tretton
that
his
father
was
not
now
expected
by
any
one
to
live
long
it
may
be
a
week
the
doctors
say
and
it
is
hardly
possible
that
he
should
remain
alive
for
another
month
such
was
the
news
which
reached
him
from
his
own
emissary
at
tretton
what
had
he
better
do
in
the
emergency
of
the
moment
there
was
only
one
possibly
effective
step
that
he
could
take
he
might
of
course
remain
tranquil
and
accept
what
chance
might
give
him
when
his
father
should
have
died
but
he
might
at
once
go
down
to
tretton
and
demand
an
interview
with
the
dying
man
he
did
not
think
that
his
father
even
on
his
would
refuse
to
see
him
his
pluck
was
indomitable
and
he
thought
that
he
could
depend
on
his
own
pluck
at
any
rate
he
resolved
that
he
would
immediately
go
to
tretton
and
take
his
chance
he
reached
the
house
about
the
middle
of
the
day
and
at
once
sent
his
name
up
to
his
father
miss
scarborough
was
sitting
by
her
brother
bedside
and
from
time
to
time
was
reading
to
him
a
few
words
augustus
he
said
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
left
the
room
what
does
augustus
want
with
me
the
last
time
he
saw
me
he
bade
me
die
out
of
hand
if
i
wished
to
retrieve
the
injury
i
had
done
him
do
not
think
of
that
now
john
his
sister
said
as
god
is
my
judge
i
will
think
of
it
to
the
last
moment
words
such
as
those
spoken
by
a
son
to
his
father
demand
a
little
thought
were
i
to
tell
you
that
i
did
not
think
of
them
would
you
not
know
that
i
was
a
hypocrite
you
need
not
speak
of
them
john
not
unless
he
came
here
to
harass
my
last
moments
i
strove
to
do
very
much
for
him
you
know
with
what
return
mountjoy
has
been
at
any
rate
honest
and
straightforward
and
considering
all
things
not
lacking
in
respect
i
shall
at
any
rate
have
some
pleasure
in
letting
augustus
know
the
state
of
my
mind
what
shall
i
say
to
him
his
sister
asked
tell
him
that
he
had
better
go
back
to
london
i
have
tried
them
both
as
few
sons
can
be
tried
by
their
father
and
i
know
them
now
tell
him
with
my
compliments
that
it
will
be
better
for
him
not
to
see
me
there
can
be
nothing
pleasant
said
between
us
i
have
no
communication
to
make
to
him
which
could
in
the
least
interest
him
but
before
night
came
the
squire
had
been
talked
over
and
had
agreed
to
see
his
son
the
interview
will
be
easy
enough
for
me
he
had
said
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
he
will
get
from
me
but
let
him
come
as
he
will
augustus
spent
much
of
the
intervening
time
in
discussing
the
matter
with
his
aunt
but
not
a
word
on
the
subject
was
spoken
by
him
to
mountjoy
whom
he
met
at
dinner
and
with
whom
he
spent
the
evening
in
company
with
merton
the
two
hours
after
dinner
were
melancholy
enough
the
three
adjourned
to
the
and
sat
there
almost
without
conversation
a
few
words
were
said
about
the
hunting
but
mountjoy
had
not
hunted
this
winter
there
were
a
few
also
of
greater
interest
about
the
shooting
the
shooting
was
of
course
still
the
property
of
the
old
man
and
in
the
early
months
had
without
many
words
spoken
become
as
it
were
an
appanage
of
the
condition
of
life
to
which
augustus
aspired
but
of
late
mountjoy
had
assumed
the
command
you
found
plenty
of
pheasants
here
i
suppose
augustus
remarked
well
yes
not
too
many
i
did
trouble
myself
much
about
it
when
i
saw
a
pheasant
i
shot
it
i
been
a
little
troubled
in
spirit
you
know
gambling
again
i
heard
that
did
trouble
me
much
merton
can
tell
you
that
we
had
a
yes
indeed
said
merton
it
has
seemed
to
be
a
time
in
which
a
man
would
think
very
much
of
his
pheasants
i
do
know
why
said
augustus
who
was
determined
not
to
put
up
with
the
rebuke
implied
in
the
doctor
words
after
that
there
was
nothing
more
said
between
them
till
they
all
went
to
their
separate
apartments
do
contradict
him
his
aunt
said
to
him
the
next
morning
and
if
he
reprimands
you
acknowledge
that
you
have
been
wrong
that
hard
when
i
have
been
wrong
but
so
much
depends
upon
it
and
he
is
so
stern
of
course
i
wish
well
for
both
of
you
there
is
plenty
enough
plenty
if
only
you
could
agree
together
but
the
injustice
of
his
treatment
is
it
true
that
he
now
declares
mountjoy
to
be
the
eldest
son
i
believe
so
i
do
not
know
but
i
believe
it
think
of
what
his
conduct
has
been
to
me
and
then
you
tell
me
that
i
am
to
own
that
i
have
been
wrong
in
what
have
i
been
wrong
he
is
your
father
and
i
suppose
you
have
said
hard
words
to
him
did
i
rebuke
him
because
he
had
fraudulently
kept
me
for
so
many
years
in
the
position
of
a
younger
son
did
i
not
forgive
him
that
iniquity
but
he
says
you
are
a
younger
son
this
last
move
he
said
with
great
passion
has
only
been
made
in
an
attempt
to
punish
me
because
i
would
not
tell
him
that
i
was
under
a
world
of
obligations
to
him
for
simply
declaring
the
truth
as
to
my
birth
we
can
not
both
be
his
eldest
son
no
certainly
not
both
at
last
he
declared
that
i
was
his
heir
if
i
did
say
hard
words
to
him
were
they
not
justified
not
to
your
father
said
miss
scarborough
shaking
her
head
that
is
your
idea
how
was
i
to
abstain
think
what
had
been
done
to
me
through
my
whole
life
he
had
deceived
me
and
had
attempted
to
rob
me
but
he
says
that
he
had
intended
to
get
the
property
for
you
to
get
it
it
was
mine
according
to
what
he
said
it
was
my
own
he
had
robbed
me
to
give
it
to
mountjoy
now
he
intends
to
rob
me
again
in
order
that
mountjoy
may
have
it
he
will
leave
such
a
kettle
of
fish
behind
him
with
all
his
manoeuvring
that
neither
of
us
will
be
the
better
of
tretton
then
he
went
to
the
squire
in
spite
of
what
had
passed
between
him
and
his
aunt
he
had
thought
deeply
of
his
conduct
to
his
father
in
the
past
and
of
the
manner
in
which
he
would
now
carry
himself
he
was
aware
that
he
had
behaved
not
badly
for
that
he
esteemed
nothing
but
most
unwisely
when
he
had
found
himself
to
be
the
heir
to
tretton
he
had
fancied
himself
to
be
almost
the
possessor
and
had
acted
on
the
instincts
which
on
such
a
case
would
have
been
natural
to
him
to
have
pardoned
the
man
because
he
was
his
father
and
then
to
have
treated
him
with
insolent
disdain
as
some
dying
old
man
almost
entirely
beneath
his
notice
was
what
he
felt
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
demanded
and
whether
the
story
was
true
or
false
it
would
have
been
the
same
he
had
come
at
last
to
believe
it
to
be
true
and
had
therefore
been
the
more
resolute
but
whether
it
were
true
or
false
the
old
man
had
struck
his
blow
and
he
must
abide
by
it
till
the
moment
came
in
which
he
had
received
that
communication
from
tretton
the
idea
had
never
occurred
to
him
that
another
disposition
of
the
property
might
still
be
within
his
father
power
but
he
had
little
known
the
old
man
power
or
the
fertility
of
his
resources
or
the
extent
of
his
malice
after
what
you
have
done
you
should
cease
to
stay
and
disturb
us
he
had
once
said
when
his
father
had
jokingly
alluded
to
his
own
death
he
had
at
once
repented
and
had
felt
that
such
a
speech
had
been
iniquitous
as
coming
from
a
son
but
his
father
had
at
the
moment
expressed
no
deep
animosity
some
sarcastic
words
had
fallen
from
him
of
which
augustus
had
not
understood
the
bitterness
but
he
had
remembered
it
since
and
was
now
not
so
much
surprised
at
his
father
wish
to
injure
him
as
at
his
power
but
could
he
have
any
such
power
grey
he
knew
was
on
his
side
and
grey
was
a
thorough
lawyer
all
the
world
was
on
his
side
all
the
world
having
been
instructed
to
think
and
to
believe
that
scarborough
had
not
been
married
till
after
mountjoy
was
born
all
the
world
had
been
much
surprised
and
would
be
unwilling
to
encounter
another
blow
should
he
go
into
his
father
room
altogether
penitent
or
should
he
hold
up
his
head
and
justify
himself
one
thing
was
brought
home
to
him
by
thinking
as
a
matter
of
which
he
might
be
convinced
no
penitence
could
now
avail
him
anything
he
had
at
any
rate
by
this
time
looked
sufficiently
into
his
father
character
to
be
sure
that
he
would
not
forgive
such
an
offence
as
had
been
his
any
vice
any
extravagance
almost
any
personal
neglect
would
have
been
pardoned
i
have
so
brought
him
up
the
father
would
have
said
and
the
fault
must
be
counted
as
my
own
but
his
son
had
deliberately
expressed
a
wish
for
his
father
death
and
had
expressed
it
in
his
father
presence
he
had
shown
not
only
neglect
which
may
arise
at
a
distance
and
may
not
be
absolutely
intentional
but
these
words
had
been
said
with
the
purpose
of
wounding
and
were
and
would
be
unpardonable
augustus
as
he
went
along
the
corridor
to
his
room
determined
that
he
would
at
any
rate
not
be
penitent
well
sir
how
do
you
find
yourself
he
said
walking
in
briskly
and
putting
out
his
hand
to
his
father
the
old
man
languidly
gave
his
hand
but
only
smiled
i
hear
of
you
though
not
from
you
and
they
tell
me
that
you
have
not
been
quite
so
strong
of
late
i
shall
soon
cease
to
stay
and
trouble
you
said
the
squire
with
affected
weakness
in
a
voice
hardly
above
a
whisper
using
the
very
words
which
augustus
had
spoken
there
have
been
some
moments
between
us
sir
which
have
been
unfortunately
unpleasant
and
yet
i
have
done
so
much
to
make
them
pleasant
to
you
i
should
have
thought
that
the
offer
of
all
tretton
would
have
gone
for
much
with
you
augustus
was
again
taken
in
there
was
a
piteous
whine
about
his
father
voice
which
once
more
deceived
him
he
did
not
dream
of
the
depth
of
the
old
man
anger
he
did
not
imagine
that
at
such
a
moment
it
could
boil
over
with
such
ferocity
nor
was
he
altogether
aware
of
the
quietude
with
which
he
could
pave
the
way
for
his
last
spring
mountjoy
by
far
the
least
gifted
of
the
two
had
gained
the
truer
insight
to
his
father
character
you
had
done
much
or
rather
as
i
supposed
circumstances
had
done
much
circumstances
the
facts
i
mean
as
to
mountjoy
birth
and
my
own
i
have
not
always
left
myself
to
be
governed
by
actual
circumstances
if
there
was
any
omission
on
my
part
of
an
expression
of
proper
feeling
i
regret
it
i
do
know
that
there
was
what
is
proper
feeling
there
was
no
hypocrisy
at
any
rate
you
sometimes
are
a
little
bitter
sir
i
hope
you
wo
find
it
so
when
i
am
gone
i
do
know
what
i
said
that
has
angered
you
but
i
may
have
been
driven
to
say
what
i
did
not
feel
certainly
not
to
me
i
not
here
to
beg
pardon
for
any
special
fault
as
i
do
not
quite
know
of
what
i
am
accused
of
nothing
there
is
no
accusation
at
all
nor
what
the
punishment
is
to
be
i
have
learned
that
you
have
left
to
mountjoy
all
the
furniture
in
the
house
yes
poor
boy
when
i
found
that
you
had
turned
him
out
i
never
turned
him
out
not
till
your
house
was
open
to
receive
him
you
would
not
have
wished
him
to
go
into
the
i
did
the
very
best
for
him
i
kept
him
going
when
there
was
no
one
else
to
give
him
a
shilling
he
must
have
had
a
bitter
time
said
the
father
i
hope
it
may
have
done
him
good
i
think
i
behaved
to
him
just
as
an
elder
brother
should
have
done
he
was
not
particularly
grateful
but
that
was
not
my
fault
still
i
thought
it
best
to
leave
him
the
old
sticks
about
the
place
as
he
was
to
have
the
property
it
was
better
that
he
should
have
the
sticks
as
he
said
this
he
managed
to
turn
himself
round
and
look
his
son
full
in
the
face
such
a
look
as
it
was
there
was
the
gleam
of
victory
and
the
glory
of
triumph
and
the
venom
of
malice
you
would
have
them
separated
would
you
i
have
heard
of
some
farther
trick
of
this
kind
just
the
ordinary
way
in
which
things
ought
to
be
allowed
to
run
grey
who
is
a
very
good
man
persuaded
me
no
man
ought
to
interfere
with
the
law
an
attempt
in
that
direction
led
to
evil
mountjoy
is
the
eldest
son
you
know
i
know
nothing
of
the
kind
oh
dear
no
there
is
no
question
at
all
as
to
the
date
of
my
marriage
with
your
mother
we
were
married
in
quite
a
straightforward
way
at
rummelsburg
when
i
wanted
to
save
the
property
from
those
harpies
i
was
surprised
to
find
how
easily
i
managed
it
grey
was
a
little
soft
there
an
excellent
man
but
too
credulous
for
a
lawyer
i
do
not
believe
a
word
of
it
you
find
it
all
go
as
naturally
as
possible
when
i
have
ceased
to
stay
and
be
troublesome
but
one
thing
i
must
say
in
your
favor
what
do
you
mean
i
never
could
have
managed
it
all
unless
you
had
consented
to
that
payment
of
the
creditors
indeed
i
must
say
that
was
chiefly
your
own
doing
when
you
first
suggested
it
i
saw
what
a
fine
thing
you
were
contriving
for
your
brother
i
should
think
after
that
of
leaving
it
all
so
that
you
need
not
find
out
the
truth
when
i
am
dead
i
do
think
i
had
so
managed
it
that
you
would
have
had
the
property
mountjoy
who
has
some
foolish
feeling
about
his
mother
and
who
is
obstinate
as
a
pig
would
have
fought
it
out
but
i
had
so
contrived
that
you
would
have
had
it
i
had
sealed
up
every
document
referring
to
the
rummelsburg
marriage
and
had
addressed
them
all
to
you
i
could
have
made
it
safer
could
i
i
do
know
what
you
mean
you
would
have
been
enabled
to
destroy
every
scrap
of
the
evidence
which
will
be
wanted
to
prove
your
brother
legitimacy
had
i
burned
the
papers
i
could
not
have
put
them
more
beyond
poor
mountjoy
reach
now
they
are
quite
safe
in
grey
office
his
clerk
took
them
away
with
him
i
would
not
leave
them
here
with
mountjoy
because
well
you
might
come
and
he
might
be
murdered
now
scarborough
had
had
his
revenge
you
think
you
have
done
your
duty
said
augustus
i
do
not
care
two
straws
about
doing
my
duty
young
man
here
scarborough
raised
himself
in
part
and
spoke
in
that
strong
voice
which
was
supposed
to
be
so
deleterious
to
him
or
rather
in
seeking
my
duty
i
look
beyond
the
conventionalities
of
the
world
i
think
that
you
have
behaved
damnably
and
that
i
have
punished
you
because
of
mountjoy
weakness
because
he
had
been
knocked
off
his
legs
i
endeavored
to
put
you
upon
yours
you
at
once
turned
upon
me
when
you
thought
the
deed
was
done
and
bade
me
go
and
bury
myself
you
were
a
little
too
quick
in
your
desire
to
become
the
owner
of
tretton
park
at
once
i
have
stayed
long
enough
to
give
some
farther
trouble
you
will
not
say
after
this
that
i
am
and
unable
to
make
a
will
you
will
find
that
under
mine
not
one
not
one
scrap
of
property
will
become
yours
mountjoy
will
take
care
of
you
i
do
not
doubt
he
must
hate
you
but
will
recognize
you
as
his
brother
i
am
not
so
and
will
not
recognize
you
as
my
son
now
you
may
go
away
so
saying
he
turned
himself
round
to
the
wall
and
refused
to
be
induced
to
utter
another
word
augustus
began
to
speak
but
when
he
had
commenced
his
second
sentence
the
old
man
rung
his
bell
mary
said
he
to
his
sister
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
get
augustus
to
go
away
i
am
very
weak
and
if
he
remains
he
will
be
the
death
of
me
he
ca
get
anything
by
killing
me
at
once
it
is
too
late
for
that
then
augustus
did
leave
the
room
and
before
the
night
came
had
left
tretton
also
he
presumed
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
there
one
word
he
did
say
to
mountjoy
you
will
understand
mountjoy
that
when
our
father
is
dead
tretton
will
not
become
your
property
i
shall
understand
nothing
of
the
kind
said
mountjoy
but
i
suppose
grey
will
tell
me
what
i
am
to
do
chapter
lvii
prosper
shows
his
while
these
things
were
going
on
at
tretton
and
while
scarborough
was
making
all
arrangements
for
the
adequate
disposition
of
his
property
in
doing
which
he
had
happily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
necessity
for
interfering
with
what
the
law
had
settled
prosper
was
lying
very
ill
at
buston
and
was
endeavoring
on
his
to
reconcile
himself
to
what
the
entail
had
done
for
him
there
could
be
no
other
heir
to
him
but
harry
annesley
as
he
thought
of
the
unmarried
ladies
of
his
acquaintance
he
found
that
there
was
no
one
who
would
have
done
for
him
but
miss
puffle
and
matilda
thoroughbung
all
others
were
too
young
or
too
old
or
chiefly
penniless
miss
puffle
would
have
been
the
exact
thing
only
for
that
intruding
farmer
son
as
he
lay
there
alone
in
his
bedroom
his
mind
used
to
wander
a
little
and
he
would
send
for
matthew
his
butler
and
hold
confidential
discussions
with
him
i
never
did
think
sir
that
miss
thoroughbung
was
exactly
the
lady
said
matthew
why
not
well
sir
there
is
a
saying
but
you
excuse
me
go
on
matthew
there
is
a
saying
as
how
ca
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
ear
i
heard
that
just
so
sir
now
miss
thoroughbung
is
a
very
nice
lady
i
do
think
she
a
nice
lady
at
all
but
of
course
it
not
becoming
in
me
to
speak
against
my
betters
and
as
a
menial
servant
i
never
would
go
on
matthew
miss
thoroughbung
is
go
on
matthew
well
she
is
a
sow
ear
ai
she
now
the
servants
here
never
would
have
looked
upon
her
as
a
silk
purse
would
they
never
she
has
a
way
with
her
just
as
though
she
did
care
for
silk
purses
and
it
my
mind
sir
that
she
do
she
wishes
however
to
be
uppermost
and
if
she
had
come
here
she
have
said
so
that
can
never
be
thank
god
that
can
never
be
oh
no
brewers
is
brewers
and
must
be
there
joe
he
very
well
no
doubt
i
have
the
pleasure
of
his
acquaintance
him
as
is
to
marry
miss
molly
but
miss
molly
ai
the
head
of
the
family
is
she
sir
here
the
squire
shook
his
head
you
the
head
of
the
family
sir
i
suppose
so
and
is
i
might
make
so
bold
as
to
speak
go
on
matthew
miss
thoroughbung
would
be
a
little
out
of
place
at
buston
hall
now
as
to
miss
puffle
miss
puffle
is
a
lady
or
was
no
doubt
sir
the
puffles
is
not
quite
equal
to
the
prospers
as
i
can
hear
but
the
puffles
is
ladies
and
gentlemen
the
servants
below
all
give
it
up
to
them
that
they
real
gentlefolk
but
well
she
demeaned
herself
terribly
with
young
tazlehurst
they
all
said
as
there
were
more
where
that
came
from
what
should
they
mean
by
that
she
indulge
in
low
such
as
never
would
have
been
put
up
with
at
buston
hall
and
miss
puffle
not
herself
i
do
say
that
but
it
like
enough
if
you
heard
all
but
them
as
lets
others
do
it
almost
does
it
themselves
and
them
as
lets
others
drink
sperrrits
o
mornings
come
nigh
to
having
a
dram
down
their
own
throats
oh
laws
exclaimed
prosper
thinking
of
the
escape
he
had
had
you
would
have
liked
it
sir
if
there
had
been
a
bottle
of
gin
in
the
bedroom
here
prosper
hid
his
face
among
the
bedclothes
it
ai
all
that
comes
silk
out
of
the
skein
that
does
to
make
a
purse
of
there
were
difficulties
in
the
pursuit
of
matrimony
of
which
prosper
had
not
thought
his
imagination
at
once
pictured
to
himself
a
bride
with
a
bottle
of
gin
under
her
pillow
and
he
went
on
shivering
till
matthew
almost
thought
that
he
had
been
attacked
by
an
i
shall
give
it
up
at
any
rate
he
said
after
a
pause
of
course
you
a
young
man
sir
no
i
not
that
is
not
exactly
young
you
an
old
fool
to
tell
such
lies
of
course
i
an
old
fool
but
i
endeavor
to
be
veracious
i
never
did
take
a
shilling
as
were
yours
nor
a
shilling
worth
all
the
years
i
have
known
you
mr
prosper
what
has
that
to
do
with
it
i
not
a
young
man
what
am
i
to
say
sir
shall
i
say
as
you
are
the
truth
is
matthew
i
worn
out
then
i
would
think
of
taking
a
wife
troubles
have
been
too
heavy
for
me
to
bear
i
do
think
i
was
intended
to
bear
trouble
is
born
to
trouble
as
the
sparks
fly
upward
said
matthew
i
suppose
so
but
one
man
luck
is
harder
than
another
they
been
too
many
for
me
and
i
feel
that
i
sinking
under
them
it
no
good
my
thinking
of
marrying
now
that
what
i
was
coming
to
when
you
said
i
was
an
old
fool
of
course
i
am
an
old
fool
do
have
done
with
it
harry
has
been
exactly
what
he
ought
to
have
been
to
me
he
a
very
comely
young
gentleman
what
has
comely
to
do
with
it
them
as
is
is
more
likely
to
stay
at
home
and
be
quiet
you
could
expect
one
as
is
so
handsome
to
stay
at
buston
and
hear
sermons
i
do
expect
him
to
be
knocking
men
about
in
the
streets
at
midnight
it
ai
that
sir
i
say
it
is
that
very
well
sir
only
we
all
heard
as
harry
him
as
struck
the
first
blow
it
was
all
about
a
young
lady
i
know
what
it
was
about
a
young
lady
as
is
a
young
lady
this
was
felt
to
the
quick
by
prosper
in
regard
to
the
miss
puffle
and
the
miss
thoroughbung
but
as
he
was
beginning
to
think
that
the
continuation
of
the
family
of
the
prospers
must
depend
on
the
marriage
which
harry
might
make
he
passed
over
the
slur
upon
himself
for
the
sake
of
the
praise
given
to
the
future
mother
of
the
and
when
a
young
gentleman
has
set
his
heart
on
a
young
lady
he
not
going
to
be
braggydoshoed
out
of
it
captain
scarborough
knew
her
first
first
come
first
served
is
always
the
way
with
lovers
harry
was
the
conquering
hero
widi
wici
halloo
matthew
them
the
words
as
they
say
a
young
gentleman
ought
to
use
when
got
the
better
of
a
young
lady
affections
and
i
dare
say
they
the
very
words
as
put
the
captain
into
such
a
towering
passion
i
can
understand
how
it
happened
just
as
if
i
saw
it
but
he
went
away
and
left
him
bleeding
and
speechless
he
knocked
his
widi
out
of
him
i
guess
i
think
prosper
you
should
forgive
him
prosper
had
thought
so
too
but
had
hardly
known
how
to
express
himself
after
his
second
burst
of
anger
but
he
was
at
the
present
ill
and
weak
and
was
anxious
to
have
some
one
near
to
him
who
should
be
more
like
a
silk
purse
than
his
butler
matthew
suppose
you
was
to
send
for
him
sir
he
would
come
let
him
alone
for
coming
they
tell
me
sir
who
tells
you
why
sir
the
servants
now
at
the
rectory
of
course
sir
where
two
families
is
so
near
connected
the
servants
are
just
as
near
it
no
more
than
natural
they
tell
me
now
that
since
you
were
so
kind
about
the
allowance
their
talk
of
you
is
all
changed
then
the
anger
was
heated
hot
again
their
talk
had
all
been
against
him
till
he
had
opened
his
hand
in
regard
to
the
allowance
and
now
when
there
was
something
again
to
be
got
they
could
be
civil
there
was
none
of
that
love
of
him
for
himself
for
which
an
old
man
is
always
hankering
for
which
the
sick
man
breaks
his
heart
but
which
the
old
and
sick
find
it
so
difficult
to
get
from
the
young
and
healthy
it
is
in
nature
that
the
old
man
should
keep
the
purse
in
his
own
pocket
or
otherwise
he
will
have
so
little
to
attract
he
is
weak
querulous
ugly
to
look
at
apt
to
be
greedy
cross
and
untidy
though
he
himself
can
love
what
is
his
love
to
any
one
duty
demands
that
one
shall
smooth
his
pillow
and
some
one
does
smooth
it
as
a
duty
but
the
old
man
feels
the
difference
and
remembers
the
time
when
there
was
one
who
was
anxious
to
share
it
prosper
was
not
in
years
an
old
man
and
had
not
as
yet
passed
that
time
of
life
at
which
many
a
man
is
regarded
by
his
children
as
the
best
of
their
playfellows
but
he
was
weak
in
body
and
jealous
in
spirit
he
had
the
heart
to
lay
out
for
himself
a
generous
line
of
conduct
but
not
the
purpose
to
stick
to
it
steadily
his
nephew
had
ever
been
a
trouble
to
him
because
he
had
expected
from
his
nephew
a
kind
of
worship
to
which
he
had
felt
that
he
was
entitled
as
the
head
of
the
family
all
good
things
were
to
come
from
him
and
therefore
good
things
should
be
given
to
him
harry
had
told
himself
that
his
uncle
was
not
his
father
and
that
it
had
not
been
his
fault
that
he
was
his
uncle
heir
he
had
not
asked
his
uncle
for
an
allowance
he
had
grown
up
with
the
feeling
that
buston
hall
was
to
be
his
own
and
had
not
regarded
his
uncle
as
the
donor
his
father
with
his
large
family
had
never
exacted
much
had
wanted
no
special
attention
from
him
and
if
not
his
father
then
why
his
uncle
but
his
inattention
his
absence
of
gratitude
for
peculiar
gifts
had
sunk
deep
into
prosper
bosom
hence
had
come
miss
thoroughbung
as
his
last
resource
and
miss
thoroughbung
had
called
him
peter
hence
his
mind
had
wandered
to
miss
puffle
and
miss
puffle
had
gone
off
with
the
farmer
son
and
as
he
was
now
informed
had
taken
to
drinking
gin
therefore
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
prepared
himself
to
die
on
the
next
day
he
sent
for
matthew
again
matthew
first
came
to
him
always
in
the
morning
but
on
that
occasion
very
little
conversation
ever
took
place
in
the
middle
of
the
day
he
had
a
bowl
of
soup
brought
to
him
and
by
that
time
had
managed
to
drag
himself
out
of
bed
and
to
clothe
himself
in
his
and
to
seat
himself
in
his
then
when
the
soup
had
been
slowly
eaten
he
would
ring
his
bell
and
the
conversation
would
begin
i
have
been
thinking
over
what
i
was
saying
yesterday
matthew
matthew
simply
assented
but
he
knew
in
his
heart
that
his
master
had
been
thinking
over
what
he
himself
had
said
is
harry
at
the
rectory
oh
yes
he
there
now
he
would
stir
from
the
rectory
till
he
hears
that
you
are
better
why
should
he
stir
does
he
mean
to
say
that
i
going
to
die
perhaps
i
am
i
very
weak
but
he
does
know
it
matthew
felt
that
he
had
made
a
blunder
and
that
he
must
get
out
of
it
as
well
as
he
could
it
is
that
he
is
thinking
anything
of
that
but
you
are
confined
to
your
room
sir
of
course
he
knows
that
i
never
told
him
he
most
particular
in
his
inquiries
from
day
to
day
does
he
come
here
he
do
venture
on
that
because
he
knows
as
how
you
would
wish
it
why
should
i
wish
it
it
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
there
has
been
a
little
i
quite
sure
harry
do
wish
to
intrude
if
you
let
me
give
it
to
be
understood
that
you
like
him
to
call
he
be
over
here
in
a
jiffy
then
very
slowly
prosper
did
give
it
to
be
understood
that
he
would
take
it
as
a
compliment
if
his
nephew
would
walk
across
the
park
and
ask
after
him
he
was
most
particular
as
to
the
mode
in
which
this
embassy
should
be
conducted
harry
was
not
to
be
made
to
think
that
he
was
to
come
rushing
into
the
house
after
his
old
fashion
halloo
uncle
are
you
well
hope
you
be
better
when
i
come
back
have
got
to
be
off
by
the
next
train
then
he
used
to
fly
away
and
not
be
heard
of
again
for
a
week
and
yet
the
message
was
to
be
conveyed
with
an
alluring
courtesy
that
might
be
attractive
and
might
indicate
that
no
hostility
was
intended
but
it
was
not
to
be
a
positive
message
but
one
which
would
signify
what
might
possibly
take
place
if
it
should
happen
that
harry
was
walking
in
this
direction
it
might
also
happen
that
his
uncle
would
be
pleased
to
see
him
there
was
no
better
ambassador
at
hand
than
matthew
and
therefore
matthew
was
commissioned
to
arrange
matters
if
you
can
get
at
mrs
weeks
and
do
it
through
his
mother
suggested
prosper
then
matthew
winked
and
departed
on
his
errand
in
about
two
hours
there
was
a
ring
at
the
of
which
prosper
knew
well
the
sound
miss
thoroughbung
had
not
been
there
very
often
but
he
had
learned
to
distinguish
her
ring
or
her
servant
in
old
days
not
so
very
far
removed
harry
had
never
been
accustomed
to
ring
at
all
but
yet
his
uncle
knew
that
it
was
he
and
not
the
doctor
who
might
probably
come
or
soames
of
whose
coming
he
lived
in
hourly
dread
you
can
show
him
up
he
said
to
matthew
opening
the
door
with
great
exertion
and
attempting
to
speak
to
the
servant
down
the
stairs
harry
at
any
rate
was
shown
up
and
in
two
minutes
time
was
standing
over
his
uncle
i
have
not
been
quite
well
just
lately
he
said
in
answer
to
the
inquiries
made
we
are
very
sorry
to
hear
that
sir
i
suppose
you
heard
it
before
we
did
hear
that
you
were
a
little
out
of
sorts
out
of
sorts
i
do
know
what
you
call
out
of
sorts
i
have
not
been
out
of
this
room
for
a
month
my
sister
came
to
see
me
one
day
and
that
the
last
christian
i
seen
my
mother
would
be
over
daily
if
she
fancied
you
like
it
she
has
her
own
duties
and
i
do
want
to
be
troublesome
the
truth
is
uncle
prosper
that
we
have
all
felt
that
we
have
been
in
your
black
books
and
as
we
have
not
thought
that
we
deserved
it
there
has
been
a
little
coolness
i
told
your
mother
that
i
was
willing
to
forgive
you
forgive
me
what
a
fellow
does
not
care
to
be
forgiven
when
he
has
done
nothing
but
if
you
only
say
that
shall
be
quite
past
i
take
it
so
he
could
not
give
up
his
position
as
head
of
the
family
so
easily
an
injured
head
of
the
family
and
yet
he
was
anxious
that
should
be
if
only
the
young
man
would
not
be
so
jaunty
as
he
stood
there
by
his
just
say
the
word
and
the
girls
shall
come
up
and
see
you
as
they
used
to
do
prosper
thought
at
the
moment
that
one
of
the
girls
was
going
to
marry
joe
thoroughbung
and
that
he
would
not
wish
to
see
her
as
for
myself
if
i
been
in
any
way
negligent
i
can
only
say
that
i
did
not
intend
it
i
do
not
like
to
say
more
because
it
would
seem
as
though
i
were
asking
you
for
money
i
do
know
why
you
should
ask
me
a
man
does
like
to
do
that
but
i
tell
you
of
everything
if
only
let
me
what
is
there
to
tell
said
uncle
prosper
knowing
well
that
the
would
be
communicated
to
him
i
got
myself
engaged
to
marry
a
young
woman
a
young
woman
yes
she
a
young
woman
of
course
but
she
a
young
lady
as
well
you
know
her
name
it
is
florence
mountjoy
that
is
the
young
lady
that
i
heard
of
was
there
not
some
other
gentleman
attached
to
her
there
was
her
cousin
mountjoy
scarborough
his
father
wrote
to
me
his
father
is
the
meanest
fellow
i
ever
met
and
he
himself
came
to
me
down
here
they
were
fighting
your
battle
for
you
i
much
obliged
to
them
for
even
i
have
interfered
with
him
about
the
lady
then
harry
had
to
repeat
his
vidi
after
his
own
fashion
of
course
i
interfered
with
him
how
is
a
fellow
to
help
himself
we
both
of
us
were
spooning
on
the
same
girl
and
of
course
she
had
to
decide
it
and
she
decided
for
you
i
fancy
she
did
at
any
rate
i
decided
for
her
and
i
mean
to
have
her
then
prosper
was
for
him
very
gracious
in
his
congratulations
saying
all
manner
of
good
things
of
miss
mountjoy
i
think
you
like
her
uncle
prosper
prosper
did
not
doubt
but
that
he
would
appease
the
solicitor
he
also
had
heard
of
miss
mountjoy
and
what
he
had
heard
had
been
much
to
the
young
lady
credit
then
he
asked
a
few
questions
as
to
the
time
fixed
for
the
marriage
here
harry
was
obliged
to
own
that
there
were
difficulties
miss
mountjoy
had
promised
not
to
marry
for
three
years
without
her
mother
consent
three
years
said
prosper
then
i
shall
be
dead
and
buried
harry
did
not
tell
his
uncle
that
in
that
case
the
difficulty
might
probably
vanish
as
the
same
degree
of
fate
which
had
robbed
him
of
his
poor
uncle
would
have
made
him
owner
of
buston
in
such
a
case
as
that
mountjoy
might
probably
give
way
but
why
is
the
young
lady
to
be
kept
from
marriage
for
three
years
does
she
wish
it
harry
said
that
he
did
not
exactly
think
that
miss
mountjoy
on
her
own
behalf
did
wish
for
so
prolonged
a
separation
the
fact
is
sir
that
mountjoy
is
not
my
best
friend
this
nephew
of
hers
mountjoy
scarborough
has
always
been
her
favorite
but
he
a
man
that
always
loses
his
money
at
cards
he
to
have
all
tretton
now
it
seems
and
what
does
the
young
lady
say
all
tretton
wo
move
her
i
not
a
bit
afraid
i
got
her
word
and
that
enough
for
me
how
it
is
that
her
mother
should
think
it
possible
that
what
i
do
not
know
the
three
years
are
quite
fixed
i
do
quite
say
that
altogether
but
a
young
lady
who
will
be
true
to
you
will
be
true
to
her
mother
also
harry
shook
his
head
he
was
quite
willing
to
guarantee
florence
truth
as
to
her
promise
to
him
but
he
did
not
think
that
her
promise
to
her
mother
need
be
put
on
the
same
footing
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
you
can
arrange
it
any
other
way
three
years
is
a
long
time
quite
absurd
you
know
said
harry
with
energy
what
made
her
fix
on
three
years
i
do
know
how
they
did
it
between
them
mountjoy
perhaps
thought
that
it
might
give
time
to
her
nephew
ten
years
would
be
the
same
as
far
as
he
is
concerned
florence
is
a
girl
who
when
she
says
that
she
loves
a
man
means
it
for
you
do
suppose
i
intend
to
remain
three
years
what
do
you
intend
to
do
one
has
to
wait
a
little
and
see
then
there
was
a
long
pause
during
which
harry
stood
twiddling
his
fingers
he
had
nothing
farther
to
suggest
but
he
thought
that
his
uncle
might
say
something
shall
i
come
again
uncle
prosper
he
said
i
have
got
a
plan
said
uncle
prosper
what
is
it
uncle
i
do
know
that
it
can
lead
to
anything
it
of
no
use
of
course
if
the
young
lady
will
wait
the
three
years
i
do
think
she
at
all
anxious
said
harry
you
might
marry
almost
at
once
that
what
i
should
like
and
come
and
live
here
in
this
house
why
not
i
nobody
you
soon
find
that
i
nobody
that
nonsense
uncle
prosper
of
course
you
everybody
in
your
own
house
you
might
endure
it
for
six
months
in
the
year
harry
thought
of
the
sermons
but
resolved
at
once
to
face
them
boldly
i
am
only
thinking
how
generous
you
are
it
what
i
mean
i
do
know
the
young
lady
and
perhaps
she
like
living
with
an
old
gentleman
in
regard
to
the
other
six
months
i
raise
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
to
five
hundred
pounds
if
she
thinks
well
of
it
she
should
come
here
first
and
let
me
see
her
she
and
her
mother
might
both
come
then
there
was
a
pause
i
should
not
know
how
to
bear
it
i
should
not
indeed
but
let
them
both
come
after
some
farther
delay
this
was
at
last
decided
on
harry
went
away
supremely
happy
and
very
grateful
and
prosper
was
left
to
meditate
on
the
terrible
step
he
had
taken
chapter
lviii
scarborough
death
it
is
a
melancholy
fact
that
barry
when
he
heard
the
last
story
from
tretton
began
to
think
that
his
partner
was
not
so
as
he
had
hitherto
always
regarded
him
as
time
runs
on
such
a
result
generally
takes
place
in
all
close
connections
between
the
old
and
the
young
ten
years
ago
barry
had
looked
up
to
grey
with
a
trustful
respect
words
which
fell
from
grey
were
certainly
words
of
truth
but
they
were
in
barry
then
estimation
words
of
wisdom
also
gradually
an
altered
feeling
had
grown
up
and
barry
though
he
did
not
doubt
the
truth
thought
less
about
it
but
he
did
doubt
the
wisdom
constantly
the
wisdom
practised
under
barry
was
not
quite
the
same
as
grey
and
barry
had
come
to
understand
that
though
it
might
be
well
to
tell
the
truth
on
occasions
it
was
folly
to
suppose
that
any
one
else
would
do
so
he
had
always
thought
that
grey
had
gone
a
little
too
fast
in
believing
squire
scarborough
first
story
but
you
been
to
nice
yourself
and
discovered
that
it
is
true
grey
would
say
barry
would
shake
his
head
and
declare
that
in
having
to
deal
with
a
man
of
such
varied
intellect
as
scarborough
there
was
no
coming
at
the
bottom
of
a
story
but
there
had
been
no
question
of
any
alterations
in
the
mode
of
conducting
the
business
of
the
firm
grey
had
been
of
course
the
partner
by
whose
judgment
any
question
of
importance
must
ultimately
be
decided
and
though
barry
had
been
sent
to
nice
the
scarborough
property
was
especially
in
grey
branch
he
had
been
loud
in
declaring
the
iniquity
of
his
client
but
had
altogether
made
up
his
mind
that
the
iniquity
had
been
practised
and
all
the
clerks
in
the
office
had
gone
with
him
trusting
to
his
great
character
for
sober
sagacity
and
grey
was
not
a
man
who
would
easily
be
put
out
of
his
high
position
the
respect
generally
felt
for
him
was
too
high
and
he
carried
himself
before
his
partner
and
clerks
too
powerfully
to
lose
at
once
his
prestige
but
barry
when
he
heard
the
new
story
looked
at
his
own
favorite
clerk
and
almost
winked
an
eye
and
when
he
came
to
discuss
the
matter
with
grey
he
declined
even
to
pretend
to
be
led
at
once
by
grey
opinion
a
gentleman
who
has
been
so
very
clever
on
one
occasion
may
be
very
clever
on
another
that
had
been
his
argument
grey
reply
had
simply
been
to
the
effect
that
you
can
not
twice
catch
an
old
bird
with
chaff
barry
seemed
however
to
think
in
discussing
the
matter
with
the
favorite
clerk
that
the
older
the
bird
became
the
more
often
he
could
be
caught
with
chaff
grey
in
these
days
was
very
unhappy
not
made
so
simply
by
the
iniquity
of
his
client
but
by
the
insight
which
he
got
into
his
partner
aptitude
for
business
he
began
to
have
his
doubts
about
barry
barry
was
tending
toward
sharp
practice
barry
was
beginning
to
love
his
clients
not
with
a
proper
attorney
affection
as
his
children
but
as
sheep
to
be
shorn
with
grey
the
bills
had
gone
out
and
had
been
paid
no
doubt
and
the
money
had
in
some
shape
found
its
way
into
grey
pockets
but
he
had
never
looked
at
the
two
things
together
barry
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
the
wool
as
every
client
came
or
was
dismissed
grey
as
he
thought
of
these
things
began
to
fancy
that
his
own
style
of
business
was
becoming
antiquated
he
had
said
good
words
of
barry
to
his
daughter
but
just
at
this
period
his
faith
both
in
himself
and
in
his
partner
began
to
fail
his
partner
was
becoming
too
strong
for
him
and
he
felt
that
he
was
failing
things
were
changed
and
he
did
not
love
his
business
as
he
used
to
do
he
had
fancies
and
he
knew
that
he
had
fancies
and
that
fancies
were
not
good
for
an
attorney
when
he
saw
what
was
in
barry
mind
as
to
this
new
story
from
tretton
he
became
convinced
that
dolly
was
right
dolly
was
not
fit
he
thought
to
be
barry
wife
she
might
have
been
the
wife
of
such
another
as
himself
had
the
partner
been
such
another
but
it
was
not
probable
that
any
partner
should
have
been
such
as
he
was
old
times
are
changed
he
said
to
himself
old
manners
gone
then
he
determined
that
he
would
put
his
house
in
order
and
leave
the
firm
a
man
can
not
leave
his
work
forever
without
some
touch
of
melancholy
but
it
was
necessary
that
some
one
should
go
to
rummelsburg
and
find
what
could
be
learned
there
grey
had
sworn
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
new
story
as
soon
as
the
new
story
had
been
told
to
him
but
it
soon
became
apparent
to
him
that
he
must
have
to
do
with
it
as
soon
as
the
breath
should
be
out
of
the
old
squire
body
some
one
must
take
possession
of
tretton
and
mountjoy
would
be
left
in
the
house
in
accordance
with
grey
theory
augustus
would
be
the
proper
possessor
augustus
no
doubt
would
go
down
and
claim
the
ownership
unless
the
matter
could
be
decided
to
the
satisfaction
of
them
both
beforehand
grey
thought
that
there
was
little
hope
of
such
satisfaction
but
it
would
of
course
be
for
him
or
his
firm
to
see
what
could
be
done
that
i
should
ever
have
got
such
a
piece
of
business
he
said
to
himself
but
it
was
at
last
settled
among
them
that
barry
should
go
to
rummelsburg
he
had
made
the
inquiry
at
nice
and
he
would
go
on
with
it
at
rummelsburg
barry
started
with
quaverdale
of
john
the
gentleman
whom
harry
annesley
had
consulted
as
to
the
practicability
of
his
earning
money
by
writing
for
the
press
quaverdale
was
supposed
to
be
a
german
scholar
and
therefore
had
his
expenses
paid
for
him
with
some
bonus
for
his
time
a
conversation
between
barry
and
quaverdale
which
took
place
on
their
way
home
shall
be
given
as
it
will
best
describe
the
result
of
their
inquiry
this
inquiry
had
been
conducted
by
intelligence
but
had
owed
so
much
to
quaverdale
extensive
knowledge
of
languages
that
the
two
gentlemen
may
be
said
as
they
came
home
to
be
equally
well
instructed
in
the
affairs
of
property
he
has
been
too
many
for
the
governor
said
barry
governor
was
grey
it
seems
to
me
that
scarborough
is
a
gentleman
who
is
apt
to
be
too
many
for
most
men
the
sharpest
fellow
i
ever
came
across
either
in
the
way
of
a
cheat
or
in
any
other
walk
of
life
if
he
wanted
any
one
else
to
have
the
property
he
come
out
with
something
to
show
that
the
entail
itself
was
all
moonshine
but
when
he
married
again
at
nice
he
could
have
quarrelled
with
his
eldest
son
already
the
child
was
not
above
four
or
five
months
old
this
came
from
quaverdale
it
my
impression
said
barry
that
it
was
then
his
intention
to
divide
the
property
and
that
this
was
done
as
a
kind
of
protest
against
primogeniture
then
he
found
that
that
would
fail
that
if
he
came
to
explain
the
whole
matter
to
his
sons
they
would
not
consent
to
be
guided
by
him
and
to
accept
a
division
from
what
i
have
seen
of
both
of
them
they
are
bad
to
guide
after
that
fashion
then
mountjoy
got
frightfully
into
the
hands
of
the
and
in
order
to
do
them
it
became
necessary
that
the
whole
property
should
go
to
augustus
they
must
look
upon
him
as
a
nice
sort
of
old
man
said
quaverdale
rather
but
they
have
never
got
at
him
to
speak
a
bit
of
their
mind
to
him
and
then
how
clever
he
was
in
getting
round
his
own
younger
son
the
property
got
into
such
a
condition
that
there
was
money
enough
to
pay
the
jews
the
money
they
had
really
lent
augustus
who
was
never
quite
sure
of
his
father
thought
it
would
be
best
to
disarm
them
and
he
consented
to
pay
them
getting
back
all
their
bonds
but
he
was
very
uncivil
to
the
squire
told
him
that
the
sooner
he
died
the
better
or
something
of
that
sort
and
then
the
squire
immediately
turned
round
and
sprung
this
rummelsburg
marriage
upon
us
and
has
left
every
stick
about
the
place
to
mountjoy
it
must
all
go
to
mountjoy
every
acre
every
horse
every
bed
and
every
book
and
these
in
twelve
months
time
will
have
been
divided
among
the
of
the
metropolis
said
quaverdale
we
got
nothing
to
do
with
that
if
ever
a
man
did
have
a
lesson
he
has
had
it
if
he
chose
to
take
it
no
man
would
ever
have
been
saved
in
so
miraculous
a
manner
but
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
john
scarborough
and
ada
sneyd
were
married
at
rummelsburg
and
that
it
will
be
found
to
be
impossible
to
unmarry
them
old
sneyd
the
lady
mother
was
then
present
said
quaverdale
not
a
doubt
about
it
and
that
fritz
deutchmann
was
present
at
the
marriage
i
almost
think
that
we
ought
to
have
brought
him
away
with
us
it
would
have
cost
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
but
the
estate
can
bear
that
we
can
have
him
by
sending
for
him
if
we
should
want
it
then
after
many
more
words
on
the
same
subject
and
to
the
same
effect
barry
went
on
to
give
his
own
private
opinions
in
fact
the
only
blemish
in
old
scarborough
plans
was
this
that
the
rummelsburg
marriage
was
sure
to
come
out
sooner
or
later
do
you
think
so
fritz
deutchmann
is
the
only
one
of
the
party
alive
and
it
not
probable
that
he
would
ever
have
heard
of
tretton
these
things
always
do
come
out
but
it
does
not
signify
now
and
the
world
will
know
how
godless
and
reprobate
old
scarborough
has
been
but
that
will
not
interfere
with
mountjoy
legitimacy
and
the
world
has
pretty
well
understood
already
that
the
old
man
has
cared
nothing
for
god
or
man
it
was
bad
enough
according
to
the
other
story
that
he
should
have
kept
augustus
so
long
in
the
dark
and
determined
to
give
it
all
to
a
bastard
by
means
of
a
plot
and
a
fraud
the
world
has
got
used
to
that
the
world
will
simply
be
amused
by
this
other
turn
and
as
the
world
generally
is
not
very
fond
of
augustus
scarborough
and
entertains
a
sort
of
a
pity
for
mountjoy
the
first
marriage
will
be
easily
accepted
there
be
a
lawsuit
i
suppose
said
quaverdale
i
do
see
that
they
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
when
the
old
man
dies
the
property
will
be
exactly
as
it
would
have
been
this
latter
intended
fraud
in
favor
of
augustus
will
be
understood
as
having
been
old
scarborough
farce
the
jews
are
the
party
who
have
really
suffered
and
augustus
he
will
have
lost
nothing
to
which
he
was
by
law
entitled
his
father
might
of
course
make
what
will
he
pleased
if
augustus
was
uncivil
to
his
father
his
father
could
of
course
alter
his
will
the
world
would
see
all
that
but
the
world
will
be
inclined
to
say
that
these
poor
have
been
awfully
swindled
the
world
wo
pity
them
i
not
so
sure
it
a
hard
case
to
get
hold
of
a
lot
of
men
and
force
them
to
lend
you
a
hundred
pounds
without
security
and
without
interest
that
what
has
been
done
in
this
case
they
have
no
means
of
recovering
anything
not
a
shilling
the
wonder
is
that
they
should
have
got
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
they
never
would
have
had
it
unless
the
squire
had
wished
to
pave
the
way
back
for
mountjoy
and
then
he
made
augustus
do
it
for
him
in
my
mind
he
has
been
so
clever
that
he
ought
to
be
forgiven
all
his
rascality
there
has
been
too
no
punishment
for
him
and
no
probability
of
punishment
he
has
done
nothing
for
which
the
law
can
touch
him
he
has
proposed
to
cheat
people
but
before
he
would
have
cheated
them
he
might
be
dead
the
will
have
been
swindled
awfully
but
they
have
never
had
any
ground
of
tangible
complaint
against
him
are
you
he
has
said
do
know
you
they
alleged
that
they
had
lent
their
money
to
his
eldest
son
as
you
thought
he
replied
ai
bound
to
come
and
tell
you
all
the
family
arrangements
about
my
marriage
if
you
look
at
it
all
round
it
was
uncommonly
well
done
when
barry
got
back
he
found
that
it
was
generally
admitted
at
the
chambers
that
the
business
had
been
well
done
everybody
was
prepared
to
allow
that
scarborough
had
not
left
a
screw
loose
in
the
arrangement
though
he
was
this
moment
on
his
and
had
been
under
surgical
tortures
and
operations
and
in
fact
slowly
dying
during
the
whole
period
that
he
had
been
thus
busy
every
one
concerned
in
the
matter
seemed
to
admire
scarborough
except
grey
whose
anger
either
with
himself
or
his
client
became
the
stronger
the
louder
grew
the
admiration
of
the
world
a
couple
of
barristers
very
learned
in
the
law
were
consulted
and
they
gave
it
as
their
opinion
that
from
the
evidence
as
shown
to
them
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
mountjoy
was
legitimate
there
was
no
reason
in
the
least
for
doubting
it
but
for
that
strange
episode
which
had
occurred
when
in
order
to
get
the
better
of
the
law
scarborough
had
declared
that
at
the
time
of
mountjoy
birth
he
had
not
been
married
they
went
on
to
declare
that
on
the
squire
death
the
rummelsburg
marriage
must
of
course
have
been
discovered
and
had
given
it
as
their
opinion
that
the
squire
had
never
dreamed
of
doing
so
great
an
injustice
either
to
his
elder
or
his
younger
son
he
had
simply
desired
as
they
thought
to
cheat
the
and
had
cheated
them
beautifully
that
tyrrwhit
should
have
been
so
very
soft
was
a
marvel
to
them
but
it
only
showed
how
very
foolish
a
sharp
man
of
the
world
might
be
when
he
encountered
one
sharper
and
augustus
through
an
attorney
acting
on
his
own
behalf
consulted
two
other
barristers
whose
joint
opinion
was
not
forthcoming
quite
at
once
but
may
have
to
be
stated
augustus
was
declared
by
them
to
have
received
at
his
father
hands
a
most
irreparable
injury
to
such
an
extent
that
an
action
for
damages
would
in
their
opinion
lie
he
had
by
accepting
his
father
first
story
altered
the
whole
course
of
his
life
abandoned
his
profession
and
even
paid
large
sums
of
money
out
of
his
own
pocket
for
the
maintenance
of
his
elder
brother
a
jury
would
probably
award
him
some
very
considerable
sum
if
a
jury
could
get
hold
of
his
father
while
still
living
no
doubt
the
furniture
and
other
property
would
remain
and
might
be
held
to
be
liable
for
the
present
owner
laches
but
these
two
learned
lawyers
did
not
think
that
an
action
could
be
taken
with
any
probability
of
success
against
the
eldest
son
with
reference
to
his
tables
and
chairs
when
the
tretton
estates
should
have
become
his
as
these
learned
lawyers
had
learned
that
old
scarborough
was
at
this
moment
almost
articulo
would
it
not
be
better
that
augustus
should
apply
to
his
elder
brother
to
make
him
such
compensation
as
the
peculiarities
of
the
case
would
demand
but
as
this
opinion
did
not
reach
augustus
till
his
father
was
dead
the
first
alternative
proposed
was
of
no
use
i
suppose
sir
we
had
better
communicate
with
mr
scarborough
barry
said
to
his
partner
on
his
return
not
in
my
name
grey
replied
i
put
scarborough
in
such
a
state
that
he
is
not
allowed
to
see
any
business
letter
sir
william
brodrick
is
there
now
but
communications
were
made
both
to
mountjoy
and
to
augustus
there
was
nothing
for
mountjoy
to
do
his
case
was
in
barry
hands
nor
could
he
take
any
steps
till
something
should
be
done
to
oust
him
from
tretton
augustus
however
immediately
went
to
work
and
employed
his
counsel
learned
in
the
law
you
will
do
something
i
suppose
for
poor
gus
the
old
man
said
to
his
son
one
morning
it
was
the
last
morning
on
which
he
was
destined
to
awake
in
the
world
and
he
had
been
told
by
sir
william
and
by
merton
that
it
would
probably
be
so
but
death
to
him
had
no
terror
life
to
him
for
many
weeks
past
had
been
so
laden
with
pain
as
to
make
him
look
forward
to
a
release
from
it
with
hope
but
the
business
of
life
had
pressed
so
hard
upon
him
as
to
make
him
feel
that
he
could
not
tell
what
had
been
accomplished
the
adjustment
of
such
a
property
as
tretton
required
he
thought
his
presence
and
till
it
had
been
adjusted
he
clung
to
life
with
a
pertinacity
which
had
seemed
to
be
oppressive
now
mountjoy
debts
had
been
paid
and
mountjoy
could
be
left
a
bit
happier
having
achieved
so
much
he
was
delighted
to
think
that
he
might
but
there
had
come
latterly
a
claim
upon
him
equally
strong
that
he
should
wreak
his
vengeance
upon
augustus
had
augustus
abused
him
for
keeping
him
in
the
dark
so
long
he
would
have
borne
it
patiently
he
had
expected
as
much
but
his
son
had
ridiculed
him
laughed
at
him
made
nothing
of
him
and
had
at
last
told
him
to
die
out
of
the
way
he
would
at
any
rate
do
something
before
he
died
he
had
had
his
revenge
very
bitter
of
its
kind
augustus
should
be
made
to
feel
that
he
had
not
been
ridiculous
not
to
be
laughed
at
in
his
last
days
he
had
ruined
his
son
inevitably
ruined
him
and
was
about
to
leave
him
penniless
upon
the
earth
but
now
in
his
last
moments
in
his
very
last
there
came
upon
him
some
feeling
of
pity
and
in
speaking
of
his
son
he
once
more
called
him
gus
i
do
know
how
it
will
all
be
sir
but
if
the
property
is
to
be
mine
it
will
be
yours
it
must
be
yours
then
i
will
do
anything
for
him
that
he
will
accept
do
not
let
him
starve
or
have
to
earn
his
bread
say
what
you
wish
sir
and
it
shall
be
done
as
far
as
i
can
do
it
make
an
offer
to
him
of
some
income
and
settle
it
on
him
do
it
at
once
the
old
man
as
he
said
this
was
thinking
probably
of
the
great
danger
that
all
tretton
might
before
long
have
been
made
to
vanish
and
mountjoy
sir
you
have
gambled
surely
enough
for
amusement
with
such
a
property
as
this
in
your
hands
gambling
becomes
very
serious
they
were
the
last
words
the
last
intelligible
words
which
the
old
man
spoke
he
died
with
his
left
hand
on
his
son
neck
and
took
merton
and
his
sister
by
his
side
it
was
a
not
without
its
lesson
not
without
a
certain
charm
in
the
eyes
of
some
fancied
beholder
those
who
were
there
seemed
to
love
him
well
and
should
do
so
he
had
contrived
in
spite
of
his
great
faults
to
create
a
respect
in
the
minds
of
those
around
him
which
is
itself
a
great
element
of
love
but
there
was
something
in
his
manner
which
told
of
love
for
others
he
was
one
who
could
hate
to
distraction
and
on
whom
no
bonds
of
blood
would
operate
to
mitigate
his
hatred
he
would
persevere
to
injure
with
a
terrible
persistency
but
yet
in
every
phase
of
his
life
he
had
been
actuated
by
love
for
others
he
had
never
been
selfish
thinking
always
of
others
rather
than
of
himself
supremely
indifferent
he
had
been
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
around
him
but
he
had
never
run
counter
to
his
own
conscience
for
the
conventionalities
of
the
law
he
entertained
a
supreme
contempt
but
he
did
wish
so
to
arrange
matters
with
which
he
was
himself
concerned
as
to
do
what
justice
demanded
whether
he
succeeded
in
the
last
year
of
his
life
the
reader
may
judge
but
certainly
the
three
persons
who
were
assembled
around
his
did
respect
him
and
had
been
made
to
love
him
by
what
he
had
done
merton
wrote
the
next
morning
to
his
friend
henry
annesley
respecting
the
scene
the
poor
old
boy
has
gone
at
last
and
in
spite
of
all
his
faults
i
feel
as
though
i
had
lost
an
old
friend
to
me
he
has
been
most
kind
and
did
i
not
know
of
all
his
sins
i
should
say
that
he
had
been
always
loyal
and
always
charitable
grey
condemns
him
and
all
the
world
must
condemn
him
one
can
not
make
an
apology
for
him
without
being
ready
to
throw
all
truth
and
all
morality
to
the
dogs
but
if
you
can
imagine
for
yourself
a
state
of
things
in
which
neither
truth
nor
morality
shall
be
thought
essential
then
old
scarborough
would
be
your
hero
he
was
the
bravest
man
i
ever
knew
he
was
ready
to
look
all
opposition
in
the
face
and
prepared
to
bear
it
down
and
whatever
he
did
he
did
with
the
view
of
accomplishing
what
he
thought
to
be
right
for
other
people
between
him
and
his
god
i
can
not
judge
but
he
believed
in
an
almighty
one
and
certainly
went
forth
to
meet
him
without
a
fear
in
his
heart

while
some
men
die

while
the

was
pealing

at

the
joyful
were

both
at

and

all
in
his

was
about

off
molly
annesley
to
rome
previous
to
settling
down
to
a
comfortable
life
of
hunting
and
brewing
in
his
native
town
miss
thoroughbung
sent
her
compliments
to
annesley
would
her
brother
be
there
she
thought
it
probable
that
prosper
would
not
be
glad
to
see
her
she
longed
to
substitute
peter
for
prosper
but
abstained
in
such
case
she
would
deny
herself
the
pleasure
of
seeing
joe
turned
off
then
there
was
an
embassy
sent
to
the
hall
the
two
younger
girls
went
with
the
object
of
inviting
uncle
prosper
but
with
a
desire
at
their
hearts
that
uncle
prosper
might
not
come
i
presume
the
family
at
buntingford
will
be
represented
uncle
prosper
had
asked
somebody
will
come
i
suppose
said
fanny
then
uncle
prosper
had
sent
down
a
pretty
jewelled
ring
and
said
that
he
would
remain
in
his
room
his
health
hardly
permitted
of
his
being
present
with
advantage
so
it
was
decided
that
miss
thoroughbung
should
come
and
every
one
felt
that
she
would
be
the
howling
spirit
if
not
at
the
ceremony
at
the
banquet
which
would
be
given
afterward
miss
thoroughbung
was
not
the
only
obstacle
had
the
whole
been
known
young
soames
the
son
of
the
attorney
with
whom
prosper
had
found
it
so
evil
a
thing
to
have
to
deal
was
to
act
as
joe
best
man
prosper
learned
this
probably
from
matthew
but
he
never
spoke
of
it
to
the
family
it
was
a
sad
disgrace
in
his
eyes
that
any
soames
should
have
been
so
far
mixed
up
with
the
prosper
blood
young
algy
soames
was
in
himself
a
very
nice
sort
of
young
fellow
who
liked
a
day
hunting
when
he
could
be
spared
out
of
his
father
office
and
whose
worst
fault
was
that
he
wore
loud
cravats
but
he
was
an
abomination
to
prosper
who
had
never
seen
him
as
it
was
he
carried
himself
very
mildly
on
this
occasion
it
a
pity
we
not
to
have
two
marriages
at
the
same
time
said
crabtree
a
clerical
wag
from
the
next
parish
do
you
think
so
mrs
annesley
annesley
was
standing
close
by
as
was
also
miss
thoroughbung
but
she
made
no
answer
to
the
appeal
people
who
understood
anything
knew
that
annesley
would
not
be
gratified
by
such
an
allusion
but
crabtree
was
a
man
who
understood
nothing
the
old
birds
never
pair
so
readily
as
the
young
ones
said
miss
thoroughbung
old
who
talks
of
being
old
said
crabtree
my
friend
prosper
is
quite
a
boy
there
a
good
time
coming
and
i
hope
you
give
way
yet
miss
thoroughbung
then
they
were
all
marshalled
on
their
way
to
church
it
is
quite
out
of
my
power
to
describe
the
bride
dress
or
that
of
the
bride
maids
they
were
the
bride
sisters
and
two
of
joe
sisters
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
induce
florence
mountjoy
to
come
down
but
it
had
been
unsuccessful
things
had
gone
so
far
now
at
cheltenham
that
mountjoy
had
been
driven
to
acknowledge
that
if
florence
held
to
her
project
for
three
years
she
should
be
allowed
to
marry
harry
annesley
but
she
had
accompanied
this
permission
by
many
absurd
restrictions
florence
was
not
to
see
him
at
any
rate
during
the
first
year
but
she
was
to
see
mountjoy
scarborough
if
he
came
to
cheltenham
florence
declared
this
to
be
impossible
but
as
the
buston
marriage
took
place
just
at
this
moment
she
could
not
have
her
way
in
everything
joe
drove
up
to
the
church
with
algy
soames
it
not
having
been
thought
discreet
that
he
should
enter
the
parsonage
on
that
morning
though
he
had
been
there
nearly
every
day
through
the
winter
i
declare
here
he
is
said
miss
thoroughbung
very
loudly
i
never
thought
he
have
the
courage
at
the
last
moment
i
wonder
how
a
certain
gentleman
would
have
felt
when
it
came
to
his
last
moment
said
crabtree
annesley
took
to
weeping
bitterly
which
seemed
to
be
unnecessary
as
she
had
done
nothing
but
congratulate
herself
since
the
match
had
first
been
made
and
had
rejoiced
greatly
that
one
of
her
numerous
brood
should
have
put
into
such
a
haven
of
rest
my
dear
annesley
said
crabtree
consoling
her
in
that
she
would
not
be
far
removed
from
her
child
you
can
almost
see
the
brewery
chimneys
from
the
church
tower
those
who
knew
the
two
ladies
well
were
aware
that
there
was
some
little
slur
intended
by
the
allusion
to
brewery
chimneys
crabtree
girl
had
married
the
third
son
of
sir
reginald
rattlepate
the
rattlepates
were
not
rich
and
the
third
son
was
not
inclined
to
earn
his
bread
thank
god
yes
said
annesley
through
her
tears
whenever
i
shall
see
them
i
shall
know
that
there
an
income
coming
out
with
the
smoke
the
boys
were
home
from
school
for
the
occasion
molly
there
joe
coming
after
you
said
the
elder
if
he
gives
you
a
kiss
now
you
need
pretend
to
mind
said
the
other
my
darling
my
own
one
that
so
soon
will
be
my
own
no
longer
said
the
father
as
he
made
his
way
into
the
vestry
to
put
on
his
surplice
dear
papa
it
was
the
only
word
the
bride
said
as
she
walked
in
at
the
and
prepared
to
make
her
way
up
the
nave
at
the
head
of
her
little
bevy
they
were
all
very
bright
as
they
stood
there
before
the
altar
but
the
brightest
spot
among
them
was
algy
soames
blue
necktie
joe
for
the
moment
was
much
depressed
and
thought
nothing
of
the
last
run
in
which
he
had
distinguished
himself
but
nevertheless
he
held
up
his
head
well
as
a
man
and
a
brewer
take
on
so
miss
thoroughbung
said
to
annesley
at
the
last
moment
he
give
her
plenty
to
eat
and
to
drink
and
will
never
do
her
a
morsel
of
harm
joe
overheard
this
and
wished
that
his
aunt
was
back
in
her
bed
at
marmaduke
lodge
then
the
marriage
was
over
and
they
all
trooped
into
the
vestry
to
sign
the
book
you
ca
get
out
of
that
now
said
crabtree
to
joe
i
do
want
to
i
have
got
the
fairest
girl
in
these
parts
for
my
wife
and
as
i
believe
the
best
young
woman
this
he
said
with
a
spirit
for
which
crabtree
had
not
given
him
credit
and
algy
soames
heard
him
and
admired
his
friend
beneath
his
blue
necktie
and
one
of
the
girls
heard
it
and
cried
tears
of
joy
as
she
told
her
sister
afterward
in
the
bedroom
oh
what
a
darling
he
is
molly
had
said
amid
her
own
sobbing
joe
stood
an
inch
higher
among
them
all
because
of
that
word
then
came
the
breakfast
that
dullest
saddest
hour
of
all
to
feed
heavily
about
twelve
in
the
morning
is
always
a
nuisance
a
nuisance
so
abominable
that
it
should
be
avoided
under
any
other
circumstances
than
a
wedding
in
your
own
family
but
that
when
it
does
come
is
the
worst
of
all
feeding
the
smart
dresses
and
bare
shoulders
seen
there
by
daylight
the
handing
people
in
and
out
among
the
seats
the
very
nature
of
the
food
made
up
of
chicken
and
sweets
and
flummery
the
profusion
of
champagne
not
sometimes
of
the
very
best
on
such
an
occasion
and
then
the
speeches
they
fall
generally
to
the
lot
of
some
gentlemen
who
seem
always
to
have
been
selected
for
their
incapacity
but
there
is
a
worse
trouble
yet
remaining
in
the
unnatural
repletion
which
the
sight
even
of
so
much
food
produces
and
the
fact
that
your
dinner
for
that
day
is
destroyed
utterly
and
forever
crabtree
and
the
two
fathers
made
the
speeches
over
and
beyond
that
which
was
made
by
joe
himself
joe
father
was
not
eloquent
he
brewed
no
doubt
good
beer
without
a
taste
in
it
beyond
malt
and
hops
no
man
in
the
county
brewed
better
beer
but
he
could
make
a
speech
he
got
up
dressed
in
a
big
white
waistcoat
and
a
face
as
red
as
his
and
said
that
he
hoped
his
boy
would
make
a
good
husband
all
he
could
say
was
that
being
a
lover
had
not
helped
to
make
him
a
good
brewer
perhaps
when
molly
annesley
was
brought
nearer
to
buntingford
joe
might
spend
so
much
of
his
time
in
going
to
and
fro
perhaps
joe
might
not
demand
so
much
of
her
attention
this
was
the
great
point
he
made
and
it
was
received
well
by
all
but
the
bride
who
whispered
to
joe
that
if
he
thought
that
he
was
to
be
among
the
brewing
tubs
from
morning
till
night
he
find
he
was
mistaken
annesley
threw
a
word
or
two
of
feeling
into
his
speech
as
is
usual
with
the
father
of
the
young
lady
but
nobody
seemed
to
care
much
for
that
crabtree
was
facetious
with
the
ordinary
wedding
jests
as
might
have
been
expected
seeing
that
he
had
been
present
at
every
wedding
in
the
county
for
the
last
twenty
years
the
elderly
ladies
laughed
and
crabtree
was
heard
to
say
that
the
whole
affair
would
have
been
very
tame
but
that
crabtree
had
carried
it
all
off
but
in
truth
when
joe
got
up
the
fun
of
the
day
had
commenced
for
miss
thoroughbung
though
she
kept
her
chair
was
able
to
utter
as
many
words
as
her
nephew
i
sure
i
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
what
you
all
been
saying
so
you
ought
sir
for
you
have
heard
more
good
of
yourself
than
ever
hear
again
then
i
the
more
obliged
to
you
what
my
people
have
said
about
my
being
so
long
upon
the
road
that
only
just
what
you
have
told
them
at
the
brewery
nobody
knows
where
you
have
been
molly
can
tell
you
all
about
that
i
ca
tell
them
anything
molly
said
in
a
whisper
but
it
comes
only
once
in
a
man
lifetime
continued
joe
and
i
dare
say
if
we
knew
all
about
the
governor
when
he
was
of
my
age
which
i
do
remember
he
was
as
spooney
as
any
one
i
only
saw
him
once
for
six
months
before
he
was
married
said
thoroughbung
in
a
funereal
voice
he
made
up
for
it
since
said
miss
thoroughbung
i
sure
i
very
proud
to
have
got
such
a
young
lady
to
have
come
and
joined
her
lot
with
mine
continued
joe
and
nobody
can
think
more
about
his
wife
family
than
i
do
and
all
buston
said
the
aunt
yes
and
all
buston
i
sure
we
all
sorry
that
the
bride
uncle
from
buston
hall
has
not
been
able
to
come
here
you
ought
to
say
that
joe
yes
i
do
say
it
i
very
sorry
that
prosper
is
able
to
be
here
perhaps
miss
thoroughbung
can
tell
us
something
about
him
said
crabtree
me
i
know
nothing
special
when
i
saw
him
last
he
was
in
good
health
i
did
nothing
to
him
to
make
him
keep
his
bed
crabtree
seems
to
think
that
i
have
got
your
uncle
in
my
keeping
molly
i
beg
to
say
that
i
not
responsible
it
must
be
allowed
that
amid
such
free
conversation
it
was
difficult
for
joe
to
shine
as
an
orator
but
as
he
had
no
such
ambition
perhaps
the
interruptions
only
served
him
but
miss
thoroughbung
witticism
did
throw
a
certain
damp
over
the
it
was
perhaps
to
have
been
expected
that
the
lady
should
take
her
revenge
for
the
injury
done
to
her
it
was
the
only
revenge
that
she
did
take
she
had
been
she
thought
and
yet
she
had
not
put
prosper
to
a
shilling
of
expense
and
there
was
present
to
her
a
feeling
that
the
uncle
had
at
the
last
moment
been
debarred
from
complying
with
her
small
requests
in
favor
of
miss
tickle
and
the
ponies
on
behalf
of
the
young
man
who
was
now
sitting
opposite
to
her
and
that
the
good
things
coming
from
buston
hall
were
to
be
made
to
flow
in
the
way
of
the
annesleys
generally
rather
than
in
her
way
she
did
not
regret
them
very
much
and
it
was
not
in
her
nature
to
be
bitter
but
still
all
those
little
touches
about
prosper
were
pleasant
to
her
and
were
of
course
unpleasant
to
the
annesleys
then
it
will
be
said
she
should
not
have
come
to
partake
of
a
breakfast
in
annesley
that
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
perhaps
miss
thoroughbung
taste
was
not
altogether
refined
joe
speech
came
to
an
end
and
with
it
his
aunt
remarks
but
as
she
left
the
room
she
said
a
few
words
to
annesley
do
suppose
that
i
am
angry
not
in
the
least
certainly
not
with
you
or
harry
i
do
him
a
good
turn
if
i
could
and
so
for
the
matter
of
that
i
would
to
his
uncle
but
you
ca
expect
but
what
a
woman
should
have
her
feelings
and
express
them
annesley
on
the
other
hand
thought
it
strange
that
a
woman
in
such
a
position
should
express
her
feelings
then
at
last
came
the
departure
molly
was
taken
up
into
her
room
and
cried
over
for
the
last
time
i
know
that
i
an
old
fool
oh
mamma
now
dearest
mamma
a
good
husband
is
the
greatest
blessing
that
god
can
send
a
girl
and
i
do
think
that
he
is
good
and
sterling
he
is
mamma
he
is
i
know
he
is
and
when
that
woman
talks
about
brewery
chimneys
i
know
what
a
comfort
it
is
that
there
should
be
chimneys
and
that
they
should
be
near
brewery
chimneys
are
better
than
a
scamp
that
ca
earn
a
meal
for
himself
or
his
children
and
when
i
see
joe
with
his
pink
coat
on
going
to
the
meet
i
thank
god
that
my
molly
has
got
a
lad
that
can
work
hard
and
ride
his
own
horses
and
go
out
hunting
with
the
best
of
them
oh
mamma
i
do
like
to
see
him
then
he
is
handsome
i
would
not
have
anything
altered
but
but
oh
my
child
you
are
going
away
as
crabtree
says
i
be
far
no
no
but
you
wo
be
all
mine
the
time
will
come
when
think
of
your
girls
in
the
same
way
you
have
done
a
thing
that
i
have
seen
and
known
and
pondered
over
you
have
worn
a
skirt
but
what
it
has
been
dear
to
me
you
have
uttered
a
prayer
but
what
i
have
heard
it
as
it
went
up
to
god
throne
i
hope
he
says
his
prayers
i
sure
he
does
said
molly
with
confidence
more
or
less
well
founded
now
go
and
leave
me
here
i
such
an
old
stupid
that
i
ca
help
crying
and
if
that
woman
was
to
say
anything
more
to
me
about
the
chimneys
i
should
give
her
a
bit
of
my
mind
then
molly
went
down
with
her
on
looking
twice
prettier
than
she
had
done
during
the
whole
of
the
morning
ceremonies
it
is
i
suppose
on
the
bridegroom
behalf
that
the
bride
is
put
forth
in
all
her
best
looks
just
as
she
is
about
to
become
for
the
first
time
exclusively
his
own
molly
on
the
present
occasion
was
very
pretty
and
joe
was
very
proud
it
was
not
the
least
of
his
pride
that
he
feeling
himself
to
be
not
quite
as
yet
removed
from
the
bung
to
the
thorough
had
married
into
a
family
by
which
his
ascent
might
be
matured
and
then
as
they
went
came
the
normal
shower
of
rice
to
be
picked
up
in
the
course
of
the
next
hour
by
the
vicarage
fowls
and
not
by
the
london
beggars
and
the
air
was
darkened
by
a
storm
of
old
shoes
in
london
white
satin
slippers
are
the
fashion
but
buston
and
buntingford
combined
could
not
afford
enough
of
such
missiles
and
from
the
hands
of
the
boys
black
shoes
and
boots
too
were
thrown
freely
there
go
my
best
pair
said
one
of
the
boys
as
the
chariot
was
driven
off
and
i
do
mean
to
let
them
lie
there
then
the
boots
were
recovered
and
taken
up
to
the
bedroom
now
that
molly
was
gone
harry
affairs
became
paramount
at
buston
after
all
harry
was
of
superior
importance
to
molly
though
those
chimneys
at
buntingford
could
probably
give
a
better
income
than
the
acres
belonging
to
the
park
but
harry
was
to
be
the
future
prosper
of
the
county
to
assume
at
some
future
time
the
family
name
and
there
was
undoubtedly
present
to
them
all
at
the
parsonage
a
feeling
that
harry
annesley
prosper
would
loom
in
future
years
a
bigger
squire
than
the
parish
had
ever
known
before
he
had
got
a
fellowship
which
no
prosper
had
ever
done
and
he
had
the
look
and
tone
of
a
man
who
had
lived
in
london
which
had
never
belonged
to
the
prospers
generally
and
he
was
to
bring
a
wife
with
a
good
fortune
and
one
of
whom
a
reputation
for
many
charms
had
preceded
her
and
harry
having
been
somewhat
under
a
cloud
for
the
last
six
months
was
now
emerging
from
it
brighter
than
ever
even
uncle
prosper
could
not
do
without
him
that
terrible
miss
thoroughbung
had
thrown
a
gloom
over
buston
hall
which
could
only
be
removed
as
the
squire
himself
had
felt
by
the
coming
of
the
natural
heir
harry
was
indispensable
and
was
no
longer
felt
by
any
one
to
be
a
burden
it
was
now
the
end
of
march
old
scarborough
was
dead
and
buried
and
mountjoy
was
living
at
tretton
nothing
had
been
heard
of
his
coming
up
to
london
no
rushing
to
the
had
been
announced
that
there
were
to
be
some
terrible
internecine
law
contests
between
him
and
augustus
had
been
declared
in
many
circles
but
of
this
nothing
was
known
at
the
buston
rectory
harry
had
been
one
day
at
cheltenham
and
had
been
allowed
to
spend
the
best
part
of
an
hour
with
his
sweetheart
but
this
permission
had
been
given
on
the
understanding
that
he
was
not
to
come
again
and
now
for
a
month
he
had
abstained
then
had
come
his
uncle
offer
that
generous
offer
under
which
harry
was
to
bring
his
wife
to
buston
hall
and
live
there
during
half
the
year
and
to
receive
an
increased
allowance
for
his
maintenance
during
the
other
half
as
he
thought
of
his
ways
and
means
he
fancied
that
they
would
be
almost
rich
she
would
have
four
hundred
a
year
and
he
as
much
and
an
established
home
would
be
provided
for
them
of
all
these
good
things
he
had
written
to
florence
but
had
not
yet
seen
her
since
the
offer
had
been
made
her
answer
had
not
been
as
propitious
as
it
might
be
and
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
he
should
go
down
to
cheltenham
and
settle
things
the
three
years
had
in
his
imagination
been
easily
reduced
to
one
which
was
still
as
he
thought
an
impossible
time
for
waiting
by
degrees
it
came
down
to
six
months
in
his
imagination
and
now
to
three
resulting
in
an
idea
that
they
might
be
easily
married
early
in
june
so
as
to
have
the
whole
of
the
summer
before
them
for
their
mother
he
said
i
shall
be
off
to
cheltenham
yes
to
cheltenham
what
is
the
good
of
waiting
i
think
a
girl
may
be
too
obedient
to
her
mother
it
is
a
fine
feeling
which
you
will
be
glad
to
remember
that
she
possessed
supposing
that
you
had
declared
that
molly
should
have
married
joe
thoroughbung
molly
has
got
a
father
said
annesley
suppose
she
had
none
i
can
not
suppose
anything
so
horrible
as
if
you
and
he
had
joined
together
to
forbid
molly
but
we
did
i
think
a
girl
may
carry
it
too
far
said
harry
mountjoy
has
committed
herself
to
mountjoy
scarborough
and
will
not
go
back
from
her
word
he
has
again
come
back
to
the
fore
and
out
of
a
ruined
man
has
appeared
as
the
rich
proprietor
of
the
town
of
tretton
of
course
the
mother
hangs
on
to
him
still
you
do
think
florence
will
change
not
in
the
least
i
not
a
bit
afraid
of
mountjoy
scarborough
and
all
his
property
but
i
can
see
that
she
may
be
subjected
to
much
annoyance
from
which
i
ought
to
extricate
her
what
can
you
do
harry
go
and
tell
her
so
make
her
understand
that
she
should
put
herself
into
my
hands
at
once
and
that
i
could
protect
her
take
her
away
from
her
mother
by
force
said
annesley
with
horror
if
she
were
once
married
her
mother
would
think
no
more
about
it
i
do
believe
that
mountjoy
has
any
special
dislike
to
me
she
thinks
of
her
own
nephew
and
as
long
as
florence
is
florence
mountjoy
there
will
be
for
her
the
chance
i
know
that
he
has
no
chance
and
i
do
think
that
i
ought
to
leave
her
there
to
be
bullied
for
some
endless
period
of
time
think
of
three
years
of
dooming
a
girl
to
live
three
years
without
ever
seeing
her
lover
there
is
an
absurdity
about
it
which
is
revolting
i
shall
go
down
and
see
if
i
can
not
put
a
stop
to
it
to
this
the
mother
could
make
no
objection
though
she
could
express
no
approval
of
a
project
under
which
florence
was
to
be
made
to
marry
without
her
mother
consent
chapter
lx
scarborough
is
buried
when
scarborough
died
and
when
he
had
been
buried
his
son
mountjoy
was
left
alone
at
tretton
living
in
a
very
desolate
manner
till
the
day
of
the
funeral
merton
the
doctor
had
remained
with
him
and
his
aunt
miss
scarborough
but
when
the
old
squire
had
been
laid
in
his
grave
they
both
departed
miss
scarborough
was
afraid
of
her
nephew
and
could
not
look
forward
to
living
comfortably
at
the
big
house
and
merton
had
the
general
work
of
his
life
to
call
him
away
you
might
as
well
stay
for
another
week
mountjoy
had
said
to
him
but
merton
had
felt
that
he
could
not
remain
at
tretton
without
some
especial
duty
and
he
too
went
his
way
the
funeral
had
been
very
strange
augustus
had
refused
to
come
and
stand
at
his
father
grave
considering
all
things
i
had
rather
decline
he
had
written
to
mountjoy
other
guests
none
were
invited
except
the
tenants
they
came
in
a
body
for
the
squire
had
been
noted
among
them
as
a
liberal
landlord
but
a
crowd
of
tenants
does
not
in
any
way
make
up
that
look
of
family
sorrow
which
is
expected
at
the
funeral
of
such
a
man
as
scarborough
mountjoy
was
there
and
stood
through
the
ceremony
speechless
and
almost
sullen
he
went
down
to
the
church
behind
the
body
with
merton
and
then
walked
away
from
the
ground
without
having
uttered
a
syllable
but
during
the
ceremony
he
had
seen
that
which
caused
him
to
be
sullen
samuel
hart
had
been
there
and
tyrrwhit
and
there
was
a
man
whom
he
called
to
his
mind
as
connected
with
the
names
of
evans
crooke
and
spicer
and
richard
juniper
he
knew
them
all
as
they
stood
there
round
the
grave
not
in
decorous
funeral
array
but
as
strangers
who
had
strayed
into
the
cemetery
he
could
not
but
feel
as
he
looked
at
them
and
they
at
him
that
they
had
come
to
look
after
their
interest
their
heavy
interest
on
the
money
which
had
been
fraudulently
repaid
to
them
he
knew
that
they
had
parted
with
their
bonds
but
he
knew
also
that
almost
all
that
was
now
his
would
have
been
theirs
had
they
not
been
cheated
into
believing
that
he
mountjoy
scarborough
was
not
and
never
would
be
scarborough
of
tretton
park
they
said
nothing
as
they
stood
there
and
did
not
in
any
way
interrupt
the
ceremony
but
they
looked
at
mountjoy
as
they
were
standing
and
their
looks
disconcerted
him
terribly
he
had
declared
that
he
would
walk
back
to
the
house
which
was
not
above
two
miles
distant
from
the
graveyard
and
therefore
when
the
funeral
was
over
there
was
no
carriage
to
take
him
but
he
knew
that
the
men
would
dog
his
steps
as
he
walked
he
had
only
just
got
within
the
precincts
of
the
park
when
he
saw
them
all
but
tyrrwhit
was
by
himself
and
came
up
to
him
what
are
you
going
to
do
captain
scarborough
he
said
as
to
our
claims
you
have
no
claims
of
which
i
am
aware
he
said
roughly
oh
yes
captain
scarborough
we
have
claims
certainly
you
come
up
to
the
front
lately
with
a
deal
of
luck
i
do
begrudge
it
for
one
but
i
have
claims
i
and
those
other
gentlemen
we
have
claims
have
to
admit
that
send
in
the
documents
barry
is
acting
as
my
lawyer
he
is
grey
partner
and
is
now
taking
the
leading
share
in
the
business
i
know
barry
well
a
very
sharp
gentleman
is
mr
barry
i
can
not
enter
into
conversation
with
yourself
at
such
a
time
as
this
we
are
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
then
our
interests
are
so
pressing
what
do
you
mean
to
do
captain
scarborough
that
the
question
yes
with
the
estate
said
samuel
hart
coming
up
and
joining
them
of
the
lot
of
men
samuel
hart
was
the
most
distasteful
to
mountjoy
he
had
last
seen
his
jew
persecutor
at
monte
carlo
and
had
then
as
he
thought
been
grossly
insulted
by
him
what
are
you
hafter
captain
to
this
mountjoy
made
no
answer
but
hart
walking
a
step
or
two
in
advance
turned
upon
his
heels
and
looked
at
the
park
around
him
tidy
sort
of
place
ai
it
tyrrwhit
for
a
gentleman
to
hang
his
up
when
we
were
told
he
was
a
bastard
not
worth
a
shilling
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
all
that
said
mountjoy
you
and
tyrrwhit
held
my
acceptances
for
certain
sums
of
money
they
have
i
believe
been
paid
in
full
no
they
ai
they
ai
been
paid
in
full
at
all
you
knows
they
ai
as
he
said
this
hart
walked
on
in
front
and
stood
in
the
pathway
facing
mountjoy
how
can
you
the
cheek
to
say
we
been
paid
in
full
you
know
it
ai
true
evans
crooke
have
been
paid
so
far
said
a
voice
from
behind
more
ai
spicer
said
another
voice
captain
scarborough
i
have
been
paid
in
full
said
juniper
advancing
to
the
front
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
my
five
hundred
pounds
have
been
paid
in
full
you
ruined
me
captain
scarborough
i
was
to
have
been
married
to
a
young
lady
with
a
large
fortune
your
grey
niece
and
it
has
been
broken
off
altogether
because
of
your
bad
treatment
do
you
mean
to
assert
that
i
have
been
paid
in
full
if
you
have
got
any
document
take
it
to
mr
barry
no
i
wo
i
wo
take
it
to
any
lawyer
i
take
it
right
in
before
the
court
and
expose
you
my
name
is
juniper
and
i
never
parted
with
a
morsel
of
paper
that
has
your
name
to
it
then
no
doubt
you
get
your
money
said
the
captain
i
thought
gentlemen
you
were
to
allow
me
to
be
the
spokesman
on
this
occasion
said
tyrrwhit
we
certainly
can
not
do
any
good
if
we
attack
the
captain
all
at
once
now
captain
scarborough
we
do
want
to
be
uncivil
uncivil
be
blowed
said
hart
i
want
to
get
my
money
and
mean
to
it
i
agreed
as
you
was
to
speak
tyrrwhit
but
i
means
to
be
spoken
up
for
and
if
no
one
else
can
do
it
i
can
do
it
myself
is
we
to
have
any
settlement
made
to
us
or
is
we
to
go
to
law
i
can
only
refer
you
to
barry
said
mountjoy
walking
on
very
rapidly
he
thought
that
when
he
reached
the
house
he
might
be
able
to
enter
in
and
leave
them
out
and
he
thought
also
that
if
he
kept
them
on
the
trot
he
would
thus
prevent
them
from
attacking
him
with
many
words
evans
crooke
were
already
lagging
behind
and
spicer
was
giving
signs
of
being
hard
pressed
even
hart
who
was
younger
than
the
others
was
fat
and
short
and
already
showed
that
he
would
have
to
halt
if
he
made
many
speeches
barry
be
d
d
exclaimed
hart
you
see
how
it
is
captain
scarborough
said
tyrrwhit
your
father
as
has
just
been
laid
to
rest
in
hopes
of
a
a
happy
resurrection
was
a
very
peculiar
gentleman
the
most
hinfernal
swindler
i
ever
tell
of
said
hart
i
do
wish
to
say
a
word
disrespectful
continued
tyrrwhit
but
he
had
his
own
notions
he
said
as
you
was
illegitimate
did
he
now
i
can
only
refer
you
to
barry
said
mountjoy
and
he
said
that
augustus
was
to
have
it
all
and
he
proved
his
words
did
he
now
and
then
he
made
out
that
if
so
our
deeds
were
worth
the
paper
they
were
written
on
is
it
all
true
what
saying
and
then
when
we
taken
what
small
sums
of
money
he
chose
to
offer
us
just
to
save
ourselves
from
ruin
then
he
comes
up
and
says
you
are
the
heir
as
legitimate
as
anybody
else
and
are
to
have
all
the
property
and
he
proves
that
too
what
are
we
to
think
about
it
there
was
nothing
left
for
mountjoy
scarborough
but
to
make
the
pace
as
good
as
possible
hart
tried
once
and
again
to
stop
their
progress
by
standing
in
the
captain
path
but
could
only
do
this
sufficiently
at
each
stoppage
to
enable
him
to
express
his
horror
with
various
interjections
oh
laws
that
such
a
liar
as
should
ever
be
buried
you
ca
do
anything
by
being
disrespectful
hart
said
tyrrwhit
what
is
it
he
means
to
do
ejaculated
spicer
spicer
said
mountjoy
i
mean
to
leave
it
all
in
the
hands
of
barry
and
if
you
will
believe
me
no
good
can
be
done
by
any
of
you
by
hunting
me
across
the
park
hare
you
a
bastard
or
hare
you
ejaculated
hart
no
hart
i
am
not
then
pay
us
what
you
us
you
to
say
as
you
us
tyrrwhit
said
the
captain
it
is
of
no
use
my
answering
hart
because
he
is
angry
by
george
i
angry
i
like
to
pull
that
bones
of
the
ground
but
to
you
i
can
say
that
barry
will
be
better
able
to
tell
you
than
i
am
what
can
be
done
by
me
to
defend
my
property
captain
scarborough
said
tyrrwhit
mildly
we
had
your
name
you
know
we
did
have
your
name
and
my
father
bought
the
bonds
back
oh
laws
and
he
calls
himself
a
shentleman
i
have
nothing
farther
to
say
to
you
now
gentlemen
and
can
only
refer
you
to
mr
barry
the
path
on
which
they
were
walking
had
then
brought
them
to
the
corner
of
a
garden
wall
through
which
a
door
opened
into
the
garden
luckily
at
the
moment
it
occurred
to
mountjoy
that
there
was
a
bolt
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
and
he
entered
it
quickly
and
bolted
the
door
tyrrwhit
was
left
on
the
other
side
and
was
joined
by
his
companions
as
quickly
as
their
failing
breath
enabled
them
to
do
so
a
go
said
hart
striking
the
door
violently
with
the
handle
of
his
stick
he
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
leave
us
when
we
attacked
him
altogether
said
tyrrwhit
if
you
had
left
it
to
me
he
would
have
told
us
what
he
intended
to
do
you
hart
had
not
so
much
cause
to
be
angry
as
you
had
received
a
considerable
sum
for
interest
then
hart
turned
upon
tyrrwhit
and
abused
him
all
the
way
back
to
their
inn
but
it
was
pleasant
to
see
how
these
commercial
gentlemen
all
engaged
in
the
natural
course
of
trade
expressed
their
violent
indignation
not
so
much
as
to
their
personal
losses
but
at
the
commercial
dishonesty
generally
of
which
the
scarboroughs
father
and
son
had
been
and
were
about
to
be
guilty
mountjoy
when
he
reached
the
house
of
which
he
was
now
the
only
occupant
besides
the
servants
stood
for
an
hour
in
the
with
his
back
toward
the
fire
thinking
of
his
position
he
had
many
things
of
which
to
think
in
the
first
place
there
were
these
who
had
just
attacked
him
in
his
own
park
with
much
acrimony
he
endeavored
to
comfort
himself
by
telling
himself
that
they
were
certainly
to
whom
he
did
not
in
fact
owe
a
penny
barry
could
deal
with
them
but
then
his
conscience
reminded
him
that
they
had
in
truth
been
cheated
cheated
by
his
father
for
his
benefit
for
every
pound
which
they
had
received
they
would
have
claimed
three
or
four
they
would
no
doubt
have
cheated
him
but
how
was
he
now
to
measure
the
extent
of
his
father
fraud
against
that
of
his
creditors
and
though
it
would
have
been
right
in
him
to
resist
the
villany
of
these
jews
he
felt
that
it
was
not
fit
that
he
should
escape
from
their
fangs
altogether
by
his
father
deceit
he
had
not
become
so
dead
to
honor
but
that
did
still
live
within
his
bosom
and
yet
there
was
nothing
that
he
could
do
to
absolve
his
bosom
the
income
of
the
estate
was
nearly
clear
the
money
brought
in
by
the
late
sales
having
all
but
sufficed
to
give
these
gentlemen
that
which
his
father
had
chosen
to
pay
them
but
was
he
sure
of
that
income
he
had
just
now
asserted
boldly
that
he
was
the
legitimate
heir
to
the
property
but
did
he
know
that
he
was
so
could
he
believe
his
father
had
not
grey
asserted
that
he
would
not
accept
this
later
evidence
was
he
not
sure
that
augustus
intended
to
proceed
against
him
and
was
he
not
aware
that
nothing
could
be
called
his
own
till
that
lawsuit
should
have
been
decided
if
that
should
be
given
against
him
then
these
harpies
would
have
been
treated
only
too
well
then
there
would
be
no
question
at
any
rate
by
him
as
to
what
might
require
of
him
he
could
take
no
immediate
step
in
regard
to
them
and
therefore
for
the
moment
drove
that
trouble
from
his
mind
but
what
should
he
do
with
himself
as
to
his
future
life
to
be
persecuted
and
abused
by
these
wretched
men
as
had
this
morning
been
his
fate
would
be
intolerable
could
he
shut
himself
up
from
samuel
hart
and
still
live
in
england
and
then
could
he
face
the
clubs
if
the
clubs
would
be
kind
enough
to
him
and
then
there
came
a
dark
frown
across
his
brow
as
he
bethought
himself
that
even
at
this
moment
his
heart
was
longing
to
be
once
more
among
the
cards
could
he
not
escape
to
monaco
and
there
be
happy
among
the
hart
would
surely
not
follow
him
there
and
he
would
be
free
from
the
surveillance
of
that
double
blackguard
his
brother
servant
and
his
father
spy
but
after
all
as
he
declared
to
himself
did
it
not
altogether
turn
on
the
final
answer
which
he
might
get
from
florence
mountjoy
could
florence
be
brought
to
accede
to
his
wishes
he
thought
that
he
might
still
live
happily
respectably
and
in
such
a
manner
that
his
name
might
go
down
to
posterity
not
altogether
blasted
if
florence
would
consent
to
live
at
tretton
then
could
he
remain
there
he
thought
it
over
as
he
stood
there
with
his
back
to
the
fire
and
he
told
himself
that
with
florence
the
first
year
would
be
possible
and
that
after
the
first
year
the
struggle
would
cease
to
be
a
struggle
he
knew
himself
he
declared
and
he
made
all
manner
of
excuses
for
his
former
vicious
life
basing
them
all
on
the
hardness
of
her
treatment
of
him
he
did
not
know
himself
and
such
assurances
were
vain
but
buoyed
up
by
such
assurances
he
resolved
that
his
future
fate
must
be
in
her
hands
and
that
her
word
alone
should
suffice
either
to
destroy
him
or
to
save
him
thinking
thus
of
his
future
life
he
resolved
that
he
would
go
at
once
to
cheltenham
and
throw
himself
and
what
of
tretton
belonged
to
him
at
the
girl
feet
nor
could
he
endure
himself
to
rest
another
night
at
tretton
till
he
had
done
so
he
started
at
once
and
got
late
to
gloucester
where
he
slept
and
on
the
next
morning
at
eleven
was
at
cheltenham
out
on
his
way
to
montpellier
terrace
he
at
once
asked
for
florence
but
circumstances
so
arranged
themselves
that
he
first
found
himself
closeted
with
her
mother
mountjoy
was
delighted
and
yet
shocked
to
see
him
my
poor
brother
she
said
and
he
was
buried
only
yesterday
such
explanation
as
mountjoy
could
give
was
given
he
soon
made
the
whole
tenor
of
his
thoughts
intelligible
to
her
yes
tretton
was
his
at
least
he
supposed
so
as
to
his
future
life
he
could
say
nothing
it
must
depend
on
florence
he
thought
that
if
she
would
promise
to
become
at
once
his
wife
there
would
be
no
more
gambling
he
had
felt
it
to
be
incumbent
on
him
to
come
and
tell
her
so
mountjoy
frightened
by
the
thorough
blackness
of
his
apparel
and
by
the
sternness
of
his
manner
had
not
a
word
to
say
to
him
in
opposition
be
gentle
with
her
she
said
as
she
led
the
way
to
the
room
in
which
florence
was
found
your
cousin
has
come
to
see
you
she
said
has
come
immediately
after
the
funeral
i
hope
you
will
be
gracious
to
him
then
she
closed
the
door
and
the
two
were
alone
together
florence
he
said
mountjoy
we
hardly
expected
you
here
so
soon
where
the
heart
strays
the
body
is
apt
to
follow
i
could
speak
to
no
one
i
could
do
nothing
i
could
hope
and
pray
for
nothing
till
i
had
seen
you
you
can
not
depend
on
me
like
that
she
answered
i
do
depend
on
you
most
entirely
no
human
being
can
depend
more
thoroughly
on
another
it
is
not
my
fortune
that
i
have
come
to
offer
you
or
simply
my
love
but
in
very
truth
my
soul
mountjoy
that
is
wicked
then
wicked
let
it
be
it
is
true
tretton
by
singular
circumstances
is
all
my
own
free
of
debt
at
any
rate
i
and
others
believe
it
to
be
so
tretton
being
all
your
own
can
make
no
difference
i
told
you
that
i
had
not
come
to
offer
you
my
fortune
and
he
almost
scowled
at
her
as
he
spoke
you
know
what
my
career
has
hitherto
been
though
you
do
not
perhaps
know
what
has
driven
me
to
it
shall
i
go
back
and
live
after
the
same
fashion
and
let
tretton
go
to
the
dogs
it
will
be
so
unless
you
take
me
and
tretton
into
your
hands
it
can
not
be
oh
florence
think
of
it
before
you
pronounce
my
doom
it
can
not
be
i
love
you
well
as
my
cousin
and
for
your
sake
i
love
tretton
also
i
would
suffer
much
to
save
you
if
any
suffering
on
my
part
would
be
of
avail
but
it
can
not
be
in
that
fashion
then
he
scowled
again
at
her
mountjoy
you
frighten
me
by
your
hard
looks
but
though
you
were
to
kill
me
you
can
not
change
me
i
am
the
promised
wife
of
harry
annesley
and
for
his
honor
i
must
bid
you
plead
this
cause
no
more
then
just
at
this
moment
there
was
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
a
knock
at
the
door
each
of
them
somewhat
impetuous
and
florence
mountjoy
jumping
up
with
a
start
knew
that
harry
annesley
was
there
chapter
lxi
harry
annesley
is
accepted
she
knew
that
harry
annesley
was
at
the
door
he
had
written
to
say
that
he
must
come
again
though
he
had
fixed
no
day
for
his
coming
she
had
been
delighted
to
think
that
he
should
come
though
she
had
after
her
fashion
scolded
him
for
the
promised
visit
but
though
his
comings
had
not
been
frequent
she
recognized
already
the
sounds
of
his
advent
when
a
girl
really
loves
her
lover
the
very
atmosphere
tells
of
his
whereabouts
she
was
expecting
him
with
almost
breathless
expectation
when
her
cousin
mountjoy
was
brought
to
her
and
so
was
her
mother
who
had
been
told
that
harry
annesley
had
business
on
which
he
intended
to
call
but
now
the
two
foes
must
meet
in
her
presence
that
was
the
idea
which
first
came
upon
her
she
was
sure
that
harry
would
behave
well
why
should
not
a
favored
lover
on
such
occasions
always
behave
well
but
how
would
mountjoy
conduct
himself
when
brought
face
to
face
with
his
rival
as
florence
thought
of
it
she
remembered
that
when
last
they
met
the
quarrel
between
them
had
been
outrageous
and
mountjoy
had
been
the
sinner
while
harry
had
been
made
to
bear
the
punishment
of
the
sin
harry
when
he
was
told
that
miss
mountjoy
was
at
home
had
at
once
walked
in
and
opened
for
himself
the
door
of
the
front
room
downstairs
there
he
found
florence
and
mountjoy
scarborough
mountjoy
was
still
in
her
bedroom
and
was
palpitating
with
fear
as
she
thought
of
the
anger
of
the
two
combative
lovers
to
her
belief
harry
was
of
the
two
the
most
like
to
a
roaring
lion
because
she
had
heard
of
him
that
he
had
roared
so
dreadfully
on
that
former
occasion
but
she
did
not
instantly
go
down
detained
in
her
bedroom
by
the
eagerness
of
her
fear
and
by
the
necessity
of
resolving
how
she
would
behave
when
she
got
there
harry
when
he
entered
stood
a
moment
at
the
door
and
then
hurrying
across
the
room
offered
scarborough
his
hand
i
have
been
so
sorry
he
said
to
hear
of
your
loss
but
your
father
health
was
such
that
you
could
not
have
expected
that
his
life
should
be
prolonged
mountjoy
muttered
something
but
his
mutterings
as
florence
had
observed
were
made
in
courtesy
and
the
two
men
had
taken
each
other
by
the
hand
after
that
they
could
hardly
fly
at
each
other
throats
in
her
presence
then
harry
crossed
to
florence
and
took
her
hand
i
never
get
a
line
from
you
he
said
laughing
but
what
you
scold
me
i
think
i
escape
better
when
i
am
present
so
here
i
am
you
always
make
wicked
propositions
and
of
course
i
scold
you
a
girl
has
to
go
on
scolding
till
she
married
and
then
it
her
turn
to
get
it
no
wonder
then
that
you
talk
of
three
years
so
glibly
i
want
to
be
able
to
scold
you
all
this
was
going
on
in
mountjoy
presence
while
he
stood
by
silent
black
and
scowling
his
position
was
very
difficult
that
of
hearing
the
billing
and
cooing
of
these
lovers
but
theirs
also
was
not
too
easy
which
made
the
billing
and
cooing
necessary
in
his
presence
each
had
to
seem
to
be
natural
but
the
billing
and
cooing
were
in
truth
affected
had
he
not
been
there
would
they
not
have
been
in
each
other
arms
and
would
not
she
have
made
him
the
proudest
man
in
england
by
a
loving
kiss
i
was
asking
miss
mountjoy
when
you
came
in
to
be
my
wife
this
scarborough
said
with
a
loud
voice
looking
harry
full
in
the
face
it
can
not
be
said
florence
i
told
you
that
for
his
honor
and
she
laid
her
hand
on
harry
arm
i
could
listen
to
no
such
request
the
request
has
to
be
made
again
he
said
it
will
be
made
in
vain
said
harry
so
no
doubt
you
think
said
captain
scarborough
you
can
ask
herself
said
harry
of
course
it
will
be
made
in
vain
said
florence
does
he
think
that
a
girl
in
such
a
matter
as
that
of
loving
a
man
can
be
turned
here
and
there
at
a
moment
notice
that
she
can
say
yes
and
no
alternately
to
two
men
it
is
impossible
harry
annesley
has
chosen
me
and
i
am
infinitely
happy
in
his
choice
here
harry
made
an
attempt
to
get
his
arm
round
her
waist
in
which
however
she
prevented
him
seeing
the
angry
passion
rising
in
her
cousin
eyes
he
is
to
be
my
husband
i
hope
i
have
told
him
that
i
love
him
and
i
tell
you
so
also
he
has
my
promise
and
i
can
not
take
it
back
without
perjury
to
him
and
ruin
absolute
ruin
to
myself
all
my
happiness
in
this
world
depends
on
him
he
is
to
me
my
own
one
absolute
master
to
whom
i
have
given
myself
altogether
as
far
as
this
world
goes
even
were
he
to
reject
me
i
could
not
give
myself
to
another
my
florence
my
darling
harry
exclaimed
after
having
told
you
so
much
can
you
ask
your
cousin
to
be
untrue
to
her
word
and
to
her
heart
and
to
become
your
wife
when
her
heart
is
utterly
within
his
keeping
mountjoy
it
is
impossible
what
of
me
then
he
said
rouse
yourself
and
love
some
other
girl
and
marry
her
and
so
do
well
with
yourself
and
with
your
property
you
talk
of
your
heart
he
said
and
you
bid
me
use
my
own
after
such
fashion
as
that
a
man
heart
can
be
changed
but
not
a
woman
his
love
is
but
one
thing
among
many
it
is
the
one
thing
said
harry
then
the
door
opened
and
mountjoy
entered
the
room
oh
dear
oh
dear
she
said
you
both
of
you
here
together
yes
we
are
both
here
together
said
harry
there
was
an
unfortunate
smile
on
his
face
as
he
said
so
which
made
mountjoy
scarborough
very
angry
the
two
men
were
both
handsome
two
as
handsome
men
as
you
shall
see
on
a
summer
day
mountjoy
was
with
whiskers
and
mustaches
with
sparkling
angry
eyes
and
every
feature
of
his
face
well
cut
and
finely
formed
but
there
was
absent
from
him
all
look
of
contentment
or
satisfaction
harry
was
with
long
silken
beard
and
bright
eyes
but
there
was
usually
present
to
his
face
a
look
of
infinite
joy
which
was
comfortable
to
all
beholders
if
not
strong
as
was
the
other
man
it
was
happy
and
eloquent
of
good
temper
but
in
one
thing
they
were
alike
neither
of
them
counted
aught
on
his
good
looks
mountjoy
had
attempted
to
domineer
by
his
bad
temper
and
had
failed
but
harry
without
any
attempt
at
domineering
always
doubting
of
himself
till
he
had
been
assured
of
success
by
her
lips
had
succeeded
now
he
was
very
proud
of
his
success
but
he
was
proud
of
her
and
not
of
himself
you
come
in
here
and
boast
of
what
you
have
done
in
my
presence
said
mountjoy
scarborough
how
can
i
not
seem
to
boast
when
she
tells
me
that
she
loves
me
said
harry
for
god
sake
do
not
quarrel
here
said
mountjoy
they
shall
not
quarrel
at
all
said
florence
there
is
no
cause
for
quarrelling
when
a
girl
has
given
herself
away
there
should
be
an
end
of
it
no
man
who
knows
that
she
has
done
so
should
speak
to
her
again
in
the
way
of
love
i
will
leave
you
now
but
harry
you
must
come
again
in
order
that
i
may
tell
you
that
you
must
not
have
it
all
your
own
way
just
as
you
please
sir
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
and
passing
on
at
once
to
mountjoy
tendered
her
hand
to
him
also
you
are
my
cousin
and
the
head
now
of
my
mother
family
i
would
fain
know
that
you
would
say
a
kind
word
to
me
and
bid
me
speed
he
looked
at
her
but
did
not
take
her
hand
i
can
not
do
it
he
said
i
can
not
bid
you
speed
you
have
ruined
me
trampled
upon
me
destroyed
me
i
am
not
angry
with
him
and
he
pointed
across
the
room
to
harry
annesley
nor
with
you
but
only
with
myself
then
without
speaking
a
word
to
his
aunt
he
marched
out
of
the
room
and
left
the
house
closing
the
after
him
with
a
loud
noise
which
testified
to
his
anger
he
has
gone
said
mountjoy
with
a
tone
of
deep
tragedy
it
is
better
so
said
florence
a
man
must
take
his
chance
in
such
warfare
as
this
said
harry
there
is
something
about
mountjoy
scarborough
that
after
all
i
like
i
do
not
love
augustus
but
with
certain
faults
mountjoy
is
a
good
fellow
he
is
the
head
of
our
family
said
mountjoy
and
is
the
owner
of
tretton
that
is
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
florence
it
has
much
to
do
with
it
said
her
mother
though
you
would
never
listen
to
me
i
had
set
my
heart
upon
it
but
you
have
determined
to
thwart
me
and
yet
there
was
a
time
when
you
preferred
him
to
every
one
else
never
said
florence
with
energy
yes
you
did
before
annesley
here
came
in
the
way
it
was
before
i
came
at
any
rate
said
harry
i
was
young
and
i
did
not
wish
to
be
disobedient
but
i
never
loved
him
and
i
never
told
him
so
now
it
is
out
of
the
question
he
will
never
come
back
again
said
mountjoy
mournfully
i
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
back
when
i
and
florence
are
man
and
wife
i
do
care
how
soon
we
should
see
him
no
he
will
never
come
back
said
florence
not
as
he
came
that
trouble
is
at
last
over
mamma
and
my
trouble
is
going
to
begin
why
should
there
be
any
trouble
harry
will
not
give
you
trouble
will
you
harry
never
i
trust
said
harry
he
can
not
understand
said
mountjoy
he
knows
nothing
of
the
desire
and
ambition
of
my
life
i
had
promised
him
my
child
and
my
word
to
him
is
now
broken
he
will
have
known
mamma
that
you
could
not
promise
for
me
now
go
harry
because
we
are
flurried
may
i
not
ask
him
to
come
here
and
to
drink
tea
with
us
this
she
said
addressing
her
mother
in
a
tone
of
sweetest
entreaty
to
this
mountjoy
unwillingly
yielded
and
then
harry
also
took
his
departure
florence
was
aware
that
she
had
gained
much
by
the
interview
of
the
morning
even
to
her
it
began
to
appear
unnecessary
that
she
should
keep
harry
waiting
three
years
she
had
spoken
of
postponing
the
time
of
her
servitude
and
of
preserving
for
herself
the
masterdom
of
her
own
condition
but
in
that
respect
the
truth
of
her
own
desires
was
well
understood
by
them
all
she
was
anxious
enough
to
submit
to
her
new
master
and
she
felt
that
the
time
was
coming
her
mother
had
yielded
so
much
and
mountjoy
had
yielded
harry
was
saying
to
himself
at
this
very
moment
that
mountjoy
had
thrown
up
the
sponge
she
too
was
declaring
the
same
thing
for
her
own
comfort
in
less
sporting
phraseology
and
what
was
much
more
to
her
her
mother
had
nearly
thrown
up
the
sponge
also
in
the
worse
days
of
her
troubles
any
suitor
had
made
himself
welcome
to
her
mother
who
would
rescue
her
child
from
the
fangs
of
that
roaring
lion
harry
annesley
anderson
had
been
received
with
open
arms
and
even
grascour
mountjoy
had
then
got
it
into
her
head
that
of
all
lions
which
were
about
in
those
days
harry
roared
the
loudest
his
sins
in
regard
to
leaving
poor
mountjoy
speechless
and
motionless
on
the
pavement
had
filled
her
with
horror
but
florence
now
felt
that
all
that
had
come
to
an
end
not
only
had
mountjoy
gone
away
but
no
mention
would
probably
be
ever
again
made
of
anderson
or
grascour
when
florence
was
preparing
herself
for
tea
that
evening
she
sang
a
little
song
to
herself
as
to
the
coming
of
the
conquering
hero
a
man
must
take
his
chance
in
such
warfare
as
this
she
said
repeating
to
herself
her
lover
words
you
ca
expect
me
to
be
very
bright
her
mother
said
to
her
before
harry
came
there
was
a
sign
of
yielding
in
this
also
but
florence
in
her
happiness
did
not
wish
to
make
her
mother
miserable
why
not
be
bright
mamma
do
you
know
that
harry
is
good
no
how
am
i
to
know
anything
about
him
he
may
be
utterly
penniless
but
his
uncle
has
offered
to
let
us
live
in
the
house
and
to
give
us
an
income
prosper
has
abandoned
all
idea
of
getting
married
he
can
be
married
any
day
and
why
do
you
want
to
live
in
another
house
when
you
may
live
in
your
own
tretton
is
ready
for
you
the
finest
mansion
in
the
whole
county
here
mountjoy
exaggerated
a
little
but
some
exaggeration
may
be
allowed
to
a
lady
in
her
circumstances
mamma
you
know
that
i
can
not
live
at
tretton
it
is
the
house
in
which
i
was
born
how
can
that
signify
when
such
things
happen
they
are
used
as
additional
grounds
for
satisfaction
but
i
can
not
marry
your
nephew
because
you
were
born
in
a
certain
house
and
all
that
is
over
now
you
know
that
mountjoy
will
not
come
back
again
he
would
exclaimed
the
mother
as
though
with
new
hopes
oh
mamma
how
can
you
talk
like
that
i
mean
to
marry
harry
annesley
you
know
that
i
do
why
not
make
your
own
girl
happy
by
accepting
him
then
mountjoy
left
the
room
and
went
to
her
own
chamber
and
cried
there
not
bitterly
i
think
but
copiously
her
girl
would
be
the
wife
of
the
squire
of
buston
who
after
all
was
not
a
bad
sort
of
fellow
at
any
rate
he
would
not
gamble
there
had
always
been
that
terrible
drawback
and
he
was
a
fellow
of
his
college
in
which
she
would
look
for
and
probably
would
find
some
compensation
as
to
tretton
when
therefore
she
came
down
to
tea
she
was
able
to
receive
harry
not
with
joy
but
at
least
without
rebuke
conversation
was
at
first
somewhat
flat
between
the
two
if
the
old
lady
could
have
been
induced
to
remain
harry
felt
that
the
evening
would
have
been
much
more
satisfactory
but
as
it
was
he
found
himself
enabled
to
make
some
progress
he
at
once
began
to
address
florence
as
his
undoubted
future
spouse
very
slyly
using
words
adapted
for
that
purpose
and
she
without
any
outburst
of
her
intention
as
she
had
made
when
discussing
the
matter
with
her
cousin
answered
him
in
the
same
spirit
and
by
degrees
came
so
to
talk
as
though
the
matter
were
entirely
settled
and
then
at
last
that
future
day
was
absolutely
brought
on
the
tapis
as
though
now
to
be
named
three
years
ejaculated
mountjoy
as
though
not
even
yet
surrendering
her
last
hope
florence
from
the
nature
of
the
circumstances
received
this
in
silence
had
it
been
ten
years
she
might
have
expostulated
but
a
young
lady
bashfulness
was
bound
to
appear
satisfied
with
an
assurance
of
marriage
within
three
years
but
it
was
otherwise
with
harry
good
god
mountjoy
we
shall
all
be
dead
he
cried
out
mountjoy
showed
by
her
countenance
that
she
was
extremely
shocked
oh
harry
said
florence
none
of
us
i
hope
will
be
dead
in
three
years
i
shall
be
a
great
deal
too
old
to
be
married
if
i
am
left
alive
three
months
you
mean
it
will
be
just
the
proper
time
of
year
which
does
go
for
something
and
three
months
is
always
supposed
to
be
long
enough
to
allow
a
girl
to
get
her
new
frocks
you
know
nothing
about
it
harry
said
florence
and
so
the
matter
was
discussed
in
such
a
manner
that
when
harry
took
his
departure
that
evening
he
was
half
inclined
to
sing
a
song
of
himself
about
the
conquering
hero
dear
mamma
said
florence
kissing
her
mother
with
all
the
warm
clinging
affection
of
former
years
it
was
very
pleasant
but
still
mountjoy
went
to
her
room
with
a
sad
heart
when
there
she
sat
for
a
while
over
the
fire
and
then
drew
out
her
desk
she
had
been
beaten
absolutely
beaten
and
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
own
so
much
in
writing
to
one
person
so
she
wrote
her
letter
which
was
as
follows
dear
mountjoy
after
all
it
can
not
be
as
i
would
have
had
it
as
they
say
proposes
but
god
disposes
i
would
have
given
her
to
you
now
and
would
even
yet
have
trusted
that
you
would
have
treated
her
well
had
it
not
been
that
annesley
has
gained
such
a
hold
upon
her
affections
she
is
wilful
as
you
are
and
i
can
not
bend
her
it
has
been
the
longing
of
my
heart
that
you
two
should
live
together
at
tretton
but
such
longings
are
i
think
wicked
and
are
seldom
realized
i
write
now
just
this
one
line
to
tell
you
that
it
is
all
settled
i
have
not
been
strong
enough
to
prevent
such
settling
he
talks
of
three
months
but
what
does
it
matter
three
months
or
three
years
will
be
the
same
to
you
and
nearly
the
same
to
me
your
affectionate
aunt
sarah
mountjoy
may
i
as
your
loving
aunt
add
one
word
of
passionate
entreaty
all
tretton
is
yours
now
and
the
honor
of
tretton
is
within
your
keeping
do
not
go
back
to
those
wretched
tables
mountjoy
scarborough
when
he
received
this
letter
can
not
be
said
to
have
been
made
unhappy
by
it
because
he
had
already
known
all
his
unhappiness
but
he
turned
it
in
his
mind
as
though
to
think
what
would
now
be
the
best
course
of
life
open
to
him
and
he
did
think
that
he
had
better
go
back
to
those
tables
against
which
his
aunt
had
warned
him
and
there
remain
till
he
had
made
the
acres
of
tretton
utterly
disappear
there
was
nothing
for
him
which
seemed
to
be
better
and
here
at
home
in
england
even
that
would
at
present
be
impossible
to
him
he
could
not
enter
the
clubs
and
elsewhere
samuel
hart
would
be
ever
at
his
heels
and
there
was
his
brother
with
his
lawsuit
though
on
that
matter
a
compromise
had
already
been
offered
to
him
augustus
had
proposed
to
him
by
his
lawyer
to
share
tretton
he
would
never
share
tretton
his
brother
should
have
an
income
secured
to
him
but
he
would
keep
tretton
in
his
own
hands
as
long
as
the
would
allow
him
he
was
in
truth
a
wretched
man
as
on
that
night
he
did
make
up
his
mind
and
ringing
his
bell
called
his
servant
out
of
his
bed
to
bid
him
prepare
everything
for
a
sudden
start
he
would
leave
tretton
on
the
following
day
or
on
the
day
after
and
intended
at
once
to
go
abroad
he
is
off
for
that
place
nigh
to
italy
where
they
have
the
said
the
butler
on
the
following
morning
to
the
valet
who
declared
his
master
intentions
i
should
wonder
stokes
said
the
valet
i
told
it
a
beauteous
country
and
i
should
like
to
see
a
little
of
that
sort
of
life
myself
alas
alas
within
a
week
from
that
time
captain
scarborough
might
have
been
seen
seated
in
the
monte
carlo
room
without
any
friendly
samuel
hart
to
stand
over
him
and
guard
him
chapter
lxii
the
last
of
grey
i
have
put
in
my
last
appearance
at
the
old
chamber
in
lincoln
inn
fields
said
grey
on
arriving
home
one
day
early
in
june
papa
you
do
mean
it
said
dolly
i
do
why
not
one
day
as
well
as
another
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
it
is
to
be
so
i
have
been
thinking
of
it
for
the
last
six
weeks
it
is
done
now
but
you
have
not
told
me
well
yes
i
have
told
you
all
that
was
necessary
it
has
come
now
a
little
sudden
that
is
all
you
will
never
go
back
again
well
i
may
look
in
barry
will
be
lord
and
master
at
any
rate
he
wo
be
my
lord
and
master
said
dolly
showing
by
the
tone
of
her
voice
that
the
matter
had
been
again
discussed
by
them
since
the
last
conversation
which
was
recorded
and
had
been
settled
to
her
father
satisfaction
no
you
at
least
will
be
left
to
me
but
the
fact
is
i
can
not
have
any
farther
dealings
with
the
affairs
of
scarborough
the
old
man
who
is
dead
was
too
many
for
me
though
i
call
him
old
he
was
ever
so
much
younger
than
i
am
barry
says
he
was
the
best
lawyer
he
ever
knew
as
things
go
now
a
man
has
to
be
accounted
a
fool
if
he
attempts
to
run
straight
barry
does
not
tell
me
that
i
have
been
a
fool
but
he
clearly
thinks
so
do
you
care
what
barry
thinks
or
says
yes
i
do
in
regard
to
the
professional
position
which
i
hold
he
is
confident
that
mountjoy
scarborough
is
his
father
eldest
legitimate
son
and
he
believes
that
the
old
squire
simply
was
anxious
to
supersede
him
to
get
some
cheap
arrangement
made
as
to
his
debts
i
supposed
that
was
the
case
before
but
what
am
i
to
think
of
such
a
man
barry
speaks
of
him
almost
with
affection
how
am
i
to
get
on
with
such
a
man
as
mr
barry
he
himself
is
honest
well
yes
i
believe
so
but
he
does
not
hate
the
absolute
utter
roguery
of
our
own
client
and
that
is
not
quite
all
when
the
story
of
the
rummelsburg
marriage
was
told
i
did
not
believe
one
word
of
it
and
i
said
so
most
strongly
i
did
not
at
first
believe
the
story
that
there
had
been
no
such
marriage
and
i
swore
to
scarborough
that
i
would
protect
mountjoy
and
mountjoy
creditors
against
any
such
scheme
as
that
which
was
intended
then
i
was
convinced
all
the
details
of
the
nice
marriage
were
laid
before
me
it
was
manifest
that
the
lady
had
submitted
to
be
married
in
a
public
manner
and
with
all
regular
forms
while
she
had
a
baby
as
it
were
in
her
arms
and
i
got
all
the
dates
taking
that
marriage
for
granted
mountjoy
was
clearly
illegitimate
and
i
was
driven
so
to
confess
then
i
took
up
arms
on
behalf
of
augustus
augustus
was
a
thoroughly
bad
fellow
a
bully
and
a
tyrant
but
he
was
the
eldest
son
then
came
the
question
of
paying
the
debts
i
thought
it
a
very
good
thing
that
the
debts
should
be
payed
in
the
proposed
fashion
the
men
were
all
to
get
the
money
they
had
actually
lent
and
no
better
arrangement
seemed
to
be
probable
i
helped
in
that
feeling
that
it
was
all
right
but
it
was
a
swindle
that
i
was
made
to
assist
in
of
course
it
was
a
swindle
if
the
rummelsburg
marriage
be
true
and
all
these
creditors
think
that
i
have
been
a
party
to
it
then
i
swore
that
i
would
believe
the
rummelsburg
marriage
but
barry
and
the
rest
of
them
only
shake
their
heads
and
laugh
and
i
am
told
that
scarborough
was
the
best
lawyer
among
us
what
does
it
matter
how
can
that
hurt
you
asked
dolly
it
does
hurt
me
that
is
the
truth
i
have
been
at
my
business
long
enough
another
system
has
grown
up
which
does
not
suit
me
i
feel
that
they
all
can
put
their
fingers
in
my
eyes
it
may
be
that
i
am
a
fool
and
that
my
idea
of
honesty
is
a
mistake
no
shouted
dolly
i
heard
of
a
rich
american
the
other
day
who
had
been
poor
and
was
asked
how
he
had
suddenly
become
so
well
off
found
a
partner
said
the
american
we
went
into
business
together
he
had
the
capital
and
i
had
the
experience
we
just
made
a
change
he
has
the
experience
now
and
i
have
the
capital
when
i
knew
that
story
i
went
to
strip
his
coat
off
the
wretch
back
but
barry
would
give
him
a
fine
fur
cloak
as
a
mark
of
respect
when
i
find
that
clever
rascals
are
respectable
i
think
it
is
time
that
i
should
give
up
work
altogether
thus
it
was
that
grey
left
the
house
of
grey
barry
driven
to
premature
retirement
by
the
vices
or
rather
frauds
of
old
scarborough
when
augustus
went
to
work
which
he
did
immediately
on
his
father
death
to
wrest
the
property
from
the
hands
of
his
brother
or
what
part
of
the
property
might
be
possible
grey
absolutely
declined
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
case
barry
explained
how
impossible
it
was
that
the
house
even
for
its
own
sake
should
absolutely
secede
from
all
consideration
of
the
question
mountjoy
had
been
left
in
possession
and
according
to
all
the
evidence
now
before
them
was
the
true
owner
of
course
he
would
want
a
lawyer
and
as
barry
said
would
be
very
well
able
to
pay
for
what
he
wanted
it
was
necessary
that
the
firm
should
protect
themselves
against
the
vindictiveness
of
tyrrwhit
and
samuel
hart
should
the
firm
fail
to
do
so
it
would
leave
itself
open
to
all
manner
of
evil
calumnies
the
firm
had
been
so
long
employed
on
behalf
of
the
scarboroughs
that
now
when
the
old
squire
was
dead
it
could
not
afford
to
relinquish
the
business
till
this
final
great
question
had
been
settled
it
was
necessary
as
barry
said
that
they
should
see
it
out
barry
taking
a
much
more
leading
part
in
these
discussions
than
had
been
his
wont
consequently
grey
had
told
him
that
he
might
do
it
himself
and
barry
had
been
quite
contented
barry
in
talking
the
matter
over
with
one
of
the
clerks
whom
he
afterward
took
into
partnership
expressed
his
opinion
that
poor
old
grey
was
altogether
off
the
hooks
old
grey
had
always
been
grey
when
spoken
of
by
barry
till
that
day
and
the
clerk
remarking
this
left
grey
bell
unanswered
for
three
or
four
minutes
grey
though
he
was
quite
willing
to
shelf
himself
understood
it
all
and
knocked
them
about
in
the
chambers
that
afternoon
with
unwonted
severity
he
said
nothing
about
it
when
he
came
home
that
evening
but
the
next
day
was
the
last
on
which
he
took
his
accustomed
chair
what
will
you
do
with
yourself
papa
dolly
said
to
him
the
next
morning
do
with
myself
what
employment
will
you
take
in
hand
one
has
to
think
of
that
and
to
live
accordingly
if
you
would
like
to
turn
farmer
we
must
live
in
the
country
certainly
i
shall
not
do
that
i
need
not
absolutely
throw
away
what
money
i
have
saved
or
if
you
were
fond
of
shooting
or
hunting
you
know
very
well
i
never
shot
a
bird
and
hardly
ever
crossed
a
horse
in
my
life
but
you
are
fond
of
gardening
have
i
got
garden
enough
here
quite
enough
if
you
think
so
but
will
there
be
occupation
sufficient
in
that
to
find
you
employment
for
all
your
life
i
shall
read
it
seems
to
me
she
said
that
reading
becomes
wearisome
as
an
only
pursuit
unless
you
made
yourself
accustomed
to
it
i
have
as
much
employment
as
you
a
woman
is
so
different
darning
will
get
through
an
unlimited
number
of
hours
a
new
set
of
underclothing
will
occupy
me
for
a
fortnight
turning
the
big
girl
dresses
over
there
into
frocks
for
the
little
girls
is
sufficient
to
keep
my
mind
in
employment
for
a
month
then
i
have
the
to
look
after
and
to
guard
against
their
lovers
i
have
the
dinners
to
provide
and
to
see
that
the
cook
does
not
give
the
fragments
to
the
policeman
i
have
been
brought
up
to
do
these
things
and
habit
has
made
them
usual
occupations
to
me
i
never
envied
you
when
you
had
to
encounter
all
scarborough
vagaries
but
i
knew
that
they
sufficed
to
give
you
something
to
do
they
have
sufficed
said
he
to
leave
me
without
anything
that
i
can
do
you
must
not
allow
yourself
to
be
so
left
you
must
find
out
some
employment
then
they
sat
silent
for
a
time
while
grey
occupied
himself
with
some
of
the
numerous
papers
which
it
would
be
necessary
that
he
should
hand
over
to
barry
and
now
said
dolly
carroll
will
have
gone
out
and
i
will
go
over
to
the
terrace
i
have
to
see
them
every
day
and
carroll
has
the
decency
to
take
himself
off
to
some
so
as
to
make
room
for
me
what
are
they
doing
about
that
man
said
grey
about
the
lover
juniper
has
i
fancy
made
himself
extremely
disagreeable
not
satisfying
himself
with
abusing
you
and
me
but
poor
aunt
as
well
and
all
the
girls
he
has
i
fancy
got
some
money
of
his
own
he
has
had
money
paid
to
him
by
captain
scarborough
but
that
i
should
fancy
would
rather
make
him
in
a
good
humor
than
the
reverse
he
is
only
in
a
good
humor
i
take
it
when
he
has
something
to
get
however
i
must
be
off
now
or
the
legitimate
period
of
uncle
absence
will
be
over
grey
when
he
was
left
alone
at
once
gave
up
the
manipulation
of
his
papers
and
throwing
himself
back
into
his
chair
began
to
think
of
that
future
life
of
which
he
had
talked
so
easily
to
his
daughter
what
should
he
do
with
himself
he
believed
that
he
could
manage
with
his
books
for
two
hours
a
day
but
even
of
that
he
was
not
sure
he
much
doubted
whether
for
many
years
past
the
time
devoted
to
reading
in
his
own
house
had
amounted
to
one
hour
a
day
he
thought
that
he
could
employ
himself
in
the
garden
for
two
hours
but
that
would
fail
him
when
there
should
be
hail
or
fierce
sunshine
or
frost
or
snow
or
rain
eating
and
drinking
would
be
much
to
him
but
he
could
not
but
look
forward
to
if
eating
and
drinking
were
to
be
the
joy
of
his
life
then
he
thought
of
dolly
life
how
much
purer
and
better
and
nobler
it
had
been
than
his
own
she
talked
in
a
slighting
careless
tone
of
her
usual
day
work
but
how
much
of
her
time
had
been
occupied
in
doing
the
tasks
of
others
he
knew
well
that
she
disliked
the
carrolls
she
would
speak
of
her
own
dislike
of
them
as
of
her
great
sin
of
which
it
was
necessary
that
she
should
repent
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
but
yet
how
she
worked
for
the
family
turning
old
dresses
into
new
frocks
as
though
the
girls
who
had
worn
them
and
the
children
who
were
to
wear
them
had
been
to
her
her
dearest
friends
every
day
she
went
across
to
the
house
intent
upon
doing
good
offices
and
this
was
the
repentance
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
which
she
exacted
from
herself
could
not
he
do
as
she
did
he
could
not
darn
minnie
and
brenda
stockings
but
he
might
do
something
to
make
those
children
more
worthy
of
their
cousin
care
he
could
not
associate
with
his
because
he
was
sure
that
carroll
would
not
endure
his
society
but
he
might
labor
to
do
something
for
the
reform
even
of
this
abominable
man
before
dolly
had
come
back
to
him
he
had
resolved
that
he
could
only
redeem
his
life
from
the
stagnation
with
which
it
was
threatened
by
working
for
others
now
that
the
work
of
his
own
life
had
come
to
a
close
well
dolly
he
said
as
soon
as
she
had
entered
the
room
have
you
heard
any
thing
more
about
mr
juniper
have
you
been
here
ever
since
papa
yes
indeed
i
used
to
sit
at
chambers
for
six
or
seven
hours
at
a
stretch
almost
without
getting
out
of
my
chair
and
are
you
still
employed
about
those
awful
papers
i
have
not
looked
at
them
since
you
left
the
room
then
you
must
have
been
asleep
no
indeed
i
have
not
been
asleep
you
left
me
too
much
to
think
of
to
enable
me
to
sleep
what
am
i
to
do
with
myself
besides
eating
and
drinking
so
that
i
shall
not
sleep
always
on
this
side
of
the
grave
there
are
twenty
things
papa
thirty
fifty
for
a
man
so
minded
as
you
are
this
she
said
trying
to
comfort
him
i
must
endeavor
to
find
one
or
two
of
the
fifty
then
he
went
back
to
his
papers
and
really
worked
hard
on
that
day
on
the
following
morning
early
he
went
across
to
bolsover
terrace
to
begin
his
task
of
reproving
the
carroll
family
without
saying
a
word
to
dolly
indicative
of
his
purpose
he
found
that
the
task
would
be
difficult
and
as
he
went
he
considered
within
his
mind
how
best
it
might
be
accomplished
he
had
put
a
in
his
pocket
without
giving
it
much
thought
but
before
he
knocked
at
the
door
he
had
assured
himself
that
the
would
not
be
of
avail
he
would
not
know
how
to
begin
to
use
it
and
felt
that
it
would
be
ridiculed
he
must
leave
that
to
dolly
or
to
the
clergyman
he
could
talk
to
the
girls
but
they
would
not
care
about
the
affairs
of
the
firm
and
in
truth
he
did
not
know
what
they
would
care
about
with
dolly
he
could
hold
sweet
converse
as
long
as
she
would
remain
with
him
but
he
had
been
present
at
the
bringing
up
of
dolly
and
did
think
that
gifts
had
been
given
to
dolly
which
had
not
fallen
to
the
lot
of
the
carroll
girls
they
all
want
to
be
married
he
said
to
himself
and
that
at
any
rate
is
a
legitimate
desire
with
this
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
when
it
was
opened
by
sophia
he
found
an
old
gentleman
with
black
cotton
gloves
and
a
doubtful
white
cravat
just
preparing
for
his
departure
there
was
amelia
then
giving
him
his
hat
and
looking
as
pure
and
proper
as
though
she
had
never
been
winked
at
by
prince
chitakov
then
the
mother
came
through
from
the
parlor
into
the
passage
oh
john
how
very
kind
of
you
to
come
matterson
pray
let
me
introduce
you
to
my
brother
grey
john
this
is
the
rev
matterson
a
clergyman
who
is
a
very
intimate
friend
of
amelia
me
ma
why
me
in
particular
well
my
dear
because
it
is
so
i
suppose
it
is
so
because
matterson
likes
you
the
best
laws
ma
what
nonsense
matterson
appeared
to
be
a
very
shy
gentleman
and
only
anxious
to
escape
from
the
but
grey
remembered
that
in
former
days
before
the
coming
of
juniper
upon
the
scene
he
had
heard
of
a
clerical
admirer
he
had
been
told
that
the
gentleman
name
was
matterson
that
he
was
not
very
young
nor
very
rich
that
he
had
five
or
six
children
and
that
he
could
afford
to
marry
if
the
wife
could
bring
with
her
about
one
hundred
pounds
a
year
he
had
not
then
thought
much
of
matterson
and
no
direct
appeal
had
been
made
to
him
after
that
juniper
had
come
forward
and
then
juniper
had
been
altogether
abolished
but
it
occurred
to
grey
that
matterson
was
at
any
rate
better
than
juniper
that
he
was
by
profession
a
gentleman
and
that
there
might
be
a
beginning
of
those
good
deeds
by
which
he
was
anxious
to
make
the
evening
of
his
days
bearable
to
himself
i
am
delighted
to
make
matterson
acquaintance
he
said
as
that
old
gentleman
scrambled
out
of
the
door
then
his
sister
took
him
by
the
arm
and
led
him
at
once
into
the
parlor
you
might
as
well
come
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
amelia
so
the
daughter
followed
them
in
he
is
the
most
praiseworthy
gentleman
you
ever
knew
john
began
carroll
a
clergyman
i
think
oh
yes
he
is
in
orders
in
priest
orders
said
carroll
meaning
to
make
the
most
of
matterson
he
has
a
church
over
at
putney
i
am
glad
of
that
said
grey
yes
indeed
though
it
is
very
good
because
it
only
a
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
yes
he
does
have
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
something
out
of
the
surplice
fees
another
one
hundred
pounds
i
believe
it
is
said
amelia
not
quite
so
much
as
that
my
dear
but
it
is
something
he
is
a
widower
with
children
i
believe
said
grey
there
are
children
five
of
them
the
prettiest
little
dears
one
ever
saw
the
eldest
is
just
about
thirteen
this
was
a
fib
because
carroll
knew
that
the
eldest
boy
was
sixteen
but
what
did
it
signify
amelia
is
so
warmly
attached
to
them
it
is
a
settled
thing
then
we
hope
so
it
can
not
be
said
to
be
quite
settled
because
there
are
always
money
difficulties
poor
matterson
must
have
some
increase
to
his
income
before
he
can
afford
it
ah
yes
you
did
say
something
uncle
about
five
hundred
pounds
said
amelia
four
hundred
and
fifty
my
dear
said
grey
oh
i
had
forgotten
i
did
say
that
i
hoped
there
would
be
five
hundred
there
shall
be
five
hundred
said
grey
remembering
that
now
had
come
the
time
for
doing
to
one
of
the
carroll
family
the
good
things
of
which
he
had
thought
to
himself
as
matterson
is
a
clergyman
of
whom
i
have
heard
nothing
but
good
it
shall
be
five
hundred
he
had
in
truth
heard
nothing
either
good
or
bad
respecting
matterson
then
he
asked
amelia
to
take
a
walk
with
him
as
he
went
home
reflecting
that
now
had
come
the
time
in
which
a
little
wholesome
conversation
might
have
its
effect
and
an
idea
entered
his
head
that
in
his
old
age
an
acquaintance
with
a
neighboring
clergyman
might
be
salutary
to
himself
so
amelia
got
her
bonnet
and
walked
home
with
him
is
he
an
eloquent
preacher
my
dear
but
amelia
had
never
heard
him
preach
i
suppose
there
will
be
plenty
for
you
to
do
in
your
new
home
i
do
mean
to
be
put
upon
if
you
mean
that
uncle
but
five
children
there
is
a
servant
who
looks
after
them
of
course
i
shall
have
to
see
to
matterson
own
things
but
i
have
told
him
i
can
not
slave
for
them
all
the
three
eldest
have
to
be
sent
somewhere
that
has
been
agreed
upon
he
has
got
an
unmarried
sister
who
can
quite
afford
to
do
as
much
as
that
then
she
explained
her
reasons
for
the
marriage
papa
is
getting
quite
unbearable
and
sophy
spoils
him
in
everything
poor
grey
when
his
niece
turned
and
went
back
home
thought
that
as
far
as
the
girl
was
concerned
or
her
future
household
there
would
be
very
little
room
for
employment
for
him
matterson
wanted
an
upper
servant
who
instead
of
demanding
wages
would
bring
a
little
money
with
her
and
he
could
not
but
feel
that
the
poor
clergyman
would
find
that
he
had
taken
into
his
house
a
bad
and
expensive
upper
servant
never
mind
papa
said
dolly
we
will
go
on
and
persevere
and
if
we
intend
to
do
good
good
will
come
of
it
chapter
lxiii
the
last
of
augustus
scarborough
when
old
scarborough
was
dead
and
had
been
for
a
while
buried
augustus
made
his
application
in
form
to
grey
barry
he
made
it
through
his
own
attorney
and
had
now
received
barry
answer
through
the
same
attorney
the
nature
of
the
application
had
been
in
this
wise
that
augustus
scarborough
had
been
put
in
to
the
position
of
the
eldest
son
that
he
did
not
himself
in
the
least
doubt
that
such
was
his
true
position
that
close
inquiry
had
been
made
at
the
time
and
that
the
lawyers
including
grey
and
barry
had
assented
to
the
statements
as
then
made
by
old
scarborough
that
he
himself
had
then
gone
to
work
to
pay
his
brother
debts
for
the
honor
of
the
family
and
had
paid
them
partly
out
of
his
own
immediate
pocket
and
partly
out
of
the
estate
which
was
the
same
as
his
own
property
that
during
his
brother
abeyance
he
had
assisted
in
his
maintenance
and
on
his
brother
return
had
taken
him
to
his
own
home
that
then
his
father
had
died
and
that
this
incredible
new
story
had
been
told
augustus
scarborough
was
in
no
way
desirous
of
animadverting
on
his
memory
but
was
forced
to
repeat
his
belief
that
he
was
his
eldest
son
and
was
in
fact
at
that
moment
the
legitimate
owner
of
tretton
in
accordance
with
the
existing
contract
he
did
not
wish
to
dispute
his
father
will
though
his
father
mental
and
bodily
condition
at
the
time
of
the
making
of
the
will
might
perhaps
enable
him
to
do
so
with
success
the
will
might
be
allowed
to
pass
valid
but
the
rights
of
primogeniture
must
be
held
sacred
nevertheless
having
his
mother
memory
in
great
honor
he
felt
himself
ill
inclined
to
drag
the
family
history
before
the
public
for
his
mother
sake
he
was
open
to
a
compromise
he
would
advise
that
the
whole
property
that
which
would
pass
under
the
entail
and
that
which
was
intended
to
be
left
by
will
should
be
valued
and
that
the
total
should
then
be
divided
between
them
if
his
brother
chose
to
take
the
family
mansion
it
should
be
so
augustus
scarborough
had
no
desire
to
set
himself
over
his
brother
but
if
this
offer
were
not
accepted
he
must
at
once
go
to
law
and
prove
that
their
nice
marriage
had
been
in
fact
the
one
marriage
by
which
his
father
and
mother
had
been
joined
together
there
was
another
proviso
added
to
this
offer
as
the
valuation
and
division
of
the
property
must
take
time
an
income
at
the
rate
of
two
hundred
pounds
a
month
should
be
allowed
to
augustus
till
such
time
as
it
should
be
completed
such
was
the
offer
which
augustus
had
authorized
his
attorney
to
make
there
was
some
delay
in
getting
mountjoy
to
consent
to
a
reply
before
the
offer
had
reached
barry
he
was
already
at
monte
carlo
with
that
ready
money
his
father
had
left
behind
him
at
every
venture
that
he
made
at
least
at
every
loss
which
he
incurred
he
told
himself
that
it
was
altogether
the
doings
of
florence
mountjoy
but
he
returned
to
england
and
consented
to
a
reply
he
was
the
eldest
son
and
meant
to
support
that
position
both
on
his
mother
behalf
and
on
his
own
as
to
his
father
will
made
in
his
favor
he
felt
sure
that
his
brother
would
not
have
the
hardihood
to
dispute
it
a
man
bodily
sufferings
were
no
impediment
to
his
making
a
will
of
mental
incapacity
he
had
never
heard
his
father
accused
till
the
accusation
had
now
been
made
by
his
own
son
he
was
however
well
aware
that
it
would
not
be
preferred
as
to
what
his
brother
had
done
for
himself
it
was
hardly
worth
his
while
to
answer
such
an
allegation
his
memory
carried
him
but
little
farther
back
than
the
day
on
which
his
brother
turned
him
out
of
his
rooms
there
were
however
many
reasons
and
this
was
put
in
at
the
suggestion
of
barry
why
he
would
not
wish
that
his
brother
should
be
left
penniless
if
his
brother
would
be
willing
to
withdraw
altogether
from
any
lawsuit
and
would
lend
his
to
a
speedy
arrangement
of
the
family
matters
a
thousand
a
year
or
thousand
pounds
should
be
made
over
to
him
as
a
younger
brother
portion
to
this
offer
it
would
be
necessary
that
a
speedy
reply
should
be
given
and
under
such
circumstances
no
temporary
income
need
be
supplied
it
was
early
in
june
when
augustus
was
sitting
in
his
luxurious
lodgings
in
victoria
street
contemplating
this
reply
his
own
lawyer
had
advised
him
to
accept
the
offer
but
he
had
declared
to
himself
a
dozen
times
since
his
father
death
that
in
this
matter
of
the
property
he
would
either
make
a
spoon
or
spoil
a
horn
and
the
lawyer
was
no
friend
of
his
own
was
not
a
man
who
knew
nothing
of
the
facts
of
the
case
beyond
what
were
told
him
and
nothing
of
the
working
of
his
client
mind
augustus
had
looked
to
him
only
for
the
law
in
the
matter
and
the
lawyer
had
declared
the
law
to
be
against
his
client
all
that
your
father
said
about
the
nice
marriage
will
go
for
nothing
it
will
be
shown
that
he
had
an
object
but
there
certainly
was
such
a
marriage
no
doubt
there
was
some
ceremony
performed
with
an
object
a
second
marriage
can
not
invalidate
the
first
though
it
may
itself
be
altogether
invalidated
the
rummelsburg
marriage
is
and
will
be
an
established
fact
and
of
the
rummelsburg
marriage
your
brother
was
no
doubt
the
issue
accept
the
offer
of
an
income
of
course
we
can
come
to
terms
as
to
the
amount
and
from
your
brother
character
it
is
probable
enough
that
he
may
increase
it
such
had
been
his
lawyer
advice
and
augustus
was
sitting
there
in
his
lodging
thinking
of
it
he
was
not
a
happy
man
as
he
sat
there
in
the
first
place
he
owed
a
little
money
and
the
debt
had
come
upon
him
chiefly
from
his
lavish
expenditure
in
maintaining
mountjoy
and
mountjoy
servant
upon
their
travels
at
that
time
he
had
thought
that
by
lavish
expenditure
he
might
make
tretton
certainly
his
own
he
had
not
known
his
character
and
had
thought
that
by
such
means
he
could
keep
him
down
with
his
head
well
under
water
his
brother
might
drink
take
to
drinking
regularly
at
monte
carlo
or
some
other
place
and
might
so
die
or
he
would
surely
gamble
himself
into
farther
and
utter
ruin
at
any
rate
he
would
be
well
out
of
the
way
and
augustus
in
his
pride
had
been
glad
to
feel
that
he
had
his
brother
well
under
his
thumb
then
the
debt
had
been
paid
with
the
object
of
saving
the
estate
from
litigation
on
the
part
of
the
creditors
that
had
been
his
one
great
mistake
and
he
had
not
known
his
father
or
his
father
guile
or
his
strength
why
had
not
his
father
died
at
once
as
all
the
world
had
assured
him
would
be
the
case
looking
back
he
could
remember
that
the
idea
of
paying
the
creditors
had
at
first
come
from
his
father
simply
as
a
vague
idea
oh
what
a
crafty
rascal
his
father
had
been
and
then
he
had
allowed
himself
in
his
pride
to
insult
his
father
and
had
spoken
of
his
father
coming
death
as
a
thing
that
was
desirable
from
that
moment
his
father
had
plotted
his
ruin
he
could
see
it
all
now
he
was
still
minded
to
make
the
spoon
but
he
found
that
he
should
spoil
the
horn
had
there
been
any
one
to
assist
him
he
would
still
have
persevered
he
thought
that
he
could
have
persevered
with
a
lawyer
who
would
really
have
taken
up
his
case
with
interest
if
mountjoy
could
be
made
to
drink
so
as
to
die
he
was
still
next
in
the
entail
and
he
was
his
brother
heir
should
his
brother
die
without
a
will
but
so
he
would
be
if
he
took
the
thousand
pounds
but
to
accept
so
poor
a
modicum
would
go
frightfully
against
the
grain
with
him
he
seemed
to
think
that
by
taking
the
allowance
he
would
bring
back
his
brother
to
all
the
decencies
of
life
he
would
have
to
surrender
altogether
that
feeling
of
conscious
superiority
which
had
been
so
much
to
him
d
n
the
fellow
he
exclaimed
to
himself
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
were
in
that
fellow
pay
the
first
fellow
here
was
the
lawyer
and
the
second
was
his
brother
when
he
had
sat
there
alone
for
half
an
hour
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
when
all
his
debts
were
paid
he
would
not
have
much
above
thousand
pounds
his
father
had
absolutely
extracted
five
thousand
pounds
from
him
toward
paying
his
brother
debts
the
money
had
been
wanted
immediately
together
with
the
sum
coming
from
the
new
purchasers
father
and
son
must
each
subscribe
five
thousand
pounds
to
pay
those
jews
so
it
had
been
represented
to
him
and
he
had
borrowed
the
money
to
carry
out
his
object
had
ever
any
one
been
so
swindled
so
cruelly
treated
this
might
probably
be
explained
and
the
five
thousand
pounds
might
be
added
to
the
thousand
pounds
but
the
explanation
would
be
necessary
and
all
his
pride
would
rebel
against
it
on
that
night
when
by
chance
he
had
come
across
his
brother
bleeding
and
still
half
drunk
as
he
was
about
to
enter
his
lodging
how
completely
under
his
thumb
he
had
been
and
now
he
was
offering
him
of
his
bounty
this
wretched
pittance
then
with
curses
he
execrated
the
names
of
his
father
his
brother
of
grey
and
of
barry
and
of
his
own
lawyer
at
that
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
his
bosom
friend
septimus
jones
entered
the
room
at
any
rate
this
friend
was
the
nearest
he
had
to
his
bosom
he
was
a
man
without
friends
in
the
true
sense
there
was
no
one
who
knew
the
innermost
wishes
of
his
heart
the
secret
desires
of
his
soul
there
are
thus
so
many
who
can
divulge
to
none
those
secret
wishes
and
how
can
such
a
one
have
a
friend
who
can
advise
him
as
to
what
he
shall
do
scarcely
can
the
honest
man
have
such
a
friend
because
it
is
so
difficult
for
him
to
find
a
man
who
will
believe
in
him
augustus
had
no
desire
for
such
a
friend
but
he
did
desire
some
one
who
would
do
his
bidding
as
though
he
were
such
a
friend
he
wanted
a
friend
who
would
listen
to
his
words
and
act
as
though
they
were
the
truth
septimus
jones
was
the
man
he
had
chosen
but
he
did
not
in
the
least
believe
in
septimus
jones
himself
what
does
that
man
say
asked
septimus
jones
the
man
was
the
lawyer
of
whom
augustus
was
now
thinking
at
this
very
moment
all
manner
of
evil
d
n
him
said
augustus
with
all
my
heart
but
what
does
he
say
as
you
are
to
pay
him
for
what
he
says
it
is
worth
while
listening
to
it
there
was
a
tone
in
the
voice
of
septimus
jones
which
declared
at
once
some
diminution
of
his
usual
respect
so
it
sounded
at
least
to
augustus
he
was
no
longer
the
assured
heir
of
tretton
and
in
this
way
he
was
to
be
told
of
the
failure
of
his
golden
hopes
it
would
be
odd
he
thought
if
he
could
not
still
hold
his
dominion
over
septimus
jones
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
shall
listen
to
him
or
to
you
either
as
for
that
you
can
do
as
you
like
of
course
i
can
do
as
i
like
then
he
remembered
that
he
must
still
use
the
man
as
a
messenger
if
in
no
other
capacity
of
course
he
wants
to
compromise
it
a
lawyer
always
proposes
a
compromise
he
can
not
be
beat
that
way
and
it
is
safe
for
him
you
had
agreed
to
that
but
what
are
the
terms
to
be
that
is
the
question
i
made
my
offer
half
and
half
nothing
fairer
can
be
imagined
unless
indeed
i
choose
to
stand
out
for
the
whole
property
but
what
does
your
brother
say
he
could
not
use
his
friend
even
as
a
messenger
without
telling
him
something
of
the
truth
when
i
think
of
it
of
this
injustice
i
can
hardly
hold
myself
he
proposes
to
give
me
thousand
pounds
thousand
pounds
for
everything
everything
yes
what
the
devil
do
you
suppose
i
mean
now
just
listen
to
me
then
he
told
his
tale
as
he
thought
that
it
ought
to
be
told
he
recapitulated
all
the
money
he
had
spent
on
his
brother
behalf
and
all
that
he
chose
to
say
that
he
had
spent
he
painted
in
glowing
colors
the
position
in
which
he
would
have
been
put
by
the
nice
marriage
he
was
both
angry
and
pathetic
about
the
creditors
and
he
tore
his
hair
almost
with
vexation
at
the
treatment
to
which
he
was
subjected
i
think
i
take
the
thousand
pounds
said
jones
never
i
rather
starve
first
that
about
what
you
have
to
do
if
all
that
you
tell
me
is
true
there
was
again
that
tone
of
disappearing
subjection
i
be
shot
if
i
would
take
the
money
then
there
was
a
pause
could
you
do
that
and
go
to
law
with
him
afterward
that
was
what
your
father
would
have
done
yes
but
augustus
had
to
acknowledge
that
he
was
not
as
clever
as
his
father
at
last
he
gave
jones
a
commission
jones
was
to
see
his
brother
and
to
explain
to
him
that
before
any
question
could
be
raised
as
to
the
amount
to
be
paid
under
the
compromise
a
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
must
be
handed
to
augustus
to
reimburse
him
for
money
out
of
pocket
then
jones
was
to
say
as
out
of
his
own
head
that
he
thought
that
augustus
might
probably
accept
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
lieu
of
thousand
pounds
that
would
still
leave
the
bulk
of
the
property
to
mountjoy
although
mountjoy
must
be
aware
of
the
great
difficulties
which
would
be
thrown
in
his
way
by
his
father
conduct
but
jones
had
to
come
back
the
next
day
with
an
intimation
that
mountjoy
had
again
gone
abroad
leaving
full
authority
with
barry
jones
was
sent
to
barry
but
without
effect
barry
would
discuss
the
matter
with
the
lawyer
or
if
augustus
was
so
pleased
with
himself
but
he
was
sure
that
no
good
would
be
done
by
any
conversation
with
jones
a
month
went
on
two
months
went
by
and
nothing
came
of
it
it
is
no
use
your
coming
here
scarborough
at
last
barry
said
to
him
with
but
scant
courtesy
we
are
perfectly
sure
of
our
ground
there
is
not
a
penny
due
you
not
a
penny
if
you
will
sign
certain
documents
which
i
would
advise
you
to
do
in
the
presence
of
your
own
lawyer
there
will
be
thousand
pounds
for
you
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
say
that
i
can
not
see
you
again
on
the
subject
unless
you
accept
your
brother
liberality
at
this
time
augustus
was
very
short
of
money
and
as
is
always
the
case
those
to
whom
he
owed
aught
became
pressing
as
his
readiness
to
pay
them
gradually
receded
but
to
be
so
spoken
to
by
a
lawyer
he
scarborough
of
tretton
as
he
had
all
but
been
to
be
so
addressed
by
a
man
whom
he
had
regarded
as
old
grey
clerk
was
bitter
indeed
he
had
been
so
exalted
by
that
nice
marriage
had
been
so
lifted
high
in
the
world
that
he
was
now
absolutely
prostrate
he
quarrelled
with
his
lawyer
and
he
quarrelled
also
with
septimus
jones
there
was
no
one
with
whom
he
could
discuss
the
matter
or
rather
no
one
who
would
discuss
it
with
him
on
his
terms
so
at
last
he
accepted
the
money
and
went
daily
into
the
city
in
order
that
he
might
turn
it
into
more
what
became
of
him
in
the
city
it
is
hardly
the
province
of
this
chronicle
to
tell
chapter
lxiv
the
last
of
florence
mountjoy
now
at
last
in
this
chapter
has
to
be
told
the
fate
of
florence
mountjoy
as
far
as
it
can
be
told
in
these
pages
it
was
at
any
rate
her
peculiarity
to
attach
to
herself
by
bonds
which
could
not
easily
be
severed
those
who
had
once
thought
that
they
might
be
able
to
win
her
love
an
attempt
has
been
made
to
show
how
firm
and
determined
were
the
affections
of
harry
annesley
and
how
absolutely
he
trusted
in
her
word
when
once
it
had
been
given
to
him
he
had
seemed
to
think
that
when
she
had
even
nodded
to
him
in
answer
to
his
assertion
that
he
desired
her
to
be
his
wife
all
his
trouble
as
regarded
her
heart
had
been
off
his
mind
there
might
be
infinite
trouble
as
to
time
as
to
ten
years
three
years
or
even
one
year
trouble
in
inducing
her
to
promise
that
she
would
become
his
wife
in
opposition
to
her
mother
but
he
had
felt
sure
that
she
never
would
be
the
wife
of
any
one
else
how
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
mitigating
the
opposition
of
her
mother
so
as
to
make
the
three
years
or
even
the
one
year
appear
to
himself
an
altogether
impossible
delay
the
reader
knows
how
he
at
last
contrived
to
have
his
own
way
altogether
so
that
as
florence
told
him
she
was
merely
a
ball
in
his
hand
the
reader
will
have
to
know
very
shortly
but
not
a
shade
of
doubt
had
ever
clouded
harry
mind
as
to
his
eventual
success
since
she
had
nodded
to
him
at
armitage
ball
though
this
girl
love
had
been
so
grand
a
thing
to
have
achieved
he
was
quite
sure
from
that
moment
that
it
would
be
his
forever
with
mountjoy
scarborough
there
had
never
come
such
a
moment
and
never
could
yet
he
had
been
very
confident
so
that
he
had
lived
on
the
assurance
that
such
a
moment
would
come
and
the
natural
to
her
had
been
such
that
he
had
shown
his
assurance
he
never
would
have
succeeded
but
he
should
not
the
less
love
her
sincerely
and
when
the
time
came
for
him
to
think
what
he
should
do
with
himself
those
few
days
after
his
father
death
he
turned
to
her
as
his
one
prospect
of
salvation
if
his
cousin
florence
would
be
good
to
him
all
might
yet
be
well
he
had
come
by
that
time
to
lose
his
assurance
he
had
recognized
harry
annesley
as
his
enemy
as
has
been
told
often
enough
in
these
pages
harry
was
to
him
a
hateful
and
he
had
not
been
quite
as
sure
of
her
fidelity
to
another
as
harry
had
been
sure
of
it
to
himself
tretton
might
prevail
trettons
do
so
often
prevail
and
the
girl
mother
was
all
on
his
side
so
he
had
gone
to
cheltenham
true
as
the
needle
to
the
pole
to
try
his
luck
yet
once
again
he
had
gone
to
cheltenham
and
there
he
found
harry
annesley
all
hopes
for
him
were
then
over
and
he
started
at
once
for
monaco
or
as
he
himself
told
himself
for
the
devil
among
the
lovers
of
florence
some
memory
may
attach
itself
to
poor
hugh
anderson
he
too
had
been
absolutely
true
to
florence
from
the
hour
in
which
he
had
first
conceived
the
idea
that
she
would
make
him
happy
as
his
wife
it
had
gone
on
growing
upon
him
with
all
the
weight
of
love
he
did
not
quite
understand
why
he
should
have
loved
her
so
dearly
but
thus
it
was
such
a
hugh
anderson
with
a
pair
of
horses
on
the
boulevards
was
to
his
imagination
the
most
lovely
sight
which
could
be
painted
then
florence
took
the
mode
of
disabusing
him
which
has
been
told
and
hugh
anderson
gave
the
required
promise
alas
in
what
an
unfortunate
moment
had
he
done
so
such
was
his
own
thought
for
though
he
was
sure
of
his
own
attachment
to
her
he
could
not
mount
high
enough
to
be
as
sure
of
her
to
somebody
else
it
was
a
sort
of
thing
a
man
ought
to
have
been
asked
to
promise
he
said
to
the
third
secretary
and
having
so
determined
he
made
up
his
mind
to
follow
her
to
england
and
to
try
his
fortune
once
again
florence
had
just
wished
harry
for
the
day
or
rather
for
the
week
she
cared
for
nothing
now
in
the
way
of
protestations
of
affection
come
harry
there
now
do
be
so
unreasonable
am
not
i
just
as
impatient
as
you
are
this
day
fortnight
you
will
be
back
and
then
then
there
will
be
some
peace
wo
there
but
mind
you
write
every
day
and
so
harry
was
whisked
away
as
triumphant
a
man
as
ever
left
cheltenham
by
the
london
train
on
the
following
morning
hugh
anderson
reached
cheltenham
and
appeared
in
montpellier
place
my
daughter
is
at
home
certainly
said
mountjoy
there
was
something
in
the
tone
which
made
the
young
man
at
once
assure
himself
that
he
had
better
go
back
to
brussels
he
had
even
been
a
favorite
with
mountjoy
in
his
days
of
poor
mountjoy
had
been
absent
declared
no
longer
to
have
a
chance
of
tretton
and
harry
had
been
the
very
evil
one
himself
mountjoy
had
been
assured
by
the
brussels
mountjoy
that
with
the
view
of
getting
well
rid
of
the
evil
one
she
had
better
take
poor
anderson
to
her
bosom
she
had
opened
her
bosom
accordingly
but
with
very
poor
results
and
now
he
had
come
to
look
after
what
result
there
might
be
mountjoy
felt
that
he
had
better
go
back
to
brussels
could
i
not
see
her
asked
anderson
well
yes
you
could
see
her
mountjoy
i
tell
you
everything
just
as
though
you
were
my
own
mother
i
have
loved
your
daughter
oh
i
do
know
how
it
is
if
be
my
wife
for
two
years
i
do
think
i
mind
dying
afterward
oh
mr
anderson
i
would
i
never
heard
of
a
case
where
a
girl
had
got
such
a
hold
of
a
man
as
she
has
of
me
you
do
mean
to
say
that
she
has
behaved
badly
oh
no
she
could
behave
badly
it
is
in
her
but
she
can
bowl
a
fellow
over
in
the
most
well
most
desperate
manner
as
for
me
i
not
worth
my
salt
since
i
first
saw
her
when
i
go
to
ride
with
the
governor
i
have
a
word
to
say
to
him
but
this
ended
in
mountjoy
going
and
promising
that
she
would
send
florence
down
in
her
place
she
knew
that
it
would
be
in
vain
but
to
a
young
man
who
had
behaved
so
well
as
anderson
so
much
could
not
be
refused
here
i
am
again
he
said
very
much
like
punch
in
the
pantomime
oh
anderson
how
do
you
do
a
lover
who
is
anxious
to
prevail
with
a
lady
should
always
hold
up
his
head
where
is
the
writer
of
novels
or
of
human
nature
who
does
not
know
as
much
as
that
and
yet
the
man
who
is
in
love
truly
in
love
never
does
hold
up
his
head
very
high
it
is
the
man
who
is
not
in
love
who
does
so
nevertheless
it
does
sometimes
happen
that
the
true
lover
obtains
his
reward
in
this
case
it
was
not
observed
to
be
so
but
now
anderson
was
sure
of
his
fate
so
that
there
was
no
encouragement
to
him
to
make
any
attempt
at
holding
up
his
head
i
have
come
once
more
to
see
you
he
said
i
am
sure
it
gives
mamma
so
much
pleasure
mountjoy
is
very
kind
but
it
has
been
for
her
the
truth
is
i
could
settle
down
in
this
world
without
having
another
interview
what
am
i
to
say
mr
anderson
i
just
tell
you
how
it
all
is
you
know
what
my
prospects
are
she
did
not
quite
remember
but
she
bowed
to
him
you
must
know
because
i
told
you
there
is
nothing
i
kept
concealed
again
she
bowed
there
can
be
no
possible
family
reason
for
my
going
to
kamtchatka
kamtchatka
yes
indeed
the
the
always
meant
the
foreign
office
the
wants
a
young
man
on
whom
it
can
thoroughly
depend
to
go
to
kamtchatka
the
allowances
are
handsome
enough
but
the
allowances
are
nothing
to
me
why
should
you
go
it
is
for
you
to
decide
yes
you
can
detain
me
if
i
go
to
that
bleak
and
barren
desert
it
will
merely
be
to
court
exile
from
that
quarter
of
the
globe
in
which
you
and
i
would
have
to
live
together
and
not
separate
that
i
can
not
stand
in
kamtchatka
well
there
is
no
knowing
what
may
happen
to
me
then
but
i
engaged
to
be
married
to
mr
annesley
you
told
me
something
of
that
before
but
it
all
fixed
mamma
will
tell
you
it
to
be
this
day
fortnight
if
you
only
stay
and
come
as
one
of
my
friends
surely
such
a
proposition
as
this
is
the
unkindest
that
any
young
lady
can
make
but
we
believe
that
it
is
made
not
unfrequently
in
the
present
case
it
received
no
reply
anderson
took
up
his
hat
and
rushed
to
the
door
then
he
returned
for
a
moment
god
bless
you
miss
mountjoy
he
said
in
spite
of
the
cruelty
of
that
suggestion
i
must
bid
god
bless
you
and
then
he
was
gone
about
a
week
afterward
grascour
appeared
upon
the
scene
with
precisely
the
same
intention
he
too
retained
in
his
memory
a
most
vivid
recollection
of
the
young
lady
and
her
charms
he
had
heard
that
captain
scarborough
had
inherited
tretton
and
had
been
informed
that
it
was
not
probable
that
miss
florence
mountjoy
would
marry
her
cousin
he
was
somewhat
confused
in
his
ideas
and
thought
that
were
he
now
to
on
the
scene
there
might
still
be
a
chance
for
him
there
was
no
lover
more
unlike
anderson
than
grascour
not
even
for
florence
mountjoy
not
even
to
own
her
would
he
go
to
kamtchatka
and
were
he
not
to
see
her
he
would
simply
go
back
to
brussels
and
yet
he
loved
her
as
well
as
he
knew
how
to
love
any
one
and
would
she
have
become
his
wife
would
have
treated
her
admirably
he
had
looked
at
it
all
round
and
could
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
marry
her
like
a
persevering
man
he
persevered
but
as
he
did
so
no
glimmering
of
an
idea
of
kamtchatka
disturbed
him
but
from
this
farther
trouble
mountjoy
was
able
to
save
her
daughter
grascour
made
his
way
into
mountjoy
presence
and
there
declared
his
purpose
he
had
been
sent
over
on
some
question
connected
with
the
literature
of
commerce
and
had
ventured
to
take
the
opportunity
of
coming
down
to
cheltenham
he
hoped
that
the
truth
of
his
affection
would
be
evinced
by
the
journey
mountjoy
had
observed
while
he
was
making
his
little
speech
how
extremely
well
brushed
was
his
hat
she
had
observed
also
that
poor
anderson
hat
was
in
such
a
condition
as
almost
to
make
her
try
to
smooth
it
down
for
him
if
you
make
objection
to
my
hat
you
should
brush
it
yourself
she
had
heard
harry
say
to
florence
and
florence
had
taken
the
hat
and
had
brushed
it
with
fond
lingering
touches
grascour
i
can
assure
you
that
she
is
really
engaged
mountjoy
had
said
grascour
bowed
and
sighed
she
is
to
be
married
this
day
week
indeed
to
harry
annesley
i
remember
the
gentleman
name
i
had
thought
well
yes
there
were
objections
but
they
have
luckily
disappeared
though
mountjoy
was
only
as
yet
happy
in
a
melancholy
manner
rejoicing
with
but
bated
joy
at
her
girl
joys
she
was
too
loyal
to
say
a
word
now
against
harry
annesley
i
should
not
have
troubled
you
but
i
am
sure
of
that
grascour
and
we
are
both
of
us
grateful
to
you
for
your
good
opinion
i
know
very
well
how
high
is
the
honor
which
you
are
doing
florence
and
she
will
quite
understand
it
but
you
see
the
thing
is
fixed
it
only
a
week
florence
was
said
at
the
moment
to
be
not
at
home
though
she
was
looking
at
four
dozen
new
which
had
just
come
from
the
merchant
with
the
letters
upon
them
she
had
much
more
pleasure
in
looking
at
them
than
she
would
have
had
in
listening
to
the
congratulations
of
grascour
he
a
very
good
man
no
doubt
mamma
a
deal
better
perhaps
than
harry
that
however
was
not
her
true
opinion
but
one
ca
marry
all
the
good
men
there
was
almost
more
trouble
taken
down
at
buston
about
marriage
than
his
sister
though
harry
was
to
be
married
at
cheltenham
and
only
his
father
and
one
of
his
sisters
as
a
maid
were
to
go
down
to
assist
upon
the
occasion
his
father
was
to
marry
them
and
his
mother
had
at
last
consented
to
postpone
the
joy
of
seeing
florence
till
she
was
brought
home
from
her
travels
a
bride
three
months
old
nevertheless
a
great
fuss
was
made
especially
at
buston
hall
prosper
had
become
comparatively
light
in
heart
since
the
duty
of
providing
a
wife
for
buston
and
a
future
mother
for
buston
heirs
had
been
taken
off
his
shoulders
and
thrown
upon
those
of
his
nephew
the
more
he
looked
back
upon
the
days
of
his
own
courtship
the
more
did
his
own
deliverance
appear
to
him
to
be
almost
a
work
of
heaven
where
would
he
have
been
had
miss
thoroughbung
made
good
her
footing
in
buston
hall
he
used
to
shut
his
eyes
and
gently
raise
his
left
hand
toward
the
skies
as
he
told
himself
that
this
evil
thing
had
passed
by
him
but
it
had
passed
by
and
it
was
expected
that
there
should
be
a
lunch
of
some
sort
at
buston
and
as
with
all
his
diligent
inquiry
he
had
heard
nothing
but
good
of
florence
she
should
be
received
with
as
hearty
a
welcome
as
he
could
give
her
there
was
one
point
which
troubled
him
more
than
all
others
he
was
determined
to
refurnish
the
and
also
the
bedroom
in
which
florence
was
destined
to
sleep
he
told
his
sister
in
the
most
solemn
manner
that
he
had
at
last
made
up
his
mind
thoroughly
the
thing
should
be
done
she
understood
how
great
a
thing
it
was
for
him
to
do
the
two
centre
rooms
he
said
with
an
almost
tragic
air
then
he
sent
for
her
the
next
day
and
told
her
that
on
farther
considerations
he
had
determined
to
add
in
the
the
whole
parish
felt
the
effect
it
was
not
so
much
that
the
parish
was
struck
by
the
expenditure
proposed
because
the
squire
was
known
to
be
a
man
who
had
not
for
years
spent
all
his
income
but
that
he
had
given
way
so
far
on
behalf
of
a
nephew
whom
he
had
lately
been
so
anxious
to
disinherit
rumor
had
already
reached
buntingford
of
what
the
squire
had
intended
to
do
on
the
receipt
of
his
own
wife
rumors
which
had
of
course
since
faded
away
into
nothing
it
had
been
positively
notified
to
buntingford
that
there
should
be
really
a
new
carpet
and
new
curtains
in
the
miss
thoroughbung
had
been
known
to
have
declared
at
the
brewery
that
the
whole
thing
should
be
done
before
she
had
been
there
twelve
months
he
shall
go
the
whole
hog
she
had
said
and
there
had
been
a
little
bet
about
it
between
her
and
her
brother
who
entertained
an
idea
that
prosper
was
an
obstinate
man
and
joe
had
brought
tidings
of
the
bet
to
the
parsonage
so
that
there
had
been
much
commotion
on
the
subject
when
the
best
room
had
been
included
and
then
the
even
matthew
had
been
alarmed
it
come
to
as
much
as
five
hundred
pounds
he
had
whispered
to
annesley
matthew
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
quite
time
that
there
should
be
somebody
to
control
his
master
why
it
only
the
other
day
because
i
can
remember
it
myself
when
that
came
into
the
house
new
matthew
had
been
in
the
place
over
twenty
years
when
annesley
reminded
him
that
fashions
were
changed
and
that
other
kinds
of
table
were
required
he
only
shook
his
head
but
there
was
a
question
more
vital
than
that
of
expense
how
was
the
new
furniture
to
be
chosen
the
first
idea
was
that
florence
should
be
invited
to
spend
a
week
at
her
future
home
and
go
up
and
down
to
london
with
either
annesley
or
her
brother
and
select
the
furniture
herself
but
there
were
reasons
against
this
prosper
would
like
to
surprise
her
by
the
munificence
of
what
he
did
and
the
suggestion
of
one
day
was
sure
to
wane
before
the
stronger
lights
of
the
next
prosper
though
he
intended
to
be
munificent
was
still
a
little
afraid
that
it
should
be
thrown
away
as
a
thing
of
course
or
that
it
should
appear
to
have
been
harry
work
that
would
be
manifestly
unjust
i
think
i
had
better
do
it
myself
he
said
to
his
sister
perhaps
i
could
help
you
peter
he
shuddered
but
it
was
at
the
memory
of
the
sound
of
the
word
peter
as
it
had
been
blurted
out
for
his
express
annoyance
by
miss
thoroughbung
i
would
mind
going
up
to
london
with
you
he
shook
his
head
demanding
still
more
time
for
deliberation
were
he
to
accept
his
sister
offer
he
would
be
bound
by
his
acceptance
it
the
last
carpet
i
shall
ever
buy
he
said
to
himself
with
true
melancholy
as
he
walked
back
home
across
the
park
then
there
had
been
the
other
grand
question
of
the
journey
or
not
down
to
cheltenham
in
a
way
harry
had
told
him
that
the
wedding
would
be
no
wedding
without
his
presence
that
had
moved
him
considerably
it
was
very
desirable
that
the
wedding
should
be
more
than
a
merely
legal
wedding
the
world
ought
to
be
made
aware
that
the
heir
to
buston
had
been
married
in
the
presence
of
the
squire
of
buston
but
the
journey
was
a
tremendous
difficulty
if
he
could
have
gone
from
buston
direct
to
cheltenham
it
would
have
been
comparatively
easy
but
he
must
pass
through
london
and
to
do
this
must
travel
the
whole
way
between
the
northern
and
western
and
the
trains
would
not
fit
he
studied
his
bradshaw
for
an
entire
morning
and
found
that
they
would
not
fit
where
am
i
to
spend
the
hour
and
a
quarter
he
asked
his
sister
mournfully
and
there
would
be
four
journeys
going
and
coming
four
separate
journeys
and
these
would
be
irrespective
of
numerous
carriages
and
cabs
it
was
absolutely
impossible
that
he
should
be
present
in
the
flesh
on
that
happy
day
at
cheltenham
he
was
left
at
home
for
three
months
july
august
and
september
in
which
to
buy
the
furniture
which
however
was
at
last
procured
by
annesley
the
marriage
as
far
as
the
wedding
was
concerned
was
not
nearly
as
good
fun
as
that
of
joe
and
molly
there
was
no
crabtree
there
and
no
miss
thoroughbung
and
mountjoy
though
she
meant
to
do
it
all
as
well
as
it
could
be
done
was
still
joyous
only
with
bated
joy
some
tinge
of
melancholy
still
clung
to
her
she
had
for
so
many
years
thought
of
her
nephew
as
the
husband
destined
for
her
girl
that
she
could
not
be
as
yet
demonstrative
in
her
appreciation
of
harry
annesley
i
have
no
doubt
we
shall
come
to
be
true
friends
annesley
she
had
said
to
him
do
call
me
mr
annesley
no
i
wo
when
you
come
back
again
and
i
am
used
to
you
but
at
present
there
there
is
a
something
a
regret
perhaps
well
not
quite
a
regret
i
am
an
person
and
i
change
my
manners
all
at
once
you
know
what
it
was
that
i
used
to
hope
oh
yes
but
florence
was
very
stupid
and
would
have
a
different
opinion
of
course
i
am
happy
now
her
happiness
is
all
the
world
to
me
and
things
have
undergone
a
change
that
true
prosper
has
made
over
the
marrying
business
to
me
and
i
mean
to
go
through
it
like
a
man
only
you
must
call
me
harry
this
she
promised
to
do
and
did
in
the
seclusion
of
her
room
give
him
a
kiss
but
still
her
joy
was
not
loud
and
the
hilarity
of
her
guests
was
moderated
annesley
did
his
best
and
the
bridesmaids
dresses
were
pretty
which
is
all
that
is
required
of
a
bride
maid
then
at
last
the
father
carriage
came
and
they
were
carried
away
to
gloucester
where
they
were
committed
to
the
untender
commonplace
but
much
more
comfortable
mercies
of
the
there
we
will
part
with
them
and
encounter
them
again
but
for
a
few
moments
as
after
a
long
day
ramble
they
made
their
way
back
to
a
solitary
but
comfortable
hotel
among
the
bernese
alps
florence
was
on
a
pony
which
harry
had
insisted
on
hiring
for
her
though
florence
had
declared
herself
able
to
walk
the
whole
way
it
had
been
very
hot
and
she
was
probably
glad
of
the
pony
they
both
had
alpenstocks
in
their
hands
and
on
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
hung
the
light
jacket
with
which
he
had
started
and
which
had
not
been
so
light
but
that
he
had
been
glad
to
ease
himself
of
the
weight
the
guide
was
lagging
behind
and
they
two
were
close
together
well
old
girl
he
said
and
now
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
not
so
very
much
older
than
i
was
when
you
took
me
pet
oh
yes
you
are
half
of
your
life
has
gone
you
have
settled
down
into
the
cares
and
duties
of
married
life
none
of
which
had
been
so
much
as
thought
of
when
i
took
you
not
thought
of
they
have
been
on
my
mind
ever
since
that
night
at
mrs
armitage
only
in
a
romantic
and
therefore
untrue
sort
of
manner
since
that
time
you
have
always
thought
of
me
with
a
white
choker
and
do
flatter
yourself
i
never
looked
at
your
boots
you
knew
that
they
were
the
boots
and
the
clothes
of
a
man
making
love
did
you
i
do
care
personally
very
much
about
my
own
boots
i
never
shall
care
about
another
pair
but
i
should
care
about
them
anything
that
might
give
me
the
slightest
assistance
nothing
was
wanted
it
had
all
been
done
harry
my
pet
but
still
a
pair
of
heavy
with
nails
would
not
have
been
efficacious
then
i
should
think
i
love
him
you
might
have
said
to
yourself
but
he
is
such
an
awkward
fellow
it
had
gone
much
beyond
that
at
mrs
armitage
but
now
you
have
to
take
my
as
part
of
your
duty
and
you
when
a
man
loves
a
woman
he
falls
in
love
with
everything
belonging
to
her
you
do
wear
everything
you
possess
as
specially
your
own
has
to
administer
to
my
sense
of
love
and
beauty
i
wish
i
wish
it
might
be
so
there
is
no
danger
about
that
at
all
but
i
have
to
come
before
you
on
an
occasion
such
as
this
as
a
kind
of
navvy
and
you
must
accept
me
she
glanced
around
furtively
to
see
whether
their
guide
was
looking
but
the
guide
had
gone
back
out
of
sight
for
sitting
on
her
pony
she
had
her
arm
around
his
neck
and
kissed
him
and
then
there
is
ever
so
much
more
he
continued
i
do
think
i
snore
indeed
no
there
is
a
sound
comes
from
you
i
sometimes
look
to
see
if
i
think
you
are
alive
but
if
i
do
you
have
to
put
up
with
it
that
would
be
one
of
your
duties
as
a
wife
you
never
could
have
thought
of
that
when
i
had
those
on
of
course
i
did
how
can
you
talk
such
rubbish
i
do
know
whether
it
is
rubbish
those
are
the
kind
of
things
that
must
fall
upon
a
woman
so
heavily
suppose
i
were
to
beat
you
beat
me
yes
hit
you
over
the
head
with
this
stick
i
am
sure
you
would
not
do
that
so
am
i
but
suppose
i
were
to
your
mother
must
be
told
of
my
leaving
that
poor
man
bloody
and
speechless
what
if
i
were
to
carry
out
my
usual
habits
as
then
shown
take
care
my
darling
or
that
throw
you
this
he
said
as
the
pony
stumbled
over
a
stone
almost
as
unlikely
as
you
are
one
has
to
risk
dangers
in
the
world
but
one
makes
the
risk
as
little
as
possible
i
know
they
wo
give
me
a
pony
that
will
tumble
down
and
i
know
that
i
told
you
to
look
to
see
that
they
do
you
chose
the
pony
but
i
had
to
choose
you
i
do
know
very
much
about
ponies
but
i
do
know
something
about
a
lover
and
i
know
that
i
have
got
one
that
will
suit
me
