than

inches
from

in

days
on

seventh
day
nothing

whatsoever
occurred
the
impossibles
mark
phillips
to
john
without
whose
accident
in
this
series
would
not
have
been
possible
the
sidewalk
was
as
soft
as
a
good
bed
malone
lay
curled
on
it
thinking
about
nothing
at
all
he
was
drifting
off
into
a
wonderful
dream
and
he
did
want
to
interrupt
it
there
was
this
girl
a
beautiful
girl
more
wonderful
than
anything
he
had
ever
imagined
with
big
blue
eyes
and
long
blonde
hair
and
a
figure
that
made
the
average
girl
look
like
a
man
and
she
had
her
soft
white
hand
on
his
arm
and
she
was
looking
up
at
him
with
trust
and
devotion
and
even
adoration
in
her
eyes
and
her
voice
was
the
softest
possible
whisper
of
innocence
and
promise
i
love
to
go
up
to
your
apartment
with
you
malone
she
said
malone
smiled
back
at
her
gently
but
with
complete
confidence
call
me
ken
he
said
noticing
that
he
was
seven
feet
tall
and
superbly
muscled
he
put
his
free
hand
on
the
girl
warm
soft
shoulder
and
she
wriggled
with
delight
all
right
ken
she
said
you
know
i
never
met
anyone
like
you
before
i
mean
you
so
wonderful
and
everything
malone
chuckled
modestly
realizing
in
passing
how
full
and
rich
his
voice
had
become
he
felt
a
weight
pressing
over
his
heart
and
knew
that
it
was
his
wallet
stuffed
to
bursting
with
bills
but
was
this
a
time
to
think
of
money
no
malone
told
himself
this
was
the
time
for
adventure
for
romance
for
love
he
looked
down
at
the
girl
and
put
his
arm
around
her
waist
she
snuggled
closer
he
led
her
easily
down
the
long
wide
street
to
his
car
at
the
end
of
the
block
it
stood
in
godlike
solitude
a
beautiful
red
cadillac
capable
of
going
a
hundred
and
ten
miles
an
hour
in
any
gear
equipped
with
fully
automatic
steering
and
braking
and
with
a
stereophonic
radio
a
and
a
set
installed
in
both
front
and
back
seats
it
was
a
job
but
he
meant
to
trade
it
in
on
something
even
better
when
the
models
came
out
in
the
meantime
he
decided
it
would
do
he
handed
the
girl
in
went
round
to
the
other
side
and
slid
in
under
the
wheel
there
was
soft
music
playing
somewhere
and
a
magnificent
sunset
appeared
ahead
of
them
as
malone
pushed
a
button
on
the
dashboard
and
the
red
cadillac
started
off
down
the
wide
empty
wonderfully
paved
street
into
the
sunset
while
he
the
red
cadillac
the
sidewalk
became
a
little
harder
and
malone
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
lying
on
it
something
terrible
had
happened
he
knew
that
right
away
he
opened
his
eyes
to
look
for
the
girl
but
the
sunset
had
become
much
brighter
his
head
began
to
pound
with
the
slow
regularity
of
a
and
he
closed
his
eyes
again
in
a
hurry
the
sidewalk
swayed
a
little
but
he
managed
to
keep
his
balance
on
it
somehow
and
after
a
couple
of
minutes
it
was
quiet
again
his
head
hurt
maybe
that
was
the
terrible
thing
that
had
happened
but
malone
was
quite
sure
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
was
very
sure
about
anything
and
he
started
to
ask
himself
questions
to
make
certain
he
was
all
there
he
did
feel
all
there
he
felt
as
if
several
of
his
parts
had
been
replaced
with
or
even
experimental
models
and
something
had
happened
to
the
experiment
it
was
even
hard
to
think
of
any
questions
but
after
a
while
he
managed
to
come
up
with
a
few
is
your
name
kenneth
malone
do
you
live
washington
is
your
work
i
work
for
the
fbi
what
the
hell
are
you
doing
on
a
sidewalk
in
new
york
in
broad
daylight
he
tried
to
find
an
answer
to
that
but
there
did
seem
to
be
any
no
matter
where
he
looked
the
only
thing
he
could
think
of
was
the
red
cadillac
and
if
the
red
cadillac
had
anything
to
do
with
anything
malone
did
know
about
it
very
slowly
and
carefully
he
opened
his
eyes
again
one
at
a
time
he
discovered
that
the
light
was
not
coming
from
the
gorgeous
hollywood
sunset
he
had
dreamed
up
as
a
matter
of
fact
sunset
was
several
hours
in
the
past
and
it
never
looked
very
pretty
in
new
york
anyhow
it
was
the
middle
of
the
night
and
malone
was
lying
under
a
convenient
street
lamp
he
closed
his
eyes
again
and
waited
patiently
for
his
head
to
go
away
a
few
minutes
passed
it
was
obvious
that
his
head
had
settled
down
for
a
long
stay
and
no
matter
how
bad
it
felt
malone
told
himself
it
his
head
after
all
he
felt
a
certain
responsibility
for
it
and
he
could
just
leave
it
lying
around
somewhere
with
its
eyes
closed
he
opened
the
head
eyes
once
more
and
this
time
he
kept
them
open
for
a
long
time
he
stared
at
the
post
of
the
street
lamp
considering
it
and
he
finally
decided
that
it
looked
sturdy
enough
to
support
a
hundred
and
pounds
of
fbi
man
even
with
the
head
added
in
he
grabbed
for
the
post
with
both
hands
and
started
to
pull
himself
upright
noticing
vaguely
that
his
legs
had
somehow
managed
to
get
underneath
him
as
soon
as
he
was
standing
he
wished
he
stayed
on
the
nice
horizontal
sidewalk
his
head
was
spinning
dizzily
and
his
mind
was
being
sucked
down
into
the
whirlpool
he
held
on
to
the
post
grimly
and
tried
to
stay
conscious
a
long
time
possibly
two
or
three
seconds
passed
malone
moved
at
all
when
the
two
cops
came
along
one
of
them
was
a
big
man
with
a
brassy
voice
and
a
face
that
looked
as
if
it
had
been
overbaked
in
a
waffle
iron
he
came
up
behind
malone
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
but
malone
barely
felt
the
touch
then
the
cop
bellowed
into
malone
ear
what
the
matter
buddy
malone
appreciated
the
man
sympathy
it
was
good
to
know
that
you
had
friends
but
he
wished
remotely
that
the
cop
and
his
friend
a
shorter
and
thinner
version
of
the
beat
patrolman
would
go
away
and
leave
him
in
peace
maybe
he
could
lie
down
on
the
sidewalk
again
and
get
a
couple
of
hundred
years
rest
who
could
tell
mallri
he
said
you
all
right
the
big
cop
said
that
fine
that
great
so
why
do
you
go
home
and
sleep
it
off
sleep
malone
said
home
wherever
you
live
buddy
the
big
cop
said
come
on
ca
stand
around
on
the
sidewalk
all
night
malone
shook
his
head
and
decided
at
once
never
to
do
it
again
he
had
some
kind
of
rare
disease
he
realized
his
brain
was
loose
and
the
inside
of
his
skull
was
covered
with
sandpaper
every
time
his
head
moved
the
brain
jounced
against
some
of
the
sandpaper
but
the
policemen
thought
he
was
drunk
that
was
right
he
let
the
police
get
the
wrong
impression
of
fbi
agents
now
the
men
would
go
around
telling
people
that
the
fbi
was
always
drunk
and
disorderly
not
drunk
he
said
clearly
sure
the
big
cop
said
you
fine
maybe
just
one
too
many
huh
no
malone
said
the
effort
exhausted
him
and
he
had
to
catch
his
breath
before
he
could
say
anything
else
but
the
cops
waited
patiently
at
last
he
said
somebody
slugged
me
slugged
the
big
cop
said
right
malone
remembered
just
in
time
not
to
nod
his
head
how
about
a
description
buddy
the
big
cop
said
did
see
him
malone
said
he
let
go
of
the
post
with
one
hand
keeping
a
precarious
grip
with
the
other
he
stared
at
his
watch
the
hands
danced
back
and
forth
but
he
focused
on
them
after
a
while
it
was
happened
just
a
few
minutes
ago
he
said
maybe
you
can
catch
him
the
big
cop
said
nobody
around
here
the
place
is
deserted
except
for
you
buddy
he
paused
and
then
added
let
see
some
identification
huh
or
did
he
take
your
wallet
malone
thought
about
getting
the
wallet
and
decided
against
it
the
motions
required
would
be
a
little
tricky
and
he
was
sure
he
could
manage
them
without
letting
go
of
the
post
entirely
at
last
he
decided
to
let
the
cop
get
his
wallet
inside
coat
pocket
he
said
the
other
policeman
blinked
and
looked
up
his
face
was
a
studied
blank
hey
buddy
he
said
you
know
you
got
blood
on
your
head
be
damned
the
big
cop
said
sam
right
you
bleeding
mister
good
malone
said
the
big
cop
said
huh
i
thought
maybe
my
skull
was
going
to
explode
from
high
blood
pressure
malone
said
it
was
beginning
to
be
a
little
easier
to
talk
but
as
long
as
there
a
slow
leak
i
guess
i
out
of
danger
get
his
wallet
sam
said
i
watch
him
a
hand
went
into
malone
jacket
pocket
it
tickled
a
little
bit
but
malone
did
think
of
objecting
naturally
enough
the
hand
and
malone
wallet
did
not
make
an
instantaneous
connection
when
the
hand
touched
the
bulky
object
strapped
near
malone
armpit
it
stopped
frozen
and
then
cautiously
snaked
the
object
out
what
that
bill
sam
said
bill
looked
up
with
the
object
in
his
hand
he
seemed
a
little
dazed
it
a
gun
he
said
my
god
sam
said
the
guy
heeled
watch
him
do
let
him
get
away
malone
considered
getting
away
and
decided
that
he
could
move
it
okay
he
said
okay
hell
sam
said
it
a
magnum
what
are
you
doing
with
a
gun
mac
he
was
no
longer
polite
and
friendly
why
are
you
carrying
a
gun
he
said
i
not
carrying
it
malone
said
tiredly
bill
is
your
pal
bill
backed
away
from
malone
putting
the
magnum
in
his
pocket
and
keeping
the
fbi
agent
covered
with
his
own
police
positive
at
the
same
time
he
fished
out
the
personal
radio
every
patrolman
carried
in
his
uniform
and
began
calling
for
a
prowl
car
in
a
low
somewhat
nervous
voice
sam
said
my
god
a
gun
he
could
of
shot
everybody
get
his
wallet
bill
said
he
ca
hurt
you
now
i
disarmed
him
malone
began
to
feel
slightly
dangerous
maybe
he
a
famous
gangster
he
was
sure
maybe
all
this
about
being
an
fbi
agent
was
just
a
figment
of
his
imagination
blows
on
the
head
did
funny
things
i
drill
everybody
full
of
holes
he
said
in
a
harsh
underworld
sort
of
voice
but
it
did
sound
very
convincing
sam
approached
him
gently
and
fished
out
his
wallet
with
great
care
as
if
malone
were
a
ticking
bomb
ready
to
go
off
any
second
there
was
a
little
silence
then
sam
said
give
him
his
gun
back
bill
in
a
hushed
and
respectful
tone
give
him
back
his
gun
the
big
cop
said
you
gone
nuts
sam
sam
shook
his
head
slowly
nope
he
said
but
we
made
a
terrible
mistake
know
who
this
guy
is
he
heeled
bill
said
that
all
i
want
to
know
he
put
the
radio
away
and
gave
all
his
attention
to
malone
he
fbi
sam
said
the
wallet
says
so
badge
and
everything
and
not
only
that
bill
he
kenneth
j
malone
well
malone
thought
with
relief
that
settled
that
he
was
a
gangster
after
all
he
was
just
the
fbi
agent
he
had
always
known
and
loved
maybe
now
the
cops
would
about
his
head
and
take
him
away
for
burial
malone
bill
said
you
mean
the
guy
who
here
about
all
those
red
cadillacs
sure
sam
said
so
give
him
his
gun
back
he
looked
at
malone
listen
malone
he
said
we
sorry
we
sorry
as
hell
that
all
right
malone
said
absently
he
moved
his
head
slowly
and
looked
around
his
suspicions
were
confirmed
there
was
a
red
cadillac
anywhere
in
sight
and
from
the
looks
of
the
street
there
never
had
been
it
gone
he
said
but
the
cops
were
listening
we
better
get
you
to
a
hospital
bill
said
as
soon
as
the
prowl
car
gets
here
we
take
you
right
on
down
to
vincent
can
you
tell
us
what
happened
or
is
it
classified
malone
wondered
what
could
be
classified
about
a
blow
on
the
head
and
decided
not
to
think
about
it
i
can
tell
you
he
said
if
answer
one
question
for
me
sure
malone
bill
said
we
be
glad
to
help
anything
at
all
sam
said
malone
gave
them
what
he
hoped
was
a
gracious
and
condescending
smile
all
right
then
he
said
where
the
hell
am
i
in
new
york
sam
said
i
know
that
malone
said
tiredly
anywhere
in
particular
or
just
sort
of
all
over
new
york
ninth
street
bill
said
hurriedly
near
the
village
is
that
where
you
were
when
they
slugged
you
i
guess
so
malone
said
sure
he
nodded
and
immediately
remembered
that
he
should
have
he
closed
his
eyes
until
the
pain
had
softened
to
agony
and
then
opened
them
again
i
was
getting
pretty
tired
of
sitting
around
waiting
for
something
to
break
on
this
case
he
said
and
i
could
sleep
so
i
went
out
for
a
walk
i
ended
up
in
greenwich
village
which
is
a
hell
of
a
place
for
a
man
to
end
up
i
know
just
what
you
mean
sam
said
sympathetically
bohemians
they
call
themselves
crazy
people
not
the
people
malone
said
the
streets
i
got
sort
of
lost
chicago
he
reflected
was
a
long
way
from
the
easiest
city
in
the
world
to
get
around
in
and
he
supposed
you
could
even
get
confused
in
washington
if
you
tried
hard
enough
but
he
knew
those
cities
he
could
find
his
way
around
in
them
greenwich
village
was
different
it
was
harder
to
navigate
in
than
the
trackless
forests
of
the
amazon
the
village
had
tracks
all
right
thousands
of
tracks
only
none
of
them
led
anywhere
in
particular
anyhow
malone
said
i
saw
this
red
cadillac
the
cops
looked
around
hurriedly
and
then
looked
back
at
malone
bill
started
to
say
but
there
is
any
i
know
malone
said
it
gone
now
that
the
trouble
you
mean
somebody
got
in
and
drove
it
away
sam
said
for
all
i
know
malone
said
it
sprouted
wings
and
flew
away
he
paused
when
i
saw
it
though
when
i
saw
it
i
decided
to
go
over
and
have
a
look
just
in
case
sure
bill
said
makes
sense
he
stared
at
his
partner
as
if
defying
him
to
prove
it
did
make
sense
malone
did
really
care
there
was
anybody
else
on
the
street
he
said
so
i
walked
over
and
tried
the
door
that
all
i
did
even
open
the
car
or
anything
and
i
swear
there
was
nobody
behind
me
well
sam
said
the
street
was
empty
when
we
got
here
but
a
guy
could
have
driven
off
in
that
red
cadillac
before
we
got
here
bill
said
sure
malone
said
but
where
did
he
come
from
i
figured
maybe
somebody
dropped
something
by
mistake
a
safe
or
something
because
there
was
anybody
behind
me
there
had
to
be
bill
said
well
malone
said
there
was
there
was
a
little
silence
what
happened
then
sam
said
after
you
tried
the
door
handle
i
mean
then
malone
said
then
i
went
out
like
a
light
a
pair
of
headlights
rounded
the
nearby
corner
bill
looked
up
that
the
prowl
car
he
announced
and
went
over
to
meet
it
the
driver
was
a
solidly
built
little
man
with
the
face
of
a
pekingese
his
partner
a
tall
man
who
looked
as
if
he
have
been
much
more
comfortable
in
a
stetson
instead
of
the
regulation
blue
cap
leaned
out
at
bill
sam
and
malone
what
the
trouble
here
he
said
in
a
harsh
high
voice
no
trouble
bill
said
and
went
over
to
the
car
he
began
talking
to
the
two
cops
inside
in
a
low
urgent
voice
meanwhile
sam
got
his
arm
around
malone
and
began
pulling
him
away
from
the
lamp
post
malone
was
a
little
unwilling
to
let
go
at
first
but
sam
was
stronger
than
he
looked
he
convoyed
the
fbi
agent
carefully
to
the
rear
door
of
the
prowl
car
opened
it
and
levered
malone
gently
to
a
seat
inside
just
as
bill
said
so
with
the
cut
and
all
we
figured
he
ought
to
go
over
to
vincent
you
people
were
already
on
the
way
so
we
did
bother
with
ambulances
the
driver
snorted
next
time
you
want
taxi
service
he
said
you
just
call
us
up
what
do
you
think
a
prowl
car
an
easy
life
easier
than
doing
a
beat
bill
said
mournfully
and
anyway
he
added
in
a
low
penetrating
whisper
the
guy
fbi
so
the
fbi
got
all
kinds
of
equipment
the
driver
said
the
latest
why
do
he
whistle
up
a
helicopter
or
a
jet
then
apparently
deciding
that
further
invective
would
get
him
nowhere
he
settled
back
in
his
seat
said
aah
forget
it
and
started
the
car
with
a
small
but
perceptible
jerk
malone
decided
not
to
get
into
the
argument
he
was
tired
and
it
was
late
he
rested
his
head
on
the
back
seat
and
tried
to
relax
but
all
he
could
do
was
think
about
red
cadillacs
he
wished
he
had
never
even
heard
of
red
cadillacs
and
it
had
all
started
so
simply
too
malone
remembered
very
clearly
the
first
time
he
had
had
any
indication
that
red
cadillacs
were
anything
unusual
or
special
before
that
he
viewed
them
all
with
slightly
wistful
eyes
red
blue
green
gray
white
or
even
black
cadillacs
were
all
the
same
to
him
they
spelled
luxury
and
wealth
and
display
and
a
lot
of
other
nice
things
now
he
was
at
all
sure
what
they
spelled
except
that
it
was
definitely
uncomfortable
and
highly
baffling
he
walked
into
the
offices
of
andrew
burris
director
of
the
fbi
just
one
week
ago
it
was
a
beautiful
office
and
spacious
and
it
boasted
an
enormous
polished
desk
and
behind
the
desk
sat
burris
himself
looking
both
tired
and
somehow
a
little
kindly
you
sent
for
me
chief
malone
said
that
right
burris
nodded
malone
you
been
working
too
hard
lately
now
malone
thought
it
was
coming
the
dismissal
he
always
feared
at
last
burris
had
found
out
that
he
was
the
bright
intelligent
fearless
and
alert
fbi
agent
he
was
supposed
to
be
burris
had
discovered
that
he
was
nothing
more
or
less
than
lucky
and
that
all
the
fine
jobs
he
was
supposed
to
have
done
were
only
the
result
of
luck
oh
well
malone
thought
not
being
an
fbi
agent
would
be
so
bad
he
could
always
find
another
job
only
at
the
moment
he
could
think
of
one
he
liked
he
decided
to
make
one
last
plea
i
have
been
working
so
hard
chief
he
said
not
too
hard
anyhow
i
in
great
shape
i
i
taken
advantage
of
you
malone
that
what
i
done
burris
said
just
as
if
malone
had
spoken
at
all
just
because
you
the
best
agent
i
got
that
no
reason
for
me
to
hand
you
all
the
tough
ones
just
because
i
what
malone
said
feeling
slightly
faint
i
given
you
the
tough
ones
because
you
could
handle
them
burris
said
but
that
no
reason
to
keep
loading
jobs
on
you
after
that
job
you
did
on
the
gorelik
kidnaping
and
the
way
you
wrapped
up
the
transom
counterfeit
ring
well
malone
i
think
you
need
a
little
relaxation
relaxation
malone
said
feeling
just
a
little
bit
pleased
of
course
he
did
deserve
any
of
the
praise
he
was
getting
he
knew
he
just
happened
to
walk
in
on
the
gorelik
kidnapers
because
his
telephone
had
been
out
of
order
and
the
transom
ring
had
been
just
his
job
after
all
if
other
agents
had
managed
to
trace
the
counterfeit
bills
back
to
a
common
area
in
cincinnati
he
never
have
been
able
to
complete
his
part
of
the
assignment
but
it
was
nice
to
be
praised
anyhow
malone
felt
a
twinge
of
guilt
and
told
himself
sternly
to
relax
and
enjoy
himself
that
what
i
said
burris
told
him
relaxation
well
malone
said
i
certainly
would
like
a
vacation
that
for
sure
i
like
to
snooze
for
a
couple
of
weeks
or
maybe
go
up
to
cape
cod
for
a
while
there
a
lot
of
nice
scenery
up
around
there
restful
sort
of
and
i
could
just
he
stopped
burris
was
frowning
and
when
andrew
burris
frowned
it
was
a
good
idea
to
look
attentive
interested
and
alert
now
malone
burris
said
sadly
i
was
exactly
thinking
about
a
vacation
you
not
scheduled
for
one
until
august
you
know
oh
i
know
chief
malone
said
but
i
thought
much
as
i
like
to
burris
said
i
just
ca
make
an
exception
you
know
that
malone
i
got
to
go
pretty
much
by
the
schedule
yes
sir
malone
said
feeling
just
a
shade
disappointed
but
i
do
think
you
deserve
a
rest
burris
said
well
if
i
here
what
i
going
to
do
burris
said
and
paused
malone
felt
a
little
unsure
as
to
exactly
what
his
chief
was
talking
about
but
by
now
he
knew
better
than
to
ask
a
lot
of
questions
sooner
or
later
burris
would
probably
explain
himself
and
if
he
did
then
there
was
no
use
worrying
about
it
that
was
just
the
way
burris
acted
suppose
i
gave
you
a
chance
to
take
it
easy
for
a
while
burris
said
you
could
catch
up
on
your
sleep
see
some
shows
have
a
couple
of
drinks
during
the
evening
take
girls
out
for
dinner
you
know
something
like
that
how
would
you
like
it
well
malone
said
cautiously
good
burris
said
i
knew
you
would
malone
opened
his
mouth
thought
briefly
and
closed
it
again
after
all
it
did
sound
sort
of
promising
and
if
there
was
a
catch
in
it
he
find
out
about
it
soon
enough
it
really
just
a
routine
case
burris
said
in
an
offhand
tone
nothing
to
it
oh
malone
said
there
this
red
cadillac
burris
said
it
was
stolen
from
a
party
in
connecticut
out
near
danbury
and
it
showed
up
in
new
york
city
now
the
car
crossed
a
state
line
that
puts
it
in
our
jurisdiction
malone
said
feeling
obvious
right
burris
said
right
on
the
nose
but
the
new
york
office
naturally
they
in
charge
of
everything
burris
said
but
sending
you
out
as
sort
of
a
special
observer
just
keep
your
eyes
open
and
nose
around
and
let
me
know
what
happening
keep
my
eyes
and
nose
what
malone
said
open
burris
said
and
let
me
know
about
it
malone
tried
to
picture
himself
with
his
eyes
and
nose
open
and
decided
he
did
look
very
attractive
that
way
well
it
was
only
a
figure
of
speech
or
something
he
did
have
to
think
about
it
it
really
made
a
very
ugly
picture
but
why
a
special
observer
he
said
after
a
second
burris
could
read
the
reports
from
the
new
york
office
and
probably
get
more
facts
than
any
single
agent
could
find
out
just
wandering
around
a
strange
city
it
sounded
as
if
there
were
something
malone
told
himself
just
a
tiny
shade
rotten
in
denmark
it
sounded
as
if
there
were
going
to
be
something
in
the
nice
easy
assignment
he
was
getting
that
would
make
him
wish
he
gone
lion
hunting
in
darkest
africa
instead
and
then
again
maybe
he
was
wrong
he
stood
at
ease
and
waited
to
find
out
well
burris
said
it
is
just
a
routine
case
just
like
i
said
but
there
seems
to
be
something
a
little
bit
odd
about
it
i
see
malone
said
with
a
sinking
feeling
here
what
happened
burris
said
hurriedly
as
if
he
were
afraid
malone
was
going
to
change
his
mind
and
refuse
the
assignment
this
red
cadillac
i
told
you
about
was
reported
stolen
from
danbury
three
days
later
it
turned
up
in
new
york
city
parked
smack
across
the
street
from
a
precinct
police
station
of
course
it
took
them
a
while
to
wake
up
but
one
of
the
officers
happened
to
notice
the
routine
report
on
stolen
cars
in
the
area
and
he
decided
to
go
across
the
street
and
check
the
license
number
on
the
car
then
something
funny
happened
something
funny
malone
asked
he
doubted
that
whatever
it
was
it
was
going
to
make
him
laugh
but
he
kept
his
face
a
careful
receptive
blank
that
right
burris
said
now
if
you
going
to
understand
what
happened
you
got
to
get
the
whole
picture
sure
malone
said
only
that
is
what
i
mean
burris
added
suddenly
malone
blinked
is
what
you
mean
he
said
understanding
what
happened
burris
said
that
the
trouble
you
wo
understand
what
happened
i
do
understand
it
and
neither
does
anybody
else
so
what
do
you
think
about
it
think
about
what
malone
said
about
what
i
been
telling
you
burris
snapped
this
car
malone
took
a
deep
breath
well
he
said
this
officer
went
over
to
check
the
license
plate
it
seems
like
the
right
thing
to
do
just
what
i
have
done
myself
sure
you
would
burris
said
anybody
would
but
listen
to
me
all
right
chief
malone
said
it
was
just
after
dawn
early
in
the
morning
malone
wondered
briefly
if
there
were
parts
of
the
world
where
dawn
came
say
late
in
the
afternoon
or
during
the
evening
sometime
but
he
said
nothing
the
street
was
deserted
burris
went
on
but
it
was
pretty
light
out
and
the
witnesses
are
willing
to
swear
that
there
was
nobody
on
that
street
for
a
block
in
either
direction
except
them
of
course
except
who
malone
said
except
the
witnesses
burris
said
patiently
four
cops
police
officers
who
were
standing
on
the
front
steps
of
the
precinct
station
talking
they
were
waiting
to
go
on
duty
or
anyhow
that
what
the
report
said
it
lucky
they
were
there
for
whatever
reason
the
only
witnesses
we
got
burris
stopped
malone
waited
a
few
seconds
and
then
said
as
calmly
as
he
could
witnesses
to
what
to
this
whole
business
with
sergeant
jukovsky
burris
said
the
sudden
introduction
of
a
completely
new
name
confused
malone
for
an
instant
but
he
recovered
gamely
sergeant
jukovsky
was
the
man
who
investigated
the
car
he
said
that
right
burris
said
except
that
he
did
malone
sighed
those
four
officers
the
witnesses
they
were
paying
much
attention
to
what
looked
like
the
routine
investigation
of
a
parked
car
burris
said
but
here
their
testimony
they
were
standing
around
talking
when
this
sergeant
jukovsky
came
out
of
the
station
spoke
to
them
in
passing
and
went
on
across
the
street
he
seem
very
worried
or
alarmed
about
anything
good
malone
said
involuntarily
i
mean
go
on
chief
he
added
ah
burris
said
all
right
well
according
to
jukovsky
he
took
a
look
at
the
plate
and
found
the
numbers
checked
the
listing
he
had
for
a
stolen
connecticut
car
then
he
walked
around
to
take
a
look
inside
the
car
it
was
empty
get
that
malone
the
car
was
empty
well
malone
said
it
was
parked
i
suppose
parked
cars
are
usually
empty
what
special
about
this
one
wait
and
see
burris
said
ominously
jukovsky
swears
the
car
was
empty
he
tried
the
doors
and
they
were
all
locked
but
one
the
front
door
on
the
curb
side
the
driver
door
so
he
opened
it
and
leaned
over
to
have
a
look
at
the
odometer
to
check
the
mileage
and
something
clobbered
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
one
of
the
other
cops
malone
said
one
of
the
who
burris
said
no
not
the
cops
not
at
all
then
something
fell
on
him
malone
said
okay
then
whatever
fell
on
him
ought
to
be
malone
burris
said
yes
chief
jukovsky
woke
up
on
the
sidewalk
with
the
other
cops
all
around
him
there
was
nothing
on
that
sidewalk
but
jukovsky
nothing
could
have
fallen
on
him
it
had
landed
anywhere
if
you
see
what
i
mean
sure
malone
said
but
whatever
it
was
burris
said
they
did
find
it
but
that
the
peculiar
thing
no
no
burris
said
slowly
now
wait
a
minute
malone
said
they
looked
on
the
sidewalk
and
around
there
but
did
they
think
to
search
the
car
they
did
get
a
chance
burris
said
anyhow
not
then
not
until
they
got
around
to
picking
up
the
pieces
of
the
car
uptown
at
street
malone
closed
his
eyes
where
was
this
precinct
he
said
midtown
burris
said
in
the
forties
and
the
pieces
of
the
car
were
eighty
blocks
away
when
they
searched
it
malone
said
burris
nodded
all
right
malone
said
pleasantly
i
give
up
well
that
what
i
trying
to
tell
you
burris
said
according
to
the
witnesses
after
jukovsky
fell
out
of
the
car
the
motor
started
and
the
car
drove
off
uptown
oh
malone
said
he
thought
about
that
for
a
minute
and
decided
at
last
to
hazard
one
little
question
it
sounded
silly
but
then
what
did
the
car
just
drove
off
all
by
itself
he
said
burris
seemed
abashed
well
malone
he
said
carefully
where
the
conflicting
stories
of
the
eyewitnesses
do
agree
you
see
two
of
the
cops
say
there
was
nobody
in
the
car
nobody
at
all
of
any
kind
small
or
large
and
the
other
two
malone
said
the
other
two
swear
they
saw
somebody
at
the
wheel
burris
said
but
they
wo
say
whether
it
was
a
man
a
woman
a
small
child
or
an
anthropoid
ape
and
they
have
the
faintest
idea
where
he
she
or
it
came
from
great
malone
said
he
felt
a
little
tired
this
trip
was
beginning
to
sound
less
and
less
like
a
vacation
those
two
cops
swear
there
was
something
or
somebody
driving
the
car
burris
said
and
that
is
all
it
is
malone
said
burris
shook
his
head
a
couple
of
the
cops
jumped
into
a
squad
car
and
started
following
the
red
cadillac
one
of
these
cops
saw
somebody
in
the
car
when
it
left
the
curb
the
other
one
did
got
that
i
got
it
malone
said
but
i
do
exactly
know
what
to
do
with
it
just
hold
on
to
it
burris
said
and
listen
to
this
the
cops
were
about
two
blocks
behind
at
the
start
and
they
could
close
the
gap
right
away
the
cadillac
headed
west
and
climbed
up
the
ramp
of
the
west
side
highway
heading
north
out
toward
westchester
i
give
a
lot
to
know
where
they
were
going
too
but
they
crashed
malone
said
remembering
that
the
pieces
were
at
street
so
they
did
crash
right
away
burris
said
the
prowl
car
started
gaining
on
the
cadillac
slowly
and
now
get
this
malone
both
the
cops
swear
there
somebody
in
the
driver
seat
now
wait
a
minute
malone
said
one
of
these
cops
did
see
anybody
at
all
in
the
driver
seat
when
the
car
started
off
right
burris
said
but
on
the
west
side
highway
he
did
see
a
driver
malone
said
he
thought
for
a
minute
hell
it
could
happen
they
took
off
so
fast
he
could
have
been
confused
or
something
there
another
explanation
burris
said
sure
malone
said
cheerfully
we
all
crazy
the
whole
world
is
crazy
not
that
one
burris
said
i
tell
you
when
i
finish
with
this
thing
about
the
car
itself
there
is
much
description
of
whoever
or
whatever
was
driving
that
car
on
the
west
side
highway
by
the
way
in
case
you
were
thinking
of
asking
malone
who
had
been
thinking
of
asking
anything
tried
to
look
clever
burris
regarded
him
owlishly
for
a
second
and
then
went
on
the
car
was
hitting
it
up
at
about
a
hundred
and
ten
by
this
time
and
accelerating
all
the
time
but
the
squad
car
was
coming
on
fast
too
and
it
was
quite
a
chase
luckily
there
were
many
cars
on
the
road
somebody
could
have
been
killed
malone
like
the
driver
of
the
cadillac
malone
ventured
burris
looked
pained
not
exactly
he
said
because
the
car
hit
the
street
exit
like
a
bomb
it
swerved
right
just
as
though
it
were
going
to
take
the
exit
and
head
off
somewhere
but
it
was
going
much
too
fast
by
that
time
there
just
was
any
way
to
maneuver
the
cadillac
hit
the
embankment
flipped
over
the
edge
and
smashed
it
caught
fire
almost
at
once
of
course
the
prowl
car
braked
fast
and
went
down
the
exit
after
it
but
there
was
anything
to
do
that
what
i
said
malone
said
the
driver
of
the
cadillac
was
killed
in
a
fire
like
that
do
jump
to
conclusions
malone
burris
said
wait
when
the
prowl
car
boys
got
to
the
scene
there
was
no
sign
of
anybody
in
the
car
nobody
at
all
in
the
heat
of
those
flames
malone
began
not
enough
heat
and
not
enough
time
burris
said
a
human
body
could
have
been
destroyed
in
just
a
few
minutes
not
that
completely
some
of
the
car
metal
was
melted
sure
but
there
would
have
been
traces
of
anybody
who
been
in
the
car
nice
big
easily
seen
traces
and
there
were
any
no
corpse
no
remains
no
nothing
malone
let
that
stew
in
his
mind
for
a
few
seconds
but
the
cops
said
whatever
the
cops
said
burris
snapped
there
was
nobody
at
all
in
that
cadillac
when
it
went
off
the
embankment
now
wait
a
minute
malone
said
here
a
car
with
a
driver
who
appears
and
disappears
practically
at
will
sometimes
he
there
and
sometimes
he
not
there
ah
burris
said
that
why
i
have
another
explanation
malone
shifted
his
feet
maybe
there
another
explanation
but
he
told
himself
it
would
have
to
be
a
good
one
nobody
expects
a
car
to
drive
itself
down
a
highway
burris
said
that
right
malone
said
that
why
it
all
impossible
so
burris
said
it
would
be
a
natural
hallucination
or
illusion
anyhow
for
somebody
to
imagine
he
did
see
a
driver
when
there
any
okay
malone
said
there
was
any
driver
so
the
car
have
gone
anywhere
so
the
new
york
police
force
is
lying
to
us
a
good
explanation
but
it
they
are
lying
burris
said
why
should
they
i
thinking
of
something
else
he
stopped
his
eyes
bright
as
he
leaned
across
the
desk
toward
malone
do
i
get
three
guesses
malone
said
burris
ignored
him
frankly
he
said
i
got
a
hunch
that
the
whole
thing
was
done
with
remote
control
somewhere
in
that
car
was
a
very
cleverly
concealed
device
that
was
capable
of
running
the
cadillac
from
a
distance
it
did
sound
plausible
malone
thought
did
the
prowl
car
boys
find
any
traces
of
it
when
they
examined
the
wreckage
he
said
not
a
thing
burris
said
but
after
all
it
could
have
been
melted
the
fire
did
destroy
a
lot
of
the
cadillac
and
there
just
no
telling
but
i
give
long
odds
that
there
must
have
been
some
kind
of
robot
device
in
that
car
it
the
only
answer
is
it
i
suppose
so
malone
said
malone
burns
said
his
voice
filled
with
devotion
to
one
country
in
the
face
of
great
obstacles
malone
i
want
you
to
find
that
device
in
the
wreck
malone
said
burris
sighed
and
leaned
back
no
he
said
of
course
not
not
in
the
wreck
but
the
other
red
cadillacs
some
of
them
anyhow
ought
to
have
what
red
cadillacs
malone
said
the
other
ones
that
have
been
stolen
from
connecticut
mostly
one
from
new
jersey
out
near
passaic
have
any
of
the
others
been
moving
around
without
drivers
malone
said
well
burris
said
there
been
no
report
of
it
but
who
can
tell
he
gestured
with
both
arms
anything
is
possible
malone
sure
malone
said
now
burris
said
all
of
the
stolen
cars
are
red
cadillacs
there
got
to
be
some
reason
for
that
i
think
they
covering
up
another
car
like
the
one
that
got
smashed
a
cadillac
or
even
a
automatic
cadillac
they
malone
said
who
whoever
is
stealing
the
cars
burris
said
patiently
oh
malone
said
sure
but
so
get
up
to
new
york
burris
said
keep
your
eyes
open
and
nose
around
got
it
i
have
now
malone
said
and
when
that
cadillac
is
found
malone
we
want
to
take
a
look
at
it
okay
yes
sir
malone
said
of
course
there
were
written
reports
too
burris
had
handed
malone
a
sheaf
of
them
copies
of
the
new
york
police
reports
to
burris
himself
and
malone
wanting
some
time
to
look
through
them
had
taken
a
train
to
new
york
instead
of
a
plane
besides
the
new
planes
still
made
him
slightly
nervous
though
he
could
ride
one
when
he
had
to
if
jet
engines
had
been
good
enough
for
the
last
generation
he
thought
they
were
certainly
good
enough
for
him
but
avoidance
of
the
new
planes
was
all
the
good
the
train
trip
did
him
the
reports
contained
thousands
of
words
none
of
which
was
either
new
or
apparently
significant
to
malone
burris
he
considered
had
given
him
everything
necessary
for
the
job
except
of
course
a
way
to
make
sense
out
of
the
whole
thing
he
considered
cadillacs
what
good
were
they
they
might
make
it
easier
for
the
average
driver
of
course
but
that
was
no
reason
to
cover
up
for
them
hitting
policemen
over
the
head
and
smashing
cars
and
driving
a
hundred
and
ten
miles
an
hour
on
the
west
side
highway
all
the
same
it
was
the
only
explanation
malone
had
and
he
cherished
it
deeply
he
put
the
papers
back
in
his
brief
case
when
the
train
pulled
into
penn
station
handed
his
suitcases
to
a
redcap
and
punched
the
buttons
for
the
waiting
room
now
he
thought
as
he
strolled
slowly
along
behind
the
robot
there
was
an
invention
that
made
sense
and
nobody
had
to
get
killed
for
it
or
hit
over
the
head
or
smashed
up
had
they
so
what
was
all
this
nonsense
about
red
cadillacs
driving
these
unwelcome
reflections
from
his
mind
he
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
he
had
barely
taken
the
first
puff
when
a
familiar
voice
said
hey
buddy
hold
the
light
will
you
malone
looked
up
blinked
and
grinned
happily
boyd
he
said
what
are
you
doing
here
i
have
seen
you
since
sure
have
boyd
said
i
been
out
west
on
a
couple
of
cases
must
be
a
year
since
we
worked
together
just
about
malone
said
but
what
are
you
doing
in
new
york
vacationing
not
exactly
boyd
said
the
chief
called
it
sort
of
a
vacation
but
oh
malone
said
you
re
working
with
me
boyd
nodded
the
chief
sent
me
up
when
i
got
back
from
the
west
he
suddenly
decided
you
might
need
a
good
assistant
so
i
took
the
plane
down
and
got
here
ahead
of
you
great
malone
said
but
i
want
to
warn
you
about
the
vacation
never
mind
boyd
said
just
a
shade
sadly
i
know
it
is
he
seemed
deep
in
thought
as
if
he
were
deciding
whether
or
not
to
get
rid
of
anne
boleyn
it
was
malone
thought
an
unusually
apt
simile
boyd
six
feet
tall
and
weighing
about
two
hundred
and
pounds
had
a
large
square
face
and
a
figure
that
might
have
made
him
a
dead
ringer
for
henry
viii
of
england
even
without
his
fringe
of
beard
and
his
mustache
with
them
thanks
to
the
recent
fbi
rule
that
agents
could
wear
facial
hair
at
the
discretion
of
the
director
or
such
board
as
he
may
appoint
the
resemblance
to
the
tudor
monarch
was
uncanny
but
like
his
famous
double
boyd
did
stay
sad
for
long
i
thought
i
meet
you
at
the
station
he
said
cheering
up
and
maybe
talk
over
old
times
for
a
while
on
the
way
to
the
hotel
anyhow
so
long
as
there
was
anything
else
to
do
sure
malone
said
it
good
to
see
you
again
and
when
did
you
get
pulled
out
of
the
frisco
office
boyd
grimaced
you
know
he
said
i
had
a
good
thing
going
for
me
out
there
of
the
entire
office
but
right
after
that
job
we
did
together
the
queen
elizabeth
affair
burris
decided
i
was
too
good
a
man
to
waste
my
fragrance
on
the
desert
air
or
whatever
it
is
so
he
recalled
me
assigned
me
from
the
home
office
and
i
been
on
one
case
after
another
ever
since
you
a
agent
now
malone
said
i
a
roving
reporter
boyd
said
and
struck
a
pose
i
a
general
and
a
just
like
you
hero
thanks
malone
said
how
about
the
local
office
here
seen
the
boys
yet
boyd
shook
his
head
not
yet
he
said
i
was
waiting
for
you
to
show
up
but
i
did
manage
hotel
rooms
a
couple
of
rooms
with
a
connecting
bath
over
at
the
hotel
new
yorker
nice
place
you
like
it
ken
i
love
it
malone
said
especially
that
connecting
bath
it
would
have
been
terrible
to
have
an
unconnecting
bath
sort
of
distracting
okay
boyd
said
okay
you
know
what
i
mean
he
stared
down
at
malone
hand
you
know
you
still
got
your
lighter
on
he
added
malone
looked
down
at
it
and
shut
it
off
you
asked
me
to
hold
it
he
said
i
did
mean
indefinitely
boyd
said
anyhow
how
about
grabbing
a
cab
and
heading
on
down
to
the
hotel
to
get
your
stuff
away
before
we
check
in
at
street
good
idea
malone
said
and
besides
i
could
do
with
a
clean
shirt
not
to
mention
a
bath
trains
get
worse
and
worse
boyd
said
absently
malone
punched
the
redcap
buttons
again
and
he
and
boyd
followed
it
through
the
crowded
station
to
the
taxi
stand
the
robot
piled
the
suitcases
into
the
cab
and
somehow
malone
and
boyd
found
room
for
themselves
hotel
new
yorker
boyd
said
grandly
the
driver
swung
around
to
stare
at
them
blinked
and
finally
said
okay
mac
you
said
it
he
started
with
a
terrific
grinding
of
gears
drove
out
of
the
penn
station
arch
and
went
two
blocks
here
you
are
mac
he
said
stopping
the
cab
malone
stared
at
boyd
with
a
reproachful
expression
so
how
was
i
to
know
boyd
said
i
did
look
if
i
known
it
was
so
close
we
could
walked
and
saved
half
a
buck
malone
said
but
do
let
it
bother
you
this
is
money
that
right
boyd
said
he
beamed
and
tipped
the
driver
heavily
the
cab
drove
off
and
malone
hailed
the
new
yorker
doorman
who
equipped
them
with
a
robot
bellhop
and
sent
them
upstairs
to
their
rooms
of
an
hour
later
boyd
and
malone
were
in
the
offices
of
the
federal
bureau
of
investigation
on
east
street
there
they
picked
up
a
lot
of
nice
new
shiny
facts
it
was
unfortunate
if
not
particularly
surprising
that
the
facts
did
not
seem
to
make
any
sense
in
the
first
place
only
red
cadillacs
seemed
to
be
involved
anybody
who
owned
such
a
car
was
likely
to
find
it
missing
at
any
time
there
had
been
a
lot
of
thefts
reported
including
some
that
had
had
time
to
get
into
burris
reports
new
jersey
now
claimed
two
victims
and
new
york
had
three
of
its
own
and
all
the
cars
were
turning
up
in
new
york
by
any
means
some
of
the
new
york
cars
had
turned
up
in
new
jersey
some
had
turned
up
in
connecticut
including
one
of
the
new
jersey
cars
so
far
there
had
been
neither
thefts
nor
discoveries
in
pennsylvania
but
malone
could
see
why
there
was
absolutely
no
pattern
that
he
boyd
or
anyone
else
could
find
the
list
of
thefts
and
recoveries
had
been
fed
into
an
electronic
calculator
which
had
neatly
regurgitated
them
without
being
in
the
least
helpful
it
had
remarked
that
the
square
of
seven
was
but
this
was
traced
to
a
defect
in
the
mechanism
whoever
was
borrowing
the
red
caddies
exhibited
a
peculiar
combination
of
burglarious
genius
and
what
looked
to
malone
like
outright
idiocy
this
was
plainly
impossible
unfortunately
it
had
happened
locking
the
car
doors
did
do
a
bit
of
good
the
thief
or
thieves
got
in
without
so
much
as
scratching
the
lock
this
obviously
proved
that
the
criminal
was
either
an
extremely
good
or
else
knew
where
to
get
duplicate
keys
however
the
ignition
was
invariably
shorted
across
this
proved
neatly
that
the
criminal
was
not
a
very
good
and
did
not
know
where
to
get
duplicate
keys
query
why
work
so
hard
on
the
doors
and
not
work
at
all
on
the
ignition
that
was
the
first
place
the
second
place
was
just
what
had
been
bothering
malone
all
along
there
did
seem
to
be
any
purpose
to
the
car
thefts
they
had
been
sold
or
used
as
getaway
cars
true
teenage
delinquents
sometimes
stole
cars
just
to
use
them
or
as
some
sort
of
prank
but
a
car
or
two
every
night
how
many
can
one
gang
take
malone
thought
and
how
long
does
it
take
to
get
tired
of
the
same
prank
and
why
malone
asked
himself
wearily
for
what
was
beginning
to
feel
like
the
ten
thousandth
time
why
only
red
cadillacs
burris
he
told
himself
must
have
been
right
all
along
the
red
cadillacs
were
only
a
smoke
screen
for
something
else
perhaps
it
was
the
robot
car
perhaps
not
but
whatever
it
was
burris
general
answer
was
the
only
one
that
made
any
sense
at
all
that
should
have
been
a
comforting
thought
malone
reflected
somehow
though
it
was
after
they
finished
with
the
files
and
personnel
at
street
malone
and
boyd
started
downtown
on
what
turned
out
to
be
a
sort
of
unguided
tour
of
the
new
york
police
department
they
spoke
to
some
of
the
eyewitnesses
and
ended
up
in
centre
street
asking
a
lot
of
reasonably
useless
questions
in
the
bureau
of
motor
vehicles
in
general
they
spent
nearly
six
hours
on
the
affair
of
the
cadillac
picking
up
a
whole
bundle
of
facts
some
of
the
facts
they
had
already
known
some
were
new
but
unhelpful
somehow
nobody
felt
much
like
going
out
for
a
night
on
the
town
instead
both
agents
climbed
wearily
into
bed
thinking
morose
and
disillusioned
thoughts
and
after
that
a
week
passed
it
was
filled
with
ennui
only
one
new
thing
became
clear
in
spite
of
the
almost
identical
modus
operandi
used
in
all
the
car
thefts
they
were
obviously
the
work
of
a
gang
rather
than
a
single
person
this
required
the
assumption
that
there
was
not
one
insane
man
at
work
but
a
crew
of
them
all
identically
unbalanced
but
the
jobs
are
just
too
scattered
to
be
the
work
of
one
man
malone
said
to
steal
a
car
in
connecticut
and
drive
it
to
the
bronx
and
then
steal
another
car
in
westfield
new
jersey
fifteen
minutes
later
takes
more
than
talent
it
takes
an
outright
magician
this
conclusion
while
interesting
was
not
really
helpful
the
fact
was
that
malone
needed
more
clues
or
anyhow
more
facts
before
he
could
do
anything
at
all
and
there
just
were
any
new
facts
around
he
spent
the
week
wandering
morosely
from
one
place
to
another
sometimes
accompanied
by
thomas
boyd
and
sometimes
all
alone
time
he
knew
was
ticking
by
at
its
usual
rate
but
there
was
a
thing
he
could
do
about
it
he
did
try
to
relax
and
have
some
fun
as
burris
had
suggested
but
he
did
seem
to
be
able
to
get
his
mind
off
the
case
boyd
after
the
first
little
while
had
no
such
trouble
he
entered
the
social
life
of
the
city
with
a
whoop
of
joy
and
disappeared
from
sight
that
was
fine
for
boyd
malone
reflected
but
it
did
leave
malone
himself
just
a
little
bit
at
loose
ends
not
that
he
begrudged
boyd
his
fun
it
was
nice
that
one
of
them
was
enjoying
himself
anyway
it
was
just
that
malone
was
beginning
to
get
fidgety
he
needed
to
be
doing
something
even
if
it
was
only
taking
a
walk
so
he
took
a
walk
and
ended
up
to
his
own
surprise
downtown
near
greenwich
village
and
then
he
been
bopped
on
the
head
the
patrol
car
pulled
up
in
front
of
vincent
hospital
and
one
of
the
cops
helped
malone
into
the
emergency
receiving
room
he
feel
as
bad
as
he
had
a
few
minutes
before
the
motion
of
the
car
had
helped
any
but
his
head
seemed
to
be
knitting
a
little
and
his
legs
were
a
little
steadier
true
he
did
feel
one
hundred
per
cent
healthy
but
he
was
beginning
to
think
he
might
live
after
all
and
while
the
doctor
was
bandaging
his
head
a
spirit
of
new
life
began
to
fill
the
fbi
agent
he
was
no
longer
morose
and
undirected
he
had
a
purpose
in
life
and
the
purpose
filled
him
with
cold
determination
he
was
going
to
find
the
car
or
whatever
it
turned
out
to
be
the
doctor
malone
noticed
was
whistling
under
his
breath
as
he
worked
that
he
supposed
was
the
influence
of
the
bohemian
of
greenwich
village
but
he
put
the
noise
resolutely
out
of
his
mind
and
concentrated
on
the
red
cadillac
it
was
one
thing
to
think
about
a
robot
car
miles
away
doing
something
or
other
to
somebody
you
never
heard
of
before
that
was
just
theoretical
a
case
for
solution
nothing
but
an
ordinary
job
but
when
the
car
stepped
up
and
bopped
malone
himself
on
the
head
it
became
a
personal
matter
now
malone
had
more
than
a
job
to
contend
with
now
he
was
thinking
about
revenge
he
told
himself
car
in
the
world
not
even
a
cadillac
can
get
away
with
beaning
kenneth
malone
malone
was
not
quite
certain
that
he
agreed
with
burris
idea
of
a
car
but
at
least
it
was
something
to
work
on
a
car
that
could
reach
out
crown
an
investigator
and
then
drive
off
humming
something
innocent
under
its
breath
was
certainly
a
unique
and
dangerous
machine
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
of
course
there
were
problems
attendant
on
this
view
of
things
for
one
thing
malone
could
quite
see
how
the
car
could
have
beaned
him
when
he
was
ten
feet
away
from
it
but
that
was
he
told
himself
uncomfortably
a
minor
point
he
could
deal
with
it
when
he
felt
a
little
better
the
important
thing
was
the
car
itself
malone
jerked
a
little
under
the
doctor
calm
hands
and
swore
subvocally
hold
still
the
doctor
said
do
go
wiggling
your
head
around
that
way
just
wait
quietly
until
the
dermijel
sets
obediently
malone
froze
there
was
a
crick
in
his
neck
but
he
decided
he
could
stand
it
my
head
still
hurts
he
said
accusingly
sure
it
still
hurts
the
doctor
agreed
but
you
what
did
you
expect
the
doctor
said
even
an
fbi
agent
immune
to
blackjacks
you
know
he
resumed
his
work
on
skull
blackjacks
malone
said
what
blackjacks
the
ones
that
hit
you
the
doctor
said
or
the
one
anyhow
malone
blinked
somehow
though
he
could
manage
a
fuzzy
picture
of
a
car
reaching
out
to
hit
him
the
introduction
of
a
blackjack
into
this
imaginative
effort
confused
things
a
little
but
he
resolutely
ignored
it
the
bruise
is
just
the
right
size
and
shape
the
doctor
said
and
that
cut
on
your
head
comes
from
the
seams
on
the
leather
casing
you
sure
malone
said
doubtfully
it
did
seem
as
if
a
car
had
a
lot
more
dangerous
weapons
around
without
resorting
to
blackjacks
if
it
had
really
wanted
to
damage
him
why
had
it
hit
him
with
the
engine
block
i
sure
the
doctor
said
i
worked
in
emergency
in
this
hospital
long
enough
to
recognize
a
blackjack
wound
that
was
a
disturbing
idea
in
a
way
it
gave
a
new
color
to
reflection
on
greenwich
villagers
maybe
things
had
changed
since
heard
about
them
maybe
the
blackjack
had
supplanted
the
guitar
but
that
was
the
important
thing
the
fact
that
it
had
been
a
blackjack
that
had
hit
him
important
it
was
vital
as
a
matter
of
fact
malone
knew
that
perfectly
well
it
was
a
key
fact
in
the
case
he
was
investigating
the
only
trouble
was
that
he
did
see
what
if
anything
it
meant
the
doctor
stepped
back
and
regarded
malone
head
with
something
like
pride
there
he
said
you
be
all
right
now
a
concussion
sure
the
doctor
said
but
it
is
serious
just
take
these
pills
one
every
two
hours
until
they
gone
and
you
be
rid
of
any
effects
within
hours
he
went
to
a
cabinet
fiddled
around
for
a
minute
and
came
back
with
a
small
bottle
containing
six
orange
pills
they
looked
very
large
and
threatening
fine
malone
said
doubtfully
you
be
all
right
the
doctor
said
giving
malone
a
cheerful
confident
grin
nothing
at
all
to
worry
about
he
loaded
a
hypojet
and
blasted
something
through
the
skin
of
malone
upper
arm
malone
swallowed
hard
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
had
felt
a
thing
but
he
could
quite
make
himself
believe
it
that
take
care
of
you
for
tonight
the
doctor
said
get
some
sleep
and
start
in
on
the
pills
when
you
wake
up
okay
okay
malone
said
it
was
going
to
make
waking
up
something
less
than
a
pleasure
but
he
wanted
to
get
well
did
he
of
course
he
did
if
that
cadillac
thought
it
was
going
to
beat
him
you
can
stand
up
now
the
doctor
said
okay
malone
said
trying
it
thanks
doctor
i
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
doctor
jerked
his
head
around
who
that
he
said
me
a
bass
voice
said
unhelpfully
the
door
opened
a
crack
and
a
face
peered
in
it
took
malone
a
second
to
recognize
bill
the
cop
who
had
picked
him
up
next
to
the
lamp
post
three
years
or
so
before
long
time
no
see
malone
said
at
random
what
bill
said
and
opened
the
door
wider
he
came
in
and
closed
it
behind
him
it
okay
doc
he
said
to
the
attendant
i
a
cop
been
hurt
the
doctor
said
bill
shook
his
head
not
recently
he
said
i
came
to
see
this
guy
he
looked
at
malone
they
told
me
you
were
still
here
he
said
who
they
malone
said
outside
bill
said
the
attendants
out
there
they
said
you
were
still
getting
stitched
up
and
quite
right
too
malone
said
solemnly
oh
bill
said
sure
he
fished
in
his
pockets
you
dropped
your
notebook
though
and
i
came
to
give
it
back
to
you
he
located
the
object
he
was
hunting
for
and
brought
it
out
with
the
triumphant
gesture
of
a
man
displaying
the
head
of
a
dragon
he
had
slain
here
he
said
waving
the
book
notebook
malone
said
he
stared
at
it
it
was
a
small
looseleaf
book
bound
in
cheap
black
plastic
we
found
it
in
the
gutter
bill
said
malone
took
a
tentative
step
forward
and
managed
not
to
fall
he
stepped
back
again
and
looked
at
bill
scornfully
i
was
even
in
the
gutter
he
said
there
are
limits
sure
bill
said
but
the
notebook
was
so
i
brought
it
along
to
you
i
thought
you
might
need
it
or
something
he
handed
it
over
to
malone
with
a
flourish
it
was
malone
notebook
in
the
first
place
he
had
never
owned
a
notebook
that
looked
anything
like
that
and
in
the
second
place
he
had
had
any
notebooks
on
him
when
he
went
for
his
walk
not
to
question
malone
told
himself
with
a
shrug
and
flipped
the
book
open
at
once
he
saw
why
the
cop
had
mistaken
it
for
his
it
had
his
name
in
it
on
the
very
first
page
were
two
names
written
out
in
a
careful
semieducated
scrawl
kenneth
malone
peter
lynch
the
rest
of
the
page
was
blank
malone
wondered
who
lieutenant
lynch
was
and
made
a
mental
note
to
find
out
then
he
wondered
what
his
name
was
doing
in
somebody
else
notebook
maybe
he
thought
it
was
a
list
of
people
to
slug
and
the
car
had
made
it
up
but
he
heard
of
anybody
named
lynch
being
hit
on
the
head
by
a
marauding
automobile
and
he
could
quite
picture
a
cadillac
jotting
things
down
in
a
notebook
for
future
reference
besides
he
had
an
idea
that
a
cadillac
handwriting
would
be
more
formal
and
prettier
he
turned
the
page
on
the
next
leaf
there
were
more
names
eight
of
them
the
first
one
was
written
in
red
pencil
and
the
others
were
in
ordinary
black
malone
stared
at
them
la
de
los
del
all
the
names
except
mike
sounded
spanish
or
possibly
puerto
rican
malone
wondered
who
they
were
juvenile
delinquents
other
people
to
slug
police
officers
maybe
they
were
all
the
names
of
cadillacs
he
blinked
and
rubbed
at
his
forehead
with
one
hand
his
head
still
hurt
and
that
was
probably
why
he
was
getting
such
strange
ideas
it
was
obvious
that
whatever
the
notebook
was
it
had
been
written
by
an
automobile
he
turned
the
page
again
here
there
was
a
carefully
detailed
drawing
of
a
car
malone
recognized
it
as
a
cadillac
without
any
effort
at
all
and
it
had
been
carefully
colored
in
with
red
pencil
wow
malone
asked
himself
the
hell
does
that
mean
he
could
find
an
answer
he
turned
the
page
hoping
for
some
more
facts
that
might
make
some
sense
out
of
what
he
had
been
seeing
but
there
was
nothing
more
all
the
rest
of
the
pages
in
the
notebook
were
blank
he
looked
up
at
the
cop
and
the
doctor
with
a
bland
blank
face
thanks
a
lot
he
told
bill
i
thought
i
lost
this
book
i
appreciate
it
oh
that
okay
malone
bill
said
glad
to
do
it
you
do
know
what
this
means
to
me
malone
said
truthfully
no
trouble
at
all
bill
said
any
time
he
gave
malone
a
big
smile
and
turned
back
to
the
door
but
i
got
to
get
back
to
my
beat
he
said
listen
i
see
you
and
if
i
can
be
any
help
sure
malone
said
i
let
you
know
and
thanks
again
welcome
bill
said
and
opened
the
door
he
strode
out
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
just
been
decorated
with
the
silver
star
the
purple
heart
and
the
congressional
medal
of
honor
malone
tried
a
few
more
steps
and
discovered
that
he
could
walk
without
falling
down
he
thanked
the
doctor
again
perfectly
all
right
the
doctor
said
nothing
to
it
why
you
ought
to
see
some
of
the
cases
we
get
here
there
was
a
guy
here
the
other
night
with
both
his
legs
all
mashed
up
by
a
i
bet
malone
said
hurriedly
well
i
got
to
be
on
my
way
just
send
the
bill
to
fbi
headquarters
on
street
he
closed
the
door
on
the
doctor
enthusiastic
yes
and
went
on
down
the
hallway
and
out
into
the
street
at
seventh
avenue
and
greenwich
avenue
he
flagged
a
cab
it
was
a
hell
of
a
place
to
be
malone
thought
as
the
cab
drove
away
where
but
in
greenwich
village
did
avenues
intersect
each
other
without
so
much
as
a
hotel
new
yorker
he
said
giving
the
whole
thing
up
as
a
bad
job
he
put
his
hat
on
his
head
and
adjusted
it
painfully
to
the
proper
angle
and
that
he
thought
made
another
little
problem
the
car
had
not
only
hit
him
on
the
head
it
had
removed
his
hat
before
doing
so
and
then
replaced
it
it
had
only
fallen
off
when
he
started
to
get
up
against
the
lamp
post
nice
quiet
malone
thought
bitterly
he
fumed
in
silence
all
the
way
to
the
hotel
through
the
lobby
up
in
the
elevator
and
to
the
door
of
his
room
then
he
remembered
the
notebook
that
was
important
evidence
he
decided
to
tell
boyd
about
it
right
away
he
went
into
the
bathroom
and
tapped
gently
on
the
door
to
connecting
room
the
door
swung
open
boyd
apparently
was
still
out
painting
the
town
malone
considered
the
word
and
dropped
the
whole
phrase
with
a
sigh
at
any
rate
his
partner
was
nowhere
in
the
room
the
hell
with
it
malone
announced
loudly
to
no
one
in
particular
he
went
back
into
his
own
room
closed
the
door
and
got
wearily
ready
for
bed
dawn
came
and
then
daylight
and
then
a
lot
more
daylight
it
was
streaming
in
through
the
windows
with
careless
abandon
filling
the
room
with
a
lot
of
bright
sunshine
and
the
muggy
heat
of
the
city
from
the
street
below
the
cheerful
noises
of
traffic
and
pedestrians
floated
up
and
filled
malone
ears
he
got
up
turned
over
in
bed
and
tried
to
go
back
to
sleep
but
sleep
would
come
after
a
long
time
he
gave
up
and
swung
himself
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
standing
up
was
a
delicate
job
but
he
managed
it
feeling
rather
proud
of
himself
in
a
dim
semiconscious
sort
of
way
he
went
into
the
bathroom
brushed
his
teeth
and
then
opened
the
connecting
door
to
boyd
room
softly
boyd
was
home
he
lay
in
a
great
tangle
of
bedclothes
snoring
hideously
and
making
little
motions
with
his
hands
and
arms
like
a
beached
whale
malone
padded
over
to
him
and
dug
him
fiercely
in
the
ribs
come
on
he
said
wake
up
boyd
eyes
did
not
open
in
a
voice
as
hollow
as
a
zombie
he
said
my
head
hurts
ca
feel
any
worse
than
mine
malone
said
cheerily
this
he
reflected
was
not
quite
true
considering
everything
it
had
been
through
recently
his
head
felt
remarkably
like
its
old
carefree
self
you
feel
better
once
you
awake
no
i
wo
boyd
said
simply
he
jammed
his
head
under
a
pillow
and
began
to
snore
again
it
was
an
awesome
sound
like
a
man
strangling
to
death
in
chicken
fat
malone
sighed
and
poked
at
random
among
the
bedclothes
boyd
swore
distantly
and
malone
poked
him
again
the
sun
is
up
malone
said
and
all
the
little
pedestrians
are
chirping
it
is
time
to
rise
boyd
said
gah
and
withdrew
his
head
from
the
pillow
gently
as
if
he
were
afraid
he
were
going
to
fall
apart
he
rose
to
a
sitting
position
when
he
had
arrived
at
it
he
opened
his
eyes
now
malone
said
is
that
better
boyd
closed
his
eyes
again
no
he
said
come
on
malone
said
we
got
to
be
up
and
moving
i
up
boyd
said
his
eyes
flickered
open
but
i
ca
move
he
added
we
had
quite
a
time
last
night
we
malone
said
me
and
a
couple
of
girls
and
another
guy
just
people
i
met
boyd
started
to
stand
up
and
thought
better
of
it
just
having
a
good
time
that
all
malone
thought
of
reading
his
partner
a
lecture
on
the
evils
of
drink
and
decided
against
it
boyd
might
remember
it
and
use
it
against
him
sometime
then
he
realized
what
had
to
be
done
he
went
back
into
his
own
room
dialed
for
room
service
and
ordered
a
couple
of
pots
of
strong
black
coffee
by
the
time
a
good
deal
of
that
was
awash
in
boyd
intestinal
system
he
was
almost
capable
of
rational
connected
conversation
he
filled
himself
to
the
eyebrows
with
aspirins
and
other
remedies
and
actually
succeeded
in
getting
dressed
he
seemed
quite
proud
of
this
feat
okay
malone
said
now
we
have
to
go
downstairs
you
mean
outside
boyd
said
into
all
that
noise
he
winced
bite
the
bullet
malone
said
cheerfully
keep
a
stiff
upper
lip
nonsense
boyd
said
hunting
for
his
coat
with
a
doleful
air
have
you
ever
seen
anybody
with
a
loose
upper
lip
malone
busy
with
his
own
coat
did
bother
with
a
reply
he
managed
somehow
to
get
boyd
downstairs
and
bundled
into
a
cab
they
headed
for
street
there
he
made
several
phone
calls
the
first
of
course
was
to
burris
in
washington
after
that
he
got
the
new
york
police
commissioner
on
the
wire
and
finding
that
he
needed
still
more
authority
he
called
the
mayor
and
then
by
to
albany
the
governor
but
by
noon
he
had
everything
straightened
out
he
had
a
plan
fully
worked
out
in
his
mind
and
he
had
the
authority
to
go
ahead
with
it
now
he
could
make
his
final
call
they
completely
trustworthy
burris
had
told
him
not
only
that
but
they
have
a
clearance
for
this
kind
of
special
work
we
needed
them
before
good
malone
said
not
only
that
burris
told
him
they
damned
good
men
maybe
among
the
best
in
their
field
so
malone
made
his
last
call
to
the
firm
of
leibowitz
and
hardin
electronic
engineers
then
he
beckoned
to
boyd
i
do
see
what
i
been
sitting
around
here
for
all
this
time
his
partner
complained
i
could
have
been
home
sleeping
until
you
needed
me
i
need
you
now
malone
said
i
want
you
to
take
over
part
of
this
plan
boyd
nodded
sourly
oh
all
right
he
said
here
what
i
want
malone
said
every
red
cadillac
in
the
area
is
to
be
picked
up
for
inspection
i
do
care
why
make
up
a
reason
a
general
traffic
check
anything
you
please
you
can
work
that
end
of
it
out
with
the
commissioner
he
knows
about
it
and
willing
to
go
along
great
boyd
said
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
cars
there
are
in
a
city
this
size
well
we
do
want
all
of
them
malone
said
only
red
cadillacs
it
still
a
lot
boyd
said
if
there
were
only
three
malone
said
we
would
have
any
problems
and
would
that
be
nice
boyd
said
sure
malone
said
but
it
is
true
anyhow
i
want
every
one
of
those
cars
checked
for
any
oddity
no
matter
how
small
if
there
an
scratch
on
one
fender
i
want
to
know
about
it
if
got
to
take
the
cars
apart
then
do
that
me
boyd
said
all
by
myself
my
god
no
malone
said
use
your
head
there
be
a
team
working
with
you
let
me
explain
it
every
nut
every
bolt
every
inch
of
those
cars
has
to
be
examined
thoroughly
got
it
i
got
it
boyd
said
but
i
damned
if
i
like
it
after
all
malone
malone
ignored
him
the
governor
of
new
york
promised
his
cooperation
he
said
and
he
said
he
get
in
touch
with
the
governors
of
new
jersey
and
connecticut
and
get
cooperation
from
that
angle
so
we
have
both
state
and
local
police
working
with
us
that
a
help
boyd
said
we
make
such
a
happy
team
of
workmen
singing
as
we
pull
the
cars
apart
through
the
long
day
and
night
and
listen
malone
when
do
you
want
reports
on
this
yesterday
malone
said
boyd
eyebrows
raised
then
lowered
great
he
said
dully
i
do
care
how
you
get
the
cars
malone
said
if
you
got
to
condemn
but
get
every
last
one
of
them
and
bring
them
over
to
leibowitz
and
hardin
for
a
complete
checkup
i
give
you
the
address
thanks
boyd
said
not
at
all
malone
said
glad
to
be
of
help
and
do
worry
have
other
work
to
do
he
paused
and
then
went
on
i
talked
to
isaac
leibowitz
he
the
head
of
the
firm
out
there
and
he
says
wait
a
minute
boyd
said
what
you
mean
i
do
have
to
take
the
cars
apart
myself
you
mean
this
leibowitz
and
hardin
or
whatever
it
is
will
do
it
for
me
of
course
malone
said
wearily
you
not
an
auto
technician
or
an
electronics
man
you
an
agent
of
the
fbi
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
boyd
said
after
all
anyhow
malone
said
doggedly
i
talked
to
leibowitz
and
he
says
he
can
give
a
car
a
complete
check
in
about
six
hours
normally
six
hours
boyd
stared
that
going
to
take
forever
he
said
well
he
can
set
up
a
kind
of
process
and
turn
out
a
car
every
fifteen
minutes
any
better
boyd
nodded
good
malone
said
there
ca
be
so
many
red
cadillacs
in
the
area
that
we
ca
get
through
them
all
at
that
speed
he
thought
a
minute
and
then
added
by
the
way
you
might
check
with
the
cadillac
dealers
around
town
and
find
out
just
how
many
have
been
sold
to
people
living
in
the
area
and
while
i
doing
all
that
boyd
said
what
are
you
going
to
be
doing
malone
looked
at
him
and
sighed
i
worry
about
that
he
said
just
get
started
suppose
leibowitz
ca
find
anything
boyd
said
if
leibowitz
ca
find
it
it
not
there
malone
said
he
can
find
electronic
devices
anywhere
in
any
car
made
he
says
even
if
they
printed
circuits
hidden
under
the
paint
job
pretty
good
boyd
said
but
suppose
he
does
then
they
are
there
malone
said
and
we
have
to
think
of
something
else
he
considered
that
it
sounded
fine
only
he
wished
he
knew
what
else
there
was
to
think
of
well
that
was
just
pessimism
leibowitz
would
find
something
and
the
case
would
be
over
and
he
could
go
back
to
washington
and
rest
in
august
he
was
going
to
have
his
vacation
anyway
and
august
very
far
away
malone
put
a
smile
carefully
on
his
face
and
told
boyd
get
going
he
slammed
his
hat
on
his
head
wincing
he
took
it
off
and
replaced
it
gently
the
bottle
of
pills
was
still
in
his
pocket
but
he
was
due
for
another
one
just
yet
he
had
time
to
go
over
to
the
precinct
station
in
the
west
eighties
first
he
headed
outside
to
get
another
taxi
the
door
did
say
anything
at
all
except
malone
looked
at
it
for
a
couple
of
seconds
he
asked
the
desk
sergeant
for
lynch
shown
his
credentials
and
been
directed
up
a
set
of
stairs
and
around
a
hall
but
he
still
did
know
what
lynch
did
who
he
was
or
what
his
name
was
doing
in
the
little
black
notebook
well
he
told
himself
there
was
only
one
way
to
find
out
he
opened
the
door
the
room
was
small
and
dark
it
had
a
single
desk
in
it
and
three
chairs
and
a
hatrack
there
was
any
coat
or
hat
on
the
hatrack
and
there
was
nobody
in
the
chairs
in
a
fourth
chair
behind
the
desk
sat
a
huskily
built
man
he
had
hair
a
hard
jaw
and
malone
noticed
with
surprise
a
faint
twinkle
in
his
eye
lieutenant
lynch
malone
said
right
lynch
said
what
the
trouble
i
kenneth
malone
fbi
he
reached
for
his
wallet
and
found
it
he
flipped
it
open
for
lynch
who
stared
at
it
for
what
seemed
a
long
long
time
and
then
burst
into
laughter
what
so
funny
malone
asked
lynch
laughed
some
more
oh
come
on
malone
said
bitterly
after
all
there
no
reason
to
treat
an
fbi
agent
like
some
kind
of
a
fbi
agent
lynch
said
listen
buster
this
is
the
funniest
gag
i
seen
since
i
came
on
the
force
really
a
hell
of
a
funny
thing
who
told
you
to
pull
it
jablonski
downstairs
or
one
of
the
boys
on
the
beat
i
know
those
beat
patrolmen
always
on
the
lookout
for
a
new
but
this
tops
all
this
is
the
you
a
disgrace
to
the
irish
malone
said
tartly
a
what
lynch
said
i
not
irish
you
talk
like
an
irishman
malone
said
i
know
it
lynch
said
and
shrugged
around
some
precincts
you
sort
of
pick
it
up
when
all
the
other
cops
are
hey
listen
how
we
get
to
talking
about
me
i
said
you
were
a
disgrace
to
the
irish
malone
said
i
was
a
disgrace
malone
looked
carefully
at
lynch
in
a
fight
he
considered
he
might
get
in
a
lucky
punch
that
would
kill
malone
otherwise
malone
did
have
a
thing
to
worry
about
except
a
few
months
of
hospitalization
lynch
looked
as
if
he
were
about
to
get
mad
and
then
he
looked
down
at
malone
wallet
again
and
started
to
laugh
for
god
sake
malone
said
what
so
damned
funny
he
grabbed
the
wallet
and
turned
it
toward
him
at
once
of
course
he
realized
what
had
happened
he
had
flipped
it
open
to
his
badge
at
all
he
flipped
it
open
instead
to
a
card
in
the
card
case
know
all
men
by
these
presents
that
sir
kenneth
malone
knight
is
hereby
formally
installed
with
the
title
of
knight
of
the
bath
and
this
card
shall
signify
his
right
to
that
title
and
his
high
and
respected
position
as
officer
in
and
of
the
queen
own
fbi
in
a
very
small
voice
malone
said
there
been
a
terrible
mistake
mistake
lynch
said
malone
flipped
the
wallet
open
to
his
fbi
shield
lynch
gave
it
a
good
long
examination
peering
at
it
from
every
angle
and
holding
it
up
to
the
light
two
or
three
times
he
even
wet
his
thumb
and
rubbed
the
badge
with
it
at
last
he
looked
up
i
guess
you
are
the
fbi
he
said
but
what
with
the
gag
it
is
a
gag
malone
said
it
just
he
thought
of
the
little
old
lady
in
yucca
flats
the
little
old
lady
who
had
been
the
prime
mover
in
the
last
case
he
and
boyd
had
worked
on
together
without
the
little
old
lady
the
case
might
never
have
been
solved
she
was
an
authentic
telepath
about
the
best
that
had
ever
been
found
but
with
her
boyd
and
malone
had
had
enough
troubles
besides
being
a
telepath
she
was
quite
thoroughly
insane
she
had
one
fixed
delusion
she
believed
she
was
queen
elizabeth
i
she
was
still
at
yucca
flats
along
with
the
other
telepaths
investigation
had
turned
up
and
she
still
believed
quite
calmly
that
she
was
good
queen
bess
malone
had
been
knighted
by
her
during
the
course
of
the
investigation
this
new
honor
had
come
to
him
through
the
mail
apparently
she
had
decided
to
ennoble
some
of
her
friends
still
further
malone
made
a
mental
note
to
ask
boyd
if
he
received
one
after
all
there
could
be
too
many
knights
of
the
bath
there
was
no
sense
in
letting
in
then
he
realized
that
he
was
beginning
to
believe
everything
again
there
had
been
times
working
with
the
little
old
lady
when
he
had
been
firmly
convinced
that
he
was
in
fact
the
swaggering
ruthless
swordsman
sir
kenneth
malone
and
even
now
well
lynch
said
it
too
long
a
story
malone
said
and
besides
it
not
what
i
came
here
about
lynch
shrugged
again
okay
he
said
tell
it
your
way
first
malone
said
what
your
job
me
precinct
lieutenant
of
this
precinct
lynch
stared
what
else
he
said
who
knows
malone
said
he
found
the
black
notebook
and
passed
it
across
to
lynch
i
on
this
red
cadillac
business
you
know
he
said
by
way
of
introduction
i
been
hearing
about
it
lynch
said
he
picked
up
the
notebook
without
opening
it
and
held
it
like
a
ticking
bomb
and
i
mean
hearing
about
it
he
said
we
have
had
any
trouble
at
all
in
this
precinct
i
know
malone
said
i
read
the
reports
listen
not
a
single
red
cadillac
has
been
stolen
from
here
or
been
reported
found
here
we
run
a
tight
precinct
here
and
let
me
tell
you
i
sure
you
do
a
fine
job
malone
said
hastily
but
i
want
you
to
look
at
the
notebook
the
first
page
lynch
opened
his
mouth
closed
it
and
then
flipped
the
notebook
cover
he
stared
at
the
first
page
for
a
few
seconds
what
this
he
said
at
last
another
gag
no
gag
lieutenant
malone
said
it
your
name
and
mine
lynch
said
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
malone
shrugged
search
me
he
said
the
notebook
was
found
only
a
couple
of
feet
away
from
another
car
theft
last
night
that
was
the
simplest
way
he
could
think
of
to
put
it
so
i
asked
the
commissioner
who
peter
lynch
was
and
he
told
me
it
was
you
and
by
god
it
is
lynch
said
staring
at
the
notebook
he
seemed
to
be
expecting
it
to
rise
and
strike
him
malone
said
have
you
got
any
idea
who
be
writing
about
you
and
me
lynch
shook
his
head
if
i
had
any
ideas
i
feel
a
lot
better
he
said
he
wet
his
finger
and
turned
the
notebook
page
carefully
over
when
he
saw
the
list
of
names
on
the
second
page
he
stopped
again
and
stared
this
time
he
whistled
under
his
breath
very
cautiously
malone
said
something
i
be
damned
lynch
said
feelingly
what
wrong
malone
said
the
police
lieutenant
looked
up
i
do
know
if
it
wrong
or
what
he
said
it
gives
me
sort
of
the
willies
i
know
every
one
of
these
kids
malone
took
out
a
pill
and
swallowed
it
in
a
hurry
he
felt
exactly
as
if
he
had
been
given
another
concussion
absolutely
free
and
without
any
obligations
his
mouth
opened
but
nothing
came
out
for
a
long
time
at
last
he
managed
to
say
kids
that
right
lynch
said
what
did
you
think
malone
shrugged
helplessly
every
single
one
of
them
lynch
said
right
from
around
here
there
was
a
little
silence
who
are
they
malone
said
carefully
they
some
kind
of
kid
gang
a
social
club
or
something
like
that
this
first
kid
miguel
fueyo
his
full
name
is
the
leader
they
call
themselves
the
silent
spooks
the
what
it
seemed
to
malone
that
the
name
was
just
a
little
fancy
even
for
a
kid
gang
the
silent
spooks
lynch
said
i
ca
help
it
but
here
they
are
every
one
of
them

right
down
the
line
he
looked
up
from
the
notebook
with
a
blank
expression
on
his
face
all
of
them
kids
from
this
neighborhood
the
silent
spooks
they
know
you
malone
said
sure
they
do
lynch
said
they
all
know
me
but
do
they
know
you
malone
thought
they
could
have
heard
of
me
he
said
at
last
trying
to
be
as
modest
as
possible
i
guess
lynch
said
grudgingly
how
old
are
they
malone
said
fourteen
to
seventeen
lynch
said
somewhere
in
there
you
know
how
these
kid
things
run
the
silent
spooks
malone
said
meditatively
it
was
a
nice
name
in
a
way
you
just
had
to
get
used
to
it
for
a
while
when
he
had
been
a
kid
he
belonged
to
a
group
that
called
itself
the
east
division
street
kids
there
just
was
much
romance
in
a
name
like
that
now
the
silent
spooks
with
a
wrench
he
brought
his
mind
back
to
the
subject
at
hand
do
they
get
into
much
trouble
he
said
well
no
lynch
said
reluctantly
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
do
for
a
bunch
like
that
around
here
they
pretty
well
behaved
as
far
as
that
goes
what
do
you
mean
malone
said
lynch
face
took
on
a
delicately
unconcerned
appearance
i
know
he
said
they
just
do
get
into
neighborhood
trouble
maybe
a
scrap
now
and
then
nothing
big
though
or
maybe
one
of
them
cuts
a
class
at
school
or
argues
with
his
teacher
but
there
nothing
unusual
and
damn
little
of
anything
he
frowned
malone
said
something
got
to
be
wrong
what
is
it
well
lynch
said
they
do
seem
to
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
to
spend
malone
sat
down
in
a
chair
across
the
desk
and
leaned
eagerly
toward
lynch
money
he
said
money
lynch
said
new
clothes
cigarettes
malone
three
of
them
are
even
supporting
their
parents
old
jose
otravez
ramon
old
man
quit
his
job
a
couple
of
months
ago
and
has
worked
since
spends
all
his
time
in
bars
and
never
runs
out
of
dough
and
tell
me
you
can
do
that
on
unemployment
insurance
or
social
security
payments
okay
malone
said
i
wo
tell
you
and
there
others
all
the
others
in
fact
mike
fueyo
sister
dresses
fit
to
kill
like
a
model
and
the
grito
kid
wait
a
minute
malone
said
from
what
you
tell
me
this
is
just
a
little
extra
money
these
kids
must
be
rolling
in
the
stuff
up
to
their
ears
in
dough
listen
lynch
said
sadly
those
kids
spend
more
than
i
do
hell
they
do
better
than
that
they
spend
more
than
i
he
looked
remotely
sorry
for
himself
but
not
for
long
every
one
of
those
kids
spends
like
a
drunken
sailor
tossing
his
money
away
on
all
sorts
of
things
like
an
expense
account
malone
said
idly
lynch
looked
up
sorry
malone
said
i
was
thinking
about
something
else
i
bet
you
were
lynch
said
with
unconcealed
envy
no
malone
said
really
listen
i
check
with
internal
revenue
on
that
money
but
have
you
got
a
list
of
the
kids
addresses
i
can
get
one
lynch
said
and
went
to
the
door
it
closed
behind
him
malone
sat
waiting
alone
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
lynch
came
back
list
be
here
in
a
minute
he
said
he
sat
down
behind
his
desk
and
reached
for
the
notebook
again
when
he
turned
to
the
third
page
his
expression
changed
to
one
of
surprise
be
damned
he
said
there
does
seem
to
be
a
connection
there
he
held
up
the
picture
of
the
red
cadillac
for
malone
to
see
sure
does
malone
said
that
why
i
want
those
addresses
if
there
is
a
connection
i
sure
as
hell
want
to
find
out
about
it
ten
minutes
later
malone
was
walking
out
of
the
precinct
station
with
the
list
of
addresses
in
his
pocket
he
was
heading
for
his
great
adventure
but
he
did
know
it
all
he
was
thinking
about
was
the
red
cadillacs
and
the
eight
teenagers
i
going
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
if
it
takes
me
all
summer
he
said
muttering
to
himself
that
the
spirit
he
told
himself
never
say
die
then
realizing
he
had
just
said
it
he
frowned
perhaps
it
really
counted
but
then
again
he
was
on
his
way
down
the
steps
when
he
hit
the
girl
the
mutual
collision
was
not
catastrophic
on
the
other
hand
it
was
not
exactly
minor
it
fell
somewhere
between
the
two
as
an
unclassifiable
phenomenon
of
undoubted
potency
malone
said
oog
with
some
fervor
as
the
girl
collided
with
his
chest
and
rebounded
like
a
handball
striking
a
wall
something
was
happening
to
her
but
malone
had
no
time
to
spare
to
notice
just
what
he
was
falling
through
space
touching
a
concrete
step
once
in
a
while
but
not
long
enough
to
make
any
real
acquaintance
with
it
it
seemed
to
take
him
a
long
time
to
touch
bottom
and
when
he
had
he
wondered
if
was
quite
the
word
certainly
was
he
had
fallen
backward
and
landed
directly
on
his
obeying
the
law
regarding
equal
and
opposite
reaction
and
several
other
laws
involving
falling
bodies
his
first
thought
was
that
he
was
now
neatly
balanced
his
tail
had
received
the
same
treatment
as
his
head
he
wondered
if
a
person
could
get
concussion
of
the
tail
bones
and
had
reached
no
definite
conclusion
when
unexpectedly
his
eyes
focused
again
he
was
looking
at
a
girl
that
was
all
he
saw
at
first
she
had
apparently
fallen
just
as
he
had
bounced
once
and
sat
down
rather
hard
she
was
now
lying
flat
on
her
back
making
a
sound
like
rrr
between
her
teeth
malone
discovered
that
he
was
sitting
undignifiedly
on
the
steps
he
opened
his
mouth
to
say
something
objectionable
took
another
look
at
the
girl
and
shut
it
with
a
snap
this
was
no
ordinary
girl
he
smiled
at
her
she
shook
her
head
and
sat
up
still
going
rrr
then
she
stopped
and
said
instead
what
do
you
think
i
sorry
malone
said
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
charming
debonair
and
apologetic
voice
it
was
quite
a
lot
to
get
into
one
voice
but
he
tried
his
very
hardest
i
just
did
see
you
did
the
girl
said
she
took
a
long
slow
look
at
him
shook
her
head
again
and
then
pulled
her
skirt
down
carefully
if
you
did
you
must
be
blind
she
said
malone
noticed
with
hope
that
there
was
no
anger
in
her
voice
the
last
thing
in
the
world
he
wanted
was
to
get
this
girl
angry
at
him
oh
no
malone
said
i
not
blind
not
blind
at
all
he
smiled
at
her
and
stood
up
his
tail
throbbed
a
little
but
it
did
seem
to
be
anything
really
serious
i
just
polite
he
said
and
smiled
again
his
face
was
beginning
to
get
a
little
tired
but
he
retained
his
last
smile
as
he
went
over
to
her
extended
a
hand
and
pulled
her
to
her
feet
she
was
something
special
her
hair
was
long
and
dark
and
fell
in
soft
waves
to
her
shoulders
the
shoulders
were
something
all
by
themselves
but
malone
postponed
consideration
of
them
for
a
minute
to
take
a
look
at
her
face
it
was
and
rather
thin
she
had
large
brown
liquid
eyes
that
could
look
malone
imagined
appealing
loving
worshiping
or
like
a
minute
ago
downright
furious
below
these
features
she
had
a
straight
lovely
nose
and
a
pair
of
lips
which
malone
immediately
classified
as
kissable
her
figure
including
the
shoulders
was
on
the
slim
side
but
she
was
very
definitely
all
there
malone
could
think
of
any
parts
the
creator
had
left
out
and
if
there
were
any
he
did
want
to
hear
about
them
in
an
instant
malone
knew
that
he
had
met
the
only
great
love
of
his
life
again
his
mind
was
whirling
and
for
a
second
he
did
know
what
to
do
and
then
he
remembered
the
queen
own
fbi
phrases
flowered
forth
in
his
mind
as
if
it
were
a
garden
packed
corner
to
corner
with
the
most
exquisite
varieties
of
blooming
idiots
my
deepest
apologies
my
dear
sir
kenneth
malone
said
gallantly
even
managing
a
small
display
bow
for
the
occasion
may
i
be
of
any
assistance
the
girl
smiled
up
at
him
as
she
came
to
her
feet
the
smile
was
radiant
and
beautiful
and
almost
loving
malone
felt
as
if
he
stand
it
tingles
of
the
most
wonderful
kind
ran
through
him
reached
his
toes
and
then
back
the
other
way
meeting
a
whole
new
set
going
forward
you
very
nice
the
girl
said
and
the
tingles
became
positive
waves
of
sensation
actually
it
was
all
my
fault
please
apologize
she
paused
expectantly
me
malone
said
his
gallantry
deserting
him
for
the
second
but
it
returned
full
force
before
he
expected
it
i
malone
he
said
kenneth
joseph
malone
he
had
always
liked
the
middle
name
he
had
inherited
from
his
father
but
he
never
had
much
opportunity
to
use
it
he
made
the
most
of
it
now
rolling
it
out
with
all
sorts
of
subsidiary
flourishes
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
barely
restrained
himself
from
putting
a
sir
before
his
name
the
girl
brown
eyes
widened
just
a
trifle
malone
felt
as
if
he
could
have
fallen
into
them
and
drowned
oh
my
she
said
you
must
be
a
detective
and
then
like
the
merest
afterthought
my
dorothy
it
was
a
beautiful
name
it
made
malone
feel
all
choked
up
inside
he
blinked
at
the
girl
and
tried
to
look
manly
and
wonderful
it
was
an
effort
but
he
nearly
carried
it
off
after
a
second
or
two
he
realized
that
she
had
asked
him
a
question
he
did
want
to
disillusion
her
in
any
way
and
after
all
an
fbi
agent
was
a
kind
of
detective
but
he
thought
it
was
only
fair
that
she
should
know
the
whole
truth
about
him
right
from
the
start
not
exactly
a
detective
he
said
not
exactly
she
said
looking
puzzled
she
looked
positively
glorious
when
puzzled
malone
decided
at
once
that
is
he
said
carefully
i
do
detect
but
not
for
the
city
of
new
york
oh
she
said
a
private
eye
is
that
right
well
malone
said
no
she
looked
even
more
puzzled
malone
hastened
to
explain
before
he
got
to
the
point
where
conversation
was
impossible
federal
bureau
of
investigation
he
said
after
a
second
he
thought
of
a
clarification
and
added
fbi
oh
the
girl
said
oh
but
you
can
call
me
ken
malone
said
all
right
ken
she
said
and
you
call
me
dorothy
sure
he
said
he
tried
it
out
dorothy
it
felt
swell
well
she
said
after
a
second
oh
malone
said
were
you
looking
for
a
detective
because
if
i
can
help
in
any
way
not
exactly
dorothy
said
just
a
little
routine
business
i
go
on
in
and
malone
suddenly
found
himself
talking
without
having
any
idea
why
started
or
what
he
was
going
to
say
at
first
he
said
urr
as
if
the
machine
were
warming
up
and
this
stopped
dorothy
and
caused
her
to
give
him
a
rather
sharp
baffled
stare
then
he
found
some
words
and
used
them
hurriedly
before
they
got
away
dorothy
he
said
would
you
like
to
take
in
a
show
this
evening
i
think
i
can
get
tickets
to
well
i
guess
i
could
get
tickets
to
almost
anything
if
i
really
tried
his
expression
attempted
to
leave
no
doubt
that
he
would
really
try
dorothy
appeared
to
consider
for
a
moment
well
she
said
at
last
how
about
hot
malone
felt
just
the
way
he
had
several
years
before
when
he
had
bluffed
his
way
into
a
gigantic
pot
during
a
washington
poker
game
with
only
a
pair
of
fours
to
work
with
at
the
last
moment
his
bluff
had
been
called
it
had
he
realized
been
called
again
hot
had
set
some
sort
of
record
not
only
for
broadway
longevity
but
for
audience
frenzy
getting
tickets
for
it
was
about
the
same
kind
of
proposition
as
buying
grass
on
the
moon
and
getting
them
with
absolutely
no
prior
notice
would
require
all
the
malone
could
manage
he
thought
about
hot
and
wished
dorothy
had
picked
something
easy
like
arranging
for
her
to
meet
the
senate
but
he
swallowed
bravely
i
do
my
best
he
said
got
any
second
choice
sure
she
said
and
laughed
pick
any
one
you
want
i
have
seen
them
all
and
the
ones
i
have
seen
are
worth
seeing
again
oh
malone
said
i
really
did
expect
you
to
get
tickets
for
hot
she
said
nothing
malone
said
is
impossible
he
grinned
at
her
meanwhile
where
can
i
pick
you
up
your
home
dorothy
frowned
and
shook
her
head
no
she
said
you
see
living
with
an
aunt
and
i
well
never
mind
she
thought
for
a
minute
i
know
she
said
topp
what
malone
said
topp
dorothy
said
on
street
just
east
of
broadway
it
a
restaurant
i
do
exactly
know
where
it
is
malone
said
but
if
it
there
i
find
it
he
looked
gallant
and
determined
we
can
get
something
to
eat
there
before
the
show
whatever
the
show
turns
out
to
be
fine
dorothy
said
how
about
making
it
at
six
malone
said
she
nodded
six
it
is
she
said
now
she
touched
her
forefinger
to
her
lips
and
brushed
malone
cheek
with
the
kissed
finger
by
the
time
the
new
set
of
tingles
had
begun
to
evaporate
she
had
gone
into
the
police
station
malone
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
passion
and
held
down
a
strong
impulse
to
follow
her
and
protect
her
he
was
quite
sure
what
he
was
going
to
protect
her
from
but
he
felt
certain
that
that
would
come
to
him
when
the
time
arrived
nevertheless
he
had
work
to
do
unpleasant
as
the
idea
had
suddenly
begun
to
seem
he
pulled
the
list
of
addresses
out
of
his
pocket
and
looked
at
the
first
one
mike
was
the
leader
of
the
silent
spooks
according
to
lieutenant
lynch
logically
therefore
he
would
be
the
first
one
to
talk
to
malone
tried
to
think
of
some
good
questions
but
the
best
one
he
could
come
up
with
was
well
what
about
all
those
red
cadillacs
somehow
he
doubted
that
this
would
provide
a
satisfactory
reply
he
checked
the
address
again
and
started
firmly
down
the
street
trying
to
think
of
some
better
questions
along
the
way
the
building
was
just
off
amsterdam
avenue
in
the
eighties
it
had
been
a
shining
new
development
once
but
it
was
beginning
to
slide
downhill
now
the
metal
on
the
window
frames
was
beginning
to
look
worn
and
the
brickwork
had
been
cleaned
in
a
long
time
where
chain
fences
had
once
protected
lonely
blades
of
grass
children
mothers
and
baby
carriages
held
sway
now
and
the
grass
was
gone
instead
the
building
was
pretty
well
surrounded
by
a
moat
of
brown
dirt
malone
went
into
the
first
building
and
checked
the
name
against
the
mailboxes
there
trying
to
ignore
the
combined
smells
of
sour
milk
red
pepper
and
here
and
there
a
whiff
of
unwashed
humanity
it
was
on
the
tenth
floor
that
he
supposed
would
be
mike
widowed
mother
lynch
had
told
him
that
much
about
the
boy
and
his
family
he
found
the
elevator
which
was
covered
with
scribbles
ranging
from
janey
loves
miguel
to
startling
obscenities
and
rode
it
upstairs
apartment
looked
like
every
other
apartment
in
the
building
at
least
from
the
outside
malone
pressed
the
button
and
waited
a
second
to
hear
the
faint
buzzing
at
the
other
side
of
the
door
after
a
minute
he
pressed
it
again
the
door
swung
open
very
suddenly
and
malone
stepped
back
a
short
wrinkled
woman
in
a
print
housedress
was
eying
him
with
deep
suspicion
my
daughter
is
not
home
she
announced
at
once
i
not
looking
for
your
daughter
malone
said
i
like
to
talk
to
mike
mike
her
expression
grew
even
more
suspicious
you
want
to
talk
to
mike
that
right
malone
said
ah
the
woman
said
you
one
of
those
hoodlum
friends
he
has
right
you
can
talk
to
mike
when
i
am
dead
and
have
no
control
over
him
for
now
you
can
just
wait
a
minute
malone
said
he
pulled
out
his
wallet
and
flipped
it
open
to
show
his
badge
being
very
careful
that
he
made
the
right
flip
this
time
he
did
know
exactly
how
this
woman
would
react
to
the
queen
own
fbi
but
he
did
especially
want
to
find
out
she
looked
down
at
the
badge
without
taking
the
wallet
from
him
hah
she
said
you
cop
eh
her
eyes
left
the
wallet
and
examined
malone
from
head
to
foot
it
was
perfectly
plain
that
they
did
like
what
they
saw
cop
she
said
again
as
if
to
herself
it
sounded
like
a
curse
malone
said
well
i
you
want
to
ask
me
stupid
questions
she
said
that
is
what
you
want
to
do
i
right
i
only
i
know
nothing
she
said
nothing
of
any
kind
she
closed
her
mouth
and
stood
regarding
him
as
if
he
were
a
particularly
repulsive
statue
malone
looked
past
her
into
the
living
room
beyond
the
door
it
was
faded
now
but
it
had
once
been
bright
and
colorful
there
was
an
old
rug
on
the
floor
and
tables
were
everywhere
the
one
bright
thing
about
the
room
was
the
assortment
of
flowers
there
were
flowers
everywhere
in
vases
in
pots
and
even
in
window
boxes
there
was
also
a
lot
of
crockery
statuary
mostly
faded
chipped
or
worn
in
some
way
the
room
looked
to
malone
as
if
its
last
inhabitant
had
died
ten
years
before
only
the
flowers
had
been
renewed
everything
else
had
not
only
the
appearance
of
age
but
the
look
of
having
been
cast
up
as
a
mark
by
the
sea
which
had
receded
and
left
only
the
tangled
wreckage
the
woman
cleared
her
throat
and
malone
gaze
came
back
to
her
i
can
tell
you
nothing
she
said
i
do
want
to
talk
to
you
malone
said
again
i
want
to
talk
to
mike
her
eyes
were
very
cold
you
from
the
police
and
you
want
to
talk
to
mike
you
make
a
joke
only
i
do
think
the
joke
is
very
funny
joke
malone
said
you
mean
mike
not
here
her
gaze
never
wavered
you
know
he
is
not
she
said
ten
minutes
ago
the
policemen
were
taking
him
away
to
the
police
station
how
then
could
he
be
here
ten
minutes
ago
malone
blinked
ten
minutes
ago
he
had
been
looking
for
this
apartment
probably
it
had
taken
lynch
men
ten
minutes
to
find
it
they
were
strangers
in
new
york
he
was
arrested
malone
said
i
said
so
did
i
the
woman
said
you
must
be
crazy
or
else
something
her
eyes
were
still
cold
points
but
malone
suddenly
saw
a
glow
behind
them
the
glow
of
tears
mike
was
her
son
she
did
not
seem
surprised
that
the
police
had
taken
him
away
but
she
was
determined
to
protect
him
he
was
her
son
malone
voice
was
very
gentle
why
did
they
arrest
him
he
said
the
woman
shrugged
a
single
sharp
gesture
you
ask
me
this
she
said
i
not
a
cop
malone
said
i
from
the
fbi
i
do
know
anything
about
why
the
cops
might
have
arrested
mike
fbi
the
woman
said
it
all
right
malone
said
with
all
the
assurance
he
could
muster
i
only
want
to
talk
to
him
ah
the
woman
said
tears
were
plain
in
her
eyes
now
glittering
on
the
surface
why
they
take
him
away
i
do
not
know
my
mike
do
nothing
nothing
but
did
they
say
anything
about
they
say
the
woman
cried
they
say
only
they
have
orders
from
this
lieutenant
lynch
he
is
lieutenant
at
police
station
i
know
malone
said
gently
lieutenant
lynch
wants
to
ask
mike
questions
so
police
come
take
him
away
her
english
was
beginning
to
lose
ground
as
the
tears
came
closer
as
she
slowly
lost
control
lynch
asked
for
him
malone
said
he
frowned
whatever
that
meant
he
wanted
to
be
there
himself
and
perhaps
he
could
help
the
old
woman
in
some
way
anyhow
he
would
try
she
stared
up
at
him
stonily
look
fueyo
he
said
i
going
down
there
to
talk
to
mike
right
now
and
if
he
has
done
anything
i
see
that
he
gets
right
on
home
to
you
right
away
her
expression
changed
a
trifle
she
did
not
actually
soften
but
malone
could
feel
the
gratitude
lurking
behind
her
eyes
as
if
it
were
afraid
to
come
out
she
nodded
gravely
and
said
nothing
at
all
he
stepped
away
and
she
closed
the
door
without
a
sound
he
stood
staring
at
the
door
for
a
few
seconds
then
he
turned
and
punched
the
elevator
button
savagely
there
was
any
time
to
lose
he
walked
back
to
the
precinct
station
knowing
the
way
it
took
him
about
five
minutes
instead
of
the
fifteen
it
had
taken
him
to
find
the
fueyo
residence
but
he
still
felt
as
if
time
were
passing
much
too
fast
he
ran
up
the
steps
and
passed
right
by
the
desk
sergeant
who
apparently
recognized
him
he
said
nothing
as
malone
charged
up
the
stairs
and
around
the
hall
to
lynch
office
it
was
empty
malone
stared
at
it
and
started
down
the
hall
again
without
knowing
where
he
was
heading
halfway
to
the
stairs
he
met
a
patrolman
where
lynch
he
asked
the
lieutenant
the
patrolman
said
malone
fumed
who
else
he
said
where
is
he
got
some
kid
back
in
the
tank
or
somewhere
the
patrolman
said
asking
him
a
couple
of
questions
that
all
he
added
hey
listen
buddy
what
do
you
want
to
see
the
lieutenant
for
i
mean
you
ca
just
go
charging
in
to
malone
was
down
the
stairs
before
he
finished
he
went
up
to
the
desk
the
desk
sergeant
looked
down
what
it
this
time
he
said
a
track
meet
i
in
a
hurry
malone
said
where
are
the
cells
i
want
to
see
lieutenant
lynch
the
desk
sergeant
nodded
okay
he
said
but
the
lieutenant
in
any
of
the
cells
he
back
in
interrogation
with
some
kid
take
me
there
malone
said
i
show
you
anyway
the
sergeant
said
ca
leave
the
desk
on
duty
he
cleared
his
throat
and
gave
malone
a
set
of
directions
that
took
him
around
to
the
back
of
the
station
he
was
repeating
the
directions
when
malone
left
there
was
a
door
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
at
the
back
of
the
station
it
was
a
plain
wooden
door
with
the
numeral
stenciled
on
it
malone
opened
it
and
looked
inside
he
was
staring
into
a
rather
small
rather
plain
little
room
there
were
absolutely
no
bright
beam
lights
burning
and
there
did
seem
to
be
any
rubber
hoses
around
anywhere
there
were
only
four
chairs
seated
in
three
of
the
chairs
were
lieutenant
lynch
and
two
other
police
officers
in
the
fourth
chair
facing
them
was
a
young
boy
he
did
look
like
a
tough
kid
he
had
wavy
black
hair
brown
eyes
and
what
malone
thought
looked
like
a
generally
friendly
appearance
he
was
slight
and
wiry
not
over
five
feet
five
or
six
and
he
wore
an
expression
that
was
neither
too
eager
nor
hostile
it
was
just
blank
either
malone
finally
pinned
it
down
as
receptive
he
had
the
strangest
impression
that
he
had
seen
the
boy
somewhere
before
but
he
could
remember
when
or
where
lieutenant
lynch
was
talking
all
we
want
mike
is
a
little
information
we
thought
you
be
able
to
help
us
if
you
wanted
to
now
how
about
it
sure
mike
fueyo
said
his
voice
was
a
little
high
but
it
was
well
controlled
and
responsive
sure
lieutenant
i
help
if
i
can
but
i
just
do
dig
what
you
giving
me
it
does
make
sense
lynch
stirred
a
little
impatiently
and
his
voice
began
to
carry
a
new
bite
i
talking
about
cadillacs
he
said
red
cadillacs
models
it
a
nice
car
mike
said
what
do
you
know
about
them
lynch
said
know
about
them
mike
said
i
know
they
nice
cars
that
about
it
what
else
am
i
going
to
know
lieutenant
maybe
you
think
i
own
one
of
these
big
red
caddies
maybe
you
think
i
got
that
kind
of
money
well
listen
lieutenant
i
like
to
help
you
out
but
just
not
the
cadillacs
lynch
said
were
just
a
minute
lieutenant
malone
said
dead
silence
fell
with
great
suddenness
lynch
and
all
the
others
looked
around
at
malone
who
smiled
apologetically
i
do
want
to
disturb
anything
he
said
but
i
would
like
to
talk
to
mike
here
for
a
little
while
oh
lynch
said
sourly
sure
sure
i
like
to
ask
him
a
couple
of
questions
malone
said
alone
alone
lynch
said
oh
but
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
malone
knew
except
bow
to
the
inevitable
of
course
he
said
go
right
ahead
you
can
stand
outside
the
door
malone
said
he
wo
get
away
and
you
better
hold
this
malone
knowing
perfectly
well
that
staying
armed
and
alone
in
a
room
with
a
suspect
was
something
you
just
did
not
do
unstrapped
his
magnum
and
handed
it
to
the
lieutenant
he
left
reluctantly
with
his
men
the
door
closed
malone
could
understand
lynch
attitude
if
malone
solved
the
case
lynch
would
not
get
any
credit
otherwise
it
might
go
down
in
his
personal
record
and
of
course
the
nypd
would
rather
wrap
the
case
up
themselves
the
fbi
was
treated
as
a
necessary
interference
unfortunately
malone
thought
lynch
had
had
absolutely
no
choice
he
sighed
gently
and
turned
his
attention
to
mike
fueyo
who
was
still
sitting
in
his
chair
now
mike
he
began
and
was
interrupted
the
door
opened
lieutenant
lynch
said
if
you
need
us
malone
just
yell
you
hear
me
malone
promised
the
door
shut
he
turned
back
to
the
boy
now
mike
he
began
again
my
name
is
malone
and
i
with
the
fbi
in
washington
i
like
to
ask
you
a
few
gee
malone
mike
broke
in
eagerly
i
glad
you
here
really
glad
about
that
malone
said
well
i
these
cops
here
have
been
giving
me
a
pretty
rough
deal
you
know
mike
said
i
sure
they
malone
began
but
i
been
looking
for
you
mike
went
on
see
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
you
something
real
important
malone
leaned
forward
expectantly
at
last
he
was
going
to
get
some
information
perhaps
the
information
that
would
break
the
whole
case
wide
open
he
said
yes
well
mike
began
and
stopped
you
do
have
to
be
afraid
of
me
mike
malone
said
just
tell
me
whatever
on
your
mind
sure
mike
said
it
this
he
took
a
deep
breath
malone
clenched
his
fists
now
it
was
coming
now
he
would
hear
the
fact
he
waited
mike
stuck
out
his
tongue
and
blew
the
longest
loudest
brassiest
and
juiciest
bronx
cheer
that
malone
had
ever
heard
then
almost
instantly
the
room
was
empty
except
for
malone
himself
mike
was
gone
there
was
any
place
to
hide
and
there
had
been
any
time
to
hide
in
malone
looked
around
wildly
but
he
had
no
doubts
at
all
mike
fueyo
had
vanished
utterly
and
instantaneously
he
gone
out
like
a
light
thirty
seconds
passed
during
that
time
malone
did
nothing
at
all
he
just
sat
there
while
a
confused
montage
of
pictures
tumbled
through
his
head
sometimes
he
saw
double
exposures
and
sometimes
a
couple
of
pictures
overlapped
but
it
did
seem
to
make
any
difference
because
none
of
the
pictures
meant
anything
anyhow
the
reason
for
that
was
obvious
he
was
no
longer
sane
he
had
cracked
up
at
a
crucial
moment
his
brain
had
failed
him
and
now
people
would
have
to
come
in
and
cart
him
away
and
put
him
in
a
strait
jacket
it
was
perfectly
obvious
to
malone
that
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
dealing
with
everyday
life
the
blow
on
the
head
had
probably
taken
final
effect
and
it
had
been
more
serious
than
the
doctor
had
imagined
he
had
always
distrusted
doctors
anyhow
and
now
he
was
suffering
from
a
delayed
reaction
he
was
living
in
the
real
world
any
more
he
had
gone
off
to
dreamland
where
people
disappeared
when
you
looked
at
them
there
was
no
hope
for
him
any
more
it
was
a
nice
theory
and
it
was
even
comforting
in
a
way
there
was
only
one
thing
wrong
with
it
the
room
around
him
did
look
dreamlike
at
all
it
was
perfectly
solid
and
real
and
it
looked
just
the
way
it
had
looked
before
mike
fueyo
had
well
malone
amended
before
whatever
had
happened
had
happened
it
was
a
perfectly
complete
little
room
and
it
had
four
chairs
in
it
malone
was
sitting
in
one
of
the
chairs
and
all
the
others
were
empty
there
was
absolutely
nothing
else
in
the
room
with
some
regret
malone
abandoned
the
theory
that
he
had
gone
mad
this
left
him
with
no
ideas
at
all
because
if
he
had
become
insane
then
what
happened
after
another
second
or
two
some
ideas
began
to
filter
through
the
daze
perhaps
he
just
blacked
out
for
a
minute
and
the
kid
had
gone
out
the
door
that
was
possible
was
it
sure
it
was
and
maybe
he
had
just
not
seen
the
kid
go
his
eyes
had
failed
for
a
second
or
two
that
could
certainly
happen
after
a
blow
on
the
head
malone
tried
to
remember
where
the
sight
centers
of
the
brain
were
maybe
whoever
had
hit
him
had
disturbed
them
and
he
had
a
sudden
blackout
come
to
think
of
it
that
made
pretty
good
sense
he
had
blacked
out
and
mike
had
just
walked
out
the
door
it
had
to
be
the
door
of
course
the
windows
were
out
of
the
question
since
there
were
any
windows
and
ducts
do
not
provide
reasonable
space
for
an
exit
not
if
you
happen
to
be
a
human
being
that
malone
told
himself
was
settled
and
a
good
thing
too
he
had
begun
to
worry
about
it
but
now
he
knew
just
what
had
happened
and
he
felt
relieved
he
got
up
from
his
chair
walked
over
to
the
door
and
opened
it
lieutenant
lynch
nearly
fell
into
the
room
he
obviously
had
his
ear
pressed
tightly
to
the
door
and
had
expected
it
to
open
the
other
two
cops
stood
behind
him
just
about
filling
the
hallway
with
their
broad
shoulders
well
well
malone
said
lynch
recovered
his
balance
and
glared
at
the
fbi
agent
he
said
nothing
where
is
he
malone
said
where
is
he
lynch
repeated
and
blinked
where
malone
shook
his
head
impatiently
fueyo
he
said
the
kid
where
did
he
lynch
expression
was
the
same
as
that
on
the
faces
of
the
other
two
cops
complete
and
utter
bafflement
malone
stopped
and
stared
it
was
suddenly
very
obvious
that
the
lovely
theory
he
had
worked
out
for
mike
disappearance
was
true
in
the
least
if
mike
fueyo
had
come
out
the
door
then
these
cops
would
know
about
it
but
they
obviously
knew
nothing
at
all
about
it
therefore
he
had
come
out
through
the
door
malone
took
a
deep
breath
what
are
you
talking
about
lynch
said
is
the
kid
in
there
with
you
what
happened
there
was
only
one
thing
to
do
and
malone
went
ahead
and
did
it
of
course
not
he
snapped
trying
to
sound
impatient
and
official
i
released
him
you
released
him
malone
said
he
stepped
out
into
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
of
the
interrogation
room
firmly
behind
him
i
got
all
the
information
i
needed
so
i
let
him
go
thanks
lynch
said
bitterly
after
all
i
was
the
one
who
you
called
him
in
for
questioning
did
you
lieutenant
malone
said
yes
i
did
and
i
well
malone
said
i
questioned
him
there
was
a
little
silence
then
lynch
asked
in
a
strangled
voice
what
did
he
say
sorry
malone
said
at
once
that
classified
information
he
pushed
his
way
into
the
corridor
trying
to
look
as
if
he
had
fifteen
other
jobs
to
accomplish
within
the
next
hour
being
an
fbi
agent
was
going
to
help
a
little
but
he
still
had
to
look
good
in
order
to
carry
it
off
but
thanks
for
your
lieutenant
malone
said
you
all
been
very
helpful
he
smiled
at
them
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
superior
manner
so
long
he
said
and
started
walking
wait
lynch
said
he
flung
open
the
door
of
the
interrogation
room
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
was
empty
wait
malone
malone
turned
slowly
trying
to
look
calm
and
in
control
of
the
situation
yes
he
said
lynch
looked
at
him
with
puzzled
pleading
eyes
malone
did
you
release
him
we
were
right
here
he
did
come
through
the
door
there
is
any
other
exit
so
how
did
you
get
him
out
there
was
only
one
answer
to
that
and
malone
gave
it
with
a
quiet
assured
air
i
terribly
sorry
lieutenant
he
said
but
classified
information
too
he
gave
the
cops
a
little
wave
and
walked
slowly
down
the
corridor
when
he
reached
the
stairs
he
began
to
speed
up
and
he
was
out
of
the
precinct
station
and
into
a
taxicab
before
any
of
the
cops
could
have
realized
what
had
happened
he
took
a
deep
breath
feeling
as
if
it
were
the
first
he
had
in
several
days
breathe
air
he
told
himself
it
for
you
not
that
new
york
had
any
real
air
in
it
it
was
mostly
carbon
fumes
and
the
like
but
it
was
the
nearest
thing
to
air
that
malone
could
find
at
the
moment
and
he
determined
to
go
right
on
breathing
it
until
something
better
and
cleaner
showed
up
but
that
was
important
now
as
the
cab
tooled
along
down
broadway
toward
street
malone
closed
his
eyes
and
began
going
over
the
whole
thing
in
his
mind
mike
fueyo
had
vanished
of
that
malone
told
himself
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
no
probable
possible
shadow
of
doubt
no
possible
doubt
as
a
matter
of
fact
whatever
dismissing
the
grand
inquisitor
with
a
negligent
wave
of
his
hand
he
concentrated
on
the
main
question
it
was
a
good
question
malone
could
have
sat
and
pondered
it
admiringly
for
a
long
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
was
all
he
could
think
of
to
do
as
the
cab
turned
up
street
and
headed
east
he
certainly
did
have
any
answers
for
it
but
it
was
a
lovely
question
does
that
leave
kenneth
malone
and
possibly
even
more
important
was
miguel
fueyo
it
was
obvious
that
he
vanished
on
purpose
and
it
had
just
been
something
he
recently
discovered
he
had
known
all
along
that
he
could
pull
the
trick
if
he
had
known
that
he
would
have
done
what
he
had
done
beforehand
no
boy
no
matter
what
he
was
would
give
the
fbi
the
raspberry
unless
he
was
pretty
sure
he
could
get
away
with
it
malone
remembered
the
raspberry
and
winced
slightly
the
cab
driver
called
back
anything
wrong
buddy
everything
malone
said
but
do
worry
about
it
the
cab
driver
shrugged
and
turned
back
to
the
wheel
malone
went
back
to
mike
fueyo
the
kid
could
make
himself
vanish
at
will
invisibility
malone
thought
about
that
for
a
while
the
fact
that
it
was
impossible
did
decide
him
against
it
everything
was
impossible
that
much
was
clear
but
he
did
think
mike
fueyo
had
just
become
invisible
no
there
had
been
the
sense
of
presence
actually
leaving
the
room
if
mike
had
become
invisible
and
stayed
malone
was
sure
he
would
have
felt
the
boy
leave
mike
had
not
just
become
invisible
what
do
i
mean
just
malone
asked
himself
unhappily
he
had
gone
elsewhere
this
brought
him
back
full
circle
to
his
original
question
where
was
the
boy
now
but
he
ignored
it
for
a
minute
or
two
as
another
even
more
difficult
query
presented
itself
mind
malone
told
himself
something
was
bothering
him
malone
realized
that
it
had
been
bothering
him
for
a
long
time
at
last
he
managed
to
locate
it
and
hold
it
up
to
the
light
for
inspection
the
psionics
expert
at
westinghouse
had
mentioned
something
during
malone
last
conversation
with
him
who
invented
a
telepathy
detector
had
been
discussing
further
reaches
in
his
field
after
all
he
said
if
thoughts
can
bridge
any
distance
whatever
regardless
of
other
barriers
there
is
no
reason
why
matter
could
not
do
likewise
but
it
does
malone
had
said
or
at
least
it
has
so
far
there
no
way
to
be
sure
of
that
had
said
sternly
after
all
we
have
no
reports
of
it
but
that
means
little
our
search
has
only
begun
oh
malone
had
said
sure
matter
controlled
by
thought
might
bridge
distances
instantaneously
had
said
and
he
referred
to
something
some
word
that
was
it
malone
sat
back
all
you
had
to
do
he
reflected
was
to
think
yourself
somewhere
else
and
bing
you
were
there
if
malone
had
been
able
to
do
it
it
would
not
only
have
saved
him
a
lot
of
time
and
trouble
but
also
such
things
as
cab
fare
and
train
fare
and
oh
a
lot
of
different
things
but
he
could
and
had
found
anyone
else
who
could
either
as
far
as
malone
knew
nobody
could
teleport
except
mike
fueyo
the
cab
stopped
in
front
of
fbi
headquarters
you
some
kind
of
secret
agent
the
cabbie
said
like
on
of
course
not
malone
said
pleasantly
i
a
foreign
spy
oh
the
cabbie
said
sure
he
took
his
money
with
a
somewhat
puzzled
air
while
malone
crossed
the
sidewalk
and
went
into
the
building
everyone
was
active
malone
pushed
his
way
through
arguing
knots
of
men
until
he
reached
the
small
office
which
he
and
boyd
had
been
assigned
he
had
already
decided
not
to
tell
boyd
about
the
disappearing
boy
that
would
only
confuse
him
and
matters
were
confused
enough
as
they
stood
malone
had
no
proof
he
had
only
his
word
and
the
word
of
a
few
baffled
policemen
all
of
whom
were
probably
thoroughly
confused
by
now
boyd
had
a
job
to
do
and
malone
had
decided
to
let
him
go
on
doing
it
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
what
he
was
doing
when
malone
entered
the
room
he
was
sitting
at
his
desk
talking
on
the
telephone
malone
see
the
face
on
the
screen
but
boyd
was
scowling
at
it
fiercely
sure
he
said
so
some
guy
makes
a
fuss
that
what
you
there
for
but
he
wants
to
sue
the
city
a
voice
said
tinnily
or
somebody
anyhow
let
him
sue
boyd
said
we
got
authority
just
get
that
car
look
the
voice
said
i
i
do
care
now
boyd
snapped
get
it
then
hand
it
over
to
the
pickup
squad
and
say
malone
wants
this
car
immediately
know
what
to
do
got
that
sure
boyd
the
voice
said
but
i
do
never
mind
boyd
said
go
ahead
and
get
the
job
done
the
united
states
of
america
is
depending
on
you
with
one
last
scowl
he
hung
up
and
swung
around
to
face
malone
you
gave
me
a
great
job
he
said
i
really
love
it
you
know
that
it
got
to
be
done
malone
said
in
a
noncommittal
voice
how
it
going
so
far
boyd
closed
his
eyes
for
a
second
red
cadillacs
to
date
which
is
bad
i
suppose
he
said
and
six
calls
like
the
one
you
just
heard
all
from
agents
with
problems
what
i
supposed
to
do
when
a
guy
catches
a
couple
necking
in
a
red
cadillac
at
this
time
of
day
malone
said
new
york
boyd
said
and
shrugged
things
are
funny
here
malone
nodded
what
did
you
do
about
them
he
said
told
the
agent
to
take
the
car
and
give
a
pass
to
a
movie
boyd
said
good
malone
said
keep
that
sort
of
thing
in
the
dark
where
it
belongs
for
some
reason
this
reminded
him
of
dorothy
he
still
had
to
get
tickets
for
a
show
but
that
could
wait
how
about
the
assembly
line
he
said
disassembly
boyd
said
leibowitz
has
started
it
going
he
borrowed
the
use
of
a
big
auto
repair
shop
out
in
jersey
city
and
they
be
doing
a
faster
job
than
we
thought
he
paused
but
it
been
a
wonderful
day
he
said
one
to
remember
as
long
as
i
live
possibly
even
until
tomorrow
and
how
have
you
been
doing
well
malone
said
i
not
absolutely
sure
yet
that
a
nice
helpful
answer
boyd
said
in
the
best
traditions
of
the
fbi
i
ca
help
it
malone
said
it
true
well
what
the
hell
have
you
been
doing
boyd
said
drinking
helling
around
living
it
up
while
i
sit
here
and
talk
to
people
about
cadillacs
not
exactly
malone
said
i
been
well
doing
more
or
less
what
burris
told
me
to
do
nosing
around
keeping
my
eyes
open
i
think
the
phone
chimed
boyd
flipped
up
the
mike
and
eyed
the
screen
balefully
federal
bureau
of
investigation
he
said
crisply
who
the
hell
are
you
a
voice
on
the
other
end
said
what
before
the
image
on
the
screen
cleared
federal
bureau
of
investigation
boyd
said
in
a
perfectly
innocent
voice
boyd
speaking
oh
a
voice
said
it
was
a
very
calm
quiet
voice
hello
boyd
the
image
cleared
boyd
was
facing
the
picture
of
a
man
in
his
middle
thirties
a
man
with
large
gentle
brown
eyes
and
an
expression
that
somehow
managed
to
look
both
sad
and
confident
hello
leibowitz
boyd
said
is
malone
in
leibowitz
said
i
really
wanted
to
talk
to
him
sure
boyd
said
just
a
second
he
motioned
to
malone
who
came
around
and
sat
at
boyd
desk
as
boyd
got
up
he
nodded
to
leibowitz
and
the
electronics
engineer
nodded
back
how
everything
coming
dr
leibowitz
malone
said
leibowitz
shrugged
meaningfully
all
right
he
said
i
called
you
to
tell
you
about
that
by
the
way
we
managed
to
cut
the
time
down
somewhat
that
wonderful
malone
said
it
now
down
to
about
four
hours
per
car
and
that
means
we
may
be
able
to
do
even
better
than
running
one
off
the
line
every
fifteen
minutes
at
the
moment
fifteen
minutes
is
about
standard
though
with
sixteen
cars
in
the
line
sure
malone
said
but
anything
you
can
do
to
speed
it
up
i
understand
leibowitz
said
of
course
i
do
anything
that
i
can
for
you
i
have
got
a
small
preliminary
report
by
the
way
yes
the
first
car
has
just
been
run
off
the
assembly
line
leibowitz
said
and
i
afraid
malone
that
there
nothing
odd
about
it
at
all
well
malone
said
we
ca
expect
to
hit
the
jackpot
with
our
first
try
certainly
not
leibowitz
said
but
the
second
should
be
off
soon
and
then
the
rest
i
keeping
my
eye
on
every
one
of
course
fine
malone
said
and
meant
it
leibowitz
was
the
kind
of
man
who
inspired
instant
and
complete
trust
malone
was
perfectly
sure
he
do
the
job
he
had
started
to
do
then
an
idea
struck
him
has
the
first
car
been
reassembled
yet
he
asked
of
course
leibowitz
said
we
took
that
step
into
account
in
our
timing
what
would
you
like
done
with
it
and
with
the
other
ones
as
they
come
off
unless
you
can
find
something
odd
about
a
car
just
return
it
to
its
owner
malone
said
or
pass
the
problem
on
to
the
squad
men
take
care
of
it
he
paused
if
you
do
find
something
odd
i
call
you
at
once
of
course
leibowitz
said
good
malone
said
incidentally
i
did
want
to
ask
you
something
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
doubting
your
work
or
anything
like
that
believe
me
i
sure
you
not
leibowitz
said
but
malone
said
why
does
it
take
so
long
i
think
it
would
be
fairly
easy
to
spot
a
robotic
or
a
brain
capable
of
controlling
a
car
it
might
have
been
once
leibowitz
said
but
these
days
the
problems
are
rather
special
oh
i
do
mean
we
ca
do
it
we
can
and
we
will
but
with
subminiaturization
malone
and
semipsionic
circuits
a
pretty
good
brain
can
be
hidden
beneath
a
coat
of
paint
for
no
reason
at
all
malone
suddenly
thought
of
dorothy
again
a
coat
of
paint
he
said
in
a
disturbed
tone
certainly
leibowitz
said
and
smiled
at
him
it
was
a
warm
smile
that
had
little
or
nothing
to
do
with
the
problem
they
were
talking
about
but
malone
liked
it
it
made
him
feel
as
if
leibowitz
liked
him
and
approved
of
him
he
grinned
back
but
a
coat
of
paint
is
very
much
malone
said
it
does
have
to
be
very
much
leibowitz
said
not
these
days
i
often
told
emily
that
my
wife
malone
that
i
could
hide
a
tv
circuit
under
her
lipstick
not
that
there
would
be
any
use
in
it
but
the
techniques
are
there
malone
and
if
your
conjecture
is
correct
someone
is
using
them
oh
malone
said
sure
but
you
find
the
circuits
if
there
leibowitz
nodded
slowly
we
can
malone
he
said
they
betray
themselves
a
microcircuit
need
not
be
more
than
a
few
microns
thick
you
see
as
far
as
the
conductors
and
insulators
are
concerned
at
any
rate
but
the
and
such
have
to
be
as
big
as
a
pinhead
enormous
huh
malone
said
well
leibowitz
said
and
chuckled
quite
large
enough
to
locate
without
trouble
at
any
rate
they
very
hard
to
conceal
and
the
leads
from
the
brain
to
the
power
controls
are
even
easier
to
find
comparatively
speaking
of
course
of
course
malone
said
all
the
brain
does
you
see
leibowitz
said
is
control
the
mechanism
that
steers
the
car
but
it
takes
real
power
to
steer
a
great
deal
more
than
it
does
to
compute
the
steering
i
see
malone
who
did
said
desperately
in
other
words
unless
something
radically
new
has
been
developed
you
can
find
the
circuits
right
leibowitz
said
grinning
it
would
have
to
be
something
very
new
indeed
malone
we
up
on
most
of
the
latest
developments
here
we
got
to
be
but
i
do
want
you
giving
me
the
credit
for
this
no
malone
said
oh
no
leibowitz
said
all
i
do
is
work
out
the
general
application
to
theory
as
far
as
actual
detection
is
concerned
my
partner
hardin
who
takes
care
of
all
the
engineering
details
malone
said
well
so
long
as
one
of
you
sal
a
real
crackerjack
leibowitz
said
enthusiastically
he
had
an
intuitive
feel
about
these
things
it
really
amazing
to
watch
him
go
to
work
it
must
be
malone
said
politely
oh
it
really
is
leibowitz
said
and
it
because
of
sal
that
i
can
make
the
guarantee
i
do
make
that
if
there
are
any
unusual
circuits
in
those
cars
we
can
find
them
thanks
malone
said
i
sure
you
do
the
job
and
we
need
that
information
do
bother
to
send
along
a
detailed
report
though
unless
you
find
something
out
of
the
ordinary
of
course
malone
leibowitz
said
i
would
have
bothered
you
except
for
the
production
here
i
understand
malone
said
it
perfectly
all
right
i
be
hearing
from
you
then
certainly
malone
leibowitz
said
malone
cut
the
circuit
at
once
and
started
to
turn
away
but
he
never
got
the
chance
it
started
to
chime
again
at
once
federal
bureau
of
investigation
malone
said
as
he
flipped
up
the
receiver
he
wanted
badly
to
copy
boyd
salutation
but
he
found
that
he
just
did
have
the
gall
to
do
it
and
said
sadly
instead
malone
speaking
there
was
no
immediate
answer
from
the
other
party
instead
the
screen
slowly
cleared
showing
malone
the
picture
of
a
woman
he
recognized
instantly
it
was
juanita
fueyo
mike
mother
malone
stared
at
her
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
a
couple
of
hours
passed
while
he
tried
to
find
his
voice
of
course
she
looked
up
the
fbi
number
in
the
phone
book
and
found
him
that
way
but
she
was
about
the
last
person
on
earth
from
whom
he
expected
a
call
oh
malone
she
said
thank
you
so
much
you
got
my
mike
back
from
the
police
malone
gulped
i
did
he
said
well
i
but
malone
you
must
help
me
again
because
now
my
mike
says
he
must
not
stay
at
home
he
is
leaving
he
is
leaving
right
away
leaving
malone
said
he
thought
of
a
thousand
things
to
do
he
could
send
a
squad
of
men
to
arrest
mike
and
mike
could
disappear
while
they
were
trying
to
get
hold
of
him
he
could
go
down
himself
and
be
greeted
if
he
knew
mike
fueyo
with
another
giant
raspberry
he
could
try
to
plead
with
mike
on
the
phone
and
what
good
would
that
do
so
instead
he
just
sat
and
stared
while
fueyo
went
right
on
he
says
he
will
send
me
money
but
money
is
nothing
compared
to
my
own
boy
my
own
mike
he
says
he
must
go
away
malone
but
i
know
you
can
stop
him
i
know
it
sure
malone
said
but
i
oh
i
knew
that
you
would
fueyo
shrieked
she
almost
came
through
the
screen
at
him
you
are
a
great
man
malone
i
will
say
many
prayers
for
you
every
day
i
will
pray
for
you
in
all
your
work
i
will
never
stop
praying
for
you
because
you
help
me
her
voice
and
face
changed
abruptly
excuse
me
now
she
said
i
must
go
back
to
work
well
malone
said
if
i
then
she
turned
back
and
beamed
at
him
again
oh
thank
you
malone
thank
you
with
the
thanks
of
a
mother
bring
my
boy
back
to
me
and
the
image
faded
and
died
boyd
tapped
malone
on
the
shoulder
i
did
know
you
were
involved
in
an
advice
column
for
the
lovelorn
he
said
i
not
malone
said
sourly
boyd
sighed
i
bite
he
said
who
was
that
malone
thought
of
several
possible
answers
and
finally
chose
one
that
he
said
was
my
she
worries
about
me
every
time
i
go
out
on
a
job
with
you
very
funny
boyd
said
i
am
screaming
with
laughter
just
get
back
to
work
malone
said
and
leave
everything
to
me
he
hoped
he
sounded
more
confident
than
he
felt
lighting
a
cigarette
and
wishing
he
were
alone
in
his
own
room
so
that
he
could
smoke
a
cigar
and
not
have
to
worry
about
looking
dashing
and
alert
malone
strolled
out
of
the
office
with
a
final
wave
to
boyd
he
was
thinking
about
mike
fueyo
and
he
stopped
his
chain
of
reasoning
just
long
enough
to
look
in
at
the
office
of
the
and
ask
him
to
pry
loose
two
tickets
for
hot
for
that
night
my
god
the
agent
said
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
who
looked
as
if
he
suffered
from
chronic
stomach
trouble
you
must
be
crazy
are
they
all
like
that
in
washington
no
malone
said
cheerfully
some
of
them
are
pretty
normal
this
one
man
napoleon
we
call
him
who
keeps
insisting
that
he
should
have
won
the
battle
of
waterloo
but
otherwise
he
perfectly
fine
he
flicked
his
cigarette
in
the
air
and
left
grinning
five
steps
away
the
grin
disappeared
and
a
frown
took
its
place
he
walked
along
street
to
park
avenue
without
noticing
where
he
was
going
luckily
the
streets
were
really
crowded
and
malone
only
had
to
apologize
twice
once
for
stepping
on
a
man
toe
and
once
for
absently
toeing
a
woman
dog
when
he
reached
the
corner
he
headed
downtown
humming
under
his
breath
and
trying
to
figure
out
his
next
move
he
needed
more
than
one
move
he
needed
a
whole
series
of
moves
this
was
not
the
usual
kind
of
case
burris
had
called
it
a
vacation
and
in
one
way
malone
supposed
burris
was
perfectly
right
for
once
there
was
no
question
about
who
had
committed
the
crimes
it
was
obvious
by
now
that
mike
fueyo
and
his
silent
spooks
had
been
stealing
the
cadillacs
it
was
even
obvious
that
mike
or
someone
with
mike
talent
had
bopped
him
on
the
head
and
taken
the
red
cadillac
he
had
been
examining
and
the
same
gang
probably
accounted
for
the
sergeant
jukovsky
affair
too
or
at
least
it
was
reasonable
to
assume
that
they
did
malone
thought
he
could
see
how
it
had
worked
one
of
the
silent
spooks
was
a
lot
smaller
than
a
grown
man
and
the
two
cops
who
had
seen
anyone
in
the
parked
car
just
had
been
able
to
catch
sight
of
the
undersized
driver
of
course
there
been
someone
in
the
car
when
it
had
been
driving
along
the
west
side
highway
someone
who
had
teleported
himself
right
out
of
the
car
when
it
had
gone
over
the
embankment
that
of
course
meant
that
there
would
be
no
secret
machines
found
in
the
red
cadillacs
leibowitz
and
hardin
were
examining
now
but
malone
had
already
decided
to
let
that
phase
of
things
go
on
first
of
all
it
was
always
possible
that
he
was
wrong
and
that
some
such
machine
really
did
exist
second
even
if
they
did
find
a
machine
they
might
find
something
else
almost
anything
he
thought
might
turn
up
and
third
it
kept
boyd
decently
busy
and
out
of
malone
hair
that
had
been
an
easy
solution
and
malone
thought
the
problem
of
who
had
been
taking
the
red
cadillacs
looked
just
as
easy
now
if
his
answers
were
right
and
he
was
reasonably
sure
of
that
unfortunately
he
was
now
left
with
a
new
and
unusual
question
do
you
catch
a
teleport
malone
looked
up
jarred
to
a
stop
by
a
man
built
like
a
brown
bear
with
a
chunky
body
and
an
oval
slightly
sloping
head
and
face
he
had
very
short
brown
hair
shot
through
with
gray
and
gave
malone
a
small
inquisitive
stare
and
looked
away
without
a
word
malone
mumbled
sorry
and
looked
up
at
the
street
sign
he
was
at
street
and
park
avenue
he
jerked
a
hand
up
to
his
face
and
managed
to
hook
the
chunky
man
by
the
suit
it
fell
away
exposing
the
initials
carefully
worked
into
his
shirt
second
mistake
malone
thought
wildly
muttered
sorry
again
and
turned
west
feeling
fairly
grateful
to
the
unfortunate
bystander
he
had
reminded
malone
of
one
thing
if
he
wanted
to
get
even
a
part
of
his
plan
past
the
stage
he
had
to
make
a
call
in
a
hurry
he
found
a
phone
booth
in
a
bar
called
the
ad
lib
at
madison
avenue
sternly
telling
himself
that
he
was
stopping
there
to
make
a
phone
call
a
business
phone
call
and
not
to
have
a
drink
he
marched
right
past
the
friendly
bartender
and
went
into
the
phone
booth
where
he
made
a
call
to
new
york
police
commissioner
john
henry
fernack
fernack
face
was
that
of
an
old
man
but
there
was
no
telling
how
old
the
early
seventies
was
one
guess
malone
imagined
the
late
fifties
might
be
another
he
looked
tough
as
if
he
had
spent
all
of
his
life
trying
to
persuade
other
people
that
he
was
young
enough
for
the
handball
tournament
when
he
saw
malone
his
eyebrows
lifted
slightly
but
he
did
say
anything
commissioner
malone
said
i
called
to
ask
you
to
do
me
a
favor
there
was
caution
hidden
in
the
calm
and
quiet
voice
well
fernack
said
what
is
it
malone
can
you
have
all
the
robberies
for
a
given
period
run
through
the
computer
malone
said
i
need
some
dope
depends
on
the
given
period
fernack
said
i
ca
do
it
for
what
would
i
need
data
on
robberies
in
for
malone
said
honestly
interested
i
never
question
the
fbi
fernack
said
soberly
but
what
dates
do
you
want
the
past
year
maybe
the
past
year
and
a
half
and
what
data
i
want
every
reported
crime
that
has
been
solved
malone
said
and
which
seems
to
have
been
committed
by
some
impossible
means
a
safe
that
was
robbed
without
being
opened
for
instance
that
the
kind
of
thing
i
mean
every
unsolved
crime
fernack
said
now
hold
your
horses
malone
i
not
at
all
sure
that
do
worry
about
a
thing
commissioner
malone
said
this
is
confidential
you
know
how
i
feel
about
this
if
word
ever
got
out
to
i
said
confidential
john
henry
malone
said
trying
to
sound
friendly
and
trustworthy
after
all
every
place
has
unsolved
crimes
even
the
fbi
is
absolutely
perfect
oh
fernack
said
sure
but
confidential
malone
you
have
my
word
malone
said
sincerely
fernack
said
well
how
fast
can
you
get
me
the
dope
malone
said
i
do
exactly
know
fernack
said
the
last
time
anything
even
remotely
like
this
was
run
through
departmental
survey
but
you
would
be
interested
it
took
something
like
eight
hours
fine
malone
said
eight
hours
then
i
look
everything
over
and
if
we
need
a
second
it
wo
take
too
long
i
let
you
know
as
soon
as
i
can
about
that
he
grinned
into
the
phone
fernack
cleared
his
throat
and
asked
delicately
mind
telling
me
what
all
this
is
for
malone
offered
up
a
little
prayer
before
answering
and
when
he
did
answer
it
was
in
his
softest
and
friendliest
tones
i
rather
not
say
just
now
john
henry
but
malone
fernack
voice
sounded
a
little
strained
and
his
jaw
set
just
a
trifle
if
you
malone
knew
perfectly
well
how
fernack
reacted
when
he
did
get
a
bit
of
information
he
wanted
and
this
was
no
time
to
set
off
any
fireworks
in
the
commissioner
office
look
john
henry
he
said
gently
i
tell
you
as
soon
as
i
can
honest
but
this
is
classified
information
it
not
my
fault
fernack
said
but
and
apparently
realized
that
argument
was
not
going
to
do
him
any
good
all
right
malone
he
said
at
last
have
it
for
you
as
soon
as
possible
great
malone
said
then
i
see
you
later
sure
fernack
said
he
paused
as
if
he
were
about
to
open
the
controversy
just
once
more
but
all
he
said
was
so
long
malone
malone
breathed
a
great
sigh
of
relief
and
flipped
the
phone
off
he
stepped
out
of
the
booth
feeling
so
proud
of
himself
that
he
could
barely
walk
not
only
had
he
managed
to
calm
down
commissioner
fernack
he
had
also
walked
right
past
a
bar
on
the
way
to
the
phone
he
had
performed
several
acts
he
felt
above
and
beyond
the
call
of
duty
and
he
told
himself
that
he
deserved
a
reward
happily
the
reward
was
convenient
to
hand
he
went
to
the
bar
and
beckoned
the
bartender
over
to
him
bourbon
and
soda
he
said
and
a
medal
if
possible
a
what
the
bartender
said
a
medal
malone
said
for
conduct
beyond
reproach
the
bartender
nodded
sadly
maybe
you
just
ought
to
go
home
mac
he
said
sleep
it
off
for
a
while
new
yorkers
malone
decided
as
the
bartender
went
off
to
get
his
drink
had
no
sense
of
humor
back
in
chicago
where
he
been
more
or
less
weaned
on
gin
and
discovered
that
unlike
his
father
he
much
care
for
the
stuff
and
even
in
washington
people
did
go
around
accusing
you
of
drunkenness
just
because
you
made
some
harmless
little
pleasantry
oh
well
malone
drank
his
drink
and
went
out
into
the
afternoon
sunlight
he
considered
the
itinerary
of
the
magical
miguel
fueyo
he
had
gone
straight
home
from
the
police
station
apparently
and
had
then
told
his
mother
that
he
was
going
to
leave
home
but
he
had
promised
to
send
her
money
of
course
money
was
easy
for
mike
to
get
with
a
shudder
malone
thought
he
was
beginning
to
realize
just
easy
houdini
had
once
boasted
that
no
bank
vault
could
hold
him
in
mike
fueyo
case
that
was
just
doubly
true
the
vault
could
neither
hold
him
out
nor
keep
him
in
but
he
was
going
to
leave
home
malone
said
hmm
to
himself
cleared
his
throat
and
tried
it
again
by
now
he
was
at
the
corner
of
the
block
where
he
nearly
collided
with
a
workman
who
was
busily
stowing
away
a
gigantic
ladder
a
pot
of
paint
and
a
brush
malone
looked
at
the
street
sign
where
the
words
of
the
had
been
painted
out
and
in
they
finally
give
in
the
painter
told
him
but
do
you
think
they
buy
new
signs
nah
cheap
that
all
they
are
cheap
as
pretzels
he
gave
malone
a
friendly
push
with
one
end
of
the
ladder
and
disappeared
into
the
crowd
malone
did
have
the
faintest
idea
of
what
he
was
talking
about
and
how
cheap
could
a
pretzel
be
anyhow
malone
did
remember
ever
having
seen
an
especially
one
new
york
he
decided
for
the
fifteenth
time
was
a
strange
place
he
walked
downtown
for
a
block
still
thinking
about
mike
fueyo
and
absently
turned
west
again
between
sixth
and
seventh
he
had
another
attack
of
brilliance
and
began
looking
for
another
phone
booth
he
found
one
in
a
mexican
bar
named
the
xochitl
across
the
street
from
the
church
of
saint
mary
the
virgin
it
was
a
coincidence
that
he
had
landed
in
another
bar
he
told
himself
hopefully
but
he
quite
believe
it
to
prove
it
to
himself
he
headed
straight
for
the
phone
booths
again
and
put
in
his
call
ignoring
the
blandishments
of
several
rows
of
sparkling
bottles
which
he
passed
on
the
way
he
dialed
the
number
of
lieutenant
lynch
precinct
and
then
found
himself
connected
with
a
new
desk
sergeant
i
malone
he
said
i
want
to
talk
to
lynch
glad
to
know
you
malone
the
desk
sergeant
said
pleasantly
only
lynch
does
want
to
subscribe
to
the
irish
damn
it
malone
said
i
the
fbi
he
showed
his
badge
the
desk
sergeant
took
a
good
long
look
at
it
maybe
you
are
and
maybe
you
are
he
said
at
last
does
the
lieutenant
know
you
we
were
kids
together
malone
said
we
brothers
siamese
twins
put
him
on
the
phone
wait
a
minute
said
the
desk
sergeant
i
check
the
screen
went
blank
for
two
agonizing
minutes
before
it
cleared
again
to
show
lynch
face
hello
malone
lynch
said
formally
have
you
found
some
new
little
trick
to
show
up
poor
stupid
policemen
like
say
making
yourself
vanish
i
make
the
whole
damn
police
force
vanish
malone
said
in
a
couple
of
minutes
i
called
to
ask
a
favor
anything
lynch
said
anything
within
my
poor
power
whatever
i
have
is
yours
whither
thou
goest
knock
it
off
malone
said
and
then
grinned
after
all
there
was
no
sense
in
making
an
enemy
out
of
lynch
lynch
blinked
took
a
deep
breath
and
said
in
an
entirely
different
voice
okay
malone
what
the
favor
do
you
still
have
that
list
of
silent
spooks
malone
said
sure
i
do
lynch
said
why
i
gave
you
a
copy
of
it
i
ca
do
this
job
malone
said
you
have
yes
sir
lynch
said
and
saluted
just
listen
malone
said
i
want
you
to
check
up
on
every
kid
on
that
list
and
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
when
we
find
them
lynch
said
that
the
trouble
malone
said
you
wo
and
why
not
i
lay
you
ten
to
one
malone
said
that
every
one
of
them

skipped

without

a
forwarding
address
lynch
nodded
slowly
ten
to
one
he
said

to
make
that
a
money
bet
or

the
fbi
frown
on
gambling
ten
dollars

his
head

anxiety

said

malone
said

gave
malone
the
number
and
then
added
whatever

use
this
time
ca

malone
said
well

about

later
lynch
said
farewell
old
pal
flights
of
angels
malone
said
sing
thee
to
thy
rest
malone
replaced
the
microphone
and
headed
for
the
door
halfway
there
however
he
stopped
he
had
had
any
tequila
in
a
long
time
and
he
thought
he
owed
it
to
himself
he
felt
he
had
come
out
ahead
in
his
exchange
with
lynch
and
another
medal
was
in
order
only
a
small
one
though
he
told
himself
that
he
would
order
one
tequila
and
quit
besides
he
had
to
meet
dorothy
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
tall
bar
stools
the
bartender
bustled
over
and
eyed
him
speculatively
tequila
con
limon
he
said
negligently
ah
the
bartender
said
si
señor
malone
waited
with
impatience
at
last
it
arrived
malone
took
the
small
glass
of
tequila
in
his
right
hand
with
the
slice
of
lemon
held
firmly
between
the
index
and
middle
fingers
of
the
same
hand
the
rind
facing
in
toward
the
glass
on
the
web
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
his
left
hand
he
had
sprinkled
a
little
salt
moving
adroitly
and
with
dispatch
he
downed
the
tequila
licked
off
the
salt
and
bit
his
teeth
into
the
lemon
slice
it
felt
better
than
good
it
felt
wonderful
he
had
had
such
a
good
time
in
years
he
had
three
more
before
he
left
the
xochitl
then
noticing
the
time
he
moved
in
a
hurry
and
got
out
of
the
bar
before
temptation
overcame
him
and
he
started
ordering
still
more
it
was
nearly
six
and
he
had
to
meet
dorothy
at
topp
he
hoped
he
could
find
it
he
headed
downtown
toward
street
turned
right
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
big
red
sign
it
said
topp
malone
beamed
his
approval
at
it
it
was
just
where
it
ought
to
be
and
he
was
grateful
he
pushed
open
the
glass
door
of
the
place
and
went
in
the
maître
was
a
chunky
man
with
a
pleasant
face
a
receding
hairline
and
some
distance
back
on
his
head
dark
curly
hair
he
beamed
at
malone
as
if
the
fbi
agent
were
a
brother
table
for
one
sir
he
said
no
malone
said
peering
into
the
place
it
was
much
bigger
than
he
had
expected
no
he
said
again
i
guess
i
just
have
a
drink
at
the
bar
the
maître
d
smiled
and
bowed
him
to
a
bar
stool
malone
sat
down
and
looked
the
place
over
again
his
first
glance
had
shown
him
that
dorothy
was
there
yet
but
he
saw
no
harm
in
making
sure
be
careful
of
your
he
admonished
himself
a
little
fuzzily
there
were
a
lot
of
women
in
the
place
but
they
were
all
with
escorts
some
of
them
had
two
escorts
and
malone
wondered
about
them
were
they
drunk
or
was
he
it
was
obvious
that
someone
was
seeing
double
but
malone
was
quite
sure
who
he
stared
at
his
face
in
the
bar
mirror
for
a
few
seconds
and
ordered
a
bourbon
and
soda
when
a
bartender
came
over
and
occluded
the
image
the
bartender
went
away
and
malone
went
on
studying
himself
he
was
bad
looking
for
an
fbi
agent
he
was
taller
than
his
father
anyway
and
less
heavily
built
that
was
one
good
thing
as
a
matter
of
fact
malone
told
himself
he
was
really
a
pretty
guy
so
why
did
women
keep
him
waiting
he
heard
her
voice
before
he
saw
her
but
she
was
talking
to
him
hello
milty
she
said
how
everything
malone
turned
around
to
get
a
look
at
milty
he
turned
out
to
be
the
maître
d
what
did
he
have
that
malone
did
have
the
agent
asked
himself
sourly
obviously
dorothy
was
captivated
by
his
charm
well
that
showed
him
what
city
girls
were
like
butterflies
social
butterflies
flitting
hither
and
yon
with
the
wind
now
attracted
to
this
man
now
to
that
once
malone
told
himself
sadly
he
had
known
this
beautiful
woman
now
she
belonged
to
someone
else
he
felt
a
little
bit
sad
about
it
but
he
told
himself
to
buck
up
and
learn
to
live
with
his
tragedy
he
drank
some
more
of
his
bourbon
and
soda
and
then
she
noticed
him
he
heard
her
say
oh
excuse
me
milty
there
my
man
she
came
over
and
sat
down
next
to
him
he
wanted
to
ignore
her
just
to
teach
her
a
lesson
but
he
had
already
turned
around
and
smiled
at
her
and
she
smiled
back
hi
she
said
did
you
get
the
tickets
malone
knew
there
was
something
he
forgotten
and
now
he
knew
what
it
was
oh
he
said
sure
just
a
second
i
got
to
check
up
check
up
friend
of
mine
malone
improvised
hurriedly
bringing
them
he
gave
dorothy
a
big
smile
and
climbed
down
off
the
bar
stool
he
managed
to
find
a
phone
booth
and
dialed
fbi
headquarters
on
street
and
blessed
several
saints
when
he
found
that
the
was
still
there
tickets
malone
said
the
blinked
at
him
what
tickets
he
said
the
tickets
malone
said
did
you
get
i
got
the
said
sourly
had
to
chase
all
over
town
and
pull
more
wires
than
there
are
on
a
grand
piano
but
they
turned
up
brother
two
seats
do
you
know
what
a
job
like
that
entails
i
grateful
malone
said
i
hysterical
with
gratitude
i
rather
track
down
a
gang
of
fingerless
men
than
go
through
that
again
the
said
he
looked
as
if
his
stomach
trouble
had
suddenly
gotten
a
great
deal
worse
malone
thought
that
the
was
considering
calling
a
doctor
and
would
probably
decide
to
make
it
the
undertaker
instead
and
save
the
price
of
a
call
i
ca
express
my
gratitude
malone
told
him
where
are
they
where
do
i
pick
them
up
box
office
the
said
sourly
i
tell
you
everybody
in
washington
must
be
nuts
the
things
i
have
to
go
through
thanks
malone
said
thanks
a
lot
thanks
a
million
if
ever
anything
i
can
do
for
you
let
me
know
and
i
do
it
he
hung
up
and
went
back
to
the
bar
walking
very
carefully
well
dorothy
said
where
do
we
go
tonight
joe
stand
or
a
revival
of
wild
in
a
loft
on
bleecker
street
there
was
pride
in
malone
manner
as
he
stood
there
on
his
feet
there
was
just
a
touch
of
hauteur
as
he
said
we
see
and
he
was
repaid
for
all
of
the
efforts
eyes
went
wide
with
appreciation
and
awe
my
goodness
she
said
a
man
of
his
word
and
what
a
tough
word
too
malone
i
congratulate
you
nothing
malone
said
a
mere
absolute
nothing
nothing
the
man
says
dorothy
muttered
my
goodness
and
modest
too
tell
me
how
do
you
do
mr
malone
me
malone
said
very
well
so
far
he
finished
his
drink
and
you
i
work
at
it
she
said
cryptically
may
i
have
another
drink
malone
gave
her
a
grin
another
he
said
have
two
have
a
dozen
and
what
she
said
would
i
do
with
a
dozen
drinks
do
answer
i
think
i
can
guess
but
let
just
take
them
one
at
a
time
okay
she
signaled
to
the
bartender
wally
i
have
a
martini
and
malone
will
have
whatever
it
is
he
has
i
imagine
bourbon
and
soda
malone
said
and
gave
the
bartender
a
grin
too
just
to
make
sure
he
did
feel
left
out
the
sun
was
shining
although
it
was
evening
outside
and
the
birds
were
singing
although
malone
reflected
catching
a
bird
on
street
and
broadway
might
take
a
bit
of
doing
and
all
was
well
with
the
world
there
was
only
a
tiny
nagging
disturbing
thought
in
his
mind
it
had
to
do
with
mike
fueyo
and
the
silent
spooks
and
a
lot
of
red
cadillacs
but
he
pushed
it
resolutely
away
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
evening
he
was
about
to
spend
nothing
at
all
after
all
this
supposed
to
be
a
vacation
was
it
well
malone
dorothy
said
when
the
drinks
had
arrived
very
well
indeed
malone
said
raising
his
and
just
call
me
ken
did
i
tell
you
that
once
before
you
did
she
said
and
i
asked
you
to
call
me
dorothy
not
dotty
try
and
remember
that
i
will
remember
it
malone
said
just
as
long
as
ever
i
live
you
do
look
the
least
bit
dotty
anyhow
which
is
probably
more
than
anybody
could
say
for
me
he
started
to
look
at
himself
in
the
bar
mirror
again
and
decided
not
to
by
the
way
he
added
as
a
sudden
thought
struck
him
dotty
what
now
she
said
there
you
go
doing
it
doing
what
calling
me
that
name
oh
malone
said
make
it
dorothy
dorothy
what
he
blinked
i
mean
i
know
you
got
a
last
name
dorothy
something
only
it
probably
is
something
what
is
it
francis
she
said
obligingly
dorothy
francis
my
middle
name
is
something
in
case
you
ever
want
to
call
me
by
my
middle
name
just
yell
something
and
i
come
unless
i
have
something
else
to
do
in
which
case
everything
will
be
very
simple
i
wo
come
ah
malone
said
doubtfully
and
what
do
what
do
i
do
she
said
a
standard
question
number
two
of
a
series
i
do
modeling
photographic
modeling
and
that
not
all
i
also
do
commercials
on
if
i
look
familiar
to
you
it
probably
because
you
seen
me
on
do
i
look
familiar
to
you
i
never
watch
malone
said
crestfallen
fine
dorothy
said
unexpectedly
you
have
excellent
taste
well
malone
said
it
just
that
i
never
seem
to
get
the
time
do
apologize
for
it
dorothy
said
i
have
to
appear
on
it
but
i
do
have
to
like
it
and
now
that
i
answered
your
questions
how
about
answering
some
of
mine
gladly
malone
said
the
inmost
secrets
of
the
fbi
are
yours
for
the
asking
hmm
dorothy
said
slowly
what
do
you
do
as
an
fbi
agent
anyhow
dig
up
spies
oh
no
malone
said
we
got
enough
trouble
with
the
live
ones
we
do
go
around
digging
anybody
up
believe
me
he
paused
feeling
dimly
that
the
conversation
was
beginning
to
get
out
of
control
have
i
told
you
that
you
are
the
most
beautiful
woman
i
ever
met
he
said
at
last
no
dorothy
said
not
yet
anyway
but
i
was
expecting
it
you
were
malone
said
disappointed
certainly
dorothy
said
you
been
drinking
as
a
matter
of
fact
you
managed
to
get
quite
a
head
start
malone
hung
his
head
guiltily
true
he
said
in
a
low
voice
too
true
much
too
true
dorothy
nodded
downed
her
drink
and
waved
to
the
bartender
wally
bring
me
a
double
this
time
a
double
sure
dorothy
said
i
got
to
do
some
fast
on
malone
here
call
me
ken
malone
muttered
do
be
silly
dorothy
told
him
wally
hardly
knows
you
call
you
malone
and
like
it
the
bartender
went
away
and
malone
sat
on
his
stool
and
thought
busily
for
a
minute
at
last
he
said
if
you
really
want
to
catch
up
with
me
yes
dorothy
said
better
have
a
triple
malone
muttered
dorothy
eyebrows
rose
slightly
because
i
intend
to
have
another
one
malone
added
and
even
then
you
be
just
a
little
behind
that
sounds
sort
of
sad
in
a
way
dorothy
said
just
a
little
behind
tell
me
is
that
a
compliment
or
an
insult
both
malone
said
instantly
and
an
observation
too
dorothy
nodded
i
can
see
why
you
a
federal
cop
she
said
really
malone
said
i
did
know
it
showed
why
you
good
at
observing
she
said
like
this
morning
for
instance
ah
malone
said
he
searched
in
his
mind
for
a
quotation
and
found
it
if
thine
eye
offend
thee
pluck
it
out
and
cast
it
from
thee
he
said
triumphantly
sounds
sort
of
grisly
dorothy
said
malone
shrugged
i
ca
help
it
he
said
that
what
it
says
well
dorothy
said
did
you
did
i
what
pluck
your
eye
out
and
cast
it
from
you
did
have
to
malone
said
mine
eye
did
not
offend
me
he
blinked
and
added
far
from
it
i
guess
we
just
have
to
leave
it
unplucked
dorothy
said
sadly
it
did
offend
me
either
good
malone
said
and
the
bartender
brought
drinks
malone
picked
his
up
and
held
it
in
the
air
i
propose
a
toast
he
said
dorothy
picked
up
her
glass
a
toast
an
old
german
toast
as
a
matter
of
fact
malone
said
he
fell
silent
after
a
few
seconds
dorothy
said
well
go
ahead
zwieback
malone
said
bowed
carefully
to
dorothy
and
drained
his
glass
with
a
flourish
it
started
a
million
years
ago
in
that
distant
past
a
handful
of
photons
deep
in
the
interior
of
sol
began
their
random
journey
to
the
photosphere
they
had
been
born
as
ultrahard
gamma
radiation
and
they
were
positively
bursting
with
energy
attempting
to
push
their
respective
ways
through
the
dense
nucleonic
gas
that
had
been
their
womb
within
millimicroseconds
they
had
been
swallowed
up
by
the
various
particles
surrounding
them
swallowed
and
emitted
again
as
the
particles
met
in
violent
collision
and
then
the
process
was
repeated
after
a
thousand
thousand
years
and
billions
on
billions
of
such
repetitions
the
handful
of
photons
reached
the
relatively
cool
photosphere
of
the
sun
but
the
long
battle
had
taken
some
of
the
drive
out
of
them
over
the
past
million
years
even
the
strongest
had
become
only
hard
ultraviolet
and
the
weakest
just
sputtered
out
in
the
form
of
long
radio
waves
but
now
at
last
they
were
free
and
in
the
first
flush
of
this
newfound
freedom
they
flung
themselves
over
million
miles
of
space
traveling
at
one
hundred
and
thousand
miles
a
second
and
making
the
entire
trip
in
less
than
eight
and
minutes
they
struck
the
earth
ionosphere
and
their
numbers
diminished
the
hard
ultraviolet
was
gobbled
up
by
ozone
much
of
the
blue
was
scattered
through
the
atmosphere
the
remainder
bore
steadily
onward
down
through
the
air
they
came
only
slightly
weakened
this
time
they
hit
the
glass
of
a
window
in
the
hotel
new
yorker
losing
more
of
their
members
in
the
plunge
and
a
few
feet
from
the
glass
they
ended
their
epic
by
illuminating
a
face
the
face
responded
to
them
with
something
less
than
pleasure
it
was
clear
that
the
face
did
not
like
being
illuminated
the
light
was
very
bright
much
too
bright
it
seemed
to
be
searing
its
way
through
the
face
closed
eyelids
right
past
the
optic
nerves
into
the
itself
the
face
twisted
in
a
sudden
spasm
as
if
its
brain
were
shriveling
with
heat
its
owner
thoughtfully
turned
over
and
the
face
sought
the
seclusion
and
comparative
darkness
of
a
pillow
unfortunately
the
motion
brought
the
face
owner
to
complete
wakefulness
he
did
not
want
to
be
awake
but
he
had
very
little
choice
in
the
matter
even
though
his
face
was
no
longer
being
illuminated
he
could
feel
other
rays
of
sunlight
eating
at
the
back
of
his
head
he
put
the
pillow
over
his
head
and
felt
more
comfortable
for
a
space
but
this
slight
relief
passed
too
he
thought
about
mausoleums
mausoleums
were
nice
cool
dark
places
where
there
was
never
any
sun
or
heat
and
never
any
reason
to
wake
up
maybe
he
told
himself
cunningly
if
he
went
to
sleep
again
he
would
wake
up
dead
in
a
mausoleum
that
he
thought
would
be
nice
death
was
nice
and
pleasant
unfortunately
he
realized
he
was
not
dead
and
there
was
absolutely
no
chance
of
his
ever
getting
back
to
sleep
he
finally
rolled
over
again
being
very
careful
to
avoid
any
more
poisonous
sunlight
getting
up
was
an
even
more
difficult
process
but
malone
knew
it
had
to
be
managed
somehow
he
got
his
feet
firmly
planted
on
the
floor
and
sat
up
it
had
been
a
remarkable
feat
he
told
himself
he
deserved
a
medal
that
reminded
him
of
the
night
before
he
had
been
thinking
quite
a
lot
about
the
medals
he
deserved
for
various
feats
he
had
even
awarded
some
of
them
to
himself
in
the
shape
of
liquid
decoctions
he
remembered
all
that
quite
well
there
were
a
lot
of
cloudy
things
in
his
mind
but
from
all
the
testimony
he
could
gather
he
imagined
that
he
had
quite
a
time
the
night
before
quite
a
wonderful
time
as
a
matter
of
fact
not
that
that
reflection
did
anything
for
him
now
as
he
opened
his
eyes
one
at
a
time
he
thought
of
boyd
once
long
ago
ages
and
ages
ago
he
had
had
to
wake
boyd
up
and
he
recalled
how
rough
he
had
been
about
it
that
had
been
unforgivable
he
made
a
mental
note
to
apologize
to
boyd
the
next
time
he
saw
him
if
he
could
ever
see
again
now
he
knew
how
boyd
had
felt
and
it
was
terrible
still
sitting
on
the
bed
he
told
himself
that
in
spite
of
everything
he
was
lucky
to
judge
by
his
vague
memories
he
had
quite
a
time
the
night
before
and
if
the
hangover
was
payment
for
it
then
he
was
willing
to
accept
the
payment
almost
because
it
had
really
been
a
terrific
time
the
only
nagging
thought
in
his
mind
was
that
there
had
been
something
vital
he
forgotten
tickets
he
said
aloud
and
was
surprised
that
his
voice
was
audible
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
too
audible
the
noise
made
him
wince
slightly
he
shifted
his
position
very
quietly
and
he
had
forgotten
the
tickets
no
he
distinctly
remembered
going
to
see
hot
and
finding
seats
and
actually
sitting
through
the
show
with
dorothy
at
his
side
he
could
honestly
say
that
he
remembered
much
of
the
show
itself
but
that
could
be
the
important
thing
he
forgotten
by
no
means
he
had
heard
that
it
was
a
good
show
though
sometime
he
reminded
himself
he
would
have
to
get
tickets
and
actually
see
it
he
checked
through
the
evening
drinks
dinner
he
had
had
dinner
had
he
yes
he
had
he
recalled
a
broiled
sea
bass
looking
up
at
him
with
mournful
eyes
he
could
have
dreamed
anything
like
that
and
then
the
theater
and
after
that
some
more
drinks
and
so
on
and
so
on
and
so
on
right
to
his
arrival
back
in
his
hotel
room
at
in
the
morning
on
a
bright
boiled
cloud
he
even
remembered
arguing
with
dorothy
about
taking
her
home
won
that
round
by
ducking
into
a
subway
entrance
and
he
had
turned
around
after
she
left
him
and
headed
for
home
had
he
taken
a
taxi
yes
malone
decided
he
had
he
even
remembered
that
then
what
had
he
forgotten
he
had
met
dorothy
he
told
himself
starting
all
over
again
in
an
effort
to
locate
the
gaps
at
six
right
after
phoning
my
god
malone
said
and
winced
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
ten
in
the
morning
he
had
completely
forgotten
to
call
fernack
and
lynch
hangover
or
no
hangover
malone
told
himself
grimly
there
was
work
to
be
done
somehow
he
managed
to
get
to
his
feet
and
start
moving
he
checked
boyd
room
after
a
while
but
his
partner
was
home
at
work
malone
thought
i
lie
here
useless
and
he
thought
of
the
sermon
on
the
evils
of
alcohol
and
decided
he
better
read
it
to
himself
instead
of
delivering
it
to
boyd
but
he
did
waste
any
time
with
it
by
he
was
showered
and
shaved
his
teeth
were
brushed
and
he
was
dressed
he
felt
he
estimated
about
fifteen
hundred
per
cent
better
that
was
still
lousy
but
it
was
quite
as
bad
as
it
had
been
he
could
move
around
and
talk
and
even
think
a
little
if
he
was
careful
about
it
before
he
left
he
took
a
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
well
he
told
himself
that
was
nice
it
hardly
showed
at
all
he
looked
tired
to
be
sure
but
that
was
almost
normal
the
eyes
were
bloodshot
red
and
did
seem
to
bug
out
at
all
although
malone
would
have
sworn
that
they
were
bleeding
all
over
his
face
his
head
was
its
normal
size
as
near
as
he
remembered
it
was
not
swollen
visibly
or
pulsing
like
a
jellyfish
at
every
move
he
looked
even
better
than
he
felt
he
started
for
the
door
and
then
stopped
himself
there
was
no
need
to
go
out
so
early
he
could
start
work
right
in
his
own
hotel
room
and
not
even
have
to
worry
about
the
streets
of
new
york
the
cars
or
the
pedestrians
for
a
while
he
thought
wistfully
about
a
hair
of
the
hound
decided
against
it
with
great
firmness
and
sat
down
to
the
phone
he
dialed
a
number
and
the
face
of
commissioner
fernack
appeared
almost
at
once
malone
forced
himself
to
smile
cheerfully
reasonably
sure
that
he
was
going
to
crack
something
as
he
did
it
hello
john
henry
he
said
in
what
he
hoped
was
a
good
imitation
of
a
happy
carefree
voice
and
how
are
you
this
lovely
morning
me
fernack
said
sourly
i
in
great
shape
tiptop
dancing
in
the
goddamn
daisies
malone
how
did
you
any
news
for
me
malone
said
fernack
waited
a
long
time
before
he
answered
and
when
he
did
his
voice
was
dangerously
soft
and
calm
malone
he
said
when
you
asked
for
this
survey
just
what
kind
of
news
did
you
expect
to
get
a
godawful
lot
of
impossible
crimes
malone
said
frankly
how
did
i
do
john
henry
you
did
damn
well
fernack
said
too
damn
well
listen
malone
how
could
you
know
about
anything
like
this
malone
blinked
well
he
said
we
have
our
sources
confidential
top
secret
i
sure
you
understand
commissioner
hurriedly
he
added
what
does
the
breakdown
look
like
it
looks
like
hell
fernack
said
about
eight
months
ago
according
to
the
computer
there
was
a
terrific
upswing
in
certain
kinds
of
crime
and
since
then
it
been
pretty
steady
right
at
the
top
of
the
swing
has
moved
down
hardly
at
all
great
malone
said
fernack
stared
what
he
said
i
mean
malone
stopped
thought
of
an
answer
and
tried
it
i
mean
that
checks
out
my
guess
my
information
sources
fernack
seemed
to
weigh
risks
in
his
mind
malone
i
know
fbi
he
said
at
last
but
this
sounds
pretty
fishy
to
me
pretty
strange
you
have
no
idea
how
strange
malone
said
truthfully
i
beginning
to
fernack
said
and
if
i
ever
find
out
that
you
had
anything
to
do
with
this
me
and
do
look
innocent
fernack
said
it
does
succeed
in
looking
anything
but
horrible
you
remind
me
of
a
convicted
murderer
trying
to
steal
thirty
cents
from
the
prison
chaplain
what
would
i
have
to
do
with
all
these
crimes
malone
said
and
what
kind
of
crimes
were
they
anyway
what
you
have
to
do
with
them
fernack
said
is
an
unanswered
question
and
so
long
as
it
remains
unanswered
malone
you
safe
but
when
i
come
up
with
enough
facts
to
answer
it
do
be
silly
commissioner
malone
said
how
about
those
crimes
what
kind
were
they
burglaries
fernack
said
and
i
have
a
hunch
you
know
that
well
enough
most
of
them
were
just
burglaries
locked
barrooms
for
instance
early
in
the
morning
there
never
any
sign
of
tampering
with
the
locks
no
sign
of
breaking
and
entering
no
sign
of
any
alarms
being
tampered
with
in
any
way
but
the
money
gone
from
the
cash
register
and
all
of
the
liquor
is
gone
too
malone
stared
the
liquor
he
said
in
a
dazed
voice
well
fernack
said
all
of
it
that
in
plain
sight
anyway
except
for
the
open
bottles
disappeared
gone
without
a
trace
and
most
of
the
time
the
extra
stock
gone
too
from
the
basement
or
wherever
they
happen
to
keep
it
that
a
lot
of
liquor
malone
said
a
hell
of
a
lot
fernack
said
some
of
the
bars
have
gone
broke
not
being
insured
against
the
losses
the
thought
of
thousands
of
bottles
of
liquor
millions
of
bottles
went
through
malone
mind
like
an
ice
pick
he
could
almost
see
them
handle
them
taste
them
hair
of
the
dog
he
muttered
what
hair
what
a
dog
what
did
you
say
malone
nothing
malone
said
hastily
nothing
at
all
after
a
second
another
query
occurred
to
him
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
only
bars
were
robbed
nothing
else
oh
no
fernack
said
bars
are
only
part
of
it
malone
why
are
you
asking
me
to
tell
you
this
because
i
want
to
know
malone
said
patiently
i
still
think
fernack
began
and
then
said
never
but
it
has
been
only
bars
supermarkets
homes
cleaning
and
tailoring
shops
jewelers
hell
malone
you
name
it
and
it
been
hit
malone
tried
valiantly
to
resist
temptation
but
he
was
not
at
his
best
and
he
lost
all
right
he
said
i
will
name
it
here
a
list
of
places
that
have
even
been
touched
by
the
rising
crime
wave
banks
for
one
malone
safes
that
have
been
locked
for
another
malone
went
on
homes
with
wall
safes
though
that
not
quite
accurate
the
homes
may
have
been
robbed
but
the
safes
wo
have
been
touched
malone
how
much
do
you
know
fernack
said
my
god
man
i
make
a
general
rule
for
you
malone
said
any
place
that
fits
the
following
description
is
safe
it
got
a
secure
lock
on
it
and
it
too
small
for
a
human
being
to
get
into
fernack
opened
his
mouth
shut
it
and
stared
downward
obviously
scanning
some
papers
lying
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
malone
waited
patiently
for
the
explosion
but
it
never
came
instead
fernack
said
you
know
malone
you
remind
me
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
really
malone
said
pleasantly
you
certainly
do
fernack
said
there
just
one
small
difference
you
an
fbi
man
and
he
a
crook
if
that
a
difference
it
is
malone
said
and
on
behalf
of
the
fbi
i
resent
the
allegation
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
defy
the
allegator
but
neither
here
nor
there
he
continued
if
that
the
difference
what
are
the
similarities
fernack
drew
in
a
deep
hissing
breath
and
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
as
calm
and
quiet
as
a
coiled
cobra
the
both
of
you
come
up
with
the
goddamnedest
answers
to
things
things
i
never
knew
about
or
even
cared
about
before
things
i
wish
i
never
heard
of
things
that
do
have
any
explanation
and
he
stopped
his
face
dark
in
the
screen
malone
wondered
what
color
it
was
going
to
turn
and
decided
on
purple
as
a
good
choice
well
malone
said
at
last
and
you
always
so
goddamned
right
it
makes
me
sick
fernack
finished
flatly
he
rubbed
a
hand
through
his
hair
and
stared
into
the
screen
at
malone
how
did
you
know
all
this
stuff
he
said
malone
waited
one
full
second
while
fernack
got
darker
and
darker
on
the
screen
when
he
judged
that
the
color
was
right
he
said
quietly
i
prescient
and
thanks
a
lot
john
henry
just
send
the
reports
to
me
personally
at
street
by
messenger
so
long
he
cut
the
circuit
just
as
fernack
started
now
malone
with
a
satisfied
somewhat
sheepish
smile
malone
dialed
another
number
this
time
a
desk
sergeant
told
him
politely
that
lynch
at
the
precinct
and
would
arrive
until
noon
malone
had
lynch
home
number
he
dialed
it
it
was
a
long
wait
before
the
lieutenant
answered
and
he
did
look
much
like
a
police
officer
when
his
face
finally
showed
up
on
the
screen
his
hair
was
uncombed
and
he
was
unshaven
his
eyes
were
slightly
bleary
but
he
was
definitely
awake
oh
malone
said
hello
hi
there
lynch
said
with
enormous
cheerfulness
old
old
pal
old
friend
what
wrong
malone
said
wrong
lynch
said
nothing
nothing
nothing
at
all
i
just
wanted
to
thank
you
for
not
waking
me
up
last
night
i
only
waited
for
your
call
until
midnight
then
i
decided
i
just
was
very
important
to
you
you
obviously
had
much
bigger
things
on
your
mind
as
a
matter
of
fact
malone
said
speculatively
eying
figure
dressed
in
a
pair
of
trousers
and
a
you
right
that
what
i
thought
lynch
said
and
i
decided
that
since
you
were
so
terribly
busy
it
could
wait
until
i
woke
up
or
even
until
i
got
down
to
the
station
how
about
it
listen
lynch
malone
said
we
made
a
bet
ten
to
one
i
just
want
to
know
if
i
can
come
down
to
collect
or
not
there
was
a
second
of
silence
all
right
lynch
said
at
last
looking
crestfallen
i
owe
you
a
buck
every
last
one
of
those
kids
has
skipped
out
on
us
good
malone
said
he
wondered
briefly
just
what
was
good
about
it
and
decided
he
rather
have
lost
the
money
to
lynch
but
facts
he
reflected
were
facts
thoroughly
nasty
facts
i
spent
all
night
tracing
them
lynch
said
got
nowhere
nowhere
at
all
malone
how
did
you
know
classified
malone
said
very
classified
but
you
sure
all
gone
vanished
lynch
face
reddened
sure
i
sure
he
said
every
last
one
of
them
is
gone
and
what
more
do
you
want
me
to
do
about
it
he
paused
then
added
what
do
you
expect
malone
miracles
malone
shook
his
head
gently
no
he
said
i
oh
never
mind
lynch
said
but
i
look
malone
lynch
said
there
a
guy
who
wants
to
talk
to
you
one
of
the
silent
spooks
malone
said
hopefully
lynch
shook
his
head
and
made
a
growling
noise
do
be
silly
he
said
it
just
that
this
guy
might
have
some
information
but
he
wo
say
anything
to
me
about
it
he
a
social
worker
or
something
like
that
social
worker
malone
said
he
works
with
the
kids
right
i
guess
lynch
said
his
name
kettleman
albert
kettleman
malone
nodded
okay
he
said
i
be
right
over
hey
lynch
said
hold
on
he
not
here
now
what
do
you
think
this
is
my
house
or
a
reception
center
sorry
malone
said
wearily
where
and
when
how
about
three
at
the
precinct
station
lynch
said
i
can
have
him
there
by
then
and
you
can
get
together
and
talk
he
paused
nobody
likes
the
cops
he
said
people
hear
the
fbi
mixed
up
in
this
and
they
figure
the
cops
are
all
or
something
sorry
to
hear
it
malone
said
i
bet
you
are
lynch
told
him
bitterly
malone
shrugged
anyway
he
said
i
see
you
at
three
right
right
lynch
said
and
malone
flipped
off
he
sat
there
for
a
few
seconds
grinning
quietly
his
brain
throbbed
like
an
overheated
motor
but
he
did
really
mind
any
more
his
theory
had
been
justified
and
that
was
the
most
important
thing
the
silent
spooks
were
all
teleports
eight
of
them
eight
kids
on
the
loose
stealing
everything
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
and
completely
safe
how
could
you
catch
a
boy
who
just
disappeared
when
you
started
for
him
no
wonder
their
names
had
appeared
on
the
police
blotter
malone
thought
spooks
did
get
into
trouble
they
did
have
to
they
could
get
into
any
place
big
enough
to
hold
them
take
what
they
wanted
and
just
disappear
they
been
doing
it
for
about
eight
months
according
to
the
figures
malone
had
received
from
fernack
maybe
teleportative
ability
did
develop
until
you
were
around
fourteen
or
fifteen
but
it
had
developed
in
these
kids
and
they
were
using
it
in
the
most
obvious
way
they
had
a
sure
method
of
getting
away
from
the
cops
and
a
sure
method
of
taking
anything
they
wanted
no
wonder
they
had
so
much
money
malone
got
up
feeling
slightly
dazed
and
left
the
hotel
room
by
three
he
was
again
among
the
living
maybe
his
occupations
had
had
something
to
do
with
it
he
spent
about
four
hours
supervising
operation
dismemberment
and
then
listening
to
the
reports
on
the
dismantled
cadillacs
it
was
nice
peaceful
unimportant
work
but
there
just
was
anything
else
to
do
fbi
work
was
per
cent
marking
time
anyway
malone
felt
grateful
that
there
was
any
action
at
all
in
what
he
was
doing
leibowitz
had
found
all
sort
of
things
in
the
commandeered
caddies
everything
from
guns
and
narcotics
to
pornographic
pictures
in
lots
of
three
hundred
for
shipment
into
new
york
city
from
the
suburbs
where
the
processing
plant
probably
was
of
course
there
had
been
personal
effects
too
maps
and
lucky
dolls
and
just
once
a
single
crutch
malone
wondered
about
that
for
quite
a
while
who
just
walk
off
and
leave
one
crutch
in
a
car
but
people
did
things
like
that
all
the
time
he
finally
told
himself
heavily
there
was
any
explanation
for
it
and
there
probably
never
would
be
but
in
spite
of
the
majestic
assortment
of
valuables
found
in
the
cars
there
was
no
sign
of
anything
remotely
resembling
an
brain
leibowitz
had
found
just
about
everything
except
what
he
was
looking
for
at
a
quarter
to
three
malone
gave
up
the
search
was
quite
finished
but
he
heard
enough
to
last
him
for
a
long
time
he
grabbed
a
cab
downstairs
and
went
over
to
lynch
office
to
meet
kettleman
the
social
worker
or
something
was
a
large
balding
man
about
six
feet
tall
malone
estimated
his
weight
as
close
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
he
looked
every
pound
of
it
his
face
was
round
without
being
chubby
and
his
body
was
stocky
and
hard
he
wore
glasses
and
he
was
going
bald
in
front
his
face
was
like
a
mask
it
was
held
in
a
gentle
almost
eager
expression
that
malone
would
have
sworn
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
way
kettleman
felt
underneath
lynch
performed
the
introductions
escorted
the
two
of
them
to
one
of
the
interrogation
rooms
at
the
rear
of
the
station
and
left
them
there
with
if
either
of
you
guys
comes
up
with
anything
let
me
know
for
a
parting
shot
kettleman
blinked
slowly
behind
his
glasses
malone
he
said
i
understand
that
the
fbi
is
interested
in
one
of
the
ah
adolescent
social
groups
with
which
i
work
well
the
silent
spooks
malone
said
that
right
the
spooks
kettleman
said
his
voice
was
rather
higher
than
malone
would
have
expected
oddly
breathy
without
much
depth
to
it
my
yes
i
did
want
to
talk
to
somebody
about
it
and
i
thought
you
might
be
the
man
i
be
interested
in
anything
you
have
to
say
malone
said
diplomatically
he
was
beginning
to
doubt
whether
he
get
any
real
information
out
of
kettleman
but
it
was
impossible
to
tell
he
sat
back
in
a
hard
wooden
chair
and
tried
to
look
fascinated
well
kettleman
said
tentatively
the
boys
themselves
have
sort
of
a
word
for
it
they
say
that
there
was
something
oddball
about
the
spooks
do
you
understand
not
just
the
fact
that
they
never
drink
liquor
but
something
strange
malone
said
is
that
what
you
mean
ah
kettleman
said
of
course
he
acted
malone
thought
as
if
he
had
never
heard
the
word
before
and
was
both
pleased
and
startled
by
its
sound
perhaps
i
had
better
explain
my
position
a
little
more
clearly
he
said
that
will
give
you
an
idea
of
just
where
i
into
this
picture
whatever
you
think
best
malone
said
resigning
himself
to
a
very
dull
hour
he
tried
to
picture
kettleman
in
the
midst
of
a
gang
of
juvenile
delinquents
it
was
very
hard
to
do
i
a
social
worker
kettleman
said
working
on
an
individual
basis
with
these
social
groups
that
the
adolescents
have
formed
it
my
job
to
make
friends
with
them
become
accepted
by
them
and
try
to
turn
their
hostile
impulses
toward
society
into
more
useful
more
acceptable
channels
i
see
malone
said
feeling
that
something
was
expected
of
him
that
fine
oh
we
do
expect
praise
we
social
workers
kettleman
said
instantly
the
worth
of
a
good
job
well
done
that
enough
for
us
he
smiled
the
effect
was
a
little
unsettling
as
if
a
hippopotamus
had
begun
to
laugh
like
a
hyena
but
to
continue
malone
he
said
of
course
malone
said
certainly
i
worked
with
many
of
the
organizations
in
this
neighborhood
kettleman
said
and
i
been
quite
successful
in
getting
to
know
them
and
in
being
accepted
by
them
of
course
the
major
part
of
my
job
is
more
difficult
but
well
i
sure
that
enough
about
my
own
background
that
is
what
you
interested
in
now
is
it
he
looked
penitent
malone
said
it
all
right
i
do
mind
he
shifted
positions
on
the
hard
chair
well
then
kettleman
said
with
the
air
of
a
man
suddenly
getting
down
to
business
he
leaned
forward
eagerly
his
eyes
big
and
bright
behind
the
lenses
there
something
very
peculiar
about
those
boys
he
said
in
a
whisper
really
malone
said
very
peculiar
indeed
kettleman
said
my
yes
all
of
the
other
social
groups
are
afraid
of
them
big
huh
malone
said
big
strong
boys
who
oh
my
no
kettleman
said
my
goodness
no
all
of
the
spooks
are
rather
slight
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
got
but
it
is
strength
my
goodness
malone
said
tiredly
i
doubt
if
in
the
language
of
my
own
groups
any
one
of
the
spooks
could
punch
his
way
out
of
a
paper
bag
kettleman
said
it
more
than
that
frankly
malone
said
i
inclined
to
agree
with
you
but
what
is
this
something
that
frightens
everyone
else
kettleman
leaned
even
closer
i
not
sure
he
said
softly
i
say
for
certain
malone
i
only
heard
rumors
well
malone
said
rumors
might
rumors
are
a
very
powerful
force
among
my
groups
malone
kettleman
said
i
learned
over
the
years
to
keep
my
ear
to
the
ground
as
it
were
and
pay
very
close
attention
to
rumors
i
sure
malone
said
patiently
but
what
did
this
particular
rumor
say
well
kettleman
said
and
stopped
well
he
said
again
and
at
last
he
gulped
and
got
it
out
magicians
malone
they
say
the
spooks
are
magicians
that
they
can
come
and
go
at
will
make
themselves
invisible
all
sorts
of
things
of
course
i
do
believe
that
but
oh
it
quite
true
malone
said
solemn
faced
it
what
perfectly
true
malone
said
we
know
all
that
oh
my
kettleman
said
his
face
took
on
a
whitish
cast
oh
my
goodness
he
said
is
that
is
that
amazing
he
swallowed
hard
true
all
the
time
he
said
magicians
i
you
see
this
information
is
new
to
us
malone
said
oh
kettleman
said
no
of
course
not
my
it
rather
disconcerting
to
think
about
is
it
there
malone
said
i
agree
with
you
kettleman
fell
silent
malone
offered
him
a
cigarette
but
the
social
worker
refused
with
a
pale
smile
and
malone
lit
one
for
himself
he
took
a
couple
of
puffs
in
the
silence
and
then
kettleman
said
well
malone
lieutenant
lynch
did
say
that
i
was
to
tell
you
everything
i
could
about
these
boys
i
sure
we
all
appreciate
that
malone
said
at
random
wondering
exactly
what
he
meant
there
is
well
there
is
one
more
thing
kettleman
said
ordinarily
of
course
i
would
say
anything
about
this
to
anyone
in
my
line
of
work
malone
you
learn
the
need
for
confidence
for
being
able
to
keep
one
word
certainly
malone
said
wondering
what
startling
new
fact
was
on
its
way
now
and
we
certainly
try
to
keep
the
confidence
of
the
boys
kettleman
said
maddeningly
we
would
betray
them
to
the
police
in
any
way
unless
it
were
absolutely
necessary
betray
them
kettleman
malone
said
just
what
are
you
trying
to
tell
me
it
about
their
meeting
place
kettleman
said
oh
my
i
not
at
all
sure
i
ought
to
tell
you
this
he
wrung
his
pale
fat
hands
together
and
looked
at
malone
appealingly
now
now
malone
said
feeling
foolish
it
perfectly
all
right
we
do
want
to
hurt
the
spooks
not
any
more
than
we
have
to
you
can
tell
me
mr
kettleman
oh
kettleman
said
well
the
spooks
do
have
a
sort
of
secret
meeting
place
you
know
and
they
meet
there
he
stopped
malone
said
where
is
it
oh
it
a
big
empty
warehouse
kettleman
said
i
really
feel
terrible
about
this
they
meeting
there
tonight
sometime
or
what
the
rumors
say
i
should
be
telling
you
of
course
you
should
malone
said
trying
to
sound
reassuring
do
worry
about
a
thing
kettleman
tonight
that
right
kettleman
said
eagerly
he
grinned
and
then
looked
morosely
down
at
his
hands
do
you
know
where
this
warehouse
is
malone
said
if
any
of
the
other
little
social
groups
use
it
oh
no
they
do
kettleman
said
that
what
makes
it
so
funny
you
see
the
warehouse
is
deserted
but
it
kept
in
good
repair
there
are
bars
on
the
windows
and
it
protected
by
all
sorts
of
alarm
systems
and
things
like
that
so
none
of
the
others
can
use
it
only
the
spooks
you
ca
get
in
without
a
key
not
at
all
but
do
the
spooks
malone
began
oh
no
kettleman
moaned
they
do
have
a
key
at
least
what
the
other
groups
say
the
spooks
just
just
melt
borough
the
walls
or
something
like
that
kettleman
malone
said
where
is
this
warehouse
i
should
be
telling
you
this
kettleman
said
malone
sighed
please
kettleman
you
know
we
working
for
the
good
of
those
boys
do
you
well
i
sure
we
are
malone
said
so
you
can
tell
me
kettleman
blinked
behind
his
glasses
and
moaned
a
little
malone
waited
with
his
hands
tense
in
his
lap
at
last
kettleman
said
on
west
street
near
chambers
that
downtown
he
gave
malone
an
address
that
where
it
is
he
said
but
you
wo
do
anything
to
the
boys
will
you
they
basically
good
boys
no
matter
what
and
they
do
worry
about
it
kettleman
malone
said
we
take
care
of
the
spooks
oh
kettleman
said
yes
sure
he
got
up
malone
said
there
just
one
more
thing
mr
kettleman
yes
the
big
man
voice
had
reached
the
high
breathy
pitch
of
a
fife
do
you
have
any
idea
what
time
the
spooks
usually
meet
well
now
kettleman
said
i
do
really
know
you
see
the
reason
i
wanted
to
tell
you
all
this
was
because
lieutenant
lynch
was
checking
up
on
all
those
boys
yesterday
and
i
thought
he
stopped
and
cleared
his
throat
and
when
he
began
again
his
voice
had
dropped
almost
to
a
whisper
well
malone
i
thought
after
all
that
since
he
was
asking
me
questions
you
know
questions
about
where
the
spooks
were
and
all
of
that
since
he
was
asking
me
questions
yes
malone
said
i
thought
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
about
them
kettleman
said
where
they
were
and
all
of
that
malone
stood
up
kettleman
he
said
in
his
most
official
voice
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
fbi
appreciates
what
you
done
your
information
will
probably
be
very
helpful
to
us
and
the
fbi
certainly
commends
you
for
being
enough
to
come
to
us
and
tell
us
what
you
know
he
thought
for
a
second
and
then
added
in
the
name
of
the
fbi
kettleman
well
done
kettleman
stared
smiled
and
gulped
my
goodness
he
said
well
he
smiled
again
a
little
more
broadly
one
has
one
duty
you
know
my
yes
duty
he
nodded
to
malone
of
course
malone
said
going
to
the
door
and
opening
it
thanks
again
mr
kettleman
kettleman
saw
the
open
door
and
headed
for
it
blindly
as
he
left
he
flashed
one
last
smile
after
malone
who
sighed
shut
the
door
and
leaned
against
it
for
a
second
the
things
an
fbi
agent
had
to
go
through
when
he
had
recovered
he
opened
the
door
again
and
peered
carefully
down
the
hallway
to
make
sure
kettleman
had
gone
then
he
left
the
interrogation
room
and
went
down
the
hall
past
the
desk
sergeant
and
up
the
stairs
to
lieutenant
lynch
office
he
was
still
breathing
a
little
hard
when
he
opened
lynch
door
and
lynch
did
seem
to
be
expecting
him
at
all
he
was
very
busy
with
a
veritable
snow
flurry
of
papers
and
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
involved
with
them
steadily
ever
since
he
had
left
malone
and
kettleman
alone
downstairs
well
malone
said
hello
there
lieutenant
lynch
looked
up
his
face
a
mask
of
surprise
oh
he
said
you
through
with
kettleman
i
through
malone
said
as
if
you
did
know
he
looked
at
lynch
for
a
long
minute
and
then
said
lieutenant
lynch
had
gone
right
back
to
his
papers
he
looked
up
again
with
a
bland
expression
yes
lieutenant
how
reliable
is
kettleman
malone
said
lynch
shrugged
he
always
been
pretty
good
with
the
kids
if
what
you
mean
you
know
these
social
workers
i
never
got
much
information
out
of
him
he
feels
it
his
duty
to
the
kids
i
know
some
such
thing
why
do
you
ask
well
malone
said
what
he
told
me
was
he
kidding
me
or
does
he
know
what
he
talking
about
was
what
he
said
reasonably
accurate
how
would
i
know
lynch
said
after
all
you
were
down
there
alone
were
you
i
was
up
here
working
if
you
tell
me
what
he
said
maybe
i
be
able
to
tell
you
whether
or
not
i
think
he
was
kidding
malone
placed
both
his
palms
on
the
lieutenant
desk
mashing
a
couple
of
piles
of
papers
he
leaned
forward
slowly
his
eyes
on
lynch
bland
innocent
face
now
look
lynch
he
said
i
like
you
i
really
do
you
a
good
cop
you
get
things
done
well
thanks
lynch
said
but
i
do
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
i
just
do
want
you
trying
to
kid
your
malone
said
kid
you
lynch
said
i
do
get
it
come
on
now
malone
said
i
know
that
room
was
bugged
just
as
well
as
you
do
it
was
the
sensible
thing
for
you
to
pull
and
you
pulled
it
you
got
the
whole
thing
recorded
have
you
me
lynch
said
why
would
i
oh
cut
it
out
malone
said
impatiently
let
not
play
games
okay
there
was
a
second
of
silence
all
right
lynch
said
so
i
recorded
the
conversation
kill
me
crucify
me
i
stealing
fbi
secrets
i
a
spy
secretly
working
for
a
foreign
power
take
me
out
and
electrocute
me
i
do
want
to
fight
you
malone
said
wearily
so
you
got
the
stuff
recorded
that
your
business
my
business
sure
malone
said
cheerfully
as
long
as
you
do
try
to
use
it
now
malone
lynch
began
this
is
touchy
stuff
malone
said
we
going
to
have
to
take
a
lot
of
care
in
handling
it
and
i
do
want
you
throwing
raids
all
over
the
place
and
mixing
everything
up
malone
i
eventually
malone
said
i
going
to
need
your
help
with
these
kids
but
for
right
now
i
want
to
handle
this
my
way
without
any
interference
i
would
think
of
you
wanted
information
malone
said
fine
that
all
right
with
me
you
got
the
information
and
that
okay
too
but
if
you
try
to
use
it
before
i
say
the
word
i
i
talk
to
good
old
uncle
john
henry
fernack
and
he
help
me
out
he
give
you
a
refresher
course
on
how
to
be
a
beat
cop
in
kew
gardens
it
nice
and
lonely
out
there
now
lynch
you
love
it
malone
lynch
said
tiredly
do
give
me
any
arguments
malone
said
i
do
want
any
arguments
i
wo
argue
with
you
malone
lynch
said
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
something
malone
stepped
away
from
the
desk
all
right
he
said
go
ahead
lynch
took
a
deep
breath
malone
i
not
trying
to
queer
your
pitch
he
said
if
i
were
going
to
pull
a
raid
here
what
i
have
to
do
get
my
own
cops
together
then
call
the
precinct
that
covers
that
old
warehouse
we
do
cover
the
warehouse
from
here
malone
and
we
need
the
responsible
precinct
aid
in
anything
we
did
down
there
malone
said
well
all
i
not
only
that
lynch
said
i
have
to
call
safe
and
loft
and
get
them
in
on
it
a
warehouse
raid
would
probably
be
their
baby
first
of
all
that
means
it
takes
this
precinct
the
warehouse
precinct
and
the
safe
and
loft
squad
all
together
to
raid
that
warehouse
malone
would
i
pull
a
raid
at
this
stage
if
i
had
to
go
through
all
that
without
knowing
what
the
hell
i
was
going
to
find
down
there
oh
malone
said
if
those
kids
can
just
appear
and
disappear
at
will
lynch
said
i
not
going
to
pull
a
raid
on
them
and
end
up
looking
like
a
damn
fool
until
i
got
some
way
of
making
sure
they
there
when
the
raid
goes
through
malone
coughed
gently
okay
he
said
at
last
sorry
there
only
one
thing
i
want
lynch
said
i
want
to
be
able
to
move
as
soon
as
possible
well
sure
malone
said
apologetically
and
that
means
i
going
to
have
to
be
informed
lynch
said
i
want
to
know
what
going
on
as
fast
as
possible
malone
nodded
gently
sure
he
said
i
tell
you
everything
that
happens
as
soon
as
i
know
myself
but
right
now
i
have
got
a
thing
for
you
all
i
have
is
a
kind
of
theory
and
it
pretty
screwy
he
stopped
lynch
looked
up
at
him
how
screwy
can
it
get
he
said
the
facts
are
nutty
enough
you
have
absolutely
no
idea
malone
assured
him
i
not
even
saying
a
word
about
this
not
until
i
prove
it
out
one
way
or
another
i
not
even
thinking
about
it
not
until
it
stops
sounding
so
nutty
to
me
okay
malone
lynch
said
i
can
see
a
piece
of
it
if
no
more
the
fueyo
kid
vanishes
mysteriously
never
mind
all
that
about
you
getting
him
out
of
the
interrogation
room
by
some
kind
of
confidential
method
there
is
any
confidential
method
i
know
that
better
than
you
do
i
had
to
say
something
did
i
malone
asked
apologetically
so
the
kid
disappears
lynch
said
brushing
malone
question
away
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
so
now
i
hear
all
this
stuff
from
kettleman
and
it
begins
to
add
up
the
kids
can
disappear
somehow
and
reappear
some
place
else
walk
through
walls
he
shrugged
how
should
i
know
but
they
can
sure
as
hell
do
something
like
it
something
malone
said
like
i
said
it
sounds
screwy
i
do
like
it
lynch
said
malone
nodded
nobody
likes
it
he
said
but
keep
it
under
your
hat
i
give
you
everything
i
have
whenever
i
have
anything
and
by
the
way
yes
lynch
said
thanks
for
giving
me
and
kettleman
a
chance
to
talk
malone
said
even
if
you
had
reasons
of
your
own
oh
lynch
said
you
mean
the
recording
i
was
a
little
suspicious
malone
said
i
did
think
you
give
kettleman
to
me
without
getting
for
yourself
would
you
lynch
said
malone
shrugged
i
not
crazy
either
he
said
lynch
picked
up
a
handful
of
papers
i
got
all
this
work
to
do
he
said
so
i
see
you
later
okay
malone
said
and
if
you
need
my
help
lynch
said
just
yell
right
i
yell
malone
said
do
worry
about
that
i
yell
loud
enough
to
get
myself
heard
in
space
station
one
the
afternoon
was
bright
and
sunny
but
it
did
match
malone
mood
he
got
a
cab
outside
the
precinct
station
and
headed
for
street
dining
off
his
nails
en
route
when
he
hit
the
fbi
headquarters
he
called
washington
and
got
burris
on
the
line
he
made
a
full
report
to
the
fbi
chief
including
his
wild
theory
and
everything
else
that
had
happened
and
there
was
this
notebook
he
said
and
reached
into
his
jacket
pocket
for
it
the
pocket
was
empty
what
notebook
burris
said
malone
tried
to
remember
if
he
left
the
book
in
his
room
he
could
quite
recall
this
book
i
picked
up
he
said
and
described
it
i
send
it
on
or
bring
it
in
when
the
case
is
over
all
right
burris
said
malone
went
on
with
his
description
of
what
had
happened
when
finished
burris
heaved
a
great
sigh
my
goodness
he
said
last
year
it
was
telepathic
spies
and
this
year
it
teleporting
thieves
malone
i
hate
to
think
about
next
year
i
wish
you
had
said
that
malone
said
sadly
burris
blinked
why
he
said
oh
just
because
malone
said
i
have
even
had
time
to
think
about
next
year
yet
but
i
think
about
it
now
well
maybe
it
wo
be
so
bad
burris
said
malone
shook
his
head
no
chief
he
said
you
wrong
it
be
worse
this
is
bad
enough
burris
said
it
a
great
vacation
malone
said
please
burris
said
did
i
have
any
idea
yes
malone
said
burris
eyes
closed
all
right
malone
he
said
after
a
little
pause
let
get
back
to
the
report
at
least
it
explains
the
red
cadillac
business
sergeant
jukovsky
was
hit
by
a
boy
who
vanished
vanished
my
god
i
was
hit
by
a
boy
who
vanished
too
malone
said
bitterly
but
of
course
i
just
an
fbi
agent
expendable
nobody
cares
about
do
say
that
malone
burris
said
you
one
of
my
most
valuable
agents
malone
tried
to
stop
himself
from
beaming
but
he
could
well
chief
he
began
i
vanishing
boys
burris
muttered
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
them
malone
i
was
hoping
you
might
have
some
kind
of
suggestion
malone
said
me
well
malone
said
i
suppose
i
figure
it
out
when
i
catch
them
but
i
did
want
something
from
you
chief
anything
malone
burris
said
anything
at
all
i
want
you
to
get
hold
of
out
at
yucca
flats
if
you
can
he
the
best
psionics
man
westinghouse
has
right
now
and
i
might
need
him
if
you
say
so
burris
said
doubtfully
well
malone
said
these
kids
are
teleports
and
maybe
there
some
way
to
stop
a
teleport
give
him
a
good
hard
kick
in
the
psi
for
instance
in
the
what
never
mind
malone
said
savagely
but
if
i
going
to
get
any
information
on
what
makes
teleports
tick
i
going
to
have
to
get
it
from
right
right
burris
said
so
get
in
touch
with
malone
said
i
have
him
call
you
burris
said
meanwhile
well
meanwhile
just
carry
on
malone
i
got
every
confidence
in
you
thanks
malone
growled
if
anybody
can
crack
a
case
like
this
burris
said
it
you
i
suppose
it
had
better
be
malone
said
and
rang
off
then
he
started
to
think
the
notebook
was
in
his
pockets
he
checked
every
one
even
the
jacket
pocket
where
he
usually
kept
a
handkerchief
and
nothing
else
it
was
anywhere
on
his
person
had
he
left
it
in
his
room
he
thought
about
that
for
several
minutes
and
finally
decided
that
he
had
he
had
taken
it
out
of
his
pocket
for
one
thing
and
if
it
had
fallen
to
the
ground
he
could
have
helped
seeing
it
of
course
he
put
his
wallet
keys
change
and
other
such
items
on
the
dresser
and
then
replaced
them
in
his
pockets
in
the
morning
but
he
could
remember
how
they
looked
on
the
dresser
the
notebook
had
been
there
among
them
now
that
he
came
to
think
of
it
when
had
he
seen
the
notebook
last
he
shown
it
to
lieutenant
lynch
during
the
afternoon
and
then
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
he
had
looked
for
it
again
so
it
had
to
be
somewhere
in
one
of
the
bars
he
visited
or
at
the
theater
where
he
and
dorothy
had
seen
hot
proud
of
himself
for
this
careful
and
complete
job
of
deduction
he
strolled
out
and
giving
boyd
and
the
one
small
smile
each
to
remember
him
by
he
went
into
the
sunlight
trying
to
decide
which
place
to
check
first
he
settled
on
the
theater
because
it
was
most
probable
after
all
people
were
always
losing
things
in
theaters
besides
if
he
started
at
the
theater
and
found
the
notebook
there
he
could
then
go
on
to
a
bar
to
celebrate
if
he
found
the
notebook
in
a
bar
he
did
much
relish
the
idea
of
going
on
to
an
empty
theater
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
to
celebrate
shaking
his
head
over
this
flimsy
structure
of
logic
he
headed
down
to
hot
he
banged
on
the
lobby
doors
for
a
while
without
any
good
result
and
finally
leaned
against
one
of
the
side
doors
which
opened
malone
fell
through
recovered
his
balance
and
found
himself
facing
an
old
bewhiskered
man
with
a
dustpan
a
broom
and
a
surprised
expression
i
looking
for
a
notebook
malone
said
try
a
stationery
store
youngster
the
old
man
said
i
thought

found
that

you
come
with
me
the
old
man
led
malone
in
silence
to
a
cave
deep
in
the
bowels
of
the
theater
where
he
went
behind
a
little
desk
took
up
a
pencil
as
if
it
were
a
club
held
it
poised
over
a
sheet
of
grimy
paper
and
said
name
malone
said

just

to
find
a
notebook

to
give
me

the
old
man
said
solemnly

rules

malone
sighed
kenneth
malone
he
said

old
man
fiercely
scribbling
looked

minute

said

ai

wrote

and
finally
said

said
wearily

days
before
somebody

theater

enough
and
you
find
that
out

spaniel

dog
before

talking
about

and
then
there
was
the
time
about
the
notebook
malone

the
old
man
said
i
lost
a
notebook
malone
said

was
hoping

old
man
said
and
poised
his
pencil
again
malone
heaved
a
great
sigh
black
plastic
he
said
about
so
big
he
made
motions
with
his
hands
no
names
or
initials
on
it
but
the
first
page
had
my
name
written
on
it
along
with
lieutenant

lynch
who

the
old
man
said

youngster
no

oh

said

the
old
man
said
i
busy
this
time
of
day
got
to
sweep
and
clean
got
work
to
do
not
like
you
tourists
with
difficulty
malone
leashed
his
temper
why
did
i
have
to
describe
the
notebook
he
said
you
have
got
any
notebooks
at
all
that
right
the
old
man
said
cheerfully
but
you
made
me
describe
that
the
rules
the
old
man
said
and
i
ai
about
to
go
against
the
rules
not
for
no
tourist
he
put
the
pencil
down
and
rose
wish
you
were
a
cop
he
said
i
never
met
a
cop
they
do
lose
things
like
people
do
making
a
mental
note
to
call
up
later
and
talk
to
the
manager
if
the
notebook
had
turned
up
in
the
meantime
malone
went
off
to
find
the
bars
he
had
stopped
in
before
the
theater
saving
topp
for
last
he
started
at
the
ad
lib
where
a
surprised
man
told
him
they
had
found
a
notebook
anywhere
in
the
bar
for
something
like
six
weeks
now
if
you
been
looking
for
umbrellas
he
said
we
could
have
accommodated
you
got
over
ten
umbrellas
downstairs
waiting
for
their
owners
i
wonder
why
people
lose
so
many
umbrellas
maybe
they
hate
rain
malone
said
i
do
know
the
bald
man
said
i
sort
of
a
psychologist
you
know
a
judge
of
people
i
think
it
an
unconscious
protest
against
the
fetters
of
a
society
which
is
slowly
strangling
them
by
malone
said
in
a
hurry
and
left
his
next
stop
was
the
xochitl
the
mexican
bar
on
street
he
greeted
the
bartender
warmly
ah
the
bartender
told
him
you

look
for
you
look
for
me
malone
said

black
plastic
book

big
and

the
bartender
said
and
shrugged

and
went
away

last
stop

topp

had
to
find
the
notebook
there
it
was
the
only
place
the
notebook
could
be

was
logic
and
malone
was
proud
of
it
he
walked
into
topp
trying
to
remember
the
bartender
name
and
found
it
just
as

walked
into
the
bar

here
yesterday
evening
between
six
and
eight
if
you
just
take
me
to
the
lost
and
found
one
moment
sir
ray
said
and
left
him
standing
at
the
bar
all
alone
in
a
few
seconds
he
was
back
i
did
see
the
notebook
myself
sir
he
said
but
if
wally
picked
it
up
he
have
turned
it
over
to
the
maître
d
perhaps
you
like
to
check
with
him
sure
malone
said
the
daytime
maître
d
turned
out
to
be
a
shortish
man
with
large
blue
eyes
a
silver
mane
and
a
thin
mustache
he
was
addressed
for
no
reason
malone
was
able
to
discover
as
beebee
ray
introduced
them
this
gentleman
wants
to
know
about
a
notebook
he
told
beebee
notebook
beebee
said
malone
explained
at
length
beebee
nodded
in
an
understanding
fashion
for
some
moments
and
when
malone
had
finished
disappeared
in
search
of
the
lost
and
found
he
came
back
rather
quickly
with
the
disturbing
news
that
no
notebook
was
anywhere
in
the
place
it
got
to
be
here
malone
said
well
beebee
said
it
is
maybe
you
left
it
some
place
else
maybe
it
home
now
it
is
malone
said
and
i
tried
every
place
else
new
york
a
big
city
malone
beebee
said
malone
sighed
i
tried
every
place
i
been
the
notebook
could
be
somewhere
i
have
been
a
rolling
stone
follows
its
owner
he
thought
about
that
it
did
seem
to
mean
anything
but
maybe
it
had
there
was
no
way
to
tell
for
sure
he
went
back
to
the
bar
to
think
things
over
and
figure
out
his
next
move
a
bourbon
and
soda
while
thinking
seemed
the
obvious
order
and
ray
bustled
off
to
get
it
had
he
left
the
notebook
on
the
street
somewhere
just
dropping
it
by
accident
malone
could
quite
see
that
happening
it
was
of
course
possible
but
the
possibility
was
so
remote
that
he
decided
to
try
and
think
of
everything
else
first
there
was
dorothy
for
instance
had
he
got
stewed
enough
so
that
he
showed
dorothy
the
notebook
he
did
remember
doing
it
and
he
did
quite
see
why
he
would
have
most
of
the
evening
was
more
or
less
clear
in
his
mind
he
had
apparently
forgotten
any
other
details
either
all
the
same
it
was
an
idea
he
decided
to
give
the
girl
a
call
and
find
out
for
sure
maybe
she
remembered
something
that
would
help
him
anyway
he
took
the
drink
from
ray
and
slid
off
the
bar
stool
two
steps
away
he
remembered
one
more
little
fact
he
did
have
her
number
and
he
did
know
anything
about
where
she
lived
except
that
it
could
be
reached
by
subway
that
malone
told
himself
morosely
limited
things
nicely
to
the
five
boroughs
of
new
york
and
she
said
she
was
living
with
her
aunt
would
she
have
a
phone
listing
under
her
own
name
or
would
the
listing
be
under
her
name
which
he
also
did
know
at
any
rate
he
could
check
listings
under
dorothy
francis
he
told
himself
he
did
so
there
were
lots
and
lots
of
people
named
dorothy
francis
in
manhattan
and
in
all
the
other
boroughs
malone
went
back
to
the
bar
to
think
some
more
he
was
on
his
second
bourbon
and
soda
still
thinking
but
without
any
new
ideas
when
beebee
tapped
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
pardon
me
the
maître
d
said
but
are
you
english
am
i
what
malone
said
spilling
a
little
of
his
drink
on
the
bar
are
you
english
beebee
said
oh
malone
said
no
irish
very
irish
that
nice
beebee
said
malone
stared
at
him
i
think
it
fine
he
said
but
i
love
to
know
why
you
asked
me
well
beebee
said
i
knew
you
could
be
american
not
after
the
phone
call
you
do
have
to
hide
your
nationality
here
we
quite
accustomed
to
foreign
visitors
and
we
do
have
special
prices
for
tourists
malone
waited
two
breaths
will
you
please
tell
me
he
said
slowly
what
it
is
you
talking
about
certainly
beebee
said
with
aplomb
there
a
call
for
you
in
the
upstairs
booth
a
call
personal
oh
malone
said
who
know
i
was
he
stopped
thinking
hard
there
was
no
way
for
anybody
in
the
world
to
know
he
was
in
topp
therefore
nobody
could
be
calling
him
they
got
the
wrong
name
he
said
decisively
oh
no
beebee
said
i
heard
them
quite
distinctly
you
sir
kenneth
malone
are
you
malone
gaped
for
one
long
second
and
then
his
mind
caught
up
with
the
facts
oh
he
said
sure
he
raced
upstairs
to
the
phone
booth
said
this
is
sir
kenneth
malone
into
the
blank
screen
and
waited
after
a
while
an
operator
said
call
sir
kenneth
from
yucca
flats
will
you
take
this
call
i
take
it
malone
said
a
face
appeared
on
the
screen
and
malone
knew
he
was
right
he
knew
exactly
how
he
been
located
and
by
whom
looking
only
at
the
face
in
the
screen
it
might
have
been
thought
that
the
woman
who
appeared
there
was
somebody
grandmother
kindly
and
perhaps
that
was
the
only
stereotype
she
could
have
been
an
schoolteacher
one
of
the
kindly
schoolteachers
who
taught
once
upon
a
time
that
never
was
in
the
little
red
schoolhouses
of
the
dim
past
the
face
positively
radiated
kindliness
and
friendship
and
peace
but
if
the
face
was
the
face
of
a
sentimental
dream
the
garb
was
the
garb
of
royalty
somebody
grandmother
was
on
her
way
to
a
costume
party
she
wore
the
full
court
costume
of
the
days
of
queen
elizabeth
i
complete
with
brocaded
velvet
gown
wide
ruff
collar
and
bejeweled
skullcap
she
was
malone
knew
completely
insane
like
all
the
other
telepaths
malone
and
the
rest
of
the
fbi
had
found
during
their
work
in
uncovering
a
telepathic
spy
she
had
been
located
in
an
insane
asylum
months
of
extensive
psychotherapy
including
all
the
newest
techniques
and
some
so
old
that
psychiatrists
were
a
little
afraid
to
use
them
had
done
absolutely
nothing
to
shake
the
firm
conviction
in
the
mind
of
miss
rose
thompson
she
was
she
insisted
elizabeth
tudor
rightful
queen
of
england
she
claimed
she
was
immortal
which
was
not
true
she
also
claimed
to
be
a
telepath
this
was
perfectly
accurate
it
had
been
her
help
that
had
enabled
malone
to
find
the
telepathic
spy
and
a
grateful
government
had
rewarded
her
it
had
given
her
a
special
expense
allotment
for
life
covering
the
clothing
she
wore
and
the
style
in
which
she
lived
rooms
had
been
set
aside
for
her
at
yucca
flats
and
she
held
court
there
sometimes
being
treated
by
psychiatrists
and
sometimes
helping
thomas
in
his
experiments
and
in
the
development
of
new
psionic
machines
she
was
probably
the
happiest
psychopath
on
earth
malone
stared
at
her
for
a
second
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
but
my
god
he
said
it
not
at
all
sir
kenneth
the
little
old
lady
said
your
queen
malone
took
a
deep
breath
good
afternoon
your
majesty
he
said
good
afternoon
sir
kenneth
she
said
and
waited
after
a
second
malone
figured
out
what
she
was
waiting
for
he
inclined
his
head
in
as
courtly
a
bow
as
he
could
manage
over
a
visiphone
i
am
deeply
honored
he
said
that
your
majesty
has
called
on
me
is
there
any
way
in
which
i
might
be
of
service
oh
goodness
me
no
said
the
little
old
lady
i
do
need
a
thing
they
do
one
very
well
here
in
yucca
flats
you
must
come
out
soon
and
see
my
new
throne
room
i
had
the
decorations
done
by
but
i
can
see
you
not
interested
in
that
sir
kenneth
but
malone
realized
it
was
useless
to
argue
with
the
old
lady
she
was
telepathic
and
knew
exactly
what
he
was
thinking
that
after
all
was
how
he
had
been
located
she
had
mentally
hunted
for
him
until
she
found
him
but
why
i
tell
you
why
sir
kenneth
the
little
old
lady
said
worried
about
you
worried
about
me
your
majesty
certainly
the
little
old
lady
said
inclining
her
head
just
the
proper
number
of
degrees
and
raising
it
again
you
sir
kenneth
and
that
silly
little
notebook
you
lost
you
been
stewing
about
it
for
the
last
hour
it
was
obvious
that
for
reasons
of
her
own
the
queen
had
seen
fit
to
look
into
malone
mind
she
found
him
worrying
and
called
him
about
it
it
was
malone
thought
sweet
of
her
in
a
way
but
it
was
also
just
a
bit
disconcerting
he
was
perfectly
well
aware
that
the
queen
could
read
his
mind
at
any
distance
but
unless
something
reminded
him
of
the
fact
he
have
to
think
about
it
and
he
did
like
to
think
about
it
do
be
disturbed
the
queen
said
please
i
only
want
to
help
you
sir
kenneth
you
know
that
well
of
course
i
do
malone
said
but
heavens
to
betsy
she
said
sir
kenneth
what
kind
of
a
detective
are
you
what
malone
said
and
added
at
once
your
majesty
he
knew
perfectly
well
of
course
that
miss
thompson
was
not
queen
elizabeth
i
and
he
knew
that
miss
thompson
knew
what
he
thought
but
she
did
mind
politeness
she
held
was
the
act
of
being
pleasant
on
the
surface
no
matter
what
a
person
really
thought
people
were
polite
to
their
bosses
she
pointed
out
even
though
they
were
perfectly
sure
that
they
could
do
a
better
job
than
the
bosses
were
doing
so
she
insisted
on
the
surface
pretense
that
malone
was
going
through
treating
her
like
a
queen
the
psychiatrists
had
called
her
delusion
a
beautifully
rationalized
one
as
far
as
malone
was
concerned
it
made
more
sense
than
most
of
real
life
that
very
nice
of
you
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
but
i
ask
you
again
what
kind
of
detective
are
you
have
you
got
any
common
sense
at
all
malone
hated
to
admit
it
but
he
had
always
had
just
that
suspicion
after
all
he
was
a
very
good
detective
he
was
just
lucky
his
luck
had
enabled
him
to
break
a
lot
of
tough
cases
but
some
day
people
would
find
out
and
then
well
the
queen
said
at
the
very
least
you
ought
to
like
a
detective
she
sniffed
audibly
sir
kenneth
i
ashamed
that
a
member
of
my
own
fbi
ca
do
any
better
than
you
doing
now
malone
blinked
into
the
screen
he
did
feel
ashamed
in
a
vague
sort
of
way
and
he
was
willing
to
admit
it
but
he
did
feel
wistfully
that
it
would
be
nice
to
know
just
what
he
was
being
ashamed
of
have
i
been
missing
something
he
said
outside
of
the
obvious
the
queen
said
that
you
been
missing
your
notebook
or
rather
mike
fueyo
notebook
yes
malone
said
you
certainly
have
the
queen
said
do
you
see
what
happened
to
that
notebook
you
been
missing
the
only
possible
explanation
but
there
is
any
malone
said
unless
miss
francis
has
it
her
majesty
gave
him
a
bright
smile
there
she
said
there
what
malone
said
i
knew
you
could
do
it
the
queen
said
all
you
had
to
do
was
apply
your
intelligence
and
you
come
up
with
just
the
fact
you
needed
what
fact
malone
said
that
miss
francis
has
your
notebook
the
queen
said
you
just
told
me
all
right
malone
said
and
stopped
and
took
a
deep
breath
my
god
he
said
after
a
pause
what
is
that
supposed
to
mean
did
i
give
it
to
her
after
all
no
the
queen
said
did
i
lose
it
and
did
she
pick
it
up
no
the
queen
said
my
god
malone
said
again
all
right
i
give
up
is
this
twenty
questions
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
what
a
way
to
talk
to
your
queen
malone
took
another
breath
i
sorry
he
muttered
but
yes
i
know
the
queen
said
sympathetically
you
upset
but
you
did
give
miss
francis
the
notebook
and
she
did
find
it
after
you
lost
it
then
malone
stared
she
stole
it
she
stole
it
from
me
i
imagine
she
took
it
right
from
your
jacket
pocket
the
queen
said
now
if
you
only
wear
proper
clothing
and
a
proper
pouch
at
your
belt
i
be
stared
at
malone
said
in
court
clothing
no
one
in
new
york
would
stare
at
you
the
queen
said
they
think
it
was
what
they
call
an
advertising
stunt
anyhow
malone
said
i
was
wearing
court
clothing
so
that
made
it
easy
for
her
to
steal
the
notebook
but
why
for
god
sake
why
because
the
queen
said
she
needed
it
needed
it
malone
shrieked
please
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
do
talk
to
your
sovereign
in
that
manner
and
i
do
wish
you
stop
thinking
of
that
girl
as
dorothy
francis
she
is
at
all
you
know
no
malone
said
i
do
know
if
she
is
dorothy
francis
who
in
hell
is
she
do
swear
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
she
dorothea
francisca
fueyo
if
you
want
to
know
malone
gulped
then
she
that
right
the
queen
said
she
little
miguel
fueyo
older
sister
malone
put
in
a
great
deal
of
time
he
imagined
just
staring
at
the
face
of
the
little
old
lady
on
the
screen
at
last
he
spoke
my
god
he
said
her
name
is
fueyo
i
be
damned
i
told
you
the
queen
said
with
some
asperity
not
to
swear
sir
kenneth
i
know
malone
said
but
you
excited
the
queen
said
you
stunned
goodness
you
need
to
tell
me
that
sir
kenneth
i
know
but
she
malone
discovered
that
he
could
talk
he
swallowed
a
couple
of
times
and
then
went
on
she
mike
fueyo
sister
that
exactly
right
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
that
just
what
i
told
you
then
she
swiped
the
book
to
protect
her
little
brother
malone
said
oh
boy
exactly
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
and
she
does
care
about
me
at
all
malone
said
i
mean
she
only
went
out
with
me
because
i
was
me
malone
and
she
wanted
the
notebook
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
he
added
an
expletive
the
queen
frowned
but
said
nothing
about
it
i
would
say
that
if
i
were
you
she
went
on
quite
the
contrary
she
does
like
you
you
know
and
she
thinks
you
a
very
nice
person
the
queen
beamed
you
are
you
know
she
said
oh
malone
said
uncomfortably
sure
you
do
have
to
think
that
she
merely
went
out
with
you
because
of
her
brother
notebook
the
queen
said
but
she
does
have
a
strong
sense
of
loyalty
and
he
is
her
younger
brother
after
all
he
sure
is
malone
said
he
a
great
kid
little
mike
you
see
the
queen
continued
imperturbably
mike
told
her
about
losing
the
notebook
the
other
night
when
he
struck
you
when
he
struck
me
malone
said
oh
yes
he
struck
me
all
right
he
guessed
that
you
must
have
it
when
you
started
asking
questions
about
the
silent
spooks
you
see
the
queen
said
that
was
the
only
way
you
could
have
found
out
about
him
unless
you
were
telepathic
which
of
course
you
not
no
malone
said
now
understand
me
the
queen
said
i
do
not
think
that
his
striking
you
was
a
very
nice
act
i
do
either
malone
said
it
hurt
like
it
hurt
quite
a
lot
certainly
the
queen
said
but
he
did
hurt
the
car
any
and
he
did
want
to
he
just
wanted
to
ride
around
in
it
for
a
while
he
likes
red
cadillacs
malone
said
oh
yes
the
queen
said
he
thinks
they
wonderful
good
for
him
malone
said
sourly
well
now
the
queen
said
you
just
go
right
on
over
to
her
house
of
course
she
does
live
with
an
aunt
no
malone
said
she
lives
with
mike
and
his
mother
why
not
the
queen
said
she
part
of
the
family
malone
nodded
silently
she
give
you
the
book
sir
kenneth
i
just
know
that
she
will
and
i
want
you
to
be
very
nice
to
her
when
you
ask
for
it
she
a
very
nice
girl
you
know
she
a
swell
girl
malone
said
morosely
and
i
hey
wait
a
minute
yes
sir
kenneth
how
come
you
can
read
her
thoughts
malone
said
and
mike
i
thought
you
had
to
know
somebody
pretty
well
before
you
could
read
them
at
a
distance
like
this
do
you
know
them
i
mean
oh
no
the
queen
said
but
i
can
read
of
course
malone
could
see
that
the
queen
was
trying
very
hard
not
to
look
proud
of
herself
and
last
night
she
went
on
you
two
were
well
sir
kenneth
you
had
a
real
with
each
other
my
goodness
yes
well
malone
said
we
do
explain
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
it
really
necessary
i
thought
it
was
very
sweet
and
in
any
case
i
can
pick
her
up
now
because
of
that
rapport
not
quite
as
well
as
i
can
pick
you
up
but
enough
to
get
the
strong
surface
thoughts
oh
malone
said
but
mike
i
ca
pick
him
up
at
all
this
far
away
the
queen
said
there
is
just
a
faint
touch
of
him
though
through
the
girl
but
all
i
know
about
him
is
what
she
thinks
she
smiled
gently
he
a
nice
boy
basically
she
said
sure
he
is
malone
said
he
got
a
nice
blackjack
too
basically
he
grimaced
were
you
reading
my
mind
all
last
night
he
said
well
the
queen
said
no
toward
morning
you
were
getting
so
fuzzy
i
just
did
bother
i
can
understand
that
malone
said
i
nearly
did
bother
myself
the
queen
nodded
but
toward
afternoon
she
said
i
did
have
anything
to
do
so
i
just
listened
in
you
do
have
such
a
nice
mind
sir
kenneth
so
refreshing
and
different
especially
when
you
in
love
malone
blushed
quietly
oh
i
know
the
queen
said
you
much
rather
think
of
yourself
as
a
sort
of
apprentice
lecher
a
kind
of
cynical
don
juan
but
i
know
malone
said
do
tell
me
about
it
all
right
of
course
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
if
you
wish
it
basically
i
a
nice
boy
malone
said
sure
i
am
he
paused
do
you
have
any
more
pertinent
information
your
majesty
not
right
now
the
queen
admitted
but
if
i
do
i
let
you
know
she
giggled
you
know
i
had
to
argue
awfully
hard
with
hatterer
to
get
to
use
the
telephone
she
said
i
bet
malone
said
but
i
did
manage
she
said
and
winked
i
wo
have
that
sort
of
trouble
again
malone
wondered
briefly
what
dark
secret
hatterer
had
that
her
majesty
had
discovered
in
his
mind
and
used
to
blackmail
him
with
at
last
he
decided
that
it
was
probably
none
of
his
business
and
matter
too
much
anyway
quite
right
sir
kenneth
the
queen
said
and
good
bye
for
now
your
majesty
malone
said
he
bowed
again
and
flipped
off
the
phone
bowing
in
a
phone
booth
was
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
to
do
he
thought
to
himself
but
somehow
he
had
managed
it
he
reached
into
his
pocket
for
a
moment
that
it
was
an
elizabethan
talks
with
her
majesty
always
had
that
effect
after
a
time
malone
came
to
believe
in
the
strange
bright
world
but
he
shook
off
the
lingering
effects
of
her
psychosis
fished
out
some
coins
and
thought
for
a
minute
so
dorothy
dorothea
had
lifted
the
notebook
that
was
some
help
certainly
it
let
him
know
something
more
about
the
enemy
he
was
facing
but
it
was
really
a
lot
of
help
what
did
he
do
now
her
majesty
had
suggested
going
to
the
fueyo
house
collaring
the
girl
but
treating
her
nicely
malone
reminded
himself
and
demanding
the
book
back
she
even
said
he
would
get
the
book
back
and
since
she
knew
some
of
what
went
on
in
dorothea
fueyo
mind
she
was
probably
right
but
what
good
was
that
going
to
do
him
he
knew
everything
that
was
in
the
book
getting
it
back
was
something
that
could
wait
it
did
sound
particularly
profitable
and
it
did
even
sound
like
fun
what
he
needed
was
a
next
move
he
thought
for
a
minute
dropped
the
coins
into
the
phone
and
dialed
the
number
of
the
police
commissioner
office
after
a
brief
argument
with
a
secretary
he
had
fernack
on
the
phone
and
this
time
malone
told
himself
he
was
going
to
be
polite
if
possible
good
afternoon
john
henry
he
said
sunnily
when
the
face
was
finally
on
the
screen
can
you
get
me
some
more
information
fernack
stared
at
him
sourly
depends
he
said
on
what
malone
said
telling
himself
he
was
going
to
get
irritated
and
knowing
perfectly
well
that
he
was
lying
on
what
kind
of
information
you
want
fernack
said
well
malone
said
there
a
warehouse
i
want
to
know
some
more
about
who
the
owner
is
for
one
thing
and
fernack
nodded
i
got
it
he
said
he
fished
around
on
his
desk
and
brought
up
a
sheet
of
paper
he
held
it
up
to
the
screen
while
malone
copied
off
the
name
and
address
lieutenant
lynch
told
me
all
about
it
lynch
malone
said
but
he
lynch
works
for
me
malone
fernack
said
remember
that
but
he
said
he
he
said
he
would
do
anything
and
he
wo
fernack
said
he
just
reported
it
to
me
for
my
action
he
knew
i
was
working
with
you
malone
and
i
am
his
boss
remember
great
malone
said
now
john
henry
hold
it
malone
fernack
said
i
like
a
little
information
too
you
know
i
like
to
know
just
what
the
hell
is
going
on
if
it
too
much
trouble
it
not
that
john
henry
malone
said
earnestly
really
it
just
that
i
all
this
about
vanishing
boys
fernack
said
disappearing
into
thin
air
all
this
nonsense
it
is
nonsense
malone
said
all
right
fernack
said
indulgently
boys
disappear
every
day
like
that
sure
they
do
he
leaned
toward
the
screen
and
his
voice
was
as
hard
as
his
face
malone
are
these
kids
mixed
up
with
those
impossible
robberies
you
had
me
looking
up
well
malone
said
i
think
so
but
i
doubt
if
you
could
prove
it
fernack
face
had
begun
its
slow
climb
toward
purple
again
malone
he
said
if
you
suppressing
evidence
even
if
you
are
the
fbi
i
i
not
suppressing
any
evidence
malone
said
i
do
think
could
prove
a
connection
i
do
think
could
prove
a
connection
i
do
think
could
not
right
now
fernack
leaned
back
apparently
mollified
john
henry
malone
said
i
want
to
ask
you
to
keep
your
hands
off
this
case
to
let
me
handle
it
my
way
fernack
nodded
absently
sure
malone
he
said
what
i
said
sure
fernack
said
is
that
what
you
wanted
well
yes
malone
said
but
fernack
leaned
all
the
way
back
in
his
chair
his
face
a
mask
of
disappointment
and
frustration
malone
he
said
i
wish
i
never
heard
of
this
case
i
wish
i
been
retired
or
died
before
it
ever
came
up
i
been
a
police
officer
in
new
york
for
a
long
time
and
i
wish
this
case
had
waited
a
few
more
years
to
happen
he
stopped
malone
leaned
against
the
back
wall
of
the
phone
booth
and
lit
a
cigarette
andy
burris
called
me
less
than
half
an
hour
ago
fernack
said
oh
malone
said
that
right
fernack
said
good
old
burris
of
the
fbi
and
he
told
me
this
was
a
national
security
case
national
security
it
your
baby
malone
because
burris
wants
it
that
way
he
snorted
so
worry
about
me
he
said
i
just
here
to
the
patriotic
loyal
dumb
slave
of
a
grateful
government
malone
blew
out
a
plume
of
smoke
you
know
john
henry
he
said
you
might
have
made
a
good
fbi
man
yourself
you
got
the
right
attitude
never
mind
the
jokes
fernack
said
bitterly
okay
malone
said
but
tell
me
did
you
actually
make
arrangements
for
me
to
get
into
that
warehouse
i
suppose
you
know
that
what
i
want
i
guessed
that
much
fernack
said
i
have
made
any
arrangements
at
all
yet
but
i
will
i
have
safe
and
loft
get
the
keys
and
a
full
set
of
floor
plans
to
the
place
while
they
at
it
will
that
do
your
majesty
malone
choked
on
his
smoke
and
shot
a
quick
look
over
his
shoulder
there
was
nothing
there
but
the
wall
of
the
booth
queen
elizabeth
i
was
nowhere
in
evidence
then
he
realized
that
fernack
had
been
talking
to
him
do
that
he
said
what
fernack
said
malone
realized
in
one
awful
second
how
strange
the
explanation
was
going
to
sound
could
he
say
that
he
thought
he
been
mistaken
for
an
old
friend
of
his
elizabeth
tudor
could
he
say
that
he
just
had
a
call
from
her
in
the
end
he
merely
said
nothing
and
let
it
go
at
that
well
anyhow
fernack
said
do
you
want
anything
else
not
right
now
malone
said
i
let
you
know
though
and
thanks
john
henry
no
matter
why
you
doing
this
thanks
i
do
deserve
fernack
muttered
and
i
hope
you
get
caught
in
some
kind
of
deadfall
and
have
to
come
screaming
to
the
cops
that
malone
reflected
was
the
second
time
a
cop
had
suggested
his
yelling
if
he
got
into
trouble
had
the
police
force
ever
heard
of
telephones
he
said
and
flipped
off
then
he
stared
at
the
screen
for
a
little
while
as
his
cigarette
burned
down
between
his
fingers
at
last
he
put
the
cigarette
out
and
went
downstairs
again
to
the
bar
if
he
had
to
do
some
heavy
thinking
he
told
himself
there
was
absolutely
no
reason
why
he
could
enjoy
himself
a
little
while
doing
it
the
evening
rush
had
begun
and
malone
found
himself
a
stool
simply
by
slipping
into
one
while
a
drinker
back
was
turned
once
ensconced
he
huddled
himself
up
like
an
old
drunk
thus
effectively
cutting
himself
off
from
interruptions
and
lit
another
cigarette
ray
was
down
at
the
other
end
of
the
bar
chatting
with
a
woman
and
her
pale
bald
escort
malone
sighed
and
set
himself
to
the
job
of
serious
constructive
thinking
he
asked
himself
you
go
about
catching
a
person
who
can
vanish
away
like
so
much
smoke
well
malone
could
think
of
one
solution
but
it
was
pretty
bloody
nailing
the
kids
to
a
wall
would
probably
work
but
he
could
say
much
else
for
it
there
had
to
be
another
way
out
for
some
reason
malone
just
could
see
himself
with
a
mouthful
of
nails
a
hammer
and
a
it
sounded
just
a
little
too
messy
then
of
course
there
were
handcuffs
that
sounded
a
little
better
the
trouble
was
that
malone
simply
did
have
enough
information
and
knew
it
obviously
the
kids
could
carry
stuff
with
them
when
they
teleported
the
stuff
they
stole
proved
that
and
their
clothes
malone
added
apparently
the
kids
did
arrive
at
wherever
they
went
stark
staring
naked
but
how
close
to
a
teleport
did
the
things
he
carried
have
to
be
in
other
words
malone
thought
if
you
put
handcuffs
on
a
teleport
would
the
handcuffs
vanish
when
the
teleport
did
and
did
that
include
the
part
of
the
cuff
you
were
holding
what
happened
if
you
snapped
half
the
cuff
around
your
own
wrist
first
did
you
go
along
with
the
teleport
or
did
your
wrist
go
while
you
stayed
behind
and
wondered
how
long
it
would
take
to
bleed
to
death
or
what
all
the
questions
were
intriguing
ones
malone
sighed
wishing
he
knew
the
answer
to
even
one
of
them
it
was
somewhat
comforting
to
think
that
he
managed
to
progress
a
little
anyway
the
kids
had
meant
anybody
to
find
out
about
them
but
malone
had
found
out
about
them
and
alerted
all
the
cops
in
town
as
well
as
the
rest
of
the
fbi
he
knew
just
who
they
were
and
where
they
lived
and
how
they
performed
the
miracles
they
performed
anyhow
he
knew
something
about
that
last
item
he
even
knew
who
had
his
notebook
he
tabled
that
thought
and
went
back
to
feeling
victorious
within
a
few
seconds
the
sense
of
achievement
was
gone
and
futility
had
come
in
its
place
after
all
he
still
did
know
how
to
catch
the
kids
did
he
no
he
thought
about
handcuffs
some
more
and
then
gave
up
he
just
have
to
try
it
and
see
how
it
worked
and
if
the
teleports
took
his
wrist
away
he
he
go
after
them
and
make
them
give
it
back
sure
he
would
that
reminded
him
of
the
notebook
again
and
since
the
thing
was
being
so
persistent
he
decided
he
might
as
well
pay
some
attention
to
it
dorothea
had
the
notebook
malone
tried
to
see
himself
barging
in
on
her
and
asking
for
it
and
he
did
care
for
the
picture
at
all
no
matter
how
good
queen
bess
felt
about
it
after
all
she
thought
mike
fueyo
was
basically
a
nice
kid
so
what
did
she
know
he
closed
his
eyes
there
he
was
in
the
fueyo
apartment
talking
to
dorothea
dorothea
he
muttered
you
filched
my
notebook
that
did
sound
very
effective
and
besides
it
was
really
his
notebook
he
tried
again
dorothea
you
pinched
your
brother
notebook
now
for
some
reason
it
sounded
like
something
covered
by
the
vice
squad
it
sounded
terrible
but
there
were
other
ways
of
saying
the
same
thing
dorothea
he
muttered
you
borrowed
your
brother
notebook
that
was
too
patronizing
malone
told
himself
that
he
sounded
like
a
character
straight
out
of
screens
and
settled
himself
gamely
for
another
try
dorothea
you
your
brother
notebook
to
which
the
obvious
answer
was
yes
i
do
and
so
what
or
possibly
how
do
you
know
and
malone
thought
about
answering
that
one
queen
elizabeth
told
me
was
the
literal
truth
but
somehow
it
did
sound
like
it
and
he
could
find
another
answer
to
give
the
girl
dorothea
he
said
and
a
voice
from
nowhere
added
will
you
have
another
drink
damn
it
malone
exploded
that
not
the
question
drinks
have
nothing
to
do
with
notebooks
it
notebooks
i
after
ca
you
understand
belatedly
he
looked
up
there
was
ray
the
barman
oh
he
said
i
just
came
over
ray
said
and
i
figured
if
you
could
find
your
notebook
maybe
you
like
a
drink
so
long
as
you
here
ray
malone
said
with
feeling
you
are
an
eminently
reasonable
fellow
i
accept
your
solution
nay
more
i
endorse
your
solution
wholeheartedly
ray
went
off
to
mix
and
malone
stared
after
him
happily
this
was
really
a
nice
place
he
reflected
almost
as
nice
as
the
city
hall
bar
in
chicago
where
he
gone
long
ago
with
his
father
but
he
tore
his
mind
away
from
the
happy
past
and
concentrated
instead
on
the
miserable
present
he
decided
for
the
last
time
that
he
was
not
going
to
ask
dorothea
for
the
book
not
just
yet
anyhow
after
all
it
was
as
if
he
needed
the
book
he
knew
his
own
name
and
he
knew
lynch
name
and
he
knew
the
names
on
the
second
page
and
he
did
see
any
particular
need
for
a
picture
of
a
red
cadillac
no
matter
how
nicely
colored
it
was
so
he
asked
himself
why
embarrass
everybody
by
trying
to
get
it
back
of
course
it
technically
a
crime
to
pick
pockets
and
that
went
double
or
triple
for
the
pockets
of
fbi
agents
but
malone
told
himself
that
he
did
feel
like
pressing
charges
anyhow
and
dorothy
probably
did
make
a
habit
of
he
sighed
and
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
fifteen
minutes
of
six
now
he
knew
what
his
next
move
was
going
to
be
he
was
going
to
go
back
to
his
hotel
and
change
his
clothes
that
is
he
amended
as
soon
as
he
finished
the
drink
that
ray
was
setting
up
in
front
of
him
by
the
time
malone
reached
the
hotel
new
yorker
it
was
malone
had
reckoned
with
new
york
traffic
and
after
seeing
it
he
still
did
believe
it
finding
a
cab
had
been
impossible
and
he
had
started
for
the
subway
hoping
that
he
get
lost
and
end
up
somewhere
in
brooklyn
but
one
look
at
the
shrieking
mob
trying
to
sardine
itself
into
the
seventh
avenue
subway
entrance
had
convinced
him
it
was
better
to
walk
bucking
the
street
crowds
was
bad
enough
bucking
the
subway
crowds
was
something
malone
did
even
want
to
think
about
he
let
himself
into
his
room
and
was
taking
off
his
shoes
with
a
grateful
sigh
when
there
was
a
rap
on
the
door
of
the
bathroom
that
connected
his
room
with
boyd
malone
padded
over
to
the
door
his
shoes
in
one
hand
tom
he
said
you
are
expecting
maybe
titus
moody
boyd
called
okay
malone
said
come
on
in
boyd
pushed
open
the
door
he
was
stripped
to
the
waist
a
state
of
dress
which
showed
the
largest
expanse
of
chest
malone
had
ever
seen
and
he
was
carrying
the
small
scissors
which
he
used
to
trim
his
henry
viii
beard
he
stabbed
the
scissors
toward
malone
who
shuffled
back
hurriedly
listen
boyd
said
did
you
call
the
office
after
you
left
this
afternoon
no
malone
admitted
why
what
happened
there
was
a
call
for
you
boyd
said
long
distance
just
before
i
left
at
five
i
came
on
back
to
the
hotel
and
waited
until
i
heard
you
come
in
thought
you
might
want
to
know
about
it
i
do
i
guess
malone
said
who
from
looking
at
boyd
a
henry
viii
the
association
was
too
obvious
to
be
missed
malone
thought
of
good
queen
bess
and
wondered
why
she
was
calling
him
again
and
more
surprising
why
she
called
him
at
fbi
headquarters
when
she
must
have
known
that
he
was
there
boyd
said
oh
malone
said
somewhat
relieved
at
yucca
flats
boyd
nodded
right
he
said
you
to
call
operator
nine
thanks
malone
went
over
to
the
phone
remembered
his
shoes
and
put
them
down
carefully
on
the
floor
anything
else
of
importance
he
asked
on
the
cadillacs
boyd
said
we
got
a
final
report
now
leibowitz
and
hardin
finally
finished
checking
the
last
of
them
there
were
quite
as
many
as
we
were
afraid
there
were
going
to
be
red
is
a
very
popular
color
around
here
good
malone
said
and
there
is
a
doggone
thing
on
any
of
boyd
said
oh
we
cleared
up
a
lot
of
crime
one
thing
and
another
but
that
about
all
no
such
thing
as
an
brain
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
lot
leibowitz
says
he
willing
to
swear
to
it
malone
sighed
i
did
think
he
find
one
he
said
you
did
no
malone
said
boyd
stabbed
at
him
with
the
scissors
again
then
why
did
you
cause
all
that
trouble
he
said
because
i
thought
we
might
find
brains
malone
said
wearily
or
one
anyhow
but
you
just
said
malone
picked
up
the
phone
got
long
distance
and
motioned
boyd
to
silence
in
one
sweeping
series
of
moves
the
operator
said
yes
sir
may
we
help
you
give
me
operator
nine
malone
said
there
was
a
buzz
a
click
and
a
new
voice
which
said
operator
may
we
help
you
all
nine
of
you
malone
muttered
never
mind
this
is
kenneth
malone
i
got
a
call
from
thomas
at
yucca
flats
please
connect
me
there
was
another
buzz
a
click
and
an
ungodly
howl
which
was
followed
by
the
voice
of
operator
saying
we
are
connecting
you
there
will
be
a
slight
delay
we
are
malone
waited
at
last
there
was
another
small
howl
and
the
screen
lit
up
face
as
stern
and
ascetic
as
ever
stared
through
at
malone
i
understand
you
called
me
malone
said
ah
yes
said
it
very
good
to
see
you
again
mr
malone
he
gave
malone
a
smile
good
for
exchange
at
your
corner
grocery
worth
one
icicle
it
good
to
see
you
too
malone
lied
burris
explained
to
me
what
it
was
that
you
wanted
to
talk
to
me
about
said
am
i
to
understand
that
you
have
actually
found
a
teleport
unless
my
theories
are
away
off
malone
said
i
done
a
lot
better
than
that
i
found
eight
of
them
eight
smile
grew
perceptibly
warmer
it
now
stood
at
about
degrees
fahrenheit
that
is
really
excellent
malone
you
have
done
a
fine
job
thanks
malone
muttered
he
wished
that
did
make
him
feel
quite
so
much
like
a
law
student
talking
to
an
egomaniacal
professor
when
can
you
deliver
them
said
well
malone
said
carefully
that
depends
seemed
to
view
the
teleports
as
pieces
of
equipment
he
thought
i
deliver
them
until
i
catch
them
he
said
and
that
why
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
some
slight
delay
said
will
be
quite
understandable
his
face
left
no
doubt
that
he
did
like
the
necessity
of
understanding
anything
that
was
going
to
keep
him
and
the
eight
teleports
apart
for
even
thirty
seconds
longer
now
that
he
knew
about
them
you
see
malone
said
they
kids
juvenile
delinquents
or
something
like
that
but
they
are
teleports
that
for
sure
i
see
said
so
we
got
to
nab
them
malone
said
and
for
that
i
need
all
the
information
i
can
get
nodded
slowly
i
be
happy
he
said
to
give
you
any
information
i
can
provide
malone
took
a
deep
breath
and
plunged
how
does
this
teleportation
bit
work
anyhow
he
said
you
asked
a
very
delicate
question
said
actually
we
ca
be
quite
positive
his
expression
showed
just
how
little
he
wanted
to
make
this
admission
however
he
went
on
brightening
there
is
some
evidence
which
seems
to
show
that
it
is
basically
the
same
process
as
psychokinesis
and
we
do
have
quite
a
bit
of
empirical
data
on
psychokinesis
he
scribbled
something
on
a
sheet
of
paper
and
said
for
instance
there
this
he
held
the
paper
up
to
the
screen
so
that
malone
could
read
it
it
said
malone
looked
at
it
for
some
seconds
at
last
he
said
it
very
pretty
what
the
hell
is
it
this
said
in
a
condescending
tone
of
voice
that
meant
you
should
have
known
all
along
but
you
just
hopeless
is
the
basic
formula
for
the
phenomenon
where
is
the
mass
in
grams
is
the
distance
in
centimeters
is
the
force
in
dynes
and
is
the
time
in
seconds
is
a
constant
whose
value
is
not
yet
known
and
the
numeral
is
unity
malone
said
hmm
and
stared
at
the
equation
again
somehow
the
explanation
was
not
very
helpful
the
numeral
was
unity
he
understood
that
much
all
right
but
it
did
seem
to
do
him
any
good
as
you
can
see
went
on
the
greater
the
force
and
the
longer
time
it
is
applied
the
greater
distance
any
given
mass
can
be
moved
or
contrariwise
the
more
mass
the
greater
mass
that
is
the
easier
it
is
to
move
it
any
given
distance
this
is
as
you
undoubtedly
understand
not
at
all
in
contradistinction
to
physical
phenomena
ah
malone
said
feeling
that
something
was
expected
of
him
but
not
being
quite
sure
what
frowned
i
must
admit
he
said
that
the
uncertainty
as
to
the
constant
and
the
lack
of
any
real
knowledge
as
to
just
what
kind
of
force
is
being
applied
have
held
up
our
work
so
far
then
his
face
smoothed
out
of
course
when
we
have
the
teleports
to
work
with
we
may
derive
a
full
set
of
laws
which
never
mind
that
now
malone
said
but
our
work
is
most
important
malone
said
with
a
motion
of
his
eyebrows
as
i
sure
you
must
understand
oh
malone
said
feeling
if
he
been
caught
without
his
homework
of
course
but
if
you
do
mind
yes
mr
malone
said
smoothly
what
i
want
to
know
malone
said
is
this
what
are
the
limitations
of
this
uh
phenomenon
brightened
up
thoroughly
well
theoretically
he
said
there
do
not
appear
to
be
any
limitations
however
practical
limitations
do
exist
if
the
process
is
at
all
parallel
with
psychokinesis
or
with
levitation
he
stared
at
malone
as
if
daring
him
to
say
that
it
was
if
that
parallel
exists
then
the
subject
is
mentally
limited
by
his
own
physical
strength
malone
said
what
try
and
be
patient
malone
said
calmly
please
as
i
was
saying
the
subject
is
limited
by
his
own
physical
strength
in
other
words
he
can
not
move
psionically
any
subject
larger
than
he
can
lift
physically
this
appears
to
be
a
psychological
limitation
which
oh
malone
said
you
mean
he
could
carry
off
a
building
or
anything
like
that
of
course
not
said
nor
as
a
matter
of
fact
could
he
carry
off
anything
that
was
securely
bolted
down
i
hope
you
follow
me
i
think
so
malone
said
but
look
here
suppose
you
handcuffed
him
to
say
a
radiator
or
a
jail
cell
bar
yes
could
he
get
appeared
to
consider
this
with
some
care
well
he
said
at
last
he
certainly
could
take
the
radiator
with
him
or
the
cell
bar
if
that
what
you
mean
he
hesitated
looked
slightly
shamefaced
and
then
went
on
but
you
must
realize
that
we
lack
any
really
extensive
data
on
this
phenomenon
of
course
malone
said
that
why
i
so
very
anxious
to
get
those
subjects
said
malone
said
earnestly
that
just
what
i
had
in
mind
from
the
start
i
been
going
to
a
lot
of
extra
trouble
to
make
sure
that
those
kids
do
get
killed
or
end
up
in
reform
schools
or
something
just
so
you
could
work
with
them
i
appreciate
that
malone
said
gravely
malone
felt
as
if
someone
had
given
him
a
gold
star
fighting
down
the
emotion
he
went
on
i
know
right
now
that
i
can
catch
one
or
two
of
them
but
i
do
know
for
sure
that
i
can
hold
one
for
more
than
a
fraction
of
a
second
i
see
your
problem
said
believe
me
malone
i
do
see
your
problem
and
is
there
a
way
out
malone
said
i
mean
a
way
i
can
hold
on
to
them
for
at
present
said
heavily
i
have
no
suggestions
i
lack
data
oh
fine
malone
said
we
need
the
kids
to
get
the
data
and
we
need
the
data
to
get
the
kids
he
sighed
hooray
for
our
side
he
added
there
does
appear
to
be
something
of
a
dilemma
here
admitted
sadly
dilemma
is
putting
it
mildly
malone
said
opened
his
mouth
shut
it
opened
it
again
and
said
i
agree
well
malone
said
maybe
one
of
us
will
think
of
something
if
anything
does
occur
to
you
let
me
know
at
once
i
certainly
will
said
believe
me
malone
i
want
you
to
capture
those
kids
just
as
badly
as
you
want
to
capture
them
yourself
i
try
malone
said
at
random
he
flipped
off
and
turned
with
a
sense
of
relief
back
to
boyd
but
it
looked
as
if
henry
viii
had
been
hit
on
the
head
with
a
cow
or
something
equally
weighty
boyd
looked
and
slightly
stunned
what
the
matter
with
you
malone
said
sick
i
not
sick
boyd
said
carefully
at
least
i
do
think
i
sick
it
hard
to
tell
what
wrong
teleporting
boyd
said
juvenile
delinquents
malone
felt
a
sudden
twinge
in
the
area
of
his
conscience
he
realized
that
he
had
told
boyd
nothing
at
all
about
what
had
been
going
on
since
the
discovery
of
the
notebook
two
nights
ago
he
filled
his
partner
in
rapidly
while
boyd
stood
in
front
of
the
mirror
and
rather
shakily
attempted
to
trim
his
beard
that
why
i
had
the
car
search
continue
malone
said
i
was
fairly
sure
the
fault
was
in
the
cars
but
the
boys
but
i
had
to
make
absolutely
sure
boyd
said
oh
chopped
a
small
section
out
of
the
center
of
his
beard
and
added
damn
my
hand
shaky
well
malone
said
that
the
story
it
a
hell
of
a
story
boyd
said
and
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
do
believe
it
because
i
do
it
true
malone
said
that
does
affect
me
boyd
said
i
go
along
with
the
gag
but
enough
is
enough
vanishing
teenagers
ridiculous
just
so
you
go
along
with
me
malone
said
oh
i
go
along
boyd
said
this
is
my
vacation
too
is
it
what
the
next
move
mastermind
we
going
down
to
that
warehouse
malone
said
decisively
got
a
hunch
the
kids
have
been
hiding
there
ever
since
they
left
their
homes
yesterday
malone
boyd
said
what
you
mean
we
going
down
to
the
warehouse
boyd
said
malone
nodded
i
might
have
known
boyd
said
i
might
have
known
tom
malone
said
what
wrong
oh
nothing
boyd
said
nothing
at
all
everything
fine
and
dandy
i
think
i
going
to
commit
suicide
but
do
let
that
bother
you
what
happened
malone
said
boyd
stared
at
him
you
happened
he
said
you
and
the
and
the
bloody
damn
warehouse
happened
three
days
work
ruined
malone
scratched
his
head
found
out
that
his
head
still
hurt
and
put
his
hand
down
again
what
work
he
said
for
three
days
boyd
said
i
been
taking
this
blonde
chick
all
over
new
york
wining
her
dining
her
spending
money
as
if
i
were
burris
himself
instead
of
the
common
or
garden
variety
of
fbi
agent
night
clubs
theaters
bars
the
works
malone
we
were
getting
along
famously
it
was
wonderful
and
tonight
malone
said
tonight
boyd
said
was
supposed
to
be
the
night
the
big
night
the
payoff
we
got
a
date
for
dinner
steak
two
inches
thick
with
mushrooms
at
her
apartment
malone
she
will
probably
you
have
to
break
it
malone
said
sympathetically
too
bad
but
it
ca
be
helped
now
you
can
pick
up
a
sandwich
before
you
go
a
sandwich
boyd
said
with
great
dignity
is
not
my
idea
of
something
to
eat
look
tom
malone
began
all
right
all
right
boyd
said
tiredly
duty
is
duty
i
go
call
her
fine
malone
said
and
meanwhile
i
get
us
a
little
insurance
insurance
john
henry
fernack
malone
said
and
his
safe
and
loft
squad
the
warehouse
was
locked
up
tight
all
right
malone
thought
in
the
dim
light
that
surrounded
the
neighborhood
it
stood
like
a
single
stone
block
alone
near
the
waterfront
there
were
other
buildings
nearby
but
they
seemed
smaller
the
warehouse
loomed
over
malone
and
boyd
threateningly
they
stood
in
a
alley
just
across
the
street
watching
the
big
building
nervously
studying
it
for
weak
points
and
escape
areas
boyd
whispered
softly
do
you
think
they
have
a
malone
voice
was
equally
low
we
have
to
assume
they
got
at
least
one
kid
posted
he
said
but
they
ca
be
watching
all
the
time
remember
they
ca
do
everything
they
do
have
to
boyd
said
they
do
quite
enough
for
me
do
you
realize
that
right
now
i
could
be
break
it
up
malone
said
he
took
a
small
handset
from
his
pocket
and
pressed
the
stud
lynch
he
whispered
a
tinny
voice
came
from
the
earpiece
here
malone
have
you
got
them
located
yet
malone
said
not
yet
lynch
voice
replied
we
working
on
a
triangulation
now
just
hold
on
for
a
minute
or
so
i
let
you
know
as
soon
as
we
got
results
the
police
squads
lynch
and
his
men
the
warehouse
precinct
men
and
the
safe
and
loft
squad
had
set
up
a
careful
cordon
around
the
area
and
were
now
hard
at
work
trying
to
determine
two
things
first
they
had
to
know
whether
there
was
anybody
in
the
building
at
all
second
they
had
to
be
able
to
locate
anyone
in
the
building
with
precision
the
silence
of
the
downtown
warehouse
district
helped
they
had
several
specially
designed
highly
sensitive
directional
microphones
aimed
at
the
building
from
carefully
selected
spots
around
the
area
trying
to
pick
up
the
muffled
sounds
of
speech
or
motion
within
the
warehouse
the
watchmen
in
buildings
nearby
had
been
warned
off
for
the
time
being
so
that
their
footsteps
would
occlude
any
results
malone
waited
feeling
nervous
and
cold
finally
lynch
voice
came
through
again
we
getting
something
all
right
he
said
there
are
obviously
several
people
in
there
you
were
right
malone
thanks
malone
said
how
about
that
fix
hold
it
a
second
lynch
said
wind
swept
off
the
river
at
malone
and
boyd
malone
closed
his
eyes
and
shivered
he
could
smell
fish
and
iodine
and
waste
the
odor
of
the
hudson
as
it
passes
the
city
across
the
river
lights
sparkled
warmly
here
there
was
nothing
but
darkness
a
long
time
passed
perhaps
ten
seconds
then
lynch
voice
was
back
sergeant
mcnulty
says
they
on
the
top
floor
malone
he
said
ca
tell
how
many
for
sure
but
talking
and
moving
around
it
a
shame
these
things
wo
pick
up
the
actual
words
at
a
distance
malone
said
just
a
general
feeling
of
noise
is
all
we
get
lynch
said
but
it
does
some
good
sure
malone
said
now
listen
carefully
boyd
and
i
are
going
in
alone
lynch
voice
whispered
right
if
those
mikes
pick
up
any
unusual
ruckus
any
sharp
increase
in
the
noise
level
come
running
malone
said
otherwise
just
sit
still
and
wait
for
my
signal
got
that
check
lynch
said
malone
pocketed
the
radiophone
okay
tom
he
whispered
this
is
it
right
boyd
muttered
let
move
in
wait
a
minute
malone
said
he
took
his
goggles
and
brought
them
down
over
his
eyes
adjusting
the
helmet
on
his
head
boyd
did
the
same
malone
flicked
on
the
infrared
flashlight
he
held
in
his
hand
okay
he
whispered
check
boyd
said
thanks
to
the
goggles
both
of
them
could
see
the
normally
invisible
beams
of
the
infrared
flashlight
they
equipped
themselves
to
move
in
darkness
without
betraying
themselves
and
they
be
able
to
see
where
a
person
without
equipment
would
be
blind
malone
stayed
well
within
the
shadows
as
he
moved
silently
around
to
the
alley
behind
the
warehouse
and
then
to
a
narrow
passageway
that
led
to
the
building
next
door
boyd
followed
a
few
feet
behind
him
along
the
carefully
planned
route
malone
unlocked
the
small
door
that
led
into
the
ground
floor
of
the
building
adjoining
as
he
did
so
he
heard
a
sound
behind
him
and
called
tom
hey
malone
boyd
whispered
it
before
there
was
any
outcry
malone
rushed
back
boyd
was
struggling
with
a
figure
in
the
dimness
malone
grabbed
the
figure
and
clamped
his
hand
over
its
mouth
it
bit
him
he
swore
in
a
low
voice
and
clamped
the
hand
over
the
mouth
again
it
had
taken
him
more
than
half
a
second
to
realize
what
whoever
it
was
who
struggled
in
his
arms
it
was
a
boy
shut
up
malone
hissed
in
her
ear
i
wo
hurt
you
the
struggle
stopped
immediately
malone
gently
eased
his
hand
off
the
girl
mouth
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
kenneth
malone
she
said
you
look
like
a
man
from
mars
dorothea
malone
gasped
what
are
you
doing
here
looking
for
your
brother
never
mind
that
she
said
you
play
too
rough
i
going
home
to
mother

me
malone
said
all
right
dorothea
said
you
must
know
anyhow
since
here
yes
i
looking
for
that
fatheaded
brother
of
mine
but
now
i
suppose
it
too
late
he
he
go
to
prison
her
voice
broke
malone
found
his
shoulder
suddenly
occupied
by
a
crying
face
no
he
said
quickly
no
please
he
wo
really
boyd
whispered
malone
what
is
this
it
a
hell
of
a
place
for
a
date
and
i
oh
shut
up
malone
told
him
in
a
kindly
fashion
he
turned
back
to
dorothea
i
promise
he
wo
he
said
if
i
can
just
talk
to
your
brother
make
him
listen
to
reason
i
think
we
can
get
him
and
the
others
off
believe
me
but
you
please
malone
said
believe
me
oh
ken
dorothea
said
raising
her
head
do
you
mean
it
sure
i
mean
it
malone
said
what
have
i
been
saying
the
government
needs
these
kids
the
government
it
nothing
to
worry
about
malone
said
just
go
on
home
now
and
i
call
you
tomorrow
late
tonight
if
i
can
all
right
no
dorothea
said
it
not
all
right
not
at
all
but
boyd
hissed
malone
malone
ignored
him
he
had
a
bigger
fight
on
his
hands
i
not
going
home
dorothea
announced
i
going
in
there
with
you
after
all
she
added
i
can
talk
more
sense
into
mike
head
than
you
can
now
look
malone
began
dorothea
grinned
in
the
darkness
if
you
do
take
me
along
she
said
quietly
i
scream
and
warn
them
malone
surrendered
at
once
he
had
no
doubt
at
all
that
dorothea
meant
what
she
said
and
after
all
the
girl
might
really
be
some
use
to
them
and
there
probably
would
be
much
danger
of
course
there
would
he
thought
he
was
going
to
see
to
that
all
right
he
said
come
along
stick
close
to
us
and
do
worry
about
the
darkness
we
can
see
even
if
you
ca
so
let
us
guide
you
and
for
heaven
sake
be
quiet
boyd
whispered
malone
what
going
on
she
coming
with
us
malone
said
pointing
to
dorothea
boyd
shrugged
malone
he
said
who
do
you
think
you
are
the
pied
piper
of
hamelin
malone
wheeled
and
went
ahead
opening
the
door
he
played
his
flashlight
on
the
room
inside
and
he
boyd
and
dorothea
trailed
in
going
through
rooms
piled
with
huge
boxes
they
went
up
an
iron
stairway
to
the
second
floor
and
so
on
up
to
the
roof
they
moved
quickly
across
the
roof
to
the
wall
of
the
warehouse
which
was
two
stories
higher
than
the
building
they
were
on
of
course
there
were
no
windows
in
the
warehouse
wall
facing
them
except
on
the
top
story
but
there
was
a
single
heavy
fireproof
emergency
exit
it
would
have
taken
power
machinery
or
explosive
to
open
that
door
from
the
outside
without
a
key
although
from
the
inside
it
would
open
easily
fortunately
malone
had
a
key
he
took
it
out
and
stepped
aside
give
that
lock
the
works
he
whispered
to
boyd
boyd
took
a
lubricant
gun
from
his
pocket
and
fired
three
silent
shots
of
special
oil
into
the
lock
then
he
shot
the
hinges
and
the
cracks
around
the
door
they
waited
for
a
minute
or
two
while
the
oil
forced
in
under
pressure
did
its
work
then
malone
fitted
the
key
carefully
into
the
lock
and
turned
it
slowly
and
delicately
the
door
swung
open
in
silence
malone
slipped
inside
followed
by
boyd
and
dorothea
fueyo
infrared
equipment
went
on
again
and
the
eerie
illumination
spread
over
their
surroundings
malone
tapped
boyd
on
the
shoulder
and
jerked
his
thumb
toward
the
back
stairs
this
was
plainly
no
time
for
talk
from
the
floor
above
they
could
hear
the
murmur
of
youthful
voices
they
started
for
the
stairway
fortunately
the
building
was
of
the
type
there
were
no
wooden
floors
to
creak
and
groan
beneath
their
feet
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
they
paused
voices
came
down
the
stairwell
clearly
even
words
being
defined
in
the
silence
and
quit
harping
on
whose
fault
it
was
malone
recognized
mike
fueyo
voice
that
fbi
guy
was
onto
us
and
we
had
to
pull
out
you
know
that
we
always
figured
we
have
to
pull
out
some
day
so
why
not
now
yeah
another
voice
said
but
you
did
have
to
go
and
vanish
right
under
that
fed
nose
you
been
beating
it
into
our
heads
not
to
do
that
sort
of
stuff
ever
since
we
first
found
out
we
could
make
this
vanishing
bit
and
then
you
go
and
do
it
in
front
of
a
fed
sure
you
got
a
big
bang
out
of
it
but
is
it
smart
i
ask
you
yeah
mike
said
listen
silvo
they
never
would
got
onto
us
if
it
had
been
for
your
stupid
tricks
slugging
a
cop
on
the
dome
cracking
up
a
car
you
and
your
bug
for
speed
malone
blinked
then
it
had
been
miguel
fueyo
who
hit
sergeant
jukovsky
but
silvo
malone
tried
to
remember
the
list
of
silent
spooks
silvo
envoz
that
was
his
name
you
slugged
the
fbi
guy
mike
silvo
said
and
now
you
got
us
all
on
the
run
that
your
fault
mike
i
want
to
see
my
old
lady
i
had
to
slug
him
mike
said
listen
all
ramon
stuff
was
in
that
cadillac
what
would
happened
if
he
found
all
that
stuff
so
what
happened
anyway
a
third
voice
said
that
was
probably
ramon
otravez
malone
thought
he
found
your
stupid
notebook
he
he
went
yelling
to
the
cops
did
he
we
running
ai
we
so
what
the
difference
shut
up
mike
roared
you
ai
telling
me
to
shut
up
me
either
silvo
yelled
you
think
you
a
great
big
you
think
you
king
of
the
world
who
figured
out
the
vanish
mike
screamed
you
all
be
a
bunch
of
bums
if
i
had
showed
you
that
and
you
know
it
you
all
do
give
us
that
silvo
said
we
have
been
able
to
do
it
same
as
you
like
you
said
anybody
who
got
talent
could
do
it
there
were
guys
you
tried
to
teach
sure
said
a
fourth
voice
listen
fueyo
you
so
bright
so
why
do
you
try
teaching
it
to
somebody
who
do
have
the
talent
yeah
said
voice
number
five
you
think
you
could
teach
that
flashy
sister
of
yours
the
vanish
you
shut
up
about
my
sister
phil
mike
screamed
so
what
so
great
about
her
she
got
that
book
back
from
the
fed
mike
said
that
what
enough
hell
a
voice
said
any
dame
with
a
little
shut
your
goddamn
face
before
i
shut
it
for
you
malone
could
tell
who
was
yelling
what
at
who
after
a
minute
they
all
seemed
unhappy
about
being
on
the
run
from
the
police
and
they
were
all
tired
of
being
cooped
up
in
a
warehouse
under
mike
orders
mike
was
the
only
person
they
could
take
it
out
on
and
mike
was
under
heavy
attack
two
of
the
boys
surprisingly
seemed
to
side
with
him
the
other
five
were
trying
to
outshout
them
malone
wondered
if
it
would
become
a
fight
and
then
realized
that
these
kids
could
hardly
fight
each
other
when
the
one
who
was
losing
could
always
fade
out
he
leaned
over
and
whispered
to
dorothea
and
boyd
let
sneak
up
there
while
the
argument
going
on
but
boyd
began
less
chance
of
their
noticing
us
malone
explained
and
started
forward
they
tiptoed
up
the
stairs
and
got
behind
a
pile
of
crates
in
the
shadows
while
invective
roared
around
them
this
floor
was
lit
by
a
single
small
bulb
hanging
from
a
socket
in
the
ceiling
the
windows
were
hung
with
heavy
blankets
to
keep
the
light
from
shining
out
the
kids
did
notice
anything
except
each
other
malone
took
a
couple
of
deep
breaths
and
began
to
look
around
all
things
considered
he
thought
the
kids
had
fixed
the
place
up
pretty
nicely
the
unused
warehouse
had
practically
been
made
over
into
an
apartment
there
were
chairs
beds
tables
and
everything
else
in
the
line
of
furnishings
for
which
the
kids
could
conceivably
have
any
use
there
were
even
some
floor
lamps
scattered
around
but
they
were
plugged
in
malone
guessed
that
a
job
would
have
to
be
done
on
the
warehouse
wiring
to
get
the
floor
lamps
in
operation
and
the
kids
just
had
got
around
to
it
yet
by
now
the
boys
were
practically
standing
ripping
epithets
at
each
other
not
a
single
hand
was
lifted
malone
stared
at
them
for
a
second
then
turned
to
dorothea
wait
till
they
calm
down
a
little
he
whispered
then
you
go
out
and
talk
to
them
tell
them
we
wo
hurt
them
or
lock
them
up
or
anything
all
we
want
to
do
is
talk
to
them
for
awhile
all
right
she
whispered
back
they
can
vanish
any
time
they
want
to
malone
said
so
there
no
reason
for
them
not
to
listen
to
he
stopped
suddenly
listening
over
the
shouting
screaming
and
cursing
of
the
kids
he
heard
motion
on
the
floor
below
cops
it
could
be
he
told
himself
but
when
he
took
out
his
radiophone
his
hands
were
shaking
a
little
lynch
voice
was
already
coming
over
it
when
malone
thumbed
it
on
so
hang
on
malone
i
repeat
we
heard
the
ruckus
and
coming
in
we
on
our
way
hang
on
malone
the
voice
stopped
there
was
a
click
malone
stared
at
the
handset
fascinated
and
horrified
he
swallowed
no
lynch
he
whispered
afraid
to
talk
any
louder
for
fear
the
kids
would
hear
him
no
do
come
up
go
away
repeat
go
away
stay
away
lynch
it
was
no
use
the
radiophone
was
dead
lynch
apparently
thinking
malone
set
had
been
smashed
in
the
fight
or
else
that
malone
was
unconscious
had
shut
his
own
receiver
off
there
was
absolutely
nothing
that
malone
could
do
the
kids
were
still
yelling
at
the
top
of
their
voices
but
the
thundering
of
heavy
flat
feet
galumphing
up
from
the
lower
depths
could
be
ignored
for
long
all
the
boys
noticed
it
at
about
the
same
time
they
jerked
their
heads
round
to
face
the
stairway
malone
and
his
compatriots
crouched
lower
behind
the
boxes
mike
fueyo
was
the
first
to
speak
do
vanish
yet
he
snapped
let
see
who
it
is
the
internal
dissent
among
the
silent
spooks
disappeared
as
if
it
had
never
been
as
they
faced
a
common
foe
once
again
they
fell
naturally
under
fueyo
leadership
if
it
cops
he
said
we
give
the
grasshopper
play
we
worked
out
we
show
they
ca
fool
with
us
another
boy
said
sure
the
grasshopper
play
it
was
cops
all
right
lieutenant
lynch
ran
up
the
stairs
waving
his
billy
in
a
heroic
fashion
followed
by
a
horde
of
officers
where
malone
lynch
shouted
as
he
came
through
the
doorway
where
your
what
mike
yelled
back
and
the
fight
was
on
later
malone
thought
that
he
should
have
been
surprised
but
he
was
there
was
any
time
to
be
surprised
the
kids
disappear
they
spread
out
over
the
floor
of
the
room
easily
and
lightly
and
the
cops
charged
them
in
a
great
blundering
mass
naturally
the
kids
winked
out
one
by
one
and
in
the
center
of
the
cops
muddle
malone
saw
one
cop
raise
his
billy
and
swing
it
at
mike
mike
watched
it
come
down
and
vanished
at
the
last
instant
the
cop
billy
descended
on
the
head
of
another
cop
standing
just
behind
where
mike
had
been
the
second
cop
blinded
by
the
blow
on
his
head
swung
back
and
hit
the
first
cop
meanwhile
mike
was
somewhere
else
malone
stayed
crouched
behind
the
boxes
dorothea
stood
up
and
shouted
mike
mike
we
just
want
to
talk
to
you
unfortunately
the
police
were
making
such
a
racket
that
this
could
not
be
heard
more
than
a
foot
or
so
from
the
speaker
lynch
himself
charged
into
the
mass
swinging
his
billy
and
his
free
fist
and
laying
others
out
one
after
the
other
pretty
soon
the
floor
was
littered
with
cops
lynch
was
doing
yeoman
duty
but
it
was
hard
to
tell
what
side
he
was
on
the
vanishing
trick
mike
had
worked
out
was
being
used
by
all
of
the
kids
cops
were
hitting
other
cops
lynch
was
hitting
everybody
and
the
kids
were
winking
on
and
off
all
over
the
loft
it
was
a
scene
of
tremendous
noise
and
carnage
malone
suddenly
sprang
to
his
feet
and
charged
into
the
melee
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
and
swinging
both
fists
the
first
person
he
saw
was
one
of
the
and
he
charged
him
with
abandon
he
should
he
reflected
have
known
better
the
kid
disappeared
malone
caromed
off
the
stomach
of
a
policeman
received
a
blow
on
the
shoulder
from
his
billy
and
rebounded
into
the
arms
of
a
surprised
police
officer
at
the
edge
of
the
battle
who
you
the
officer
gasped
malone
malone
said
you
on
our
side
how
about
you
malone
said
i
a
lieutenant
here
the
officer
said
in
charge
of
the
warehouse
precinct
i
malone
and
the
lieutenant
stepped
nimbly
aside
as
another
cop
careened
by
them
waving
his
billy
helplessly
they
looked
away
as
the
crash
came
the
cop
had
fallen
over
a
table
and
now
lay
with
his
legs
in
the
air
supported
by
the
overturned
table
blissfully
unconscious
we
seem
malone
said
to
be
in
an
area
of
some
activity
move
they
shifted
away
a
few
feet
malone
looked
into
the
foray
and
saw
boyd
at
work
roaring
and
going
after
the
kids
one
of
them
had
established
a
kind
of
game
with
him
he
appeared
just
in
front
of
boyd
who
rushed
at
him
arms
outstretched
as
boyd
almost
reached
him
the
kid
disappeared
and
reappeared
again
just
behind
boyd
he
tapped
the
fbi
agent
gently
on
the
shoulder
boyd
turned
and
the
process
was
repeated
boyd
seemed
to
be
getting
winded
damn
kids
the
lieutenant
muttered
suddenly
and
dashed
back
into
the
fray
malone
looked
around
saw
mike
fueyo
flickering
in
and
out
at
the
edges
and
headed
for
him
a
cop
swung
at
mike
missed
and
hit
malone
on
the
arm
malone
swore
the
cop
backed
off
looking
in
a
bewildered
fashion
for
his
victim
who
was
nowhere
in
sight
then
malone
caught
sight
of
him
at
the
other
edge
of
the
fight
he
started
to
work
his
way
around
he
tried
to
avoid
blows
but
it
was
always
possible
a
reeling
cop
caught
his
lapel
and
tore
it
and
lynch
indefatigable
in
battle
managed
to
graze
his
chin
with
a
blow
meant
for
one
of
the
disappearing
boys
other
cops
were
battling
each
other
going
after
the
kids
and
clutching
empty
air
cursing
and
screaming
unheard
orders
in
the
fracas
malone
ducked
past
lynch
rubbed
at
his
chin
and
looked
for
mike
in
the
tangle
of
bodies
it
was
getting
hard
to
see
there
was
the
sound
of
breaking
ceramics
as
a
floor
lamp
went
over
and
then
a
table
followed
it
but
malone
avoided
both
he
looked
for
mike
fueyo
a
cop
clutched
him
around
the
middle
out
of
nowhere
said
sorry
buddy
who
the
hell
are
you
and
dove
back
into
the
mass
of
bodies
malone
caught
his
breath
and
forged
onward
there
was
mike
at
the
edge
of
the
fight
watching
everything
coolly
no
cop
was
near
him
in
the
dim
light
the
place
looked
like
a
scene
from
hell
a
special
hell
for
policemen
malone
wove
through
battling
hordes
to
the
edge
and
came
out
a
few
feet
away
from
mike
fueyo
fueyo
did
see
him
he
was
looking
at
boyd
instead
still
stumbling
back
and
forth
as
the
baiting
him
winked
on
and
off
in
front
of
him
and
behind
him
he
was
laughing
malone
came
up
silently
from
behind
the
trip
seemed
to
take
hours
he
was
being
very
quiet
although
he
was
reasonably
sure
that
even
if
he
yelled
he
would
be
heard
but
he
did
want
to
take
the
slightest
chance
he
sprang
on
mike
and
attached
the
handcuffs
to
his
wrist
and
to
mike
wrist
within
ten
seconds
ha
he
said
involuntarily
now
come
with
me
he
gave
his
end
of
the
handcuffs
a
tremendous
yank
he
started
to
stagger
trailing
an
empty
cuff
behind
him
flailing
his
arms
wildly
ahead
of
him
he
could
see
a
big
cop
with
an
upraised
billy
malone
tried
to
alter
his
course
but
it
was
too
late
he
skidded
helplessly
into
the
cop
who
jerked
round
and
swung
the
billy
automatically
malone
said
ugh
as
he
caught
the
blow
on
the
cheekbone
bounced
off
the
cop
and
kept
going
he
careened
past
a
blur
of
figures
trying
to
avoid
hard
surfaces
and
other
human
beings
but
there
was
oh
no
malone
thought
lynch
lynch
was
ready
to
swing
his
fist
was
cocked
and
he
was
heading
for
one
of
the
with
murder
in
his
eye
malone
knew
their
paths
were
going
to
intersect
watch
out
he
yelled
watch
out
it
me
stop
me
somebody
stop
me
he
went
completely
unheard
lynch
swung
and
missed
hitting
a
cop
who
had
been
hiding
behind
the
the
cop
went
down
to
join
the
wounded
and
lynch
roared
like
a
bull
and
swung
around
looking
for
more
enemies
that
was
when
malone
hit
him
long
afterward
he
remembered
lynch
hat
sailing
through
the
air
and
landing
in
the
center
of
a
struggling
mass
of
policemen
he
remembered
lynch
saying
so
there
you
are
and
swinging
before
he
looked
he
remembered
the
blow
on
the
chin
and
then
he
remembered
falling
and
falling
and
falling
somewhere
there
was
a
voice
where
the
hell
are
they
they
disappeared
for
good
and
then
for
long
seconds
nothing
he
woke
up
with
a
headache
but
it
was
too
bad
surprisingly
not
much
time
had
passed
he
got
up
and
dusted
off
his
trousers
looking
around
at
the
battlefield
wounded
and
groaning
cops
were
lying
all
over
the
room
was
a
shambles
the
walking
wounded
which
comprised
the
rest
of
the
force
were
stumbling
around
in
a
slow
hopeless
sort
of
fashion
lynch
was
standing
next
to
him
malone
he
said
i
sorry
i
hit
you
did
i
malone
said
you
seemed
to
be
hitting
every
body
i
was
for
the
kids
lynch
said
so
was
i
malone
said
i
got
the
cuffs
on
one
and
yanked
him
along
but
he
disappeared
and
left
me
with
the
cuffs
great
lynch
said
hell
of
a
raid
very
jolly
malone
agreed
fun
and
games
were
had
by
all
a
cop
stumbled
up
handed
lynch
his
cap
and
disappeared
without
a
word
lynch
stared
mournfully
at
it
the
emblem
was
crushed
and
the
cap
looked
rather
worn
and
useless
he
put
it
on
his
head
where
it
assumed
the
rakish
tilt
of
a
hobo
favorite
and
said
i
hope
you
not
thinking
of
blaming
for
this
fiasco
not
at
all
malone
said
nobly
he
hurt
all
over
but
on
reflection
he
thought
that
he
would
probably
live
it
was
nobody
fault
except
he
thought
his
own
if
he
only
told
lynch
to
come
in
when
called
for
and
under
no
other
circumstances
this
would
have
happened
he
looked
around
at
the
remains
of
new
york
finest
and
felt
guilty
the
lieutenant
from
the
local
precinct
limped
up
rubbing
a
shin
and
trying
to
disentangle
pieces
of
floor
lamp
from
his
hair
listen
lynch
he
said
what
with
these
kids
going
on
here
look
at
my
men
some
days
lynch
said
it
just
does
pay
to
get
up
sure
the
local
man
said
but
what
do
i
do
now
make
your
reports
but
to
the
commissioner
lynch
said
and
to
nobody
else
if
this
gets
into
the
papers
heads
will
roll
my
head
is
rolling
right
now
the
local
man
said
know
what
one
of
those
kids
did
stood
in
front
of
a
floor
lamp
i
swung
at
him
and
he
vanished
vanished
i
hit
the
lamp
and
then
the
lamp
hit
me
just
see
that
this
does
get
out
lynch
said
it
ca
the
local
man
said
anybody
who
mentioned
this
to
a
reporter
would
just
be
laughed
out
of
town
it
not
possible
he
paused
thoughtfully
and
added
we
all
be
laughed
out
of
town
and
probably
replaced
with
the
fbi
lynch
said
morosely
he
looked
at
malone
nothing
personal
you
understand
he
said
of
course
malone
said
we
ca
do
any
more
here
can
we
i
do
think
we
can
do
any
more
anywhere
lynch
said
let
lock
the
place
up
and
leave
and
forget
all
about
it
fine
malone
said
i
got
work
to
do
he
looked
around
found
dorothea
and
signaled
to
her
come
on
dorothea
where
boyd
here
i
am
boyd
said
walking
slowly
across
the
big
room
to
malone
he
had
one
hand
held
to
his
chin
what
the
matter
with
you
malone
asked
boyd
took
his
hand
away
there
was
a
bald
spot
the
size
of
a
quarter
on
the
point
of
his
chin
one
of
those
kids
he
said
sadly
has
a
hell
of
a
strong
grip
come
on
miss
fueyo
come
on
malone
let
get
out
of
here
logically
malone
said
there
has
to
be
way
to
catch
them
he
looked
around
the
hotel
room
as
though
he
expected
to
find
an
answer
painted
in
big
black
letters
on
the
wall
logically
he
said
again
and
tried
to
think
of
what
came
next
he
liked
the
sound
of
the
word
but
that
was
as
far
as
it
went
that
fine
boyd
said
he
sat
on
a
chair
staring
gloomily
at
the
floor
and
rubbing
the
bald
spot
on
his
chin
with
a
single
sad
inquisitive
forefinger
there
has
to
be
an
answer
you
probably
right
but
what
the
hell
is
it
malone
started
to
answer
and
then
wondered
what
he
had
been
going
to
say
he
sunk
himself
in
thought
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
there
he
called
glad
of
any
relief
at
all
it
me
a
small
voice
said
dorothea
come
in
malone
said
the
door
opened
dorothea
came
in
shut
the
door
behind
her
and
looked
around
the
room
a
little
awkwardly
did
you
get
a
good
night
sleep
malone
said
she
nodded
i
guess
so
she
said
sure
it
was
nice
of
you
to
get
me
a
room
for
the
night
i
mean
i
guess
i
was
well
forget
it
malone
said
grandly
you
were
upset
and
tired
all
hell
in
the
car
on
the
way
back
here
last
night
you
fainted
i
did
not
faint
she
said
well
malone
said
you
sure
looked
like
i
was
tired
dorothea
said
malone
shrugged
okay
you
were
tired
you
not
mad
are
you
she
said
because
i
stole
your
notebook
of
course
not
malone
said
i
said
forget
it
did
i
sit
down
and
help
us
out
help
you
she
said
that
right
boyd
said
help
us
figure
out
how
to
catch
this
bunch
of
maniacs
before
they
steal
everything
in
new
york
dorothea
said
maniacs
i
and
malone
interrupted
her
in
a
hurry
police
commissioner
fernack
has
called
twice
this
morning
already
he
said
he
screaming
about
all
the
burglaries
that
have
been
occurring
since
midnight
last
night
oh
dorothea
said
you
mean
the
spooks
mike
and
the
others
they
been
stealing
again
they
sure
have
miss
fueyo
boyd
said
i
guess
they
furnishing
their
new
hideout
malone
said
wherever
it
is
only
god
knows
and
even
if
he
told
us
boyd
said
it
would
do
us
any
good
chase
out
of
there
and
they
go
somewhere
else
malone
stood
up
fished
for
his
cigarettes
and
lit
one
what
we
need
he
said
blowing
out
smoke
is
some
way
to
trap
and
hold
and
i
do
see
how
we
can
do
either
after
last
night
dorothea
said
i
really
do
see
wait
a
minute
boyd
said
you
said
did
you
he
looked
slowly
and
speculatively
at
dorothea
fueyo
a
second
passed
oh
no
you
do
she
said
oh
no
not
on
your
life
i
help
catch
him
if
i
can
because
i
know
you
do
mean
to
hurt
him
or
the
others
but
i
would
want
mike
to
know
about
it
you
not
using
me
as
bait
in
any
trap
boyd
looked
at
malone
shook
his
head
slowly
and
said
disconsolately
well
it
was
an
idea
he
returned
his
gaze
to
the
floor
the
furtive
gleam
of
the
half
bottle
of
bourbon
on
malone
dresser
caught
his
eye
he
had
it
sent
up
the
night
before
feeling
the
need
of
some
medicinal
refreshment
now
it
winked
at
him
he
ignored
it
resolutely
dorothea
he
said
yes
dorothea
do
you
have
any
idea
how
far
one
of
those
kids
can
go
when
he
teleports
no
dorothea
said
i
really
have
any
idea
about
any
of
it
mike
tried
to
teach
me
once
but
i
guess
i
just
do
have
the
talent
oh
malone
said
i
wish
i
could
help
dorothea
said
silence
fell
and
gloom
followed
it
time
ticked
by
the
bourbon
bottle
resumed
its
seductive
winking
there
is
one
thing
dorothea
said
suddenly
he
did
say
one
thing
about
it
what
malone
said
eagerly
he
said
you
could
teleport
to
some
place
you
have
been
before
you
got
to
be
able
to
visualize
where
you
going
malone
said
hmm
it
seemed
like
the
right
answer
statement
was
a
fact
certainly
but
he
did
see
how
the
fact
fit
in
anywhere
he
did
mention
anything
about
distance
and
i
do
think
any
of
the
spooks
ever
tested
it
for
that
dorothea
said
there
probably
is
a
distance
limit
malone
said
at
least
if
theories
are
right
i
just
wish
i
knew
what
the
limit
was
silence
fell
again
malone
sighed
dorothea
sighed
boyd
sighed
looked
around
at
the
others
and
muttered
damn
thing
catching
he
got
up
and
walked
over
to
the
dresser
and
picked
up
the
bottle
of
bourbon
you
too
malone
murmured
but
boyd
did
hear
him
i
do
care
if
it
is
early
in
the
morning
he
said
resolutely
i
need
a
drink
i
need
something
to
take
the
fog
out
of
my
head
anyhow
he
poured
himself
a
shot
held
the
bottle
aloft
and
said
dorothea
malone
the
girl
shook
her
head
malone
was
tempted
but
he
put
satan
behind
him
with
decision
no
he
said
firmly
the
way
i
feel
now
one
drink
would
probably
immobilize
me
dorothea
chuckled
you
sound
just
like
mike
she
said
mike
does
drink
in
the
morning
either
malone
said
of
course
he
does
boyd
said
mike
is
a
nice
kid
a
swell
kid
you
keep
quiet
dorothea
shot
at
him
she
turned
back
to
malone
mike
never
drinks
at
all
she
said
he
says
it
immobilizes
him
just
what
you
said
somewhere
in
the
black
galactic
depths
of
malone
mind
a
very
small
hot
star
gulped
took
a
deep
breath
and
became
a
supernova
the
light
was
tremendous
it
shed
beams
over
everything
beams
of
a
positively
supernal
brilliance
and
in
the
brightness
of
that
single
inner
light
bits
of
data
began
to
fall
into
place
with
all
the
precision
of
aerial
bombs
each
falling
neatly
and
exactly
into
its
own
little
predetermined
bomb
crater
it
was
beautiful
it
was
magnificent
malone
felt
all
choked
up
none
of
the
silent
spooks
drank
he
remembered
kettleman
telling
him
that
and
the
queen
never
touched
the
stuff
either
what
wrong
boyd
said
malone
you
look
green
i
feel
green
malone
said
i
feel
like
newly
sprung
grass
i
feel
as
if
i
had
just
hatched
out
of
something
i
feel
wonderful
it
the
strain
boyd
said
that
what
it
is
strain
cracked
at
last
malone
ignored
him
tell
me
he
said
to
dorothea
with
elaborate
casualness
when
your
brother
says
that
what
does
he
mean
what
she
said
oh
i
do
know
i
she
stopped
and
her
eyes
widened
you
do
think
that
i
do
know
malone
said
but
we
can
sure
as
hell
find
out
dorothea
blinked
what
can
you
do
she
said
i
mean
to
find
out
you
ca
force
them
to
drink
or
anything
can
you
no
malone
said
i
ca
do
that
but
it
does
give
me
an
idea
boyd
held
his
untasted
drink
in
his
hand
staring
at

cheerfully

said

what
effect
drugs

on
psionic
abilities

boyd
said
and
then
his
eyes
lit
up
my
god
he
said
we
might
have
something
at
that
get
the
queen
up
too
malone
said
ask
her
the
same
question
i
hope
we
do
have
something

i
dorothea
said
and
if
we
get
the
information

hoping
to

i
want

majesty
on
the
first
plane
to
new
york
malone
said
i
do
care
what
strings
you
have
to
pull
to
get
that
done
call
burris
if
you
have
to
it
be
worth
it
malone
paused
hell
he
said
call
him
anyway
and
tell
him
what
happened
but
get
the
queen
here
right
boyd
said
he
dove
for
the
phone
and
started
dialing
suddenly
he
looked
around
hey
he
yelled
where
are
you
going
malone
one
hand
on
the
door
turned
down
to
see
fernack
he
said
i
got
to
make
some
arrangements
i
betting
we
right
tom
he
charged
out
the
door
slamming
it
a
second
passed
and
it
opened
again
malone
head
popped
back
in
dorothea
he
said
when
tom
gets
off
the
phone
call
your
mother
tell
her
you
going
to
be
away
for
a
day
or
two
two
at
the
most
and
she
not
to
worry
we
need
you
and
her
too
to
talk
to
mike
when
the
time
comes
so
stick
around
then
he
was
gone
twelve
hours
later
kenneth
malone
was
sitting
quietly
in
a
small
room
at
the
rear
of
a
store
on
upper
madison
avenue
trying
to
remain
calm
and
hoping
that
the
finest
most
beautiful
hunch
he
had
ever
had
in
his
life
was
going
to
pay
off
with
him
were
boyd
and
two
agents
from
the
street
office
they
were
sitting
quietly
too
but
there
was
a
sense
of
enormous
excitement
in
the
air
malone
wanted
to
get
up
and
walk
around
but
he
did
dare
he
clamped
his
hands
in
his
lap
and
sat
tight
they
waited
in
silence
not
daring
to
talk
there
was
no
sound
except
for
the
faint
whoosh
of
their
breathing
through
the
gas
masks
they
were
wearing
and
the
muffled
hiss
from
a
tank
nearby
there
was
no
reason
why
the
plan
should
work
malone
told
himself
it
looked
foolproof
but
he
did
believe
it
would
work
this
was
the
time
he
assured
himself
that
his
luck
ran
out
he
been
lucky
for
too
long
and
now
the
wheel
was
going
to
turn
and
he
be
lost
all
he
could
do
was
wait
for
it
and
hope
her
majesty
had
said
definitely
that
this
would
be
the
place
the
spooks
would
hit
tonight
she
had
no
doubts
about
it
and
malone
could
think
of
a
single
reason
why
she
might
be
wrong
but
maybe
he
got
the
address
mixed
up
maybe
the
spooks
were
somewhere
else
right
now
robbing
what
they
pleased
safe
from
capture
his
hunch
about
drugs
had
been
correct
or
at
least
everybody
had
said
it
was
correct
had
assured
boyd
that
the
deleterious
effects
of
drugs
on
psionic
abilities
had
been
known
ever
since
the
early
days
of
rhine
pioneering
work
more
than
twenty
years
before
and
good
queen
bess
had
admitted
the
same
thing
she
never
drank
she
said
because
on
the
one
occasion
when
she
tried
it
she
lost
her
telepathic
ability
and
my
goodness
it
was
just
like
going
blind
burris
had
had
to
put
on
the
pressure
but
it
had
worked
the
queen
had
been
flown
to
new
york
under
psychiatric
guard
just
as
soon
as
possible
after
boyd
phone
call
and
she
been
able
to
pick
up
mike
fueyo
without
any
trouble
at
all
as
soon
as
she
was
within
the
same
city
and
close
enough
to
him
it
does
do
much
good
to
know
where
a
teleporter
malone
thought
but
it
extremely
handy
to
know
where
he
to
and
if
you
also
know
what
he
plans
to
do
when
he
gets
where
going
you
got
an
absolute
cinch
to
work
with
the
queen
had
provided
that
cinch
reading
mike
mind
she
told
malone
that
he
planned
to
raid
the
store
with
the
rest
of
the
spooks
that
night
lucky
again
malone
thought
he
might
have
had
to
wait
two
or
three
days
before
the
spooks
set
up
a
robbery
but
of
course
he
might
just
be
riding
for
some
kind
of
horrible
unforeseen
fall
the
main
part
of
the
store
was
fairly
well
lit
even
at
night
though
it
was
by
no
means
brightly
illuminated
there
were
lights
on
and
the
street
lamp
from
outside
cast
a
nice
glow
but
the
back
room
was
dark
and
the
four
men
there
were
well
concealed
a
curtain
closed
the
room
off
and
malone
watched
the
front
of
the
store
through
a
narrow
opening
in
it
he
stared
through
it
until
his
eyes
ached
afraid
to
blink
in
case
he
missed
the
appearance
of
the
spooks
everything
had
to
go
off
just
right
precisely
on
schedule
and
it
was
going
to
happen
any
minute
he
told
himself
nervously
in
just
a
few
minutes
everything
would
be
over
malone
held
his
breath
then
he
saw
the
figure
walk
slowly
by
the
glass
front
of
the
shop
looking
in
with
elaborate
casualness
he
was
casing
the
joint
making
sure
there
were
none
left
in
it
mike
fueyo
malone
tried
to
breathe
and
could
seconds
ticked
by
and
then
almost
magically
they
appeared
eight
of
them
almost
simultaneously
in
the
center
of
the
room
mike
fueyo
spoke
in
a
low
controlled
voice
okay
now
he
said
let
move
fast
we
and
that
was
all
he
said
the
odorless
anesthetic
gas
that
filled
the
room
had
its
sudden
effect
fueyo
dropped
out
like
a
light
the
other
seven
followed
him
within
seconds
ramon
otravez
the
tallest
of
them
stayed
on
his
feet
a
little
longer
than
the
rest
obviously
trying
with
all
his
strength
to
teleport
himself
out
of
danger
but
the
effects
of
the
gas
had
already
been
felt
he
was
literally
too
stunned
to
move
he
too
slumped
to
the
floor
for
a
second
after
that
none
of
the
men
in
the
rear
room
moved
then
malone
said
all
right
boys
let
get
them
out
of
here
they
ca
stay
too
long
in
this
atmosphere
the
men
started
forward
into
the
front
room
toward
the
still
bodies
boyd
malone
said
get
out
front
and
wave
the
ambulance
over
here
i
get
the
working
and
stop
the
gas
he
reached
down
and
turned
off
the
valve
on
the
gently
hissing
tank
of
anesthetic
gas
that
sat
on
the
floor
near
him
you
guys
get
the
kids
he
said
and
let
make
it
fast
okay
the
one
thing
we
had
to
worry
about
malone
said
pouring
some
more
champagne
into
the
two
glasses
was
whether
it
was
possible
to
give
them
just
enough
synthecaine
too
little
and
still
be
able
to
teleport
too
much
and
they
be
too
groggy
dorothea
relaxed
in
her
chair
and
looked
around
at
the
hotel
room
walls
with
contentment
she
looked
like
the
proverbial
cat
who
has
swallowed
the
cream
it
looked
to
me
as
if
it
worked
she
said
mike
seemed
pretty
normal
except
that
he
had
that
awful
feeling
malone
handed
her
one
of
the
filled
glasses
with
an
air
he
was
beginning
slowly
to
feel
less
like
the
nervous
uncertain
kenneth
malone
and
more
and
more
like
sir
kenneth
malone
i
can
see
why
he
felt
trapped
he
said
if
a
guy
been
unhampered
by
four
walls
all
the
time
even
only
for
a
year
or
so
he
certainly
going
to
feel
penned
in
when
he
loses
the
ability
to
get
through
them
it
might
be
just
a
little
claustrophobic
he
grinned
proud
of
himself
claustrophobic
he
said
again
my
tongue
and
palate
are
in
excellent
condition
the
main
thing
is
dorothea
said
that
everybody
so
happy
commissioner
fernack
even
with
burris
promising
to
give
him
a
medal
and
lynch
malone
said
reflectively
he
get
a
promotion
out
of
this
for
sure
and
good
old
kettleman
kettleman
dorothea
said
oh
the
funny
fat
man
he
some
kind
of
social
worker
or
something
and
now
he
getting
a
scroll
from
the
fbi
malone
said
a
citation
for
coming
up
with
the
essential
clue
in
this
case
even
though
he
did
know
it
the
essential
clue
you
know
he
added
reflectively
one
thing
puzzles
me
about
that
man
yes
well
malone
said
he
worked
in
your
neighborhood
you
knew
him
of
course
i
did
dorothea
said
we
all
knew
kettleman
he
said
he
had
a
lot
of
success
as
a
social
worker
malone
said
now
i
met
him
and
talked
with
him
and
i
just
ca
picture
oh
dorothea
said
we
keep
him
around
kept
him
around
i
mean
as
a
sort
of
joke
a
pet
or
a
mascot
of
course
he
never
did
catch
on
i
do
suppose
he
has
yet
malone
laughed
nope
he
said
he
has
and
even
your
friend
is
happy
dorothea
said
boyd
malone
said
sure
he
called
his
blonde
and
she
was
just
thrilled
at
the
adventures
of
an
fbi
agent
and
he
with
her
now
you
sound
jealous
dorothea
said
the
hell
i
am
malone
said
and
proceeded
to
prove
his
point
some
minutes
later
they
relaxed
mike
dorothea
said
what
mike
she
said
he
probably
the
happiest
of
all
after
mom
and
i
talked
to
him
for
a
while
anyhow
and
he
began
to
lose
that
that
feeling
now
he
all
excited
about
being
an
fbi
man
she
looked
worriedly
at
malone
for
a
second
you
were
kidding
about
that
were
you
she
said
she
looked
very
pretty
when
she
was
worried
malone
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
with
great
care
after
a
second
the
kiss
seemed
to
gain
momentum
on
its
own
and
all
restraint
went
by
the
wayside
a
long
time
passed
then
as
malone
pulled
away
and
began
to
recover
his
breath
he
said
weakly
you
were
saying
was
i
dorothea
said
oh
yes
i
was
about
mike
being
an
fbi
man
oh
malone
said
well
normally
you
got
to
be
a
lawyer
or
an
accountant
but
there
are
a
few
special
cases
and
maybe
mike
would
fit
into
the
bracket
if
he
does
well
he
be
doing
some
sort
of
official
work
for
the
government
you
can
be
sure
of
that
that
woman
in
the
costume
the
one
you
call
your
majesty
certainly
threw
a
scare
into
the
boys
dorothea
said
well
malone
said
we
had
to
prove
one
thing
to
them
we
can
pick
them
up
at
any
time
you
see
they
got
to
think
about
where
teleporting
and
as
soon
as
they
do
that
one
of
our
telepaths
like
the
queen
will
know
where
they
going
to
be
and
we
can
crack
down
that
what
she
said
dorothea
said
right
malone
said
after
all
we
did
them
quite
a
favor
getting
them
out
of
all
the
trouble
they
gotten
themselves
into
if
they
try
to
that
reminds
me
ken
dorothea
said
all
the
things
that
were
stolen
the
liquor
and
all
of
that
money
what
going
to
happen
to
that
well
malone
said
everything
that
can
be
returned
and
that
includes
most
of
the
liquor
because
they
had
had
a
chance
to
get
rid
of
it
to
the
bootleggers
around
this
area
will
be
returned
what
ca
be
returned
money
stuff
that
they
used
broken
or
sold
well
i
do
exactly
know
about
that
it
might
take
a
special
act
of
congress
he
said
brightly
all
for
the
boys
dorothea
said
well
they
be
at
yucca
flats
and
they
be
pretty
useful
malone
said
and
as
i
was
saying
if
they
try
to
run
away
from
yucca
flats
we
just
have
to
keep
them
drugged
all
the
time
little
as
we
want
to
they
can
be
of
some
use
that
way
too
the
government
doing
all
this
for
nothing
but
keeping
them
drugged
i
said
we
did
want
to
do
it
and
i
do
think
we
have
to
they
be
well
taken
care
of
do
worry
some
of
the
best
psychiatrists
and
doctors
are
out
there
and
mike
and
the
others
if
they
can
show
they
trustworthy
can
come
home
every
weekend
or
even
every
night
if
they
can
teleport
that
far
malone
paused
but
it
is
charity
he
added
we
need
people
with
specialized
psionic
abilities
and
for
a
variety
of
reasons
they
pretty
hard
to
find
you
know
dorothea
said
you
pretty
wonderful
mr
malone
malone
did
answer
her
he
just
kissed
her
again
not
caring
particularly
whether
or
not
the
kiss
went
wild
dorothea
pushed
him
gently
away
i
envious
she
announced
everybody
gets
a
reward
but
me
do
i
get
left
out
just
because
i
swiped
your
notebook
malone
kissed
her
again
what
kind
of
a
reward
do
you
want
he
asked
she
sighed
oh
well
she
said
i
suppose
this
is
good
enough
good
enough
malone
said
just
good
enough
his
lips
met
hers
for
the
fifth
time
she
reached
one
hand
gently
out
to
the
light
switch
and
pushed
it
the
lights
went
out
