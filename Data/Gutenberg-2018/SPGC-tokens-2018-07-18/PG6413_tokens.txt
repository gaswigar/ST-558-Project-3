uses

which
as

reader
will
recall
is

now
introduced

the
abbreviation

is
often
used
for

or
maximalist
often
appears
instead
of
bolshevik
and
minimalist
instead
of
menshevik
the
intellectuals
in
the
revolution
events
move
so
quickly
at
this
time
that
it
is
hard
to
set
them
down
from
memory
even
in
chronological
sequence
neither
newspapers
nor
documents
are
at
our
disposal
and
vet
the
repeated
interruptions
in
the
negotiations
create
a
suspense
which
under
present
circumstances
is
no
longer
bearable
i
shall
endeavor
therefore
to
recall
the
course
and
the
landmarks
of
the
october
revolution
reserving
the
right
to
complete
and
correct
this
exposition
subsequently
in
the
light
of
documents
what
characterized
our
party
almost
from
the
very
first
period
of
the
revolution
was
the
conviction
that
it
would
ultimately
come
into
power
through
the
logic
of
events
i
do
not
refer
to
the
theorists
of
the
party
who
many
years
before
the
revolution
even
before
the
revolution
of
as
a
result
of
their
analysis
of
class
relations
in
russia
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
triumphant
development
of
the
revolution
must
inevitably
transfer
the
power
to
the
proletariat
supported
by
the
vast
masses
of
the
poorest
peasants
the
chief
basis
of
this
prognosis
was
the
insignificance
of
the
russian
bourgeois
democracy
and
the
concentrated
character
of
russian
industrialism
which
makes
of
the
russian
proletariat
a
factor
of
tremendous
social
importance
the
insignificance
of
bourgeois
democracy
is
but
the
complement
of
the
power
and
significance
of
the
proletariat
it
is
true
the
war
has
deceived
many
on
this
point
and
first
of
all
the
leading
groups
of
bourgeois
democracy
themselves
the
war
has
assigned
a
decisive
role
in
the
events
of
the
revolution
to
the
army
the
old
army
meant
the
peasantry
had
the
revolution
developed
more
normally
that
is
under
peaceful
circumstances
as
it
had
in
the
proletariat
would
always
have
held
a
dominant
position
while
the
peasant
masses
would
gradually
have
been
taken
in
tow
by
the
proletariat
and
drawn
into
the
whirlpool
of
the
revolution
but
the
war
produced
an
altogether
different
succession
of
events
the
army
welded
the
peasants
together
not
by
a
political
but
by
a
military
tie
before
the
peasant
masses
could
be
drawn
together
by
revolutionary
demands
and
ideas
they
were
already
organized
in
regimental
staffs
divisions
and
army
corps
the
representatives
of
petty
bourgeois
democracy
scattered
through
this
army
and
playing
a
leading
role
in
it
both
in
a
military
and
in
a
conceptual
way
were
almost
completely
permeated
with
revolutionary
tendencies
the
deep
social
discontent
in
the
masses
became
more
acute
and
was
bound
to
manifest
itself
particularly
because
of
the
military
shipwreck
of
czarism
the
proletariat
as
represented
in
its
advanced
ranks
began
as
soon
as
the
revolution
developed
to
revive
the
tradition
and
called
upon
the
masses
of
the
people
to
organize
in
the
form
of
representative
bodies
soviets
consisting
of
deputies
the
army
was
called
upon
to
send
its
representatives
to
the
revolutionary
organizations
before
its
political
conscience
caught
up
in
any
way
with
the
rapid
course
of
the
revolution
whom
could
the
soldiers
send
as
deputies
eventually
those
representatives
of
the
intellectuals
and
who
chanced
to
be
among
them
and
who
possessed
the
least
bit
of
knowledge
of
political
affairs
and
could
make
this
knowledge
articulate
in
this
way
the
petty
bourgeois
intellectuals
were
at
once
and
of
necessity
raised
to
great
prominence
in
the
awakening
army
doctors
engineers
lawyers
journalists
and
volunteers
who
under
conditions
led
a
rather
retired
life
and
made
no
claim
to
any
importance
suddenly
found
themselves
representative
of
whole
corps
and
armies
and
felt
that
they
were
leaders
of
the
revolution
the
nebulousness
of
their
political
ideology
fully
corresponded
with
the
formlessness
of
the
revolutionary
consciousness
of
the
masses
these
elements
were
extremely
condescending
toward
us
sectarians
for
we
expressed
the
social
demands
of
the
workers
and
the
peasants
most
pointedly
and
uncompromisingly
at
the
same
time
the
petty
bourgeois
democracy
with
the
arrogance
of
revolutionary
upstarts
harbored
the
deepest
mistrust
of
itself
and
of
the
very
masses
who
had
raised
it
to
such
unexpected
heights
calling
themselves
socialists
and
considering
themselves
such
the
intellectuals
were
filled
with
an
respect
for
the
political
power
of
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
towards
their
knowledge
and
methods
to
this
was
due
the
effort
of
the
petty
bourgeois
leaders
to
secure
at
any
cost
a
cooperation
union
or
coalition
with
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
the
programme
of
the
created
wholly
out
of
nebulous
humanitarian
formulas
substituting
sentimental
generalizations
and
moralistic
superstructures
for
a
attitude
proved
to
be
the
thing
best
adapted
for
a
spiritual
vestment
of
this
type
of
leaders
their
efforts
in
one
way
or
another
to
prop
up
their
spiritual
and
political
helplessness
by
the
science
and
politics
of
the
bourgeoisie
which
so
overawed
them
found
its
theoretical
justification
in
the
teachings
of
the
mensheviki
who
explained
that
the
present
revolution
was
a
bourgeois
revolution
and
therefore
could
not
succeed
without
the
participation
of
the
bourgeoisie
in
the
government
in
this
way
the
natural
bloc
of
and
mensheviki
was
created
which
gave
simultaneous
expression
to
the
political
lukewarmness
of
the
intellectuals
and
its
relation
of
vassal
to
imperialistic
liberalism
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
us
that
the
logic
of
the
class
struggle
would
sooner
or
later
destroy
this
temporary
combination
and
cast
aside
the
leaders
of
the
transition
period
the
hegemony
of
the
petty
bourgeois
intellectuals
meant
in
reality
that
the
peasantry
which
had
suddenly
been
called
through
the
agency
of
the
military
machine
to
an
organized
participation
in
political
life
had
by
mere
weight
of
numbers
overshadowed
the
working
class
and
temporarily
dislodged
it
more
than
this
to
the
extent
that
the
leaders
had
suddenly
been
lifted
to
terrific
heights
by
the
mere
bulk
of
the
army
the
proletariat
itself
and
its
advanced
minority
had
been
discounted
and
could
not
but
acquire
a
certain
political
respect
for
them
and
a
desire
to
preserve
a
political
bond
with
them
it
might
otherwise
be
in
danger
of
losing
contact
with
the
peasantry
in
the
memories
of
the
older
generation
of
workingmen
the
lesson
of
was
firmly
fixed
then
the
proletariat
was
defeated
just
because
the
heavy
peasant
reserves
did
not
arrive
in
time
for
the
decisive
battle
this
is
why
in
this
first
period
of
the
revolution
even
the
masses
of
workingmen
proved
so
much
more
receptive
to
the
political
ideology
of
the
and
the
mensheviki
all
the
more
so
since
the
revolution
had
awakened
the
hitherto
dormant
and
backward
proletarian
masses
thus
making
uninformed
intellectual
radicalism
into
a
preparatory
school
for
them
the
soviets
of
workingmen
soldiers
and
peasants
deputies
meant
under
these
circumstances
the
domination
of
peasant
formlessness
over
proletarian
socialism
and
the
domination
of
intellectual
radicalism
over
peasant
formlessness
the
soviet
institution
rose
so
rapidly
and
to
such
prominence
largely
because
the
intellectuals
with
their
technical
knowledge
and
bourgeois
connections
played
a
leading
part
in
the
work
of
the
soviet
it
was
clear
to
us
however
that
the
whole
inspiring
structure
was
based
upon
the
deepest
inner
contradictions
and
that
its
downfall
during
the
next
phase
of
the
revolution
was
quite
inevitable
the
revolution
grew
directly
out
of
the
war
and
the
war
became
the
great
test
for
all
parties
and
revolutionary
forces
the
intellectual
leaders
were
against
the
war
many
of
them
under
the
czarist
regime
had
considered
themselves
partisans
of
the
left
wing
of
the
internationale
and
subscribed
to
the
zimmerwald
resolution
but
everything
changed
suddenly
when
they
found
themselves
in
responsible
posts
to
adhere
to
the
policy
of
revolutionary
socialism
meant
under
those
circumstances
to
break
with
the
bourgeoisie
their
own
and
that
of
the
allies
and
we
have
already
said
that
the
political
helplessness
of
the
intellectual
and
middle
class
sought
shelter
for
itself
in
a
union
with
bourgeois
liberalism
this
caused
the
pitiful
and
truly
shameful
attitude
of
the
leaders
towards
the
war
they
confined
themselves
to
sighs
phrases
secret
exhortations
or
appeals
addressed
to
the
allied
governments
while
they
were
actually
following
the
same
path
as
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
the
masses
of
soldiers
in
the
trenches
could
not
of
course
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
war
in
which
they
had
participated
for
nearly
three
years
had
changed
its
character
merely
because
certain
new
persons
who
called
themselves
or
mensheviki
were
taking
part
in
the
petrograd
government
milyukov
displaced
the
bureaucrat
pokrovsky
tereshtchenko
displaced
milyukov
which
means
that
bureaucratic
treachery
had
been
replaced
first
by
militant
cadet
imperialism
then
by
an
unprincipled
nebulous
and
political
subserviency
but
it
brought
no
objective
changes
and
indicated
no
way
out
of
the
terrible
war
just
in
this
lies
the
primary
cause
of
the
subsequent
disorganization
of
the
army
the
agitators
told
the
soldiers
that
the
czarist
government
had
sent
them
into
slaughter
without
any
rime
or
reason
but
those
who
replaced
the
czar
could
not
in
the
least
change
the
character
of
the
war
just
as
they
could
not
find
their
way
clear
for
a
peace
campaign
the
first
months
were
spent
in
merely
marking
time
this
tried
the
patience
both
of
the
army
and
of
the
allied
governments
and
prompted
the
drive
of
june
which
was
demanded
by
the
allies
who
insisted
upon
the
fulfillment
of
the
old
czarist
obligations
scared
by
their
own
helplessness
and
by
the
growing
impatience
of
the
masses
the
leaders
of
the
middle
class
complied
with
this
demand
they
actually
began
to
think
that
in
order
to
obtain
peace
it
was
only
necessary
for
the
russian
army
to
make
a
drive
such
a
drive
seemed
to
offer
a
way
out
of
the
difficult
situation
a
real
solution
of
the
problem
salvation
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a
more
amazing
and
more
criminal
delusion
they
spoke
of
the
drive
in
those
days
in
the
same
terms
that
were
used
by
the
of
all
countries
in
the
first
days
and
weeks
of
the
war
when
speaking
of
the
necessity
of
supporting
the
cause
of
national
defence
of
strengthening
the
holy
alliance
of
nations
etc
all
their
zimmerwald
internationalistic
infatuations
had
vanished
as
if
by
magic
to
us
who
were
in
uncompromising
opposition
it
was
clear
that
the
drive
was
beset
with
terrible
danger
threatening
perhaps
the
ruin
of
the
revolution
itself
we
sounded
the
warning
that
the
army
which
had
been
awakened
and
deeply
stirred
by
the
tumultuous
events
which
it
was
still
far
from
comprehending
could
not
be
sent
into
battle
without
giving
it
new
ideas
which
it
could
recognize
as
its
own
we
warned
accused
threatened
but
as
for
the
dominant
party
tied
up
as
it
was
with
the
allied
bourgeoisie
there
was
no
other
course
we
were
naturally
threatened
with
enmity
with
bitter
hatred
the
campaign
against
the
bolsheviki
the
future
historian
will
look
over
the
pages
of
the
russian
newspapers
for
may
and
june
with
considerable
emotion
for
it
was
then
that
the
agitation
for
the
drive
was
being
carried
on
almost
every
article
without
exception
in
all
the
governmental
and
official
newspapers
was
directed
against
the
bolsheviki
there
was
not
an
accusation
not
a
libel
that
was
not
brought
up
against
us
in
those
days
the
leading
role
in
the
campaign
was
played
of
course
by
the
cadet
bourgeoisie
who
were
prompted
by
their
class
instincts
to
the
knowledge
that
it
was
not
only
a
question
of
a
drive
but
also
of
all
the
further
developments
of
the
revolution
and
primarily
of
the
fate
of
government
control
the
bourgeoisie
machinery
of
public
opinion
revealed
itself
here
in
all
its
power
all
the
organs
organizations
publications
tribunes
and
pulpits
were
pressed
into
the
service
of
a
single
common
idea
to
make
the
bolsheviki
impossible
as
a
political
party
the
concerted
effort
and
the
dramatic
newspaper
campaign
against
the
bolsheviki
already
foreshadowed
the
civil
war
which
was
to
develop
during
the
next
stage
of
the
revolution
the
purpose
of
the
bitterness
of
this
agitation
and
libel
was
to
create
a
total
estrangement
and
irrepressible
enmity
between
the
laboring
masses
on
the
one
hand
and
the
educated
elements
on
the
other
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
understood
that
it
could
not
subdue
the
masses
without
the
aid
and
intercession
of
the
democracy
which
as
we
have
already
pointed
out
proved
to
be
temporarily
the
leader
of
the
revolutionary
organizations
therefore
the
immediate
object
of
the
political
baiting
of
the
bolsheviki
was
to
raise
irreconcilable
enmity
between
our
party
and
the
vast
masses
of
the
socialistic
intellectuals
who
if
they
were
alienated
from
the
proletariat
could
not
but
come
under
the
sway
of
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
during
the
first
council
of
soviets
came
the
first
alarming
peal
of
thunder
foretelling
the
terrible
events
that
were
coming
the
party
designated
the
of
june
as
the
day
for
an
armed
demonstration
at
petrograd
its
immediate
purpose
was
to
influence
the
council
of
soviets
take
the
power
into
your
own
hands
is
what
the
petrograd
workingman
wanted
to
say
plainly
to
the
and
the
mensheviki
sever
relations
with
the
bourgeoisie
give
up
the
idea
of
coalition
and
take
the
power
into
your
own
hands
to
us
it
was
clear
that
the
break
between
the
and
the
mensheviki
on
the
one
hand
and
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
on
the
other
would
compel
the
former
to
seek
the
support
of
the
more
determined
advanced
organization
of
the
proletariat
which
would
thus
be
assured
of
playing
a
leading
role
and
this
is
exactly
what
frightened
the
leaders
together
with
the
government
in
which
they
had
their
representatives
and
hand
in
hand
with
the
liberal
and
bourgeoisie
they
began
a
furious
and
insane
campaign
against
the
proposed
demonstration
as
soon
as
they
heard
of
it
all
their
forces
were
marshalled
against
us
we
had
an
insignificant
minority
in
the
council
and
withdrew
the
demonstration
did
not
take
place
but
this
frustrated
demonstration
left
the
deepest
bitterness
in
the
minds
of
the
two
opposing
forces
widened
the
breach
and
intensified
their
hatred
at
a
secret
conference
of
the
executive
committee
of
the
council
in
which
representatives
of
the
minority
participated
tseretelli
then
minister
of
the
coalition
government
with
all
the
arrogance
of
a
doctrinaire
said
that
the
only
danger
threatening
the
revolution
was
the
bolsheviki
and
the
petrograd
proletariat
armed
by
them
from
this
he
concluded
that
it
was
necessary
to
disarm
the
people
who
did
not
know
how
to
handle
this
referred
to
the
workingmen
and
to
those
parts
of
the
petrograd
garrison
who
were
with
our
party
however
the
disarming
did
not
take
place
for
such
a
sharp
measure
the
political
and
psychological
conditions
were
not
yet
quite
ripe
to
afford
the
masses
some
compensation
for
the
demonstration
they
had
missed
the
council
of
soviets
called
a
general
unarmed
demonstration
for
the
of
june
but
it
was
just
this
very
day
that
marked
the
political
triumph
of
our
party
the
masses
poured
into
the
streets
in
mighty
columns
and
despite
the
fact
that
they
were
called
out
by
the
official
soviet
organization
to
counteract
our
intended
demonstration
of
the
of
june
the
workingmen
and
soldiers
had
inscribed
on
their
banners
and
placards
the
slogans
of
our
party
down
with
secret
treaties
down
with
political
drives
long
live
a
just
peace
down
with
the
ten
capitalistic
ministers
and
all
power
to
the
soviets
of
placards
expressing
confidence
in
the
coalition
government
there
were
but
three
one
from
a
cossack
regiment
another
from
the
plekhanov
group
and
the
third
from
the
petrograd
organization
of
the
bund
composed
mostly
of
elements
this
demonstration
showed
not
only
to
our
enemies
but
also
to
ourselves
as
well
that
we
were
much
stronger
in
petrograd
than
was
generally
supposed
the
drive
of
june
a
governmental
crisis
as
a
result
of
the
demonstration
by
these
revolutionary
bodies
appeared
absolutely
inevitable
but
the
impression
produced
by
the
demonstration
was
lost
as
soon
as
it
was
reported
from
the
front
that
the
revolutionary
army
had
advanced
to
attack
the
enemy
on
the
very
day
that
the
workingmen
and
the
petrograd
garrison
demanded
the
publication
of
the
secret
treaties
and
an
open
offer
of
peace
kerensky
flung
the
revolutionary
troops
into
battle
this
was
no
mere
coincidence
to
be
sure
the
projectors
had
everything
prepared
in
advance
and
the
time
of
attack
was
determined
not
by
military
but
by
political
considerations
on
the
of
june
there
was
a
patriotic
demonstration
in
the
streets
of
petrograd
the
nevsky
prospect
the
chief
artery
of
the
bourgeoisie
was
studded
with
excited
groups
in
which
army
officers
journalists
and
ladies
were
carrying
on
a
bitter
campaign
against
the
bolsheviki
the
first
reports
of
the
military
drive
were
favorable
the
leading
liberal
papers
considered
that
the
principal
aim
had
been
attained
that
the
drive
of
june
regardless
of
its
ultimate
military
results
would
deal
a
mortal
blow
to
the
revolution
restore
the
army
former
discipline
and
assure
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
of
a
commanding
position
in
the
affairs
of
the
government
we
however
indicated
to
the
bourgeoisie
a
different
line
of
future
events
in
a
special
declaration
which
we
made
in
the
soviet
council
a
few
days
before
the
drive
we
declared
that
the
military
advance
would
inevitably
destroy
all
the
internal
ties
within
the
army
set
up
its
various
parts
one
against
the
other
and
turn
the
scales
heavily
in
favor
of
the
elements
since
it
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
discipline
in
a
demoralized
army
an
army
devoid
of
controlling
ideas
without
recourse
to
severe
repressive
measures
in
other
words
we
foretold
in
this
declaration
those
results
which
later
came
to
be
known
collectively
under
the
name
of
kornilovism
we
believed
that
the
greatest
danger
threatened
the
revolution
in
either
case
whether
the
drive
proved
successful
which
we
did
not
expect
or
met
with
failure
which
seemed
to
us
almost
inevitable
a
successful
military
advance
would
have
united
the
middle
class
and
the
bourgeoisie
in
their
common
chauvinistic
tendencies
thus
isolating
the
revolutionary
proletariat
an
unsuccessful
drive
was
likely
to
demoralize
the
army
completely
to
involve
a
general
retreat
and
the
loss
of
much
additional
territory
and
to
bring
disgust
and
disappointment
to
the
people
events
took
the
latter
course
the
news
of
victory
did
not
last
long
it
was
soon
replaced
by
gloomy
reports
of
the
refusal
of
many
regiments
to
support
the
advancing
columns
of
the
great
losses
in
commanding
officers
who
sometimes
composed
the
whole
of
the
attacking
units
etc
in
view
of
its
great
historical
significance
we
append
an
extract
from
the
document
issued
by
our
party
in
the
council
of
soviets
on
the
of
june
just
two
weeks
before
the
drive
we
deem
it
necessary
to
present
as
the
first
order
of
the
day
a
question
on
whose
solution
depend
not
only
all
the
other
measures
to
be
adopted
by
the
council
but
actually
and
literally
the
fate
of
the
whole
russian
revolution
the
question
of
the
military
drive
which
is
being
planned
for
the
immediate
future
having
put
the
people
and
the
army
which
does
not
know
in
the
name
of
what
international
ends
it
is
called
upon
to
shed
its
blood
face
to
face
with
the
impending
attack
with
all
its
consequences
the
circles
of
russia
are
counting
on
the
fact
that
this
drive
will
necessitate
a
concentration
of
power
in
the
hands
of
the
military
diplomatic
and
capitalistic
groups
affiliated
with
english
french
and
american
imperialism
and
thus
free
them
from
the
necessity
of
reckoning
later
with
the
organized
will
of
russian
democracy
the
secret
instigators
of
the
drive
who
do
not
stop
short
even
of
military
adventurism
are
consciously
trying
to
play
on
the
demoralization
in
the
army
brought
about
by
the
internal
and
international
situation
of
the
country
and
to
this
end
are
inspiring
the
discouraged
elements
with
the
fallacious
idea
that
the
very
fact
of
a
drive
can
rehabilitate
the
army
and
by
this
mechanical
means
hide
the
lack
of
a
definite
program
for
liquidating
the
war
at
the
same
time
it
is
clear
that
such
an
advance
can
not
but
completely
disorganize
the
army
by
setting
up
its
various
units
one
against
the
other
the
military
events
were
developing
amid
ever
increasing
difficulties
in
the
internal
life
of
the
nation
with
regard
to
the
land
question
industrial
life
and
national
relations
the
coalition
government
did
not
take
a
single
resolute
step
forward
the
food
and
transportation
situations
were
becoming
more
and
more
disorganized
local
clashes
were
growing
more
frequent
the
socialistic
ministers
were
exhorting
the
masses
to
be
patient
all
decisions
and
measures
including
the
calling
of
the
constituent
assembly
were
being
postponed
the
insolvency
and
the
instability
of
the
coalition
regime
were
obvious
there
were
two
possible
ways
out
to
drive
the
bourgeoisie
out
of
power
and
promote
the
aims
of
the
revolution
or
to
adopt
the
policy
of
bridling
the
people
by
resorting
to
repressive
measures
kerensky
and
tseretelli
clung
to
a
middle
course
and
only
muddled
matters
the
more
when
the
cadets
the
wiser
and
more
leaders
of
the
coalition
government
understood
that
the
unsuccessful
military
advance
of
june
might
deal
a
blow
not
only
to
the
revolution
but
also
to
the
government
temporarily
they
threw
the
whole
weight
of
responsibility
upon
their
allies
to
the
left
on
the
of
july
came
a
crisis
in
the
ministry
the
immediate
cause
of
which
was
the
ukrainian
question
this
was
in
every
respect
a
period
of
most
intense
political
suspense
from
various
points
at
the
front
came
delegates
and
private
individuals
telling
of
the
chaos
which
reigned
in
the
army
as
a
result
of
the
advance
the
government
press
demanded
severe
repressions
such
demands
frequently
came
from
the
socialistic
papers
also
kerensky
more
and
more
openly
went
over
to
the
side
of
the
cadets
and
the
cadet
generals
who
had
manifested
not
only
their
hatred
of
revolution
but
also
their
bitter
enmity
toward
revolutionary
parties
in
general
the
allied
ambassadors
were
pressing
the
government
with
the
demand
that
army
discipline
be
restored
and
the
advance
continued
the
greatest
panic
prevailed
in
government
circles
while
among
the
workingmen
much
discontent
had
accumulated
which
craved
for
outward
expression
avail
yourselves
of
the
resignations
of
the
cadet
ministers
and
take
all
the
power
into
your
own
hands
was
the
call
addressed
by
the
workingmen
of
petrograd
to
the
and
mensheviki
in
control
of
the
soviet
parties
i
recall
the
session
of
the
executive
committee
which
was
held
on
the
of
july
the
soviet
ministers
came
to
report
a
new
crisis
in
the
government
we
were
intensely
interested
to
learn
what
position
they
would
take
now
that
they
had
actually
gone
to
pieces
under
the
great
ordeals
arising
from
coalition
policies
their
spokesman
was
tseretelli
he
nonchalantly
explained
to
the
executive
committee
that
those
concessions
which
he
and
tereshchenko
had
made
to
the
kiev
rada
did
not
by
any
means
signify
a
dismemberment
of
the
country
and
that
this
therefore
did
not
give
the
cadets
any
good
reason
for
leaving
the
ministry
tseretelli
accused
the
cadet
leaders
of
practising
a
centralistic
doctrinairism
of
failing
to
understand
the
necessity
for
compromising
with
the
ukrainians
etc
the
total
impression
was
pitiful
in
the
extreme
the
hopeless
doctrinaire
of
the
coalition
government
was
hurling
the
charge
of
doctrinairism
against
the
crafty
capitalist
politicians
who
seized
upon
the
first
suitable
excuse
for
compelling
their
political
clerks
to
repent
of
the
decisive
turn
they
had
given
to
the
course
of
events
by
the
military
advance
of
june
after
all
the
preceding
experience
of
the
coalition
there
would
seem
to
be
but
one
way
out
of
the
difficulty
to
break
with
the
cadets
and
set
up
a
soviet
government
the
relative
forces
within
the
soviets
were
such
at
the
time
that
the
soviet
power
as
a
political
party
would
fall
naturally
into
the
hands
of
the
and
the
mensheviki
we
deliberately
faced
the
situation
thanks
to
the
possibility
of
reelections
at
any
time
the
mechanism
of
the
soviets
assured
a
sufficiently
exact
reflection
of
the
progressive
shift
toward
the
left
in
the
masses
of
workers
and
soldiers
after
the
break
of
the
coalition
with
the
bourgeoisie
the
radical
tendencies
should
we
expected
receive
a
greater
following
in
the
soviet
organizations
under
such
circumstances
the
proletariat
struggle
for
power
would
naturally
move
in
the
channel
of
soviet
organizations
and
could
take
a
more
normal
course
having
broken
with
the
bourgeoisie
the
democracy
would
itself
fall
under
their
ban
and
would
be
compelled
to
seek
a
closer
union
with
the
socialistic
proletariat
in
this
way
the
indecisiveness
and
political
indefiniteness
of
the
democratic
elements
would
be
overcome
sooner
or
later
by
the
working
masses
with
the
help
of
our
criticism
this
is
the
reason
why
we
demanded
that
the
leading
soviet
parties
in
which
we
had
no
real
confidence
and
we
frankly
said
so
should
take
the
governing
power
into
their
own
hands
but
even
after
the
ministerial
crisis
of
the
of
july
tseretelli
and
his
adherents
did
not
abandon
the
coalition
idea
they
explained
in
the
executive
committee
that
the
leading
cadets
were
indeed
demoralized
by
doctrinairism
and
even
by
but
that
in
the
provinces
there
were
still
many
bourgeois
elements
which
could
still
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
revolutionary
democrats
and
that
in
order
to
make
sure
of
their
it
was
necessary
to
attract
representatives
of
the
bourgeoisie
into
the
membership
of
the
new
ministry
dan
already
entertained
hopes
of
a
party
to
be
hastily
built
up
at
the
time
by
a
few
politicians
the
report
that
the
coalition
government
had
been
broken
up
only
to
be
replaced
by
a
new
coalition
spread
rapidly
through
petrograd
and
provoked
a
storm
of
indignation
among
the
workingmen
and
soldiers
everywhere
thus
the
events
of
july
were
produced
the
july
days
already
during
the
session
of
the
executive
committee
we
were
informed
by
telephone
that
a
regiment
of
was
making
ready
for
attack
by
telephone
too
we
adopted
measures
to
check
these
preparations
but
the
ferment
was
working
among
the
people
representatives
of
military
units
that
had
been
disciplined
for
insubordination
brought
alarming
news
from
the
front
of
repressions
which
aroused
the
garrison
among
the
petrograd
workingmen
the
displeasure
with
the
official
leaders
was
intensified
also
by
the
fact
that
tseretelli
dan
and
cheidze
misrepresented
the
general
views
of
the
proletariat
in
their
endeavor
to
prevent
the
petrograd
soviet
from
becoming
the
mouthpiece
of
the
new
tendencies
of
the
toilers
the
executive
committee
formed
in
the
july
council
and
depending
upon
the
more
backward
provinces
put
the
petrograd
soviet
more
and
more
into
the
background
and
took
all
matters
into
its
own
hands
including
even
local
petrograd
affairs
a
clash
was
inevitable
the
workers
and
soldiers
pressed
from
below
vehemently
voiced
their
discontent
with
the
official
soviet
policies
and
demanded
greater
resolution
from
our
party
we
considered
that
in
view
of
the
backwardness
of
the
provinces
the
time
for
such
a
course
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
same
time
we
feared
that
the
events
taking
place
at
the
front
might
bring
extreme
chaos
into
the
revolutionary
ranks
and
desperation
to
the
hearts
of
the
people
the
attitude
of
our
party
toward
the
movement
of
july
was
quite
well
defined
on
the
one
hand
there
was
the
danger
that
petrograd
might
break
away
from
the
more
backward
parts
of
the
country
while
on
the
other
there
was
the
feeling
that
only
the
active
and
energetic
intervention
of
petrograd
could
save
the
day
the
party
agitators
who
worked
among
the
people
were
working
in
harmony
with
the
masses
conducting
an
uncompromising
campaign
there
was
still
some
hope
that
the
demonstration
of
the
revolutionary
masses
in
the
streets
might
destroy
the
blind
doctrinairism
of
the
coalitionists
and
make
them
understand
that
they
could
retain
their
power
only
by
breaking
openly
with
the
bourgeoisie
despite
all
that
had
recently
been
said
and
written
in
the
bourgeois
press
our
party
had
no
intention
whatever
of
seizing
power
by
means
of
an
armed
revolt
in
point
of
fact
the
revolutionary
demonstration
started
spontaneously
and
was
guided
by
us
only
in
a
political
way
the
central
executive
committee
was
holding
its
session
in
the
taurida
palace
when
turbulent
crowds
of
armed
soldiers
and
workmen
surrounded
it
from
all
sides
among
them
was
of
course
an
insignificant
number
of
anarchistic
elements
which
were
ready
to
use
their
arms
against
the
soviet
center
there
were
also
some
pogrom
elements
elements
and
obviously
mercenary
elements
seeking
to
utilize
the
occasion
for
instigating
pogroms
and
chaos
from
among
the
sundry
elements
came
the
demands
for
the
arrest
of
chernoff
and
tseretelli
for
the
dispersal
of
the
executive
committee
etc
an
attempt
was
even
made
to
arrest
chernoff
subsequently
at
kresty
i
identified
one
of
the
sailors
who
had
participated
in
this
attempt
he
was
a
criminal
imprisoned
at
kresty
for
robbery
but
the
bourgeois
and
the
coalitionist
press
represented
this
movement
as
a
pogromist
affair
and
at
the
same
time
as
a
bolshevist
crusade
the
immediate
object
of
which
was
to
seize
the
reins
of
government
by
the
use
of
armed
force
against
the
central
executive
committee
the
movement
of
july
had
already
disclosed
with
perfect
clearness
that
a
complete
impotence
reigned
within
the
ruling
soviet
parties
at
petrograd
the
garrison
was
far
from
being
all
on
our
side
there
were
still
some
wavering
undecided
passive
elements
but
if
we
should
ignore
the
junkers
there
were
no
regiments
at
all
which
were
ready
to
fight
us
in
the
defense
of
the
government
or
the
leading
soviet
parties
it
was
necessary
to
summon
troops
from
the
front
the
entire
strategy
of
tseretelli
chernoff
and
others
on
the
of
july
resolved
itself
into
this
to
gain
time
in
order
to
give
kerensky
an
opportunity
to
bring
up
his
loyal
regiments
one
deputation
after
another
entered
the
hall
of
the
taurida
palace
which
was
surrounded
by
armed
crowds
and
demanded
a
complete
separation
from
the
bourgeoisie
positive
social
reforms
and
the
opening
of
peace
negotiations
we
the
bolsheviki
met
every
new
company
of
disgruntled
troops
gathered
in
the
yards
and
streets
with
speeches
in
which
we
called
upon
them
to
be
calm
and
assured
them
that
in
view
of
the
present
temper
of
the
people
the
coalitionists
could
not
succeed
in
forming
a
new
coalition
especially
pronounced
was
the
temper
of
the
kronstadt
sailors
whom
we
had
to
restrain
from
transcending
the
limits
of
a
peaceful
demonstration
the
fourth
demonstration
which
was
already
controlled
by
our
party
assumed
a
still
more
serious
character
the
soviet
leaders
were
quite
at
sea
their
speeches
assumed
an
evasive
character
the
answers
given
by
cheidze
to
the
deputies
were
without
any
political
content
it
was
clear
that
the
official
leaders
were
marking
time
on
the
night
of
the
the
loyal
regiments
began
to
arrive
during
the
session
of
the
executive
committee
the
taurida
palace
resounded
to
the
strains
of
the
marseillaise
the
expression
on
the
faces
of
the
leaders
suddenly
changed
they
displayed
a
look
of
confidence
which
had
been
entirely
wanting
of
late
it
was
produced
by
the
entry
into
the
taurida
palace
of
the
volynsk
regiment
the
same
one
which
a
few
months
later
was
to
lead
the
vanguard
of
the
october
revolution
under
our
banners
from
this
moment
everything
changed
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
handle
the
delegates
of
the
petrograd
workmen
and
soldiers
with
kid
gloves
speeches
were
made
from
the
floor
of
the
executive
committee
which
referred
to
an
armed
insurrection
that
had
been
suppressed
on
that
very
day
by
loyal
revolutionary
forces
the
bolsheviki
were
declared
to
be
a
party
the
fear
experienced
by
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
during
the
two
days
of
armed
demonstration
betrayed
itself
in
a
hatred
that
was
crystallized
not
only
in
the
columns
of
the
newspapers
but
also
in
the
streets
of
petrograd
and
more
especially
on
the
nevsky
prospect
where
individual
workmen
and
soldiers
caught
in
the
act
of
criminal
agitation
were
mercilessly
beaten
up
the
junkers
policemen
and
the
georgian
cavaliers
were
now
the
masters
of
the
situation
and
all
these
were
headed
by
the
savage
the
organizations
and
establishments
of
our
party
were
being
ruthlessly
crushed
and
demolished
arrests
searches
assaults
and
even
murders
came
to
be
common
occurrences
on
the
night
of
the
the
then
pereverzev
handed
over
to
the
press
documents
which
were
intended
to
prove
that
the
bolshevist
party
was
headed
by
bribed
agents
of
germany
the
leaders
of
the
and
menshevik
parties
have
known
us
too
long
and
too
well
to
believe
these
accusations
at
the
same
time
they
were
too
deeply
interested
in
their
success
to
repudiate
them
publicly
and
even
now
one
can
not
recall
without
disgust
that
saturnalia
of
lies
which
was
celebrated
broadcast
in
all
the
bourgeois
and
coalition
newspapers
our
organs
were
suppressed
revolutionary
petrograd
felt
that
the
provinces
and
the
army
were
still
far
from
being
with
it
in
workingmen
sections
of
the
city
a
short
period
of
tyrannical
infringements
set
in
while
in
the
garrison
repressive
measures
were
introduced
against
the
disorganized
regiments
and
certain
of
its
units
were
disarmed
at
the
same
time
the
political
leaders
manufactured
a
new
ministry
with
the
inclusion
of
representatives
of
bourgeois
groups
which
although
adding
nothing
to
the
government
robbed
it
of
its
last
vestige
of
revolutionary
initiative
meanwhile
events
at
the
front
ran
their
own
course
the
organic
unity
of
the
army
was
shaken
to
its
very
depths
the
soldiers
were
becoming
convinced
that
the
great
majority
of
the
officers
who
at
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
bedaubed
themselves
with
red
revolutionary
paint
were
still
very
inimical
to
the
new
regime
an
open
selection
of
elements
was
being
made
in
the
lines
bolshevik
publications
were
ruthlessly
persecuted
the
military
advance
had
long
ago
changed
into
a
tragic
retreat
the
bourgeois
press
madly
libelled
the
army
whereas
on
the
eve
of
the
advance
the
ruling
parties
told
us
that
we
were
an
insignificant
gang
and
that
the
army
had
never
heard
of
us
and
would
not
have
anything
to
do
with
us
now
when
the
gamble
of
the
drive
had
ended
so
disastrously
these
same
persons
and
parties
laid
the
whole
blame
for
its
failure
on
our
shoulders
the
prisons
were
crowded
with
revolutionary
workers
and
soldiers
all
the
old
legal
bloodhounds
of
czarism
were
employed
in
investigating
the
july
affair
under
these
circumstances
the
and
the
alensheviki
went
so
far
as
to
demand
that
lenin
zinoviev
and
others
of
their
group
should
surrender
themselves
to
the
courts
of
justice
the
events
following
the
july
days
the
infringements
of
liberty
in
the
quarters
lasted
but
a
little
while
and
were
followed
by
accessions
of
revolutionary
spirit
not
only
among
the
proletariat
but
also
in
the
petrograd
garrison
the
coalitionists
were
losing
all
influence
the
wave
of
bolshevism
began
to
spread
from
the
urban
centers
to
every
part
of
the
country
and
despite
all
obstacles
penetrated
into
the
army
ranks
the
new
coalition
government
with
kerensky
at
its
head
had
already
openly
embarked
upon
a
policy
of
repression
the
ministry
had
restored
the
death
penalty
in
the
army
our
papers
were
suppressed
and
our
agitators
were
arrested
but
this
only
increased
our
influence
in
spite
of
all
the
obstacles
involved
in
the
new
elections
for
the
petrograd
soviet
the
distribution
of
power
in
it
had
become
so
changed
that
on
certain
important
questions
we
already
commanded
a
majority
vote
the
same
was
the
case
in
the
moscow
soviet
at
that
time
i
together
with
many
others
was
imprisoned
at
kresty
having
been
arrested
for
instigating
and
organizing
the
armed
revolt
of
july
in
collusion
with
the
german
authorities
and
with
the
object
of
furthering
the
military
ends
of
the
hohenzollerns
the
famous
prosecutor
of
the
czarist
regime
aleksandrov
who
had
prosecuted
numerous
revolutionists
was
now
entrusted
with
the
task
of
protecting
the
public
from
the
bolsheviki
under
the
old
regime
the
inmates
of
prisons
used
to
be
divided
into
political
prisoners
and
criminals
now
a
new
terminology
was
established
criminals
and
bolsheviks
great
perplexity
reigned
among
the
imprisoned
soldiers
the
boys
came
from
the
country
and
had
previously
taken
no
part
in
political
life
they
thought
that
the
revolution
had
set
them
free
once
and
for
all
hence
they
viewed
with
amazement
their
doorlocks
and
grated
windows
while
taking
their
exercise
in
the
they
would
always
ask
me
what
all
this
meant
and
how
it
would
end
i
comforted
them
with
the
hope
of
our
ultimate
victory
toward
the
end
of
august
occurred
the
revolt
of
korniloff
this
was
the
immediate
result
of
the
mobilization
of
the
forces
to
which
a
forceful
impulse
had
been
imparted
by
the
attack
of
july
at
the
celebrated
moscow
congress
which
took
place
in
the
middle
of
august
kerensky
attempted
to
take
a
middle
ground
between
the
propertied
elements
and
the
democracy
of
the
small
bourgeoisie
the
maximalists
were
on
the
whole
considered
as
standing
beyond
the
bounds
of
the
legal
kerensky
threatened
them
with
blood
and
iron
which
met
with
vehement
applause
from
the
propertied
half
of
the
gathering
and
treacherous
silence
on
the
part
of
the
bourgeois
democracy
but
the
hysterical
outcries
and
threats
of
kerensky
did
not
satisfy
the
chiefs
of
the
interests
they
had
only
too
clearly
observed
the
revolutionary
tide
flooding
every
portion
of
the
country
among
the
working
class
in
the
villages
in
the
army
and
they
considered
it
imperative
to
adopt
without
any
delay
the
most
extreme
measures
to
curb
the
masses
after
reaching
an
understanding
with
the
bourgeoisie
who
saw
in
him
their
hero
korniloff
took
it
upon
himself
to
accomplish
this
hazardous
task
kerensky
savinkoff
filonenko
and
other
of
the
government
or
class
participated
in
this
conspiracy
but
each
and
every
one
of
them
at
a
certain
stage
of
the
altering
circumstances
betrayed
korniloff
for
they
knew
that
in
the
case
of
his
defeat
they
would
turn
out
to
have
been
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
fence
we
lived
through
the
events
connected
with
korniloff
while
we
were
in
jail
and
followed
them
in
the
newspapers
the
unhindered
delivery
of
newspapers
was
the
only
important
respect
in
which
the
jails
of
kerensky
differed
from
those
of
the
old
regime
the
cossack
general
adventure
miscarried
six
months
of
revolution
had
created
in
the
consciousness
of
the
masses
and
in
their
organization
a
sufficient
resistance
against
an
open
attack
the
conciliable
soviet
parties
were
terribly
frightened
at
the
prospect
of
the
possible
results
of
the
korniloff
conspiracy
which
threatened
to
sweep
away
not
only
the
maximalists
but
also
the
whole
revolution
together
with
its
governing
parties
the
and
the
minimalists
proceeded
to
legalize
the
maximalists
this
to
be
sure
only
retrospectively
and
only
inasmuch
as
they
scented
possible
dangers
in
the
future
the
very
same
kronstadt
sailors
whom
they
had
dubbed
burglars
and
in
the
days
following
the
july
uprising
were
summoned
during
the
korniloff
danger
to
petrograd
for
the
defence
of
the
revolution
they
came
without
a
murmur
without
a
word
of
reproach
without
recalling
the
past
and
occupied
the
most
responsible
posts
i
had
the
fullest
right
to
recall
to
tseretelli
these
words
which
i
had
addressed
to
him
in
may
when
he
was
occupied
in
persecuting
the
kronstadt
sailors
when
a
general
attempts
to
throw
the
noose
around
the
neck
of
the
revolution
the
cadets
will
grease
the
rope
with
soap
while
the
kronstadt
sailors
will
come
to
fight
and
die
together
with
us
the
soviet
organizations
had
revealed
everywhere
in
the
rear
and
at
the
front
their
vitality
and
their
power
in
the
struggle
with
the
korniloff
uprising
in
almost
no
instance
did
things
ever
come
to
a
military
conflict
the
revolutionary
masses
ground
into
nothingness
the
conspiracy
just
as
the
moderates
in
july
found
no
soldiers
among
the
petrograd
garrison
to
fight
against
us
so
now
korniloff
found
no
soldiers
on
the
whole
front
to
fight
against
the
revolution
he
had
acted
by
virtue
of
a
delusion
and
the
words
of
our
propaganda
easily
destroyed
his
designs
according
to
information
in
the
newspapers
i
had
expected
a
more
rapid
unfolding
of
subsequent
events
in
the
direction
of
the
passing
of
the
power
into
the
hands
of
the
soviets
the
growth
of
the
influence
and
power
of
the
maximalists
became
indubitable
and
had
gained
an
irresistable
momentum
the
maximalists
had
warned
against
the
coalition
against
the
attack
of
the
of
july
they
predicted
the
korniloff
affair
the
masses
of
the
people
became
convinced
by
experience
that
we
were
right
during
the
most
terrifying
moments
of
the
korniloff
conspiracy
when
the
caucasian
division
was
approaching
petrograd
the
petrograd
soviet
was
arming
the
workingmen
with
the
extorted
consent
of
the
authorities
army
divisions
which
had
been
brought
up
against
us
had
long
since
achieved
their
successful
rebirth
in
the
stimulating
atmosphere
of
petrograd
and
were
now
altogether
on
our
side
the
korniloff
uprising
was
destined
to
open
definitely
the
eyes
of
the
army
to
the
inadmissibility
of
any
continued
policy
of
conciliation
with
the
bourgeois
hence
it
was
possible
to
expect
that
the
crushing
of
the
korniloff
uprising
would
prove
to
be
only
an
introduction
to
an
immediate
aggressive
action
on
the
part
of
the
revolutionary
forces
under
the
leadership
of
our
party
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
sole
power
but
events
unfolded
more
slowly
with
all
the
tension
of
their
revolutionary
feeling
the
masses
had
become
more
cautious
after
the
bitter
lesson
of
the
july
days
and
renounced
all
isolated
demonstrations
awaiting
a
direct
instruction
and
direction
from
above
and
also
among
the
leadership
of
our
party
there
developed
a
policy
under
these
circumstances
the
liquidation
of
the
korniloff
adventure
irrespective
of
the
profound
regrouping
of
forces
to
our
advantage
did
not
bring
about
any
immediate
political
changes
the
conflict
with
the
soviets
in
the
petrograd
soviet
the
domination
of
our
party
was
definitely
strengthened
from
that
time
on
this
was
evidenced
in
dramatic
fashion
when
the
question
of
the
personnel
of
its
presiding
body
came
up
at
that
epoch
when
the
and
the
minimalists
were
holding
sway
in
the
soviets
they
isolated
the
maximalists
by
every
means
in
their
power
they
did
not
admit
even
one
maximalist
into
the
membership
of
the
executive
committee
at
petrograd
even
when
our
party
represented
at
least
of
all
the
soviet
members
afterwards
when
the
petrograd
soviet
by
a
dwindling
majority
passed
the
resolution
for
the
transfering
of
all
power
into
the
hands
of
the
soviet
our
party
put
forth
the
demand
to
establish
a
coalition
executive
committee
formed
on
a
proportional
basis
the
old
presiding
body
the
members
of
which
were
cheidze
tseretelli
kerensky
skobeloff
chernoff
flatly
refused
this
demand
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
mention
this
here
inasmuch
as
representatives
of
the
parties
broken
up
by
the
revolution
speak
of
the
necessity
of
presenting
one
front
for
the
sake
of
democracy
and
accuse
us
of
separatism
there
was
called
at
that
time
a
special
meeting
of
the
petrograd
soviet
which
was
to
decide
the
question
of
the
presiding
body
fate
all
forces
all
reserves
had
been
mobilized
on
both
sides
tseretelli
came
out
with
a
speech
embodying
a
programme
wherein
he
pointed
out
that
the
question
of
the
presiding
body
was
a
question
of
orientation
we
reckoned
that
we
would
sway
somewhat
less
than
half
of
the
vote
and
were
ready
to
consider
that
a
sign
of
our
progress
actually
however
the
vote
showed
that
we
had
a
majority
of
nearly
one
hundred
for
six
months
said
tseretelli
at
that
time
we
have
stood
at
the
head
of
the
petrograd
soviet
and
led
it
from
victory
to
victory
we
wish
that
you
may
hold
for
at
least
half
of
that
time
the
positions
which
you
are
now
preparing
to
occupy
in
the
moscow
soviet
a
similar
change
of
leadership
among
the
parties
took
place
one
after
the
other
the
provincial
soviets
joined
the
bolshevik
position
the
date
of
convoking
the
second
congress
of
soviets
was
approaching
but
the
leading
group
of
the
central
executive
committee
was
striving
with
all
its
might
to
put
off
the
congress
to
an
indefinite
future
time
in
order
thus
to
destroy
it
in
advance
it
was
evident
that
the
new
congress
of
soviets
would
give
our
party
a
majority
would
correspondingly
alter
the
of
the
central
executive
committee
and
deprive
the
fusionists
of
their
most
important
position
the
struggle
for
the
convocation
of
the
congress
of
soviets
assumed
the
greatest
importance
for
us
to
counterbalance
this
the
mensheviks
minimalists
and
the
put
forth
the
democratic
conference
idea
they
needed
this
move
against
both
us
and
kerensky
by
this
time
the
head
of
the
ministry
assumed
an
absolutely
independent
and
irresponsible
position
he
had
been
raised
to
power
by
the
petrograd
soviet
during
the
first
epoch
of
the
revolution
kerensky
had
entered
the
ministry
without
a
preliminary
decision
of
the
soviets
but
his
admission
was
subsequently
approved
after
the
first
congress
of
soviets
the
socialist
ministers
were
held
accountable
to
the
central
executive
committee
their
allies
the
cadets
constitutional
democrats
were
responsible
only
to
their
party
to
meet
the
bourgeoisie
wishes
the
general
executive
committee
after
the
july
days
released
the
socialist
ministers
from
all
responsibility
to
the
soviets
in
order
as
it
were
to
create
a
revolutionary
dictatorship
it
is
rather
well
to
mention
this
too
now
that
the
same
persons
who
built
up
the
dictatorship
of
a
coterie
come
forth
with
accusations
and
imprecations
against
the
dictatorship
of
a
class
the
moscow
conference
at
which
the
skilfully
manipulated
professional
and
democratic
elements
balanced
each
other
aimed
to
strengthen
kerensky
power
over
classes
and
parties
this
aim
was
attained
only
in
appearance
in
reality
the
moscow
conference
revealed
kerensky
utter
impotence
for
he
was
equally
remote
from
both
the
professional
elements
and
the
bourgeois
democracy
but
since
the
liberals
and
conservatives
applauded
his
onslaughts
against
democracy
and
the
fusionists
gave
him
ovations
when
he
cautiously
upbraided
the
the
impression
was
growing
upon
him
that
he
was
supported
as
it
were
by
both
the
former
and
the
latter
and
accordingly
commanded
unlimited
power
over
workingmen
and
revolutionary
soldiers
he
held
the
threat
of
blood
and
iron
his
policy
continued
the
bargaining
with
korniloff
behind
the
scenes
a
bargaining
which
compromised
him
even
in
the
fusionists
eyes
in
evasively
diplomatic
terms
so
characteristic
of
him
tseretelli
spoke
of
personal
movements
in
politics
and
of
the
necessity
of
curbing
these
personal
movements
this
task
was
to
be
accomplished
by
the
democratic
conference
which
was
called
according
to
arbitrary
forms
from
among
representatives
of
soviets
dumas
zemstvos
professional
trade
unions
and
societies
still
the
main
task
was
to
secure
a
sufficiently
conservative
composition
of
the
conference
to
dissolve
the
soviets
once
for
all
in
the
formless
mass
of
democracy
and
on
the
new
organizational
basis
to
gain
a
firm
footing
against
the
bolshevik
tide
here
it
will
not
be
out
of
place
to
note
in
a
few
words
the
difference
between
the
political
role
of
the
soviets
and
that
of
the
democratic
organs
of
more
than
once
the
philistines
called
our
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
new
dumas
and
zemstvos
elected
on
the
basis
of
universal
suffrage
were
incomparably
more
democratic
than
the
soviets
and
were
more
suited
to
represent
the
population
however
this
formal
democratic
criterion
is
devoid
of
serious
content
in
a
revolutionary
epoch
the
significance
of
the
revolution
lies
in
the
rapid
changing
of
the
judgment
of
the
masses
in
the
fact
that
new
and
ever
new
strata
of
population
acquire
experience
verify
their
views
of
the
day
before
sweep
them
aside
work
out
new
ones
desert
old
leaders
and
follow
new
ones
in
the
forward
march
during
revolutionary
times
formally
democratic
organizations
based
upon
the
ponderous
apparatus
of
universal
suffrage
inevitably
fall
behind
the
development
of
the
political
consciousness
of
the
masses
quite
different
are
the
soviets
they
rely
immediately
upon
organic
groupings
such
as
shop
mill
factory
volost
regiment
etc
to
be
sure
there
are
guarantees
just
as
legal
of
the
strictness
of
elections
as
are
used
in
creating
democratic
dumas
and
zemstvos
but
there
are
in
the
soviet
incomparably
more
serious
more
profound
guarantees
of
the
direct
and
immediate
relation
between
the
deputy
and
the
electors
a
or
zemstvo
member
is
supported
by
the
amorphous
mass
of
electors
which
entrusts
its
full
powers
to
him
for
a
year
and
then
breaks
up
the
soviet
electors
remain
always
united
by
the
conditions
of
their
work
and
their
existence
the
deputy
is
ever
before
their
eyes
at
any
moment
they
can
prepare
a
mandate
to
him
censure
him
recall
or
replace
him
with
another
person
if
during
the
revolutionary
month
preceding
the
general
political
evolution
expressed
itself
in
the
fact
that
the
influence
of
the
fusionist
parties
was
being
replaced
by
a
decisive
influence
of
the
bolsheviki
it
is
quite
plain
that
this
process
found
its
most
striking
and
fullest
expression
in
the
soviets
while
the
dumas
and
zemstvos
notwithstanding
all
their
formal
democratism
expressed
status
of
the
popular
masses
and
not
this
is
exactly
what
explains
the
gravitation
toward
dumas
and
zemstvos
on
the
part
of
those
parties
which
were
losing
more
and
more
ground
in
the
esteem
of
the
revolutionary
class
we
shall
meet
with
the
same
question
only
on
a
larger
scale
later
when
we
come
to
the
constituent
assembly
the
democratic
conference
the
democratic
conference
called
by
tseretelli
and
his
in
was
totally
artificial
in
character
representing
as
it
did
a
combination
of
soviets
and
organs
of
in
a
ratio
calculated
to
secure
a
preponderance
of
the
fusionist
parties
born
of
helplessness
and
confusion
the
conference
ended
in
a
pitiful
fiasco
the
professional
bourgeoisie
treated
the
conference
with
the
greatest
hostility
beholding
in
it
an
endeavor
to
push
the
bourgeoisie
away
from
the
positions
it
had
approached
at
the
moscow
conference
the
revolutionary
proletariat
and
the
masses
of
soldiers
and
peasants
connected
with
it
condemned
in
advance
the
fraudulent
method
of
calling
together
the
democratic
conference
the
immediate
task
of
the
fusionists
was
to
create
a
responsible
ministry
but
even
this
was
not
achieved
kerensky
neither
wanted
nor
permitted
responsibility
because
this
was
not
permitted
by
the
bourgeoisie
which
was
backing
him
irresponsibility
towards
the
organs
of
the
democracy
meant
in
fact
responsibility
to
the
cadets
and
the
allied
embassies
for
the
time
being
this
was
sufficient
for
the
bourgeoisie
on
the
question
of
coalition
the
democratic
conference
revealed
its
utter
insolvency
the
votes
in
favor
of
a
coalition
with
the
bourgeoisie
slightly
outnumbered
those
against
the
coalition
the
majority
voted
against
a
coalition
with
the
cadets
but
with
the
cadets
left
out
there
proved
to
be
among
the
bourgeoisie
no
serious
for
the
coalition
tseretelli
explained
this
in
detail
to
the
conference
if
the
conference
did
not
grasp
it
so
much
the
worse
for
the
conference
behind
the
backs
of
the
conference
negotiations
were
carried
on
without
concealment
with
the
cadets
whom
they
had
repudiated
and
it
was
decided
that
the
cadets
should
not
appear
as
cadets
but
as
social
workers
pressed
hard
on
both
right
and
left
the
bourgeois
democracy
tolerated
all
this
dickering
and
thereby
demonstrated
its
utter
political
prostration
from
the
democratic
conference
a
soviet
was
picked
and
it
was
decided
to
complete
it
by
adding
representatives
of
the
professional
elements
this
was
to
fill
the
vacant
period
before
the
convocation
of
the
constituent
assembly
contrary
to
tseretelli
original
plan
but
in
full
accord
with
the
plans
of
the
bourgeoisie
the
new
coalition
ministry
retained
its
formal
independence
with
regard
to
the
everything
together
produced
the
impression
of
a
pitiful
and
impotent
creation
of
an
office
clerk
behind
which
was
concealed
the
complete
capitulation
of
the
petty
bourgeois
democracy
before
the
professional
liberalism
which
a
month
previously
had
openly
supported
korniloff
attack
on
the
revolution
the
sum
total
of
the
whole
affair
was
therefore
the
restoration
and
perpetuation
of
the
coalition
with
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
no
longer
could
there
be
any
doubt
that
quite
independently
of
the
of
the
future
constituent
assembly
the
governmental
power
would
in
fact
be
held
by
the
bourgeoisie
as
despite
all
the
preponderance
given
them
by
the
masses
of
the
people
the
fusionist
parties
invariably
arrived
at
a
coalition
with
the
cadets
deeming
it
impossible
as
they
did
to
create
a
state
power
without
the
bourgeoisie
the
attitude
of
the
masses
toward
milyukov
party
was
one
of
the
deepest
hostility
at
all
elections
during
the
revolutionary
period
the
cadets
suffered
merciless
defeat
and
yet
the
very
parties
the
and
mensheviks
which
victoriously
defeated
the
cadet
party
at
the
elections
after
election
gave
it
the
place
of
honor
in
the
coalition
government
it
is
natural
that
the
masses
realized
more
and
more
that
in
reality
the
fusionist
parties
were
playing
the
role
of
stewards
to
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
meantime
the
internal
situation
was
becoming
more
and
more
complicated
and
unfavorable
the
war
dragged
on
aimlessly
senselessly
and
interminably
the
government
took
no
steps
whatever
to
extricate
itself
from
the
vicious
circle
the
laughable
scheme
was
proposed
of
sending
the
menshevik
skobeloff
to
paris
to
influence
the
allied
imperialists
but
no
sane
man
attached
any
importance
to
this
scheme
korniloff
gave
up
riga
to
the
germans
in
order
to
terrorize
public
opinion
and
having
brought
about
this
condition
to
establish
the
discipline
of
the
knout
in
the
army
danger
threatened
petrograd
and
the
bourgeois
elements
greeted
this
peril
with
unconcealed
malicious
joy
the
former
president
of
the
duma
rodzyanko
openly
said
again
and
again
that
the
surrender
of
debauched
petrograd
to
the
germans
would
not
be
a
great
misfortune
for
illustration
he
cited
riga
where
the
deputy
soviets
had
been
done
away
with
after
the
coming
of
the
germans
and
firm
order
together
with
the
old
police
system
had
been
established
would
the
baltic
fleet
be
lost
but
the
fleet
had
been
debauched
by
the
revolutionary
propaganda
ergo
the
loss
was
not
so
great
the
cynicism
of
a
garrulous
nobleman
expressed
the
hidden
thoughts
of
the
greater
part
of
the
bourgeoisie
that
to
surrender
petrograd
to
the
germans
did
not
mean
to
lose
it
under
the
peace
treaty
it
would
be
restored
but
restored
ravaged
by
german
militarism
by
that
time
the
revolution
would
be
decapitated
and
it
would
be
easier
to
manage
kerensky
government
did
not
think
of
seriously
defending
the
capital
on
the
contrary
public
opinion
was
being
prepared
for
its
possible
surrender
public
institutions
were
being
removed
from
petrograd
to
moscow
and
other
cities
in
this
setting
the
soldiers
section
of
the
petrograd
soviet
had
its
meeting
feeling
was
tense
and
turbulent
was
the
government
incapable
of
defending
petrograd
if
so
let
it
make
peace
and
if
incapable
of
making
peace
let
it
clear
out
the
frame
of
mind
of
the
section
found
expression
in
this
resolution
this
was
already
the
of
the
october
revolution
at
the
front
the
situation
grew
worse
day
by
day
chilly
autumn
with
its
rains
and
winds
was
drawing
nigh
and
there
was
looming
up
a
fourth
winter
campaign
supplies
deteriorated
every
day
in
the
rear
the
front
had
been
forgotten
no
reliefs
no
new
contingents
no
warm
winter
clothing
which
was
indispensable
desertions
grew
in
number
the
old
army
committees
elected
in
the
first
period
of
the
revolution
remained
at
their
places
and
supported
kerensky
policy
were
forbidden
an
abyss
sprang
up
between
the
committees
and
the
soldier
masses
finally
the
soldiers
began
to
regard
the
committees
with
hatred
with
increasing
frequency
delegates
from
the
trenches
were
arriving
in
petrograd
and
at
the
sessions
of
the
petrograd
soviet
put
the
question
point
blank
what
is
to
be
done
further
by
whom
and
how
will
the
war
be
ended
why
is
the
petrograd
soviet
silent
inevitability
of
the
struggle
for
power
the
petrograd
soviet
was
not
silent
it
demanded
the
immediate
transfer
of
all
power
into
the
hands
of
the
soviets
in
the
capitals
and
in
the
provinces
the
immediate
transfer
of
the
land
to
the
peasants
the
workingmen
control
of
production
and
immediate
opening
of
peace
negotiations
so
long
as
we
remained
an
opposition
party
the
motto
all
power
to
the
soviets
was
a
propaganda
motto
but
as
soon
as
we
found
ourselves
in
the
majority
in
all
the
principal
soviets
this
motto
imposed
upon
us
the
duty
of
a
direct
and
immediate
fight
for
power
in
the
country
villages
the
situation
had
grown
entangled
and
complicated
in
the
extreme
the
revolution
had
promised
land
to
the
peasant
but
at
the
same
time
the
leading
parties
demanded
that
the
peasant
should
not
touch
this
land
until
the
constituent
assembly
should
meet
at
first
the
peasants
waited
patiently
but
when
they
began
to
lose
patience
the
coalition
ministry
showered
repressive
measures
upon
them
meanwhile
the
constituent
assembly
was
receding
to
ever
remoter
distances
the
bourgeoisie
insisted
upon
calling
the
constituent
assembly
after
the
conclusion
of
peace
the
peasant
masses
were
growing
more
and
more
impatient
what
we
had
foretold
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
revolution
was
being
realized
the
peasants
were
seizing
the
land
of
their
own
accord
repressive
measures
grew
arrests
of
revolutionary
land
committees
began
in
certain
uyezds
districts
kerensky
introduced
martial
law
a
line
of
delegates
who
came
on
foot
flowed
from
the
villages
to
the
petrograd
soviet
they
complained
that
they
had
been
arrested
when
they
attempted
to
carry
out
the
petrograd
programme
and
to
transfer
the
estate
holder
land
into
the
hands
of
the
peasant
committees
the
peasants
demanded
protection
of
us
we
replied
that
we
should
be
in
a
position
to
protect
them
only
if
the
power
were
in
our
hands
from
this
however
it
followed
that
the
soviets
must
seize
the
power
if
they
did
not
wish
to
become
mere
debating
societies
it
is
senseless
to
fight
for
the
power
of
the
soviets
six
or
eight
weeks
before
the
constituent
assembly
our
neighbors
on
the
right
told
us
we
however
were
in
no
degree
infected
with
this
fetish
worship
of
the
constituent
assembly
in
the
first
place
there
were
no
guarantees
that
it
really
would
be
called
the
breaking
up
of
the
army
mass
desertions
disorganization
of
the
supplies
department
agrarian
revolution
all
this
created
an
environment
which
was
unfavorable
to
the
elections
for
the
constituent
assembly
the
surrender
of
petrograd
to
the
germans
furthermore
threatened
to
remove
altogether
the
question
of
elections
from
the
order
of
the
day
and
besides
even
if
it
were
called
according
to
the
old
registration
lists
under
the
leadership
of
the
old
parties
the
constituent
assembly
would
be
but
a
cover
and
a
sanction
for
the
coalition
power
without
the
bourgeoisie
neither
the
nor
the
mensheviks
were
in
a
position
to
assume
power
only
the
revolutionary
class
was
destined
to
break
the
vicious
circle
wherein
the
revolution
was
revolving
and
going
to
pieces
the
power
had
to
be
snatched
from
the
hands
of
the
elements
which
were
directly
or
indirectly
serving
the
bourgeoisie
and
making
use
of
the
state
apparatus
as
a
tool
of
obstruction
against
the
revolutionary
demands
of
the
people
all
power
to
the
soviets
demanded
our
party
translated
into
party
language
this
had
meant
in
the
preceding
period
the
power
of
the
and
mensheviks
as
opposed
to
a
coalition
with
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
now
in
october
the
same
motto
meant
handing
over
all
power
to
the
revolutionary
proletariat
at
the
head
of
which
at
this
period
stood
the
bolshevik
party
it
was
a
question
of
the
dictatorship
of
the
working
class
which
was
leading
or
more
correctly
was
capable
of
leading
the
many
millions
of
the
poorest
peasantry
this
was
the
historical
significance
of
the
october
uprising
everything
led
the
party
to
this
path
since
the
first
days
of
the
revolution
we
had
been
preaching
the
necessity
and
inevitability
of
the
power
passing
to
the
soviets
after
a
great
internal
struggle
the
majority
of
the
soviets
made
this
demand
their
own
having
accepted
our
point
of
view
we
were
preparing
the
second
congress
of
soviets
at
which
we
expected
our
party
complete
victory
under
leadership
the
cautious
cheidze
had
departed
for
the
caucasus
the
central
executive
committee
attempted
to
block
in
every
way
the
calling
of
the
congress
of
the
soviets
after
great
exertions
supported
by
the
soviet
fraction
of
the
democratic
assembly
we
finally
secured
the
setting
of
the
date
of
the
congress
for
october
this
date
was
destined
to
become
the
greatest
day
in
the
history
of
russia
as
a
preliminary
we
called
in
petrograd
a
congress
of
soviets
of
the
northern
regions
including
the
baltic
fleet
and
moscow
at
this
congress
we
had
a
solid
majority
and
obtained
a
certain
support
on
the
right
in
the
persons
of
the
left
faction
besides
laying
important
organizational
premises
for
the
october
uprising
the
conflict
regarding
the
petrograd
garrison
but
even
earlier
previous
to
the
congress
of
northern
soviets
there
occurred
an
event
which
was
destined
to
play
a
most
important
role
in
the
subsequent
political
struggle
early
in
october
there
came
to
a
meeting
of
the
petrograd
executive
committee
the
representative
in
the
staff
of
the
petrograd
military
district
and
announced
that
headquarters
demanded
that
of
the
petrograd
garrison
should
be
sent
to
the
front
for
what
purpose
to
defend
petrograd
they
were
not
to
be
sent
to
the
front
at
once
but
still
it
was
necessary
to
make
ready
immediately
the
staff
recommended
that
the
petrograd
soviet
approve
this
plan
we
were
on
our
guard
at
the
end
of
august
also
five
revolutionary
regiments
complete
or
in
parts
had
been
taken
out
of
petrograd
this
had
been
done
at
the
request
of
the
then
supreme
commander
korniloff
who
at
that
very
time
was
preparing
to
hurl
a
caucasian
division
against
petrograd
with
the
intention
of
once
for
all
settling
with
the
revolutionary
capital
thus
we
had
already
the
experience
of
purely
political
transfer
of
regiments
under
the
pretext
of
military
operations
anticipating
events
i
shall
say
that
from
documents
brought
to
light
after
the
october
revolution
it
became
clear
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
proposed
removal
of
the
petrograd
garrison
actually
had
nothing
to
do
with
military
purposes
but
was
forced
upon
dukhonin
against
his
will
by
none
else
but
kerensky
who
was
striving
to
clear
the
capital
of
the
most
revolutionary
soldiers
those
most
hostile
to
him
but
at
that
time
early
in
october
our
suspicions
evoked
at
first
a
storm
of
patriotic
indignation
the
staff
people
were
pressing
us
kerensky
was
impatient
for
the
ground
under
his
feet
had
grown
too
hot
we
on
the
other
hand
delayed
answering
danger
undoubtedly
threatened
petrograd
and
the
question
of
defending
the
capital
loomed
before
us
in
all
its
terrible
significance
but
after
the
korniloff
experience
after
rodzyanko
words
concerning
the
desirability
of
the
german
occupation
whence
should
we
take
the
assurance
that
petrograd
would
not
be
maliciously
given
up
to
the
germans
in
punishment
for
its
seditious
spirit
the
executive
committee
refused
to
affix
its
seal
blindly
to
the
order
to
transfer
of
the
garrison
it
was
necessary
to
verify
we
said
whether
there
really
were
military
considerations
back
of
this
order
and
therefore
it
was
necessary
to
create
an
organization
for
this
verification
thus
was
born
the
idea
of
creating
by
the
side
of
the
soldiers
section
of
the
soviet
the
garrison
political
representation
a
purely
military
organization
in
the
form
of
a
military
revolutionary
committee
which
subsequently
acquired
enormous
power
and
became
the
real
tool
of
the
october
revolution
undoubtedly
even
in
those
hours
when
putting
forth
the
idea
of
creating
an
organization
in
whose
hands
would
be
concentrated
the
threads
for
guiding
the
petrograd
garrison
on
the
purely
military
side
we
clearly
realized
that
this
very
organization
might
become
an
irreplaceable
revolutionary
tool
at
that
time
we
were
already
openly
heading
for
the
uprising
and
were
preparing
for
it
in
an
organized
way
as
indicated
above
the
congress
of
soviets
was
ret
for
october
there
could
be
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
congress
would
declare
itself
in
favor
of
power
being
handed
over
to
the
soviets
but
such
a
resolution
must
forthwith
be
put
into
actuality
else
it
would
turn
into
a
worthless
platonic
demonstration
the
logic
of
events
therefore
required
us
to
set
the
uprising
for
october
exactly
so
the
entire
bourgeois
press
interpreted
it
but
in
the
first
place
the
fate
of
the
congress
depended
upon
the
petrograd
garrison
would
it
allow
kerensky
to
surround
the
congress
of
soviets
and
disperse
it
with
the
assistance
of
several
hundred
or
thousand
military
cadets
ensigns
and
thugs
did
not
the
very
attempt
to
remove
the
garrison
mean
that
the
government
was
preparing
to
disperse
the
congress
of
soviets
and
strange
it
would
be
if
it
were
not
preparing
since
we
were
before
the
entire
land
openly
mobilizing
the
soviet
forces
in
order
to
deal
the
coalition
forces
a
death
blow
thus
the
conflict
at
petrograd
was
developing
on
the
basis
of
the
question
of
the
garrison
fate
first
and
foremost
this
question
touched
all
the
soldiers
to
the
quick
but
the
too
felt
the
liveliest
interest
in
the
conflict
fearing
as
they
did
that
upon
the
garrison
removal
they
would
be
smothered
by
the
cadets
and
cossacks
thus
the
conflict
was
assuming
a
character
of
the
very
keenest
nature
and
developing
on
a
soil
extremely
unfavorable
for
government
parallel
with
this
was
going
on
the
struggle
for
convoking
the
congress
of
soviets
we
openly
declaring
in
the
name
of
the
petrograd
soviet
and
the
northern
region
congress
that
the
second
congress
of
soviets
must
set
kerensky
government
aside
and
become
the
true
master
of
the
russian
land
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
uprising
was
already
on
it
was
developing
quite
openly
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
country
during
october
the
question
of
the
uprising
played
an
important
role
in
our
party
inner
life
lenin
who
was
in
hiding
in
finland
insisted
in
numerous
letters
upon
more
resolute
tactics
the
lower
strata
were
in
ferment
and
dissatisfaction
was
accumulating
because
the
bolshevik
party
which
had
proved
to
be
in
the
majority
in
the
petrograd
soviet
was
drawing
no
practical
conclusions
from
its
own
mottos
on
october
a
conspiratory
meeting
of
the
central
committee
of
our
party
took
place
with
lenin
present
the
question
of
the
uprising
was
on
the
order
of
the
day
by
a
majority
of
all
against
two
votes
it
was
decided
that
the
only
means
of
saving
the
revolution
and
the
country
from
final
dissolution
lay
in
armed
insurrection
which
must
transfer
power
into
the
hands
of
the
soviets
the
democratic
soviet
and
the
democratic
soviet
which
had
detached
itself
from
the
democratic
conference
had
absorbed
all
the
helplessness
of
the
latter
the
old
soviet
parties
the
and
the
mensheviks
had
created
an
artificial
majority
in
it
for
themselves
only
the
more
strikingly
to
reveal
their
political
prostration
behind
the
soviet
curtains
tseretelli
was
carrying
on
involved
parleys
with
kerensky
and
the
representatives
of
the
professional
elements
as
they
began
to
say
in
the
soviet
in
order
to
avoid
the
insulting
term
bourgeoisie
tseretelli
report
on
the
course
and
issue
of
the
negotiations
was
a
sort
of
funeral
oration
over
a
whole
period
of
the
revolution
it
turned
out
that
neither
kerensky
nor
the
professional
elements
had
consented
to
responsibility
toward
the
new
institution
on
the
other
hand
outside
the
limits
of
the
cadet
party
they
had
not
succeeded
in
finding
efficient
social
leaders
the
organizers
of
the
venture
had
to
capitulate
on
both
points
the
capitulation
was
all
the
more
eloquent
because
the
democratic
conference
had
been
called
exactly
for
the
purpose
of
doing
away
with
the
irresponsible
regime
while
the
conference
by
a
formal
vote
rejected
a
coalition
with
the
cadets
at
several
meetings
of
the
democratic
soviet
which
took
place
prior
to
the
revolution
there
prevailed
an
atmosphere
of
tenseness
and
utter
incapacity
for
action
the
soviet
did
not
reflect
the
revolution
march
forward
but
the
dissolution
of
the
parties
that
had
lagged
behind
the
revolution
even
previous
to
the
democratic
conference
in
our
party
faction
i
had
raised
the
question
of
demonstratively
withdrawing
from
the
conference
and
boycotting
the
democratic
soviet
it
was
necessary
to
show
the
masses
by
action
that
the
fusionists
had
led
the
revolution
into
a
blind
alley
the
fight
for
building
up
the
soviet
power
could
be
carried
on
only
in
a
revolutionary
way
the
power
must
be
snatched
from
the
hands
of
those
who
had
proven
incapable
of
doing
any
good
and
were
furthermore
even
losing
their
capacity
for
active
evil
their
method
of
working
through
an
artificially
picked
and
a
conjectural
constituent
assembly
had
to
be
opposed
by
our
political
method
of
mobilizing
the
forces
around
the
soviets
through
the
congress
of
soviets
and
through
insurrection
this
could
be
done
only
by
means
of
an
open
break
before
the
eyes
of
the
entire
people
with
the
body
created
by
tseretelli
and
his
adherents
and
by
focusing
on
the
soviet
institutions
the
entire
attention
and
all
the
forces
of
the
working
class
this
is
why
i
proposed
the
demonstrative
withdrawal
from
the
conference
and
a
revolutionary
agitation
in
shops
and
regiments
against
the
attempt
to
play
false
with
the
will
of
the
revolution
and
once
again
turn
its
progress
into
the
channel
of
cooperation
with
the
bourgeoisie
lenin
whose
letter
we
received
a
few
days
later
expressed
himself
to
the
same
effect
but
in
the
party
upper
circles
hesitation
was
still
apparent
on
this
question
the
july
days
had
left
a
deep
impression
in
the
party
consciousness
the
mass
of
workingmen
and
soldiers
had
recovered
from
the
july
debacle
much
more
rapidly
than
had
many
of
the
leading
comrades
who
feared
the
nipping
of
the
revolution
in
the
bud
by
a
new
premature
onslaught
of
the
masses
in
our
group
of
the
democratic
conference
i
mustered
votes
in
favor
of
my
proposal
against
who
declared
for
participating
in
the
democratic
council
however
the
experience
of
this
participation
soon
strengthened
the
party
left
wing
it
was
growing
too
manifest
that
combinations
bordering
on
trickery
combinations
that
aimed
at
securing
further
leadership
in
the
revolution
for
the
professional
elements
with
the
assistance
of
the
fusionists
who
had
lost
ground
among
the
lower
levels
of
the
people
offered
no
escape
from
the
impasse
into
which
the
laxness
of
bourgeois
democracy
had
driven
the
revolution
by
the
time
the
democratic
soviet
its
ranks
filled
up
with
professional
elements
became
a
readiness
to
break
with
this
institution
had
matured
in
our
party
the
and
mensheviks
we
were
confronted
with
the
question
whether
the
would
follow
us
in
this
path
this
group
was
in
the
process
of
formation
but
this
process
according
to
the
standards
of
our
party
went
on
too
slowly
and
irresolutely
at
the
outset
of
the
revolution
the
proved
the
predominating
party
in
the
whole
field
of
political
life
peasants
soldiers
even
workingmen
voted
en
masse
for
the
the
party
itself
had
not
expected
anything
of
the
kind
and
more
than
once
it
looked
as
if
it
were
in
danger
of
being
swamped
in
the
waves
of
its
own
success
excluding
the
purely
capitalistic
and
landholder
groups
and
the
professional
elements
among
the
intellectuals
one
and
all
voted
for
the
revolutionary
populists
party
this
was
natural
in
the
initial
stage
of
the
revolution
when
class
lines
had
not
had
time
to
reveal
themselves
when
the
aspirations
of
the
united
revolutionary
front
found
expression
in
the
diffuse
program
of
a
party
that
was
ready
to
welcome
equally
the
workingman
who
feared
to
break
away
from
the
peasant
the
peasant
who
was
seeking
land
and
liberty
the
intellectual
attempting
to
guide
both
of
them
the
chinovnik
officeholder
endeavoring
to
adjust
himself
to
the
new
regime
when
kerensky
who
had
been
counted
a
laborite
in
the
period
of
czarism
joined
the
party
after
the
victory
of
the
revolution
that
party
popularity
began
to
grow
in
proportion
as
kerensky
mounted
the
rungs
of
power
out
of
respect
not
always
of
a
platonic
nature
for
the
war
minister
many
colonels
and
generals
hastened
to
enrol
in
the
party
of
the
erstwhile
terrorists
old
with
revolutionary
traditions
regarded
with
some
uneasiness
the
ever
increasing
number
of
march
that
is
such
party
members
as
had
discovered
within
themselves
a
revolutionary
populist
soul
only
in
march
after
the
revolution
had
overthrown
the
old
regime
and
placed
the
revolutionary
populists
in
authority
thus
within
the
limits
of
its
formlessness
this
party
contained
not
only
the
inner
contradictions
of
the
developing
revolution
but
also
the
prejudices
inherent
in
the
backwardness
of
the
peasant
masses
and
the
sentimentalism
instability
and
of
the
intellectual
strata
it
was
perfectly
clear
that
in
that
form
the
party
could
not
last
long
with
regard
to
ideas
it
proved
impotent
from
the
very
start
politically
the
guiding
role
belonged
to
the
mensheviks
who
had
gone
through
the
school
of
marxism
and
derived
from
it
certain
procedures
and
habits
which
aided
them
in
finding
their
bearings
in
the
political
situation
to
the
extent
of
scientifically
falsifying
the
meaning
of
the
current
class
struggle
and
securing
the
hegemony
of
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
in
the
highest
degree
possible
under
the
given
circumstances
this
is
why
the
mensheviks
direct
pleaders
for
the
bourgeoisie
right
to
power
exhausted
themselves
so
rapidly
and
by
the
time
of
the
october
revolution
were
almost
completely
played
out
the
too
were
losing
influence
more
and
more
first
among
the
workingmen
then
in
the
army
and
finally
in
the
villages
but
toward
the
time
of
the
october
upheaval
they
remained
still
a
very
powerful
party
numerically
however
class
contradictions
were
undermining
them
from
within
in
opposition
to
the
right
wing
which
in
its
most
chauvinistic
elements
such
as
avksentyef
savinkoff
had
finally
gone
over
into
the
camp
a
left
wing
was
forming
which
strove
to
preserve
its
connection
with
the
toiling
masses
if
we
merely
recall
the
fact
that
the
avksentyef
as
minister
of
the
interior
arrested
the
peasant
land
committees
composed
of
for
their
arbitrary
solution
of
the
agrarian
question
the
amplitude
of
differences
within
this
party
will
become
sufficiently
clear
to
us
in
its
center
stood
the
party
traditional
leader
chernoff
a
writer
of
experience
in
socialist
literature
an
experienced
hand
in
factional
strife
he
had
constantly
remained
at
the
head
of
the
party
when
party
life
was
being
built
up
in
emigrant
circles
abroad
the
revolution
which
had
raised
the
party
to
an
enormous
height
with
its
first
indiscriminating
wave
automatically
raised
chernoff
too
only
to
reveal
his
complete
impotence
even
as
compared
with
the
other
leading
political
lights
of
the
first
period
the
paltry
resources
which
had
secured
to
chernoff
a
preponderance
in
the
populist
circles
abroad
proved
too
light
in
the
scales
of
the
revolution
he
concentrated
his
efforts
on
not
taking
any
responsible
decisions
evading
in
all
critical
cases
waiting
and
abstaining
for
some
little
time
tactics
of
this
kind
secured
for
him
the
position
as
center
between
the
ever
more
diverging
flanks
but
there
was
no
longer
any
possibility
of
preserving
party
unity
for
long
the
former
terrorist
savinkof
took
part
in
korniloff
conspiracy
was
in
touching
unanimity
with
the
circles
of
cossack
officers
and
was
preparing
an
onslaught
on
petrograd
workingmen
and
soldiers
among
whom
there
were
quite
a
few
left
as
a
sacrifice
to
the
left
wing
the
center
expelled
savinkof
from
the
party
but
hesitated
to
raise
a
hand
against
kerensky
in
the
the
party
showed
signs
of
extreme
disruption
three
groups
existed
independently
though
under
the
banner
of
one
and
the
same
party
but
none
of
the
groups
knew
exactly
what
it
wanted
the
formal
domination
of
this
party
in
the
constituent
assembly
would
have
meant
only
a
continuation
of
political
prostration
withdrawing
from
the
the
voice
of
the
front
before
withdrawing
from
the
membership
in
the
where
according
to
kerensky
and
tseretelli
political
statistics
we
were
entitled
to
some
half
a
hundred
seats
we
arranged
a
conference
with
the
left
group
they
refused
to
follow
us
claiming
that
they
still
had
to
demonstrate
practically
before
the
peasantry
the
insolvency
of
the
said
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
left
we
deem
it
necessary
to
warn
you
that
if
you
want
to
withdraw
from
the
in
order
forthwith
to
go
into
the
streets
for
an
open
fight
we
shall
not
follow
you
the
press
accused
us
of
striving
to
kill
prematurely
the
for
the
very
purpose
of
creating
a
revolutionary
situation
at
our
faction
meeting
in
the
it
was
decided
to
act
independently
and
not
wait
for
the
left
our
declaration
proclaimed
from
the
rostrum
and
explaining
why
we
were
breaking
with
this
institution
was
greeted
with
a
howl
of
hatred
and
impotence
on
the
part
of
the
majority
groups
in
the
petrograd
soviet
of
deputies
where
our
withdrawal
from
the
was
approved
by
an
overwhelming
majority
the
leader
of
the
tiny
internationalist
menshevik
group
martof
explained
to
us
that
the
withdrawal
from
the
temporary
soviet
of
the
republic
such
was
the
official
appellation
of
this
institution
would
be
sensible
only
in
case
we
proposed
immediately
to
assume
an
open
offensive
but
the
point
is
that
this
is
just
what
we
intended
the
prosecutors
for
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
were
right
when
accusing
us
of
striving
to
create
a
revolutionary
situation
in
open
insurrection
and
direct
seizure
of
power
we
beheld
the
only
way
out
of
the
situation
again
as
in
the
july
days
the
press
and
all
the
other
organs
of
public
opinion
were
mobilized
against
us
from
the
july
arsenals
were
dragged
forth
the
most
envenomed
weapons
which
had
been
temporarily
stored
away
there
after
the
korniloff
days
vain
efforts
the
mass
was
irresistibly
moving
toward
us
and
its
spirit
was
rising
hour
by
hour
from
the
trenches
delegates
kept
arriving
how
long
said
they
at
the
petrograd
soviet
meetings
will
this
impossible
situation
last
the
soldiers
have
told
us
to
declare
to
you
if
no
decisive
steps
for
peace
are
made
by
november
the
trenches
will
be
deserted
the
entire
army
will
rush
to
the
rear
this
determination
was
really
spreading
at
the
front
there
the
soldiers
were
passing
on
from
one
unit
to
another
proclamations
summoning
them
not
to
remain
in
the
trenches
later
than
the
first
snowfall
you
have
forgotten
about
us
the
delegates
on
foot
from
the
trenches
exclaimed
at
the
soviet
meetings
if
you
find
no
way
out
of
the
situation
we
shall
come
here
ourselves
and
with
our
bayonets
we
shall
disperse
our
enemies
including
you
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
the
petrograd
council
had
become
the
center
of
attraction
for
the
whole
army
after
its
leading
tendency
had
been
changed
and
new
presiding
officers
elected
its
resolutions
inspired
the
exhausted
and
despondent
troops
at
the
front
with
the
hope
that
the
way
out
of
the
situation
could
be
practically
found
in
the
manner
proposed
by
the
bolsheviks
by
publishing
the
secret
treaties
and
proposing
an
immediate
truce
on
all
fronts
you
say
that
power
must
pass
into
the
hands
of
the
soviets
grasp
it
then
yon
fear
that
the
front
will
not
support
you
cast
all
misgivings
aside
the
soldier
masses
are
with
you
in
overwhelming
majority
meanwhile
the
conflict
regarding
the
transfer
of
the
garrison
kept
on
developing
almost
daily
a
garrison
conference
met
consisting
of
committees
from
the
companies
regiments
and
commands
the
influence
of
our
party
in
the
garrison
was
established
definitely
and
indestructibly
the
petrograd
district
staff
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
perplexity
now
it
would
attempt
to
enter
into
regular
relations
with
us
then
again
egged
on
by
the
leaders
of
the
central
executive
committee
it
would
threaten
us
with
repressive
measures
above
mention
has
already
been
made
of
organizing
at
the
petrograd
soviet
a
military
revolutionary
committee
which
was
intended
to
be
in
fact
the
soviet
staff
of
the
petrograd
garrison
in
opposition
to
kerensky
staff
but
the
existence
of
two
staffs
is
inadmissible
the
representatives
of
the
fusionist
parties
dogmatically
admonished
us
but
is
a
situation
admissible
wherein
the
garrison
mistrusts
the
official
staff
and
fears
that
the
transfer
of
soldiers
from
petrograd
has
been
dictated
by
a
new
machination
we
retorted
the
creation
of
a
second
staff
means
insurrection
came
the
reply
from
the
right
your
military
revolutionary
committee
task
will
not
be
so
much
to
verify
the
operative
projects
and
orders
of
the
military
authorities
as
the
preparation
and
execution
of
an
insurrection
against
the
present
government
this
objection
was
just
but
for
that
very
reason
it
did
not
frighten
anybody
an
overwhelming
majority
of
the
soviet
was
aware
of
the
necessity
of
overthrowing
the
coalition
power
the
more
circumstantially
the
mensheviks
and
demonstrated
that
the
military
revolutionary
committee
would
inevitably
turn
into
an
organ
of
insurrection
the
greater
the
eagerness
with
which
the
petrograd
soviet
supported
the
new
fighting
organization
the
military
revolutionary
committee
first
act
was
to
appoint
commissioners
to
all
parts
of
the
petrograd
garrison
and
all
the
most
important
institutions
of
the
capital
and
environs
from
various
quarters
we
were
receiving
communications
that
the
government
or
more
correctly
the
government
parties
were
actively
organizing
and
arming
their
forces
from
various
and
revolvers
machine
guns
and
cartridges
were
being
brought
forth
for
arming
cadets
students
and
bourgeois
youths
in
general
it
was
necessary
to
take
immediate
preventive
measures
commissioners
were
appointed
to
all
and
stores
almost
without
opposition
they
became
masters
of
the
situation
to
be
sure
the
commandants
and
proprietors
of
the
depots
tried
not
to
recognize
them
but
a
mere
application
to
the
soldiers
committee
or
the
employees
of
each
institution
sufficed
to
cause
the
immediate
breakdown
of
the
opposition
after
that
arms
were
issued
only
on
order
of
our
commissioners
even
prior
to
that
regiments
of
the
petrograd
garrison
had
their
commissioners
but
these
had
been
appointed
by
the
central
executive
committee
above
we
said
that
after
the
june
congress
of
soviets
and
particularly
after
the
june
demonstration
which
revealed
the
ever
growing
power
of
the
bolsheviks
the
fusionist
parties
had
almost
entirely
deprived
the
petrograd
soviet
of
any
practical
influence
on
the
course
of
events
in
the
revolutionary
capital
the
leadership
of
the
petrograd
garrison
was
concentrated
in
the
hands
of
the
central
executive
committee
now
the
task
everywhere
was
to
put
in
the
petrograd
soviet
commissioners
this
was
achieved
with
the
most
energetic
cooperation
of
the
soldier
masses
meetings
addressed
by
speakers
of
various
parties
had
the
result
invariably
that
regiment
after
regiment
declared
it
would
recognize
only
the
petrograd
commissioners
and
would
not
budge
a
step
without
its
decision
an
important
role
in
appointing
these
commissioners
was
played
by
the
bolsheviks
military
organization
before
the
july
days
it
had
developed
a
widespread
agitational
activity
on
july
a
battalion
of
cyclists
brought
by
kerensky
to
petrograd
battered
down
the
isolated
kshessinsky
mansion
where
our
party
military
organization
was
quartered
the
majority
of
leaders
and
many
privates
among
the
members
were
arrested
the
publications
were
stopped
the
printing
shop
was
wrecked
only
by
degrees
did
the
organization
begin
to
repair
its
machinery
afresh
conspiratively
this
time
numerically
it
comprised
in
its
ranks
but
a
very
insignificant
part
of
the
petrograd
garrison
a
few
hundred
men
all
told
but
there
were
among
them
many
soldiers
and
young
officers
chiefly
ensigns
resolute
and
with
heart
and
soul
devoted
to
the
revolution
who
had
passed
through
kerensky
prisons
in
july
and
august
all
of
them
had
placed
themselves
at
the
military
revolutionary
committee
disposal
and
were
being
assigned
to
the
most
responsible
fighting
posts
however
it
would
not
be
superfluous
to
remark
that
precisely
the
members
of
our
party
military
organization
assumed
in
october
an
attitude
of
extraordinary
caution
and
even
some
skepticism
toward
the
idea
of
an
immediate
insurrection
the
closed
character
of
the
organization
and
its
officially
military
character
involuntarily
inclined
its
leaders
to
underestimate
the
purely
technical
and
organizational
resources
of
the
uprising
and
from
this
point
of
view
we
were
undoubtedly
weak
our
strength
lay
in
the
revolutionary
enthusiasm
of
the
masses
and
their
readiness
to
fight
under
our
banner
parallel
with
the
organizing
activity
a
stormy
agitation
was
being
carried
on
this
was
the
period
of
incessant
meetings
at
works
in
the
modern
and
chinizelli
circuses
at
clubs
in
barracks
the
atmosphere
at
all
the
meetings
was
charged
with
electricity
each
mention
of
the
insurrection
was
greeted
with
a
storm
of
plaudits
and
shouts
of
delight
the
bourgeois
press
merely
increased
the
state
of
universal
panic
an
order
issued
over
my
signature
to
the
syestroyetsk
munitions
factory
to
issue
five
thousand
rifles
to
the
red
guard
evoked
an
indescribable
panic
in
bourgeois
circles
the
general
massacre
in
course
of
preparation
was
talked
and
written
about
everywhere
of
course
this
did
not
in
the
least
prevent
the
workingmen
of
the
syestroyetsk
munitions
factory
from
handing
the
arms
over
to
the
red
guards
the
more
frantically
the
bourgeois
press
slandered
and
baited
us
the
more
ardently
the
masses
responded
to
our
call
it
was
growing
clearer
and
clearer
for
both
sides
that
the
crisis
must
break
within
the
next
few
days
the
press
of
the
and
mensheviks
was
sounding
an
alarm
the
revolution
is
in
the
greatest
danger
a
repetition
of
the
july
days
is
being
prepared
but
on
a
much
wider
basis
and
therefore
still
more
destructive
in
its
consequences
in
his
novaya
zhizn
gorki
daily
prophesied
the
approaching
wreck
of
all
civilization
in
general
the
socialistic
veneer
of
the
bourgeois
intellectuals
was
wearing
off
at
the
approach
of
the
stern
domination
of
the
dictatorship
but
on
the
other
hand
the
soldiers
of
even
the
most
backward
regiments
hailed
with
delight
the
military
revolutionary
committee
commissioners
delegates
came
to
us
from
cossack
units
and
from
the
socialist
minority
of
military
cadets
they
promised
at
least
to
assure
the
neutrality
of
their
units
in
case
of
open
conflict
manifestly
kerensky
government
was
losing
its
foundations
the
district
staff
began
negotiations
with
us
and
proposed
a
compromise
in
order
to
size
up
the
enemy
full
resistance
we
entered
into
pourparlers
but
the
staff
was
nervous
now
they
exhorted
then
threatened
us
they
even
declared
our
commissioners
to
be
without
power
which
however
did
not
in
the
least
affect
their
work
in
accord
with
the
staff
the
central
executive
committee
appointed
captain
of
staff
malefski
to
be
chief
commissioner
for
the
petrograd
military
district
and
magnanimously
consented
to
recognize
our
commissioners
on
condition
of
their
being
subordinate
to
the
chief
commissioner
the
proposal
was
rejected
and
the
negotiations
broken
off
prominent
mensheviks
and
came
to
us
as
intermediaries
exhorted
threatened
and
foretold
our
doom
and
the
doom
of
the
revolution
the
petrograd
soviet
day
at
this
period
the
smolny
building
was
already
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
petrograd
soviet
and
of
our
party
the
mensheviks
and
the
transferred
their
political
activity
to
the
maryiinsky
palace
where
the
infant
was
already
expiring
in
the
kerensky
delivered
a
great
speech
in
which
stormily
applauded
by
the
bourgeois
wing
he
endeavored
to
conceal
his
impotence
behind
clamorous
threats
the
staff
made
its
last
attempt
at
opposition
to
all
units
of
the
garrison
it
sent
out
invitations
to
appoint
two
delegates
to
conferences
concerning
the
removal
of
troops
from
the
capital
the
first
conference
was
called
for
october
at
from
the
regiments
we
immediately
received
information
about
it
by
telephone
we
issued
a
call
for
a
garrison
conference
at
withal
a
part
of
the
delegates
did
get
to
the
staff
quarters
only
to
declare
that
without
the
petrograd
soviet
decision
they
would
not
move
anywhere
almost
unanimously
the
garrison
conference
confirmed
its
allegiance
to
the
military
revolutionary
committee
objections
came
only
from
official
representatives
of
the
former
soviet
parties
but
they
found
no
response
whatever
among
the
regimental
delegates
the
staff
attempt
brought
out
only
more
strikingly
that
we
were
standing
on
firm
ground
in
the
front
rank
there
was
the
volhynian
regiment
the
very
one
which
on
july
with
its
band
playing
had
invaded
the
palace
in
order
to
put
down
the
bolsheviks
as
already
mentioned
earlier
the
central
executive
committee
had
charge
of
the
petrograd
soviet
treasury
and
its
publications
an
attempt
to
obtain
even
a
single
one
of
these
publications
brought
no
results
beginning
with
the
end
of
september
we
initiated
a
series
of
measures
toward
creating
an
independent
newspaper
of
the
petrograd
soviet
but
all
printing
establishments
were
occupied
and
their
owners
boycotted
us
with
the
assistance
of
the
central
executive
committee
it
was
decided
to
arrange
for
a
petrograd
soviet
day
for
the
purpose
of
developing
a
widespread
agitation
and
collecting
pecuniary
resources
for
establishing
a
newspaper
about
a
fortnight
before
this
day
was
set
for
october
and
consequently
it
coincided
with
the
moment
of
the
open
outburst
of
the
insurrection
with
complete
assurance
the
hostile
press
announced
that
on
october
an
armed
insurrection
of
the
bolsheviks
would
occur
in
the
streets
of
petrograd
that
the
insurrection
would
occur
nobody
had
any
doubt
they
only
tried
to
determine
exactly
when
they
guessed
they
prophesied
striving
in
this
way
to
force
a
denial
or
confession
on
our
part
but
the
soviet
calmly
and
confidently
marched
forward
making
no
answer
to
the
howl
of
bourgeois
public
opinion
october
became
the
reviewing
day
for
the
forces
of
the
proletarian
army
it
went
off
magnificently
in
every
respect
in
spite
of
the
warnings
coming
from
the
right
that
blood
would
flow
in
torrents
in
the
streets
of
petrograd
the
masses
of
the
populace
were
pouring
in
floods
to
the
petrograd
soviet
meetings
all
our
oratorical
forces
were
mobilized
all
public
places
were
filled
meetings
were
held
unceasingly
for
hours
at
a
stretch
they
were
addressed
by
speakers
of
our
party
by
delegates
arriving
for
the
soviet
congress
by
representatives
from
the
front
by
left
and
by
anarchists
public
buildings
were
flooded
by
waves
of
soldiers
and
sailors
there
had
not
been
many
gatherings
like
that
even
in
the
time
of
the
revolution
up
rose
a
considerable
mass
of
the
petty
townfolk
less
frightened
than
aroused
by
the
shouts
warnings
and
baiting
of
the
bourgeois
press
waves
of
people
by
tens
of
thousands
dashed
against
the
people
house
building
rolled
through
the
corridors
filled
the
halls
on
the
iron
columns
huge
garlands
of
human
heads
feet
and
hands
were
hanging
like
bunches
of
grapes
the
air
was
surcharged
with
the
electric
tension
that
heralds
the
most
critical
moments
of
revolution
down
with
kerensky
government
down
with
the
war
all
power
to
the
soviets
not
one
from
the
ranks
of
the
previous
soviet
parties
ventured
to
appear
before
those
colossal
throngs
with
a
word
of
reply
the
petrograd
soviet
held
undivided
sway
in
reality
the
campaign
had
already
been
won
it
only
remained
to
deal
the
last
military
blow
to
this
spectral
authority
the
most
cautious
in
our
midst
were
reporting
that
there
still
remained
units
that
were
not
with
us
the
cossacks
the
cavalry
regiment
the
semyonofski
regiment
the
cyclists
commissioners
and
agitators
were
assigned
to
these
units
their
reports
sounded
perfectly
satisfactory
the
atmosphere
was
infecting
one
and
all
and
the
most
conservative
elements
of
the
army
were
losing
the
strength
to
withstand
the
general
tendency
of
the
petrograd
garrison
in
the
semyonofski
regiment
which
was
considered
the
bulwark
of
kerensky
government
i
was
present
at
a
meeting
which
took
place
in
the
open
air
the
most
prominent
speakers
of
the
right
wing
addressed
it
they
clung
to
the
conservative
guard
regiments
as
to
the
last
support
of
the
coalition
power
nothing
would
avail
by
an
overwhelming
majority
of
votes
the
regiment
expressed
itself
for
us
and
did
not
even
give
the
a
chance
to
finish
their
speeches
the
groups
which
still
opposed
the
soviet
were
made
up
mainly
of
officers
volunteers
and
generally
of
bourgeois
intellectuals
and
the
masses
of
peasants
and
workmen
were
with
us
one
and
all
the
demarcation
ran
as
a
distinct
social
line
the
fortress
of
peter
and
paul
is
the
central
military
base
of
petrograd
as
commandant
thereof
we
appointed
a
young
ensign
he
proved
the
best
man
for
the
post
and
within
a
few
hours
he
became
master
of
the
situation
the
lawful
authorities
withdrew
biding
their
time
the
element
regarded
as
unreliable
for
us
were
the
cyclists
who
in
july
had
smashed
our
party
military
organization
in
the
kshessinsky
mansion
and
taken
possession
of
the
mansion
itself
on
the
i
went
to
the
fortress
about
within
the
courtyard
a
meeting
was
being
held
the
speakers
of
the
right
wing
were
cautious
and
evasive
in
the
extreme
painstakingly
avoiding
the
question
of
kerensky
whose
name
inevitably
aroused
shouts
of
protest
and
indignation
even
among
the
soldiers
we
were
listened
to
and
our
advice
vas
followed
about
four
the
cyclists
assembled
nearby
in
the
modern
circus
for
a
battalion
meeting
among
the
speakers
appearing
there
was
paradyelof
he
spoke
with
extreme
caution
the
days
had
been
left
far
behind
when
official
and
speakers
referred
to
the
party
of
the
workers
merely
as
to
a
gang
of
traitors
and
hired
agents
of
the
german
kaiser
the
of
the
staff
accosted
me
with
we
really
ought
to
be
able
to
come
to
some
agreement
but
it
was
already
too
late
the
whole
battalion
with
only
thirty
dissenting
votes
had
voted
for
handing
over
all
power
to
the
soviets
the
beginning
of
the
revolution
the
government
of
kerensky
was
restlessly
looking
for
refuge
now
one
way
now
another
two
new
cyclist
battalions
and
the
zenith
battery
were
called
back
from
the
front
and
an
attempt
was
made
to
call
back
some
companies
of
cavalry
the
cyclists
telegraphed
while
on
the
road
to
the
petrograd
soviet
we
are
led
to
petrograd
without
knowing
the
reasons
request
explanations
we
ordered
them
to
stop
and
send
a
delegation
to
petrograd
their
representatives
arrived
and
declared
at
a
meeting
of
the
soviet
that
the
battalion
was
entirely
with
us
this
was
greeted
by
enthusiastic
cheers
the
battalion
received
orders
to
enter
the
city
immediately
the
number
of
delegates
from
the
front
was
increasing
every
day
they
came
to
get
information
about
the
situation
they
gathered
our
literature
and
went
to
bring
the
message
to
the
front
that
the
petrograd
soviet
was
conducting
a
struggle
for
the
power
of
the
workers
soldiers
and
peasants
the
men
in
the
trenches
will
support
you
they
told
us
all
the
old
army
committees
which
had
not
been
reelected
for
the
last
four
or
five
months
sent
threatening
telegrams
to
us
which
however
made
no
impression
we
knew
that
these
committees
were
no
less
out
of
touch
with
the
rank
and
file
of
the
soldiers
than
the
central
executive
committee
with
the
local
soviets
the
military
revolutionary
committee
appointed
commissaries
to
all
railroad
depots
these
commissaries
kept
a
watchful
eye
upon
all
the
arriving
and
departing
trains
and
especially
upon
the
movements
of
troops
continuous
telephone
and
motor
car
communication
was
established
with
the
neighboring
cities
and
their
garrisons
the
soviets
of
all
the
communities
near
petrograd
were
charged
with
the
duty
of
vigilantly
preventing
any
troops
or
rather
troops
misled
by
the
government
from
entering
the
capital
the
railroad
officials
of
lower
rank
and
the
workmen
recognized
our
commissaries
immediately
difficulties
arose
on
the
at
the
telephone
station
they
stopped
connecting
us
the
cadets
took
possession
of
the
station
and
under
their
protection
the
telephone
operators
began
to
oppose
the
soviet
this
was
the
first
appearance
of
the
future
sabotage
the
military
revolutionary
committee
sent
a
detachment
to
the
telephone
station
and
placed
two
small
cannons
there
in
this
way
the
seizing
of
all
departments
of
the
government
and
instruments
of
administration
was
started
the
sailors
and
red
guards
occupied
the
telegraph
station
the
post
office
and
other
institutions
measures
were
taken
to
take
possession
of
the
state
bank
the
center
of
the
government
the
institute
of
smolny
was
turned
into
a
fortress
there
were
in
the
garret
as
a
heritage
of
the
old
central
executive
committee
a
score
of
machine
guns
but
they
were
in
poor
condition
and
had
been
entirely
neglected
by
the
caretakers
we
ordered
an
additional
machine
gun
company
to
the
smolny
institute
early
in
the
morning
the
sailors

over
the

of
the
long
and
corridors
of
the
building
out
of
the
doors
the
frightened
faces
of
the

were
looking
and
wondering
the

held
daily
meetings
in

so
did
the

the
third
floor
of
the

in
a
small
corner

the

socialist

many
brought
pure
nonsense
others
gave
serious
and
valuable
information
the
decisive
moment
drew
near
it
was
apparent
that
there
was
no
going
back
on
the
evening
of
the
of
october
kerensky
appeared
in
the
preliminary
parliament
and
demanded
approval
of
repressive
measures
against
the
bolsheviki
the
preliminary
parliament
however
was
in
a
sad
state
of
indetermination
and
complete
disintegration
the
constitutional
democrats
tried
to
persuade
the
right
to
adopt
a
vote
of
confidence
the
right
exercised
pressure
upon
the
center
the
center
hesitated
the
left
wing
conducted
a
policy
of
parliamentary
opposition
after
many
conferences
debates
hesitations
the
resolution
of
the
left
wing
was
adopted
this
resolution
condemned
the
rebellious
movement
of
the
soviet
but
the
responsibilities
for
the
movement
were
laid
at
the
door
of
the
policy
of
the
government
the
mail
brought
scores
of
letters
daily
informing
us
of
death
sentences
pronounced
against
us
of
infernal
machines
of
the
expected
blowing
up
of

the
bourgeois
press
howled

by
hatred
and
terror
gorki
who
had
forgotten
all
about
the
song
of
the
falcon
continued
to
prophesy
in
his
novaya
zhizn
the
approach
of
the
end
of
the
world
the
members
of
the
military
revolutionary
committee
did
not
leave
the
smolny
during
the
entire
week
they
slept
on
sofas
and
only
at
odd
intervals
wakened
by
couriers
scouts
cyclists
telegraph
messengers
and
telephone
calls
the
night
of
the
was
the
most
restless
we
received
a
telephone
communication
from
pavlovsky
that
the
government
had
called
artillery
from
the
peterhof
school
of
ensigns
at
the
winter
palace
kerensky
gathered
the
cadets
and
officers
we
gave
out
orders
over
the
telephone
to
place
on
all
the
roads
leading
to
petrograd
reliable
military
defence
and
to
send
agitators
to
meet
the
military
detachment
called
by
the
government
in
case
persuasion
would
not
help
they
were
instructed
to
use
armed
force
all
the
negotiations
were
held
over
the
telephone
in
the
open
and
therefore
were
accessible
to
the
agents
of
the
government
the
commissaries
informed
us
over
the
telephone
that
on
all
the
roads
leading
to
petrograd
our
friends
were
on
the
alert
a
cadet
detachment
from
oranienbaum
nevertheless
succeeded
in
getting
by
our
military
defence
during
the
night
and
over
the
telephone
we
followed
their
further
movements
the
outer
guard
of
the
smolny
was
strengthened
by
another
company
communications
with
all
the
detachments
of
the
garrison
went
on
continuously
the
companies
on
guard
in
all
the
regiments
were
awake
the
delegates
of
every
detachment
were
day
and
night
at
the
disposal
of
the
military
revolutionary
committee
an
order
was
given
to
suppress
the
agitation
of
the
black
hundred
without
reserve
and
at
the
first
attempts
at
pogroms
on
the
streets
arms
should
be
used
without
mercy
during
this
decisive
night
all
the
most
important
points
of
the
city
passed
into
our
hands
almost
without
any
opposition
without
struggle
and
without
bloodshed
the
state
bank
was
guarded
by
a
government
detachment
and
an
armored
car
the
building
was
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
our
troops
the
armored
car
was
taken
by
an
unexpected
attack
and
the
bank
went
over
into
the
hands
of
the
military
revolutionary
committee
without
a
single
shot
being
fired
there
was
on
the
river
neva
behind
the
plant
the
cruiser
aurora
which
was
under
repair
its
crew
consisted
entirely
of
sailors
devotedly
loyal
to
the
revolution
when
korniloff
at
the
end
of
august
threatened
petrograd
the
sailors
of
the
aurora
were
called
by
the
government
to
guard
the
winter
palace
and
though
even
then
they
already
hated
the
government
of
kerensky
they
realized
that
it
was
their
duty
to
dam
the
wave
of
the
and
they
took
their
post
without
objection
when
the
danger
passed
they
were
sent
back
now
in
the
days
of
the
october
uprising
they
were
too
dangerous
the
aurora
was
ordered
by
the
minister
of
the
navy
to
weigh
anchor
and
to
get
out
of
petrograd
the
crew
informed
us
immediately
of
this
order
we
annulled
it
and
the
cruiser
remained
where
it
was
ready
at
any
moment
to
put
all
its
military
forces
and
means
at
the
disposal
of
the
soviets
the
decisive
day
at
the
dawn
of
the
a
man
and
woman
employed
in
the
printing
office
came
to
smolny
and
informed
us
that
the
government
had
closed
the
official
journal
of
our
body
and
the
new
gazette
of
the
petrograd
soviet
the
printing
office
was
sealed
by
some
agent
of
the
government
the
military
revolutionary
committee
immediately
recalled
the
orders
and
took
both
publications
under
its
protection
enjoining
upon
the
gallant
wolinsky
regiment
the
great
honor
of
securing
the
free
socialist
press
against
attempts
the
printing
after
that
went
on
without
interruption
and
both
publications
appeared
on
time
the
government
was
still
in
session
at
the
winter
palace
but
it
was
no
more
than
its
own
shadow
as
a
political
power
it
no
longer
existed
on
the
of
october
the
winter
palace
was
gradually
surrounded
by
our
troops
from
all
sides
at
one
in
the
afternoon
i
declared
at
the
session
of
the
petrograd
soviet
in
the
name
of
the
military
revolutionary
committee
that
the
government
of
kerensky
had
ceased
to
exist
and
that
forthwith
and
until
the
convention
of
the
soviets
might
decide
otherwise
the
power
was
to
pass
into
the
hands
of
the
military
revolutionary
committee
a
few
days
earlier
lenin
left
finland
and
was
hiding
in
the
outskirts
of
the
city
in
the
workingmen
quarters
on
the
evening
of
the
he
came
secretly
to
the
smolny
according
to
newspaper
information
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
issue
would
be
a
temporary
compromise
between
ourselves
and
the
kerensky
government
the
bourgeois
press
had
so
often
clamored
about
the
approach
of
the
revolution
about
the
demonstration
of
armed
soldiers
on
the
streets
about
pillaging
and
unavoidable
streams
of
blood
that
now
this
press
failed
to
notice
the
revolution
which
was
really
taking
place
and
accepted
the
negotiations
of
the
general
staff
with
us
at
their
face
value
meanwhile
without
any
chaos
without
street
fights
without
firing
or
bloodshed
the
government
institutions
were
occupied
one
after
another
by
severe
and
disciplined
detachments
of
soldiers
sailors
and
red
guards
in
accordance
with
the
exact
telephone
orders
given
from
the
small
room
on
the
third
floor
of
the
smolny
institute
in
the
evening
a
preliminary
session
of
the
second
convention
of
soviets
was
held
in
the
name
of
the
central
executive
committee
dan
presented
a
report
he
presented
an
indictment
of
the
rebellious
usurpers
and
insurgents
and
attempted
to
frighten
the
convention
with
a
vision
of
the
inevitable
failure
of
the
insurrection
which
he
claimed
would
be
suppressed
by
the
forces
from
the
front
his
address
sounded
unconvincing
and
out
of
place
within
the
walls
of
a
hall
where
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
delegates
were
enthusiastically
observing
the
victorious
advance
of
the
petrograd
revolution
by
this
time
the
winter
palace
was
surrounded
but
it
was
not
yet
taken
from
time
to
time
there
were
shots
from
the
windows
upon
the
besiegers
who
were
closing
in
slowly
and
cautiously
from
the
petropavlovsk
fortress
two
or
three
shells
from
cannons
were
directed
at
the
palace
their
thunder
was
heard
at
the
smolny
martof
spoke
with
helpless
indignation
from
the
platform
of
the
convention
about
civil
war
and
especially
about
the
siege
of
the
winter
palace
where
among
the
ministers
there
were
oh
horror
members
of
the
mensheviki
party
the
sailors
who
came
to
bring
information
from
the
around
the
palace
took
the
floor
against
him
they
reminded
the
accusers
of
the
offensive
of
the
of
june
of
the
treacherous
policy
of
the
old
government
of
the
of
the
death
penalty
for
soldiers
of
the
annihilation
of
the
revolutionary
organization
and
wound
up
by
vowing
to
win
or
die
they
also
brought
word
of
the
first
victims
from
our
ranks
in
the
battle
before
the
palace
all
arose
as
if
at
an
unseen
signal
and
with
a
unanimity
which
could
be
created
only
by
a
high
moral
inspiration
sang
the
funeral
march
he
who
lived
through
that
moment
will
never
forget
it
the
session
was
interrupted
it
was
impossible
to
deliberate
theoretically
the
question
of
the
means
of
reconstructing
the
government
among
the
echoes
of
the
fighting
and
shooting
under
the
walls
of
the
winter
palace
where
the
fate
of
that
very
government
was
being
decided
in
a
practical
way
the
taking
of
the
palace
however
was
rather
slow
and
this
caused
hesitation
among
the
less
determined
elements
of
the
convention
the
orators
of
the
right
wing
prophesied
our
near
destruction
all
anxiously
awaited
news
from
the
arena
of
the
palace
presently
antonoff
appeared
who
directed
the
operations
against
the
palace
a
silence
fell
upon
the
hall
the
winter
palace
was
taken
kerensky
had
fled
other
ministers
had
been
arrested
and
consigned
to
the
fortress
of
petropavlovsk
the
first
chapter
of
the
october
revolution
was
over
the
right
revolutionists
and
the
mensheviki
altogether
sixty
men
that
is
about
of
the
convention
left
the
session
in
protest
as
there
was
nothing
else
left
to
them
they
placed
the
entire
responsibility
for
the
coming
events
upon
the
bolsheviki
and
left
the
latter
were
passing
through
moments
of
indecision
the
past
tied
them
strongly
to
the
party
of
chernoff
the
right
wing
of
this
party
swerved
to
the
middle
and
petty
bourgeois
elements
to
the
intellectuals
of
the
middle
classes
to
the
elements
of
the
villages
and
on
all
decisive
questions
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
against
us
the
more
revolutionary
elements
of
the
party
reflecting
the
radicalism
of
the
social
demands
of
the
poorest
masses
of
the
peasantry
gravitated
to
the
proletariat
and
their
party
they
feared
however
to
sever
the
umbilical
cord
which
linked
them
to
their
old
party
when
we
left
the
preliminary
parliament
they
refused
to
follow
us
and
warned
us
against
adventurers
but
the
insurrection
put
before
them
the
dilemma
of
taking
sides
for
or
against
the
soviets
not
without
hesitation
they
assembled
on
our
side
of
the
barricades
the
formation
of
the
soviet
of
the
people
commissaries
the
victory
in
petrograd
was
complete
the
power
went
over
entirely
to
the
military
revolutionary
committee
we
issued
our
first
decree
abolishing
the
death
penalty
and
ordering
reelections
in
the
army
committees
etc
but
here
we
discovered
that
we
were
cut
off
from
the
provinces
the
higher
authorities
of
the
railroads
post
office
and
telegraph
were
against
us
the
army
committees
the
municipalities
the
zemstvos
continued
to
bombard
the
smolny
with
threatening
telegrams
in
which
they
declared
outright
war
upon
us
and
promised
to
sweep
the
insurgents
out
within
a
short
time
our
telegrams
decrees
and
explanations
did
not
reach
the
provinces
for
the
petrograd
telegraph
agency
refused
to
serve
us
in
this
atmosphere
created
by
the
isolation
of
the
capital
from
the
rest
of
the
country
alarming
and
monstrous
rumors
easily
sprang
up
and
gained
popularity
when
finally
convinced
that
the
soviet
had
really
taken
over
the
powers
of
the
government
that
the
old
government
was
arrested
that
the
streets
of
petrograd
were
dominated
by
armed
workers
the
bourgeois
press
as
well
as
the
press
which
was
for
effecting
a
compromise
started
a
campaign
of
incomparable
madness
indeed
there
was
not
a
lie
or
libel
which
was
not
mobilized
against
the
military
revolutionary
committee
its
leaders
or
its
commissaries
on
the
there
was
a
session
of
the
petrograd
soviet
which
was
attended
by
delegates
from
the
council
members
of
the
garrison
conference
and
numerous
members
of
various
parties
here
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
six
months
spoke
lenin
and
zinoviev
who
were
given
a
stormy
ovation
the
jubilation
over
the
recent
victory
was
marred
somewhat
by
apprehensions
as
to
how
the
country
would
take
to
the
new
revolt
and
as
to
the
soviets
ability
to
retain
control
in
the
evening
an
executive
session
of
the
council
of
soviets
was
held
lenin
introduced
two
decrees
on
peace
and
on
the
land
question
after
brief
discussion
both
decrees
were
adopted
unanimously
it
was
at
this
session
too
that
a
new
central
authority
was
created
to
be
known
as
the
council
of
people
commissaries
the
central
committee
of
our
party
tried
to
win
the
approval
of
the
left
who
were
invited
to
participate
in
establishing
the
soviet
government
they
hesitated
on
the
ground
that
in
their
view
this
government
should
bear
a
coalition
character
within
the
soviet
parties
but
the
mensheviki
and
the
right
broke
entirely
with
the
council
of
soviets
deeming
a
coalition
with
parties
necessary
there
was
nothing
left
for
us
to
do
but
to
let
the
party
of
left
persuade
their
neighbors
to
the
right
to
return
to
the
revolutionary
camp
and
while
they
were
engaged
in
this
hopeless
task
we
thought
it
our
duty
to
take
the
responsibility
for
the
government
entirely
upon
our
party
the
list
of
peoples
commissaries
was
composed
exclusively
of
bolsheviki
there
was
undoubtedly
some
political
danger
in
such
a
course
the
change
proved
too
precipitate
one
need
but
remember
that
the
leaders
of
this
party
were
only
yesterday
still
under
indictment
under
statute
law
no
that
is
accused
of
high
treason
but
there
was
no
other
alternative
the
other
soviet
groups
hesitated
and
evaded
the
issue
preferring
to
adopt
a
waiting
policy
finally
we
became
convinced
that
only
our
party
could
set
up
a
revolutionary
government
the
first
days
of
the
new
regime
the
decrees
on
land
and
peace
approved
by
the
council
were
printed
in
huge
quantities
and
through
delegates
from
the
front
peasant
pedestrians
arriving
from
the
villages
and
agitators
sent
by
us
to
the
trenches
in
the
provinces
were
strewn
broadcast
all
over
the
country
simultaneously
the
work
of
organizing
and
arming
the
red
guards
was
carried
on
together
with
the
old
garrison
and
the
sailors
the
red
guard
was
doing
hard
patrol
duty
the
council
of
people
commissaries
got
control
of
one
government
department
after
another
though
everywhere
encountering
the
passive
resistance
of
the
higher
and
middle
grade
officials
the
former
soviet
parties
tried
their
utmost
to
find
support
in
this
class
and
organize
a
sabotage
of
the
new
government
our
enemies
felt
certain
that
the
whole
affair
was
a
mere
episode
that
in
a
day
or
two
at
most
a
week
the
soviet
government
would
be
overthrown
the
first
foreign
councillors
and
members
of
the
embassies
impelled
quite
as
much
by
curiosity
as
by
necessary
business
on
hand
appeared
at
the
smolny
institute
newspaper
correspondents
hurried
thither
with
their
notebooks
and
cameras
everyone
hastened
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
new
government
being
sure
that
in
a
day
or
two
it
would
be
too
late
perfect
order
reigned
in
the
city
the
sailors
soldiers
and
the
red
guards
bore
themselves
in
these
first
days
with
excellent
discipline
and
nobly
supported
the
regime
of
stern
revolutionary
order
in
the
enemy
camp
fear
arose
lest
the
episode
should
become
too
protracted
and
so
the
first
force
for
attacking
the
new
government
was
being
hastily
organized
in
this
the
initiative
was
taken
by
the
and
the
mensheviki
in
the
preceding
period
they
would
not
and
dared
not
take
all
the
power
into
their
own
hands
in
keeping
with
their
provisional
political
position
they
contented
themselves
with
serving
in
the
coalition
government
in
the
capacity
of
assistants
critics
and
benevolent
accusers
and
defenders
of
the
bourgeoisie
during
all
elections
they
conscientiously
anathematized
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
while
in
the
government
they
just
as
regularly
combined
with
it
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
revolution
they
managed
as
a
result
of
this
policy
to
lose
absolutely
all
the
confidence
of
the
populace
and
army
and
now
the
october
revolt
was
dashing
them
from
the
helm
of
the
state
and
yet
only
yesterday
they
considered
themselves
the
masters
of
the
situation
the
bolshevik
leaders
whom
they
persecuted
were
in
hiding
as
under
czarism
the
bolsheviki
were
in
power
while
yesterday
coalitionist
ministers
and
their
found
themselves
cast
aside
and
suddenly
deprived
of
every
bit
of
influence
upon
the
further
course
of
events
they
would
not
and
could
not
believe
that
this
sudden
revolt
marked
the
beginning
of
a
new
era
they
preferred
to
consider
it
as
merely
accidental
the
result
of
some
misunderstanding
which
could
be
removed
by
a
few
energetic
speeches
and
accusational
newspaper
articles
but
every
hour
they
encountered
more
and
more
insurmountable
obstacles
this
is
what
caused
their
blind
truly
furious
hatred
the
bourgeois
politicians
did
not
venture
to
be
sure
to
get
too
close
to
danger
they
pushed
to
the
front
the
and
mensheviki
who
in
the
attack
upon
us
acquired
all
that
energy
which
they
had
lacked
during
the
period
when
they
were
a
power
their
organs
circulated
the
most
amazing
rumors
and
lies
in
their
name
it
was
that
the
proclamations
containing
open
appeals
to
crush
the
new
government
were
issued
it
was
they
too
who
organized
the
government
officials
for
sabotage
and
the
cadets
for
military
resistance
on
the
and
we
continued
to
receive
persistent
threats
by
telegraph
from
army
committees
town
dumas
vikzhel
zemstvos
and
organizations
which
had
charge
of
the
management
of
the
railroad
union
on
the
nevsky
prospect
the
principal
thoroughfare
of
the
capital
bourgeoisie
things
were
becoming
more
and
more
lively
the
bourgeois
youth
was
emerging
from
its
stupor
and
urged
on
by
the
press
was
developing
a
wider
and
wider
agitation
against
the
soviet
government
with
the
help
of
the
bourgeois
crowd
the
cadets
were
disarming
individual
red
guardsmen
on
the
red
guardsmen
and
sailors
were
being
shot
down
a
group
of
cadets
seized
the
telephone
station
attempts
were
made
by
the
same
side
to
seize
the
telegraph
office
finally
we
learned
that
three
armored
cars
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
some
inimical
military
organization
the
bourgeois
elements
were
clearly
raising
their
heads
the
newspapers
heralded
the
fact
that
we
had
but
a
few
hours
more
to
live
our
friends
intercepted
a
few
secret
orders
which
made
it
clear
however
that
a
militant
organization
had
been
formed
to
fight
the
petrograd
soviet
the
leading
place
in
this
organization
was
taken
by
the
committee
for
the
defence
of
the
revolution
organized
by
the
local
duma
and
the
central
executive
committee
of
the
former
regime
here
and
there
right
and
mensheviki
held
sway
at
the
disposal
of
this
committee
were
the
cadets
students
and
many
army
officers
who
sought
from
under
cover
of
the
coalitions
to
deal
the
soviets
a
mortal
blow
the
cadet
uprising
of
october
the
stronghold
of
the
organization
was
the
cadet
schools
and
the
engineering
castle
where
considerable
arms
and
ammunition
were
stored
and
from
where
attacks
were
made
upon
the
revolutionary
government
headquarters
detachments
of
red
guards
and
sailors
had
surrounded
the
cadet
schools
and
were
sending
in
messengers
demanding
the
surrender
of
all
arms
some
scattering
shots
came
in
reply
the
besiegers
were
trampled
upon
crowds
of
people
gathered
around
them
and
not
infrequently
stray
shots
fired
from
the
windows
would
wound
the
skirmishes
were
assuming
an
indefinitely
prolonged
character
and
this
threatened
the
revolutionary
detachments
with
demoralization
it
was
necessary
therefore
to
adopt
the
most
determined
measures
the
task
of
disarming
the
cadets
was
assigned
to
the
commandant
of
petropavlovsk
fortress
ensign
b
he
closely
surrounded
the
cadet
schools
brought
up
some
armored
cars
and
artillery
and
gave
the
cadets
ten
minutes
time
to
surrender
renewed
firing
from
the
windows
was
the
answer
at
first
at
the
expiration
of
the
ten
minutes
ordered
an
artillery
charge
the
very
first
shots
made
yawning
breaches
in
the
walls
of
the
schoolhouse
the
cadets
surrendered
though
many
of
them
tried
to
save
themselves
by
flight
firing
as
they
fled
considerable
rancor
was
created
such
as
always
accompanies
civil
war
the
sailors
undoubtedly
committed
many
outrages
upon
individual
cadets
the
bourgeois
press
later
accused
the
sailors
and
the
soviet
government
of
inhumanity
and
brutality
it
never
mentioned
however
the
fact
that
the
revolt
of
october
had
been
brought
about
with
hardly
any
firing
or
sacrifice
and
that
only
the
conspiracy
which
was
organized
by
the
bourgeoisie
and
which
threw
the
young
generation
into
the
flame
of
civil
war
against
the
workers
soldiers
and
sailors
led
to
unavoidable
severities
and
sacrifices
the
of
october
marked
a
decided
change
in
the
mood
of
the
inhabitants
of
petrograd
events
took
on
a
more
tragic
character
at
the
same
time
our
enemies
realized
that
the
situation
was
far
more
serious
than
they
thought
at
first
and
that
the
soviet
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
relinquishing
the
power
it
had
won
just
to
oblige
the
junkers
and
the
capitalistic
newspapers
the
work
of
clearing
petrograd
of
centers
was
carried
on
intensively
the
cadets
were
almost
all
disarmed
the
participators
in
the
insurrection
were
arrested
and
either
imprisoned
in
the
petropavlovsk
fortress
or
deported
to
kronstadt
all
publications
which
openly
preached
revolt
against
soviet
authority
were
promptly
suppressed
orders
were
issued
for
the
arrest
of
such
of
the
leaders
of
the
former
soviet
parties
whose
names
figured
on
the
intercepted
edicts
all
military
resistance
in
the
capital
was
crushed
absolutely
next
came
a
long
and
exhausting
struggle
against
the
sabotage
of
the
bureaucrats
technical
workers
clerks
etc
these
elements
which
by
their
earning
capacity
belong
largely
to
the
downtrodden
class
of
society
align
themselves
with
the
bourgeois
class
by
the
conditions
of
their
life
and
by
their
general
psychology
they
had
sincerely
and
faithfully
served
the
government
and
its
institutions
when
it
was
headed
by
czarism
they
continued
to
serve
the
government
when
the
authority
passed
over
into
the
hands
of
the
bourgeois
imperialists
they
were
inherited
with
all
their
knowledge
and
technical
skill
by
the
coalition
government
in
the
next
period
of
the
revolution
but
when
the
revolting
workingmen
soldiers
and
peasants
flung
the
parties
of
the
exploiting
classes
away
from
the
rudder
of
state
and
tried
to
take
the
management
of
affairs
into
their
own
hands
then
the
bureaucrats
and
clerks
flew
into
a
passion
and
absolutely
refused
to
support
the
new
government
in
any
way
more
and
more
extensive
became
this
sabotage
which
was
organized
mostly
by
and
mensheviki
and
which
was
supported
by
funds
furnished
by
the
banks
and
the
allied
embassies
kerensky
advance
on
petrograd
the
stronger
the
soviet
government
became
in
petrograd
the
more
the
bourgeois
groups
placed
their
hopes
on
military
aid
from
without
the
petrograd
telegraph
agency
the
railroad
telegraph
and
the
station
of
brought
from
every
side
news
of
huge
forces
marching
on
petrograd
with
the
object
of
crushing
the
rebels
there
and
establishing
order
kerensky
was
making
flying
trips
to
the
front
and
the
bourgeois
papers
reported
that
he
was
leading
innumerable
forces
against
the
bolsheviki
we
found
ourselves
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
country
as
the
telegraphers
refused
to
serve
us
but
the
soldiers
who
arrived
by
tens
and
hundreds
on
commissions
from
their
respective
regiments
invariably
said
to
us
have
no
fears
of
the
front
it
is
entirely
on
your
side
you
need
but
give
the
word
and
we
will
send
to
your
aid
even
this
very
day
a
division
or
a
corps
it
was
the
same
in
the
army
as
everywhere
else
the
masses
were
for
us
and
the
upper
classes
against
us
in
the
hands
of
the
latter
was
the
machinery
various
parts
of
the
vast
army
proved
to
be
isolated
one
from
another
we
were
isolated
from
both
the
army
and
the
people
nevertheless
the
news
of
the
soviet
government
at
petrograd
and
its
decrees
spread
throughout
the
country
and
roused
the
local
soviets
to
rebel
against
the
old
government
the
reports
of
kerensky
advance
on
petrograd
at
the
head
of
some
forces
or
other
soon
became
more
persistent
and
assumed
more
definite
outlines
we
were
informed
from
that
cossack
echelons
were
not
far
from
there
while
an
appeal
signed
by
kerensky
and
general
krassnov
was
being
circulated
in
petrograd
calling
upon
the
whole
garrison
to
join
the
government
forces
which
were
expected
any
hour
to
enter
the
capital
the
cadet
insurrection
of
october
was
undoubtedly
connected
with
kerensky
undertaking
only
that
it
broke
out
too
soon
owing
to
determined
action
on
our
part
the
garrison
was
ordered
to
demand
of
the
approaching
cossack
regiments
recognition
of
the
soviet
government
in
case
of
refusal
the
cossacks
were
to
be
disarmed
but
that
garrison
proved
to
be
for
military
operations
it
had
no
artillery
and
no
leaders
its
officers
being
unfriendly
toward
the
soviet
government
the
cossacks
took
possession
of
the
station
at
the
most
powerful
one
in
the
country
and
marched
on
the
garrisons
of
peterhof
and
gatchina
displayed
neither
initiative
nor
resolution
after
the
almost
bloodless
victory
at
petrograd
the
soldiers
confidently
assumed
that
matters
would
take
a
similar
course
in
the
future
all
that
was
necessary
they
thought
was
to
send
an
agitator
to
the
cossacks
who
would
lay
down
their
arms
the
moment
the
object
of
the
proletarian
revolution
was
explained
to
them
uprising
was
put
down
by
means
of
speeches
and
fraternization
by
agitation
and
seizure
of
certain
institutions
without
a
fight
the
kerensky
government
was
overthrown
the
same
methods
were
now
being
employed
by
the
leaders
of
the
and
the
gatchina
soviets
with
general
krassnov
cossacks
but
this
time
they
did
not
work
though
without
determination
or
enthusiasm
the
cossacks
did
advance
individual
detachments
approached
gatchina
and
engaged
the
scanty
forces
of
the
local
garrisons
and
sometimes
disarmed
them
about
the
numerical
strength
of
kerensky
forces
we
at
first
had
no
idea
whatever
some
said
that
general
krassnov
headed
ten
thousand
men
others
affirmed
that
he
had
no
more
than
a
thousand
while
the
unfriendly
newspapers
and
circulars
announced
in
letters
an
inch
big
that
two
corps
were
lined
up
beyond
there
was
a
general
want
of
confidence
in
the
petrograd
garrison
no
sooner
had
it
won
a
bloodless
victory
than
it
was
called
upon
to
march
out
against
an
enemy
of
unknown
numbers
and
engage
in
battles
of
uncertain
outcome
in
the
garrison
conference
the
discussion
centered
about
the
necessity
of
sending
out
more
and
more
agitators
and
of
issuing
appeals
to
the
cossacks
for
to
the
soldiers
it
seemed
impossible
that
the
cossacks
would
refuse
to
rise
to
the
point
of
view
which
the
petrograd
garrison
was
defending
in
its
struggle
nevertheless
advanced
groups
of
cossacks
approached
quite
close
to
petrograd
and
we
anticipated
that
the
principal
battle
would
take
place
in
the
streets
of
the
city
the
greatest
resolution
was
shown
by
the
red
guards
they
demanded
arms
ammunition
and
leadership
but
everything
in
the
military
machine
was
disorganized
and
out
of
gear
owing
partly
to
disuse
and
partly
to
evil
intent
the
officers
had
resigned
many
had
fled
the
rifles
were
in
one
place
and
the
cartridges
in
another
matters
were
still
worse
with
artillery
the
cannons
gun
carriages
and
the
military
stores
were
all
in
different
places
and
all
these
had
to
be
groped
for
in
the
dark
the
various
regiments
did
not
have
at
their
disposal
either
sappers
tools
or
field
telephones
the
revolutionary
general
staff
which
tried
to
straighten
out
things
from
above
encountered
insurmountable
obstacles
the
greatest
of
which
was
the
sabotage
of
the
employees
then
we
decided
to
appeal
directly
to
the
working
class
we
stated
that
the
success
of
the
revolution
was
most
seriously
threatened
and
that
it
was
for
them
by
their
energy
initiative
and
to
save
and
strengthen
the
regime
of
proletarian
and
peasant
government
this
appeal
met
with
tremendous
practical
success
almost
immediately
thousands
of
workingmen
proceeded
toward
kerensky
forces
and
began
digging
trenches
the
munition
workers
manned
the
cannon
themselves
obtaining
ammunition
for
them
from
various
stores
requisitioned
horses
brought
the
guns
into
the
necessary
positions
and
adjusted
them
organized
a
commissary
department
procured
gasoline
motors
automobiles
requisitioned
provisions
and
forage
and
put
the
sanitary
trains
on
a
proper
footing
created
in
short
the
entire
war
machinery
which
we
had
vainly
endeavored
to
create
from
above
when
scores
of
heavy
guns
reached
the
lines
the
disposition
of
our
soldiers
changed
immediately
under
cover
of
the
artillery
they
were
ready
to
repulse
the
cossacks
attack
in
the
first
lines
were
the
sailors
and
red
guards
a
few
officers
politically
unrelated
to
us
but
sincerely
attached
to
their
regiments
accompanied
their
soldiers
to
the
lines
and
directed
their
operations
against
krassnov
cossacks
collapse
of
kerensky
attempt
meanwhile
telegrams
spread
the
report
all
over
the
country
and
abroad
that
the
bolshevik
adventure
had
been
disposed
of
and
that
kerensky
had
entered
petrograd
and
was
establishing
order
with
an
iron
hand
on
the
other
hand
in
petrograd
itself
the
bourgeois
press
emboldened
by
the
proximity
of
kerensky
troops
wrote
about
the
complete
demoralization
of
the
petrograd
garrison
about
an
irresistible
advance
of
the
cossacks
equipped
with
much
artillery
and
predicted
the
imminent
fall
of
the
smolny
institute
our
chief
handicap
was
as
already
stated
the
lack
of
suitable
mechanical
accessories
and
of
men
able
to
direct
military
operations
even
those
officers
who
had
conscientiously
accompanied
their
soldiers
to
the
lines
declined
the
position
of
after
long
deliberation
we
hit
upon
the
following
combination
the
garrison
council
selected
a
committee
of
five
persons
which
was
entrusted
with
the
supreme
control
of
all
operations
against
the
forces
moving
on
petrograd
this
committee
subsequently
reached
an
understanding
with
colonel
muravief
who
was
in
the
opposition
party
under
the
kerensky
regime
and
who
now
on
his
own
initiative
offered
his
services
to
the
soviet
government
on
the
cold
night
of
october
muravief
and
i
started
by
automobile
for
the
lines
wagons
with
provisions
forage
military
supplies
and
artillery
trailed
along
the
road
all
this
was
done
by
the
workingmen
of
various
factories
several
times
our
automobile
was
stopped
on
the
way
by
red
guard
patrols
who
verified
our
permit
since
the
first
days
of
the
october
revolution
every
automobile
in
town
had
been
requisitioned
and
no
automobile
could
be
ridden
through
the
streets
of
the
city
or
in
the
outskirts
of
the
capital
without
a
permit
from
the
smolny
institute
the
vigilance
of
the
red
guards
was
beyond
all
praise
they
stood
on
watch
about
small
camp
fires
rifle
in
hand
hours
at
a
time
the
sight
of
these
young
armed
workmen
by
the
camp
fires
in
the
snow
was
the
best
symbol
of
the
proletarian
revolution
many
guns
had
been
drawn
up
in
position
and
there
was
no
lack
of
ammunition
the
decisive
encounter
developed
on
this
very
day
between
and
after
a
fierce
artillery
duel
the
cossacks
who
kept
on
advancing
as
long
as
they
met
no
obstacles
hastily
withdrew
they
had
been
fooled
all
the
time
by
tales
of
harsh
and
cruel
acts
committed
by
the
bolsheviki
who
wished
as
it
were
to
sell
russia
to
the
german
kaiser
they
had
been
assured
that
almost
the
entire
garrison
at
petrograd
was
impatiently
awaiting
them
as
deliverers
the
first
serious
resistance
completely
disorganized
their
ranks
and
sealed
the
fate
of
kerensky
entire
undertaking
the
retreat
of
krassnov
cossacks
enabled
us
to
get
control
of
the
radio
station
at
we
immediately
wirelessed
the
news
of
our
victory
over
kerensky
forces
our
foreign
friends
informed
us
subsequently
that
the
german
wireless
station
refused
on
orders
from
above
to
receive
this
wireless
message

message
selo
pulkovo
general
staff
the
night
of
october
will
go
down
in
history
kerensky
attempt
to
march
forces
upon
the
capital
of
the
revolution
has
received
a
decisive
check
kerensky
is
retreating
we
are
advancing
the
soldiers
sailors
and
workingmen
of
petrograd
have
shown
that
they
can
and
will
gun
in
hand
affirm
the
will
and
power
of
proletarian
democracy
the
bourgeoisie
tried
to
isolate
the
army
of
the
revolution
and
kerensky
attempted
to
crush
it
by
cossackism
both
have
been
frustrated
the
great
idea
of
the
reign
of
a
workingmen
and
peasants
democracy
united
the
ranks
of
the
army
and
hardened
its
will
the
whole
country
will
now
come
to
understand
that
the
soviet
government
is
not
a
passing
phenomenon
but
a
permanent
fact
of
the
supremacy
of
the
workers
soldiers
and
peasants
kerensky
repulse
was
the
repulse
of
the
middle
class
the
bourgeoisie
and
the
kornilovites
kerensky
repulse
means
the
affirmation
of
the
people
rights
to
a
free
peaceful
life
to
land
food
and
power
the
pulkovsky
division
by
their
brilliant
charge
is
strengthening
the
cause
of
the
proletarian
and
peasant
revolution
there
can
be
no
return
to
the
past
there
is
still
fighting
obstacles
and
sacrifice
ahead
of
us
but
the
way
is
open
and
victory
assured
revolutionary
russia
and
the
soviet
government
may
well
be
proud
of
their
pulkovsky
division
commanded
by
colonel
walden
may
the
names
of
the
fallen
never
be
forgotten
all
honor
to
the
fighters
for
the
revolution
the
soldiers
and
the
officers
who
stood
by
the
people
long
live
revolutionary
and
socialist
russia
in
the
name
of
the
council
of
people
commissaries
trotzky
the
first
reaction
of
the
german
authorities
to
the
events
of
october
was
thus
one
of
fear
fear
lest
these
events
provoke
disturbances
in
germany
itself
in
part
of
our
telegram
was
accepted
and
so
far
as
we
can
tell
has
been
the
source
of
information
for
all
europe
upon
the
attempt
of
kerensky
to
recover
his
power
and
its
miserable
failure
discontent
was
rife
among
krassnov
cossacks
they
began
sending
their
scouts
into
petrograd
and
even
official
delegates
to
smolny
there
they
had
the
opportunity
to
convince
themselves
that
perfect
order
reigned
in
the
capital
thanks
to
the
petrograd
garrison
which
unanimously
supported
the
soviet
government
the
cossacks
disorganization
became
the
more
acute
as
the
absurdity
of
the
plan
to
take
petrograd
with
some
thousand
horsemen
dawned
upon
them
for
the
supports
promised
them
from
the
front
never
arrived
krassnov
detachment
withdrew
to
gatchinsk
and
when
we
started
out
thither
the
next
day
krassnov
staff
were
already
virtually
prisoners
of
the
cossacks
themselves
our
gatchinsk
garrison
was
holding
all
the
most
important
military
positions
the
cossacks
on
the
other
hand
though
not
yet
disarmed
were
absolutely
in
no
position
for
further
resistance
they
wanted
but
one
thing
to
be
allowed
as
soon
as
possible
to
return
to
the
don
region
or
at
least
back
to
the
front
the
gatchinsk
palace
presented
a
curious
sight
at
every
entrance
stood
a
special
guard
while
at
the
gates
were
artillery
and
armored
cars
sailors
soldiers
and
red
guards
occupied
the
royal
apartments
decorated
with
precious
paintings
scattered
upon
the
tables
made
of
expensive
wood
lay
soldiers
clothes
pipes
and
empty
sardine
boxes
in
one
of
the
rooms
general
krassnov
staff
had
established
itself
on
the
floor
lay
mattresses
caps
and
greatcoats
the
representative
of
the
revolutionary
war
committee
who
escorted
us
entered
the
quarters
of
the
general
staff
noisily
dropped
his
to
the
floor
and
resting
upon
it
announced
general
krassnov
you
and
your
staff
are
prisoners
of
the
soviet
authorities
immediately
armed
red
guards
barred
both
doors
kerensky
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
he
had
again
fled
as
he
had
done
before
from
the
winter
palace
as
to
the
circumstances
attending
this
flight
general
krassnov
made
a
written
statement
on
november
i
cite
here
in
full
this
curious
document
november
about
today
i
was
summoned
by
the
supreme
kerensky
he
was
very
agitated
and
nervous
general
said
he
you
have
betrayed
me
your
cossacks
here
positively
say
that
they
will
arrest
me
and
turn
me
over
to
the
sailors
yes
i
answered
there
is
talk
about
it
and
i
know
that
you
have
no
sympathizers
here
at
all
but
are
the
officers
too
of
the
same
mind
yes
the
officers
are
especially
dissatisfied
with
you
then
what
am
i
to
do
i
have
to
commit
suicide
if
you
are
an
honest
man
you
will
proceed
immediately
to
petrograd
under
a
flag
of
truce
and
report
to
the
revolutionary
committee
where
you
will
talk
things
over
as
the
head
of
the
government
yes
i
do
that
general
i
will
furnish
a
guard
for
you
and
will
ask
that
a
sailor
accompany
you
no
anyone
but
a
sailor
do
you
know
that
dybenko
is
here
no
i
do
know
who
dybenko
is
he
is
an
enemy
of
mine
well
that
ca
be
helped
when
one
plays
for
great
stakes
he
must
be
prepared
to
lose
all
all
right
only
i
shall
go
at
night
why
that
would
be
flight
go
calmly
and
openly
so
that
everyone
can
see
that
you
are
fleeing
well
all
right
only
you
must
provide
for
me
a
dependable
convoy
all
right
i
went
and
called
out
a
cossack
from
the
don
cossack
regiment
a
certain
rysskov
and
ordered
him
to
appoint
eight
cossacks
to
guard
the
supreme
half
an
hour
later
the
cossacks
came
and
reported
that
kerensky
had
gone
already
that
he
had
fled
i
gave
an
alarm
and
ordered
a
search
for
him
i
believe
that
he
can
not
have
escaped
from
gatchinsk
and
must
now
be
in
hiding
here
somewhere
commanding
the
corps
krassnov
thus
ended
this
undertaking
our
opponents
still
would
not
yield
however
and
did
not
admit
that
the
question
of
government
power
was
settled
they
continued
to
base
their
hopes
on
the
front
many
leaders
of
the
former
soviet
parties
chernoff
tseretelli
avksentiev
gotz
and
others
went
to
the
front
entered
into
negotiations
with
the
old
army
committees
and
according
to
newspaper
reports
tried
even
in
the
camp
to
form
a
new
ministry
all
this
came
to
naught
the
old
army
committees
had
lost
all
their
significance
and
intensive
work
was
going
on
at
the
front
in
connection
with
the
conferences
and
councils
called
for
the
purpose
of
reorganizing
all
army
organizations
in
these
the
soviet
government
was
everywhere
victorious
from
gatchinsk
our
divisions
proceeded
along
the
railroad
further
in
the
direction
of
the
luga
river
and
pskov
on
the
way
they
met
a
few
more
trainloads
of
and
cossacks
which
had
been
called
out
by
kerensky
or
which
individual
generals
had
sent
over
with
one
of
these
echelons
there
was
even
an
armed
encounter
but
most
of
the
soldiers
that
were
sent
from
the
front
to
petrograd
declared
as
soon
as
they
met
with
representatives
of
the
soviet
forces
that
they
had
been
deceived
and
that
they
would
not
lift
a
finger
against
the
government
of
soldiers
and
workingmen
internal
friction
in
the
meantime
the
struggle
for
soviet
control
spread
all
over
the
country
in
moscow
especially
this
struggle
took
on
an
extremely
protracted
and
bloody
character
perhaps
not
the
least
important
cause
of
this
was
the
fact
that
the
leaders
of
the
revolt
did
not
at
once
show
the
necessary
determination
in
attacking
in
civil
war
more
than
in
any
other
victory
can
be
insured
only
by
a
determined
and
persistent
course
there
must
be
no
vacillation
to
engage
in
parleys
is
dangerous
merely
to
mark
time
is
suicidal
we
are
dealing
here
with
the
masses
who
have
never
held
any
power
in
their
hands
who
are
therefore
most
wanting
in
political
any
hesitation
at
revolutionary
headquarters
demoralizes
them
immediately
it
is
only
when
a
revolutionary
party
steadily
and
resolutely
makes
for
its
goal
that
it
can
help
the
toilers
to
overcome
their
instincts
of
slavery
and
lead
them
on
to
victory
and
only
by
these
means
of
aggressive
charges
can
victory
be
achieved
with
the
smallest
expenditure
of
energy
and
the
least
number
of
sacrifices
but
the
great
difficulty
is
to
acquire
such
firm
and
positive
tactics
the
people
want
of
confidence
in
their
own
power
and
their
lack
of
political
experience
are
naturally
reflected
in
their
leaders
who
in
their
turn
find
themselves
subjected
besides
to
the
tremendous
pressure
of
bourgeois
public
opinion
from
above
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
treated
with
contempt
and
indignation
the
mere
idea
of
the
possibility
of
a
working
class
government
and
gave
free
vent
to
their
feelings
on
the
subject
in
the
innumerable
organs
at
their
disposal
close
behind
them
trailed
the
intellectuals
who
with
all
their
professions
of
radicalism
and
all
the
socialistic
coating
of
their
are
in
the
depths
of
their
hearts
completely
steeped
in
slavish
worship
of
bourgeois
strength
and
administrative
ability
all
these
socialistic
intellectuals
hastily
joined
the
right
and
considered
the
strength
of
the
soviet
government
as
the
clear
beginning
of
the
end
after
the
representatives
of
the
liberal
professions
came
the
petty
officials
the
administrative
technicians
all
those
elements
which
materially
and
spiritually
subsist
on
the
crumbs
that
fall
from
the
bourgeois
table
the
opposition
of
these
elements
was
chiefly
passive
in
character
especially
after
the
crushing
of
the
cadet
insurrection
but
nevertheless
it
might
still
seem
formidable
we
were
being
denied
at
every
step
the
government
officials
would
either
leave
the
ministry
or
refuse
to
work
while
remaining
in
it
they
would
turn
over
neither
the
business
of
the
department
nor
its
money
accounts
the
telephone
operators
refused
to
connect
us
while
our
messages
were
either
held
up
or
distorted
in
the
telegraph
offices
we
could
not
get
translators
stenographers
or
even
copyists
all
this
could
not
fail
to
create
such
an
atmosphere
as
led
various
elements
in
the
higher
ranks
of
our
own
party
to
doubt
whether
in
the
face
of
a
boycott
by
bourgeois
society
the
toilers
could
manage
to
put
the
machinery
of
government
in
working
order
and
continue
in
power
opinions
were
voiced
as
to
the
necessity
of
coalition
coalition
with
whom
with
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
but
an
attempt
at
coalition
with
them
had
driven
the
revolution
into
a
terrible
morass
the
revolt
of
the
of
october
was
an
act
of
on
the
part
of
the
masses
after
the
period
of
impotence
and
treason
of
the
leaders
of
coalition
government
there
remained
for
us
only
coalition
in
the
ranks
of
revolutionary
democracy
that
is
coalition
of
all
the
soviet
parties
such
a
coalition
we
did
in
fact
propose
from
the
very
beginning
at
the
session
of
the
second
council
of
soviets
on
the
of
october
the
kerensky
government
had
been
overthrown
and
we
suggested
that
the
council
of
soviets
take
the
government
into
its
own
hands
but
the
right
parties
withdrew
slamming
the
door
after
them
and
this
was
the
best
thing
they
could
have
done
they
represented
an
insignificant
section
of
the
council
they
no
longer
had
any
following
in
the
masses
and
those
classes
which
still
supported
them
out
of
mere
inertia
were
coming
over
to
our
side
more
and
more
coalition
with
the
right
and
the
mensheviki
could
not
broaden
the
social
basis
of
the
soviet
government
and
would
at
the
same
time
introduce
into
the
composition
of
this
government
elements
which
were
completely
disintegrated
by
political
skepticism
and
idolatry
of
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
the
whole
strength
of
the
new
government
lay
in
the
radicalism
of
its
program
and
the
boldness
of
its
actions
to
tie
itself
up
with
the
chernofi
and
tseretelli
factions
would
mean
to
bind
the
new
government
hand
and
foot
to
deprive
it
of
freedom
of
action
and
thereby
forfeit
the
confidence
of
the
masses
in
the
shortest
possible
time
our
nearest
political
neighbors
to
the
right
were
the
left
social
revolutionists
they
were
in
general
quite
ready
to
support
us
but
endeavored
nevertheless
to
form
a
coalition
socialist
government
the
management
of
the
railroad
union
the
vikzhal
the
central
committee
of
the
postal
telegraph
employees
and
the
union
of
government
officials
were
all
against
us
and
in
the
higher
circles
of
our
own
party
voices
were
being
raised
as
to
the
necessity
of
reaching
an
understanding
with
these
organizations
one
way
or
another
but
on
what
basis
all
the
controlling
organizations
of
the
old
period
had
outlived
their
usefulness
they
bore
approximately
the
same
relation
to
the
entire
lower
personnel
as
did
the
old
army
committees
to
the
masses
of
soldiers
in
the
trenches
history
has
created
a
big
gulf
between
the
higher
classes
and
the
lower
unprincipled
combinations
of
these
leaders
of
another
day
leaders
made
antiquated
by
the
revolution
were
doomed
to
inevitable
failure
it
was
necessary
to
depend
wholly
and
confidently
upon
the
masses
in
order
jointly
with
them
to
overcome
the
sabotage
and
the
aristocratic
pretensions
of
the
upper
classes
we
left
it
to
the
left
to
continue
the
hopeless
efforts
for
coalition
our
policy
was
on
the
contrary
to
line
up
the
toiling
lower
classes
against
the
representatives
of
organizations
which
supported
the
kerensky
regime
this
uncompromising
policy
caused
considerable
friction
and
even
division
in
the
upper
circles
of
our
party
in
the
central
executive
committee
the
left
social
revolutionists
protested
against
the
severity
of
our
measures
and
insisted
upon
the
necessity
for
compromises
they
met
with
support
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
bolsheviki
three
people
commissaries
gave
up
their
portfolios
and
left
the
government
a
few
other
party
leaders
sided
with
them
in
principle
this
created
a
very
deep
impression
in
intellectual
and
bourgeois
circles
if
the
bolsheviki
could
not
be
defeated
by
the
cadets
and
krassnov
cossacks
thought
they
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
soviet
government
must
now
perish
as
a
result
of
internal
dissension
however
the
masses
never
noticed
this
dissension
at
all
they
unanimously
supported
the
soviet
of
people
commissaries
not
only
against
instigators
and
sabotagers
but
also
against
the
coalitionists
and
the
skeptics
the
fate
of
the
constituent
assembly
when
after
the
korniloff
episode
the
ruling
soviet
parties
tried
to
smooth
over
their
laxness
toward
the
bourgeoisie
they
demanded
a
speedier
convocation
of
the
constituent
assembly
kerensky
whom
the
soviets
had
just
saved
from
the
too
light
embraces
of
his
ally
korniloff
found
himself
compelled
to
make
compromises
the
call
for
the
constituent
assembly
was
issued
for
the
end
of
november
by
that
time
however
circumstances
had
so
shaped
themselves
that
there
was
no
guarantee
whatever
that
the
constituent
assembly
would
really
be
convoked
the
greatest
degree
of
disorganization
was
taking
place
at
the
front
desertions
were
increasing
every
day
the
masses
of
soldiers
threatened
to
leave
the
trenches
whole
regiments
at
a
time
and
move
to
the
rear
devastating
everything
on
their
way
in
the
villages
a
general
seizure
of
lands
and
landholders
utensils
was
going
on
martial
law
had
been
declared
in
several
provinces
the
germans
continued
to
advance
captured
riga
and
threatened
petrograd
the
right
wing
of
the
bourgeoisie
was
openly
rejoicing
over
the
danger
that
threatened
the
revolutionary
capital
the
government
offices
at
petrograd
were
being
evacuated
and
kerensky
government
was
preparing
to
move
to
moscow
all
this
made
the
actual
convocation
of
the
constituent
assembly
not
only
doubtful
but
hardly
even
probable
from
this
point
of
view
the
october
revolution
seems
to
have
been
the
deliverance
of
the
constituent
assembly
as
it
has
been
the
savior
of
the
revolution
generally
when
we
were
declaring
that
the
road
to
the
constituent
assembly
was
not
by
way
of
tseretelli
preliminary
parliament
but
by
way
of
the
seizure
of
the
reigns
of
government
by
the
soviets
we
were
quite
sincere
but
the
interminable
delay
in
convoking
the
constituent
assembly
was
not
without
effect
upon
this
institution
itself
heralded
in
the
first
days
of
the
revolution
it
came
into
being
only
after
eight
or
nine
months
of
bitter
class
and
party
struggle
it
came
too
late
to
play
a
creative
role
its
internal
inadequacy
had
been
predetermined
by
a
single
fact
a
fact
which
might
seem
unimportant
at
first
but
which
subsequently
took
on
tremendous
importance
for
the
fate
of
the
constituent
assembly
numerically
the
principal
revolutionary
party
in
the
first
epoch
was
the
party
of
i
have
already
referred
to
its
formlessness
and
variegated
composition
the
revolution
led
inevitably
to
the
dismemberment
of
such
of
its
members
as
had
joined
it
under
the
banner
of
populism
the
left
wing
which
had
a
following
among
part
of
the
workers
and
the
vast
masses
of
poor
peasants
was
becoming
more
and
more
alienated
from
the
rest
this
wing
found
itself
in
uncompromising
opposition
to
the
party
and
middle
bourgeois
branches
of
social
revolutionists
but
the
inertness
of
party
organization
and
party
tradition
held
back
the
inevitable
process
of
cleavage
the
proportional
system
of
elections
still
holds
full
sway
as
every
one
knows
in
party
lists
since
these
lists
were
made
up
two
or
three
months
before
the
october
revolution
and
were
not
subject
to
change
the
left
and
the
right
social
revolutionists
still
figured
in
these
lists
as
one
and
the
same
party
thus
by
the
time
of
the
october
revolution
that
is
the
period
when
the
right
social
revolutionists
were
arresting
the
left
and
then
the
left
were
combining
with
the
bolsheviki
for
the
overthrow
of
kerensky
ministry
the
old
lists
remained
in
full
force
and
in
the
elections
for
the
constituent
assembly
the
peasants
were
compelled
to
vote
for
lists
of
names
at
the
head
of
which
stood
kerensky
followed
by
those
of
left
social
revolutionists
who
participated
in
the
plot
for
his
overthrow
if
the
months
preceding
the
october
revolution
were
months
of
continuous
gain
in
popular
support
for
the
left
of
a
general
increase
in
bolshevik
following
among
workers
soldiers
and
peasants
then
this
process
was
reflected
within
the
party
of
social
revolutionists
in
an
increase
of
the
left
wing
at
the
expense
of
the
right
nevertheless
on
the
party
lists
of
the
social
revolutionists
there
was
a
predominance
of
three
to
one
of
old
leaders
of
the
right
wing
of
men
who
had
lost
all
their
revolutionary
reputation
in
the
days
of
coalition
with
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
to
this
should
be
added
also
the
fact
that
the
elections
themselves
were
held
during
the
first
weeks
after
the
october
revolution
the
news
of
the
change
traveled
rather
slowly
from
the
capital
to
the
provinces
from
the
cities
to
the
villages
the
peasantry
in
many
places
had
but
a
very
vague
idea
of
what
was
taking
place
in
petrograd
and
moscow
they
voted
for
land
and
liberty
for
their
representatives
in
the
land
committees
who
in
most
cases
gathered
under
the
banner
of
populism
but
thereby
they
were
voting
for
kerensky
and
avksentiev
who
were
dissolving
the
land
committees
and
arresting
their
members
as
a
result
of
this
there
came
about
the
strange
political
paradox
that
one
of
the
two
parties
which
dissolved
the
constituent
assembly
the
left
had
won
its
representation
by
being
on
the
same
list
of
names
with
the
party
which
gave
a
majority
to
the
constituent
assembly
this
phase
of
the
question
should
give
a
very
clear
idea
of
the
extent
to
which
the
constituent
assembly
lagged
behind
the
course
of
political
events
and
party
groupings
we
must
consider
the
question
of
principles
the
principles
of
democracy
and
proletarian
dictatorship
as
marxists
we
have
never
been
of
formal
democracy
in
a
society
of
classes
democratic
institutions
not
only
do
not
eliminate
class
struggle
but
also
give
to
class
interests
an
utterly
imperfect
expression
the
propertied
classes
always
have
at
their
disposal
tens
and
hundreds
of
means
for
falsifying
subverting
and
violating
the
will
of
the
toilers
and
democratic
institutions
become
a
still
less
perfect
medium
for
the
expression
of
the
class
struggle
under
revolutionary
circumstances
marx
called
revolutions
the
locomotives
of
history
owing
to
the
open
and
direct
struggle
for
power
the
working
people
acquire
much
political
experience
in
a
short
time
and
pass
rapidly
from
one
stage
to
the
next
in
their
development
the
ponderous
machinery
of
democratic
institutions
lags
behind
this
evolution
all
the
more
the
bigger
the
country
and
the
less
perfect
its
technical
apparatus
the
majority
in
the
constituent
assembly
proved
to
be
social
revolutionists
and
according
to
parliamentary
rules
of
procedure
the
control
of
the
government
belonged
to
them
but
the
party
of
right
social
revolutionists
had
a
chance
to
acquire
control
during
the
entire
period
of
the
revolution
yet
they
avoided
the
responsibilities
of
government
leaving
the
lion
share
of
it
to
the
liberal
bourgeoisie
by
this
very
course
the
right
social
revolutionists
lost
the
last
vestiges
of
their
influence
with
the
revolutionary
elements
by
the
time
the
numerical
composition
of
the
constituent
assembly
formally
obliged
them
to
form
a
government
the
working
class
as
well
as
the
red
guards
were
very
hostile
to
the
party
of
right
social
revolutionists
the
vast
majority
of
soldiers
supported
the
bolsheviki
the
revolutionary
element
in
the
provinces
divided
their
sympathies
between
the
left
social
revolutionists
and
the
bolsheviki
the
sailors
who
had
played
such
an
important
role
in
revolutionary
events
were
almost
unanimously
on
our
side
the
right
social
revolutionists
moreover
had
to
leave
the
soviets
which
in
october
that
is
before
the
convocation
of
the
constituent
assembly
had
taken
the
government
into
their
own
hands
on
whom
then
could
a
ministry
formed
by
the
constituent
assembly
majority
depend
for
support
it
would
be
backed
by
the
upper
classes
in
the
provinces
the
intellectuals
the
government
officials
and
temporarily
by
the
bourgeoisie
on
the
right
but
such
a
government
would
lack
all
the
material
means
of
administration
at
such
a
political
center
as
petrograd
it
would
encounter
irresistible
opposition
from
the
very
start
if
under
these
circumstances
the
soviets
submitting
to
the
formal
logic
of
democratic
conventions
had
turned
the
government
over
to
the
party
of
kerensky
and
chernov
such
a
government
compromised
and
debilitated
as
it
was
would
only
introduce
temporary
confusion
into
the
political
life
of
the
country
and
would
be
overthrown
by
a
new
uprising
in
a
few
weeks
the
soviets
decided
to
reduce
this
belated
historical
experiment
to
its
lowest
terms
and
dissolved
the
constituent
assembly
the
very
first
day
it
met
for
this
our
party
has
been
most
severely
censured
the
dispersal
of
the
constituent
assembly
has
also
created
a
decidedly
unfavorable
impression
among
the
leading
circles
of
the
european
socialist
parties
kautsky
has
explained
in
a
series
of
articles
written
with
his
characteristic
pedantry
the
interrelation
existing
between
the
problems
of
the
proletariat
and
the
regime
of
political
democracy
he
tries
to
prove
that
for
the
working
class
it
is
always
expedient
in
the
long
run
to
preserve
the
essential
elements
of
the
democratic
order
this
is
of
course
true
as
a
general
rule
but
kautsky
has
reduced
this
historical
truth
to
professorial
banality
if
in
the
final
analysis
it
is
to
the
advantage
of
the
proletariat
to
introduce
its
class
struggle
and
even
its
dictatorship
through
the
channels
of
democratic
institutions
it
does
not
at
all
follow
that
history
always
affords
it
the
opportunity
for
attaining
this
happy
consummation
there
is
nothing
in
the
marxian
theory
to
warrant
the
deduction
that
history
always
creates
such
conditions
as
are
most
favorable
to
the
proletariat
it
is
difficult
to
tell
now
how
the
course
of
the
revolution
would
have
run
if
the
constituent
assembly
had
been
convoked
in
its
second
or
third
month
it
is
quite
probable
that
the
then
dominant
social
revolutionary
and
menshevik
parties
would
have
compromised
themselves
together
with
the
constituent
assembly
in
the
eyes
of
not
only
the
more
active
elements
supporting
the
soviets
but
also
of
the
more
backward
democratic
masses
who
might
have
been
attached
through
their
expectations
not
to
the
side
of
the
soviets
but
to
that
of
the
constituent
assembly
under
such
circumstances
the
dissolution
of
the
constituent
assembly
might
have
led
to
new
elections
in
which
the
party
of
the
left
could
have
secured
a
majority
but
the
course
of
events
has
been
different
the
elections
for
the
constituent
assembly
occurred
in
the
ninth
month
of
the
revolution
by
that
time
the
class
struggle
had
assumed
such
intensity
that
it
broke
the
formal
frames
of
democracy
by
sheer
internal
force
the
proletariat
drew
the
army
and
the
peasantry
after
it
these
classes
were
in
a
state
of
direct
and
bitter
war
with
the
right
social
revolutionists
this
party
owing
to
the
clumsy
electoral
democratic
machinery
received
a
majority
in
the
constituent
assembly
reflecting
the
epoch
of
the
revolution
the
result
was
a
contradiction
which
was
absolutely
irreducible
within
the
limits
of
formal
democracy
and
only
political
pedants
who
do
not
take
into
account
the
revolutionary
logic
of
class
relations
can
in
the
face
of
the
situation
deliver
futile
lectures
to
the
proletariat
on
the
benefits
and
advantages
of
democracy
for
the
cause
of
the
class
struggle
the
question
was
put
by
history
far
more
concretely
and
sharply
the
constituent
assembly
owing
to
the
character
of
its
majority
was
bound
to
turn
over
the
government
to
the
chernov
kerensky
and
tseretelli
group
could
this
group
have
guided
the
destinies
of
the
revolution
could
it
have
found
support
in
that
class
which
constitutes
the
backbone
of
the
revolution
no
the
real
kernel
of
the
class
revolution
has
come
into
irreconcilable
conflict
with
its
democratic
shell
by
this
situation
the
fate
of
the
constituent
assembly
had
been
sealed
its
dissolution
became
the
only
possible
surgical
remedy
for
the
contradiction
which
had
been
created
not
by
us
but
by
all
the
preceding
course
of
events
peace
negotiations
at
the
historic
night
session
of
the
second
congress
of
the
soviets
the
decree
on
peace
was
adopted
the
full
text
is
printed
in
the
appendix
at
that
moment
the
soviet
government
was
only
becoming
established
in
the
important
centers
of
the
country
and
there
was
very
little
confidence
abroad
in
its
power
the
soviet
adopted
the
decree
unanimously
but
this
seemed
to
many
no
more
than
a
political
demonstration
those
who
were
for
a
compromise
preached
at
every
opportunity
that
our
resolution
would
bring
no
results
for
on
the
one
hand
the
german
imperialists
would
not
recognize
and
would
not
deal
with
us
on
the
other
hand
our
allies
would
declare
war
upon
us
as
soon
as
we
should
start
negotiating
a
separate
peace
under
the
shadow
of
these
predictions
we
took
our
first
steps
to
secure
a
general
democratic
peace
the
decree
was
adopted
on
the
of
october
when
kerensky
and
krassnov
were
at
the
gates
of
petrograd
on
the
of
november
we
addressed
by
wireless
an
invitation
to
our
allies
and
enemies
to
conclude
a
general
peace
in
reply
the
allied
governments
addressed
to
general
dukhonin
then
through
their
military
attaches
a
communication
stating
that
further
steps
to
separate
peace
negotiations
would
lead
to
the
gravest
consequences
to
this
protest
we
answered
the
of
november
by
appealing
to
all
the
workers
soldiers
and
peasants
in
this
appeal
we
declared
that
under
no
circumstances
would
we
permit
our
army
to
shed
its
blood
under
the
club
of
the
foreign
bourgeoisie
we
swept
aside
the
threat
of
the
western
imperialists
and
took
upon
ourselves
the
responsibility
for
our
peace
policy
before
the
international
working
class
first
of
all
we
published
in
accordance
with
our
promises
made
as
a
matter
of
principle
the
secret
treaties
and
declared
that
we
would
relinquish
everything
in
these
treaties
that
was
against
the
interests
of
the
masses
of
the
people
in
all
countries
the
capitalist
governments
made
an
attempt
to
make
use
of
our
disclosures
against
one
another
but
the
masses
of
the
people
understood
and
recognized
us
not
a
single
social
patriotic
publication
as
far
as
we
know
dared
to
protest
against
having
all
the
methods
of
diplomacy
radically
changed
by
a
government
of
peasants
and
workers
they
dared
not
protest
against
us
for
denouncing
the
dishonest
cunning
chicanery
and
cheating
of
the
old
diplomacy
we
made
it
the
task
of
our
diplomacy
to
enlighten
the
masses
of
the
peoples
to
open
their
eyes
to
the
real
meaning
of
the
policy
of
their
governments
in
order
to
weld
them
together
in
a
common
struggle
and
a
common
hatred
against
the
bourgeois
capitalist
order
the
german
bourgeois
press
accused
us
of
dragging
on
the
peace
negotiations
but
all
nations
anxiously
followed
the
discussions
at
and
in
this
way
we
rendered
during
the
two
months
and
a
half
of
peace
negotiations
a
service
to
the
cause
of
peace
which
was
recognized
even
by
the
more
honest
of
our
enemies
the
question
of
peace
was
first
put
before
the
world
in
a
shape
which
made
it
impossible
to
it
any
longer
by
machinations
behind
the
scenes
on
the
of
november
a
truce
was
signed
to
discontinue
military
activities
on
the
entire
front
from
the
baltic
to
the
black
sea
once
more
we
requested
our
allies
to
join
us
and
to
conduct
together
with
us
the
peace
negotiations
there
was
no
reply
though
this
time
the
allies
did
not
again
attempt
to
frighten
us
by
threats
the
peace
negotiations
were
started
december
a
month
and
a
half
after
the
peace
decree
was
adopted
the
accusations
of
the
purchased
press
and
of
the
press
that
we
had
made
no
attempt
to
agree
with
our
allies
on
a
common
policy
was
therefore
entirely
false
for
a
month
and
a
half
we
kept
our
allies
informed
about
every
step
we
made
and
always
called
upon
them
to
become
a
party
to
the
peace
negotiations
our
conscience
is
clear
before
the
peoples
of
france
italy
and
great
britain
we
did
all
in
our
power
to
get
all
the
belligerents
to
join
the
peace
negotiations
if
we
were
compelled
to
start
separate
peace
negotiations
it
was
not
because
of
any
fault
of
ours
but
because
of
the
western
imperialists
as
well
as
those
of
the
russian
parties
which
continued
predicting
the
approaching
destruction
of
the
workmen
and
peasants
government
of
russia
and
who
persuaded
the
allies
not
to
pay
serious
attention
to
our
peace
initiative
but
be
that
as
it
may
on
the
of
december
the
peace
conversations
were
started
our
delegation
made
a
statement
of
principles
which
set
forth
the
basis
of
a
general
democratic
peace
in
the
exact
expressions
of
the
decree
of
the
of
october
of
november
the
other
side
demanded
that
the
session
be
broken
off
and
the
reopening
of
the
sessions
was
later
at
the
suggestion
of
kuehlmann
repeatedly
delayed
it
was
clear
that
the
delegation
of
the
teuton
allies
experienced
no
small
difficulty
in
the
formulation
of
its
reply
to
our
delegation
on
the
of
december
this
reply
was
given
the
diplomats
of
the
teuton
allies
expressed
agreement
with
our
democratic
formula
of
peace
without
annexations
and
indemnities
on
the
basis
of
of
peoples
we
saw
clearly
that
this
was
but
pretense
but
we
had
not
expected
even
that
they
would
try
to
pretend
because
as
the
french
writer
has
said
hypocrisy
is
the
tribute
that
vice
pays
to
virtue
the
fact
that
the
german
imperialists
found
it
necessary
to
make
this
tribute
to
the
principles
of
democracy
was
in
our
eyes
evidence
that
the
situation
of
affairs
within
germany
was
serious
enough
but
if
we
generally
speaking
had
no
illusions
concerning
the
love
for
democracy
of
kuehlmann
and
czernin
we
know
well
enough
the
nature
of
the
german
and
dominating
classes
it
must
nevertheless
be
admitted
that
we
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
chasm
which
separated
the
real
intentions
of
german
imperialism
from
those
principles
which
were
put
forth
on
the
of
december
by
von
kuehlmann
as
a
parody
on
the
russian
revolution
a
chasm
which
was
revealed
so
strikingly
a
few
days
later
such
audacity
we
had
never
expected
kuehlmann
reply
made
a
tremendous
impression
upon
the
working
masses
of
russia
it
was
interpreted
as
a
result
of
the
fear
felt
by
the
dominant
classes
of
the
central
empires
because
of
the
discontent
and
the
growing
impatience
of
the
working
masses
of
germany
on
the
of
december
there
took
place
in
petrograd
a
joint
demonstration
of
workmen
and
soldiers
for
a
democratic
peace
the
next
morning
our
delegation
came
back
from
and
brought
those
brigand
demands
which
von
kuehlmann
made
to
us
in
the
name
of
the
central
empires
as
an
interpretation
of
his
democratic
formulae
at
the
first
glance
it
may
seem
incomprehensible
why
the
german
diplomacy
should
have
presented
its
democratic
formulae
if
it
intended
within
two
or
three
days
to
disclose
its
wolfish
appetite
what
was
it
that
the
german
diplomacy
expected
to
bring
about
at
least
the
theoretic
discussions
which
developed
around
the
democratic
formulae
owing
largely
to
the
initiative
of
kuehlmann
himself
were
not
without
their
danger
that
the
diplomacy
of
the
central
empires
could
not
reap
many
laurels
in
that
way
must
have
been
clear
beforehand
to
that
diplomacy
itself
but
the
secret
of
the
conduct
of
the
diplomacy
of
kuehlmann
consisted
in
that
that
gentleman
was
sincerely
convinced
of
our
readiness
to
play
a
game
with
him
his
way
of
reasoning
was
approximately
as
follows
russia
needs
peace
the
bolsheviki
got
the
power
because
of
their
struggle
for
peace
the
bolsheviki
desire
to
remain
in
power
and
this
is
possible
for
them
only
on
condition
that
peace
is
concluded
it
is
true
that
they
bound
themselves
to
a
definite
democratic
program
of
peace
but
why
do
diplomats
exist
if
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
black
look
white
we
germans
will
make
it
easier
for
the
bolsheviki
by
covering
our
plunders
by
democratic
formulas
the
bolshevist
diplomacy
will
have
plenty
of
reason
not
to
dig
for
the
political
essence
of
the
matter
or
rather
not
to
expose
to
the
entire
world
the
contents
of
the
enticing
formulae
in
other
words
kuehlmann
relied
upon
a
silent
agreement
with
us
he
would
return
to
us
our
fine
formulas
and
we
should
give
him
a
chance
to
get
provinces
and
peoples
for
germany
without
a
protest
in
the
eyes
of
the
german
workers
the
annexations
by
force
would
thus
receive
the
sanction
of
the
russian
revolution
when
during
the
discussions
we
showed
that
with
us
it
was
not
a
matter
of
empty
words
or
of
camouflaging
a
conspiracy
concluded
behind
the
scenes
but
a
matter
of
democratic
principles
for
the
international
life
of
the
community
of
nations
kuehlmann
took
it
as
a
willful
and
malicious
breaking
of
the
silent
agreement
he
would
not
by
any
means
recede
from
the
position
taken
in
the
formulas
of
the
of
december
relying
upon
his
cunning
bureaucratic
and
judicial
logic
he
tried
in
the
face
of
the
entire
world
to
show
that
white
is
in
no
way
different
from
black
and
it
was
our
own
perverseness
which
made
us
insist
that
there
was
such
a
difference
count
czernin
the
representative
of
played
a
part
in
those
negotiations
which
no
one
would
consider
inspiring
or
satisfactory
he
was
an
awkward
second
and
upon
instructions
from
kuehlmann
took
it
upon
himself
in
all
critical
moments
to
utter
the
most
extreme
and
cynical
declarations
general
hoffmann
brought
a
refreshing
note
into
the
negotiations
showing
no
great
sympathy
for
the
diplomatic
constructions
of
kuehlmann
the
general
several
times
put
his
soldierly
boot
upon
the
table
around
which
a
complicated
judicial
debate
was
developing
we
on
our
part
did
not
doubt
for
a
single
minute
that
just
this
boot
of
general
hoffmann
was
the
only
element
of
serious
reality
in
these
negotiations
the
important
trump
in
the
hands
of
kuehlmann
was
the
participation
in
the
negotiations
of
a
delegation
of
the
kiev
rada
for
the
ukrainian
middle
classes
who
had
seized
the
power
the
most
important
factor
seemed
to
be
the
recognition
of
their
government
by
the
capitalist
governments
of
europe
at
first
the
rada
placed
itself
at
the
disposal
of
the
allied
imperialists
received
from
them
some
pocket
money
and
immediately
thereupon
sent
their
representatives
to
in
order
to
make
a
bargain
behind
the
back
of
the
russian
people
with
the
government
of
for
the
recognition
of
the
legitimate
birth
of
their
government
they
had
hardly
taken
this
first
step
on
the
road
to
international
existence
when
the
kiev
diplomacy
revealed
the
same
and
the
same
moral
standards
which
were
always
so
characteristic
of
the
petty
politicians
of
the
balkan
peninsula
kuehlmann
and
czernin
certainly
had
no
illusions
concerning
the
solidity
of
the
new
participant
in
the
negotiations
but
they
thought
and
correctly
so
that
the
participation
of
the
kiev
delegation
complicated
the
game
not
without
advantage
for
themselves
at
its
first
appearance
at
the
kiev
delegation
characterized
ukraine
as
a
component
part
of
the
russian
federated
republic
that
was
in
progress
of
formation
this
apparently
embarrassed
the
diplomats
of
the
central
empires
who
considered
it
their
main
task
to
convert
the
russian
republic
into
a
new
balkan
peninsula
at
their
second
appearance
the
delegates
of
the
rada
declared
under
dictation
from
the
diplomacy
that
ukraine
refused
to
join
the
russian
federation
and
was
becoming
an
entirely
independent
republic
in
order
to
give
the
reader
an
opportunity
to
get
a
better
idea
of
the
situation
which
was
thus
created
for
the
soviet
power
in
the
last
moment
of
the
peace
negotiations
i
think
it
best
to
reproduce
here
in
its
basic
parts
the
address
made
by
the
author
of
these
lines
in
his
capacity
as
the
people
commissar
on
foreign
affairs
at
the
session
of
the
central
executive
committee
on
the
of
february
address
of
the
peoples
commissar
on
foreign
affairs
comrades
upon
soviet
russia
has
fallen
the
task
not
only
to
construct
the
new
but
also
to
recapitulate
the
old
to
a
certain
degree
or
rather
to
a
very
large
degree
to
pay
all
bills
first
of
all
the
bills
of
the
war
which
has
lasted
three
and
a
half
years
the
war
put
the
economic
power
of
the
belligerent
countries
to
a
severe
test
the
fate
of
russia
a
poor
backward
country
in
a
protracted
war
was
predetermined
in
the
terrible
collision
of
the
military
machines
the
determining
factor
after
all
is
said
and
done
is
the
ability
of
the
country
to
adapt
its
industries
to
the
military
needs
to
rebuild
it
on
the
shortest
notice
and
to
produce
in
continuously
increasing
quantities
the
weapons
of
destruction
which
are
used
up
at
such
an
enormous
rate
during
this
massacre
of
peoples
almost
every
country
including
the
most
backward
could
and
did
have
powerful
weapons
of
destruction
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
that
is
it
obtained
them
from
foreign
countries
that
is
what
all
the
backward
countries
did
and
so
did
russia
but
the
war
speedily
wears
out
its
dead
capital
demanding
that
it
be
continuously
replenished
the
military
power
of
every
single
country
drawn
into
the
whirlpool
of
the
world
massacre
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
measured
by
its
ability
to
produce
independently
and
during
the
war
itself
its
cannons
and
shells
and
the
other
weapons
of
destruction
if
the
war
had
decided
the
problem
of
the
balance
of
power
in
a
very
short
time
russia
might
conceivably
have
turned
out
to
be
on
that
side
of
the
trenches
which
victory
favored
but
the
war
dragged
along
for
a
long
time
and
it
was
not
an
accident
that
it
did
so
the
fact
alone
that
the
international
politics
were
for
the
last
fifty
years
reduced
to
the
construction
of
the
european
balance
of
power
that
is
to
a
state
in
which
the
hostile
powers
approximately
balance
one
another
this
fact
alone
was
bound
when
the
power
and
wealth
of
the
present
bourgeois
nations
is
considered
to
make
it
a
war
of
an
extremely
protracted
character
that
meant
first
of
all
the
exhaustion
of
the
weaker
and
economically
less
developed
countries
the
most
powerful
country
in
a
military
sense
proved
to
be
germany
because
of
the
strength
of
the
industries
and
because
of
their
modern
and
rational
construction
as
against
the
archaic
construction
of
the
german
state
france
with
its
undeveloped
state
of
capitalism
proved
to
be
far
behind
germany
and
even
such
a
powerful
colonial
power
as
great
britain
owing
to
the
conservative
and
routine
character
of
the
english
industries
proved
to
be
weaker
than
germany
when
history
put
before
the
russian
revolution
the
question
of
the
peace
negotiations
we
had
no
doubt
that
in
these
negotiations
and
so
long
as
the
decisive
power
of
the
revolutionary
proletariat
of
the
world
had
not
interfered
we
should
be
compelled
to
stand
the
bill
of
three
and
a
half
years
of
war
there
was
no
doubt
in
our
minds
that
in
the
person
of
the
german
imperialism
we
were
dealing
with
an
opponent
who
was
saturated
with
the
consciousness
of
his
immense
power
which
was
strikingly
revealed
during
the
present
war
all
the
arguments
made
by
bourgeois
cliques
that
we
might
have
been
incomparably
stronger
if
we
had
conducted
these
negotiations
together
with
our
allies
are
absolutely
without
foundation
in
order
that
we
might
at
an
indefinite
future
date
conduct
negotiations
together
with
our
allies
we
should
first
of
all
have
had
to
continue
the
war
together
with
them
and
if
our
country
was
weakened
and
exhausted
the
continuation
of
the
war
a
failure
to
bring
it
to
a
conclusion
would
have
still
further
weakened
and
exhausted
it
we
should
have
had
to
settle
the
war
under
conditions
still
more
unfavorable
to
us
in
the
case
even
that
the
combination
of
which
russia
owing
to
international
intrigues
of
czarism
and
the
bourgeoisie
had
become
a
part
the
combination
headed
by
great
britain
in
the
case
even
that
this
combination
had
come
out
of
the
war
completely
victorious
let
us
for
a
moment
admit
the
possibility
of
such
a
not
very
probable
issue
even
in
that
case
comrades
it
does
not
mean
that
our
country
would
also
have
come
out
victorious
for
during
further
continuation
of
this
protracted
war
russia
would
have
become
even
more
exhausted
and
plundered
than
now
the
masters
of
that
combination
who
would
concentrate
in
their
hands
the
fruits
of
the
victory
that
is
great
britain
and
america
would
have
displayed
toward
our
country
the
same
methods
which
were
displayed
by
germany
during
the
peace
negotiations
it
would
be
absurd
and
childish
to
appraise
the
politics
of
the
imperialistic
countries
from
the
point
of
view
of
any
considerations
other
than
those
considerations
of
naked
interests
and
material
power
consequently
if
we
as
a
nation
are
at
present
weakened
before
the
imperialism
of
the
world
we
are
weakened
not
because
of
extricating
ourselves
from
the
fiery
ring
of
the
war
having
already
previously
extricated
ourselves
from
the
shackles
of
international
military
obligations
no
we
are
weakened
by
that
very
policy
of
the
czarists
and
the
bourgeois
classes
which
we
as
a
revolutionary
party
have
always
fought
against
before
this
war
and
during
this
war
you
remember
comrades
under
what
conditions
our
delegation
went
to
last
time
right
after
one
of
the
sessions
of
the
third
congress
of
the
soviets
at
that
session
we
reported
on
the
state
of
the
negotiations
and
the
demands
of
our
opponents
these
demands
as
you
remember
were
really
no
more
than
masked
or
rather
annexationist
aspirations
at
the
expense
of
lithuania
courland
a
part
of
livonia
the
isles
of
moon
sound
as
well
as
a
demand
for
a
punitive
war
indemnity
which
we
then
estimated
would
amount
to
six
eight
or
even
ten
milliards
of
rubles
during
interruption
of
the
sessions
which
continued
for
about
ten
days
a
considerable
disturbance
took
place
in
strikes
of
masses
of
workers
broke
out
and
these
strikes
were
the
first
recognition
of
our
methods
of
conducting
peace
negotiations
that
we
met
with
from
the
proletariat
of
the
central
empires
as
against
the
annexationist
demands
of
the
german
militarism
we
promised
here
no
miracles
but
we
did
say
that
the
road
we
were
pursuing
was
the
only
road
remaining
to
the
revolutionary
democracy
for
securing
the
possibility
of
its
further
development
there
is
room
for
complaint
that
the
proletariat
of
the
other
countries
and
particularly
of
the
central
empires
is
too
slow
to
enter
the
road
of
open
revolutionary
struggle
yes
it
must
be
admitted
that
the
pace
of
its
development
is
all
too
slow
but
nevertheless
there
could
be
observed
a
movement
in
which
swept
the
entire
state
and
which
was
a
direct
echo
of
the
negotiations
leaving
for
it
was
our
common
opinion
that
there
was
no
ground
to
believe
that
just
this
wave
would
sweep
away
the
militarism
if
we
had
been
convinced
that
this
could
be
expected
we
would
gladly
have
given
the
promise
that
several
persons
demanded
from
us
namely
that
under
no
circumstances
would
we
sign
a
separate
peace
with
germany
i
said
at
that
very
time
that
we
could
not
make
such
a
promise
for
it
would
amount
to
taking
upon
ourselves
the
obligation
of
vanquishing
the
german
militarism
the
secret
of
attaining
such
a
victory
was
not
in
our
possession
and
inasmuch
as
we
would
not
undertake
the
obligation
to
change
the
balance
of
the
world
powers
at
a
moment
notice
we
frankly
and
openly
declared
that
revolutionary
power
may
under
certain
conditions
be
compelled
to
agree
to
an
annexationist
peace
a
revolutionary
power
would
fall
short
of
its
high
principles
only
in
the
event
that
it
should
attempt
to
conceal
from
its
own
people
the
predatory
character
of
the
peace
but
by
no
means
however
in
the
event
that
the
course
of
the
struggle
should
compel
it
to
adopt
such
a
peace
at
the
same
time
we
indicated
that
we
were
leaving
to
continue
negotiations
under
conditions
which
were
seemingly
improving
for
us
and
becoming
worse
for
our
enemies
we
observed
the
movement
in
and
there
were
signs
indicating
this
was
made
the
basis
for
statements
by
representatives
of
the
german
social
democracy
in
the
reichstag
that
germany
was
on
the
eve
of
similar
events
we
went
with
this
hope
during
the
first
days
of
this
visit
to
the
wireless
brought
us
from
vilna
the
first
news
that
in
berlin
an
enormous
strike
movement
was
developing
this
movement
as
well
as
that
of
was
directly
connected
with
the
course
of
negotiations
in
brest
however
as
is
often
the
case
by
reason
of
the
dialectic
of
the
class
struggle
just
this
conspicuous
beginning
of
the
proletarian
rising
which
surpassed
anything
germany
had
ever
seen
was
bound
to
push
the
property
classes
to
a
closer
consolidation
and
to
greater
hostility
against
the
proletariat
the
german
dominating
classes
are
saturated
with
a
sufficiently
strong
instinct
of
to
understand
that
concessions
in
such
an
exigency
as
they
were
in
under
the
pressure
of
the
masses
of
their
own
people
concessions
however
small
would
amount
to
capitulation
before
the
idea
of
the
revolution
that
is
why
after
the
first
moment
of
perplexity
and
panic
the
time
when
kuehlmann
deliberately
dragged
out
the
negotiations
by
minor
and
formal
questions
had
passed
as
soon
as
the
strikes
were
disposed
of
as
soon
as
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
for
the
time
being
no
imminent
danger
threatened
his
masters
he
again
changed
front
and
adopted
a
tone
of
unlimited
and
aggression
our
negotiations
were
complicated
by
the
participation
of
the
kiev
rada
we
called
attention
to
this
last
time
too
the
delegation
from
the
kiev
rada
appeared
at
a
time
when
the
rada
represented
a
fairly
strong
organization
in
the
ukraine
and
when
the
way
out
of
the
war
had
not
yet
been
predetermined
just
at
that
time
we
made
the
rada
an
official
offer
to
conclude
a
definite
treaty
with
us
making
as
one
of
the
conditions
of
such
a
treaty
the
following
demand
that
the
rada
declare
kaledin
and
korniloff
to
be
and
put
no
hindrance
in
the
way
of
our
waging
war
on
these
two
leaders
the
delegation
from
the
kiev
rada
arrived
just
when
we
hoped
to
reach
an
understanding
with
it
on
these
matters
we
declared
that
as
long
as
the
people
of
the
ukraine
recognized
the
rada
we
considered
its
independent
participation
in
these
negotiations
permissible
but
with
the
further
development
of
events
in
russian
territory
and
in
the
ukraine
and
the
more
the
antagonism
between
the
ukrainian
masses
and
the
rada
increased
the
greater
became
the
rada
readiness
to
conclude
any
kind
of
treaty
with
the
governments
of
the
central
empires
and
if
need
be
to
drag
german
imperialism
into
the
internal
affairs
of
the
russian
republic
in
order
to
support
the
rada
against
the
russian
revolution
on
the
day
of
february
we
learned
that
the
peace
negotiations
carried
on
behind
our
backs
between
the
rada
and
the
central
powers
had
been
signed
the
of
february
happened
to
be
the
birthday
of
leopold
of
bavaria
and
as
is
the
custom
in
monarchical
countries
the
triumphant
historical
act
was
timed
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
kiev
rada
for
this
festive
day
general
hoffmann
had
a
salute
fired
in
honor
of
leopold
of
bavaria
having
previously
asked
permission
to
do
so
of
the
kiev
delegation
since
by
the
treaty
of
peace
had
been
ceded
to
ukraine
events
had
taken
such
a
turn
however
that
at
the
time
general
hoffmann
was
asking
permission
for
a
military
salute
the
kiev
rada
had
but
very
little
territory
left
outside
of
on
the
strength
of
the
telegrams
we
had
received
from
petrograd
we
officially
made
it
known
to
the
central
powers
delegation
that
the
kiev
rada
no
longer
existed
a
circumstance
which
certainly
had
some
bearing
on
the
course
of
the
peace
negotiations
we
suggested
to
count
czernin
that
his
representatives
accompany
our
officers
into
ukrainian
territory
to
ascertain
whether
the
kiev
rada
existed
or
not
czernin
seemed
to
welcome
this
suggestion
but
when
we
asked
him
if
this
meant
that
the
treaty
made
with
the
kiev
delegation
would
not
be
signed
before
the
return
of
his
own
mission
he
hesitated
and
promised
to
ask
kuehlmann
about
it
having
inquired
he
sent
us
an
answer
in
the
negative
this
was
on
february
by
the
they
had
to
sign
the
treaty
this
could
not
be
delayed
not
only
on
account
of
leopold
birthday
but
for
a
more
important
reason
which
kuehlmann
undoubtedly
explained
to
czernin
if
we
should
send
our
representatives
into
the
ukraine
just
now
they
might
really
convince
themselves
that
the
rada
does
not
exist
and
then
we
shall
have
to
face
a
single
delegation
which
would
spoil
our
prospects
in
the
by
the
delegation
we
were
advised
to
put
principle
aside
and
to
place
the
question
on
a
more
practical
plane
then
the
german
delegation
would
be
disposed
to
concessions
it
was
unthinkable
that
the
germans
should
decide
to
continue
the
war
over
say
the
moon
islands
if
you
put
this
demand
in
concrete
form
we
replied
that
we
were
ready
to
look
into
such
concessions
as
their
german
colleagues
were
prepared
to
make
so
far
we
have
been
contending
for
the
of
the
lithuanians
poles
livonians
letts
esthonians
and
other
peoples
and
on
all
these
issues
you
have
told
us
that
such
is
out
of
the
question
now
let
us
see
what
your
plans
are
in
regard
to
the
of
another
people
the
russians
what
designs
and
plans
of
a
military
strategic
nature
are
behind
your
seizure
of
the
moon
islands
for
these
islands
as
an
integral
part
of
an
independent
esthonian
republic
or
as
a
possession
of
the
federated
russian
republic
would
have
only
a
defensive
military
importance
while
in
the
hands
of
germany
they
would
assume
offensive
significance
menacing
the
most
vital
centers
of
our
country
and
especially
petrograd
but
of
course
hoffmann
would
make
no
concessions
whatsoever
then
the
hour
for
reaching
a
decision
had
come
we
could
not
declare
war
for
we
were
too
weak
the
army
had
lost
all
of
its
internal
ties
in
order
to
save
our
country
to
overcome
this
disorganization
it
was
imperative
to
establish
the
internal
coherence
of
the
toilers
this
psychological
tie
can
only
be
created
by
constructive
work
in
factory
field
and
workshop
we
had
to
return
the
masses
of
laborers
who
had
been
subjected
to
great
and
intense
suffering
who
had
experienced
catastrophes
in
the
war
to
the
fields
and
factories
where
they
must
find
themselves
again
and
get
a
footing
in
the
labor
world
and
rebuild
internal
discipline
this
was
the
only
way
to
save
the
country
which
was
now
atoning
for
the
sins
of
czarism
and
the
bourgeoisie
we
had
to
get
out
of
the
war
and
withdraw
the
army
from
the
slaughter
house
nevertheless
we
threw
this
in
the
face
of
the
german
militarism
the
peace
you
are
forcing
down
our
throats
is
a
peace
of
aggression
and
robbery
we
can
not
permit
you
diplomats
to
say
to
the
german
workingmen
you
have
characterized
our
demands
as
avaricious
as
annexationist
but
look
under
these
very
demands
we
have
brought
you
the
signature
of
the
russian
revolution
yes
we
are
weak
we
can
not
fight
at
present
but
we
have
sufficient
revolutionary
courage
to
say
that
we
shall
not
willingly
affix
our
signature
to
the
treaty
which
you
are
writing
with
the
sword
on
the
body
of
living
peoples
we
refused
to
affix
our
signature
i
believe
we
acted
properly
comrades
i
do
not
mean
to
say
friends
that
a
german
advance
upon
russia
is
out
of
the
question
it
were
too
rash
to
make
such
an
assertion
in
view
of
the
great
strength
of
the
german
imperialistic
party
but
i
do
believe
that
the
stand
we
have
taken
in
the
matter
has
rendered
it
far
more
difficult
for
german
militarism
to
advance
upon
us
what
would
happen
if
it
should
advance
to
this
there
is
but
one
thing
to
say
if
it
is
possible
in
our
country
a
country
completely
exhausted
and
in
a
state
of
desperation
to
raise
the
spirits
of
the
more
revolutionary
energetic
elements
if
a
struggle
in
defence
of
our
revolution
and
the
territory
comprised
within
it
is
still
possible
then
this
is
the
case
only
as
a
result
of
our
abandoning
the
war
and
refusing
to
sign
the
peace
treaty
the
second
war
and
the
signing
of
peace
during
the
first
few
days
following
the
breaking
off
of
negotiations
the
german
government
hesitated
not
knowing
what
course
to
pursue
the
politicians
and
diplomats
evidently
thought
that
the
principal
objects
had
been
accomplished
and
that
there
was
no
reason
for
coveting
our
signatures
the
military
men
were
ready
in
any
event
to
break
through
the
lines
drawn
by
the
german
government
at
professor
krigge
the
advisor
of
the
german
delegation
told
a
member
of
our
delegation
that
a
german
invasion
of
russia
under
the
existing
conditions
was
out
of
the
question
count
mirbach
then
at
the
head
of
the
german
missions
at
petrograd
went
to
berlin
with
the
assurance
that
an
agreement
concerning
the
exchange
of
prisoners
of
war
had
been
satisfactorily
reached
but
all
this
did
not
in
the
least
prevent
general
hoffmann
from
declaring
on
the
fifth
day
after
the
negotiations
had
been
broken
off
that
the
armistice
was
over
antedating
the
period
from
the
time
of
the
last
session
it
were
really
out
of
place
to
dilate
here
on
the
moral
indignation
caused
by
this
piece
of
dishonesty
it
fits
in
perfectly
with
the
general
state
of
diplomatic
and
military
morality
of
the
ruling
classes
the
new
german
invasion
developed
under
circumstances
most
fatal
for
russia
instead
of
the
week
notice
agreed
upon
we
received
notice
only
two
days
in
advance
this
circumstance
intensified
the
panic
in
the
army
which
was
already
in
state
of
chronic
dissolution
resistance
was
almost
unthinkable
the
soldiers
could
not
believe
that
the
germans
would
advance
after
we
had
declared
the
state
of
war
at
an
end
the
panicky
retreat
paralyzed
the
will
even
of
such
individual
detachments
as
were
ready
to
make
a
stand
in
the
workingmen
quarters
of
petrograd
and
moscow
the
indignation
against
the
treacherous
and
truly
murderous
german
invasion
reached
a
pitch
of
greatest
intensity
in
these
alarming
days
and
nights
the
workers
were
ready
to
enlist
in
the
army
by
the
ten
thousand
but
the
matter
of
organizing
lagged
far
behind
isolated
tenacious
detachments
full
of
enthusiasm
became
convinced
themselves
of
their
instability
in
their
first
serious
clashes
with
german
regulars
this
still
further
lowered
the
country
spirits
the
old
army
had
long
ago
been
hopelessly
defeated
and
was
going
to
pieces
blocking
all
the
roads
and
byways
the
new
army
owing
to
the
country
general
exhaustion
the
fearful
disorganization
of
industries
and
the
means
of
transportation
was
being
got
together
too
slowly
distance
was
the
only
serious
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
german
invasion
the
chief
attention
of
the
government
was
centered
on
the
ukraine
the
rada
through
its
delegation
had
appealed
to
the
governments
of
the
central
empires
for
direct
military
aid
against
the
soviets
which
had
by
that
time
completely
defeated
the
ukrainians
thus
did
the
democracy
of
the
ukraine
in
its
struggle
against
the
working
class
and
the
destitute
peasants
voluntarily
open
the
gates
to
foreign
invasion
at
the
same
time
the
svinhufvud
government
was
seeking
the
aid
of
german
bayonets
against
the
finnish
proletariat
german
militarism
openly
and
before
the
whole
world
assumed
the
role
of
executioner
of
the
peasant
and
proletarian
revolution
in
russia
in
the
ranks
of
our
party
hot
debates
were
being
carried
on
as
to
whether
or
not
we
should
under
these
circumstances
yield
to
the
german
ultimatum
and
sign
a
new
treaty
which
and
this
no
one
doubted
would
include
conditions
incomparably
more
onerous
than
those
announced
at
the
representatives
of
the
one
view
held
that
just
now
with
the
german
intervention
in
the
internal
war
of
the
russian
republic
it
was
impossible
to
establish
peace
for
one
part
of
russia
and
remain
passive
while
in
the
south
and
in
the
north
german
forces
would
be
establishing
a
regime
of
bourgeois
dictatorship
another
view
championed
chiefly
by
lenin
was
that
every
delay
even
the
briefest
breathing
spell
would
greatly
help
the
internal
stabilization
and
increase
the
russian
powers
of
resistance
after
the
whole
country
and
the
whole
world
had
come
to
know
of
our
absolute
helplessness
against
foreign
invasion
at
this
time
the
conclusion
of
peace
would
everywhere
be
understood
as
an
act
forced
upon
us
by
the
cruel
law
of
disproportionate
forces
it
would
be
childish
to
argue
from
the
standpoint
of
abstract
revolutionary
ethics
the
point
is
not
to
die
with
honor
but
to
achieve
ultimate
victory
the
russian
revolution
wants
to
survive
must
survive
and
must
by
every
means
at
its
disposal
avoid
fighting
an
uneven
battle
and
gain
time
in
the
hope
that
the
western
revolutionary
movement
will
come
to
its
aid
german
imperialism
is
still
engaged
in
a
fierce
annexationist
struggle
with
english
and
american
militarism
only
because
of
this
is
the
conclusion
of
peace
between
russia
and
germany
at
all
possible
we
must
fully
avail
ourselves
of
this
situation
the
welfare
of
the
revolution
is
the
highest
law
we
should
accept
the
peace
which
we
are
unable
to
reject
we
must
secure
a
breathing
spell
to
be
utilized
for
intensive
work
within
the
country
and
especially
for
the
creation
of
an
army
at
the
conference
of
the
communist
party
as
well
as
at
the
fourth
conference
of
the
soviet
the
peace
partisans
triumphed
they
were
joined
by
many
of
those
who
in
january
considered
it
impossible
to
sign
the
treaty
then
said
they
our
signature
would
have
been
looked
upon
by
the
english
and
french
workingmen
as
a
shameful
capitulation
without
an
attempt
to
fight
even
the
base
insinuations
of
the
chauvinists
to
the
secret
compact
between
the
soviet
government
and
the
germans
might
in
case
that
treaty
had
been
signed
find
credence
in
certain
circles
of
european
laborers
but
after
we
had
refused
to
sign
the
treaty
after
a
new
german
invasion
after
our
attempt
to
resist
it
and
after
our
military
weakness
had
become
painfully
obvious
to
the
whole
world
after
all
this
no
one
dare
to
reproach
us
for
surrendering
without
a
fight
the
treaty
in
its
second
enlarged
edition
was
signed
and
ratified
in
the
meantime
the
executioners
were
doing
their
work
in
finland
and
the
ukraine
menacing
more
and
more
the
most
vital
centers
of
great
russia
thus
the
question
of
russia
very
existence
as
an
independent
country
is
henceforth
inseparably
connected
with
the
question
of
the
european
revolution
conclusion
when
our
party
took
over
the
government
we
knew
in
advance
what
difficulties
we
had
to
contend
with
economically
the
country
had
been
exhausted
by
the
war
to
the
very
utmost
the
revolution
had
destroyed
the
old
administrative
machinery
and
could
not
yet
create
anything
to
take
its
place
millions
of
workers
had
been
wrested
from
their
normal
nooks
in
the
national
economy
of
things
declassified
and
physically
shattered
by
the
three
years
war
the
colossal
war
industries
carried
on
on
an
inadequately
prepared
national
foundation
had
drained
all
the
lifeblood
of
the
people
and
their
demobilization
was
attended
with
extreme
difficulties
the
phenomena
of
economic
and
political
anarchy
spread
throughout
the
country
the
russian
peasantry
had
for
centuries
been
held
together
by
barbarian
national
discipline
from
below
and
rule
from
above
economic
development
had
undermined
the
former
the
revolution
destroyed
the
latter
psychologically
the
revolution
meant
the
awakening
of
a
sense
of
human
personality
among
the
peasantry
the
anarchic
manifestations
of
this
awakening
are
but
the
inevitable
results
of
the
preceding
oppression
a
new
order
of
things
an
order
based
on
the
workers
own
control
of
industry
can
come
only
through
gradual
and
internal
elimination
of
the
anarchic
manifestations
of
the
revolution
on
the
other
hand
the
propertied
classes
even
though
deprived
of
political
power
will
not
relinquish
their
advantages
without
a
fight
the
revolution
has
brought
to
a
head
the
question
of
private
property
in
land
and
the
tools
of
production
that
is
the
question
of
vital
significance
to
the
exploiting
classes
politically
this
means
ceaseless
secret
or
open
civil
war
in
its
turn
civil
war
inevitably
nourishes
anarchical
tendencies
within
the
workingmen
movement
with
the
disorganization
of
industries
of
national
finances
of
the
transportation
and
provisioning
systems
prolonged
civil
strife
thus
sets
up
tremendous
difficulties
in
the
way
of
constructive
organizing
work
nevertheless
the
soviet
government
can
look
the
future
in
the
face
with
perfect
confidence
only
a
careful
inventory
of
all
the
country
resources
only
a
rational
organization
of
industries
an
organization
born
of
one
general
plan
only
wise
and
careful
distribution
of
all
the
products
can
save
the
country
and
this
is
socialism
either
a
complete
descent
to
colonial
status
or
a
socialist
resurrection
these
are
the
alternatives
before
which
our
country
finds
itself
the
war
has
undermined
the
soil
of
the
entire
capitalistic
world
herein
lies
our
unconquerable
strength
the
imperialistic
ring
that
is
pressing
around
us
will
lie
burst
asunder
by
the
proletarian
revolution
we
do
not
doubt
this
for
a
minute
any
more
than
we
doubted
during
our
decades
of
underground
struggle
the
inevitableness
of
the
downfall
of
czarism
to
struggle
to
unite
our
forces
to
establish
industrial
discipline
and
a
socialist
regime
to
increase
the
productivity
of
labor
and
to
press
on
in
the
face
of
all
obstacles
this
is
our
mission
history
is
working
in
our
favor
the
proletarian
revolution
will
flare
up
sooner
or
later
both
in
europe
and
america
and
will
bring
emancipation
not
only
to
the
ukraine
poland
lithuania
courland
and
finland
but
also
to
all
suffering
humanity
