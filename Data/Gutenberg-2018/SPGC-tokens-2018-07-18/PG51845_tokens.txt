banker
of
wheeling
west
virginia
a
citizen
woke
gently
from
a
citizen
dreamless
sleep
it
was
the
time
the
time
proper
to
a
day
of
exceptional
opportunity
to
appreciate
citizen
germyn
dressed
himself
in
the
clothes
proper
for
the
appreciation
of
great
works
such
as
viewing
the
empire
state
ruins
against
storm
clouds
from
a
small
boat
or
walking
in
silent
single
file
across
the
remaining
course
of
the
golden
gate
bridge
or
as
today
one
hoped
witnessing
the
of
the
sun
germyn
with
difficulty
retained
a
citizen
necessary
calm
one
was
tempted
to
meditate
on
improper
things
would
the
sun
be
what
if
it
were
not
he
put
his
mind
to
his
dress
first
of
all
he
put
on
an
old
and
storied
bracelet
a
veritable
identity
bracelet
of
heavy
silver
links
and
a
plate
which
was
inscribed
pfc
joe
hartmann
his
fellow
would
have
envied
him
that
bracelet
if
they
had
been
capable
of
such
an
emotion
as
envy
no
other
id
bracelet
as
much
as
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
old
was
known
to
exist
in
wheeling
his
finest
shirt
and
pair
of
light
pants
went
next
to
his
skin
and
over
them
he
wore
a
loose
parka
whose
seams
had
been
carefully
weakened
when
the
sun
was
every
five
years
or
so
it
was
the
custom
to
remove
the
parka
gravely
and
rend
it
with
the
prescribed
graceful
gestures
but
not
so
drastically
that
it
could
not
be
stitched
together
again
hence
the
weakened
seams
this
was
he
counted
the
day
on
which
he
and
all
of
wheeling
had
donned
the
appropriate
sun
clothing
it
was
the
day
on
which
the
sun
no
longer
white
no
longer
blazing
yellow
no
longer
even
bright
red
had
risen
and
displayed
a
color
that
was
darker
maroon
and
always
darker
it
had
thought
citizen
germyn
never
grown
so
dark
and
so
cold
in
all
of
his
life
perhaps
it
was
an
occasion
for
special
viewing
for
surely
it
would
never
come
again
this
opportunity
to
see
the
old
sun
so
near
to
death
one
hoped
gravely
citizen
germyn
completed
his
dressing
thinking
only
of
the
act
of
dressing
itself
it
was
by
no
means
his
specialty
but
he
considered
when
it
was
done
that
he
had
done
it
well
in
the
traditional
flowing
gestures
with
no
flailing
at
all
times
balanced
lightly
on
the
ball
of
the
foot
it
was
all
the
more
perfectly
consummated
because
no
one
saw
it
but
himself
he
woke
his
wife
gently
by
placing
the
palm
of
his
hand
on
her
forehead
as
she
lay
neatly
in
the
prescribed
fashion
on
the
third
of
the
bed
the
warmth
of
his
hand
gradually
penetrated
the
layers
of
sleep
her
eyes
demurely
opened
citizeness
germyn
he
greeted
her
making
the
sign
with
his
left
hand
citizen
germyn
she
said
with
the
inclination
of
the
head
which
was
prescribed
when
the
hands
are
covered
he
retired
to
his
tiny
study
it
was
the
time
appropriate
to
meditation
on
the
properties
of
connectivity
citizen
germyn
was
skilled
in
meditation
even
for
a
banker
it
was
a
grace
in
which
he
had
schooled
himself
since
earliest
childhood
citizen
germyn
his
young
face
composed
his
slim
body
erect
as
he
sat
but
in
no
way
tense
or
straining
successfully
blanked
out
one
after
another
all
of
the
external
sounds
and
sights
and
feelings
that
interfered
with
proper
meditation
his
mind
was
very
nearly
vacant
except
of
one
central
problem
connectivity
over
his
head
and
behind
out
of
sight
the
cold
air
of
the
room
seemed
to
thicken
and
form
a
call
it
a
blob
a
blob
of
air
there
was
a
name
for
those
blobs
of
air
they
had
been
seen
before
they
were
a
known
fact
of
existence
in
wheeling
and
in
all
the
world
they
came
they
hovered
and
they
went
away
sometimes
not
alone
if
someone
had
been
in
the
room
with
citizen
germyn
to
look
at
it
he
would
have
seen
a
distortion
a
twisting
of
what
was
behind
the
blob
like
flawed
glass
a
lens
like
an
eye
and
they
were
called
eye
germyn
meditated
the
blob
of
air
grew
and
slowly
moved
a
vagrant
current
that
spun
out
from
it
caught
a
fragment
of
paper
and
whirled
it
to
the
floor
germyn
stirred
the
blob
retreated
germyn
all
unaware
disciplined
his
thoughts
to
disregard
the
interruption
to
return
to
the
central
problem
of
connectivity
the
blob
hovered
from
the
other
room
his
wife
small
signaled
to
him
that
she
was
dressed
germyn
got
up
to
go
to
her
his
mind
returning
to
the
world
and
the
overhead
eye
spun
relentlessly
and
disappeared
some
miles
east
of
wheeling
glenn
tropile
of
a
class
which
found
it
wisest
to
give
itself
no
special
name
and
which
had
devoted
much
time
and
thought
to
shaking
the
unwelcome
name
it
had
been
given
awoke
on
the
couch
of
his
apartment
he
sat
up
shivering
it
was
cold
the
damned
sun
was
still
bloody
dark
outside
the
window
and
the
apartment
was
soggy
and
chilled
he
had
kicked
off
the
blankets
in
his
sleep
he
learn
to
sleep
quietly
like
anybody
else
lacking
a
robe
he
clutched
the
blankets
around
him
got
up
and
walked
to
the
unglassed
window
it
was
not
unusual
for
glenn
tropile
to
wake
up
on
his
couch
this
happened
because
gala
tropile
had
a
temper
was
inclined
to
exile
him
from
her
bed
after
a
quarrel
and
the
operative
factor
he
knew
he
always
had
the
advantage
over
her
for
the
whole
day
following
the
night
exile
therefore
the
quarrel
was
worth
it
an
advantage
was
by
definition
worth
anything
you
paid
for
it
or
else
it
was
no
advantage
he
could
hear
her
moving
about
in
one
of
the
other
rooms
and
cocked
an
ear
satisfied
she
had
waked
him
therefore
she
was
about
to
make
amends
a
little
itch
in
his
spine
or
his
brain
it
was
not
a
physical
itch
so
he
could
locate
it
he
could
only
be
sure
that
it
was
there
stopped
troubling
him
momentarily
he
was
winning
a
contest
it
was
glenn
tropile
nature
to
win
contests
and
his
nature
to
create
them
gala
tropile
young
dark
attractive
with
a
haunted
look
came
in
tentatively
carrying
coffee
from
some
secret
hoard
of
hers
glenn
tropile
affected
not
to
notice
he
stared
coldly
out
at
the
cold
landscape
the
sea
white
with
thin
ice
was
nearly
out
of
sight
so
far
had
it
retreated
as
the
little
sun
waned
glenn
ah
good
where
was
the
proper
mode
of
where
was
the
prescribed
upon
entering
a
room
assiduously
he
had
untaught
her
the
meticulous
ritual
of
manners
that
they
had
all
of
them
been
brought
up
to
know
and
it
was
the
greatest
of
his
many
victories
over
her
that
sometimes
now
was
the
aggressor
would
be
the
first
to
depart
from
the
formal
behavior
prescribed
for
citizens
depravity
perversion
sometimes
they
would
touch
each
other
at
times
which
were
not
the
appropriate
times
gala
sitting
on
her
husband
lap
in
the
late
evening
perhaps
or
tropile
kissing
her
awake
in
the
morning
sometimes
he
would
force
her
to
let
him
watch
her
dress
no
not
now
for
the
cold
of
the
waning
sun
made
that
sort
of
frolic
unattractive
but
she
had
permitted
it
before
and
such
was
his
mastery
over
her
that
he
knew
she
would
permit
it
again
when
the
sun
was
if
a
thought
came
to
him
the
sun
was
he
turned
away
from
the
cold
outside
and
looked
at
his
wife
good
morning
darling
she
was
contrite
he
demanded
jarringly
is
it
deliberately
he
stretched
deliberately
he
yawned
deliberately
he
scratched
his
chest
every
movement
was
ugly
gala
tropile
quivered
but
said
nothing
tropile
flung
himself
on
the
better
of
the
two
chairs
one
hairy
leg
protruding
from
under
the
wrapped
blankets
his
wife
was
on
her
best
behavior
in
his
unique
terms
she
did
avert
her
eyes
what
you
got
there
he
asked
coffee
yes
dear
i
thought
where
you
get
it
the
haunted
eyes
looked
away
still
better
thought
glenn
tropile
more
satisfied
even
than
usual
she
been
ransacking
an
old
warehouse
again
it
was
a
trick
he
had
taught
her
and
like
all
of
the
illicit
tricks
she
had
learned
from
him
a
handy
weapon
when
he
chose
to
use
it
it
was
not
prescribed
that
a
citizen
should
rummage
through
old
places
a
citizen
did
his
work
whatever
that
work
might
be
banker
baker
or
furniture
repairman
he
received
what
rewards
were
his
due
for
the
work
he
did
a
citizen
took
anything
that
was
not
his
due
not
even
if
it
lay
abandoned
and
rotting
it
was
one
of
the
differences
between
glenn
tropile
and
the
people
he
moved
among
i
got
it
made
he
exulted
it
was
what
i
needed
to
clinch
my
victory
over
her
he
spoke
i
need
you
more
than
i
need
coffee
gala
she
looked
up
troubled
what
would
i
do
he
demanded
if
a
beam
fell
on
you
one
day
while
you
were
scrambling
through
the
fancy
groceries
how
can
you
take
such
chances
do
you
what
you
mean
to
me
she
sniffed
a
couple
of
times
she
said
brokenly
darling
about
last
night
i
sorry
and
miserably
held
out
the
cup
he
took
it
and
set
it
down
he
took
her
hand
looked
up
at
her
and
kissed
it
lingeringly
he
felt
her
tremble
then
she
gave
him
a
wild
adoring
look
and
flung
herself
into
his
arms
a
new
dominance
cycle
was
begun
at
the
moment
he
returned
her
frantic
kisses
glenn
knew
and
gala
knew
that
he
had
over
her
an
edge
an
advantage
the
weather
gauge
initiative
of
fire
percentage
the
lack
of
tension
call
it
anything
but
it
was
life
itself
to
such
as
glenn
tropile
he
knew
and
she
knew
that
having
the
advantage
he
would
press
it
and
she
would
yield
on
and
on
in
a
rising
spiral
he
did
it
because
it
was
his
life
the
attaining
of
an
advantage
over
anyone
he
might
encounter
because
he
was
unwelcomely
but
justly
called
a
son
of
the
wolf
a
world
away
a
pyramid
squatted
sullenly
on
the
top
of
the
highest
peak
of
the
himalayas
it
had
not
been
built
there
it
had
not
been
carried
there
by
man
or
man
machines
it
had
come
in
its
own
time
for
its
own
reasons
did
it
wake
on
that
day
the
thing
atop
mount
everest
or
did
it
ever
sleep
nobody
knew
it
stood
or
sat
there
approximately
a
tetrahedron
its
appearance
was
known
constructed
on
a
base
line
of
some
yards
slaggy
in
color
almost
nothing
else
about
it
was
known
at
least
to
mankind
it
was
the
only
one
of
its
kind
on
earth
though
men
thought
without
much
sure
knowledge
that
there
were
more
perhaps
many
thousands
more
like
it
on
the
unfamiliar
planet
that
was
earth
binary
swinging
around
the
miniature
sun
that
hung
at
their
common
center
of
gravity
like
an
unbalanced
dumbbell
but
men
knew
very
little
about
that
planet
itself
only
that
it
had
come
out
of
space
and
was
now
there
time
was
when
men
had
tried
to
label
that
binary
more
than
two
centuries
before
when
it
had
first
appeared
runaway
planet
the
invader
rejoice
in
messias
the
day
is
at
hand
the
labels
were
they
were
xs
in
an
equation
signifying
only
that
there
was
there
which
was
unknown
the
runaway
planet
stopped
running
when
it
closed
on
earth
the
invader
did
invade
it
merely
sent
down
one
slaggy
tetrahedron
to
everest
and
rejoice
in
messias
stole
earth
from
its
sun
with
earth
old
moon
which
it
converted
into
a
miniature
sun
of
its
own
that
was
the
time
when
men
were
plentiful
and
strong
or
thought
they
were
with
many
huge
cities
and
countless
powerful
machines
it
matter
the
new
binary
planet
showed
no
interest
in
the
cities
or
the
machines
there
was
a
plague
of
things
like
eyes
without
dust
motionless
air
that
suddenly
tensed
and
quivered
into
lenticular
shapes
they
came
with
the
planet
and
the
pyramid
so
that
there
probably
was
some
connection
but
there
was
nothing
to
do
about
the
eyes
striking
at
them
was
like
striking
at
air
was
the
same
thing
in
fact
while
the
men
and
machines
tried
uselessly
to
do
something
about
it
the
new
binary
system
the
stranger
planet
and
earth
began
to
move
accelerating
very
slowly
but
accelerating
in
a
week
astronomers
knew
something
was
happening
in
a
month
the
moon
sprang
into
flame
and
became
a
new
sun
beginning
to
be
needed
for
already
the
parent
sol
was
visibly
more
distant
and
in
a
few
years
it
was
only
one
other
star
among
many
when
the
little
sun
was
burned
to
a
clinker
they
whoever
they
were
for
men
saw
only
the
one
pyramid
would
hang
a
new
one
in
the
sky
it
happened
every
five
more
or
less
it
was
the
same
old
but
it
burned
out
and
the
fires
needed
to
be
rekindled
the
first
of
these
suns
had
looked
down
on
an
earthly
population
of
ten
billion
as
the
sequence
of
suns
waxed
and
waned
there
were
changes
climatic
fluctuation
all
but
immeasurable
differences
in
the
quantity
and
kind
of
radiation
from
the
new
source
the
changes
were
such
that
the
such
sun
looked
down
on
a
shrinking
human
race
that
could
not
muster
up
a
hundred
million
a
frustrated
man
drives
inward
it
is
the
same
with
a
race
the
hundred
million
that
clung
to
existence
were
not
the
same
as
the
bold
vital
ten
billion
the
thing
on
everest
had
in
its
time
received
many
labels
too
the
devil
the
friend
the
beast
a
entity
of
quite
unknown
electrochemical
properties
all
these
labels
were
also
xs
if
it
did
wake
that
morning
it
did
not
open
its
eyes
for
it
had
no
eyes
apart
from
the
quivers
of
air
that
might
or
might
not
belong
to
it
eyes
might
have
been
gouged
therefore
it
had
none
so
an
illogical
person
might
have
argued
and
yet
it
was
tempting
to
apply
the
purpose
not
function
fallacy
to
it
limbs
could
be
crushed
it
had
no
limbs
ears
could
be
deafened
it
had
none
through
a
mouth
it
might
be
poisoned
it
had
no
mouth
intentions
and
actions
could
be
frustrated
apparently
it
had
neither
it
was
there
that
was
all
it
and
others
like
it
had
stolen
the
earth
and
the
earth
did
not
know
why
it
was
there
and
the
one
thing
on
earth
you
could
not
do
was
hurt
it
influence
it
or
coerce
it
in
any
way
whatever
it
was
there
and
it
or
the
masters
it
represented
owned
the
earth
by
right
of
theft
utterly
beyond
human
hope
of
challenge
or
redress
ii
citizen
and
citizeness
roget
germyn
walked
down
pine
street
in
the
chill
and
dusk
of
one
hoped
a
sun
morning
it
was
the
convention
to
pretend
that
this
was
a
morning
like
any
other
morning
it
was
not
proper
either
to
cast
frequent
hopeful
glances
at
the
sky
nor
yet
to
seem
disturbed
or
afraid
because
this
was
after
all
the
such
morning
since
those
whose
specialty
was
sky
viewing
had
come
to
believe
the
of
the
sun
was
near
the
citizen
and
his
citizeness
exchanged
the
sign
with
a
few
old
friends
and
stopped
to
converse
this
also
was
a
convention
of
skill
divorced
from
purpose
the
conversation
was
without
relevance
to
anything
that
any
one
of
the
participants
might
know
or
think
or
wish
to
ask
germyn
said
for
his
friends
a
poem
he
had
made
in
honor
of
the
occasion
and
heard
their
responses
they
did
for
a
while
until
somebody
indicated
unhappiness
and
a
wish
to
change
by
frowning
the
two
grooves
between
his
brows
the
game
was
deftly
ended
with
an
improvised
rhymed
exchange
casually
citizen
germyn
glanced
aloft
the
had
not
begun
yet
the
dying
old
sun
hung
just
over
the
horizon
east
and
south
much
more
south
than
east
it
was
an
ugly
thought
but
suppose
thought
germyn
just
that
the
sun
were
not
today
or
tomorrow
or
or
ever
the
citizen
got
a
grip
on
himself
and
told
his
wife
we
shall
dine
at
the
oatmeal
stall
the
citizeness
did
not
immediately
reply
when
germyn
glanced
at
her
with
surprise
he
found
her
almost
staring
down
the
dim
street
at
a
citizen
who
moved
almost
in
a
stride
almost
swinging
his
arms
scarcely
graceful
that
might
be
more
wolf
than
man
she
said
doubtfully
germyn
knew
the
fellow
tropile
was
his
name
one
of
those
curious
few
who
made
their
homes
outside
of
wheeling
though
they
were
not
farmers
germyn
had
had
banking
dealings
with
him
or
would
have
had
if
it
had
been
up
to
tropile
that
is
a
careless
man
he
decided
and
an
one
they
moved
toward
the
oatmeal
stall
with
the
gait
of
citizens
arms
limp
feet
scarcely
lifted
slumped
forward
a
little
it
was
the
ancient
gait
of
fifteen
hundred
calories
per
day
not
one
of
which
could
be
squandered
there
was
a
need
for
more
calories
so
many
for
walking
so
many
for
gathering
food
so
many
for
the
economical
pleasures
of
the
citizens
so
many
more
oh
many
more
these
days
to
keep
out
the
cold
yet
there
were
no
more
calories
the
diet
the
whole
world
lived
on
was
a
bare
subsistence
diet
it
was
impossible
to
farm
well
when
half
the
world
land
was
part
of
the
time
drowned
in
the
rising
sea
part
of
the
time
smothered
in
falling
snow
citizens
knew
this
and
knowing
did
not
struggle
it
was
ungraceful
to
struggle
particularly
when
one
could
not
win
only
well
wolves
struggled
wasting
calories
lacking
grace
citizen
germyn
turned
his
mind
to
more
pleasant
things
he
allowed
himself
his
first
foretaste
of
the
oatmeal
it
would
be
warm
in
the
bowl
hot
in
the
throat
a
comfort
in
the
belly
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
there
in
weather
like
this
when
the
cold
plucked
through
the
loosened
seams
and
the
wind
came
up
the
sides
of
the
hills
not
that
there
was
pleasure
in
the
cold
itself
for
that
matter
it
was
proper
that
one
should
be
cold
now
just
before
the
of
the
sun
when
the
old
sun
was
and
the
new
one
not
yet
still
looks
like
wolf
to
me
his
wife
was
muttering
cadence
germyn
reproved
his
citizeness
but
took
the
sting
out
of
it
with
a
quirked
smile
the
man
with
the
ugly
manners
was
standing
at
the
very
bar
of
the
oatmeal
stall
where
they
were
heading
in
the
gloom
of
he
was
all
angles
and
strained
lines
his
head
was
turned
awkwardly
on
his
shoulder
peering
toward
the
back
of
the
stall
where
the
vendor
was
rhythmically
measuring
grain
into
a
pot
his
hands
were
resting
on
the
counter
not
hanging
by
his
sides
citizen
germyn
felt
a
faint
shudder
from
his
wife
but
he
did
not
reprove
her
again
for
who
could
blame
her
the
exhibition
was
revolting
she
said
faintly
citizen
might
we
dine
on
bread
this
morning
he
hesitated
and
glanced
again
at
the
ugly
man
he
said
indulgently
knowing
that
he
was
indulgent
on
sun
morning
the
citizeness
may
dine
on
bread
bearing
in
mind
the
occasion
it
was
only
a
small
favor
and
therefore
a
very
proper
one
the
bread
was
good
very
good
they
shared
out
the
between
them
and
ate
it
in
silence
as
it
deserved
germyn
finished
his
first
portion
and
in
the
prescribed
pause
before
beginning
his
second
elected
to
refresh
his
eyes
upward
he
nodded
to
his
wife
and
stepped
outside
overhead
the
old
sun
parceled
out
its
last
of
heat
it
was
larger
than
the
stars
around
it
but
many
of
them
were
nearly
as
bright
a
male
voice
said
citizen
germyn
good
morning
germyn
was
caught
off
balance
he
took
his
eyes
off
the
sky
half
turned
glanced
at
the
face
of
the
person
who
had
spoken
to
him
raised
his
hand
in
the
sign
it
was
all
very
quick
and
fluid
almost
too
quick
for
he
had
had
his
fingers
bent
nearly
into
the
sign
for
female
friends
and
this
was
a
man
citizen
boyne
germyn
knew
him
well
they
had
shared
the
ice
viewing
at
niagara
a
year
before
germyn
recovered
quickly
enough
but
it
had
been
disconcerting
he
improvised
swiftly
there
are
stars
but
are
stars
still
there
if
there
is
no
sun
it
was
a
hurried
effort
he
grieved
but
no
doubt
boyne
would
pick
it
up
and
carry
it
along
boyne
had
always
been
very
good
very
graceful
boyne
did
no
such
thing
good
morning
he
said
again
faintly
he
glanced
at
the
stars
overhead
as
though
trying
to
unravel
what
germyn
was
talking
about
he
said
accusingly
his
voice
cracking
sharply
there
is
any
sun
germyn
what
do
you
think
of
that
germyn
swallowed
citizen
perhaps
you
no
sun
you
hear
me
the
man
sobbed
it
cold
germyn
the
pyramids
are
going
to
give
us
another
sun
do
you
know
that
they
going
to
starve
us
freeze
us
they
through
with
us
we
done
all
of
us
he
was
nearly
screaming
all
up
and
down
pine
street
people
were
trying
not
to
look
at
him
and
some
of
them
were
failing
boyne
clutched
at
germyn
helplessly
revolted
germyn
drew
back
contact
it
seemed
to
bring
the
man
to
his
senses
reason
returned
to
his
eyes
he
said
i
he
stopped
stared
about
him
i
think
i
have
bread
for
breakfast
he
said
foolishly
and
plunged
into
the
stall
boyne
left
behind
him
a
shaken
citizen
caught
halfway
into
the
of
parting
staring
after
him
with
jaw
slack
and
eyes
wide
as
though
germyn
had
no
manners
either
all
this
on
sun
day
what
could
it
mean
germyn
wondered
fretfully
worriedly
was
boyne
on
the
point
of
could
boyne
be
about
to
germyn
drew
back
from
the
thought
there
was
one
thing
that
might
explain
boyne
behavior
but
it
was
not
a
proper
speculation
for
one
citizen
to
make
about
another
all
the
same
germyn
dared
the
thought
all
the
same
it
seem
almost
as
though
citizen
boyne
were
on
the
point
of
well
running
amok
at
the
oatmeal
stall
glenn
tropile
thumped
on
the
counter
the
laggard
oatmeal
vendor
finally
brought
the
ritual
bowl
of
salt
and
the
pitcher
of
thin
milk
tropile
took
his
paper
twist
of
salt
from
the
top
of
the
neatly
arranged
pile
in
the
bowl
he
glanced
at
the
vendor
his
fingers
hesitated
then
quickly
he
ripped
the
twist
of
paper
into
his
oatmeal
and
covered
it
to
the
permitted
level
with
the
milk
he
ate
quickly
and
efficiently
watching
the
street
outside
they
were
wandering
and
mooning
about
as
always
maybe
today
more
than
most
days
since
they
hoped
it
would
be
the
day
the
sun
blossomed
flame
once
more
tropile
always
thought
of
the
wandering
mooning
citizens
as
there
was
a
somewhere
for
tropile
no
doubt
but
tropile
had
not
as
yet
located
it
not
even
in
the
bonds
of
the
marriage
contract
he
was
in
no
hurry
at
the
age
of
fourteen
glenn
tropile
had
reluctantly
come
to
realize
certain
things
about
himself
that
he
disliked
being
bested
that
he
had
to
have
a
certain
advantage
in
all
his
dealings
or
an
intolerable
itch
of
the
mind
drove
him
to
discomfort
the
things
added
up
to
a
terrifying
fear
gradually
becoming
knowledge
that
the
only
we
that
could
properly
include
him
was
one
that
it
was
not
very
wise
to
join
he
had
realized
in
fact
that
he
was
a
wolf
for
some
years
tropile
had
struggled
against
it
for
wolf
was
an
obscene
word
the
children
he
played
with
were
punished
severely
for
saying
it
and
for
almost
nothing
else
it
was
not
for
one
citizen
to
advantage
himself
at
the
expense
of
another
wolves
did
that
it
was
for
a
citizen
to
accept
what
he
had
not
to
strive
for
more
to
find
beauty
in
small
things
to
accommodate
himself
with
the
minimum
of
strain
and
awkwardness
to
whatever
his
life
happened
to
be
wolves
were
not
like
that
wolves
never
meditated
wolves
never
appreciated
wolves
were
translated
that
supreme
fulfillment
granted
only
to
those
who
succeeded
in
a
perfect
meditation
that
surrender
of
the
world
and
the
flesh
by
taking
leave
of
both
which
could
never
be
achieved
by
a
wolf
accordingly
glenn
tropile
had
tried
very
hard
to
do
all
the
things
that
wolves
could
not
do
he
had
nearly
succeeded
his
specialty
water
watching
had
been
most
rewarding
he
had
achieved
many
partly
successful
meditations
on
connectivity
and
yet
he
was
still
a
wolf
for
he
still
felt
that
burning
itching
urge
to
triumph
and
to
hold
an
advantage
for
that
reason
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
make
friends
among
the
citizens
and
gradually
he
had
almost
stopped
trying
tropile
had
arrived
in
wheeling
nearly
a
year
before
making
him
one
of
the
early
settlers
in
point
of
time
and
yet
there
was
not
a
citizen
in
the
street
who
was
prepared
to
exchange
recognition
gestures
with
him
knew
nearly
every
one
he
knew
their
names
and
their
wives
names
he
knew
what
northern
states
they
had
moved
down
from
with
the
spreading
of
the
ice
as
the
sun
grew
dim
he
knew
very
nearly
to
the
quarter
of
a
gram
what
stores
of
sugar
and
salt
and
coffee
each
one
of
them
had
put
away
for
their
guests
of
course
not
for
themselves
the
citizen
hoarded
only
for
the
entertainment
of
others
tropile
knew
these
things
because
there
was
an
advantage
in
knowing
them
but
there
was
no
advantage
in
having
anyone
know
him
a
few
did
that
banker
germyn
tropile
had
approached
him
only
a
few
months
before
about
a
prospective
loan
but
it
had
been
a
chancy
nervous
encounter
the
idea
was
so
luminously
simple
to
tropile
organize
an
expedition
to
the
coal
mines
that
once
had
flourished
nearby
find
the
coal
bring
it
to
wheeling
heat
the
houses
and
yet
it
had
seemed
blasphemous
to
germyn
tropile
had
counted
himself
lucky
merely
to
have
been
refused
the
loan
instead
of
being
cried
out
upon
as
wolf
the
oatmeal
vendor
was
fussing
worriedly
around
his
neat
stack
of
paper
twists
in
the
salt
bowl
tropile
avoided
the
man
eyes
tropile
was
not
interested
in
the
little
wry
smile
of
which
the
vendor
would
make
to
him
given
half
a
chance
tropile
knew
well
enough
what
was
disturbing
the
vendor
let
it
disturb
him
it
was
tropile
custom
to
take
extra
twists
of
salt
they
were
in
his
pockets
now
they
would
stay
there
let
the
vendor
wonder
why
he
was
short
tropile
licked
the
bowl
of
his
spoon
and
stepped
into
the
street
he
was
comfortably
aware
under
a
parka
that
the
wind
was
blowing
very
cold
a
citizen
passed
him
walking
alone
odd
thought
tropile
he
was
walking
rapidly
and
there
was
a
look
of
taut
despair
on
his
face
still
more
odd
odd
enough
to
be
worth
another
look
because
that
sort
of
haste
that
sort
of
abstraction
suggested
something
to
tropile
they
were
in
no
way
normal
to
the
gentle
sheep
of
the
class
except
in
one
particular
circumstance
glenn
tropile
crossed
the
street
to
follow
the
abstracted
citizen
whose
name
he
knew
was
boyne
the
man
blundered
into
citizen
germyn
outside
the
baker
stall
and
tropile
stood
back
out
of
easy
sight
watching
and
listening
boyne
was
on
the
ragged
edge
of
breakdown
what
tropile
heard
and
saw
confirmed
his
diagnosis
the
one
particular
circumstance
was
close
to
happening
citizen
boyne
was
on
the
verge
of
running
amok
tropile
looked
at
the
man
with
amusement
and
contempt
amok
the
gentle
sheep
be
pushed
too
far
he
had
seen
citizens
run
amok
the
signs
were
obvious
there
was
pretty
sure
to
be
an
advantage
in
it
for
glenn
tropile
there
was
an
advantage
in
almost
anything
if
you
looked
for
it
he
watched
and
waited
he
picked
his
spot
with
care
so
that
he
could
see
citizen
boyne
inside
the
baker
stall
making
a
dismal
botch
of
slashing
his
of
bread
from
the
morning
loaf
he
waited
for
boyne
to
come
racing
out
boyne
did
a
yell
loud
piercing
it
was
citizen
germyn
shrilling
amok
amok
a
scream
an
enraged
wordless
cry
from
boyne
and
the
baker
knife
glinting
in
the
faint
light
as
boyne
swung
it
and
then
citizens
were
scattering
in
every
direction
all
of
the
citizens
but
one
one
citizen
was
under
the
knife
his
own
knife
as
it
happened
it
was
the
baker
himself
boyne
chopped
and
chopped
again
and
then
boyne
came
out
roaring
the
broad
knife
whistling
about
his
head
the
gentle
citizens
fled
panicked
before
him
he
struck
at
their
retreating
forms
and
screamed
and
struck
again
amok
it
was
the
one
particular
circumstance
when
they
forgot
to
be
gracious
one
of
the
two
tropile
corrected
himself
as
he
strolled
across
to
the
baker
stall
his
brow
furrowed
because
there
was
another
circumstance
when
they
lacked
grace
and
one
which
affected
him
nearly
he
watched
the
maddened
creature
boyne
already
far
down
the
road
chasing
a
knot
of
citizens
around
a
corner
tropile
sighed
and
stepped
into
the
baker
stall
to
see
what
he
might
gain
from
this
boyne
would
wear
himself
out
the
surging
rage
would
leave
him
as
quickly
as
it
came
he
would
be
a
sheep
again
and
the
other
sheep
would
close
in
and
capture
him
that
was
what
happened
when
a
citizen
ran
amok
it
was
a
measure
of
what
pressures
were
on
the
citizens
that
at
any
moment
there
might
be
one
gram
of
pressure
too
much
and
one
of
them
would
crack
it
had
happened
here
in
wheeling
twice
within
the
past
two
months
glenn
tropile
had
seen
it
happen
in
pittsburgh
altoona
and
bronxville
there
is
a
limit
to
the
pressure
that
can
be
endured
tropile
walked
into
the
baker
stall
and
looked
down
without
emotion
at
the
slaughtered
baker
the
corpse
was
a
gory
mess
but
tropile
had
seen
corpses
before
he
looked
around
the
stall
calculating
as
a
starter
he
bent
to
pick
up
the
of
bread
boyne
had
dropped
dusted
it
off
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
food
was
always
useful
given
enough
food
perhaps
boyne
would
not
have
run
amok
was
it
simple
hunger
they
cracked
under
or
the
knowledge
of
the
thing
on
mount
everest
or
the
hovering
eyes
or
the
prospect
of
translation
or
merely
the
strain
of
keeping
up
their
laboriously
figured
lives
did
it
matter
cracked
and
ran
amok
and
tropile
never
would
and
that
was
what
mattered
he
leaned
across
the
counter
reaching
for
what
was
left
of
the
morning
loaf
and
found
himself
staring
into
the
terrified
large
eyes
of
citizeness
germyn
she
screamed
wolf
citizens
help
me
wolf
tropile
faltered
he
had
even
the
damned
woman
but
there
she
was
rising
up
from
behind
the
counter
screaming
her
head
off
wolf
wolf
he
said
sharply
citizeness
i
beg
you
but
that
was
no
good
the
evidence
was
on
him
and
her
screams
would
fetch
others
tropile
panicked
he
started
toward
her
to
silence
her
but
that
was
no
good
either
he
whirled
she
was
screaming
screaming
and
there
were
people
to
hear
tropile
darted
into
the
street
but
they
were
popping
out
of
every
doorway
now
appearing
from
each
rat
hole
in
which
they
had
hid
to
escape
boyne
please
he
cried
sobbing
wait
a
minute
but
they
were
waiting
they
had
heard
the
woman
and
maybe
some
of
them
had
seen
him
with
the
bread
they
were
all
around
him
no
they
were
all
over
him
they
were
clutching
at
him
tearing
at
his
soft
warm
furs
they
pulled
at
his
pockets
and
the
stolen
twists
of
salt
spilled
accusingly
out
they
yanked
at
his
sleeves
and
even
the
stout
unweakened
seams
ripped
open
he
was
fairly
captured
wolf
they
were
shouting
wolf
it
drowned
out
the
distant
noise
from
where
boyne
had
finally
been
run
to
earth
a
block
and
more
away
it
drowned
out
everything
it
was
the
other
circumstance
when
forgot
to
be
gracious
when
they
had
trapped
a
son
of
the
wolf
iii
engineering
had
long
ago
come
to
an
end
engineering
is
possible
under
one
condition
of
the
equation
total
available
calories
divided
by
population
equals
style
when
the
ratio
is
large
say
five
thousand
or
more
five
thousand
daily
calories
for
every
living
person
then
the
style
is
people
carve
mount
rushmore
they
build
great
foundries
they
manufacture
enormous
automobiles
to
carry
one
housewife
half
a
mile
for
the
purchase
of
one
lipstick
life
is
coarse
and
rich
where
c
p
is
large
at
the
other
extreme
where
c
p
is
too
small
life
does
not
exist
at
all
it
has
starved
out
experimentally
add
little
increments
to
c
p
and
it
will
be
some
time
before
the
side
of
the
equation
becomes
significant
but
at
last
in
the
to
calorie
range
style
firmly
appears
in
form
c
p
in
that
range
produces
the
small
arts
the
appreciations
the
peaceful
arrangements
of
necessities
into
subtle
relationships
of
traditionally
virtue
think
of
japan
locked
into
its
shogunate
prison
with
a
hungry
population
scrabbling
food
out
of
mountainsides
and
beauty
out
of
arrangements
of
lichens
the
small
inexpensive
are
characteristic
of
the
to
calorie
range
and
this
was
the
range
of
earth
the
world
of
ten
billion
men
when
the
planet
was
stolen
by
its
new
binary
some
few
persons
inexpensively
studied
the
study
of
science
with
pencil
and
renewable
paper
but
the
last
research
accelerator
had
long
since
been
shut
down
the
juice
from
its
dam
was
needed
to
supply
meager
light
to
a
million
homes
and
to
cook
the
pablum
for
two
million
babies
in
those
days
one
dedicated
byzantine
wrote
the
definitive
encyclopedia
of
engineering
though
he
was
no
engineer
its
four
hundred
and
twenty
tiny
volumes
examined
exhaustively
the
engineering
feats
of
ancient
greece
and
egypt
the
wall
of
ti
the
gothic
builders
brunel
who
changed
the
face
of
england
the
roeblings
of
brooklyn
groves
of
the
pentagon
duggan
of
the
shelter
system
before
c
p
dropped
to
the
point
where
war
became
vanishingly
implausible
levern
of
operation
up
but
the
encyclopedist
could
not
use
a
slide
rule
without
thinking
faltering
jotting
down
his
decimals
and
then
the
magnitudes
grew
less
under
the
tectonic
and
climatic
battering
of
the
great
abduction
of
earth
from
its
primary
under
the
advances
to
and
retreats
from
the
equator
of
the
ice
sheath
as
the
small
successor
suns
waxed
waned
died
and
were
replaced
the
ratio
c
p
remained
stable
c
had
diminished
enormously
so
had
as
the
calories
to
support
life
grew
scarce
so
the
consuming
mouths
of
mankind
grew
less
in
number
the
small
sun
shone
on
no
engineers
not
even
on
the
binary
perhaps
the
pyramids
the
things
on
the
binary
the
thing
on
mount
everest
they
were
not
engineers
they
employed
a
crude
metaphysic
based
on
dissection
and
shoving
they
had
no
elegant
field
theories
all
they
knew
was
that
everything
came
apart
and
that
if
you
pushed
a
thing
it
would
move
if
your
biggest
push
would
not
move
a
thing
you
took
it
apart
and
pushed
the
parts
and
then
it
would
move
sometimes
for
nuclear
effects
they
had
to
take
things
apart
into
pieces
and
shove
each
piece
very
carefully
by
taking
apart
and
shoving
then
they
landed
their
one
spaceship
on
the
sunlet
four
human
beings
were
on
that
ship
they
meditated
briefly
on
connectivity
and
died
screaming
a
point
of
new
flame
appeared
on
the
sunlet
surface
and
the
spaceship
scrambled
for
the
binary
the
point
of
flame
went
from
cherry
through
orange
into
the
and
began
to
spread
at
the
moment
of
the
of
the
sun
there
was
rejoicing
on
the
earth
not
quite
everywhere
though
in
wheeling
house
of
the
five
regulations
glenn
tropile
waited
unquietly
for
death
citizen
boyne
who
had
run
amok
and
slaughtered
the
baker
shared
tropile
room
and
his
doom
but
not
his
rage
boyne
with
demure
pleasure
was
composing
his
death
poem
talk
to
me
snapped
tropile
why
are
we
here
what
did
you
do
and
why
did
you
do
it
what
have
i
done
why
do
i
pick
up
a
bench
and
kill
you
with
it
you
would
killed
me
two
hours
ago
if
i
caught
your
eye
there
was
no
satisfaction
in
citizen
boyne
the
passions
were
burned
out
of
him
he
politely
tendered
tropile
a
famous
aphorism
citizen
the
art
of
living
is
the
substitution
of
unimportant
answerable
questions
for
important
unanswerable
ones
come
let
us
appreciate
the
sun
he
turned
to
the
window
where
the
spark
of
flame
in
what
had
once
been
the
crater
of
tycho
was
beginning
to
spread
across
the
charred
moon
tropile
was
child
enough
of
his
culture
to
turn
with
him
almost
involuntarily
he
was
silent
that
infinitesimal
up
there
growing
slowly
the
oneness
the
calm
rapture
of
being
in
a
universe
that
you
shaded
into
without
harsh
discontinua
the
being
one
with
the
great
blossoming
now
in
the
heavens
that
were
no
different
stuff
than
you
yourself
he
closed
his
eyes
calm
and
meditated
on
connectivity
he
was
being
good
by
the
time
the
fusion
reaction
had
covered
the
whole
small
disk
of
the
sunlet
a
at
the
most
his
meditation
began
to
wear
off
tropile
shrugged
out
of
his
torn
parka
not
bothering
to
rip
it
further
it
was
already
growing
warm
in
the
room
citizen
boyne
of
course
was
carefully
opening
every
seam
with
graceful
rending
motions
miming
great
and
smooth
effort
of
the
biceps
and
trapezius
but
the
meditation
was
over
and
as
tropile
watched
his
cellmate
he
screamed
a
silent
since
his
adolescence
that
wailing
syllable
had
seldom
been
far
from
his
mind
it
could
be
silenced
by
appreciation
and
meditation
tropile
specialty
was
water
watching
and
he
was
so
good
at
it
that
several
beginners
had
asked
him
for
instruction
in
the
subtle
art
in
spite
of
his
notorious
oddities
of
life
and
manner
he
water
watching
he
almost
pitied
anybody
so
devoted
to
say
clouds
and
odors
great
game
though
it
was
that
he
had
never
even
tried
water
watching
and
after
a
session
of
watching
when
one
was
lucky
enough
to
observe
the
nine
boiling
stages
in
classic
perfection
one
might
slip
into
meditation
and
be
harmonious
feel
good
but
what
did
one
do
when
the
meditations
failed
as
they
had
failed
him
what
did
one
do
when
they
came
farther
and
farther
apart
became
less
and
less
intense
could
be
inspired
finally
only
by
a
huge
event
like
the
renewal
of
the
sun
one
went
amok
he
had
always
thought
but
he
had
not
boyne
had
he
had
been
declared
a
son
of
the
wolf
on
no
evidence
that
he
could
understand
yet
he
had
not
run
amok
still
the
penalties
were
the
same
he
thought
uncomfortably
aware
of
an
unfamiliar
itch
not
the
inward
intolerable
itch
of
needing
the
advantage
but
a
localized
sensation
at
the
base
of
his
spine
the
penalties
for
all
gross
crimes
wolfhood
or
running
amok
were
the
same
and
simply
this
they
would
perform
the
lumbar
puncture
he
would
make
the
donation
of
spinal
fluid
he
would
be
dead
the
keeper
of
the
house
of
five
regulations
an
old
man
citizen
harmane
looked
in
on
his
charges
approvingly
at
boyne
with
a
beclouded
expression
at
glenn
tropile
it
was
thought
that
even
wolves
were
entitled
to
the
common
human
decencies
in
the
brief
interval
between
exposure
and
the
donation
of
fluid
the
keeper
would
not
have
dreamed
of
scowling
at
the
detected
wolf
or
of
interfering
with
whatever
wretched
imitation
of
the
creature
might
practice
but
he
could
not
all
the
same
bring
himself
to
offer
even
an
gesture
tropile
had
no
such
qualms
he
scowled
at
keeper
harmane
with
such
ferocity
that
the
old
man
almost
hurried
away
he
turned
an
almost
equally
ugly
scowl
upon
citizen
boyne
how
dared
that
be
so
calm
so
relaxed
tropile
said
brutally
they
kill
us
you
know
that
they
stick
a
needle
in
our
spines
and
drain
us
dry
it
do
you
understand
me
they
going
to
drain
us
and
then
they
going
to
drink
our
spinal
fluid
and
it
going
to
he
was
gently
corrected
we
shall
make
the
donation
citizen
boyne
said
calmly
is
not
the
difference
intelligible
to
a
son
of
the
wolf
true
culture
demanded
that
that
remark
be
accepted
as
a
friendly
joke
probably
based
on
a
truth
how
else
could
an
unpalatable
truth
be
put
in
words
otherwise
the
unthinkable
might
happen
they
might
quarrel
they
might
even
come
to
blows
the
appropriate
mild
smile
formed
on
tropile
lips
but
harshly
he
wiped
it
off
they
were
going
to
him
he
would
smile
for
them
and
the
effort
was
enormous
i
a
son
of
the
wolf
he
howled
desperate
knowing
he
was
protesting
to
the
man
of
all
men
in
wheeling
who
did
care
and
who
could
do
least
about
it
if
he
did
what
this
crazy
talk
about
wolves
i
do
know
what
a
son
of
the
wolf
is
and
i
do
think
you
or
anybody
does
all
i
know
is
that
i
was
acting
and
everybody
began
howling
you
supposed
to
know
a
son
of
the
wolf
by
his
unculture
his
ignorance
his
violence
but
you
chopped
down
three
people
and
i
only
picked
up
a
piece
of
bread
and
supposed
to
be
the
dangerous
one
wolves
never
know
they
wolves
sighed
citizen
boyne
fish
probably
think
they
birds
and
you
evidently
think
you
a
citizen
would
a
citizen
speak
as
you
are
speaking
but
they
going
to
kill
us
then
why
are
you
composing
your
death
poem
glenn
tropile
took
a
deep
breath
something
was
biting
him
it
was
bad
enough
that
he
was
about
to
die
bad
enough
that
he
had
done
nothing
worth
dying
for
but
what
was
gnawing
at
him
now
had
nothing
to
do
with
dying
the
percentages
were
going
the
wrong
way
this
pale
citizen
was
getting
an
edge
on
him
an
engorged
gland
in
tropile
adrenals
it
was
only
a
pinhead
in
citizen
boyne
gushed
raw
hormones
into
his
bloodstream
he
could
die
yes
that
was
a
skill
everyone
had
to
acquire
sooner
or
later
but
while
he
was
alive
he
could
not
stand
to
be
bested
in
an
encounter
an
argument
a
relationship
not
and
stay
alive
wolf
call
him
wolf
call
him
operator
or
percentage
player
call
him
sharp
article
call
him
gamesman
if
there
was
an
advantage
to
be
derived
he
would
derive
it
it
was
the
way
he
was
put
together
he
said
for
time
you
right
stupid
of
me
i
must
have
lost
my
head
he
thought
some
men
think
by
poking
problems
apart
some
think
by
laying
facts
side
by
side
to
compare
tropile
thinking
was
neither
of
these
but
a
species
of
judo
he
conceded
to
his
opponent
such
things
as
strength
armor
resource
he
did
need
these
things
for
himself
to
every
contest
the
opponent
brought
enough
of
them
to
supply
two
it
was
tropile
habit
and
wolfish
he
had
to
admit
to
use
the
opponent
strength
against
him
to
break
the
opponent
against
his
own
steel
walls
he
thought
the
first
thing
was
to
make
up
his
mind
he
was
wolf
then
let
him
wolf
he
would
stay
around
for
the
spinal
tap
he
would
go
from
there
but
how
the
second
thing
was
to
plan
there
were
obstacles
citizen
boyne
was
one
the
keeper
of
the
house
of
the
five
regulations
was
another
where
was
the
pole
which
would
permit
him
to
vault
over
these
hurdles
there
was
always
his
wife
gala
he
owned
her
she
would
do
what
he
wished
provided
he
made
her
to
do
it
yes
gala
he
walked
to
the
door
and
shouted
to
citizen
harmane
keeper
i
must
see
my
wife
have
her
brought
to
me
it
was
impossible
for
the
keeper
to
refuse
he
called
gently
i
will
invite
the
citizeness
and
toddled
away
the
third
thing
was
time
tropile
turned
to
citizen
boyne
citizen
he
said
persuasively
since
your
death
poem
is
ready
and
mine
is
not
will
you
be
gracious
enough
to
go
first
when
they
when
they
come
citizen
boyne
looked
temperately
at
his
cellmate
and
made
the
quirked
smile
you
see
he
said
wolf
and
that
was
true
but
what
was
also
true
was
that
boyne
could
and
did
refuse
iv
half
a
world
away
the
pyramid
sat
on
its
peak
as
it
had
sat
since
the
days
when
earth
had
a
real
sun
of
its
own
it
was
of
no
importance
to
the
pyramid
that
glenn
tropile
was
about
to
receive
a
slim
catheter
into
his
spine
to
drain
his
saps
and
his
life
it
did
matter
to
the
pyramid
that
the
pretext
for
the
execution
was
an
act
which
human
history
had
long
stopped
considering
a
capital
crime
ritual
sacrifice
in
any
guise
made
no
difference
to
the
pyramid
the
pyramid
saw
them
come
and
the
pyramid
saw
them
go
if
the
pyramid
could
be
said
to
see
one
human
being
more
or
less
what
matter
who
bothers
to
take
a
census
of
the
cells
in
a
hangnail
and
yet
the
pyramid
did
have
a
kind
of
interest
in
glenn
tropile
or
at
least
in
the
human
race
of
which
he
was
a
part
nobody
knew
much
about
the
pyramids
but
everybody
knew
much
they
wanted
something
else
why
would
they
have
bothered
to
steal
the
earth
the
date
of
the
theft
was
a
great
year
the
year
of
the
first
landings
on
the
runaway
planet
that
had
come
blundering
into
the
solar
system
maybe
those
landings
were
a
mistake
although
they
were
a
very
great
triumph
too
but
maybe
if
it
had
been
for
the
landings
the
runaway
planet
might
have
run
right
through
the
ecliptic
and
away
however
the
triumphal
mistake
was
made
and
that
was
the
first
time
a
human
eye
saw
a
pyramid
shortly
after
though
not
before
a
radio
message
was
sent
that
human
eye
winked
out
forever
but
by
then
the
damage
was
done
what
passed
in
a
pyramid
for
attention
had
been
attracted
the
next
thing
that
happened
set
the
wireless
channels
between
palomar
and
pernambuco
between
greenwich
and
the
cape
of
good
hope
buzzing
and
worrying
as
astronomers
all
over
the
earth
reported
and
confirmed
and
reconfirmed
the
astonishing
fact
that
our
planet
was
on
the
move
rejoice
in
messias
had
come
to
take
us
away
a
world
of
ten
billion
people
some
of
them
brilliant
many
of
them
brave
built
and
flung
the
giant
rockets
of
operation
up
at
the
invader
nothing
the
first
and
only
interplanetary
expeditionary
force
was
boosted
up
to
and
dropped
onto
the
new
planet
to
strike
back
nothing
earth
moved
spirally
outward
if
a
battle
could
not
be
won
then
perhaps
a
migration
new
ships
were
built
in
haste
but
they
lay
there
rusting
as
the
sun
grew
small
and
the
ice
grew
thick
because
where
was
there
to
go
not
mars
not
the
moon
which
was
trailing
alone
not
choking
venus
or
crushing
jupiter
the
migration
was
defeated
as
surely
as
the
war
there
being
no
place
to
migrate
to
one
pyramid
came
to
earth
only
one
it
shaved
the
crest
off
the
highest
mountain
there
was
and
squatted
on
it
an
observer
a
warden
whatever
it
was
it
stayed
the
sun
grew
too
distant
to
be
of
use
and
out
of
the
old
moon
the
pyramid
aliens
built
a
new
small
sun
in
the
sky
a
sun
that
burned
out
and
was
replaced
again
and
again
and
endlessly
again
it
had
been
a
fierce
struggle
against
unbeatable
odds
on
the
part
of
the
ten
billion
and
when
the
uselessness
of
struggle
was
demonstrated
at
last
many
of
the
ten
billion
froze
to
death
and
many
of
them
starved
and
nearly
all
of
the
rest
had
something
frozen
or
starved
out
of
them
and
what
was
left
two
centuries
and
more
later
was
more
or
less
like
citizen
boyne
except
for
a
few
a
very
few
like
glenn
tropile
gala
tropile
stared
miserably
at
her
husband
i
want
to
get
out
of
here
he
was
saying
urgently
they
mean
to
kill
me
gala
you
know
you
ca
make
yourself
suffer
by
letting
them
kill
me
she
wailed
i
tropile
looked
over
his
shoulder
citizen
boyne
was
fingering
the
textured
contrasts
of
a
golden
which
had
been
his
father
and
soon
would
be
his
son
boyne
eyes
were
closed
and
he
was
listening
tropile
leaned
forward
and
deliberately
put
his
hand
on
his
wife
arm
she
started
and
flushed
of
course
you
he
said
and
what
more
you
will
you
can
help
me
get
out
of
here
i
insist
on
it
gala
because
i
must
save
you
that
pain
he
took
his
hand
off
her
arm
content
he
said
harshly
darling
do
you
think
i
know
how
much
always
meant
to
each
other
she
looked
at
him
wretchedly
fretfully
she
tore
at
the
billowing
filmy
sleeve
of
her
summer
blouse
the
seams
had
been
loosened
there
had
not
been
time
she
had
just
been
getting
into
the
appropriate
sun
day
costume
to
be
worn
under
the
parka
when
the
messenger
had
come
with
the
news
about
her
husband
she
avoided
his
eyes
if
you
really
wolf
tropile
pulsed
and
filled
him
with
confident
strength
know
what
i
am
you
better
than
anyone
else
it
was
a
sly
reminder
of
their
curious
furtive
behavior
together
like
the
hand
on
her
arm
it
had
its
effect
after
all
why
do
we
quarrel
the
way
we
did
last
night
he
hurried
on
the
job
of
the
rowel
was
to
spur
her
to
action
not
to
inflame
a
wound
because
we
to
each
other
i
know
that
you
would
count
on
me
to
help
if
you
were
in
trouble
and
i
know
that
you
be
hurt
gala
if
i
did
count
on
you
she
sniffled
and
scuffed
the
bright
strap
over
her
sandal
then
she
met
his
eyes
it
was
the
of
the
argument
of
course
glenn
tropile
knew
just
how
heavily
he
could
rely
on
the
of
a
quarrel
she
was
submitting
she
glanced
furtively
at
citizen
boyne
and
lowered
her
voice
what
do
i
have
to
do
she
whispered
in
five
minutes
she
was
gone
but
that
was
more
than
enough
time
tropile
had
at
least
thirty
minutes
left
they
would
take
boyne
first
he
had
seen
to
that
and
once
boyne
was
gone
tropile
wrenched
a
leg
off
his
stool
and
sat
precariously
balanced
on
the
other
two
he
tossed
the
loose
leg
clattering
into
a
corner
the
keeper
of
the
house
of
five
regulations
ambled
by
and
glanced
into
the
room
wolf
what
happened
to
your
stool
tropile
made
a
sign
of
it
does
matter
except
it
hard
to
meditate
sitting
on
this
thing
with
every
muscle
tensing
and
fighting
against
every
other
to
keep
my
balance
the
keeper
made
an
overruling
sign
of
it
your
last
wolf
he
reminded
tropile
i
fix
the
stool
for
you
he
entered
and
slammed
and
banged
it
together
and
left
with
an
expression
of
mild
concern
even
a
son
of
the
wolf
was
entitled
to
the
fullest
appreciation
of
that
unique
opportunity
for
meditation
the
last
before
a
donation
in
five
minutes
the
keeper
was
back
looking
solemn
and
yet
glad
like
a
bearer
of
serious
but
welcome
tidings
it
is
the
time
for
the
first
donation
he
announced
which
of
you
him
said
tropile
quickly
pointing
boyne
opened
his
eyes
calmly
and
nodded
he
got
to
his
feet
made
a
formal
leavetaking
bow
to
tropile
and
followed
the
keeper
toward
his
donation
and
his
death
as
they
were
going
out
tropile
coughed
a
cough
the
keeper
paused
what
is
it
wolf
tropile
showed
him
the
empty
water
pitcher
empty
all
right
he
had
emptied
it
out
the
window
my
apologies
the
keeper
said
flustered
and
hurried
boyne
along
he
came
back
almost
at
once
to
fill
the
pitcher
even
though
he
should
be
there
to
watch
boyne
ceremonial
donation
tropile
stood
looking
at
the
keeper
his
beginning
to
pound
like
the
rolling
boil
of
water
the
keeper
was
at
a
disadvantage
he
had
been
neglectful
of
his
charge
a
broken
stool
no
water
in
the
pitcher
and
a
citizen
brought
up
in
a
citizen
maze
of
consideration
and
tact
could
not
help
but
be
humiliated
seeking
to
make
amends
tropile
pressed
his
advantage
home
wait
he
said
to
the
keeper
like
to
talk
to
you
the
keeper
hesitated
torn
the
donation
damn
the
donation
tropile
said
calmly
after
all
what
is
it
but
sticking
a
pipe
into
a
man
backbone
and
sucking
out
the
juice
that
keeps
him
alive
it
killing
that
all
the
keeper
turned
literally
white
tropile
was
speaking
blasphemy
and
he
was
stopping
i
want
to
tell
you
about
my
wife
tropile
went
on
assuming
a
confidential
air
now
there
a
real
not
one
of
these
citizenesses
you
know
why
she
and
i
used
to
he
hesitated
you
a
man
of
the
world
are
you
he
demanded
i
mean
you
seen
life
i
suppose
so
the
keeper
said
faintly
then
you
wo
be
shocked
tropile
lied
well
let
me
tell
you
there
a
lot
to
women
that
these
citizens
do
know
about
boy
ever
see
a
woman
knee
he
sniggered
ever
kiss
a
woman
with
he
winked
with
the
ever
sit
in
a
big
armchair
say
with
a
woman
in
your
all
soft
and
heavy
and
kind
of
warm
and
slumped
up
against
your
chest
you
know
and
he
stopped
and
swallowed
he
was
almost
making
himself
retch
it
was
so
hard
to
say
these
things
but
he
forced
himself
to
go
on
well
what
she
and
i
used
to
do
plenty
all
the
time
that
what
i
call
a
real
he
stopped
warned
by
the
keeper
sudden
change
of
expression
glazed
eyes
strangling
breath
he
had
gone
too
far
he
had
only
wanted
to
paralyze
the
man
revolt
him
put
him
out
of
commission
but
he
was
overdoing
it
he
jumped
forward
and
caught
the
keeper
as
he
fell
fainting
tropile
callously
emptied
the
water
pitcher
over
the
man
the
keeper
sneezed
and
sat
up
groggily
he
focused
his
eyes
on
tropile
and
agonizedly
blushed
tropile
said
harshly
i
wish
to
see
the
new
sun
from
the
street
the
request
was
incredible
even
after
the
unbelievable
obscenities
he
had
heard
the
keeper
was
not
prepared
for
this
he
was
staggered
tropile
was
in
detention
regarding
the
fifth
regulation
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
such
persons
were
not
to
be
released
from
their
quarters
the
keeper
knew
it
the
world
knew
it
tropile
knew
it
it
was
an
obscenity
even
greater
than
the
lurid
tales
of
perverted
lust
for
tropile
had
asked
something
which
was
impossible
no
one
asked
anything
that
was
impossible
to
grant
for
no
one
could
ever
refuse
anything
that
was
utterly
graceless
unthinkable
one
could
only
attempt
to
compromise
the
keeper
stammeringly
said
may
i
may
i
let
you
see
the
new
sun
from
the
corridor
and
even
that
was
wretchedly
wrong
but
he
had
to
offer
something
one
always
offered
something
the
keeper
had
never
since
babyhood
given
a
flat
no
to
anybody
about
anything
no
citizen
had
a
flat
no
led
to
anger
strong
words
perhaps
even
hurt
feelings
the
only
flat
no
conceivable
was
the
enormous
terminal
no
of
an
amok
short
of
that
one
offered
one
split
the
difference
one
was
invariably
filled
with
tepid
pleasure
when
invariably
the
offer
was
accepted
the
difference
was
split
both
parties
were
satisfied
that
will
do
for
a
start
tropile
snarled
open
man
open
make
me
wait
the
keeper
reeled
and
unlatched
the
door
to
the
corridor
now
the
street
i
ca
burst
in
an
anguished
cry
from
the
keeper
he
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
and
began
to
sob
hopelessly
incapacitated
the
street
tropile
said
remorselessly
he
himself
felt
wrenchingly
ill
he
was
going
against
custom
that
had
ruled
his
own
life
as
surely
as
the
keeper
but
he
was
wolf
i
be
wolf
he
growled
and
advanced
upon
the
keeper
my
wife
he
said
i
did
finish
telling
you
sometimes
she
used
to
put
her
arm
around
me
and
just
snuggle
up
and
i
remember
one
time
she
kissed
my
ear
broad
daylight
it
felt
funny
and
warm
i
describe
it
whimpering
the
keeper
flung
the
keys
at
tropile
and
tottered
brokenly
away
he
was
out
of
the
action
tropile
himself
was
nearly
as
badly
off
the
difference
was
that
he
continued
to
function
the
words
coming
from
him
had
seared
like
acid
in
his
throat
they
call
me
wolf
he
said
aloud
reeling
against
the
wall
i
will
be
one
he
unlocked
the
outer
door
and
his
wife
was
waiting
holding
in
her
arms
the
things
he
had
asked
her
to
bring
tropile
said
strangely
to
her
i
am
steel
and
fire
i
am
wolf
full
of
the
old
moxie
she
wailed
glenn
are
you
sure
i
doing
the
right
thing
he
laughed
unsteadily
and
led
her
by
the
arm
through
the
deserted
streets
v
citizen
germyn
as
was
his
right
by
position
and
status
as
a
connoisseur
helped
prepare
citizen
boyne
for
his
donation
there
was
nothing
much
to
it
which
made
it
an
elaborate
and
lengthy
task
according
to
the
ethic
of
the
citizens
it
had
to
be
protracted
each
step
being
surrounded
by
fullest
dress
of
ritual
it
was
done
in
the
broad
daylight
of
the
new
sun
and
as
many
of
the
three
hundred
citizens
of
wheeling
as
could
manage
it
were
in
the
courtyard
of
the
old
federal
building
to
watch
the
nature
of
the
ceremony
was
this
a
man
who
revealed
himself
wolf
or
who
finally
crumbled
under
the
demands
of
life
and
ran
amok
could
not
be
allowed
to
live
he
was
hauled
before
an
audience
of
his
equals
and
permitted
with
the
help
of
regretful
force
if
that
should
be
necessary
but
preferably
not
to
make
the
donation
of
spinal
fluid
execution
was
murder
and
murder
was
not
permitted
under
the
gentle
code
of
citizens
this
was
not
execution
the
draining
of
a
man
spinal
fluid
did
not
kill
him
it
only
insured
that
after
a
time
and
with
much
suffering
his
internal
chemistry
would
so
arrange
itself
that
it
would
continue
to
function
only
not
in
a
way
that
would
sustain
life
once
the
donation
was
made
the
problem
was
completely
altered
of
course
suffering
was
bad
in
itself
to
save
the
donor
from
the
suffering
that
lay
ahead
it
was
the
custom
to
have
the
oldest
and
gentlest
citizen
on
hand
stand
by
with
a
knife
when
the
donation
was
complete
the
donor
head
was
removed
purely
to
avert
suffering
that
was
not
execution
either
but
only
the
hastening
of
an
inevitable
end
the
dozen
or
so
citizens
whose
rank
permitted
them
to
assist
then
dissolved
the
spinal
fluids
in
water
and
ceremoniously
sipped
them
at
which
time
it
was
proper
to
offer
a
small
poem
in
commentary
all
in
all
it
was
a
perfectly
splendid
opportunity
for
the
purest
form
of
meditation
for
everyone
concerned
citizen
germyn
whose
role
was
catheter
bearer
took
his
place
behind
the
introducer
bearer
the
annunciators
and
the
questioner
of
purpose
as
he
passed
citizen
boyne
germyn
assisted
him
to
assume
the
proper
position
boyne
looked
up
gratefully
and
germyn
found
the
occasion
correct
for
a
commendatory
the
questioner
of
purpose
said
solemnly
to
boyne
it
is
your
privilege
to
make
a
donation
here
today
do
you
wish
to
do
so
i
do
said
boyne
raptly
the
anxiety
had
passed
clearly
he
was
confident
of
making
a
good
donation
germyn
approved
with
all
his
heart
the
annunciators
in
alternate
stanzas
announced
the
right
pause
for
meditation
to
the
meager
crowd
and
all
fell
silent
citizen
germyn
began
the
process
of
blanking
out
his
mind
to
ready
himself
for
the
great
opportunity
to
appreciate
that
lay
ahead
a
sound
distracted
him
he
glanced
up
irritably
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
house
of
the
five
regulations
a
man
voice
carrying
but
no
one
else
appeared
to
notice
it
all
of
the
watchers
all
of
those
on
the
stone
steps
were
in
somber
meditation
germyn
tried
to
return
his
thoughts
to
where
they
belonged
but
something
was
troubling
him
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
donor
and
there
had
been
something
something
he
angrily
permitted
himself
to
look
up
once
more
to
see
just
what
it
had
been
about
citizen
boyne
that
had
attracted
his
attention
yes
there
something
over
the
form
of
citizen
boyne
silent
barely
visible
a
flicker
of
life
and
motion
nothing
tangible
it
was
as
if
the
air
itself
were
in
motion
it
was
germyn
thought
with
a
bursting
heart
it
was
an
eye
the
veritable
miracle
of
translation
and
it
was
about
to
take
place
here
and
now
upon
the
person
of
citizen
boyne
and
no
one
knew
it
but
germyn
himself
in
this
last
surmise
citizen
germyn
was
wrong
or
was
he
true
no
other
human
eyes
saw
the
thing
that
twisted
the
air
over
boyne
prostrate
body
but
there
was
in
a
sense
another
witness
some
thousands
of
miles
away
the
pyramid
on
mount
everest
stirred
it
did
not
move
but
something
about
it
moved
or
changed
or
radiated
the
pyramid
surveyed
its
cabbage
patch
wristwatch
mine
as
much
sense
it
may
be
to
say
wristwatch
patch
or
cabbage
mine
at
any
rate
it
surveyed
what
to
it
was
a
place
where
intricate
mechanisms
grew
ripened
and
were
dug
up
at
the
moment
of
usefulness
whereupon
they
were
and
wired
into
circuits
through
signals
perceptible
to
it
the
pyramids
had
become
aware
that
one
of
its
mechanisms
was
now
ready
to
be
plucked
harvested
the
pyramid
blood
was
dielectric
fluid
its
limbs
were
electrostatic
charges
its
philosophy
was
unscrew
it
and
push
its
motive
was
survival
survival
today
was
not
what
survival
once
had
been
for
a
pyramid
once
survival
had
merely
been
gliding
along
on
a
cushion
of
repellent
charges
streaming
electrons
behind
for
the
push
sending
pulses
out
often
enough
to
get
a
picture
of
their
bounced
return
to
integrate
deep
inside
if
the
picture
showed
something
metabolizable
one
metabolized
it
one
broke
it
down
into
molecules
by
lashing
it
with
the
surplus
protons
left
over
from
the
dispersed
electrons
one
adsorbed
the
molecules
sometimes
the
metabolizable
object
was
an
immobile
and
sometimes
a
mobile
a
vague
theoretical
frivolous
classification
to
a
philosophy
whose
basis
was
that
unscrewed
if
it
was
a
mobile
one
sometimes
had
to
move
after
it
that
was
the
difference
the
essential
was
survival
not
making
idle
distinctions
and
one
small
part
of
survival
today
was
the
everest
pyramid
job
it
sat
and
waited
it
sent
out
its
pulses
bouncing
and
scattering
and
it
bounced
and
scattered
them
additionally
on
their
return
deep
inside
the
distorted
picture
was
reintegrated
deeper
inside
it
was
interpreted
and
evaluated
for
its
part
in
survival
there
was
a
need
for
certain
mechanisms
which
grew
on
this
planet
at
irregular
times
the
pyramid
evaluated
the
picture
to
the
effect
that
a
mechanism
a
wristwatch
so
to
speak
was
ripe
for
plucking
and
by
electrostatic
charges
it
did
so
the
electrostatic
charges
in
forming
produced
what
humans
called
an
eye
but
the
pyramid
had
no
use
for
names
it
merely
plucked
when
a
mechanism
was
ripe
it
had
found
that
a
mechanism
was
ripe
now
a
world
away
before
the
steps
of
wheeling
federal
building
electrostatic
charges
gathered
above
a
component
whose
name
was
citizen
boyne
there
was
a
small
sound
like
the
clapping
of
two
hands
which
made
the
three
hundred
citizens
of
wheeling
jerk
upright
out
of
their
meditations
the
sound
was
air
filling
the
gap
that
had
once
been
occupied
by
citizen
boyne
who
had
instantly
vanished
who
had
in
a
word
been
ripe
and
therefore
been
plucked
vi
glenn
tropile
and
his
sobbing
wife
passed
the
night
in
the
stubble
of
a
cornfield
neither
of
them
slept
much
tropile
numbed
by
contact
with
the
iron
chill
of
the
field
it
would
be
months
before
the
new
sun
warmed
the
earth
enough
for
it
to
begin
radiating
in
turn
tossed
restlessly
dreaming
he
was
wolf
let
it
be
so
he
told
himself
again
and
again
i
be
wolf
i
will
strike
back
at
the
citizens
i
will
always
the
thought
trailed
off
he
would
exactly
what
could
he
do
migration
was
an
answer
go
to
another
city
with
gala
he
guessed
start
a
new
life
where
he
was
not
known
as
wolf
and
then
what
try
to
live
a
sheep
life
as
he
had
tried
all
his
years
and
there
was
the
question
of
whether
in
fact
he
could
manage
to
find
a
city
where
he
was
not
known
the
human
race
was
migratory
in
these
years
of
subjection
to
the
never
quite
understood
rule
of
the
pyramids
it
was
a
matter
of
insulation
when
the
new
sun
was
young
it
was
hot
and
there
was
plenty
of
warmth
it
was
possible
to
spread
north
and
south
away
from
final
line
of
permafrost
which
in
north
america
came
just
above
the
old
line
when
the
sun
was
dying
the
cold
spread
down
the
race
followed
the
seasons
soon
all
of
wheeling
would
be
spreading
north
again
and
how
was
he
to
be
sure
that
none
of
wheeling
citizens
might
not
turn
up
wherever
he
might
go
he
could
be
sure
that
was
the
answer
to
that
all
right
scratch
migration
what
remained
he
could
with
gala
he
guessed
live
a
solitary
life
on
the
fringes
of
cultivated
land
they
both
had
some
skill
at
rummaging
the
old
storehouses
of
the
ancients
and
there
was
still
food
and
other
commodities
to
be
found
but
even
a
wolf
is
gregarious
by
nature
and
there
were
bleak
hours
in
that
night
when
tropile
found
himself
close
to
sobbing
with
his
wife
at
the
first
break
of
dawn
he
was
up
gala
had
fallen
into
a
light
and
restless
sleep
he
called
her
awake
we
have
to
move
he
said
harshly
maybe
they
get
up
enough
guts
to
follow
us
i
do
want
them
to
find
us
silently
she
got
up
they
rolled
and
tied
the
blankets
she
had
bought
they
ate
quickly
from
the
food
she
had
brought
they
made
packs
and
put
them
on
their
shoulders
and
started
to
walk
one
thing
in
their
favor
they
were
moving
fast
faster
than
any
citizen
was
likely
to
follow
all
the
same
tropile
kept
looking
nervously
behind
him
they
hurried
north
and
east
and
that
was
a
mistake
because
by
noon
they
found
themselves
blocked
by
water
once
it
had
been
a
river
the
melting
of
the
polar
ice
caps
that
had
submerged
the
coasts
of
the
old
continents
had
drowned
it
out
and
now
it
was
salt
water
but
whatever
it
was
it
was
impassable
they
would
have
to
skirt
it
westward
until
they
found
a
bridge
or
a
boat
we
can
stop
and
eat
tropile
said
grudgingly
trying
not
to
despair
they
slumped
to
the
ground
it
was
warmer
now
tropile
found
himself
getting
drowsier
drowsier
he
jerked
erect
and
stared
around
belligerently
beside
him
his
wife
was
lying
motionless
though
her
eyes
were
open
gazing
at
the
sky
tropile
sighed
and
stretched
out
a
moment
rest
he
promised
himself
and
then
a
quick
bite
to
eat
and
then
onward
he
was
sound
asleep
when
they
spotted
him
there
was
a
flutter
of
iron
bird
wings
from
overhead
tropile
jumped
up
out
of
his
sleep
awakening
to
panic
it
was
outside
the
possibility
of
belief
but
there
it
was
in
the
sky
over
him
etched
black
against
a
cloud
a
helicopter
and
men
staring
out
of
it
staring
down
at
him
a
helicopter
but
there
were
no
helicopters
or
none
that
flew
if
there
had
been
fuel
to
fly
them
with
if
any
man
had
had
the
skill
to
make
them
fly
it
was
impossible
and
yet
there
it
was
and
the
men
were
looking
at
him
and
the
impossible
great
whirling
thing
was
coming
down
nearer
he
began
to
run
in
the
downward
wash
of
air
from
the
vanes
but
it
was
no
use
there
were
three
men
and
they
were
fresh
and
he
was
he
stopped
dropping
into
the
fighter
crouch
that
is
into
the
human
body
ready
to
do
battle
the
men
did
want
to
fight
they
laughed
and
one
of
them
said
amiably
past
your
bedtime
boy
get
in
we
take
you
home
tropile
stood
poised
hands
take
take
you
home
yeah
where
you
belong
tropile
not
back
to
wheeling
if
that
what
is
worrying
you
where
i
where
you
belong
then
tropile
understood
he
got
into
the
helicopter
wonderingly
home
so
there
a
home
for
such
as
he
he
was
alone
he
need
keep
his
solitary
self
apart
he
could
be
with
his
own
kind
he
remembered
gala
tropile
and
paused
one
of
the
men
said
with
quick
understanding
your
wife
i
think
we
saw
her
about
half
a
mile
from
here
heading
back
to
wheeling
as
fast
as
she
could
go
tropile
nodded
that
was
better
after
all
gala
was
no
wolf
though
he
had
tried
his
best
to
make
her
one
one
of
the
men
closed
the
door
another
did
something
with
levers
and
wheels
the
vanes
whooshed
around
overhead
the
helicopter
bounced
on
its
landing
legs
and
then
rocked
up
and
away
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
glenn
tropile
looked
on
the
land
they
did
fly
high
but
glenn
tropile
had
never
flown
at
all
and
the
two
or
three
hundred
feet
of
air
beneath
made
him
faint
and
queasy
they
danced
through
the
passes
in
the
west
virginia
hills
crossed
icy
streams
and
rivers
swung
past
old
empty
towns
which
no
longer
even
had
names
of
their
own
they
saw
no
one
it
was
something
over
four
hundred
miles
to
where
they
were
going
one
of
the
men
told
him
they
made
it
easily
before
dark
as
tropile
walked
through
the
town
in
the
evening
light
electricity
flared
white
and
violet
in
the
buildings
around
him
imagine
electricity
was
calories
and
calories
were
to
be
hoarded
there
were
other
walkers
in
the
street
their
gait
was
not
the
economical
shuffle
with
pendant
arms
they
burned
energy
visibly
they
swung
they
it
had
been
chiseled
on
his
brain
in
earliest
childhood
that
such
walking
was
wrong
reprehensible
debilitating
it
wasted
calories
these
people
did
not
look
debilitated
and
they
seem
to
mind
wasting
calories
it
was
an
ordinary
sort
of
town
apparently
named
princeton
it
did
not
have
the
transient
look
to
it
of
say
wheeling
or
altoona
or
gary
in
tropile
experience
it
looked
like
well
it
looked
permanent
tropile
had
heard
of
a
town
called
princeton
but
it
happened
that
he
had
never
passed
through
it
southwarding
or
northbound
there
was
no
reason
why
he
or
anybody
should
or
should
not
have
still
there
was
a
possibility
once
he
thought
of
it
that
things
were
somehow
so
arranged
that
they
should
not
maybe
it
was
all
on
purpose
like
every
town
it
was
underpopulated
but
not
so
much
so
as
most
perhaps
one
living
space
in
five
was
used
a
high
ratio
the
man
beside
him
was
named
haendl
one
of
the
men
from
the
helicopter
they
had
talked
much
on
the
flight
and
they
did
talk
much
now
eat
first
haendl
said
and
took
tropile
to
a
bright
and
busy
sort
of
food
stall
only
it
was
a
stall
it
was
a
restaurant
this
haendl
what
to
make
of
him
he
should
have
been
disgusting
nasty
an
abomination
he
had
no
manners
whatever
he
did
know
or
at
least
did
use
the
seventeen
conventional
gestures
he
let
tropile
walk
behind
him
and
to
his
left
though
he
was
easily
five
years
tropile
senior
when
he
ate
he
the
sip
of
appreciation
the
pause
of
first
surfeit
the
thrice
proffered
share
meant
nothing
to
him
he
laughed
when
tropile
tried
to
give
him
the
elder
portion
cheerfully
patronizing
this
man
haendl
said
to
tropile
that
stuffs
all
right
when
you
do
have
anything
better
to
do
with
your
time
those
poor
mutts
do
they
die
of
boredom
without
their
cults
and
they
do
have
the
resources
to
do
anything
bigger
yes
i
do
know
the
gestures
seventeen
delicate
ways
of
communicating
emotions
too
refined
for
words
the
hell
with
them
tropile
i
got
words
you
learn
them
too
tropile
ate
silently
trying
to
think
a
man
arrived
threw
himself
in
a
chair
glanced
curiously
at
tropile
and
said
haendl
the
somerville
road
the
creek
backed
up
when
it
froze
flooded
bad
ruined
everything
tropile
ventured
the
flood
ruined
the
road
the
road
no
say
you
must
be
the
fellow
haendl
went
after
tropile
that
the
name
he
leaned
across
the
table
pumped
tropile
hand
we
had
the
road
nicely
blocked
he
explained
the
flood
washed
it
clean
now
we
have
to
block
it
again
haendl
said
take
the
tractor
if
you
need
it
the
man
nodded
and
left
haendl
said
eat
up
we
wasting
time
about
that
road
we
keep
all
entrances
blocked
up
see
why
let
a
lot
of
sheep
in
and
out
sheep
the
opposite
said
haendl
of
wolves
take
ten
billion
people
and
say
that
out
of
every
million
of
them
one
just
one
is
different
he
has
a
talent
for
survival
call
him
wolf
ten
thousand
of
him
in
a
world
of
ten
billion
squeeze
them
freeze
them
cut
them
down
let
old
rejoice
in
messias
loom
in
the
terrifying
sky
and
so
abduct
the
earth
that
the
human
race
is
decimated
fractionated
reduced
to
what
is
in
comparison
a
bare
handful
of
chilled
stunned
survivors
there
are
ten
billion
people
in
the
world
any
more
no
not
by
a
factor
of
a
thousand
maybe
there
are
as
many
as
ten
million
more
or
less
rattling
around
in
the
space
their
enormous
elder
generations
made
for
them
and
of
these
ten
million
how
many
are
wolf
ten
thousand
you
understand
tropile
said
haendl
we
survive
i
do
care
what
you
call
us
the
sheep
call
us
wolves
me
i
kind
of
call
us
supermen
we
have
a
talent
for
survival
tropile
nodded
beginning
to
understand
the
way
i
survived
the
house
of
the
five
regulations
haendl
gave
him
a
pitying
look
the
way
you
survived
thirty
years
of
sheephood
before
that
come
on
it
was
a
tour
of
inspection
they
went
into
a
building
big
looking
like
any
other
big
and
useful
building
of
the
ancients
gray
stone
walls
windows
with
ragged
spears
of
glass
inside
though
it
like
the
others
two
down
tropile
winced
and
turned
away
from
the
flood
of
violet
light
that
poured
out
of
a
quartz
on
top
of
a
squat
steel
cone
perfectly
harmless
tropile
you
do
have
to
worry
haendl
boomed
know
what
you
looking
at
there
a
fusion
reactor
down
there
heat
power
all
the
power
we
need
do
you
know
what
that
means
he
stared
soberly
down
at
the
flaring
violet
light
of
the
inspection
port
come
on
he
said
abruptly
to
tropile
another
building
also
big
also
gray
stone
a
cracked
inscription
over
the
entrance
read
orial
hall
of
humanities
the
this
time
was
not
light
it
was
sound
hammering
screeching
rattling
rumbling
men
were
doing
noisy
things
with
metal
and
machines
repair
shop
haendl
yelled
see
those
machines
they
belong
to
our
man
innison
we
salvaged
them
from
every
big
factory
ruin
we
could
find
give
innison
a
piece
of
metal
any
alloy
any
shape
and
one
of
those
machines
will
change
it
into
any
other
shape
and
damned
near
any
other
alloy
drill
it
cut
it
plane
it
weld
it
smelt
it
it
bond
it
you
tell
him
what
to
do
and
he
do
it
we
got
the
parts
to
make
six
tractors
and
cars
out
of
this
shop
and
we
got
other
shops
aircraft
in
farmingdale
and
wichita
armaments
in
wilmington
not
that
we
ca
make
some
armaments
here
innison
could
build
you
a
tank
if
he
had
to
complete
with
gun
what
a
tank
tropile
asked
haendl
only
looked
at
him
and
said
come
on
glenn
tropile
head
spun
dizzily
and
all
the
spectacles
merged
and
danced
in
his
mind
they
were
incredible
all
of
them
fusion
pile
machine
shop
vehicular
garage
aircraft
hangar
there
was
a
storeroom
under
the
seats
of
a
football
stadium
and
tropile
head
spun
on
his
shoulders
again
as
he
tried
to
count
the
cases
of
coffee
and
canned
soups
and
whiskey
and
beans
there
was
another
storeroom
only
this
one
was
called
an
armory
it
was
filled
with
guns
guns
that
could
be
loaded
with
cartridges
of
which
they
had
very
many
guns
which
when
you
loaded
them
and
pulled
the
trigger
would
fire
tropile
said
remembering
i
saw
a
gun
once
that
still
had
its
firing
pin
but
it
was
rusted
solid
these
work
tropile
said
haendl
you
can
kill
a
man
with
them
some
of
us
have
get
that
sheep
look
out
of
your
eyes
tropile
what
the
difference
how
you
execute
a
criminal
and
what
a
criminal
but
someone
who
represents
a
danger
to
your
world
we
prefer
a
gun
instead
of
the
donation
of
the
spinal
tap
because
it
quicker
because
it
less
messy
and
because
we
do
like
to
drink
spinal
fluid
no
matter
what
imaginary
therapeutic
or
symbolic
value
it
has
you
learn
but
he
did
add
come
on
they
had
arrived
where
they
were
going
it
was
a
small
room
in
the
building
that
housed
the
armory
and
it
held
among
other
things
a
rack
of
guns
sit
down
said
haendl
taking
one
of
the
guns
out
of
the
rack
thoughtfully
and
handling
it
as
the
doomed
boyne
had
caressed
his
it
was
the
latest
rifle
it
would
not
scatter
a
cluster
of
shots
in
a
coffee
can
at
more
than
two
and
a
half
miles
all
right
said
haendl
stroking
the
stock
you
seen
the
works
tropile
you
lived
thirty
years
with
sheep
you
seen
what
they
have
and
what
we
have
i
do
have
to
ask
you
to
make
a
choice
i
know
what
you
choose
the
only
thing
left
is
to
tell
you
what
want
from
a
faint
pulsing
began
inside
glenn
tropile
i
expected
we
be
getting
to
that
why
not
we
not
sheep
we
do
act
that
way
quid
pro
quo
remember
that
it
saves
time
you
seen
the
quid
now
we
come
to
the
quo
he
leaned
forward
tropile
what
do
you
know
about
the
pyramids
nothing
haendl
nodded
right
they
all
around
us
and
our
lives
are
beggared
because
of
them
and
we
do
even
know
why
we
do
have
the
least
idea
of
what
they
are
did
you
know
that
one
of
the
sheep
was
translated
in
wheeling
when
you
left
translated
tropile
listened
with
his
mouth
open
while
haendl
told
him
about
what
had
happened
to
citizen
boyne
so
he
did
make
the
donation
after
all
tropile
said
might
have
been
better
if
he
had
said
haendl
still
it
gave
you
a
chance
to
get
away
we
had
heard
never
mind
how
just
yet
that
wheeling
caught
itself
a
wolf
so
we
came
looking
for
you
but
you
were
already
gone
tropile
said
faintly
annoyed
you
were
damn
near
too
late
oh
no
tropile
haendl
assured
him
we
never
too
late
if
you
do
have
enough
guts
and
ingenuity
to
get
away
from
sheep
you
no
wolf
simple
as
that
but
there
this
translation
we
know
it
happens
but
we
do
even
know
what
it
is
all
we
know
people
disappear
there
a
new
sun
in
the
sky
every
five
years
or
so
who
makes
it
the
pyramids
how
we
do
know
that
sometimes
something
floats
around
in
the
air
and
we
call
it
an
eye
it
has
something
to
do
with
translation
something
to
do
with
the
pyramids
what
we
do
know
that
we
do
know
much
of
anything
interrupted
tropile
trying
to
hurry
him
along
not
about
the
pyramids
no
haendl
shook
his
head
hardly
anyone
has
ever
seen
one
for
that
matter
hardly
you
mean
you
have
oh
yes
there
a
pyramid
on
mount
everest
you
know
that
not
just
a
story
it
true
i
been
there
and
it
there
at
least
it
was
there
five
years
ago
right
after
the
last
sun
i
guess
it
has
moved
it
just
sits
there
tropile
listened
marveling
to
have
seen
a
real
pyramid
almost
he
had
thought
of
them
as
legends
contrived
to
account
for
such
established
physical
facts
as
the
eyes
and
translation
as
children
with
a
santa
claus
but
this
incredible
man
had
seen
it
somebody
dropped
an
on
it
way
back
haendl
continued
and
the
only
thing
that
happened
is
that
now
the
north
col
is
a
crater
you
ca
move
the
pyramid
you
ca
hurt
it
but
it
alive
it
has
been
there
alive
for
a
couple
of
hundred
years
and
that
about
all
we
know
about
the
pyramids
right
right
haendl
stood
up
tropile
that
what
all
of
this
is
all
about
he
gestured
around
him
guns
tanks
airplanes
we
want
to
know
more
we
going
to
find
out
more
and
then
we
going
to
fight
there
was
a
jarring
note
and
tropile
caught
at
it
sniffing
the
air
somehow
perhaps
it
was
his
that
told
him
this
very
positive
very
man
was
just
the
slightest
bit
unsure
of
himself
but
haendl
swept
on
and
tropile
for
a
moment
forgot
to
be
alert
we
had
a
party
up
mount
everest
five
years
ago
haendl
was
saying
we
did
find
out
a
thing
five
years
before
that
and
five
years
before
every
time
there
a
sun
while
it
is
still
warm
enough
to
give
a
party
a
chance
to
climb
up
the
sides
we
send
a
team
up
there
it
a
rough
job
we
give
it
to
the
new
boys
tropile
like
you
there
it
was
he
was
being
invited
to
attack
a
pyramid
tropile
hesitated
delicately
balanced
trying
to
get
the
of
this
negotiation
this
was
wolf
against
wolf
it
was
hard
there
had
to
be
an
advantage
there
is
an
advantage
haendl
said
aloud
tropile
jumped
but
then
he
remembered
wolf
against
wolf
haendl
went
on
what
you
get
out
of
it
is
your
life
in
the
first
place
you
understand
you
ca
get
out
now
we
do
want
sheep
meddling
around
and
in
the
second
place
there
a
considerable
hope
of
gain
he
stared
at
tropile
with
a
dreamer
eyes
we
do
send
parties
up
there
for
nothing
you
know
we
want
to
get
something
out
of
it
what
we
want
is
the
earth
the
earth
it
reeked
of
madness
but
this
man
was
mad
some
day
tropile
it
going
to
be
us
against
them
never
mind
the
sheep
they
do
count
it
going
to
be
pyramids
and
wolves
and
the
pyramids
wo
win
and
then
it
was
enough
to
curdle
the
blood
this
man
was
proposing
to
and
against
the
invulnerable
the
godlike
pyramids
but
he
was
glowing
and
the
fever
was
contagious
tropile
felt
his
own
blood
begin
to
pound
haendl
had
finished
his
and
then
but
he
did
have
to
the
and
then
was
obvious
and
then
the
world
takes
up
again
from
the
day
the
wandering
planet
first
came
into
view
and
then
we
go
back
to
our
own
solar
system
and
an
end
to
the
cycle
of
frost
and
hunger
and
then
the
wolves
can
rule
a
world
worth
ruling
it
was
a
meretricious
appeal
perhaps
but
it
could
not
be
refused
tropile
was
lost
he
said
you
can
put
away
the
gun
haendl
you
signed
me
up
vii
the
way
to
mount
everest
tropile
glumly
found
lay
through
supervising
the
colony
nursery
school
it
was
what
he
had
expected
but
it
had
the
advantages
that
while
his
charges
were
learning
he
was
learning
too
one
jump
ahead
of
the
he
found
that
the
wolves
far
from
being
predators
on
the
sheep
existed
with
them
in
a
far
more
complicated
ecological
relationship
there
were
wolves
all
through
sheepdom
they
leavened
the
dough
of
society
in
barbarously
simple
prose
a
primer
said
the
sons
of
the
wolf
are
good
at
numbers
and
money
you
and
your
friends
play
money
games
almost
as
soon
as
you
can
talk
and
you
can
think
in
percentages
and
compound
interest
when
you
want
to
most
people
are
not
able
to
do
this
true
thought
tropile
subvocally
reading
aloud
to
the
tots
that
was
how
it
had
been
with
him
sheep
are
afraid
of
the
sons
of
the
wolf
those
of
us
who
live
among
them
are
in
constant
danger
of
detection
and
death
although
ordinarily
a
wolf
can
take
care
of
himself
against
any
number
of
sheep
true
too
it
is
one
of
the
most
dangerous
assignments
a
wolf
can
be
given
to
live
among
the
sheep
yet
it
is
essential
without
us
they
would
die
of
stagnation
of
rot
eventually
of
hunger
it
did
have
to
be
spelled
out
any
further
sheep
ca
mend
their
own
fences
the
prose
was
horrifyingly
bald
and
the
children
were
horrifyingly
he
choked
on
the
word
but
managed
to
form
it
in
his
mind
the
verbal
taboos
lingered
he
found
after
he
had
broken
through
the
barriers
of
behavior
but
it
was
distressing
in
a
way
at
an
age
when
future
citizens
would
have
been
learning
their
little
pitcher
ways
these
children
were
learning
to
fight
the
perennial
argument
about
who
would
get
to
be
big
bill
zeckendorf
when
they
played
a
strange
game
called
zeckendorf
and
hilton
sometimes
ended
in
bloody
noses
and
nobody
nobody
at
all
meditated
on
connectivity
tropile
was
warned
not
to
do
it
himself
haendl
said
grimly
we
do
understand
it
and
we
do
like
what
we
do
understand
suspicious
animals
tropile
as
the
children
grow
older
we
give
them
just
enough
practice
so
they
can
go
into
one
meditation
and
get
the
feel
of
it
or
pretend
to
at
any
rate
if
they
have
to
pass
as
citizens
they
need
that
much
but
more
than
that
we
do
not
allow
allow
somehow
the
word
grated
somehow
his
began
to
pulse
we
have
our
suspicions
and
we
know
for
a
fact
that
sometimes
people
disappear
when
they
meditate
we
do
want
to
disappear
we
think
it
not
a
good
thing
to
disappear
do
meditate
tropile
you
hear
but
later
tropile
had
to
argue
the
point
he
picked
a
time
when
haendl
was
free
or
as
nearly
free
as
that
man
ever
was
the
whole
adult
colony
had
been
out
on
what
they
used
as
a
parade
ground
it
had
once
been
a
football
field
haendl
said
they
had
done
their
regular
infantry
drill
that
being
one
of
the
prices
one
paid
for
living
among
the
free
progressive
wolves
instead
of
the
dull
and
tepid
sheep
tropile
was
mightily
winded
but
he
cast
himself
on
the
ground
near
haendl
caught
his
breath
and
said
haendl
about
meditation
what
about
it
well
perhaps
you
do
really
grasp
it
tropile
searched
for
words
he
knew
what
he
wanted
to
say
how
could
anything
that
felt
as
good
as
oneness
be
bad
and
was
translation
after
all
so
rare
as
hardly
to
matter
but
he
was
sure
he
could
get
through
to
haendl
in
those
terms
he
tried
when
you
meditate
successfully
haendl
you
one
with
the
universe
do
you
know
what
i
mean
there
no
feeling
like
it
indescribable
peace
beauty
harmony
repose
it
the
world
cheapest
narcotic
haendl
snorted
oh
now
really
the
world
cheapest
religion
the
mutts
afford
gilded
idols
so
they
use
their
own
navels
that
all
it
is
they
ca
afford
alcohol
they
ca
even
afford
the
muscular
exertion
of
deep
breathing
that
would
throw
them
into
a
state
of
hyperventilated
oxygen
drunkenness
then
what
left
nothing
else
all
they
can
do
so
they
learn
it
they
define
it
as
pleasant
and
good
and
they
all
fixed
up
tropile
sighed
the
man
was
so
stubborn
then
a
thought
occurred
to
him
and
he
pushed
himself
up
on
his
elbows
are
you
leaving
something
out
what
about
translation
haendl
glowered
at
him
that
the
part
we
do
understand
but
surely
does
account
for
surely
it
does
haendl
mimicked
savagely
all
right
we
understand
it
and
we
afraid
of
it
kindly
do
not
tell
me
translation
is
the
supreme
act
of
total
disavowal
of
duality
unison
with
the
or
any
such
slop
you
do
know
what
it
is
and
neither
do
we
he
started
to
get
up
all
we
know
is
people
vanish
and
we
want
no
part
of
it
so
we
do
meditate
none
of
us
including
you
it
was
foolishness
this
drill
could
you
defeat
the
unreachable
himalayan
pyramid
with
a
flanking
maneuver
and
yet
it
was
all
foolishness
drill
and
diet
began
to
put
fat
and
flesh
and
muscle
on
tropile
body
and
something
other
than
that
on
his
mind
he
had
not
lost
the
edge
of
his
acquisitiveness
his
drive
his
whatever
it
was
that
made
the
difference
between
wolf
and
sheep
but
he
had
gained
something
happiness
well
if
happiness
is
a
sense
of
purpose
and
a
hope
that
the
purpose
can
be
accomplished
then
happiness
it
was
a
feeling
that
had
never
existed
in
his
life
before
always
it
had
been
the
glandular
compulsion
to
gain
an
advantage
and
that
was
gone
or
anyway
almost
gone
because
it
was
permitted
in
the
society
in
which
he
now
lived
glenn
tropile
sang
as
he
in
his
tractor
plowing
the
thawing
jersey
fields
still
a
faint
doubt
remained
squads
right
against
the
pyramids
stiffly
tropile
stopped
the
tractor
slowed
the
diesel
to
a
steady
and
got
off
it
was
hot
being
midsummer
of
the
calendar
the
pyramids
had
imposed
it
was
time
for
rest
and
maybe
something
to
eat
he
sat
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
as
farmers
always
have
done
and
opened
his
sandwiches
he
was
only
a
mile
or
so
from
princeton
but
he
might
as
well
have
been
in
limbo
there
was
no
sign
of
any
living
human
but
himself
the
northering
sheep
did
come
near
princeton
it
happened
that
way
on
purpose
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
moving
but
when
he
stood
up
for
a
better
look
into
the
woods
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
it
was
gone
wolf
wolf
that
is
it
could
have
been
a
bear
for
that
matter
there
was
talk
of
wolves
and
bears
around
princeton
and
although
tropile
knew
that
much
of
the
talk
was
assiduously
encouraged
by
men
like
haendl
he
also
knew
that
some
of
it
was
true
as
long
as
he
was
up
he
gathered
straw
from
the
litter
of
last
year
grass
gathered
sticks
under
the
trees
built
a
small
fire
and
put
water
on
to
boil
for
coffee
then
he
sat
back
and
ate
his
sandwiches
thinking
maybe
it
was
a
promotion
going
from
the
nursery
school
to
labor
in
the
fields
or
maybe
it
was
haendl
had
promised
him
a
place
in
the
expedition
that
would
maybe
discover
something
new
and
great
and
helpful
about
the
pyramids
and
that
might
still
come
to
pass
because
the
expedition
was
far
from
ready
to
leave
tropile
munched
his
sandwiches
thoughtfully
now
was
the
expedition
so
far
from
ready
to
leave
it
was
absolutely
essential
to
get
there
in
the
warmest
weather
possible
otherwise
mt
everest
was
unclimbable
generations
of
alpinists
had
proved
that
that
warmest
weather
was
rapidly
going
by
and
were
haendl
and
the
wolf
colony
so
insistent
on
building
tanks
arming
themselves
with
rifles
organizing
in
companies
and
squads
the
had
flustered
the
pyramid
what
lesser
weapon
could
uneasily
tropile
put
a
few
more
sticks
on
the
fire
staring
thoughtfully
into
the
canteen
cup
of
water
it
was
a
satisfyingly
hot
fire
he
noticed
abstractedly
the
water
was
very
nearly
ready
to
boil
half
across
the
world
the
pyramid
in
the
himalays
felt
or
heard
or
tasted
a
difference
possibly
the
pulses
that
had
gone
endlessly
wheep
wheep
wheep
were
now
going
possibly
the
electromagnetic
taste
of
was
now
spiced
with
a
tang
of
whatever
the
sign
was
the
pyramid
recognized
it
a
part
of
the
crop
it
tended
was
ready
to
harvest
the
ripening
bud
had
a
name
of
course
but
names
did
matter
to
the
pyramid
the
man
named
tropile
did
know
he
was
ripening
either
all
that
tropile
knew
was
that
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
a
year
he
had
succeeded
in
catching
each
stage
of
the
nine
perfect
states
of
in
its
purest
form
it
was
like
like
well
it
was
like
nothing
that
anyone
but
a
water
watcher
could
understand
he
observed
he
appreciated
he
encompassed
and
absorbed
the
myriad
subtle
perfections
of
time
of
shifting
transparency
of
sound
of
distribution
of
ebulliency
of
the
faint
faint
odor
of
steam
complete
glenn
tropile
relaxed
all
his
limbs
and
let
his
chin
rest
on
his
it
was
he
thought
with
placid
crystalline
perception
a
rare
and
perfect
opportunity
for
meditation
he
thought
of
connectivity
overhead
a
shifting
glassy
flaw
appeared
in
the
thin
still
air
there
was
any
thought
of
eyes
in
the
erased
palimpsest
that
was
glenn
tropile
mind
there
was
any
thought
of
pyramids
or
of
wolves
the
plowed
field
before
him
did
exist
even
the
water
merrily
bubbling
itself
dry
was
gone
from
his
perception
he
was
beginning
to
meditate
time
passed
or
stood
still
for
tropile
there
was
no
difference
there
was
no
time
he
found
himself
almost
on
the
brink
of
understanding
something
snapped
an
intruding
drone
maybe
or
a
twitching
muscle
partly
tropile
came
back
to
reality
almost
he
glanced
upward
almost
he
saw
the
eye
it
did
matter
the
thing
that
really
mattered
the
only
thing
in
the
world
was
all
within
his
mind
and
he
was
ready
he
knew
to
find
it
once
more
try
harder
he
let
the
unanswerable
question
drift
into
his
mind
the
sound
of
two
hands
together
is
a
clapping
what
is
the
sound
of
one
hand
gently
he
pawed
at
the
question
the
symbol
of
the
futility
of
mind
and
therefore
the
gateway
to
meditation
unawareness
of
self
was
stealing
deliciously
over
him
he
was
glenn
tropile
he
was
more
than
that
he
was
the
water
boiling
and
the
boiling
water
was
he
he
was
the
gentle
warmth
of
the
fire
which
was
which
was
yes
itself
the
arc
of
the
sky
as
each
thing
was
each
other
thing
water
was
fire
and
fire
air
tropile
was
the
first
simmering
bubble
and
the
full
roll
of
water
was
self
was
more
than
self
was
the
answer
to
the
unanswerable
question
was
coming
clearer
and
softer
to
him
and
then
all
at
once
but
not
suddenly
for
there
was
no
time
it
was
not
close
it
the
answer
was
his
was
him
the
arc
of
sky
was
the
answer
and
the
answer
belonged
to
sky
to
warmth
to
all
warmths
that
there
are
and
to
all
waters
and
and
the
answer
was
was
tropile
vanished
the
mild
thunderclap
that
followed
made
the
flames
dance
and
the
column
of
steam
fray
and
then
the
fire
was
steady
again
and
so
was
the
rising
steam
but
tropile
was
gone

haendl
plodded
angrily
through
the
high
grass
toward
the
dull
throb
of
the
diesel
maybe
it
had
been
a
mistake
to
take
this
glenn
tropile
into
the
colony
he
was
more
citizen
than
wolf
no
cancel
that
haendl
thought
he
was
more
wolf
than
citizen
but
the
wolf
in
him
was
tainted
with
blood
he
like
a
wolf
but
in
spite
of
everything
he
refused
to
give
up
some
of
his
sheep
ways
meditation
he
had
been
cautioned
against
that
but
had
he
given
it
up
he
had
not
if
it
had
been
entirely
up
to
haendl
glenn
tropile
would
have
found
himself
back
among
the
sheep
or
dead
fortunately
for
tropile
it
was
not
entirely
up
to
haendl
the
community
of
wolves
was
by
no
means
a
democracy
but
the
leader
had
a
certain
responsibility
to
his
constituents
and
the
responsibility
was
this
he
could
afford
to
be
wrong
like
the
old
gray
wolf
who
protected
mowgli
he
had
to
defend
his
actions
against
attack
if
he
failed
to
defend
the
pack
would
pull
him
down
and
innison
thought
they
needed
tropile
not
in
spite
of
the
taint
of
the
citizen
that
he
bore
but
because
of
it
haendl
bawled
tropile
tropile
where
are
you
there
was
only
the
wind
and
the
of
the
diesel
it
was
enormously
irritating
haendl
had
other
things
to
do
than
to
chase
after
glenn
tropile
and
where
was
he
there
was
the
diesel
idling
wastefully
there
the
end
of
the
patterned
furrows
tropile
had
plowed
there
a
small
fire
burning
and
there
was
tropile
haendl
stopped
frozen
his
mouth
opened
about
to
yell
tropile
name
it
was
tropile
all
right
staring
with
concentrated
gaze
at
the
fire
and
the
little
pot
of
water
it
boiled
staring
meditating
and
over
his
head
like
flawed
glass
in
a
pane
was
the
thing
haendl
feared
most
of
all
things
on
earth
it
was
an
eye
tropile
was
on
the
very
verge
of
being
translated
whatever
that
was
time
maybe
to
find
out
that
was
haendl
ducked
back
into
the
shelter
of
the
high
grass
knelt
plucked
his
radio
communicator
from
his
pocket
urgently
called
innison
innison
will
somebody
for
god
sake
put
innison
on
seconds
passed
voices
answered
then
there
was
innison
innison
listen
you
wanted
to
catch
tropile
in
the
act
of
meditation
all
right
you
got
him
the
old
wheat
field
south
end
under
the
elms
around
the
creek
get
here
fast
innison
there
an
eye
forming
above
him
luck
lucky
that
they
were
ready
for
this
and
only
by
luck
because
it
was
the
helicopter
that
innison
had
patiently
assembled
for
the
attack
on
everest
that
was
ready
now
loaded
with
instruments
planned
to
weigh
and
measure
the
aura
around
the
pyramid
now
at
hand
when
they
needed
it
that
was
luck
but
there
was
driving
hurry
involved
too
it
was
only
a
matter
of
minutes
before
haendl
heard
the
wobbling
drone
of
the
copter
saw
the
vanes
fluttering
low
over
the
hedges
dropping
to
earth
behind
the
elms
haendl
raised
himself
cautiously
and
peered
yes
tropile
was
still
there
and
the
eye
still
above
him
but
the
noise
of
the
helicopter
had
frayed
the
spell
tropile
stirred
the
eye
wavered
and
shook
but
did
not
vanish
thanking
what
passed
for
his
god
haendl
scuttled
circuitously
around
the
elms
and
joined
innison
at
the
copter
innison
was
furiously
closing
switches
and
pointing
lenses
they
saw
tropile
sitting
there
the
eye
growing
larger
and
closer
over
his
head
they
had
time
plenty
of
time
oh
nearly
a
minute
of
time
they
brought
to
bear
on
the
silent
and
unknowing
form
of
glenn
tropile
every
instrument
that
the
copter
carried
they
were
waiting
for
tropile
to
disappear
he
did
innison
and
haendl
hunched
at
the
thunderclap
as
air
rushed
in
to
replace
him
we
got
what
you
wanted
haendl
said
harshly
let
read
some
instruments
throughout
the
translation
magnetic
tape
on
a
madly
spinning
drum
had
been
hurtling
under
recording
heads
at
a
hundred
feet
a
second
output
to
the
recording
heads
had
been
from
every
kind
of
measuring
device
they
had
been
able
to
conceive
and
build
all
loaded
on
the
helicopter
for
use
on
mount
everest
all
now
pointed
directly
at
glenn
tropile
they
had
for
the
instant
of
translation
readings
from
one
microsecond
to
the
next
on
the
varying
electric
gravitational
magnetic
radiant
and
conditions
in
his
vicinity
they
got
back
to
innison
workshop
and
the
laboratory
inside
it
in
less
than
a
minute
but
it
took
hours
of
playing
back
the
magnetic
pulses
into
machines
that
turned
them
into
scribed
curves
on
coordinate
paper
before
innison
had
anything
resembling
an
answer
he
said
no
mystery
i
mean
no
mystery
except
the
speed
want
to
know
what
happened
to
tropile
i
do
said
haendl
a
pencil
of
electrostatic
force
maintained
by
a
pinch
effect
bounced
down
the
approximate
azimuth
of
everest
god
knows
how
they
handled
the
elevation
and
charged
him
and
the
area
positive
a
charge
clear
off
the
scale
they
parted
company
he
was
bounced
straight
up
a
meter
off
the
ground
a
correcting
vector
was
applied
when
last
seen
he
was
headed
fast
in
the
direction
of
the
pyramids
binary
fast
so
fast
that
i
would
guess
he
get
there
alive
it
takes
an
appreciable
time
a
good
part
of
a
second
for
his
protein
to
coagulate
enough
to
make
him
sick
and
then
kill
him
if
the
pyramids
strip
the
charges
off
him
immediately
on
arrival
as
i
should
think
they
will
he
live
friction
be
damned
to
friction
innison
said
calmly
he
carried
a
packet
of
air
with
him
and
there
no
friction
how
i
do
know
how
are
they
going
to
keep
him
alive
in
space
without
the
charges
that
hold
air
i
do
know
if
they
do
maintain
the
charges
can
they
beat
the
speed
of
light
i
do
know
i
can
tell
you
happened
i
ca
tell
you
haendl
stood
up
thoughtfully
it
something
he
said
grudgingly
it
more
than
we
ever
had
a
complete
reading
at
the
instant
of
translation
we
get
more
haendl
promised
innison
now
that
you
know
what
to
look
for
go
on
looking
for
it
keep
every
possible
detection
device
monitored
hours
a
day
turn
on
everything
you
got
that
find
a
sign
of
imposed
modulation
at
any
sign
or
at
hunch
that
there
be
a
sign
i
to
be
called
if
i
eating
if
i
sleeping
if
i
enjoying
with
a
woman
call
me
you
hear
maybe
you
were
right
about
tropile
maybe
he
did
have
some
use
he
might
give
the
pyramids
a
bellyache
innison
flipping
the
magnetic
tape
drum
to
rewind
said
thoughtfully
it
too
bad
they
got
him
we
could
have
used
some
more
readings
too
bad
haendl
laughed
sharply
this
time
they
got
themselves
a
wolf
the
pyramids
did
have
a
wolf
a
fact
which
did
not
matter
in
the
least
to
them
it
is
not
possible
to
know
what
mattered
to
a
pyramid
except
by
inference
but
it
is
possible
to
know
that
they
had
no
way
of
telling
wolf
from
citizen
the
planet
which
was
their
home
earth
old
moon
was
small
dark
atmosphereless
and
waterless
it
was
completely
built
over
much
of
it
with
its
propulsion
devices
in
the
old
days
when
technology
had
followed
war
luxury
government
and
leisure
the
pyramids
sun
had
run
out
of
steam
and
at
about
the
same
time
they
had
run
out
of
the
components
they
imported
from
a
neighboring
planet
they
used
the
last
of
their
components
to
implement
their
stolid
metaphysic
of
hauling
and
pushing
they
pushed
their
planet
they
knew
where
to
push
it
each
pyramid
as
it
stood
was
a
observatory
powerful
and
accurate
beyond
the
wildest
dreams
of
earthly
from
this
start
they
built
instruments
to
aid
their
naked
senses
they
went
into
a
kind
of
hibernation
reducing
their
activity
to
a
bare
trickle
except
for
a
small
crew
and
headed
for
earth
they
had
every
reason
to
believe
they
would
find
more
components
there
and
they
did
tropile
was
one
of
them
the
only
thing
which
set
him
apart
from
the
others
was
that
he
was
the
most
recent
to
be
stockpiled
the
religion
or
vice
or
philosophy
he
practiced
made
it
possible
for
him
to
be
a
component
meditation
derived
from
zen
buddhism
was
a
windfall
for
the
pyramids
though
of
course
they
had
no
idea
at
all
of
what
lay
behind
it
and
did
not
care
they
knew
only
that
at
certain
times
certain
potential
components
became
components
which
were
no
longer
merely
potential
which
were
in
fact
ripe
for
harvesting
it
was
useful
to
them
that
the
minds
they
cropped
were
utterly
blank
it
saved
the
trouble
of
blanking
them
tropile
had
been
harvested
at
the
moment
his
inhibiting
conscious
mind
had
been
cleared
for
the
pyramids
were
not
interested
in
him
as
an
entity
capable
of
will
and
conception
they
used
only
the
raw
capacity
of
the
human
brain
and
its
perceptors
they
used
rashevsky
number
the
gigantic
far
more
than
astronomical
expression
that
denoted
the
number
of
switching
operations
performable
within
the
human
brain
they
used
subception
the
phenomenon
by
which
the
reasoning
mind
uninhibited
by
consciousness
reacts
directly
to
stimuli
shortcutting
the
cerebral
censor
avoiding
the
weighing
of
that
precedes
every
conscious
act
the
harvested
minds
were
components
it
is
not
desirable
that
your
bedroom
wall
switch
have
a
mind
of
its
own
if
you
turn
the
lights
on
you
want
them
so
it
was
with
the
pyramids
a
component
was
needed
in
the
industrial
complex
which
transformed
catabolism
products
into
anabolism
products
with
long
experience
gained
since
their
planetfall
pyramids
received
the
that
was
glenn
tropile
he
arrived
in
one
piece
wearing
a
blanket
of
air
mentally
at
the
moment
of
inert
blankness
his
meditation
had
granted
him
the
psychic
coma
he
was
cushioned
on
repellent
charges
as
he
plummeted
down
and
instantly
stripped
of
surplus
electrostatic
charge
at
this
point
he
was
still
human
only
asleep
he
remained
asleep
annular
fields
they
used
for
lifting
and
lowering
seized
him
and
moved
him
into
a
snug
tank
of
nutrient
fluid
there
were
many
such
tanks
ready
and
waiting
the
tanks
themselves
could
be
moved
and
the
one
containing
glenn
tropile
did
move
to
a
metabolism
complex
where
there
were
many
other
tanks
all
occupied
this
was
a
warm
room
the
pyramids
had
wasted
no
energy
on
such
foppish
comforts
in
the
first
room
in
this
room
glenn
tropile
gradually
resumed
the
appearance
of
life
his
heart
once
again
began
to
beat
faint
stirrings
were
visible
in
his
chest
as
his
lungs
attempted
to
breathe
gradually
the
stirrings
slowed
and
stopped
there
was
no
need
for
that
foppish
comfort
either
the
nutrient
fluid
supplied
all
tropile
was
wired
into
circuit
the
only
literal
wiring
at
first
was
a
temporary
one
a
fine
electrode
aseptically
introduced
into
the
great
nerve
that
leads
to
the
rhinencephalon
the
small
brain
the
area
of
the
brain
which
contains
the
pleasure
centers
that
motivate
human
behavior
more
than
a
thousand
components
had
been
spoiled
and
discarded
before
the
pyramids
had
located
the
pleasure
centers
so
exactly
while
the
component
tropile
was
being
programmed
the
wire
rewarded
him
with
minute
pulses
that
made
his
body
glow
with
animal
satisfaction
when
he
functioned
correctly
that
was
all
there
was
to
it
after
a
time
the
wire
was
withdrawn
but
by
then
tropile
had
learned
his
entire
task
conditioned
reflexes
had
been
established
they
could
be
counted
on
for
the
long
and
useful
life
of
the
component
that
life
might
be
very
long
indeed
in
the
nutrient
tank
beside
tropile
as
it
happened
lay
a
component
with
eight
legs
and
a
chitinous
fringe
around
its
eyes
it
had
lain
in
such
a
tank
for
more
than
a
hundred
and
thousand
terrestrial
years
the
component
was
placed
in
operation
it
opened
its
eyes
and
saw
things
the
sensory
nerves
of
its
limbs
felt
things
the
muscles
of
its
hands
and
toes
operated
things
where
was
glenn
tropile
he
was
there
all
of
him
but
a
bereft
of
will
emptied
of
memories
he
was
a
machine
and
part
of
a
huger
machine
his
sex
was
the
sex
of
a
photoelectric
cell
his
politics
were
those
of
a
transistor
his
ambition
that
of
a
mercury
switch
he
did
know
anything
about
sex
or
fear
or
hope
he
only
knew
two
things
input
and
output
input
to
him
was
a
display
of
small
lights
on
a
board
before
his
vacant
face
and
also
the
modulation
of
a
loudspeaker
hum
in
each
ear
output
from
him
was
the
dancing
manipulation
of
certain
buttons
and
keys
prompted
by
changes
in
input
and
by
nothing
else
between
input
and
output
he
lay
in
the
tank
a
human
black
box
which
was
capable
of
rashevsky
number
of
switchings
and
of
nothing
else
he
had
been
programmed
to
accomplish
a
specific
task
to
shepherd
a
chemical
called
acid
present
in
the
catabolic
product
of
the
pyramids
through
a
succession
of
more
than
five
hundred
separate
operations
until
it
emerged
as
the
chemical
which
the
pyramids
were
able
to
metabolize
called
protoporphin
ix
he
was
not
the
only
component
operating
in
this
task
there
were
several
each
with
its
own
program
the
acid
accumulated
in
great
tanks
a
mile
from
him
he
knew
its
concentration
heat
and
pressure
he
knew
of
all
the
impurities
which
would
affect
subsequent
reactions
his
fingers
tapped
giving
signals
to
sluice
gates
to
open
for
so
many
seconds
and
then
to
close
for
such
an
amount
of
solvent
at
such
a
temperature
to
flow
in
for
the
agitators
to
agitate
for
just
so
long
at
just
such
a
force
and
if
a
trouble
signal
disturbed
any
one
of
the
major
and
minor
operations
he
it
was
set
to
decide
among
alternatives
scrap
the
batch
in
view
of
flow
conditions
along
the
line
isolate
and
bypass
the
batch
through
a
standby
loop
immediate
action
to
correct
the
malfunction
without
inhibiting
intelligence
without
the
trammels
of
humanity
on
him
the
intricate
display
board
and
the
complex
modulations
of
the
two
sound
signals
could
be
instantly
taken
in
evaluated
and
given
their
share
in
the
decision
was
it
he
still
alive
the
question
has
no
meaning
it
was
working
it
was
an
excellent
machine
in
fact
and
the
pyramids
cared
for
it
well
its
only
consciousness
apart
from
the
reflexive
responses
that
were
its
program
was
well
call
it
the
sound
of
one
hand
alone
which
is
to
say
zero
mindlessness
samadhi
stupor
it
continued
to
function
for
some
time
until
the
required
supply
of
protoporphin
ix
had
been
exceeded
by
a
sufficient
factor
of
safety
to
make
further
processing
unnecessary
that
is
for
some
minutes
or
months
during
that
time
it
was
happy
it
had
been
programmed
to
be
happy
when
there
were
no
uncorrected
malfunctions
of
the
process
at
the
end
of
that
time
it
shut
itself
off
sent
out
a
signal
that
the
task
was
completed
then
it
was
laid
aside
in
the
analogue
of
a
to
be
reprogrammed
when
another
component
was
needed
it
was
totally
immaterial
to
the
pyramids
that
this
particular
component
had
not
been
stamped
from
citizen
but
from
wolf
ix
roget
germyn
of
wheeling
a
citizen
contemplated
his
wife
with
growing
concern
possibly
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
had
unhinged
her
reason
but
he
was
nearly
sure
that
she
had
eaten
a
portion
of
the
evening
meal
secretly
in
the
serving
room
before
calling
him
to
the
table
he
felt
positive
that
it
was
only
a
temporary
aberration
she
was
after
all
a
citizeness
with
all
that
that
implied
a
a
creature
like
that
gala
tropile
for
example
someone
like
that
might
steal
extra
portions
with
craft
and
guile
you
could
live
with
a
wolf
for
years
and
not
have
some
of
it
rub
off
on
you
but
not
citizeness
germyn
there
was
a
light
tap
on
the
door
speak
of
the
devil
thought
roget
germyn
most
appropriately
for
it
was
that
same
gala
tropile
she
entered
her
head
downcast
looking
worn
and
well
pretty
he
began
formally
i
give
you
greeting
citi
they
here
she
interrupted
in
desperate
haste
germyn
blinked
please
she
begged
ca
you
do
something
they
citizeness
germyn
emitted
a
muted
shriek
you
may
leave
citizeness
germyn
told
her
shortly
already
forming
in
his
mind
the
words
of
gentle
reproof
he
would
later
use
now
what
is
all
this
talk
of
wolves
gala
tropile
distractedly
sat
in
the
chair
her
hostess
had
vacated
we
were
running
away
she
babbled
glenn
he
was
wolf
you
see
and
he
made
me
leave
with
him
after
the
house
of
the
five
regulations
we
were
a
day
long
march
from
wheeling
and
we
stopped
to
rest
and
there
was
an
aircraft
citizen
an
aircraft
citizen
germyn
allowed
himself
a
frown
citizeness
it
is
not
well
to
invent
things
which
are
not
so
i
saw
it
citizen
there
were
men
in
it
one
of
them
is
here
again
he
came
looking
for
me
with
another
man
and
i
barely
escaped
him
afraid
there
is
no
cause
for
fear
only
an
opportunity
to
appreciate
citizen
germyn
said
mechanically
it
was
what
one
told
one
children
but
within
himself
he
was
finding
it
very
hard
to
remain
calm
that
word
wolf
it
was
a
destroyer
of
calm
an
incitement
to
panic
and
hatred
he
remembered
tropile
well
and
there
was
wolf
to
be
sure
the
mere
fact
that
citizen
germyn
had
doubted
his
wolfishness
at
first
was
powerful
cause
to
be
doubly
convinced
of
it
now
he
had
postponed
the
day
of
reckoning
for
an
enemy
of
all
the
world
and
there
was
enough
secret
guilt
in
his
recollection
to
set
his
own
heart
thumping
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
said
citizen
germyn
in
words
that
the
stress
of
emotion
had
already
made
far
less
than
graceful
obediently
gala
tropile
said
i
was
returning
to
my
home
after
the
evening
meal
and
citizeness
puffin
she
took
me
in
after
citizen
tropile
after
my
husband
was
i
understand
you
made
your
home
with
her
yes
she
told
me
that
two
men
had
come
to
see
me
they
spoke
badly
she
said
and
i
was
alarmed
i
peered
through
a
window
of
my
home
and
they
were
there
one
had
been
in
the
aircraft
i
saw
and
they
flew
away
with
my
husband
it
is
a
matter
of
seriousness
citizen
germyn
admitted
doubtfully
so
then
you
came
here
to
me
yes
but
they
saw
me
citizen
and
i
think
they
followed
you
must
protect
me
i
have
no
one
else
if
they
be
wolf
germyn
said
calmly
we
will
raise
hue
and
cry
against
them
now
will
the
citizeness
remain
here
i
go
forth
to
see
these
men
there
was
a
graceless
hammering
on
the
door
too
late
cried
gala
tropile
in
panic
they
are
here
citizen
germyn
went
through
the
ritual
of
greeting
of
deprecating
the
ugliness
and
poverty
of
his
home
of
offering
everything
he
owned
to
his
visitors
it
was
the
way
to
greet
a
stranger
the
two
men
lacked
both
courtesy
and
wit
but
they
did
make
an
attempt
to
comply
with
the
minimal
formal
customs
of
introduction
he
had
to
give
them
credit
for
that
and
yet
it
was
almost
more
alarming
than
if
they
had
blustered
and
yelled
for
he
knew
one
of
these
men
he
dredged
the
name
out
of
his
memory
it
was
haendl
the
same
man
had
appeared
in
wheeling
the
day
glenn
tropile
had
been
scheduled
to
make
the
donation
of
the
spinal
tap
and
had
broken
free
and
escaped
he
had
inquired
about
tropile
of
a
good
many
people
citizen
germyn
included
and
even
at
that
time
in
the
excitement
of
an
amok
a
and
a
translation
in
a
single
day
germyn
had
wondered
at
haendl
lack
of
breeding
and
airs
now
he
wondered
no
longer
but
the
man
made
no
overt
act
and
citizen
germyn
postponed
the
raising
of
the
hue
and
cry
it
was
not
a
thing
to
be
done
lightly
gala
tropile
is
in
this
house
the
man
with
haendl
said
bluntly
citizen
germyn
managed
a
quirked
smile
we
want
to
see
her
germyn
it
about
her
husband
he
uh
he
was
with
us
for
a
while
and
something
happened
ah
yes
the
wolf
the
man
flushed
and
looked
at
haendl
haendl
said
loudly
the
wolf
sure
he
a
wolf
but
he
gone
now
so
you
do
have
to
worry
about
that
gone
not
just
him
but
four
or
five
of
us
there
was
a
man
named
innison
and
he
gone
too
we
need
help
germyn
something
about
tropile
god
knows
how
it
is
but
he
started
something
we
want
to
talk
to
his
wife
and
find
out
what
we
can
about
him
so
will
you
get
her
out
of
the
back
room
where
she
hiding
and
bring
her
here
please
citizen
germyn
quivered
he
bent
over
the
id
bracelet
that
once
had
belonged
to
the
one
pfc
joe
hartman
fingering
it
to
hide
his
thoughts
he
said
at
last
perhaps
you
are
right
perhaps
the
citizeness
is
with
my
wife
if
this
be
so
would
it
not
be
possible
that
she
is
fearful
of
those
who
once
were
with
her
husband
haendl
laughed
sourly
she
is
any
more
fearful
than
we
are
germyn
i
told
you
about
this
man
innison
who
disappeared
he
was
a
son
of
the
wolf
you
understand
me
for
that
matter
he
glanced
at
his
companion
licked
his
lips
and
changed
his
mind
about
what
he
had
been
going
to
say
next
he
was
a
wolf
do
you
ever
remember
hearing
of
a
wolf
being
translated
before
translated
germyn
dropped
the
id
bracelet
but
that
impossible
he
cried
forgetting
his
manners
completely
oh
no
translation
comes
only
to
those
who
attain
the
moment
of
supreme
detachment
you
can
be
sure
of
that
i
i
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
no
wolf
could
at
least
five
wolves
did
haendl
said
grimly
now
you
see
what
the
trouble
is
tropile
was
translated
i
saw
that
with
own
eyes
the
next
day
innison
within
a
week
two
or
three
others
so
we
came
down
here
germyn
not
because
we
like
you
people
not
because
we
enjoy
it
but
because
we
what
we
want
is
to
talk
to
tropile
wife
you
too
i
guess
we
want
to
talk
to
anybody
who
ever
knew
him
we
want
to
find
out
everything
there
is
to
find
out
about
tropile
and
see
if
we
can
make
any
sense
of
the
answers
because
maybe
translation
is
the
supreme
objective
of
life
to
you
people
germyn
but
to
us
it
just
one
more
way
of
dying
and
we
do
want
to
die
citizen
germyn
bent
to
pick
up
his
cherished
identification
bracelet
and
dropped
it
absently
on
a
table
there
was
very
much
on
his
mind
he
said
at
last
that
is
strange
shall
i
tell
you
another
strange
thing
haendl
looking
angry
and
baffled
nodded
germyn
said
there
has
been
no
translation
here
since
the
day
the
wolf
tropile
escaped
but
there
have
been
eyes
i
have
seen
them
myself
it
he
hesitated
shrugged
it
has
been
disturbing
some
of
our
finest
citizens
have
ceased
to
meditate
they
have
been
worrying
so
many
eyes
and
nobody
taken
it
is
outside
of
all
of
our
experience
and
our
customs
have
suffered
politeness
is
dwindling
among
us
even
in
my
own
household
he
coughed
and
went
on
no
matter
but
these
eyes
have
come
into
every
home
they
have
peered
about
peered
about
and
no
one
has
been
taken
why
is
it
something
to
do
with
the
translation
of
wolves
he
stared
hopelessly
at
his
visitors
all
i
know
is
that
it
is
very
strange
and
therefore
i
am
worried
then
take
us
to
gala
tropile
said
haendl
let
see
what
we
can
find
out
citizen
germyn
bowed
he
cleared
his
throat
and
raised
his
voice
just
sufficiently
to
carry
from
one
room
to
another
citizeness
he
called
there
was
a
pause
and
then
his
wife
appeared
in
the
doorway
looking
ruffled
and
ill
at
ease
with
her
guest
will
you
ask
if
citizeness
tropile
will
join
us
here
he
requested
his
wife
nodded
she
is
resting
i
will
call
her
they
called
her
and
questioned
her
for
some
time
she
told
them
nothing
she
had
nothing
to
tell
x
on
earth
binary
glenn
tropile
had
been
reprogrammed
for
a
new
task
the
problem
was
navigation
earth
had
been
a
disappointment
to
the
pyramids
it
was
necessary
to
move
rapidly
to
a
more
rewarding
planet
the
pyramids
had
taken
earth
out
past
pluto
orbit
with
a
simple
shove
slow
and
massive
it
had
been
enough
merely
to
approximate
the
direction
in
which
they
would
want
to
go
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
for
refinements
of
course
later
but
now
the
time
for
refinements
had
come
earlier
than
they
might
have
expected
they
had
now
time
to
travel
they
knew
where
to
a
star
cluster
reasonably
sure
to
be
rich
in
componentiferous
planets
it
was
inherent
in
the
nature
of
component
mines
that
eventually
they
always
played
out
there
were
always
more
mines
though
if
that
had
not
been
so
it
would
have
been
necessary
perhaps
to
components
against
future
needs
but
it
was
easier
to
work
the
vein
out
and
move
on
now
the
course
had
to
be
computed
there
were
such
variables
to
be
considered
as
motion
of
the
star
cluster
acceleration
of
the
system
influence
of
every
astronomical
object
in
the
island
universe
without
precise
computation
on
this
basis
was
obviously
not
practical
that
was
not
an
answer
to
the
problem
since
the
time
required
would
approach
eternity
as
one
of
its
parameters
it
was
possible
to
simplify
the
problem
only
the
astronomical
bodies
which
were
relatively
nearby
need
be
treated
as
individuals
farther
away
the
pyramids
began
to
group
them
in
small
bunches
still
farther
in
large
bunches
on
to
the
point
where
the
farthest
and
the
most
numerous
bodies
were
lumped
together
as
a
vague
gravitational
noise
whose
average
intensity
alone
it
was
required
to
know
and
to
enter
as
a
datum
and
still
no
single
component
could
handle
even
its
own
share
of
the
problem
were
the
computer
they
formed
to
be
kept
within
the
range
of
permissible
size
it
was
for
this
that
the
component
which
had
once
been
tropile
was
taken
out
of
storage
this
was
all
old
stuff
to
the
pyramids
they
knew
how
to
handle
it
they
broke
the
problem
down
to
its
essentials
separated
even
those
into
many
parts
there
was
for
example
the
subsection
of
one
certain
aspect
of
the
logistical
problem
which
involved
locating
and
procuring
additional
components
to
handle
the
load
even
that
tiny
specialization
was
too
much
for
a
single
component
but
fortunately
the
pyramids
had
resources
to
bring
to
bear
the
procedure
in
such
cases
was
to
hitch
several
components
together
this
was
done
when
the
pyramids
finished
their
there
floated
in
an
oversized
nutrient
tank
a
thing
like
a
great
it
was
composed
of
eight
components
all
human
as
it
happened
arranged
in
a
circle
facing
inward
joined
temple
to
temple
brain
to
brain
at
their
feet
where
sixteen
eyes
could
see
it
was
the
display
board
to
feed
them
their
input
sixteen
hands
each
grasped
a
molded
switch
to
handle
their
output
there
would
be
no
storage
of
the
output
outside
of
the
complex
itself
it
went
as
control
signals
to
the
electrostatic
generators
funneled
through
the
single
pyramid
on
mount
everest
which
handled
the
task
of
that
is
of
translation
the
programming
was
slow
and
thorough
perhaps
the
pyramid
which
finally
activated
the
octuple
unit
and
went
away
was
pleased
with
itself
not
knowing
that
one
of
its
components
was
glenn
tropile
nirvana
it
pervaded
all
there
was
nothing
outside
of
it
nirvana
glenn
tropile
floated
in
it
as
in
the
amniotic
fluid
around
him
nirvana
the
sound
of
one
hand
floating
oneness
there
was
an
intrusion
perfection
is
completed
by
adding
to
it
it
is
destroyed
struck
like
a
thunderbolt
oneness
for
glenn
tropile
it
seemed
as
though
his
wife
were
screaming
at
him
to
wake
up
he
tried
to
it
was
curiously
difficult
and
painful
timeless
poignant
sadness
five
years
of
sorrow
over
a
lost
love
compressed
into
a
microsecond
it
was
always
so
tropile
thought
drowsily
awakening
it
never
lasts
the
use
of
worrying
over
what
always
happens
sudden
shock
and
horror
rocked
him
was
no
ordinary
awakening
no
ordinary
thing
at
all
was
as
it
ever
had
been
before
tropile
opened
his
mouth
and
screamed
or
thought
he
did
but
there
was
only
a
hoarse
faint
flutter
in
his
eardrums
it
was
a
moment
when
sanity
might
have
gone
but
there
was
one
curious
mundane
fact
that
saved
him
he
was
holding
something
in
his
hands
he
found
that
he
could
look
at
it
and
it
was
a
switch
a
molded
switch
mounted
on
a
board
and
he
was
holding
one
in
each
hand
it
was
little
to
cling
to
but
it
at
least
was
real
if
his
hands
could
be
holding
something
then
there
must
be
some
reality
somewhere
tropile
closed
his
eyes
and
managed
to
open
them
again
yes
there
was
reality
too
he
closed
his
eyes
and
light
stopped
he
opened
them
and
light
returned
then
perhaps
he
was
not
dead
as
he
had
thought
carefully
stumbling
his
mind
his
only
usable
tool
he
tried
to
make
an
estimate
of
his
surroundings
he
could
hardly
believe
what
he
found
item
he
could
scarcely
move
somehow
he
was
bound
by
his
feet
and
his
head
how
he
could
tell
item
he
was
bent
over
and
he
could
straighten
why
again
he
could
tell
but
it
was
a
fact
the
great
erecting
muscles
of
his
back
answered
his
command
but
his
body
would
not
move
item
his
eyes
saw
but
only
in
a
small
area
he
could
move
his
head
either
still
he
could
see
a
few
things
the
switch
in
his
hand
his
feet
a
sort
of
display
of
lights
on
a
strangely
circular
board
the
lights
flickered
and
changed
their
pattern
without
thinking
he
moved
a
switch
why
because
it
was
to
move
that
switch
when
a
certain
light
flared
green
a
certain
switch
had
to
be
thrown
why
well
when
a
certain
light
flared
green
a
certain
switch
he
abandoned
that
problem
never
mind
why
what
the
devil
was
going
glenn
tropile
squinted
about
him
like
a
mollusc
peering
out
of
its
shell
there
was
another
fact
the
oddness
of
the
seeing
what
makes
it
look
so
queer
he
asked
himself
he
found
an
answer
but
it
required
some
time
to
take
it
in
he
was
seeing
in
a
strange
perspective
one
looks
out
of
two
eyes
close
one
eye
and
the
world
is
flat
open
it
again
and
there
is
a
stereoscopic
double
the
saliencies
of
the
picture
leap
forward
the
background
retreats
so
with
the
lights
on
the
board
no
not
exactly
but
something
that
he
thought
it
was
as
though
he
squinted
and
strained
well
as
though
he
had
never
really
before
as
though
for
all
his
life
he
had
had
only
one
eye
and
now
he
had
strangely
been
given
two
his
visual
perception
of
the
board
was
he
could
see
all
of
it
at
once
it
had
no
front
or
back
it
was
in
the
round
the
natural
thinking
of
it
was
without
orientation
he
engulfed
and
comprehended
it
as
a
unit
it
had
no
secrets
of
shadow
or
silhouette
i
think
tropile
mouthed
slowly
to
himself
that
i
going
crazy
but
that
was
no
explanation
either
mere
insanity
did
account
for
what
he
saw
then
he
asked
himself
was
he
in
a
state
that
was
nirvana
he
remembered
with
an
odd
flash
of
guilt
that
he
had
been
meditating
watching
the
stages
of
boiling
water
all
right
perhaps
he
had
been
translated
but
what
was
this
then
were
the
meditators
wrong
in
teaching
that
nirvana
was
the
end
and
yet
righter
than
the
wolves
who
dismissed
meditation
as
a
phenomenon
wholly
inside
the
skull
and
refused
to
discuss
translation
at
all
that
was
a
question
for
which
he
could
find
nothing
approaching
an
answer
he
turned
away
from
it
and
looked
at
his
hands
he
could
see
them
too
in
the
round
he
noted
he
could
see
every
wrinkle
and
pore
in
all
sixteen
of
them
hands
that
was
the
other
moment
when
sanity
might
have
gone
he
closed
his
eyes
sixteen
eyes
no
wonder
the
total
perception
and
after
a
while
he
opened
them
again
the
hands
were
there
all
sixteen
of
them
cautiously
tropile
selected
a
finger
that
seemed
familiar
in
his
memory
after
a
moment
thought
he
flexed
it
it
bent
he
selected
another
another
on
a
different
hand
this
time
he
could
use
any
or
all
of
the
sixteen
hands
they
were
all
his
all
sixteen
of
them
i
appear
thought
tropile
crazily
to
be
a
sort
of
snowflake
each
of
my
branches
is
a
human
body
he
stirred
and
added
another
datum
i
appear
also
to
be
in
a
tank
of
fluid
and
yet
i
do
not
drown
there
were
certain
deductions
to
be
made
from
that
either
someone
the
pyramids
had
done
something
to
his
lungs
or
else
the
fluid
was
as
good
an
oxygenating
medium
as
air
or
both
suddenly
a
burst
of
twinkled
on
the
board
below
him
instantly
and
involuntarily
his
sixteen
hands
began
working
the
switches
transmitting
complex
directions
in
a
lightninglike
stream
of
clicks
tropile
relaxed
and
let
it
happen
he
had
no
choice
the
power
that
made
it
to
respond
to
the
board
made
it
impossible
for
his
brain
to
concentrate
while
the
response
was
going
on
perhaps
he
thought
drowsily
he
would
never
have
awakened
at
all
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
long
period
with
no
lights
but
he
was
awake
and
his
consciousness
began
to
explore
as
the
task
ended
he
had
had
an
opportunity
to
understand
something
of
what
was
happening
he
understood
that
he
was
now
a
part
of
something
larger
than
himself
beyond
doubt
something
which
served
and
belonged
to
the
pyramids
his
single
brain
not
being
large
enough
for
the
job
seven
others
had
been
hooked
in
with
it
but
where
were
their
personalities
gone
he
supposed
presumably
they
had
been
citizens
sons
of
the
wolf
did
not
meditate
and
therefore
were
not
translated
except
for
himself
he
corrected
wryly
remembering
the
meditation
on
rainclouds
that
had
led
him
to
no
wait
not
rainclouds
but
water
tropile
caught
hold
of
himself
and
forced
his
mind
to
retrace
that
thought
he
the
raincloud
meditation
it
had
been
prompted
by
a
particularly
noble
cumulus
of
the
ancient
ship
type
and
this
was
odd
tropile
had
never
been
deeply
interested
in
rainclouds
had
never
known
even
the
secondary
classifications
of
raincloud
types
and
he
that
the
ancient
ship
was
of
the
fourth
order
of
categories
it
was
a
false
memory
was
not
therefore
logically
it
was
someone
else
memory
and
being
available
to
his
own
mind
as
the
fourteen
other
hands
and
eyes
were
available
it
must
belong
to
another
branch
of
the
snowflake
he
turned
his
eyes
down
and
tried
to
see
which
of
the
branches
was
his
old
body
he
found
it
quickly
with
growing
excitement
there
was
the
left
great
toe
of
his
body
he
had
injured
it
in
boyhood
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
way
it
was
bent
good
it
was
reassuring
he
tried
to
feel
the
one
particular
body
that
led
to
that
familiar
toe
he
succeeded
though
not
easily
after
a
time
he
became
more
aware
of
body
somewhat
as
a
neurotic
may
become
stomach
conscious
or
heart
conscious
but
this
was
no
neurosis
it
was
an
intentional
exploration
since
that
worked
with
some
uneasiness
he
transferred
his
attention
to
another
pair
of
feet
and
thought
his
way
up
from
them
it
was
embarrassing
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
knew
what
it
felt
like
to
have
breasts
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
knew
what
it
was
like
to
have
one
internal
organs
quite
differently
shaped
and
arranged
buttressed
and
stressed
by
different
muscles
the
very
faint
background
feel
of
man
internal
arrangements
never
questioned
unless
something
goes
wrong
with
them
and
they
start
to
hurt
was
not
at
all
like
the
faint
background
feel
that
a
woman
has
inside
her
and
when
he
concentrated
on
that
feel
it
was
no
faint
background
to
him
it
was
surprising
and
upsetting
he
withdrew
his
attention
hoping
that
he
would
be
able
to
gratefully
he
became
conscious
of
his
own
body
again
he
was
still
if
he
chose
to
be
were
the
other
seven
still
themselves
he
reached
into
his
mind
all
of
it
all
eight
separate
intelligences
that
were
combined
within
him
is
anybody
there
he
demanded
no
answer
or
nothing
he
could
recognize
as
an
answer
he
drove
harder
and
there
still
was
none
it
was
annoying
he
resented
it
as
bitterly
he
remembered
as
in
the
old
days
when
he
had
first
been
learning
the
subtleties
of
ruin
appreciation
there
had
been
a
ruin
master
his
name
forgotten
who
had
been
sometimes
less
than
courteous
had
driven
hard
another
false
memory
he
withdrew
and
weighed
it
perhaps
he
thought
that
was
a
part
of
the
answer
these
people
these
other
seven
would
not
be
driven
the
attempt
to
call
them
back
to
consciousness
would
have
to
be
delicate
when
he
drove
hard
it
was
painful
he
remembered
the
instant
violent
agony
of
his
own
awakening
and
they
reacted
with
anguish
more
gently
alert
for
vagrant
memories
he
combed
the
depths
of
the
eightfold
mind
within
him
reaching
into
the
sleeping
portions
touching
handling
sifting
and
associating
sorting
this
memory
of
an
old
knife
wound
from
an
amok
that
was
not
the
raincloud
woman
it
was
a
man
very
aged
this
faint
recollection
of
a
childhood
fear
of
drowning
was
that
she
it
was
it
fitted
with
this
other
recollection
the
long
detour
on
the
road
south
toward
the
sun
around
a
river
the
raincloud
woman
was
the
first
to
round
out
in
his
mind
and
the
first
he
communicated
with
he
was
not
surprised
to
find
that
early
in
her
life
she
had
feared
that
she
might
be
wolf
he
reached
out
for
her
it
was
almost
magic
knowing
the
secret
name
of
a
person
so
that
then
he
was
yours
to
command
but
the
secret
name
was
more
than
that
it
was
the
gestalt
of
the
person
it
was
the
sum
of
all
data
and
experience
never
available
to
another
person
until
now
with
her
memories
arranged
at
last
in
his
own
mind
he
thought
persuasively
citizeness
alla
narova
will
you
awaken
and
speak
with
me
no
answer
only
a
vague
troubled
stirring
gently
he
persisted
i
know
you
well
alla
narova
you
sometimes
thought
you
might
be
a
daughter
of
the
wolf
but
never
really
believed
it
because
you
knew
you
loved
your
husband
and
thought
wolves
did
not
love
you
loved
rainclouds
too
it
was
when
you
stood
at
beachy
head
and
saw
a
great
cumulus
that
you
went
into
meditation
and
on
and
on
many
times
coaxingly
even
so
it
was
not
easy
but
at
last
he
began
to
reach
her
slowly
she
began
to
surface
thoughts
faintly
sounded
in
his
mind
like
echoes
at
first
his
own
thoughts
bouncing
back
at
him
a
sort
of
mental
nod
of
agreement
yes
that
is
so
then
terror
with
a
shaking
fear
a
hysterical
rush
citizeness
alla
narova
came
violently
up
to
full
consciousness
and
to
panic
she
was
soundlessly
screaming
the
whole
figure
quivered
and
twisted
in
its
nutrient
bath
the
terrible
storm
raged
in
tropile
own
mind
as
fully
as
in
hers
but
he
had
the
advantage
of
knowing
what
it
was
he
helped
her
he
fought
it
for
the
two
of
them
soothing
explaining
calming
at
last
her
branch
of
the
retreated
sobbing
for
a
spell
the
storm
was
over
he
talked
to
her
in
his
mind
and
she
listened
she
was
incredulous
but
there
was
no
choice
for
her
she
to
believe
exhausted
and
passive
she
asked
finally
what
can
we
do
i
wish
i
were
dead
he
told
her
you
were
never
a
coward
before
remember
alla
narova
i
you
as
nobody
has
ever
known
another
human
being
before
the
way
you
will
know
me
as
for
what
we
can
do
we
must
begin
by
waking
the
others
if
we
can
if
not
if
not
tropile
replied
grimly
then
we
will
think
of
something
else
she
was
of
tough
stuff
he
thought
admiringly
when
she
had
rested
and
absorbed
things
her
spirit
was
almost
that
of
a
wolf
she
had
very
nearly
been
right
about
herself
together
they
explored
their
twinned
members
they
found
through
them
exactly
what
task
was
theirs
to
do
they
found
how
the
electrostatic
harvesting
scythe
of
the
pyramids
was
controlled
by
and
through
them
they
found
what
limitations
there
were
and
what
freedoms
they
owned
they
reached
into
the
other
petals
of
the
snowflake
reached
past
the
linked
components
into
the
whole
complex
of
electrostatic
field
generators
and
propulsion
machinery
reached
even
past
that
into
into
the
great
single
function
of
the
pyramids
that
lay
beyond
xi
haendl
was
on
the
ragged
edge
of
breakdown
which
was
something
new
in
his
life
it
was
full
hot
summer
and
the
hidden
colony
of
wolves
in
princeton
should
have
been
full
of
energy
and
life
the
crops
were
growing
on
all
the
fields
nearby
the
drained
storehouses
were
being
replenished
the
aircraft
that
had
been
so
painfully
rebuilt
and
fitted
for
the
assault
on
mount
everest
were
standing
by
ready
to
be
manned
and
to
take
off
and
nothing
absolutely
nothing
was
going
right
it
looked
as
though
there
would
no
expedition
to
everest
four
times
now
haendl
had
gathered
his
forces
and
been
all
ready
four
times
a
key
man
of
the
expedition
had
vanished
wolves
did
vanish
and
yet
more
than
a
score
of
them
had
first
tropile
then
innison
then
two
dozen
more
by
ones
and
twos
no
one
was
immune
take
innison
for
example
there
was
a
man
who
was
wolf
through
and
through
he
was
a
doer
not
a
thinker
his
skills
were
the
skills
of
an
artisan
a
tinkerer
a
jackleg
mechanic
how
could
a
man
like
that
succumb
to
the
pallid
lure
of
meditation
but
undeniably
he
had
it
had
reached
a
point
where
haendl
himself
was
and
jumpy
he
had
set
curious
alarms
for
himself
had
enlisted
the
help
of
others
of
the
colony
to
avert
the
danger
of
translation
from
himself
when
he
went
to
bed
at
night
a
lieutenant
sat
next
to
his
bed
watchfully
alert
lest
haendl
in
that
moment
of
reverie
before
sleep
fell
into
meditation
and
himself
be
translated
there
was
no
hour
of
the
day
when
haendl
permitted
himself
to
be
alone
and
his
companions
or
guards
were
ordered
to
shake
him
awake
as
violently
as
need
be
at
the
first
hint
of
an
abstracted
look
in
the
eyes
or
a
reflective
cast
of
the
features
as
time
went
on
haendl
regime
of
constant
alertness
began
to
cost
him
heavily
in
lost
rest
and
sleep
and
the
consequences
of
that
were
more
and
more
occasions
when
the
bodyguards
shook
him
awake
less
and
less
rest
he
was
very
close
to
breakdown
indeed
on
a
hot
wet
morning
a
few
days
after
his
useless
expedition
to
see
citizen
germyn
in
wheeling
haendl
ate
a
tasteless
breakfast
and
reeling
with
fatigue
set
out
on
a
tour
of
inspection
of
princeton
warm
rain
dripped
from
low
clouds
but
that
was
merely
one
more
annoyance
to
haendl
he
hardly
noticed
it
there
were
upward
of
a
thousand
wolves
in
the
community
and
there
were
signs
of
worry
on
the
face
of
every
one
of
them
haendl
was
not
the
only
man
in
princeton
who
had
begun
laying
traps
for
himself
as
a
result
of
the
unprecedented
disappearances
he
was
not
the
only
one
who
was
short
of
sleep
when
one
member
in
forty
disappears
the
morale
of
the
whole
community
receives
a
shattering
blow
to
haendl
it
was
clear
looking
into
the
faces
of
his
compatriots
that
not
only
was
it
going
to
be
nearly
impossible
to
mount
the
planned
assault
on
the
pyramid
on
everest
this
year
it
was
going
to
be
unbearably
difficult
merely
to
keep
the
community
going
the
whole
wolf
pack
was
on
the
verge
of
panic
there
was
a
confused
shouting
behind
haendl
groggily
he
turned
and
looked
half
a
dozen
wolves
were
yelling
and
pointing
at
something
in
the
wet
muggy
air
it
was
an
eye
hanging
silent
and
featureless
over
the
center
of
the
street
haendl
took
a
deep
breath
and
mustered
command
of
himself
frampton
he
ordered
one
of
his
lieutenants
get
the
helicopter
with
the
instruments
here
we
take
some
more
readings
frampton
opened
his
mouth
then
looked
more
closely
at
haendl
and
instead
began
to
talk
on
his
pocket
radio
haendl
knew
what
was
in
the
man
mind
it
was
in
his
own
too
what
was
the
use
of
more
readings
from
the
time
of
translation
on
they
had
had
a
superfluity
of
instrument
readings
on
the
forces
and
auras
that
surrounded
the
eyes
yes
and
on
translations
themselves
too
before
tropile
there
had
never
been
an
eye
seen
in
princeton
much
less
an
actual
translation
but
things
were
different
now
everything
was
different
eyes
roamed
restlessly
around
day
and
night
some
of
the
men
nearest
the
eye
were
picking
up
rocks
and
throwing
them
at
the
bobbing
vortex
in
the
air
haendl
started
to
yell
at
them
to
stop
then
changed
his
mind
the
eye
did
seem
to
be
affected
as
he
watched
one
of
the
men
scored
a
direct
hit
with
a
cobblestone
the
stone
went
right
through
the
eye
without
sound
or
effect
why
not
let
them
work
off
some
of
their
fears
in
direct
action
there
was
a
fluttering
of
vanes
and
the
copter
with
the
instruments
mounted
on
it
came
down
in
the
middle
of
the
street
between
haendl
and
the
eye
it
was
all
very
rapid
from
then
on
the
eye
swooped
toward
haendl
he
could
help
it
he
ducked
that
was
useless
but
it
was
also
unnecessary
for
he
saw
in
a
second
that
it
was
only
partly
the
motion
of
the
eye
toward
him
that
made
it
loom
larger
it
was
also
that
the
eye
itself
was
growing
an
eye
was
perhaps
the
size
of
a
football
as
near
as
anyone
could
judge
this
one
got
bigger
bigger
it
was
the
size
of
a
roc
egg
the
size
of
a
whale
blunt
head
it
stopped
and
hovered
over
the
helicopter
while
the
man
inside
frantically
pointed
lenses
and
meters
thundercrash
not
a
man
this
time
translation
had
gone
beyond
men
the
whole
helicopter
vanished
man
instruments
spinning
vanes
and
all
haendl
picked
himself
up
sweating
shocked
beyond
sleepiness
the
young
man
named
frampton
said
fearfully
haendl
what
do
we
do
now
do
haendl
stared
at
him
absently
why
kill
ourselves
i
guess
he
nodded
soberly
as
though
he
had
at
last
attained
the
solution
of
a
difficult
problem
then
he
sighed
well
one
thing
before
that
he
said
i
going
to
wheeling
we
wolves
are
licked
maybe
the
citizens
can
help
us
now
roget
germyn
of
wheeling
a
citizen
received
the
message
in
the
chambers
that
served
him
as
a
place
of
business
he
had
a
visitor
waiting
for
him
at
home
germyn
was
still
citizen
and
he
could
not
quickly
break
off
the
pleasant
and
interminable
discussion
he
was
having
with
a
prospective
client
over
a
potential
business
arrangement
he
apologized
for
the
interruption
caused
by
the
message
the
conventional
five
times
listened
while
his
guest
explained
once
more
the
plan
he
had
come
to
propose
in
full
then
turned
his
cupped
hands
toward
himself
in
the
gesture
of
denial
of
adequacy
it
was
the
closest
he
could
come
to
saying
no
on
the
other
side
of
the
desk
the
citizen
who
had
come
to
propose
an
investment
scheme
immediately
changed
the
subject
by
inviting
germyn
and
his
citizeness
to
a
sirius
viewing
the
invitation
in
the
form
of
rhymed
couplets
he
had
wanted
to
transact
his
business
very
much
but
he
could
germyn
got
out
of
the
invitation
by
a
conditional
acceptance
in
proper
form
and
the
man
left
delayed
only
slightly
by
the
four
urgings
to
stay
almost
immediately
germyn
dismissed
his
clerk
and
closed
his
office
for
the
day
by
tying
a
triple
knot
in
a
length
of
red
cord
across
the
open
door
when
he
got
to
his
home
he
found
as
he
had
suspected
that
the
visitor
was
haendl
there
was
much
doubt
in
citizen
germyn
mind
about
haendl
the
man
had
nearly
admitted
to
being
wolf
and
how
could
a
citizen
overlook
that
but
in
the
excitement
of
gala
tropile
translation
there
had
been
no
hue
and
cry
germyn
had
permitted
the
man
to
leave
and
now
he
reserved
judgment
he
found
haendl
distastefully
sipping
tea
in
the
living
room
and
attempting
to
keep
up
a
formal
conversation
with
citizeness
germyn
he
rescued
him
took
him
aside
closed
a
door
and
waited
he
was
astonished
at
the
change
in
the
man
before
haendl
had
been
bouncy
aggressive
the
very
qualities
least
desired
in
a
citizen
the
mark
of
the
son
of
the
wolf
now
he
was
none
of
these
things
but
he
looked
no
more
like
a
citizen
for
all
that
he
was
haggard
tense
he
said
with
an
absolute
minimum
of
protocol
germyn
the
last
time
i
saw
you
there
was
a
translation
gala
tropile
remember
i
remember
citizen
germyn
said
remember
it
had
hardly
left
his
thoughts
and
you
told
me
there
had
been
others
are
they
still
going
on
germyn
said
there
have
been
others
he
was
trying
to
speak
directly
to
match
this
man
haendl
speed
and
forcefulness
it
was
hardly
good
manners
but
it
had
occurred
to
citizen
germyn
that
there
were
times
when
manners
after
all
were
not
the
most
important
thing
in
the
world
there
were
two
in
the
past
few
days
one
was
a
woman
citizeness
baird
her
husband
a
teacher
she
was
viewing
through
glass
with
four
or
five
other
women
at
the
time
she
just
disappeared
she
was
looking
through
a
green
prism
at
the
time
if
that
helps
i
do
know
if
it
helps
or
not
who
was
the
other
one
germyn
shrugged
a
man
named
harmane
no
one
saw
it
but
they
heard
the
thunderclap
or
something
like
a
thunderclap
and
he
was
missing
he
thought
for
a
moment
it
is
a
little
unusual
i
suppose
two
in
a
week
haendl
said
roughly
listen
germyn
it
is
just
two
in
the
past
thirty
days
within
the
area
around
here
and
in
other
there
have
been
at
least
fifty
in
places
do
you
understand
here
and
in
princeton
the
rest
of
the
world
nothing
much
a
few
translations
here
and
there
but
just
in
these
two
communities
fifty
does
that
make
sense
citizen
germyn
no
no
and
i
tell
you
something
else
three
of
the
well
victims
have
been
children
under
the
age
of
five
one
was
too
young
to
walk
and
the
most
recent
translation
was
a
person
at
all
it
was
a
helicopter
now
figure
that
out
germyn
what
the
explanation
for
translations
germyn
was
gaping
why
you
meditate
you
know
on
connectivity
the
idea
is
that
once
you
grasped
the
essential
connectivity
of
all
things
you
become
one
with
the
cosmic
whole
but
i
do
see
how
a
baby
or
a
machine
no
of
course
you
do
remember
glenn
tropile
naturally
he
the
link
haendl
said
grimly
when
he
got
translated
we
thought
it
was
a
big
help
because
he
had
the
consideration
to
do
it
right
under
our
eyes
we
got
enough
readings
to
give
us
a
clue
as
to
what
physically
speaking
translation
is
all
about
that
was
the
first
real
clue
and
we
thought
he
done
us
a
favor
now
i
not
so
sure
he
leaned
forward
every
person
i
know
of
who
was
translated
was
someone
tropile
knew
the
three
kids
were
in
his
class
at
the
nursery
school
we
put
him
there
for
a
while
to
keep
him
busy
when
he
first
came
to
us
two
of
the
men
he
bunked
with
are
gone
the
mess
boy
who
served
him
is
gone
his
wife
is
gone
meditation
no
germyn
i
know
most
of
those
people
not
a
damned
one
of
them
would
have
spent
a
moment
meditating
on
connectivity
to
save
his
life
and
what
do
you
make
of
that
swallowing
hard
germyn
said
i
just
remembered
that
man
harmane
what
about
him
the
one
who
was
translated
last
week
he
also
knew
tropile
he
was
the
keeper
of
the
house
of
the
five
regulations
when
tropile
was
there
you
see
and
i
bet
the
woman
knew
tropile
too
haendl
got
up
fretfully
pacing
around
here
the
thing
germyn
i
licked
you
know
what
i
am
do
you
germyn
said
levelly
i
believe
you
to
be
wolf
you
believe
right
that
does
matter
any
more
you
do
like
wolves
well
i
do
like
you
but
this
thing
is
too
big
for
me
to
care
about
that
any
more
tropile
has
started
something
happening
and
what
the
end
of
it
is
going
to
be
i
ca
tell
but
i
know
this
we
not
safe
either
of
us
maybe
you
still
think
translation
is
a
fulfillment
i
do
it
scares
me
it
going
to
happen
to
and
to
you
it
going
to
happen
to
everybody
who
ever
had
anything
to
do
with
glenn
tropile
unless
we
can
somehow
stop
it
and
i
do
know
how
will
you
help
me
germyn
trying
not
to
tremble
when
all
his
buried
fears
screamed
said
honestly
i
have
to
sleep
on
it
haendl
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
then
he
shrugged
almost
to
himself
he
said
maybe
it
does
matter
maybe
we
ca
do
anything
about
it
anyhow
all
right
i
come
back
in
the
morning
and
if
you
made
up
your
mind
to
help
we
start
trying
to
make
plans
and
if
you
made
up
your
mind
the
other
way
well
i
guess
i
have
to
fight
off
a
few
citizens
not
that
i
mind
that
germyn
stood
up
and
bowed
he
began
the
ritual
four
urgings
spare
me
that
haendl
growled
meanwhile
germyn
if
i
were
you
i
would
make
any
plans
you
may
not
be
here
to
carry
them
out
germyn
asked
thoughtfully
and
if
you
were
i
not
making
any
haendl
said
grimly
citizen
germyn
feeling
utterly
tainted
with
the
scent
of
the
wolf
in
his
home
tossed
in
his
bed
sleepless
his
eyes
were
wide
open
staring
at
the
dark
ceiling
he
could
hear
his
wife
decorous
breathing
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
soft
and
regular
it
should
have
been
lulling
him
to
sleep
it
was
not
sleep
was
very
far
away
germyn
was
a
brave
enough
man
as
courage
is
measured
among
citizens
that
is
to
say
he
had
never
been
afraid
though
it
was
true
that
there
had
been
very
little
occasion
but
he
was
afraid
now
he
did
want
to
be
translated
the
wolf
haendl
had
put
his
finger
on
it
you
still
think
translation
is
a
translation
the
reward
of
meditation
the
gift
bestowed
on
only
a
handful
of
gloriously
transfigured
persons
that
was
one
thing
but
the
sort
of
translation
that
was
now
involved
was
nothing
like
that
not
if
it
happened
to
children
not
if
it
happened
to
gala
tropile
not
if
it
happened
to
a
machine
and
glenn
tropile
was
involved
in
it
germyn
turned
restlessly
if
people
who
knew
glenn
tropile
were
likely
to
be
translated
and
people
who
meditated
on
connectivity
were
likely
to
be
translated
then
people
who
knew
glenn
tropile
and
did
want
to
be
translated
had
better
not
meditate
on
connectivity
it
was
very
difficult
to
think
of
connectivity
endlessly
he
calculated
sums
in
arithmetic
in
his
mind
recited
the
five
regulations
composed
greeting
poems
and
verses
on
viewing
and
endlessly
he
kept
coming
back
to
tropile
to
translation
to
connectivity
he
did
to
be
translated
but
still
the
thought
had
a
certain
lure
what
was
it
like
did
it
hurt
well
probably
not
he
speculated
it
was
very
fast
according
to
haendl
report
if
you
could
believe
what
an
admitted
son
of
the
wolf
reported
but
germyn
had
to
well
if
it
was
fast
at
that
kind
of
speed
he
thought
perhaps
you
would
die
instantly
maybe
tropile
was
dead
was
that
possible
no
it
did
seem
so
after
all
there
was
the
fact
of
the
connection
between
tropile
and
so
many
of
the
recently
translated
what
was
the
connection
there
or
generalizing
what
connections
were
involved
in
he
rescued
himself
from
the
dread
word
and
summoned
up
the
first
image
that
came
to
mind
it
happened
to
be
tropile
wife
gala
tropile
who
had
disappeared
herself
in
this
very
room
gala
tropile
he
stuck
close
to
the
thought
of
her
a
little
pleased
with
himself
that
was
the
trick
of
thinking
of
connectivity
to
think
so
hard
and
fully
of
something
else
as
to
leave
no
room
in
the
mind
for
the
unwanted
thought
he
pictured
every
line
of
her
face
every
wave
of
her
stringy
hair
it
was
very
easy
that
way
he
was
pleased
xii
on
mount
everest
the
sullen
stream
of
responses
that
was
mind
to
the
pyramid
had
taken
note
of
a
new
input
signal
it
was
not
a
critical
mind
its
only
curiosity
was
a
restless
urge
to
and
there
was
no
about
what
to
it
was
perhaps
the
analogue
of
a
man
hunger
pang
the
input
signal
said
it
obeyed
call
it
craving
for
a
new
flavor
where
once
it
had
patiently
waited
for
the
state
that
citizens
knew
as
meditation
on
connectivity
and
the
pyramid
itself
perhaps
knew
as
a
stage
of
ripeness
in
the
fruits
of
its
wristwatch
mine
now
it
wanted
a
different
taste
unripe
overripe
at
any
rate
different
accordingly
the
wheep
wheep
changed
in
tempo
and
in
key
and
the
bouncing
echoes
changed
and
there
was
a
ripe
one
to
be
plucked
its
name
was
innison
and
there
another
gala
tropile
and
another
another
oh
many
others
a
babe
from
tropile
nursery
school
and
the
wheeling
jailer
and
a
woman
tropile
once
had
coveted
on
the
street
once
the
ruddy
mark
of
ripeness
had
been
what
human
beings
called
meditation
on
connectivity
and
the
pyramids
knew
as
a
convenient
blankness
now
the
sign
was
a
sort
of
empathy
with
the
component
named
tropile
it
did
matter
to
the
pyramid
on
mount
everest
it
swung
its
electrostatic
scythe
and
the
call
them
tropiletropes
were
harvested
it
did
not
occur
to
the
pyramid
on
mount
everest
that
a
component
might
be
directing
its
actions
how
could
it
perhaps
the
pyramid
on
mount
everest
wondered
if
it
knew
how
to
wonder
when
it
noticed
that
different
criteria
were
involved
in
selecting
components
these
days
if
it
knew
how
to
notice
surely
even
a
pyramid
might
wonder
when
without
warning
or
explanation
its
orders
were
changed
not
merely
to
harvest
a
different
sort
of
component
but
to
drag
along
with
the
needful
parts
a
clanking
assortment
of
machinery
and
metal
as
began
to
happen
machines
why
would
the
pyramids
need
to
translate
machines
but
why
on
the
other
hand
would
a
pyramid
bother
to
question
a
directive
even
if
it
were
able
to
in
any
case
it
did
it
swung
its
scythe
and
gathered
in
what
it
was
caused
to
gather
in
men
sometimes
eat
green
fruit
and
come
to
regret
it
was
it
the
same
with
pyramids
and
citizen
germyn
fell
into
the
unsuspected
trap
avoiding
connectivity
he
thought
of
glenn
tropile
and
the
unfelt
pulses
found
him
out
he
did
see
the
eye
that
formed
above
him
he
did
feel
the
gathering
of
forces
that
formed
his
trap
he
did
know
that
he
was
seized
charged
catapulted
through
space
caught
halted
and
drained
it
happened
too
fast
one
moment
he
was
in
his
bed
the
next
moment
he
was
elsewhere
there
was
anything
in
between
it
had
happened
to
hundreds
of
thousands
of
components
before
him
but
for
citizen
germyn
what
happened
was
in
some
ways
different
he
was
not
embalmed
in
nutrient
fluid
formed
and
programmed
to
take
his
part
in
the
for
he
had
not
been
selected
by
the
pyramid
but
by
that
single
wild
component
tropile
he
arrived
conscious
awake
and
able
to
move
he
stood
up
in
a
chamber
vast
thundering
crashes
of
metal
buffeted
his
ears
heat
sprang
little
founts
of
perspiration
on
his
skin
it
was
too
much
too
much
to
take
in
at
once
madmen
naked
were
capering
and
shouting
at
him
it
took
him
a
moment
to
realize
that
they
were
not
devils
this
was
not
hell
he
was
not
dead
this
way
they
were
bawling
at
him
come
on
hurry
it
up
he
reeled
following
their
directions
across
an
unpleasantly
warm
floor
staggering
and
falling
the
binary
planet
was
a
quarter
denser
than
earth
until
he
got
his
balance
the
capering
madmen
led
him
through
a
door
or
sphincter
or
trap
it
was
not
like
anything
he
had
ever
seen
but
it
was
a
portal
of
a
sort
and
on
the
other
side
of
it
was
something
closer
to
sanity
it
was
another
room
and
though
the
light
was
still
red
it
was
a
paler
calmer
red
and
the
thundering
ironmongery
was
a
wall
away
the
madmen
were
naked
yes
but
they
were
not
mad
the
oil
on
their
skins
was
only
the
sheen
of
sweat
where
where
am
i
he
gasped
two
voices
perhaps
three
or
four
were
all
talking
at
once
he
could
make
no
sense
of
it
citizen
germyn
looked
about
him
he
was
in
a
sort
of
chamber
that
formed
a
part
of
a
machine
that
existed
for
the
unknown
purposes
of
the
pyramids
on
the
binary
planet
and
he
was
alive
and
not
even
alone
he
had
crossed
more
than
a
million
miles
of
space
without
feeling
a
thing
but
when
what
the
naked
men
were
saying
began
to
penetrate
the
walls
lurched
around
him
it
was
true
he
had
been
translated
he
looked
dazedly
down
at
his
own
bare
body
and
around
at
the
room
and
then
he
realized
they
were
still
talking
when
you
get
your
bearings
feel
all
right
now
come
on
citizen
snap
out
of
it
germyn
blinked
another
voice
said
peevishly
tropile
got
to
find
some
other
place
to
bring
them
in
that
foundry
is
meant
for
human
beings
look
at
the
shape
this
one
is
in
some
time
somebody
going
to
come
in
and
we
wo
spot
him
in
time
and
pfut
the
first
voice
said
ca
be
helped
hey
are
you
all
right
citizen
germyn
looked
at
the
naked
man
in
front
of
him
and
took
a
deep
breath
of
hot
sour
air
of
course
i
all
right
he
said
the
naked
man
was
haendl
the
said
to
the
alla
got
another
one
it
citizen
germyn
the
petal
fluttered
feebly
in
soundless
laughter
the
alla
said
glenn
come
back
the
whole
just
went
out
of
circuit
tropile
pulled
his
attention
away
from
his
human
acquisitions
in
the
chamber
off
the
foundry
and
allowed
himself
to
fuse
with
the
together
they
reached
out
and
explored
along
the
pathways
they
had
laboriously
traced
the
was
the
complex
of
drive
generators
units
that
their
own
unit
had
been
originally
part
of
until
glenn
tropile
by
waking
its
components
had
managed
to
divert
it
for
purposes
of
his
own
the
two
of
them
reached
out
into
it
dead
end
it
was
out
of

had
said
one
whole
limb
of
their
body
their
new
jointly
tenanted
body
that
spanned
a
whole
planet
and
reached
across
space
to
earth
had
been
lopped
off
quick
quick
they
separated
traced
separate
paths
they
came
together
again
still
dead
end
the
dyad
that
was
tropile
and
the
woman
reached
out
to
touch
the
others
in
the
snowflake
and
communicated
not
in
words
not
in
anything
as
slow
and
as
opaque
as
words
pyramids
have
lopped
off
another
the
compound
personality
of
the
snowflake
considered
its
course
of
action
reached
its
decision
acted
quick
quick
three
of
the
other
members
of
the
snowflake
darted
out
of
the
collective
unit
and
went
about
isolating
and
tracing
the
exact
area
that
had
been
affected
tropile
we
expected
this
they
could
help
noticing
sooner
or
later
that
something
was
going
wrong
alla
narova
but
glenn
suppose
they
cut
out
of
circuit
stuck
here
we
ca
move
we
ca
get
out
of
the
tanks
if
they
know
that
we
are
the
source
of
their
trouble
tropile
let
them
know
that
what
we
got
the
others
here
for
he
was
cocky
now
fighting
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
free
to
fight
to
let
his
wolf
blood
strive
to
the
utmost
and
he
knew
what
he
was
fighting
for
this
was
a
matter
of
pitiful
tanks
and
carbines
against
the
invulnerable
pyramids
this
was
the
invulnerability
of
the
whole
pyramid
system
turned
against
the
pyramids
it
was
a
warning
the
fact
that
the
pyramids
had
become
alert
to
danger
had
begun
cutting
sections
of
their
planetary
communications
system
out
of
the
main
circuit
but
as
a
warning
it
did
frighten
tropile
it
only
spurred
him
to
action
quick
quick
he
and
the
dissolved
sped
away
figuratively
they
sought
out
the
most
restive
components
they
could
find
shook
them
by
the
shoulder
tried
to
wake
them
actually
well
what
is
actually
the
physical
fact
was
surely
that
they
move
at
all
for
they
were
bound
to
their
tank
and
to
the
surgical
joinings
each
to
each
at
their
temples
no
crawling
child
in
a
playpen
was
more
helplessly
confined
than
tropile
and
alla
narova
and
the
others
and
yet
no
human
being
had
ever
been
more
free
regard
that
imbecile
servant
of
everyman
the
thermostat
he
runs
the
furnace
in
everyman
house
he
measures
the
doneness
of
everyman
breakfast
toast
he
valves
the
cooling
fluid
through
the
radiator
of
everyman
car
if
everyman
house
stays
too
hot
or
too
cold
the
man
swears
at
the
lackwit
switch
and
maybe
buys
a
new
one
to
plug
in
but
he
never
never
thinks
that
his
thermostat
might
be
plotting
against
him
thermostat
man
man
pyramid
only
that
and
nothing
more
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
a
pyramid
to
think
that
its
components
once
installed
could
reprogram
themselves
no
component
ever
had
but
before
glenn
tropile
no
component
had
been
wolf
when
tropile
found
himself
he
found
others
they
were
men
and
women
real
persons
with
gonads
and
dreams
they
had
been
caught
at
the
moment
of
blankness
yes
and
frozen
into
that
shape
true
but
they
were
palimpsest
personalities
on
which
the
pyramids
had
programmed
their
duties
underneath
the
pyramids
cabalistic
scrawl
the
men
and
women
still
remained
they
had
only
to
be
reached
tropile
and
alla
narova
reached
them
one
at
a
time
then
by
scores
the
pyramids
made
that
possible
the
network
of
communication
that
they
had
created
for
their
own
purposes
encompassed
every
cell
of
the
race
and
all
its
works
tropile
reached
out
from
his
floating
snowflake
and
went
where
he
wished
anywhere
within
the
binary
planet
to
the
brooding
pyramid
on
earth
through
the
eyes
wherever
he
chose
on
earth
surface
physically
he
was
scarcely
able
to
move
a
muscle
but
oh
the
soaring
range
of
his
mind
and
vision
citizen
germyn
was
past
shock
but
just
the
same
it
was
uncomfortable
to
be
in
a
room
with
several
dozen
other
persons
all
of
them
naked
uncomfortable
once
it
would
have
been
for
a
citizen
to
see
his
own
citizeness
unclothed
was
gross
lechery
to
be
part
of
a
mixed
and
group
was
unthinkable
or
had
been
now
it
only
made
him
uneasy
he
said
numbly
to
haendl
citizen
i
pray
you
tell
me
what
sort
of
place
this
is
later
said
haendl
gruffly
and
led
him
out
of
the
way
stay
put
he
advised
we
busy
and
that
was
true
something
was
going
on
but
citizen
germyn
make
out
exactly
what
it
was
the
naked
people
were
worrying
out
a
distribution
of
some
sort
of
supplies
there
were
tools
and
there
were
also
what
looked
to
citizen
germyn
unsophisticated
eyes
very
much
like
guns
guns
it
was
foolishness
to
think
they
were
guns
citizen
germyn
told
himself
strongly
had
guns
he
touched
the
floor
with
an
exploratory
hand
it
was
warm
and
it
shook
with
a
nameless
distant
vibration
he
shuddered
haendl
came
back
yes
they
were
guns
haendl
was
carrying
one
ours
he
crowed
that
tropile
must
looted
our
armory
at
princeton
by
the
looks
of
what
here
i
doubt
if
he
left
a
single
round
of
ammunition
what
the
hell
they
more
use
here
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
haendl
looked
at
him
with
savage
amusement
shoot
citizen
germyn
said
please
citizen
tell
me
what
this
is
all
about
haendl
sat
down
next
to
him
on
the
warm
quivering
floor
and
began
fitting
cartridges
into
a
clip
we
fighting
he
explained
gleefully
tropile
did
it
all
been
shanghaied
and
so
have
all
the
rest
of
us
tropile
alive
part
of
the
pyramid
communications
network
do
ask
me
how
but
there
and
he
has
been
hauling
men
and
weapons
and
god
knows
what
all
up
from
earth
you
on
the
binary
planet
now
you
know
and
we
going
to
bust
things
up
so
the
pyramids
will
be
able
to
put
them
back
together
again
understand
well
it
does
matter
if
you
do
all
you
have
to
understand
is
that
when
i
tell
you
to
shoot
this
gun
you
shoot
numbly
citizen
germyn
took
the
unfamiliar
stock
and
barrel
into
his
hands
muscles
he
had
forgotten
he
owned
straightened
the
limp
curve
of
his
back
squared
his
shoulders
and
thrust
out
his
chest
it
had
been
many
generations
since
any
of
citizen
germyn
people
had
known
the
feeling
of
being
an
armed
man
a
naked
woman
with
wild
hair
and
a
full
soft
figure
came
toward
them
jiggling
in
a
way
that
agonized
citizen
germyn
he
dropped
his
eyes
to
his
gun
and
kept
them
there
she
cried
orders
from
tropile
we
got
to
form
a
party
and
blow
something
up
haendl
demanded
such
as
what
i
do
know
what
i
only
know
where
we
got
a
guide
and
tropile
particularly
asked
for
you
haendl
he
said
you
enjoy
it
and
enjoy
it
haendl
did
anticipation
was
all
over
his
face
they
formed
a
party
of
a
dozen
they
armed
themselves
with
the
guns
tropile
had
levitated
from
the
bulging
warehouse
at
princeton
they
supplied
themselves
with
gray
metal
cans
of
something
that
haendl
said
were
explosives
and
with
fuses
and
detonators
to
match
and
they
set
off
with
their
guide
a
guide
it
was
a
shambling
fearsome
monster
when
citizen
germyn
saw
it
he
had
to
fight
an
almost
irresistible
temptation
to
be
ill
even
the
bare
skins
about
him
no
longer
mattered
this
new
horror
canceled
them
out
what
what
he
strangled
pointing
haendl
laughed
raucously
that
joey
what
joey
he
works
for
us
said
haendl
grinning
joey
was
neither
human
nor
beast
it
was
not
pyramid
it
was
nothing
citizen
germyn
had
ever
seen
or
imagined
before
it
crouched
on
limbs
and
even
so
was
twice
the
height
of
a
man
its
ropy
arms
and
legs
were
covered
with
fine
chitinous
spines
laid
on
as
close
as
hairs
in
a
pelt
and
sharp
as
thorns
there
was
a
layer
of
chitin
around
its
reddish
eyes
what
was
more
horrible
than
all
it
spoke
it
said
squeakily
you
all
ready
come
on
snap
it
up
the
pyramids
have
got
something
big
building
up
and
we
got
to
squash
it
citizen
germyn
whispered
feverishly
to
haendl
that
voice
it
sounds
odd
yes
but
is
it
tropile
voice
sure
it
is
that
what
old
joey
is
good
for
said
haendl
tropile
says
he
telepathic
whatever
that
is
makes
it
handy
for
us
and
it
did
telepathy
was
the
alien
very
special
use
to
glenn
tropile
for
what
joey
was
in
fact
was
another
component
from
a
previous
wristwatch
mine
joey
planet
had
once
circled
a
star
never
visible
from
earth
his
home
air
was
thin
and
his
home
sunlight
was
weak
and
in
consequence
his
race
had
developed
a
species
of
telepathy
for
communicating
at
long
range
this
was
handy
for
the
pyramids
because
it
simplified
the
wiring
and
it
was
equally
handy
for
glenn
tropile
once
he
managed
to
wake
the
creature
with
its
permission
he
could
use
its
body
as
a
sort
of
in
directing
the
tactics
of
his
shanghaied
army
that
permission
was
very
readily
given
joey
remembered
what
the
pyramids
had
done
to
its
own
planet
come
on
ordered
joey
in
tropile
filtered
voice
and
they
hastened
through
a
straight
and
achingly
cramped
tunnel
in
single
file
toward
what
tropile
had
said
was
their
target
they
had
nearly
reached
it
when
abruptly
there
was
a
thundering
of
explosions
ahead
the
party
stopped
looked
at
each
other
and
got
ready
to
move
on
more
slowly
at
last
it
had
started
the
pyramids
were
beginning
to
fight
back
xiii
citizeness
roget
germyn
widow
woke
from
sleep
like
a
cat
on
the
narrow
lower
third
of
the
bed
that
her
training
had
taught
her
to
occupy
though
it
had
been
some
days
since
her
translation
had
emptied
the
citizen
permanently
someone
had
tapped
gently
on
her
door
i
am
awake
she
called
in
a
voice
just
sufficient
to
carry
a
quiet
voice
said
citizeness
there
is
exceptional
opportunity
to
appreciate
this
morning
come
see
if
you
will
and
i
ask
forgiveness
for
waking
you
she
recognized
the
voice
it
was
the
wife
of
one
of
her
neighbors
the
citizeness
made
the
appropriate
reply
combining
forgiveness
and
gratitude
she
dressed
rapidly
but
with
appropriate
pauses
for
reflection
and
calm
and
stepped
out
into
the
street
it
was
not
yet
daylight
overhead
great
sheets
of
soundless
lightnings
flared
inside
citizeness
germyn
emotions
stirred
there
was
something
that
was
very
like
terror
and
something
that
was
akin
to
love
this
was
a
generation
that
had
never
seen
the
aurora
for
the
ricocheting
electron
beams
that
cause
it
could
not
span
the
increasing
distance
between
the
orphaned
earth
and
its
primary
old
sol
and
the
small
rekindled
suns
the
pyramids
made
were
far
too
puny
under
the
sleeting
aurora
small
knots
of
citizens
stood
about
the
streets
their
faces
turned
up
to
the
sky
and
illuminated
by
the
distant
light
it
was
truly
an
exceptional
opportunity
to
appreciate
and
they
were
all
making
the
most
of
it
conscientiously
citizeness
germyn
sought
out
another
viewer
with
whom
to
exchange
comments
on
the
spectacle
above
it
is
more
bright
than
meteors
she
said
judiciously
and
lovelier
than
the
freshly
kindled
sun
sure
said
the
woman
citizeness
germyn
jolted
looked
more
closely
it
was
the
tropile
woman
gala
was
that
her
name
and
what
sort
of
name
was
but
it
fitted
her
well
she
was
the
one
who
had
been
wife
to
wolf
and
more
likely
than
not
part
wolf
herself
still
the
case
was
not
proved
citizeness
germyn
said
honestly
i
have
never
seen
a
sight
to
compare
with
this
in
all
my
life
gala
tropile
said
indifferently
yeah
funny
things
are
happening
all
the
time
these
days
have
you
noticed
ever
since
glenn
turned
out
to
be
she
stopped
citizeness
germyn
rapidly
diagnosed
her
embarrassment
and
acted
to
cover
it
up
that
is
so
i
have
seen
eyes
a
hundred
times
and
yet
has
there
been
a
translation
with
the
eyes
no
but
there
have
been
translations
it
is
queer
i
suppose
so
gala
tropile
said
looking
upward
at
the
display
she
sighed
over
their
heads
a
formed
eye
was
drifting
slowly
about
but
neither
of
the
women
noticed
it
the
shifting
lights
in
the
sky
obscured
it
i
wonder
what
causes
that
stuff
gala
tropile
said
idly
citizeness
germyn
made
no
attempt
to
answer
it
was
not
the
sort
of
question
that
would
normally
have
occurred
to
her
and
therefore
not
a
sort
to
which
she
could
reply
moreover
it
was
not
the
question
closest
to
gala
tropile
heart
at
that
moment
nor
for
that
matter
the
question
closest
to
citizeness
germyn
the
question
that
underlay
the
thoughts
of
both
was
wonder
what
happened
to
my
it
was
strange
but
true
that
the
answers
to
all
their
questions
were
very
nearly
the
same
the
mind
said
sharply
glenn
come
back
tropile
withdrew
from
scanning
the
distant
dark
street
he
laughed
soundlessly
i
was
watching
my
wife
god
we
giving
them
fits
down
there
the
pyramids
must
be
churning
things
up
too
the
sky
is
full
of
auroral
displays
looks
like
there
plenty
of
bouncing
around
the
atmosphere
pay
attention
the
mind
commanded
all
right
obediently
tropile
returned
to
the
war
he
was
waging
it
was
a
strange
conflict
strangely
fought
tropile
mind
searched
the
abysses
and
tunnels
of
the
pyramid
planet
and
what
he
sensed
or
saw
was
immediately
communicated
to
all
of
the
awakened
components
who
were
his
allies
it
was
a
godlike
position
was
he
sane
there
was
no
knowing
sanity
no
longer
meant
anything
to
tropile
he
was
beyond
such
human
affairs
as
lunacy
or
its
reverse
an
insane
man
is
one
who
is
out
of
joint
with
his
environment
tropile
was
himself
his
environment
his
mind
encompassed
two
planets
and
the
space
between
he
saw
with
a
thousand
eyes
he
worked
with
a
thousand
hands
and
he
struck
mighty
blows
the
weakness
of
a
network
that
reaches
everywhere
is
that
it
is
everywhere
vulnerable
if
a
teletype
repeater
in
omaha
garbles
a
single
digit
printing
units
in
atlanta
and
bangor
will
type
out
errors
tropile
by
striking
at
the
pyramids
net
at
a
thousand
points
garbled
their
communications
and
made
them
nearly
useless
more
he
took
the
pyramid
network
for
his
own
the
sped
through
the
neurone
guides
of
the
pyramid
net
and
what
it
encountered
it
mastered
and
what
it
mastered
it
changed
the
pyramids
discovered
that
they
had
been
attacked
frantically
if
they
felt
frenzy
the
pyramids
replaced
components
the
woke
the
new
ones
unbelievingly
did
they
know
how
to
believe
the
pyramids
isolated
contaminated
circuits
the
bypassed
them
desperately
or
joyously
or
uffishly
one
term
fits
exactly
as
well
as
another
the
pyramids
returned
to
and
there
was
much
destruction
and
some
components
died
but
by
then
the
components
had
reprogrammed
themselves
the
first
job
had
been
the
matter
of
finding
hands
for
the
to
work
with
bring
hands
in
then
tropile
commanded
the
pyramids
network
and
obediently
it
was
done
the
translation
mechanism
the
electrostatic
scythe
that
had
harvested
so
many
crops
from
the
wristwatch
mines
suffered
a
change
and
went
to
work
not
for
the
pickers
but
for
the
fruit
the
essential
change
in
the
operation
of
that
particular
pneuma
had
been
simple
first
to
harvest
or
translate
the
men
and
women
tropile
wanted
as
fighters
instead
of
the
meditative
citizen
kind
second
to
divert
the
new
arrivals
to
where
they
would
not
go
straight
to
it
happened
that
the
only
alternate
space
tropile
could
find
was
a
sort
of
foundry
that
was
nearly
hell
but
that
was
only
a
detail
the
important
thing
was
that
new
helpers
were
arriving
with
minds
of
their
own
and
the
capacity
to
move
and
act
then
tropile
needed
to
communicate
with
them
he
found
the
alien
component
whose
name
vaguely
approached
joey
limited
sense
of
telepathy
was
needed
and
so
with
enormous
difficulty
tropile
and
alla
narova
combined
managed
to
reach
and
wake
it
and
so
he
had
an
army
captured
humans
for
troops
an
awakened
joey
for
liaison
tropile
was
lord
of
two
worlds
not
only
the
pyramids
were
under
his
thumb
but
his
own
fellow
humans
whom
he
had
drafted
into
his
service
they
ate
when
a
captured
circuit
he
controlled
fed
synthetic
mush
into
troughs
for
them
they
breathed
because
a
captured
circuit
he
directed
created
air
they
would
return
to
earth
when
and
only
when
a
captured
circuit
he
operated
sent
them
home
sane
by
what
standards
and
what
difference
did
it
make
xiv
with
a
series
of
grinding
shocks
like
an
enormous
relieving
a
strain
the
pyramids
began
to
fight
back
tropile
the
mind
called
urgently
tropile
flashed
to
the
trouble
spot
through
eyes
that
were
not
his
own
tropile
scanned
the
honeycombed
world
of
the
pyramids
there
was
an
area
where
huge
and
ancient
vehicles
lay
covered
with
the
slow
dust
of
centuries
and
the
vehicles
were
beginning
to
move
hauling
machines
were
loading
themselves
with
what
tropile
judged
were
quickly
synthesized
explosives
almost
forgotten
wheeled
vehicles
were
creeping
mindlessly
out
of
nearly
abandoned
storage
sections
and
lumbering
painfully
along
the
tunnels
of
the
planet
coming
toward
us
tropile
diagnosed
dispassionately
alla
narova
queried
they
mean
to
fight
of
course
you
see
if
you
can
penetrate
the
circuit
that
controls
them
i
already
he
was
flashing
away
i
get
to
the
boys
through
joey
it
was
queer
looking
through
the
eyes
of
the
alien
they
called
joey
colors
were
all
wrong
perspective
was
flat
but
he
could
see
though
cloudily
he
saw
haendl
joyously
fitting
a
bayonet
bayonet
to
a
rifle
he
saw
citizen
germyn
naked
but
puffing
valiantly
along
in
the
rear
tropile
said
through
the
strange
vocal
cords
that
belonged
to
the
alien
you
have
to
hurry
strange
to
speak
in
words
again
the
pyramids
are
heading
toward
the
chambers
where
the
components
are
kept
i
think
they
mean
to
kill
us
he
flashed
away
located
the
area
flashed
back
you
have
to
go
without
me
i
mean
without
the
only
way
i
see
to
get
there
is
through
a
narrow
little
ventilation
tunnel
i
guess
ventilation
is
what
it
was
for
quickly
but
against
the
familiar
race
of
thought
it
seemed
agonizingly
slow
he
laid
out
the
route
for
them
and
left
it
was
up
to
them
watching
from
a
dozen
viewpoints
at
once
he
saw
the
slow
creep
of
the
pyramids
machines
and
the
slower
intersecting
march
of
his
little
army
he
studied
the
alternate
cross
routes
and
contrived
to
block
some
of
them
by
interfering
with
the
of
the
emergency
doors
and
portals
but
there
were
some
circuits
he
could
not
control
the
pyramids
had
withdrawn
whole
sections
of
their
net
and
areas
of
the
planet
were
now
hidden
from
him
entirely
sections
of
the
vast
complex
were
no
longer
subject
to
his
interference
or
control
it
would
be
tropile
thought
dispassionately
a
rather
close
thing
the
chances
were
perhaps
six
out
of
ten
that
his
hastily
assembled
task
force
would
be
able
to
intercept
the
convoy
of
automatic
machines
before
it
could
reach
the
racks
of
nutrient
tanks
and
if
they
were
not
in
time
tropile
almost
laughed
out
loud
if
that
had
been
possible
why
then
his
body
would
be
destroyed
how
trivial
a
thing
to
worry
about
he
began
to
forget
he
owned
a
body
surely
it
was
someone
else
bone
and
tissue
that
lay
floating
in
the
snowflake
he
knew
that
this
was
not
so
he
knew
that
if
his
body
were
killed
he
would
die
and
yet
there
was
no
sense
of
fear
no
personal
involvement
it
was
an
interesting
problem
in
scheduling
and
nothing
more
would
the
human
fighters
get
there
in
time
perhaps
the
automatic
machines
had
senses
for
as
the
first
of
the
humans
burst
into
the
tunnel
they
were
using
a
few
hundred
yards
ahead
of
the
lead
the
machines
shuddered
to
a
stop
pause
for
a
second
then
laboriously
they
began
to
back
toward
the
nearest
of
the
side
passages
that
tropile
had
been
unable
to
block
he
scanned
it
hurriedly
good
good
the
circuits
surrounding
the
passage
proper
were
out
of
his
reach
but
it
led
to
another
passage
an
abandoned
pipeline
of
sorts
it
seemed
to
be
and
he
could
reach
patiently
how
slowly
the
machines
crept
along
he
waited
until
one
of
the
pyramids
machines
bearing
explosives
passed
through
an
enormous
valve
in
the
line
and
then
the
valve
was
thrown
the
explosion
triggered
every
vehicle
in
the
line
the
damage
was
complete
scratch
one
threat
from
the
pyramids
and
almost
at
once
there
was
another
urgent
call
from
alia
narova
tropile
quickly
the
pyramids
were
the
mightiest
race
of
warriors
the
universe
had
ever
known
they
were
invulnerable
and
unconquerable
except
from
within
like
alexander
the
great
they
had
met
every
enemy
and
whipped
them
all
and
like
dying
alexander
they
writhed
and
raged
against
the
tiny
unseen
bacillus
within
themselves
blindly
almost
suicidally
the
pyramids
returned
to
their
ancient
principle
of
the
geography
of
the
binary
planet
was
like
a
hive
of
bees
nearly
featureless
on
the
surface
but
internally
a
congeries
of
tunnels
chambers
warrens
rooms
tubes
and
amphitheaters
machinery
and
metal
components
were
everywhere
thick
under
the
planet
crust
the
more
delicate
and
more
useful
components
of
flesh
and
blood
were
to
a
degree
concentrated
in
a
few
areas
and
one
of
those
areas
had
disappeared
tropile
battering
futilely
with
his
mind
at
the
periphery
of
the
vanished
area
cried
sharply
to
alla
narova
and
the
others
it
looks
as
though
they
broken
a
piece
right
out
of
the
planet
everything
stops
here
there
a
physical
gap
which
i
ca
cross
hurry
one
of
you
what
was
this
section
for
propulsion
i
see
tropile
hesitated
confused
for
the
first
time
since
his
awakening
wait
he
retreated
to
the
snowflake
and
communed
with
the
other
members
now
become
something
that
resembled
his
general
staff
he
told
them
most
of
them
already
knew
but
the
telling
took
so
little
time
that
it
was
simpler
to
go
through
it
from
beginning
to
end
the
pyramids
attempted
to
cut
the
out
of
circuit
some
seconds
or
days
ago
and
were
unsuccessful
we
awakened
additional
components
and
were
able
to
maintain
contact
with
it
they
have
now
apparently
cut
it
loose
from
the
planet
itself
i
do
not
think
it
is
far
but
there
is
a
physical
space
between
the
importance
of
the
is
this
it
controls
the
master
generators
of
electrostatic
force
which
are
used
both
to
move
this
planet
and
ours
and
to
perform
the
act
of
translation
if
the
pyramids
control
it
they
may
be
able
to
take
us
out
of
circuit
perhaps
back
to
earth
perhaps
throwing
us
into
space
where
we
will
die
the
question
for
decision
how
can
we
counteract
this
move
a
rush
of
voices
all
spoke
at
once
it
was
no
trick
for
tropile
and
the
others
to
sort
them
out
and
follow
the
arguments
of
each
but
it
can
not
be
reproduced
at
last
one
said
there
is
a
way
i
will
do
it
it
was
alla
narova
what
is
the
way
tropile
demanded
curiously
alarmed
i
shall
go
with
them
trace
the
areas
the
pyramids
are
attempting
to
isolate
place
my
entire
self
by
this
she
meant
her
concentration
her
psyche
that
part
of
all
of
them
which
flashed
along
the
neurone
guides
unhampered
by
flesh
or
distance
in
the
most
likely
point
they
will
next
cut
loose
and
then
i
shall
cause
the
propulsion
units
on
the
severed
sections
to
force
them
back
into
circuit
tropile
objected
but
you
do
know
what
will
happen
we
have
never
been
cut
off
from
our
physical
bodies
alla
narova
it
may
be
death
it
may
not
be
possible
at
all
you
do
know
alla
narova
thought
a
smile
and
a
farewell
she
said
no
i
do
not
and
then
tropile
she
had
gone
furiously
tropile
hurled
himself
after
her
but
she
was
quick
as
he
too
quick
to
catch
she
was
gone
foolishness
he
shouted
silently
how
could
she
do
an
insane
chancy
thing
like
this
and
yet
what
else
was
there
to
do
they
were
all
ignorant
babes
temporarily
successful
because
there
had
been
no
defense
against
them
for
who
expects
babes
to
rise
up
in
rebellion
they
did
for
all
they
could
guess
or
imagine
the
pyramids
had
an
effective
counter
for
any
move
they
might
make
temporary
success
meant
nothing
it
was
the
final
decision
that
counted
when
either
the
pyramids
were
vanquished
or
the
men
and
what
steps
were
needed
to
make
that
decision
favor
the
men
were
anyone
guess
alla
narova
was
as
good
as
his
tropile
could
only
watch
and
wait
through
a
great
many
viewpoints
and
observers
he
was
able
to
see
roughly
what
happened
there
was
a
section
of
the
planet
next
the
severed
chunk
where
the
mind
and
senses
of
alla
narova
lay
coiled
for
a
moment
and
were
gone
for
what
it
had
accomplished
her
purpose
succeeded
she
had
been
taken
she
was
out
of
circuit
the
overwhelming
consciousness
of
loss
that
flooded
through
glenn
tropile
was
something
outside
of
all
his
experience
next
to
him
in
the
snowflake
the
body
which
he
had
learned
to
think
of
as
the
body
of
alla
narova
twisted
sharply
as
though
waking
from
a
dream
and
lay
flaccid
floating
in
the
fluid
alla
narova
narova
there
was
no
answer
a
voice
came
piercingly
tropile
here
now
quickly
alla
narova
he
flashed
away
to
see
what
the
other
voice
had
found
great
mindless
boulders
were
chipping
away
from
the
crust
of
the
binary
planet
and
whirling
like
midges
in
the
void
around
it
what
is
it
cried
one
of
the
others
tropile
had
no
answer
it
was
the
pyramids
clearly
were
they
attempting
to
demolish
their
own
planet
were
they
digging
away
at
the
crust
to
uncover
the
of
awakened
components
beneath
the
air
cried
tropile
sharply
and
knew
it
was
true
what
the
pyramids
were
up
to
was
a
simple
delousing
operation
if
you
could
destroy
their
own
machinery
for
maintaining
air
and
pressure
and
temperature
they
would
destroy
all
living
things
within
including
haendl
and
citizen
germyn
and
thus
in
the
final
analysis
including
the
bodies
of
tropile
and
his
awakened
fellows
for
without
the
mobile
troops
to
defend
their
helpless
cocoons
against
the
machines
of
the
pyramids
the
limp
bodies
could
be
destroyed
as
easily
as
a
larva
under
a
farmer
heel
so
alla
narova
had
failed
alone
against
the
pyramids
she
had
been
unable
to
bring
the
recaptured
sections
back
into
the
circuit
that
tropile
components
now
dominated
it
was
the
end
of
hope
but
it
was
not
the
fear
of
defeat
and
damnation
for
the
earth
that
paralyzed
tropile
it
was
alla
narova
gone
from
him
forever
the
pyramids
were
too
strong
and
yet
he
thought
quickening
they
had
been
too
strong
before
and
still
a
weak
spot
had
been
found
think
he
ordered
himself
desperately
and
then
again
think
components
stirred
restlessly
around
him
questioning
think
he
cried
mightily
all
of
you
think
think
of
your
lives
and
hopes
think
hope
worry
dream
the
components
were
reaching
toward
him
now
wonderingly
he
commanded
them
violently
do
it
concentrate
wish
think
let
your
minds
run
free
and
think
of
earth
pleasant
grass
and
warm
sun
think
of
loving
and
sweat
and
heartbreak
think
of
death
and
birth
for
the
love
of
heaven
and
the
answer
was
not
in
sound
but
it
was
deafening
in
the
sections
alla
narova
soaring
mind
lay
trapped
it
had
not
been
enough
she
could
not
force
her
will
against
the
dull
inflexibility
of
the
pyramids
until
that
inflexible
will
began
to
waver
there
was
a
leakage
of
thought
it
maddened
and
baffled
the
pyramids
the
whole
neuronic
network
was
resounding
to
a
babble
of
thoughts
and
emotions
that
to
a
pyramid
were
utterly
demented
the
rousing
component
minds
throbbed
with
urge
and
emotion
that
were
new
to
pyramid
experience
what
could
a
pyramid
make
of
a
human
sex
drive
or
of
the
aliens
passionate
deification
of
the
egg
what
of
hunger
and
thirst
and
the
blazing
for
odds
and
advantage
that
streamed
out
of
such
as
tropile
they
wavered
unsure
their
reactions
were
slow
and
very
confused
for
alla
narova
succeeded
in
her
purpose
she
was
able
to
reach
out
across
the
space
and
barrier
to
tropile
and
the
was
back
in
circuit
the
section
that
controlled
the
master
generators
of
the
electronic
scythe
lay
under
his
hands
now
he
cried
and
all
of
the
components
reached
out
to
grasp
and
move
now
and
the
central
control
was
theirs
the
full
flood
of
power
from
the
generators
was
at
their
command
now
now
now
and
they
reached
out
with
a
fat
pencil
of
electrostatic
force
and
caught
the
sluggish
brooding
pyramid
on
mount
everest
it
had
squatted
there
without
motion
for
more
than
two
centuries
now
it
quivered
and
seemed
to
draw
back
but
the
probing
pencil
caught
it
and
whirled
it
and
hurled
it
up
and
out
of
earth
into
the
tiny
artificial
sun
it
struck
with
a
flare
of
light
one
gone
gloated
tropile
alla
narova
are
you
there
still
here
she
called
from
a
great
distance
again
again
they
reached
for
the
pyramids
and
found
them
wherever
they
were
some
lay
close
to
the
surface
of
the
binary
planet
and
some
were
hundreds
of
miles
within
and
a
few
more
desperate
than
the
others
or
merely
assigned
to
the
task
they
discovered
at
the
very
portal
of
the
single
spaceship
of
the
pyramids
but
wherever
they
were
and
whatever
they
chose
to
do
each
one
of
them
was
found
and
seized
they
came
wriggling
and
shaking
like
trout
on
an
angler
line
they
came
bursting
through
layer
on
layer
of
impenetrable
metal
that
nevertheless
they
penetrated
they
came
by
the
dozens
and
scores
and
at
last
by
the
thousands
but
they
came
there
were
more
and
more
flares
of
light
on
the
tiny
sun
so
many
that
tropile
found
himself
scouring
the
planet
in
a
desperate
search
for
one
surviving
pyramid
not
to
destroy
as
an
enemy
but
to
keep
for
a
specimen
but
he
searched
in
vain
the
pyramids
were
destroyed
gone
there
was
not
one
left
the
earth
lay
open
and
free
under
its
tiny
sun
for
the
first
time
in
centuries
it
had
been
a
strange
war
but
a
short
one
and
it
was
over
xiv
tropile
swam
up
out
of
hammering
blackness
into
daylight
and
pain
it
he
was
being
born
again
coming
back
to
life
and
it
had
all
the
agonies
of
parturition
except
that
they
were
visited
upon
the
creature
being
born
himself
there
were
crushing
blows
at
his
temples
that
pounded
and
pained
like
no
other
ache
he
had
ever
felt
he
moaned
raspingly
someone
moved
blurrily
over
his
shut
eyes
he
felt
something
sting
sharply
at
the
base
of
his
brain
then
it
tingled
warming
his
scalp
comforting
it
numbing
it
pain
went
slowly
away
he
opened
his
eyes
four
masked
torturers
were
leaning
over
him
he
stared
not
understanding
but
the
eyes
were
not
torturers
eyes
and
in
a
moment
the
masks
came
off
surgical
masks
and
the
faces
beneath
the
masks
were
human
faces
surgeons
and
nurses
he
blinked
at
them
and
said
groggily
where
am
we
and
then
he
remembered
he
was
back
on
earth
he
was
merely
human
again
someone
came
bustling
into
the
room
and
he
knew
without
looking
that
it
was
haendl
we
beat
them
tropile
haendl
cried
no
cancel
that
beat
them
we
destroyed
every
pyramid
there
was
and
a
nice
hot
fire
they
making
up
there
on
the
sun
eh
beautiful
work
tropile
beautiful
you
a
credit
to
the
name
of
wolf
the
surgeons
stirred
uneasily
but
apparently
tropile
thought
there
had
been
changes
for
they
did
no
more
than
that
tropile
touched
his
temples
fretfully
and
his
fingers
rested
on
gauze
bandages
it
was
true
he
was
out
of
circuit
the
long
reach
of
his
awareness
was
cut
short
at
his
skull
there
was
no
more
of
the
infinite
sweep
and
grasp
he
had
known
as
part
of
the
snowflake
in
the
nutrient
fluid
too
bad
he
whispered
hopelessly
what
haendl
frowned
the
nurse
next
to
him
whispered
something
and
he
nodded
oh
i
see
you
still
a
little
groggy
right
well
that
not
hard
to
understand
they
tell
me
it
was
a
tricky
job
of
surgery
separating
you
from
that
gunk
the
pyramids
had
wired
into
your
head
yes
said
tropile
and
closed
his
ears
though
haendl
went
on
talking
after
a
while
tropile
pushed
himself
up
and
swung
his
legs
over
the
side
of
the
operating
table
he
was
naked
once
that
would
have
bothered
him
enormously
but
now
it
did
seem
to
matter
find
me
some
clothes
will
you
he
asked
i
back
i
might
as
well
start
getting
used
to
it
glenn
tropile
found
that
he
was
a
returning
hero
attracting
a
curious
sort
of
wherever
he
went
it
was
not
he
thought
after
careful
analysis
what
he
might
have
expected
for
instance
a
man
who
went
out
and
killed
a
dragon
in
the
old
days
was
received
with
great
gratitude
and
rejoicing
and
if
there
was
a
daughter
around
he
married
her
fair
enough
after
all
and
tropile
had
slain
a
foe
more
potent
than
any
number
of
dragons
but
he
tested
the
attention
he
received
and
found
no
gratitude
in
it
it
was
odd
what
it
was
like
most
of
all
he
thought
was
the
sort
of
attention
a
reigning
baseball
champion
might
get
in
a
country
where
cricket
was
the
national
game
he
had
done
something
which
everybody
agreed
was
an
astonishing
feat
but
about
which
nobody
seemed
to
care
indeed
there
was
an
area
of
accusation
in
some
of
the
attention
he
got
item
nearly
ninety
thousand
erstwhile
components
had
now
been
brought
back
to
ambient
life
most
of
them
with
their
families
long
dead
all
of
them
a
certain
drain
on
the
limited
resources
of
the
planet
and
what
was
glenn
tropile
going
to
do
about
it
item
the
old
distinctions
between
citizen
and
wolf
no
longer
made
much
sense
now
that
so
many
componentized
citizens
had
fought
shoulder
to
shoulder
with
componentized
sons
of
the
wolf
but
did
glenn
tropile
think
he
had
gone
a
little
too
far
and
item
looking
pretty
far
ahead
of
course
but
still
well
just
what
glenn
tropile
going
to
do
about
providing
a
new
sun
for
earth
when
the
old
one
wore
out
and
there
would
be
no
pyramids
to
tend
the
fire
he
sought
refuge
with
someone
who
would
understand
him
that
he
was
pleased
to
realize
was
easy
he
had
come
to
know
several
persons
extremely
well
loneliness
the
tortured
loneliness
of
his
youth
was
permanently
behind
him
for
example
he
could
seek
out
haendl
who
would
understand
everything
very
well
haendl
said
it
is
a
bit
of
a
letdown
i
suppose
well
hell
with
it
that
life
he
laughed
grimly
now
that
we
got
rid
of
the
pyramids
there
plenty
of
other
work
to
be
done
man
we
can
breathe
now
we
can
plan
ahead
this
planet
has
maundered
along
in
its
stupid
rutted
course
too
many
years
already
eh
it
time
we
took
over
and
we
be
doing
it
i
promise
you
you
know
tropile
he
sniggered
i
only
regret
one
thing
what
that
tropile
asked
cautiously
all
those
weapons
out
of
reach
oh
i
not
you
but
you
can
see
what
a
lot
of
trouble
it
going
to
be
now
stocking
up
all
over
again
and
there
is
much
we
can
do
about
bringing
order
to
this
tired
old
world
is
there
until
we
got
the
guns
to
do
it
with
again
tropile
left
him
much
sooner
than
he
had
planned
citizen
germyn
then
the
man
had
fought
well
if
nothing
else
tropile
went
to
find
him
and
for
a
moment
at
least
it
was
very
good
germyn
said
i
been
doing
a
lot
of
thinking
tropile
i
glad
here
he
sent
his
wife
for
refreshments
and
decorously
she
brought
them
in
waited
for
exactly
one
minute
and
then
absented
herself
tropile
burst
into
speech
as
soon
as
she
left
i
beginning
to
realize
what
has
happened
to
the
human
race
germyn
i
do
mean
just
now
when
we
licked
the
pyramids
and
so
on
no
i
mean
hundreds
of
years
ago
what
happened
when
the
pyramids
arrived
and
what
has
been
happening
since
did
you
ever
hear
of
indians
germyn
germyn
frowned
minutely
and
shrugged
they
were
oh
hundreds
hundreds
of
years
ago
they
were
a
different
color
and
not
very
civilized
of
course
nobody
was
then
but
the
indians
were
nomads
herdsmen
hunters
like
that
and
the
white
people
came
from
europe
and
wanted
this
country
for
themselves
so
they
took
it
and
do
you
know
something
i
do
think
the
indians
ever
knew
what
hit
them
did
know
about
land
grants
and
claiming
territory
for
the
crown
and
church
missions
and
expanding
populations
they
did
have
those
things
it
true
that
they
learned
pretty
well
by
and
by
at
least
they
learned
things
like
guns
and
horses
and
firewater
they
did
have
those
things
either
but
they
could
see
some
sense
to
them
you
know
but
i
really
do
think
the
indians
ever
knew
exactly
what
the
europeans
were
up
to
until
it
was
too
late
to
matter
and
it
was
the
same
with
us
and
the
pyramids
only
more
so
what
the
devil
they
want
i
mean
yes
we
found
out
what
they
did
with
the
translated
people
but
what
were
they
to
what
did
they
they
think
you
know
i
got
a
kind
of
a
crazy
idea
maybe
it
not
crazy
maybe
it
the
truth
anyway
i
been
thinking
suppose
even
the
were
the
pyramids
we
never
talked
to
one
of
them
we
never
gave
it
a
rorschach
or
tested
its
knee
jerks
we
licked
them
but
we
do
know
anything
about
them
we
even
know
if
they
were
the
guys
that
started
the
whole
bloody
thing
or
if
they
were
just
sort
of
components
themselves
do
we
and
meanwhile
here
the
human
race
up
against
something
that
it
not
only
ca
understand
same
as
the
indians
could
the
whites
but
that
it
ca
begin
to
make
a
about
at
least
the
indians
had
a
clue
now
and
then
you
know
i
mean
they
see
the
sailors
off
the
great
white
devil
ship
making
a
beeline
for
the
indian
women
and
so
on
and
they
begin
to
understand
there
was
in
common
but
we
did
have
that
much
so
what
did
we
do
why
we
did
like
the
reservation
indians
we
turned
inward
we
got
loaded
on
firewater
meditation
and
we
closed
our
minds
to
the
possibility
of
ever
expanding
again
and
there
we
were
all
tied
up
in
our
own
knots
most
of
the
race
rebelled
against
action
because
it
had
proven
useless
citizens
a
few
of
the
race
rebelled
against
because
it
was
not
only
useless
but
useless
wolves
but
they
the
same
kind
of
people
you
seen
that
for
yourself
right
and
tropile
stopped
suddenly
aware
that
citizen
germyn
was
looking
tepidly
pained
what
the
matter
tropile
demanded
harshly
citizen
germyn
gave
him
the
faint
deprecatory
quirked
smile
i
know
you
thought
you
were
a
wolf
but
i
told
you
i
been
thinking
a
lot
and
that
what
i
was
thinking
about
citizen
you
do
yourself
no
good
by
pretending
that
you
really
thought
you
were
wolf
clearly
you
were
not
the
rest
of
us
might
have
been
fooled
but
certainly
you
could
fool
yourself
now
here
what
i
think
you
ought
to
do
when
i
found
you
were
coming
i
asked
several
rather
citizens
to
come
here
later
this
evening
there
wo
be
any
embarrassment
i
only
want
you
to
talk
to
them
and
set
the
record
straight
so
that
this
terrible
blemish
will
no
longer
be
held
against
you
times
change
and
perhaps
a
certain
latitude
is
advisable
now
but
certainly
you
do
want
tropile
also
left
citizen
germyn
sooner
than
he
had
expected
to
there
remained
alla
narova
but
queerly
she
was
not
to
be
found
instantly
it
became
clear
to
tropile
that
it
was
she
above
all
whom
he
needed
to
talk
to
he
remembered
the
shared
beauty
of
their
plunging
drive
through
the
of
the
pyramids
the
linked
and
inextricable
flow
of
their
thoughts
and
of
their
most
hidden
feelings
she
could
not
be
very
far
he
thought
numbly
cursing
the
blindness
of
his
human
eyes
the
narrowness
of
his
human
senses
time
was
when
two
worlds
could
not
have
hidden
her
from
him
but
that
time
was
gone
he
walked
from
place
to
place
with
the
angry
resentful
tread
of
one
used
to
riding
no
to
flying
or
faster
than
flying
he
asked
after
her
he
searched
and
at
last
he
found
not
her
a
note
at
one
of
the
stations
where
the
components
were
funneled
back
into
human
affairs
there
was
a
letter
waiting
for
him
sure
you
will
look
for
me
please
do
you
thought
that
there
were
no
secrets
between
us
but
there
was
i
was
translated
i
was
years
old
two
years
before
that
i
was
caught
in
a
collapsing
building
my
legs
are
useless
and
i
had
grown
quite
fat
i
do
not
want
you
to
see
me
fat
and
and
that
was
that
and
at
last
glenn
tropile
turned
to
the
last
person
of
all
those
on
his
list
who
had
known
him
well
her
name
was
gala
tropile
she
had
got
thinner
he
observed
they
sat
together
quietly
and
there
was
considerable
awkwardness
but
then
he
noticed
that
she
was
weeping
comforting
her
ended
the
awkwardness
and
he
found
that
he
was
talking
it
was
like
being
a
god
gala
i
swear
there
no
feeling
like
it
i
mean
it
like
well
maybe
if
you
just
had
a
baby
and
invented
fire
and
moved
a
mountain
and
transmuted
lead
into
gold
maybe
if
you
done
all
of
those
things
then
you
might
have
some
idea
but
i
was
everywhere
at
once
gala
and
i
could
do
anything
i
fought
a
whole
world
of
pyramids
do
you
realize
that
me
and
now
i
come
back
to
he
stopped
her
in
time
it
seemed
she
was
about
to
weep
again
he
went
on
no
gala
do
misunderstand
i
do
hold
anything
against
you
you
were
right
to
leave
me
in
the
field
what
did
i
have
to
offer
you
or
myself
for
that
matter
and
i
do
know
that
i
have
anything
now
but
he
slammed
his
fist
against
the
table
they
talk
about
putting
the
earth
back
in
its
orbit
why
and
how
my
god
gala
we
do
know
we
are
maybe
we
could
tinker
up
the
gadgets
the
pyramids
used
and
turn
our
course
backward
but
do
you
know
what
old
sol
looks
like
i
do
i
never
saw
it
and
neither
did
you
or
anyone
else
alive
it
was
like
being
a
god
and
they
talk
about
going
back
to
things
as
they
were
i
sick
of
that
kind
of
thinking
wolves
or
citizens
they
dead
on
their
feet
and
do
know
it
i
suppose
they
snap
out
of
it
in
time
but
i
ca
wait
i
wo
live
that
long
unless
he
paused
and
looked
at
her
confused
gala
tropile
met
her
husband
eyes
unless
what
glenn
he
shrugged
and
turned
away
unless
you
go
back
you
mean
he
stared
at
her
she
nodded
you
want
to
go
back
she
said
without
stress
you
do
want
to
stay
here
with
me
do
you
you
want
to
go
back
into
that
tub
of
soup
again
and
float
like
a
baby
you
do
want
to
babies
you
want
to
one
gala
you
do
understand
we
can
own
the
universe
i
mean
mankind
can
and
i
can
do
it
why
not
there
nothing
for
me
that
right
glenn
there
nothing
for
you
here
not
any
more
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
looked
at
her
spread
his
hands
helplessly
he
did
look
back
as
he
walked
out
the
door
but
he
knew
that
his
back
was
turned
not
only
on
the
woman
who
happened
to
be
his
wife
but
on
mankind
and
all
of
the
flesh
it
was
night
outside
and
warm
tropile
stood
in
the
old
street
surrounded
by
the
low
battered
houses
and
he
could
make
them
new
and
grand
he
looked
up
at
the
stars
that
swung
in
constellations
too
new
and
changeable
to
have
names
was
the
universe
words
were
no
good
there
was
no
explaining
things
in
words
naturally
he
could
make
gala
or
anyone
else
understand
for
flesh
grasp
the
realities
of
mind
and
spirit
that
were
liberated
from
flesh
babies
a
home
and
the
whole
grubby
animal
business
of
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
how
could
anyone
ask
to
stay
in
the
mire
when
the
stars
challenged
overhead
he
walked
slowly
down
the
street
alone
in
the
night
an
apprentice
godling
renouncing
mortality
there
was
nothing
here
for
him
so
why
this
sense
of
loss
duty
said
or
was
it
pride
someone
must
give
up
the
flesh
to
control
earth
orbit
and
weather
why
not
you
flesh
said
or
was
it
his
soul
whatever
that
was
but
you
will
be
he
stopped
and
for
a
moment
he
was
poised
between
destiny
and
the
dust
until
he
became
aware
of
footsteps
behind
him
running
and
voice
wait
wait
glenn
i
want
to
go
with
you
and
he
turned
and
waited
but
only
until
she
caught
up
and
then
he
went
on
but
not
forever
and
always
again
not
alone
