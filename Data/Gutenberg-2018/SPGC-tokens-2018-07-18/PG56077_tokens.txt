a
sporting
proposition
outside
a
door
on
the
seventeenth
floor
of
a
new
york
office
building
a
tall
young
man
in
a
coat
stood
shivering
why
did
he
shiver
in
that
coat
he
shivered
because
he
was
fussed
poor
chap
because
he
was
rattled
from
the
soles
of
his
boots
to
the
apex
of
his
piccadilly
hat
a
painful
palpitating
spectacle
he
stood
meanwhile
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
the
business
of
the
american
branch
of
that
famous
marine
insurance
firm
lloyds
of
london
usually
termed
in
magazine
articles
the
greatest
gambling
institution
in
the
world
went
on
oblivious
to
the
shiverer
who
approached
the
shiverer
with
a
nervous
movement
shifted
his
to
his
left
hand
and
laid
his
right
on
the
though
he
is
not
at
his
best
let
us
take
a
look
at
him
tall
as
has
been
noted
perfectly
garbed
after
london
taste
mild
and
blue
as
to
eye
blond
as
to
hair
a
handsome
if
somewhat
weak
face
very
distinguished
even
aristocratic
in
appearance
perhaps
the
thrill
for
us
democrats
here
of
the
nobility
and
at
this
moment
sadly
in
need
of
a
generous
dose
of
that
courage
that
abounds
see
any
book
of
familiar
quotations
on
the
playing
fields
of
eton
utterly
destitute
of
the
eton
or
any
other
brand
he
pushed
open
the
door
the
click
of
two
dozen
american
typewriters
smote
upon
his
hearing
an
office
boy
of
the
dominant
new
york
race
demanded
in
loud
indiscreet
tones
his
business
there
my
business
said
the
tall
young
man
weakly
is
with
lloyds
of
london
the
boy
wandered
off
down
that
lane
in
a
moment
he
was
back
thacker
see
you
he
announced
he
followed
the
boy
did
the
tall
young
man
his
courage
began
to
return
why
not
one
of
his
ancestors
graduate
of
those
playing
fields
had
fought
at
waterloo
thacker
sat
in
plump
and
genial
prosperity
before
a
polished
desk
opposite
him
at
a
desk
equally
polished
sat
an
even
more
polished
young
american
of
capable
bearing
for
an
embarrassed
moment
the
tall
youth
in
fur
stood
looking
from
one
to
the
other
then
thacker
spoke
you
have
business
with
lloyds
the
tall
young
man
blushed
i
i
hope
to
have
yes
there
was
in
his
speech
that
faint
suggestion
of
a
lisp
that
marks
many
of
the
of
his
race
perhaps
it
is
the
golden
spoon
in
their
mouths
interfering
a
bit
with
their
diction
what
can
we
do
for
you
thacker
was
cold
and
like
a
card
index
steadily
through
each
week
he
grew
more
businesslike
and
this
was
saturday
morning
the
visitor
performed
a
shaky
but
remarkable
juggling
feat
with
his
i
well
i
he
stammered
oh
come
come
thought
thacker
impatiently
well
said
the
tall
young
man
desperately
perhaps
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
make
myself
known
at
once
i
am
allan
lord
harrowby
son
and
heir
of
james
nelson
harrowby
earl
of
raybrook
and
i
i
have
come
here
the
younger
of
the
americans
spoke
in
more
kindly
fashion
you
have
a
proposition
to
make
to
lloyds
exactly
said
lord
harrowby
and
sank
with
a
sigh
of
relief
into
a
chair
as
though
that
concluded
his
portion
of
the
entertainment
let
hear
it
boomed
the
relentless
thacker
lord
harrowby
writhed
in
his
chair
i
am
sure
you
will
pardon
me
he
said
if
i
preface
my
er
proposition
with
the
statement
that
it
is
utterly
fantastic
and
if
i
add
also
that
it
should
be
known
to
the
fewest
possible
number
thacker
waved
his
hand
across
the
gleaming
surfaces
of
two
desks
this
is
my
assistant
manager
richard
minot
he
announced
minot
you
must
know
is
in
on
all
the
secrets
of
the
firm
now
have
it
i
am
right
am
i
not
his
lordship
continued
in
the
assumption
that
lloyds
frequently
takes
rather
unusual
risks
lloyds
answered
thacker
is
chiefly
concerned
with
the
fortunes
of
those
who
go
down
to
and
sometimes
down
into
the
sea
in
ships
however
there
are
a
number
of
underwriters
connected
with
lloyds
and
these
men
have
been
known
to
risk
their
money
on
pretty
giddy
chances
it
all
done
in
the
name
of
lloyds
though
the
firm
is
not
financially
responsible
lord
harrowby
got
quickly
to
his
feet
then
it
would
be
better
he
said
relieved
for
me
to
take
my
proposition
to
one
of
these
underwriters
thacker
frowned
curiosity
agitated
his
bosom
you
have
to
go
to
london
to
do
that
he
remarked
better
give
us
an
inkling
of
what
on
your
mind
his
lordship
tapped
uneasily
at
the
base
of
thacker
desk
with
his
stick
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
rather
not
he
said
oh
very
well
sighed
thacker
how
about
owen
jephson
asked
minot
suddenly
overjoyed
thacker
started
up
by
gad
i
forgot
about
jephson
sails
at
one
does
he
he
turned
to
lord
harrowby
the
very
man
and
in
new
york
too
jephson
would
insure
roosevelt
against
another
cup
of
coffee
am
i
to
understand
asked
harrowby
that
jephson
is
the
man
for
me
to
see
exactly
beamed
thacker
i
have
him
here
in
fifteen
minutes
richard
will
you
please
call
up
his
hotel
and
as
minot
reached
for
the
telephone
thacker
added
pleadingly
of
course
i
know
the
nature
of
your
proposition
no
agreed
lord
harrowby
politely
discouraged
thacker
gave
up
however
jephson
seems
to
have
a
gambling
streak
in
him
that
odd
risks
appeal
to
he
went
on
of
course
he
scientific
all
risks
are
scientifically
investigated
but
occasionally
well
jephson
insured
sir
christopher
conway
against
the
arrival
of
twins
in
his
family
perhaps
you
recall
the
litigation
that
resulted
when
triplets
put
in
their
appearance
i
sorry
to
say
i
do
not
said
lord
harrowby
minot
set
down
the
telephone
owen
jephson
is
on
his
way
here
in
a
taxi
he
announced
good
old
jephson
mused
thacker
reminiscent
why
some
of
the
man
risks
are
famous
take
that
shopkeeper
in
the
strand
every
day
at
noon
the
shadow
of
nelson
monument
in
trafalgar
square
falls
across
his
door
twenty
years
ago
he
got
to
worrying
for
fear
the
statue
would
fall
some
day
and
smash
his
shop
and
every
year
since
he
has
taken
out
a
policy
with
jephson
insuring
him
against
that
dreadful
contingency
i
seem
to
have
heard
of
that
admitted
harrowby
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
you
must
have
only
recently
jephson
wrote
a
policy
for
the
dowager
duchess
of
tremayne
insuring
her
against
the
unhappy
event
of
a
rainstorm
spoiling
the
garden
party
she
is
shortly
to
give
at
her
italian
villa
i
understand
a
small
fortune
is
involved
then
there
is
courtney
giles
leading
man
at
the
west
end
road
theater
he
fears
obesity
jephson
has
insured
him
should
he
become
too
plump
for
romeo
roles
lloyds
or
rather
jephson
will
owe
him
a
large
sum
of
money
i
am
encouraged
to
hope
remarked
lord
harrowby
that
jephson
will
listen
to
my
proposition
no
doubt
he
will
replied
thacker
i
ca
say
definitely
now
if
i
knew
the
nature
but
when
jephson
walked
into
the
office
fifteen
minutes
later
thacker
was
still
lamentably
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
his
titled
visitor
business
jephson
was
a
small
wiry
man
crowned
by
a
vast
acreage
of
bald
head
and
with
the
immobile
countenance
sometimes
lovingly
known
as
a
poker
face
one
felt
he
could
watch
the
rain
pour
in
torrents
on
the
dowager
duchess
courtney
giles
waist
expand
visibly
before
his
eyes
the
statue
of
nelson
totter
and
fall
on
his
shopkeeper
and
never
move
a
muscle
of
that
face
i
am
delighted
to
meet
your
lordship
said
he
to
harrowby
knew
your
father
the
earl
very
well
at
one
time
had
business
dealings
with
him
often
a
man
after
my
own
heart
always
ready
to
take
a
risk
i
trust
you
left
him
well
quite
thank
you
lord
harrowby
answered
although
he
will
insist
on
playing
polo
at
his
age
it
is
a
dangerous
sport
jephson
smiled
still
taking
chances
he
said
a
splendid
old
gentleman
i
understand
that
you
lord
harrowby
have
a
proposition
to
make
to
me
as
an
underwriter
in
lloyds
they
sat
down
alas
if
burke
who
compiled
the
could
have
seen
lord
harrowby
then
what
distress
would
have
been
his
for
a
most
unlordly
flush
again
mantled
that
british
cheek
a
nobleman
was
supremely
rattled
i
will
try
and
explain
said
his
lordship
gulping
a
plebeian
gulp
my
affairs
have
been
for
some
time
in
rather
a
chaotic
state
idleness
the
life
of
the
town
you
gentlemen
will
understand
naturally
it
has
been
suggested
to
me
that
i
exchange
my
name
and
title
for
the
millions
of
some
american
heiress
i
have
always
violently
objected
to
any
such
plan
i
i
could
quite
bring
myself
to
do
any
such
low
trick
as
that
and
then
a
few
months
ago
on
the
continent
i
met
a
girl
he
paused
i
not
a
clever
chap
really
he
went
on
i
afraid
i
can
not
describe
her
to
you
spirited
charming
he
looked
toward
the
youngest
of
the
trio
you
at
least
understand
he
finished
minot
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
smiled
a
most
engaging
smile
perfectly
he
said
thank
you
went
on
lord
harrowby
in
all
seriousness
it
was
only
incidental
quite
irrelevant
that
this
young
woman
happened
to
be
very
wealthy
i
fell
desperately
in
love
i
am
still
in
that
er
pleasing
state
the
young
lady
name
gentlemen
is
cynthia
meyrick
she
is
the
daughter
of
spencer
meyrick
whose
fortune
has
i
believe
been
accumulated
in
oil
thacker
eyebrows
rose
respectfully
a
week
from
next
tuesday
said
lord
harrowby
solemnly
at
san
marco
on
the
east
coast
of
florida
this
young
woman
and
i
are
to
be
married
and
what
asked
owen
jephson
is
your
proposition
lord
harrowby
shifted
nervously
in
his
chair
i
say
we
are
to
be
married
he
continued
but
are
we
that
is
the
nightmare
that
haunts
me
a
slip
my
er
creditors
coming
down
on
me
and
far
more
important
the
dreadful
agony
of
losing
the
dearest
woman
in
the
world
what
could
happen
jephson
wanted
to
know
did
i
say
the
young
woman
was
vivacious
inquired
lord
harrowby
she
is
a
thousand
girls
in
one
some
untoward
happening
and
she
might
change
her
mind
in
a
flash
silence
within
the
room
outside
the
roar
of
new
york
and
the
clatter
of
the
inevitable
riveting
machine
making
its
points
relentlessly
that
said
lord
harrowby
slowly
is
what
i
wish
you
to
insure
me
against
mr
jephson
you
mean
i
mean
the
awful
possibility
of
miss
cynthia
meyrick
changing
her
mind
again
silence
save
for
the
riveting
machine
outside
and
three
men
looking
unbelievingly
at
one
another
of
course
his
lordship
went
on
hastily
it
is
understood
that
i
personally
am
very
eager
for
this
wedding
to
take
place
it
is
understood
that
in
the
interval
before
the
ceremony
i
shall
do
all
in
my
power
to
keep
miss
meyrick
to
her
present
intention
should
the
marriage
be
abandoned
because
of
any
act
of
mine
i
would
be
ready
to
forfeit
all
claims
on
lloyds
thacker
recovered
his
breath
and
his
voice
at
one
and
the
same
time
preposterous
he
snorted
begging
your
lordship
pardon
you
can
not
expect
business
men
to
listen
seriously
to
any
such
proposition
as
that
tushery
sir
tushery
speaking
as
the
american
representative
of
lloyds
one
moment
interrupted
jephson
in
his
eyes
shone
a
queer
light
a
light
such
as
one
might
expect
to
find
in
the
eyes
of
peter
pan
the
boy
who
never
grew
up
one
moment
please
what
sum
had
you
in
mind
lord
harrowby
well
say
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
suggested
his
lordship
i
realize
that
my
proposition
is
fantastic
i
really
admitted
as
much
but
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
jephson
repeated
it
thoughtfully
i
should
have
to
charge
your
lordship
a
rather
high
rate
as
high
as
ten
per
cent
lord
harrowby
seemed
to
be
in
the
throes
of
mental
arithmetic
i
am
afraid
he
said
finally
i
could
not
afford
one
hundred
thousand
at
that
rate
but
i
could
afford
thousand
would
that
be
satisfactory
mr
jephson
jephson
cried
thacker
wildly
are
you
mad
do
you
realize
i
realize
everything
thacker
said
jephson
calmly
i
have
your
lordship
word
that
the
young
lady
is
at
present
determined
on
this
alliance
and
that
you
will
do
all
in
your
power
to
keep
her
to
her
intention
you
have
my
word
said
lord
harrowby
if
you
should
care
to
telegraph
your
word
is
sufficient
said
jephson
minot
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
bring
me
a
policy
blank
see
here
jephson
foamed
thacker
what
if
this
thing
should
get
into
the
newspapers
we
be
the
of
the
business
world
it
must
said
jephson
coolly
it
might
roared
thacker
minot
arrived
with
a
blank
policy
and
jephson
sat
down
at
the
young
man
desk
one
minute
said
thacker
the
faith
of
you
two
gentlemen
in
each
other
is
touching
but
i
take
it
the
millennium
is
still
a
few
years
off
he
drew
toward
him
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
i
want
this
thing
done
in
a
businesslike
way
if
it
to
be
done
in
my
office
he
handed
the
sheet
of
paper
to
lord
harrowby
will
you
read
that
please
he
said
certainly
his
lordship
read
i
hereby
agree
that
in
the
interval
until
my
wedding
with
miss
cynthia
meyrick
next
tuesday
week
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
to
put
through
the
match
and
that
should
the
wedding
be
called
off
through
any
subsequent
direct
act
of
mine
i
will
forfeit
all
claims
on
lloyds
will
you
sign
that
please
requested
thacker
with
pleasure
his
lordship
reached
for
a
pen
you
and
i
richard
said
thacker
will
sign
as
witnesses
now
jephson
go
ahead
with
your
fool
policy
jephson
looked
up
thoughtfully
shall
i
say
your
lordship
he
asked
that
if
two
weeks
from
the
wedding
has
not
taken
place
and
has
absolutely
no
prospect
of
taking
place
i
owe
you
thousand
pounds
yes
his
lordship
nodded
provided
of
course
i
have
not
forfeited
by
reason
of
this
agreement
i
shall
write
you
a
check
mr
jephson
for
a
time
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room
save
the
scratching
of
two
pens
while
thacker
gazed
at
minot
and
minot
smiled
back
then
jephson
reached
for
a
blotter
i
shall
attend
to
the
london
end
of
this
when
i
reach
there
five
days
hence
he
said
perhaps
i
can
find
another
underwriter
to
share
the
risk
with
me
the
transaction
was
completed
and
his
lordship
rose
to
go
i
am
at
the
plaza
he
said
if
any
difficulty
should
arise
but
i
sail
for
san
marco
on
the
yacht
of
a
friend
he
crossed
over
and
took
jephson
hand
i
can
only
hope
with
all
my
heart
he
finished
feelingly
that
you
never
have
to
pay
this
policy
we
with
your
lordship
there
said
thacker
sharply
ah
you
have
been
very
kind
replied
lord
harrowby
i
wish
you
all
good
day
and
shivering
no
longer
he
went
away
in
his
fine
fur
coat
as
the
door
closed
upon
the
nobleman
thacker
turned
explosively
on
his
friend
from
oversea
jephson
he
thundered
you
an
idiot
a
rank
unmitigated
idiot
the
peter
pan
light
was
bright
in
jephson
eyes
so
new
he
so
original
bless
the
boy
heart
i
been
waiting
forty
years
for
a
proposition
like
that
do
you
realize
thacker
cried
that
thousand
pounds
of
your
good
money
depends
on
the
honor
of
lord
harrowby
i
do
returned
jephson
and
i
would
not
be
concerned
if
it
were
ten
times
that
sum
i
know
the
breed
why
once
and
you
thacker
would
have
called
me
an
idiot
on
that
occasion
too
i
insured
his
father
against
the
loss
of
a
polo
game
by
a
team
on
which
the
earl
was
playing
and
he
played
like
the
devil
the
earl
did
won
the
game
himself
ah
i
know
the
breed
oh
well
sighed
thacker
i
wo
argue
but
one
thing
is
certain
jephson
you
ca
go
back
to
england
now
your
place
is
in
san
marco
with
one
hand
on
the
rope
that
rings
the
wedding
bells
jephson
shook
his
great
bald
head
no
he
said
i
must
return
it
is
absolutely
necessary
my
interests
in
san
marco
are
in
the
hands
of
providence
thacker
walked
the
floor
wildly
providence
needs
help
in
handling
a
woman
he
protested
miss
meyrick
must
not
change
her
mind
some
one
must
see
that
she
does
if
you
ca
go
yourself
he
paused
reflecting
some
young
man
active
capable
richard
minot
had
risen
from
his
chair
and
was
moving
softly
toward
his
overcoat
looking
over
his
shoulder
he
beheld
thacker
keen
eyes
upon
him
just
going
out
to
lunch
he
said
guiltily
sit
down
richard
remarked
thacker
with
decision
minot
sat
the
dread
of
something
impending
in
his
heart
jephson
said
thacker
this
boy
here
is
the
son
of
a
man
of
whom
i
was
very
fond
his
father
left
him
the
means
to
squander
his
life
on
clubs
and
cocktails
if
he
had
chosen
but
he
picked
out
a
business
career
instead
five
years
ago
i
took
him
into
this
office
and
he
has
repaid
me
by
faithful
even
brilliant
service
i
would
trust
him
with
well
i
trust
him
as
far
as
you
trust
a
member
of
your
own
peerage
yes
said
jephson
thacker
wheeled
dramatically
and
faced
his
young
assistant
richard
he
ordered
go
to
san
marco
go
to
san
marco
and
see
to
it
that
miss
cynthia
meyrick
does
not
change
her
mind
a
gone
feeling
shot
through
minot
in
the
vicinity
of
his
stomach
it
was
possible
that
he
really
needed
that
lunch
yes
sir
he
said
faintly
of
course
it
up
to
me
to
do
anything
you
say
if
you
insist
i
go
but
but
what
richard
is
it
a
rather
big
order
women
are
they
like
an
er
april
afternoon
or
something
of
that
sort
it
seems
to
me
i
read
they
were
in
books
humph
snorted
thacker
is
your
knowledge
of
the
ways
of
women
confined
to
books
a
close
observer
might
have
noted
the
ghost
of
a
smile
in
clear
blue
eyes
in
part
it
is
he
admitted
and
then
again
in
part
it
is
well
put
away
your
books
my
boy
said
thacker
a
nice
instructive
little
vacation
has
fallen
on
you
from
heaven
mad
old
jephson
here
must
be
saved
from
himself
that
wedding
must
take
place
positively
rain
or
shine
i
trust
you
to
see
that
it
does
richard
minot
rose
and
stepped
over
to
his
hat
and
coat
i
off
for
san
marco
he
announced
blithely
his
lips
were
firm
but
smiling
the
land
of
sunshine
and
flowers
and
orange
blossoms
or
i
know
the
reason
why
jephson
trusts
harrowby
said
thacker
all
very
well
but
just
the
same
if
i
were
you
i
be
aboard
that
yacht
when
it
leaves
new
york
harbor
invited
or
uninvited
i
must
ask
put
in
jephson
hurriedly
that
you
do
nothing
to
embarrass
lord
harrowby
in
any
way
no
said
thacker
but
keep
an
eye
on
him
my
boy
a
keen
and
busy
eye
i
will
agreed
minot
do
i
look
like
cupid
gentlemen
no
ah
it
the
overcoat
well
i
get
rid
of
that
in
florida
say
he
shook
hands
with
jephson
and
with
thacker
richard
said
the
latter
i
really
fond
of
old
jephson
here
he
been
my
friend
in
need
he
must
lose
i
trust
you
my
boy
i
wo
disappoint
you
dick
minot
promised
a
look
of
seriousness
flashed
across
his
face
miss
cynthia
meyrick
changes
her
mind
only
over
my
dead
body
he
paused
for
a
second
at
the
door
and
his
eyes
grew
suddenly
thoughtful
i
wonder
what
she
like
he
murmured
then
with
a
smile
toward
the
two
men
left
behind
he
went
out
and
down
that
land
to
san
marco
chapter
ii
an
evening
in
the
river
though
san
marco
is
a
particularly
gaudy
tassel
on
the
fringe
of
the
tourist
south
it
was
to
the
north
that
richard
minot
first
turned
one
hour
later
he
made
his
appearance
amid
the
gold
braid
and
dignity
of
the
plaza
lobby
the
young
man
behind
the
desk
an
exquisite
creature
done
in
charles
dana
gibson
best
manner
knew
when
to
be
affable
he
also
knew
when
not
to
be
affable
upon
minot
he
turned
the
cold
fishy
stare
he
kept
for
such
as
were
not
guests
under
his
charge
what
is
your
business
with
lord
harrowby
he
inquired
suspiciously
since
when
asked
minot
brightly
have
you
been
in
his
lordship
confidence
this
was
the
young
man
cue
to
wince
but
hotel
clerks
are
notoriously
poor
wincers
it
is
customary
he
began
with
perfect
poise
i
know
said
minot
but
then
i
a
sort
of
a
friend
of
his
lordship
a
sort
of
a
friend
how
well
he
lifted
his
eyebrows
something
like
that
i
believe
i
to
be
best
man
at
his
wedding
ah
yes
that
splendid
young
man
knew
when
to
be
affable
affability
swamped
him
now
boy
he
cried
take
this
gentleman
card
to
lord
harrowby
a
in
a
zenda
uniform
accepted
the
card
laid
it
upon
a
silver
tray
glued
it
down
with
a
large
new
york
thumb
and
strayed
off
down
gilded
corridors
shouting
lord
harrowby
whereat
all
the
pretty
little
debutantes
who
happened
to
be
decorating
the
scene
at
the
moment
felt
their
pampered
hearts
go
and
closing
their
eyes
saw
visions
and
dreamed
dreams
lord
harrowby
was
at
luncheon
and
sent
word
for
minot
to
join
him
entering
the
gay
minot
saw
at
the
far
end
the
blond
and
noble
head
he
sought
he
threaded
his
way
between
the
tables
although
he
was
an
unusually
attractive
young
man
he
had
never
experienced
anything
like
the
array
of
stares
turned
upon
him
ere
he
had
gone
ten
feet
what
the
devil
the
matter
he
asked
himself
i
seem
to
be
the
cynosure
of
neighboring
eyes
and
then
some
he
did
not
dream
that
it
was
because
he
was
passing
through
a
of
democrats
to
grasp
the
hand
of
a
lord
my
dear
fellow
i
delighted
i
assure
you
really
lord
harrowby
face
should
have
paid
closer
attention
to
his
words
just
now
it
failed
ignominiously
in
the
matter
of
backing
them
up
thank
you
minot
replied
your
lordship
is
no
doubt
surprised
at
seeing
me
so
soon
well
er
not
at
all
shall
i
order
luncheon
no
thanks
i
had
a
bite
on
the
way
up
and
minot
dropped
into
the
chair
which
an
eager
waiter
held
ready
lord
harrowby
i
trust
you
are
not
going
to
be
annoyed
by
what
i
have
to
tell
you
his
lordship
face
clouded
and
worry
entered
the
mild
blue
eyes
i
hope
there
nothing
wrong
about
the
policy
nothing
whatever
lord
harrowby
jephson
trusts
you
implicitly
so
i
perceived
this
morning
i
was
deeply
touched
it
was
er
touching
minot
smiled
a
bit
cynically
understanding
as
you
do
how
jephson
feels
toward
you
you
will
realize
that
it
is
in
no
sense
a
reflection
on
you
that
our
office
viewing
this
matter
in
a
purely
business
light
has
decided
that
some
one
must
go
to
san
marco
with
you
some
one
who
will
protect
jephson
interests
your
office
said
his
lordship
reflecting
you
mean
thacker
do
you
could
it
be
that
the
fellow
was
not
so
slow
as
he
seemed
thacker
is
the
head
of
our
office
smiled
minot
it
has
been
thought
best
that
some
one
go
with
you
lord
harrowby
some
one
who
will
work
night
and
day
to
see
to
it
that
miss
meyrick
does
not
change
her
mind
i
i
am
the
some
one
i
hope
you
are
not
annoyed
my
dear
chap
not
in
the
least
when
i
said
this
morning
that
i
was
quite
set
on
this
marriage
i
was
frightfully
sincere
and
now
his
lordship
face
frank
and
boyish
in
nowise
belied
his
words
i
shall
be
deeply
grateful
for
any
aid
lloyds
can
give
me
and
i
am
already
grateful
that
lloyds
has
selected
you
to
be
my
ally
really
very
decent
of
him
dick
minot
bowed
you
go
south
he
ventured
yes
on
the
yacht
belonging
to
my
friend
martin
wall
you
have
heard
of
him
no
i
ca
say
that
i
have
indeed
i
understood
he
was
very
here
a
big
bluff
hearty
chap
we
met
on
the
steamer
coming
over
and
became
very
good
friends
a
pause
you
will
enjoy
meeting
wall
said
his
lordship
meaningly
when
i
introduce
you
to
him
in
san
marco
lord
harrowby
said
minot
slowly
my
instructions
are
to
go
south
with
you
on
the
yacht
for
a
moment
the
two
men
stared
into
each
other
eyes
then
lord
harrowby
pursed
his
thin
lips
and
gazed
out
at
fifth
avenue
gay
and
colorful
in
the
february
sun
how
extremely
unfortunate
he
drawled
it
is
not
my
boat
minot
if
it
were
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
than
to
extend
an
invitation
to
you
i
understand
said
minot
but
i
am
to
go
invited
or
uninvited
in
my
interests
asked
harrowby
sarcastically
as
the
personal
conductor
of
the
minot
really
i
have
no
wish
to
be
rude
lord
harrowby
but
it
is
our
turn
to
be
a
little
fantastic
now
could
any
thing
be
more
fantastic
than
boarding
a
yacht
uninvited
but
miss
meyrick
on
whom
after
all
jephson
fate
depends
is
already
in
florida
with
her
lamp
trimmed
and
burning
how
sad
your
lordship
if
some
untoward
event
should
interfere
with
the
coming
of
the
bridegroom
i
perceive
smiled
lord
harrowby
that
you
do
not
share
jephson
confidence
in
my
motives
this
is
new
york
and
a
business
proposition
every
man
in
new
york
is
considered
guilty
until
he
proves
himself
innocent
and
then
we
move
for
a
new
trial
nevertheless
lord
harrowby
mouth
hardened
i
must
refuse
to
ask
you
to
join
me
on
the
would
you
mind
telling
me
where
the
boat
is
anchored
somewhere
in
the
north
river
i
believe
i
do
know
really
you
do
know
wo
it
be
a
bit
difficult
boarding
a
yacht
when
you
do
know
where
to
find
it
my
dear
chap
began
harrowby
angrily
no
matter
minot
stood
up
i
say
au
revoir
lord
harrowby
until
or
until
we
meet
in
san
marco
lord
harrowby
regained
his
good
nature
i
extremely
sorry
to
be
so
impolite
but
i
believe
going
to
be
very
good
friends
none
the
less
we
going
to
be
very
close
to
each
other
at
any
rate
minot
smiled
once
more
au
revoir
your
lordship
pardon
me
answered
lord
harrowby
with
decision
and
richard
minot
was
again
threading
his
way
between
awed
tables
walking
slowly
down
fifth
avenue
minot
was
forced
to
admit
that
he
had
not
made
a
very
auspicious
beginning
in
his
new
role
why
had
lord
harrowby
refused
so
determinedly
to
invite
him
aboard
the
yacht
that
was
to
bear
the
eager
bridegroom
south
and
what
was
he
to
do
now
might
he
not
discover
where
the
yacht
lay
board
it
at
dusk
and
conceal
himself
in
a
vacant
cabin
until
the
party
was
well
under
way
it
sounded
fairly
simple
but
it
proved
otherwise
he
was
balked
from
the
outset
for
two
hours
in
the
library
of
his
club
in
telephone
booths
and
elsewhere
he
sought
for
some
tangible
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
wealthy
american
named
martin
wall
and
a
yacht
called
the
city
directories
and
yacht
club
year
books
alike
were
silent
myth
myth
myth
ran
through
dick
minot
mind
was
lord
harrowby
as
they
say
at
the
gaiety
spoofing
him
he
mounted
to
the
top
of
a
bus
and
was
churned
up
riverside
drive
along
the
banks
of
the
river
lay
dozens
of
yachts
dismantled
swathed
in
winter
coverings
among
the
few
that
appeared
ready
to
sail
his
keen
eye
discerned
no
somewhat
discouraged
he
returned
to
his
club
and
startled
a
waiter
by
demanding
dinner
at
in
the
afternoon
going
then
to
his
rooms
he
exchanged
his
overcoat
for
a
sweater
his
hat
for
a
golf
cap
at
a
spy
for
the
first
time
in
his
eventful
young
life
he
stood
opposite
the
main
entrance
of
the
plaza
near
by
ticked
a
taxi
engaged
for
the
evening
an
hour
passed
lights
laughter
limousines
the
cold
moon
adding
its
brilliance
to
that
already
brilliant
square
the
winter
wind
sighing
through
the
bare
trees
of
the
park
new
york
seemed
a
city
of
dreams
suddenly
the
chauffeur
of
minot
taxi
stood
uneasily
before
him
say
you
ai
going
to
shoot
anybody
are
you
he
asked
oh
no
you
need
be
afraid
of
that
i
ai
afraid
i
just
thought
i
take
off
my
license
number
if
you
was
ah
yes
new
york
city
of
beautiful
dreams
another
hour
slipped
by
and
only
the
little
taxi
meter
was
busy
winking
mechanically
at
the
unresponsive
moon
at
a
tall
blond
man
in
a
very
expensive
fur
coat
which
impressed
even
the
cab
starter
came
down
the
steps
of
the
hotel
he
ordered
a
limousine
and
was
whirled
away
to
the
west
at
and
a
half
minot
followed
lord
harrowby
car
proceeded
to
the
drive
and
turning
sped
north
between
the
moonlit
river
and
the
manlit
in
the
neighborhood
of
one
hundred
and
tenth
street
it
came
to
a
stop
and
as
minot
car
passed
slowly
by
he
saw
his
lordship
standing
in
the
moonlight
paying
his
chauffeur
hastily
dismissing
his
own
car
he
ran
back
in
time
to
see
lord
harrowby
disappear
down
one
of
the
stone
stairways
into
the
gloom
of
the
park
that
skirts
the
hudson
he
followed
on
and
on
down
the
steps
and
bare
paths
he
hurried
until
finally
the
river
cold
silvery
serene
lay
before
him
some
thirty
yards
from
shore
he
beheld
the
lights
of
a
yacht
flashing
against
the
gloomy
background
of
jersey
the
he
watched
lord
harrowby
cross
the
railroad
tracks
to
a
small
landing
and
leap
from
that
into
a
boat
in
charge
of
a
solitary
rower
then
he
heard
the
soft
swish
of
oars
and
watched
the
boat
draw
away
from
shore
he
stood
there
in
the
shadow
until
he
had
seen
his
lordship
run
up
the
accommodation
ladder
to
the
deck
he
too
must
reach
the
and
at
once
but
how
he
glanced
quickly
up
and
down
the
bank
a
small
boat
was
tethered
near
by
he
ran
to
it
but
a
chain
and
padlock
held
it
firmly
he
must
hurry
aboard
the
yacht
dancing
impatiently
on
the
bosom
of
hendrick
important
discovery
he
recognized
the
preparations
for
an
early
departure
minot
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
the
wide
wet
river
it
was
february
yes
but
february
of
the
mildest
winter
new
york
had
experienced
in
years
at
the
seashore
he
had
always
dashed
boldly
in
while
others
stood
on
the
sands
and
shivered
he
dashed
in
now
the
water
was
cold
shockingly
cold
he
struck
out
swiftly
for
the
yacht
fortunately
the
accommodation
ladder
had
not
yet
been
taken
up
in
another
moment
he
was
clinging
a
limp
and
dripping
spectacle
to
the
rail
of
the
happily
that
side
of
the
deck
was
just
then
deserted
a
row
of
outside
cabin
doors
in
the
bow
met
minot
eye
stealthily
he
swished
toward
them
and
in
the
last
analysis
the
only
thing
between
him
and
them
proved
to
be
a
large
commanding
gentleman
whose
silhouette
was
particularly
militant
and
whose
whole
bearing
was
unfavorable
wall
i
presume
said
minot
through
noisy
teeth
correct
said
the
gentleman
his
voice
was
sharp
unfriendly
but
the
moonlight
falling
on
his
face
revealed
it
as
soft
genial
pudgy
the
inviting
sort
of
countenance
to
which
under
the
melting
influence
of
scotch
and
soda
one
feels
like
relating
the
sad
story
of
one
wasted
life
though
soaked
and
quaking
minot
aimed
at
nonchalance
well
he
said
you
might
be
good
enough
to
tell
lord
harrowby
that
i
arrived
who
are
you
what
do
you
want
i
a
friend
of
his
lordship
he
be
delighted
i
sure
just
tell
him
if
you
be
so
kind
did
he
invite
you
aboard
not
exactly
but
he
be
glad
to
see
me
especially
if
you
mention
just
one
word
to
him
what
word
minot
leaned
airily
against
the
rail
lloyds
he
said
an
expression
of
mingled
rage
and
dismay
came
into
the
pudgy
face
it
purpled
in
the
moonlight
its
huge
owner
came
threateningly
toward
the
dripping
minot
back
into
the
river
for
yours
he
said
savagely
almost
lovingly
so
it
might
have
seemed
to
the
casual
observer
he
wound
his
thick
arms
about
the
dripping
minot
up
and
down
the
deck
they
over
the
rail
and
into
the
river
breathed
wall
on
minot
damp
neck
two
large
and
capable
sailormen
came
at
sound
of
the
struggle
here
boys
wall
shouted
help
me
toss
this
guy
over
willing
hands
seized
minot
at
opposite
poles
one
two
counted
the
sailormen
well
good
night
wall
remarked
minot
three
a
splash
and
he
was
ingloriously
in
the
cold
river
again
he
turned
to
the
accommodation
ladder
but
quick
hands
drew
it
up
evidently
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
return
once
more
to
little
old
new
york
he
rested
for
a
moment
treading
water
seeing
dimly
the
tall
homes
of
the
cave
dwellers
and
over
them
the
yellow
glare
of
broadway
then
he
struck
out
when
he
reached
the
shore
and
turned
the
was
already
under
way
moving
slowly
down
the
silver
path
of
the
moon
an
old
man
was
launching
the
padlocked
rowboat
great
night
for
a
swim
he
remarked
sarcastically
chattered
minot
say
do
you
know
anything
about
the
yacht
that
just
steamed
out
not
as
much
as
i
like
ter
used

to
a
man
in
chicago
yesterday
the
caretaker
told
me

the
winter

him
in
a
gin
mill
with
money
to
throw

the
birds

me

this

and

suspicious
what

the
old
name
the
if
i
was

i
get
outside
a
drink
and
quick
good
night
as
minot
dashed
up
the
bank
he
heard
the
swish
of
the
old
man
oars
behind
he
ran
all
the
way
to
his
rooms
and
after
a
hot
bath
and
the
liquid
refreshment
suggested
by
the
waterman
called
thacker
on
the
telephone
well
richard
that
gentleman
inquired
sad

journeys
end
in
taxi
bills
no
matter
how
swiftly
your
train
has
sped
through
the
carolinas
and
georgia
when
it
crosses
the
line
into
florida
a
wasting
languor
overtakes
it
then
it
hesitates
sighs
and
creeps
across
the
fiat
yellow
landscape
like
an
aged
alligator
now
and
again
it
stops
completely
in
the
midst
of
nothing
as
who
should
say
you
came
down
to
see
the
south
did
you
well
look
about
you
the
palm
beach
special
on
which
minot
rode
was
no
exception
to
this
rule
it
entered
florida
and
a
state
of
innocuous
desuetude
at
one
and
the
same
time
after
a
tremendous
struggle
it
gasped
its
way
into
jacksonville
about
nine
of
the
monday
morning
following
reluctant
as
romeo
in
his
famous
exit
from
juliet
boudoir
it
got
out
of
jacksonville
an
hour
later
and
san
marco
was
just
two
hours
away
according
to
that
excellent
book
of
light
fiction
so
widely
read
in
the
south
the
it
seemed
to
dick
minot
that
he
had
been
looking
out
of
a
car
window
for
a
couple
of
eternities
save
for
the
diversion
at
jacksonville
nothing
had
happened
to
brighten
that
long
and
wearisome
journey
he
wanted
now
to
glance
across
the
car
aisle
toward
the
diversion
at
jacksonville
yet
it
hardly
seemed
polite
so
soon
wherefore
he
continued
to
gaze
out
at
the
monotonous
landscape
for
half
a
mile
the
train
served
its
masters
then
with
a
pathetic
groan
it
paused
still
minot
gazed
out
the
window
he
gazed
so
long
that
he
saw
a
family
of
passed
a
quarter
of
a
mile
back
catch
up
with
the
train
and
trot
scornfully
by
after
that
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
live
oaks
and
evergreens
to
whose
topmost
branches
hung
gray
moss
like
whiskers
on
a
western
senator
then
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
turned
and
looked
upon
the
diversion
at
jacksonville
gentlemen
of
the
jury
she
was
beautiful
the
custodian
of
a
library
of
books
on
sociology
could
have
seen
that
with
half
an
astigmatic
eye
her
hair
flashed
alluringly
in
that
sunny
car
the
curve
of
her
cheek
would
have
created
a
sensation
in
the
neighborhood
where
burning
sappho
loved
and
sang
dick
minot
heart
beat
faster
repeating
the
performance
it
had
staged
when
she
boarded
the
train
at
jacksonville
beautiful
yes
but
she
fidgeted
she
had
fidgeted
madly
in
the
station
at
jacksonville
during
that
hour
wait
now
even
more
madly
she
bounced
about
on
that
plush
seat
she
opened
and
shut
magazines
she
straightened
her
pleasant
little
hat
she
gazed
in
agony
out
the
window
beauty
such
as
hers
should
have
been
framed
in
a
serene
and
haughty
dignity
hers
happened
to
be
framed
in
a
frenzy
of
fidget
in
its
infinite
wisdom
the
train
saw
fit
to
start
again
with
a
sigh
of
relief
the
girl
sank
back
upon
her
seat
of
torture
minot
turned
again
to
the
uneventful
landscape
more
yellow
sand
more
bearded
oaks
and
evergreens
and
in
a
moment
the
family
of
plodding
along
beside
the
track
with
a
determined
demeanor
that
said
as
plainly
as
words
you
may
go
ahead
but
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
excellent
train
it
seemed
fairly
to
fly
for
a
little
while
then
another
stop
beauty
wildly
anxious
on
the
seat
of
ancient
plush
another
start
a
stop
and
a
worried
but
musical
voice
in
dick
ear
i
beg
your
pardon
but
what
should
you
say
are
this
train
chances
for
reaching
san
marco
by
one
minot
turned
brown
eyes
and
troubled
ones
looked
into
his
a
dimple
twitched
beside
an
adorable
mouth
fortunate
florida
peopled
with
girls
like
this
i
should
say
smiled
minot
about
the
same
as
those
of
the
famous
little
snowball
that
strayed
far
from
home
oh
you
right
why
would
she
fidget
so
and
i
in
a
frightfully
uncomfortable
position
i
simply
must
reach
san
marco
for
luncheon
at
one
i
must
she
clenched
her
small
hands
it
the
most
important
luncheon
of
my
life
what
shall
i
do
minot
glanced
at
his
watch
it
is
now
twenty
minutes
of
twelve
he
said
my
advice
to
you
is
to
order
lunch
on
the
train
it
was
so
foolish
of
me
cried
the
girl
i
ran
up
to
jacksonville
in
a
friend
motor
to
do
a
little
shopping
i
should
have
known
better
i
always
doing
things
like
this
and
she
looked
at
dick
minot
accusingly
as
though
it
were
he
who
always
put
her
up
to
them
i
awfully
sorry
really
minot
said
he
felt
quite
uncomfortable
about
it
and
ca
you
suggest
anything
pleadingly
almost
tearfully
not
at
this
moment
i
try
though
look
he
pointed
out
the
window
that
family
of
has
caught
up
with
us
four
times
already
what
abominable
service
the
girl
cried
but
are
they
cunning
the
little
ones
i
mean
and
she
stood
looking
out
with
a
wonderful
tenderness
in
her
eyes
which
considering
the
small
creatures
upon
which
it
was
lavished
was
almost
ludicrous
off
again
cried
minot
and
they
were
the
girl
sat
nervously
on
the
edge
of
her
seat
with
the
expression
of
one
who
meant
to
keep
the
train
going
by
mental
suggestion
five
cheerful
minutes
passed
in
rapid
transit
and
then
another
abrupt
stop
almost
like
a
football
game
said
minot
blithely
to
the
distressed
lady
across
the
aisle
third
down
five
yards
to
go
oh
by
jove
there
a
town
on
my
side
not
a
trace
of
a
town
on
mine
she
replied
it
the
dreariest
saddest
town
i
ever
saw
minot
remarked
so
of
course
its
name
is
sunbeam
and
look
what
do
you
see
there
beside
the
station
an
automobile
the
girl
cried
well
an
automobile
ancestor
at
any
rate
laughed
minot
vintage
of
say
i
have
a
suggestion
now
if
the
chauffeur
thinks
he
can
get
you
i
mean
us
to
san
marco
by
one
shall
we
but
the
girl
was
already
on
her
way
come
on
her
eyes
were
bright
with
excitement
we
oh
dear
the
old
train
started
again
no
matter
i
stop
it
minot
reached
for
the
bell
cord
but
do
you
dare
ca
you
be
arrested
too
late
i
done
it
let
me
help
you
with
those
magazines
quick
this
way
on
the
platform
they
met
an
irate
conductor
red
and
puffing
say
who
stopped
this
train
he
bellowed
i
do
know
who
usually
stops
it
minot
replied
and
he
and
the
girl
slid
by
the
uniform
to
the
safety
of
sunbeam
the
lean
lank
weary
native
who
lolled
beside
the
passé
automobile
was
startled
speechless
for
a
moment
by
the
sight
of
two
such
attractive
visitors
in
his
unattractive
town
then
he
remembered
want
a
taxi
mister
he
inquired
take
you
up
to
the
sunbeam
house
for
a
quarter
apiece
yes
we
do
want
a
taxi
minot
began
to
san
marco
cried
the
girl
breathlessly
can
you
get
us
there
by
one
to
to
say
lady
stammered
the
rustic
chauffeur
that
train
you
just
got
off
of
is
going
to
san
marco
oh
no
it
is
minot
explained
we
know
better
it
going
out
into
the
country
to
lie
down
under
a
shade
tree
and
rest
the
train
is
too
slow
said
the
girl
i
must
be
in
san
marco
before
one
can
you
get
me
us
there
by
then
speak
quickly
please
the
effect
of
this
request
on
the
chauffeur
was
to
induce
even
greater
confusion
t
to
to
san
marco
he
stumbled
w
well
say
that
a
new
one
on
me
never
had
this
car
out
o
sunbeam
yet
please
please
the
girl
pleaded
lady
said
the
chauffeur
i
do
anything
i
could
within
reason
can
you
get
us
to
san
marco
by
one
she
demanded
i
ai
no
prophet
lady
a
humorous
gleam
came
into
his
eye
but
ever
since
i
got
this
car
i
been
feelin
sort
o
reckless
if
you
say
so
i
bid
all
my
family
and
friends
and
we
take
a
chance
on
san
marco
together
that
the
spirit
laughed
minot
but
forget
the
family
and
friends
he
placed
his
baggage
in
the
front
of
the
car
and
helped
the
girl
into
the
tonneau
with
a
show
of
speed
the
countryman
went
around
to
the
front
of
the
car
and
began
to
crank
he
continued
to
crank
with
agonized
face
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
sounds
of
a
terrific
disturbance
came
from
inside
the
car
still
like
a
musician
the
man
cranked
i
say
minot
inquired
has
your
machine
got
the
sextette
from
well
there
been
a
lot
of
things
wrong
with
it
the
man
replied
but
i
do
think
it
had
that
yet
the
girl
laughed
and
such
a
laugh
dick
minot
was
sure
had
never
been
heard
in
sunbeam
before
at
that
moment
the
driver
leaped
to
his
seat
breathing
hard
and
had
it
out
with
the
wheel
exeunt
laughingly
from
sunbeam
said
minot
in
the
girl
ear
the
car
rolled
asthmatically
from
the
little
settlement
and
out
into
the
sand
and
heat
of
a
narrow
road
eight
miles
to
san
marco
said
the
driver
out
of
the
corner
of
his
mouth
sit
tight
i
going
to
let
her
out
some
again
dick
minot
glanced
at
the
girl
beside
him
fate
was
in
a
jovial
mood
to
grant
him
this
odd
ride
in
the
company
of
one
so
charming
he
could
not
have
told
what
she
wore
but
he
knew
she
was
all
in
white
and
he
realized
the
wisdom
of
white
on
a
girl
who
had
in
her
hair
and
eyes
colors
to
delight
the
most
exacting
about
her
clung
a
perfume
never
captured
in
a
bottle
her
chin
was
the
chin
of
a
girl
with
a
sense
of
humor
her
eyes
sparkled
with
the
thrill
of
their
adventure
together
and
the
dimple
in
repose
now
became
the
champion
dimple
of
the
world
minot
tried
to
think
of
some
sprightly
remark
but
his
usually
agile
tongue
remained
silent
what
was
the
matter
with
him
why
should
this
girl
seem
different
somehow
from
all
the
other
girls
he
had
ever
met
when
he
looked
into
her
eyes
a
flood
of
memories
a
little
sad
of
all
the
happy
times
he
had
ever
known
overwhelmed
him
memories
of
a
starlit
sea
the
red
and
white
awnings
of
a
yacht
the
wind
whispering
through
the
trees
on
a
hillside
an
orchestra
playing
in
the
distance
memories
of
old
and
happy
things
of
times
when
he
was
even
younger
even
more
in
love
with
life
why
should
this
be
he
wondered
and
the
girl
looking
at
him
wondered
too
was
he
suddenly
bereft
of
his
tongue
i
have
asked
you
the
conventional
question
she
said
at
last
how
do
you
like
florida
it
wonderful
is
it
minot
replied
coming
to
with
a
start
i
can
speak
of
it
even
more
enthusiastically
than
any
of
the
railroad
folders
do
and
yet
it
only
recent
my
discovery
of
its
charms
really
yes
when
i
was
surveying
it
on
that
stopwatch
of
a
train
my
impression
of
it
was
quite
unfavorable
it
seemed
so
monotonous
i
told
myself
nothing
exciting
could
ever
happen
here
and
something
has
happened
yes
something
certainly
has
happened
she
blushed
a
little
at
his
tone
young
men
usually
proposed
to
her
the
first
time
they
saw
her
why
should
she
blush
a
little
something
very
fine
minot
went
on
and
i
am
surely
very
grateful
to
fate
would
you
mind
looking
at
your
watch
please
certainly
a
quarter
after
twelve
as
i
was
saying
do
you
think
we
can
make
it
i
am
sure
of
it
you
see
it
is
so
very
important
i
want
so
very
much
to
be
there
by
one
and
i
want
you
to
i
wonder
if
you
really
knew
knew
what
nothing
i
wish
you
would
please
but
you
just
did
look
at
your
watch
did
you
they
rattled
on
down
that
road
that
was
so
sandy
so
uninteresting
so
lonely
with
only
a
garage
advertisement
here
and
there
to
suggest
a
world
outside
suddenly
the
driver
ventured
a
word
over
his
shoulder
do
worry
lady
he
said
we
get
there
sure
and
even
as
he
spoke
the
car
gave
a
roar
of
rage
and
came
to
a
dead
stop
oh
dear
what
is
it
now
cried
the
girl
acts
like
the
train
commented
minot
the
driver
got
out
and
surveyed
the
car
without
enthusiasm
i
wonder
what
she
up
to
now
he
remarked
fifteen
years
i
drove
horses
which
are
supposed
to
have
brains
but
this
machine
can
think
of
things
to
do
to
me
that
the
meanest
horse
never
could
you
promised
driver
pleaded
the
girl
we
must
reach
san
marco
on
time
er
your
watch
past
twelve
smiled
minot
the
native
descended
to
the
dust
and
slid
under
the
car
in
a
moment
he
emerged
triumphant
all
he
announced
do
you
worry
lady
it
san
marco
or
bust
if
only
something
does
bust
minot
said
again
they
were
plowing
through
the
sand
the
girl
sat
anxiously
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
her
cheeks
flaming
her
eyes
alight
minot
watched
her
and
suddenly
all
the
happy
sad
little
memories
melted
into
a
golden
glow
the
glow
of
being
alive
on
this
lonesome
road
with
her
then
suddenly
he
knew
this
was
the
one
girl
the
girl
of
all
the
world
the
girl
he
should
love
while
the
memory
of
her
lasted
which
would
be
until
the
eyes
that
looked
upon
her
now
were
dust
a
great
exultation
swept
through
him
what
did
you
mean
he
asked
when
you
said
you
were
always
doing
things
like
this
i
meant
she
answered
that
i
a
silly
little
fool
oh
if
you
could
know
me
well
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
question
the
future
you
see
for
yourself
never
looking
ahead
to
calculate
the
consequences
it
the
old
story
of
fools
rushing
in
you
mean
of
angels
rushing
in
do
you
i
never
was
good
at
old
saws
but
and
once
more
please
your
watch
twenty
minutes
of
one
oh
dear
can
we
a
wild
whoop
from
the
driver
interrupted
san
marco
he
cried
pointing
to
where
red
towers
rose
above
the
green
of
the
country
it
paid
to
take
a
chance
with
me
i
sure
did
let
her
out
where
do
you
want
to
go
lady
the
hotel
de
la
pax
said
the
girl
and
with
a
sigh
of
deep
relief
sank
back
upon
the
cushions
and
salvator
won
quoted
minot
with
a
laugh
how
can
i
ever
thank
you
the
girl
asked
do
try
said
minot
that
is
i
mean
try
if
you
will
please
it
meant
so
very
much
to
me
no
you
better
not
after
all
it
makes
me
feel
guilty
for
i
did
nothing
that
does
come
under
the
head
of
glorious
privilege
a
chance
to
serve
you
why
i
travel
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
for
that
but
it
was
good
of
you
you
can
hardly
realize
all
it
meant
to
me
to
reach
this
hotel
by
one
perhaps
i
ought
to
tell
you
it
does
matter
minot
replied
that
you
have
reached
here
is
my
reward
his
cheeks
burned
his
heart
sang
here
was
the
one
girl
and
he
built
castles
in
spain
with
lightening
strokes
she
should
be
his
she
must
be
before
him
life
stretched
glorious
with
her
at
his
side
i
think
i
will
tell
you
the
girl
was
saying
this
is
to
be
the
most
important
luncheon
of
my
life
because
yes
smiled
minot
because
it
is
the
one
at
which
i
am
going
to
announce
my
engagement
minot
heart
stopped
beating
a
hundred
castles
in
spain
came
tumbling
about
his
ears
and
the
roar
of
their
falling
deafened
him
he
put
out
his
hand
blindly
to
open
the
door
for
he
realized
that
the
car
had
come
to
a
stop
let
me
help
you
please
he
said
dully
and
even
as
he
spoke
a
horrible
possibility
swept
into
his
heart
and
overwhelmed
him
i
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
but
would
you
mind
telling
me
one
thing
of
course
not
but
i
really
must
fly
the
name
of
the
happy
man
why
allan
lord
harrowby
thank
you
so
much
and
she
was
gone
now
gone
amid
the
palms
of
that
gorgeous
hotel
courtyard
and
out
of
the
roar
that
enveloped
him
minot
heard
a
voice
dollars
mister
so
promptly
did
he
pay
this
grievous
overcharge
that
the
chauffeur
asked
hopefully
now
could
i
take
you
anywhere
sir
yes
said
minot
bitterly
take
me
back
to
new
york
well
if
i
had
a
new
front
tire
i
might
try
it
two
eager
black
boys
were
moving
inside
with
minot
bags
and
he
followed
as
he
passed
the
fountain
tinkling
gaily
in
the
courtyard
what
was
it
i
promised
thacker
he
said
to
himself
cynthia
meyrick
changes
her
mind
only
over
my
dead
body
ah
well
the
good
die
young
chapter
iv
mr
trimmer
limbers
up
at
the
desk
of
the
de
la
pax
minot
learned
that
for
fifteen
dollars
a
day
he
might
board
and
lodge
amid
the
splendors
of
that
hotel
gratefully
he
signed
his
name
one
of
the
negro
boys
who
had
matched
coins
for
him
with
the
other
boy
while
he
registered
led
the
way
to
his
room
it
proved
a
long
and
devious
journey
the
hotel
de
la
pax
was
a
series
of
afterthoughts
on
the
part
of
its
builders
up
hill
and
down
dale
the
boy
led
through
dark
passageways
over
narrow
bridges
until
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
door
of
my
boy
muttered
minot
feelingly
i
congratulate
you
henry
stanley
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
could
have
done
any
better
yes
suh
the
boy
threw
open
the
door
of
a
narrow
cell
at
the
farther
end
of
which
a
solitary
window
admitted
the
florida
sunshine
minot
stepped
over
and
glanced
out
where
the
gay
courtyard
with
its
green
palms
waving
its
fountain
tinkling
not
visible
from
instead
minot
saw
a
narrow
street
its
ancient
cobblestones
partly
obscured
by
flourishing
grass
and
bordered
by
quaint
spanish
houses
their
plaster
walls
a
hundred
colors
from
the
indignities
of
the
years
we
seem
to
have
strayed
over
into
spain
he
remarked
the
giggled
yes
suh
we
one
block
and
a
half
from
de
hotel
office
i
did
notice
any
taxis
in
the
corridors
smiled
minot
here
wait
a
minute
he
tossed
the
boy
a
coin
your
fare
back
home
if
you
get
stranded
on
the
way
telegraph
the
boy
departed
and
minot
continued
to
gaze
out
directly
across
from
his
window
looking
strangely
out
of
place
in
that
dead
and
buried
street
stood
a
great
stone
house
that
bore
on
its
front
the
sign
manhattan
club
and
grill
on
the
veranda
flush
with
the
sidewalk
and
barely
fifteen
feet
away
a
huge
man
sat
deep
in
slumber
many
and
strange
pursuits
had
claimed
the
talents
of
old
tom
stacy
manager
of
the
manhattan
club
ere
his
advent
in
san
marco
a
too
active
district
attorney
had
forced
the
new
york
police
to
take
a
keen
interest
in
his
life
and
works
hence
stacy
presence
on
that
florida
porch
but
such
troubles
were
forgot
for
the
moment
he
slumbered
peacefully
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
real
business
of
the
club
would
not
require
his
attention
until
darkness
fell
his
great
head
fell
gradually
farther
in
the
direction
of
his
generous
waist
and
while
there
is
no
authentic
evidence
to
offer
it
is
safe
to
assume
that
he
dreamed
of
broadway
suddenly
stacy
head
took
another
tilt
downward
and
his
panama
hat
slipped
off
to
the
veranda
floor
to
the
gaze
of
minot
above
there
was
revealed
a
bald
pate
extensive
and
gleaming
the
habitual
smile
fled
from
minot
face
a
feeling
of
impotent
anger
filled
his
soul
for
a
bald
head
could
recall
but
one
thing
jephson
he
strode
from
the
window
savagely
kicking
an
innocent
that
got
in
his
way
what
mean
trick
was
this
fate
had
played
him
as
he
entered
san
marco
to
show
to
him
the
one
girl
in
all
her
glory
and
sweetness
to
thrill
him
through
and
through
with
his
discovery
and
then
to
send
the
girl
scurrying
off
to
announce
her
engagement
to
another
man
scurvy
he
called
it
but
scurvier
still
that
it
should
be
the
very
engagement
he
had
hastened
to
san
marco
to
bring
to
its
proper
close
i
do
and
mendelssohn
he
sat
gloomily
down
on
the
bed
what
could
he
do
what
save
keep
his
word
given
on
the
seventeenth
floor
of
an
office
building
in
new
york
no
man
had
yet
had
reason
to
question
the
good
faith
of
a
minot
his
dead
father
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
had
sacrificed
his
fortune
to
keep
his
word
and
gone
back
with
a
smile
to
begin
all
over
again
what
could
he
do
nothing
save
grit
his
teeth
and
see
the
thing
through
he
made
up
his
mind
to
this
as
he
bathed
and
shaved
and
prepared
himself
for
his
debut
in
san
marco
so
that
when
he
finally
left
the
hotel
and
stepped
out
into
san
sebastian
avenue
he
was
cheerful
with
a
dogged
cheerfulness
a
dozen
negroes
their
smiles
reminiscent
of
tooth
powder
advertisements
vainly
sought
to
cajole
him
into
their
shaky
vehicles
with
difficulty
he
avoided
their
pleas
and
strolled
down
san
main
thoroughfare
on
every
side
clever
shopkeepers
spread
the
net
for
the
eagle
on
the
dollar
jewelers
shops
flashed
modistes
hinted
milliners
begged
to
present
their
latest
creations
he
came
presently
to
a
narrow
cross
street
where
humbler
merchants
catered
to
the
coney
instinct
that
lurks
in
even
the
most
affluent
of
tourists
there
gaudy
souvenir
stores
abounded
the
ugly
and
inevitable
alligator
fallen
from
his
proud
estate
to
fireside
slipper
wallet
cigar
case
umbrella
stand
photograph
album
and
was
in
this
street
picture
hung
in
flocks
galleries
besought
fountains
and
cheap
stood
side
by
side
and
every
few
feet
minot
came
upon
the
oldest
house
in
san
marco
on
his
way
back
to
the
hotel
in
front
of
one
of
the
more
dazzling
modiste
shops
he
saw
a
limousine
drawn
up
to
the
curb
and
in
it
jack
paddock
friend
of
his
college
days
paddock
leaped
blithely
from
the
machine
and
grasped
dick
minot
by
the
hand
you
here
he
cried
foolish
question
commented
minot
yes
i
know
said
paddock
been
here
so
long
my
brain
a
little
flabby
but
i
glad
to
see
you
old
man
same
here
minot
stared
at
the
car
i
say
jack
did
you
earn
that
writing
fiction
paddock
laughed
i
not
writing
much
fiction
now
he
replied
the
car
belongs
to
helen
bruce
the
wittiest
hostess
in
san
marco
he
came
closer
my
boy
he
confided
i
have
struck
something
essentially
soft
some
time
soon
in
a
room
with
all
the
doors
and
windows
closed
and
the
in
place
i
whisper
it
to
you
i
been
dying
to
tell
somebody
and
the
car
part
of
the
graft
dick
here
comes
bruce
now
did
i
mention
she
was
the
wittiest
of
course
i
did
want
to
meet
her
well
later
then
you
at
the
pax
i
suppose
see
you
there
minot
moved
on
from
the
imminence
of
bruce
a
moment
later
the
limousine
sped
by
him
one
seat
was
generously
filled
by
the
wittiest
hostess
in
san
marco
seated
opposite
her
paddock
waved
an
airy
hand
life
had
always
been
the
gayest
of
jokes
to
paddock
life
was
at
the
moment
quite
the
opposite
to
dick
minot
he
devoted
the
next
hour
to
sad
introspection
in
the
lobby
it
was
not
until
he
was
on
his
way
in
to
dinner
that
he
again
saw
cynthia
meyrick
then
just
outside
the
door
he
encountered
her
still
all
in
white
lovelier
than
ever
in
her
cheek
a
flush
of
excitement
no
doubt
put
there
by
the
most
important
luncheon
of
her
life
he
waited
for
her
to
recognize
him
and
he
did
not
wait
in
vain
ah
minot
of
course
in
the
hurry
of
this
noon
i
quite
overlooked
an
introduction
i
am
miss
cynthia
meyrick
i
happen
to
know
because
i
met
his
lordship
in
new
york
may
i
ask
was
the
luncheon
quite
without
a
flaw
so
you
know
lord
harrowby
er
slightly
may
i
offer
my
very
best
wishes
so
good
of
you
formal
formal
formal
was
that
how
it
must
be
between
them
hereafter
well
it
was
better
so
miss
meyrick
presented
her
father
and
her
aunt
and
that
did
not
tend
to
lighten
the
formality
icicles
both
of
them
though
stocky
puffing
icicles
aunt
inquired
if
minot
was
related
to
the
minots
of
detroit
and
when
he
failed
to
qualify
at
once
lost
all
interest
in
him
old
spencer
meyrick
did
not
accord
him
even
that
much
attention
yet
all
was
not
formal
as
it
happened
for
as
cynthia
meyrick
moved
away
she
whispered
i
must
see
you
after
dinner
on
important
business
and
her
smile
as
she
said
it
made
minot
own
lonely
dinner
quite
cheery
at
seven
in
the
evening
the
hotel
orchestra
gathered
in
the
lobby
for
its
nightly
concert
and
after
the
way
of
orchestras
it
was
almost
ready
to
begin
when
minot
left
the
at
eight
sitting
primly
in
straight
backed
chairs
an
audience
gathered
for
the
most
part
from
the
more
inexpensive
hostelries
waited
patiently
presumably
these
people
were
there
for
an
hour
with
music
lovely
maid
but
it
was
the
gowns
of
more
material
maids
that
interested
the
greater
number
of
them
and
many
drab
little
women
sat
making
furtive
mental
notes
that
should
while
away
the
hours
conversationally
when
they
got
back
to
akron
or
terre
haute
minot
sat
down
in
a
veranda
chair
and
looked
out
at
the
courtyard
in
the
splendor
of
its
evening
colors
it
was
indeed
the
setting
for
romance
in
the
midst
of
the
green
palms
and
blooming
things
splashed
a
fountain
which
might
well
have
been
the
one
old
ponce
de
leon
sought
on
three
sides
the
lighted
towers
and
turrets
of
that
huge
hotel
climbed
toward
the
bright
warm
southern
sky
a
dazzling
moon
shamed
edison
lamps
the
breeze
came
tepid
from
the
sea
the
very
latest
in
waltzes
drifted
out
from
the
gorgeous
lobby
here
romance
minot
thought
must
have
been
born
minot
i
been
looking
everywhere
she
was
beside
him
now
a
slim
white
figure
in
the
dusk
the
one
thing
lacking
in
that
glittering
picture
he
leaped
to
meet
her
sitting
here
dreaming
i
reckon
she
whispered
of
somebody
far
away
no
he
shook
his
head
i
leave
that
to
the
newly
engaged
she
made
no
answer
he
gave
her
his
chair
and
drew
up
another
for
himself
minot
she
said
i
was
terribly
thoughtless
this
noon
but
you
must
forgive
me
i
was
so
excited
minot
i
owe
you
she
hesitated
minot
bit
his
lip
savagely
must
he
hear
all
that
again
how
much
she
owed
him
for
his
service
for
getting
her
to
that
luncheon
in
time
that
wonderful
luncheon
i
owe
you
finished
the
girl
softly
the
charges
on
that
taxi
it
was
something
of
a
shock
to
minot
was
she
making
game
of
him
do
he
answered
here
in
the
moonlight
with
that
waltz
playing
and
the
old
palms
whispering
is
this
a
time
to
talk
of
taxi
bills
but
we
must
talk
of
something
oh
i
mean
i
insist
wo
you
please
tell
me
the
figure
all
the
time
we
were
together
this
morning
i
talked
figures
the
figures
on
the
face
of
a
watch
let
us
find
some
pleasanter
topic
i
believe
lord
harrowby
said
you
were
to
be
married
soon
next
tuesday
a
week
from
in
san
marco
yes
it
breaks
auntie
heart
that
it
ca
be
in
detroit
cord
harrowby
is
her
triumph
you
see
but
father
ca
go
north
in
the
winter
allan
wishes
to
be
married
at
once
minot
was
thinking
hard
so
harrowby
was
auntie
triumph
and
was
he
not
cynthia
meyrick
as
well
he
would
have
given
much
to
be
able
to
inquire
suddenly
with
the
engaging
frankness
of
a
child
the
girl
asked
has
your
engagement
ever
been
announced
mr
minot
why
er
not
to
my
knowledge
minot
laughed
why
i
was
just
wondering
if
it
made
everybody
feel
queer
the
way
it
makes
me
feel
ever
since
one
i
ought
never
to
say
it
felt
as
though
everything
was
over
i
seemed
old
old
she
clenched
her
fists
and
spoke
almost
in
terror
i
do
want
to
grow
old
i
hate
it
it
was
here
said
minot
softly
ponce
de
leon
sought
the
fountain
of
youth
when
you
came
up
i
was
pretending
the
one
splashing
out
there
was
that
very
fountain
itself
if
it
only
were
the
girl
cried
oh
you
could
never
drag
me
away
from
it
but
it
is
it
supplied
by
the
san
marco
water
works
and
there
a
meter
ticking
somewhere
i
sure
and
now
minot
i
know
you
mean
the
dollars
i
paid
our
driver
i
wish
you
would
write
me
a
check
i
a
reason
thank
you
i
wanted
to
so
much
i
bring
it
to
you
soon
she
was
gone
and
minot
sat
staring
into
the
palms
his
lips
firm
his
hands
gripping
the
arms
of
his
chair
suddenly
with
a
determined
leap
he
was
on
his
feet
a
moment
later
he
stood
at
the
telegraph
counter
in
the
lobby
writing
in
bold
flowing
characters
a
message
for
john
thacker
on
a
certain
seventeenth
floor
new
york
i
resign
will
stay
on
the
job
until
a
substitute
arrives
but
start
him
when
you
get
this
richard
minot
the
telegram
sent
he
returned
to
his
veranda
chair
to
think
thacker
would
be
upset
of
course
but
after
all
thacker
claim
on
him
was
not
such
that
he
must
wreck
his
life
happiness
to
serve
him
even
thacker
must
see
that
and
the
girl
was
she
madly
in
love
with
the
lean
and
aristocratic
harrowby
not
by
any
means
to
judge
from
her
manner
next
tuesday
a
week
what
could
happen
in
a
minot
stopped
no
that
would
do
either
even
if
a
substitute
arrived
he
could
hardly
with
honor
turn
about
and
himself
wreck
the
hopes
of
thacker
and
jephson
he
lost
either
way
it
was
a
horrible
he
cursed
beneath
his
breath
the
red
glow
of
a
cigar
near
by
drew
closer
as
the
smoker
dragged
his
chair
across
the
veranda
floor
minot
saw
behind
the
glow
the
keen
face
of
a
man
eager
for
talk
some
scene
is
it
said
the
stranger
sort
of
makes
the
musical
comedies
look
cheap
all
it
needs
is
seven
stately
chorus
ladies
walking
out
from
behind
that
palm
down
to
the
left
and
it
would
have
broadway
lashed
to
the
mast
yes
replied
minot
absently
this
is
the
real
thing
i
been
sitting
here
thinking
the
other
went
on
it
does
seem
to
me
this
place
has
been
advertised
right
why
there
are
hundreds
of
people
up
north
whose
windows
look
out
on
sunset
over
the
brewery
people
with
money
too
who
take
the
first
train
for
here
if
they
realized
the
picture
we
looking
at
now
get
some
good
hustler
to
tell
about
it
he
paused
i
hate
to
talk
about
myself
but
say
ever
hear
of
cotrell
ink
eraser
nothing
ever
written
cotrell
ca
erase
will
not
soil
or
scratch
the
paper
if
the
words
cotrell
has
erased
were
put
side
by
side
selling
it
minot
inquired
wearily
no
but
i
made
that
eraser
put
it
on
every
desk
between
new
york
and
the
rolling
oregon
after
that
i
landed
helot
bottled
sauces
and
then
patterson
lime
juice
puckered
every
mouth
in
america
advertising
is
my
specialty
so
i
gather
sure
as
you
sit
here
have
a
cigar
trimmer
is
my
name
never
mind
the
jokes
henry
trimmer
advertising
specialist
is
your
business
flabby
does
it
need
a
tonic
try
trimmer
quoting
from
my
he
leaned
closer
excuse
a
personal
question
but
did
i
see
you
talking
with
miss
cynthia
meyrick
a
while
back
possibly
mr
trimmer
came
even
closer
engaged
to
lord
harrowby
i
understand
i
believe
so
young
fellow
mr
trimmer
tone
was
exultant
i
ca
keep
in
any
longer
i
got
a
proposition
in
tow
so
big
it
bursting
my
brain
cells
and
it
takes
some
strain
to
do
that
no
i
ca
tell
you
the
exact
nature
of
it
but
i
will
say
this
night
this
time
throw
a
bomb
in
this
hotel
so
loud
it
be
heard
round
the
world
an
anarchist
not
on
your
life
advertiser
and
i
got
something
to
advertise
this
hot
february
take
it
from
me
maybe
you
a
friend
of
miss
meyrick
well
i
sorry
for
when
i
spring
my
little
surprise
i
reckon
this
harrowby
wedding
is
going
to
shrivel
up
and
fade
away
you
mean
to
say
you
you
going
to
stop
the
wedding
i
mean
to
say
nothing
watch
me
watch
henry
trimmer
just
a
tip
young
fellow
well
i
guess
i
turn
in
get
some
of
my
best
ideas
in
bed
see
you
later
and
mr
trimmer
strode
into
the
circle
of
light
a
fine
upstanding
figure
of
a
man
to
pass
triumphantly
out
of
sight
among
the
palms
dazed
dick
minot
stared
after
him
a
voice
spoke
his
name
he
turned
the
slim
white
presence
again
holding
toward
him
a
slip
of
paper
the
check
minot
dollars
is
that
correct
correct
it
splendid
because
i
never
going
to
cash
it
going
to
keep
it
really
minot
i
must
say
good
he
came
closer
thacker
and
jephson
faded
new
york
was
far
away
he
was
young
and
the
moon
was
shining
going
to
keep
it
always
the
first
letter
you
ever
wrote
me
and
the
last
minot
really
i
must
go
good
night
he
stood
alone
with
the
absurd
check
in
his
trembling
fingers
slowly
the
memory
of
trimmer
came
back
a
bomb
what
sort
of
a
bomb
well
he
had
given
his
word
there
was
no
way
out
he
must
protect
old
jephson
interests
but
might
he
not
wish
the
enemy
success
he
stared
off
in
the
direction
the
advertising
wizard
had
gone
trimmer
old
boy
he
muttered
here
to
your
pitching
arm
chapter
v
mr
trimmer
throws
his
bomb
miss
cynthia
meyrick
was
a
good
many
girls
in
one
so
many
indeed
that
it
might
truthfully
be
added
that
while
most
people
are
never
so
much
alone
as
when
in
a
crowd
miss
meyrick
was
never
so
much
in
a
crowd
as
when
alone
most
of
these
girls
were
admirable
a
few
were
more
mischievous
than
admirable
but
rely
upon
it
that
every
single
one
of
them
was
nice
it
happened
to
be
as
a
very
girl
that
miss
meyrick
opened
her
eyes
on
tuesday
morning
she
lay
for
a
long
time
watching
the
florida
sunshine
spoken
of
so
tenderly
in
the
railroad
books
as
it
danced
across
the
foot
of
her
bed
the
was
to
steam
into
san
marco
harbor
her
bridegroom
was
to
smile
his
slow
british
smile
on
her
once
more
she
recalled
these
facts
without
the
semblance
of
a
thrill
where
she
wondered
was
the
thrill
the
frivolous
girl
who
had
met
lord
harrowby
abroad
and
dazzled
by
dreams
of
social
triumphs
to
come
had
allowed
her
aunt
to
urge
her
into
this
betrothal
was
not
present
at
the
moment
had
she
been
she
would
have
declared
this
cynthia
meyrick
a
silly
and
laughed
her
into
gaiety
again
into
the
room
toddled
the
aunt
who
had
stood
so
faithfully
on
the
coaching
line
abroad
with
heavy
wit
she
spoke
of
the
coming
of
lord
harrowby
miss
cynthia
did
not
smile
she
turned
grave
eyes
on
her
aunt
i
wondering
she
confessed
was
it
the
thing
to
do
after
all
shall
i
be
so
very
happy
nonsense
out
of
a
hundred
engaged
girls
have
doubts
it
natural
aunt
mary
sat
down
on
the
bed
which
groaned
in
agony
of
course
you
be
happy
you
take
precedence
over
marion
bishop
did
we
look
that
up
and
after
the
airs
she
put
on
when
she
come
back
to
detroit
well
you
ought
to
be
the
happiest
of
girls
i
know
but
miss
meyrick
continued
to
gaze
solemnly
at
her
aunt
she
was
accustomed
to
the
apparition
to
any
one
who
knew
aunt
mary
only
in
her
public
appearances
a
view
of
her
now
would
have
been
startling
not
to
go
too
deeply
into
the
matter
she
had
not
yet
been
poured
into
the
steel
girders
that
determined
her
public
form
her
eyes
were
puffy
and
her
gray
hair
was
not
so
luxurious
as
it
would
be
when
she
appeared
in
the
hotel
for
lunch
there
she
sat
a
fat
little
lump
of
a
woman
who
had
all
her
life
chased
but
what
she
demanded
firmly
it
seems
as
if
all
my
fun
were
over
did
you
feel
that
way
when
you
became
engaged
hardly
but
then
i
had
enjoyed
everything
money
will
buy
as
you
have
i
always
said
you
had
too
much
there
dear
cheer
up
you
do
seem
to
realize
why
i
can
remember
when
you
were
born
in
the
flat
down
on
second
street
and
your
father
wearing
his
old
overcoat
another
year
to
pay
the
doctor
bill
and
now
that
little
fluffy
baby
is
to
marry
into
the
peerage
bless
you
how
proud
your
mother
would
be
had
she
lived
are
you
sure
aunt
mary
positive
aunt
mary
eyes
filled
and
with
a
show
of
real
if
clumsy
affection
she
leaned
over
and
kissed
her
niece
come
dear
get
up
i
ordered
breakfast
in
the
rooms
miss
cynthia
sat
up
and
as
if
banished
by
that
act
the
serious
little
mouse
of
a
girl
scampered
into
oblivion
and
in
her
place
appeared
a
gay
young
rogue
who
sees
the
future
lying
bright
ahead
after
all
she
smiled
i
not
married
yet
and
humming
brightly
from
a
current
musical
comedy
not
just
yet
just
yet
just
yet
she
stretched
forth
one
slim
white
arm
to
throw
aside
the
coverlet
at
which
point
it
is
best
discreetly
to
withdraw
minot
after
a
lonesome
if
abundant
breakfast
was
at
this
moment
strolling
across
the
hotel
courtyard
toward
yesterday
morning
new
york
papers
as
he
walked
the
pert
promises
of
mr
trimmer
filled
his
mind
what
was
the
proposition
mr
trimmer
had
in
tow
how
would
it
affect
the
approaching
wedding
and
what
course
of
action
should
the
representative
of
jephson
pursue
when
it
was
revealed
for
in
the
sensible
light
of
morning
dick
minot
realized
that
while
he
remained
in
san
marco
as
the
guardian
of
jephson
interests
he
must
do
his
duty
adorable
miss
meyrick
might
be
but
any
change
of
mind
on
her
part
must
be
over
his
dead
body
a
promise
was
a
promise
with
this
resolve
firm
he
proceeded
along
the
hot
sidewalk
of
san
sebastian
avenue
on
his
right
the
rich
shops
again
a
dignified
spanish
church
as
old
as
the
town
a
rambling
lackadaisical
on
his
left
the
green
and
sand
colored
plaza
with
the
old
spanish
governor
house
in
the
center
now
serving
uncle
sam
as
a
city
of
the
past
was
this
other
times
other
manners
breathed
in
the
air
at
the
minot
met
jack
paddock
jaunty
with
a
gardenia
in
his
buttonhole
and
the
atmosphere
of
prosperity
that
goes
with
it
come
for
a
stroll
paddock
suggested
i
presume
you
want
the
giddy
story
of
my
life
i
promised
you
yesterday
been
down
to
the
old
spanish
fort
yet
no
come
ahead
and
there
on
the
ramparts
impart
they
went
down
the
narrow
and
very
modern
street
of
the
souvenir
venders
suddenly
the
street
ended
and
they
walked
again
in
the
past
the
remnants
of
the
old
city
gates
restored
loomed
in
the
sunlight
they
stepped
through
the
portals
and
minot
gave
a
gasp
there
in
the
quiet
morning
stood
the
great
gray
fort
that
the
early
settlers
had
built
to
protect
themselves
from
the
gay
dogs
who
roamed
the
seas
its
massive
walls
spoke
clearly
of
romance
of
bloody
days
of
cutlass
and
spike
of
bandaged
heads
and
ready
arms
such
things
still
stood
still
stood
in
the
united
states
land
of
steam
radiators
and
men
who
marched
in
suffrage
parades
the
old
caretaker
let
them
in
and
they
went
up
the
stone
steps
to
stand
at
last
on
the
parapet
looking
down
on
the
shimmering
sea
to
minot
fresh
from
broadway
it
all
seemed
like
a
colorful
dream
they
climbed
to
the
highest
point
and
sat
swinging
their
legs
over
the
edge
far
below
the
bright
blue
waters
broke
on
the
lower
walls
it
a
funny
country
down
here
paddock
said
slowly
a
sort
of
place
bright
and
gay
and
full
of
green
palms
and
so
much
like
a
musical
comedy
you
keep
waiting
all
the
time
for
the
curtain
to
go
down
and
the
male
population
to
begin
its
march
up
the
aisle
i
been
here
three
months
and
i
do
yet
think
it
really
true
he
shifted
on
the
cold
stones
ever
since
white
men
hit
on
it
he
went
on
it
sort
of
kept
luring
them
here
on
fool
dream
hunts
like
a
woman
along
about
the
time
old
ponce
de
leon
came
over
here
prospecting
for
the
fountain
that
nobody
but
lillian
russell
has
located
yet
another
spaniard
i
forget
his
name
had
a
pipe
dream
too
he
came
over
looking
for
a
mountain
of
gold
he
dreamed
was
here
i
sorry
for
that
old
boy
sorry
for
him
repeated
minot
yes
sorry
he
had
the
right
idea
but
he
arrived
several
hundred
years
too
soon
he
should
have
waited
until
the
yellow
rich
from
the
north
showed
up
here
then
he
have
found
his
mountain
he
have
found
a
whole
range
of
them
i
suppose
i
to
infer
minot
said
that
where
he
failed
landed
yes
dick
i
am
right
on
the
mountain
with
my
little
alpenstock
in
hand
i
sorry
replied
minot
frankly
you
might
have
amounted
to
something
if
you
been
separated
from
money
long
enough
so
i
heard
paddock
said
with
a
yawn
but
it
was
to
be
i
have
seen
you
since
we
left
college
have
i
well
dick
for
a
couple
of
years
i
tried
to
make
good
doing
fiction
i
turned
them
out
by
the
yard
nice
quiet
little
yarns
with
snappy
dialogue
once
i
got
eighty
dollars
for
a
story
it
was
hard
work
and
i
always
did
yearn
for
the
purple
you
know
i
know
said
minot
gravely
well
i
struck
it
dick
i
struck
the
deep
purple
with
a
loud
if
sickening
thud
hist
the
graft
i
mentioned
yesterday
he
glanced
over
his
shoulder
remember
bruce
the
wittiest
hostess
in
san
marco
of
course
i
do
well
i
write
her
repartee
for
her
her
what
her
repartee
her
dialogue
the
bright
talk
she
convulses
dinner
tables
with
instead
of
putting
my
smart
stuff
into
stories
at
eighty
per
i
sell
it
to
bruce
at
i
be
ashamed
to
tell
you
old
man
i
remarked
that
it
was
essentially
soft
it
is
this
is
a
new
one
on
me
said
minot
dazed
a
delighted
smile
spread
over
paddock
handsome
face
thanks
that
the
beauty
of
it
i
a
pioneer
there
be
others
but
i
was
the
first
consider
the
situation
here
bruce
loaded
with
diamonds
and
money
but
in
company
with
a
wit
developed
in
zanesville
ohio
bright
but
struggling
young
author
comes
to
her
offers
to
make
her
conversation
the
sensation
of
the
place
for
a
few
pesos
you
did
that
yes
i
ask
posterity
to
remember
it
was
i
who
invented
the
graft
bruce
fell
on
my
fair
young
neck
now
she
gives
me
in
advance
a
list
of
her
engagements
and
for
the
important
ones
i
devise
her
line
of
talk
then
as
i
usually
present
at
the
occasion
i
swing
things
round
for
her
and
give
her
her
cues
if
i
not
there
she
has
to
manage
it
herself
it
a
great
life
only
a
bit
of
a
strain
on
me
i
have
to
remember
not
to
be
clever
in
company
if
i
forget
and
spring
a
good
one
she
jumps
on
me
proper
afterward
for
not
giving
it
to
her
jack
said
minot
slowly
come
way
from
here
with
me
come
north
this
place
will
finish
you
sure
sorry
old
man
laughed
paddock
but
i
had
a
nip
of
the
lotus
this
lazy
old
land
suits
me
i
like
to
sit
on
a
veranda
while
a
dusky
menial
in
a
white
coat
hands
me
the
in
a
tall
cool
glass
come
away
oh
no
i
could
do
that
you
marry
down
here
sighed
minot
some
girl
with
money
and
the
career
we
all
hoped
you
make
for
yourself
will
go
up
in
a
golden
cloud
i
met
a
girl
paddock
replied
half
closing
his
eyes
and
smiling
cynically
at
the
sea
little
thing
from
the
middle
west
stopping
at
a
back
street
father
in
the
hardware
business
nobody
at
all
but
eyes
like
the
sea
there
hands
like
butterflies
sort
of
got
me
that
how
i
happen
to
know
i
never
marry
for
if
i
married
anybody
it
would
have
to
be
her
and
i
let
her
go
home
without
saying
a
word
because
i
was
selfish
and
like
this
easy
game
and
intend
to
stick
to
it
until
i
smothered
in
shall
we
wander
back
see
here
jack
i
do
want
to
preach
minot
tried
to
conceal
his
seriousness
with
a
smile
but
if
i
were
you
i
stick
to
this
girl
and
make
good
and
leave
this
paddock
laughed
dick
you
old
idiot
this
is
meat
and
drink
to
me
this
nice
old
land
of
loiter
in
the
sun
nay
nay
now
i
really
got
to
get
back
bruce
is
giving
a
tango
tea
this
afternoon
informal
but
something
has
to
be
said
these
fellows
who
write
a
daily
humorous
column
must
lead
a
devil
of
a
life
with
a
laugh
minot
followed
his
irresponsible
friend
down
the
steps
they
crossed
the
bridge
over
the
empty
moat
and
came
through
the
city
gates
again
to
the
street
of
the
alligator
by
the
way
paddock
said
as
they
went
up
the
hotel
steps
you
have
told
me
what
brought
you
south
business
jack
said
minot
it
a
secret
perhaps
i
can
tell
you
later
business
i
thought
of
course
you
came
for
pleasure
there
be
no
pleasure
in
this
trip
for
me
said
minot
bitterly
oh
wo
there
paddock
laughed
wait
till
you
hear
bruce
talk
see
you
later
old
man
at
luncheon
they
brought
minot
a
telegram
from
a
certain
seventeenth
floor
in
new
york
an
explosive
telegram
it
read
nonsense
nobody
here
to
take
your
place
see
it
through
you
given
your
word
thacker
gloomily
minot
considered
what
was
there
to
do
but
see
it
through
even
though
thacker
should
send
another
to
take
his
place
could
he
stay
to
woo
the
lady
he
adored
hardly
in
that
event
he
would
have
to
go
away
never
see
her
again
never
hear
her
voice
if
he
stayed
as
jephson
representative
he
might
know
the
glory
of
her
nearness
for
a
week
might
thrill
at
her
smile
even
while
he
worked
to
wed
her
to
lord
harrowby
and
perhaps
who
could
say
hard
as
he
might
work
might
he
not
be
thwarted
it
was
possible
so
after
lunch
he
sent
thacker
a
reassuring
message
promising
to
stay
and
at
the
end
of
a
dull
hour
in
the
lobby
he
set
out
to
explore
the
town
the
mermaid
tea
house
stood
on
the
waterfront
with
a
small
balcony
that
looked
out
on
the
harbor
passing
that
way
at
that
afternoon
minot
heard
a
voice
call
to
him
he
glanced
up
oh
minot
wo
you
come
into
my
parlor
cynthia
meyrick
smiled
down
on
him
splendid
minot
laughed
i
walk
forlorn
through
this
old
spanish
town
suddenly
a
lattice
is
thrown
wide
a
fair
hand
beckons
i
dash
within
thanks
for
dashing
miss
meyrick
greeted
him
on
the
balcony
i
was
finding
it
dreadfully
dull
but
i
afraid
the
spanish
romance
is
a
little
lacking
there
is
no
moonlight
no
lattice
no
mantilla
no
spanish
beauty
no
matter
minot
answered
i
never
did
care
for
spanish
types
they
flash
like
a
then
tumble
in
the
dark
now
the
girls
and
nothing
but
tea
she
interrupted
will
you
have
a
cup
thanks
was
it
really
very
dull
yes
this
book
was
to
blame
she
held
up
a
novel
what
the
matter
with
it
oh
it
one
of
those
books
in
which
the
hero
and
heroine
are
forever
into
each
other
eyes
and
they
understand
perfectly
but
the
reader
does
i
reached
one
of
those
gazing
matches
now
but
is
it
so
in
real
life
when
people
gaze
into
each
other
eyes
do
they
usually
understand
do
they
do
they
you
surely
have
had
more
experience
than
i
what
makes
you
think
so
she
smiled
because
your
eyes
are
so
very
easy
to
gaze
into
minot
you
gazing
into
them
brazenly
and
neither
of
us
do
we
oh
no
we
both
completely
at
sea
there
she
cried
triumphantly
i
told
you
these
authors
were
all
wrong
minot
having
begun
to
gaze
found
difficulty
in
stopping
she
was
near
she
was
beautiful
and
a
promise
made
in
new
york
was
a
dim
and
distant
thing
the
railroad
folders
try
to
make
you
believe
florida
is
an
annex
to
heaven
he
said
i
used
to
think
they
were
lying
but
she
blushed
but
what
mr
minot
he
leaned
close
a
strange
light
in
his
eyes
he
opened
his
mouth
to
speak
suddenly
he
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
the
light
died
from
his
eyes
his
lips
set
in
a
bitter
curve
nothing
he
said
a
silence
minot
you
grown
awfully
dull
have
i
i
sorry
must
i
go
back
to
my
book
she
was
interrupted
by
the
shrill
triumphant
cry
of
a
yacht
siren
at
her
back
she
turned
her
head
the
she
said
exactly
said
minot
the
bridegroom
cometh
another
silence
you
want
to
go
to
meet
him
minot
said
rising
he
stood
looking
at
the
boat
flashing
gaily
in
the
sunshine
i
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
street
but
you
know
lord
harrowby
meet
him
with
me
it
seems
hardly
the
thing
but
i
not
sentimental
and
surely
allan
not
then
i
must
be
said
minot
really
i
rather
not
they
went
together
to
the
street
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
minot
turned
to
her
i
promised
lord
harrowby
in
new
york
he
told
her
that
you
would
have
your
lamp
trimmed
and
burning
she
looked
up
at
him
a
mischievous
light
came
into
her
eyes
please
have
you
a
match
she
asked
it
was
too
much
minot
turned
and
fled
down
the
street
he
did
not
once
look
back
though
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
felt
every
step
the
girl
took
across
that
narrow
pier
to
her
fiancé
side
as
he
dressed
for
dinner
that
night
his
telephone
rang
and
miss
meyrick
voice
sounded
over
the
wire
harrowby
remembers
you
very
pleasantly
wo
you
join
us
at
dinner
are
you
sure
an
outsider
he
began
nonsense
martin
wall
is
to
be
there
ah
thank
you
i
be
delighted
minot
replied
in
the
lobby
harrowby
seized
his
hand
my
dear
chap
you
looking
fit
great
to
see
you
again
by
the
way
do
you
know
martin
wall
yes
wall
and
i
met
just
before
the
splash
minot
smiled
he
shook
hands
with
wall
unaccountably
genial
and
beaming
the
hudson
wall
is
a
bit
chilly
in
february
my
dear
fellow
said
wall
can
you
ever
forgive
me
a
thousand
apologies
it
was
all
a
mistake
a
horrible
mistake
i
felt
like
a
rotter
when
i
heard
about
it
harrowby
put
in
martin
mistook
you
for
some
one
else
you
must
forgive
us
both
freely
said
minot
and
i
want
to
apologize
for
my
suspicions
of
you
lord
harrowby
thanks
old
chap
i
never
doubted
you
would
come
after
i
saw
miss
meyrick
she
is
a
ripper
is
she
said
harrowby
enthusiastically
martin
wall
shot
a
quick
almost
hostile
glance
at
minot
you
noticed
that
yourself
have
you
he
said
in
minot
ear
at
which
point
the
meyrick
family
arrived
and
they
all
went
in
to
dinner
that
function
could
hardly
be
described
as
hilarious
aunt
mary
fluttered
and
gasped
in
her
triumph
and
spoke
often
of
her
horror
of
the
new
the
recent
admission
of
automobiles
to
the
sacred
precincts
of
bar
harbor
seemed
to
be
the
great
and
disturbing
fact
in
life
for
her
spencer
meyrick
said
little
his
thoughts
were
far
away
the
rush
and
scramble
of
a
business
office
the
click
of
typewriters
the
excitement
of
the
dollar
chase
these
things
had
been
his
life
deprived
of
them
like
many
another
exile
in
the
south
he
moved
in
a
dim
world
of
unrealities
and
wished
that
he
were
home
minot
too
had
little
to
say
on
martin
wall
fell
the
burden
of
entertainment
and
he
bore
it
as
one
trained
for
the
work
blithely
he
gossiped
of
queer
corners
that
had
known
him
and
amid
the
flow
of
his
oratory
the
dinner
progressed
it
was
after
dinner
when
they
all
stood
together
in
the
lobby
a
moment
before
separating
that
henry
trimmer
made
good
his
promise
out
of
a
clear
sky
cynthia
meyrick
stood
facing
the
others
talking
brightly
when
suddenly
her
face
paled
and
the
flippant
words
died
on
her
lips
they
all
turned
instantly
through
the
lobby
in
a
buzz
of
excited
comment
a
man
walked
slowly
his
eyes
on
the
ground
he
was
a
tall
blond
englishman
not
unlike
lord
harrowby
in
appearance
his
gray
eyes
when
he
raised
them
for
a
moment
were
listless
his
shoulders
stooped
and
weary
and
he
had
a
long
drooping
mustache
that
hung
like
a
weeping
willow
above
a
particularly
cheerless
stream
however
it
was
not
his
appearance
that
excited
comment
and
caused
miss
meyrick
to
pale
hung
over
his
shoulders
was
a
pair
of
sandwich
boards
such
as
the
outcasts
of
a
great
city
carry
up
and
down
the
streets
and
on
the
front
board
turned
full
toward
miss
meyrick
dinner
party
was
printed
in
bold
black
letters
i
am
the
real
lord
harrowby
with
a
little
gasp
and
a
murmured
apology
miss
meyrick
turned
quickly
and
entered
the
elevator
lord
harrowby
stood
like
a
man
of
stone
gazing
at
the
sandwich
boards
it
was
at
this
point
that
the
hotel
detective
sufficiently
recovered
himself
to
lay
eager
hands
on
the
audacious
sandwich
man
and
propel
him
violently
from
the
scene
in
the
background
minot
perceived
henry
trimmer
puffing
excitedly
on
a
big
black
cigar
a
triumphant
look
on
his
face
mr
trimmer
bomb
was
thrown
chapter
vi
ten
minutes
of
agony
all
i
ask
mister
harrowby
is
that
you
consent
to
a
short
interview
with
your
brother
mr
trimmer
was
speaking
the
time
was
noon
of
the
following
day
and
trimmer
faced
lord
harrowby
in
the
of
his
lordship
hotel
suite
also
present
at
harrowby
invitation
were
martin
wall
and
minot
his
lordship
turned
his
gray
eyes
on
trimmer
eager
face
he
could
make
those
eyes
fishy
when
he
liked
he
made
them
so
now
he
is
not
my
brother
he
said
coldly
and
i
shall
not
see
him
may
i
ask
you
not
to
call
me
mr
harrowby
you
may
ask
till
you
red
in
your
noble
face
replied
trimmer
firm
in
his
disrespect
but
i
shall
go
on
calling
you
just
the
same
i
call
you
that
because
i
know
the
facts
just
as
i
call
your
poor
cheated
brother
who
was
in
this
hotel
last
night
between
sandwich
boards
lord
harrowby
really
said
his
lordship
i
see
no
occasion
for
prolonging
this
interview
mr
trimmer
leaned
forward
he
was
a
big
man
but
his
face
was
incongruously
thin
almost
the
very
best
sort
of
face
to
thrust
in
anywhere
and
trimmer
was
the
very
man
to
do
the
thrusting
without
batting
an
eye
do
you
deny
he
demanded
with
the
air
of
a
prosecutor
that
you
had
an
older
brother
by
the
name
of
george
i
certainly
do
not
answered
lord
harrowby
george
ran
off
to
america
some
years
ago
he
died
in
a
mining
camp
in
arizona
twelve
years
back
there
is
no
question
whatever
about
that
we
had
it
on
the
most
reliable
authority
a
lot
of
lies
said
trimmer
can
be
had
on
good
authority
this
situation
illustrates
that
do
you
think
harrowby
that
i
be
wasting
my
time
on
this
proposition
if
i
was
dead
sure
of
my
facts
why
poor
old
george
has
the
evidence
in
his
possession
incontrovertible
proofs
it
would
hurt
you
to
see
him
and
look
over
what
he
has
to
offer
your
lordship
minot
suggested
you
know
that
i
am
your
friend
and
that
my
great
desire
is
to
see
you
happily
married
next
week
in
order
that
nothing
may
happen
to
prevent
i
think
you
ought
to
see
this
impostor
cut
in
his
lordship
haughtily
no
i
can
not
this
is
not
the
first
time
adventurers
have
questioned
the
harrowby
title
the
dignity
of
our
family
demands
that
i
refuse
to
take
any
notice
whatsoever
go
on
sneered
trimmer
hide
behind
your
dignity
when
i
get
through
with
you
you
wo
have
enough
left
to
conceal
your
trimmer
said
martin
wall
speaking
for
the
first
time
how
much
money
do
you
want
mr
trimmer
kept
his
temper
admirably
your
society
has
not
corrupted
me
wall
he
said
sweetly
i
am
not
a
blackmailer
i
am
simply
a
publicity
man
i
working
on
a
salary
which
lord
harrowby
the
real
lord
harrowby
is
to
pay
me
when
he
comes
into
his
own
i
handled
successfully
in
publicity
campaigns
prima
donnas
pills
erasers
perfumes
holding
companies
race
horses
soups
and
society
leaders
it
is
likely
that
i
shall
fall
down
on
this
proposition
for
the
last
time
allan
harrowby
will
you
see
your
brother
lord
harrowby
if
i
were
you
minot
began
my
dear
fellow
his
lordship
raised
one
slim
hand
it
is
quite
impossible
which
i
take
it
terminates
our
talk
with
mr
trimmer
yes
said
mr
trimmer
rising
except
for
one
thing
our
young
friend
here
when
he
urges
you
to
grant
my
request
is
giving
a
correct
imitation
of
a
wise
head
on
youthful
shoulders
he
an
american
and
he
knows
about
me
about
henry
trimmer
i
guess
you
never
heard
harrowby
what
i
did
for
cotrell
ink
eraser
come
on
said
wall
militantly
erase
yourself
for
the
moment
i
will
smiled
mr
trimmer
but
i
warn
you
harrowby
you
are
going
to
be
sorry
you
are
up
against
any
piker
in
publicity
no
siree
that
little
stunt
of
mine
last
night
was
just
a
starter
i
going
to
take
the
public
into
partnership
put
it
up
to
the
people
that
my
motto
good
day
sir
snapped
lord
harrowby
put
it
up
to
the
people
and
when
i
pull
off
the
little
trick
i
thought
of
this
morning
you
going
to
get
down
before
me
on
your
noble
knees
and
beg
off
i
warn
you
good
day
gentlemen
and
may
i
add
one
simple
request
on
parting
watch
trimmer
he
went
out
slamming
the
door
behind
him
wall
rose
and
walked
rapidly
toward
a
decanter
rather
tough
on
you
lord
harrowby
he
remarked
pouring
himself
a
drink
especially
just
now
the
fresh
bounder
ought
to
have
been
kicked
out
of
the
room
an
impostor
snorted
harrowby
a
rank
impostor
of
course
wall
set
down
his
glass
but
do
worry
if
trimmer
gets
too
obstreperous
i
take
care
of
him
myself
i
guess
i
be
going
back
to
the
yacht
after
wall
departure
minot
and
harrowby
sat
staring
at
each
other
for
a
long
moment
see
here
your
lordship
said
minot
at
last
you
know
why
i
in
san
marco
that
wedding
next
tuesday
must
take
place
without
fail
and
i
ca
say
that
i
approve
of
your
action
just
now
my
dear
boy
harrowby
interrupted
soothingly
i
appreciate
your
position
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
gained
by
seeing
mr
friend
the
meyricks
were
distressed
naturally
by
that
ridiculous
affair
last
evening
but
they
have
made
no
move
to
call
off
the
wedding
on
account
of
it
the
best
thing
to
do
i
sure
is
to
let
matters
take
their
course
i
might
be
able
to
prove
that
claims
false
and
then
again
i
might
even
if
i
knew
they
were
false
and
there
is
a
third
possibility
what
is
that
he
might
really
be
george
but
you
said
your
brother
died
twelve
years
ago
that
is
what
we
heard
but
one
can
not
be
sure
and
delighted
as
i
should
be
to
know
that
george
is
alive
naturally
i
should
prefer
to
know
it
after
next
tuesday
anger
surged
into
minot
heart
is
that
fair
to
the
young
lady
who
who
is
to
become
my
wife
lord
harrowby
waved
his
hand
it
is
miss
meyrick
is
not
marrying
me
for
my
title
as
for
her
father
and
aunt
i
can
not
be
so
sure
i
want
no
disturbance
you
want
none
i
am
sure
it
is
better
to
let
things
take
their
course
all
right
said
minot
only
i
intend
to
do
every
thing
in
my
power
to
put
this
wedding
through
my
dear
chap
your
cause
is
mine
answered
his
lordship
minot
returned
to
the
narrow
confines
of
his
room
on
the
bureau
where
he
had
thrown
it
earlier
in
the
day
lay
an
invitation
to
dine
that
night
with
bruce
thus
was
jack
paddock
hand
shown
the
dinner
was
to
be
in
miss
meyrick
honor
and
minot
was
not
sorry
he
was
to
go
he
took
up
the
invitation
and
reread
it
smilingly
so
he
was
to
hear
bruce
at
her
own
table
the
wittiest
hostess
in
san
marco
bar
none
the
drowsiness
of
a
florida
midday
was
in
the
air
minot
lay
down
on
his
bed
a
hundred
thoughts
were
his
the
brown
of
miss
eyes
the
sincerity
of
mr
trimmer
voice
when
he
spoke
of
his
proposition
the
fishy
look
of
lord
harrowby
refusing
to
meet
his
long
lost
brother
things
grew
hazy
minot
slept
on
leaving
lord
harrowby
rooms
martin
wall
did
not
immediately
set
out
for
the
on
which
he
lived
in
preference
to
the
hotel
instead
he
took
a
brisk
turn
about
the
spacious
lobby
of
the
de
la
pax
people
turned
to
look
at
him
as
he
passed
they
noted
that
his
large
placid
rather
jovial
face
was
lighted
by
an
eye
sharp
and
queer
and
a
bit
out
of
place
amid
its
surroundings
wall
considered
himself
the
true
cosmopolite
and
his
history
rather
bore
out
the
boast
many
and
odd
were
the
lands
that
had
known
him
he
had
loaned
money
to
a
prince
of
algiers
on
excellent
security
broken
bread
with
a
sultan
organized
a
baseball
nine
in
cuba
and
coming
home
from
the
east
via
the
indian
ports
had
flirted
on
shipboard
with
the
wife
of
a
russian
grand
duke
as
he
passed
through
that
cool
lobby
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
that
middle
west
merchants
and
their
wives
found
him
worthy
of
a
second
glance
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
de
la
pax
was
fringed
by
a
series
of
modish
shops
with
doors
opening
both
on
the
courtyard
and
on
the
narrow
street
outside
among
these
occupying
a
corner
room
was
the
very
smart
jewel
shop
of
ostby
and
blake
occasionally
in
the
winter
resorts
of
the
south
one
may
find
jewelry
shops
whose
stock
would
bear
favorably
competition
with
fifth
avenue
ostby
and
blake
conducted
such
an
establishment
for
a
moment
before
the
of
this
shop
wall
paused
and
with
the
eye
of
a
connoisseur
studied
the
brilliant
display
within
his
whole
manner
changed
the
air
of
boredom
with
which
he
had
surveyed
his
fellow
travelers
of
the
lobby
disappeared
on
the
instant
he
was
alert
alive
almost
eager
jauntily
he
strolled
into
the
store
one
clerk
only
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
sallow
complexion
and
hair
the
color
of
a
lemon
was
in
charge
wall
asked
to
be
shown
the
stock
of
unset
diamonds
the
trays
that
the
man
set
before
him
caused
the
eyes
of
wall
to
brighten
still
more
with
a
manner
almost
reverent
he
stooped
over
and
passed
his
fingers
lovingly
over
the
stones
for
an
instant
the
tall
man
glanced
outside
and
smiled
a
sallow
smile
a
little
girl
in
a
pink
dress
was
crossing
the
street
and
it
was
at
her
that
he
smiled
there
a
flaw
in
that
stone
said
wall
in
a
voice
of
sorrow
see
from
outside
came
the
shrill
scream
of
a
child
interrupting
the
tall
man
turned
quickly
to
the
window
my
god
he
moaned
what
is
it
wall
sought
to
look
over
his
shoulder
automobile
my
little
girl
cried
the
clerk
in
agony
he
turned
to
martin
wall
hesitating
his
sallow
face
was
white
now
his
lips
trembled
doubtfully
he
gazed
into
the
frank
open
countenance
of
martin
wall
and
then
i
leave
you
in
charge
he
shouted
and
fled
past
wall
to
the
street
for
a
moment
martin
wall
stood
frozen
to
the
spot
his
eyes
were
unbelieving
his
little
cupid
bow
mouth
was
wide
open
here
come
back
he
shouted
when
he
could
find
his
voice
no
one
heeded
no
one
heard
outside
in
the
street
a
crowd
had
gathered
martin
wall
wet
his
dry
lips
with
his
tongue
an
unaccountable
shudder
swept
his
huge
frame
my
god
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
terror
i
alone
for
the
first
time
he
dared
to
move
his
elbow
bumped
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
worth
of
unset
diamonds
frightened
he
drew
back
he
collided
with
a
rich
in
emeralds
rubies
and
aquamarines
he
put
out
a
plump
hand
to
steady
himself
it
rested
on
a
display
case
of
french
russian
and
dutch
silver
wall
knees
grew
weak
he
felt
a
strange
prickly
sensation
all
over
him
he
took
a
step
and
was
staring
at
the
finest
display
of
black
pearls
south
of
maiden
lane
new
york
quickly
he
turned
away
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
door
of
a
huge
safety
vault
it
was
swinging
open
little
beads
of
perspiration
began
to
pop
out
on
the
forehead
of
martin
wall
his
heart
was
hammering
like
that
of
a
youth
who
sees
after
a
long
separation
his
lady
love
his
eyes
grew
glassy
he
took
out
a
silk
handkerchief
and
passed
it
slowly
across
his
damp
forehead
staggering
slightly
he
stepped
again
to
the
trays
of
unset
stones
the
glassy
eyes
had
grown
greedy
now
he
put
out
one
huge
hand
as
the
lover
aforesaid
might
reach
toward
his
lady
hair
then
wall
shut
his
lips
firmly
and
thrust
both
of
his
hands
deep
into
his
trousers
pockets
he
stood
there
in
the
middle
of
that
gorgeous
room
a
fat
figure
of
a
man
suffering
a
cruel
inhuman
agony
he
was
still
standing
thus
when
the
tall
man
came
running
back
apprehension
clouded
that
sallow
face
it
was
very
kind
of
you
the
small
eyes
of
the
clerk
darted
everywhere
then
came
back
to
martin
wall
i
obliged
why
the
matter
sir
martin
wall
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
a
man
banishing
a
terrible
dream
the
little
girl
he
asked
hardly
a
scratch
said
the
clerk
pointing
to
the
smiling
child
at
his
side
it
was
lucky
was
it
he
was
behind
the
counter
now
studying
the
trays
unprotected
on
the
very
lucky
martin
wall
still
had
to
steady
himself
perhaps
like
to
look
about
a
bit
before
i
go
oh
no
sir
everything
all
right
i
sure
you
were
looking
at
these
stones
some
other
time
said
wall
weakly
i
only
wanted
an
idea
of
what
you
had
good
day
sir
and
thank
you
very
much
not
at
all
and
the
limp
passed
unsteadily
from
the
store
into
the
glare
of
the
street
tom
stacy
of
the
manhattan
club
half
dozing
on
the
veranda
of
his
establishment
was
rejoiced
to
see
his
old
friend
martin
wall
crossing
the
pavement
toward
him
well
martin
he
began
and
then
a
look
of
concern
came
into
his
face
good
lord
man
what
ails
you
wall
sank
like
a
wet
rag
to
the
steps
tom
he
said
a
terrible
thing
has
just
happened
i
was
left
alone
in
ostby
and
blake
jewelry
shop
alone
cried
stacy
you
alone
absolutely
alone
stacy
leaned
over
are
you
leaving
town
in
a
hurry
he
asked
gloomily
wall
shook
his
head
he
put
me
on
my
honor
he
complained
left
me
in
charge
of
the
shop
can
you
beat
it
of
course
after
that
i
well
you
know
somehow
i
could
do
it
i
tried
but
i
could
stacy
threw
back
his
head
and
his
raucous
laughter
smote
the
lazy
summer
afternoon
i
ca
help
it
he
gasped
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
you
the
best
stone
thief
in
america
alone
in
charge
of
three
million
worth
of
the
stuff
good
heavens
man
whispered
wall
not
so
loud
and
well
might
he
protest
for
stacy
indiscreet
and
mirthful
tone
carried
far
it
carried
for
example
to
richard
minot
standing
hidden
behind
the
curtains
of
his
little
room
overhead
come
inside
martin
said
stacy
come
inside
and
have
a
bracer
you
sure
must
need
it
after
that
i
do
replied
wall
in
heartfelt
tones
he
rose
and
followed
tom
stacy
cheeks
burning
eyes
popping
minot
watched
them
disappear
into
the
manhattan
club
here
was
news
indeed
lord
harrowby
boon
companion
the
ablest
jewel
thief
in
america
just
what
did
that
mean
putting
on
coat
and
hat
he
hurried
to
the
hotel
office
and
there
wrote
a
cablegram
situation
suspicious
are
you
dead
certain
is
on
the
level
an
hour
later
in
his
london
office
jephson
read
this
message
carefully
three
times
chapter
vii
chain
lightning
collar
the
villa
jasmine
bruce
winter
home
stood
in
a
park
of
palms
and
shrubbery
some
two
blocks
from
the
hotel
de
la
pax
minot
walked
thither
that
evening
in
the
resplendent
company
of
jack
paddock
you
enjoy
bruce
paddock
confided
i
done
her
some
rather
good
lines
if
i
do
say
it
as
should
on
what
topics
asked
minot
with
a
smile
international
marriage
jewels
by
the
way
i
do
suppose
you
know
that
miss
cynthia
meyrick
is
to
appear
for
the
first
time
wearing
the
famous
harrowby
necklace
i
did
even
know
there
was
a
necklace
minot
returned
ah
such
ignorance
but
then
you
do
wander
much
in
feminine
society
do
you
bruce
told
me
about
it
this
morning
chain
lightning
collar
chain
lightning
what
ah
my
boy
paddock
lighted
a
cigarette
you
should
go
round
more
in
royal
circles
list
commoner
while
i
relate
it
seems
that
the
earl
of
raybrook
is
a
giddy
old
sport
with
a
gambling
streak
a
yard
wide
in
his
young
days
he
loved
the
lady
evelyn
hollowway
lady
evelyn
had
a
horse
entered
in
a
derby
about
that
time
name
chain
lightning
and
the
earl
of
raybrook
wagered
a
diamond
necklace
against
a
kiss
that
chain
lightning
would
lose
was
that
giving
big
odds
inquired
minot
not
if
you
believe
the
stories
of
lady
evelyn
beauty
well
it
happened
before
tammany
politicians
began
avenging
ireland
on
derby
day
chain
lightning
won
and
the
earl
came
across
with
the
necklace
afterward
he
married
lady
evelyn
to
get
back
the
necklace
cynic
and
being
a
rather
racy
old
boy
he
referred
to
the
necklace
thereafter
as
chain
lightning
collar
it
got
to
be
pretty
well
known
in
england
by
that
name
i
believe
it
is
considered
a
rather
neat
piece
of
jewelry
among
the
english
nobility
whose
sparklers
what
they
were
before
the
steel
business
in
pittsburgh
turned
out
a
good
thing
chain
lightning
collar
mused
minot
i
presume
lady
evelyn
was
the
mother
of
the
present
lord
harrowby
so
is
rumored
smiled
paddock
though
i
take
it
his
lordship
favors
his
father
in
looks
they
walked
along
for
a
moment
in
silence
the
story
of
this
necklace
of
diamonds
could
bring
but
one
thing
to
minot
thoughts
martin
wall
drooping
on
the
steps
of
the
manhattan
club
while
old
stacy
roared
with
joy
he
considered
should
he
tell
paddock
no
he
decided
he
would
wait
as
i
said
paddock
ran
on
you
enjoy
bruce
her
lines
are
good
but
somehow
it
really
a
great
problem
to
me
she
does
sound
human
and
natural
when
she
gets
them
off
i
looked
up
her
beauty
doctor
and
asked
him
if
he
could
put
a
witty
gleam
in
her
eye
but
he
told
me
he
did
care
to
go
that
far
in
correcting
bruce
maker
they
had
reached
the
villa
jasmine
now
a
great
white
palace
in
a
flowery
setting
more
like
a
dream
than
a
reality
the
evening
breeze
murmured
whisperingly
through
the
palms
a
hundred
gorgeous
colors
shone
in
the
moonlight
fountains
splashed
coolly
amid
the
greenery
act
two
muttered
minot
the
grounds
surrounding
the
castle
of
the
fairy
princess
you
have
to
come
down
here
do
you
replied
paddock
to
realize
that
old
mother
nature
has
a
little
on
belasco
after
all
the
whir
of
a
motor
behind
them
caused
the
two
young
men
to
turn
then
minot
saw
her
coming
up
the
path
toward
him
coming
up
that
fantastic
avenue
of
palms
tall
fair
white
a
lovely
figure
in
a
lovely
setting
ah
yes
lord
harrowby
he
walked
at
her
side
nonchalant
distinguished
almost
as
tall
as
a
popular
illustrator
thinks
a
man
in
evening
clothes
should
be
truly
they
made
a
handsome
couple
they
were
to
minot
himself
had
sworn
they
were
to
wed
he
kept
the
bitterness
from
his
tone
as
he
greeted
them
there
amid
the
soft
magic
of
the
florida
night
together
they
went
inside
in
the
center
of
a
magnificent
hallway
they
found
bruce
standing
like
stout
cortez
on
his
darien
peak
triumphant
amid
the
glory
of
her
gold
minot
thought
bruce
manner
of
greeting
somewhat
harried
and
oppressed
poor
lady
every
function
was
a
first
night
for
her
would
the
glare
of
the
footlights
frighten
her
would
she
falter
in
her
lines
forget
them
completely
only
her
sisters
of
the
stage
could
sympathize
with
her
understandingly
now
so
you
are
to
carry
cynthia
away
minot
heard
her
saying
to
lord
harrowby
such
a
lot
of
my
friends
have
married
into
the
peerage
indeed
i
have
sometimes
thought
you
english
have
no
other
pastime
save
that
of
slipping
engagement
rings
on
hands
across
the
sea
a
soft
voice
spoke
in
minot
ear
mine
paddock
was
saying
not
bad
eh
but
look
at
that
englishman
why
should
i
have
sat
up
all
last
night
writing
lines
to
try
on
him
can
you
tell
me
that
lord
harrowby
indeed
seemed
oblivious
of
bruce
little
bon
mot
he
hemmed
and
hawed
and
said
he
was
a
lucky
man
but
he
did
not
mean
that
he
was
a
lucky
man
because
he
had
the
privilege
of
hearing
bruce
bruce
slipped
out
of
the
shadows
into
the
weariness
of
another
formal
dinner
bruce
glittered
and
he
wrote
the
checks
he
was
a
scraggly
little
man
who
sometimes
sat
for
hours
at
a
time
in
silence
there
were
those
unkind
enough
to
say
that
he
sought
back
trying
to
recall
the
reason
that
had
led
him
to
marry
bruce
when
he
beheld
miss
cynthia
meyrick
and
knew
that
he
was
to
take
her
in
to
dinner
bruce
brightened
perceptibly
none
save
a
blind
and
deaf
man
could
have
failed
to
cocktails
consumed
the
party
turned
toward
the
except
for
the
meyricks
martin
wall
lord
harrowby
and
paddock
dick
minot
knew
none
of
them
there
were
a
couple
of
colorless
men
from
new
york
who
when
they
died
would
be
referred
to
as
prominent
club
men
a
horsy
girl
from
westchester
an
wife
and
daughter
a
number
of
names
from
boston
and
philadelphia
with
their
respective
bearers
and
last
but
not
least
the
two
bond
girls
from
omaha
blond
lovely
but
inclined
to
be
snobbish
even
in
that
company
for
their
mother
was
a
van
reypan
and
van
reypans
are
rare
birds
in
omaha
and
elsewhere
minot
took
in
the
elder
of
the
bond
girls
and
found
that
cynthia
meyrick
sat
on
his
left
he
glanced
at
her
throat
as
they
sat
down
it
was
bare
of
ornament
and
then
he
beheld
sparkling
in
her
lovely
hair
the
perfect
diamonds
of
chain
lightning
collar
as
he
turned
back
to
the
table
he
caught
the
eye
of
martin
wall
wall
eye
happened
to
be
coming
away
from
the
same
locality
the
girl
from
omaha
gossiped
of
plays
and
players
like
a
dramatic
page
from
some
old
sunday
newspaper
i
mad
about
the
stage
she
confided
of
course
we
get
all
the
best
shows
in
omaha
why
maxine
elliott
and
nat
goodwin
come
there
every
year
minot
new
yorker
shuddered
should
he
tell
her
of
the
many
and
active
years
in
the
lives
of
these
two
since
they
visited
any
town
together
no
what
use
on
the
other
side
of
him
a
sweet
voice
spoke
i
presume
you
know
minot
that
bruce
has
the
reputation
of
being
the
wittiest
hostess
in
san
marco
i
have
heard
as
much
minot
smiled
into
cynthia
meyrick
eyes
when
does
her
act
go
on
bruce
was
wondering
the
same
thing
she
knew
her
lines
she
was
ready
true
she
understood
few
of
those
lines
wit
was
not
her
specialty
until
paddock
took
charge
of
her
she
had
thought
colored
newspaper
supplements
humorous
in
the
extreme
however
the
lines
paddock
taught
her
seemed
to
go
well
and
she
continued
to
patronize
the
old
stand
she
looked
up
now
from
her
conversation
with
her
dinner
partner
and
silence
fell
as
at
a
curtain
ascending
i
was
just
saying
to
lord
harrowby
bruce
began
smiling
about
her
how
picturesque
our
business
streets
are
here
what
with
the
greek
merchants
in
their
native
costumes
bandits
every
one
of
them
growled
bruce
bravely
interrupting
his
wife
frowned
only
the
other
day
she
continued
i
bought
a
rug
from
a
man
who
claimed
to
be
a
persian
prince
he
said
it
was
a
and
i
think
it
must
have
been
for
ever
since
i
got
it
i
been
praying
genuine
a
little
ripple
of
amusement
ran
about
the
table
the
redoubtable
bruce
was
under
way
people
spoke
to
one
another
in
undertones
little
conversational
nudges
of
anticipation
by
the
way
cynthia
the
hostess
inquired
have
you
heard
from
helen
arden
lately
not
for
some
time
responded
miss
meyrick
although
i
have
her
promise
that
she
and
the
duke
will
be
here
next
tuesday
splendid
bruce
turned
to
his
lordship
i
think
of
helen
lord
harrowby
because
she
too
married
into
your
nobility
her
father
made
his
money
in
sausage
in
the
middle
west
in
his
youth
had
trouble
in
finding
a
pair
of
trousers
but
as
soon
as
the
money
began
to
roll
in
helen
started
to
look
him
up
a
coat
of
arms
and
a
family
motto
i
remember
suggesting
at
the
time
in
view
of
the
sausage
family
is
no
stronger
than
its
weakest
link
bruce
knew
when
to
pause
she
paused
now
the
ripple
became
an
outright
laugh
paddock
sipped
languorously
from
his
he
saw
that
his
lines
got
over
went
into
society
head
foremost
helen
did
bruce
continued
thought
herself
a
clever
amateur
actress
used
to
act
often
for
charity
though
i
do
recall
that
she
ever
got
it
the
beauty
of
bruce
wit
said
miss
meyrick
in
minot
ear
is
that
it
is
so
unconscious
she
does
appear
to
realize
when
she
has
said
a
good
thing
there
just
a
chance
that
she
does
realize
it
suggested
minot
then
helen
met
the
duke
of
lismore
bruce
was
speaking
once
more
perhaps
you
know
him
lord
harrowby
no
er
sorry
to
say
i
do
a
charming
chap
in
some
ways
helen
was
a
shavian
in
considering
marriage
the
chief
pursuit
of
women
she
pursued
followed
lismore
to
italy
where
he
proposed
i
presume
he
thought
that
being
in
rome
he
must
do
as
the
romeos
do
but
my
dear
lady
said
harrowby
in
a
daze
is
it
the
romans
is
what
the
romans
asked
bruce
blankly
your
lordship
is
correct
said
paddock
hastily
bruce
misquoted
purposely
in
jest
you
know
jibe
japery
oh
er
pardon
me
returned
his
lordship
i
saw
helen
in
london
last
spring
bruce
went
on
she
confided
to
me
that
she
considers
her
husband
a
genius
and
if
genius
really
be
nothing
but
an
infinite
capacity
for
taking
champagnes
i
am
sure
the
poor
child
is
right
little
murmurs
of
joy
and
the
dinner
proceeded
the
guests
bent
over
their
food
shipped
to
bruce
in
a
refrigerating
car
from
new
york
and
very
little
wearied
by
its
long
trip
here
and
there
two
talked
together
it
was
like
an
intermission
between
the
acts
minot
turned
to
the
omaha
girl
even
though
she
was
two
wives
behind
on
nat
goodwin
career
one
must
be
polite
it
was
at
the
close
of
the
dinner
that
bruce
scored
her
most
telling
point
she
and
lord
harrowby
were
conversing
about
a
famous
english
author
and
when
she
was
sure
she
had
the
attention
of
the
table
she
remarked
yes
we
met
his
wife
at
the
masonbys
but
i
have
always
felt
that
the
wife
of
a
celebrity
is
like
the
coupon
on
one
railway
ticket
how
that
mrs
bruce
minot
inquired
after
all
paddock
had
been
kind
to
him
not
good
if
detached
said
bruce
she
stood
her
guests
followed
suit
it
was
by
this
bon
mot
that
she
chose
to
have
her
dinner
live
in
the
gossip
of
san
marco
hence
with
it
she
closed
the
ceremony
witty
woman
your
wife
said
one
of
the
colorless
new
yorkers
to
bruce
when
the
men
were
left
alone
bruce
only
grunted
but
paddock
answered
brightly
do
you
really
think
so
yes
do
you
why
er
really
paddock
blushed
modest
author
he
a
servant
appeared
to
say
that
lord
harrowby
was
wanted
at
once
outside
and
excusing
himself
harrowby
departed
he
found
his
valet
a
plump
serious
man
waiting
in
the
shadows
on
the
veranda
for
a
time
they
talked
together
in
low
tones
when
harrowby
returned
to
the
his
never
cheerful
face
was
even
gloomier
than
usual
spencer
meyrick
and
bruce
exiles
both
of
them
talked
joyously
of
business
and
the
rush
of
the
day
work
for
which
both
longed
the
new
york
man
and
a
sapling
from
boston
conversed
of
chamber
music
martin
wall
sat
silent
contemplative
perhaps
had
he
spoken
his
thoughts
they
would
have
been
of
a
rich
jewel
shop
at
noon
deserted
a
later
bruce
was
scattered
among
the
palms
and
flowers
of
her
gorgeous
lawn
minot
had
fallen
again
to
the
elder
girl
from
omaha
and
blithely
for
her
he
was
displaying
his
broadway
ignorance
of
horticulture
suddenly
out
of
the
night
came
a
scream
instantly
when
he
heard
it
minot
knew
who
had
uttered
it
unceremoniously
he
parted
from
the
omaha
beauty
and
sped
over
the
lawn
but
quick
as
he
was
lord
harrowby
was
quicker
for
when
minot
came
up
he
saw
harrowby
bending
over
miss
meyrick
who
sat
upon
a
wicker
bench
cynthia
what
is
it
harrowby
was
saying
cynthia
meyrick
felt
wildly
of
her
shining
hair
your
necklace
she
gasped
chain
lightning
collar
he
took
it
he
took
it
who
i
do
know
a
man
a
man
reverent
repetition
by
feminine
voices
out
of
the
excited
group
he
leaped
out
at
me
there
by
that
tree
pinioned
my
arms
snatched
the
necklace
i
could
see
his
face
it
happened
in
the
shadow
no
matter
harrowby
replied
do
give
it
another
thought
my
child
but
how
can
i
help
i
shall
telephone
the
police
at
once
announced
spencer
meyrick
i
beg
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
expostulated
lord
harrowby
it
would
be
a
great
inconvenience
the
thing
was
worth
the
publicity
that
would
result
i
insist
that
the
police
be
kept
out
of
this
argument
loud
on
meyrick
part
ensued
suggestions
galore
were
offered
by
the
guests
but
in
the
end
lord
harrowby
had
his
way
it
was
agreed
not
to
call
in
the
police
minot
looking
up
saw
a
sneering
smile
on
the
face
of
martin
wall
in
a
flash
he
knew
the
truth
with
aunt
mary
calling
loudly
for
smelling
salts
and
the
whole
party
more
or
less
in
confusion
the
return
to
the
house
started
paddock
walked
at
minot
side
rather
looks
as
though
chain
lightning
collar
had
choked
off
our
gaiety
he
mumbled
serves
her
right
for
wearing
the
thing
in
her
hair
she
spoiled
two
corking
lines
for
me
by
not
wearing
it
where
you
naturally
expect
a
necklace
to
be
worn
minot
maneuvered
so
as
to
intercept
lord
harrowby
under
the
portico
may
i
speak
with
you
a
moment
he
inquired
harrowby
bowed
and
they
stepped
into
the
shadows
of
the
drive
lord
harrowby
said
minot
trying
to
keep
the
excitement
from
his
voice
i
have
certain
information
about
one
of
the
guests
here
this
evening
that
i
believe
would
interest
you
your
lordship
has
been
badly
buffaloed
one
of
our
fellow
diners
at
bruce
table
holds
the
title
of
the
ablest
jewel
thief
in
america
he
watched
keenly
to
catch
lord
harrowby
start
of
surprise
alas
he
caught
nothing
of
the
sort
nonsense
said
his
lordship
nonchalantly
you
must
let
your
imagination
carry
you
away
dear
chap
imagination
nothing
i
know
what
i
talking
about
and
then
minot
added
sarcastically
sorry
to
bore
you
with
this
his
lordship
laughed
old
fellow
i
not
interested
but
have
you
just
lost
a
diamond
necklace
yes
they
had
reached
a
particularly
dark
and
secluded
spot
beneath
the
canopy
of
palm
leaves
harrowby
turned
suddenly
and
put
his
hands
on
minot
shoulders
minot
he
said
you
are
here
to
see
that
nothing
interferes
with
my
marriage
to
miss
meyrick
i
trust
you
are
determined
to
do
your
duty
to
your
employers
absolutely
that
is
why
then
replied
harrowby
quickly
i
am
going
to
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
this
for
me
suddenly
minot
felt
something
cold
and
glassy
in
his
hand
startled
he
looked
down
even
in
the
dark
chain
lightning
collar
sparkled
like
the
famous
toy
that
it
was
your
lordship
i
can
not
explain
now
i
can
only
tell
you
it
is
quite
necessary
that
you
help
me
at
this
time
if
you
wish
to
do
your
full
duty
by
mr
jephson
who
took
this
necklace
from
miss
meyrick
hair
asked
minot
hotly
i
did
i
assure
you
it
was
the
only
way
to
prevent
our
plans
from
going
awry
please
keep
it
until
i
ask
you
for
it
and
turning
lord
harrowby
walked
rapidly
toward
the
house
the
brute
angrily
minot
stood
turning
the
necklace
over
in
his
hand
so
he
frightened
the
girl
he
is
to
marry
the
girl
he
is
supposed
to
love
what
should
he
do
go
to
her
and
tell
her
of
harrowby
amiable
eccentricities
he
could
hardly
do
that
harrowby
had
taken
him
into
his
confidence
and
besides
there
was
jephson
of
the
great
bald
head
the
peter
pan
eyes
nothing
to
do
but
wait
returning
to
the
hotel
from
bruce
villa
he
found
awaiting
him
a
cable
from
jephson
the
cable
assured
him
that
beyond
any
question
the
man
in
san
marco
was
allan
harrowby
and
like
cæsar
wife
above
suspicion
yet
even
as
he
read
lord
harrowby
walked
through
the
lobby
and
at
his
side
was
james
house
detective
of
the
hotel
de
la
pax
they
came
from
the
manager
office
where
they
had
evidently
been
closeted
with
the
cablegram
in
his
hand
minot
entered
the
elevator
and
ascended
to
his
room
the
other
hand
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
top
coat
closed
tightly
upon
chain
lightning
collar
the
bauble
that
the
earl
of
raybrook
had
once
wagered
against
a
kiss
chapter
viii
after
the
trained
seals
minot
opened
his
eyes
on
thursday
morning
with
the
uncomfortable
feeling
that
he
was
far
from
his
beloved
new
york
for
a
moment
he
lay
dazed
wandering
in
that
dim
borderland
between
sleep
and
waking
then
suddenly
he
remembered
oh
yes
by
jove
he
muttered
i
been
knighted
groom
of
the
scandals
and
keeper
of
the
royal
jewels
that
me
he
lifted
his
pillow
there
on
the
white
sheet
sparkled
the
necklace
of
which
the
whole
british
nobility
was
proud
chain
collar
some
diamonds
perfectly
graduated
his
for
the
moment
what
harrowby
up
to
i
wonder
he
reflected
the
dear
old
top
nice
pleasant
little
party
if
a
policeman
should
find
this
in
my
pocket
another
perfect
day
shone
in
that
narrow
spanish
street
up
in
manhattan
theatrical
press
agents
were
crowning
huge
piles
of
snow
with
posters
announcing
their
attractions
ferries
were
held
up
by
ice
in
the
river
a
breeze
from
the
arctic
swept
round
the
flatiron
building
here
lazy
summer
lolled
on
the
bosom
of
the
town
in
the
hotel
minot
encountered
jack
paddock
superb
in
white
flannels
above
his
grapefruit
he
accepted
paddock
invitation
to
join
him
by
the
way
said
bruce
jester
holding
up
a
small
badly
printed
newspaper
have
you
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
marco
yet
no
what
that
a
morning
newspaper
by
courtesy
started
here
a
few
weeks
back
by
a
noiseless
little
spaniard
from
havana
named
manuel
gonzale
slipped
in
here
on
his
rubber
soles
gonzale
did
dressed
all
in
white
lovely
lemon
face
shifty
eyes
and
his
newspaper
hot
stuff
my
boy
it
has
town
topics
looking
like
a
consular
report
from
greenland
scandals
asked
minot
also
attacking
a
grapefruit
scandals
and
rumors
of
scandals
mostly
hints
you
know
several
references
this
morning
to
our
proud
and
haughty
friend
lord
harrowby
for
example
madame
on
dit
writing
in
her
column
on
page
one
has
this
to
say
impecunious
but
titled
englishman
who
has
arrived
in
our
midst
recently
with
the
idea
of
connecting
with
certain
american
dollars
has
an
interesting
time
ahead
of
him
if
rumor
speaks
true
the
little
incident
in
the
lobby
of
a
local
hotel
the
other
evening
which
was
duly
reported
in
this
column
at
the
time
was
but
a
mild
beginning
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
the
claimant
to
the
title
held
so
jealously
by
our
british
friend
promises
immediate
developments
which
will
be
rich
rare
and
racy
rich
rare
and
racy
repeated
minot
thoughtfully
ah
yes
we
were
to
watch
mr
trimmer
i
had
almost
forgot
him
in
the
excitement
of
last
evening
by
the
way
does
the
know
anything
about
the
disappearance
of
chain
lightning
collar
not
as
yet
smiled
paddock
although
madame
on
dit
claims
to
have
been
a
guest
at
the
dinner
by
the
way
what
do
you
make
of
last
night
melodramatic
farce
i
do
know
what
to
make
of
it
answered
minot
truthfully
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
the
necklace
in
his
inside
coat
pocket
then
all
i
can
say
my
dear
watson
replied
paddock
with
burlesque
seriousness
is
that
you
are

in
my
powers
of

me
a
cigarette
and
i
tell
you
the
name
of
the

is
gloating
over
those
diamonds

ahead
paddock
reaching
for
a
match
tray
spoke
in
a
low
tone
in
ear
martin
wall
he
said
he
leaned
back
you
ask
how
i
arrived
at
my
conclusion
simple
enough
i
went
through
the
list
of
guests
for
possible
crooks
and
eliminated
them
one
by
one
the
man
i
have
mentioned
alone
was
left
ever
notice
his
eyes
remind
me
of
manuel
gonzale
he
too
polished
too
slick
too
good
to
be
true
traveled
too
much
nobody
travels
as
much
as
he
has
except
for
the
very
good
reason
that
a
detective
is
on
the
trail
and
he
made
friends
with
simple
old
harrowby
on
an
atlantic
liner
that
if
you
read
popular
fiction
is
alone
enough
to
condemn
him
believe
me
dick
martin
wall
should
be
watched
all
right
laughed
minot
you
watch
him
i
a
notion
to
harrowby
makes
me
weary
wo
call
in
a
solitary
detective
any
one
might
think
he
does
want
the
necklace
back
after
breakfast
minot
and
paddock
played
five
sets
of
tennis
on
the
hotel
courts
and
minot
won
despite
the
harrowby
diamonds
in
his
trousers
pocket
weighing
him
down
luncheon
over
paddock
suggested
a
drive
to
tarragona
island
a
little
bit
of
nowhere
a
mile
he
said
no
man
can
ever
know
the
true
inwardness
of
the
word
lonesome
until
he
seen
tarragona
minot
hesitated
ought
he
to
leave
the
scene
of
action
of
action
he
glanced
about
him
there
was
less
action
here
than
in
a
henry
james
novel
the
tangle
of
events
in
which
he
was
involved
rested
for
a
siesta
so
he
and
paddock
drove
along
the
narrow
neck
of
land
that
led
from
the
mainland
to
tarragona
island
they
entered
the
kingdom
of
the
lonely
sandy
beach
with
the
ocean
on
one
side
swamps
on
the
other
scrubby
palms
disreputable
foliage
here
and
there
a
cluster
of
seemingly
deserted
cottages
the
world
and
its
works
apparently
a
million
miles
away
yet
out
on
one
corner
of
that
bleak
forgotten
acre
stood
the
slim
outline
of
a
wireless
and
in
a
little
white
house
lived
a
man
who
amid
the
and
the
talked
daily
with
great
ships
and
cities
far
away
i
told
you
it
was
lonesome
said
paddock
lonesome
shivered
minot
even
god
has
forgot
this
place
only
marconi
has
remembered
and
even
as
they
wandered
there
amid
the
swamps
where
alligators
and
rattlesnakes
alone
saw
fit
to
dwell
back
in
san
marco
the
capable
mr
trimmer
was
busy
by
poster
and
by
he
was
spreading
word
of
his
newest
coup
so
that
by
evening
no
one
in
town
save
the
few
who
were
most
concerned
was
unaware
of
a
development
rich
rare
and
racy
minot
and
paddock
returned
late
and
their
dinner
was
correspondingly
delayed
it
was
when
they
at
last
strolled
into
the
lobby
of
the
de
la
pax
there
they
encountered
miss
meyrick
her
father
and
lord
harrowby
we
taking
harrowby
to
the
movies
said
miss
meyrick
he
confesses
he
never
been
wo
you
come
along
she
was
one
of
her
gay
selves
white
slim
laughing
irresistible
minot
looking
at
her
thought
that
she
could
make
even
tarragona
island
bearable
he
knew
of
no
greater
tribute
to
her
charm
the
girl
and
harrowby
led
the
way
and
minot
and
paddock
followed
with
spencer
meyrick
the
old
man
was
an
imposing
figure
in
his
white
serge
which
accentuated
the
floridness
of
his
face
he
talked
of
an
administration
that
did
not
please
him
of
a
railroad
fallen
on
evil
days
now
and
again
he
paused
and
seemed
to
lose
the
thread
of
what
he
was
saying
while
his
eyes
dwelt
on
his
daughter
walking
ahead
they
arrived
shortly
at
the
san
marco
devoted
each
evening
to
three
acts
of
refined
vaudeville
and
six
of
the
newest
film
releases
it
was
here
that
the
rich
loitering
in
san
marco
found
their
only
theatrical
amusement
and
forgetting
broadway
laughed
and
were
thrilled
with
simpler
folk
a
large
crowd
was
fairly
fighting
to
get
in
and
paddock
who
volunteered
to
buy
the
tickets
was
forced
to
take
his
place
at
the
end
of
a
long
line
finally
they
reached
the
dim
interior
of
the
and
were
shown
to
seats
far
down
in
front
by
hanging
back
in
the
dusk
minot
managed
to
secure
the
end
seat
with
miss
meyrick
at
his
side
beyond
her
sat
lord
harrowby
gazing
with
rapt
british
seriousness
at
the
humorous
film
that
was
being
flashed
on
the
screen
between
pictures
harrowby
offered
an
opinion
you
in
america
are
a
jolly
lot
he
said
just
fancy
our
best
people
in
england
attending
a
cinematograph
exhibition
they
tried
to
fancy
it
but
with
his
lordship
there
they
could
two
more
pictures
ran
their
filmy
lengths
while
minot
sat
entranced
there
in
the
half
dark
it
was
not
the
pictures
that
entranced
him
rather
was
it
a
lady
nearness
the
flash
of
her
smile
the
hundred
and
one
tones
of
her
voice
all
all
again
as
it
had
been
in
that
ridiculous
automobile
just
before
the
awakening
after
the
third
picture
the
lights
of
the
auditorium
were
turned
up
and
the
hour
of
vaudeville
arrived
on
to
the
stage
strolled
a
pert
confident
youth
garbed
in
shabby
grandeur
who
attempted
sidewalk
repartee
he
clipped
his
jests
from
periodicals
bought
his
songs
from
an
song
writer
and
would
have
gone
to
the
mat
with
any
one
who
denied
that
his
act
was
refined
minot
listening
to
his
gibes
thought
of
the
paddock
jest
factory
and
bruce
when
the
young
man
had
wrung
the
last
encore
from
a
kindly
audience
the
was
raised
and
revealed
on
the
stage
in
gleaming
splendor
captain
ponsonby
troupe
of
trained
seals
an
intelligent
aggregation
they
proved
balancing
balls
on
their
small
heads
juggling
flaming
torches
and
taking
as
their
just
due
lumps
of
sugar
from
the
captain
hand
as
they
finished
each
feat
the
audience
recalled
them
again
and
again
and
even
the
peerage
was
captivated
clever
beasts
are
they
lord
harrowby
remarked
and
as
captain
ponsonby
took
his
final
curtain
his
lordship
added
er
what
follows
the
trained
seals
the
answer
to
harrowby
query
came
almost
immediately
and
a
startling
answer
it
proved
to
be
into
the
glare
of
the
footlights
stepped
henry
trimmer
his
manner
was
that
of
the
conquering
hero
for
a
moment
he
stood
smiling
and
bowing
before
the
approving
multitude
then
he
raised
a
hand
commanding
silence
my
dear
friends
he
said
i
appreciate
this
reception
as
i
said
in
my
handbill
of
this
afternoon
i
am
working
in
the
interests
of
justice
the
gentleman
who
accompanies
me
to
your
delightful
little
city
is
beyond
any
question
whatsoever
george
harrowby
the
eldest
son
of
the
earl
of
raybrook
and
as
such
he
is
entitled
to
call
himself
lord
harrowby
i
know
the
american
people
well
enough
to
feel
sure
that
when
they
realize
the
facts
they
will
demand
that
justice
be
done
that
is
why
i
have
prevailed
upon
lord
harrowby
to
meet
you
here
in
this
your
temple
of
amusement
and
put
his
case
before
you
his
lordship
will
talk
to
you
for
a
time
with
a
view
to
getting
acquainted
he
has
chosen
for
the
subject
of
his
discourse
the
old
days
at
rakedale
hall
ladies
and
gentlemen
i
have
the
honor
to
introduce
the
real
lord
harrowby
out
of
the
wings
shuffled
the
lean
and
gloomy
englishman
whom
mr
trimmer
had
snatched
from
the
unknown
to
cloud
a
certain
the
applause
burst
forth
it
shook
the
building
from
the
gallery
descended
a
shrill
penetrating
whistle
of
acclaim
minot
glanced
at
the
face
of
the
girl
beside
him
she
was
looking
straight
ahead
her
cheeks
bright
red
her
eyes
flashing
with
anger
beyond
the
face
of
harrowby
loomed
frozen
terrible
shall
we
go
minot
whispered
by
no
means
the
girl
answered
we
should
only
call
attention
to
our
presence
here
i
know
at
least
fifty
people
in
this
audience
we
must
see
it
through
the
applause
was
stilled
at
last
and
supremely
fussed
the
real
lord
harrowby
faced
that
friendly
throng
dear
er
people
he
said
as
mr
trimmer
has
told
you
we
seek
only
justice
i
am
not
here
to
argue
my
right
to
the
title
i
claim
that
i
can
do
at
the
proper
time
and
place
i
am
simply
proposing
to
go
back
back
into
the
past
many
years
back
to
the
days
when
i
was
a
boy
at
rakedale
hall
i
shall
picture
those
days
as
no
impostor
could
picture
them
and
when
i
have
done
i
shall
allow
you
to
judge
and
there
in
that
crowded
little
southern
on
that
hot
february
night
the
actor
who
followed
the
trained
seals
proceeded
to
go
back
with
unfaltering
touch
he
sketched
for
his
audience
the
great
stone
country
seat
called
rakedale
hall
where
for
centuries
the
harrowbys
had
dwelt
it
was
as
though
he
took
his
audience
there
to
visit
through
the
massive
iron
gates
up
the
broad
avenue
bordered
with
limes
until
the
high
chimneys
the
pointed
gables
the
mullioned
windows
and
the
walls
half
hidden
by
ivy
creeping
roses
and
honeysuckles
were
revealed
to
them
he
took
them
through
the
house
to
the
servants
quarters
which
he
called
the
offices
out
into
the
kitchen
gardens
thence
to
the
paved
quadrangle
of
the
stables
with
its
arched
gateway
and
the
chiming
clock
above
conservatories
they
visited
breathlessly
they
saw
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
the
low
square
tower
of
the
old
church
and
the
chimneys
of
the
vicar
modest
house
and
far
away
they
beheld
the
trees
that
furnished
cover
to
the
little
beasts
it
was
the
earl
of
raybrook
pleasure
to
hunt
in
the
season
becoming
more
specific
he
spoke
of
the
neighbors
and
a
bit
of
romance
crept
in
in
the
person
of
the
honorable
edith
townshend
who
lived
to
the
west
of
rakedale
hall
he
described
at
length
the
picturesque
personality
of
the
racing
parson
neighbor
on
the
south
and
in
full
accord
with
the
ideas
of
the
sporting
earl
of
raybrook
the
events
of
his
youth
he
said
crowded
back
upon
him
as
he
recalled
this
happy
scene
and
emotion
choked
him
however
he
managed
to
tell
of
a
few
of
the
celebrities
who
came
to
dinner
of
their
bon
mots
their
preferences
in
cuisine
he
mentioned
the
thrilling
morning
when
he
was
nearly
drowned
in
the
brook
that
skirted
the
purple
meadow
also
the
thrilling
afternoon
when
he
hid
his
mother
famous
necklace
in
the
biscuit
box
on
the
sideboard
and
upset
a
whole
household
and
he
narrated
a
dozen
similar
exploits
each
garnished
with
small
illuminating
details
his
audience
sat
fascinated
all
who
listened
felt
that
his
words
rang
true
even
lord
harrowby
himself
sitting
far
forward
his
hand
gripping
the
seat
in
front
of
him
until
the
white
of
his
knuckles
showed
through
next
the
speaker
shifted
his
scene
to
eton
thrilled
his
hearers
with
the
story
of
his
revolt
against
oxford
of
his
flight
to
the
states
his
wild
days
in
arizona
and
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
a
letter
written
by
the
old
earl
of
raybrook
himself
profanely
expostulating
with
him
for
his
madness
and
begging
that
he
return
to
ascend
to
the
earldom
when
the
old
man
was
no
more
the
real
lord
harrowby
finished
reading
this
somewhat
pathetic
appeal
with
a
little
break
in
his
voice
and
stood
looking
out
at
the
audience
if
my
brother
allan
himself
were
in
the
house
he
said
he
would
have
to
admit
that
it
is
our
father
speaking
in
that
letter
a
rustle
of
interest
ran
through
the
auditorium
the
few
who
had
recognized
harrowby
turned
to
stare
at
him
now
for
a
moment
he
sat
silent
his
face
a
variety
of
colors
in
the
dim
light
then
with
a
cry
of
rage
he
leaped
to
his
feet
you
stole
that
letter
you
cur
he
cried
you
are
a
liar
a
fraud
an
impostor
the
man
on
the
stage
stood
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
ah
allan
he
answered
so
you
are
here
after
all
is
that
quite
the
proper
greeting
after
all
these
years
a
roar
of
sympathetic
applause
greeted
this
sally
there
was
no
doubt
as
to
whose
side
mr
trimmer
friend
the
public
was
on
harrowby
stood
in
his
place
his
lips
twitching
his
eyes
for
once
blazing
and
angry
dick
minot
was
by
this
time
escorting
miss
meyrick
up
the
aisle
and
they
came
quickly
to
the
cool
street
harrowby
paddock
and
spencer
meyrick
followed
immediately
his
lordship
was
most
contrite
a
thousand
pardons
he
pleaded
really
i
ca
tell
you
how
sorry
i
am
cynthia
to
have
made
you
conspicuous
what
was
i
thinking
of
but
he
maddened
me
i
do
worry
allan
said
miss
meyrick
gently
i
like
you
the
better
for
being
maddened
old
spencer
meyrick
said
nothing
but
minot
noted
that
his
face
was
rather
red
and
his
eyes
were
somewhat
dangerous
they
all
walked
back
to
the
hotel
in
silence
from
the
hotel
lobby
as
if
by
prearrangement
harrowby
followed
miss
meyrick
and
her
father
into
a
parlor
minot
and
paddock
were
left
alone
my
word
old
top
said
paddock
facetiously
a
rough
night
for
the
nobility
what
do
you
think
that
lad
story
sounded
like
a
little
bit
of
all
right
to
me
eh
what
it
did
sound
convincing
returned
the
troubled
minot
but
then
a
servant
at
rakedale
hall
could
have
concocted
it
mayhap
said
paddock
however
old
spencer
meyrick
looked
to
me
like
a
volcano
i
want
to
get
out
from
under
poor
old
harrowby
afraid
there
a
rift
within
the
loot
nay
no
loot
at
all
jack
said
minot
firmly
that
wedding
has
got
to
take
place
why
what
it
to
you
it
happens
to
be
everything
but
keep
it
under
your
hat
great
scott
does
harrowby
owe
you
money
i
ca
explain
just
at
present
jack
oh
very
well
replied
paddock
but
take
it
from
me
old
man
she
a
million
times
too
good
for
him
a
million
laughed
minot
bitterly
you
underestimate
paddock
stood
staring
with
wonder
at
his
friend
you
lisp
in
riddles
my
boy
he
said
do
i
returned
minot
maybe
some
day
i
make
it
all
clear
he
parted
from
paddock
and
ascended
to
the
third
floor
as
he
wandered
through
the
dark
passageways
in
search
of
his
room
he
bumped
suddenly
into
a
heavy
man
walking
softly
something
about
the
contour
of
the
man
in
the
dark
gave
him
a
suggestion
good
evening
wall
he
said
the
scurry
of
hurrying
footsteps
but
no
answer
minot
went
on
to
and
placed
his
key
in
the
lock
it
would
not
turn
he
twisted
the
knob
of
the
door
it
was
unlocked
he
stepped
inside
and
flashed
on
the
light
his
small
abode
was
in
a
mad
disorder
the
chiffonier
drawers
had
been
emptied
on
the
floor
the
bed
was
torn
to
pieces
the
rug
thrown
in
a
corner
minot
smiled
to
himself
some
one
had
been
searching
searching
for
chain
lightning
collar
who
who
but
the
man
he
had
bumped
against
in
that
dark
passageway
chapter
ix
wanted
board
and
room
as
dick
minot
bent
over
to
pick
up
his
scattered
property
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
and
lord
harrowby
drooped
in
the
nobleman
was
gloom
personified
he
threw
himself
despondently
down
on
the
bed
minot
old
chap
he
drawled
it
all
over
his
eyes
took
in
the
wreckage
eh
what
the
deuce
have
you
been
doing
old
boy
i
have
been
doing
anything
minot
answered
but
others
have
been
busy
while
we
were
at
the
er
theater
fond
fingers
have
been
searching
for
chain
lightning
collar
the
devil
you
have
lost
it
no
not
yet
i
believe
minot
took
the
envelope
from
his
pocket
and
drew
out
the
gleaming
necklace
ah
it
still
safe
harrowby
leaped
from
the
bed
and
slammed
shut
the
door
dear
old
boy
he
cried
keep
the
accursed
thing
in
your
pocket
no
one
must
see
it
i
say
who
been
searching
here
do
you
think
it
could
have
been
what
is
interest
in
your
necklace
some
other
time
please
sorry
to
inconvenience
you
with
the
thing
do
hang
on
to
it
wo
you
awful
if
you
did
bad
as
it
is
as
i
said
when
i
came
in
it
all
over
what
all
over
everything
the
marriage
my
chance
for
happiness
minot
i
a
most
unlucky
chap
meyrick
has
just
postponed
the
wedding
in
a
frightfully
loud
tone
of
voice
postponed
it
sad
news
for
jephson
this
yet
as
he
spoke
minot
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
in
his
heart
he
smiled
the
pleasantest
smile
he
had
so
far
shown
san
marco
exactly
he
was
fearfully
rattled
was
meyrick
my
word
how
he
did
go
on
considers
his
daughter
humiliated
by
the
antics
of
that
creature
we
saw
on
the
stage
ca
say
i
blame
him
either
the
wedding
is
indefinitely
postponed
unless
that
impostor
is
removed
from
the
scene
immediately
oh
unless
said
minot
his
heart
sank
his
smile
vanished
unless
was
the
word
i
fancy
said
harrowby
blinking
wisely
lord
harrowby
minot
began
you
intimated
the
other
day
that
this
man
might
really
be
your
brother
no
harrowby
broke
in
impossible
i
got
a
good
look
at
the
chap
he
no
more
a
harrowby
than
you
are
you
give
me
your
word
for
that
absolutely
even
after
twenty
years
of
america
no
harrowby
would
drag
his
father
name
on
to
the
vaudeville
stage
no
he
is
an
impostor
and
as
such
he
deserves
no
consideration
whatever
and
by
the
by
minot
you
will
note
that
the
postponement
is
through
no
fault
of
mine
minot
made
a
wry
face
i
have
noted
it
he
said
in
other
words
i
go
on
to
the
stage
now
following
the
man
who
followed
the
trained
seals
i
thought
my
role
was
that
of
cupid
but
it
begins
to
look
more
like
captain
kidd
ah
well
i
do
my
best
he
stood
up
i
going
out
into
the
soft
moonlight
for
a
little
while
lord
harrowby
while
i
gone
you
might
call
spencer
meyrick
up
and
ask
him
to
do
nothing
definite
in
the
way
of
postponement
until
he
hears
from
me
us
er
you
splendid
of
you
really
said
harrowby
enthusiastically
as
minot
held
open
the
door
for
him
i
had
the
feeling
i
could
fall
back
on
you
and
i
have
the
feeling
that
you
fallen
smiled
minot
so
long
better
wait
up
for
my
report
fifteen
minutes
later
seated
in
a
small
rowboat
on
the
starry
waters
of
the
harbor
minot
was
loudly
saluting
the
yacht
finally
martin
wall
appeared
at
the
rail
well
what
want
he
demanded
a
word
with
you
wall
minot
answered
will
you
be
good
enough
to
let
down
your
accommodation
ladder
for
a
moment
wall
hesitated
and
minot
watching
him
knew
why
he
hesitated
he
suspected
that
the
young
man
in
the
tiny
boat
there
on
the
calm
bright
waters
had
come
to
repay
a
call
earlier
in
the
evening
a
call
made
while
the
host
was
out
at
last
he
decided
to
let
down
the
ladder
glad
to
see
you
he
announced
genially
as
minot
came
on
deck
awfully
nice
of
you
to
say
that
minot
laughed
reassures
me
because
i
heard
there
are
sharks
in
these
waters
they
sat
down
in
wicker
chairs
on
the
forward
deck
minot
stared
at
the
cluster
of
lights
that
was
san
marco
by
night
corking
view
you
have
of
that
town
he
commented
ah
yes
wall
queer
eyes
narrowed
did
you
row
out
here
to
tell
me
that
he
inquired
a
deserved
rebuke
minot
returned
time
flies
and
my
errand
is
a
pressing
one
am
i
right
in
assuming
wall
that
you
are
lord
harrowby
friend
i
am
good
then
you
will
want
to
help
him
in
the
very
serious
difficulty
in
which
he
now
finds
himself
wall
the
man
who
calls
himself
the
real
lord
harrowby
made
his
debut
on
a
vaudeville
stage
so
i
heard
said
wall
with
a
short
laugh
lord
harrowby
fiancée
and
her
father
are
greatly
disturbed
they
insist
that
this
impostor
must
be
removed
from
the
scene
at
once
or
there
will
be
no
wedding
wall
it
is
up
to
you
and
me
to
remove
him
just
what
is
your
interest
in
the
matter
wall
inquired
the
same
as
yours
i
am
harrowby
friend
now
wall
this
is
the
situation
as
i
see
it
wanted
board
and
room
in
a
quiet
neighborhood
for
george
harrowby
far
from
the
the
vaudeville
stage
the
wedding
march
and
other
disturbing
elements
and
what
is
more
i
think
i
found
the
quiet
neighborhood
i
think
right
here
aboard
the
oh
indeed
yes
a
simple
affair
to
arrange
wall
trimmer
and
his
live
proposition
are
just
about
due
for
their
final
appearance
of
the
night
at
the
right
now
i
will
call
at
the
stage
door
and
lead
mr
trimmer
away
after
his
little
introductory
speech
i
will
keep
him
away
until
you
and
a
couple
of
your
sailors
i
suggest
the
two
i
met
so
informally
in
the
north
river
have
met
the
vaudeville
lord
at
the
stage
door
and
gently
but
firmly
persuaded
him
to
come
aboard
this
boat
wall
regarded
minot
with
a
cynical
smile
a
clever
scheme
he
said
what
would
you
say
was
the
penalty
for
kidnaping
in
this
state
oh
why
look
it
up
asked
minot
carelessly
surely
martin
wall
is
not
afraid
of
a
backwoods
constable
what
do
you
mean
by
that
my
boy
said
wall
with
an
ugly
stare
what
do
you
think
i
mean
minot
smiled
back
i
be
very
glad
to
take
the
role
i
assigned
you
i
ca
help
feeling
that
it
will
be
more
entertaining
than
the
one
i
have
the
difficulty
in
the
way
is
trimmer
i
believe
i
am
better
fitted
to
engage
his
attention
i
know
him
better
than
you
do
and
he
trusts
me
begging
your
pardon
further
he
did
give
me
a
nasty
dig
said
wall
flaming
at
the
recollection
the
noisy
mountebank
well
my
boy
your
young
enthusiasm
has
won
me
i
do
what
i
can
and
you
can
do
a
lot
watch
me
until
you
see
me
lead
trimmer
away
then
get
his
pet
i
steer
trimmer
somewhere
near
the
beach
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
when
you
get
george
safely
aboard
wave
a
red
light
in
the
bow
then
trimmer
and
i
shall
part
company
for
the
night
i
on
said
wall
rising
anything
to
help
harrowby
and
this
wo
be
the
first
time
i
waited
at
the
stage
door
said
minot
but
do
stop
to
buy
a
champagne
supper
for
a
trained
seal
will
you
i
do
want
to
have
to
listen
to
mr
trimmer
all
night
they
rowed
ashore
in
company
with
two
husky
members
of
the
crew
and
ten
minutes
later
minot
was
walking
with
the
pompous
mr
trimmer
through
the
quiet
plaza
he
had
told
that
gentleman
that
he
came
from
allan
harrowby
to
talk
terms
and
trimmer
was
puffed
with
pride
accordingly
so
harrowby
has
come
to
his
senses
at
last
he
said
well
i
thought
this
vaudeville
business
would
bring
him
round
although
i
must
say
i
a
bit
disappointed
down
in
my
heart
my
publicity
campaign
has
hardly
started
i
had
so
many
lovely
little
plans
for
the
future
say
it
makes
me
sad
to
win
so
soon
sorry
laughed
minot
lord
harrowby
however
deems
it
best
to
call
a
halt
he
suggests
pardon
me
interrupted
mr
trimmer
grandiloquently
as
the
victor
in
the
contest
i
shall
do
any
suggesting
that
is
done
and
what
i
suggest
is
this
morning
i
shall
call
upon
allan
harrowby
at
his
hotel
i
shall
bring
george
with
me
also
some
newspaper
friends
of
mine
in
front
of
the
crowd
allan
harrowby
must
acknowledge
his
brother
as
the
future
heir
to
the
earldom
of
raybrook
why
the
newspaper
men
minot
inquired
publicity
said
trimmer
it
the
breath
of
life
to
me
my
business
my
first
love
my
last
frankly
i
want
all
the
advertisement
out
of
this
thing
i
can
get
at
what
hour
shall
we
call
you
would
not
consider
a
delay
of
a
few
days
minot
asked
save
your
breath
advised
trimmer
promptly
ah
i
feared
it
laughed
minot
well
then
shall
we
say
eleven
you
are
to
call
with
george
harrowby
eleven
it
is
said
trimmer
they
had
reached
a
little
park
by
the
harbor
edge
trimmer
looked
at
his
watch
and
that
being
all
settled
i
run
back
to
the
theater
i
myself
have
advised
harrowby
to
surrender
minot
began
wise
boy
good
night
said
trimmer
moving
away
not
that
i
have
been
particularly
impressed
by
your
standing
as
a
publicity
man
continued
minot
mr
trimmer
stopped
in
his
tracks
as
a
matter
of
fact
went
on
minot
i
never
heard
of
you
or
any
of
the
things
you
claim
to
have
advertised
until
i
came
to
san
marco
mr
trimmer
came
slowly
back
up
the
grave
walk
in
just
what
inland
hamlet
untouched
by
telegraph
telephone
newspaper
and
railroad
he
asked
have
you
been
living
minot
dropped
to
a
handy
bench
and
smiled
up
into
mr
trimmer
thin
face
new
york
city
he
replied
mr
trimmer
glanced
back
at
the
lights
of
san
marco
hesitatingly
then
it
was
really
a
cruel
temptation
he
sat
down
beside
minot
on
the
bench
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
he
inquired
that
you
lived
in
new
york
two
years
ago
and
did
hear
of
cotrell
ink
eraser
such
was
my
unhappy
fate
smiled
minot
then
you
were
in
ludlow
street
jail
that
all
i
got
to
say
trimmer
replied
why
man
what
i
did
for
that
eraser
is
famous
i
rigged
up
a
big
electric
sign
in
times
square
and
all
night
long
i
had
an
electric
cotrell
erasing
indiscreet
sentences
the
kind
of
things
people
write
when
they
get
foolish
with
their
fountain
pens
for
instance
hereby
deed
to
tottie
footlights
all
my
real
and
personal
property
and
the
like
it
took
the
town
by
storm
theatrical
managers
complained
that
people
preferred
to
stand
and
look
at
my
sign
rather
than
visit
the
shows
can
you
look
me
in
the
eye
and
say
that
you
never
saw
that
sign
well
minot
answered
i
begin
to
remember
a
little
about
it
now
of
course
you
do
mr
trimmer
gave
him
a
congratulatory
slap
on
the
knee
and
if
you
think
hard
probably
you
can
recall
my
neat
little
stunt
of
the
prima
donna
and
the
cough
drops
i
want
to
tell
you
about
that
he
spoke
with
fervor
the
story
of
his
brave
deeds
rose
high
to
shatter
the
stars
apart
a
passed
while
his
picturesque
reminiscences
flowed
on
minot
sat
enraptured
his
eyes
on
the
harbor
where
the
like
a
painted
ship
graced
a
painted
ocean
my
boy
trimmer
was
saying
i
have
made
the
public
stop
look
and
listen
when
i
get
my
last
publicity
in
the
shape
of
an
let
them
run
that
tag
on
my
headstone
and
the
story
of
me
that
i
guess
will
be
told
longest
after
i
am
gone
is
the
one
about
the
grape
juice
that
i
he
paused
his
audience
was
not
listening
he
felt
it
intuitively
minot
sat
with
his
eyes
on
the
in
the
bow
of
that
handsome
boat
a
red
light
had
been
waved
three
times
mr
trimmer
minot
said
your
tales
are
more
interesting
than
the
classics
he
stood
some
other
time
i
hope
to
hear
a
continuation
of
them
just
at
present
lord
harrowby
or
if
you
prefer
is
waiting
to
hear
what
arrangement
i
have
made
with
you
you
must
pardon
me
i
can
talk
as
we
walk
along
said
trimmer
and
proved
it
in
the
middle
of
the
deserted
plaza
they
separated
at
the
dark
stage
door
of
the
trimmer
sought
his
proposition
who
mean
asked
the
lone
there
george
lord
harrowby
insisted
mr
trimmer
oh
that
bum
actor
seen
him
going
away
a
while
back
with
two
men
that
called
for
him
bum
actor
cried
trimmer
indignantly
he
stopped
two
men
who
were
they
the
asked
profanely
how
he
could
know
that
and
mr
trimmer
hurriedly
departed
for
the
where
he
and
his
fallen
nobleman
shared
a
suite
about
the
same
time
dick
minot
blithely
entered
lord
apartments
in
the
hotel
de
la
pax
well
he
announced
you
can
cheer
up
little
george
is
painlessly
removed
he
sleeps
aboard
the
good
ship
thanks
to
the
efforts
of
martin
wall
assisted
by
yours
truly
he
stopped
and
stared
in
awe
at
his
lordship
what
the
matter
with
you
he
inquired
harrowby
waved
a
hopeless
hand
minot
he
said
it
was
good
of
you
but
while
you
have
been
assisting
me
so
kindly
in
that
quarter
another
and
a
greater
blow
has
fallen
good
lord
what
cried
minot
it
is
no
fault
of
mine
harrowby
began
on
which
i
would
have
gambled
my
immortal
soul
minot
said
i
thought
it
was
all
over
and
done
with
five
years
ago
i
was
young
sentimental
and
grease
paint
and
that
sort
of
thing
hit
i
saw
her
from
the
stalls
fell
desperately
in
love
stayed
so
for
six
months
wrote
letters
burning
letters
and
now
yes
and
now
now
she
here
gabrielle
rose
is
here
she
here
with
the
letters
oh
for
a
cotrell
ink
eraser
minot
groaned
my
man
saw
her
went
on
harrowby
mopping
his
damp
forehead
fifty
thousand
she
wants
for
the
letters
or
she
gives
them
to
a
newspaper
and
begins
to
sue
at
once
i
suppose
said
minot
she
is
the
usual
gaiety
girl
not
the
usual
old
chap
quite
a
remarkable
woman
she
do
what
she
promises
trust
her
and
i
have
a
farthing
minot
it
all
up
now
there
no
way
out
of
this
minot
sat
thinking
the
telephone
rang
i
wo

to
her
cried
harrowby
in
a
panic
i
wo
have
anything
to
do
with
her
minot
old
chap
as
a
favor
to
me
the
old
family
solicitor
smiled
minot
that
me
he
took
down
the
receiver
but
no
voice
that
had
charmed
thousands
at
the
gaiety
answered
his
instead
there
came
over
the
wire
heated
raging
the
tones
of
henry
trimmer
hello

want
allan
harrowby
ah

minot

friend

on
the
minot
replied
it

his
vaudeville
partner

sat
down

here
harrowby
he
said
it
was
the
first
time

unholy
lot
of
things

to
spoil
this
wedding
so

going
to

not
very
expert
in
your
astounding
language

and

sleep
of
the
innocent
but
where

went

slammed
the
door
on
a
peer
sticking
above
the
knob
of
the

he
found
a
telegram
turning
on
his
lights
he
sank
wearily
down
on
the

tore
it
open
it
rained
in

said
the

arrived
with
a
package
of
letters
that
screamed
for

two
strangers
invaded
san
marco
by
means
of
the
freight
south
frayed
fatigued
and
famished
as
they
were
it
would
hardly
have
been
kind
to
study
them
as
they
strolled
up
san
sebastian
avenue
toward
the
plaza
but
had
you
been
so
unkind
you
would
never
have
guessed
that
frequently
in
various
corners
of
the
little
round
globe
they
had
known
prosperity
the
weekly

and
the
buyer
crook
of

summoning
a

one
of
the
strangers
was
short
with
flaming
red
hair
and
in
his
eye
the
twinkle
without
which
the
collected
works
of
bernard
shaw
are
as
sounding
brass
he
twinkled
about
him
as
he
walked
at
the
bright
lights
and
spurious
gaiety
under
the
spell
of
which
san
marco
sought
to
forget
the
rates
per
day
with
bath
the
french
he
mused
are
a
volatile
people
fond
of
light
wines
and
dancing
so
it
would
seem
are
the
inhabitants
of

white
flannels
they
should
encase

call

in
a
gentle
melancholy

another

packed
with
innocents
abroad
and
everybody
bleeding
but
us
everything
here
but
a
real
home
with
chintz
and
a
cold
roast
of
beef
in
the
what
are
we
doing
here
we
should
have
gone
north
ah
harry
chide
me
no
more
pleaded
the
little
man
i
was
weak
i
know
but
all
the
freights
seemed
to
be
coming
south
and
i
have
always
longed
for
a
winter
amid
the
sunshine
and
flowers
look
at
this
fat
old
duffer
coming

the
love
of

growled
the
thin
one
save
your
breath
till
we
stand
hat
in
hand
in
the
office
of
the
local
newspaper
a
job
two
jobs
good
lord
there
are
two
newspaper
jobs
in
the
entire
south
well
we
can
only
be
kicked
out
into
the
night
again
and
perhaps
staked
to
a
meal
in
the
name
of
the
guild
in
which
we
have
served
so
long
and
liquidly
some
day
said
the
short
man
dreamily
when
i
am
back
in
the
haunts
of
civilization
again
i
am
going
to
start
something
a
society
for
melting
the
stone
hearts
of
editors
motto
a
heart
have
a
heart
emblem
a
roast
beef
sandwich
rampant
on
a
cloth
of
linen
ah
well
the
day
will
come
they
halted
in
the
plaza
in
the
round
stone
tub
provided
the
town
alligator
dozed
above
him
hung
a
warning
sign
do
not
feed
or
otherwise
annoy
the
alligator
the
short
man
read
and
drew
back
with
a
tragic
groan
feed
or
otherwise
annoy
he
cried
heavens
harry
is
that
the
way
they
look
at
it
here
this
is
no
place
for
us
we
better
be
moving
on
to
the
next
town
but
the
lean
stranger
gave
no
heed
instead
he
stepped
over
and
entered
into
earnest
converse
with
a
citizen
of
san
marco
in
a
moment
he
returned
to
his
companion
side
one
newspaper
he
announced
the
suppose
the
office
is
locked
for
the
night
but
come
along
let
try
feed
or
otherwise
annoy
muttered
the
little
man
blankly
for
the
love
of
allah
alms
they
traversed
several
side
streets
and
came
at
last
to
the
office
of
the
it
was
a
modest
structure
verging
on
decay
one
man
sat
alone
in
the
dim
interior
reading
exchanges
under
an
electric
lamp
good
evening
said
the
short
man
genially
are
you
the
editor
uh
huh
responded
the
man
without
enthusiasm
from
under
his
green
glad
to
know
you
we
just
dropped
in
a
couple
of
newspaper
men
you
know
this
is
harry
howe
until
recently
managing
editor
of
the
mobile
my
own
name
is
robert
a
humble
editorial
writer
on
the
same
sheet
uh
huh
if
you
had
jobs
for
god
sake
why
did
you
leave
them
ah
you
may
well
ask
the
one
dropped
uninvited
into
a
chair
old
man
it
a
dramatic
story
the
chief
of
police
of
mobile
happened
to
be
a
crook
and
a
grafter
and
we
happened
to
mention
it
in
the
night
before
last
armed
cops
invaded
the
peace
and
sanctity
of
our
sanctum
harry
and
i
pure
accident
landed
in
the
same
general
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
out
back
and
here
we
are
here
we
are
my
newspaper
instinct
said
the
man
had
already
enabled
me
to
gather
that
last
sarcasm
it
was
a
bad
sign
but
blithely
bob
continued
here
we
are
he
said
two
experienced
newspaper
men
down
and
out
we
thought
there
might
possibly
be
a
vacancy
or
two
on
the
staff
of
your
paper
the
editor
threw
off
his
revealing
a
cynical
face
boys
he
said
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
been
running
this
alleged
newspaper
for
two
long
dreary
years
and
this
laugh
you
just
handed
me
is
the
first
i
had
during
that
time
vacancies
there
is
one
a
big
one
see
my
pocket
for
particulars
two
years
boys
and
all
the
time
hoping
praying
that
some
day
make
two
dollars
and
sixty
cents
which
is
the
railroad
fare
to
the
next
town
howe
and
listened
with
faces
that
steadily
grew
more
sorrowful
i
like
to
stake
you
to
a
meal
the
editor
went
on
but
a
first
duty
is
to
his
family
any
burglar
will
tell
you
that
i
suppose
ventured
most
of
the
flash
gone
from
his
manner
there
is
no
other
newspaper
here
no
there
is
there
a
weird
thing
here
called
the
marco
a
morning
outrage
it
making
money
but
by
different
methods
than
i
care
to
use
you
might
try
there
you
look
unlucky
perhaps
they
take
you
on
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
gave
them
directions
for
reaching
the
office
good
night
boys
he
said
thank
you
for
calling
you
the
first
newspaper
men
i
seen
in
two
years
except
when
i
looked
in
the
glass
and
the
other
day
i
broke
my
good
night
and
bad
luck
go
with
you
to
the
extent
of
jobs
on
the
cynic
breathed
in
the
street
a
bitter
tongue
maketh
a
sour
face
i
liked
him
not
a
morning
outrage
called
the
sounds
promising
like
smallpox
in
the
next
county
we
shall
see
said
howe
that
which
meets
our
vision
forward
march
the
alligator
and
i
muttered
famished
perishing
for
the
love
of
allah
as
i
remarked
before
alms
in
the
dark
hallway
where
the
office
was
suspected
of
being
they
groped
about
determinedly
no
sign
of
any
nature
proclaimed
san
marco
only
morning
paper
a
solitary
light
shining
through
a
transom
beckoned
boldly
pushed
open
the
door
to
the
knowing
nostrils
of
the
two
birds
of
passage
was
wafted
the
odor
they
loved
the
unique
inky
odor
of
a
newspaper
shop
their
eyes
beheld
a
rather
bare
room
a
typewriter
or
two
a
desk
in
the
center
of
the
room
was
a
small
table
under
an
electric
lamp
on
this
table
was
a
bottle
and
glasses
and
at
it
two
silent
men
played
poker
one
of
the
men
was
burly
and
bearded
the
other
was
slight
pale
nervous
from
an
inner
room
came
the
click
of
linotypes
lonesome
linotypes
that
seemed
to
have
strayed
far
from
their
native
haunts
the
two
men
finished
playing
the
hand
and
looked
up
good
evening
said
with
a
smile
that
had
drawn
news
as
a
magnet
draws
steel
in
many
odd
corners
gentlemen
four
newspaper
men
meet
in
a
strange
land
i
perceive
you
have
on
the
table
a
greeting
unquestionably
suitable
the
bearded
man
laughed
rose
and
discovered
two
extra
glasses
on
a
shelf
draw
up
he
said
heartily
the
place
is
yours
you
as
welcome
as
thanks
reached
for
a
glass
let
me
introduce
ourselves
and
he
mentioned
his

name
and

said
the
bearded

with
joy
glory
be
do
you
hear
that
harry
these
gentlemen
all
alone
on
the
premises
he
leaned
over
and
poured
out
eloquently
the
story
of
the
tragic
flight
from
mobile
i
call
this
luck
he
finished
here
we
are
broke
eager
for
work
and
we
find
you
minus
a
stopped
for
he
had
seen
a
sickly
smile
of
derision
float
across
the
face
of
the
weary
city
editor
and
he
saw
the
bearded
man
shaking
his
great
head
violently
nothing
doing
said
the
bearded
man
firmly
sorry
to
dash
your
hopes
always
ready
to
pour
another
drink

the
city
editor
warmly
into
their
boots
tumbled
the
hearts
of
the
two
strangers
in
a
strange
land
gloom
and
hunger
engulfed
them
but
the
managing
editor
of
the
was
continuing
and
what
was
this
he
was
saying
no
boys

do
need

staff

just
as
much
use
for
a
manicure
set
but
you
come
at
an
opportune
time

tickles
the
soles
of
four
feet
and
those
four
feet
are
editorial
feet
on
the
something
tells
us
that
we
are
going
away

the
two
strangers

his
head

my
park

put
crinkling

and
then
gliding
still
like

he
looked
he
went
out

hour
later
they
sent
the

to

and
sought
the
grill

of
the
hotel

as
they
came
happily
away
from

chapter
xi
tears
from
the
gaiety
friday
morning
found
minot
ready
for
whatever
diplomacy
the
day
might
demand
of
him
he
had
a
feeling
that
the
demand
would
be
great
the
unheralded
arrival
of
miss
gabrielle
rose
and
her
packet
of
letters
presented
no
slight
complication
whatever
the
outcome
of
any
suit
she
might
start
against
harrowby
minot
was
sure
that
the
mere
announcement
of
it
would
be
sufficient
to
blast
jephson
hopes
for
all
time
old
spencer
meyrick
already
inflamed
by
the
episode
of
the
elder
brother
was
not
likely
to
take
coolly
the
publication
of
incriminating
letters
after
an
early
breakfast
minot
sent
a
cable
to
jephson
telling
of
miss
rose
arrival
and
asking
for
information
about
her
next
he
sought
an
interview
with
the
gaiety
lady
an
hour
later
in
a
pink
and
gold
parlor
of
the
hotel
de
la
pax
he
stood
gazing
into
the
eyes
of
miss
gabrielle
rose
it
goes
without
saying
that
miss
rose
was
pretty
innocent
she
seemed
too
with
a
baby
stare
that
said
as
plainly
as
words
please
do
harm
me
will
you
but
ah
well
lord
harrowby
was
not
the
first
to
learn
that
a
business
woman
may
lurk
back
of
a
baby
stare
you
come
from
lord
harrowby
and
the
smile
that
had
decorated
ten
million
postcards
throughout
the
united
kingdom
flashed
on
minot
wo
you
sit
down
thanks
minot
fidgeted
he
had
no
idea
what
to
say
time
it
was
time
he
must
fight
for
as
he
was
fighting
with
trimmer
er
miss
rose
he
began
when
i
started
out
on
this
errand
i
had
misgivings
but
now
that
i
have
seen
you
they
are
gone
everything
will
be
all
right
i
know
i
have
come
to
ask
that
you
show
lord
harrowby
some
leniency
the
eyes
hardened
you
have
come
on
a
hopeless
errand
mr
er
minot
why
should
i
show
harrowby
any
consideration
did
he
show
me
any
when
he
broke
his
word
to
me
and
made
me
the
of
the
town
but
that
all
happened
five
years
ago
yes
but
it
is
as
vivid
as
though
it
were
yesterday
i
have
always
intended
to
demand
some
redress
from
his
lordship
but
my
art
minot
you
have
no
idea
how
exacting
art
can
be
not
until
now
have
i
been
in
a
position
to
do
so
and
the
fact
that
not
until
now
has
his
lordship
proposed
to
marry
some
one
else
that
of
course
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
mr
minot
a
delightful
pout
if
you
knew
me
better
you
could
not
possibly
ask
that
miss
rose
you
a
clever
woman
oh
please
do
i
hate
clever
women
and
i
sure
you
do
too
not
a
bit
clever
and
i
proud
of
it
on
the
contrary
i
rather
weak
rather
easily
got
round
but
when
i
think
of
the
position
allan
put
me
in
even
a
weak
woman
can
be
firm
in
the
circumstances
have
it
your
own
way
said
minot
bowing
but
you
are
at
least
clever
enough
to
understand
the
futility
of
demanding
financial
redress
from
a
man
who
is
flat
broke
i
assure
you
lord
harrowby
has
a
shilling
i
do
believe
it
he
can
get
money
somehow
he
always
could
the
courts
can
force
him
to
i
shall
tell
my
lawyer
to
go
ahead
with
the
suit
if
you
would
only
delay
a
week
impossible
miss
rose
spoke
with
haughty
languor
i
begin
rehearsals
in
new
york
in
a
week
no
i
shall
start
suit
you
may
tell
lord
harrowby
so
poor
jephson
minot
had
a
mental
picture
of
the
little
bald
man
writing
at
that
very
moment
a
terribly
large
check
for
the
dowager
duchess
of
tremayne
paying
for
the
rain
that
had
fallen
in
torrents
he
must
at
least
hold
this
woman
off
until
jephson
answered
his
cable
miss
rose
he
pleaded
grant
us
one
favor
do
not
make
public
your
suit
against
harrowby
until
i
have
seen
you
again
say
at
four
this
afternoon
coldly
she
shook
her
head
but
you
have
already
waited
five
years
surely
you
can
wait
another
five
hours
as
a
very
great
favor
to
me
i
should
like
to
since
you
put
it
that
way
but
it
impossible
sorry
the
great
beauty
and
business
woman
leaned
closer
minot
you
can
hardly
realize
what
allan
unkindness
cost
me
in
bitter
tears
i
loved
him
once
and
i
believe
he
loved
me
there
can
not
be
any
question
about
that
ah
flattery
no
spoken
from
the
heart
really
my
dear
lady
i
should
like
to
be
your
press
agent
i
could
write
the
most
gorgeous
things
about
you
and
no
one
could
say
i
lied
you
men
are
so
nice
she
gurgled
when
you
want
to
be
ah
yes
gabrielle
rose
had
always
found
them
so
and
had
yet
to
meet
one
not
worth
her
while
to
capture
she
turned
the
baby
stare
full
on
minot
even
to
a
beauty
of
the
theater
he
was
an
ingratiating
picture
she
rose
and
strolled
to
a
piano
in
one
corner
of
the
room
minot
followed
when
harrowby
first
met
me
she
said
her
fingers
on
the
keys
i
was
singing
a
my
first
dear
song
ah
minot
i
was
happy
then
in
another
minute
she
began
to
sing
softly
a
plaintive
little
and
in
spite
of
himself
minot
felt
his
heart
beat
faster
how
it
brings
back
the
old
days
she
whispered
the
lights
and
the
friendly
faces
harrowby
in
the
stalls
and
the
little
suppers
after
the
show
she
leaned
forward
and
sang
at
minot
as
she
had
sung
at
harrowby
five
years
before
you
could
love
me
just
a
little
if
you
tried
you
could
feel
your
heart
go
inside
really
she
had
a
way
with
her
dear
it
easy
if
you
try
cross
your
heart
and
hope
to
die
do
you
love
me
just
a
little
now
that
baby
stare
in
all
its
pathos
all
its
appealing
helplessness
was
focused
full
on
minot
he
gripped
the
arms
of
his
chair
gabrielle
rose
saw
had
she
made
another
captive
so
it
seemed
she
felt
very
kindly
toward
the
world
promise
minot
leaned
over
his
voice
was
hoarse
you
meet
me
here
at
four
quite
aside
from
my
errand
quite
aside
from
everything
i
want
to
see
you
again
do
you
really
she
continued
to
hum
beneath
her
breath
very
well
here
at
four
and
he
hesitated
fearing
to
break
the
spell
in
the
meantime
in
the
meantime
she
said
i
think
only
of
four
minot
left
that
pink
and
gold
parlor
at
sea
in
several
respects
the
theory
was
that
he
had
played
with
this
famous
actress
wound
her
round
his
finger
cajoled
a
delay
but
somehow
he
did
feel
exactly
as
one
who
has
mastered
a
delicate
situation
should
instead
he
felt
dazed
by
the
beauty
of
her
still
more
was
he
at
sea
as
to
what
he
was
going
to
do
at
four
of
what
good
was
the
delay
if
he
could
not
make
use
of
it
and
at
the
moment
he
had
the
slightest
notion
of
what
he
could
do
to
prepare
himself
for
the
afternoon
interview
he
must
wait
for
cable
perhaps
that
would
give
him
an
idea
minot
was
walking
blankly
down
the
street
in
the
direction
of
his
morning
paper
when
a
poster
in
a
deserted
store
window
caught
his
eye
it
was
an
atrocious
poster
red
letters
on
a
yellow
background
it
announced
that
five
hundred
dollars
reward
would
be
paid
by
henry
trimmer
for
information
that
would
disclose
the
present
whereabouts
of
the
real
lord
harrowby
as
minot
stood
reading
it
a
heavy
hand
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
turning
he
looked
into
the
lean
and
hostile
face
of
henry
trimmer
himself
good
morning
said
mr
trimmer
good
morning
replied
minot
glad
to
number
you
among
my
readers
sneered
trimmer
what
do
you
think
reward
large
enough
looks
about
the
right
size
to
me
minot
answered
me
too
ought
to
bring
results
pretty
quick
by
the
way
you
were
complaining
last
night
that
you
never
heard
of
me
until
you
came
here
i
been
thinking
that
over
and
i
decided
to
make
up
to
you
in
the
next
few
days
for
all
those
lonely
years
but
the
morning
had
been
too
much
for
minot
worried
distressed
he
lost
for
the
moment
his
usual
smiling
urbanity
oh
go
to
the
devil
he
said
and
walked
away
lunch
time
came
two
at
half
past
two
out
of
london
jephson
spoke
said
his
cable
know
nothing
of
except
that
she
been
married
frequently
do
best
you
can
and
what
help
was
this
pray
disgustedly
minot
read
the
cable
again
four
was
coming
on
apace
and
with
every
tick
of
the
clock
his
feeling
of
helplessness
grew
he
mentally
berated
thacker
and
jephson
they
left
him
alone
to
grapple
with
wild
problems
offering
no
help
and
asking
miracles
confound
them
both
three
came
what
what
was
he
to
say
lord
harrowby
interrogated
was
merely
useless
and
frantic
he
could
raise
a
shilling
he
could
offer
a
suggestion
dear
old
chap
he
moaned
i
depend
on
you
well
thacker
and
jephson
had
asked
the
impossible
that
was
all
minot
felt
he
had
done
his
best
no
man
could
do
more
he
was
very
sorry
for
jephson
but
golden
before
him
opened
the
possibility
of
miss
cynthia
meyrick
free
to
be
wooed
yet
he
must
be
faithful
to
the
last
at
a
quarter
to
four
he
read
jephson
cablegram
again
as
he
read
a
plan
ridiculous
in
its
ineffectiveness
occurred
to
him
and
since
no
other
came
in
the
interval
before
four
he
walked
into
miss
rose
presence
determined
to
try
out
his
weak
little
bluff
the
gaiety
lady
was
playing
on
the
piano
a
whispering
seductive
little
tune
as
minot
stepped
to
her
side
she
glanced
up
at
him
with
a
coy
inviting
smile
but
she
drew
back
a
little
at
his
determined
glare
miss
rose
he
said
sharply
i
have
discovered
that
you
can
not
sue
lord
harrowby
for
breach
of
contract
to
marry
you
why
why
not
she
stammered
because
said
minot
with
a
triumphant
smile
though
it
was
a
shot
in
the
dark
you
already
had
a
husband
when
those
letters
were
written
to
you
well
he
had
done
his
best
a
rather
childish
effort
but
what
else
was
there
to
attempt
poor
old
jephson
nonsense
said
the
gaiety
lady
and
continued
to
play
nothing
of
the
sort
minot
replied
why
i
can
produce
the
man
himself
might
as
well
go
the
limit
while
he
was
about
it
that
should
be
his
consolation
when
jephson
lost
might
as
well
but
what
was
this
gabrielle
rose
had
turned
livid
with
anger
her
lips
twitched
her
eyes
flashed
fire
if
only
her
lawyer
had
been
by
her
side
then
but
he
was
and
so
she
cried
hotly
he
told
the
little
brute
told
good
lord
minot
felt
his
knees
weaken
a
shot
in
the
dark
had
it
hit
the
target
after
all
if
you
refer
to
your
husband
said
minot
he
has
done
just
that
he
not
my
husband
she
snapped
oh
what
was
the
use
providence
was
with
jephson
no
of
course
not
not
since
the
divorce
minot
answered
but
he
was
when
those
letters
were
written
the
gaiety
lady
chin
began
to
tremble
and
he
promised
me
on
his
word
of
honor
that
he
would
tell
but
i
suppose
you
found
him
easy
what
honor
could
one
expect
in
a
persian
carpet
dealer
a
persian
carpet
dealer
into
minot
mind
floated
a
scrap
of
conversation
heard
at
bruce
table
but
you
must
remember
he
ventured
that
he
is
also
a
prince
yes
said
the
woman
that
what
i
thought
when
i
married
him
the
prince
of
liars
that
as
far
as
his
royal
blood
goes
a
silence
while
miss
gabrielle
rose
felt
in
her
sleeve
for
her
handkerchief
i
suppose
minot
suggested
you
will
abandon
the
suit
she
looked
at
him
oh
the
pathos
of
that
baby
stare
you
are
acting
in
this
matter
simply
as
harrowby
friend
she
asked
simply
as
his
friend
and
so
far
only
you
know
of
my
er
only
i
know
of
him
smiled
minot
the
smile
died
from
his
face
for
he
saw
bright
tears
on
the
long
lashes
of
the
gaiety
lady
she
leaned
close
minot
she
said
it
is
i
who
need
a
friend
not
harrowby
i
am
here
in
a
strange
country
without
funds
alone
helpless
minot
you
could
not
be
so
cruel
i
i
i
sorry
said
minot
uncomfortably
the
lady
was
an
actress
and
she
acted
now
beautifully
i
i
feel
so
desolate
she
moaned
dabbing
daintily
at
her
eyes
you
will
help
me
it
can
not
be
i
am
mistaken
in
you
i
thought
did
i
imagine
it
this
morning
when
i
sang
for
you
you
liked
me
just
a
little
nervously
minot
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
he
tried
to
answer
but
his
voice
seemed
lost
just
a
very
little
she
too
rose
and
placed
her
butterfly
hands
on
his
shoulders
you
do
like
me
just
a
little
do
you
her
pleading
eyes
gazed
into
his
it
was
a
touching
scene
to
be
besought
thus
tenderly
by
a
famous
beauty
in
the
secluded
parlor
of
a
southern
hotel
the
touch
of
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
thrilled
him
the
odor
of
jockey
club
it
was
at
this
instant
that
minot
looking
past
the
gaiety
beautiful
golden
coiffure
beheld
miss
cynthia
meyrick
standing
in
the
doorway
of
that
parlor
a
smile
on
her
face
she
disappeared
on
the
instant
but
gabrielle
rose
big
scene
was
ruined
beyond
repair
my
dear
lady
gently
minot
slipped
from
beneath
her
lovely
hands
i
assure
you
i
do
like
you
more
than
a
little
but
unfortunately
my
loyalty
to
harrowby
no
i
wo
say
that
circumstances
are
such
that
i
can
not
be
your
friend
in
this
instance
though
if
i
could
serve
you
in
any
other
way
gabrielle
rose
snapped
her
fingers
very
well
her
voice
had
a
metallic
ring
now
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
undoubtedly
i
bid
you
good
day
as
minot
somewhat
dazed
walked
along
the
veranda
of
the
de
la
pax
he
met
miss
meyrick
there
was
a
mischievous
gleam
in
her
eye
really
it
was
so
tactless
of
me
minot
she
said
a
thousand
apologies
he
pretended
not
to
understand
my
untimely
descent
on
the
parlor
she
beamed
on
him
i
presume
it
happened
because
romance
draws
me
like
a
magnet
even
other
people
minot
smiled
wanly
and
for
once
sought
to
end
their
talk
oh
do
sit
down
just
a
moment
she
pleaded
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
great
service
you
did
harrowby
and
me
last
night
wha
what
service
asked
minot
sinking
into
a
chair
she
leaned
close
and
spoke
in
a
whisper
your
part
in
the
kidnaping
harrowby
has
told
me
it
was
sweet
of
you
so
unselfish
damn
thought
minot
and
then
he
thought
two
more
to
put
yourself
out
that
our
wedding
may
be
a
success
was
this
sarcasm
minot
wondered
i
so
glad
to
know
about
it
minot
it
shows
me
at
last
just
what
you
think
is
she
looked
away
best
for
me
best
for
you
what
do
you
mean
ca
you
understand
from
some
things
you
said
i
have
thought
perhaps
you
did
just
approve
of
my
marriage
and
now
i
see
i
misconstrued
you
utterly
you
want
me
to
marry
harrowby
you
working
for
it
i
should
be
surprised
if
you
were
on
that
train
last
monday
just
to
make
sure
that
i
get
here
safely
really
it
was
inhuman
did
she
realize
how
inhuman
it
was
one
glance
at
minot
might
have
told
her
but
she
was
still
looking
away
so
i
want
to
thank
you
minot
she
went
on
i
shall
always
remember
your
kindness
i
could
understand
at
first
but
now
i
wonder
you
know
it
an
old
theory
that
as
soon
as
one
has
one
own
affair
of
the
heart
arranged
one
begins
to
plan
for
others
minot
made
a
little
whistling
sound
through
his
clenched
teeth
the
girl
stood
up
your
thoughtfulness
has
made
me
very
happy
she
laughed
it
shows
that
perhaps
you
care
for
me
just
a
little
too
she
was
gone
minot
sat
swearing
softly
to
himself
banging
the
arm
of
his
chair
with
his
fist
he
raged
at
thacker
jephson
the
solar
system
gradually
his
anger
cooled
underneath
the
raillery
in
cynthia
meyrick
tone
he
had
thought
he
detected
something
of
a
serious
note
as
though
she
were
a
little
wistful
a
little
hurt
did
she
care
thought
in
the
midst
of
all
this
farce
and
melodrama
had
she
come
to
care
just
a
little
just
a
little
bah
minot
rose
and
went
out
on
the
avenue
prince
navin
bey
imno
was
accustomed
to
give
lectures
twice
daily
on
the
textures
of
his
precious
rugs
at
his
shop
in
the
alameda
courtyard
his
afternoon
lecture
was
just
finished
as
minot
stepped
into
the
shop
a
dozen
awed
housewives
from
the
middle
west
were
hurrying
away
to
write
home
on
the
hotel
stationery
that
they
had
met
a
prince
when
the
last
one
had
gone
out
minot
stepped
forward
prince
i
dropped
in
to
warn
you
a
very
angry
woman
will
be
here
shortly
to
see
you
the
handsome
young
persian
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
took
off
the
jacket
of
the
native
uniform
with
which
he
embellished
his
talks
why
is
she
angry
all
my
rugs
they
are
what
i
say
they
are
in
this
town
are
many
liars
selling
oriental
rugs

ugh
in
new
jersey

were
made
but

in
my
native
country
where
i
was
a
prince
of
the
yes

i
refer
to
your
ah

mistaken
i
have
never
married
oh
yes

i
know
all
about
it
there
no
need
to
lie
the
whole
story
is
out
and
the
lady
game
in
san
marco
is
queered
she
thinks
you
told
that
why
she
be
here
for
a
chat
but
i
did
not
tell
only
this
morning
did
i
see
her
first
i
could
not
tell
so
soon
who
could
i
tell
so
soon
i
know
you
did
tell
but
can
you
prove
it
to
an
agitated
lady
no
you
better
close
up
for
the
evening
ah
yes
you
are
right
i
am
innocent
but
what
does
gabrielle
care
for
innocence
we
are
no
longer
married
still
i
should
not
want
to
meet
her
now
i
will
close
but
first
my
friend
my
benefactor
could
i
interest
you
in
this
rug
see
only
in
my
native
country
where
prince
said
minot
i
could
use
a
rug
if
you
gave
me
one
that
is
exactly
what
i
would
do
you
are
my
friend
you
serve
me
i
give
you
this
fifty
dollars
that
is
giving
it
to
you
note
the
weave
only
in
my
good
night
interrupted
minot
and
take
my
advice
hurry
gloomy
discouraged
he
turned
back
toward
his
own
hotel
it
was
true
gabrielle
rose
husband
at
the
time
of
the
letters
was
in
san
marco
the
emissary
of
jephson
was
serving
a
cause
that
could
not
lose
that
afternoon
he
had
hoped
was
there
anything
dishonorable
in
that
jephson
and
thacker
could
command
his
service
they
could
not
command
his
heart
he
had
hoped
and
now
at
a
corner
a
negro
gave
him
a
handbill
he
read
who
has
kidnaped
the
real
lord
harrowby
at
the
henry
trimmer
will
appear
in
place
of
his
unfortunate
friend
lord
harrowby
and
will
make
a
few
warm
and
sizzling
remarks
no
advance
in
prices
minot
tossed
the
bill
into
the
street
into
his
eyes
came
the
ghostlike
semblance
of
a
smile
after
all
the
famous
harrowby
wedding
had
not
yet
taken
place
chapter
xii
exit
a
lady
laughingly
after
dinner
minot
lighted
a
cigar
and
descended
into
the
hotel
gardens
for
a
stroll
farther
and
farther
he
strayed
down
the
shadowy
gravel
paths
until
only
the
faint
far
suggestion
of
music
at
his
back
recalled
the
hotel
lights
and
gaiety
it
was
a
deserted
land
he
penetrated
just
one
figure
did
he
encounter
in
a
fifteen
walk
a
little
man
clad
all
in
white
scurrying
like
a
wraith
in
the
black
shade
of
the
royal
palms
at
a
distant
corner
of
the
grounds
near
the
was
a
in
which
tea
was
served
of
an
afternoon
into
this
minot
strolled
to
finish
his
cigar
and
ponder
the
day
developments
in
the
drama
he
was
playing
as
he
drew
a
comfortable
chair
from
moonlight
into
shadow
he
heard
a
little
gasp
at
his
elbow
and
turning
beheld
a
beautiful
vision
gabrielle
rose
was
made
for
the
spotlight
and
that
being
absent
moonlight
served
as
well
under
its
soft
merciful
rays
she
stood
revealed
the
beauty
thousands
of
playgoers
knew
and
worshiped
dick
minot
gazed
at
her
in
awe
he
was
surprised
that
she
held
out
her
hand
to
him
a
smile
of
the
utmost
friendliness
on
her
face
how
fortunate
she
said
as
though
speaking
the
cue
for
a
lovely
song
i
stand
here
the
wonder
of
this
old
spanish
night
getting
into
my
very
blood
and
the
only
thing
lacking
in
the
picture
is
a
man
and
then
you
come
i
glad
to
be
of
service
said
minot
tossing
away
his
cigar
what
an
unromantic
way
to
put
it
really
this
chance
meeting
it
was
a
chance
meeting
i
suppose
a
lucky
chance
he
agreed
she
pouted
then
you
did
not
follow
unromantic
to
the
last
but
as
i
was
saying
this
chance
meeting
is
splendid
my
train
goes
in
an
hour
and
i
wanted
so
very
much
to
see
you
once
again
you
flatter
me
ah
you
do
understand
she
dropped
into
a
chair
i
wanted
to
see
you
to
put
your
conscience
at
rest
you
were
so
sorry
when
you
had
to
be
cruel
to
me
you
will
be
so
glad
to
know
that
it
has
all
turned
out
happily
after
all
what
do
you
mean
asked
minot
new
apprehensions
rising
in
his
mind
alas
if
i
could
only
tell
you
she
was
laughing
at
him
now
an
experience
he
did
not
relish
but
my
lips
are
sealed
as
we
say
on
the
stage
i
can
only
give
you
the
hint
you
thought
you
left
me
a
broken
vanquished
woman
how
the
thought
did
pain
you
well
your
victory
was
not
absolute
let
that
thought
console
you
you
are
too
kind
minot
answered
and
you
are
glad
i
am
not
leaving
san
marco
quite
beaten
oh
yes
i
wild
with
pleasure
really
that
is
sweet
of
you
i
am
so
sorry
we
must
part
the
moonlight
the
palms
the
distant
music
all
so
romantic
but
we
shall
meet
again
i
do
know
do
know
how
unkind
when
it
all
depends
on
you
you
will
look
me
up
in
new
york
wo
you
new
york
is
not
so
romantic
but
i
shall
try
to
make
it
up
to
you
i
shall
sing
for
you
a
she
stood
up
and
held
out
a
slim
white
hand
mr
minot
still
she
laughed
it
has
been
so
good
to
know
you
er
said
minot
he
took
the
hand
he
heard
her
humming
beneath
her
breath
humming
a
i
enjoyed
your
singing
immensely
she
laughed
outright
now
a
silvery
joyous
laugh
and
refusing
the
baffled
minot
offer
to
take
her
back
to
the
hotel
she
fled
away
from
him
down
the
dark
path
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
and
lighted
another
cigar
exit
the
gaiety
lady
laughing
merrily
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
what
new
complication
must
he
meet
and
solve
for
his
answer
he
had
only
to
return
to
the
hotel
on
the
steps
he
was
met
by
lord
harrowby
man
agitated
puffing
been
looking
all
about
for
you
sir
he
announced
lordship
wishes
to
see
you
at
once
most
more
trouble
minot
was
lord
harrowby
gloomy
greeting
sit
down
old
chap
just
had
a
very
nasty
visitor
sorry
to
hear
it
little
brown
monkey
of
a
man
manuel
gonzale
proprietor
of
the
marco
i
say
old
boy
there
a
syllable
missing
in
the
name
of
that
paper
do
you
get
me
you
mean
it
should
be
the
marco
pretty
good
harrowby
pretty
good
and
minot
added
to
himself
for
you
that
exactly
what
i
do
mean
gabrielle
has
sold
out
her
bunch
of
letters
to
gonzale
and
it
appears
from
the
chap
sly
hints
that
unless
i
pay
him
ten
thousand
dollars
before
midnight
the
best
of
those
letters
will
be
in
he
got
his
nerve
working
a
game
like
that
said
minot
nerve
not
at
all
replied
harrowby
he
as
safe
as
a
child
in
its
own
nursery
he
knows
as
well
as
anybody
that
the
last
thing
i
do
would
be
to
appeal
to
the
police
too
much
publicity
down
that
road
well
his
price
is
a
bit
cheaper
than
gabrielle
yes
but
not
cheap
enough
i
broke
old
boy
the
governor
and
i
are
on
very
poor
terms
should
think
of
appealing
to
him
we
might
pawn
chain
lightning
collar
minot
suggested
never
there
must
be
some
way
only
three
days
before
the
wedding
we
must
lose
on
the
stretch
old
boy
a
pause
minot
sat
glumly
have
you
no
suggestion
harrowby
asked
anxiously
i
have
not
said
minot
rising
but
i
perceive
clearly
that
it
now
devolves
on
little
dicky
minot
to
up
and
don
his
fighting
armor
once
more
really
old
boy
i
sorry
said
harrowby
i
hoping
things
may
quiet
down
a
bit
after
a
time
so
am
i
replied
minot
with
feeling
if
they
do
i
can
see
nervous
prostration
and
a
hospital
cot
ahead
for
me
you
stay
here
and
study
the
marriage
service
i
going
out
on
the
broad
highway
again
he
went
down
into
the
lobby
and
tore
jack
paddock
away
from
the
side
of
one
of
the
omaha
beauties
paddock
was
resplendent
in
evening
clothes
and
thoughtful
for
on
the
morrow
bruce
was
to
give
an
important
luncheon
jack
minot
said
i
going
to
confide
in
you
i
going
to
tell
you
why
i
am
in
san
marco
unbare
your
secrets
paddock
answered
crossing
the
quiet
plaza
minot
explained
to
his
friend
the
matter
of
the
insurance
policy
written
by
the
romantic
jephson
in
new
york
he
told
of
how
he
had
come
south
with
the
promise
to
his
employer
that
miss
cynthia
meyrick
would
change
her
mind
only
over
his
dead
body
incredulous
exclamations
broke
from
the
flippant
paddock
as
he
listened
knowing
your
love
of
humor
minot
said
i
hasten
to
add
the
crowning
touch
the
moment
i
saw
cynthia
meyrick
i
realized
that
if
i
marry
her
myself
life
would
be
an
uninteresting
blank
forever
after
every
time
i
seen
her
since
i
been
surer
of
it
what
the
answer
jack
paddock
whistled
delicious
he
cried
pardon
me
i
speaking
as
a
rank
outsider
she
is
a
charming
girl
and
you
adore
her
bless
my
soul
how
the
plot
does
thicken
why
do
you
resign
you
idiot
my
first
idea
tried
it
and
it
would
work
besides
if
i
did
resign
i
could
stick
around
and
queer
jephson
chances
even
supposing
she
listen
to
my
pleading
which
she
would
children
see
the
very
christian
martyr
if
it
was
me
i
chuck
the
job
and
elope
with
oh
no
you
could
do
that
of
course
it
would
be
a
low
trick
you
are
in
a
hole
are
you
five
million
fathoms
deep
there
nothing
to
do
but
see
the
wedding
through
and
you
going
to
help
me
just
now
manuel
gonzale
has
a
packet
of
written
by
harrowby
in
his
salad
days
which
he
proposes
to
print
on
the
morrow
unless
he
is
paid
not
to
you
and
i
are
on
our
way
to
take
away
from
him
um
but
if
i
help
you
in
this
i
be
doing
you
a
mean
trick
quite
make
out
old
boy
whether
to
stand
by
you
in
a
business
or
a
personal
way
you
going
to
stand
by
me
in
a
business
way
i
want
you
along
to
lend
your
moral
support
while
i
throttle
that
little
ay
ay
sir
i
been
hearing
some
things
about
gonzale

go
to
it
they
groped
about
in
a
dark
hallway
hunting
the
office
shady
are
the
ways
of
journalism
commented
paddock
by
the
way
i
just
thought
of
one
for
bruce
to
spring
in
case
we
fail
and
the
affinity
letters
are
published
she
might
say
that
harrowby
epistles
got
into
the
once
too
often
it
only
a
rough
idea
ah
i
see
you
do
like
it
well
here
success
to
our
expedition
they
opened
the
door
of
the
office
sat
behind
a
desk
the
encyclopedia
before
him
seeking
lively
material
for
the
morrow
issue
howe
hammered
at
a
typewriter
both
of
the
newspaper
men
looked
up
at
the
intrusion

attire

ball

minot
but
our
wants

far
different

around
the
bush

some
letters

by
a
friend
of
mine
to
a
lady

the
moment

thousand
dollars

going
to
pay

little
blackmailers
blackmailers
eyes
seemed
to
catch
fire
from
his
hair
his
face
paled
i
been
in
the
newspaper
business
seventeen
years
and
nobody
ever
called
me
a
blackmailer
and
got
away
with
it
i
in
a
generous
mood
i
give
you
one
chance
to
take
that
back
nonsense
it
happens
to
be
true
put
in
paddock
i
talking
to
your
friend
here
breath
came
fast
attend
to
you
you
lily
of
the
field
in
a
minute
you
you
liar
are
you
going
to
take
that
back
no
cried
minot
he
saw
a
wild
irishman
coming
for
him
breathing
fire
he
squared
himself
to
meet
the
attack
but
the
man
at
the
typewriter
leaped
up
and
seized
from
behind
steady
bob
he
shouted
how
do
you
know
this
fellow
is
right
unaccountably
the
warlike
one
collapsed
into
a
chair
damn
it
i
know
he
right
he
groaned
that
what
makes
me
rave
why
did
you
let
me
punch
him
it
would
have
been
some
satisfaction
of
course
he
right
i
had
a
hunch
this
was
a
blackmailing
sheet
from
the
moment
my
hot
fingers
closed
on
gonzale
money
but
so
long
as
nobody
told
us
we
were
all
right
he
glared
angrily
at
minot
you
you
killjoy
he
cried
you
skeleton
at
the
feast
you
put
us
in
a
lovely
fix
well
i
sorry
said
minot
but
i
do
understand
these
heroics
it
all
up
now
harry
moaned
the
free
trial
is
over
and
we
got
to
send
the
mattress
back
to
the
factory
here
in
this
hollow
lotus
land
ever
to
live
and
lie
reclined
i
was
putting
welcome
on
the
mat
for
a
fate
like
that
back
to
the
road
for
us
that
human
fish
over
in
the
office

a
prophet

you
jobs

the
remember
cool

said
he
turned
to
minot
and
paddock
of
course
you
do
understand
you
see
we
strangers
here
drifted
in
last
night
broke
and
hungry
looking
for
jobs
we
got
them
under
rather
unusual
circumstances
things
looked
suspicious
the
proprietor
parted
with
money
without
screaming
for
help
and
no
regular
newspaper
is
run
like
that
but
when
you
down
and
out
you
know
i
understand
said
minot
smiling
and
i
sorry

called
you
what
i
did
i
apologize
and
i
hate
to
be
a
er
a
killjoy
but

is
a
blackmailer

us

will
he

prison
doing
ten
years
for

understand
that
gonzale
prefers
to
involve
his
editors
rather
than
himself
came
over
and
held
out
his
hand
to
minot
shake
son
he
said
thank

and
in
it
was
a
packet
of
perfumed

tied
with
a
cute
blue

he
released
his
victim

slowly
toward
his
employer
like
a

bird
did
you
get
my
emphasis
on
the
word
yet
gonzale
paled
beneath
his
lemon
skin
and

desk
now

pleaded

frank
with

that
moment

followed
by

rushing
triumphantly
into
the
harrowby
suite

threw
down
on
the
table
a
package
of

ran
down
several
flights
of
stairs
through
the
lobby
and
out
into
the
street
where
to
panted
paddock
the
harbor
minot
cried
as
they
passed
the
they
saw
a
crowd
forming
and
heard
the
buzz
of
many
voices
chapter
xiii
and
on
the
ships
at
sea
paddock
knew
of
a
man
on
the
who
had
a
gasoline
launch
to
rent
and
fortunately
it
happened
to
be
in
commission
the
two
young
men
leaped
into
it
paddock
started
the
engine
and
they
zipped
with
reassuring
speed
over
the
dark
waters
toward
the
lights
of
the

of
the

down
and
leaving
a
member
of
the
crew
to
make
fast

climbed
hurriedly
to
the
deck
martin
wall
was
at
the
moment
in
the
main
cabin
engaged
in
a
game
of
german
whist
and
his
opponent
was
no
less
a
person
than
george
harrowby
of
the
peerage
upon
this
quiet
game
the
two
young
men
rushed
in
unexpected
visitors
said
wall
why
what
the
matter
boys
come
out
on
deck
a
minute
said
minot
rapidly
wall
threw
down
his
cards
and
followed
once
outside
minot
went
on
no
time
to
waste
words
trimmer
is
collecting
a
mob
in
front
of
the
and
they
are
coming
out
here
to
search
this
boat
you
know
who
looking
for
with
exaggerated
calmness
wall
took
out
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
indeed
he
remarked
i
told
you
it
might
be
advisable
to
look
up
the
penalty
for
kidnaping
but
you
knew
best
ah
the
impetuosity
of
youth
well
this
is
no
time
to
discuss
that
replied
minot
we
got
to
act
and
act
quickly
yes
wall
drawled
what
would
you
suggest
shall
we
drown
him
i
come
to
like
george
mighty
well
but
if
you
say
the
word
my
plan
is
this
said
minot
annoyed
by
wall
pleasantries
turn
george
over
to
us
we
bundle
him
into
our
launch
and
run
off
out
of
sight
behind
tarragona
island
then
let
trimmer
search
to
his
content
when
he
gets
tired
and
quits
signal
us
by
hanging
a
red
lantern
in
the
bow
martin
wall
smiled
broadly
not
bad
for
an
amateur
kidnaper
he
said
will
i
turn
george
over
to
you
will
a
duck
swim
a
good
idea
for
god
sake
hurry
cried
minot
look
he
pointed
to
the
largest
of
san
marco
piers
the
moon
was
lost
under
clouds
now
but
the
electric
lights
on
the
revealed
a
swarming
shouting
crowd
of
people
martin
wall
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
main
cabin
lord
harrowby
he
cried
he
turned
to
minot
and
paddock
i
call
him
that
to
cheer
him
in
captivity
he
explained
the
tall
weary
englishman
strode
out
upon
the
deck
lord
harrowby
said
wall
these
two
gentlemen
have
come
to
take
you
for
a
boat
ride
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
step
into
that
launch
poor
old
george
pulled
himself
together
if
you
pardon
my
language
i
be
damned
if
i
do
he
said
i
take
it
mr
trimmer
is
on
his
way
here
well
gentlemen
the
first
to
grasp
his
hand
when
he
boards
the
boat
will
be
the
chap
who
now
addresses
you
they
stood
gazing
doubtfully
at
george
in
revolt
then
minot
turned
and
saw
a
rowboat
putting
off
from
the
pier
come
on
he
cried
and
leaped
on
the
shoulders
of
the
aspirant
to
the
title
paddock
and
wall
followed
despite
his
discouraged
appearance
george
put
up
a
lively
fight
for
a
time
the
four
men
struggled
back
and
forth
across
the
deck
now
in
moonlight
now
in
shadow
once
george
slipped
and
fell
his
three
captors
on
top
of
him
and
at
that
moment
minot
felt
a
terrific
tugging
at
his
coat
but
the
odds
were
three
to
one
against
george
harrowby
and
finally
he
was
dragged
and
pushed
into
the
launch
again
paddock
started
the
engine
and
that
odd
boat
load
drew
away
from
the
they
had
gone
about
ten
feet
when
poor
old
george
slipped
out
from
under
minot
and
leaped
to
his
feet
hi
trimmer
it
me
it
george
he
thundered
in
a
startlingly
loud
tone
minot
put
his
hand
over
george
lips
and
they
locked
in
conflict
the
small
launch
danced
wildly
on
the
waters
and
fortunately
for
minot
plans
the
moon
still
hid
behind
the
clouds
with
a
stretch
of
tarragona
rank
vegetation
between
them
and
the
paddock
stopped
the
engine
and
they
stood
still
on
the
dark
waters
paddock
lighted
a
cigarette
utilizing
the
same
match
to
consult
his
watch
ten
he
said
ca
say
this
is
the
jolliest
little
party
i
was
ever
on
never
mind
replied
minot
cheerfully
it
wo
take
trimmer
fifteen
minutes
to
find
that
his
proposition
is
on
board
in
twenty
minutes
we
slip
back
and
look
for
the
signal
the
proposition
in
question
sat
up
and
straightened
his
collar
the
pater
and
i
split
he
said
over
the
matter
of
my
going
to
oxford
the
old
boy
knew
best
i
wish
now
i
gone
then
i
might
have
words
to
tell
you
chaps
what
i
think
of
this
damnable
outrage
minot
and
paddock
sat
in
silence
i
been
in
america
twenty
odd
years
the
proposition
went
on
seen
all
sorts
of
injustice
and
wrong
but
i
lived
to
experience
the
climax
myself
still
silence
from
his
captors
while
the
black
waters
swished
about
the
launch
i
take
it
you
chaps
believe
me
to
be
an
impostor
just
as
allan
does
well
i
not
and
i
going
to
give
you
my
little
talk
on
the
old
days
at
rakedale
hall
when
i
finished
no
you
not
said
minot
i
heard
all
that
once
and
you
were
convinced
why
everybody
in
san
marco
is
convinced
the
mayor
the
chief
of
police
the
my
dear
george
said
minot
with
feeling
it
does
make
the
slightest
difference
who
you
are
you
and
trimmer
stay
separated
until
after
next
tuesday
yes
and
rank
injustice
it
is
too
we
have
the
law
on
you
for
this
we
send
you
all
to
prison
pleasant
thought
commented
paddock
bruce
would
have
to
develop
lockjaw
at
the
height
of
the
social
season
oh
the
devil
better
be
thinking
about
that
luncheon
all
thought
all
sat
there
silent
the
black
waters
became
a
little
rougher
on
their
surface
small
flecks
of
white
began
to
appear
minot
looked
up
at
the
dark
sky
after
said
paddock
finally
and
turned
toward
the
engine
heaven
grant
that
red
light
is
on
view
this
is
getting
on
my
nerves
slyly
the
little
launch
poked
its
nose
around
the
corner
of
the
island
and
peeped
at
the
majestic
paddock
snorted
not
a
trace
of
it
i
must
have
underestimated
the
time
said
minot
wha
what
that
that
that
only
thunder
oh
this
is
going
to
be
a
pretty
party
suddenly
the
heavens
blazed
with
lightning
the
swell
of
the
waters
increased
hastily
paddock
backed
the
boat
from
the
range
of
the
vision
trimmer
must
go
soon
cried
minot
fifteen
minutes
passed
in
eloquent
silence
the
lightning
and
the
thunder
continued
try
it
again
minot
suggested
again
they
peeped
and
still
no
red
light
on
the
and
even
as
they
looked
out
of
the
black
heavens
swept
a
sheet
of
stinging
rain
it
lashed
down
on
that
frail
tossing
boat
with
cruel
force
it
obscured
the
the
island
everything
but
the
fact
of
its
own
damp
existence
in
two
seconds
the
men
unprotected
in
that
tiny
launch
were
pitiful
dripping
figures
and
the
glory
of
paddock
evening
clothes
departed
never
to
return
a
in
albuquerque
said
poor
old
george
told
me
i
was
to
die
of
pneumonia
it
be
murder
gentlemen
plain
murder
it
suicide
too
is
it
snarled
paddock
that
ought
to
satisfy
you
i
sorry
said
minot
through
chattering
teeth
no
answer
the
downfall
continued
the
rain
is
raining
everywhere
quoted
paddock
gloomily
it
falls
on
the
umbrellas
here
and
on
the
ships
at
sea
damn
the
ships
at
sea
here
here
said
poor
old
george
a
damp
doleful
pause
greater
love
hath
no
man
than
this
that
he
lay
down
his
life
for
a
friend
continued
paddock
presently
a
thousand
apologies
minot
said
but
i
running
the
same
chances
jack
yes
but
it
your
party
your
happy
little
party
replied
paddock
not
mine
minot
did
not
answer
he
was
as
miserable
as
the
others
and
he
could
scarcely
blame
his
friend
for
losing
temporarily
his
good
nature
it
after
eleven
said
paddock
after
another
long
pause
put
in
closer
to
the
suggested
minot
paddock
fumbled
about
beneath
the
canvas
cover
of
the
engine
and
they
put
in
but
still
no
red
light
aboard
the
yacht
i
give
a
thousand
dollars
said
paddock
to
know
what
going
on
aboard
that
boat
the
knowledge
would
hardly
have
been
worth
the
price
he
offered
aboard
the
on
the
forward
deck
under
a
protecting
awning
mr
trimmer
sat
firmly
planted
in
a
chair
beside
him
in
other
chairs
sat
three
prominent
citizens
of
san
marco
one
of
them
the
chief
of
police
martin
wall
was
madly
walking
the
deck
near
by
going
to
stay
here
all
night
he
demanded
at
last
all
night
and
all
day
replied
mr
trimmer
if
necessary
we
going
to
stay
here
until
that
boat
that
carrying
lord
harrowby
comes
back
you
ca
fool
henry
trimmer
there
is
any
such
boat
flared
martin
wall
tell
it
to
the
marines
remarked
trimmer
lighting
a
fresh
cigar
just
as
well
that
the
three
shivering
figures
huddled
in
the
launch
on
the
heaving
bosom
of
the
waters
could
not
see
this
picture
wall
looked
out
at
the
rain
and
shivered
himself
came
and
twelve
two
matches
from
paddock
store
went
to
the
discovery
of
these
sad
facts
soaked
to
the
skin
glum
silent
the
three
on
the
waters
sat
staring
at
the
unresponsive
the
rain
was
falling
now
in
a
fine
drizzle
i
suppose
paddock
remarked
we
stay
here
until
morning
we
might
try
landing
on
tarragona
said
minot
we
might
try
jumping
into
the
ocean
too
responded
paddock
through
chattering
teeth
murder
droned
poor
old
george
that
what
it
be
at
one
the
three
wet
watchers
beheld
unusual
things
smoke
began
to
belch
from
the
funnels
her
siren
sounded
she
steaming
out
cried
minot
she
steaming
out
to
sea
and
sure
enough
the
graceful
yacht
began
to
move
out
past
tarragona
island
out
toward
the
open
sea
once
more
paddock
started
his
faithful
engine
and
hallooing
madly
the
three
set
out
in
pursuit
not
yet
had
the
struck
its
gait
and
in
fifteen
minutes
they
were
alongside
martin
wall
beholding
them
from
the
deck
had
a
rather
unexpected
attack
of
pity
and
stopped
his
engines
the
three
limp
watchers
were
taken
aboard
wha
what
does
this
mean
chattered
minot
you
poor
devils
said
martin
wall
come
and
have
a
drink
mean
he
poured
it
means
that
the
only
way
i
could
get
rid
of
our
friend
trimmer
was
to
set
out
for
new
york
for
new
york
cried
minot
standing
glass
in
hand
yes
came
on
board
trimmer
did
searched
the
boat
and
then
declared
i
shipped
george
away
until
his
visit
should
be
over
so
he
and
his
friends
one
of
them
the
chief
of
police
by
the
way
sat
down
to
wait
for
your
return
gad
i
thought
of
you
out
in
that
rain
sat
and
sat
and
sat
what
could
i
do
to
trimmer
the
brute
said
paddock
raising
his
glass
finally
i
had
an
idea
i
had
the
boys
pull
up
anchor
and
start
the
engines
trimmer
wanted
to
know
the
answer
for
new
york
i
said
to
come
along
he
was
sure
whether
he
would
go
or
not
but
his
friends
were
sure
they
would
put
up
an
awful
howl
and
just
before
we
got
under
way
mr
trimmer
and
party
crawled
into
their
rowboat
and
splashed
back
to
san
marco
well
what
now
asked
minot
i
made
up
my
mind
said
wall
been
intending
to
go
back
north
for
some
time
and
now
that
i
started
i
guess
i
keep
on
going
splendid
cried
minot
and
you
take
george
harrowby
with
you
wall
seemed
in
excellent
spirits
he
slapped
minot
on
the
back
if
you
say
so
of
course
do
know
exactly
what
they
can
do
to
us
but
i
think
george
needs
the
sea
air
how
about
it
your
lordship
poor
old
george
drooping
as
he
had
never
drooped
before
looked
wearily
into
wall
eyes
what
the
use
he
said
fight
all
gone
out
of
me
losing
interest
in
what
next
three
hours
on
that
blooming
ocean
with
the
rain
soaking
in
i
going
to
bed
i
do
care
what
becomes
of
me
and
he
sloshed
away
to
his
cabin
well
boys
i
afraid
we
have
to
put
you
off
said
martin
wall
glad
to
have
met
both
of
you
sometime
in
new
york
we
may
run
into
each
other
again
he
shook
hands
genially
and
the
two
young
men
dropped
once
more
into
that
unhappy
launch
as
they
sped
toward
the
shore
the
behind
them
was
heading
for
the
open
sea
sorry
if
i
seemed
to
have
a
grouch
said
paddock
as
they
walked
up
the
deserted
avenue
toward
the
hotel
but
these
florida
are
the
pleasantest
things
to
wear
next
to
one
skin
i
apologize
dick
nonsense
minot
answered
old
job
himself
would
have
frowned
a
bit
if
he
been
through
what
you
have
it
was
my
fault
for
getting
you
into
it
forget
it
paddock
said
well
it
looks
like
a
wedding
old
man
the
letters
home
again
and
george
harrowby
headed
for
new
york
a
three
days
trip
nothing
to
hinder
now
have
you
thought
of
that
i
do
want
to
think
said
minot
gloomily
good
night
old
man
paddock
sped
up
the
stairs
to
his
room
which
was
on
the
second
floor
and
minot
turned
toward
the
elevator
at
that
moment
he
saw
approaching
him
through
the
deserted
lobby
jim
the
house
detective
of
the
de
la
pax
can
we
see
you
a
minute
in
the
office
mr
minot
he
asked
certainly
minot
answered
but
i
soaked
through
was
out
in
all
that
rain
too
bad
said
with
a
sympathetic
glance
we
wo
keep
you
but
a
minute
he
led
the
way
and
wondering
minot
followed
in
the
tiny
office
of
the
hotel
manager
a
man
stood
waiting
my
friend
huntley
of
the
secret
service
explained
awful
sorry
that
this
should
happen
minot
but
we
got
to
search
you
search
me
for
what
minot
cried
and
in
a
flash
he
knew
through
that
wild
night
he
had
not
once
thought
of
it
but
it
was
still
in
his
inside
coat
pocket
of
course
chain
lightning
collar
what
does
this
mean
he
asked
that
what
they
all
say
grunted
huntley
come
here
my
boy
say
you
pretty
wet
and
shivering
better
have
a
warm
bath
and
a
drink
turn
around
please
ah
with
practised
fingers
the
detective
explored
rapidly
person
and
pockets
the
victim
of
the
search
stood
limp
helpless
what
could
he
do
there
was
no
escape
it
was
all
up
now
for
whatever
reason
they
desired
chain
lightning
collar
they
could
not
fail
to
have
it
in
another
minute
side
pockets
trousers
pockets
now
the
inner
coat
pocket
its
contents
were
in
the
detective
hand
minot
stared
down
a
little
gasp
escaped
him
the
envelope
that
held
chain
lightning
collar
was
not
among
them
two
minutes
longer
huntley
pursued
then
with
an
oath
of
disappointment
he
turned
to
has
got
it
he
announced
minot
swept
aside
the
profuse
apologies
of
the
hotel
detective
and
somehow
got
out
of
the
room
in
a
daze
he
sought
he
did
have
it
did
have
chain
lightning
collar
who
did
it
was
while
he
sat
steaming
in
a
hot
bath
that
an
idea
came
to
him
the
struggle
on
the
deck
of
the
with
martin
wall
panting
at
his
side
the
tug
on
his
coat
as
they
all
went
down
together
the
genial
spirits
of
wall
thereafter
the
sudden
start
for
new
york
no
question
about
it
chain
lightning
collar
was
well
out
at
sea
now
and
yet
why
had
wall
stopped
to
take
the
occupants
of
the
launch
aboard
after
his
bath
minot
donned
pajamas
and
a
and
ventured
out
to
find
lord
harrowby
suite
with
difficulty
he
succeeded
in
arousing
the
sleeping
peer
harrowby
let
him
in
and
then
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
stared
at
him
what
is
it
he
inquired
sleepily
briefly
minot
told
him
of
the
circumstances
preceding
the
start
of
the
for
new
york
of
his
return
to
the
hotel
and
the
search
party
he
encountered
there
harrowby
was
very
wide
awake
by
this
time
that
finishes
us
he
groaned
wait
a
minute
minot
said
they
did
find
the
necklace
i
have
it
i
lost
it
lost
it
yes
and
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
think
martin
wall
stole
it
from
me
on
the
and
is
now
on
his
way
harrowby
leaped
from
bed
and
seized
minot
gleefully
by
the
hand
dear
old
chap
what
the
deuce
do
i
care
who
took
it
it
gone
thank
god
it
gone
but
i
do
understand
no
but
you
can
understand
this
much
everything
all
right
nothing
in
the
way
of
the
wedding
now
it
splendid
splendid
but
the
necklace
was
stolen
yes
good
very
good
my
dear
minot
the
luckiest
thing
that
can
happen
to
us
will
be
never
never
to
see
chain
lightning
collar
again
as
completely
at
sea
as
he
had
been
that
night
which
was
more
or
less
at
sea
minot
returned
to
his
room
it
was
after
three
he
turned
out
his
lights
and
sought
his
bed
many
wild
conjectures
kept
him
awake
at
first
but
this
had
been
the
busiest
day
of
his
life
soon
he
slept
and
dreamed
thrilling
dreams
the
sun
was
bright
outside
his
windows
when
he
was
aroused
by
a
knock
what
is
it
he
cried
a
package
for
you
sir
said
a
voice
he
slipped
one
arm
outside
his
door
to
receive
it
a
neat
little
bundle
securely
tied
with
his
name
written
on
the
wrappings
sleepily
he
undid
the
cord
and
took
out
an
envelope
he
was
no
longer
sleepy
he
held
the
envelope
open
over
his
bed
chain
lightning
collar
tumbled
gleaming
upon
the
white
sheet
also
in
the
package
was
a
note
which
minot
read
breathlessly
dear
minot
i
have
decided
not
to
go
north
after
all
and
am
back
in
the
harbor
with
the
as
i
expect
trimmer
at
any
moment
i
have
sent
george
over
to
tarragona
island
in
charge
of
two
sailormen
for
the
day
cordially
martin
wall
you
dropped
the
enclosed
in
the
scuffle
on
the
boat
last
night
chapter
xiv
jersey
city
interferes
at
ten
that
saturday
morning
lord
harrowby
was
engrossed
in
the
ceremony
of
breakfast
in
his
rooms
for
the
occasion
he
wore
an
orange
and
purple
with
a
floral
design
no
botanist
could
have
sanctioned
the
sort
of
that
arnold
bennett
had
he
seen
it
would
have
made
a
leading
character
in
a
novel
he
was
cheerful
was
harrowby
and
as
he
glanced
through
an
old
copy
of
the
he
made
strange
noises
in
his
throat
under
the
impression
that
he
was
humming
a
musical
comedy
chorus
there
was
a
knock
and
harrowby
cried
come
in
minot
fresh
as
the
morning
and
nowhere
near
so
hot
entered
feeling
pretty
satisfied
with
life
i
wager
minot
suggested
my
dear
chap
gay
as
as
a
robin
harrowby
replied
snatch
your
last
giggle
said
minot
have
one
final
laugh
and
make
it
a
good
one
then
wake
up
wake
up
why
i
am
awake
oh
no
you
dreaming
on
a
bed
of
roses
listen
martin
wall
did
go
north
with
the
impostor
after
all
changed
his
mind
look
and
minot
tossed
something
on
the
table
just
abaft
his
lordship
eggs
the
devil
chain
lightning
collar
cried
harrowby
back
to
its
original
storage
vault
said
minot
what
is
this
harrowby
a
drury
lane
melodrama
my
word
i
ca
make
it
out
ca
you
got
the
necklace
back
this
morning
with
a
note
from
martin
wall
saying
i
dropped
it
last
night
in
the
scrap
on
the
deck
of
the
confound
the
thing
sighed
harrowby
staring
morosely
at
the
diamonds
my
first
impulse
said
minot
is
to
hand
the
necklace
back
to
you
and
gracefully
withdraw
but
of
course
i
here
to
look
after
jephson
interests
naturally
put
in
harrowby
quickly
and
let
me
tell
you
that
should
this
necklace
be
found
before
the
wedding
jephson
is
practically
certain
to
pay
that
policy
i
think
you
better
keep
it
they
not
likely
to
search
you
again
if
i
took
it
dear
old
chap
they
search
me
every
little
while
you
did
steal
this
did
you
minot
asked
of
course
not
harrowby
flushed
a
delicate
pink
it
belongs
in
our
family
has
for
years
everybody
knows
that
well
what
is
the
trouble
i
explain
it
all
later
there
really
nothing
dishonorable
as
men
of
the
world
look
at
such
things
i
give
you
my
word
that
you
can
serve
jephson
best
by
keeping
the
necklace
for
the
present
and
seeing
to
it
that
it
does
not
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
men
who
are
looking
for
it
minot
sat
staring
gloomily
ahead
of
him
then
he
reached
out
took
up
the
necklace
and
restored
it
to
his
pocket
oh
very
well
he
said
if
i
sent
to
jail
tell
thacker
i
went
singing
an
epithalamium
he
rose
by
the
way
harrowby
remarked
i
giving
a
little
dinner
at
the
manhattan
club
may
i
count
on
you
surely
minot
smiled
i
be
there
wearing
our
necklace
my
dear
fellow
ah
i
see
you
mean
it
pleasantly
wear
it
by
all
means
minot
passed
from
the
eccentric
blooms
of
that
to
the
more
authentic
flowers
of
the
florida
outdoors
in
the
plaza
he
met
cynthia
meyrick
rival
candidate
to
the
morning
in
its
glory
matrimony
she
said
is
more
trouble
than
it
seems
on
a
moonlit
night
under
the
palms
i
never
been
so
busy
in
my
life
by
the
way
two
of
my
bridesmaids
arrived
from
new
york
last
night
lovely
girls
both
of
them
but
i
forget
forget
what
your
young
heart
is
already
ensnared
is
it
yes
replied
minot
fervently
it
is
but
no
matter
tell
me
about
your
preparations
for
the
wedding
i
should
like
to
enjoy
the
thrill
of
it
by
proxy
how
like
a
man
wants
all
the
thrill
and
none
of
the
bother
dreadfully
hard
staging
a
wedding
way
down
here
a
thousand
miles
from
everything
but
my
gown
came
last
night
from
paris
can
you
imagine
the
thrill
of
that
only
faintly
how
stupid
being
a
man
must
be
and
how
glorious
being
a
girl
with
man
only
an
afterthought
even
at
wedding
time
poor
harrowby
he
keeps
in
the
fairly
well
however
they
walked
along
a
moment
in
silence
i
wondered
she
said
at
length
why
you
kidnap
mr
trimmer
friend
because
yes
eagerly
minot
looked
at
her
and
something
rose
in
his
throat
to
choke
him
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
it
is
the
fault
of
the
master
of
the
show
i
only
the
pawn
the
baffled
raging
unhappy
little
pawn
that
all
i
can
tell
you
you
you
were
speaking
of
your
wedding
gown
a
present
from
aunt
mary
she
answered
a
strange
tenderness
in
her
tone
for
a
good
little
girl
who
caught
a
lord
a
charming
little
girl
said
minot
softly
may
i
say
that
yes
her
brown
eyes
glowed
i
glad
to
have
you
say
it
i
go
in
here
mr
kidnaper
she
disappeared
into
a
shop
and
minot
walked
slowly
down
the
street
girls
from
peoria
and
paris
from
boise
city
and
london
passed
by
girls
chaperoned
and
girls
alone
tourist
girls
in
swarms
and
not
a
few
of
them
wondered
why
such
a
young
man
should
appear
to
be
so
sorry
for
himself
returning
to
the
hotel
at
noon
minot
met
martin
wall
on
the
veranda
lucky
i
put
old
george
on
tarragona
for
the
day
wall
confided
as
i
expected
trimmer
was
out
to
call
early
this
morning
searched
the
ship
from
stem
to
stern
i
rather
think
we
have
mr
trimmer
up
a
tree
he
went
away
not
quite
so
sure
of
himself
good
minot
answered
so
you
changed
your
mind
about
going
north
yes
think
i
stay
over
for
the
wedding
by
the
way
was
that
chain
lightning
collar
you
left
behind
you
last
night
y
yes
thought
so
you
ought
to
be
more
careful
people
might
suspect
you
of
being
the
thief
at
mrs
bruce
if
you
think
that
i
wish
you
speak
to
his
lordship
i
have
your
innocence
is
established
and
i
promised
harrowby
to
keep
his
little
mystery
dark
you
very
kind
said
minot
and
went
on
into
the
hotel
the
remainder
of
the
day
passed
lazily
dick
minot
felt
lost
indeed
for
seemingly
there
were
no
more
doughty
deeds
to
be
done
in
the
name
of
jephson
the
gaiety
lady
was
gone
her
letters
were
in
the
hands
of
the
man
who
had
written
them
the
claimant
to
the
title
languished
among
the
alligators
of
tarragona
a
prisoner
trimmer
appeared
to
be
baffled
bridesmaids
arrived
the
wedding
gown
appeared
it
looked
like
smooth
sailing
now
jack
paddock
met
for
a
moment
late
in
the
afternoon
announced
airily
by
the
way
the
duke
and
duchess
of
lismore
have
come
you
know
the
sausage
lady
and
her
captive
my
word
you
should
see
her
a
wardrobe
to
draw
tears
of
envy
from
a
theatrical
star
fifty
costly
necklaces
and
only
one
neck
tragic
smiled
minot
funny
thing
happened
paddock
whispered
i
met
the
duchess
once
abroad
she
sent
for
me
this
noon
and
almost
bowled
me
over
seems
she
heard
of
bruce
as
the
wittiest
woman
in
san
marco
and
she
jealous
a
clever
boy
says
her
ladyship
to
me
me
up
so
i
can
outshine
mrs
bruce
what
do
you
know
ah
but
you
were
the
pioneer
minot
reminded
him
well
i
was
for
that
matter
said
paddock
but
i
know
now
it
was
a
clever
idea
if
this
woman
can
think
of
it
too
what
did
you
tell
her
i
was
shocked
i
showed
it
it
seemed
deception
to
me
still
she
made
me
an
offer
that
well
i
told
her
i
think
it
over
good
heavens
jack
you
would
try
to
sell
both
dialogue
why
not
play
one
against
the
other
make
keener
for
my
goods
i
got
a
notion
to
clean
up
here
quick
and
then
go
back
to
the
real
stuff
that
little
girl
from
the
middle
west
i
forgot
all
about
her
of
course
but
speaking
of
cleaning
up
i
thinking
of
it
dick
my
boy
yes
i
believe
i
take
them
both
on
secretly
of
course
it
means
hard
work
for
me
but
when
one
loves
one
art
no
service
seems
too
tough
you
hopeless
minot
groaned
say
not
so
laughed
paddock
and
went
away
humming
a
frivolous
tune
at
a
quarter
before
seven
for
the
first
time
minot
entered
tom
stacy
manhattan
club
and
grill
to
any
one
who
crossed
threshold
with
the
expectation
of
immediately
encountering
lights
and
gaiety
the
first
view
of
the
interior
came
as
a
distinct
shock
the
main
of
the
manhattan
club
was
dim
with
the
holy
dimness
of
a
cathedral
its
lamps
hung
high
were
buried
in
oriental
trappings
and
shone
faintly
through
the
gloom
could
be
discerned
white
gleaming
silver
the
scene
demanded
hushed
voices
noiseless
footsteps
it
got
both
the
main
was
hollowed
out
of
the
center
of
the
great
stone
building
and
its
roof
was
off
in
the
dark
three
stories
above
on
each
side
of
the
entrance
stairways
led
to
second
and
balconies
which
stretched
around
the
room
on
three
sides
from
these
balconies
doors
opened
into
innumerable
rooms
rooms
where
lights
shone
brighter
and
from
which
the
chief
of
police
when
he
came
to
make
certain
financial
arrangements
with
stacy
heard
frequently
a
gentle
it
may
have
been
that
the
furnishings
of
the
main
and
the
balconies
were
there
before
stacy
coming
or
again
they
may
have
set
forth
his
own
idea
of
suitable
decoration
looking
about
him
minot
was
reminded
of
a
play
like
after
three
hard
seasons
on
the
road
rugs
and
musty
tapestries
hung
everywhere
here
and
there
an
atrocious
cozy
corner
belied
its
name
iron
lanterns
gave
parsimonious
light
aged
lay
limply
oriental
stacy
would
have
called
the
effect
here
in
this
dim
but
scarcely
religious
light
the
patrons
of
his
grill
ate
their
food
being
not
without
misgivings
as
they
stared
through
the
gloom
at
their
plates
the
long
tables
for
the
harrowby
dinner
were
already
set
and
about
them
hovered
waiters
of
a
color
to
match
the
room
most
of
the
guests
had
arrived
paddock
made
it
a
point
to
introduce
minot
at
once
to
the
duchess
of
lismore
this
noble
lady
with
the
past
was
making
a
commendable
effort
to
lighten
the
manhattan
club
by
a
wonderful
display
of
jewels
then
felt
i
like
some
watcher
of
the
skies
when
a
new
planet
swims
into
his
ken
whispered
minot
as
the
duchess
moved
away
paddock
laughed
a
dowdy
little
woman
by
day
but
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
he
agreed
by
the
way
i
foreman
of
her
beginning
be
careful
jack
minot
warned
a
double
life
from
now
on
paddock
replied
but
i
think
i
can
get
away
with
it
say
for
ways
that
are
dark
this
man
stacy
seems
to
hold
a
better
hand
than
the
heathen
chinee
in
one
corner
the
portly
spencer
meyrick
was
orating
to
a
circle
of
young
people
on
the
evils
of
gambling
minot
turned
away
smiling
cynically
meyrick
as
everybody
knew
had
made
a
large
part
of
his
fortune
in
wall
street
the
dinner
was
much
larger
than
bruce
minot
met
a
number
of
new
people
the
anemic
husband
of
the
jewels
smug
in
his
dukedom
and
several
very
attractive
girls
thrilled
at
being
present
in
sinful
lair
he
bestowed
a
smile
upon
aunt
mary
serene
among
the
best
people
and
discussed
with
bruce
who
wasted
no
boughten
wit
on
him
the
florida
climate
also
he
asked
the
elder
of
the
omaha
girls
if
she
had
heard
of
nat
goodwin
latest
wife
for
once
the
dinner
itself
was
a
minor
event
it
sped
rapidly
there
in
the
gloom
and
few
so
much
as
listened
to
the
flashes
of
wit
save
perhaps
the
duchess
enviously
it
was
after
the
dinner
when
harrowby
led
his
guests
to
the
entertainment
above
that
interest
grew
tense
no
gloom
in
that
bright
room
overhead
a
cluster
of
electric
lights
shed
their
brilliance
on
stacy
pet
roulette
tables
set
amid
parlor
furnishings
of
atrocious
plush
from
one
corner
a
faro
that
had
once
flourished
on
street
new
york
beckoned
and
on
each
side
through
open
doors
might
be
seen
rooms
furnished
for
the
game
of
poker
stacy
assistant
a
polished
gentleman
with
a
face
like
aged
ivory
presided
over
the
roulette
table
he
swung
the
wheel
a
few
times
an
inviting
smile
on
his
face
harrowby
his
eyes
bright
laid
a
sum
of
money
beside
a
row
of
innocent
figures
he
won
he
tried
again
and
won
some
of
the
young
women
pushed
close
to
the
table
visibly
affected
others
pretended
this
sort
of
thing
was
an
old
story
to
them
a
few
of
the
more
adventurous
women
borrowed
coins
from
the
men
and
joined
in
the
play
arguments
and
misunderstandings
arose
which
stacy
assistant
urbanely
settled
more
of
the
men
paddock
among
them
laid
money
on
the
table
a
buzz
of
excited
conversation
punctuated
now
and
then
by
a
deathly
silence
as
the
wheel
spun
and
the
little
ball
hovered
filled
the
room
cheeks
glowed
red
eyes
sparkled
the
crush
about
the
table
increased
spencer
meyrick
himself
risked
from
his
endless
store
tom
stacy
place
was
in
full
swing
dick
minot
caught
cynthia
meyrick
glance
as
she
stood
close
beside
lord
harrowby
she
seemed
another
girl
grave
rather
than
gay
her
great
brown
eyes
apparently
looking
into
the
future
wondering
fearing
as
for
harrowby
he
was
a
man
transformed
not
for
nothing
was
he
the
son
of
the
sporting
earl
of
raybrook
the
peer
who
never
failed
to
take
a
risk
the
excitement
of
the
game
was
reflected
in
his
tall
tense
figure
his
flaming
cheeks
this
was
the
harrowby
who
had
made
jephson
that
gambling
proposition
on
a
seventeenth
floor
in
new
york
and
harrowby
won
consistently
won
until
a
fatal
choice
of
numbers
with
an
overwhelming
stake
left
him
poor
again
and
he
saw
all
his
winnings
swept
to
swell
tom
stacy
store
quickly
he
wormed
his
way
out
of
the
crowd
and
sought
minot
may
i
see
you
a
moment
he
asked
out
here
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
gloom
of
the
balcony
if
i
only
had
the
cash
harrowby
whispered
excitedly
i
could
break
stacy
and
i
going
to
get
it
will
you
give
me
the
necklace
please
you
forget
minot
objected
that
the
necklace
is
supposed
to
have
been
stolen
no
no
that
no
matter
i
arrange
that
hurry
you
forget
too
that
you
told
me
this
morning
that
should
this
necklace
be
found
now
minot
the
necklace
belongs
to
me
will
you
kindly
let
me
have
it
certainly
said
minot
coldly
and
much
annoyed
he
returned
to
the
room
amid
the
buzz
and
the
thrill
of
gambling
harrowby
ran
quickly
down
the
stairs
in
the
office
of
the
club
he
found
tom
stacy
in
amiable
converse
with
martin
wall
he
threw
chain
lightning
collar
on
the
manager
desk
how
much
can
you
loan
me
on
that
he
demanded
with
a
grunt
of
surprise
stacy
took
up
the
famous
collar
in
his
thick
fingers
he
gazed
at
it
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
up
and
caught
martin
wall
crafty
eye
over
harrowby
shoulder
not
a
cent
said
stacy
firmly
what
i
do
understand
harrowby
gazed
at
him
blankly
worth
not
a
cent
stacy
repeated
that
final
harrowby
turned
appealingly
to
martin
wall
you
he
pleaded
i
not
investing
wall
replied
with
a
queer
smile
lord
harrowby
restored
the
necklace
to
his
pocket
and
crestfallen
gloomy
went
back
to
the
room
above
would
loan
me
anything
on
it
he
whispered
to
minot
i
understand
really
thereafter
harrowby
suffered
the
pain
of
watching
others
play
and
while
he
watched
in
the
little
office
a
scene
of
vital
bearing
on
his
future
was
enacted
a
short
stocky
man
with
a
head
had
pushed
open
the
door
on
stacy
and
wall
he
stood
looking
about
him
with
a
cynical
smile
hello
tom
he
said
old
bill
huntley
cried
stacy
by
gad
you
gave
me
a
turn
i
forgot
for
a
minute
that

ca
raid
me
down
here

huntley
dryly
i

to
have
some
gay
times
in

ai

pretending
admiration

the
swell

faster

a
favor
if
you
promise
not
to

well
what
is

down
here
looking
for
a
diamond
necklace
known
as
chain
lightning
collar
great
little
guesser
you
are
well
what

promise
you

goods
and
i
see
all
right
you

that
necklace
in
lord
harrowby
pocket
right
now
and
you
find
lord
harrowby
in
a
room
huntley
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
man
he
called
craig
then
with
a
grunt
he
turned
away
two
minutes
later
in
the
bright
room
above
that
same
rather
vulgar
grunt
sounded
in
lord
harrowby
patrician
ear
he
turned
and
his
face
paled
hopelessly
he
looked
toward
minot
then
without
a
word
he
followed
huntley
from
the
room
only
two
of
that
excited
crowd
about
the
wheel
noticed
and
these
two
fled
simultaneously
to
the
balcony
there
half
hidden
behind
an
ancient
musty
rug
cynthia
meyrick
and
minot
watched
together
harrowby
and
huntley
descended
the
soft
stairs
at
the
bottom
martin
wall
and
stacy
were
waiting
the
sound
of
voices
pitched
low
could
be
heard
on
the
balcony
but
though
they
strained
to
hear
the
pair
above
could
not
however
they
could
see
the
plebeian
hand
of
huntley
held
out
to
lord
harrowby
they
could
see
harrowby
reach
into
his
pocket
and
bring
forth
a
white
envelope
next
they
beheld
chain
lightning
collar
gleam
in
the
dusk
as
huntley
held
it
up
a
few
low
words
and
harrowby
went
out
with
the
detective
martin
wall
ascended
the
stair
on
the
dim
balcony
he
was
confronted
by
a
girl
whose
wonderful
copper
hair
had
once
held
chain
lightning
collar
what
does
it
mean
she
asked
her
voice
low
and
tense
mean
martin
wall
laughed
it
means
that
lord
harrowby
must
go
north
and
face
a
united
states
commissioner
in
jersey
city
it
seems
that
when
he
brought
that
necklace
over
he
quite
forgot
to
tell
the
customs
officials
about
it
go
north
when
on
the
midnight
train
north
to
jersey
city
wall
went
into
the
bright
room
where
the
excitement
buzzed
on
oblivious
cynthia
meyrick
turned
to
minot
but
he
ca
possibly
get
back
she
cried
no
he
ca
get
back
i
sorry
and
my
wedding
dress
came
last
night
she
stood
clutching
a
tapestry
in
her
slim
white
hand
in
the
gloom
of
that
dull
old
balcony
her
eyes
shone
strangely
some
things
are
to
be
she
whispered
and
very
faintly
others
are
a
thrill
shot
through
minot
sharp
as
a
pain
but
glorious
what
did
she
mean
by
that
what
indeed
but
the
one
thing
that
must
not
happen
the
thing
he
wanted
most
of
all
things
in
the
world
to
happen
the
thing
he
had
come
to
san
marco
to
prevent
he
came
closer
to
her
and
closer
the
blood
was
pounding
in
his
brain
dazed
exulting
he
held
out
his
arms
cynthia
he
cried
and
then
suddenly
behind
her
on
the
stairs
he
caught
sight
of
a
great
bald
head
ascending
through
the
dusk
it
was
an
ordinary
bald
head
the
property
of
stacy
in
fact
but
to
minot
a
certain
jephson
seemed
to
be
moving
beneath
it
he
remembered
his
arms
fell
to
his
sides
he
turned
away
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
he
said
mechanically
yes
cynthia
meyrick
agreed
in
an
odd
tone
we
must
see
what
can
be
done
and
a
tear
unnoticed
fell
on
stacy

a
bit
of
a
blow
miss
meyrick
turned
back
toward
the
room
of
chance
to
find
her
father
minot
meanwhile
ran
down
the
steps
obtained
his
hat
and
coat
and
hurried
across
the
street
to
the
hotel
he
went
at
once
to
rooms
there
he
encountered
a
scene
of
wild
disorder
the
valet
was
packing
trunks
against
time
and
his
bill
huntley
sat
in
a
corner
grim
and
silent
watch
in
hand
lord
harrowby
paced
the
floor
madly
when
he
saw
minot
he
held
out
his
long
lean
helpless
hands
you
heard
old
boy
he
said
yes
i
heard
said
minot
sharply
a
fine
fix
harrowby
why
the
deuce
did
you
pay
the
duty
on
that
necklace
dear
boy
was
saving
every
cent
i
had
for
you
know
what
besides
i
heard
of
such
a
clever
scheme
for
slipping
it
in
never
mind
that
huntley
this
gentleman
was
to
have
been
married
on
tuesday
ca
you
hold
off
until
then
nothing
doing
said
huntley
firmly
i
got
to
get
back
to
new
york
he
have
to
postpone
his
wedding
ought
to
have
thought
of
these
things
before
he
pulled
off
his
little
stunt
it
no
use
minot
said
harrowby
hopelessly
i
gone
all
over
it
with
this
chap
he
wo
listen
to
reason
what
the
deuce
am
i
to
do
a
knock
sounded
on
the
door
and
spencer
meyrick
flirting
with
apoplexy
strode
into
the
room
lord
harrowby
he
announced
i
desire
to
see
you
alone
er
step
into
the
bedroom
harrowby
suggested
huntley
rose
promptly
to
his
feet
nix
he
said
there
a
door
out
of
that
room
leading
into
the
hall
if
you
go
in
there
i
go
too
meyrick
glared
harrowby
stood
embarrassed
very
well
said
meyrick
through
his
teeth
we
stay
here
it
does
matter
to
me
i
simply
want
to
say
lord
harrowby
that
when
you
get
to
jersey
city
you
need
trouble
to
come
back
as
far
as
my
family
is
concerned
a
look
of
pain
came
into
harrowby
thin
face
not
come
back
he
said
my
dear
sir
that
what
i
said
i
a
plain
man
harrowby
a
plain
american
it
does
seem
to
me
that
marrying
into
the
british
nobility
is
worth
all
the
trouble
it
costing
us
but
really
it
may
be
but
it
does
look
that
way
to
me
i
prefer
a
simple
wedding
to
a
series
of
vaudeville
acts
if
you
think
i
going
to
stand
for
the
publicity
of
this
latest
affair
you
mistaken
talked
matters
over
with
cynthia
the
marriage
is
off
for
good
but
my
dear
sir
cynthia
and
i
are
very
fond
of
each
other
i
do
give
a
damn
if
you
are
meyrick
fumed
this
is
the
last
straw
i
through
with
you
good
night
and
he
stamped
out
as
he
had
come
and
lord
harrowby
fell
limply
into
a
chair
all
over
and
all
done
he
moaned
and
jephson
loses
said
minot
with
mixed
emotions
yes
i
sorry
harrowby
shook
his
head
tragically
sorrier
than
you
are
old
chap
i
love
cynthia
meyrick
really
i
do
this
is
a
bit
of
a
blow
come
come
cried
huntley
i
not
going
to
miss
that
train
while
you
we
only
got
half
an
hour
now
harrowby
rose
unhappily
and
went
into
the
inner
room
huntley
at
his
heels
minot
sat
his
unseeing
eyes
gazing
down
at
the
old
copy
of
the
which
harrowby
had
been
reading
that
morning
at
breakfast
gradually
despite
his
preoccupation
a
name
in
a
forced
itself
to
his
attention
courtney
giles
where
had
he
heard
that
name
before
he
picked
up
the
from
the
table
on
which
it
was
lying
he
read
ardent
the
new
romantic
comedy
in
which
courtney
giles
has
appeared
briefly
at
the
west
end
road
theater
will
be
removed
from
the
boards
the
public
has
not
been
appreciative
if
truth
must
be
told
and
bitter
truth
it
is
the
once
beloved
matinée
idol
has
become
too
fat
to
hold
his
old
admirers
and
they
have
drifted
steadily
to
other
slimmer
gods
giles
early
retirement
from
the
stage
is
rumored
minot
threw
down
the
paper
poor
old
jephson
first
the
rain
on
the
dowager
duchess
then
an
actor
expanding
waist
and
the
news
that
harrowby
wedding
was
not
to
be
why
it
would
ruin
the
man
minot
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
inner
room
i
going
out
to
think
he
announced
i
see
you
in
the
lobby
before
you
leave
two
minutes
later
in
the
where
he
had
bid
to
the
sparkling
gaiety
lady
he
sat
puffing
furiously
at
a
cigar
back
into
the
past
as
it
concerned
chain
lightning
collar
he
went
that
night
when
cynthia
meyrick
had
worn
it
in
her
hair
and
harrowby
hearing
of
the
search
for
it
had
snatched
it
in
the
dark
his
own
guardianship
of
the
valuable
trinket
martin
wall
invasion
of
his
rooms
the
dropping
of
the
jewels
on
shipboard
and
the
return
of
them
by
wall
next
morning
and
last
but
not
least
stacy
firm
refusal
to
loan
money
on
the
necklace
that
very
night
all
these
things
minot
pondered
meanwhile
harrowby
having
finished
his
packing
descended
to
the
lobby
of
the
de
la
pax
in
a
certain
pink
parlor
he
found
cynthia
meyrick
and
stood
gazing
helplessly
into
her
eyes
cynthia
your
father
said
is
it
true
it
true
allan
you
too
wish
the
wedding
indefinitely
postponed
father
thinks
it
best
but
you
he
came
closer
you
cynthia
i
i
do
know
there
has
been
so
much
trouble
allan
i
know
and
i
fearfully
sorry
about
this
latest
but
cynthia
you
must
send
me
away
i
love
you
do
you
doubt
that
no
allan
you
the
most
wonderful
girl
who
has
ever
come
into
my
life
i
want
you
in
it
always
beside
me
at
any
rate
allan
a
wedding
next
tuesday
is
impossible
now
yes
i
afraid
it
is
and
after
that
after
that
i
do
know
allan
aunt
mary
came
into
the
room
distress
written
plainly
in
her
plump
face
no
misstep
of
the
peerage
was
beyond
aunt
mary
forgiveness
she
took
harrowby
hand
i
so
sorry
your
lordship
she
said
most
unfortunate
but
sure
it
will
all
be
cleared
away
in
time
huntley
made
it
a
point
to
interrupt
he
stood
at
the
door
watch
in
hand
come
on
he
said
we
got
to
start
harrowby
followed
the
ladies
from
the
room
in
the
lobby
spencer
meyrick
joined
them
his
lordship
shook
hands
with
aunt
mary
with
meyrick
then
he
turned
to
the
girl
cynthia
he
said
unhappily
he
took
her
slim
white
hand
in
his
then
he
turned
quickly
and
started
with
huntley
for
the
door
it
was
at
this
point
that
minot
his
cigar
and
his
cogitations
finished
entered
upon
the
scene
just
a
minute
he
said
to
huntley
not
another
minute
remarked
huntley
with
decision
not
for
the
king
of
england
himself
we
got
just
fifteen
of
left
to
catch
that
train
and
if
i
know
san
marco
hackmen
you
got
time
to
answer
one
or
two
questions
impressed
by
tone
the
meyrick
family
moved
nearer
there
no
doubt
is
there
huntley
that
the
necklace
you
have
in
your
pocket
is
the
one
lord
harrowby
brought
from
england
of
course
not
now
get
out
of
the
way
are
you
a
good
judge
of
jewels
mr
huntley
well
i
got
a
little
reputation
in
that
line
but
say
then
i
suggest
said
minot
impressively
that
you
examine
chain
lightning
collar
closely
thanks
for
the
suggestion
sneered
huntley
i
follow
it
when
i
get
time
just
now
i
got
to
you
better
follow
it
now
before
you
catch
a
train
otherwise
you
may
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
make
a
fool
of
yourself
huntley
stood
hesitating
there
was
something
in
minot
tone
that
rang
true
the
detective
again
looked
at
his
watch
then
with
one
of
his
celebrated
grunts
he
pulled
out
the
necklace
and
stood
staring
at
it
with
a
new
expression
he
grunted
again
and
stepped
to
a
above
which
hung
a
powerful
electric
light
the
others
followed
huntley
laid
the
necklace
on
the
desk
and
took
out
a
small
microscope
which
was
attached
to
one
end
of
his
with
rapt
gaze
he
stared
at
the
largest
of
the
diamonds
he
went
the
length
of
the
string
examining
each
stone
in
turn
the
expression
on
huntley
face
would
have
made
him
a
star
in
the
movies
hell
he
cried
and
threw
chain
lightning
collar
down
on
the
desk
what
the
matter
minot
smiled
glass
snarled
huntley
fine
old
bottle
glass
what
do
you
know
about
that
but
really
it
ca
be
put
in
harrowby
well
it
is
huntley
glared
at
him
the
inspector
might
have
known
you
noblemen
ai
got
any
of
the
real
stuff
left
i
wo
believe
it
harrowby
began
but
caught
minot
eye
it
true
just
the
same
minot
said
by
the
way
huntley
how
much
is
that
little
ornament
worth
about
nine
dollars
and
cents
huntley
still
glared
angrily
well
you
ca
take
lord
harrowby
back
for
not
declaring
that
can
you
no
snorted
huntley
but
i
can
go
back
myself
and
i
going
on
that
midnight
train
minot
followed
him
to
the
door
are
you
going
to
thank
me
he
asked
you
know
i
saved
you
thank
you
hell
said
huntley
and
disappeared
into
the
dark
when
minot
returned
he
found
harrowby
standing
facing
the
meyricks
and
holding
the
necklace
in
his
hand
as
though
it
were
a
bomb
on
the
point
of
exploding
i
say
i
feel
rather
low
he
was
saying
when
i
remember
that
i
made
you
a
present
of
this
thing
cynthia
but
on
my
honor
i
did
know
and
i
can
scarcely
believe
it
now
i
know
the
governor
has
been
financially
embarrassed
but
i
never
suspected
him
of
this
the
associations
were
so
dear
really
it
may
not
have
been
your
father
who
duplicated
chain
collar
with
a
fake
minot
suggested
my
word
old
boy
who
then
you
remember
said
minot
addressing
the
meyricks
that
the
necklace
was
stolen
recently
well
it
was
returned
to
lord
harrowby
under
unusual
circumstances
at
least
this
collection
of
glass
was
returned
my
theory
is
that
the
thief
had
a
duplicate
made
an
old
trick
the
very
idea
harrowby
cried
i
say
minot
you
are
clever
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
thanks
said
minot
dryly
he
sought
to
avoid
miss
cynthia
eyes
er
by
the
way
said
harrowby
looking
at
spencer
meyrick
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
wedding
now
the
old
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
leave
that
to
my
daughter
he
said
and
turned
away
cynthia
harrowby
pleaded
miss
meyrick
cast
a
strange
look
at
minot
standing
forlorn
before
her
and
then
she
smiled
not
very
happily
there
seems
to
be
no
reason
for
changing
our
plans
she
said
slowly
it
would
be
a
great
disappointment
to
so
many
people
good
night
minot
followed
her
to
the
elevator
it
as
i
told
you
this
morning
he
said
miserably
i
just
one
of
the
pawns
in
the
hands
of
the
master
of
the
show
i
ca
explain
what
is
there
to
explain
the
girl
asked
coldly
i
congratulate
you
on
a
highly
successful
evening
the
elevator
door
banged
shut
between
them
turning
minot
encountered
aunt
mary
you
clever
boy
she
cried
we
are
all
so
very
grateful
to
you
you
have
saved
us
from
a
very
embarrassing
situation
please
do
mention
it
minot
replied
and
he
meant
it
he
sat
down
beside
the
dazed
harrowby
on
one
of
the
lobby
sofas
i
all
at
sea
really
old
chap
harrowby
confessed
but
i
must
say
i
admire
you
tremendously
how
the
devil
did
you
know
the
necklace
was
a
fraud
i
did
know
i
guessed
said
minot
and
the
thing
that
led
me
to
make
that
happy
guess
was
tom
stacy
refusal
to
loan
you
money
on
it
stacy
is
no
fool
and
you
think
that
martin
wall
has
the
real
chain
lightning
collar
it
looks
that
way
to
me
there
only
one
thing
against
my
theory
he
did
clear
out
when
he
had
the
chance
but
he
may
be
staying
on
to
avert
suspicion
we
have
any
evidence
to
arrest
him
on
and
if
we
did
there
be
the
customs
people
to
deal
with
if
i
were
you
hire
a
private
detective
to
watch
wall
and
try
to
get
the
real
necklace
back
without
enlisting
the
arm
of
the
law
really
said
harrowby
things
are
happening
so
swiftly
i
at
a
loss
to
follow
them
i
am
old
boy
first
one
obstacle
and
then
another
you
been
splendid
minot
splendid
i
want
to
thank
you
for
all
you
have
done
i
thought
the
wedding
had
gone
glimmering
and
i
fond
of
miss
meyrick
tremendously
do
thank
me
minot
replied
i
not
doing
it
for
you
we
both
know
that
i
protecting
jephson
money
in
a
few
days
and
then
me
back
to
new
york
shouting
never
again
on
the
cupid
act
if
i
ever
roped
into
another
job
like
this
it
has
been
a
trying
position
for
you
harrowby
said
sympathetically
and
you
done
nobly
i
sure
your
troubles
are
all
out
of
the
way
now
with
the
necklace
worry
gone
he
paused
for
across
the
lobby
toward
them
walked
henry
trimmer
and
his
walk
was
that
of
a
man
who
is
going
somewhere
ah
mister
harrowby
he
boomed
and
minot
i
been
looking
for
you
both
it
will
interest
you
to
know
that
i
had
a
wireless
message
from
lord
harrowby
this
noon
a
wireless
cried
minot
yes
trimmer
laughed
not
such
a
fool
as
you
think
him
lord
harrowby
is
managed
to
send
me
a
wireless
from
tarragona
despite
the
attentions
of
your
friends
so
i
went
out
there
this
afternoon
and
brought
george
back
with
me
silently
minot
and
harrowby
stared
at
each
other
yes
mr
trimmer
went
on
george
is
back
again
back
under
the
direction
of
little
me
a
publicity
man
with
no
grass
under
the
feet
i
come
to
give
you
gentlemen
your
choice
you
either
see
lord
harrowby
morning
at
ten
and
recognize
his
claims
or
i
have
you
both
thrown
into
jail
for
kidnaping
morning
at
ten
harrowby
repeated
gloomily
that
what
i
said
replied
mr
trimmer
blithely
how
about
it
little
brother
minot
what
would
you
advise
see
him
sighed
minot
very
well
harrowby
tone
was
resigned
i
presume
i
better
ah
coming
to
your
senses
are
you
said
trimmer
i
hope
we
are
spoiling
the
joyous
but
then
what
i
say
is
if
the
girl
marrying
you
just
for
the
title
harrowby
leaped
to
his
feet
you
have
been
asked
for
an
opinion
he
said
no
of
course
not
do
get
excited
i
see
you
both
in
the
morning
at
ten
and
mr
trimmer
strolled
elegantly
away
harrowby
turned
hopefully
jo
minot
at
ten
in
the
morning
he
repeated
old
chap
what
are
we
going
to
do
at
ten
in
the
morning
i
do
know
smiled
minot
but
if
past
performances
mean
anything
we
win
chapter
xvi
who
who
in
england
what
the
matter
with
you
seated
in
the
lobby
of
the
de
la
pax
on
sunday
morning
mr
trimmer
turned
a
disapproving
eye
upon
the
lank
englishman
at
his
side
as
he
made
this
query
and
his
question
was
not
without
good
foundation
for
the
aspirant
to
the
title
of
lord
harrowby
was
at
the
moment
a
jelly
quaking
with
fear
fawncy
meeting
you
after
all
these
years
said
poor
old
george
in
an
uncertain
treble
come
come
cried
mr
trimmer
put
a
little
more
authority
into
your
voice
you
ca
walk
up
and
claim
your
rights
with
your
knees
dancing
the
tango
this
is
the
moment
we
been
looking
forward
to
act
determined
walk
into
that
room
as
though
you
were
walking
into
rakedale
hall
to
take
charge
of
it
allan
do
you
know
me
i
your
brother
george
went
on
the
englishman
intent
on
rehearsing
more
like
it
said
trimmer
put
the
fire
into
it
you
not
expecting
a
thrashing
you
know
you
expecting
the
title
and
recognition
that
belongs
to
you
i
wish
i
was
the
real
lord
harrowby
i
guess
i
show
a
thing
or
two
i
wish
you
was
agreed
poor
old
george
sadly
somehow
i
do
seem
to
have
the
spirit
i
used
to
have
a
good
point
commented
trimmer
years
of
wrong
and
suffering
have
made
you
timid
i
call
that
to
their
attention
five
minutes
of
ten
your
lordship
his
lordship
groaned
all
right
i
ready
he
said
what
is
it
i
say
as
i
go
in
oh
yes
he
stepped
into
the
elevator
fawncy
seeing
you
after
all
these
years
the
negro
elevator
boy
was
somewhat
startled
at
this
greeting
but
regained
his
composure
and
started
the
car
mr
trimmer
and
his
proposition
shot
up
toward
their
great
opportunity
in
lord
harrowby
suite
that
gentleman
sat
in
considerable
nervousness
awaiting
the
undesired
encounter
with
him
sat
miss
meyrick
and
her
father
whom
he
had
thought
it
necessary
to
invite
to
witness
the
ordeal
richard
minot
uneasily
paced
the
floor
avoiding
as
much
as
possible
the
glances
of
miss
meyrick
brown
eyes
ten
was
upon
him
and
minot
was
no
nearer
a
plan
of
action
than
he
had
been
the
preceding
night
every
good
press
agent
is
not
without
a
live
theatrical
sense
and
mr
trimmer
was
no
exception
he
left
his
trembling
claimant
in
the
entrance
hall
and
strode
into
the
room
good
morning
he
said
brightly
here
we
are
on
time
to
the
minute
ah
i
beg
your
pardon
lord
harrowby
performed
brief
introductions
which
mr
trimmer
effusively
acknowledged
then
he
turned
dramatically
toward
his
lordship
out
here
in
the
hallway
stands
a
poor
broken
creature
he
began
your
own
flesh
and
blood
allan
harrowby
obviously
mr
trimmer
had
prepared
speeches
for
himself
as
well
as
for
poor
old
george
for
twenty
odd
and
impecunious
years
he
went
on
this
man
has
been
denied
his
just
heritage
we
are
here
this
morning
to
perform
a
duty
my
dear
fellow
broke
in
harrowby
wearily
why
should
you
inflict
oratory
upon
us
bring
in
this
er
gentleman
that
i
will
replied
trimmer
heartily
and
when
you
have
heard
his
story
digested
his
evidence
i
am
sure
yes
yes
bring
him
in
mr
trimmer
stepped
to
the
door
he
beckoned
a
very
reluctant
figure
shuffled
in
george
face
was
green
with
fright
his
knees
rattled
together
he
made
altogether
a
ludicrous
picture
and
mr
trimmer
himself
noted
this
with
sinking
heart
allow
me
said
trimmer
theatrically
george
lord
harrowby
george
cleared
his
throat
but
did
not
succeed
in
dislodging
his
heart
which
was
there
at
the
moment
fawncy
seeing
you
after
all
these
years
he
mumbled
weakly
to
no
one
in
particular
speak
up
said
spencer
meyrick
sharply
who
is
it
you
talking
to
to
him
explained
george
nodding
toward
lord
harrowby
to
my
brother
allan
do
you
know
me
allan
do
you
know
he
stopped
an
expression
of
surprise
and
relief
swept
over
his
worried
face
he
turned
triumphantly
to
trimmer
i
do
have
to
prove
who
i
am
to
him
he
announced
why
do
you
demanded
trimmer
in
alarm
because
he
ca
i
fancy
put
in
lord
harrowby
no
said
george
slowly
because
i
never
saw
him
before
in
all
my
life
ah
you
admit
it
cried
allan
harrowby
with
relief
of
course
i
do
replied
george
i
never
saw
you
before
in
my
life
and
you
never
been
at
rakedale
hall
have
you
lord
harrowby
demanded
here
wait
a
minute
shouted
trimmer
in
a
panic
oh
yes
i
been
at
rakedale
hall
said
the
claimant
firmly
i
spent
my
boyhood
there
but
you
never
been
there
i
what
you
never
been
at
rakedale
hall
why
because
you
not
allan
harrowby
that
why
a
deathly
silence
fell
only
a
little
traveling
clock
on
the
mantel
was
articulate
absurd
ridiculous
cried
lord
harrowby
talk
about
impostors
cried
george
his
spirit
and
his
courage
sweeping
back
you
one
yourself
i
wish
i
got
a
good
look
at
you
sooner
i
have
put
a
stop
to
all
this
allan
harrowby
eh
i
guess
not
i
guess
i
know
my
own
brother
if
i
saw
him
i
guess
i
know
the
harrowby
features
i
give
you
hours
to
get
out
of
town
you
blooming
fraud
the
man
crazy
allan
harrowby
cried
raving
mad
he
an
impostor
this
is
a
trick
of
his
he
looked
helplessly
around
the
circle
in
every
face
he
saw
doubt
questioning
good
heavens
you
not
going
to
listen
to
him
he
come
here
to
prove
that
he
george
harrowby
why
does
he
do
it
i
do
it
said
george
sweetly
when
i
meet
a
real
harrowby
in
the
meantime
i
give
you
hours
to
get
out
of
town
better
go
victorious
george
turned
toward
the
door
trimmer
lost
between
admiration
and
doubt
turned
also
take
my
advice
george
proclaimed
make
him
prove
who
he
is
that
the
important
point
now
what
does
it
matter
to
you
who
i
am
nothing
but
it
matters
a
lot
about
him
make
him
prove
that
allan
harrowby
and
with
the
imperious
manner
that
he
should
have
adopted
on
entering
the
room
george
harrowby
left
it
mr
trimmer
eclipsed
for
once
trotted
at
his
side
say
cried
trimmer
in
the
hall
is
that
on
the
level
is
he
allan
harrowby
i
should
say
not
said
george
grandly
does
look
anything
like
allan
trimmer
chortled
in
glee
great
stuff
he
cried
i
guess
we
tossed
a
bomb

out
of
town

george

our
work

trimmer
that
we
will
by
gad
i
proud
of
you
lord
harrowby
inside
allan
harrowby
suite
three
pairs
of
questioning
eyes
were
turned
on
that
harassed
nobleman
he
fidgeted
in
his
chair
i
say
he
pleaded
it
all
his
bluff
you
know
maybe
said
old
spencer
meyrick
rising
but
harrowby
or
whatever
your
name
is
there
altogether
too
much
circus
about
this
wedding
to
suit
me
my
patience
is
exhausted
sir
clean
exhausted
things
look
queer
to
me
have
right
along
i
more
than
inclined
to
believe
what
that
fellow
said
but
my
dear
sir
that
chap
is
a
rank
impostor
there
was
a
word
of
truth
in
what
he
said
cynthia
you
understand
why
yes
i
suppose
so
the
girl
replied
you
are
allan
harrowby
are
you
my
dear
girl
of
course
i
am
nevertheless
said
spencer
meyrick
with
decision
i
going
to
call
the
wedding
off
again
some
of
your
actions
have
made
much
of
a
hit
with
me
i
going
to
call
it
off
until
you
come
to
me
and
prove
that
you
allan
harrowby
a
lord
in
good
and
regular
standing
with
all
dues
paid
but
confound
it
sir
a
gentleman
word
meyrick
put
in
minot
may
i
be
allowed
to
say
that
i
consider
your
action
hasty
and
may
i
be
allowed
to
ask
what
affair
this
is
of
yours
demanded
meyrick
hotly
father
cried
miss
meyrick
please
do
not
be
harsh
with
minot
his
heart
is
absolutely
set
on
my
marriage
with
lord
harrowby
naturally
he
feels
very
badly
over
all
this
minot
winced
come
cynthia
said
meyrick
moving
toward
the
door
i
had
enough
of
this
remember
sir
the
wedding
is
off
absolutely
off
until
you
are
able
to
establish
your
identity
beyond
question
and
he
and
his
daughter
went
out
minot
sat
for
a
long
time
staring
at
lord
harrowby
finally
he
spoke
say
harrowby
he
inquired
who
the
devil
are
you
his
lordship
sadly
shook
his
head
you
too
brutus
he
sighed
have
i
one
friend
left
i
allan
harrowby
ask
jephson
if
i
were
that
policy
that
causing
you
so
much
trouble
would
be
worth
the
paper
it
written
on
that
right
too
well
admitting
you
harrowby
how
are
you
going
to
prove
it
i
an
idea
harrowby
replied
everything
comes
to
him
who
waits
what
is
it
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
an
old
oxford
friend
is
attached
to
our
embassy
at
washington
he
was
planning
to
come
down
for
the
wedding
i
telegraph
him
to
board
the
next
train
good
boy
said
minot
that
a
regular
idea
better
send
the
wire
at
once
harrowby
promised
and
they
parted
in
the
lobby
below
minot
met
jack
paddock
paddock
looked
drawn
and
worried
working
up
my
stuff
for
the
dinner
the
little
lismore
lady
is
giving
to
the
bridal
party
night
he
confided
say
it
no
cinch
to
do
two
of
them
ca
you
suggest
a
topic
that
liable
to
come
up
yes
replied
minot
i
can
suggest
one
fake
noblemen
and
he
related
to
paddock
the
astounding
events
of
the
morning
that
sunday
that
had
begun
so
startlingly
progressed
as
a
sunday
should
in
peace
early
in
the
afternoon
harrowby
hunted
minot
up
and
announced
that
his
friend
would
arrive
monday
noon
and
that
the
meyricks
had
agreed
to
take
no
definite
step
pending
his
arrival
shortly
after
six
a
delayed
telegram
was
delivered
to
minot
it
was
from
thacker
and
it
read
have
located
the
owner
of
the
yacht
its
real
name
the
stolen
from
owner
in
north
river
he
is
on
his
way
south
will
look
you
up
on
arrival
minot
whistled
here
was
a
new
twist
for
the
drama
to
take
at
about
the
same
time
that
minot
received
his
message
a
similar
slip
of
yellow
paper
was
put
into
the
hands
of
lord
harrowby
three
times
he
read
it
his
eyes
staring
his
cheeks
flushed
then
he
fled
to
his
rooms
the
elevator
was
not
quick
enough
he
sped
up
the
stairs
once
in
his
suite
he
dragged
out
the
nearest
and
began
to
pack
like
a
mad
man
minot
was
finishing
a
leisurely
and
lonely
dinner
about
an
hour
later
when
jack
paddock
ran
up
to
his
table
paddock
usual
calm
was
sadly
ruffled
dick
he
cried
here
news
for
you
i
met
lord
harrowby
sliding
out
a
side
door
with
a
just
now
minot
leaped
to
his
feet
what
does
that
mean
he
wondered
aloud
mean
answered
paddock
it
means
just
one
thing
old
george
had
the
right
dope
harrowby
is
a
fake
he
making
his
minot
threw
down
his
napkin
oh
he
is

he
he
cried
well
i
guess
not
come
on
jack
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
going
down
to
the
station
and
stop
him
he
caused
me
too
much
trouble
to
let
him
slide
out
like
this
a
fake
eh
well
i
have
him
behind
the
bars
a
negro
cab
driver
was
by
superhuman
efforts
roused
to
hasty
action
he
rattled
the
two
young
men
wildly
down
the
silent
street
to
the
railway
station
they
dashed
into
the
drab
little
waiting
room
just
as
a
voice
called
train
for
the
north
jacksonville
savannah
washington
new
york
there
he
is
paddock
cried
and
pointed
to
the
lean
figure
of
lord
harrowby
slipping
out
the
door
nearest
the
paddock
and
minot
ran
across
the
waiting
room
and
out
into
the
open
in
the
distance
they
saw
harrowby
passing
through
the
gate
and
on
to
the
tracks
they
ran
up
just
in
time
to
have
the
gate
banged
shut
in
their
faces
here
cried
minot
i
got
to
get
in
there
let
me
through
where
your
ticket
demanded
the
great
stone
face
on
guard
i
have
got
one
but
too
late
anyhow
said
the
face
the
train
started
through
the
wooden
pickets
minot
saw
the
long
yellow
string
of
coaches
slipping
by
he
turned
to
paddock
oh
very
well
he
cried
exulting
let
him
go
come
on
he
dashed
back
to
the
carriage
that
had
brought
them
from
the
hotel
the
driver
of
which
sat
in
a
stupor
trying
to
regain
his
wits
and
nonchalance
what
now
paddock
wanted
to
know
get
in
commanded
minot
he
pushed
his
friend
on
to
the
musty
seat
and
followed
to
the
de
la
pax
he
cried
as
fast
as
you
can
go
but
what
the
devil
the
need
of
hurrying
now
demanded
paddock
all
the
need
in
the
world
replied
minot
joyously
i
going
to
have
a
talk
with
cynthia
meyrick
a
little
talk
alone
ah
said
paddock
softly
love
young
dream
chapter
xvii
the
shortest
way
home
the
moon
was
shining
in
that
city
of
the
picturesque
past
its
light
fell
silvery
on
the
narrow
streets
the
old
adobe
houses
the
listless
palms
in
every
shadow
seemed
to
lurk
the
memory
of
a
love
long
dead
a
love
of
the
old
passionate
spanish
days
a
soft
breeze
came
whispering
from
the
very
sea
ponce
de
leon
had
sailed
it
was
as
if
at
a
signal
a
a
rose
thrown
from
a
window
the
boom
of
a
cannon
at
the
water
edge
the
forgotten
past
of
hot
hearts
of
arms
equally
ready
for
cutlass
or
slender
waist
could
live
again
and
minot
was
as
one
who
had
heard
such
a
signal
he
loved
the
obstacle
that
had
confronted
him
wrung
his
heart
left
him
helpless
was
swept
away
he
was
like
a
man
who
released
from
prison
sees
the
sky
the
green
trees
the
hills
again
he
loved
the
moon
was
shining
he
stood
amid
the
colorful
blooms
of
the
hotel
courtyard
and
looked
up
at
her
window
with
its
white
curtain
waving
gently
in
the
breeze
he
called
softly
and
then
he
saw
her
face
peering
out
as
some
senorita
of
the
old
days
from
her
lattice
i
news
very
important
news
he
said
may
i
see
you
a
moment
far
better
this
than
the
telephone
or
the
bellboy
far
more
in
keeping
with
the
magic
of
the
night
she
came
dressed
in
the
white
that
set
off
so
well
her
hair
of
gleaming
copper
minot
met
her
on
the
veranda
she
smiled
into
his
eyes
inquiringly
do
you
mind
a
little
walk
he
asked
where
to
say
to
the
fort
the
longest
way
she
glanced
back
toward
the
hotel
i
not
sure
that
i
ought
but
that
will
only
make
it
the
more
exciting
please
and
news
real
news
she
nodded
her
head
and
they
crossed
the
courtyard
to
the
avenue
from
this
bright
thoroughfare
they
turned
in
a
moment
into
a
dark
and
unkempt
street
see
said
minot
suddenly
the
old
spanish
churchyard
they
built
cities
around
churches
in
the
old
days
the
world
do
move
railroad
stations
now
they
stood
peering
through
the
gloom
at
a
small
chapel
dim
amid
the
trees
and
aged
stones
leaning
tipsily
among
the
weeds
at
the
altar
of
that
chapel
minot
said
a
priest
fell
shot
in
the
back
by
an
indian
arrow
sounds
unreal
does
it
and
when
you
think
that
under
these
musty
stones
lies
the
dust
of
folks
who
walked
this
very
ground
and
loved
and
hated
like
you
and
yes
but
is
it
all
rather
gloomy
cynthia
meyrick
shuddered
they
went
on
to
pass
shortly
through
the
crumbling
remains
of
the
city
gates
there
at
the
water
edge
the
great
gray
fort
loomed
in
the
moonlight
like
a
historical
novelist
dream
its
huge
doors
were
locked
for
the
night
its
custodian
home
in
the
bosom
of
his
family
only
its
lower
ramparts
were
left
for
the
feet
of
romantic
youth
to
tread
along
these
ramparts
close
to
the
shimmering
sea
miss
meyrick
and
minot
walked
truth
to
tell
it
was
not
so
very
difficult
to
keep
one
footing
but
once
the
girl
was
forced
to
hold
out
an
appealing
hand
french
heels
are
treacherous
she
explained
minot
took
her
hand
and
for
the
first
time
knew
the
thrill
that
encountered
often
on
the
printed
page
he
had
mentally
classed
as
rubbish
wisely
she
interrupted
it
you
said
you
had
news
he
had
but
it
was
not
so
easy
to
impart
as
he
had
expected
tell
me
he
said
if
it
should
turn
out
that
what
poor
old
george
said
this
morning
was
a
fact
that
allan
harrowby
was
an
impostor
would
you
feel
so
very
badly
she
withdrew
her
hand
you
have
no
right
to
ask
that
she
replied
forgive
me
indeed
i
have
but
i
was
moved
to
ask
it
for
the
reason
that
what
george
said
was
evidently
true
allan
harrowby
left
suddenly
for
the
north
an
hour
ago
the
girl
stood
still
looking
with
wide
eyes
out
over
the
sea
left
for
the
north
she
repeated
there
was
a
long
silence
at
length
she
turned
to
minot
a
queer
light
in
her
eyes
of
course
you
go
after
him
and
bring
him
back
she
asked
no
minot
bowed
his
head
i
know
i
must
have
looked
rather
silly
of
late
but
if
you
think
i
did
the
things
i
done
because
i
chose
to
you
wrong
if
you
think
i
did
them
because
i
did
love
you
you
wrong
too
oh
i
mr
minot
i
ca
help
it
i
know
it
indecently
soon
i
got
to
tell
you
just
the
same
there
been
so
much
in
the
way
i
wild
to
say
it
now
i
love
you
the
water
breaking
on
the
ancient
stones
below
seemed
to
be
repeating
sh
sh
but
minot
paid
no
heed
to
the
warning
i
cared
for
you
he
went
on
ever
since
that
morning
on
the
train
when
we
raced
the
ever
since
that
wonderful
ride
over
a
road
that
looked
like
heaven
to
me
and
every
time
since
that
i
seen
you
i
known
that
i
come
to
care
more
the
girl
stood
and
stared
thoughtfully
out
at
the
soft
blue
sea
minot
moved
closer
over
those
perilous
slippery
rocks
i
know
it
an
old
story
to
you
he
went
on
and
that
i
be
a
fool
to
hope
that
i
could
possibly
be
anything
but
just
another
man
who
adores
you
but
because
i
love
you
so
much
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
and
in
spite
of
all
this
she
said
slowly
from
the
first
you
have
done
everything
in
your
power
to
prevent
the
breaking
off
of
my
engagement
to
harrowby
yes
but
were
you
overly
chivalrous
to
a
rival
would
what
what
you
are
saying
be
more
convincing
if
you
had
remained
neutral
i
know
i
ca
explain
it
to
you
now
it
all
over
anyway
it
was
horrible
while
it
lasted
but
it
over
now
i
never
going
to
work
again
for
your
marriage
to
anybody
except
one
man
the
man
who
is
standing
before
you
who
loves
you
loves
you
he
stopped
for
the
girl
was
smiling
and
it
was
not
the
sort
of
smile
that
his
words
were
entitled
to
i
sorry
really
she
said
but
i
ca
help
it
all
i
can
see
now
is
your
triumphant
entrance
last
night
your
masterly
exposure
of
that
silly
necklace
your
clever
destruction
of
every
obstacle
in
order
that
harrowby
and
i
might
be
married
on
tuesday
in
the
light
of
all
that
has
happened
how
can
you
expect
to
appear
other
than
foolish
you
right
and
you
could
possibly
care
just
a
little
he
stopped
embarrassed
poorly
chosen
words
those
last
he
saw
the
light
of
recollection
in
her
eye
i
should
say
he
went
on
hastily
is
there
just
a
faint
gleam
of
hope
for
me
if
we
were
back
on
the
train
she
said
and
all
that
followed
could
be
different
and
harrowby
had
never
been
i
might
you
might
yes
i
might
not
say
what
i
going
to
say
now
which
is
had
we
better
return
to
the
hotel
i
sorry
remarked
minot
sorry
i
had
the
bad
taste
to
say
what
i
have
at
this
time
but
if
you
knew
and
could
understand
which
you
ca
of
course
yes
let
go
back
to
the
hotel
the
shortest
way
he
turned
and
looked
toward
the
towers
of
the
de
la
pax
rising
to
meet
the
sky
seemingly
a
million
miles
away
so
peary
might
have
gazed
to
the
north
setting
out
for
the
pole
they
went
back
along
the
ramparts
over
the
dry
moat
through
the
crumbling
gates
conversation
languished
then
the
ancient
graveyard
ghastly
in
the
gloom
after
that
the
long
lighted
street
of
humble
shops
and
the
shortest
way
home
seemed
a
million
times
longer
than
the
longest
way
there
considering
what
you
have
told
me
of
harrowby
she
said
i
shall
be
leaving
for
the
north
soon
will
you
look
me
up
in
new
york
thank
you
minot
said
it
will
be
a
very
great
privilege
cynthia
meyrick
entered
the
elevator
and
out
of
sight
in
that
gilded
cage
she
smiled
a
twisted
little
smile
minot
beheld
mr
trimmer
and
his
proposition
basking
in
the
of
the
de
la
pax
and
feeling
in
no
mood
to
listen
to
the
publicity
man
triumphant
cackle
he
hurried
to
the
veranda
there
he
found
a
calling
his
name
to
see
you
the
boy
explained
he
led
the
way
back
into
the
lobby
and
up
to
a
tall
man
with
a
ruddy
frank
attractive
face
the
stranger
held
out
his
hand
minot
of
lloyds
he
asked
how
do
you
do
sir
i
very
glad
to
know
you
promised
thacker
i
look
you
up
at
once
let
adjourn
to
the
minot
followed
in
the
wake
of
the
tall
breezy
one
already
he
liked
the
man
immensely
well
said
the
stranger
over
a
table
in
the
grill
what
you
have
waiter
perhaps
you
heard
i
was
coming
i
happen
to
be
the
owner
of
the
yacht
in
the
harbor
which
somebody
has
rechristened
the
yes
i
thought
so
minot
replied
i
mighty
glad
you
come
a
martin
wall
is
posing
as
the
owner
just
at
present
so
i
learned
from
thacker
nervy
lad
this
wall
i
live
in
chicago
myself
left
my
boat
i
called
her
in
the
north
river
for
the
winter
in
charge
of
a
caretaker
this
wall
it
seems
needed
a
boat
for
a
month
and
took
a
fancy
to
mine
and
since
my
caretaker
was
evidently
a
crook
it
was
a
simple
matter
to
rent
it
never
would
have
found
it
out
except
for
you
people
too
busy
really
ought
not
to
have
taken
this
trip
business
needs
me
every
minute
but
i
got
sort
of
a
hankering
to
meet
martin
wall
shall
we
go
out
to
the
boat
right
away
no
need
of
that
we
run
out
in
the
morning
with
the
proper
authorities
the
stranger
leaned
across
the
table
and
something
in
his
blue
eyes
startled
minot
in
the
meantime
he
said
i
happen
to
be
interested
in
another
matter
what
all
this
talk
about
george
harrowby
coming
back
to
life
well
there
a
chap
here
minot
explained
who
claims
to
be
the
elder
brother
of
allan
harrowby
his
cause
is
in
the
hands
of
an
advertising
expert
named
trimmer
yes
i
saw
a
story
in
a
washington
paper
this
morning
george
harrowby
confronted
allan
harrowby
and
denounced
allan
himself
as
a
fraud
the
man
from
chicago
threw
back
his
head
and
a
roar
of
unexpected
laughter
smote
on
minot
hearing
good
joke
said
the
stranger
no
joke
at
all
george
was
right
at
least
so
it
seems
allan
harrowby
cleared
out
this
evening
yes
so
i
was
told
by
the
clerk
in
there
do
you
happen
to
know
er
allan
yes
very
well
indeed
but
you
do
know
the
reason
he
left
why
answered
minot
i
suppose
because
george
harrowby
gave
him
hours
to
get
out
of
town
again
the
chicago
man
laughed
that
ca
have
been
the
reason
he
said
i
happen
to
know
just
how
inquired
minot
do
you
happen
to
know
leaning
far
back
in
his
chair
the
westerner
smiled
at
minot
with
a
broad
engaging
smile
i
fancy
i
neglected
to
introduce
myself
he
said
i
make
automobiles
in
chicago
and
my
name
george
harrowby
you
you
minot
head
went
round
dizzily
oh
no
he
said
firmly
i
do
believe
it
the
other
smile
grew
even
broader
do
blame
you
a
bit
my
boy
he
said
must
have
been
a
bit
of
a
down
here
then
too
i
do
look
like
an
englishman
want
to
i
an
american
now
and
i
like
it
you
mean
you
the
real
lord
harrowby
that
what
i
mean
take
it
slowly
minot
i
george
and
if
allan
ever
gets
his
eyes
on
me
i
wo
have
to
prove
who
i
am
know
the
kid
will
but
by
the
way
what
i
want
now
is
to
meet
this
chap
who
claims
to
be
me
also
his
friend
mr
trimmer
of
course
you
do
i
saw
them
out
in
the
lobby
a
minute
ago
minot
rose
i
bring
them
in
but
but
what
is
it
oh
never
mind
i
believe
you
trimmer
and
his
proposition
still
adorned
the
lobby
puffed
with
pride
and
pompousness
briefly
minot
explained
that
a
gentleman
in
the
desired
to
be
introduced
and
graciously
the
two
followed
after
the
chicago
george
harrowby
rose
as
he
saw
the
group
approach
his
table
suddenly
behind
him
minot
heard
a
voice
my
god
and
the
limp
englishman
of
the
sandwich
boards
made
a
long
lean
streak
toward
the
door
minot
leaped
after
him
and
dragged
him
back
here
trimmer
he
said
your
proposition
has
chilblains
what
the
trouble
mr
trimmer
glared
about
him
allow
me
said
minot
sir
our
leading
vaudeville
actor
and
his
manager
gentlemen
george
harrowby
of
chicago
sit
down
boys
said
harrowby
genially
he
indicated
a
chair
to
mr
trimmer
but
that
gentleman
stood
his
eyes
frozen
to
the
face
of
his
proposition
the
chicago
man
turned
to
that
same
proposition
brace
up
jenkins
he
said
nobody
will
hurt
you
but
jenkins
could
not
brace
he
allowed
minot
to
deposit
his
limp
body
in
a
chair
i
thought
you
was
dead
sir
he
mumbled
a
common
mistake
smiled
george
harrowby
my
family
has
thought
the
same
and
i
been
too
busy
making
automobiles
to
tell
them
differently
mr
trimmer
will
you
have
a
what
the
matter
man
for
mr
trimmer
was
standing
purple
over
his
proposition
i
want
to
get
this
straight
he
said
with
assumed
calm
see
here
you
cringing
cur
what
does
this
mean
i
thought
he
was
dead
murmured
poor
jenkins
in
terror
you
think
the
same
about
yourself
in
a
minute
and
you
be
trimmer
predicted
come
come
said
george
harrowby
pacifically
sit
down
mr
trimmer
sit
down
and
have
a
drink
do
you
mean
to
say
you
know
jenkins
here
was
faking
of
course
i
did
said
trimmer
he
sat
down
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
as
one
who
proposed
to
rise
soon
all
this
has
got
me
going
i
never
went
round
in
royal
circles
before
and
i
dizzy
i
suppose
you
the
real
lord
harrowby
to
be
quite
correct
i
am
do
you
believe
it
i
can
believe
anything
when
i
look
at
him
said
trimmer
indicating
the
pitiable
to
the
title
say
who
is
this
jenkins
we
hear
so
much
about
jenkins
was
the
son
of
my
father
valet
george
harrowby
explained
he
came
to
america
with
me
we
parted
suddenly
on
a
ranch
in
southern
arizona
everybody
said
you
was
dead
persisted
jenkins
as
one
who
could
not
lose
sight
of
that
fact
yes
and
they
gave
you
my
letters
and
belongings
eh
so
you
thought
you
pose
as
me
yes
sir
confessed
jenkins
humbly
mr
trimmer
slid
farther
back
into
his
chair
well
he
said
it
unbelievable
but
henry
trimmer
has
been
buncoed
i
met
this
able
liar
in
a
in
new
york
and
he
convinced
me
he
was
lord
harrowby
it
was
between
jobs
for
me
and
i
had
a
bright
idea
if
i
brought
this
guy
down
to
the
wedding
established
him
as
the
real
lord
and
raised
cain
generally
i
figured
my
stock
as
a
publicity
man
would
rise
a
hundred
per
cent
i
be
turning
down
jobs
right
and
left
i
suppose
i
was
easy
but
i
never
mixed
up
with
such
things
before
and
all
the
dope
he
had
impressed
me
the
family
coat
of
arms
and
the
motto
the
chicago
man
laughed
softly
he
said
that
was
it
trust
harrowby
said
trimmer
bitterly
lord
what
a
fool
i
been
and
it
ruined
my
career
i
be
the
oh
cheer
up
mr
trimmer
smiled
george
harrowby
i
sure
unduly
pessimistic
about
your
career
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
on
that
score
later
for
the
present
for
the
present
broke
in
trimmer
with
fervor
iron
bars
for
jenkins
here
i
swear
out
the
warrant
myself
nonsense
said
harrowby
jenkins
is
the
most
harmless
creature
in
the
world
led
astray
by
ambition
that
all
with
any
one
but
allan
his
claims
would
have
lasted
five
minutes
poor
allan
always
was
a
helpless
youngster
oh
jenkins
broke
in
minot
suddenly
what
was
the
idea
this
morning
i
mean
your
calling
allan
harrowby
an
impostor
jenkins
hung
his
head
i
was
rattled
he
admitted
i
could
keep
it
up
before
all
those
people
so
it
came
to
me
in
a
flash
if
i
said
allan
was
a
fraud
maybe
i
would
have
to
be
myself
and
that
was
really
allan
harrowby
yes
that
was
allan
right
enough
minot
sat
studying
the
wall
in
front
of
him
he
was
recalling
a
walk
through
the
moonlight
to
the
fort
jephson
and
thacker
pointed
accusing
fingers
at
him
over
the
oceans
and
lands
between
i
say
let
jenkins
go
continued
the
genial
western
harrowby
provided
he
returns
my
property
and
clears
out
for
good
after
all
his
father
was
a
faithful
servant
if
he
is
not
but
objected
trimmer
he
wasted
my
time
he
put
a
crimp
in
the
career
of
the
best
publicity
man
in
america
it
take
years
to
straighten
out
not
necessarily
said
harrowby
i
was
coming
to
that
i
been
watching
your
work
for
the
last
week
and
i
like
it
alive
progressive
we
putting
out
a
new
car
this
spring
an
inexpensive
little
car
bound
to
make
a
hit
i
need
a
man
like
you
to
convince
the
public
mr
trimmer
eyes
opened
wide
they
shone
he
turned
and
regarded
the
unhappy
jenkins
clear
out
he
commanded
if
i
ever
see
you
again
i
wring
your
neck
now
harrowby
you
were
saying
just
a
minute
said
harrowby
this
man
has
certain
letters
and
papers
of
mine
no
he
has
trimmer
replied
i
got
right
here
in
my
pocket
he
slid
a
packet
of
papers
across
the
table
they
yours
now
about
jenkins
was
slipping
silently
away
like
a
frightened
wraith
he
flitted
gratefully
through
the
swinging
doors
a
car
explained
harrowby
and
i
want
a
live
man
to
boost
it
beg
pardon
interrupted
minot
rising
i
say
good
night
get
together
about
that
other
matter
in
the
morning
by
the
way
harrowby
have
you
any
idea
what
has
become
of
allan
no
i
have
i
sent
him
a
telegram
this
afternoon
saying
that
i
was
on
my
way
here
must
have
run
off
on
business
of
course
he
be
back
for
his
wedding
oh
yes
of
course
minot
agreed
sadly
he
be
back
for
his
wedding
good
night
gentlemen
a
few
minutes
later
he
stood
at
the
window
of
gazing
out
at
the
narrow
street
at
the
stately
manhattan
club
and
the
old
spanish
houses
on
either
side
and
she
refused
me
he
muttered
to
think
that
should
be
the
biggest
piece
of
luck
that
come
to
me
since
i
hit
this
accursed
town
he
continued
to
gaze
gloomily
out
the
er
moon
was
still
shining
chapter
xviii
a
rotten
bad
fit
minot
rose
early
on
monday
morning
and
went
for
a
walk
along
the
beach
he
had
awakened
to
black
despair
but
the
sun
and
the
matutinal
breeze
elevated
his
spirits
considerably
where
was
allan
harrowby
gone
with
his
wedding
little
more
than
hours
away
if
he
should
not
return
golden
thought
by
his
own
act
he
would
forfeit
his
claim
on
jephson
and
minot
would
be
free
to
to
what
before
him
in
the
morning
glow
the
great
gray
fort
rose
to
crush
his
hopes
there
on
those
slanting
ramparts
she
had
smiled
at
his
declaration
smiled
and
labeled
him
foolish
well
foolish
he
must
have
seemed
but
there
was
still
hope
if
only
allan
harrowby
did
not
return
mr
trimmer
his
head
down
breathing
hard
marched
along
the
beach
like
a
man
with
a
destination
seeing
minot
he
stopped
suddenly
good
morning
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
with
a
smile
no
reason
why
we
should
be
friends
eh
none
whatever
you
out
early
so
am
i
thinking
up
ideas
for
the
automobile
campaign
minot
laughed
you
leap
from
one
proposition
to
another
with
wonderful
aplomb
he
said
the
agile
mountain
goat
hopping
from
peak
to
peak
trimmer
replied
that
me
oh
i
the
goat
all
right
sad
old
jenkins
put
it
all
over
me
did
he
i
afraid
he
did
where
is
he
ask
of
the
railway
folder
he
lit
out
in
the
night
say
he
did
have
a
convincing
way
with
him
you
know
it
he
surely
did
well
the
best
of
us
make
mistakes
admitted
mr
trimmer
the
trouble
with
me
is
i
too
enthusiastic
once
i
get
an
idea
i
see
rosy
for
miles
ahead
as
i
look
back
i
realize
that
i
actually
helped
jenkins
prove
to
me
that
he
was
lord
harrowby
i
was
so
anxious
for
him
to
do
it
the
chance
seemed
so
gorgeous
and
if
i
put
it
over
but
there
the
automobile
business
looks
mighty
good
to
me
now
watch
the
papers
for
details
and
when
you
get
back
to
broadway
keep
a
lookout
for
the
hand
of
trimmer
writing
in
fire
on
the
sky
i
will
promised
minot
laughing
he
turned
back
to
the
hotel
shortly
after
his
meeting
with
trimmer
had
cheered
him
mightily
with
a
hopeful
eye
worthy
of
trimmer
himself
he
looked
toward
the
future
hours
would
decide
it
if
only
allan
failed
to
return
the
first
man
minot
saw
when
he
entered
the
lobby
of
the
de
la
pax
was
allan
harrowby
his
eyes
tired
with
travel
handing
over
a
to
an
eager
black
boy
what
was
the
use
listlessly
minot
relinquished
his
last
hope
he
followed
harrowby
and
touched
his
arm
good
morning
he
said
drearily
you
gave
us
all
quite
a
turn
last
night
we
thought
you
taken
the
advice
you
got
in
the
morning
and
cleared
out
for
good
well
hardly
harrowby
replied
come
up
to
the
room
old
man
explain
there
before
we
go
up
replied
minot
i
want
you
to
get
miss
meyrick
on
the
phone
and
tell
her
you
returned
yes
right
away
you
see
last
night
i
rather
misunderstood
i
thought
you
were
allan
harrowby
after
all
and
i
afraid
i
gave
miss
meyrick
a
wrong
impression
by
gad
i
should
have
told
her
i
was
going
harrowby
replied
but
i
was
so
rattled
you
know
he
went
into
a
booth
his
brief
talk
ended
he
and
minot
entered
the
elevator
once
in
his
suite
harrowby
dropped
wearily
into
a
chair
confound
your
stupid
trains
i
been
traveling
for
ages
now
minot
i
tell
you
what
carried
me
off
yesterday
afternoon
i
got
a
message
from
my
brother
george
saying
he
was
on
his
way
here
yes
seems
he
alive
and
in
business
in
chicago
the
news
excited
me
a
bit
old
boy
i
pictured
george
rushing
in
here
and
the
word
spreading
that
i
was
not
to
be
the
earl
of
raybrook
after
all
frightfully
fond
of
miss
meyrick
and
i
want
that
wedding
to
take
place
then
too
there
jephson
understand
me
cynthia
is
not
marrying
me
for
my
title
i
stake
my
life
on
that
but
there
the
father
and
aunt
mary
and
considering
the
number
of
times
the
old
gentleman
has
forbidden
the
wedding
already
you
saw
it
was
up
to
you
for
once
exactly
so
for
my
own
sake
and
jephson
i
boarded
a
train
for
jacksonville
with
the
idea
of
meeting
george
train
there
and
coming
on
here
with
him
i
was
going
to
ask
george
not
to
make
himself
known
for
a
couple
of
days
then
i
proposed
to
tell
cynthia
and
cynthia
only
of
his
existence
if
she
objected
all
very
well
but
i
sure
she
would
and
i
sure
too
that
george
would
have
done
what
i
asked
he
always
was
a
bully
chap
but
i
missed
him
these
confounded
trains
always
late
except
when
you
want
them
to
be
i
dare
say
george
is
here
by
this
time
he
is
minot
replied
came
a
few
hours
after
you
left
and
by
the
way
i
arranged
a
meeting
for
him
with
trimmer
and
his
proposition
the
proposition
fled
into
the
night
it
seems
he
was
the
son
of
an
old
servant
of
your
father
jenkins
by
name
surely
surely
that
was
jenkins
i
thought
i
seen
the
chap
somewhere
could
quite
recall
well
at
any
rate
he
out
of
the
way
now
the
thing
to
do
is
to
see
good
old
george
at
once
he
went
to
the
telephone
and
got
his
brother
room
george
a
surprising
note
of
affection
crept
into
his
voice
george
old
boy
this
is
allan
i
waiting
for
you
in
my
rooms
dear
old
chap
said
his
lordship
turning
away
from
the
telephone
years
since
he
has
seen
one
of
his
own
flesh
and
blood
years
of
wandering
in
this
country
i
beg
your
pardon
minot
i
wonder
what
he
say
to
me
i
wonder
what
george
will
say
after
all
those
years
nervously
allan
harrowby
walked
the
floor
in
a
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
tall
blond
chicago
man
stood
in
the
doorway
his
blue
eyes
glowed
without
a
word
he
came
into
the
room
and
gripped
the
hand
of
his
brother
then
stood
gazing
as
if
he
would
never
get
enough
and
then
george
harrowby
spoke
is
that
a
suit
you
have
on
allan
he
asked
huskily
why
why
yes
george
i
thought
so
it
a
rotten
bad
fit
allan
a
rotten
bad
fit
thus
did
george
harrowby
greet
the
first
of
his
kin
he
had
seen
in
a
quarter
of
a
century
thus
did
he
give
the
lie
to
fiction
and
to
trimmer
writer
of
fancy
seeing
you
after
all
these
years
speeches
he
dropped
his
younger
brother
hand
and
strode
to
the
window
he
looked
out
the
courtyard
of
the
de
la
pax
was
strangely
misty
even
in
the
morning
sunlight
then
he
turned
smiling
how
the
old
boy
he
asked
he
well
george
speaks
of
you
now
and
then
think
he
like
to
see
you
why
not
run
over
and
look
him
up
i
will
george
harrowby
turned
again
to
the
window
ought
to
have
buried
the
hatchet
long
ago
been
so
busy
but
i
change
all
that
i
run
over
and
see
him
first
chance
i
get
and
i
write
to
him
good
great
to
see
you
again
george
heard
you
shuffled
off
not
much
alive
and
well
in
chicago
great
to
see
you
suppose
you
know
about
the
wedding
yes
fine
girl
too
had
a
waiter
point
her
out
to
me
at
breakfast
rather
rude
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
see
her
er
pretty
far
gone
and
all
that
allan
pretty
far
gone
that
the
eye
i
was
afraid
it
might
be
a
financial
proposition
until
i
saw
the
girl
allan
shifted
nervously
ah
er
of
course
you
lord
harrowby
he
said
george
harrowby
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
his
hearty
pleasant
laugh
sit
down
kid
he
said
and
the
scion
of
nobility
thus
informally
addressed

i
thought

george
harrowby
also
dropping

to
a
home

that
with
the
news
that
i
was
lord
harrowby
in
line
to
become
the
earl
of

there

a
riot

her
wits

an
outcast
in
my
own
family
neighbors

turn

me
lord

eh

fall
off
smilingly
george
harrowby
took
a
cigar
and
lighted
it
no
allan
he
finished
a
lord
would
make
a
hell
of
a
hit
anywhere
in
america
but
in
chicago
in
the
automobile
business
say
i
be
as
lonesome
and
deserted
as
the
of
an
elks
club
i
do
quite
understand
allan
began
no
said
george
turning
to
meet
minot
smile
but
this
gentleman
does
it
all
means
allan
that
there
nothing
doing
you
are
lord
harrowby
the
next
earl
of
raybrook
take
the
title
and
god
bless
you
but
george
allan
objected
legally
you
ca
do
worry
allan
said
the
man
from
chicago
there
nothing
we
ca
do
in
america
and
do
legally
how
this
i
always
been
intending
to
take
out
naturalization
papers
i
do
it
the
minute
i
get
back
to
chicago
and
then
the
title
is
yours
in
the
meantime
when
you
introduce
me
to
your
friends
here
we
just
pretend
taken
them
out
already
allan
harrowby
got
up
and
laid
his
hand
affectionately
on
his
shoulder
you
a
brick
old
boy
he
said
you
always
were
i
glad
to
be
here
for
the
wedding
how
did
you
happen
to
come
that
right
you
do
know
do
you
i
came
in
response
to
a
telegram
from
lloyds
of
new
york
from
er
lloyds
asked
allan
blankly
yes
allan
that
yacht
you
came
down
here
on
did
belong
to
martin
wall
it
belonged
to
me
he
made
away
with
it
from
north
river
because
he
happened
to
need
it
wall
a
crook
my
boy
the
your
ship
my
word
it
is
i
called
it
the
allan
lloyds
found
out
that
it
had
been
stolen
and
sent
me
a
wire
so
here
i
am
lloyds
found
out
through
me
minot
explained
to
the
dazed
allan
oh
i
beginning
to
see
said
allan
slowly
by
the
way
george
we
another
score
to
settle
with
wall
he
explained
briefly
how
wall
had
acquired
chain
lightning
collar
and
returned
a
duplicate
of
paste
in
its
place
the
elder
harrowby
listened
with
serious
face
it
no
doubt
the
collar
he
was
trailing
you
for
allan
he
said
and
that
how
he
came
to
need
the
yacht
but
when
finally
he
got
his
eager
fingers
on
those
diamonds
poor
old
wall
must
have
had
the
shock
of
his
life
how
that
it
was
wall
who
had
the
duplicate
made
it
was
father
years
ago
when
i
was
still
at
home
he
wanted
money
to
bet
as
usual
had
the
duplicate
made
risked
and
lost
but
allan
objected
he
gave
it
to
me
to
give
to
miss
meyrick
surely
he
would
have
done
that
how
old
is
he
now
allan
the
old
boy
must
be
a
little
childish
by
now
he
forgot
i
sure
he
forgot
that
the
only
view
to
take
of
it
a
silence
fell
in
a
moment
the
elder
brother
said
allan
i
want
you
to
assure
me
again
that
you
marrying
because
you
love
the
girl
and
for
no
other
reason
straight
george
allan
answered
and
looked
his
brother
in
the
eye
good
kid
there
nothing
in
the
other
kind
of
marriage
all
unhappiness
all
wrong
i
was
sure
you
must
be
on
the
level
but
you
see
after
thacker
the
insurance
chap
in
new
york
knew
who
i
was
and
that
i
would
take
the
title
he
told
me
about
that
fool
policy
you
took
out
no
did
he
all
about
it
sort
of
knocked
me
silly
for
a
minute
but
i
remembered
the
harrowby
gambling
streak
and
if
you
love
the
girl
and
really
want
to
marry
her
i
ca
see
any
harm
in
the
idea
however
i
hope
you
lose
out
on
the
policy
everything
now
nothing
in
the
way
not
a
thing
lord
harrowby
replied
minot
here
has
been
a
bully
help
worked
like
mad
to
put
the
wedding
through
i
owe
everything
to
him
insuring
a
woman
mind
reflected
george
harrowby
not
a
bad
idea
allan
almost
worthy
of
an
american
still
i
could
have
insured
you
myself
after
a
fashion
promised
you
a
good
job
as
manager
of
our
new
london
branch
in
case
the
marriage
fell
through
however
your
method
is
more
original
allan
harrowby
was
slowly
pacing
the
room
suddenly
he
turned
and
despite
the
fact
that
all
obstacles
were
removed
he
seemed
a
very
much
worried
young
man
george
minot
he
began
i
a
confession
to
make
it
about
that
policy
he
stopped
the
old
family
trouble
george
gamblers
to
the
bone
all
of
us
last
friday
night
at
the
manhattan
club
i
turned
over
that
policy
to
martin
wall
to
hold
as
security
for
a
five
thousand
dollar
loan
why
the
devil
did
you
do
that
minot
cried
well
and
allan
harrowby
was
in
his
old
state
of
helplessness
again
i
wanted
to
save
the
day
gonzale
was
hounding
us
for
money
i
thought
i
saw
a
chance
to
win
but
wall
wall
of
all
people
i
know
i
ought
to
have
done
it
knew
wall
was
altogether
straight
but
nobody
else
was
about
i
got
excited
borrowed
lost
the
whole
of
it
too
wha
what
are
we
going
to
do
he
looked
appealingly
at
minot
but
for
once
it
was
not
on
shoulders
that
the
responsibility
for
action
fell
george
harrowby
cheerfully
took
charge
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
going
out
to
the
yacht
with
an
officer
he
said
suppose
we
three
run
out
alone
and
talk
business
with
martin
wall
fifteen
minutes
later
the
two
harrowbys
and
minot
boarded
the
yacht
which
martin
wall
had
christened
the
george
harrowby
looked
about
him
with
interest
he
taken
very
good
care
of
it
i
say
that
for
him
he
remarked
martin
wall
came
suavely
forward
wall
said
minot
pleasantly
allow
me
to
present
george
harrowby
the
owner
of
the
boat
on
which
we
now
stand
i
beg
our
pardon
said
wall
without
the
quiver
of
an
eyelash
so
careless
of
me
do
stand
gentlemen
have
chairs
all
of
you
and
he
stared
george
harrowby
calmly
in
the
eye
you
flippant
this
morning
said
the
elder
harrowby
we
be
glad
to
sit
thank
you
and
may
i
repeat
what
minot
has
told
you
i
own
this
yacht
indeed
wall
face
beamed
you
bought
it
from
wilson
i
presume
just
who
is
wilson
why
he
the
man
i
rented
it
from
in
new
york
so
that
your
tale
is
it
allan
harrowby
put
in
you
wound
me
protested
wall
that
is
my
tale
as
you
call
it
i
rented
this
boat
in
new
york
from
a
man
named
albert
wilson
i
have
the
lease
to
show
you
also
my
receipt
for
one
month
rent
i
bet
you
have
commented
minot
bet
anything
you
like
you
come
from
a
betting
institution
i
believe
no
wall
i
did
not
buy
the
yacht
from
wilson
said
george
harrowby
i
owned
it
for
several
years
how
do
i
know
that
asked
martin
wall
glance
over
that
said
the
elder
harrowby
taking
a
paper
from
his
pocket
a
precaution
you
failed
to
take
with
albert
wilson
dear
dear
wall
looked
over
the
paper
and
handed
it
back
can
it
be
that
wilson
was
a
fraud
i
suggest
the
police
harrowby
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
testify
i
suggest
the
police
too
said
minot
hotly
for
martin
wall
if
you
thought
you
had
a
right
on
this
boat
wall
why
did
you
throw
me
overboard
into
the
north
river
when
i
mentioned
the
name
of
lloyds
wall
regarded
him
with
pained
surprise
i
threw
you
overboard
because
i
did
want
you
on
my
boat
he
said
i
thought
you
understood
that
fully
nonsense
minot
cried
you
stole
this
boat
by
bribing
the
caretaker
and
when
i
mentioned
lloyds
famous
the
world
over
as
a
marine
insurance
firm
you
thought
i
was
after
you
and
threw
me
over
the
rail
i
see
it
all
very
clearly
now
you
a
wise
young
man
wall
george
harrowby
broke
in
it
may
interest
you
to
know
that
we
do
believe
a
word
of
the
wilson
story
but
it
may
also
interest
you
to
know
that
i
am
willing
to
let
the
whole
matter
drop
on
one
condition
what
that
my
brother
allan
here
borrowed
five
thousand
dollars
from
you
the
other
night
and
gave
you
as
security
a
bit
of
paper
quite
worthless
to
any
one
save
himself
accept
my
check
for
five
thousand
and
hand
him
back
the
paper
wall
smiled
he
reached
into
his
inner
coat
pocket
with
the
greatest
pleasure
he
said
here
is
the
er
the
document
he
laughed
then
noting
the
check
book
on
the
elder
harrowby
knee
he
added
there
was
a
little
matter
of
interest
not
at
all
george
harrowby
looked
up
the
interest
is
forfeited
to
pay
wear
and
tear
on
this
yacht
for
a
moment
wall
showed
fight
but
he
did
not
much
care
for
the
light
he
saw
in
the
elder
harrowby
eyes
he
recognized
a
vast
difference
in
brothers
oh
very
well
he
said
the
check
was
written
and
the
exchange
made
since
you
are
convinced
i
am
the
owner
of
the
yacht
said
george
harrowby
rising
i
take
it
you
will
leave
it
at
once
as
soon
as
i
can
remove
my
belongings
wall
said
a
most
unfortunate
affair
all
round
a
fortunate
one
for
you
commented
minot
wall
glared
my
boy
he
said
angrily
did
any
one
ever
tell
you
you
were
a
jinx
never
smiled
minot
you
look
like
one
to
me
growled
martin
wall
george
harrowby
arranged
to
keep
the
crew
wall
had
engaged
in
order
to
get
the
back
to
new
york
it
was
thought
best
for
the
owner
to
stay
aboard
until
wall
had
gathered
his
property
and
departed
so
allan
harrowby
and
minot
alone
returned
to
san
marco
as
they
crossed
the
plaza
allan
said
by
gad
everything
looks
lovely
now
jenkins
out
of
the
way
good
old
george
the
title
the
policy
safe
in
my
pocket
not
a
thing
in
the
way
it
almost
too
good
to
be
true
replied
minot
with
a
very
mirthless
smile
it
must
be
a
great
relief
to
you
old
boy
you
have
worked
hard
must
feel
perfectly
jolly
over
all
this
me
said
minot
oh
i
can
hardly
contain
myself
for
joy
i
feel
like
twining
orange
blossoms
in
my
hair
he
walked
on
kicking
the
gravel
savagely
at
each
step
not
a
thing
in
the
way
now
not
a
single
solitary
hopeful
little
thing
chapter
xix
minot
goes
through
fire
the
duchess
of
lismore
elected
to
give
her
dinner
and
dance
in
miss
meyrick
honor
as
near
to
the
bright
florida
stars
as
she
could
on
the
top
floor
of
the
de
la
pax
was
a
private
only
partially
enclosed
with
a
picturesque
view
of
the
courtyard
below
adjacent
to
this
was
a
with
a
removable
glass
roof
and
this
the
duchess
had
ordered
transformed
into
a
ballroom
there
in
the
open
the
newest
society
dances
should
rise
to
offend
the
soft
southern
sky
being
a
good
general
the
hostess
was
early
on
the
scene
marshaling
her
forces
to
her
there
came
cynthia
meyrick
radiant
and
lovely
and
on
the
eve
of
her
wedding
how
sweet
you
look
cynthia
said
the
duchess
graciously
but
then
you
long
ago
solved
the
problem
of
what
becomes
you
i
have
to
look
as
sweet
as
i
can
replied
the
girl
wearily
all
the
rest
of
my
life
i
shall
have
to
try
and
live
up
to
the
nobility
she
sighed
to
think
remarked
the
duchess
busy
over
a
great
bowl
of
flowers
that
night
this
time
little
cynthia
will
be
lady
harrowby
i
suppose
you
go
to
rakedale
hall
for
part
of
the
year
at
least
i
suppose
so
i
too
have
had
my
rakedale
hall
formal
cynthia
dear
formal
nothing
but
silly
little
hunts
silly
little
shoots
american
men
would
die
there
as
for
american
women
nothing
ever
happens
the
hedges
bloom
in
neat
little
rows
the
trees
blossom
they
bare
again
cynthia
sometimes
i
been
in
a
state
where
i
give
ten
years
of
my
life
just
to
hear
the
rattle
of
an
elevated
train
she
stood
looking
down
at
the
girl
an
all
too
evident
pity
in
her
eyes
it
is
all
it
might
be
i
fancy
marrying
into
the
peerage
cynthia
said
my
dear
replied
the
duchess
i
nearly
died
at
times
i
never
was
exactly
what
you
call
a
patriot
but
often
i
waked
in
the
night
and
thought
of
detroit
my
little
car
rattling
over
the
cobblestones
a
new
gown
tried
on
at
madame
harbier
a
matinée
and
chocolate
afterward
at
that
little
place
you
remember
it
and
our
house
on
woodward
avenue
the
good
times
there
on
the
veranda
in
the
evening
and
jack
little
just
back
from
college
in
the
east
running
across
the
lawns
to
see
me
what
became
of
jack
dear
he
married
elise
perkins
ah
i
know
and
they
live
near
our
old
house
have
a
box
when
the
opera
comes
entertain
the
yale
glee
club
every
christmas
oh
cynthia
maybe
it
crude
maybe
it
in
english
eyes
but
home
when
you
introduced
that
brother
of
lord
harrowby
this
afternoon
that
big
splendid
chap
who
said
america
looked
better
than
a
title
to
him
i
could
have
thrown
my
arms
about
his
neck
and
kissed
him
she
came
closer
to
the
girl
and
stood
looking
down
at
her
with
infinite
tenderness
in
her
eyes
was
there
any
american
boy
my
dear
she
asked
i
i
hundreds
of
them
answered
cynthia
meyrick
trying
to
laugh
the
duchess
turned
away
it
wrong
of
me
to
discourage
you
like
that
she
said
marrying
into
the
peerage
is
something
after
all
you
must
come
home
every
year
insist
on
it
johnson
are
these
the
best
caviar
bowls
the
hotel
can
furnish
and
the
duchess
of
lismore
late
of
detroit
drifted
off
into
a
bitter
argument
with
the
humble
johnson
miss
meyrick
strolled
away
out
upon
a
little
balcony
opening
off
the
she
stood
gazing
down
at
the
waving
fronds
in
the
courtyard
six
stories
below
if
only
that
fountain
down
there
were
ponce
de
leon
but
it
was
she
must
put
youth
behind
she
must
go
far
from
the
country
she
loved
did
she
care
enough
for
that
strangely
enough
burning
tears
filled
her
eyes
hot
revolt
surged
into
her
heart
she
stood
looking
down
meanwhile
the
other
members
of
the
were
gathering
with
tender
solicitude
about
their
hostess
in
the
ballroom
beyond
dick
minot
hopeless
glum
stalked
moodily
among
them
into
the
crowd
drifted
jack
paddock
his
sprightly
air
noticeably
lacking
his
eyes
worried
dreadful
for
the
love
of
heaven
minot
asked
as
they
stepped
together
into
a
secluded
corner
what
ails
you
be
gentle
with
me
boy
said
paddock
unhappily
i
in
a
horrible
mess
the
graft
dick
the
good
old
graft
it
over
and
done
with
now
what
do
you
mean
it
happened
last
night
after
our
wild
chase
of
harrowby
i
was
fussed
excited
i
prepared
two
sets
of
repartee
for
my
two
customers
to
use
yes
i
always
make
carbon
copies
to
refer
to
myself
just
before
the
stuff
is
to
be
used
a
few
minutes
ago
i
took
out
my
copies
dick
i
sent
the
same
repartee
to
both
of
them
good
lord
good
lord
is
meek
and
futile
so
is
damn
put
on
your
little
rubber
coat
my
boy
i
predict
a
hurricane
in
spite
of
his
own
troubles
minot
laughed
mirth
eh
said
paddock
grimly
i
ca
see
it
that
way
i
be
as
popular
as
a
republican
in
texas
before
this
evening
is
over
got
a
couple
of
hasty
resignations
all
ready
thought
at
first
i
would
come
but
that
seemed
cowardly
anyway
this
is
my
last
appearance
on
any
stage
as
a
librettist
kindly
omit
flowers
and
paddock
drifted
gloomily
away
while
the
servants
were
passing
cocktails
on
gleaming
trays
minot
found
the
door
to
the
balcony
and
stepped
outside
a
white
wraith
flitted
from
the
shadows
to
his
side
minot
said
a
soft
scared
little
voice
ah
miss
meyrick
he
cried
merciful
fate
this
that
they
met
for
the
first
time
since
that
incident
on
the
ramparts
in
kindly
darkness
miss
meyrick
began
minot
hurriedly
i
very
glad
to
have
a
moment
alone
with
you
i
want
to
apologize
for
last
night
i
was
mad
i
did
harrowby
a
very
palpable
wrong
i
very
ashamed
of
myself
as
i
look
back
can
i
hope
that
you
will
forget
all
i
said
she
did
not
reply
but
stood
looking
down
at
the
palms
far
below
can
i
hope
that
you
will
forget
and
forgive
she
glanced
up
at
him
and
her
eyes
shone
in
the
dusk
i
can
forgive
she
said
softly
but
i
ca
forget
minot
yes
what
what
is
woman
greatest
privilege
something
in
the
tone
of
her
voice
sent
a
cold
chill
sweeping
through
minot
very
soul
he
clutched
the
rail
for
support
if
if
you
answer
said
the
girl
it
would
make
it
easier
for
aunt
mary
generous
form
appeared
in
the
doorway
oh
there
you
are
cynthia
you
are
keeping
the
duchess
dinner
waiting
cynthia
meyrick
joined
her
aunt
minot
stayed
behind
a
moment
below
him
florida
swam
in
the
azure
night
what
had
the
girl
been
about
to
say
pulling
himself
together
he
went
inside
and
learned
that
he
was
to
take
in
to
dinner
a
glorious
blond
bridesmaid
when
they
were
seated
he
found
that
miss
meyrick
face
was
hidden
from
him
by
a
profusion
of
florida
blossoms
he
was
glad
of
that
he
wanted
to
think
think
a
few
others
were
thinking
at
that
table
bruce
and
the
duchess
among
them
bruce
was
mentally
rehearsing
the
duchess
glanced
at
her
the
wittiest
woman
in
san
marco
thought
the
hostess
bah
paddock
meanwhile
was
toying
unhappily
with
his
food
he
had
little
to
say
the
attractive
young
lady
he
had
taken
in
had
already
classified
him
as
a
bore
most
unjust
of
the
attractive
young
lady
it
lamentable
really
bruce
was
speaking
even
in
our
best
society
conversation
has
given
way
to
the
turkey
trot
our
wits
are
in
our
feet
where
once
people
talked
art
music
literature
now
they
tango
madly
it
really
seems
everything
you
say
is
true
interrupted
the
duchess
blandly
i
sometimes
think
the
race
of
the
future
will
be
a
trotting
race
bruce
started
perceptibly
her
eyes
lighted
with
fire
she
had
been
working
up
to
this
line
herself
and
the
coincidence
was
passing
strange
she
glared
at
the
hostess
paddock
studied
his
plate
intently
i
for
one
went
on
the
duchess
of
lismore
do
not
dance
the
tango
or
the
turkey
trot
nor
am
i
willing
to
take
the
necessary
steps
to
learn
them
a
little
ripple
ran
round
the
table
the
ripple
that
up
to
now
had
been
the
exclusive
privilege
of
bruce
that
lady
paled
visibly
she
realized
that
there
was
no
coincidence
here
it
seems
too
bad
too
she
said
fixing
the
hostess
firmly
with
an
angry
eye
because
women
could
have
the
world
at
their
feet
if
they
only
keep
their
feet
still
long
enough
it
was
the
turn
of
the
duchess
to
start
and
start
she
did
as
one
who
could
not
believe
her
ears
she
stared
at
bruce
the
wittiest
hostess
in
san
marco
was
militantly
under
way
women
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
she
continued
either
they
are
mad
about
clothes
or
they
go
to
the
other
extreme
and
harbor
strange
ideas
about
the
vote
eugenics
what
not
in
fact
the
sex
reminds
me
of
the
type
of
shop
that
abounds
in
a
small
town
its
specialty
is
drygoods
and
notions
the
duchess
pushed
away
a
plate
which
had
only
that
moment
been
set
before
her
she
regarded
bruce
with
the
eye
of
pankhurst
face
to
face
with
a
prime
minister
we
are
hardly
kind
to
our
sex
she
said
but
i
must
say
i
agree
with
you
and
the
extravagance
of
women
half
the
women
of
my
acquaintance
wear
gorgeous
rings
on
their
fingers
while
their
husbands
wear
blue
rings
about
their
eyes
bruce
face
was
livid
madam
she
said
through
her
teeth
what
is
it
asked
the
duchess
sweetly
they
sat
glaring
at
each
other
then
with
one
accord
they
turned
to
glare
at
jack
paddock
paddock
prince
of
assurance
was
blushing
furiously
he
stood
the
combined
glare
as
long
as
he
could
then
he
looked
up
into
the
night
how
how
close
the
stars
seem
he
murmured
faintly
it
was
noted
afterward
that
bruce
maintained
a
vivid
silence
during
the
remainder
of
that
dinner
the
duchess
on
the
contrary
wrung
from
her
purchased
lines
every
possibility
they
held
and
in
that
embattled
setting
minot
sat
deaf
to
the
delicious
lisp
of
the
debutante
at
his
side
what
was
woman
greatest
privilege
was
it
his
forehead
grew
damp
his
knees
trembled
beneath
the
table
jephson
thacker
jephson
thacker
he
said
over
and
over
to
himself
after
dinner
when
the
added
guests
invited
by
the
duchess
for
the
dance
crowded
the
ballroom
minot
encountered
jack
paddock
paddock
was
limp
and
pitiable
ever
apologize
to
an
angry
woman
he
asked
ever
try
to
expostulate
with
a
storm
at
sea
i
had
it
out
with
bruce
offered
to
do
anything
to
atone
she
said
the
best
thing
i
could
do
would
be
to
disappear
from
san
marco
she
right
i
going
this
is
my
exit
from
the
butterfly
life
and
i
do
intend
to
say
to
the
duchess
either
i
wish
i
could
go
with
you
said
minot
sadly
well
come
along
no
i
i
stick
it
out
see
you
later
paddock
slipped
unostentatiously
away
in
the
direction
of
the
elevator
on
a
dais
hidden
by
palms
the
orchestra
began
to
play
softly
you
have
asked
to
see
my
card
said
cynthia
meyrick
at
side
he
smiled
a
wan
smile
and
wrote
his
name
opposite
number
five
she
drifted
away
the
music
became
louder
rising
to
the
bright
stars
themselves
the
dances
that
had
furnished
so
much
bitter
conversation
at
table
began
to
break
out
minot
hunted
up
the
balcony
and
stood
gazing
miserably
down
at
below
there
miss
meyrick
found
him
when
the
fifth
dance
was
imminent
is
it
customary
for
girls
to
pursue
their
partners
she
inquired
i
sorry
he
said
weakly
shall
we
go
in
it
so
so
glorious
out
here
he
sighed
a
sigh
of
resignation
he
turned
to
her
you
asked
me
what
is
woman
greatest
privilege
he
said
yes
is
it
to
change
her
mind
she
looked
timidly
into
his
eyes
it
is
she
whispered
faintly
the
most
miserably
happy
man
in
history
he
gasped
cynthia
it
too
late
you
to
be
married
do
you
mean
you
call
it
all
off
now
at
the
last
minute
she
nodded
her
head
her
eyes
on
the
ground
my
god
he
moaned
and
turned
away
it
would
be
all
wrong
to
marry
harrowby
she
said
faintly
because
i
come
to
i
oh
dick
ca
you
see
see
of
course
i
see
he
clenched
his
fists
cynthia
my
dearest
below
him
stretched
six
stories
of
open
space
in
his
agony
he
thought
of
leaping
over
the
rail
of
letting
that
be
his
answer
but
no
it
would
disarrange
things
so
it
might
even
postpone
the
wedding
cynthia
he
groaned
you
ca
understand
it
must
be
given
my
word
i
ca
explain
i
can
never
explain
but
cynthia
cynthia
back
in
the
shadow
the
girl
pressed
her
hands
to
her
burning
cheeks
a
strange
love
yours
she
said
a
love
that
blows
hot
and
cold
cynthia
that
is
true
i
do
love
you
please
please
let
us
forget
she
stepped
into
the
moonlight
fine
brave
smiling
do
we
dance
cynthia
he
cried
unhappily
if
you
only
understood
i
think
i
do
the
music
has
stopped
harrowby
has
the
next
dance
he
hardly
think
of
looking
for
me
here
she
was
gone
minot
stood
alone
on
the
balcony
he
was
dazed
blind
trembling
he
had
refused
the
girl
without
whom
life
could
never
be
worth
while
refused
her
to
keep
the
faith
he
entered
upon
the
bright
scene
inside
slipped
unnoticed
to
the
elevator
and
still
dazed
descended
to
the
lobby
he
would
walk
in
the
moonlight
until
his
senses
were
regained
near
the
main
door
of
the
de
la
pax
he
ran
into
henry
trimmer
mr
trimmer
had
a
newspaper
in
his
hand
what
the
matter
with
the
women
nowadays
he
demanded
indignantly
minot
tried
in
vain
to
push
by
him
seen
what
those
london
suffragettes
have
done
now
and
trimmer
pointed
to
a
what
have
they
done
asked
minot
done
they
put
dynamite
under
the
statue
of
lord
nelson
in
trafalgar
square
and
blew
it
it
fell
over
into
the
strand
good
cried
minot
wildly
good
i
hope
to
hell
it
smashed
the
whole
of
london
and
brushing
aside
the
startled
trimmer
he
went
out
into
the
night
it
was
nearly
twelve
when
minot
somewhat
calmer
of
mind
returned
to
the
de
la
pax
as
he
stepped
into
the
courtyard
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
crowd
gathered
before
the
hotel
then
he
noticed
that
from
a
window
poured
smoke
and
flame
and
that
the
town
fire
department
was
wildly
getting
into
action
he
stopped
his
heart
almost
ceased
beating
that
was
her
window
the
window
to
which
he
had
called
her
on
that
night
that
seemed
so
far
away
last
night
breathlessly
he
ran
forward
and
he
ran
straight
into
a
group
just
descended
from
the
ballroom
of
that
group
cynthia
meyrick
was
a
member
for
a
moment
they
stood
gazing
at
each
other
then
the
girl
turned
to
her
aunt
my
wedding
dress
she
cried
i
left
it
lying
on
my
bed
oh
i
ca
possibly
be
married
if
that
is
burned
there
was
a
challenge
in
that
last
sentence
and
the
young
man
for
whom
it
was
intended
did
not
miss
it
mad
with
the
injustice
of
life
he
swooped
down
on
a
fireman
struggling
with
a
wabbly
ladder
snatching
away
the
ladder
he
placed
it
against
the
window
from
which
the
smoke
and
flame
poured
he
ran
up
it
here
shouted
the
chief
of
the
fire
department
laying
angry
hands
on
the
ladder
base
wot
you
doing
you
ca
go
in
there
why
the
devil
ca
i
bellowed
minot
let
go
of
that
ladder
he
plunged
into
the
room
the
smoke
filled
his
nostrils
and
choked
him
his
eyes
burned
he
staggered
through
the
smoky
dusk
into
another
room
his
hands
met
the
brass
bars
of
a
bed
then
closed
over
something
soft
and
filmy
that
lay
upon
it
he
seized
the
something
close
and
hurried
back
into
the
other
room
a
fireman
at
another
window
sought
to
turn
a
stream
of
water
on
him
water
on
that
gown
cut
that
out
you
fool
minot
shouted
the
fireman
who
had
suspected
himself
of
saving
a
human
life
looked
hurt
minot
regained
his
window
disheveled
smoky
but
victorious
he
half
fell
half
climbed
to
the
ground
the
fire
chief
faced
him
who
was
you
trying
to
rescue
the
chief
demanded
his
eyes
grew
wide
you
idiot
he
roared
they
ai
nobody
in
that
dress
damn
it
i
know
that
minot
cried
he
ran
across
the
lawn
and
stood
a
panting
limp
battered
ludicrous
figure
before
cynthia
meyrick
i
i
hope
it
the
right
one
he
said
and
held
out
the
gown
she
took
his
offering
and
came
very
close
to
him
i
hate
you
she
said
in
a
low
tone
i
hate
you
i
i
was
afraid
you
would
he
muttered
a
shout
from
the
firemen
announced
that
the
blaze
was
under
control
to
his
dismay
minot
saw
that
an
admiring
crowd
was
surrounding
him
he
broke
away
and
hurried
to
his
room
cynthia
meyrick
final
words
to
him
rang
in
his
ears
savagely
he
tore
at
his
ruined
collar
was
this
ridiculous
farce
never
to
end
as
if
in
answer
a
distant
clock
struck
twelve
he
shuddered
at
high
noon
chapter
xx
please
kill
early
tuesday
morning
while
minot
still
slept
and
mercifully
forgot
two
very
wide
awake
gentlemen
sat
alone
together
in
the
office
of
the
marco
one
was
manuel
gonzale
proprietor
of
that
paper
as
immaculate
as
the
morn
the
other
was
that
broad
and
breezy
gentleman
known
in
his
present
incarnation
as
martin
wall
very
neat
very
neat
indeed
said
wall
gazing
with
evident
approval
at
an
inky
smelling
sheet
that
lay
before
him
it
ought
to
do
the
work
if
it
does
it
will
be
the
first
stroke
of
luck
i
had
in
san
marco
gonzale
smiled
revealing
two
even
rows
of
very
white
teeth
you
do
not
like
san
marco
he
ventured
wall
snorted
angrily
like
it
does
a
beheaded
man
like
the
ax
in
a
long
and
golden
professional
career
i
never
struck
anything
like
this
town
before
for
hard
luck
i
not
in
it
hours
when
i
left
alone
my
hands
tied
with
stuff
enough
to
make
your
eyes
pop
out
of
your
head
that
pleasant
then
after
spending
two
months
and
a
lot
of
money
trailing
lord
harrowby
for
the
family
jools
i
finally
cop
them
i
give
the
crew
of
my
borrowed
boat
orders
to
steam
far
far
away
and
run
to
my
cabin
to
gloat
do
i
gloat
ask
me
i
do
not
gloat
i
find
the
famous
chain
lightning
collar
is
a
very
superior
collection
of
glass
worth
about
cents
i
send
back
the
glass
and
stick
around
hoping
for
better
days
and
the
best
i
get
is
a
call
from
the
owner
of
my
yacht
with
orders
to
vacate
at
once
when
i
first
came
here
i
swore
i
visit
that
jewelry
store
again
alone
but
there
a
jinx
after
me
in
this
town
what
the
use
i
going
to
get
out
but
before
you
go
smiled
manuel
one
stroke
of
luck
you
shall
have
maybe
i
leave
that
to
you
this
kind
of
thing
he
motioned
toward
the
damp
paper
is
not
in
my
line
he
bent
over
a
picture
on
the
front
page
that
cut
came
out
pretty
well
did
it
lucky
we
got
the
photograph
before
big
brother
george
arrived
i
have
always
found
san
marco
lucky
replied
gonzale
always
with
one
trifling
exception
he
drummed
reminiscently
on
his
desk
i
say
who
this
wall
pointed
to
a
line
just
beneath
the
name
of
the
paper
robert
editor
and
proprietor
he
read
manuel
gonzale
gurgled
softly
somewhere
within
which
was
his
cunning
way
of
indicating
mirth
ah
my
very
virtuous
managing
editor
he
said
one
of
those
dogs
who
dealt
so
vilely
with
me
i
have
told
you
of
that
manuel
gonzale
does
not
forget
he
leaned
closer
this
morning
at
two
after
and
howe
had
sent
paper
to
press
as
usual
luypas
my
circulation
manager
and
i
arrived
my
virtuous
editors
had
departed
to
their
rest
luypas
and
i
stopped
the
presses
we
substituted
a
new
form
and
howe
they
will
not
know
always
they
sleep
until
noon
in
this
balmy
climate
it
is
easy
to
lie
abed
again
manuel
gonzale
gurgled
may
their
sleep
be
dreamless
he
said
and
should
our
work
of
the
morning
fail
may
the
name
of
be
the
first
to
concern
the
police
wall
laughed
a
good
idea
he
remarked
he
looked
at
his
watch
the
banks
ought
to
be
open
now
gonzale
got
to
his
feet
carefully
he
folded
the
page
that
had
been
lying
on
his
desk
the
moment
for
action
has
come
he
said
shall
we
go
down
to
the
street
i
in
strange
waters
responded
martin
wall
uneasily
the
first
dip
i
ever
taken
out
of
my
line
do
believe
in
it
either
a
man
should
have
his
specialty
and
stick
to
it
however
i
need
the
money
am
i
letter
perfect
in
my
part
i
wonder
the
door
of
the
office
opened
and
a
sly
little
cuban
with
an
evil
face
stepped
in
ah
luypas
gonzale
said
you
are
here
at
last
do
you
understand
your
boys
they
are
to
be
in
the
next
room
yes
you
are
to
sit
near
that
telephone
at
a
word
from
my
friend
martin
wall
edition
of
the
is
to
flood
the
streets
the
instantly
delay
might
be
fatal
is
that
clear
i
know
said
luypas
very
good
said
gonzale
he
turned
to
martin
wall
now
is
the
time
he
added
the
two
descended
to
the
street
opposite
the
hotel
de
la
pax
they
parted
the
sleek
little
spaniard
went
on
alone
and
mounted
boldly
those
pretentious
steps
at
the
desk
he
informed
the
clerk
on
duty
that
he
must
see
spencer
meyrick
at
once
but
meyrick
is
very
busy
the
clerk
objected
say
this
is
life
and
death
replied
gonzale
and
the
clerk
wilting
telephoned
the
millionaire
apartments
for
nearly
an
hour
gonzale
was
kept
waiting
nervously
he
paced
the
lobby
consuming
one
cigarette
after
another
glancing
often
at
his
watch
finally
spencer
meyrick
appeared
pompous
a
hard
man
to
handle
as
he
always
had
been
the
spaniard
noted
this
and
his
slits
of
eyes
grew
even
narrower
will
you
come
with
me
he
asked
suavely
it
is
most
important
he
led
the
way
to
a
in
a
far
forgotten
corner
of
the
hotel
grounds
protesting
spencer
meyrick
followed
the
two
sat
down
i
have
something
to
show
you
said
gonzale
politely
and
removed
from
his
pocket
a
copy
of
the
marco
still
damp
from
the
presses
spencer
meyrick
took
the
paper
in
his
own
large
capable
hands
he
glanced
casually
at
the
first
page
and
his
face
grew
somewhat
redder
than
its
wont
a
huge
was
responsible
harrowby
was
taking
any
chances
underneath
in
slightly
smaller
type
spencer
meyrick
read
remarkable
foresight
of
english
fortune
hunter
who
weds
miss
meyrick
took
out
a
policy
for
thousand
pounds
with
lloyds
same
to
be
payable
in
case
the
beautiful
heiress
suffered
a
change
of
heart
prominent
on
the
page
was
a
large
photograph
which
purported
to
be
an
exact
facsimile
of
the
policy
meyrick
examined
it
he
glanced
through
the
story
which
happened
to
be
commendably
brief
he
told
himself
he
must
remain
calm
avoid
fireworks
think
quickly
laying
the
paper
on
his
knee
he
turned
to
the
little
man
beside
him
what
trick
is
this
he
asked
sharply
it
is
no
trick
sir
said
gonzale
pleasantly
it
is
the
truth
that
is
a
photograph
of
the
policy
old
meyrick
studied
the
cut
again
i
be
damned
he
remarked
i
have
no
desire
to
annoy
gonzale
went
on
but
there
are
five
thousand
copies
of
at
the
office
ready
to
be
distributed
at
a
signal
from
me
think
sir
newsboys
on
the
street
with
that
story
at
the
very
moment
when
your
daughter
becomes
lady
harrowby
i
see
said
meyrick
slowly
blackmail
manuel
gonzale
shuddered
in
horror
oh
i
beg
of
you
he
protested
that
is
hardly
it
a
business
proposition
i
should
call
it
it
happens
that
the
men
back
of
the
star
publishing
company
which
issues
the
have
grown
tired
of
the
newspaper
game
in
san
marco
they
are
desirous
of
closing
out
the
plant
at
once
say
this
morning
it
occurs
to
them
that
you
might
be
very
glad
to
purchase
the
before
the
next
edition
goes
on
the
street
you
a
clever
little
dog
said
meyrick
through
his
teeth
you
are
not
exactly
complimentary
however
let
us
say
for
the
argument
you
buy
the
at
once
i
am
by
the
way
empowered
to
make
the
sale
you
take
charge
you
hurry
to
the
office
you
destroy
all
copies
of
issue
so
far
printed
you
give
orders
to
the
to
kill
this
story
good
as
it
is
kill
you
say
a
term
with
newspaper
men
you
call
yourself
a
newspaper
man
why
not
the
story
is
killed
another
is
put
in
its
place
say
for
example
an
elaborate
account
of
your
daughter
wedding
and
in
its
changed
form
the
your
newspaper
goes
on
the
street
um
and
your
price
it
is
a
valuable
property
especially
valuable
this
morning
i
take
it
sneered
meyrick
valuable
at
any
time
our
presses
cost
a
thousand
our
linotypes
two
thousand
and
there
is
that
other
thing
so
hard
to
estimate
definitely
the
wide
appeal
of
our
paper
the
price
well
fifteen
thousand
dollars
extremely
reasonable
and
i
will
include
the
good
will
of
the
retiring
management
you
contemptible
little
began
spencer
meyrick
my
dear
sir
control
yourself
pleaded
gonzale
or
i
may
be
unable
to
include
the
good
will
i
spoke
of
would
you
care
to
see
that
story
on
the
streets
you
may
at
any
moment
there
is
but
one
way
out
buy
the
newspaper
buy
it
now
here
is
the
plan
you
go
with
me
to
your
bank
you
procure
fifteen
thousand
in
cash
we
go
together
to
the
office
you
pay
me
the
money
and
i
leave
you
in
charge
old
meyrick
leaped
to
his
feet
very
good
he
cried
come
on
one
thing
more
continued
the
crafty
gonzale
it
may
pay
you
to
note
we
are
watched
even
now
all
the
way
to
the
bank
and
thence
to
the
office
of
the
we
will
be
watched
should
any
accident
now
unforeseen
happen
to
me
that
issue
of
the
will
go
on
sale
in
five
minutes
all
over
san
marco
spencer
meyrick
stood
glaring
down
at
the
little
man
in
white
his
enthusiasm
of
a
moment
ago
for
the
journey
vanished
however
the
of
the
were
staring
up
at
him
from
the
bench
he
stooped
pocketed
the
paper
and
growled
i
understand
come
on
there
must
be
some
escape
the
trap
seemed
absurdly
simple
across
the
hotel
lawn
down
the
hot
avenue
in
the
less
hot
plaza
meyrick
sought
a
way
a
naturally
impulsive
man
he
had
difficulty
restraining
himself
but
he
thought
of
his
daughter
whose
happiness
was
more
than
money
in
his
eyes
no
way
offered
at
the
counter
of
the
tiny
bank
meyrick
stood
writing
his
check
gonzale
at
his
elbow
suddenly
behind
them
the
screen
door
slammed
and
a
man
with
flaming
red
hair
rushed
in
what
is
it
you
want
gonzale
screamed
out
of
my
way
don
quixote
cried
the
one
i
a
windmill
and
my
arms
breathe
death
are
you
meyrick
well
tear
up
that
check
gladly
said
meyrick
only
notice
the
catbirds
down
here
went
on
the
wild
one
noisy
little
beasts
are
they
well
after
this
take
off
your
hat
to
a
catbird
saved
you
a
lot
of
money
this
morning
i
afraid
i
do
follow
said
the
dazed
spencer
meyrick
no
i
explain
i
have
been
working
on
this
man
paper
for
the
last
week
so
has
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
we
knew
he
was
crooked
but
we
needed
the
money
and
he
promised
us
not
to
pull
off
any
more
blackmail
while
we
stayed
last
night
after
we
left

gonzale

the
millionaire

street
just
as
well
commented
meyrick
i
should
not
have
cared
to
cause

it
would
have
meant
publicity
he
laid
a
hand
on

he
said
that

laughed
and
they
parted

to
the

before
the
lanky
howe
in

of
time
he
cried

meanwhile
in
a
corner
of
the

manuel

spoke
sad
words
in
the
ear
of

alas
i

wherewithal
to

me
in
the
style
to
which
my
victims

porto

suggested
gonzale
the

is
mild
so
are
the
police
i
will
stake
you
thanks
porto
rico
it
is
how
the
devil
do
we
get
there
up
the
main
avenue
of
san
marco
spencer
meyrick
walked
as
a
man
going
to
avenge
with
every
determined
step
his
face
grew
redder
his
eye
more
dangerous
he
looked
at
his
watch
eleven
the
eleventh
hour
but
much
might
happen
between
the
eleventh
hour
and
high
noon
chapter
xxi
high
words
at
high
noon
in
the
harrowby
suite
the
holder
of
the
title
a
handsome
and
distinguished
figure
adorned
for
his
wedding
walked
nervously
the
rather
worn
carpet
his
brother
hastily
pressed
into
service
as
best
man
sat
puffing
at
a
cigar
with
a
persistency
which
indicated
a
somewhat
perturbed
state
of
mind
on
his
own
part
brace
up
allan
he
urged
it
be
over
before
you
realize
it
remember
my
own
wedding
gad
was
i
frightened
always
that
way
with
a
man
no
sense
to
it
but
he
just
ca
help
it
never
forget
that
little
parlor
with
the
flower
of
marion
society
all
about
and
me
with
my
teeth
chattering
and
my
knees
knocking
together
it
is
a
bit
of
an
ordeal
said
allan
weakly
chap
feels
all
sort
of
gone
inside
the
telephone
ringing
sharply
interrupted
george
harrowby
rose
and
stepped
to
it
allan
you
wish
allan
very
well
i
tell
him
he
turned
away
from
the
telephone
and
faced
his
brother
it
was
old
meyrick
kid
seemed
somewhat
hot
under
the
collar
wants
to
see
you
in
their
suite
at
once
wha
what
do
you
imagine
he
wants
going
to
make
you
a
present
of
riverside
drive
i
fancy
go
ahead
boy
i
wait
for
you
here
allan
harrowby
went
out
along
the
dusky
corridor
to
the
meyrick
door
not
without
misgivings
he
knocked
a
voice
boomed
come
he
pushed
open
the
door
he
saw
spencer
meyrick
sitting
purple
at
a
table
and
beside
him
cynthia
meyrick
in
the
loveliest
gown
of
all
the
lovely
gowns
she
had
ever
worn
the
beauty
of
the
girl
staggered
harrowby
a
bit
never
demonstrative
he
had
a
sudden
feeling
that
he
should
be
at
her
feet
you
you
sent
for
me
he
asked
coming
into
the
room
as
he
moved
closer
to
the
girl
he
was
to
marry
he
saw
that
her
face
was
whiter
than
her
gown
and
her
brown
eyes
strained
and
miserable
we
did
said
meyrick
rising
he
held
out
a
paper
will
you
please
look
at
that
his
lordship
took
the
sheet
in
unsteady
hands
he
glanced
down
slowly
the
meaning
of
the
story
that
met
his
gaze
filtered
through
his
dazed
brain
martin
wall
did
this
he
thought
to
himself
he
tried
to
speak
but
could
not
dumbly
he
stared
at
spencer
meyrick
we
want
no
scene
harrowby
said
the
old
man
wearily
we
merely
want
to
know
if
there
is
in
existence
a
policy
such
as
the
one
mentioned
here
the
paper
slipped
from
his
lordship
lifeless
hands
he
turned
miserably
away
not
daring
to
face
either
father
or
daughter
he
answered
very
faintly
there
is
spencer
meyrick
sighed
that
all
we
want
to
know
there
will
be
no
wedding
harrowby
wha
what
his
lordship
faced
about
why
sir
the
guests
must
be
it
is
unfortunate
but
there
will
be
no
wedding
the
old
man
turned
to
his
daughter
cynthia
he
asked
have
you
nothing
to
say
yes
white
trembling
the
girl
faced
his
lordship
it
seems
allan
that
you
have
regarded
our
marriage
as
a
business
proposition
you
have
gambled
on
the
stability
of
the
market
well
you
win
i
have
changed
my
mind
this
is
final
i
shall
not
change
it
again
cynthia
and
any
who
had
considered
lord
harrowby
unfeeling
must
have
been
surprised
at
the
anguish
in
his
voice
i
have
loved
you
i
love
you
now
i
adore
you
what
can
i
say
in
explanation
of
this
we
gamble
all
of
us
it
is
a
passion
bred
in
the
family
that
is
why
i
took
out
this
absurd
policy
my
dearest
it
does
mean
that
there
was
no
love
on
my
side
there
is
there
always
will
be
whatever
happens
ca
you
understand
the
girl
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
and
drew
him
away
to
the
window
it
no
use
allan
she
said
for
his
ears
alone
perhaps
i
could
have
forgiven
but
somehow
i
do
care
as
i
thought
i
did
it
is
better
embarrassing
as
it
may
be
for
us
both
that
there
should
be
no
wedding
after
all
cynthia
you
ca
mean
that
you
do
believe
me
let
me
send
for
my
brother
he
will
tell
you
of
the
passion
for
gambling
in
our
family
he
will
tell
you
that
i
love
you
too
he
moved
toward
the
telephone
no
use
said
cynthia
meyrick
shaking
her
head
it
would
only
prolong
a
painful
scene
please
do
allan
i
send
for
minot
too
harrowby
cried
mr
minot
the
girl
eyes
narrowed
and
what
has
minot
to
do
with
this
everything
he
came
down
here
as
the
representative
of
lloyds
he
came
down
to
make
sure
that
you
did
change
your
mind
he
will
tell
you
that
i
love
you
a
queer
expression
hovered
about
miss
meyrick
lips
spencer
meyrick
interrupted
nonsense
he
cried
there
is
no
need
to
one
moment
cynthia
meyrick
eyes
shone
strangely
send
for
your
brother
allan
and
for
mr
minot
harrowby
stepped
to
the
telephone
he
summoned
his
forces
a
strained
unhappy
silence
ensued
then
the
two
men
entered
the
room
together
minot
george
old
boy
lord
harrowby
said
helplessly
miss
meyrick
and
her
father
have
discovered
the
existence
of
a
certain
insurance
policy
about
which
you
both
know
they
have
believed
that
my
motive
in
seeking
a
marriage
was
purely
mercenary
that
my
affection
for
the
girl
who
is
was
to
have
become
my
wife
can
not
be
sincere
they
are
wrong
quite
wrong
both
of
you
know
that
i
sent
for
you
to
help
me
make
them
understand
i
can
not
george
harrowby
stepped
forward
and
smiled
his
kindly
smile
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
i
regret
that
policy
very
deeply
when
i
first
heard
of
it
i
too
suspected
allan
motives
but
after
i
talked
with
him
after
i
saw
you
i
was
convinced
that
his
affection
for
you
was
most
sincere
i
thought
back
to
the
gambling
schemes
for
which
the
family
has
been
noted
i
saw
it
was
the
old
passion
cropping
out
anew
in
allan
that
he
was
really
not
to
blame
that
beyond
any
question
he
was
quite
devoted
to
you
otherwise
i
have
done
everything
in
my
power
to
prevent
the
wedding
yes
miss
meyrick
eyes
flashed
dangerously
and
your
other
witness
allan
the
soul
of
the
other
witness
squirmed
in
agony
this
was
too
much
too
much
you
minot
pleaded
harrowby
you
have
understood
i
have
felt
that
you
were
sincerely
fond
of
miss
meyrick
minot
replied
otherwise
i
should
not
have
done
what
i
have
done
then
minot
the
girl
inquired
you
think
i
would
be
wrong
to
give
up
all
plans
for
the
wedding
i
i
yes
i
do
writhed
minot
and
you
advise
me
to
marry
lord
harrowby
at
once
minot
passed
his
handkerchief
over
his
damp
forehead
had
the
girl
no
mercy
i
do
he
answered
miserably
cynthia
meyrick
laughed
harshly
mirthlessly
because
that
your
business
your
mean
little
business
she
said
scornfully
i
know
at
last
why
you
came
to
san
marco
i
understand
everything
you
had
gambled
with
lord
harrowby
and
you
came
here
to
see
that
you
did
not
lose
your
money
well
you
lost
carry
that
news
back
to
the
concern
you
work
for
in
spite
of
your
heroic
efforts
you
lost
at
the
last
moment
cynthia
meyrick
changed
her
mind
lost
the
word
cut
minot
to
the
quick
lost
indeed
lost
stake
lost
the
girl
he
loved
he
had
failed
jephson
failed
himself
after
all
he
had
done
all
he
had
sacrificed
a
double
defeat
and
therefore
doubly
bitter
cynthia
surely
you
do
mean
lord
harrowby
was
pleading
i
do
allan
said
the
girl
more
gently
it
was
true
what
i
told
you
there
by
the
window
it
is
better
father
will
you
go
down
and
say
i
not
to
be
married
after
all
spencer
meyrick
nodded
and
turned
toward
the
door
cynthia
cried
harrowby
brokenly
there
was
no
reply
old
meyrick
went
out
i
sorry
his
lordship
said
sorry
i
made
such
a
mess
of
it
the
more
so
because
i
love
you
cynthia
and
always
shall
he
held
out
his
hand
she
put
hers
in
it
it
too
bad
allan
she
said
but
it
was
to
be
and
even
now
you
have
one
consolation
the
money
that
lloyds
must
pay
you
the
money
means
nothing
cynthia
miss
meyrick
is
mistaken
minot
interrupted
lord
harrowby
has
not
even
that
consolation
lloyds
owes
him
nothing
why
not
asked
the
girl
defiantly
up
to
an
hour
ago
said
minot
you
were
determined
to
marry
his
lordship
i
should
hardly
put
it
that
way
but
i
intended
to
yes
then
you
changed
your
mind
why
i
changed
it
because
i
found
out
about
this
ridiculous
this
insulting
policy
then
his
lordship
taking
out
of
the
policy
caused
the
calling
off
of
the
wedding
y
yes
why
it
may
interest
you
to
know
and
it
may
interest
lord
harrowby
to
recall
that
five
minutes
before
he
took
out
this
policy
he
signed
an
agreement
to
do
everything
in
his
power
to
bring
about
the
wedding
and
he
further
promised
that
if
the
wedding
should
be
called
off
because
of
any
subsequent
act
of
his
he
would
forfeit
the
premium
by
gad
said
lord
harrowby
the
taking
out
of
the
policy
was
a
subsequent
act
continued
minot
the
premium
i
fancy
is
forfeited
he
got
you
allan
said
george
harrowby
coming
forward
and
i
for
one
ca
say
i
sorry
you
going
to
tear
up
that
policy
now
and
go
to
work
for
me
i
for
one
am
sorry
cried
miss
meyrick
her
flashing
eyes
on
minot
i
wanted
you
to
win
allan
i
wanted
you
to
win
why
minot
asked
innocently
you
ought
to
know
she
answered
and
turned
away
lord
harrowby
moved
toward
the
door
we
not
hard
losers
he
said
blankly
but
gone
it
a
bit
of
a
cynthia
allan
and
good
luck
thanks
and
harrowby
went
out
with
his
brother
minot
stood
for
a
time
not
daring
to
move
cynthia
meyrick
was
at
the
window
her
scornful
back
was
not
encouraging
finally
she
turned
saw
minot
and
gave
a
start
of
surprise
oh
you
still
here
cynthia
now
you
understand
he
said
you
know
why
i
acted
as
i
did
you
realize
my
position
i
was
in
a
horrible
fix
she
looked
at
him
coldly
yes
she
said
i
do
understand
you
were
gambling
on
me
you
came
down
here
to
defend
your
employer
cash
well
you
have
succeeded
is
there
anything
more
to
be
said
is
there
on
the
ramparts
of
the
old
fort
the
other
night
please
do
not
make
yourself
any
more
ridiculous
than
is
necessary
you
have
put
your
employer
money
above
my
happiness
always
really
you
looked
rather
cheap
with
your
sanctimonious
advice
that
i
marry
harrowby
are
you
beginning
to
realize
your
own
position
the
silly
childish
figure
you
cut
then
you
last
night
when
you
came
staggering
across
the
lawn
to
me
with
this
foolish
gown
in
your
arms
i
told
you
i
hated
you
do
you
imagine
i
hate
you
any
less
now
well
i
do
her
voice
became
tearful
i
hate
you
i
hate
you
but
some
day
she
turned
away
from
him
for
she
was
sobbing
outright
now
i
never
want
to
see
you
again
as
long
as
i
live
she
cried
never
never
never
limp
pitiable
worn
by
the
long
fight
he
had
waged
minot
stood
staring
helplessly
at
her
heaving
shoulders
then
i
can
only
say
i
sorry
he
murmured
and
he
waited
she
did
not
turn
toward
him
he
stumbled
out
of
the
room
chapter
xxii
well
hardly
ever
minot
went
below
and
sent
two
messages
one
to
jephson
the
other
to
thacker
the
lobby
of
the
de
la
pax
was
thronged
with
brilliantly
attired
wedding
guests
who
metaphorically
beat
their
breasts
in
perplexity
over
the
tidings
that
had
come
even
as
they
craned
their
necks
to
catch
the
first
glimpse
of
that
distinguished
bridal
party
the
lavishly
decorated
parlor
that
was
to
have
been
the
scene
of
the
ceremony
stood
tragically
deserted
minot
cast
one
look
at
it
and
hurried
again
to
his
own
particular
cell
he
took
a
couple
of
from
his
desk
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
facing
the
window
all
over
now
nothing
to
do
but
return
to
the
north
as
fast
as
the
trains
would
take
him
he
had
won
but
he
had
also
lost
he
felt
listless
weary
he
let
the
fall
to
the
floor
and
sat
gazing
out
at
that
narrow
street
thinking
wondering
wishing
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
the
clamor
of
his
telephone
recalled
him
to
himself
he
leaped
up
and
seized
the
receiver
allan
harrowby
voice
came
over
the
wire
can
you
run
down
to
the
room
minot
he
inquired
the
last
call
old
boy
minot
went
he
found
both
the
harrowbys
there
prepared
to
say
to
san
marco
forever
going
to
new
york
on
the
said
george
harrowby
who
was
aggressively
cheerful
from
there
i
taking
allan
to
chicago
going
to
have
him
reading
george
ade
and
talking
our
language
in
a
week
lord
harrowby
smiled
wanly
nothing
left
but
chicago
he
drawled
i
wanted
to
see
you
before
i
went
minot
old
chap
not
that
i
can
thank
you
for
all
you
did
i
do
know
how
you
stood
by
me
like
like
a
gentleman
and
i
realize
that
i
have
no
claim
on
lloyds
it
was
all
my
fault
if
i
never
let
martin
wall
have
that
confounded
policy
but
what
the
use
of
all
my
fault
and
my
thanks
old
boy
he
sighed
nonsense
said
minot
a
business
proposition
solely
from
my
point
of
view
there
no
thanks
coming
to
me
it
seems
to
me
said
george
harrowby
that
as
the
only
victor
in
this
affair
you
do
exhibit
a
proper
cheerfulness
by
the
way
be
delighted
to
take
you
north
on
our
boat
why
not
but
minot
shook
his
head
ca
spare
the
time
thank
you
just
the
same
he
replied
i
like
nothing
better
amid
expressions
of
regret
the
harrowbys
started
for
the
elevator
minot
walked
along
the
dusky
corridor
with
them
we
had
a
bit
of
excitement
what
said
allan
if
you
ever
in
london
you
to
be
my
guest
old
george
has
some
sort
of
a
berth
for
me
over
there
not
a
berth
allan
objected
george
pressing
the
button
for
the
elevator
you
not
going
to
sleep
a
job
might
as
well
begin
to
talk
the
chicago
language
now
minot
i
too
want
to
thank
you
they
stepped
into
the
elevator
the
door
slammed
the
car
began
to
descend
minot
stood
gazing
through
the
iron
scroll
work
until
the
blond
head
of
the
helpless
lord
harrowby
moved
finally
out
of
sight
then
he
returned
to
his
room
and
the
which
seemed
such
dull
unhappy
reading
jack
paddock
appeared
to
invite
minot
to
take
dinner
with
him
his
bags
he
remarked
were
all
packed
and
he
was
booked
for
the
seven
train
i
slipped
down
the
mountain
of
gold
he
said
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
but
all
good
things
must
end
and
i
certainly
had
a
good
thing
somehow
i
not
so
gloomy
as
i
ought
to
be
where
are
you
going
jack
minot
asked
paddock
leaned
over
confidentially
did
i
say
her
father
was
in
the
plumbing
business
he
inquired
my
error
dick
he
owns
a
newspaper
out
in
grand
rapids
offered
me
a
job
any
time
i
wanted
it
great
joke
then
pretty
serious
now
for
i
going
out
to
apply
i
glad
of
it
so
am
i
dick
i
was
a
fool
to
let
her
go
back
like
that
been
thinking
it
all
over
and
over
one
girl
in
how
many
are
there
in
the
world
should
you
say
the
other
day
i
had
a
chill
it
occurred
to
me
maybe
she
gone
and
married
the
young
man
with
the
pale
purple
necktie
who
passes
the
plate
in
the
methodist
church
so
i
beat
it
to
the
telegraph
counter
and
she
heart
whole
and
fancy
free
in
both
respects
so
it
me
for
grand
rapids
and
say
dick
i
er
i
want
you
to
know
i
sent
that
telegram
before
the
accident
last
night
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
sent
it
two
days
ago
good
boy
said
minot
i
knew
this
game
down
here
did
satisfy
you
may
i
be
the
first
to
wish
you
joy
you
with
a
face
like
a
defeated
candidate
i
say
cheer
up
stretch
out
eager
arms
in
your
direction
yet
i
do
believe
it
jack
well
while
there
life
there
still
considerable
hope
lying
loose
about
the
landscape
that
why
i
do
urge
you
to
take
the
train
with
me
an
hour
later
paddock
spoke
further
cheering
words
in
his
ear
and
departed
for
the
north
and
in
that
city
of
moonlight
and
romance
minot
was
left
practically
alone
he
took
a
little
farewell
walk
through
that
quaint
old
town
then
retired
to
his
room
to
read
another
chapter
in
the
at
in
the
morning
he
noted
a
small
local
train
would
leave
for
jacksonville
he
decided
he
would
take
it
with
no
parlor
cars
no
sleepers
he
would
not
be
likely
to
encounter
upon
it
any
of
the
startled
wedding
party
bound
north
the
call
he
left
did
not
materialize
and
it
was
four
when
he
awoke
hastily
in
the
chill
dawn
he
bade
farewell
to
town
and
hotel
in
fifteen
minutes
he
had
left
both
behind
and
was
speeding
toward
the
small
yellow
station
set
on
the
town
edge
he
glanced
feverishly
at
his
watch
there
was
need
of
haste
for
this
train
was
made
up
in
san
marco
and
had
had
as
yet
no
chance
to
be
late
he
rushed
through
the
gate
just
as
it
was
being
closed
and
caught
a
dreary
little
train
in
the
very
act
of
pulling
out
gloomy
oil
lamps
sought
vainly
to
lessen
the
dour
aspect
of
its
two
coaches
panting
he
entered
the
rear
coach
and
threw
himself
and
his
bag
into
a
seat
five
seconds
later
he
glanced
across
the
aisle
and
discovered
in
the
opposite
seat
miss
cynthia
meyrick
accompanied
by
a
very
family
the
devil
said
minot
to
himself
he
knew
that
she
would
see
in
this
utter
accident
nothing
save
a
deliberate
act
of
following
what
use
to
protest
his
innocence
he
considered
moving
to
another
seat
but
such
a
theatric
act
could
only
increase
the
embarrassment
already
his
presence
had
been
noted
aunt
mary
had
given
him
a
glare
spencer
meyrick
a
scowl
the
girl
a
cloudy
vague
where
have
i
seen
this
person
before
glance
in
passing
might
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
he
settled
himself
in
his
seat
once
again
as
on
another
railroad
car
he
sought
to
keep
his
eyes
on
the
landscape
without
the
dim
landscape
with
the
royal
palms
waving
like
grim
ghosts
in
the
half
light
the
train
sped
on
a
most
uncomfortable
situation
if
only
it
would
grow
light
it
seemed
so
silly
to
be
forced
to
find
the
view
out
the
window
entrancing
while
it
was
still
very
dark
spencer
meyrick
went
forward
to
the
smoker
aunt
mary
weary
of
life
slid
gently
down
to
slumber
her
unlovely
snore
filled
the
dim
car
how
different
this
from
the
first
ride
together
the
faint
pink
of
the
sky
grew
brighter
now
minot
could
see
the
gray
moss
hanging
to
the
evergreens
and
here
and
there
a
squalid
shack
where
human
beings
lived
and
knew
nothing
of
life
and
beside
him
he
heard
a
sound
as
of
a
large
body
being
shaken
also
the
guttural
protest
of
aunt
mary
at
this
inconsiderate
treatment
aunt
mary
triumphed
her
snore
rose
to
shatter
the
smoky
roof
three
times
minot
dared
to
look
and
each
time
wished
he
had
the
whole
sky
was
rosy
now
somewhere
off
behind
the
horizon
the
good
old
sun
was
rising
to
go
to
work
for
the
passenger
department
of
the
coast
railroad
some
sense
in
looking
out
now
minot
saw
a
shack
that
seemed
familiar
then
another
next
a
station
bearing
on
its
sad
shingle
the
cheery
name
of
sunbeam
and
close
to
the
station
gloomy
in
the
dawn
a
desiccated
chauffeur
beside
an
aged
automobile
minot
turned
quickly
and
caught
cynthia
meyrick
in
the
act
of
peering
over
his
shoulder
she
had
seen
the
chauffeur
too
the
train
had
stopped
a
moment
but
was
under
way
again
in
those
brown
eyes
minot
saw
something
wistful
something
hurt
saw
things
that
moved
him
to
put
everything
to
a
sudden
test
he
leaped
to
his
feet
and
pulled
madly
at
the
bell
cord
what
what
have
you
done
startled
she
stared
at
him
i
stopped
the
train
i
going
to
ride
to
jacksonville
as
i
rode
to
san
marco
ages
ago
i
not
going
alone
indeed
quick
the
conductor
will
be
here
in
a
minute
here
a
card
and
pencil
write
a
note
for
aunt
mary
say
you
meet
them
in
jacksonville
hurry
please
mr
minot
with
great
dignity
one
last
ride
together
one
last
chance
for
me
to
to
set
things
right
if
i
can
if
you
can
if
i
admit
it
wo
you
give
me
the
chance
i
thought
you
would
be
game
i
dare
you
for
a
second
they
gazed
into
each
other
eyes
the
train
had
come
to
a
stop
and
aunt
mary
stirred
fretfully
in
her
sleep
with
sudden
decision
cynthia
meyrick
wrote
on
the
card
and
dropped
it
on
her
slumbering
relative
i
know
i
be
sorry
but
she
gasped
hurry
this
way
the
conductor
coming
there
a
moment
later
they
stood
together
on
the
platform
of
the
sunbeam
station
while
the
brief
little
train
disappeared
indignantly
in
the
distance
you
should
have
made
me
do
that
cried
the
girl
in
dismay
always
doing
things
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
things
i
regret
afterward
i
know
you
explained
that
to
me
once
but
you
can
also
do
things
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
that
you
glad
about
all
your
life
oh
good
morning
barney
oldfield
good
morning
replied
the
rustic
chauffeur
with
gleeful
recognition
where
it
to
this
time
mister
jacksonville
and
no
hurry
at
all
minot
held
open
the
door
and
the
girl
stepped
into
the
car
the
gentleman
is
quite
mistaken
she
said
to
the
chauffeur
there
is
a
very
great
hurry
ages
of
time
until
luncheon
replied
minot
blithely
also
getting
in
if
you
were
thinking
of
announcing
something
then
i
shall
have
nothing
to
announce
i
sure
but
i
must
be
in
jacksonville
before
that
train
father
will
be
furious
trust
me
lady
said
the
chauffeur
grinding
again
at
his
hooded
i
been
doing
stunts
with
this
car
since
i
saw
you
last
been
over
a
hundred
miles
from
sunbeam
begins
to
look
as
though
florida
was
going
to
be
big
enough
after
all
he
leaped
to
the
wheel
and
again
that
ancient
automobile
carried
cynthia
meyrick
and
the
representative
of
lloyds
out
of
the
town
of
sunbeam
but
the
exit
was
not
a
laughing
one
the
girl
eyes
were
serious
cold
and
with
real
concern
in
his
voice
minot
spoke
wo
you
forgive
me
ca
you
i
was
only
trying
to
be
faithful
to
the
man
who
sent
me
down
here
faithful
through
everything
as
i
should
be
faithful
to
you
if
you
gave
me
the
chance
is
it
too
late
cynthia
there
was
a
time
said
the
girl
her
eyes
wide
when
it
was
not
too
late
have
you
forgotten
that
night
on
the
balcony
when
i
threw
myself
at
your
feet
and
you
turned
away
do
you
think
that
was
a
happy
moment
for
me
was
it
happy
for
me
for
that
matter
oh
i
was
humiliated
ashamed
then
your
silly
rescue
of
my
gown
your
advice
to
me
to
marry
harrowby
would
you
have
had
me
throw
over
the
men
who
trusted
me
i
i
do
know
i
only
know
that
i
ca
forgive
what
has
happened
in
a
minute
what
was
that
last
nothing
you
said
in
a
minute
your
ears
are
deceiving
you
cynthia
you
not
going
to
punish
me
because
i
was
faithful
you
suppose
i
tried
to
get
some
one
in
my
place
did
you
the
day
i
first
rode
in
this
car
with
you
and
then
i
stopped
trying
why
because
i
realized
that
if
some
one
came
in
my
place
i
have
to
go
away
and
never
see
you
again
and
i
could
do
that
i
had
to
be
near
you
dear
girl
do
worry
he
ca
hear
the
motor
too
noisy
i
had
to
be
where
i
could
see
that
little
curl
making
a
question
mark
round
your
ear
where
i
could
hear
your
voice
i
had
to
be
near
you
even
if
to
do
it
i
must
break
my
heart
by
marrying
you
to
another
man
i
loved
you
i
love
you
now
a
terrific
crash
interrupted
dolefully
the
chauffeur
descended
from
the
car
to
make
an
examination
dolefully
he
announced
the
result
busted
right
off
he
remarked
say
i
sorry
i
have
to
walk
back
to
the
garage
at
sunbeam
and
and
i
afraid
you
have
to
jest
sit
here
until
i
come
back
he
went
slowly
down
the
road
and
the
two
sat
in
that
ancient
car
in
the
midst
of
sandy
desolation
cynthia
minot
cried
i
worship
you
wo
you
the
girl
gave
a
strange
little
cry
i
wanted
to
be
cross
with
you
a
little
longer
she
said
almost
tearfully
but
i
ca
i
wonder
why
i
ca
i
cried
all
night
at
the
thought
of
never
seeing
you
again
i
wonder
why
i
cried
i
guess
it
because
for
the
first
time
i
really
in
love
cynthia
oh
dick
do
let
me
change
my
mind
again
ever
ever
only
over
my
dead
body
with
one
accord
they
turned
and
looked
at
that
quaint
southern
chauffeur
plodding
along
through
the
dust
and
the
sunshine
it
did
not
seem
to
either
of
them
that
there
was
any
danger
of
his
looking
back
and
happily
he
did
the
end
