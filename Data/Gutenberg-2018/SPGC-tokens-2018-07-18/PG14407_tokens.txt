to
the
of

coming
along
the

bonnet
as
soon
as
they
had
passed

down
into
the
road
and
set
off
with
a
hop
skip
and
a
jump
to
call
upon
his
relations
who
lived
in
the
wood
at
the
back
of

wood
was
full
of
rabbit

and
in
the
neatest
sandiest
hole
of
all
lived
benjamin

did
not
very
much
want
to
see

came
round

of
the
and
nearly
tumbled
upon
the
top
of
his
cousin
peter
illustration
illustration
peter
was
sitting
by
himself
he
looked
poorly
and
was
dressed
in
a
red
cotton
peter
said
little
benjamin
in
a
whisper
who
has
got
your
clothes
peter
replied
the
scarecrow
in
mcgregor
garden
and
described
how
he
had
been
chased
about
the
garden
and
had
dropped
his
shoes
and
coat
little
benjamin
sat
down
beside
his
cousin
and
assured
him
that
mcgregor
had
gone
out
in
a
gig
and
mcgregor
also
and
certainly
for
the
day
because
she
was
wearing
her
best
bonnet
illustration
illustration
peter
said
he
hoped
that
it
would
rain
at
this
point
old
rabbit
voice
was
heard
inside
the
rabbit
hole
calling
fetch
some
more
camomile
peter
said
he
thought
he
might
feel
better
if
he
went
for
a
walk
they
went
away
hand
in
hand
and
got
upon
the
flat
top
of
the
wall
at
the
bottom
of
the
wood
from
here
they
looked
down
into
mcgregor
garden
peter
coat
and
shoes
were
plainly
to
be
seen
upon
the
scarecrow
topped
with
an
old
of
mcgregor
illustration
illustration
little
benjamin
said
it
spoils
people
clothes
to
squeeze
under
a
gate
the
proper
way
to
get
in
is
to
climb
down
a
peter
fell
down
head
first
but
it
was
of
no
consequence
as
the
bed
below
was
newly
raked
and
quite
soft
it
had
been
sown
with
lettuces
they
left
a
great
many
odd
little
footmarks
all
over
the
bed
especially
little
benjamin
who
was
wearing
clogs
illustration
illustration
little
benjamin
said
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
was
to
get
back
peter
clothes
in
order
that
they
might
be
able
to
use
the
they
took
them
off
the
scarecrow
there
had
been
rain
during
the
night
there
was
water
in
the
shoes
and
the
coat
was
somewhat
shrunk
benjamin
tried
on
the
but
it
was
too
big
for
him
then
he
suggested
that
they
should
fill
the
with
onions
as
a
little
present
for
his
aunt
peter
did
not
seem
to
be
enjoying
himself
he
kept
hearing
noises
illustration
illustration
benjamin
on
the
contrary
was
perfectly
at
home
and
ate
a
lettuce
leaf
he
said
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
coming
to
the
garden
with
his
father
to
get
lettuces
for
their
sunday
dinner
the
name
of
little
benjamin
papa
was
old
benjamin
bunny
the
lettuces
certainly
were
very
fine
peter
did
not
eat
anything
he
said
he
should
like
to
go
home
presently
he
dropped
half
the
onions
illustration
illustration
little
benjamin
said
that
it
was
not
possible
to
get
back
up
the
with
a
load
of
vegetables
he
led
the
way
boldly
towards
the
other
end
of
the
garden
they
went
along
a
little
walk
on
planks
under
a
sunny
red
brick
wall
the
mice
sat
on
their
doorsteps
cracking
they
winked
at
peter
rabbit
and
little
benjamin
bunny
presently
peter
let
the
go
again
illustration
illustration
they
got
amongst
and
frames
and
tubs
peter
heard
noises
worse
than
ever
his
eyes
were
as
big
as
he
was
a
step
or
two
in
front
of
his
cousin
when
he
suddenly
stopped
this
is
what
those
little
rabbits
saw
round
that
corner
little
benjamin
took
one
look
and
then
in
half
a
minute
less
than
no
time
he
hid
himself
and
peter
and
the
onions
underneath
a
large
basket
illustration
illustration
the
cat
got
up
and
stretched
herself
and
came
and
sniffed
at
the
basket
perhaps
she
liked
the
smell
of
onions
anyway
she
sat
down
upon
the
top
of
the
basket
she
sat
there
for
i
can
not
draw
you
a
picture
of
peter
and
benjamin
underneath
the
basket
because
it
was
quite
dark
and
because
the
smell
of
onions
was
fearful
it
made
peter
rabbit
and
little
benjamin
cry
the
sun
got
round
behind
the
wood
and
it
was
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
but
still
the
cat
sat
upon
the
basket
illustration
illustration
at
length
there
was
a
and
some
bits
of
mortar
fell
from
the
wall
above
the
cat
looked
up
and
saw
old
benjamin
bunny
prancing
along
the
top
of
the
wall
of
the
upper
terrace
he
was
smoking
a
pipe
of
and
had
a
little
switch
in
his
hand
he
was
looking
for
his
son
old
bunny
had
no
opinion
whatever
of
cats
he
took
a
tremendous
jump
off
the
top
of
the
wall
on
to
the
top
of
the
cat
and
cuffed
it
off
the
basket
and
kicked
it
into
the
greenhouse
scratching
off
a
handful
of
fur
the
cat
was
too
much
surprised
to
scratch
back
illustration
illustration
when
old
bunny
had
driven
the
cat
into
the
greenhouse
he
locked
the
door
then
he
came
back
to
the
basket
and
took
out
his
son
benjamin
by
the
ears
and
whipped
him
with
the
little
switch
then
he
took
out
his
nephew
peter
then
he
took
out
the
handkerchief
of
onions
and
marched
out
of
the
garden
illustration
when
mcgregor
returned
about
half
an
hour
later
he
observed
several
things
which
perplexed
him
it
looked
as
though
some
person
had
been
walking
all
over
the
garden
in
a
pair
of
clogs
only
the
footmarks
were
too
ridiculously
little
also
he
could
not
understand
how
the
cat
could
have
managed
to
shut
herself
up
the
greenhouse
locking
the
door
upon
the
illustration
illustration
when
peter
got
home
his
mother
forgave
him
because
she
was
so
glad
to
see
that
he
had
found
his
shoes
and
coat
and
peter
folded
up
the
and
old
rabbit
strung
up
the
onions
and
hung
them
from
the
kitchen
ceiling
with
the
bunches
of
herbs
and
the
the
end
