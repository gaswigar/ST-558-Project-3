death
strikes
a
king
the
king
of
vendhya
was
dying
through
the
hot
stifling
night
the
temple
gongs
boomed
and
the
conchs
roared
their
clamor
was
a
faint
echo
in
the
chamber
where
bunda
chand
struggled
on
the
dais
beads
of
sweat
glistened
on
his
dark
skin
his
fingers
twisted
the
fabric
beneath
him
he
was
young
no
spear
had
touched
him
no
poison
lurked
in
his
wine
but
his
veins
stood
out
like
blue
cords
on
his
temples
and
his
eyes
dilated
with
the
nearness
of
death
trembling
knelt
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
and
leaning
down
to
him
watching
him
with
passionate
intensity
was
his
sister
the
devi
yasmina
with
her
was
the
a
noble
grown
old
in
the
royal
court
she
threw
up
her
head
in
a
gusty
gesture
of
wrath
and
despair
as
the
thunder
of
the
distant
drums
reached
her
ears
priests
and
their
clamor
she
exclaimed
are
no
wiser
than
the
leeches
who
are
helpless
nay
he
dies
and
none
can
say
why
he
is
dying
now
and
i
stand
here
helpless
who
would
burn
the
whole
city
and
spill
the
blood
of
thousands
to
save
him
a
man
of
ayodhya
but
would
die
in
his
place
if
it
might
be
devi
answered
the
poison
tell
you
it
is
not
poison
she
cried
his
birth
he
has
been
guarded
so
closely
that
the
cleverest
poisoners
of
the
east
could
not
reach
him
five
skulls
bleaching
on
the
tower
of
the
kites
can
testify
to
attempts
which
were
made
and
which
failed
as
you
well
know
there
are
ten
men
and
ten
women
whose
sole
duty
is
to
taste
his
food
and
wine
and
fifty
armed
warriors
guard
his
chamber
as
they
guard
it
now
no
it
is
not
poison
it
is
sorcery
black
ghastly
magic
she
ceased
as
the
king
spoke
his
livid
lips
did
not
move
and
there
was
no
recognition
in
his
glassy
eyes
but
his
voice
rose
in
an
eery
call
indistinct
and
far
away
as
if
called
to
her
from
beyond
vast
gulfs
yasmina
my
sister
where
are
you
i
can
not
find
you
all
is
darkness
and
the
roaring
of
great
winds
cried
yasmina
catching
his
limp
hand
in
a
convulsive
grasp
am
here
do
you
not
know
me
her
voice
died
at
the
utter
vacancy
of
his
face
a
low
confused
moan
waned
from
his
mouth
the
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
whimpered
with
fear
and
yasmina
beat
her
breast
in
anguish
in
another
part
of
the
city
a
man
stood
in
a
latticed
balcony
overlooking
a
long
street
in
which
torches
tossed
luridly
smokily
revealing
upturned
dark
faces
and
the
whites
of
gleaming
eyes
a
wailing
rose
from
the
multitude
the
man
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
and
turned
back
into
the
arabesque
chamber
he
was
a
tall
man
compactly
built
and
richly
clad
king
is
not
yet
dead
but
the
dirge
is
sounded
he
said
to
another
man
who
sat
on
a
mat
in
a
corner
this
man
was
clad
in
a
brown
robe
and
sandals
and
a
green
turban
was
on
his
head
his
expression
was
tranquil
his
gaze
impersonal
people
know
he
will
never
see
another
dawn
this
man
answered
the
first
speaker
favored
him
with
a
long
searching
stare
i
can
not
understand
he
said
why
i
have
had
to
wait
so
long
for
your
masters
to
strike
if
they
have
slain
the
king
now
why
could
they
not
have
slain
him
months
ago
the
arts
you
call
sorcery
are
governed
by
cosmic
laws
answered
the
man
in
the
green
turban
stars
direct
these
actions
as
in
other
affairs
not
even
my
masters
can
alter
the
stars
not
until
the
heavens
were
in
the
proper
order
could
they
perform
this
necromancy
with
a
long
stained
fingernail
he
mapped
the
constellations
on
the
floor
slant
of
the
moon
presaged
evil
for
the
king
of
vendhya
the
stars
are
in
turmoil
the
serpent
in
the
house
of
the
elephant
during
such
juxtaposition
the
invisible
guardians
are
removed
from
the
spirit
of
bhunda
chand
a
path
is
opened
in
the
unseen
realms
and
once
a
point
of
contact
was
established
mighty
powers
were
put
in
play
along
that
path
of
contact
inquired
the
other
you
mean
that
lock
of
bhunda
chand
hair
all
discarded
portions
of
the
human
body
still
remain
part
of
it
attached
to
it
by
intangible
connections
the
priests
of
asura
have
a
dim
inkling
of
this
truth
and
so
all
nail
trimmings
hair
and
other
waste
products
of
the
persons
of
the
royal
family
are
carefully
reduced
to
ashes
and
the
ashes
hidden
but
at
the
urgent
entreaty
of
the
princess
of
khosala
who
loved
bhunda
chand
vainly
he
gave
her
a
lock
of
his
long
black
hair
as
a
token
of
remembrance
when
my
masters
decided
upon
his
doom
the
lock
in
its
golden
case
was
stolen
from
under
her
pillow
while
she
slept
and
another
substituted
so
like
the
first
that
she
never
knew
the
difference
then
the
genuine
lock
travelled
by
up
the
long
long
road
to
peshkhauri
thence
up
the
zhaibar
pass
until
it
reached
the
hands
of
those
for
whom
it
was
intended
a
lock
of
hair
murmured
the
nobleman
which
a
soul
is
drawn
from
its
body
and
across
gulfs
of
echoing
space
returned
the
man
on
the
mat
the
nobleman
studied
him
curiously
do
not
know
if
you
are
a
man
or
a
demon
khemsa
he
said
at
last
of
us
are
what
we
seem
i
whom
the
kshatriyas
know
as
kerim
shah
a
prince
from
iranistan
am
no
greater
a
masquerader
than
most
men
they
are
all
traitors
in
one
way
or
another
and
half
of
them
know
not
whom
they
serve
there
at
least
i
have
no
doubts
for
i
serve
king
yezdigerd
of
turan
i
the
black
seers
of
yimsha
said
khemsa
my
masters
are
greater
than
yours
for
they
have
accomplished
by
their
arts
what
yezdigerd
could
not
with
a
hundred
thousand
swords
outside
the
moan
of
the
tortured
thousands
shuddered
up
to
the
stars
which
crusted
the
sweating
vendhyan
night
and
the
conchs
bellowed
like
oxen
in
pain
in
the
gardens
of
the
palace
the
torches
glinted
on
polished
helmets
and
curved
swords
and
corselets
all
the
of
ayodhya
were
gathered
in
the
great
palace
or
about
it
and
at
each
gate
and
door
fifty
archers
stood
on
guard
with
bows
in
their
hands
but
death
stalked
through
the
royal
palace
and
none
could
stay
his
ghostly
tread
on
the
dais
under
the
golden
dome
the
king
cried
out
again
racked
by
awful
paroxysms
again
his
voice
came
faintly
and
far
away
and
again
the
devi
bent
to
him
trembling
with
a
fear
that
was
darker
than
the
terror
of
death
again
that
far
weirdly
dreeing
cry
from
realms
immeasurable
me
i
am
far
from
my
mortal
house
wizards
have
drawn
my
soul
through
the
darkness
they
seek
to
snap
the
silver
cord
that
binds
me
to
my
dying
body
they
cluster
around
me
their
hands
are
taloned
their
eyes
are
red
like
flame
burning
in
darkness
save
me
my
sister
their
fingers
sear
me
like
fire
they
would
slay
my
body
and
damn
my
soul
what
is
this
they
bring
before
me
at
the
terror
in
his
hopeless
cry
yasmina
screamed
uncontrollably
and
threw
herself
bodily
upon
him
in
the
abandon
of
her
anguish
he
was
torn
by
a
terrible
convulsion
foam
flew
from
his
contorted
lips
and
his
writhing
fingers
left
their
marks
on
the
girl
shoulders
but
the
glassy
blankness
passed
from
his
eyes
like
smoke
blown
from
a
fire
and
he
looked
up
at
his
sister
with
recognition
she
sobbed
he
gasped
and
his
weakening
voice
was
rational
know
now
what
brings
me
to
the
pyre
i
have
been
on
a
far
journey
and
i
understand
i
have
been
ensorcelled
by
the
wizards
of
the
himelians
they
drew
my
soul
out
of
my
body
and
far
away
into
a
stone
room
there
they
strove
to
break
the
silver
cord
of
life
and
thrust
my
soul
into
the
body
of
a
foul
their
sorcery
summoned
up
from
hell
ah
i
feel
their
pull
upon
me
now
your
cry
and
the
grip
of
your
fingers
brought
me
back
but
i
am
going
fast
my
soul
clings
to
my
body
but
its
hold
weakens
quick
kill
me
before
they
can
trap
my
soul
for
ever
can
not
she
wailed
smiting
her
naked
breasts
i
command
you
there
was
the
old
imperious
note
in
his
failing
whisper
have
never
disobeyed
me
obey
my
last
command
send
my
soul
clean
to
asura
haste
lest
you
damn
me
to
spend
eternity
as
a
filthy
gaunt
of
darkness
strike
i
command
you
sobbing
wildly
yasmina
plucked
a
jeweled
dagger
from
her
girdle
and
plunged
it
to
the
hilt
in
his
breast
he
stiffened
and
then
went
limp
a
grim
smile
curving
his
dead
lips
yasmina
hurled
herself
on
the
floor
beating
the
reeds
with
her
clenched
hands
outside
the
gongs
and
conchs
brayed
and
thundered
and
the
priests
gashed
themselves
with
copper
knives
a
barbarian
from
the
hills
chunder
shan
governor
of
peshkhauri
laid
down
his
golden
pen
and
carefully
scanned
that
which
he
had
written
on
parchment
that
bore
his
official
seal
he
had
ruled
peshkhauri
so
long
only
because
he
weighed
his
every
word
spoken
or
written
danger
breeds
caution
and
only
a
wary
man
lives
long
in
that
wild
country
where
the
hot
vendhyan
plains
meet
the
crags
of
the
himelians
an
hour
ride
westward
or
northward
and
one
crossed
the
border
and
was
among
the
hills
where
men
lived
by
the
law
of
the
knife
the
governor
was
alone
in
his
chamber
seated
at
his
ornately
carven
table
of
inlaid
ebony
through
the
wide
window
open
for
the
coolness
he
could
see
a
square
of
the
blue
himelian
night
dotted
with
great
white
stars
an
adjacent
parapet
was
a
shadowy
line
and
further
crenelles
and
embrasures
were
barely
hinted
at
in
the
dim
starlight
the
governor
fortress
was
strong
and
situated
outside
the
walls
of
the
city
it
guarded
the
breeze
that
stirred
the
tapestries
on
the
wall
brought
faint
noises
from
the
streets
of
peshkhauri
occasional
snatches
of
wailing
song
or
the
thrum
of
a
cithern
the
governor
read
what
he
had
written
slowly
with
his
open
hand
shading
his
eyes
from
the
bronze
butterlamp
his
lips
moving
absently
as
he
read
he
heard
the
drum
of
horses
hoofs
outside
the
barbican
the
sharp
staccato
of
the
guards
challenge
he
did
not
heed
intent
upon
his
letter
it
was
addressed
to
the
of
vendhya
at
the
royal
court
of
ayodhya
and
it
stated
after
the
customary
salutations
it
be
known
to
your
excellency
that
i
have
faithfully
carried
out
your
excellency
instructions
the
seven
tribesmen
are
well
guarded
in
their
prison
and
i
have
repeatedly
sent
word
into
the
hills
that
their
chief
come
in
person
to
bargain
for
their
release
but
he
has
made
no
move
except
to
send
word
that
unless
they
are
freed
he
will
burn
peshkhauri
and
cover
his
saddle
with
my
hide
begging
your
excellency
indulgence
this
he
is
quite
capable
of
attempting
and
i
have
tripled
the
numbers
of
the
lance
guards
the
man
is
not
a
native
of
ghulistan
i
can
not
with
certainty
predict
his
next
move
but
since
it
is
the
wish
of
the
devi
he
was
out
of
his
ivory
chair
and
on
his
feet
facing
the
arched
door
all
in
one
instant
he
snatched
at
the
curved
sword
lying
in
its
ornate
scabbard
on
the
table
and
then
checked
the
movement
it
was
a
woman
who
had
entered
unannounced
a
woman
whose
gossamer
robes
did
not
conceal
the
rich
garments
beneath
them
any
more
than
they
concealed
the
suppleness
and
beauty
of
her
tall
slender
figure
a
filmy
veil
fell
below
her
breasts
supported
by
a
flowing
headdress
bound
about
with
a
triple
gold
braid
and
adorned
with
a
golden
crescent
her
dark
eyes
regarded
the
astonished
governor
over
the
veil
and
then
with
an
imperious
gesture
of
her
white
hand
she
uncovered
her
face
the
governor
dropped
to
his
knees
before
her
surprize
and
confusion
somewhat
spoiling
the
stateliness
of
his
obeisance
with
a
gesture
she
motioned
him
to
rise
and
he
hastened
to
lead
her
to
the
ivory
chair
all
the
while
bowing
level
with
his
girdle
but
his
first
words
were
of
reproof
majesty
this
was
most
unwise
the
border
is
unsettled
raids
from
the
hills
are
incessant
you
came
with
a
large
attendance
ample
retinue
followed
me
to
peshkhauri
she
answered
lodged
my
people
there
and
came
on
to
the
fort
with
my
maid
gitara
chunder
shan
groaned
in
horror
you
do
not
understand
the
peril
an
hour
ride
from
this
spot
the
hills
swarm
with
barbarians
who
make
a
profession
of
murder
and
rapine
women
have
been
stolen
and
men
stabbed
between
the
fort
and
the
city
peshkhauri
is
not
like
your
southern
provinces
i
am
here
and
unharmed
she
interrupted
with
a
trace
of
impatience
showed
my
signet
ring
to
the
guard
at
the
gate
and
to
the
one
outside
your
door
and
they
admitted
me
unannounced
not
knowing
me
but
supposing
me
to
be
a
secret
courier
from
ayodhya
let
us
not
now
waste
time
have
received
no
word
from
the
chief
of
the
barbarians
save
threats
and
curses
devi
he
is
wary
and
suspicious
he
deems
it
a
trap
and
perhaps
he
is
not
to
be
blamed
the
kshatriyas
have
not
always
kept
their
promises
to
the
hill
people
must
be
brought
to
terms
broke
in
yasmina
the
knuckles
of
her
clenched
hands
showing
white
do
not
understand
the
governor
shook
his
head
i
chanced
to
capture
these
seven
i
reported
their
capture
to
the
as
is
the
custom
and
then
before
i
could
hang
them
there
came
an
order
to
hold
them
and
communicate
with
their
chief
this
i
did
but
the
man
holds
aloof
as
i
have
said
these
men
are
of
the
tribe
of
afghulis
but
he
is
a
foreigner
from
the
west
and
he
is
called
conan
i
have
threatened
to
hang
them
tomorrow
at
dawn
if
he
does
not
come
exclaimed
the
devi
have
done
well
and
i
will
tell
you
why
i
have
given
these
orders
my
brother
she
faltered
choking
and
the
governor
bowed
his
head
with
the
customary
gesture
of
respect
for
a
departed
sovereign
king
of
vendhya
was
destroyed
by
magic
she
said
at
last
have
devoted
my
life
to
the
destruction
of
his
murderers
as
he
died
he
gave
me
a
clue
and
i
have
followed
it
i
have
read
the
of
and
talked
with
nameless
hermits
in
the
caves
below
jhelai
i
learned
how
and
by
whom
he
was
destroyed
his
enemies
were
the
black
seers
of
mount
yimsha
whispered
chunder
shan
paling
her
eyes
knifed
him
through
you
fear
them
does
not
your
majesty
he
replied
are
black
devils
haunting
the
uninhabited
hills
beyond
the
zhaibar
but
the
sages
say
that
they
seldom
interfere
in
the
lives
of
mortal
men
they
slew
my
brother
i
do
not
know
she
answered
i
have
sworn
on
the
altar
of
asura
to
destroy
them
and
i
need
the
aid
of
a
man
beyond
the
border
a
kshatriya
army
unaided
would
never
reach
yimsha
muttered
chunder
shan
speak
the
truth
there
it
would
be
fight
every
step
of
the
way
with
hairy
hurling
down
boulders
from
every
height
and
rushing
us
with
their
long
knives
in
every
valley
the
turanians
fought
their
way
through
the
himelians
once
but
how
many
returned
to
khurusun
few
of
those
who
escaped
the
swords
of
the
kshatriyas
after
the
king
your
brother
defeated
their
host
on
the
jhumda
river
ever
saw
secunderam
again
so
i
must
control
men
across
the
border
she
said
who
know
the
way
to
mount
yimsha
the
tribes
fear
the
black
seers
and
shun
the
unholy
mountain
broke
in
the
governor
the
chief
conan
fear
them
she
asked
as
to
that
muttered
the
governor
doubt
if
there
is
anything
that
devil
fears
i
have
been
told
therefore
he
is
the
man
i
must
deal
with
he
wishes
the
release
of
his
seven
men
very
well
their
ransom
shall
be
the
heads
of
the
black
seers
her
voice
thrummed
with
hate
as
she
uttered
the
last
words
and
her
hands
clenched
at
her
sides
she
looked
an
image
of
incarnate
passion
as
she
stood
there
with
her
head
thrown
high
and
her
bosom
heaving
again
the
governor
knelt
for
part
of
his
wisdom
was
the
knowledge
that
a
woman
in
such
an
emotional
tempest
is
as
perilous
as
a
blind
cobra
to
any
about
her
shall
be
as
you
wish
your
majesty
then
as
she
presented
a
calmer
aspect
he
rose
and
ventured
to
drop
a
word
of
warning
can
not
predict
what
the
chief
conan
action
will
be
the
tribesmen
are
always
turbulent
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
emissaries
from
the
turanians
are
stirring
them
up
to
raid
our
borders
as
your
majesty
knows
the
turanians
have
established
themselves
in
secunderam
and
other
northern
cities
though
the
hill
tribes
remain
unconquered
king
yezdigerd
has
long
looked
southward
with
greedy
lust
and
perhaps
is
seeking
to
gain
by
treachery
what
he
could
not
win
by
force
of
arms
i
have
thought
that
conan
might
well
be
one
of
his
spies
shall
see
she
answered
he
loves
his
followers
he
will
be
at
the
gates
at
dawn
to
parley
i
shall
spend
the
night
in
the
fortress
i
came
in
disguise
to
peshkhauri
and
lodged
my
retinue
at
an
inn
instead
of
the
palace
besides
my
people
only
yourself
knows
of
my
presence
here
shall
escort
you
to
your
quarters
your
majesty
said
the
governor
and
as
they
emerged
from
the
doorway
he
beckoned
the
warrior
on
guard
there
and
the
man
fell
in
behind
them
spear
held
at
salute
the
maid
waited
veiled
like
her
mistress
outside
the
door
and
the
group
traversed
a
wide
winding
corridor
lighted
by
smoky
torches
and
reached
the
quarters
reserved
for
visiting
notables
generals
and
viceroys
mostly
none
of
the
royal
family
had
ever
honored
the
fortress
before
chunder
shan
had
a
perturbed
feeling
that
the
suite
was
not
suitable
to
such
an
exalted
personage
as
the
devi
and
though
she
sought
to
make
him
feel
at
ease
in
her
presence
he
was
glad
when
she
dismissed
him
and
he
bowed
himself
out
all
the
menials
of
the
fort
had
been
summoned
to
serve
his
royal
guest
though
he
did
not
divulge
her
identity
and
he
stationed
a
squad
of
spearmen
before
her
doors
among
them
the
warrior
who
had
guarded
his
own
chamber
in
his
preoccupation
he
forgot
to
replace
the
man
the
governor
had
not
been
long
gone
from
her
when
yasmina
suddenly
remembered
something
else
which
she
had
wished
to
discuss
with
him
but
had
forgotten
until
that
moment
it
concerned
the
past
actions
of
one
kerim
shah
a
nobleman
from
iranistan
who
had
dwelt
for
a
while
in
peshkhauri
before
coming
on
to
the
court
at
ayodhya
a
vague
suspicion
concerning
the
man
had
been
stirred
by
a
glimpse
of
him
in
peshkhauri
that
night
she
wondered
if
he
had
followed
her
from
ayodhya
being
a
truly
remarkable
devi
she
did
not
summon
the
governor
to
her
again
but
hurried
out
into
the
corridor
alone
and
hastened
toward
his
chamber
chunder
shan
entering
his
chamber
closed
the
door
and
went
to
his
table
there
he
took
the
letter
he
had
been
writing
and
tore
it
to
bits
scarcely
had
he
finished
when
he
heard
something
drop
softly
onto
the
parapet
adjacent
to
the
window
he
looked
up
to
see
a
figure
loom
briefly
against
the
stars
and
then
a
man
dropped
lightly
into
the
room
the
light
glinted
on
a
long
sheen
of
steel
in
his
hand
he
warned
make
a
noise
or
i
send
the
devil
a
henchman
the
governor
checked
his
motion
toward
the
sword
on
the
table
he
was
within
reach
of
the
zhaibar
knife
that
glittered
in
the
intruder
fist
and
he
knew
the
desperate
quickness
of
a
hillman
the
invader
was
a
tall
man
at
once
strong
and
supple
he
was
dressed
like
a
hillman
but
his
dark
features
and
blazing
blue
eyes
did
not
match
his
garb
chunder
shan
had
never
seen
a
man
like
him
he
was
not
an
easterner
but
some
barbarian
from
the
west
but
his
aspect
was
as
untamed
and
formidable
as
any
of
the
hairy
tribesmen
who
haunt
the
hills
of
ghulistan
come
like
a
thief
in
the
night
commented
the
governor
recovering
some
of
his
composure
although
he
remembered
that
there
was
no
guard
within
call
still
the
hillman
could
not
know
that
climbed
a
bastion
snarled
the
intruder
guard
thrust
his
head
over
the
battlement
in
time
for
me
to
rap
it
with
my
are
conan
else
you
sent
word
into
the
hills
that
you
wished
for
me
to
come
and
parley
with
you
well
by
crom
i
come
keep
away
from
that
table
or
i
gut
you
merely
wish
to
seat
myself
answered
the
governor
carefully
sinking
into
the
ivory
chair
which
he
wheeled
away
from
the
table
conan
moved
restlessly
before
him
glancing
suspiciously
at
the
door
thumbing
the
razor
edge
of
his
knife
he
did
not
walk
like
an
afghuli
and
was
bluntly
direct
where
the
east
is
subtle
have
seven
of
my
men
he
said
abruptly
refused
the
ransom
i
offered
what
the
devil
do
you
want
us
discuss
terms
answered
chunder
shan
cautiously
there
was
a
timbre
of
dangerous
anger
in
his
voice
do
you
mean
have
i
offered
you
gold
chunder
shan
laughed
there
is
more
gold
in
peshkhauri
than
you
ever
saw
a
liar
retorted
conan
seen
the
of
the
goldsmiths
in
khurusun
more
than
an
afghuli
ever
saw
amended
chunder
shan
it
is
but
a
drop
of
all
the
treasure
of
vendhya
why
should
we
desire
gold
it
would
be
more
to
our
advantage
to
hang
these
seven
thieves
conan
ripped
out
a
sulfurous
oath
and
the
long
blade
quivered
in
his
grip
as
the
muscles
rose
in
ridges
on
his
brown
arm
split
your
head
like
a
ripe
melon
a
wild
blue
flame
flickered
in
the
hillman
eyes
but
chunder
shan
shrugged
his
shoulders
though
keeping
an
eye
on
the
keen
steel
can
kill
me
easily
and
probably
escape
over
the
wall
afterward
but
that
would
not
save
the
seven
tribesmen
my
men
would
surely
hang
them
and
these
men
are
headmen
among
the
afghulis
know
it
snarled
conan
tribe
is
baying
like
wolves
at
my
heels
because
i
have
not
procured
their
release
tell
me
in
plain
words
what
you
want
because
by
crom
if
there
no
other
way
i
raise
a
horde
and
lead
it
to
the
very
gates
of
peshkhauri
looking
at
the
man
as
he
stood
squarely
knife
in
fist
and
eyes
glaring
chunder
shan
did
not
doubt
that
he
was
capable
of
it
the
governor
did
not
believe
any
could
take
peshkhauri
but
he
did
not
wish
a
devastated
countryside
is
a
mission
you
must
perform
he
said
choosing
his
words
with
as
much
care
as
if
they
had
been
razors
conan
had
sprung
back
wheeling
to
face
the
door
at
the
same
instant
lips
asnarl
his
barbarian
ears
had
caught
the
quick
tread
of
soft
slippers
outside
the
door
the
next
instant
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
a
slim
form
entered
hastily
pulling
the
door
shut
then
stopping
short
at
sight
of
the
hillman
chunder
shan
sprang
up
his
heart
jumping
into
his
mouth
he
cried
involuntarily
losing
his
head
momentarily
in
his
fright
it
was
like
an
explosive
echo
from
the
hillman
lips
chunder
shan
saw
recognition
and
intent
flame
up
in
the
fierce
blue
eyes
the
governor
shouted
desperately
and
caught
at
his
sword
but
the
hillman
moved
with
the
devastating
speed
of
a
hurricane
he
sprang
knocked
the
governor
sprawling
with
a
savage
blow
of
his
swept
up
the
astounded
devi
in
one
brawny
arm
and
leaped
for
the
window
chunder
shan
struggling
frantically
to
his
feet
saw
the
man
poise
an
instant
on
the
sill
in
a
flutter
of
silken
skirts
and
white
limbs
that
was
his
royal
captive
and
heard
his
fierce
exultant
snarl
dare
to
hang
my
men
and
then
conan
leaped
to
the
parapet
and
was
gone
a
wild
scream
floated
back
to
the
governor
ears
screamed
the
governor
struggling
up
and
running
drunkenly
to
the
door
he
tore
it
open
and
reeled
into
the
hall
his
shouts
along
the
corridors
and
warriors
came
running
gaping
to
see
the
governor
holding
his
broken
head
from
which
the
blood
streamed
out
the
lancers
he
roared
has
been
an
abduction
even
in
his
frenzy
he
had
enough
sense
left
to
withhold
the
full
truth
he
stopped
short
as
he
heard
a
sudden
drum
of
hoofs
outside
a
frantic
scream
and
a
wild
yell
of
barbaric
exultation
followed
by
the
bewildered
guardsmen
the
governor
raced
for
the
stair
in
the
courtyard
of
the
fort
a
force
of
lancers
stood
by
saddled
steeds
ready
to
ride
at
an
instant
notice
chunder
shan
led
his
squadron
flying
after
the
fugitive
though
his
head
swam
so
he
had
to
hold
with
both
hands
to
the
saddle
he
did
not
divulge
the
identity
of
the
victim
but
said
merely
that
the
noblewoman
who
had
borne
the
royal
had
been
carried
away
by
the
chief
of
the
afghulis
the
abductor
was
out
of
sight
and
hearing
but
they
knew
the
path
he
would
strike
the
road
that
runs
straight
to
the
mouth
of
the
zhaibar
there
was
no
moon
peasant
huts
rose
dimly
in
the
starlight
behind
them
fell
away
the
grim
bastion
of
the
fort
and
the
towers
of
peshkhauri
ahead
of
them
loomed
the
black
walls
of
the
himelians
khemsa
uses
magic
in
the
confusion
that
reigned
in
the
fortress
while
the
guard
was
being
turned
out
no
one
noticed
that
the
girl
who
had
accompanied
the
devi
slipped
out
the
great
arched
gate
and
vanished
in
the
darkness
she
ran
straight
for
the
city
her
garments
tucked
high
she
did
not
follow
the
open
road
but
cut
straight
through
fields
and
over
slopes
avoiding
fences
and
leaping
irrigation
ditches
as
surely
as
if
it
were
broad
daylight
and
as
easily
as
if
she
were
a
trained
masculine
runner
the
of
the
guardsmen
had
faded
away
up
the
hill
before
she
reached
the
city
wall
she
did
not
go
to
the
great
gate
beneath
whose
arch
men
leaned
on
spears
and
craned
their
necks
into
the
darkness
discussing
the
unwonted
activity
about
the
fortress
she
skirted
the
wall
until
she
reached
a
certain
point
where
the
spire
of
the
tower
was
visible
above
the
battlements
then
she
placed
her
hands
to
her
mouth
and
voiced
a
low
weird
call
that
carried
strangely
almost
instantly
a
head
appeared
at
an
embrasure
and
a
rope
came
wriggling
down
the
wall
she
seized
it
placed
a
foot
in
the
loop
at
the
end
and
waved
her
arm
then
quickly
and
smoothly
she
was
drawn
up
the
sheer
stone
curtain
an
instant
later
she
scrambled
over
the
merlons
and
stood
up
on
a
flat
roof
which
covered
a
house
that
was
built
against
the
wall
there
was
an
open
trap
there
and
a
man
in
a
robe
who
silently
coiled
the
rope
not
showing
in
any
way
the
strain
of
hauling
a
woman
up
a
wall
is
kerim
shah
she
gasped
panting
after
her
long
run
in
the
house
below
you
have
news
has
stolen
the
devi
out
of
the
fortress
and
carried
her
away
into
the
hills
she
blurted
out
her
news
in
a
rush
the
words
stumbling
over
one
another
khemsa
showed
no
emotion
but
merely
nodded
his
turbaned
head
shah
will
be
glad
to
hear
that
he
said
the
girl
threw
her
supple
arms
about
his
neck
she
was
panting
hard
but
not
only
from
exertion
her
eyes
blazed
like
black
jewels
in
the
starlight
her
upturned
face
was
close
to
khemsa
but
though
he
submitted
to
her
embrace
he
did
not
return
it
not
tell
the
hyrkanian
she
panted
us
use
this
knowledge
ourselves
the
governor
has
gone
into
the
hills
with
his
riders
but
he
might
as
well
chase
a
ghost
he
has
not
told
anyone
that
it
was
the
devi
who
was
kidnapped
none
in
peshkhauri
or
the
fort
knows
it
except
us
what
good
does
it
do
us
the
man
expostulated
masters
sent
me
with
kerim
shah
to
aid
him
in
every
way
yourself
she
cried
fiercely
off
your
yoke
mean
disobey
my
masters
he
gasped
and
she
felt
his
whole
body
turn
cold
under
her
arms
she
shook
him
in
the
fury
of
her
emotion
too
are
a
magician
why
will
you
be
a
slave
using
your
powers
only
to
elevate
others
use
your
arts
for
yourself
is
forbidden
he
was
shaking
as
if
with
an
ague
am
not
one
of
the
black
circle
only
by
the
command
of
the
masters
do
i
dare
to
use
the
knowledge
they
have
taught
me
you
use
it
she
argued
passionately
as
i
beg
you
of
course
conan
has
taken
the
devi
to
hold
as
hostage
against
the
seven
tribesmen
in
the
governor
prison
destroy
them
so
chunder
shan
can
not
use
them
to
buy
back
the
devi
then
let
us
go
into
the
mountains
and
take
her
from
the
afghulis
they
can
not
stand
against
your
sorcery
with
their
knives
the
treasure
of
the
vendhyan
kings
will
be
ours
as
ransom
and
then
when
we
have
it
in
our
hands
we
can
trick
them
and
sell
her
to
the
king
of
turan
we
shall
have
wealth
beyond
our
maddest
dreams
with
it
we
can
buy
warriors
we
will
take
khorbhul
oust
the
turanians
from
the
hills
and
send
our
hosts
southward
become
king
and
queen
of
an
empire
khemsa
too
was
panting
shaking
like
a
leaf
in
her
grasp
his
face
showed
gray
in
the
starlight
beaded
with
great
drops
of
perspiration
love
you
she
cried
fiercely
writhing
her
body
against
his
almost
strangling
him
in
her
wild
embrace
shaking
him
in
her
abandon
will
make
a
king
of
you
for
love
of
you
i
betrayed
my
mistress
for
love
of
me
betray
your
masters
why
fear
the
black
seers
by
your
love
for
me
you
have
broken
one
of
their
laws
already
break
the
rest
you
are
as
strong
as
they
a
man
of
ice
could
not
have
withstood
the
searing
heat
of
her
passion
and
fury
with
an
inarticulate
cry
he
crushed
her
to
him
bending
her
backward
and
showering
gasping
kisses
on
her
eyes
face
and
lips
do
it
his
voice
was
thick
with
laboring
emotions
he
staggered
like
a
drunken
man
arts
they
have
taught
me
shall
work
for
me
not
for
my
masters
we
shall
be
rulers
of
the
world
of
the
world
then
twisting
lithely
out
of
his
embrace
she
seized
his
hand
and
led
him
toward
the
we
must
make
sure
that
the
governor
does
not
exchange
those
seven
afghulis
for
the
devi
he
moved
like
a
man
in
a
daze
until
they
had
descended
a
ladder
and
she
paused
in
the
chamber
below
kerim
shah
lay
on
a
couch
motionless
an
arm
across
his
face
as
though
to
shield
his
sleeping
eyes
from
the
soft
light
of
a
brass
lamp
she
plucked
khemsa
arm
and
made
a
quick
gesture
across
her
own
throat
khemsa
lifted
his
hand
then
his
expression
changed
and
he
drew
away
have
eaten
his
salt
he
muttered
he
can
not
interfere
with
us
he
led
the
girl
through
a
door
that
opened
on
a
winding
stair
after
their
soft
tread
had
faded
into
silence
the
man
on
the
couch
sat
up
kerim
shah
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
face
a
he
did
not
dread
but
he
feared
khemsa
as
a
man
fears
a
poisonous
reptile
who
plot
on
roofs
should
remember
to
lower
their
voices
he
muttered
as
khemsa
has
turned
against
his
masters
and
as
he
was
my
only
contact
between
them
i
can
count
on
their
aid
no
longer
from
now
on
i
play
the
game
in
my
own
way
rising
to
his
feet
he
went
quickly
to
a
table
drew
pen
and
parchment
from
his
girdle
and
scribbled
a
few
succinct
lines
khosru
khan
governor
of
secunderam
the
cimmerian
conan
has
carried
the
devi
yasmina
to
the
villages
of
the
afghulis
it
is
an
opportunity
to
get
the
devi
into
our
hands
as
the
king
has
so
long
desired
send
three
thousand
horsemen
at
once
i
will
meet
them
in
the
valley
of
gurashah
with
native
guides
and
he
signed
it
with
a
name
that
was
not
in
the
least
like
kerim
shah
then
from
a
golden
cage
he
drew
forth
a
carrier
pigeon
to
whose
leg
he
made
fast
the
parchment
rolled
into
a
tiny
cylinder
and
secured
with
gold
wire
then
he
went
quickly
to
a
casement
and
tossed
the
bird
into
the
night
it
wavered
on
fluttering
wings
balanced
and
was
gone
like
a
flitting
shadow
catching
up
helmet
sword
and
cloak
kerim
shah
hurried
out
of
the
chamber
and
down
the
winding
stair
the
prison
quarters
of
peshkhauri
were
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
city
by
a
massive
wall
in
which
was
set
a
single
door
under
an
arch
over
the
arch
burned
a
lurid
red
cresset
and
beside
the
door
squatted
a
warrior
with
spear
and
shield
this
warrior
leaning
on
his
spear
and
yawning
from
time
to
time
started
suddenly
to
his
feet
he
had
not
thought
he
had
dozed
but
a
man
was
standing
before
him
a
man
he
had
not
heard
approach
the
man
wore
a
robe
and
a
green
turban
in
the
flickering
light
of
the
cresset
his
features
were
shadowy
but
a
pair
of
lambent
eyes
shone
surprizingly
in
the
lurid
glow
comes
demanded
the
warrior
presenting
his
spear
are
you
the
stranger
did
not
seem
perturbed
though
the
touched
his
bosom
his
eyes
held
the
warrior
with
strange
intensity
are
you
obliged
to
do
he
asked
strangely
guard
the
gate
the
warrior
spoke
thickly
and
mechanically
he
stood
rigid
as
a
statue
his
eyes
slowly
glazing
lie
you
are
obliged
to
obey
me
you
have
looked
into
my
eyes
and
your
soul
is
no
longer
your
own
open
that
door
stiffly
with
the
wooden
features
of
an
image
the
guard
wheeled
about
drew
a
great
key
from
his
girdle
turned
it
in
the
massive
lock
and
swung
open
the
door
then
he
stood
at
attention
his
unseeing
stare
straight
ahead
of
him
a
woman
glided
from
the
shadows
and
laid
an
eager
hand
on
the
mesmerist
arm
him
fetch
us
horses
khemsa
she
whispered
need
of
that
answered
the
rakhsha
lifting
his
voice
slightly
he
spoke
to
the
guardsman
have
no
more
use
for
you
kill
yourself
like
a
man
in
a
trance
the
warrior
thrust
the
butt
of
his
spear
against
the
base
of
the
wall
and
placed
the
keen
head
against
his
body
just
below
the
ribs
then
slowly
stolidly
he
leaned
against
it
with
all
his
weight
so
that
it
transfixed
his
body
and
came
out
between
his
shoulders
sliding
down
the
shaft
he
lay
still
the
spear
jutting
above
him
its
full
length
like
a
horrible
stalk
growing
out
of
his
back
the
girl
stared
down
at
him
in
morbid
fascination
until
khemsa
took
her
arm
and
led
her
through
the
gate
torches
lighted
a
narrow
space
between
the
outer
wall
and
a
lower
inner
one
in
which
were
arched
doors
at
regular
intervals
a
warrior
paced
this
enclosure
and
when
the
gate
opened
he
came
sauntering
up
so
secure
in
his
knowledge
of
the
strength
that
he
was
not
suspicious
until
khemsa
and
the
girl
emerged
from
the
archway
then
it
was
too
late
the
rakhsha
did
not
waste
time
in
hypnotism
though
his
action
savored
of
magic
to
the
girl
the
guard
lowered
his
spear
threateningly
opening
his
mouth
to
shout
an
alarm
that
would
bring
spearmen
swarming
out
of
the
guardrooms
at
either
end
of
the
alleyway
khemsa
flicked
the
spear
aside
with
his
left
hand
as
a
man
might
flick
a
straw
and
his
right
flashed
out
and
back
seeming
gently
to
caress
the
warrior
neck
in
passing
and
the
guard
pitched
on
his
face
without
a
sound
his
head
lolling
on
a
broken
neck
khemsa
did
not
glance
at
him
but
went
straight
to
one
of
the
arched
doors
and
placed
his
open
hand
against
the
heavy
bronze
lock
with
a
rending
shudder
the
portal
buckled
inward
as
the
girl
followed
him
through
she
saw
that
the
thick
teakwood
hung
in
splinters
the
bronze
bolts
were
bent
and
twisted
from
their
sockets
and
the
great
hinges
broken
and
disjointed
a
with
forty
men
to
swing
it
could
have
shattered
the
barrier
no
more
completely
khemsa
was
drunk
with
freedom
and
the
exercise
of
his
power
glorying
in
his
might
and
flinging
his
strength
about
as
a
young
giant
exercises
his
thews
with
unnecessary
vigor
in
the
exultant
pride
of
his
prowess
the
broken
door
let
them
into
a
small
courtyard
lit
by
a
cresset
opposite
the
door
was
a
wide
grille
of
iron
bars
a
hairy
hand
was
visible
gripping
one
of
these
bars
and
in
the
darkness
behind
them
glimmered
the
whites
of
eyes
khemsa
stood
silent
for
a
space
gazing
into
the
shadows
from
which
those
glimmering
eyes
gave
back
his
stare
with
burning
intensity
then
his
hand
went
into
his
robe
and
came
out
again
and
from
his
opening
fingers
a
shimmering
feather
of
sparkling
dust
sifted
to
the
flags
instantly
a
flare
of
green
fire
lighted
the
enclosure
in
the
brief
glare
the
forms
of
seven
men
standing
motionless
behind
the
bars
were
limned
in
vivid
detail
tall
hairy
men
in
ragged
garments
they
did
not
speak
but
in
their
eyes
blazed
the
fear
of
death
and
their
hairy
fingers
gripped
the
bars
the
fire
died
out
but
the
glow
remained
a
quivering
ball
of
lambent
green
that
pulsed
and
shimmered
on
the
flags
before
khemsa
feet
the
wide
gaze
of
the
tribesmen
was
fixed
upon
it
it
wavered
elongated
it
turned
into
a
luminous
greensmoke
spiraling
upward
it
twisted
and
writhed
like
a
great
shadowy
serpent
then
broadened
and
billowed
out
in
shining
folds
and
whirls
it
grew
to
a
cloud
moving
silently
over
the
flags
straight
toward
the
grille
the
men
watched
its
coming
with
dilated
eyes
the
bars
quivered
with
the
grip
of
their
desperate
fingers
bearded
lips
parted
but
no
sound
came
forth
the
green
cloud
rolled
on
the
bars
and
blotted
them
from
sight
like
a
fog
it
oozed
through
the
grille
and
hid
the
men
within
from
the
enveloping
folds
came
a
strangled
gasp
as
of
a
man
plunged
suddenly
under
the
surface
of
water
that
was
all
khemsa
touched
the
girl
arm
as
she
stood
with
parted
lips
and
dilated
eyes
mechanically
she
turned
away
with
him
looking
back
over
her
shoulder
already
the
mist
was
thinning
close
to
the
bars
she
saw
a
pair
of
sandalled
feet
the
toes
turned
upward
she
glimpsed
the
indistinct
outlines
of
seven
still
prostrate
shapes
now
for
a
steed
swifter
than
the
fastest
horse
ever
bred
in
a
mortal
stable
khemsa
was
saying
will
be
in
afghulistan
before
dawn
an
encounter
in
the
pass
yasmina
devi
could
never
clearly
remember
the
details
of
her
abduction
the
unexpectedness
and
violence
stunned
her
she
had
only
a
confused
impression
of
a
whirl
of
happenings
the
terrifying
grip
of
a
mighty
arm
the
blazing
eyes
of
her
abductor
and
his
hot
breath
burning
on
her
flesh
the
leap
through
the
window
to
the
parapet
the
mad
race
across
battlements
and
roofs
when
the
fear
of
falling
froze
her
the
reckless
descent
of
a
rope
bound
to
a
merlon
he
went
down
almost
at
a
run
his
captive
folded
limply
over
his
brawny
shoulder
all
this
was
a
befuddled
tangle
in
the
devi
mind
she
retained
a
more
vivid
memory
of
him
running
fleetly
into
the
shadows
of
the
trees
carrying
her
like
a
child
and
vaulting
into
the
saddle
of
a
fierce
bhalkhana
stallion
which
reared
and
snorted
then
there
was
a
sensation
of
flying
and
the
racing
hoofs
were
striking
sparks
of
fire
from
the
flinty
road
as
the
stallion
swept
up
the
slopes
as
the
girl
mind
cleared
her
first
sensations
were
furious
rage
and
shame
she
was
appalled
the
rulers
of
the
golden
kingdoms
south
of
the
himelians
were
considered
little
short
of
divine
and
she
was
the
devi
of
vendhya
fright
was
submerged
in
regal
wrath
she
cried
out
furiously
and
began
struggling
she
yasmina
to
be
carried
on
the
of
a
hill
chief
like
a
common
wench
of
the
he
merely
hardened
his
massive
thews
slightly
against
her
writhings
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
experienced
the
coercion
of
superior
physical
strength
his
arms
felt
like
iron
about
her
slender
limbs
he
glanced
down
at
her
and
grinned
hugely
his
teeth
glimmered
whitely
in
the
starlight
the
reins
lay
loose
on
the
stallion
flowing
mane
and
every
thew
and
fiber
of
the
great
beast
strained
as
he
hurtled
along
the
trail
but
conan
sat
easily
almost
carelessly
in
the
saddle
riding
like
a
centaur
dog
she
panted
quivering
with
the
impact
of
shame
anger
and
the
realization
of
helplessness
dare
you
your
life
shall
pay
for
this
where
are
you
taking
me
the
villages
of
afghulistan
he
answered
casting
a
glance
over
his
shoulder
behind
them
beyond
the
slopes
they
had
traversed
torches
were
tossing
on
the
walls
of
the
fortress
and
he
glimpsed
a
flare
of
light
that
meant
the
great
gate
had
been
opened
and
he
laughed
a
boom
gusty
as
the
hill
wind
governor
has
sent
his
riders
after
us
he
laughed
crom
we
will
lead
him
a
merry
chase
what
do
you
think
devi
will
they
pay
seven
lives
for
a
kshatriya
princess
will
send
an
army
to
hang
you
and
your
spawn
of
devils
she
promised
him
with
conviction
he
laughed
gustily
and
shifted
her
to
a
more
comfortable
position
in
his
arms
but
she
took
this
as
a
fresh
outrage
and
renewed
her
vain
struggle
until
she
saw
that
her
efforts
were
only
amusing
him
besides
her
light
silken
garments
floating
on
the
wind
were
being
outrageously
disarranged
by
her
struggles
she
concluded
that
a
scornful
submission
was
the
better
part
of
dignity
and
lapsed
into
a
smoldering
quiescence
she
felt
even
her
anger
being
submerged
by
awe
as
they
entered
the
mouth
of
the
pass
lowering
like
a
black
well
mouth
in
the
blacker
walls
that
rose
like
colossal
ramparts
to
bar
their
way
it
was
as
if
a
gigantic
knife
had
cut
the
zhaibar
out
of
walls
of
solid
rock
on
either
hand
sheer
slopes
pitched
up
for
thousands
of
feet
and
the
mouth
of
the
pass
was
dark
as
hate
even
conan
could
not
see
with
any
accuracy
but
he
knew
the
road
even
by
night
and
knowing
that
armed
men
were
racing
through
the
starlight
after
him
he
did
not
check
the
stallion
speed
the
great
brute
was
not
yet
showing
fatigue
he
thundered
along
the
road
that
followed
the
valley
bed
labored
up
a
slope
swept
along
a
low
ridge
where
treacherous
shale
on
either
hand
lurked
for
the
unwary
and
came
upon
a
trail
that
followed
the
lap
of
the
wall
not
even
conan
could
spy
in
that
darkness
an
ambush
set
by
zhaibar
tribesmen
as
they
swept
past
the
black
mouth
of
a
gorge
that
opened
into
the
pass
a
javelin
swished
through
the
air
and
thudded
home
behind
the
stallion
straining
shoulder
the
great
beast
let
out
his
life
in
a
shuddering
sob
and
stumbled
going
headlong
in
but
conan
had
recognized
the
flight
and
stroke
of
the
javelin
and
he
acted
with
quickness
as
the
horse
fell
he
leaped
clear
holding
the
girl
aloft
to
guard
her
from
striking
boulders
he
lit
on
his
feet
like
a
cat
thrust
her
into
a
cleft
of
rock
and
wheeled
toward
the
outer
darkness
drawing
his
knife
yasmina
confused
by
the
rapidity
of
events
not
quite
sure
just
what
had
happened
saw
a
vague
shape
rush
out
of
the
darkness
bare
feet
slapping
softly
on
the
rock
ragged
garments
whipping
on
the
wind
of
his
haste
she
glimpsed
the
flicker
of
steel
heard
the
lightning
crack
of
stroke
parry
and
and
the
crunch
of
bone
as
conan
long
knife
split
the
other
skull
conan
sprang
back
crouching
in
the
shelter
of
the
rocks
out
in
the
night
men
were
moving
and
a
stentorian
voice
roared
you
dogs
do
you
flinch
in
curse
you
and
take
them
conan
started
peered
into
the
darkness
and
lifted
his
voice
afzal
is
it
you
there
sounded
a
startled
imprecation
and
the
voice
called
warily
is
it
you
conan
the
cimmerian
laughed
forth
you
old
i
slain
one
of
your
men
there
was
movement
among
the
rocks
a
light
flared
dimly
and
then
a
flame
appeared
and
came
bobbing
toward
him
and
as
it
approached
a
fierce
bearded
countenance
grew
out
of
the
darkness
the
man
who
carried
it
held
it
high
thrust
forward
and
craned
his
neck
to
peer
among
the
boulders
it
lighted
the
other
hand
gripped
a
great
curved
tulwar
conan
stepped
forward
sheathing
his
knife
and
the
other
roared
a
greeting
it
is
conan
come
out
of
your
rocks
dogs
it
is
conan
others
pressed
into
the
wavering
circle
of
light
wild
ragged
bearded
men
with
eyes
like
wolves
and
long
blades
in
their
fists
they
did
not
see
yasmina
for
she
was
hidden
by
conan
massive
body
but
peeping
from
her
covert
she
knew
icy
fear
for
the
first
time
that
night
these
men
were
more
like
wolves
than
human
beings
are
you
hunting
in
the
zhaibar
by
night
yar
afzal
conan
demanded
of
the
burly
chief
who
grinned
like
a
bearded
ghoul
knows
what
might
come
up
the
pass
after
dark
we
wazulis
are
but
what
of
you
conan
have
a
prisoner
answered
the
cimmerian
and
moving
aside
he
disclosed
the
cowering
girl
reaching
a
long
arm
into
the
crevice
he
drew
her
trembling
forth
her
imperious
bearing
was
gone
she
stared
timidly
at
the
ring
of
bearded
faces
that
hemmed
her
in
and
was
grateful
for
the
strong
arm
that
clasped
her
possessively
the
torch
was
thrust
close
to
her
and
there
was
a
sucking
intake
of
breath
about
the
ring
is
my
captive
conan
warned
glancing
pointedly
at
the
feet
of
the
man
he
had
slain
just
visible
within
the
ring
of
light
was
taking
her
to
afghulistan
but
now
you
have
slain
my
horse
and
the
kshatriyas
are
close
behind
me
with
us
to
my
village
suggested
yar
afzal
have
horses
hidden
in
the
gorge
they
can
never
follow
us
in
the
darkness
they
are
close
behind
you
you
say
close
that
i
hear
now
the
clink
of
their
hoofs
on
the
flint
answered
conan
grimly
instantly
there
was
movement
the
torch
was
dashed
out
and
the
ragged
shapes
melted
like
phantoms
into
the
darkness
conan
swept
up
the
devi
in
his
arms
and
she
did
not
resist
the
rocky
ground
hurt
her
slim
feet
in
their
soft
slippers
and
she
felt
very
small
and
helpless
in
that
brutish
primordial
blackness
among
those
colossal
nighted
crags
feeling
her
shiver
in
the
wind
that
moaned
down
the
defiles
conan
jerked
a
ragged
cloak
from
its
owner
shoulders
and
wrapped
it
about
her
he
also
hissed
a
warning
in
her
ear
ordering
her
to
make
no
sound
she
did
not
hear
the
distant
clink
of
shod
hoofs
on
rock
that
warned
the
but
she
was
far
too
frightened
to
disobey
in
any
event
she
could
see
nothing
but
a
few
faint
stars
far
above
but
she
knew
by
the
deepening
darkness
when
they
entered
the
gorge
mouth
there
was
a
stir
about
them
the
uneasy
movement
of
horses
a
few
muttered
words
and
conan
mounted
the
horse
of
the
man
he
had
killed
lifting
the
girl
up
in
front
of
him
like
phantoms
except
for
the
click
of
their
hoofs
the
band
swept
away
up
the
shadowy
gorge
behind
them
on
the
trail
they
left
the
dead
horse
and
the
dead
man
which
were
found
less
than
half
an
hour
later
by
the
riders
from
the
fortress
who
recognized
the
man
as
a
wazuli
and
drew
their
own
conclusions
accordingly
yasmina
snuggled
warmly
in
her
captor
arms
grew
drowsy
in
spite
of
herself
the
motion
of
the
horse
though
it
was
uneven
uphill
and
down
yet
possessed
a
certain
rhythm
which
combined
with
weariness
and
emotional
exhaustion
to
force
sleep
upon
her
she
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
or
direction
they
moved
in
soft
thick
darkness
in
which
she
sometimes
glimpsed
vaguely
gigantic
walls
sweeping
up
like
black
ramparts
or
great
crags
shouldering
the
stars
at
times
she
sensed
echoing
depths
beneath
them
or
felt
the
wind
of
dizzy
heights
blowing
cold
about
her
gradually
these
things
faded
into
a
dreamy
unwakefulness
in
which
the
clink
of
hoofs
and
the
creak
of
saddles
were
like
the
irrelevant
sounds
in
a
dream
she
was
vaguely
aware
when
the
motion
ceased
and
she
was
lifted
down
and
carried
a
few
steps
then
she
was
laid
down
on
something
soft
and
rustling
and
something
a
folded
coat
perhaps
was
thrust
under
her
head
and
the
cloak
in
which
she
was
wrapped
was
carefully
tucked
about
her
she
heard
yar
afzal
laugh
rare
prize
conan
fit
mate
for
a
chief
of
the
afghulis
for
me
came
conan
answering
rumble
wench
will
buy
the
lives
of
my
seven
headmen
blast
their
souls
that
was
the
last
she
heard
as
she
sank
into
dreamless
slumber
she
slept
while
armed
men
rode
through
the
dark
hills
and
the
fate
of
kingdoms
hung
in
the
balance
through
the
shadowy
gorges
and
defiles
that
night
there
rang
the
hoofs
of
galloping
horses
and
the
starlight
glimmered
on
helmets
and
curved
blades
until
the
ghoulish
shapes
that
haunt
the
crags
stared
into
the
darkness
from
ravine
and
boulder
and
wondered
what
things
were
afoot
a
band
of
these
sat
gaunt
horses
in
the
black
pitmouth
of
a
gorge
as
the
hurrying
hoofs
swept
past
their
leader
a
man
in
a
helmet
and
cloak
held
up
his
hand
warningly
until
the
riders
had
sped
on
then
he
laughed
softly
must
have
lost
the
trail
or
else
they
have
found
that
conan
has
already
reached
the
afghuli
villages
it
will
take
many
riders
to
smoke
out
that
hive
there
will
be
squadrons
riding
up
the
zhaibar
by
dawn
there
is
fighting
in
the
hills
there
will
be
looting
muttered
a
voice
behind
him
in
the
dialect
of
the
irakzai
will
be
looting
answered
the
man
with
the
helmet
first
it
is
our
business
to
reach
the
valley
of
gurashah
and
await
the
riders
that
will
be
galloping
southward
from
secunderam
before
daylight
he
lifted
his
reins
and
rode
out
of
the
defile
his
men
falling
in
behind
him
thirty
ragged
phantoms
in
the
starlight
the
black
stallion
the
sun
was
well
up
when
yasmina
awoke
she
did
not
start
and
stare
blankly
wondering
where
she
was
she
awoke
with
full
knowledge
of
all
that
had
occurred
her
supple
limbs
were
stiff
from
her
long
ride
and
her
firm
flesh
seemed
to
feel
the
contact
of
the
muscular
arm
that
had
borne
her
so
far
she
was
lying
on
a
sheepskin
covering
a
pallet
of
leaves
on
a
dirt
floor
a
folded
sheepskin
coat
was
under
her
head
and
she
was
wrapped
in
a
ragged
cloak
she
was
in
a
large
room
the
walls
of
which
were
crudely
but
strongly
built
of
uncut
rocks
plastered
with
mud
heavy
beams
supported
a
roof
of
the
same
kind
in
which
showed
a
up
to
which
led
a
ladder
there
were
no
windows
in
the
thick
walls
only
there
was
one
door
a
sturdy
bronze
affair
that
must
have
been
looted
from
some
vendhyan
border
tower
opposite
it
was
a
wide
opening
in
the
wall
with
no
door
but
several
strong
wooden
bars
in
place
beyond
them
yasmina
saw
a
magnificent
black
stallion
munching
a
pile
of
dried
grass
the
building
was
fort
and
stable
in
one
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
a
girl
in
the
vest
and
baggy
trousers
of
a
squatted
beside
a
small
fire
cooking
strips
of
meat
on
an
iron
grid
laid
over
blocks
of
stone
there
was
a
sooty
cleft
in
the
wall
a
few
feet
from
the
floor
and
some
of
the
smoke
found
its
way
out
there
the
rest
floated
in
blue
wisps
about
the
room
the
glanced
at
yasmina
over
her
shoulder
displaying
a
bold
handsome
face
and
then
continued
her
cooking
voices
boomed
outside
then
the
door
was
kicked
open
and
conan
strode
in
he
looked
more
enormous
than
ever
with
the
morning
sunlight
behind
him
and
yasmina
noted
some
details
that
had
escaped
her
the
night
before
his
garments
were
clean
and
not
ragged
the
broad
bakhariot
girdle
that
supported
his
knife
in
its
ornamented
scabbard
would
have
matched
the
robes
of
a
prince
and
there
was
a
glint
of
fine
turanian
mail
under
his
shirt
captive
is
awake
conan
said
the
wazuli
girl
and
he
grunted
strode
up
to
the
fire
and
swept
the
strips
of
mutton
off
into
a
stone
dish
the
squatting
girl
laughed
up
at
him
with
some
spicy
jest
and
he
grinned
wolfishly
and
hooking
a
toe
under
her
haunches
tumbled
her
sprawling
onto
the
floor
she
seemed
to
derive
considerable
amusement
from
this
bit
of
rough
but
conan
paid
no
more
heed
to
her
producing
a
great
hunk
of
bread
from
somewhere
with
a
copper
jug
of
wine
he
carried
the
lot
to
yasmina
who
had
risen
from
her
pallet
and
was
regarding
him
doubtfully
fare
for
a
devi
girl
but
our
best
he
grunted
will
fill
your
belly
at
least
he
set
the
platter
on
the
floor
and
she
was
suddenly
aware
of
a
ravenous
hunger
making
no
comment
she
seated
herself
on
the
floor
and
taking
the
dish
in
her
lap
she
began
to
eat
using
her
fingers
which
were
all
she
had
in
the
way
of
table
utensils
after
all
adaptability
is
one
of
the
tests
of
true
aristocracy
conan
stood
looking
down
at
her
his
thumbs
hooked
in
his
girdle
he
never
sat
after
the
eastern
fashion
am
i
she
asked
abruptly
the
hut
of
yar
afzal
the
chief
of
the
khurum
wazulis
he
answered
lies
a
good
many
miles
farther
on
to
the
west
we
hide
here
awhile
the
kshatriyas
are
beating
up
the
hills
for
you
several
of
their
squads
have
been
cut
up
by
the
tribes
already
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
you
until
chunder
shan
is
willing
to
trade
back
my
seven
he
grunted
of
the
wazulis
are
crushing
ink
out
of
leaves
and
after
a
while
you
can
write
a
letter
to
the
governor
a
touch
of
her
old
imperious
wrath
shook
her
as
she
thought
how
maddeningly
her
plans
had
gone
awry
leaving
her
captive
of
the
very
man
she
had
plotted
to
get
into
her
power
she
flung
down
the
dish
with
the
remnants
of
her
meal
and
sprang
to
her
feet
tense
with
anger
will
not
write
a
letter
if
you
do
not
take
me
back
they
will
hang
your
seven
men
and
a
thousand
more
besides
the
wazuli
girl
laughed
mockingly
conan
scowled
and
then
the
door
opened
and
yar
afzal
came
swaggering
in
the
wazuli
chief
was
as
tall
as
conan
and
of
greater
girth
but
he
looked
fat
and
slow
beside
the
hard
compactness
of
the
cimmerian
he
plucked
his
beard
and
stared
meaningly
at
the
wazuli
girl
and
that
wench
rose
and
scurried
out
without
delay
then
yar
afzal
turned
to
his
guest
damnable
people
murmur
conan
quoth
he
wish
me
to
murder
you
and
take
the
girl
to
hold
for
ransom
they
say
that
anyone
can
tell
by
her
garments
that
she
is
a
noble
lady
they
say
why
should
the
afghuli
dogs
profit
by
her
when
it
is
the
people
who
take
the
risk
of
guarding
her
me
your
horse
said
conan
take
her
and
go
boomed
yar
afzal
you
think
i
ca
handle
my
own
people
i
have
them
dancing
in
their
shirts
if
they
cross
me
they
do
love
you
or
any
other
outlander
but
you
saved
my
life
once
and
i
will
not
forget
come
out
though
conan
a
scout
has
returned
conan
hitched
at
his
girdle
and
followed
the
chief
outside
they
closed
the
door
after
them
and
yasmina
peeped
through
a
she
looked
out
on
a
level
space
before
the
hut
at
the
farther
end
of
that
space
there
was
a
cluster
of
mud
and
stone
huts
and
she
saw
naked
children
playing
among
the
boulders
and
the
slim
erect
women
of
the
hills
going
about
their
tasks
directly
before
the
chiefs
hut
a
circle
of
hairy
ragged
men
squatted
facing
the
door
conan
and
yar
afzal
stood
a
few
paces
before
the
door
and
between
them
and
the
ring
of
warriors
another
man
sat
this
one
was
addressing
his
chief
in
the
harsh
accents
of
the
wazuli
which
yasmina
could
scarcely
understand
though
as
part
of
her
royal
education
she
had
been
taught
the
languages
of
iranistan
and
the
kindred
tongues
of
ghulistan
talked
with
a
dagozai
who
saw
the
riders
last
night
said
the
scout
was
lurking
near
when
they
came
to
the
spot
where
we
ambushed
the
lord
conan
he
overheard
their
speech
chunder
shan
was
with
them
they
found
the
dead
horse
and
one
of
the
men
recognized
it
as
conan
then
they
found
the
man
conan
slew
and
knew
him
for
a
wazuli
it
seemed
to
them
that
conan
had
been
slain
and
the
girl
taken
by
the
wazuli
so
they
turned
aside
from
their
purpose
of
following
to
afghulistan
but
they
did
not
know
from
which
village
the
dead
man
was
come
and
we
had
left
no
trail
a
kshatriya
could
follow
they
rode
to
the
nearest
wazuli
village
which
was
the
village
of
jugra
and
burnt
it
and
slew
many
of
the
people
but
the
men
of
khojur
came
upon
them
in
darkness
and
slew
some
of
them
and
wounded
the
governor
so
the
survivors
retired
down
the
zhaibar
in
the
darkness
before
dawn
but
they
returned
with
reinforcements
before
sunrise
and
there
has
been
skirmishing
and
fighting
in
the
hills
all
morning
it
is
said
that
a
great
army
is
being
raised
to
sweep
the
hills
about
the
zhaibar
the
tribes
are
whetting
their
knives
and
laying
ambushes
in
every
pass
from
here
to
gurashah
valley
moreover
kerim
shah
has
returned
to
the
hills
a
grunt
went
around
the
circle
and
yasmina
leaned
closer
to
the
at
the
name
she
had
begun
to
mistrust
went
he
demanded
yar
afzal
dagozai
did
not
know
with
him

thirty
irakzai
of
the
lower
villages
they
rode
into
the
hills
and
disappeared

in

semicircle

to
squat
on
our
haunches
until
they
smoke
us
out
they
will
learn
at
last
in
which
wazuli

out

come
grunted
yar
afzal
can
hold
the
defiles
against
a
host
one
of
the
men
leaped
up
and
shook
his
fist
at
conan
we
to
take
all
the
risks
while
he
reaps
the
rewards
he
howled
we
to
fight
his
battles
for
him
with
a
stride
conan
reached
him
and
bent
slightly
to
stare
full
into
his
hairy
face
the
cimmerian
had
not
drawn
his
long
knife
but
his
left
hand
grasped
the
scabbard
jutting
the
hilt
suggestively
forward
ask
no
man
to
fight
my
battles
he
said
softly
your
blade
if
you
dare
you
yapping
dog
the
wazuli
started
back
snarling
like
a
cat
to
touch
me
and
here
are
fifty
men
to
rend
you
apart
he
screeched
roared
yar
afzal
his
face
purpling
with
wrath
his
whiskers
bristled
his
belly
swelled
with
his
rage
you
chief
of
khurum
do
the
wazulis
take
orders
from
yar
afzal
or
from
a
cur
the
man
cringed
before
his
invincible
chief
and
yar
afzal
striding
up
to
him
seized
him
by
the
throat
and
choked
him
until
his
face
was
turning
black
then
he
hurled
the
man
savagely
against
the
ground
and
stood
over
him
with
his
tulwar
in
his
hand
there
any
who
questions
my
authority
he
roared
and
his
warriors
looked
down
sullenly
as
his
bellicose
glare
swept
their
semicircle
yar
afzal
grunted
scornfully
and
sheathed
his
weapon
with
a
gesture
that
was
the
apex
of
insult
then
he
kicked
the
fallen
agitator
with
a
concentrated
vindictiveness
that
brought
howls
from
his
victim
down
the
valley
to
the
watchers
on
the
heights
and
bring
word
if
they
have
seen
anything
commanded
yar
afzal
and
the
man
went
shaking
with
fear
and
grinding
his
teeth
with
fury
yar
afzal
then
seated
himself
ponderously
on
a
stone
growling
in
his
beard
conan
stood
near
him
legs
braced
apart
thumbs
hooked
in
his
girdle
narrowly
watching
the
assembled
warriors
they
stared
at
him
sullenly
not
daring
to
brave
yar
afzal
fury
but
hating
the
foreigner
as
only
a
hillman
can
hate
listen
to
me
you
sons
of
nameless
dogs
while
i
tell
you
what
the
lord
conan
and
i
have
planned
to
fool
the
kshatriyas
the
boom
of
yar
afzal
voice
followed
the
discomfited
warrior
as
he
slunk
away
from
the
assembly
the
man
passed
by
the
cluster
of
huts
where
women
who
had
seen
his
defeat
laughed
at
him
and
called
stinging
comments
and
hastened
on
along
the
trail
that
wound
among
spurs
and
rocks
toward
the
valley
head
just
as
he
rounded
the
first
turn
that
took
him
out
of
sight
of
the
village
he
stopped
short
gaping
stupidly
he
had
not
believed
it
possible
for
a
stranger
to
enter
the
valley
of
khurum
without
being
detected
by
the
watchers
along
the
heights
yet
a
man
sat
on
a
low
ledge
beside
the
path
a
man
in
a
robe
and
a
green
turban
the
wazuli
mouth
gaped
for
a
yell
and
his
hand
leaped
to
his
but
at
that
instant
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
stranger
and
the
cry
died
in
his
throat
his
fingers
went
limp
he
stood
like
a
statue
his
own
eyes
glazed
and
vacant
for
minutes
the
scene
held
motionless
then
the
man
on
the
ledge
drew
a
cryptic
symbol
in
the
dust
on
the
rock
with
his
forefinger
the
wazuli
did
not
see
him
place
anything
within
the
compass
of
that
emblem
but
presently
something
gleamed
there
a
round
shiny
black
ball
that
looked
like
polished
jade
the
man
in
the
green
turban
took
this
up
and
tossed
it
to
the
wazuli
who
mechanically
caught
it
this
to
yar
afzal
he
said
and
the
wazuli
turned
like
an
automaton
and
went
back
along
the
path
holding
the
black
jade
ball
in
his
outstretched
hand
he
did
not
even
turn
his
head
to
the
renewed
jeers
of
the
women
as
he
passed
the
huts
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
the
man
on
the
ledge
gazed
after
him
with
a
cryptic
smile
a
girl
head
rose
above
the
rim
of
the
ledge
and
she
looked
at
him
with
admiration
and
a
touch
of
fear
that
had
not
been
present
the
night
before
did
you
do
that
she
asked
he
ran
his
fingers
through
her
dark
locks
caressingly
you
still
dizzy
from
your
flight
on
the
that
you
doubt
my
wisdom
he
laughed
long
as
yar
afzal
lives
conan
will
bide
safe
among
the
wazuli
their
knives
are
sharp
and
there
are
many
of
them
what
i
plot
will
be
safer
even
for
me
than
to
seek
to
slay
him
and
take
her
from
among
them
it
takes
no
wizard
to
predict
what
the
wazulis
will
do
and
what
conan
will
do
when
my
victim
hands
the
globe
of
yezud
to
the
chief
of
khurum
back
before
the
hut
yar
afzal
halted
in
the
midst
of
some
tirade
surprized
and
displeased
to
see
the
man
he
had
sent
up
the
valley
pushing
his
way
through
the
throng
bade
you
go
to
the
watchers
the
chief
bellowed
have
not
had
time
to
come
from
them
the
other
did
not
reply
he
stood
woodenly
staring
vacantly
into
the
chief
face
his
palm
outstretched
holding
the
jade
ball
conan
looking
over
yar
afzal
shoulder
murmured
something
and
reached
to
touch
the
chief
arm
but
as
he
did
so
yar
afzal
in
a
paroxysm
of
anger
struck
the
man
with
his
clenched
fist
and
felled
him
like
an
ox
as
he
fell
the
jade
sphere
rolled
to
yar
afzal
foot
and
the
chief
seeming
to
see
it
for
the
first
time
bent
and
picked
it
up
the
men
staring
perplexedly
at
their
senseless
comrade
saw
their
chief
bend
but
they
did
not
see
what
he
picked
up
from
the
ground
yar
afzal
straightened
glanced
at
the
jade
and
made
a
motion
to
thrust
it
into
his
girdle
that
fool
to
his
hut
he
growled
has
the
look
of
a
he
returned
me
a
blank
stare
i
in
his
right
hand
moving
toward
his
girdle
he
had
suddenly
felt
movement
where
movement
should
not
be
his
voice
died
away
as
he
stood
and
glared
at
nothing
and
inside
his
clenched
right
hand
he
felt
the
quivering
of
of
of
he
no
longer
held
a
smooth
shining
sphere
in
his
fingers
and
he
dared
not
look
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
and
he
could
not
open
his
hand
his
astonished
warriors
saw
yar
afzal
eyes
distend
the
color
ebb
from
his
face
then
suddenly
a
bellow
of
agony
burst
from
his
bearded
lips
he
swayed
and
fell
as
if
struck
by
lightning
his
right
arm
tossed
out
in
front
of
him
face
down
he
lay
and
from
between
his
opening
fingers
crawled
a
spider
a
hideous
black
monster
whose
body
shone
like
black
jade
the
men
yelled
and
gave
back
suddenly
and
the
creature
scuttled
into
a
crevice
of
the
rocks
and
disappeared
the
warriors
started
up
glaring
wildly
and
a
voice
rose
above
their
clamor
a
voice
of
command
which
came
from
none
knew
where
afterward
each
man
there
who
still
lived
denied
that
he
had
shouted
but
all
there
heard
it
afzal
is
dead
kill
the
outlander
that
shout
focused
their
whirling
minds
as
one
doubt
bewilderment
and
fear
vanished
in
the
uproaring
surge
of
the
a
furious
yell
rent
the
skies
as
the
tribesmen
responded
instantly
to
the
suggestion
they
came
headlong
across
the
open
space
cloaks
flapping
eyes
blazing
knives
lifted
conan
action
was
as
quick
as
theirs
as
the
voice
shouted
he
sprang
for
the
hut
door
but
they
were
closer
to
him
than
he
was
to
the
door
and
with
one
foot
on
the
sill
he
had
to
wheel
and
parry
the
swipe
of
a
blade
he
split
the
man
skull
ducked
another
swinging
knife
and
gutted
the
wielder
felled
a
man
with
his
left
fist
and
stabbed
another
in
the
belly
and
heaved
back
mightily
against
the
closed
door
with
his
shoulders
hacking
blades
were
nicking
chips
out
of
the
jambs
about
his
ears
but
the
door
flew
open
under
the
impact
of
his
shoulders
and
he
went
stumbling
backward
into
the
room
a
bearded
tribesman
thrusting
with
all
his
fury
as
conan
sprang
back
overreached
and
pitched
through
the
doorway
conan
stopped
grasped
the
slack
of
his
garments
and
hauled
him
clear
and
slammed
the
door
in
the
faces
of
the
men
who
came
surging
into
it
bones
snapped
under
the
impact
and
the
next
instant
conan
slammed
the
bolts
into
place
and
whirled
with
desperate
haste
to
meet
the
man
who
sprang
from
the
floor
and
tore
into
action
like
a
madman
yasmina
cowered
in
a
corner
staring
in
horror
as
the
two
men
fought
back
and
forth
across
the
room
almost
trampling
her
at
times
the
flash
and
clangor
of
their
blades
filled
the
room
and
outside
the
mob
clamored
like
a
hacking
deafeningly
at
the
bronze
door
with
their
long
knives
and
dashing
huge
rocks
against
it
somebody
fetched
a
tree
trunk
and
the
door
began
to
stagger
under
the
thunderous
assault
yasmina
clasped
her
ears
staring
wildly
violence
and
fury
within
cataclysmic
madness
without
the
stallion
in
his
stall
neighed
and
reared
thundering
with
his
heels
against
the
walls
he
wheeled
and
launched
his
hoofs
through
the
bars
just
as
the
tribesman
backing
away
from
conan
murderous
swipes
stumbled
against
them
his
spine
cracked
in
three
places
like
a
rotten
branch
and
he
was
hurled
headlong
against
the
cimmerian
bearing
him
backward
so
that
they
both
crashed
to
the
beaten
floor
yasmina
cried
out
and
ran
forward
to
her
dazed
sight
it
seemed
that
both
were
slain
she
reached
them
just
as
conan
threw
aside
the
corpse
and
rose
she
caught
his
arm
trembling
from
head
to
foot
you
live
i
thought
i
thought
you
were
dead
he
glanced
down
at
her
quickly
into
the
pale
upturned
face
and
the
wide
staring
dark
eyes
are
you
trembling
he
demanded
should
you
care
if
i
live
or
die
a
vestige
of
her
poise
returned
to
her
and
she
drew
away
making
a
rather
pitiful
attempt
at
playing
the
devi
are
preferable
to
those
wolves
howling
without
she
answered
gesturing
toward
the
door
the
stone
sill
of
which
was
beginning
to
splinter
away
wo
hold
long
he
muttered
then
turned
and
went
swiftly
to
the
stall
of
the
stallion
yasmina
clenched
her
hands
and
caught
her
breath
as
she
saw
him
tear
aside
the
splintered
bars
and
go
into
the
stall
with
the
maddened
beast
the
stallion
reared
above
him
neighing
terribly
hoofs
lifted
eyes
and
teeth
flashing
and
ears
laid
back
but
conan
leaped
and
caught
his
mane
with
a
display
of
sheer
strength
that
seemed
impossible
and
dragged
the
beast
down
on
his
forelegs
the
steed
snorted
and
quivered
but
stood
still
while
the
man
bridled
him
and
clapped
on
the
saddle
with
the
wide
silver
stirrups
wheeling
the
beast
around
in
the
stall
conan
called
quickly
to
yasmina
and
the
girl
came
sidling
nervously
past
the
stallion
heels
conan
was
working
at
the
stone
wall
talking
swiftly
as
he
worked
secret
door
in
the
wall
here
that
not
even
the
wazuli
know
about
yar
afzal
showed
it
to
me
once
when
he
was
drunk
it
opens
out
into
the
mouth
of
the
ravine
behind
the
hut
ha
as
he
tugged
at
a
projection
that
seemed
casual
a
whole
section
of
the
wall
slid
back
on
oiled
iron
runners
looking
through
the
girl
saw
a
narrow
defile
opening
in
a
sheer
stone
cliff
within
a
few
feet
of
the
hut
back
wall
then
conan
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
hauled
her
up
before
him
behind
them
the
great
door
groaned
like
a
living
thing
and
crashed
in
and
a
yell
rang
to
the
roof
as
the
entrance
was
instantly
flooded
with
hairy
faces
and
knives
in
hairy
fists
and
then
the
great
stallion
went
through
the
wall
like
a
javelin
from
a
catapult
and
thundered
into
the
defile
running
low
foam
flying
from
the
that
move
came
as
an
absolute
surprize
to
the
wazulis
it
was
a
surprize
too
to
those
stealing
down
the
ravine
it
happened
so
quickly
the
charge
of
the
great
horse
that
a
man
in
a
green
turban
was
unable
to
get
out
of
the
way
he
went
down
under
the
frantic
hoofs
and
a
girl
screamed
conan
got
one
glimpse
of
her
as
they
thundered
by
a
slim
dark
girl
in
silk
trousers
and
a
jeweled
flattening
herself
against
the
ravine
wall
then
the
black
horse
and
his
riders
were
gone
up
the
gorge
like
the
spume
blown
before
a
storm
and
the
men
who
came
tumbling
through
the
wall
into
the
defile
after
them
met
that
which
changed
their
yells
of
to
shrill
screams
of
fear
and
death
the
mountain
of
the
black
seers
now
yasmina
was
trying
to
sit
erect
on
the
rocking
clutching
her
captor
she
was
conscious
of
a
recognition
of
shame
that
she
should
not
find
unpleasant
the
feel
of
his
muscular
flesh
under
her
fingers
afghulistan
he
answered
a
perilous
road
but
the
stallion
will
carry
us
easily
unless
we
fall
in
with
some
of
your
friends
or
my
tribal
enemies
now
that
yar
afzal
is
dead
those
damned
wazulis
will
be
on
our
heels
i
surprized
we
have
sighted
them
behind
us
already
was
that
man
you
rode
down
she
asked
do
know
i
never
saw
him
before
he
no
ghuli
that
certain
what
the
devil
he
was
doing
there
is
more
than
i
can
say
there
was
a
girl
with
him
too
her
gaze
was
shadowed
can
not
understand
that
that
girl
was
my
maid
gitara
do
you
suppose
she
was
coming
to
aid
me
that
the
man
was
a
friend
if
so
the
wazulis
have
captured
them
both
he
answered
nothing
we
can
do
if
we
go
back
skin
us
both
i
ca
understand
how
a
girl
like
that
could
get
this
far
into
the
mountains
with
only
one
man
and
he
a
robed
scholar
for
what
he
looked
like
there
something
infernally
queer
in
all
this
that
fellow
yar
afzal
beat
and
sent
away
he
moved
like
a
man
walking
in
his
sleep
i
seen
the
priests
of
zamora
perform
their
abominable
rituals
in
their
forbidden
temples
and
their
victims
had
a
stare
like
that
man
the
priests
looked
into
their
eyes
and
muttered
incantations
and
then
the
people
became
the
walking
dead
men
with
glassy
eyes
doing
as
they
were
ordered
then
i
saw
what
the
fellow
had
in
his
hand
which
yar
afzal
picked
up
it
was
like
a
big
black
jade
bead
such
as
the
temple
girls
of
yezud
wear
when
they
dance
before
the
black
stone
spider
which
is
their
god
yar
afzal
held
it
in
his
hand
and
he
did
pick
up
anything
else
yet
when
he
fell
dead
a
spider
like
the
god
at
yezud
only
smaller
ran
out
of
his
fingers
and
then
when
the
wazulis
stood
uncertain
there
a
voice
cried
out
for
them
to
kill
me
and
i
know
that
voice
did
come
from
any
of
the
warriors
nor
from
the
women
who
watched
by
the
huts
it
seemed
to
come
from
yasmina
did
not
reply
she
glanced
at
the
stark
outlines
of
the
mountains
all
about
them
and
shuddered
her
soul
shrank
from
their
gaunt
brutality
this
was
a
grim
naked
land
where
anything
might
happen
traditions
invested
it
with
shuddery
horror
for
anyone
born
in
the
hot
luxuriant
southern
plains
the
sun
was
high
beating
down
with
fierce
heat
yet
the
wind
that
blew
in
fitful
gusts
seemed
to
sweep
off
slopes
of
ice
once
she
heard
a
strange
rushing
above
them
that
was
not
the
sweep
of
the
wind
and
from
the
way
conan
looked
up
she
knew
it
was
not
a
common
sound
to
him
either
she
thought
that
a
strip
of
the
cold
blue
sky
was
momentarily
blurred
as
if
some
all
but
invisible
object
had
swept
between
it
and
herself
but
she
could
not
be
sure
neither
made
any
comment
but
conan
loosened
his
knife
in
his
scabbard
they
were
following
a
faintly
marked
path
dipping
down
into
ravines
so
deep
the
sun
never
struck
bottom
laboring
up
steep
slopes
where
loose
shale
threatened
to
slide
from
beneath
their
feet
and
following
ridges
with
echoing
depths
on
either
hand
the
sun
had
passed
its
zenith
when
they
crossed
a
narrow
trail
winding
among
the
crags
conan
reined
the
horse
aside
and
followed
it
southward
going
almost
at
right
angles
to
their
former
course
galzai
village
is
at
one
end
of
this
trail
he
explained
women
follow
it
to
a
well
for
water
you
need
new
garments
glancing
down
at
her
filmy
attire
yasmina
agreed
with
him
her
slippers
were
in
tatters
her
robes
and
silken
torn
to
shreds
that
scarcely
held
together
decently
garments
meant
for
the
streets
of
peshkhauri
were
scarcely
appropriate
for
the
crags
of
the
himelians
coming
to
a
crook
in
the
trail
conan
dismounted
helped
yasmina
down
and
waited
presently
he
nodded
though
she
heard
nothing
woman
coming
along
the
trail
he
remarked
in
sudden
panic
she
clutched
his
arm
will
not
not
kill
her
do
kill
women
ordinarily
he
grunted
some
of
the
are
no
he
grinned
as
at
a
huge
jest
crom
i
for
her
clothes
how
is
that
he
displayed
a
large
handful
of
gold
coins
and
replaced
all
but
the
largest
she
nodded
much
relieved
it
was
perhaps
natural
for
men
to
slay
and
die
her
flesh
crawled
at
the
thought
of
watching
the
butchery
of
a
woman
presently
a
woman
appeared
around
the
crook
of
the
trail
a
tall
slim
galzai
girl
straight
as
a
young
sapling
bearing
a
great
empty
gourd
she
stopped
short
and
the
gourd
fell
from
her
hands
when
she
saw
them
she
wavered
as
though
to
run
then
realized
that
conan
was
too
close
to
her
to
allow
her
to
escape
and
so
stood
still
staring
at
them
with
a
mixed
expression
of
fear
and
curiosity
conan
displayed
the
gold
coin
you
will
give
this
woman
your
garments
he
said
will
give
you
this
money
the
response
was
instant
the
girl
smiled
broadly
with
surprize
and
delight
and
with
the
disdain
of
a
for
prudish
conventions
promptly
yanked
off
her
sleeveless
embroidered
vest
slipped
down
her
wide
trousers
and
stepped
out
of
them
twitched
off
her
shirt
and
kicked
off
her
sandals
bundling
them
all
in
a
bunch
she
proffered
them
to
conan
who
handed
them
to
the
astonished
devi
behind
that
rock
and
put
these
on
he
directed
further
proving
himself
no
native
hillman
your
robes
up
into
a
bundle
and
bring
them
to
me
when
you
come
out
money
clamored
the
stretching
out
her
hands
eagerly
gold
you
promised
me
conan
flipped
the
coin
to
her
she
caught
it
bit
then
thrust
it
into
her
hair
bent
and
caught
up
the
gourd
and
went
on
down
the
path
as
devoid
of
as
of
garments
conan
waited
with
some
impatience
while
the
devi
for
the
first
time
in
her
pampered
life
dressed
herself
when
she
stepped
from
behind
the
rock
he
swore
in
surprize
and
she
felt
a
curious
rush
of
emotions
at
the
unrestrained
admiration
burning
in
his
fierce
blue
eyes
she
felt
shame
embarrassment
yet
a
stimulation
of
vanity
she
had
never
before
experienced
and
a
tingling
when
meeting
the
impact
of
his
eyes
he
laid
a
heavy
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
turned
her
about
staring
avidly
at
her
from
all
angles
crom
said
he
those
smoky
mystic
robes
you
were
aloof
and
cold
and
far
off
as
a
star
now
you
are
a
woman
of
warm
flesh
and
blood
you
went
behind
that
rock
as
the
devi
of
vendhya
you
come
out
as
a
though
a
thousand
times
more
beautiful
than
any
wench
of
the
zhaibar
you
were
a
goddess
now
you
are
real
he
spanked
her
resoundingly
and
she
recognizing
this
as
merely
another
expression
of
admiration
did
not
feel
outraged
it
was
indeed
as
if
the
changing
of
her
garments
had
wrought
a
change
in
her
personality
the
feelings
and
sensations
she
had
suppressed
rose
to
domination
in
her
now
as
if
the
queenly
robes
she
had
cast
off
had
been
material
shackles
and
inhibitions
but
conan
in
his
renewed
admiration
did
not
forget
that
peril
lurked
all
about
them
the
farther
they
drew
away
from
the
region
of
the
zhaibar
the
less
likely
he
was
to
encounter
any
kshatriya
troops
on
the
other
hand
he
had
been
listening
all
throughout
their
flight
for
sounds
that
would
tell
him
the
vengeful
wazulis
of
khurum
were
on
their
heels
swinging
the
devi
up
he
followed
her
into
the
saddle
and
again
reined
the
stallion
westward
the
bundle
of
garments
she
had
given
him
he
hurled
over
a
cliff
to
fall
into
the
depths
of
a
gorge
did
you
do
that
she
asked
did
you
not
give
them
to
the
girl
riders
from
peshkhauri
are
combing
these
hills
he
said
be
ambushed
and
harried
at
every
turn
and
by
way
of
reprisal
destroy
every
village
they
can
take
they
may
turn
westward
any
time
if
they
found
a
girl
wearing
your
garments
they
torture
her
into
talking
and
she
might
put
them
on
my
trail
will
she
do
asked
yasmina
back
to
her
village
and
tell
her
people
that
a
stranger
attacked
her
he
answered
have
them
on
our
track
all
right
but
she
had
to
go
on
and
get
the
water
first
if
she
dared
go
back
without
it
they
whip
the
skin
off
her
that
gives
us
a
long
start
they
never
catch
us
by
nightfall
we
cross
the
afghuli
border
are
no
paths
or
signs
of
human
habitation
in
these
parts
she
commented
for
the
himelians
this
region
seems
singularly
deserted
we
have
not
seen
a
trail
since
we
left
the
one
where
we
met
the
galzai
woman
for
answer
he
pointed
to
the
northwest
where
she
glimpsed
a
peak
in
a
notch
of
the
crags
grunted
conan
tribes
build
their
villages
as
far
from
the
mountain
as
they
can
she
was
instantly
rigid
with
attention
she
whispered
mountain
of
the
black
seers
they
say
he
answered
is
as
near
as
i
ever
approached
it
i
have
swung
north
to
avoid
any
kshatriya
troops
that
might
be
prowling
through
the
hills
the
regular
trail
from
khurum
to
afghulistan
lies
farther
south
this
is
an
ancient
one
and
seldom
used
she
was
staring
intently
at
the
distant
peak
her
nails
bit
into
her
pink
palms
long
would
it
take
to
reach
yimsha
from
this
point
the
rest
of
the
day
and
all
night
he
answered
and
grinned
you
want
to
go
there
by
crom
it
no
place
for
an
ordinary
human
from
what
the
say
do
they
not
gather
and
destroy
the
devils
that
inhabit
it
she
demanded
out
wizards
with
swords
anyway
they
never
interfere
with
people
unless
the
people
interfere
with
them
i
never
saw
one
of
them
though
i
talked
with
men
who
swore
they
had
they
say
they
glimpsed
people
from
the
tower
among
the
crags
at
sunset
or
sunrise
tall
silent
men
in
black
robes
you
be
afraid
to
attack
them
the
idea
seemed
a
new
one
to
him
if
they
imposed
upon
me
it
would
be
my
life
or
theirs
but
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
i
came
to
these
mountains
to
raise
a
following
of
human
beings
not
to
war
with
wizards
yasmina
did
not
at
once
reply
she
stared
at
the
peak
as
at
a
human
enemy
feeling
all
her
anger
and
hatred
stir
in
her
bosom
anew
and
another
feeling
began
to
take
dim
shape
she
had
plotted
to
hurl
against
the
masters
of
yimsha
the
man
in
whose
arms
she
was
now
carried
perhaps
there
was
another
way
besides
the
method
she
had
planned
to
accomplish
her
purpose
she
could
not
mistake
the
look
that
was
beginning
to
dawn
in
this
wild
man
eyes
as
they
rested
on
her
kingdoms
have
fallen
when
a
woman
slim
white
hands
pulled
the
strings
of
destiny
suddenly
she
stiffened
pointing
just
visible
on
the
distant
peak
there
hung
a
cloud
of
peculiar
aspect
it
was
a
frosty
crimson
in
color
veined
with
sparkling
gold
this
cloud
was
in
motion
it
rotated
and
as
it
whirled
it
contracted
it
dwindled
to
a
spinning
taper
that
flashed
in
the
sun
and
suddenly
it
detached
itself
from
the
peak
floated
out
over
the
void
like
a
feather
and
became
invisible
against
the
cerulean
sky
could
that
have
been
asked
the
girl
uneasily
as
a
shoulder
of
rock
shut
the
distant
mountain
from
view
the
phenomenon
had
been
disturbing
even
in
its
beauty
call
it
yimsha
carpet
whatever
that
means
answered
conan
seen
five
hundred
of
them
running
as
if
the
devil
were
at
their
heels
to
hide
themselves
in
caves
and
crags
because
they
saw
that
crimson
cloud
float
up
from
the
peak
what
in
they
had
advanced
through
a
narrow
gash
between
turreted
walls
and
emerged
upon
a
broad
ledge
flanked
by
a
series
of
rugged
slopes
on
one
hand
and
a
gigantic
precipice
on
the
other
the
dim
trail
followed
this
ledge
bent
around
a
shoulder
and
reappeared
at
intervals
far
below
working
a
tedious
way
downward
and
emerging
from
the
cut
that
opened
upon
the
ledge
the
black
stallion
halted
short
snorting
conan
urged
him
on
impatiently
and
the
horse
snorted
and
threw
his
head
up
and
down
quivering
and
straining
as
if
against
an
invisible
barrier
conan
swore
and
swung
off
lifting
yasmina
down
with
him
he
went
forward
with
a
hand
thrown
out
before
him
as
if
expecting
to
encounter
unseen
resistance
but
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
him
though
when
he
tried
to
lead
the
horse
it
neighed
shrilly
and
jerked
back
then
yasmina
cried
out
and
conan
wheeled
hand
starting
to
neither
of
them
had
seen
him
come
but
he
stood
there
with
his
arms
folded
a
man
in
a
robe
and
a
green
turban
conan
grunted
with
surprize
to
recognize
the
man
the
stallion
had
spurned
in
the
ravine
outside
the
wazuli
village
the
devil
are
you
he
demanded
the
man
did
not
answer
conan
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
wide
fixed
and
of
a
peculiar
luminous
quality
and
those
eyes
held
his
like
a
magnet
khemsa
sorcery
was
based
on
hypnotism
as
is
the
case
with
most
eastern
magic
the
way
has
been
prepared
for
the
hypnotist
for
untold
centuries
of
generations
who
have
lived
and
died
in
the
firm
conviction
of
the
reality
and
power
of
hypnotism
building
up
by
mass
thought
and
practise
a
colossal
though
intangible
atmosphere
against
which
the
individual
steeped
in
the
traditions
of
the
land
finds
himself
helpless
but
conan
was
not
a
son
of
the
east
its
traditions
were
meaningless
to
him
he
was
the
product
of
an
utterly
alien
atmosphere
hypnotism
was
not
even
a
myth
in
cimmeria
the
heritage
that
prepared
a
native
of
the
east
for
submission
to
the
mesmerist
was
not
his
he
was
aware
of
what
khemsa
was
trying
to
do
to
him
but
he
felt
the
impact
of
the
man
uncanny
power
only
as
a
vague
impulsion
a
tugging
and
pulling
that
he
could
shake
off
as
a
man
shakes
spiderwebs
from
his
garments
aware
of
hostility
and
black
magic
he
ripped
out
his
long
knife
and
lunged
as
quick
on
his
feet
as
a
mountain
lion
but
hypnotism
was
not
all
of
khemsa
magic
yasmina
watching
did
not
see
by
what
roguery
of
movement
or
illusion
the
man
in
the
green
turban
avoided
the
terrible
disembowelling
thrust
but
the
keen
blade
whickered
between
side
and
lifted
arm
and
to
yasmina
it
seemed
that
khemsa
merely
brushed
his
open
palm
lightly
against
conan
but
the
cimmerian
went
down
like
a
slain
ox
yet
conan
was
not
dead
breaking
his
fall
with
his
left
hand
he
slashed
at
khemsa
legs
even
as
he
went
down
and
the
rakhsha
avoided
the
swipe
only
by
a
most
unwizardly
bound
backward
then
yasmina
cried
out
sharply
as
she
saw
a
woman
she
recognized
as
gitara
glide
out
from
among
the
rocks
and
come
up
to
the
man
the
greeting
died
in
the
devi
throat
as
she
saw
the
malevolence
in
the
girl
beautiful
face
conan
was
rising
slowly
shaken
and
dazed
by
the
cruel
craft
of
that
blow
which
delivered
with
an
art
forgotten
of
men
before
atlantis
sank
would
have
broken
like
a
rotten
twig
the
neck
of
a
lesser
man
khemsa
gazed
at
him
cautiously
and
a
trifle
uncertainly
the
rakhsha
had
learned
the
full
flood
of
his
own
power
when
he
faced
at
bay
the
knives
of
the
maddened
wazulis
in
the
ravine
behind
khurum
village
but
the
cimmerian
resistance
had
perhaps
shaken
his
confidence
a
trifle
sorcery
thrives
on
success
not
on
failure
he
stepped
forward
lifting
his
hand
then
halted
as
if
frozen
head
tilted
back
eyes
wide
open
hand
raised
in
spite
of
himself
conan
followed
his
gaze
and
so
did
the
women
the
girl
cowering
by
the
trembling
stallion
and
the
girl
beside
khemsa
down
the
mountain
slopes
like
a
whirl
of
shining
dust
blown
before
the
wind
a
crimson
conoid
cloud
came
dancing
khemsa
dark
face
turned
ashen
his
hand
began
to
tremble
then
sank
to
his
side
the
girl
beside
him
sensing
the
change
in
him
stared
at
him
inquiringly
the
crimson
shape
left
the
mountain
slope
and
came
down
in
a
long
arching
sweep
it
struck
the
ledge
between
conan
and
khemsa
and
the
rakhsha
gave
back
with
a
stifled
cry
he
backed
away
pushing
the
girl
gitara
back
with
groping
fending
hands
the
crimson
cloud
balanced
like
a
spinning
top
for
an
instant
whirling
in
a
dazzling
sheen
on
its
point
then
without
warning
it
was
gone
vanished
as
a
bubble
vanishes
when
burst
there
on
the
ledge
stood
four
men
it
was
miraculous
incredible
impossible
yet
it
was
true
they
were
not
ghosts
or
phantoms
they
were
four
tall
men
with
shaven
heads
and
black
robes
that
hid
their
feet
their
hands
were
concealed
by
their
wide
sleeves
they
stood
in
silence
their
naked
heads
nodding
slightly
in
unison
they
were
facing
khemsa
but
behind
them
conan
felt
his
own
blood
turning
to
ice
in
his
veins
rising
he
backed
stealthily
away
until
he
could
feel
the
stallion
shoulder
trembling
against
his
back
and
the
devi
crept
into
the
shelter
of
his
arm
there
was
no
word
spoken
silence
hung
like
a
stifling
pall
all
four
of
the
men
in
black
robes
stared
at
khemsa
their
faces
were
immobile
their
eyes
introspective
and
contemplative
but
khemsa
shook
like
a
man
in
an
ague
his
feet
were
braced
on
the
rock
his
calves
straining
as
if
in
physical
combat
sweat
ran
in
streams
down
his
dark
face
his
right
hand
locked
on
something
under
his
brown
robe
so
desperately
that
the
blood
ebbed
from
that
hand
and
left
it
white
his
left
hand
fell
on
the
shoulder
of
gitara
and
clutched
in
agony
like
the
grasp
of
a
drowning
man
she
did
not
flinch
or
whimper
though
his
fingers
dug
like
talons
into
her
firm
flesh
conan
had
witnessed
hundreds
of
battles
in
his
wild
life
but
never
one
like
this
wherein
four
diabolical
wills
sought
to
beat
down
one
lesser
but
equally
devilish
will
that
opposed
them
but
he
only
faintly
sensed
the
monstrous
quality
of
that
hideous
struggle
with
his
back
to
the
wall
driven
to
bay
by
his
former
masters
khemsa
was
fighting
for
his
life
with
all
the
dark
power
all
the
frightful
knowledge
they
had
taught
him
through
long
grim
years
of
neophytism
and
vassalage
he
was
stronger
than
even
he
had
guessed
and
the
free
exercise
of
his
powers
in
his
own
behalf
had
tapped
unsuspected
reservoirs
of
forces
and
he
was
nerved
to
by
frantic
fear
and
desperation
he
reeled
before
the
merciless
impact
of
those
hypnotic
eyes
but
he
held
his
ground
his
features
were
distorted
into
a
bestial
grin
of
agony
and
his
limbs
were
twisted
as
on
a
rack
it
was
a
war
of
souls
of
frightful
brains
steeped
in
lore
forbidden
to
men
for
a
million
years
of
mentalities
which
had
plumbed
the
abysses
and
explored
the
dark
stars
where
spawn
the
shadows
yasmina
understood
this
better
than
did
conan
and
she
dimly
understood
why
khemsa
could
withstand
the
concentrated
impact
of
those
four
hellish
wills
which
might
have
blasted
into
atoms
the
very
rock
on
which
he
stood
the
reason
was
the
girl
that
he
clutched
with
the
strength
of
his
despair
she
was
like
an
anchor
to
his
staggering
soul
battered
by
the
waves
of
those
psychic
emanations
his
weakness
was
now
his
strength
his
love
for
the
girl
violent
and
evil
though
it
might
be
was
yet
a
tie
that
bound
him
to
the
rest
of
humanity
providing
an
earthly
leverage
for
his
will
a
chain
that
his
inhuman
enemies
could
not
break
at
least
not
break
through
khemsa
they
realized
that
before
he
did
and
one
of
them
turned
his
gaze
from
the
rakhsha
full
upon
gitara
there
was
no
battle
there
the
girl
shrank
and
wilted
like
a
leaf
in
the
drought
irresistibly
impelled
she
tore
herself
from
her
lover
arms
before
he
realized
what
was
happening
then
a
hideous
thing
came
to
pass
she
began
to
back
toward
the
precipice
facing
her
tormentors
her
eyes
wide
and
blank
as
dark
gleaming
glass
from
behind
which
a
lamp
has
been
blown
out
khemsa
groaned
and
staggered
toward
her
falling
into
the
trap
set
for
him
a
divided
mind
could
not
maintain
the
unequal
battle
he
was
beaten
a
straw
in
their
hands
the
girl
went
backward
walking
like
an
automaton
and
khemsa
reeled
drunkenly
after
her
hands
vainly
outstretched
groaning
slobbering
in
his
pain
his
feet
moving
heavily
like
dead
things
on
the
very
brink
she
paused
standing
stiffly
her
heels
on
the
edge
and
he
fell
on
his
knees
and
crawled
whimpering
toward
her
groping
for
her
to
drag
her
back
from
destruction
and
just
before
his
clumsy
fingers
touched
her
one
of
the
wizards
laughed
like
the
sudden
bronze
note
of
a
bell
in
hell
the
girl
reeled
suddenly
and
consummate
climax
of
exquisite
cruelty
reason
and
understanding
flooded
back
into
her
eyes
which
flared
with
awful
fear
she
screamed
clutched
wildly
at
her
lover
straining
hand
and
then
unable
to
save
herself
fell
headlong
with
a
moaning
cry
khemsa
hauled
himself
to
the
edge
and
stared
over
haggardly
his
lips
working
as
he
mumbled
to
himself
then
he
turned
and
stared
for
a
long
minute
at
his
torturers
with
wide
eyes
that
held
no
human
light
and
then
with
a
cry
that
almost
burst
the
rocks
he
reeled
up
and
came
rushing
toward
them
a
knife
lifted
in
his
hand
one
of
the
rakhshas
stepped
forward
and
stamped
his
foot
and
as
he
stamped
there
came
a
rumbling
that
grew
swiftly
to
a
grinding
roar
where
his
foot
struck
a
crevice
opened
in
the
solid
rock
that
widened
instantly
then
with
a
deafening
crash
a
whole
section
of
the
ledge
gave
way
there
was
a
last
glimpse
of
khemsa
with
arms
wildly
upflung
and
then
he
vanished
amidst
the
roar
of
the
avalanche
that
thundered
down
into
the
abyss
the
four
looked
contemplatively
at
the
ragged
edge
of
rock
that
formed
the
new
rim
of
the
precipice
and
then
turned
suddenly
conan
thrown
off
his
feet
by
the
shudder
of
the
mountain
was
rising
lifting
yasmina
he
seemed
to
move
as
slowly
as
his
brain
was
working
he
was
befogged
and
stupid
he
realized
that
there
was
a
desperate
need
for
him
to
lift
the
devi
on
the
black
stallion
and
ride
like
the
wind
but
an
unaccountable
sluggishness
weighted
his
every
thought
and
action
and
now
the
wizards
had
turned
toward
him
they
raised
their
arms
and
to
his
horrified
sight
he
saw
their
outlines
fading
dimming
becoming
hazy
and
nebulous
as
a
crimson
smoke
billowed
around
their
feet
and
rose
about
them
they
were
blotted
out
by
a
sudden
whirling
cloud
and
then
he
realized
that
he
too
was
enveloped
in
a
blinding
crimson
mist
he
heard
yasmina
scream
and
the
stallion
cried
out
like
a
woman
in
pain
the
devi
was
torn
from
his
arm
and
as
he
lashed
out
with
his
knife
blindly
a
terrific
blow
like
a
gust
of
storm
wind
knocked
him
sprawling
against
a
rock
dazedly
he
saw
a
crimson
conoid
cloud
spinning
up
and
over
the
mountain
slopes
yasmina
was
gone
and
so
were
the
four
men
in
black
only
the
terrified
stallion
shared
the
ledge
with
him
on
to
yimsha
as
mists
vanish
before
a
strong
wind
the
cobwebs
vanished
from
brain
with
a
searing
curse
he
leaped
into
the
saddle
and
the
stallion
reared
neighing
beneath
him
he
glared
up
the
slopes
hesitated
and
then
turned
down
the
trail
in
the
direction
he
had
been
going
when
halted
by
khemsa
trickery
but
now
he
did
not
ride
at
a
measured
gait
he
shook
loose
the
reins
and
the
stallion
went
like
a
thunderbolt
as
if
frantic
to
lose
hysteria
in
violent
physical
exertion
across
the
ledge
and
around
the
crag
and
down
the
narrow
trail
threading
the
great
steep
they
plunged
at
breakneck
speed
the
path
followed
a
fold
of
rock
winding
interminably
down
from
tier
to
tier
of
striated
escarpment
and
once
far
below
conan
got
a
glimpse
of
the
ruin
that
had
fallen
a
mighty
pile
of
broken
stone
and
boulders
at
the
foot
of
a
gigantic
cliff
the
valley
floor
was
still
far
below
him
when
he
reached
a
long
and
lofty
ridge
that
led
out
from
the
slope
like
a
natural
causeway
out
upon
this
he
rode
with
an
almost
sheer
drop
on
either
hand
he
could
trace
ahead
of
him
the
trail
and
made
a
great
horseshoe
back
into
the
at
his
left
hand
he
cursed
the
necessity
of
traversing
those
miles
but
it
was
the
only
way
to
try
to
descend
to
the
lower
lap
of
the
trail
here
would
be
to
attempt
the
impossible
only
a
bird
could
get
to
the
with
a
whole
neck
so
he
urged
on
the
wearying
stallion
until
a
clink
of
hoofs
reached
his
ears
welling
up
from
below
pulling
up
short
and
reining
to
the
lip
of
the
cliff
he
stared
down
into
the
dry
that
wound
along
the
foot
of
the
ridge
along
that
gorge
rode
a
motley
throng
bearded
men
on
horses
five
hundred
strong
bristling
with
weapons
and
conan
shouted
suddenly
leaning
over
the
edge
of
the
cliff
three
hundred
feet
above
them
at
his
shout
they
reined
back
and
five
hundred
bearded
faces
were
tilted
up
towards
him
a
deep
clamorous
roar
filled
the
canyon
conan
did
not
waste
words
was
riding
for
ghor
he
roared
had
not
hoped
to
meet
you
dogs
on
the
trail
follow
me
as
fast
as
your
nags
can
push
i
going
to
yimsha
and
the
howl
was
like
a
dash
of
in
his
face
he
glared
down
at
them
jolted
speechless
he
saw
wild
eyes
blazing
up
at
him
faces
contorted
with
fury
fists
brandishing
blades
they
roared
back
wholeheartedly
are
the
seven
chiefs
held
captive
in
peshkhauri
in
the
governor
prison
i
suppose
he
answered
a
bloodthirsty
yell
from
a
hundred
throats
answered
him
with
such
a
waving
of
weapons
and
a
clamor
that
he
could
not
understand
what
they
were
saying
he
beat
down
the
din
with
a
roar
and
bellowed
devil
play
is
this
let
one
of
you
speak
so
i
can
understand
what
you
mean
a
gaunt
old
chief
elected
himself
to
this
position
shook
his
tulwar
at
conan
as
a
preamble
and
shouted
accusingly
would
not
let
us
go
raiding
peshkhauri
to
rescue
our
brothers
you
fools
roared
the
exasperated
cimmerian
if
breached
the
wall
which
is
unlikely
they
have
hanged
the
prisoners
before
you
could
reach
them
you
went
alone
to
traffic
with
the
governor
yelled
the
afghuli
working
himself
into
a
frothing
frenzy
are
the
seven
chiefs
howled
the
old
chief
making
his
tulwar
into
a
glimmering
wheel
of
steel
about
his
head
are
they
dead
conan
nearly
fell
off
his
horse
in
his
surprize
dead
five
hundred
bloodthirsty
voices
assured
him
the
old
chief
brandished
his
arms
and
got
the
floor
again
were
not
hanged
he
screeched
wazuli
in
another
cell
saw
them
die
the
governor
sent
a
wizard
to
slay
them
by
craft
must
be
a
lie
said
conan
governor
would
not
dare
last
night
i
talked
with
him
the
admission
was
unfortunate
a
yell
of
hate
and
accusation
split
the
skies
you
went
to
him
alone
to
betray
us
it
is
no
lie
the
wazuli
escaped
through
the
doors
the
wizard
burst
in
his
entry
and
told
the
tale
to
our
scouts
whom
he
met
in
zhaibar
they
had
been
sent
forth
to
search
for
you
when
you
did
not
return
when
they
heard
the
tale
they
returned
with
all
haste
to
ghor
and
we
saddled
our
steeds
and
girt
our
swords
what
do
you
fools
mean
to
do
demanded
the
cimmerian
avenge
our
brothers
they
howled
to
the
kshatriyas
slay
him
brothers
he
is
a
traitor
arrows
began
to
rattle
around
him
conan
rose
in
his
stirrups
striving
to
make
himself
heard
above
the
tumult
and
then
with
a
roar
of
mingled
rage
defiance
and
disgust
he
wheeled
and
galloped
back
up
the
trail
behind
him
and
below
him
the
afghulis
came
pelting
mouthing
their
rage
too
furious
even
to
remember
that
the
only
way
they
could
reach
the
height
whereon
he
rode
was
to
traverse
the
in
the
other
direction
make
the
broad
bend
and
follow
the
twisting
trail
up
over
the
ridge
when
they
did
remember
this
and
turned
back
their
repudiated
chief
had
almost
reached
the
point
where
the
ridge
joined
the
escarpment
at
the
cliff
he
did
not
take
the
trail
by
which
he
had
descended
but
turned
off
on
another
a
mere
trace
along
a
where
the
stallion
scrambled
for
footing
he
had
not
ridden
far
when
the
stallion
snorted
and
shied
back
from
something
lying
in
the
trail
conan
stared
down
on
the
travesty
of
a
man
a
broken
shredded
bloody
heap
that
gibbered
and
gnashed
splintered
teeth
impelled
by
some
obscure
reason
conan
dismounted
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
ghastly
shape
knowing
that
he
was
witness
of
a
thing
miraculous
and
opposed
to
nature
the
rakhsha
lifted
his
gory
head
and
his
strange
eyes
glazed
with
agony
and
approaching
death
rested
on
conan
with
recognition
are
they
it
was
a
racking
croak
not
even
remotely
resembling
a
human
voice
back
to
their
damnable
castle
on
yimsha
grunted
conan
took
the
devi
with
them
will
go
muttered
the
man
will
follow
them
they
killed
gitara
i
will
kill
them
the
acolytes
the
four
of
the
black
circle
the
master
himself
kill
kill
them
all
he
strove
to
drag
his
mutilated
frame
along
the
rock
but
not
even
his
indomitable
will
could
animate
that
gory
mass
longer
where
the
splintered
bones
hung
together
only
by
torn
tissue
and
ruptured
fibre
them
raved
khemsa
drooling
a
bloody
slaver
going
to
growled
conan
went
to
fetch
my
afghulis
but
turned
on
me
i
going
on
to
yimsha
alone
i
have
the
devi
back
if
i
have
to
tear
down
that
damned
mountain
with
my
bare
hands
i
think
the
governor
would
dare
kill
my
headmen
when
i
had
the
devi
but
it
seems
he
did
i
have
his
head
for
that
she
no
use
to
me
now
as
a
hostage
but
curse
of
yizil
on
them
gasped
khemsa
i
am
dying
wait
take
my
girdle
he
tried
to
fumble
with
a
mangled
hand
at
his
tatters
and
conan
understanding
what
he
sought
to
convey
bent
and
drew
from
about
his
gory
waist
a
girdle
of
curious
aspect
the
golden
vein
through
the
abyss
muttered
khemsa
the
girdle
i
had
it
from
a
stygian
priest
it
will
aid
you
though
it
failed
me
at
last
break
the
crystal
globe
with
the
four
golden
pomegranates
beware
of
the
master
transmutations
i
am
going
to
gitara
she
is
waiting
for
me
in
hell
ya
skelos
yar
and
so
he
died
conan
stared
down
at
the
girdle
the
hair
of
which
it
was
woven
was
not
horsehair
he
was
convinced
that
it
was
woven
of
the
thick
black
tresses
of
a
woman
set
in
the
thick
mesh
were
tiny
jewels
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
the
buckle
was
strangely
made
in
the
form
of
a
golden
flat
and
scaled
with
curious
art
a
strong
shudder
shook
conan
as
he
handled
it
and
he
turned
as
though
to
cast
it
over
the
precipice
then
he
hesitated
and
finally
buckled
it
about
his
waist
under
the
bakhariot
girdle
then
he
mounted
and
pushed
on
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
the
crags
he
climbed
the
trail
in
the
vast
shadow
of
the
cliffs
that
was
thrown
out
like
a
dark
blue
mantle
over
valleys
and
ridges
far
below
he
was
not
far
from
the
crest
when
edging
around
the
shoulder
of
a
jutting
crag
he
heard
the
clink
of
shod
hoofs
ahead
of
him
he
did
not
turn
back
indeed
so
narrow
was
the
path
that
the
stallion
could
not
have
wheeled
his
great
body
upon
it
he
rounded
the
jut
of
the
rock
and
came
upon
a
portion
of
the
path
that
broadened
somewhat
a
chorus
of
threatening
yells
broke
on
his
ear
but
his
stallion
pinned
a
terrified
horse
hard
against
the
rock
and
conan
caught
the
arm
of
the
rider
in
an
iron
grip
checking
the
lifted
sword
in
midair
shah
muttered
conan
red
glints
smoldering
luridly
in
his
eyes
the
turanian
did
not
struggle
they
sat
their
horses
almost
breast
to
breast
conan
fingers
locking
the
other
behind
kerim
shah
filed
a
group
of
lean
irakzai
on
gaunt
horses
they
glared
like
wolves
fingering
bows
and
knives
but
rendered
uncertain
because
of
the
narrowness
of
the
path
and
the
perilous
proximity
of
the
abyss
that
yawned
beneath
them
is
the
devi
demanded
kerim
shah
it
to
you
you
hyrkanian
spy
snarled
conan
know
you
have
her
answered
kerim
shah
was
on
my
way
northward
with
some
tribesmen
when
we
were
ambushed
by
enemies
in
shalizah
pass
many
of
my
men
were
slain
and
the
rest
of
us
harried
through
the
hills
like
jackals
when
we
had
beaten
off
our
pursuers
we
turned
westward
toward
amir
jehun
pass
and
this
morning
we
came
upon
a
wazuli
wandering
through
the
hills
he
was
quite
mad
but
i
learned
much
from
his
incoherent
gibberings
before
he
died
i
learned
that
he
was
the
sole
survivor
of
a
band
which
followed
a
chief
of
the
afghulis
and
a
captive
kshatriya
woman
into
a
gorge
behind
khurum
village
he
babbled
much
of
a
man
in
a
green
turban
whom
the
afghuli
rode
down
but
who
when
attacked
by
the
wazulis
who
pursued
smote
them
with
a
nameless
doom
that
wiped
them
out
as
a
gust
of
fire
wipes
out
a
cluster
of
locusts
that
one
man
escaped
i
do
not
know
nor
did
he
but
i
knew
from
his
maunderings
that
conan
of
ghor
had
been
in
khurum
with
his
royal
captive
and
as
we
made
our
way
through
the
hills
we
overtook
a
naked
galzai
girl
bearing
a
gourd
of
water
who
told
us
a
tale
of
having
been
stripped
and
ravished
by
a
giant
foreigner
in
the
garb
of
an
afghuli
chief
who
she
said
gave
her
garments
to
a
vendhyan
woman
who
accompanied
him
she
said
you
rode
westward
kerim
shah
did
not
consider
it
necessary
to
explain
that
he
had
been
on
his
way
to
keep
his
rendezvous
with
the
expected
troops
from
secunderam
when
he
found
his
way
barred
by
hostile
tribesmen
the
road
to
gurashah
valley
through
shalizah
pass
was
longer
than
the
road
that
wound
through
amir
jehun
pass
but
the
latter
traversed
part
of
the
afghuli
country
which
kerim
shah
had
been
anxious
to
avoid
until
he
came
with
an
army
barred
from
the
shalizah
road
however
he
had
turned
to
the
forbidden
route
until
news
that
conan
had
not
yet
reached
afghulistan
with
his
captive
had
caused
him
to
turn
southward
and
push
on
recklessly
in
the
hope
of
overtaking
the
cimmerian
in
the
hills
you
had
better
tell
me
where
the
devi
is
suggested
kerim
shah
outnumber
you
one
of
your
dogs
nock
a
shaft
and
i
throw
you
over
the
cliff
conan
promised
would
do
you
any
good
to
kill
me
anyhow
five
hundred
afghulis
are
on
my
trail
and
if
they
find
you
cheated
them
they
flay
you
alive
anyway
i
have
got
the
devi
she
in
the
hands
of
the
black
seers
of
yimsha
swore
kerim
shah
softly
shaken
out
of
his
poise
for
the
first
time
dead
grunted
conan
masters
sent
him
to
hell
on
a
landslide
and
now
get
out
of
my
way
i
be
glad
to
kill
you
if
i
had
the
time
but
i
on
my
way
to
yimsha
go
with
you
said
the
turanian
abruptly
conan
laughed
at
him
you
think
i
trust
you
you
hyrkanian
dog
do
ask
you
to
returned
kerim
shah
both
want
the
devi
you
know
my
reason
king
yezdigerd
desires
to
add
her
kingdom
to
his
empire
and
herself
in
his
seraglio
and
i
knew
you
in
the
days
when
you
were
a
hetman
of
the
steppes
so
i
know
your
ambition
is
wholesale
plunder
you
want
to
loot
vendhya
and
to
twist
out
a
huge
ransom
for
yasmina
well
let
us
for
the
time
being
without
any
illusion
about
each
other
unite
our
forces
and
try
to
rescue
the
devi
from
the
seers
if
we
succeed
and
live
we
can
fight
it
out
to
see
who
keeps
her
conan
narrowly
scrutinized
the
other
for
a
moment
and
then
nodded
releasing
the
turanian
arm
what
about
your
men
kerim
shah
turned
to
the
silent
irakzai
and
spoke
briefly
chief
and
i
are
going
to
yimsha
to
fight
the
wizards
will
you
go
with
us
or
stay
here
to
be
flayed
by
the
afghulis
who
are
following
this
man
they
looked
at
him
with
eyes
grimly
fatalistic
they
were
doomed
and
they
knew
it
had
known
it
ever
since
the
singing
arrows
of
the
ambushed
dagozai
had
driven
them
back
from
the
pass
of
shalizah
the
men
of
the
lower
zhaibar
had
too
many
reeking
bloodfeuds
among
the
they
were
too
small
a
band
to
fight
their
way
back
through
the
hills
to
the
villages
of
the
border
without
the
guidance
of
the
crafty
turanian
they
counted
themselves
as
dead
already
so
they
made
the
reply
that
only
dead
men
would
make
will
go
with
thee
and
die
on
yimsha
in
crom
name
let
us
be
gone
grunted
conan
fidgeting
with
impatience
as
he
started
into
the
blue
gulfs
of
the
deepening
twilight
wolves
were
hours
behind
me
but
we
lost
a
devilish
lot
of
time
kerim
shah
backed
his
steed
from
between
the
black
stallion
and
the
cliff
sheathed
his
sword
and
cautiously
turned
the
horse
presently
the
band
was
filing
up
the
path
as
swiftly
as
they
dared
they
came
out
upon
the
crest
nearly
a
mile
east
of
the
spot
where
khemsa
had
halted
the
cimmerian
and
the
devi
the
path
they
had
traversed
was
a
perilous
one
even
for
and
for
that
reason
conan
had
avoided
it
that
day
when
carrying
yasmina
though
kerim
shah
following
him
had
taken
it
supposing
the
cimmerian
had
done
likewise
even
conan
sighed
with
relief
when
the
horses
scrambled
up
over
the
last
rim
they
moved
like
phantom
riders
through
an
enchanted
realm
of
shadows
the
soft
creak
of
leather
the
clink
of
steel
marked
their
passing
then
again
the
dark
mountain
slopes
lay
naked
and
silent
in
the
starlight
yasmina
knows
stark
terror
yasmina
had
time
but
for
one
scream
when
she
felt
herself
enveloped
in
that
crimson
whirl
and
torn
from
her
protector
with
appalling
force
she
screamed
once
and
then
she
had
no
breath
to
scream
she
was
blinded
deafened
rendered
mute
and
eventually
senseless
by
the
terrific
rushing
of
the
air
about
her
there
was
a
dazed
consciousness
of
dizzy
height
and
numbing
speed
a
confused
impression
of
natural
sensations
gone
mad
and
then
vertigo
and
oblivion
a
vestige
of
these
sensations
clung
to
her
as
she
recovered
consciousness
so
she
cried
out
and
clutched
wildly
as
though
to
stay
a
headlong
and
involuntary
flight
her
fingers
closed
on
soft
fabric
and
a
relieving
sense
of
stability
pervaded
her
she
took
cognizance
of
her
surroundings
she
was
lying
on
a
dais
covered
with
black
velvet
this
dais
stood
in
a
great
dim
room
whose
walls
were
hung
with
dusky
tapestries
across
which
crawled
dragons
reproduced
with
repellent
realism
floating
shadows
merely
hinted
at
the
lofty
ceiling
and
gloom
that
lent
itself
to
illusion
lurked
in
the
corners
there
seemed
to
be
neither
windows
nor
doors
in
the
walls
or
else
they
were
concealed
by
the
nighted
tapestries
where
the
dim
light
came
from
yasmina
could
not
determine
the
great
room
was
a
realm
of
mysteries
or
shadows
and
shadowy
shapes
in
which
she
could
not
have
sworn
to
observe
movement
yet
which
invaded
her
mind
with
a
dim
and
formless
terror
but
her
gaze
fixed
itself
on
a
tangible
object
on
another
smaller
dais
of
jet
a
few
feet
away
a
man
sat
gazing
contemplatively
at
her
his
long
black
velvet
robe
embroidered
with
gold
thread
fell
loosely
about
him
masking
his
figure
his
hands
were
folded
in
his
sleeves
there
was
a
velvet
cap
upon
his
head
his
face
was
calm
placid
not
unhandsome
his
eyes
lambent
and
slightly
oblique
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
as
he
sat
regarding
her
nor
did
his
expression
alter
when
he
saw
she
was
conscious
yasmina
felt
fear
crawl
like
a
trickle
of
down
her
supple
spine
she
lifted
herself
on
her
elbows
and
stared
apprehensively
at
the
stranger
are
you
she
demanded
her
voice
sounded
brittle
and
inadequate
am
the
master
of
yimsha
the
tone
was
rich
and
resonant
like
the
mellow
tones
of
a
temple
bell
did
you
bring
me
here
she
demanded
you
not
seeking
me
you
are
one
of
the
black
seers
yes
she
answered
recklessly
believing
that
he
could
read
her
thoughts
anyway
he
laughed
softly
and
chills
crawled
up
and
down
her
spine
again
would
turn
the
wild
children
of
the
hills
against
the
seers
of
yimsha
he
smiled
have
read
it
in
your
mind
princess
your
weak
human
mind
filled
with
petty
dreams
of
hate
and
revenge
slew
my
brother
a
rising
tide
of
anger
was
vying
with
her
fear
her
hands
were
clenched
her
lithe
body
rigid
did
you
persecute
him
he
never
harmed
you
the
priests
say
the
seers
are
above
meddling
in
human
affairs
why
did
you
destroy
the
king
of
vendhya
can
an
ordinary
human
understand
the
motives
of
a
seer
returned
the
master
calmly
acolytes
in
the
temples
of
turan
who
are
the
priests
behind
the
priests
of
tarim
urged
me
to
bestir
myself
in
behalf
of
yezdigerd
for
reasons
of
my
own
i
complied
how
can
i
explain
my
mystic
reasons
to
your
puny
intellect
you
could
not
understand
understand
this
that
my
brother
died
tears
of
grief
and
rage
shook
in
her
voice
she
rose
upon
her
knees
and
stared
at
him
with
wide
blazing
eyes
as
supple
and
dangerous
in
that
moment
as
a
yezdigerd
desired
agreed
the
master
calmly
a
while
it
was
my
whim
to
further
his
ambitions
yezdigerd
your
vassal
yasmina
tried
to
keep
the
timbre
of
her
voice
unaltered
she
had
felt
her
knee
pressing
something
hard
and
symmetrical
under
a
fold
of
velvet
subtly
she
shifted
her
position
moving
her
hand
under
the
fold
the
dog
that
licks
up
the
offal
in
the
temple
yard
the
vassal
of
the
god
returned
the
master
he
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
actions
she
sought
to
dissemble
concealed
by
the
velvet
her
fingers
closed
on
what
she
knew
was
the
golden
hilt
of
a
dagger
she
bent
her
head
to
hide
the
light
of
triumph
in
her
eyes
am
weary
of
yezdigerd
said
the
master
have
turned
to
other
amusements
ha
with
a
fierce
cry
yasmina
sprang
like
a
jungle
cat
stabbing
murderously
then
she
stumbled
and
slid
to
the
floor
where
she
cowered
staring
up
at
the
man
on
the
dais
he
had
not
moved
his
cryptic
smile
was
unchanged
tremblingly
she
lifted
her
hand
and
stared
at
it
with
dilated
eyes
there
was
no
dagger
in
her
fingers
they
grasped
a
stalk
of
golden
lotus
the
crushed
blossoms
drooping
on
the
bruised
stem
she
dropped
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
viper
and
scrambled
away
from
the
proximity
of
her
tormenter
she
returned
to
her
own
dais
because
that
was
at
least
more
dignified
for
a
queen
than
groveling
on
the
floor
at
the
feet
of
a
sorcerer
and
eyed
him
apprehensively
expecting
reprisals
but
the
master
made
no
move
substance
is
one
to
him
who
holds
the
key
of
the
cosmos
he
said
cryptically
an
adept
nothing
is
immutable
at
will
steel
blossoms
bloom
in
unnamed
gardens
or
flash
in
the
moonlight
are
a
devil
she
sobbed
i
he
laughed
was
born
on
this
planet
long
ago
once
i
was
a
common
man
nor
have
i
lost
all
human
attributes
in
the
numberless
eons
of
my
adeptship
a
human
steeped
in
the
dark
arts
is
greater
than
a
devil
i
am
of
human
origin
but
i
rule
demons
you
have
seen
the
lords
of
the
black
circle
it
would
blast
your
soul
to
hear
from
what
far
realm
i
summoned
them
and
from
what
doom
i
guard
them
with
ensorcelled
crystal
and
golden
serpents
only
i
can
rule
them
my
foolish
khemsa
thought
to
make
himself
great
poor
fool
bursting
material
doors
and
hurtling
himself
and
his
mistress
through
the
air
from
hill
to
hill
yet
if
he
had
not
been
destroyed
his
power
might
have
grown
to
rival
mine
he
laughed
again
you
poor
silly
thing
plotting
to
send
a
hairy
hill
chief
to
storm
yimsha
it
was
such
a
jest
that
i
myself
could
have
designed
had
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
should
fall
in
his
hands
and
i
read
in
your
childish
mind
an
intention
to
seduce
by
your
feminine
wiles
to
attempt
your
purpose
anyway
for
all
your
stupidity
you
are
a
woman
fair
to
look
upon
it
is
my
whim
to
keep
you
for
my
slave
the
daughter
of
a
thousand
proud
emperors
gasped
with
shame
and
fury
at
the
word
dare
not
his
mocking
laughter
cut
her
like
a
whip
across
her
naked
shoulders
king
dares
not
trample
a
worm
in
the
road
little
fool
do
you
not
realize
that
your
royal
pride
is
no
more
than
a
straw
blown
on
the
wind
i
who
have
known
the
kisses
of
the
queens
of
hell
you
have
seen
how
i
deal
with
a
rebel
cowed
and
awed
the
girl
crouched
on
the
dais
the
light
grew
dimmer
and
more
the
features
of
the
master
became
shadowy
his
voice
took
on
a
newer
tone
of
command
will
never
yield
to
you
her
voice
trembled
with
fear
but
it
carried
a
ring
of
resolution
will
yield
he
answered
with
horrible
conviction
and
pain
shall
teach
you
i
will
lash
you
with
horror
and
agony
to
the
last
quivering
ounce
of
your
endurance
until
you
become
as
melted
wax
to
be
bent
and
molded
in
my
hands
as
i
desire
you
shall
know
such
discipline
as
no
mortal
woman
ever
knew
until
my
slightest
command
is
to
you
as
the
unalterable
will
of
the
gods
and
first
to
humble
your
pride
you
shall
travel
back
through
the
lost
ages
and
view
all
the
shapes
that
have
been
you
yil
la
khosa
at
these
words
the
shadowy
room
swam
before
yasmina
affrighted
gaze
the
roots
of
her
hair
prickled
her
scalp
and
her
tongue
clove
to
her
palate
somewhere
a
gong
sounded
a
deep
ominous
note
the
dragons
on
the
tapestries
glowed
like
blue
fire
and
then
faded
out
the
master
on
his
dais
was
but
a
shapeless
shadow
the
dim
light
gave
way
to
soft
thick
darkness
almost
tangible
that
pulsed
with
strange
radiations
she
could
no
longer
see
the
master
she
could
see
nothing
she
had
a
strange
sensation
that
the
walls
and
ceiling
had
withdrawn
immensely
from
her
then
somewhere
in
the
darkness
a
glow
began
like
a
firefly
that
rhythmically
dimmed
and
quickened
it
grew
to
a
golden
ball
and
as
it
expanded
its
light
grew
more
intense
flaming
whitely
it
burst
suddenly
showering
the
darkness
with
white
sparks
that
did
not
illumine
the
shadows
but
like
an
impression
left
in
the
gloom
a
faint
luminance
remained
and
revealed
a
slender
dusky
shaft
shooting
up
from
the
shadowy
floor
under
the
girl
dilated
gaze
it
spread
took
shape
stems
and
broad
leaves
appeared
and
great
black
poisonous
blossoms
that
towered
above
her
as
she
cringed
against
the
velvet
a
subtle
perfume
pervaded
the
atmosphere
it
was
the
dread
figure
of
the
black
lotus
that
had
grown
up
as
she
watched
as
it
grows
in
the
haunted
forbidden
jungles
of
khitai
the
broad
leaves
were
murmurous
with
evil
life
the
blossoms
bent
toward
her
like
sentient
things
nodding
on
pliant
stems
etched
against
soft
impenetrable
darkness
it
loomed
over
her
gigantic
blackly
visible
in
some
mad
way
her
brain
reeled
with
the
drugging
scent
and
she
sought
to
crawl
from
the
dais
then
she
clung
to
it
as
it
seemed
to
be
pitching
at
an
impossible
slant
she
cried
out
with
terror
and
clung
to
the
velvet
but
she
felt
her
fingers
ruthlessly
torn
away
there
was
a
sensation
as
of
all
sanity
and
stability
crumbling
and
vanishing
she
was
a
quivering
atom
of
sentiency
driven
through
a
black
roaring
icy
void
by
a
thundering
wind
that
threatened
to
extinguish
her
feeble
flicker
of
animate
life
like
a
candle
blown
out
in
a
storm
then
there
came
a
period
of
blind
impulse
and
movement
when
the
atom
that
was
she
mingled
and
merged
with
myriad
other
atoms
of
spawning
life
in
the
yeasty
morass
of
existence
molded
by
formative
forces
until
she
emerged
again
a
conscious
individual
whirling
down
an
endless
spiral
of
lives
in
a
mist
of
terror
she
relived
all
her
former
existences
recognized
and
again
all
the
bodies
that
had
carried
her
ego
throughout
the
changing
ages
she
bruised
her
feet
again
over
the
long
weary
road
of
life
that
stretched
out
behind
her
into
the
immemorial
past
back
beyond
the
dimmest
dawns
of
time
she
crouched
shuddering
in
primordial
jungles
hunted
by
slavering
beasts
of
prey
she
waded
in
rice
swamps
battling
with
squawking
for
the
precious
grains
she
labored
with
the
oxen
to
drag
the
pointed
stick
through
the
stubborn
soil
and
she
crouched
endlessly
over
looms
in
peasant
huts
she
saw
walled
cities
burst
into
flame
and
fled
screaming
before
the
slayers
she
reeled
naked
and
bleeding
over
burning
sands
dragged
at
the
slaver
stirrup
and
she
knew
the
grip
of
hot
fierce
hands
on
her
writhing
flesh
the
shame
and
agony
of
brutal
lust
she
screamed
under
the
bite
of
the
lash
and
moaned
on
the
rack
mad
with
terror
she
fought
against
the
hands
that
forced
her
head
inexorably
down
on
the
bloody
block
she
knew
the
agonies
of
childbirth
and
the
bitterness
of
love
betrayed
she
suffered
all
the
woes
and
wrongs
and
brutalities
that
man
has
inflicted
on
woman
throughout
the
eons
and
she
endured
all
the
spite
and
malice
of
women
for
woman
and
like
the
flick
of
a
fiery
whip
throughout
was
the
consciousness
she
retained
of
her
she
was
all
the
women
she
had
ever
been
yet
in
her
knowing
she
was
yasmina
this
consciousness
was
not
lost
in
the
throes
of
reincarnation
at
one
and
the
same
time
she
was
a
naked
groveling
under
the
whip
and
the
proud
devi
of
vendhya
and
she
suffered
not
only
as
the
suffered
but
as
yasmina
to
whose
pride
the
whip
was
like
a
brand
life
merged
into
life
in
flying
chaos
each
with
its
burden
of
woe
and
shame
and
agony
until
she
dimly
heard
her
own
voice
screaming
unbearably
like
one
cry
of
suffering
echoing
down
the
ages
then
she
awakened
on
the
dais
in
the
mystic
room
in
a
ghostly
gray
light
she
saw
again
the
dais
and
the
cryptic
robed
figure
seated
upon
it
the
hooded
head
was
bent
the
high
shoulders
faintly
etched
against
the
uncertain
dimness
she
could
make
out
no
details
clearly
but
the
hood
where
the
velvet
cap
had
been
stirred
a
formless
uneasiness
in
her
as
she
stared
there
stole
over
her
a
nameless
fear
that
froze
her
tongue
to
her
palate
a
feeling
that
it
was
not
the
master
who
sat
so
silently
on
that
black
dais
then
the
figure
moved
and
rose
upright
towering
above
her
it
stooped
over
her
and
the
long
arms
in
their
wide
black
sleeves
bent
about
her
she
fought
against
them
in
speechless
fright
surprized
by
their
lean
hardness
the
hooded
head
bent
down
toward
her
averted
face
and
she
screamed
and
screamed
again
in
poignant
fear
and
loathing
bony
arms
gripped
her
lithe
body
and
from
that
hood
looked
forth
a
countenance
of
death
and
decay
features
like
rotting
parchment
on
a
moldering
skull
she
screamed
again
and
then
as
those
champing
grinning
jaws
bent
toward
her
lips
she
lost
consciousness
the
castle
of
the
wizards
the
sun
had
risen
over
the
white
himelian
peaks
at
the
foot
of
a
long
slope
a
group
of
horsemen
halted
and
stared
upward
high
above
them
a
stone
tower
poised
on
the
pitch
of
the
mountainside
beyond
and
above
that
gleamed
the
walls
of
a
greater
keep
near
the
line
where
the
snow
began
that
capped
yimsha
pinnacle
there
was
a
touch
of
unreality
about
the
whole
purple
slopes
pitching
up
to
that
fantastic
castle
with
distance
and
above
it
the
white
glistening
peak
shouldering
the
cold
blue
leave
the
horses

from
the

stallion
which
stood
with
legs
and
drooping
head
they
had
pushed
hard
throughout
the
night

at
scraps
from
and
pausing
only
to
give

already
far
up
yimsha
side
and
a
vast
expanse
of
lesser
peaks
and
crags
spread
out
beneath
them
among
these
labyrinths
the
turanian
sought
in
vain
for
a
movement
of
color
that
would
betray
men
evidently
the
pursuing
afghulis
had
lost
their
chiefs
trail
in
the
night
us
go
then
they
tied
the
weary
horses
in
a
clump
of
tamarisk
and
without
further
comment
turned
up
the
slope
there
was
no
cover
it
was
a
naked
incline
strewn
with
boulders
not
big
enough
to
conceal
a
man
but
they
did
conceal
something
else
the
party
had
not
gone
fifty
steps
when
a
snarling
shape
burst
from
behind
a
rock
it
was
one
of
the
gaunt
savage
dogs
that
infested
the
hill
villages
and
its
eyes
glared
redly
its
jaws
dripped
foam
conan
was
leading
but
it
did
not
attack
him
it
dashed
past
him
and
leaped
at
kerim
shah
the
turanian
leaped
aside
and
the
great
dog
flung
itself
upon
the
irakzai
behind
him
the
man
yelled
and
threw
up
his
arm
which
was
torn
by
the
brute
fangs
as
it
bore
him
backward
and
the
next
instant
half
a
dozen
tulwars
were
hacking
at
the
beast
yet
not
until
it
was
literally
dismembered
did
the
hideous
creature
cease
its
efforts
to
seize
and
rend
its
attackers
kerim
shah
bound
up
the
wounded
warrior
gashed
arm
looked
at
him
narrowly
and
then
turned
away
without
a
word
he
rejoined
conan
and
they
renewed
the
climb
in
silence
presently
kerim
shah
said
to
find
a
village
dog
in
this
place
no
offal
here
grunted
conan
both
turned
their
heads
to
glance
back
at
the
wounded
warrior
toiling
after
them
among
his
companions
sweat
glistened
on
his
dark
face
and
his
lips
were
drawn
back
from
his
teeth
in
a
grimace
of
pain
then
both
looked
again
at
the
stone
tower
squatting
above
them
a
slumberous
quiet
lay
over
the
uplands
the
tower
showed
no
sign
of
life
nor
did
the
strange
pyramidal
structure
beyond
it
but
the
men
who
toiled
upward
went
with
the
tenseness
of
men
walking
on
the
edge
of
a
crater
kerim
shah
had
unslung
the
powerful
turanian
bow
that
killed
at
five
hundred
paces
and
the
irakzai
looked
to
their
own
lighter
and
less
lethal
bows
but
they
were
not
within
of
the
tower
when
something
shot
down
out
of
the
sky
without
warning
it
passed
so
close
to
conan
that
he
felt
the
wind
of
rushing
wings
but
it
was
an
irakzai
who
staggered
and
fell
blood
jetting
from
a
severed
jugular
a
hawk
with
wings
like
burnished
steel
shot
up
again
blood
dripping
from
the
to
reel
against
the
sky
as
kerim
shah
bowstring
twanged
it
dropped
like
a
plummet
but
no
man
saw
where
it
struck
the
earth
conan
bent
over
the
victim
of
the
attack
but
the
man
was
already
dead
no
one
spoke
useless
to
comment
on
the
fact
that
never
before
had
a
hawk
been
known
to
swoop
on
a
man
red
rage
began
to
vie
with
fatalistic
lethargy
in
the
wild
souls
of
the
irakzai
hairy
fingers
nocked
arrows
and
men
glared
vengefully
at
the
tower
whose
very
silence
mocked
them
but
the
next
attack
came
swiftly
they
all
saw
it
a
white
puffball
of
smoke
that
tumbled
over
the
and
came
drifting
and
rolling
down
the
slope
toward
them
others
followed
it
they
seemed
harmless
mere
woolly
globes
of
cloudy
foam
but
conan
stepped
aside
to
avoid
contact
with
the
first
behind
him
one
of
the
irakzai
reached
out
and
thrust
his
sword
into
the
unstable
mass
instantly
a
sharp
report
shook
the
mountainside
there
was
a
burst
of
blinding
flame
and
then
the
puffball
had
vanished
and
the
warrior
remained
only
a
heap
of
charred
and
blackened
bones
the
crisped
hand
still
gripped
the
ivory
but
the
blade
was
gone
melted
and
destroyed
by
that
awful
heat
yet
men
standing
almost
within
reach
of
the
victim
had
not
suffered
except
to
be
dazzled
and
half
blinded
by
the
sudden
flare
touches
it
off
grunted
conan
out
here
they
come
the
slope
above
them
was
almost
covered
by
the
billowing
spheres
kerim
shah
bent
his
bow
and
sent
a
shaft
into
the
mass
and
those
touched
by
the
arrow
burst
like
bubbles
in
spurting
flame
his
men
followed
his
example
and
for
the
next
few
minutes
it
was
as
if
a
thunderstorm
raged
on
the
mountain
slope
with
bolts
of
lightning
striking
and
bursting
in
showers
of
flame
when
the
barrage
ceased
only
a
few
arrows
were
left
in
the
quivers
of
the
archers
they
pushed
on
grimly
over
soil
charred
and
blackened
where
the
naked
rock
had
in
places
been
turned
to
lava
by
the
explosion
of
those
diabolical
bombs
now
they
were
almost
within
of
the
silent
tower
and
they
spread
their
line
nerves
taut
ready
for
any
horror
that
might
descend
upon
them
on
the
tower
appeared
a
single
figure
lifting
a
bronze
horn
its
strident
bellow
roared
out
across
the
echoing
slopes
like
the
blare
of
trumpets
on
judgment
day
and
it
began
to
be
fearfully
answered
the
ground
trembled
under
the
feet
of
the
invaders
and
rumblings
and
grindings
welled
up
from
the
subterranean
depths
the
irakzai
screamed
reeling
like
drunken
men
on
the
shuddering
slope
and
conan
eyes
glaring
charged
recklessly
up
the
incline
knife
in
hand
straight
at
the
door
that
showed
in
the
above
him
the
great
horn
roared
and
bellowed
in
brutish
mockery
and
then
kerim
shah
drew
a
shaft
to
his
ear
and
loosed
only
a
turanian
could
have
made
that
shot
the
bellowing
of
the
horn
ceased
suddenly
and
a
high
thin
scream
shrilled
in
its
place
the
figure
on
the
tower
staggered
clutching
at
the
long
shaft
which
quivered
in
its
bosom
and
then
pitched
across
the
parapet
the
great
horn
tumbled
upon
the
battlement
and
hung
precariously
and
another
robed
figure
rushed
to
seize
it
shrieking
in
horror
again
the
turanian
bow
twanged
and
again
it
was
answered
by
a
the
second
acolyte
in
falling
struck
the
horn
with
his
elbow
and
knocked
it
clattering
over
the
parapet
to
shatter
on
the
rocks
far
below
at
such
headlong
speed
had
conan
covered
the
ground
that
before
the
clattering
echoes
of
that
fall
had
died
away
he
was
hacking
at
the
door
warned
by
his
savage
instinct
he
gave
back
suddenly
as
a
tide
of
molten
lead
splashed
down
from
above
but
the
next
instant
he
was
back
again
attacking
the
panels
with
redoubled
fury
he
was
galvanized
by
the
fact
that
his
enemies
had
resorted
to
earthly
weapons
the
sorcery
of
the
acolytes
was
limited
their
necromantic
resources
might
well
be
exhausted
kerim
shah
was
hurrying
up
the
slope
his
behind
him
in
a
straggling
crescent
they
loosed
as
they
ran
their
arrows
splintering
against
the
walls
or
arching
over
the
parapet
the
heavy
teak
portal
gave
way
beneath
the
cimmerian
assault
and
he
peered
inside
warily
expecting
anything
he
was
looking
into
a
circular
chamber
from
which
a
stair
wound
upward
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
chamber
a
door
gaped
open
revealing
the
outer
slope
and
the
backs
of
half
a
dozen
figures
in
full
retreat
conan
yelled
took
a
step
into
the
tower
and
then
native
caution
jerked
him
back
just
as
a
great
block
of
stone
fell
crashing
to
the
floor
where
his
foot
had
been
an
instant
before
shouting
to
his
followers
he
raced
around
the
tower
the
acolytes
had
evacuated
their
first
line
of
defence
as
conan
rounded
the
tower
he
saw
their
green
robes
twinkling
up
the
mountain
ahead
of
him
he
gave
chase
panting
with
earnest
and
behind
him
kerim
shah
and
the
irakzai
came
pelting
the
latter
yelling
like
wolves
at
the
flight
of
their
enemies
their
fatalism
momentarily
submerged
by
temporary
triumph
the
tower
stood
on
the
lower
edge
of
a
narrow
plateau
whose
upward
slant
was
barely
perceptible
a
few
hundred
yards
away
this
plateau
ended
abruptly
in
a
chasm
which
had
been
invisible
farther
down
the
mountain
into
this
chasm
the
acolytes
apparently
leaped
without
checking
their
speed
their
pursuers
saw
the
green
robes
flutter
and
disappear
over
the
edge
a
few
moments
later
they
themselves
were
standing
on
the
brink
of
the
mighty
moat
that
cut
them
off
from
the
castle
of
the
black
seers
it
was
a
ravine
that
extended
in
either
direction
as
far
as
they
could
see
apparently
girdling
the
mountain
some
four
hundred
yards
in
width
and
five
hundred
feet
deep
and
in
it
from
rim
to
rim
a
strange
translucent
mist
sparkled
and
shimmered
looking
down
conan
grunted
far
below
him
moving
across
the
glimmering
floor
which
shone
like
burnished
silver
he
saw
the
forms
of
the
acolytes
their
outline
was
wavering
and
indistinct
like
figures
seen
under
deep
water
they
walked
in
single
file
moving
toward
the
opposite
wall
kerim
shah
nocked
an
arrow
and
sent
it
singing
downward
but
when
it
struck
the
mist
that
filled
the
chasm
it
seemed
to
lose
momentum
and
direction
wandering
widely
from
its
course
they
went
down
so
can
we
grunted
conan
while
kerim
shah
stared
after
his
shaft
in
amazement
saw
them
last
at
this
spot
squinting
down
he
saw
something
shining
like
a
golden
thread
across
the
canyon
floor
far
below
the
acolytes
seemed
to
be
following
this
thread
and
there
suddenly
came
to
him
khemsa
cryptic
words
the
golden
vein
on
the
brink
under
his
very
hand
as
he
crouched
he
found
it
a
thin
vein
of
sparkling
gold
running
from
an
outcropping
of
ore
to
the
edge
and
down
across
the
silvery
floor
and
he
found
something
else
which
had
before
been
invisible
to
him
because
of
the
peculiar
refraction
of
the
light
the
gold
vein
followed
a
narrow
ramp
which
slanted
down
into
the
ravine
fitted
with
niches
for
hand
and
foot
hold
where
they
went
down
he
grunted
to
kerim
shah
no
adepts
to
waft
themselves
through
the
air
we
follow
them
it
was
at
that
instant
that
the
man
who
had
been
bitten
by
the
mad
dog
cried
out
horribly
and
leaped
at
kerim
shah
foaming
and
gnashing
his
teeth
the
turanian
quick
as
a
cat
on
his
feet
sprang
aside
and
the
madman
pitched
over
the
brink
the
others
rushed
to
the
edge
and
glared
after
him
in
amazement
the
maniac
did
not
fall
he
floated
slowly
down
through
the
rosy
haze
like
a
man
sinking
in
deep
water
his
limbs
moved
like
a
man
trying
to
swim
and
his
features
were
purple
and
convulsed
beyond
the
contortions
of
his
madness
far
down
at
last
on
the
shining
floor
his
body
settled
and
lay
still
death
in
that
chasm
muttered
kerim
shah
drawing
back
from
the
rosy
mist
that
shimmered
almost
at
his
feet
now
conan
answered
the
cimmerian
grimly
acolytes
are
human
if
the
mist
does
kill
them
it
wo
kill
me
he
hitched
his
belt
and
his
hands
touched
the
girdle
khemsa
had
given
him
he
scowled
then
smiled
bleakly
he
had
forgotten
that
girdle
yet
thrice
had
death
passed
him
by
to
strike
another
victim
the
acolytes
had
reached
the
farther
wall
and
were
moving
up
it
like
great
green
flies
letting
himself
upon
the
ramp
he
descended
warily
the
rosy
cloud
lapped
about
his
ankles
ascending
as
he
lowered
himself
it
reached
his
knees
his
thighs
his
waist
his
he
felt
as
one
feels
a
thick
heavy
fog
on
a
damp
night
with
it
lapping
about
his
chin
he
hesitated
and
then
ducked
under
instantly
his
breath
ceased
all
air
was
shut
off
from
him
and
he
felt
his
ribs
caving
in
on
his
vitals
with
a
frantic
effort
he
heaved
himself
up
fighting
for
life
his
head
rose
above
the
surface
and
he
drank
air
in
great
gulps
kerim
shah
leaned
down
toward
him
spoke
to
him
but
conan
neither
heard
nor
heeded
stubbornly
his
mind
fixed
on
what
the
dying
khemsa
had
told
him
the
cimmerian
groped
for
the
gold
vein
and
found
that
he
had
moved
off
it
in
his
descent
several
series
of
were
niched
in
the
ramp
placing
himself
directly
over
the
thread
he
began
climbing
down
once
more
the
rosy
mist
rose
about
him
engulfed
him
now
his
head
was
under
but
he
was
still
drinking
pure
air
above
him
he
saw
his
companions
staring
down
at
him
their
features
blurred
by
the
haze
that
shimmered
over
his
head
he
gestured
for
them
to
follow
and
went
down
swiftly
without
waiting
to
see
whether
they
complied
or
not
kerim
shah
sheathed
his
sword
without
comment
and
followed
and
the
irakzai
more
fearful
of
being
left
alone
than
of
the
terrors
that
might
lurk
below
scrambled
after
him
each
man
clung
to
the
golden
thread
as
they
saw
the
cimmerian
do
down
the
slanting
ramp
they
went
to
the
ravine
floor
and
moved
out
across
the
shining
level
treading
the
gold
vein
like
it
was
as
if
they
walked
along
an
invisible
tunnel
through
which
air
circulated
freely
they
felt
death
pressing
in
on
them
above
and
on
either
hand
but
it
did
not
touch
them
the
vein
crawled
up
a
similar
ramp
on
the
other
wall
up
which
the
acolytes
had
disappeared
and
up
it
they
went
with
taut
nerves
not
knowing
what
might
be
waiting
for
them
among
the
jutting
spurs
of
rock
that
fanged
the
lip
of
the
precipice
it
was
the
acolytes
who
awaited
them
with
knives
in
their
hands
perhaps
they
had
reached
the
limits
to
which
they
could
retreat
perhaps
the
stygian
girdle
about
conan
waist
could
have
told
why
their
necromantic
spells
had
proven
so
weak
and
so
quickly
exhausted
perhaps
it
was
knowledge
of
death
decreed
for
failure
that
sent
them
leaping
from
among
the
rocks
eyes
glaring
and
knives
glittering
resorting
in
their
desperation
to
material
weapons
there
among
the
rocky
fangs
on
the
precipice
lip
was
no
war
of
wizard
craft
it
was
a
whirl
of
blades
where
real
steel
bit
and
real
blood
spurted
where
sinewy
arms
dealt
forthright
blows
that
severed
quivering
flesh
and
men
went
down
to
be
trodden
under
foot
as
the
fight
raged
over
them
one
of
the
irakzai
bled
to
death
among
the
rocks
but
the
acolytes
were
down
slashed
and
hacked
asunder
or
hurled
over
the
edge
to
float
sluggishly
down
to
the
silver
floor
that
shone
so
far
below
then
the
conquerors
shook
blood
and
sweat
from
their
eyes
and
looked
at
one
another
conan
and
kerim
shah
still
stood
upright
and
four
of
the
irakzai
they
stood
among
the
rocky
teeth
that
serrated
the
precipice
brink
and
from
that
spot
a
path
wound
up
a
gentle
slope
to
a
broad
stair
consisting
of
half
a
dozen
steps
a
hundred
feet
across
cut
out
of
a
green
substance
they
led
up
to
a
broad
stage
or
roofless
gallery
of
the
same
polished
stone
and
above
it
rose
tier
upon
tier
the
castle
of
the
black
seers
it
seemed
to
have
been
carved
out
of
the
sheer
stone
of
the
mountain
the
architecture
was
faultless
but
unadorned
the
many
casements
were
barred
and
masked
with
curtains
within
there
was
no
sign
of
life
friendly
or
hostile
they
went
up
the
path
in
silence
and
warily
as
men
treading
the
lair
of
a
serpent
the
irakzai
were
dumb
like
men
marching
to
a
certain
doom
even
kerim
shah
was
silent
only
conan
seemed
unaware
what
a
monstrous
dislocating
and
uprooting
of
accepted
thought
and
action
their
invasion
constituted
what
an
unprecedented
violation
of
tradition
he
was
not
of
the
east
and
he
came
of
a
breed
who
fought
devils
and
wizards
as
promptly
and
as
they
battled
human
foes
he
strode
up
the
shining
stairs
and
across
the
wide
green
gallery
straight
toward
the
great
teak
door
that
opened
upon
it
he
cast
but
a
single
glance
upward
at
the
higher
tiers
of
the
great
pyramidal
structure
towering
above
him
he
reached
a
hand
for
the
bronze
prong
that
jutted
like
a
handle
from
the
door
then
checked
himself
grinning
hardly
the
handle
was
made
in
the
shape
of
a
serpent
head
lifted
on
arched
neck
and
conan
had
a
suspicion
that
that
metal
head
would
come
to
grisly
life
under
his
hand
he
struck
it
from
the
door
with
one
blow
and
its
bronze
clink
on
the
glassy
floor
did
not
lessen
his
caution
he
flipped
it
aside
with
his
and
again
turned
to
the
door
utter
silence
reigned
over
the
towers
far
below
them
the
mountain
slopes
fell
away
into
a
purple
haze
of
distance
the
sun
glittered
on
peaks
on
either
hand
high
above
a
vulture
hung
like
a
black
dot
in
the
cold
blue
of
the
sky
but
for
it
the
men
before
the
door
were
the
only
evidence
of
life
tiny
figures
on
a
green
jade
gallery
poised
on
the
dizzy
height
with
that
fantastic
pile
of
stone
towering
above
them
a
sharp
wind
off
the
snow
slashed
them
whipping
their
tatters
about
conan
long
knife
splintering
through
the
teak
panels
roused
the
startled
echoes
again
and
again
he
struck
hewing
through
polished
wood
and
metal
bands
alike
through
the
sundered
ruins
he
glared
into
the
interior
alert
and
suspicious
as
a
wolf
he
saw
a
broad
chamber
the
polished
stone
walls
untapestried
the
mosaic
floor
uncarpeted
square
polished
ebon
stools
and
a
stone
dais
formed
the
only
furnishings
the
room
was
empty
of
human
life
another
door
showed
in
the
opposite
wall
a
man
on
guard
outside
grunted
conan
going
in
kerim
shah
designated
a
warrior
for
that
duty
and
the
man
fell
back
toward
the
middle
of
the
gallery
bow
in
hand
conan
strode
into
the
castle
followed
by
the
turanian
and
the
three
remaining
irakzai
the
one
outside
spat
grumbled
in
his
beard
and
started
suddenly
as
a
low
mocking
laugh
reached
his
ears
he
lifted
his
head
and
saw
on
the
tier
above
him
a
tall
figure
naked
head
nodding
slightly
as
he
stared
down
his
whole
attitude
suggested
mockery
and
malignity
quick
as
a
flash
the
irakzai
bent
his
bow
and
loosed
and
the
arrow
streaked
upward
to
strike
full
in
the
breast
the
mocking
smile
did
not
alter
the
seer
plucked
out
the
missile
and
threw
it
back
at
the
bowman
not
as
a
weapon
is
hurled
but
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
the
irakzai
dodged
instinctively
throwing
up
his
arm
his
fingers
closed
on
the
revolving
shaft
then
he
shrieked
in
his
hand
the
wooden
shaft
suddenly
its
rigid
outline
became
pliant
melting
in
his
grasp
he
tried
to
throw
it
from
him
but
it
was
too
late
he
held
a
living
serpent
in
his
naked
hand
and
already
it
had
coiled
about
his
wrist
and
its
wicked
head
darted
at
his
muscular
arm
he
screamed
again
and
his
eyes
became
distended
his
features
purple
he
went
to
his
knees
shaken
by
an
awful
convulsion
and
then
lay
still
the
men
inside
had
wheeled
at
his
first
cry
conan
took
a
swift
stride
toward
the
open
doorway
and
then
halted
short
baffled
to
the
men
behind
him
it
seemed
that
he
strained
against
empty
air
but
though
he
could
see
nothing
there
was
a
slick
smooth
hard
surface
under
his
hands
and
he
knew
that
a
sheet
of
crystal
had
been
let
down
in
the
doorway
through
it
he
saw
the
irakzai
lying
motionless
on
the
glassy
gallery
an
ordinary
arrow
sticking
in
his
arm
conan
lifted
his
knife
and
smote
and
the
watchers
were
dumbfounded
to
see
his
blow
checked
apparently
in
midair
with
the
loud
clang
of
steel
that
meets
an
unyielding
substance
he
wasted
no
more
effort
he
knew
that
not
even
the
legendary
tulwar
of
amir
khurum
could
shatter
that
invisible
curtain
in
a
few
words
he
explained
the
matter
to
kerim
shah
and
the
turanian
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
our
exit
is
barred
we
must
find
another
in
the
meanwhile
our
way
lies
forward
does
it
not
with
a
grunt
the
cimmerian
turned
and
strode
across
the
chamber
to
the
opposite
door
with
a
feeling
of
treading
on
the
threshold
of
doom
as
he
lifted
his
knife
to
shatter
the
door
it
swung
silently
open
as
if
of
its
own
accord
he
strode
into
the
great
hall
flanked
with
tall
glassy
columns
a
hundred
feet
from
the
door
began
the
broad
steps
of
a
stair
that
tapered
toward
the
top
like
the
side
of
a
pyramid
what
lay
beyond
that
stair
he
could
not
tell
but
between
him
and
its
shimmering
foot
stood
a
curious
altar
of
gleaming
black
jade
four
great
golden
serpents
twined
their
tails
about
this
altar
and
reared
their
heads
in
the
air
facing
the
four
quarters
of
the
compass
like
the
enchanted
guardians
of
a
fabled
treasure
but
on
the
altar
between
the
arching
necks
stood
only
a
crystal
globe
filled
with
a
cloudy
substance
in
which
floated
four
golden
pomegranates
the
sight
stirred
some
dim
recollection
in
his
mind
then
conan
heeded
the
altar
no
longer
for
on
the
lower
steps
of
the
stair
stood
four
figures
he
had
not
seen
them
come
they
were
simply
there
tall
gaunt
their
nodding
in
unison
their
feet
and
hands
hidden
by
their
flowing
garments
one
lifted
his
arm
and
the
sleeve
fell
away
revealing
his
hand
and
it
was
not
a
hand
at
all
conan
halted
in
compelled
against
his
will
he
had
encountered
a
force
differing
subtly
from
mesmerism
and
he
could
not
advance
though
he
felt
it
in
his
power
to
retreat
if
he
wished
his
companions
had
likewise
halted
and
they
seemed
even
more
helpless
than
he
unable
to
move
in
either
direction
the
seer
whose
arm
was
lifted
beckoned
to
one
of
the
irakzai
and
the
man
moved
toward
him
like
one
in
a
trance
eyes
staring
and
fixed
blade
hanging
in
limp
fingers
as
he
pushed
past
conan
the
cimmerian
threw
an
arm
across
his
breast
to
arrest
him
conan
was
so
much
stronger
than
the
irakzai
that
in
ordinary
circumstances
he
could
have
broken
his
spine
between
his
hands
but
now
the
muscular
arm
was
brushed
aside
like
straw
and
the
irakzai
moved
toward
the
stair
treading
jerkily
and
mechanically
he
reached
the
steps
and
knelt
stiffly
proffering
his
blade
and
bending
his
head
the
seer
took
the
sword
it
flashed
as
he
swung
it
up
and
down
the
irakzai
head
tumbled
from
his
shoulders
and
thudded
heavily
on
the
black
marble
floor
an
arch
of
blood
jetted
from
the
severed
arteries
and
the
body
slumped
over
and
lay
with
arms
spread
wide
again
a
malformed
hand
lifted
and
beckoned
and
another
irakzai
stumbled
stiffly
to
his
doom
the
ghastly
drama
was
and
another
headless
form
lay
beside
the
first
as
the
third
tribesman
clumped
his
way
past
conan
to
his
death
the
cimmerian
his
veins
bulging
in
his
temples
with
his
efforts
to
break
past
the
unseen
barrier
that
held
him
was
suddenly
aware
of
allied
forces
unseen
but
waking
into
life
about
him
this
realization
came
without
warning
but
so
powerfully
that
he
could
not
doubt
his
instinct
his
left
hand
slid
involuntarily
under
his
bakhariot
belt
and
closed
on
the
stygian
girdle
and
as
he
gripped
it
he
felt
new
strength
flood
his
numbed
limbs
the
will
to
live
was
a
pulsing
fire
matched
by
the
intensity
of
his
burning
rage
the
third
irakzai
was
a
decapitated
corpse
and
the
hideous
finger
was
lifting
again
when
conan
felt
the
bursting
of
the
invisible
barrier
a
fierce
involuntary
cry
burst
from
his
lips
as
he
leaped
with
the
explosive
suddenness
of
ferocity
his
left
hand
gripped
the
sorcerer
girdle
as
a
drowning
man
grips
a
floating
log
and
the
long
knife
was
a
sheen
of
light
in
his
right
the
men
on
the
steps
did
not
move
they
watched
calmly
cynically
if
they
felt
surprise
they
did
not
show
it
conan
did
not
allow
himself
to
think
what
might
chance
when
he
came
within
of
them
his
blood
was
pounding
in
his
temples
a
mist
of
crimson
swam
before
his
sight
he
was
afire
with
the
urge
to
kill
to
drive
his
knife
deep
into
flesh
and
bone
and
twist
the
blade
in
blood
and
entrails
another
dozen
strides
would
carry
him
to
the
steps
where
the
sneering
demons
stood
he
drew
his
breath
deep
his
fury
rising
redly
as
his
charge
gathered
momentum
he
was
hurtling
past
the
altar
with
its
golden
serpents
when
like
a
there
shot
across
his
mind
again
as
vividly
as
if
spoken
in
his
external
ear
the
cryptic
words
of
khemsa
the
crystal
ball
his
reaction
was
almost
without
his
own
volition
execution
followed
impulse
so
spontaneously
that
the
greatest
sorcerer
of
the
age
would
not
have
had
time
to
read
his
mind
and
prevent
his
action
wheeling
like
a
cat
from
his
headlong
charge
he
brought
his
knife
crashing
down
upon
the
crystal
instantly
the
air
vibrated
with
a
peal
of
terror
whether
from
the
stairs
the
altar
or
the
crystal
itself
he
could
not
tell
hisses
filled
his
ears
as
the
golden
serpents
suddenly
vibrant
with
hideous
life
writhed
and
smote
at
him
but
he
was
fired
to
the
speed
of
a
maddened
tiger
a
whirl
of
steel
sheared
through
the
hideous
trunks
that
waved
toward
him
and
he
smote
the
crystal
sphere
again
and
yet
again
and
the
globe
burst
with
a
noise
like
a
thunderclap
raining
fiery
shards
on
the
black
marble
and
the
gold
pomegranates
as
if
released
from
captivity
shot
upward
toward
the
lofty
roof
and
were
gone
a
mad
screaming
bestial
and
ghastly
was
echoing
through
the
great
hall
on
the
steps
writhed
four
figures
twisting
in
convulsions
froth
dripping
from
their
livid
mouths
then
with
one
frenzied
crescendo
of
inhuman
ululation
they
stiffened
and
lay
still
and
conan
knew
that
they
were
dead
he
stared
down
at
the
altar
and
the
crystal
shards
four
headless
golden
serpents
still
coiled
about
the
altar
but
no
alien
life
now
animated
the
dully
gleaming
metal
kerim
shah
was
rising
slowly
from
his
knees
whither
he
had
been
dashed
by
some
unseen
force
he
shook
his
head
to
clear
the
ringing
from
his
ears
you
hear
that
crash
when
you
struck
it
was
as
if
a
thousand
crystal
panels
shattered
all
over
the
castle
as
that
globe
burst
were
the
souls
of
the
wizards
imprisoned
in
those
golden
balls
ha
conan
wheeled
as
kerim
shah
drew
his
sword
and
pointed
another
figure
stood
at
the
head
of
the
stair
his
robe
too
was
black
but
of
richly
embroidered
velvet
and
there
was
a
velvet
cap
on
his
head
his
face
was
calm
and
not
unhandsome
the
devil
are
you
demanded
conan
staring
up
at
him
knife
in
hand
am
the
master
of
yimsha
his
voice
was
like
the
chime
of
a
temple
bell
but
a
note
of
cruel
mirth
ran
through
it
is
yasmina
demanded
kerim
shah
the
master
laughed
down
at
him
is
that
to
you
dead
man
have
you
so
quickly
forgotten
my
strength
once
lent
to
you
that
you
come
armed
against
me
you
poor
fool
i
think
i
will
take
your
heart
kerim
shah
he
held
out
his
hand
as
if
to
receive
something
and
the
turanian
cried
out
sharply
like
a
man
in
mortal
agony
he
reeled
drunkenly
and
then
with
a
splintering
of
bones
a
rending
of
flesh
and
muscle
and
a
snapping
of
his
breast
burst
outward
with
a
shower
of
blood
and
through
the
ghastly
aperture
something
red
and
dripping
shot
through
the
air
into
the
master
outstretched
hand
as
a
bit
of
steel
leaps
to
the
magnet
the
turanian
slumped
to
the
floor
and
lay
motionless
and
the
master
laughed
and
hurled
the
object
to
fall
before
conan
feet
a
human
heart
with
a
roar
and
a
curse
conan
charged
the
stair
from
khemsa
girdle
he
felt
strength
and
deathless
hate
flow
into
him
to
combat
the
terrible
emanation
of
power
that
met
him
on
the
steps
the
air
filled
with
a
shimmering
steely
haze
through
which
he
plunged
like
a
swimmer
head
lowered
left
arm
bent
about
his
face
knife
gripped
low
in
his
right
hand
his
eyes
glaring
over
the
crook
of
his
elbow
made
out
the
hated
shape
of
the
seer
before
and
above
him
the
outline
wavering
as
a
reflection
wavers
in
disturbed
water
he
was
racked
and
torn
by
forces
beyond
his
comprehension
but
he
felt
a
driving
power
outside
and
beyond
his
own
lifting
him
inexorably
upward
and
onward
despite
the
wizard
strength
and
his
own
agony
now
he
had
reached
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
the
master
face
floated
in
the
steely
haze
before
him
and
a
strange
fear
shadowed
the
inscrutable
eyes
conan
waded
through
the
mist
as
through
a
surf
and
his
knife
lunged
upward
like
a
live
thing
the
keen
point
ripped
the
master
robe
as
he
sprang
back
with
a
low
cry
then
before
gaze
the
wizard
vanished
simply
disappeared
like
a
burst
bubble
and
something
long
and
undulating
darted
up
one
of
the
smaller
stairs
that
led
up
to
left
and
right
from
the
landing
conan
charged
after
it
up
the
stair
uncertain
as
to
just
what
he
had
seen
whip
up
those
steps
but
in
a
berserk
mood
that
drowned
the
nausea
and
horror
whispering
at
the
back
of
his
consciousness
he
plunged
out
into
a
broad
corridor
whose
uncarpeted
floor
and
untapestried
walls
were
of
polished
jade
and
something
long
and
swift
whisked
down
the
corridor
ahead
of
him
and
into
a
curtained
door
from
within
the
chamber
rose
a
scream
of
urgent
terror
the
sound
lent
wings
to
conan
flying
feet
and
he
hurtled
through
the
curtains
and
headlong
into
the
chamber
within
a
frightful
scene
met
his
glare
yasmina
cowered
on
the
farther
edge
of
a
dais
screaming
her
loathing
and
horror
an
arm
lifted
as
if
to
ward
off
attack
while
before
her
swayed
the
hideous
head
of
a
giant
serpent
shining
neck
arching
up
from
coils
with
a
choked
cry
conan
threw
his
knife
instantly
the
monster
whirled
and
was
upon
him
like
the
rush
of
wind
through
tall
grass
the
long
knife
quivered
in
its
neck
point
and
a
foot
of
blade
showing
on
one
side
and
the
hilt
and
a
of
steel
on
the
other
but
it
only
seemed
to
madden
the
giant
reptile
the
great
head
towered
above
the
man
who
faced
it
and
then
darted
down
the
jaws
gaping
wide
but
conan
had
plucked
a
dagger
from
his
girdle
and
he
stabbed
upward
as
the
head
dipped
down
the
point
tore
through
the
lower
jaw
and
transfixed
the
upper
pinning
them
together
the
next
instant
the
great
trunk
had
looped
itself
about
the
cimmerian
as
the
snake
unable
to
use
its
fangs
employed
its
remaining
form
of
attack
conan
left
arm
was
pinioned
among
the
folds
but
his
right
was
free
bracing
his
feet
to
keep
upright
he
stretched
forth
his
hand
gripped
the
hilt
of
the
long
knife
jutting
from
the
neck
and
tore
it
free
in
a
shower
of
blood
as
if
divining
his
purpose
with
more
than
bestial
intelligence
the
snake
writhed
and
knotted
seeking
to
cast
its
loops
about
his
right
arm
but
with
the
speed
of
light
the
long
knife
rose
and
fell
shearing
halfway
through
the
reptile
giant
trunk
before
he
could
strike
again
the
great
pliant
loops
fell
from
him
and
the
monster
dragged
itself
across
the
floor
gushing
blood
from
its
ghastly
wounds
conan
sprang
after
it
knife
lifted
but
his
vicious
swipe
cut
empty
air
as
the
serpent
writhed
away
from
him
and
struck
its
blunt
nose
against
a
paneled
screen
of
sandalwood
one
of
the
panels
gave
inward
and
the
long
bleeding
barrel
whipped
through
it
and
was
gone
conan
instantly
attacked
the
screen
a
few
blows
rent
it
apart
and
he
glared
into
the
dim
alcove
beyond
no
horrific
shape
coiled
there
there
was
blood
on
the
marble
floor
and
bloody
tracks
led
to
a
cryptic
arched
door
those
tracks
were
of
a
man
bare
feet
he
wheeled
back
into
the
chamber
just
in
time
to
catch
the
devi
of
vendhya
in
his
arms
as
she
rushed
across
the
room
and
threw
herself
upon
him
catching
him
about
the
neck
with
a
frantic
clasp
half
hysterical
with
terror
and
gratitude
and
relief
his
wild
blood
had
been
stirred
to
its
uttermost
by
all
that
had
passed
he
caught
her
to
him
in
a
grasp
that
would
have
made
her
wince
at
another
time
and
crushed
her
lips
with
his
she
made
no
resistance
the
devi
was
drowned
in
the
elemental
woman
she
closed
her
eyes
and
drank
in
his
fierce
hot
lawless
kisses
with
all
the
abandon
of
passionate
thirst
she
was
panting
with
his
violence
when
he
ceased
for
breath
and
glared
down
at
her
lying
limp
in
his
mighty
arms
knew
you
come
for
me
she
murmured
would
not
leave
me
in
this
den
of
devils
at
her
words
recollection
of
their
environment
came
to
him
suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
and
listened
intently
silence
reigned
over
the
castle
of
yimsha
but
it
was
a
silence
impregnated
with
menace
peril
crouched
in
every
corner
leered
invisibly
from
every
hanging
better
go
while
we
can
he
muttered
cuts
were
enough
to
kill
any
common
beast
or
but
a
wizard
has
a
dozen
lives
wound
one
and
he
writhes
away
like
a
crippled
snake
to
soak
up
fresh
venom
from
some
source
of
sorcery
he
picked
up
the
girl
and
carrying
her
in
his
arms
like
a
child
he
strode
out
into
the
gleaming
jade
corridor
and
down
the
stairs
nerves
tautly
alert
for
any
sign
or
sound
met
the
master
she
whispered
clinging
to
him
and
shuddering
worked
his
spells
on
me
to
break
my
will
the
most
awful
thing
was
a
moldering
corpse
which
seized
me
in
its
arms
i
fainted
then
and
lay
as
one
dead
i
do
not
know
how
long
shortly
after
i
regained
consciousness
i
heard
sounds
of
strife
below
and
cries
and
then
that
snake
came
slithering
through
the
curtains
ah
she
shook
at
the
memory
of
that
horror
knew
somehow
that
it
was
not
an
illusion
but
a
real
serpent
that
sought
my
life
was
not
a
shadow
at
least
answered
conan
cryptically
knew
he
was
beaten
and
chose
to
slay
you
rather
than
let
you
be
rescued
do
you
mean
she
asked
uneasily
and
then
shrank
against
him
crying
out
and
forgetting
her
question
she
had
seen
the
corpses
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
those
of
the
seers
were
not
good
to
look
at
as
they
lay
twisted
and
contorted
their
hands
and
feet
were
exposed
to
view
and
at
the
sight
yasmina
went
livid
and
hid
her
face
against
conan
powerful
shoulder
yasmina
and
conan
conan
passed
through
the
hall
quickly
enough
traversed
the
outer
chamber
and
approached
the
door
that
led
upon
the
gallery
then
he
saw
the
floor
sprinkled
with
tiny
glittering
shards
the
crystal
sheet
that
had
covered
the
doorway
had
been
shivered
to
bits
and
he
remembered
the
crash
that
had
accompanied
the
shattering
of
the
crystal
globe
he
believed
that
every
piece
of
crystal
in
the
castle
had
broken
at
that
instant
and
some
dim
instinct
or
memory
of
esoteric
lore
vaguely
suggested
the
truth
of
the
monstrous
connection
between
the
lords
of
the
black
circle
and
the
golden
pomegranates
he
felt
the
short
hair
bristle
chilly
at
the
back
of
his
neck
and
put
the
matter
hastily
out
of
his
mind
he
breathed
a
deep
sigh
of
relief
as
he
stepped
out
upon
the
green
jade
gallery
there
was
still
the
gorge
to
cross
but
at
least
he
could
see
the
white
peaks
glistening
in
the
sun
and
the
long
slopes
falling
away
into
the
distant
blue
hazes
the
irakzai
lay
where
he
had
fallen
an
ugly
blotch
on
the
glassy
smoothness
as
conan
strode
down
the
winding
path
he
was
surprised
to
note
the
position
of
the
sun
it
had
not
yet
passed
its
zenith
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
hours
had
passed
since
he
plunged
into
the
castle
of
the
black
seers
he
felt
an
urge
to
hasten
not
a
mere
blind
panic
but
an
instinct
of
peril
growing
behind
his
back
he
said
nothing
to
yasmina
and
she
seemed
content
to
nestle
her
dark
head
against
his
arching
breast
and
find
security
in
the
clasp
of
his
iron
arms
he
paused
an
instant
on
the
brink
of
the
chasm
frowning
down
the
haze
which
danced
in
the
gorge
was
no
longer
and
sparkling
it
was
smoky
dim
ghostly
like
the
that
flickered
thinly
in
a
wounded
man
the
thought
came
vaguely
to
conan
that
the
spells
of
magicians
were
more
closely
bound
to
their
personal
beings
than
were
the
actions
of
common
men
to
the
actors
but
far
below
the
floor
shone
like
tarnished
silver
and
the
gold
thread
sparkled
undimmed
conan
shifted
yasmina
across
his
shoulder
where
she
lay
docilely
and
began
the
descent
hurriedly
he
descended
the
ramp
and
hurriedly
he
fled
across
the
echoing
floor
he
had
a
conviction
that
they
were
racing
with
time
that
their
chances
of
survival
depended
upon
crossing
that
gorge
of
horrors
before
the
wounded
master
of
the
castle
should
regain
enough
power
to
loose
some
other
doom
upon
them
when
he
toiled
up
the
farther
ramp
and
came
out
upon
the
crest
he
breathed
a
gusty
sigh
of
relief
and
stood
yasmina
upon
her
feet
walk
from
here
he
told
her
downhill
all
the
way
she
stole
a
glance
at
the
gleaming
pyramid
across
the
chasm
it
reared
up
against
the
snowy
slope
like
the
citadel
of
silence
and
immemorial
evil
you
a
magician
that
you
have
conquered
the
black
seers
of
yimsha
conan
of
ghor
she
asked
as
they
went
down
the
path
with
his
heavy
arm
about
her
supple
waist
was
a
girdle
khemsa
gave
me
before
he
died
conan
answered
i
found
him
on
the
trail
it
is
a
curious
one
which
i
show
you
when
i
have
time
against
some
spells
it
was
weak
but
against
others
it
was
strong
and
a
good
knife
is
always
a
hearty
incantation
if
the
girdle
aided
you
in
conquering
the
master
she
argued
did
it
not
aid
khemsa
he
shook
his
head
knows
but
khemsa
had
been
the
master
slave
perhaps
that
weakened
its
magic
he
had
no
hold
on
me
as
he
had
on
khemsa
yet
i
ca
say
that
i
conquered
him
he
retreated
but
i
have
a
feeling
that
we
have
seen
the
last
of
him
i
want
to
put
as
many
miles
between
us
and
his
lair
as
we
can
he
was
further
relieved
to
find
horses
tethered
among
the
tamarisks
as
he
had
left
them
he
loosed
them
swiftly
and
mounted
the
black
stallion
swinging
the
girl
up
before
him
the
others
followed
freshened
by
their
rest
what
now
she
asked
afghulistan
just
now
he
grinned
hardly
maybe
the
governor
killed
my
seven
headmen
my
idiotic
followers
think
i
had
something
to
do
with
it
and
unless
i
am
able
to
convince
them
otherwise
they
hunt
me
like
a
wounded
jackal
what
of
me
if
the
headmen
are
dead
i
am
useless
to
you
as
a
hostage
will
you
slay
me
to
avenge
them
he
looked
down
at
her
with
eyes
fiercely
aglow
and
laughed
at
the
suggestion
let
us
ride
to
the
border
she
said
be
safe
from
the
afghulis
there
on
a
vendhyan
gibbet
am
queen
of
vendhya
she
reminded
him
with
a
touch
of
her
old
imperiousness
have
saved
my
life
you
shall
be
rewarded
she
did
not
intend
it
as
it
sounded
but
he
growled
in
his
throat
ill
pleased
your
bounty
for
your
dogs
princess
if
you
a
queen
of
the
plains
i
a
chief
of
the
hills
and
not
one
foot
toward
the
border
will
i
take
you
you
would
be
safe
she
began
bewilderedly
you
be
the
devi
again
he
broke
in
girl
i
prefer
you
as
you
are
now
a
woman
of
flesh
and
blood
riding
on
my
you
ca
me
she
cried
ca
and
see
he
advised
grimly
i
will
pay
you
a
vast
ransom
take
your
ransom
he
answered
roughly
his
arms
hardening
about
her
supple
figure
kingdom
of
vendhya
could
give
me
nothing
i
desire
half
so
much
as
i
desire
you
i
took
you
at
the
risk
of
my
neck
if
your
courtiers
want
you
back
let
them
come
up
the
zhaibar
and
fight
for
you
you
have
no
followers
now
she
protested
are
hunted
how
can
you
preserve
your
own
life
much
less
mine
still
have
friends
in
the
hills
he
answered
is
a
chief
of
the
khurakzai
who
will
keep
you
safely
while
i
bicker
with
the
afghulis
if
they
will
have
none
of
me
by
crom
i
will
ride
northward
with
you
to
the
steppes
of
the
i
was
a
hetman
among
the
free
companions
before
i
rode
southward
i
make
you
a
queen
on
the
zaporoska
river
i
can
not
she
objected
must
not
hold
me
the
idea
so
repulsive
he
demanded
did
you
yield
your
lips
to
me
so
willingly
a
queen
is
human
she
answered
coloring
because
i
am
a
queen
i
must
consider
my
kingdom
do
not
carry
me
away
into
some
foreign
country
come
back
to
vendhya
with
me
you
make
me
your
king
he
asked
sardonically
there
are
customs
she
stammered
and
he
interrupted
her
with
a
hard
laugh
civilized
customs
that
wo
let
you
do
as
you
wish
you
marry
some
withered
old
king
of
the
plains
and
i
can
go
my
way
with
only
the
memory
of
a
few
kisses
snatched
from
your
lips
ha
i
must
return
to
my
kingdom
she
repeated
helplessly
he
demanded
angrily
chafe
your
rump
on
gold
thrones
and
listen
to
the
plaudits
of
smirking
fools
where
is
the
gain
listen
i
was
born
in
the
cimmerian
hills
where
the
people
are
all
barbarians
i
have
been
a
mercenary
soldier
a
corsair
a
and
a
hundred
other
things
what
king
has
roamed
the
countries
fought
the
battles
loved
the
women
and
won
the
plunder
that
i
have
came
into
ghulistan
to
raise
a
horde
and
plunder
the
kingdoms
to
the
south
your
own
among
them
being
chief
of
the
afghulis
was
only
a
start
if
i
can
conciliate
them
i
have
a
dozen
tribes
following
me
within
a
year
but
if
i
ca
i
ride
back
to
the
steppes
and
loot
the
turanian
borders
with
the
and
you
go
with
me
to
the
devil
with
your
kingdom
they
fended
for
themselves
before
you
were
born
she
lay
in
his
arms
looking
up
at
him
and
she
felt
a
tug
at
her
spirit
a
lawless
reckless
urge
that
matched
his
own
and
was
by
it
called
into
being
but
a
thousand
generations
of
sovereignship
rode
heavy
upon
her
ca
i
ca
she
repeated
helplessly
have
any
choice
he
assured
her
what
the
devil
they
had
left
yimsha
some
miles
behind
them
and
were
riding
along
a
high
ridge
that
separated
two
deep
valleys
they
had
just
topped
a
steep
crest
where
they
could
gaze
down
into
the
valley
on
their
right
hand
and
there
was
a
running
fight
in
progress
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
away
from
them
carrying
the
sound
from
their
ears
but
even
so
the
clashing
of
steel
and
thunder
of
hoofs
welled
up
from
far
below
they
saw
the
glint
of
the
sun
on
and
spired
helmet
three
thousand
mailed
horsemen
were
driving
before
them
a
ragged
band
of
turbaned
riders
who
fled
snarling
and
striking
like
fleeing
wolves
muttered
conan
from
secunderam
what
the
devil
are
they
doing
here
are
the
men
they
pursue
asked
yasmina
why
do
they
fall
back
so
stubbornly
they
can
not
stand
against
such
odds
hundred
of
my
mad
afghulis
he
growled
scowling
down
into
the
vale
in
a
trap
and
they
know
it
the
valley
was
indeed
a
at
that
end
it
narrowed
to
a
gorge
opening
out
further
into
a
round
bowl
completely
rimmed
with
lofty
unscalable
walls
the
turbaned
riders
were
being
forced
into
this
gorge
because
there
was
nowhere
else
for
them
to
go
and
they
went
reluctantly
in
a
shower
of
arrows
and
a
whirl
of
swords
the
helmeted
riders
harried
them
but
did
not
press
in
too
rashly
they
knew
the
desperate
fury
of
the
hill
tribes
and
they
knew
too
that
they
had
their
prey
in
a
trap
from
which
there
was
no
escape
they
had
recognized
the
as
afghulis
and
they
wished
to
hem
them
in
and
force
a
surrender
they
needed
hostages
for
the
purpose
they
had
in
mind
their
emir
was
a
man
of
decision
and
initiative
when
he
reached
the
gurashah
valley
and
found
neither
guides
nor
emissary
waiting
for
him
he
pushed
on
trusting
to
his
own
knowledge
of
the
country
all
the
way
from
secunderam
there
had
been
fighting
and
tribesmen
were
licking
their
wounds
in
many
a
village
he
knew
there
was
a
good
chance
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
his
helmeted
spearmen
would
ever
ride
through
the
gates
of
secunderam
again
for
the
tribes
would
all
be
up
behind
him
now
but
he
was
determined
to
carry
out
his
orders
which
were
to
take
yasmina
devi
from
the
afghulis
at
all
costs
and
to
bring
her
captive
to
secunderam
or
if
confronted
by
impossibility
to
strike
off
her
head
before
he
himself
died
of
all
this
of
course
the
watchers
on
the
ridge
were
not
aware
but
conan
fidgeted
with
nervousness
the
devil
did
they
get
themselves
trapped
he
demanded
of
the
universe
at
large
know
what
they
doing
in
these
parts
they
were
hunting
me
the
dogs
poking
into
every
valley
and
found
themselves
penned
in
before
they
knew
it
the
poor
fools
they
making
a
stand
in
the
gorge
but
they
ca
hold
out
for
long
when
the
turanians
have
pushed
them
back
into
the
bowl
they
slaughter
them
at
their
leisure
the
din
welling
up
from
below
increased
in
volume
and
intensity
in
the
strait
of
the
narrow
gut
the
afghulis
fighting
desperately
were
for
the
time
holding
their
own
against
the
mailed
riders
who
could
not
throw
their
whole
weight
against
them
conan
scowled
darkly
moved
restlessly
fingering
his
hilt
and
finally
spoke
bluntly
i
must
go
down
to
them
i
find
a
place
for
you
to
hide
until
i
come
back
to
you
you
spoke
of
your
kingdom
well
i
do
pretend
to
look
on
those
hairy
devils
as
my
children
but
after
all
such
as
they
are
they
my
henchmen
a
chief
should
never
desert
his
followers
even
if
they
desert
him
first
they
think
they
were
right
in
kicking
me
out
hell
i
wo
be
cast
off
i
still
chief
of
the
afghulis
and
i
prove
it
i
can
climb
down
on
foot
into
the
gorge
what
of
me
she
queried
carried
me
away
forcibly
from
people
now
will
you
leave
me
to
die
in
the
hills
alone
while
you
go
down
and
sacrifice
yourself
uselessly
his
veins
swelled
with
the
conflict
of
his
emotions
right
he
muttered
helplessly
knows
what
i
do
she
turned
her
head
slightly
a
curious
expression
dawning
on
her
beautiful
face
then
she
cried
a
distant
fanfare
of
trumpets
was
borne
faintly
to
their
ears
they
stared
into
the
deep
valley
on
the
left
and
caught
a
glint
of
steel
on
the
farther
side
a
long
line
of
lances
and
polished
helmets
moved
along
the
vale
gleaming
in
the
sunlight
riders
of
vendhya
she
cried
exultingly
are
thousands
of
them
muttered
conan
has
been
long
since
a
kshatriya
host
has
ridden
this
far
into
the
hills
are
searching
for
me
she
exclaimed
me
your
horse
i
will
ride
to
my
warriors
the
ridge
is
not
so
precipitous
on
the
left
and
i
can
reach
the
valley
floor
i
will
lead
my
horsemen
into
the
valley
at
the
upper
end
and
fall
upon
the
turanians
we
will
crush
them
in
the
vise
quick
conan
will
you
sacrifice
your
men
to
your
own
desire
the
burning
hunger
of
the
steppes
and
the
wintry
forests
glared
out
of
his
eyes
but
he
shook
his
head
and
swung
off
the
stallion
placing
the
reins
in
her
hands
win
he
grunted
like
the
devil
she
wheeled
away
down
the
slope
and
he
ran
swiftly
along
the
ridge
until
he
reached
the
long
ragged
cleft
that
was
the
defile
in
which
the
fight
raged
down
the
rugged
wall
he
scrambled
like
an
ape
clinging
to
projections
and
crevices
to
fall
at
last
feet
first
into
the
mêlée
that
raged
in
the
mouth
of
the
gorge
blades
were
whickering
and
clanging
about
him
horses
rearing
and
stamping
helmet
plumes
nodding
among
turbans
that
were
stained
crimson
as
he
hit
he
yelled
like
a
wolf
caught
a
rein
and
dodging
the
sweep
of
a
scimitar
drove
his
long
knife
upward
through
the
vitals
in
another
instant
he
was
in
the
saddle
yelling
ferocious
orders
to
the
afghulis
they
stared
at
him
stupidly
for
an
instant
then
as
they
saw
the
havoc
his
steel
was
wreaking
among
their
enemies
they
fell
to
their
work
again
accepting
him
without
comment
in
that
inferno
of
licking
blades
and
spurting
blood
there
was
no
time
to
ask
or
answer
questions
the
riders
in
their
spired
helmets
and
hauberks
swarmed
about
the
gorge
mouth
thrusting
and
slashing
and
the
narrow
defile
was
packed
and
jammed
with
horses
and
men
the
warriors
crushed
breast
to
breast
stabbing
with
shortened
blades
slashing
murderously
when
there
was
an
instant
room
to
swing
a
sword
when
a
man
went
down
he
did
not
get
up
from
beneath
the
stamping
swirling
hoofs
weight
and
sheer
strength
counted
heavily
there
and
the
chief
of
the
afghulis
did
the
work
of
ten
at
such
times
accustomed
habits
sway
men
strongly
and
the
warriors
who
were
used
to
seeing
conan
in
their
vanguard
were
heartened
mightily
despite
their
distrust
of
him
but
superior
numbers
counted
too
the
pressure
of
the
men
behind
forced
the
horsemen
of
turan
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
gorge
in
the
teeth
of
the
flickering
tulwars
foot
by
foot
the
afghulis
were
shoved
back
leaving
the
carpeted
with
dead
on
which
the
riders
trampled
as
he
hacked
and
smote
like
a
man
possessed
conan
had
time
for
some
chilling
doubts
would
yasmina
keep
her
word
she
had
but
to
join
her
warriors
turn
southward
and
leave
him
and
his
band
to
perish
but
at
last
after
what
seemed
centuries
of
desperate
battling
in
the
valley
outside
there
rose
another
sound
above
the
clash
of
steel
and
yells
of
slaughter
and
then
with
a
burst
of
trumpets
that
shook
the
walls
and
rushing
thunder
of
hoofs
five
thousand
riders
of
vendhya
smote
the
hosts
of
secunderam
that
stroke
split
the
turanian
squadrons
asunder
shattered
tore
and
rent
them
and
scattered
their
fragments
all
over
the
valley
in
an
instant
the
surge
had
ebbed
back
out
of
the
gorge
there
was
a
chaotic
confused
swirl
of
fighting
horsemen
wheeling
and
smiting
singly
and
in
clusters
and
then
the
emir
went
down
with
a
kshatriya
lance
through
his
breast
and
the
riders
in
their
spired
helmets
turned
their
horses
down
the
valley
spurring
like
mad
and
seeking
to
slash
a
way
through
the
swarms
which
had
come
upon
them
from
the
rear
as
they
scattered
in
flight
the
conquerors
scattered
in
pursuit
and
all
across
the
valley
floor
and
up
on
the
slopes
near
the
mouth
and
over
the
crests
streamed
the
fugitives
and
the
pursuers
the
afghulis
those
left
to
ride
rushed
out
of
the
gorge
and
joined
in
the
harrying
of
their
foes
accepting
the
unexpected
alliance
as
unquestioningly
as
they
had
accepted
the
return
of
their
repudiated
chief
the
sun
was
sinking
toward
the
distant
crags
when
conan
his
garments
hacked
to
tatters
and
the
mail
under
them
reeking
and
clotted
with
blood
his
knife
dripping
and
crusted
to
the
hilt
strode
over
the
corpses
to
where
yasmina
devi
sat
her
horse
among
her
nobles
on
the
crest
of
the
ridge
near
a
lofty
precipice
kept
your
word
devi
he
roared
crom
though
i
had
some
bad
seconds
down
in
that
gorge
out
down
from
the
sky
swooped
a
vulture
of
tremendous
size
with
a
thunder
of
wings
that
knocked
men
sprawling
from
their
horses
the
beak
was
slashing
for
the
devi
soft
neck
but
conan
was
quicker
a
short
run
a
tigerish
leap
the
savage
thrust
of
a
dripping
knife
and
the
vulture
voiced
a
horribly
human
cry
pitched
sideways
and
went
tumbling
down
the
cliffs
to
the
rocks
and
river
a
thousand
feet
below
as
it
dropped
its
black
wings
thrashing
the
air
it
took
on
the
semblance
not
of
a
bird
but
of
a
human
body
that
fell
arms
in
wide
black
sleeves
thrown
abroad
conan
turned
to
yasmina
his
red
knife
still
in
his
hand
his
blue
eyes
smoldering
blood
oozing
from
wounds
on
his
thickly
muscled
arms
and
thighs
are
the
devi
again
he
said
grinning
fiercely
at
the
gossamer
robe
she
had
donned
over
her
attire
and
awed
not
at
all
by
the
imposing
array
of
chivalry
about
him
have
you
to
thank
for
the
lives
of
some
three
hundred
and
fifty
of
my
rogues
who
are
at
least
convinced
that
i
did
betray
them
you
have
put
my
hands
on
the
reins
of
conquest
again
still
owe
you
my
ransom
she
said
her
dark
eyes
glowing
as
they
swept
over
him
thousand
pieces
of
gold
i
will
pay
you
he
made
a
savage
impatient
gesture
shook
the
blood
from
his
knife
and
thrust
it
back
in
its
scabbard
wiping
his
hands
on
his
mail
will
collect
your
ransom
in
my
own
way
at
my
own
time
he
said
will
collect
it
in
your
palace
at
ayodhya
and
i
will
come
with
fifty
thousand
men
to
see
that
the
scales
are
fair
she
laughed
gathering
her
reins
into
her
hands
i
will
meet
you
on
the
shores
of
the
jhumda
with
a
hundred
thousand
his
eyes
shone
with
fierce
appreciation
and
admiration
and
stepping
back
he
lifted
his
hand
with
a
gesture
that
was
like
the
assumption
of
kingship
indicating
that
her
road
was
clear
before
her
