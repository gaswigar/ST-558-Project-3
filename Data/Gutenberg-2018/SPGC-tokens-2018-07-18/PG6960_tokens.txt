mary
jemison

the

only
about
twelve

of
age
and
has

and

jemison
captivity
together
with
some
anecdotes
and
other
entertaining
matter
by
james
seaver
preface
that
to
biographical
writings
we
are
indebted
for
the
greatest
and
best
field
in
which
to
study
mankind
or
human
nature
is
a
fact
duly
appreciated
by
a
community
in
them
we
can
trace
the
effects
of
mental
operations
to
their
proper
sources
and
by
comparing
our
own
composition
with
that
of
those
who
have
excelled
in
virtue
or
with
that
of
those
who
have
been
sunk
in
the
lowest
depths
of
folly
and
vice
we
are
enabled
to
select
a
plan
of
life
that
will
at
least
afford
and
guide
us
through
the
world
in
paths
of
morality
without
a
knowledge
of
the
lives
of
the
vile
and
abandoned
we
should
be
wholly
incompetent
to
set
an
appropriate
value
upon
the
charms
the
excellence
and
the
worth
of
those
principles
which
have
produced
the
finest
traits
in
the
character
of
the
most
virtuous
biography
is
a
telescope
of
life
through
which
we
can
see
the
extremes
and
excesses
of
the
varied
properties
of
the
human
heart
wisdom
and
folly
refinement
and
vulgarity
love
and
hatred
tenderness
and
cruelty
happiness
and
misery
piety
and
infidelity
commingled
with
every
other
cardinal
virtue
or
vice
are
to
be
seen
on
the
variegated
pages
of
the
history
of
human
events
and
are
eminently
deserving
the
attention
of
those
who
would
learn
to
walk
in
the
paths
of
peace
the
brazen
statue
and
the
sculptured
marble
can
commemorate
the
greatness
of
heroes
statesmen
philosophers
and
conquerors
who
have
risen
to
the
zenith
of
human
glory
and
popularity
under
the
influence
of
the
mild
sun
of
prosperity
but
it
is
the
faithful
page
of
biography
that
transmits
to
future
generations
the
poverty
pain
wrong
hunger
wretchedness
and
torment
and
every
nameless
misery
that
has
been
endured
by
those
who
have
lived
in
obscurity
and
groped
their
lonely
way
through
a
long
series
of
unpropitious
events
with
but
little
help
besides
the
light
of
nature
while
the
gilded
monument
displays
in
brightest
colors
the
vanity
of
pomp
and
the
emptiness
of
nominal
greatness
the
biographical
page
that
lives
in
every
line
is
giving
lessons
of
fortitude
in
time
of
danger
patience
in
suffering
hope
in
distress
invention
in
necessity
and
resignation
to
unavoidable
evils
here
also
may
be
learned
pity
for
the
bereaved
benevolence
for
the
destitute
and
compassion
for
the
helpless
and
at
the
same
time
all
the
sympathies
of
the
soul
will
be
naturally
excited
to
sigh
at
the
unfavorable
result
or
to
smile
at
the
fortunate
relief
in
the
great
inexplicable
chain
which
forms
the
circle
of
human
events
each
individual
link
is
placed
on
a
level
with
the
others
and
performs
an
equal
task
but
as
the
world
is
partial
it
is
the
situation
that
attracts
the
attention
of
mankind
and
excites
the
unfortunate
vociferous
eclat
of
elevation
that
raises
the
pampered
parasite
to
such
an
immense
height
in
the
scale
of
personal
vanity
as
generally
to
deprive
him
of
respect
before
he
can
return
to
a
state
of
equilibrium
with
his
fellows
or
to
the
place
whence
he
started
few
great
men
have
passed
from
the
stage
of
action
who
have
not
left
in
the
history
of
their
lives
indelible
marks
of
ambition
or
folly
which
produced
insurmountable
reverses
and
rendered
the
whole
a
mere
caricature
that
can
be
examined
only
with
disgust
and
regret
such
pictures
however
are
profitable
for
by
others
faults
wise
men
correct
their
own
the
following
is
a
piece
of
biography
that
shows
what
changes
may
be
effected
in
the
animal
and
mental
constitution
of
man
what
trials
may
be
surmounted
what
cruelties
perpetrated
and
what
pain
endured
when
stern
necessity
holds
the
reins
and
drives
the
car
of
fate
as
books
of
this
kind
are
sought
and
read
with
avidity
especially
by
children
and
are
well
calculated
to
excite
their
attention
inform
their
understanding
and
improve
them
in
the
art
of
reading
the
greatest
care
has
been
observed
to
render
the
style
easy
the
language
comprehensive
and
the
description
natural
prolixity
has
been
studiously
avoided
the
line
of
distinction
between
virtue
and
vice
has
been
rendered
distinctly
visible
and
chastity
of
expression
and
sentiment
have
received
due
attention
strict
fidelity
has
been
observed
in
the
composition
consequently
no
circumstance
has
been
intentionally
exaggerated
by
the
paintings
of
fancy
nor
by
fine
flashes
of
rhetoric
neither
has
the
picture
been
rendered
more
dull
than
the
original
without
the
aid
of
fiction
what
was
received
as
matter
of
fact
only
has
been
recorded
it
will
be
observed
that
the
subject
of
this
narrative
has
arrived
at
least
to
the
advanced
age
of
eighty
years
that
she
is
destitute
of
education
and
that
her
journey
of
life
throughout
its
texture
has
been
interwoven
with
troubles
which
ordinarily
are
calculated
to
impair
the
faculties
of
the
mind
and
it
will
be
remembered
that
there
are
but
few
old
people
who
can
recollect
with
precision
the
circumstances
of
their
lives
particularly
those
circumstances
which
transpired
after
middle
age
if
therefore
any
error
shall
be
discovered
in
the
narration
in
respect
to
time
it
will
be
overlooked
by
the
kind
reader
or
charitably
placed
to
the
narrator
account
and
not
imputed
to
neglect
or
to
the
want
of
attention
in
the
compiler
the
appendix
is
principally
taken
from
the
words
of
statements
those
parts
which
were
not
derived
from
her
are
deserving
equal
credit
having
been
obtained
from
authentic
sources
for
the
accommodation
of
the
reader
the
work
has
been
divided
into
chapters
and
a
copious
table
of
contents
affixed
the
introduction
will
facilitate
the
understanding
of
what
follows
and
as
it
contains
matter
that
could
not
be
inserted
with
propriety
in
any
other
place
will
be
read
with
interest
and
satisfaction
having
finished
my
undertaking
the
subsequent
pages
are
cheerfully
submitted
to
the
perusal
and
approbation
or
animadversion
of
a
candid
generous
and
indulgent
public
at
the
same
time
it
is
fondly
hoped
that
the
lessons
of
distress
that
are
portrayed
may
have
a
direct
tendency
to
increase
our
love
of
liberty
to
enlarge
our
views
of
the
blessings
that
are
derived
from
our
liberal
institutions
and
to
excite
in
our
breasts
sentiments
of
devotion
and
gratitude
to
the
great
author
and
finisher
of
our
happiness
the
author
introduction
the
peace
of
and
the
consequent
cessation
of
indian
hostilities
and
barbarities
returned
to
their
friends
those
prisoners
who
had
escaped
the
tomahawk
the
gauntlet
and
the
savage
fire
after
their
having
spent
many
years
in
captivity
and
restored
harmony
to
society
the
stories
of
indian
cruelties
which
were
common
in
the
new
settlements
and
were
calamitous
realities
previous
to
that
propitious
event
slumbered
in
the
minds
that
had
been
constantly
agitated
by
them
and
were
only
roused
occasionally
to
become
the
fearful
topic
of
the
fireside
it
is
presumed
that
at
this
time
there
are
but
few
native
americans
that
have
arrived
to
middle
age
who
can
not
distinctly
recollect
of
sitting
in
the
chimney
corner
when
children
all
contracted
with
fear
and
there
listening
to
their
parents
or
visitors
while
they
related
stories
of
indian
conquests
and
murders
that
would
make
their
flaxen
hair
nearly
stand
erect
and
almost
destroy
the
power
of
motion
at
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
all
that
part
of
the
state
of
that
lies
west
of
utica
was
uninhabited
by
white
people
and
few
indeed
had
ever
passed
beyond
fort
stanwix
except
when
engaged
in
war
against
the
indians
who
were
numerous
and
occupied
a
number
of
large
towns
between
the
mohawk
river
and
lake
erie
sometime
elapsed
after
this
event
before
the
country
about
the
lakes
and
on
the
genesee
river
was
visited
save
by
an
occasional
land
speculator
or
by
defaulters
who
wished
by
retreating
to
what
in
those
days
was
deemed
almost
the
end
of
the
earth
to
escape
the
force
of
civil
law
at
length
the
richness
and
fertility
of
the
soil
excited
emigration
and
here
and
there
a
family
settled
down
and
commenced
improvements
in
the
country
which
had
recently
been
the
property
of
the
aborigines
those
who
settled
near
the
genesee
river
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
white
woman
as
jemison
is
called
whose
history
they
anxiously
sought
both
as
a
matter
of
interest
and
curiosity
frankness
characterized
her
conduct
and
without
reserve
she
would
readily
gratify
them
by
relating
some
of
the
most
important
periods
of
her
life
although
her
bosom
companion
was
an
ancient
indian
warrior
and
notwithstanding
her
children
and
associates
were
all
indians
yet
it
was
found
that
she
possessed
an
uncommon
share
of
hospitality
and
that
her
friendship
was
well
worth
courting
and
preserving
her
house
was
the
stranger
home
from
her
table
the
hungry
were
refreshed
she
made
the
naked
as
comfortable
as
her
means
would
admit
of
and
in
all
her
actions
discovered
so
much
natural
goodness
of
heart
that
her
admirers
increases
in
proportion
to
the
extension
of
her
acquaintance
and
she
became
celebrated
as
the
friend
of
the
distressed
she
was
the
protectress
of
the
homeless
fugitive
and
made
welcome
the
weary
wanderer
many
still
live
to
commemorate
her
benevolence
towards
them
when
prisoners
during
the
war
and
to
ascribe
their
deliverance
to
the
mediation
of
the
white
woman
the
settlements
increased
and
the
whole
country
around
her
was
inhabited
by
a
rich
and
respectable
people
principally
from
as
much
distinguished
for
their
spirit
of
inquisitiveness
as
for
their
habits
of
industry
and
honesty
who
had
all
heard
from
one
source
and
another
a
part
of
her
life
in
detached
pieces
and
had
obtained
an
idea
that
the
whole
taken
in
connection
would
afford
instruction
and
amusement
many
gentlemen
of
respectability
felt
anxious
that
her
narrative
might
be
laid
before
the
public
with
a
view
not
only
to
perpetuate
the
remembrance
of
the
atrocities
of
the
savages
in
former
times
but
to
preserve
some
historical
facts
which
they
supposed
to
be
intimately
connected
with
her
life
and
which
otherwise
must
be
lost
forty
years
had
passed
since
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
and
almost
seventy
years
had
seen
jemison
with
the
indians
when
daniel
banister
esq
at
the
instance
of
several
gentlemen
and
prompted
by
his
own
ambition
to
add
something
to
the
accumulating
fund
of
useful
knowledge
resolved
in
the
autumn
of
to
embrace
that
time
while
she
was
capable
of
recollecting
and
reciting
the
scenes
through
which
she
had
passed
to
collect
from
herself
and
to
publish
to
an
accurate
account
of
her
life
i
was
employed
to
collect
the
materials
and
prepare
the
work
for
the
press
and
accordingly
went
to
the
house
of
jennet
whaley
in
the
town
of
castile
genesee
in
company
with
the
publisher
who
procured
the
interesting
subject
of
the
following
narrative
to
come
to
that
place
a
distance
of
four
miles
and
there
repeat
the
story
of
her
eventful
life
she
came
on
foot
in
company
with
thomas
clute
whom
she
considers
her
protector
and
tarried
almost
three
days
which
time
was
busily
occupied
in
taking
a
sketch
of
her
narrative
as
she
recited
it
her
appearance
was
well
calculated
to
excite
a
great
degree
of
sympathy
in
a
stranger
who
had
been
partially
informed
of
her
origin
when
comparing
her
present
situation
with
what
it
probably
would
have
been
had
she
been
permitted
to
have
remained
with
her
friends
and
to
have
enjoyed
the
blessings
of
civilization
in
stature
she
is
very
short
and
considerably
under
the
middle
size
and
stands
tolerably
erect
with
her
head
bent
forward
apparently
from
her
having
for
a
long
time
been
accustomed
to
carrying
heavy
burdens
in
a
strap
placed
across
her
forehead
her
complexion
is
very
white
for
a
woman
of
her
age
and
although
the
wrinkles
of
fourscore
years
are
deeply
indented
in
her
cheeks
yet
the
crimson
of
youth
is
distinctly
visible
her
eyes
are
light
blue
a
little
faded
by
age
and
naturally
brilliant
and
sparkling
her
sight
is
quite
dim
though
she
is
able
to
perform
her
necessary
labor
without
the
assistance
of
glasses
her
cheek
bones
are
high
and
rather
prominent
and
her
front
teeth
in
the
lower
jaw
are
sound
and
good
when
she
looks
up
and
is
engaged
in
conversation
her
countenance
is
very
expressive
but
from
her
long
residence
with
the
indians
she
has
acquired
the
habit
of
peeping
from
under
as
they
do
with
the
head
inclined
downwards
formerly
her
hair
was
of
a
light
chestnut
brown
it
is
now
quite
grey
a
little
curled
of
middling
length
and
tied
in
a
bunch
behind
she
informed
me
that
she
had
never
worn
a
cap
nor
a
comb
she
speaks
english
plainly
and
distinctly
with
a
little
of
the
irish
emphasis
and
has
the
use
of
words
so
well
as
to
render
herself
intelligible
on
any
subject
with
which
she
is
acquainted
her
recollection
and
memory
exceeded
my
expectation
it
can
not
be
reasonably
supposed
that
a
person
of
her
age
has
kept
the
events
of
seventy
years
in
so
complete
a
chain
as
to
be
able
to
assign
to
each
its
proper
time
and
place
she
however
made
her
recital
with
as
few
obvious
mistakes
as
might
be
found
in
that
of
a
person
of
fifty
she
walks
with
a
quick
step
without
a
staff
and
i
was
informed
by
clute
that
she
could
yet
cross
a
stream
on
a
log
or
pole
as
steadily
as
any
other
person
her
passions
are
easily
excited
at
a
number
of
periods
in
her
narration
tears
trickled
down
her
grief
worn
cheek
and
at
the
same
time
a
rising
sigh
would
stop
her
utterance
industry
is
a
virtue
which
she
has
uniformly
practised
from
the
day
of
her
adoption
to
the
present
she
pounds
her
samp
cooks
for
herself
gathers
and
chops
wood
feeds
her
cattle
and
poultry
and
performs
other
laborious
services
last
season
she
planted
tended
and
gathered
corn
in
short
she
is
always
busy
her
dress
at
the
time
i
saw
her
was
made
and
worn
after
the
indian
fashion
and
consisted
of
a
shirt
short
gown
petticoat
stockings
moccasins
a
blanket
and
a
bonnet
the
shirt
was
of
cotton
and
made
at
the
top
as
i
was
informed
like
a
man
without
collar
or
sleeves
was
open
before
and
extended
down
about
midway
of
the
the
petticoat
was
a
piece
of
broadcloth
with
the
list
at
the
top
and
bottom
and
the
ends
sewed
together
this
was
tied
on
by
a
string
that
was
passed
over
it
and
around
the
waist
in
such
a
manner
as
to
let
the
bottom
of
the
petticoat
down
half
way
between
the
knee
and
ankle
and
leave
of
a
yard
at
the
top
to
be
turned
down
over
the
string
the
bottom
of
the
shift
coming
a
little
below
and
on
the
outside
of
the
top
of
the
fold
so
as
to
leave
the
list
and
two
or
three
inches
of
the
cloth
uncovered
the
stockings
were
of
blue
broadcloth
tied
or
pinned
on
which
reached
from
the
knees
into
the
mouth
of
the
around
her
toes
only
she
had
some
rags
and
over
these
her
buckskin
moccasins
her
gown
was
of
undressed
flannel
colored
brown
it
was
made
in
old
yankee
style
with
long
sleeves
covered
the
top
of
the
hips
and
was
tied
before
in
two
places
with
strings
of
deer
skin
over
all
this
she
wore
an
indian
blanket
on
her
head
she
wore
a
piece
of
old
brown
woollen
cloth
made
somewhat
like
a
sun
bonnet
such
was
the
dress
that
this
woman
was
contented
to
wear
and
habit
had
rendered
it
convenient
and
comfortable
she
wore
it
not
as
a
matter
of
t
necessity
but
from
choice
for
it
will
be
seen
in
the
sequel
that
her
property
is
sufficient
to
enable
her
to
dress
in
the
best
fashion
and
to
allow
her
every
comfort
of
life
her
house
in
which
she
lives
is
by
feet
built
of
square
timber
with
a
shingled
roof
and
a
framed
stoop
in
the
centre
of
the
house
is
a
chimney
of
stones
and
sticks
in
which
there
are
two
fire
places
she
has
a
good
framed
barn
by
well
filled
and
owns
a
fine
stock
of
cattle
and
horses
besides
the
buildings
above
mentioned
she
owns
a
number
of
houses
that
are
occupied
by
tenants
who
work
her
flats
upon
shares
her
dwelling
is
about
one
hundred
rods
north
of
the
great
slide
a
curiosity
that
will
be
described
in
its
proper
place
on
the
west
side
of
the
genesee
river
jemison
appeared
sensible
of
her
ignorance
of
the
manners
of
the
white
people
and
for
that
reason
was
not
familiar
except
with
those
with
whom
she
was
intimately
acquainted
in
fact
she
was
to
appearance
so
jealous
of
her
rights
or
that
she
should
say
something
that
would
be
injurious
to
herself
or
family
that
if
clute
had
not
been
present
we
should
have
been
unable
to
have
obtained
her
history
she
however
soon
became
free
and
unembarrassed
in
her
conversation
and
spoke
with
degree
of
mildness
candor
and
simplicity
that
is
calculated
to
remove
all
doubts
as
to
the
veracity
of
the
speaker
the
vices
of
the
indians
she
appeared
disposed
not
to
aggravate
and
seemed
to
take
pride
in
extoling
their
virtues
a
kind
of
family
pride
inclined
her
to
withhold
whatever
would
blot
the
character
of
her
descendants
and
perhaps
induced
her
to
keep
back
many
things
that
would
have
been
interesting
for
the
life
of
her
last
husband
we
are
indebted
to
her
cousin
george
jemison
to
whom
she
referred
us
for
information
on
that
subject
generally
the
thoughts
of
his
deeds
probably
chilled
her
old
heart
and
made
her
dread
to
rehearse
them
and
at
the
same
time
she
well
knew
they
were
no
secret
for
she
had
frequently
heard
him
relate
the
whole
not
only
to
her
cousin
but
to
others
before
she
left
us
she
was
very
sociable
and
she
resumed
her
naturally
pleasant
countenance
enlivened
with
a
smile
her
neighbors
speak
of
her
as
possessing
one
of
the
happiest
tempers
and
disposition
and
give
her
the
name
of
never
having
done
a
censurable
act
to
their
knowledge
her
habits
are
those
of
the
indians
she
sleeps
on
skins
without
a
bedstead
sits
upon
the
floor
or
on
a
bench
and
holds
her
victuals
on
her
lap
or
in
her
hands
her
ideas
of
religion
correspond
in
every
respect
with
those
of
the
great
mass
of
the
senecas
she
applauds
virtue
and
despises
vice
she
believes
in
a
future
state
in
which
the
good
will
be
happy
and
the
bad
miserable
and
that
the
acquisition
of
that
happiness
depends
primarily
upon
human
volition
and
the
consequent
good
deeds
of
the
happy
recipient
of
blessedness
the
doctrines
taught
in
the
christian
religion
she
is
a
stranger
to
her
daughters
are
said
to
be
active
and
enterprizing
women
and
her
grandsons
who
arrived
to
manhood
are
considered
able
decent
and
respectable
men
in
their
tribe
having
in
this
cursory
manner
introduced
the
subject
of
the
following
pages
i
proceed
to
the
narration
of
a
life
that
has
been
viewed
with
attention
for
a
great
number
of
years
by
a
few
and
which
will
be
read
by
the
public

mixed

and

life
of
mary
jemison
chapter
nativity
of
her
their
removal
to
her
parents
settle
in
omen
of
her
captivity
although
i
may
have
frequently
heard
the
history
of
my
ancestry
my
recollection
is
too
imperfect
to
enable
me
to
trace
it
further
back
than
my
father
and
mother
whom
i
have
often
heard
mention
the
families
from
whence
they
originated
as
having
possessed
wealth
and
honorable
stations
under
the
government
of
the
country
in
which
they
resided
on
the
account
of
the
great
length
of
time
that
has
elapsed
since
i
was
separated
from
my
parents
and
friends
and
having
heard
the
story
of
their
nativity
only
in
the
days
of
my
childhood
i
am
not
able
to
state
positively
which
of
the
two
countries
ireland
or
scotland
was
the
land
of
my
parents
birth
and
education
it
however
is
my
impression
that
they
were
born
and
brought
up
in
ireland
my
father
name
was
thomas
jemison
and
my
mother
before
her
marriage
with
him
was
jane
erwin
their
affection
for
each
other
was
mutual
and
of
that
happy
kind
which
tends
directly
to
sweeten
the
cup
of
life
to
render
connubial
sorrows
lighter
to
assuage
every
discontentment
and
to
promote
not
only
their
own
comfort
but
that
of
all
who
come
within
the
circle
of
their
acquaintance
of
their
happiness
i
recollect
to
have
heard
them
speak
and
the
remembrance
i
yet
retain
of
their
mildness
and
perfect
agreement
in
the
government
of
their
children
together
with
their
mutual
attention
to
our
common
education
manners
religious
instruction
and
wants
renders
it
a
fact
in
my
mind
that
they
were
ornaments
to
the
married
state
and
examples
of
connubial
love
worthy
of
imitation
after
my
remembrance
they
were
strict
observers
of
religious
duties
for
it
was
the
daily
practice
of
my
father
morning
and
evening
to
attend
in
his
family
to
the
worship
of
god
resolved
to
leave
the
land
of
their
nativity
they
removed
from
their
residence
to
a
port
in
ireland
where
they
lived
but
a
short
time
before
they
set
sail
for
this
country
in
the
year
or
on
board
the
ship
mary
william
bound
to
philadelphia
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
the
intestine
divisions
civil
wars
and
ecclesiastical
rigidity
and
domination
that
prevailed
those
days
were
the
causes
of
their
leaving
their
mother
country
and
a
home
in
the
american
wilderness
under
the
mild
and
temperate
government
of
the
descendants
of
william
penn
where
without
fear
they
might
worship
god
and
perform
their
usual
avocations
in
europe
my
parents
had
two
sons
and
one
daughter
whose
names
were
john
thomas
and
betsey
with
whom
after
having
put
their
effects
on
board
they
embarked
leaving
a
large
connexion
of
relatives
and
friends
under
all
those
painful
sensations
which
are
only
felt
when
kindred
souls
give
the
parting
hand
and
last
farewell
to
those
to
whom
they
are
endeared
by
every
friendly
tie
in
the
course
of
their
voyage
i
was
born
to
be
the
sport
of
fortune
and
almost
an
outcast
to
civil
society
to
stem
the
current
of
adversity
through
a
long
chain
of
vicissitudes
unsupported
by
the
advice
of
tender
parents
or
the
hand
of
an
affectionate
friend
and
even
without
the
enjoyment
from
others
of
any
of
those
tender
sympathies
that
are
adapted
to
the
sweetening
of
society
except
such
as
naturally
flow
from
uncultivated
minds
that
have
been
calloused
by
ferocity
excepting
my
birth
nothing
remarkable
occurred
to
my
parents
on
their
passage
and
they
were
safely
landed
at
philadelphia
my
father
being
fond
of
rural
life
and
having
been
bred
to
agricultural
pursuits
soon
left
the
city
and
removed
his
family
to
the
then
frontier
settlements
of
pennsylvania
to
a
tract
of
excellent
land
lying
on
marsh
creek
at
that
place
he
cleared
a
large
farm
and
for
seven
or
eight
years
enjoyed
the
fruits
of
his
industry
peace
attended
their
labors
and
they
had
nothing
to
alarm
them
save
the
midnight
howl
of
the
prowling
wolf
or
the
terrifying
shriek
of
the
ferocious
panther
as
they
occasionally
visited
their
improvements
to
take
a
lamb
or
a
calf
to
satisfy
their
hunger
during
this
period
my
mother
had
two
sons
between
whose
ages
there
was
a
difference
of
about
three
years
the
oldest
was
named
matthew
and
the
other
robert
health
presided
on
every
countenance
and
vigor
and
strength
characterized
every
exertion
our
mansion
was
a
little
paradise
the
morning
of
my
childish
happy
days
will
ever
stand
fresh
in
my
remembrance
notwithstanding
the
many
severe
trials
through
which
i
have
passed
in
arriving
at
my
present
situation
at
so
advanced
an
age
even
at
this
remote
period
the
recollection
of
my
pleasant
home
at
my
father
of
my
parents
of
my
brothers
and
sister
and
of
the
manner
in
which
i
was
deprived
of
them
all
at
once
affects
me
so
powerfully
that
i
am
almost
overwhelmed
with
grief
that
is
seemingly
insupportable
frequently
i
dream
of
those
happy
days
but
alas
they
are
gone
they
have
left
me
to
be
carried
through
a
long
life
dependent
for
the
little
pleasures
of
nearly
seventy
years
upon
the
tender
mercies
of
the
indians
in
the
spring
of
and
through
the
succeeding
seasons
the
stories
of
indian
barbarities
inflicted
upon
the
whites
in
those
days
frequently
excited
in
my
parents
the
most
serious
alarm
for
our
safety
the
next
year
the
storm
gathered
faster
many
murders
were
committed
and
many
captives
were
exposed
to
meet
death
in
its
most
frightful
form
by
having
their
bodies
stuck
full
of
pine
splinters
which
were
immediately
set
on
fire
while
their
tormentors
exulting
in
their
distress
would
rejoice
at
their
agony
in
an
army
for
the
protection
of
the
settlers
and
to
drive
back
the
french
and
indians
was
raised
from
the
militia
of
the
colonial
governments
and
placed
secondarily
under
the
command
of
george
washington
in
that
army
i
had
an
uncle
whose
name
was
john
jemison
who
was
killed
at
the
battle
at
the
great
meadow
or
fort
necessity
his
wife
had
died
some
time
before
this
and
left
a
young
child
which
my
mother
nursed
in
the
most
tender
manner
till
its
mother
sister
took
it
away
a
few
months
after
my
uncle
death
the
french
and
indians
after
the
surrender
of
fort
necessity
by
washington
which
happened
the
same
season
and
soon
after
his
victory
over
them
at
that
place
grew
more
and
more
terrible
the
death
of
the
whites
and
plundering
and
burning
their
property
was
apparently
their
only
object
but
as
yet
we
had
not
heard
the
nor
seen
the
smoke
of
a
dwelling
that
had
been
lit
by
an
indian
hand
the
return
of
a
day
found
us
unmolested
and
though
we
knew
that
the
enemy
was
at
no
great
distance
from
us
my
father
concluded
that
he
would
continue
to
occupy
his
land
another
season
expecting
probably
from
the
great
exertions
which
the
government
was
then
making
that
as
soon
as
the
troops
could
commence
their
operations
in
the
spring
the
enemy
would
be
conquered
and
compelled
to
agree
to
a
treaty
of
peace
in
the
preceding
autumn
my
father
either
moved
to
another
part
of
his
farm
or
to
another
neighborhood
a
short
distance
from
our
former
abode
i
well
recollect
moving
and
that
the
barn
that
was
on
the
place
we
moved
to
was
built
of
logs
though
the
house
was
a
good
one
the
winter
of
was
as
mild
as
a
common
fall
season
and
the
spring
presented
a
pleasant
seed
time
and
indicated
a
plenteous
harvest
my
father
with
the
assistance
of
his
oldest
sons
repaired
his
farm
as
usual
and
was
daily
preparing
the
soil
for
the
reception
of
the
seed
his
cattle
and
sheep
were
numerous
and
according
to
the
best
idea
of
wealth
that
i
can
now
form
he
was
wealthy
but
alas
how
transitory
are
all
human
affairs
how
fleeting
are
riches
how
brittle
the
invisible
thread
on
which
all
earthly
comforts
are
suspended
peace
in
a
moment
can
take
an
immeasurable
flight
health
can
lose
its
rosy
cheeks
and
life
will
vanish
like
a
vapor
at
the
appearance
of
the
sun
in
one
fatal
day
our
prospects
were
all
blasted
and
death
by
cruel
hands
inflicted
upon
almost
the
whole
of
the
family
on
a
pleasant
day
in
the
spring
of
when
my
father
was
sowing
and
my
brothers
driving
the
teams
i
was
sent
to
a
house
a
distance
of
perhaps
a
mile
to
procure
a
horse
and
return
with
it
the
next
morning
i
went
as
i
was
directed
i
was
out
of
the
house
in
the
beginning
of
the
evening
and
saw
a
sheet
wide
spread
approaching
towards
me
in
which
i
was
caught
as
i
have
ever
since
believed
and
deprived
of
my
senses
the
family
soon
found
me
on
the
ground
almost
lifeless
as
they
said
took
me
in
and
made
use
of
every
remedy
in
their
power
for
my
recovery
but
without
effect
till
when
my
senses
returned
and
i
soon
found
myself
in
good
health
so
that
i
went
home
with
the
horse
very
early
in
the
morning
the
appearance
of
that
sheet
i
have
ever
considered
as
a
forerunner
of
the
melancholy
catastrophe
that
so
soon
afterwards
happened
to
our
family
and
my
being
caught
in
it
i
believe
was
ominous
of
my
preservation
from
death
at
the
time
we
were
captured

pitt
my
education
had
received
as
much
attention
from
my
parents
as
their
situation
in
a
new
country
would
admit
i
had
been
at
school
some
where
i
learned
to
read
in
a
book
that
was
about
half
as
large
as
a
bible
and
in
the
bible
i
had
read
a
little
i
had
also
learned
the
catechism
which
i
used
frequently
to
repeat
to
my
parents
and
every
night
before
i
went
to
bed
i
was
obliged
to
stand
up
before
my
mother
and
repeat
some
words
that
i
suppose
was
a
prayer
my
reading
catechism
and
prayers
i
have
long
since
forgotten
though
for
a
number
of
the
first
years
that
i
lived
with
the
indians
i
repeated
the
prayers
as
often
as
i
had
an
opportunity
after
the
revolutionary
war
i
remembered
the
names
of
some
of
the
letters
when
i
saw
them
but
have
never
read
a
word
since
i
was
taken
prisoner
it
is
but
a
few
years
since
a
missionary
kindly
gave
me
a
bible
which
i
am
very
fond
of
hearing
my
neighbors
read
to
me
and
should
be
pleased
to
learn
to
read
it
myself
but
my
sight
has
been
for
a
number
of
years
so
dim
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
distinguish
one
letter
from
another
as
i
before
observed
i
got
home
with
the
horse
very
early
in
the
morning
where
i
found
a
man
that
lived
in
our
neighborhood
and
his
who
had
three
children
one
son
and
two
daughters
i
soon
learned
that
they
had
come
there
to
live
a
short
time
but
for
what
purpose
i
can
not
say
the
woman
husband
however
was
at
that
time
in
washington
army
fighting
for
his
country
and
as
her
had
a
house
she
had
lived
with
him
in
his
absence
their
names
i
have
forgotten
immediately
after
i
got
home
the
man
took
the
horse
to
go
to
his
house
after
a
bag
of
grain
and
took
his
gun
in
his
hand
for
the
purpose
of
killing
game
if
he
should
chance
to
see
our
family
as
usual
was
busily
employed
about
their
common
business
father
was
shaving
an
at
the
side
of
the
house
mother
was
making
preparations
for
breakfast
my
two
oldest
brothers
were
at
work
near
the
barn
and
the
little
ones
with
myself
and
the
woman
and
her
three
children
were
in
the
house
breakfast
was
not
yet
ready
when
we
were
alarmed
by
the
discharge
of
a
number
of
guns
that
seemed
to
be
near
mother
and
the
women
before
mentioned
almost
fainted
at
the
report
and
every
one
trembled
with
fear
on
opening
the
door
the
man
and
horse
lay
dead
near
the
house
having
just
been
shot
by
the
indians
i
was
afterwards
informed
that
the
indians
discovered
him
at
his
own
house
with
his
gun
and
pursued
him
to
father
where
they
shot
him
as
i
have
related
they
first
secured
my
father
and
then
rushed
into
the
house
and
without
the
least
resistance
made
prisoners
of
my
mother
robert
matthew
betsey
the
woman
and
her
three
children
and
myself
and
then
commenced
plundering
my
two
brothers
thomas
and
john
being
at
the
barn
escaped
and
went
to
virginia
where
my
grandfather
erwin
then
lived
as
i
was
informed
by
a
fields
who
was
at
my
house
about
the
close
of
the
revolutionary
war
the
party
that
took
us
consisted
of
six
indians
and
four
frenchmen
who
immediately
commenced
plundering
as
i
just
observed
and
took
what
they
considered
most
valuable
consisting
principally
of
bread
meal
and
meat
having
taken
as
much
provision
as
they
could
carry
they
set
out
with
their
prisoners
in
great
haste
for
fear
of
detection
and
soon
entered
the
woods
on
our
march
that
day
an
indian
went
behind
us
with
a
whip
with
which
he
frequently
lashed
the
children
to
make
them
keep
up
in
this
manner
we
travelled
till
dark
without
a
mouthful
of
food
or
a
drop
of
water
although
we
had
not
eaten
since
the
night
before
whenever
the
little
children
cried
for
water
the
indians
would
make
them
drink
urine
or
go
thirsty
at
night
they
encamped
in
the
woods
without
fire
and
without
shelter
where
we
were
watched
with
the
greatest
vigilance
extremely
fatigued
and
very
hungry
we
were
compelled
to
lie
upon
the
ground
supperless
and
without
a
drop
of
water
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
our
appetites
as
in
the
day
time
so
the
little
ones
were
made
to
drink
urine
in
the
night
if
they
cried
for
water
fatigue
alone
brought
us
a
little
sleep
for
the
refreshment
of
our
weary
limbs
and
at
the
dawn
of
day
we
were
again
started
on
our
march
in
the
same
order
that
we
had
proceeded
on
the
day
before
about
sunrise
we
were
halted
and
the
indians
gave
us
a
full
breakfast
of
provision
that
they
had
brought
from
my
father
house
each
of
us
being
very
hungry
partook
of
this
bounty
of
the
indians
except
father
who
was
so
much
overcome
with
his
situation
so
much
exhausted
by
anxiety
and
grief
that
silent
despair
seemed
fastened
upon
his
countenance
and
he
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
refresh
his
sinking
nature
by
the
use
of
a
morsel
of
food
our
repast
being
finished
we
again
resumed
our
march
and
before
noon
passed
a
small
fort
that
i
heard
my
father
say
was
called
fort
canagojigge
that
was
the
only
time
that
i
heard
him
speak
from
the
time
we
were
taken
till
we
were
finally
separated
the
following
night
towards
evening
we
arrived
at
the
border
of
a
dark
and
dismal
swamp
which
was
covered
with
small
hemlocks
or
some
other
evergreen
and
other
bushes
into
which
we
were
conducted
and
having
gone
a
short
distance
we
stopped
to
encamp
for
the
night
here
we
had
some
bread
and
meat
for
supper
but
the
dreariness
of
our
situation
together
with
the
uncertainty
under
which
we
all
labored
as
to
our
future
destiny
almost
deprived
us
of
the
sense
of
hunger
and
destroyed
our
relish
for
food
mother
from
the
time
we
were
taken
had
manifested
a
great
degree
of
fortitude
and
encouraged
us
to
support
our
troubles
without
complaining
and
by
her
conversation
seemed
to
make
the
distance
and
time
shorter
and
the
way
more
smooth
but
father
lost
all
his
ambition
in
the
beginning
of
our
trouble
and
continued
apparently
lost
to
every
care
absorbed
in
melancholy
here
as
before
she
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
our
eating
and
we
obeyed
her
but
it
was
done
with
heavy
hearts
as
soon
as
i
had
finished
my
supper
an
indian
took
off
my
shoes
and
stockings
and
put
a
pair
of
moccasins
on
my
feet
which
my
mother
observed
and
believing
that
they
would
spare
my
life
even
if
they
should
destroy
the
other
captives
addressed
me
as
near
as
i
can
remember
in
the
following
words
my
dear
little
mary
i
fear
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
we
must
be
parted
forever
your
life
my
child
i
think
will
be
spared
but
we
shall
probably
be
tomahawked
here
in
this
lonesome
place
by
the
indians
o
how
can
i
part
with
you
my
darling
what
will
become
of
my
sweet
little
mary
oh
how
can
i
think
of
your
being
continued
in
captivity
without
a
hope
of
your
being
rescued
o
that
death
had
snatched
you
from
my
embraces
in
your
infancy
the
pain
of
parting
then
would
have
been
pleasing
to
what
it
now
is
and
i
should
have
seen
the
end
of
your
troubles
alas
my
dear
my
heart
bleeds
at
the
thoughts
of
what
awaits
you
but
if
you
leave
us
remember
my
child
your
own
name
and
the
name
of
your
father
and
mother
be
careful
and
not
forget
your
english
tongue
if
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
to
get
away
from
the
indians
do
try
to
escape
for
if
you
do
they
will
find
and
destroy
you
forget
my
little
daughter
the
prayers
that
i
have
learned
you
say
them
often
be
a
good
child
and
god
will
bless
you
may
god
bless
you
my
child
and
make
you
comfortable
and
happy
during
this
time
the
indians
stripped
the
shoes
and
stockings
from
the
little
boy
that
belonged
to
the
woman
who
was
taken
with
us
and
put
moccasins
on
his
feet
as
they
had
done
before
on
mine
i
was
crying
an
indian
took
the
little
boy
and
myself
by
the
hand
to
lead
us
off
from
the
company
when
my
mother
exclaimed
do
cry
mary
do
cry
my
child
god
will
bless
you
farewell
farewell
the
indian
led
us
some
distance
into
the
bushes
or
woods
and
there
lay
down
with
us
to
spend
the
night
the
recollection
of
parting
with
my
tender
mother
kept
me
awake
while
the
tears
constantly
flowed
from
my
eyes
a
number
of
times
in
the
night
the
little
boy
begged
of
me
earnestly
to
run
away
with
him
and
get
clear
of
the
indians
but
remembering
the
advice
i
had
so
lately
received
and
knowing
the
dangers
to
which
we
should
be
exposed
in
travelling
without
a
path
and
without
a
guide
through
a
wilderness
unknown
to
us
i
told
him
that
i
would
not
go
and
persuaded
him
to
lie
still
till
morning
early
the
next
morning
the
indians
and
frenchmen
that
we
had
left
the
night
before
came
to
us
but
our
friends
were
left
behind
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
form
a
correct
idea
of
what
my
feelings
were
at
the
sight
of
those
savages
whom
i
supposed
had
murdered
my
parents
and
brothers
sister
and
friends
and
left
them
in
the
swamp
to
be
devoured
by
wild
beasts
but
what
could
i
do
a
poor
little
defenceless
girl
without
the
power
or
means
of
escaping
without
a
home
to
go
to
even
if
i
could
be
liberated
without
a
knowledge
of
the
direction
or
distance
to
my
former
place
of
residence
and
without
a
living
friend
to
whom
to
fly
for
protection
i
felt
a
kind
of
horror
anxiety
and
dread
that
to
me
seemed
insupportable
i
durst
not
cry
i
durst
not
complain
and
to
inquire
of
them
the
fate
of
my
friends
even
if
i
could
have
mustered
resolution
was
beyond
my
ability
as
i
could
not
speak
their
language
nor
they
understand
mine
my
only
relief
was
in
silent
stifled
sobs
my
suspicions
as
to
the
fate
of
my
parents
proved
too
true
for
soon
after
i
left
them
they
were
killed
and
scalped
together
with
robert
matthew
betsey
and
the
woman
and
her
two
children
and
mangled
in
the
most
shocking
manner
having
given
the
little
boy
and
myself
some
bread
and
meat
for
breakfast
they
led
us
on
as
fast
as
we
could
travel
and
one
of
them
went
behind
and
with
a
long
staff
picked
up
all
the
grass
and
weeds
that
we
trailed
down
by
going
over
them
by
taking
that
precaution
they
avoided
detection
for
each
weed
was
so
nicely
placed
in
its
natural
position
that
no
one
would
have
suspected
that
we
had
passed
that
way
it
is
the
custom
of
indians
when
scouting
or
on
private
expeditions
to
step
carefully
and
where
no
impression
of
their
feet
can
be
left
shunning
wet
or
muddy
ground
they
seldom
take
hold
of
a
bush
or
limb
and
never
break
one
and
by
observing
those
precautions
and
that
of
setting
up
the
weeds
and
grass
which
they
necessarily
lop
they
completely
elude
the
sagacity
of
their
pursuers
and
escape
that
punishment
which
they
are
conscious
they
merit
from
the
hand
of
justice
after
a
hard
day
march
we
encamped
in
a
thicket
where
the
indians
made
a
shelter
of
boughs
and
then
built
a
good
fire
to
warm
and
dry
our
benumbed
limbs
and
clothing
for
it
had
rained
some
through
the
day
here
we
were
again
fed
as
before
when
the
indians
had
finished
their
supper
they
took
from
their
baggage
a
number
of
scalps
and
went
about
preparing
them
for
the
market
or
to
keep
without
spoiling
by
straining
them
over
small
hoops
which
they
prepared
for
that
purpose
and
then
drying
and
scraping
them
by
the
fire
having
put
the
scalps
yet
wet
and
bloody
upon
the
hoops
and
stretched
them
to
their
full
extent
they
held
them
to
the
fire
till
they
were
partly
dried
and
then
with
their
knives
commenced
scraping
off
the
flesh
and
in
that
way
they
continued
to
work
alternately
drying
and
scraping
them
till
they
were
dry
and
clean
that
being
done
they
combed
the
hair
in
the
neatest
manner
and
then
painted
it
and
the
edges
of
the
scalps
yet
on
the
hoops
red
those
scalps
i
knew
at
the
time
must
have
been
taken
from
our
family
by
the
color
of
the
hair
my
mother
hair
was
red
and
i
could
easily
distinguish
my
father
and
the
children
from
each
other
that
sight
was
most
appaling
yet
i
was
obliged
to
endure
it
without
complaining
in
the
course
of
the
night
they
made
me
to
understand
that
they
should
not
have
killed
the
family
if
the
whites
had
not
pursued
them
fields
whom
i
have
before
mentioned
informed
me
that
at
the
time
we
were
taken
he
lived
in
the
vicinity
of
my
father
and
that
on
hearing
of
our
captivity
the
whole
neighborhood
turned
out
in
pursuit
of
the
enemy
and
to
deliver
us
if
possible
but
that
their
efforts
were
unavailing
they
however
pursued
us
to
the
dark
swamp
where
they
found
my
father
his
family
and
companions
stripped
and
mangled
in
the
most
inhuman
manner
that
from
thence
the
march
of
the
cruel
monsters
could
not
be
traced
in
any
direction
and
that
they
returned
to
their
homes
with
the
melancholy
tidings
of
our
misfortunes
supposing
that
we
had
all
shared
in
the
massacre
the
next
morning
we
went
on
the
indian
going
behind
us
and
setting
up
the
weeds
as
on
the
day
before
at
night
we
encamped
on
the
ground
in
the
open
air
without
a
shelter
or
fire
in
the
morning
we
again
set
out
early
and
travelled
as
on
the
two
former
days
though
the
weather
was
extremely
uncomfortable
from
the
continual
falling
of
rain
and
snow
at
night
the
snow
fell
fast
and
the
indians
built
a
shelter
of
boughs
and
a
fire
where
we
rested
tolerably
dry
through
that
and
the
two
succeeding
nights
when
we
stopped
and
before
the
fire
was
kindled
i
was
so
much
fatigued
from
running
and
so
far
benumbed
by
the
wet
and
cold
that
i
expected
that
i
must
fail
and
die
before
i
could
get
warm
and
comfortable
the
fire
however
soon
restored
the
circulation
and
after
i
had
taken
my
supper
i
felt
so
that
i
rested
well
through
the
night
on
account
of
the
storm
we
were
two
days
at
that
place
on
one
of
those
days
a
party
consisting
of
six
indians
who
had
been
to
the
frontier
settlements
came
to
where
we
were
and
brought
with
them
one
prisoner
a
young
white
man
who
was
very
tired
and
dejected
his
name
i
have
forgotten
misery
certainly
loves
company
i
was
extremely
glad
to
see
him
though
i
knew
from
his
appearance
that
his
situation
was
as
deplorable
as
mine
and
that
he
could
afford
me
no
kind
of
assistance
in
the
afternoon
the
indians
killed
a
deer
which
they
dressed
and
then
roasted
it
whole
which
made
them
a
full
meal
we
were
each
allowed
a
share
of
their
venison
and
some
bread
so
that
we
made
a
good
meal
also
having
spent
three
nights
and
two
days
at
that
place
and
the
storm
having
ceased
early
in
the
morning
the
whole
company
consisting
of
twelve
indians
four
frenchmen
the
young
man
the
little
boy
and
myself
moved
on
at
a
moderate
pace
without
an
indian
behind
us
to
deceive
our
pursuers
in
the
afternoon
we
came
in
sight
of
fort
pitt
as
it
is
now
called
where
we
were
halted
while
the
indians
performed
some
customs
upon
their
prisoners
which
they
deemed
necessary
that
fort
was
then
occupied
by
the
french
and
indians
and
was
called
fort
du
quesne
it
stood
at
the
junction
of
the
monongahela
which
is
said
to
signify
in
some
of
the
indian
languages
the
footnote
navigator
and
the
alleghany
footnote
the
word
alleghenny
was
derived
from
an
ancient
race
of
indians
called
tallegawe
the
delaware
indians
instead
of
saying
alleghenny
say
allegawe
or
allegawenink
p
rivers
where
the
ohio
river
begins
to
take
its
name
the
word
signifies
bloody
at
the
place
where
we
halted
the
indians
combed
the
hair
of
the
young
man
the
boy
and
myself
and
then
painted
our
faces
and
hair
red
in
the
finest
indian
style
we
were
then
conducted
into
the
fort
where
we
received
a
little
bread
and
were
then
shut
up
and
left
to
tarry
alone

the
night

the
night
was
spent
in
gloomy
forebodings
what
the
result
of
our
captivity
would
be
it
was
out
of
our
power
to
determine
or
even
at
times
we
could
almost
realize
the
approach
of
our
masters
to
butcher
and
scalp
us
again
we
could
nearly
see
the
pile
of
wood
kindled
on
which
we
were
to
be
roasted
and
then
we
would
imagine
ourselves
at
liberty
alone
and
defenceless
in
the
forest
surrounded
by
wild
beasts
that
were
ready
to
devour
us
the
anxiety
of
our
minds
drove
sleep
from
our
eyelids
and
it
was
with
a
dreadful
hope
and
painful
impatience
that
we
waited
for
the
morning
to
determine
our
fate
the
morning
at
length
arrived
and
our
masters
came
early
and
let
us
out
of
the
house
and
gave
the
young
man
and
boy
to
the
french
who
immediately
took
them
away
their
fate
i
never
learned
as
i
have
not
seen
nor
heard
of
them
since
i
was
now
left
alone
in
the
fort
deprived
of
my
former
companions
and
of
every
thing
that
was
near
or
dear
to
me
but
life
but
it
was
not
long
before
i
was
in
some
measure
relieved
by
the
appearance
of
two
pleasant
looking
squaws
of
the
seneca
tribe
who
came
and
examined
me
attentively
for
a
short
time
and
then
went
out
after
a
few
minutes
absence
they
returned
with
my
former
masters
who
gave
me
to
them
to
dispose
of
as
they
pleased
the
indians
by
whom
i
was
taken
were
a
party
of
shawanees
if
i
remember
right
that
lived
when
at
home
a
long
distance
down
the
ohio
my
former
indian
masters
and
the
two
squaws
were
soon
ready
to
leave
the
fort
and
accordingly
embarked
the
indians
in
a
large
canoe
and
the
two
squaws
and
myself
in
a
small
one
and
went
down
the
ohio
when
we
set
off
an
indian
in
the
forward
canoe
took
the
scalps
of
my
former
friends
strung
them
on
a
pole
that
he
placed
upon
his
shoulder
and
in
that
manner
carried
them
standing
in
the
stern
of
the
canoe
directly
before
us
as
we
sailed
down
the
river
to
the
town
where
the
two
squaws
resided
on
our
way
we
passed
a
shawanee
town
where
i
saw
a
number
of
heads
arms
legs
and
other
fragments
of
the
bodies
of
some
white
people
who
had
just
been
burnt
the
parts
that
remained
were
hanging
on
a
pole
which
was
supported
at
each
end
by
a
crotch
stuck
in
the
ground
and
were
roasted
or
burnt
black
as
a
coal
the
fire
was
yet
burning
and
the
whole
appearances
afforded
a
spectacle
so
shocking
that
even
to
this
day
my
blood
almost
curdles
in
my
veins
when
i
think
of
them
at
night
we
arrived
at
a
small
seneca
indian
town
at
the
mouth
of
a
small
river
that
was
called
by
the
indians
in
the
seneca
language
footnote
that
town
according
to
the
geographical
description
given
by
jemison
must
have
stood
at
the
mouth
of
indian
cross
creek
which
is
about
miles
by
water
below
pittsburgh
or
at
the
mouth
of
indian
short
creek
miles
below
pittsburgh
where
the
town
of
warren
now
stands
but
at
which
of
those
places
i
am
unable
to
determine
where
the
two
squaws
to
whom
i
belonged
resided
there
we
landed
and
the
indians
went
on
which
was
the
last
i
ever
saw
of
them
having
made
fast
to
the
shore
the
squaws
left
me
in
the
canoe
while
they
went
to
their
wigwam
or
house
in
the
town
and
returned
with
a
suit
of
indian
clothing
all
new
and
very
clean
and
nice
my
clothes
though
whole
and
good
when
i
was
taken
were
now
torn
in
pieces
so
that
i
was
almost
naked
they
first
undressed
me
and
threw
my
rags
into
the
river
then
washed
me
clean
and
dressed
me
in
the
new
suit
they
had
just
brought
in
complete
indian
style
and
then
led
me
home
and
seated
me
in
the
center
of
their
wigwam
i
had
been
in
that
situation
but
a
few
minutes
before
all
the
squaws
in
the
town
came
in
to
see
me
i
was
soon
surrounded
by
them
and
they
immediately
set
up
a
most
dismal
howling
crying
bitterly
and
wringing
their
hands
in
all
the
agonies
of
grief
for
a
deceased
relative
their
tears
flowed
freely
and
they
exhibited
all
the
signs
of
real
mourning
at
the
commencement
of
this
scene
one
of
their
number
began
in
a
voice
somewhat
between
speaking
and
singing
to
recite
some
words
to
the
following
purport
and
continued
the
recitation
till
the
ceremony
was
ended
the
company
at
the
same
time
varying
the
appearance
of
their
countenances
gestures
and
tone
of
voice
so
as
to
correspond
with
the
sentiments
expressed
by
their
leader
oh
our
brother
alas
he
is
dead
he
has
gone
he
will
never
return
friendless
he
died
on
the
field
of
the
slain
where
his
bones
are
yet
lying
unburied
oh
who
will
not
mourn
his
sad
fate
no
tears
dropped
around
him
oh
no
no
tears
of
his
sisters
were
there
he
fell
in
his
prime
when
his
arm
was
most
needed
to
keep
us
from
danger
alas
he
has
gone
and
left
us
in
sorrow
his
loss
to
bewail
oh
where
is
his
spirit
his
spirit
went
naked
and
hungry
it
wanders
and
thirsty
and
wounded
it
groans
to
return
oh
helpless
and
wretched
our
brother
has
gone
no
blanket
nor
food
to
nourish
and
warm
him
nor
candles
to
light
him
nor
weapons
of
war
oh
none
of
those
comforts
had
he
but
well
we
remember
his
deeds
the
deer
he
could
take
on
the
chase
the
panther
shrunk
back
at
the
sight
of
his
strength
his
enemies
fell
at
his
feet
he
was
brave
and
courageous
in
war
as
the
fawn
was
harmless
his
friendship
was
ardent
his
temper
was
gentle
his
pity
was
great
oh
our
friend
our
companion
is
dead
our
brother
your
brother
alas
he
is
gone
but
why
do
we
grieve
for
his
loss
in
the
strength
of
a
warrior
undaunted
he
left
us
to
fight
by
the
side
of
the
chiefs
his
was
shrill
his
rifle
well
aimed
laid
his
enemies
low
his
tomahawk
drank
of
their
blood
and
his
knife
flayed
their
scalps
while
yet
covered
with
gore
and
why
do
we
mourn
though
he
fell
on
the
field
of
the
slain
with
glory
he
fell
and
his
spirit
went
up
to
the
land
of
his
fathers
in
war
then
why
do
we
mourn
with
transports
of
joy
they
received
him
and
fed
him
and
clothed
him
and
welcomed
him
there
oh
friends
he
is
happy
then
dry
up
your
tears
his
spirit
has
seen
our
distress
and
sent
us
a
helper
whom
with
pleasure
we
greet
dickewamis
has
come
then
let
us
receive
her
with
joy
she
is
handsome
and
pleasant
oh
she
is
our
sister
and
gladly
we
welcome
her
here
in
the
place
of
our
brother
she
stands
in
our
tribe
with
care
we
will
guard
her
from
trouble
and
may
she
be
happy
till
her
spirit
shall
leave
us
in
the
course
of
that
ceremony
from
mourning
they
became
serene
joy
sparkled
in
their
countenances
and
they
seemed
to
rejoice
over
me
as
over
a
long
lost
child
i
was
made
welcome
amongst
them
as
a
sister
to
the
two
squaws
before
mentioned
and
was
called
dickewamis
which
being
interpreted
signifies
a
pretty
girl
a
handsome
girl
or
a
pleasant
good
thing
that
is
the
name
by
which
i
have
ever
since
been
called
by
the
indians
i
afterwards
learned
that
the
ceremony
i
at
that
time
passed
through
was
that
of
adoption
the
two
squaws
had
lost
a
brother
in
war
sometime
in
the
year
before
and
in
consequence
of
his
death
went
up
to
fort
pitt
on
the
day
on
which
i
arrived
there
in
order
to
receive
a
prisoner
or
an
enemy
scalp
to
supply
their
loss
it
is
a
custom
of
the
indians
when
one
of
their
number
is
slain
or
taken
prisoner
in
battle
to
give
to
the
nearest
relative
to
the
dead
or
absent
a
prisoner
if
they
have
chanced
to
take
one
and
if
not
to
give
him
the
scalp
of
an
enemy
on
the
return
of
the
indians
from
conquest
which
is
always
announced
by
peculiar
shoutings
demonstrations
of
joy
and
the
exhibition
of
some
trophy
of
victory
the
mourners
come
forward
and
make
their
claims
if
they
receive
a
prisoner
it
is
at
their
option
either
to
satiate
their
vengeance
by
taking
his
life
in
the
most
cruel
manner
they
can
conceive
of
or
to
receive
and
adopt
him
into
the
family
in
the
place
of
him
whom
they
have
lost
all
the
prisoners
that
are
taken
in
battle
and
carried
to
the
encampment
or
town
by
the
indians
are
given
to
the
bereaved
families
till
their
number
is
made
good
and
unless
the
mourners
have
but
just
received
the
news
of
their
bereavement
and
are
under
the
operation
of
a
paroxysm
of
grief
anger
and
revenge
or
unless
the
prisoner
is
very
old
sickly
or
homely
they
generally
save
him
and
treat
him
kindly
but
if
their
mental
wound
is
fresh
their
loss
so
great
that
they
deem
it
irreparable
or
if
their
prisoner
or
prisoners
do
not
meet
their
approbation
no
torture
let
it
be
ever
so
cruel
seems
sufficient
to
make
them
satisfaction
it
is
family
and
not
national
sacrifices
amongst
the
indians
that
has
given
them
an
indelible
stamp
as
barbarians
and
identified
their
character
with
the
idea
which
is
generally
formed
of
unfeeling
ferocity
and
the
most
abandoned
cruelty
it
was
my
happy
lot
to
be
accepted
for
adoption
and
at
the
time
of
the
ceremony
i
was
received
by
the
two
squaws
to
supply
the
place
of
their
brother
in
the
family
and
i
was
ever
considered
and
treated
by
them
as
a
real
sister
the
same
as
though
i
had
been
born
of
their
mother
during
my
adoption
i
sat
motionless
nearly
terrified
to
death
at
the
appearance
and
actions
of
the
company
expecting
every
moment
to
feel
their
vengeance
and
suffer
death
on
the
spot
i
was
however
happily
disappointed
when
at
the
close
of
the
ceremony
the
company
retired
and
my
sisters
went
about
employing
every
means
for
my
consolation
and
comfort
being
now
settled
and
provided
with
a
home
i
was
employed
in
nursing
the
children
and
doing
light
work
about
the
house
occasionally
i
was
sent
out
with
the
indian
hunters
when
they
went
but
a
short
distance
to
help
them
carry
their
game
my
situation
was
easy
i
had
no
particular
hardships
to
endure
but
still
the
recollection
of
my
parents
my
brothers
and
sisters
my
home
and
my
own
captivity
destroyed
my
happiness
and
made
me
constantly
solitary
lonesome
and
gloomy
my
sisters
would
not
allow
me
to
speak
english
in
their
hearing
but
remembering
the
charge
that
my
dear
mother
gave
me
at
the
time
i
left
her
whenever
i
chanced
to
be
alone
i
made
a
business
of
repeating
my
prayer
catechism
or
something
i
had
learned
in
order
that
i
might
not
forget
my
own
language
by
practising
in
that
way
i
retained
it
till
i
came
to
genesee
flats
where
i
soon
became
acquainted
with
english
people
with
whom
i
have
been
almost
daily
in
the
habit
of
conversing
my
sisters
were
diligent
in
teaching
me
their
language
and
to
their
great
satisfaction
i
soon
learned
so
that
i
could
understand
it
readily
and
speak
it
fluently
i
was
very
fortunate
in
falling
into
their
hands
for
they
were
kind
good
natured
women
peaceable
and
mild
in
their
dispositions
temperate
and
decent
in
their
habits
and
very
tender
and
gentle
towards
me
i
have
great
reason
to
respect
them
though
they
have
been
dead
a
great
number
of
years
the
town
where
they
lived
was
pleasantly
situated
on
the
ohio
at
the
mouth
of
the
shenanjee
the
land
produced
good
corn
the
woods
furnished
a
plenty
of
game
and
the
waters
abounded
with
fish
another
river
emptied
itself
into
the
ohio
directly
opposite
the
mouth
of
the
shenanjee
we
spent
the
summer
at
that
place
where
we
planted
hoed
and
harvested
a
large
crop
of
corn
of
an
excellent
quality
about
the
time
of
corn
harvest
fort
pitt
was
taken
from
the
french
by
the
english
footnote
the
above
statement
is
apparently
an
error
and
is
to
be
attributed
solely
to
the
treachery
of
the
old
lady
memory
though
she
is
confident
that
that
event
took
place
at
the
time
above
mentioned
it
is
certain
that
fort
pitt
was
not
evacuated
by
the
french
and
given
up
to
the
english
till
sometime
in
november
it
is
possible
however
that
an
armistice
was
agreed
upon
and
that
for
a
time
between
the
spring
of
and
both
nations
visited
that
post
without
fear
of
molestation
as
the
succeeding
part
of
the
narrative
corresponds
with
the
true
historical
chain
of
events
the
public
will
overlook
this
circumstance
which
appears
unsupported
by
history
author
the
corn
being
harvested
the
indians
took
it
on
horses
and
in
canoes
and
proceeded
down
the
ohio
occasionally
stopping
to
hunt
a
few
days
till
we
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
sciota
river
where
they
established
their
winter
quarters
and
continued
hunting
till
the
ensuing
spring
in
the
adjacent
wilderness
while
at
that
place
i
went
with
the
other
children
to
assist
the
hunters
to
bring
in
their
game
the
forests
on
the
sciota
were
well
stocked
with
elk
deer
and
other
large
animals
and
the
marshes
contained
large
numbers
of
beaver
muskrat
which
made
excellent
hunting
for
the
indians
who
depended
for
their
meat
upon
their
success
in
taking
elk
and
deer
and
for
ammunition
and
clothing
upon
the
beaver
muskrat
and
other
furs
that
they
could
take
in
addition
to
their
peltry
the
season
for
hunting
being
passed
we
all
returned
in
the
spring
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
shenanjee
to
the
houses
and
fields
we
had
left
in
the
fall
before
there
we
again
planted
our
corn
squashes
and
beans
on
the
fields
that
we
occupied
the
preceding
summer
about
planting
time
our
indians
all
went
up
to
fort
pitt
to
make
peace
with
the
british
and
took
me
with
them
footnote
history
is
silent
as
to
any
treaty
having
been
made
between
the
english
and
french
and
indians
at
that
time
though
it
is
possible
that
a
truce
was
agreed
upon
and
that
the
parties
met
for
the
purpose
of
concluding
a
treaty
of
peace
we
landed
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
the
fort
and
encamped
for
the
night
early
the
next
morning
the
indians
took
me
over
to
the
fort
to
see
the
white
people
that
were
there
it
was
then
that
my
heart
bounded
to
be
liberated
from
the
indians
and
to
be
restored
to
my
friends
and
my
country
the
white
people
were
surprized
to
see
me
with
the
indians
enduring
the
hardships
of
a
savage
life
at
so
early
an
age
and
with
so
delicate
a
constitution
as
i
appeared
to
possess
they
asked
me
my
name
where
and
when
i
was
taken
and
appeared
very
much
interested
on
my
behalf
they
were
continuing
their
inquiries
when
my
sisters
became
alarmed
believing
that
i
should
be
taken
from
them
hurried
me
into
their
canoe
and
recrossed
the
river
took
their
bread
out
of
the
fire
and
fled
with
me
without
stopping
till
they
arrived
at
the
river
shenanjee
so
great
was
their
fear
of
losing
me
or
of
my
being
given
up
in
the
treaty
that
they
never
once
stopped
rowing
till
they
got
home
shortly
after
we
left
the
shore
opposite
the
fort
as
i
was
informed
by
one
of
my
indian
brothers
the
white
people
came
over
to
take
me
back
but
after
considerable
inquiry
and
having
made
diligent
search
to
find
where
i
was
hid
they
returned
with
heavy
hearts
although
i
had
then
been
with
the
indians
something
over
a
year
and
had
become
considerably
habituated
to
their
mode
of
living
and
attached
to
my
sisters
the
sight
of
white
people
who
could
speak
english
inspired
me
with
an
unspeakable
anxiety
to
go
home
with
them
and
share
in
the
blessings
of
civilization
my
sudden
departure
and
escape
from
them
seemed
like
a
second
captivity
and
for
a
long
time
i
brooded
the
thoughts
of
my
miserable
situation
with
almost
as
much
sorrow
and
dejection
as
i
had
done
those
of
my
first
sufferings
time
the
destroyer
of
every
affection
wore
away
my
unpleasant
feelings
and
i
became
as
contented
as
before
we
tended
our
cornfields
through
the
summer
and
after
we
had
harvested
the
crop
we
again
went
down
the
river
to
the
hunting
ground
on
the
sciota
where
we
spent
the
winter
as
we
had
done
the
winter
before
early
in
the
spring
we
sailed
up
the
ohio
river
to
a
place
that
the
indians
called
wiishto
footnote
wiishto
i
suppose
was
situated
near
the
mouth
of
indian
guyundat
miles
below
pittsburgh
and
above
big
sciota
or
at
the
mouth
of
swan
creek
miles

one
river
emptied
into
the
ohio
on
one
side
and
another
on
the
other
at
that
place
the
indians
built
a
town
and
we
planted
corn
we
lived
three
summers
at
wiishto
and
spent
each
winter
on
the
sciota
the
first
summer
of
our
living
at
wiishto
a
party
of
delaware
indians
came
up
the
river
took
up
their
residence
and
lived
in
common
with
us
they
brought
five
white
prisoners
with
them
who
by
their
conversation
made
my
situation
much
more
agreeable
as
they
could
all
speak
english
i
have
forgotten
the
names
of
all
of
them
except
one
which
was
priscilla
ramsay
she
was
a
very
handsome
good
natured
girl
and
was
married
soon
after
she
came
to
wiishto
to
capt
little
billy
uncle
who
went
with
her
on
a
visit
to
her
friends
in
the
states
having
tarried
with
them
as
long
as
she
wished
to
she
returned
with
her
husband
to
where
he
died
she
after
his
death
married
a
white
man
by
the
name
of
nettles
and
now
lives
with
him
if
she
is
living
on
grand
river
upper
canada
not
long
after
the
delawares
came
to
live
with
us
at
wiishto
my
sisters
told
me
that
i
must
go
and
live
with
one
of
them
whose
name
was
sheninjee
not
daring
to
cross
them
or
disobey
their
commands
with
a
great
degree
of
reluctance
i
went
and
sheninjee
and
i
were
married
according
to
indian
custom
sheninjee
was
a
noble
man
large
in
stature
elegant
in
his
appearance
generous
in
his
conduct
courageous
in
war
a
friend
to
peace
and
a
great
lover
of
justice
he
supported
a
degree
of
dignity
far
above
his
rank
and
merited
and
received
the
confidence
and
friendship
of
all
the
tribes
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
yet
sheninjee
was
an
indian
the
idea
of
spending
my
days
with
him
at
first
seemed
perfectly
irreconcilable
to
my
feelings
but
his
good
nature
generosity
tenderness
and
friendship
towards
me
soon
gained
my
affection
and
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
loved
him
to
me
he
was
ever
kind
in
sickness
and
always
treated
me
with
gentleness
in
fact
he
was
an
agreeable
husband
and
a
comfortable
companion
we
lived
happily
together
till
the
time
of
our
final
separation
which
happened
two
or
three
years
after
our
marriage
as
i
shall
presently
relate
in
the
second
summer
of
my
living
at
wiishto
i
had
a
child
at
the
time
that
the
kernels
of
corn
first
appeared
on
the
cob
when
i
was
taken
sick
sheninjee
was
absent
and
i
was
sent
to
a
small
shed
on
the
bank
of
the
river
which
was
made
of
boughs
where
i
was
obliged
to
stay
till
my
husband
returned
my
two
sisters
who
were
my
only
companions
attended
me
and
on
the
second
day
of
my
confinement
my
child
was
born
but
it
lived
only
two
days
it
was
a
girl
and
notwithstanding
the
shortness
of
the
time
that
i
possessed
it
it
was
a
great
grief
to
me
to
lose
it
after
the
birth
of
my
child
i
was
very
sick
but
was
not
allowed
to
go
into
the
house
for
two
weeks
when
to
my
great
joy
sheninjee
returned
and
i
was
taken
in
and
as
comfortably
provided
for
as
our
situation
would
admit
of
my
disease
continued
to
increase
for
a
number
of
days
and
i
became
so
far
reduced
that
my
recovery
was
despaired
of
by
my
friends
and
i
concluded
that
my
troubles
would
soon
be
finished
at
length
however
my
complaint
took
a
favorable
turn
and
by
the
time
that
the
corn
was
ripe
i
was
able
to
get
about
i
continued
to
gain
my
health
and
in
the
fall
was
able
to
go
to
our
winter
quarters
on
the
sciota
with
the
indians
from
that
time
nothing
remarkable
occurred
to
me
till
the
fourth
winter
of
my
captivity
when
i
had
a
son
born
while
i
was
at
sciota
i
had
a
quick
recovery
and
my
child
was
healthy
to
commemorate
the
name
of
my
much
lamented
father
i
called
my
son

and

in
the

when
thomas
was
three
or
four
moons
months
old
we
returned
from
sciota
to
wiishto
and
soon
after
set
out
to
go
to
fort
pitt
to
dispose
of
our
fur
and
skins
that
we
had
taken
in
the
winter
and
procure
some
necessary
articles
for
the
use
of
our
family
i
had
then
been
with
the
indians
four
summers
and
four
winters
and
had
become
so
far
accustomed
to
their
mode
of
living
habits
and
dispositions
that
my
anxiety
to
get
away
to
be
set
at
liberty
and
leave
them
had
almost
subsided
with
them
was
my
home
my
family
was
there
and
there
i
had
many
friends
to
whom
i
was
warmly
attached
in
consideration
of
the
favors
affection
and
friendship
with
which
they
had
uniformly
treated
me
from
the
time
of
my
adoption
our
labor
was
not
severe
and
that
of
one
year
was
exactly
similar
in
almost
every
respect
to
that
of
the
others
without
that
endless
variety
that
is
to
be
observed
in
the
common
labor
of
the
white
people
notwithstanding
the
indian
women
have
all
the
fuel
and
bread
to
procure
and
the
cooking
to
perform
their
task
is
probably
not
harder
than
that
of
white
women
who
have
those
articles
provided
for
them
and
their
cares
certainly
are
not
half
as
numerous
nor
as
great
in
the
summer
season
we
planted
tended
and
harvested
our
corn
and
generally
had
all
our
children
with
us
but
had
no
master
to
oversee
or
drive
us
so
that
we
could
work
as
leisurely
as
we
pleased
we
had
no
ploughs
on
the
ohio
but
performed
the
whole
process
of
planting
and
hoeing
with
a
small
tool
that
resembled
in
some
respects
a
hoe
with
a
very
short
handle
our
cooking
consisted
in
pounding
our
corn
into
samp
or
hommany
boiling
the
hommany
making
now
and
then
a
cake
and
baking
it
in
the
ashes
and
in
boiling
or
roasting
our
venison
as
our
cooking
and
eating
utensils
consisted
of
a
hommany
block
and
pestle
a
small
kettle
a
knife
or
two
and
a
few
vessels
of
bark
or
wood
it
required
but
little
time
to
keep
them
in
order
for
use
spinning
weaving
sewing
stocking
knitting
and
the
like
are
arts
which
have
never
been
practised
in
the
indian
tribes
generally
after
the
revolutionary
war
i
learned
to
sew
so
that
i
could
make
my
own
clothing
after
a
poor
fashion
but
the
other
domestic
arts
i
have
been
wholly
ignorant
of
the
application
of
since
my
captivity
in
the
season
of
hunting
it
was
our
business
in
addition
to
our
cooking
to
bring
home
the
game
that
was
taken
by
the
indians
dress
it
and
carefully
preserve
the
eatable
meat
and
prepare
or
dress
the
skins
our
clothing
was
fastened
together
with
strings
of
deer
skin
and
tied
on
with
the
same
in
that
manner
we
lived
without
any
of
those
jealousies
quarrels
and
revengeful
battles
between
families
and
individuals
which
have
been
common
in
the
indian
tribes
since
the
introduction
of
ardent
spirits
amongst
them
the
use
of
ardent
spirits
amongst
the
indians
and
the
attempts
which
have
been
made
to
civilize
and
christianize
them
by
the
white
people
has
constantly
made
them
worse
and
worse
increased
their
vices
and
robbed
them
of
many
of
their
virtues
and
will
ultimately
produce
their
extermination
i
have
seen
in
a
number
of
instances
the
effects
of
education
upon
some
of
our
indians
who
were
taken
when
young
from
their
families
and
placed
at
school
before
they
had
had
an
opportunity
to
contract
many
indian
habits
and
there
kept
till
they
arrived
to
manhood
but
i
have
never
seen
one
of
those
but
what
was
an
indian
in
every
respect
after
he
returned
indians
must
and
will
be
indians
in
spite
of
all
the
means
that
can
be
used
for
their
cultivation
in
the
sciences
and
arts
one
thing
only
marred
my
happiness
while
i
lived
with
them
on
the
ohio
and
that
was
the
recollection
that
i
had
once
had
tender
parents
and
a
home
that
i
loved
aside
from
that
consideration
or
if
i
had
been
taken
in
infancy
i
should
have
been
contented
in
my
situation
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
said
against
the
indians
in
consequence
of
their
cruelties
to
their
enemies
cruelties
that
i
have
witnessed
and
had
abundant
proof
of
it
is
a
fact
that
they
are
naturally
kind
tender
and
peaceable
towards
their
friends
and
strictly
honest
and
that
those
cruelties
have
been
practised
only
upon
their
enemies
according
to
their
idea
of
justice
at
the
time
we
left
wiishto
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
suppress
a
sigh
of
regret
on
parting
with
those
who
had
truly
been
my
friends
with
those
whom
i
had
every
reason
to
respect
on
account
of
a
part
of
our
family
living
at
genishau
we
thought
it
doubtful
whether
we
should
return
directly
from
pittsburgh
or
go
from
thence
on
a
visit
to
see
them
our
company
consisted
of
my
husband
my
two
indian
brothers
my
little
son
and
myself
we
embarked
in
a
canoe
that
was
large
enough
to
contain
ourselves
and
our
effects
and
proceeded
on
our
voyage
up
the
river
nothing
remarkable
occurred
to
us
on
our
way
till
we
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
a
creek
which
sheninjee
and
my
brother
said
was
the
outlet
of
sandusky
lake
where
as
they
said
two
or
three
english
traders
in
fur
and
skins
had
kept
a
trading
house
but
a
short
time
before
though
they
were
then
absent
we
had
passed
the
trading
house
but
a
short
distance
when
we
met
three
white
men
floating
down
the
river
with
the
appearance
of
having
been
recently
murdered
by
the
indians
we
supposed
them
to
be
the
bodies
of
the
traders
whose
store
we
had
passed
the
same
day
sheninjee
being
alarmed
for
fear
of
being
apprehended
as
one
of
the
murderers
if
he
should
go
on
resolved
to
put
about
immediately
and
we
accordingly
returned
to
where
the
traders
had
lived
and
there
landed
at
the
trading
house
we
found
a
party
of
shawnee
indians
who
had
taken
a
young
white
man
prisoner
and
had
just
begun
to
torture
him
for
the
sole
purpose
of
gratifying
their
curiosity
in
exulting
at
his
distress
they
at
first
made
him
stand
up
while
they
slowly
pared
his
ears
and
split
them
into
strings
they
then
made
a
number
of
slight
incisions
in
his
face
and
then
bound
him
upon
the
ground
rolled
him
in
the
dirt
and
rubbed
it
in
his
wounds
some
of
them
at
the
same
time
whipping
him
with
small
rods
the
poor
fellow
cried
for
mercy
and
yelled
most
piteously
the
sight
of
his
distress
seemed
too
much
for
me
to
endure
i
begged
of
them
to
desist
i
entreated
them
with
tears
to
release
him
at
length
they
attended
to
my
intercessions
and
set
him
at
liberty
he
was
shockingly
disfigured
bled
profusely
and
appeared
to
be
in
great
pain
but
as
soon
as
he
was
liberated
he
made
off
in
haste
which
was
the
last
i
saw
of
him
we
soon
learned
that
the
same
party
of
shawnees
had
but
a
few
hours
before
massacred
the
three
white
traders
whom
we
saw
in
the
river
and
had
plundered
their
store
we
however
were
not
molested
by
them
and
after
a
short
stay
at
that
place
moved
up
the
creek
about
forty
miles
to
a
shawnee
town
which
the
indians
called
which
being
interpreted
signifies
a
mask
or
a
false
face
the
creek
that
we
went
up
was
called
candusky
it
was
now
summer
and
having
tarried
a
few
days
at
gawgushshawga
we
moved
on
up
the
creek
to
a
place
that
was
called
meaning
in
english
open
mouth
as
i
have
before
observed
the
family
to
which
i
belonged
was
part
of
a
tribe
of
seneca
indians
who
lived
at
that
time
at
a
place
called
genishau
from
the
name
of
the
tribe
that
was
situated
on
a
river
of
the
same
name
which
is
now
called
genesee
the
word
genishau
signifies
a
shining
clear
or
open
place
those
of
us
who
lived
on
the
ohio
had
frequently
received
invitations
from
those
at
genishau
by
one
of
my
brothers
who
usually
went
and
returned
every
season
to
come
and
live
with
them
and
my
two
sisters
had
been
gone
almost
two
years
while
we
were
at
yiskahwana
my
brother
arrived
there
from
genishau
and
insisted
so
strenuously
upon
our
going
home
as
he
called
it
with
him
that
my
two
brothers
concluded
to
go
and
to
take
me
with
them
by
this
time
the
summer
was
gone
and
the
time
for
harvesting
corn
had
arrived
my
brothers
for
fear
of
the
rainy
season
setting
in
early
thought
it
best
to
set
out
immediately
that
we
might
have
good
travelling
sheninjee
consented
to
have
me
go
with
my
brothers
but
concluded
to
go
down
the
river
himself
with
some
fur
and
skins
which
he
had
on
hand
spend
the
winter
in
hunting
with
his
friends
and
come
to
me
in
the
spring
following
that
was
accordingly
agreed
upon
and
he
set
out
for
wiishto
and
my
three
brothers
and
myself
with
my
little
son
on
my
back
at
the
same
time
set
out
for
genishau
we
came
on
to
upper
sandusky
to
an
indian
town
that
we
found
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
in
consequence
of
their
having
recently
murdered
some
english
traders
who
resided
amongst
them
that
town
was
owned
and
had
been
occupied
by
delaware
indians
who
when
they
left
it
buried
their
provision
in
the
earth
in
order
to
preserve
it
from
their
enemies
or
to
have
a
supply
for
themselves
if
they
should
chance
to
return
my
brothers
understood
the
customs
of
the
indians
when
they
were
obliged
to
fly
from
their
enemies
and
suspecting
that
their
corn
at
least
must
have
been
hid
made
diligent
search
and
at
length
found
a
large
quantity
of
it
together
with
beans
sugar
and
honey
so
carefully
buried
that
it
was
completely
dry
and
as
good
as
when
they
left
it
as
our
stock
of
provision
was
scanty
we
considered
ourselves
extremely
fortunate
in
finding
so
seasonable
a
supply
with
so
little
trouble
having
caught
two
or
three
horses
that
we
found
there
and
furnished
ourselves
with
a
good
store
of
food
we
travelled
on
till
we
came
to
the
mouth
of
french
creek
where
we
hunted
two
days
and
from
thence
came
on
to
conowongo
creek
where
we
were
obliged
to
stay
seven
or
ten
days
in
consequence
of
our
horses
having
left
us
and
straying
into
the
woods
the
horses
however
were
found
and
we
again
prepared
to
resume
our
journey
during
our
stay
at
that
place
the
rain
fell
fast
and
had
raised
the
creek
to
such
a
height
that
it
was
seemingly
impossible
for
us
to
cross
it
a
number
of
times
we
ventured
in
but
were
compelled
to
return
barely
escaping
with
our
lives
at
length
we
succeeded
in
swimming
our
horses
and
reached
the
opposite
shore
though
i
but
just
escaped
with
my
little
boy
from
being
drowned
from
sandusky
the
path
that
we
travelled
was
crooked
and
obscure
but
was
tolerably
well
understood
by
my
oldest
brother
who
had
travelled
it
a
number
of
times
when
going
to
and
returning
from
the
cherokee
wars
the
fall
by
this
time
was
considerably
advanced
and
the
rains
attended
with
cold
winds
continued
daily
to
increase
the
difficulties
of
travelling
from
conowongo
we
came
to
a
place
called
by
the
indians
and
from
that
to
which
means
an
eddy
not
strong
where
the
early
frosts
had
destroyed
the
corn
so
that
the
indians
were
in
danger
of
starving
for
the
want
of
bread
having
rested
ourselves
two
days
at
that
place
we
came
on
to
caneadea
and
stayed
one
day
and
then
continued
our
march
till
we
arrived
at
genishau
genishau
at
that
time
was
a
large
seneca
town
thickly
inhabited
lying
on
genesee
river
opposite
what
is
now
called
the
free
ferry
adjoining
and
about
south
west
of
the
present
village
of
geneseo
the
county
seat
for
the
county
of
livingston
in
the
state
of
those
only
who
have
travelled
on
foot
the
distance
of
five
or
six
hundred
miles
through
an
almost
pathless
wilderness
can
form
an
idea
of
the
fatigue
and
sufferings
that
i
endured
on
that
journey
my
clothing
was
thin
and
illy
calculated
to
defend
me
from
the
continually
drenching
rains
with
which
i
was
daily
completely
wet
and
at
night
with
nothing
but
my
wet
blanket
to
cover
me
i
had
to
sleep
on
the
naked
ground
and
generally
without
a
shelter
save
such
as
nature
had
provided
in
addition
to
all
that
i
had
to
carry
my
child
then
about
nine
months
old
every
step
of
the
journey
on
my
back
or
in
my
arms
and
provide
for
his
comfort
and
prevent
his
suffering
as
far
as
my
poverty
of
means
would
admit
such
was
the
fatigue
that
i
sometimes
felt
that
i
thought
it
impossible
for
me
to
go
through
and
i
would
almost
abandon
the
idea
of
even
trying
to
proceed
my
brothers
were
attentive
and
at
length
as
i
have
stated
we
reached
our
place
of
destination
in
good
health
and
without
having
experienced
a
sickness
from
the
time
we
left
yiskahwana
we
were
kindly
received
by
my
indian
mother
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
who
appeared
to
make
me
welcome
and
my
two
sisters
whom
i
had
not
seen
in
two
years
received
me
with
every
expression
of
love
and
friendship
and
that
they
really
felt
what
they
expressed
i
have
never
had
the
least
reason
to
doubt
the
warmth
of
their
feelings
the
kind
reception
which
i
met
with
and
the
continued
favors
that
i
received
at
their
hands
rivetted
my
affection
for
them
so
strongly
that
i
am
constrained
to
believe
that
i
loved
them
as
i
should
have
loved
my
own
sister
had
she
lived
and
i
had
been
brought

when
we
arrived
at
genishau
the
indians
of
that
tribe
were
making
active
preparations
for
joining
the
french
in
order
to
assist
them
in
retaking

called

the

who

arrival

and

in
all
the
habiliments
of

warfare
determined
on
death
or
victory
and
joined
the
army
in

to
assist
in
accomplishing
a
plan
that
had
been
previously
concerted
for
the
destruction
of
a
part
of
the
british
army
the
british
feeling
themselves
secure
in
the
possession
of
fort
neagaw
and
unwilling
that
their
enemies
should
occupy
any
of
the
military
posts
in
that
quarter
determined
to
take
fort
schlosser
lying
a
few
miles
up
the
river
from
neagaw
which
they
expected
to
effect
with
but
little
loss
accordingly
a
detachment
of
soldiers
sufficiently
numerous
as
was
supposed
was
sent
out
to
take
it
leaving
a
strong
garrison
in
the
fort
and
marched
off
well
prepared
to
effect
their
object
but
on
their
way
they
were
surrounded
by
the
french
and
indians
who
lay
in
ambush
to
deceive
them
and
were
driven
off
the
bank
of
the
river
into
a
place
called
the
devil
hole
together
with
their
horses
carriages
artillery
and
every
thing
pertaining
to
the
army
not
a
single
man
escaped
being
driven
off
and
of
the
whole
number
one
only
was
fortunate
enough
to
escape
with
his
life
footnote
for
the
particulars
of
that
event
see
appendix
no
our
indians
were
absent
but
a
few
days
and
returned
in
triumph
bringing
with
them
two
white
prisoners
and
a
number
of
oxen
those
were
the
first
neat
cattle
that
were
ever
brought
to
the
genesee
flats
the
next
day
after
their
return
to
genishau
was
set
apart
as
a
day
of
feasting
and
frolicing
at
the
expence
of
the
lives
of
their
two
unfortunate
prisoners
on
whom
they
purposed
to
glut
their
revenge
and
satisfy
their
love
for
retaliation
upon
their
enemies
my
sister
was
anxious
to
attend
the
execution
and
to
take
me
with
her
to
witness
the
customs
of
the
warriors
as
it
was
one
of
the
highest
kind
of
frolics
ever
celebrated
in
their
tribe
and
one
that
was
not
often
attended
with
so
much
pomp
and
parade
as
it
was
expected
that
would
be
i
felt
a
kind
of
anxiety
to
witness
the
scene
having
never
attended
an
execution
and
yet
i
felt
a
kind
of
horrid
dread
that
made
my
heart
revolt
and
inclined
me
to
step
back
rather
than
support
the
idea
of
advancing
on
the
morning
of
the
execution
she
made
her
intention
of
going
to
the
frolic
and
taking
me
with
her
known
to
our
mother
who
in
the
most
feeling
terms
remonstrated
against
a
step
at
once
so
rash
and
unbecoming
the
true
dignity
of
our
sex
how
my
daughter
said
she
addressing
my
sister
how
can
you
even
think
of
attending
the
feast
and
seeing
the
unspeakable
torments
that
those
poor
unfortunate
prisoners
must
inevitably
suffer
from
the
hands
of
our
warriors
how
can
you
stand
and
see
them
writhing
in
the
warriors
fire
in
all
the
agonies
of
a
slow
a
lingering
death
how
can
you
think
of
enduring
the
sound
of
their
groanings
and
prayers
to
the
great
spirit
for
sudden
deliverance
from
their
enemies
or
from
life
and
how
can
you
think
of
conducting
to
that
melancholy
spot
your
poor
sister
dickewamis
meaning
myself
who
has
so
lately
been
a
prisoner
who
has
lost
her
parents
and
brothers
by
the
hands
of
the
bloody
warriors
and
who
has
felt
all
the
horrors
of
the
loss
of
her
freedom
in
lonesome
captivity
oh
how
can
you
think
of
making
her
bleed
at
the
wounds
which
now
are
but
partially
healed
the
recollection
of
her
former
troubles
would
deprive
us
of
dickewamis
and
she
would
depart
to
the
fields
of
the
blessed
where
fighting
has
ceased
and
the
corn
needs
no
tending
where
hunting
is
easy
the
forests
delightful
the
summers
are
pleasant
and
the
winters
are
mild
o
think
once
my
daughter
how
soon
you
may
have
a
brave
brother
made
prisoner
in
battle
and
sacrificed
to
feast
the
ambition
of
the
enemies
of
his
kindred
and
leave
us
to
mourn
for
the
loss
of
a
friend
a
son
and
a
brother
whose
bow
brought
us
venison
and
supplied
us
with
blankets
our
task
is
quite
easy
at
home
and
our
business
needs
our
attention
with
war
we
have
nothing
to
do
our
husbands
and
brothers
are
proud
to
defend
us
and
their
hearts
beat
with
ardor
to
meet
our
proud
foes
oh
stay
then
my
daughter
let
our
warriors
alone
perform
on
their
victims
their
customs
of
war
this
speech
of
our
mother
had
the
desired
effect
we
stayed
at
home
and
attended
to
our
domestic
concerns
the
prisoners
however
were
executed
by
having
their
heads
taken
off
their
bodies
cut
in
pieces
and
shockingly
mangled
and
then
burnt
to
ashes
they
were
burnt
on
the
north
side
of
directly
opposite
the
town
which
was
on
the
south
side
some
time
in
the
month
of
november
i
spent
the
winter
comfortably
and
as
agreeably
as
i
could
have
expected
to
in
the
absence
of
my
kind
husband
spring
at
length
appeared
but
sheninjee
was
yet
away
summer
came
on
but
my
husband
had
not
found
me
fearful
forebodings
haunted
my
imagination
yet
i
felt
confident
that
his
affection
for
me
was
so
great
that
if
he
was
alive
he
would
follow
me
and
i
should
again
see
him
in
the
course
of
the
summer
however
i
received
intelligence
that
soon
after
he
left
me
at
yiskahwana
he
was
taken
sick
and
died
at
wiishto
this
was
a
heavy
and
an
unexpected
blow
i
was
now
in
my
youthful
days
left
a
widow
with
one
son
and
entirely
dependent
on
myself
for
his
and
my
support
my
mother
and
her
family
gave
me
all
the
consolation
in
their
power
and
in
a
few
months
nay
grief
wore
off
and
i
became
contented
in
a
year
or
two
after
this
according
to
my
best
recollection
of
the
time
the
king
of
england
offered
a
bounty
to
those
who
would
bring
in
the
prisoners
that
had
been
taken
in
the
war
to
some
military
post
where
they
might
be
redeemed
and
set
at
liberty
john
van
sice
a
dutchman
who
had
frequently
been
at
our
place
and
was
well
acquainted
with
every
prisoner
at
genishau
resolved
to
take
me
to
niagara
that
i
might
there
receive
my
liberty
and
he
the
offered
bounty
i
was
notified
of
his
intention
but
as
i
was
fully
determined
not
to
be
redeemed
at
that
time
especially
with
his
assistance
i
carefully
watched
his
movements
in
order
to
avoid
falling
into
his
hands
it
so
happened
however
that
he
saw
me
alone
at
work
in
a
and
thinking
probably
that
he
could
secure
me
easily
ran
towards
me
in
great
haste
i
espied
him
at
some
distance
and
well
knowing
the
amount
of
his
errand
run
from
him
with
all
the
speed
i
was
mistress
of
and
never
once
stopped
till
i
reached
gardow
footnote
i
have
given
this
orthography
because
it
corresponds
with
the
popular
pronunciation
he
gave
up
the
chase
and
returned
but
i
fearing
that
he
might
be
lying
in
wait
for
me
stayed
three
days
and
three
nights
in
an
old
cabin
at
gardow
and
then
went
back
trembling
at
every
step
for
fear
of
being
apprehended
i
got
home
without
difficulty
and
soon
after
the
chiefs
in
council
having
learned
the
cause
of
my
elopement
gave
orders
that
i
should
not
be
taken
to
any
military
post
without
my
consent
and
that
as
it
was
my
choice
to
stay
i
should
live
amongst
them
quietly
and
undisturbed
but
notwithstanding
the
will
of
the
chiefs
it
was
but
a
few
days
before
the
old
king
of
our
tribe
told
one
of
my
indian
brothers
that
i
should
be
redeemed
and
he
would
take
me
to
niagara
himself
in
reply
to
the
old
king
my
brother
said
that
i
should
not
be
given
up
but
that
as
it
was
my
wish
i
should
stay
with
the
tribe
as
long
as
i
was
pleased
to
upon
this
a
serious
quarrel
ensued
between
them
in
which
my
brother
frankly
told
him
that
sooner
than
i
should
be
taken
by
force
he
would
kill
me
with
his
own
hands
highly
enraged
at
the
old
king
my
brother
came
to
my
sister
house
where
i
resided
and
informed
her
of
all
that
had
passed
respecting
me
and
that
if
the
old
king
should
attempt
to
take
me
as
he
firmly
believed
he
would
he
would
immediately
take
my
life
and
hazard
the
consequences
he
returned
to
the
old
king
as
soon
as
i
came
in
my
sister
told
me
what
she
had
just
heard
and
what
she
expected
without
doubt
would
befal
me
full
of
pity
and
anxious
for
my
preservation
she
then
directed
me
to
take
my
child
and
go
into
some
high
weeds
at
no
great
distance
from
the
house
and
there
hide
myself
and
lay
still
till
all
was
silent
in
the
house
for
my
brother
she
said
would
return
at
evening
and
let
her
know
the
final
conclusion
of
the
matter
of
which
she
promised
to
inform
me
in
the
following
manner
if
i
was
to
be
killed
she
said
she
would
bake
a
small
cake
and
lay
it
at
the
door
on
the
outside
in
a
place
that
she
then
pointed
out
to
me
when
all
was
silent
in
the
house
i
was
to
creep
softly
to
the
door
and
if
the
cake
could
not
be
found
in
the
place
specified
i
was
to
go
in
but
if
the
cake
was
there
i
was
to
take
my
child
and
go
as
fast
as
i
possibly
could
to
a
large
spring
on
the
south
side
of
samp
creek
a
place
that
i
had
often
seen
and
there
wait
till
i
should
by
some
means
hear
from
her
alarmed
for
my
own
safety
i
instantly
followed
her
advice
and
went
into
the
weeds
where
i
lay
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
anxiety
till
all
was
silent
in
the
house
when
i
crept
to
the
door
and
there
found
to
my
great
distress
the
little
cake
i
knew
my
fate
was
fixed
unless
i
could
keep
secreted
till
the
storm
was
over
and
accordingly
crept
back
to
the
weeds
where
my
little
thomas
lay
took
him
on
my
back
and
laid
my
course
for
the
spring
as
fast
as
my
legs
would
carry
me
thomas
was
nearly
three
years
old
and
very
large
and
heavy
i
got
to
the
spring
early
in
the
morning
almost
overcome
with
fatigue
and
at
the
same
time
fearing
that
i
might
be
pursued
and
taken
i
felt
my
life
an
almost
insupportable
burthen
i
sat
down
with
my
child
at
the
spring
and
he
and
i
made
a
breakfast
of
the
little
cake
and
water
of
the
spring
which
i
dipped
and
supped
with
the
only
implement
which
i
possessed
my
hand
in
the
morning
after
i
fled
as
was
expected
the
old
king
came
to
our
house
in
search
of
me
and
to
take
me
off
but
as
i
was
not
to
be
found
he
gave
me
up
and
went
to
niagara
with
the
prisoners
he
had
already
got
into
his
possession
as
soon
as
the
old
king
was
fairly
out
of
the
way
my
sister
told
my
brother
where
he
could
find
me
he
immediately
set
out
for
the
spring
and
found
me
about
noon
the
first
sight
of
him
made
me
tremble
with
the
fear
of
death
but
when
he
came
near
so
that
i
could
discover
his
countenance
tears
of
joy
flowed
down
my
cheeks
and
i
felt
such
a
kind
of
instant
relief
as
no
one
can
possibly
experience
unless
when
under
the
absolute
sentence
of
death
he
receives
an
unlimited
pardon
we
were
both
rejoiced
at
the
event
of
the
old
king
project
and
after
staying
at
the
spring
through
the
night
set
out
together
for
home
early
in
the
morning
when
we
got
to
a
cornfield
near
the
town
my
brother
secreted
me
till
he
could
go
and
ascertain
how
my
case
stood
and
finding
that
the
old
king
was
absent
and
that
all
was
peaceable
he
returned
to
me
and
i
went
home
joyfully
not
long
after
this
my
mother
went
to
johnstown
on
the
mohawk
river
with
five
prisoners
who
were
redeemed
by
sir
william
johnson
and
set
at
liberty
when
my
son
thomas
was
three
or
four
years
old
i
was
married
to
an
indian
whose
name
was
hiokatoo

our

had
nothing
to
trouble
it
till
the
commencement
of
the

for
twelve
or
fifteen
years
the
use
of
the
implements
of
war
was
not
known
nor
the
heard
save
on
days
of
festivity
when
the
achievements
of
former
times
were
commemorated
in
a
kind
of
mimic
warfare
in
which
the
chiefs
and
warriors
displayed
their
prowess
and
illustrated
their
former
adroitness
by
laying
the
ambuscade
surprizing
their
enemies
and
performing
many
accurate
manoeuvres
with
the
tomahawk
and
scalping
knife
thereby
preserving
and
handing
to
their
children
the
theory
of
indian
warfare
during
that
period
they
also
pertinaciously
observed
the
religious
rites
of
their
progenitors
by
attending
with
the
most
scrupulous
exactness
and
a
great
degree
of
enthusiasm
to
the
sacrifices
at
particular
times
to
appease
the
anger
of
the
evil
deity
or
to
excite
the
commisseration
and
friendship
of
the
great
good
spirit
whom
they
adored
with
reverence
as
the
author
governor
supporter
and
disposer
of
every
good
thing
of
which
they
participated
they
also
practised
in
various
athletic
games
such
as
running
wrestling
leaping
and
playing
ball
with
a
view
that
their
bodies
might
be
more
supple
or
rather
that
they
might
not
become
enervated
and
that
they
might
be
enabled
to
make
a
proper
selection
of
chiefs
for
the
councils
of
the
nation
and
leaders
for
war
while
the
indians
were
thus
engaged
in
their
round
of
traditionary
performances
with
the
addition
of
hunting
their
women
attended
to
agriculture
their
families
and
a
few
domestic
concerns
of
small
consequence
and
attended
with
but
little
labor
no
people
can
live
more
happy
than
the
indians
did
in
times
of
peace
before
the
introduction
of
spirituous
liquors
amongst
them
their
lives
were
a
continual
round
of
pleasures
their
wants
were
few
and
easily
satisfied
and
their
cares
were
only
for
the
bounds
of
their
calculations
for
future
comfort
not
extending
to
the
incalculable
uncertainties
of
if
peace
ever
dwelt
with
men
it
was
in
former
times
in
the
recesses
from
war
amongst
what
are
now
termed
barbarians
the
moral
character
of
the
indians
was
if
i
may
be
allowed
the
expression
uncontaminated
their
fidelity
was
perfect
and
became
proverbial
they
were
strictly
honest
they
despised
deception
and
falsehood
and
chastity
was
held
in
high
veneration
and
a
violation
of
it
was
considered
sacrilege
they
were
temperate
in
their
desires
moderate
in
their
passions
and
candid
and
honorable
in
the
expression
of
their
sentiments
on
every
subject
of
importance
thus
at
peace
amongst
themselves
and
with
the
neighboring
whites
though
there
were
none
at
that
time
very
near
our
indians
lived
quietly
and
peaceably
at
home
till
a
little
before
the
breaking
out
of
the
revolutionary
war
when
they
were
sent
for
together
with
the
chiefs
and
members
of
the
six
nations
generally
by
the
people
of
the
states
to
go
to
the
german
flats
and
there
hold
a
general
council
in
order
that
the
people
of
the
states
might
ascertain
in
good
season
who
they
should
esteem
and
treat
as
enemies
and
who
as
friends
in
the
great
war
which
was
then
upon
the
point
of
breaking
out
between
them
and
the
king
of
england
our
indians
obeyed
the
call
and
the
council
was
holden
at
which
the
pipe
of
peace
was
smoked
and
a
treaty
made
in
which
the
six
nations
solemnly
agreed
that
if
a
war
should
eventually
break
out
they
would
not
take
up
arms
on
either
side
but
that
they
would
observe
a
strict
neutrality
with
that
the
people
of
the
states
were
satisfied
as
they
had
not
asked
their
assistance
nor
did
not
wish
it
the
indians
returned
to
their
homes
well
pleased
that
they
could
live
on
neutral
ground
surrounded
by
the
din
of
war
without
being
engaged
in
it
about
a
year
passed
off
and
we
as
usual
were
enjoying
ourselves
in
the
employments
of
peaceable
times
when
a
messenger
arrived
from
the
british
commissioners
requesting
all
the
indians
of
our
tribe
to
attend
a
general
council
which
was
soon
to
be
held
at
oswego
the
council
convened
and
being
opened
the
british
commissioners
informed
the
chiefs
that
the
object
of
calling
a
council
of
the
six
nations
was
to
engage
their
assistance
in
subduing
the
rebels
the
people
of
the
states
who
had
risen
up
against
the
good
king
their
master
and
were
about
to
rob
him
of
a
great
part
of
his
possessions
and
wealth
and
added
that
they
would
amply
reward
them
for
all
their
services
the
chiefs
then
arose
and
informed
the
commissioners
of
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
treaty
which
they
had
entered
into
with
the
people
of
the
states
the
year
before
and
that
they
should
not
violate
it
by
taking
up
the
hatchet
against
them
the
commissioners
continued
their
entreaties
without
success
till
they
addressed
their
avarice
by
telling
our
people
that
the
people
of
the
states
were
few
in
number
and
easily
subdued
and
that
on
the
account
of
their
disobedience
to
the
king
they
justly
merited
all
the
punishment
that
it
was
possible
for
white
men
and
indians
to
inflict
upon
them
and
added
that
the
king
was
rich
and
powerful
both
in
money
and
subjects
that
his
rum
was
as
plenty
as
the
water
in
lake
ontario
that
his
men
were
as
numerous
as
the
sands
upon
the
lake
shore
and
that
the
indians
if
they
would
assist
in
the
war
and
persevere
in
their
friendship
to
the
king
till
it
was
closed
should
never
want
for
money
or
goods
upon
this
the
chiefs
concluded
a
treaty
with
the
british
commissioners
in
which
they
agreed
to
take
up
arms
against
the
rebels
and
continue
in
the
service
of
his
majesty
till
they
were
subdued
in
consideration
of
certain
conditions
which
were
stipulated
in
the
treaty
to
be
performed
by
the
british
government
and
its
agents
as
soon
as
the
treaty
was
finished
the
commissioners
made
a
present
to
each
indian
of
a
suit
of
clothes
a
brass
kettle
a
gun
and
tomahawk
a
scalping
knife
a
quantity
of
powder
and
lead
a
piece
of
gold
and
promised
a
bounty
on
every
scalp
that
should
be
brought
in
thus
richly
clad
and
equipped
they
returned
home
after
an
absence
of
about
two
weeks
full
of
the
fire
of
war
and
anxious
to
encounter
their
enemies
many
of
the
kettles
which
the
indians
received
at
that
time
are
now
in
use
on
the
genesee
flats
hired
to
commit
depredations
upon
the
whites
who
had
given
them
no
offence
they
waited
impatiently
to
commence
their
labor
till
sometime
in
the
spring
of
when
a
convenient
opportunity
offered
for
them
to
make
an
attack
at
that
time
a
party
of
our
indians
were
at
who
shot
a
man
that
was
looking
after
his
horse
for
the
sole
purpose
as
i
was
informed
by
my
indian
brother
who
was
present
of
commencing
hostilities
in
may
following
our
indians
were
in
their
first
battle
with
the
americans
but
at
what
place
i
am
unable
to
determine
while
they
were
absent
at
that
time
my
daughter
nancy
was
born
the
same
year
at
cherry
valley
our
indians
took
a
woman
and
her
three
daughters
prisoners
and
brought
them
on
leaving
one
at
canandaigua
one
at
honeoy
one
at
cattaraugus
and
one
the
woman
at
little
town
where
i
resided
the
woman
told
me
that
she
and
her
daughters
might
have
escaped
but
that
they
expected
the
british
army
only
and
therefore
made
no
effort
her
husband
and
sons
got
away
sometime
having
elapsed
they
were
redeemed
at
fort
niagara
by
butler
who
clothed
them
well
and
sent
them
home
in
the

expedition
joseph

was
taken
prisoner
at

near

detained
till

in
the

was
married
to
a
british
officer
at
fort
niagara
by
the
name
of
johnson
who
at
the
time
she
was
taken
took
a
gold
ring
from
her
finger
without
any
compliments
or
ceremonies
when
he
saw
her
at
niagara
he
recognized
her
features
restored
the
ring
that
he
had
so
impolitely
borrowed
and
courted
and
married
her
previous
to
the
battle
at
fort
stanwix
the
british
sent
for
the
indians
to
come
and
see
them
whip
the
rebels
and
at
the
same
time
stated
that
they
did
not
wish
to
have
them
fight
but
wanted
to
have
them
just
sit
down
smoke
their
pipes
and
look
on
our
indians
went
to
a
man
but
contrary
to
their
expectation
instead
of
smoking
and
looking
on
they
were
obliged
to
fight
for
their
lives
and
in
the
end
of
the
battle
were
completely
beaten
with
a
great
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
our
indians
alone
had
killed
and
a
great
number
wounded
our
town
exhibited
a
scene
of
real
sorrow
and
distress
when
our
warriors
returned
and
recounted
their
misfortunes
and
stated
the
real
loss
they
had
sustained
in
the
engagement
the
mourning
was
excessive
and
was
expressed
by
the
most
doleful
yells
shrieks
and
howlings
and
by
inimitable
gesticulations

except
in
the

who
had
been
killed
in
distant
battles
and
our
tribe
because
of
the
remoteness
of
its
situation
from
the
enemy
felt
secure
from
an
attack
at
length
in
the
fall
of
intelligence
was
received
that
a
large
and
powerful
army
of
the
rebels
under
the
command
of
general
sullivan
was
making
rapid
progress
towards
our
settlement
burning
and
destroying
the
huts
and
killing
the
cattle
hogs
and
horses
and
cutting
down
the
fruit
trees
belonging
to
the
indians
throughout
the
country
our
indians
immediately
became
alarmed
and
suffered
every
thing
but
death
from
fear
that
they
should
be
taken
by
surprize
and
totally
destroyed
at
a
single
blow
but
in
order
to
prevent
so
great
a
catastrophe
they
sent
out
a
few
spies
who
were
to
keep
themselves
at
a
short
distance
in
front
of
the
invading
army
in
order
to
watch
its
operations
and
give
information
of
its
advances
and
success
sullivan
arrived
at
canandaigua
lake
and
had
finished
his
work
of
destruction
there
and
it
was
ascertained
that
he
was
about
to
march
to
our
flats
when
our
indians
resolved
to
give
him
battle
on
the
way
and
prevent
if
possible
the
distresses
to
which
they
knew
we
should
be
subjected
if
he
should
succeed
in
reaching
our
town
accordingly
they
sent
all
their
women
and
children
into
the
woods
a
little
west
of
little
beard
town
in
order
that
we
might
make
a
good
retreat
if
it
should
be
necessary
and
then
well
armed
set
out
to
face
the
conquering
enemy
the
place
which
they
fixed
upon
for
their
battle
ground
lay
between
honeoy
creek
and
the
head
of
connessius
lake
at
length
a
scouting
party
from
sullivan
army
arrived
at
the
spot
selected
when
the
indians
arose
from
their
ambush
with
all
the
fierceness
and
terror
that
it
was
possible
for
them
to
exercise
and
directly
put
the
party
upon
a
retreat
two
oneida
indians
were
all
the
prisoners
that
were
taken
in
that
skirmish
one
of
them
was
a
pilot
of
sullivan
and
had
been
very
active
in
the
war
rendering
to
the
people
of
the
states
essential
services
at
the
commencement
of
the
revolution
he
had
a
brother
older
than
himself
who
resolved
to
join
the
british
service
and
endeavored
by
all
the
art
that
he
was
capable
of
using
to
persuade
his
brother
to
accompany
him
but
his
arguments
proved
abortive
this
went
to
the
british
and
that
joined
the
american
army
at
this
critical
juncture
they
met
one
in
the
capacity
of
a
conqueror
the
other
in
that
of
a
prisoner
and
as
an
indian
seldom
forgets
a
countenance
that
he
has
seen
they
recognized
each
other
at
sight
envy
and
revenge
glared
in
the
features
of
the
conquering
savage
as
he
advanced
to
his
brother
the
prisoner
in
all
the
haughtiness
of
indian
pride
heightened
by
a
sense
of
power
and
addressed
him
in
the
following
manner
brother
you
have
merited
death
the
hatchet
or
the
shall
finish
your
career
when
i
begged
of
you
to
follow
me
in
the
fortunes
of
war
you
was
deaf
to
my
cries
you
spurned
my
entreaties
brother
you
have
merited
death
and
shall
have
your
deserts
when
the
rebels
raised
their
hatchets
to
fight
their
good
master
you
sharpened
your
knife
you
brightened
your
rifle
and
led
on
our
foes
to
the
fields
of
our
fathers
you
have
merited
death
and
shall
die
by
our
hands
when
those
rebels
had
drove
us
from
the
fields
of
our
fathers
to
seek
out
new
homes
it
was
you
who
could
dare
to
step
forth
as
their
pilot
and
conduct
them
even
to
the
doors
of
our
wigwams
to
butcher
our
children
and
put
us
to
death
no
crime
can
be
greater
but
though
you
have
merited
death
and
shall
die
on
this
spot
my
hands
shall
not
be
stained
in
the
blood
of
a
brother
will
little
beard
who
was
standing
by
as
soon
as
the
speech
was
ended
struck
the
prisoner
on
the
head
with
his
tomahawk
and
despatched
him
at
once
little
beard
then
informed
the
other
indian
prisoner
that
as
they
were
at
war
with
the
whites
only
and
not
with
the
indians
they
would
spare
his
life
and
after
a
while
give
him
his
liberty
in
an
honorable
manner
the
oneida
warrior
however
was
jealous
of
little
beard
fidelity
and
suspecting
that
he
should
soon
fall
by
his
hands
watched
for
a
favorable
opportunity
to
make
his
escape
which
he
soon
effected
two
indians
were
leading
him
one
on
each
side
when
he
made
a
violent
effort
threw
them
upon
the
ground
and
run
for
his
life
towards
where
the
main
body
of
the
american
army
was
encamped
the
indians
pursued
him
without
success
but
in
their
absence
they
fell
in
with
a
small
detachment
of
sullivan
men
with
whom
they
had
a
short
but
severe
skirmish
in
which
they
killed
a
number
of
the
enemy
took
capt
or
lieut
william
boyd
and
one
private
prisoners
and
brought
them
to
little
beard
town
where
they
were
soon
after
put
to
death
in
the
most
shocking
and
cruel
manner
little
beard
in
this
as
in
all
other
scenes
of
cruelty
that
happened
at
his
town
was
master
of
ceremonies
and
principal
actor
poor
boyd
was
stripped
of
his
clothing
and
then
tied
to
a
sapling
where
the
indians
menaced
his
life
by
throwing
their
tomahawks
at
the
tree
directly
over
his
head
brandishing
their
scalping
knives
around
him
in
the
most
frightful
manner
and
accompanying
their
ceremonies
with
terrific
shouts
of
joy
having
punished
him
sufficiently
in
this
way
they
made
a
small
opening
in
his
abdomen
took
out
an
intestine
which
they
tied
to
the
sapling
and
then
unbound
him
from
the
tree
and
drove
him
round
it
till
he
had
drawn
out
the
whole
of
his
intestines
he
was
then
beheaded
his
head
was
stuck
upon
a
pole
and
his
body
left
on
the
ground
unburied
thus
ended
the
life
of
poor
william
boyd
who
it
was
said
had
every
appearance
of
being
an
active
and
enterprizing
officer
of
the
first
talents
the
other
prisoner
was
if
i
remember
distinctly
only
beheaded
and
left
near
boyd
this
tragedy
being
finished
our
indians
again
held
a
short
council
on
the
expediency
of
giving
sullivan
battle
if
he
should
continue
to
advance
and
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
not
strong
enough
to
drive
him
nor
to
prevent
his
taking
possession
of
their
fields
but
that
if
it
was
possible
they
would
escape
with
their
own
lives
preserve
their
families
and
leave
their
possessions
to
be
overrun
by
the
invading
army
the
women
and
children
were
then
sent
on
still
further
towards
buffalo
to
a
large
creek
that
was
called
by
the
indians
catawba
accompanied
by
a
part
of
the
indians
while
the
remainder
secreted
themselves
in
the
woods
back
of
beard
town
to
watch
the
movements
of
the
army
at
that
time
i
had
three
children
who
went
with
me
on
foot
one
who
rode
on
horse
back
and
one
whom
i
carried
on
my
back
our
corn
was
good
that
year
a
part
of
which
we
had
gathered
and
secured
for
winter
in
one
or
two
days
after
the
skirmish
at
connissius
lake
sullivan
and
his
army
arrived
at
genesee
river
where
they
destroyed
every
article
of
the
food
kind
that
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
a
pan
of
our
corn
they
burnt
and
threw
the
remainder
into
the
river
they
burnt
our
houses
killed
what
few
cattle
and
horses
they
could
find
destroyed
our
fruit
trees
and
left
nothing
but
the
bare
soil
and
timber
but
the
indians
had
eloped
and
were
not
to
be
found
having
crossed
and
recrossed
the
river
and
finished
the
work
of
destruction
the
army
marched
off
to
the
east
our
indians
saw
them
move
off
but
suspecting
that
it
was
sullivan
intention
to
watch
our
return
and
then
to
take
us
by
surprize
resolved
that
the
main
body
of
our
tribe
should
hunt
where
we
then
were
till
sullivan
had
gone
so
far
that
there
would
be
no
danger
of
his
returning
to
molest
us
this
being
agreed
to
we
hunted
continually
till
the
indians
concluded
that
there
could
be
no
risk
in
our
once
more
taking
possession
of
our
lands
accordingly
we
all
returned
but
what
were
our
feelings
when
we
found
that
there
was
not
a
mouthful
of
any
kind
of
sustenance
left
not
even
enough
to
keep
a
child
one
day
from
perishing
with
hunger
the
weather
by
this
time
had
become
cold
and
stormy
and
as
we
were
destitute
of
houses
and
food
too
i
immediately
resolved
to
take
my
children
and
look
out
for
myself
without
delay
with
this
intention
i
took
two
of
my
little
ones
on
my
back
bade
the
other
three
follow
and
the
same
night
arrived
on
the
gardow
flats
where
i
have
ever
since
resided
at
that
time
two
negroes
who
had
run
away
from
their
masters
sometime
before
were
the
only
inhabitants
of
those
flats
they
lived
in
a
small
cabin
and
had
planted
and
raised
a
large
field
of
corn
which
they
had
not
yet
harvested
as
they
were
in
want
of
help
to
secure
their
crop
i
hired
to
them
to
husk
corn
till
the
whole
was
harvested
i
have
laughed
a
thousand
times
to
myself
when
i
have
thought
of
the
good
old
negro
who
hired
me
who
fearing
that
i
should
get
taken
or
injured
by
the
indians
stood
by
me
constantly
when
i
was
husking
with
a
loaded
gun
in
his
hand
in
order
to
keep
off
the
enemy
and
thereby
lost
as
much
labor
of
his
own
as
he
received
from
me
by
paying
good
wages
i
however
was
not
displeased
with
his
attention
for
i
knew
that
i
should
need
all
the
corn
that
i
could
earn
even
if
i
should
husk
the
whole
i
husked
enough
for
them
to
gain
for
myself
at
every
tenth
string
one
hundred
strings
of
ears
which
were
equal
to
bushels
of
shelled
corn
this
seasonable
supply
made
my
family
comfortable
for
samp
and
cakes
through
the
succeeding
winter
which
was
the
most
severe
that
i
have
witnessed
since
my
remembrance
the
snow
fell
about
five
feet
deep
and
remained
so
for
a
long
time
and
the
weather
was
extremely
cold
so
much
so
indeed
that
almost
all
the
game
upon
which
the
indians
depended
for
subsistence
perished
and
reduced
them
almost
to
a
state
of
starvation
through
that
and
three
or
four
succeeding
years
when
the
snow
melted
in
the
spring
deer
were
found
dead
upon
the
ground
in
vast
numbers
and
other
animals
of
every
description
perished
from
the
cold
also
and
were
found
dead
in
multitudes
many
of
our
people
barely
escaped
with
their
lives
and
some
actually
died
of
hunger
and
freezing
but
to
return
from
this
digression
having
been
completely
routed
at
little
beard
town
deprived
of
a
house
and
without
the
means
of
building
one
in
season
after
i
had
finished
my
husking
and
having
found
from
the
short
acquaintance
which
i
had
had
with
the
negroes
that
they
were
kind
and
friendly
i
concluded
at
their
request
to
take
up
my
residence
with
them
for
a
while
in
their
cabin
till
i
should
be
able
to
provide
a
hut
for
myself
i
lived
more
comfortable
than
i
expected
to
through
the
winter
and
the
next
season
made
a
shelter
for
myself
the
negroes
continued
on
my
flats
two
or
three
years
after
this
and
then
left
them
for
a
place
that
they
expected
would
suit
them
much
better
but
as
that
land
became
my
own
in
a
few
years
by
virtue
of
a
deed
from
the
chiefs
of
the
six
nations
i
have
lived
there
from
that
to
the
present
time
my
flats
were
cleared
before
i
saw
them
and
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
oldest
indians
that
were
at
genishau
at
the
time
that
i
first
went
there
that
all
the
flats
on
the
genesee
river
were
improved
before
any
of
the
indian
tribes
ever
saw
them
i
well
remember
that
soon
after
i
went
to
little
beard
town
the
banks
of
were
washed
off
which
left
a
large
number
of
human
bones
uncovered
the
indians
then
said
that
those
were
not
the
bones
of
indians
because
they
had
never
heard
of
any
of
their
dead
being
buried
there
but
that
they
were
the
bones
of
a
race
of
men
who
a
great
many
moons
before
cleared
that
land
and
lived
on
the
flats
the
next
summer
after
sullivan
campaign
our
indians
highly
incensed
at
the
whites
for
the
treatment
they
had
received
and
the
sufferings
which
they
had
consequently
endured
determined
to
obtain
some
redress
by
destroying
their
frontier
settlements
corn
planter
otherwise
called
john
led
the
indians
and
an
officer
by
the
name
of
johnston
commanded
the
british
in
the
expedition
the
force
was
large
and
so
strongly
bent
upon
revenge
and
vengeance
that
seemingly
nothing
could
avert
its
march
nor
prevent
its
depredations
after
leaving
genesee
they
marched
directly
to
some
of
the
head
waters
of
the
susquehannah
river
and
schoharie
creek
went
down
that
creek
to
the
mohawk
river
thence
up
that
river
to
fort
stanwix
and
from
thence
came
home
in
their
route
they
burnt
a
number
of
places
destroyed
all
the
cattle
and
other
property
that
fell
in
their
way
killed
a
number
of
white
people
and
brought
home
a
few
prisoners

that
expedition
when
they
came

the
mohawk
river
corn

and
a
party
of
his
indians
took
old

a
white
man
and
made
him
a

old
john
in
his
younger
days
had
frequently
passed
through
the
indian
settlements
that
lay
between
the
hudson
and
fort
niagara
and
in
some
of
his
excursions
had
become
enamored
with
a
squaw
by
whom
he
had
a

was
called

corn

was
a
chief
of
considerable
eminence
and
having
been
informed
of
his
parentage
and
of
the
place
of
his

residence
took
the
old
man
at
this
time
in
order
that
he
might
make
an
introduction
leisurely
and
become
acquainted
with
a
man
to
whom
though
a
stranger
he
was
satisfied
that
he
owed
his
existence
after
he
had
taken
the
old
man
his
father
he
led
him
as
a
prisoner

sometime
near

close
of

revolutionary
war
a
white
man
by
the
name
of
ebenezer
allen
left
his
people
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania
on
the
account
of
some
disaffection
towards
his
countrymen
and
came
to
the
genesee
river
to
reside
with
the
indians
he
tarried
at
genishau
a
few
days
and
came
up
to
gardow
where
i
then
he
was
apparently
without
any
business
that
would
support
him
but
he
soon
became
acquainted
with
my
son
thomas
with
whom
he
hunted
for
a
long
time
and
made
his
home
with
him
at
my
house
winter
came
on
and
he
continued
his
stay
when
allen
came
to
my
house
i
had
a
white
man
living
on
my
land
who
had
a
nanticoke
squaw
for
his
wife
with
whom
he
had
lived
very
peaceably
for
he
was
a
moderate
man
commonly
and
she
was
a
kind
gentle
cunning
creature
it
so
happened
that
he
had
no
hay
for
his
cattle
so
that
in
the
winter
he
was
obliged
to
drive
them
every
day
perhaps
half
a
mile
from
his
house
to
let
them
feed
on
rushes
which
in
those
days
were
so
numerous
as
to
nearly
cover
the
ground
allen
having
frequently
seen
the
squaw
in
the
fall
took
the
opportunity
when
her
husband
was
absent
with
his
cows
daily
to
make
her
a
visit
and
in
return
for
his
kindnesses
she
made
and
gave
him
a
red
cap
finished
and
decorated
in
the
highest
indian
style
the
husband
had
for
some
considerable
length
of
time
felt
a
degree
of
jealousy
that
allen
was
trespassing
upon
him
with
the
consent
of
his
squaw
but
when
he
saw
allen
dressed
in
so
fine
an
indian
cap
and
found
that
his
dear
nanticoke
had
presented
it
to
him
his
doubts
all
left
him
and
he
became
so
violently
enraged
that
he
caught
her
by
the
hair
of
her
head
dragged
her
on
the
ground
to
my
house
a
distance
of
forty
rods
and
threw
her
in
at
the
door
hiokatoo
my
husband
exasperated
at
the
sight
of
so
much
inhumanity
hastily
took
down
his
old
tomahawk
which
for
awhile
had
lain
idle
shook
it
over
the
cuckold
head
and
bade
him
jogo
go
off
the
enraged
husband
well
knowing
that
he
should
feel
a
blow
if
he
waited
to
hear
the
order
repeated
instantly
retreated
and
went
down
the
river
to
his
cattle
we
protected
the
poor
nanticoke
woman
and
gave
her
victuals
and
allen
sympathized
with
her
in
her
misfortunes
till
spring
when
her
husband
came
to
her
acknowledged
his
former
errors
and
that
he
had
abused
her
without
a
cause
promised
a
reformation
and
she
received
him
with
every
mark
of
a
renewal
of
her
affection
they
went
home
lovingly
and
soon
after
removed
to
niagara
the
same
spring
allen
commenced
working
my
flats
and
continued
to
labor
there
till
after
the
peace
in
he
then
went
to
philadelphia
on
some
business
that
detained
him
but
a
few
days
and
returned
with
a
horse
and
some
dry
goods
which
he
carried
to
a
place
that
is
now
called
mount
morris
where
he
built
or
bought
a
small
house
the
british
and
indians
on
the
niagara
frontier
dissatisfied
with
the
treaty
of
peace
were
determined
at
all
hazards
to
continue
their
depredations
upon
the
white
settlements
which
lay
between
them
and
albany
they
actually
made
ready
and
were
about
setting
out
on
an
expedition
to
that
effect
when
allen
who
by
this
time
understood
their
customs
of
war
took
a
belt
of
wampum
which
he
had
fraudulently
procured
and
carried
it
as
a
token
of
peace
from
the
indians
to
the
commander
of
the
nearest
american
military
post
the
indians
were
soon
answered
by
the
american
officer
that
the
wampum
was
cordially
accepted
and
that
a
continuance
of
peace
was
ardently
wished
for
the
indians
at
this
were
chagrined
and
disappointed
beyond
measure
but
as
they
held
the
wampum
to
be
a
sacred
thing
they
dared
not
to
go
against
the
import
of
its
meaning
and
immediately
buried
the
hatchet
as
it
respected
the
people
of
the
united
state
and
smoked
the
pipe
of
peace
they
however
resolved
to
punish
allen
for
his
officiousness
in
meddling
with
their
national
affairs
by
presenting
the
sacred
wampum
without
their
knowledge
and
went
about
devising
means
for
his
detection
a
party
was
accordingly
despatched
from
fort
niagara
to
apprehend
him
with
orders
to
conduct
him
to
that
post
for
trial
or
for
safe
keeping
till
such
time
as
his
fate
should
be
determined
upon
in
a
legal
manner
the
party
came
on
but
before
it
arrived
at
gardow
allen
got
news
of
its
approach
and
fled
for
safety
leaving
the
horse
and
goods
that
he
had
brought
from
philadelphia
an
easy
prey
to
his
enemies
he
had
not
been
long
absent
when
they
arrived
at
gardow
where
they
made
diligent
search
for
him
till
they
were
satisfied
that
they
could
not
find
him
and
then
seized
the
effects
which
he
had
left
and
returned
to
niagara
my
son
thomas
went
with
them
with
allen
horse
and
carried
the
goods
allen
on
finding
that
his
enemies
had
gone
came
back
to
my
house
where
he
lived
as
before
but
of
his
return
they
were
soon
notified
at
niagara
and
nettles
who
married
priscilla
ramsay
with
a
small
party
of
indians
came
on
to
take
him
he
however
by
some
means
found
that
they
were
near
and
gave
me
his
box
of
money
and
trinkets
to
keep
safely
till
he
called
for
it
and
again
took
to
the
woods
nettles
came
on
determined
at
all
events
to
take
him
before
he
went
back
and
in
order
to
accomplish
his
design
he
with
his
indians
hunted
in
the
day
time
and
lay
by
at
night
at
my
house
and
in
that
way
they
practised
for
a
number
of
days
allen
watched
the
motion
of
his
pursuers
and
every
night
after
they
had
gone
to
rest
came
home
and
got
some
food
and
then
returned
to
his
retreat
it
was
in
the
fall
and
the
weather
was
cold
and
rainy
so
that
he
suffered
extremely
some
nights
he
sat
in
my
chamber
till
nearly
while
his
enemies
were
below
and
when
the
time
arrived
i
assisted
him
to
escape
unnoticed
nettles
at
length
abandoned
the
chase
went
home
and
allen
all
in
tatters
came
in
by
running
in
the
woods
his
clothing
had
become
torn
into
rags
so
that
he
was
in
a
suffering
condition
almost
naked
hiokatoo
gave
him
a
blanket
and
a
piece
of
broadcloth
for
a
pair
of
trowsers
allen
made
his
trowsers
himself
and
then
built
a
raft
on
which
he
went
down
the
river
to
his
own
place
at
mount
morris
about
that
time
he
married
a
squaw
whose
name
was
sally
the
niagara
people
finding
that
he
was
at
his
own
house
came
and
took
him
by
surprize
when
he
least
expected
them
and
carried
him
to
niagara
fortunately
for
him
it
so
happened
that
just
as
they
arrived
at
the
fort
a
house
took
fire
and
his
keepers
all
left
him
to
save
the
building
if
possible
allen
had
supposed
his
doom
to
be
nearly
sealed
but
finding
himself
at
liberty
he
took
to
his
heels
left
his
escort
to
put
out
the
fire
and
ran
to
tonnawanta
there
an
indian
gave
him
some
refreshment
and
a
good
gun
with
which
he
hastened
on
to
little
town
where
he
found
his
squaw
not
daring
to
risk
himself
at
that
place
for
fear
of
being
given
up
he
made
her
but
a
short
visit
and
came
immediately
to
gardow
just
as
he
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
above
the
gardow
flats
he
discovered
a
party
of
british
soldiers
and
indians
in
pursuit
of
him
and
in
fact
they
were
so
near
that
he
was
satisfied
that
they
saw
him
and
concluded
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
escape
the
love
of
liberty
however
added
to
his
natural
swiftness
gave
him
sufficient
strength
to
make
his
escape
to
his
former
castle
of
safety
his
pursuers
came
immediately
to
my
house
where
they
expected
to
have
found
him
secreted
and
under
my
protection
they
told
me
where
they
had
seen
him
but
a
few
moments
before
and
that
they
were
confident
that
it
was
within
my
power
to
put
him
into
their
hands
as
i
was
perfectly
clear
of
having
had
any
hand
in
his
escape
i
told
them
plainly
that
i
had
not
seen
him
since
he
was
taken
to
niagara
and
that
i
could
give
them
no
information
at
all
respecting
him
still
unsatisfied
and
doubting
my
veracity
they
advised
my
indian
brother
to
use
his
influence
to
draw
from
me
the
secret
of
his
concealment
which
they
had
an
idea
that
i
considered
of
great
importance
not
only
to
him
but
to
myself
i
persisted
in
my
ignorance
of
his
situation
and
finally
they
left
me
although
i
had
not
seen
allen
i
knew
his
place
of
security
and
was
well
aware
that
if
i
told
them
the
place
where
he
had
formerly
hid
himself
they
would
have
no
difficulty
in
making
him
a
prisoner
he
came
to
my
house
in
the
night
and
awoke
me
with
the
greatest
caution
fearing
that
some
of
his
enemies
might
be
watching
to
take
him
at
a
time
when
and
in
a
place
where
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
make
his
escape
i
got
up
and
assured
him
that
he
was
then
safe
but
that
his
enemies
would
return
early
in
the
morning
and
search
him
out
if
it
should
be
possible
having
given
him
some
victuals
which
he
received
thankfully
i
told
him
to
go
but
to
return
the
next
night
to
a
certain
corner
of
the
fence
near
my
house
where
he
would
find
a
quantity
of
meal
that
i
would
have
well
prepared
and
deposited
there
for
his
use
early
the
next
morning
nettles
and
his
company
came
in
while
i
was
pounding
the
meal
for
allen
and
insisted
upon
my
giving
him
up
i
again
told
them
that
i
did
not
know
where
he
was
and
that
i
could
not
neither
would
i
tell
them
any
thing
about
him
i
well
knew
that
allen
considered
his
life
in
my
hands
and
although
it
was
my
intention
not
to
lie
i
was
fully
determined
to
keep
his
situation
a
profound
secret
they
continued
their
labor
and
examined
as
they
supposed
every
crevice
gully
tree
and
hollow
log
in
the
neighboring
woods
and
at
last
concluded
that
he
had
left
the
country
and
gave
him
up
for
lost
and
went
home
at
that
time
allen
lay
in
a
secret
place
in
the
gulph
a
short
distance
above
my
flats
in
a
hole
that
he
accidentally
found
in
the
rock
near
the
river
at
night
he
came
and
got
the
meal
at
the
corner
of
the
fence
as
i
had
directed
him
and
afterwards
lived
in
the
gulph
two
weeks
each
night
he
came
to
the
pasture
and
milked
one
of
my
cows
without
any
other
vessel
in
which
to
receive
the
milk
than
his
hat
out
of
which
he
drank
it
i
supplied
him
with
meal
but
fearing
to
build
a
fire
he
was
obliged
to
eat
it
raw
and
wash
it
down
with
the
milk
nettles
having
left
our
neighborhood
and
allen
considering
himself
safe
left
his
little
cave
and
came
home
i
gave
him
his
box
of
money
and
trinkets
and
he
went
to
his
own
house
at
mount
morris
it
was
generally
considered
by
the
indians
of
our
tribe
that
allen
was
an
innocent
man
and
that
the
niagara
people
were
persecuting
him
without
a
just
cause
little
beard
then
about
to
go
to
the
eastward
on
public
business
charged
his
indians
not
to
meddle
with
allen
but
to
let
him
live
amongst
them
peaceably
and
enjoy
himself
with
his
family
and
property
if
he
could
having
the
protection
of
the
chief
he
felt
himself
safe
and
let
his
situation
be
known
to
the
whites
from
whom
he
suspected
no
harm
they
however
were
more
inimical
than
our
indians
and
were
easily
bribed
by
nettles
to
assist
in
bringing
him
to
justice
nettles
came
on
and
the
whites
as
they
had
agreed
gave
poor
allen
up
to
him
he
was
bound
and
carried
to
niagara
where
he
was
confined
in
prison
through
the
winter
in
the
spring
he
was
taken
to
montreal
or
quebec
for
trial
and
was
honorably
acquitted
the
crime
for
which
he
was
tried
was
for
his
having
carried
the
wampum
to
the
americans
and
thereby
putting
too
sudden
a
stop
to
their
war
from
the
place
of
his
trial
he
went
directly
to
philadelphia
and
purchased
on
credit
a
boat
load
of
goods
which
he
brought
by
water
to
conhocton
where
he
left
them
and
came
to
mount
morris
for
assistance
to
get
them
brought
on
the
indians
readily
went
with
horses
and
brought
them
to
his
house
where
he
disposed
of
his
dry
goods
but
not
daring
to
let
the
indians
begin
to
drink
strong
liquor
for
fear
of
the
quarrels
which
would
naturally
follow
he
sent
his
spirits
to
my
place
and
we
sold
them
for
his
goods
he
received
ginseng
roots
principally
and
a
few
skins
ginseng
at
that
time
was
plenty
and
commanded
a
high
price
we
prepared
the
whole
that
he
received
for
the
market
expecting
that
he
would
carry
them
to
philadelphia
in
that
i
was
disappointed
for
when
he
had
disposed
of
and
got
pay
for
all
his
goods
he
took
the
ginseng
and
skins
to
niagara
and
there
sold
them
and
came
home
tired
of
dealing
in
goods
he
planted
a
large
field
of
corn
on
or
near
his
own
land
attended
to
it
faithfully
and
succeeded
in
raising
a
large
crop
which
he
harvested
loaded
into
canoes
and
carried
down
the
river
to
the
mouth
of
allen
creek
then
called
by
the
indians
where
he
unloaded
it
built
him
a
house
and
lived
with
his
family
the
next
season
he
planted
corn
at
that
place
and
built
a
grist
and
saw
mill
on
genesee
falls
now
called
rochester
at
the
time
allen
built
the
mills
he
had
an
old
german
living
with
him
by
the
name
of
andrews
whom
he
sent
in
a
canoe
down
the
river
with
his
mill
irons
allen
went
down
at
the
same
time
but
before
they
got
to
the
mills
allen
threw
the
old
man
overboard
and
drowned
him
as
it
was
then
generally
believed
for
he
was
never
seen
or
heard
of
afterwards
in
the
course
of
the
season
in
which
allen
built
his
mills
he
became
acquainted
with
the
daughter
of
a
white
man
who
was
moving
to
niagara
she
was
handsome
and
allen
soon
got
into
her
good
graces
so
that
he
married
and
took
her
home
to
be
a
joint
partner
with
sally
the
squaw
whom
she
had
never
heard
of
till
she
got
home
and
found
her
in
full
possession
but
it
was
too
late
for
her
to
retrace
the
hasty
steps
she
had
taken
for
her
father
had
left
her
in
the
care
of
a
tender
husband
and
gone
on
she
however
found
that
she
enjoyed
at
least
an
equal
half
of
her
husband
affections
and
made
herself
contented
her
name
i
have
forgotten
but
her
was
lucy
allen
was
not
contented
with
two
wives
for
in
a
short
time
after
he
had
married
lucy
he
came
up
to
my
house
where
he
found
a
young
woman
who
had
an
old
husband
with
her
they
had
been
on
a
long
journey
and
called
at
my
place
to
recruit
and
rest
themselves
she
filled
allen
eye
and
he
accordingly
fixed
upon
a
plan
to
get
her
into
his
possession
he
praised
his
situation
enumerated
his
advantages
and
finally
persuaded
them
to
go
home
and
tarry
with
him
a
few
days
at
least
and
partake
of
a
part
of
his
comforts
they
accepted
his
generous
invitation
and
went
home
with
him
but
they
had
been
there
but
two
or
three
days
when
allen
took
the
old
gentleman
out
to
view
his
flats
and
as
they
were
deliberately
walking
on
the
bank
of
the
river
pushed
him
into
the
water
the
old
man
almost
strangled
succeeded
in
getting
out
but
his
fall
and
exertions
had
so
powerful
an
effect
upon
his
system
that
he
died
in
two
or
three
days
and
left
his
young
widow
to
the
protection
of
his
murderer
she
lived
with
him
about
one
year
in
a
state
of
concubinage
and
then
left
him
how
long
allen
lived
at
allen
creek
i
am
unable
to
state
but
soon
after
the
young
widow
left
him
he
removed
to
his
old
place
at
mount
morris
and
built
a
house
where
he
made
sally
his
squaw
by
whom
he
had
two
daughters
a
slave
to
lucy
by
whom
he
had
had
one
son
still
however
he
considered
sally
to
be
his
wife
after
allen
came
to
mt
morris
at
that
time
he
married
a
girl
by
the
name
of
morilla
gregory
whose
father
at
the
time
lived
on
genesee
flats
the
ceremony
being
over
he
took
her
home
to
live
in
common
with
his
other
wives
but
his
house
was
too
small
for
his
family
for
sally
and
lucy
conceiving
that
their
lawful
privileges
would
be
abridged
if
they
received
a
partner
united
their
strength
and
whipped
poor
morilla
so
cruelly
that
he
was
obliged
to
keep
her
in
a
small
indian
house
a
short
distance
from
his
own
or
lose
her
entirely
morilla
before
she
left
mt
morris
had
four
children
one
of
morilla
sisters
lived
with
allen
about
a
year
after
morilla
was
married
and
then
quit
him
a
short
time
after
they
all
got
to
living
at
mt
morris
allen
prevailed
upon
the
chiefs
to
give
to
his
indian
children
a
tract
of
land
four
miles
square
where
he
then
resided
the
chiefs
gave
them
the
land
but
he
so
artfully
contrived
the
conveyance
that
he
could
apply
it
to
his
own
use
and
by
alienating
his
right
destroy
the
claim
of
his
children
having
secured
the
land
in
that
way
to
himself
he
sent
his
two
indian
girls
to
trenton
and
his
white
son
to
philadelphia
for
the
purpose
of
giving
each
of
them
a
respectable
english
education
while
his
children
were
at
school
he
went
to
philadelphia
and
sold
his
right
to
the
land
which
he
had
begged
of
the
indians
for
his
children
to
robert
morris
after
that
he
sent
for
his
daughters
to
come
home
which
they
did
having
disposed
of
the
whole
of
his
property
on
the
genesee
river
he
took
his
two
white
wives
and
their
children
together
with
his
effects
and
removed
to
a
delaware
town
on
the
river
de
trench
in
upper
canada
when
he
left
mt
morris
sally
his
squaw
insisted
upon
going
with
him
and
actually
followed
him
crying
bitterly
and
praying
for
his
protection
some
two
or
three
miles
till
he
absolutely
bade
her
leave
him
or
he
would
punish
her
with
severity
at
length
finding
her
case
hopeless
she
returned
to
the
indians
at
the
great
treaty
at
big
tree
one
of
allen
daughters
claimed
the
land
which
he
had
sold
to
morris
the
claim
was
examined
and
decided
against
her
in
favor
of
ogden
trumbull
rogers
and
others
who
were
the
creditors
of
robert
morris
allen
yet
believed
that
his
daughter
had
an
indisputable
right
to
the
land
in
question
and
got
me
to
go
with
mother
farly
a
half
indian
woman
to
assist
him
by
interceding
with
morris
for
it
and
to
urge
the
propriety
of
her
claim
we
went
to
thomas
morris
and
having
stated
to
him
our
business
he
told
us
plainly
that
he
had
no
land
to
give

that
as
the
title
was
good
he
never
would
allow
allen
nor
his
heirs
one
foot
or
words
to
that
effect
we
returned
to
allen
the
answer
we
had
received
and

conceiving
all
further
attempts
to
be
useless
went

soon
after

death
went
with
her
children
down
the

river
to
receive
assistance
from
her
friends
in
the
revolutionary
war
allen
was
a
tory
and
by
that
means
became
acquainted
with
our
indians
when
they
were
in
the
neighborhood
of
his
native
place
desolating
the
settlements
on
the
susquehannah
in
those
predatory
battles
he
joined
them
and
as
i
have
often
heard
the
indians
say
for
cruelty
was
not
exceeded
by
any
of
his
indian
comrades
at
one
time
when
he
was
scouting
with
the
indians
in
the
susquehannah
country
he
entered
a
house
very
early
in
the
morning
where
he
found
a
man
his
wife
and
one
child
in
bed
the
man
as
he
entered
the
door
instantly
sprang
on
the
floor
for
the
purpose
of
defending
himself
and
little
family
but
allen
dispatched
him
at
one
blow
he
then
cut
off
his
head
and
threw
it
bleeding
into
the
bed
with
the
terrified
woman
took
the
little
infant
from
its
mother
breast
and
holding
it
by
its
legs
dashed
its
head
against
the
jamb
and
left
the
unhappy
widow
and
mother
to
mourn
alone
over
her
murdered
family
it
has
been
said
by
some
that
after
he
had
killed
the
child
he
opened
the
fire
and
buried
it
under
the
coals
and
embers
but
of
that
i
am
not
certain
i
have
often
heard
him
speak
of
that
transaction
with
a
great
degree
of
sorrow
and
as
the
foulest
crime
he
had
ever
committed
one
for
which
i
have
no
doubt
he
repented

of

country
soon
after
the
close
of
the

war
my
indian
brother
which
being
interpreted
signifies
black
coals
offered
me
my
liberty
and
told
me
that
if
it
was
my
choice
i
might
go
to
my
friends
my
son
thomas
was
anxious
that
i
should
go
and
offered
to
go
with
me
and
assist
me
on
the
journey
by
taking
care
of
the
younger
children
and
providing
food
as
we
travelled
through
the
wilderness
but
the
chiefs
of
our
tribe
suspecting
from
his
appearance
actions
and
a
few
warlike
exploits
that
thomas
would
be
a
great
warrior
or
a
good
counsellor
refused
to
let
him
leave
them
on
any
account
whatever
to
go
myself
and
leave
him
was
more
than
i
felt
able
to
do
for
he
had
been
kind
to
me
and
was
one
on
whom
i
placed
great
dependence
the
chiefs
refusing
to
let
him
go
was
one
reason
for
my
resolving
to
stay
but
another
more
powerful
if
possible
was
that
i
had
got
a
large
family
of
indian
children
that
i
must
take
with
me
and
that
if
i
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
my
relatives
they
would
despise
them
if
not
myself
and
treat
us
as
enemies
or
at
least
with
a
degree
of
cold
indifference
which
i
thought
i
could
not
endure
accordingly
after
i
had
duly
considered
the
matter
i
told
my
brother
that
it
was
my
choice
to
stay
and
spend
the
remainder
of
my
days
with
my
indian
friends
and
live
with
my
family
as
i
had
heretofore
done
he
appeared
well
pleased
with
my
resolution
and
informed
me
that
as
that
was
my
choice
i
should
have
a
piece
of
land
that
i
could
call
my
own
where
i
could
live
unmolested
and
have
something
at
my
decease
to
leave
for
the
benefit
of
my
children
in
a
short
time
he
made
himself
ready
to
go
to
upper
canada
but
before
he
left
us
he
told
me
that
he
would
speak
to
some
of
the
chiefs
at
buffalo
to
attend
the
great
council
which
he
expected
would
convene
in
a
few
years
at
farthest
and
convey
to
me
such
a
tract
of
land
as
i
should
select
my
brother
left
us
as
he
had
proposed
and
soon
after
died
at
grand
river
kaujisestaugeau
was
an
excellent
man
and
ever
treated
me
with
kindness
perhaps
no
one
of
his
tribe
at
any
time
exceeded
him
in
natural
mildness
of
temper
and
warmth
and
tenderness
of
affection
if
he
had
taken
my
life
at
the
time
when
the
avarice
of
the
old
king
inclined
him
to
procure
my
emancipation
it
would
have
been
done
with
a
pure
heart
and
from
good
motives
he
loved
his
friends
and
was
generally
beloved
during
the
time
that
i
lived
in
the
family
with
him
he
never
offered
the
most
trifling
abuse
on
the
contrary
his
whole
conduct
towards
me
was
strictly
honorable
i
mourned
his
loss
as
that
of
a
tender
brother
and
shall
recollect
him
through
life
with
emotions
of
friendship
and
gratitude
i
lived
undisturbed
without
hearing
a
word
on
the
subject
of
my
land
till
the
great
council
was
held
at
big
tree
in
when
brother
whose
indian
name
is
sent
for
me
to
attend
the
council
when
i
got
there
he
told
me
that
my
brother
had
spoken
to
him
to
see
that
i
had
a
piece
of
land
reserved
for
my
use
and
that
then
was
the
time
for
me
to
receive
he
requested
that
i
would
choose
for
myself
and
describe
the
bounds
of
a
piece
that
would
suit
me
i
accordingly
told
him
the
place
of
beginning
and
then
went
round
a
tract
that
i
judged
would
be
sufficient
for
my
purpose
knowing
that
it
would
include
the
gardow
flats
by
stating
certain
bounds
with
which
i
was
acquainted
when
the
council
was
opened
and
the
business
afforded
a
proper
opportunity
farmer
brother
presented
my
claim
and
rehearsed
the
request
of
my
brother
red
jacket
whose
indian
name
is
which
interpreted
as
opposed
me
or
my
claim
with
all
his
influence
and
eloquence
farmer
brother
insisted
upon
the
necessity
propriety
and
expediency
of
his
proposition
and
got
the
land
granted
the
deed
was
made
and
signed
securing
to
me
the
title
to
all
the
land
i
had
described
under
the
same
restrictions
and
regulations
that
other
indian
lands
are
subject
to
that
land
has
ever
since
been
known
by
the
name
of
the
gardow
tract
red
jacket
not
only
opposed
my
claim
at
the
council
but
he
withheld
my
money
two
or
three
years
on
the
account
of
my
lands
having
been
granted
without
his
consent
parrish
and
jones
at
length
convinced
him
that
it
was
the
white
people
and
not
the
indians
who
had
given
me
the
land
and
compelled
him
to
pay
over
all
the
money
which
he
had
retained
on
my
account
my
land
derived
its
name
gardow
from
a
hill
that
is
within
its
limits
which
is
called
in
the
seneca
language
kautam
when
interpreted
signifies
up
and
down
or
down
and
up
and
is
applied
to
a
hill
that
you
will
ascend
and
descend
in
passing
it
or
to
a
valley
it
has
been
said
that
gardow
was
the
name
of
my
husband
hiokatoo
and
that
my
land
derived
its
name
from
him
that
however
was
a
mistake
for
the
old
man
always
considered
gardow
a
nickname
and
was
uniformly
offended
when
called
by
it
about
three
hundred
acres
of
my
land
when
i
first
saw
it
was
open
flats
lying
on
the
genesee
river
which
it
is
supposed
was
cleared
by
a
race
of
inhabitants
who
preceded
the
first
indian
settlements
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
indians
are
confident
that
many
parts
of
this
country
were
settled
and
for
a
number
of
years
occupied
by
people
of
whom
their
fathers
never
had
any
tradition
as
they
never
had
seen
them
whence
those
people
originated
and
whither
they
went
i
have
never
heard
one
of
our
oldest
and
wisest
indians
pretend
to
guess
when
i
first
came
to
genishau
the
bank
of
fall
brook
had
just
slid
off
and
exposed
a
large
number
of
human
bones
which
the
indians
said
were
buried
there
long
before
their
fathers
ever
saw
the
place
and
that
they
did
not
know
what
kind
of
people
they
were
it
however
was
and
is
believed
by
our
people
that
they
were
not
indians
my
flats
were
extremely
fertile
but
needed
more
labor
than
my
daughters
and
myself
were
able
to
perform
to
produce
a
sufficient
quantity
of
grain
and
other
necessary
productions
of
the
earth
for
the
consumption
of
our
family
the
land
had
lain
uncultivated
so
long
that
it
was
thickly
covered
with
weeds
of
almost
every
description
in
order
that
we
might
live
more
easy
parrish
with
the
consent
of
the
chiefs
gave
me
liberty
to
lease
or
my
land
to
white
people
to
till
on
shares
i
accordingly
let
it
out
and
have
continued
to
do
so
which
makes
my
task
less
burthensome
while
at
the
same
time
i
am
more
comfortably
supplied
with
the
means
of
support

i
have
frequently
heard
it
asserted
by
white
people
and
can
truly
say
from
my
own
experience
that
the
time
at
which
parents
take
the
most
satisfaction
and
comfort
with
their
families
is
when
their
children
are
young
incapable
of
providing
for
their
own
wants
and
are
about
the
fireside
where
they
can
be
daily
observed
and
instructed
few
mothers
perhaps
have
had
less
trouble
with
their
children
during
their
minority
than
myself
in
general
my
children
were
friendly
to
each
other
and
it
was
very
seldom
that
i
knew
them
to
have
the
least
difference
or
quarrel
so
far
indeed
were
they
from
rendering
themselves
or
me
uncomfortable
that
i
considered
myself
happy
more
so
than
commonly
falls
to
the
lot
of
parents
especially
to
women
my
happiness
in
this
respect
however
was
not
without
alloy
for
my
son
thomas
from
some
cause
unknown
to
me
from
the
time
he
was
a
small
lad
always
called
his
brother
john
a
witch
which
was
the
cause
as
they
grew
towards
manhood
of
frequent
and
severe
quarrels
between
them
and
gave
me
much
trouble
and
anxiety
for
their
safety
after
thomas
and
john
arrived
to
manhood
in
addition
to
the
former
charge
john
got
two
wives
with
whom
he
lived
till
the
time
of
his
death
although
polygamy
was
tolerated
in
our
tribe
thomas
considered
it
a
violation
of
good
and
wholesome
rules
in
society
and
tending
directly
to
destroy
that
friendly
social
intercourse
and
love
that
ought
to
be
the
happy
result
of
matrimony
and
chastity
consequently
he
frequently
reprimanded
john
by
telling
him
that
his
conduct
was
beneath
the
dignity
and
inconsistent
with
the
principles
of
good
indians
indecent
and
unbecoming
a
gentleman
and
as
he
never
could
reconcile
himself
to
it
he
was
frequently
almost
constantly
when
they
were
together
talking
to
him
on
the
same
subject
john
always
resented
such
reprimand
and
reproof
with
a
great
degree
of
passion
though
they
never
quarrelled
unless
thomas
was
intoxicated
in
his
fits
of
drunkenness
thomas
seemed
to
lose
all
his
natural
reason
and
to
conduct
like
a
wild
or
crazy
man
without
regard
to
relatives
decency
or
propriety
at
such
times
he
often
threatened
to
take
my
life
for
having
raised
a
witch
as
he
called
john
and
has
gone
so
far
as
to
raise
his
tomahawk
to
split
my
head
he
however
never
struck
me
but
on
john
account
he
struck
hiokatoo
and
thereby
excited
in
john
a
high
degree
of
indignation
which
was
extinguished
only
by
blood
for
a
number
of
years
their
difficulties
and
consequent
unhappiness
continued
and
rather
increased
continually
exciting
in
my
breast
the
most
fearful
apprehensions
and
greatest
anxiety
for
their
safety
with
tears
in
my
eyes
i
advised
them
to
become
reconciled
to
each
other
and
to
be
friendly
told
them
the
consequences
of
their
continuing
to
cherish
so
much
malignity
and
malice
that
it
would
end
in
their
destruction
the
disgrace
of
their
families
and
bring
me
down
to
the
grave
no
one
can
conceive
of
the
constant
trouble
that
i
daily
endured
on
their
account
on
the
account
of
my
two
oldest
sons
whom
i
loved
equally
and
with
all
the
feelings
and
affection
of
a
tender
mother
stimulated
by
an
anxious
concern
for
their
fate
parents
mothers
especially
will
love
their
children
though
ever
so
unkind
and
disobedient
their
eyes
of
compassion
of
real
sentimental
affection
will
be
involuntarily
extended
after
them
in
their
greatest
excesses
of
iniquity
and
those
fine
filaments
of
consanguinity
which
gently
entwine
themselves
around
the
heart
where
filial
love
and
parental
care
is
equal
will
be
lengthened
and
enlarged
to
cords
seemingly
of
sufficient
strength
to
reach
and
reclaim
the
wanderer
i
know
that
such
exercises
are
frequently
unavailing
but
notwithstanding
their
ultimate
failure
it
still
remains
true
and
ever
will
that
the
love
of
a
parent
for
a
disobedient
child
will
increase
and
grow
more
and
more
ardent
so
long
as
a
hope
of
its
reformation
is
capable
of
stimulating
a
disappointed
breast
my
advice
and
expostulations
with
my
sons
were
abortive
and
year
after
year
their
disaffection
for
each
other
increased
at
length
thomas
came
to
my
house
on
the
day
of
july
in
my
absence
somewhat
intoxicated
where
he
found
john
with
whom
he
immediately
commenced
a
quarrel
on
their
old
subjects
of
john
anger
became
desperate
he
caught
thomas
by
the
hair
of
his
head
dragged
him
out
at
the
door
and
there
killed
him
by
a
blow
which
he
gave
him
on
the
head
with
his
tomahawk
i
returned
soon
after
and
found
my
son
lifeless
at
the
door
on
the
spot
where
he
was
killed
no
one
can
judge
of
my
feelings
on
seeing
this
mournful
spectacle
and
what
greatly
added
to
my
distress
was
the
fact
that
he
had
fallen
by
the
murderous
hand
of
his
brother
i
felt
my
situation
unsupportable
having
passed
through
various
scenes
of
trouble
of
the
most
cruel
and
trying
kind
i
had
hoped
to
spend
my
few
remaining
days
in
quietude
and
to
die
in
peace
surrounded
by
my
family
this
fatal
event
however
seemed
to
be
a
stream
of
woe
poured
into
my
cup
of
afflictions
filling
it
even
to
overflowing
and
blasting
all
my
prospects
as
soon
as
i
had
recovered
a
little
from
the
shock
which
i
felt
at
the
sight
of
my
departed
son
and
some
of
my
neighbors
had
come
in
to
assist
in
taking
care
of
the
corpse
i
hired
shanks
an
indian
to
go
to
buffalo
and
carry
the
sorrowful
news
of
thomas
death
to
our
friends
at
that
place
and
request
the
chiefs
to
hold
a
council
and
dispose
of
john
as
they
should
think
proper
shanks
set
out
on
his
errand
immediately
and
john
fearing
that
he
should
be
apprehended
and
punished
for
the
crime
he
had
committed
at
the
same
time
went
off
towards
caneadea
thomas
was
decently
interred
in
a
style
corresponding
with
his
rank
the
chiefs
soon
assembled
in
council
on
the
trial
of
john
and
after
having
seriously
examined
the
matter
according
to
their
laws
justified
his
conduct
and
acquitted
him
they
considered
thomas
to
have
been
the
first
transgressor
and
that
for
the
abuses
which
he
had
offered
he
had
merited

he
had
received
john
on
learning
the
decision
of
the
council
returned
to
his
family
thomas
except
when
intoxicated
which
was
not
frequent
was
a
kind
and
tender
child
willing
to
assist
me
in
my
labor
and
to
remove
every
obstacle
to
my
comfort
his
natural
abilities
were
said
to
be
of
a
superior
cast
and
he
soared
above
the
trifling
subjects
of
revenge
which
are
common
amongst
indians
as
being
far
beneath
his
attention
in
his
childish
and
boyish
days
his
natural
turn
was
to
practise
in
the
art
of
war
though
he
despised
the
cruelties
that
the
warriors
inflicted
upon
their
subjugated
enemies
he
was
manly
in
his
deportment
courageous
and
active
and
commanded
respect
though
he
appeared
well
pleased
with
peace
he
was
cunning
in
indian
warfare
and
succeeded
to
admiration
in
the
execution
of
his
plans
at
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
years
he
went
into
the
war
with
manly
fortitude
armed
with
a
tomahawk
and
scalping
knife
and
when
he
returned
brought
one
white
man
a
prisoner
whom
he
had
taken
with
his
own
hands
on
the
west
branch
of
the
susquehannah
river
it
so
happened
that
as
he
was
looking
out
for
his
enemies
he
discovered
two
men
boiling
sap
in
the
woods
he
watched
them
unperceived
till
dark
when
he
advanced
with
a
noiseless
step
to
where
they
were
standing
caught
one
of
them
before
they
were
apprized
of
danger
and
conducted
him
to
the
camp
he
was
well
treated
while
a
prisoner
and
redeemed
at
the
close
of
the
war
at
the
time
kaujisestaugeau
gave
me
my
liberty
to
go
to
my
friends
thomas
was
anxious
to
go
with
me
but
as
i
have
before
observed
the
chiefs
would
not
suffer
him
to
leave
them
on
the
account
of
his
courage
and
skill
in
war
expecting
that
they
should
need
his
assistance
he
was
a
great
counsellor
and
a
chief
when
quite
young
and
in
the
last
capacity
went
two
or
three
times
to
philadelphia
to
assist
in
making
treaties
with
the
people
of
the

thomas
had
four

eight
children
jacob

his

who
is
at
this

or

of
age
went
to
dartmouth
college
in
the
spring
of
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
a
good
education
where
it
was
said
that
he
was
an
industrious
scholar
and
made
great
proficiency
in
the
study
of
the
different
branches
to
which
he
attended
having
spent
two
years
at
that
institution
he
returned
in
the
winter
of
and
is
now
at
buffalo
where
i
have
understood
that
he
contemplates
commencing
the
study
of
medicine
as
a
profession
thomas
at
the
time
he
was
killed
was
a
few
moons
over
years
old
and
john
was
as
he
was
naturally
good
natured
and
possessed
a
friendly
disposition
he
would
not
have
come
to
so
untimely
an
end
had
it
not
been
far
his
intemperance
he
fell
a
victim
to
the
use
of
ardent
spirits
a
poison
that
will
soon
exterminate
the
indian
tribes
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
leave
their
names
without
a
root
or
branch
the
thought
is
melancholy
but
no
arguments
no
examples
however
persuasive
or
impressive
are
sufficient
to
deter
an
indian
for
an
hour
from
taking
the
potent
draught
which
he
knows
at
the
time
will
derange
his
faculties
reduce
him

hiokatoo
was
an
old
man
when
i
first
saw
him
but
he
was
by
no
means
enervated
during
the
term
of
nearly
fifty
years
that
i
lived
with
him
i
received
according
to
indian
customs
all
the
kindness
and
attention
that
was
my
due
as
his
although
war
was
his
trade
from
his
youth
till
old
age
and
decrepitude
stopt
his
career
he
uniformly
treated
me
with
tenderness
and
never
offered
an
insult
i
have
frequently
heard
him
repeat
the
history
of
his
life
from
his
childhood
and
when
he
came
to
that
part
which
related
to
his
actions
his
bravery
and
his
valor
in
war
when
he
spoke
of
the
ambush
the
combat
the
spoiling
of
his
enemies
and
the
sacrifice
of
the
victims
his
nerves
seemed
strung
with
youthful
ardor
the
warmth
of
the
able
warrior
seemed
to
animate
his
frame
and
to
produce
the
heated
gestures
which
he
had
practised
in
middle
age
he
was
a
man
of
tender
feelings
to
his
friends
ready
and
willing
to
assist
them
in
distress
yet
as
a
warrior
his
cruelties
to
his
enemies
perhaps
were
unparalleled
and
will
not
admit
a
word
of
palliation
hiokatoo
was
born
in
one
of
the
tribes
of
the
six
nations
that
inhabited
the
banks
of
the
susquehannah
or
rather
he
belonged
to
a
tribe
of
the
senecas
that
made
at
the
time
of
the
great
indian
treaty
a
part
of
those
nations
he
was
own
cousin
to
farmer
brother
a
chief
who
has
been
justly
celebrated
for
his
worth
their
mothers
were
sisters
and
it
was
through
the
influence
of
farmer
brother
that
i
became
hiokatoo
wife
in
early
life
hiokatoo
showed
signs
of
thirst
for
blood
by
attending
only
to
the
art
of
war
in
the
use
of
the
tomahawk
and
scalping
knife
and
in
practising
cruelties
upon
every
thing
that
chanced
to
fall
into
his
hands
which
was
susceptible
of
pain
in
that
way
he
learned
to
use
his
implements
of
war
effectually
and
at
the
same
time
blunted
all
those
fine
feelings
and
tender
sympathies
that
are
naturally
excited
by
hearing
or
seeing
a
fellow
being
in
distress
he
could
inflict
the
most
excruciating
tortures
upon
his
enemies
and
prided
himself
upon
his
fortitude
in
having
performed
the
most
barbarous
ceremonies
and
tortures
without
the
least
degree
of
pity
or
remorse
thus
qualified
when
very
young
he
was
initiated
into
scenes
of
carnage
by
being
engaged
in
the
wars
that
prevailed
amongst
the
indian
tribes
in
the
year
he
was
appointed
a
runner
to
assist
in
collecting
an
army
to
go
against
the
cotawpes
cherokees
and
other
southern
indians
a
large
army
was
collected
and
after
a
long
and
fatiguing
march
met
its
enemies
in
what
was
then
called
the
low
dark
and
bloody
lands
near
the
mouth
of
red
river
in
what
is
now
called
the
state
of
kentucky
footnote
those
powerful
armies
met
near
the
place
that
is
now
called
clarksville
which
is
situated
at
the
fork
where
red
river
joins
the
cumberland
a
few
miles
above
the
line
between
kentucky
and
tennessee
the
cotawpes
footnote
the
author
acknowledges
himself
unacquainted
from
indian
history
with
a
nation
of
this
name
but
as
years
have
elapsed
since
the
date
of
this
occurrence
it
is
highly
probable
that
such
a
nation
did
exist
and
that
it
was
absolutely
exterminated
at
that
eventful
period
and
their
associates
had
by
some
means
been
apprized
of
their
approach
and
lay
in
ambush
to
take
them
at
once
when
they
should
come
within
their
reach
and
destroy
the
whole
army
the
northern
indians
with
their
usual
sagacity
discovered
the
situation
of
their
enemies
rushed
upon
the
ambuscade
and
massacred
on
the
spot
the
battle
continued
for
two
days
and
two
nights
with
the
utmost
severity
in
which
the
northern
indians
were
victorious
and
so
far
succeeded
in
destroying
the
cotawpes
that
they
at
that
time
ceased
to
be
a
nation
the
victors
suffered
an
immense
loss
in
killed
but
gained
the
hunting
ground
which
was
their
grand
object
though
the
cherokees
would
not
give
it
up
in
a
treaty
or
consent
to
make
peace
bows
and
arrows
at
that
time
were
in
general
use
though
a
few
guns
were
employed
from
that
time
he
was
engaged
in
a
number
of
battles
in
which
indians
only
were
engaged
and
that
made
fighting
his
business
till
the
commencement
of
the
french
war
in
those
battles
he
took
a
number
of
indians
prisoners
whom
he
killed
by
tying
them
to
trees
and
then
setting
small
indian
boys
to
shooting
at
them
with
arrows
till
death
finished
the
misery
of
the
sufferers
a
process
that
frequently
took
two
days
for
its
completion
during
the
french
war
he
was
in
every
battle
that
was
fought
on
the
susquehannah
and
ohio
rivers
and
was
so
fortunate
as
never
to
have
been
taken
prisoner
at
braddock
defeat
he
took
two
white
prisoners
and
burnt
them
alive
in
a
fire
of
his
own
kindling
in
he
was
in
the
battle
at
fort
freeland
in
northumberland
county
penn
the
fort
contained
a
great
number
of
women
and
children
and
was
defended
only
by
a
small
garrison
the
force
that
went
against
it
consisted
of
british
regulars
commanded
by
a
mcdonald
and
indians
under
hiokatoo
after
a
short
but
bloody
engagement
the
fort
was
surrendered
the
women
and
children
were
sent
under
an
escort
to
the
next
fort
below
and
the
men
and
boys
taken
off
by
a
party
of
british
to
the
general
indian
encampment
as
soon
as
the
fort
had
capitulated
and
the
firing
had
ceased
hiokatoo
with
the
help
of
a
few
indians
tomahawked
every
wounded
american
while
earnestly
begging
with
uplifted
hands
for
quarters
the
massacre
was
but
just
finished
when
capts
dougherty
and
boon
arrived
with
a
reinforcement
to
assist
the
garrison
on
their
arriving
in
sight
of
the
fort
they
saw
that
it
had
surrendered
and
that
an
indian
was
holding
the
flag
this
so
much
inflamed
capt
dougherty
that
he
left
his
command
stept
forward
and
shot
the
indian
at
the
first
fire
another
took
the
flag
and
had
no
sooner
got
it
erected
than
dougherty
dropt
him
as
he
had
the
first
a
third
presumed
to
hold
it
who
was
also
shot
down
by
dougherty
hiokatoo
exasperated
at
the
sight
of
such
bravery
sallied
out
with
a
party
of
his
indians
and
killed
capts
dougherty
boon
and
fourteen
men
at
the
first
fire
the
remainder
of
the
two
companies
escaped
by
taking
to
flight
and
soon
arrived
at
the
fort
which
they
had
left
but
a
few
hours
before
in
an
expedition
that
went
out
against
cherry
valley
and
the
neighboring
settlements
captain
david
a
mohawk
indian
was
first
and
hiokatoo
the
second
in
command
the
force
consisted
of
several
hundred
indians
who
were
determined
on
mischief
and
the
destruction
of
the
whites
a
continued
series
of
wantonness
and
barbarity
characterized
their
career
for
they
plundered
and
burnt
every
thing
that
came
in
their
way
and
killed
a
number
of
persons
among
whom
were
several
infants
whom
hiokatoo
butchered
or
dashed
upon
the
stones
with
his
own
hands
besides
the
instances
which
have
been
mentioned
he
was
in
a
number
of
parties
during
the
revolutionary
war
where
he
ever
acted
a
conspicuous
part
the
indians
having
removed
the
seat
of
their
depredations
and
war
to
the
frontiers
of
pennsylvania
ohio
kentucky
and
the
neighboring
territories
assembled
a
large
force
at
upper
sandusky
their
place
of
general
rendezvous
from
whence
they
went
out
to
the
various
places
which
they
designed
to
sacrifice
tired
of
the
desolating
scenes
that
were
so
often
witnessed
and
feeling
a
confidence
that
the
savages
might
be
subdued
and
an
end
put
to
their
crimes
the
american
government
raised
a
regiment
consisting
of
volunteers
for
the
purpose
of
dislodging
them
from
their
cantonment
and
preventing
further
barbarities
william
crawford
and
lieut
david
williamson
men
who
had
been
thoroughly
tried
and
approved
were
commissioned
by
washington
to
take
the
command
of
a
service
that
seemed
to
the
welfare
of
the
country
in
the
month
of
july
and
provided
with
a
sufficient
quantity
of
provision
this
regiment
made
an
expeditious
march
through
the
wilderness
to
upper
sandusky
where
as
had
been
anticipated
they
found
the
indians
assembled
in
full
force
at
their
encampment
prepared
to
receive
an
attack
as
crawford
and
his
brave
band
advanced
and
when
they
had
got
within
a
short
distance
from
the
town
they
were
met
by
a
white
man
with
a
flag
of
truce
from
the
indians
who
proposed
to
crawford
that
if
he
would
surrender
himself
and
his
men
to
the
indians
their
lives
should
be
spared
but
that
if
they
persisted
in
their
undertaking
and
attacked
the
town
they
should
all
be
massacred
to
a
man
crawford
while
hearing
the
proposition
attentively
surveyed
its
bearer
and
recognized
in
his
features
one
of
his
former
schoolmates
and
companions
with
whom
he
was
perfectly
acquainted
by
the
name
of
simon
gurty
gurty
but
a
short
time
before
this
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
american
army
in
the
same
regiment
with
crawford
but
on
the
account
of
his
not
having
received
the
promotion
that
he
expected
he
became
disaffected
swore
an
eternal
war
with
his
countrymen
fled
to
the
indians
and
joined
them
as
a
leader
well
qualified
to
conduct
them
to
where
they
could
satiate
their
thirst
for
blood
upon
the
innocent
unoffending
and
defenceless
settlers
crawford
sternly
inquired
of
the
traitor
if
his
name
was
not
simon
gurty
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
he
informed
him
that
he
despised
the
offer
which
he
had
made
and
that
he
would
not
surrender
his
army
unless
he
should
be
compelled
to
do
so
by
a
superior
force
gurty
returned
and
crawford
immediately
commenced
an
engagement
that
lasted
till
night
without
the
appearance
of
victory
on
either
side
when
the
firing
ceased
and
the
combatants
on
both
sides
retired
to
take
refreshment
and
to
rest
through
the
night
crawford
encamped
in
the
woods
near
half
a
mile
from
the
town
where
after
the
centinels
were
placed
and
each
had
taken
his
ration
they
slept
on
their
arms
that
they
might
be
instantly
ready
in
case
they
should
be
attacked
the
stillness
of
death
hovered
over
the
little
army
and
sleep
relieved
the
whole
except
the
wakeful
centinels
who
vigilantly
attended
to
their
but
what
was
their
surprise
when
they
found
late
in
the
night
that
they
were
surrounded
by
the
indians
on
every
side
except
a
narrow
space
between
them
and
the
town
every
man
was
under
arms
and
the
officers
instantly
consulted
each
other
on
the
best
method
of
escaping
for
they
saw
that
to
fight
would
be
useless
and
that
to
surrender
would
be
death
crawford
proposed
a
retreat
through
the
ranks
of
the
enemy
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
town
as
being
the
most
sure
course
to
take
williamson
advised
to
march
directly
through
the
town
where
there
appeared
to
be
no
indians
and
the
fires
were
yet
burning
there
was
no
time
or
place
for
debates
crawford
with
sixty
followers
retreated
on
the
route
that
he
had
proposed
by
attempting
to
rush
through
the
enemy
but
they
had
no
sooner
got
amongst
the
indians
than
every
man
was
killed
or
taken
prisoner
amongst
the
prisoners
were
crawford
and
doct
night
surgeon
of
the
regiment
williamson
with
the
remainder
of
the
regiment
together
with
the
wounded
set
out
at
the
same
time
that
crawford
did
went
through
the
town
without
losing
a
man
and
by
the
help
of
good
guides
arrived
at
their
homes
in
safety
the
next
day
after
the
engagement
the
indians
disposed
of
all
their
prisoners
to
the
different
tribes
except
crawford
and
doct
night
but
those
unfortunate
men
were
reserved
for
a
more
cruel
destiny
a
council
was
immediately
held
on
sandusky
plains
consisting
of
all
the
chiefs
and
warriors
ranged
in
their
customary
order
in
a
circular
form
and
crawford
and
night
were
brought
forward
and
seated
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
the
council
being
opened
the
chiefs
began
to
examine
crawford
on
various
subjects
relative
to
the
war
at
length
they
enquired
who
conducted
the
military
operations
of
the
american
army
on
the
ohio
and
susquehannah
rivers
during
the
year
before
and
who
had
led
that
army
against
them
with
so
much
skill
and
so
uniform
success
crawford
very
honestly
and
without
suspecting
any
harm
from
his
reply
promptly
answered
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
led
his
countrymen
to
victory
who
had
driven
the
enemy
from
the
settlements
and
by
that
means
had
procured
a
great
degree
of
happiness
to
many
of
his
upon
hearing
this
a
chief
who
had
lost
a
son
in
the
year
before
in
a
battle
where
colonel
crawford
commanded
left
his
station
in
the
council
stepped
to
crawford
blacked
his
face
and
at
the
same
time
told
him
that
the
next
day
he
should
be
burnt
the
council
was
immediately
dissolved
on
its
hearing
the
sentence
from
the
chief
and
the
prisoners
were
taken
off
the
ground
and
kept
in
custody
through
the
night
crawford
now
viewed
his
fate
as
sealed
and
despairing
of
ever
returning
to
his
home
or
his
country
only
dreaded
the
tediousness
of
death
as
commonly
inflicted
by
the
savages
and
earnestly
hoped
that
he
might
be
despatched
at
a
single
blow
early
the
next
morning
the
indians
assembled
at
the
place
of
execution
and
crawford
was
led
to
the
post
the
goal
of
savage
torture
to
which
he
was
fastened
the
post
was
a
stick
of
timber
placed
firmly
in
the
ground
having
an
arm
framed
in
at
the
top
and
extending
some
six
or
eight
feet
from
it
like
the
arm
of
a
sign
post
a
pile
of
wood
containing
about
two
cords
lay
a
few
feet
from
the
place
where
he
stood
which
he
was
informed
was
to
be
kindled
into
a
fire
that
would
burn
him
alive
as
many
had
been
burnt
on
the
same
spot
who
had
been
much
less
deserving
than
himself
gurty
stood
and
supposedly
looked
on
the
preparations
that
were
making
for
the
funeral
of
one
his
former
playmates
a
hero
by
whose
side
he
had
fought
of
a
man
whose
valor
had
won
laurels
which
if
he
could
have
returned
would
have
been
strewed
upon
his
grave
by
his
grateful
countrymen
dreading
the
agony
that
he
saw
he
was
about
to
feel
crawford
used
every
argument
which
his
perilous
situation
could
suggest
to
prevail
upon
gurty
to
ransom
him
at
any
price
and
deliver
him
as
it
was
in
his
power
from
the
savages
and
their
torments
gurty
heard
his
prayers
and
expostulations
and
saw
his
tears
with
indifference
and
finally
told
the
forsaken
victim
that
he
would
not
procure
him
a
moment
respite
nor
afford
him
the
most
trifling
assistance
the
was
then
bound
stripped
naked
and
tied
by
his
wrists
to
the
arm
which
extended
horizontally
from
the
post
in
such
a
manner
that
his
arms
were
extended
over
his
head
with
his
feet
just
standing
upon
the
ground
this
being
done
the
savages
placed
the
wood
in
a
circle
around
him
at
the
distance
of
a
few
feet
in
order
that
his
misery
might
be
protracted
to
the
greatest
length
and
then
kindled
it
in
a
number
of
places
at
the
same
time
the
flames
arose
and
the
scorching
heat
became
almost
insupportable
again
he
prayed
to
gurty
in
all
the
anguish
of
his
torment
to
rescue
him
from
the
fire
or
shoot
him
dead
upon
the
spot
a
demoniac
smile
suffused
the
countenance
of
gurty
while
he
calmly
replied
to
the
dying
suppliant
that
he
had
no
pity
for
his
sufferings
but
that
he
was
then
satisfying
that
spirit
of
revenge
which
for
a
long
time
he
had
hoped
to
have
an
opportunity
to
wreak
upon
him
nature
now
almost
exhausted
from
the
intensity
of
the
heat
he
settled
down
a
little
when
a
squaw
threw
coals
of
fire
and
embers
upon
him
which
made
him
groan
most
piteously
while
the
whole
camp
rung
with
exultation
during
the
execution
they
manifested
all
the
exstacy
of
a
complete
triumph
poor
crawford
soon
died
and
was
entirely
consumed
thus
ended
the
life
of
a
patriot
and
hero
who
had
been
an
intimate
with
washington
and
who
shared
in
an
eminent
degree
the
confidence
of
that
great
good
man
to
whom
in
the
time
of
revolutionary
perils
the
sons
of
legitimate
freedom
looked
with
a
degree
of
faith
in
his
mental
resources
unequalled
in
the
history
of
the
world
that
tragedy
being
ended
doct
night
was
informed
that
on
the
next
day
he
should
be
burnt
in
the
same
manner
that
his
comrade
crawford
had
been
at
lower
sandusky
hiokatoo
who
out
had
been
a
leading
chief
in
the
battle
with
and
in
the
execution
of
crawford
painted
doct
face
black
and
then
bound
and
gave
him
up
to
two
able
bodied
indians
to
conduct
to
the
place
of
execution
they
set
off
with
him
immediately
and
travelled
till
towards
evening
when
they
halted
to
encamp
till
morning
the
afternoon
had
been
very
rainy
and
the
storm
still
continued
which
rendered
it
very
difficult
for
the
indians
to
kindle
a
fire
night
observing
the
difficulty
under
which
they
labored
made
them
to
understand
by
signs
that
if
they
would
unbind
him
he
would
assist
they
accordingly
unbound
him
and
he
soon
succeeded
in
making
a
fire
by
the
application
of
small
dry
stuff
which
he
was
at
considerable
trouble
to
procure
while
the
indians
were
warming
themselves
the
doct
continued
to
gather
wood
to
last
through
the
night
and
in
doing
this
he
found
a
club
which
he
placed
in
a
situation
from
whence
he
could
take
it
conveniently
whenever
an
opportunity
should
present
itself
in
which
he
could
use
it
effectually
the
indians
continued
warming
till
at
length
the
doct
saw
that
they
had
placed
themselves
in
a
favorable
position
for
the
execution
of
his
design
when
stimulated
by
the
love
of
life
he
cautiously
took
his
club
and
at
two
blows
knocked
them
both
down
determined
to
finish
the
work
of
death
which
he
had
so
well
begun
he
drew
one
of
their
scalping
knives
with
which
he
beheaded
and
scalped
them
both
he
then
took
a
rifle
tomahawk
and
some
ammunition
and
directed
his
course
for
home
where
he
arrived
without
having
experienced
any
difficulty
on
his
journey
the
next
morning
the
indians
took
the
track
of
their
victim
and
his
attendants
to
go
to
lower
sandusky
and
there
execute
the
sentence
which
they
had
pronounced
upon
him
but
what
was
their
surprise
and
disappointment
when
they
arrived
at
the
place
of
encampment
where
they
found
their
trusty
friends
scalped
and
decapitated
and
that
their
prisoner
had
made
his
escape
chagrined
beyond
measure
they
immediately
separated
and
went
in
every
direction
in
pursuit
of
their
prey
but
after
having
spent
a
number
of
days
unsuccessfully
they
gave
up
the
chase
and
returned
to
their
encampment
footnote
i
have
understood
from
unauthenticated
sources
however
that
soon
after
the
revolutionary
war
doct
night
published
a
pamphlet
containing
an
account
of
the
battle
at
sandusky
and
of
his
own
sufferings
my
information
on
this
subject
was
derived
from
a
different
quarter
the
subject
of
this
narrative
in
giving
the
account
of
her
last
husband
hiokatoo
referred
us
to
george
jemison
who
as
it
will
be
noticed
lived
on
her
land
a
number
of
years
and
who
had
frequently
heard
the
old
chief
relate
the
story
of
his
life
particularly
that
part
which
related
to
his
military
career
jemison
on
being
enquired
of
gave
the
foregoing
account
partly
from
his
own
personal
knowledge
and
the
remainder
from
the
account
given
by
hiokatoo
jemison
was
in
the
battle
was
personally
acquainted
with
crawford
and
one
that
escaped
with
williamson
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
and
have
therefore
inserted
the
whole
account
as
an
addition
to
the
historical
facts
which
are
daily
coming
into
a
state
of
preservation
in
relation
to
the
american
revolution
author
in
the
time
of
the
french
war
in
an
engagement
that
took
place
on
the
ohio
river
hiokatoo
took
a
british
by
the
name
of
simon
canton
whom
he
carried
to
the
indian
encampment
a
council
was
held
and
the
was
sentenced
to
suffer
death
by
being
tied
on
a
wild
colt
with
his
face
towards
its
tail
and
then
having
the
colt
turned
loose
to
run
where
it
pleased
he
was
accordingly
tied
on
and
the
colt
let
loose
agreeable
to
the
sentence
the
colt
run
two
days
and
then
returned
with
its
rider
yet
alive
the
indians
thinking
that
he
would
never
die
in
that
way
took
him
off
and
made
him
run
the
gauntlet
three
times
but
in
the
last
race
a
squaw
knocked
him
down
and
he
was
supposed
to
have
been
dead
he
however
recovered
and
was
sold
for
fifty
dollars
to
a
frenchman
who
sent
him
as
a
prisoner
to
detroit
on
the
return
of
the
frenchman
to
detroit
the
besought
him
to
ransom
him
and
give
or
set
him
at
liberty
with
so
much
warmth
and
promised
with
so
much
solemnity
to
reward
him
as
one
of
the
best
of
benefactors
if
he
would
let
him
go
that
the
frenchman
took
his
word
and
sent
him
home
to
his
family
the
remembered
his
promise
and
in
a
short
time
sent
his
deliverer
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
as
a
reward
for
his
generosity
since
the
commencement
of
the
revolutionary
war
hiokatoo
has
been
in
seventeen
campaigns
four
of
which
were
in
the
cherokee
war
he
was
so
great
an
enemy
to
the
cherokees
and
so
fully
determined
upon
their
subjugation
that
on
his
march
to
their
country
he
raised
his
own
army
for
those
four
campaigns
and
commanded
it
and
also
superintended
its
subsistence
in
one
of
those
campaigns
which
continued
two
whole
years
without
intermission
he
attacked
his
enemies
on
the
mobile
drove
them
to
the
country
of
the
creek
nation
where
he
continued
to
harrass
them
till
being
tired
of
war
he
returned
to
his
family
he
brought
home
a
great
number
of
scalps
which
he
had
taken
from
the
enemy
and
ever
seemed
to
possess
an
unconquerable
will
that
the
cherokees
might
be
utterly
destroyed
towards
the
close
of
his
last
fighting
in
that
country
he
took
two
squaws
whom
he
sold
on
his
way
home
for
money
to
defray
the
expense
of
his
journey
hiokatoo
was
about
six
feet
four
or
five
inches
high
large
boned
and
rather
inclined
to
leanness
he
was
very
stout
and
active
for
a
man
of
his
size
for
it
was
said
by
himself
and
others
that
he
had
never
found
an
indian
who
could
keep
up
with
him
on
a
race
or
throw
him
at
wrestling
his
eye
was
quick
and
penetrating
and
his
voice
was
of
that
harsh
and
powerful
kind
which
amongst
indians
always
commands
attention
his
health
had
been
uniformly
good
he
never
was
confined
by
sickness
till
he
was
attacked
with
the
consumption
four
years
before
his
death
and
although
he
had
from
his
earliest
days
been
inured
to
almost
constant
fatigue
and
exposure
to
every
inclemency
of
the
weather
in
the
open
air
he
seemed
to
lose
the
vigor
of
the
prime
of
life
only
by
the
natural
decay
occasioned
by
old
age
chapter
xii
her
troubles
john
jealousy
towards
his
brother
circumstances
attending
the
murder
of
jesse
her
his
funeral
age
filial
kindness
being
now
left
a
widow
in
my
old
age
to
mourn
the
loss
of
a
husband
who
had
treated
me
well
and
with
whom
i
had
raised
five
children
and
having
suffered
the
loss
of
an
affectionate
son
i
fondly
fostered
the
hope
that
my
melancholy
vicissitudes
had
ended
and
that
the
remainder
of
my
time
would
be
characterized
by
nothing
unpropitious
my
children
dutiful
and
kind
lived
near
me
and
apparently
nothing
obstructed
our
happiness
but
a
short
time
however
elapsed
after
my
husband
death
before
my
troubles
were
renewed
with
redoubled
severity
john
hands
having
been
once
stained
in
the
blood
of
a
brother
it
was
not
strange
that
after
his
acquital
every
person
of
his
acquaintance
should
shun
him
from
a
fear
of
his
repeating
upon
them
the
same
ceremony
that
he
had
practised
upon
thomas
my
son
jesse
went
to
mt
morris
a
few
miles
from
home
on
business
in
the
winter
after
the
death
of
his
father
and
it
so
happened
that
his
brother
john
was
there
who
requested
jesse
to
come
home
with
him
jesse
fearing
that
john
would
commence
a
quarrel
with
him
on
the
way
declined
the
invitation
and
tarried
over
night
from
that
time
john
conceived
himself
despised
by
jesse
and
was
highly
enraged
at
the
treatment
which
he
had
received
very
little
was
said
however
and
it
all
passed
off
apparently
till
sometime
in
the
month
of
may
at
which
time
robert
whaley
who
lived
in
the
town
of
castile
within
four
miles
of
me
came
to
my
house
early
on
monday
morning
to
hire
george
chongo
my
and
john
and
jesse
to
go
that
day
and
help
him
slide
a
quantity
of
boards
from
the
top
of
the
hill
to
the
river
where
he
calculated
to
build
a
raft
of
them
for
market
they
all
concluded
to
go
with
whaley
and
made
ready
as
soon
as
possible
but
before
they
set
out
i
charged
them
not
to
drink
any
whiskey
for
i
was
confident
that
if
they
did
they
would
surely
have
a
quarrel
in
consequence
of
it
they
went
and
worked
till
almost
night
when
a
quarrel
ensued
between
chongo
and
jesse
in
consequence
of
the
whiskey
that
they
had
drank
through
the
day
which
terminated
in
a
battle
and
chongo
got
whipped
when
jesse
had
got
through
with
chongo
he
told
whaley
that
he
would
go
home
and
directly
went
off
he
however
went
but
a
few
rods
before
he
stopped
and
lay
down
by
the
side
of
a
log
to
wait
as
was
supposed
for
company
john
as
soon
as
jesse
was
gone
went
to
whaley
with
his
knife
in
his
hand
and
bade
him
jogo
be
gone
at
the
same
time
telling
him
that
jesse
was
a
bad
man
whaley
seeing
that
his
countenance
was
changed
and
that
he
was
determined
upon
something
desperate
was
alarmed
for
his
own
safety
and
turned
towards
home
leaving
chongo
on
the
ground
drunk
near
to
where
jesse
had
lain
who
by
this
time
had
got
up
and
was
advancing
towards
john
whaley
was
soon
out
of
hearing
of
them
but
some
of
his
workmen
staid
till
it
was
dark
jesse
came
up
to
john
and
said
to
him
you
want
more
whiskey
and
more
fighting
and
after
a
few
words
went
at
him
to
try
in
the
first
place
to
get
away
his
knife
in
this
he
did
not
succeed
and
they
parted
by
this
time
the
night
had
come
on
and
it
was
dark
again
they
clenched
and
at
length
in
their
struggle
they
both
fell
john
having
his
knife
in
his
hand
came
under
and
in
that
situation
gave
jesse
a
fatal
stab
with
his
knife
and
repeated
the
blows
till
jesse
cried
out
brother
you
have
killed
me
quit
his
hold
and
settled
back
upon
the
ground
upon
hearing
this
john
left
him
and
came
to
thomas
house
told
them
that
he
had
been
fighting
with
their
uncle
whom
he
had
killed
and
showed
them
his
knife
next
morning
as
soon
as
it
was
light
thomas
and
john
children
came
and
told
me
that
jesse
was
dead
in
the
woods
and
also
informed
me
how
he
came
by
his
death
john
soon
followed
them
and
informed
me
himself
of
all
that
had
taken
place
between
him
and
his
brother
and
seemed
to
be
somewhat
sorrowful
for
his
conduct
you
can
better
imagine
what
my
feelings
were
than
i
can
describe
them
my
darling
son
my
youngest
child
him
on
whom
i
depended
was
dead
and
i
in
my
old
age
left
destitute
of
a
helping
hand
as
soon
as
it
was
consistent
for
me
i
got
george
jemison
of
whom
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
to
go
with
his
sleigh
to
where
jesse
was
and
bring
him
home
a
distance
of
or
miles
my
daughter
polly
arrived
at
the
fatal
spot
first
we
got
there
soon
after
her
though
i
went
the
whole
distance
on
foot
by
this
time
chongo
who
was
left
on
the
ground
drunk
the
night
before
had
become
sober
and
sensible
of
the
great
misfortune
which
had
happened
to
our
family
i
was
overcome
with
grief
at
the
sight
of
my
murdered
son
and
so
far
lost
the
command
of
myself
as
to
be
almost
frantic
and
those
who
were
present
were
obliged
to
hold
me
from
going
near
him
on
examining
the
body
it
was
found
that
it
had
received
eighteen
wounds
so
deep
and
large
that
it
was
believed
that
either
of
them
would
have
proved
mortal
the
corpse
was
carried
to
my
house
and
kept
till
the
thursday
following
when
it
was
buried
after
the
manner
of
burying
white
people
jesse
was
or
eight
years
old
when
he
was
killed
his
temper
had
been
uniformly
very
mild
and
friendly
and
he
was
inclined
to
copy
after
the
white
people
both
in
his
manners
and
dress
although
he
was
naturally
temperate
he
occasionally
became
intoxicated
but
never
was
quarrelsome
or
mischievous
with
the
white
people
he
was
intimate
and
learned
from
them
their
habits
of
industry
which
he
was
fond
of
practising
especially
when
my
comfort
demanded
his
labor
as
i
have
observed
it
is
the
custom
amongst
the
indians
for
the
women
to
perform
all
the
labor
in
and
out
of
doors
and
i
had
the
whole
to
do
with
the
help
of
my
daughters
till
jesse
arrived
to
a
sufficient
age
to
assist
us
he
was
disposed
to
labor
in
the
cornfield
to
chop
my
wood
milk
my
cows
and
attend
to
any
kind
of
business
that
would
make
my
task
the
lighter
on
the
account
of
his
having
been
my
youngest
child
and
so
willing
to
help
me
i
am
sensible
that
i
loved
him
better
than
i
did
either
of
my
other
children
after
he
began
to
understand
my
situation
and
the
means
of
rendering
it
more
easy
i
never
wanted
for
anything
that
was
in
his
power
to
bestow
but
since
his
death
as
i
have
had
all
my
labor
to
perform
alone
i
have
constantly
seen
hard
times
jesse
shunned
the
company
of
his
brothers
and
the
indians
generally
and
never
attended
their
frolics
and
it
was
supposed
that
this
together
with
my
partiality
for
him
were
the
causes
which
excited
in
john
so
great
a
degree
of
envy
that
nothing
short
of
death
would
satisfy
it
chapter
xiii
jemison
is
informed
that
she
has
a
cousin
in
the
neighborhood
by
the
name
of
george
his
her
his
her
trouble
from
land
her
cousin
moves
off
a
year
or
two
before
the
death
of
my
husband
capt
jones
sent
me
word
that
a
cousin
of
mine
was
then
living
in
leicester
a
few
miles
from
gardow
by
the
name
of
george
jemison
and
as
he
was
very
poor
thought
it
advisable
for
me
to
go
and
see
him
and
take
him
home
to
live
with
me
on
my
land
my
indian
friends
were
pleased
to
hear
that
one
of
my
relatives
was
so
near
and
also
advised
me
to
send
for
him
and
his
family
immediately
i
accordingly
had
him
and
his
family
moved
into
one
of
my
houses
in
the
month
of
march
he
said
that
he
was
my
father
brother
son
that
his
father
did
not
leave
europe
till
after
the
french
war
in
america
and
that
when
he
did
come
over
he
settled
in
pennsylvania
where
he
died
george
had
no
personal
knowledge
of
my
father
but
from
information
was
confident
that
the
relationship
which
he
claimed
between
himself
and
me
actually
existed
although
i
had
never
before
heard
of
my
father
having
had
but
one
brother
him
who
was
killed
at
fort
necessity
yet
i
knew
that
he
might
have
had
others
and
as
the
story
of
george
carried
with
it
a
probability
that
it
was
true
i
received
him
as
a
kinsman
and
treated
him
with
every
degree
of
friendship
which
his
situation
demanded
footnote
jemison
is
now
confident
that
george
jemison
is
not
her
cousin
and
thinks
that
he
claimed
the
relationship
only
to
gain
assistance
but
the
old
gentleman
who
is
now
living
is
certain
that
his
and
her
father
were
brothers
as
before
stated
i
found
that
he
was
destitute
of
the
means
of
subsistence
and
in
debt
to
the
amount
of
seventy
dollars
without
the
ability
to
pay
one
cent
he
had
no
cow
and
finally
was
completely
poor
i
paid
his
debts
to
the
amount
of
dollars
and
bought
him
a
cow
for
which
i
paid
twenty
dollars
and
a
sow
and
pigs
that
i
paid
eight
dollars
for
i
also
paid
sixteen
dollars
for
pork
that
i
gave
him
and
furnished
him
with
other
provisions
and
furniture
so
that
his
family
was
comfortable
as
he
was
destitute
of
a
team
i
furnished
him
with
one
and
also
supplied
him
with
tools
for
farming
in
addition
to
all
this
i
let
him
have
one
of
thomas
cows
for
two
seasons
my
only
object
in
mentioning
his
poverty
and
the
articles
with
which
i
supplied
him
is
to
show
how
ungrateful
a
person
can
be
for
favors
and
how
soon
a
kind
benefactor
will
to
all
appearance
be
forgotten
thus
furnished
with
the
necessary
implements
of
husbandry
a
good
team
and
as
much
land
as
he
could
till
he
commenced
farming
on
my
flats
and
for
some
time
labored
well
at
length
however
he
got
an
idea
that
if
he
could
become
the
owner
of
a
part
of
my
reservation
he
could
live
more
easy
and
certainly
be
more
rich
and
accordingly
set
himself
about
laying
a
plan
to
obtain
it
in
the
easiest
manner
possible
i
supported
jemison
and
his
family
eight
years
and
probably
should
have
continued
to
have
done
so
to
this
day
had
it
not
been
for
the
occurrence
of
the
following
circumstance
when
he
had
lived
with
me
some
six
or
seven
years
a
friend
of
mine
told
me
that
as
jemison
was
my
cousin
and
very
poor
i
ought
to
give
him
a
piece
of
land
that
he
might
have
something
whereon
to
live
that
he
would
call
his
own
my
friend
and
jemison
were
then
together
at
my
house
prepared
to
complete
a
bargain
i
asked
how
much
land
he
wanted
jemison
said
that
he
should
be
glad
to
receive
his
old
field
as
he
called
it
containing
about
fourteen
acres
and
a
new
one
that
contained
i
observed
to
them
that
as
i
was
incapable
of
transacting
business
of
that
nature
i
would
wait
till
thomas
clute
a
neighbor
on
whom
i
depended
should
return
from
albany
before
i
should
do
any
thing
about
it
to
this
jemison
replied
that
if
i
waited
till
clute
returned
he
should
not
get
the
land
at
all
and
appeared
very
anxious
to
have
the
business
closed
without
delay
on
my
part
i
felt
disposed
to
give
him
some
land
but
knowing
my
ignorance
of
writing
feared
to
do
it
alone
lest
they
might
include
as
much
land
they
pleased
without
my
knowledge
they
then
read
the
deed
which
my
friend
had
prepared
before
he
came
from
home
describing
a
piece
of
land
by
certain
bounds
that
were
a
specified
number
of
chains
and
links
from
each
other
not
understanding
the
length
of
a
chain
or
link
i
described
the
bounds
of
a
piece
of
land
that
i
intended
jemison
should
have
which
they
said
was
just
the
same
that
the
deed
contained
and
no
more
i
told
them
that
the
deed
must
not
include
a
lot
that
was
called
the
steele
place
and
they
assured
me
that
it
did
not
upon
this
putting
confidence
in
them
both
i
signed
the
deed
to
george
jemison
containing
and
conveying
to
him
as
i
supposed
forty
acres
of
land
the
deed
being
completed
they
charged
me
never
to
mention
the
bargain
which
i
had
then
made
to
any
person
because
if
i
did
they
said
it
would
spoil
the
contract
the
whole
matter
was
afterwards
disclosed
when
it
was
found
that
that
deed
instead
of
containing
only
forty
acres
contained
four
hundred
and
that
one
half
of
it
actually
belonged
to
my
friend
as
it
had
been
given
to
him
by
jemison
as
a
reward
for
his
trouble
in
procuring
the
deed
in
the
fraudulent
manner
above
mentioned
my
friend
however
by
the
advice
of
some
well
disposed
people
awhile
afterwards
gave
up
his
claim
but
jemison
held
his
till
he
sold
it
for
a
trifle
to
a
gentleman
in
the
south
part
of
genesee
county
sometime
after
the
death
of
my
son
thomas
one
of
his
sons
went
to
jemison
to
get
the
cow
that
i
had
let
him
have
two
years
but
jemison
refused
to
let
her
go
and
struck
the
boy
so
violent
a
blow
as
to
almost
kill
him
jemison
then
run
to
jellis
clute
esq
to
procure
a
warrant
to
take
the
boy
but
young
king
an
indian
chief
went
down
to
squawky
hill
to
esq
clute
and
settled
the
affair
by
jemison
agreeing
never
to
use
that
club
again
having
satisfactorily
found
out
the
friendly
disposition
of
my
cousin
towards
me
i
got
him
off
my
premises

soon

at
my
expence
another
event
of
a
much
more
serious
nature
occurred
which
added
greatly
to
my
afflictions
and
consequently
destroyed
at

a
part
of
the
happiness
that
i
had
anticipated
was
laid
up
in
the
archives
of
providence
to
be
dispensed
on
my
old
age
my
son
john
was
a
doctor
considerably
celebrated
amongst
the
indians
of
various
tribes
for
his
skill
in
curing
their
diseases
by
the
administration
of
roots
and
herbs
which
he
gathered
in
the
forests
and
other
places
where
they
had
been
planted
by
the
hand
of
nature
in
the
month
of
april
or
first
of
may
he
was
called
upon
to
go
to
buffalo
cattaraugus
and
allegany
to
cure
some
who
were
sick
he
went
and
was
absent
about
two
months
when
he
returned
he
observed
the
great
slide
of
the
bank
of
genesee
river
a
short
distance
above
my
house
which
had
taken
place
during
his
absence
and
conceiving
that
circumstance
to
be
ominous
of
his
own
death
called
at
his
sister
nancy
told
her
that
he
should
live
but
a
few
days
and
wept
bitterly
at
the
near
approach
of
his
dissolution
nancy
endeavored
to
persuade
him
that
his
trouble
was
imaginary
and
that
he
ought
not
to
be
affected
by
a
fancy
which
was
visionary
her
arguments
were
ineffectual
and
afforded
no
alleviation
to
his
mental
sufferings
from
his
sister
he
went
to
his
own
house
where
he
stayed
only
two
nights
and
then
went
to
squawky
hill
to
procure
money
with
which
to
purchase
flour
for
the
use
of
his
family
while
at
squawky
hill
he
got
into
the
company
of
two
squawky
hill
indians
whose
names
were
doctor
and
jack
with
whom
he
drank
freely
and
in
the
afternoon
had
a
desperate
quarrel
in
which
his
opponents
as
it
was
afterwards
understood
agreed
to
kill
him
the
quarrel
ended
and
each
appeared
to
be
friendly
john
bought
some
spirits
of
which
they
all
drank
and
then
set
out
for
home
john
and
an
allegany
indian
were
on
horseback
and
doctor
and
jack
were
on
foot
it
was
dark
when
they
set
out
they
had
not
proceeded
far
when
doctor
and
jack
commenced
another
quarrel
with
john
clenched
and
dragged
him
off
his
horse
and
then
with
a
stone
gave
him
so
severe
a
blow
on
his
head
that
some
of
his
brains
were
discharged
from
the
wound
the
allegany
indian
fearing
that
his
turn
would
come
next
fled
for
safety
as
fast
as
possible
john
recovered
a
little
from
the
shock
he
had
received
and
endeavored
to
get
to
an
old
hut
that
stood
near
but
they
caught
him
and
with
an
axe
cut
his
throat
and
beat
out
his
brains
so
that
when
he
was
found
the
contents
of
his
skull
were
lying
on
his
arms
some
squaws
who
heard
the
uproar
ran
to
find
out
the
cause
of
it
but
before
they
had
time
to
offer
their
assistance
the
murderers
drove
them
into
a
house
and
threatened
to
take
their
lives
if
they
did
not
stay
there
or
if
they
made
any
noise
next
morning
esq
clute
sent
me
word
that
john
was
dead
and
also
informed
me
of
the
means
by
which
his
life
was
taken
a
number
of
people
went
from
gardow
to
where
the
body
lay
and
doct
levi
brundridge
brought
it
up
home
where
the
funeral
was
attended
after
the
manner
of
the
white
people
benjamin
luther
and
william
wiles
preached
a
sermon
and
performed
the
funeral
services
and
myself
and
family
followed
the
corpse
to
the
grave
as
mourners
i
had
now
buried
my
three
sons
who
had
been
snatched
from
me
by
the
hands
of
violence
when
i
least
expected
it
although
john
had
taken
the
life
of
his
two
brothers
and
caused
me
unspeakable
trouble
and
grief
his
death
made
a
solemn
impression
upon
my
mind
and
seemed
in
addition
to
my
former
misfortunes
enough
to
bring
down
my
grey
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
yet
on
a
second
thought
i
could
not
mourn
for
him
as
i
had
for
my
other
sons
because
i
knew
that
his
death
was
just
and
what
he
had
deserved
for
a
long
time
from
the
hand
of
justice
john
vices
were
so
great
and
so
aggravated
that
i
have
nothing
to
say
in
his
favor
yet
as
a
mother
i
pitied
him
while
he
lived
and
have
ever
felt
a
great
degree
of
sorrow
for
him
because
of
his
bad
conduct
from
his
childhood
he
carried
something
in
his
features
indicative
of
an
evil
disposition
that
would
result
in
the
perpetration
of
enormities
of
some
kind
and
it
was
the
opinion
and
saying
of
ebenezer
allen
that
he
would
be
a
bad
man
and
be
guilty
of
some
crime
deserving
of
death
there
is
no
doubt
but
what
the
thoughts
of
murder
rankled
in
his
breast
and
disturbed
his
mind
even
in
his
sleep
for
he
dreamed
that
he
had
killed
thomas
for
a
trifling
offence
and
thereby
forfeited
his
own
life
alarmed
at
the
revelation
and
fearing
that
he
might
in
some
unguarded
moment
destroy
his
brother
he
went
to
the
black
chief
to
whom
he
told
the
dream
and
expressed
his
fears
that
the
vision
would
be
verified
having
related
the
dream
together
with
his
feelings
on
the
subject
he
asked
for
the
best
advice
that
his
old
friend
was
capable
of
giving
to
prevent
so
sad
an
event
the
black
chief
with
his
usual
promptitude
told
him
that
from
the
nature
of
the
dream
he
was
fearful
that
something
serious
would
take
place
between
him
and
thomas
and
advised
him
by
all
means
to
govern
his
temper
and
avoid
any
quarrel
which
in
future
he
might
see
arising
especially
if
thomas
was
a
party
john
however
did
not
keep
the
good
counsel
of
the
chief
for
soon
after
he
killed
thomas
as
i
have
related
john
left
two
wives
with
whom
he
had
lived
at
the
same
time
and
raised
nine
children
his
widows
are
now
living
at
caneadea
with
their
father
and
keep
their
children
with
and
near
them
his
children
are
tolerably
white
and
have
got
light
colored
hair
john
died
about
the
last
day
of
june
aged
years
doctor
and
jack
having
finished
their
murderous
design
fled
before
they
could
be
apprehended
and
lay
six
weeks
in
the
woods
back
of
canisteo
they
then
returned
and
sent
me
some
wampum
by
chongo
my
and
that
is
big
kettle
expecting
that
i
would
pardon
them
and
suffer
them
to
live
as
they
had
done
with
their
tribe
i
however
would
not
accept
their
wampum
but
returned
it
with
a
request
that
rather
than
have
them
killed
they
would
run
away
and
keep
out
of
danger
on
their
receiving
back
the
wampum
they
took
my
advice
and
prepared
to
leave
their
country
and
people
immediately
their
relatives
accompanied
them
a
short
distance
on
their
journey
and
when
about
to
part
their
old
uncle
the
tall
chief
addressed
them
in
the
following
pathetic
and
sentimental
speech
friends
hear
my
voice
when
the
great
spirit
made
indians
he
made
them
all
good
and
gave
them
good
good
rivers
well
stored
with
fish
good
forests
filled
with
game
and
good
bows
and
arrows
but
very
soon
each
wanted
more
than
his
share
and
indians
quarrelled
with
indians
and
some
were
killed
and
others
were
wounded
then
the
great
spirit
made
a
very
good
word
and
put
it
in
every
indians
breast
to
tell
us
when
we
have
done
good
or
when
we
have
done
bad
and
that
word
has
never
told
a
lie
friends
whenever
you
have
stole
or
got
drunk
or
lied
that
good
word
has
told
you
that
you
were
bad
indians
and
made
you
afraid
of
good
indians
and
made
you
ashamed
and
look
down
friends
your
crime
is
greater
than
all
those
you
have
killed
an
indian
in
a
time
of
peace
and
made
the
wind
hear
his
groans
and
the
earth
drink
his
blood
you
are
bad
indians
yes
you
are
very
bad
indians
and
what
can
you
do
if
you
go
into
the
woods
to
live
alone
the
ghost
of
john
jemison
will
follow
you
crying
blood
blood
and
will
give
you
no
peace
if
you
go
to
the
land
of
your
nation
there
that
ghost
will
attend
you
and
say
to
your
relatives
see
my
murderers
if
you
plant
it
will
blast
your
corn
if
you
hunt
it
will
scare
your
game
and
when
you
are
asleep
its
groans
and
the
sight
of
an
avenging
tomahawk
will
awake
you
what
can
you
do
deserving
of
death
you
can
not
live
here
and
to
fly
from
your
country
to
leave
all
your
relatives
and
to
abandon
all
that
you
have
known
to
be
pleasant
and
dear
must
be
keener
than
an
arrow
more
bitter
than
gall
more
terrible
than
death
and
how
must
we
feel
your
path
will
be
muddy
the
woods
will
be
dark
the
lightnings
will
glance
down
the
trees
by
your
side
and
you
will
start
at
every
sound
peace
has
left
you
and
you
must
be
wretched
friends
hear
me
and
take
my
advice
return
with
us
to
your
homes
offer
to
the
great
spirit
your
best
wampum
and
try
to
be
good
indians
and
if
those
whom
you
have
bereaved
shall
claim
your
lives
as
their
only
satisfaction
surrender
them
cheerfully
and
die
like
good
indians
and
here
jack
highly
incensed
interrupted
the
old
man
and
bade
him
stop
speaking
or
he
would
take
his
life
affrighted
at
the
appearance
of
so
much
desperation
the
company
hastened
towards
home
and
left
doctor
and
jack
to
consult
their
own
feelings
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
jack
said
to
doctor
i
had
rather
die
here
than
leave
my
country
and
friends
put
the
muzzle
of
your
rifle
into
my
mouth
and
i
will
put
the
muzzle
of
mine
into
yours
and
at
a
given
signal
we
will
discharge
them
and
rid
ourselves
at
once
of
all
the
troubles
under
which
we
now
labor
and
satisfy
the
claims
which
justice
holds
against
us
doctor
heard
the
proposition
and
after
a
moment
pause
made
the
following
reply
i
am
as
sensible
as
you
can
be
of
the
unhappy
situation
in
which
we
have
placed
ourselves
we
are
bad
indians
we
have
forfeited
our
lives
and
must
expect
in
some
way
to
atone
for
our
crime
but
because
we
are
bad
and
miserable
shall
we
make
ourselves
worse
if
we
were
now
innocent
and
in
a
calm
reflecting
moment
should
kill
ourselves
that
act
would
make
us
bad
and
deprive
us
of
our
share
of
the
good
hunting

our

jack
withdrew
his
proposal
they
went
on
about
two
miles
and
then
turned
about
and
came
home
guilty
and
uneasy
they
lurked
about
squawky
hill
near
a
fortnight
and
then
went
to
cattaraugus

were
gone
six
weeks

they
came

earnestly
requested
him
to
remove
his
family
to
tonnewonta
but
he
remonstrated
against
her
project
and
utterly
declined
going
his
wife
and
family
however
tired
of
the
tumult
by
which
they
were
surrounded
packed
up
their
effects
in
spite
of
what
he
could
say
and
went
off
jack
deliberated
a
short
time
upon
the
proper
course
for
himself
to
pursue
and
finally
rather
than
leave
his
old
home
he
ate
a
large
quantity
of
muskrat
root
and
died
in

hours

of

ontario

was
recommended
to
me
as
it
was
said
by
a
ingles
to
be
a
man
of
candor
honesty
and
integrity
who
would
by
no
means
cheat
me
out
of
a
cent
brooks
soon
after
came
to
my
house
and
informed
me
that
he
was
disposed
to
assist
me
in
regard
to
my
land
by
procuring
a
legislative
act
that
would
invest
me
with
full
power
to
dispose
of
it
for
my
own
benefit
and
give
as
ample
a
title
as
could
be
given
by
any
citizen
of
the
state
he
observed
that
as
it
was
then
situated
it
was
of
but
little
value
because
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
dispose
of
it
let
my
necessities
be
ever
so
great
he
then
proposed
to
take
the
agency
of
the
business
upon
himself
and
to
get
the
title
of
one
half
of
my
reservation
vested
in
me
personally
upon
the
condition
that
as
a
reward
for
his
services
i
would
give
him
the
other
half
i
sent
for
my
son
john
who
on
being
consulted
objected
to
my
going
into
any
bargain
with
brooks
without
the
advice
and
consent
of
thomas
clute
who
then
lived
on
my
land
and
near
me
clute
was
accordingly
called
on
to
whom
brooks
repeated
his
former
statement
and
added
that
he
would
get
an
act
passed
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
would
invest
me
with
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
a
citizen
so
far
as
it
respected
my
property
clute
suspecting
that
some
plan
was
in
operation
that
would
deprive
me
of
my
possessions
advised
me
to
have
nothing
to
say
on
the
subject
to
brooks
till
i
had
seen
esquire
clute
of
squawky
hill
soon
after
this
thomas
clute
saw
esq
clute
who
informed
him
that
the
petition
for
my
naturalization
would
be
presented
to
the
legislature
of
this
state
instead
of
being
sent
to
congress
and
that
the
object
would
succeed
to
his
and
my
satisfaction
clute
then
observed
to
his
brother
esq
clute
that
as
the
sale
of
indian
lands
which
had
been
reserved
belonged
exclusively
to
the
united
states
an
act
of
the
legislature
of
could
have
no
effect
in
securing
to
me
a
title
to
my
reservation
or
in
depriving
me
of
my
property
they
finally
agreed
that
i
should
sign
a
petition
to
congress
praying
for
my
naturalization
and
for
the
confirmation
of
the
title
of
my
land
to
me
my
heirs
brooks
came
with
the
petition
i
signed
it
and
it
was
witnessed
by
thomas
clute
and
two
others
and
then
returned
to
brooks
who
presented
it
to
the
legislature
of
this
state
at
its
session
in
the
winter
of
on
the
of
april
an
act
was
passed
for
my
naturalization
and
ratifying
and
confirming
the
title
of
my
land
agreeable
to
the
tenor
of
the
petition
which
act
brooks
presented
to
me
on
the
first
day
of
may
following
thomas
clute
having
examined
the
law
told
me
that
it
would
probably
answer
though
it
was
not
according
to
the
agreement
made
by
brooks
and
esq
clute
and
himself
for
me
i
then
executed
to
micah
brooks
and
jellis
clute
a
deed
of
all
my
land
lying
east
of
the
picket
line
on
the
gardow
reservation
containing
about
acres
it
is
proper
in
this
place
to
observe
in
relation
to
thomas
clute
that
my
son
john
a
few
months
before
his
death
advised
me
to
take
him
for
my
guardian
as
i
had
become
old
and
incapable
of
managing
my
property
and
to
compensate
him
for
his
trouble
by
giving
him
a
lot
of
land
on
the
west
side
of
my
reservation
where
he
should
choose
it
i
accordingly
took
my
son
advice
and
clute
has
ever
since
been
faithful
and
honest
in
all
his
advice
and
dealings
with
and
for
myself
and
family
in
the
month
of
august
brooks
and
esq
clute
again
came
to
me
with
a
request
that
i
would
give
them
a
lease
of
the
land
which
i
had
already
deeded
to
them
together
with
the
other
part
of
my
reservation
excepting
and
reserving
to
myself
only
about
acres
at
this
time
i
informed
thomas
clute
of
what
john
had
advised
and
recommended
me
to
do
and
that
i
had
consulted
my
daughters
on
the
subject
who
had
approved
of
the
measure
he
readily
agreed
to
assist
me
whereupon
i
told
him
he
was
entitled
to
a
lot
of
land
and
might
select
as
john
had
mentioned
he
accordingly
at
that
time
took
such
a
piece
as
he
chose
and
the
same
has
ever
since
been
reserved
for
him
in
all
the
land
contracts
which
i
have
made
on
the
of
august
i
leased
to
micah
brooks
and
jellis
clute
the
whole
of
my
original
reservation
except
acres
and
thomas
clute
lot
finding
their
title
still
incomplete
on
account
of
the
united
states
government
and
seneca
chiefs
not
having
sanctioned
my
acts
they
solicited
me
to
renew
the
contract
and
have
the
conveyance
made
to
them
in
such
a
manner
as
that
they
should
thereby
be
constituted
sole
proprietors
of
the
soil
in
the
winter
of
i
agreed
with
them
that
if
they
would
get
the
chiefs
of
our
nation
and
a
united
states
commissioner
of
indian
lands
to
meet
in
council
at
moscow
livingston

there
concur
in
my
agreement
that
i
would
sell
to
them
all
my
right
and
title
to
the
gardow

with
the
exception
of
a
tract
for
my
own
benefit

one

should

it
seems
a
miracle
that
i
am
unable
to
account
for
and
is
a
tragical
medley
that
i
hope
will
never
be
repeated
the
bare
loss
of
liberty
is
but
a
mere
trifle
when
compared
with
the
circumstances
that
necessarily
attend
and
are
inseparably
connected
with
it
it
is
the
recollection
of
what
we
once
were
of
the
friends
the
home
and
the
pleasures
that
we
have
left
or
lost
the
anticipation
of
misery
the
appearance
of
wretchedness
the
anxiety
for
freedom
the
hope
of
release
the
devising
of
means
of
escaping
and
the
vigilance
with
which
we
watch
our
keepers
that
constitute
the
nauseous
dregs
of
the
bitter
cup
of
slavery
i
am
sensible
however
that
no
one
can
pass
from
a
state
of
freedom
to
that
of
slavery
and
in
the
last
situation
rest
perfectly
contented
but
as
every
one
knows
that
great
exertions
of
the
mind
tend
directly
to
debilitate
the
body
it
will
appear
obvious
that
we
ought
when
confined
to
exert
all
our
faculties
to
promote
our
present
comfort
and
let
future
days
provide
their
own
sacrifices
in
regard
to
ourselves
just
as
we
feel
we
are
for
the
preservation
of
my
life
to
the
present
time
i
am
indebted
to
an
excellent
constitution
with
which
i
have
been
blessed
in
as
great
a
degree
as
any
other
person
after
i
arrived
to
years
of
understanding
the
care
of
my
own
health
was
one
of
my
principal
studies
and
by
avoiding
exposures
to
wet
and
cold
by
temperance
in
eating
abstaining
from
the
use
of
spirits
and
shunning
the
excesses
to
which
i
was
frequently
exposed
i
effected
my
object
beyond
what
i
expected
i
have
never
once
been
sick
till
within
a
year
or
two
only
as
i
have
related
spirits
and
tobacco
i
have
never
used
and
i
have
never
once
attended
an
indian
frolic
when
i
was
taken
prisoner
and
for
sometime
after
that
spirits
was
not
known
and
when
it
was
first
introduced
it
was
in
small
quantities
and
used
only
by
the
indians
so
that
it
was
a
long
time
before
the
indian
women
begun
to
even
taste
it
after
the
french
war
for
a
number
of
years
it
was
the
practice
of
the
indians
of
our
tribe
to
send
to
niagara
and
get
two
or
three
kegs
of
rum
in
all
six
or
eight
gallons
and
hold
a
frolic
as
long
as
it
lasted
when
the
rum
was
brought
to
the
town
all
the
indians
collected
and
before
a
drop
was
drank
gave
all
their
knives
tomahawks
guns
and
other
instruments
of
war
to
one
indian
whose
business
it
was
to
bury
them
in
a
private
place
keep
them
concealed
and
remain
perfectly
sober
till
the
frolic
was
ended
having
thus
divested
themselves
they
commenced
drinking
and
continued
their
frolic
till
every
drop
was
consumed
if
any
of
them
became
quarrelsome
or
got
to
fighting
those
who
were
sober
enough
bound
them
upon
the
ground
where
they
were
obliged
to
lie
till
they
got
sober
and
then
were
unbound
when
the
fumes
of
the
spirits
had
left
the
company
the
sober
indian
returned
to
each
the
instruments
with
which
they
had
entrusted
him
and
all
went
home
satisfied
a
frolic
of
that
kind
was
held
but
once
a
year
and
that
at
the
time
the
indians
quit
their
hunting
and
come
in
with
their
in
those
frolics
the
women
never
participated
soon
after
the
revolutionary
war
however
spirits
became
common
in
our
tribe
and
has
been
used
indiscriminately
by
both
sexes
though
there
are
not
so
frequent
instances
of
intoxication
amongst
the
squaws
as
amongst
the
indians
to
the
introduction
and
use
or
that
baneful
article
which
has
made
such
devastation
in
our
tribes
and
threatens
the
extinction
of
our
people
the
indians
i
can
with
the
greatest
propriety
impute
the
whole
of
my
misfortune
in
losing
my
three
sons
but
as
i
have
before
observed
not
even
the
love
of
life
will
restrain
an
indian
from
sipping
the
poison
that
he
knows
will
destroy
him
the
voice
of
nature
the
rebukes
of
reason
the
advice
of
parents
the
expostulations
of
friends
and
the
numerous
instances
of
sudden
death
are
all
insufficient
to
reclaim
an
indian
who
has
once
experienced
the
exhilarating
and
inebriating
effects
of
spirits
from
seeking
his
grave
in
the
bottom
of
his
bottle
my
strength
has
been
great
for
a
woman
of
my
size
otherwise
i
must
long
ago
have
died
under
the
burdens
which
i
was
obliged
to
carry
i
learned
to
carry
loads
on
my
back
in
a
strap
placed
across
my
forehead
soon
after
my
captivity
and
continue
to
carry
in
the
same
way
upwards
of
thirty
years
ago
with
the
help
of
my
young
children
i
backed
all
the
boards
that
were
used
about
my
house
from
allen
mill
at
the
outlet
of
silver
lake
a
distance
of
five
miles
i
have
planted
hoed
and
harvested
corn
every
season
but
one
since
i
was
taken
prisoner
even
this
present
fall
i
have
husked
my
corn
and
backed
it
into
the
house
the
first
cow
that
i
ever
owned
i
bought
of
a
squaw
sometime
after
the
revolution
it
had
been
stolen
from
the
enemy
i
had
owned
it
but
a
few
days
when
it
fell
into
a
hole
and
almost
died
before
we
could
get
it
out
after
this
the
squaw
wanted
to
be
recanted
but
as
i
would
not
give
up
the
cow
i
gave
her
money
enough
to
make
when
added
to
the
sum
which
i
paid
her
at
first
dollars
cows
were
plenty
on
the
ohio
when
i
lived
there
and
of
good
quality
for
provisions
i
have
never
suffered
since
i
came
upon
the
flats
nor
have
i
ever
been
in
debt
to
any
other
hands
than
my
own
for
the
plenty
that
i
have
shared
my
vices
that
have
been
suspected
have
been
but
few
it
was
believed
for
a
long
time
by
some
of
our
people
that
i
was
a
great
witch
but
they
were
unable
to
prove
my
guilt
and
consequently
i
escaped
the
certain
doom
of
those
who
are
convicted
of
that
crime
which
by
indians
is
considered
as
heinous
as
murder
some
of
my
children
had
light
brown
hair
and
tolerable
fair
skin
which
used
to
make
some
say
that
i
stole
them
yet
as
i
was
ever
conscious
of
my
own
constancy
i
never
thought
that
any
one
really
believed
that
i
was
guilty
of
adultery
i
have
been
the
mother
of
eight
children
three
of
whom
are
now
living
and
i
have
at
this
time
grand
children
and
fourteen
children
all
living
in
the
neighborhood
of
genesee
river
and
at
buffalo
i
live
in
my
own
house
and
on
my
own
land
with
my
youngest

polly
who
is
married
to
george
chongo

has
three
children
my
daughter
nancy
who
is

about

south

my
other
daughter
betsey
is
married
to
john
green
has
seven
children
and
resides
rods
north
of
my
house
thus
situated
in
the
midst
of
my
children
i
expect
i
shall
soon
leave
the
world
and
make
room
for
the
rising
generation
i
feel
the
weight
of
years
with
which
i
am
loaded
and
am
sensible
of
my
daily
failure
in
seeing
hearing
and
strength
but
my
only
anxiety
is
for
my
family
if
my
family
will
live
happily
and
i
can
be
exempted
from
trouble
while
i
have
to
stay
i
feel
as
though
i
could
lay
down
in
peace
a
life
that
has
been
checked
in
almost
every
hour
with
troubles
of
a
deeper
dye
than
are
commonly
experienced
by

appendix
an
account
of
the
destruction
of
a
part
of
the
british
army
by
the
indians
at
a
place
called
the
devil
hole
on
the
niagara
river
in
the
year
it
is
to
be
regretted
that
an
event
of
so
tragical
a
nature
as
the
following
should
have
escaped
the
pens
of
american
historians
and
have
been
suffered
to
slide
down
the
current
of
time
to
the
verge
of
oblivion
without
having
been
snatched
almost
from
the
vortex
of
forgetfulness
and
placed
on
the
faithful
page
as
a
memorial
of
premeditated
cruelties
which
in
former
times
were
practised
upon
the
white
people
by
the
north
american
savages
modern
history
perhaps
can
not
furnish
a
parallel
so
atrocious
in
design
and
execution
as
the
one
before
us
and
it
may
be
questioned
even
if
the
history
of
ancient
times
when
men
fought
hand
to
hand
and
disgraced
their
nature
by
inventing
engines
of
torture
can
more
than
produce
its
equal
it
will
be
observed
in
the
preceding
narrative
that
the
affair
at
the
devil
hole
is
said
to
have
happened
in
november
that
jemison
arrived
at
genesee
about
that
time
is
rendered
certain
from
a
number
of
circumstances
and
that
a
battle
was
fought
on
the
niagara
in
in
which
two
prisoners
and
some
oxen
were
taken
and
brought
to
genesee
as
she
has
stated
is
altogether
probable
but
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
event
which
is
the
subject
of
this
article
did
not
take
place
till
the
year
in
the
time
of
the
french
war
the
neighborhood
of
forts
niagara
and
sclusser
or
schlosser
as
it
was
formerly
written
on
the
niagara
river
was
a
general
and
for
this
reason
memory
ought
not
to
be
charged
with
treachery
for
not
having
been
able
to
distinguish
accurately
after
the
lapse
of
sixty
years
between
the
circumstances
of
one
engagement
and
those
of
another
she
resided
on
the
genesee
at
the
time
when
the
warriors
of
that
tribe
marched
off
to
assist
in
laying
the
ambush
at
the
devil
hole
and
no
one
will
doubt
her
having
heard
them
rehearse
the
story
of
the
event
of
that
nefarious
campaign
after
they
returned
chronology
and
history
concur
in
stating
that
fort
niagara
was
taken
from
the
french
by
the
british
and
that
prideaux
was
killed
on
the
of
july
having
obtained
from
jemison
a
kind
of
introduction
to
the
story
i
concluded
that
if
it
yet
remained
possible
to
procure
a
correct
account
of
the
circumstances
which
led
to
and
attended
that
transaction
it
would
be
highly
gratifying
to
the
american
public
i
accordingly
directed
a
letter
to
linus
everett
of
buffalo
whose
ministerial
labor
i
well
knew
frequently
called
him
to
lewiston
requesting
him
to
furnish
me
with
a
particular
account
of
the
destruction
of
the
british
at
the
time
and
place
before
mentioned
he
obligingly
complied
with
my
request
and
gave
me
the
result
of
his
inquiries
on
that
subject
in
the
following
letter
copy
of
a
letter
from
linus
everett
dated
fort
sclusser
december
and
dear
i
hasten
with
much
pleasure
to
comply
with
your
request
in
regard
to
the
affair
at
the
devil
hole
i
have
often
wondered
that
no
authentic
account
has
ever
been
given
of
that
bloody
and
tragical
scene
i
have
made
all
the
inquiries
that
appear
to
be
of
any
use
and
proceed
to
give
you
the
result
at
this
place
fort
sclusser
an
old
gentleman
now
resides
to
whom
i
am
indebted
for
the
best
account
of
the
affair
that
can
be
easily
obtained
his
name
is
jesse
ware
his
age
about
although
he
was
not
a
resident
of
this
part
of
the
country
at
the
time
of
the
event
yet
from
his
intimate
acquaintance
with
one
of
the
survivors
he
is
able
to
give
much
information
which
otherwise
could
not
be
obtained
the
account
that
he
gives
is
as
follows
in
july
the
british
under
sir
william
johnston
took
possession
of
forts
niagara
and
sclusser
which
had
before
been
in
the
hands
of
the
french
at
this
time
the
seneca
indians
which
were
a
numerous
and
powerful
nation
were
hostile
to
the
british
and
warmly
allied
to
the
french
these
two
posts
viz
niagara
and
sclusser
were
of
great
importance
to
the
british
on
the
account
of
affording
the
means
of
communication
with
the
posts
above
or
on
the
upper
lakes
in
a
contract
was
made
between
sir
william
johnston
and
a
stedman
to
construct
a
portage
road
from
queenston
landing
to
fort
sclusser
a
distance
of
eight
miles
in
order
to
facilitate
the
transportation
of
provision
ammunition
from
one
place
to
the
other
in
conformity
to
this
agreement
on
the
of
june
stedman
had
completed
his
road
and
appeared
at
queenston
landing
now
lewiston
with
portage
wagons
and
one
hundred
horses
and
oxen
to
transport
to
fort
sclusser
the
stores
at
this
time
sir
william
johnston
was
suspicious
of
the
intentions
of
the
senecas
for
after
the
surrender
of
the
forts
by
the
french
they
had
appeared
uneasy
and
hostile
in
order
to
prevent
the
teams
drivers
and
goods
receiving
injury
he
detached
troops
to
guard
them
across
the
portage
the
teams
under
this
escort
started
from
queenston
landing
stedman
who
had
the
charge
of
the
whole
was
on
horse
back
and
rode
between
the
troops
and
teams
all
the
troops
being
in
front
on
a
small
hill
near
the
devil
hole
at
that
time
was
a
redoubt
of
twelve
men
which
served
as
a
kind
of
guard
on
ordinary
occasions
against
the
depredations
of
the
savages
on
the
arrival
of
the
troops
and
teams
at
the
devil
hole
says
a
manuscript
in
the
hands
of
my
informant
the
sachems
chiefs
and
warriors
of
the
seneca
indians
sallied
from
the
adjoining
woods
by
thousands
where
they
had
been
concealed
for
some
time
before
for
that
nefarious
purpose
and
falling
upon
the
troops
teams
and
drivers
and
the
guard
of
twelve
men
before
mentioned
they
killed
all
the
men
but
three
on
the
spot
or
by
driving
them
together
with
the
teams
down
the
precipice
which
was
about
seventy
or
eighty
feet
the
indians
seized
stedman
horse
by
the
bridle
while
he
was
on
him
designing
no
doubt
to
make
his
sufferings
more
lasting
than
that
of
his
companions
but
while
the
bloody
scene
was
acting
the
attention
of
the
indian
who
held
the
horse
of
stedman
being
arrested
he
cut
the
reins
of
his
bridle
clapped
spurs
to
his
horse
and
rode
over
the
dead
and
dying
into
the
adjacent
woods
without
receiving
injury
from
the
enemy
firing
thus
he
escaped
and
besides
him
two
others
one
a
drummer
who
fell
among
the
trees
was
caught
by
his
drum
strap
and
escaped
unhurt
the
other
one
who
fell
down
the
precipice
and
broke
his
thigh
but
crawled
to
the
landing
or
garrison
down
the
river
the
following
september
the
indians
gave
stedman
a
piece
of
land
as
a
reward
for
his
bravery
with
sentiments
of
respect

the
indians

corps

marched
to
schoharie
in
this
state
of
and
there
went
into
winter
quarters
the
company
to
which
i
was
attached
was
commanded
by
capt
michael
simpson
and
thomas
boyd
of
northumberland
county
pennsylvania
was
our
lieutenant
in
the
following
spring
our
corps
together
with
the
whole
body
of
troops
under
the
command
of
clinton
to
the
amount
of
about
embarked
in
boats
at
schenectady
and
ascended
the
mohawk
as
far
as
german
flats
thence
we
took
a
direction
to
otsego
lake
descended
the
susquehanna
and
without
any
remarkable
occurrence
arrived
at
tioga
point
where
our
troops
united
with
an
army
of
men
under
the
command
of
sullivan
who
had
marched
through
a
part
of
and
had
reached
that
place
by
the
way
of
wyoming
some
days
before
us
that
part
of
the
army
under
sullivan
had
on
their
arrival
at
tioga
point
found
the
indians
in
some
force
there
with
whom
they
had
had
some
unimportant
skirmishes
before
our
arrival
upon
the
junction
of
these
two
bodies
of
troops
sullivan
assumed
the
command
of
the
whole
and
proceeded
up
the
tioga
when
within
a
few
miles
of
the
place
now
called
newtown
we
were
met
by
a
body
of
indians
and
a
number
of
troops
well
known
in
those
times
by
the
name
of
butler
rangers
who
had
thrown
up
hastily
a
breastwork
of
logs
trees
they
were
however
easily
driven
from
their
works
with
considerable
loss
on
their
part
and
without
any
injury
to
our
troops
the
enemy
fled
with
so
much
precipitation
that
they
left
behind
them
some
stores
and
camp
equippage
they
retreated
but
a
short
distance
before
they
made
a
stand
and
built
another
breastwork
of
considerable
length
in
the
woods
near
a
small
opening
sullivan
was
soon
apprized
of
their
situation
divided
his
army
and
attempted
to
surround
by
sending
one
half
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
left
with
directions
to
meet
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
enemies
in
order
to
prevent
their
retreating
he
directed
to
be
thrown
over
them
which
was
done
but
on
the
shells
bursting
the
indians
suspected
that
a
powerful
army
had
opened
a
heavy
fire
upon
them
on
that
side
and
fled
with
the
utmost
precipitation
through
one
wing
of
the
surrounding
army
a
great
number
of
the
enemy
were
killed
and
our
army
suffered
considerably
the
indians
having
in
this
manner
escaped
they
went
up
the
river
to
a
place
called
the
narrows
where
they
were
attacked
by
our
men
who
killed
them
in
great
numbers
so
that
the
sides
of
the
rocks
next
the
river
appeared
as
though
blood
had
been
poured
on
them
by
pailfulls
the
indians
threw
their
dead
into
the
river
and
escaped
the
best
way
they
could
from
newtown
our
army
went
directly
to
the
head
of
the
seneca
lake
thence
down
that
lake
to
its
mouth
where
we
found
the
indian
village
at
that
place
evacuated
except
by
a
single
inhabitant
a
male
child
about
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
who
was
found
asleep
in
one
of
the
indian
huts
its
fate
i
have
never
ascertained
it
was
taken
into
the
care
of
an
officer
of
the
army
who
on
account
of
ill
health
was
not
on
duty
and
who
took
the
child
with
him
as
i
have
since
understood
to
his
residence
on
or
near
the
north
river
from
the
mouth
of
seneca
lake
we
proceeded
without
the
occurrence
of
any
thing
of
importance
by
the
outlets
of
the
canandaigua
honeoye
and
hemlock
lakes
to
the
head
of
connissius
lake
where
the
army
encamped
on
the
ground
that
is
now
called
henderson
flats
soon
after
the
army
had
encamped
at
the
dusk
of
the
evening
a
party
of
men
under
the
command
of
lieut
boyd
was
detached
from
the
rifle
corps
and
sent
out
for
the
purpose
of
reconnoitering
the
ground
near
the
genesee
river
at
a
place
now
called
williamsburg
at
a
distance
from
the
camp
of
about
seven
miles
under
the
guidance
of
a
faithful
indian
pilot
that
place
was
then
the
site
of
an
indian
village
and
it
was
apprehended
that
the
indians
and
rangers
might
be
there
or
in
that
vicinity
in
considerable
force
on
the
arrival
of
the
party
at
williamsburg
they
found
that
the
indian
village
had
been
recently
deserted
as
the
fires
in
the
huts
were
still
burning
the
night
was
so
far
spent
when
they
got
to
their
place
of
destination
that
lieutenant
boyd
considering
the
fatigue
of
his
men
concluded
to
remain
during
the
night
near
the
village
and
to
send
two
men
messengers
with
a
report
to
the
camp
in
the
morning
accordingly
a
little
before
daybreak
he
despatched
two
men
to
the
main
body
of
the
army
with
information
that
the
enemy
had
not
been
discovered
after
lieut
boyd
cautiously
crept
from
the
place
of
his
concealment
and
upon
getting
a
view
of
the
village
discovered
two
indians
hovering
about
the
settlement
one
of
whom
was
immediately
shot
and
scalped
by
one
of
the
riflemen
whose
name
was
murphy
supposing
that
if
there
were
indians
in
that
vicinity
or
near
the
village
they
would
be
instantly
alarmed
by
this
occurrence
lieut
boyd
thought
it
most
prudent
to
retire
and
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
general
encampment
of
our
army
they
accordingly
set
out
and
retraced
the
steps
which
they
had
taken
the
day
before
till
they
were
intercepted
by
the
enemy
on
their
arriving
within
about
one
mile
and
a
half
of
the
main
army
they
were
surprized
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
body
of
indians
to
the
amount
of
five
hundred
under
the
command
of
the
celebrated
brandt
and
the
same
number
of
rangers
commanded
by
the
infamous
butler
who
had
secreted
themselves
in
a
ravine
of
considerable
extent
which
lay
across
the
track
that
lieut
boyd
had
pursued
upon
discovering
the
enemy
and
knowing
that
the
only
chance
for
escape
was
by
breaking
through
their
line
one
of
the
most
desperate
enterprizes
ever
undertaken
lieut
boyd
after
a
few
words
of
encouragement
led
his
men
to
the
attempt
as
extraordinary
as
it
may
seem
the
first
onset
though
unsuccessful
was
made
without
the
loss
of
a
man
on
the
part
of
the
heroic
band
though
several
of
the
enemy
were
killed
two
attempts
more
were
made
which
were
equally
unsuccessful
and
in
which
the
whole
party
fell
except
lieut
boyd
and
eight
others
lieut
boyd
and
a
soldier
by
the
name
of
parker
were
taken
prisoners
on
the
spot
a
part
of
the
remainder
fled
and
a
part
fell
on
the
ground
apparently
dead
and
were
overlooked
by
the
indians
who
were
too
much
engaged
in
pursuing
the
fugitives
to
notice
those
who
fell
when
lieut
boyd
found
himself
a
prisoner
he
solicited
an
interview
with
brandt
whom
he
well
knew
commanded
the
indians
this
chief
who
was
at
that
moment
near
immediately
presented
himself
when
lieut
boyd
by
one
of
those
appeals
which
are
known
only
by
those
who
have
been
initiated
and
instructed
in
certain
mysteries
and
which
never
fail
to
bring
succor
to
a
distressed
brother
addressed
him
as
the
only
source
from
which
he
could
expect
a
respite
from
cruel
punishment
or
death
the
appeal
was
recognized
and
brandt
immediately
and
in
the
strongest
language
assured
him
that
his
life
should
be
spared
lieut
boyd
and
his
parker
were
immediately
conducted
by
a
party
of
the
indians
to
the
indian
village
called
beard
town
on
the
west
side
of
genesee
river
in
what
is
now
called
leicester
after
their
arrival
at
beard
town
brandt
their
generous
preserver
being
called
on
service
which
required
a
few
hours
absence
left
them
in
the
care
of
the
british
butler
of
the
rangers
who
as
soon
as
brandt
had
left
them
commenced
an
interrogation
to
obtain
from
the
prisoners
a
statement
of
the
number
situation
and
intentions
of
the
army
under
sullivan
and
threatened
them
in
case
they
hesitated
or
prevaricated
in
their
answers
to
deliver
them
up
immediately
to
be
massacred
by
the
indians
who
in
brandt
absence
and
with
the
encouragement
of
their
more
savage
commander
butler
were
ready
to
commit
the
greatest
cruelties
relying
probably
on
the
promises
which
brandt
had
made
them
and
which
he
undoubtedly
meant
to
fulfil
they
refused
to
give
butler
the
desired
information
butler
upon
this
hastened
to
put
his
threat
into
execution
they
were
delivered
to
some
of
their
most
ferocious
enemies
who
after
having
put
them
to
very
severe
torture
killed
them
by
severing
their
heads
from
their
bodies
the
main
army
immediately
after
hearing
of
the
situation
of
lieut
boyd
detachment
moved
on
towards
genesee
river
and
finding
the
bodies
of
those
who
were
slain
in
boyd
heroic
attempt
to
penetrate
through
the
enemy
line
buried
them
in
what
is
now
the
town
of
groveland
where
the
grave
is
to
be
seen
at
this
day
upon
their
arrival
at
the
genesee
river
they
crossed
over
scoured
the
country
for
some
distance
on
the
river
burnt
the
indian
villages
on
the
genesee
flats
and
destroyed
all
their
corn
and
other
means
of
subsistence
the
bodies
of
lieut
boyd
and
parker
were
found
and
buried
near
the
bank
of
beard
creek
under
a
bunch
of
wild
on
the
road
as
it
now
runs
from
moscow
to
geneseo
i
was
one
of
those
who
committed
to
the
earth
the
remains
of
my
friend
and
companion
in
arms
the
gallant
boyd
immediately
after
these
events
the
army
commenced
its
march
back
by
the
same
route
that
it
came
to
tioga
point
thence
down
the
susquehanna
to
wyoming
and
thence
across
the
country
to
morristown
where
we
went
into
winter
quarters
sullivan
bravery
is
unimpeachable
he
was
unacquainted
however
with
fighting
the
indians
and
made
use
of
the
best
means
to
keep
them
at
such
a
distance
that
they
could
not
be
brought
into
an
engagement
it
was
his
practice
morning
and
evening
to
have
cannon
fired
in
or
near
the
camp
by
which
the
indians
were
notified
of
their
speed
in
marching
and
of
his
situation
and
were
enabled
to
make
a
seasonable
retreat
the
foregoing
account
according
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
is
strictly
correct

their
preservation
from
utter
the
means

which
the
people
who
preceded

were
destroyed
and
the
cause
of
the
different
indian
languages
the
tradition
of
the
seneca
indians
in
regard
to
their
origin
as
we
are
assured
by
capt
horatio
jones
who
was
a
prisoner
five
years
amongst
them
and
for
many
years
since
has
been
an
interpreter
and
agent
for
the
payment
of
their
annuities
is
that
they
broke
out
of
the
earth
from
a
large
mountain
at
the
head
of
canandaigua
lake
and
that
mountain
they
still
venerate
as
the
place
of
their
birth
thence
they
derive
their
name
footnote
this
by
some
is
spoken
or
great

and
are
called

people
which
is
the
true
definition
of
the
word
seneca
the
great
hill
at
the
head
of
canandaigua
lake
from
whence
they
sprung
is
called
genundewah
and
has
for
a
long
time
past
been
the
place
where
the
indians
of
that
nation
have
met
in
council
to
hold
great
talks
and
to
offer
up
prayers
to
the
great
spirit
on
account
of
its
having
been
their
birth
place
and
also
in
consequence
of
the
destruction
of
a
serpent
at
that
place
in
ancient
time
in
a
most
miraculous
manner
which
threatened
the
destruction
of
the
whole
of
the
senecas
and
barely
spared
enough
to
commence
replenishing
the
earth
the
indians
say
says
capt
jones
that
the
fort
on
the
big
hill
or
genundewah
near
the
head
of
canandaigua
lake
was
surrounded
by
a
monstrous
serpent
whose
head
and
tail
came
together
at
the
gate
a
long
time
it
lay
there
confounding
the
people
with
its
breath
at
length
they
attempted
to
make
their
escape
some
with
their
and
others
with
different
implements
of
household
furniture
and
in
marching
out
of
the
fort
walked
down
the
throat
of
the
serpent
two
orphan
children
who
had
escaped
this
general
destruction
by
being
left
some
time
before
on
the
outside
of
the
fort
were
informed
by
an
oracle
of
the
means
by
which
they
could
get
rid
of
their
formidable
enemy
which
was
to
take
a
small
bow
and
a
poisoned
arrow
made
of
a
kind
of
willow
and
with
that
shoot
the
serpent
under
its
scales
this
they
did
and
the
arrow
proved
effectual
for
on
its
penetrating
the
skin
the
serpent
became
sick
and
extending
itself
rolled
down
the
hill
destroying
all
the
timber
that
was
in
its
way
disgorging
itself
and
breaking
wind
greatly
as
it
went
at
every
motion
a
human
head
was
discharged
and
rolled
down
the
hill
into
the
lake
where
they
lie
at
this
day
in
a
petrified
state
having
the
hardness
and
appearance
of
stones
to
this
day
the
indians
visit
that
sacred
place
to
mourn
the
loss
of
their
friends
and
to
celebrate
some
rites
that
are
peculiar
to
themselves
to
the
knowledge
of
white
people
there
has
been
no
timber
on
the
great
hill
since
it
was
first
discovered
by
them
though
it
lay
apparently
in
a
state
of
nature
for
a
great
number
of
years
without
cultivation
stones
in
the
shape
of
indians
heads
may
be
seen
lying
in
the
lake
in
great
plenty
which
are
said
to
be
the
same
that
were
deposited
there
at
the
death
of
the
serpent
the
senecas
have
a
tradition
that
previous
to
and
for
some
time
after
their
origin
at
genundewah
this
country
especially
about
the
lakes
was
thickly
inhabited
by
a
race
of
civil
enterprizing
and
industrious
people
who
were
totally
destroyed
by
the
great
serpent
that
afterwards
surrounded
the
great
hill
fort
with
the
assistance
of
others
of
the
same
species
and
that
they
the
senecas
went
into
possession
of
the
improvements
that
were
left
in
those
days
the
indians
throughout
the
whole
country
as
the
senecas
say
spoke
one
language
but
having
become
considerably
numerous
the
before
mentioned
great
serpent
by
an
unknown
influence
confounded
their
language
so
that
they
could
not
understand
each
other
which
was
the
cause
of
their
division
into
nations
as
the
mohawks
oneidas
at
that
time
however
the
senecas
retained
their
original
language
and
continued
to
occupy
their
mother
hill
on
which
they
fortified
themselves
against
their
enemies
and
lived
peaceably
till
having
offended
the
serpent
footnote
the
pagans
of
the
senecas
believe
that
all
the
little
snakes
were
made
of
the
blood
of
the
great
serpent
after
it
rolled
into
the
lake
they
were
cut
off
as
before
stated
of
their
religion
feasts
and
great
sacrifice
perhaps
no
people
are
more
exact
observers
of
religious
duties
than
those
indians
among
the
senecas
who
are
denominated
pagans
in
contradistinction
from
those
who
having
renounced
some
of
their
former
superstitious
notions
have
obtained
the
name
of
christians
the
traditionary
faith
of
their
fathers
having
been
orally
transmitted
to
them
from
time
immemorial
is
implicitly
believed
scrupulously
adhered
to
and
rigidly
practised
they
are
agreed
in
their
sentiments
are
all
of
one
order
and
have
individual
and
public
good
especially
among
themselves
for
the
great
motive
which
excites
them
to
attend
to
those
moral
virtues
that
are
directed
and
explained
by
all
their
rules
and
in
all
their
ceremonies
many
years
have
elapsed
since
the
introduction
of
christian
missionaries
among
them
whom
they
have
heard
and
very
generally
understand
the
purport
of
the
message
they
were
sent
to
deliver
they
say
that
it
is
highly
probable
that
jesus
christ
came
into
the
world
in
old
times
to
establish
a
religion
that
would
promote
the
happiness
of
the
white
people

the
other

the
sea
and
that
he
died
for
the
sins
of
his
people
as
the
missionaries
have
informed
them
but
they
say
that
jesus
christ
had
nothing
to
do
with
them
and
that
the
christian
religion
was
not
designed
for
their
benefit
but
rather
should
they
embrace
it
they
are
confident
it
would
make
them
worse
and
consequently
do
them
an
injury
they
say
also
that
the
great
good
spirit
gave
them
their
religion
and
that
it
is
better
adapted
to
their
circumstances
situation
and
habits
and
to
the
promotion
of
their
present
comfort
and
ultimate
happiness
than
any
system
that
ever
has
or
can
be
devised
they
however
believe
that
the
christian
religion
is
better
calculated
for
the
good
of
white
people
than
theirs
is
and
wonder
that
those
who
have
embraced
it
do
not
attend
more
strictly
to
its
precepts
and
feel
more
engaged
for
its
support
and
diffusion
among
themselves
at
the
present
time
they
are
opposed
to
preachers
or
schoolmasters
being
sent
or
coming
among
them
and
appear
determined
by
all
means
to
adhere
to
their
ancient
customs
they
believe
in
a
great
good
spirit
whom
they
call
in
the
seneca
language
as
the
creator
of
the
world
and
of
every
good
thing
that
he
made
men
and
all
inoffensive
animals
that
he
supplies
men
with
all
the
comforts
of
life
and
that
he
is
particularly
partial
to
the
indians
whom
they
say
are
his
peculiar
people
they
also
believe
that
he
is
pleased
in
giving
them
the
indians
good
gifts
and
that
he
is
highly
gratified
with
their
good
conduct
that
he
abhors
their
vices
and
that
he
is
willing
to
punish
them
for
their
bad
conduct
not
only
in
this
world
but
in
a
future
state
of
existence
his
residence
they
suppose
lies
at
a
great
distance
from
them
in
a
country
that
is
perfectly
pleasant
where
plenty
abounds
even
to
profusion
that
there
the
soil
is
completely
fertile
and
the
seasons
so
mild
that
the
corn
never
fails
to
be
good
that
the
deer
elk
buffalo
turkies
and
other
useful
animals
are
numerous
and
that
the
forests
are
well
calculated
to
facilitate
their
hunting
them
with
success
that
the
streams
are
pure
and
abound
with
fish
and
that
nothing
is
wanting
to
render
fruition
complete
over
this
territory
they
say
nauwaneu
presides
as
an
king
and
that
without
counsel
he
admits
to
his
pleasures
all
whom
he
considers
to
be
worthy
of
enjoying
so
great
a
state
of
blessedness
to
this
being
they
address
prayers
offer
sacrifices
give
thanks
for
favors
and
perform
many
acts
of
devotion
and
reverence
they
likewise
believe
that
nauwaneu
has
a
brother
that
is
less
powerful
than
himself
and
who
is
opposed
to
him
and
to
every
one
that
is
or
wishes
to
be
good
that
this
bad
spirit
made
all
evil
things
snakes
wolves
catamounts
and
all
other
poisonous
or
noxious
animals
and
beasts
of
prey
except
the
bear
which
on
the
account
of
the
excellence
of
its
meat
for
food
and
skin
for
clothing
they
say
was
made
by
nauwaneu
besides
all
this
they
say
he
makes
and
sends
them
their
diseases
bad
weather
and
bad
crops
and
that
he
makes
and
supports
witches
he
owns
a
large
country
adjoining
that
of
his
brother
with
whom
he
is
continually
at
variance
his
fields
are
unproductive
thick
clouds
intercept
the
rays
of
the
sun
and
consequently
destructive
frosts
are
frequent
game
is
very
scarce
and
not
easily
taken
ravenous
beasts
are
numerous
reptiles
of
every
poisoned
tooth
lie
in
the
path
of
the
traveller
streams
are
muddy
and
hunger
nakedness
and
general
misery
are
severely
felt
by
those
who
unfortunately
become
his
tenants
he
takes
pleasure
in
afflicting
the
indians
here
and
after
their
death
receives
all
those
into
his
dreary
dominions
who
in
their
life
time
have
been
so
vile
as
to
be
rejected
by
nauwaneu
under
whose
eye
they
are
continued
in
an
uncomfortable
state
forever
to
this
source
of
evil
they
offer
some
oblations
to
abate
his
vengeance
and
render
him
propitious
they
however
believe
him
to
be
in
a
degree
under
subjection
to
his
brother
and
incapable
of
executing
his
plans
only
by
his
high
permission
public
religious
duties
are
attended
to
in
the
celebration
of
particular
festivals
and
sacrifices
which
are
observed
with
circumspection
and
attended
with
decorum
in
each
year
they
have
five
feasts
or
stated
times
for
assembling
in
their
tribes
and
giving
thanks
to
nauwaneu
for
the
blessings
which
they
have
received
from
his
kind
and
liberal
and
provident
hand
and
also
to
converse
upon
the
best
means
of
meriting
a
continuance
of
his
favors
the
first
of
these
feasts
is
immediately
after
they
have
finished
sugaring
at
which
time
they
give
thanks
for
the
favorable
weather
and
great
quantity
of
sap
they
have
had
and
for
the
sugar
that
they
have
been
allowed
to
make
for
the
benefit
of
their
families
at
this
as
at
all
the
succeeding
feasts
the
chiefs
arise
singly
and
address
the
audience
in
a
kind
of
exhortation
in
which
they
express
their
own
thankfulness
urge
the
necessity
and
propriety
of
general
gratitude
and
point
out
the
course
which
ought
to
be
pursued
by
each
individual
in
order
that
nauwaneu
may
continue
to
bless
them
and
that
the
evil
spirit
may
be
defeated
on
these
occasions
the
chiefs
describe
a
perfectly
straight
line
half
an
inch
wide
and
perhaps
ten
miles
long
which
they
direct
their
people
to
travel
upon
by
placing
one
foot
before
the
other
with
the
heel
of
one
foot
to
the
toe
of
the
other
and
so
on
till
they
arrive
at
the
end
the
meaning
of
which
is
that
they
must
not
turn
aside
to
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
into
the
paths
of
vice
but
keep
straight
ahead
in
the
way
of
well
doing
that
will
lead
them
to
the
paradise
of
nauwaneu
the
second
feast
is
after
planting
when
they
render
thanks
for
the
pleasantness
of
the
season
for
the
good
time
they
have
had
for
preparing
their
ground
and
planting
their
corn
and
are
instructed
by
their
chiefs
by
what
means
to
merit
a
good
harvest
when
the
green
corn
becomes
fit
for
use
they
hold
their
third
or
green
corn
feast
their
fourth
is
celebrated
after
corn
harvest
and
the
fifth
at
the
close
of
their
year
and
is
always
celebrated
at
the
time
of
the
old
moon
in
the
last
of
january
or
first
of
february
this
last
deserves
a
particular
description
the
indians
having
returned
from
hunting
and
having
brought
in
all
the
venison
and
skins
that
they
have
taken
a
committee
is
appointed
says
jemison
consisting
of
from
ten
to
twenty
active
men
to
superintend
the
festivities
of
the
great
sacrifice
and
thanksgiving
that
is
to
be
immediately
celebrated
this
being
done
preparations
are
made
at
the
or
place
of
meeting
for
the
reception
and
accommodation
of
the
whole
tribe
and
then
the
ceremonies
are
commenced
and
the
whole
is
conducted
with
a
great
degree
of
order
and
harmony
under
the
direction
of
the
committee
two
white
dogs
footnote
this
was
the
practice
in
former
times
but
at
present
i
am
informed
that
only
one
dog
is
sacrificed
without
spot
or
blemish
are
selected
if
such
can
be
found
and
if
not
two
that
have
the
fewest
spots
from
those
belonging
to
the
tribe
and
killed
near
the
door
of
the
by
being
strangled
a
wound
on
the
animal
or
an
effusion
of
blood
would
spoil
the
victim
and
render
the
sacrifice
useless
the
dogs
are
then
painted
red
on
their
faces
edges
of
their
ears
and
on
various
parts
of
their
bodies
and
are
curiously
decorated
with
ribbons
of
different
colors
and
fine
feathers
which
are
tied
and
fastened
on
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
the
most
elegant
appearance
they
are
then
hung
on
a
post
near
the
door
of
the
at
the
height
of
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
this
being
done
the
frolic
is
commenced
by
those
who
are
present
while
the
committee
run
through
the
tribe
or
town
and
hurry
the
people
to
assemble
by
knocking
on
their
houses
at
this
time
the
committee
are
naked
wearing
only
a
and
each
carries
a
paddle
with
which
he
takes
up
ashes
and
scatters
them
about
the
house
in
every
direction
in
the
course
of
the
ceremonies
all
the
fire
is
extinguished
in
every
hut
throughout
the
tribe
and
new
fire
struck
from
the
flint
on
each
hearth
is
kindled
after
having
removed
the
whole
of
the
ashes
old
coals
having
done
this
and
discharged
one
or
two
guns
they
go
on
and
in
this
manner
they
proceed
till
they
have
visited
every
house
in
the
tribe
this
finishes
the
business
of
the
first
day
on
the
second
day
the
committee
dance
go
through
the
town
with
on
their
legs
and
at
every
time
they
start
they
fire
a
gun
they
also
beg
through
the
tribe
each
carrying
a
basket
in
which
to
receive
whatever
may
be
bestowed
the
alms
consist
of
indian
tobacco
and
other
articles
that
are
used
for
incense
at
the
sacrifice
each
manager
at
this
time
carries
a
dried
tortoise
or
turtle
shell
containing
a
few
beans
which
he
frequently
rubs
on
the
walls
of
the
houses
both
inside
and
out
this
kind
of
manoeuvering
by
the
committee
continues
two
or
three
days
during
which
time
the
people
at
the
recreate
themselves
by
dancing
on
the
fourth
or
fifth
day
the
committee
make
false
faces
of
husks
in
which
they
run
about
making
a
frightful
but
ludicrous
appearance
in
this
dress
still
wearing
the
they
run
to
the
smearing
themselves
with
dirt
and
bedaub
every
one
who
refuses
to
contribute
something
towards
filling
the
baskets
of
incense
which
they
continue
to
carry
soliciting
alms
during
all
this
time
they
collect
the
evil
spirit
or
drive
it
off
entirely
for
the
present
and
also
concentrate
within
themselves
all
the
sins
of
their
tribe
however
numerous
or
heinous
on
the
eighth
or
ninth
day
the
committee
having
received
all
the
sin
as
before
observed
into
their
own
bodies
they
take
down
the
dogs
and
after
having
transfused
the
whole
of
it
into
one
of
their
own
number
he
by
a
peculiar
slight
of
hand
or
kind
of
magic
works
it
all
out
of
himself
into
the
dogs
the
dogs
thus
loaded
with
all
the
sins
of
the
people
are
placed
upon
a
pile
of
wood
that
is
directly
set
on
fire
here
they
are
burnt
together
with
the
sins
with
which
they
were
loaded
surrounded
by
the
multitude
who
throw
incense
of
tobacco
or
the
like
into
the
fire
the
scent
of
which
they
say
goes
up
to
nauwaneu
to
whom
it
is
pleasant
and
acceptable
this
feast
continues
nine
days
footnote
at
present
as
i
have
been
informed
this
feast
is
not
commonly
held
more
than
from
five
to
seven
days
in
former
times
and
till
within
a
few
years
nine
days
were
particularly
observed
and
during
that
time
the
chiefs
review
the
national
affairs
of
the
year
past
agree
upon
the
best
plan
to
be
pursued
through
the
next
year
and
attend
to
all
internal
regulations
on
the
last
day
the
whole
company
partake
of
an
elegant
dinner
consisting
of
meat
corn
and
beans
boiled
together
in
large
kettles
and
stirred
till
the
whole
is
completely
mixed
and
soft
this
mess
is
devoured
without
much
ceremony
some
eat
with
a
spoon
by
dipping
out
of
the
kettles
others
serve
themselves
in
small
dippers
some
in
one
way
and
some
in
another
till
the
whole
is
consumed
after
this
they
perform
the
war
dance
the
peace
dance
and
smoke
the
pipe
of
peace
and
then
free
from
iniquity
each
repairs
to
his
place
of
abode
prepared
to
commence
the
business
of
a
new
year
in
this
feast
temperance
is
observed
and
commonly
order
prevails
in
a
greater
degree
than
would
naturally
be
expected
they
are
fond
of
the
company
of
spectators
who
are
disposed
to
be
decent
and
treat
them
politely
in
their
way
but
having
been
frequently
imposed
upon
by
the
whites
they
treat
them
generally
with
indifference
of
their
dances
of
these
two
only
will
be
noticed
the
war
dance
is
said
to
have
originated
about
the
time
that
the
six
nations
or
northern
indians
commenced
the
old
war
with
the
cherokees
and
other
southern
indian
nations
about
one
hundred
years
ago
when
a
tribe
or
number
of
tribes
of
the
six
nations
had
assembled
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
battle
with
their
enemies
the
chiefs
sung
this
song
and
accompanied
the
music
with
dancing
and
gestures
that
corresponded
with
the
sentiments
expressed
as
a
kind
of
stimulant
to
increase
their
courage
and
anxiety
to
march
forward
to
the
place
of
carnage
those
days
having
passed
away
the
indians
at
this
day
sing
the
song
to
commemorate
the
achievements
of
their
fathers
and
as
a
kind
of
amusement
when
they
perform
it
they
arm
themselves
with
a
tomahawk
and
knife
and
commence
singing
with
firm
voice
and
a
stern
resolute
countenance
but
before
they
get
through
they
exhibit
in
their
features
and
actions
the
most
shocking
appearance
of
anger
fury
and
vengeance
that
can
be
imagined
no
exhibition
of
the
kind
can
be
more
terrifying
to
a
stranger
the
song
requires
a
number
of
repetitions
in
the
tune
and
has
a
chorus
that
is
sung
at
the
end
of
each
verse
i
have
not
presumed
to
arrange
it
in
metre
but
the
following
is
the
substance
we
are
assembled
in
the
habiliments
of
war
and
will
go
in
quest
of
our
enemies
we
will
march
to
their
land
and
spoil
their
possessions
we
will
take
their
women
and
children
and
lead
them
into
captivity
the
warriors
shall
fall
by
our
we
will
give
them
no
quarter
our
tomahawks
we
will
dip
in
their
brains
with
our
scalping
knives
we
will
scalp
them
at
each
period
comes
on
the
chorus
which
consists
of
one
monosyllable
only
that
is
sounded
a
number
of
times
and
articulated
like
a
faint
stifled
groan
this
word
is
eh
and
signifies
we
will
or
we
will
go
or
we
will
do
while
singing
they
perform
the
ceremony
of
killing
and
scalping
with
a
great
degree
of
dexterity
the
peace
dance
is
performed
to
a
tune
without
words
by
both
sexes
the
indians
stand
erect
in
one
place
and
strike
the
floor
with
the
heel
and
toes
of
one
foot
and
then
of
the
other
the
heels
and
toes
all
the
while
nearly
level
without
changing
their
position
in
the
least
the
squaws
at
the
same
time
perform
it
by
keeping
the
feet
close
together
and
without
raising
them
from
the
ground
move
a
short
distance
to
the
right
and
then
to
the
left
by
first
moving
their
toes
and
then
their
heels
this
dance
is
beautiful
and
is
generally
attended
with
decency
of
their
government
their
government
is
an
oligarchy
of
a
mixed
nature
and
is
administered
by
chiefs
a
part
of
whose
offices
are
hereditary
and
a
part
elective
the
nation
is
divided
into
tribes
and
each
tribe
commonly
has
two
chiefs
one
of
these
inherits
his
office
from
his
father
he
superintends
all
civil
affairs
in
the
tribe
attends
the
national
council
of
which
he
is
a
member
assents
to
all
conveyances
of
land
and
is
consulted
on
every
subject
of
importance
the
other
is
elected
by
the
tribe
and
can
be
removed
at
the
pleasure
of
his
constituents
for
malconduct
he
also
is
a
member
of
the
national
council
but
his
principal
business
is
to
superintend
the
military
concerns
of
his
tribe
and
in
war
to
lead
his
warriors
to
battle
he
acts
in
concert
with
the
other
chief
and
their
word
is
implicitly
relied
on
as
the
law
by
which
they
must
be
governed
that
which
they
prohibit
is
not
meddled
with
the
indian
laws
are
few
and
easily
expounded
their
business
of
a
public
nature
is
transacted
in
council
where
every
decision
is
final
they
meet
in
general
council
once
a
year
and
sometimes
oftener
the
administration
of
their
government
is
not
attended

when
an

sees
a
squaw
whom
he
fancies
he
sends
a
present
to
her
mother
or
parents
who
on
receiving
it
consult
with
his

each
other
on
the
propriety
and

of

it

goes

what
has
been
mentioned
of

government
in
their

parents
are
very
mild
and
the
mother
superintends
the
children
the
word
of
the
indian
father
however
is
law
and
must
be
obeyed
by
the
whole
that
are
under
his
authority
one
thing
respecting
the
indian
women
is
worthy
of
attention
and
perhaps
of
imitation
although
it
is
now
a
days
considered
beneath
the
dignity
of
the
ladies
especially
those
who
are
the
most
refined
and
that
is
they
are
under
a
becoming
subjection
to
their
husbands
it
is
a
rule
inculcated
in
all
the
indian
tribes
and
practised
throughout
their
generations
that
a
squaw
shall
not
walk
before
her
indian
nor
pretend
to
take
the
lead
in
his
business
and
for
this
reason
we
never
can
see
a
party
on
the
march
to
or
from
hunting
and
the
like
in
which
the
squaws
are
not
directly
in
the
rear
of
their
partners
of
their
funerals
the
deceased
having
been
laid
out
in
his
best
clothing
is
put
into
a
coffin
of
boards
or
bark
and
with
him
is
deposited
in
every
instance
a
small
cup
and
a
cake
generally
two
or
three
candles
are
also
put
into
the
coffin
and
in
a
few
instances
at
the
burial
of
a
great
man
all
his
implements
of
war
are
buried
by
the
side
of
the
body
the
coffin
is
then
closed
and
carried
to
the
grave
on
its
being
let
down
the
person
who
takes
the
lead
of
the
solemn
transaction
or
a
chief
addresses
the
dead
in
a
short
speech
in
which
he
charges
him
not
to
be
troubled
about
himself
in
his
new
situation
nor
on
his
journey
and
not
to
trouble
his
friends
wife
or
children
whom
he
has
left
tells
him
that
if
he
meets
with
strangers
on
his
way
he
must
inform
them
what
tribe
he
belongs
to
who
his
relatives
are
the
situation
in
which
he
left
them
and
that
having
done
this
he
must
keep
on
till
he
arrives
at
the
good
fields
in
the
country
of
nauwaneu
that
when
he
arrives
there
he
will
see
all
his
ancestors
and
personal
friends
that
have
gone
before
him
who
together
with
all
the
chiefs
of
celebrity
will
receive
him
joyfully
and
furnish
him
with
every
article
of
perpetual
happiness
the
grave
is
now
filled
and
left
till
evening
when
some
of
the
nearest
relatives
of
the
dead
build
a
fire
at
the
head
of
it
near
which
they
set
till
morning
in
this
way
they
continue
to
practise
nine
successive
nights
when
believing
that
their
departed
friend
has
arrived
at
the
end
of
his
journey
they
discontinue
their
attention
during
this
time
the
relatives
of
the
dead
are
not
allowed
to
dance
formerly
frolics
were
held
after
the
expiration
of
nine
days
for
the
dead
at
which
all
the
squaws
got
drunk
and
those
were
the
only
occasions
on
which
they
were
intoxicated
but
lately
those
are
discontinued
and
squaws
feel
no
delicacy
in
getting
inebriated
of
their
credulity
as
ignorance
is
the
parent
of
credulity
it
is
not
a
thing
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
indians
should
possess
it
in
a
great
degree
and
even
suffer
themselves
to
be
dictated
and
governed
by
it
in
many
of
the
most
important
transactions
of
their
lives
they
place
great
confidence
in
dreams
attach
some
sign
to
every
uncommon
circumstance
and
believe
in
charms
spirits
and
many
supernatural
things
that
never
existed
only
in
minds
enslaved
to
ignorance
and
tradition
but
in
no
instance
is
their
credulity
so
conspicuous
as
in
their
unalterable
belief
in
witches
they
believe
there
are
many
of
these
and
that
next
to
the
author
of
evil
they
are
the
greatest
scourge
to
their
people
the
term
witch
by
them
is
used
both
in
the
masculine
and
feminine
gender
and
denotes
a
person
to
whom
the
evil
deity
has
delegated
power
to
inflict
diseases
cause
death
blast
corn
bring
bad
weather
and
in
short
to
cause
almost
any
calamity
to
which
they
are
liable
with
this
impression
and
believing
that
it
is
their
actual
duty
to
destroy
as
far
as
lies
in
their
power
every
source
of
unhappiness
it
has
been
a
custom
among
them
from
time
immemorial
to
destroy
every
one
that
they
could
convict
of
so
heinous
a
crime
and
in
fact
there
is
no
reprieve
from
the
sentence
jemison
informed
us
that
more
or
less
who
had
been
charged
with
being
witches
had
been
executed
in
almost
every
year
since
she
has
lived
on
the
genesee
many
on
being
suspected
made
their
escape
while
others
before
they
were
aware
of
being
implicated
have
been
apprehended
and
brought
to
trial
she
says
that
a
number
of
years
ago
an
indian
chased
a
squaw
near
beard
town
and
caught
her
but
on
the
account
of
her
great
strength
she
got
away
the
indian
vexed
and
disappointed
went
home
and
the
next
day
reported
that
he
saw
her
have
fire
in
her
mouth
and
that
she
was
a
witch
upon
this
she
was
apprehended
and
killed
immediately
she
was
cousin
jemison
says
she
was
present
at
the
execution
she
also
saw
one
other
killed
and
thrown
into
the
river
jeremiah
smith
of
leicester
near
beard
town
saw
an
indian
killed
by
his
five
brothers
who
struck
him
on
the
head
with
their
tomahawks
at
one
time
he
was
charged
with
being
a
witch
because
of
his
having
been
fortunate
enough
when
on
a
hunting
party
to
kill
a
number
of
deer
while
his
comrades
failed
of
taking
any
smith
also
saw
a
squaw
who
had
been
convicted
of
being
a
witch
killed
by
having
small
green
whips
burnt
till
they
were
red
hot
but
not
quite
coaled
and
thrust
down
her
throat
from
such
trifling
causes
thousands
have
lost
their
lives
and
notwithstanding
the
means
that
are
used
for
their
reformation
the
pagans
will
not
suffer
a
witch
to
live
of
the
manner
of
farming
as
practised
by
the
indian
women
it
is
well
known
that
the
squaws
have
all
the
labor
of
the
field
to
perform
and
almost
every
other
kind
of
hard
service
which
in
civil
society
is
performed
by
the
men
in
order
to
expedite
their
business
and
at
the
same
time
enjoy
each
other
company
they
all
work
together
in
one
field
or
at
whatever
job
they
may
have
on
hand
in
the
spring
they
choose
an
old
active
squaw
to
be
their
driver
and
overseer
when
at
labor
for
the
ensuing
year
she
accepts
the
honor
and
they
consider
themselves
bound
to
obey
her
when
the
time
for
planting
arrives
and
the
soil
is
prepared
the
squaws
are
assembled
in
the
morning
and
conducted
into
a
field
where
each
plants
one
row
they
then
go
into
the
next
field
plant
once
across
and
so
on
till
they
have
gone
through
the
tribe
if
any
remains
to
be
planted
they
again
commence
where
they
did
at
first
in
the
same
field
and
so
keep
on
till
the
whole
is
finished
by
this
rule
they
perform
their
labor
of
every
kind
and
every
jealousy
of
one
having
done
more
or
less
than
another
is
effectually
avoided
each
squaw
cuts
her
own
wood
but
it
is
all
brought
to
the
house
under
the
direction
of
the
overseer
each
bringing
one
back
load
of
their
method
of
computing
time
and
keeping
their
records
this
is
done
by
moons
and
winters
a
moon
is
a
month
and
the
time
from
the
end
of
one
winter
to
that
of
another
a
year
from
sunset
till
sunrise
they
say
that
the
sun
is
asleep
in
the
old
of
the
moon
when
it
does
not
shine
in
the
night
they
say
it
is
dead
they
rejoice
greatly
at
the
sight
of
the
new
moon
in
order
to
commemorate
great
events
and
preserve
the
chronology
of
them
the
war
chief
in
each
tribe
keeps
a
war
post
this
post
is
a
peeled
stick
of
timber
or
feet
high
that
is
erected
in
the
town
for
a
campaign
they
make
or
rather
the
chief
makes
a
perpendicular
red
mark
about
three
inches
long
and
half
an
inch
wide
on
the
opposite
side
from
this
for
a
scalp
they
make
a
red
cross
thus
on
another
side
for
a
prisoner
taken
they
make
a
red
cross
in
this
manner
x
with
a
head
or
dot
and
by
placing
such
significant
hireoglyphics
in
so
conspicuous
a
situation
they
are
enabled
to
ascertain
with
great
certainty
the
time
and
circumstances
of
past
events
hiokatoo
had
a
on
which
was
recorded
his
military
exploits
and
other
things
that
he
worth
preserving
anecdotes
hiokatoo
used
to
say
that
when
he
was
a
young
man
there
lived
in
the
same
tribe
with
him
an
old
indian
warrior
who
was
a
great
counsellor
by
the
name
of
buckinjehillish
having
with
great
fatigue
attended
the
council
when
it
was
deliberating
upon
war
declared
that
none
but
the
ignorant
made
war
but
that
the
wise
men
and
the
warriors
had
to
do
the
fighting
this
speech
exasperated
his
countrymen
to
such
a
degree
that
he
was
apprehended
and
tried
for
being
a
witch
on
the
account
of
his
having
lived
to
so
advanced
an
age
and
because
he
could
not
show
some
reason
why
he
had
not
died
before
he
was
sentenced
to
be
tomahawked
by
a
boy
on
the
spot
which
was
accordingly
done
in
the
last
war
an
indian
who
had
been
on
fatigue
called
at
a
commissary
and
begged
some
bread
he
was
sent
for
a
pail
of
water
before
he
received
it
and
while
he
was
absent
an
officer
told
the
commissary
to
put
a
piece
of
money
into
the
bread
and
observe
the
event
he
did
so
the
indian
took
the
bread
and
went
off
but
on
the
next
day
having
ate
his
bread
and
found
the
money
he
came
to
the
commissary
and
gave
him
the
same
as
the
officer
had
anticipated
little
beard
a
celebrated
indian
chief
having
arrived
to
a
very
advanced
age
died
at
his
town
on
the
genesee
river
about
the
first
of
june
and
was
buried
after
the
manner
of
burying
chiefs
in
his
life
time
he
had
been
quite
arbitrary
and
had
made
some
enemies
whom
he
hated
probably
and
was
not
loved
by
them
the
grave
however
deprives
envy
of
its
malignity
and
revenge
of
its
keenness
little
beard
had
been
dead
but
a
few
days
when
the
great
eclipse
of
the
sun
took
place
on
the
sixteenth
of
june
which
excited
in
the
indians
a
great
degree
of
astonishment
for
as
they
were
ignorant
of
astronomy
they
were
totally
unqualified
to
account
for
so
extraordinary
a
phenomenon
the
crisis
was
alarming
and
something
effectual
must
be
done
without
delay
to
remove
if
possible
the
cause
of
such
coldness
and
darkness
which
it
was
expected
would
increase
they
accordingly
ran
together
in
the
three
towns
near
the
genesee
river
and
after
a
short
consultation
agreed
that
little
beard
on
the
account
of
some
old
grudge
which
he
yet
cherished
towards
them
had
placed
himself
between
them
and
the
sun
in
order
that
their
corn
might
not
grow
and
so
reduce
them
to
a
state
of
starvation
having
thus
found
the
cause
the
next
thing
was
to
remove
it
which
could
only
be
done
the
use
of
powder
and
ball
upon
this
every
gun
and
rifle
was
loaded
and
a
firing
commenced
that
continued
without
cessation
till
the
old
fellow
left
his
seat
and
the
obscurity
was
entirely
removed
to
the
great
joy
of
the
ingenious
and
fortunate
indians
in
the
month
of
february
corn
planter
a
learned
pagan
chief
at
tonnewonta
died
of
common
sickness
he
had
received
a
liberal
education
and
was
held
in
high
estimation
in
his
town
and
tribe
by
both
parties
but
the
pagans
more
particularly
mourned
his
loss
deeply
and
seemed
entirely
unreconciled
they
imputed
his
death
to
witchcraft
and
charged
an
indian
by
the
name
of
prompit
with
the
crime
prompit
is
a
christian
indian
of
the
tuscarora
nation
who
has
lived
at
tonnewonta
a
number
of
years
where
he
has
built
a
himself
which
he
owns
and
is
considered
a
decent
respectable
man
about
two
weeks
after
the
death
of
corn
planter
prompit
happened
in
company
where
the
author
was
present
and
immediately
begun
to
converse
upon
that
subject
he
said
that
the
old
fashioned
indians
called
him
a
witch
believed
that
he
had
killed
corn
planter
and
had
said
that
they
would
kill
him
but
said
he
all
good
people
know
that
i
am
not
a
witch
and
that
i
am
clear
of
the
charge
likely
enough
they
will
kill
me
but
if
they
do
my
hands
are
clean
my
conscience
is
clear
and
i
shall
go
up
to
god
i
will
not
run
nor
hide
from
them
and
they
may
kill
me
if
they
choose
to
i
am
innocent
when
jesus
christ
enemies
said
he
wanted
to
kill
him
he
did
not
run
away
from
them
but
let
them
kill
him
and
why
should
i
run
away
from
my
enemies
how
the
affair
will
terminate

perpendicular
height
this
natural
curiosity
is
not
exceeded
by
any
thing
of
the
kind
in
the
western
country
except
the
cataract
at
niagara
from
the
middle
falls
the
banks
gradually
rise
till
you
ascend
the
river
half
a
mile
when
you
come
to
the
upper
falls
which
are
somewhat
rolling
feet
in
the
shape
of
a
harrow
above
this
the
banks
are
of
moderate
height
the
timber
from
the
lower
to
the
upper
falls
is
principally
pine
just
above
the
middle
falls
a
was
erected
this
season
by
ziba
hurd
and
alva
palmer
hunting
anecdote
in
november
capt
stephen
rolph
and
alva
palmer
drove
a
deer
into
genesee
river
a
short
distance
above
the
middle
falls
where
the
banks
were
so
steep
and
the
current
so
impetuous
that
it
could
not
regain
the
shore
and
consequently
was
precipitated
over
the
falls
one
hundred
and
ten
feet
into
the
gulph
below
the
hunters
ran
along
the
bank
below
the
falls
to
watch
the
fate
of
the
animal
expecting
it
would
be
dashed
in
pieces
but
to
their
great
astonishment
it
came
up
alive
and
by
swimming
across
a
small
eddy
reached
the
bank
almost
under
the
falls
and
as
it
stood
in
that
situation
capt
ralph
who
was
on
the
top
of
the
bank
shot
it
this
being
done
the
next
thing
to
be
considered
was
how
to
get
their
prize
the
rock
being
perpendicular
upwards
of
one
hundred
feet
would
not
admit
of
their
climbing
down
to
it
and
there
was
no
way
apparently
for
them
to
get
at
it
short
of
going
down
the
river
two
miles
to
the
lower
falls
and
then
by
creeping
between
the
water
and
the
precipice
they
might
possibly
reach
their
game
this
process
would
be
too
tedious
at
length
palmer
proposed
to
capt
rolph
and
heman
merwin
who
had
joined
them
that
if
they
would
make
a
windlas
and
fasten
it
to
a
couple
of
saplings
that
stood
near
and
then
procure
some
ropes
he
would
be
let
down
and
get
the
deer
the
apparatus
was
prepared
the
rope
was
tied
round
palmer
body
and
he
was
let
down
on
arriving
at
the
bottom
he
unloosed
himself
fastened
the
rope
round
the
deer
which
they
drew
up
and
then
threw
down
the
rope
in
which
he
fastened
himself
and
was
drawn
up
without
having
sustained
any
injury
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
rock
where
he
was
let
down
was
exactly
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
