the
symbolist
movement
in
literature
the
symbolist
movement
introduction
it
is
in
and
through
symbols
that
man
consciously
or
unconsciously
lives
works
and
has
his
being
those
ages
moreover
are
accounted
the
noblest
which
can
the
best
recognise
symbolical
worth
and
prize
it
highest
carlyle
without
symbolism
there
can
be
no
literature
indeed
not
even
language
what
are
words
themselves
but
symbols
almost
as
arbitrary
as
the
letters
which
compose
them
mere
sounds
of
the
voice
to
which
we
have
agreed
to
give
certain
significations
as
we
have
agreed
to
translate
these
sounds
by
those
combinations
of
letters
symbolism
began
with
the
first
words
uttered
by
the
first
man
as
he
named
every
living
thing
or
before
them
in
heaven
when
god
named
the
world
into
being
and
we
see
in
these
beginnings
precisely
what
symbolism
in
literature
really
is
a
form
of
expression
at
the
best
but
approximate
essentially
but
arbitrary
until
it
has
obtained
the
force
of
a
convention
for
an
unseen
reality
apprehended
by
the
consciousness
it
is
sometimes
permitted
to
us
to
hope
that
our
convention
is
indeed
the
reflection
rather
than
merely
the
sign
of
that
unseen
reality
we
have
done
much
if
we
have
found
a
recognisable
sign
a
symbol
says
comte
goblet
in
his
book
on
migration
of
symbols
might
be
defined
as
a
representation
which
does
not
aim
at
being
a
reproduction
originally
as
he
points
out
used
by
the
greeks
to
denote
the
two
halves
of
the
tablet
they
divided
between
themselves
as
a
pledge
of
hospitality
it
came
to
be
used
of
every
sign
formula
or
rite
by
which
those
initiated
in
any
mystery
made
themselves
secretly
known
to
one
another
gradually
the
word
extended
its
meaning
until
it
came
to
denote
every
conventional
representation
of
idea
by
form
of
the
unseen
by
the
visible
in
a
symbol
says
carlyle
there
is
concealment
and
yet
revelation
hence
therefore
by
silence
and
by
speech
acting
together
comes
a
double
significance
and
in
that
fine
chapter
of
resartus
he
goes
further
vindicating
for
the
word
its
full
value
in
the
symbol
proper
what
we
can
call
a
symbol
there
is
ever
more
or
less
distinctly
and
directly
some
embodiment
and
revelation
of
the
infinite
the
infinite
is
made
to
blend
itself
with
the
finite
to
stand
visible
and
as
it
were
attainable
there
it
is
in
such
a
sense
as
this
that
the
word
symbolism
has
been
used
to
describe
a
movement
which
during
the
last
generation
has
profoundly
influenced
the
course
of
french
literature
all
such
words
used
of
anything
so
living
variable
and
irresponsible
as
literature
are
as
symbols
themselves
must
so
often
be
mere
compromises
mere
indications
symbolism
as
seen
in
the
writers
of
our
day
would
have
no
value
if
it
were
not
seen
also
under
one
disguise
or
another
in
every
great
imaginative
writer
what
distinguishes
the
symbolism
of
our
day
from
the
symbolism
of
the
past
is
that
it
has
become
conscious
of
itself
in
a
sense
in
which
it
was
unconscious
even
in
gérard
de
nerval
to
whom
i
trace
the
particular
origin
of
the
literature
which
i
call
symbolist
the
forces
which
mould
the
thought
of
men
change
or
men
resistance
to
them
slackens
with
the
change
of
men
thought
comes
a
change
of
literature
alike
in
its
inmost
essence
and
in
its
outward
form
after
the
world
has
starved
its
soul
long
enough
in
the
contemplation
and
the
of
material
things
comes
the
turn
of
the
soul
and
with
it
comes
the
literature
of
which
i
write
in
this
volume
a
literature
in
which
the
visible
world
is
no
longer
a
reality
and
the
unseen
world
no
longer
a
dream
the
great
epoch
in
french
literature
which
preceded
this
epoch
was
that
of
the
offshoot
of
romanticism
which
produced
baudelaire
flaubert
the
goncourts
taine
zola
leconte
de
lisle
taine
was
the
philosopher
both
of
what
had
gone
before
him
and
of
what
came
immediately
after
so
that
he
seems
to
explain
at
once
flaubert
and
zola
it
was
the
age
of
science
the
age
of
material
things
and
words
with
that
facile
elasticity
which
there
is
in
them
did
miracles
in
the
exact
representation
of
everything
that
visibly
existed
exactly
as
it
existed
even
baudelaire
in
whom
the
spirit
is
always
an
uneasy
guest
at
the
orgie
of
life
had
a
certain
theory
of
realism
which
tortures
many
of
his
poems
into
strange
metallic
shapes
and
fills
them
with
imitative
odours
and
disturbs
them
with
a
too
deliberate
rhetoric
of
the
flesh
flaubert
the
one
impeccable
novelist
who
has
ever
lived
was
resolute
to
be
the
novelist
of
a
world
in
which
art
formal
art
was
the
only
escape
from
the
burden
of
reality
and
in
which
the
soul
was
of
use
mainly
as
the
agent
of
fine
literature
the
goncourts
caught
at
impressionism
to
render
the
fugitive
aspects
of
a
world
which
existed
only
as
a
thing
of
flat
spaces
and
angles
and
coloured
movement
in
which
sun
and
shadow
were
the
artists
as
moods
no
less
flitting
were
the
artists
of
the
merely
receptive
consciousnesses
of
men
and
women
zola
has
tried
to
build
in
brick
and
mortar
inside
the
covers
of
a
book
he
is
quite
sure
that
the
soul
is
a
nervous
fluid
which
he
is
quite
sure
some
man
of
science
is
about
to
catch
for
us
as
a
man
of
science
has
bottled
the
air
a
pretty
blue
liquid
leconte
de
lisle
turned
the
world
to
stone
but
saw
beyond
the
world
only
a
pause
from
misery
in
a
nirvana
never
subtilised
to
the
eastern
ecstasy
and
with
all
these
writers
form
aimed
above
all
things
at
being
precise
at
saying
rather
than
suggesting
at
saying
what
they
had
to
say
so
completely
that
nothing
remained
over
which
it
might
be
the
business
of
the
reader
to
divine
and
so
they
have
expressed
finally
a
certain
aspect
of
the
world
and
some
of
them
have
carried
style
to
a
point
beyond
which
the
style
that
says
rather
than
suggests
can
not
go
the
whole
of
that
movement
comes
to
a
splendid
funeral
in
de
heredia
sonnets
in
which
the
literature
of
form
says
its
last
word
and
dies
meanwhile
something
which
is
vaguely
called
decadence
had
come
into
being
that
name
rarely
used
with
any
precise
meaning
was
usually
either
hurled
as
a
reproach
or
hurled
back
as
a
defiance
it
pleased
some
young
men
in
various
countries
to
call
themselves
decadents
with
all
the
thrill
of
unsatisfied
virtue
masquerading
as
uncomprehended
vice
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
term
is
in
its
place
only
when
applied
to
style
to
that
ingenious
deformation
of
the
language
in
mallarmé
for
instance
which
can
be
compared
i
with
what
we
are
accustomed
to
call
the
greek
and
latin
of
the
decadence
no
doubt
perversity
of
form
and
perversity
often
found
together
and
among
the
lesser
men
especially
experiment
was
carried
far
not
only
in
the
direction
of
style
but
a
movement
which
in
this
sense
might
be
called
decadent
could
but
have
been
a
straying
aside
from
the
main
road
of
literature
nothing
not
even
conventional
virtue
is
so
provincial
as
conventional
vice
and
the
desire
to
bewilder
the
is
itself
the
interlude
half
a
of
decadence
diverted
the
attention
of
the
critics
while
something
more
serious
was
in
preparation
that
something
more
serious
has
crystallised
for
the
time
under
the
form
of
symbolism
in
which
art
returns
to
the
one
pathway
leading
through
beautiful
things
to
the
eternal
beauty
in
most
of
the
writers
whom
i
have
dealt
with
as
summing
up
in
themselves
all
that
is
best
in
symbolism
it
will
be
noticed
that
the
form
is
very
carefully
elaborated
and
seems
to
count
for
at
least
as
much
as
in
those
writers
of
whose
by
form
i
have
complained
here
however
all
this
elaboration
comes
from
a
very
different
motive
and
leads
to
other
ends
there
is
such
a
thing
as
perfecting
form
that
form
may
be
annihilated
all
the
art
of
verlaine
is
in
bringing
verse
to
a
bird
song
the
art
of
mallarmé
in
bringing
verse
to
the
song
of
an
orchestra
in
villiers
de
drama
becomes
an
embodiment
of
spiritual
forces
in
maeterlinck
not
even
their
embodiment
but
the
remote
sound
of
their
voices
it
is
all
an
attempt
to
spiritualise
literature
to
evade
the
old
bondage
of
rhetoric
the
old
bondage
of
exteriority
description
is
banished
that
beautiful
things
may
be
evoked
magically
the
regular
beat
of
verse
is
broken
in
order
that
words
may
fly
upon
subtler
wings
mystery
is
no
longer
feared
as
the
great
mystery
in
whose
midst
we
are
islanded
was
feared
by
those
to
whom
that
unknown
sea
was
only
a
great
void
we
are
coming
closer
to
nature
as
we
seem
to
shrink
from
it
with
something
of
horror
disdaining
to
catalogue
the
trees
of
the
forest
and
as
we
brush
aside
the
accidents
of
daily
life
in
which
men
and
women
imagine
that
they
are
alone
touching
reality
we
come
closer
to
humanity
to
everything
in
humanity
that
may
have
begun
before
the
world
and
may
outlast
it
here
then
in
this
revolt
against
exteriority
against
rhetoric
against
a
materialistic
tradition
in
this
endeavour
to
disengage
the
ultimate
essence
the
soul
of
whatever
exists
and
can
be
realized
by
the
consciousness
in
this
dutiful
waiting
upon
every
symbol
by
which
the
soul
of
things
can
be
made
visible
literature
bowed
down
by
so
many
burdens
may
at
last
attain
liberty
and
its
authentic
speech
in
attaining
this
liberty
it
accepts
a
heavier
burden
for
in
speaking
to
us
so
intimately
so
solemnly
as
only
religion
had
hitherto
spoken
to
us
it
becomes
itself
a
kind
of
religion
with
all
the
duties
and
responsibilities
of
the
sacred
ritual
balzac
the
first
man
who
has
completely
understood
balzac
is
rodin
and
it
has
taken
rodin
ten
years
to
realise
his
own
conception
france
has
refused
the
statue
in
which
a
novelist
is
represented
as
a
dreamer
to
whom
paris
is
not
so
much
paris
as
patmos
the
most
parisian
of
our
novelists
frenchmen
assure
you
it
is
more
than
a
hundred
years
since
balzac
was
born
a
hundred
years
is
a
long
time
in
which
to
be
misunderstood
with
admiration
in
choosing
the
name
of
the
for
a
series
of
novels
in
which
as
he
says
there
is
at
once
the
history
and
the
criticism
of
society
the
analysis
of
its
evils
and
the
discussion
of
its
principles
balzac
proposed
to
do
for
the
modern
world
what
dante
in
his
comedy
had
done
for
the
world
of
the
middle
ages
condemned
to
write
in
prose
and
finding
his
opportunity
in
that
restriction
he
created
for
himself
a
form
which
is
perhaps
the
nearest
equivalent
for
the
epic
or
the
poetic
drama
and
the
only
form
in
which
at
all
events
the
epic
is
now
possible
the
world
of
dante
was
materially
simple
compared
with
the
world
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
visible
world
had
not
yet
begun
to
exist
in
its
tyrannical
modern
sense
the
complications
of
the
soul
interested
only
the
schoolmen
and
were
a
part
of
theology
poetry
could
still
represent
an
age
and
yet
be
poetry
but
poetry
can
no
longer
represent
more
than
the
soul
of
things
it
had
taken
refuge
from
the
terrible
improvements
of
civilisation
in
a
divine
seclusion
where
it
sings
disregarding
the
many
voices
of
the
street
prose
comes
offering
its
infinite
capacity
for
detail
and
it
is
by
the
infinity
of
its
detail
that
the
novel
as
balzac
created
it
has
become
the
modern
epic
there
had
been
great
novels
indeed
before
balzac
but
no
great
novelist
and
the
novels
themselves
are
scarcely
what
we
should
call
by
that
name
the
interminable
and
its
companions
form
a
link
between
the
and
the
novel
and
from
them
developed
the
characteristic
in
narrative
letters
or
dialogue
as
we
see
it
in
marivaux
laclos
crebillon
crebillon
longer
works
including
sopha
with
their
conventional
paraphernalia
of
eastern
fable
are
extremely
tedious
but
in
two
short
pieces
nuit
et
le
and
hasard
du
coin
du
feu
he
created
a
model
of
witty
naughty
deplorably
natural
comedy
which
to
this
day
is
one
of
the
most
characteristic
french
forms
of
fiction
properly
however
it
is
a
form
of
the
drama
rather
than
of
the
novel
laclos
in
liaisons
dangereuses
a
masterpiece
which
scandalised
the
society
that
adored
crebillon
because
its
naked
human
truth
left
no
room
for
sentimental
excuses
comes
much
nearer
to
prefiguring
the
novel
as
stendhal
for
instance
is
afterward
to
conceive
it
but
still
preserves
the
awkward
traditional
form
of
letters
marivaux
had
indeed
already
seemed
to
suggest
the
novel
of
analysis
but
in
a
style
which
has
christened
a
whole
manner
of
writing
that
precisely
which
is
least
suited
to
the
writing
of
fiction
voltaire
la
of
diderot
are
tracts
or
satires
in
which
the
story
is
only
an
excuse
for
the
purpose
rousseau
too
has
his
purpose
even
in
nouvelle
héloise
but
it
is
a
humanising
purpose
and
with
that
book
the
novel
of
passion
comes
into
existence
and
along
with
it
the
descriptive
novel
yet
with
rousseau
this
result
is
an
accident
of
genius
we
can
not
call
him
a
novelist
and
we
find
him
abandoning
the
form
he
has
found
for
another
more
closely
personal
which
suits
him
better
restif
de
la
bretonne
who
followed
rousseau
at
a
distance
not
altogether
wisely
developed
the
form
of
autobiography
in
nicolas
a
book
of
which
the
most
significant
part
may
be
compared
with
hazlitt
morbid
and
even
mawkish
as
it
is
it
has
a
certain
uneasy
unwholesome
humanity
in
its
confessions
which
may
seem
to
have
set
a
fashion
only
too
scrupulously
followed
by
modern
french
novelists
meanwhile
the
abbé
prévost
one
great
story
lescaut
had
brought
for
once
a
purely
objective
study
of
an
incomparable
simplicity
into
the
midst
of
these
analyses
of
difficult
souls
and
then
we
return
to
the
confession
in
the
works
of
others
not
novelists
benjamin
constant
mme
de
staël
chateaubriand
in
corinne
at
once
we
are
in
the
romantic
movement
a
movement
which
begins
lyrically
among
poets
and
at
first
with
a
curious
disregard
of
the
more
human
part
of
humanity
balzac
worked
contemporaneously
with
the
romantic
movement
but
he
worked
outside
it
and
its
influence
upon
him
is
felt
only
in
an
occasional
like
the
episode
of
the
pirate
in
femme
de
trente
his
vision
of
humanity
was
essentially
a
poetic
vision
but
he
was
a
poet
whose
dreams
were
facts
knowing
that
as
mme
necker
has
said
the
novel
should
be
the
better
world
he
knew
also
that
the
novel
would
be
nothing
if
in
that
august
lie
it
were
not
true
in
details
and
in
the
he
proposed
to
himself
to
do
for
society
more
than
buffon
had
done
for
the
animal
world
there
is
but
one
animal
he
declares
in
his
with
a
confidence
which
darwin
has
not
yet
come
to
justify
but
there
exists
there
will
always
exist
social
species
as
there
are
zoological
species
thus
the
work
to
be
done
will
have
a
triple
form
men
women
and
things
that
is
to
say
human
beings
and
the
material
representation
which
they
give
to
their
thought

i
shall
need
to
be
no
more
than
the

thus
will
be
written
the
history
forgotten
by
so
many
historians
the
history
of
manners
but
that
is
not
all
for
passion
is
the
whole
of
humanity
in
realizing
clearly
the
drift
of
the
composition
it
will
be
seen
that
i
assign
to
facts
constant

open
or
secret
to
the
acts
of
individual
life
to
their
causes
and
principles
as
much
importance
as
historians
had
formerly
attached
to
the
events
of
the
public
life
of
nations

together
and
painted
as
they
are

one
of
his
definitions
of
the
task
he
has
undertaken
and
in
a
letter
to
mme
de
hanska
he
summarises
every
detail
of
his
scheme
the
des

represent
social
effects
without
a
single
situation
of
life
or
a
physiognomy
or
a
character
of
man
or

or
a
manner
of
life
or
a

or
a
social

or
a

of
france
or
anything
pertaining
to
childhood

or
maturity
politics
justice
or

having
been
forgotten
that
laid
down
the
history
of
the
human

the

of

in
all
its
details

have
the
base

the
demonstration
of
a
whole
system
i
shall
do
the
science
in
the
sur
les
forces
and
on
the
bases
of
this
palace
i
shall
have
traced
the
immense
arabesque
of
the
contes
quite
all
that
as
we
know
was
not
carried
out
but
there
in
its
intention
is
the
plan
and
after
twenty
years
work
the
main
part
of
it
certainly
was
carried
out
stated
with
this
precise
detail
it
has
something
of
a
scientific
air
as
of
a
too
deliberate
attempt
upon
the
sources
of
life
by
one
of
those
systematic
french
minds
which
are
so
much
more
logical
than
facts
but
there
is
one
little
phrase
to
be
noted
la
passion
est
toute
all
balzac
is
in
that
phrase
another
french
novelist
following
as
he
thought
the
example
of
the
comedy
has
endeavoured
to
build
up
a
history
of
his
own
time
with
even
greater
minuteness
but
is
no
more
than
system
zola
has
never
understood
that
detail
without
life
is
the
wardrobe
without
the
man
trying
to
outdo
balzac
on
his
own
ground
he
has
made
the
fatal
mistake
of
taking
him
only
on
his
systematic
side
which
in
balzac
is
subordinate
to
a
great
creative
intellect
an
incessant
burning
thought
about
men
and
women
a
passionate
human
curiosity
for
which
even
his
own
system
has
no
limits
the
misfortunes
of
the
the
priest
and
the
perfumer
he
says
in
his
taking
an
example
at
random
are
for
me
those
of
humanity
to
balzac
manners
are
but
the
vestment
of
life
it
is
life
that
he
seeks
and
life
to
him
it
is
his
own
word
is
but
the
vestment
of
thought
thought
is
at
the
root
of
all
his
work
a
whole
system
of
thought
in
which
philosophy
is
but
another
form
of
poetry
and
it
is
from
this
root
of
idea
that
the
springs
the
two
books
into
which
balzac
has
put
his
deepest
thought
the
two
books
which
he
himself
cared
for
the
most
are
and
of
he
said
i
write
it
for
myself
and
a
few
others
of
my
life
is
in
it
one
could
write
any
day
he
adds
only
in
a
lifetime
i
have
never
been
able
to
feel
that
is
altogether
a
success
it
lacks
the
breadth
of
life
it
is
glacial
true
he
aimed
at
producing
very
much
such
an
effect
and
it
is
indeed
full
of
a
strange
glittering
beauty
the
beauty
of
its
own
snows
but
i
find
in
it
at
the
same
time
something
a
little
factitious
a
sort
of
romanesque
not
altogether
unlike
the
sentimental
romanesque
of
novalis
it
has
not
done
the
impossible
in
humanising
abstract
speculation
in
fusing
mysticism
and
the
novel
but
for
the
student
of
balzac
it
has
extraordinary
interest
for
it
is
at
once
the
base
and
the
summit
of
the
in
a
letter
to
mme
de
hanska
written
in
four
years
after
had
been
begun
he
writes
i
am
not
orthodox
and
i
do
not
believe
in
the
roman
church
swedenborgianism
which
is
but
a
repetition
in
the
christian
sense
of
ancient
ideas
is
my
religion
with
this
addition
that
i
believe
in
the
incomprehensibility
of
god
is
a
prose
poem
in
which
the
most
abstract
part
of
that
mystical
system
which
swedenborg
perhaps
materialised
too
crudely
is
presented
in
a
white
light
under
a
single
superhuman
image
in
the
same
fundamental
conceptions
are
worked
out
in
the
study
of
a
perfectly
human
intellect
an
intelligent
gulf
as
he
truly
calls
it
a
sober
and
concise
history
of
ideas
in
their
devouring
action
upon
a
feeble
physical
nature
in
these
two
books
we
see
directly
and
not
through
the
coloured
veil
of
human
life
the
mind
in
the
abstract
of
a
thinker
whose
power
over
humanity
was
the
power
of
abstract
thought
they
show
this
novelist
who
has
invented
the
description
of
society
by
whom
the
visible
world
has
been
more
powerfully
felt
than
by
any
other
novelist
striving
to
penetrate
the
correspondences
which
exist
between
the
human
and
the
celestial
existence
he
would
pursue
the
soul
to
its
last
before
it
takes
flight
from
the
body
further
on
its
disembodied
flight
he
would
find
out
god
as
he
comes
nearer
and
nearer
to
finding
out
the
secret
of
life
and
realising
as
he
does
so
profoundly
that
there
is
but
one
substance
but
one
principle
of
life
one
vegetable
one
animal
but
a
continual
intercourse
the
world
is
alive
with
meaning
for
him
a
more
intimate
meaning
than
it
has
for
others
the
least
flower
is
a
thought
a
life
which
corresponds
to
some
lineaments
of
the
great
whole
of
which
he
has
the
constant
intuition
and
so
in
his
concerns
with
the
world
he
will
find
spirit
everywhere
nothing
for
him
will
be
inert
matter
everything
will
have
its
particle
of
the
universal
life
one
of
those
divine
spies
for
whom
the
world
has
no
secrets
he
will
be
neither
pessimist
nor
optimist
he
will
accept
the
world
as
a
man
accepts
the
woman
whom
he
loves
as
much
for
her
defects
as
for
her
virtues
loving
the
world
for
its
own
sake
he
will
find
it
always
beautiful
equally
beautiful
in
all
its
parts
now
let
us
look
at
the
programme
which
he
traced
for
the
comedy
let
us
realise
it
in
the
light
of
this
philosophy
and
we
are
at
the
beginning
of
a
conception
of
what
the
really
is
this
visionary
then
who
had
apprehended
for
himself
an
idea
of
god
set
himself
to
interpret
human
life
more
elaborately
than
any
one
else
he
has
been
praised
for
his
patient
observation
people
have
thought
they
praised
him
in
calling
him
a
realist
it
has
been
discussed
how
far
his
imitation
of
life
was
the
literal
truth
of
the
photograph
but
to
balzac
the
word
realism
was
an
insult
writing
his
novels
at
the
rate
of
eighteen
hours
a
day
in
a
feverish
solitude
he
never
had
the
time
to
observe
patiently
it
is
humanity
seen
in
a
mirror
the
humanity
which
comes
to
the
great
dreamers
the
great
poets
humanity
as
shakespeare
saw
it
and
so
in
him
as
in
all
the
great
artists
there
is
something
more
than
nature
a
divine
excess
this
something
more
than
nature
should
be
the
aim
of
the
artist
not
merely
the
accident
which
happens
to
him
against
his
will
we
require
of
him
a
world
like
our
own
but
a
world
infinitely
more
vigorous
interesting
profound
more
beautiful
with
that
kind
of
beauty
which
nature
finds
of
itself
for
art
it
is
the
quality
of
great
creative
art
to
give
us
so
much
life
that
we
are
almost
overpowered
by
it
as
by
an
air
almost
too
vigorous
to
breathe
the
exuberance
of
creation
which
makes
the
sibyl
of
michelangelo
something
more
than
human
which
makes
lear
something
more
than
human
in
one
kind
or
another
of
divinity
balzac
novels
are
full
of
strange
problems
and
great
passions
turned
aside
from
nothing
which
presented
itself
in
nature
and
his
mind
was
always
turbulent
with
the
magnificent
contrasts
and
caprices
of
fate
a
devouring
passion
of
thought
burned
on
all
the
situations
by
which
humanity
expresses
itself
in
its
flight
from
the
horror
of
immobility
to
say
that
the
situations
which
he
chose
are
often
romantic
is
but
to
say
that
he
followed
the
soul
and
the
senses
faithfully
on
their
strangest
errands
our
probable
novelists
of
are
afraid
of
whatever
emotion
might
be
misinterpreted
in
a
gentleman
believing
as
we
do
now
in
nerves
and
a
fatalistic
heredity
we
have
left
but
little
room
for
the
dignity
and
disturbance
of
violent
emotion
to
balzac
humanity
had
not
changed
since
the
days
when
œdipus
was
blind
and
philoctetes
cried
in
the
cave
and
equally
great
miseries
were
still
possible
to
mortals
though
they
were
french
and
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
thus
he
creates
like
the
poets
a
humanity
more
logical
than
average
life
more
typical
more
among
the
passions
and
having
in
its
veins
an
energy
almost
more
than
human
he
realised
as
the
greeks
did
that
human
life
is
made
up
of
elemental
passions
and
necessity
but
he
was
the
first
to
realise
that
in
the
modern
world
the
pseudonym
of
necessity
is
money
money
and
the
passions
rule
the
world
of
his
and
at
the
root
of
the
passions
determining
their
action
he
saw
those
nervous
fluids
or
that
unknown
substance
which
in
default
of
another
term
we
must
call
the
will
no
word
returns
oftener
to
his
pen
for
him
the
problem
is
invariable
man
has
a
given
quantity
of
energy
each
man
a
different
quantity
how
will
he
spend
it
a
novel
is
the
determination
in
action
of
that
problem
and
he
is
equally
interested
in
every
form
of
energy
in
every
egoism
so
long
as
it
is
fiercely
itself
this
with
the
force
rather
than
with
any
of
its
manifestations
gives
him
his
singular
impartiality
his
absolute
lack
of
prejudice
for
it
gives
him
the
advantage
of
an
abstract
point
of
view
the
unchanging
fulcrum
for
a
lever
which
turns
in
every
direction
and
as
nothing
once
set
vividly
in
motion
by
any
form
of
human
activity
is
without
interest
for
him
he
makes
every
point
of
his
vast
chronicle
of
human
affairs
equally
interesting
to
his
readers
baudelaire
has
observed
profoundly
that
every
character
in
the
has
something
of
balzac
has
genius
to
himself
his
own
genius
was
entirely
expressed
in
that
word
will
it
recurs
constantly
in
his
letters
men
of
will
are
rare
he
cries
and
at
a
time
when
he
had
turned
night
into
day
for
his
labour
i
rise
every
night
with
a
keener
will
than
that
of
yesterday
nothing
wearies
me
he
says
neither
waiting
nor
happiness
he
exhausts
the
printers
whose
fingers
can
hardly
keep
pace
with
his
brain
they
call
him
he
reports
proudly
a
and
he
tries
to
express
himself
i
have
always
had
in
me
something
i
know
not
what
which
made
me
do
differently
from
others
and
with
me
fidelity
is
perhaps
no
more
than
pride
having
only
myself
to
rely
upon
i
have
had
to
strengthen
to
build
up
that
self
there
is
a
scene
in
cousine
which
gives
precisely
own
sentiment
of
the
supreme
value
of
energy
the
baron
hulot
ruined
on
every
side
and
by
his
own
fault
goes
to
josépha
a
mistress
who
had
cast
him
off
in
the
time
of
his
prosperity
and
asks
her
to
lodge
him
for
a
few
days
in
a
garret
she
laughs
pities
and
then
questions
him
vrai

josépha

grand

on

une
canaille
mais
on
a
du

the
cry
is
balzac
and
it
is
a
characteristic
part
of
his
genius
to
have
given
it
that
ironical
force
by
uttering
it
through
the
mouth
of
a
josépha
the
joy
of
the
human
organism
at
its
highest
point
of
activity
that
is
what
interests
him
supremely
how
passionate
how
moving
he
becomes
whenever
he
has
to
speak
of
a
real
passion
a
mania
whether
of
a
lover
for
his
mistress
of
a
philosopher
for
his
idea
of
a
miser
for
his
gold
of
a
jew
dealer
for
masterpieces
his
style
clarifies
his
words
become
flesh
and
blood
he
is
the
lyric
poet
and
for
him
every
idealism
is
equal
the
gourmandise
of
pons
is
not
less
serious
nor
less
sympathetic
not
less
perfectly
realised
than
the
search
of
claës
after
the
absolute
the
great
and
terrible
clamour
of
egoism
is
the
voice
to
which
he
is
always
attentive
those
eloquent
faces
proclaiming
a
soul
abandoned
to
an
idea
as
to
a
remorse
are
the
faces
with
whose
history
he
concerns
himself
he
drags
to
light
the
hidden
joys
of
the
and
with
especial
delight
those
that
are
hidden
deepest
under
the
most
deceptive
coverings
he
deifies
them
for
their
energy
he
fashions
the
world
of
his
in
their
service
as
the
real
world
exists
all
but
passive
to
be
the
pasture
of
these
supreme
egoists
in
all
that
he
writes
of
life
balzac
seeks
the
soul
but
it
is
the
soul
as
nervous
fluid
the
executive
soul
not
the
contemplative
soul
that
with
rare
exceptions
he
seeks
he
would
surprise
the
motive
force
of
life
that
is
his
de
he
figures
it
to
himself
as
almost
a
substance
and
he
is
the
alchemist
on
its
track
can
man
by
thinking
find
out
god
or
life
he
would
have
added
and
he
would
have
answered
the
question
with
at
least
a
perhaps
and
of
this
visionary
this
abstract
thinker
it
must
be
said
that
his
thought
translates
itself
always
into
terms
of
life
pose
before
him
a
purely
mental
problem
and
he
will
resolve
it
by
a
scene
in
which
the
problem
literally
works
itself
out
it
is
the
quality
proper
to
the
novelist
but
no
novelist
ever
employed
this
quality
with
such
persistent
activity
and
at
the
same
time
subordinated
faction
so
constantly
to
the
idea
with
him
action
has
always
a
mental
basis
is
never
suffered
to
intrude
for
its
own
sake
he
prefers
that
an
episode
should
seem
in
itself
tedious
rather
than
it
should
have
an
illogical
interest
it
may
be
for
he
is
a
frenchman
that
his
episodes
are
sometimes
too
logical
there
are
moments
when
he
becomes
unreal
because
he
wishes
to
be
too
systematic
that
is
to
be
real
by
measure
he
would
never
have
understood
the
method
of
tolstoi
a
very
stealthy
method
of
surprising
life
to
tolstoi
life
is
always
the
cunning
enemy
whom
one
must
lull
asleep
or
noose
by
an
unexpected
lasso
he
brings
in
little
detail
after
little
detail
seeming
to
insist
on
the
insignificance
of
each
in
order
that
it
may
pass
almost
unobserved
and
be
realised
only
after
it
has
passed
it
is
his
way
of
disarming
the
suspiciousness
of
life
but
balzac
will
make
no
circuit
aims
at
an
open
and
an
unconditional
triumph
over
nature
thus
when
he
triumphs
he
triumphs
signally
and
action
in
his
books
is
perpetually
crystallising
into
some
phrase
like
the
single
lines
of
dante
or
some
brief
scene
in
which
a
whole
entanglement
comes
sharply
and
suddenly
to
a
luminous
point
i
will
give
no
instance
for
i
should
have
to
quote
from
every
volume
i
wish
rather
to
remind
myself
that
there
are
times
when
the
last
fine
shade
of
a
situation
seems
to
have
escaped
even
then
the
failure
is
often
more
apparent
than
real
a
slight
bungling
in
the
machinery
of
illusion
look
through
the
phrase
and
you
will
find
the
truth
there
perfectly
explicit
on
the
other
side
of
it
for
it
can
not
be
denied
balzac
style
as
style
is
imperfect
it
has
life
and
it
has
an
idea
and
it
has
variety
there
are
moments
when
it
attains
a
rare
and
perfectly
individual
beauty
as
when
in
cousin
pons
we
read
of
cette
prédisposition
aux
recherches
qui

vérité
qui
le
regard
en
riant

à
la
marge
du
puits
sous
le
jasmin
de
la
cour
but
i
am
far
less
sure
that
a
student
of
balzac
would
recognise
him
in
this
sentence
than
that
he
would
recognise
the
writer
of
this
other
des
larmes
de
pudeur
qui
roulèrent
entre
les
beaux
cils
de
madame
hulot
arrêtèrent
net
le
garde
national
it
is
in
such
passages
that
the
failure
in
style
is
equivalent
to
a
failure
in
psychology
that
his
style
should
lack
symmetry
subordination
the
formal
virtues
of
form
is
in
my
eyes
a
less
serious
fault
i
have
often
considered
whether
in
the
novel
perfect
form
is
a
good
or
even
a
possible
thing
if
the
novel
is
to
be
what
balzac
made
it
history
added
to
poetry
a
novelist
with
style
will
not
look
at
life
with
an
entirely
naked
vision
he
sees
through
coloured
glasses
human
life
and
human
manners
are
too
various
too
moving
to
be
brought
into
the
fixity
of
a
quite
formal
order
there
will
come
a
moment
constantly
when
style
must
suffer
or
the
closeness
and
clearness
of
narration
must
be
sacrificed
some
minute
exception
of
action
or
psychology
must
lose
its
natural
place
or
its
full
emphasis
balzac
with
his
rapid
and
accumulating
mind
without
the
patience
oft
selection
and
without
the
desire
to
select
where
selection
means
leaving
out
something
good
in
itself
if
not
good
in
its
place
never
hesitates
and
his
parenthesis
comes
in
and
often
it
is
into
these
parentheses
that
he
puts
the
profoundest
part
of
his
thought
yet
ready
as
balzac
is
to
neglect
the
story
for
the
philosophy
whenever
it
seems
to
him
necessary
to
do
so
he
would
never
have
admitted
that
a
form
of
the
novel
is
possible
in
which
the
story
shall
be
no
more
than
an
excuse
for
the
philosophy
that
was
because
he
was
a
great
creator
and
not
merely
a
philosophical
thinker
because
he
dealt
in
flesh
and
blood
and
knew
that
the
passions
in
action
can
teach
more
to
the
philosopher
and
can
justify
the
artist
more
fully
than
all
the
unacting
intellect
in
the
world
he
knew
that
though
life
without
thought
was
no
more
than
the
portion
of
a
dog
yet
thoughtful
life
was
more
than
lifeless
thought
and
the
dramatist
more
than
the
commentator
and
i
can
not
help
feeling
assured
that
the
latest
novelists
without
a
story
whatever
other
merits
they
certainly
have
are
lacking
in
the
power
to
create
characters
to
express
a
philosophy
in
action
and
that
the
form
which
they
have
found
however
valuable
it
may
be
is
the
result
of
this
failure
and
not
either
a
great
refusal
or
a
new
vision
the
novel
as
balzac
conceived
it
has
created
the
modern
novel
but
no
modern
novelist
has
followed
for
none
has
been
able
to
follow
balzac
on
his
own
lines
even
those
who
have
tried
to
follow
him
most
closely
have
sooner
or
later
branched
off
in
one
direction
or
another
most
in
the
direction
indicated
by
stendhal
stendhal
has
written
one
book
which
is
a
masterpiece
unique
in
its
kind
rouge
et
le
noir
a
second
which
is
full
of
admirable
things
chartreuse
de
parme
a
book
of
profound
criticism
et
shakspeare
and
a
cold
and
penetrating
study
of
the
physiology
of
love
by
the
side
of
which
balzac
du
is
a
mere
he
discovered
for
himself
and
for
others
after
him
a
method
of
unemotional
minute
slightly
ironical
analysis
which
has
fascinated
modern
minds
partly
because
it
has
seemed
to
dispense
with
those
difficulties
of
creation
of
creation
in
the
block
which
the
triumphs
of
balzac
have
only
accentuated
goriot
valérie
marneffe
pons
grandet
madame
de
mortsauf
even
are
called
up
before
us
after
the
same
manner
as
othello
or
don
quixote
their
actions
express
them
so
significantly
that
they
seem
to
be
independent
of
their
creator
balzac
stakes
all
upon
each
creation
and
leaves
us
no
choice
but
to
accept
or
reject
each
as
a
whole
precisely
as
we
should
a
human
being
we
do
not
know
all
the
secrets
of
their
consciousness
any
more
than
we
know
all
the
secrets
of
the
consciousness
of
our
friends
but
we
have
only
so
say
valérie
and
the
woman
is
before
us
stendhal
on
the
contrary
undresses
julien
soul
in
public
with
a
deliberate
and
fascinating
effrontery
there
is
not
a
vein
of
which
he
does
not
trace
the
course
not
a
wrinkle
to
which
he
does
not
point
not
a
nerve
which
he
does
not
touch
to
the
quick
we
know
everything
that
passed
through
his
mind
to
result
probably
in
some
significant
inaction
and
at
the
end
of
the
book
we
know
as
much
about
that
particular
intelligence
as
the
anatomist
knows
about
the
body
which
he
has
dissected
but
the
life
has
gone
out
of
the
body
and
have
we
after
all
captured
a
living
soul
i
should
be
the
last
to
say
that
julien
sorel
is
not
a
creation
but
he
is
not
a
creation
after
the
order
of
balzac
it
is
a
difference
of
kind
and
if
we
look
carefully
at
frédéric
moreau
and
madame
gervaisais
and
the
abbé
mouret
we
shall
see
that
these
also
profoundly
different
as
flaubert
and
goncourt
and
zola
are
from
stendhal
are
yet
more
profoundly
more
radically
different
from
the
creations
of
balzac
balzac
takes
a
primary
passion
puts
it
into
a
human
body
and
sets
it
to
work
itself
out
in
visible
action
but
since
stendhal
novelists
have
persuaded
themselves
that
the
primary
passions
are
a
little
common
or
noisy
or
a
little
heavy
to
handle
and
they
have
concerned
themselves
with
passions
tempered
by
reflection
and
the
sensations
of
elaborate
brains
it
was
stendhal
who
substituted
the
brain
for
the
heart
as
the
of
the
novel
not
the
brain
as
balzac
conceived
it
a
of
action
the
mainspring
of
passion
the
force
by
which
a
nature
directs
its
accumulated
energy
but
a
sterile
sort
of
brain
set
at
a
great
distance
from
the
heart
whose
rhythm
is
too
faint
to
disturb
it
we
have
been
intellectualising
upon
stendhal
ever
since
until
the
persons
of
the
modern
novel
have
come
to
resemble
those
diaphanous
with
heads
and
the
merest
tufts
of
bodies
which
float
up
and
down
in
the
aquarium
at
naples
thus
coming
closer
as
it
seems
to
what
is
called
reality
in
this
banishment
of
great
emotions
and
this
attention
upon
the
sensations
modern
analytic
novelists
are
really
getting
further
and
further
from
that
life
which
is
the
one
certain
thing
in
the
world
balzac
employs
all
his
detail
to
call
up
a
tangible
world
about
his
men
and
women
not
perhaps
understanding
the
full
power
of
detail
as
psychology
as
flaubert
is
to
understand
it
but
after
all
his
detail
is
only
the
background
of
the
picture
and
there
stepping
out
of
the
canvas
as
the
sombre
people
of
velazquez
step
out
of
their
canvases
at
the
prado
is
the
living
figure
looking
into
your
eyes
with
eyes
that
respond
to
you
like
a
mirror
the
novels
of
balzac
are
full
of
electric
fluid
to
take
up
one
of
them
is
to
feel
the
shock
of
life
as
one
feels
it
on
touching
certain
magnetic
hands
to
turn
over
volume
after
volume
is
like
wandering
through
the
streets
of
a
great
city
at
that
hour
of
the
night
when
human
activity
is
at
its
full
there
is
a
particular
kind
of
excitement
inherent
in
the
very
aspect
of
a
modern
city
of
london
or
paris
in
the
mere
sensation
of
being
in
its
midst
in
the
sight
of
all
those
active
and
fatigued
faces
which
pass
so
rapidly
of
those
long
and
endless
streets
full
of
houses
each
of
which
is
like
the
body
of
a
multiform
soul
looking
out
through
the
eyes
of
many
windows
there
is
something
intoxicating
in
the
lights
the
movement
of
shadows
under
the
lights
the
vast
and
billowy
sound
of
that
shadowy
movement
and
there
is
something
more
than
this
mere
unconscious
action
upon
the
nerves
every
step
in
a
great
city
is
a
step
into
an
unknown
world
a
new
future
is
possible
at
every
street
corner
i
never
know
when
i
go
out
into
one
of
those
crowded
streets
but
that
the
whole
course
of
my
life
may
be
changed
before
i
return
to
the
house
i
have
quitted
i
am
writing
these
lines
in
madrid
to
which
i
have
come
suddenly
after
a
long
quiet
in
andalusia
and
i
feel
already
a
new
pulse
in
my
blood
a
keener
consciousness
of
life
and
a
sharper
human
curiosity
even
in
seville
i
knew
that
i
should
see
in
the
same
streets
hardly
changed
since
the
middle
ages
the
same
people
that
i
had
seen
but
here
there
are
new
possibilities
all
the
exciting
accidents
of
the
modern
world
of
a
population
always
changing
of
a
city
into
which
civilisation
has
brought
all
its
unrest
and
as
i
walk
in
these
broad
windy
streets
and
see
these
people
whom
i
hardly
recognise
for
spaniards
so
awake
and
so
hybrid
are
they
i
have
felt
the
sense
of
balzac
coming
back
into
my
veins
at
cordova
he
was
unthinkable
at
cadiz
i
could
realise
only
his
large
universal
outlines
vague
as
the
murmur
of
the
sea
here
i
feel
him
he
speaks
the
language
i
am
talking
he
sums
up
the
life
in
whose
midst
i
find
myself
for
balzac
is
the
equivalent
of
great
cities
he
is
bad
reading
for
solitude
for
he
fills
the
mind
with
the
nostalgia
of
cities
when
a
man
speaks
to
me
familiarly
of
balzac
i
know
already
something
of
the
man
with
whom
i
have
to
do
the
physiognomy
of
women
does
not
begin
before
the
age
of
thirty
he
has
said
and
perhaps
before
that
age
no
one
can
really
understand
balzac
few
young
people
care
for
him
for
there
is
nothing
in
him
that
appeals
to
the
senses
except
through
the
intellect
not
many
women
care
for
him
supremely
for
it
is
part
of
his
method
to
express
sentiments
through
facts
and
not
facts
through
sentiments
but
it
is
natural
that
he
should
be
the
favourite
reading
of
men
of
the
world
of
those
men
of
the
world
who
have
the
distinction
of
their
kind
for
he
supplies
the
key
of
the
enigma
which
they
are
studying
the
life
of
balzac
was
one
long
labour
in
which
time
money
and
circumstances
were
all
against
him
in
he
writes
i
have
lately
spent
days
in
my
study
without
leaving
it
i
took
the
air
only
at
that
window
which
dominates
paris
which
i
mean
to
dominate
and
he
exults
in
the
labour
if
there
is
any
glory
in
that
i
alone
could
accomplish
such
a
feat
he
symbolises
the
course
of
his
life
in
comparing
it
to
the
sea
beating
against
a
rock
one
flood
another
bears
me
along
with
it
i
am
dashed
against
a
rock
i
recover
myself
and
go
on
to
another
reef
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
my
brain
is
on
fire
i
shall
die
in
the
trenches
of
the
intellect
balzac
like
scott
died
under
the
weight
of
his
debts
and
it
would
seem
if
one
took
him
at
his
word
that
the
whole
of
the
was
written
for
money
in
the
modern
world
as
he
himself
realised
more
clearly
than
any
one
money
is
more
often
a
symbol
than
an
entity
and
it
can
be
the
symbol
of
every
desire
for
balzac
money
was
the
key
of
his
earthly
paradise
it
meant
leisure
to
visit
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
at
the
end
it
meant
the
possibility
of
marrying
her
there
were
only
two
women
in
balzac
life
one
a
woman
much
older
than
himself
of
whom
he
wrote
on
her
death
to
the
other
she
was
a
mother
a
friend
a
family
a
companion
a
counsel
she
made
the
writer
she
consoled
the
young
man
she
formed
his
taste
she
wept
like
a
sister
she
laughed
she
came
every
day
like
a
healing
slumber
to
put
sorrow
to
sleep
the
other
was
mme
de
hanska
whom
he
married
in
three
months
before
his
death
he
had
loved
her
for
twenty
years
she
was
married
and
lived
in
poland
it
was
only
at
rare
intervals
that
he
was
able
to
see
her
and
then
very
briefly
but
his
letters
to
her
published
since
his
death
are
a
simple
perfectly
individual
daily
record
of
a
great
passion
for
twenty
years
he
existed
on
a
divine
certainty
without
a
future
and
almost
without
a
present
but
we
see
the
force
of
that
sentiment
passing
into
his
work
is
its
ecstasy
everywhere
is
its
human
shadow
it
refines
his
strength
it
gives
him
surprising
intuitions
it
gives
him
all
that
was
wanting
to
his
genius
mme
de
hanska
is
the
heroine
of
the
comedy
as
beatrice
is
the
heroine
of
the
a
great
lover
to
whom
love
as
well
as
every
other
passion
and
the
whole
visible
world
was
an
idea
a
flaming
spiritual
perception
balzac
enjoyed
the
vast
happiness
of
the
idealist
contentedly
joyously
he
sacrificed
every
petty
enjoyment
to
the
idea
of
love
the
idea
of
fame
and
to
that
need
of
the
organism
to
exercise
its
forces
which
is
the
only
definition
of
genius
i
do
not
know
among
the
lives
of
men
of
letters
a
life
better
filled
or
more
appropriate
a
young
man
who
for
a
short
time
was
his
secretary
declared
i
would
not
live
your
life
for
the
fame
of
napoleon
and
of
byron
combined
the
comte
de
gramont
did
not
realise
as
the
world
in
general
does
not
realise
that
to
the
man
of
creative
energy
creation
is
at
once
a
necessity
and
a
joy
and
to
the
lover
hope
in
absence
is
the
elixir
of
life
balzac
tasted
more
than
all
earthly
pleasures
as
he
sat
there
in
his
attic
creating
the
world
over
again
that
he
might
lay
it
at
the
feet
of
a
woman
certainly
to
him
there
was
no
tedium
in
life
for
there
was
no
hour
without
its
vivid
employment
and
no
moment
in
which
to
perceive
the
most
desolate
of
all
certainties
that
hope
is
in
the
past
his
death
was
as
fortunate
as
his
life
he
died
at
the
height
of
his
powers
at
the
height
of
his
fame
at
the
moment
of
the
fulfilment
of
his
happiness
and
perhaps
of
the
too
sudden
relief
of
that
delicate
burden
prosper
mérimée
stendhal
has
left
us
a
picture
of
mérimée
as
a
young
man
in
a
grey
very
ugly
and
with
a
nose
this
young
man
had
something
insolent
and
extremely
unpleasant
about
him
his
eyes
small
and
without
expression
had
always
the
same
look
and
this
look
was
such
was
my
first
impression
of
the
best
of
my
present
friends
i
am
not
too
sure
of
his
heart
but
i
am
sure
of
his
talents
it
is
le
comte
gazul
now
so
well
known
a
letter
from
him
which
came
to
me
last
week
made
me
happy
for
two
days
his
mother
has
a
good
deal
of
french
wit
and
a
superior
intelligence
like
her
son
it
seems
to
me
that
she
might
give
way
to
emotion
once
a
year
there
painted
by
a
and
disinterested
friend
is
a
picture
of
mérimée
almost
from
his
own
point
of
view
or
at
least
as
he
would
himself
have
painted
the
picture
how
far
is
it
in
its
insistence
on
the
une
fois
par
an
on
the
subordination
of
natural
feelings
to
a
somewhat
disdainful
aloofness
the
real
mérimée
early
in
life
mérimée
adopted
his
theory
fixed
his
attitude
and
to
the
end
of
his
life
he
seemed
to
those
about
him
to
have
walked
along
the
path
he
had
chosen
almost
without
a
deviation
he
went
to
england
at
the
age
of
to
spain
four
years
later
and
might
seem
to
have
been
drawn
naturally
to
those
two
countries
to
which
he
was
to
return
so
often
by
natural
affinities
of
temper
and
manner
it
was
the
english
manner
that
he
liked
that
came
naturally
to
him
the
correct
unmoved
exterior
which
is
a
kind
of
positive
strength
not
to
be
broken
by
any
onslaught
of
events
or
emotions
and
in
spain
he
found
an
equally
positive
animal
acceptance
of
things
as
they
are
which
satisfied
his
profound
restrained
really
pagan
senusality
pagan
in
the
hard
sense
from
the
beginning
he
was
a
student
of
art
of
history
of
human
nature
and
we
find
him
enjoying
in
his
deliberate
keen
way
the
studied
diversions
of
the
student
body
and
soul
each
kept
exactly
in
its
place
each
provided
for
without
partiality
he
entered
upon
literature
by
a
mystification
théâtre
de
clara
gazul
a
book
of
plays
supposed
to
be
translated
from
a
living
spanish
dramatist
and
he
followed
it
by
guzla
another
mystification
a
book
of
prose
ballads
supposed
to
be
translated
from
the
illyrian
and
these
mystifications
like
the
forgeries
of
chatterton
contain
perhaps
the
most
sincere
the
most
undisguised
emotion
which
he
ever
permitted
himself
to
express
so
secure
did
he
feel
of
the
heart
behind
the
pearl
necklace
of
the
spanish
actress
who
travesties
his
own
face
in
the
frontispiece
to
the
one
and
so
remote
from
himself
did
he
feel
the
bearded
gentleman
to
be
who
sits
on
the
ground
holding
his
lyre
or
in
the
frontispiece
to
the
other
then
came
a
historical
novel
the
du
règne
de
charles
before
he
discovered
as
if
by
accident
precisely
what
it
was
he
was
meant
to
do
the
short
story
then
he
drifted
into
history
became
inspector
of
ancient
monuments
and
helped
to
save
vézelay
among
other
good
deeds
toward
art
done
in
his
cold
systematic
after
all
satisfactory
manner
he
travelled
at
almost
regular
intervals
not
only
in
spain
and
england
but
in
corsica
in
greece
and
asia
minor
in
italy
in
hungary
in
bohemia
usually
with
a
definite
scholarly
object
and
always
with
an
alert
attention
to
everything
that
came
in
his
way
to
the
manners
of
people
their
national
characters
their
differences
from
one
another
an
intimate
friend
of
the
countess
de
montijo
the
mother
of
the
empress
eugénie
he
was
a
friend
not
a
courtier
at
the
court
of
the
third
empire
he
was
elected
to
the
academy
mainly
for
his
sur
romaine
a
piece
of
dry
history
and
immediately
scandalised
his
supporters
by
publishing
a
story
guillot
which
was
taken
for
a
veiled
attack
on
religion
and
on
morals
soon
after
his
imagination
seemed
to
flag
he
abandoned
himself
perhaps
a
little
wearily
more
and
more
to
facts
to
the
facts
of
history
and
learning
learned
russian
and
translated
poushkin
and
tourguenieff
and
died
in
at
cannes
perhaps
less
satisfied
with
himself
than
most
men
who
have
done
in
their
lives
far
less
exactly
what
they
have
intended
to
do
i
have
theories
about
the
very
smallest
things
gloves
boots
and
the
like
says
mérimée
in
one
of
his
letters
idées
as
he
adds
with
emphasis
in
another
precise
opinions
lead
easily
to
prejudices
and
mérimée
who
prided
himself
on
the
really
very
logical
quality
of
his
mind
put
himself
somewhat
deliberately
into
the
hands
of
his
prejudices
thus
he
hated
religion
distrusted
priests
would
not
let
himself
be
carried
away
by
any
instinct
of
admiration
would
not
let
himself
do
the
things
which
he
had
the
power
to
do
because
his
other
critical
self
came
mockingly
behind
him
suggesting
that
very
few
things
were
altogether
worth
doing
there
is
nothing
that
i
despise
and
even
detest
so
much
as
humanity
in
general
he
confesses
in
a
letter
and
it
is
with
a
certain
that
he
defines
the
only
kind
of
society
in
which
he
found
himself
at
home
with
unpretentious
people
whom
i
have
known
a
long
time
in
a
spanish
with
muleteers
and
peasant
women
of
andalusia
one
day
as
he
finds
himself
in
a
pensive
mood
dreaming
of
a
woman
he
translates
for
her
some
lines
of
sophocles
into
verse
english
verse
you
understand
for
i
abhor
french
verse
the
carefulness
with
which
he
avoids
received
opinions
shows
a
certain
consciousness
of
those
opinions
which
in
a
more
imaginatively
independent
mind
would
scarcely
have
found
a
place
it
is
not
only
for
an
effect
but
more
and
more
genuinely
that
he
sets
his
acquirements
as
a
scholar
above
his
accomplishments
as
an
artist
clearing
away
as
it
seemed
to
him
every
illusion
from
before
his
eyes
he
forgot
the
last
illusion
of
positive
people
the
possibility
that
one
eyes
may
be
mérimée
realises
a
type
which
we
are
accustomed
to
associate
almost
exclusively
with
the
eighteenth
century
but
of
which
our
own
time
can
offer
us
many
obscure
examples
it
is
the
type
of
the
fort
the
learned
man
the
choice
narrow
artist
who
is
at
the
same
time
the
cultivated
sensualist
to
such
a
man
the
pursuit
of
women
is
part
of
his
constant
pursuit
of
human
experience
and
of
the
document
which
is
the
summing
up
of
human
experience
to
mérimée
history
itself
was
a
matter
of
detail
in
history
i
care
only
for
anecdotes
he
says
in
the
preface
to
the
du
règne
de
charles
and
he
adds
it
is
not
a
very
noble
taste
but
i
confess
to
my
shame
i
would
willingly
give
thucydides
for
the
authentic
memoirs
of
aspasia
or
of
a
slave
of
pericles
for
only
memoirs
which
are
the
familiar
talk
of
an
author
with
his
reader
afford
those
portraits
of
which
amuse
and
interest
me
this
curiosity
of
mankind
above
all
things
and
of
mankind
at
home
or
in
private
actions
not
necessarily
of
any
import
to
the
general
course
of
the
world
leads
the
curious
searcher
naturally
to
the
more
privately
interesting
and
the
less
publicly
important
half
of
mankind
not
scrupulous
in
arriving
at
any
end
by
the
most
adaptable
means
not
disturbed
by
any
illusions
as
to
the
physical
facts
of
the
universe
a
sincere
and
grateful
lover
of
variety
doubtless
an
amusing
companion
with
those
who
amused
him
mérimée
found
much
of
his
entertainments
and
instruction
at
all
events
in
his
younger
years
in
that
half
world
which
he
tells
us
he
frequented
very
much
out
of
curiosity
living
in
it
always
as
in
a
foreign
country
here
as
elsewhere
mérimée
played
the
part
of
the
amateur
he
liked
anecdotes
not
great
events
in
his
history
and
he
was
careful
to
avoid
any
too
serious
passions
in
his
search
for
sensations
there
no
doubt
for
the
sensualist
is
happiness
if
he
can
resign
himself
to
it
it
is
only
serious
passions
which
make
anybody
unhappy
and
mérimée
was
carefully
on
the
lookout
against
a
possible
unhappiness
i
can
imagine
him
ending
every
day
with
satisfaction
and
beginning
every
fresh
day
with
just
enough
expectancy
to
be
agreeable
at
that
period
of
his
life
when
he
was
writing
the
finest
of
his
stories
and
dividing
the
rest
of
his
leisure
between
the
and
the
pursuit
of
uneventful
adventures
only
though
we
are
autant
as
pascal
tells
us
it
is
useless
to
expect
that
what
is
automatic
in
us
should
remain
invariable
and
unconditioned
if
life
could
be
lived
on
a
plan
and
for
such
men
on
such
a
plan
if
first
impulses
and
profound
passions
could
be
kept
entirely
out
of
one
own
experience
and
studied
only
at
a
safe
distance
then
no
doubt
one
could
go
on
being
happy
in
a
not
too
heroic
way
but
with
mérimée
as
with
all
the
rest
of
the
world
the
scheme
breaks
down
one
day
just
when
a
reasonable
solution
to
things
seems
to
have
been
arrived
at
mérimée
had
already
entered
on
a
peaceable
enough
when
the
first
letter
came
to
him
from
the
to
whom
he
was
to
write
so
many
letters
for
nine
years
without
seeing
her
and
then
for
thirty
years
more
after
he
had
met
her
the
last
letter
being
written
but
two
hours
before
his
death
these
letters
which
we
can
now
read
in
two
volumes
have
a
delicately
insincere
sincerity
which
makes
every
letter
a
work
of
art
not
because
he
tried
to
make
it
so
but
because
he
could
not
help
seeing
the
form
simultaneously
with
the
feeling
and
writing
genuine
with
an
excellence
almost
as
impersonal
as
that
of
his
stories
he
begins
with
curiosity
which
passes
with
singular
rapidity
into
a
kind
of
passion
already
in
the
eighth
letter
long
before
he
has
seen
her
he
is
speculating
which
of
the
two
will
know
best
how
to
torture
the
other
that
is
as
he
views
it
love
best
we
shall
never
love
one
another
really
he
tells
her
as
he
begins
to
hope
for
the
contrary
then
he
discovers
for
the
first
time
and
without
practical
result
that
it
is
better
to
have
illusions
than
to
have
none
at
all
he
confesses
himself
to
her
sometimes
reminding
her
you
will
never
know
either
all
the
good
or
all
the
evil
that
i
have
in
me
i
have
spent
my
life
in
being
praised
for
qualities
which
i
do
not
possess
and
calumniated
for
defects
which
are
not
mine
and
with
a
strange
weary
humility
which
is
the
other
side
of
his
contempt
for
most
things
and
people
he
admits
to
you
i
am
like
an
old
opera
which
you
are
obliged
to
forget
in
order
to
see
it
again
with
any
pleasure
he
who
has
always
distrusted
first
impulses
finds
himself
telling
her
was
she
really
so
like
him
or
was
he
arguing
with
himself
you
always
fear
first
impulses
do
not
you
see
that
they
are
the
only
ones
which
are
worth
anything
and
which
always
succeed
does
he
realise
unable
to
change
the
temperament
which
he
has
partly
made
for
himself
that
just
there
has
been
his
own
failure
perhaps
of
all
these
of
mérimée
show
us
love
triumphing
over
the
most
carefully
guarded
personality
here
the
obstacle
is
not
duty
nor
circumstance
nor
a
rival
but
on
her
side
as
on
his
it
would
seem
a
carefully
trained
natural
coldness
in
which
action
and
even
for
the
most
part
feeling
are
relinquished
to
the
control
of
second
thoughts
a
habit
of
repressive
irony
goes
deep
mérimée
might
well
have
thought
himself
secure
against
the
outbreak
of
an
unconditional
passion
yet
here
we
find
passion
betraying
itself
often
only
by
bitterness
together
with
a
shy
surprising
tenderness
in
this
curious
lovers
itinerary
marked
out
with
all
the
customary
and
leading
for
all
its
wilful
deviations
along
the
inevitable
road
it
is
commonly
supposed
that
the
artist
by
the
habit
of
his
profession
has
made
for
himself
a
sort
of
cuirass
of
phrases
against
the
direct
attack
of
emotion
and
so
will
suffer
less
than
most
people
if
he
should
fall
into
love
and
things
should
not
go
altogether
well
with
him
rather
he
is
the
more
laid
open
to
attack
the
more
helplessly
entangled
when
once
the
net
has
been
cast
over
him
he
lives
through
every
passionate
trouble
not
merely
with
the
daily
emotions
of
the
crowd
but
with
the
whole
of
his
imagination
pain
is
multiplied
to
him
by
the
force
of
that
faculty
by
which
he
conceives
delight
what
is
most
torturing
in
every
not
quite
fortunate
love
is
memory
and
the
artist
becomes
an
artist
by
his
intensification
of
memory
mérimée
has
himself
defined
art
as
exaggeration
well
to
the
artist
his
own
life
is
an
exaggeration
not
propos
and
every
hour
dramatises
for
him
its
own
pain
and
pleasure
in
a
tragic
comedy
of
which
he
is
the
author
and
actor
and
spectator
the
practice
of
art
is
a
sharpening
of
the
sensations
and
the
knife
once
sharpened
does
it
cut
into
one
hand
less
deeply
because
one
is
in
the
act
of
using
it
to
carve
wood
and
so
we
find
mérimée
the
most
impersonal
of
artists
and
one
of
those
most
critical
of
the
caprices
and
violences
of
fate
giving
in
to
an
almost
obvious
temptation
an
anonymous
correspondence
a
mysterious
unknown
woman
and
passing
from
stage
to
stage
of
a
finally
very
genuine
which
kept
him
in
a
fluttering
agitation
for
more
than
thirty
years
it
is
curious
to
note
that
the
little
which
we
know
of
this
seems
to
mark
her
out
as
the
realisation
of
a
type
which
had
always
been
mérimée
type
of
woman
she
has
the
wicked
eyes
of
all
his
heroines
from
the
mariquita
of
his
first
attempt
in
literature
who
haunts
the
inquisitor
with
her
great
black
eyes
like
the
eyes
of
a
young
cat
soft
and
wicked
at
once
he
finds
her
at
the
end
of
his
life
in
a
novel
of
tourguenieff
one
of
those
diabolical
creatures
whose
coquetry
is
the
more
dangerous
because
it
is
capable
of
passion
like
so
many
artists
he
has
invented
his
ideal
before
he
meets
it
and
must
have
seemed
almost
to
have
fallen
in
love
with
his
own
creation
it
is
one
of
the
privileges
of
art
to
create
nature
as
according
to
a
certain
mystical
doctrine
you
can
actualise
by
sheer
fixity
of
contemplation
your
mental
image
of
a
thing
into
the
thing
itself
the
was
one
of
a
series
the
rest
imaginary
and
her
power
over
mérimée
we
can
hardly
doubt
came
not
only
from
her
queer
likeness
of
temperament
to
his
but
from
the
singular
flattering
pleasure
which
it
must
have
given
him
to
find
that
he
had
invented
with
so
much
truth
to
nature
mérimée
as
a
writer
belongs
to
the
race
of
laclos
and
of
stendhal
a
race
essentially
french
and
we
find
him
representing
a
little
coldly
as
it
seemed
the
claims
of
mere
unimpassioned
intellect
at
work
on
passionate
problems
among
those
people
of
the
romantic
period
to
whom
emotion
evident
emotion
was
everything
in
his
subjects
he
is
as
romantic
as
victor
hugo
or
gautier
he
adds
even
a
peculiar
flavour
of
cruelty
to
the
romantic
ingredients
but
he
distinguishes
sharply
as
french
writers
before
him
had
so
well
known
how
to
do
between
the
passion
one
is
recounting
and
the
moved
or
unmoved
way
in
which
one
chooses
to
tell
it
to
mérimée
art
was
a
very
formal
thing
almost
a
part
of
learning
it
was
a
thing
to
be
done
with
a
clear
head
reflectively
with
a
calm
mastery
of
even
the
most
vivid
material
while
others
at
that
time
were
intoxicating
themselves
with
strange
sensations
hoping
that
nature
would
take
the
pen
out
of
their
hands
and
write
just
at
the
moment
when
their
own
thoughts
became
least
coherent
mérimée
went
quietly
to
work
over
something
a
little
abnormal
which
he
had
found
in
nature
with
as
disinterested
as
scholarly
as
mentally
reserved
an
interest
as
if
it
were
one
of
those
gothic
monuments
which
he
inspected
to
such
good
purpose
and
as
it
has
seemed
to
his
biographer
with
so
little
sympathy
his
own
emotion
so
far
as
it
is
roused
seems
to
him
an
extraneous
thing
a
thing
to
be
concealed
if
not
a
little
ashamed
of
it
is
the
thing
itself
he
wishes
to
give
you
not
his
feelings
about
it
and
his
theory
is
that
if
the
thing
itself
can
only
be
made
to
stand
and
speak
before
the
reader
the
reader
will
supply
for
himself
all
the
feeling
that
is
needed
all
the
feeling
that
would
be
called
out
in
nature
by
a
perfectly
clear
sight
of
just
such
passions
in
action
it
seems
to
him
bad
art
to
paint
the
picture
and
to
write
a
description
of
the
picture
as
well
and
his
method
serves
him
wonderfully
up
to
a
certain
point
and
then
leaves
him
without
his
being
well
aware
of
it
at
the
moment
even
when
he
has
convinced
himself
that
he
has
realised
the
utmost
of
his
aim
at
a
time
when
he
had
come
to
consider
scholarly
dexterity
as
the
most
important
part
of
art
mérimée
tells
us
that
vénus
seemed
to
him
the
best
story
he
had
ever
written
he
has
often
been
taken
at
his
word
but
to
take
him
at
his
word
is
to
do
him
an
injustice
vénus
is
a
modern
setting
of
the
old
story
of
the
ring
given
to
venus
and
mérimée
has
been
praised
for
the
ingenuity
with
which
he
has
obtained
an
effect
of
supernatural
terror
while
leaving
the
way
open
for
a
material
explanation
of
the
supernatural
what
he
has
really
done
is
to
materialise
a
myth
by
accepting
in
it
precisely
what
might
be
a
mere
superstition
the
form
of
the
thing
and
leaving
out
the
spiritual
meaning
of
which
that
form
was
no
more
than
a
temporary
expression
the
ring
which
the
bridegroom
sets
on
the
finger
of
venus
and
which
the
statue
finger
closes
upon
accepting
it
symbolises
the
pact
between
love
and
sensuality
the
lover
abdication
of
all
but
the
physical
part
of
love
and
the
statue
taking
its
place
between
husband
and
wife
on
the
and
crushing
life
out
of
him
in
an
inexorable
embrace
symbolises
the
merely
natural
destruction
which
that
granted
prayer
brings
with
it
as
a
merely
human
messalina
takes
her
lover
on
his
own
terms
in
his
abandonment
of
all
to
venus
mérimée
sees
a
cruel
and
fantastic
superstition
which
he
is
afraid
of
seeming
to
take
too
seriously
which
he
prefers
to
leave
as
a
story
of
ghosts
or
bogies
a
thing
at
which
we
are
to
shiver
as
at
a
mere
twitch
on
the
nerves
while
our
mental
confidence
in
the
impossibility
of
what
we
can
not
explain
is
preserved
for
us
by
a
hint
at
a
muleteer
vengeance
have
i
frightened
you
says
the
man
of
the
world
with
a
reassuring
smile
think
about
it
no
more
i
really
meant
nothing
and
yet
does
he
after
all
mean
nothing
the
devil
the
old
pagan
gods
the
spirits
of
evil
incarnated
under
every
form
fascinated
him
it
gave
him
a
malign
pleasure
to
set
them
at
their
evil
work
among
men
while
all
the
time
he
mocks
them
and
the
men
who
believed
in
them
he
is
a
materialist
and
yet
he
believes
in
at
least
a
something
evil
outside
the
world
or
in
the
heart
of
it
which
sets
humanity
at
its
strange
games
relentlessly
even
then
he
will
not
surrender
his
doubts
his
ironies
his
negations
is
he
perhaps
at
times
the
atheist
who
fears
that
after
all
god
may
exist
or
at
least
who
realises
how
much
he
would
fear
him
if
he
did
exist
mérimée
had
always
delighted
in
mystifications
he
was
always
on
his
guard
against
being
mystified
himself
either
by
nature
or
by
his
in
the
early
romantic
days
he
had
had
a
genuine
passion
for
various
things
local
colour
for
instance
but
even
then
he
had
invented
it
by
a
kind
of
trick
and
later
on
he
explains
what
a
poor
thing
local
colour
is
since
it
can
so
easily
be
invented
without
leaving
one
study
he
is
full
of
curiosity
and
will
go
far
to
satisfy
it
regretting
the
decadence
in
our
times
of
energetic
passions
in
favour
of
tranquillity
and
perhaps
of
happiness
these
energetic
passions
he
will
find
indeed
in
our
own
times
in
corsica
in
spain
in
lithuania
really
in
the
midst
of
a
very
genuine
and
profoundly
studied
local
colour
and
also
under
many
disguises
in
parisian
mérimée
prized
happiness
material
comfort
the
satisfaction
of
one
immediate
desires
very
highly
and
it
was
his
keen
sense
of
life
of
the
pleasures
of
living
that
gave
him
some
of
his
keenness
in
the
realisation
of
violent
death
physical
pain
whatever
disturbs
the
equilibrium
of
things
with
unusual
emphasis
himself
really
selfish
he
can
distinguish
the
unhappiness
of
others
with
a
kind
of
intuition
which
is
not
sympathy
but
which
selfish
people
often
have
a
dramatic
consciousness
of
how
painful
pain
must
be
whoever
feels
it
it
is
not
pity
though
it
communicates
itself
to
us
often
enough
as
pity
it
is
the
sensitiveness
of
a
man
who
watches
human
things
closely
bringing
them
home
to
himself
with
the
deliberate
essaying
art
of
an
actor
who
has
to
represent
a
particular
passion
in
movement
and
always
in
mérimée
there
is
this
union
of
curiosity
with
indifference
the
curiosity
of
the
student
the
indifference
of
the
man
of
the
world
indifference
in
him
as
in
the
man
of
the
world
is
partly
an
attitude
adopted
for
its
form
and
influencing
the
temperament
just
so
much
as
gesture
always
influences
emotion
the
man
who
forces
himself
to
appear
calm
under
excitement
teaches
his
nerves
to
follow
instinctively
the
way
he
has
shown
them
in
time
he
will
not
merely
seem
calm
but
will
be
calm
at
the
moment
when
he
learns
that
a
great
disaster
has
befallen
him
but
in
mérimée
was
the
indifference
even
as
external
as
it
must
always
be
when
there
is
restraint
when
therefore
there
is
something
to
restrain
was
there
not
in
him
a
certain
drying
up
of
the
sources
of
emotion
as
the
man
of
the
world
came
to
accept
almost
the
point
of
view
of
society
reading
his
stories
to
a
little
circle
of
court
ladies
when
once
in
a
while
he
permitted
himself
to
write
a
story
and
was
not
this
increase
of
indifference
now
more
than
ever
characteristic
almost
the
man
himself
the
chief
reason
why
he
abandoned
art
so
early
writing
only
two
or
three
short
stories
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
and
writing
these
with
a
labour
which
by
no
means
conceals
itself
mérimée
had
an
abstract
interest
in
almost
an
enthusiasm
for
facts
facts
for
their
meaning
the
light
they
throw
on
psychology
he
declines
to
consider
psychology
except
through
its
expression
in
facts
with
an
impersonality
far
more
real
than
that
of
flaubert
the
document
historical
or
social
must
translate
itself
into
sharp
action
before
he
can
use
it
not
that
he
does
not
see
and
appreciate
better
than
most
others
all
there
is
of
significance
in
the
document
itself
but
his
theory
of
art
is
inexorable
he
never
allowed
himself
to
write
as
he
pleased
but
he
wrote
always
as
he
considered
the
artist
should
write
thus
he
made
for
himself
a
kind
of
formula
confining
himself
as
some
thought
within
too
narrow
limits
but
to
himself
doing
exactly
what
he
set
himself
to
do
with
all
the
satisfaction
of
one
who
is
convinced
of
the
justice
of
his
aim
and
confident
of
his
power
to
attain
it
look
for
instance
at
his
longest
far
from
his
best
work
chronique
du
règne
de
charles
like
so
much
of
his
work
it
has
something
of
the
air
of
a
de
force
not
taken
up
entirely
for
its
own
sake
mérimée
drops
into
a
fashion
half
deprecatingly
as
if
he
sees
through
it
and
yet
as
with
merely
mundane
elegance
with
a
resolve
to
be
more
scrupuously
exact
than
its
devotees
belief
says
some
one
in
this
book
as
if
speaking
for
mérimée
is
a
precious
gift
which
has
been
denied
me
well
he
will
do
better
without
belief
than
those
who
believe
written
under
a
title
which
suggests
a
work
of
actual
history
it
is
more
than
possible
that
the
first
suggestion
of
this
book
really
came
as
he
tells
us
in
the
preface
from
the
reading
of
a
large
number
of
memoirs
and
pamphlets
relating
to
the
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
i
wished
to
make
an
epitome
of
my
reading
he
tells
us
and
here
is
the
epitome
the
historical
problem
attracted
him
that
never
quite
explicable
massacre
of
bartholomew
in
which
there
was
precisely
the
violence
of
action
and
uncertainty
of
motive
which
he
liked
to
set
before
him
at
the
beginning
of
a
task
in
literature
probable
clearly
defined
people
in
the
dress
of
the
period
grew
up
naturally
about
this
central
motive
humour
and
irony
have
their
part
there
are
adventures
told
with
a
point
of
sharpness
and
in
the
fewest
possible
words
there
is
one
of
his
cruel
and
loving
women
in
whom
every
sentiment
becomes
action
by
some
twisted
feminine
logic
of
their
own
it
is
the
most
artistic
the
most
of
historical
novels
and
yet
this
perfect
neatness
of
method
suggests
a
certain
indifference
on
the
part
of
the
writer
as
if
he
were
more
interested
in
doing
the
thing
well
than
in
doing
it
and
that
in
all
but
the
very
best
of
his
stories
even
perhaps
in
only
not
in
such
perfect
things
as
as
falcone
is
what
mérimée
just
lets
us
see
underneath
an
almost
faultless
skill
of
narrative
an
incident
told
by
mérimée
at
his
best
gathers
about
it
something
of
the
gravity
of
history
the
composed
way
in
which
it
is
told
helping
to
give
it
the
equivalent
of
remoteness
allowing
it
not
merely
to
be
but
what
is
more
difficult
to
seem
classic
in
its
own
time
magnificent
things
things
after
my
own
heart
that
is
to
say
greek
in
their
truth
and
simplicity
he
writes
in
a
letter
referring
to
the
tales
of
poushkin
the
phrase
is
scarcely
too
strong
to
apply
to
what
is
best
in
his
own
work
made
out
of
elemental
passions
hard
cruel
detached
as
it
were
from
their
own
sentiments
the
stories
that
he
tells
might
in
other
hands
become
melodramas
taken
thoughtlessly
out
of
his
hands
has
supplied
the
libretto
to
the
most
popular
of
modern
light
operas
and
yet
in
his
severe
method
of
telling
mere
outlines
it
seems
told
with
an
even
stricter
watch
over
what
is
significantly
left
out
than
over
what
is
briefly
allowed
to
be
said
in
words
these
stories
sum
up
little
separate
pieces
of
the
world
each
a
little
world
in
itself
and
each
is
a
little
world
which
he
has
made
his
own
with
a
labor
at
last
its
own
reward
and
taking
life
partly
because
he
has
put
into
it
more
of
himself
than
the
mere
intention
of
doing
it
well
mérimée
loved
spain
and
which
by
some
caprice
of
popularity
is
the
symbol
of
spain
to
people
in
general
is
really
to
those
who
know
spain
well
the
most
spanish
thing
that
has
been
written
since
all
the
little
parade
of
local
colour
and
philology
the
appendix
on
the
of
the
gipsies
done
to
heighten
the
illusion
has
more
significance
than
people
sometimes
think
in
this
story
all
the
qualities
of
mérimée
come
into
agreement
the
student
of
human
passions
the
traveller
the
observer
the
learned
man
meet
in
harmony
and
in
addition
there
is
the
the
true
in
love
with
spain
and
the
spaniards
it
is
significant
that
at
the
reception
of
mérimée
at
the
académie
française
in
etienne
thought
it
already
needful
to
say
do
not
pause
in
the
midst
of
your
career
rest
is
not
permitted
to
your
talent
already
mérimée
was
giving
way
to
facts
to
facts
in
themselves
as
they
come
into
history
into
records
of
scholarship
we
find
him
writing
a
little
dryly
on
catiline
on
cæsar
on
don
pedro
the
cruel
learning
russian
and
translating
from
it
yet
while
studying
the
russians
before
all
the
world
never
discovering
the
mystical
russian
soul
writing
learned
articles
writing
reports
he
looked
around
on
contemporary
literature
and
found
nothing
that
he
could
care
for
stendhal
was
gone
and
who
else
was
there
to
admire
flaubert
it
seemed
to
him
was
wasting
his
talent
under
the
pretence
of
realism
victor
hugo
was
a
fellow
with
the
most
beautiful
figures
of
speech
at
his
disposal
who
did
not
take
the
trouble
to
think
but
intoxicated
himself
with
his
own
words
baudelaire
made
him
furious
renan
filled
him
with
pitying
scorn
in
the
midst
of
his
contempt
he
may
perhaps
have
imagined
that
he
was
being
left
behind
for
whatever
reason
weakness
or
strength
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
it
was
worth
while
to
strive
for
anything
any
more
he
died
probably
at
the
moment
when
he
was
no
longer
a
fashion
and
had
not
yet
become
a
classic
gérard
de
nerval
this
is
the
problem
of
one
who
lost
the
whole
world
and
gained
his
own
soul
i
like
to
arrange
my
life
as
if
it
were
a
novel
wrote
gérard
de
nerval
and
indeed
it
is
somewhat
difficult
to
disentangle
the
precise
facts
of
an
existence
which
was
never
quite
conscious
where
began
and
where
ended
that
overflowing
of
dreams
into
real
life
of
which
he
speaks
i
do
not
ask
of
god
he
said
that
he
should
change
anything
in
events
themselves
but
that
he
should
change
me
in
regard
to
things
so
that
i
might
have
the
power
to
create
my
own
universe
about
me
to
govern
my
dreams
instead
of
enduring
them
the
prayer
was
not
granted
in
its
entirety
and
the
tragedy
of
his
life
lay
in
the
vain
endeavour
to
hold
back
the
irresistible
empire
of
the
unseen
which
it
was
the
joy
of
his
life
to
summon
about
him
briefly
we
know
that
gérard
labrunie
the
name
de
nerval
was
taken
from
a
little
piece
of
property
worth
some
francs
which
he
liked
to
imagine
had
always
been
in
the
possession
of
his
family
was
born
at
paris
may
his
father
was
his
mother
died
before
he
was
old
enough
to
remember
her
following
the
on
the
russian
campaign
and
gérard
was
brought
up
largely
under
the
care
of
a
studious
and
erratic
uncle
in
a
little
village
called
montagny
near
ermenonville
he
was
a
precocious
schoolboy
and
by
the
age
of
eighteen
had
published
six
little
collections
of
verses
it
was
during
one
of
his
holidays
that
he
saw
for
the
first
and
last
time
the
young
girl
whom
he
calls
adrienne
and
whom
under
many
names
he
loved
to
the
end
of
his
life
one
evening
she
had
come
from
the
château
to
dance
with
the
young
peasant
girls
on
the
grass
she
had
danced
with
gérard
he
had
kissed
her
cheek
he
had
crowned
her
hair
with
laurels
he
had
heard
her
sing
an
old
song
telling
of
the
sorrows
of
a
princess
whom
her
father
had
shut
in
a
tower
because
she
had
loved
to
gérard
it
seemed
that
already
he
remembered
her
and
certainly
he
was
never
to
forget
her
he
heard
that
adrienne
had
taken
the
veil
then
that
she
was
dead
to
one
who
had
realised
that
it
is
we
the
living
who
walk
in
a
world
of
phantoms
death
could
not
exclude
hope
and
when
many
years
later
he
fell
seriously
and
fantastically
in
love
with
a
little
actress
called
jenny
colon
it
was
because
he
seemed
to
have
found
in
that
blonde
and
very
human
person
the
of
the
blonde
adrienne
meanwhile
gérard
was
living
in
paris
among
his
friends
the
romantics
writing
and
living
in
an
equally
desultory
fashion
bon
was
the
best
loved
and
in
his
time
not
the
least
famous
of
the
company
he
led
by
choice
now
in
paris
now
across
europe
the
life
of
a
vagabond
and
more
persistently
than
others
of
his
friends
who
were
driven
to
it
by
need
at
that
time
when
it
was
the
aim
of
every
one
to
be
as
eccentric
as
possible
the
eccentricities
of
gérard
life
and
thought
seemed
on
the
whole
less
noticeable
than
those
of
many
really
quite
normal
persons
but
with
gérard
there
was
no
pose
and
when
one
day
he
was
found
in
the
leading
a
lobster
at
the
end
of
a
blue
ribbon
because
he
said
it
does
not
bark
and
knows
the
secrets
of
the
sea
the
visionary
had
simply
lost
control
of
his
visions
and
had
to
be
sent
to
blanche
asylum
at
montmartre
he
entered
march
and
came
out
apparently
well
again
on
the
of
november
it
would
seem
that
this
first
access
of
madness
was
to
some
extent
the
consequence
of
the
final
rupture
with
jenny
colon
on
june
she
died
and
it
was
partly
in
order
to
put
as
many
leagues
of
the
earth
as
possible
between
him
and
that
memory
that
gérard
set
out
at
the
end
of
for
the
east
it
was
also
in
order
to
prove
to
the
world
by
his
consciousness
of
external
things
that
he
had
recovered
his
reason
while
he
was
in
syria
he
once
more
fell
in
love
with
a
new
incarnation
of
adrienne
a
young
druse
saléma
the
daughter
of
a
sheikh
of
lebanon
and
it
seems
to
have
been
almost
by
accident
that
he
did
not
marry
her
he
returned
to
paris
at
the
end
of
or
the
beginning
of
and
for
the
next
few
years
he
lived
mostly
in
paris
writing
charming
graceful
remarkably
sane
articles
and
books
and
wandering
about
the
streets
by
day
and
night
in
a
perpetual
dream
from
which
now
and
again
he
was
somewhat
rudely
awakened
when
in
the
spring
of
he
went
to
see
heine
for
whom
he
was
doing
an
admirable
prose
translation
of
his
poems
and
told
him
he
had
come
to
return
the
money
he
had
received
in
advance
because
the
times
were
accomplished
and
the
end
of
the
world
announced
by
the
apocalypse
was
at
hand
heine
sent
for
a
cab
and
gérard
found
himself
at
dubois
asylum
where
he
remained
two
months
it
was
on
coming
out
of
the
asylum
that
he
wrote
a
delightful
idyl
chiefly
autobiographical
one
of
his
three
actual
achievements
on
august
he
had
to
be
taken
to
blanche
asylum
at
passy
where
he
remained
till
may
thither
after
a
month
or
two
spent
in
germany
he
returned
on
august
and
on
october
he
came
out
for
the
last
time
manifestly
uncured
he
was
now
engaged
on
the
narrative
of
his
own
madness
and
the
first
part
of
rêve
et
la
appeared
in
the
de
of
january
i
on
the
he
came
into
the
office
of
the
review
and
showed
gautier
and
maxime
du
camp
an
which
he
was
carrying
in
his
pocket
it
is
the
girdle
he
said
that
madame
de
maintenon
wore
when
she
had
performed
at
on
the
he
wrote
to
a
friend
come
and
prove
my
identity
at
the
of
the
châtelet
the
night
before
he
had
been
working
at
his
manuscript
in
a
of
les
halles
and
had
been
arrested
as
a
vagabond
he
was
used
to
such
little
misadventures
but
he
complained
of
the
difficulty
of
writing
i
set
off
after
an
idea
he
said
and
lose
myself
i
am
hours
in
finding
my
way
back
do
you
know
i
can
scarcely
write
twenty
lines
a
day
the
darkness
comes
about
me
so
close
he
took
out
the
it
is
the
garter
of
the
queen
of
sheba
he
said
the
snow
was
freezing
on
the
ground
and
on
the
night
of
the
at
three
in
the
morning
the
landlord
of
a
penny
doss
in
the
rue
de
la
a
filthy
alley
lying
between
the
quays
and
the
rue
de
rivoli
heard
some
one
knocking
at
the
door
but
did
not
open
on
account
of
the
cold
at
dawn
the
body
of
gérard
de
nerval
was
found
hanging
by
the
to
a
bar
of
the
window
it
is
not
necessary
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
volumes
which
make
up
the
works
of
gérard
de
nerval
he
was
not
a
great
writer
he
had
moments
of
greatness
and
it
is
the
particular
quality
of
these
moments
which
is
of
interest
for
us
there
is
the
entertaining
but
not
more
than
entertaining
en
orient
there
is
the
estimable
translation
of
and
the
admirable
versions
from
heine
there
are
the
volumes
of
short
stories
and
sketches
of
which
even
illuminés
in
spite
of
the
promise
of
its
title
is
little
more
than
an
agreeable
compilation
but
there
remain
three
compositions
the
sonnets
rêve
et
la
vie
and
of
which
is
the
most
objectively
achieved
a
wandering
idyl
full
of
pastoral
delight
and
containing
some
of
valois
two
of
which
have
been
translated
by
rossetti
rêve
et
la
being
the
most
intensely
personal
a
narrative
of
madness
unique
as
madness
itself
and
the
sonnets
a
kind
of
miracle
which
may
be
held
to
have
created
something
at
least
of
the
method
of
the
later
symbolist
these
three
compositions
in
which
alone
gérard
is
his
finest
self
all
belong
to
the
periods
when
he
was
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
actually
mad
the
sonnets
belong
to
two
of
these
periods
rêve
et
la
to
the
last
was
written
in
the
short
interval
between
the
two
attacks
in
the
early
part
of
we
have
thus
the
case
of
a
writer
graceful
and
elegant
when
he
is
sane
but
only
inspired
only
really
wise
passionate
collected
only
really
master
of
himself
when
he
is
insane
it
may
be
worth
looking
at
a
few
of
the
points
which
so
suggestive
a
problem
presents
to
us
gérard
de
nerval
lived
the
transfigured
inner
life
of
the
dreamer
i
was
very
tired
of
life
he
says
and
like
so
many
dreamers
who
have
all
the
luminous
darkness
of
the
universe
in
their
brains
he
found
his
most
precious
and
uninterrupted
solitude
in
the
crowded
and
more
sordid
streets
of
great
cities
he
who
had
loved
the
queen
of
sheba
and
seen
the
seven
elohims
dividing
the
world
could
find
nothing
more
tolerable
in
mortal
conditions
when
he
was
truly
aware
of
them
than
the
company
of
the
meanest
of
mankind
in
whom
poverty
and
vice
and
the
hard
pressure
of
civilisation
still
leave
some
of
the
original
vivacity
of
the
human
comedy
the
real
world
seeming
to
be
always
so
far
from
him
and
a
sort
of
terror
of
the
gulfs
holding
him
in
spite
of
himself
to
its
flying
skirts
he
found
something
at
all
events
realisable
concrete
in
these
drinkers
of
les
halles
these
vagabonds
of
the
place
du
carrousel
among
whom
he
so
often
sought
refuge
it
was
literally
in
part
a
refuge
during
the
day
he
could
sleep
but
night
wakened
him
and
that
restlessness
which
the
night
draws
out
in
those
who
are
really
under
lunar
influences
set
his
feet
wandering
if
only
in
order
that
his
mind
might
wander
the
less
the
sun
as
he
mentions
never
appears
in
dreams
but
with
the
approach
of
night
is
not
every
one
a
little
readier
to
believe
in
the
mystery
lurking
behind
the
world
crains
dans
le
mur
aveugle
un
regard
qui
he
writes
in
one
of
his
great
sonnets
and
that
fear
of
the
invisible
watchfulness
of
nature
was
never
absent
from
him
it
is
one
of
the
terrors
of
human
existence
that
we
may
be
led
at
once
to
seek
and
so
shun
solitude
unable
to
bear
the
mortal
pressure
if
its
embrace
unable
to
endure
the
nostalgia
of
its
absence
i
think
man
happiest
when
he
forgets
himself
says
an
elizabethan
dramatist
and
with
gérard
there
was
adrienne
to
forget
and
jenny
colon
the
actress
and
the
queen
of
sheba
but
to
have
drunk
of
the
cup
of
dreams
is
to
have
drunk
of
the
cup
of
eternal
memory
the
past
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
the
future
were
continually
with
him
only
the
present
fled
continually
from
under
his
feet
it
was
only
by
the
effort
of
this
contact
with
people
who
lived
so
sincerely
in
the
day
the
minute
that
he
could
find
even
a
temporary
foothold
with
them
at
least
he
could
hold
back
all
the
stars
and
the
darkness
beyond
them
and
the
interminable
approach
and
disappearance
of
all
the
ages
if
only
for
the
space
between
tavern
and
tavern
where
he
could
open
his
eyes
on
so
frank
an
abandonment
to
the
common
drunkenness
of
most
people
in
this
world
here
for
once
really
living
the
symbolic
intoxication
of
their
ignorance
like
so
many
dreamers
of
illimitable
dreams
it
was
the
fate
of
gérard
to
incarnate
his
ideal
in
the
person
of
an
actress
the
fatal
transfiguration
of
the
footlights
in
which
reality
and
the
artificial
change
places
with
so
fantastic
a
regularity
has
drawn
many
moths
into
its
flame
and
will
draw
more
as
long
as
men
persist
in
demanding
illusion
of
what
is
real
and
reality
in
what
is
illusion
the
jenny
colons
of
the
world
are
very
simple
very
real
if
one
will
but
refrain
from
assuming
them
to
be
a
mystery
but
it
is
the
penalty
of
all
imaginative
lovers
to
create
for
themselves
the
veil
which
hides
from
them
the
features
of
the
beloved
it
is
their
privilege
for
it
is
incomparably
more
entrancing
to
fancy
oneself
in
love
with
isis
than
to
know
that
one
is
in
love
with
manon
lescaut
the
picture
of
gérard
after
many
hesitations
revealing
to
the
astonished
jenny
that
she
is
the
incarnation
of
another
the
shadow
of
a
dream
that
she
has
been
adrienne
and
is
about
to
be
the
queen
of
sheba
her
very
human
little
cry
of
pure
incomprehension
vous
ne
pas
and
her
prompt
refuge
in
the
arms
of
the
premier
ridé
if
it
were
not
of
the
acutest
pathos
would
certainly
be
of
the
most
quintessential
comedy
for
gérard
so
sharp
an
awakening
was
but
like
the
passage
from
one
state
to
another
across
that
little
bridge
of
one
step
which
lies
between
heaven
and
hell
to
which
he
was
so
used
in
his
dreams
it
gave
permanency
to
the
trivial
crystallising
it
in
another
than
sense
and
when
death
came
changing
mere
human
memory
into
the
terms
of
eternity
the
darkness
of
the
spiritual
world
was
lit
with
a
new
star
which
was
henceforth
the
wandering
desolate
guide
of
so
many
visions
the
tragic
figure
of
aurélia
which
comes
and
goes
through
all
the
labyrinths
of
dream
is
now
seen
always
as
if
lit
up
by
a
pale
and
dying
hurried
away
by
dark
horsemen
the
dream
or
doctrine
of
the
of
souls
which
has
given
so
much
consolation
to
so
many
questioners
of
eternity
was
for
gérard
need
we
doubt
a
dream
rather
than
a
doctrine
but
one
of
those
dreams
which
are
nearer
to
a
man
than
his
breath
this
vague
and
hopeless
love
he
writes
in
inspired
by
an
actress
which
night
by
night
took
hold
of
me
at
the
hour
of
the
performance
leaving
me
only
at
the
hour
of
sleep
had
its
germ
in
the
recollection
of
adrienne
flower
of
the
night
unfolding
under
the
pale
rays
of
the
moon
rosy
and
blonde
phantom
gliding
over
the
green
grass
half
bathed
in
white
mist
to
love
a
nun
under
the
form
of
an
actress
and
if
it
were
the
very
same
it
is
enough
to
drive
one
mad
yes
y
a
de
quoi
devenir
fou
as
gérard
had
found
but
there
was
also
in
this
intimate
sense
of
the
unity
perpetuity
and
harmoniously
recurring
rhythm
of
nature
not
a
little
of
the
inner
substance
of
wisdom
it
was
a
dream
perhaps
refracted
from
some
broken
illuminating
angle
by
which
madness
catches
unseen
light
that
revealed
to
him
the
meaning
of
his
own
superstition
fatality
malady
during
my
sleep
i
had
a
marvelous
vision
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
goddess
appeared
before
me
saying
to
me
am
the
same
as
mary
the
same
as
thy
mother
the
same
also
whom
under
all
forms
thou
hast
always
loved
at
each
of
thine
ordeals
i
have
dropt
yet
one
more
of
the
masks
with
which
i
veil
my
countenance
and
soon
thou
shalt
see
me
as
i
am
and
in
perhaps
his
finest
sonnet
the
mysterious
we
have
under
other
symbols
and
with
the
deliberate
inconsequence
of
these
sonnets
the
comfort
and
despair
of
the
same
faith

who
has
not
often
meditated
above
all
what
artist
on
the
slightness
after
all
of
the
link
which
holds
our
faculties
together
in
that
sober
health
of
the
brain
which
we
call
reason
are
there
not
moments
when
that
link
seems
to
be
worn
down
to
so
fine
a
tenuity
that
the
wing
of
a
passing
dream
might
suffice
to
snap
it
the
consciousness
seems
as
it
were
to
expand
and
contract
at
once
into
something
too
wide
for
the
universe
and
too
narrow
for
the
thought
of
self
to
find
room
within
it
is
it
that
the
sense
of
identity
is
about
to
evaporate
annihilating
all
or
is
it
that
a
more
profound
identity
the
identity
of
the
whole
sentient
universe
has
been
at
last
realised
leaving
the
concrete
world
on
these
brief
voyages
the
fear
is
that
we
may
not
have
strength
to
return
or
that
we
may
lose
the
way
back
every
artist
lives
a
double
life
in
which
he
is
for
the
most
part
conscious
of
the
illusions
of
the
imagination
he
is
conscious
also
of
the
illusions
of
the
nerves
which
he
shares
with
every
man
of
imaginative
mind
nights
of
insomnia
days
of
anxious
waiting
the
sudden
shock
of
an
event
and
one
of
these
common
disturbances
may
be
enough
to
jangle
the
tuneless
bells
of
one
nerves
the
artist
can
distinguish
these
causes
of
certain
of
his
moods
from
those
other
causes
which
come
to
him
because
he
is
an
artist
and
are
properly
concerned
with
that
invention
which
is
his
own
function
yet
is
there
not
some
danger
that
he
may
come
to
confuse
one
with
the
other
that
he
may
lose
the
thread
which
conducts
him
through
the
intricacies
of
the
inner
world
the
supreme
artist
certainly
is
the
furthest
of
all
men
from
this
danger
for
he
is
the
supreme
intelligence
like
dante
he
can
pass
through
hell
unsinged
with
him
imagination
is
vision
when
he
looks
into
the
darkness
he
sees
the
vague
dreamer
the
insecure
artist
and
the
uncertain
mystic
at
once
sees
only
shadows
not
recognising
their
outlines
he
is
mastered
by
the
images
which
have
come
at
his
call
he
has
not
the
power
which
chains
them
for
his
slaves
the
kingdom
of
heaven
suffers
violence
and
the
dreamer
who
has
gone
tremblingly
into
the
darkness
is
in
peril
at
the
hands
of
those
very
real
phantoms
who
are
the
reflection
of
his
fear
the
madness
of
gérard
de
nerval
whatever
physiological
reasons
may
be
rightly
given
for
its
outbreak
subsidence
and
return
i
take
to
have
been
essentially
due
to
the
weakness
and
not
the
excess
of
his
visionary
quality
to
the
insufficiency
of
his
imaginative
energy
and
to
his
lack
of
spiritual
discipline
he
was
an
unsystematic
mystic
his
tower
of
babel
in
two
hundred
volumes
that
medley
of
books
of
religion
science
astrology
history
travel
which
he
thought
would
have
rejoiced
the
heart
of
pico
della
mirandola
of
meursius
or
of
nicholas
of
cusa
was
truly
as
he
says
enough
to
drive
a
wise
man
mad
why
not
also
he
adds
enough
to
make
a
madman
wise
but
precisely
because
it
was
this
bizarre
this
jumble
of
the
perilous
secrets
in
which
wisdom
is
so
often
folly
and
folly
so
often
wisdom
he
speaks
vaguely
of
the
cabbala
the
cabbala
would
have
been
safety
to
him
as
the
catholic
church
would
have
been
or
any
other
reasoned
scheme
of
things
wavering
among
intuitions
ignorances
shadows
of
falsehood
now
audacious
now
hesitating
he
was
blown
hither
and
thither
by
conflicting
winds
a
prey
to
the
indefinite
rêve
et
la
vie
the
last
fragments
of
which
were
found
in
his
pockets
after
his
suicide
scrawled
on
scraps
of
paper
interrupted
with
cabbalistic
signs
and
a
demonstration
of
the
immaculate
conception
by
geometry
is
a
narrative
of
a
madman
visions
by
the
madman
himself
yet
showing
as
gautier
says
cold
reason
seated
by
the
bedside
of
hot
fever
hallucination
analysing
itself
by
a
supreme
philosophic
effort
what
is
curious
yet
after
all
natural
is
that
part
of
the
narrative
seems
to
be
contemporaneous
with
what
it
describes
and
part
subsequent
to
it
so
that
it
is
not
as
when
de
quincey
says
to
us
such
or
such
was
the
that
i
had
on
such
a
night
but
as
if
the
had
begun
to
write
down
his
dream
while
he
was
yet
within
its
coils
the
descent
into
hell
he
calls
it
twice
yet
does
he
not
also
write
at
times
i
imagined
that
my
force
and
my
activity
were
doubled
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
knew
everything
understood
everything
and
imagination
brought
me
infinite
pleasures
now
that
i
have
recovered
what
men
call
reason
must
i
not
regret
having
lost
them
but
he
had
not
lost
them
he
was
still
in
that
state
of
double
consciousness
which
he
describes
in
one
of
his
visions
when
seeing
people
dressed
in
white
i
was
astonished
he
says
to
see
them
all
dressed
in
white
yet
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
an
optical
illusion
his
cosmical
visions
are
at
times
so
magnificent
that
he
seems
to
be
creating
myths
and
it
is
with
a
worthy
ingenuity
that
he
plays
the
part
he
imagines
to
be
assigned
to
him
in
his
astral
influences
first
of
all
i
imagined
that
the
persons
collected
in
the
garden
of
the
madhouse
all
had
some
influence
on
the
stars
and
that
the
one
who
always
walked
round
and
round
in
a
circle
regulated
the
course
of
the
sun
an
old
man
who
was
brought
there
at
certain
hours
of
the
day
and
who
made
knots
as
he
consulted
his
watch
seemed
to
me
to
be
charged
with
the
notation
of
the
course
of
the
hours
i
attributed
to
myself
an
influence
over
the
course
of
the
moon
and
i
believed
that
this
star
had
been
struck
by
the
thunderbolt
of
the
most
high
which
had
traced
on
its
face
the
imprint
of
the
mask
which
i
had
observed
i
attributed
a
mystical
signification
to
the
conversations
of
the
warders
and
of
my
companions
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
were
the
representatives
of
all
the
races
of
the
earth
and
that
we
had
undertaken
between
us
to
the
course
of
the
stars
and
to
give
a
wider
development
to
the
system
an
error
in
my
opinion
had
crept
into
the
general
combination
of
numbers
and
thence
came
all
the
ills
of
humanity
i
believed
also
that
the
celestial
spirits
had
taken
human
forms
and
assisted
at
this
general
congress
seeming
though
they
did
to
be
concerned
with
but
ordinary
occupations
my
own
part
seemed
to
me
to
be
the
of
universal
harmony
by
cabbalistic
art
and
i
had
to
seek
a
solution
by
evoking
the
occult
forces
of
various
religions
so
far
we
have
no
doubt
the
confusions
of
madness
in
which
what
may
indeed
be
the
symbol
is
taken
for
the
thing
itself
but
now
observe
what
follows
i
seemed
to
myself
a
hero
living
under
the
very
eyes
of
the
gods
everything
in
nature
assumed
new
aspects
and
secret
voices
came
to
me
from
the
plants
the
trees
animals
the
meanest
insects
to
warn
and
to
encourage
me
the
words
of
my
companions
had
mysterious
messages
the
sense
of
which
i
alone
understood
things
without
form
and
without
life
lent
themselves
to
the
designs
of
my
mind
out
of
combinations
of
stones
the
figures
of
angles
crevices
or
openings
the
shape
of
leaves
out
of
colours
odours
and
sounds
i
saw
unknown
harmonies
come
forth
is
it
i
said
to
myself
i
can
possibly
have
lived
so
long
outside
nature
without
identifying
myself
with
her
all
things
five
all
things
are
in
motion
all
things
correspond
the
magnetic
rays
emanating
from
myself
or
others
traverse
without
obstacle
the
infinite
chain
of
created
things
a
transparent
network
covers
the
world
whose
loose
threads
communicate
more
and
more
closely
with
the
planets
and
the
stars
now
a
captive
upon
the
earth
i
hold
converse
with
the
starry
choir
which
is
feelingly
a
part
of
my
joys
and
sorrows
to
have
thus
realised
that
central
secret
of
the
mystics
from
pythagoras
onwards
the
secret
which
the
smaragdine
tablet
of
hermes
betrays
in
its
as
things
are
below
so
are
they
above
which
boehme
has
classed
in
his
teaching
of
signatures
and
swedenborg
has
systematised
in
his
doctrine
of
correspondences
does
it
matter
very
much
that
he
arrived
at
it
by
way
of
the
obscure
and
fatal
initiation
of
madness
truth
and
especially
that
soul
of
truth
which
is
poetry
may
be
reached
by
many
roads
and
a
road
is
not
necessarily
misleading
because
it
is
dangerous
or
forbidden
here
is
one
who
has
gazed
at
light
till
it
has
blinded
him
and
for
us
all
that
is
important
is
that
he
has
seen
something
not
that
his
eyesight
has
been
too
weak
to
endure
the
pressure
of
light
overflowing
the
world
from
beyond
the
world
and
here
we
arrive
at
the
fundamental
principle
which
is
at
once
the
substance
and
the
æsthetics
of
the
sonnets
composed
as
he
explains
in
that
state
of
meditation
which
the
germans
would
call
supernaturalistic
in
one
which
i
will
quote
he
is
explicit
and
seems
to
state
a
doctrine

but
in
the
other
sonnets
in
which
i
have
quoted
in
desdichado
myrtho
and
the
rest
he
would
seem
to
be
deliberately
obscure
or
at
least
his
obscurity
results
to
some
extent
from
the
state
of
mind
which
he
describes
in
rêve
et
la
vie
i
then
saw
vaguely
drifting
into
form
plastic
images
of
antiquity
which
outlined
themselves
became
definite
and
seemed
to
represent
symbols
of
which
i
only
seized
the
idea
with
difficulty
nothing
could
more
precisely
represent
the
impression
made
by
these
sonnets
in
which
for
the
first
time
in
french
words
are
used
as
the
ingredients
of
an
evocation
as
themselves
not
merely
colour
and
sound
but
symbol
here
are
words
which
create
an
atmosphere
by
the
actual
suggestive
quality
of
their
syllables
as
according
to
the
theory
of
mallarmé
they
should
do
as
in
the
recent
attempts
of
the
symbolists
writer
after
writer
has
endeavoured
to
lure
them
into
doing
persuaded
as
gérard
was
of
the
sensitive
unity
of
all
nature
he
was
able
to
trace
resemblances
where
others
saw
only
divergences
and
the
setting
together
of
unfamiliar
and
apparently
alien
things
which
comes
so
strangely
upon
us
in
his
verse
was
perhaps
an
actual
sight
of
what
it
is
our
misfortune
not
to
see
his
genius
to
which
madness
had
come
as
the
liberating
the
precipitating
spirit
disengaging
its
finer
essence
consisted
in
a
power
of
materialising
vision
whatever
is
most
volatile
and
unseizable
in
vision
and
without
losing
the
sense
of
mystery
or
that
quality
which
gives
its
charm
to
the
intangible
madness
then
in
him
had
lit
up
as
if
by
the
hidden
links
of
distant
and
divergent
things
perhaps
in
somewhat
the
same
manner
as
that
in
which
a
similarly
new
startling
perhaps
sight
of
things
is
gained
by
the
artificial
stimulation
of
haschisch
opium
and
those
other
drugs
by
which
vision
is
produced
deliberately
and
the
soul
sitting
safe
within
the
perilous
circle
of
its
own
magic
looks
out
on
the
panorama
which
either
rises
out
of
the
darkness
before
it
or
drifts
from
itself
into
the
darkness
the
very
imagery
of
these
sonnets
is
the
imagery
which
is
known
to
all
dreamers
of
bought
dreams
au
cœur
violet
fleur
de
sainte
gudule
le
temple
au
péristyle
immense
la
grotte
où
nage
la
syrène
the
dreamer
of
bought
dreams
has
seen
them
all
but
no
one
before
gérard
realised
that
such
things
as
these
might
be
the
basis
of
almost
a
new
æsthetics
did
he
himself
realise
all
that
he
had
done
or
was
it
left
for
mallarmé
to
theorise
upon
what
gérard
had
but
divined
that
he
made
the
discovery
there
is
no
doubt
and
we
owe
to
the
fortunate
accident
of
madness
one
of
the
foundations
of
what
may
be
called
the
practical
æsthetics
of
symbolism
look
again
at
that
sonnet
and
you
will
see
in
it
not
only
the
method
of
mallarmé
but
much
of
the
most
intimate
manner
of
verlaine
the
first
four
lines
with
their
fluid
rhythm
their
repetitions
and
echoes
their
delicate
evasions
might
have
been
written
by
verlaine
in
the
later
part
the
firmness
of
the
rhythms
and
the
jewelled
significance
of
the
words
are
like
mallarmé
at
his
finest
so
that
in
a
single
sonnet
we
may
fairly
claim
to
see
a
of
the
styles
of
mallarmé
and
verlaine
at
once
with
verlaine
the
resemblance
goes
perhaps
no
further
with
mallarmé
it
goes
to
the
very
roots
the
whole
man
being
certainly
his
style
gérard
de
nerval
then
had
divined
before
all
the
world
that
poetry
should
be
a
miracle
not
a
hymn
to
beauty
nor
the
description
of
beauty
nor
beauty
mirror
but
beauty
itself
the
colour
fragrance
and
form
of
the
imagined
flower
as
it
blossoms
again
out
of
the
page
vision
the
vision
had
come
to
him
beyond
if
not
against
his
will
and
he
knew
that
vision
is
the
root
out
of
which
the
flower
must
grow
vision
had
taught
him
symbol
and
he
knew
that
it
is
by
symbol
alone
that
the
flower
can
take
visible
form
he
knew
that
the
whole
mystery
of
beauty
can
never
be
comprehended
by
the
crowd
and
that
while
clearness
is
a
virtue
of
style
perfect
explicitness
is
not
a
necessary
virtue
so
it
was
with
disdain
as
well
as
with
confidence
that
he
allowed
these
sonnets
to
be
overheard
it
was
enough
for
him
to
say
rêvé
dans
la
grotte
où
nage
la
syrène
and
to
speak
it
might
be
the
siren
language
remembering
her
it
will
be
my
last
madness
he
wrote
to
believe
myself
a
poet
let
criticism
cure
me
of
it
criticism
in
his
own
day
even
criticism
could
but
be
disconcerted
by
a
novelty
so
unexampled
it
is
only
now
that
the
best
critics
in
france
are
beginning
to
realise
how
great
in
themselves
and
how
great
in
their
influence
are
these
sonnets
which
forgotten
by
the
world
for
nearly
fifty
years
have
all
the
while
been
secretly
bringing
new
æsthetics
into
french
poetry
théophile
gautier
gautier
has
spoken
for
himself
in
a
famous
passage
of
de
i
am
a
man
of
the
homeric
age
the
world
in
which
i
live
is
not
my
world
and
i
understand
nothing
of
the
society
which
surrounds
me
for
me
christ
did
not
come
i
am
as
much
a
pagan
as
alcibiades
or
phidias
i
have
never
plucked
on
golgotha
the
flowers
of
the
passion
and
the
deep
stream
that
flows
from
the
side
of
the
crucified
and
sets
a
crimson
girdle
about
the
world
has
never
washed
me
in
its
flood
my
rebellious
body
will
not
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
the
soul
and
my
flesh
will
not
endure
to
be
mortified
i
find
the
earth
as
beautiful
as
the
sky
and
i
think
that
perfection
of
form
is
virtue
i
have
no
gift
for
spirituality
i
prefer
a
statue
to
a
ghost
full
noon
to
twilight
three
things
delight
me
gold
marble
and
purple
brilliance
solidity
colour
i
have
looked
on
love
in
the
light
of
antiquity
and
as
a
piece
of
sculpture
more
or
less
perfect
all
my
life
i
have
been
concerned
with
the
form
of
the
flagon
never
with
the
quality
of
its
contents
that
is
part
of
a
confession
of
faith
and
it
is
spoken
with
absolute
sincerity
gautier
knew
himself
and
could
tell
the
truth
about
himself
as
simply
as
impartially
as
if
he
had
been
describing
a
work
of
art
or
is
he
not
indeed
describing
a
work
of
art
was
not
that
very
state
of
mind
that
finished
and
limited
temperament
a
thing
which
he
had
collaborated
with
nature
in
making
with
an
effective
heightening
of
what
was
most
natural
to
him
in
the
spirit
of
art
gautier
saw
the
world
as
mineral
as
metal
as
pigment
as
rock
tree
water
as
architecture
costume
under
sunlight
gas
in
all
the
colours
that
light
can
bring
out
of
built
or
growing
things
he
saw
it
as
contour
movement
he
saw
all
that
a
painter
sees
when
the
painter
sets
himself
to
copy
not
to
create
he
was
the
finest
copyist
who
ever
used
paint
with
a
pen
nothing
that
can
be
expressed
in
technical
terms
escaped
him
there
were
no
technical
terms
which
he
could
not
reduce
to
an
orderly
beauty
but
he
absorbed
all
this
visible
world
with
the
hardly
discriminating
impartiality
of
the
retina
he
had
no
moods
was
not
to
be
distracted
by
a
sentiment
heard
no
voices
saw
nothing
but
darkness
the
negation
of
day
in
night
he
was
tirelessly
attentive
he
had
no
secrets
of
his
own
and
could
keep
none
of
naturels
he
could
describe
every
ray
of
the
nine
thousand
precious
stones
in
the
throne
of
ivan
the
terrible
in
the
treasury
of
the
kremlin
but
he
could
tell
you
nothing
of
one
of
maeterlinck
bees
the
five
senses
made
gautier
for
themselves
that
they
might
become
articulate
he
speaks
for
them
all
with
a
dreadful
unconcern
all
his
words
are
in
love
with
matter
and
they
enjoy
their
lust
and
have
no
recollection
if
the
body
did
not
dwindle
and
expand
to
some
ignoble
physical
conclusion
if
wrinkles
did
not
creep
yellowing
up
necks
and
the
fire
in
a
man
blood
did
not
lose
its
heat
he
would
always
be
content
everything
that
he
cared
for
in
the
world
was
to
be
had
except
perhaps
rest
from
striving
after
it
only
everything
would
one
day
come
to
an
end
after
a
slow
spoiling
decrepit
colourless
uneager
things
shocked
him
and
it
was
with
an
acute
almost
disinterested
pity
that
he
watched
himself
die
all
his
life
gautier
adored
life
and
all
the
processes
and
forms
of
life
a
pagan
a
young
roman
hard
and
delicate
with
something
of
cruelty
in
his
sympathy
with
things
that
could
be
seen
and
handled
he
would
have
hated
the
soul
if
he
had
ever
really
apprehended
it
for
its
qualifying
and
disturbing
power
upon
the
body
no
other
modern
writer
no
writer
perhaps
has
described
nakedness
with
so
abstract
a
heat
of
rapture
like
when
he
sees
mlle
de
maupin
for
the
first
and
last
time
he
is
the
artist
before
he
is
the
lover
and
he
is
the
lover
while
he
is
the
artist
it
was
above
all
things
the
human
body
whose
contours
and
colours
he
wished
to
fix
for
eternity
in
the
robust
art
of
verse
marble
onyx
enamel
and
it
was
not
the
body
as
a
frail
perishable
thing
and
a
thing
to
be
pitied
that
he
wanted
to
perpetuate
it
was
the
beauty
of
life
itself
imperishable
at
least
in
its
recurrence
he
loved
imperishable
things
the
body
as
generation
after
generation
refashions
it
the
world
as
it
is
restored
and
rebuilt
and
then
gems
and
hewn
stone
and
carved
ivory
and
woven
tapestry
he
loved
verse
for
its
solid
strictly
limited
resistant
form
which
while
prose
melts
and
drifts
about
it
remains
unalterable
indestructible
words
he
knew
can
build
as
strongly
as
stones
and
not
merely
rise
to
music
like
the
walls
of
troy
but
be
themselves
music
as
well
as
structure
yet
as
in
visible
things
he
cared
only
for
hard
outline
and
rich
colour
so
in
words
too
he
had
no
love
of
and
was
content
to
do
without
that
softening
of
atmosphere
which
was
to
be
prized
by
those
who
came
after
him
as
the
thing
most
worth
seeking
even
his
verse
is
without
mystery
if
he
meditates
his
meditation
has
all
the
fixity
of
a
kind
of
sharp
precise
criticism
what
gautier
saw
he
saw
with
unparalleled
exactitude
he
allows
himself
no
poetic
license
or
room
for
fine
phrases
has
his
eye
always
on
the
object
and
really
uses
the
words
which
best
describe
it
whatever
they
may
be
so
his
books
of
travel
are
in
addition
to
being
other
things
and
not
by
any
means
states
of
soul
or
states
of
nerves
he
is
willing
to
give
you
information
and
able
to
give
it
to
you
without
deranging
his
periods
the
little
essay
on
leonardo
is
an
admirable
piece
of
artistic
divination
and
it
is
also
a
clear
simple
sufficient
account
of
the
man
his
temperament
and
his
way
of
work
the
study
of
baudelaire
reprinted
in
the
of
the
fleurs
du
mal
remains
the
one
satisfactory
summing
up
it
is
not
a
solution
of
the
enigma
which
baudelaire
personified
and
it
is
almost
the
most
coloured
and
perfumed
thing
in
words
which
he
ever
wrote
he
wrote
equally
well
about
cities
poets
novelists
painters
or
sculptors
he
did
not
understand
one
better
than
the
other
or
feel
less
sympathy
for
one
than
for
another
he
the
parfait
magicien
ès
lettres
françaises
to
whom
faultless
words
came
in
faultlessly
beautiful
order
could
realise
against
balzac
himself
that
balzac
had
a
style
he
possesses
though
he
did
not
think
so
a
style
and
a
very
beautiful
style
the
necessary
inevitable
mathematical
style
of
his
ideas
he
appreciated
ingres
as
justly
as
he
appreciated
el
greco
he
went
through
the
louvre
room
by
room
saying
the
right
thing
about
each
painter
in
turn
he
did
not
say
the
final
thing
he
said
nothing
which
we
have
to
pause
and
think
over
before
we
see
the
whole
of
its
truth
or
apprehend
the
whole
of
its
beauty
truth
in
him
comes
to
us
almost
literally
through
the
eyesight
and
with
the
same
beautiful
clearness
as
if
it
were
one
of
those
visible
things
which
delighted
him

gustave
flaubert
is
an
attempt
as
flaubert
himself
his
best
critic
has
told
us
to
perpetuate
a
mirage
by
applying
to
antiquity
the
methods
of
the
modern
novel
by
the
modern
novel
he
means
the
novel
as
he
had
reconstructed
it
he
means
that
perfect
book
is
perfect
because
flaubert
had
for
once
found
exactly
the
subject
suited
to
his
method
had
made
his
method
and
his
subject
one
on
his
scientific
side
flaubert
is
a
realist
but
there
is
another
perhaps
a
more
intimately
personal
side
on
which
he
is
lyrical
lyrical
in
a
large
sweeping
way
the
lyric
poet
in
him
made
tentation
de
the
analyst
made
sentimentale
but
in
we
find
the
analyst
and
the
lyric
poet
in
equilibrium
it
is
the
history
of
a
woman
as
carefully
observed
as
any
story
that
has
ever
been
written
and
observed
in
surroundings
of
the
most
ordinary
kind
but
flaubert
finds
the
romantic
material
which
he
loved
the
materials
of
beauty
in
precisely
that
temperament
which
he
studies
so
patiently
and
so
cruelly
madame
bovary
is
a
little
woman
half
vulgar
and
half
hysterical
incapable
of
a
fine
passion
but
her
trivial
desires
her
futile
aspirations
after
pleasures
and
ideals
give
to
flaubert
all
that
he
wants
the
opportunity
to
create
beauty
out
of
reality
what
is
common
in
the
imagination
of
madame
bovary
becomes
exquisite
in
flaubert
rendering
of
it
and
by
that
counterpoise
of
a
commonness
in
the
subject
he
is
saved
from
any
vague
ascents
of
rhetoric
in
his
rendering
of
it
in
writing
flaubert
set
himself
to
renew
the
historical
novel
as
he
had
renewed
the
novel
of
manners
he
would
have
admitted
doubtless
that
perfect
success
in
the
historical
novel
is
impossible
by
the
nature
of
the
case
we
are
at
best
only
half
conscious
of
the
reality
of
the
things
about
us
only
able
to
translate
them
approximately
into
any
form
of
art
how
much
is
left
over
in
the
closest
transcription
of
a
mere
line
of
houses
in
a
street
of
a
passing
steamer
of
one
neighbour
of
the
point
of
view
of
a
foreigner
looking
along
piccadilly
of
one
own
state
of
mind
moment
by
moment
as
one
walks
from
oxford
circus
to
the
marble
arch
think
then
of
the
attempts
to
reconstruct
no
matter
what
period
of
the
past
to
distinguish
the
difference
in
the
aspect
of
a
world
perhaps
bossed
with
castles
and
ridged
with
ramparts
to
two
individualities
encased
within
flaubert
chose
his
antiquity
wisely
a
period
of
which
we
know
too
little
to
confuse
us
a
city
of
which
no
stone
is
left
on
another
the
minds
of
barbarians
who
have
left
us
no
psychological
documents
be
sure
i
have
made
no
fantastic
carthage
he
says
proudly
pointing
to
his
documents
ammianus
marcellinus
who
has
furnished
him
with
the
form
of
a
door
the
bible
and
theophrastus
from
which
he
obtains
his
perfumes
and
his
precious
stones
gesenius
from
whom
he
gets
his
punic
names
the
de
des
as
for
the
temple
of
tanit
i
am
sure
of
having
reconstructed
it
as
it
was
with
the
treatise
of
the
syrian
goddess
with
the
medals
of
the
duc
de
luynes
with
what
is
known
of
the
temple
at
jerusalem
with
a
passage
of
jerome
quoted
by
seldon
diis
with
the
plan
of
the
temple
of
gozzo
which
is
quite
carthaginian
and
best
of
all
with
the
ruins
of
the
temple
of
thugga
which
i
have
seen
myself
with
my
own
eyes
and
of
which
no
traveller
or
antiquarian
so
far
as
i
know
has
ever
spoken
but
that
after
all
as
he
admits
when
that
is
he
has
proved
point
by
point
his
minute
accuracy
to
all
that
is
known
of
ancient
carthage
his
faithfulness
to
every
indication
which
can
serve
for
his
guidance
his
patience
in
grouping
rather
than
his
daring
in
the
invention
of
action
and
details
that
is
not
the
question
i
care
little
enough
for
archæology
if
the
colour
is
not
uniform
if
the
details
are
out
of
keeping
if
the
manners
do
not
spring
from
the
religion
and
the
actions
from
the
passions
if
the
characters
are
not
consistent
if
the
costumes
are
not
appropriate
to
the
habits
and
the
architecture
to
the
climate
if
in
a
word
there
is
not
harmony
i
am
in
error
if
not
no
and
there
precisely
is
the
definition
of
the
one
merit
which
can
give
a
historical
novel
the
right
to
exist
and
at
the
same
time
a
definition
of
the
merit
which
sets
above
all
other
historical
novels
everything
in
the
book
is
strange
some
of
it
might
easily
be
bewildering
some
revolting
but
all
is
in
harmony
the
harmony
is
like
that
of
eastern
music
not
immediately
conveying
its
charm
or
even
the
secret
of
its
measure
to
western
ears
but
a
monotony
coiling
perpetually
upon
itself
after
a
severe
law
of
its
own
or
rather
it
is
like
a
fresco
painted
gravely
in
hard
definite
colours
firmly
detached
from
a
background
of
burning
sky
a
procession
of
barbarians
each
in
the
costume
of
his
country
passes
across
the
wall
there
are
battles
in
which
elephants
fight
with
men
an
army
besieges
a
great
city
or
rots
to
death
in
a
defile
between
mountains
the
ground
is
paved
with
dead
men
crosses
each
bearing
its
living
burden
stand
against
the
sky
a
few
figures
of
men
and
women
appear
again
and
again
expressing
by
their
gestures
the
soul
of
the
story
flaubert
himself
has
pointed
with
his
unerring
to
the
main
defect
of
his
book
the
pedestal
is
too
large
for
the
statue
there
should
have
been
as
he
says
a
hundred
pages
more
about
salammbô
he
declares
there
is
not
in
my
book
an
isolated
or
gratuitous
description
all
are
useful
to
my
characters
and
have
an
influence
near
or
remote
on
the
action
this
is
true
and
yet
all
the
same
the
pedestal
is
too
large
for
the
statue
salammbô
always
surrounded
with
grave
and
exquisite
things
has
something
of
the
somnambulism
which
enters
into
the
heroism
of
judith
she
has
a
hieratic
beauty
and
a
consciousness
as
pale
and
vague
as
the
moon
whom
she
worships
she
passes
before
us
her
body
saturated
with
perfumes
encrusted
with
jewels
like
an
idol
her
head
turreted
with
violet
hair
the
gold
chain
tinkling
between
her
ankles
and
is
hardly
more
than
an
attitude
a
fixed
gesture
like
the
eastern
women
whom
one
sees
passing
with
oblique
eyes
and
mouths
painted
into
smiles
their
faces
curiously
traced
into
a
work
of
art
in
the
languid
movements
of
a
pantomimic
dance
the
soul
behind
those
eyes
the
temperament
under
that
at
times
almost
terrifying
mask
salammbô
is
as
inarticulate
for
us
as
the
serpent
to
whose
drowsy
beauty
capable
of
such
sudden
awakenings
hers
seems
half
akin
they
move
before
us
in
a
kind
of
hieratic
pantomime
a
coloured
expressive
thing
signifying
nothing
mâtho
maddened
with
love
in
an
invincible
stupor
like
those
who
have
drunk
some
draught
of
which
they
are
to
die
has
the
same
somnambulistic
life
the
prey
of
venus
he
has
an
almost
literal
insanity
which
as
flaubert
reminds
us
is
true
to
the
ancient
view
of
that
passion
he
is
the
only
quite
vivid
person
in
the
book
and
he
lives
with
the
intensity
of
a
wild
beast
a
life
blinded
alike
from
every
inner
and
outer
interruption
to
one
or
two
fixed
ideas
the
others
have
their
places
in
the
picture
fall
into
their
attitudes
naturally
remain
so
many
coloured
outlines
for
us
the
illusion
is
perfect
these
people
may
not
be
the
real
people
of
history
but
at
least
they
have
no
no
christian
tinge
in
their
minds
the
metaphors
are
few
the
epithets
definite
flaubert
tells
us
of
his
style
in
this
book
where
as
he
says
he
has
sacrificed
less
to
the
amplitude
of
the
phrase
and
to
the
period
than
in
the
movement
here
is
in
briefer
steps
with
a
more
earnest
gravity
without
any
of
the
engaging
weakness
of
adjectives
the
style
is
never
archaic
it
is
absolutely
simple
the
precise
word
being
put
always
for
the
precise
thing
but
it
obtains
a
dignity
a
historical
remoteness
by
the
large
seriousness
of
its
manner
the
absence
of
modern
ways
of
thought
which
in
bovary
bring
with
them
an
instinctively
modern
cadence
is
written
with
the
severity
of
history
but
flaubert
notes
every
detail
visually
as
a
painter
notes
the
details
of
natural
things
a
slave
is
being
flogged
under
a
tree
flaubert
notes
the
movement
of
the
thong
as
it
flies
and
tells
us
the
thongs
as
they
whistled
through
the
air
sent
the
bark
of
the
plane
trees
flying
before
the
battle
of
the
macar
the
barbarians
are
awaiting
the
approach
of
the
carthaginian
army
first
the
barbarians
were
surprised
to
see
the
ground
undulate
in
the
distance
clouds
of
dust
rise
and
whirl
over
the
desert
through
which
are
seen
glimpses
of
horns
and
as
it
seems
wings
are
they
bulls
or
birds
or
a
mirage
of
the
desert
the
barbarians
watch
intently
at
last
they
made
out
several
transverse
bars
bristling
with
uniform
points
the
bars
became
denser
larger
dark
mounds
swayed
from
side
to
side
suddenly
square
bushes
came
into
view
they
were
elephants
and
lances
a
single
shout
carthaginians
arose
observe
how
all
that
is
seen
as
if
the
eyes
unaided
by
the
intelligence
had
found
out
everything
for
themselves
taking
in
one
indication
after
another
instinctively
flaubert
puts
himself
in
the
place
of
his
characters
not
so
much
to
think
for
them
as
to
see
for
them
compare
the
style
of
flaubert
in
each
of
his
books
and
you
will
find
that
each
book
has
its
own
rhythm
perfectly
appropriate
to
its
the
style
which
has
almost
every
merit
and
hardly
a
fault
becomes
what
it
is
by
a
process
very
different
from
that
of
most
writers
careful
of
form
read
chateaubriand
gautier
even
baudelaire
and
you
will
find
that
the
aim
of
these
writers
has
been
to
construct
a
style
which
shall
be
adaptable
to
every
occasion
but
without
structural
change
the
cadence
is
always
the
same
the
most
exquisite
of
gautier
can
be
translated
rhythm
for
rhythm
into
english
without
difficulty
once
you
have
mastered
the
tune
you
have
merely
to
go
on
every
verse
will
be
the
same
but
flaubert
is
so
difficult
to
translate
because
he
has
no
fixed
rhythm
his
prose
keeps
step
with
no
regular
he
invents
the
rhythm
of
every
sentence
he
changes
his
cadence
with
every
mood
or
for
the
convenience
of
every
fact
he
has
no
theory
of
beauty
in
form
apart
from
what
it
expresses
for
him
form
is
a
living
thing
the
physical
body
of
thought
which
it
clothes
and
interprets
if
i
call
stones
blue
it
is
because
blue
is
the
precise
word
believe
me
he
replies
to
criticism
beauty
comes
into
his
words
from
the
precision
with
which
they
express
definite
things
definite
ideas
definite
sensations
and
in
his
book
where
the
material
is
so
hard
apparently
so
unmalleable
it
is
a
beauty
of
sheer
exactitude
which
fills
it
from
end
to
end
a
beauty
of
measure
and
order
seen
equally
in
the
departure
of
the
doves
of
carthage
at
the
time
of
their
flight
into
sicily
and
in
the
lions
feasting
on
the
corpses
of
the
barbarians
in
the
defile
between
the
mountains
charles
baudelaire
baudelaire
is
little
known
and
much
misunderstood
in
england
only
one
english
writer
has
ever
done
him
justice
or
said
anything
adequate
about
him
as
long
ago
as
swinburne
introduced
baudelaire
to
english
readers
in
the
columns
of
the
it
is
amusing
to
remember
in
he
added
a
few
more
words
of
just
and
subtle
praise
in
his
book
on
blake
and
in
the
same
year
wrote
the
magnificent
elegy
on
his
death
atque
there
have
been
occasional
of
irrelevant
abuse
or
contempt
and
the
name
of
baudelaire
generally
misspelled
is
the
journalist
handiest
brickbat
for
hurling
at
random
in
the
name
of
respectability
does
all
this
mean
that
we
are
waking
up
over
here
to
the
consciousness
of
one
of
the
great
literary
forces
of
the
age
a
force
which
has
been
felt
in
every
other
country
but
ours
it
would
be
a
useful
influence
for
us
baudelaire
desired
perfection
and
we
have
never
realised
that
perfection
is
a
thing
to
aim
at
he
only
did
what
he
could
do
supremely
well
and
he
was
in
poverty
all
his
life
not
because
he
would
not
work
but
because
he
would
work
only
at
certain
things
the
things
which
he
could
hope
to
do
to
his
own
satisfaction
of
the
men
of
letters
of
our
age
he
was
the
most
scrupulous
he
spent
his
whole
life
in
writing
one
book
of
verse
out
of
which
all
french
poetry
has
come
since
his
time
one
book
of
prose
in
which
prose
becomes
a
fine
art
some
criticism
which
is
the
sanest
subtlest
and
surest
which
his
generation
produced
and
a
translation
which
is
better
than
a
marvellous
original
what
would
french
poetry
be
if
baudelaire
had
never
existed
as
different
a
thing
from
what
it
is
as
english
poetry
would
be
without
rossetti
neither
of
them
is
quite
among
the
greatest
poets
but
they
are
more
fascinating
than
the
greatest
they
influence
more
minds
and
baudelaire
was
an
equally
great
critic
he
discovered
poe
wagner
and
manet
where
even
with
his
vast
materials
his
vast
general
talent
for
criticism
went
wrong
in
contemporary
judgments
baudelaire
was
infallibly
right
he
wrote
neither
verse
nor
prose
with
ease
but
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
write
either
without
inspiration
his
work
is
without
abundance
but
it
is
without
waste
it
is
made
out
of
his
whole
intellect
and
all
his
nerves
every
poem
is
a
train
of
thought
and
every
essay
is
the
record
of
sensation
this
romantic
had
something
classic
in
his
moderation
moderation
which
becomes
at
times
as
terrifying
as
poe
logic
to
cultivate
one
hysteria
so
calmly
and
to
affront
the
reader
hypocrite
lecteur
mon
semblable
mon
frère
as
a
judge
rather
than
as
a
penitent
to
be
a
casuist
in
confession
to
be
so
much
a
moralist
with
so
keen
a
sense
of
the
ecstasy
of
evil
that
has
always
bewildered
the
world
even
in
his
own
country
where
the
artist
is
allowed
to
live
as
experimentally
as
he
writes
baudelaire
lived
and
died
solitary
secret
a
confessor
of
sins
who
has
never
told
the
whole
truth
mauvais
of
his
own
sonnet
an
ascetic
of
passion
a
hermit
of
the
brothel
to
understand
not
baudelaire
but
what
we
can
of
him
we
must
read
not
only
the
four
volumes
of
his
collected
works
but
every
document
in
crépet
posthumes
and
above
all
the
letters
and
these
have
only
now
been
collected
into
a
volume
under
the
care
of
an
editor
who
has
done
more
for
baudelaire
than
any
one
since
crépet
baudelaire
put
into
his
letters
only
what
he
cared
to
reveal
of
himself
at
a
given
moment
he
has
a
different
angle
to
distract
the
sight
of
every
observer
and
let
no
one
think
that
he
knows
baudelaire
when
he
has
read
the
letters
to
the
friend
and
publisher
to
whom
he
showed
his
business
side
or
the
letters
to
la
présidente
the
touchstone
of
his
et
idéal
his
chief
experiment
in
the
higher
sentiments
some
of
his
carefully
hidden
virtues
peep
out
at
moments
it
is
true
but
nothing
that
everybody
has
not
long
been
aware
of
we
hear
of
his
with
money
with
with
his
own
health
the
tragedy
of
the
life
which
he
chose
as
he
chose
all
things
poetry
jeanne
duval
the
artificial
paradises
deliberately
is
made
a
little
clearer
to
us
we
can
moralise
over
it
if
we
like
but
the
man
remains
baffling
and
will
probably
never
be
discovered
as
it
is
much
of
the
value
of
the
book
consists
in
those
glimpses
into
his
mind
and
intentions
which
he
allowed
people
now
and
then
to
see
writing
to
to
flaubert
to
soulary
he
sometimes
lets
out
through
mere
sensitiveness
to
an
intelligence
capable
of
understanding
him
some
little
interesting
secret
thus
it
is
to
that
he
defines
and
explains
the
origin
and
real
meaning
of
the
poèmes

même
voilà
ce
que
voulu
faire
and
writing
to
some
obscure
person
he
will
take
the
trouble
to
be
even
more
explicit
in
this
symbol
of
the

plus

de
que

it
is
to
another
casual
person
that
he
speaks
out
still
more
intimately
and
the
occasion
of
his
writing
is
some
thrill
of
gratitude
towards
one
who
had
at
last
done
a
little
justice
not
to
himself
but
to
manet

it
is
in
such
glimpses
as
these
that
we
see
something
of
baudelaire
in
his
letters
edmond
and
jules
de
goncourt
my
first
visit
to
edmond
de
goncourt
was
in
may
i
remember
my
immense
curiosity
about
that
house
beautiful
at
auteuil
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
and
my
excitement
as
i
rang
the
bell
and
was
shown
at
once
into
the
garden
where
goncourt
was
just
saying
to
some
friends
he
was
carelessly
dressed
without
a
collar
and
with
the
usual
loosely
knotted
large
white
scarf
rolled
round
his
neck
he
was
wearing
a
straw
hat
and
it
was
only
afterwards
that
i
could
see
the
fine
sweep
of
the
white
hair
falling
across
the
forehead
i
thought
him
the
most
man
of
letters
i
had
ever
seen
for
he
had
at
once
the
distinction
of
race
of
fine
breeding
and
of
that
delicate
artistic
genius
which
with
him
was
so
intimately
a
part
of
things
beautiful
and
distinguished
he
had
the
eyes
of
an
old
eagle
a
general
air
of
dignified
collectedness
a
rare
and
a
rarely
charming
smile
which
came
out
like
a
ray
of
sunshine
in
the
instinctive
pleasure
of
having
said
a
witty
or
graceful
thing
to
which
one
response
had
been
immediate
when
he
took
me
indoors
into
that
house
which
was
a
museum
i
noticed
the
delicacy
of
his
hands
and
the
tenderness
with
which
he
handled
his
treasures
touching
them
as
if
he
loved
them
with
little
unconscious
murmurs
goût
quel
goût
these
rooms
with
their
embroidered
ceilings
were
filled
with
cabinets
of
beautiful
things
japanese
carvings
and
prints
the
miraculous
plongeuses
always
in
perfect
condition
cherche
le
albums
had
been
made
for
him
in
japan
and
in
these
he
inserted
prints
mounting
others
upon
silver
and
gold
paper
which
formed
a
sort
of
frame
he
showed
me
his
designs
among
which
i
remember
his
pointing
out
one
a
chardin
i
think
as
the
first
he
had
ever
bought
he
had
been
sixteen
at
the
time
and
he
bought
it
for
twelve
francs
when
we
came
to
the
study
the
room
in
which
he
worked
he
showed
me
all
of
his
own
first
editions
carefully
bound
and
first
editions
of
flaubert
baudelaire
gautier
with
those
less
interesting
to
me
of
the
men
of
later
generations
he
spoke
of
himself
and
his
brother
with
a
serene
pride
which
seemed
to
me
perfectly
dignified
and
appropriate
and
i
remember
his
speaking
with
a
parenthetic
disdain
of
the
scandinave
in
which
it
seemed
to
him
that
france
was
trying
to
envelop
herself
at
the
best
it
would
be
but
mauvais
of
the
endeavour
which
he
and
his
brother
had
made
to
represent
the
only
thing
worth
representing
vie
vécue
la
vraie
as
in
painting
he
said
all
depends
on
the
way
of
seeing
out
of
men
who
will
describe
what
they
have
all
seen
it
is
only
the
who
will
find
the
right
way
of
expressing
it
there
is
a
true
thing
i
have
said
in
my
journal
he
went
on
the
thing
is
to
find
a
lorgnette
and
he
put
up
his
hands
to
his
eyes
adjusting
them
carefully
through
which
to
see
things
my
brother
and
i
invented
a
lorgnette
and
the
young
men
have
taken
it
from
us
how
true
that
is
and
how
significantly
it
states
just
what
is
most
essential
in
the
work
of
the
goncourts
it
is
a
new
way
of
seeing
literally
a
new
way
of
seeing
which
they
have
invented
and
it
is
in
the
invention
of
this
that
they
have
invented
that
new
language
of
which
purists
have
so
long
so
vainly
and
so
thanklessly
complained
you
remember
that
saying
of
masson
the
mask
of
gautier
in
demailly
i
am
a
man
for
whom
the
visible
world
exists
well
that
is
true
also
of
the
goncourts
but
in
a
different
way
the
delicacies
of
fine
literature
that
phrase
of
pater
always
comes
into
my
mind
when
i
think
of
the
goncourts
and
indeed
pater
seems
to
me
the
only
english
writer
who
has
ever
handled
language
at
all
in
their
manner
or
spirit
i
frequently
heard
pater
refer
to
certain
of
their
books
to
gervaisais
to
du
xviiie
siècle
to
with
a
passing
objection
to
what
he
called
the
immodesty
of
this
last
book
and
a
strong
emphasis
in
the
assertion
that
that
was
how
it
seemed
to
him
a
book
should
be
written
i
repeated
this
once
to
goncourt
trying
to
give
him
some
idea
of
what
patera
work
was
like
and
he
lamented
that
his
ignorance
of
english
prevented
him
from
what
he
instinctively
realised
would
be
so
intimate
an
enjoyment
pater
was
of
course
far
more
scrupulous
more
limited
in
his
choice
of
epithet
less
feverish
in
his
variations
of
cadence
and
naturally
so
for
he
dealt
with
another
and
was
careful
of
another
kind
of
truth
but
with
both
there
was
that
passionately
intent
preoccupation
with
the
delicacies
of
fine
literature
both
achieved
a
style
of
the
most
personal
sincerity
grand
écrivain
de
tous
les
temps
said
goncourt
se
reconnaît
absolument
cela
a
une
langue
personnelle
une
langue
dont
chaque

chaque
ligne
est
signée
pour
le
lecteur
lettré
comme
si
son
nom
était
au
has
de
cette

de

and
this
style
in
both
was
accused
by
the
literary
criticism
of
its
generation
of
being
insincere
artificial
and
therefore
reprehensible
it
is
difficult
in
speaking
of
edmond
de
goncourt
to
avoid
attributing
to
him
the
whole
credit
of
the
work
which
has
so
long
borne
his
name
alone
that
is
an
error
which
he
himself
would
never
have
pardoned
frère
et
was
the
phrase
constantly
on
his
lips
and
in
his
journal
his
prefaces
he
has
done
full
justice
to
the
vivid
and
admirable
qualities
of
that
talent
which
all
the
same
would
seem
to
have
been
the
lesser
the
more
subservient
of
the
two
jules
i
think
had
a
more
active
sense
of
life
a
more
generally
human
curiosity
for
the
novels
of
edmond
written
since
his
brother
death
have
in
even
that
excessively
specialised
world
of
their
common
observation
a
yet
more
specialised
choice
and
direction
but
edmond
there
is
no
doubt
was
in
the
strictest
sense
the
writer
and
it
is
above
all
for
the
qualities
of
its
writing
that
the
work
of
the
goncourts
will
live
it
has
been
largely
concerned
with
truth
truth
to
the
minute
details
of
human
character
sensation
and
circumstance
and
also
of
the
document
the
exact
words
of
the
past
but
this
devotion
to
fact
to
the
curiosities
of
fact
has
been
united
with
an
even
more
persistent
devotion
to
the
curiosities
of
expression
they
have
invented
a
new
language
that
was
the
old
reproach
against
them
let
it
be
their
distinction
like
all
writers
of
an
elaborate
carefulness
they
have
been
accused
of
sacrificing
both
truth
and
beauty
to
deliberate
eccentricity
deliberate
their
style
certainly
was
eccentric
it
may
perhaps
sometimes
have
been
but
deliberately
eccentric
no
it
was
their
belief
that
a
writer
should
have
a
personal
style
a
style
as
peculiar
to
himself
as
his
handwriting
and
indeed
i
seem
to
see
in
the
handwriting
of
edmond
de
goncourt
just
the
characteristics
of
his
style
every
letter
is
formed
carefully
separately
with
a
certain
elegant
stiffness
it
is
beautiful
formal
too
regular
in
the
continual
slight
novelty
of
its
form
to
be
quite
clear
at
a
glance
very
personal
very
distinguished
writing
it
may
be
asserted
that
the
goncourts
are
not
merely
men
of
genius
but
are
perhaps
the
typical
men
of
letters
of
the
close
of
our
century
they
have
all
the
curiosities
and
the
acquirements
the
new
weaknesses
and
the
new
powers
that
belong
to
our
age
and
they
sum
up
in
themselves
certain
theories
aspirations
ways
of
looking
at
things
notions
of
literary
duty
and
artistic
conscience
which
have
only
lately
become
at
all
actual
and
some
of
which
owe
to
them
their
very
origin
to
be
not
merely
novelists
inventing
a
new
kind
of
novel
but
historians
not
merely
historians
but
the
historians
of
a
particular
century
and
of
what
was
intimate
and
what
is
unknown
in
it
to
be
also
discriminating
indeed
innovating
critics
of
art
but
of
a
certain
section
of
art
the
eighteenth
century
in
france
and
in
japan
to
collect
pictures
and
beautiful
things
always
of
the
french
and
japanese
eighteenth
century
these
excursions
in
so
many
directions
with
their
audacities
and
their
careful
limitations
their
bold
novelty
and
their
scrupulous
exactitude
in
detail
are
characteristic
of
what
is
the
finest
in
the
modern
conception
of
culture
and
the
modern
ideal
in
art
look
for
instance
at
the
goncourts
view
of
history

the
others

the
unconscious
of

time
forming
as
they
justly
say
intime

to
be
the
bookworm
and
the
magician
to
give
the
actual
documents
but
not
to
set
barren
fact
by
barren
fact
to
find
a
soul
and
a
voice
in
documents
to
make
them
more
living
and
more
charming
than
the
charm
of
life
itself
that
is
what
the
goncourts
have
done
and
it
is
through
this
conception
of
history
that
they
have
found
their
way
to
that
new
conception
of
the
novel
which
has
revolutionised
the
entire
art
of
fiction
they
wrote
in
in
the
preface
to
lacerteux

te
public
aime

faux
is
another
brave
declaration
in
the
same
preface
roman
est
un
roman
but
what
precisely
is
it
that
the
goncourts
understood
by
roman
vrai
the
old
notion
of
the
novel
was
that
it
should
be
an
entertaining
record
of
incidents
or
adventures
told
for
their
own
sake
a
plain
straightforward
narrative
of
facts
the
aim
being
to
produce
as
nearly
as
possible
an
effect
of
continuity
of
nothing
having
been
omitted
the
statement
so
to
speak
of
a
witness
on
oath
in
a
word
it
is
the
same
as
the
old
notion
of
history
ou
that
is
not
how
the
goncourts
apprehend
life
or
how
they
conceive
it
should
be
rendered
as
in
the
study
of
history
they
seek
mainly
the
caring
only
to
record
that
so
it
is
the
of
life
that
they
conceive
to
be
the
main
concern
the
real
inner
history
and
for
them
the
of
life
consists
in
the
noting
of
the
sensations
it
is
of
the
sensations
that
they
have
resolved
to
be
the
historians
not
of
action
nor
of
emotion
properly
speaking
nor
of
moral
conceptions
but
of
an
inner
life
which
is
all
made
up
of
the
perceptions
of
the
senses
it
is
scarcely
too
paradoxical
to
say
that
they
are
psychologists
for
whom
the
soul
does
not
exist
one
thing
they
know
exists
the
sensation
flashed
through
the
brain
the
image
on
the
mental
retina
having
found
that
they
bodily
omit
all
the
rest
as
of
no
importance
trusting
to
their
instinct
of
selection
of
retaining
all
that
really
matters
it
is
the
method
a
selection
made
almost
visually
the
method
of
the
painter
who
accumulates
detail
on
detail
in
his
patient
observation
of
his
subject
and
then
omits
everything
which
is
not
an
essential
part
of
the
which
he
sees
thus
the
new
conception
of
what
the
real
truth
of
things
consist
in
has
brought
with
it
inevitably
an
entirely
new
form
a
breaking
up
of
the
plain
straightforward
narrative
into
chapters
which
are
generally
quite
disconnected
and
sometimes
of
less
than
a
page
in
length
a
very
apt
image
of
this
new
curious
manner
of
narrative
has
been
found
somewhat
maliciously
by

that
certainly
is
the
danger
of
the
method
no
doubt
the
goncourts
in
their
passion
for
the
leave
out
certain
things
because
they
are
obvious
even
if
they
are
obviously
true
and
obviously
important
that
is
the
defect
of
their
quality
to
represent
life
by
a
series
of
moments
and
to
choose
these
moments
for
a
certain
subtlety
and
rarity
in
them
is
to
challenge
grave
perils
nor
are
these
the
only
perils
which
the
goncourts
have
constantly
before
them
there
are
others
essential
to
their
natures
to
their
preferences
and
first
of
all
as
we
may
see
on
every
page
of
that
miraculous
which
will
remain
doubtless
the
truest
deepest
most
poignant
piece
of
human
history
that
they
have
ever
written
they
are
sick
men
seeing
life
through
the
medium
of

this
unhealthy
sensitiveness
explains
much
the
singular
merits
as
well
as
certain
shortcomings
or
deviations
in
their
work
the
goncourts
vision
of
reality
might
almost
be
called
an
exaggerated
sense
of
the
truth
of
things
such
a
sense
as
diseased
nerves
inflict
upon
one
sharpening
the
acuteness
of
every
sensation
or
somewhat
such
a
sense
as
one
derives
from
haschisch
which
simply
intensifies
yet
in
a
veiled
and
fragrant
way
the
charm
or
the
disagreeableness
of
outward
things
the
notion
of
time
the
notion
of
space
what
the
goncourts
paint
is
the
subtler
poetry
of
reality
its
unusual
aspects
and
they
evoke
it
fleetingly
like
whistler
they
do
not
render
it
in
hard
outline
like
flaubert
like
manet
as
in
the
world
of
whistler
so
in
the
world
of
the
goncourts
we
see
cities
in
which
there
are
always
at
cremorne
and
fair
women
reflected
beautifully
and
curiously
in
mirrors
it
is
a
world
which
is
extraordinarily
real
but
there
is
choice
there
is
curiosity
in
the
aspect
of
reality
which
it
presents
compare
the
descriptions
which
form
so
large
a
part
of
the
work
of
the
goncourts
with
those
of
théophile
gautier
who
may
reasonably
be
said
to
have
introduced
the
practice
of
eloquent
writing
about
places
and
also
the
exact
description
of
them
gautier
describes
miraculously
but
it
is
after
all
the
ordinary
observation
carried
to
perfection
or
rather
the
ordinary
pictorial
observation
the
goncourts
only
tell
you
the
things
that
gautier
leaves
out
they
find
new
fantastic
points
of
view
discover
secrets
in
things
curiosities
of
beauty
often
acute
distressing
in
the
aspects
of
quite
ordinary
places
they
see
things
as
an
artist
an
artist
of
the
impressionist
kind
might
see
them
seeing
them
indeed
always
very
consciously
with
a
deliberate
attempt
upon
them
in
just
that
partial
selecting
creative
way
in
which
an
artist
looks
at
things
for
the
purpose
of
painting
a
picture
in
order
to
arrive
at
their
effects
they
shrink
from
no
sacrifice
from
no
excess
slang
neologism
forced
construction
archaism
barbarous
epithet
nothing
comes
amiss
to
them
so
long
as
it
tends
to
render
a
sensation
their
unique
care
is
that
the
phrase
should
live
should
palpitate
should
be
alert
exactly
expressive
in
expression
and
they
prefer
indeed
a
certain
perversity
in
their
relations
with
language
which
they
would
have
not
merely
a
passionate
and
sensuous
thing
but
complex
with
all
the
curiosities
of
a
delicately
depraved
instinct
it
is
the
accusation
of
the
severer
sort
of
french
critics
that
the
goncourts
have
invented
a
new
language
that
the
language
which
they
use
is
no
longer
the
calm
and
faultless
french
of
the
past
it
is
true
it
is
their
distinction
it
is
the
most
wonderful
of
all
their
inventions
in
order
to
render
new
sensations
a
new
vision
of
things
they
have
invented
a
new
language

before

his
life
had
become
a
legend
and
the
legend
is
even
now
not
to
be
disentangled
from
the
actual
occurrences
of
an
existence
so
heroically
visionary
the
don

of

it
was
not
only
in

that
life
to
him
was
the

and
the

the

he
lived

enduring
what

called

with
contempt
whenever
for
a
moment
he
becomes
conscious
of
it
the
basis
of
the
character
of
villiers
was
pride
and
it
was
pride
which
covered
more
than
the

and
this
pride
first
of
all
was
the

henceforth
the
order

for
villiers
to
whom
time
after
all
was
but
a
metaphysical
abstraction
the
age
of
the
crusaders
had
not
passed
from
a
descendant
of
the
grand
master
of
the
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
the
nineteenth
century
demanded
precisely
the
virtues
which
the
sixteenth
century
had
demanded
of
that
ancestor
and
these
virtues
were
all
summed
up
in
one
word
which
in
its
double
significance
single
to
him
covered
the
whole
attitude
of
life
the
word
nobility
no
word
returns
oftener
to
the
lips
in
speaking
of
what
is
most
characteristic
in
his
work
and
to
villiers
moral
and
spiritual
nobility
seemed
but
the
inevitable
consequence
of
that
other
kind
of
nobility
by
which
he
seemed
to
himself
still
a
knight
of
the
order
of
john
of
jerusalem
it
was
his
birthright
to
the
aristocratic
conception
of
things
nobility
of
soul
is
indeed
a
birthright
and
the
pride
with
which
this
gift
of
nature
is
accepted
is
a
pride
of
exactly
the
opposite
kind
to
that
democratic
pride
to
which
nobility
of
soul
is
a
conquest
valuable
in
proportion
to
its
difficulty
this
duality
always
essentially
aristocratic
and
democratic
typically
eastern
and
western
also
finds
its
place
in
every
theory
of
religion
philosophy
and
the
ideal
life
the
pride
of
the
pride
of
these
are
the
two
ultimate
contradictions
set
before
every
idealist
villiers
choice
inevitable
indeed
was
significant
in
this
measure
it
must
always
be
the
choice
of
the
artist
to
whom
in
his
contemplation
of
life
the
means
is
often
so
much
more
important
than
the
end
that
nobility
of
soul
which
comes
without
effort
which
comes
only
with
an
unrelaxed
diligence
over
oneself
that
i
should
be
i
there
can
at
least
be
no
comparison
of
its
beauty
with
the
stained
and
dusty
onslaught
on
a
never
quite
conquered
fort
of
the
enemy
in
a
divided
self
and
if
it
be
permitted
to
choose
among
degrees
of
sanctity
that
surely
is
the
highest
in
which
a
natural
genius
for
such
things
accepts
its
own
attainment
with
the
simplicity
of
a
birthright
and
the
catholicism
of
villiers
was
also
a
part
of
his
inheritance
his
ancestors
had
fought
for
the
church
and
catholicism
was
still
a
pompous
flag
under
which
it
was
possible
to
fight
on
behalf
of
the
spirit
against
that
materialism
which
is
always
in
one
way
or
another
atheist
thus
he
dedicates
one
of
his
stories
to
the
pope
chooses
ecclesiastical
splendours
by
preference
among
the
many
splendours
of
the
world
which
go
to
make
up
his
and
is
learned
in
the
subtleties
of
the
fathers
the
church
is
his
favourite
symbol
of
austere
intellectual
beauty
one
way
certainly
by
which
the
temptations
of
external
matter
may
be
vanquished
and
a
way
also
by
which
the
desire
of
worship
may
be
satisfied
but
there
was
also
in
his
attitude
towards
the
mysteries
of
the
spiritual
world
that
forbidden
curiosity
which
had
troubled
the
obedience
of
the
templars
and
which
came
to
him
too
as
a
kind
of
knightly
quality
whether
or
not
he
was
actually
a
cabbalist
questions
of
magic
began
at
an
early
age
to
preoccupy
him
and
from
the
first
wild
experiment
of
to
the
deliberate
summing
up
of
the
occult
world
finds
its
way
into
most
of
his
pages
fundamentally
the
belief
of
villiers
is
the
belief
common
to
all
eastern
mystics
know
once
for
all
that
there
is
for
thee
no
other
universe
than
that
conception
thereof
which
is
reflected
at
the
bottom
of
thy
thoughts
what
is
knowledge
but
a
recognition
therefore
forgetting
for
ever
that
which
was
the
illusion
of
thyself
hasten
to
become
an
intelligence
freed
from
the
bonds
and
the
desires
of
the
present
moment
become
the
flower
of
thyself
thou
art
but
what
thou
thinkest
therefore
think
thyself
eternal
man
if
thou
cease
to
limit
in
thyself
a
thing
that
is
to
desire
it
if
so
doing
thou
withdraw
thyself
from
it
it
will
follow
thee
as
the
water
fills
the
place
that
is
offered
to
it
in
the
hollow
of
the
hand
for
thou
possessest
the
real
being
of
all
things
in
thy
pure
will
and
thou
art
the
god
that
thou
art
able
to
become
to
have
accepted
the
doctrine
which
thus
finds
expression
in
is
to
have
accepted
this
among
others
of
its
consequences

chimeras

on
the

terms
as
the

the
oldest
of
them
are

in
there
is
a
fragment
of
conversation
between
two
young
students

has
its
significance

far
as
science
is
materialistic
and
his
passionate
curiosity
in
that

one
and
the

impulse
of
a

to
which
only

that
illusion
which

must
be
the
whole
effort
of
one
consciousness
to
escape
from
its
entanglements
to
dominate
it
or
to
ignore
it
and
one
art
must
be
the
building
of
an
ideal
world
beyond
its

from
which
one
may
indeed
sally
out
now

again
in
a
desperate
enough
attack
upon
the
illusions
in
the
midst
of
which
men
live
and
just
that
we
find
makes
up
the
work
of
villiers
work
which
divides
itself
roughly
into
two
divisions

the

the
originality

that

more
the
idealist

at

should
define

a
kind

the

as
exclusively
as
if
it
were
written
in
verse
the
modern
drama
under
the
democratic
influence
of
ibsen
the
positive
influence
of
dumas
has
limited
itself
to
the
expression
of
temperaments
in
the
one
case
of
theoretic
intelligences
in
the
other
in
as
nearly
as
possible
the
words
which
the
average
man
would
use
for
the
statement
of
his
emotions
and
ideas
the
form
that
is
is
degraded
below
the
level
of
the
characters
whom
it
attempts
to
express
for
it
is
evident
that
the
average
man
can
articulate
only
a
small
enough
part
of
what
he
obscurely
feels
or
thinks
and
the
theory
of
realism
is
that
his
emotions
and
ideas
are
to
be
given
only
in
so
far
as
the
words
at
his
own
command
can
give
them
villiers
choosing
to
concern
himself
only
with
exceptional
characters
and
with
them
only
in
the
absolute
invents
for
them
a
more
elaborate
and
a
more
magnificent
speech
than
they
would
naturally
employ
the
speech
of
their
thoughts
of
their
dreams
and
it
is
a
world
thought
or
dreamt
in
some
more
fortunate
atmosphere
than
that
in
which
we
live
that
villiers
has
created
for
the
final
achievement
of
his
abstract
ideas
i
do
not
doubt
that
he
himself
always
lived
in
it
through
all
the
poverty
of
the
precipitous
rue
des
martyrs
but
it
is
in
and
in
only
that
he
has
made
us
also
inhabitants
of
that
world
even
in
we
are
spectators
watching
a
tragical
fairy
play
as
if
became
suddenly
in
deadly
earnest
watching
some
one
else
dreams
envelops
us
in
its
own
atmosphere
it
is
as
if
we
found
ourselves
on
a
mountain
top
on
the
other
side
of
the
clouds
and
without
surprise
at
finding
ourselves
there
the
ideal
to
villiers
being
the
real
spiritual
beauty
being
the
essential
beauty
and
material
beauty
its
reflection
or
its
revelation
it
is
with
a
sort
of
fury
that
he
attacks
the
materialising
forces
of
the
world
science
progress
the
worldly
emphasis
on
facts
on
what
is
positive
serious
respectable
satire
with
him
is
the
revenge
of
beauty
upon
ugliness
the
persecution
of
the
ugly
it
is
not
merely
social
satire
it
is
a
satire
on
the
material
universe
by
one
who
believes
in
a
spiritual
universe
thus
it
is
the
only
laughter
of
our
time
which
is
fundamental
as
fundamental
as
that
of
swift
or
rabelais
and
this
lacerating
laughter
of
the
idealist
is
never
surer
in
its
aim
than
when
it
turns
the
arms
of
science
against
itself
as
in
the
vast
buffoonery
of
a
parisian
wit
sharpened
to
a
fineness
of
irony
such
as
only
wit
which
is
also
philosophy
can
attain
brings
in
another
method
of
attack
humour
which
is
almost
english
another
while
again
satire
becomes
tragic
fantastic
macabre
in
those
enigmatic
tales
of
the
grotesque
and
arabesque
in
which
villiers
rivals
poe
on
his
own
ground
there
is
for
the
most
part
a
multiplicity
of
meaning
which
is
as
it
is
meant
to
be
disconcerting
i
should
not
like
to
say
how
far
villiers
does
not
sometimes
believe
in
his
own
magic
it
is
characteristic
of
him
at
all
events
that
he
employs
what
we
call
the
supernatural
alike
in
his
works
of
pure
idealism
and
in
his
works
of
sheer
satire
the
moment
the
world
ceased
to
be
the
stable
object
solidly
encrusted
with
houses
in
brick
and
stone
which
it
is
to
most
of
its
so
temporary
inhabitants
villiers
was
at
home
when
he
sought
the
absolute
beauty
it
was
beyond
the
world
that
he
found
it
when
he
sought
horror
it
was
a
breath
blowing
from
an
invisible
darkness
which
brought
it
to
his
nerves
when
he
desired
to
mock
the
pretensions
of
knowledge
of
or
ignorance
it
was
always
with
the
unseen
that
his
tragic
buffoonery
made
familiar
there
is
in
everything
which
villiers
wrote
a
strangeness
certainly
both
instinctive
and
deliberate
which
seems
to
me
to
be
the
natural
consequence
of
that
intellectual
pride
which
as
i
have
pointed
out
was
at
the
basis
of
his
character
he
hated
every
kind
of
mediocrity
therefore
he
chose
to
analyse
exceptional
souls
to
construct
exceptional
stories
to
invent
splendid
names
and
to
evoke
singular
landscapes
it
was
part
of
his
curiosity
in
souls
to
prefer
the
complex
to
the
simple
the
perverse
to
the
straightforward
the
ambiguous
to
either
his
heroes
are
incarnations
of
spiritual
pride
and
their
tragedies
are
the
shock
of
spirit
against
matter
the
invasion
of
spirit
by
matter
the
temptation
of
spirit
by
spiritual
evil
they
seek
the
absolute
and
find
death
they
seek
wisdom
find
love
and
fall
into
spiritual
decay
they
seek
reality
and
find
crime
they
seek
phantoms
and
find
themselves
they
are
on
the
borders
of
a
wisdom
too
great
for
their
capacity
they
are
haunted
by
dark
powers
instincts
of
ambiguous
passions
they
are
too
lucid
to
be
quite
sane
in
their
extravagances
they
have
not
quite
systematically
transposed
their
dreams
into
actions
and
his
heroines
when
they
are
not
like
future
the
vitalised
mechanism
of
an
edison
have
the
solemnity
of
dead
people
and
a
hieratic
speech
des
cœurs
condamnés
à
ce
supplice
de
ne
pas
says
sara
in
je
ne
pas
ce
jeune
homme
donc
fait
à
dieu
says
elën
and
their
voice
is
always
like
the
voice
of
elën
i
listened
attentively
to
the
sound
of
her
voice
it
was
tactiturn
subdued
like
the
murmur
of
the
river
lethe
flowing
through
the
region
of
shadows
they
have
the
immortal
weariness
of
beauty
they
are
enigmas
to
themselves
they
desire
and
know
not
why
they
refrain
they
do
good
and
evil
with
the
lifting
of
an
eyelid
and
are
innocent
and
guilty
of
all
the
sins
of
the
earth
and
these
strange
inhabitants
move
in
as
strange
a
world
they
are
the
princes
and
châtelaines
of
ancient
castles
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
black
forest
they
are
the
last
descendants
of
a
great
race
about
to
come
to
an
end
students
of
magic
who
have
the
sharp
and
swift
swords
of
the
soldier
enigmatic
courtesans
at
the
table
of
strange
feasts
they
find
incalculable
treasures
et
sonnantes
cataractes
liquide
only
to
disdain
them
all
the
pomp
of
the
world
approaches
them
that
they
may
the
better
abnegate
it
or
that
it
may
ruin
them
to
a
deeper
degree
of
their
material
hell
and
we
see
them
always
at
the
moment
of
a
crisis
before
the
two
ways
of
a
decision
hesitating
in
the
entanglements
of
a
great
temptation
and
this
casuist
of
souls
will
drag
forth
some
horribly
stunted
or
horribly
overgrown
soul
from
under
its
obscure
covering
setting
it
to
dance
naked
before
our
eyes
he
has
no
mercy
on
those
who
have
no
mercy
on
themselves
in
the
sense
in
which
that
word
is
ordinarily
used
villiers
has
no
pathos
this
is
enough
to
explain
why
he
can
never
in
the
phrase
he
would
have
disliked
so
greatly
touch
the
popular
heart
his
mind
is
too
abstract
to
contain
pity
and
it
is
in
his
lack
of
pity
that
he
seems
to
put
himself
outside
humanity
chacun
son
infini
he
has
said
and
in
the
avidity
of
his
search
for
the
infinite
he
has
no
mercy
for
the
blind
weakness
which
goes
stumbling
over
the
earth
without
so
much
as
knowing
that
the
sun
and
stars
are
overhead
he
sees
only
the
gross
multitude
the
multitude
which
has
the
contentment
of
the
slave
he
can
not
pardon
stupidity
for
it
is
incomprehensible
to
him
he
sees
rightly
that
stupidity
is
more
criminal
than
vice
if
only
because
vice
is
curable
stupidity
incurable
but
he
does
not
realise
as
the
great
novelists
have
realised
that
stupidity
can
be
pathetic
and
that
there
is
not
a
peasant
nor
even
a
bourgeois
in
whom
the
soul
has
not
its
part
in
whose
existence
it
is
not
possible
to
be
interested
contempt
noble
as
it
may
be
anger
righteous
though
it
may
be
can
not
be
indulged
in
without
a
certain
lack
of
sympathy
and
lack
of
sympathy
comes
from
a
lack
of
patient
understanding
it
is
certain
that
the
destiny
of
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
is
either
infinitely
pathetic
or
infinitely
ridiculous
under
which
aspect
then
shall
that
destiny
and
those
obscure
fractions
of
humanity
be
considered
villiers
was
too
sincere
an
idealist
too
absolute
in
his
idealism
to
hesitate
as
for
living
he
cries
in
that
splendid
phrase
of
our
servants
will
do
that
for
us
and
in
the
cruels
there
is
this
not
less
characteristic
expression
of
what
was
always
his
mental
attitude
as
at
the
play
in
a
central
stall
one
sits
out
so
as
not
to
disturb
one
neighbours
out
of
courtesy
in
a
word
some
play
written
in
a
wearisome
style
and
of
which
one
does
not
like
the
subject
so
i
lived
out
of
politeness
vivais
par
in
this
haughtiness
towards
life
in
this
disdain
of
ordinary
human
motives
and
ordinary
human
beings
there
is
at
once
the
distinction
and
the
weakness
of
villiers
and
he
has
himself
pointed
the
moral
against
himself
in
these
words
of
the
story
which
forms
the
epilogue
to
the
cruels
when
the
forehead
alone
contains
the
existence
of
a
man
that
man
is
enlightened
only
from
above
his
head
then
his
jealous
shadow
prostrate
under
him
draws
him
by
the
feet
that
it
may
drag
him
down
into
the
invisible
all
his
life
villiers
was
a
poor
man
though
all
his
life
he
was
awaiting
that
fortune
which
he
refused
to
anticipate
by
any
mean
employment
during
most
of
his
life
he
was
practically
an
unknown
man
greatly
loved
ardently
admired
by
that
inner
circle
of
the
men
who
have
made
modern
french
literature
from
verlaine
to
maeterlinck
he
was
looked
upon
by
most
people
as
an
amusing
kind
of
madman
a
little
dangerous
whose
ideas
as
they
floated
freely
over
the
it
was
at
times
highly
profitable
to
steal
for
villiers
talked
his
works
before
writing
them
and
sometimes
he
talked
them
instead
of
writing
them
in
his
too
royally
spendthrift
way
to
those
who
knew
him
he
seemed
genius
itself
and
would
have
seemed
so
if
he
had
never
written
a
line
for
he
had
the
dangerous
gift
of
a
personality
which
seems
to
have
already
achieved
all
that
it
so
energetically
contemplates
but
personality
tells
only
within
hands
reach
and
villiers
failed
even
to
startle
failed
even
to
exasperate
the
general
reader
that
his
poésies
published
at
i
the
age
of
nineteen
should
have
brought
him
fame
was
hardly
to
be
expected
remarkable
especially
in
its
ideas
as
that
book
is
nor
was
it
to
be
expected
of
the
enigmatic
fragment
of
a
romance
anticipating
as
it
does
by
so
long
a
period
the
esoteric
and
spiritualistic
romances
which
were
to
have
their
vogue
but
and
those
two
poetic
dramas
in
prose
so
full
of
distinction
of
spiritual
rarity
but
two
years
later
afterwards
incorporated
in
one
of
his
really
great
books
with
its
macabre
horror
but
for
villiers
so
actual
and
which
had
its
moments
of
success
when
it
was
revived
in
at
the
odéon
but
nouveau
a
drama
which
by
some
extraordinary
caprice
won
a
prize
but
contes
that
collection
of
masterpieces
in
which
the
essentially
french
is
outdone
on
its
own
ground
it
was
not
till
that
villiers
ceased
to
be
an
unknown
writer
with
the
publication
of
that
phosphorescent
buffoonery
of
science
that
vast
parody
of
humanity
future
tribulat
which
he
himself
denned
as
énorme
et
sombre

was
to
come
in
its
final
form
and
the
superb
poem
in
prose
and
then
more
and
more
indifferent
collections
of
stories
in
which
villiers
already
dying
is
but
the
shadow
of
himself
contes
he
was
correcting
the
proofs
of
when
he
died
the
volume
was
published
in
followed
by
and
a
series
of
articles
les
once
dead
the
fame
which
had
avoided
him
all
his
life
began
to
follow
him
he
had
belle
at
his
funeral
meanwhile
he
had
been
preparing
the
spiritual
atmosphere
of
the
new
generation
living
among
believers
in
the
material
world
he
had
been
declaring
not
in
vain
his
belief
in
the
world
of
the
spirit
living
among
realists
and
parnassians
he
had
been
creating
a
new
form
of
art
the
art
of
the
symbolist
drama
and
of
symbolism
in
fiction
he
had
been
lonely
all
his
life
for
he
had
been
living
in
his
own
lifetime
the
life
of
the
next
generation
there
was
but
one
man
among
his
contemporaries
to
whom
he
could
give
and
from
whom
he
could
receive
perfect
sympathy
that
man
was
wagner
gradually
the
younger
men
came
about
him
at
the
end
he
was
not
lacking
in
disciples
and
after
all
the
last
word
of
villiers
is
faith
faith
against
the
evidence
of
the
senses
against
the
negations
of
materialistic
science
against
the
monstrous
paradox
of
progress
against
his
own
pessimism
in
the
face
of
these
formidable
enemies
he
affirms
he
believes
in
soul
is
very
sure
of
god
requires
no
witness
to
the
spiritual
world
of
which
he
is
always
the
inhabitant
and
is
content
to
lose
his
way
in
the
material
world
brushing
off
its
mud
from
time
to
time
with
a
disdainful
gesture
as
he
goes
on
his
way
to
apply
a
significant
word
of
pater
like
one
on
a
secret
errand
léon
cladel
i
hope
that
the
life
of
léon
cladel
by
his
daughter
judith
which
lemerre
has
brought
out
in
a
pleasant
volume
will
do
something
for
the
fame
of
one
of
the
most
original
writers
of
our
time
cladel
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
recognised
in
his
lifetime
by
those
whose
approval
mattered
most
beginning
with
baudelaire
who
discovered
him
before
he
had
printed
his
first
book
and
helped
to
teach
him
the
craft
of
letters
but
so
exceptional
an
artist
could
never
be
popular
though
he
worked
in
living
stuff
and
put
the
whole
savour
of
his
countryside
into
his
tragic
and
passionate
stories
a
peasant
who
writes
about
peasants
and
poor
people
with
a
curiosity
of
style
which
not
only
packs
his
vocabulary
with
difficult
words
old
or
local
and
with
unheard
of
rhythms
chosen
to
give
voice
to
some
never
yet
articulated
emotion
but
which
drives
him
into
oddities
of
printing
of
punctuation
of
the
very
shape
of
his
accents
a
page
of
cladel
has
a
certain
visible
uncouthness
and
at
first
this
seems
in
keeping
with
his
matter
but
the
uncouthness
when
you
look
into
it
turns
out
to
be
itself
a
refinement
and
what
has
seemed
a
confused
whirl
an
improvisation
to
be
the
result
really
of
reiterated
labour
whose
whole
aim
has
been
to
bring
the
spontaneity
of
the
first
impulse
back
into
the
laboriously
finished
work
in
this
just
sensitive
and
admirable
book
written
by
one
who
has
inherited
a
not
less
passionate
curiosity
about
life
but
with
more
patience
in
waiting
upon
it
watching
it
noting
its
surprises
we
have
a
simple
and
sufficient
commentary
upon
the
books
and
upon
the
man
the
narrative
has
warmth
and
reserve
and
is
at
once
tender
and
nettement

i
can
remember
how
mysterious
and
alluring
they
used
to
seem
to
me
when
i
first
saw
them
on
the
cover
of
what
was
perhaps
his
best
book
it
is
by
one
of
the
stories
and
the
shortest
in
that
i
remember
cladel
i
read
it
when
i
was
a
boy
and
i
can
not
think
of
it
now
without
a
shiver
it
is
called
and
it
is
about
a
sandow
of
the
streets
a
professional
strong
man
who
kills
himself
by
an
overstrain
it
is
not
a
story
at
all
it
is
the
record
of
an
incident
and
there
is
only
the
strong
man
in
it
and
his
friend
the
zany
who
makes
the
jokes
while
the
strong
man
juggles
with
bars
and
it
is
all
told
in
a
breath
without
a
pause
as
if
someone
who
had
just
seen
it
poured
it
out
in
a
flood
of
hot
words
such
vehemence
such
pity
such
a
sense
of
the
cruelty
of
the
spectacle
of
a
man
driven
to
death
like
a
beast
for
a
few
pence
and
the
pleasure
of
a
few
children
such
an
evocation
of
the
sun
and
the
streets
and
this
sordid
tragic
thing
happening
to
the
sound
of
drum
and
cymbals
such
a
vision
in
sunlight
of
a
barbarous
and
ridiculous
and
horrible
accident
lifted
by
the
telling
of
it
into
a
new
and
unforgettable
beauty
i
have
never
felt
or
seen
in
any
other
story
of
a
like
grotesque
tragedy
it
realises
an
ideal
it
does
for
once
what
many
artists
have
tried
and
failed
to
do
it
wrings
the
last
drop
of
agony
out
of
that
subject
which
it
is
so
easy
to
make
pathetic
and
effective
dickens
could
not
have
done
it
bret
harte
could
not
have
done
it
kipling
could
not
do
it
cladel
did
it
only
once
with
this
perfection
something
like
it
he
did
over
and
over
again
with
unflagging
vehemence
with
splendid
variations
in
stories
of
peasants
and
wrestlers
and
thieves
and
prostitutes
they
are
all
as
his
daughter
says
epic
she
calls
them
homeric
but
there
is
none
of
the
homeric
simplicity
in
this
tumult
of
coloured
and
clotted
speech
in
which
the
language
is
tortured
to
make
it
speak
the

with

maxim

makes
heroes

them
consciously
with

giving

ideas
which
he
has
found
in
nietzsche
cladel
put
into
all
his
people
some
of
his
own
passionate
way
of
seeing
scarlet
to
use
barbey
epithet
rural
vehement
and
voluminous
he
overflowed
his
whole
aim
as
an
artist
as
a
pupil
of
baudelaire
was
to
concentrate
to
hold
himself
back
and
the
effort
added
impetus
to
the
checked
overflow
to
the
realists
he
seemed
merely
extravagant
he
saw
certainly
what
they
could
not
see
and
his
romance
was
always
a
fruit
of
the
soil
the
artist
in
him
seeming
to
be
in
conflict
with
the
peasant
fortified
clarified
the
peasant
extracted
from
that
hard
soil
a
rare
fruit
you
see
in
his
face
an
extraordinary
mingling
of
the
peasant
the
visionary
and
the
dandy
the
long
hair
and
beard
the
sensitive
mouth
and
nose
the
fierce
brooding
eyes
in
which
wildness
and
delicacy
strength
and
a
kind
of
stealthiness
seem
to
be
grafted
on
an
inflexible
peasant
stock
a
note
on
zola
method
the
art
of
zola
is
based
on
certain
theories
on
a
view
of
humanity
which
he
has
adopted
as
his
formula
as
a
deduction
from
his
formula
he
takes
many
things
in
human
nature
for
granted
he
is
content
to
observe
at
and
it
is
only
when
he
comes
to
the
of
his
outlines
the
that
his
observation
becomes
personal
minute
and
persistent
he
has
thus
succeeded
in
being
at
once
unreal
where
reality
is
most
essential
and
tediously
real
where
a
reality
is
sometimes
unimportant
the
contradiction
is
an
ingenious
one
which
it
may
be
interesting
to
examine
in
a
little
detail
and
from
several
points
of
view
and
first
of
all
take
no
doubt
the
most
characteristic
of
zola
novels
and
probably
the
best
and
leaving
out
for
the
present
the
broader
question
of
his
general
conception
of
humanity
let
us
look
at
zola
manner
of
dealing
with
his
material
noting
by
the
way
certain
differences
between
his
manner
and
that
of
goncourt
of
flaubert
with
both
of
whom
he
has
so
often
been
compared
and
with
whom
he
wishes
to
challenge
comparison
contrast
with
lacerteux
which
it
must
be
remembered
was
written
thirteen
years
earlier
goncourt
as
he
incessantly
reminds
us
was
the
first
novelist
in
france
to
deliberately
study
the
life
of
the
people
after
precise
documents
and
has
this
distinction
among
others
that
it
was
a
new
thing
and
it
is
done
with
admirable
skill
i
as
a
piece
of
writing
as
a
work
of
art
it
is
far
superior
to
zola
but
certainly
zola
work
has
a
mass
and
bulk
a
a
which
goncourt
lacks
and
it
has
a
savour
of
plebeian
flesh
which
all
the
delicate
art
of
goncourt
could
not
evoke
zola
sickens
you
with
it
but
there
it
is
as
in
all
his
books
but
more
than
in
most
there
is
something
greasy
a
smear
of
eating
and
drinking
the
pages
to
use
his
own
phrase
des
lichades
du
in
you
never
forget
that
goncourt
is
an
aristocrat
in
you
never
forget
that
zola
is
a
bourgeois
whatever
goncourt
touches
becomes
by
the
mere
magic
of
his
touch
charming
a
picture
zola
is
totally
destitute
of
charm
but
how
in
he
drives
home
to
you
the
horrid
realities
of
these
narrow
uncomfortable
lives
zola
has
made
up
his
mind
that
he
will
say
everything
without
omitting
a
single
item
whatever
he
has
to
say
thus
in
there
is
a
great
feast
which
lasts
for
fifty
pages
beginning
with
the
picking
of
the
goose
the
day
before
and
going
on
to
the
picking
of
the
goose
bones
by
a
stray
marauding
cat
the
night
after
and
in
a
sense
he
does
say
everything
and
there
certainly
is
his
novelty
his
invention
he
observes
with
immense
persistence
but
his
observation
after
all
is
only
that
of
the
man
in
the
street
it
is
simply
carried
into
detail
deliberately
and
while
goncourt
wanders
away
sometimes
into
arabesques
indulges
in
flourishes
so
finely
artistic
is
his
sense
of
words
and
of
the
things
they
represent
so
perfectly
can
he
match
a
sensation
or
an
impression
by
its
figure
in
speech
zola
on
the
contrary
never
finds
just
the
right
word
and
it
is
his
persistent
fumbling
for
it
which
produces
these
miles
of
description
four
pages
describing
how
two
people
went
upstairs
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
sixth
story
and
then
two
pages
afterwards
to
describe
how
they
came
downstairs
again
sometimes
by
his
prodigious
diligence
and
minuteness
he
succeeds
in
giving
you
the
impression
often
indeed
but
at
the
cost
of
what
to
writer
and
reader
alike
and
so
much
of
it
all
is
purely
unnecessary
has
no
interest
in
itself
and
no
connection
with
the
story
the
precise
details
of
lorilleux
bristling
with
technical
terms
it
was
that
he
made
and
only
that
particular
kind
of
chain
goujet
forge
and
the
machinery
in
the
shed
next
door
and
just
how
you
cut
out
zinc
with
a
large
pair
of
scissors
when
goncourt
gives
you
a
long
description
of
anything
even
if
you
do
not
feel
that
it
helps
on
the
story
very
much
it
is
such
a
beautiful
thing
in
itself
his
mere
way
of
writing
it
is
so
enchanting
that
you
find
yourself
wishing
it
longer
at
its
longest
but
with
zola
there
is
no
literary
interest
in
the
writing
apart
from
its
clear
and
coherent
expression
of
a
given
thing
and
these
interminable
descriptions
have
no
extraneous
or
if
you
will
implicit
interest
to
save
them
from
the
charge
of
irrelevancy
they
sink
by
their
own
weight
just
as
zola
vision
is
the
vision
of
the
average
man
so
his
vocabulary
with
all
its
technicology
remains
mediocre
incapable
of
expressing
subtleties
incapable
of
a
really
artistic
effect
to
find
out
in
a
slang
dictionary
that
a
filthy
idea
can
be
expressed
by
an
ingeniously
filthy
phrase
in
and
to
use
that
phrase
is
not
a
great
feat
or
on
purely
artistic
grounds
altogether
desirable
to
go
to
a
chainmaker
and
learn
the
trade
name
of
the
various
kinds
of
chain
which
he
manufactures
and
of
the
instruments
with
which
he
manufactures
them
is
not
an
elaborate
process
or
one
which
can
be
said
to
pay
you
for
the
little
trouble
which
it
no
doubt
takes
and
it
is
not
well
to
be
too
cerïain
after
all
that
zola
is
always
perfectly
accurate
in
his
use
of
all
this
manifold
knowledge
the
slang
for
example
he
went
to
books
for
it
in
books
he
found
it
and
no
one
will
ever
find
some
of
it
but
in
books
however
my
main
contention
is
that
zola
general
use
of
words
is
to
be
quite
frank
somewhat
ineffectual
he
tries
to
do
what
flaubert
did
without
flaubert
tools
and
without
the
craftsman
hand
at
the
back
of
the
tools
his
fingers
are
too
thick
they
leave
a
blurred
line
if
you
want
merely
weight
a
certain
kind
of
force
you
get
it
but
no
more
where
a
large
part
of
zola
merit
lies
in
his
persistent
attention
to
detail
one
finds
also
one
of
his
chief
defects
he
can
not
leave
well
alone
he
can
not
omit
he
will
not
take
the
most
obvious
fact
for
granted
marcha
le
premier
elle
le
suivit
well
of
course
she
followed
him
if
he
walked
first
why
mention
the
fact
that
beginning
of
a
sentence
is
absolutely
typical
it
is
impossible
for
him
to
refer
for
the
twentieth
time
to
some
unimportant
character
without
giving
name
and
profession
not
one
or
the
other
but
both
invariably
both
he
tells
us
particularly
that
a
room
is
composed
of
four
walls
that
a
table
stands
on
its
four
legs
and
he
does
not
appear
to
see
the
difference
between
doing
that
and
doing
as
flaubert
does
namely
selecting
precisely
the
detail
out
of
all
others
which
renders
or
consorts
with
the
scene
in
hand
and
giving
that
detail
with
an
ingenious
exactness
here
for
instance
in
bovary
is
a
characteristic
detail
in
the
manner
of
flaubert
jours
après
comme
elle
étendait
du
linge
dans
sa
cour
elle
fut
prise
crachement
de
sang
et
le
lendemain
tandis
que
charles
avait
le
dos
tourné
pour
fermer
le
rideau
de
la
fenêtre
elle
dit
ah
mon
dieu
poussa
un
soupir
et
elle
était
now
that
detail
brought
in
without
the
slightest
emphasis
of
the
husband
turning
his
back
at
the
very
instant
that
his
wife
dies
is
a
detail
of
immense
psychological
value
it
indicates
to
us
at
the
very
opening
of
the
book
just
the
character
of
the
man
about
whom
we
are
to
read
so
much
zola
would
have
taken
at
least
two
pages
to
say
that
and
after
all
he
would
not
have
said
it
he
would
have
told
you
the
position
of
the
chest
of
drawers
in
the
room
what
wood
the
chest
of
drawers
was
made
of
and
if
it
had
a
little
varnish
knocked
off
at
the
corner
of
the
lower
cornice
just
where
it
would
naturally
be
in
the
way
of
feet
as
they
entered
the
door
he
would
have
told
you
how
charles
leant
against
the
other
corner
of
the
chest
of
drawers
and
that
the
edge
of
the
upper
cornice
left
a
slight
dent
in
his
black
which
remained
visible
half
an
hour
afterwards
but
that
one
little
detail
which
flaubert
selects
from
among
a
thousand
that
no
he
would
never
have
given
us
that
and
the
language
in
which
all
this
is
written
apart
from
the
consideration
of
language
as
a
medium
is
really
not
literature
at
all
in
any
strict
sense
i
am
not
for
the
moment
complaining
of
the
colloquialism
and
the
slang
zola
has
told
us
that
he
has
in
used
the
language
of
the
people
in
order
to
render
the
people
with
a
closer
truth
whether
he
has
done
that
or
not
is
not
the
question
the
question
is
that
he
does
not
give
one
the
sense
of
reading
good
literature
whether
he
speaks
in
delvau
verte
or
according
to
the
academy
latest
edition
of
classical
french
his
sentences
have
no
rhythm
they
give
no
pleasure
to
the
ear
they
carry
no
sensation
to
the
eye
you
hear
a
sentence
of
flaubert
and
you
see
a
sentence
of
goncourt
like
living
things
with
forms
and
voices
but
a
page
of
zola
lies
dull
and
silent
before
you
it
draws
you
by
no
charm
it
has
no
meaning
until
you
have
read
the
page
that
goes
before
and
the
page
that
comes
after
it
is
like
work
solid
well
fitted
together
and
essentially
made
to
be
used
yes
there
is
no
doubt
that
zola
writes
very
badly
worse
than
any
other
french
writer
of
eminence
it
is
true
that
balzac
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
does
in
a
sense
write
badly
but
his
way
of
writing
badly
is
very
different
from
zola
and
leaves
you
with
the
sense
of
quite
a
different
result
balzac
is
too
impatient
with
words
he
can
not
stay
to
get
them
all
into
proper
order
to
pick
and
choose
among
them
night
the
coffee
the
wet
towel
and
the
end
of
six
hours
labour
are
often
too
much
for
him
and
his
manner
of
writing
his
novels
on
the
altering
and
expanding
as
fresh
ideas
came
to
him
on
each
was
not
a
way
of
doing
things
which
can
possibly
result
in
perfect
writing
but
balzac
sins
from
excess
from
a
feverish
haste
the
very
extravagance
of
power
and
at
all
events
he
sins
strongly
zola
sins
meanly
he
is
penuriously
careful
he
does
the
best
he
possibly
can
and
he
is
not
aware
that
his
best
does
not
answer
all
requirements
so
long
as
writing
is
clear
and
not
ungrammatical
it
seems
to
him
sufficient
he
has
not
realised
that
without
charm
there
can
be
no
fine
literature
as
there
can
be
no
perfect
flower
without
fragrance
and
it
is
here
that
i
would
complain
not
as
a
matter
of
morals
but
as
a
matter
of
art
of
zola
obsession
by
what
is
grossly
uninterestingly
filthy
there
is
a
certain
simile
in
used
in
the
most
innocent
connection
in
connection
with
a
bonnet
which
seems
to
me
the
most
abjectly
dirty
phrase
which
i
have
ever
read
it
is
one
thing
to
use
dirty
words
to
describe
dirty
things
that
may
be
necessary
and
thus
unexceptionable
it
is
another
thing
again
and
this
too
may
well
be
defended
on
artistic
grounds
to
be
ingeniously
and
wittily
indecent
but
i
do
not
think
a
real
man
of
letters
could
possibly
have
used
such
an
expression
as
the
one
i
am
alluding
to
or
could
so
meanly
succumb
to
certain
kinds
of
prurience
which
we
find
in
zola
work
such
a
scene
as
the
one
in
which
gervaise
comes
home
with
lantier
and
finds
per
husband
lying
drunk
asleep
in
his
own
vomit
might
certainly
be
explained
and
even
excused
though
few
more
disagreeable
things
were
ever
written
on
the
ground
of
the
psychological
importance
which
it
undoubtedly
has
and
the
overwhelming
way
in
which
it
drives
home
the
point
which
it
is
the
writer
business
to
make
but
the
worrying
way
in
which
and
are
constantly
kept
in
view
without
the
slightest
necessity
is
quite
another
thing
i
should
not
like
to
say
how
often
the
phrase
sa
nudité
de
jolie
fille
occurs
in
zola
zola
nudities
always
remind
me
of
those
which
you
can
see
in
the
au
pain
at
vincennes
by
paying
a
penny
and
looking
through
a
in
the
laundry
scenes
for
instance
in
he
is
always
reminding
you
that
the
laundresses
have
turned
up
their
sleeves
or
undone
a
button
or
two
of
their
bodices
his
eyes
seem
eternally
fixed
on
the
inch
or
two
of
bare
flesh
that
can
be
seen
and
he
nudges
your
elbow
at
every
moment
to
make
sure
that
you
are
looking
too
nothing
may
be
more
charming
than
a
frankly
sensuous
description
of
things
which
appeal
to
the
senses
but
can
one
imagine
anything
less
charming
less
like
art
than
this
prying
eye
glued
to
the
in
the
gingerbread
fair
yet
whatever
view
may
be
taken
of
zola
work
in
literature
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
life
of
zola
is
a
model
lesson
and
might
profitably
be
told
in
one
of
dr
smiles
edifying
biographies
it
may
even
be
brought
as
a
reproach
against
the
writer
of
these
novels
in
which
there
are
so
many
offences
against
the
respectable
virtues
that
he
is
too
good
a
bourgeois
too
much
the
incarnation
of
the
respectable
virtues
to
be
a
man
of
genius
if
the
finest
art
comes
of
the
intensest
living
then
zola
has
never
had
even
a
chance
of
doing
the
greatest
kind
of
work
it
is
his
merit
and
his
misfortune
to
have
lived
entirely
in
and
for
his
books
with
a
heroic
devotion
to
his
ideal
of
literary
duty
which
would
merit
every
praise
if
we
had
to
consider
simply
the
moral
side
of
the
question
so
many
pages
of
copy
a
day
so
many
hours
of
study
given
to
mysticism
or
les
halles
zola
has
always
had
his
day
work
marked
out
before
him
and
he
has
never
swerved
from
it
a
recent
life
of
zola
tells
us
something
about
his
way
of
getting
up
a
subject
immense
preparation
had
been
necessary
for
the
de
mountains
of
were
heaped
up
on
his
table
and
for
months
zola
was
plunged
in
the
study
of
religious
works
all
the
mystical
part
of
the
book
and
notably
the
passages
having
reference
to
the
cultus
of
mary
was
taken
from
the
works
of
the
spanish
jesuits
the
of
jesus
was
largely
drawn
upon
many
passages
being
copied
almost
word
for
word
into
the
novel
much
as
in
harlowe
that
other
great
realist
richardson
copied
whole
passages
from
the
psalms
the
description
of
life
in
a
grand
seminary
was
given
him
by
a
priest
who
had
been
dismissed
from
ecclesiastical
service
the
little
church
of
sainte
marie
des
batignolles
was
regularly
visited
how
commendable
all
that
is
but
surely
how
futile
can
one
conceive
of
a
more
hopeless
a
more
ridiculous
task
than
that
of
setting
to
work
on
a
novel
of
ecclesiastical
life
as
if
one
were
cramming
for
an
examination
in
religious
knowledge
zola
apparently
imagines
that
he
can
master
mysticism
in
a
fortnight
as
he
masters
the
police
regulations
of
les
halles
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
does
wonders
with
his
information
alike
in
regard
to
mysticism
and
les
halles
but
he
succeeds
only
to
a
certain
point
and
that
point
lies
on
the
nearer
side
of
what
is
really
meant
by
success
is
not
zola
himself
at
his
moments
aware
of
this
a
letter
written
in
and
printed
in
sherard
life
of
zola
from
which
i
have
just
quoted
seems
to
me
very
significant
i
continue
to
work
in
a
good
state
of
mental
equilibrium
my
novel
is
certainly
only
a
task
requiring
precision
and
clearness
no
not
the
least
lyrical
treat
it
does
not
give
me
any
warm
satisfaction
but
it
amuses
me
like
a
piece
of
mechanism
with
a
thousand
wheels
of
which
it
is
my
duty
to
regulate
the
movements
with
the
most
minute
care
i
ask
myself
the
question
is
it
good
policy
when
one
feels
that
one
has
passion
in
one
to
check
it
or
even
to
bridle
it
if
one
of
my
books
is
destined
to
become
immortal
it
will
i
am
sure
be
the
most
passionate
one
en
marbre
ou
non
la
vénus
de
milo
said
the
parnassians
priding
themselves
on
their
muse
with
her
bien
zola
will
describe
to
you
the
exact
shape
and
the
exact
smell
of
the
rags
of
his
naturalistic
muse
but
has
she
under
the
tatters
really
a
human
heart
in
the
whole
of
zola
works
amid
all
his
exact
and
impressive
descriptions
of
misery
all
his
endless
annals
of
the
poor
i
know
only
one
episode
which
brings
tears
to
the
eyes
the
episode
of
the
lalie
in
a
piece
of
mechanism
with
a
thousand
wheels
that
is
indeed
the
image
of
this
immense
and
wonderful
study
of
human
life
evolved
out
of
the
brain
of
a
solitary
student
who
knows
life
only
by
the
report
of
his
documents
his
friends
and
above
all
his
formula
zola
has
denned
art
very
aptly
as
nature
seen
through
a
temperament
the
art
of
zola
is
nature
seen
through
a
formula
this
professed
realist
is
a
man
of
theories
who
studies
life
with
a
conviction
that
he
will
find
there
such
and
such
things
which
he
has
read
about
in
scientific
books
he
observes
indeed
with
astonishing
minuteness
but
he
observes
in
support
of
preconceived
ideas
and
so
powerful
is
his
imagination
that
he
has
created
a
whole
world
which
has
no
existence
anywhere
but
in
his
own
brain
and
he
has
placed
there
imaginary
beings
so
much
more
logical
than
life
in
the
midst
of
surroundings
which
are
themselves
so
real
as
to
lend
almost
a
semblance
of
reality
to
the
embodied
formulas
who
inhabit
them
it
is
the
boast
of
zola
that
he
has
taken
up
art
at
the
point
where
flaubert
left
it
and
that
he
has
developed
that
art
in
its
logical
sequence
but
the
art
of
flaubert
itself
a
development
from
balzac
had
carried
realism
if
not
in
bovary
at
all
events
in
sentimentale
as
far
as
realism
can
well
go
without
ceasing
to
be
art
in
the
grey
and
somewhat
sordid
history
of
frédéric
moreau
there
is
not
à
touch
of
romanticism
not
so
much
as
a
concession
to
style
a
momentary
escape
of
the
imprisoned
lyrical
tendency
everything
is
observed
everything
is
taken
straight
from
life
realism
sincere
direct
implacable
reigns
from
end
to
end
of
the
book
but
with
what
consummate
art
all
this
mass
of
observation
is
disintegrated
arranged
composed
with
what
infinite
delicacy
it
is
manipulated
in
the
service
of
an
unerring
sense
of
construction
and
flaubert
has
no
theory
has
no
prejudices
has
only
a
certain
impatience
with
human
imbecility
zola
too
gathers
his
documents
heaps
up
his
mass
of
observation
and
then
in
this
unhappy
development
of
the
principles
of
art
which
produced
sentimentale
flings
everything
into
one
overflowing
the
probabilities
of
nature
and
the
delicacies
of
art
are
alike
drowned
beneath
a
flood
of
turbid
observation
and
in
the
end
one
does
not
even
feel
convinced
that
zola
really
knows
his
subject
i
remember
once
hearing
huysmans
with
his
look
and
tone
of
subtle
ironical
malice
describe
how
zola
when
he
was
writing
terre
took
a
drive
into
the
country
in
a
victoria
to
see
the
peasants
the
english
papers
once
reported
an
interview
in
which
the
author
of
indiscreetly
questioned
as
to
the
amount
of
personal
observation
he
had
put
into
the
book
replied
that
he
had
lunched
with
an
actress
of
the
variétés
the
reply
was
generally
taken
for
a
joke
but
the
lunch
was
a
reality
and
it
was
assuredly
a
rare
experience
in
the
life
of
solitary
diligence
to
which
we
owe
so
many
impersonal
studies
in
life
nor
did
zola
as
he
sat
silent
by
the
side
of
mlle
seem
to
be
making
much
use
of
the
opportunity
the
language
of
the
miners
in
how
much
of
local
colour
is
there
in
that
the
interminable
additions
and
divisions
the
extracts
from
a
financial
gazette
in
how
much
of
the
real
temper
and
idiosyncrasy
of
the
financier
do
they
give
us
in
his
description
of
places
in
his
zola
puts
down
what
he
sees
with
his
own
eyes
and
though
it
is
often
done
at
utterly
disproportionate
length
it
is
at
all
events
done
with
exactitude
but
in
the
far
more
important
observation
of
men
and
women
he
is
content
with
knowledge
the
knowledge
of
a
man
who
sees
the
world
through
a
formula
zola
sees
in
humanity
bête
he
sees
the
beast
in
all
its
transformations
but
he
sees
only
the
beast
he
has
never
looked
at
life
impartially
he
has
never
seen
it
as
it
is
his
realism
is
a
distorted
idealism
and
the
man
who
considers
himself
the
first
to
paint
humanity
as
it
really
is
will
be
remembered
in
the
future
as
the
most
idealistic
writer
of
his
time
stéphane
mallarmé
stéphane
mallarmé
was
one
of
those
who
love
literature
too
much
to
write
it
except
by
fragments
in
whom
the
desire
of
perfection
brings
its
own
defeat
with
either
more
or
less
ambition
he
would
have
done
more
to
achieve
himself
he
was
always
divided
between
an
absolute
aim
at
the
absolute
that
is
the
unattainable
and
a
too
logical
disdain
for
the
compromise
by
which
after
all
literature
is
literature
carry
the
theories
of
mallarmé
to
a
practical
conclusion
multiply
his
powers
in
a
direct
ratio
and
you
have
wagner
it
is
his
failure
not
to
be
wagner
and
wagner
having
existed
it
was
for
him
to
be
something
more
to
complete
wagner
well
not
being
able
to
be
that
it
was
a
matter
of
sincere
indifference
to
him
whether
he
left
one
or
two
little
limited
masterpieces
of
formal
verse
and
prose
the
more
or
the
less
it
was
the
work
that
he
dreamed
of
the
new
art
more
than
a
new
religion
whose
precise
form
in
the
world
he
was
never
quite
able
to
settle
auteur
difficile
in
the
phrase
of
catulle
mendès
it
has
always
been
to
what
he
himself
calls
a
labyrinth
illuminated
by
flowers
that
mallarmé
has
felt
it
due
to
their
own
dignity
to
invite
his
readers
to
their
own
dignity
and
also
to
his
mallarmé
was
obscure
not
so
much
because
he
wrote
differently
as
because
he
thought
differently
from
other
people
his
mind
was
elliptical
and
relying
with
undue
confidence
on
the
intelligence
of
his
readers
he
emphasised
the
effect
of
what
was
unlike
other
people
in
his
mind
by
resolutely
ignoring
even
the
links
of
connection
that
existed
between
them
never
having
aimed
at
popularity
he
never
needed
as
most
writers
need
to
make
the
first
advances
he
made
neither
intrusion
upon
nor
concession
to
those
who
after
all
were
not
obliged
to
read
him
and
when
he
spoke
he
considered
it
neither
needful
nor
seemly
to
listen
in
order
to
hear
whether
he
was
heard
to
the
charge
of
obscurity
he
replied
with
sufficient
disdain
that
there
are
many
who
do
not
know
how
to
read
except
the
newspaper
he
adds
in
one
of
those
disconcerting
parentheses
which
make
his
work
to
those
who
rightly
apprehend
it
so
full
of
wise
limitations
so
safe
from
hasty
or
seemingly
final
conclusions
no
one
in
our
time
has
more
significantly
vindicated
the
supreme
right
of
the
artist
in
the
aristocracy
of
letters
wilfully
perhaps
not
always
wisely
but
nobly
logically
has
not
every
artist
shrunk
from
that
making
of
himself
a
motley
to
the
view
that
handing
over
of
his
naked
soul
to
the
laughter
of
the
multitude
but
who
in
our
time
has
wrought
so
subtle
a
veil
shining
on
this
side
where
the
few
are
a
thick
cloud
on
the
other
where
are
the
many
the
oracles
have
always
had
the
wisdom
to
hide
their
secrets
in
the
obscurity
of
many
meanings
or
of
what
has
seemed
meaningless
and
might
it
not
after
all
be
the
finest
epitaph
for
a
man
of
letters
to
be
able
to
say
even
after
the
writing
of
many
books
i
have
kept
my
secret
i
have
not
betrayed
myself
to
the
multitude
but
to
mallarmé
certainly
there
might
be
applied
the
significant
warning
of
rossetti
yet
woe
to
thee
if
once
thou
yield
unto
the
act
of
doing
nought
after
a
life
of
persistent
devotion
to
literature
he
has
left
enough
poems
to
make
a
single
small
volume
less
certainly
than
a
hundred
poems
in
all
a
single
volume
of
prose
a
few
pamphlets
and
a
prose
translation
of
the
poems
of
poe
it
is
because
among
these
there
are
masterpieces
poems
which
are
among
the
most
beautiful
poems
written
in
our
time
prose
which
has
all
the
subtlest
qualities
of
prose
that
quitting
the
abstract
point
of
view
we
are
forced
to
regret
the
fatal
enchantments
fatal
for
him
of
theories
which
are
so
greatly
needed
by
others
so
valuable
for
our
instruction
if
we
are
only
a
little
careful
in
putting
them
into
practice
in
estimating
the
significance
of
stéphane
mallarmé
it
is
necessary
to
take
into
account
not
only
his
verse
and
prose
but
almost
more
than
these
the
tuesdays
of
the
rue
de
rome
in
which
he
gave
himself
freely
to
more
than
one
generation
no
one
who
has
ever
climbed
those
four
flights
of
stairs
will
have
forgotten
the
narrow
homely
interior
elegant
with
a
sort
of
scrupulous
dutch
comfort
the
heavy
carved
furniture
the
tall
clock
the
portraits
manet
whistler
on
the
walls
the
table
on
which
the
china
bowl
odorous
with
tobacco
was
pushed
from
hand
to
hand
above
all
the
mallarmé
from
which
he
would
rise
quietly
to
stand
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
mantelpiece
while
one
hand
the
hand
which
did
not
hold
the
cigarette
would
sketch
out
one
of
those
familiar
gestures
peu
de
prêtre
un
peu
de
in
rodenbach
admirable
phrase
lesquels
il
avait
chaque
fois
dans
la
conversation
comme
on
entre
en
one
of
the
best
talkers
of
our
time
he
was
unlike
most
other
fine
talkers
harmonious
with
his
own
theories
in
giving
no
monologues
in
allowing
every
liberty
to
his
guests
to
the
conversation
in
his
perfect
readiness
to
follow
the
slightest
indication
to
embroider
upon
any
frame
with
any
material
presented
to
him
there
would
have
been
something
almost
of
the
challenge
of
the
improvisatore
in
this
easily
moved
alertness
of
mental
attitude
had
it
not
been
for
the
singular
gentleness
with
which
mallarmé
intelligence
moved
in
these
considerable
feats
with
the
negligence
of
the
perfect
acrobat
he
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
brushing
the
dust
off
your
own
ideas
settling
arranging
them
a
little
before
he
gave
them
back
to
you
surprisingly
luminous
it
was
only
afterwards
that
you
realised
how
small
had
been
your
own
part
in
the
matter
as
well
as
what
it
meant
to
have
enlightened
without
dazzling
you
but
there
was
always
the
feeling
of
comradeship
the
comradeship
of
a
master
whom
while
you
were
there
at
least
you
did
not
question
and
that
very
feeling
lifted
you
in
your
own
estimation
nearer
to
art
invaluable
it
seems
to
me
those
tuesdays
must
have
been
to
the
young
men
of
two
generations
who
have
been
making
french
literature
they
were
unique
certainly
in
the
experience
of
the
young
englishman
who
was
always
so
cordially
received
there
with
so
flattering
a
cordiality
here
was
a
house
in
which
art
literature
was
the
very
atmosphere
a
religious
atmosphere
and
the
master
of
the
house
in
his
just
a
little
solemn
simplicity
a
priest
i
never
heard
the
price
of
a
book
mentioned
or
the
number
of
thousand
francs
which
a
popular
author
had
been
paid
for
his
last
volume
here
in
this
one
literary
house
literature
was
unknown
as
a
trade
and
above
all
the
questions
that
were
discussed
were
never
at
least
in
mallarmé
treatment
in
his
guidance
of
them
other
than
essential
questions
considerations
of
art
in
the
abstract
of
literature
before
it
coagulates
into
a
book
of
life
as
its
amusing
and
various
web
spins
the
stuff
of
art
when
indeed
the
conversation
by
some
untimely
hazard
drifted
too
near
to
one
became
for
a
moment
perhaps
inconveniently
practical
it
was
mallarmé
solicitous
politeness
to
wait
a
little
constrained
almost
uneasy
rolling
his
cigarette
in
silence
until
the
disturbing
moment
had
passed
there
were
other
disturbing
moments
sometimes
i
remember
one
night
rather
late
the
sudden
irruption
of
de
heredia
coming
on
after
a
and
seating
himself
in
his
evening
dress
precisely
in
mallarmé
favourite
chair
he
was
intensely
amusing
voluble
floridly
vehement
mallarmé
i
am
sure
was
delighted
to
see
him
but
the
loud
voice
was
a
little
trying
to
his
nerves
and
then
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
without
his
chair
he
was
like
a
cat
that
has
been
turned
out
of
its
favourite
corner
as
he
roamed
uneasily
about
the
room
resting
an
unaccustomed
elbow
on
the
sideboard
visibly
at
a
disadvantage
for
the
attitude
of
those
young
men
some
of
them
no
longer
exactly
young
who
frequented
the
tuesdays
was
certainly
the
attitude
of
the
disciple
mallarmé
never
exacted
it
he
seemed
never
to
notice
it
yet
it
meant
to
him
all
the
same
a
good
deal
as
it
meant
and
in
the
best
sense
a
good
deal
to
them
he
loved
art
with
a
supreme
disinterestedness
and
it
was
for
the
sake
of
art
that
he
wished
to
be
really
a
master
for
he
knew
that
he
had
something
to
teach
that
he
had
found
out
some
secrets
worth
knowing
that
he
had
discovered
a
point
of
view
which
he
could
to
some
degree
perpetuate
in
those
young
men
who
listened
to
him
and
to
them
this
free
kind
of
apprenticeship
was
beyond
all
that
it
gave
in
direct
counsels
in
the
pattern
of
work
a
noble
influence
mallarmé
quiet
laborious
life
was
for
some
of
them
the
only
counterpoise
to
the
bohemian
example
of
the
or
the
where
art
is
loved
but
with
something
of
haste
in
a
very
changing
devotion
it
was
impossible
to
come
away
from
mallarmé
without
some
tranquillising
influence
from
that
quiet
place
some
impersonal
ambition
towards
excellence
the
resolve
at
least
to
write
a
sonnet
a
page
of
prose
that
should
be
in
its
own
way
as
perfect
as
one
could
make
it
worthy
of
mallarmé
poetry
said
mallarmé
is
the
language
of
a
state
of
crisis
and
all
his
poems
are
the
evocation
of
a
passing
ecstasy
arrested
in
this
ecstasy
is
never
the
mere
instinctive
cry
of
the
heart
the
simple
human
joy
or
sorrow
which
like
the
parnassians
but
for
not
quite
the
same
reason
he
did
not
admit
in
poetry
it
is
a
mental
transposition
of
emotion
or
sensation
veiled
with
atmosphere
and
becoming
as
it
becomes
a
poem
pure
beauty
here
for
instance
in
a
poem
which
i
have
translated
line
for
line
and
almost
word
for
word
a
delicate
emotion
a
figure
vaguely
divined
a
landscape
magically
evoked
blend
in
a
single
effect
sigh
my
soul
calm
sister
towards
thy
brow
whereon
scarce
grieves
an
autumn
strewn
already
with
its
russet
leaves
and
towards
the
wandering
sky
of
thine
angelic
eye
mounts
as
in
melancholy
gardens
may
arise
some
faithful
fountain
sighing
whitely
towards
the
blue
towards
the
blue
pale
and
pure
that
sad
october
knew
when
in
those
depths
it
mirrored
languors
infinite
and
agonising
leaves
upon
the
waters
white
windily
drifting
traced
a
furrow
cold
and
dun
where
in
one
long
last
ray
lingered
the
yellow
sun
another
poem
comes
a
little
closer
to
nature
but
with
what
exquisite
precautions
and
with
what
surprising
novelty
in
its
unhesitating
touch
on
actual
things
the
flesh
is
sad
alas
and
all
the
books
are
read
flight
only
flight
i
feel
that
birds
are
wild
to
tread
the
floor
of
unknown
foam
and
to
attain
the
skies
nought
neither
ancient
gardens
mirrored
in
the
eyes
shall
hold
this
heart
that
bathes
in
waters
its
delight
o
nights
nor
yet
my
waking
lamp
whose
lonely
light
shadows
the
vacant
paper
whiteness
profits
best
nor
the
young
wife
who
rocks
her
baby
on
her
breast
i
will
depart
o
steamer
swaying
rope
and
spar
lift
anchor
for
exotic
lands
that
lie
afar
a
weariness
outworn
by
cruel
hopes
still
clings
to
the
last
farewell
handkerchief
last
beckonings
and
are
not
these
the
masts
inviting
storms
not
these
that
an
awakening
wind
bends
over
wrecking
seas
lost
not
a
sail
a
sail
a
flowering
isle
ere
long
but
o
my
heart
hear
thou
hear
thou
the
sailors
song
these
need
i
say
belong
to
the
earlier
period
in
which
mallarmé
had
not
yet
withdrawn
his
light
into
the
cloud
and
to
the
same
period
belong
the
one
of
which
perhaps
the
most
exquisite
i
will
translate
here
autumn
lament
ever
since
maria
left
me
for
another
star
which
orion
altair
or
thou
green
venus
i
have
always
cherished
solitude
how
many
long
days
i
have
passed
alone
with
my
cat
by
i
mean
without
a
material
being
and
my
cat
is
a
mystical
companion
a
spirit
i
may
say
then
that
i
have
passed
long
days
alone
with
my
cat
and
alone
with
one
of
the
last
writers
of
the
roman
decadence
for
since
the
white
creature
is
no
more
strangely
and
singularly
i
have
loved
all
that
may
be
summed
up
in
the
word
fall
thus
in
the
year
my
favourite
season
is
during
those
last
languid
summer
days
which
come
just
before
the
autumn
and
in
the
day
the
hour
when
i
take
my
walk
is
the
hour
when
the
sun
lingers
before
fading
with
rays
of
on
the
grey
walls
and
of
on
the
and
just
so
the
literature
from
which
my
soul
demands
delight
must
be
the
poetry
dying
out
of
the
last
moments
of
rome
provided
nevertheless
that
it
breathes
nothing
of
the
rejuvenating
approach
of
the
barbarians
and
does
not
stammer
the
infantile
latin
of
the
first
christian
prose
i
read
then
one
of
those
beloved
poems
whose
streaks
of
rouge
have
more
charm
for
me
than
the
fresh
cheek
of
youth
and
buried
my
hand
in
the
fur
of
the
pure
animal
when
a
began
to
sing
languishingly
and
melancholy
under
my
window
it
played
in
the
long
alley
of
poplars
whose
leaves
seem
mournful
to
me
even
in
spring
since
maria
passed
that
way
with
the
tapers
for
the
last
time
yes
sad
people
instrument
truly
the
piano
glitters
the
violin
brings
one
torn
fibres
to
the
light
but
the
in
the
twilight
of
memory
has
set
me
despairingly
dreaming
while
it
murmured
a
gaily
vulgar
air
such
as
puts
mirth
into
the
heart
of
the
suburbs
an
an
empty
air
how
came
it
that
its
refrain
went
to
my
very
soul
and
made
me
weep
like
a
romantic
ballad
i
drank
it
in
and
i
did
not
throw
a
penny
out
of
the
window
for
fear
of
disturbing
my
own
impression
and
of
perceiving
that
the
instrument
was
not
singing
by
itself
between
these
characteristic
clear
and
beautiful
poems
in
verse
and
in
prose
and
the
opaque
darkness
of
the
later
writings
come
one
or
two
poems
perhaps
the
finest
of
all
in
which
already
clearness
is
a
secondary
grace
but
in
which
a
subtle
rapture
finds
incomparable
expression
and
have
already
been
introduced
in
different
ways
to
english
readers
the
former
by
gosse
in
a
detailed
analysis
the
latter
by
a
translation
into
verse
and
debussy
in
his
new
music
has
taken
almost
for
his
new
point
of
departure
interpreting
it
at
all
events
faultlessly
in
these
two
poems
i
find
mallarmé
at
the
moment
when
his
own
desire
achieves
itself
when
he
attains
ideal
that
the
most
complete
work
of
the
poet
should
be
that
which
in
its
final
achievement
becomes
a
perfect
music
every
word
is
a
jewel
scattering
and
recapturing
sudden
fire
every
image
is
a
symbol
and
the
whole
poem
is
visible
music
after
this
point
began
that
fatal
last
period
which
comes
to
most
artists
who
have
thought
too
curiously
or
dreamed
too
remote
dreams
or
followed
a
too
wandering
beauty
mallarmé
had
long
been
too
conscious
that
all
publication
is
almost
a
speculation
on
one
modesty
for
one
silence
that
to
unclench
the
fists
breaking
one
sedentary
dream
for
a
ruffling
face
to
face
with
the
idea
was
after
all
unnecessary
to
his
own
conception
of
himself
a
mere
way
of
convincing
the
public
that
one
exists
and
having
achieved
as
he
thought
the
right
to
abstain
from
doing
anything
exceptional
he
devoted
himself
doubly
to
silence
seldom
condescending
to
write
he
wrote
now
only
for
himself
and
in
a
manner
which
certainly
saved
him
from
intrusion
some
of
meredith
poems
and
occasional
passages
of
his
prose
can
alone
give
in
english
some
faint
idea
of
the
later
prose
and
verse
of
mallarmé
the
verse
could
not
i
think
be
translated
of
the
prose
in
which
an
extreme
lucidity
of
thought
comes
to
us
but
glimmeringly
through
the
entanglements
of
a
construction
part
latin
part
english
i
shall
endeavour
to
translate
some
fragments
in
speaking
of
the
theoretic
writings
contained
in
the
two
volumes
of
et
and
it
is
the
distinction
of
mallarmé
to
have
aspired
after
an
impossible
liberation
of
the
soul
of
literature
from
what
is
fretting
and
constraining
in
the
body
of
that
death
which
is
the
mere
literature
of
words
words
he
has
realised
are
of
value
only
as
a
notation
of
the
free
breath
of
the
spirit
words
therefore
must
be
employed
with
an
extreme
care
in
their
choice
and
adjustment
in
setting
them
to
reflect
and
chime
upon
one
another
yet
least
of
all
for
their
own
sake
for
what
they
can
never
except
by
suggestion
express
every
soul
is
a
melody
he
has
said
which
needs
to
be
readjusted
and
for
that
are
the
flute
or
viol
of
each
the
word
treated
indeed
with
a
kind
of
adoration
as
he
says
is
so
regarded
in
a
magnificent
sense
in
which
it
is
apprehended
as
a
living
thing
itself
the
vision
rather
than
the
reality
at
least
the
philtre
of
the
evocation
the
word
chosen
as
he
chooses
it
is
for
him
a
liberating
principle
by
which
the
spirit
is
extracted
from
matter
takes
form
perhaps
assumes
immortality
thus
an
artificiality
even
in
the
use
of
words
that
seeming
artificiality
which
comes
from
using
words
as
if
they
had
never
been
used
before
that
chimerical
search
after
the
virginity
of
language
is
but
the
paradoxical
outward
sign
of
an
extreme
discontent
with
even
the
best
of
their
service
writers
who
use
words
fluently
seeming
to
disregard
their
importance
do
so
from
an
unconscious
confidence
in
their
expressiveness
which
the
scrupulous
thinker
the
precise
dreamer
can
never
place
in
the
most
carefully
chosen
among
them
to
evoke
by
some
elaborate
instantaneous
magic
of
language
without
the
formality
of
an
after
all
impossible
description
to
be
rather
than
to
express
that
is
what
mallarmé
has
consistently
and
from
the
first
sought
in
verse
and
prose
and
he
has
sought
this
wandering
illusive
beckoning
butterfly
the
soul
of
dreams
over
more
and
more
entangled
ground
and
it
has
led
him
into
the
depths
of
many
forests
far
from
the
sunlight
to
say
that
he
has
found
what
he
sought
is
impossible
but
is
it
possible
to
avoid
saying
how
heroic
a
search
and
what
marvellous
discoveries
by
the
way
i
think
i
understand
though
i
can
not
claim
his
own
authority
for
my
supposition
the
way
in
which
mallarmé
wrote
verse
and
the
reason
why
it
became
more
and
more
abstruse
more
and
more
unintelligible
remember
his
principle
that
to
name
is
to
destroy
to
suggest
is
to
create
note
further
that
he
condemns
the
inclusion
in
verse
of
anything
but
for
example
the
horror
of
the
forest
or
the
silent
thunder
afloat
in
the
leaves
not
the
intrinsic
dense
wood
of
the
trees
he
has
received
then
a
mental
sensation
let
it
be
the
horror
of
the
forest
this
sensation
begins
to
form
in
his
brain
at
first
probably
no
more
than
a
rhythm
absolutely
without
words
gradually
thought
begins
to
concentrate
itself
but
with
an
extreme
care
lest
it
should
break
the
tension
on
which
all
depends
upon
the
sensation
already
struggling
to
find
its
own
consciousness
delicately
stealthily
with
infinitely
timid
precaution
words
present
themselves
at
first
in
silence
every
word
seems
like
a
desecration
seems
the
clearer
it
is
to
throw
back
the
original
sensation
farther
and
farther
into
the
darkness
but
guided
always
by
the
rhythm
which
is
the
executive
soul
as
in
aristotle
definition
the
soul
is
the
form
of
the
body
words
come
slowly
one
by
one
shaping
the
message
imagine
the
poem
already
written
down
at
least
composed
in
its
very
imperfection
it
is
clear
it
shows
the
links
by
which
it
has
been
riveted
together
the
whole
process
of
its
construction
can
be
studied
now
most
writers
would
be
content
but
with
mallarmé
the
work
has
only
begun
in
the
final
result
there
must
be
no
sign
of
the
making
there
must
be
only
the
thing
made
he
works
over
it
word
by
word
changing
a
word
here
for
its
colour
which
is
not
precisely
the
colour
required
a
word
there
for
the
break
it
makes
in
the
music
a
new
image
occurs
to
him
rarer
subtler
than
the
one
he
has
used
the
image
is
transferred
by
the
time
the
poem
has
reached
as
it
seems
to
him
a
flawless
unity
the
steps
of
the
progress
have
been
only
too
effectually
effaced
and
while
the
poet
who
has
seen
the
thing
from
the
beginning
still
sees
the
relation
of
point
to
point
the
reader
who
comes
to
it
only
in
its
final
stage
finds
himself
in
a
not
unnatural
bewilderment
pursue
this
manner
of
writing
to
its
ultimate
development
start
with
an
enigma
and
then
withdraw
the
key
of
the
enigma
and
you
arrive
easily
at
the
frozen
impenetrability
of
those
latest
sonnets
in
which
the
absence
of
all
punctuation
is
scarcely
a
recognisable
hindrance
that
i
fancy
to
myself
was
his
actual
way
of
writing
here
in
what
i
prefer
to
give
as
a
corollary
is
the
theory
symbolist
decadent
or
mystic
the
schools
thus
called
by
themselves
or
thus
hastily
labelled
by
our
adopt
for
the
point
of
an
idealism
which
similarly
as
in
fugues
in
sonatas
rejects
the
materials
and
as
brutal
a
direct
thought
ordering
them
to
retain
no
more
than
suggestion
to
be
instituted
a
relation
between
images
exact
and
that
therefrom
should
detach
itself
a
third
aspect
fusible
and
clear
offered
to
the
divination
abolished
the
pretension
æsthetically
an
error
despite
its
dominion
over
almost
all
the
masterpieces
to
enclose
within
the
subtle
paper
other
than
for
example
the
horror
of
the
forest
or
the
silent
thunder
afloat
in
the
leaves
not
the
intrinsic
dense
wood
of
the
trees
some
few
bursts
of
personal
pride
veridically
trumpeted

the
architecture
of
the
palace
alone

not
of
stone
on
which
the
pages
would
close

for
example
it

a
flower

voice

and
exquisite
the
one

from
all

the
elocutionary

to
the
words

by
the

their
inequality

take
light
from
mutual
reflection
like
an
actual
trail
of
fire
over
precious
stones
replacing
the
old
lyric
afflatus
or
the
enthusiastic
personal
direction
of
the
phrase
the
verse
which
out
of
many
vocables
remakes
an
entire
word
new
unknown
to
the
language
and
as
if
magical
attains
this
isolation
of
speech
whence
it
being
music
which
rejoins
verse
to
form
since
wagner
poetry
the
final
conclusion
that
we
are
now
precisely
at
the
moment
of
seeking
before
that
breaking
up
of
the
large
rhythms
of
literature
and
their
scattering
in
articulate
almost
instrumental
nervous
waves
an
art
which
shall
complete
the
transposition
into
the
book
of
the
symphony
or
simply
recapture
our
own
for
it
is
not
in
elementary
sonorities
of
brass
strings
wood
unquestionably
but
in
the
intellectual
word
at
its
utmost
that
fully
and
evidently
we
should
find
drawing
to
itself
all
the
correspondences
of
the
universe
the
supreme
music
here
literally
translated
in
exactly
the
arrangement
of
the
original
are
some
passages
out
of
the
theoretic
writings
which
i
have
brought
together
to
indicate
what
seem
to
me
the
main
lines
of
doctrine
it
is
the
doctrine
which
as
i
have
already
said
had
been
divined
by
gérard
de
nerval
but
what
in
gérard
was
pure
vision
becomes
in
mallarmé
a
logical
sequence
of
meditation
mallarmé
was
not
a
mystic
to
whom
anything
came
unconsciously
he
was
a
thinker
in
whom
an
extraordinary
subtlety
of
mind
was
exercised
on
always
explicit
though
by
no
means
the
common
problems
a
seeker
after
something
in
the
world
that
is
there
in
no
satisfying
measure
or
not
at
all
he
pursued
his
search
with
unwearying
persistence
with
a
sharp
mental
division
of
dream
and
idea
certainly
very
lucid
to
himself
however
he
may
have
failed
to
render
his
expression
clear
to
others
and
i
for
one
can
not
doubt
that
he
was
for
the
most
part
entirely
right
in
his
statement
and
analysis
of
the
new
conditions
under
which
we
are
now
privileged
or
condemned
to
write
his
obscurity
was
partly
his
failure
to
carry
out
the
spirit
of
his
own
directions
but
apart
from
obscurity
which
we
may
all
be
fortunate
enough
to
escape
is
it
possible
for
a
writer
at
the
present
day
to
be
quite
simple
with
the
old
objective
simplicity
in
either
thought
or
expression
to
be
to
be
archaic
is
not
to
be
either
natural
or
simple
i
affirm
that
it
is
not
natural
to
be
what
is
called
natural
any
longer
we
have
no
longer
the
mental
attitude
of
those
to
whom
a
story
was
but
a
story
and
all
stories
good
we
have
realised
since
it
was
proved
to
us
by
poe
not
merely
that
the
age
of
epics
is
past
but
that
no
long
poem
was
ever
written
the
finest
long
poem
in
the
world
being
but
a
series
of
short
poems
linked
together
by
prose
and
naturally
we
can
no
longer
write
what
we
can
no
longer
accept
symbolism
implicit
in
all
literature
from
the
beginning
as
it
is
implicit
in
the
very
words
we
use
comes
to
us
now
at
last
quite
conscious
of
itself
offering
us
the
only
escape
from
our
many
imprisonments
we
find
a
new
an
older
sense
in
the
so
forms
of
things
the
world
which
we
can
no
longer
believe
in
as
the
satisfying
material
object
it
was
to
our
grandparents
becomes
transfigured
with
a
new
light
words
which
long
usage
had
darkened
almost
out
of
recognition
take
fresh
lustre
and
it
is
on
the
lines
of
that
spiritualising
of
the
word
that
perfecting
of
form
in
its
capacity
for
allusion
and
suggestion
that
confidence
in
the
eternal
correspondences
between
the
visible
and
the
invisible
universe
which
mallarmé
taught
and
too
intermittently
practised
that
literature
must
now
move
if
it
is
in
any
sense
to
move
forward
paul
verlaine
bien
yours
p
verlaine
so
in
its
gay
and
friendly
mingling
of
french
and
english
ended
the
last
letter
i
had
from
verlaine
a
few
days
afterwards
came
the
telegram
from
paris
telling
me
of
his
death
in
the
rue
descartes
on
that
january
condemned
to
death
as
he
was
in
victor
hugo
phrase
of
men
in
general
with
a
sort
of
indefinite
reprieve
and
gravely
ill
as
i
had
for
some
time
known
him
to
be
it
was
still
with
a
shock
not
only
of
sorrow
but
of
surprise
that
i
heard
the
news
of
his
death
he
had
suffered
and
survived
so
much
and
i
found
it
so
hard
to
associate
the
idea
of
death
with
one
who
had
always
been
so
passionately
in
love
with
life
more
passionately
in
love
with
life
than
any
man
i
ever
knew
rest
was
one
of
the
delicate
privileges
of
life
which
he
never
loved
he
did
but
endure
it
with
grumbling
gaiety
when
a
claimed
him
and
whenever
he
spoke
to
me
of
the
long
rest
which
has
now
sealed
his
eyelids
it
was
with
a
shuddering
revolt
from
the
thought
of
ever
going
away
into
the
cold
out
of
the
sunshine
which
had
been
so
warm
to
him
with
all
his
pains
misfortunes
and
the
calamities
which
followed
him
step
by
step
all
his
life
i
think
few
men
ever
got
so
much
out
of
their
lives
or
lived
so
fully
so
intensely
with
such
a
genius
for
living
that
indeed
is
why
he
was
a
great
poet
verlaine
was
a
man
who
gave
its
full
value
to
every
moment
who
got
out
of
every
moment
all
that
that
moment
had
to
give
him
it
was
not
always
not
often
perhaps
pleasure
but
it
was
energy
the
vital
force
of
a
nature
which
was
always
receiving
and
giving
out
never
at
rest
never
passive
or
indifferent
or
hesitating
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
convey
to
those
who
did
not
know
him
any
notion
of
how
sincere
he
was
the
word
sincerity
seems
hardly
to
have
emphasis
enough
to
say
in
regard
to
this
one
man
what
it
says
adequately
enough
of
others
he
sinned
and
it
was
with
all
his
humanity
he
repented
and
it
was
with
all
his
soul
and
to
every
occurrence
of
the
day
to
every
mood
of
the
mind
to
every
impulse
of
the
creative
instinct
he
brought
the
same
unparalleled
sharpness
of
sensation
when
in
he
was
my
guest
in
london
i
was
amazed
by
the
exactitude
of
his
memory
of
the
mere
turnings
of
the
streets
the
shapes
and
colours
of
the
buildings
which
he
had
not
seen
for
twenty
years
he
saw
he
felt
he
remembered
everything
with
an
unconscious
mental
selection
of
the
fine
shades
the
essential
part
of
things
or
precisely
those
aspects
which
most
other
people
would
pass
by
few
poets
of
our
time
have
been
more
often
drawn
few
have
been
easier
to
draw
few
have
better
repaid
drawing
than
paul
verlaine
a
face
without
a
beautiful
line
a
face
all
character
full
of
somnolence
and
sudden
fire
in
which
every
irregularity
was
a
kind
of
aid
to
the
hand
could
not
but
tempt
the
artist
desiring
at
once
to
render
a
significant
likeness
and
to
have
his
own
part
in
the
creation
of
a
picture
verlaine
like
all
men
of
genius
had
something
of
the
air
of
the
somnambulist
that
profound
slumber
of
the
face
as
it
was
in
him
with
its
startling
awakenings
it
was
a
face
devoured
by
dreams
feverish
and
somnolent
it
had
earthly
passion
intellectual
pride
spiritual
humility
the
air
of
one
who
remembers
not
without
an
effort
who
is
listening
half
distractedly
to
something
which
other
people
do
not
hear
coming
back
so
suddenly
and
from
so
far
with
the
relief
of
one
who
steps
out
of
that
obscure
shadow
into
the
noisier
forgetfulness
of
life
the
eyes
often
half
closed
were
like
the
eyes
of
a
cat
between
sleeping
and
waking
eyes
in
which
contemplation
was
itself
an
act
a
remarkable
lithograph
by
rothenstein
the
face
lit
by
oblique
eyes
the
folded
hands
thrust
into
the
cheek
gives
with
singular
truth
the
sensation
of
that
restless
watch
on
things
which
this
prisoner
of
so
many
chains
kept
without
slackening
to
verlaine
every
corner
of
the
world
was
alive
with
tempting
and
consoling
and
terrifying
beauty
i
have
never
known
any
one
to
whom
the
sight
of
the
eyes
was
so
intense
and
imaginative
a
thing
to
him
physical
sight
and
spiritual
vision
by
some
strange
alchemical
operation
of
the
brain
were
one
and
in
the
disquietude
of
his
face
which
seemed
to
take
such
close
heed
of
things
precisely
because
it
was
sufficiently
apart
from
them
to
be
always
a
spectator
there
was
a
realisable
process
of
vision
continually
going
on
in
which
all
the
loose
ends
of
the
visible
world
were
being
caught
up
into
a
new
mental
fabric
and
along
with
this
fierce
subjectivity
into
which
the
egoism
of
the
artist
entered
so
unconsciously
and
in
which
it
counted
for
so
much
there
was
more
than
the
usual
amount
of
childishness
always
in
some
measure
present
in
men
of
genius
there
was
a
real
almost
blithe
childishness
in
the
way
in
which
he
would
put
on
his
satanic
expression
of
which
it
was
part
of
the
joke
that
every
one
should
not
be
quite
in
the
secret
it
was
a
whim
of
this
kind
which
made
him
put
at
the
beginning
of
sans
that
very
criminal
image
of
a
head
which
had
so
little
resemblance
with
even
the
shape
indeed
curious
enough
of
his
actual
head
born
under
the
sign
of
saturn
as
he
no
doubt
was
with
that
old
prisoner
head
of
which
he
tells
us
it
was
by
his
amazing
faculty
for
a
simple
kind
of
happiness
that
he
always
impressed
me
i
have
never
seen
so
cheerful
an
invalid
as
he
used
to
be
at
that
hospital
the
hôpital
where
at
one
time
i
used
to
go
and
see
him
every
week
his
whole
face
seemed
to
chuckle
as
he
would
tell
me
in
his
emphatic
confiding
way
everything
that
entered
into
his
head
the
droll
stories
cut
short
by
a
groan
a
lamentation
a
sudden
fury
of
reminiscence
at
which
his
face
would
cloud
or
convulse
the
wild
eyebrows
slanting
up
and
down
and
then
suddenly
the
good
laugh
would
be
back
clearing
the
air
no
one
was
ever
so
responsive
to
his
own
moods
as
verlaine
and
with
him
every
mood
had
the
vehemence
of
a
passion
is
not
his
whole
art
a
delicate
waiting
upon
moods
with
that
perfect
confidence
in
them
as
they
are
which
it
is
a
large
part
of
ordinary
education
to
discourage
in
us
and
a
large
part
of
experience
to
repress
but
to
verlaine
happily
experience
taught
nothing
or
rather
it
taught
him
only
to
cling
the
more
closely
to
those
moods
in
whose
succession
lies
the
more
intimate
part
of
our
spiritual
life
it
is
no
doubt
well
for
society
that
man
should
learn
by
experience
for
the
artist
the
benefit
is
doubtful
the
artist
it
can
not
be
too
clearly
understood
has
no
more
part
in
society
than
a
monk
in
domestic
life
he
can
not
be
judged
by
its
rules
he
can
be
neither
praised
not
blamed
for
his
acceptance
or
rejection
of
its
conventions
social
rules
are
made
by
normal
people
for
normal
people
and
the
man
of
genius
is
fundamentally
abnormal
it
is
the
poet
against
society
society
against
the
poet
a
direct
antagonism
the
shock
of
which
however
it
is
often
possible
to
avoid
by
a
compromise
so
much
licence
is
allowed
on
the
one
side
so
much
liberty
foregone
on
the
other
the
consequences
are
not
always
of
the
best
art
being
generally
the
loser
but
there
are
certain
natures
to
which
compromise
is
impossible
and
the
nature
of
verlaine
was
one
of
these
natures
the
soul
of
an
immortal
child
says
one
who
has
understood
him
better
than
others
charles
morice
that
is
the
soul
of
verlaine
with
all
the
privileges
and
all
the
perils
of
so
being
with
the
sudden
despair
so
easily
distracted
the
vivid
gaieties
without
a
cause
the
excessive
suspicions
and
the
excessive
confidences
the
whims
so
easily
outwearied
the
deaf
and
blind
infatuations
with
especially
the
unceasing
renewal
of
impressions
in
the
incorruptible
integrity
of
personal
vision
and
sensation
years
influences
teachings
may
pass
over
a
temperament
such
as
this
may
irritate
it
may
fatigue
it
transform
it
never
never
so
much
as
to
alter
that
particular
unity
which
consists
in
a
dualism
in
the
division
of
forces
between
the
longing
after
what
is
evil
and
the
adoration
of
what
is
good
or
rather
in
the
antagonism
of
spirit
and
flesh
other
men
their
lives
take
sides
follow
one
direction
verlaine
hesitates
before
a
choice
which
seems
to
him
monstrous
for
with
the
integral
of
irrefutable
human
truth
he
can
not
resign
himself
however
strong
may
be
the
doctrine
however
enticing
may
be
the
passion
to
the
necessity
of
sacrificing
one
to
the
other
and
from
one
to
the
other
he
oscillates
without
a
moment
repose
it
is
in
such
a
sense
as
this
that
verlaine
may
be
said
to
have
learnt
nothing
from
experience
in
the
sense
that
he
learnt
everything
direct
from
life
and
without
comparing
day
with
day
that
the
exquisite
artist
of
the
should
become
the
great
poet
of
it
was
needful
that
things
should
have
happened
as
disastrously
as
they
did
the
marriage
with
the
that
brief
idyl
the
passion
for
drink
those
other
forbidden
passions
vagabondage
an
attempted
crime
the
eighteen
months
of
prison
conversion
followed
as
it
had
to
be
by
relapse
bodily
sickness
poverty
beggary
almost
a
lower
and
lower
descent
into
mean
distresses
it
was
needful
that
all
this
should
happen
in
order
that
the
spiritual
vision
should
eclipse
the
material
vision
but
it
was
needful
that
all
this
should
happen
in
vain
so
far
as
the
conduct
of
life
was
concerned
reflection
in
verlaine
is
pure
waste
it
is
the
speech
of
the
soul
and
the
speech
of
the
eyes
that
we
must
listen
to
in
his
verse
never
the
speech
of
the
reason
and
i
call
him
fortunate
because
going
through
life
with
a
great
unconsciousness
of
what
most
men
spend
their
lives
in
considering
he
was
able
to
abandon
himself
entirely
to
himself
to
his
unimpeded
vision
to
his
unchecked
emotion
to
the
passionate
sincerity
which
in
him
was
genius
french
poetry
before
verlaine
was
an
admirable
vehicle
for
a
really
fine
a
really
poetical
kind
of
rhetoric
with
victor
hugo
for
the
first
time
since
ronsard
the
two
or
three
masterpieces
of
ronsard
and
his
companions
it
had
learnt
to
sing
with
baudelaire
it
had
invented
a
new
vocabulary
for
the
expression
of
subtle
often
perverse
essentially
modern
emotion
and
sensation
but
with
victor
hugo
with
baudelaire
we
are
still
under
the
dominion
of
rhetoric
take
eloquence
and
wring
its
neck
said
verlaine
in
his
poétique
and
he
showed
by
writing
it
that
french
verse
could
be
written
without
rhetoric
it
was
partly
from
his
study
of
english
models
that
he
learnt
the
secret
of
liberty
in
verse
but
it
was
much
more
a
secret
found
by
the
way
in
the
mere
endeavour
to
be
absolutely
sincere
to
express
exactly
what
he
saw
to
give
voice
to
his
own
temperament
in
which
intensity
of
feeling
seemed
to
find
its
own
expression
as
if
by
accident
mes
enfants
absolument
he
tells
us
in
one
of
his
later
poems
and
with
such
a
personality
as
verlaine
to
express
what
more
has
art
to
do
if
it
would
truly
and
in
any
interesting
manner
hold
the
mirror
up
to
nature
for
consider
the
natural
qualities
which
this
man
had
for
the
task
of
creating
a
new
poetry
sincerity
and
the
impression
of
the
moment
followed
to
the
letter
that
is
how
he
defined
his
theory
of
style
in
an
article
written
about
himself
car
nous
voulons
la
nuance
encor
pas
la
couleur
rien
que
la
nuance
as
he
cries
in
his
famous
take
then
his
susceptibility
of
the
senses
an
emotional
susceptibility
not
less
delicate
a
life
sufficiently
troubled
to
draw
out
every
emotion
of
which
he
was
capable
and
with
it
that
absorption
in
the
moment
that
inability
to
look
before
or
after
the
need
to
love
and
the
need
to
confess
each
a
passion
an
art
of
painting
the
fine
shades
of
landscape
of
evoking
atmosphere
which
can
be
compared
only
with
the
art
of
whistler
a
simplicity
of
language
which
is
the
direct
outcome
of
a
simplicity
of
temperament
with
just
enough
consciousness
of
itself
for
a
final
elegance
and
at
the
very
depth
of
his
being
an
almost
fierce
humility
by
which
the
passion
of
love
after
searching
furiously
through
all
his
creatures
finds
god
by
the
way
and
kneels
in
the
dust
before
him
verlaine
was
never
a
theorist
he
left
theories
to
mallarmé
he
had
only
his
divination
and
he
divined
that
poetry
always
desiring
that
miracles
should
happen
had
never
waited
patiently
enough
upon
the
miracle
it
was
by
that
proud
and
humble
mysticism
of
his
temperament
that
he
came
to
realise
how
much
could
be
done
by
in
a
sense
trying
to
do
nothing
and
then
la
musique
avant
toute
chose
de
la
musique
encore
et
toujours
there
are
poems
of
verlaine
which
go
as
far
as
verse
can
go
to
become
pure
music
the
voice
of
a
bird
with
a
human
soul
it
is
part
of
his
simplicity
his
divine
childishness
that
he
abandons
himself
at
times
to
the
song
which
words
begin
to
sing
in
the
air
with
the
same
wise
confidence
with
which
he
abandons
himself
to
the
other
miracles
about
him
he
knows
that
words
are
living
things
which
we
have
not
created
and
which
go
their
way
without
demanding
of
us
the
right
to
live
he
knows
that
words
are
suspicious
not
without
their
malice
and
that
they
resist
mere
force
with
the
impalpable
resistance
of
fire
or
water
they
are
to
be
caught
only
with
guile
or
with
trust
verlaine
has
both
and
words
become
ariel
to
him
they
bring
him
not
only
that
submission
of
the
slave
which
they
bring
to
others
but
all
the
soul
and
in
a
happy
bondage
they
transform
themselves
for
him
into
music
colour
and
shadow
a
disembodied
music
diaphanous
colours
luminous
shadow
they
serve
him
with
so
absolute
a
that
he
can
write
sans
paroles
songs
almost
without
words
in
which
scarcely
a
sense
of
the
interference
of
human
speech
remains
the
ideal
of
lyric
poetry
certainly
is
to
be
this
passive
flawless
medium
for
the
deeper
consciousness
of
things
the
mysterious
voice
of
that
mystery
which
lies
about
us
out
of
which
we
have
come
and
into
which
we
shall
return
it
is
not
without
reason
that
we
can
not
analyse
a
perfect
lyric
with
verlaine
the
sense
of
hearing
and
the
sense
of
sight
are
almost
interchangeable
he
paints
with
sound
and
his
line
and
atmosphere
become
music
it
was
with
the
most
precise
accuracy
that
whistler
applied
the
terms
of
music
to
his
painting
for
painting
when
it
aims
at
being
the
vision
of
reality
la
couleur
rien
que
la
nuance
passes
almost
into
the
condition
of
music
verlaine
landscape
painting
is
always
an
evocation
in
which
outline
is
lost
in
atmosphere
des
beaux

derrière
des
voiles
le
grand
jour
tremblant
de
midi
par
un
ciel
attiédi
le
bleu
fouillis

étoiles
he
was
a
man
certainly
for
whom
the
visible
world
existed
but
for
whom
it
existed
always
as
a
vision
he
absorbed
it
through
all
his
senses
as
the
true
mystic
absorbs
the
divine
beauty
and
so
he
created
in
verse
a
new
voice
for
nature
full
of
the
humble
ecstasy
with
which
he
saw
listened
accepted
cette
âme
qui
se
lamente
en
cette
plaine
dormante
la
nôtre
pas
la
mienne
dis
et
la
tienne
dont
antienne
par
ce
tiède
soir
tout
has
and
with
the
same
attentive
simplicity
with
which
he
found
words
for
the
sensations
of
hearing
and
the
sensations
of
sight
he
found
words
for
the
sensations
of
the
soul
for
the
fine
shades
of
feeling
from
the
moment
when
his
inner
life
may
be
said
to
have
begun
he
was
occupied
with
the
task
of
an
unceasing
confession
in
which
one
seems
to
overhear
him
talking
to
himself
in
that
vague
preoccupied
way
which
he
often
had
here
again
are
words
which
startle
one
by
their
delicate
resemblance
to
thoughts
by
their
winged
flight
from
so
far
by
their
alighting
so
close
the
verse
murmurs
with
such
an
ingenuous
confidence
such
intimate
secrets
that
setting
free
of
verse
which
is
one
of
the
achievements
of
verlaine
was
itself
mainly
an
attempt
to
be
more
and
more
sincere
a
way
of
turning
poetic
artifice
to
new
account
by
getting
back
to
nature
itself
hidden
away
under
the
eloquent
rhetoric
of
hugo
baudelaire
and
the
parnassians
in
the
devotion
of
rhetoric
to
either
beauty
or
truth
there
is
a
certain
consciousness
of
an
audience
of
an
external
judgment
rhetoric
would
convince
be
admired
it
is
the
very
essence
of
poetry
to
be
unconscious
of
anything
between
its
own
moment
of
flight
and
the
supreme
beauty
which
it
will
never
attain
verlaine
taught
french
poetry
that
wise
and
subtle
unconsciousness
it
was
in
so
doing
that
he
fused
his
personality
in
the
words
of
verhaeren
so
profoundly
with
beauty
that
he
left
upon
it
the
imprint
of
a
new
and
henceforth
eternal
attitude
la
fureur
says
verlaine
in
a
passage
of
very
personal
significance
la
fureur
mon
cœur
si
faible
est
fou
quand
quel
et
où
éclair
de
beauté
de
vertu
de
vaillance
luise
il
précipite
il
y
vole
il
y
lance
et
le
temps
étreinte
il
embrasse
cent
fois
ou
a
poursuivi
de
son
choix
puis
quand
a
replié
son
aile
il
revient
triste
et
seul
bien
souvent
mais
fidèle
et
laissant
aux
ingrats
quelque
chose
de
lui
sang
ou
chair
la
fureur
faire
ah
laissez
faire
and
certainly
this
admirable
and
supremely
dangerous
quality
was
at
the
root
of
verlaine
nature
instinctive
unreasoning
as
he
was
entirely
at
the
mercy
of
the
emotion
or
impression
which
for
the
moment
had
seized
upon
him
it
was
inevitable
that
he
should
be
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
most
imperious
of
instincts
of
passions
and
of
intoxications
and
he
had
the
simple
and
ardent
nature
in
this
again
consistently
childlike
to
which
love
some
kind
of
affection
given
or
returned
is
not
the
luxury
the
exception
which
it
is
to
many
natures
but
a
daily
necessity
to
such
a
temperament
there
may
or
may
not
be
the
one
great
passion
there
will
certainly
be
many
passions
and
in
verlaine
i
find
that
single
childlike
necessity
of
loving
and
being
loved
all
through
his
life
and
on
every
page
of
his
works
i
find
it
unchanged
in
essence
but
constantly
changing
form
in
his
chaste
and
unchaste
devotions
to
women
in
his
passionate
friendships
with
men
in
his
supreme
mystical
adoration
of
god

turn

years
later

is
to
travel
a
long
road
the
hard
long
road
which
verlaine
had
travelled
during
those
years
his
life
was
ruinous
a
disaster
more
sordid
perhaps
than
the
life
of
any
other
poet
and
he
could
write
of
it
from
a
with
this
quite
sufficient
sense
of
its
deprivations
but
all
the
same
it
is
hard
he
laments
in
hôpitaux
after
a
life
of
work
set
off
i
admit
with
accidents
in
which
i
have
had
a
large
share
catastrophes
perhaps
vaguely
premeditated
it
is
hard
i
say
at
years
of
age
in
full
possession
of
all
the
reputation
of
the
to
use
the
frightful
current
phrase
to
which
my
highest
ambitions
could
aspire
hard
hard
hard
indeed
worse
than
hard
to
find
myself
good
god
to
find
myself
the
streets
and
to
have
nowhere
to
lay
my
head
and
support
an
ageing
body
save
the
pillows
and
the
of
a
public
charity
even
now
uncertain
and
which
might
at
any
moment
be
withdrawn
god
forbid
without
apparently
the
fault
of
any
one
oh
not
even
and
above
all
not
mine
yet
after
all
these
sordid
miseries
this
poor
man
vagabondage
all
the
misfortunes
of
one
certainly
irreclaimable
on
which
so
much
stress
has
been
laid
alike
by
friends
and
by
foes
are
externalities
they
are
not
the
man
the
man
the
eternal
lover
passionate
and
humble
remains
unchanged
while
only
his
shadow
wanders
from
morning
to
night
of
the
long
day
the
poems
to
rimbaud
to
lucien
létinois
to
others
the
whole
volume
of
cover
perhaps
as
wide
a
range
of
sentiment
as
bonne
and
pour
the
poetry
of
friendship
has
never
been
sung
with
such
plaintive
sincerity
such
simple
human
feeling
as
in
some
of
these
poems
which
can
only
be
compared
in
modern
poetry
with
a
poem
for
which
verlaine
had
a
great
admiration
tennyson
only
with
verlaine
the
thing
itself
the
affection
or
the
regret
is
everything
there
is
no
room
for
meditation
over
destiny
or
search
for
a
problematical
consolation
other
poems
speak
a
more
difficult
language
in
which
doubtless
de
vivre
avec
les
gens
et
dans
les
counts
for
much
and
fureur
for
more
in
spite
of
the
general
impression
to
the
contrary
an
impression
which
by
no
means
displeased
him
himself
i
must
contend
that
the
sensuality
of
verlaine
brutal
as
it
could
sometimes
be
was
after
all
simple
rather
than
complicated
instinctive
rather
than
perverse
in
the
poetry
of
baudelaire
with
which
the
poetry
of
verlaine
is
so
often
compared
there
is
a
deliberate
science
of
sensual
perversity
which
has
something
almost
monachal
in
its
accentuation
of
vice
with
horror
in
its
passionate
devotion
to
passions
baudelaire
brings
every
complication
of
taste
the
exasperation
of
perfumes
the
irritant
of
cruelty
the
very
odours
and
colours
of
corruption
to
the
creation
and
adornment
of
a
sort
of
religion
in
which
an
eternal
mass
is
served
before
a
veiled
altar
there
is
no
confession
no
absolution
not
a
prayer
is
permitted
which
is
not
set
down
in
the
ritual
with
verlaine
however
often
love
may
pass
into
sensuality
to
whatever
length
sensuality
may
be
hurried
sensuality
is
never
more
than
the
malady
of
love
it
is
love
desiring
the
absolute
seeking
in
vain
seeking
always
and
finally
out
of
the
depths
finding
god
verlaine
conversion
took
place
while
he
was
in
prison
during
those
solitary
eighteen
months
in
company
with
his
thoughts
that
enforced
physical
inactivity
which
could
but
concentrate
his
whole
energy
on
the
only
kind
of
sensation
then
within
his
capacity
the
sensations
of
the
soul
and
of
the
conscience
with
that
promptitude
of
abandonment
which
was
his
genius
he
grasped
feverishly
at
the
succour
of
god
and
the
church
he
abased
himself
before
the
immaculate
purity
of
the
virgin
he
had
not
like
others
who
have
risen
from
the
same
depths
to
the
same
height
of
humiliation
to
despoil
his
nature
of
its
pride
to
conquer
his
intellect
before
he
could
become
vêtu
de
laine
et
all
that
was
simple
humble
childlike
in
him
accepted
that
humiliation
with
the
loving
child
joy
in
penitence
all
that
was
ardent
impulsive
indomitable
in
him
burst
at
once
into
a
flame
of
adoration
he
realised
the
great
secret
of
the
christian
mystics
that
it
is
possible
to
love
god
with
an
extravagance
of
the
whole
being
to
which
the
love
of
the
creature
can
not
attain
all
love
is
an
attempt
to
break
through
the
loneliness
of
individuality
to
fuse
oneself
with
something
not
oneself
to
give
and
to
receive
in
all
the
warmth
of
natural
desire
that
inmost
element
which
remains
so
cold
and
so
invincible
in
the
midst
of
the
soul
it
is
a
desire
of
the
infinite
in
humanity
and
as
humanity
has
its
limits
it
can
but
return
sadly
upon
itself
when
that
limit
is
reached
thus
human
love
is
not
only
an
ecstasy
but
a
despair
and
the
more
profound
a
despair
the
more
ardently
it
is
returned
but
the
love
of
god
considered
only
from
its
human
aspect
contains
at
least
the
illusion
of
infinity
to
love
god
is
to
love
the
absolute
so
far
as
the
mind
of
man
can
conceive
the
absolute
and
thus
in
a
sense
to
love
god
is
to
possess
the
absolute
for
love
has
already
possessed
that
which
it
apprehends
what
the
earthly
lover
realises
to
himself
as
the
image
of
his
beloved
is
after
all
his
own
vision
of
love
not
her
god
must
remain
absconditus
even
to
love
but
the
lover
incapable
of
possessing
infinity
will
have
possessed
all
of
infinity
of
which
he
is
capable
and
his
ecstasy
will
be
flawless
the
human
mind
meditating
on
infinity
can
but
discover
perfection
beyond
perfection
for
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
limitation
in
any
aspect
of
that
which
has
once
been
conceived
as
infinite
in
place
of
that
deception
which
comes
from
the
shock
of
a
beyond
which
humanity
can
not
conceive
of
humanity
there
is
only
a
divine
rage
against
the
limits
of
human
perception
which
by
their
own
failure
seem
at
last
to
limit
for
us
the
infinite
itself
for
once
love
finds
itself
bounded
only
by
its
own
capacity
so
far
does
the
love
of
god
exceed
the
love
of
the
creature
and
so
far
would
it
exceed
that
love
if
god
did
not
exist
but
if
he
does
exist
if
outside
humanity
a
conscient
eternal
perfection
who
has
made
the
world
in
his
image
loves
the
humanity
he
has
made
and
demands
love
in
return
if
the
spirit
of
his
love
is
as
a
breath
over
the
world
suggesting
strengthening
the
love
which
it
desires
seeking
man
that
man
may
seek
god
itself
the
impulse
which
it
humbles
itself
to
accept
at
man
hands
if
indeed
mon
dieu
dit
mon
fils
il
faut
how
much
more
is
this
love
of
god
in
its
inconceivable
acceptance
and
exchange
the
most
divine
the
only
unending
intoxication
in
the
world
well
it
is
this
realised
sense
of
communion
point
by
point
realised
and
put
into
words
more
simple
more
human
more
instinctive
than
any
poet
since
the
mediæval
mystics
has
found
for
the
delights
of
this
intercourse
that
we
find
in
and
in
the
other
religious
poems
of
verlaine
but
with
verlaine
the
love
of
god
is
not
merely
a
rapture
it
is
a
thanksgiving
for
forgiveness
lying
in
wait
behind
all
the
fair
appearances
of
the
world
he
remembers
the
old
enemy
the
flesh
and
the
sense
of
sin
that
strange
paradox
of
the
reason
is
childishly
strong
in
him
he
laments
his
offence
he
sees
not
only
the
love
but
the
justice
of
god
and
it
seems
to
him
as
in
a
picture
that
the
little
hands
of
the
virgin
are
clasped
in
petition
for
him
religion
is
the
religion
of
the
middle
ages
suis
catholique
he
said
to
me
catholique
du
he
might
have
written
the
ballad
which
villon
made
for
his
mother
and
with
the
same
visual
sense
of
heaven
and
hell
like
a
child
he
tells
his
sins
over
promises
that
he
has
put
them
behind
him
and
finds
such
human
words
to
express
his
gratitude
the
virgin
is
really
to
him
mother
and
friend
he
delights
in
the
simple
peasant
humanity
still
visible
in
her
who
is
also
the
mystical
rose
the
tower
of
ivory
the
gate
of
heaven
and
who
now
extends
her
hands
in
the
gesture
of
pardon
from
a
throne
only
just
lower
than
the
throne
of
god
experience
i
have
said
taught
verlaine
nothing
religion
had
no
more
stable
influence
upon
his
conduct
then
experience
in
that
apology
for
himself
which
he
wrote
under
the
anagram
of
pauvre
lelian
he
has
stated
the
case
with
his
usual
sincerity
i
believe
he
says
and
i
sin
in
thought
as
in
action
i
believe
and
i
repent
in
thought
if

i

and

the
instant
after
the
remembrance
the
hope
the
invocation
of
a

delights
me
with
or
without
remorse
sometimes
under
the
very
form
of

with

condemn

as

a

and
indeed
i
would
echo
a
hundred
times
no
it
is
just
this
apparent
complication
of
what
is
really
a
great
simplicity
which
gives
its
singular
value
to
the
poetry
of
verlaine
permitting
it
to
sum
up
in
itself
the
whole
paradox
of

especially
the
weak
passionate
uncertain
troubled

at

huysmans
the
novels
of
huysmans
however
we
may
regard
them
as
novels
are
at
all
events
the
sincere
and
complete
expression
of
a
very
remarkable
personality
from
to
every
story
every
volume
disengages
the
same
atmosphere
the
atmosphere
of
a
london
november
when
mere
existence
is
a
sufficient
burden
and
the
little
miseries
of
life
loom
up
through
the
fog
into
a
vague
and
formidable
grotesqueness
here
for
once
is
a
pessimist
whose
philosophy
is
mere
sensation
and
sensation
after
all
is
the
one
certainty
in
a
world
which
may
be
well
or
ill
arranged
for
ultimate
purposes
but
which
is
certainly
for
each
of
us
what
each
of
us
feels
it
to
be
to
huysmans
the
world
appears
to
be
a
profoundly
uncomfortable
unpleasant
ridiculous
place
with
a
certain
solace
in
various
forms
of
art
and
certain
possibilities
of
at
least
temporary
escape
part
of
his
work
presents
to
us
a
picture
of
ordinary
life
as
he
conceives
it
in
its
uniform
trivial
wretchedness
in
another
part
he
has
made
experiment
in
directions
which
have
seemed
to
promise
escape
relief
in
yet
other
portions
he
has
allowed
himself
the
delight
of
his
sole
enthusiasm
the
enthusiasm
of
art
he
himself
would
be
the
first
to
acknowledge
indeed
practically
he
has
acknowledged
that
the
particular
way
in
which
he
sees
life
is
a
matter
of
personal
temperament
and
constitution
a
matter
of
nerves
the
goncourts
have
never
tired
of
insisting
on
the
fact
of
their
of
pointing
out
its
importance
in
connection
with
the
form
and
structure
of
their
work
their
touch
on
style
even
to
them
the
fin
de
has
come
delicately
as
to
the
chlorotic
fine
ladies
of
the
faubourg
it
has
sharpened
their
senses
to
a
point
of
morbid
acuteness
it
has
given
their
work
a
certain
feverish
beauty
to
huysmans
it
has
given
the
exaggerated
horror
of
whatever
is
ugly
and
unpleasant
with
the
fatal
instinct
of
discovering
the
fatal
necessity
of
contemplating
every
flaw
and
every
discomfort
that
a
somewhat
imperfect
world
can
offer
for
inspection
it
is
the
transposition
of
the
ideal
relative
values
are
lost
for
it
is
the
sense
of
the
disagreeable
only
that
is
heightened
and
the
world
in
this
strange
disorder
of
vision
assumes
an
aspect
which
can
only
be
compared
with
that
of
a
drop
of
impure
water
under
the
microscope
nature
seen
through
a
temperament
is
zola
definition
of
all
art
nothing
certainly
could
be
more
exact
and
expressive
as
a
definition
of
the
art
of
huysmans
to
realise
how
faithfully
and
how
completely
huysmans
has
revealed
himself
in
all
he
has
written
it
is
necessary
to
know
the
man
he
gave
me
the
impression
of
a
cat
some
interviewer
once
wrote
of
him
courteous
perfectly
polite
almost
amiable
but
all
nerves
ready
to
shoot
out
his
claws
at
the
least
word
and
indeed
there
is
something
of
his
favourite
animal
about
him
the
face
is
grey
wearily
alert
with
a
look
of
benevolent
malice
at
first
sight
it
is
commonplace
the
features
are
ordinary
one
seems
to
have
seen
it
at
the
bourse
or
the
stock
exchange
but
gradually
that
strange
unvarying
expression
that
look
of
benevolent
malice
grows
upon
you
as
the
influence
of
the
man
makes
itself
felt
i
have
seen
huysmans
in
his
office
he
is
an
employé
in
the
ministry
of
foreign
affairs
and
a
model
employé
i
have
seen
him
in
a
café
in
various
houses
but
i
always
see
him
in
memory
as
i
used
to
see
him
at
the
house
of
the
bizarre
madame
x
he
leans
back
on
the
sofa
rolling
a
cigarette
between
his
thin
expressive
fingers
looking
at
no
one
and
at
nothing
while
madame
x
moves
about
with
solid
vivacity
in
the
midst
of
her
extraordinary
menagerie
of
the
spoils
of
all
the
world
are
there
in
that
ncredibly
tiny
they
lie
underfoot
they
climb
up
walls
they
cling
to
screens
brackets
and
tables
one
of
your
elbows
menaces
a
japanese
toy
the
other
a
dresden
china
shepherdess
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
clash
in
a
barbaric
discord
of
notes
and
in
a
corner
of
this
fantastic
room
huysmans
lies
back
indifferently
on
the
sofa
with
the
air
of
one
perfectly
resigned
to
the
boredom
of
life
something
is
said
by
my
learned
friend
who
is
to
write
for
the
new
periodical
or
perhaps
it
is
the
young
editor
of
the
new
periodical
who
speaks
or
if
that
were
not
impossible
the
taciturn
englishman
who
accompanies
me
and
huysmans
without
looking
up
and
without
taking
the
trouble
to
speak
very
distinctly
picks
up
the
phrase
transforms
it
more
likely
transpierces
it
in
a
perfectly
turned
sentence
a
phrase
of
impromptu
elaboration
perhaps
it
is
only
a
stupid
book
that
some
one
has
mentioned
or
a
stupid
woman
as
he
speaks
the
book
looms
up
before
one
becomes
monstrous
in
its
dulness
a
masterpiece
and
miracle
of
imbecility
the
unimportant
little
woman
grows
into
a
slow
horror
before
your
eyes
it
is
always
the
unpleasant
aspect
of
things
that
he
seizes
but
the
intensity
of
his
revolt
from
that
unpleasantness
brings
a
touch
of
the
sublime
into
the
very
expression
of
his
disgust
every
sentence
is
an
epigram
and
every
epigram
slaughters
a
reputation
or
an
idea
he
speaks
with
an
accent
as
of
pained
surprise
an
amused
look
of
contempt
so
profound
that
it
becomes
almost
pity
for
human
inbecility
yes
that
is
the
true
huysmans
the
huysmans
of
rebours
and
it
is
just
such
surroundings
that
seem
to
bring
out
his
peculiar
quality
with
this
contempt
for
humanity
this
hatred
of
mediocrity
this
passion
for
a
somewhat
exotic
kind
of
modernity
an
artist
who
is
so
exclusively
an
artist
was
sure
one
day
or
another
to
produce
a
work
which
being
produced
to
please
himself
and
being
entirely
typical
of
himself
would
be
in
a
way
the
quintessence
of
contemporary
decadence
and
it
is
precisely
such
a
book
that
huysmans
has
written
in
the
extravagant
astonishing
all
his
other
books
are
a
sort
of
unconscious
preparation
for
this
one
book
a
sort
of
inevitable
and
scarcely
necessary
sequel
to
it
they
range
themselves
along
the
line
of
a
somewhat
erratic
development
from
baudelaire
through
goncourt
by
way
of
zola
to
the
surprising
originality
of
so
disconcerting
an
exception
to
any
and
every
order
of
things
the
descendant
of
a
long
line
of
dutch
painters
one
of
whom
cornelius
huysmans
has
a
certain
fame
among
the
lesser
landscape
men
of
the
great
period
huysmans
was
born
at
paris
february
his
first
book
drageoir
à
epices
published
at
the
age
of
is
a
of
prose
poems
done
after
baudelaire
of
little
sketches
done
after
dutch
artists
together
with
a
few
studies
of
parisian
landscape
done
after
nature
it
shows
us
the
careful
laboured
work
of
a
really
artistic
temperament
it
betrays
here
and
there
the
spirit
of
acrimonious
observation
which
is
to
count
for
so
much
with
huysmans
in
the
crude
malice
of
for
example
in
the
notation
of
the
richness
of
tone
the
superb
colouring
of
an
old
drunkard
and
one
sees
already
something
of
the
novelty
and
the
precision
of
his
description
the
novelty
and
the
unpleasantness
of
the
subjects
which
he
chooses
to
describe
in
this
vividly
exact
picture
of
the
carcass
of
a
cow
hung
up
outside
a
butcher
shop
as
in
a
hothouse
a
marvellous
vegetation
flourished
in
the
carcass
veins
shot
out
on
every
side
like
trails
of
dishevelled
extended
itself
along
the
body
an
efflorescence
of
entrails
unfurled
their
corollas
and
big
clusters
of
fat
stood
out
a
sharp
white
against
the
red
medley
of
quivering
flesh
in
histoire
fille
which
followed
in
two
years
later
huysmans
is
almost
as
far
from
actual
achievement
as
in
drageoir
à
epices
but
the
book
in
its
crude
attempt
to
deal
realistically
and
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
goncourt
with
the
life
of
a
prostitute
of
the
lowest
depths
marks
a
considerable
advance
upon
the
somewhat
casual
experiments
of
his
earlier
manner
it
is
important
to
remember
that
preceded
fille
and
i
write
what
i
see
what
i
feel
and
what
i
have
experienced
says
the
brief
and
defiant
preface
and
i
write
it
as
well
as
i
can
that
is
all
this
explanation
is
not
an
excuse
it
is
simply
the
statement
of
the
aim
that
i
pursue
in
art
explanation
or
excuse
notwithstanding
the
book
was
forbidden
to
be
sold
in
france
it
is
naturalism
in
its
earliest
and
most
pitiless
stage
naturalism
which
commits
the
error
of
evoking
no
sort
of
interest
in
this
unhappy
creature
who
rises
a
little
from
her
native
gutter
only
to
fall
back
more
woefully
into
the
gutter
again
goncourt
élisa
at
least
interests
us
zola
nana
at
all
events
appeals
to
our
senses
but
marthe
is
a
mere
document
like
her
story
notes
have
been
taken
no
doubt
le
they
have
been
strung
together
and
here
they
are
with
only
an
interesting
brutality
a
curious
sordidness
to
note
in
these
descriptions
that
do
duty
for
psychology
and
incident
alike
in
the
general
flatness
of
character
the
general
dislocation
of
episode
sœurs
vatard
published
in
and
the
short
story
au
dos
which
appeared
in
in
the
famous
zolaist
manifesto
soirées
de
médan
show
the
influence
of
rather
than
of
for
the
time
the
formula
of
zola
has
been
accepted
the
result
is
a
remarkable
piece
of
work
but
a
story
without
a
story
a
frame
without
a
picture
with
zola
there
is
at
all
events
a
beginning
and
an
end
a
chain
of
events
a
play
of
character
upon
incident
but
in
sœurs
there
is
no
reason
for
the
narrative
ever
beginning
or
ending
there
are
miracles
of
description
the
workroom
the
rue
de
sèvres
the
locomotives
the
du
pain
which
lead
to
nothing
there
are
interiors
there
are
interviews
there
are
the
two
céline
and
désirée
and
their
lovers
there
is
what
zola
himself
described
as
ce
milieu
ouvrier
ce
coin
de
misère
et
de
tranquille
ordure
et
naturellement
and
with
it
all
there
is
a
heavy
sense
of
stagnancy
a
dreary
lifelessness
all
that
is
good
in
the
book
reappears
in
vastly
better
company
in
a
novel
which
is
perhaps
more
in
the
direct
line
of
heritage
from
the
of
the
naturalistic
novel
than
any
other
novel
of
the
naturalists
is
the
story
of
monsieur
an
insignificant
personality
one
of
those
poor
creatures
who
have
not
even
the
supreme
consolation
of
being
able
to
complain
of
any
injustice
in
their
fate
for
an
injustice
supposes
at
all
events
a
misunderstood
merit
a
force
andré
is
the
reduction
to
the
bourgeois
formula
of
the
invariable
hero
of
huysmans
he
is
just
enough
removed
from
the
commonplace
to
suffer
from
it
with
acuteness
he
can
not
get
on
either
with
or
without
a
woman
in
his
establishment
betrayed
by
his
wife
he
consoles
himself
with
a
mistress
and
finally
goes
back
to
the
wife
and
the
moral
of
it
all
is
let
us
be
stupidly
comfortable
if
we
can
in
any
way
we
can
but
it
is
almost
certain
that
we
can
not
in
a
less
interesting
story
which
followed
ménage
the
daily
misery
of
the
respectable
folantin
the
government
employé
consists
in
the
impossible
search
for
a
decent
restaurant
a
satisfactory
dinner
for
folantin
too
there
is
only
the
same
counsel
of
a
desperate
an
inevitable
resignation
never
has
the
intolerable
monotony
of
small
inconveniences
been
so
scrupulously
so
unsparingly
chronicled
as
in
these
two
studies
in
the
heroic
degree
of
the
commonplace
it
happens
to
andré
at
a
certain
epoch
in
his
life
to
take
back
an
old
servant
who
had
left
him
many
years
before
he
finds
that
she
has
exactly
the
same
defects
as
before
and
to
find
them
there
again
comments
the
author
did
not
displease
him
he
had
been
expecting
them
all
the
time
he
saluted
them
as
old
acquaintances
yet
with
a
certain
surprise
notwithstanding
to
see
them
neither
grown
nor
diminished
he
noted
for
himself
with
satisfaction
that
the
stupidity
of
his
servant
had
remained
stationary
on
another
page
referring
to
the
inventor
of
cards
huysmans
defines
him
as
one
who
did
something
towards
suppressing
the
free
exchange
of
human
imbecility
having
to
say
in
passing
that
a
girl
has
returned
from
a
ball
she
was
at
home
again
he
observes
after
the
sweat
of
the
waltzes
in
this
invariably
sarcastic
turn
of
the
phrase
this
absoluteness
of
contempt
this
insistence
on
the
disagreeable
we
find
the
note
of
huysmans
particularly
at
this
point
in
his
career
when
like
flaubert
he
forced
himself
to
contemplate
and
to
analyse
the
more
mediocre
manifestations
of
bêtise
there
is
a
certain
perversity
in
this
furious
contemplation
of
stupidity
this
fanatical
insistence
on
the
exasperating
attraction
of
the
sordid
and
the
disagreeable
and
it
is
by
such
stages
that
we
come
to
but
on
the
way
we
have
to
note
a
volume
of
in
which
the
virtuoso
who
is
a
part
of
the
artist
in
huysmans
has
executed
some
of
his
most
astonishing
feats
and
a
volume
on
in
which
the
most
modern
of
artists
in
literature
has
applied
himself
to
the
criticism
the
revelation
rather
of
modernity
in
art
in
the
latter
huysmans
was
the
first
to
declare
the
supremacy
of
degas
the
greatest
artist
that
we
possess
in
france
while
announcing
with
no
less
fervour
the
remote
reactionary
and
intricate
genius
of
gustave
moreau
he
was
the
first
to
discover
raffaëlli
the
painter
of
poor
people
and
the
open
sky
a
sort
of
parisian
millet
as
he
called
him
the
first
to
discover
forain
le
véritable
peintre
de
la
fille
the
first
to
discover
odilon
redon
to
do
justice
to
pissaro
and
paul
gauguin
no
literary
artist
since
baudelaire
has
made
so
valuable
a
contribution
to
art
criticism
and
the
are
after
all
less
exact
in
their
actual
study
less
revolutionary
and
less
really
significant
in
their
critical
judgments
than
the
parisiens
which
in
its
first
edition
was
illustrated
by
etchings
of
forain
and
raffaëlli
is
simply
the
attempt
to
do
in
words
what
those
artists
have
done
in
aquafortis
or
in
pastel
there
are
the
same
parisian
types
the
the
washerwoman
the
man
who
sells
hot
chestnuts
the
same
impressions
of
a
sick
and
sorry
landscape
la
bièvre
for
preference
in
all
its
desolate
and
lamentable
attraction
there
is
a
marvellously
minute
series
of
studies
of
that
typically
parisian
the
huysmans
faculty
of
description
is
here
seen
at
its
fullest
stretch
of
agility
precise
suggestive
with
all
the
outline
and
colour
of

might
even
be
compared
with
the
art

there
is
just
that

touch
wanting

life

is
what
we

we
never
get

speaking

the
of

huysmans
attributes
to
them
a
specious
and
art
demanding
for
its
appreciation
a
certain
initiation
a
certain
special
sense
to
realise
the
full
value
the
real
charm
of
rebours
some
such
initiation
might
be
deemed
necessary
in
its
fantastic
unreality
its
exquisite
artificiality
it
is
the
natural
sequel
of
and
which
are
so
much
more
acutely
sordid
than
the
most
sordid
kind
of
real
life
it
is
the
logical
outcome
of
that
hatred
and
horror
of
human
mediocrity
of
the
mediocrity
of
daily
existence
which
we
have
seen
to
be
the
special
form
of
huysmans
the
motto
taken
from
a
mystic
ruysbroeck
the
admirable
is
a
cry
for
escape
for
the
something
in
the

that
is

the
history
of
a
a
voluntary
exile
from

in
a
new
kind
of
palace
of

des

the
vague
but
typical
hero
is
one
of
those
cases
which
help
us
to
understand
the
full
meaning
of
the
word
which
they
partly
represent
the
last
descendant
of
an
ancient
family
his
impoverished
blood
tainted
by
all
sorts
of
excesses
des
esseintes
finds
himself
at
thirty
le
chemin
dégrisé
seul
abominablement
he
has
already
realised
that
the
world
is
divided
in
great
part
into
swaggerers
and
simpletons
his
one
desire
is
to
hide
himself
away
far
from
the
world
in
some
retreat
where
he
might
deaden
the
sound
of
the
loud
rumbling
of
inflexible
life
as
one
covers
the
street
with
straw
for
sick
people
this
retreat
he
discovers
just
far
enough
from
paris
to
be
safe
from
disturbance
just
near
enough
to
be
saved
from
the
nostalgia
of
the
unattainable
he
succeeds
in
making
his
house
a
paradise
of
the
artificial
choosing
the
tones
of
colour
that
go
best
with
for
it
need
scarcely
be
said
that
des
esseintes
has
effected
a
simple
transposition
of
night
and
day
his
disappearance
from
the
world
has
been
complete
it
seems
to
him
that
the
comfortable
desert
of
his
exile
need
never
cease
to
be
just
such
a
luxurious
solitude
it
seems
to
him
that
he
has
attained
his
desire
that
he
has
attained
to
happiness
disturbing
physical
symptoms
harass
him
from
time
to
time
but
they
pass
it
is
an
effect
of
nerves
that
now
and
again
he
is
haunted
by
remembrance
the
recurrence
of
a
perfume
the
reading
of
a
book
brings
back
a
period
of
life
when
his
deliberate
perversity
was
exercised
actively
in
matters
of
the
senses
there
are
his
fantastic
banquets
his
fantastic
amours
the
de
deuil
miss
urania
the
acrobat
the
episode
of
the
and
the
reincarnation
of
the
sphinx
and
the
chimæra
of
flaubert
the
episode
of
the
boy
madame
laure
a
casual
recollection
brings
up
the
schooldays
of
his
childhood
with
the
jesuits
and
with
that
the
beliefs
of
childhood
the
fantasies
of
the
church
the
catholic
abnegation
of
the
joining
so
strangely
with
the
final
philosophy
of
schopenhauer
at
times
his
brain
is
haunted
by
social
theories
his
dull
hatred
of
the
ordinary
in
life
taking
form
in
the
region
of
ideas
but
in
the
main
he
feeds
himself
with
something
of
the
satisfaction
of
success
on
the
strange
food
for
the
sensations
with
which
he
has
so
laboriously
furnished
himself
there
are
his
books
and
among
these
a
special
library
of
the
latin
writers
of
the
decadence
exasperated
by
virgil
profoundly
contemptuous
of
horace
he
tolerates
lucan
which
is
surprising
adores
petronius
as
well
he
might
and
delights
in
the
neologisms
and
the
exotic
novelty
of
apuleius
his
curiosity
extends
to
the
later
christian
poets
from
the
coloured
verse
of
claudian
down
to
the
verse
which
is
scarcely
verse
of
the
incoherent
ninth
century
he
is
of
course
an
amateur
of
exquisite
printing
of
beautiful
bindings
and
possesses
an
incomparable
baudelaire
édition
tirée
à
un
exemplaire
a
unique
mallarmé
catholicism
being
the
adopted
religion
of
the
decadence
for
its
venerable
age
valuable
in
such
matters
as
the
age
of
an
old
wine
its
vague
excitation
of
the
senses
its
mystical
picturesqueness
des
esseintes
has
a
curious
collection
of
the
later
catholic
literature
where
lacordaire
and
the
comte
de
falloux
veuillot
and
ozanam
find
their
place
side
by
side
with
the
hello
the
amalgam
of
a
monstrous
mysticism
and
a
casuistical
sensuality
barbey
his
collection
of
profane
writers
is
small
but
it
is
selected
for
the
qualities
of
exotic
charm
that
have
come
to
be
his
only
care
in
art
for
the
somewhat
diseased
or
the
somewhat
artificial
beauty
that
alone
can
strike
a
responsive
thrill
from
his
exacting
nerves
considering
within
himself
he
realised
that
a
work
of
art
in
order
to
attract
him
must
come
to
him
with
that
quality
of
strangeness
demanded
by
edgar
poe
but
he
fared
yet
further
along
this
route
and
sought
for
all
the
byzantine
flora
of
the
brain
for
complicated
deliquescences
of
style
he
required
a
troubling
indecision
over
which
he
could
muse
fashioning
it
after
his
will
to
more
of
vagueness
or
of
solid
form
according
to
the
state
of
his
mind
at
the
moment
he
delighted
in
a
work
of
art
both
for
what
it
was
in
itself
and
for
what
it
could
lend
him
he
would
fain
go
along
with
it
thanks
to
it
as
though
sustained
by
an
adjuvant
as
though
borne
in
a
vehicle
into
a
sphere
where
his
sublimated
sensations
would
wake
in
him
an
unaccustomed
stir
the
cause
of
which
he
would
long
and
vainly
seek
to
determine
so
he
comes
to
care
supremely
for
baudelaire
who
more
than
any
other
possessed
the
marvellous
power
of
rendering
with
a
strange
sanity
of
expression
the
most
fleeting
the
most
wavering
morbid
states
of
exhausted
minds
of
desolate
souls
in
flaubert
he
prefers
tentation
de
in
goncourt
faustin
in
zola
faute
de
the
exceptional
the
most
remote
and
outcome
of
each
temperament
and
of
the
three
it
is
the
novel
of
goncourt
that
appeals
to
him
with
special
intimacy
that
novel
which
more
than
any
other
seems
to
express
in
its
exquisitely
perverse
charm
all
that
decadent
civilisation
of
which
des
esseintes
is
the
type
and
symbol
in
poetry
he
has
discovered
the
fine
perfume
the
evanescent
charm
of
paul
verlaine
and
near
that
great
poet
forgetting
strangely
arthur
rimbaud
he
places
two
poets
who
are
curious
the
disconcerting
tumultuous
tristan
corbière
and
the
painted
and
bejewelled
théodore
hannon
with
edgar
poe
he
has
the
instinctive
sympathy
which
drew
baudelaire
to
the
enigmatically
perverse
decadent
of
america
he
delights
sooner
than
all
the
world
in
the
astonishing
unbalanced
unachieved
genius
of
villiers
de
finally
it
is
in
stéphane
mallarmé
that
he
finds
the
incarnation
of
the
decadence
of
a
literature
irreparably
affected
in
its
organism
weakened
in
its
ideas
by
age
exhausted
by
the
excesses
of
syntax
sensitive
only
to
the
curiosity
which
fevers
sick
people
and
yet
hastening
to
say
everything
now
at
the
end
torn
by
the
wish
atone
for
all
its
omissions
of
enjoyment
to
bequeath
its
subtlest
memories
of
sorrow
on
its
but
it
is
not
on
books
alone
that
des
esseintes
nurses
his
sick
and
craving
fancy
he
pushes
his
delight
in
the
artificial
to
the
last
limits
and
diverts
himself
with
a
bouquet
of
jewels
a
concert
of
flowers
an
orchestra
of
liqueurs
an
orchestra
of
perfumes
in
flowers
he
prefers
the
real
flowers
that
imitate
artificial
ones
it
is
the
monstrosities
of
nature
the
offspring
of
unnatural
adulteries
that
he
cherishes
in
the
barbarically
coloured
flowers
the
plants
with
barbaric
names
the
carnivorous
plants
of
the
antilles
morbid
horrors
of
vegetation
chosen
not
for
their
beauty
but
for
their
strangeness
and
his
imagination
plays
harmonies
on
the
sense
of
taste
like
combinations
of
music
from
the
sweetness
of
anisette
the
of
kirsch
the
eager
yet
velvety
sharpness
of
curaçao
the
clarionet
he
combines
scents
weaving
them
into
odorous
melodies
with
effects
like
those
of
the
refrains
of
certain
poems
employing
for
example
the
method
of
baudelaire
in
and
balcon
where
the
last
line
of
the
stanza
is
the
echo
of
the
first
in
the
languorous
progression
of
the
melody
and
above
all
he
has
his
few
carefully
chosen
pictures
with
their
diverse
notes
of
strange
beauty
and
strange
terror
the
two
salomés
of
gustave
moreau
the
religious
persecutions
of
jan
luyken
the
of
odilon
redon
his
favourite
artist
is
gustave
moreau
and
it
is
on
this
superb
and
disquieting
picture
that
he
cares
chiefly
to
dwell
a
throne
like
the
high
altar
of
a
cathedral
rose
beneath
innumerable
arches
springing
from
columns
as
roman
pillars
enamelled
with
bricks
set
with
mosaics
incrusted
with
lapis
lazuli
and
sardonyx
in
a
palace
like
the
basilica
of
an
architecture
at
once
mussulman
and
byzantine
in
the
centre
of
the
tabernacle
surmounting
the
altar
fronted
with
rows
of
circular
steps
sat
the
tetrarch
herod
the
tiara
on
his
head
his
legs
pressed
together
his
hands
on
his
knees
his
face
was
yellow
annulated
with
wrinkles
withered
with
age
his
long
beard
floated
like
a
white
cloud
on
the
jewelled
stars
that
constellated
the
robe
of
netted
old
across
his
breast
around
this
statue
motionless
frozen
in
the
sacred
pose
of
a
hindu
god
perfumes
burned
throwing
out
clouds
of
vapour
pierced
as
by
the
phosphorescent
eyes
of
animals
by
the
fire
of
precious
stones
set
in
the
sides
of
the
throne
then
the
vapour
mounted
unrolling
itself
beneath
arches
where
the
blue
smoke
mingled
with
the
powdered
gold
of
great
sunrays
fallen
jrom
the
domes
in
the
perverse
odour
of
perfumes
in
the
overheated
atmosphere
of
this
church
salomé
her
left
arm
extended
in
a
gesture
of
command
her
bent
right
arm
holding
at
the
level
of
the
face
a
great
lotus
advances
slowly
to
the
sound
of
a
guitar
thrummed
by
a
woman
who
crouches
on
the
floor
with
collected
solemn
almost
august
countenance
she
begins
the
lascivious
dance
that
should
waken
the
sleeping
senses
of
the
aged
herod
her
breasts
undulate
become
rigid
at
the
contact
of
the
whirling
necklets
diamonds
sparkle
on
the
dead
whiteness
of
her
skin
her
bracelets
girdles
rings
shoot
sparks
on
her
triumphal
robe
sewn
with
pearls
flowered
with
silver
sheeted
with
gold
the
jewelled
breastplate
whose
every
stitch
is
a
precious
stone
bursts
into
flame
scatters
in
snakes
of
fire

dazzling
wings
marbled
with

gold
diapered

streaked
with
in
the
work
of
gustave
moreau
conceived
on
no
scriptural
data
des
esseintes
saw
at
last
the
realisation
of
the
strange
superhuman
salomé
that
he
had
dreamed
she
was
no
more
the
mere
who
with
the
corrupt
torsion
of
her
limbs
tears
a
cry
of
desire
from
an
old
man
who
with
her
eddying
breasts
her
palpitating
body
her
quivering
thighs
breaks
the
energy
melts
the
will
of
a
king
she
has
become
the
symbolic
deity
of
indestructible
lust
the
goddess
of
immortal
hysteria
the
accursed
beauty
chosen
among
many
by
the
catalepsy
that
has
stiffened
her
limbs
that
has
hardened
her
muscles
the
monstrous
indifferent
irresponsible
insensible
beast
poisoning
like
helen
of
old
all
that
go
near
to
her
all
that
look
upon
her
all
that
she
touches
it
is
in
such
a
palace
of
art
that
des
esseintes
would
recreate
his
already
body
and
brain
and
the
monotony
of
its
seclusion
is
only
once
broken
by
a
single
excursion
into
the
world
without
this
one
episode
of
action
this
one
touch
of
realism
in
a
book
given
over
to
the
artificial
confined
to
a
record
of
sensation
is
a
projected
voyage
to
london
a
voyage
that
never
occurs
des
esseintes
has
been
reading
dickens
idly
to
quiet
his
nerves
and
the
violent
colours
of
those
scenes
and
characters
have
imposed
themselves
upon
his
imagination
days
of
rain
and
fog
complete
the
picture
of
that
de
brume
et
de
bone
and
suddenly
stung
by
the
unwonted
desire
for
change
he
takes
the
train
to
paris
resolved
to
distract
himself
by
a
visit
to
london
arrived
in
paris
before
his
time
he
takes
a
cab
to
the
office
of
messenger
fancying
himself
as
the
rattle
on
the
roof
and
the
mud
splashes
against
the
windows
already
in
the
midst
of
the
immense
city
its
smoke
and
dirt
he
reaches
messenger
and
there
turning
over
baedekers
and
loses
himself
in
dreams
of
an
imagined
london
he
buys
a
baedeker
and
to
pass
the
time
enters
the
bodéga
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
rivoli
and
the
rue
castiglione
the
is
crowded
with
englishmen
he
sees
as
he
drinks
his
port
and
listens
to
the
unfamiliar
accents
all
the
characters
of
dickens
a
whole
england
of
caricature
as
he
drinks
his
amontillado
the
recollection
of
poe
puts
a
new
horror
into
the
faces
about
him
leaving
the
bodéga
he
steps
out
again
into
the
street
regains
his
cab
and
drives
to
the
english
tavern
of
the
rue
he
has
just
time
for
dinner
and
he
finds
a
place
beside
the
with
their
porcelain
eyes
their
crimson
cheeks
and
orders
a
heavy
english
dinner
which
he
washes
down
with
ale
and
porter
seasoning
his
coffee
as
he
imagines
we
do
in
england
with
gin
as
time
passes
and
the
hour
of
the
train
draws
near
he
begins
to
reflect
vaguely
on
his
project
he
recalls
the
disillusion
of
the
visit
he
had
once
paid
to
holland
does
not
a
similar
disillusion
await
him
in
london
why
travel
when
one
can
travel
so
splendidly
in
a
chair
was
he
not
at
london
already
since
its
odours
its
atmosphere
its
inhabitants
its
food
its
utensils
were
all
about
him
the
train
is
due
but
he
does
not
stir
i
have
felt
and
seen
he
says
to
himself
what
i
wanted
to
feel
and
see
i
have
been
saturated
with
english
life
all
this
time
it
would
be
madness
to
lose
by
a
clumsy
change
of
place
these
imperishable
sensations
so
he
gathers
together
his
luggage
and
goes
home
again
resolving
never
to
abandon
the
docile
phantasmagoria
of
the
brain
for
the
mere
realities
of
the
actual
world
but
his
nervous
malady
one
of
whose
symptoms
had
driven
him
forth
and
brought
him
back
so
spasmodically
is
on
the
increase
he
is
seized
by
hallucinations
haunted
by
sounds
the
hysteria
of
schumann
the
morbid
exaltation
of
berlioz
communicate
themselves
to
him
in
the
music
that
besieges
his
brain
obliged
at
last
to
send
for
a
doctor
we
find
him
at
the
end
of
the
book
ordered
back
to
paris
to
the
normal
life
the
normal
conditions
with
just
that
chance
of
escape
from
death
or
madness
so
suggestively
so
instructively
closes
the
record
of
a
strange
attractive
folly
in
itself
partly
a
serious
ideal
which
indeed
is
huysmans
own
partly
the
caricature
of
that
ideal
des
esseintes
though
studied
from
a
real
man
who
is
known
to
those
who
know
a
certain
kind
of
society
in
paris
is
a
type
rather
than
a
man
he
is
the
offspring
of
the
decadent
art
that
he
adores
and
this
book
a
sort
of
breviary
for
its
worshippers
it
has
a
place
of
its
own
in
the
literature
of
the
day
for
it
sums
up
not
only
a
talent
but
a
spiritual
epoch
is
a
book
that
can
only
be
written
once
and
since
that
date
huysmans
has
published
a
short
story
which
is
merely
a
somewhat
lengthy
anecdote
two
novels
and
both
of
which
are
interesting
experiments
but
neither
of
them
an
entire
success
and
a
volume
of
art
criticism
notable
for
a
single
splendid
essay
that
on
félicien
rops
the
etcher
of
the
fantastically
erotic
is
a
sort
of
deliberately
exaggerated
record
vision
rather
then
record
of
the
disillusions
of
a
country
sojourn
as
they
affect
the
disordered
nerves
of
a
town
the
narrative
is
punctuated
by
nightmares
marvellously
woven
out
of
nothing
and
with
no
psychological
value
the
human
part
of
the
book
being
a
sort
of
picturesque
pathology
at
best
the
representation
of
a
series
of
states
of
nerves
sharpened
by
the
tragic
ennui
of
the
country
there
is
a
cat
which
becomes
interesting
in
its
agonies
but
the
long
boredom
of
the
man
and
woman
is
only
too
faithfully
shared
with
the
reader
is
a
more
artistic
creation
on
a
more
solid
foundation
it
is
a
study
of
satanism
a
dexterous
interweaving
of
the
history
of
gilles
de
retz
the
traditional
bluebeard
with
the
contemporary
manifestations
of
the
black
art
the
execration
of
impotence
the
hate
of
the
mediocre
that
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
indulgent
definitions
of
diabolism
says
huysmans
somewhere
in
the
book
and
it
is
on
this
side
that
one
finds
the
link
of
connection
with
the
others
of
that
series
of
pessimist
studies
in
life
naturalisme
spiritualiste
he
defines
his
own
art
at
this
point
in
its
development
and
it
is
in
somewhat
the
documentary
manner
that
he
applies
himself
to
the
study
of
these
strange
problems
half
of
hysteria
half
of
a
real
mystical
corruption
that
does
actually
exist
in
our
midst
i
do
not
know
whether
the
monstrous
tableau
of
the
black
mass
so
marvellously
so
revoltingly
described
in
the
central
episode
of
the
book
is
still
enacted
in
our
days
but
i
do
know
that
all
but
the
most
horrible
practices
of
the
sacrilegious
magic
of
the
middle
ages
are
yet
performed
from
time
to
time
in
a
secrecy
which
is
all
but
absolute
the
character
of
madame
chantelouve
is
an
attempt
probably
the
first
in
literature
to
diagnose
a
case
of
sadism
in
a
woman
to
say
that
it
is
successful
would
be
to
assume
that
the
thing
is
possible
which
one
hesitates
to
do
the
book
is
even
more
disquieting
to
the
normal
mind
than
but
it
is
not
like
that
the
study
of
an
exception
which
has
become
a
type
it
is
the
study
of
an
exception
which
does
not
profess
to
be
anything
but
a
disease
huysmans
place
in
contemporary
literature
is
not
quite
easy
to
estimate
there
is
a
danger
of
being
too
much
attracted
or
too
much
repelled
by
those
qualities
of
deliberate
singularity
which
make
his
work
sincere
expression
as
it
is
of
his
own
personality
so
artificial
and
in
itself
with
his
pronounced
exceptional
characteristics
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
write
fiction
impersonally
or
to
range
himself
for
long
in
any
school
under
any
master
interrogated
one
day
as
to
his
opinion
of
naturalism
he
had
but
to
say
in
reply
fond
il
y
a
des
écrivains
qui
out
du
talent
et
qui
out
pas
soient
naturalistes
romantiques
décadents
tout
ce
que
vous
voudrez
ça
égal
il
pour
moi
du
talent
et
voilà
tout
but
as
we
have
seen
he
has
undergone
various
influences
he
has
had
his
periods
from
the
first
he
has
had
a
style
of
singular
pungency
novelty
and
colour
and
even
in
drageoir
à
epices
we
find
such
daring
combinations
as
this
camaïeu
rouge
cette
fanfare
de
rouge
cette
gamme
intensité
furieuse
violence
inouïe
working
upon
the
foundation
of
flaubert
and
of
goncourt
the
two
great
modern
stylists
he
has
developed
an
intensely
personal
style
of
his
own
in
which
the
sense
of
rhythm
is
entirely
dominated
by
the
sense
of
colour
he
manipulates
the
french
language
with
a
freedom
sometimes
barbarous
dragging
his
images
by
the
heels
or
the
hair
in
the
admirable
phrase
of
léon
bloy
up
and
down
the
staircase
of
terrified
syntax
gaining
certainly
the
effects
at
which
he
aims
he
possesses
in
the
highest
degree
that
tacheté
et
and
spotted
with
corruption
that
he
attributes
to
goncourt
and
verlaine
and
with
this
audacious
and
barbaric
profusion
of
words
chosen
always
for
their
colour
and
their
vividly
expressive
quality
he
is
able
to
describe
the
essentially
modern
aspects
of
things
as
no
one
had
ever
described
them
before
no
one
before
him
had
ever
so
realised
the
perverse
charm
of
the
sordid
the
perverse
charm
of
the
artificial
exceptional
always
it
is
for
such
qualities
as
these
rather
than
for
the
ordinary
qualities
of
the
novelist
that
he
is
remarkable
his
stories
are
without
incident
they
are
constructed
to
go
on
until
they
stop
they
are
almost
without
characters
his
psychology
is
a
matter
of
the
sensations
and
chiefly
the
visual
sensations
the
moral
nature
is
ignored
the
emotions
resolve
themselves
for
the
most
part
into
a
sordid
ennui
rising
at
times
into
a
rage
at
existence
the
protagonist
of
every
book
is
not
so
much
a
character
as
a
bundle
of
impressions
and
sensations
the
vague
outline
of
a
single
consciousness
his
own
but
it
is
that
single
consciousness
in
this
morbidly
personal
writer
with
which
we
are
concerned
for
huysmans
novels
with
all
their
strangeness
their
charm
their
repulsion
typical
too
as
they
are
of
much
beside
himself
are
certainly
the
expression
of
a
personality
as
remarkable
as
that
of
any
contemporary
writer
ii
the
later
huysmans
in
the
preface
to
his
first
novel
histoire
fille
thirty
years
ago
huysmans
defined
his
theory
of
art
in
this
defiant
phrase
i
write
what
i
see
what
i
feel
and
what
i
have
experienced
and
i
write
it
as
well
as
i
can
that
is
all
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
he
could
still
say
in
answer
to
an
interviewer
who
asked
him
his
opinion
of
naturalism
at
bottom
there
are
writers
who
have
talent
and
others
who
have
not
let
them
be
naturalists
romantics
decadents
what
you
will
it
is
all
the
same
to
me
i
only
want
to
know
if
they
have
talent
such
theoretical
liberality
in
a
writer
of
original
talent
is
a
little
disconcerting
it
means
that
he
is
without
a
theory
of
his
own
that
he
is
not
yet
conscious
of
having
chosen
his
own
way
and
indeed
it
is
only
with
that
huysmans
can
be
said
to
have
discovered
the
direction
in
which
he
had
really
been
travelling
from
the
beginning
in
a
preface
written
not
long
since
for
a
limited
edition
of
rebours
huysmans
confessed
that
he
had
never
been
conscious
of
the
direction
in
which
he
was
travelling
my
life
and
my
literature
he
affirmed
have
undoubtedly
a
certain
amount
of
passivity
of
the
incalculable
of
a
direction
not
mine
i
have
simply
obeyed
i
have
been
led
by
what
are
called
ways
he
is
speaking
of
the
conversion
which
took
him
to
la
trappe
in
but
the
words
apply
to
the
whole
course
of
his
career
as
a
man
of
letters
in
which
is
a
sort
of
false
start
he
had
indeed
realised
though
for
himself
at
that
time
ineffectually
that
it
is
essential
to
preserve
the
veracity
of
the
document
the
precision
of
detail
the
fibrous
and
nervous
language
of
realism
but
it
is
equally
essential
to
become
the
of
the
soul
and
not
to
attempt
to
explain
what
is
mysterious
by
mental
maladies
it
is
essential
in
a
word
to
follow
the
great
road
so
deeply
dug
out
by
zola
but
it
is
necessary
also
to
trace
a
parallel
pathway
in
the
air
and
to
grapple
with
the
within
and
the
after
to
create
in
a
word
a
spiritual
naturalism
this
is
almost
a
definition
of
the
art
of
route
where
this
spiritual
realism
is
applied
to
the
history
of
a
soul
a
consciousness
in
the
method
has
still
further
developed
and
huysmans
becomes
in
his
own
way
a
symbolist
to
the
student
of
psychology
few
more
interesting
cases
could
be
presented
than
the
development
of
huysmans
from
the
first
he
has
been
a
man
for
whom
the
visible
world
existed
indeed
but
as
the
scene
of
a
slow
martyrdom
the
world
has
always
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
profoundly
uncomfortable
unpleasant
and
ridiculous
place
and
it
has
been
a
necessity
of
his
temperament
to
examine
it
minutely
with
all
the
patience
of
disgust
and
a
necessity
of
his
method
to
record
it
with
an
almost
ecstatic
hatred
in
his
first
book
drageoir
à
epices
published
at
the
age
of
we
find
him
seeking
his
colour
by
preference
in
a
drunkard
cheek
or
a
carcase
outside
a
butcher
shop
published
at
brussels
in
anticipates
fille
and
but
it
has
a
crude
brutality
of
observation
in
which
there
is
hardly
a
touch
of
pity
sœurs
is
a
frame
without
a
picture
but
in
the
dreary
tedium
of
existence
is
chronicled
in
all
its
insignificance
with
a
kind
of
weary
and
aching
hate
we
too
is
its
conclusion
by
leave
of
the
everlasting
stupidity
of
things
may
like
our
live
stupid
and
respected
the
fantastic
unreality
the
exquisite
artificiality
of
rebours
the
breviary
of
the
decadence
is
the
first
sign
of
that
possible
escape
which
huysmans
has
always
foreseen
in
the
direction
of
art
but
which
he
is
still
unable
to
make
into
more
than
an
artificial
paradise
in
which
beauty
turns
to
a
cruel
hallucination
and
imprisons
the
soul
still
more
fatally
the
end
is
a
cry
of
hopeless
hope
in
which
huysmans
did
not
understand
the
meaning
till
later
lord
have
pity
of
the
christian
who
doubts
of
the
sceptic
who
would
fain
believe
of
the
convict
of
life
who
sets
sail
alone
by
night
under
a
firmament
lighted
only
by
the
consoling
of
the
old
hope
in
we
are
in
yet
another
stage
of
this
strange
progress
the
disgust
which
once
manifested
itself
in
the
merely
external
revolt
against
the
ugliness
of
streets
the
imbecility
of
faces
has
become
more
and
more
internalised
and
the
attraction
of
what
is
perverse
in
the
unusual
beauty
of
art
has
led
by
some
obscure
route
to
the
perilous
halfway
house
of
a
corrupt
mysticism
the
book
with
its
monstrous
pictures
of
the
black
mass
and
of
the
spiritual
abominations
of
satanism
is
one
step
further
in
the
direction
of
the
supernatural
and
this
too
has
its
desperate
conclusion
christian
glory
is
a
to
our
age
it
contaminates
the
supernatural
and
casts
out
the
world
to
come
in
we
go
down
into
the
deepest
gulf
sets
us
one
stage
along
a
new
way
and
at
this
begins
the
later
huysmans
the
old
conception
of
the
novel
as
an
amusing
tale
of
adventures
though
it
has
still
its
apologists
in
england
has
long
since
ceased
in
france
to
mean
anything
more
actual
than
powdered
wigs
and
lace
ruffles
like
children
who
cry
to
their
elders
for
a
story
a
story
the
english
public
still
wants
its
plot
its
heroine
its
villain
that
the
novel
should
be
psychological
was
a
discovery
as
early
as
benjamin
constant
whose
anticipates
rouge
et
le
noir
that
rare
revealing
yet
somewhat
arid
masterpiece
of
stendhal
but
that
psychology
could
be
carried
so
far
into
the
darkness
of
the
soul
that
the
flaming
walls
of
the
world
themselves
faded
to
a
glimmer
was
a
discovery
which
had
been
made
by
no
novelist
before
huysmans
wrote
at
once
the
novel
showed
itself
capable
of
competing
on
their
own
ground
with
poetry
with
the
great
confessions
with
philosophy
is
perhaps
the
first
novel
which
does
not
et
out
with
the
aim
of
amusing
its
readers
it
offers
you
no
more
entertainment
than
or
the
of
augustine
and
it
is
possible
to
consider
it
on
the
same
level
the
novel
which
after
having
chronicled
the
adventures
of
the
vanity
fairs
of
this
world
has
set
itself
with
admirable
success
to
analyse
the
amorous
and
ambitious
and
intelligence
of
the
conscious
and
practical
self
sets
itself
at
last
to
the
final
achievement
the
revelation
of
the
self
no
longer
the
intelligence
but
the
soul
here
then
purged
of
the
distraction
of
incident
liberated
from
the
bondage
of
a
too
realistic
conversation
in
which
the
aim
had
been
to
convey
the
very
gesture
of
breathing
life
internalised
to
a
complete
liberty
in
which
just
because
it
is
so
absolutely
free
art
is
able
to
accept
without
limiting
itself
the
expressive
medium
of
a
convention
we
have
in
the
novel
a
new
form
which
may
be
at
once
a
confession
and
a
decoration
the
soul
and
a
pattern
this
story
of
a
conversion
is
a
new
thing
in
modern
french
it
is
a
confession
a
of
the
soul
a
kind
of
thinking
aloud
it
fixes
in
precise
words
all
the
uncertainties
the
contradictions
the
absurd
unreasonableness
and
not
less
absurd
logic
which
distract
man
brain
in
the
passing
over
him
of
sensation
and
circumstance
and
all
this
thinking
is
concentrated
on
one
end
is
concerned
with
the
working
out
in
his
own
singular
way
of
one
man
salvation
there
is
a
certain
dry
hard
casuistry
a
subtlety
and
closeness
almost
ecclesiastical
in
the
investigation
of
an
obscure
and
yet
definite
region
whose
intellectual
passions
are
as
varied
and
as
tumultuous
as
those
of
the
heart
every
step
is
taken
deliberately
is
weighed
approved
condemned
viewed
from
this
side
and
from
that
and
at
the
same
time
one
feels
behind
all
this
reasoning
an
impulsion
urging
a
soul
onward
against
its
will
in
this
astonishing
passage
through
satanism
to
faith
in
which
the
cry
i
am
so
weary
of
myself
so
sick
of
my
miserable
existence
echoes
through
page
after
page
until
despair
dies
into
conviction
the
conviction
of
the
uselessness
of
concerning
oneself
about
anything
but
mysticism
and
the
liturgy
of
thinking
about
anything
but
about
god
it
is
impossible
not
to
see
the
sincerity
of
an
actual
unique
experience
the
force
of
mere
curiosity
can
go
far
can
penetrate
to
a
certain
depth
yet
there
is
a
point
at
which
mere
curiosity
even
that
of
genius
comes
to
an
end
and
we
are
left
to
the
individual
soul
apprehension
of
what
seems
to
it
the
reality
of
spiritual
things
such
a
personal
apprehension
comes
to
us
out
of
this
book
and
at
the
same
time
just
as
in
the
days
when
he
forced
language
to
express
in
a
more
coloured
and
pictorial
way
than
it
had
ever
expressed
before
the
last
escaping
details
of
material
things
so
in
this
analysis
of
the
aberrations
and
warfares
the
confessions
and
trials
of
the
soul
in
penitence
huysmans
has
found
words
for
even
the
most
subtle
and
illusive
aspects
of
that
inner
life
which
he
has
come
at
the
last
to
apprehend
in
we
are
still
occupied
with
this
sensitive
lethargic
persevering
soul
but
with
that
soul
in
one
of
its
longest
halts
by
the
way
as
it
undergoes
the
slow
permeating
influence
of
la
cathédrale
mystique
par
excellence
the
cathedral
of
chartres
and
the
greater
part
of
the
book
is
taken
up
with
a
study
of
this
cathedral
of
that
elaborate
and
profound
symbolism
by
which
the
soul
of
sanctuaries
slowly
reveals
itself
quel
laconisme
hermétique
with
a
sort
of
parallel
interpretation
of
the
symbolism
which
the
church
of
the
middle
ages
concealed
or
revealed
in
colours
precious
stones
plants
animals
numbers
odours
and
in
the
bible
itself
in
the
setting
together
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
no
doubt
to
some
extent
this
book
is
less
interesting
than
route
in
the
exact
proportion
in
which
everything
in
the
world
is
less
interesting
than
the
human
soul
there
are
times
when
durtal
is
almost
forgotten
and
unjustly
enough
it
may
seem
as
if
we
are
given
this
archæology
these
bestiaries
for
their
own
sake
to
fall
into
this
error
is
to
mistake
the
whole
purpose
of
the
book
the
whole
extent
of
the
discovery
in
art
which
huysmans
has
been
one
of
the
first
to
make
for
in
huysmans
does
but
carry
further
the
principle
which
he
had
perceived
in
route
showing
as
he
does
how
inert
matter
the
art
of
stones
the
growth
of
plants
the
unconscious
life
of
beasts
may
be
brought
under
the
same
law
of
the
soul
may
obtain
through
symbol
a
spiritual
existence
he
is
thus
but
extending
the
domain
of
the
soul
while
he
may
seem
to
be
limiting
or
ignoring
it
and
durtal
may
well
stand
aside
for
a
moment
in
at
least
the
energy
of
contemplation
while
he
sees
with
a
new
understanding
the
very
sight
of
his
eyes
the
very
staff
of
his
thoughts
taking
life
before
him
a
life
of
the
same
substance
as
his
own
what
is
symbolism
if
not
an
establishing
of
the
links
which
hold
the
world
together
the
affirmation
of
an
eternal
minute
intricate
almost
invisible
life
which
runs
through
the
whole
universe
every
age
has
its
own
symbols
but
a
symbol
once
perfectly
expressed
that
symbol
remains
as
gothic
architecture
remains
the
very
soul
of
the
middle
ages
to
get
at
that
truth
which
is
all
but
the
deepest
meaning
of
beauty
to
find
that
symbol
which
is
its
most
adequate
expression
is
in
itself
a
kind
of
creation
and
that
is
what
huysmans
does
for
us
in
more
and
more
he
has
put
aside
all
the
profane
and
accessible
and
outward
pomp
of
writing
for
an
inner
and
more
severe
beauty
of
perfect
truth
he
has
come
to
realise
that
truth
can
be
reached
and
revealed
only
by
symbol
hence
all
that
description
that
heaping
up
of
detail
that
passionately
patient
elaboration
all
means
to
an
end
not
as
you
may
hastily
incline
to
think
ends
in
themselves
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
often
an
artist
perfects
a
particular
means
of
expression
long
before
he
has
any
notion
of
what
to
do
with
it
huysmans
began
by
acquiring
so
astonishing
a
mastery
of
description
that
he
could
describe
the
inside
of
a
cow
hanging
in
a
butcher
shop
as
beautifully
as
if
it
were
a
casket
of
jewels
the
little
of
his
early
novels
were
taken
for
long
walks
in
which
they
would
have
seen
nothing
but
the
arm
on
which
they
leant
and
the
shops
which
they
passed
and
what
they
did
not
see
was
described
marvellously
in
twenty
pages
huysmans
is
a
brain
all
eye
a
brain
which
sees
even
ideas
as
if
they
had
a
superficies
his
style
is
always
the
same
whether
he
writes
of
a
butcher
shop
or
of
a
window
it
is
the
immediate
expression
of
a
way
of
seeing
so
minute
and
so
intense
that
it
becomes
too
emphatic
for
elegance
and
too
coloured
for
atmosphere
or
composition
always
ready
to
sacrifice
euphony
to
either
fact
or
colour
he
cares
only
to
give
you
the
thing
seen
exactly
as
he
sees
it
with
all
his
love
or
hate
and
with
all
the
exaggeration
which
that
feeling
brings
into
it
and
he
loves
beauty
as
a
bulldog
loves
its
mistress
by
growling
at
all
her
enemies
he
honours
wisdom
by
annihilating
stupidity
his
art
of
painting
in
words
resembles
art
of
painting
with
his
brush
there
is
the
same
power
of
rendering
a
vivid
effect
almost
deceptively
with
a
crude
and
yet
sensitive
realism
pour
la
gourmandise
de
un
gala
de
teintes
he
says
of
the
provision
cellars
at
hamburg
and
this
greed
of
the
eye
has
eaten
up
in
him
almost
every
other
sense
even
of
music
he
writes
as
a
deaf
man
with
an
eye
for
colour
might
write
to
whom
a
musician
had
explained
certain
technical
means
of
expression
in
music
no
one
has
ever
invented
such
barbarous
and
exact
metaphors
for
the
rendering
of
visual
sensations
properly
there
is
no
metaphor
the
words
say
exactly
what
they
mean
they
become
figurative
as
we
call
it
in
their
insistence
on
being
themselves
fact
huysmans
knows
that
the
motive
force
of
the
sentence
lies
in
the
verbs
and
his
verbs
are
the
most
singular
precise
and
expressive
in
any
language
but
in
subordinating
as
he
does
every
quality
to
that
of
sharp
telling
truth
the
truth
of
extremes
his
style
loses
charm
yet
it
can
be
dazzling
it
has
the
solidity
of
those
walls
encrusted
with
gems
which
are
to
be
seen
in
a
certain
chapel
in
prague
it
blazes
with
colour
and
arabesques
into
a
thousand
fantastic
patterns
and
now
all
that
laboriously
acquired
mastery
finds
at
last
its
use
lending
itself
to
the
new
spirit
with
a
wonderful
docility
at
last
the
idea
which
is
beyond
reality
has
been
found
not
where
des
esseintes
sought
it
and
a
new
meaning
comes
into
what
had
once
been
scarcely
more
than
patient
and
wrathful
observation
the
idea
is
there
visible
in
his
cathedral
like
the
sun
which
flashes
into
unity
into
meaning
into
intelligible
beauty
the
bewildering
lozenges
of
colour
the
inextricable
trails
of
lead
which
go
to
make
up
the
picture
in
one
of
its
painted
windows
what
for
instance
could
be
more
precise
in
its
translation
of
the
different
aspects
under
which
the
cathedral
of
chartres
can
be
seen
merely
as
colour
than
this
one
sentence
seen
as
a
whole
under
a
clear
sky
its
grey
silvers
and
if
the
sun
shines
upon
it
turns
pale
yellow
and
then
golden
seen
close
its
skin
is
like
that
of
a
nibbled
biscuit
with
its
silicious
limestone
eaten
into
holes
sometimes
when
the
sun
is
setting
it
turns
crimson
and
rises
up
like
a
monstrous
and
delicate
shrine
rose
and
green
and
at
twilight
turns
blue
then
seems
to
evaporate
as
it
fades
into
violet
or
again
in
a
passage
which
comes
nearer
to
the
conventional
idea
of
eloquence
how
absolute
an
avoidance
of
a
conventional
phrase
a
word
used
for
its
merely
oratorical
value
high
up
in
space
like
salamanders
human
beings
with
burning
faces
and
flaming
robes
lived
in
a
firmament
of
fire
but
these
conflagrations
were
circumscribed
limited
by
an
incombustible
frame
of
darker
glass
which
beat
back
the
clear
young
joy
of
the
flames
by
that
kind
of
melancholy
that
more
serious
and
more
aged
aspect
which
is
taken
by
the
duller
colours
the
hue
and
cry
of
reds
the
limpid
security
of
whites
the
reiterated
halleluias
of
yellows
the
virginal
glory
of
blues
all
the
quivering
of
painted
glass
dies
away
as
it
came
near
this
border
coloured
with
the
rust
of
iron
with
the
russet
of
sauce
with
the
harsh
violet
of
sandstone
with
with
the
brown
of
touchwood
with
sooty
black
with
ashen
grey
this
in
its
excess
of
exactitude
how
mediæval
a
quality
becomes
on
one
page
a
comparison
of
the
tower
without
a
spire
to
an
unsharpened
pencil
which
can
not
write
the
prayers
of
earth
upon
the
sky
but
for
the
most
part
it
is
a
consistent
humanising
of
too
objectively
visible
things
a
disengaging
of
the
sentiment
which
exists
in
them
which
is
one
of
the
secrets
of
their
appeal
to
us
but
which
for
the
most
part
we
overlook
as
we
set
ourselves
to
add
up
the
shapes
and
colours
which
have
enchanted
us
to
huysmans
this
artistic
discovery
has
come
perhaps
in
the
most
effectual
way
but
certainly
in
the
way
least
probable
in
these
days
through
faith
a
definite
religious
faith
so
that
beginning
tentatively
he
has
come
at
last
to
believe
in
the
catholic
church
as
a
monk
of
the
middle
ages
believed
in
it
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
to
huysmans
this
abandonment
to
religion
has
brought
among
other
gifts
a
certain
human
charity
in
which
he
was
notably
lacking
removing
at
once
one
of
his
artistic
limitations
it
has
softened
his
contempt
of
humanity
it
has
broadened
his
outlook
on
the
world
and
the
sense
diffused
through
the
whole
of
this
book
of
the
living
and
beneficent
reality
of
the
virgin
of
her
real
presence
in
the
cathedral
built
in
her
honour
and
after
her
own
image
brings
a
strange
and
touching
kind
of
poetry
into
these
closely
and
soberly
woven
pages
from
this
time
forward
until
his
death
huysmans
is
seen
purging
himself
of
his
realism
coming
closer
and
closer
to
that
spiritual
naturalism
which
he
had
invented
an
art
made
out
of
an
apprehension
of
the
inner
meaning
of
those
things
which
he
still
saw
with
the
old
tenacity
of
vision
nothing
is
changed
in
him
and
yet
all
is
changed
the
disgust
of
the
world
deepens
through
which
is
the
last
stage
but
one
in
the
pilgrimage
which
begins
with
it
seeks
an
escape
in
poring
with
a
dreadful
diligence
over
a
recorded
miracles
in
the
life
of
lydwine
de
schiedam
which
is
mediæval
in
its
precise
acceptance
of
every
horrible
detail
of
the
story
foules
de
has
the
same
minute
attentiveness
to
horror
but
with
a
new
pity
in
it
and
a
way
of
giving
thanks
to
the
virgin
which
is
in
huysmans
yet
another
escape
from
his
disgust
of
the
world
but
it
is
in
the
great
chapter
on
satan
as
the
creator
of
ugliness
that
his
work
seems
to
end
where
it
had
begun
in
the
service
of
art
now
come
from
a
great
way
off
to
join
itself
with
the
service
of
god
and
the
whole
soul
of
huysmans
characterises
itself
in
the
turn
of
a
single
phrase
there
that
art
is
the
only
clean
thing
on
earth
except
holiness
arthur
rimbaud
that
story
of
the
arabian
nights
which
is
at
the
same
time
a
true
story
the
life
of
rimbaud
has
been
told
for
the
first
time
in
the
extravagant
but
valuable
book
of
an
anarchist
of
letters
who
writes
under
the
name
of
paterne
berrichon
and
who
has
since
married
rimbaud
sister
vie
de
is
full
of
curiosity
for
those
who
have
been
mystified
by
i
know
not
what
legends
invented
to
give
wonder
to
a
career
itself
more
wonderful
than
any
of
the
inventions
the
man
who
died
at
marseilles
at
the
hospital
of
the
conception
on
march
at
the
age
of
as
the
register
of
his
death
describes
him
was
a
writer
of
genius
an
innovator
in
verse
and
prose
who
had
written
all
his
poetry
by
the
age
of
nineteen
and
all
his
prose
by
a
year
or
two
later
he
had
given
up
literature
to
travel
hither
and
thither
first
in
europe
then
in
africa
he
had
been
an
engineer
a
leader
of
caravans
a
merchant
of
precious
merchandise
and
this
man
who
had
never
written
down
a
line
after
those
astonishing
early
experiments
was
heard
in
his
last
delirium
talking
of
precisely
such
visions
as
those
which
had
haunted
his
youth
and
using
says
his
sister
expressions
of
a
singular
and
penetrating
charm
to
render
these
sensations
of
visionary
countries
here
certainly
is
one
of
the
most
curious
problems
of
literature
is
it
a
problem
of
which
we
can
discover
the
secret
rimbaud
was
born
at
charleville
in
the
ardennes
october
his
father
of
whom
he
saw
little
was
a
captain
in
the
army
his
mother
of
peasant
origin
was
severe
rigid
and
unsympathetic
at
school
he
was
an
unwilling
but
brilliant
scholar
and
by
his
fifteenth
year
was
well
acquainted
with
latin
literature
and
intimately
with
french
literature
it
was
in
that
year
that
he
began
to
write
poems
from
the
first
curiously
original
eleven
poems
dating
from
that
year
are
to
be
found
in
his
collected
works
when
he
was
sixteen
he
decided
that
he
had
had
enough
of
school
and
enough
of
home
only
paris
existed
he
must
go
to
paris
the
first
time
he
went
without
a
ticket
he
spent
indeed
fifteen
days
in
paris
but
he
spent
them
in
mazas
from
which
he
was
released
and
restored
to
his
home
by
his
schoolmaster
the
second
time
a
few
days
later
he
sold
his
watch
which
paid
for
his
railway
ticket
this
time
he
threw
himself
on
the
hospitality
of
andré
gill
a
painter
and
of
some
little
notoriety
then
whose
address
he
had
happened
to
come
across
the
uninvited
guest
was
not
welcomed
and
after
some
penniless
days
in
paris
he
tramped
back
to
charleville
the
third
time
he
had
waited
five
months
writing
poems
and
discontented
to
be
only
writing
poems
he
made
his
way
to
paris
on
foot
in
a
heat
of
revolutionary
sympathy
to
offer
himself
to
the
insurgents
of
the
commune
again
he
had
to
return
on
foot
finally
having
learnt
with
difficulty
that
a
man
is
not
taken
at
his
own
valuation
until
he
has
proved
his
right
to
be
so
accepted
he
sent
up
the
manuscript
of
his
poems
to
verlaine
the
manuscript
contained
bateau
ivre
les
premières
communions
ma
bohème
roman
les
effarés
and
indeed
all
but
a
few
of
the
poems
he
ever
wrote
verlaine
was
overwhelmed
with
delight
and
invited
him
to
paris
a
local
admirer
lent
him
the
money
to
get
there
and
from
october
to
july
he
was
verlaine
guest
the
boy
of
seventeen
already
a
perfectly
original
poet
and
beginning
to
be
an
equally
original
astonished
the
whole
parnasse
banville
hugo
himself
on
verlaine
his
influence
was
more
profound
the
meeting
brought
about
one
of
those
lamentable
and
admirable
disasters
which
make
and
unmake
careers
verlaine
has
told
us
in
his
that
in
the
beginning
there
was
no
question
of
any
sort
of
affection
or
sympathy
between
two
natures
so
different
as
that
of
the
poet
of
the
and
mine
but
simply
of
an
extreme
admiration
and
astonishment
before
this
boy
of
sixteen
who
had
already
written
things
as
fénéon
has
excellently
said
outside
literature
this
admiration
and
astonishment
passed
gradually
into
a
more
personal
feeling
and
it
was
under
the
influence
of
rimbaud
that
the
long
vagabondage
of
verlaine
life
began
the
two
poets
wandered
together
through
belgium
england
and
again
belgium
from
july
to
august
when
there
occurred
that
tragic
parting
at
brussels
which
left
verlaine
a
prisoner
for
eighteen
months
and
sent
rimbaud
back
to
his
family
he
had
already
written
all
the
poetry
and
prose
that
he
was
ever
to
write
and
in
he
printed
at
brussels
saison
en
it
was
the
only
book
he
himself
ever
gave
to
the
press
and
no
sooner
was
it
printed
than
he
destroyed
the
whole
edition
with
the
exception
of
a
few
copies
of
which
only
copy
i
believe
still
exists
soon
began
new
wanderings
with
their
invariable
return
to
the
of
charleville
a
few
days
in
paris
a
year
in
england
four
months
in
stuttgart
where
he
was
visited
by
verlaine
italy
france
again
vienna
java
holland
sweden
egypt
cyprus
abyssinia
and
then
nothing
but
africa
until
the
final
return
to
france
he
had
been
a
teacher
of
french
in
england
a
seller
of
in
the
streets
of
paris
had
unloaded
vessels
in
the
ports
and
helped
to
gather
in
the
harvest
in
the
country
he
had
been
a
volunteer
in
the
dutch
army
a
military
engineer
a
trader
and
now
physical
sciences
had
begun
to
attract
his
insatiable
curiosity
and
dreams
of
the
fabulous
east
began
to
resolve
themselves
into
dreams
of
a
romantic
commerce
with
the
real
east
he
became
a
merchant
of
coffee
perfumes
ivory
and
gold
in
the
interior
of
africa
then
an
explorer
a
predecessor
and
in
his
own
regions
of
marchand
after
twelve
years
wandering
and
exposure
in
africa
he
was
attacked
by
a
malady
of
the
knee
which
rapidly
became
worse
he
was
transported
first
to
aden
then
to
marseilles
where
in
may
his
leg
was
amputated
further
complications
set
in
he
insisted
first
on
being
removed
to
his
home
then
on
being
taken
back
to
marseilles
his
sufferings
were
an
intolerable
torment
and
more
cruel
to
him
was
the
torment
of
his
desire
to
live
he
died
inch
by
inch
fighting
every
inch
and
his
sister
quiet
narrative
of
those
last
months
is
agonising
he
died
at
marseilles
in
november
prophesying
says
his
sister
and
repeating

the
secret
of
rimbaud
i
think
and
the
reason
why
he
was
able
to
do
the
unique
thing
in
literature
which
he
did
and
then
to
disappear
quietly
and
become
a
legend
in
the
east
is
that
his
mind
was
not
the
mind
of
the
artist
but
of
the
man
of
action
he
was
a
dreamer
but
all
his
dreams
were
discoveries
to
him
it
was
an
identical
act
of
his
temperament
to
write
the
sonnet
of
the
and
to
trade
in
ivory
and
frankincense
with
the
arabs
he
lived
with
all
his
faculties
at
every
instant
of
his
life
abandoning
himself
to
himself
with
a
confidence
which
was
at
once
his
strength
and
looking
at
things
less
absolutely
his
weakness
to
the
student
of
success
and
what
is
relative
in
achievement
he
illustrates
the
danger
of
by
one
own
genius
just
as
aptly
as
the
saint
in
the
cloister
does
or
the
mystic
too
full
of
god
to
speak
intelligibly
to
the
world
or
the
spilt
wisdom
of
the
drunkard
the
artist
who
is
above
all
things
an
artist
cultivates
a
little
choice
corner
of
himself
with
elaborate
care
he
brings
miraculous
flowers
to
growth
there
but
the
rest
of
the
garden
is
but
mown
grass
or
tangled
bushes
that
is
why
many
excellent
writers
very
many
painters
and
most
musicians
are
so
tedious
on
any
subject
but
their
own
is
it
not
tempting
does
it
not
seem
a
devotion
rather
than
a
superstition
to
worship
the
golden
chalice
in
which
the
wine
has
been
made
god
as
if
the
chalice
were
the
reality
and
the
real
presence
the
symbol
the
artist
who
is
only
an
artist
circumscribes
his
intelligence
into
almost
such
a
fiction
as
he
reverences
the
work
of
his
own
hands
but
there
are
certain
natures
great
or
small
shakespeare
or
rimbaud
it
makes
no
difference
to
whom
the
work
is
nothing
the
act
of
working
everything
rimbaud
was
a
small
narrow
hard
precipitate
nature
which
had
the
will
to
live
and
nothing
but
the
will
to
live
and
his
verses
and
his
follies
and
his
wanderings
and
his
traffickings
were
but
the
breathing
of
different
hours
in
his
day
that
is
why
he
is
so
swift
definite
and
quickly
exhausted
in
vision
why
he
had
his
few
things
to
say
each
an
action
with
consequences
he
invents
new
ways
of
saying
things
not
because
he
is
a
learned
artist
but
because
he
is
burning
to
say
them
and
he
has
none
of
the
hesitations
of
knowledge
he
leaps
right
over
or
through
the
conventions
that
had
been
standing
in
everybody
way
he
has
no
time
to
go
round
and
no
respect
for
and
so
he
becomes
the
of
literature
playing
pranks
as
in
that
sonnet
of
the
knocking
down
barriers
for
the
mere
amusement
of
the
thing
getting
all
the
possible
advantage
of
his
barbarisms
in
mind
and
conduct
and
so
in
life
he
is
first
of
all
conspicuous
as
a
disorderly
liver
a
révolter
against
morals
as
against
prosody
though
we
may
imagine
that
in
his
heart
morals
meant
as
little
to
him
one
way
or
the
other
as
prosody
later
on
his
revolt
seems
to
be
against
civilisation
itself
as
he
disappears
into
the
deserts
of
africa
and
it
is
if
you
like
a
revolt
against
civilisation
but
the
revolt
is
instinctive
a
need
of
the
organism
it
is
not
doctrinal
cynical
a
conviction
a
sentiment
always
as
he
says
univers
fantastiques
he
is
conscious
of
the
danger
as
well
as
the
ecstasy
of
that
divine
imitation
for
he
says
my
life
will
always
be
too
vast
to
be
given
up
wholly
to
force
and
beauty
dieu
avec
gourmandise
he
cries
in
a
fine
rapture
and
then
sadly
enough
i
have
created
all
the
feasts
all
the
triumphs
all
the
dramas
of
the
world
i
have
set
myself
to
invent
new
flowers
a
new
flesh
a
new
language
i
have
fancied
that
i
have
attained
supernatural
power
well
i
have
now
only
to
put
my
imagination
and
my
memories
in
the
grave
what
a
fine
artist
and
fame
thrown
away
see
how
completely
he
is
conscious
and
how
completely
he
is
at
the
mercy
of
that
hallucinatory
rage
of
vision
vision
to
him
being
always
force
power
creation
which
on
some
of
his
pages
seems
to
become
sheer
madness
and
on
others
a
kind
of
wild
but
absolute
insight
he
will
be
silent
he
tells
us
as
to
all
that
he
contains
within
his
mind
greedy
as
the
sea
for
otherwise
poets
and
visionaries
would
envy
him
his
fantastic
wealth
and
in
that
which
does
not
bear
that
title
in
vain
he
exalts
himself
as
a
kind
of
saviour
he
is
in
the
circle
of
pride
in
dante
hell
and
he
has
lost
all
sense
of
limit
really
believes
himself
to
be
no
one
and
some
one
then
in
the
du
verbe
he
becomes
the
analyst
of
his
own
hallucinations
i
believe
in
all
the
enchantments
he
tells
us
i
invented
the
colour
of
the
vowels
a
black
e
white
i
red
o
blue
u
green
i
regulated
the
form
and
the
movement
of
every
consonant
and
with
instinctive
rhythms
i
flattered
myself
that
i
had
invented
a
poetic
language
accessible
one
day
or
another
to
every
shade
of
meaning
i
reserved
to
myself
the
right
of
translation
coincidence
or
origin
it
has
lately
been
pointed
out
that
rimbaud
may
formerly
have
seen
an
old
abc
book
in
which
the
vowels
are
coloured
for
the
most
part
as
his
are
a
black
e
white
i
red
o
blue
u
green
in
the
little
illustrative
pictures
around
them
some
are
oddly
in
keeping
with
the
image
of
rimbaud
i
accustomed
myself
to
simple
hallucination
i
saw
quite
frankly
a
mosque
in
place
of
a
factory
a
school
of
drums
kept
by
the
angels
on
the
roads
of
heaven
a
at
the
bottom
of
a
lake
monsters
mysteries
the
title
of
a
vaudeville
raised
up
horrors
before
me
then
i
explained
my
magical
sophisms
by
the
hallucination
of
words
i
ended
by
finding
something
sacred
in
the
disorder
of
my
mind
then
he
makes
the
great
discovery
action
one
sees
this
fraudulent
and
insistent
will
to
live
has
been
at
the
root
of
all
these
mental
and
verbal
orgies
in
which
he
has
been
wasting
the
very
substance
of
his
thought
well
action
he
discovers
is
not
life
but
a
way
of
spoiling
something
even
this
is
a
form
of
enervation
and
must
be
rejected
from
the
absolute
devoir
remis
il
ne
faut
plus
songer
à
cela
je
suis
réellement
et
pas
de
it
is
for
the
absolute
that
he
seeks
always
the
absolute
which
the
great
artist
with
his
careful
wisdom
has
renounced
seeking
and
he
is
content
with
nothing
less
hence
his
own
contempt
for
what
he
has
done
after
all
so
easily
for
what
has
come
to
him
perhaps
through
his
impatience
but
imperfectly
he
is
a
dreamer
in
whom
dream
is
swift
hard
in
outline
coming
suddenly
and
going
suddenly
a
real
thing
but
seen
only
in
passing
visions
rush
past
him
he
can
not
arrest
them
they
rush
forth
from
him
he
can
not
restrain
their
haste
to
be
gone
as
he
creates
them
in
the
mere
indiscriminate
idleness
of
energy
and
so
this
seeker
after
the
absolute
leaves
but
a
broken
medley
of
fragments
into
each
of
which
he
has
put
a
little
of
his
personality
which
he
is
forever
dramatising
by
multiplying
one
facet
so
to
speak
after
another
very
genuinely
he
is
now
a
beaten
and
wandering
ship
flying
in
a
sort
of
intoxication
before
the
wind
over
undiscovered
seas
now
a
starving
child
outside
a
baker
window
in
the
very
ecstasy
of
hunger
now

at

invents
a
sort
of
before
any
one
else
not
quite
knowing
what
to
do
with
it
invents
a
quite
new
way
of
writing
prose
which
laforgue
will
turn
to
account
later
on
and
having
suggested
with
some
impatience
half
the
things
that
his
own
and
the
next
generation
are
to
busy
themselves
with
developing
he
gives
up
writing
as
an
inadequate
form
to
which
he
is
also
inadequate
what
then
is
the
actual
value
of
rimbaud
work
in
verse
and
prose
apart
from
its
relative
values
of
so
many
kinds
i
think
considerable
though
it
will
probably
come
to
rest
on
two
or
three
pieces
of
verse
and
a
still
vaguer
accomplishment
in
prose
he
brought
into
french
verse
something
of
that
gipsy
way
of
going
with
nature
as
with
a
woman
a
very
young
very
crude
very
defiant
and
sometimes
very
masterly
sense
of
just
these
real
things
which
are
too
close
to
us
to
be
seen
by
most
people
with
any
clearness
he
could
render
physical
sensation
of
the
subtlest
kind
without
making
any
compromise
with
language
forcing
language
to
speak
straight
taming
it
as
one
would
tame
a
dangerous
animal
and
he
kneaded
prose
as
he
kneaded
verse
making
it
a
disarticulated
abstract
mathematically
lyrical
thing
in
verse
he
pointed
the
way
to
certain
new
splendours
as
to
certain
new
there
is
the
ivre
without
which
we
might
never
have
had
verlaine
and
intertangled
with
what
is
ingenuous
and
with
what
is
splendid
there
is
a
certain
irony
which
comes
into
that
youthful
work
as
if
youth
were
already
reminiscent
of
itself
so
conscious
is
it
that
youth
is
youth
and
that
youth
is
passing
in
all
these
ways
rimbaud
had
his
influence
upon
verlaine
and
his
influence
upon
verlaine
was
above
all
the
influence
of
the
man
of
action
upon
the
man
of
sensation
the
influence
of
what
is
simple
narrow
emphatic
upon
what
is
subtle
complex
growing
rich
sensitive
nature
was
just
then
trying
to
realise
itself
just
because
it
had
such
delicate
possibilities
because
there
were
so
many
directions
in
which
it
could
grow
it
was
not
at
first
quite
sure
of
its
way
rimbaud
came
into
the
life
and
art
of
verlaine
troubling
both
with
that
trouble
which
reveals
a
man
to
himself
having
helped
to
make
verlaine
a
great
poet
he
could
go
note
that
he
himself
could
never
have
developed
writing
had
been
one
of
his
discoveries
he
could
but
make
other
discoveries
personal
ones
even
in
literature
he
had
his
future
but
his
future
was
verlaine
here
is
the
famous
sonnet
which
must
be
taken
as
it
was
meant
without
undue
seriousness
and
yet
as
something
more
than
a
mere

more
than
any

has
realised
to
the

the
old
cadences
the
old
eloquence
the
ingenuous
seriousness
of
poetry
are
all
banished
on
a
theory
as
as
that
which
permitted
degas
to
dispense
with
recognisable
beauty
in
his
figures
here
if
ever
is
modern
verse
verse
which
dispenses
with
so
many
of
the
privileges
of
poetry
for
an
ideal
quite
of
its
own
it
is
after
all
a
very
ideal
becoming
artificial
through
its
extreme
naturalness
for
in
poetry
it
is
not
natural
to
say
things
quite
so
much
in
the
manner
of
the
moment
with
however
ironical
an
intention
the
prose
of
the
is
perhaps
even
more
of
a
discovery
finding
its
origin
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
the
experimental
prose
of
rimbaud
it
carries
that
manner
to
a
singular
perfection
disarticulated
abstract
mathematically
lyrical
it
gives
expression
in
its
icy
ecstasy
to
a
very
subtle
criticism
of
the
universe
with
a
surprising
irony
of
cosmical
vision
we
learn
from
books
of
mediæval
magic
that
the
embraces
of
the
devil
are
of
a
coldness
so
intense
that
it
may
be
called
by
an
allowable
figure
of
speech
fiery
everything
may
be
as
strongly
its
opposite
as
itself
and
that
is
why
this
balanced
chill
colloquial
style
of
laforgue
has
in
the
paradox
of
its
intensity
the
essential
heat
of
the
most
obviously
emotional
prose
the
prose
is
more
patient
than
the
verse
with
its
more
compassionate
laughter
at
universal
experience
it
can
laugh
as
seriously
as
profoundly
as
in
that
graveyard
monologue
of
hamlet
laforgue
hamlet
who
maeterlinck
ventures
to
say
is
at
moments
more
hamlet
than
the
hamlet
of
shakespeare
let
me
translate
a
few
sentences
from
it

i

years

i
shall
pass
that
way
like
the
others
like
the
others
o

the
misery
of
being
there
no
longer
ah
i
would
like
to
set
out
and
search
all
through
the
world
for
the
most
adamantine
processes
of
embalming
they
too
were
the
little
people
of
history
learning
to
read
trimming
their
nails
lighting
the
dirty
lamp
every
evening
in
love
gluttonous
vain
fond
of
compliments
handshakes
and
kisses
living
on
gossip
saying

of
weather

really
come
we
have
had

this

ah
everything
is

if
it

not

and
thou
silence
pardon
the
earth
the
little
madcap
hardly
knows
what
she
is
doing
on
the
day
of
the
great
of
consciousness
before
the
ideal
she
will
be
labelled
with
a
pitiful
in
the
column
of
the
miniature
evolutions
of
the
unique
evolution
in
the
column
of
négligeable
quantities
to
die
evidently
one
dies
without
knowing
it
as
every
night
one
enters
upon
sleep
one
has
no
consciousness
of
the
passing
of
the
last
lucid
thought
into
sleep
into
swooning
into
death
evidently
but
to
be
no
more
to
be
here
no
more
to
be
ours
no
more
not
even
to
be
able
any
more
to
press
against
one
human
heart
some
idle
afternoon
the
ancient
sadness
contained
in
one
little
chord
on
the
piano
in
these
always
lunar
parodies
lohengrin
fils
de
parsifal
persée
et
andromède
each
a
kind
of
metaphysical
myth
he
realises
that
créature
va
hardiment
à
être
cérébrale
and
he
has
invented
these
fantastic
puppets
with
an
almost
japanese
art
of
spiritual
dislocation
they
are
in
part
a
way
of
taking
one
revenge
upon
science
by
an
ironical
borrowing
of
its
very
terms
which
dance
in
his
prose
and
verse
derisively
at
the
end
of
a
string
in
his
acceptance
of
the
fragility
of
things
as
actually
a
principle
of
art
laforgue
is
a
sort
of
transformed
watteau
showing
his
disdain
for
the
world
which
fascinates
him
in
quite
a
different
way
he
has
constructed
his
own
world
lunar
and
actual
speaking
slang
and
astronomy
with
a
constant
disengaging
of
the
visionary
aspect
under
which
frivolity
becomes
an
escape
from
the
arrogance
of
a
still
more
temporary
mode
of
being
the
world
as
it
appears
to
the
sober
majority
he
is
terribly
conscious
of
daily
life
can
not
omit
mentally
a
single
hour
of
the
day
and
his
flight
to
the
moon
is
in
sheer
desperation
he
sees
what
he
calls
in
every
gesture
but
he
can
not
see
it
without
these
gestures
and
he
sees
not
only
as
an
imposition
but
as
a
conquest
the
possibilities
for
art
which
come
from
the
sickly
modern
being
with
his
clothes
his
nerves
the
mere
fact
that
he
flowers
from
the
soil
of
his
epoch
it
is
an
art
of
the
nerves
this
art
of
laforgue
and
it
is
what
all
art
would
tend
towards
if
we
followed
our
nerves
on
all
their
journeys
there
is
in
it
all
the
restlessness
of
modern
life
the
haste
to
escape
from
whatever
weighs
too
heavily
on
the
liberty
of
the
moment
that
capricious
liberty
which
demands
only
room
enough
to
hurry
itself
weary
it
is
distressingly
conscious
of
the
unhappiness
of
mortality
but
it
plays
somewhat
uneasily
at
a
disdainful
indifference
and
it
is
out
of
these
elements
of
caprice
fear
contempt
linked
together
by
an
embracing
laughter
that
it
makes
its
existence
a
pas
de
type

y

laforgue
replies
to
those
who
come
to
him
with
classical
ideals
idéal

bien
vite
magnifiquement
submergé
in
life
itself
which
should
form
its
own
art
an
art
deliberately
ephemeral
with
the
attaching
pathos
of
passing
things
there
is
a
great
pity
at
the
root
of
this
art
of
laforgue
which
extends
with
the
artistic
sympathy
through
mere
clearness
of
vision
across
the
world
his
laughter
which
maeterlinck
has
defined
so
admirably
as
the
laughter
of
the
soul
is
the
laughter
of
pierrot
more
than
half
a
sob
and
shaken
out
of
him
with
a
deplorable
gesture
of
the
thin
arms
thrown
wide
he
is
a
metaphysical
pierrot

and
it
is
of
abstract
notions
the
whole
science
of
the
unconscious
that
he
makes
his
patter
as
it
is
part
of
his
manner
not
to
distinguish
between
irony
and
pity
or
even
belief
we
need
not
attempt
to
do
so
heine
should
teach
us
to
understand
at
least
so
much
of
a
poet
who
could
not
otherwise
resemble
him
less
in
laforgue
sentiment
is
squeezed
out
of
the
world
before
one
begins
to
play
at
ball
with
it
and
so
of
the
two
he
is
the
more
hopeless
he
has
invented
a
new
manner
of
being
rené
or
werther
an
inflexible
politeness
towards
man
woman
and
destiny
he
composes
hat
in
hand
and
smiles
with
an
exasperating
tolerance
before
all
the
transformations
of
the
eternal
feminine
he
is
very
conscious
of
death
but
his
of
death
is
above
all
things
gentlemanly
he
will
not
permit
himself
at
any
moment
the
luxury
of
dropping
the
mask
not
at
any
moment
read
this
complainte

the

of
its

an

yet
one

reads

attentively
enough
how
much
suffering
and
despair
and
resignation
to
what
is
after
all
the
inevitable
are
hidden
away
under
this
disguise
and
also
why
this
disguise
is
possible
laforgue
died
at
he
had
been
a
dying
man
all
his
life
and
his
work
has
the
fatal
evasiveness
of
those
who
shrink
from
remembering
the
one
thing
which
they
are
unable
to
forget
coming
as
he
does
after
rimbaud
turning
the
divination
of
the
other
into
theories
into
achieved
results
he
is
the
eternally
grown
up
mature
to
the
point
of
as
the
other
is
the
eternal
he
thinks
intensely
about
life
seeing
what
is
automatic
pathetically
ludicrous
in
it
almost
as
one
might
who
has
no
part
in
the
comedy
he
has
the
double
advantage
for
his
art
of
being
condemned
to
death
and
of
being
in
the
admirable
phrase
of
villiers
one
of
those
who
come
into
the
world
with
a
ray
of
moonlight
in
their
brains
maeterlinck
as
a
mystic
the
secret
of
things
which
is
just
beyond
the
most
subtle
words
the
secret
of
the
expressive
silences
has
always
been
clearer
to
maeterlinck
than
to
most
people
and
in
his
plays
he
has
elaborated
an
art
of
sensitive
taciturn
and
at
the
same
time
highly
ornamental
simplicity
which
has
come
nearer
than
any
other
art
to
being
the
voice
of
silence
to
maeterlinck
the
theatre
has
been
for
the
most
part
no
more
than
one
of
the
disguises
by
which
he
can
express
himself
and
with
his
book
of
meditations
on
the
inner
life
trésor
des
humbles
he
may
seem
to
have
dropped
his
disguise
all
art
hates
the
vague
not
the
mysterious
but
the
vague
two
opposites
very
commonly
confused
as
the
secret
with
the
obscure
the
infinite
with
the
indefinite
and
the
artist
who
is
also
a
mystic
hates
the
vague
with
a
more
profound
hatred
than
any
other
artist
thus
maeterlinck
endeavouring
to
clothe
mystical
conceptions
in
concrete
form
has
invented
a
drama
so
precise
so
curt
so
arbitrary
in
its
limits
that
it
can
safely
be
confided
to
the
masks
and
feigned
voices
of
marionettes
his
theatre
of
artificial
beings
who
are
at
once
more
ghostly
and
more
mechanical
than
the
living
actors
whom
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
so
curious
a
parody
of
life
moving
with
a
certain
freedom
of
action
across
the
stage
may
be
taken
as
itself
a
symbol
of
the
aspect
under
which
what
we
fantastically
term
real
life
presents
itself
to
the
mystic
are
we
not
all
puppets
in
a
theatre
of
marionettes
in
which
the
parts
we
play
the
dresses
we
wear
the
very
emotion
whose
dominance
gives
its
express
form
to
our
faces
have
all
been
chosen
for
us
in
which
i
it
may
be
with
curled
hair
and
a
spanish
cloak
play
the
romantic
lover
sorely
against
my
will
while
you
a
fair
penitent
for
no
repented
sin
pass
quietly
under
a
habit
and
as
our
parts
have
been
chosen
for
us
cur
motions
controlled
from
behind
the
curtain
so
the
words
we
seem
to
speak
are
but
spoken
through
us
and
we
do
but
utter
fragments
of
some
elaborate
invention
planned
for
larger
ends
than
our
personal
display
or
convenience
but
to
which
all
the
same
we
are
in
a
humble
degree
necessary
this
symbolical
theatre
its
very
existence
being
a
symbol
has
perplexed
many
minds
to
some
of
whom
it
has
seemed
puerile
a
mystification
of
small
words
and
repetitions
a
thing
of
attitudes
and
omissions
while
others
yet
more
unwisely
have
compared
it
with
the
violent
rhetorical
most
human
drama
of
the
elizabethans
with
shakespeare
himself
to
whom
all
the
world
was
a
stage
and
the
stage
all
this
world
certainly
a
sentence
already
famous
of
the
des
humbles
will
tell
you
what
it
signifies
to
maeterlinck
himself
i
have
come
to
believe
he
writes
in
tragique
quotidien
that
an
old
man
seated
in
his
armchair
waiting
quietly
under
the
lamplight
listening
without
knowing
it
to
all
the
eternal
laws
which
reign
about
his
house
interpreting
without
understanding
it
all
that
there
is
in
the
silence
of
doors
and
windows
and
in
the
little
voice
of
light
enduring
the
presence
of
his
soul
and
of
his
destiny
bowing
his
head
a
little
without
suspecting
that
all
the
powers
of
the
earth
intervene
and
stand
on
guard
in
the
room
like
attentive
servants
not
knowing
that
the
sun
itself
suspends
above
the
abyss
the
little
table
on
which
he
rests
his
elbow
and
that
there
is
not
a
star
in
the
sky
nor
a
force
in
the
soul
which
is
indifferent
to
the
motion
of
a
falling
eyelid
or
a
rising
thought
i
have
come
to
believe
that
this
motionless
old
man
lived
really
a
more
profound
human
and
universal
life
than
the
lover
who
strangles
his
mistress
the
captain
who
gains
a
victory
or
the
husband
who
his
honour
that
it
seems
to
me
says
all
there
is
to
be
said
of
the
intention
of
this
drama
which
maeterlinck
has
evoked
and
of
its
style
this
other
sentence
which
i
take
from
the
same
essay
it
is
only
the
words
that
at
first
sight
seem
useless
which
really
count
in
a
work
this
drama
then
is
a
drama
founded
on
philosophical
ideas
apprehended
emotionally
on
the
sense
of
the
mystery
of
the
universe
of
the
weakness
of
humanity
that
sense
which
pascal
expressed
when
he
said
qui
le
plus
est
de
voir
que
tout
le
monde
pas
étonné
de
sa
faiblesse
with
an
acute
feeling
of
the
pathetic
ignorance
in
which
the
souls
nearest
to
one
another
look
out
upon
their
neighbours
it
is
a
drama
in
which
the
interest
is
concentrated
on
vague
people
who
are
little
parts
of
the
universal
consciousness
their
strange
names
being
but
the
pseudonyms
of
obscure
passions
intimate
emotions
they
have
the
fascination
which
we
find
in
the
eyes
of
certain
pictures
so
much
more
real
and
disquieting
so
much
more
permanent
with
us
than
living
people
and
they
have
the
touching
simplicity
of
children
they
are
always
children
in
their
ignorance
of
themselves
of
one
another
and
of
fate
and
because
they
are
so
disembodied
of
the
more
trivial
accidents
of
life
they
give
themselves
without
limitation
to
whatever
passionate
instinct
possesses
them
i
do
not
know
a
more
passionate
than
that
scene
in
the
wood
beside
the
fountain
where
pelléas
and
mélisande
confess
the
strange
burden
which
has
come
upon
them
when
the
soul
gives
itself
absolutely
to
love
all
the
barriers
of
the
world
are
burnt
away
and
all
its
wisdom
and
subtlety
are
as
incense
poured
on
a
flame
morality
too
is
burnt
away
no
longer
exists
any
more
than
it
does
for
children
or
for
god
maeterlinck
has
realised
better
than
any
one
else
the
significance
in
life
and
art
of
mystery
he
has
realised
how
unsearchable
is
the
darkness
out
of
which
we
have
but
just
stepped
and
the
darkness
into
which
we
are
about
to
pass
and
he
has
realised
how
the
thought
and
sense
of
that
twofold
darkness
invade
the
little
space
of
light
in
which
for
a
moment
we
move
the
depth
to
which
they
shadow
our
steps
even
in
that
moment
partial
escape
but
in
some
of
his
plays
he
would
seem
to
have
apprehended
this
mystery
as
a
thing
merely
or
mainly
terrifying
the
actual
physical
darkness
blind
men
the
actual
physical
approach
of
death
as
the
intruder
he
has
shown
us
people
huddled
at
a
window
out
of
which
they
are
almost
afraid
to
look
or
beating
at
a
door
the
opening
of
which
they
dread
fear
shivers
through
these
plays
creeping
across
our
nerves
like
a
damp
mist
coiling
up
out
of
a
valley
and
there
is
beauty
certainly
in
this
vague
spiritual
fear
but
a
less
obvious
kind
of
beauty
than
that
which
gives
its
profound
pathos
to
et
sélysette
the
one
play
written
since
the
writing
of
the
essays
here
is
mystery
which
is
also
pure
beauty
in
these
delicate
approaches
of
intellectual
pathos
in
which
suffering
and
death
and
error
become
transformed
into
something
almost
happy
so
full
is
it
of
strange
light
and
the
aim
of
maeterlinck
in
his
plays
is
not
only
to
render
the
soul
and
the
soul
atmosphere
but
to
reveal
this
strangeness
pity
and
beauty
through
beautiful
pictures
no
dramatist
has
ever
been
so
careful
that
his
scenes
should
be
in
themselves
beautiful
or
has
made
the
actual
space
of
forest
tower
or
seashore
so
emotionally
significant
he
has
realised
after
wagner
that
the
art
of
the
stage
is
the
art
of
pictorial
beauty
of
the
correspondence
in
rhythm
between
the
speakers
their
words
and
their
surroundings
he
has
seen
how
in
this
way
and
in
this
way
alone
the
emotion
which
it
is
but
a
part
of
the
poetic
drama
to
express
can
be
at
once
intensified
and
purified
it
is
only
after
hinting
at
many
of
the
things
which
he
had
to
say
in
these
plays
which
have
after
all
been
a
kind
of
subterfuge
that
maeterlinck
has
cared
or
been
able
to
speak
with
the
direct
utterance
of
the
essays
and
what
may
seem
curious
is
that
this
prose
of
the
essays
which
is
the
prose
of
a
doctrine
is
incomparably
more
beautiful
than
the
prose
of
the
plays
which
was
the
prose
of
an
art
holding
on
this
point
a
different
opinion
from
one
who
was
in
many
senses
his
master
villiers
de
he
did
not
admit
that
beauty
of
words
or
even
any
expressed
beauty
of
thoughts
had
its
place
in
spoken
dialogue
even
though
it
was
not
two
living
actors
speaking
to
one
another
on
the
stage
but
a
soul
speaking
to
a
soul
and
imagined
speaking
through
the
mouths
of
marionettes
but
that
beauty
of
phrase
which
makes
the
profound
and
sometimes
obscure
pages
of
shine
as
with
the
crossing
fire
of
jewels
rejoices
us
though
with
a
softer
a
more
equable
radiance
in
the
pages
of
these
essays
in
which
every
sentence
has
the
beauty
of
an
intellectual
emotion
preserved
at
the
same
height
of
tranquil
ecstasy
from
first
page
to
last
there
is
a
sort
of
religious
calm
in
these
deliberate
sentences
into
which
the
writer
has
known
how
to
introduce
that
divine
monotony
which
is
one
of
the
accomplishments
of
great
style
never
has
simplicity
been
more
ornate
or
a
fine
beauty
more
visible
through
its
but
after
all
the
claim
upon
us
of
this
book
is
not
the
claim
of
a
work
of
art
but
of
a
doctrine
and
more
than
that
of
a
system
belonging
as
he
does
to
the
eternal
hierarchy
the
unbroken
succession
of
the
mystics
maeterlinck
has
apprehended
what
is
essential
in
the
mystical
doctrine
with
a
more
profound
comprehension
and
thus
more
systematically
than
any
mystic
of
recent
times
he
has
many
points
of
resemblance
with
emerson
on
whom
he
has
written
an
essay
which
is
properly
an
exposition
of
his
own
personal
ideas
but
emerson
who
proclaimed
the
supreme
guidance
of
the
inner
light
the
supreme
necessity
of
trusting
instinct
of
honouring
emotion
did
but
proclaim
all
this
not
without
a
certain
vagueness
maeterlinck
has
systematised
it
a
more
profound
mystic
than
emerson
he
has
greater
command
of
that
which
comes
to
him
unawares
is
less
at
the
mercy
of
visiting
angels
also
it
may
be
said
that
he
surrenders
himself
to
them
more
absolutely
with
less
reserve
and
discretion
and
as
he
has
infinite
leisure
his
contemplation
being
subject
to
no
limits
of
time
he
is
ready
to
follow
them
on
unknown
rounds
to
any
distance
in
any
direction
ready
also
to
rest
in
any
wayside
inn
without
fearing
that
he
will
have
lost
the
road
on
the
morrow
this
old
gospel
of
which
maeterlinck
is
the
new
voice
has
been
quietly
waiting
until
certain
bankruptcies
the
bankruptcy
of
science
of
the
positive
philosophies
should
allow
it
full
credit
considering
the
length
even
of
time
it
has
not
had
an
unreasonable
space
of
waiting
and
remember
that
it
takes
time
but
little
into
account
we
have
seen
many
little
gospels
demanding
of
every
emotion
of
every
instinct
its
certificate
at
the
hand
of
some
respectable
authority
without
confidence
in
themselves
or
in
things
and
led
by
science
which
is
as
if
one
were
led
by
one
they
demand
a
reasonable
explanation
of
every
mystery
not
finding
that
explanation
they
reject
the
mystery
which
is
as
if
the
fly
on
the
wheel
rejected
the
wheel
because
it
was
hidden
from
his
eyes
by
the
dust
of
its
own
raising
the
mystic
is
at
once
the
proudest
and
the
humblest
of
men
he
is
as
a
child
who
resigns
himself
to
the
guidance
of
an
unseen
hand
the
hand
of
one
walking
by
his
side
he
resigns
himself
with
the
humility
and
he
has
the
pride
of
the
humble
a
pride
manifesting
itself
in
the
calm
rejection
of
every
accepted
map
of
the
roads
of
every
offer
of
assistance
of
every
painted
signpost
pointing
out
the
smoothest
ways
on
which
to
travel
he
demands
no
authority
for
the
unseen
hand
whose
fingers
he
feels
upon
his
wrist
he
conceives
of
life
not
indeed
so
much
as
a
road
on
which
one
walks
very
much
at
one
own
discretion
but
as
a
blown
and
wandering
ship
surrounded
by
a
sea
from
which
there
is
no
glimpse
of
land
and
he
conceives
that
to
the
currents
of
that
sea
he
may
safely
trust
himself
let
his
hand
indeed
be
on
the
rudder
there
will
be
no
miracle
worked
for
him
it
is
enough
miracle
that
the
sea
should
be
there
and
the
ship
and
he
himself
he
will
never
know
why
his
hand
should
turn
the
rudder
this
way
rather
than
that
jacob
boehme
has
said
very
subtly
that
man
does
not
perceive
the
truth
but
god
perceives
the
truth
in
man
that
is
that
whatever
we
perceive
or
do
is
not
perceived
or
done
consciously
by
us
but
unconsciously
through
us
our
business
then
is
to
tend
that
inner
light
by
which
most
mystics
have
symbolised
that
which
at
once
guides
us
in
time
and
attaches
us
to
eternity
this
inner
light
is
no
miraculous
descent
of
the
holy
spirit
but
the
perfectly
natural
though
it
may
finally
be
overcoming
ascent
of
the
spirit
within
us
the
spirit
in
all
men
being
but
a
ray
of
the
universal
fight
it
can
by
careful
tending
by
the
removal
of
all
obstruction
the
cleansing
of
the
vessel
the
trimming
of
the
wick
as
it
were
be
increased
made
to
burn
with
a
steadier
a
brighter
flame
in
the
last
rapture
it
may
become
dazzling
may
blind
the
watcher
with
excess
of
light
shutting
him
in
within
the
circle
of
transfiguration
whose
extreme
radiance
will
leave
all
the
rest
of
the
world
henceforth
one
darkness
all
mystics
being
concerned
with
what
is
divine
in
life
with
the
laws
which
apply
equally
to
time
and
eternity
it
may
happen
to
one
to
concern
himself
chiefly
with
time
seen
under
the
aspect
of
eternity
to
another
to
concern
himself
rather
with
eternity
seen
under
the
aspect
of
time
thus
many
mystics
have
occupied
themselves
very
profitably
with
showing
how
natural
how
explicable
on
their
own
terms
are
the
mysteries
of
life
the
whole
aim
of
maeterlinck
is
to
show
how
mysterious
all
life
is
what
an
astonishing
thing
it
is
merely
to
live
what
he
had
pointed
out
to
us
with
certain
solemn
gestures
in
his
plays
he
sets
himself
now
to
affirm
slowly
fully
with
that
confidence
in
mystery
of
which
he
speaks
because
there
is
not
an
hour
without
its
familiar
miracles
and
its
ineffable
suggestions
he
sets
himself
to
show
us
these
miracles
and
these
meanings
where
others
have
not
always
sought
or
found
them
in
women
in
children
in
the
theatre
he
seems
to
touch
at
one
moment
or
another
whether
he
is
discussing
beauté
or
tragique
quotidien
on
all
of
these
hours
and
there
is
no
hour
so
dark
that
his
touch
does
not
illuminate
it
and
it
is
characteristic
of
him
of
his
confidence
in
mystery
that
he
speaks
always
without
raising
his
voice
without
surprise
or
triumph
or
the
air
of
having
said
anything
more
than
the
simplest
observation
he
speaks
not
as
if
he
knew
more
than
others
or
had
sought
out
more
elaborate
secrets
but
as
if
he
had
listened
more
attentively
loving
most
those
writers
whose
works
are
nearest
to
silence
he
begins
his
book
significantly
with
an
essay
on
silence
an
essay
which
like
all
these
essays
has
the
reserve
the
expressive
reticence
of
those
active
silences
of
which
he
succeeds
in
revealing
a
few
of
the
secrets
souls
he
tells
us
are
weighed
in
silence
as
gold
and
silver
are
weighed
in
pure
water
and
the
words
which
we
pronounce
have
no
meaning
except
through
the
silence
in
which
they
are
bathed
we
seek
to
know
that
we
may
learn
not
to
know
knowledge
that
which
can
be
known
by
the
pure
reason
metaphysics
indispensable
on
this
side
of
the
frontiers
being
after
all
precisely
what
is
least
essential
to
us
since
least
essentially
ourselves
we
possess
a
self
more
profound
and
more
boundless
than
the
self
of
the
passions
or
of
pure
reason
there
comes
a
moment
when
the
phenomena
of
our
customary
consciousness
what
we
may
call
the
consciousness
of
the
passions
or
of
our
normal
relationships
no
longer
mean
anything
to
us
no
longer
touch
our
real
life
i
admit
that
this
consciousness
is
often
interesting
in
its
way
and
that
it
is
often
necessary
to
know
it
thoroughly
but
it
is
a
surface
plant
and
its
roots
fear
the
great
central
fire
of
our
being
i
may
commit
a
crime
without
the
least
breath
stirring
the
tiniest
flame
of
this
fire
and
on
the
other
hand
the
crossing
of
a
single
glance
a
thought
which
never
comes
into
being
a
minute
which
passes
without
the
utterance
of
a
word
may
rouse
it
into
terrible
agitations
in
the
depths
of
its
retreat
and
cause
it
to
overflow
upon
my
life
our
soul
does
not
judge
as
we
judge
it
is
a
capricious
and
hidden
thing
it
can
be
reached
by
a
breath
and
unconscious
of
a
tempest
let
us
find
out
what
reaches
it
everything
is
there
for
it
is
there
that
we
ourselves
are
and
it
is
towards
this
point
that
all
the
words
of
this
book
tend
maeterlinck
unlike
most
men
what
is
man
but
a
god
who
is
afraid
is
not
miserly
of
immortal
things
he
utters
the
most
divine
secrets
without
fear
betraying
certain
of
the
soul
in
those
most
nearly
inaccessible
retreats
which
lie
nearest
to
us
all
that
he
says
we
know
already
we
may
deny
it
but
we
know
it
it
is
what
we
are
not
often
at
leisure
enough
with
ourselves
sincere
enough
with
ourselves
to
realise
what
we
often
dare
not
realise
but
when
he
says
it
we
know
that
it
is
true
and
our
knowledge
of
it
is
his
warrant
for
saying
it
he
is
what
he
is
precisely
because
he
tells
us
nothing
which
we
do
not
already
know
or
it
may
be
what
we
have
known
and
forgotten
the
mystic
let
it
be
remembered
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
moralist
he
speaks
only
to
those
who
are
already
prepared
to
listen
to
him
and
he
is
indifferent
to
the
practical
effect
which
these
or
others
may
draw
from
his
words
a
young
and
profound
mystic
of
our
day
has
figured
the
influence
of
wise
words
upon
the
foolish
and
headstrong
as
torches
thrown
into
a
burning
city
the
mystic
knows
well
that
it
is
not
always
the
soul
of
the
drunkard
or
the
blasphemer
which
is
farthest
from
the
eternal
beauty
he
is
concerned
only
with
that
soul
of
the
soul
that
life
of
life
with
which
the
day
doings
have
so
little
to
do
itself
a
mystery
and
at
home
only
among
those
supreme
mysteries
which
surround
it
like
an
atmosphere
it
is
not
always
that
he
cares
that
his
message
or
his
vision
may
be
as
clear
to
others
as
it
is
to
himself
but
because
he
is
an
artist
and
not
only
a
philosopher
maeterlinck
has
taken
especial
pains
that
not
a
word
of
his
may
go
astray
and
there
is
not
a
word
of
this
book
which
needs
to
be
read
twice
in
order
that
it
may
be
understood
by
the
least
trained
of
attentive
readers
it
is
indeed
as
he
calls
it
the
treasure
of
the
lowly
conclusion
our
only
chance
in
this
world
of
a
complete
happiness
lies
in
the
measure
of
our
success
in
shutting
the
eyes
of
the
mind
and
deadening
its
sense
of
hearing
and
dulling
the
keenness
of
its
apprehension
of
the
unknown
knowing
so
much
less
than
nothing
for
we
are
entrapped
in
smiling
and
appearances
our
life
may
seem
to
be
but
a
little
space
of
leisure
in
which
it
will
be
the
necessary
business
of
each
of
us
to
speculate
on
what
is
so
rapidly
becoming
the
past
and
so
rapidly
becoming
the
future
that
scarcely
existing
present
which
is
after
all
our
only
possession
yet
as
the
present
passes
from
us
hardly
to
be
enjoyed
except
as
memory
or
as
hope
and
only
with
an
at
best
partial
recognition
of
the
uncertainty
or
inutility
of
both
it
is
with
a
kind
of
terror
that
we
wake
up
every
now
and
then
to
the
whole
knowledge
of
our
ignorance
and
to
some
perception
of
where
it
is
leading
us
to
live
through
a
single
day
with
that
overpowering
consciousness
of
our
real
position
which
in
the
moments
in
which
alone
it
mercifully
comes
is
like
blinding
light
or
the
thrust
of
a
flaming
sword
would
drive
any
man
out
of
his
senses
it
is
our
hesitations
the
excuses
of
our
hearts
the
compromises
of
our
intelligence
which
save
us
we
can
forget
so
much
we
can
bear
suspense
with
so
fortunate
an
evasion
of
its
real
issues
we
are
so
admirably
finite
and
so
there
is
a
great
silent
conspiracy
between
us
to
forget
death
all
our
lives
are
spent
in
busily
forgetting
death
that
is
why
we
are
active
about
so
many
things
which
we
know
to
be
unimportant
why
we
are
so
afraid
of
solitude
and
so
thankful
for
the
company
of
our
allowing
ourselves
for
the
most
part
to
be
but
vaguely
conscious
of
that
great
suspense
in
which
we
live
we
find
our
escape
from
its
sterile
annihilating
reality
in
many
dreams
in
religion
passion
art
each
a
forgetfulness
each
a
symbol
of
creation
religion
being
the
creation
of
a
new
heaven
passion
the
creation
of
a
new
earth
and
art
in
its
mingling
of
heaven
and
earth
the
creation
of
heaven
out
of
earth
each
is
a
kind
of
sublime
selfishness
the
saint
the
lover
and
the
artist
having
each
an
incommunicable
ecstasy
which
he
esteems
as
his
ultimate
attainment
however
in
his
lower
moments
he
may
serve
god
in
action
or
do
the
will
of
his
mistress
or
minister
to
men
by
showing
them
a
little
beauty
but
it
is
before
all
things
an
escape
and
the
prophets
who
have
redeemed
the
world
and
the
artists
who
have
made
the
world
beautiful
and
the
lovers
who
have
quickened
the
pulses
of
the
world
have
really
whether
they
knew
it
or
not
been
fleeing
from
the
certainty
of
one
thought
that
we
have
all
of
us
only
our
one
day
and
from
the
dread
of
that
other
thought
that
the
day
however
used
must
after
all
be
wasted
the
fear
of
death
is
not
cowardice
it
is
rather
an
intellectual
dissatisfaction
with
an
enigma
which
has
been
presented
to
us
and
which
can
be
solved
only
when
its
solution
is
of
no
further
use
all
we
have
to
ask
of
death
is
the
meaning
of
life
and
we
are
waiting
all
through
life
to
ask
that
question
that
life
should
be
happy
or
unhappy
as
those
words
are
used
means
so
very
little
and
the
heightening
or
lessening
of
the
general
felicity
of
the
world
means
so
little
to
any
individual
there
is
something
almost
vulgar
in
happiness
which
does
not
become
joy
and
joy
is
an
ecstasy
which
can
rarely
be
maintained
in
the
soul
for
more
than
the
moment
during
which
we
recognize
that
it
is
not
sorrow
only
very
young
people
want
to
be
happy
what
we
all
want
is
to
be
quite
sure
that
there
is
something
which
makes
it
worth
while
to
go
on
living
in
what
seems
to
us
our
best
way
at
our
finest
intensity
something
beyond
the
mere
fact
that
we
are
satisfying
a
sort
of
inner
logic
which
may
be
quite
faulty
and
that
we
get
our
best
makeshift
for
happiness
on
that
so
hazardous
assumption
well
the
doctrine
of
mysticism
with
which
all
this
symbolical
literature
has
so
much
to
do
of
which
it
is
all
so
much
the
expression
presents
us
not
with
a
guide
for
conduct
not
with
a
plan
for
our
happiness
not
with
an
explanation
of
any
mystery
but
with
a
theory
of
life
which
makes
us
familiar
with
mystery
and
which
seems
to
harmonise
those
instincts
which
make
for
religion
passion
and
art
freeing
us
at
once
of
a
great
bondage
the
final
uncertainty
remains
but
we
seem
to
knock
less
helplessly
at
closed
doors
coming
so
much
closer
to
the
once
terrifying
eternity
of
things
about
us
as
we
come
to
look
upon
these
things
as
shadows
through
which
we
have
our
shadowy
passage
for
in
the
particular
acts
of
human
life
plotinus
tells
us
it
is
not
the
interior
soul
and
the
true
man
but
the
exterior
shadow
of
the
man
alone
which
laments
and
weeps
performing
his
part
on
the
earth
as
in
a
more
ample
and
extended
scene
in
which
many
shadows
of
souls
and
phantom
scenes
appear
and
as
we
realise
the
identity
of
a
poem
a
prayer
or
a
kiss
in
that
spiritual
universe
which
we
are
weaving
for
ourselves
each
out
of
a
thread
of
the
great
fabric
as
we
realise
the
infinite
insignificance
of
action
its
immense
distance
from
the
current
of
life
as
we
realise
the
delight
of
feeling
ourselves
carried
onward
by
forces
which
it
is
our
wisdom
to
obey
it
is
at
least
with
a
certain
relief
that
we
turn
to
an
ancient
doctrine
so
much
the
more
likely
to
be
true
because
it
has
so
much
the
air
of
a
dream
on
this
theory
alone
does
all
life
become
worth
living
all
art
worth
making
all
worship
worth
offering
and
because
it
might
slay
as
well
as
save
because
the
freedom
of
its
sweet
captivity
might
so
easily
become
deadly
to
the
fool
because
that
is
the
hardest
path
to
walk
in
where
you
are
told
only
walk
well
it
is
perhaps
the
only
counsel
of
perfection
which
can
ever
really
mean
much
to
the
artist
bibliography
and
notes
the
essays
contained
in
this
book
are
not
intended
to
give
information
they
are
concerned
with
ideas
rather
than
with
facts
each
is
a
study
of
a
problem
only
in
part
a
literary
one
in
which
i
have
endeavoured
to
consider
writers
as
personalities
under
the
action
of
spiritual
forces
or
as
themselves
so
many
forces
but
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
readers
have
a
right
to
demand
information
in
regard
to
writers
who
are
so
often
likely
to
be
unfamiliar
to
them
i
have
therefore
given
a
bibliography
of
the
works
of
each
writer
with
whom
i
have
dealt
and
i
have
added
a
number
of
notes
giving
various
particulars
which
i
think
are
likely
to
be
useful
in
fixing
more
definitely
the
personal
characteristics
of
these
writers

portraits
drawn
on

by
rothenstein
and
published
in
are
but
the
latest
if
also
among
the
best
of
a
long
series
of
which
rothenstein
himself
has
done
two
or
three
others
one
of
which
was
reproduced
in
the
mall
in
when
verlaine
was
in
london
cazals
a
young
artist
who
was
one
of
verlaine
most
intimate
friends
has
done
i
should
not
like
to
say
how
many
portraits
some
of
which
he
has
gathered
together
in
a
little
book

portraits
there
are
portraits
in
nine
of
verlaine
own
books
several
of
them
by
cazals
roughly
jotted

notes
of
moments
one
by
anquetin
a
strong
piece

in

is

a

of

many
more
and
there
are
yet
others
in
the
extremely
objectionable
book
of
charles
donos
intime
the
contains
a
many
other
portraits
have
appeared
in
french
and
english
and
german
and
italian
magazines
and
there
is
yet
another
portrait
in
the
admirable
little
book
of
charles
morice
verlaine
which
contains
by
far
the
best
study
that
has
ever
been
made
of
verlaine
as
a
poet
i
believe
george
moore
article
a
great
poet
reprinted
in
and
opinions
was
the
first
that
was
written
on
verlaine
in
england
my
own
article
in
the
in
was
i
believe
the
first
detailed
study
of
the
whole
of
his
work
up
to
that
date
at
last
in
the
de
paul
verlaine
of
edmund
lepelletier
there
has
come
the
authentic
record
an
honest
and
instructed
life
of
verlaine
has
long
been
wanted
if
only
as
an
antidote
to
the
defamatory
production
called
intime
made
up
out
of
materials
collected
by
the
publisher
léon
vanier
in
his
own
defense
in
order
that
a
hard
taskmaster
might
be
presented
to
the
world
in
the
colours
of
a
benefactor
a
legend
which
may
well
have
seemed
plausible
to
those
who
knew
verlaine
only
at
the
end
of
his
life
has
obtained
currency
and
a
comparison
of
verlaine
with
villon
not
only
as
a
poet
which
is
to
his
honour
but
also
as
a
man
has
been
made
and
believed
lepelletier
book
is
an
exact
chronicle
of
a
friendship
which
lasted
without
a
break
for
years
that
is
from
the
time
when
verlaine
was
sixteen
to
the
time
of
his
death
and
a
more
sane
loyal
and
impartial
chronicle
of
any
man
life
we
have
never
read
it
is
written
with
full
knowledge
of
every
part
of
the
career
which
it
traces
and
it
is
written
by
a
man
who
puts
down
whatever
he
knows
exactly
as
he
believes
it
to
have
been
his
conclusion
is
that
on
peut
fouiller
sa
vie
au
microscope
on
y
reconnaîtra
des
fautes
des
folies
des
faiblesses
bien
des
souffrances
aussi
avec
de
la
fatalité
au
fond
pas
de
honte
véritable
pas
une
vile
et
indigne
action
les
vrais
amis
du
poète
peuvent
donc
revendiquer
pour
lui
homme
sans
doute
très
vulgaire
mais
qui
aux
yeux
de
certains
a
encore
du
prix
in
verlaine
dedicated
mémoires
to
lepelletier
affirming
the
resolve
on
his
part
to
garder
intacte
la
vielle
amitié
si
forte
et
si
belle
the
compact
has
been
kept
nobly
by
the
survivor
it
may
indeed
be
questioned
whether
lepelletier
does
not
insist
a
little
too
much
on
the
bourgeois
element
which
he
finds
in
verlaine
when
a
man
has
suffered
under
unjust
accusations
it
is
natural
for
his
friends
to
defend
him
under
whatever
aspect
seems
to
them
most
generally
convincing
so
it
is
interesting
to
know
that
for
seven
years
verlaine
was
in
a
municipal
office
the
bureau
des
budgets
et
comptes
and
that
later
in
he
made
an
application
which
was
refused
for
leave
to
return
to
his
former
post
lepelletier
reproaches
the
authorities
for
an
action
which
he
takes
to
have
precipitated
verlaine
into
the
final
misery
of
his
vagabondage
he
would
have
lived
quietly
he
says
and
written
in
security
both
assumptions
may
be
doubted
what
was
bourgeois
and
contented
with
quiet
was
a
small
part
of
the
nature
of
one
who
was
too
strong
as
well
as
too
weak
to
remain
within
limits
the
terrible
force
of
verlaine
weakness
would
always
in
the
process
of
making
him
a
poet
have
carried
him
far
from
that
tranquilité
sinécure
bureaucratique
which
lepelletier
strangely
regrets
for
him
it
is
hardly
permitted
in
looking
back
over
a
disastrous
life
which
has
expressed
itself
in
notable
poetry
to
regret
that
the
end
should
have
been
attained
by
no
matter
what
means
on
moral
questions
lepelletier
speaks
with
the
authority
of
an
intimate
friendship
and
from
a
point
of
view
which
seems
wholly
without
prejudice
he
defends
verlaine
with
evident
conviction
against
the
most
serious
charges
brought
against
him
and
he
shows
at
least
on
documentary
evidence
that
nothing
of
the
darker
part
of
his
legend
was
ever
proved
against
him
in
any
of
his
arrests
and
imprisonments
drink
and
mad
rages
let
loose
by
drink
account
ignobly
enough
for
all
of
them
in
the
famous
quarrel
with
rimbaud
which
brought
him
into
prison
for
eighteen
months
the
accusation
reads
pour
avoir
à
bruxelles
le
juillet
volontairement
portés
des
coups
et
fait
des
blessures
ayant
entraîné
une
incapacité
de
travail
personnel
à
arthur
rimbaud
the
whole
account
of
this
episode
is
given
by
lepelletier
in
great
detail
and
from
this
we
learn
that
it
was
by
the
merest
change
of
mind
on
the
part
of
rimbaud
or
by
sudden
treachery
that
the
matter
came
into
the
courts
at
all
lepelletier
supplies
an
unfavourable
account
of
rimbaud
whom
he
looks
upon
as
the
evil
counsellor
of
verlaine
probably
with
justice
there
is
little
doubt
that
rimbaud
apart
from
his
genuine
touch
of
precocious
power
which
had
its
influence
on
the
genius
of
verlaine
was
a
mauvais
sujet
of
a
selfish
and
mischievous
kind
he
was
destructive
and
pitiless
and
having
done
his
worst
he
went
off
carelessly
into
africa
it
will
surprise
some
readers
to
learn
that
verlaine
took
his
degree
of
and
that
on
leaving
the
lycée
bonaparte
he
received
a
certificate
placing
him
au
nombre
des
sujets
distingués
que
compte
he
was
well
grounded
in
latin
and
fairly
well
in
english
and
at
several
intervals
in
his
life
attempted
to
master
spanish
with
the
vague
desire
of
translating
calderon
at
an
early
period
he
read
french
literature
classical
and
modern
with
avidity
translations
of
english
german
and
eastern
classics
books
of
criticism
and
philosophy

he
was
absorbed
in

he
read

and
aloysius

the
only
poem
that
remains
of
this
early
period
is
the
nocturne

of
the
saturniens
which
dates
from
about
his

year

pointed
out

here
the
evident
point
de

pour
aller
au

the
chapter
in
which
lepelletier
tells
the
story
of
the
origin
of
the
most
famous
literary
movement
since
that
of
the
parnasse
is
one
of
the
most
entertaining
in
the
book
and
gives
in
its
narrative
of
the
receptions
chez
nina
a
which
lepelletier
describes
as
the
ancestor
of
the
chat
noir
a
vivid
picture
of
the
days
when
villiers
de
and
françois
coppée
were
beginners
together
nina
de
villars
was
one
of
the
oddest
people
of
her
time
she
made
a
kind
of
private
bohemia
for
poets
musicians
all
kinds
of
artists
and
eccentric
people
herself
the
most
eccentric
of
them
all
it
was
at
her
house
that
the
members
of
the
parnasse
gathered
while
they
selected
as
their
more
formal
the
of
madame
ricard
it
is
not
generally
known
that
verlaine
was
the
third
volume
to
be
issued
by
the
house
of
lemerre
afterwards
to
become
a
famous
publisher
of
poets
and
it
was
in
this
volume
that
the
new
laws
of
the
parnasse
were
first
formulated
that
impassivity
that
marble
egoism
which
verlaine
was
so
soon
to
reject
for
a
more
living
impulse
but
which
neither
leconte
de
lisle
nor
héredia
was
ever
to
abandon
when
one
thinks
of
the
later
verlaine
it
is
curious
to
turn
to
that
first
formula
en
marvre
où
non
le
vénus
de
milo
verlaine
verse
suddenly
becomes
human
with
bonne
chanson
though
the
humanity
in
it
is
not
yet
salted
as
with
fire
it
is
the
record
of
the
event
which
as
lepelletier
says
dominated
his
whole
life
the
marriage
with
mathilde
maute
the
young
girl
with
whom
he
had
fallen
in
love
at
first
sight
and
whose
desertion
of
him
however
explicable
he
never
forgot
nor
forgave
nothing
could
be
more
just
or
delicate
than
lepelletier
treatment
of
the
whole
situation
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
is
right
in
saying
that
the
young
wife
eût
une
grande
responsabilité
dans
les
désordres
de
désorbitée
du
poète
verlaine
as
he
says
était
bon
aimant
et
comme
un
souffrant
fallait
le
traiter
vous
rien
compris
à
ma
simplicité
he
wrote
long
afterwards
addressing
the
woman
of
whom
lepelletier
says
il
toujours
il
with
his
marriage
verlaine
disasters
begin
rimbaud
enters
his
life
and
turns
the
current
of
it
the
vagabondage
begins
in
france
and
england
and
the
letters
written
from
london
are
among
the
most
vivid
documents
in
the
book
thumbnail
sketches
full
of
keen
observation
then
comes
his
imprisonment
and
conversion
to
catholicism
here
lepelletier
while
he
gives
us
an
infinity
of
details
which
he
alone
could
give
adopts
an
attitude
which
we
can
not
think
to
be
justified
and
which
as
a
matter
of
fact
verlaine
protested
against
during
his
lifetime
cette
conversion
profonde
et
véridique
he
asks
and
he
answers
je
ne
le
crois
pas
that
his
conversion
had
much
influence
on
verlaine
conduct
can
not
be
contended
but
conduct
and
belief
are
two
different
things
sincerity
of
the
moment
was
his
fundamental
characteristic
but
the
moments
made
and
remade
his
moods
in
their
passing
the
religion
of
is
not
the
less
genuine
because
that
grave
and
sacred
book
was
followed
by
the
revolt
of
verlaine
tried
to
explain
in
the
poems
themselves
in
prefaces
and
in
conversation
with
friends
how
natural
it
was
to
sin
and
to
repent
and
to
use
the
same
childlike
words
in
the
immediate
rendering
of
sin
and
of
repentance
this
which
made
any
regular
existence
an
impossibility
was
a
part
of
him
which
gave
a
quality
to
his
work
unlike
that
of
any
other
poet
of
our
time
at
the
end
of
his
life
hardly
anything
but
the
was
left
and
the
poems
became
mere
outcries
and
gestures
lepelletier
is
justly
indignant
at
the
action
of
vanier
in
publishing
after
deaths
the
collection
called
made
up
of
scraps
and
impromptus
which
the
poet
certainly
never
intended
to
publish
here
we
see
part
of
the
weakness
of
a
great
man
who
becomes
petty
when
he
puts
off
his
true
character
and
tries
to
be
angry
la
fureur
he
says
somewhere
and
there
is
no
essential
part
of
his
work
which
is
not
the
expression
of
some
form
of
love
grotesque
or
heroic
human
or
divine
of
all
this
later
more
and
more
miserable
part
of
the
life
of
verlaine
lepelletier
has
less
to
tell
us
it
has
been
sufficiently
commented
on
not
always
by
friendly
or
understanding
witnesses
what
we
get
in
this
book
for
the
first
time
is
a
view
of
the
life
as
a
whole
with
all
that
is
beautiful
tragic
and
desperate
in
it
it
is
not
an
apology
it
is
a
statement
it
not
only
does
honor
to
a
great
and
unhappy
man
of
genius
it

maeterlinck
has
had
the
good
or
bad
fortune
to
be
more
promptly
and
more
violently
praised
at
the
beginning
of
his
career
than
at
all
events
any
other
writer
of
whom
i
have
spoken
in
this
volume
his
fame
in
france
was
made
by
a
flaming
article
of
octave
mirbeau
in
the
of
august
mirbeau
greeted
him
as
the
belgian
shakepeare
and
expressed
his
opinion
of
princesse
by
saying
maeterlinck
has
given
us
the
greatest
work
of
genius
that
has
been
produced
in
our
time
and
the
most
extraordinary
and
the
most
naïve
too
comparable
dare
i
say
superior
in
beauty
to
what
is
most
beautiful
in
shakespeare
more
tragic
than
more
extraordinary
in
thought
than
william
archer
introduced
maeterlinck
to
england
in
an
article
called
a
pessimist
playwright
in
the
review
september
less
enthusiastic
than
mirbeau
he
defined
the
author
of
princesse
as
a
webster
who
had
read
alfred

a
freely
adapted
version
of
was
given
by
tree
at
the
haymarket
theatre
january
and
since
that
time
many
of
maeterlinck
plays
have
been
acted
without
cuts
or
with
but
few
cuts
at
various
london
theatres
several
of
his

i
have
spoken
in
this
volume
chiefly
of
maeterlinck
essays
and
but
little
of
his
plays
and
i
have
said
all
that
i
had
to
say
without
special
reference
to
the
second
volume
of
essays

trésor

that
book
is
a
message
a
doctrine
even
more
than
it
is
a
piece
of
literature
it
is
a
treatise
on
wisdom
and
happiness
on
the
search
for
happiness
because
it
is
wisdom
not
for
wisdom
because
it
is
happiness
it
is
a
book
of
patient
and
resigned
philosophy
a
very
flemish
philosophy
more
resigned
than
even
trésor

in
a
sense
it
seems
to
aim
less
high
an
ecstatic
mysticism
has
given
way
to
a
kind
of
prudence
is
this
coming
nearer
to
the
earth
really
an
intellectual
ascent
or
descent
at
least
it
is
a
divergence
and
it
probably
indicates
a
divergence
in
art
as
well
as
in
meditation
yet
while
it
is
quite
possible
to
at
least
indicate
maeterlinck
position
as
a
philosopher
it
seems
to
me
premature
to
attempt
to
define
his
position
as
a
dramatist
interesting
as
his
dramatic
work
has
always
been
there
is
in
the
later
dramas
so
singular
an
advance
in
all
the
qualities
that
go
to
make
great
art
that
i
find
it
impossible
at
this
stage
of
his
development
to
treat
his
dramatic
work
as
in
any
sense
the
final
expression
of
a
personality
what
the
next
stage
of
his
development
may
be
it
is
impossible
to
say
he
will
not
write
more
beautiful
dramas
than
he
has
written
in
et
and
in
et
but
he
may
and
he
probably
will
write
something
which
will
move
the
general
world
more
profoundly
touching
it
more
closely
in
the
manner
of
the
great
writers
in
whom
beauty
has
not
been
more
beautiful
than
in
writers
less
great
but
has
come

men
with
a
more

towards
thy

an

towards

mirrored

in

the
sound
when
waters

but
sleep
only
pleasant
dreams
love
enough
for
thinking
of
only
pleasant
dreams
long
live
love
moonlight
over
all
someone
snoring
heavily
moonlight
over
all
in
reality
now
there
comes
a
cloud
it
is
dark
as
midnight
here
now
there
comes
a
cloud
dawn
begins
to
peer
little
lady
mouse
rosy
in
a
ray
of
blue
little
lady
mouse
up
now
all
of
you
chansons
pour
you
believe
that
there
may
be
luck
in
strangers
in
the
tea
i
believe
only
in
your
eyes
you
believe
in
days
one
wins
and
days
one
fails
i
believe
only
in
your
lies
you
believe
in
heavenly
powers
in
some
saint
to
whom
one
prays
or
in
some
ave
that
one
says
i
believe
only
in
the
hours
coloured
with
the
rosy
lights
you
rain
for
me
on
sleepless
nights
and
so
firmly
i
receive
these
for
truth
that
i
believe
that
only
for
your
sake
i
live
when
we
go
together
if
i
may
see
her
again
into
the
dark
wood
and
the
rain
when
we
are
drunken
with
air
and
the
sun
delight
at
the
brink
of
the
river
of
light
when
we
are
homeless
at
last
for
a
moment
space
without
city
or
and
if
the
slow
of
the
world
still
seem
to
cradle
us
in
a
dream
then
let
us
sleep
the
last
sleep
with
no
and
god
will
see
to
the
waking
