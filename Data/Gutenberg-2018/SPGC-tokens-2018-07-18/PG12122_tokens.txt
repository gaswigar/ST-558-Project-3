the
monkey
paw
i
without
the
night
was
cold
and
wet
but
in
the
small
parlour
of
laburnam
villa
the
blinds
were
drawn
and
the
fire
burned
brightly
father
and
son
were
at
chess
the
former
who
possessed
ideas
about
the
game
involving
radical
changes
putting
his
king
into
such
sharp
and
unnecessary
perils
that
it
even
provoked
comment
from
the
old
lady
knitting
placidly
by
the
fire
hark
at
the
wind
said
white
who
having
seen
a
fatal
mistake
after
it
was
too
late
was
amiably
desirous
of
preventing
his
son
from
seeing
it
i
listening
said
the
latter
grimly
surveying
the
board
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
check
i
should
hardly
think
that
he
come
said
his
father
with
his
hand
poised
over
the
board
mate
replied
the
son
that
the
worst
of
living
so
far
out
bawled
white
with
sudden
and
violence
of
all
the
beastly
slushy
places
to
live
in
this
is
the
worst
pathway
a
bog
and
the
road
a
torrent
i
do
know
what
people
are
thinking
about
i
suppose
because
only
two
houses
in
the
road
are
let
they
think
it
does
matter
never
mind
dear
said
his
wife
soothingly
perhaps
you
win
the
next
one
white
looked
up
sharply
just
in
time
to
intercept
a
knowing
glance
between
mother
and
son
the
words
died
away
on
his
lips
and
he
hid
a
guilty
grin
in
his
thin
grey
beard
there
he
is
said
herbert
white
as
the
gate
banged
to
loudly
and
heavy
footsteps
came
toward
the
door
the
old
man
rose
with
hospitable
haste
and
opening
the
door
was
heard
condoling
with
the
new
arrival
the
new
arrival
also
condoled
with
himself
so
that
white
said
tut
tut
and
coughed
gently
as
her
husband
entered
the
room
followed
by
a
tall
burly
man
beady
of
eye
and
rubicund
of
visage
morris
he
said
introducing
him
the
shook
hands
and
taking
the
proffered
seat
by
the
fire
watched
contentedly
while
his
host
got
out
whiskey
and
tumblers
and
stood
a
small
copper
kettle
on
the
fire
at
the
third
glass
his
eyes
got
brighter
and
he
began
to
talk
the
little
family
circle
regarding
with
eager
interest
this
visitor
from
distant
parts
as
he
squared
his
broad
shoulders
in
the
chair
and
spoke
of
wild
scenes
and
doughty
deeds
of
wars
and
plagues
and
strange
peoples
years
of
it
said
white
nodding
at
his
wife
and
son
when
he
went
away
he
was
a
slip
of
a
youth
in
the
warehouse
now
look
at
him
he
do
look
to
have
taken
much
harm
said
white
politely
i
like
to
go
to
india
myself
said
the
old
man
just
to
look
round
a
bit
you
know
better
where
you
are
said
the
shaking
his
head
he
put
down
the
empty
glass
and
sighing
softly
shook
it
again
i
should
like
to
see
those
old
temples
and
fakirs
and
jugglers
said
the
old
man
what
was
that
you
started
telling
me
the
other
day
about
a
monkey
paw
or
something
morris
nothing
said
the
soldier
hastily
leastways
nothing
worth
hearing
monkey
paw
said
white
curiously
well
it
just
a
bit
of
what
you
might
call
magic
perhaps
said
the
offhandedly
his
three
listeners
leaned
forward
eagerly
the
visitor
put
his
empty
glass
to
his
lips
and
then
set
it
down
again
his
host
filled
it
for
him
to
look
at
said
the
fumbling
in
his
pocket
it
just
an
ordinary
little
paw
dried
to
a
mummy
he
took
something
out
of
his
pocket
and
proffered
it
white
drew
back
with
a
grimace
but
her
son
taking
it
examined
it
curiously
and
what
is
there
special
about
it
inquired
white
as
he
took
it
from
his
son
and
having
examined
it
placed
it
upon
the
table
it
had
a
spell
put
on
it
by
an
old
fakir
said
the
a
very
holy
man
he
wanted
to
show
that
fate
ruled
people
lives
and
that
those
who
interfered
with
it
did
so
to
their
sorrow
he
put
a
spell
on
it
so
that
three
separate
men
could
each
have
three
wishes
from
it
his
manner
was
so
impressive
that
his
hearers
were
conscious
that
their
light
laughter
jarred
somewhat
well
why
do
you
have
three
sir
said
herbert
white
cleverly
the
soldier
regarded
him
in
the
way
that
middle
age
is
wont
to
regard
presumptuous
youth
i
have
he
said
quietly
and
his
blotchy
face
whitened
and
did
you
really
have
the
three
wishes
granted
asked
white
i
did
said
the
and
his
glass
tapped
against
his
strong
teeth
and
has
anybody
else
wished
persisted
the
old
lady
the
first
man
had
his
three
wishes
yes
was
the
reply
i
do
know
what
the
first
two
were
but
the
third
was
for
death
that
how
i
got
the
paw
his
tones
were
so
grave
that
a
hush
fell
upon
the
group
if
you
had
your
three
wishes
it
no
good
to
you
now
then
morris
said
the
old
man
at
last
what
do
you
keep
it
for
the
soldier
shook
his
head
fancy
i
suppose
he
said
slowly
i
did
have
some
idea
of
selling
it
but
i
do
think
i
will
it
has
caused
enough
mischief
already
besides
people
wo
buy
they
think
it
a
fairy
tale
some
of
them
and
those
who
do
think
anything
of
it
want
to
try
it
first
and
pay
me
afterward
if
you
could
have
another
three
wishes
said
the
old
man
eyeing
him
keenly
would
you
have
them
i
do
know
said
the
other
i
do
know
he
took
the
paw
and
dangling
it
between
his
forefinger
and
thumb
suddenly
threw
it
upon
the
fire
white
with
a
slight
cry
stooped
down
and
snatched
it
off
better
let
it
burn
said
the
soldier
solemnly
if
you
do
want
it
morris
said
the
other
give
it
to
me
i
wo
said
his
friend
doggedly
i
threw
it
on
the
fire
if
you
keep
it
do
blame
me
for
what
happens
pitch
it
on
the
fire
again
like
a
sensible
man
the
other
shook
his
head
and
examined
his
new
possession
closely
how
do
you
do
it
he
inquired
hold
it
up
in
your
right
hand
and
wish
aloud
said
the
but
i
warn
you
of
the
consequences
sounds
like
the
arabian
nights
said
white
as
she
rose
and
began
to
set
the
supper
do
you
think
you
might
wish
for
four
pairs
of
hands
for
me
her
husband
drew
the
talisman
from
pocket
and
then
all
three
burst
into
laughter
as
the
with
a
look
of
alarm
on
his
face
caught
him
by
the
arm
if
you
must
wish
he
said
gruffly
wish
for
something
sensible
white
dropped
it
back
in
his
pocket
and
placing
chairs
motioned
his
friend
to
the
table
in
the
business
of
supper
the
talisman
was
partly
forgotten
and
afterward
the
three
sat
listening
in
an
enthralled
fashion
to
a
second
instalment
of
the
soldier
adventures
in
india
if
the
tale
about
the
monkey
paw
is
not
more
truthful
than
those
he
has
been
telling
us
said
herbert
as
the
door
closed
behind
their
guest
just
in
time
for
him
to
catch
the
last
train
we
make
much
out
of
it
did
you
give
him
anything
for
it
father
inquired
white
regarding
her
husband
closely
a
trifle
said
he
colouring
slightly
he
did
want
it
but
i
made
him
take
it
and
he
pressed
me
again
to
throw
it
away
likely
said
herbert
with
pretended
horror
why
we
going
to
be
rich
and
famous
and
happy
wish
to
be
an
emperor
father
to
begin
with
then
you
ca
be
henpecked
he
darted
round
the
table
pursued
by
the
maligned
white
armed
with
an
antimacassar
white
took
the
paw
from
his
pocket
and
eyed
it
dubiously
i
know
what
to
wish
for
and
that
a
fact
he
said
slowly
it
seems
to
me
i
got
all
i
want
if
you
only
cleared
the
house
you
be
quite
happy
would
you
said
herbert
with
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
well
wish
for
two
hundred
pounds
then
that
just
do
it
his
father
smiling
shamefacedly
at
his
own
credulity
held
up
the
talisman
as
his
son
with
a
solemn
face
somewhat
marred
by
a
wink
at
his
mother
sat
down
at
the
piano
and
struck
a
few
impressive
chords
i
wish
for
two
hundred
pounds
said
the
old
man
distinctly
a
fine
crash
from
the
piano
greeted
the
words
interrupted
by
a
shuddering
cry
from
the
old
man
his
wife
and
son
ran
toward
him
it
moved
he
cried
with
a
glance
of
disgust
at
the
object
as
it
lay
on
the
floor
as
i
wished
it
twisted
in
my
hand
like
a
snake
well
i
do
see
the
money
said
his
son
as
he
picked
it
up
and
placed
it
on
the
table
and
i
bet
i
never
shall
it
must
have
been
your
fancy
father
said
his
wife
regarding
him
anxiously
he
shook
his
head
never
mind
though
there
no
harm
done
but
it
gave
me
a
shock
all
the
same
they
sat
down
by
the
fire
again
while
the
two
men
finished
their
pipes
outside
the
wind
was
higher
than
ever
and
the
old
man
started
nervously
at
the
sound
of
a
door
banging
upstairs
a
silence
unusual
and
depressing
settled
upon
all
three
which
lasted
until
the
old
couple
rose
to
retire
for
the
night
i
expect
you
find
the
cash
tied
up
in
a
big
bag
in
the
middle
of
your
bed
said
herbert
as
he
bade
them
and
something
horrible
squatting
up
on
top
of
the
wardrobe
watching
you
as
you
pocket
your
gains
he
sat
alone
in
the
darkness
gazing
at
the
dying
fire
and
seeing
faces
in
it
the
last
face
was
so
horrible
and
so
simian
that
he
gazed
at
it
in
amazement
it
got
so
vivid
that
with
a
little
uneasy
laugh
he
felt
on
the
table
for
a
glass
containing
a
little
water
to
throw
over
it
his
hand
grasped
the
monkey
paw
and
with
a
little
shiver
he
wiped
his
hand
on
his
coat
and
went
up
to
bed
ii
in
the
brightness
of
the
wintry
sun
next
morning
as
it
streamed
over
the
breakfast
table
he
laughed
at
his
fears
there
was
an
air
of
prosaic
wholesomeness
about
the
room
which
it
had
lacked
on
the
previous
night
and
the
dirty
shrivelled
little
paw
was
pitched
on
the
sideboard
with
a
carelessness
which
betokened
no
great
belief
in
its
virtues
i
suppose
all
old
soldiers
are
the
same
said
white
the
idea
of
our
listening
to
such
nonsense
how
could
wishes
be
granted
in
these
days
and
if
they
could
how
could
two
hundred
pounds
hurt
you
father
might
drop
on
his
head
from
the
sky
said
the
frivolous
herbert
morris
said
the
things
happened
so
naturally
said
his
father
that
you
might
if
you
so
wished
attribute
it
to
coincidence
well
do
break
into
the
money
before
i
come
back
said
herbert
as
he
rose
from
the
table
i
afraid
it
turn
you
into
a
mean
avaricious
man
and
we
shall
have
to
disown
you
his
mother
laughed
and
following
him
to
the
door
watched
him
down
the
road
and
returning
to
the
breakfast
table
was
very
happy
at
the
expense
of
her
husband
credulity
all
of
which
did
not
prevent
her
from
scurrying
to
the
door
at
the
postman
knock
nor
prevent
her
from
referring
somewhat
shortly
to
retired
of
bibulous
habits
when
she
found
that
the
post
brought
a
tailor
bill
herbert
will
have
some
more
of
his
funny
remarks
i
expect
when
he
comes
home
she
said
as
they
sat
at
dinner
i
dare
say
said
white
pouring
himself
out
some
beer
but
for
all
that
the
thing
moved
in
my
hand
that
i
swear
to
you
thought
it
did
said
the
old
lady
soothingly
i
say
it
did
replied
the
other
there
was
no
thought
about
it
i
had
just
what
the
matter
his
wife
made
no
reply
she
was
watching
the
mysterious
movements
of
a
man
outside
who
peering
in
an
undecided
fashion
at
the
house
appeared
to
be
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
to
enter
in
mental
connection
with
the
two
hundred
pounds
she
noticed
that
the
stranger
was
well
dressed
and
wore
a
silk
hat
of
glossy
newness
three
times
he
paused
at
the
gate
and
then
walked
on
again
the
fourth
time
he
stood
with
his
hand
upon
it
and
then
with
sudden
resolution
flung
it
open
and
walked
up
the
path
white
at
the
same
moment
placed
her
hands
behind
her
and
hurriedly
unfastening
the
strings
of
her
apron
put
that
useful
article
of
apparel
beneath
the
cushion
of
her
chair
she
brought
the
stranger
who
seemed
ill
at
ease
into
the
room
he
gazed
at
her
furtively
and
listened
in
a
preoccupied
fashion
as
the
old
lady
apologized
for
the
appearance
of
the
room
and
her
husband
coat
a
garment
which
he
usually
reserved
for
the
garden
she
then
waited
as
patiently
as
her
sex
would
permit
for
him
to
broach
his
business
but
he
was
at
first
strangely
silent
i
was
asked
to
call
he
said
at
last
and
stooped
and
picked
a
piece
of
cotton
from
his
trousers
i
come
from
and
meggins
the
old
lady
started
is
anything
the
matter
she
asked
breathlessly
has
anything
happened
to
herbert
what
is
it
what
is
it
her
husband
interposed
there
there
mother
he
said
hastily
sit
down
and
do
jump
to
conclusions
you
not
brought
bad
news
sure
sir
and
he
eyed
the
other
wistfully
i
sorry
began
the
visitor
is
he
hurt
demanded
the
mother
wildly
the
visitor
bowed
in
assent
badly
hurt
he
said
quietly
but
he
is
not
in
any
pain
oh
thank
god
said
the
old
woman
clasping
her
hands
thank
god
for
that
thank
she
broke
off
suddenly
as
the
sinister
meaning
of
the
assurance
dawned
upon
her
and
she
saw
the
awful
confirmation
of
her
fears
in
the
averted
face
she
caught
her
breath
and
turning
to
her
husband
laid
her
trembling
old
hand
upon
his
there
was
a
long
silence
he
was
caught
in
the
machinery
said
the
visitor
at
length
in
a
low
voice
caught
in
the
machinery
repeated
white
in
a
dazed
fashion
yes
he
sat
staring
blankly
out
at
the
window
and
taking
his
wife
hand
between
his
own
pressed
it
as
he
had
been
wont
to
do
in
their
old
nearly
forty
years
before
he
was
the
only
one
left
to
us
he
said
turning
gently
to
the
visitor
it
is
hard
the
other
coughed
and
rising
walked
slowly
to
the
window
the
firm
wished
me
to
convey
their
sincere
sympathy
with
you
in
your
great
loss
he
said
without
looking
round
i
beg
that
you
will
understand
i
am
only
their
servant
and
merely
obeying
orders
there
was
no
reply
the
old
woman
face
was
white
her
eyes
staring
and
her
breath
inaudible
on
the
husband
face
was
a
look
such
as
his
friend
the
sergeant
might
have
carried
into
his
first
action
i
was
to
say
that
and
meggins
disclaim
all
responsibility
continued
the
other
they
admit
no
liability
at
all
but
in
consideration
of
your
son
services
they
wish
to
present
you
with
a
certain
sum
as
compensation
white
dropped
his
wife
hand
and
rising
to
his
feet
gazed
with
a
look
of
horror
at
his
visitor
his
dry
lips
shaped
the
words
how
much
two
hundred
pounds
was
the
answer
unconscious
of
his
wife
shriek
the
old
man
smiled
faintly
put
out
his
hands
like
a
sightless
man
and
dropped
a
senseless
heap
to
the
floor
iii
in
the
huge
new
cemetery
some
two
miles
distant
the
old
people
buried
their
dead
and
came
back
to
a
house
steeped
in
shadow
and
silence
it
was
all
over
so
quickly
that
at
first
they
could
hardly
realize
it
and
remained
in
a
state
of
expectation
as
though
of
something
else
to
happen
something
else
which
was
to
lighten
this
load
too
heavy
for
old
hearts
to
bear
but
the
days
passed
and
expectation
gave
place
to
resignation
the
hopeless
resignation
of
the
old
sometimes
miscalled
apathy
sometimes
they
hardly
exchanged
a
word
for
now
they
had
nothing
to
talk
about
and
their
days
were
long
to
weariness
it
was
about
a
week
after
that
the
old
man
waking
suddenly
in
the
night
stretched
out
his
hand
and
found
himself
alone
the
room
was
in
darkness
and
the
sound
of
subdued
weeping
came
from
the
window
he
raised
himself
in
bed
and
listened
come
back
he
said
tenderly
you
will
be
cold
it
is
colder
for
my
son
said
the
old
woman
and
wept
afresh
the
sound
of
her
sobs
died
away
on
his
ears
the
bed
was
warm
and
his
eyes
heavy
with
sleep
he
dozed
fitfully
and
then
slept
until
a
sudden
wild
cry
from
his
wife
awoke
him
with
a
start
the
paw
she
cried
wildly
the
monkey
paw
he
started
up
in
alarm
where
where
is
it
what
the
matter
she
came
stumbling
across
the
room
toward
him
i
want
it
she
said
quietly
you
not
destroyed
it
it
in
the
parlour
on
the
bracket
he
replied
marvelling
why
she
cried
and
laughed
together
and
bending
over
kissed
his
cheek
i
only
just
thought
of
it
she
said
hysterically
why
did
i
think
of
it
before
why
did
you
think
of
it
think
of
what
he
questioned
the
other
two
wishes
she
replied
rapidly
we
only
had
one
was
not
that
enough
he
demanded
fiercely
no
she
cried
triumphantly
we
have
one
more
go
down
and
get
it
quickly
and
wish
our
boy
alive
again
the
man
sat
up
in
bed
and
flung
the
bedclothes
from
his
quaking
limbs
good
god
you
are
mad
he
cried
aghast
get
it
she
panted
get
it
quickly
and
wish
oh
my
boy
my
boy
her
husband
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
candle
get
back
to
bed
he
said
unsteadily
you
do
know
what
you
are
saying
we
had
the
first
wish
granted
said
the
old
woman
feverishly
why
not
the
second
a
coincidence
stammered
the
old
man
go
and
get
it
and
wish
cried
his
wife
quivering
with
excitement
the
old
man
turned
and
regarded
her
and
his
voice
shook
he
has
been
dead
ten
days
and
besides
he
i
would
not
tell
you
else
but
i
could
only
recognize
him
by
his
clothing
if
he
was
too
terrible
for
you
to
see
then
how
now
bring
him
back
cried
the
old
woman
and
dragged
him
toward
the
door
do
you
think
i
fear
the
child
i
have
nursed
he
went
down
in
the
darkness
and
felt
his
way
to
the
parlour
and
then
to
the
mantelpiece
the
talisman
was
in
its
place
and
a
horrible
fear
that
the
unspoken
wish
might
bring
his
mutilated
son
before
him
ere
he
could
escape
from
the
room
seized
upon
him
and
he
caught
his
breath
as
he
found
that
he
had
lost
the
direction
of
the
door
his
brow
cold
with
sweat
he
felt
his
way
round
the
table
and
groped
along
the
wall
until
he
found
himself
in
the
small
passage
with
the
unwholesome
thing
in
his
hand
even
his
wife
face
seemed
changed
as
he
entered
the
room
it
was
white
and
expectant
and
to
his
fears
seemed
to
have
an
unnatural
look
upon
it
he
was
afraid
of
her
wish
she
cried
in
a
strong
voice
it
is
foolish
and
wicked
he
faltered
wish
repeated
his
wife
he
raised
his
hand
i
wish
my
son
alive
again
the
talisman
fell
to
the
floor
and
he
regarded
it
fearfully
then
he
sank
trembling
into
a
chair
as
the
old
woman
with
burning
eyes
walked
to
the
window
and
raised
the
blind
he
sat
until
he
was
chilled
with
the
cold
glancing
occasionally
at
the
figure
of
the
old
woman
peering
through
the
window
the
which
had
burned
below
the
rim
of
the
china
candlestick
was
throwing
pulsating
shadows
on
the
ceiling
and
walls
until
with
a
flicker
larger
than
the
rest
it
expired
the
old
man
with
an
unspeakable
sense
of
relief
at
the
failure
of
the
talisman
crept
back
to
his
bed
and
a
minute
or
two
afterward
the
old
woman
came
silently
and
apathetically
beside
him
neither
spoke
but
lay
silently
listening
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
a
stair
creaked
and
a
squeaky
mouse
scurried
noisily
through
the
wall
the
darkness
was
oppressive
and
after
lying
for
some
time
screwing
up
his
courage
he
took
the
box
of
matches
and
striking
one
went
downstairs
for
a
candle
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
match
went
out
and
he
paused
to
strike
another
and
at
the
same
moment
a
knock
so
quiet
and
stealthy
as
to
be
scarcely
audible
sounded
on
the
front
door
the
matches
fell
from
his
hand
and
spilled
in
the
passage
he
stood
motionless
his
breath
suspended
until
the
knock
was
repeated
then
he
turned
and
fled
swiftly
back
to
his
room
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
a
third
knock
sounded
through
the
house
what
that
cried
the
old
woman
starting
up
a
rat
said
the
old
man
in
shaking
tones
a
rat
it
passed
me
on
the
stairs
his
wife
sat
up
in
bed
listening
a
loud
knock
resounded
through
the
house
it
herbert
she
screamed
it
herbert
she
ran
to
the
door
but
her
husband
was
before
her
and
catching
her
by
the
arm
held
her
tightly
what
are
you
going
to
do
he
whispered
hoarsely
it
my
boy
it
herbert
she
cried
struggling
mechanically
i
forgot
it
was
two
miles
away
what
are
you
holding
me
for
let
go
i
must
open
the
door
for
god
sake
do
let
it
in
cried
the
old
man
trembling
you
afraid
of
your
own
son
she
cried
struggling
let
me
go
coming
herbert
i
coming
there
was
another
knock
and
another
the
old
woman
with
a
sudden
wrench
broke
free
and
ran
from
the
room
her
husband
followed
to
the
landing
and
called
after
her
appealingly
as
she
hurried
downstairs
he
heard
the
chain
rattle
back
and
the
bottom
bolt
drawn
slowly
and
stiffly
from
the
socket
then
the
old
woman
voice
strained
and
panting
the
bolt
she
cried
loudly
come
down
i
ca
reach
it
but
her
husband
was
on
his
hands
and
knees
groping
wildly
on
the
floor
in
search
of
the
paw
if
he
could
only
find
it
before
the
thing
outside
got
in
a
perfect
fusillade
of
knocks
reverberated
through
the
house
and
he
heard
the
scraping
of
a
chair
as
his
wife
put
it
down
in
the
passage
against
the
door
he
heard
the
creaking
of
the
bolt
as
it
came
slowly
back
and
at
the
same
moment
he
found
the
monkey
paw
and
frantically
breathed
his
third
and
last
wish
the
knocking
ceased
suddenly
although
the
echoes
of
it
were
still
in
the
house
he
heard
the
chair
drawn
back
and
the
door
opened
a
cold
wind
rushed
up
the
staircase
and
a
long
loud
wail
of
disappointment
and
misery
from
his
wife
gave
him
courage
to
run
down
to
her
side
and
then
to
the
gate
beyond
the
street
lamp
flickering
opposite
shone
on
a
quiet
and
deserted
road
