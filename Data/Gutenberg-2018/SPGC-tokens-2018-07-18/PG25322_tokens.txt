never

once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
slim
girl
with
a
forehead
which
was
shiny
and
protuberant
like
a
bartlett
pear
when
asked
to
put
something
in
an
autograph
album
she
invariably
wrote
the
following
in
a
tall
dislocated
life
is
real
life
is
earnest
and
the
grave
is
not
its
goal
that
the
kind
of
a
girl
she
was
in
her
own
town
she
had
the
name
of
being
a
cold
proposition
but
that
was
because
the
primitive
yokels
of
a
stand
could
not
attune
themselves
to
the
views
of
one
who
was
troubled
with
ideals
her
soul
panted
for
the
higher
life
alas
the
rube
town
in
which
she
hung
forth
was

croquet

sociables
a
lodge
of
elks
and
two
married
preachers
who
doctored
for
the
tonsilitis
so
what
could
the
poor
girl
do
in
all
the
country
around
there
was
not
a
man
who
came
up
to
her
plans
and
specifications
for
a
husband
neither
was
there
any
man
who
had
any
time
for
her
so
she
led
a
lonely
life
dreaming
of
the
one

ideal

was
a
big
and
pensive
literary
man
wearing
a
prince
albert
coat
a
neat
derby
hat
and
godlike
whiskers
when
he
came
he
would
enfold
her
in
his
arms
and
whisper

to
her

cold
proposition
but
the
party
failed
to
show
up
often
enough
she
put
on
her
chip
hat
and
her
black
lisle
gloves
and
sauntered
down
to
look
at
the
gang
sitting
in
front
of
the
occidental
hotel
hoping
that
the
real
thing
would
be
there
but
she
always
saw
the
same
old
line
of
drummers
from
chicago
and
louis
smoking
horrid
cigars
and
talking
about
the
percentages
of
the
league
teams
she
knew
that
these
gross
creatures
were
not
prone
to
chase
mere
intellectual
splendor
so
she
made
no
effort
to
flag
them

after

had
read
about

it
in

morning
when
she
showed
up
on

she
looked

enough
to
push
her
in

he
stood

skated
off
into
the
woods
to
hear
a
man
with
a
black
alpaca
coat
lecture
to
the
high
foreheads
about
the
subverted
ego
he
used
to
go
out
with
a
few
friends
and
tell
them
his
troubles
and
weep
into
his
beer
they
would
slap
him
on
the
back

tell
him
she
was
a
nice
woman

he
knew
better
annyhow
as
bobby
gaylor
used
to
say
she
became
restless
around
the
house
with
nothing
to
do
except
her
husband
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
be
benevolent
to
beat
the
band

decided
that
she
would
allow
the
glory
of
her
presence
to
burst
upon
the

uncultured
it
would
be
a
big
help
to
the
poor

uncultured

what
a

lady
was
like
she
did
propose
to
put
on
old
clothes
and
go
and
live
with
poor
people
and
be
one
of
them
and
nurse
their
sick
as
they
do
in
settlements
not
on
your
previous
existence
she
was
going
to
be
benevolent
and
be
dead
swell
at
the
same
time
accordingly
she
would
lace
herself
until
she
was
the
shape
of
a
bass
viol
and
put
on
her
and
the
hat
that
made
her
face
seem
longer
and
then
she
would
gallop
forth
to
do
things
to
the
poor
she
always
carried
a
lorgnette
in
one
hand
and
a
in
the
other

she
would

the

numbered
with

after

had

she
would
say

would
reply
that

one
within
the
sound

his
voice
remembered
what
quarolius
had

who
disputed
the
contention
of
the
great
persian
theologian
ramtazuk
that
the
soul
in
its
reaching
out
after
the
unknowable
was
guided
by
the
spiritual
genesis

motive
rather
than
by

impulse

this

said
how
true
this
is

not
a
parishioner

an
eye
it
was
amebius

immortal
lines
he
recited
in

to
prove
the
extreme
error
of
the
position
assumed
in
the
controversy
by
the
famous
italian
polenta
he
had
them
going
and
there
was
a
thing
to
it
when
he
would
get
tired
of
faking
philosophy
he
would
quote
from
a
celebrated
poet
of
ecuador
or
tasmania
or
some
other
seaport
town
compared
with
this
verse
all
of
which
was

school

masterpiece

passage

front

store

after
the
colored
boy
gets
through
using
the
chamois
after
that
he
became
eloquent
and
began
to
get
rid
of
long
boston
words
that
had
been
used
before
that
season
he
grabbed
a
rhetorical
roman
candle
in
each
hand
and
you
could
see
him
for
the
sparks
after
which
he
sunk
his
voice
to
a
whisper
and
talked
about
the
birds
and
the
flowers
then
although
there
was
no
cue
for
him
to
weep
he
shed
a
few
real
tears
and
there
was
a
dry
glove
in
the
church
after
he
sat
down
he
could
tell
by
the
scared
look
of
the
people
in
front
that
he
had
made
a
did

give
him
the
joyous
palm

day

stout
lady
could
not
control
her
feelings

she
told
how
much
the
sermon
had
helped
her
the
venerable
harness
dealer
said
he
wished
to
indorse
the
able
and
scholarly
criticism
of
polenta
in
fact
every
one
said
the
sermon
was
superfine
and
dandy
the
only
thing
that
worried
the
congregation
was
the
fear
that
if
it
wished
to
retain
such
a
whale
it
might
have
to
boost
his
salary

joyous

preacher
waited
for
some
one
to
come
and
ask
about
polenta
amebius
ramtazuk
quarolius
and
the
great
icelandic
poet

no
one
had
the
face
to
step
up
and
confess
his
ignorance

did
even
admit
among
themselves
that
the
preacher
had
rung
in
some
new
ones
they
stood

merely
said

they
decided

they
became

the

had

said

than

some

had
been

up

wrote
that
zoroaster

ought
to
be
on
an
ice
wagon
instead
of
on

they
would
get
out

read

went

the
day
the

came
to

important
changes

changed
his
whiskers
from
green
to
blue
at

zendavesta
all
during

seventeen
years
zoroaster

zendavesta
continued
to
walk
chesty
and
tell
people
how
good
they
were
they
never
could
understand
why
the
public
stood
for
mansfield
when
it
could
get
zoroaster
and
zendavesta
the
property
man
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
mansfield
conned
the
critics
zendavesta
said
there
was
only
one
critic
on
the
square
and
he
was
at
paducah
when
the
vodeville
craze
came
along
zoroaster
and
zendavesta
took
their
paducah
scrap
book
over
to
a
manager
and
he
booked
them

assured
the
manager
that
him
and
his
partner
done
a
refined
act
suitable
for
women
and
children
with
a
strong
finish
which
had
been
the
talk

loses

goes

zendavesta
came
on
very
cocky
and
for
the
time
zoroaster
asked
zendavesta
who
wuz
it
i
seen
you
comin
up
the
street
with
then
for
the

by
way

kicked

in

was

zoroaster

were
very
sore
at
having
their

killed
they
said
it
was
no

the

told
them
they
were
too
tart
for
words
to
tell
it
and
to
consider
themselves

back
into

the

we
will
take
it
for

your
innocence

made
it
a

for

that
you
had

us
have

told

kind

while
her
lawyer
wept
illustration

he
was
ready
to
weep
for
anyone
who
would
hand
him

make
it
it
was
a
dark
tale
of
how
botts
the
viperish
defendant
had
sneered
at
her
called

humiliated
her
in
the
presence
of
callers
and
nagged
her
with
sarcastic
comments
until
her
tender
sensibilities
had
been
worn
to
a
frazzle
then
the
defendant
went
on
the
stand
and
entered
a
general
denial
he
had
been
all
that
a
rattling
good
husband
could
be
but
she
had
been

had

had

there
is
more
in

than

said
the
modern
solomon
in
order
to
fix
the
blame
we
shall
have
to
dig
up
the
first
cause
i
will
ask
chemical
flora
to
tell
us
the
story
of
her
past
life
my
parents
were
poor
but
refined
said
botts
they
gave
me
every
advantage
after
i
finished
the
high
school
i
attended
a
conservatory
and
every
one
said
i
had
talent
i
should
have
been
an
elocutionist
once
i
went
to
rockford
and
recited
the
tramp
story
at
a
club
social
and
i
got
a
lovely
notice
i
am
especially
good
at
dialect
recitations
humorous
asked
the
court
yes
sir
but
i
can
turn
right
around
and
be
pathetic
all
of
a
sudden
if
i
want
to
be
illustration
chemical
flora
i
suppose
that
botts
after
he
had
lived
with
you
for
awhile
have
any
hankering
desire
to
hear
you
recite
suggested
the
modern
solomon
that
just
it
when
i
offer
to
get
up
in
company
and
speak
something
he
ask
me
please
not
to
recite
and
if
i
had
to
make
a
show
of
myself
for
god
sake
not
to
tackle
anything
humorous
with
a
conservatory
dialect
to
it
but
you
would
let
him
stop
you
not
on
your
life
i
believe
you
even
if
you
was
under
oath
now
will
botts
answer
me
one
question
has
he
any
ambition
on
the
side
although
i
am
a
bookkeeper
for
a
concern
i
have
always
believed
i
could
write
replied
adolph
botts
about
four
years
ago
i
began
to
prepare
the
book
for
a
comic
opera
a
friend
of
mine
who
works
in
a
hat
store
was
to
compose
the
music
i
think
he
has
more
ability
than
victor
herbert
did
this
friend
think
well
of
your
libretto
asked
the
wise
judge
yes
sir
he
said
it
was
the
best
thing
that
had
been
done
since
in
fact
everybody
liked
my
book
except
your
wife
suggested
the
court
that
it
exactly
i
wanted
sympathy
and
encouragement
and
she
gave
me
the
metallic
laugh
there
is
one
patter
song
in
my
opera
that
every
one
who
comes
to
my
house
has
been
crazy
to
hear
whenever
i
started
to
sing
it
she
would
talk
in
a
loud
voice
she
never
seemed
to
appreciate
my
stuff
i
think
the
bleach
affected
her
head

the
opera
been

approached

was
a
scrapper
who
had
been
fairly
successful
at
one

but
had
ceased

years
before

the
coming

when
he
arrived
in
town
it
was
evident
that
he
lacked
condition
he
had
been
dieting
himself
on
pie
and
beer
and
any
expert
such
as
the
cigar
store
man
could
tell
by
looking
at
him
that
his
abdomen
was
not
hard
enough
to
withstand
those
crushing
body
blows
such
as
the
boy
was
in
the
habit
of
landing
on
the
punching
bag
accordingly
the
word
went
around
that
the
imported
pug
was
too
fat
and
had
bad
wind
it
began
to
resemble
a
cinch
the
manager
went
out
and
bet
more
money
and
the
coming
champion
was
nervous
for
fear
that
he
would
kill
the
if
he
connected
too
strong
on
the
point
of
the
jaw
he
thought
it
would
be
better
to
wear
him
down
with
blows
and
make
him
quit

had
read
that
it
was
dangerous
to
punish
a
physical
wreck
who
might
have
heart
trouble
or
something
like
that
the
boy
was
a
professional
pugilist
but
he
had
humane
instincts
when
the
boy
came
to
the
train
which
was
to
carry
the
participants
and
the
spectators
to
the
he
was
attended
by
four
comrades
who
had
ice
beef
tea
brandy
alcohol
blankets
and
other
paraphernalia
they
made
a
couch
for
him
in
the
baggage
car

had
him
lie
down
so
that
he
might
conserve
all
his
strength
and
step
into
the
ring
as
fresh
as
possible
the
unknown
had
no
one
to
handle
him
he
sat
alone
in
the
men
car
with
a
queer
telescope
valise
on
his
knees
and
he
smoked
a
cigarette
which
was
in
direct
violation
of
all
the
rules
of
training
at
last
the
company
arrived
at
the
secluded
spot
and
a
ring
was
staked
out

received
with
loud

looked
over

remarked
to
the
undertaker
that
he
the
coming
champion
seemed
to
be
a
nice
young
fellow
after
which
he
yawned
slightly
and
wanted
to
know
what
time
they
would
get
a

back
to
town
the
bell
rang
and
there
in
the
center
of
the
ring
stood
the
tottering
and
the

the
was
crouched
with
his
head
drawn
in
his
legs
spraddled
and
oh
the
hard
vicious
expression
on
that
face
as
he
fiddled
short
and
looked
intently
at
the
coming
champion
feet
this
was
a
very
confusing
and
unprofessional
thing
to
do
as
the
boy
had
not
been
accustomed
to
boxing
with
people
who
looked
at
his
feet
he
wondered
if
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
his
gymnasium
shoes
in
a
moment
or
two
he
saw
that
the
physical
wreck
was
afraid
to
lead
so
he
did
some
nimble
foot
work

a

a
very
attractive
debutante
knew
two
young

who
called
on

every
thursday
evening
and
brought

mandolins
along
they
were
conventional
young
men

kind
that
you

wearing
spring
overcoats
in

one
was

the
mothers

often
remarked
what
perfect
manners
fred

eustace
have
merely
as
an
aside
it
may
be
added
that
fred
and
eustace
were
more
popular
with
the
mothers
than
they
were
with
the
younger
set
although
no
one
could
say
a
word
against
either
of
them
only
it
was
rumored
in
keen
society
that
they
did
belong
the
fact
that
they
went
calling
in

crowd

took
their
mandolins
along

give
the
acute
reader
some
idea
of
the
life
that
fred
and
eustace
held
out
to
the
young
women
of
their
acquaintance
the
debutante
name
was
myrtle
her
parents
were
very
watchful
and
did
not
encourage
her
to
receive
callers
except
such
as
were
known
to
be
exemplary
young
men
fred
and
eustace
were
a
few
of
those
who
escaped
the
black
list
myrtle
always
appeared
to
be
glad
to
see
them
and
they
regarded
her
as
a
darned
swell
girl
illustration
myrtle
fred
cousin
came
from
paul
on
a
visit
and
one
day
in
the
street
he
saw
myrtle
and
noticed
that
fred
tipped
his
hat
and
gave
her
a
stage
smile
oh
queen
of
sheba
exclaimed
the
cousin
from
paul
whose
name
was
gus
as
he
stood
stock
still
and
watched
myrtle
reversible

disappear
around
a
corner
she
a
bird
do
you
know
her
well
i
know
her
quite
well
replied
fred
coldly
she
is
a
charming
girl
she
is
all
of
that
you
a
great
describer
and
now
what
night
are
you
going
to
take
me
around
to
call
on
her
fred
very
naturally
hemmed
and
hawed
it
must
be
remembered
that
myrtle
was
a
member
of
an
excellent
family
and
had
been
schooled
in
the
proprieties
and
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
she
would
crave
the
society
of
slangy
old
gus
who
had
an
abounding
nerve
and
furthermore
was
as
fresh
as
the
mountain
air
he
was
the
kind
of
fellow
who
would
see
a
girl
twice
and
then
upon
meeting
her
the
third
time
he
would
go
up
and
straighten
her
cravat
for
her
and
call
her
by
her
first
name
put
him
into
a
strange
company
en
route
to
a
picnic
and
by
the
time
the
baskets
were
unpacked
he
would
have
a
blonde
all
to
himself
and
she
would
have
traded
her
fan
for
his
college
pin
if
a
on
the
street
happened
to
glance
at
him
hard
he
would
run
up
and
seize
her
by
the
hand
and
convince
her
that
they
had
met
and
he
always
got
away
with
it
too
in
a
department
store
while
waiting
for
the
cash
boy
to
come
back
with
the
change
he
would
find
out
the
girl
name
her
favorite
flower
and
where
a
letter
would
reach
her
upon
entering
a
parlor
car
at
paul
he
would
select
a
chair
next
to
the
most
promising
one
in
sight
and
ask
her
if
she
cared
to
have
the
shade
lowered
before
the
train
cleared
the
yards
he
would
have
the
porter
bringing
a
for
the
lady
at
hastings
he
would
be
asking
her
if
she
wanted
something
to
read
at
red
wing
he
would
be
telling
her
that
she
resembled
maxine
elliott
and
showing
her
his
watch
left
to
him
by
his
grandfather
a
prominent
virginian
illustration
fred
and
eustace
at
la
crosse
he
would
be
reading
the
menu
card
to
her
and
telling
her
how
different
it
is
when
you
have
some
one
to
join
you
in
a
bite
at
milwaukee
he
would
go
out
and
buy
a
bouquet
for
her
and
when
they
rode
into
chicago
they
would
be
looking
out
of
the
same
window
and
he
would
be
arranging
for
her
baggage
with
the
transfer
man
after
that
they
would
be
old
friends
now
fred
and
eustace
had
been
at
school
with
gus
and
they
had
seen
his
work
and
they
were
not
disposed
to
introduce
him
into
one
of
the
most
exclusive
homes
in
the
city
they
had
known
myrtle
for
many
years
but
they
did
not
dare
to
address
her
by
her
first
name
and
they
were
positive
that
if
gus
attempted
any
of
his
usual
tactics
with
her
she
would
be
offended
and
naturally
enough
they
would
be
blamed
for
bringing
him
to
the
house
but
gus
insisted
he
said
he
had
seen
myrtle
and
she
suited
him
from
the
ground
up
and
he
proposed
to
have
friendly
doings
with
her
at
last
they
told
him
they
would
take
him
if
he
promised
to
behave
fred
warned
him
that
myrtle
would
frown
down
any
attempt
to
be
familiar
on
short
acquaintance
and
eustace
said
that
as
long
as
he
had
known
myrtle
he
had
never
presumed
to
be
free
and
forward
with
her
he
had
simply
played
the
mandolin
that
was
as
far
along
as
he
had
ever
got
gus
told
them
not
to
worry
about
him
all
he
asked
was
a
start
he
said
he
was
a
willing
performer
but
as
yet
he
never
had
been
disqualified
for
crowding
fred
and
eustace
took
this
to
mean
that
he
would
not
overplay
his
attentions
so
they
escorted
him
to
the
house
as
soon
as
he
had
been
presented
gus
showed
her
where
to
sit
on
the
sofa
then
he
placed
himself
about
six
inches
away
and
began
to
buzz
looking
her
straight
in
the
eye
he
said
that
when
he
first
saw
her
he
mistook
her
for
miss
prentice
who
was
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
paul
only
when
he
came
closer
he
saw
that
it
could
be
miss
prentice
because
miss
prentice
did
have
such
lovely
hair
then
he
asked
her
the
month
of
her
birth
and
told
her
fortune
thereby
coming
nearer
to
holding
her
hand
within
eight
minutes
than
eustace
had
come
in
a
lifetime
illustration

willing
performer
play
something
boys
he
ordered
just
as
if
he
had
paid
them
money
to
come
along
and
make
music
for
him
they
unlimbered
their
mandolins
and
began
to
play
a
sousa
march
he
asked
myrtle
if
she
had
seen
the
new
moon
she
replied
that
she
had
not
so
they
went
outside
when
fred
and
eustace
finished
the
first
piece
gus
appeared
at
the
open
window
and
asked
them
to
play
the
georgia
which
had
always
been
one
of
his
favorites
so
they
played
that
and
when
they
had
concluded
there
came
a
voice
from
the
outer
darkness
and
it
was
the
voice
of
myrtle
she
said
i
tell
you
what
to
play
play
the
intermezzo
fred
and
eustace
exchanged
glances
they
began
to
perceive
that
they
had
been
backed
into
a
siding
with
a
few
potted
palms
in
front
of
them
and
two
cards
from
the
union
they
would
have
been
just
the
same
as
a
hired
orchestra
but
they
played
the
intermezzo
and
felt
peevish
then
they
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
gus
and
myrtle
were
sitting
in
the
hammock
which
had
quite
a
pitch
toward
the
center
gus
had
braced
himself
by
holding
to
the
back
of
the
hammock
he
did
not
have
his
arm
around
myrtle
but
he
had
it
extended
in
a
line
parallel
with
her
back
what
he
had
done
would
justify
a
girl
in
saying
sir
but
it
started
a
real
scandal
with
fred
and
eustace
they
saw
that
the
only
way
to
get
even
with
her
was
to
go
home
without
saying
good
night
so
they
slipped
out
the
side
door
shivering
with
indignation
after
that
for
several
weeks
gus
kept
myrtle
so
busy
that
she
had
no
time
to
think
of
considering
other
candidates
he
sent
books
to
her
mother
and
allowed
the
old
gentleman
to
take
chips
away
from
him
at
poker
they
were
married
in
the
autumn
and
took
gus
into
the
firm

that
he
had
needed

kill
time

reading
novels
until
he
discovered
that
all
books

were
a
mockery
after
a
prolonged
experience
he
came
to
know
that
every
specimen
