monday
or
tuesday
a
haunted
house
whatever
hour
you
woke
there
was
a
door
shutting
from
room
to
room
they
went
hand
in
hand
lifting
here
opening
there
making
sure
a
ghostly
couple
here
we
left
it
she
said
and
he
added
oh
but
here
too
upstairs
she
murmured
and
in
the
garden
he
whispered
quietly
they
said
or
we
shall
wake
them
but
it
was
that
you
woke
us
oh
no
they
looking
for
it
drawing
the
curtain
one
might
say
and
so
read
on
a
page
or
two
now
they
found
it
one
would
be
certain
stopping
the
pencil
on
the
margin
and
then
tired
of
reading
one
might
rise
and
see
for
oneself
the
house
all
empty
the
doors
standing
open
only
the
wood
pigeons
bubbling
with
content
and
the
hum
of
the
threshing
machine
sounding
from
the
farm
what
did
i
come
in
here
for
what
did
i
want
to
find
my
hands
were
empty
perhaps
it
upstairs
then
the
apples
were
in
the
loft
and
so
down
again
the
garden
still
as
ever
only
the
book
had
slipped
into
the
grass
but
they
had
found
it
in
the
drawing
room
not
that
one
could
ever
see
them
the
window
panes
reflected
apples
reflected
roses
all
the
leaves
were
green
in
the
glass
if
they
moved
in
the
drawing
room
the
apple
only
turned
its
yellow
side
yet
the
moment
after
if
the
door
was
opened
spread
about
the
floor
hung
upon
the
walls
pendant
from
the
ceiling
what
my
hands
were
empty
the
shadow
of
a
thrush
crossed
the
carpet
from
the
deepest
wells
of
silence
the
wood
pigeon
drew
its
bubble
of
sound
safe
safe
safe
the
pulse
of
the
house
beat
softly
the
treasure
buried
the
room
the
pulse
stopped
short
oh
was
that
the
buried
treasure
a
moment
later
the
light
had
faded
out
in
the
garden
then
but
the
trees
spun
darkness
for
a
wandering
beam
of
sun
so
fine
so
rare
coolly
sunk
beneath
the
surface
the
beam
i
sought
always
burnt
behind
the
glass
death
was
the
glass
death
was
between
us
coming
to
the
woman
first
hundreds
of
years
ago
leaving
the
house
sealing
all
the
windows
the
rooms
were
darkened
he
left
it
left
her
went
north
went
east
saw
the
stars
turned
in
the
southern
sky
sought
the
house
found
it
dropped
beneath
the
downs
safe
safe
safe
the
pulse
of
the
house
beat
gladly
the
treasure
yours
the
wind
roars
up
the
avenue
trees
stoop
and
bend
this
way
and
that
moonbeams
splash
and
spill
wildly
in
the
rain
but
the
beam
of
the
lamp
falls
straight
from
the
window
the
candle
burns
stiff
and
still
wandering
through
the
house
opening
the
windows
whispering
not
to
wake
us
the
ghostly
couple
seek
their
joy
here
we
slept
she
says
and
he
adds
kisses
without
number
waking
in
the
morning
silver
between
the
trees
upstairs
in
the
garden
when
summer
came
in
winter
snowtime
the
doors
go
shutting
far
in
the
distance
gently
knocking
like
the
pulse
of
a
heart
nearer
they
come
cease
at
the
doorway
the
wind
falls
the
rain
slides
silver
down
the
glass
our
eyes
darken
we
hear
no
steps
beside
us
we
see
no
lady
spread
her
ghostly
cloak
his
hands
shield
the
lantern
look
he
breathes
sound
asleep
love
upon
their
lips
stooping
holding
their
silver
lamp
above
us
long
they
look
and
deeply
long
they
pause
the
wind
drives
straightly
the
flame
stoops
slightly
wild
beams
of
moonlight
cross
both
floor
and
wall
and
meeting
stain
the
faces
bent
the
faces
pondering
the
faces
that
search
the
sleepers
and
seek
their
hidden
joy
safe
safe
safe
the
heart
of
the
house
beats
proudly
long
years
he
sighs
again
you
found
me
here
she
murmurs
sleeping
in
the
garden
reading
laughing
rolling
apples
in
the
loft
here
we
left
our
treasure
stooping
their
light
lifts
the
lids
upon
my
eyes
safe
safe
safe
the
pulse
of
the
house
beats
wildly
waking
i
cry
oh
is
this
buried
treasure
the
light
in
the
heart
a
society
this
is
how
it
all
came
about
six
or
seven
of
us
were
sitting
one
day
after
tea
some
were
gazing
across
the
street
into
the
windows
of
a
milliner
shop
where
the
light
still
shone
brightly
upon
scarlet
feathers
and
golden
slippers
others
were
idly
occupied
in
building
little
towers
of
sugar
upon
the
edge
of
the
tea
tray
after
a
time
so
far
as
i
can
remember
we
drew
round
the
fire
and
began
as
usual
to
praise
men
how
strong
how
noble
how
brilliant
how
courageous
how
beautiful
they
were
how
we
envied
those
who
by
hook
or
by
crook
managed
to
get
attached
to
one
for
life
when
poll
who
had
said
nothing
burst
into
tears
poll
i
must
tell
you
has
always
been
queer
for
one
thing
her
father
was
a
strange
man
he
left
her
a
fortune
in
his
will
but
on
condition
that
she
read
all
the
books
in
the
london
library
we
comforted
her
as
best
we
could
but
we
knew
in
our
hearts
how
vain
it
was
for
though
we
like
her
poll
is
no
beauty
leaves
her
shoe
laces
untied
and
must
have
been
thinking
while
we
praised
men
that
not
one
of
them
would
ever
wish
to
marry
her
at
last
she
dried
her
tears
for
some
time
we
could
make
nothing
of
what
she
said
strange
enough
it
was
in
all
conscience
she
told
us
that
as
we
knew
she
spent
most
of
her
time
in
the
london
library
reading
she
had
begun
she
said
with
english
literature
on
the
top
floor
and
was
steadily
working
her
way
down
to
the
on
the
bottom
and
now
half
or
perhaps
only
a
quarter
way
through
a
terrible
thing
had
happened
she
could
read
no
more
books
were
not
what
we
thought
them
books
she
cried
rising
to
her
feet
and
speaking
with
an
intensity
of
desolation
which
i
shall
never
forget
are
for
the
most
part
unutterably
bad
of
course
we
cried
out
that
shakespeare
wrote
books
and
milton
and
shelley
oh
yes
she
interrupted
us
you
been
well
taught
i
can
see
but
you
are
not
members
of
the
london
library
here
her
sobs
broke
forth
anew
at
length
recovering
a
little
she
opened
one
of
the
pile
of
books
which
she
always
carried
about
with
her
from
a
window
or
in
a
garden
or
some
such
name
as
that
it
was
called
and
it
was
written
by
a
man
called
benton
or
henson
or
something
of
that
kind
she
read
the
first
few
pages
we
listened
in
silence
but
that
not
a
book
someone
said
so
she
chose
another
this
time
it
was
a
history
but
i
have
forgotten
the
writer
name
our
trepidation
increased
as
she
went
on
not
a
word
of
it
seemed
to
be
true
and
the
style
in
which
it
was
written
was
execrable
poetry
poetry
we
cried
impatiently
read
us
poetry
i
can
not
describe
the
desolation
which
fell
upon
us
as
she
opened
a
little
volume
and
mouthed
out
the
verbose
sentimental
foolery
which
it
contained
it
must
have
been
written
by
a
woman
one
of
us
urged
but
no
she
told
us
that
it
was
written
by
a
young
man
one
of
the
most
famous
poets
of
the
day
i
leave
you
to
imagine
what
the
shock
of
the
discovery
was
though
we
all
cried
and
begged
her
to
read
no
more
she
persisted
and
read
us
extracts
from
the
lives
of
the
lord
chancellors
when
she
had
finished
jane
the
eldest
and
wisest
of
us
rose
to
her
feet
and
said
that
she
for
one
was
not
convinced
why
she
asked
if
men
write
such
rubbish
as
this
should
our
mothers
have
wasted
their
youth
in
bringing
them
into
the
world
we
were
all
silent
and
in
the
silence
poor
poll
could
be
heard
sobbing
out
why
why
did
my
father
teach
me
to
read
clorinda
was
the
first
to
come
to
her
senses
it
all
our
fault
she
said
every
one
of
us
knows
how
to
read
but
no
one
save
poll
has
ever
taken
the
trouble
to
do
it
i
for
one
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
it
was
a
woman
duty
to
spend
her
youth
in
bearing
children
i
venerated
my
mother
for
bearing
ten
still
more
my
grandmother
for
bearing
fifteen
it
was
i
confess
my
own
ambition
to
bear
twenty
we
have
gone
on
all
these
ages
supposing
that
men
were
equally
industrious
and
that
their
works
were
of
equal
merit
while
we
have
borne
the
children
they
we
supposed
have
borne
the
books
and
the
pictures
we
have
populated
the
world
they
have
civilized
it
but
now
that
we
can
read
what
prevents
us
from
judging
the
results
before
we
bring
another
child
into
the
world
we
must
swear
that
we
will
find
out
what
the
world
is
like
so
we
made
ourselves
into
a
society
for
asking
questions
one
of
us
was
to
visit
a
another
was
to
hide
herself
in
a
scholar
study
another
was
to
attend
a
meeting
of
business
men
while
all
were
to
read
books
look
at
pictures
go
to
concerts
keep
our
eyes
open
in
the
streets
and
ask
questions
perpetually
we
were
very
young
you
can
judge
of
our
simplicity
when
i
tell
you
that
before
parting
that
night
we
agreed
that
the
objects
of
life
were
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books
our
questions
were
to
be
directed
to
finding
out
how
far
these
objects
were
now
attained
by
men
we
vowed
solemnly
that
we
would
not
bear
a
single
child
until
we
were
satisfied
off
we
went
then
some
to
the
british
museum
others
to
the
king
navy
some
to
oxford
others
to
cambridge
we
visited
the
royal
academy
and
the
tate
heard
modern
music
in
concert
rooms
went
to
the
law
courts
and
saw
new
plays
no
one
dined
out
without
asking
her
partner
certain
questions
and
carefully
noting
his
replies
at
intervals
we
met
together
and
compared
our
observations
oh
those
were
merry
meetings
never
have
i
laughed
so
much
as
i
did
when
rose
read
her
notes
upon
honour
and
described
how
she
had
dressed
herself
as
an
æthiopian
prince
and
gone
aboard
one
of
his
majesty
ships
discovering
the
hoax
the
captain
visited
her
now
disguised
as
a
private
gentleman
and
demanded
that
honour
should
be
satisfied
but
how
she
asked
how
he
bellowed
with
the
cane
of
course
seeing
that
he
was
beside
himself
with
rage
and
expecting
that
her
last
moment
had
come
she
bent
over
and
received
to
her
amazement
six
light
taps
upon
the
behind
the
honour
of
the
british
navy
is
avenged
he
cried
and
raising
herself
she
saw
him
with
the
sweat
pouring
down
his
face
holding
out
a
trembling
right
hand
away
she
exclaimed
striking
an
attitude
and
imitating
the
ferocity
of
his
own
expression
my
honour
has
still
to
be
satisfied
spoken
like
a
gentleman
he
returned
and
fell
into
profound
thought
if
six
strokes
avenge
the
honour
of
the
king
navy
he
mused
how
many
avenge
the
honour
of
a
private
gentleman
he
said
he
would
prefer
to
lay
the
case
before
his
brother
officers
she
replied
haughtily
that
she
could
not
wait
he
praised
her
sensibility
let
me
see
he
cried
suddenly
did
your
father
keep
a
carriage
no
she
said
or
a
riding
horse
we
had
a
donkey
she
bethought
her
which
drew
the
mowing
machine
at
this
his
face
lighted
my
mother
name
she
added
for
god
sake
man
do
mention
your
mother
name
he
shrieked
trembling
like
an
aspen
and
flushing
to
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
it
was
ten
minutes
at
least
before
she
could
induce
him
to
proceed
at
length
he
decreed
that
if
she
gave
him
four
strokes
and
a
half
in
the
small
of
the
back
at
a
spot
indicated
by
himself
the
half
conceded
he
said
in
recognition
of
the
fact
that
her
great
grandmother
uncle
was
killed
at
trafalgar
it
was
his
opinion
that
her
honour
would
be
as
good
as
new
this
was
done
they
retired
to
a
restaurant
drank
two
bottles
of
wine
for
which
he
insisted
upon
paying
and
parted
with
protestations
of
eternal
friendship
then
we
had
fanny
account
of
her
visit
to
the
law
courts
at
her
first
visit
she
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
judges
were
either
made
of
wood
or
were
impersonated
by
large
animals
resembling
man
who
had
been
trained
to
move
with
extreme
dignity
mumble
and
nod
their
heads
to
test
her
theory
she
had
liberated
a
handkerchief
of
bluebottles
at
the
critical
moment
of
a
trial
but
was
unable
to
judge
whether
the
creatures
gave
signs
of
humanity
for
the
buzzing
of
the
flies
induced
so
sound
a
sleep
that
she
only
woke
in
time
to
see
the
prisoners
led
into
the
cells
below
but
from
the
evidence
she
brought
we
voted
that
it
is
unfair
to
suppose
that
the
judges
are
men
helen
went
to
the
royal
academy
but
when
asked
to
deliver
her
report
upon
the
pictures
she
began
to
recite
from
a
pale
blue
volume
o
for
the
touch
of
a
vanished
hand
and
the
sound
of
a
voice
that
is
still
home
is
the
hunter
home
from
the
hill
he
gave
his
bridle
reins
a
shake
love
is
sweet
love
is
brief
spring
the
fair
spring
is
the
year
pleasant
king
o
to
be
in
england
now
that
april
there
men
must
work
and
women
must
weep
the
path
of
duty
is
the
way
to
glory
we
could
listen
to
no
more
of
this
gibberish
we
want
no
more
poetry
we
cried
daughters
of
england
she
began
but
here
we
pulled
her
down
a
vase
of
water
getting
spilt
over
her
in
the
scuffle
thank
god
she
exclaimed
shaking
herself
like
a
dog
now
i
roll
on
the
carpet
and
see
if
i
ca
brush
off
what
remains
of
the
union
jack
then
perhaps
here
she
rolled
energetically
getting
up
she
began
to
explain
to
us
what
modern
pictures
are
like
when
castalia
stopped
her
what
is
the
average
size
of
a
picture
she
asked
perhaps
two
feet
by
two
and
a
half
she
said
castalia
made
notes
while
helen
spoke
and
when
she
had
done
and
we
were
trying
not
to
meet
each
other
eyes
rose
and
said
at
your
wish
i
spent
last
week
at
oxbridge
disguised
as
a
charwoman
i
thus
had
access
to
the
rooms
of
several
professors
and
will
now
attempt
to
give
you
some
idea
only
she
broke
off
i
think
how
to
do
it
it
all
so
queer
these
professors
she
went
on
live
in
large
houses
built
round
grass
plots
each
in
a
kind
of
cell
by
himself
yet
they
have
every
convenience
and
comfort
you
have
only
to
press
a
button
or
light
a
little
lamp
their
papers
are
beautifully
filed
books
abound
there
are
no
children
or
animals
save
half
a
dozen
stray
cats
and
one
aged
bullfinch
a
cock
i
remember
she
broke
off
an
aunt
of
mine
who
lived
at
dulwich
and
kept
cactuses
you
reached
the
conservatory
through
the
double
and
there
on
the
hot
pipes
were
dozens
of
them
ugly
squat
bristly
little
plants
each
in
a
separate
pot
once
in
a
hundred
years
the
aloe
flowered
so
my
aunt
said
but
she
died
before
that
happened
we
told
her
to
keep
to
the
point
well
she
resumed
when
professor
hobkin
was
out
i
examined
his
life
work
an
edition
of
sappho
it
a
queer
looking
book
six
or
seven
inches
thick
not
all
by
sappho
oh
no
most
of
it
is
a
defence
of
sappho
chastity
which
some
german
had
denied
and
i
can
assure
you
the
passion
with
which
these
two
gentlemen
argued
the
learning
they
displayed
the
prodigious
ingenuity
with
which
they
disputed
the
use
of
some
implement
which
looked
to
me
for
all
the
world
like
a
hairpin
astounded
me
especially
when
the
door
opened
and
professor
hobkin
himself
appeared
a
very
nice
mild
old
gentleman
but
what
could
know
about
chastity
we
misunderstood
her
no
no
she
protested
he
the
soul
of
honour
i
sure
not
that
he
resembles
rose
sea
captain
in
the
least
i
was
thinking
rather
of
my
aunt
cactuses
what
could
know
about
chastity
again
we
told
her
not
to
wander
from
the
point
did
the
oxbridge
professors
help
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books
the
objects
of
life
there
she
exclaimed
it
never
struck
me
to
ask
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
they
could
possibly
produce
anything
i
believe
said
sue
that
you
made
some
mistake
probably
professor
hobkin
was
a
gynæcologist
a
scholar
is
a
very
different
sort
of
man
a
scholar
is
overflowing
with
humour
and
invention
perhaps
addicted
to
wine
but
what
of
that
a
delightful
companion
generous
subtle
imaginative
as
stands
to
reason
for
he
spends
his
life
in
company
with
the
finest
human
beings
that
have
ever
existed
hum
said
castalia
perhaps
i
better
go
back
and
try
again
some
three
months
later
it
happened
that
i
was
sitting
alone
when
castalia
entered
i
do
know
what
it
was
in
the
look
of
her
that
so
moved
me
but
i
could
not
restrain
myself
and
dashing
across
the
room
i
clasped
her
in
my
arms
not
only
was
she
very
beautiful
she
seemed
also
in
the
highest
spirits
how
happy
you
look
i
exclaimed
as
she
sat
down
i
been
at
oxbridge
she
said
asking
questions
answering
them
she
replied
you
have
not
broken
our
vow
i
said
anxiously
noticing
something
about
her
figure
oh
the
vow
she
said
casually
i
going
to
have
a
baby
if
what
you
mean
you
ca
imagine
she
burst
out
how
exciting
how
beautiful
how
satisfying
what
is
i
asked
to
to
answer
questions
she
replied
in
some
confusion
whereupon
she
told
me
the
whole
of
her
story
but
in
the
middle
of
an
account
which
interested
and
excited
me
more
than
anything
i
had
ever
heard
she
gave
the
strangest
cry
half
whoop
half
holloa
chastity
chastity
where
my
chastity
she
cried
help
ho
the
scent
bottle
there
was
nothing
in
the
room
but
a
cruet
containing
mustard
which
i
was
about
to
administer
when
she
recovered
her
composure
you
should
have
thought
of
that
three
months
ago
i
said
severely
true
she
replied
there
not
much
good
in
thinking
of
it
now
it
was
unfortunate
by
the
way
that
my
mother
had
me
called
castalia
oh
castalia
your
mother
i
was
beginning
when
she
reached
for
the
mustard
pot
no
no
no
she
said
shaking
her
head
if
you
been
a
chaste
woman
yourself
you
would
have
screamed
at
the
sight
of
me
instead
of
which
you
rushed
across
the
room
and
took
me
in
your
arms
no
cassandra
we
are
neither
of
us
chaste
so
we
went
on
talking
meanwhile
the
room
was
filling
up
for
it
was
the
day
appointed
to
discuss
the
results
of
our
observations
everyone
i
thought
felt
as
i
did
about
castalia
they
kissed
her
and
said
how
glad
they
were
to
see
her
again
at
length
when
we
were
all
assembled
jane
rose
and
said
that
it
was
time
to
begin
she
began
by
saying
that
we
had
now
asked
questions
for
over
five
years
and
that
though
the
results
were
bound
to
be
inconclusive
here
castalia
nudged
me
and
whispered
that
she
was
not
so
sure
about
that
then
she
got
up
and
interrupting
jane
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
said
before
you
say
any
more
i
want
to
know
am
i
to
stay
in
the
room
because
she
added
i
have
to
confess
that
i
am
an
impure
woman
everyone
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
you
are
going
to
have
a
baby
asked
jane
she
nodded
her
head
it
was
extraordinary
to
see
the
different
expressions
on
their
faces
a
sort
of
hum
went
through
the
room
in
which
i
could
catch
the
words
impure
baby
castalia
and
so
on
jane
who
was
herself
considerably
moved
put
it
to
us
shall
she
go
is
she
impure
such
a
roar
filled
the
room
as
might
have
been
heard
in
the
street
outside
no
no
no
let
her
stay
impure
fiddlesticks
yet
i
fancied
that
some
of
the
youngest
girls
of
nineteen
or
twenty
held
back
as
if
overcome
with
shyness
then
we
all
came
about
her
and
began
asking
questions
and
at
last
i
saw
one
of
the
youngest
who
had
kept
in
the
background
approach
shyly
and
say
to
her
what
is
chastity
then
i
mean
is
it
good
or
is
it
bad
or
is
it
nothing
at
all
she
replied
so
low
that
i
could
not
catch
what
she
said
you
know
i
was
shocked
said
another
for
at
least
ten
minutes
in
my
opinion
said
poll
who
was
growing
crusty
from
always
reading
in
the
london
library
chastity
is
nothing
but
ignorance
a
most
discreditable
state
of
mind
we
should
admit
only
the
unchaste
to
our
society
i
vote
that
castalia
shall
be
our
president
this
was
violently
disputed
it
is
as
unfair
to
brand
women
with
chastity
as
with
unchastity
said
poll
some
of
us
have
the
opportunity
either
moreover
i
believe
cassy
herself
maintains
that
she
acted
as
she
did
from
a
pure
love
of
knowledge
he
is
only
and
divinely
beautiful
said
cassy
with
a
ravishing
gesture
i
move
said
helen
that
no
one
be
allowed
to
talk
of
chastity
or
unchastity
save
those
who
are
in
love
oh
bother
said
judith
who
had
been
enquiring
into
scientific
matters
i
not
in
love
and
i
longing
to
explain
my
measures
for
dispensing
with
prostitutes
and
fertilizing
virgins
by
act
of
parliament
she
went
on
to
tell
us
of
an
invention
of
hers
to
be
erected
at
tube
stations
and
other
public
resorts
which
upon
payment
of
a
small
fee
would
safeguard
the
nation
health
accommodate
its
sons
and
relieve
its
daughters
then
she
had
contrived
a
method
of
preserving
in
sealed
tubes
the
germs
of
future
lord
chancellors
or
poets
or
painters
or
musicians
she
went
on
supposing
that
is
to
say
that
these
breeds
are
not
extinct
and
that
women
still
wish
to
bear
children
of
course
we
wish
to
bear
children
cried
castalia
impatiently
jane
rapped
the
table
that
is
the
very
point
we
are
met
to
consider
she
said
for
five
years
we
have
been
trying
to
find
out
whether
we
are
justified
in
continuing
the
human
race
castalia
has
anticipated
our
decision
but
it
remains
for
the
rest
of
us
to
make
up
our
minds
here
one
after
another
of
our
messengers
rose
and
delivered
their
reports
the
marvels
of
civilisation
far
exceeded
our
expectations
and
as
we
learnt
for
the
first
time
how
man
flies
in
the
air
talks
across
space
penetrates
to
the
heart
of
an
atom
and
embraces
the
universe
in
his
speculations
a
murmur
of
admiration
burst
from
our
lips
we
are
proud
we
cried
that
our
mothers
sacrificed
their
youth
in
such
a
cause
as
this
castalia
who
had
been
listening
intently
looked
prouder
than
all
the
rest
then
jane
reminded
us
that
we
had
still
much
to
learn
and
castalia
begged
us
to
make
haste
on
we
went
through
a
vast
tangle
of
statistics
we
learnt
that
england
has
a
population
of
so
many
millions
and
that
such
and
such
a
proportion
of
them
is
constantly
hungry
and
in
prison
that
the
average
size
of
a
working
man
family
is
such
and
that
so
great
a
percentage
of
women
die
from
maladies
incident
to
childbirth
reports
were
read
of
visits
to
factories
shops
slums
and
dockyards
descriptions
were
given
of
the
stock
exchange
of
a
gigantic
house
of
business
in
the
city
and
of
a
government
office
the
british
colonies
were
now
discussed
and
some
account
was
given
of
our
rule
in
india
africa
and
ireland
i
was
sitting
by
castalia
and
i
noticed
her
uneasiness
we
shall
never
come
to
any
conclusion
at
all
at
this
rate
she
said
as
it
appears
that
civilisation
is
so
much
more
complex
than
we
had
any
notion
would
it
not
be
better
to
confine
ourselves
to
our
original
enquiry
we
agreed
that
it
was
the
object
of
life
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books
all
this
time
we
have
been
talking
of
aeroplanes
factories
and
money
let
us
talk
about
men
themselves
and
their
arts
for
that
is
the
heart
of
the
matter
so
the
diners
out
stepped
forward
with
long
slips
of
paper
containing
answers
to
their
questions
these
had
been
framed
after
much
consideration
a
good
man
we
had
agreed
must
at
any
rate
be
honest
passionate
and
unworldly
but
whether
or
not
a
particular
man
possessed
those
qualities
could
only
be
discovered
by
asking
questions
often
beginning
at
a
remote
distance
from
the
centre
is
kensington
a
nice
place
to
live
in
where
is
your
son
being
educated
and
your
daughter
now
please
tell
me
what
do
you
pay
for
your
cigars
by
the
way
is
sir
joseph
a
baronet
or
only
a
knight
often
it
seemed
that
we
learnt
more
from
trivial
questions
of
this
kind
than
from
more
direct
ones
i
accepted
my
peerage
said
lord
bunkum
because
my
wife
wished
it
i
forget
how
many
titles
were
accepted
for
the
same
reason
working
fifteen
hours
out
of
the
as
i
do
ten
thousand
professional
men
began
no
no
of
course
you
can
neither
read
nor
write
but
why
do
you
work
so
hard
my
dear
lady
with
a
growing
family
but
does
your
family
grow
their
wives
wished
that
too
or
perhaps
it
was
the
british
empire
but
more
significant
than
the
answers
were
the
refusals
to
answer
very
few
would
reply
at
all
to
questions
about
morality
and
religion
and
such
answers
as
were
given
were
not
serious
questions
as
to
the
value
of
money
and
power
were
almost
invariably
brushed
aside
or
pressed
at
extreme
risk
to
the
asker
i
sure
said
jill
that
if
sir
harley
tightboots
had
been
carving
the
mutton
when
i
asked
him
about
the
capitalist
system
he
would
have
cut
my
throat
the
only
reason
why
we
escaped
with
our
lives
over
and
over
again
is
that
men
are
at
once
so
hungry
and
so
chivalrous
they
despise
us
too
much
to
mind
what
we
say
of
course
they
despise
us
said
eleanor
at
the
same
time
how
do
you
account
for
this
i
made
enquiries
among
the
artists
now
no
woman
has
ever
been
an
artist
has
she
poll
cried
poll
like
a
man
crying
muffins
in
a
back
street
damn
the
woman
someone
exclaimed
what
a
bore
she
is
since
sappho
there
has
been
no
female
of
first
rate
eleanor
began
quoting
from
a
weekly
newspaper
it
now
well
known
that
sappho
was
the
somewhat
lewd
invention
of
professor
hobkin
ruth
interrupted
anyhow
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
any
woman
ever
has
been
able
to
write
or
ever
will
be
able
to
write
eleanor
continued
and
yet
whenever
i
go
among
authors
they
never
cease
to
talk
to
me
about
their
books
masterly
i
say
or
shakespeare
himself
for
one
must
say
something
and
i
assure
you
they
believe
me
that
proves
nothing
said
jane
they
all
do
it
only
she
sighed
it
does
seem
to
help
much
perhaps
we
had
better
examine
modern
literature
next
liz
it
your
turn
elizabeth
rose
and
said
that
in
order
to
prosecute
her
enquiry
she
had
dressed
as
a
man
and
been
taken
for
a
reviewer
i
have
read
new
books
pretty
steadily
for
the
past
five
years
said
she
wells
is
the
most
popular
living
writer
then
comes
arnold
bennett
then
compton
mackenzie
mckenna
and
walpole
may
be
bracketed
together
she
sat
down
but
you
told
us
nothing
we
expostulated
or
do
you
mean
that
these
gentlemen
have
greatly
surpassed
and
that
english
fiction
is
where
that
review
of
yours
oh
yes
in
their
hands
safe
quite
safe
she
said
shifting
uneasily
from
foot
to
foot
and
i
sure
that
they
give
away
even
more
than
they
receive
we
were
all
sure
of
that
but
we
pressed
her
do
they
write
good
books
good
books
she
said
looking
at
the
ceiling
you
must
remember
she
began
speaking
with
extreme
rapidity
that
fiction
is
the
mirror
of
life
and
you
ca
deny
that
education
is
of
the
highest
importance
and
that
it
would
be
extremely
annoying
if
you
found
yourself
alone
at
brighton
late
at
night
not
to
know
which
was
the
best
boarding
house
to
stay
at
and
suppose
it
was
a
dripping
sunday
evening
would
it
be
nice
to
go
to
the
movies
but
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
we
asked
nothing
nothing
nothing
whatever
she
replied
well
tell
us
the
truth
we
bade
her
the
truth
but
is
it
wonderful
she
broke
off
chitter
has
written
a
weekly
article
for
the
past
thirty
years
upon
love
or
hot
buttered
toast
and
has
sent
all
his
sons
to
eton
the
truth
we
demanded
oh
the
truth
she
stammered
the
truth
has
nothing
to
do
with
literature
and
sitting
down
she
refused
to
say
another
word
it
all
seemed
to
us
very
inconclusive
ladies
we
must
try
to
sum
up
the
results
jane
was
beginning
when
a
hum
which
had
been
heard
for
some
time
through
the
open
window
drowned
her
voice
war
war
war
declaration
of
war
men
were
shouting
in
the
street
below
we
looked
at
each
other
in
horror
what
war
we
cried
what
war
we
remembered
too
late
that
we
had
never
thought
of
sending
anyone
to
the
house
of
commons
we
had
forgotten
all
about
it
we
turned
to
poll
who
had
reached
the
history
shelves
in
the
london
library
and
asked
her
to
enlighten
us
why
we
cried
do
men
go
to
war
sometimes
for
one
reason
sometimes
for
another
she
replied
calmly
in
for
example
the
shouts
outside
drowned
her
words
again
in
in
it
was
the
austrians
in
was
the
in
on
the
other
hand
but
it
now
we
cut
her
short
ah
i
do
know
what
they
going
to
war
for
now
she
admitted
the
war
was
over
and
peace
was
in
process
of
being
signed
when
i
once
more
found
myself
with
castalia
in
the
room
where
our
meetings
used
to
be
held
we
began
idly
turning
over
the
pages
of
our
old
minute
books
queer
i
mused
to
see
what
we
were
thinking
five
years
ago
we
are
agreed
castalia
quoted
reading
over
my
shoulder
that
it
is
the
object
of
life
to
produce
good
people
and
good
books
we
made
no
comment
upon
a
good
man
is
at
any
rate
honest
passionate
and
unworldly
what
a
woman
language
i
observed
oh
dear
cried
castalia
pushing
the
book
away
from
her
what
fools
we
were
it
was
all
poll
father
fault
she
went
on
i
believe
he
did
it
on
purpose
that
ridiculous
will
i
mean
forcing
poll
to
read
all
the
books
in
the
london
library
if
we
had
learnt
to
read
she
said
bitterly
we
might
still
have
been
bearing
children
in
ignorance
and
that
i
believe
was
the
happiest
life
after
all
i
know
what
you
going
to
say
about
war
she
checked
me
and
the
horror
of
bearing
children
to
see
them
killed
but
our
mothers
did
it
and
their
mothers
and
their
mothers
before
them
and
did
complain
they
could
read
i
done
my
best
she
sighed
to
prevent
my
little
girl
from
learning
to
read
but
what
the
use
i
caught
ann
only
yesterday
with
a
newspaper
in
her
hand
and
she
was
beginning
to
ask
me
if
it
was
next
she
ask
me
whether
lloyd
george
is
a
good
man
then
whether
arnold
bennett
is
a
good
novelist
and
finally
whether
i
believe
in
god
how
can
i
bring
my
daughter
up
to
believe
in
nothing
she
demanded
surely
you
could
teach
her
to
believe
that
a
man
intellect
is
and
always
will
be
fundamentally
superior
to
a
woman
i
suggested
she
brightened
at
this
and
began
to
turn
over
our
old
minutes
again
yes
she
said
think
of
their
discoveries
their
mathematics
their
science
their
philosophy
their
scholarship
and
then
she
began
to
laugh
i
shall
never
forget
old
hobkin
and
the
hairpin
she
said
and
went
on
reading
and
laughing
and
i
thought
she
was
quite
happy
when
suddenly
she
drew
the
book
from
her
and
burst
out
oh
cassandra
why
do
you
torment
me
do
you
know
that
our
belief
in
man
intellect
is
the
greatest
fallacy
of
them
all
what
i
exclaimed
ask
any
journalist
schoolmaster
politician
or
public
house
keeper
in
the
land
and
they
will
all
tell
you
that
men
are
much
cleverer
than
women
as
if
i
doubted
it
she
said
scornfully
how
could
they
help
it
have
we
bred
them
and
fed
and
kept
them
in
comfort
since
the
beginning
of
time
so
that
they
may
be
clever
even
if
they
nothing
else
it
all
our
doing
she
cried
we
insisted
upon
having
intellect
and
now
we
got
it
and
it
intellect
she
continued
that
at
the
bottom
of
it
what
could
be
more
charming
than
a
boy
before
he
has
begun
to
cultivate
his
intellect
he
is
beautiful
to
look
at
he
gives
himself
no
airs
he
understands
the
meaning
of
art
and
literature
instinctively
he
goes
about
enjoying
his
life
and
making
other
people
enjoy
theirs
then
they
teach
him
to
cultivate
his
intellect
he
becomes
a
barrister
a
civil
servant
a
general
an
author
a
professor
every
day
he
goes
to
an
office
every
year
he
produces
a
book
he
maintains
a
whole
family
by
the
products
of
his
brain
poor
devil
soon
he
can
not
come
into
a
room
without
making
us
all
feel
uncomfortable
he
condescends
to
every
woman
he
meets
and
dares
not
tell
the
truth
even
to
his
own
wife
instead
of
rejoicing
our
eyes
we
have
to
shut
them
if
we
are
to
take
him
in
our
arms
true
they
console
themselves
with
stars
of
all
shapes
ribbons
of
all
shades
and
incomes
of
all
sizes
but
what
is
to
console
us
that
we
shall
be
able
in
ten
years
time
to
spend
a
at
lahore
or
that
the
least
insect
in
japan
has
a
name
twice
the
length
of
its
body
oh
cassandra
for
heaven
sake
let
us
devise
a
method
by
which
men
may
bear
children
it
is
our
only
chance
for
unless
we
provide
them
with
some
innocent
occupation
we
shall
get
neither
good
people
nor
good
books
we
shall
perish
beneath
the
fruits
of
their
unbridled
activity
and
not
a
human
being
will
survive
to
know
that
there
once
was
shakespeare
it
is
too
late
i
replied
we
can
not
provide
even
for
the
children
that
we
have
and
then
you
ask
me
to
believe
in
intellect
she
said
while
we
spoke
men
were
crying
hoarsely
and
wearily
in
the
street
and
listening
we
heard
that
the
treaty
of
peace
had
just
been
signed
the
voices
died
away
the
rain
was
falling
and
interfered
no
doubt
with
the
proper
explosion
of
the
fireworks
my
cook
will
have
bought
the
evening
news
said
castalia
and
ann
will
be
spelling
it
out
over
her
tea
i
must
go
home
it
no
good
not
a
bit
of
good
i
said
once
she
knows
how
to
read
there
only
one
thing
you
can
teach
her
to
believe
in
and
that
is
herself
well
that
would
be
a
change
sighed
castalia
so
we
swept
up
the
papers
of
our
society
and
though
ann
was
playing
with
her
doll
very
happily
we
solemnly
made
her
a
present
of
the
lot
and
told
her
we
had
chosen
her
to
be
president
of
the
society
of
the
future
upon
which
she
burst
into
tears
poor
little
girl

or

and

remains

the

of

a

oh

an
unwritten
novel
such
an
expression
of
unhappiness
was
enough
by
itself
to
make
eyes
slide
above
the
paper
edge
to
the
poor
face
insignificant
without
that
look
almost
a
symbol
of
human
destiny
with
it
life
what
you
see
in
people
eyes
life
what
they
learn
and
having
learnt
it
never
though
they
seek
to
hide
it
cease
to
be
aware
of
what
that
life
like
that
it
seems
five
faces
opposite
five
mature
faces
and
the
knowledge
in
each
face
strange
though
how
people
want
to
conceal
it
marks
of
reticence
are
on
all
those
faces
lips
shut
eyes
shaded
each
one
of
the
five
doing
something
to
hide
or
stultify
his
knowledge
one
smokes
another
reads
a
third
checks
entries
in
a
pocket
book
a
fourth
stares
at
the
map
of
the
line
framed
opposite
and
the
fifth
the
terrible
thing
about
the
fifth
is
that
she
does
nothing
at
all
she
looks
at
life
ah
but
my
poor
unfortunate
woman
do
play
the
game
do
for
all
our
sakes
conceal
it
as
if
she
heard
me
she
looked
up
shifted
slightly
in
her
seat
and
sighed
she
seemed
to
apologise
and
at
the
same
time
to
say
to
me
if
only
you
knew
then
she
looked
at
life
again
but
i
do
know
i
answered
silently
glancing
at
the
for
manners
sake
i
know
the
whole
business
between
germany
and
the
allied
powers
was
yesterday
officially
ushered
in
at
paris
signor
nitti
the
italian
prime
minister
a
passenger
train
at
doncaster
was
in
collision
with
a
goods
train
we
all
know
the
knows
but
we
pretend
we
do
my
eyes
had
once
more
crept
over
the
paper
rim
she
shuddered
twitched
her
arm
queerly
to
the
middle
of
her
back
and
shook
her
head
again
i
dipped
into
my
great
reservoir
of
life
take
what
you
like
i
continued
births
deaths
marriages
court
circular
the
habits
of
birds
leonardo
da
vinci
the
sandhills
murder
high
wages
and
the
cost
of
living
oh
take
what
you
like
i
repeated
it
all
in
the
again
with
infinite
weariness
she
moved
her
head
from
side
to
side
until
like
a
top
exhausted
with
spinning
it
settled
on
her
neck
the
was
no
protection
against
such
sorrow
as
hers
but
other
human
beings
forbade
intercourse
the
best
thing
to
do
against
life
was
to
fold
the
paper
so
that
it
made
a
perfect
square
crisp
thick
impervious
even
to
life
this
done
i
glanced
up
quickly
armed
with
a
shield
of
my
own
she
pierced
through
my
shield
she
gazed
into
my
eyes
as
if
searching
any
sediment
of
courage
at
the
depths
of
them
and
damping
it
to
clay
her
twitch
alone
denied
all
hope
discounted
all
illusion
so
we
rattled
through
surrey
and
across
the
border
into
sussex
but
with
my
eyes
upon
life
i
did
not
see
that
the
other
travellers
had
left
one
by
one
till
save
for
the
man
who
read
we
were
alone
together
here
was
three
bridges
station
we
drew
slowly
down
the
platform
and
stopped
was
he
going
to
leave
us
i
prayed
both
ways
i
prayed
last
that
he
might
stay
at
that
instant
he
roused
himself
crumpled
his
paper
contemptuously
like
a
thing
done
with
burst
open
the
door
and
left
us
alone
the
unhappy
woman
leaning
a
little
forward
palely
and
colourlessly
addressed
me
talked
of
stations
and
holidays
of
brothers
at
eastbourne
and
the
time
of
year
which
was
i
forget
now
early
or
late
but
at
last
looking
from
the
window
and
seeing
i
knew
only
life
she
breathed
staying
away
that
the
drawback
of
it
ah
now
we
approached
the
catastrophe
my
the
bitterness
of
her
tone
was
like
lemon
on
cold
steel
and
speaking
not
to
me
but
to
herself
she
muttered
nonsense
she
would
say
that
what
they
all
say
and
while
she
spoke
she
fidgeted
as
though
the
skin
on
her
back
were
as
a
plucked
fowl
in
a
poulterer
oh
that
cow
she
broke
off
nervously
as
though
the
great
wooden
cow
in
the
meadow
had
shocked
her
and
saved
her
from
some
indiscretion
then
she
shuddered
and
then
she
made
the
awkward
angular
movement
that
i
had
seen
before
as
if
after
the
spasm
some
spot
between
the
shoulders
burnt
or
itched
then
again
she
looked
the
most
unhappy
woman
in
the
world
and
i
once
more
reproached
her
though
not
with
the
same
conviction
for
if
there
were
a
reason
and
if
i
knew
the
reason
the
stigma
was
removed
from
life
i
said
her
lips
pursed
as
if
to
spit
venom
at
the
word
pursed
they
remained
all
she
did
was
to
take
her
glove
and
rub
hard
at
a
spot
on
the
she
rubbed
as
if
she
would
rub
something
out
for
ever
some
stain
some
indelible
contamination
indeed
the
spot
remained
for
all
her
rubbing
and
back
she
sank
with
the
shudder
and
the
clutch
of
the
arm
i
had
come
to
expect
something
impelled
me
to
take
my
glove
and
rub
my
window
there
too
was
a
little
speck
on
the
glass
for
all
my
rubbing
it
remained
and
then
the
spasm
went
through
me
i
crooked
my
arm
and
plucked
at
the
middle
of
my
back
my
skin
too
felt
like
the
damp
chicken
skin
in
the
poulterer
one
spot
between
the
shoulders
itched
and
irritated
felt
clammy
felt
raw
could
i
reach
it
surreptitiously
i
tried
she
saw
me
a
smile
of
infinite
irony
infinite
sorrow
flitted
and
faded
from
her
face
but
she
had
communicated
shared
her
secret
passed
her
poison
she
would
speak
no
more
leaning
back
in
my
corner
shielding
my
eyes
from
her
eyes
seeing
only
the
slopes
and
hollows
greys
and
purples
of
the
winter
landscape
i
read
her
message
deciphered
her
secret
reading
it
beneath
her
gaze
hilda
the
hilda
hilda
hilda
marsh
hilda
the
blooming
the
full
bosomed
the
matronly
hilda
stands
at
the
door
as
the
cab
draws
up
holding
a
coin
poor
minnie
more
of
a
grasshopper
than
ever
old
cloak
she
had
last
year
well
well
with
two
children
these
days
one
ca
do
more
no
minnie
i
got
it
here
you
are
cabby
none
of
your
ways
with
me
come
in
minnie
oh
i
could
carry
let
alone
your
basket
so
they
go
into
the
aunt
minnie
children
slowly
the
knives
and
forks
sink
from
the
upright
down
they
get
bob
and
barbara
hold
out
hands
stiffly
back
again
to
their
chairs
staring
between
the
resumed
mouthfuls
but
this
we
skip
ornaments
curtains
trefoil
china
plate
yellow
oblongs
of
cheese
white
squares
of
biscuit
skip
oh
but
wait
halfway
through
luncheon
one
of
those
shivers
bob
stares
at
her
spoon
in
mouth
get
on
with
your
pudding
bob
but
hilda
disapproves
why
she
twitch
skip
skip
till
we
reach
the
landing
on
the
upper
floor
stairs
linoleum
worn
oh
yes
little
bedroom
looking
out
over
the
roofs
of
eastbourne
zigzagging
roofs
like
the
spines
of
caterpillars
this
way
that
way
striped
red
and
yellow
with
slating
now
minnie
the
door
shut
hilda
heavily
descends
to
the
basement
you
unstrap
the
straps
of
your
basket
lay
on
the
bed
a
meagre
nightgown
stand
side
by
side
furred
felt
slippers
the
no
you
avoid
the
some
methodical
disposition
of
perhaps
the
shell
box
has
something
in
it
you
shake
it
it
the
pearl
stud
there
was
last
year
that
all
and
then
the
sniff
the
sigh
the
sitting
by
the
window
three
on
a
december
afternoon
the
rain
drizzling
one
light
low
in
the
skylight
of
a
drapery
emporium
another
high
in
a
servant
bedroom
this
one
goes
out
that
gives
her
nothing
to
look
at
a
moment
blankness
then
what
are
you
thinking
let
me
peep
across
at
her
opposite
she
asleep
or
pretending
it
so
what
would
she
think
about
sitting
at
the
window
at
three
in
the
afternoon
health
money
hills
her
god
yes
sitting
on
the
very
edge
of
the
chair
looking
over
the
roofs
of
eastbourne
minnie
marsh
prays
to
god
all
very
well
and
she
may
rub
the
pane
too
as
though
to
see
god
better
but
what
god
does
she
see
who
the
god
of
minnie
marsh
the
god
of
the
back
streets
of
eastbourne
the
god
of
three
in
the
afternoon
i
too
see
roofs
i
see
sky
but
oh
dear
this
seeing
of
gods
more
like
president
kruger
than
prince
albert
that
the
best
i
can
do
for
him
and
i
see
him
on
a
chair
in
a
black
not
so
very
high
up
either
i
can
manage
a
cloud
or
two
for
him
to
sit
on
and
then
his
hand
trailing
in
the
cloud
holds
a
rod
a
truncheon
is
it
black
thick
thorned
a
brutal
old
bully
minnie
god
did
he
send
the
itch
and
the
patch
and
the
twitch
is
that
why
she
prays
what
she
rubs
on
the
window
is
the
stain
of
sin
oh
she
committed
some
crime
i
have
my
choice
of
crimes
the
woods
flit
and
fly
in
summer
there
are
bluebells
in
the
opening
there
when
spring
comes
primroses
a
parting
was
it
twenty
years
ago
vows
broken
not
minnie
she
was
faithful
how
she
nursed
her
mother
all
her
savings
on
the
tombstone
wreaths
under
glass
daffodils
in
jars
but
i
off
the
track
a
crime
they
would
say
she
kept
her
sorrow
suppressed
her
secret
her
sex
they
say
the
scientific
people
but
what
flummery
to
saddle
with
sex
no
more
like
this
passing
down
the
streets
of
croydon
twenty
years
ago
the
violet
loops
of
ribbon
in
the
window
spangled
in
the
electric
light
catch
her
eye
she
lingers
past
six
still
by
running
she
can
reach
home
she
pushes
through
the
glass
swing
door
it
shallow
trays
brim
with
ribbons
she
pauses
pulls
this
fingers
that
with
the
raised
roses
on
it
no
need
to
choose
no
need
to
buy
and
each
tray
with
its
surprises
we
do
shut
till
seven
and
then
it
seven
she
runs
she
rushes
home
she
reaches
but
too
late
neighbours
the
doctor
baby
brother
the
kettle
scalded
hospital
dead
or
only
the
shock
of
it
the
blame
ah
but
the
detail
matters
nothing
it
what
she
carries
with
her
the
spot
the
crime
the
thing
to
expiate
always
there
between
her
shoulders
yes
she
seems
to
nod
to
me
it
the
thing
i
did
whether
you
did
or
what
you
did
i
do
mind
it
not
the
thing
i
want
the
draper
window
looped
with
violet
that
do
a
little
cheap
perhaps
a
little
commonplace
since
one
has
a
choice
of
crimes
but
then
so
many
let
me
peep
across
again
still
sleeping
or
pretending
sleep
white
worn
the
mouth
closed
a
touch
of
obstinacy
more
than
one
would
think
no
hint
of
sex
so
many
crimes
are
crime
your
crime
was
cheap
only
the
retribution
solemn
for
now
the
church
door
opens
the
hard
wooden
pew
receives
her
on
the
brown
tiles
she
kneels
every
day
winter
summer
dusk
dawn
here
she
at
it
prays
all
her
sins
fall
fall
for
ever
fall
the
spot
receives
them
raised
it
red
it
burning
next
she
twitches
small
boys
point
bob
at
lunch
but
elderly
women
are
the
worst
indeed
now
you
ca
sit
praying
any
longer
kruger
sunk
beneath
the
clouds
washed
over
as
with
a
painter
brush
of
liquid
grey
to
which
he
adds
a
tinge
of
black
even
the
tip
of
the
truncheon
gone
now
what
always
happens
just
as
you
seen
him
felt
him
someone
interrupts
it
hilda
now
how
you
hate
her
she
even
lock
the
bathroom
door
overnight
too
though
it
only
cold
water
you
want
and
sometimes
when
the
been
bad
it
seems
as
if
washing
helped
and
john
at
breakfast
the
children
meals
are
worst
and
sometimes
there
are
friends
ferns
altogether
hide
they
guess
too
so
out
you
go
along
the
front
where
the
waves
are
grey
and
the
papers
blow
and
the
glass
shelters
green
and
draughty
and
the
chairs
cost
tuppence
too
much
for
there
must
be
preachers
along
the
sands
ah
that
a
nigger
that
a
funny
man
that
a
man
with
parakeets
poor
little
creatures
is
there
no
one
here
who
thinks
of
god
just
up
there
over
the
pier
with
his
rod
but
no
there
nothing
but
grey
in
the
sky
or
if
it
blue
the
white
clouds
hide
him
and
the
music
it
military
music
and
what
they
are
fishing
for
do
they
catch
them
how
the
children
stare
well
then
home
a
back
way
home
a
back
way
the
words
have
meaning
might
have
been
spoken
by
the
old
man
with
whiskers
no
no
he
did
really
speak
but
everything
has
meaning
placards
leaning
against
doorways
names
above
red
fruit
in
baskets
women
heads
in
the
hairdresser
all
say
minnie
marsh
but
here
a
jerk
eggs
are
cheaper
that
what
always
happens
i
was
heading
her
over
the
waterfall
straight
for
madness
when
like
a
flock
of
dream
sheep
she
turns
way
and
runs
between
my
fingers
eggs
are
cheaper
tethered
to
the
shores
of
the
world
none
of
the
crimes
sorrows
rhapsodies
or
insanities
for
poor
minnie
marsh
never
late
for
luncheon
never
caught
in
a
storm
without
a
mackintosh
never
utterly
unconscious
of
the
cheapness
of
eggs
so
she
reaches
home
scrapes
her
boots
have
i
read
you
right
but
the
human
face
the
human
face
at
the
top
of
the
fullest
sheet
of
print
holds
more
withholds
more
now
eyes
open
she
looks
out
and
in
the
human
eye
how
define
it
there
a
break
a
division
so
that
when
you
grasped
the
stem
the
off
the
moth
that
hangs
in
the
evening
over
the
yellow
flower
move
raise
your
hand
off
high
away
i
wo
raise
my
hand
hang
still
then
quiver
life
soul
spirit
whatever
you
are
of
minnie
marsh
i
too
on
my
flower
the
hawk
over
the
down
alone
or
what
were
the
worth
of
life
to
rise
hang
still
in
the
evening
in
the
midday
hang
still
over
the
down
the
flicker
of
a
hand
off
up
then
poised
again
alone
unseen
seeing
all
so
still
down
there
all
so
lovely
none
seeing
none
caring
the
eyes
of
others
our
prisons
their
thoughts
our
cages
air
above
air
below
and
the
moon
and
immortality
oh
but
i
drop
to
the
turf
are
you
down
too
you
in
the
corner
what
your
name
woman
minnie
marsh
some
such
name
as
that
there
she
is
tight
to
her
blossom
opening
her
from
which
she
takes
a
hollow
shell
an
egg
who
was
saying
that
eggs
were
cheaper
you
or
i
oh
it
was
you
who
said
it
on
the
way
home
you
remember
when
the
old
gentleman
suddenly
opening
his
umbrella
or
sneezing
was
it
anyhow
kruger
went
and
you
came
home
a
back
way
and
scraped
your
boots
yes
and
now
you
lay
across
your
knees
a
into
which
drop
little
angular
fragments
of
eggshell
fragments
of
a
map
a
puzzle
i
wish
i
could
piece
them
together
if
you
would
only
sit
still
moved
her
knees
the
map
in
bits
again
down
the
slopes
of
the
andes
the
white
blocks
of
marble
go
bounding
and
hurtling
crushing
to
death
a
whole
troop
of
spanish
muleteers
with
their
convoy
drake
booty
gold
and
silver
but
to
return
to
what
to
where
she
opened
the
door
and
putting
her
umbrella
in
the
stand
that
goes
without
saying
so
too
the
whiff
of
beef
from
the
basement
dot
dot
dot
but
what
i
can
not
thus
eliminate
what
i
must
head
down
eyes
shut
with
the
courage
of
a
battalion
and
the
blindness
of
a
bull
charge
and
disperse
are
indubitably
the
figures
behind
the
ferns
commercial
travellers
there
i
hidden
them
all
this
time
in
the
hope
that
somehow
they
disappear
or
better
still
emerge
as
indeed
they
must
if
the
story
to
go
on
gathering
richness
and
rotundity
destiny
and
tragedy
as
stories
should
rolling
along
with
it
two
if
not
three
commercial
travellers
and
a
whole
grove
of
aspidistra
the
fronds
of
the
aspidistra
only
partly
concealed
the
commercial
traveller
rhododendrons
would
conceal
him
utterly
and
into
the
bargain
give
me
my
fling
of
red
and
white
for
which
i
starve
and
strive
but
rhododendrons
in
eastbourne
in
december
on
the
marshes
table
no
no
i
dare
not
it
all
a
matter
of
crusts
and
cruets
frills
and
ferns
perhaps
there
be
a
moment
later
by
the
sea
moreover
i
feel
pleasantly
pricking
through
the
green
fretwork
and
over
the
glacis
of
cut
glass
a
desire
to
peer
and
peep
at
the
man
opposite
one
as
much
as
i
can
manage
james
moggridge
is
it
whom
the
marshes
call
jimmy
minnie
you
must
promise
not
to
twitch
till
got
this
straight
james
moggridge
travels
in
shall
we
say
buttons
but
the
time
not
come
for
bringing
in
the
big
and
the
little
on
the
long
cards
some
others
dull
gold
cairngorms
some
and
others
coral
sprays
but
i
say
the
time
not
come
he
travels
and
on
thursdays
his
eastbourne
day
takes
his
meals
with
the
marshes
his
red
face
his
little
steady
eyes
by
no
means
altogether
commonplace
his
enormous
appetite
that
safe
he
look
at
minnie
till
the
bread
swamped
the
gravy
dry
napkin
tucked
but
this
is
primitive
and
whatever
it
may
do
the
reader
do
take
me
in
let
dodge
to
the
moggridge
household
set
that
in
motion
well
the
family
boots
are
mended
on
sundays
by
james
himself
he
reads
but
his
passion
roses
and
his
wife
a
retired
hospital
nurse
interesting
for
god
sake
let
me
have
one
woman
with
a
name
i
like
but
no
she
of
the
unborn
children
of
the
mind
illicit
none
the
less
loved
like
my
rhododendrons
how
many
die
in
every
novel
that
written
the
best
the
dearest
while
moggridge
lives
life
fault
here
minnie
eating
her
egg
at
the
moment
opposite
and
at
end
of
the
line
are
we
past
lewes
there
must
be
jimmy
or
what
her
twitch
for
there
must
be
moggridge
life
fault
life
imposes
her
laws
life
blocks
the
way
life
behind
the
fern
life
the
tyrant
oh
but
not
the
bully
no
for
i
assure
you
i
come
willingly
i
come
wooed
by
heaven
knows
what
compulsion
across
ferns
and
cruets
table
splashed
and
bottles
smeared
i
come
irresistibly
to
lodge
myself
somewhere
on
the
firm
flesh
in
the
robust
spine
wherever
i
can
penetrate
or
find
foothold
on
the
person
in
the
soul
of
moggridge
the
man
the
enormous
stability
of
the
fabric
the
spine
tough
as
whalebone
straight
as
the
ribs
radiating
branches
the
flesh
taut
tarpaulin
the
red
hollows
the
suck
and
regurgitation
of
the
heart
while
from
above
meat
falls
in
brown
cubes
and
beer
gushes
to
be
churned
to
blood
again
and
so
we
reach
the
eyes
behind
the
aspidistra
they
see
something
black
white
dismal
now
the
plate
again
behind
the
aspidistra
they
see
elderly
woman
marsh
sister
hilda
more
my
sort
the
tablecloth
now
marsh
would
know
what
wrong
with
morrises
talk
that
over
cheese
has
come
the
plate
again
turn
it
round
the
enormous
fingers
now
the
woman
opposite
marsh
sister
not
a
bit
like
marsh
wretched
elderly
female
you
should
feed
your
hens
god
truth
set
her
twitching
not
what
said
dear
dear
dear
these
elderly
women
dear
dear
yes
minnie
i
know
you
twitched
but
one
moment
james
moggridge
dear
dear
dear
how
beautiful
the
sound
is
like
the
knock
of
a
mallet
on
seasoned
timber
like
the
throb
of
the
heart
of
an
ancient
whaler
when
the
seas
press
thick
and
the
green
is
clouded
dear
dear
what
a
passing
bell
for
the
souls
of
the
fretful
to
soothe
them
and
solace
them
lap
them
in
linen
saying
so
long
good
luck
to
you
and
then
what
your
pleasure
for
though
moggridge
would
pluck
his
rose
for
her
that
done
that
over
now
what
the
next
thing
madam
you
miss
your
train
for
they
do
linger
that
the
man
way
that
the
sound
that
reverberates
that
paul
and
the
but
we
brushing
the
crumbs
off
oh
moggridge
you
wo
stay
you
must
be
off
are
you
driving
through
eastbourne
this
afternoon
in
one
of
those
little
carriages
are
you
the
man
who
walled
up
in
green
cardboard
boxes
and
sometimes
has
the
blinds
down
and
sometimes
sits
so
solemn
staring
like
a
sphinx
and
always
there
a
look
of
the
sepulchral
something
of
the
undertaker
the
coffin
and
the
dusk
about
horse
and
driver
do
tell
me
but
the
doors
slammed
we
shall
never
meet
again
moggridge
farewell
yes
yes
i
coming
right
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
one
moment
linger
how
the
mud
goes
round
in
the
mind
what
a
swirl
these
monsters
leave
the
waters
rocking
the
weeds
waving
and
green
here
black
there
striking
to
the
sand
till
by
degrees
the
atoms
reassemble
the
deposit
sifts
itself
and
again
through
the
eyes
one
sees
clear
and
still
and
there
comes
to
the
lips
some
prayer
for
the
departed
some
obsequy
for
the
souls
of
those
one
nods
to
the
people
one
never
meets
again
james
moggridge
is
dead
now
gone
for
ever
well
minnie
i
can
face
it
no
longer
if
she
said
that
let
me
look
at
her
she
is
brushing
the
eggshell
into
deep
declivities
she
said
it
certainly
leaning
against
the
wall
of
the
bedroom
and
plucking
at
the
little
balls
which
edge
the
curtain
but
when
the
self
speaks
to
the
self
who
is
speaking
the
entombed
soul
the
spirit
driven
in
in
in
to
the
central
catacomb
the
self
that
took
the
veil
and
left
the
world
a
coward
perhaps
yet
somehow
beautiful
as
it
flits
with
its
lantern
restlessly
up
and
down
the
dark
corridors
i
can
bear
it
no
longer
her
spirit
says
that
man
at
lunch
hilda
the
children
oh
heavens
her
sob
it
the
spirit
wailing
its
destiny
the
spirit
driven
hither
thither
lodging
on
the
diminishing
carpets
meagre
footholds
shrunken
shreds
of
all
the
vanishing
universe
love
life
faith
husband
children
i
know
not
what
splendours
and
pageantries
glimpsed
in
girlhood
not
for
me
not
for
me
but
then
the
muffins
the
bald
elderly
dog
bead
mats
i
should
fancy
and
the
consolation
of
underlinen
if
minnie
marsh
were
run
over
and
taken
to
hospital
nurses
and
doctors
themselves
would
exclaim
there
the
vista
and
the
vision
there
the
distance
the
blue
blot
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
while
after
all
the
tea
is
rich
the
muffin
hot
and
the
dog
benny
to
your
basket
sir
and
see
what
brought
you
so
taking
the
glove
with
the
worn
thumb
defying
once
more
the
encroaching
demon
of
what
called
going
in
holes
you
renew
the
fortifications
threading
the
grey
wool
running
it
in
and
out
running
it
in
and
out
across
and
over
spinning
a
web
through
which
god
himself
hush
do
think
of
god
how
firm
the
stitches
are
you
must
be
proud
of
your
darning
let
nothing
disturb
her
let
the
light
fall
gently
and
the
clouds
show
an
inner
vest
of
the
first
green
leaf
let
the
sparrow
perch
on
the
twig
and
shake
the
raindrop
hanging
to
the
twig
elbow
why
look
up
was
it
a
sound
a
thought
oh
heavens
back
again
to
the
thing
you
did
the
plate
glass
with
the
violet
loops
but
hilda
will
come
ignominies
humiliations
oh
close
the
breach
having
mended
her
glove
minnie
marsh
lays
it
in
the
drawer
she
shuts
the
drawer
with
decision
i
catch
sight
of
her
face
in
the
glass
lips
are
pursed
chin
held
high
next
she
laces
her
shoes
then
she
touches
her
throat
what
your
brooch
mistletoe
or
and
what
is
happening
unless
i
much
mistaken
the
pulse
quickened
the
coming
the
threads
are
racing
niagara
ahead
here
the
crisis
heaven
be
with
you
down
she
goes
courage
courage
face
it
be
it
for
god
sake
do
wait
on
the
mat
now
there
the
door
i
on
your
side
speak
confront
her
confound
her
soul
oh
i
beg
your
pardon

is
eastbourne

reach
it
down
for
you

me

the
handle
but

why
do
you
look
about
you
hilda
wo

to
the
station
nor
john
and
moggridge
is
driving
at
the
far
side
of
eastbourne
i
wait
by
my
bag
that
safest
he
said
he
meet
me
oh
there
he
is
that
my
son
so
they
walk
off
together
well
but
i
confounded
surely
minnie
you
know
better
a
strange
young
man
stop
i
tell
him
minnie
miss
marsh
i
do
know
though
there
something
queer
in
her
cloak
as
it
blows
oh
but
untrue
it
indecent
look
how
he
bends
as
they
reach
the
gateway
she
finds
her
ticket
what
the
joke
off
they
go
down
the
road
side
by
side
well
my
world
done
for
what
do
i
stand
on
what
do
i
know
that
not
minnie
there
never
was
moggridge
who
am
i
bare
as
bone
and
yet
the
last
look
of
them
he
stepping
from
the
kerb
and
she
following
him
round
the
edge
of
the
big
building
brims
me
with
wonder
floods
me
anew
mysterious
figures
mother
and
son
who
are
you
why
do
you
walk
down
the
street
where
will
you
sleep
and
then
oh
how
it
whirls
and
surges
floats
me
afresh
i
start
after
them
people
drive
this
way
and
that
the
white
light
splutters
and
pours
windows
carnations
chrysanthemums
ivy
in
dark
gardens
milk
carts
at
the
door
wherever
i
go
mysterious
figures
i
see
you
turning
the
corner
mothers
and
sons
you
you
you
i
hasten
i
follow
this
i
fancy
must
be
the
sea
grey
is
the
landscape
dim
as
ashes
the
water
murmurs
and
moves
if
i
fall
on
my
knees
if
i
go
through
the
ritual
the
ancient
antics
it
you
unknown
figures
you
i
adore
if
i
open
my
arms
it
you
i
embrace
you
i
draw
to
me
adorable
world
the
string
quartet
well
here
we
are
and
if
you
cast
your
eye
over
the
room
you
will
see
that
tubes
and
trams
and
omnibuses
private
carriages
not
a
few
even
i
venture
to
believe
landaus
with
bays
in
them
have
been
busy
at
it
weaving
threads
from
one
end
of
london
to
the
other
yet
i
begin
to
have
my
doubts
if
indeed
it
true
as
they
saying
that
regent
street
is
up
and
the
treaty
signed
and
the
weather
not
cold
for
the
time
of
year
and
even
at
that
rent
not
a
flat
to
be
had
and
the
worst
of
influenza
its
after
effects
if
i
bethink
me
of
having
forgotten
to
write
about
the
leak
in
the
larder
and
left
my
glove
in
the
train
if
the
ties
of
blood
require
me
leaning
forward
to
accept
cordially
the
hand
which
is
perhaps
offered
hesitatingly
seven
years
since
we
met
the
last
time
in
venice
and
where
are
you
living
now
well
the
late
afternoon
suits
me
the
best
though
if
it
asking
too
much
but
i
knew
you
at
once
still
the
war
made
a
break
if
the
mind
shot
through
by
such
little
arrows
and
for
human
society
compels
it
no
sooner
is
one
launched
than
another
presses
forward
if
this
engenders
heat
and
in
addition
they
turned
on
the
electric
light
if
saying
one
thing
does
in
so
many
cases
leave
behind
it
a
need
to
improve
and
revise
stirring
besides
regrets
pleasures
vanities
and
desires
if
it
all
the
facts
i
mean
and
the
hats
the
fur
boas
the
gentlemen
coats
and
pearl
that
come
to
the
surface
what
chance
is
there
of
what
it
becomes
every
minute
more
difficult
to
say
why
in
spite
of
everything
i
sit
here
believing
i
ca
now
say
what
or
even
remember
the
last
time
it
happened
did
you
see
the
procession
the
king
looked
cold
no
no
no
but
what
was
it
she
bought
a
house
at
malmesbury
how
lucky
to
find
one
on
the
contrary
it
seems
to
me
pretty
sure
that
she
whoever
she
may
be
is
damned
since
it
all
a
matter
of
flats
and
hats
and
sea
gulls
or
so
it
seems
to
be
for
a
hundred
people
sitting
here
well
dressed
walled
in
furred
replete
not
that
i
can
boast
since
i
too
sit
passive
on
a
gilt
chair
only
turning
the
earth
above
a
buried
memory
as
we
all
do
for
there
are
signs
if
i
not
mistaken
that
we
all
recalling
something
furtively
seeking
something
why
fidget
why
so
anxious
about
the
sit
of
cloaks
and
gloves
whether
to
button
or
unbutton
then
watch
that
elderly
face
against
the
dark
canvas
a
moment
ago
urbane
and
flushed
now
taciturn
and
sad
as
if
in
shadow
was
it
the
sound
of
the
second
violin
tuning
in
the
here
they
come
four
black
figures
carrying
instruments
and
seat
themselves
facing
the
white
squares
under
the
downpour
of
light
rest
the
tips
of
their
bows
on
the
music
stand
with
a
simultaneous
movement
lift
them
lightly
poise
them
and
looking
across
at
the
player
opposite
the
first
violin
counts
one
two
three
flourish
spring
burgeon
burst
the
pear
tree
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
fountains
jet
drops
descend
but
the
waters
of
the
rhone
flow
swift
and
deep
race
under
the
arches
and
sweep
the
trailing
water
leaves
washing
shadows
over
the
silver
fish
the
spotted
fish
rushed
down
by
the
swift
waters
now
swept
into
an
eddy
where
it
difficult
this
conglomeration
of
fish
all
in
a
pool
leaping
splashing
scraping
sharp
fins
and
such
a
boil
of
current
that
the
yellow
pebbles
are
churned
round
and
round
round
and
round
free
now
rushing
downwards
or
even
somehow
ascending
in
exquisite
spirals
into
the
air
curled
like
thin
shavings
from
under
a
plane
up
and
up
how
lovely
goodness
is
in
those
who
stepping
lightly
go
smiling
through
the
world
also
in
jolly
old
fishwives
squatted
under
arches
obscene
old
women
how
deeply
they
laugh
and
shake
and
rollick
when
they
walk
from
side
to
side
hum
hah
that
an
early
mozart
of
course
but
the
tune
like
all
his
tunes
makes
one
despair
i
mean
hope
what
do
i
mean
that
the
worst
of
music
i
want
to
dance
laugh
eat
pink
cakes
yellow
cakes
drink
thin
sharp
wine
or
an
indecent
story
now
i
could
relish
that
the
older
one
grows
the
more
one
likes
indecency
hah
hah
i
laughing
what
at
you
said
nothing
nor
did
the
old
gentleman
opposite
but
suppose
suppose
hush
the
melancholy
river
bears
us
on
when
the
moon
comes
through
the
trailing
willow
boughs
i
see
your
face
i
hear
your
voice
and
the
bird
singing
as
we
pass
the
osier
bed
what
are
you
whispering
sorrow
sorrow
joy
joy
woven
together
like
reeds
in
moonlight
woven
together
inextricably
commingled
bound
in
pain
and
strewn
in
sorrow
crash
the
boat
sinks
rising
the
figures
ascend
but
now
leaf
thin
tapering
to
a
dusky
wraith
which
fiery
tipped
draws
its
twofold
passion
from
my
heart
for
me
it
sings
unseals
my
sorrow
thaws
compassion
floods
with
love
the
sunless
world
nor
ceasing
abates
its
tenderness
but
deftly
subtly
weaves
in
and
out
until
in
this
pattern
this
consummation
the
cleft
ones
unify
soar
sob
sink
to
rest
sorrow
and
joy
why
then
grieve
ask
what
remain
unsatisfied
i
say
all
been
settled
yes
laid
to
rest
under
a
coverlet
of
rose
leaves
falling
falling
ah
but
they
cease
one
rose
leaf
falling
from
an
enormous
height
like
a
little
parachute
dropped
from
an
invisible
balloon
turns
flutters
waveringly
it
wo
reach
us
no
no
i
noticed
nothing
that
the
worst
of
music
these
silly
dreams
the
second
violin
was
late
you
say
there
old
munro
feeling
her
way
out
blinder
each
year
poor
woman
on
this
slippery
floor
eyeless
old
age
sphinx
there
she
stands
on
the
pavement
beckoning
so
sternly
the
red
omnibus
how
lovely
how
well
they
play
how
how
how
the
tongue
is
but
a
clapper
simplicity
itself
the
feathers
in
the
hat
next
me
are
bright
and
pleasing
as
a
child
rattle
the
leaf
on
the
flashes
green
through
the
chink
in
the
curtain
very
strange
very
exciting
how
how
how
hush
these
are
the
lovers
on
the
grass
if
madam
you
will
take
my
hand
sir
i
would
trust
you
with
my
heart
moreover
we
have
left
our
bodies
in
the
banqueting
hall
those
on
the
turf
are
the
shadows
of
our
souls
then
these
are
the
embraces
of
our
souls
the
lemons
nod
assent
the
swan
pushes
from
the
bank
and
floats
dreaming
into
mid
stream
but
to
return
he
followed
me
down
the
corridor
and
as
we
turned
the
corner
trod
on
the
lace
of
my
petticoat
what
could
i
do
but
cry
and
stop
to
finger
it
at
which
he
drew
his
sword
made
passes
as
if
he
were
stabbing
something
to
death
and
cried
mad
mad
whereupon
i
screamed
and
the
prince
who
was
writing
in
the
large
vellum
book
in
the
oriel
window
came
out
in
his
velvet
and
furred
slippers
snatched
a
rapier
from
the
wall
the
king
of
spain
gift
you
know
on
which
i
escaped
flinging
on
this
cloak
to
hide
the
ravages
to
my
skirt
to
hide
but
listen
the
horns
the
gentleman
replies
so
fast
to
the
lady
and
she
runs
up
the
scale
with
such
witty
exchange
of
compliment
now
culminating
in
a
sob
of
passion
that
the
words
are
indistinguishable
though
the
meaning
is
plain
enough
love
laughter
flight
pursuit
celestial
bliss
all
floated
out
on
the
gayest
ripple
of
tender
endearment
until
the
sound
of
the
silver
horns
at
first
far
distant
gradually
sounds
more
and
more
distinctly
as
if
seneschals
were
saluting
the
dawn
or
proclaiming
ominously
the
escape
of
the
lovers
the
green
garden
moonlit
pool
lemons
lovers
and
fish
are
all
dissolved
in
the
opal
sky
across
which
as
the
horns
are
joined
by
trumpets
and
supported
by
clarions
there
rise
white
arches
firmly
planted
on
marble
pillars
tramp
and
trumpeting
clang
and
clangour
firm
establishment
fast
foundations
march
of
myriads
confusion
and
chaos
trod
to
earth
but
this
city
to
which
we
travel
has
neither
stone
nor
marble
hangs
enduring
stands
unshakable
nor
does
a
face
nor
does
a
flag
greet
or
welcome
leave
then
to
perish
your
hope
droop
in
the
desert
my
joy
naked
advance
bare
are
the
pillars
auspicious
to
none
casting
no
shade
resplendent
severe
back
then
i
fall
eager
no
more
desiring
only
to
go
find
the
street
mark
the
buildings
greet
the
applewoman
say
to
the
maid
who
opens
the
door
a
starry
night
good
night
good
night
you
go
this
way
alas
i
go
that
blue
green
green
the
pointed
fingers
of
glass
hang
downwards
the
light
slides
down
the
glass
and
drops
a
pool
of
green
all
day
long
the
ten
fingers
of
the
lustre
drop
green
upon
the
marble
the
feathers
of
parakeets
their
harsh
cries
sharp
blades
of
palm
trees
green
too
green
needles
glittering
in
the
sun
but
the
hard
glass
drips
on
to
the
marble
the
pools
hover
above
the
dessert
sand
the
camels
lurch
through
them
the
pools
settle
on
the
marble
rushes
edge
them
weeds
clog
them
here
and
there
a
white
blossom
the
frog
flops
over
at
night
the
stars
are
set
there
unbroken
evening
comes
and
the
shadow
sweeps
the
green
over
the
mantelpiece
the
ruffled
surface
of
ocean
no
ships
come
the
aimless
waves
sway
beneath
the
empty
sky
it
night
the
needles
drip
blots
of
blue
the
green
out
blue
the
monster
rises
to
the
surface
and
spouts
through
his
blunt
nostrils
two
columns
of
water
which
in
the
centre
spray
off
into
a
fringe
of
blue
beads
strokes
of
blue
line
the
black
tarpaulin
of
his
hide
slushing
the
water
through
mouth
and
nostrils
he
sings
heavy
with
water
and
the
blue
closes
over
him
dowsing
the
polished
pebbles
of
his
eyes
thrown
upon
the
beach
he
lies
blunt
obtuse
shedding
dry
blue
scales
their
metallic
blue
stains
the
rusty
iron
on
the
beach
blue
are
the
ribs
of
the
wrecked
rowing
boat
a
wave
rolls
beneath
the
blue
bells
but
the
cathedral
different
cold
incense
laden
faint
blue
with
the
veils
of
madonnas
kew
gardens
from
the
there
rose
perhaps
a
hundred
stalks
spreading
into
or
leaves
half
way
up
and
unfurling
at
the
tip
red
or
blue
or
yellow
petals
marked
with
spots
of
colour
raised
upon
the
surface
and
from
the
red
blue
or
yellow
gloom
of
the
throat
emerged
a
straight
bar
rough
with
gold
dust
and
slightly
clubbed
at
the
end
the
petals
were
voluminous
enough
to
be
stirred
by
the
summer
breeze
and
when
they
moved
the
red
blue
and
yellow
lights
passed
one
over
the
other
staining
an
inch
of
the
brown
earth
beneath
with
a
spot
of
the
most
intricate
colour
the
light
fell
either
upon
the
smooth
grey
back
of
a
pebble
or
the
shell
of
a
snail
with
its
brown
circular
veins
or
falling
into
a
raindrop
it
expanded
with
such
intensity
of
red
blue
and
yellow
the
thin
walls
of
water
that
one
expected
them
to
burst
and
disappear
instead
the
drop
was
left
in
a
second
silver
grey
once
more
and
the
light
now
settled
upon
the
flesh
of
a
leaf
revealing
the
branching
thread
of
fibre
beneath
the
surface
and
again
it
moved
on
and
spread
its
illumination
in
the
vast
green
spaces
beneath
the
dome
of
the
and
leaves
then
the
breeze
stirred
rather
more
briskly
overhead
and
the
colour
was
flashed
into
the
air
above
into
the
eyes
of
the
men
and
women
who
walk
in
kew
gardens
in
july
the
figures
of
these
men
and
women
straggled
past
the
with
a
curiously
irregular
movement
not
unlike
that
of
the
white
and
blue
butterflies
who
crossed
the
turf
in
flights
from
bed
to
bed
the
man
was
about
six
inches
in
front
of
the
woman
strolling
carelessly
while
she
bore
on
with
greater
purpose
only
turning
her
head
now
and
then
to
see
that
the
children
were
not
too
far
behind
the
man
kept
this
distance
in
front
of
the
woman
purposely
though
perhaps
unconsciously
for
he
wished
to
go
on
with
his
thoughts
fifteen
years
ago
i
came
here
with
lily
he
thought
we
sat
somewhere
over
there
by
a
lake
and
i
begged
her
to
marry
me
all
through
the
hot
afternoon
how
the
dragonfly
kept
circling
round
us
how
clearly
i
see
the
dragonfly
and
her
shoe
with
the
square
silver
buckle
at
the
toe
all
the
time
i
spoke
i
saw
her
shoe
and
when
it
moved
impatiently
i
knew
without
looking
up
what
she
was
going
to
say
the
whole
of
her
seemed
to
be
in
her
shoe
and
my
love
my
desire
were
in
the
dragonfly
for
some
reason
i
thought
that
if
it
settled
there
on
that
leaf
the
broad
one
with
the
red
flower
in
the
middle
of
it
if
the
dragonfly
settled
on
the
leaf
she
would
say
yes
at
once
but
the
dragonfly
went
round
and
round
it
never
settled
anywhere
of
course
not
happily
not
or
i
should
be
walking
here
with
eleanor
and
the
children
tell
me
eleanor
ever
think
of
the
past
why
do
you
ask
simon
because
i
been
thinking
of
the
past
i
been
thinking
of
lily
the
woman
i
might
have
married
well
why
are
you
silent
do
you
mind
my
thinking
of
the
past
why
should
i
mind
simon
does
one
always
think
of
the
past
in
a
garden
with
men
and
women
lying
under
the
trees
are
they
one
past
all
that
remains
of
it
those
men
and
women
those
ghosts
lying
under
the
trees
one
happiness
one
reality
for
me
a
square
silver
shoe
buckle
and
a
dragonfly
for
me
a
kiss
imagine
six
little
girls
sitting
before
their
easels
twenty
years
ago
down
by
the
side
of
a
lake
painting
the
the
first
red
i
ever
seen
and
suddenly
a
kiss
there
on
the
back
of
my
neck
and
my
hand
shook
all
the
afternoon
so
that
i
could
paint
i
took
out
my
watch
and
marked
the
hour
when
i
would
allow
myself
to
think
of
the
kiss
for
five
minutes
only
it
was
so
precious
the
kiss
of
an
old
woman
with
a
wart
on
her
nose
the
mother
of
all
my
kisses
all
my
life
come
caroline
come
hubert
they
walked
on
past
the
now
walking
four
abreast
and
soon
diminished
in
size
among
the
trees
and
looked
half
transparent
as
the
sunlight
and
shade
swam
over
their
backs
in
large
trembling
irregular
patches
in
the
oval
flower
bed
the
snail
whose
shell
had
been
stained
red
blue
and
yellow
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
or
so
now
appeared
to
be
moving
very
slightly
in
its
shell
and
next
began
to
labour
over
the
crumbs
of
loose
earth
which
broke
away
and
rolled
down
as
it
passed
over
them
it
appeared
to
have
a
definite
goal
in
front
of
it
differing
in
this
respect
from
the
singular
high
stepping
angular
green
insect
who
attempted
to
cross
in
front
of
it
and
waited
for
a
second
with
its
antennæ
trembling
as
if
in
deliberation
and
then
stepped
off
as
rapidly
and
strangely
in
the
opposite
direction
brown
cliffs
with
deep
green
lakes
in
the
hollows
flat
trees
that
waved
from
root
to
tip
round
boulders
of
grey
stone
vast
crumpled
surfaces
of
a
thin
crackling
texture
all
these
objects
lay
across
the
snail
progress
between
one
stalk
and
another
to
his
goal
before
he
had
decided
whether
to
circumvent
the
arched
tent
of
a
dead
leaf
or
to
breast
it
there
came
past
the
bed
the
feet
of
other
human
beings
this
time
they
were
both
men
the
younger
of
the
two
wore
an
expression
of
perhaps
unnatural
calm
he
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
very
steadily
in
front
of
him
while
his
companion
spoke
and
directly
his
companion
had
done
speaking
he
looked
on
the
ground
again
and
sometimes
opened
his
lips
only
after
a
long
pause
and
sometimes
did
not
open
them
at
all
the
elder
man
had
a
curiously
uneven
and
shaky
method
of
walking
jerking
his
hand
forward
and
throwing
up
his
head
abruptly
rather
in
the
manner
of
an
impatient
carriage
horse
tired
of
waiting
outside
a
house
but
in
the
man
these
gestures
were
irresolute
and
pointless
he
talked
almost
incessantly
he
smiled
to
himself
and
again
began
to
talk
as
if
the
smile
had
been
an
answer
he
was
talking
about
spirits
the
spirits
of
the
dead
who
according
to
him
were
even
now
telling
him
all
sorts
of
odd
things
about
their
experiences
in
heaven
heaven
was
known
to
the
ancients
as
thessaly
william
and
now
with
this
war
the
spirit
matter
is
rolling
between
the
hills
like
thunder
he
paused
seemed
to
listen
smiled
jerked
his
head
and
continued
you
have
a
small
electric
battery
and
a
piece
of
rubber
to
insulate
the
wire
isolate
insulate
well
we
skip
the
details
no
good
going
into
details
that
would
be
understood
and
in
short
the
little
machine
stands
in
any
convenient
position
by
the
head
of
the
bed
we
will
say
on
a
neat
mahogany
stand
all
arrangements
being
properly
fixed
by
workmen
under
my
direction
the
widow
applies
her
ear
and
summons
the
spirit
by
sign
as
agreed
women
widows
women
in
black
here
he
seemed
to
have
caught
sight
of
a
woman
dress
in
the
distance
which
in
the
shade
looked
a
purple
black
he
took
off
his
hat
placed
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
hurried
towards
her
muttering
and
gesticulating
feverishly
but
william
caught
him
by
the
sleeve
and
touched
a
flower
with
the
tip
of
his
in
order
to
divert
the
old
man
attention
after
looking
at
it
for
a
moment
in
some
confusion
the
old
man
bent
his
ear
to
it
and
seemed
to
answer
a
voice
speaking
from
it
for
he
began
talking
about
the
forests
of
uruguay
which
he
had
visited
hundreds
of
years
ago
in
company
with
the
most
beautiful
young
woman
in
europe
he
could
be
heard
murmuring
about
forests
of
uruguay
blanketed
with
the
wax
petals
of
tropical
roses
nightingales
sea
beaches
mermaids
and
women
drowned
at
sea
as
he
suffered
himself
to
be
moved
on
by
william
upon
whose
face
the
look
of
stoical
patience
grew
slowly
deeper
and
deeper
following
his
steps
so
closely
as
to
be
slightly
puzzled
by
his
gestures
came
two
elderly
women
of
the
lower
middle
class
one
stout
and
ponderous
the
other
rosy
cheeked
and
nimble
like
most
people
of
their
station
they
were
frankly
fascinated
by
any
signs
of
eccentricity
betokening
a
disordered
brain
especially
in
the
but
they
were
too
far
off
to
be
certain
whether
the
gestures
were
merely
eccentric
or
genuinely
mad
after
they
had
scrutinised
the
old
back
in
silence
for
a
moment
and
given
each
other
a
queer
sly
look
they
went
on
energetically
piecing
together
their
very
complicated
dialogue
nell

the

the
ponderous
woman
looked
through
the
pattern
of
falling
words
at
the
flowers
standing
cool
firm
and
upright
in
the
earth
with
a
curious
expression
she
saw
them
as
a
sleeper
waking
from
a
heavy
sleep
sees
a
brass
candlestick
reflecting
the
light
in
an
unfamiliar
way
and
closes
his
eyes
and
opens
them
and
seeing
the
brass
candlestick
again
finally
starts
broad
awake
and
stares
at
the
candlestick
with
all
his
powers
so
the
heavy
woman
came
to
a
standstill
opposite
the
flower
bed
and
ceased
even
to
pretend
to
listen
to
what
the
other
woman
was
saying
she
stood
there
letting
the
words
fall
over
her
swaying
the
top
part
of
her
body
slowly
backwards
and
forwards
looking
at
the
flowers
then
she
suggested
that
they
should
find
a
seat
and
have
their
tea
the
snail
had
now
considered
every
possible
method
of
reaching
his
goal
without
going
round
the
dead
leaf
or
climbing
over
it
let
alone
the
effort
needed
for
climbing
a
leaf
he
was
doubtful
whether
the
thin
texture
which
vibrated
with
such
an
alarming
crackle
when
touched
even
by
the
tip
of
his
horns
would
bear
his
weight
and
this
determined
him
finally
to
creep
beneath
it
for
there
was
a
point
where
the
leaf
curved
high
enough
from
the
ground
to
admit
him
he
had
just
inserted
his
head
in
the
opening
and
was
taking
stock
of
the
high
brown
roof
and
was
getting
used
to
the
cool
brown
light
when
two
other
people
came
past
outside
on
the
turf
this
time
they
were
both
young
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
they
were
both
in
the
prime
of
youth
or
even
in
that
season
which
precedes
the
prime
of
youth
the
season
before
the
smooth
pink
folds
of
the
flower
have
burst
their
gummy
case
when
the
wings
of
the
butterfly
though
fully
grown
are
motionless
in
the
sun
lucky
it
is
friday
he
observed
why
believe
in
luck
they
make
you
pay
sixpence
on
friday
what
sixpence
anyway
is
it
worth
sixpence
what
what
do
you
mean
by
o
anything
i
mean
you
know
what
i
mean
long
pauses
came
between
each
of
these
remarks
they
were
uttered
in
toneless
and
monotonous
voices
the
couple
stood
still
on
the
edge
of
the
flower
bed
and
together
pressed
the
end
of
her
parasol
deep
down
into
the
soft
earth
the
action
and
the
fact
that
his
hand
rested
on
the
top
of
hers
expressed
their
feelings
in
a
strange
way
as
these
short
insignificant
words
also
expressed
something
words
with
short
wings
for
their
heavy
body
of
meaning
inadequate
to
carry
them
far
and
thus
alighting
awkwardly
upon
the
very
common
objects
that
surrounded
them
and
were
to
their
inexperienced
touch
so
massive
but
who
knows
so
they
thought
as
they
pressed
the
parasol
into
the
earth
what
precipices
are
concealed
in
them
or
what
slopes
of
ice
do
shine
in
the
sun
on
the
other
side
who
knows
who
has
ever
seen
this
before
even
when
she
wondered
what
sort
of
tea
they
gave
you
at
kew
he
felt
that
something
loomed
up
behind
her
words
and
stood
vast
and
solid
behind
them
and
the
mist
very
slowly
rose
and
uncovered
o
heavens
what
were
those
shapes
little
white
tables
and
waitresses
who
looked
first
at
her
and
then
at
him
and
there
was
a
bill
that
he
would
pay
with
a
real
two
shilling
piece
and
it
was
real
all
real
he
assured
himself
fingering
the
coin
in
his
pocket
real
to
everyone
except
to
him
and
to
her
even
to
him
it
began
to
seem
real
and
then
but
it
was
too
exciting
to
stand
and
think
any
longer
and
he
pulled
the
parasol
out
of
the
earth
with
a
jerk
and
was
impatient
to
find
the
place
where
one
had
tea
with
other
people
like
other
people
come
along
trissie
it
time
we
had
our
tea
wherever
one
have
one
tea
she
asked
with
the
oddest
thrill
of
excitement
in
her
voice
looking
vaguely
round
and
letting
herself
be
drawn
on
down
the
grass
path
trailing
her
parasol
turning
her
head
this
way
and
that
way
forgetting
her
tea
wishing
to
go
down
there
and
then
down
there
remembering
orchids
and
cranes
among
wild
flowers
a
chinese
pagoda
and
a
crimson
crested
bird
but
he
bore
her
on
thus
one
couple
after
another
with
much
the
same
irregular
and
aimless
movement
passed
the
and
were
enveloped
in
layer
after
layer
of
green
blue
vapour
in
which
at
first
their
bodies
had
substance
and
a
dash
of
colour
but
later
both
substance
and
colour
dissolved
in
the
atmosphere
how
hot
it
was
so
hot
that
even
the
thrush
chose
to
hop
like
a
mechanical
bird
in
the
shadow
of
the
flowers
with
long
pauses
between
one
movement
and
the
next
instead
of
rambling
vaguely
the
white
butterflies
danced
one
above
another
making
with
their
white
shifting
flakes
the
outline
of
a
shattered
marble
column
above
the
tallest
flowers
the
glass
roofs
of
the
palm
house
shone
as
if
a
whole
market
full
of
shiny
green
umbrellas
had
opened
in
the
sun
and
in
the
drone
of
the
aeroplane
the
voice
of
the
summer
sky
murmured
its
fierce
soul
yellow
and
black
pink
and
snow
white
shapes
of
all
these
colours
men
women
and
children
were
spotted
for
a
second
upon
the
horizon
and
then
seeing
the
breadth
of
yellow
that
lay
upon
the
grass
they
wavered
and
sought
shade
beneath
the
trees
dissolving
like
drops
of
water
in
the
yellow
and
green
atmosphere
staining
it
faintly
with
red
and
blue
it
seemed
as
if
all
gross
and
heavy
bodies
had
sunk
down
in
the
heat
motionless
and
lay
huddled
upon
the
ground
but
their
voices
went
wavering
from
them
as
if
they
were
flames
lolling
from
the
thick
waxen
bodies
of
candles
voices
yes
voices
wordless
voices
breaking
the
silence
suddenly
with
such
depth
of
contentment
such
passion
of
desire
or
in
the
voices
of
children
such
freshness
of
surprise
breaking
the
silence
but
there
was
no
silence
all
the
time
the
motor
omnibuses
were
turning
their
wheels
and
changing
their
gear
like
a
vast
nest
of
chinese
boxes
all
of
wrought
steel
turning
ceaselessly
one
within
another
the
city
murmured
on
the
top
of
which
the
voices
cried
aloud
and
the
petals
of
myriads
of
flowers
flashed
their
colours
into
the
air
the
mark
on
the
wall
perhaps
it
was
the
middle
of
january
in
the
present
year
that
i
first
looked
up
and
saw
the
mark
on
the
wall
in
order
to
fix
a
date
it
is
necessary
to
remember
what
one
saw
so
now
i
think
of
the
fire
the
steady
film
of
yellow
light
upon
the
page
of
my
book
the
three
chrysanthemums
in
the
round
glass
bowl
on
the
mantelpiece
yes
it
must
have
been
the
winter
time
and
we
had
just
finished
our
tea
for
i
remember
that
i
was
smoking
a
cigarette
when
i
looked
up
and
saw
the
mark
on
the
wall
for
the
first
time
i
looked
up
through
the
smoke
of
my
cigarette
and
my
eye
lodged
for
a
moment
upon
the
burning
coals
and
that
old
fancy
of
the
crimson
flag
flapping
from
the
castle
tower
came
into
my
mind
and
i
thought
of
the
cavalcade
of
red
knights
riding
up
the
side
of
the
black
rock
rather
to
my
relief
the
sight
of
the
mark
interrupted
the
fancy
for
it
is
an
old
fancy
an
automatic
fancy
made
as
a
child
perhaps
the
mark
was
a
small
round
mark
black
upon
the
white
wall
about
six
or
seven
inches
above
the
mantelpiece
how
readily
our
thoughts
swarm
upon
a
new
object
lifting
it
a
little
way
as
ants
carry
a
blade
of
straw
so
feverishly
and
then
leave
it
if
that
mark
was
made
by
a
nail
it
ca
have
been
for
a
picture
it
must
have
been
for
a
miniature
the
miniature
of
a
lady
with
white
powdered
curls
cheeks
and
lips
like
red
carnations
a
fraud
of
course
for
the
people
who
had
this
house
before
us
would
have
chosen
pictures
in
that
way
an
old
picture
for
an
old
room
that
is
the
sort
of
people
they
were
very
interesting
people
and
i
think
of
them
so
often
in
such
queer
places
because
one
will
never
see
them
again
never
know
what
happened
next
they
wanted
to
leave
this
house
because
they
wanted
to
change
their
style
of
furniture
so
he
said
and
he
was
in
process
of
saying
that
in
his
opinion
art
should
have
ideas
behind
it
when
we
were
torn
asunder
as
one
is
torn
from
the
old
lady
about
to
pour
out
tea
and
the
young
man
about
to
hit
the
tennis
ball
in
the
back
garden
of
the
suburban
villa
as
one
rushes
past
in
the
train
but
as
for
that
mark
i
not
sure
about
it
i
do
believe
it
was
made
by
a
nail
after
all
it
too
big
too
round
for
that
i
might
get
up
but
if
i
got
up
and
looked
at
it
ten
to
one
i
should
be
able
to
say
for
certain
because
once
a
thing
done
no
one
ever
knows
how
it
happened
oh
dear
me
the
mystery
of
life
the
inaccuracy
of
thought
the
ignorance
of
humanity
to
show
how
very
little
control
of
our
possessions
we
have
what
an
accidental
affair
this
living
is
after
all
our
civilization
let
me
just
count
over
a
few
of
the
things
lost
in
one
lifetime
beginning
for
that
seems
always
the
most
mysterious
of
losses
what
cat
would
gnaw
what
rat
would
nibble
three
pale
blue
canisters
of
tools
then
there
were
the
bird
cages
the
iron
hoops
the
steel
skates
the
queen
anne
the
bagatelle
board
the
hand
organ
all
gone
and
jewels
too
opals
and
emeralds
they
lie
about
the
roots
of
turnips
what
a
scraping
paring
affair
it
is
to
be
sure
the
wonder
is
that
i
any
clothes
on
my
back
that
i
sit
surrounded
by
solid
furniture
at
this
moment
why
if
one
wants
to
compare
life
to
anything
one
must
liken
it
to
being
blown
through
the
tube
at
fifty
miles
an
hour
landing
at
the
other
end
without
a
single
hairpin
in
one
hair
shot
out
at
the
feet
of
god
entirely
naked
tumbling
head
over
heels
in
the
asphodel
meadows
like
brown
paper
parcels
pitched
down
a
shoot
in
the
post
office
with
one
hair
flying
back
like
the
tail
of
a
yes
that
seems
to
express
the
rapidity
of
life
the
perpetual
waste
and
repair
all
so
casual
all
so
haphazard
but
after
life
the
slow
pulling
down
of
thick
green
stalks
so
that
the
cup
of
the
flower
as
it
turns
over
deluges
one
with
purple
and
red
light
why
after
all
should
one
not
be
born
there
as
one
is
born
here
helpless
speechless
unable
to
focus
one
eyesight
groping
at
the
roots
of
the
grass
at
the
toes
of
the
giants
as
for
saying
which
are
trees
and
which
are
men
and
women
or
whether
there
are
such
things
that
one
wo
be
in
a
condition
to
do
for
fifty
years
or
so
there
will
be
nothing
but
spaces
of
light
and
dark
intersected
by
thick
stalks
and
rather
higher
up
perhaps
blots
of
an
indistinct
colour
dim
pinks
and
blues
which
will
as
time
goes
on
become
more
definite
become
i
do
know
what
and
yet
that
mark
on
the
wall
is
not
a
hole
at
all
it
may
even
be
caused
by
some
round
black
substance
such
as
a
small
rose
leaf
left
over
from
the
summer
and
i
not
being
a
very
vigilant
housekeeper
look
at
the
dust
on
the
mantelpiece
for
example
the
dust
which
so
they
say
buried
troy
three
times
over
only
fragments
of
pots
utterly
refusing
annihilation
as
one
can
believe
the
tree
outside
the
window
taps
very
gently
on
the
pane
i
want
to
think
quietly
calmly
spaciously
never
to
be
interrupted
never
to
have
to
rise
from
my
chair
to
slip
easily
from
one
thing
to
another
without
any
sense
of
hostility
or
obstacle
i
want
to
sink
deeper
and
deeper
away
from
the
surface
with
its
hard
separate
facts
to
steady
myself
let
me
catch
hold
of
the
first
idea
that
passes
shakespeare
well
he
will
do
as
well
as
another
a
man
who
sat
himself
solidly
in
an
and
looked
into
the
fire
so
a
shower
of
ideas
fell
perpetually
from
some
very
high
heaven
down
through
his
mind
he
leant
his
forehead
on
his
hand
and
people
looking
in
through
the
open
door
for
this
scene
is
supposed
to
take
place
on
a
evening
but
how
dull
this
is
this
historical
fiction
it
interest
me
at
all
i
wish
i
could
hit
upon
a
pleasant
track
of
thought
a
track
indirectly
reflecting
credit
upon
myself
for
those
are
the
pleasantest
thoughts
and
very
frequent
even
in
the
minds
of
modest
people
who
believe
genuinely
that
they
dislike
to
hear
their
own
praises
they
are
not
thoughts
directly
praising
oneself
that
is
the
beauty
of
them
they
are
thoughts
like
this
and
then
i
came
into
the
room
they
were
discussing
botany
i
said
how
i
seen
a
flower
growing
on
a
dust
heap
on
the
site
of
an
old
house
in
kingsway
the
seed
i
said
must
have
been
sown
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
first
what
flowers
grew
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
first
i
asked
but
i
do
remember
the
answer
tall
flowers
with
purple
tassels
to
them
perhaps
and
so
it
goes
on
all
the
time
i
dressing
up
the
figure
of
myself
in
my
own
mind
lovingly
stealthily
not
openly
adoring
it
for
if
i
did
that
i
should
catch
myself
out
and
stretch
my
hand
at
once
for
a
book
in
indeed
it
is
curious
how
instinctively
one
protects
the
image
of
oneself
from
idolatry
or
any
other
handling
that
could
make
it
ridiculous
or
too
unlike
the
original
to
be
believed
in
any
longer
or
is
it
not
so
very
curious
after
all
it
is
a
matter
of
great
importance
suppose
the
looking
glass
smashes
the
image
disappears
and
the
romantic
figure
with
the
green
of
forest
depths
all
about
it
is
there
no
longer
but
only
that
shell
of
a
person
which
is
seen
by
other
people
what
an
airless
shallow
bald
prominent
world
it
becomes
a
world
not
to
be
lived
in
as
we
face
each
other
in
omnibuses
and
underground
railways
we
are
looking
into
the
mirror
that
accounts
for
the
vagueness
the
gleam
of
glassiness
in
our
eyes
and
the
novelists
in
future
will
realize
more
and
more
the
importance
of
these
reflections
for
of
course
there
is
not
one
reflection
but
an
almost
infinite
number
those
are
the
depths
they
will
explore
those
the
phantoms
they
will
pursue
leaving
the
description
of
reality
more
and
more
out
of
their
stories
taking
a
knowledge
of
it
for
granted
as
the
greeks
did
and
shakespeare
perhaps
but
these
generalizations
are
very
worthless
the
military
sound
of
the
word
is
enough
it
recalls
leading
articles
cabinet
ministers
a
whole
class
of
things
indeed
which
as
a
child
one
thought
the
thing
itself
the
standard
thing
the
real
thing
from
which
one
could
not
depart
save
at
the
risk
of
nameless
damnation
generalizations
bring
back
somehow
sunday
in
london
sunday
afternoon
walks
sunday
luncheons
and
also
ways
of
speaking
of
the
dead
clothes
and
habits
like
the
habit
of
sitting
all
together
in
one
room
until
a
certain
hour
although
nobody
liked
it
there
was
a
rule
for
everything
the
rule
for
tablecloths
at
that
particular
period
was
that
they
should
be
made
of
tapestry
with
little
yellow
compartments
marked
upon
them
such
as
you
may
see
in
photographs
of
the
carpets
in
the
corridors
of
the
royal
palaces
tablecloths
of
a
different
kind
were
not
real
tablecloths
how
shocking
and
yet
how
wonderful
it
was
to
discover
that
these
real
things
sunday
luncheons
sunday
walks
country
houses
and
tablecloths
were
not
entirely
real
were
indeed
half
phantoms
and
the
damnation
which
visited
the
disbeliever
in
them
was
only
a
sense
of
illegitimate
freedom
what
now
takes
the
place
of
those
things
i
wonder
those
real
standard
things
men
perhaps
should
you
be
a
woman
the
masculine
point
of
view
which
governs
our
lives
which
sets
the
standard
which
establishes
whitaker
table
of
precedency
which
has
become
i
suppose
since
the
war
half
a
phantom
to
many
men
and
women
which
soon
one
may
hope
will
be
laughed
into
the
dustbin
where
the
phantoms
go
the
mahogany
sideboards
and
the
landseer
prints
gods
and
devils
hell
and
so
forth
leaving
us
all
with
an
intoxicating
sense
of
illegitimate
freedom
if
freedom
exists
in
certain
lights
that
mark
on
the
wall
seems
actually
to
project
from
the
wall
nor
is
it
entirely
circular
i
can
not
be
sure
but
it
seems
to
cast
a
perceptible
shadow
suggesting
that
if
i
ran
my
finger
down
that
strip
of
the
wall
it
would
at
a
certain
point
mount
and
descend
a
small
tumulus
a
smooth
tumulus
like
those
barrows
on
the
south
downs
which
are
they
say
either
tombs
or
camps
of
the
two
i
should
prefer
them
to
be
tombs
desiring
melancholy
like
most
english
people
and
finding
it
natural
at
the
end
of
a
walk
to
think
of
the
bones
stretched
beneath
the
turf
there
must
be
some
book
about
it
some
antiquary
must
have
dug
up
those
bones
and
given
them
a
name
what
sort
of
a
man
is
an
antiquary
i
wonder
retired
colonels
for
the
most
part
i
daresay
leading
parties
of
aged
labourers
to
the
top
here
examining
clods
of
earth
and
stone
and
getting
into
correspondence
with
the
neighbouring
clergy
which
being
opened
at
breakfast
time
gives
them
a
feeling
of
importance
and
the
comparison
of
necessitates
journeys
to
the
county
towns
an
agreeable
necessity
both
to
them
and
to
their
elderly
wives
who
wish
to
make
plum
jam
or
to
clean
out
the
study
and
have
every
reason
for
keeping
that
great
question
of
the
camp
or
the
tomb
in
perpetual
suspension
while
the
colonel
himself
feels
agreeably
philosophic
in
accumulating
evidence
on
both
sides
of
the
question
it
is
true
that
he
does
finally
incline
to
believe
in
the
camp
and
being
opposed
indites
a
pamphlet
which
he
is
about
to
read
at
the
quarterly
meeting
of
the
local
society
when
a
stroke
lays
him
low
and
his
last
conscious
thoughts
are
not
of
wife
or
child
but
of
the
camp
and
that
arrowhead
there
which
is
now
in
the
case
at
the
local
museum
together
with
the
foot
of
a
chinese
murderess
a
handful
of
elizabethan
nails
a
great
many
tudor
clay
pipes
a
piece
of
roman
pottery
and
the
that
nelson
drank
out
of
proving
i
really
do
know
what
no
no
nothing
is
proved
nothing
is
known
and
if
i
were
to
get
up
at
this
very
moment
and
ascertain
that
the
mark
on
the
wall
is
really
what
shall
we
say
the
head
of
a
gigantic
old
nail
driven
in
two
hundred
years
ago
which
has
now
owing
to
the
patient
attrition
of
many
generations
of
housemaids
revealed
its
head
above
the
coat
of
paint
and
is
taking
its
first
view
of
modern
life
in
the
sight
of
a
room
what
should
i
gain
knowledge
matter
for
further
speculation
i
can
think
sitting
still
as
well
as
standing
up
and
what
is
knowledge
what
are
our
learned
men
save
the
descendants
of
witches
and
hermits
who
crouched
in
caves
and
in
woods
brewing
herbs
interrogating
and
writing
down
the
language
of
the
stars
and
the
less
we
honour
them
as
our
superstitions
dwindle
and
our
respect
for
beauty
and
health
of
mind
increases
yes
one
could
imagine
a
very
pleasant
world
a
quiet
spacious
world
with
the
flowers
so
red
and
blue
in
the
open
fields
a
world
without
professors
or
specialists
or
with
the
profiles
of
policemen
a
world
which
one
could
slice
with
one
thought
as
a
fish
slices
the
water
with
his
fin
grazing
the
stems
of
the
hanging
suspended
over
nests
of
white
sea
eggs
how
peaceful
it
is
down
here
rooted
in
the
centre
of
the
world
and
gazing
up
through
the
grey
waters
with
their
sudden
gleams
of
light
and
their
reflections
if
it
were
not
for
almanack
if
it
were
not
for
the
table
of
precedency
i
must
jump
up
and
see
for
myself
what
that
mark
on
the
wall
really
is
a
nail
a
a
crack
in
the
wood
here
is
nature
once
more
at
her
old
game
of
this
train
of
thought
she
perceives
is
threatening
mere
waste
of
energy
even
some
collision
with
reality
for
who
will
ever
be
able
to
lift
a
finger
against
whitaker
table
of
precedency
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
is
followed
by
the
lord
high
chancellor
the
lord
high
chancellor
is
followed
by
the
archbishop
of
york
everybody
follows
somebody
such
is
the
philosophy
of
whitaker
and
the
great
thing
is
to
know
who
follows
whom
whitaker
knows
and
let
that
so
nature
counsels
comfort
you
instead
of
enraging
you
and
if
you
ca
be
comforted
if
you
must
shatter
this
hour
of
peace
think
of
the
mark
on
the
wall
i
understand
nature
game
her
prompting
to
take
action
as
a
way
of
ending
any
thought
that
threatens
to
excite
or
to
pain
hence
i
suppose
comes
our
slight
contempt
for
men
of
action
men
we
assume
who
do
think
still
there
no
harm
in
putting
a
full
stop
to
disagreeable
thoughts
by
looking
at
a
mark
on
the
wall
indeed
now
that
i
have
fixed
my
eyes
upon
it
i
feel
that
i
have
grasped
a
plank
in
the
sea
i
feel
a
satisfying
sense
of
reality
which
at
once
turns
the
two
archbishops
and
the
lord
high
chancellor
to
the
shadows
of
shades
here
is
something
definite
something
real
thus
waking
from
a
midnight
dream
of
horror
one
hastily
turns
on
the
light
and
lies
quiescent
worshipping
the
chest
of
drawers
worshipping
solidity
worshipping
reality
worshipping
the
impersonal
world
which
is
a
proof
of
some
existence
other
than
ours
that
is
what
one
wants
to
be
sure
of
wood
is
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
about
it
comes
from
a
tree
and
trees
grow
and
we
do
know
how
they
grow
for
years
and
years
they
grow
without
paying
any
attention
to
us
in
meadows
in
forests
and
by
the
side
of
rivers
all
things
one
likes
to
think
about
the
cows
swish
their
tails
beneath
them
on
hot
afternoons
they
paint
rivers
so
green
that
when
a
moorhen
dives
one
expects
to
see
its
feathers
all
green
when
it
comes
up
again
i
like
to
think
of
the
fish
balanced
against
the
stream
like
flags
blown
out
and
of
slowly
raising
domes
of
mud
upon
the
bed
of
the
river
i
like
to
think
of
the
tree
itself
first
the
close
dry
sensation
of
being
wood
then
the
grinding
of
the
storm
then
the
slow
delicious
ooze
of
sap
i
like
to
think
of
it
too
on
winter
nights
standing
in
the
empty
field
with
all
leaves
nothing
tender
exposed
to
the
iron
bullets
of
the
moon
a
naked
mast
upon
an
earth
that
goes
tumbling
tumbling
all
night
long
the
song
of
birds
must
sound
very
loud
and
strange
in
june
and
how
cold
the
feet
of
insects
must
feel
upon
it
as
they
make
laborious
progresses
up
the
creases
of
the
bark
or
sun
themselves
upon
the
thin
green
awning
of
the
leaves
and
look
straight
in
front
of
them
with
red
eyes
one
by
one
the
fibres
snap
beneath
the
immense
cold
pressure
of
the
earth
then
the
last
storm
comes
and
falling
the
highest
branches
drive
deep
into
the
ground
again
even
so
life
is
done
with
there
are
a
million
patient
watchful
lives
still
for
a
tree
all
over
the
world
in
bedrooms
in
ships
on
the
pavement
lining
rooms
where
men
and
women
sit
after
tea
smoking
cigarettes
it
is
full
of
peaceful
thoughts
happy
thoughts
this
tree
i
should
like
to
take
each
one
separately
but
something
is
getting
in
the
way
where
was
i
what
has
it
all
been
about
a
tree
a
river
the
downs
whitaker
almanack
the
fields
of
asphodel
i
ca
remember
a
thing
everything
moving
falling
slipping
vanishing
there
is
a
vast
upheaval
of
matter
someone
is
standing
over
me
and
saying
i
going
out
to
buy
a
newspaper
yes
though
it
no
good
buying
newspapers
nothing
ever
happens
curse
this
war
god
damn
this
war
all
the
same
i
do
see
why
we
should
have
a
snail
on
our
wall
ah
the
mark
on
the
wall
it
was
a
snail
