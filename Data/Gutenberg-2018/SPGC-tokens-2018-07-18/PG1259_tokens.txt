conclusion
the
shade
of
cardinal
richelieu
in
a
splendid
chamber
of
the
palais
royal
formerly
styled
the
palais
cardinal
a
man
was
sitting
in
deep
reverie
his
head
supported
on
his
hands
leaning
over
a
gilt
and
inlaid
table
which
was
covered
with
letters
and
papers
behind
this
figure
glowed
a
vast
fireplace
alive
with
leaping
flames
great
logs
of
oak
blazed
and
crackled
on
the
polished
brass
andirons
whose
flicker
shone
upon
the
superb
habiliments
of
the
lonely
tenant
of
the
room
which
was
illumined
grandly
by
twin
candelabra
rich
with
any
one
who
happened
at
that
moment
to
contemplate
that
red
simar
the
gorgeous
robe
of
office
and
the
rich
lace
or
who
gazed
on
that
pale
brow
bent
in
anxious
meditation
might
in
the
solitude
of
that
apartment
combined
with
the
silence
of
the
and
the
measured
paces
of
the
guards
upon
the
have
fancied
that
the
shade
of
cardinal
richelieu
lingered
still
in
his
accustomed
haunt
it
was
alas
the
ghost
of
former
greatness
france
enfeebled
the
authority
of
her
sovereign
contemned
her
nobles
returning
to
their
former
turbulence
and
insolence
her
enemies
within
her
frontiers
all
proved
the
great
richelieu
no
longer
in
existence
in
truth
that
the
red
simar
which
occupied
the
wonted
place
was
his
no
longer
was
still
more
strikingly
obvious
from
the
isolation
which
seemed
as
we
have
observed
more
appropriate
to
a
phantom
than
a
living
creature
from
the
corridors
deserted
by
courtiers
and
courts
crowded
with
guards
from
that
spirit
of
bitter
ridicule
which
arising
from
the
streets
below
penetrated
through
the
very
casements
of
the
room
which
resounded
with
the
murmurs
of
a
whole
city
leagued
against
the
minister
as
well
as
from
the
distant
and
incessant
sounds
of
guns
firing
let
off
happily
without
other
end
or
aim
except
to
show
to
the
guards
the
swiss
troops
and
the
military
who
surrounded
the
palais
royal
that
the
people
were
possessed
of
arms
the
shade
of
richelieu
was
mazarin
now
mazarin
was
alone
and
defenceless
as
he
well
knew
foreigner
he
ejaculated
italian
that
is
their
mean
yet
mighty
byword
of
reproach
the
watchword
with
which
they
assassinated
hanged
and
made
away
with
concini
and
if
i
gave
them
their
way
they
would
assassinate
hang
and
make
away
with
me
in
the
same
manner
although
they
have
nothing
to
complain
of
except
a
tax
or
two
now
and
then
idiots
ignorant
of
their
real
enemies
they
do
not
perceive
that
it
is
not
the
italian
who
speaks
french
badly
but
those
who
can
say
fine
things
to
them
in
the
purest
parisian
accent
who
are
their
real
foes
yes
yes
mazarin
continued
whilst
his
wonted
smile
full
of
subtlety
lent
a
strange
expression
to
his
pale
lips
yes
these
noises
prove
to
me
indeed
that
the
destiny
of
favorites
is
precarious
but
ye
shall
know
i
am
no
ordinary
favorite
no
the
earl
of
essex
tis
true
wore
a
splendid
ring
set
with
diamonds
given
him
by
his
royal
mistress
whilst
i
i
have
nothing
but
a
simple
circlet
of
gold
with
a
cipher
on
it
and
a
date
but
that
ring
has
been
blessed
in
the
chapel
of
the
palais
royal
so
they
will
never
ruin
me
as
they
long
to
do
and
whilst
they
shout
down
with
mazarin
i
unknown
and
unperceived
by
them
incite
them
to
cry
out
long
live
the
duke
de
beaufort
one
day
another
long
live
the
prince
de
conde
and
again
long
live
the
parliament
and
at
this
word
the
smile
on
the
cardinal
s
lips
assumed
an
expression
of
hatred
of
which
his
mild
countenance
seemed
incapable
the
parliament
we
shall
soon
see
how
to
dispose
he
continued
of
the
parliament
both
orleans
and
montargis
are
ours
it
will
be
a
work
of
time
but
those
who
have
begun
by
crying
out
down
with
mazarin
will
finish
by
shouting
out
down
with
all
the
people
i
have
mentioned
each
in
his
turn
it
is
said
that
mazarin
who
though
a
cardinal
had
such
vows
as
to
prevent
it
was
secretly
married
of
la
porte
s
richelieu
whom
they
hated
during
his
lifetime
and
whom
they
now
praise
after
his
death
was
even
less
popular
than
i
am
often
he
was
driven
away
oftener
still
had
he
a
dread
of
being
sent
away
the
queen
will
never
banish
me
and
even
were
i
obliged
to
yield
to
the
populace
she
would
yield
with
me
if
i
fly
she
will
fly
and
then
we
shall
see
how
the
rebels
will
get
on
without
either
king
or
queen
oh
were
i
not
a
foreigner
were
i
but
a
frenchman
were
i
but
of
gentle
birth
the
position
of
the
cardinal
was
indeed
critical
and
recent
events
had
added
to
his
difficulties
discontent
had
long
pervaded
the
lower
ranks
of
society
in
france
crushed
and
impoverished
by
taxation
imposed
by
mazarin
whose
avarice
impelled
him
to
grind
them
down
to
the
very
dust
the
people
as
the
talon
described
it
had
nothing
left
to
them
except
their
souls
and
as
those
could
not
be
sold
by
auction
they
began
to
murmur
patience
had
in
vain
been
recommended
to
them
by
reports
of
brilliant
victories
gained
by
france
laurels
however
were
not
meat
and
drink
and
the
people
had
for
some
time
been
in
a
state
of
discontent
had
this
been
all
it
might
not
perhaps
have
greatly
signified
for
when
the
lower
classes
alone
complained
the
court
of
france
separated
as
it
was
from
the
poor
by
the
intervening
classes
of
the
gentry
and
the
bourgeoisie
seldom
listened
to
their
voice
but
unluckily
mazarin
had
had
the
imprudence
to
attack
the
magistrates
and
had
sold
no
less
than
twelve
appointments
in
the
court
of
requests
at
a
high
price
and
as
the
officers
of
that
court
paid
very
dearly
for
their
places
and
as
the
addition
of
twelve
new
colleagues
would
necessarily
lower
the
value
of
each
place
the
old
functionaries
formed
a
union
amongst
themselves
and
enraged
swore
on
the
bible
not
to
allow
of
this
addition
to
their
number
but
to
resist
all
the
persecutions
which
might
ensue
and
should
any
one
of
them
chance
to
forfeit
his
post
by
this
resistance
to
combine
to
indemnify
him
for
his
loss
now
the
following
occurrences
had
taken
place
between
the
two
contending
parties
on
the
seventh
of
january
between
seven
and
eight
hundred
tradesmen
had
assembled
in
paris
to
discuss
a
new
tax
which
was
to
be
levied
on
house
property
they
deputed
ten
of
their
number
to
wait
upon
the
duke
of
orleans
who
according
to
his
custom
affected
popularity
the
duke
received
them
and
they
informed
him
that
they
were
resolved
not
to
pay
this
tax
even
if
they
were
obliged
to
defend
themselves
against
its
collectors
by
force
of
arms
they
were
listened
to
with
great
politeness
by
the
duke
who
held
out
hopes
of
easier
measures
promised
to
speak
in
their
behalf
to
the
queen
and
dismissed
them
with
the
ordinary
expression
of
royalty
we
will
see
what
we
can
two
days
afterward
these
same
magistrates
appeared
before
the
cardinal
and
their
spokesman
addressed
mazarin
with
so
much
fearlessness
and
determination
that
the
minister
was
astounded
and
sent
the
deputation
away
with
the
same
answer
as
it
had
received
from
the
duke
of
orleans
that
he
would
see
what
could
be
done
and
in
accordance
with
that
intention
a
council
of
state
was
assembled
and
the
superintendent
of
finance
was
summoned
this
man
named
emery
was
the
object
of
popular
detestation
in
the
first
place
because
he
was
superintendent
of
finance
and
every
superintendent
of
finance
deserved
to
be
hated
in
the
second
place
because
he
rather
deserved
the
odium
which
he
had
incurred
he
was
the
son
of
a
banker
at
lyons
named
particelli
who
after
becoming
a
bankrupt
chose
to
change
his
name
to
emery
and
cardinal
richelieu
having
discovered
in
him
great
financial
aptitude
had
introduced
him
with
a
strong
recommendation
to
louis
xiii
under
his
assumed
name
in
order
that
he
might
be
appointed
to
the
post
he
subsequently
held
you
surprise
me
exclaimed
the
monarch
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
you
speak
of
monsieur
d
emery
as
calculated
for
a
post
which
requires
a
man
of
probity
i
was
really
afraid
that
you
were
going
to
force
that
villain
particelli
upon
sire
replied
richelieu
rest
assured
that
particelli
the
man
to
whom
your
majesty
refers
has
been
ah
so
much
the
better
exclaimed
the
king
it
is
not
for
nothing
that
i
am
styled
louis
the
just
and
he
signed
emery
s
appointment
this
was
the
same
emery
who
became
eventually
superintendent
of
finance
he
was
sent
for
by
the
ministers
and
he
came
before
them
pale
and
trembling
declaring
that
his
son
had
very
nearly
been
assassinated
the
day
before
near
the
palace
the
mob
had
insulted
him
on
account
of
the
ostentatious
luxury
of
his
wife
whose
house
was
hung
with
red
velvet
edged
with
gold
fringe
this
lady
was
the
daughter
of
nicholas
de
camus
who
arrived
in
paris
with
twenty
francs
in
his
pocket
became
secretary
of
state
and
accumulated
wealth
enough
to
divide
nine
millions
of
francs
among
his
children
and
to
keep
an
income
of
forty
thousand
for
himself
the
fact
was
that
emery
s
son
had
run
a
great
chance
of
being
suffocated
one
of
the
rioters
having
proposed
to
squeeze
him
until
he
gave
up
all
the
gold
he
had
swallowed
nothing
therefore
was
settled
that
day
as
emery
s
head
was
not
steady
enough
for
business
after
such
an
occurrence
on
the
next
day
mathieu
mole
the
chief
president
whose
courage
at
this
crisis
says
the
cardinal
de
retz
was
equal
to
that
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
and
the
prince
de
conde
in
other
words
of
the
two
men
who
were
considered
the
bravest
in
france
had
been
attacked
in
his
turn
the
people
threatened
to
hold
him
responsible
for
the
evils
that
hung
over
them
but
the
chief
president
had
replied
with
his
habitual
coolness
without
betraying
either
disturbance
or
surprise
that
should
the
agitators
refuse
obedience
to
the
king
s
wishes
he
would
have
gallows
erected
in
the
public
squares
and
proceed
at
once
to
hang
the
most
active
among
them
to
which
the
others
had
responded
that
they
would
be
glad
to
see
the
gallows
erected
they
would
serve
for
the
hanging
of
those
detestable
judges
who
purchased
favor
at
court
at
the
price
of
the
people
s
misery
nor
was
this
all
on
the
eleventh
the
queen
in
going
to
mass
at
notre
dame
as
she
always
did
on
saturdays
was
followed
by
more
than
two
hundred
women
demanding
justice
these
poor
creatures
had
no
bad
intentions
they
wished
only
to
be
allowed
to
fall
on
their
knees
before
their
sovereign
and
that
they
might
move
her
to
compassion
but
they
were
prevented
by
the
royal
guard
and
the
queen
proceeded
on
her
way
haughtily
disdainful
of
their
entreaties
at
length
parliament
was
convoked
the
authority
of
the
king
was
to
be
maintained
one
day
it
was
the
morning
of
the
day
my
story
begins
the
king
louis
then
ten
years
of
age
went
in
state
under
pretext
of
returning
thanks
for
his
recovery
from
the
to
notre
dame
he
took
the
opportunity
of
calling
out
his
guard
the
swiss
troops
and
the
musketeers
and
he
had
planted
them
round
the
palais
royal
on
the
quays
and
on
the
pont
neuf
after
mass
the
young
monarch
drove
to
the
parliament
house
where
upon
the
throne
he
hastily
confirmed
not
only
such
edicts
as
he
had
already
passed
but
issued
new
ones
each
one
according
to
cardinal
de
retz
more
ruinous
than
the
others
a
proceeding
which
drew
forth
a
strong
remonstrance
from
the
chief
president
mole
whilst
president
blancmesnil
and
councillor
broussel
raised
their
voices
in
indignation
against
fresh
taxes
the
king
returned
amidst
the
silence
of
a
vast
multitude
to
the
palais
royal
all
minds
were
uneasy
most
were
foreboding
many
of
the
people
used
threatening
language
at
first
indeed
they
were
doubtful
whether
the
king
s
visit
to
the
parliament
had
been
in
order
to
lighten
or
increase
their
burdens
but
scarcely
was
it
known
that
the
taxes
were
to
be
still
further
increased
when
cries
of
down
with
mazarin
long
live
broussel
long
live
blancmesnil
resounded
through
the
city
for
the
people
had
learned
that
broussel
and
blancmesnil
had
made
speeches
in
their
behalf
and
although
the
eloquence
of
these
deputies
had
been
without
avail
it
had
none
the
less
won
for
them
the
people
s
all
attempts
to
disperse
the
groups
collected
in
the
streets
or
silence
their
exclamations
were
in
vain
orders
had
just
been
given
to
the
royal
guards
and
the
swiss
guards
not
only
to
stand
firm
but
to
send
out
patrols
to
the
streets
of
saint
denis
and
saint
martin
where
the
people
thronged
and
where
they
were
the
most
vociferous
when
the
mayor
of
paris
was
announced
at
the
palais
royal
he
was
shown
in
directly
he
came
to
say
that
if
these
offensive
precautions
were
not
discontinued
in
two
hours
paris
would
be
under
arms
deliberations
were
being
held
when
a
lieutenant
in
the
guards
named
comminges
made
his
appearance
with
his
clothes
all
torn
his
face
streaming
with
blood
the
queen
on
seeing
him
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
asked
him
what
was
going
on
as
the
mayor
had
foreseen
the
sight
of
the
guards
had
exasperated
the
mob
the
tocsin
was
sounded
comminges
had
arrested
one
of
the
ringleaders
and
had
ordered
him
to
be
hanged
near
the
cross
of
du
trahoir
but
in
attempting
to
execute
this
command
the
soldiery
were
attacked
in
the
with
stones
and
halberds
the
delinquent
had
escaped
to
the
rue
des
lombards
and
rushed
into
a
house
they
broke
open
the
doors
and
searched
the
dwelling
but
in
vain
comminges
wounded
by
a
stone
which
had
struck
him
on
the
forehead
had
left
a
picket
in
the
street
and
returned
to
the
palais
royal
followed
by
a
menacing
crowd
to
tell
his
story
this
account
confirmed
that
of
the
mayor
the
authorities
were
not
in
a
condition
to
cope
with
serious
revolt
mazarin
endeavored
to
circulate
among
the
people
a
report
that
troops
had
only
been
stationed
on
the
quays
and
on
the
pont
neuf
on
account
of
the
ceremonial
of
the
day
and
that
they
would
soon
withdraw
in
fact
about
four
o
clock
they
were
all
concentrated
about
the
palais
royal
the
courts
and
ground
floors
of
which
were
filled
with
musketeers
and
swiss
guards
and
there
awaited
the
outcome
of
all
this
disturbance
such
was
the
state
of
affairs
at
the
very
moment
we
introduced
our
readers
to
the
study
of
cardinal
mazarin
once
that
of
cardinal
richelieu
we
have
seen
in
what
state
of
mind
he
listened
to
the
murmurs
from
below
which
even
reached
him
in
his
seclusion
and
to
the
guns
the
firing
of
which
resounded
through
that
room
all
at
once
he
raised
his
head
his
brow
slightly
contracted
like
that
of
a
man
who
has
formed
a
resolution
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
an
enormous
clock
that
was
about
to
strike
ten
and
taking
up
a
whistle
of
silver
gilt
that
stood
upon
the
table
near
him
he
shrilled
it
twice
a
door
hidden
in
the
tapestry
opened
noiselessly
and
a
man
in
black
silently
advanced
and
stood
behind
the
chair
on
which
mazarin
sat
bernouin
said
the
cardinal
not
turning
round
for
having
whistled
he
knew
that
it
was
his
who
was
behind
him
what
musketeers
are
now
within
the
palace
the
black
musketeers
my
what
company
treville
s
is
there
any
officer
belonging
to
this
company
in
the
lieutenant
d
a
man
on
whom
we
can
depend
i
yes
my
give
me
a
uniform
of
one
of
these
musketeers
and
help
me
to
put
it
the
valet
went
out
as
silently
as
he
had
entered
and
appeared
in
a
few
minutes
bringing
the
dress
demanded
the
cardinal
in
deep
thought
and
in
silence
began
to
take
off
the
robes
of
state
he
had
assumed
in
order
to
be
present
at
the
sitting
of
parliament
and
to
attire
himself
in
the
military
coat
which
he
wore
with
a
certain
degree
of
easy
grace
owing
to
his
former
campaigns
in
italy
when
he
was
completely
dressed
he
said
send
hither
monsieur
d
the
valet
went
out
of
the
room
this
time
by
the
centre
door
but
still
as
silently
as
before
one
might
have
fancied
him
an
apparition
when
he
was
left
alone
the
cardinal
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
with
a
feeling
of
still
young
for
he
was
scarcely
years
of
age
he
possessed
great
elegance
of
form
and
was
above
the
middle
height
his
complexion
was
brilliant
and
beautiful
his
glance
full
of
expression
his
nose
though
large
was
well
proportioned
his
forehead
broad
and
majestic
his
hair
of
a
chestnut
color
was
curled
slightly
his
beard
which
was
darker
than
his
hair
was
turned
carefully
with
a
curling
iron
a
practice
that
greatly
improved
it
after
a
short
time
the
cardinal
arranged
his
shoulder
belt
then
looked
with
great
complacency
at
his
hands
which
were
most
elegant
and
of
which
he
took
the
greatest
care
and
throwing
on
one
side
the
large
kid
gloves
tried
on
at
first
as
belonging
to
the
uniform
he
put
on
others
of
silk
only
at
this
instant
the
door
opened
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
an
officer
as
he
spoke
entered
the
apartment
he
was
a
man
between
and
forty
years
of
age
of
medium
height
but
a
very
well
proportioned
figure
with
an
intellectual
and
animated
physiognomy
his
beard
black
and
his
hair
turning
gray
as
often
happens
when
people
have
found
life
either
too
gay
or
too
sad
more
especially
when
they
happen
to
be
of
swart
complexion
d
artagnan
advanced
a
few
steps
into
the
apartment
how
perfectly
he
remembered
his
former
entrance
into
that
very
room
seeing
however
no
one
there
except
a
musketeer
of
his
own
troop
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
supposed
soldier
in
whose
dress
nevertheless
he
recognized
at
the
first
glance
the
cardinal
the
lieutenant
remained
standing
in
a
dignified
but
respectful
posture
such
as
became
a
man
of
good
birth
who
had
in
the
course
of
his
life
been
frequently
in
the
society
of
the
highest
nobles
the
cardinal
looked
at
him
with
a
cunning
rather
than
serious
glance
yet
he
examined
his
countenance
with
attention
and
after
a
momentary
silence
said
you
are
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
am
that
individual
replied
the
officer
mazarin
gazed
once
more
at
a
countenance
full
of
intelligence
the
play
of
which
had
been
nevertheless
subdued
by
age
and
experience
and
d
artagnan
received
the
penetrating
glance
like
one
who
had
formerly
sustained
many
a
searching
look
very
different
indeed
from
those
which
were
inquiringly
directed
on
him
at
that
instant
sir
resumed
the
cardinal
you
are
to
come
with
me
or
rather
i
am
to
go
with
i
am
at
your
command
my
lord
returned
d
artagnan
i
wish
to
visit
in
person
the
outposts
which
surround
the
palais
royal
do
you
suppose
that
there
is
any
danger
in
so
doing
danger
my
lord
exclaimed
d
artagnan
with
a
look
of
astonishment
what
danger
i
am
told
that
there
is
a
general
the
uniform
of
the
king
s
musketeers
carries
a
certain
respect
with
it
and
even
if
that
were
not
the
case
i
would
engage
with
four
of
my
men
to
put
to
flight
a
hundred
of
these
did
you
witness
the
injury
sustained
by
comminges
monsieur
de
comminges
is
in
the
guards
and
not
in
the
musketeers
which
means
i
suppose
that
the
musketeers
are
better
soldiers
than
the
the
cardinal
smiled
as
he
spoke
every
one
likes
his
own
uniform
best
my
myself
excepted
and
again
mazarin
smiled
for
you
perceive
that
i
have
left
off
mine
and
put
on
lord
bless
us
this
is
modesty
indeed
cried
d
artagnan
had
i
such
a
uniform
as
your
eminence
possesses
i
protest
i
should
be
mightily
content
and
i
would
take
an
oath
never
to
wear
any
other
costume
yes
but
for
s
adventure
i
don
t
suppose
my
dress
would
have
been
a
very
safe
one
give
me
my
felt
hat
the
valet
instantly
brought
to
his
master
a
regimental
hat
with
a
wide
brim
the
cardinal
put
it
on
in
military
style
your
horses
are
ready
saddled
in
their
stables
are
they
not
he
said
turning
to
d
artagnan
yes
my
well
let
us
set
how
many
men
does
your
eminence
wish
to
escort
you
you
say
that
with
four
men
you
will
undertake
to
disperse
a
hundred
low
fellows
as
it
may
happen
that
we
shall
have
to
encounter
two
hundred
take
eight
as
many
as
my
lord
i
will
follow
you
this
way
light
us
downstairs
the
valet
held
a
the
cardinal
took
a
key
from
his
bureau
and
opening
the
door
of
a
secret
stair
descended
into
the
court
of
the
palais
royal
a
nightly
patrol
in
ten
minutes
mazarin
and
his
party
were
traversing
the
street
les
bons
enfants
behind
the
theatre
built
by
richelieu
expressly
for
the
play
of
mirame
and
in
which
mazarin
who
was
an
amateur
of
music
but
not
of
literature
had
introduced
into
france
the
first
opera
that
was
ever
acted
in
that
country
the
appearance
of
the
town
denoted
the
greatest
agitation
numberless
groups
paraded
the
streets
and
whatever
d
artagnan
might
think
of
it
it
was
obvious
that
the
citizens
had
for
the
night
laid
aside
their
usual
forbearance
in
order
to
assume
a
warlike
aspect
from
time
to
time
noises
came
in
the
direction
of
the
public
markets
the
report
of
firearms
was
heard
near
the
rue
saint
denis
and
occasionally
church
bells
began
to
ring
indiscriminately
and
at
the
caprice
of
the
populace
d
artagnan
meantime
pursued
his
way
with
the
indifference
of
a
man
upon
whom
such
acts
of
folly
made
no
impression
when
he
approached
a
group
in
the
middle
of
the
street
he
urged
his
horse
upon
it
without
a
word
of
warning
and
the
members
of
the
group
whether
rebels
or
not
as
if
they
knew
with
what
sort
of
a
man
they
had
to
deal
at
once
gave
place
to
the
patrol
the
cardinal
envied
that
composure
which
he
attributed
to
the
habit
of
meeting
danger
but
none
the
less
he
conceived
for
the
officer
under
whose
orders
he
had
for
the
moment
placed
himself
that
consideration
which
even
prudence
pays
to
careless
courage
on
approaching
an
outpost
near
the
barriere
des
sergens
the
sentinel
cried
out
who
s
there
and
d
artagnan
answered
having
first
asked
the
word
of
the
cardinal
louis
and
after
which
he
inquired
if
lieutenant
comminges
were
not
the
commanding
officer
at
the
outpost
the
soldier
replied
by
pointing
out
to
him
an
officer
who
was
conversing
on
foot
his
hand
upon
the
neck
of
a
horse
on
which
the
individual
to
whom
he
was
talking
sat
here
was
the
officer
d
artagnan
was
seeking
here
is
monsieur
comminges
said
d
artagnan
returning
to
the
cardinal
he
instantly
retired
from
a
feeling
of
respectful
delicacy
it
was
however
evident
that
the
cardinal
was
recognized
by
both
comminges
and
the
other
officers
on
horseback
well
done
guitant
cried
the
cardinal
to
the
equestrian
i
see
plainly
that
notwithstanding
the
years
that
have
passed
over
your
head
you
are
still
the
same
man
active
and
zealous
what
were
you
saying
to
this
youngster
my
lord
replied
guitant
i
was
observing
that
we
live
in
troublous
times
and
that
s
events
are
very
like
those
in
the
days
of
the
ligue
of
which
i
heard
so
much
in
my
youth
are
you
aware
that
the
mob
have
even
suggested
throwing
up
barricades
in
the
rue
saint
denis
and
the
rue
saint
antoine
and
what
was
comminges
saying
to
you
in
reply
my
good
guitant
my
lord
said
comminges
i
answered
that
to
compose
a
ligue
only
one
ingredient
was
wanting
in
my
opinion
an
essential
one
a
duc
de
guise
moreover
no
generation
ever
does
the
same
thing
no
but
they
mean
to
make
a
fronde
as
they
call
it
said
guitant
and
what
is
a
fronde
inquired
mazarin
my
lord
fronde
is
the
name
the
discontented
give
to
their
and
what
is
the
origin
of
this
name
it
seems
that
some
days
since
councillor
bachaumont
remarked
at
the
palace
that
rebels
and
agitators
reminded
him
of
schoolboys
slinging
qui
frondent
stones
from
the
moats
round
paris
young
urchins
who
run
off
the
moment
the
constable
appears
only
to
return
to
their
diversion
the
instant
his
back
is
turned
so
they
have
picked
up
the
word
and
the
insurrectionists
are
called
frondeurs
and
yesterday
every
article
sold
was
a
la
fronde
bread
a
la
fronde
hats
a
la
fronde
to
say
nothing
of
gloves
and
fans
but
listen
at
that
moment
a
window
opened
and
a
man
began
to
sing
a
tempest
from
the
fronde
did
blow
i
think
twill
blow
sieur
mazarin
insolent
wretch
cried
guitant
my
lord
said
comminges
who
irritated
by
his
wounds
wished
for
revenge
and
longed
to
give
back
blow
for
blow
shall
i
fire
off
a
ball
to
punish
that
jester
and
to
warn
him
not
to
sing
so
much
out
of
tune
in
the
future
and
as
he
spoke
he
put
his
hand
on
the
holster
of
his
uncle
s
certainly
not
certainly
not
exclaimed
mazarin
diavolo
my
dear
friend
you
are
going
to
spoil
everything
everything
is
going
on
famously
i
know
the
french
as
well
as
if
i
had
made
them
myself
they
sing
let
them
pay
the
piper
during
the
ligue
about
which
guitant
was
speaking
just
now
the
people
chanted
nothing
except
the
mass
so
everything
went
to
destruction
come
guitant
come
along
and
let
s
see
if
they
keep
watch
at
the
as
at
the
barriere
des
and
waving
his
hand
to
comminges
he
rejoined
d
artagnan
who
instantly
put
himself
at
the
head
of
his
troop
followed
by
the
cardinal
guitant
and
the
rest
of
the
escort
just
so
muttered
comminges
looking
after
mazarin
true
i
forgot
provided
he
can
get
money
out
of
the
people
that
is
all
he
the
street
of
saint
honore
when
the
cardinal
and
his
party
passed
through
it
was
crowded
by
an
assemblage
who
standing
in
groups
discussed
the
edicts
of
that
memorable
day
they
pitied
the
young
king
who
was
unconsciously
ruining
his
country
and
threw
all
the
odium
of
his
proceedings
on
mazarin
addresses
to
the
duke
of
orleans
and
to
conde
were
suggested
blancmesnil
and
broussel
seemed
in
the
highest
favor
d
artagnan
passed
through
the
very
midst
of
this
discontented
mob
just
as
if
his
horse
and
he
had
been
made
of
iron
mazarin
and
guitant
conversed
together
in
whispers
the
musketeers
who
had
already
discovered
who
mazarin
was
followed
in
profound
silence
in
the
street
of
saint
they
stopped
at
the
barrier
distinguished
by
the
name
of
here
guitant
spoke
to
one
of
the
subalterns
asking
how
matters
were
progressing
ah
captain
said
the
officer
everything
is
quiet
hereabout
if
i
did
not
know
that
something
is
going
on
in
yonder
house
and
he
pointed
to
a
magnificent
hotel
situated
on
the
very
spot
whereon
the
vaudeville
now
stands
in
that
hotel
it
is
the
hotel
rambouillet
cried
guitant
i
really
don
t
know
what
hotel
it
is
all
i
do
know
is
that
i
observed
some
suspicious
looking
people
go
in
there
nonsense
exclaimed
guitant
with
a
burst
of
laughter
those
men
must
be
come
guitant
speak
if
you
please
respectfully
of
these
gentlemen
said
mazarin
don
t
you
know
that
i
was
in
my
youth
a
poet
i
wrote
verses
in
the
style
of
benserade
you
my
lord
yes
i
shall
i
repeat
to
you
some
of
my
verses
just
as
you
please
my
lord
i
do
not
understand
yes
but
you
understand
french
and
mazarin
laid
his
hand
upon
guitant
s
shoulder
my
good
my
brave
guitant
whatsoever
command
i
may
give
you
in
that
language
in
french
whatever
i
may
order
you
to
do
will
you
not
perform
it
certainly
i
have
already
answered
that
question
in
the
affirmative
but
that
command
must
come
from
the
queen
yes
ah
yes
mazarin
bit
his
lips
as
he
spoke
i
know
your
devotion
to
her
i
have
been
a
captain
in
the
queen
s
guards
for
twenty
years
was
the
reply
en
route
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
cardinal
all
goes
well
in
this
d
artagnan
in
the
meantime
had
taken
the
head
of
his
detachment
without
a
word
and
with
that
ready
and
profound
obedience
which
marks
the
character
of
an
old
soldier
he
led
the
way
toward
the
hill
of
saint
roche
the
rue
richelieu
and
the
rue
villedot
were
then
owing
to
their
vicinity
to
the
ramparts
less
frequented
than
any
others
in
that
direction
for
the
town
was
thinly
inhabited
thereabout
who
is
in
command
here
asked
the
cardinal
villequier
said
guitant
diavolo
speak
to
him
yourself
for
ever
since
you
were
deputed
by
me
to
arrest
the
duc
de
beaufort
this
officer
and
i
have
been
on
bad
terms
he
laid
claim
to
that
honor
as
captain
of
the
royal
i
am
aware
of
that
and
i
have
told
him
a
hundred
times
that
he
was
wrong
the
king
could
not
give
that
order
since
at
that
time
he
was
hardly
four
years
yes
but
i
could
give
him
the
order
i
guitant
and
i
preferred
to
give
it
to
guitant
without
reply
rode
forward
and
desired
the
sentinel
to
call
monsieur
de
villequier
ah
so
you
are
here
cried
the
officer
in
the
tone
of
habitual
to
him
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
i
wish
to
know
can
you
tell
me
pray
is
anything
fresh
occurring
in
this
part
of
the
town
what
do
you
mean
people
cry
out
long
live
the
king
down
with
mazarin
that
s
nothing
new
no
we
ve
been
used
to
those
acclamations
for
some
and
you
sing
chorus
replied
guitant
laughing
faith
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
do
it
in
my
opinion
the
people
are
right
and
cheerfully
would
i
give
up
five
years
of
my
pay
which
i
am
never
paid
by
the
way
to
make
the
king
five
years
really
and
pray
what
would
come
to
pass
supposing
the
king
were
five
years
older
than
he
is
as
soon
as
ever
the
king
comes
of
age
he
will
issue
his
commands
himself
and
tis
far
pleasanter
to
obey
the
grandson
of
henry
iv
than
the
son
of
peter
mazarin
sdeath
i
would
die
willingly
for
the
king
but
supposing
i
happened
to
be
killed
on
account
of
mazarin
as
your
nephew
came
near
being
there
could
be
nothing
in
paradise
however
well
placed
i
might
be
there
that
could
console
me
for
well
well
monsieur
de
villequier
mazarin
interposed
i
shall
make
it
my
care
the
king
hears
of
your
loyalty
come
gentlemen
addressing
the
troop
let
us
stop
exclaimed
villequier
so
mazarin
was
here
so
much
the
better
i
have
been
waiting
for
a
long
time
to
tell
him
what
i
think
of
him
i
am
obliged
to
you
guitant
although
your
intention
was
perhaps
not
very
favorable
to
me
for
such
an
he
turned
away
and
went
off
to
his
post
whistling
a
tune
then
popular
among
the
party
called
the
fronde
whilst
mazarin
returned
in
a
pensive
mood
toward
the
palais
royal
all
that
he
had
heard
from
these
three
different
men
comminges
guitant
and
villequier
confirmed
him
in
his
conviction
that
in
case
of
serious
tumults
there
would
be
no
one
on
his
side
except
the
queen
and
then
anne
of
austria
had
so
often
deserted
her
friends
that
her
support
seemed
most
precarious
during
the
whole
of
this
nocturnal
ride
during
the
whole
time
that
he
was
endeavoring
to
understand
the
various
characters
of
comminges
guitant
and
villequier
mazarin
was
in
truth
studying
more
especially
one
man
this
man
who
had
remained
immovable
as
bronze
when
menaced
by
the
mob
not
a
muscle
of
whose
face
was
stirred
either
at
mazarin
s
witticisms
or
by
the
jests
of
the
multitude
seemed
to
the
cardinal
a
peculiar
being
who
having
participated
in
past
events
similar
to
those
now
occurring
was
calculated
to
cope
with
those
now
on
the
eve
of
taking
place
the
name
of
d
artagnan
was
not
altogether
new
to
mazarin
who
although
he
did
not
arrive
in
france
before
the
year
or
that
is
to
say
about
eight
or
nine
years
after
the
events
which
we
have
related
in
a
preceding
narrative
fancied
he
had
heard
it
pronounced
as
that
of
one
who
was
said
to
be
a
model
of
courage
address
and
loyalty
the
three
possessed
by
this
idea
the
cardinal
resolved
to
know
all
about
d
artagnan
immediately
of
course
he
could
not
inquire
from
d
artagnan
himself
who
he
was
and
what
had
been
his
career
he
remarked
however
in
the
course
of
conversation
that
the
lieutenant
of
musketeers
spoke
with
a
gascon
accent
now
the
italians
and
the
gascons
are
too
much
alike
and
know
each
other
too
well
ever
to
trust
what
any
one
of
them
may
say
of
himself
so
in
reaching
the
walls
which
surrounded
the
palais
royal
the
cardinal
knocked
at
a
little
door
and
after
thanking
d
artagnan
and
requesting
him
to
wait
in
the
court
of
the
palais
royal
he
made
a
sign
to
guitant
to
follow
him
they
both
dismounted
consigned
their
horses
to
the
lackey
who
had
opened
the
door
and
disappeared
in
the
garden
my
dear
friend
said
the
cardinal
leaning
as
they
walked
through
the
garden
on
his
friend
s
arm
you
told
me
just
now
that
you
had
been
twenty
years
in
the
queen
s
yes
it
s
true
i
have
returned
guitant
now
my
dear
guitant
i
have
often
remarked
that
in
addition
to
your
courage
which
is
indisputable
and
your
fidelity
which
is
invincible
you
possess
an
admirable
you
have
found
that
out
have
you
my
lord
deuce
take
it
all
the
worse
for
me
how
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
one
of
the
chief
accomplishments
of
a
courtier
is
to
know
when
to
but
you
guitant
are
not
a
courtier
you
are
a
brave
soldier
one
of
the
few
remaining
veterans
of
the
days
of
henry
iv
alas
how
few
exist
plague
on
t
my
lord
have
you
brought
me
here
to
get
my
horoscope
out
of
me
no
i
only
brought
you
here
to
ask
you
returned
mazarin
smiling
if
you
have
taken
any
particular
notice
of
our
lieutenant
of
musketeers
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
have
had
no
occasion
to
notice
him
particularly
he
s
an
old
acquaintance
he
s
a
gascon
de
treville
knows
him
and
esteems
him
very
highly
and
de
treville
as
you
know
is
one
of
the
queen
s
greatest
friends
as
a
soldier
the
man
ranks
well
he
did
his
whole
duty
and
even
more
at
the
siege
of
rochelle
as
at
suze
and
but
you
know
guitant
we
poor
ministers
often
want
men
with
other
qualities
besides
courage
we
want
men
of
talent
pray
was
not
monsieur
d
artagnan
in
the
time
of
the
cardinal
mixed
up
in
some
intrigue
from
which
he
came
out
according
to
report
quite
cleverly
my
lord
as
to
the
report
you
allude
to
guitant
perceived
that
the
cardinal
wished
to
make
him
speak
out
i
know
nothing
but
what
the
public
knows
i
never
meddle
in
intrigues
and
if
i
occasionally
become
a
confidant
of
the
intrigues
of
others
i
am
sure
your
eminence
will
approve
of
my
keeping
them
mazarin
shook
his
head
ah
he
said
some
ministers
are
fortunate
and
find
out
all
that
they
wish
to
my
lord
replied
guitant
such
ministers
do
not
weigh
men
in
the
same
balance
they
get
their
information
on
war
from
warriors
on
intrigues
from
intriguers
consult
some
politician
of
the
period
of
which
you
speak
and
if
you
pay
well
for
it
you
will
certainly
get
to
know
all
you
eh
pardieu
said
mazarin
with
a
grimace
which
he
always
made
when
spoken
to
about
money
they
will
be
paid
if
there
is
no
way
of
getting
out
of
does
my
lord
seriously
wish
me
to
name
any
one
who
was
mixed
up
in
the
cabals
of
that
day
by
bacchus
rejoined
mazarin
impatiently
it
s
about
an
hour
since
i
asked
you
for
that
very
thing
that
you
there
is
one
man
for
whom
i
can
answer
if
he
will
speak
that
s
my
concern
i
will
make
him
ah
my
lord
tis
not
easy
to
make
people
say
what
they
don
t
wish
to
let
pooh
with
patience
one
must
succeed
well
this
man
who
is
he
the
comte
de
the
comte
de
rochefort
unfortunately
he
has
disappeared
these
four
or
five
years
and
i
don
t
know
where
he
i
know
guitant
said
mazarin
well
then
how
is
it
that
your
eminence
complained
just
now
of
want
of
information
you
think
resumed
mazarin
that
rochefort
he
was
cardinal
richelieu
s
creature
my
lord
i
warn
you
however
his
services
will
cost
you
something
the
cardinal
was
lavish
to
his
yes
yes
guitant
said
mazarin
richelieu
was
a
great
man
a
very
great
man
but
he
had
that
defect
thanks
guitant
i
shall
benefit
by
your
advice
this
very
here
they
separated
and
bidding
adieu
to
guitant
in
the
court
of
the
palais
royal
mazarin
approached
an
officer
who
was
walking
up
and
down
within
that
inclosure
it
was
d
artagnan
who
was
waiting
for
him
come
hither
said
mazarin
in
his
softest
voice
i
have
an
order
to
give
d
artagnan
bent
low
and
following
the
cardinal
up
the
secret
staircase
soon
found
himself
in
the
study
whence
they
had
first
set
out
the
cardinal
seated
himself
before
his
bureau
and
taking
a
sheet
of
paper
wrote
some
lines
upon
it
whilst
d
artagnan
stood
imperturbable
without
showing
either
impatience
or
curiosity
he
was
like
a
soldierly
automaton
or
rather
like
a
magnificent
marionette
the
cardinal
folded
and
sealed
his
letter
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
said
you
are
to
take
this
dispatch
to
the
bastile
and
bring
back
here
the
person
it
concerns
you
must
take
a
carriage
and
an
escort
and
guard
the
prisoner
with
the
greatest
d
artagnan
took
the
letter
touched
his
hat
with
his
hand
turned
round
upon
his
heel
like
a
and
a
moment
afterward
was
heard
in
his
dry
and
monotonous
tone
commanding
four
men
and
an
escort
a
carriage
and
a
five
minutes
afterward
the
wheels
of
the
carriage
and
the
horses
shoes
were
heard
resounding
on
the
pavement
of
the
courtyard
dead
animosities
d
artagnan
arrived
at
the
bastile
just
as
it
was
striking
eight
his
visit
was
announced
to
the
governor
who
on
hearing
that
he
came
from
the
cardinal
went
to
meet
him
and
received
him
at
the
top
of
the
great
flight
of
steps
outside
the
door
the
governor
of
the
bastile
was
monsieur
du
tremblay
the
brother
of
the
famous
capuchin
joseph
that
fearful
favorite
of
richelieu
s
who
went
by
the
name
of
the
gray
cardinal
during
the
period
that
the
duc
de
bassompierre
passed
in
the
bastile
where
he
remained
for
twelve
long
years
when
his
companions
in
their
dreams
of
liberty
said
to
each
other
as
for
me
i
shall
go
out
of
the
prison
at
such
a
time
and
another
at
such
and
such
a
time
the
duke
used
to
answer
as
for
me
gentlemen
i
shall
leave
only
when
monsieur
du
tremblay
leaves
meaning
that
at
the
death
of
the
cardinal
du
tremblay
would
certainly
lose
his
place
at
the
bastile
and
de
bassompierre
regain
his
at
court
his
prediction
was
nearly
fulfilled
but
in
a
very
different
way
from
that
which
de
bassompierre
supposed
for
after
the
death
of
richelieu
everything
went
on
contrary
to
expectation
in
the
same
way
as
before
and
bassompierre
had
little
chance
of
leaving
his
prison
monsieur
du
tremblay
received
d
artagnan
with
extreme
politeness
and
invited
him
to
sit
down
with
him
to
supper
of
which
he
was
himself
about
to
partake
i
should
be
delighted
to
do
so
was
the
reply
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
the
words
in
haste
are
written
on
the
envelope
of
the
letter
which
i
you
are
right
said
du
tremblay
halloo
major
tell
them
to
order
number
to
come
the
unhappy
wretch
who
entered
the
bastile
ceased
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
to
be
a
man
he
became
a
number
d
artagnan
shuddered
at
the
noise
of
the
keys
he
remained
on
horseback
feeling
no
inclination
to
dismount
and
sat
looking
at
the
bars
at
the
buttressed
windows
and
the
immense
walls
he
had
hitherto
only
seen
from
the
other
side
of
the
moat
but
by
which
he
had
for
twenty
years
been
a
bell
resounded
i
must
leave
you
said
du
tremblay
i
am
sent
for
to
sign
the
release
of
a
prisoner
i
shall
be
happy
to
meet
you
again
may
the
devil
annihilate
me
if
i
return
thy
wish
murmured
d
artagnan
smiling
as
he
pronounced
the
imprecation
i
declare
i
feel
quite
ill
after
only
being
five
minutes
in
the
courtyard
go
to
go
to
i
would
rather
die
on
straw
than
hoard
up
a
thousand
a
year
by
being
governor
of
the
he
had
scarcely
finished
this
soliloquy
before
the
prisoner
arrived
on
seeing
him
d
artagnan
could
hardly
suppress
an
exclamation
of
surprise
the
prisoner
got
into
the
carriage
without
seeming
to
recognize
the
musketeer
gentlemen
thus
d
artagnan
addressed
the
four
musketeers
i
am
ordered
to
exercise
the
greatest
possible
care
in
guarding
the
prisoner
and
since
there
are
no
locks
to
the
carriage
i
shall
sit
beside
him
monsieur
de
lillebonne
lead
my
horse
by
the
bridle
if
you
as
he
spoke
he
dismounted
gave
the
bridle
of
his
horse
to
the
musketeer
and
placing
himself
by
the
side
of
the
prisoner
said
in
a
voice
perfectly
composed
to
the
palais
royal
at
full
the
carriage
drove
on
and
d
artagnan
availing
himself
of
the
darkness
in
the
archway
under
which
they
were
passing
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
prisoner
rochefort
he
exclaimed
you
is
it
you
indeed
i
am
not
mistaken
d
artagnan
cried
rochefort
ah
my
poor
friend
resumed
d
artagnan
not
having
seen
you
for
four
or
five
years
i
concluded
you
were
i
faith
said
rochefort
there
s
no
great
difference
i
think
between
a
dead
man
and
one
who
has
been
buried
alive
now
i
have
been
buried
alive
or
very
nearly
and
for
what
crime
are
you
imprisoned
in
the
do
you
wish
me
to
speak
the
truth
well
then
i
don
t
have
you
any
suspicion
of
me
rochefort
no
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
but
i
can
not
be
imprisoned
for
the
reason
alleged
it
is
what
reason
asked
d
artagnan
for
for
stealing
you
rochefort
you
are
laughing
at
i
understand
you
mean
that
this
demands
explanation
do
you
not
i
admit
well
this
is
what
actually
took
place
one
evening
after
an
orgy
in
reinard
s
apartment
at
the
tuileries
with
the
duc
d
harcourt
fontrailles
de
rieux
and
others
the
duc
d
harcourt
proposed
that
we
should
go
and
pull
cloaks
on
the
pont
neuf
that
is
you
know
a
diversion
which
the
duc
d
orleans
made
quite
the
were
you
crazy
rochefort
at
your
age
no
i
was
drunk
and
yet
since
the
amusement
seemed
to
me
rather
tame
i
proposed
to
chevalier
de
rieux
that
we
should
be
spectators
instead
of
actors
and
in
order
to
see
to
advantage
that
we
should
mount
the
bronze
horse
no
sooner
said
than
done
thanks
to
the
spurs
which
served
as
stirrups
in
a
moment
we
were
perched
upon
the
croupe
we
were
well
placed
and
saw
everything
four
or
five
cloaks
had
already
been
lifted
with
a
dexterity
without
parallel
and
not
one
of
the
victims
had
dared
to
say
a
word
when
some
fool
of
a
fellow
less
patient
than
the
others
took
it
into
his
head
to
cry
out
guard
and
drew
upon
us
a
patrol
of
archers
duc
d
harcourt
fontrailles
and
the
others
escaped
de
rieux
was
inclined
to
do
likewise
but
i
told
him
they
wouldn
t
look
for
us
where
we
were
he
wouldn
t
listen
put
his
foot
on
the
spur
to
get
down
the
spur
broke
he
fell
with
a
broken
leg
and
instead
of
keeping
quiet
took
to
crying
out
like
a
i
then
was
ready
to
dismount
but
it
was
too
late
i
descended
into
the
arms
of
the
archers
they
conducted
me
to
the
chatelet
where
i
slept
soundly
being
very
sure
that
on
the
next
day
i
should
go
forth
free
the
next
day
came
and
passed
the
day
after
a
week
i
then
wrote
to
the
cardinal
the
same
day
they
came
for
me
and
took
me
to
the
bastile
that
was
five
years
ago
do
you
believe
it
was
because
i
committed
the
sacrilege
of
mounting
en
croupe
behind
henry
iv
no
you
are
right
my
dear
rochefort
it
couldn
t
be
for
that
but
you
will
probably
learn
the
reason
ah
indeed
i
forgot
to
ask
you
where
are
you
taking
me
to
the
what
does
he
want
with
me
i
do
not
know
i
did
not
even
know
that
you
were
the
person
i
was
sent
to
impossible
you
a
favorite
of
the
minister
a
favorite
no
indeed
cried
d
artagnan
ah
my
poor
friend
i
am
just
as
poor
a
gascon
as
when
i
saw
you
at
meung
years
ago
you
know
alas
and
he
concluded
his
speech
with
a
deep
sigh
nevertheless
you
come
as
one
in
because
i
happened
to
be
in
the
when
the
cardinal
called
me
by
the
merest
chance
i
am
still
a
lieutenant
in
the
musketeers
and
have
been
so
these
twenty
then
no
misfortune
has
happened
to
you
and
what
misfortune
could
happen
to
me
to
quote
some
latin
verses
i
have
forgotten
or
rather
never
knew
well
the
thunderbolt
never
falls
on
the
valleys
and
i
am
a
valley
dear
rochefort
one
of
the
lowliest
of
the
then
mazarin
is
still
mazarin
the
same
as
ever
my
friend
it
is
said
that
he
is
married
to
the
married
if
not
her
husband
he
is
unquestionably
her
you
surprise
me
rebuff
buckingham
and
consent
to
mazarin
just
like
the
women
replied
d
artagnan
coolly
like
women
not
like
egad
queens
are
the
weakest
of
their
sex
when
it
comes
to
such
things
as
and
de
beaufort
is
he
still
in
prison
yes
why
oh
nothing
but
that
he
might
get
me
out
of
this
if
he
were
favorably
inclined
to
you
are
probably
nearer
freedom
than
he
is
so
it
will
be
your
business
to
get
him
and
said
the
prisoner
what
talk
is
there
of
war
with
spain
with
spain
no
answered
d
artagnan
but
what
do
you
mean
cried
rochefort
do
you
hear
the
guns
pray
the
citizens
are
amusing
themselves
in
the
and
you
do
you
really
think
that
anything
could
be
done
with
these
bourgeois
yes
they
might
do
well
if
they
had
any
leader
to
unite
them
in
one
how
miserable
not
to
be
free
don
t
be
downcast
since
mazarin
has
sent
for
you
it
is
because
he
wants
you
i
congratulate
you
many
a
long
year
has
passed
since
any
one
has
wanted
to
employ
me
so
you
see
in
what
a
situation
i
make
your
complaints
known
that
s
my
listen
rochefort
let
us
make
a
compact
we
are
friends
are
we
not
egad
i
bear
the
traces
of
our
friendship
three
slits
or
slashes
from
your
well
if
you
should
be
restored
to
favor
don
t
forget
on
the
honor
of
a
rochefort
but
you
must
do
the
like
for
there
s
my
hand
i
therefore
whenever
you
find
any
opportunity
of
saying
something
in
my
behalf
i
shall
say
it
and
you
i
shall
do
the
apropos
are
we
to
speak
of
your
friends
also
athos
porthos
and
aramis
or
have
you
forgotten
them
what
has
become
of
them
i
don
t
know
we
separated
as
you
know
they
are
alive
that
s
all
that
i
can
say
about
them
from
time
to
time
i
hear
of
them
indirectly
but
in
what
part
of
the
world
they
are
devil
take
me
if
i
know
no
on
my
honor
i
have
not
a
friend
in
the
world
but
you
and
the
illustrious
what
s
the
name
of
the
lad
whom
i
made
a
sergeant
in
piedmont
s
regiment
planchet
the
illustrious
planchet
what
has
become
of
him
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
were
at
the
head
of
the
mob
at
this
very
moment
he
married
a
woman
who
keeps
a
confectioner
s
shop
in
the
rue
des
lombards
for
he
s
a
lad
who
was
always
fond
of
sweetmeats
he
s
now
a
citizen
of
paris
you
ll
see
that
that
queer
fellow
will
be
a
sheriff
before
i
shall
be
a
come
dear
d
artagnan
look
up
a
little
courage
it
is
when
one
is
lowest
on
the
wheel
of
fortune
that
the
wheels
and
rewards
us
this
evening
your
destiny
begins
to
amen
exclaimed
d
artagnan
stopping
the
carriage
what
are
you
doing
asked
rochefort
we
are
almost
there
and
i
want
no
one
to
see
me
getting
out
of
your
carriage
we
are
supposed
not
to
know
each
you
are
right
au
revoir
remember
your
in
five
minutes
the
party
entered
the
courtyard
and
d
artagnan
led
the
prisoner
up
the
great
staircase
and
across
the
corridor
and
as
they
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
cardinal
s
study
d
artagnan
was
about
to
be
announced
when
rochefort
slapped
him
on
his
shoulder
d
artagnan
let
me
confess
to
you
what
i
ve
been
thinking
about
during
the
whole
of
my
drive
as
i
looked
out
upon
the
parties
of
citizens
who
perpetually
crossed
our
path
and
looked
at
you
and
your
four
men
with
fiery
speak
out
answered
d
artagnan
i
had
only
to
cry
out
help
for
you
and
for
your
companions
to
be
cut
to
pieces
and
then
i
should
have
been
why
didn
t
you
do
it
asked
the
lieutenant
come
come
cried
rochefort
did
we
not
swear
friendship
ah
had
any
one
but
you
been
there
i
don
t
say
d
artagnan
bowed
is
it
possible
that
rochefort
has
become
a
better
man
than
i
am
he
said
to
himself
and
he
caused
himself
to
be
announced
to
the
minister
let
de
rochefort
enter
said
mazarin
eagerly
on
hearing
their
names
pronounced
and
beg
d
artagnan
to
wait
i
shall
have
further
need
of
these
words
gave
great
joy
to
d
artagnan
as
he
had
said
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
any
one
had
needed
him
and
that
demand
for
his
services
on
the
part
of
mazarin
seemed
to
him
an
auspicious
sign
rochefort
rendered
suspicious
and
cautious
by
these
words
entered
the
apartment
where
he
found
mazarin
sitting
at
the
table
dressed
in
his
ordinary
garb
and
as
one
of
the
prelates
of
the
church
his
costume
being
similar
to
that
of
the
abbes
in
that
day
excepting
that
his
scarf
and
stockings
were
violet
as
the
door
was
closed
rochefort
cast
a
glance
toward
mazarin
which
was
answered
by
one
equally
furtive
from
the
minister
there
was
little
change
in
the
cardinal
still
dressed
with
sedulous
care
his
hair
well
arranged
and
curled
his
person
perfumed
he
looked
owing
to
his
extreme
taste
in
dress
only
half
his
age
but
rochefort
who
had
passed
five
years
in
prison
had
become
old
in
the
lapse
of
a
few
years
the
dark
locks
of
this
estimable
friend
of
the
defunct
cardinal
richelieu
were
now
white
the
deep
bronze
of
his
complexion
had
been
succeeded
by
a
mortal
pallor
which
betokened
debility
as
he
gazed
at
him
mazarin
shook
his
head
slightly
as
much
as
to
say
this
is
a
man
who
does
not
appear
to
me
fit
for
after
a
pause
which
appeared
an
age
to
rochefort
mazarin
took
from
a
bundle
of
papers
a
letter
and
showing
it
to
the
count
he
said
i
find
here
a
letter
in
which
you
sue
for
liberty
monsieur
de
rochefort
you
are
in
prison
then
rochefort
trembled
in
every
limb
at
this
question
but
i
thought
he
said
that
your
eminence
knew
that
circumstance
better
than
any
one
i
oh
no
there
is
a
congestion
of
prisoners
in
the
bastile
who
were
cooped
up
in
the
time
of
monsieur
de
richelieu
i
don
t
even
know
their
yes
but
in
regard
to
myself
my
lord
it
can
not
be
so
for
i
was
removed
from
the
chatelet
to
the
bastile
owing
to
an
order
from
your
you
think
you
i
am
certain
of
ah
stay
i
fancy
i
remember
it
did
you
not
once
refuse
to
undertake
a
journey
to
brussels
for
the
queen
ah
ah
exclaimed
rochefort
there
is
the
true
reason
idiot
that
i
am
though
i
have
been
trying
to
find
it
out
for
five
years
i
never
found
it
but
i
do
not
say
it
was
the
cause
of
your
imprisonment
i
merely
ask
you
did
you
not
refuse
to
go
to
brussels
for
the
queen
whilst
you
had
consented
to
go
there
to
do
some
service
for
the
late
cardinal
that
is
the
very
reason
i
refused
to
go
back
to
brussels
i
was
there
at
a
fearful
moment
i
was
sent
there
to
intercept
a
correspondence
between
chalais
and
the
archduke
and
even
then
when
i
was
discovered
i
was
nearly
torn
to
pieces
how
could
i
then
return
to
brussels
i
should
injure
the
queen
instead
of
serving
well
since
the
best
motives
are
liable
to
misconstruction
the
queen
saw
in
your
refusal
nothing
but
a
refusal
a
distinct
refusal
she
had
also
much
to
complain
of
you
during
the
lifetime
of
the
late
cardinal
yes
her
majesty
the
queen
rochefort
smiled
contemptuously
since
i
was
a
faithful
servant
my
lord
to
cardinal
richelieu
during
his
life
it
stands
to
reason
that
now
after
his
death
i
should
serve
you
well
in
defiance
of
the
whole
with
regard
to
myself
monsieur
de
rochefort
replied
mazarin
i
am
not
like
monsieur
de
richelieu
i
am
but
a
minister
who
wants
no
servants
being
myself
nothing
but
a
servant
of
the
queen
s
now
the
queen
is
of
a
sensitive
nature
hearing
of
your
refusal
to
obey
her
she
looked
upon
it
as
a
declaration
of
war
and
as
she
considers
you
a
man
of
superior
talent
and
consequently
dangerous
she
desired
me
to
make
sure
of
you
that
is
the
reason
of
your
being
shut
up
in
the
bastile
but
your
release
can
be
managed
you
are
one
of
those
men
who
can
comprehend
certain
matters
and
having
understood
them
can
act
with
energy
such
was
cardinal
richelieu
s
opinion
my
the
cardinal
interrupted
mazarin
was
a
great
politician
and
therein
shone
his
vast
superiority
over
me
i
am
a
straightforward
simple
man
that
s
my
great
disadvantage
i
am
of
a
frankness
of
character
quite
rochefort
bit
his
lips
in
order
to
prevent
a
smile
now
to
the
point
i
want
friends
i
want
faithful
servants
when
i
say
i
want
i
mean
the
queen
wants
them
i
do
nothing
without
her
commands
pray
understand
that
not
like
monsieur
de
richelieu
who
went
on
just
as
he
pleased
so
i
shall
never
be
a
great
man
as
he
was
but
to
compensate
for
that
i
shall
be
a
good
man
monsieur
de
rochefort
and
i
hope
to
prove
it
to
rochefort
knew
well
the
tones
of
that
soft
voice
in
which
sounded
sometimes
a
sort
of
gentle
lisp
like
the
hissing
of
young
vipers
i
am
disposed
to
believe
your
eminence
he
replied
though
i
have
had
but
little
evidence
of
that
of
which
your
eminence
speaks
do
not
forget
that
i
have
been
five
years
in
the
bastile
and
that
no
medium
of
viewing
things
is
so
deceptive
as
the
grating
of
a
ah
monsieur
de
rochefort
have
i
not
told
you
already
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
the
queen
can
not
you
make
allowances
for
the
pettishness
of
a
queen
and
a
princess
but
that
has
passed
away
as
suddenly
as
it
came
and
is
i
can
easily
suppose
sir
that
her
majesty
has
forgotten
it
amid
the
fetes
and
the
courtiers
of
the
palais
royal
but
i
who
have
passed
those
years
in
the
bastile
ah
mon
dieu
my
dear
monsieur
de
rochefort
do
you
absolutely
think
that
the
palais
royal
is
the
abode
of
gayety
no
we
have
had
great
annoyances
there
as
for
me
i
play
my
game
squarely
fairly
and
above
board
as
i
always
do
let
us
come
to
some
conclusion
are
you
one
of
us
monsieur
de
rochefort
i
am
very
desirous
of
being
so
my
lord
but
i
am
totally
in
the
dark
about
everything
in
the
bastile
one
talks
politics
only
with
soldiers
and
jailers
and
you
have
not
an
idea
my
lord
how
little
is
known
of
what
is
going
on
by
people
of
that
sort
i
am
of
monsieur
de
bassompierre
s
party
is
he
still
one
of
the
seventeen
peers
of
france
he
is
dead
sir
a
great
loss
his
devotion
to
the
queen
was
boundless
men
of
loyalty
are
i
think
so
forsooth
said
rochefort
and
when
you
find
any
of
them
you
march
them
off
to
the
bastile
however
there
are
plenty
in
the
world
but
you
don
t
look
in
the
right
direction
for
them
my
indeed
explain
to
me
ah
my
dear
monsieur
de
rochefort
how
much
you
must
have
learned
during
your
intimacy
with
the
late
cardinal
ah
he
was
a
great
will
your
eminence
be
angry
if
i
read
you
a
lesson
i
never
you
know
you
may
say
anything
to
me
i
try
to
be
beloved
not
well
there
is
on
the
wall
of
my
cell
scratched
with
a
nail
a
proverb
which
says
like
master
like
pray
what
does
that
mean
it
means
that
monsieur
de
richelieu
was
able
to
find
trusty
servants
dozens
and
dozens
of
he
the
point
aimed
at
by
every
poniard
richelieu
who
passed
his
life
in
warding
off
blows
which
were
forever
aimed
at
him
but
he
did
ward
them
off
said
de
rochefort
and
the
reason
was
that
though
he
had
bitter
enemies
he
possessed
also
true
friends
i
have
known
persons
he
continued
for
he
thought
he
might
avail
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
speaking
of
d
artagnan
who
by
their
sagacity
and
address
have
deceived
the
penetration
of
cardinal
richelieu
who
by
their
valor
have
got
the
better
of
his
guards
and
spies
persons
without
money
without
support
without
credit
yet
who
have
preserved
to
the
crowned
head
its
crown
and
made
the
cardinal
crave
but
those
men
you
speak
of
said
mazarin
smiling
inwardly
on
seeing
rochefort
approach
the
point
to
which
he
was
leading
him
those
men
were
not
devoted
to
the
cardinal
for
they
contended
against
no
in
that
case
they
would
have
met
with
more
fitting
reward
they
had
the
misfortune
to
be
devoted
to
that
very
queen
for
whom
just
now
you
were
seeking
but
how
is
it
that
you
know
so
much
of
these
matters
i
know
them
because
the
men
of
whom
i
speak
were
at
that
time
my
enemies
because
they
fought
against
me
because
i
did
them
all
the
harm
i
could
and
they
returned
it
to
the
best
of
their
ability
because
one
of
them
with
whom
i
had
most
to
do
gave
me
a
pretty
now
about
seven
years
ago
the
third
that
i
received
from
the
same
hand
it
closed
an
old
ah
said
mazarin
with
admirable
suavity
could
i
but
find
such
men
my
lord
there
has
stood
for
six
years
at
your
very
door
a
man
such
as
i
describe
and
during
those
six
years
he
has
been
unappreciated
and
unemployed
by
who
is
it
it
is
monsieur
d
that
gascon
cried
mazarin
with
well
acted
surprise
that
gascon
has
saved
a
queen
and
made
monsieur
de
richelieu
confess
that
in
point
of
talent
address
and
political
skill
to
him
he
was
only
a
really
it
is
as
i
have
the
honor
of
telling
it
to
your
tell
me
a
little
about
it
my
dear
monsieur
de
that
is
somewhat
difficult
my
lord
said
rochefort
with
a
smile
then
he
will
tell
it
me
i
doubt
it
my
why
do
you
doubt
it
because
the
secret
does
not
belong
to
him
because
as
i
have
told
you
it
has
to
do
with
a
great
and
he
was
alone
in
achieving
an
enterprise
like
that
no
my
lord
he
had
three
colleagues
three
brave
men
men
such
as
you
were
wishing
for
just
and
were
these
four
men
attached
to
each
other
true
in
heart
really
united
as
if
they
had
been
one
man
as
if
their
four
hearts
had
pulsated
in
one
you
pique
my
curiosity
dear
rochefort
pray
tell
me
the
whole
that
is
impossible
but
i
will
tell
you
a
true
story
my
pray
do
so
i
delight
in
stories
cried
the
cardinal
listen
then
returned
rochefort
as
he
spoke
endeavoring
to
read
in
that
subtle
countenance
the
cardinal
s
motive
once
upon
a
time
there
lived
a
queen
a
powerful
monarch
who
reigned
over
one
of
the
greatest
kingdoms
of
the
universe
and
a
minister
and
this
minister
wished
much
to
injure
the
queen
whom
once
he
had
loved
too
well
do
not
try
my
lord
you
can
not
guess
who
it
is
all
this
happened
long
before
you
came
into
the
country
where
this
queen
reigned
there
came
to
the
court
an
ambassador
so
brave
so
magnificent
so
elegant
that
every
woman
lost
her
heart
to
him
and
the
queen
had
even
the
indiscretion
to
give
him
certain
ornaments
so
rare
that
they
could
never
be
replaced
by
any
like
them
as
these
ornaments
were
given
by
the
king
the
minister
persuaded
his
majesty
to
insist
upon
the
queen
s
appearing
in
them
as
part
of
her
jewels
at
a
ball
which
was
soon
to
take
place
there
is
no
occasion
to
tell
you
my
lord
that
the
minister
knew
for
a
fact
that
these
ornaments
had
sailed
away
with
the
ambassador
who
was
far
away
beyond
seas
this
illustrious
queen
had
fallen
low
as
the
least
of
her
subjects
fallen
from
her
high
indeed
well
my
lord
four
men
resolved
to
save
her
these
four
men
were
not
princes
neither
were
they
dukes
neither
were
they
men
in
power
they
were
not
even
rich
they
were
four
honest
soldiers
each
with
a
good
heart
a
good
arm
and
a
sword
at
the
service
of
those
who
wanted
it
they
set
out
the
minister
knew
of
their
departure
and
had
planted
people
on
the
road
to
prevent
them
ever
reaching
their
destination
three
of
them
were
overwhelmed
and
disabled
by
numerous
assailants
one
of
them
alone
arrived
at
the
port
having
either
killed
or
wounded
those
who
wished
to
stop
him
he
crossed
the
sea
and
brought
back
the
set
of
ornaments
to
the
great
queen
who
was
able
to
wear
them
on
her
shoulder
on
the
appointed
day
and
this
very
nearly
ruined
the
minister
what
do
you
think
of
that
exploit
my
lord
it
is
magnificent
said
mazarin
thoughtfully
well
i
know
of
ten
such
mazarin
made
no
reply
he
reflected
five
or
six
minutes
elapsed
you
have
nothing
more
to
ask
of
me
my
lord
said
rochefort
yes
and
you
say
that
monsieur
d
artagnan
was
one
of
those
four
men
he
led
the
and
who
were
the
others
i
leave
it
to
monsieur
d
artagnan
to
name
them
my
lord
they
were
his
friends
and
not
mine
he
alone
would
have
any
influence
with
them
i
do
not
even
know
them
under
their
true
you
suspect
me
monsieur
de
rochefort
i
want
him
and
you
and
all
to
aid
begin
with
me
my
lord
for
after
five
or
six
years
of
imprisonment
it
is
natural
to
feel
some
curiosity
as
to
one
s
you
my
dear
monsieur
de
rochefort
shall
have
the
post
of
confidence
you
shall
go
to
vincennes
where
monsieur
de
beaufort
is
confined
you
will
guard
him
well
for
me
well
what
is
the
matter
the
matter
is
that
you
have
proposed
to
me
what
is
impossible
said
rochefort
shaking
his
head
with
an
air
of
disappointment
what
impossible
and
why
is
it
impossible
because
monsieur
de
beaufort
is
one
of
my
friends
or
rather
i
am
one
of
his
have
you
forgotten
my
lord
that
it
is
he
who
answered
for
me
to
the
queen
since
then
monsieur
de
beaufort
has
become
an
enemy
of
the
that
may
be
my
lord
but
since
i
am
neither
king
nor
queen
nor
minister
he
is
not
my
enemy
and
i
can
not
accept
your
this
then
is
what
you
call
devotion
i
congratulate
you
your
devotion
does
not
commit
you
too
far
monsieur
de
and
then
my
lord
continued
rochefort
you
understand
that
to
emerge
from
the
bastile
in
order
to
enter
vincennes
is
only
to
change
one
s
say
at
once
that
you
are
on
the
side
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
that
will
be
the
most
sincere
line
of
conduct
said
mazarin
my
lord
i
have
been
so
long
shut
up
that
i
am
only
of
one
party
i
am
for
fresh
air
employ
me
in
any
other
way
employ
me
even
actively
but
let
it
be
on
the
high
my
dear
monsieur
de
rochefort
mazarin
replied
in
a
tone
of
raillery
you
think
yourself
still
a
young
man
your
spirit
is
that
of
the
phoenix
but
your
strength
fails
you
believe
me
you
ought
now
to
take
a
rest
here
you
decide
then
nothing
about
me
my
lord
on
the
contrary
i
have
come
to
a
bernouin
came
into
the
room
call
an
officer
of
justice
he
said
and
stay
close
to
me
he
added
in
a
low
tone
the
officer
entered
mazarin
wrote
a
few
words
which
he
gave
to
this
man
then
he
bowed
adieu
monsieur
de
rochefort
he
said
rochefort
bent
low
i
see
my
lord
i
am
to
be
taken
back
to
the
you
are
i
shall
return
thither
my
lord
but
it
is
a
mistake
on
your
part
not
to
employ
you
the
friend
of
my
greatest
foes
don
t
suppose
that
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
serve
me
monsieur
de
rochefort
i
shall
find
many
men
as
able
as
you
i
wish
you
may
my
lord
replied
de
rochefort
he
was
then
reconducted
by
the
little
staircase
instead
of
passing
through
the
where
d
artagnan
was
waiting
in
the
courtyard
the
carriage
and
the
four
musketeers
were
ready
but
he
looked
around
in
vain
for
his
friend
ah
he
muttered
to
himself
this
changes
the
situation
and
if
there
is
still
a
crowd
of
people
in
the
streets
we
will
try
to
show
mazarin
that
we
are
still
thank
god
good
for
something
else
than
keeping
guard
over
a
prisoner
and
he
jumped
into
the
carriage
with
the
alacrity
of
a
man
of
anne
of
austria
at
the
age
of
when
left
alone
with
bernouin
mazarin
was
for
some
minutes
lost
in
thought
he
had
gained
much
information
but
not
enough
mazarin
was
a
cheat
at
the
this
is
a
detail
preserved
to
us
by
brienne
he
called
it
using
his
advantages
he
now
determined
not
to
begin
the
game
with
d
artagnan
till
he
knew
completely
all
his
adversary
s
cards
my
lord
have
you
any
commands
asked
bernouin
yes
yes
replied
mazarin
light
me
i
am
going
to
the
bernouin
took
up
a
candlestick
and
led
the
way
there
was
a
secret
communication
between
the
cardinal
s
apartments
and
those
of
the
queen
and
through
this
mazarin
passed
whenever
he
wished
to
visit
anne
of
austria
secret
passage
is
still
to
be
seen
in
the
palais
in
the
bedroom
in
which
this
passage
ended
bernouin
encountered
madame
de
beauvais
like
himself
intrusted
with
the
secret
of
these
subterranean
love
affairs
and
madame
de
beauvais
undertook
to
prepare
anne
of
austria
who
was
in
her
oratory
with
the
young
king
louis
to
receive
the
cardinal
anne
reclining
in
a
large
her
head
supported
by
her
hand
her
elbow
resting
on
a
table
was
looking
at
her
son
who
was
turning
over
the
leaves
of
a
large
book
filled
with
pictures
this
celebrated
woman
fully
understood
the
art
of
being
dull
with
dignity
it
was
her
practice
to
pass
hours
either
in
her
oratory
or
in
her
room
without
either
reading
or
praying
when
madame
de
beauvais
appeared
at
the
door
and
announced
the
cardinal
the
child
who
had
been
absorbed
in
the
pages
of
quintus
curtius
enlivened
as
they
were
by
engravings
of
alexander
s
feats
of
arms
frowned
and
looked
at
his
mother
why
he
said
does
he
enter
without
first
asking
for
an
audience
anne
colored
slightly
the
prime
minister
she
said
is
obliged
in
these
unsettled
days
to
inform
the
queen
of
all
that
is
happening
from
time
to
time
without
exciting
the
curiosity
or
remarks
of
the
but
richelieu
never
came
in
this
manner
said
the
pertinacious
boy
how
can
you
remember
what
monsieur
de
richelieu
did
you
were
too
young
to
know
about
such
i
do
not
remember
what
he
did
but
i
have
inquired
and
i
have
been
told
all
about
and
who
told
you
about
it
asked
anne
of
austria
with
a
movement
of
impatience
i
know
that
i
ought
never
to
name
the
persons
who
answer
my
questions
answered
the
child
for
if
i
do
i
shall
learn
nothing
at
this
very
moment
mazarin
entered
the
king
rose
immediately
took
his
book
closed
it
and
went
to
lay
it
down
on
the
table
near
which
he
continued
standing
in
order
that
mazarin
might
be
obliged
to
stand
also
mazarin
contemplated
these
proceedings
with
a
thoughtful
glance
they
explained
what
had
occurred
that
evening
he
bowed
respectfully
to
the
king
who
gave
him
a
somewhat
cavalier
reception
but
a
look
from
his
mother
reproved
him
for
the
hatred
which
from
his
infancy
louis
xiv
had
entertained
toward
mazarin
and
he
endeavored
to
receive
the
minister
s
homage
with
civility
anne
of
austria
sought
to
read
in
mazarin
s
face
the
occasion
of
this
unexpected
visit
since
the
cardinal
usually
came
to
her
apartment
only
after
every
one
had
retired
the
minister
made
a
slight
sign
with
his
head
whereupon
the
queen
said
to
madame
beauvais
it
is
time
for
the
king
to
go
to
bed
call
the
queen
had
several
times
already
told
her
son
that
he
ought
to
go
to
bed
and
several
times
louis
had
coaxingly
insisted
on
staying
where
he
was
but
now
he
made
no
reply
but
turned
pale
and
bit
his
lips
with
anger
in
a
few
minutes
laporte
came
into
the
room
the
child
went
directly
to
him
without
kissing
his
mother
well
louis
said
anne
why
do
you
not
kiss
me
i
thought
you
were
angry
with
me
madame
you
sent
me
i
do
not
send
you
away
but
you
have
had
the
and
i
am
afraid
that
sitting
up
late
may
tire
you
had
no
fears
of
my
being
tired
when
you
ordered
me
to
go
to
the
palace
to
pass
the
odious
decrees
which
have
raised
the
people
to
sire
interposed
laporte
in
order
to
turn
the
subject
to
whom
does
your
majesty
wish
me
to
give
the
candle
to
any
one
laporte
the
child
said
and
then
added
in
a
loud
voice
to
any
one
except
now
mancini
was
a
nephew
of
mazarin
s
and
was
as
much
hated
by
louis
as
the
cardinal
himself
although
placed
near
his
person
by
the
minister
and
the
king
went
out
of
the
room
without
either
embracing
his
mother
or
even
bowing
to
the
cardinal
good
said
mazarin
i
am
glad
to
see
that
his
majesty
has
been
brought
up
with
a
hatred
of
why
do
you
say
that
asked
the
queen
almost
timidly
why
it
seems
to
me
that
the
way
in
which
he
left
us
needs
no
explanation
besides
his
majesty
takes
no
pains
to
conceal
how
little
affection
he
has
for
me
that
however
does
not
hinder
me
from
being
entirely
devoted
to
his
service
as
i
am
to
that
of
your
i
ask
your
pardon
for
him
cardinal
said
the
queen
he
is
a
child
not
yet
able
to
understand
his
obligations
to
the
cardinal
smiled
but
continued
the
queen
you
have
doubtless
come
for
some
important
purpose
what
is
it
then
mazarin
sank
into
a
chair
with
the
deepest
melancholy
painted
on
his
countenance
it
is
likely
he
replied
that
we
shall
soon
be
obliged
to
separate
unless
you
love
me
well
enough
to
follow
me
to
why
cried
the
queen
how
is
that
because
as
they
say
in
the
opera
of
thisbe
the
whole
world
conspires
to
break
our
you
jest
sir
answered
the
queen
endeavoring
to
assume
something
of
her
former
dignity
alas
i
do
not
madame
rejoined
mazarin
mark
well
what
i
say
the
whole
world
conspires
to
break
our
bonds
now
as
you
are
one
of
the
whole
world
i
mean
to
say
that
you
also
are
deserting
cardinal
heavens
did
i
not
see
you
the
other
day
smile
on
the
duke
of
orleans
or
rather
at
what
he
said
and
what
was
he
saying
he
said
this
madame
mazarin
is
a
send
him
away
and
all
will
then
be
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
oh
madame
you
are
the
queen
queen
forsooth
when
i
am
at
the
mercy
of
every
scribbler
in
the
palais
royal
who
covers
waste
paper
with
nonsense
or
of
every
country
squire
in
the
nevertheless
you
have
still
the
power
of
banishing
from
your
presence
those
whom
you
do
not
like
that
is
to
say
whom
you
do
not
like
returned
the
queen
i
persons
whom
i
do
not
like
yes
indeed
who
sent
away
madame
de
chevreuse
after
she
had
been
persecuted
twelve
years
under
the
last
reign
a
woman
of
intrigue
who
wanted
to
keep
up
against
me
the
spirit
of
cabal
she
had
raised
against
de
who
dismissed
madame
de
hautefort
that
friend
so
loyal
that
she
refused
the
favor
of
the
king
that
she
might
remain
in
mine
a
prude
who
told
you
every
night
as
she
undressed
you
that
it
was
a
sin
to
love
a
priest
just
as
if
one
were
a
priest
because
one
happens
to
be
a
who
ordered
monsieur
de
beaufort
to
be
arrested
an
incendiary
the
burden
of
whose
song
was
his
intention
to
assassinate
you
see
cardinal
replied
the
queen
that
your
enemies
are
that
is
not
enough
madame
it
is
necessary
that
your
friends
should
be
also
my
friends
monsieur
the
queen
shook
her
head
alas
i
have
them
no
longer
how
is
it
that
you
have
no
friends
in
your
prosperity
when
you
had
many
in
adversity
it
is
because
in
my
prosperity
i
forgot
those
old
friends
monsieur
because
i
have
acted
like
queen
marie
de
medicis
who
returning
from
her
first
exile
treated
with
contempt
all
those
who
had
suffered
for
her
and
being
proscribed
a
second
time
died
at
cologne
abandoned
by
every
one
even
by
her
own
well
let
us
see
said
mazarin
isn
t
there
still
time
to
repair
the
evil
search
among
your
friends
your
oldest
what
do
you
mean
monsieur
nothing
else
than
i
say
alas
i
look
around
me
in
vain
i
have
no
influence
with
any
one
monsieur
is
as
usual
led
by
his
favorite
yesterday
it
was
choisy
it
is
la
riviere
it
will
be
some
one
else
monsieur
le
prince
is
led
by
the
coadjutor
who
is
led
by
madame
de
therefore
madame
i
ask
you
to
look
not
among
your
friends
of
but
among
those
of
other
among
my
friends
of
other
times
said
the
queen
yes
among
your
friends
of
other
times
among
those
who
aided
you
to
contend
against
the
duc
de
richelieu
and
even
to
conquer
what
is
he
aiming
at
murmured
the
queen
looking
uneasily
at
the
cardinal
yes
continued
his
eminence
under
certain
circumstances
with
that
strong
and
shrewd
mind
your
majesty
possesses
aided
by
your
friends
you
were
able
to
repel
the
attacks
of
that
i
said
the
queen
i
suffered
that
is
yes
said
mazarin
as
women
suffer
in
avenging
themselves
come
let
us
come
to
the
point
do
you
know
monsieur
de
rochefort
one
of
my
bitterest
enemies
the
faithful
friend
of
cardinal
i
know
that
and
we
sent
him
to
the
bastile
said
mazarin
is
he
at
liberty
asked
the
queen
no
still
there
but
i
only
speak
of
him
in
order
that
i
may
introduce
the
name
of
another
man
do
you
know
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
added
looking
steadfastly
at
the
queen
anne
of
austria
received
the
blow
with
a
beating
heart
has
the
gascon
been
indiscreet
she
murmured
to
herself
then
said
aloud
d
artagnan
stop
an
instant
the
name
seems
certainly
familiar
d
artagnan
there
was
a
musketeer
who
was
in
love
with
one
of
my
women
poor
young
creature
she
was
poisoned
on
my
that
s
all
you
know
of
him
asked
mazarin
the
queen
looked
at
him
surprised
you
seem
sir
she
remarked
to
be
making
me
undergo
a
course
of
which
you
answer
according
to
your
fancy
replied
mazarin
tell
me
your
wishes
and
i
will
comply
with
the
queen
spoke
with
some
impatience
well
madame
said
mazarin
bowing
i
desire
that
you
give
me
a
share
in
your
friends
as
i
have
shared
with
you
the
little
industry
and
talent
that
heaven
has
given
me
the
circumstances
are
grave
and
it
will
be
necessary
to
act
still
said
the
queen
i
thought
that
we
were
finally
quit
of
monsieur
de
yes
you
saw
only
the
torrent
that
threatened
to
overturn
everything
and
you
gave
no
attention
to
the
still
water
there
is
however
a
proverb
current
in
france
relating
to
water
which
is
continue
said
the
queen
well
then
madame
not
a
day
passes
in
which
i
do
not
suffer
affronts
from
your
princes
and
your
lordly
servants
all
of
them
automata
who
do
not
perceive
that
i
wind
up
the
spring
that
makes
them
move
nor
do
they
see
that
beneath
my
quiet
demeanor
lies
the
still
scorn
of
an
injured
irritated
man
who
has
sworn
to
himself
to
master
them
one
of
these
days
we
have
arrested
monsieur
de
beaufort
but
he
is
the
least
dangerous
among
them
there
is
the
prince
de
conde
the
hero
of
rocroy
do
you
think
of
him
yes
madame
often
and
often
but
pazienza
as
we
say
in
italy
next
after
monsieur
de
conde
comes
the
duke
of
what
are
you
saying
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
the
king
s
uncle
no
not
the
first
prince
of
the
blood
not
the
king
s
uncle
but
the
base
conspirator
the
soul
of
every
cabal
who
pretends
to
lead
the
brave
people
who
are
weak
enough
to
believe
in
the
honor
of
a
prince
of
the
blood
not
the
prince
nearest
to
the
throne
not
the
king
s
uncle
i
repeat
but
the
murderer
of
chalais
of
montmorency
and
of
who
is
playing
now
the
same
game
he
played
long
ago
and
who
thinks
that
he
will
win
the
game
because
he
has
a
new
adversary
instead
of
a
man
who
threatened
a
man
who
smiles
but
he
is
mistaken
i
shall
not
leave
so
near
the
queen
that
source
of
discord
with
which
the
deceased
cardinal
so
often
caused
the
anger
of
the
king
to
rage
above
the
boiling
anne
blushed
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
what
am
i
to
do
she
said
bowed
down
beneath
the
voice
of
her
tyrant
endeavor
to
remember
the
names
of
those
faithful
servants
who
crossed
the
channel
in
spite
of
monsieur
de
richelieu
tracking
the
roads
along
which
they
passed
by
their
blood
to
bring
back
to
your
majesty
certain
jewels
given
by
you
to
anne
arose
full
of
majesty
and
as
if
touched
by
a
spring
and
looking
at
the
cardinal
with
the
haughty
dignity
which
in
the
days
of
her
youth
had
made
her
so
powerful
you
are
insulting
me
she
said
i
wish
continued
mazarin
finishing
as
it
were
the
speech
this
sudden
movement
of
the
queen
had
cut
i
wish
in
fact
that
you
should
now
do
for
your
husband
what
you
formerly
did
for
your
again
that
accusation
cried
the
queen
i
thought
that
calumny
was
stifled
or
extinct
you
have
spared
me
till
now
but
since
you
speak
of
it
once
for
all
i
tell
you
madame
i
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
said
mazarin
astounded
by
this
returning
courage
i
will
tell
you
all
replied
anne
listen
there
were
in
truth
at
that
epoch
four
devoted
hearts
four
loyal
spirits
four
faithful
swords
who
saved
more
than
my
life
my
honor
ah
you
confess
it
exclaimed
mazarin
is
it
only
the
guilty
whose
honor
is
at
the
sport
of
others
sir
and
can
not
women
be
dishonored
by
appearances
yes
appearances
were
against
me
and
i
was
about
to
suffer
dishonor
however
i
swear
i
was
not
guilty
i
swear
it
by
the
queen
looked
around
her
for
some
sacred
object
by
which
she
could
swear
and
taking
out
of
a
cupboard
hidden
in
the
tapestry
a
small
coffer
of
rosewood
set
in
silver
and
laying
it
on
the
altar
i
swear
she
said
by
these
sacred
relics
that
buckingham
was
not
my
what
relics
are
those
by
which
you
swear
asked
mazarin
smiling
i
am
the
queen
untied
from
around
her
throat
a
small
golden
key
which
hung
there
and
presented
it
to
the
cardinal
open
sir
she
said
and
look
for
mazarin
opened
the
coffer
a
knife
covered
with
rust
and
two
letters
one
of
which
was
stained
with
blood
alone
met
his
gaze
what
are
these
things
he
asked
what
are
these
things
replied
anne
with
dignity
extending
toward
the
open
coffer
an
arm
despite
the
lapse
of
years
still
beautiful
these
two
letters
are
the
only
ones
i
ever
wrote
to
him
this
knife
is
the
knife
with
which
felton
stabbed
him
read
the
letters
and
see
if
i
have
lied
or
spoken
the
but
mazarin
notwithstanding
this
permission
instead
of
reading
the
letters
took
the
knife
which
the
dying
buckingham
had
snatched
out
of
the
wound
and
sent
by
laporte
to
the
queen
the
blade
was
red
for
the
blood
had
become
rust
after
a
momentary
examination
during
which
the
queen
became
as
white
as
the
cloth
which
covered
the
altar
on
which
she
was
leaning
he
put
it
back
into
the
coffer
with
an
involuntary
shudder
it
is
well
madame
i
believe
your
no
no
read
exclaimed
the
queen
indignantly
read
i
command
you
for
i
am
resolved
that
everything
shall
be
finished
and
never
will
i
recur
to
this
subject
again
do
you
think
she
said
with
a
ghastly
smile
that
i
shall
be
inclined
to
reopen
this
coffer
to
answer
any
future
accusations
mazarin
overcome
by
this
determination
read
the
two
letters
in
one
the
queen
asked
for
the
ornaments
back
again
this
letter
had
been
conveyed
by
d
artagnan
and
had
arrived
in
time
the
other
was
that
which
laporte
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
warning
him
that
he
was
about
to
be
assassinated
that
communication
had
arrived
too
late
it
is
well
madame
said
mazarin
nothing
can
gainsay
such
sir
replied
the
queen
closing
the
coffer
and
leaning
her
hand
upon
it
if
there
is
anything
to
be
said
it
is
that
i
have
always
been
ungrateful
to
the
brave
men
who
saved
me
that
i
have
given
nothing
to
that
gallant
officer
d
artagnan
you
were
speaking
of
just
now
but
my
hand
to
kiss
and
this
as
she
spoke
she
extended
her
beautiful
hand
to
the
cardinal
and
showed
him
a
superb
diamond
which
sparkled
on
her
finger
it
appears
she
resumed
that
he
sold
it
sold
it
in
order
to
save
me
another
time
to
be
able
to
send
a
messenger
to
the
duke
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
he
sold
it
to
monsieur
des
essarts
on
whose
finger
i
remarked
it
i
bought
it
from
him
but
it
belongs
to
d
artagnan
give
it
back
to
him
sir
and
since
you
have
such
a
man
in
your
service
make
him
thank
you
madame
said
mazarin
i
will
profit
by
the
and
now
added
the
queen
her
voice
broken
by
her
emotion
have
you
any
other
question
to
ask
me
nothing
the
cardinal
spoke
in
his
most
conciliatory
manner
except
to
beg
of
you
to
forgive
my
unworthy
suspicions
i
love
you
so
tenderly
that
i
can
not
help
being
jealous
even
of
the
a
smile
which
was
indefinable
passed
over
the
lips
of
the
queen
since
you
have
no
further
interrogations
to
make
leave
me
i
beseech
you
she
said
i
wish
after
such
a
scene
to
be
mazarin
bent
low
before
her
i
will
retire
madame
do
you
permit
me
to
return
yes
the
cardinal
took
the
queen
s
hand
and
pressed
it
with
an
air
of
gallantry
to
his
lips
scarcely
had
he
left
her
when
the
queen
went
into
her
son
s
room
and
inquired
from
laporte
if
the
king
was
in
bed
laporte
pointed
to
the
child
who
was
asleep
anne
ascended
the
steps
side
of
the
bed
and
softly
kissed
the
placid
forehead
of
her
son
then
she
retired
as
silently
as
she
had
come
merely
saying
to
laporte
try
my
dear
laporte
to
make
the
king
more
courteous
to
monsieur
le
cardinal
to
whom
both
he
and
i
are
under
such
important
the
gascon
and
the
italian
meanwhile
the
cardinal
returned
to
his
own
room
and
after
asking
bernouin
who
stood
at
the
door
whether
anything
had
occurred
during
his
absence
and
being
answered
in
the
negative
he
desired
that
he
might
be
left
alone
when
he
was
alone
he
opened
the
door
of
the
corridor
and
then
that
of
the
there
d
artagnan
was
asleep
upon
a
bench
the
cardinal
went
up
to
him
and
touched
his
shoulder
d
artagnan
started
awakened
himself
and
as
he
awoke
stood
up
exactly
like
a
soldier
under
arms
here
i
am
said
he
who
calls
me
i
said
mazarin
with
his
most
smiling
expression
i
ask
pardon
of
your
eminence
said
d
artagnan
but
i
was
so
fatigued
don
t
ask
my
pardon
monsieur
said
mazarin
for
you
fatigued
yourself
in
my
d
artagnan
admired
mazarin
s
gracious
manner
ah
said
he
between
his
teeth
is
there
truth
in
the
proverb
that
fortune
comes
while
one
sleeps
follow
me
monsieur
said
mazarin
come
come
murmured
d
artagnan
rochefort
has
kept
his
promise
but
where
in
the
devil
is
he
and
he
searched
the
cabinet
even
to
the
smallest
recesses
but
there
was
no
sign
of
rochefort
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
cardinal
sitting
down
on
a
fauteuil
you
have
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
brave
and
honorable
possibly
thought
d
artagnan
but
he
has
taken
a
long
time
to
let
me
know
his
thoughts
nevertheless
he
bowed
to
the
very
ground
in
gratitude
for
mazarin
s
compliment
well
continued
mazarin
the
time
has
come
to
put
to
use
your
talents
and
your
there
was
a
sudden
gleam
of
joy
in
the
officer
s
eyes
which
vanished
immediately
for
he
knew
nothing
of
mazarin
s
purpose
order
my
lord
he
said
i
am
ready
to
obey
your
monsieur
d
artagnan
continued
the
cardinal
you
performed
sundry
superb
exploits
in
the
last
your
eminence
is
too
good
to
remember
such
trifles
in
my
favor
it
is
true
i
fought
with
tolerable
i
don
t
speak
of
your
warlike
exploits
monsieur
said
mazarin
although
they
gained
you
much
reputation
they
were
surpassed
by
d
artagnan
pretended
astonishment
well
you
do
not
reply
resumed
mazarin
i
am
waiting
my
lord
till
you
tell
me
of
what
exploits
you
i
speak
of
the
adventure
eh
you
know
well
what
i
alas
no
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
surprised
you
are
discreet
so
much
the
better
i
speak
of
that
adventure
in
behalf
of
the
queen
of
the
ornaments
of
the
journey
you
made
with
three
of
your
aha
thought
the
gascon
is
this
a
snare
or
not
let
me
be
on
my
and
he
assumed
a
look
of
stupidity
which
mendori
or
bellerose
two
of
the
first
actors
of
the
day
might
have
envied
bravo
cried
mazarin
they
told
me
that
you
were
the
man
i
wanted
come
let
us
see
what
you
will
do
for
everything
that
your
eminence
may
please
to
command
me
was
the
reply
you
will
do
for
me
what
you
have
done
for
the
queen
certainly
d
artagnan
said
to
himself
he
wishes
to
make
me
speak
out
he
s
not
more
cunning
than
de
richelieu
was
devil
take
him
then
he
said
aloud
the
queen
my
lord
i
don
t
you
don
t
comprehend
that
i
want
you
and
your
three
friends
to
be
of
use
to
me
which
of
my
friends
my
lord
your
three
friends
the
friends
of
former
of
former
days
my
lord
in
former
days
i
had
not
only
three
friends
i
had
thirty
at
one
calls
every
man
one
s
well
sir
returned
mazarin
prudence
is
a
fine
thing
but
you
might
regret
having
been
too
my
lord
pythagoras
made
his
disciples
keep
silence
for
five
years
that
they
might
learn
to
hold
their
but
you
have
been
silent
for
twenty
years
sir
speak
now
the
queen
herself
releases
you
from
your
the
queen
said
d
artagnan
with
an
astonishment
which
this
time
was
not
pretended
yes
the
queen
and
as
a
proof
of
what
i
say
she
commanded
me
to
show
you
this
diamond
which
she
thinks
you
and
so
saying
mazarin
extended
his
hand
to
the
officer
who
sighed
as
he
recognized
the
ring
so
gracefully
given
to
him
by
the
queen
on
the
night
of
the
ball
at
the
hotel
de
ville
and
which
she
had
repurchased
from
monsieur
des
essarts
tis
true
i
remember
well
that
diamond
which
belonged
to
the
you
see
then
that
i
speak
to
you
in
the
queen
s
name
answer
me
without
acting
as
if
you
were
on
the
stage
your
interests
are
concerned
in
your
so
faith
my
lord
it
is
very
necessary
for
me
to
make
my
fortune
your
eminence
has
so
long
forgotten
we
need
only
a
week
to
amend
all
that
come
you
are
accounted
for
you
are
here
but
where
are
your
friends
i
do
not
know
my
lord
we
have
parted
company
this
long
time
all
three
have
left
the
where
can
you
find
them
then
wherever
they
are
that
s
my
well
now
what
are
your
conditions
if
i
employ
you
money
my
lord
as
much
money
as
what
you
wish
me
to
undertake
will
require
i
remember
too
well
how
sometimes
we
were
stopped
for
want
of
money
and
but
for
that
diamond
which
i
was
obliged
to
sell
we
should
have
remained
on
the
the
devil
he
does
money
and
a
large
sum
said
mazarin
pray
are
you
aware
that
the
king
has
no
money
in
his
treasury
do
then
as
i
did
my
lord
sell
the
crown
diamonds
trust
me
don
t
let
us
try
to
do
things
cheaply
great
undertakings
come
poorly
off
with
paltry
well
returned
mazarin
we
will
satisfy
richelieu
thought
d
artagnan
would
have
given
me
five
hundred
pistoles
in
you
will
then
be
at
my
service
asked
mazarin
yes
if
my
friends
but
if
they
refuse
can
i
count
on
you
i
have
never
accomplished
anything
alone
said
d
artagnan
shaking
his
head
go
then
and
find
what
shall
i
say
to
them
by
way
of
inducement
to
serve
your
eminence
you
know
them
better
than
i
adapt
your
promises
to
their
respective
what
shall
i
promise
that
if
they
serve
me
as
well
as
they
served
the
queen
my
gratitude
shall
be
but
what
are
we
to
do
make
your
mind
easy
when
the
time
for
action
comes
you
shall
be
put
in
full
possession
of
what
i
require
from
you
wait
till
that
time
arrives
and
find
out
your
my
lord
perhaps
they
are
not
in
paris
it
is
even
probable
that
i
shall
have
to
make
a
journey
i
am
only
a
lieutenant
of
musketeers
very
poor
and
journeys
cost
money
my
intention
said
mazarin
is
not
that
you
go
with
a
great
following
my
plans
require
secrecy
and
would
be
jeopardized
by
a
too
extravagant
still
my
lord
i
can
t
travel
on
my
pay
for
it
is
now
three
months
behind
and
i
can
t
travel
on
my
savings
for
in
my
years
of
service
i
have
accumulated
nothing
but
mazarin
remained
some
moments
in
deep
thought
as
if
he
were
fighting
with
himself
then
going
to
a
large
cupboard
closed
with
a
triple
lock
he
took
from
it
a
bag
of
silver
and
weighing
it
twice
in
his
hands
before
he
gave
it
to
d
artagnan
take
this
he
said
with
a
sigh
tis
merely
for
your
if
these
are
spanish
doubloons
or
even
gold
crowns
thought
d
artagnan
we
shall
yet
be
able
to
do
business
he
saluted
the
cardinal
and
plunged
the
bag
into
the
depths
of
an
immense
pocket
well
then
all
is
settled
you
are
to
set
off
said
the
cardinal
yes
my
apropos
what
are
the
names
of
your
friends
the
count
de
la
fere
formerly
styled
athos
monsieur
du
vallon
whom
we
used
to
call
porthos
the
chevalier
d
herblay
now
the
abbe
d
herblay
whom
we
styled
aramis
the
cardinal
smiled
younger
sons
he
said
who
enlisted
in
the
musketeers
under
feigned
names
in
order
not
to
lower
their
family
names
long
swords
but
light
purses
was
that
it
if
god
willing
these
swords
should
be
devoted
to
the
service
of
your
eminence
said
d
artagnan
i
shall
venture
to
express
a
wish
which
is
that
in
its
turn
the
purse
of
your
eminence
may
become
light
and
theirs
heavy
for
with
these
three
men
your
eminence
may
rouse
all
europe
if
you
these
gascons
said
the
cardinal
laughing
almost
beat
the
italians
in
at
all
events
answered
d
artagnan
with
a
smile
almost
as
crafty
as
the
cardinal
s
they
beat
them
when
they
draw
their
he
then
withdrew
and
as
he
passed
into
the
courtyard
he
stopped
near
a
lamp
and
dived
eagerly
into
the
bag
of
money
crown
pieces
only
silver
pieces
i
suspected
it
ah
mazarin
mazarin
thou
hast
no
confidence
in
me
so
much
the
worse
for
thee
for
harm
may
come
of
it
meanwhile
the
cardinal
was
rubbing
his
hands
in
great
satisfaction
a
hundred
pistoles
a
hundred
pistoles
for
a
hundred
pistoles
i
have
discovered
a
secret
for
which
richelieu
would
have
paid
twenty
thousand
crowns
without
reckoning
the
value
of
that
diamond
he
cast
a
complacent
look
at
the
ring
which
he
had
kept
instead
of
restoring
to
d
artagnan
which
is
worth
at
least
ten
thousand
he
returned
to
his
room
and
after
depositing
the
ring
in
a
casket
filled
with
brilliants
of
every
sort
for
the
cardinal
was
a
connoisseur
in
precious
stones
he
called
to
bernouin
to
undress
him
regardless
of
the
noises
of
that
though
it
was
now
near
midnight
continued
to
resound
through
paris
in
the
meantime
d
artagnan
took
his
way
toward
the
rue
tiquetonne
where
he
lived
at
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
we
will
explain
in
a
few
words
how
d
artagnan
had
been
led
to
choose
that
place
of
residence
d
artagnan
in
his
fortieth
year
years
have
elapsed
many
events
have
happened
alas
since
in
our
romance
of
the
three
musketeers
we
took
leave
of
d
artagnan
at
no
rue
des
fossoyeurs
d
artagnan
had
not
failed
in
his
career
but
circumstances
had
been
adverse
to
him
so
long
as
he
was
surrounded
by
his
friends
he
retained
his
youth
and
the
poetry
of
his
character
he
was
one
of
those
fine
ingenuous
natures
which
assimilate
themselves
easily
to
the
dispositions
of
others
athos
imparted
to
him
his
greatness
of
soul
porthos
his
enthusiasm
aramis
his
elegance
had
d
artagnan
continued
his
intimacy
with
these
three
men
he
would
have
become
a
superior
character
athos
was
the
first
to
leave
him
in
order
that
he
might
retire
to
a
little
property
he
had
inherited
near
blois
porthos
the
second
to
marry
an
attorney
s
wife
and
lastly
aramis
the
third
to
take
orders
and
become
an
abbe
from
that
day
d
artagnan
felt
lonely
and
powerless
without
courage
to
pursue
a
career
in
which
he
could
only
distinguish
himself
on
condition
that
each
of
his
three
companions
should
endow
him
with
one
of
the
gifts
each
had
received
from
heaven
notwithstanding
his
commission
in
the
musketeers
d
artagnan
felt
completely
solitary
for
a
time
the
delightful
remembrance
of
madame
bonancieux
left
on
his
character
a
certain
poetic
tinge
perishable
indeed
for
like
all
other
recollections
in
this
world
these
impressions
were
by
degrees
effaced
a
garrison
life
is
fatal
even
to
the
most
aristocratic
organization
and
imperceptibly
d
artagnan
always
in
the
camp
always
on
horseback
always
in
garrison
became
i
know
not
how
in
the
present
age
one
would
express
it
a
typical
trooper
his
early
refinement
of
character
was
not
only
not
lost
it
grew
even
greater
than
ever
but
it
was
now
applied
to
the
little
instead
of
to
the
great
things
of
life
to
the
martial
condition
of
the
soldier
comprised
under
the
head
of
a
good
lodging
a
rich
table
a
congenial
hostess
these
important
advantages
d
artagnan
found
to
his
own
taste
in
the
rue
tiquetonne
at
the
sign
of
the
roe
from
the
time
d
artagnan
took
quarters
in
that
hotel
the
mistress
of
the
house
a
pretty
and
fresh
looking
flemish
woman
or
years
old
had
been
singularly
interested
in
him
and
after
certain
love
passages
much
obstructed
by
an
inconvenient
husband
to
whom
a
dozen
times
d
artagnan
had
made
a
pretence
of
passing
a
sword
through
his
body
that
husband
had
disappeared
one
fine
morning
after
furtively
selling
certain
choice
lots
of
wine
carrying
away
with
him
money
and
jewels
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
his
wife
especially
who
cherished
the
pleasing
idea
that
she
was
a
widow
stoutly
maintained
that
death
had
taken
him
therefore
after
the
connection
had
continued
three
years
carefully
fostered
by
d
artagnan
who
found
his
bed
and
his
mistress
more
agreeable
every
year
each
doing
credit
to
the
other
the
mistress
conceived
the
extraordinary
desire
of
becoming
a
wife
and
proposed
to
d
artagnan
that
he
should
marry
her
ah
fie
d
artagnan
replied
bigamy
my
dear
come
now
you
don
t
really
wish
it
but
he
is
dead
i
am
sure
of
he
was
a
very
contrary
fellow
and
might
come
back
on
purpose
to
have
us
all
right
if
he
comes
back
you
will
kill
him
you
are
so
skillful
and
so
peste
my
darling
another
way
of
getting
so
you
refuse
my
request
to
be
sure
i
do
furiously
the
pretty
landlady
was
desolate
she
would
have
taken
d
artagnan
not
only
as
her
husband
but
as
her
god
he
was
so
handsome
and
had
so
fierce
a
mustache
then
along
toward
the
fourth
year
came
the
expedition
of
d
artagnan
was
assigned
to
it
and
made
his
preparations
to
depart
there
were
then
great
griefs
tears
without
end
and
solemn
promises
to
remain
faithful
all
of
course
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
d
artagnan
was
too
grand
to
promise
anything
he
purposed
only
to
do
all
that
he
could
to
increase
the
glory
of
his
name
as
to
that
we
know
d
artagnan
s
courage
he
exposed
himself
freely
to
danger
and
while
charging
at
the
head
of
his
company
he
received
a
ball
through
the
chest
which
laid
him
prostrate
on
the
field
of
battle
he
had
been
seen
falling
from
his
horse
and
had
not
been
seen
to
rise
every
one
therefore
believed
him
to
be
dead
especially
those
to
whom
his
death
would
give
promotion
one
believes
readily
what
he
wishes
to
believe
now
in
the
army
from
the
who
desire
the
death
of
the
to
the
soldiers
who
desire
the
death
of
the
corporals
all
desire
some
one
s
death
but
d
artagnan
was
not
a
man
to
let
himself
be
killed
like
that
after
he
had
remained
through
the
heat
of
the
day
unconscious
on
the
the
cool
freshness
of
the
night
brought
him
to
himself
he
gained
a
village
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
finest
house
and
was
received
as
the
wounded
are
always
and
everywhere
received
in
france
he
was
petted
tended
cured
and
one
fine
morning
in
better
health
than
ever
before
he
set
out
for
france
once
in
france
he
turned
his
course
toward
paris
and
reaching
paris
went
straight
to
rue
tiquetonne
but
d
artagnan
found
in
his
chamber
the
personal
equipment
of
a
man
complete
except
for
the
sword
arranged
along
the
wall
he
has
returned
said
he
so
much
the
worse
and
so
much
the
better
it
need
not
be
said
that
d
artagnan
was
still
thinking
of
the
husband
he
made
inquiries
and
discovered
that
the
servants
were
new
and
that
the
mistress
had
gone
for
a
walk
alone
asked
d
artagnan
with
monsieur
has
returned
then
of
course
naively
replied
the
servant
if
i
had
any
money
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
i
would
go
away
but
i
have
none
i
must
stay
and
follow
the
advice
of
my
hostess
while
thwarting
the
conjugal
designs
of
this
inopportune
he
had
just
completed
this
monologue
which
proves
that
in
momentous
circumstances
nothing
is
more
natural
than
the
monologue
when
the
watching
at
the
door
suddenly
cried
out
ah
see
here
is
madame
returning
with
d
artagnan
looked
out
and
at
the
corner
of
rue
montmartre
saw
the
hostess
coming
along
hanging
to
the
arm
of
an
enormous
swiss
who
tiptoed
in
his
walk
with
a
magnificent
air
which
pleasantly
reminded
him
of
his
old
friend
porthos
is
that
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
oh
oh
he
has
grown
a
good
deal
it
seems
to
and
he
sat
down
in
the
hall
choosing
a
conspicuous
place
the
hostess
as
she
entered
saw
d
artagnan
and
uttered
a
little
cry
whereupon
d
artagnan
judging
that
he
had
been
recognized
rose
ran
to
her
and
embraced
her
tenderly
the
swiss
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
looked
at
the
hostess
who
turned
pale
ah
it
is
you
monsieur
what
do
you
want
of
me
she
asked
in
great
distress
is
monsieur
your
cousin
is
monsieur
your
brother
said
d
artagnan
not
in
the
slightest
degree
embarrassed
in
the
role
he
was
playing
and
without
waiting
for
her
reply
he
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
the
helvetian
who
received
him
with
great
coldness
who
is
that
man
he
asked
the
hostess
replied
only
by
gasps
who
is
that
swiss
asked
d
artagnan
monsieur
is
going
to
marry
me
replied
the
hostess
between
two
gasps
your
husband
then
is
at
last
dead
how
does
that
concern
you
replied
the
swiss
it
concerns
me
much
said
d
artagnan
since
you
can
not
marry
madame
without
my
consent
and
since
and
since
asked
the
swiss
and
since
i
do
not
give
it
said
the
musketeer
the
swiss
became
as
purple
as
a
peony
he
wore
his
elegant
uniform
d
artagnan
was
wrapped
in
a
sort
of
gray
cloak
the
swiss
was
six
feet
high
d
artagnan
was
hardly
more
than
five
the
swiss
considered
himself
on
his
own
ground
and
regarded
d
artagnan
as
an
intruder
will
you
go
away
from
here
demanded
the
swiss
stamping
violently
like
a
man
who
begins
to
be
seriously
angry
i
by
no
means
said
d
artagnan
some
one
must
go
for
help
said
a
lad
who
could
not
comprehend
that
this
little
man
should
make
a
stand
against
that
other
man
who
was
so
large
d
artagnan
with
a
sudden
accession
of
wrath
seized
the
lad
by
the
ear
and
led
him
apart
with
the
injunction
stay
you
where
you
are
and
don
t
you
stir
or
i
will
pull
this
ear
off
as
for
you
illustrious
descendant
of
william
tell
you
will
straightway
get
together
your
clothes
which
are
in
my
room
and
which
annoy
me
and
go
out
quickly
to
another
the
swiss
began
to
laugh
boisterously
i
go
out
he
said
and
why
ah
very
well
said
d
artagnan
i
see
that
you
understand
french
come
then
and
take
a
turn
with
me
and
i
will
the
hostess
who
knew
d
artagnan
s
skill
with
the
sword
began
to
weep
and
tear
her
hair
d
artagnan
turned
toward
her
saying
then
send
him
away
pooh
said
the
swiss
who
had
needed
a
little
time
to
take
in
d
artagnan
s
proposal
pooh
who
are
you
in
the
first
place
to
ask
me
to
take
a
turn
with
you
i
am
lieutenant
in
his
majesty
s
musketeers
said
d
artagnan
and
consequently
your
superior
in
everything
only
as
the
question
now
is
not
of
rank
but
of
quarters
you
know
the
custom
come
and
seek
for
yours
the
first
to
return
will
recover
his
d
artagnan
led
away
the
swiss
in
spite
of
lamentations
on
the
part
of
the
hostess
who
in
reality
found
her
heart
inclining
toward
her
former
lover
though
she
would
not
have
been
sorry
to
give
a
lesson
to
that
haughty
musketeer
who
had
affronted
her
by
the
refusal
of
her
hand
it
was
night
when
the
two
adversaries
reached
the
field
of
battle
d
artagnan
politely
begged
the
swiss
to
yield
to
him
the
disputed
chamber
the
swiss
refused
by
shaking
his
head
and
drew
his
sword
then
you
will
lie
here
said
d
artagnan
it
is
a
wretched
bed
but
that
is
not
my
fault
and
it
is
you
who
have
chosen
with
these
words
he
drew
in
his
turn
and
crossed
swords
with
his
adversary
he
had
to
contend
against
a
strong
wrist
but
his
agility
was
superior
to
all
force
the
swiss
received
two
wounds
and
was
not
aware
of
it
by
reason
of
the
cold
but
suddenly
feebleness
occasioned
by
loss
of
blood
obliged
him
to
sit
down
there
said
d
artagnan
what
did
i
tell
you
fortunately
you
won
t
be
laid
up
more
than
a
fortnight
remain
here
and
i
will
send
you
your
clothes
by
the
boy
oh
by
the
way
you
d
better
take
lodging
in
the
rue
montorgueil
at
the
chat
qui
pelote
you
will
be
well
fed
there
if
the
hostess
remains
the
same
thereupon
he
returned
in
a
lively
mood
to
his
room
and
sent
to
the
swiss
the
things
that
belonged
to
him
the
boy
found
him
sitting
where
d
artagnan
had
left
him
still
overwhelmed
by
the
coolness
of
his
adversary
the
boy
the
hostess
and
all
the
house
had
the
same
regard
for
d
artagnan
that
one
would
have
for
hercules
should
he
return
to
earth
to
repeat
his
twelve
labors
but
when
he
was
alone
with
the
hostess
he
said
now
pretty
madeleine
you
know
the
difference
between
a
swiss
and
a
gentleman
as
for
you
you
have
acted
like
a
barmaid
so
much
the
worse
for
you
for
by
such
conduct
you
have
lost
my
esteem
and
my
patronage
i
have
driven
away
the
swiss
to
humiliate
you
but
i
shall
lodge
here
no
longer
i
will
not
sleep
where
i
must
scorn
ho
there
boy
have
my
valise
carried
to
the
muid
d
amour
rue
des
bourdonnais
adieu
in
saying
these
words
d
artagnan
appeared
at
the
same
time
majestic
and
grieved
the
hostess
threw
herself
at
his
feet
asked
his
pardon
and
held
him
back
with
a
sweet
violence
what
more
need
be
said
the
spit
turned
the
stove
roared
the
pretty
madeleine
wept
d
artagnan
felt
himself
invaded
by
hunger
cold
and
love
he
pardoned
and
having
pardoned
he
remained
and
this
explains
how
d
artagnan
had
quarters
in
the
rue
tiquetonne
at
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
d
artagnan
then
returned
home
in
thoughtful
mood
finding
a
somewhat
lively
pleasure
in
carrying
mazarin
s
bag
of
money
and
thinking
of
that
fine
diamond
which
he
had
once
called
his
own
and
which
he
had
seen
on
the
minister
s
finger
that
night
should
that
diamond
ever
fall
into
my
hands
again
he
reflected
i
would
turn
it
at
once
into
money
i
would
buy
with
the
proceeds
certain
lands
around
my
father
s
chateau
which
is
a
pretty
place
well
enough
but
with
no
land
to
it
at
all
except
a
garden
about
the
size
of
the
cemetery
des
innocents
and
i
should
wait
in
all
my
glory
till
some
rich
heiress
attracted
by
my
good
looks
rode
along
to
marry
me
then
i
should
like
to
have
three
sons
i
should
make
the
first
a
nobleman
like
athos
the
second
a
good
soldier
like
porthos
the
third
an
excellent
abbe
like
aramis
faith
that
would
be
a
far
better
life
than
i
lead
now
but
monsieur
mazarin
is
a
mean
wretch
who
won
t
dispossess
himself
of
his
diamond
in
my
on
entering
the
rue
tiquetonne
he
heard
a
tremendous
noise
and
found
a
dense
crowd
near
the
house
oho
said
he
is
the
hotel
on
fire
on
approaching
the
hotel
of
the
roe
he
found
however
that
it
was
in
front
of
the
next
house
the
mob
was
collected
the
people
were
shouting
and
running
about
with
torches
by
the
light
of
one
of
these
torches
d
artagnan
perceived
men
in
uniform
he
asked
what
was
going
on
he
was
told
that
twenty
citizens
headed
by
one
man
had
attacked
a
carriage
which
was
escorted
by
a
troop
of
the
cardinal
s
bodyguard
but
a
reinforcement
having
come
up
the
assailants
had
been
put
to
flight
and
the
leader
had
taken
refuge
in
the
hotel
next
to
his
lodgings
the
house
was
now
being
searched
in
his
youth
d
artagnan
had
often
headed
the
bourgeoisie
against
the
military
but
he
was
cured
of
all
those
propensities
besides
he
had
the
cardinal
s
hundred
pistoles
in
his
pocket
so
he
went
into
the
hotel
without
a
word
there
he
found
madeleine
alarmed
for
his
safety
and
anxious
to
tell
him
all
the
events
of
the
evening
but
he
cut
her
short
by
ordering
her
to
put
his
supper
in
his
room
and
give
him
with
it
a
bottle
of
good
burgundy
he
took
his
key
and
candle
and
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
he
had
been
contented
for
the
convenience
of
the
house
to
lodge
in
the
fourth
story
and
truth
obliges
us
even
to
confess
that
his
chamber
was
just
above
the
gutter
and
below
the
roof
his
first
care
on
entering
it
was
to
lock
up
in
an
old
bureau
with
a
new
lock
his
bag
of
money
and
then
as
soon
as
supper
was
ready
he
sent
away
the
waiter
who
brought
it
up
and
sat
down
to
table
not
to
reflect
on
what
had
passed
as
one
might
fancy
no
d
artagnan
considered
that
things
are
never
well
done
when
they
are
not
reserved
to
their
proper
time
he
was
hungry
he
supped
he
went
to
bed
neither
was
he
one
of
those
who
think
that
the
necessary
silence
of
the
night
brings
counsel
with
it
in
the
night
he
slept
but
in
the
morning
refreshed
and
calm
he
was
inspired
with
his
clearest
views
of
everything
it
was
long
since
he
had
any
reason
for
his
morning
s
inspiration
but
he
always
slept
all
night
long
at
daybreak
he
awoke
and
took
a
turn
around
his
room
in
he
said
just
before
the
death
of
the
late
cardinal
i
received
a
letter
from
athos
where
was
i
then
let
me
see
oh
at
the
siege
of
besancon
i
was
in
the
trenches
he
told
me
let
me
think
what
was
it
that
he
was
living
on
a
small
estate
but
where
i
was
just
reading
the
name
of
the
place
when
the
wind
blew
my
letter
away
i
suppose
to
the
spaniards
there
s
no
use
in
thinking
any
more
about
athos
let
me
see
with
regard
to
porthos
i
received
a
letter
from
him
too
he
invited
me
to
a
hunting
party
on
his
property
in
the
month
of
september
unluckily
as
i
was
then
in
bearn
on
account
of
my
father
s
death
the
letter
followed
me
there
i
had
left
bearn
when
it
arrived
and
i
never
received
it
until
the
month
of
april
and
as
the
invitation
was
for
september
i
couldn
t
accept
it
let
me
look
for
this
letter
it
must
be
with
my
title
d
artagnan
opened
an
old
casket
which
stood
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
which
was
full
of
parchments
referring
to
an
estate
during
a
period
of
two
hundred
years
lost
to
his
family
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
for
the
large
handwriting
of
porthos
was
discernible
and
underneath
some
lines
traced
by
his
worthy
spouse
d
artagnan
eagerly
searched
for
the
heading
of
this
letter
it
was
dated
from
the
chateau
du
vallon
porthos
had
forgotten
that
any
other
address
was
necessary
in
his
pride
he
fancied
that
every
one
must
know
the
chateau
du
vallon
devil
take
the
vain
fellow
said
d
artagnan
however
i
had
better
find
him
out
first
since
he
can
t
want
money
athos
must
have
become
an
idiot
by
this
time
from
drinking
aramis
must
have
worn
himself
to
a
shadow
of
his
former
self
by
constant
he
cast
his
eyes
again
on
the
letter
there
was
a
postscript
i
write
by
the
same
courier
to
our
worthy
friend
aramis
in
his
in
his
convent
what
convent
there
are
about
two
hundred
in
paris
and
three
thousand
in
france
and
then
perhaps
on
entering
the
convent
he
changed
his
name
ah
if
i
were
but
learned
in
theology
i
should
recollect
what
it
was
he
used
to
dispute
about
with
the
curate
of
montdidier
and
the
superior
of
the
jesuits
when
we
were
at
crevecoeur
i
should
know
what
doctrine
he
leans
to
and
i
should
glean
from
that
what
saint
he
has
adopted
as
his
patron
well
suppose
i
go
back
to
the
cardinal
and
ask
him
for
a
passport
into
all
the
convents
one
can
find
even
into
the
nunneries
it
would
be
a
curious
idea
and
maybe
i
should
find
my
friend
under
the
name
of
achilles
but
no
i
should
lose
myself
in
the
cardinal
s
opinion
great
people
only
thank
you
for
doing
the
impossible
what
s
possible
they
say
they
can
effect
themselves
and
they
are
right
but
let
us
wait
a
little
and
reflect
i
received
a
letter
from
him
the
dear
fellow
in
which
he
even
asked
me
for
some
small
service
which
in
fact
i
rendered
him
yes
yes
but
now
what
did
i
do
with
that
letter
d
artagnan
thought
a
moment
and
then
went
to
the
wardrobe
in
which
hung
his
old
clothes
he
looked
for
his
doublet
of
the
year
and
as
he
had
orderly
habits
he
found
it
hanging
on
its
nail
he
felt
in
the
pocket
and
drew
from
it
a
paper
it
was
the
letter
of
aramis
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
know
that
i
have
had
a
quarrel
with
a
certain
gentleman
who
has
given
me
an
appointment
for
this
evening
in
the
place
royale
as
i
am
of
the
church
and
the
affair
might
injure
me
if
i
should
share
it
with
any
other
than
a
sure
friend
like
you
i
write
to
beg
that
you
will
serve
me
as
second
you
will
enter
by
the
rue
neuve
sainte
catherine
under
the
second
lamp
on
the
right
you
will
find
your
adversary
i
shall
be
with
mine
under
the
third
wholly
yours
d
artagnan
tried
to
recall
his
remembrances
he
had
gone
to
the
rendezvous
had
encountered
there
the
adversary
indicated
whose
name
he
had
never
known
had
given
him
a
pretty
on
the
arm
then
had
gone
toward
aramis
who
at
the
same
time
came
to
meet
him
having
already
finished
his
affair
it
is
over
aramis
had
said
i
think
i
have
killed
the
insolent
fellow
but
dear
friend
if
you
ever
need
me
you
know
that
i
am
entirely
devoted
to
thereupon
aramis
had
given
him
a
clasp
of
the
hand
and
had
disappeared
under
the
arcades
so
then
he
no
more
knew
where
aramis
was
than
where
athos
and
porthos
were
and
the
affair
was
becoming
a
matter
of
great
perplexity
when
he
fancied
he
heard
a
pane
of
glass
break
in
his
room
window
he
thought
directly
of
his
bag
and
rushed
from
the
inner
room
where
he
was
sleeping
he
was
not
mistaken
as
he
entered
his
bedroom
a
man
was
getting
in
by
the
window
ah
you
scoundrel
cried
d
artagnan
taking
the
man
for
a
thief
and
seizing
his
sword
sir
cried
the
man
in
the
name
of
heaven
put
your
sword
back
into
the
sheath
and
don
t
kill
me
unheard
i
m
no
thief
but
an
honest
citizen
well
off
in
the
world
with
a
house
of
my
own
my
name
is
ah
but
surely
you
are
monsieur
d
artagnan
and
thou
planchet
cried
the
lieutenant
at
your
service
sir
said
planchet
overwhelmed
with
joy
if
i
were
still
capable
of
serving
perhaps
so
replied
d
artagnan
but
why
the
devil
dost
thou
run
about
the
tops
of
houses
at
seven
o
clock
of
the
morning
in
the
month
of
january
sir
said
planchet
you
must
know
but
perhaps
you
ought
not
to
know
tell
us
what
returned
d
artagnan
but
first
put
a
napkin
against
the
window
and
draw
the
sir
said
the
prudent
planchet
in
the
first
place
are
you
on
good
terms
with
monsieur
de
rochefort
perfectly
one
of
my
dearest
ah
so
much
the
better
but
what
has
de
rochefort
to
do
with
this
manner
you
have
of
invading
my
room
ah
sir
i
must
first
tell
you
that
monsieur
de
rochefort
is
planchet
hesitated
egad
i
know
where
he
is
said
d
artagnan
he
s
in
the
that
is
to
say
he
was
there
replied
planchet
but
in
returning
thither
last
night
when
fortunately
you
did
not
accompany
him
as
his
carriage
was
crossing
the
rue
de
la
ferronnerie
his
guards
insulted
the
people
who
began
to
abuse
them
the
prisoner
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
for
escape
he
called
out
his
name
and
cried
for
help
i
was
there
i
heard
the
name
of
rochefort
i
remembered
him
well
i
said
in
a
loud
voice
that
he
was
a
prisoner
a
friend
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
who
called
for
help
the
people
were
infuriated
they
stopped
the
horses
and
cut
the
escort
to
pieces
whilst
i
opened
the
doors
of
the
carriage
and
monsieur
de
rochefort
jumped
out
and
soon
was
lost
amongst
the
crowd
at
this
moment
a
patrol
passed
by
i
was
obliged
to
sound
a
retreat
toward
the
rue
tiquetonne
i
was
pursued
and
took
refuge
in
the
house
next
to
this
where
i
have
been
concealed
between
two
mattresses
this
morning
i
ventured
to
run
along
the
gutters
and
well
interrupted
d
artagnan
i
am
delighted
that
de
rochefort
is
free
but
as
for
thee
if
thou
shouldst
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
king
s
servants
they
will
hang
thee
without
mercy
nevertheless
i
promise
thee
thou
shalt
be
hidden
here
though
i
risk
by
concealing
thee
neither
more
nor
less
than
my
lieutenancy
if
it
was
found
out
that
i
gave
one
rebel
an
ah
sir
you
know
well
i
would
risk
my
life
for
thou
mayst
add
that
thou
hast
risked
it
planchet
i
have
not
forgotten
all
i
owe
thee
sit
down
there
and
eat
in
security
i
see
thee
cast
expressive
glances
at
the
remains
of
my
yes
sir
for
all
i
ve
had
since
yesterday
was
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
with
preserves
on
it
although
i
don
t
despise
sweet
things
in
proper
time
and
place
i
found
the
supper
rather
poor
fellow
said
d
artagnan
well
come
set
ah
sir
you
are
going
to
save
my
life
a
second
time
cried
planchet
and
he
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
ate
as
he
did
in
the
merry
days
of
the
rue
des
fossoyeurs
whilst
d
artagnan
walked
to
and
fro
and
thought
how
he
could
make
use
of
planchet
under
present
circumstances
while
he
turned
this
over
in
his
mind
planchet
did
his
best
to
make
up
for
lost
time
at
table
at
last
he
uttered
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
and
paused
as
if
he
had
partially
appeased
his
hunger
come
said
d
artagnan
who
thought
that
it
was
now
a
convenient
time
to
begin
his
interrogations
dost
thou
know
where
athos
is
no
sir
replied
planchet
the
devil
thou
dost
not
dost
know
where
porthos
is
no
not
at
and
aramis
not
in
the
the
devil
the

but

planchet
with
a
look
of
shrewdness

must
know
where
his
master
is
without
a
doubt
he
d
artagnan
thought
for
a
moment
then
took
his
sword
and
put
on
his
cloak
to
go
out
sir
said
planchet
in
a
mournful
tone
do
you
abandon
me
thus
to
my
fate
think
if
i
am
found
out
here
the
people
of
the
house

not
seen

will
take
me

artagnan
opened
the
door
and
called
out
to
a
waiter
to
desire
madeleine
to
come
upstairs
when
the
landlady
made
her
appearance
she
expressed
much
astonishment
at
seeing
planchet
my
dear
landlady
said
d
artagnan
i
beg

d

was
on
his
way
to
notre
dame
touches
upon
the
strange
effects
a
may
have
d
artagnan
as
he
crossed
the
pont
neuf
congratulated
himself
on
having
found
planchet
again
for
at
that
time
an
intelligent
servant
was
essential
to
him
nor
was
he
sorry
that
through
planchet
and
the
situation
which
he
held
in
rue
des
lombards
a
connection
with
the
bourgeoisie
might
be
commenced
at
that
critical
period
when
that
class
were
preparing
to
make
war
with
the
court
party
it
was
like
having
a
spy
in

this
frame
of
mind
grateful
for
the
accidental
meeting
with
planchet

with
himself

reached

ran
up
the
steps
entered
the

and
addressing
a
verger
who
was
sweeping
the
chapel
asked
him
if
he
knew
monsieur
bazin
monsieur
bazin
the
beadle
said
the
verger
yes
there
he
is
attending
mass
in
the
chapel
of
the
d
artagnan
nearly
jumped
for
joy
he
had
despaired
of
finding
bazin
but
now
he
thought
since
he
held
one
end
of
the
thread
he
would
be
pretty
sure
to
reach
the
other
end
he
knelt
down
just
opposite
the
chapel
in
order
not
to
lose
sight
of
his
man
and
as
he
had
almost
forgotten
his
prayers
and
had
omitted
to
take
a
book
with
him
he
made
use
of
his
time
in
gazing
at
bazin
bazin
wore
his
dress
it
may
be
observed
with
equal
dignity
and
saintly
propriety
it
was
not
difficult
to
understand
that
he
had
gained
the
crown
of
his
ambition
and
that
the
wand
he
brandished
was
in
his
eyes
as
honorable
a
distinction
as
the
marshal
s
baton
which
conde
threw
or
did
not
throw
into
the
enemy
s
line
of
battle
at
fribourg
his
person
had
undergone
a
change
analogous
to
the
change
in
his
dress
his
figure
had
grown
rotund
and
as
it
were
canonical
the
striking
points
of
his
face
were
effaced
he
had
still
a
nose
but
his
cheeks
fattened
out
each
took
a
portion
of
it
unto
themselves
his
chin
had
joined
his
throat
his
eyes
were
swelled
up
with
the
puffiness
of
his
cheeks
his
hair
cut
straight
in
holy
guise
covered
his
forehead
as
far
as
his
eyebrows
the
officiating
priest
was
just
finishing
mass
whilst
d
artagnan
was
looking
at
bazin
he
pronounced
the
words
of
the
holy
sacrament
and
retired
giving
the
benediction
which
was
received
by
the
kneeling
communicants
to
the
astonishment
of
d
artagnan
who
recognized
in
the
priest
the
himself
the
famous
jean
francois
gondy
who
at
that
time
having
a
presentiment
of
the
part
he
was
to
play
was
beginning
to
court
popularity
by
almsgiving
it
was
to
this
end
that
he
performed
from
time
to
time
some
of
those
early
masses
which
the
common
people
generally
alone
attended
a
sacerdotal
d
artagnan
knelt
as
well
as
the
rest
received
his
share
of
the
benediction
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
when
bazin
passed
in
his
turn
with
his
eyes
raised
to
heaven
and
walking
in
all
humility
the
very
last
d
artagnan
pulled
him
by
the
hem
of
his
robe
bazin
looked
down
and
started
as
if
he
had
seen
a
serpent
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
cried
vade
retro
satanas
so
my
dear
bazin
said
the
officer
laughing
this
is
the
way
you
receive
an
old
sir
replied
bazin
the
true
friends
of
a
christian
are
those
who
aid
him
in
working
out
his
salvation
not
those
who
hinder
him
in
doing
i
don
t
understand
you
bazin
nor
can
i
see
how
i
can
be
a
in
the
way
of
your
salvation
said
d
artagnan
you
forget
sir
that
you
very
nearly
ruined
forever
that
of
my
master
and
that
it
was
owing
to
you
that
he
was
very
nearly
being
damned
eternally
for
remaining
a
musketeer
whilst
all
the
time
his
true
vocation
was
the
my
dear
bazin
you
ought
to
perceive
said
d
artagnan
from
the
place
in
which
you
find
me
that
i
am
greatly
changed
in
everything
age
produces
good
sense
and
as
i
doubt
not
but
that
your
master
is
on
the
road
to
salvation
i
want
you
to
tell
me
where
he
is
that
he
may
help
me
to
rather
say
to
take
him
back
with
you
into
the
world
fortunately
i
don
t
know
where
he
how
cried
d
artagnan
you
don
t
know
where
aramis
is
formerly
replied
bazin
aramis
was
his
name
of
perdition
by
aramis
is
meant
simara
which
is
the
name
of
a
demon
happily
for
him
he
has
ceased
to
bear
that
and
therefore
said
d
artagnan
resolved
to
be
patient
to
the
end
it
is
not
aramis
i
seek
but
the
abbe
d
herblay
come
my
dear
bazin
tell
me
where
he
didn
t
you
hear
me
tell
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
that
i
don
t
know
where
he
is
yes
certainly
but
to
that
i
answer
that
it
is
it
is
nevertheless
the
truth
monsieur
the
pure
truth
the
truth
of
the
good
d
artagnan
saw
clearly
that
he
would
get
nothing
out
of
this
man
who
was
evidently
telling
a
falsehood
in
his
pretended
ignorance
of
the
abode
of
aramis
but
whose
lies
were
bold
and
decided
well
bazin
said
d
artagnan
since
you
do
not
know
where
your
master
lives
let
us
speak
of
it
no
more
let
us
part
good
friends
accept
this
to
drink
to
my
i
do
not
drink
bazin
pushed
away
with
dignity
the
officer
s
hand
tis
good
only
for
the
incorruptible
murmured
d
artagnan
i
am
unlucky
and
whilst
he
was
lost
in
thought
bazin
retreated
toward
the
sacristy
and
even
there
he
could
not
think
himself
safe
until
he
had
shut
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
d
artagnan
was
still
in
deep
thought
when
some
one
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
he
turned
and
was
about
to
utter
an
exclamation
of
surprise
when
the
other
made
to
him
a
sign
of
silence
you
here
rochefort
he
said
in
a
low
voice
hush
returned
rochefort
did
you
know
that
i
am
at
liberty
i
knew
it
from
the
from
planchet
and
what
brought
you
here
i
came
to
thank
god
for
my
happy
deliverance
said
rochefort
and
nothing
more
i
suppose
that
is
not
to
take
my
orders
from
the
coadjutor
and
to
see
if
we
can
not
wake
up
mazarin
a
a
bad
plan
you
ll
be
shut
up
again
in
the
oh
as
to
that
i
shall
take
care
i
assure
you
the
air
the
fresh
free
air
is
so
good
besides
and
rochefort
drew
a
deep
breath
as
he
spoke
i
am
going
into
the
country
to
make
a
stop
cried
d
artagnan
i
too
am
and
if
i
may
without
impertinence
ask
where
are
you
going
to
seek
my
what
friends
those
that
you
asked
about
athos
porthos
and
aramis
you
are
looking
for
them
on
honor
what
then
is
there
surprising
in
that
nothing
queer
though
and
in
whose
behalf
are
you
looking
for
them
you
are
in
no
doubt
on
that
that
is
unfortunately
i
have
no
idea
where
they
and
you
have
no
way
to
get
news
of
them
wait
a
week
and
i
myself
will
give
you
a
week
is
too
long
i
must
find
them
within
three
three
days
are
a
short
time
and
france
is
no
matter
you
know
the
word
must
with
that
word
great
things
are
and
when
do
you
set
out
i
am
now
on
my
good
luck
to
and
to
you
a
good
perhaps
we
shall
meet
on
our
that
is
not
who
knows
chance
is
so
capricious
adieu
till
we
meet
again
apropos
should
mazarin
speak
to
you
about
me
tell
him
that
i
should
have
requested
you
to
acquaint
him
that
in
a
short
time
he
will
see
whether
i
am
as
he
says
too
old
for
and
rochefort
went
away
with
one
of
those
diabolical
smiles
which
used
formerly
to
make
d
artagnan
shudder
but
d
artagnan
could
now
see
it
without
alarm
and
smiling
in
his
turn
with
an
expression
of
melancholy
which
the
recollections
called
up
by
that
smile
could
perhaps
alone
give
to
his
countenance
he
said
go
demon
do
what
thou
wilt
it
matters
little
now
to
me
there
s
no
second
constance
in
the
on
his
return
to
the
cathedral
d
artagnan
saw
bazin
who
was
conversing
with
the
sacristan
bazin
was
making
with
his
spare
little
short
arms
ridiculous
gestures
d
artagnan
perceived
that
he
was
enforcing
prudence
with
respect
to
himself
d
artagnan
slipped
out
of
the
cathedral
and
placed
himself
in
ambuscade
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
canettes
it
was
impossible
that
bazin
should
go
out
of
the
cathedral
without
his
seeing
him
in
five
minutes
bazin
made
his
appearance
looking
in
every
direction
to
see
if
he
were
observed
but
he
saw
no
one
calmed
by
appearances
he
ventured
to
walk
on
through
the
rue
notre
dame
then
d
artagnan
rushed
out
of
his
hiding
place
and
arrived
in
time
to
see
bazin
turn
down
the
rue
de
la
juiverie
and
enter
in
the
rue
de
la
calandre
a
respectable
looking
house
and
this
d
artagnan
felt
no
doubt
was
the
habitation
of
the
worthy
beadle
afraid
of
making
any
inquiries
at
this
house
d
artagnan
entered
a
small
tavern
at
the
corner
of
the
street
and
asked
for
a
cup
of
hypocras
this
beverage
required
a
good
to
prepare
and
d
artagnan
had
time
therefore
to
watch
bazin
unsuspected
he
perceived
in
the
tavern
a
pert
boy
between
twelve
and
fifteen
years
of
age
whom
he
fancied
he
had
seen
not
twenty
minutes
before
under
the
guise
of
a
chorister
he
questioned
him
and
as
the
boy
had
no
interest
in
deceiving
d
artagnan
learned
that
he
exercised
from
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
until
nine
the
office
of
chorister
and
from
nine
o
clock
till
midnight
that
of
a
waiter
in
the
tavern
whilst
he
was
talking
to
this
lad
a
horse
was
brought
to
the
door
of
bazin
s
house
it
was
saddled
and
bridled
almost
immediately
bazin
came
downstairs
look
said
the
boy
there
s
our
beadle
who
is
going
a
and
where
is
he
going
asked
d
artagnan
forsooth
i
don
t
half
a
pistole
if
you
can
find
out
said
d
artagnan
for
me
cried
the
boy
his
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
if
i
can
find
out
where
bazin
is
going
that
is
not
difficult
you
are
not
joking
are
you
no
on
the
honor
of
an
officer
there
is
the
and
he
showed
him
the
seductive
coin
but
did
not
give
it
him
i
shall
ask
just
the
very
way
not
to
know
wait
till
he
is
set
out
and
then
marry
come
up
ask
and
find
out
the
is
ready
and
he
put
it
back
again
into
his
pocket
i
understand
said
the
child
with
that
jeering
smile
which
marks
especially
the
gamin
de
well
we
must
they
had
not
long
to
wait
five
minutes
afterward
bazin
set
off
on
a
full
trot
urging
on
his
horse
by
the
blows
of
a
parapluie
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
using
instead
of
a
riding
whip
scarcely
had
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
juiverie
when
the
boy
rushed
after
him
like
a
bloodhound
on
full
scent
before
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
the
child
returned
well
said
d
artagnan
well
answered
the
boy
the
thing
is
where
is
he
gone
the
is
for
me
doubtless
answer
i
want
to
see
it
give
it
me
that
i
may
see
it
is
not
there
it
the
child
put
the
piece
of
money
into
his
pocket
and
now
where
is
he
gone
inquired
d
artagnan
he
is
gone
to
how
dost
thou
know
ah
faith
there
was
no
great
cunning
necessary
i
knew
the
horse
he
rode
it
belonged
to
the
butcher
who
lets
it
out
now
and
then
to
bazin
now
i
thought
that
the
butcher
would
not
let
his
horse
out
like
that
without
knowing
where
it
was
going
and
he
answered
that
monsieur
bazin
went
to
tis
his
custom
he
goes
two
or
three
times
a
dost
thou
know
noisy
well
i
think
so
truly
my
nurse
lives
is
there
a
convent
at
noisy
isn
t
there
a
great
and
grand
one
the
convent
of
jesuits
what
is
thy
name
d
artagnan
wrote
the
child
s
name
in
his
tablets
please
sir
said
the
boy
do
you
think
i
can
gain
any
more
in
any
way
perhaps
replied
d
artagnan
and
having
got
out
all
he
wanted
he
paid
for
the
hypocras
which
he
did
not
drink
and
went
quickly
back
to
the
rue
tiquetonne
d
artagnan
going
to
a
distance
to
discover
aramis
on
entering
the
hotel
d
artagnan
saw
a
man
sitting
in
a
corner
by
the
fire
it
was
planchet
but
so
completely
transformed
thanks
to
the
old
clothes
that
the
departing
husband
had
left
behind
that
d
artagnan
himself
could
hardly
recognize
him
madeleine
introduced
him
in
presence
of
all
the
servants
planchet
addressed
the
officer
with
a
fine
flemish
phrase
the
officer
replied
in
words
that
belonged
to
no
language
at
all
and
the
bargain
was
concluded
madeleine
s
brother
entered
d
artagnan
s
service
the
plan
adopted
by
d
artagnan
was
soon
perfected
he
resolved
not
to
reach
noisy
in
the
day
for
fear
of
being
recognized
he
had
therefore
plenty
of
time
before
him
for
noisy
is
only
three
or
four
leagues
from
paris
on
the
road
to
meaux
he
began
his
day
by
breakfasting
substantially
a
bad
beginning
when
one
wants
to
employ
the
head
but
an
excellent
precaution
when
one
wants
to
work
the
body
and
about
two
o
clock
he
had
his
two
horses
saddled
and
followed
by
planchet
he
quitted
paris
by
the
barriere
de
la
villete
a
most
active
search
was
still
prosecuted
in
the
house
near
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
for
the
discovery
of
planchet
at
about
a
league
and
a
half
from
the
city
d
artagnan
finding
that
in
his
impatience
he
had
set
out
too
soon
stopped
to
give
the
horses
breathing
time
the
inn
was
full
of
disreputable
looking
people
who
seemed
as
if
they
were
on
the
point
of
commencing
some
nightly
expedition
a
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
appeared
at
the
door
but
seeing
a
stranger
he
beckoned
to
his
companions
and
two
men
who
were
drinking
in
the
inn
went
out
to
speak
to
him
d
artagnan
on
his
side
went
up
to
the
landlady
praised
her
wine
which
was
a
horrible
production
from
the
country
of
montreuil
and
heard
from
her
that
there
were
only
two
houses
of
importance
in
the
village
one
of
these
belonged
to
the
archbishop
of
paris
and
was
at
that
time
the
abode
of
his
niece
the
duchess
of
longueville
the
other
was
a
convent
of
jesuits
and
was
the
property
a
by
no
means
unusual
circumstance
of
these
worthy
fathers
at
four
o
clock
d
artagnan
recommenced
his
journey
he
proceeded
slowly
and
in
deep
reverie
planchet
also
was
lost
in
thought
but
the
subject
of
their
reflections
was
not
the
same
one
word
which
their
landlady
had
pronounced
had
given
a
particular
turn
to
d
artagnan
s
deliberations
this
was
the
name
of
madame
de
longueville
that
name
was
indeed
one
to
inspire
imagination
and
produce
thought
madame
de
longueville
was
one
of
the
highest
ladies
in
the
realm
she
was
also
one
of
the
greatest
beauties
at
court
she
had
formerly
been
suspected
of
an
intimacy
of
too
tender
a
nature
with
coligny
who
for
her
sake
had
been
killed
in
a
duel
in
the
place
royale
by
the
duc
de
guise
she
was
now
connected
by
bonds
of
a
political
nature
with
the
prince
de
marsillac
the
eldest
son
of
the
old
duc
de
rochefoucauld
whom
she
was
trying
to
inspire
with
an
enmity
toward
the
duc
de
conde
her
whom
she
now
hated
mortally
d
artagnan
thought
of
all
these
matters
he
remembered
how
at
the
louvre
he
had
often
seen
as
she
passed
by
him
in
the
full
radiance
of
her
dazzling
charms
the
beautiful
madame
de
longueville
he
thought
of
aramis
who
without
possessing
any
greater
advantages
than
himself
had
formerly
been
the
lover
of
madame
de
chevreuse
who
had
been
to
a
former
court
what
madame
de
longueville
was
in
that
day
and
he
wondered
how
it
was
that
there
should
be
in
the
world
people
who
succeed
in
every
wish
some
in
ambition
others
in
love
whilst
others
either
from
chance
or
from
or
from
some
natural
defect
or
impediment
remain
upon
the
road
toward
fulfilment
of
their
hopes
and
expectations
he
was
confessing
to
himself
that
he
belonged
to
the
latter
unhappy
class
when
planchet
approached
and
said
i
will
lay
a
wager
your
honor
that
you
and
i
are
thinking
of
the
same
i
doubt
it
planchet
replied
d
artagnan
but
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
am
thinking
sir
of
those
desperate
looking
men
who
were
drinking
in
the
inn
where
we
always
cautious
tis
instinct
your
well
what
does
your
instinct
tell
you
now
sir
my
instinct
told
me
that
those
people
were
assembled
there
for
some
bad
purpose
and
i
was
reflecting
on
what
my
instinct
had
told
me
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
stable
when
a
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
and
followed
by
two
other
men
came
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
planchet
s
recital
agreeing
with
his
own
observations
well
one
of
these
two
men
said
he
must
certainly
be
at
noisy
or
be
coming
there
this
evening
for
i
have
seen
his
art
thou
sure
said
the
man
in
the
cloak
yes
my
my
prince
interrupted
d
artagnan
yes
my
prince
but
listen
if
he
is
here
this
is
what
the
other
man
said
let
s
see
decidedly
what
to
do
with
what
to
do
with
him
answered
the
prince
yes
he
s
not
a
man
to
allow
himself
to
be
taken
anyhow
he
ll
defend
well
we
must
try
to
take
him
alive
have
you
cords
to
bind
him
with
and
a
gag
to
stop
his
mouth
we
remember
that
he
will
most
likely
be
disguised
as
a
yes
yes
my
lord
don
t
be
besides
i
shall
be
you
will
assure
us
that
justice
yes
yes
i
answer
for
all
that
the
prince
said
well
then
we
ll
do
our
having
said
that
they
went
out
of
the
well
what
matters
all
that
to
us
said
d
artagnan
this
is
one
of
those
attempts
that
happen
every
are
you
sure
that
we
are
not
its
objects
we
why
just
remember
what
they
said
i
have
seen
his
servant
said
one
and
that
applies
very
well
to
well
he
must
certainly
be
at
noisy
or
be
coming
there
this
evening
said
the
other
and
that
applies
very
well
to
what
else
then
the
prince
said
take
notice
that
in
all
probability
he
will
be
disguised
as
a
cavalier
which
seems
to
me
to
leave
no
room
for
doubt
since
you
are
dressed
as
a
cavalier
and
not
as
an
officer
of
musketeers
now
then
what
do
you
say
to
that
alas
my
dear
planchet
said
d
artagnan
sighing
we
are
unfortunately
no
longer
in
those
times
in
which
princes
would
care
to
assassinate
me
those
were
good
old
days
never
fear
these
people
owe
us
no
is
your
honor
sure
i
can
answer
for
it
they
do
well
we
won
t
speak
of
it
any
more
then
and
planchet
took
his
place
in
d
artagnan
s
suite
with
that
sublime
confidence
he
had
always
had
in
his
master
which
even
fifteen
years
of
separation
had
not
destroyed
they
had
traveled
onward
about
half
a
mile
when
planchet
came
close
up
to
d
artagnan
stop
sir
look
yonder
he
whispered
don
t
you
see
in
the
darkness
something
pass
by
like
shadows
i
fancy
i
hear
horses
impossible
returned
d
artagnan
the
ground
is
soaking
wet
yet
i
fancy
as
thou
sayest
that
i
see
at
this
moment
the
neighing
of
a
horse
struck
his
ear
coming
through
darkness
and
space
there
are
men
somewhere
about
but
that
s
of
no
consequence
to
us
said
d
artagnan
let
us
ride
at
about
eight
o
clock
they
reached
the
first
houses
in
noisy
every
one
was
in
bed
and
not
a
light
was
to
be
seen
in
the
village
the
obscurity
was
broken
only
now
and
then
by
the
still
darker
lines
of
the
roofs
of
houses
here
and
there
a
dog
barked
behind
a
door
or
an
affrighted
cat
fled
precipitately
from
the
midst
of
the
pavement
to
take
refuge
behind
a
pile
of
faggots
from
which
retreat
her
eyes
would
shine
like
peridores
these
were
the
only
living
creatures
that
seemed
to
inhabit
the
village
toward
the
middle
of
the
town
commanding
the
principal
open
space
rose
a
dark
mass
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
world
by
two
lanes
and
overshadowed
in
the
front
by
enormous
d
artagnan
looked
attentively
at
the
building
this
he
said
to
planchet
must
be
the
archbishop
s
chateau
the
abode
of
the
fair
madame
de
longueville
but
the
convent
where
is
that
the
convent
your
honor
is
at
the
other
end
of
the
village
i
know
it
well
then
planchet
gallop
up
to
it
whilst
i
tighten
my
horse
s
girth
and
come
back
and
tell
me
if
there
is
a
light
in
any
of
the
jesuits
in
about
five
minutes
planchet
returned
sir
he
said
there
is
one
window
of
the
convent
lighted
hem
if
i
were
a
frondeur
said
d
artagnan
i
should
knock
here
and
should
be
sure
of
a
good
supper
if
i
were
a
monk
i
should
knock
yonder
and
should
have
a
good
supper
there
too
whereas
tis
very
possible
that
between
the
castle
and
the
convent
we
shall
sleep
on
hard
beds
dying
with
hunger
and
yes
added
planchet
like
the
famous
ass
of
buridan
shall
i
knock
hush
replied
d
artagnan
the
light
no
longer
burns
in
yonder
do
you
hear
nothing
whispered
planchet
what
is
that
noise
there
came
a
sound
like
a
whirlwind
at
the
same
time
two
troops
of
horsemen
each
composed
of
ten
men
sallied
forth
from
each
of
the
lanes
which
encompassed
the
house
and
surrounded
d
artagnan
and
planchet
heyday
cried
d
artagnan
drawing
his
sword
and
taking
refuge
behind
his
horse
are
you
not
mistaken
is
it
really
for
us
that
you
mean
your
attack
here
he
is
we
have
him
cried
the
horsemen
rushing
on
d
artagnan
with
naked
swords
don
t
let
him
escape
said
a
loud
voice
no
my
lord
be
assured
we
shall
d
artagnan
thought
it
was
now
time
for
him
to
join
in
the
conversation
halloo
gentlemen
he
called
out
in
his
gascon
accent
what
do
you
want
what
do
you
demand
that
thou
shalt
soon
know
shouted
a
chorus
of
horsemen
stop
stop
cried
he
whom
they
had
addressed
as
my
lord
tis
not
his
ah
just
so
gentlemen
pray
do
people
get
into
a
passion
at
random
at
noisy
take
care
for
i
warn
you
that
the
first
man
that
comes
within
the
length
of
my
sword
and
my
sword
is
long
i
rip
him
the
chieftain
of
the
party
drew
near
what
are
you
doing
here
he
asked
in
a
lofty
tone
as
that
of
one
accustomed
to
command
and
you
what
are
you
doing
here
replied
d
artagnan
be
civil
or
i
shall
beat
you
for
although
one
may
not
choose
to
proclaim
oneself
one
insists
on
respect
suitable
to
one
s
you
don
t
choose
to
discover
yourself
because
you
are
the
leader
of
an
ambuscade
returned
d
artagnan
but
with
regard
to
myself
who
am
traveling
quietly
with
my
own
servant
i
have
not
the
same
reasons
as
you
have
to
conceal
my
enough
enough
what
is
your
name
i
shall
tell
you
my
name
in
order
that
you
may
know
where
to
find
me
my
lord
or
my
prince
as
it
may
suit
you
best
to
be
called
said
our
gascon
who
did
not
choose
to
seem
to
yield
to
a
threat
do
you
know
monsieur
d
artagnan
lieutenant
in
the
king
s
musketeers
said
the
voice
you
are
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
then
you
came
here
to
defend
him
him
whom
the
man
we
are
it
seems
said
d
artagnan
that
whilst
i
thought
i
was
coming
to
noisy
i
have
entered
without
suspecting
it
into
the
kingdom
of
come
replied
the
same
lofty
tone
answer
are
you
waiting
for
him
underneath
these
windows
did
you
come
to
noisy
to
defend
him
i
am
waiting
for
no
one
replied
d
artagnan
who
was
beginning
to
be
angry
i
propose
to
defend
no
one
but
myself
and
i
shall
defend
myself
vigorously
i
give
you
very
well
said
the
voice
go
away
from
here
and
leave
the
place
to
go
away
from
here
said
d
artagnan
whose
purposes
were
in
conflict
with
that
order
that
is
not
so
easy
since
i
am
on
the
point
of
falling
and
my
horse
too
through
fatigue
unless
indeed
you
are
disposed
to
offer
me
a
supper
and
a
bed
in
the
rascal
eh
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
i
beg
you
will
have
a
care
what
you
say
for
if
you
utter
another
word
like
that
be
you
marquis
duke
prince
or
king
i
will
thrust
it
down
your
throat
do
you
hear
well
well
rejoined
the
leader
there
s
no
doubt
tis
a
gascon
who
is
speaking
and
therefore
not
the
man
we
are
looking
for
our
blow
has
failed
for
let
us
withdraw
we
shall
meet
again
master
d
artagnan
continued
the
leader
raising
his
voice
yes
but
never
with
the
same
advantages
said
d
artagnan
in
a
tone
of
raillery
for
when
you
meet
me
again
you
will
perhaps
be
alone
and
there
will
be
very
good
very
good
said
the
voice
en
route
and
the
troop
grumbling
angrily
disappeared
in
the
darkness
and
took
the
road
to
paris
d
artagnan
and
planchet
remained
for
some
moments
still
on
the
defensive
then
as
the
noise
of
the
horsemen
became
more
and
more
distant
they
sheathed
their
swords
thou
seest
simpleton
said
d
artagnan
to
his
servant
that
they
wished
no
harm
to
but
to
whom
then
i
faith
i
neither
know
nor
care
what
i
do
care
for
now
is
to
make
my
way
into
the
jesuits
convent
so
to
horse
and
let
us
knock
at
their
door
happen
what
will
the
devil
take
them
they
can
t
eat
and
he
mounted
his
horse
planchet
had
just
done
the
same
when
an
unexpected
weight
fell
upon
the
back
of
the
horse
which
sank
down
hey
your
honor
cried
planchet
i
ve
a
man
behind
d
artagnan
turned
around
and
plainly
saw
two
human
forms
on
planchet
s
horse
tis
then
the
devil
that
pursues
he
cried
drawing
his
sword
and
preparing
to
attack
the
new
foe
no
no
dear
d
artagnan
said
the
figure
tis
not
the
devil
tis
aramis
gallop
fast
planchet
and
when
you
come
to
the
end
of
the
village
turn
swiftly
to
the
and
planchet
with
aramis
behind
him
set
off
at
full
gallop
followed
by
d
artagnan
who
began
to
think
he
was
in
the
merry
maze
of
some
fantastic
dream
the
abbe
d
herblay
at
the
extremity
of
the
village
planchet
turned
to
the
left
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
aramis
and
stopped
underneath
the
window
which
had
light
in
it
aramis
alighted
and
clapped
his
hands
three
times
immediately
the
window
was
opened
and
a
ladder
of
rope
was
let
down
from
it
my
friend
said
aramis
if
you
like
to
ascend
i
shall
be
delighted
to
receive
ah
said
d
artagnan
is
that
the
way
you
return
to
your
apartment
after
nine
at
night
pardieu
said
aramis
the
rule
of
the
convent
is
very
pardon
me
my
dear
friend
said
d
artagnan
i
think
you
said
pardieu
do
you
think
so
said
aramis
smiling
it
is
possible
you
have
no
idea
my
dear
fellow
how
one
acquires
bad
habits
in
these
cursed
convents
or
what
evil
ways
all
these
men
of
the
church
have
with
whom
i
am
obliged
to
live
but
will
you
not
go
up
pass
on
before
me
i
beg
of
as
the
late
cardinal
used
to
say
to
the
late
king
only
to
show
you
the
way
and
aramis
ascended
the
ladder
quickly
and
reached
the
window
in
an
instant
d
artagnan
followed
but
less
nimbly
showing
plainly
that
this
mode
of
ascent
was
not
one
to
which
he
was
accustomed
i
beg
your
pardon
said
aramis
noticing
his
awkwardness
if
i
had
known
that
i
was
to
have
the
honor
of
your
visit
i
should
have
procured
the
gardener
s
ladder
but
for
me
alone
this
is
good
sir
said
planchet
when
he
saw
d
artagnan
on
the
summit
of
the
ladder
this
way
is
easy
for
monsieur
aramis
and
even
for
you
in
case
of
necessity
i
might
also
climb
up
but
my
two
horses
can
not
mount
the
take
them
to
yonder
shed
my
friend
said
aramis
pointing
to
a
low
building
on
the
plain
there
you
will
find
hay
and
straw
for
them
then
come
back
here
and
clap
your
hands
three
times
and
we
will
give
you
wine
and
food
marry
forsooth
people
don
t
die
of
hunger
and
aramis
drawing
in
the
ladder
closed
the
window
d
artagnan
then
looked
around
attentively
never
was
there
an
apartment
at
the
same
time
more
warlike
and
more
elegant
at
each
corner
were
arranged
trophies
presenting
to
view
swords
of
all
sorts
and
on
the
walls
hung
four
great
pictures
representing
in
their
ordinary
military
costume
the
cardinal
de
lorraine
the
cardinal
de
richelieu
the
cardinal
de
la
valette
and
the
archbishop
of
bordeaux
exteriorly
nothing
in
the
room
showed
that
it
was
the
habitation
of
an
abbe
the
hangings
were
of
damask
the
carpets
from
alencon
and
the
bed
especially
had
more
the
look
of
a
fine
lady
s
couch
with
its
trimmings
of
fine
lace
and
its
embroidered
counterpane
than
that
of
a
man
who
had
made
a
vow
that
he
would
endeavor
to
gain
heaven
by
fasting
and
mortification
you
are
examining
my
den
said
aramis
ah
my
dear
fellow
excuse
me
i
am
lodged
like
a
chartreux
but
what
are
you
looking
for
i
am
looking
for
the
person
who
let
down
the
ladder
i
see
no
one
and
yet
the
ladder
didn
t
come
down
of
no
it
is
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
but
continued
aramis
bazin
is
a
well
trained
servant
and
seeing
that
i
was
not
alone
he
discreetly
retired
sit
down
my
dear
friend
and
let
us
and
aramis
pushed
forward
a
large
in
which
d
artagnan
stretched
himself
out
in
the
first
place
you
will
sup
with
me
will
you
not
asked
aramis
yes
if
you
really
wish
it
said
d
artagnan
and
even
with
great
pleasure
i
confess
the
journey
has
given
me
a
devil
of
an
ah
my
poor
friend
said
aramis
you
will
find
meagre
fare
you
were
not
am
i
then
threatened
with
the
omelet
of
crevecoeur
oh
let
us
hope
said
aramis
that
with
the
help
of
god
and
of
bazin
we
shall
find
something
better
than
that
in
the
larder
of
the
worthy
jesuit
fathers
bazin
my
friend
come
the
door
opened
and
bazin
entered
on
perceiving
the
musketeer
he
uttered
an
exclamation
that
was
almost
a
cry
of
despair
my
dear
bazin
said
d
artagnan
i
am
delighted
to
see
with
what
wonderful
composure
you
can
tell
a
lie
even
in
church
sir
replied
bazin
i
have
been
taught
by
the
good
jesuit
fathers
that
it
is
permitted
to
tell
a
falsehood
when
it
is
told
in
a
good
so
far
well
said
aramis
we
are
dying
of
hunger
serve
us
up
the
best
supper
you
can
and
especially
give
us
some
good
bazin
bowed
low
sighed
and
left
the
room
now
we
are
alone
dear
aramis
said
d
artagnan
tell
me
how
the
devil
you
managed
to
alight
upon
the
back
of
planchet
s
i
faith
answered
aramis
as
you
see
from
from
heaven
replied
d
artagnan
shaking
his
head
you
have
no
more
the
appearance
of
coming
from
thence
than
you
have
of
going
my
friend
said
aramis
with
a
look
of
imbecility
on
his
face
which
d
artagnan
had
never
observed
whilst
he
was
in
the
musketeers
if
i
did
not
come
from
heaven
at
least
i
was
leaving
paradise
which
is
almost
the
here
then
is
a
puzzle
for
the
learned
observed
d
artagnan
until
now
they
have
never
been
able
to
agree
as
to
the
situation
of
paradise
some
place
it
on
mount
ararat
others
between
the
rivers
tigris
and
euphrates
it
seems
that
they
have
been
looking
very
far
away
for
it
while
it
was
actually
very
near
paradise
is
at
noisy
le
sec
upon
the
site
of
the
archbishop
s
chateau
people
do
not
go
out
from
it
by
the
door
but
by
the
window
one
doesn
t
descend
here
by
the
marble
steps
of
a
peristyle
but
by
the
branches
of
a
and
the
angel
with
a
flaming
sword
who
guards
this
elysium
seems
to
have
changed
his
celestial
name
of
gabriel
into
that
of
the
more
terrestrial
one
of
the
prince
de
aramis
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
you
were
always
a
merry
companion
my
dear
d
artagnan
he
said
and
your
witty
gascon
fancy
has
not
deserted
you
yes
there
is
something
in
what
you
say
nevertheless
do
not
believe
that
it
is
madame
de
longueville
with
whom
i
am
in
a
plague
on
t
i
shall
not
do
so
after
having
been
so
long
in
love
with
madame
de
chevreuse
you
would
hardly
lay
your
heart
at
the
feet
of
her
mortal
enemy
yes
replied
aramis
with
an
absent
air
yes
that
poor
duchess
i
once
loved
her
much
and
to
do
her
justice
she
was
very
useful
to
us
eventually
she
was
obliged
to
leave
france
he
was
a
relentless
enemy
that
damned
cardinal
continued
aramis
glancing
at
the
portrait
of
the
old
minister
he
had
even
given
orders
to
arrest
her
and
would
have
cut
off
her
head
had
she
not
escaped
with
her
poor
kitty
i
have
heard
that
she
met
with
a
strange
adventure
in
i
don
t
know
what
village
with
i
don
t
know
what
cure
of
whom
she
asked
hospitality
and
who
having
but
one
chamber
and
taking
her
for
a
cavalier
offered
to
share
it
with
her
for
she
had
a
wonderful
way
of
dressing
as
a
man
that
dear
marie
i
know
only
one
other
woman
who
can
do
it
as
well
so
they
made
this
song
about
her
laboissiere
dis
you
know
it
don
t
you
no
sing
it
aramis
immediately
complied
and
sang
the
song
in
a
very
lively
manner
bravo
cried
d
artagnan
you
sing
charmingly
dear
aramis
i
do
not
perceive
that
singing
masses
has
spoiled
your
my
dear
d
artagnan
replied
aramis
you
understand
when
i
was
a
musketeer
i
mounted
guard
as
seldom
as
i
could
now
when
i
am
an
abbe
i
say
as
few
masses
as
i
can
but
to
return
to
our
which
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
or
the
duchess
de
longueville
have
i
not
already
told
you
that
there
is
nothing
between
me
and
the
duchess
de
longueville
little
flirtations
perhaps
and
that
s
all
no
i
spoke
of
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
did
you
see
her
after
her
return
from
brussels
after
the
king
s
death
yes
she
is
still
yes
said
aramis
i
saw
her
also
at
that
time
i
gave
her
good
advice
by
which
she
did
not
profit
i
ventured
to
tell
her
that
mazarin
was
the
lover
of
anne
of
austria
she
wouldn
t
believe
me
saying
that
she
knew
anne
of
austria
who
was
too
proud
to
love
such
a
worthless
coxcomb
after
that
she
plunged
into
the
cabal
headed
by
the
duke
of
beaufort
and
the
coxcomb
arrested
de
beaufort
and
banished
madame
de
you
know
resumed
d
artagnan
that
she
has
had
leave
to
return
to
france
yes
she
is
come
back
and
is
going
to
commit
some
fresh
folly
or
oh
but
this
time
perhaps
she
will
follow
your
oh
this
time
returned
aramis
i
haven
t
seen
her
she
is
much
in
that
respect
unlike
you
my
dear
aramis
for
you
are
still
the
same
you
have
still
your
beautiful
dark
hair
still
your
elegant
figure
still
your
feminine
hands
which
are
admirably
suited
to
a
yes
replied
aramis
i
am
extremely
careful
of
my
appearance
do
you
know
that
i
am
growing
old
i
am
nearly
mind
aramis
d
artagnan
smiled
as
he
spoke
since
we
are
together
again
let
us
agree
on
one
point
what
age
shall
we
be
in
future
how
formerly
i
was
your
junior
by
two
or
three
years
and
if
i
am
not
mistaken
i
am
turned
forty
years
indeed
then
tis
i
who
am
mistaken
for
you
have
always
been
a
good
chronologist
by
your
reckoning
i
must
be
at
least
the
devil
i
am
don
t
let
it
out
at
the
hotel
rambouillet
it
would
ruin
me
replied
the
abbe
don
t
be
afraid
said
d
artagnan
i
never
go
why
what
in
the
world
cried
aramis
is
that
animal
bazin
doing
bazin
hurry
up
there
you
rascal
we
are
mad
with
hunger
and
thirst
bazin
entered
at
that
moment
carrying
a
bottle
in
each
hand
at
last
said
aramis
we
are
ready
are
we
yes
monsieur
quite
ready
said
bazin
but
it
took
me
some
time
to
bring
up
all
the
because
you
always
think
you
have
on
your
shoulders
your
beadle
s
robe
and
spend
all
your
time
reading
your
breviary
but
i
give
you
warning
that
if
in
polishing
your
chapel
utensils
you
forget
how
to
brighten
up
my
sword
i
will
make
a
great
fire
of
your
blessed
images
and
will
see
that
you
are
roasted
on
bazin
scandalized
made
a
sign
of
the
cross
with
the
bottle
in
his
hand
d
artagnan
more
surprised
than
ever
at
the
tone
and
manners
of
the
abbe
d
herblay
which
contrasted
so
strongly
with
those
of
the
musketeer
aramis
remained
staring
with
eyes
at
the
face
of
his
friend
bazin
quickly
covered
the
table
with
a
damask
cloth
and
arranged
upon
it
so
many
things
gilded
perfumed
appetizing
that
d
artagnan
was
quite
overcome
but
you
expected
some
one
then
asked
the
officer
oh
said
aramis
i
always
try
to
be
prepared
and
then
i
knew
you
were
seeking
from
whom
from
master
bazin
to
be
sure
he
took
you
for
the
devil
my
dear
fellow
and
hastened
to
warn
me
of
the
danger
that
threatened
my
soul
if
i
should
meet
again
a
companion
so
wicked
as
an
officer
of
oh
monsieur
said
bazin
clasping
his
hands
supplicatingly
come
no
hypocrisy
you
know
that
i
don
t
like
it
you
will
do
much
better
to
open
the
window
and
let
down
some
bread
a
chicken
and
a
bottle
of
wine
to
your
friend
planchet
who
has
been
this
last
hour
killing
himself
clapping
his
planchet
in
fact
had
bedded
and
fed
his
horses
and
then
coming
back
under
the
window
had
repeated
two
or
three
times
the
signal
agreed
upon
bazin
obeyed
fastened
to
the
end
of
a
cord
the
three
articles
designated
and
let
them
down
to
planchet
who
then
went
satisfied
to
his
shed
now
to
supper
said
aramis
the
two
friends
sat
down
and
aramis
began
to
cut
up
fowls
partridges
and
hams
with
admirable
skill
the
deuce
cried
d
artagnan
do
you
live
in
this
way
always
yes
pretty
well
the
coadjutor
has
given
me
dispensations
from
fasting
on
the
jours
maigres
on
account
of
my
health
then
i
have
engaged
as
my
cook
the
cook
who
lived
with
lafollone
you
know
the
man
i
mean
the
friend
of
the
cardinal
and
the
famous
epicure
whose
grace
after
dinner
used
to
be
good
lord
do
me
the
favor
to
cause
me
to
digest
what
i
have
nevertheless
he
died
of
indigestion
in
spite
of
his
grace
said
d
artagnan
what
can
you
expect
replied
aramis
in
a
tone
of
resignation
every
man
that
s
born
must
fulfil
his
if
it
be
not
an
indelicate
question
resumed
d
artagnan
have
you
grown
rich
oh
heaven
no
i
make
about
twelve
thousand
francs
a
year
without
counting
a
little
benefice
of
a
thousand
crowns
the
prince
gave
and
how
do
you
make
your
twelve
thousand
francs
by
your
poems
no
i
have
given
up
poetry
except
now
and
then
to
write
a
drinking
song
some
gay
sonnet
or
some
innocent
epigram
i
compose
sermons
my
what
sermons
do
you
preach
them
no
i
sell
them
to
those
of
my
cloth
who
wish
to
become
great
ah
indeed
and
you
have
not
been
tempted
by
the
hopes
of
reputation
yourself
i
should
my
dear
d
artagnan
have
been
so
but
nature
said
when
i
am
in
the
pulpit
if
by
chance
a
pretty
woman
looks
at
me
i
look
at
her
again
if
she
smiles
i
smile
too
then
i
speak
at
random
instead
of
preaching
about
the
torments
of
hell
i
talk
of
the
joys
of
paradise
an
event
took
place
in
the
church
of
louis
au
marais
a
gentleman
laughed
in
my
face
i
stopped
short
to
tell
him
that
he
was
a
fool
the
congregation
went
out
to
get
stones
to
stone
me
with
but
whilst
they
were
away
i
found
means
to
conciliate
the
priests
who
were
present
so
that
my
foe
was
pelted
instead
of
me
tis
true
that
he
came
the
next
morning
to
my
house
thinking
that
he
had
to
do
with
an
abbe
like
all
other
and
what
was
the
end
of
the
affair
we
met
in
the
place
royale
egad
you
know
about
was
i
not
your
second
cried
d
artagnan
you
were
you
know
how
i
settled
the
did
he
die
i
don
t
know
but
at
all
events
i
gave
him
absolution
in
articulo
mortis
tis
enough
to
kill
the
body
without
killing
the
bazin
made
a
despairing
sign
which
meant
that
while
perhaps
he
approved
the
moral
he
altogether
disapproved
the
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
bazin
my
friend
said
aramis
you
don
t
seem
to
be
aware
that
i
can
see
you
in
that
mirror
and
you
forget
that
once
for
all
i
have
forbidden
all
signs
of
approbation
or
disapprobation
you
will
do
me
the
favor
to
bring
us
some
spanish
wine
and
then
to
withdraw
besides
my
friend
d
artagnan
has
something
to
say
to
me
privately
have
you
not
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
nodded
his
head
and
bazin
retired
after
placing
on
the
table
the
spanish
wine
the
two
friends
left
alone
remained
silent
face
to
face
aramis
seemed
to
await
a
comfortable
digestion
d
artagnan
to
be
preparing
his
exordium
each
of
them
when
the
other
was
not
looking
hazarded
a
sly
glance
it
was
aramis
who
broke
the
silence
what
are
you
thinking
of
d
artagnan
he
began
i
was
thinking
my
dear
old
friend
that
when
you
were
a
musketeer
you
turned
your
thoughts
incessantly
to
the
church
and
now
that
you
are
an
abbe
you
are
perpetually
longing
to
be
once
more
a
tis
true
man
as
you
know
said
aramis
is
a
strange
animal
made
up
of
contradictions
since
i
became
an
abbe
i
dream
of
nothing
but
that
is
apparent
in
your
surroundings
you
have
rapiers
here
of
every
form
and
to
suit
the
most
exacting
taste
do
you
still
fence
well
i
i
fence
as
well
as
you
did
in
the
old
time
better
still
perhaps
i
do
nothing
else
all
and
with
whom
with
an
excellent
that
we
have
what
here
yes
here
in
this
convent
my
dear
fellow
there
is
everything
in
a
jesuit
then
you
would
have
killed
monsieur
de
marsillac
if
he
had
come
alone
to
attack
you
instead
of
at
the
head
of
twenty
men
undoubtedly
said
aramis
and
even
at
the
head
of
his
twenty
men
if
i
could
have
drawn
without
being
god
pardon
me
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
i
believe
he
has
become
more
gascon
than
i
am
then
aloud
well
my
dear
aramis
do
you
ask
me
why
i
came
to
seek
you
no
i
have
not
asked
you
that
said
aramis
with
his
subtle
manner
but
i
have
expected
you
to
tell
well
i
sought
you
for
the
single
purpose
of
offering
you
a
chance
to
kill
monsieur
de
marsillac
whenever
you
please
prince
though
he
hold
on
wait
said
aramis
that
is
an
idea
of
which
i
invite
you
to
take
advantage
my
friend
let
us
see
with
your
thousand
crowns
from
the
abbey
and
the
twelve
thousand
francs
you
make
by
selling
sermons
are
you
rich
answer
i
i
am
as
poor
as
job
and
were
you
to
search
my
pockets
and
my
boxes
i
don
t
believe
you
would
find
a
hundred
peste
a
hundred
pistoles
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
he
calls
that
being
as
poor
as
job
if
i
had
them
i
should
think
myself
as
rich
as
then
aloud
are
you
ambitious
as
well
my
friend
i
bring
you
the
means
of
becoming
rich
powerful
and
free
to
do
whatever
you
the
shadow
of
a
cloud
passed
over
aramis
s
face
as
quickly
as
that
which
in
august
passes
over
the
field
of
grain
but
quick
as
it
was
it
did
not
escape
d
artagnan
s
observation
speak
on
said
aramis
one
question
first
do
you
take
any
interest
in
politics
a
gleam
of
light
shone
in
aramis
s
eyes
as
brief
as
the
shadow
that
had
passed
over
his
face
but
not
so
brief
but
that
it
was
seen
by
d
artagnan
no
aramis
replied
then
proposals
from
any
quarter
will
be
agreeable
to
you
since
for
the
moment
you
have
no
master
but
god
it
is
have
you
my
dear
aramis
thought
sometimes
of
those
happy
happy
happy
days
of
youth
we
passed
laughing
drinking
and
fighting
each
other
for
play
certainly
and
more
than
once
regretted
them
it
was
indeed
a
glorious
well
those
splendidly
wild
days
may
chance
to
come
again
i
am
commissioned
to
find
out
my
companions
and
i
began
by
you
who
were
the
very
soul
of
our
aramis
bowed
rather
with
respect
than
pleasure
at
the
compliment
to
meddle
in
politics
he
exclaimed
in
a
languid
voice
leaning
back
in
his
ah
dear
d
artagnan
see
how
regularly
i
live
and
how
easy
i
am
here
we
have
experienced
the
ingratitude
of
the
great
as
you
well
tis
true
replied
d
artagnan
yet
the
great
sometimes
repent
of
their
in
that
case
it
would
be
quite
another
thing
come
let
s
be
merciful
to
every
sinner
besides
you
are
right
in
another
respect
which
is
in
thinking
that
if
we
were
to
meddle
in
politics
there
could
not
be
a
better
time
than
the
how
can
you
know
that
you
who
never
interest
yourself
in
politics
ah
without
caring
about
them
myself
i
live
among
those
who
are
much
occupied
in
them
poet
as
i
am
i
am
intimate
with
sarazin
who
is
devoted
to
the
prince
de
conti
and
with
monsieur
de
who
since
the
death
of
cardinal
richelieu
is
of
all
parties
or
any
party
so
that
political
discussions
have
not
altogether
been
uninteresting
to
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
said
d
artagnan
now
my
dear
friend
look
upon
all
i
tell
you
as
merely
the
statement
of
a
monk
of
a
man
who
resembles
an
echo
repeating
simply
what
he
hears
i
understand
that
mazarin
is
at
this
very
moment
extremely
uneasy
as
to
the
state
of
affairs
that
his
orders
are
not
respected
like
those
of
our
former
bugbear
the
deceased
cardinal
whose
portrait
as
you
see
hangs
yonder
for
whatever
may
be
thought
of
him
it
must
be
allowed
that
richelieu
was
i
will
not
contradict
you
there
said
d
artagnan
my
first
impressions
were
favorable
to
the
minister
i
said
to
myself
that
a
minister
is
never
loved
but
that
with
the
genius
this
one
was
said
to
have
he
would
eventually
triumph
over
his
enemies
and
would
make
himself
feared
which
in
my
opinion
is
much
more
to
be
desired
than
to
be
loved
d
artagnan
made
a
sign
with
his
head
which
indicated
that
he
entirely
approved
that
doubtful
maxim
this
then
continued
aramis
was
my
first
opinion
but
as
i
am
very
ignorant
in
matters
of
this
kind
and
as
the
humility
which
i
profess
obliges
me
not
to
rest
on
my
own
judgment
but
to
ask
the
opinion
of
others
i
have
inquired
eh
my
friend
aramis
paused
well
what
asked
his
friend
well
i
must
mortify
myself
i
must
confess
that
i
was
mistaken
monsieur
de
mazarin
is
not
a
man
of
genius
as
i
thought
he
is
a
man
of
no
origin
once
a
servant
of
cardinal
bentivoglio
and
he
got
on
by
intrigue
he
is
an
upstart
a
man
of
no
name
who
will
only
be
the
tool
of
a
party
in
france
he
will
amass
wealth
he
will
injure
the
king
s
revenue
and
pay
to
himself
the
pensions
which
richelieu
paid
to
others
he
is
neither
a
gentleman
in
manner
nor
in
feeling
but
a
sort
of
buffoon
a
punchinello
a
pantaloon
do
you
know
him
i
do
hem
said
d
artagnan
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
ah
it
fills
me
with
pride
to
find
that
thanks
to
a
common
sort
of
penetration
with
which
i
am
endowed
i
am
approved
by
a
man
like
you
fresh
from
the
but
you
speak
of
him
not
of
his
party
his
it
is
true
the
queen
is
for
something
in
his
but
he
will
never
have
the
a
mere
a
child
who
will
be
of
age
in
four
years
then
he
has
neither
the
parliament
nor
the
people
with
him
they
represent
the
wealth
of
the
country
nor
the
nobles
nor
the
princes
who
are
the
military
power
of
d
artagnan
scratched
his
ear
he
was
forced
to
confess
to
himself
that
this
reasoning
was
not
only
comprehensive
but
just
you
see
my
poor
friend
that
i
am
sometimes
bereft
of
my
ordinary
thoughtfulness
perhaps
i
am
wrong
in
speaking
thus
to
you
who
have
evidently
a
leaning
to
i
cried
d
artagnan
not
in
the
you
spoke
of
a
did
i
i
was
wrong
then
no
i
said
what
you
say
there
is
a
crisis
at
hand
well
let
s
fly
the
feather
before
the
wind
let
us
join
with
that
side
to
which
the
wind
will
carry
it
and
resume
our
adventurous
life
we
were
once
four
valiant
knights
four
hearts
fondly
united
let
us
unite
again
not
our
hearts
which
have
never
been
severed
but
our
courage
and
our
fortunes
here
s
a
good
opportunity
for
getting
something
better
than
a
you
are
right
d
artagnan
i
held
a
similar
project
but
as
i
had
not
nor
ever
shall
have
your
fruitful
vigorous
imagination
the
idea
was
suggested
to
me
every
one
nowadays
wants
auxiliaries
propositions
have
been
made
to
me
and
i
confess
to
you
frankly
that
the
coadjutor
has
made
me
speak
monsieur
de
gondy
the
cardinal
s
enemy
no
the
king
s
friend
said
aramis
the
king
s
friend
you
understand
well
it
is
a
question
of
serving
the
king
the
gentleman
s
but
the
king
is
with
he
is
but
not
willingly
in
appearance
not
heart
and
that
is
exactly
the
snare
the
king
s
enemies
are
preparing
for
the
poor
ah
but
this
is
indeed
civil
war
which
you
propose
to
me
dear
war
for
the
yet
the
king
will
be
at
the
head
of
the
army
on
mazarin
s
but
his
heart
will
be
in
the
army
commanded
by
the
duc
de
monsieur
de
beaufort
he
is
at
did
i
say
monsieur
de
beaufort
monsieur
de
beaufort
or
another
monsieur
de
beaufort
or
monsieur
le
but
monsieur
le
prince
is
to
set
out
for
the
army
he
is
entirely
devoted
to
the
oh
oh
said
aramis
there
are
questions
between
them
at
this
very
moment
and
besides
if
it
is
not
the
prince
then
monsieur
de
gondy
but
monsieur
de
gondy
is
to
be
made
a
cardinal
they
are
soliciting
the
hat
for
and
are
there
no
cardinals
that
can
fight
come
now
recall
the
four
cardinals
that
at
the
head
of
armies
have
equalled
monsieur
de
guebriant
and
monsieur
de
but
a
humpbacked
general
under
the
cuirass
the
hump
will
not
be
seen
besides
remember
that
alexander
was
lame
and
hannibal
had
but
one
do
you
see
any
great
advantage
in
adhering
to
this
party
asked
d
artagnan
i
foresee
in
it
the
aid
of
powerful
with
the
enmity
of
the
counteracted
by
parliament
and
that
may
be
done
if
they
can
separate
the
king
from
his
that
may
be
done
said
aramis
never
cried
d
artagnan
you
aramis
know
anne
of
austria
better
than
i
do
do
you
think
she
will
ever
forget
that
her
son
is
her
safeguard
her
shield
the
pledge
for
her
dignity
for
her
fortune
and
her
life
should
she
forsake
mazarin
she
must
join
her
son
and
go
over
to
the
princes
side
but
you
know
better
than
i
do
that
there
are
certain
reasons
why
she
can
never
abandon
perhaps
you
are
right
said
aramis
thoughtfully
therefore
i
shall
not
pledge
to
them
or
to
us
do
you
mean
aramis
to
no
one
i
am
a
priest
resumed
aramis
what
have
i
to
do
with
politics
i
am
not
obliged
to
read
any
breviary
i
have
a
jolly
little
circle
of
witty
abbes
and
pretty
women
everything
goes
on
smoothly
so
certainly
dear
friend
i
shall
not
meddle
in
well
listen
my
dear
aramis
said
d
artagnan
your
philosophy
convinces
me
on
my
honor
i
don
t
know
what
devil
of
an
insect
stung
me
and
made
me
ambitious
i
have
a
post
by
which
i
live
at
the
death
of
monsieur
de
treville
who
is
old
i
may
be
a
captain
which
is
a
very
snug
berth
for
a
once
penniless
gascon
instead
of
running
after
adventures
i
shall
accept
an
invitation
from
porthos
i
shall
go
and
shoot
on
his
estate
you
know
he
has
estates
porthos
i
should
think
so
indeed
ten
leagues
of
wood
of
marsh
land
and
valleys
he
is
lord
of
the
hill
and
the
plain
and
is
now
carrying
on
a
suit
for
his
feudal
rights
against
the
bishop
of
noyon
good
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
that
s
what
i
wanted
to
know
porthos
is
in
then
aloud
and
he
has
taken
his
ancient
name
of
vallon
to
which
he
adds
that
of
bracieux
an
estate
which
has
been
a
barony
by
my
so
that
porthos
will
be
a
i
don
t
doubt
it
the
baroness
porthos
will
sound
particularly
and
the
two
friends
began
to
laugh
so
d
artagnan
resumed
you
will
not
become
a
partisan
of
mazarin
s
nor
you
of
the
prince
de
conde
no
let
us
belong
to
no
party
but
remain
friends
let
us
be
neither
cardinalists
nor
adieu
and
d
artagnan
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
to
old
times
he
said
yes
returned
aramis
unhappily
those
times
are
nonsense
they
will
return
said
d
artagnan
at
all
events
if
you
want
me
remember
the
rue
tiquetonne
hotel
de
la
and
i
shall
be
at
the
convent
of
jesuits
from
six
in
the
morning
to
eight
at
night
come
by
the
door
from
eight
in
the
evening
until
six
in
the
morning
come
in
by
the
adieu
dear
oh
i
can
t
let
you
go
so
i
will
go
with
and
he
took
his
sword
and
cloak
he
wants
to
be
sure
that
i
go
away
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
aramis
whistled
for
bazin
but
bazin
was
asleep
in
the
and
aramis
was
obliged
to
shake
him
by
the
ear
to
awake
him
bazin
stretched
his
arms
rubbed
his
eyes
and
tried
to
go
to
sleep
again
come
come
sleepy
head
quick
the
ladder
but
said
bazin
yawning
portentously
the
ladder
is
still
at
the
the
other
one
the
gardener
s
didn
t
you
see
that
monsieur
d
artagnan
mounted
with
difficulty
it
will
be
even
more
difficult
to
d
artagnan
was
about
to
assure
aramis
that
he
could
descend
easily
when
an
idea
came
into
his
head
which
silenced
him
bazin
uttered
a
profound
sigh
and
went
out
to
look
for
the
ladder
presently
a
good
solid
wooden
ladder
was
placed
against
the
window
now
then
said
d
artagnan
this
is
something
like
this
is
a
means
of
communication
a
woman
could
go
up
a
ladder
like
aramis
s
searching
look
seemed
to
seek
his
friend
s
thought
even
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
but
d
artagnan
sustained
the
inquisition
with
an
air
of
admirable
simplicity
besides
at
that
moment
he
put
his
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
ladder
and
began
his
descent
in
a
moment
he
was
on
the
ground
bazin
remained
at
the
window
stay
there
said
aramis
i
shall
return
the
two
friends
went
toward
the
shed
at
their
approach
planchet
came
out
leading
the
two
horses
that
is
good
to
see
said
aramis
there
is
a
servant
active
and
vigilant
not
like
that
lazy
fellow
bazin
who
is
no
longer
good
for
anything
since
he
became
connected
with
the
church
follow
us
planchet
we
shall
continue
our
conversation
to
the
end
of
the
they
traversed
the
width
of
the
village
talking
of
indifferent
things
then
as
they
reached
the
last
houses
go
then
dear
friend
said
aramis
follow
your
own
career
fortune
lavishes
her
smiles
upon
you
do
not
let
her
flee
from
your
embrace
as
for
me
i
remain
in
my
humility
and
indolence
adieu
thus
tis
quite
decided
said
d
artagnan
that
what
i
have
to
offer
to
you
does
not
tempt
you
on
the
contrary
it
would
tempt
me
were
i
any
other
man
rejoined
aramis
but
i
repeat
i
am
made
up
of
contradictions
what
i
hate
i
adore
and
vice
versa
you
see
that
i
can
not
like
you
for
instance
settle
on
any
fixed
thou
liest
subtile
one
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
thou
alone
on
the
contrary
knowest
how
to
choose
thy
object
and
to
gain
it
the
friends
embraced
they
descended
into
the
plain
by
the
ladder
planchet
met
them
hard
by
the
shed
d
artagnan
jumped
into
the
saddle
then
the
old
companions
in
arms
again
shook
hands
d
artagnan
and
planchet
spurred
their
steeds
and
took
the
road
to
paris
but
after
he
had
gone
about
two
hundred
steps
d
artagnan
stopped
short
alighted
threw
the
bridle
of
his
horse
over
the
arm
of
planchet
and
took
the
pistols
from
his
to
fasten
them
to
his
girdle
what
s
the
matter
asked
planchet
this
is
the
matter
be
he
ever
so
cunning
he
shall
never
say
i
was
his
dupe
stand
here
don
t
stir
turn
your
back
to
the
road
and
wait
for
having
thus
spoken
d
artagnan
cleared
the
ditch
by
the
roadside
and
crossed
the
plain
so
as
to
wind
around
the
village
he
had
observed
between
the
house
that
madame
de
longueville
inhabited
and
the
convent
of
the
jesuits
an
open
space
surrounded
by
a
hedge
the
moon
had
now
risen
and
he
could
see
well
enough
to
retrace
his
road
he
reached
the
hedge
and
hid
himself
behind
it
in
passing
by
the
house
where
the
scene
which
we
have
related
took
place
he
remarked
that
the
window
was
again
lighted
up
and
he
was
convinced
that
aramis
had
not
yet
returned
to
his
own
apartment
and
that
when
he
did
it
would
not
be
alone
in
truth
in
a
few
minutes
he
heard
steps
approaching
and
low
whispers
close
to
the
hedge
the
steps
stopped
d
artagnan
knelt
down
near
the
thickest
part
of
the
hedge
two
men
to
the
astonishment
of
d
artagnan
appeared
shortly
soon
however
his
surprise
vanished
for
he
heard
the
murmurs
of
a
soft
harmonious
voice
one
of
these
two
men
was
a
woman
disguised
as
a
cavalier
calm
yourself
dear
rene
said
the
soft
voice
the
same
thing
will
never
happen
again
i
have
discovered
a
sort
of
subterranean
passage
which
runs
beneath
the
street
and
we
shall
only
have
to
raise
one
of
the
marble
slabs
before
the
door
to
open
you
an
entrance
and
an
oh
answered
another
voice
which
d
artagnan
instantly
recognized
as
that
of
aramis
i
swear
to
you
princess
that
if
your
reputation
did
not
depend
on
precautions
and
if
my
life
alone
were
jeopardized
yes
yes
i
know
you
are
as
brave
and
venturesome
as
any
man
in
the
world
but
you
do
not
belong
to
me
alone
you
belong
to
all
our
party
be
prudent
sensible
i
always
obey
madame
when
i
am
commanded
by
so
gentle
a
he
kissed
her
hand
tenderly
ah
exclaimed
the
cavalier
with
a
soft
voice
what
s
the
matter
asked
aramis
do
you
not
see
that
the
wind
has
blown
off
my
hat
aramis
rushed
after
the
fugitive
hat
d
artagnan
took
advantage
of
the
circumstance
to
find
a
place
in
the
hedge
not
so
thick
where
his
glance
could
penetrate
to
the
supposed
cavalier
at
that
instant
the
moon
inquisitive
perhaps
like
d
artagnan
came
from
behind
a
cloud
and
by
her
light
d
artagnan
recognized
the
large
blue
eyes
the
golden
hair
and
the
classic
head
of
the
duchess
de
longueville
aramis
returned
laughing
one
hat
on
his
head
and
the
other
in
his
hand
and
he
and
his
companion
resumed
their
walk
toward
the
convent
good
said
d
artagnan
rising
and
brushing
his
knees
now
i
have
thee
thou
art
a
frondeur
and
the
lover
of
madame
de
monsieur
porthos
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
thanks
to
what
aramis
had
told
him
d
artagnan
who
knew
already
that
porthos
called
himself
du
vallon
was
now
aware
that
he
styled
himself
from
his
estate
de
bracieux
and
that
he
was
on
account
of
this
estate
engaged
in
a
lawsuit
with
the
bishop
of
noyon
it
was
then
in
the
neighborhood
of
noyon
that
he
must
seek
that
estate
his
itinerary
was
promptly
determined
he
would
go
to
dammartin
from
which
place
two
roads
diverge
one
toward
soissons
the
other
toward
compiegne
there
he
would
inquire
concerning
the
bracieux
estate
and
go
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
according
to
the
information
obtained
planchet
who
was
still
a
little
concerned
for
his
safety
after
his
recent
escapade
declared
that
he
would
follow
d
artagnan
even
to
the
end
of
the
world
either
by
the
road
to
the
right
or
by
that
to
the
left
only
he
begged
his
former
master
to
set
out
in
the
evening
for
greater
security
to
himself
d
artagnan
suggested
that
he
should
send
word
to
his
wife
so
that
she
might
not
be
anxious
about
him
but
planchet
replied
with
much
sagacity
that
he
was
very
sure
his
wife
would
not
die
of
anxiety
through
not
knowing
where
he
was
while
he
planchet
remembering
her
incontinence
of
tongue
would
die
of
anxiety
if
she
did
know
this
reasoning
seemed
to
d
artagnan
so
satisfactory
that
he
no
further
insisted
and
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
time
when
the
vapors
of
night
begin
to
thicken
in
the
streets
he
left
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
and
followed
by
planchet
set
forth
from
the
capital
by
way
of
the
saint
denis
gate
at
midnight
the
two
travelers
were
at
dammartin
but
it
was
then
too
late
to
make
inquiries
the
host
of
the
cygne
de
la
croix
had
gone
to
bed
the
next
morning
d
artagnan
summoned
the
host
one
of
those
sly
normans
who
say
neither
yes
nor
no
and
fear
to
commit
themselves
by
giving
a
direct
answer
d
artagnan
however
gathered
from
his
equivocal
replies
that
the
road
to
the
right
was
the
one
he
ought
to
take
and
on
that
uncertain
information
he
resumed
his
journey
at
nine
in
the
morning
he
reached
nanteuil
and
stopped
for
breakfast
his
host
here
was
a
good
fellow
from
picardy
who
gave
him
all
the
information
he
needed
the
bracieux
estate
was
a
few
leagues
from
d
artagnan
was
acquainted
with
having
gone
thither
with
the
court
on
several
occasions
for
at
that
time
was
a
royal
residence
he
therefore
shaped
his
course
toward
that
place
and
dismounted
at
the
dauphin
d
or
there
he
ascertained
that
the
bracieux
estate
was
four
leagues
distant
but
that
porthos
was
not
at
bracieux
porthos
had
in
fact
been
involved
in
a
dispute
with
the
bishop
of
noyon
in
regard
to
the
pierrefonds
property
which
adjoined
his
own
and
weary
at
length
of
a
legal
controversy
which
was
beyond
his
comprehension
he
put
an
end
to
it
by
purchasing
pierrefonds
and
added
that
name
to
his
others
he
now
called
himself
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
and
resided
on
his
new
estate
the
travelers
were
therefore
obliged
to
stay
at
the
hotel
until
the
next
day
the
horses
had
done
ten
leagues
that
day
and
needed
rest
it
is
true
they
might
have
taken
others
but
there
was
a
great
forest
to
pass
through
and
planchet
as
we
have
seen
had
no
liking
for
forests
after
dark
there
was
another
thing
that
planchet
had
no
liking
for
and
that
was
starting
on
a
journey
with
a
hungry
stomach
accordingly
d
artagnan
on
awaking
found
his
breakfast
waiting
for
him
it
need
not
be
said
that
planchet
in
resuming
his
former
functions
resumed
also
his
former
humility
and
was
not
ashamed
to
make
his
breakfast
on
what
was
left
by
d
artagnan
it
was
nearly
eight
o
clock
when
they
set
out
again
their
course
was
clearly
defined
they
were
to
follow
the
road
toward
compiegne
and
on
emerging
from
the
forest
turn
to
the
right
the
morning
was
beautiful
and
in
this
early
springtime
the
birds
sang
on
the
trees
and
the
sunbeams
shone
through
the
misty
glades
like
curtains
of
golden
gauze
in
other
parts
of
the
forest
the
light
could
scarcely
penetrate
through
the
foliage
and
the
stems
of
two
old
oak
trees
the
refuge
of
the
squirrel
startled
by
the
travelers
were
in
deep
shadow
there
came
up
from
all
nature
in
the
dawn
of
day
a
perfume
of
herbs
flowers
and
leaves
which
delighted
the
heart
d
artagnan
sick
of
the
closeness
of
paris
thought
that
when
a
man
had
three
names
of
his
different
estates
joined
one
to
another
he
ought
to
be
very
happy
in
such
a
paradise
then
he
shook
his
head
saying
if
i
were
porthos
and
d
artagnan
came
to
make
me
such
a
proposition
as
i
am
going
to
make
to
him
i
know
what
i
should
say
to
as
to
planchet
he
thought
of
little
or
nothing
but
was
happy
as
a
in
his
old
master
s
company
at
the
extremity
of
the
wood
d
artagnan
perceived
the
road
that
had
been
described
to
him
and
at
the
end
of
the
road
he
saw
the
towers
of
an
immense
feudal
castle
oh
oh
he
said
i
fancied
this
castle
belonged
to
the
ancient
branch
of
orleans
can
porthos
have
negotiated
for
it
with
the
duc
de
longueville
faith
exclaimed
planchet
here
s
land
in
good
condition
if
it
belongs
to
monsieur
porthos
i
wish
him
zounds
cried
d
artagnan
don
t
call
him
porthos
nor
even
vallon
call
him
de
bracieux
or
de
pierrefonds
thou
wilt
knell
out
damnation
to
my
mission
as
he
approached
the
castle
which
had
first
attracted
his
eye
d
artagnan
was
convinced
that
it
could
not
be
there
that
his
friend
dwelt
the
towers
though
solid
and
as
if
built
yesterday
were
open
and
broken
one
might
have
fancied
that
some
giant
had
cleaved
them
with
blows
from
a
hatchet
on
arriving
at
the
extremity
of
the
castle
d
artagnan
found
himself
overlooking
a
beautiful
valley
in
which
at
the
foot
of
a
charming
little
lake
stood
several
scattered
houses
which
humble
in
their
aspect
and
covered
some
with
tiles
others
with
thatch
seemed
to
acknowledge
as
their
sovereign
lord
a
pretty
chateau
built
about
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
henry
and
surmounted
by
four
stately
gilded
d
artagnan
no
longer
doubted
that
this
was
porthos
s
pleasant
dwelling
place
the
road
led
straight
up
to
the
chateau
which
compared
to
its
ancestor
on
the
hill
was
exactly
what
a
fop
of
the
coterie
of
the
duc
d
enghein
would
have
been
beside
a
knight
in
steel
armor
in
the
time
of
charles
vii
d
artagnan
spurred
his
horse
on
and
pursued
his
road
followed
by
planchet
at
the
same
pace
in
ten
minutes
d
artagnan
reached
the
end
of
an
alley
regularly
planted
with
fine
poplars
and
terminating
in
an
iron
gate
the
points
and
crossed
bars
of
which
were
gilt
in
the
midst
of
this
avenue
was
a
nobleman
dressed
in
green
and
with
as
much
gilding
about
him
as
the
iron
gate
riding
on
a
tall
horse
on
his
right
hand
and
his
left
were
two
footmen
with
the
seams
of
their
dresses
laced
a
considerable
number
of
clowns
were
assembled
and
rendered
homage
to
their
lord
ah
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
can
this
be
the
seigneur
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
how
he
has
shrunk
since
he
gave
up
the
name
of
porthos
this
can
not
be
monsieur
porthos
observed
planchet
replying
as
it
were
to
his
master
s
thoughts
monsieur
porthos
was
six
feet
high
this
man
is
scarcely
nevertheless
said
d
artagnan
the
people
are
bowing
very
low
to
this
as
he
spoke
he
rode
toward
the
tall
horse
to
the
man
of
importance
and
his
valets
as
he
approached
he
seemed
to
recognize
the
features
of
this
individual
jesu
cried
planchet
can
it
be
at
this
exclamation
the
man
on
horseback
turned
slowly
and
with
a
lofty
air
and
the
two
travelers
could
see
displayed
in
all
their
brilliancy
the
large
eyes
the
vermilion
visage
and
the
eloquent
smile
of
mousqueton
it
was
indeed
mousqueton
mousqueton
as
fat
as
a
pig
rolling
about
with
rude
health
puffed
out
with
good
living
who
recognizing
d
artagnan
and
acting
very
differently
from
the
hypocrite
bazin
slipped
off
his
horse
and
approached
the
officer
with
his
hat
off
so
that
the
homage
of
the
assembled
crowd
was
turned
toward
this
new
sun
which
eclipsed
the
former
luminary
monsieur
d
artagnan
monsieur
d
artagnan
cried
mousqueton
his
fat
cheeks
swelling
out
and
his
whole
frame
perspiring
with
joy
monsieur
d
artagnan
oh
what
joy
for
my
lord
and
master
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
thou
good
mousqueton
where
is
thy
master
you
stand
upon
his
property
but
how
handsome
thou
art
how
fat
thou
hast
prospered
and
grown
stout
and
d
artagnan
could
not
restrain
his
astonishment
at
the
change
good
fortune
had
produced
on
the
once
famished
one
hey
yes
thank
god
i
am
pretty
well
said
mousqueton
but
hast
thou
nothing
to
say
to
thy
friend
planchet
how
my
friend
planchet
planchet
art
thou
there
cried
mousqueton
with
open
arms
and
eyes
full
of
tears
my
very
self
replied
planchet
but
i
wanted
first
to
see
if
thou
wert
grown
proud
toward
an
old
friend
never
planchet
thou
wouldst
not
have
thought
so
hadst
thou
known
mousqueton
so
far
so
well
answered
planchet
alighting
and
extending
his
arms
to
mousqueton
the
two
servants
embraced
with
an
emotion
which
touched
those
who
were
present
and
made
them
suppose
that
planchet
was
a
great
lord
in
disguise
so
highly
did
they
estimate
the
position
of
mousqueton
and
now
sir
resumed
mousqueton
when
he
had
rid
himself
of
planchet
who
had
in
vain
tried
to
clasp
his
hands
behind
his
friend
s
fat
back
now
sir
allow
me
to
leave
you
for
i
could
not
permit
my
master
to
hear
of
your
arrival
from
any
but
myself
he
would
never
forgive
me
for
not
having
preceded
this
dear
friend
said
d
artagnan
carefully
avoiding
to
utter
either
the
former
name
borne
by
porthos
or
his
new
one
then
he
has
not
forgotten
me
forgotten
he
cried
mousqueton
there
s
not
a
day
sir
that
we
don
t
expect
to
hear
that
you
were
made
marshal
either
instead
of
monsieur
de
gassion
or
of
monsieur
de
on
d
artagnan
s
lips
there
played
one
of
those
rare
and
melancholy
smiles
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
the
depth
of
his
soul
the
last
trace
of
youth
and
happiness
that
had
survived
life
s
disillusions
and
you
fellows
resumed
mousqueton
stay
near
monsieur
le
comte
d
artagnan
and
pay
him
every
attention
in
your
power
whilst
i
go
to
prepare
my
lord
for
his
and
mounting
his
horse
mousqueton
rode
off
down
the
avenue
on
the
grass
at
a
hand
gallop
ah
there
there
s
something
promising
said
d
artagnan
no
mysteries
no
cloak
to
hide
one
s
self
in
no
cunning
policy
here
people
laugh
outright
they
weep
for
joy
here
i
see
nothing
but
faces
a
yard
broad
in
short
it
seems
to
me
that
nature
herself
wears
a
holiday
garb
and
that
the
trees
instead
of
leaves
and
flowers
are
covered
with
red
and
green
ribbons
as
on
gala
as
for
me
said
planchet
i
seem
to
smell
from
this
place
even
a
most
delectable
perfume
of
fine
roast
meat
and
to
see
the
scullions
in
a
row
by
the
hedge
hailing
our
approach
ah
sir
what
a
cook
must
monsieur
pierrefonds
have
when
he
was
so
fond
of
eating
and
drinking
even
whilst
he
was
only
called
monsieur
porthos
say
no
more
cried
d
artagnan
if
the
reality
corresponds
with
appearances
i
am
lost
for
a
man
so
well
off
will
never
change
his
happy
condition
and
i
shall
fail
with
him
as
i
have
already
done
with
wealth
does
not
necessarily
produce
happiness
d
artagnan
passed
through
the
iron
gate
and
arrived
in
front
of
the
chateau
he
alighted
as
he
saw
a
species
of
giant
on
the
steps
let
us
do
justice
to
d
artagnan
independently
of
every
selfish
wish
his
heart
palpitated
with
joy
when
he
saw
that
tall
form
and
martial
demeanor
which
recalled
to
him
a
good
and
brave
man
he
ran
to
porthos
and
threw
himself
into
his
arms
the
whole
body
of
servants
arranged
in
a
at
a
respectful
distance
looked
on
with
humble
curiosity
mousqueton
at
the
head
of
them
wiped
his
eyes
porthos
linked
his
arm
in
that
of
his
friend
ah
how
delightful
to
see
you
again
dear
friend
he
cried
in
a
voice
which
was
now
changed
from
a
baritone
into
a
bass
you
ve
not
then
forgotten
me
forget
you
oh
dear
du
vallon
does
one
forget
the
happiest
days
of
flowery
youth
one
s
dearest
friends
the
dangers
we
have
dared
together
on
the
contrary
there
is
not
an
hour
we
have
passed
together
that
is
not
present
to
my
yes
yes
said
porthos
trying
to
give
to
his
mustache
a
curl
which
it
had
lost
whilst
he
had
been
alone
yes
we
did
some
fine
things
in
our
time
and
we
gave
that
poor
cardinal
a
few
threads
to
and
he
heaved
a
sigh
under
any
circumstances
he
resumed
you
are
welcome
my
dear
friend
you
will
help
me
to
recover
my
spirits
we
will
hunt
the
hare
on
my
plain
which
is
a
superb
tract
of
land
or
pursue
the
deer
in
my
woods
which
are
magnificent
i
have
four
harriers
which
are
considered
the
swiftest
in
the
county
and
a
pack
of
hounds
which
are
unequalled
for
twenty
leagues
and
porthos
heaved
another
sigh
but
first
interposed
d
artagnan
you
must
present
me
to
madame
du
a
third
sigh
from
porthos
i
lost
madame
du
vallon
two
years
ago
he
said
and
you
find
me
still
in
affliction
on
that
account
that
was
the
reason
why
i
left
my
chateau
du
vallon
near
corbeil
and
came
to
my
estate
bracieux
poor
madame
du
vallon
her
temper
was
uncertain
but
she
came
at
last
to
accustom
herself
to
my
little
ways
and
understand
my
little
so
you
are
free
now
and
rich
alas
groaned
porthos
i
am
a
widower
and
have
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
let
us
go
to
i
shall
be
happy
to
do
so
the
morning
air
has
made
me
yes
said
porthos
my
air
is
they
went
into
the
chateau
there
was
nothing
but
gilding
high
and
low
the
cornices
were
gilt
the
mouldings
were
gilt
the
legs
and
arms
of
the
chairs
were
gilt
a
table
ready
set
out
awaited
them
you
see
said
porthos
this
is
my
usual
devil
take
me
answered
d
artagnan
i
wish
you
joy
of
it
the
king
has
nothing
like
no
answered
porthos
i
hear
it
said
that
he
is
very
badly
fed
by
the
cardinal
monsieur
de
mazarin
taste
this
cutlet
my
dear
d
artagnan
tis
off
one
of
my
you
have
very
tender
mutton
and
i
wish
you
joy
of
said
d
artagnan
yes
the
sheep
are
fed
in
my
meadows
which
are
excellent
give
me
another
no
try
this
hare
which
i
had
killed
yesterday
in
one
of
my
zounds
what
a
flavor
cried
d
artagnan
ah
they
are
fed
on
thyme
only
your
and
how
do
you
like
my
wine
asked
porthos
it
is
pleasant
isn
t
it
capital
it
is
nothing
however
but
a
wine
of
the
really
yes
a
small
declivity
to
the
south
yonder
on
my
hill
gives
me
twenty
quite
a
vineyard
hey
porthos
sighed
for
the
fifth
time
d
artagnan
had
counted
his
sighs
he
became
curious
to
solve
the
problem
well
now
he
said
it
seems
my
dear
friend
that
something
vexes
you
you
are
ill
perhaps
that
health
which
excellent
my
dear
friend
better
than
ever
i
could
kill
an
ox
with
a
blow
of
my
well
then
family
affairs
perhaps
family
i
have
happily
only
myself
in
the
world
to
care
but
what
makes
you
sigh
my
dear
fellow
replied
porthos
to
be
candid
with
you
i
am
not
you
are
not
happy
porthos
you
who
have
chateau
meadows
mountains
woods
you
who
have
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
you
are
not
happy
my
dear
friend
all
those
things
i
have
but
i
am
a
hermit
in
the
midst
of
surrounded
i
suppose
only
by
clodhoppers
with
whom
you
could
not
porthos
turned
rather
pale
and
drank
off
a
large
glass
of
wine
no
but
just
think
there
are
paltry
country
squires
who
have
all
some
title
or
another
and
pretend
to
go
back
as
far
as
charlemagne
or
at
least
to
hugh
capet
when
i
first
came
here
being
the
last
comer
it
was
for
me
to
make
the
first
advances
i
made
them
but
you
know
my
dear
friend
madame
du
vallon
porthos
in
pronouncing
these
words
seemed
to
gulp
down
something
madame
du
vallon
was
of
doubtful
gentility
she
had
in
her
first
marriage
i
don
t
think
d
artagnan
i
am
telling
you
anything
new
married
a
lawyer
they
thought
that
nauseous
you
can
understand
that
s
a
word
bad
enough
to
make
one
kill
thirty
thousand
men
i
have
killed
two
which
has
made
people
hold
their
tongues
but
has
not
made
me
their
friend
so
that
i
have
no
society
i
live
alone
i
am
sick
of
it
my
mind
preys
on
d
artagnan
smiled
he
now
saw
where
the
breastplate
was
weak
and
prepared
the
blow
but
now
he
said
that
you
are
a
widower
your
wife
s
connection
can
not
injure
yes
but
understand
me
not
being
of
a
race
of
historic
fame
like
the
de
courcys
who
were
content
to
be
plain
sirs
or
the
rohans
who
didn
t
wish
to
be
dukes
all
these
people
who
are
all
either
vicomtes
or
comtes
go
before
me
at
church
in
all
the
ceremonies
and
i
can
say
nothing
to
them
ah
if
i
only
were
a
a
baron
don
t
you
mean
cried
d
artagnan
finishing
his
friend
s
sentence
ah
cried
porthos
would
i
were
but
a
baron
well
my
friend
i
am
come
to
give
you
this
very
title
which
you
wish
for
so
porthos
gave
a
start
that
shook
the
room
two
or
three
bottles
fell
and
were
broken
mousqueton
ran
thither
hearing
the
noise
porthos
waved
his
hand
to
mousqueton
to
pick
up
the
bottles
i
am
glad
to
see
said
d
artagnan
that
you
have
still
that
honest
lad
with
he
is
my
steward
replied
porthos
he
will
never
leave
me
go
away
now
so
he
s
called
mouston
thought
d
artagnan
tis
too
long
a
word
to
pronounce
well
he
said
aloud
let
us
resume
our
conversation
later
your
people
may
suspect
something
there
may
be
spies
about
you
can
suppose
porthos
that
what
i
have
to
say
relates
to
most
important
devil
take
them
let
us
walk
in
the
park
answered
porthos
for
the
sake
of
egad
said
d
artagnan
the
park
is
like
everything
else
and
there
are
as
many
fish
in
your
pond
as
rabbits
in
your
warren
you
are
a
happy
man
my
friend
since
you
have
not
only
retained
your
love
of
the
chase
but
acquired
that
of
my
friend
replied
porthos
i
leave
fishing
to
mousqueton
it
is
a
vulgar
pleasure
but
i
shoot
sometimes
that
is
to
say
when
i
am
dull
and
i
sit
on
one
of
those
marble
seats
have
my
gun
brought
to
me
my
favorite
dog
and
i
shoot
really
how
very
amusing
yes
replied
porthos
with
a
sigh
it
is
d
artagnan
now
no
longer
counted
the
sighs
they
were
innumerable
however
what
had
you
to
say
to
me
he
resumed
let
us
return
to
that
with
pleasure
replied
d
artagnan
i
must
however
first
frankly
tell
you
that
you
must
change
your
mode
of
how
go
into
harness
again
gird
on
your
sword
run
after
adventures
and
leave
as
in
old
times
a
little
of
your
fat
on
the
ah
hang
it
said
porthos
i
see
you
are
spoiled
dear
friend
you
are
corpulent
your
arm
has
no
longer
that
movement
of
which
the
late
cardinal
s
guards
have
so
many
ah
my
fist
is
strong
enough
i
swear
cried
porthos
extending
a
hand
like
a
shoulder
of
mutton
so
much
the
are
we
then
to
go
to
war
by
my
troth
against
whom
are
you
a
politician
friend
not
in
the
are
you
for
mazarin
or
for
the
princes
i
am
for
no
that
is
to
say
you
are
for
us
well
i
tell
you
that
i
come
to
you
from
the
this
speech
was
heard
by
porthos
in
the
same
sense
as
if
it
had
still
been
in
the
year
and
related
to
the
true
cardinal
ho
ho
what
are
the
wishes
of
his
eminence
he
wishes
to
have
you
in
his
and
who
spoke
to
him
of
me
rochefort
you
remember
him
yes
pardieu
it
was
he
who
gave
us
so
much
trouble
and
kept
us
on
the
road
so
much
you
gave
him
three
in
three
separate
but
you
know
he
is
now
our
friend
no
i
didn
t
know
that
so
he
cherishes
no
resentment
you
are
mistaken
porthos
said
d
artagnan
it
is
i
who
cherish
no
porthos
didn
t
understand
any
too
clearly
but
then
we
know
that
understanding
was
not
his
strong
point
you
say
then
he
continued
that
the
count
de
rochefort
spoke
of
me
to
the
cardinal
yes
and
the
queen
the
queen
do
you
say
to
inspire
us
with
confidence
she
has
even
placed
in
mazarin
s
hands
that
famous
diamond
you
remember
all
about
it
that
i
once
sold
to
monsieur
des
essarts
and
of
which
i
don
t
know
how
she
has
regained
but
it
seems
to
me
said
porthos
that
she
would
have
done
much
better
if
she
had
given
it
back
to
so
i
think
replied
d
artagnan
but
kings
and
queens
are
strange
beings
and
have
odd
fancies
nevertheless
since
they
are
the
ones
who
have
riches
and
honors
we
are
devoted
to
yes
we
are
devoted
to
them
repeated
porthos
and
you
to
whom
are
you
devoted
now
to
the
king
the
queen
and
to
the
cardinal
moreover
i
have
answered
for
your
devotion
and
you
say
that
you
have
made
certain
conditions
on
my
behalf
magnificent
my
dear
fellow
magnificent
in
the
first
place
you
have
plenty
of
money
haven
t
you
forty
thousand
francs
income
i
think
you
porthos
began
to
be
suspicious
eh
my
friend
said
he
one
never
has
too
much
money
madame
du
vallon
left
things
in
much
disorder
i
am
not
much
of
a
hand
at
figures
so
that
i
live
almost
from
hand
to
he
is
afraid
i
have
come
to
borrow
money
thought
d
artagnan
ah
my
friend
said
he
it
is
all
the
better
if
you
are
in
how
is
it
all
the
better
yes
for
his
eminence
will
give
you
all
that
you
want
land
money
and
ah
ah
ah
said
porthos
opening
his
eyes
at
that
last
word
under
the
other
cardinal
continued
d
artagnan
we
didn
t
know
enough
to
make
our
profits
this
however
doesn
t
concern
you
with
your
forty
thousand
francs
income
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
it
seems
to
porthos
sighed
at
the
same
time
continued
d
artagnan
notwithstanding
your
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
perhaps
even
for
the
very
reason
that
you
have
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
it
seems
to
me
that
a
little
coronet
would
do
well
on
your
carriage
hey
yes
indeed
said
porthos
well
my
dear
friend
win
it
it
is
at
the
point
of
your
sword
we
shall
not
interfere
with
each
other
your
object
is
a
title
mine
money
if
i
can
get
enough
to
rebuild
artagnan
which
my
ancestors
impoverished
by
the
crusades
allowed
to
fall
into
ruins
and
to
buy
thirty
acres
of
land
about
it
that
is
all
i
wish
i
shall
retire
and
die
tranquilly
at
for
my
part
said
porthos
i
desire
to
be
made
a
you
shall
be
and
have
you
not
seen
any
of
our
other
friends
yes
i
have
seen
and
what
does
he
wish
to
be
a
bishop
aramis
answered
d
artagnan
who
did
not
wish
to
undeceive
porthos
aramis
fancy
has
become
a
monk
and
a
jesuit
and
lives
like
a
bear
my
offers
did
not
arouse
him
did
not
even
tempt
so
much
the
worse
he
was
a
clever
man
and
athos
i
have
not
yet
seen
him
do
you
know
where
i
shall
find
him
near
blois
he
is
called
bragelonne
only
imagine
my
dear
friend
athos
who
was
of
as
high
birth
as
the
emperor
and
who
inherits
one
estate
which
gives
him
the
title
of
comte
what
is
he
to
do
with
all
those
dignities
the
comte
de
la
fere
comte
de
bragelonne
and
he
has
no
children
with
all
these
titles
ah
said
porthos
i
have
heard
that
he
had
adopted
a
young
man
who
resembles
him
what
athos
our
athos
who
was
as
virtuous
as
scipio
have
you
seen
him
well
i
shall
see
him
and
tell
him
about
you
but
i
m
afraid
entre
nous
that
his
liking
for
wine
has
aged
and
degraded
yes
he
used
to
drink
a
great
deal
replied
porthos
and
then
he
was
older
than
any
of
us
added
d
artagnan
some
years
only
his
gravity
made
him
look
older
than
he
well
then
if
we
can
get
athos
all
will
be
well
if
we
can
not
we
will
do
without
him
we
two
are
worth
a
yes
said
porthos
smiling
at
the
remembrance
of
his
former
exploits
but
we
four
altogether
would
be
equal
to
more
especially
as
you
say
the
work
will
not
be
child
s
play
will
it
last
long
by
r
lady
two
or
three
years
so
much
the
better
cried
porthos
you
have
no
idea
my
friend
how
my
bones
ache
since
i
came
here
sometimes
on
a
sunday
i
take
a
ride
in
the
fields
and
on
the
property
of
my
neighbours
in
order
to
pick
up
a
nice
little
quarrel
which
i
am
really
in
want
of
but
nothing
happens
either
they
respect
or
they
fear
me
which
is
more
likely
but
they
let
me
trample
down
the
clover
with
my
dogs
insult
and
obstruct
every
one
and
i
come
back
still
more
weary
and
that
s
all
at
any
rate
tell
me
there
s
more
chance
of
fighting
in
paris
is
there
not
in
that
respect
my
dear
friend
it
s
delightful
no
more
edicts
no
more
of
the
cardinal
s
guards
no
more
de
jussacs
nor
other
bloodhounds
i
gad
underneath
a
lamp
in
an
inn
anywhere
they
ask
are
you
one
of
the
fronde
they
unsheathe
and
that
s
all
that
is
said
the
duke
de
guise
killed
monsieur
de
coligny
in
the
place
royale
and
nothing
was
said
of
ah
things
go
on
gaily
then
said
porthos
besides
which
in
a
short
time
resumed
d
artagnan
we
shall
have
set
battles
cannonades
conflagrations
and
there
will
be
great
well
then
i
i
have
your
word
then
yes
tis
given
i
shall
fight
heart
and
soul
for
mazarin
but
but
but
he
must
make
me
a
zounds
said
d
artagnan
that
s
settled
already
i
will
be
responsible
for
the
on
this
promise
being
given
porthos
who
had
never
doubted
his
friend
s
assurance
turned
back
with
him
toward
the
castle
porthos
was
discontented
with
his
condition
as
they
returned
toward
the
castle
d
artagnan
thought
of
the
miseries
of
poor
human
nature
always
dissatisfied
with
what
it
has
ever
desirous
of
what
it
has
not
in
the
position
of
porthos
d
artagnan
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
and
to
make
porthos
contented
there
was
wanting
what
five
letters
to
put
before
his
three
names
a
tiny
coronet
to
paint
upon
the
panels
of
his
carriage
i
shall
pass
all
my
life
thought
d
artagnan
in
seeking
for
a
man
who
is
really
contented
with
his
whilst
making
this
reflection
chance
seemed
as
it
were
to
give
him
the
lie
direct
when
porthos
had
left
him
to
give
some
orders
he
saw
mousqueton
approaching
the
face
of
the
steward
despite
one
slight
shade
of
care
light
as
a
summer
cloud
seemed
a
physiognomy
of
absolute
felicity
here
is
what
i
am
looking
for
thought
d
artagnan
but
alas
the
poor
fellow
does
not
know
the
purpose
for
which
i
am
he
then
made
a
sign
for
mousqueton
to
come
to
him
sir
said
the
servant
i
have
a
favour
to
ask
speak
out
my
i
am
afraid
to
do
so
perhaps
you
will
think
sir
that
prosperity
has
spoiled
me
art
thou
happy
friend
asked
d
artagnan
as
happy
as
possible
and
yet
sir
you
may
make
me
even
happier
than
i
well
speak
if
it
depends
on
oh
sir
it
depends
on
you
i
listen
i
am
waiting
to
sir
the
favor
i
have
to
ask
of
you
is
not
to
call
me
mousqueton
but
since
i
have
had
the
honor
of
being
my
lord
s
steward
i
have
taken
the
last
name
as
more
dignified
and
calculated
to
make
my
inferiors
respect
me
you
sir
know
how
necessary
subordination
is
in
any
large
establishment
of
d
artagnan
smiled
porthos
wanted
to
lengthen
out
his
names
mousqueton
to
cut
his
short
well
my
dear
mouston
he
said
rest
satisfied
i
will
call
thee
mouston
and
if
it
makes
thee
happy
i
will
not
tutoyer
you
any
oh
cried
mousqueton
reddening
with
joy
if
you
do
me
sir
such
honor
i
shall
be
grateful
all
my
life
it
is
too
much
to
alas
thought
d
artagnan
it
is
very
little
to
offset
the
unexpected
tribulations
i
am
bringing
to
this
poor
devil
who
has
so
warmly
welcomed
will
monsieur
remain
long
with
us
asked
mousqueton
with
a
serene
and
glowing
countenance
i
go
my
friend
replied
d
artagnan
ah
monsieur
said
mousqueton
then
you
have
come
here
only
to
awaken
our
i
fear
that
is
true
said
d
artagnan
in
a
low
tone
d
artagnan
was
secretly
touched
with
remorse
not
at
inducing
porthos
to
enter
into
schemes
in
which
his
life
and
fortune
would
be
in
jeopardy
for
porthos
in
the
title
of
baron
had
his
object
and
reward
but
poor
mousqueton
whose
only
wish
was
to
be
called
mouston
was
it
not
cruel
to
snatch
him
from
the
delightful
state
of
peace
and
plenty
in
which
he
was
he
was
thinking
of
these
matters
when
porthos
summoned
him
to
dinner
what
to
dinner
said
d
artagnan
what
time
is
it
then
eh
why
it
is
after
one
o
your
home
is
a
paradise
porthos
one
takes
no
note
of
time
i
follow
you
though
i
am
not
come
if
one
can
t
always
eat
one
can
always
drink
a
maxim
of
poor
athos
the
truth
of
which
i
have
discovered
since
i
began
to
be
d
artagnan
who
as
a
gascon
was
inclined
to
sobriety
seemed
not
so
sure
as
his
friend
of
the
truth
of
athos
s
maxim
but
he
did
his
best
to
keep
up
with
his
host
meanwhile
his
misgivings
in
regard
to
mousqueton
recurred
to
his
mind
and
with
greater
force
because
mousqueton
though
he
did
not
himself
wait
on
the
table
which
would
have
been
beneath
him
in
his
new
position
appeared
at
the
door
from
time
to
time
and
evinced
his
gratitude
to
d
artagnan
by
the
quality
of
the
wine
he
directed
to
be
served
therefore
when
at
dessert
upon
a
sign
from
d
artagnan
porthos
had
sent
away
his
servants
and
the
two
friends
were
alone
porthos
said
d
artagnan
who
will
attend
you
in
your
campaigns
why
replied
porthos
mouston
of
this
was
a
blow
to
d
artagnan
he
could
already
see
the
intendant
s
beaming
smile
change
to
a
contortion
of
grief
but
he
said
mouston
is
not
so
young
as
he
was
my
dear
fellow
besides
he
has
grown
fat
and
perhaps
has
lost
his
fitness
for
active
that
may
be
true
replied
porthos
but
i
am
used
to
him
and
besides
he
wouldn
t
be
willing
to
let
me
go
without
him
he
loves
me
so
oh
blind
thought
d
artagnan
and
you
asked
porthos
haven
t
you
still
in
your
service
your
old
lackey
that
good
that
brave
that
intelligent
then
is
his
name
planchet
yes
i
have
found
him
again
but
he
is
lackey
no
what
is
he
then
with
his
sixteen
hundred
francs
you
remember
the
sixteen
hundred
francs
he
earned
at
the
siege
of
la
rochelle
by
carrying
a
letter
to
lord
de
winter
he
has
set
up
a
little
shop
in
the
rue
des
lombards
and
is
now
a
ah
he
is
a
confectioner
in
the
rue
des
lombards
how
does
it
happen
then
that
he
is
in
your
service
he
has
been
guilty
of
certain
escapades
and
fears
he
may
be
and
the
musketeer
narrated
to
his
friend
planchet
s
adventure
well
said
porthos
if
any
one
had
told
you
in
the
old
times
that
the
day
would
come
when
planchet
would
rescue
rochefort
and
that
you
would
protect
him
in
it
i
should
not
have
believed
him
but
men
are
changed
by
there
is
nothing
truer
than
that
said
porthos
but
what
does
not
change
or
changes
for
the
better
is
wine
taste
of
this
it
is
a
spanish
wine
which
our
friend
athos
thought
much
at
that
moment
the
steward
came
in
to
consult
his
master
upon
the
proceedings
of
the
next
day
and
also
with
regard
to
the
shooting
party
which
had
been
proposed
tell
me
mouston
said
porthos
are
my
arms
in
good
condition
your
arms
my
lord
what
arms
zounds
my
what
weapons
my
military
yes
my
lord
at
any
rate
i
think
make
sure
of
it
and
if
they
want
it
have
them
burnished
up
which
is
my
best
cavalry
horse
and
the
best
hack
what
horse
dost
thou
choose
for
thyself
i
like
rustaud
my
lord
a
good
animal
whose
paces
suit
strong
thinkest
thou
half
norman
half
mecklenburger
will
go
night
and
that
will
do
for
us
see
to
these
horses
polish
up
or
make
some
one
else
polish
my
arms
then
take
pistols
with
thee
and
a
are
we
then
going
to
travel
my
lord
asked
mousqueton
rather
uneasy
something
better
still
an
expedition
sir
asked
the
steward
whose
roses
began
to
change
into
lilies
we
are
going
to
return
to
the
service
mouston
replied
porthos
still
trying
to
restore
his
mustache
to
the
military
curl
it
had
long
lost
into
the
service
the
king
s
service
mousqueton
trembled
even
his
fat
smooth
cheeks
shook
as
he
spoke
and
he
looked
at
d
artagnan
with
an
air
of
reproach
he
staggered
and
his
voice
was
almost
choked
yes
and
no
we
shall
serve
in
a
campaign
seek
out
all
sorts
of
adventures
return
in
short
to
our
former
these
last
words
fell
on
mousqueton
like
a
thunderbolt
it
was
those
very
terrible
old
days
that
made
the
present
so
excessively
delightful
and
the
blow
was
so
great
he
rushed
out
overcome
and
forgot
to
shut
the
door
the
two
friends
remained
alone
to
speak
of
the
future
and
to
build
castles
in
the
air
the
good
wine
which
mousqueton
had
placed
before
them
traced
out
in
glowing
drops
to
d
artagnan
a
fine
perspective
shining
with
quadruples
and
pistoles
and
showed
to
porthos
a
blue
ribbon
and
a
ducal
mantle
they
were
in
fact
asleep
on
the
table
when
the
servants
came
to
light
them
to
their
bed
mousqueton
was
however
somewhat
consoled
by
d
artagnan
who
the
next
day
told
him
that
in
all
probability
war
would
always
be
carried
on
in
the
heart
of
paris
and
within
reach
of
the
chateau
du
vallon
which
was
near
corbeil
or
bracieux
which
was
near
melun
and
of
pierrefonds
which
was
between
compiegne
and
but
formerly
it
appears
began
mousqueton
timidly
oh
said
d
artagnan
we
don
t
now
make
war
as
we
did
formerly
it
s
a
sort
of
diplomatic
arrangement
ask
mousqueton
inquired
therefore
the
state
of
the
case
of
his
old
friend
who
confirmed
the
statement
of
d
artagnan
but
he
added
in
this
war
prisoners
stand
a
chance
of
being
the
deuce
they
do
said
mousqueton
i
think
i
should
like
the
siege
of
rochelle
better
than
this
war
then
porthos
meantime
asked
d
artagnan
to
give
him
his
instructions
how
to
proceed
on
his
journey
four
days
replied
his
friend
are
necessary
to
reach
blois
one
day
to
rest
there
three
or
four
days
to
return
to
paris
set
out
therefore
in
a
week
with
your
suite
and
go
to
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
rue
tiquetonne
and
there
await
that
s
agreed
said
porthos
as
to
myself
i
shall
go
around
to
see
athos
for
though
i
don
t
think
his
aid
worth
much
one
must
with
one
s
friends
observe
all
due
politeness
said
d
artagnan
the
friends
then
took
leave
of
each
other
on
the
very
border
of
the
estate
of
pierrefonds
to
which
porthos
escorted
his
friend
at
least
d
artagnan
said
to
himself
as
he
took
the
road
to
at
least
i
shall
not
be
alone
in
my
undertaking
that
devil
porthos
is
a
man
of
prodigious
strength
still
if
athos
joins
us
well
we
shall
be
three
of
us
to
laugh
at
aramis
that
little
coxcomb
with
his
too
good
at
he
wrote
to
the
cardinal
my
lord
i
have
already
one
man
to
offer
to
your
eminence
and
he
is
well
worth
twenty
men
i
am
just
setting
out
for
blois
the
comte
de
la
fere
inhabits
the
castle
of
bragelonne
in
the
environs
of
that
two
angelic
faces
the
road
was
long
but
the
horses
upon
which
d
artagnan
and
planchet
rode
had
been
refreshed
in
the
well
supplied
stables
of
the
lord
of
bracieux
the
master
and
servant
rode
side
by
side
conversing
as
they
went
for
d
artagnan
had
by
degrees
thrown
off
the
master
and
planchet
had
entirely
ceased
to
assume
the
manners
of
a
servant
he
had
been
raised
by
circumstances
to
the
rank
of
a
confidant
to
his
master
it
was
many
years
since
d
artagnan
had
opened
his
heart
to
any
one
it
happened
however
that
these
two
men
on
meeting
again
assimilated
perfectly
planchet
was
in
truth
no
vulgar
companion
in
these
new
adventures
he
was
a
man
of
uncommonly
sound
sense
without
courting
danger
he
never
shrank
from
an
encounter
in
short
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
arms
ennoble
a
man
it
was
therefore
on
the
footing
of
friends
that
d
artagnan
and
planchet
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
of
blois
going
along
d
artagnan
shaking
his
head
said
i
know
that
my
going
to
athos
is
useless
and
absurd
but
still
i
owe
this
courtesy
to
my
old
friend
a
man
who
had
in
him
material
for
the
most
noble
and
generous
of
oh
monsieur
athos
was
a
noble
gentleman
said
planchet
was
he
not
scattering
money
round
about
him
as
heaven
sprinkles
rain
do
you
remember
sir
that
duel
with
the
englishman
in
the
inclosure
des
carmes
ah
how
lofty
how
magnificent
monsieur
athos
was
that
day
when
he
said
to
his
adversary
you
have
insisted
on
knowing
my
name
sir
so
much
the
worse
for
you
since
i
shall
be
obliged
to
kill
i
was
near
him
those
were
his
exact
words
when
he
stabbed
his
foe
as
he
said
he
would
and
his
adversary
fell
without
saying
oh
tis
a
noble
gentleman
monsieur
yes
true
as
gospel
said
d
artagnan
but
one
single
fault
has
swallowed
up
all
these
fine
i
remember
well
said
planchet
he
was
fond
of
drinking
in
truth
he
drank
but
not
as
other
men
drink
one
seemed
as
he
raised
the
wine
to
his
lips
to
hear
him
say
come
juice
of
the
grape
and
chase
away
my
and
how
he
used
to
break
the
stem
of
a
glass
or
the
neck
of
a
bottle
there
was
no
one
like
him
for
and
now
replied
d
artagnan
behold
the
sad
spectacle
that
awaits
us
this
noble
gentleman
with
his
lofty
glance
this
handsome
cavalier
so
brilliant
in
feats
of
arms
that
every
one
was
surprised
that
he
held
in
his
hand
a
sword
only
instead
of
a
baton
of
command
alas
we
shall
find
him
changed
into
a
broken
down
old
man
with
garnet
nose
and
eyes
that
slobber
we
shall
find
him
extended
on
some
lawn
whence
he
will
look
at
us
with
a
languid
eye
and
peradventure
will
not
recognize
us
god
knows
planchet
that
i
should
fly
from
a
sight
so
sad
if
i
did
not
wish
to
show
my
respect
for
the
illustrious
shadow
of
what
was
once
the
comte
de
la
fere
whom
we
loved
so
planchet
shook
his
head
and
said
nothing
it
was
evident
that
he
shared
his
master
s
apprehensions
and
then
resumed
d
artagnan
to
this
decrepitude
is
probably
added
poverty
for
he
must
have
neglected
the
little
that
he
had
and
the
dirty
scoundrel
grimaud
more
taciturn
than
ever
and
still
more
drunken
than
his
master
stay
planchet
it
breaks
my
heart
to
merely
think
of
i
fancy
myself
there
and
that
i
see
him
staggering
and
hear
him
stammering
said
planchet
in
a
piteous
tone
but
at
all
events
we
shall
soon
know
the
real
state
of
things
for
i
imagine
that
those
lofty
walls
now
turning
ruby
in
the
setting
sun
are
the
walls
of
probably
and
those
steeples
pointed
and
sculptured
that
we
catch
a
glimpse
of
yonder
are
similar
to
those
that
i
have
heard
described
at
at
this
moment
one
of
those
heavy
wagons
drawn
by
bullocks
which
carry
the
wood
cut
in
the
fine
forests
of
the
country
to
the
ports
of
the
loire
came
out
of
a
byroad
full
of
ruts
and
turned
on
that
which
the
two
horsemen
were
following
a
man
carrying
a
long
switch
with
a
nail
at
the
end
of
it
with
which
he
urged
on
his
slow
team
was
walking
with
the
cart
ho
friend
cried
planchet
what
s
your
pleasure
gentlemen
replied
the
peasant
with
a
purity
of
accent
peculiar
to
the
people
of
that
district
and
which
might
have
put
to
shame
the
cultured
denizens
of
the
sorbonne
and
the
rue
de
l
universite
we
are
looking
for
the
house
of
monsieur
de
la
fere
said
d
artagnan
the
peasant
took
off
his
hat
on
hearing
this
revered
name
gentlemen
he
said
the
wood
that
i
am
carting
is
his
i
cut
it
in
his
copse
and
i
am
taking
it
to
the
d
artagnan
determined
not
to
question
this
man
he
did
not
wish
to
hear
from
another
what
he
had
himself
said
to
planchet
the
chateau
he
said
to
himself
what
chateau
ah
i
understand
athos
is
not
a
man
to
be
thwarted
he
like
porthos
has
obliged
his
peasantry
to
call
him
my
lord
and
to
dignify
his
pettifogging
place
by
the
name
of
chateau
he
had
a
heavy
hand
dear
old
athos
after
d
artagnan
after
asking
the
man
the
right
way
continued
his
route
agitated
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
idea
of
seeing
once
more
that
singular
man
whom
he
had
so
truly
loved
and
who
had
contributed
so
much
by
advice
and
example
to
his
education
as
a
gentleman
he
checked
by
degrees
the
speed
of
his
horse
and
went
on
his
head
drooping
as
if
in
deep
thought
soon
as
the
road
turned
the
chateau
de
la
valliere
appeared
in
view
then
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
a
white
house
encircled
in
sycamores
was
visible
at
the
farther
end
of
a
group
of
trees
which
spring
had
powdered
with
a
snow
of
flowers
on
beholding
this
house
d
artagnan
calm
as
he
was
in
general
felt
an
unusual
disturbance
within
his
heart
so
powerful
during
the
whole
course
of
life
are
the
recollections
of
youth
he
proceeded
nevertheless
and
came
opposite
to
an
iron
gate
ornamented
in
the
taste
of
the
period
through
the
gate
was
seen
carefully
attended
to
a
spacious
courtyard
in
which
neighed
several
horses
held
by
valets
in
various
liveries
and
a
carriage
drawn
by
two
horses
of
the
country
we
are
mistaken
said
d
artagnan
this
can
not
be
the
establishment
of
athos
good
heavens
suppose
he
is
dead
and
that
this
property
now
belongs
to
some
one
who
bears
his
name
alight
planchet
and
inquire
for
i
confess
that
i
have
scarcely
courage
so
to
planchet
alighted
thou
must
add
said
d
artagnan
that
a
gentleman
who
is
passing
by
wishes
to
have
the
honor
of
paying
his
respects
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
if
thou
art
satisfied
with
what
thou
hearest
then
mention
my
name
planchet
leading
his
horse
by
the
bridle
drew
near
to
the
gate
and
rang
the
bell
and
immediately
a
with
white
hair
and
of
erect
stature
notwithstanding
his
age
presented
himself
does
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
live
here
asked
planchet
yes
monsieur
it
is
here
he
lives
the
servant
replied
to
planchet
who
was
not
in
livery
a
nobleman
retired
from
service
is
he
not
and
who
had
a
lackey
named
grimaud
persisted
planchet
who
had
prudently
considered
that
he
couldn
t
have
too
much
information
monsieur
grimaud
is
absent
from
the
chateau
for
the
time
being
said
the
servitor
who
little
used
as
he
was
to
such
inquiries
began
to
examine
planchet
from
head
to
foot
then
cried
planchet
joyously
i
see
well
that
it
is
the
same
comte
de
la
fere
whom
we
seek
be
good
enough
to
open
to
me
for
i
wish
to
announce
to
monsieur
le
comte
that
my
master
one
of
his
friends
is
here
and
wishes
to
greet
why
didn
t
you
say
so
said
the
servitor
opening
the
gate
but
where
is
your
master
he
is
following
the
servitor
opened
the
gate
and
walked
before
planchet
who
made
a
sign
to
d
artagnan
the
latter
his
heart
palpitating
more
than
ever
entered
the
courtyard
without
dismounting
whilst
planchet
was
standing
on
the
steps
before
the
house
he
heard
a
voice
say
well
where
is
this
gentleman
and
why
do
they
not
bring
him
here
this
voice
the
sound
of
which
reached
d
artagnan
reawakened
in
his
heart
a
thousand
sentiments
a
thousand
recollections
that
he
had
forgotten
he
vaulted
hastily
from
his
horse
whilst
planchet
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
advanced
toward
the
master
of
the
house
but
i
know
you
my
lad
said
athos
appearing
on
the
threshold
oh
yes
monsieur
le
comte
you
know
me
and
i
know
you
i
am
planchet
planchet
whom
you
know
but
the
honest
servant
could
say
no
more
so
much
was
he
overcome
by
this
unexpected
interview
what
planchet
is
monsieur
d
artagnan
here
here
i
am
my
friend
dear
athos
cried
d
artagnan
in
a
faltering
voice
and
almost
staggering
from
agitation
at
these
words
a
visible
emotion
was
expressed
on
the
beautiful
countenance
and
calm
features
of
athos
he
rushed
toward
d
artagnan
with
eyes
fixed
upon
him
and
clasped
him
in
his
arms
d
artagnan
equally
moved
pressed
him
also
closely
to
him
whilst
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
athos
then
took
him
by
the
hand
and
led
him
into
the
where
there
were
several
people
every
one
arose
i
present
to
you
he
said
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
lieutenant
of
his
majesty
s
musketeers
a
devoted
friend
and
one
of
the
most
excellent
brave
gentlemen
that
i
have
ever
d
artagnan
received
the
compliments
of
those
who
were
present
in
his
own
way
and
whilst
the
conversation
became
general
he
looked
earnestly
at
athos
strange
athos
was
scarcely
aged
at
all
his
fine
eyes
no
longer
surrounded
by
that
dark
line
which
nights
of
dissipation
pencil
too
infallibly
seemed
larger
more
liquid
than
ever
his
face
a
little
elongated
had
gained
in
calm
dignity
what
it
had
lost
in
feverish
excitement
his
hand
always
wonderfully
beautiful
and
strong
was
set
off
by
a
ruffle
of
lace
like
certain
hands
by
titian
and
vandyck
he
was
less
stiff
than
formerly
his
long
dark
hair
softly
powdered
here
and
there
with
silver
tendrils
fell
elegantly
over
his
shoulders
in
wavy
curls
his
voice
was
still
youthful
as
if
belonging
to
a
hercules
of
and
his
magnificent
teeth
which
he
had
preserved
white
and
sound
gave
an
indescribable
charm
to
his
smile
meanwhile
the
guests
seeing
that
the
two
friends
were
longing
to
be
alone
prepared
to
depart
when
a
noise
of
dogs
barking
resounded
through
the
courtyard
and
many
persons
said
at
the
same
moment
ah
tis
raoul
who
is
come
athos
as
the
name
of
raoul
was
pronounced
looked
inquisitively
at
d
artagnan
in
order
to
see
if
any
curiosity
was
painted
on
his
face
but
d
artagnan
was
still
in
confusion
and
turned
around
almost
mechanically
when
a
fine
young
man
of
fifteen
years
of
age
dressed
simply
but
in
perfect
taste
entered
the
room
raising
as
he
came
his
hat
adorned
with
a
long
plume
of
scarlet
feathers
nevertheless
d
artagnan
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
this
new
personage
it
seemed
to
explain
to
him
the
change
in
athos
a
resemblance
between
the
boy
and
the
man
explained
the
mystery
of
this
regenerated
existence
he
remained
listening
and
gazing
here
you
are
home
again
raoul
said
the
comte
yes
sir
replied
the
youth
with
deep
respect
and
i
have
performed
the
commission
that
you
gave
but
what
s
the
matter
raoul
said
athos
very
anxiously
you
are
pale
and
sir
replied
the
young
man
it
is
on
account
of
an
accident
which
has
happened
to
our
little
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
asked
athos
quickly
what
is
it
cried
many
persons
present
she
was
walking
with
her
nurse
marceline
in
the
place
where
the
woodmen
cut
the
wood
when
passing
on
horseback
i
stopped
she
saw
me
also
and
in
trying
to
jump
from
the
end
of
a
pile
of
wood
on
which
she
had
mounted
the
poor
child
fell
and
was
not
able
to
rise
again
i
fear
that
she
has
badly
sprained
her
oh
heavens
cried
athos
and
her
mother
madame
de
have
they
yet
told
her
of
it
no
sir
madame
de
is
at
blois
with
the
duchess
of
orleans
i
am
afraid
that
what
was
first
done
was
unskillful
if
not
worse
than
useless
i
am
come
sir
to
ask
your
send
directly
to
blois
raoul
or
rather
take
horse
and
ride
immediately
raoul
bowed
but
where
is
louise
asked
the
comte
i
have
brought
her
here
sir
and
i
have
deposited
her
in
charge
of
charlotte
who
till
better
advice
comes
has
bathed
the
foot
in
cold
the
guests
now
all
took
leave
of
athos
excepting
the
old
duc
de
barbe
who
as
an
old
friend
of
the
family
of
la
valliere
went
to
see
little
louise
and
offered
to
take
her
to
blois
in
his
carriage
you
are
right
sir
said
athos
she
will
be
the
sooner
with
her
mother
as
for
you
raoul
i
am
sure
it
is
your
fault
some
giddiness
or
no
sir
i
assure
you
muttered
raoul
it
is
oh
no
no
i
declare
it
is
not
cried
the
young
girl
while
raoul
turned
pale
at
the
idea
of
his
being
perhaps
the
cause
of
her
disaster
nevertheless
raoul
you
must
go
to
blois
and
you
must
make
your
excuses
and
mine
to
madame
de
the
youth
looked
pleased
he
again
took
in
his
strong
arms
the
little
girl
whose
pretty
golden
head
and
smiling
face
rested
on
his
shoulder
and
placed
her
gently
in
the
carriage
then
jumping
on
his
horse
with
the
elegance
of
a
esquire
after
bowing
to
athos
and
d
artagnan
he
went
off
close
by
the
door
of
the
carriage
on
somebody
inside
of
which
his
eyes
were
riveted
the
castle
of
bragelonne
whilst
this
scene
was
going
on
d
artagnan
remained
with
open
mouth
and
a
confused
gaze
everything
had
turned
out
so
differently
from
what
he
expected
that
he
was
stupefied
with
wonder
athos
who
had
been
observing
him
and
guessing
his
thoughts
took
his
arm
and
led
him
into
the
garden
whilst
supper
is
being
prepared
he
said
smiling
you
will
not
my
friend
be
sorry
to
have
the
mystery
which
so
puzzles
you
cleared
true
monsieur
le
comte
replied
d
artagnan
who
felt
that
by
degrees
athos
was
resuming
that
great
influence
which
aristocracy
had
over
him
athos
smiled
first
and
foremost
dear
d
artagnan
we
have
no
title
such
as
count
here
when
i
call
you
chevalier
it
is
in
presenting
you
to
my
guests
that
they
may
know
who
you
are
but
to
you
d
artagnan
i
am
i
hope
still
dear
athos
your
comrade
your
friend
do
you
intend
to
stand
on
ceremony
because
you
are
less
attached
to
me
than
you
were
oh
god
forbid
then
let
us
be
as
we
used
to
be
let
us
be
open
with
each
other
you
are
surprised
at
what
you
see
here
but
above
all
things
i
am
a
marvel
to
you
i
confess
i
am
still
young
am
i
not
should
you
not
have
known
me
again
in
spite
of
my
years
of
age
on
the
contrary
i
do
not
find
you
the
same
person
at
i
understand
cried
athos
with
a
gentle
blush
everything
d
artagnan
even
folly
has
its
then
your
means
it
appears
are
improved
you
have
a
capital
house
your
own
i
presume
you
have
a
park
and
horses
athos
smiled
yes
i
inherited
this
little
property
when
i
quitted
the
army
as
i
told
you
the
park
is
twenty
acres
twenty
comprising
and
a
common
i
have
two
horses
i
do
not
count
my
servant
s
bobtailed
nag
my
sporting
dogs
consist
of
two
pointers
two
harriers
and
two
setters
but
then
all
this
extravagance
is
not
for
myself
added
athos
laughing
yes
i
see
for
the
young
man
raoul
said
d
artagnan
you
guess
aright
my
friend
this
youth
is
an
orphan
deserted
by
his
mother
who
left
him
in
the
house
of
a
poor
country
priest
i
have
brought
him
up
it
is
raoul
who
has
worked
in
me
the
change
you
see
i
was
dried
up
like
a
miserable
tree
isolated
attached
to
nothing
on
earth
it
was
only
a
deep
affection
that
could
make
me
take
root
again
and
drag
me
back
to
life
this
child
has
caused
me
to
recover
what
i
had
lost
i
had
no
longer
any
wish
to
live
for
myself
i
have
lived
for
him
i
have
corrected
the
vices
that
i
had
i
have
assumed
the
virtues
that
i
had
not
precept
something
but
example
more
i
may
be
mistaken
but
i
believe
that
raoul
will
be
as
accomplished
a
gentleman
as
our
degenerate
age
could
the
remembrance
of
milady
recurred
to
d
artagnan
and
you
are
happy
he
said
to
his
friend
as
happy
as
it
is
allowed
to
one
of
god
s
creatures
to
be
on
this
earth
but
say
out
all
you
think
d
artagnan
for
you
have
not
yet
done
you
are
too
bad
athos
one
can
hide
nothing
from
you
answered
d
artagnan
i
wished
to
ask
you
if
you
ever
feel
any
emotions
of
terror
resembling
remorse
i
finish
your
phrase
yes
and
no
i
do
not
feel
remorse
because
that
woman
i
profoundly
hold
deserved
her
punishment
had
she
one
redeeming
trait
i
doubt
it
i
do
not
feel
remorse
because
had
we
allowed
her
to
live
she
would
have
persisted
in
her
work
of
destruction
but
i
do
not
mean
my
friend
that
we
were
right
in
what
we
did
perhaps
all
blood
demands
some
expiation
hers
had
been
accomplished
it
remains
possibly
for
us
to
accomplish
i
have
sometimes
thought
as
you
do
she
had
a
son
that
unhappy
woman
have
you
ever
heard
of
him
he
must
be
about
years
of
age
said
athos
in
a
low
tone
i
often
think
of
that
young
man
d
strange
for
i
had
forgotten
him
said
the
lieutenant
athos
smiled
the
smile
was
melancholy
and
lord
de
winter
do
you
know
anything
about
him
i
know
that
he
is
in
high
favor
with
charles
the
fortunes
of
that
monarch
now
are
at
low
water
he
shed
the
blood
of
strafford
that
confirms
what
i
said
just
now
blood
will
have
blood
and
the
queen
what
queen
madame
henrietta
of
england
daughter
of
henry
she
is
at
the
louvre
as
you
yes
and
i
hear
in
bitter
poverty
her
daughter
during
the
severest
cold
was
obliged
for
want
of
fire
to
remain
in
bed
do
you
grasp
that
said
athos
shrugging
his
shoulders
the
daughter
of
henry
iv
shivering
for
want
of
a
fagot
why
did
she
not
ask
from
any
one
of
us
a
home
instead
of
from
mazarin
she
should
have
wanted
have
you
ever
seen
the
queen
of
england
inquired
d
artagnan
no
but
my
mother
as
a
child
saw
her
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
my
mother
was
lady
of
honor
to
marie
de
medici
never
you
know
athos
you
never
spoke
much
of
such
ah
mon
dieu
yes
you
are
right
athos
replied
but
then
there
must
be
some
occasion
for
porthos
wouldn
t
have
waited
for
it
so
patiently
said
d
artagnan
with
a
smile
every
one
according
to
his
nature
my
dear
d
artagnan
porthos
in
spite
of
a
touch
of
vanity
has
many
excellent
qualities
have
you
seen
him
i
left
him
five
days
ago
said
d
artagnan
and
he
portrayed
with
gascon
wit
and
sprightliness
the
magnificence
of
porthos
in
his
chateau
of
pierrefonds
nor
did
he
neglect
to
launch
a
few
arrows
of
wit
at
the
excellent
monsieur
mouston
i
sometimes
wonder
replied
athos
smiling
at
that
gayety
which
recalled
the
good
old
days
that
we
could
form
an
association
of
men
who
would
be
after
twenty
years
of
separation
still
so
closely
bound
together
friendship
throws
out
deep
roots
in
honest
hearts
d
artagnan
believe
me
it
is
only
the
who
deny
friendship
they
can
not
understand
it
and
aramis
i
have
seen
him
also
said
d
artagnan
but
he
seemed
to
me
ah
you
have
seen
aramis
said
athos
turning
on
d
artagnan
a
searching
look
why
it
is
a
veritable
pilgrimage
my
dear
friend
that
you
are
making
to
the
temple
of
friendship
as
the
poets
would
why
yes
replied
d
artagnan
with
embarrassment
aramis
you
know
continued
athos
is
naturally
cold
and
then
he
is
always
involved
in
intrigues
with
i
believe
he
is
at
this
moment
in
a
very
complicated
one
said
d
artagnan
athos
made
no
reply
he
is
not
curious
thought
d
artagnan
athos
not
only
failed
to
reply
he
even
changed
the
subject
of
conversation
you
see
said
he
calling
d
artagnan
s
attention
to
the
fact
that
they
had
come
back
to
the
chateau
after
an
hour
s
walk
we
have
made
a
tour
of
my
all
is
charming
and
everything
savors
of
nobility
replied
d
artagnan
at
this
instant
they
heard
the
sound
of
horses
feet
tis
raoul
who
has
come
back
said
athos
and
we
can
now
hear
how
the
poor
child
in
fact
the
young
man
appeared
at
the
gate
covered
with
dust
entered
the
courtyard
leaped
from
his
horse
which
he
consigned
to
the
charge
of
a
groom
and
then
went
to
greet
the
count
and
d
artagnan
monsieur
said
athos
placing
his
hand
on
d
artagnan
s
shoulder
monsieur
is
the
chevalier
d
artagnan
of
whom
you
have
often
heard
me
speak
monsieur
said
the
young
man
saluting
again
and
more
profoundly
monsieur
le
comte
has
pronounced
your
name
before
me
as
an
example
whenever
he
wished
to
speak
of
an
intrepid
and
generous
that
little
compliment
could
not
fail
to
move
d
artagnan
he
extended
a
hand
to
raoul
and
said
my
young
friend
all
the
praises
that
are
given
me
should
be
passed
on
to
the
count
here
for
he
has
educated
me
in
everything
and
it
is
not
his
fault
that
his
pupil
profited
so
little
from
his
instructions
but
he
will
make
it
up
in
you
i
am
sure
i
like
your
manner
raoul
and
your
politeness
has
touched
athos
was
more
delighted
than
can
be
told
he
looked
at
d
artagnan
with
an
expression
of
gratitude
and
then
bestowed
on
raoul
one
of
those
strange
smiles
of
which
children
are
so
proud
when
they
receive
them
now
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
noticing
that
silent
play
of
countenance
i
am
sure
of
i
hope
the
accident
has
been
of
no
consequence
they
don
t
yet
know
sir
on
account
of
the
swelling
but
the
doctor
is
afraid
some
tendon
has
been
at
this
moment
a
little
boy
half
peasant
half
came
to
announce
supper
athos
led
his
guest
into
a
of
moderate
size
the
windows
of
which
opened
on
one
side
on
a
garden
on
the
other
on
a
full
of
magnificent
flowers
d
artagnan
glanced
at
the
dinner
service
the
plate
was
magnificent
old
and
appertaining
to
the
family
d
artagnan
stopped
to
look
at
a
sideboard
on
which
was
a
superb
ewer
of
silver
that
workmanship
is
divine
he
exclaimed
yes
a
chef
d
oeuvre
of
the
great
florentine
sculptor
benvenuto
cellini
replied
athos
what
battle
does
it
represent
that
of
marignan
just
at
the
point
where
one
of
my
forefathers
is
offering
his
sword
to
francis
who
has
broken
his
it
was
on
that
occasion
that
my
ancestor
enguerrand
de
la
fere
was
made
a
knight
of
the
order
of
michael
besides
which
the
king
fifteen
years
afterward
gave
him
also
this
ewer
and
a
sword
which
you
may
have
seen
formerly
in
my
house
also
a
lovely
specimen
of
workmanship
men
were
giants
in
those
times
said
athos
now
we
are
pigmies
in
comparison
let
us
sit
down
to
supper
call
charles
he
added
addressing
the
boy
who
waited
my
good
charles
i
particularly
recommend
to
your
care
planchet
the
laquais
of
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
likes
good
wine
now
you
have
the
key
of
the
cellar
he
has
slept
a
long
time
on
a
hard
bed
so
he
won
t
object
to
a
soft
one
take
every
care
of
him
i
beg
of
charles
bowed
and
retired
you
think
of
everything
said
d
artagnan
and
i
thank
you
for
planchet
my
dear
raoul
stared
on
hearing
this
name
and
looked
at
the
count
to
be
quite
sure
that
it
was
he
whom
the
lieutenant
thus
addressed
that
name
sounds
strange
to
you
said
athos
smiling
it
was
my
nom
de
guerre
when
monsieur
d
artagnan
two
other
gallant
friends
and
myself
performed
some
feats
of
arms
at
the
siege
of
la
rochelle
under
the
deceased
cardinal
and
monsieur
de
bassompierre
my
friend
is
still
so
kind
as
to
address
me
by
that
old
and
well
beloved
appellation
which
makes
my
heart
glad
when
i
hear
tis
an
illustrious
name
said
the
lieutenant
and
had
one
day
triumphal
honors
paid
to
what
do
you
mean
sir
inquired
raoul
you
have
not
forgotten
gervais
athos
and
the
napkin
which
was
converted
into
a
banner
and
he
then
related
to
raoul
the
story
of
the
bastion
and
raoul
fancied
he
was
listening
to
one
of
those
deeds
of
arms
belonging
to
days
of
chivalry
so
gloriously
recounted
by
tasso
and
ariosto
d
artagnan
does
not
tell
you
raoul
said
athos
in
his
turn
that
he
was
reckoned
one
of
the
finest
swordsmen
of
his
time
a
knuckle
of
iron
a
wrist
of
steel
a
sure
eye
and
a
glance
of
fire
that
s
what
his
adversary
met
with
he
was
eighteen
only
three
years
older
than
you
are
raoul
when
i
saw
him
set
to
work
pitted
against
tried
and
did
monsieur
d
artagnan
come
off
the
conqueror
asked
the
young
man
with
glistening
eye
i
killed
one
man
if
i
recollect
rightly
replied
d
artagnan
with
a
look
of
inquiry
directed
to
athos
another
i
disarmed
or
wounded
i
don
t
remember
wounded
said
athos
it
was
a
phenomenon
of
the
young
man
would
willingly
have
prolonged
this
conversation
far
into
the
night
but
athos
pointed
out
to
him
that
his
guest
must
need
repose
d
artagnan
would
fain
have
declared
that
he
was
not
fatigued
but
athos
insisted
on
his
retiring
to
his
chamber
conducted
thither
by
raoul
athos
as
a
diplomatist
d
artagnan
retired
to
bed
not
to
sleep
but
to
think
over
all
he
had
heard
that
evening
being
naturally
goodhearted
and
having
had
once
a
liking
for
athos
which
had
grown
into
a
sincere
friendship
he
was
delighted
at
thus
meeting
a
man
full
of
intelligence
and
moral
strength
instead
of
a
drunkard
he
admitted
without
annoyance
the
continued
superiority
of
athos
over
himself
devoid
as
he
was
of
that
jealousy
which
might
have
saddened
a
less
generous
disposition
he
was
delighted
also
that
the
high
qualities
of
athos
appeared
to
promise
favorably
for
his
mission
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
him
that
athos
was
not
in
all
respects
sincere
and
frank
who
was
the
youth
he
had
adopted
and
who
bore
so
striking
a
resemblance
to
him
what
could
explain
athos
s
having
the
world
and
the
extreme
sobriety
he
had
observed
at
table
the
absence
of
grimaud
whose
name
had
never
once
been
uttered
by
athos
gave
d
artagnan
uneasiness
it
was
evident
either
that
he
no
longer
possessed
the
confidence
of
his
friend
or
that
athos
was
bound
by
some
invisible
chain
or
that
he
had
been
forewarned
of
the
lieutenant
s
visit
he
could
not
help
thinking
of
rochefort
whom
he
had
seen
in
notre
dame
could
de
rochefort
have
forestalled
him
with
athos
again
the
moderate
fortune
which
athos
possessed
concealed
as
it
was
so
skillfully
seemed
to
show
a
regard
for
appearances
and
to
betray
a
latent
ambition
which
might
be
easily
aroused
the
clear
and
vigorous
intellect
of
athos
would
render
him
more
open
to
conviction
than
a
less
able
man
would
be
he
would
enter
into
the
minister
s
schemes
with
the
more
ardor
because
his
natural
activity
would
be
doubled
by
necessity
resolved
to
seek
an
explanation
on
all
these
points
on
the
following
day
d
artagnan
in
spite
of
his
fatigue
prepared
for
an
attack
and
determined
that
it
should
take
place
after
breakfast
he
determined
to
cultivate
the
of
the
youth
raoul
and
either
whilst
fencing
with
him
or
when
out
shooting
to
extract
from
his
simplicity
some
information
which
would
connect
the
athos
of
old
times
with
the
athos
of
the
present
but
d
artagnan
at
the
same
time
being
a
man
of
extreme
caution
was
quite
aware
what
injury
he
should
do
himself
if
by
any
indiscretion
or
awkwardness
he
should
betray
has
manoeuvering
to
the
experienced
eye
of
athos
besides
to
tell
truth
whilst
d
artagnan
was
quite
disposed
to
adopt
a
subtle
course
against
the
cunning
of
aramis
or
the
vanity
of
porthos
he
was
ashamed
to
equivocate
with
athos
open
athos
it
seemed
to
him
that
if
porthos
and
aramis
deemed
him
superior
to
them
in
the
arts
of
diplomacy
they
would
like
him
all
the
better
for
it
but
that
athos
on
the
contrary
would
despise
him
ah
why
is
not
grimaud
the
taciturn
grimaud
here
thought
d
artagnan
there
are
so
many
things
his
silence
would
have
told
me
with
grimaud
silence
was
another
form
of
eloquence
there
reigned
a
perfect
stillness
in
the
house
d
artagnan
had
heard
the
door
shut
and
the
shutters
barred
the
dogs
became
in
their
turn
silent
at
last
a
nightingale
lost
in
a
thicket
of
shrubs
in
the
midst
of
its
most
melodious
cadences
had
fluted
low
and
lower
into
stillness
and
fallen
asleep
not
a
sound
was
heard
in
the
castle
except
of
a
footstep
up
and
down
in
the
chamber
above
as
he
supposed
the
bedroom
of
athos
he
is
walking
about
and
thinking
thought
d
artagnan
but
of
what
it
is
impossible
to
know
everything
else
might
be
guessed
but
not
at
length
athos
went
to
bed
apparently
for
the
noise
ceased
silence
and
fatigue
together
overcame
d
artagnan
and
sleep
overtook
him
also
he
was
not
however
a
good
sleeper
scarcely
had
dawn
gilded
his
window
curtains
when
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
opened
the
windows
somebody
he
perceived
was
in
the
courtyard
moving
stealthily
true
to
his
custom
of
never
passing
anything
over
that
it
was
within
his
power
to
know
d
artagnan
looked
out
of
the
window
and
perceived
the
close
red
coat
and
brown
hair
of
raoul
the
young
man
was
opening
the
door
of
the
stable
he
then
with
noiseless
haste
took
out
the
horse
that
he
had
ridden
on
the
previous
evening
saddled
and
bridled
it
himself
and
led
the
animal
into
the
alley
to
the
right
of
the
opened
a
side
door
which
conducted
him
to
a
bridle
road
shut
it
after
him
and
d
artagnan
saw
him
pass
by
like
a
dart
bending
as
he
went
beneath
the
pendent
flowery
branches
of
maple
and
acacia
the
road
as
d
artagnan
had
observed
was
the
way
to
blois
so
thought
the
gascon
here
s
a
young
blade
who
has
already
his
love
affair
who
doesn
t
at
all
agree
with
athos
in
his
hatred
to
the
fair
sex
he
s
not
going
to
hunt
for
he
has
neither
dogs
nor
arms
he
s
not
going
on
a
message
for
he
goes
secretly
why
does
he
go
in
secret
is
he
afraid
of
me
or
of
his
father
for
i
am
sure
the
count
is
his
father
by
jove
i
shall
know
about
that
soon
for
i
shall
soon
speak
out
to
day
was
now
advanced
all
the
noises
that
had
ceased
the
night
before
reawakened
one
after
the
other
the
bird
on
the
branch
the
dog
in
his
kennel
the
sheep
in
the
field
the
boats
moored
in
the
loire
even
became
alive
and
vocal
the
latter
leaving
the
shore
abandoned
themselves
gaily
to
the
current
the
gascon
gave
a
last
twirl
to
his
mustache
a
last
turn
to
his
hair
brushed
from
habit
the
brim
of
his
hat
with
the
sleeve
of
his
doublet
and
went
downstairs
scarcely
had
he
descended
the
last
step
of
the
threshold
when
he
saw
athos
bent
down
toward
the
ground
as
if
he
were
looking
for
a
in
the
dust
my
dear
host
cried
d
artagnan
to
you
have
you
slept
well
excellently
athos
but
what
are
you
looking
for
you
are
perhaps
a
tulip
fancier
my
dear
friend
if
i
am
you
must
not
laugh
at
me
for
being
so
in
the
country
people
alter
one
gets
to
like
without
knowing
it
all
those
beautiful
objects
that
god
causes
to
spring
from
the
earth
which
are
despised
in
cities
i
was
looking
anxiously
for
some
iris
roots
i
planted
here
close
to
this
reservoir
and
which
some
one
has
trampled
upon
this
morning
these
gardeners
are
the
most
careless
people
in
the
world
in
bringing
the
horse
out
to
the
water
they
ve
allowed
him
to
walk
over
the
d
artagnan
began
to
smile
ah
you
think
so
do
you
and
he
took
his
friend
along
the
alley
where
a
number
of
tracks
like
those
which
had
trampled
down
the
flowerbeds
were
visible
here
are
the
horse
s
hoofs
again
it
seems
athos
he
said
carelessly
yes
indeed
the
marks
are
quite
so
replied
the
lieutenant
who
went
out
this
morning
athos
asked
uneasily
has
any
horse
got
loose
not
likely
answered
the
gascon
these
marks
are
where
is
raoul
asked
athos
how
is
it
that
i
have
not
seen
him
hush
exclaimed
d
artagnan
putting
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
he
related
what
he
had
seen
watching
athos
all
the
while
ah
he
s
gone
to
blois
the
poor
boy
wherefore
ah
to
inquire
after
the
little
la
valliere
she
has
sprained
her
foot
you
you
think
he
has
i
am
sure
of
it
said
athos
don
t
you
see
that
raoul
is
in
love
indeed
with
whom
with
a
child
seven
years
old
dear
friend
at
raoul
s
age
the
heart
is
so
expansive
that
it
must
encircle
one
object
or
another
fancied
or
real
well
his
love
is
half
real
half
fanciful
she
is
the
prettiest
little
creature
in
the
world
with
flaxen
hair
blue
eyes
at
once
saucy
and
but
what
say
you
to
raoul
s
fancy
nothing
i
laugh
at
raoul
but
this
first
desire
of
the
heart
is
imperious
i
remember
just
at
his
age
how
deep
in
love
i
was
with
a
grecian
statue
which
our
good
king
then
henry
gave
my
father
insomuch
that
i
was
mad
with
grief
when
they
told
me
that
the
story
of
pygmalion
was
nothing
but
a
it
is
mere
want
of
occupation
you
do
not
make
raoul
work
so
he
takes
his
own
way
of
employing
exactly
therefore
i
think
of
sending
him
away
from
you
will
be
wise
to
do
no
doubt
of
it
but
it
will
break
his
heart
so
long
as
three
or
four
years
ago
he
used
to
adorn
and
adore
his
little
idol
whom
he
will
some
day
fall
in
love
with
in
right
earnest
if
he
remains
here
the
parents
of
little
la
valliere
have
for
a
long
time
perceived
and
been
amused
at
it
now
they
begin
to
look
nonsense
however
raoul
must
be
diverted
from
this
fancy
send
him
away
or
you
will
never
make
a
man
of
i
think
i
shall
send
him
to
so
thought
d
artagnan
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
moment
for
attack
had
arrived
suppose
he
said
we
roughly
chalk
out
a
career
for
this
young
man
i
wish
to
consult
you
about
some
do
do
you
think
it
is
time
for
us
to
enter
the
service
but
are
you
not
still
in
the
service
you
d
artagnan
i
mean
active
service
our
former
life
has
it
still
no
attractions
for
you
would
you
not
be
happy
to
begin
anew
in
my
society
and
in
that
of
porthos
the
exploits
of
our
youth
do
you
propose
to
me
to
do
so
d
artagnan
decidedly
and
on
whose
side
asked
athos
fixing
his
clear
benevolent
glance
on
the
countenance
of
the
gascon
ah
devil
take
it
you
speak
in
earnest
and
must
have
a
definite
answer
listen
d
artagnan
there
is
but
one
person
or
rather
one
cause
to
whom
a
man
like
me
can
be
useful
that
of
the
exactly
answered
the
musketeer
yes
but
let
us
understand
each
other
returned
athos
seriously
if
by
the
cause
of
the
king
you
mean
that
of
monsieur
de
mazarin
we
do
not
understand
each
i
don
t
say
exactly
answered
the
gascon
confused
come
d
artagnan
don
t
let
us
play
a
sidelong
game
your
hesitation
your
evasion
tells
me
at
once
on
whose
side
you
are
for
that
party
no
one
dares
openly
to
recruit
and
when
people
recruit
for
it
it
is
with
averted
eyes
and
humble
ah
my
dear
athos
you
know
that
i
am
not
alluding
to
you
you
are
the
pearl
of
brave
bold
men
i
speak
of
that
spiteful
and
intriguing
italian
of
the
pedant
who
has
tried
to
put
on
his
own
head
a
crown
which
he
stole
from
under
a
pillow
of
the
scoundrel
who
calls
his
party
the
party
of
the
king
who
wants
to
send
the
princes
of
the
blood
to
prison
not
daring
to
kill
them
as
our
great
cardinal
our
cardinal
did
of
the
miser
who
weighs
his
gold
pieces
and
keeps
the
clipped
ones
for
fear
though
he
is
rich
of
losing
them
at
play
next
morning
of
the
impudent
fellow
who
insults
the
queen
as
they
say
so
much
the
worse
for
her
and
who
is
going
in
three
months
to
make
war
upon
us
in
order
that
he
may
retain
his
pensions
is
that
the
master
whom
you
propose
to
me
i
thank
you
d
you
are
more
impetuous
than
you
were
returned
d
artagnan
age
has
warmed
not
chilled
your
blood
who
informed
you
this
was
the
master
i
propose
to
you
devil
take
it
he
muttered
to
himself
don
t
let
me
betray
my
secrets
to
a
man
not
inclined
to
entertain
well
then
said
athos
what
are
your
schemes
what
do
you
propose
zounds
nothing
more
than
natural
you
live
on
your
estate
happy
in
golden
mediocrity
porthos
has
perhaps
sixty
thousand
francs
income
aramis
has
always
fifty
duchesses
quarreling
over
the
priest
as
they
quarreled
formerly
over
the
musketeer
but
i
what
have
i
in
the
world
i
have
worn
my
cuirass
these
twenty
years
kept
down
in
this
inferior
rank
without
going
forward
or
backward
hardly
half
living
in
fact
i
am
dead
well
when
there
is
some
idea
of
being
resuscitated
you
say
he
s
a
scoundrel
an
impudent
fellow
a
miser
a
bad
master
by
jove
i
am
of
your
opinion
but
find
me
a
better
one
or
give
me
the
means
of
athos
was
for
a
few
moments
thoughtful
good
d
artagnan
is
for
mazarin
he
said
to
himself
from
that
moment
he
grew
very
guarded
on
his
side
d
artagnan
became
more
cautious
also
you
spoke
to
me
athos
resumed
of
porthos
have
you
persuaded
him
to
seek
his
fortune
but
he
has
wealth
i
believe
doubtless
he
has
but
such
is
man
we
always
want
something
more
than
we
already
what
does
porthos
wish
for
to
be
a
ah
true
i
forgot
said
athos
laughing
tis
true
thought
the
gascon
where
has
he
heard
it
does
he
correspond
with
aramis
ah
if
i
knew
that
he
did
i
should
know
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
raoul
is
our
little
neighbor
worse
asked
d
artagnan
seeing
a
look
of
vexation
on
the
face
of
the
youth
ah
sir
replied
raoul
her
fall
is
a
very
serious
one
and
without
any
ostensible
injury
the
physician
fears
she
will
be
lame
for
this
is
terrible
said
athos
and
what
makes
me
all
the
more
wretched
sir
is
that
i
was
the
cause
of
this
how
so
asked
athos
it
was
to
run
to
meet
me
that
she
leaped
from
that
pile
of
there
s
only
one
remedy
dear
raoul
that
is
to
marry
her
as
a
remarked
d
artagnan
ah
sir
answered
raoul
you
joke
about
a
real
misfortune
that
is
cruel
the
good
understanding
between
the
two
friends
was
not
in
the
least
altered
by
the
morning
s
skirmish
they
breakfasted
with
a
good
appetite
looking
now
and
then
at
poor
raoul
who
with
moist
eyes
and
a
full
heart
scarcely
ate
at
all
after
breakfast
two
letters
arrived
for
athos
who
read
them
with
profound
attention
whilst
d
artagnan
could
not
restrain
himself
from
jumping
up
several
times
on
seeing
him
read
these
epistles
in
one
of
which
there
being
at
the
time
a
very
strong
light
he
perceived
the
fine
writing
of
aramis
the
other
was
in
a
feminine
hand
long
and
crossed
come
said
d
artagnan
to
raoul
seeing
that
athos
wished
to
be
alone
come
let
us
take
a
turn
in
the
fencing
gallery
that
will
amuse
and
they
both
went
into
a
low
room
where
there
were
foils
gloves
masks
breastplates
and
all
the
accessories
for
a
fencing
match
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
athos
joined
them
and
at
the
same
moment
charles
brought
in
a
letter
for
d
artagnan
which
a
messenger
had
just
desired
might
be
instantly
delivered
it
was
now
athos
s
turn
to
take
a
sly
look
d
artagnan
read
the
letter
with
apparent
calmness
and
said
shaking
his
head
see
dear
friend
what
it
is
to
belong
to
the
army
faith
you
are
indeed
right
not
to
return
to
it
monsieur
de
treville
is
ill
so
my
company
can
t
do
without
me
there
my
leave
is
at
an
end
do
you
return
to
paris
asked
athos
quickly
egad
yes
but
why
don
t
you
come
there
also
athos
colored
a
little
and
answered
should
i
go
i
shall
be
delighted
to
see
you
halloo
planchet
cried
the
gascon
from
the
door
we
must
set
out
in
ten
minutes
give
the
horses
some
then
turning
to
athos
he
added
i
seem
to
miss
something
here
i
am
really
sorry
to
go
away
without
having
seen
grimaud
replied
athos
i
m
surprised
you
have
never
so
much
as
asked
after
him
i
have
lent
him
to
a
friend
who
will
understand
the
signs
he
makes
returned
d
artagnan
i
hope
the
friends
embraced
cordially
d
artagnan
pressed
raoul
s
hand
will
you
not
come
with
me
he

the

waved
his

raoul
bowed
and
d
artagnan
and
planchet
set
out
the
count
followed
them
with
his
eyes
his
hands
resting
on
the
shoulders
of
the
youth
whose
height
was
almost
equal
to
his
own
but
as
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
he
said
raoul
we
set
out
for
eh
cried
the
young
man
turning
pale
you
may
go
and
offer
your
adieux
and
mine
to
madame
de
i
shall
wait
for
you
here
till
the
young
man
bent
low
with
an
expression
of
sorrow
and
gratitude
mingled
and
retired
in
order
to
saddle
his
horse
as
to
d
artagnan
scarcely
on
his
side
was
he
out
of
sight
when
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
letter
which
he
read
over
again
return
immediately
to
j
m
the
epistle
is
laconic
said
d
artagnan
and
if
there
had
not
been
a
postscript
probably
i
should
not
have
understood
it
but
happily
there
is
a
and
he
read
that
welcome
postscript
which
made
him
forget
the
abruptness
of
the
letter
p
go
to
the
king
s
treasurer
at
blois
tell
him
your
name
and
show
him
this
letter
you
will
receive
two
hundred
assuredly
said
d
artagnan
i
admire
this
piece
of
prose
the
cardinal
writes
better
than
i
thought
come
planchet
let
us
pay
a
visit
to
the
king
s
treasurer
and
then
set
toward
paris
sir
toward
and
they
set
out
at
as
hard
a
canter
as
their
horses
could
maintain
the
duc
de
beaufort
the
circumstances
that
had
hastened
the
return
of
d
artagnan
to
paris
were
as
follows
one
evening
when
mazarin
according
to
custom
went
to
visit
the
queen
in
passing
the
he
heard
loud
voices
wishing
to
know
on
what
topic
the
soldiers
were
conversing
he
approached
with
his
wonted
step
pushed
open
the
door
and
put
his
head
close
to
the
chink
there
was
a
dispute
among
the
guards
i
tell
you
one
of
them
was
saying
that
if
coysel
predicted
that
tis
as
good
as
true
i
know
nothing
about
it
but
i
have
heard
say
that
he
s
not
only
an
astrologer
but
a
deuce
take
it
friend
if
he
s
one
of
thy
friends
thou
wilt
ruin
him
in
saying
why
because
he
may
be
tried
for
ah
absurd
they
don
t
burn
sorcerers
no
tis
not
a
long
time
since
the
late
cardinal
burnt
urban
grandier
my
friend
urban
grandier
wasn
t
a
sorcerer
he
was
a
learned
man
he
didn
t
predict
the
future
he
knew
the
past
often
a
more
dangerous
mazarin
nodded
an
assent
but
wishing
to
know
what
this
prediction
was
about
which
they
disputed
he
remained
in
the
same
place
i
don
t
say
resumed
the
guard
that
coysel
is
not
a
sorcerer
but
i
say
that
if
his
prophecy
gets
wind
it
s
a
sure
way
to
prevent
it
s
coming
how
so
why
in
this
way
if
coysel
says
loud
enough
for
the
cardinal
to
hear
him
on
such
or
such
a
day
such
a
prisoner
will
escape
tis
plain
that
the
cardinal
will
take
measures
of
precaution
and
that
the
prisoner
will
not
good
lord
said
another
guard
who
might
have
been
thought
asleep
on
a
bench
but
who
had
lost
not
a
syllable
of
the
conversation
do
you
suppose
that
men
can
escape
their
destiny
if
it
is
written
yonder
in
heaven
that
the
duc
de
beaufort
is
to
escape
he
will
escape
and
all
the
precautions
of
the
cardinal
will
not
prevent
mazarin
started
he
was
an
italian
and
therefore
superstitious
he
walked
straight
into
the
midst
of
the
guards
who
on
seeing
him
were
silent
what
were
you
saying
he
asked
with
his
flattering
manner
that
monsieur
de
beaufort
had
escaped
were
you
not
oh
no
my
lord
said
the
incredulous
soldier
he
s
well
guarded
now
we
only
said
he
would
who
said
so
repeat
your
story
saint
laurent
replied
the
man
turning
to
the
originator
of
the
tale
my
lord
said
the
guard
i
have
simply
mentioned
the
prophecy
i
heard
from
a
man
named
coysel
who
believes
that
be
he
ever
so
closely
watched
and
guarded
the
duke
of
beaufort
will
escape
before
coysel
is
a
madman
returned
the
cardinal
no
replied
the
soldier
tenacious
in
his
credulity
he
has
foretold
many
things
which
have
come
to
pass
for
instance
that
the
queen
would
have
a
son
that
monsieur
coligny
would
be
killed
in
a
duel
with
the
duc
de
guise
and
finally
that
the
coadjutor
would
be
made
cardinal
well
the
queen
has
not
only
one
son
but
two
then
monsieur
de
coligny
was
killed
and
yes
said
mazarin
but
the
coadjutor
is
not
yet
made
cardinal
no
my
lord
but
he
will
be
answered
the
guard
mazarin
made
a
grimace
as
if
he
meant
to
say
but
he
does
not
wear
the
cardinal
s
cap
then
he
added
so
my
friend
it
s
your
opinion
that
monsieur
de
beaufort
will
escape
that
s
my
idea
my
lord
and
if
your
eminence
were
to
offer
to
make
me
at
this
moment
governor
of
the
castle
of
vincennes
i
should
refuse
it
after
whitsuntide
it
would
be
another
there
is
nothing
so
convincing
as
a
firm
conviction
it
has
its
own
effect
upon
the
most
incredulous
and
far
from
being
incredulous
mazarin
was
superstitious
he
went
away
thoughtful
and
anxious
and
returned
to
his
own
room
where
he
summoned
bernouin
and
desired
him
to
fetch
thither
in
the
morning
the
special
guard
he
had
placed
over
monsieur
de
beaufort
and
to
awaken
him
whenever
he
should
arrive
the
guard
had
in
fact
touched
the
cardinal
in
the
tenderest
point
during
the
whole
five
years
in
which
the
duc
de
beaufort
had
been
in
prison
not
a
day
had
passed
in
which
the
cardinal
had
not
felt
a
secret
dread
of
his
escape
it
was
not
possible
as
he
knew
well
to
confine
for
the
whole
of
his
life
the
grandson
of
henry
especially
when
this
young
prince
was
scarcely
thirty
years
of
age
but
however
and
whensoever
he
did
escape
what
hatred
he
must
cherish
against
him
to
whom
he
owed
his
long
imprisonment
who
had
taken
him
rich
brave
glorious
beloved
by
women
feared
by
men
to
cut
off
his
life
s
best
happiest
years
for
it
is
not
life
it
is
merely
existence
in
prison
meantime
mazarin
redoubled
his
surveillance
over
the
duke
but
like
the
miser
in
the
fable
he
could
not
sleep
for
thinking
of
his
treasure
often
he
awoke
in
the
night
suddenly
dreaming
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
then
he
inquired
about
him
and
had
the
vexation
of
hearing
that
the
prisoner
played
drank
sang
but
that
whilst
playing
drinking
singing
he
often
stopped
short
to
vow
that
mazarin
should
pay
dear
for
all
the
amusements
he
had
forced
him
to
enter
into
at
vincennes
so
much
did
this
one
idea
haunt
the
cardinal
even
in
his
sleep
that
when
at
seven
in
the
morning
bernouin
came
to
arouse
him
his
first
words
were
well
what
s
the
matter
has
monsieur
de
beaufort
escaped
from
vincennes
i
do
not
think
so
my
lord
said
bernouin
but
you
will
hear
about
him
for
la
ramee
is
here
and
awaits
the
commands
of
your
tell
him
to
come
in
said
mazarin
arranging
his
pillows
so
that
he
might
receive
the
visitor
sitting
up
in
bed
the
officer
entered
a
large
fat
man
with
an
open
physiognomy
his
air
of
perfect
serenity
made
mazarin
uneasy
approach
sir
said
the
cardinal
the
officer
obeyed
do
you
know
what
they
are
saying
here
no
your
well
they
say
that
monsieur
de
beaufort
is
going
to
escape
from
vincennes
if
he
has
not
done
so
the
officer
s
face
expressed
complete
stupefaction
he
opened
at
once
his
little
eyes
and
his
great
mouth
to
inhale
better
the
joke
his
eminence
deigned
to
address
to
him
and
ended
by
a
burst
of
laughter
so
violent
that
his
great
limbs
shook
in
hilarity
as
they
would
have
done
in
an
ague
escape
my
lord
escape
your
eminence
does
not
then
know
where
monsieur
de
beaufort
is
yes
i
do
sir
in
the
donjon
of
yes
sir
in
a
room
the
walls
of
which
are
seven
feet
thick
with
grated
windows
each
bar
as
thick
as
my
sir
replied
mazarin
with
perseverance
one
may
penetrate
through
a
wall
with
a
one
may
saw
through
an
iron
then
my
lord
does
not
know
that
there
are
eight
guards
about
him
four
in
his
chamber
four
in
the
antechamber
and
that
they
never
leave
but
he
leaves
his
room
he
plays
at
tennis
at
the
mall
sir
those
amusements
are
allowed
but
if
your
eminence
wishes
it
we
will
discontinue
the
no
no
cried
mazarin
fearing
that
should
his
prisoner
ever
leave
his
prison
he
would
be
the
more
exasperated
against
him
if
he
thus
retrenched
his
amusement
he
then
asked
with
whom
he
played
my
lord
either
with
the
officers
of
the
guard
with
the
other
prisoners
or
with
but
does
he
not
approach
the
walls
while
playing
your
eminence
doesn
t
know
those
walls
they
are
sixty
feet
high
and
i
doubt
if
monsieur
de
beaufort
is
sufficiently
weary
of
life
to
risk
his
neck
by
jumping
hum
said
the
cardinal
beginning
to
feel
more
comfortable
you
mean
to
say
then
my
dear
monsieur
la
ramee
that
unless
monsieur
de
beaufort
can
contrive
to
metamorphose
himself
into
a
little
bird
i
will
continue
answerable
for
take
care
you
assert
a
great
deal
said
mazarin
monsieur
de
beaufort
told
the
guards
who
took
him
to
vincennes
that
he
had
often
thought
what
he
should
do
in
case
he
were
put
into
prison
and
that
he
had
found
out
forty
ways
of
my
lord
if
among
these
forty
there
had
been
one
good
way
he
would
have
been
out
long
come
come
not
such
a
fool
as
i
fancied
thought
mazarin
besides
my
lord
must
remember
that
monsieur
de
chavigny
is
governor
of
vincennes
continued
la
ramee
and
that
monsieur
de
chavigny
is
not
friendly
to
monsieur
de
yes
but
monsieur
de
chavigny
is
sometimes
when
he
is
absent
i
am
but
when
you
leave
him
for
instance
oh
when
i
leave
him
i
place
in
my
stead
a
bold
fellow
who
aspires
to
be
his
majesty
s
special
guard
i
promise
you
he
keeps
a
good
watch
over
the
prisoner
during
the
three
weeks
that
he
has
been
with
me
i
have
only
had
to
reproach
him
with
one
thing
being
too
severe
with
the
and
who
is
this
cerberus
a
certain
monsieur
grimaud
my
and
what
was
he
before
he
went
to
vincennes
he
was
in
the
country
as
i
was
told
by
the
person
who
recommended
him
to
and
who
recommended
this
man
to
you
the
steward
of
the
duc
de
he
is
not
a
gossip
i
hope
lord
a
mercy
my
lord
i
thought
for
a
long
time
that
he
was
dumb
he
answers
only
by
signs
it
seems
his
former
master
accustomed
him
to
well
dear
monsieur
la
ramee
replied
the
cardinal
let
him
prove
a
true
and
thankful
keeper
and
we
will
shut
our
eyes
upon
his
rural
misdeeds
and
put
on
his
back
a
uniform
to
make
him
respectable
and
in
the
pockets
of
that
uniform
some
pistoles
to
drink
to
the
king
s
mazarin
was
large
in
promises
quite
unlike
the
virtuous
monsieur
grimaud
so
bepraised
by
la
ramee
for
he
said
nothing
and
did
much
it
was
now
nine
o
clock
the
cardinal
therefore
got
up
perfumed
himself
dressed
and
went
to
the
queen
to
tell
her
what
had
detained
him
the
queen
who
was
scarcely
less
afraid
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
than
the
cardinal
himself
and
who
was
almost
as
superstitious
as
he
was
made
him
repeat
word
for
word
all
la
ramee
s
praises
of
his
deputy
then
when
the
cardinal
had
ended
alas
sir
why
have
we
not
a
grimaud
near
every
prince
patience
replied
mazarin
with
his
italian
smile
that
may
happen
one
day
but
in
the
meantime
well
in
the
meantime
i
shall
still
take
and
he
wrote
to
d
artagnan
to
hasten
his
return
duc
de
beaufort
amused
his
leisure
hours
in
the
donjon
of
vincennes
the
captive
who
was
the
source
of
so
much
alarm
to
the
cardinal
and
whose
means
of
escape
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
whole
court
was
wholly
unconscious
of
the
terror
he
caused
at
the
palais
royal
he
had
found
himself
so
strictly
guarded
that
he
soon
perceived
the
fruitlessness
of
any
attempt
at
escape
his
vengeance
therefore
consisted
in
coining
curses
on
the
head
of
mazarin
he
even
tried
to
make
some
verses
on
him
but
soon
gave
up
the
attempt
for
monsieur
de
beaufort
had
not
only
not
received
from
heaven
the
gift
of
versifying
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
expressing
himself
in
prose
the
duke
was
the
grandson
of
henry
iv
and
gabrielle
d
estrees
as
as
brave
as
proud
and
above
all
as
gascon
as
his
ancestor
but
less
elaborately
educated
after
having
been
for
some
time
after
the
death
of
louis
xiii
the
favorite
the
confidant
the
first
man
in
short
at
the
court
he
had
been
obliged
to
yield
his
place
to
mazarin
and
so
became
the
second
in
influence
and
favor
and
eventually
as
he
was
stupid
enough
to
be
vexed
at
this
change
of
position
the
queen
had
had
him
arrested
and
sent
to
vincennes
in
charge
of
guitant
who
made
his
appearance
in
these
pages
in
the
beginning
of
this
history
and
whom
we
shall
see
again
it
is
understood
of
course
that
when
we
say
the
queen
mazarin
is
meant
during
the
five
years
of
this
seclusion
which
would
have
improved
and
matured
the
intellect
of
any
other
man
de
beaufort
had
he
not
affected
to
brave
the
cardinal
despise
princes
and
walk
alone
without
adherents
or
disciples
would
either
have
regained
his
liberty
or
made
partisans
but
these
considerations
never
occurred
to
the
duke
and
every
day
the
cardinal
received
fresh
accounts
of
him
which
were
as
unpleasant
as
possible
to
the
minister
after
having
failed
in
poetry
monsieur
de
beaufort
tried
drawing
he
drew
portraits
with
a
piece
of
coal
of
the
cardinal
and
as
his
talents
did
not
enable
him
to
produce
a
very
good
likeness
he
wrote
under
the
picture
that
there
might
be
little
doubt
regarding
the
original
portrait
of
the
illustrious
coxcomb
monsieur
de
chavigny
the
governor
of
vincennes
waited
upon
the
duke
to
request
that
he
would
amuse
himself
in
some
other
way
or
that
at
all
events
if
he
drew
likenesses
he
would
not
put
mottoes
underneath
them
the
next
day
the
prisoner
s
room
was
full
of
pictures
and
mottoes
monsieur
de
beaufort
in
common
with
many
other
prisoners
was
bent
upon
doing
things
that
were
prohibited
and
the
only
resource
the
governor
had
was
one
day
when
the
duke
was
playing
at
tennis
to
efface
all
these
drawings
consisting
chiefly
of
profiles
de
beaufort
did
not
venture
to
draw
the
cardinal
s
fat
face
the
duke
thanked
monsieur
de
chavigny
for
having
as
he
said
cleaned
his
for
him
he
then
divided
the
walls
of
his
room
into
compartments
and
dedicated
each
of
these
compartments
to
some
incident
in
mazarin
s
life
in
one
was
depicted
the
illustrious
coxcomb
receiving
a
shower
of
blows
from
cardinal
bentivoglio
whose
servant
he
had
been
another
the
illustrious
mazarin
acting
the
part
of
ignatius
loyola
in
a
tragedy
of
that
name
a
third
the
illustrious
mazarin
stealing
the
portfolio
of
prime
minister
from
monsieur
de
chavigny
who
had
expected
to
have
it
a
fourth
the
illustrious
coxcomb
mazarin
refusing
to
give
laporte
the
young
king
s
valet
clean
sheets
and
saving
that
it
was
quite
enough
for
the
king
of
france
to
have
clean
sheets
every
three
the
governor
of
course
thought
proper
to
threaten
his
prisoner
that
if
he
did
not
give
up
drawing
such
pictures
he
should
be
obliged
to
deprive
him
of
all
the
means
of
amusing
himself
in
that
manner
to
this
monsieur
de
beaufort
replied
that
since
every
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
in
arms
was
taken
from
him
he
wished
to
make
himself
celebrated
in
the
arts
since
he
could
not
be
a
bayard
he
would
become
a
raphael
or
a
michael
angelo
nevertheless
one
day
when
monsieur
de
beaufort
was
walking
in
the
meadow
his
fire
was
put
out
his
charcoal
all
removed
taken
away
and
thus
his
means
of
drawing
utterly
destroyed
the
poor
duke
swore
fell
into
a
rage
yelled
and
declared
that
they
wished
to
starve
him
to
death
as
they
had
starved
the
marechal
ornano
and
the
grand
prior
of
vendome
but
he
refused
to
promise
that
he
would
not
make
any
more
drawings
and
remained
without
any
fire
in
the
room
all
the
winter
his
next
act
was
to
purchase
a
dog
from
one
of
his
keepers
with
this
animal
which
he
called
pistache
he
was
often
shut
up
for
hours
alone
superintending
as
every
one
supposed
its
education
at
last
when
pistache
was
sufficiently
well
trained
monsieur
de
beaufort
invited
the
governor
and
officers
of
vincennes
to
attend
a
representation
which
he
was
going
to
have
in
his
apartment
the
party
assembled
the
room
was
lighted
with
waxlights
and
the
prisoner
with
a
bit
of
plaster
he
had
taken
out
of
the
wall
of
his
room
had
traced
a
long
white
line
representing
a
cord
on
the
floor
pistache
on
a
signal
from
his
master
placed
himself
on
this
line
raised
himself
on
his
hind
paws
and
holding
in
his
front
paws
a
wand
with
which
clothes
used
to
be
beaten
he
began
to
dance
upon
the
line
with
as
many
contortions
as
a
having
been
several
times
up
and
down
it
he
gave
the
wand
back
to
his
master
and
began
without
hesitation
to
perform
the
same
evolutions
over
again
the
intelligent
creature
was
received
with
loud
applause
the
first
part
of
the
entertainment
being
concluded
pistache
was
desired
to
say
what
o
clock
it
was
he
was
shown
monsieur
de
chavigny
s
watch
it
was
then
six
the
dog
raised
and
dropped
his
paw
six
times
the
seventh
he
let
it
remain
upraised
nothing
could
be
better
done
a
could
not
have
shown
the
hour
with
greater
precision
then
the
question
was
put
to
him
who
was
the
best
jailer
in
all
the
prisons
in
france
the
dog
performed
three
evolutions
around
the
circle
and
laid
himself
with
the
deepest
respect
at
the
feet
of
monsieur
de
chavigny
who
at
first
seemed
inclined
to
like
the
joke
and
laughed
long
and
loud
but
a
frown
succeeded
and
he
bit
his
lips
with
vexation
then
the
duke
put
to
pistache
this
difficult
question
who
was
the
greatest
thief
in
the
world
pistache
went
again
around
the
circle
but
stopped
at
no
one
and
at
last
went
to
the
door
and
began
to
scratch
and
bark
see
gentlemen
said
de
beaufort
this
wonderful
animal
not
finding
here
what
i
ask
for
seeks
it
out
of
doors
you
shall
however
have
his
answer
pistache
my
friend
come
here
is
not
the
greatest
thief
in
the
world
monsieur
the
king
s
secretary
le
camus
who
came
to
paris
with
twenty
francs
in
his
pocket
and
who
now
possesses
ten
millions
the
dog
shook
his
head
then
is
it
not
resumed
the
duke
the
superintendent
emery
who
gave
his
son
when
he
was
married
three
hundred
thousand
francs
and
a
house
compared
to
which
the
tuileries
are
a
heap
of
ruins
and
the
louvre
a
paltry
building
the
dog
again
shook
his
head
as
if
to
say
then
said
the
prisoner
let
s
think
who
it
can
be
can
it
be
can
it
possibly
be
the
illustrious
coxcomb
mazarin
de
piscina
hey
pistache
made
violent
signs
that
it
was
by
raising
and
lowering
his
head
eight
or
ten
times
successively
gentlemen
you
see
said
the
duke
to
those
present
who
dared
not
even
smile
that
it
is
the
illustrious
coxcomb
who
is
the
greatest
thief
in
the
world
at
least
according
to
let
us
go
on
to
another
of
his
gentlemen
there
was
a
profound
silence
in
the
room
when
the
duke
again
addressed
them
do
you
not
remember
that
the
duc
de
guise
taught
all
the
dogs
in
paris
to
jump
for
mademoiselle
de
pons
whom
he
styled
the
fairest
of
the
fair
pistache
is
going
to
show
you
how
superior
he
is
to
all
other
dogs
monsieur
de
chavigny
be
so
good
as
to
lend
me
your
monsieur
de
chavigny
handed
his
cane
to
monsieur
de
beaufort
monsieur
de
beaufort
placed
it
horizontally
at
the
height
of
one
foot
now
pistache
my
good
dog
jump
the
height
of
this
cane
for
madame
de
but
interposed
monsieur
de
chavigny
it
seems
to
me
that
pistache
is
only
doing
what
other
dogs
have
done
when
they
jumped
for
mademoiselle
de
stop
said
the
duke
pistache
jump
for
the
and
he
raised
his
cane
six
inches
higher
the
dog
sprang
and
in
spite
of
the
height
jumped
lightly
over
it
and
now
said
the
duke
raising
it
still
six
inches
higher
jump
for
the
the
dog
obeyed
and
jumped
quickly
over
the
cane
now
then
said
the
duke
and
as
he
spoke
lowered
the
cane
almost
level
with
the
ground
pistache
my
friend
jump
for
the
illustrious
coxcomb
mazarin
de
the
dog
turned
his
back
to
the
cane
what
asked
the
duke
what
do
you
mean
and
he
gave
him
the
cane
again
first
making
a
semicircle
from
the
head
to
the
tail
of
pistache
jump
then
monsieur
but
pistache
as
at
first
turned
round
on
his
legs
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
cane
monsieur
de
beaufort
made
the
experiment
a
third
time
but
by
this
time
pistache
s
patience
was
exhausted
he
threw
himself
furiously
upon
the
cane
wrested
it
from
the
hands
of
the
prince
and
broke
it
with
his
teeth
monsieur
de
beaufort
took
the
pieces
out
of
his
mouth
and
presented
them
with
great
formality
to
monsieur
de
chavigny
saying
that
for
that
evening
the
entertainment
was
ended
but
in
three
months
it
should
be
repeated
when
pistache
would
have
learned
a
few
new
tricks
three
days
afterward
pistache
was
found
dead
poisoned
then
the
duke
said
openly
that
his
dog
had
been
killed
by
a
drug
with
which
they
meant
to
poison
him
and
one
day
after
dinner
he
went
to
bed
calling
out
that
he
had
pains
in
his
stomach
and
that
mazarin
had
poisoned
him
this
fresh
impertinence
reached
the
ears
of
the
cardinal
and
alarmed
him
greatly
the
donjon
of
vincennes
was
considered
very
unhealthy
and
madame
de
rambouillet
had
said
that
the
room
in
which
the
marechal
ornano
and
the
grand
prior
de
vendome
had
died
was
worth
its
weight
in
arsenic
a
bon
mot
which
had
great
success
so
it
was
ordered
the
prisoner
was
henceforth
to
eat
nothing
that
had
not
previously
been
tasted
and
la
ramee
was
in
consequence
placed
near
him
as
taster
every
kind
of
revenge
was
practiced
upon
the
duke
by
the
governor
in
return
for
the
insults
of
the
innocent
pistache
de
chavigny
who
according
to
report
was
a
son
of
richelieu
s
and
had
been
a
creature
of
the
late
cardinal
s
understood
tyranny
he
took
from
the
duke
all
the
steel
knives
and
silver
forks
and
replaced
them
with
silver
knives
and
wooden
forks
pretending
that
as
he
had
been
informed
that
the
duke
was
to
pass
all
his
life
at
vincennes
he
was
afraid
of
his
prisoner
attempting
suicide
a
fortnight
afterward
the
duke
going
to
the
tennis
court
found
two
rows
of
trees
about
the
size
of
his
little
finger
planted
by
the
roadside
he
asked
what
they
were
for
and
was
told
that
they
were
to
shade
him
from
the
sun
on
some
future
day
one
morning
the
gardener
went
to
him
and
told
him
as
if
to
please
him
that
he
was
going
to
plant
a
bed
of
asparagus
for
his
especial
use
now
since
as
every
one
knows
asparagus
takes
four
years
in
coming
to
perfection
this
civility
infuriated
monsieur
de
beaufort
at
last
his
patience
was
exhausted
he
assembled
his
keepers
and
notwithstanding
his
difficulty
of
utterance
addressed
them
as
follows
gentlemen
will
you
permit
a
grandson
of
henry
iv
to
be
overwhelmed
with
insults
and
ignominy
odds
fish
as
my
grandfather
used
to
say
i
once
reigned
in
paris
do
you
know
that
i
had
the
king
and
monsieur
the
whole
of
one
day
in
my
care
the
queen
at
that
time
liked
me
and
called
me
the
most
honest
man
in
the
kingdom
gentlemen
and
citizens
set
me
free
i
shall
go
to
the
louvre
and
strangle
mazarin
you
shall
be
my
i
will
make
you
all
captains
with
good
pensions
odds
fish
on
march
forward
but
eloquent
as
he
might
be
the
eloquence
of
the
grandson
of
henry
iv
did
not
touch
those
hearts
of
stone
not
one
man
stirred
so
monsieur
de
beaufort
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
calling
them
all
kinds
of
rascals
underneath
the
sun
sometimes
when
monsieur
de
chavigny
paid
him
a
visit
the
duke
used
to
ask
him
what
he
should
think
if
he
saw
an
army
of
parisians
all
fully
armed
appear
at
vincennes
to
deliver
him
from
prison
my
lord
answered
de
chavigny
with
a
low
bow
i
have
on
the
ramparts
twenty
pieces
of
artillery
and
in
my
casemates
thirty
thousand
guns
i
should
bombard
the
troops
till
not
one
grain
of
gunpowder
was
yes
but
after
you
had
fired
off
your
thirty
thousand
guns
they
would
take
the
donjon
the
donjon
being
taken
i
should
be
obliged
to
let
them
hang
you
at
which
i
should
be
most
unhappy
and
in
his
turn
the
duke
bowed
low
to
monsieur
de
chavigny
for
myself
on
the
other
hand
my
lord
returned
the
governor
when
the
first
rebel
should
pass
the
threshold
of
my
postern
doors
i
should
be
obliged
to
kill
you
with
my
own
hand
since
you
were
confided
peculiarly
to
my
care
and
as
i
am
obliged
to
give
you
up
dead
or
and
once
more
he
bowed
low
before
his
highness
these
pleasantries
lasted
ten
minutes
sometimes
longer
but
always
finished
thus
monsieur
de
chavigny
turning
toward
the
door
used
to
call
out
halloo
la
ramee
la
ramee
came
into
the
room
la
ramee
i
recommend
monsieur
le
duc
to
you
particularly
treat
him
as
a
man
of
his
rank
and
family
ought
to
be
treated
that
is
never
leave
him
alone
an
la
ramee
became
therefore
the
duke
s
dinner
guest
by
compulsion
an
eternal
keeper
the
shadow
of
his
person
but
la
ramee
gay
frank
convivial
fond
of
play
a
great
hand
at
tennis
had
one
defect
in
the
duke
s
eyes
his
incorruptibility
now
although
la
ramee
appreciated
as
of
a
certain
value
the
honor
of
being
shut
up
with
a
prisoner
of
so
great
importance
still
the
pleasure
of
living
in
intimacy
with
the
grandson
of
henry
iv
hardly
compensated
for
the
loss
of
that
which
he
had
experienced
in
going
from
time
to
time
to
visit
his
family
one
may
be
a
jailer
or
a
keeper
and
at
the
same
time
a
good
father
and
husband
la
ramee
adored
his
wife
and
children
whom
now
he
could
only
catch
a
glimpse
of
from
the
top
of
the
wall
when
in
order
to
please
him
they
used
to
walk
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
moat
twas
too
brief
an
enjoyment
and
la
ramee
felt
that
the
gayety
of
heart
he
had
regarded
as
the
cause
of
health
of
which
it
was
perhaps
rather
the
result
would
not
long
survive
such
a
mode
of
life
he
accepted
therefore
with
delight
an
offer
made
to
him
by
his
friend
the
steward
of
the
duc
de
grammont
to
give
him
a
substitute
he
also
spoke
of
it
to
monsieur
de
chavigny
who
promised
that
he
would
not
oppose
it
in
any
way
that
is
if
he
approved
of
the
person
proposed
we
consider
it
useless
to
draw
a
physical
or
moral
portrait
of
grimaud
if
as
we
hope
our
readers
have
not
wholly
forgotten
the
first
part
of
this
work
they
must
have
preserved
a
clear
idea
of
that
estimable
individual
who
is
wholly
unchanged
except
that
he
is
twenty
years
older
an
advance
in
life
that
has
made
him
only
more
silent
although
since
the
change
that
had
been
working
in
himself
athos
had
given
grimaud
permission
to
speak
but
grimaud
had
for
twelve
or
fifteen
years
preserved
habitual
silence
and
a
habit
of
fifteen
or
twenty
years
duration
becomes
second
nature
grimaud
begins
his
functions
grimaud
thereupon
presented
himself
with
his
smooth
exterior
at
the
donjon
of
vincennes
now
monsieur
de
chavigny
piqued
himself
on
his
infallible
penetration
for
that
which
almost
proved
that
he
was
the
son
of
richelieu
was
his
everlasting
pretension
he
examined
attentively
the
countenance
of
the
applicant
for
place
and
fancied
that
the
contracted
eyebrows
thin
lips
hooked
nose
and
prominent
of
grimaud
were
favorable
signs
he
addressed
about
twelve
words
to
him
grimaud
answered
in
four
here
s
a
promising
fellow
and
it
is
i
who
have
found
out
his
merits
said
monsieur
de
chavigny
go
he
added
and
make
yourself
agreeable
to
monsieur
la
ramee
and
tell
him
that
you
suit
me
in
all
grimaud
had
every
quality
that
could
attract
a
man
on
duty
who
wishes
to
have
a
deputy
so
after
a
thousand
questions
which
met
with
only
a
word
in
reply
la
ramee
fascinated
by
this
sobriety
in
speech
rubbed
his
hands
and
engaged
grimaud
my
orders
asked
grimaud
they
are
these
never
to
leave
the
prisoner
alone
to
keep
away
from
him
every
pointed
or
cutting
instrument
and
to
prevent
his
conversing
any
length
of
time
with
the
those
are
all
asked
grimaud
all
now
replied
la
ramee
good
answered
grimaud
and
he
went
right
to
the
prisoner
the
duke
was
in
the
act
of
combing
his
beard
which
he
had
allowed
to
grow
as
well
as
his
hair
in
order
to
reproach
mazarin
with
his
wretched
appearance
and
condition
but
having
some
days
previously
seen
from
the
top
of
the
donjon
madame
de
montbazon
pass
in
her
carriage
and
still
cherishing
an
affection
for
that
beautiful
woman
he
did
not
wish
to
be
to
her
what
he
wished
to
be
to
mazarin
and
in
the
hope
of
seeing
her
again
had
asked
for
a
leaden
comb
which
was
allowed
him
the
comb
was
to
be
a
leaden
one
because
his
beard
like
that
of
most
fair
people
was
rather
red
he
therefore
dyed
it
thus
whilst
combing
it
as
grimaud
entered
he
saw
this
comb
on
the
he
took
it
up
and
as
he
took
it
he
made
a
low
bow
the
duke
looked
at
this
strange
figure
with
surprise
the
figure
put
the
comb
in
its
pocket
ho
hey
what
s
that
cried
the
duke
who
is
this
creature
grimaud
did
not
answer
but
bowed
a
second
time
art
thou
dumb
cried
the
duke
grimaud
made
a
sign
that
he
was
not
what
art
thou
then
answer
i
command
thee
said
the
duke
a
keeper
replied
grimaud
a
keeper
reiterated
the
duke
there
was
nothing
wanting
in
my
collection
except
this
halloo
la
ramee
some
one
la
ramee
ran
in
haste
to
obey
the
call
who
is
this
wretch
who
takes
my
comb
and
puts
it
in
his
pocket
asked
the
duke
one
of
your
guards
my
prince
a
man
of
talent
and
merit
whom
you
will
like
as
i
and
monsieur
de
chavigny
do
i
am
why
does
he
take
my
comb
why
do
you
take
my
lord
s
comb
asked
la
ramee
grimaud
drew
the
comb
from
his
pocket
and
passing
his
fingers
over
the
largest
teeth
pronounced
this
one
word
true
said
la
ramee
what
does
the
animal
say
asked
the
duke
that
the
king
has
forbidden
your
lordship
to
have
any
pointed
are
you
mad
la
ramee
you
yourself
gave
me
this
i
was
very
wrong
my
lord
for
in
giving
it
to
you
i
acted
in
opposition
to
my
the
duke
looked
furiously
at
grimaud
i
perceive
that
this
creature
will
be
my
particular
aversion
he
muttered
grimaud
nevertheless
was
resolved
for
certain
reasons
not
at
once
to
come
to
a
full
rupture
with
the
prisoner
he
wanted
to
inspire
not
a
sudden
repugnance
but
a
good
sound
steady
hatred
he
retired
therefore
and
gave
place
to
four
guards
who
having
breakfasted
could
attend
on
the
prisoner
a
fresh
practical
joke
now
occurred
to
the
duke
he
had
asked
for
crawfish
for
his
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
he
intended
to
pass
the
day
in
making
a
small
gallows
and
hang
one
of
the
finest
of
these
fish
in
the
middle
of
his
room
the
red
color
evidently
conveying
an
allusion
to
the
cardinal
so
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
hanging
mazarin
in
effigy
without
being
accused
of
having
hung
anything
more
significant
than
a
crawfish
the
day
was
employed
in
preparations
for
the
execution
every
one
grows
childish
in
prison
but
the
character
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
was
particularly
disposed
to
become
so
in
the
course
of
his
morning
s
walk
he
collected
two
or
three
small
branches
from
a
tree
and
found
a
small
piece
of
broken
glass
a
discovery
that
quite
delighted
him
when
he
came
home
he
formed
his
handkerchief
into
a
loop
nothing
of
all
this
escaped
grimaud
but
la
ramee
looked
on
with
the
curiosity
of
a
father
who
thinks
that
he
may
perhaps
get
a
cheap
idea
concerning
a
new
toy
for
his
children
the
guards
looked
on
it
with
indifference
when
everything
was
ready
the
gallows
hung
in
the
middle
of
the
room
the
loop
made
and
when
the
duke
had
cast
a
glance
upon
the
plate
of
crawfish
in
order
to
select
the
finest
specimen
among
them
he
looked
around
for
his
piece
of
glass
it
had
disappeared
who
has
taken
my
piece
of
glass
asked
the
duke
frowning
grimaud
made
a
sign
to
denote
that
he
had
done
so
what
thou
again
why
didst
thou
take
it
yes
why
asked
la
ramee
grimaud
who
held
the
piece
of
glass
in
his
hand
said
true
my
lord
exclaimed
la
ramee
ah
deuce
take
it
we
have
a
precious
fellow
here
monsieur
grimaud
said
the
duke
for
your
sake
i
beg
of
you
never
come
within
the
reach
of
my
fist
hush
hush
cried
la
ramee
give
me
your
gibbet
my
lord
i
will
shape
it
out
for
you
with
my
and
he
took
the
gibbet
and
shaped
it
out
as
neatly
as
possible
that
s
it
said
the
duke
now
make
me
a
little
hole
in
the
floor
whilst
i
go
and
fetch
the
la
ramee
knelt
down
and
made
a
hole
in
the
floor
meanwhile
the
duke
hung
the
crawfish
up
by
a
thread
then
he
placed
the
gibbet
in
the
middle
of
the
room
bursting
with
laughter
la
ramee
laughed
also
and
the
guards
laughed
in
chorus
grimaud
however
did
not
even
smile
he
approached
la
ramee
and
showing
him
the
crawfish
hung
up
by
the
thread
cardinal
he
said
hung
by
order
of
his
highness
the
duc
de
beaufort
cried
the
prisoner
laughing
violently
and
by
master
jacques
chrysostom
la
ramee
the
king
s
la
ramee
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
and
rushed
toward
the
gibbet
which
he
broke
at
once
and
threw
the
pieces
out
of
the
window
he
was
going
to
throw
the
crawfish
out
also
when
grimaud
snatched
it
from
his
hands
good
to
eat
he
said
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
this
scene
so
enchanted
the
duke
that
at
the
moment
he
forgave
grimaud
for
his
part
in
it
but
on
reflection
he
hated
him
more
and
more
being
convinced
he
had
some
evil
motive
for
his
conduct
but
the
story
of
the
crab
made
a
great
noise
through
the
interior
of
the
donjon
and
even
outside
monsieur
de
chavigny
who
at
heart
detested
the
cardinal
took
pains
to
tell
the
story
to
two
or
three
friends
who
put
it
into
immediate
circulation
the
prisoner
happened
to
remark
among
the
guards
one
man
with
a
very
good
countenance
and
he
favored
this
man
the
more
as
grimaud
became
the
more
and
more
odious
to
him
one
morning
he
took
this
man
on
one
side
and
had
succeeded
in
speaking
to
him
when
grimaud
entered
and
seeing
what
was
going
on
approached
the
duke
respectfully
but
took
the
guard
by
the
arm
go
away
he
said
the
guard
obeyed
you
are
insupportable
cried
the
duke
i
shall
beat
grimaud
bowed
i
will
break
every
bone
in
your
body
cried
the
duke
grimaud
bowed
but
stepped
back
mr
spy
cried
the
duke
more
and
more
enraged
i
will
strangle
you
with
my
own
and
he
extended
his
hands
toward
grimaud
who
merely
thrust
the
guard
out
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
at
the
same
time
he
felt
the
duke
s
arms
on
his
shoulders
like
two
iron
claws
but
instead
either
of
calling
out
or
defending
himself
he
placed
his
forefinger
on
his
lips
and
said
in
a
low
tone
hush
smiling
as
he
uttered
the
word
a
gesture
a
smile
and
a
word
from
grimaud
all
at
once
were
so
unusual
that
his
highness
stopped
short
astounded
grimaud
took
advantage
of
that
instant
to
draw
from
his
vest
a
charming
little
note
with
an
aristocratic
seal
and
presented
it
to
the
duke
without
a
word
the
duke
more
and
more
bewildered
let
grimaud
loose
and
took
the
note
from
madame
de
montbazon
he
cried
grimaud
nodded
assent
the
duke
tore
open
the
note
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
for
he
was
dazzled
and
confused
and
read
my
dear
duke
you
may
entirely
confide
in
the
brave
lad
who
will
give
you
this
note
he
has
consented
to
enter
the
service
of
your
keeper
and
to
shut
himself
up
at
vincennes
with
you
in
order
to
prepare
and
assist
your
escape
which
we
are
contriving
the
moment
of
your
deliverance
is
at
hand
have
patience
and
courage
and
remember
that
in
spite
of
time
and
absence
all
your
friends
continue
to
cherish
for
you
the
sentiments
they
have
so
long
professed
and
truly
entertained
yours
wholly
and
most
affectionately
marie
de
montbazon
i
sign
my
full
name
for
i
should
be
vain
if
i
could
suppose
that
after
five
years
of
absence
you
would
remember
my
the
poor
duke
became
perfectly
giddy
what
for
five
years
he
had
been
wanting
a
faithful
servant
a
friend
a
helping
hand
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
heaven
just
when
he
expected
it
the
least
oh
dearest
marie
she
thinks
of
me
then
after
five
years
of
separation
heavens
there
is
constancy
then
turning
to
grimaud
he
said
and
thou
my
brave
fellow
thou
consentest
thus
to
aid
me
grimaud
signified
his
assent
and
you
have
come
here
with
that
purpose
grimaud
repeated
the
sign
and
i
was
ready
to
strangle
you
cried
the
duke
grimaud
smiled
wait
then
said
the
duke
fumbling
in
his
pocket
wait
he
continued
renewing
his
fruitless
search
it
shall
not
be
said
that
such
devotion
to
a
grandson
of
henry
iv
went
without
the
duke
s
endeavors
evinced
the
best
intention
in
the
world
but
one
of
the
precautions
taken
at
vincennes
was
that
of
allowing
prisoners
to
keep
no
money
whereupon
grimaud
observing
the
duke
s
disappointment
drew
from
his
pocket
a
purse
filled
with
gold
and
handed
it
to
him
here
is
what
you
are
looking
for
he
said
the
duke
opened
the
purse
and
wanted
to
empty
it
into
grimaud
s
hands
but
grimaud
shook
his
head
thank
you
monseigneur
he
said
drawing
back
i
am
the
duke
went
from
one
surprise
to
another
he
held
out
his
hand
grimaud
drew
near
and
kissed
it
respectfully
the
grand
manner
of
athos
had
left
its
mark
on
grimaud
what
shall
we
do
and
when
and
how
proceed
it
is
now
eleven
answered
grimaud
let
my
lord
at
two
o
clock
ask
leave
to
make
up
a
game
at
tennis
with
la
ramee
and
let
him
send
two
or
three
balls
over
the
and
then
your
highness
will
approach
the
walls
and
call
out
to
a
man
who
works
in
the
moat
to
send
them
back
i
understand
said
the
duke
grimaud
made
a
sign
that
he
was
going
away
ah
cried
the
duke
will
you
not
accept
any
money
from
me
i
wish
my
lord
would
make
me
one
what
speak
tis
this
when
we
escape
together
that
i
shall
go
everywhere
and
be
always
first
for
if
my
lord
should
be
overtaken
and
caught
there
s
every
chance
of
his
being
brought
back
to
prison
whereas
if
i
am
caught
the
least
that
can
befall
me
is
to
be
true
on
my
honor
as
a
gentleman
it
shall
be
as
thou
dost
now
resumed
grimaud
i
ve
only
one
thing
more
to
ask
that
your
highness
will
continue
to
detest
i
ll
try
said
the
duke
at
this
moment
la
ramee
after
the
interview
we
have
described
with
the
cardinal
entered
the
room
the
duke
had
thrown
himself
as
he
was
wont
to
do
in
moments
of
dullness
and
vexation
on
his
bed
la
ramee
cast
an
inquiring
look
around
him
and
observing
the
same
signs
of
antipathy
between
the
prisoner
and
his
guardian
he
smiled
in
token
of
his
inward
satisfaction
then
turning
to
grimaud
very
good
my
friend
very
good
you
have
been
spoken
of
in
a
promising
quarter
and
you
will
soon
i
hope
have
news
that
will
be
agreeable
to
grimaud
saluted
in
his
politest
manner
and
withdrew
as
was
his
custom
on
the
entrance
of
his
superior
well
my
lord
said
la
ramee
with
his
rude
laugh
you
still
set
yourself
against
this
poor
fellow
so
tis
you
la
ramee
in
faith
tis
time
you
came
back
again
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
turned
my
nose
to
the
wall
that
i
mightn
t
break
my
promise
and
strangle
i
doubt
however
said
la
ramee
in
sprightly
allusion
to
the
silence
of
his
subordinate
if
he
has
said
anything
disagreeable
to
your
pardieu
you
are
right
a
mute
from
the
east
i
swear
it
was
time
for
you
to
come
back
la
ramee
and
i
was
eager
to
see
you
monseigneur
is
too
good
said
la
ramee
flattered
by
the
compliment
yes
continued
the
duke
really
i
feel
bored
today
beyond
the
power
of
then
let
us
have
a
match
in
the
tennis
court
exclaimed
la
ramee
if
you
wish
i
am
at
your
service
my
i
protest
my
dear
la
ramee
said
the
duke
that
you
are
a
charming
fellow
and
that
i
would
stay
forever
at
vincennes
to
have
the
pleasure
of
your
my
lord
replied
la
ramee
i
think
if
it
depended
on
the
cardinal
your
wishes
would
be
what
do
you
mean
have
you
seen
him
lately
he
sent
for
me
really
to
speak
to
you
about
me
of
what
else
do
you
imagine
he
would
speak
to
me
really
my
lord
you
are
his
the
duke
smiled
with
bitterness
ah
la
ramee
if
you
would
but
accept
my
offers
i
would
make
your
how
you
would
no
sooner
have
left
prison
than
your
goods
would
be
i
shall
no
sooner
be
out
of
prison
than
i
shall
be
master
of
pshaw
pshaw
i
can
not
hear
such
things
said
as
that
this
is
a
fine
conversation
with
an
officer
of
the
king
i
see
my
lord
i
shall
be
obliged
to
fetch
a
second
grimaud
very
well
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
so
you
and
the
cardinal
have
been
talking
about
me
la
ramee
some
day
when
he
sends
for
you
you
must
let
me
put
on
your
clothes
i
will
go
in
your
stead
i
will
strangle
him
and
upon
my
honor
if
that
is
made
a
condition
i
will
return
to
monseigneur
i
see
well
that
i
must
call
well
i
am
wrong
and
what
did
the
cuistre
pettifogger
say
about
me
i
admit
the
word
monseigneur
because
it
rhymes
with
ministre
minister
what
did
he
say
to
me
he
told
me
to
watch
and
why
so
why
watch
me
asked
the
duke
uneasily
because
an
astrologer
had
predicted
that
you
would
ah
an
astrologer
predicted
that
said
the
duke
starting
in
spite
of
himself
oh
mon
dieu
yes
those
imbeciles
of
magicians
can
only
imagine
things
to
torment
honest
and
what
did
you
reply
to
his
most
illustrious
eminence
that
if
the
astrologer
in
question
made
almanacs
i
would
advise
him
not
to
buy
why
not
because
before
you
could
escape
you
would
have
to
be
turned
into
a
unfortunately
that
is
true
let
us
go
and
have
a
game
at
tennis
la
my
lord
i
beg
your
highness
s
pardon
but
i
must
beg
for
half
an
hour
s
leave
of
why
because
monseigneur
mazarin
is
a
prouder
man
than
his
highness
though
not
of
such
high
birth
he
forgot
to
ask
me
to
well
shall
i
send
for
some
breakfast
here
no
my
lord
i
must
tell
you
that
the
confectioner
who
lived
opposite
the
castle
daddy
marteau
as
they
called
him
well
well
he
sold
his
business
a
week
ago
to
a
confectioner
from
paris
an
invalid
ordered
country
air
for
his
well
what
have
i
to
do
with
that
why
good
lord
this
man
your
highness
when
he
saw
me
stop
before
his
shop
where
he
has
a
display
of
things
which
would
make
your
mouth
water
my
lord
asked
me
to
get
him
the
custom
of
the
prisoners
in
the
donjon
i
bought
said
he
the
business
of
my
predecessor
on
the
strength
of
his
assurance
that
he
supplied
the
castle
whereas
on
my
honor
monsieur
de
chavigny
though
i
ve
been
here
a
week
has
not
ordered
so
much
as
a
but
i
then
replied
probably
monsieur
de
chavigny
is
afraid
your
pastry
is
not
my
pastry
not
good
well
monsieur
la
ramee
you
shall
judge
of
it
yourself
and
at
i
can
not
i
replied
it
is
absolutely
necessary
for
me
to
return
to
the
very
well
said
he
go
and
attend
to
your
affairs
since
you
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
but
come
back
in
half
an
in
half
an
hour
yes
have
you
breakfasted
faith
well
here
is
a
pate
that
will
be
ready
for
you
with
a
bottle
of
old
so
you
see
my
lord
since
i
am
hungry
i
would
with
your
highness
s
leave
and
la
ramee
bent
low
go
then
animal
said
the
duke
but
remember
i
only
allow
you
half
an
may
i
promise
your
custom
to
the
successor
of
father
marteau
my
lord
yes
if
he
does
not
put
mushrooms
in
his
pies
thou
knowest
that
mushrooms
from
the
wood
of
vincennes
are
fatal
to
my
la
ramee
went
out
but
in
five
minutes
one
of
the
officers
of
the
guard
entered
in
compliance
with
the
strict
orders
of
the
cardinal
that
the
prisoner
should
never
be
left
alone
a
moment
but
during
these
five
minutes
the
duke
had
had
time
to
read
again
the
note
from
madame
de
montbazon
which
proved
to
the
prisoner
that
his
friends
were
concerting
plans
for
his
deliverance
but
in
what
way
he
knew
not
but
his
confidence
in
grimaud
whose
petty
persecutions
he
now
perceived
were
only
a
blind
increased
and
he
conceived
the
highest
opinion
of
his
intellect
and
resolved
to
trust
entirely
to
his
guidance
pates
made
by
the
successor
of
father
marteau
are
described
in
half
an
hour
la
ramee
returned
full
of
glee
like
most
men
who
have
eaten
and
more
especially
drank
to
their
heart
s
content
the
pates
were
excellent
the
wine
delicious
the
weather
was
fine
and
the
game
at
tennis
took
place
in
the
open
air
at
two
o
clock
the
tennis
balls
began
according
to
grimaud
s
directions
to
take
the
direction
of
the
moat
much
to
the
joy
of
la
ramee
who
marked
fifteen
whenever
the
duke
sent
a
ball
into
the
moat
and
very
soon
balls
were
wanting
so
many
had
gone
over
la
ramee
then
proposed
to
send
some
one
to
pick
them
up
but
the
duke
remarked
that
it
would
be
losing
time
and
going
near
the
rampart
himself
and
looking
over
he
saw
a
man
working
in
one
of
the
numerous
little
gardens
cleared
out
by
the
peasants
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
moat
hey
friend
cried
the
duke
the
man
raised
his
head
and
the
duke
was
about
to
utter
a
cry
of
surprise
the
peasant
the
gardener
was
rochefort
whom
he
believed
to
be
in
the
bastile
well
who
s
up
there
said
the
man
be
so
good
as
to
collect
and
throw
us
back
our
balls
said
the
duke
the
gardener
nodded
and
began
to
fling
up
the
balls
which
were
picked
up
by
la
ramee
and
the
guard
one
however
fell
at
the
duke
s
feet
and
seeing
that
it
was
intended
for
him
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
la
ramee
was
in
ecstasies
at
having
beaten
a
prince
of
the
blood
the
duke
went
indoors
and
retired
to
bed
where
he
spent
indeed
the
greater
part
of
every
day
as
they
had
taken
his
books
away
la
ramee
carried
off
all
his
clothes
in
order
to
be
certain
that
the
duke
would
not
stir
however
the
duke
contrived
to
hide
the
ball
under
his
bolster
and
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
he
tore
off
the
cover
of
the
ball
with
his
teeth
and
found
underneath
the
following
letter
my
lord
your
friends
are
watching
over
you
and
the
hour
of
your
deliverance
is
at
hand
ask
day
after
to
have
a
pie
supplied
you
by
the
new
confectioner
opposite
the
castle
and
who
is
no
other
than
noirmont
your
former
maitre
d
hotel
do
not
open
the
pie
till
you
are
alone
i
hope
you
will
be
satisfied
with
its
contents
your
highness
s
most
devoted
servant
in
the
bastile
as
elsewhere
comte
de
the
duke
who
had
latterly
been
allowed
a
fire
burned
the
letter
but
kept
the
ball
and
went
to
bed
hiding
the
ball
under
his
bolster
la
ramee
entered
he
smiled
kindly
on
the
prisoner
for
he
was
an
excellent
man
and
had
taken
a
great
liking
for
the
captive
prince
he
endeavored
to
cheer
him
up
in
his
solitude
ah
my
friend
cried
the
duke
you
are
so
good
if
i
could
but
do
as
you
do
and
eat
pates
and
drink
burgundy
at
the
house
of
father
marteau
s
tis
true
my
lord
answered
la
ramee
that
his
pates
are
famous
and
his
wine
in
any
case
said
the
duke
his
cellar
and
kitchen
might
easily
excel
those
of
monsieur
de
well
my
lord
said
la
ramee
falling
into
the
trap
what
is
there
to
prevent
your
trying
them
besides
i
have
promised
him
your
you
are
right
said
the
duke
if
i
am
to
remain
here
permanently
as
monsieur
mazarin
has
kindly
given
me
to
understand
i
must
provide
myself
with
a
diversion
for
my
old
age
i
must
turn
my
lord
said
la
ramee
if
you
will
take
a
bit
of
good
advice
don
t
put
that
off
till
you
are
good
said
the
duc
de
beaufort
to
himself
every
man
in
order
that
he
may
lose
his
heart
and
soul
must
receive
from
celestial
bounty
one
of
the
seven
capital
sins
perhaps
two
it
seems
that
master
la
ramee
s
is
gluttony
let
us
then
take
advantage
of
then
aloud
well
my
dear
la
ramee
the
day
after
is
a
yes
my
lord
will
you
give
me
a
lesson
the
day
after
in
what
in
gastronomy
willingly
my
but
send
the
guards
to
take
their
meal
in
the
canteen
of
monsieur
de
chavigny
we
ll
have
a
supper
here
under
your
hum
said
la
ramee
the
proposal
was
seductive
but
la
ramee
was
an
old
stager
acquainted
with
all
the
traps
a
prisoner
was
likely
to
set
monsieur
de
beaufort
had
said
that
he
had
forty
ways
of
getting
out
of
prison
did
this
proposed
breakfast
cover
some
stratagem
he
reflected
but
he
remembered
that
he
himself
would
have
charge
of
the
food
and
the
wine
and
therefore
that
no
powder
could
be
mixed
with
the
food
no
drug
with
the
wine
as
to
getting
him
drunk
the
duke
couldn
t
hope
to
do
that
and
he
laughed
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
then
an
idea
came
to
him
which
harmonized
everything
the
duke
had
followed
with
anxiety
la
ramee
s
unspoken
soliloquy
reading
it
from
point
to
point
upon
his
face
but
presently
the
exempt
s
face
suddenly
brightened
well
he
asked
that
will
do
will
it
not
yes
my
lord
on
one
what
that
grimaud
shall
wait
on
us
at
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
the
duke
however
he
had
presence
of
mind
enough
to
exclaim
to
the
devil
with
your
grimaud
he
will
spoil
the
i
will
direct
him
to
stand
behind
your
chair
and
since
he
doesn
t
speak
your
highness
will
neither
see
nor
hear
him
and
with
a
little
effort
can
imagine
him
a
hundred
miles
do
you
know
my
friend
i
find
one
thing
very
evident
in
all
this
you
distrust
my
lord
the
day
after
is
well
what
is
pentecost
to
me
are
you
afraid
that
the
holy
spirit
will
come
as
a
tongue
of
fire
to
open
the
doors
of
my
prison
no
my
lord
but
i
have
already
told
you
what
that
damned
magician
and
what
was
it
that
the
day
of
pentecost
would
not
pass
without
your
highness
being
out
of
you
believe
in
sorcerers
then
you
fool
i
mind
them
no
more
than
that
and
he
snapped
his
fingers
but
it
is
my
lord
giulio
who
cares
about
them
as
an
italian
he
is
the
duke
shrugged
his
shoulders
well
then
with
well
acted
i
allow
grimaud
but
no
one
else
you
must
manage
it
all
order
whatever
you
like
for
supper
the
only
thing
i
specify
is
one
of
those
pies
and
tell
the
confectioner
that
i
will
promise
him
my
custom
if
he
excels
this
time
in
his
pies
not
only
now
but
when
i
leave
my
then
you
think
you
will
some
day
leave
it
said
la
ramee
the
devil
replied
the
prince
surely
at
the
death
of
mazarin
i
am
fifteen
years
younger
than
he
is
at
vincennes
tis
true
one
lives
faster
my
lord
replied
la
ramee
my
lord
or
dies
sooner
for
it
comes
to
the
same
la
ramee
was
going
out
he
stopped
however
at
the
door
for
an
instant
whom
does
your
highness
wish
me
to
send
to
you
any
one
except
the
officer
of
the
guard
then
with
his
chessboard
five
minutes
afterward
the
officer
entered
and
the
duke
seemed
to
be
immersed
in
the
sublime
combinations
of
chess
a
strange
thing
is
the
mind
and
it
is
wonderful
what
revolutions
may
be
wrought
in
it
by
a
sign
a
word
a
hope
the
duke
had
been
five
years
in
prison
and
now
to
him
looking
back
upon
them
those
five
years
which
had
passed
so
slowly
seemed
not
so
long
a
time
as
were
the
two
days
the
hours
which
still
parted
him
from
the
time
fixed
for
his
escape
besides
there
was
one
thing
that
engaged
his
most
anxious
thought
in
what
way
was
the
escape
to
be
effected
they
had
told
him
to
hope
for
it
but
had
not
told
him
what
was
to
be
hidden
in
the
mysterious
pate
and
what
friends
awaited
him
without
he
had
friends
then
after
five
years
in
prison
if
that
were
so
he
was
indeed
a
highly
favored
prince
he
forgot
that
besides
his
friends
of
his
own
sex
a
woman
strange
to
say
had
remembered
him
it
is
true
that
she
had
not
perhaps
been
scrupulously
faithful
to
him
but
she
had
remembered
him
that
was
something
so
the
duke
had
more
than
enough
to
think
about
accordingly
he
fared
at
chess
as
he
had
fared
at
tennis
he
made
blunder
upon
blunder
and
the
officer
with
whom
he
played
found
him
easy
game
but
his
successive
defeats
did
service
to
the
duke
in
one
way
they
killed
time
for
him
till
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
then
would
come
night
and
with
night
sleep
so
at
least
the
duke
believed
but
sleep
is
a
capricious
fairy
and
it
is
precisely
when
one
invokes
her
presence
that
she
is
most
likely
to
keep
him
waiting
the
duke
waited
until
midnight
turning
on
his
mattress
like
laurence
on
his
gridiron
finally
he
slept
but
at
daybreak
he
awoke
wild
dreams
had
disturbed
his
repose
he
dreamed
that
he
was
endowed
with
wings
he
wished
to
fly
away
for
a
time
these
wings
supported
him
but
when
he
reached
a
certain
height
this
new
aid
failed
him
his
wings
were
broken
and
he
seemed
to
sink
into
a
bottomless
abyss
whence
he
awoke
bathed
in
perspiration
and
nearly
as
much
overcome
as
if
he
had
really
fallen
he
fell
asleep
again
and
another
vision
appeared
he
was
in
a
subterranean
passage
by
which
he
was
to
leave
vincennes
grimaud
was
walking
before
him
with
a
lantern
by
degrees
the
passage
narrowed
yet
the
duke
continued
his
course
at
last
it
became
so
narrow
that
the
fugitive
tried
in
vain
to
proceed
the
sides
of
the
walls
seem
to
close
in
even
to
press
against
him
he
made
fruitless
efforts
to
go
on
it
was
impossible
nevertheless
he
still
saw
grimaud
with
his
lantern
in
front
advancing
he
wished
to
call
out
to
him
but
could
not
utter
a
word
then
at
the
other
extremity
he
heard
the
footsteps
of
those
who
were
pursuing
him
these
steps
came
on
came
fast
he
was
discovered
all
hope
of
flight
was
gone
still
the
walls
seemed
to
be
closing
on
him
they
appeared
to
be
in
concert
with
his
enemies
at
last
he
heard
the
voice
of
la
ramee
la
ramee
took
his
hand
and
laughed
aloud
he
was
captured
again
and
conducted
to
the
low
and
vaulted
chamber
in
which
ornano
puylaurens
and
his
uncle
had
died
their
three
graves
were
there
rising
above
the
ground
and
a
fourth
was
also
there
yawning
for
its
ghastly
tenant
the
duke
was
obliged
to
make
as
many
efforts
to
awake
as
he
had
done
to
go
to
sleep
and
la
ramee
found
him
so
pale
and
fatigued
that
he
inquired
whether
he
was
in
fact
said
one
of
the
guards
who
had
remained
in
the
chamber
and
had
been
kept
awake
by
a
toothache
brought
on
by
the
dampness
of
the
atmosphere
my
lord
has
had
a
very
restless
night
and
two
or
three
times
while
dreaming
he
called
for
what
is
the
matter
with
your
highness
asked
la
ramee
tis
your
fault
you
simpleton
answered
the
duke
with
your
idle
nonsense
yesterday
about
escaping
you
worried
me
so
that
i
dreamed
that
i
was
trying
to
escape
and
broke
my
neck
in
doing
la
ramee
laughed
come
he
said
tis
a
warning
from
heaven
never
commit
such
an
imprudence
as
to
try
to
escape
except
in
your
and
you
are
right
my
dear
la
ramee
said
the
duke
wiping
away
the
sweat
that
stood
on
his
brow
wide
awake
though
he
was
after
this
i
will
think
of
nothing
but
eating
and
hush
said
la
ramee
and
one
by
one
he
sent
away
the
guards
on
various
pretexts
well
asked
the
duke
when
they
were
alone
well
replied
la
ramee
your
supper
is
ah
and
what
is
it
to
be
monsieur
my
majordomo
will
there
be
a
pie
i
should
think
so
indeed
almost
as
high
as
a
you
told
him
it
was
for
me
yes
and
he
said
he
would
do
his
best
to
please
your
good
exclaimed
the
duke
rubbing
his
hands
devil
take
it
my
lord
what
a
gourmand
you
are
growing
i
haven
t
seen
you
with
so
cheerful
a
face
these
five
the
duke
saw
that
he
had
not
controlled
himself
as
he
ought
but
at
that
moment
as
if
he
had
listened
at
the
door
and
comprehended
the
urgent
need
of
diverting
la
ramee
s
ideas
grimaud
entered
and
made
a
sign
to
la
ramee
that
he
had
something
to
say
to
him
la
ramee
drew
near
to
grimaud
who
spoke
to
him
in
a
low
voice
the
duke
meanwhile
recovered
his
i
have
already
forbidden
that
man
he
said
to
come
in
here
without
my
you
must
pardon
him
my
lord
said
la
ramee
for
i
directed
him
to
and
why
did
you
so
direct
when
you
know
that
he
displeases
me
my
lord
will
remember
that
it
was
agreed
between
us
that
he
should
wait
upon
us
at
that
famous
supper
my
lord
has
forgotten
the
no
but
i
have
forgotten
monsieur
my
lord
understands
that
there
can
be
no
supper
unless
he
is
allowed
to
be
go
on
then
have
it
your
own
come
here
my
lad
said
la
ramee
and
hear
what
i
have
to
grimaud
approached
with
a
very
sullen
expression
on
his
face
la
ramee
continued
my
lord
has
done
me
the
honor
to
invite
me
to
a
supper
en
grimaud
made
a
sign
which
meant
that
he
didn
t
see
what
that
had
to
do
with
him
yes
yes
said
la
ramee
the
matter
concerns
you
for
you
will
have
the
honor
to
serve
us
and
besides
however
good
an
appetite
we
may
have
and
however
great
our
thirst
there
will
be
something
left
on
the
plates
and
in
the
bottles
and
that
something
will
be
grimaud
bowed
in
thanks
and
now
said
la
ramee
i
must
ask
your
highness
s
pardon
but
it
seems
that
monsieur
de
chavigny
is
to
be
away
for
a
few
days
and
he
has
sent
me
word
that
he
has
certain
directions
to
give
me
before
his
the
duke
tried
to
exchange
a
glance
with
grimaud
but
there
was
no
glance
in
grimaud
s
eyes
go
then
said
the
duke
and
return
as
soon
as
does
your
highness
wish
to
take
revenge
for
the
game
of
tennis
yesterday
grimaud
intimated
by
a
scarcely
perceptible
nod
that
he
should
consent
yes
said
the
duke
but
take
care
my
dear
la
ramee
for
i
propose
to
beat
you
la
ramee
went
out
grimaud
looked
after
him
and
when
the
door
was
closed
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
pencil
and
a
sheet
of
paper
write
my
lord
he
said
and
what
grimaud
dictated
all
is
ready
for
evening

seven
to
nine

two
riding
horses
ready

duke

lord

me
if
you
have
not
lost
it
the
ball
that
which
contained
the
the
duke
took
it
from
under
his
pillow
and
gave
it
to
grimaud
grimaud
gave
a
grim
smile
well
asked
the
duke
well
my
lord
i
sew
up
the
paper
in
the
ball

some
one
at
hand

a
gardener
grimaud
nodded
the
same
as
yesterday
another
nod
on
the
part
of
grimaud
the
count
de
rochefort
grimaud
nodded
the
third
time
come
now
said
the
duke
give
some
particulars
of
the
plan
for
our
that
is
forbidden
me
said
grimaud
until
the
last
who
will
be
waiting
for
me
beyond
the
ditch
i
know
nothing
about
it
my
but
at
least
if
you
don
t
want
to
see
me
turn
crazy
tell
what
that
famous
pate
will
two
poniards
a
knotted
rope
and
a
poire
d
this
poire
d
angoisse
was
a
famous
gag
in
the
form
of
a
pear
being
thrust
into
the
mouth
by
the
aid
of
a
spring
dilated
as
to
distend
the
jaws
to
their
greatest
yes
i
my
lord
observes
that
there
will
be
enough
to
go
we
shall
take
to
ourselves
the
poniards
and
the
rope
replied
the
duke
and
make
la
ramee
eat
the
pear
answered
grimaud
my
dear
grimaud
thou
speakest
seldom
but
when
thou
dost
one
must
do
thee
justice
thy
words
are
words
of
one
of
marie
michon
s
adventures
whilst
these
projects
were
being
formed
by
the
duc
de
beaufort
and
grimaud
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
were
entering
paris
by
the
rue
du
faubourg
saint
marcel
they
stopped
at
the
sign
of
the
fox
in
the
rue
du
vieux
colombier
a
tavern
known
for
many
years
by
athos
and
asked
for
two
bedrooms
you
must
dress
yourself
raoul
said
athos
i
am
going
to
present
you
to
some
monsieur
asked
the
young
man
in
half
an
the
young
man
bowed
perhaps
not
being
endowed
with
the
endurance
of
athos
who
seemed
to
be
made
of
iron
he
would
have
preferred
a
bath
in
the
river
seine
of
which
he
had
heard
so
much
and
afterward
his
bed
but
the
comte
de
la
fere
had
spoken
and
he
had
no
thought
but
to
obey
by
the
way
said
athos
take
some
pains
with
your
toilet
raoul
i
want
you
to
be
i
hope
sir
replied
the
youth
smiling
that
there
s
no
idea
of
a
marriage
for
me
you
know
of
my
engagement
to
louise
athos
in
his
turn
smiled
also
no
don
t
be
alarmed
although
it
is
to
a
lady
that
i
am
going
to
present
you
and
i
am
anxious
that
you
should
love
her
the
young
man
looked
at
the
count
with
a
certain
uneasiness
but
at
a
smile
from
athos
he
was
quickly
reassured
how
old
is
she
inquired
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
my
dear
raoul
learn
once
for
all
that
that
is
a
question
which
is
never
asked
when
you
can
find
out
a
woman
s
age
by
her
face
it
is
useless
to
ask
it
when
you
can
not
do
so
it
is
is
she
beautiful
sixteen
years
ago
she
was
deemed
not
only
the
prettiest
but
the
most
graceful
woman
in
this
reply
reassured
the
vicomte
a
woman
who
had
been
a
reigning
beauty
a
year
before
he
was
born
could
not
be
the
subject
of
any
scheme
for
him
he
retired
to
his
toilet
when
he
reappeared
athos
received
him
with
the
same
paternal
smile
as
that
which
he
had
often
bestowed
on
d
artagnan
but
a
more
profound
tenderness
for
raoul
was
now
visibly
impressed
upon
his
face
athos
cast
a
glance
at
his
feet
hands
and
hair
those
three
marks
of
race
the
youth
s
dark
hair
was
neatly
parted
and
hung
in
curls
forming
a
sort
of
dark
frame
around
his
face
such
was
the
fashion
of
the
day
gloves
of
gray
kid
matching
the
hat
well
displayed
the
form
of
a
slender
and
elegant
hand
whilst
his
boots
similar
in
color
to
the
hat
and
gloves
confined
feet
small
as
those
of
a
boy
twelve
years
old
come
murmured
athos
if
she
is
not
proud
of
him
she
must
be
hard
to
it
was
three
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
two
travelers
proceeded
to
the
rue
saint
dominique
and
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
magnificent
hotel
surmounted
with
the
arms
of
de
luynes
tis
here
said
athos
he
entered
the
hotel
and
ascended
the
front
steps
and
addressing
a
footman
who
waited
there
in
a
grand
livery
asked
if
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
was
visible
and
if
she
could
receive
the
comte
de
la
fere
the
servant
returned
with
a
message
to
say
that
though
the
duchess
had
not
the
honor
of
knowing
monsieur
de
la
fere
she
would
receive
him
athos
followed
the
footman
who
led
him
through
a
long
succession
of
apartments
and
paused
at
length
before
a
closed
door
athos
made
a
sign
to
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
to
remain
where
he
was
the
footman
opened
the
door
and
announced
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
madame
de
chevreuse
whose
name
appears
so
often
in
our
story
the
three
musketeers
without
her
actually
having
appeared
in
any
scene
was
still
a
beautiful
woman
although
about
or
years
old
she
might
have
passed
for
she
still
had
her
rich
fair
hair
her
large
animated
intelligent
eyes
so
often
opened
by
intrigue
so
often
closed
by
the
blindness
of
love
she
had
still
her
form
so
that
when
her
back
was
turned
she
still
was
not
unlike
the
girl
who
had
jumped
with
anne
of
austria
over
the
moat
of
the
tuileries
in
in
all
other
respects
she
was
the
same
mad
creature
who
threw
over
her
amours
such
an
air
of
originality
as
to
make
them
proverbial
for
eccentricity
in
her
family
she
was
in
a
little
boudoir
hung
with
blue
damask
adorned
by
red
flowers
with
a
foliage
of
gold
looking
upon
a
garden
and
reclined
upon
a
sofa
her
head
supported
on
the
rich
tapestry
which
covered
it
she
held
a
book
in
her
hand
and
her
arm
was
supported
by
a
cushion
at
the
footman
s
announcement
she
raised
herself
a
little
and
peeped
out
with
some
curiosity
athos
appeared
he
was
dressed
in
velvet
trimmed
with
silk
of
the
same
color
his
were
of
burnished
silver
his
mantle
had
no
gold
nor
embroidery
on
it
a
simple
plume
of
violet
feathers
adorned
his
hat
his
boots
were
of
black
leather
and
at
his
girdle
hung
that
sword
with
a
magnificent
hilt
that
porthos
had
so
often
admired
in
the
rue
feron
splendid
lace
adorned
the
falling
collar
of
his
shirt
and
lace
fell
also
over
the
top
of
his
boots
in
his
whole
person
he
bore
such
an
impress
of
high
degree
that
madame
de
chevreuse
half
rose
from
her
seat
when
she
saw
him
and
made
him
a
sign
to
sit
down
near
her
athos
bowed
and
obeyed
the
footman
was
withdrawing
but
athos
stopped
him
by
a
sign
madame
he
said
to
the
duchess
i
have
had
the
boldness
to
present
myself
at
your
hotel
without
being
known
to
you
it
has
succeeded
since
you
deign
to
receive
me
i
have
now
the
boldness
to
ask
you
for
an
interview
of
half
an
i
grant
it
monsieur
replied
madame
de
chevreuse
with
her
most
gracious
smile
but
that
is
not
all
madame
oh
i
am
very
presuming
i
am
aware
the
interview
for
which
i
ask
is
of
us
two
alone
and
i
very
earnestly
wish
that
it
may
not
be
i
am
not
at
home
to
any
one
said
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
to
the
footman
you
may
the
footman
went
out
there
ensued
a
brief
silence
during
which
these
two
persons
who
at
first
sight
recognized
each
other
so
clearly
as
of
noble
race
examined
each
other
without
embarrassment
on
either
side
the
duchess
was
the
first
to
speak
well
sir
i
am
waiting
with
impatience
to
hear
what
you
wish
to
say
to
and
i
madame
replied
athos
am
looking
with
sir
said
madame
de
chevreuse
you
must
excuse
me
but
i
long
to
know
to
whom
i
am
talking
you
belong
to
the
court
doubtless
yet
i
have
never
seen
you
at
court
have
you
by
any
chance
been
in
the
bastile
no
madame
i
have
not
but
very
likely
i
am
on
the
road
to
ah
then
tell
me
who
you
are
and
get
along
with
you
upon
your
journey
replied
the
duchess
with
the
gayety
which
made
her
so
charming
for
i
am
sufficiently
in
bad
odor
already
without
compromising
myself
still
who
i
am
madame
my
name
has
been
mentioned
to
you
the
comte
de
la
fere
you
do
not
know
that
name
i
once
bore
another
which
you
knew
but
you
have
certainly
forgotten
tell
it
me
formerly
said
the
count
i
was
madame
de
chevreuse
looked
astonished
the
name
was
not
wholly
forgotten
but
mixed
up
and
confused
with
ancient
recollections
athos
said
she
wait
a
and
she
placed
her
hands
on
her
brow
as
if
to
force
the
fugitive
ideas
it
contained
to
concentration
in
a
moment
shall
i
help
you
madame
asked
athos
yes
do
said
the
duchess
this
athos
was
connected
with
three
young
musketeers
named
porthos
d
artagnan
and
he
stopped
short
and
aramis
said
the
duchess
quickly
and
aramis
i
see
you
have
not
forgotten
the
no
she
said
poor
aramis
a
charming
man
elegant
discreet
and
a
writer
of
poetical
verses
i
am
afraid
he
has
turned
out
ill
she
added
he
has
he
is
an
ah
what
a
misfortune
exclaimed
the
duchess
playing
carelessly
with
her
fan
indeed
sir
i
thank
you
you
have
recalled
one
of
the
most
agreeable
recollections
of
my
will
you
permit
me
then
to
recall
another
to
you
relating
to
him
yes
and
faith
said
madame
de
chevreuse
say
on
with
a
man
like
you
i
fear
athos
bowed
aramis
he
continued
was
intimate
with
a
young
needlewoman
from
tours
a
cousin
of
his
named
marie
ah
i
knew
her
cried
the
duchess
it
was
to
her
he
wrote
from
the
siege
of
rochelle
to
warn
her
of
a
plot
against
the
duke
of
exactly
so
will
you
allow
me
to
speak
to
you
of
her
if
replied
the
duchess
with
a
meaning
look
you
do
not
say
too
much
against
i
should
be
ungrateful
said
athos
and
i
regard
ingratitude
not
as
a
fault
or
a
crime
but
as
a
vice
which
is
much
you
ungrateful
to
marie
michon
monsieur
said
madame
de
chevreuse
trying
to
read
in
athos
s
eyes
but
how
can
that
be
you
never
knew
eh
madame
who
knows
said
athos
there
is
a
popular
proverb
to
the
effect
that
it
is
only
mountains
that
never
meet
and
popular
proverbs
contain
sometimes
a
wonderful
amount
of
oh
go
on
monsieur
go
on
said
madame
de
chevreuse
eagerly
you
can
t
imagine
how
much
this
conversation
interests
you
encourage
me
said
athos
i
will
continue
then
that
cousin
of
aramis
that
marie
michon
that
needlewoman
notwithstanding
her
low
condition
had
acquaintances
in
the
highest
rank
she
called
the
grandest
ladies
of
the
court
her
friend
and
the
queen
proud
as
she
is
in
her
double
character
as
austrian
and
as
spaniard
called
her
her
alas
said
madame
de
chevreuse
with
a
slight
sigh
and
a
little
movement
of
her
eyebrows
that
was
peculiarly
her
own
since
that
time
everything
has
and
the
queen
had
reason
for
her
affection
for
marie
was
devoted
to
her
devoted
to
that
degree
that
she
served
her
as
medium
of
intercourse
with
her
brother
the
king
of
which
interrupted
the
duchess
is
now
brought
up
against
her
as
a
great
and
therefore
continued
athos
the
cardinal
the
true
cardinal
the
other
one
determined
one
fine
morning
to
arrest
poor
marie
michon
and
send
her
to
the
chateau
de
loches
fortunately
the
affair
was
not
managed
so
secretly
but
that
it
became
known
to
the
queen
the
case
had
been
provided
for
if
marie
michon
should
be
threatened
with
any
danger
the
queen
was
to
send
her
a
bound
in
green
that
is
true
monsieur
you
are
well
one
morning
the
green
book
was
brought
to
her
by
the
prince
de
marsillac
there
was
no
time
to
lose
happily
marie
and
a
follower
of
hers
named
kitty
could
disguise
themselves
admirably
in
men
s
clothes
the
prince
procured
for
marie
michon
the
dress
of
a
cavalier
and
for
kitty
that
of
a
lackey
he
sent
them
two
excellent
horses
and
the
fugitives
went
out
hastily
from
tours
shaping
their
course
toward
spain
trembling
at
the
least
noise
following
unfrequented
roads
and
asking
for
hospitality
when
they
found
themselves
where
there
was
no
why
really
it
was
all
exactly
as
you
say
cried
madame
de
chevreuse
clapping
her
hands
it
would
indeed
be
strange
if
she
checked
herself
if
i
should
follow
the
two
fugitives
to
the
end
of
their
journey
said
athos
no
madame
i
will
not
thus
waste
your
time
we
will
accompany
them
only
to
a
little
village
in
limousin
lying
between
tulle
and
angouleme
a
little
village
called
madame
de
chevreuse
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
looked
at
athos
with
an
expression
of
astonishment
that
made
the
old
musketeer
smile
wait
madame
continued
athos
what
remains
for
me
to
tell
you
is
even
more
strange
than
what
i
have
monsieur
said
madame
de
chevreuse
i
believe
you
are
a
sorcerer
i
am
prepared
for
anything
but
really
no
matter
go
the
journey
of
that
day
had
been
long
and
wearing
it
was
a
cold
day
the
eleventh
of
october
there
was
no
inn
or
chateau
in
the
village
and
the
homes
of
the
peasants
were
poor
and
unattractive
marie
michon
was
a
very
aristocratic
person
like
her
sister
the
queen
she
had
been
accustomed
to
pleasing
perfumes
and
fine
linen
she
resolved
therefore
to
seek
hospitality
of
the
athos
paused
oh
continue
said
the
duchess
i
have
told
you
that
i
am
prepared
for
the
two
travelers
knocked
at
the
door
it
was
late
the
priest
who
had
gone
to
bed
cried
out
to
them
to
come
in
they
entered
for
the
door
was
not
locked
there
is
much
confidence
among
villagers
a
lamp
burned
in
the
chamber
occupied
by
the
priest
marie
michon
who
made
the
most
charming
cavalier
in
the
world
pushed
open
the
door
put
her
head
in
and
asked
for
hospitality
willingly
my
young
cavalier
said
the
priest
if
you
will
be
content
with
the
remains
of
my
supper
and
with
half
my
the
two
travelers
consulted
for
a
moment
the
priest
heard
a
burst
of
laughter
and
then
the
master
or
rather
the
mistress
replied
thank
you
monsieur
le
cure
i
sup
then
and
make
as
little
noise
as
possible
said
the
priest
for
i
too
have
been
on
the
go
all
day
and
shall
not
be
sorry
to
sleep
madame
de
chevreuse
evidently
went
from
surprise
to
astonishment
and
from
astonishment
to
stupefaction
her
face
as
she
looked
at
athos
had
taken
on
an
expression
that
can
not
be
described
it
could
be
seen
that
she
had
wished
to
speak
but
she
had
remained
silent
through
fear
of
losing
one
of
her
companion
s
words
what
happened
then
she
asked
then
said
athos
ah
i
have
come
now
to
what
is
most
speak
speak
one
can
say
anything
to
me
besides
it
doesn
t
concern
me
it
relates
to
mademoiselle
marie
ah
that
is
true
said
athos
well
then
marie
michon
had
supper
with
her
follower
and
then
in
accordance
with
the
permission
given
her
she
entered
the
chamber
of
her
host
kitty
meanwhile
taking
possession
of
an
armchair
in
the
room
first
entered
where
they
had
taken
their
really
monsieur
said
madame
de
chevreuse
unless
you
are
the
devil
in
person
i
don
t
know
how
you
could
become
acquainted
with
all
these
a
charming
woman
was
that
marie
michon
resumed
athos
one
of
those
wild
creatures
who
are
constantly
conceiving
the
strangest
ideas
now
thinking
that
her
host
was
a
priest
that
coquette
took
it
into
her
head
that
it
would
be
a
happy
souvenir
for
her
old
age
among
the
many
happy
souvenirs
she
already
possessed
if
she
could
win
that
of
having
damned
an
count
said
the
duchess
upon
my
word
you
frighten
alas
continued
athos
the
poor
abbe
was
not
a
ambroise
and
i
repeat
marie
michon
was
an
adorable
monsieur
cried
the
duchess
seizing
athos
s
hands
tell
me
this
moment
how
you
know
all
these
details
or
i
will
send
to
the
convent
of
the
vieux
augustins
for
a
monk
to
come
and
exorcise
athos
laughed
nothing
is
easier
madame
a
cavalier
charged
with
an
important
mission
had
come
an
hour
before
your
arrival
seeking
hospitality
at
the
very
moment
that
the
cure
summoned
to
the
bedside
of
a
dying
person
left
not
only
his
house
but
the
village
for
the
entire
night
the
priest
having
all
confidence
in
his
guest
who
besides
was
a
nobleman
had
left
to
him
his
house
his
supper
and
his
chamber
and
therefore
marie
came
seeking
hospitality
from
the
guest
of
the
good
abbe
and
not
from
the
good
abbe
and
that
cavalier
that
guest
that
nobleman
who
arrived
before
she
came
it
was
i
the
comte
de
la
fere
said
athos
rising
and
bowing
respectfully
to
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
the
duchess
remained
a
moment
stupefied
then
suddenly
bursting
into
laughter
ah
upon
my
word
said
she
it
is
very
droll
and
that
mad
marie
michon
fared
better
than
she
expected
sit
down
dear
count
and
go
on
with
your
at
this
point
i
have
to
accuse
myself
of
a
fault
madame
i
have
told
you
that
i
was
traveling
on
an
important
mission
at
daybreak
i
left
the
chamber
without
noise
leaving
my
charming
companion
asleep
in
the
front
room
the
follower
was
also
still
asleep
her
head
leaning
back
on
the
chair
in
all
respects
worthy
of
her
mistress
her
pretty
face
arrested
my
attention
i
approached
and
recognized
that
little
kitty
whom
our
friend
aramis
had
placed
with
her
in
that
way
i
discovered
that
the
charming
traveler
was
marie
michon
said
madame
de
chevreuse
hastily
marie
michon
continued
athos
then
i
went
out
of
the
house
i
proceeded
to
the
stable
and
found
my
horse
saddled
and
my
lackey
ready
we
set
forth
on
our
and
have
you
never
revisited
that
village
eagerly
asked
madame
de
chevreuse
a
year
after
well
i
wanted
to
see
the
good
cure
again
i
found
him
much
preoccupied
with
an
event
that
he
could
not
at
all
comprehend
a
week
before
he
had
received
in
a
cradle
a
beautiful
little
boy
three
months
old
with
a
purse
filled
with
gold
and
a
note
containing
these
simple
words
october
it
was
the
date
of
that
strange
adventure
interrupted
madame
de
chevreuse
yes
but
he
couldn
t
understand
what
it
meant
for
he
had
spent
that
night
with
a
dying
person
and
marie
michon
had
left
his
house
before
his
you
must
know
monsieur
that
marie
michon
when
she
returned
to
france
in
immediately
sought
for
information
about
that
child
as
a
fugitive
she
could
not
take
care
of
it
but
on
her
return
she
wished
to
have
it
near
and
what
said
the
abbe
asked
athos
that
a
nobleman
whom
he
did
not
know
had
wished
to
take
charge
of
it
had
answered
for
its
future
and
had
taken
it
that
was
ah
i
see
that
nobleman
was
you
it
was
his
father
hush
do
not
speak
so
loud
madame
he
is
he
is
there
my
son
the
son
of
marie
michon
but
i
must
see
him
take
care
madame
said
athos
for
he
knows
neither
his
father
nor
his
you
have
kept
the
secret
you
have
brought
him
to
see
me
thinking
to
make
me
happy
oh
thanks
sir
thanks
cried
madame
de
chevreuse
seizing
his
hand
and
trying
to
put
it
to
her
lips
you
have
a
noble
i
bring
him
to
you
madame
said
athos
withdrawing
his
hand
hoping
that
in
your
turn
you
will
do
something
for
him
till
now
i
have
watched
over
his
education
and
i
have
made
him
i
hope
an
accomplished
gentleman
but
i
am
now
obliged
to
return
to
the
dangerous
and
wandering
life
of
party
faction
i
plunge
into
an
adventurous
affair
in
which
i
may
be
killed
then
it
will
devolve
on
you
to
push
him
on
in
that
world
where
he
is
called
on
to
occupy
a
rest
assured
cried
the
duchess
i
shall
do
what
i
can
i
have
but
little
influence
now
but
all
that
i
have
shall
most
assuredly
be
his
as
to
his
title
and
fortune
as
to
that
madame
i
have
made
over
to
him
the
estate
of
bragelonne
my
inheritance
which
will
give
him
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
and
the
title
of
upon
my
soul
monsieur
said
the
duchess
you
are
a
true
nobleman
but
i
am
eager
to
see
our
young
vicomte
where
is
he
there
in
the
salon
i
will
have
him
come
in
if
you
really
wish
athos
moved
toward
the
door
the
duchess
held
him
back
is
he
handsome
she
asked
athos
smiled
he
resembles
his
so
he
opened
the
door
and
beckoned
the
young
man
in
the
duchess
could
not
restrain
a
cry
of
joy
on
seeing
so
handsome
a
young
cavalier
so
far
surpassing
all
that
her
maternal
pride
had
been
able
to
conceive
vicomte
come
here
said
athos
the
duchess
permits
you
to
kiss
her
the
youth
approached
with
his
charming
smile
and
his
head
bare
and
kneeling
down
kissed
the
hand
of
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
sir
he
said
turning
to
athos
was
it
not
in
compassion
to
my
timidity
that
you
told
me
that
this
lady
was
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
and
is
she
not
the
queen
no
vicomte
said
madame
de
chevreuse
taking
his
hand
and
making
him
sit
near
her
while
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
no
unhappily
i
am
not
the
queen
if
i
were
i
should
do
for
you
at
once
the
most
that
you
deserve
but
let
us
see
whatever
i
may
be
she
added
hardly
restraining
herself
from
kissing
that
pure
brow
let
us
see
what
profession
you
wish
to
athos
standing
looked
at
them
both
with
indescribable
pleasure
madame
answered
the
youth
in
his
sweet
voice
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
only
one
career
for
a
gentleman
that
of
the
army
i
have
been
brought
up
by
monsieur
le
comte
with
the
intention
i
believe
of
making
me
a
soldier
and
he
gave
me
reason
to
hope
that
at
paris
he
would
present
me
to
some
one
who
would
recommend
me
to
the
favor
of
the
yes
i
understand
it
well
personally
i
am
on
bad
terms
with
him
on
account
of
the
quarrels
between
madame
de
montbazon
my
and
madame
de
longueville
but
the
prince
de
marsillac
yes
indeed
that
s
the
right
thing
the
prince
de
marsillac
my
old
friend
will
recommend
our
young
friend
to
madame
de
longueville
who
will
give
him
a
letter
to
her
brother
the
prince
who
loves
her
too
tenderly
not
to
do
what
she
wishes
well
that
will
do
charmingly
said
the
count
but
may
i
beg
that
the
greatest
haste
may
be
made
for
i
have
reasons
for
wishing
the
vicomte
not
to
sleep
longer
than
night
in
paris
do
you
wish
it
known
that
you
are
interested
about
him
monsieur
le
comte
better
for
him
in
future
that
he
should
be
supposed
never
to
have
seen
oh
sir
cried
raoul
you
know
bragelonne
said
athos
i
never
speak
without
well
comte
i
am
going
instantly
interrupted
the
duchess
to
send
for
the
prince
de
marsillac
who
is
happily
in
paris
just
now
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
evening
we
intend
to
visit
the
abbe
scarron
for
whom
i
have
a
letter
of
introduction
and
at
whose
house
i
expect
to
meet
some
of
my
tis
well
i
will
go
there
also
for
a
few
minutes
said
the
duchess
do
not
quit
his
salon
until
you
have
seen
athos
bowed
and
prepared
to
leave
well
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
duchess
smiling
does
one
leave
so
solemnly
his
old
friends
ah
murmured
athos
kissing
her
hand
had
i
only
sooner
known
that
marie
michon
was
so
charming
a
creature
and
he
withdrew
sighing
the
abbe
scarron
there
was
once
in
the
rue
des
tournelles
a
house
known
by
all
the
sedan
chairmen
and
footmen
of
paris
and
yet
nevertheless
this
house
was
neither
that
of
a
great
lord
nor
of
a
rich
man
there
was
neither
dining
nor
playing
at
cards
nor
dancing
in
that
house
nevertheless
it
was
the
rendezvous
of
the
great
world
and
all
paris
went
there
it
was
the
abode
of
the
little
abbe
scarron
in
the
home
of
the
witty
abbe
dwelt
incessant
laughter
there
all
the
items
of
the
day
had
their
source
and
were
so
quickly
transformed
misrepresented
metamorphosed
some
into
epigrams
some
into
falsehoods
that
every
one
was
anxious
to
pass
an
hour
with
little
scarron
listening
to
what
he
said
reporting
it
to
others
the
diminutive
abbe
scarron
who
however
was
an
abbe
only
because
he
owned
an
abbey
and
not
because
he
was
in
orders
had
formerly
been
one
of
the
gayest
prebendaries
in
the
town
of
mans
which
he
inhabited
on
a
day
of
the
carnival
he
had
taken
a
notion
to
provide
an
unusual
entertainment
for
that
good
town
of
which
he
was
the
life
and
soul
he
had
made
his
valet
cover
him
with
honey
then
opening
a
feather
bed
he
had
rolled
in
it
and
had
thus
become
the
most
grotesque
fowl
it
is
possible
to
imagine
he
then
began
to
visit
his
friends
of
both
sexes
in
that
strange
costume
at
first
he
had
been
followed
through
astonishment
then
with
derisive
shouts
then
the
porters
had
insulted
him
then
children
had
thrown
stones
at
him
and
finally
he
was
obliged
to
run
to
escape
the
missiles
as
soon
as
he
took
to
flight
every
one
pursued
him
until
pressed
on
all
sides
scarron
found
no
way
of
escaping
his
escort
except
by
throwing
himself
into
the
river
but
the
water
was
icy
cold
scarron
was
heated
the
cold
seized
on
him
and
when
he
reached
the
farther
bank
he
found
himself
crippled
every
means
had
been
employed
in
vain
to
restore
the
use
of
his
limbs
he
had
been
subjected
to
a
severe
disciplinary
course
of
medicine
at
length
he
sent
away
all
his
doctors
declaring
that
he
preferred
the
disease
to
the
treatment
and
came
to
paris
where
the
fame
of
his
wit
had
preceded
him
there
he
had
a
chair
made
on
his
own
plan
and
one
day
visiting
anne
of
austria
in
this
chair
she
asked
him
charmed
as
she
was
with
his
wit
if
he
did
not
wish
for
a
title
yes
your
majesty
there
is
a
title
which
i
covet
much
replied
scarron
and
what
is
that
that
of
being
your
invalid
answered
scarron
so
he
was
called
the
queen
s
invalid
with
a
pension
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
from
that
lucky
moment
scarron
led
a
happy
life
spending
both
income
and
principal
one
day
however
an
emissary
of
the
cardinal
s
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
was
wrong
in
receiving
the
coadjutor
so
often
and
why
asked
scarron
is
he
not
a
man
of
good
birth
agreeable
witty
he
has
unfortunately
too
much
well
then
why
do
you
wish
me
to
give
up
seeing
such
a
man
because
he
is
an
of
whom
of
the
what
answered
scarron
i
continue
to
receive
monsieur
gilles
despreaux
who
thinks
ill
of
me
and
you
wish
me
to
give
up
seeing
the
coadjutor
because
he
thinks
ill
of
another
man
impossible
the
conversation
had
rested
there
and
scarron
through
sheer
obstinacy
had
seen
monsieur
de
gondy
only
the
more
frequently
now
the
very
morning
of
which
we
speak
was
that
of
his
payment
and
scarron
as
usual
had
sent
his
servant
to
get
his
money
at
the
but
the
man
had
returned
and
said
that
the
government
had
no
more
money
to
give
monsieur
scarron
it
was
on
thursday
the
abbe
s
reception
day
people
went
there
in
crowds
the
cardinal
s
refusal
to
pay
the
pension
was
known
about
the
town
in
half
an
hour
and
he
was
abused
with
wit
and
vehemence
in
the
rue
saint
honore
athos
fell
in
with
two
gentlemen
whom
he
did
not
know
on
horseback
like
himself
followed
by
a
lackey
like
himself
and
going
in
the
same
direction
that
he
was
one
of
them
hat
in
hand
said
to
him
would
you
believe
it
monsieur
that
contemptible
mazarin
has
stopped
poor
scarron
s
that
is
unreasonable
said
athos
saluting
in
his
turn
the
two
cavaliers
and
they
separated
with
courteous
gestures
it
happens
well
that
we
are
going
there
this
evening
said
athos
to
the
vicomte
we
will
pay
our
compliments
to
that
poor
what
then
is
this
monsieur
scarron
who
thus
puts
all
paris
in
commotion
is
he
some
minister
out
of
office
oh
no
not
at
all
vicomte
athos
replied
he
is
simply
a
gentleman
of
great
genius
who
has
fallen
into
disgrace
with
the
cardinal
through
having
written
certain
verses
against
do
gentlemen
then
make
verses
asked
raoul
naively
i
thought
it
was
so
it
is
my
dear
vicomte
said
athos
laughing
to
make
bad
ones
but
to
make
good
ones
increases
fame
witness
monsieur
de
rotrou
nevertheless
he
continued
in
the
tone
of
one
who
gives
wholesome
advice
i
think
it
is
better
not
to
make
then
said
raoul
this
monsieur
scarron
is
a
poet
yes
you
are
warned
vicomte
consider
well
what
you
do
in
that
house
talk
only
by
gestures
or
rather
always
yes
monsieur
replied
raoul
you
will
see
me
talking
with
one
of
my
friends
the
abbe
d
herblay
of
whom
you
have
often
heard
me
i
remember
him
come
near
to
us
from
time
to
time
as
if
to
speak
but
do
not
speak
and
do
not
listen
that
little
stratagem
may
serve
to
keep
off
very
well
monsieur
i
will
obey
you
at
all
athos
made
two
visits
in
paris
at
seven
o
clock
he
and
raoul
directed
their
steps
to
the
rue
des
tournelles
it
was
stopped
by
porters
horses
and
footmen
athos
forced
his
way
through
and
entered
followed
by
the
young
man
the
first
person
that
struck
him
on
his
entrance
was
aramis
planted
near
a
great
chair
on
castors
very
large
covered
with
a
canopy
of
tapestry
under
which
there
moved
enveloped
in
a
quilt
of
brocade
a
little
face
youngish
very
merry
somewhat
pallid
whilst
its
eyes
never
ceased
to
express
a
sentiment
at
once
lively
intellectual
and
amiable
this
was
the
abbe
scarron
always
laughing
joking
complimenting
yet
suffering
and
toying
nervously
with
a
small
switch
around
this
kind
of
rolling
tent
pressed
a
crowd
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
the
room
was
neatly
comfortably
furnished
large
valances
of
silk
embroidered
with
flowers
of
gay
colors
which
were
rather
faded
fell
from
the
wide
windows
the
fittings
of
the
room
were
simple
but
in
excellent
taste
two
well
trained
servingmen
were
in
attendance
on
the
company
on
perceiving
athos
aramis
advanced
toward
him
took
him
by
the
hand
and
presented
him
to
scarron
raoul
remained
silent
for
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
dignity
of
the
bel
esprit
after
some
minutes
the
door
opened
and
a
footman
announced
mademoiselle
paulet
athos
touched
the
shoulder
of
the
vicomte
look
at
this
lady
raoul
she
is
an
historic
personage
it
was
to
visit
her
king
henry
iv
was
going
when
he
was
every
one
thronged
around
mademoiselle
paulet
for
she
was
always
very
much
the
fashion
she
was
a
tall
woman
with
a
slender
figure
and
a
forest
of
golden
curls
such
as
raphael
was
fond
of
and
titian
has
painted
all
his
magdalens
with
this
hair
or
perhaps
the
sort
of
ascendancy
which
she
had
over
other
women
gave
her
the
name
of
la
mademoiselle
paulet
took
her
accustomed
seat
but
before
sitting
down
she
cast
in
all
her
grandeur
a
look
around
the
room
and
her
eyes
rested
on
raoul
athos
smiled
mademoiselle
paulet
has
observed
you
vicomte
go
and
bow
to
her
don
t
try
to
appear
anything
but
what
you
are
a
true
country
youth
on
no
account
speak
to
her
of
henry
when
shall
we
two
walk
together
athos
then
said
to
aramis
presently
there
are
not
a
sufficient
number
of
people
here
yet
we
shall
be
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
in
walked
the
coadjutor
at
this
name
every
one
looked
around
for
his
was
already
a
very
celebrated
name
athos
did
the
same
he
knew
the
abbe
de
gondy
only
by
report
he
saw
a
little
dark
man
ill
made
and
awkward
with
his
hands
in
everything
except
drawing
a
sword
and
firing
a
pistol
with
something
haughty
and
contemptuous
in
his
face
scarron
turned
around
toward
him
and
came
to
meet
him
in
his
chair
well
said
the
coadjutor
on
seeing
him
you
are
in
disgrace
then
abbe
this
was
the
orthodox
phrase
it
had
been
said
that
evening
a
hundred
times
and
scarron
was
at
his
hundredth
bon
mot
on
the
subject
he
was
very
nearly
at
the
end
of
his
humoristic
tether
but
one
despairing
effort
saved
him
monsieur
the
cardinal
mazarin
has
been
so
kind
as
to
think
of
me
he
said
but
how
can
you
continue
to
receive
us
asked
the
coadjutor
if
your
income
is
lessened
i
shall
be
obliged
to
make
you
a
canon
of
notre
oh
no
cried
scarron
i
should
compromise
you
too
perhaps
you
have
resources
of
which
we
are
ignorant
i
shall
borrow
from
the
but
her
majesty
has
no
property
interposed
aramis
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
madame
de
chevreuse
was
announced
every
one
arose
scarron
turned
his
chair
toward
the
door
raoul
blushed
athos
made
a
sign
to
aramis
who
went
and
hid
himself
in
the
enclosure
of
a
window
in
the
midst
of
all
the
compliments
that
awaited
her
on
her
entrance
the
duchess
seemed
to
be
looking
for
some
one
at
last
she
found
out
raoul
and
her
eyes
sparkled
she
perceived
athos
and
became
thoughtful
she
saw
aramis
in
the
seclusion
of
the
window
and
gave
a
start
of
surprise
behind
her
fan
apropos
she
said
as
if
to
drive
away
thoughts
that
pursued
her
in
spite
of
herself
how
is
poor
voiture
do
you
know
scarron
what
is
monsieur
voiture
ill
inquired
a
gentleman
who
had
spoken
to
athos
in
the
rue
saint
honore
what
is
the
matter
with
him
he
was
acting
but
forgot
to
take
the
precaution
to
have
a
change
of
linen
ready
after
the
performance
said
the
coadjutor
so
he
took
cold
and
is
about
to
is
he
then
so
ill
dear
voiture
asked
aramis
half
hidden
by
the
window
curtain
die
cried
mademoiselle
paulet
bitterly
he
why
he
is
surrounded
by
sultanas
like
a
turk
madame
de
saintot
has
hastened
to
him
with
broth
la
renaudot
warms
his
sheets
the
marquise
de
rambouillet
sends
him
his
you
don
t
like
him
my
dear
parthenie
said
scarron
what
an
injustice
my
dear
invalid
i
hate
him
so
little
that
i
should
be
delighted
to
order
masses
for
the
repose
of
his
you
are
not
called
lionne
for
nothing
observed
madame
de
chevreuse
your
teeth
are
you
are
unjust
to
a
great
poet
it
seems
to
me
raoul
ventured
to
say
a
great
poet
come
one
may
easily
see
vicomte
that
you
are
lately
from
the
provinces
and
have
never
so
much
as
seen
him
a
great
poet
he
is
scarcely
five
feet
bravo
bravo
cried
a
tall
man
with
an
enormous
mustache
and
a
long
rapier
bravo
fair
paulet
it
is
high
time
to
put
little
voiture
in
his
right
place
for
my
part
i
always
thought
his
poetry
detestable
and
i
think
i
know
something
about
who
is
this
officer
inquired
raoul
of
athos
who
is
speaking
monsieur
de
scudery
the
author
of
clelie
and
of
le
grand
cyrus
which
were
composed
partly
by
him
and
partly
by
his
sister
who
is
now
talking
to
that
pretty
person
yonder
near
monsieur
raoul
turned
and
saw
two
faces
just
arrived
one
was
perfectly
charming
delicate
pensive
shaded
by
beautiful
dark
hair
and
eyes
soft
as
velvet
like
those
lovely
flowers
the
heartsease
in
which
shine
out
the
golden
petals
the
other
of
mature
age
seemed
to
have
the
former
one
under
her
charge
and
was
cold
dry
and
yellow
the
true
type
of
a
duenna
or
a
devotee
raoul
resolved
not
to
quit
the
room
without
having
spoken
to
the
beautiful
girl
with
the
soft
eyes
who
by
a
strange
fancy
although
she
bore
no
resemblance
reminded
him
of
his
poor
little
louise
whom
he
had
left
in
the
chateau
de
la
valliere
and
whom
in
the
midst
of
all
the
party
he
had
never
for
one
moment
quite
forgotten
meantime
aramis
had
drawn
near
to
the
coadjutor
who
smiling
all
the
while
contrived
to
drop
some
words
into
his
ear
aramis
notwithstanding
his
could
not
refrain
from
a
slight
movement
of
surprise
laugh
then
said
monsieur
de
retz
they
are
looking
at
and
leaving
aramis
he
went
to
talk
with
madame
de
chevreuse
who
was
in
the
midst
of
a
large
group
aramis
affected
a
laugh
to
divert
the
attention
of
certain
curious
listeners
and
perceiving
that
athos
had
betaken
himself
to
the
embrasure
of
a
window
and
remained
there
he
proceeded
to
join
him
throwing
out
a
few
words
carelessly
as
he
moved
through
the
room
as
soon
as
the
two
friends
met
they
began
a
conversation
which
was
emphasized
by
frequent
gesticulation
raoul
then
approached
them
as
athos
had
directed
him
to
do
tis
a
rondeau
by
monsieur
voiture
that
monsieur
l
abbe
is
repeating
to
said
athos
in
a
loud
voice
and
i
confess
i
think
it
raoul
stayed
only
a
few
minutes
near
them
and
then
mingled
with
the
group
round
madame
de
chevreuse
well
then
asked
athos
in
a
low
tone
it
is
to
be
said
aramis
hastily
at
what
time
six
o
where
at
saint
who
told
you
the
count
de
some
one
drew
near
and
then
philosophic
ideas
are
wholly
wanting
in
voiture
s
works
but
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
as
the
coadjutor
he
is
a
poet
a
true
aramis
spoke
so
as
to
be
heard
by
everybody
and
i
too
murmured
the
young
lady
with
the
velvet
eyes
i
have
the
misfortune
also
to
admire
his
poetry
monsieur
scarron
do
me
the
honor
said
raoul
blushing
to
tell
me
the
name
of
that
young
lady
whose
opinion
seems
so
different
from
that
of
others
of
the
ah
my
young
vicomte
replied
scarron
i
suppose
you
wish
to
propose
to
her
an
alliance
offensive
and
raoul
blushed
again
you
asked
the
name
of
that
young
lady
she
is
called
the
fair
excuse
me
sir
returned
raoul
blushing
still
more
deeply
i
know
no
more
than
i
did
before
alas
i
am
from
the
which
means
that
you
know
very
little
about
the
nonsense
which
here
flows
down
our
streets
so
much
the
better
young
man
so
much
the
better
don
t
try
to
understand
it
you
will
only
lose
your
you
forgive
me
then
sir
said
raoul
and
you
will
deign
to
tell
me
who
is
the
person
that
you
call
the
young
indian
certainly
one
of
the
most
charming
persons
that
lives
mademoiselle
frances
d
does
she
belong
to
the
family
of
the
celebrated
agrippa
the
friend
of
henry
iv
his
granddaughter
she
comes
from
martinique
so
i
call
her
the
beautiful
raoul
looked
surprised
and
his
eyes
met
those
of
the
young
lady
who
smiled
the
company
went
on
speaking
of
the
poet
voiture
monsieur
said
mademoiselle
d
aubigne
to
scarron
as
if
she
wished
to
join
in
the
conversation
he
was
engaged
in
with
raoul
do
you
not
admire
monsieur
voiture
s
friends
listen
how
they
pull
him
to
pieces
even
whilst
they
praise
him
one
takes
away
from
him
all
claim
to
good
sense
another
robs
him
of
his
poetry
a
third
of
his
originality
another
of
his
humor
another
of
his
independence
of
character
a
sixth
but
good
heavens
what
will
they
leave
him
as
mademoiselle
de
scudery
scarron
and
raoul
laughed
the
fair
indian
astonished
at
the
sensation
her
observation
produced
looked
down
and
resumed
her
air
of
naivete
athos
still
within
the
inclosure
of
the
window
watched
this
scene
with
a
smile
of
disdain
on
his
lips
tell
the
comte
de
la
fere
to
come
to
me
said
madame
de
chevreuse
i
want
to
speak
to
and
i
said
the
coadjutor
want
it
to
be
thought
that
i
do
not
speak
to
him
i
admire
i
love
him
for
i
know
his
former
adventures
but
i
shall
not
speak
to
him
until
the
day
after
and
why
day
after
asked
madame
de
chevreuse
you
will
know
that
evening
said
the
coadjutor
smiling
really
my
dear
gondy
said
the
duchess
you
remind
one
of
the
apocalypse
monsieur
d
herblay
she
added
turning
toward
aramis
will
you
be
my
servant
once
more
this
evening
how
can
you
doubt
it
replied
aramis
this
evening
always
command
i
will
then
go
and
look
for
the
comte
de
la
fere
i
wish
to
speak
with
aramis
found
athos
and
brought
him
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
duchess
giving
him
a
letter
here
is
what
i
promised
you
our
young
friend
will
be
extremely
well
madame
he
is
very
happy
in
owing
any
obligation
to
you
have
no
reason
to
envy
him
on
that
score
for
i
owe
to
you
the
pleasure
of
knowing
him
replied
the
witty
woman
with
a
smile
which
recalled
marie
michon
to
aramis
and
to
athos
as
she
uttered
that
bon
mot
she
arose
and
asked
for
her
carriage
mademoiselle
paulet
had
already
gone
mademoiselle
de
scudery
was
going
vicomte
said
athos
to
raoul
follow
the
duchess
beg
her
to
do
you
the
favor
to
take
your
arm
in
going
downstairs
and
thank
her
as
you
the
fair
indian
approached
scarron
you
are
going
already
he
said
one
of
the
last
as
you
see
if
you
hear
anything
of
monsieur
voiture
be
so
kind
as
to
send
me
word
oh
said
scarron
he
may
die
why
asked
the
young
girl
with
the
velvet
eyes
certainly
his
panegyric
has
been
they
parted
laughing
she
turning
back
to
gaze
at
the
poor
paralytic
man
with
interest
he
looking
after
her
with
eyes
of
love
one
by
one
the
several
groups
broke
up
scarron
seemed
not
to
observe
that
certain
of
his
guests
had
talked
mysteriously
that
letters
had
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
that
the
assembly
had
seemed
to
have
a
secret
purpose
quite
apart
from
the
literary
discussion
carried
on
with
so
much
ostentation
what
was
all
that
to
scarron
at
his
house
rebellion
could
be
planned
with
impunity
for
as
we
have
said
since
that
morning
he
had
ceased
to
be
the
queen
s
as
to
raoul
he
had
attended
the
duchess
to
her
carriage
where
as
she
took
her
seat
she
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
then
by
one
of
those
wild
caprices
which
made
her
so
adorable
and
at
the
same
time
so
dangerous
she
had
suddenly
put
her
arm
around
his
neck
and
kissed
his
forehead
saying
vicomte
may
my
good
wishes
and
this
kiss
bring
you
good
fortune
then
she
had
pushed
him
away
and
directed
the
coachman
to
stop
at
the
hotel
de
luynes
the
carriage
had
started
madame
de
chevreuse
had
made
a
parting
gesture
to
the
young
man
and
raoul
had
returned
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
athos
surmised
what
had
taken
place
and
smiled
come
vicomte
he
said
it
is
time
for
you
to
go
to
bed
you
will
start
in
the
morning
for
the
army
of
monsieur
le
prince
sleep
well
your
last
night
as
i
am
to
be
a
soldier
then
said
the
young
man
oh
monsieur
i
thank
you
with
all
my
adieu
count
said
the
abbe
d
herblay
i
return
to
my
adieu
abbe
said
the
coadjutor
i
am
to
preach
and
have
twenty
texts
to
examine
this
adieu
gentlemen
said
the
count
i
am
going
to
sleep
hours
i
am
just
falling
down
with
the
three
men
saluted
one
another
whilst
exchanging
a
last
look
scarron
followed
their
movements
with
a
glance
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
not
one
of
them
will
do
as
he
says
he
murmured
with
his
little
monkey
smile
but
they
may
do
as
they
please
the
brave
gentlemen
who
knows
if
they
will
not
manage
to
restore
to
me
my
pension
they
can
move
their
arms
they
can
and
that
is
much
alas
i
have
only
my
tongue
but
i
will
try
to
show
that
it
is
good
for
something
ho
there
champenois
here
it
is
eleven
o
clock
come
and
roll
me
to
bed
really
that
demoiselle
d
aubigne
is
very
charming
so
the
invalid
disappeared
soon
afterward
and
went
into
his
and
one
by
one
the
lights
in
the
salon
of
the
rue
des
tournelles
were
extinguished
saint
denis
the
day
had
begun
to
break
when
athos
arose
and
dressed
himself
it
was
plain
by
a
paleness
still
greater
than
usual
and
by
those
traces
which
loss
of
sleep
leaves
on
the
face
that
he
must
have
passed
almost
the
whole
of
the
night
without
sleeping
contrary
to
the
custom
of
a
man
so
firm
and
decided
there
was
this
morning
in
his
personal
appearance
something
tardy
and
irresolute
he
was
occupied
with
the
preparations
for
raoul
s
departure
and
was
seeking
to
gain
time
in
the
first
place
he
himself
furbished
a
sword
which
he
drew
from
its
perfumed
leather
sheath
he
examined
it
to
see
if
its
hilt
was
well
guarded
and
if
the
blade
was
firmly
attached
to
the
hilt
then
he
placed
at
the
bottom
of
the
valise
belonging
to
the
young
man
a
small
bag
of
louis
called
olivain
the
lackey
who
had
followed
him
from
blois
and
made
him
pack
the
valise
under
his
own
eyes
watchful
to
see
that
everything
should
be
put
in
which
might
be
useful
to
a
young
man
entering
on
his
first
campaign
at
length
after
occupying
about
an
hour
in
these
preparations
he
opened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
vicomte
slept
and
entered
the
sun
already
high
penetrated
into
the
room
through
the
window
the
curtains
of
which
raoul
had
neglected
to
close
on
the
previous
evening
he
was
still
sleeping
his
head
gracefully
reposing
on
his
arm
athos
approached
and
hung
over
the
youth
in
an
attitude
full
of
tender
melancholy
he
looked
long
on
this
young
man
whose
smiling
mouth
and
half
closed
eyes
bespoke
soft
dreams
and
lightest
slumber
as
if
his
guardian
angel
watched
over
him
with
solicitude
and
affection
by
degrees
athos
gave
himself
up
to
the
charms
of
his
reverie
in
the
proximity
of
youth
so
pure
so
fresh
his
own
youth
seemed
to
reappear
bringing
with
it
all
those
savoury
remembrances
which
are
like
perfumes
more
than
thoughts
between
the
past
and
the
present
was
an
ineffable
abyss
but
imagination
has
the
wings
of
an
angel
of
light
and
travels
safely
through
or
over
the
seas
where
we
have
been
almost
shipwrecked
the
darkness
in
which
our
illusions
are
lost
the
precipice
whence
our
happiness
has
been
hurled
and
swallowed
up
he
remembered
that
all
the
first
part
of
his
life
had
been
embittered
by
a
woman
and
he
thought
with
alarm
of
the
influence
love
might
assume
over
so
fine
and
at
the
same
time
so
vigorous
an
organization
as
that
of
raoul
in
recalling
all
he
had
been
through
he
foresaw
all
that
raoul
might
suffer
and
the
expression
of
the
deep
and
tender
compassion
which
throbbed
in
his
heart
was
pictured
in
the
moist
eye
with
which
he
gazed
on
the
young
man
at
this
moment
raoul
awoke
without
a
cloud
on
his
face
without
weariness
or
lassitude
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
those
of
athos
and
perhaps
he
comprehended
all
that
passed
in
the
heart
of
the
man
who
was
awaiting
his
awakening
as
a
lover
awaits
the
awakening
of
his
mistress
for
his
glance
in
return
had
all
the
tenderness
of
love
you
are
there
sir
he
said
respectfully
yes
raoul
replied
the
count
and
you
did
not
awaken
me
i
wished
to
leave
you
still
to
enjoy
some
moments
of
sleep
my
child
you
must
be
fatigued
from
oh
sir
how
good
you
are
athos
smiled
how
do
you
feel
this
morning
he
inquired
perfectly
well
quite
rested
you
are
still
growing
athos
continued
with
that
charming
and
paternal
interest
felt
by
a
grown
man
for
a
youth
oh
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
exclaimed
raoul
ashamed
of
so
much
attention
in
an
instant
i
shall
be
athos
then
called
olivain
everything
said
olivain
to
athos
has
been
done
according
to
your
directions
the
horses
are
and
i
was
asleep
cried
raoul
whilst
you
sir
you
had
the
kindness
to
attend
to
all
these
details
truly
sir
you
overwhelm
me
with
benefits
therefore
you
love
me
a
little
i
hope
replied
athos
in
a
tone
of
emotion
oh
sir
god
knows
how
much
i
love
revere
see
that
you
forget
nothing
said
athos
appearing
to
look
about
him
that
he
might
hide
his
emotion
no
indeed
sir
answered
raoul
the
servant
then
approached
athos
and
said
hesitatingly
monsieur
le
vicomte
has
no
tis
well
said
athos
i
will
take
care
of
they
went
downstairs
raoul
looking
every
now
and
then
at
the
count
to
see
if
the
moment
of
farewell
was
at
hand
but
athos
was
silent
when
they
reached
the
steps
raoul
saw
three
horses
oh
sir
then
you
are
going
with
me
i
will
accompany
you
a
portion
of
the
way
said
athos
joy
shone
in
raoul
s
eyes
and
he
leaped
lightly
to
his
saddle
athos
mounted
more
slowly
after
speaking
in
a
low
voice
to
the
lackey
who
instead
of
following
them
immediately
returned
to
their
rooms
raoul
delighted
at
the
count
s
companionship
perceived
or
affected
to
perceive
nothing
of
this
byplay
they
set
out
passing
over
the
pont
neuf
they
pursued
their
way
along
the
quay
then
called
l
abreuvoir
pepin
and
went
along
by
the
walls
of
the
grand
chatelet
they
proceeded
to
the
rue
saint
denis
after
passing
through
the
porte
saint
denis
athos
looked
at
raoul
s
way
of
riding
and
observed
take
care
raoul
i
have
already
often
told
you
of
this
you
must
not
forget
it
for
it
is
a
great
defect
in
a
rider
see
your
horse
is
tired
already
he
froths
at
the
mouth
whilst
mine
looks
as
if
he
had
only
just
left
the
stable
you
hold
the
bit
too
tight
and
so
make
his
mouth
hard
so
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
him
manoeuvre
quickly
the
safety
of
a
cavalier
often
depends
on
the
prompt
obedience
of
his
horse
in
a
week
remember
you
will
no
longer
be
performing
your
manoeuvres
for
practice
but
on
a
field
of
then
suddenly
in
order
not
to
give
too
uncomfortable
an
importance
to
this
observation
see
raoul
he
resumed
what
a
fine
plain
for
partridge
the
young
man
stored
in
his
mind
the
admonition
whilst
he
admired
the
delicate
tenderness
with
which
it
was
bestowed
i
have
remarked
also
another
thing
said
athos
which
is
that
in
firing
off
your
pistol
you
hold
your
arm
too
far
outstretched
this
tension
lessens
the
accuracy
of
the
aim
so
in
twelve
times
you
thrice
missed
the
which
you
sir
struck
twelve
times
answered
raoul
smiling
because
i
bent
my
arm
and
rested
my
hand
on
my
elbow
so
do
you
understand
what
i
mean
yes
sir
i
have
fired
since
in
that
manner
and
have
been
quite
what
a
cold
wind
resumed
athos
a
wintry
blast
apropos
if
you
fire
and
you
will
do
so
for
you
are
recommended
to
a
young
general
who
is
very
fond
of
powder
remember
that
in
single
combat
which
often
takes
place
in
the
cavalry
never
to
fire
the
first
shot
he
who
fires
the
first
shot
rarely
hits
his
man
for
he
fires
with
the
apprehension
of
being
disarmed
before
an
armed
foe
then
whilst
he
fires
make
your
horse
rear
that
manoeuvre
has
saved
my
life
several
i
shall
do
so
if
only
in
gratitude
eh
cried
athos
are
not
those
fellows
poachers
they
have
arrested
yonder
they
are
then
another
important
thing
raoul
should
you
be
wounded
in
a
battle
and
fall
from
your
horse
if
you
have
any
strength
left
disentangle
yourself
from
the
line
that
your
regiment
has
formed
otherwise
it
may
be
driven
back
and
you
will
be
trampled
to
death
by
the
horses
at
all
events
should
you
be
wounded
write
to
me
that
very
instant
or
get
some
one
at
once
to
write
to
me
we
are
judges
of
wounds
we
old
soldiers
athos
added
smiling
thank
you
sir
answered
the
young
man
much
moved
they
arrived
that
very
moment
at
the
gate
of
the
town
guarded
by
two
sentinels
here
comes
a
young
gentleman
said
one
of
them
who
seems
as
if
he
were
going
to
join
the
how
do
you
make
that
out
inquired
athos
by
his
manner
sir
and
his
age
he
s
the
second
has
a
young
man
such
as
i
am
gone
through
this
morning
then
asked
raoul
faith
yes
with
a
haughty
presence
a
fine
equipage
such
as
the
son
of
a
noble
house
would
he
will
be
my
companion
on
the
journey
sir
cried
raoul
alas
he
can
not
make
me
forget
what
i
shall
have
lost
thus
talking
they
traversed
the
streets
full
of
people
on
account
of
the
fete
and
arrived
opposite
the
old
cathedral
where
first
mass
was
going
on
let
us
alight
raoul
said
athos
olivain
take
care
of
our
horses
and
give
me
my
the
two
gentlemen
then
went
into
the
church
athos
gave
raoul
some
of
the
holy
water
a
love
as
tender
as
that
of
a
lover
for
his
mistress
dwells
undoubtedly
in
some
paternal
hearts
toward
a
son
athos
said
a
word
to
one
of
the
vergers
who
bowed
and
proceeded
toward
the
basement
come
raoul
he
said
let
us
follow
this
the
verger
opened
the
iron
grating
that
guarded
the
royal
tombs
and
stood
on
the
topmost
step
whilst
athos
and
raoul
descended
the
sepulchral
depths
of
the
descent
were
dimly
lighted
by
a
silver
lamp
on
the
lowest
step
and
just
below
this
lamp
there
was
laid
wrapped
in
a
flowing
mantle
of
violet
velvet
worked
with
of
gold
a
catafalque
resting
on
trestles
of
oak
the
young
man
prepared
for
this
scene
by
the
state
of
his
own
feelings
which
were
mournful
and
by
the
majesty
of
the
cathedral
which
he
had
passed
through
descended
in
a
slow
and
solemn
manner
and
stood
with
head
uncovered
before
these
mortal
spoils
of
the
last
king
who
was
not
to
be
placed
by
the
side
of
his
forefathers
until
his
successor
should
take
his
place
there
and
who
appeared
to
abide
on
that
spot
that
he
might
thus
address
human
pride
so
sure
to
be
exalted
by
the
glories
of
a
throne
dust
of
the
earth
here
i
await
thee
there
was
profound
silence
then
athos
raised
his
hand
and
pointing
to
the
coffin
this
temporary
sepulture
is
he
said
that
of
a
man
who
was
of
feeble
mind
yet
one
whose
reign
was
full
of
great
events
because
over
this
king
watched
the
spirit
of
another
man
even
as
this
lamp
keeps
vigil
over
this
coffin
and
illumines
it
he
whose
intellect
was
thus
supreme
raoul
was
the
actual
sovereign
the
other
nothing
but
a
phantom
to
whom
he
lent
a
soul
and
yet
so
powerful
is
majesty
amongst
us
this
man
has
not
even
the
honor
of
a
tomb
at
the
feet
of
him
in
whose
service
his
life
was
worn
away
remember
raoul
this
if
richelieu
made
the
king
by
comparison
seem
small
he
made
royalty
great
the
palace
of
the
louvre
contains
two
things
the
king
who
must
die
and
royalty
which
never
dies
the
minister
so
feared
so
hated
by
his
master
has
descended
into
the
tomb
drawing
after
him
the
king
whom
he
would
not
leave
alone
on
earth
lest
his
work
should
be
destroyed
so
blind
were
his
contemporaries
that
they
regarded
the
cardinal
s
death
as
a
deliverance
and
i
even
i
opposed
the
designs
of
the
great
man
who
held
the
destinies
of
france
within
the
hollow
of
his
hand
raoul
learn
how
to
distinguish
the
king
from
royalty
the
king
is
but
a
man
royalty
is
the
gift
of
god
whenever
you
hesitate
as
to
whom
you
ought
to
serve
abandon
the
exterior
the
material
appearance
for
the
invisible
principle
for
the
invisible
principle
is
everything
raoul
i
seem
to
read
your
future
destiny
as
through
a
cloud
it
will
be
happier
i
think
than
ours
has
been
different
in
your
fate
from
us
you
will
have
a
king
without
a
minister
whom
you
may
serve
love
respect
should
the
king
prove
a
tyrant
for
power
begets
tyranny
serve
love
respect
royalty
that
divine
right
that
celestial
spark
which
makes
this
dust
still
powerful
and
holy
so
that
we
gentlemen
nevertheless
of
rank
and
condition
are
as
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
cold
corpse
there
i
shall
adore
god
sir
said
raoul
respect
royalty
and
ever
serve
the
king
and
if
death
be
my
lot
i
hope
to
die
for
the
king
for
royalty
and
for
god
have
i
sir
comprehended
your
instructions
athos
smiled
yours
is
a
noble
he
said
here
is
your
raoul
bent
his
knee
to
the
ground
it
was
worn
by
my
father
a
loyal
gentleman
i
have
worn
it
in
my
turn
and
it
has
sometimes
not
been
disgraced
when
the
hilt
was
in
my
hand
and
the
sheath
at
my
side
should
your
hand
still
be
too
weak
to
use
this
sword
raoul
so
much
the
better
you
will
have
the
more
time
to
learn
to
draw
it
only
when
it
ought
to
be
sir
replied
raoul
putting
the
sword
to
his
lips
as
he
received
it
from
the
count
i
owe
you
everything
and
yet
this
sword
is
the
most
precious
gift
you
have
yet
made
me
i
will
wear
it
i
swear
to
you
as
a
grateful
man
should
tis
well
arise
vicomte
embrace
raoul
arose
and
threw
himself
with
emotion
into
the
count
s
arms
adieu
faltered
the
count
who
felt
his
heart
die
away
within
him
adieu
and
think
of
oh
for
ever
and
ever
cried
the
youth
oh
i
swear
to
you
sir
should
any
harm
befall
me
your
name
will
be
the
last
name
that
i
shall
utter
the
remembrance
of
you
my
last
athos
hastened
upstairs
to
conceal
his
emotion
and
regained
with
hurried
steps
the
porch
where
olivain
was
waiting
with
the
horses
olivain
said
athos
showing
the
servant
raoul
s
tighten
the
buckle
of
the
sword
it
falls
too
low
you
will
accompany
monsieur
le
vicomte
till
grimaud
rejoins
you
you
know
raoul
grimaud
is
an
old
and
zealous
servant
he
will
follow
yes
sir
answered
raoul
now
to
horse
that
i
may
see
you
depart
raoul
obeyed
adieu
raoul
said
the
count
adieu
my
dearest
boy
adieu
sir
adieu
my
beloved
athos
waved
his
hand
he
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
and
raoul
went
away
his
head
uncovered
athos
remained
motionless
looking
after
him
until
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
street
then
the
count
threw
the
bridle
of
his
horse
into
the
hands
of
a
peasant
remounted
the
steps
went
into
the
cathedral
there
to
kneel
down
in
the
darkest
corner
and
pray
one
of
the
forty
methods
of
escape
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
meanwhile
time
was
passing
on
for
the
prisoner
as
well
as
for
those
who
were
preparing
his
escape
only
for
him
it
passed
more
slowly
unlike
other
men
who
enter
with
ardor
upon
a
perilous
resolution
and
grow
cold
as
the
moment
of
execution
approaches
the
duc
de
beaufort
whose
buoyant
courage
had
become
a
proverb
seemed
to
push
time
before
him
and
sought
most
eagerly
to
hasten
the
hour
of
action
in
his
escape
alone
apart
from
his
plans
for
the
future
which
it
must
be
admitted
were
for
the
present
sufficiently
vague
and
uncertain
there
was
a
beginning
of
vengeance
which
filled
his
heart
in
the
first
place
his
escape
would
be
a
serious
misfortune
to
monsieur
de
chavigny
whom
he
hated
for
the
petty
persecutions
he
owed
to
him
it
would
be
a
still
worse
affair
for
mazarin
whom
he
execrated
for
the
greater
offences
he
had
committed
it
may
be
observed
that
there
was
a
proper
proportion
in
his
sentiments
toward
the
governor
of
the
prison
and
the
minister
toward
the
subordinate
and
the
master
then
monsieur
de
beaufort
who
was
so
familiar
with
the
interior
of
the
palais
royal
though
he
did
not
know
the
relations
existing
between
the
queen
and
the
cardinal
pictured
to
himself
in
his
prison
all
that
dramatic
excitement
which
would
ensue
when
the
rumor
should
run
from
the
minister
s
cabinet
to
the
chamber
of
anne
of
austria
monsieur
de
beaufort
has
escaped
whilst
saying
that
to
himself
monsieur
de
beaufort
smiled
pleasantly
and
imagined
himself
already
outside
breathing
the
air
of
the
plains
and
the
forests
pressing
a
strong
horse
between
his
knees
and
crying
out
in
a
loud
voice
i
am
free
it
is
true
that
on
coming
to
himself
he
found
that
he
was
still
within
four
walls
he
saw
la
ramee
twirling
his
thumbs
ten
feet
from
him
and
his
guards
laughing
and
drinking
in
the
the
only
thing
that
was
pleasant
to
him
in
that
odious
tableau
such
is
the
instability
of
the
human
mind
was
the
sullen
face
of
grimaud
for
whom
he
had
at
first
conceived
such
a
hatred
and
who
now
was
all
his
hope
grimaud
seemed
to
him
an
antinous
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
transformation
was
visible
only
to
the
prisoner
s
feverish
imagination
grimaud
was
still
the
same
and
therefore
he
retained
the
entire
confidence
of
his
superior
la
ramee
who
now
relied
upon
him
more
than
he
did
upon
himself
for
as
we
have
said
la
ramee
felt
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
a
certain
weakness
for
monsieur
de
beaufort
and
so
the
good
la
ramee
made
a
festivity
of
the
little
supper
with
his
prisoner
he
had
but
one
fault
he
was
a
gourmand
he
had
found
the
pates
good
the
wine
excellent
now
the
successor
of
pere
marteau
had
promised
him
a
pate
of
pheasant
instead
of
a
pate
of
fowl
and
chambertin
wine
instead
of
macon
all
this
set
off
by
the
presence
of
that
excellent
prince
who
was
so
who
invented
so
droll
tricks
against
monsieur
de
chavigny
and
so
fine
jokes
against
mazarin
made
for
la
ramee
the
approaching
pentecost
one
of
the
four
great
feasts
of
the
year
he
therefore
looked
forward
to
six
o
clock
with
as
much
impatience
as
the
duke
himself
since
daybreak
la
ramee
had
been
occupied
with
the
preparations
and
trusting
no
one
but
himself
he
had
visited
personally
the
successor
of
pere
marteau
the
latter
had
surpassed
himself
he
showed
la
ramee
a
monstrous
pate
ornamented
with
monsieur
de
beaufort
s
it
was
empty
as
yet
but
a
pheasant
and
two
partridges
were
lying
near
it
la
ramee
s
mouth
watered
and
he
returned
to
the
duke
s
chamber
rubbing
his
hands
to
crown
his
happiness
monsieur
de
chavigny
had
started
on
a
journey
that
morning
and
in
his
absence
la
ramee
was
of
the
chateau
as
for
grimaud
he
seemed
more
sullen
than
ever
in
the
course
of
the
forenoon
monsieur
de
beaufort
had
a
game
of
tennis
with
la
ramee
a
sign
from
grimaud
put
him
on
the
alert
grimaud
going
in
advance
followed
the
course
which
they
were
to
take
in
the
evening
the
game
was
played
in
an
inclosure
called
the
little
court
of
the
chateau
a
place
quite
deserted
except
when
monsieur
de
beaufort
was
playing
and
even
then
the
precaution
seemed
superfluous
the
wall
was
so
high
there
were
three
gates
to
open
before
reaching
the
inclosure
each
by
a
different
key
when
they
arrived
grimaud
went
carelessly
and
sat
down
by
a
loophole
in
the
wall
letting
his
legs
dangle
outside
it
was
evident
that
there
the
rope
ladder
was
to
be
attached
this
manoeuvre
transparent
to
the
duc
de
beaufort
was
quite
unintelligible
to
la
ramee
the
game
at
tennis
which
upon
a
sign
from
grimaud
monsieur
de
beaufort
had
consented
to
play
began
in
the
afternoon
the
duke
was
in
full
strength
and
beat
la
ramee
completely
four
of
the
guards
who
were
constantly
near
the
prisoner
assisted
in
picking
up
the
tennis
balls
when
the
game
was
over
the
duke
laughing
at
la
ramee
for
his
bad
play
offered
these
men
two
louis
d
or
to
go
and
drink
his
health
with
their
four
other
comrades
the
guards
asked
permission
of
la
ramee
who
gave
it
to
them
but
not
till
the
evening
however
until
then
he
had
business
and
the
prisoner
was
not
to
be
left
alone
six
o
clock
came
and
although
they
were
not
to
sit
down
to
table
until
seven
o
clock
dinner
was
ready
and
served
up
upon
a
sideboard
appeared
the
colossal
pie
with
the
duke
s
arms
on
it
and
seemingly
cooked
to
a
turn
as
far
as
one
could
judge
by
the
golden
color
which
illuminated
the
crust
the
rest
of
the
dinner
was
to
come
every
one
was
impatient
la
ramee
to
sit
down
to
table
the
guards
to
go
and
drink
the
duke
to
escape
grimaud
alone
was
calm
as
ever
one
might
have
fancied
that
athos
had
educated
him
with
the
express
forethought
of
such
a
great
event
there
were
moments
when
looking
at
grimaud
the
duke
asked
himself
if
he
was
not
dreaming
and
if
that
marble
figure
was
really
at
his
service
and
would
grow
animated
when
the
moment
came
for
action
la
ramee
sent
away
the
guards
desiring
them
to
drink
to
the
duke
s
health
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
shut
all
the
doors
put
the
keys
in
his
pocket
and
showed
the
table
to
the
prince
with
an
air
that
signified
whenever
my
lord
the
prince
looked
at
grimaud
grimaud
looked
at
the
clock
it
was
hardly
a
six
the
escape
was
fixed
to
take
place
at
seven
o
clock
there
was
therefore
of
an
hour
to
wait
the
duke
in
order
to
pass
away
another
quarter
of
an
hour
pretended
to
be
reading
something
that
interested
him
and
muttered
that
he
wished
they
would
allow
him
to
finish
his
chapter
la
ramee
went
up
to
him
and
looked
over
his
shoulder
to
see
what
sort
of
a
book
it
was
that
had
so
singular
an
influence
over
the
prisoner
as
to
make
him
put
off
taking
his
dinner
it
was
caesar
s
commentaries
which
la
ramee
had
lent
him
contrary
to
the
orders
of
the
governor
and
la
ramee
resolved
never
again
to
disobey
these
injunctions
meantime
he
uncorked
the
bottles
and
went
to
smell
if
the
pie
was
good
at
six
the
duke
arose
and
said
very
gravely
certainly
caesar
was
the
greatest
man
of
ancient
you
think
so
my
lord
answered
la
ramee
well
as
for
me
i
prefer
and
why
pray
master
la
ramee
asked
the
duke
because
he
left
no
commentaries
replied
la
ramee
with
his
coarse
laugh
the
duke
vouchsafed
no
reply
but
sitting
down
at
the
table
made
a
sign
that
la
ramee
should
seat
himself
opposite
there
is
nothing
so
expressive
as
the
face
of
an
epicure
who
finds
himself
before
a
well
spread
table
so
la
ramee
when
receiving
his
plate
of
soup
from
grimaud
presented
a
type
of
perfect
bliss
the
duke
smiled
zounds
he
said
i
don
t
suppose
there
is
a
more
contented
man
at
this
moment
in
all
the
kingdom
than
yourself
you
are
right
my
lord
duke
answered
the
officer
i
don
t
know
any
pleasanter
sight
on
earth
than
a
well
covered
table
and
when
added
to
that
he
who
does
the
honors
is
the
grandson
of
henry
you
will
my
lord
duke
easily
comprehend
that
the
honor
fairly
doubles
the
pleasure
one
the
duke
in
his
turn
bowed
and
an
imperceptible
smile
appeared
on
the
face
of
grimaud
who
kept
behind
la
ramee
my
dear
la
ramee
said
the
duke
you
are
the
only
man
to
turn
such
faultless
no
my
lord
duke
replied
la
ramee
in
the
fullness
of
his
heart
i
say
what
i
think
there
is
no
compliment
in
what
i
say
to
you
then
you
are
attached
to
me
asked
the
duke
to
own
the
truth
i
should
be
inconsolable
if
you
were
to
leave
a
droll
way
of
showing
your
the
duke
meant
to
say
but
my
lord
returned
la
ramee
what
would
you
do
if
you
got
out
every
folly
you
committed
would
embroil
you
with
the
court
and
they
would
put
you
into
the
bastile
instead
of
vincennes
now
monsieur
de
chavigny
is
not
amiable
i
allow
but
monsieur
du
tremblay
is
considerably
indeed
exclaimed
the
duke
who
from
time
to
time
looked
at
the
clock
the
fingers
of
which
seemed
to
move
with
sickening
slowness
but
what
can
you
expect
from
the
brother
of
a
capuchin
monk
brought
up
in
the
school
of
cardinal
richelieu
ah
my
lord
it
is
a
great
happiness
that
the
queen
who
always
wished
you
well
had
a
fancy
to
send
you
here
where
there
s
a
promenade
and
a
tennis
court
good
air
and
a
good
in
short
answered
the
duke
if
i
comprehend
you
aright
la
ramee
i
am
ungrateful
for
having
ever
thought
of
leaving
this
place
oh
my
lord
duke
tis
the
height
of
ingratitude
but
your
highness
has
never
seriously
thought
of
it
yes
returned
the
duke
i
must
confess
i
sometimes
think
of
still
by
one
of
your
forty
methods
your
highness
yes
yes
my
lord
said
la
ramee
now
we
are
quite
at
our
ease
and
enjoying
ourselves
pray
tell
me
one
of
those
forty
ways
invented
by
your
willingly
answered
the
duke
give
me
the
pie
i
am
listening
said
la
ramee
leaning
back
in
his
armchair
and
raising
his
glass
of
madeira
to
his
lips
and
winking
his
eye
that
he
might
see
the
sun
through
the
rich
liquid
that
he
was
about
to
taste
the
duke
glanced
at
the
clock
in
ten
minutes
it
would
strike
seven
grimaud
placed
the
pie
before
the
duke
who
took
a
knife
with
a
silver
blade
to
raise
the
upper
crust
but
la
ramee
who
was
afraid
of
any
harm
happening
to
this
fine
work
of
art
passed
his
knife
which
had
an
iron
blade
to
the
duke
thank
you
la
ramee
said
the
prisoner
well
my
lord
this
famous
invention
of
yours
must
i
tell
you
replied
the
duke
on
what
i
most
reckon
and
what
i
determine
to
try
first
yes
that
s
the
thing
my
lord
cried
his
custodian
gaily
well
i
should
hope
in
the
first
instance
to
have
for
keeper
an
honest
fellow
like
and
you
have
me
my
lord
well
having
then
a
keeper
like
la
ramee
i
should
try
also
to
have
introduced
to
him
by
some
friend
or
other
a
man
who
would
be
devoted
to
me
who
would
assist
me
in
my
come
come
said
la
ramee
that
s
not
a
bad
capital
isn
t
it
for
instance
the
former
servingman
of
some
brave
gentleman
an
enemy
himself
to
mazarin
as
every
gentleman
ought
to
hush
don
t
let
us
talk
politics
my
then
my
keeper
would
begin
to
trust
this
man
and
to
depend
upon
him
and
i
should
have
news
from
those
without
the
prison
ah
yes
but
how
can
the
news
be
brought
to
you
nothing
easier
in
a
game
of
tennis
for
in
a
game
of
tennis
asked
la
ramee
giving
more
serious
attention
to
the
duke
s
words
yes
see
i
send
a
ball
into
the
moat
a
man
is
there
who
picks
it
up
the
ball
contains
a
letter
instead
of
returning
the
ball
to
me
when
i
call
for
it
from
the
top
of
the
wall
he
throws
me
another
that
other
ball
contains
a
letter
thus
we
have
exchanged
ideas
and
no
one
has
seen
us
do
the
devil
it
does
the
devil
it
does
said
la
ramee
scratching
his
head
you
are
in
the
wrong
to
tell
me
that
my
lord
i
shall
have
to
watch
the
men
who
pick
up
the
duke
smiled
but
resumed
la
ramee
that
is
only
a
way
of
and
that
is
a
great
deal
it
seems
to
but
not
pardon
me
for
instance
i
say
to
my
friends
be
on
a
certain
day
on
a
certain
hour
at
the
other
side
of
the
moat
with
two
well
what
then
la
ramee
began
to
be
uneasy
unless
the
horses
have
wings
to
mount
the
ramparts
and
come
and
fetch
that
s
not
needed
i
have
replied
the
duke
a
way
of
descending
from
the
what
a
rope
yes
but
answered
la
ramee
trying
to
laugh
a
ladder
of
ropes
can
t
be
sent
around
a
ball
like
a
no
but
it
may
be
sent
in
something
in
something
else
in
something
else
in
what
in
a
pate
for
in
a
pate
said
la
ramee
yes
let
us
suppose
one
thing
replied
the
duke
let
us
suppose
for
instance
that
my
maitre
d
hotel
noirmont
has
purchased
the
shop
of
pere
marteau
well
said
la
ramee
shuddering
well
la
ramee
who
is
a
gourmand
sees
his
pates
thinks
them
more
attractive
than
those
of
pere
marteau
and
proposes
to
me
that
i
shall
try
them
i
consent
on
condition
that
la
ramee
tries
them
with
me
that
we
may
be
more
at
our
ease
la
ramee
removes
the
guards
keeping
only
grimaud
to
wait
on
us
grimaud
is
the
man
whom
a
friend
has
sent
to
second
me
in
everything
the
moment
for
my
escape
is
fixed
seven
o
clock
well
at
a
few
minutes
to
seven
at
a
few
minutes
to
seven
cried
la
ramee
cold
sweat
upon
his
brow
at
a
few
minutes
to
seven
returned
the
duke
suiting
the
action
to
the
words
i
raise
the
crust
of
the
pie
i
find
in
it
two
poniards
a
ladder
of
rope
and
a
gag
i
point
one
of
the
poniards
at
la
ramee
s
breast
and
i
say
to
him
my
friend
i
am
sorry
for
it
but
if
thou
stirrest
if
thou
utterest
one
cry
thou
art
a
dead
man
the
duke
in
pronouncing
these
words
suited
as
we
have
said
the
action
to
the
words
he
was
standing
near
the
officer
and
he
directed
the
point
of
the
poniard
in
such
a
manner
close
to
la
ramee
s
heart
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
that
individual
as
to
his
determination
meanwhile
grimaud
still
mute
as
ever
drew
from
the
pie
the
other
poniard
the
rope
ladder
and
the
gag
la
ramee
followed
all
these
objects
with
his
eyes
his
alarm
every
moment
increasing
oh
my
lord
he
cried
with
an
expression
of
stupefaction
in
his
face
you
haven
t
the
heart
to
kill
me
no
not
if
thou
dost
not
oppose
my
but
my
lord
if
i
allow
you
to
escape
i
am
a
ruined
i
will
compensate
thee
for
the
loss
of
thy
you
are
determined
to
leave
the
chateau
by
heaven
and
earth
this
night
i
am
determined
to
be
and
if
i
defend
myself
or
call
or
cry
out
i
will
kill
thee
on
the
honor
of
a
at
this
moment
the
clock
struck
seven
o
clock
said
grimaud
who
had
not
spoken
a
word
la
ramee
made
one
movement
in
order
to
satisfy
his
conscience
the
duke
frowned
the
officer
felt
the
point
of
the
poniard
which
having
penetrated
through
his
clothes
was
close
to
his
heart
let
us
dispatch
said
the
duke
my
lord
one
last
what
speak
make
bind
my
arms
my
lord
why
bind
thee
that
i
may
not
be
considered
as
your
your
hands
asked
grimaud
not
before
me
behind
but
with
what
asked
the
duke
with
your
belt
my
lord
replied
la
ramee
the
duke
undid
his
belt
and
gave
it
to
grimaud
who
tied
la
ramee
in
such
a
way
as
to
satisfy
him
your
feet
too
said
grimaud
la
ramee
stretched
out
his
legs
grimaud
took
a
tore
it
into
strips
and
tied
la
ramee
s
feet
together
now
my
lord
said
the
poor
man
let
me
have
the
poire
d
angoisse
i
ask
for
it
without
it
i
should
be
tried
in
a
court
of
justice
because
i
did
not
raise
the
alarm
thrust
it
into
my
mouth
my
lord
thrust
it
grimaud
prepared
to
comply
with
this
request
when
the
officer
made
a
sign
as
if
he
had
something
to
say
speak
said
the
duke
now
my
lord
do
not
forget
if
any
harm
happens
to
me
on
your
account
that
i
have
a
wife
and
four
rest
assured
put
the
gag
in
in
a
second
la
ramee
was
gagged
and
laid
prostrate
two
or
three
chairs
were
thrown
down
as
if
there
had
been
a
struggle
grimaud
then
took
from
the
pocket
of
the
officer
all
the
keys
it
contained
and
first
opened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
they
were
then
shut
it
and
it
and
both
he
and
the
duke
proceeded
rapidly
down
the
gallery
which
led
to
the
little
inclosure
at
last
they
reached
the
tennis
court
it
was
completely
deserted
no
sentinels
no
one
at
any
of
the
windows
the
duke
ran
to
the
rampart
and
perceived
on
the
other
side
of
the
ditch
three
cavaliers
with
two
riding
horses
the
duke
exchanged
a
signal
with
them
it
was
indeed
for
him
that
they
were
there
grimaud
meantime
undid
the
means
of
escape
this
was
not
however
a
rope
ladder
but
a
ball
of
silk
cord
with
a
narrow
board
which
was
to
pass
between
the
legs
the
ball
to
unwind
itself
by
the
weight
of
the
person
who
sat
astride
upon
the
board
go
said
the
duke
first
my
lord
inquired
grimaud
certainly
if
i
am
caught
i
risk
nothing
but
being
taken
back
again
to
prison
if
they
catch
thee
thou
wilt
be
true
replied
grimaud
and
instantly
grimaud
sitting
upon
the
board
as
if
on
horseback
commenced
his
perilous
descent
the
duke
followed
him
with
his
eyes
with
involuntary
terror
he
had
gone
down
about
of
the
length
of
the
wall
when
the
cord
broke
grimaud
fell
precipitated
into
the
moat
the
duke
uttered
a
cry
but
grimaud
did
not
give
a
single
moan
he
must
have
been
dreadfully
hurt
for
he
did
not
stir
from
the
place
where
he
fell
immediately
one
of
the
men
who
were
waiting
slipped
down
into
the
moat
tied
under
grimaud
s
shoulders
the
end
of
a
cord
and
the
remaining
two
who
held
the
other
end
drew
grimaud
to
them
descend
my
lord
said
the
man
in
the
moat
there
are
only
fifteen
feet
more
from
the
top
down
here
and
the
grass
is
the
duke
had
already
begun
to
descend
his
task
was
the
more
difficult
as
there
was
no
board
to
support
him
he
was
obliged
to
let
himself
down
by
his
hands
and
from
a
height
of
fifty
feet
but
as
we
have
said
he
was
active
strong
and
full
of
presence
of
mind
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
cord
he
was
then
only
fifteen
feet
from
the
ground
as
the
gentlemen
below
had
told
him
he
let
go
the
rope
and
fell
upon
his
feet
without
receiving
any
injury
he
instantly
began
to
climb
up
the
slope
of
the
moat
on
the
top
of
which
he
met
de
rochefort
the
other
two
gentlemen
were
unknown
to
him
grimaud
in
a
swoon
was
tied
securely
to
a
horse
gentlemen
said
the
duke
i
will
thank
you
later
now
we
have
not
a
moment
to
lose
on
then
on
those
who
love
me
follow
me
and
he
jumped
on
his
horse
and
set
off
at
full
gallop
snuffing
the
fresh
air
in
his
triumph
and
shouting
out
with
an
expression
of
face
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
free
free
free
the
timely
arrival
of
d
artagnan
in
paris
at
blois
d
artagnan
received
the
money
paid
to
him
by
mazarin
for
any
future
service
he
might
render
the
cardinal
from
blois
to
paris
was
a
journey
of
four
days
for
ordinary
travelers
but
d
artagnan
arrived
on
the
third
day
at
the
barriere
saint
denis
in
turning
the
corner
of
the
rue
montmartre
in
order
to
reach
the
rue
tiquetonne
and
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
where
he
had
appointed
porthos
to
meet
him
he
saw
at
one
of
the
windows
of
the
hotel
that
friend
himself
dressed
in
a
waistcoat
embroidered
with
silver
and
gaping
till
he
showed
every
one
of
his
white
teeth
whilst
the
people
passing
by
admiringly
gazed
at
this
gentleman
so
handsome
and
so
rich
who
seemed
to
weary
of
his
riches
and
his
greatness
d
artagnan
and
planchet
had
hardly
turned
the
corner
when
porthos
recognized
them
eh
d
artagnan
he
cried
thank
god
you
have
come
eh
dear
friend
replied
d
artagnan
porthos
came
down
at
once
to
the
threshold
of
the
hotel
ah
my
dear
friend
he
cried
what
bad
stabling
for
my
horses
indeed
said
d
artagnan
i
am
most
unhappy
to
hear
it
on
account
of
those
fine
and
i
also
i
was
also
wretchedly
off
he
answered
moving
backward
and
forward
as
he
spoke
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
hostess
he
added
with
his
air
of
vulgar
who
is
very
agreeable
and
understands
a
joke
i
should
have
got
a
lodging
the
pretty
madeleine
who
had
approached
during
this
colloquy
stepped
back
and
turned
pale
as
death
on
hearing
porthos
s
words
for
she
thought
the
scene
with
the
swiss
was
about
to
be
repeated
but
to
her
great
surprise
d
artagnan
remained
perfectly
calm
and
instead
of
being
angry
he
laughed
and
said
to
porthos
yes
i
understand
the
air
of
la
rue
tiquetonne
is
not
like
that
of
pierrefonds
but
console
yourself
i
will
soon
conduct
you
to
one
much
when
will
you
do
that
immediately
i
ah
so
much
the
better
to
that
exclamation
of
porthos
s
succeeded
a
groaning
low
and
profound
which
seemed
to
come
from
behind
a
door
d
artagnan
who
had
just
dismounted
then
saw
outlined
against
the
wall
the
enormous
stomach
of
mousqueton
whose
mouth
emitted
sounds
of
distress
and
you
too
my
poor
monsieur
mouston
are
out
of
place
in
this
poor
hotel
are
you
not
asked
d
artagnan
in
that
rallying
tone
which
may
indicate
either
compassion
or
mockery
he
finds
the
cooking
detestable
replied
porthos
why
then
doesn
t
he
attend
to
it
himself
as
at
chantilly
ah
monsieur
i
have
not
here
as
i
had
there
the
ponds
of
monsieur
le
prince
where
i
could
catch
those
beautiful
carp
nor
the
forests
of
his
highness
to
provide
me
with
partridges
as
for
the
cellar
i
have
searched
every
part
and
poor
stuff
i
monsieur
mouston
said
d
artagnan
i
should
indeed
condole
with
you
had
i
not
at
this
moment
something
very
pressing
to
attend
then
taking
porthos
aside
my
dear
du
vallon
he
said
here
you
are
in
full
dress
most
fortunately
for
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
the
cardinal
gracious
me
really
exclaimed
porthos
opening
his
great
wondering
eyes
yes
my
a
presentation
indeed
does
that
alarm
you
no
but
it
agitates
oh
don
t
be
distressed
you
have
to
deal
with
a
cardinal
of
another
kind
this
one
will
not
oppress
you
by
his
tis
the
same
thing
you
understand
me
d
artagnan
a
there
s
no
court
now
alas
the
queen
i
was
going
to
say
there
s
no
longer
a
queen
the
queen
rest
assured
we
shall
not
see
and
you
say
that
we
are
going
from
here
to
the
palais
royal
immediately
only
that
there
may
be
no
delay
i
shall
borrow
one
of
your
certainly
all
the
four
are
at
your
oh
i
need
only
one
of
them
for
the
time
shall
we
take
our
valets
yes
you
may
as
well
take
mousqueton
as
to
planchet
he
has
certain
reasons
for
not
going
to
and
what
are
they
oh
he
doesn
t
stand
well
with
his
mouston
said
porthos
saddle
vulcan
and
and
for
myself
monsieur
shall
i
saddle
rustaud
no
take
a
more
stylish
horse
phoebus
or
superbe
we
are
going
with
some
ah
said
mousqueton
breathing
more
freely
you
are
only
going
then
to
make
a
visit
oh
yes
of
course
mouston
nothing
else
but
to
avoid
risk
put
the
pistols
in
the
holsters
you
will
find
mine
on
my
saddle
already
mouston
breathed
a
sigh
he
couldn
t
understand
visits
of
ceremony
made
under
arms
indeed
said
porthos
looking
complacently
at
his
old
lackey
as
he
went
away
you
are
right
d
artagnan
mouston
will
do
mouston
has
a
very
fine
d
artagnan
smiled
but
you
my
friend
are
you
not
going
to
change
your
dress
no
i
shall
go
as
i
am
this
traveling
dress
will
serve
to
show
the
cardinal
my
haste
to
obey
his
they
set
out
on
vulcan
and
bayard
followed
by
mousqueton
on
phoebus
and
arrived
at
the
palais
royal
at
about
a
quarter
to
seven
the
streets
were
crowded
for
it
was
the
day
of
pentecost
and
the
crowd
looked
in
wonder
at
these
two
cavaliers
one
as
fresh
as
if
he
had
come
out
of
a
bandbox
the
other
so
covered
with
dust
that
he
looked
as
if
he
had
but
just
come
off
a
field
of
battle
mousqueton
also
attracted
attention
and
as
the
romance
of
don
quixote
was
then
the
fashion
they
said
that
he
was
sancho
who
after
having
lost
one
master
had
found
two
on
reaching
the
palace
d
artagnan
sent
to
his
eminence
the
letter
in
which
he
had
been
ordered
to
return
without
delay
he
was
soon
ordered
to
the
presence
of
the
cardinal
courage
he
whispered
to
porthos
as
they
proceeded
do
not
be
intimidated
believe
me
the
eye
of
the
eagle
is
closed
forever
we
have
only
the
vulture
to
deal
with
hold
yourself
as
bolt
upright
as
on
the
day
of
the
bastion
of
gervais
and
do
not
bow
too
low
to
this
italian
that
might
give
him
a
poor
idea
of
good
answered
porthos
good
mazarin
was
in
his
study
working
at
a
list
of
pensions
and
benefices
of
which
he
was
trying
to
reduce
the
number
he
saw
d
artagnan
and
porthos
enter
with
internal
pleasure
yet
showed
no
joy
in
his
countenance
ah
you
is
it
monsieur
le
lieutenant
you
have
been
very
prompt
tis
well
welcome
to
thanks
my
lord
here
i
am
at
your
eminence
s
service
as
well
as
monsieur
du
vallon
one
of
my
old
friends
who
used
to
conceal
his
nobility
under
the
name
of
porthos
bowed
to
the
cardinal
a
magnificent
cavalier
remarked
mazarin
porthos
turned
his
head
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
and
drew
himself
up
with
a
movement
full
of
dignity
the
best
swordsman
in
the
kingdom
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
porthos
bowed
to
his
friend
mazarin
was
as
fond
of
fine
soldiers
as
in
later
times
frederick
of
prussia
used
to
be
he
admired
the
strong
hands
the
broad
shoulders
and
the
steady
eye
of
porthos
he
seemed
to
see
before
him
the
salvation
of
his
administration
and
of
the
kingdom
sculptured
in
flesh
and
bone
he
remembered
that
the
old
association
of
musketeers
was
composed
of
four
persons
and
your
two
other
friends
he
asked
porthos
opened
his
mouth
thinking
it
a
good
opportunity
to
put
in
a
word
in
his
turn
d
artagnan
checked
him
by
a
glance
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
they
are
prevented
at
this
moment
but
will
join
us
mazarin
coughed
a
little
and
this
gentleman
being
disengaged
takes
to
the
service
willingly
he
asked
yes
my
lord
and
from
pure
devotion
to
the
cause
for
monsieur
de
bracieux
is
rich
said
mazarin
whom
that
single
word
always
inspired
with
a
great
respect
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
said
porthos
these
were
the
first
words
he
had
spoken
from
pure
zeal
resumed
mazarin
with
his
artful
smile
from
pure
zeal
and
devotion
then
my
lord
has
perhaps
no
faith
in
those
words
said
d
artagnan
have
you
monsieur
le
gascon
asked
mazarin
supporting
his
elbows
on
his
desk
and
his
chin
on
his
hands
i
replied
the
gascon
i
believe
in
devotion
as
a
word
at
one
s
baptism
for
instance
which
naturally
comes
before
one
s
proper
name
every
one
is
naturally
more
or
less
devout
certainly
but
there
should
be
at
the
end
of
one
s
devotion
something
to
and
your
friend
for
instance
what
does
he
expect
to
have
at
the
end
of
his
devotion
well
my
lord
my
friend
has
three
magnificent
estates
that
of
vallon
at
corbeil
that
of
bracieux
in
the
soissonais
and
that
of
pierrefonds
in
the
valois
now
my
lord
he
would
like
to
have
one
of
his
three
estates
erected
into
a
only
that
said
mazarin
his
eyes
twinkling
with
joy
on
seeing
that
he
could
pay
for
porthos
s
devotion
without
opening
his
purse
only
that
that
can
be
i
shall
be
baron
explained
porthos
stepping
forward
i
told
you
so
said
d
artagnan
checking
him
with
his
hand
and
now
his
eminence
confirms
and
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
what
do
you
want
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
it
is
twenty
years
since
cardinal
de
richelieu
made
me
yes
and
you
would
be
gratified
if
cardinal
mazarin
should
make
you
d
artagnan
bowed
well
that
is
not
impossible
we
will
see
gentlemen
we
will
see
now
monsieur
de
vallon
said
mazarin
what
service
do
you
prefer
in
the
town
or
in
the
country
porthos
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
monsieur
de
vallon
is
like
me
he
prefers
service
extraordinary
that
is
to
say
enterprises
that
are
considered
mad
and
that
boastfulness
was
not
displeasing
to
mazarin
he
fell
into
meditation
and
yet
he
said
i
must
admit
that
i
sent
for
you
to
appoint
you
to
quiet
service
i
have
certain
apprehensions
well
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
in
fact
a
great
noise
was
heard
in
the
at
the
same
time
the
door
of
the
study
was
burst
open
and
a
man
covered
with
dust
rushed
into
it
exclaiming
my
lord
the
cardinal
my
lord
the
cardinal
mazarin
thought
that
some
one
was
going
to
assassinate
him
and
he
drew
back
pushing
his
chair
on
the
castors
d
artagnan
and
porthos
moved
so
as
to
plant
themselves
between
the
person
entering
and
the
cardinal
well
sir
exclaimed
mazarin
what
s
the
matter
and
why
do
you
rush
in
here
as
if
you
were
about
to
penetrate
a
crowded
my
lord
replied
the
messenger
i
wish
to
speak
to
your
eminence
in
secret
i
am
monsieur
du
poins
an
officer
in
the
guards
on
duty
at
the
donjon
of
mazarin
perceiving
by
the
paleness
and
agitation
of
the
messenger
that
he
had
something
of
importance
to
say
made
a
sign
that
d
artagnan
and
porthos
should
give
place
d
artagnan
and
porthos
withdrew
to
a
corner
of
the
cabinet
speak
monsieur
speak
at
once
said
mazarin
what
is
the
matter
the
matter
is
my
lord
that
the
duc
de
beaufort
has
contrived
to
escape
from
the
chateau
of
mazarin
uttered
a
cry
and
became
paler
than
the
man
who
had
brought
the
news
he
fell
back
almost
fainting
in
his
chair
escaped
monsieur
de
beaufort
escaped
my
lord
i
saw
him
run
off
from
the
top
of
the
and
you
did
not
fire
on
him
he
was
out
of
monsieur
de
chavigny
where
was
he
and
la
ramee
was
found
locked
up
in
the
prisoner
s
room
a
gag
in
his
mouth
and
a
poniard
near
but
the
man
who
was
under
him
was
an
accomplice
of
the
duke
s
and
escaped
along
with
mazarin
groaned
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
advancing
toward
the
cardinal
it
seems
to
me
that
your
eminence
is
losing
precious
time
it
may
still
be
possible
to
overtake
the
prisoner
france
is
large
the
nearest
frontier
is
sixty
leagues
and
who
is
to
pursue
him
cried
mazarin
i
pardieu
and
you
would
arrest
him
why
not
you
would
arrest
the
duc
de
beaufort
armed
in
the
field
if
your
eminence
should
order
me
to
arrest
the
devil
i
would
seize
him
by
the
horns
and
would
bring
him
so
would
i
said
porthos
so
would
you
said
mazarin
looking
with
astonishment
at
those
two
men
but
the
duke
will
not
yield
himself
without
a
furious
very
well
said
d
artagnan
his
eyes
aflame
battle
it
is
a
long
time
since
we
have
had
a
battle
eh
porthos
battle
cried
porthos
and
you
think
you
can
catch
him
yes
if
we
are
better
mounted
than
go
then
take
what
guards
you
find
here
and
pursue
you
command
us
my
lord
to
do
so
and
i
sign
my
orders
said
mazarin
taking
a
piece
of
paper
and
writing
some
lines
monsieur
du
vallon
your
barony
is
on
the
back
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
s
horse
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
overtake
it
as
for
you
my
dear
lieutenant
i
promise
you
nothing
but
if
you
bring
him
back
to
me
dead
or
alive
you
may
ask
all
you
to
horse
porthos
said
d
artagnan
taking
his
friend
by
the
hand
here
i
am
smiled
porthos
with
his
sublime
composure
they
descended
the
great
staircase
taking
with
them
all
the
guards
they
found
on
their
road
and
crying
out
to
arms
to
arms
and
immediately
put
spur
to
horse
which
set
off
along
the
rue
saint
honore
with
the
speed
of
the
whirlwind
well
baron
i
promise
you
some
good
exercise
said
the
gascon
yes
my
as
they
went
the
citizens
awakened
left
their
doors
and
the
street
dogs
followed
the
cavaliers
barking
at
the
corner
of
the
cimetiere
saint
jean
d
artagnan
upset
a
man
it
was
too
insignificant
an
occurrence
to
delay
people
so
eager
to
get
on
the
troop
continued
its
course
as
though
their
steeds
had
wings
alas
there
are
no
unimportant
events
in
this
world
and
we
shall
see
that
this
apparently
slight
incident
came
near
endangering
the
monarchy
an
adventure
on
the
high
road
the
musketeers
rode
the
whole
length
of
the
faubourg
saint
antoine
and
of
the
road
to
vincennes
and
soon
found
themselves
out
of
the
town
then
in
a
forest
and
then
within
sight
of
a
village
the
horses
seemed
to
become
more
lively
with
each
successive
step
their
nostrils
reddened
like
glowing
furnaces
d
artagnan
freely
applying
his
spurs
was
in
advance
of
porthos
two
feet
at
the
most
mousqueton
followed
two
lengths
behind
the
guards
were
scattered
according
to
the
varying
excellence
of
their
respective
mounts
from
the
top
of
an
eminence
d
artagnan
perceived
a
group
of
people
collected
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
in
front
of
that
part
of
the
donjon
which
looks
toward
saint
maur
he
rode
on
convinced
that
in
this
direction
he
would
gain
intelligence
of
the
fugitive
in
five
minutes
he
had
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
guards
joined
him
coming
up
one
by
one
the
several
members
of
that
group
were
much
excited
they
looked
at
the
cord
still
hanging
from
the
loophole
and
broken
at
about
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
their
eyes
measured
the
height
and
they
exchanged
conjectures
on
the
top
of
the
wall
sentinels
went
and
came
with
a
frightened
air
a
few
soldiers
commanded
by
a
sergeant
drove
away
idlers
from
the
place
where
the
duke
had
mounted
his
horse
d
artagnan
went
straight
to
the
sergeant
my
officer
said
the
sergeant
it
is
not
permitted
to
stop
that
prohibition
is
not
for
me
said
d
artagnan
have
the
fugitives
been
pursued
yes
my
officer
unfortunately
they
are
well
how
many
are
there
four
and
a
fifth
whom
they
carried
away
four
said
d
artagnan
looking
at
porthos
do
you
hear
baron
they
are
only
four
a
joyous
smile
lighted
porthos
s
face
how
long
a
start
have
they
two
hours
and
a
quarter
my
two
hours
and
a
quarter
that
is
nothing
we
are
well
mounted
are
we
not
porthos
porthos
breathed
a
sigh
he
thought
of
what
was
in
store
for
his
poor
horses
very
good
said
d
artagnan
and
now
in
what
direction
did
they
set
out
that
i
am
forbidden
to
d
artagnan
drew
from
his
pocket
a
paper
order
of
the
king
he
said
speak
to
the
governor
and
where
is
the
governor
in
the
anger
mounted
to
d
artagnan
s
face
he
frowned
and
his
cheeks
were
colored
ah
you
scoundrel
he
said
to
the
sergeant
i
believe
you
are
impudent
to
me
wait
he
unfolded
the
paper
presented
it
to
the
sergeant
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
took
a
pistol
from
his
holsters
and
cocked
it
order
of
the
king
i
tell
you
read
and
answer
or
i
will
blow
out
your
brains
the
sergeant
saw
that
d
artagnan
was
in
earnest
the
vendomois
road
he
replied
and
by
what
gate
did
they
go
out
by
the
saint
maur
if
you
are
deceiving
me
rascal
you
will
be
hanged
and
if
you
catch
up
with
them
you
won
t
come
back
to
hang
me
murmured
the
sergeant
d
artagnan
shrugged
his
shoulders
made
a
sign
to
his
escort
and
started
this
way
gentlemen
this
way
he
cried
directing
his
course
toward
the
gate
that
had
been
pointed
out
but
now
that
the
duke
had
escaped
the
concierge
had
seen
fit
to
fasten
the
gate
with
a
double
lock
it
was
necessary
to
compel
him
to
open
it
as
the
sergeant
had
been
compelled
to
speak
and
this
took
another
ten
minutes
this
last
obstacle
having
been
overcome
the
troop
pursued
their
course
with
their
accustomed
ardor
but
some
of
the
horses
could
no
longer
sustain
this
pace
three
of
them
stopped
after
an
hour
s
gallop
and
one
fell
down
d
artagnan
who
never
turned
his
head
did
not
perceive
it
porthos
told
him
of
it
in
his
calm
manner
if
only
we
two
arrive
said
d
artagnan
it
will
be
enough
since
the
duke
s
troop
are
only
four
in
that
is
true
said
porthos
and
he
spurred
his
courser
on
at
the
end
of
another
two
hours
the
horses
had
gone
twelve
leagues
without
stopping
their
legs
began
to
tremble
and
the
foam
they
shed
whitened
the
doublets
of
their
masters
let
us
rest
here
an
instant
to
give
these
poor
creatures
breathing
time
said
porthos
let
us
rather
kill
them
yes
kill
them
cried
d
artagnan
i
see
fresh
tracks
tis
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
since
they
passed
this
in
fact
the
road
was
trodden
by
horses
feet
visible
even
in
the
approaching
gloom
of
evening
they
set
out
after
a
run
of
two
leagues
mousqueton
s
horse
sank
gracious
me
said
porthos
there
s
phoebus
the
cardinal
will
pay
you
a
hundred
i
m
above
let
us
set
out
again
at
full
yes
if
we
but
at
last
the
lieutenant
s
horse
refused
to
go
on
he
could
not
breathe
one
last
spur
instead
of
making
him
advance
made
him
fall
the
devil
exclaimed
porthos
there
s
vulcan
zounds
cried
d
artagnan
then
we
must
stop
give
me
your
horse
porthos
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
by
jove
i
am
falling
or
rather
bayard
is
falling
answered
porthos
all
three
then
cried
all
s
hush
said
d
artagnan
what
is
it
i
hear
a
it
belongs
to
one
of
our
companions
who
is
overtaking
no
said
d
artagnan
it
is
in
that
is
another
thing
said
porthos
and
he
listened
toward
the
quarter
indicated
by
d
artagnan
monsieur
said
mousqueton
who
abandoning
his
horse
on
the
high
road
had
come
on
foot
to
rejoin
his
master
phoebus
could
no
longer
hold
out
and
silence
said
porthos
in
fact
at
that
moment
a
second
neighing
was
borne
to
them
on
the
night
wind
it
is
five
hundred
feet
from
here
in
advance
said
d
artagnan
true
monsieur
said
mousqueton
and
five
hundred
feet
from
here
is
a
small
mousqueton
thy
pistols
said
d
artagnan
i
have
them
at
hand
porthos
take
yours
from
your
i
have
good
said
d
artagnan
seizing
his
own
now
you
understand
porthos
not
too
we
are
out
on
the
king
s
well
for
the
king
s
service
we
need
that
is
true
said
porthos
then
not
a
word
but
set
to
work
they
went
on
through
the
darkness
silent
as
phantoms
they
saw
a
light
glimmering
in
the
midst
of
some
trees
yonder
is
the
house
porthos
said
the
gascon
let
me
do
what
i
please
and
do
you
what
i
they
glided
from
tree
to
tree
till
they
arrived
at
twenty
steps
from
the
house
unperceived
and
saw
by
means
of
a
lantern
suspended
under
a
hut
four
fine
horses
a
groom
was
rubbing
them
down
near
them
were
saddles
and
bridles
d
artagnan
approached
quickly
making
a
sign
to
his
two
companions
to
remain
a
few
steps
behind
i
buy
those
horses
he
said
to
the
groom
the
groom
turned
toward
him
with
a
look
of
surprise
but
made
no
reply
didn
t
you
hear
fellow
yes
i
why
then
didn
t
you
reply
because
these
horses
are
not
to
be
sold
was
the
reply
i
take
them
then
said
the
lieutenant
and
he
took
hold
of
one
within
his
reach
his
two
companions
did
the
same
thing
sir
cried
the
groom
they
have
traversed
six
leagues
and
have
only
been
unsaddled
half
an
half
an
hour
s
rest
is
enough
replied
the
gascon
the
groom
cried
aloud
for
help
a
kind
of
steward
appeared
just
as
d
artagnan
and
his
companions
were
prepared
to
mount
the
steward
attempted
to
expostulate
my
dear
friend
cried
the
lieutenant
if
you
say
a
word
i
will
blow
out
your
but
sir
answered
the
steward
do
you
know
that
these
horses
belong
to
monsieur
de
montbazon
so
much
the
better
they
must
be
good
animals
sir
i
shall
call
my
and
i
mine
i
ve
ten
guards
behind
me
don
t
you
hear
them
gallop
and
i
m
one
of
the
king
s
musketeers
come
porthos
come
they
all
mounted
the
horses
as
quickly
as
possible
halloo
hi
hi
cried
the
steward
the
house
servants
with
the
carbines
on
on
cried
d
artagnan
there
ll
be
firing
on
they
all
set
off
swift
as
the
wind
here
cried
the
steward
here
whilst
the
groom
ran
to
a
neighboring
building
take
care
of
your
horses
cried
d
artagnan
to
him
fire
replied
the
steward
a
gleam
like
a
flash
of
lightning
illumined
the
road
and
with
the
flash
was
heard
the
whistling
of
balls
which
were
fired
wildly
in
the
air
they
fire
like
grooms
said
porthos
in
the
time
of
the
cardinal
people
fired
better
than
that
do
you
remember
the
road
to
crevecoeur
mousqueton
ah
sir
my
left
side
still
pains
me
are
you
sure
we
are
on
the
right
track
lieutenant
egad
didn
t
you
hear
these
horses
belong
to
monsieur
de
montbazon
well
monsieur
de
montbazon
is
the
husband
of
madame
de
montbazon
and
and
madame
de
montbazon
is
the
mistress
of
the
duc
de
ah
i
understand
replied
porthos
she
has
ordered
relays
of
exactly
and
we
are
pursuing
the
duke
with
the
very
horses
he
has
just
left
my
dear
porthos
you
are
really
a
man
of
most
superior
understanding
said
d
artagnan
with
a
look
as
if
he
spoke
against
his
conviction
pooh
replied
porthos
i
am
what
i
they
rode
on
for
an
hour
till
the
horses
were
covered
with
foam
and
dust
zounds
what
is
yonder
cried
d
artagnan
you
are
very
lucky
if
you
see
anything
such
a
night
as
this
said
porthos
something
i
too
cried
mousqueton
saw
them
ah
ah
have
we
overtaken
them
good
a
dead
horse
said
d
artagnan
pulling
up
his
horse
which
shied
it
seems
their
horses
too
are
breaking
down
as
well
as
i
seem
to
hear
the
noise
of
a
troop
of
horsemen
exclaimed
porthos
leaning
over
his
horse
s
mane
they
appear
to
be
then
tis
something
another
horse
said
porthos
dead
no
saddled
yes
saddled
and
then
we
are
upon
the
courage
we
have
them
but
if
they
are
numerous
observed
mousqueton
tis
not
we
who
have
them
but
they
who
have
nonsense
cried
d
artagnan
they
ll
suppose
us
to
be
stronger
than
themselves
as
we
re
in
pursuit
they
ll
be
afraid
and
will
certainly
remarked
porthos
ah
do
you
see
cried
the
lieutenant
the
lights
again
this
time
i
too
saw
them
said
porthos
on
on
forward
forward
cried
d
artagnan
in
his
stentorian
voice
we
shall
laugh
over
all
this
in
five
and
they
darted
on
anew
the
horses
excited
by
pain
and
emulation
raced
over
the
dark
road
in
the
midst
of
which
was
now
seen
a
moving
mass
denser
and
more
obscure
than
the
rest
of
the
horizon
the
rencontre
they
rode
on
in
this
way
for
ten
minutes
suddenly
two
dark
forms
seemed
to
separate
from
the
mass
advanced
grew
in
size
and
as
they
loomed
up
larger
and
larger
assumed
the
appearance
of
two
horsemen
aha
cried
d
artagnan
they
re
coming
toward
so
much
the
worse
for
them
said
porthos
who
goes
there
cried
a
hoarse
voice
the
three
horsemen
made
no
reply
stopped
not
and
all
that
was
heard
was
the
noise
of
swords
drawn
from
the
scabbards
and
the
cocking
of
the
pistols
with
which
the
two
phantoms
were
armed
bridle
in
mouth
said
d
artagnan
porthos
understood
him
and
he
and
the
lieutenant
each
drew
with
the
left
hand
a
pistol
from
their
bolsters
and
cocked
it
in
their
turn
who
goes
there
was
asked
a
second
time
not
a
step
forward
or
you
re
dead
stuff
cried
porthos
almost
choked
with
dust
and
chewing
his
bridle
as
a
horse
chews
his
bit
stuff
and
nonsense
we
have
seen
plenty
of
dead
men
in
our
hearing
these
words
the
two
shadows
blockaded
the
road
and
by
the
light
of
the
stars
might
be
seen
the
shining
of
their
arms
back
shouted
d
artagnan
or
you
are
dead
two
shots
were
the
reply
to
this
threat
but
the
assailants
attacked
their
foes
with
such
velocity
that
in
a
moment
they
were
upon
them
a
third
was
heard
aimed
by
d
artagnan
and
one
of
his
adversaries
fell
as
for
porthos
he
assaulted
the
foe
with
such
violence
that
although
his
sword
was
thrust
aside
the
enemy
was
thrown
off
his
horse
and
fell
about
ten
steps
from
it
finish
mouston
finish
the
work
cried
porthos
and
he
darted
on
beside
his
friend
who
had
already
begun
a
fresh
pursuit
well
said
porthos
i
ve
broken
my
man
s
skull
cried
d
artagnan
and
you
i
ve
only
thrown
the
fellow
down
but
hark
another
shot
of
a
carbine
was
heard
it
was
mousqueton
who
was
obeying
his
master
s
command
on
on
cried
d
artagnan
all
goes
well
we
have
the
first
ha
ha
answered
porthos
behold
other
players
and
in
fact
two
other
cavaliers
made
their
appearance
detached
as
it
seemed
from
the
principal
group
they
again
disputed
the
road
this
time
the
lieutenant
did
not
wait
for
the
opposite
party
to
speak
stand
aside
he
cried
stand
off
the
road
what
do
you
want
asked
a
voice
the
duke
porthos
and
d
artagnan
roared
out
both
at
once
a
burst
of
laughter
was
the
answer
but
finished
with
a
groan
d
artagnan
had
with
his
sword
cut
in
two
the
poor
wretch
who
had
laughed
at
the
same
time
porthos
and
his
adversary
fired
on
each
other
and
d
artagnan
turned
to
him
bravo
you
ve
killed
him
i
no
wounded
his
horse
what
would
you
have
my
dear
fellow
one
doesn
t
hit
the
bull
every
time
it
is
something
to
hit
inside
the
ring
ho
parbleau
what
is
the
matter
with
my
horse
your
horse
is
falling
said
porthos
reining
in
his
own
in
truth
the
lieutenant
s
horse
stumbled
and
fell
on
his
knees
then
a
rattling
in
his
throat
was
heard
and
he
lay
down
to
die
he
had
received
in
the
chest
the
bullet
of
d
artagnan
s
first
adversary
d
artagnan
swore
loud
enough
to
be
heard
in
the
skies
does
your
honor
want
a
horse
asked
mousqueton
zounds
want
one
cried
the
gascon
here
s
one
your
honor
how
the
devil
hast
thou
two
horses
asked
d
artagnan
jumping
on
one
of
them
their
masters
are
dead
i
thought
they
might
be
useful
so
i
took
meantime
porthos
had
reloaded
his
pistols
be
on
the
qui
vive
cried
d
artagnan
here

two
other
as
he
spoke
two
horsemen
advanced
at
full
speed
ho
your
honor
cried
mousqueton
the
man
you
upset
is
getting
why
didn
t
thou
do
as
thou
didst
to
the
first
man
said
porthos
i
held
the
horses
my
hands
were
full
your
a
shot
was
fired
that
moment
mousqueton
shrieked
with
pain
ah
sir
i
m
hit
in
the
other
side
exactly
opposite
the
other
this
hurt
is
just
the
fellow
of
the
one
i
had
on
the
road
to
porthos
turned
around
like
a
lion
plunged
on
the
dismounted
cavalier
who
tried
to
draw
his
sword
but
before
it
was
out
of
the
scabbard
porthos
with
the
hilt
of
his
had
struck
him
such
a
terrible
blow
on
the
head
that
he
fell
like
an
ox
beneath
the
butcher
s
knife
mousqueton
groaning
slipped
from
his
horse
his
wound
not
allowing
him
to
keep
the
saddle
on
perceiving
the
cavaliers
d
artagnan
had
stopped
and
charged
his
pistol
afresh
besides
his
horse
he
found
had
a
carbine
on
the
bow
of
the
saddle
here
i
am
exclaimed
porthos
shall
we
wait
or
shall
we
charge
let
us
charge
them
answered
the
gascon
charge
cried
porthos
they
spurred
on
their
horses
the
other
cavaliers
were
only
twenty
steps
from
them
for
the
king
cried
d
artagnan
the
king
has
no
authority
here
answered
a
deep
voice
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
a
cloud
so
enveloped
was
the
cavalier
in
a
whirlwind
of
dust
tis
well
we
will
see
if
the
king
s
name
is
not
a
passport
everywhere
replied
the
gascon
see
answered
the
voice
two
shots
were
fired
at
once
one
by
d
artagnan
the
other
by
the
adversary
of
porthos
d
artagnan
s
ball
took
off
his
enemy
s
hat
the
ball
fired
by
porthos
s
foe
went
through
the
throat
of
his
horse
which
fell
groaning
for
the
last
time
where
are
you
going
to
the
devil
answered
d
artagnan
good
you
may
be
easy
then
you
ll
get
d
artagnan
then
saw
a
leveled
at
him
he
had
no
time
to
draw
from
his
holsters
he
recalled
a
bit
of
advice
which
athos
had
once
given
him
and
made
his
horse
rear
the
ball
struck
the
animal
full
in
front
d
artagnan
felt
his
horse
giving
way
under
him
and
with
his
wonderful
agility
threw
himself
to
one
side
ah
this
cried
the
voice
the
tone
of
which
was
at
once
polished
and
jeering
this
is
nothing
but
a
butchery
of
horses
and
not
a
combat
between
men
to
the
sword
sir
the
sword
and
he
jumped
off
his
horse
to
the
swords
be
it
so
replied
d
artagnan
that
is
exactly
what
i
d
artagnan
in
two
steps
was
engaged
with
the
foe
whom
according
to
custom
he
attacked
impetuously
but
he
met
this
time
with
a
skill
and
a
strength
of
arm
that
gave
him
pause
twice
he
was
obliged
to
step
back
his
opponent
stirred
not
one
inch
d
artagnan
returned
and
again
attacked
him
twice
or
thrice
thrusts
were
attempted
on
both
sides
without
effect
sparks
were
emitted
from
the
swords
like
water
spouting
forth
at
last
d
artagnan
thought
it
was
time
to
try
one
of
his
favorite
feints
in
fencing
he
brought
it
to
bear
skillfully
executed
it
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
and
struck
the
blow
with
a
force
which
he
fancied
would
prove
irresistible
the
blow
was
parried
sdeath
he
cried
with
his
gascon
accent
at
this
exclamation
his
adversary
bounded
back
and
bending
his
bare
head
tried
to
distinguish
in
the
gloom
the
features
of
the
lieutenant
as
to
d
artagnan
afraid
of
some
feint
he
still
stood
on
the
defensive
have
a
care
cried
porthos
to
his
opponent
i
ve
still
two
pistols
the
more
reason
you
should
fire
the
first
cried
his
foe
porthos
fired
the
flash
threw
a
gleam
of
light
over
the
field
of
battle
as
the
light
shone
on
them
a
cry
was
heard
from
the
other
two
combatants
athos
exclaimed
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
ejaculated
athos
athos
raised
his
sword
d
artagnan
lowered
his
aramis
cried
athos
don
t
fire
ah
ha
is
it
you
aramis
said
porthos
and
he
threw
away
his
pistol
aramis
pushed
his
back
into
his
and
sheathed
his
sword
my
son
exclaimed
athos
extending
his
hand
to
d
artagnan
this
was
the
name
which
he
gave
him
in
former
days
in
their
moments
of
tender
intimacy
athos
cried
d
artagnan
wringing
his
hands
so
you
defend
him
and
i
who
have
sworn
to
take
him
dead
or
alive
i
am
dishonored
and
by
you
kill
me
replied
athos
uncovering
his
breast
if
your
honor
requires
my
oh
woe
is
me
woe
is
me
cried
the
lieutenant
there
s
only
one
man
in
the
world
who
could
stay
my
hand
by
a
fatality
that
very
man
bars
my
way
what
shall
i
say
to
the
cardinal
you
can
tell
him
sir
answered
a
voice
which
was
the
voice
of
high
command
in
the
that
he
sent
against
me
the
only
two
men
capable
of
getting
the
better
of
four
men
of
fighting
man
to
man
without
discomfiture
against
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
chevalier
d
herblay
and
of
surrendering
only
to
fifty
men
the
prince
exclaimed
at
the
same
moment
athos
and
aramis
unmasking
as
they
addressed
the
duc
de
beaufort
whilst
d
artagnan
and
porthos
stepped
backward
fifty
cavaliers
cried
the
gascon
and
porthos
look
around
you
gentlemen
if
you
doubt
the
fact
said
the
duke
the
two
friends
looked
to
the
right
to
the
left
they
were
encompassed
by
a
troop
of
horsemen
hearing
the
noise
of
the
fight
resumed
the
duke
i
fancied
you
had
about
twenty
men
with
you
so
i
came
back
with
those
around
me
tired
of
always
running
away
and
wishing
to
draw
my
sword
in
my
own
cause
but
you
are
only
yes
my
lord
but
as
you
have
said
two
that
are
a
match
for
twenty
said
athos
come
gentlemen
your
swords
said
the
duke
our
swords
cried
d
artagnan
raising
his
head
and
regaining
his
never
never
added
porthos
some
of
the
men
moved
toward
them
one
moment
my
lord
whispered
athos
and
he
said
something
in
a
low
voice
as
you
will
replied
the
duke
i
am
too
much
indebted
to
you
to
refuse
your
first
request
gentlemen
he
said
to
his
escort
withdraw
monsieur
d
artagnan
monsieur
du
vallon
you
are
the
order
was
obeyed
d
artagnan
and
porthos
then
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
a
large
circle
now
d
herblay
said
athos
dismount
and
come
aramis
dismounted
and
went
to
porthos
whilst
athos
approached
d
artagnan
all
four
once
more
together
friends
said
athos
do
you
regret
you
have
not
shed
our
blood
no
replied
d
artagnan
i
regret
to
see
that
we
hitherto
united
are
opposed
to
each
other
ah
nothing
will
ever
go
well
with
us
hereafter
oh
heaven
no
all
is
over
said
porthos
well
be
on
our
side
now
resumed
aramis
silence
d
herblay
cried
athos
such
proposals
are
not
to
be
made
to
gentlemen
such
as
these
tis
a
matter
of
conscience
with
them
as
with
meantime
here
we
are
enemies
said
porthos
gramercy
who
would
ever
have
thought
it
d
artagnan
only
sighed
athos
looked
at
them
both
and
took
their
hands
in
his
gentlemen
he
said
this
is
a
serious
business
and
my
heart
bleeds
as
if
you
had
pierced
it
through
and
through
yes
we
are
severed
there
is
the
great
the
distressing
truth
but
we
have
not
as
yet
declared
war
perhaps
we
shall
have
to
make
certain
conditions
therefore
a
solemn
conference
is
for
my
own
part
i
demand
it
said
aramis
i
accept
it
interposed
d
artagnan
proudly
porthos
bowed
as
if
in
assent
let
us
choose
a
place
of
rendezvous
continued
athos
and
in
a
last
interview
arrange
our
mutual
position
and
the
conduct
we
are
to
maintain
toward
each
good
the
other
three
exclaimed
well
then
the
place
will
the
place
royale
suit
you
asked
d
artagnan
in
paris
athos
and
aramis
looked
at
each
other
the
place
royale
be
it
so
replied
athos
when
evening
if
you
like
at
what
hour
at
ten
in
the
evening
if
that
suits
you
by
that
time
we
shall
have
there
continued
athos
either
peace
or
war
will
be
decided
honor
at
all
events
will
be
maintained
alas
murmured
d
artagnan
our
honor
as
soldiers
is
lost
to
us
forever
d
artagnan
said
athos
gravely
i
assure
you
that
you
do
me
wrong
in
dwelling
so
upon
that
what
i
think
of
is
that
we
have
crossed
swords
as
enemies
yes
he
continued
sadly
shaking
his
head
yes
it
is
as
you
said
misfortune
indeed
has
overtaken
us
come
and
we
porthos
said
d
artagnan
will
return
carrying
our
shame
to
the
and
tell
him
cried
a
voice
that
i
am
not
too
old
yet
for
a
man
of
d
artagnan
recognized
the
voice
of
de
rochefort
can
i
do
anything
for
you
gentlemen
asked
the
duke
bear
witness
that
we
have
done
all
that
we
that
shall
be
testified
to
rest
assured
adieu
we
shall
meet
soon
i
trust
in
paris
where
you
shall
have
your
the
duke
as
he
spoke
kissed
his
hand
spurred
his
horse
into
a
gallop
and
disappeared
followed
by
his
troop
who
were
soon
lost
in
distance
and
darkness
d
artagnan
and
porthos
were
now
alone
with
a
man
who
held
by
the
bridles
two
horses
they
thought
it
was
mousqueton
and
went
up
to
him
what
do
i
see
cried
the
lieutenant
grimaud
is
it
thou
grimaud
signified
that
he
was
not
mistaken
and
whose
horses
are
these
cried
d
artagnan
who
has
given
them
to
us
said
porthos
the
comte
de
la
athos
athos
muttered
d
artagnan
you
think
of
every
one
you
are
indeed
a
nobleman
whither
art
thou
going
grimaud
to
join
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
in
flanders
your
they
were
taking
the
road
toward
paris
when
groans
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
a
ditch
attracted
their
attention
what
is
that
asked
d
artagnan
it
is
i
mousqueton
said
a
mournful
voice
whilst
a
sort
of
shadow
arose
out
of
the
side
of
the
road
porthos
ran
to
him
art
thou
dangerously
wounded
my
dear
mousqueton
he
said
no
sir
but
i
am
what
can
we
do
said
d
artagnan
we
must
return
to
i
will
take
care
of
mousqueton
said
grimaud
and
he
gave
his
arm
to
his
old
comrade
whose
eyes
were
full
of
tears
nor
could
grimaud
tell
whether
the
tears
were
caused
by
wounds
or
by
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
again
d
artagnan
and
porthos
went
on
meantime
to
paris
they
were
passed
by
a
sort
of
courier
covered
with
dust
the
bearer
of
a
letter
from
the
duke
to
the
cardinal
giving
testimony
to
the
valor
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
mazarin
had
passed
a
very
bad
night
when
this
letter
was
brought
to
him
announcing
that
the
duke
was
free
and
that
he
would
henceforth
raise
up
mortal
strife
against
him
what
consoles
me
said
the
cardinal
after
reading
the
letter
is
that
at
least
in
this
chase
d
artagnan
has
done
me
one
good
turn
he
has
destroyed
broussel
this
gascon
is
a
precious
fellow
even
his
misadventures
are
of
the
cardinal
referred
to
that
man
whom
d
artagnan
upset
at
the
corner
of
the
cimetiere
saint
jean
in
paris
and
who
was
no
other
than
the
councillor
broussel
the
four
old
friends
prepare
to
meet
again
well
said
porthos
seated
in
the
courtyard
of
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
to
d
artagnan
who
with
a
long
and
melancholy
face
had
returned
from
the
palais
royal
did
he
receive
you
ungraciously
my
dear
friend
i
faith
yes
a
brute
that
cardinal
what
are
you
eating
there
porthos
i
am
dipping
a
biscuit
in
a
glass
of
spanish
wine
do
the
you
are
right
gimblou
a
glass
of
well
how
has
all
gone
off
zounds
you
know
there
s
only
one
way
of
saying
things
so
i
went
in
and
said
my
lord
we
were
not
the
strongest
yes
i
know
that
he
said
but
give
me
the
you
know
porthos
i
could
not
give
him
the
particulars
without
naming
our
friends
to
name
them
would
be
to
commit
them
to
ruin
so
i
merely
said
they
were
fifty
and
we
were
two
there
was
firing
nevertheless
i
heard
he
said
and
your
swords
they
saw
the
light
of
day
i
presume
that
is
the
night
my
lord
i
answered
ah
cried
the
cardinal
i
thought
you
were
a
gascon
my
friend
i
am
a
gascon
said
i
only
when
i
the
answer
pleased
him
and
he
laughed
that
will
teach
me
he
said
to
have
my
guards
provided
with
better
horses
for
if
they
had
been
able
to
keep
up
with
you
and
if
each
one
of
them
had
done
as
much
as
you
and
your
friend
you
would
have
kept
your
word
and
would
have
brought
him
back
to
me
dead
or
well
there
s
nothing
bad
in
that
it
seems
to
me
said
porthos
oh
mon
dieu
no
nothing
at
all
it
was
the
way
in
which
he
spoke
it
is
incredible
how
these
biscuit
soak
up
wine
they
are
veritable
sponges
gimblou
another
the
bottle
was
brought
with
a
promptness
which
showed
the
degree
of
consideration
d
artagnan
enjoyed
in
the
establishment
he
continued
so
i
was
going
away
but
he
called
me
back
you
have
had
three
horses
foundered
or
killed
he
asked
me
yes
my
how
much
were
they
worth
why
said
porthos
that
was
very
good
of
him
it
seems
to
a
thousand
pistoles
i
a
thousand
pistoles
porthos
exclaimed
oh
oh
that
is
a
large
sum
if
he
knew
anything
about
horses
he
would
dispute
the
faith
he
was
very
much
inclined
to
do
so
the
contemptible
fellow
he
made
a
great
start
and
looked
at
me
i
also
looked
at
him
then
he
understood
and
putting
his
hand
into
a
drawer
he
took
from
it
a
quantity
of
notes
on
a
bank
in
for
a
thousand
pistoles
for
a
thousand
pistoles
just
that
amount
the
beggar
not
one
too
and
you
have
them
they
are
upon
my
word
i
think
he
acted
very
generously
to
men
who
had
risked
their
lives
for
him
and
besides
had
done
him
a
great
service
a
great
service
what
was
that
why
it
seems
that
i
crushed
for
him
a
parliament
what
that
little
man
in
black
that
you
upset
at
the
corner
of
saint
jean
cemetery
that
s
the
man
my
dear
fellow
he
was
an
annoyance
to
the
cardinal
unfortunately
i
didn
t
crush
him
flat
it
seems
that
he
came
to
himself
and
that
he
will
continue
to
be
an
see
that
now
said
porthos
and
i
turned
my
horse
aside
from
going
plump
on
to
him
that
will
be
for
another
he
owed
me
for
the
councillor
the
pettifogger
but
said
porthos
if
he
was
not
crushed
completely
ah
monsieur
de
richelieu
would
have
said
five
hundred
crowns
for
the
well
let
s
say
no
more
about
it
how
much
were
your
animals
worth
porthos
ah
if
poor
mousqueton
were
here
he
could
tell
you
to
a
no
matter
you
can
tell
within
ten
why
vulcan
and
bayard
cost
me
each
about
two
hundred
pistoles
and
putting
phoebus
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
we
should
be
pretty
near
the
there
will
remain
then
four
hundred
and
fifty
pistoles
said
d
artagnan
contentedly
yes
said
porthos
but
there
are
the
that
is
very
true
well
how
much
for
the
equipments
if
we
say
one
hundred
pistoles
for
the
three
good
for
the
hundred
pistoles
there
remains
then
three
hundred
and
porthos
made
a
sign
of
assent
we
will
give
the
fifty
pistoles
to
the
hostess
for
our
expenses
said
d
artagnan
and
share
the
three
we
will
share
said
porthos
a
paltry
piece
of
business
murmured
d
artagnan
crumpling
his
note
pooh
said
porthos
it
is
always
that
but
tell
me
what
didn
t
he
speak
of
me
in
any
way
ah
yes
indeed
cried
d
artagnan
who
was
afraid
of
disheartening
his
friend
by
telling
him
that
the
cardinal
had
not
breathed
a
word
about
him
yes
surely
he
said
he
said
resumed
porthos
stop
i
want
to
remember
his
exact
words
he
said
as
to
your
friend
tell
him
he
may
sleep
in
good
very
good
said
porthos
that
signified
as
clear
as
daylight
that
he
still
intends
to
make
me
a
at
this
moment
nine
o
clock
struck
d
artagnan
started
ah
yes
said
porthos
there
is
nine
o
clock
we
have
a
rendezvous
you
remember
at
the
place
ah
stop
hold
your
peace
porthos
don
t
remind
me
of
it
tis
that
which
has
made
me
so
cross
since
yesterday
i
shall
not
why
asked
porthos
because
it
is
a
grievous
thing
for
me
to
meet
again
those
two
men
who
caused
the
failure
of
our
and
yet
said
porthos
neither
of
them
had
any
advantage
over
us
i
still
had
a
loaded
pistol
and
you
were
in
full
fight
sword
in
yes
said
d
artagnan
but
what
if
this
rendezvous
had
some
hidden
purpose
oh
said
porthos
you
can
t
think
that
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
did
not
believe
athos
to
be
capable
of
a
deception
but
he
sought
an
excuse
for
not
going
to
the
rendezvous
we
must
go
said
the
superb
lord
of
bracieux
lest
they
should
say
we
were
afraid
we
who
have
faced
fifty
foes
on
the
high
road
can
well
meet
two
in
the
place
yes
yes
but
they
took
part
with
the
princes
without
apprising
us
of
it
athos
and
aramis
have
played
a
game
with
me
which
alarms
me
we
discovered
yesterday
the
truth
what
is
the
use
of
going
to
learn
something
else
you
really
have
some
distrust
then
said
porthos
of
aramis
yes
since
he
has
become
an
abbe
you
can
t
imagine
my
dear
fellow
the
sort
of
man
he
is
he
sees
us
on
the
road
which
leads
him
to
a
bishopric
and
perhaps
will
not
be
sorry
to
get
us
out
of
his
ah
as
regards
aramis
that
is
another
thing
said
porthos
and
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
at
perhaps
monsieur
de
beaufort
will
try
in
his
turn
to
lay
hands
on
nonsense
he
had
us
in
his
power
and
he
let
us
go
besides
we
can
be
on
our
guard
let
us
take
arms
let
planchet
post
himself
behind
us
with
his
planchet
is
a
frondeur
answered
d
artagnan
devil
take
these
civil
wars
one
can
no
more
now
reckon
on
one
s
friends
than
on
one
s
footmen
said
porthos
ah
if
mousqueton
were
here
there
s
a
fellow
who
will
never
desert
me
so
long
as
you
are
rich
ah
my
friend
tis
not
civil
war
that
disunites
us
it
is
that
we
are
each
of
us
twenty
years
older
it
is
that
the
honest
emotions
of
youth
have
given
place
to
suggestions
of
interest
whispers
of
ambition
counsels
of
selfishness
yes
you
are
right
let
us
go
porthos
but
let
us
go
well
armed
were
we
not
to
keep
the
rendezvous
they
would
declare
we
were
afraid
halloo
planchet
here
saddle
our
horses
take
your
whom
are
we
going
to
attack
sir
no
one
a
mere
matter
of
precaution
answered
the
gascon
you
know
sir
that
they
wished
to
murder
that
good
councillor
broussel
the
father
of
the
people
really
did
they
said
d
artagnan
yes
but
he
has
been
avenged
he
was
carried
home
in
the
arms
of
the
people
his
house
has
been
full
ever
since
he
has
received
visits
from
the
coadjutor
from
madame
de
longueville
and
the
prince
de
conti
madame
de
chevreuse
and
madame
de
vendome
have
left
their
names
at
his
door
and
now
whenever
he
wishes
well
whenever
he
wishes
planchet
began
to
sing
un
vent
de
fronde
s
est
leve
ce
matin
je
crois
qu
il
gronde
contre
le
mazarin
un
vent
de
fronde
s
est
leve
ce
it
doesn
t
surprise
me
said
d
artagnan
in
a
low
tone
to
porthos
that
mazarin
would
have
been
much
better
satisfied
had
i
crushed
the
life
out
of
his
you
understand
then
monsieur
resumed
planchet
that
if
it
were
for
some
enterprise
like
that
undertaken
against
monsieur
broussel
that
you
should
ask
me
to
take
my
carbine
no
don
t
be
alarmed
but
where
did
you
get
all
these
details
from
a
good
source
sir
i
heard
it
from
from
friquet
i
know
that
name
a
son
of
monsieur
de
broussel
s
servant
and
a
lad
that
i
promise
you
in
a
revolt
will
not
give
away
his
share
to
the
is
he
not
a
singing
boy
at
notre
dame
asked
d
artagnan
yes
that
is
the
very
boy
he
s
patronized
by
ah
yes
i
of
what
importance
is
this
little
reptile
to
you
asked
porthos
gad
replied
d
artagnan
he
has
already
given
me
good
information
and
he
may
do
the
same
whilst
all
this
was
going
on
athos
and
aramis
were
entering
paris
by
the
faubourg
antoine
they
had
taken
some
refreshment
on
the
road
and
hastened
on
that
they
might
not
fail
at
the
appointed
place
bazin
was
their
only
attendant
for
grimaud
had
stayed
behind
to
take
care
of
mousqueton
as
they
were
passing
onward
athos
proposed
that
they
should
lay
aside
their
arms
and
military
costume
and
assume
a
dress
more
suited
to
the
city
oh
no
dear
count
cried
aramis
is
it
not
a
warlike
encounter
that
we
are
going
to
what
do
you
mean
aramis
that
the
place
royale
is
the
termination
to
the
main
road
to
vendomois
and
nothing
what
our
friends
are
become
our
most
dangerous
enemies
athos
let
us
be
on
our
oh
my
dear
d
herblay
who
can
say
whether
d
artagnan
may
not
have
betrayed
us
to
the
cardinal
who
can
tell
whether
mazarin
may
not
take
advantage
of
this
rendezvous
to
seize
us
what
aramis
you
think
that
d
artagnan
that
porthos
would
lend
their
hands
to
such
an
infamy
among
friends
my
dear
athos
no
you
are
right
but
among
enemies
it
would
be
only
a
athos
crossed
his
arms
and
bowed
his
noble
head
what
can
you
expect
athos
men
are
so
made
and
we
are
not
always
twenty
years
old
we
have
cruelly
wounded
as
you
know
that
personal
pride
by
which
d
artagnan
is
blindly
governed
he
has
been
beaten
did
you
not
observe
his
despair
on
the
journey
as
to
porthos
his
barony
was
perhaps
dependent
on
that
affair
well
he
found
us
on
his
road
and
will
not
be
baron
this
time
perhaps
that
famous
barony
will
have
something
to
do
with
our
interview
this
evening
let
us
take
our
precautions
but
suppose
they
come
unarmed
what
a
disgrace
to
oh
never
fear
besides
if
they
do
we
can
easily
make
an
excuse
we
came
straight
off
a
journey
and
are
insurgents
an
excuse
for
us
to
meet
d
artagnan
with
a
false
excuse
to
have
to
make
a
false
excuse
to
porthos
oh
aramis
continued
athos
shaking
his
head
mournfully
upon
my
soul
you
make
me
the
most
miserable
of
men
you
disenchant
a
heart
not
wholly
dead
to
friendship
go
in
whatever
guise
you
choose
for
my
part
i
shall
go
no
for
i
will
not
allow
you
to
do
so
tis
not
one
man
not
athos
only
not
the
comte
de
la
fere
whom
you
will
ruin
by
this
amiable
weakness
but
a
whole
party
to
whom
you
belong
and
who
depend
upon
be
it
so
then
replied
athos
sorrowfully
and
they
pursued
their
road
in
mournful
silence
scarcely
had
they
reached
by
the
rue
de
la
mule
the
iron
gate
of
the
place
royale
when
they
perceived
three
cavaliers
d
artagnan
porthos
and
planchet
the
two
former
wrapped
up
in
their
military
cloaks
under
which
their
swords
were
hidden
and
planchet
his
musket
by
his
side
they
were
waiting
at
the
entrance
of
the
rue
sainte
catharine
and
their
horses
were
fastened
to
the
rings
of
the
arcade
athos
therefore
commanded
bazin
to
fasten
up
his
horse
and
that
of
aramis
in
the
same
manner
they
then
advanced
two
and
two
and
saluted
each
other
politely
now
where
will
it
be
agreeable
to
you
that
we
hold
our
conference
inquired
aramis
perceiving
that
people
were
stopping
to
look
at
them
supposing
that
they
were
going
to
engage
in
one
of
those
duels
still
extant
in
the
memory
of
the
parisians
and
especially
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
royale
the
gate
is
shut
said
aramis
but
if
these
gentlemen
like
a
cool
retreat
under
the
trees
and
perfect
seclusion
i
will
get
the
key
from
the
hotel
de
rohan
and
we
shall
be
well
d
artagnan
darted
a
look
into
the
obscurity
of
the
place
porthos
ventured
to
put
his
head
between
the
railings
to
try
if
his
glance
could
penetrate
the
gloom
if
you
prefer
any
other
place
said
athos
in
his
persuasive
voice
choose
for
this
place
if
monsieur
d
herblay
can
procure
the
key
is
the
best
that
we
can
have
was
the
answer
aramis
went
off
at
once
begging
athos
not
to
remain
alone
within
reach
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
a
piece
of
advice
which
was
received
with
a
contemptuous
smile
aramis
returned
soon
with
a
man
from
the
hotel
de
rohan
who
was
saying
to
him
you
swear
sir
that
it
is
not
so
stop
and
aramis
gave
him
a
louis
d
or
ah
you
will
not
swear
my
master
said
the
concierge
shaking
his
head
well
one
can
never
say
what
may
happen
at
present
we
and
these
gentlemen
are
excellent
yes
certainly
added
athos
and
the
other
two
d
artagnan
had
heard
the
conversation
and
had
understood
it
you
see
he
said
to
porthos
what
do
i
see
that
he
wouldn
t
swear
what
that
man
wanted
aramis
to
swear
that
we
are
not
going
to
the
place
royale
to
and
aramis
wouldn
t
swear
attention
then
athos
did
not
lose
sight
of
the
two
speakers
aramis
opened
the
gate
and
faced
around
in
order
that
d
artagnan
and
porthos
might
enter
in
passing
through
the
gate
the
hilt
of
the
lieutenant
s
sword
was
caught
in
the
grating
and
he
was
obliged
to
pull
off
his
cloak
in
doing
so
he
showed
the
butt
end
of
his
pistols
and
a
ray
of
the
moon
was
reflected
on
the
shining
metal
do
you
see
whispered
aramis
to
athos
touching
his
shoulder
with
one
hand
and
pointing
with
the
other
to
the
arms
which
the
gascon
wore
under
his
belt
alas
i
do
replied
athos
with
a
deep
sigh
he
entered
third
and
aramis
who
shut
the
gate
after
him
last
the
two
waited
without
but
as
if
they
likewise
mistrusted
each
other
they
kept
their
respective
distances
the
place
royale
they
proceeded
silently
to
the
centre
of
the
place
but
as
at
this
very
moment
the
moon
had
just
emerged
from
behind
a
cloud
they
thought
they
might
be
observed
if
they
remained
on
that
spot
and
therefore
regained
the
shade
of
the
there
were
benches
here
and
there
the
four
gentlemen
stopped
near
them
at
a
sign
from
athos
porthos
and
d
artagnan
sat
down
the
two
others
stood
in
front
of
them
after
a
few
minutes
of
silent
embarrassment
athos
spoke
gentlemen
he
said
our
presence
here
is
the
best
proof
of
former
friendship
not
one
of
us
has
failed
the
others
at
this
rendezvous
not
one
has
therefore
to
reproach
hear
me
count
replied
d
artagnan
instead
of
making
compliments
to
each
other
let
us
explain
our
conduct
to
each
other
like
men
of
right
and
honest
i
wish
for
nothing
more
have
you
any
cause
of
complaint
against
me
or
monsieur
d
herblay
if
so
speak
out
answered
athos
i
have
replied
d
artagnan
when
i
saw
you
at
your
chateau
at
bragelonne
i
made
certain
proposals
to
you
which
you
perfectly
understood
instead
of
answering
me
as
a
friend
you
played
with
me
as
a
child
the
friendship
therefore
that
you
boast
of
was
not
broken
yesterday
by
the
shock
of
swords
but
by
your
dissimulation
at
your
d
artagnan
said
athos
reproachfully
you
asked
for
candor
and
you
have
it
you
ask
what
i
have
against
you
i
tell
you
and
i
have
the
same
sincerity
to
show
you
if
you
wish
monsieur
d
herblay
i
acted
in
a
similar
way
to
you
and
you
also
deceived
really
monsieur
you
say
strange
things
said
aramis
you
came
seeking
me
to
make
to
me
certain
proposals
but
did
you
make
them
no
you
sounded
me
nothing
more
very
well
what
did
i
say
to
you
that
mazarin
was
contemptible
and
that
i
wouldn
t
serve
mazarin
but
that
is
all
did
i
tell
you
that
i
wouldn
t
serve
any
other
on
the
contrary
i
gave
you
to
understand
i
think
that
i
adhered
to
the
princes
we
even
joked
very
pleasantly
if
i
remember
rightly
on
the
very
probable
contingency
of
your
being
charged
by
the
cardinal
with
my
arrest
were
you
a
party
man
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
well
why
should
not
we
too
belong
to
a
party
you
had
your
secret
and
we
had
ours
we
didn
t
exchange
them
so
much
the
better
it
proves
that
we
know
how
to
keep
our
i
do
not
reproach
you
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
tis
only
because
monsieur
de
la
fere
has
spoken
of
friendship
that
i
question
your
and
what
do
you
find
in
it
that
is
worthy
of
blame
asked
aramis
haughtily
the
blood
mounted
instantly
to
the
temples
of
d
artagnan
who
arose
and
replied
i
consider
it
worthy
conduct
of
a
pupil
of
on
seeing
d
artagnan
rise
porthos
rose
also
these
four
men
were
therefore
all
standing
at
the
same
time
with
a
menacing
aspect
opposite
to
each
other
upon
hearing
d
artagnan
s
reply
aramis
seemed
about
to
draw
his
sword
when
athos
prevented
him
d
artagnan
he
said
you
are
here
still
infuriated
by
yesterday
s
adventure
i
believed
your
heart
noble
enough
to
enable
a
friendship
of
twenty
years
to
overcome
an
affront
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
come
do
you
really
think
you
have
anything
to
say
against
me
say
it
then
if
i
am
in
fault
i
will
avow
the
the
grave
and
harmonious
tones
of
that
beloved
voice
seemed
to
have
still
its
ancient
influence
whilst
that
of
aramis
which
had
become
harsh
and
tuneless
in
his
moments
of
irritated
him
he
answered
therefore
i
think
monsieur
le
comte
that
you
had
something
to
communicate
to
me
at
your
chateau
of
bragelonne
and
that
gentleman
he
pointed
to
aramis
had
also
something
to
tell
me
when
i
was
in
his
convent
at
that
time
i
was
not
concerned
in
the
adventure
in
the
course
of
which
you
have
so
successfully
estopped
me
however
because
i
was
prudent
you
must
not
take
me
for
a
fool
if
i
had
wished
to
widen
the
breach
between
those
whom
monsieur
d
herblay
chooses
to
receive
with
a
rope
ladder
and
those
whom
he
receives
with
a
wooden
ladder
i
could
have
spoken
what
are
you
meddling
with
cried
aramis
pale
with
anger
suspecting
that
d
artagnan
had
acted
as
a
spy
on
him
and
had
seen
him
with
madame
de
longueville
i
never
meddle
save
with
what
concerns
me
and
i
know
how
to
make
believe
that
i
haven
t
seen
what
does
not
concern
me
but
i
hate
hypocrites
and
among
that
number
i
place
musketeers
who
are
abbes
and
abbes
who
are
musketeers
and
he
added
turning
to
porthos
here
s
a
gentleman
who
s
of
the
same
opinion
as
porthos
who
had
not
spoken
one
word
answered
merely
by
a
word
and
a
gesture
he
said
yes
and
he
put
his
hand
on
his
sword
aramis
started
back
and
drew
his
d
artagnan
bent
forward
ready
either
to
attack
or
to
stand
on
his
defense
athos
at
that
moment
extended
his
hand
with
the
air
of
supreme
command
which
characterized
him
alone
drew
out
his
sword
and
the
scabbard
at
the
same
time
broke
the
blade
in
the
sheath
on
his
knee
and
threw
the
pieces
to
his
right
then
turning
to
aramis
aramis
he
said
break
your
aramis
hesitated
it
must
be
done
said
athos
then
in
a
lower
and
more
gentle
voice
he
added
i
wish
then
aramis
paler
than
before
but
subdued
by
these
words
snapped
the
serpent
blade
between
his
hands
and
then
folding
his
arms
stood
trembling
with
rage
these
proceedings
made
d
artagnan
and
porthos
draw
back
d
artagnan
did
not
draw
his
sword
porthos
put
his
back
into
the
sheath
never
exclaimed
athos
raising
his
right
hand
to
heaven
never
i
swear
before
god
who
seeth
us
and
who
in
the
darkness
of
this
night
heareth
us
never
shall
my
sword
cross
yours
never
my
eye
express
a
glance
of
anger
nor
my
heart
a
throb
of
hatred
at
you
we
lived
together
we
loved
we
hated
together
we
shed
we
mingled
our
blood
together
and
too
probably
i
may
still
add
that
there
may
be
yet
a
bond
between
us
closer
even
than
that
of
friendship
perhaps
there
may
be
the
bond
of
crime
for
we
four
we
once
did
condemn
judge
and
slay
a
human
being
whom
we
had
not
any
right
to
cut
off
from
this
world
although
apparently
fitter
for
hell
than
for
this
life
d
artagnan
i
have
always
loved
you
as
my
son
porthos
we
slept
six
years
side
by
side
aramis
is
your
brother
as
well
as
mine
and
aramis
has
once
loved
you
as
i
love
you
now
and
as
i
have
ever
loved
you
what
can
cardinal
mazarin
be
to
us
to
four
men
who
compelled
such
a
man
as
richelieu
to
act
as
we
pleased
what
is
such
or
such
a
prince
to
us
who
fixed
the
diadem
upon
a
great
queen
s
head
d
artagnan
i
ask
your
pardon
for
having
yesterday
crossed
swords
with
you
aramis
does
the
same
to
porthos
now
hate
me
if
you
can
but
for
my
own
part
i
shall
ever
even
if
you
do
hate
me
retain
esteem
and
friendship
for
you
i
repeat
my
words
aramis
and
then
if
you
desire
it
and
if
they
desire
it
let
us
separate
forever
from
our
old
there
was
a
solemn
though
momentary
silence
which
was
broken
by
aramis
i
swear
he
said
with
a
calm
brow
and
kindly
glance
but
in
a
voice
still
trembling
with
recent
emotion
i
swear
that
i
no
longer
bear
animosity
to
those
who
were
once
my
friends
i
regret
that
i
ever
crossed
swords
with
you
porthos
i
swear
not
only
that
it
shall
never
again
be
pointed
at
your
breast
but
that
in
the
bottom
of
my
heart
there
will
never
in
future
be
the
slightest
hostile
sentiment
now
athos
athos
was
about
to
retire
oh
no
no
do
not
go
away
exclaimed
d
artagnan
impelled
by
one
of
those
irresistible
impulses
which
showed
the
nobility
of
his
nature
the
native
brightness
of
his
character
i
swear
that
i
would
give
the
last
drop
of
my
blood
and
the
last
fragment
of
my
limbs
to
preserve
the
friendship
of
such
a
friend
as
you
athos
of
such
a
man
as
you
and
he
threw
himself
into
the
arms
of
athos
my
son
exclaimed
athos
pressing
him
in
his
arms
and
as
for
me
said
porthos
i
swear
nothing
but
i
m
choked
forsooth
if
i
were
obliged
to
fight
against
you
i
think
i
should
allow
myself
to
be
pierced
through
and
through
for
i
never
loved
any
one
but
you
in
the
wide
world
and
honest
porthos
burst
into
tears
as
he
embraced
athos
my
friends
said
athos
this
is
what
i
expected
from
such
hearts
as
yours
yes
i
have
said
it
and
i
now
repeat
it
our
destinies
are
irrevocably
united
although
we
now
pursue
divergent
roads
i
respect
your
convictions
and
whilst
we
fight
for
opposite
sides
let
us
remain
friends
ministers
princes
kings
will
pass
away
like
mountain
torrents
civil
war
like
a
forest
flame
but
we
we
shall
remain
i
have
a
presentiment
that
we
yes
replied
d
artagnan
let
us
still
be
musketeers
and
let
us
retain
as
our
that
famous
napkin
of
the
bastion
gervais
on
which
the
great
cardinal
had
three
be
it
so
cried
aramis
cardinalists
or
frondeurs
what
matters
it
let
us
meet
again
as
capital
seconds
in
a
duel
devoted
friends
in
business
merry
companions
in
our
ancient
and
whenever
added
athos
we
meet
in
battle
at
this
word
place
royale
let
us
put
our
swords
into
our
left
hands
and
shake
hands
with
the
right
even
in
the
very
lust
and
music
of
the
hottest
you
speak
charmingly
said
porthos
and
are
the
first
of
men
added
d
artagnan
you
excel
us
athos
smiled
with
ineffable
pleasure
tis
then
all
settled
gentlemen
your
hands
are
we
not
pretty
good
christians
egad
said
d
artagnan
by
heaven
we
should
be
so
on
this
occasion
if
only
to
be
faithful
to
our
oath
said
aramis
ah
i
m
ready
to
do
what
you
will
cried
porthos
even
to
swear
by
mahomet
devil
take
me
if
i
ve
ever
been
so
happy
as
at
this
and
he
wiped
his
eyes
still
moist
has
not
one
of
you
a
cross
asked
athos
aramis
smiled
and
drew
from
his
vest
a
cross
of
diamonds
which
was
hung
around
his
neck
by
a
chain
of
pearls
here
is
one
he
said
well
resumed
athos
swear
on
this
cross
which
in
spite
of
its
magnificent
material
is
still
a
cross
swear
to
be
united
in
spite
of
everything
and
forever
and
may
this
oath
bind
us
to
each
other
and
even
also
our
descendants
does
this
oath
satisfy
you
yes
said
they
all
with
one
accord
ah
traitor
muttered
d
artagnan
leaning
toward
aramis
and
whispering
in
his
ear
you
have
made
us
swear
on
the
crucifix
of
a
the
ferry
across
the
oise
we
hope
that
the
reader
has
not
quite
forgotten
the
young
traveler
whom
we
left
on
the
road
to
flanders
in
losing
sight
of
his
guardian
whom
he
had
quitted
gazing
after
him
in
front
of
the
royal
basilican
raoul
spurred
on
his
horse
in
order
not
only
to
escape
from
his
own
melancholy
reflections
but
also
to
hide
from
olivain
the
emotion
his
face
might
betray
one
hour
s
rapid
progress
however
sufficed
to
disperse
the
gloomy
fancies
that
had
clouded
the
young
man
s
bright
anticipations
and
the
hitherto
unfelt
pleasure
of
freedom
a
pleasure
which
is
sweet
even
to
those
who
have
never
known
dependence
seemed
to
raoul
to
gild
not
only
heaven
and
earth
but
especially
that
blue
but
dim
horizon
of
life
we
call
the
future
nevertheless
after
several
attempts
at
conversation
with
olivain
he
foresaw
that
many
days
passed
thus
would
prove
exceedingly
dull
and
the
count
s
agreeable
voice
his
gentle
and
persuasive
eloquence
recurred
to
his
mind
at
the
various
towns
through
which
they
journeyed
and
about
which
he
had
no
longer
any
one
to
give
him
those
interesting
details
which
he
would
have
drawn
from
athos
the
most
amusing
and
the
best
informed
of
guides
another
recollection
contributed
also
to
sadden
raoul
on
their
arrival
at
sonores
he
had
perceived
hidden
behind
a
screen
of
poplars
a
little
chateau
which
so
vividly
recalled
that
of
la
valliere
to
his
mind
that
he
halted
for
nearly
ten
minutes
to
gaze
at
it
and
resumed
his
journey
with
a
sigh
too
abstracted
even
to
reply
to
olivain
s
respectful
inquiry
about
the
cause
of
so
much
fixed
attention
the
aspect
of
external
objects
is
often
a
mysterious
guide
communicating
with
the
fibres
of
memory
which
in
spite
of
us
will
arouse
them
at
times
this
thread
like
that
of
ariadne
when
once
unraveled
will
conduct
one
through
a
labyrinth
of
thought
in
which
one
loses
one
s
self
in
endeavoring
to
follow
that
phantom
of
the
past
which
is
called
recollection
now
the
sight
of
this
chateau
had
taken
raoul
back
fifty
leagues
westward
and
had
caused
him
to
review
his
life
from
the
moment
when
he
had
taken
leave
of
little
louise
to
that
in
which
he
had
seen
her
for
the
first
time
and
every
branch
of
oak
every
gilded
weathercock
on
roof
of
slates
reminded
him
that
instead
of
returning
to
the
friends
of
his
childhood
every
instant
estranged
him
further
and
that
perhaps
he
had
even
left
them
forever
with
a
full
heart
and
burning
head
he
desired
olivain
to
lead
on
the
horses
to
a
wayside
inn
which
he
observed
within
gunshot
range
a
little
in
advance
of
the
place
they
had
reached
as
for
himself
he
dismounted
and
remained
under
a
beautiful
group
of
chestnuts
in
flower
amidst
which
were
murmuring
a
multitude
of
happy
bees
and
bade
olivain
send
the
host
to
him
with
writing
paper
and
ink
to
be
placed
on
a
table
which
he
found
there
conveniently
ready
olivain
obeyed
and
continued
on
his
way
whilst
raoul
remained
sitting
with
his
elbow
leaning
on
the
table
from
time
to
time
gently
shaking
the
flowers
from
his
head
which
fell
upon
him
like
snow
and
gazing
vaguely
on
the
charming
landscape
spread
out
before
him
dotted
over
with
green
fields
and
groups
of
trees
raoul
had
been
there
about
ten
minutes
during
five
of
which
he
was
lost
in
reverie
when
there
appeared
within
the
circle
comprised
in
his
rolling
gaze
a
man
with
a
rubicund
face
who
with
a
napkin
around
his
body
another
under
his
arm
and
a
white
cap
upon
his
head
approached
him
holding
paper
pen
and
ink
in
hand
ha
ha
laughed
the
apparition
every
gentleman
seems
to
have
the
same
fancy
for
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
a
young
lad
well
mounted
like
you
as
tall
as
you
and
of
about
your
age
halted
before
this
clump
of
trees
and
had
this
table
and
this
chair
brought
here
and
dined
here
with
an
old
gentleman
who
seemed
to
be
his
tutor
upon
a
pie
of
which
they
haven
t
left
a
mouthful
and
two
bottles
of
macon
wine
of
which
they
haven
t
left
a
drop
but
fortunately
we
have
still
some
of
the
same
wine
and
some
of
the
same
pies
left
and
if
your
worship
will
but
give
your
orders
no
friend
replied
raoul
smiling
i
am
obliged
to
you
but
at
this
moment
i
want
nothing
but
the
things
for
which
i
have
asked
only
i
shall
be
very
glad
if
the
ink
prove
black
and
the
pen
good
upon
these
conditions
i
will
pay
for
the
pen
the
price
of
the
bottle
and
for
the
ink
the
price
of
the
very
well
sir
said
the
host
i
ll
give
the
pie
and
the
bottle
of
wine
to
your
servant
and
in
this
way
you
will
have
the
pen
and
ink
into
the
do
as
you
like
said
raoul
who
was
beginning
his
apprenticeship
with
that
particular
class
of
society
who
when
there
were
robbers
on
the
highroads
were
connected
with
them
and
who
since
highwaymen
no
longer
exist
have
advantageously
and
aptly
filled
their
vacant
place
the
host
his
mind
at
ease
about
his
bill
placed
pen
ink
and
paper
upon
the
table
by
a
lucky
chance
the
pen
was
tolerably
good
and
raoul
began
to
write
the
host
remained
standing
in
front
of
him
looking
with
a
kind
of
involuntary
admiration
at
his
handsome
face
combining
both
gravity
and
sweetness
of
expression
beauty
has
always
been
and
always
will
be
he
s
not
a
guest
like
the
other
one
here
just
now
observed
mine
host
to
olivain
who
had
rejoined
his
master
to
see
if
he
wanted
anything
and
your
young
master
has
no
my
master
had
appetite
enough
three
days
ago
but
what
can
one
do
he
lost
it
the
day
before
and
olivain
and
the
host
took
their
way
together
toward
the
inn
olivain
according
to
the
custom
of
well
pleased
with
their
place
relating
to
the
all
that
he
could
say
in
favor
of
the
young
gentleman
whilst
raoul
wrote
on
thus
sir
after
a
four
hours
march
i
stop
to
write
to
you
for
i
miss
you
every
moment
and
i
am
always
on
the
point
of
turning
my
head
as
if
to
reply
when
you
speak
to
me
i
was
so
bewildered
by
your
departure
and
so
overcome
with
grief
at
our
separation
that
i
am
sure
i
was
able
to
but
very
feebly
express
all
the
affection
and
gratitude
i
feel
toward
you
you
will
forgive
me
sir
for
your
heart
is
of
such
a
generous
nature
that
you
can
well
understand
all
that
has
passed
in
mine
i
entreat
you
to
write
to
me
for
you
form
a
part
of
my
existence
and
if
i
may
venture
to
tell
you
so
i
also
feel
anxious
it
seemed
to
me
as
if
you
were
yourself
preparing
for
some
dangerous
undertaking
about
which
i
did
not
dare
to
question
you
since
you
told
me
nothing
i
have
therefore
as
you
see
great
need
of
hearing
from
you
now
that
you
are
no
longer
beside
me
i
am
afraid
every
moment
of
erring
you
sustained
me
powerfully
sir
and
i
protest
to
you
that
i
feel
very
lonely
will
you
have
the
goodness
sir
should
you
receive
news
from
blois
to
send
me
a
few
lines
about
my
little
friend
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
about
whose
health
when
we
left
so
much
anxiety
was
felt
you
can
understand
honored
and
dear
guardian
how
precious
and
indispensable
to
me
is
the
remembrance
of
the
years
that
i
have
passed
with
you
i
hope
that
you
will
sometimes
too
think
of
me
and
if
at
certain
hours
you
should
miss
me
if
you
should
feel
any
slight
regret
at
my
absence
i
shall
be
overwhelmed
with
joy
at
the
thought
that
you
appreciate
my
affection
for
and
my
devotion
to
yourself
and
that
i
have
been
able
to
prove
them
to
you
whilst
i
had
the
happiness
of
living
with
after
finishing
this
letter
raoul
felt
more
composed
he
looked
well
around
him
to
see
if
olivain
and
the
host
might
not
be
watching
him
whilst
he
impressed
a
kiss
upon
the
paper
a
mute
and
touching
caress
which
the
heart
of
athos
might
well
divine
on
opening
the
letter
during
this
time
olivain
had
finished
his
bottle
and
eaten
his
pie
the
horses
were
also
refreshed
raoul
motioned
to
the
host
to
approach
threw
a
crown
upon
the
table
mounted
his
horse
and
posted
his
letter
at
senlis
the
rest
that
had
been
thus
afforded
to
men
and
horses
enabled
them
to
continue
their
journey
at
a
good
round
pace
at
verberie
raoul
desired
olivain
to
make
some
inquiry
about
the
young
man
who
was
preceding
them
he
had
been
observed
to
pass
only
of
an
hour
previously
but
he
was
well
mounted
as
the
had
already
said
and
rode
at
a
rapid
pace
let
us
try
and
overtake
this
gentleman
said
raoul
to
olivain
like
ourselves
he
is
on
his
way
to
join
the
army
and
may
prove
agreeable
it
was
about
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
when
raoul
arrived
at
compiegne
there
he
dined
heartily
and
again
inquired
about
the
young
gentleman
who
was
in
advance
of
them
he
had
stopped
like
raoul
at
the
hotel
of
the
bell
and
bottle
the
best
at
compiegne
and
had
started
again
on
his
journey
saying
that
he
should
sleep
at
noyon
well
let
us
sleep
at
noyon
said
raoul
sir
replied
olivain
respectfully
allow
me
to
remark
that
we
have
already
much
fatigued
the
horses
this
morning
i
think
it
would
be
well
to
sleep
here
and
to
start
again
very
early
eighteen
leagues
is
enough
for
the
first
the
comte
de
la
fere
wished
me
to
hasten
on
replied
raoul
that
i
might
rejoin
the
prince
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
let
us
push
on
then
to
noyon
it
will
be
a
stage
similar
to
those
we
traveled
from
blois
to
paris
we
shall
arrive
at
eight
o
clock
the
horses
will
have
a
long
night
s
rest
and
at
five
o
clock
morning
we
can
be
again
on
the
olivain
dared
offer
no
opposition
to
this
determination
but
he
followed
his
master
grumbling
go
on
go
on
said
he
between
his
teeth
expend
your
ardor
the
first
day
instead
of
journeying
twenty
leagues
you
will
travel
ten
the
day
after
five
and
in
three
days
you
will
be
in
bed
there
you
must
rest
young
people
are
such
it
was
easy
to
see
that
olivain
had
not
been
taught
in
the
school
of
the
planchets
and
the
grimauds
raoul
really
felt
tired
but
he
was
desirous
of
testing
his
strength
and
brought
up
in
the
principles
of
athos
and
certain
of
having
heard
him
speak
a
thousand
times
of
stages
of
leagues
he
did
not
wish
to
fall
far
short
of
his
model
d
artagnan
that
man
of
iron
who
seemed
to
be
made
of
nerve
and
muscle
only
had
struck
him
with
admiration
therefore
in
spite
of
olivain
s
remarks
he
continued
to
urge
his
steed
more
and
more
and
following
a
pleasant
little
path
leading
to
a
ferry
and
which
he
had
been
assured
shortened
the
journey
by
the
distance
of
one
league
he
arrived
at
the
summit
of
a
hill
and
perceived
the
river
flowing
before
him
a
little
troop
of
men
on
horseback
were
waiting
on
the
edge
of
the
stream
ready
to
embark
raoul
did
not
doubt
this
was
the
gentleman
and
his
escort
he
called
out
to
him
but
they
were
too
distant
to
be
heard
then
in
spite
of
the
weariness
of
his
beast
he
made
it
gallop
but
the
rising
ground
soon
deprived
him
of
all
sight
of
the
travelers
and
when
he
had
again
attained
a
new
height
the
ferryboat
had
left
the
shore
and
was
making
for
the
opposite
bank
raoul
seeing
that
he
could
not
arrive
in
time
to
cross
the
ferry
with
the
travelers
halted
to
wait
for
olivain
at
this
moment
a
shriek
was
heard
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
river
raoul
turned
toward
the
side
whence
the
cry
had
sounded
and
shaded
his
eyes
from
the
glare
of
the
setting
sun
with
his
hand
olivain
he
exclaimed
what
do
i
see
below
there
a
second
scream
more
piercing
than
the
first
now
sounded
oh
sir
cried
olivain
the
rope
which
holds
the
ferryboat
has
broken
and
the
boat
is
drifting
but
what
do
i
see
in
the
water
something
struggling
oh
yes
exclaimed
raoul
fixing
his
glance
on
one
point
in
the
stream
splendidly
illumined
by
the
setting
sun
a
horse
a
rider
they
are
sinking
cried
olivain
in
his
turn
it
was
true
and
raoul
was
convinced
that
some
accident
had
happened
and
that
a
man
was
drowning
he
gave
his
horse
its
head
struck
his
spurs
into
its
sides
and
the
animal
urged
by
pain
and
feeling
that
he
had
space
open
before
him
bounded
over
a
kind
of
paling
which
inclosed
the
landing
place
and
fell
into
the
river
scattering
to
a
distance
waves
of
white
froth
ah
sir
cried
olivain
what
are
you
doing
good
god
raoul
was
directing
his
horse
toward
the
unhappy
man
in
danger
this
was
in
fact
a
custom
familiar
to
him
having
been
brought
up
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
he
might
have
been
said
to
have
been
cradled
on
its
waves
a
hundred
times
he
had
crossed
it
on
horseback
a
thousand
times
had
swum
across
athos
foreseeing
the
period
when
he
should
make
a
soldier
of
the
viscount
had
inured
him
to
all
kinds
of
arduous
undertakings
oh
heavens
continued
olivain
in
despair
what
would
the
count
say
if
he
only
saw
you
now
the
count
would
do
as
i
do
replied
raoul
urging
his
horse
vigorously
forward
but
i
but
i
cried
olivain
pale
and
disconsolate
rushing
about
on
the
shore
how
shall
i
cross
leap
coward
cried
raoul
swimming
on
then
addressing
the
traveler
who
was
struggling
twenty
yards
in
front
of
him
courage
sir
said
he
courage
we
are
coming
to
your
olivain
advanced
retired
then
made
his
horse
rear
turned
it
and
then
struck
to
the
core
by
shame
leaped
as
raoul
had
done
only
repeating
i
am
a
dead
man
we
are
lost
in
the
meantime
the
ferryboat
had
floated
away
carried
down
by
the
stream
and
the
shrieks
of
those
whom
it
contained
resounded
more
and
more
a
man
with
gray
hair
had
thrown
himself
from
the
boat
into
the
river
and
was
swimming
vigorously
toward
the
person
who
was
drowning
but
being
obliged
to
go
against
the
current
he
advanced
but
slowly
raoul
continued
his
way
and
was
visibly
gaining
ground
but
the
horse
and
its
rider
of
whom
he
did
not
lose
sight
were
evidently
sinking
the
nostrils
of
the
horse
were
no
longer
above
water
and
the
rider
who
had
lost
the
reins
in
struggling
fell
with
his
head
back
and
his
arms
extended
one
moment
longer
and
all
would
disappear
courage
cried
raoul
courage
too
late
murmured
the
young
man
too
late
the
water
closed
above
his
head
and
stifled
his
voice
raoul
sprang
from
his
horse
to
which
he
left
the
charge
of
its
own
preservation
and
in
three
or
four
strokes
was
at
the
gentleman
s
side
he
seized
the
horse
at
once
by
the
curb
and
raised
its
head
above
water
the
animal
began
to
breathe
again
and
as
if
he
comprehended
that
they
had
come
to
his
aid
redoubled
his
efforts
raoul
at
the
same
time
seized
one
of
the
young
man
s
hands
and
placed
it
on
the
mane
which
it
grasped
with
the
tenacity
of
a
drowning
man
thus
sure
that
the
rider
would
not
release
his
hold
raoul
now
only
directed
his
attention
to
the
horse
which
he
guided
to
the
opposite
bank
helping
it
to
cut
through
the
water
and
encouraging
it
with
words
all
at
once
the
horse
stumbled
against
a
ridge
and
then
placed
its
foot
on
the
sand
saved
exclaimed
the
man
with
gray
hair
who
also
touched
bottom
saved
mechanically
repeated
the
young
gentleman
releasing
the
mane
and
sliding
from
the
saddle
into
raoul
s
arms
raoul
was
but
ten
yards
from
the
shore
there
he
bore
the
fainting
man
and
laying
him
down
upon
the
grass
unfastened
the
buttons
of
his
collar
and
unhooked
his
doublet
a
moment
later
the
man
was
beside
him
olivain
managed
in
his
turn
to
land
after
crossing
himself
repeatedly
and
the
people
in
the
ferryboat
guided
themselves
as
well
as
they
were
able
toward
the
bank
with
the
aid
of
a
pole
which
chanced
to
be
in
the
boat
thanks
to
the
attentions
of
raoul
and
the
man
who
accompanied
the
young
gentleman
the
color
gradually
returned
to
the
pale
cheeks
of
the
dying
man
who
opened
his
eyes
at
first
entirely
bewildered
but
who
soon
fixed
his
gaze
upon
the
person
who
had
saved
him
ah
sir
he
exclaimed
it
was
you
without
you
i
was
a
dead
man
thrice
but
one
recovers
sir
as
you
perceive
replied
raoul
and
we
have
but
had
a
little
oh
sir
what
gratitude
i
feel
exclaimed
the
man
with
gray
hair
ah
there
you
are
my
good
d
arminges
i
have
given
you
a
great
fright
have
i
not
but
it
is
your
own
fault
you
were
my
tutor
why
did
you
not
teach
me
to
swim
oh
monsieur
le
comte
replied
the
old
man
had
any
misfortune
happened
to
you
i
should
never
have
dared
to
show
myself
to
the
marshal
but
how
did
the
accident
happen
asked
raoul
oh
sir
in
the
most
natural
way
possible
replied
he
to
whom
they
had
given
the
title
of
count
we
were
about
a
third
of
the
way
across
the
river
when
the
cord
of
the
ferryboat
broke
alarmed
by
the
cries
and
gestures
of
the
boatmen
my
horse
sprang
into
the
water
i
can
not
swim
and
dared
not
throw
myself
into
the
river
instead
of
aiding
the
movements
of
my
horse
i
paralyzed
them
and
i
was
just
going
to
drown
myself
with
the
best
grace
in
the
world
when
you
arrived
just
in
time
to
pull
me
out
of
the
water
therefore
sir
if
you
will
agree
henceforward
we
are
friends
until
sir
replied
raoul
bowing
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
i
assure
i
am
called
the
count
de
guiche
continued
the
young
man
my
father
is
the
marechal
de
grammont
and
now
that
you
know
who
i
am
do
me
the
honor
to
inform
me
who
you
i
am
the
viscount
de
bragelonne
answered
raoul
blushing
at
being
unable
to
name
his
father
as
the
count
de
guiche
had
done
viscount
your
countenance
your
goodness
and
your
courage
incline
me
toward
you
my
gratitude
is
already
due
shake
hands
i
crave
your
sir
said
raoul
returning
the
count
s
pressure
of
the
hand
i
like
you
already
from
my
heart
pray
regard
me
as
a
devoted
friend
i
beseech
and
now
where
are
you
going
viscount
inquired
de
guiche
to
join
the
army
under
the
prince
and
i
too
exclaimed
the
young
man
in
a
transport
of
joy
oh
so
much
the
better
we
will
fire
the
first
shot
it
is
well
be
friends
said
the
tutor
young
as
you
both
are
you
were
perhaps
born
under
the
same
star
and
were
destined
to
meet
and
now
continued
he
you
must
change
your
clothes
your
servants
to
whom
i
gave
directions
the
moment
they
had
left
the
ferryboat
ought
to
be
already
at
the
inn
linen
and
wine
are
both
being
warmed
the
young
men
had
no
objection
to
this
proposition
on
the
contrary
they
thought
it
very
timely
they
mounted
again
at
once
whilst
looks
of
admiration
passed
between
them
they
were
indeed
two
elegant
horsemen
with
figures
slight
and
upright
noble
faces
bright
and
proud
looks
loyal
and
intelligent
smiles
de
guiche
might
have
been
about
eighteen
years
of
age
but
he
was
scarcely
taller
than
raoul
who
was
only
fifteen
skirmishing
the
halt
at
noyon
was
but
brief
every
one
there
being
wrapped
in
profound
sleep
raoul
had
desired
to
be
awakened
should
grimaud
arrive
but
grimaud
did
not
arrive
doubtless
too
the
horses
on
their
part
appreciated
the
eight
hours
of
repose
and
the
abundant
stabling
which
was
granted
them
the
count
de
guiche
was
awakened
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
by
raoul
who
came
to
wish
him
they
breakfasted
in
haste
and
at
six
o
clock
had
already
gone
ten
miles
the
young
count
s
conversation
was
most
interesting
to
raoul
therefore
he
listened
much
whilst
the
count
talked
well
and
long
brought
up
in
paris
where
raoul
had
been
but
once
at
the
court
which
raoul
had
never
seen
his
follies
as
page
two
duels
which
he
had
already
found
the
means
of
fighting
in
spite
of
the
edicts
against
them
and
more
especially
in
spite
of
his
tutor
s
vigilance
these
things
excited
the
greatest
curiosity
in
raoul
raoul
had
only
been
at
scarron
s
house
he
named
to
guiche
the
people
whom
he
had
seen
there
guiche
knew
everybody
madame
de
neuillan
mademoiselle
d
aubigne
mademoiselle
de
scudery
mademoiselle
paulet
madame
de
chevreuse
he
criticised
everybody
humorously
raoul
trembled
lest
he
should
laugh
among
the
rest
at
madame
de
chevreuse
for
whom
he
entertained
deep
and
genuine
sympathy
but
either
instinctively
or
from
affection
for
the
duchess
he
said
everything
in
her
favor
his
praises
increased
raoul
s
friendship
twofold
then
came
the
question
of
gallantry
and
love
affairs
under
this
head
also
bragelonne
had
much
more
to
hear
than
to
tell
he
listened
attentively
and
fancied
that
he
discovered
through
three
or
four
rather
frivolous
adventures
that
the
count
like
himself
had
a
secret
to
hide
in
the
depths
of
his
heart
de
guiche
as
we
have
said
before
had
been
educated
at
the
court
and
the
intrigues
of
this
court
were
not
unknown
to
him
it
was
the
same
court
of
which
raoul
had
so
often
heard
the
comte
de
la
fere
speak
except
that
its
aspect
had
much
changed
since
the
period
when
athos
had
himself
been
part
of
it
therefore
everything
which
the
count
de
guiche
related
was
new
to
his
traveling
companion
the
young
count
witty
and
caustic
passed
all
the
world
in
review
the
queen
herself
was
not
spared
and
cardinal
mazarin
came
in
for
his
share
of
ridicule
the
day
passed
away
as
rapidly
as
an
hour
the
count
s
tutor
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
bon
vivant
up
to
his
eyes
in
learning
as
his
pupil
described
him
often
recalled
the
profound
erudition
the
witty
and
caustic
satire
of
athos
to
raoul
but
as
regarded
grace
delicacy
and
nobility
of
external
appearance
no
one
in
these
points
was
to
be
compared
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
the
horses
which
were
more
kindly
used
than
on
the
previous
day
stopped
at
arras
at
four
o
clock
in
the
evening
they
were
approaching
the
scene
of
war
and
as
bands
of
spaniards
sometimes
took
advantage
of
the
night
to
make
expeditions
even
as
far
as
the
neighborhood
of
arras
they
determined
to
remain
in
the
town
until
the
morrow
the
french
army
held
all
between
as
far
as
valenciennes
falling
back
upon
douai
the
prince
was
said
to
be
in
person
at
bethune
the
enemy
s
army
extended
from
cassel
to
courtray
and
as
there
was
no
species
of
violence
or
pillage
it
did
not
commit
the
poor
people
on
the
frontier
quitted
their
isolated
dwellings
and
fled
for
refuge
into
the
strong
cities
which
held
out
a
shelter
to
them
arras
was
encumbered
with
fugitives
an
approaching
battle
was
much
spoken
of
the
prince
having
manoeuvred
until
that
movement
only
in
order
to
await
a
reinforcement
that
had
just
reached
him
the
young
men
congratulated
themselves
on
having
arrived
so
opportunely
the
evening
was
employed
in
discussing
the
war
the
grooms
polished
their
arms
the
young
men
loaded
the
pistols
in
case
of
a
skirmish
and
they
awoke
in
despair
having
both
dreamed
that
they
had
arrived
too
late
to
participate
in
the
battle
in
the
morning
it
was
rumored
that
prince
de
conde
had
evacuated
bethune
and
fallen
back
on
carvin
leaving
however
a
strong
garrison
in
the
former
city
but
as
there
was
nothing
positively
certain
in
this
report
the
young
warriors
decided
to
continue
their
way
toward
bethune
free
on
the
road
to
diverge
to
the
right
and
march
to
carvin
if
necessary
the
count
s
tutor
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
he
consequently
proposed
to
take
a
crossroad
which
lay
between
that
of
lens
and
that
of
bethune
they
obtained
information
at
ablain
and
a
statement
of
their
route
was
left
for
grimaud
about
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
they
set
out
de
guiche
who
was
young
and
impulsive
said
to
raoul
here
we
are
three
masters
and
three
servants
our
valets
are
well
armed
and
yours
seems
to
be
tough
i
have
never
seen
him
put
to
the
test
replied
raoul
but
he
is
a
breton
which
promises
yes
yes
resumed
de
guiche
i
am
sure
he
can
fire
a
musket
when
required
on
my
side
i
have
two
sure
men
who
have
been
in
action
with
my
father
we
therefore
represent
six
fighting
men
if
we
should
meet
a
little
troop
of
enemies
equal
or
even
superior
in
number
to
our
own
shall
we
charge
them
raoul
certainly
sir
replied
the
viscount
holloa
young
people
stop
there
said
the
tutor
joining
in
the
conversation
zounds
how
you
manoeuvre
my
instructions
count
you
seem
to
forget
the
orders
i
received
to
conduct
you
safe
and
sound
to
his
highness
the
prince
once
with
the
army
you
may
be
killed
at
your
good
pleasure
but
until
that
time
i
warn
you
that
in
my
capacity
of
general
of
the
army
i
shall
order
a
retreat
and
turn
my
back
on
the
first
red
coat
we
come
de
guiche
and
raoul
glanced
at
each
other
smiling
they
arrived
at
ablain
without
accident
there
they
inquired
and
learned
that
the
prince
had
in
reality
quitted
bethune
and
stationed
himself
between
cambria
and
la
venthie
therefore
leaving
directions
at
every
place
for
grimaud
they
took
a
crossroad
which
conducted
the
little
troop
by
the
bank
of
a
small
stream
flowing
into
the
lys
the
country
was
beautiful
intersected
by
valleys
as
green
as
the
emerald
here
and
there
they
passed
little
copses
crossing
the
path
which
they
were
following
in
anticipation
of
some
ambuscade
in
each
of
these
little
woods
the
tutor
placed
his
two
servants
at
the
head
of
the
band
thus
forming
the
advance
guard
himself
and
the
two
young
men
represented
the
body
of
the
army
whilst
olivain
with
his
rifle
upon
his
knee
and
his
eyes
upon
the
watch
protected
the
rear
they
had
observed
for
some
time
before
them
on
the
horizon
a
rather
thick
wood
and
when
they
had
arrived
at
a
distance
of
a
hundred
steps
from
it
monsieur
d
arminges
took
his
usual
precautions
and
sent
on
in
advance
the
count
s
two
grooms
the
servants
had
just
disappeared
under
the
trees
followed
by
the
tutor
and
the
young
men
were
laughing
and
talking
about
a
hundred
yards
off
olivain
was
at
the
same
distance
in
the
rear
when
suddenly
there
resounded
five
or
six
the
tutor
cried
halt
the
young
men
obeyed
pulling
up
their
steeds
and
at
the
same
moment
the
two
valets
were
seen
returning
at
a
gallop
the
young
men
impatient
to
learn
the
cause
of
the
firing
spurred
on
toward
the
servants
the
tutor
followed
them
were
you
stopped
eagerly
inquired
the
two
youths
no
replied
the
servants
it
is
even
probable
that
we
have
not
been
seen
the
shots
were
fired
about
a
hundred
paces
in
advance
of
us
in
the
thickest
part
of
the
wood
and
we
returned
to
ask
your
my
advice
is
this
said
monsieur
d
arminges
and
if
needs
be
my
will
that
we
beat
a
retreat
there
may
be
an
ambuscade
concealed
in
this
did
you
see
nothing
there
asked
the
count
i
thought
i
saw
said
one
of
the
servants
horsemen
dressed
in
yellow
creeping
along
the
bed
of
the
stream
that
s
it
said
the
tutor
we
have
fallen
in
with
a
party
of
spaniards
come
back
sirs
the
two
youths
looked
at
each
other
and
at
this
moment
a
and
cries
for
help
were
heard
another
glance
between
the
young
men
convinced
them
both
that
neither
had
any
wish
to
go
back
and
as
the
tutor
had
already
turned
his
horse
s
head
they
both
spurred
forward
raoul
crying
follow
me
olivain
and
the
count
de
guiche
follow
urban
and
planchet
and
before
the
tutor
could
recover
from
his
surprise
they
had
both
disappeared
into
the
forest
whilst
they
spurred
their
steeds
they
held
their
pistols
ready
also
in
five
minutes
they
arrived
at
the
spot
whence
the
noise
had
proceeded
and
then
restraining
their
horses
they
advanced
cautiously
hush
whispered
de
guiche
these
are
yes
three
on
horseback
and
three
who
have
can
you
see
what
they
are
doing
yes
they
appear
to
be
searching
a
wounded
or
dead
it
is
some
cowardly
assassination
said
de
guiche
they
are
soldiers
though
resumed
de
bragelonne
yes
skirmishers
that
is
to
say
highway
at
them
cried
raoul
at
them
echoed
de
guiche
oh
gentlemen
gentlemen
in
the
name
of
heaven
cried
the
poor
tutor
but
he
was
not
listened
to
and
his
cries
only
served
to
arouse
the
attention
of
the
spaniards
the
men
on
horseback
at
once
rushed
at
the
two
youths
leaving
the
three
others
to
complete
the
plunder
of
the
dead
or
wounded
travelers
for
on
approaching
nearer
instead
of
one
extended
figure
the
young
men
discovered
two
de
guiche
fired
the
first
shot
at
ten
paces
and
missed
his
man
and
the
spaniard
who
had
advanced
to
meet
raoul
aimed
in
his
turn
and
raoul
felt
a
pain
in
the
left
arm
similar
to
that
of
a
blow
from
a
whip
he
let
off
his
fire
at
but
four
paces
struck
in
the
breast
and
extending
his
arms
the
spaniard
fell
back
on
the
crupper
and
the
terrified
horse
turning
around
carried
him
off
raoul
at
this
moment
perceived
the
muzzle
of
a
gun
pointed
at
him
and
remembering
the
recommendation
of
athos
he
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
made
his
horse
rear
as
the
shot
was
fired
his
horse
bounded
to
one
side
losing
its
footing
and
fell
entangling
raoul
s
leg
under
its
body
the
spaniard
sprang
forward
and
seized
the
gun
by
its
muzzle
in
order
to
strike
raoul
on
the
head
with
the
butt
in
the
position
in
which
raoul
lay
unfortunately
he
could
neither
draw
his
sword
from
the
scabbard
nor
his
pistols
from
their
holsters
the
butt
end
of
the
musket
hovered
over
his
head
and
he
could
scarcely
restrain
himself
from
closing
his
eyes
when
with
one
bound
guiche
reached
the
spaniard
and
placed
a
pistol
at
his
throat
yield
he
cried
or
you
are
a
dead
man
the
musket
fell
from
the
soldier
s
hands
who
yielded
on
the
instant
guiche
summoned
one
of
his
grooms
and
delivering
the
prisoner
into
his
charge
with
orders
to
shoot
him
through
the
head
if
he
attempted
to
escape
he
leaped
from
his
horse
and
approached
raoul
faith
sir
said
raoul
smiling
although
his
pallor
betrayed
the
excitement
consequent
on
a
first
affair
you
are
in
a
great
hurry
to
pay
your
debts
and
have
not
been
long
under
any
obligation
to
me
without
your
aid
continued
he
repeating
the
count
s
words
i
should
have
been
a
dead
man
thrice
my
antagonist
took
flight
replied
de
guiche
and
left
me
at
liberty
to
come
to
your
assistance
but
are
you
seriously
wounded
i
see
you
are
covered
with
blood
i
believe
said
raoul
that
i
have
got
something
like
a
scratch
on
the
arm
if
you
will
help
me
to
drag
myself
from
under
my
horse
i
hope
nothing
need
prevent
us
continuing
our
monsieur
d
arminges
and
olivain
had
already
dismounted
and
were
attempting
to
raise
the
struggling
horse
at
last
raoul
succeeded
in
drawing
his
foot
from
the
stirrup
and
his
leg
from
under
the
animal
and
in
a
second
he
was
on
his
feet
again
nothing
broken
asked
de
guiche
faith
no
thank
heaven
replied
raoul
but
what
has
become
of
the
poor
wretches
whom
these
scoundrels
were
murdering
i
fear
we
arrived
too
late
they
have
killed
them
i
think
and
taken
flight
carrying
off
their
booty
my
servants
are
examining
the
let
us
go
and
see
whether
they
are
quite
dead
or
if
they
can
still
be
helped
suggested
raoul
olivain
we
have
come
into
possession
of
two
horses
but
i
have
lost
my
own
take
for
yourself
the
better
of
the
two
and
give
me
they
approached
the
spot
where
the
unfortunate
victims
lay
the
monk
two
men
lay
prone
upon
the
ground
one
bathed
in
blood
and
motionless
with
his
face
toward
the
earth
this
one
was
dead
the
other
leaned
against
a
tree
supported
there
by
the
two
valets
and
was
praying
fervently
with
clasped
hands
and
eyes
raised
to
heaven
he
had
received
a
ball
in
his
thigh
which
had
broken
the
bone
the
young
men
first
approached
the
dead
man
he
is
a
priest
said
bragelonne
he
has
worn
the
tonsure
oh
the
scoundrels
to
lift
their
hands
against
a
minister
of
come
here
sir
said
urban
an
old
soldier
who
had
served
under
the
cardinal
duke
in
all
his
campaigns
come
here
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
with
him
whilst
we
may
perhaps
be
able
to
save
the
the
wounded
man
smiled
sadly
save
me
oh
no
said
he
but
help
me
to
die
if
you
are
you
a
priest
asked
raoul
no
i
ask
as
your
unfortunate
companion
appeared
to
me
to
belong
to
the
he
is
the
curate
of
bethune
sir
and
was
carrying
the
holy
vessels
belonging
to
his
church
and
the
treasure
of
the
chapter
to
a
safe
place
the
prince
having
abandoned
our
town
yesterday
and
as
it
was
known
that
bands
of
the
enemy
were
prowling
about
the
country
no
one
dared
to
accompany
the
good
man
so
i
offered
to
do
so
and
sir
continued
the
wounded
man
i
suffer
much
and
would
like
if
possible
to
be
carried
to
some
where
you
can
be
relieved
asked
de
guiche
no
where
i
can
but
perhaps
you
are
not
so
dangerously
wounded
as
you
think
said
raoul
sir
replied
the
wounded
man
believe
me
there
is
no
time
to
lose
the
ball
has
broken
the
thigh
bone
and
entered
the
are
you
a
surgeon
asked
de
guiche
no
but
i
know
a
little
about
wounds
and
mine
i
know
is
mortal
try
therefore
either
to
carry
me
to
some
place
where
i
may
see
a
priest
or
take
the
trouble
to
send
one
to
me
here
it
is
my
soul
that
must
be
saved
as
for
my
body
it
is
to
die
whilst
doing
a
good
deed
it
is
impossible
god
will
help
gentlemen
in
the
name
of
heaven
said
the
wounded
man
collecting
all
his
forces
as
if
to
get
up
let
us
not
lose
time
in
useless
words
either
help
me
to
gain
the
nearest
village
or
swear
to
me
on
your
salvation
that
you
will
send
me
the
first
monk
the
first
cure
the
first
priest
you
may
meet
but
he
added
in
a
despairing
tone
perhaps
no
one
will
dare
to
come
for
it
is
known
that
the
spaniards
are
ranging
through
the
country
and
i
shall
die
without
absolution
my
god
my
god
good
god
good
god
added
the
wounded
man
in
an
accent
of
terror
which
made
the
young
men
shudder
you
will
not
allow
that
that
would
be
too
terrible
calm
yourself
sir
replied
de
guiche
i
swear
to
you
you
shall
receive
the
consolation
that
you
ask
only
tell
us
where
we
shall
find
a
house
at
which
we
can
demand
aid
and
a
village
from
which
we
can
fetch
a
thank
you
and
god
reward
you
about
half
a
mile
from
this
on
the
same
road
there
is
an
inn
and
about
a
mile
further
on
after
leaving
the
inn
you
will
reach
the
village
of
greney
there
you
must
find
the
curate
or
if
he
is
not
at
home
go
to
the
convent
of
the
augustines
which
is
the
last
house
on
the
right
and
bring
me
one
of
the
brothers
monk
or
priest
it
matters
not
provided
only
that
he
has
received
from
holy
church
the
power
of
absolving
in
articulo
monsieur
d
arminges
said
de
guiche
remain
beside
this
unfortunate
man
and
see
that
he
is
removed
as
gently
as
possible
the
vicomte
and
myself
will
go
and
find
a
go
sir
replied
the
tutor
but
in
heaven
s
name
do
not
expose
yourself
to
danger
do
not
fear
besides
we
are
safe
for
you
know
the
axiom
non
bis
in
courage
sir
said
raoul
to
the
wounded
man
we
are
going
to
execute
your
may
heaven
prosper
you
replied
the
dying
man
with
an
accent
of
gratitude
impossible
to
describe
the
two
young
men
galloped
off
in
the
direction
mentioned
and
in
ten
minutes
reached
the
inn
raoul
without
dismounting
called
to
the
host
and
announced
that
a
wounded
man
was
about
to
be
brought
to
his
house
and
begged
him
in
the
meantime
to
prepare
everything
needful
he
desired
him
also
should
he
know
in
the
neighborhood
any
doctor
or
chirurgeon
to
fetch
him
taking
on
himself
the
payment
of
the
messenger
the
host
who
saw
two
young
noblemen
richly
clad
promised
everything
they
required
and
our
two
cavaliers
after
seeing
that
preparations
for
the
reception
were
actually
begun
started
off
again
and
proceeded
rapidly
toward
greney
they
had
gone
rather
more
than
a
league
and
had
begun
to
descry
the
first
houses
of
the
village
the
roofs
of
which
stood
out
from
the
green
trees
which
surrounded
them
when
coming
toward
them
mounted
on
a
mule
they
perceived
a
poor
monk
whose
large
hat
and
gray
worsted
dress
made
them
take
him
for
an
augustine
brother
chance
for
once
seemed
to
favor
them
in
sending
what
they
were
so
assiduously
seeking
he
was
a
man
about
or
years
old
but
who
appeared
much
older
from
ascetic
exercises
his
complexion
was
pale
not
of
that
deadly
pallor
which
is
a
kind
of
neutral
beauty
but
of
a
bilious
yellow
hue
his
colorless
hair
was
short
and
scarcely
extended
beyond
the
circle
formed
by
the
hat
around
his
head
and
his
light
blue
eyes
seemed
destitute
of
any
expression
sir
began
raoul
with
his
usual
politeness
are
you
an
ecclesiastic
why
do
you
ask
me
that
replied
the
stranger
with
a
coolness
which
was
barely
civil
because
we
want
to
know
said
de
guiche
haughtily
the
stranger
touched
his
mule
with
his
heel
and
continued
his
way
in
a
second
de
guiche
had
sprung
before
him
and
barred
his
passage
answer
sir
exclaimed
he
you
have
been
asked
politely
and
every
question
is
worth
an
i
suppose
i
am
free
to
say
or
not
to
say
who
i
am
to
two
strangers
who
take
a
fancy
to
ask
it
was
with
difficulty
that
de
guiche
restrained
the
intense
desire
he
had
of
breaking
the
monk
s
bones
in
the
first
place
he
said
making
an
effort
to
control
himself
we
are
not
people
who
may
be
treated
anyhow
my
friend
there
is
the
viscount
of
bragelonne
and
i
am
the
count
de
guiche
nor
was
it
from
caprice
we
asked
the
question
for
there
is
a
wounded
and
dying
man
who
demands
the
succor
of
the
church
if
you
be
a
priest
i
conjure
you
in
the
name
of
humanity
to
follow
me
to
aid
this
man
if
you
be
not
it
is
a
different
matter
and
i
warn
you
in
the
name
of
courtesy
of
which
you
appear
profoundly
ignorant
that
i
shall
chastise
you
for
your
the
pale
face
of
the
monk
became
so
livid
and
his
smile
so
strange
that
raoul
whose
eyes
were
still
fixed
upon
him
felt
as
if
this
smile
had
struck
to
his
heart
like
an
insult
he
is
some
spanish
or
flemish
spy
said
he
putting
his
hand
to
his
pistol
a
glance
threatening
and
transient
as
lightning
replied
to
raoul
well
sir
said
de
guiche
are
you
going
to
reply
i
am
a
priest
said
the
young
man
then
father
said
raoul
forcing
himself
to
convey
a
respect
by
speech
that
did
not
come
from
his
heart
if
you
are
a
priest
you
have
an
opportunity
as
my
friend
has
told
you
of
exercising
your
vocation
at
the
next
inn
you
will
find
a
wounded
man
now
being
attended
by
our
servants
who
has
asked
the
assistance
of
a
minister
of
i
will
go
said
the
monk
and
he
touched
his
mule
if
you
do
not
go
sir
said
de
guiche
remember
that
we
have
two
steeds
able
to
catch
your
mule
and
the
power
of
having
you
seized
wherever
you
may
be
and
then
i
swear
your
trial
will
be
summary
one
can
always
find
a
tree
and
a
the
monk
s
eye
again
flashed
but
that
was
all
he
merely
repeated
his
phrase
i
will
go
and
he
went
let
us
follow
him
said
de
guiche
it
will
be
the
surest
i
was
about
to
propose
so
doing
answered
de
bragelonne
in
the
space
of
five
minutes
the
monk
turned
around
to
ascertain
whether
he
was
followed
or
not
you
see
said
raoul
we
have
done
what
a
horrible
face
that
monk
has
said
de
guiche
horrible
replied
raoul
especially
in
yes
yes
said
de
guiche
a
strange
face
but
these
monks
are
subject
to
such
degrading
practices
their
fasts
make
them
pale
the
blows
of
the
discipline
make
them
hypocrites
and
their
eyes
become
inflamed
through
weeping
for
the
good
things
of
this
life
we
common
folk
enjoy
but
they
have
well
said
raoul
the
poor
man
will
get
his
priest
but
by
heaven
the
penitent
appears
to
me
to
have
a
better
conscience
than
the
confessor
i
confess
i
am
accustomed
to
priests
of
a
very
different
ah
exclaimed
de
guiche
you
must
understand
that
this
is
one
of
those
wandering
brothers
who
go
begging
on
the
high
road
until
some
day
a
benefice
falls
down
from
heaven
on
them
they
are
mostly
foreigners
scotch
irish
or
danish
i
have
seen
them
as
ugly
no
but
reasonably
what
a
misfortune
for
the
wounded
man
to
die
under
the
hands
of
such
a
friar
pshaw
said
de
guiche
absolution
comes
not
from
him
who
administers
it
but
from
god
however
for
my
part
i
would
rather
die
unshriven
than
have
anything
to
say
to
such
a
confessor
you
are
of
my
opinion
are
you
not
viscount
and
i
see
you
playing
with
the
pommel
of
your
sword
as
if
you
had
a
great
inclination
to
break
the
holy
father
s
yes
count
it
is
a
strange
thing
and
one
which
might
astonish
you
but
i
feel
an
indescribable
horror
at
the
sight
of
yonder
man
have
you
ever
seen
a
snake
rise
up
on
your
path
never
answered
de
guiche
well
it
has
happened
to
me
to
do
so
in
our
blaisois
forests
and
i
remember
that
the
first
time
i
encountered
one
with
its
eyes
fixed
upon
me
curled
up
swinging
its
head
and
pointing
its
tongue
i
remained
fixed
pale
and
as
though
fascinated
until
the
moment
when
the
comte
de
la
fere
your
father
asked
de
guiche
no
my
guardian
replied
raoul
blushing
very
well
until
the
moment
when
the
comte
de
la
fere
resumed
raoul
said
come
bragelonne
draw
your
sword
then
only
i
rushed
upon
the
reptile
and
cut
it
in
two
just
at
the
moment
when
it
was
rising
on
its
tail
and
hissing
ere
it
sprang
upon
me
well
i
vow
i
felt
exactly
the
same
sensation
at
sight
of
that
man
when
he
said
why
do
you
ask
me
that
and
looked
so
strangely
at
then
you
regret
that
you
did
not
cut
your
serpent
in
two
morsels
faith
yes
almost
said
raoul
they
had
now
arrived
within
sight
of
the
little
inn
and
could
see
on
the
opposite
side
the
procession
bearing
the
wounded
man
and
guided
by
monsieur
d
arminges
the
youths
spurred
on
there
is
the
wounded
man
said
de
guiche
passing
close
to
the
augustine
brother
be
good
enough
to
hurry
yourself
a
little
monsieur
as
for
raoul
he
avoided
the
monk
by
the
whole
width
of
the
road
and
passed
him
turning
his
head
away
in
repulsion
the
young
men
rode
up
to
the
wounded
man
to
announce
that
they
were
followed
by
the
priest
he
raised
himself
to
glance
in
the
direction
which
they
pointed
out
saw
the
monk
and
fell
back
upon
the
litter
his
face
illumined
by
joy
and
now
said
the
youths
we
have
done
all
we
can
for
you
and
as
we
are
in
haste
to
rejoin
the
prince
s
army
we
must
continue
our
journey
you
will
excuse
us
sir
but
we
are
told
that
a
battle
is
expected
and
we
do
not
wish
to
arrive
the
day
after
go
my
young
sirs
said
the
sick
man
and
may
you
both
be
blessed
for
your
piety
you
have
done
for
me
as
you
promised
all
that
you
could
do
as
for
me
i
can
only
repeat
may
god
protect
you
and
all
dear
to
you
sir
said
de
guiche
to
his
tutor
we
will
precede
you
and
you
can
rejoin
us
on
the
road
to
the
host
was
at
his
door
and
everything
was
prepared
bed
bandages
and
lint
and
a
groom
had
gone
to
lens
the
nearest
village
for
a
doctor
everything
said
he
to
raoul
shall
be
done
as
you
desire
but
you
will
not
stop
to
have
your
wound
dressed
oh
my
wound
mine
tis
nothing
replied
the
viscount
it
will
be
time
to
think
about
it
when
we
next
halt
only
have
the
goodness
should
you
see
a
cavalier
who
makes
inquiries
about
a
young
man
on
a
chestnut
horse
followed
by
a
servant
to
tell
him
in
fact
that
you
have
seen
me
but
that
i
have
continued
my
journey
and
intend
to
dine
at
mazingarbe
and
to
stop
at
cambrin
this
cavalier
is
my
would
it
not
be
safer
and
more
certain
if
i
should
ask
him
his
name
and
tell
him
yours
demanded
the
host
there
is
no
harm
in
i
am
the
viscount
de
bragelonne
and
he
is
called
at
this
moment
the
wounded
man
arrived
from
one
direction
and
the
monk
from
the
other
the
latter
dismounting
from
his
mule
and
desiring
that
it
should
be
taken
to
the
stables
without
being
unharnessed
sir
monk
said
de
guiche
confess
well
that
brave
man
and
be
not
concerned
for
your
expenses
or
for
those
of
your
mule
all
is
thanks
monsieur
said
the
monk
with
one
of
those
smiles
that
made
bragelonne
shudder
come
count
said
raoul
who
seemed
instinctively
to
dislike
the
vicinity
of
the
augustine
come
i
feel
ill
here
and
the
two
young
men
spurred
on
the
litter
borne
by
two
servants
now
entered
the
house
the
host
and
his
wife
were
standing
on
the
steps
whilst
the
unhappy
man
seemed
to
suffer
dreadful
pain
and
yet
to
be
concerned
only
to
know
if
he
was
followed
by
the
monk
at
sight
of
this
pale
bleeding
man
the
wife
grasped
her
husband
s
arm
well
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
latter
are
you
going
to
be
ill
just
now
no
but
look
replied
the
hostess
pointing
to
the
wounded
man
i
ask
you
if
you
recognize
him
that
man
wait
a
ah
i
see
you
know
him
exclaimed
the
wife
for
you
have
become
pale
in
your
truly
cried
the
host
misfortune
is
coming
on
our
house
it
is
the
former
executioner
of
the
former
executioner
of
bethune
murmured
the
young
monk
shrinking
back
and
showing
on
his
countenance
the
feeling
of
repugnance
which
his
penitent
inspired
monsieur
d
arminges
who
was
at
the
door
perceived
his
hesitation
sir
monk
said
he
whether
he
is
now
or
has
been
an
executioner
this
unfortunate
being
is
none
the
less
a
man
render
to
him
then
the
last
service
he
can
by
any
possibility
ask
of
you
and
your
work
will
be
all
the
more
the
monk
made
no
reply
but
silently
wended
his
way
to
the
room
where
the
two
valets
had
deposited
the
dying
man
on
a
bed
d
arminges
and
olivain
and
the
two
grooms
then
mounted
their
horses
and
all
four
started
off
at
a
quick
trot
to
rejoin
raoul
and
his
companion
just
as
the
tutor
and
his
escort
disappeared
in
their
turn
a
new
traveler
stopped
on
the
threshold
of
the
inn
what
does
your
worship
want
demanded
the
host
pale
and
trembling
from
the
discovery
he
had
just
made
the
traveler
made
a
sign
as
if
he
wished
to
drink
and
then
pointed
to
his
horse
and
gesticulated
like
a
man
who
is
brushing
something
ah
diable
said
the
host
to
himself
this
man
seems
dumb
and
where
will
your
worship
drink
there
answered
the
traveler
pointing
to
the
table
i
was
mistaken
said
the
host
he
s
not
quite
dumb
and
what
else
does
your
worship
wish
for
to
know
if
you
have
seen
a
young
man
pass
fifteen
years
of
age
mounted
on
a
chestnut
horse
and
followed
by
a
groom
the
viscount
de
bragelonne
just
then
you
are
called
monsieur
grimaud
the
traveler
made
a
sign
of
assent
well
then
said
the
host
your
young
master
was
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
he
will
dine
at
mazingarbe
and
sleep
at
how
far
is
mazingarbe
two
miles
and
a
thank
grimaud
was
drinking
his
wine
silently
and
had
just
placed
his
glass
on
the
table
to
be
filled
a
second
time
when
a
terrific
scream
resounded
from
the
room
occupied
by
the
monk
and
the
dying
man
grimaud
sprang
up
what
is
that
said
he
whence
comes
that
cry
from
the
wounded
man
s
room
replied
the
host
what
wounded
man
the
former
executioner
of
bethune
who
has
just
been
brought
in
here
assassinated
by
spaniards
and
who
is
now
being
confessed
by
an
augustine
the
old
executioner
of
bethune
muttered
grimaud
a
man
between
and
sixty
tall
strong
swarthy
black
hair
and
beard
that
is
he
except
that
his
beard
has
turned
gray
and
his
hair
is
white
do
you
know
him
asked
the
host
i
have
seen
him
once
replied
grimaud
a
cloud
darkening
his
countenance
at
the
picture
so
suddenly
summoned
to
the
bar
of
recollection
at
this
instant
a
second
cry
less
piercing
than
the
first
but
followed
by
prolonged
groaning
was
heard
the
three
listeners
looked
at
one
another
in
alarm
we
must
see
what
it
is
said
grimaud
it
sounds
like
the
cry
of
one
who
is
being
murdered
murmured
the
host
mon
dieu
said
the
woman
crossing
herself
if
grimaud
was
slow
in
speaking
we
know
that
he
was
quick
to
act
he
sprang
to
the
door
and
shook
it
violently
but
it
was
bolted
on
the
other
side
open
the
door
cried
the
host
open
it
instantly
sir
monk
no
reply
unfasten
it
or
i
will
break
it
in
said
grimaud
the
same
silence
and
then
ere
the
host
could
oppose
his
design
grimaud
seized
a
pair
of
pincers
he
perceived
in
a
corner
and
forced
the
bolt
the
room
was
inundated
with
blood
dripping
from
the
mattresses
upon
which
lay
the
wounded
man
speechless
the
monk
had
disappeared
the
monk
cried
the
host
where
is
the
monk
grimaud
sprang
toward
an
open
window
which
looked
into
the
courtyard
he
has
escaped
by
this
means
exclaimed
he
do
you
think
so
said
the
host
bewildered
boy
see
if
the
mule
belonging
to
the
monk
is
still
in
the
there
is
no
mule
cried
he
to
whom
this
question
was
addressed
the
host
clasped
his
hands
and
looked
around
him
suspiciously
whilst
grimaud
knit
his
brows
and
approached
the
wounded
man
whose
worn
hard
features
awoke
in
his
mind
such
awful
recollections
of
the
past
there
can
be
no
longer
any
doubt
but
that
it
is
himself
said
he
does
he
still
live
inquired
the
innkeeper
making
no
reply
grimaud
opened
the
poor
man
s
jacket
to
feel
if
the
heart
beat
whilst
the
host
approached
in
his
turn
but
in
a
moment
they
both
fell
back
the
host
uttering
a
cry
of
horror
and
grimaud
becoming
pallid
the
blade
of
a
dagger
was
buried
up
to
the
hilt
in
the
left
side
of
the
executioner
run
run
for
help
cried
grimaud
and
i
will
remain
beside
him
the
host
quitted
the
room
in
agitation
and
as
for
his
wife
she
had
fled
at
the
sound
of
her
husband
s
cries
the
absolution
this
is
what
had
taken
place
we
have
seen
that
it
was
not
of
his
own
free
will
but
on
the
contrary
very
reluctantly
that
the
monk
attended
the
wounded
man
who
had
been
recommended
to
him
in
so
strange
a
manner
perhaps
he
would
have
sought
to
escape
by
flight
had
he
seen
any
possibility
of
doing
so
he
was
restrained
by
the
threats
of
the
two
gentlemen
and
by
the
presence
of
their
attendants
who
doubtless
had
received
their
instructions
and
besides
he
considered
it
most
expedient
without
exhibiting
too
much
to
follow
to
the
end
his
role
as
confessor
the
monk
entered
the
chamber
and
approached
the
bed
of
the
wounded
man
the
executioner
searched
his
face
with
the
quick
glance
peculiar
to
those
who
are
about
to
die
and
have
no
time
to
lose
he
made
a
movement
of
surprise
and
said
father
you
are
very
men
who
bear
my
robe
have
no
age
replied
the
monk
dryly
alas
speak
to
me
more
gently
father
in
my
last
moments
i
need
a
do
you
suffer
much
asked
the
monk
yes
but
in
my
soul
much
more
than
in
my
we
will
save
your
soul
said
the
young
man
but
are
you
really
the
executioner
of
bethune
as
these
people
say
that
is
to
say
eagerly
replied
the
wounded
man
who
doubtless
feared
that
the
name
of
executioner
would
take
from
him
the
last
help
that
he
could
claim
that
is
to
say
i
was
but
am
no
longer
it
is
fifteen
years
since
i
gave
up
the
office
i
still
assist
at
executions
but
no
longer
strike
the
blow
myself
no
you
have
then
a
repugnance
to
your
profession
so
long
as
i
struck
in
the
name
of
the
law
and
of
justice
my
profession
allowed
me
to
sleep
quietly
sheltered
as
i
was
by
justice
and
law
but
since
that
terrible
night
when
i
became
an
instrument
of
private
vengeance
and
when
with
personal
hatred
i
raised
the
sword
over
one
of
god
s
creatures
since
that
day
the
executioner
paused
and
shook
his
head
with
an
expression
of
despair
tell
me
about
it
said
the
monk
who
sitting
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
began
to
be
interested
in
a
story
so
strangely
introduced
ah
cried
the
dying
man
with
all
the
effusiveness
of
a
grief
declared
after
long
suppression
ah
i
have
sought
to
stifle
remorse
by
twenty
years
of
good
deeds
i
have
assuaged
the
natural
ferocity
of
those
who
shed
blood
on
every
occasion
i
have
exposed
my
life
to
save
those
who
were
in
danger
and
i
have
preserved
lives
in
exchange
for
that
i
took
away
that
is
not
all
the
money
gained
in
the
exercise
of
my
profession
i
have
distributed
to
the
poor
i
have
been
assiduous
in
attending
church
and
those
who
formerly
fled
from
me
have
become
accustomed
to
seeing
me
all
have
forgiven
me
some
have
even
loved
me
but
i
think
that
god
has
not
pardoned
me
for
the
memory
of
that
execution
pursues
me
constantly
and
every
night
i
see
that
woman
s
ghost
rising
before
a
woman
you
have
assassinated
a
woman
then
cried
the
monk
you
also
exclaimed
the
executioner
you
use
that
word
which
sounds
ever
in
my
ears
assassinated
i
have
assassinated
then
and
not
executed
i
am
an
assassin
then
and
not
an
officer
of
justice
and
he
closed
his
eyes
with
a
groan
the
monk
doubtless
feared
that
he
would
die
without
saying
more
for
he
exclaimed
eagerly
go
on
i
know
nothing
as
yet
when
you
have
finished
your
story
god
and
i
will
oh
father
continued
the
executioner
without
opening
his
eyes
as
if
he
feared
on
opening
them
to
see
some
frightful
object
it
is
especially
when
night
comes
on
and
when
i
have
to
cross
a
river
that
this
terror
which
i
have
been
unable
to
conquer
comes
upon
me
it
then
seems
as
if
my
hand
grew
heavy
as
if
the
cutlass
was
still
in
its
grasp
as
if
the
water
had
the
color
of
blood
and
all
the
voices
of
nature
the
whispering
of
the
trees
the
murmur
of
the
wind
the
lapping
of
the
wave
united
in
a
voice
tearful
despairing
terrible
crying
to
me
place
for
the
justice
of
god
delirium
murmured
the
monk
shaking
his
head
the
executioner
opened
his
eyes
turned
toward
the
young
man
and
grasped
his
arm
delirium
he
repeated
delirium
do
you
say
oh
no
i
remember
too
well
it
was
evening
i
had
thrown
the
body
into
the
river
and
those
words
which
my
remorse
repeats
to
me
are
those
which
i
in
my
pride
pronounced
after
being
the
instrument
of
human
justice
i
aspired
to
be
that
of
the
justice
of
but
let
me
see
how
was
it
done
speak
said
the
monk
it
was
at
night
a
man
came
to
me
and
showed
me
an
order
and
i
followed
him
four
other
noblemen
awaited
me
they
led
me
away
masked
i
reserved
the
right
of
refusing
if
the
office
they
required
of
me
should
seem
unjust
we
traveled
five
or
six
leagues
serious
silent
and
almost
without
speaking
at
length
through
the
window
of
a
little
hut
they
showed
me
a
woman
sitting
leaning
on
a
table
and
said
there
is
the
person
to
be
horrible
said
the
monk
and
you
obeyed
father
that
woman
was
a
monster
it
was
said
that
she
had
poisoned
her
second
husband
she
had
tried
to
assassinate
her
she
had
just
poisoned
a
young
woman
who
was
her
rival
and
before
leaving
england
she
had
it
was
believed
caused
the
favorite
of
the
king
to
be
buckingham
cried
the
monk
yes
the
woman
was
english
then
no
she
was
french
but
she
had
married
in
the
monk
turned
pale
wiped
his
brow
and
went
and
bolted
the
door
the
executioner
thought
that
he
had
abandoned
him
and
fell
back
groaning
upon
his
bed
no
no
i
am
here
said
the
monk
quickly
coming
back
to
him
go
on
who
were
those
men
one
of
them
was
a
foreigner
english
i
think
the
four
others
were
french
and
wore
the
uniform
of
their
names
asked
the
monk
i
don
t
know
them
but
the
four
other
noblemen
called
the
englishman
my
was
the
woman
handsome
young
and
beautiful
oh
yes
especially
beautiful
i
see
her
now
as
on
her
knees
at
my
feet
with
her
head
thrown
back
she
begged
for
life
i
have
never
understood
how
i
could
have
laid
low
a
head
so
beautiful
with
a
face
so
the
monk
seemed
agitated
by
a
strange
emotion
he
trembled
all
over
he
seemed
eager
to
put
a
question
which
yet
he
dared
not
ask
at
length
with
a
violent
effort
at
the
name
of
that
woman
he
said
i
don
t
know
what
it
was
as
i
have
said
she
was
twice
married
once
in
france
the
second
time
in
she
was
young
you
say
years
beautiful
blond
abundance
of
hair
falling
over
her
shoulders
eyes
of
an
admirable
expression
when
she
chose
oh
yes
it
is
she
a
voice
of
strange
sweetness
how
do
you
know
it
the
executioner
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
and
gazed
with
a
frightened
air
at
the
monk
who
became
livid
and
you
killed
her
the
monk
exclaimed
you
were
the
tool
of
those
cowards
who
dared
not
kill
her
themselves
you
had
no
pity
for
that
youthfulness
that
beauty
that
weakness
you
killed
that
woman
alas
i
have
already
told
you
father
that
woman
under
that
angelic
appearance
had
an
infernal
soul
and
when
i
saw
her
when
i
recalled
all
the
evil
she
had
done
to
me
to
you
what
could
she
have
done
to
you
come
tell
me
she
had
seduced
and
ruined
my
brother
a
priest
she
had
fled
with
him
from
her
with
your
brother
yes
my
brother
was
her
first
lover
and
she
caused
his
death
oh
father
do
not
look
in
that
way
at
me
oh
i
am
guilty
then
you
will
not
pardon
me
the
monk
recovered
his
usual
expression
yes
yes
he
said
i
will
pardon
you
if
you
tell
me
oh
cried
the
executioner
all
all
all
answer
then
if
she
seduced
your
brother
you
said
she
seduced
him
did
you
not
if
she
caused
his
death
you
said
that
she
caused
his
death
yes
repeated
the
executioner
then
you
must
know
what
her
name
was
as
a
young
oh
mon
dieu
cried
the
executioner
i
think
i
am
dying
absolution
father
tell
me
her
name
and
i
will
give
her
name
was
my
god
have
pity
on
me
murmured
the
executioner
and
he
fell
back
on
the
bed
pale
trembling
and
apparently
about
to
die
her
name
repeated
the
monk
bending
over
him
as
if
to
tear
from
him
the
name
if
he
would
not
utter
it
her
name
speak
or
no
absolution
the
dying
man
collected
all
his
forces
the
monk
s
eyes
glittered
anne
de
bueil
murmured
the
wounded
man
anne
de
bueil
cried
the
monk
standing
up
and
lifting
his
hands
to
heaven
anne
de
bueil
you
said
anne
de
bueil
did
you
not
yes
yes
that
was
her
name
and
now
absolve
me
for
i
am
i
absolve
you
cried
the
priest
with
a
laugh
which
made
the
dying
man
s
hair
stand
on
end
i
absolve
you
i
am
not
a
you
are
not
a
priest
cried
the
executioner
what
then
are
you
i
am
about
to
tell
you
wretched
oh
mon
dieu
i
am
john
francis
de
i
do
not
know
you
said
the
executioner
wait
wait
you
are
going
to
know
me
i
am
john
francis
de
winter
he
repeated
and
that
woman
well
that
woman
was
my
mother
the
executioner
uttered
the
first
cry
that
terrible
cry
which
had
been
first
heard
oh
pardon
me
pardon
me
he
murmured
if
not
in
the
name
of
god
at
least
in
your
own
name
if
not
as
priest
then
as
pardon
you
cried
the
pretended
monk
pardon
you
perhaps
god
will
pardon
you
but
i
never
for
pity
s
sake
said
the
executioner
extending
his
arms
no
pity
for
him
who
had
no
pity
die
impenitent
die
in
despair
die
and
be
damned
and
drawing
a
poniard
from
beneath
his
robe
he
thrust
it
into
the
breast
of
the
wounded
man
saying
here
is
my
absolution
then
was
heard
that
second
cry
not
so
loud
as
the
first
and
followed
by
a
long
groan
the
executioner
who
had
lifted
himself
up
fell
back
upon
his
bed
as
to
the
monk
without
withdrawing
the
poniard
from
the
wound
he
ran
to
the
window
opened
it
leaped
out
into
the
flowers
of
a
small
garden
glided
onward
to
the
stable
took
out
his
mule
went
out
by
a
back
gate
ran
to
a
neighbouring
thicket
threw
off
his
monkish
garb
took
from
his
valise
the
complete
habiliment
of
a
cavalier
clothed
himself
in
it
went
on
foot
to
the
first
post
secured
there
a
horse
and
continued
with
a
loose
rein
his
journey
to
paris
grimaud
speaks
grimaud
was
left
alone
with
the
executioner
who
in
a
few
moments
opened
his
eyes
help
help
he
murmured
oh
god
have
i
not
a
single
friend
in
the
world
who
will
aid
me
either
to
live
or
to
die
take
courage
said
grimaud
they
are
gone
to
find
who
are
you
asked
the
wounded
man
fixing
his
half
opened
eyes
on
grimaud
an
old
acquaintance
replied
grimaud
you
and
the
wounded
man
sought
to
recall
the
features
of
the
person
now
before
him
under
what
circumstances
did
we
meet
he
asked
again
one
night
twenty
years
ago
my
master
fetched
you
from
bethune
and
conducted
you
to
i
know
you
well
now
said
the
executioner
you
were
one
of
the
four
just
where
do
you
come
from
now
i
was
passing
by
and
drew
up
at
this
inn
to
rest
my
horse
they
told
me
the
executioner
of
bethune
was
here
and
wounded
when
you
uttered
two
piercing
cries
at
the
first
we
ran
to
the
door
and
at
the
second
forced
it
and
the
monk
exclaimed
the
executioner
did
you
see
the
monk
what
monk
the
monk
that
was
shut
in
with
no
he
was
no
longer
here
he
appears
to
have
fled
by
the
window
was
he
the
man
that
stabbed
you
yes
said
the
executioner
grimaud
moved
as
if
to
leave
the
room
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
the
wounded
man
he
must
be
do
not
attempt
it
he
has
revenged
himself
and
has
done
well
now
i
may
hope
that
god
will
forgive
me
since
my
crime
is
explain
said
grimaud
the
woman
whom
you
and
your
masters
commanded
me
to
kill
milady
yes
milady
it
is
true
you
called
her
what
has
the
monk
to
do
with
this
milady
she
was
his
grimaud
trembled
and
stared
at
the
dying
man
in
a
dull
and
leaden
manner
his
mother
he
repeated
yes
his
but
does
he
know
this
secret
then
i
mistook
him
for
a
monk
and
revealed
it
to
him
in
unhappy
man
cried
grimaud
whose
face
was
covered
with
sweat
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
evil
results
such
a
revelation
might
cause
unhappy
man
you
named
no
one
i
hope
i
pronounced
no
name
for
i
knew
none
except
his
mother
s
as
a
young
girl
and
it
was
by
this
name
that
he
recognized
her
but
he
knows
that
his
uncle
was
among
her
thus
speaking
he
fell
back
exhausted
grimaud
wishing
to
relieve
him
advanced
his
hand
toward
the
hilt
of
the
dagger
touch
me
not
said
the
executioner
if
this
dagger
is
withdrawn
i
shall
grimaud
remained
with
his
hand
extended
then
striking
his
forehead
he
exclaimed
oh
if
this
man
should
ever
discover
the
names
of
the
others
my
master
is
haste
haste
to
him
and
warn
him
cried
the
wounded
man
if
he
still
lives
warn
his
friends
too
my
death
believe
me
will
not
be
the
end
of
this
atrocious
where
was
the
monk
going
asked
grimaud
toward
who
stopped
him
two
young
gentlemen
who
were
on
their
way
to
join
the
army
and
the
name
of
one
of
whom
i
heard
his
companion
mention
the
viscount
de
and
it
was
this
young
man
who
brought
the
monk
to
you
then
it
was
the
will
of
god
that
it
should
be
so
and
this
it
is
which
makes
it
all
so
awful
continued
grimaud
and
yet
that
woman
deserved
her
fate
do
you
not
think
so
on
one
s
the
crimes
of
others
appear
very
small
in
comparison
with
one
s
own
said
the
executioner
and
falling
back
exhausted
he
closed
his
eyes
grimaud
was
reluctant
to
leave
the
man
alone
and
yet
he
perceived
the
necessity
of
starting
at
once
to
bear
these
tidings
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
whilst
he
thus
hesitated
the
host
the
room
followed
not
only
by
a
surgeon
but
by
many
other
persons
whom
curiosity
had
attracted
to
the
spot
the
surgeon
approached
the
dying
man
who
seemed
to
have
fainted
we
must
first
extract
the
steel
from
the
side
said
he
shaking
his
head
in
a
significant
manner
the
prophecy
which
the
wounded
man
had
just
uttered
recurred
to
grimaud
who
turned
away
his
head
the
weapon
as
we
have
already
stated
was
plunged
into
the
body
to
the
hilt
and
as
the
surgeon
taking
it
by
the
end
drew
it
forth
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
him
in
a
manner
truly
frightful
when
at
last
the
blade
had
been
entirely
withdrawn
a
red
froth
issued
from
the
mouth
of
the
wounded
man
and
a
stream
of
blood
spouted
afresh
from
the
wound
when
he
at
length
drew
breath
then
fixing
his
eyes
upon
grimaud
with
a
singular
expression
the
dying
man
uttered
the
last
and
expired
then
grimaud
lifting
the
dagger
from
the
pool
of
blood
which
was
gliding
along
the
room
to
the
horror
of
all
present
made
a
sign
to
the
host
to
follow
him
paid
him
with
a
generosity
worthy
of
his
master
and
again
mounted
his
horse
grimaud
s
first
intention
had
been
to
return
to
paris
but
he
remembered
the
anxiety
which
his
prolonged
absence
might
occasion
raoul
and
reflecting
that
there
were
now
only
two
miles
between
the
vicomte
and
himself
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
riding
would
unite
them
and
that
the
going
returning
and
explanation
would
not
occupy
an
hour
he
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
a
few
minutes
after
had
reached
the
only
inn
of
mazingarbe
raoul
was
seated
at
table
with
the
count
de
guiche
and
his
tutor
when
all
at
once
the
door
opened
and
grimaud
presented
himself
dirty
and
sprinkled
with
the
blood
of
the
unhappy
executioner
grimaud
my
good
grimaud
exclaimed
raoul
here
you
are
at
last
excuse
me
sirs
this
is
not
a
servant
but
a
friend
how
did
you
leave
the
count
continued
he
does
he
regret
me
a
little
have
you
seen
him
since
i
left
him
answer
for
i
have
many
things
to
tell
you
too
indeed
the
last
three
days
some
odd
adventures
have
happened
but
what
is
the
matter
how
pale
you
are
and
blood
too
what
is
this
it
is
the
blood
of
the
unfortunate
man
whom
you
left
at
the
inn
and
who
died
in
my
in
your
arms
that
man
but
know
you
who
he
was
he
used
to
be
the
headsman
of
you
knew
him
and
he
is
dead
well
sir
said
d
arminges
it
is
the
common
lot
even
an
executioner
is
not
exempted
i
had
a
bad
opinion
of
him
the
moment
i
saw
his
wound
and
since
he
asked
for
a
monk
you
know
that
it
was
his
opinion
too
that
death
would
at
the
mention
of
the
monk
grimaud
became
pale
come
come
continued
d
arminges
to
dinner
for
like
most
men
of
his
age
and
generation
he
did
not
allow
sentiment
or
sensibility
to
interfere
with
a
repast
you
are
right
sir
said
raoul
come
grimaud
order
dinner
for
yourself
and
when
you
have
rested
a
little
we
can
no
sir
no
said
grimaud
i
can
not
stop
a
moment
i
must
start
for
paris
again
what
you
start
for
paris
you
are
mistaken
it
is
olivain
who
leaves
me
you
are
to
on
the
contrary
olivain
is
to
stay
and
i
am
to
go
i
have
come
for
nothing
else
but
to
tell
you
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
change
i
can
not
tell
explain
i
can
not
explain
come
tell
me
what
is
the
joke
monsieur
le
vicomte
knows
that
i
never
yes
but
i
know
also
that
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
arranged
that
you
were
to
remain
with
me
and
that
olivain
should
return
to
paris
i
shall
follow
the
count
s
not
under
present
circumstances
perhaps
you
mean
to
disobey
me
yes
monsieur
i
you
persist
then
yes
i
am
going
may
you
be
happy
monsieur
and
grimaud
saluted
and
turned
toward
the
door
to
go
out
raoul
angry
and
at
the
same
time
uneasy
ran
after
him
and
seized
him
by
the
arm
grimaud
he
cried
remain
i
wish
then
replied
grimaud
you
wish
me
to
allow
monsieur
le
comte
to
be
he
saluted
and
made
a
movement
to
depart
grimaud
my
friend
said
the
viscount
will
you
leave
me
thus
in
such
anxiety
speak
speak
in
heaven
s
name
and
raoul
fell
back
trembling
upon
his
chair
i
can
tell
you
but
one
thing
sir
for
the
secret
you
wish
to
know
is
not
my
own
you
met
a
monk
did
you
not
the
young
men
looked
at
each
other
with
an
expression
of
fear
you
conducted
him
to
the
wounded
man
and
you
had
time
to
observe
him
and
perhaps
you
would
know
him
again
were
you
to
meet
yes
yes
cried
both
young
men
very
well
if
ever
you
meet
him
again
wherever
it
may
be
whether
on
the
high
road
or
in
the
street
or
in
a
church
anywhere
that
he
or
you
may
be
put
your
foot
on
his
neck
and
crush
him
without
pity
without
mercy
as
you
would
crush
a
viper
or
a
scorpion
destroy
him
utterly
and
quit
him
not
until
he
is
dead
the
lives
of
five
men
are
not
safe
in
my
opinion
as
long
as
he
is
on
the
and
without
adding
another
word
grimaud
profiting
by
the
astonishment
and
terror
into
which
he
had
thrown
his
auditors
rushed
from
the
room
two
minutes
later
the
thunder
of
a
horse
s
hoofs
was
heard
upon
the
road
it
was
grimaud
on
his
way
to
paris
when
once
in
the
saddle
grimaud
reflected
on
two
things
first
that
at
the
pace
he
was
going
his
horse
would
not
carry
him
ten
miles
and
secondly
that
he
had
no
money
but
grimaud
s
ingenuity
was
more
prolific
than
his
speech
and
therefore
at
the
first
halt
he
sold
his
steed
and
with
the
money
obtained
from
the
purchase
took
post
horses
on
the
eve
of
battle
raoul
was
aroused
from
his
sombre
reflections
by
his
host
who
rushed
into
the
apartment
crying
out
the
spaniards
the
spaniards
that
cry
was
of
such
importance
as
to
overcome
all
preoccupation
the
young
men
made
inquiries
and
ascertained
that
the
enemy
was
advancing
by
way
of
houdin
and
bethune
while
monsieur
d
arminges
gave
orders
for
the
horses
to
be
made
ready
for
departure
the
two
young
men
ascended
to
the
upper
windows
of
the
house
and
saw
in
the
direction
of
marsin
and
of
lens
a
large
body
of
infantry
and
cavalry
this
time
it
was
not
a
wandering
troop
of
partisans
it
was
an
entire
army
there
was
therefore
nothing
for
them
to
do
but
to
follow
the
prudent
advice
of
monsieur
d
arminges
and
beat
a
retreat
they
quickly
went
downstairs
monsieur
d
arminges
was
already
mounted
olivain
had
ready
the
horses
of
the
young
men
and
the
lackeys
of
the
count
de
guiche
guarded
carefully
between
them
the
spanish
prisoner
mounted
on
a
pony
which
had
been
bought
for
his
use
as
a
further
precaution
they
had
bound
his
hands
the
little
company
started
off
at
a
trot
on
the
road
to
cambrin
where
they
expected
to
find
the
prince
but
he
was
no
longer
there
having
withdrawn
on
the
previous
evening
to
la
bassee
misled
by
false
intelligence
of
the
enemy
s
movements
deceived
by
this
intelligence
he
had
concentrated
his
forces
between
and
la
venthie
and
after
a
reconnoissance
along
the
entire
line
in
company
with
marshal
de
grammont
he
had
returned
and
seated
himself
before
a
table
with
his
officers
around
him
he
questioned
them
as
to
the
news
they
had
each
been
charged
to
obtain
but
nothing
positive
had
been
learned
the
hostile
army
had
disappeared
two
days
before
and
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
existence
now
an
enemy
is
never
so
near
and
consequently
so
threatening
as
when
he
has
completely
disappeared
the
prince
was
therefore
contrary
to
his
custom
gloomy
and
anxious
when
an
officer
entered
and
announced
to
marshal
de
grammont
that
some
one
wished
to
see
him
the
duc
de
grammont
received
permission
from
the
prince
by
a
glance
and
went
out
the
prince
followed
him
with
his
eyes
and
continued
looking
at
the
door
no
one
ventured
to
speak
for
fear
of
disturbing
him
suddenly
a
dull
and
heavy
noise
was
heard
the
prince
leaped
to
his
feet
extending
his
hand
in
the
direction
whence
came
the
sound
there
was
no
mistaking
it
it
was
the
noise
of
cannon
every
one
stood
up
at
that
moment
the
door
opened
monseigneur
said
marshal
de
grammont
with
a
radiant
face
will
your
highness
permit
my
son
count
de
guiche
and
his
traveling
companion
viscount
de
bragelonne
to
come
in
and
give
news
of
the
enemy
whom
they
have
found
while
we
were
looking
for
him
what
eagerly
replied
the
prince
will
i
permit
i
not
only
permit
i
desire
let
them
come
the
marshal
introduced
the
two
young
men
and
placed
them
face
to
face
with
the
prince
speak
gentlemen
said
the
prince
saluting
them
first
speak
we
shall
have
time
afterward
for
the
usual
compliments
the
most
urgent
thing
now
is
to
learn
where
the
enemy
is
and
what
he
is
it
fell
naturally
to
the
count
de
guiche
to
make
reply
not
only
was
he
the
elder
but
he
had
been
presented
to
the
prince
by
his
father
besides
he
had
long
known
the
prince
whilst
raoul
now
saw
him
for
the
first
time
he
therefore
narrated
to
the
prince
what
they
had
seen
from
the
inn
at
mazingarbe
meanwhile
raoul
closely
observed
the
young
general
already
made
so
famous
by
the
battles
of
rocroy
fribourg
and
nordlingen
louis
de
bourbon
prince
de
conde
who
since
the
death
of
his
father
henri
de
bourbon
was
called
in
accordance
with
the
custom
of
that
period
monsieur
le
prince
was
a
young
man
not
more
than
or
years
old
with
the
eye
of
an
eagle
agl
occhi
grifani
as
dante
says
aquiline
nose
long
waving
hair
of
medium
height
well
formed
possessed
of
all
the
qualities
essential
to
the
successful
soldier
that
is
to
say
the
rapid
glance
quick
decision
fabulous
courage
at
the
same
time
he
was
a
man
of
elegant
manners
and
strong
mind
so
that
in
addition
to
the
revolution
he
had
made
in
war
by
his
new
contributions
to
its
methods
he
had
also
made
a
revolution
at
paris
among
the
young
noblemen
of
the
court
whose
natural
chief
he
was
and
who
in
distinction
from
the
social
leaders
of
the
ancient
court
modeled
after
bassompierre
bellegarde
and
the
duke
d
angouleme
were
called
the
at
the
first
words
of
the
count
de
guiche
the
prince
having
in
mind
the
direction
whence
came
the
sound
of
cannon
had
understood
everything
the
enemy
was
marching
upon
lens
with
the
intention
doubtless
of
securing
possession
of
that
town
and
separating
from
france
the
army
of
france
but
in
what
force
was
the
enemy
was
it
a
corps
sent
out
to
make
a
diversion
was
it
an
entire
army
to
this
question
de
guiche
could
not
respond
now
as
these
questions
involved
matters
of
gravest
consequence
it
was
these
to
which
the
prince
had
especially
desired
an
answer
exact
precise
positive
raoul
conquered
the
very
natural
feeling
of
timidity
he
experienced
and
approaching
the
prince
my
lord
he
said
will
you
permit
me
to
hazard
a
few
words
on
that
subject
which
will
perhaps
relieve
you
of
your
uncertainty
the
prince
turned
and
seemed
to
cover
the
young
man
with
a
single
glance
he
smiled
on
perceiving
that
he
was
a
child
hardly
fifteen
years
old
certainly
monsieur
speak
he
said
softening
his
stern
accented
tones
as
if
he
were
speaking
to
a
woman
my
lord
said
raoul
blushing
might
examine
the
spanish
have
you
a
spanish
prisoner
cried
the
prince
yes
my
ah
that
is
true
said
de
guiche
i
had
forgotten
that
is
easily
understood
it
was
you
who
took
him
count
said
raoul
smiling
the
old
marshal
turned
toward
the
viscount
grateful
for
that
praise
of
his
son
whilst
the
prince
exclaimed
the
young
man
is
right
let
the
prisoner
be
brought
meanwhile
the
prince
took
de
guiche
aside
and
asked
him
how
the
prisoner
had
been
taken
and
who
this
young
man
was
monsieur
said
the
prince
turning
toward
raoul
i
know
that
you
have
a
letter
from
my
sister
madame
de
longueville
but
i
see
that
you
have
preferred
commending
yourself
to
me
by
giving
me
good
my
lord
said
raoul
coloring
up
i
did
not
wish
to
interrupt
your
highness
in
a
conversation
so
important
as
that
in
which
you
were
engaged
with
the
count
but
here
is
the
very
well
said
the
prince
give
it
to
me
later
here
is
the
prisoner
let
us
attend
to
what
is
most
the
prisoner
was
one
of
those
military
adventurers
who
sold
their
blood
to
whoever
would
buy
and
grew
old
in
stratagems
and
spoils
since
he
had
been
taken
he
had
not
uttered
a
word
so
that
it
was
not
known
to
what
country
he
belonged
the
prince
looked
at
him
with
unspeakable
distrust
of
what
country
are
you
asked
the
prince
the
prisoner
muttered
a
few
words
in
a
foreign
tongue
ah
ah
it
seems
that
he
is
a
spaniard
do
you
speak
spanish
grammont
faith
my
lord
but
and
i
not
at
all
said
the
prince
laughing
gentlemen
he
said
turning
to
those
who
were
near
him
can
any
one
of
you
speak
spanish
and
serve
me
as
interpreter
i
can
my
lord
said
raoul
ah
you
speak
spanish
enough
i
think
to
fulfill
your
highness
s
wishes
on
this
meanwhile
the
prisoner
had
remained
impassive
and
as
if
he
had
no
understanding
of
what
was
taking
place
my
lord
asks
of
what
country
you
are
said
the
young
man
in
the
purest
castilian
ich
bin
ein
deutscher
replied
the
prisoner
what
in
the
devil
does
he
say
asked
the
prince
what
new
gibberish
is
that
he
says
he
is
german
my
lord
replied
raoul
but
i
doubt
it
for
his
accent
is
bad
and
his
pronunciation
then
you
speak
german
also
asked
the
prince
yes
my
well
enough
to
question
him
in
that
language
yes
my
question
him
raoul
began
the
examination
but
the
result
justified
his
opinion
the
prisoner
did
not
understand
or
seemed
not
to
understand
what
raoul
said
to
him
and
raoul
could
hardly
understand
his
replies
containing
a
mixture
of
flemish
and
alsatian
however
amidst
all
the
prisoner
s
efforts
to
elude
a
systematic
examination
raoul
had
recognized
his
natural
accent
non
siete
spagnuolo
he
said
non
siete
tedesco
siete
the
prisoner
started
and
bit
his
lips
ah
that
said
the
prince
i
understand
that
language
thoroughly
and
since
he
is
italian
i
will
myself
continue
the
examination
thank
you
viscount
continued
the
prince
laughing
and
i
appoint
you
from
this
moment
my
but
the
prisoner
was
not
less
unwilling
to
respond
in
italian
than
in
the
other
languages
his
aim
was
to
elude
the
examination
therefore
he
knew
nothing
either
of
the
enemy
s
numbers
or
of
those
in
command
or
of
the
purpose
of
the
army
very
good
said
the
prince
understanding
the
reason
of
that
ignorance
the
man
was
caught
in
the
act
of
assassination
and
robbery
he
might
have
purchased
his
life
by
speaking
he
doesn
t
wish
to
speak
take
him
out
and
shoot
the
prisoner
turned
pale
the
two
soldiers
who
had
brought
him
in
took
him
each
by
one
arm
and
led
him
toward
the
door
whilst
the
prince
turning
to
marshal
de
grammont
seemed
to
have
already
forgotten
the
order
he
had
given
when
he
reached
the
threshold
of
the
door
the
prisoner
stopped
the
soldiers
who
knew
only
their
orders
attempted
to
force
him
along
one
moment
said
the
prisoner
in
french
i
am
ready
to
speak
my
ah
ah
said
the
prince
laughing
i
thought
we
should
come
to
that
i
have
a
sure
method
of
limbering
tongues
young
men
take
advantage
of
it
against
the
time
when
you
may
be
in
but
on
condition
continued
the
prisoner
that
your
highness
will
swear
that
my
life
shall
be
upon
my
honor
said
the
prince
question
then
my
where
did
the
army
cross
the
lys
between
and
by
whom
is
it
commanded
by
count
de
fuonsaldagna
general
beck
and
the
of
how
many
does
it
consist
eighteen
thousand
men
and
and
its
aim
is
you
see
gentlemen
said
the
prince
turning
with
a
triumphant
air
toward
marshal
de
grammont
and
the
other
officers
yes
my
lord
said
the
marshal
you
have
divined
all
that
was
possible
to
human
recall
le
plessis
bellievre
villequier
and
d
erlac
said
the
prince
recall
all
the
troops
that
are
on
this
side
of
the
lys
let
them
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
march
according
to
all
probability
we
shall
attack
the
but
my
lord
said
marshal
de
grammont
consider
that
when
we
have
collected
all
our
forces
we
shall
have
hardly
thirteen
thousand
monsieur
le
marechal
said
the
prince
with
that
wonderful
glance
that
was
peculiar
to
him
it
is
with
small
armies
that
great
battles
are
then
turning
toward
the
prisoner
take
away
that
man
he
said
and
keep
him
carefully
in
sight
his
life
is
dependent
on
the
information
he
has
given
us
if
it
is
true
he
shall
be
free
if
false
let
him
be
the
prisoner
was
led
away
count
de
guiche
said
the
prince
it
is
a
long
time
since
you
saw
your
father
remain
here
with
him
monsieur
he
continued
addressing
raoul
if
you
are
not
too
tired
follow
to
the
end
of
the
world
my
lord
cried
raoul
feeling
an
unknown
enthusiasm
for
that
young
general
who
seemed
to
him
so
worthy
of
his
renown
the
prince
smiled
he
despised
flatterers
but
he
appreciated
enthusiasts
come
monsieur
he
said
you
are
good
in
council
as
we
have
already
discovered
we
shall
know
if
you
are
good
in
and
i
said
the
marshal
what
am
i
to
do
wait
here
to
receive
the
troops
i
shall
either
return
for
them
myself
or
shall
send
a
courier
directing
you
to
bring
them
to
me
twenty
guards
well
mounted
are
all
that
i
shall
need
for
my
that
is
very
few
said
the
marshal
it
is
enough
replied
the
prince
have
you
a
good
horse
monsieur
de
bragelonne
my
horse
was
killed
this
morning
my
lord
and
i
am
mounted
provisionally
on
my
lackey
choose
for
yourself
in
my
stables
the
horse
you
like
best
no
false
modesty
take
the
best
horse
you
can
find
you
will
need
it
this
evening
perhaps
you
will
certainly
need
it
raoul
didn
t
wait
to
be
told
twice
he
knew
that
with
superiors
especially
when
those
superiors
are
princes
the
highest
politeness
is
to
obey
without
delay
or
argument
he
went
down
to
the
stables
picked
out
a
andalusian
horse
saddled
and
bridled
it
himself
for
athos
had
advised
him
to
trust
no
one
with
those
important
offices
at
a
time
of
danger
and
went
to
rejoin
the
prince
who
at
that
moment
mounted
his
horse
now
monsieur
he
said
to
raoul
will
you
give
me
the
letter
you
have
brought
raoul
handed
the
letter
to
the
prince
keep
near
me
said
the
latter
the
prince
threw
his
bridle
over
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
as
he
was
wont
to
do
when
he
wished
to
have
both
hands
free
unsealed
the
letter
of
madame
de
longueville
and
started
at
a
gallop
on
the
road
to
lens
attended
by
raoul
and
his
small
escort
whilst
messengers
sent
to
recall
the
troops
set
out
with
a
loose
rein
in
other
directions
the
prince
read
as
he
hastened
on
monsieur
he
said
after
a
moment
they
tell
me
great
things
of
you
i
have
only
to
say
after
the
little
that
i
have
seen
and
heard
that
i
think
even
better
of
you
than
i
have
been
raoul
bowed
meanwhile
as
the
little
troop
drew
nearer
to
lens
the
noise
of
the
cannon
sounded
louder
the
prince
kept
his
gaze
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
with
the
steadfastness
of
a
bird
of
prey
one
would
have
said
that
his
gaze
could
pierce
the
branches
of
trees
which
limited
his
horizon
from
time
to
time
his
nostrils
dilated
as
if
eager
for
the
smell
of
powder
and
he
panted
like
a
horse
at
length
they
heard
the
cannon
so
near
that
it
was
evident
they
were
within
a
league
of
the
field
of
battle
and
at
a
turn
of
the
road
they
perceived
the
little
village
of
aunay
the
peasants
were
in
great
commotion
the
report
of
spanish
cruelty
had
gone
out
and
every
one
was
frightened
the
women
had
already
fled
taking
refuge
in
vitry
only
a
few
men
remained
on
seeing
the
prince
they
hastened
to
meet
him
one
of
them
recognized
him
ah
my
lord
he
said
have
you
come
to
drive
away
those
rascal
spaniards
and
those
lorraine
robbers
yes
said
the
prince
if
you
will
serve
me
as
willingly
my
lord
where
does
your
highness
wish
to
go
to
some
elevated
spot
whence
i
can
look
down
on
lens
and
the
surrounding
country
in
that
case
i
m
your
i
can
trust
you
you
are
a
true
frenchman
i
am
an
old
soldier
of
rocroy
my
here
said
the
prince
handing
him
a
purse
here
is
for
rocroy
now
do
you
want
a
horse
or
will
you
go
afoot
afoot
my
lord
i
have
served
always
in
the
infantry
besides
i
expect
to
lead
your
highness
into
places
where
you
will
have
to
come
then
said
the
prince
let
us
lose
no
the
peasant
started
off
running
before
the
prince
s
horse
then
a
hundred
steps
from
the
village
he
took
a
narrow
road
hidden
at
the
bottom
of
the
valley
for
a
half
league
they
proceeded
thus
the
sounding
so
near
that
they
expected
at
each
discharge
to
hear
the
hum
of
the
balls
at
length
they
entered
a
path
which
going
out
from
the
road
skirted
the
mountainside
the
prince
dismounted
ordered
one
of
his
aids
and
raoul
to
follow
his
example
and
directed
the
others
to
await
his
orders
keeping
themselves
meanwhile
on
the
alert
he
then
began
to
ascend
the
path
in
about
ten
minutes
they
reached
the
ruins
of
an
old
chateau
those
ruins
crowned
the
summit
of
a
hill
which
overlooked
the
surrounding
country
at
a
distance
of
hardly
a
quarter
of
a
league
they
looked
down
on
lens
at
bay
and
before
lens
the
enemy
s
entire
army
with
a
single
glance
the
prince
took
in
the
extent
of
country
that
lay
before
him
from
lens
as
far
as
vimy
in
a
moment
the
plan
of
the
battle
which
on
the
following
day
was
to
save
france
the
second
time
from
invasion
was
unrolled
in
his
mind
he
took
a
pencil
tore
a
page
from
his
tablets
and
wrote
my
dear
marshal
in
an
hour
lens
will
be
in
the
enemy
s
possession
come
and
rejoin
me
bring
with
you
the
whole
army
i
shall
be
at
vendin
to
place
it
in
position
we
shall
retake
lens
and
beat
the
then
turning
toward
raoul
go
monsieur
he
said
ride
fast
and
give
this
letter
to
monsieur
de
raoul
bowed
took
the
letter
went
hastily
down
the
mountain
leaped
on
his
horse
and
set
out
at
a
gallop
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
with
the
marshal
a
portion
of
the
troops
had
already
arrived
and
the
remainder
was
expected
from
moment
to
moment
marshal
de
grammont
put
himself
at
the
head
of
all
the
available
cavalry
and
infantry
and
took
the
road
to
vendin
leaving
the
duc
de
chatillon
to
await
and
bring
on
the
rest
all
the
artillery
was
ready
to
move
and
started
off
at
a
moment
s
notice
it
was
seven
o
clock
in
the
evening
when
the
marshal
arrived
at
the
appointed
place
the
prince
awaited
him
there
as
he
had
foreseen
lens
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
immediately
after
raoul
s
departure
the
event
was
announced
by
the
cessation
of
the
firing
as
the
shadows
of
night
deepened
the
troops
summoned
by
the
prince
arrived
in
successive
detachments
orders
were
given
that
no
drum
should
be
beaten
no
trumpet
sounded
at
nine
o
clock
the
night
had
fully
come
still
a
last
ray
of
twilight
lighted
the
plain
the
army
marched
silently
the
prince
at
the
head
of
the
column
presently
the
army
came
in
sight
of
lens
two
or
three
houses
were
in
flames
and
a
dull
noise
was
heard
which
indicated
what
suffering
was
endured
by
a
town
taken
by
assault
the
prince
assigned
to
every
one
his
post
marshal
de
grammont
was
to
hold
the
extreme
left
resting
on
mericourt
the
duc
de
chatillon
commanded
the
centre
finally
the
prince
led
the
right
wing
resting
on
aunay
the
order
of
battle
on
the
morrow
was
to
be
that
of
the
positions
taken
in
the
evening
each
one
on
awaking
would
find
himself
on
the
field
of
battle
the
movement
was
executed
in
silence
and
with
precision
at
ten
o
clock
every
one
was
in
his
appointed
position
at
ten
the
prince
visited
the
posts
and
gave
his
final
orders
for
the
following
day
three
things
were
especially
urged
upon
the
officers
who
were
to
see
that
the
soldiers
observed
them
scrupulously
the
first
that
the
different
corps
should
so
march
that
cavalry
and
infantry
should
be
on
the
same
line
and
that
each
body
should
protect
its
gaps
the
second
to
go
to
the
charge
no
faster
than
a
walk
the
third
to
let
the
enemy
fire
first
the
prince
assigned
the
count
de
guiche
to
his
father
and
kept
bragelonne
near
his
own
person
but
the
two
young
men
sought
the
privilege
of
passing
the
night
together
and
it
was
accorded
them
a
tent
was
erected
for
them
near
that
of
the
marshal
although
the
day
had
been
fatiguing
neither
of
them
was
inclined
to
sleep
and
besides
even
for
old
soldiers
the
evening
before
a
battle
is
a
serious
time
it
was
so
with
greater
reason
to
two
young
men
who
were
about
to
witness
for
the
first
time
that
terrible
spectacle
on
the
evening
before
a
battle
one
thinks
of
a
thousand
things
forgotten
till
then
those
who
are
indifferent
to
one
another
become
friends
and
those
who
are
friends
become
brothers
it
need
not
be
said
that
if
in
the
depths
of
the
heart
there
is
a
sentiment
more
tender
it
reaches
then
quite
naturally
the
highest
exaltation
of
which
it
is
capable
some
sentiment
of
this
kind
must
have
been
cherished
by
each
one
of
these
two
friends
for
each
of
them
almost
immediately
sat
down
by
himself
at
an
end
of
the
tent
and
began
to
write
the
letters
were
long
the
four
pages
were
covered
with
closely
written
words
the
writers
sometimes
looked
up
at
each
other
and
smiled
they
understood
without
speaking
their
organizations
were
so
delicate
and
sympathetic
the
letters
being
finished
each
put
his
own
into
two
envelopes
so
that
no
one
without
tearing
the
first
envelope
could
discover
to
whom
the
second
was
addressed
then
they
drew
near
to
each
other
and
smilingly
exchanged
their
letters
in
case
any
evil
should
happen
to
me
said
bragelonne
in
case
i
should
be
killed
said
de
guiche
they
then
embraced
each
other
like
two
brothers
and
each
wrapping
himself
in
his
cloak
they
soon
passed
into
that
kindly
sleep
of
youth
which
is
the
prerogative
of
birds
flowers
and
infants
a
dinner
in
the
old
style
the
second
interview
between
the
former
musketeers
was
not
so
formal
and
threatening
as
the
first
athos
with
his
superior
understanding
wisely
deemed
that
the
supper
table
would
be
the
most
complete
and
satisfactory
point
of
reunion
and
at
the
moment
when
his
friends
in
deference
to
his
deportment
and
sobriety
dared
scarcely
speak
of
some
of
their
former
good
dinners
he
was
the
first
to
propose
that
they
should
all
assemble
around
some
well
spread
table
and
abandon
themselves
unreservedly
to
their
own
natural
character
and
manners
a
freedom
which
had
formerly
contributed
so
much
to
that
good
understanding
between
them
which
gave
them
the
name
of
the
inseparables
for
different
reasons
this
was
an
agreeable
proposition
to
them
all
and
it
was
therefore
agreed
that
each
should
leave
a
very
exact
address
and
that
upon
the
request
of
any
of
the
associates
a
meeting
should
be
convoked
at
a
famous
eating
house
in
the
rue
de
la
monnaie
of
the
sign
of
the
hermitage
the
first
rendezvous
was
fixed
for
the
following
wednesday
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
precisely
on
that
day
in
fact
the
four
friends
arrived
punctually
at
the
hour
each
from
his
own
abode
or
occupation
porthos
had
been
trying
a
new
horse
d
artagnan
was
on
guard
at
the
louvre
aramis
had
been
to
visit
one
of
his
penitents
in
the
neighborhood
and
athos
whose
domicile
was
established
in
the
rue
guenegaud
found
himself
close
at
hand
they
were
therefore
somewhat
surprised
to
meet
altogether
at
the
door
of
the
hermitage
athos
starting
out
from
the
pont
neuf
porthos
by
the
rue
de
la
roule
d
artagnan
by
the
rue
des
fosse
saint
germain
l
auxerrois
and
aramis
by
the
rue
de
bethisy
the
first
words
exchanged
between
the
four
friends
on
account
of
the
ceremony
which
each
of
them
mingled
with
their
demonstration
were
somewhat
forced
and
even
the
repast
began
with
a
kind
of
stiffness
athos
perceived
this
embarrassment
and
by
way
of
supplying
an
effectual
remedy
called
for
four
bottles
of
champagne
at
this
order
given
in
athos
s
habitually
calm
manner
the
face
of
the
gascon
relaxed
and
porthos
s
brow
grew
smooth
aramis
was
astonished
he
knew
that
athos
not
only
never
drank
but
more
that
he
had
a
kind
of
repugnance
to
wine
this
astonishment
was
doubled
when
aramis
saw
athos
fill
a
bumper
and
toss
it
off
with
all
his
former
enthusiasm
his
companions
followed
his
example
in
a
very
few
minutes
the
four
bottles
were
empty
and
this
excellent
specific
succeeded
in
dissipating
even
the
slightest
cloud
that
might
have
rested
on
their
spirits
now
the
four
friends
began
to
speak
loud
scarcely
waiting
till
one
had
finished
before
another
began
and
each
assumed
his
favorite
attitude
on
or
at
the
table
soon
strange
fact
aramis
undid
two
buttons
of
his
doublet
seeing
which
porthos
unfastened
his
entirely
battles
long
journeys
blows
given
and
received
sufficed
for
the
first
themes
of
conversation
which
turned
upon
the
silent
struggles
sustained
against
him
who
was
now
called
the
great
cardinal
faith
said
aramis
laughing
we
have
praised
the
dead
enough
let
us
revile
the
living
a
little
i
should
like
to
say
something
evil
of
mazarin
is
it
permissible
go
on
go
on
replied
d
artagnan
laughing
heartily
relate
your
story
and
i
will
applaud
it
if
it
is
a
good
a
great
prince
said
aramis
with
whom
mazarin
sought
an
alliance
was
invited
by
him
to
send
him
a
list
of
the
conditions
on
which
he
would
do
him
the
honor
to
negotiate
with
him
the
prince
who
had
a
great
repugnance
to
treat
with
such
an
fellow
made
out
a
list
against
the
grain
and
sent
it
in
this
list
there
were
three
conditions
which
displeased
mazarin
and
he
offered
the
prince
ten
thousand
crowns
to
renounce
ah
ha
ha
laughed
the
three
friends
not
a
bad
bargain
and
there
was
no
fear
of
being
taken
at
his
word
what
did
the
prince
do
then
the
prince
immediately
sent
fifty
thousand
francs
to
mazarin
begging
him
never
to
write
to
him
again
and
offered
twenty
thousand
francs
more
on
condition
that
he
would
never
speak
to
him
what
did
mazarin
do
stormed
suggested
athos
beat
the
messenger
cried
porthos
accepted
the
money
said
d
artagnan
you
have
guessed
it
answered
aramis
and
they
all
laughed
so
heartily
that
the
host
appeared
in
order
to
inquire
whether
the
gentlemen
wanted
anything
he
thought
they
were
fighting
at
last
their
hilarity
calmed
down
and
faith
exclaimed
d
artagnan
to
the
two
friends
you
may
well
wish
ill
to
mazarin
for
i
assure
you
on
his
side
he
wishes
you
no
pooh
really
asked
athos
if
i
thought
the
fellow
knew
me
by
my
name
i
would
be
rebaptized
for
fear
it
might
be
thought
i
knew
he
knows
you
better
by
your
actions
than
your
name
he
is
quite
aware
that
there
are
two
gentlemen
who
greatly
aided
the
escape
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
and
he
has
instigated
an
active
search
for
them
i
can
answer
for
by
whom
by
me
and
this
morning
he
sent
for
me
to
ask
me
if
i
had
obtained
any
and
what
did
you
reply
that
i
had
none
as
yet
but
that
i
was
to
dine
with
two
gentlemen
who
would
be
able
to
give
me
you
told
him
that
said
porthos
a
broad
smile
spreading
over
his
honest
face
bravo
and
you
are
not
afraid
of
that
athos
no
replied
athos
it
is
not
the
search
of
mazarin
that
i
now
said
aramis
tell
me
a
little
what
you
do
nothing
for
the
present
at
least
nothing
in
good
and
with
regard
to
the
past
asked
porthos
oh
the
past
is
another
thing
said
athos
sighing
the
past
and
the
are
you
afraid
for
your
young
raoul
asked
aramis
well
said
d
artagnan
one
is
never
killed
in
a
first
nor
in
the
second
said
aramis
nor
in
the
third
returned
porthos
and
even
when
one
is
killed
one
rises
again
the
proof
of
which
is
that
here
we
are
no
said
athos
it
is
not
raoul
about
whom
i
am
anxious
for
i
trust
he
will
conduct
himself
like
a
gentleman
and
if
he
is
killed
well
he
will
die
bravely
but
hold
should
such
a
misfortune
happen
well
athos
passed
his
hand
across
his
pale
brow
well
asked
aramis
well
i
shall
look
upon
it
as
an
ah
said
d
artagnan
i
know
what
you
and
i
too
added
aramis
but
you
must
not
think
of
that
athos
what
is
past
is
i
don
t
understand
said
porthos
the
affair
at
armentieres
whispered
d
artagnan
the
affair
at
armentieres
asked
he
again
oh
yes
said
porthos
true
i
had
forgotten
it
athos
looked
at
him
intently
you
have
forgotten
it
porthos
said
he
faith
yes
it
is
so
long
ago
answered
porthos
this
affair
does
not
then
weigh
upon
your
conscience
faith
and
you
d
artagnan
i
i
own
that
when
my
mind
returns
to
that
terrible
period
i
have
no
recollection
of
anything
but
the
rigid
corpse
of
poor
madame
bonancieux
yes
yes
murmured
he
i
have
often
felt
regret
for
the
victim
but
never
the
very
slightest
remorse
for
the
athos
shook
his
dead
doubtfully
consider
said
aramis
if
you
admit
divine
justice
and
its
participation
in
the
things
of
this
world
that
woman
was
punished
by
the
will
of
heaven
we
were
but
the
instruments
that
is
but
as
to
free
will
aramis
how
acts
the
judge
he
has
a
free
will
yet
he
fearlessly
condemns
what
does
the
executioner
he
is
master
of
his
arm
yet
he
strikes
without
the
executioner
muttered
athos
as
if
arrested
by
some
recollection
i
know
that
it
is
terrible
said
d
artagnan
but
when
i
reflect
that
we
have
killed
english
rochellais
spaniards
nay
even
french
who
never
did
us
any
other
harm
but
to
aim
at
and
to
miss
us
whose
only
fault
was
to
cross
swords
with
us
and
to
be
unable
to
ward
off
our
blows
i
can
on
my
honor
find
an
excuse
for
my
share
in
the
murder
of
that
as
for
me
said
porthos
now
that
you
have
reminded
me
of
it
athos
i
have
the
scene
again
before
me
as
if
i
now
were
there
milady
was
there
as
it
were
where
you
athos
changed
color
i
i
was
where
d
artagnan
stands
i
wore
a
long
sword
which
cut
like
a
damascus
you
remember
it
aramis
for
you
always
called
it
balizarde
well
i
swear
to
you
all
three
that
had
the
executioner
of
bethune
was
he
not
of
bethune
yes
egad
of
bethune
not
been
there
i
would
have
cut
off
the
head
of
that
infamous
being
without
thinking
of
it
or
even
after
thinking
of
it
she
was
a
most
atrocious
and
then
said
aramis
with
the
tone
of
philosophical
indifference
which
he
had
assumed
since
he
had
belonged
to
the
church
and
in
which
there
was
more
atheism
than
confidence
in
god
what
is
the
use
of
thinking
of
it
all
at
the
last
hour
we
must
confess
this
action
and
god
knows
better
than
we
can
whether
it
is
a
crime
a
fault
or
a
meritorious
deed
i
repent
of
it
egad
no
upon
my
honor
and
by
the
holy
cross
i
only
regret
it
because
she
was
a
the
most
satisfactory
part
of
the
matter
said
d
artagnan
is
that
there
remains
no
trace
of
she
had
a
son
observed
athos
oh
yes
i
know
that
said
d
artagnan
and
you
mentioned
it
to
me
but
who
knows
what
has
become
of
him
if
the
serpent
be
dead
why
not
its
brood
do
you
think
his
uncle
de
winter
would
have
brought
up
that
young
viper
de
winter
probably
condemned
the
son
as
he
had
done
the
then
said
athos
woe
to
de
winter
for
the
child
had
done
no
may
the
devil
take
me
if
the
child
be
not
dead
said
porthos
there
is
so
much
fog
in
that
detestable
country
at
least
so
d
artagnan
just
as
the
quaint
conclusion
reached
by
porthos
was
about
to
bring
back
hilarity
to
faces
now
more
or
less
clouded
hasty
footsteps
were
heard
upon
the
stair
and
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
cried
athos
please
your
honors
said
the
host
a
person
in
a
great
hurry
wishes
to
speak
to
one
of
to
which
of
us

him
who
is
called
the
comte
de
la
it
is
i
said
athos
and
what
is
the
name
of
the
person
ah
exclaimed
athos
turning
pale
back
already
what
can
have
happened
then
to
bragelonne
let
him
enter
cried
d
artagnan
let
him
come
but
grimaud
had
already
mounted
the
staircase
and
was
waiting
on
the
last
step
so
springing
into
the
room
he
motioned
the
host
to
leave
it
the
door
being
closed
the
four
friends
waited
in
expectation
grimaud
s
agitation
his
pallor
the
sweat
which
covered
his
face
the
dust
which
soiled
his
clothes
all
indicated
that
he
was
the
messenger
of
some
important
and
terrible
news
your
honors
said
he
that
woman
had
a
child
that
child
has
become
a
man
the
tigress
had
a
little
one
the
tiger
has
roused
himself
he
is
ready
to
spring
upon
you
beware
athos
glanced
around
at
his
friends
with
a
melancholy
smile
porthos
turned
to
look
at
his
sword
which
was
hanging
on
the
wall
aramis
seized
his
knife
d
artagnan
arose
what
do
you
mean
grimaud
he
exclaimed
that
milady
s
son
has
left
england
that
he
is
in
france
on
his
road
to
paris
if
he
be
not
here
the
devil
he
is
said
porthos
are
you
sure
of
it
certain
replied
grimaud
this
announcement
was
received
in
silence
grimaud
was
so
breathless
so
exhausted
that
he
had
fallen
back
upon
a
chair
athos
filled
a
beaker
with
champagne
and
gave
it
to
him
well
after
all
said
d
artagnan
supposing
that
he
lives
that
he
comes
to
paris
we
have
seen
many
other
such
let
him
yes
echoed
porthos
glancing
affectionately
at
his
sword
still
hanging
on
the
wall
we
can
wait
for
him
let
him
moreover
he
is
but
a
child
said
aramis
grimaud
rose
a
child
he
exclaimed
do
you
know
what
he
has
done
this
child
disguised
as
a
monk
he
discovered
the
whole
history
in
confession
from
the
executioner
of
bethune
and
having
confessed
him
after
having
learned
everything
from
him
he
gave
him
absolution
by
planting
this
dagger
into
his
heart
see
it
is
on
fire
yet
with
his
hot
blood
for
it
is
not
thirty
hours
since
it
was
drawn
from
the
and
grimaud
threw
the
dagger
on
the
table
d
artagnan
porthos
and
aramis
rose
and
in
one
spontaneous
motion
rushed
to
their
swords
athos
alone
remained
seated
calm
and
thoughtful
and
you
say
he
is
dressed
as
a
monk
grimaud
yes
as
an
augustine
what
sized
man
is
he
about
my
height
thin
pale
with
light
blue
eyes
and
tawny
flaxen
and
he
did
not
see
raoul
asked
athos
yes
on
the
contrary
they
met
and
it
was
the
viscount
himself
who
conducted
him
to
the
bed
of
the
dying
athos
in
his
turn
rising
without
speaking
went
and
unhooked
his
sword
heigh
sir
said
d
artagnan
trying
to
laugh
do
you
know
we
look
very
much
like
a
flock
of
silly
women
how
is
it
that
we
four
men
who
have
faced
armies
without
blinking
begin
to
tremble
at
the
mention
of
a
child
it
is
true
said
athos
but
this
child
comes
in
the
name
of
and
very
soon
they
left
the
inn
a
letter
from
charles
the
first
the
reader
must
now
cross
the
seine
with
us
and
follow
us
to
the
door
of
the
carmelite
convent
in
the
rue
saint
jacques
it
is
eleven
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
the
pious
sisters
have
just
finished
saying
mass
for
the
success
of
the
armies
of
king
charles
i
leaving
the
church
a
woman
and
a
young
girl
dressed
in
black
the
one
as
a
widow
and
the
other
as
an
orphan
have
their
cell
the
woman
kneels
on
a
of
painted
wood
and
at
a
short
distance
from
her
stands
the
young
girl
leaning
against
a
chair
weeping
the
woman
must
have
once
been
handsome
but
traces
of
sorrow
have
aged
her
the
young
girl
is
lovely
and
her
tears
only
embellish
her
the
lady
appears
to
be
about
forty
years
of
age
the
girl
about
fourteen
oh
god
prayed
the
kneeling
suppliant
protect
my
husband
guard
my
son
and
take
my
wretched
life
instead
oh
god
murmured
the
girl
leave
me
my
mother
your
mother
can
be
of
no
use
to
you
in
this
world
henrietta
said
the
lady
turning
around
your
mother
has
no
longer
either
throne
or
husband
she
has
neither
son
money
nor
friends
the
whole
world
my
poor
child
has
abandoned
your
mother
and
she
fell
back
weeping
into
her
daughter
s
arms
courage
take
courage
my
dear
mother
said
the
girl
ah
tis
an
unfortunate
year
for
kings
said
the
mother
and
no
one
thinks
of
us
in
this
country
for
each
must
think
about
his
own
affairs
as
long
as
your
brother
was
with
me
he
kept
me
up
but
he
is
gone
and
can
no
longer
send
us
news
of
himself
either
to
me
or
to
your
father
i
have
pledged
my
last
jewels
sold
your
clothes
and
my
own
to
pay
his
servants
who
refused
to
accompany
him
unless
i
made
this
sacrifice
we
are
now
reduced
to
live
at
the
expense
of
these
daughters
of
heaven
we
are
the
poor
succored
by
but
why
not
address
yourself
to
your
sister
the
queen
asked
the
girl
alas

queen
my
sister
is
no
longer
queen
my
child

reigns
in
her
name
one
day

be
able
to
understand
how
all
this
well
then
to
the
king
your
nephew
shall
i
speak
to
him
you
know
how
much
he
loves
me
my
mother
alas
my
nephew

not
yet
king
and
you
know
laporte
has
told
us
twenty
times
that
he
himself
is
in
need
of
almost
then
let
us
pray
to
heaven
said
the
girl
the
two
women
who
thus
knelt
in
united
prayer
were
the
daughter
and
of
henry
the
wife
and
daughter
of
charles
i
they
had
just
finished
their
double
prayer
when
a
nun
softly
tapped
at
the
door
of
the
cell
enter
my
sister
said
the
queen
i
trust
your
majesty
will
pardon
this
intrusion
on
her
meditations
but
a
foreign
lord
has
arrived
from
england
and
waits
in
the
parlor
demanding
the
honor
of
presenting
a
letter
to
your
oh
a
letter
a
letter
from
the
king
perhaps
news
from
your
father
do
you
hear
henrietta
and
the
name
of
this
lord
lord
de
lord
de
winter
exclaimed
the
queen
the
friend
of
my
husband
oh
bid
him
enter
and
the
queen
advanced
to
meet
the
messenger
whose
hand
she
seized
affectionately
whilst
he
knelt
down
and
presented
a
letter
to
her
contained
in
a
case
of
gold
ah
my
lord
said
the
queen
you
bring
us
three
things
which
we
have
not
seen
for
a
long
time
gold
a
devoted
friend
and
a
letter
from
the
king
our
husband
and
de
winter
bowed
again
unable
to
reply
from
excess
of
emotion
on
their
side
the
mother
and
daughter
retired
into
the
embrasure
of
a
window
to
read
eagerly
the
following
letter
dear
wife
we
have
now
reached
the
moment
of
decision
i
have
concentrated
here
at
naseby
camp
all
the
resources
heaven
has
left
me
and
i
write
to
you
in
haste
from
thence
here
i
await
the
army
of
my
rebellious
subjects
i
am
about
to
struggle
for
the
last
time
with
them
if
victorious
i
shall
continue
the
struggle
if
beaten
i
am
lost
i
shall
try
in
the
latter
case
alas
in
our
position
one
must
provide
for
everything
i
shall
try
to
gain
the
coast
of
france
but
can
they
will
they
receive
an
unhappy
king
who
will
bring
such
a
sad
story
into
a
country
already
agitated
by
civil
discord
your
wisdom
and
your
affection
must
serve
me
as
guides
the
bearer
of
this
letter
will
tell
you
madame
what
i
dare
not
trust
to
pen
and
paper
and
the
risks
of
transit
he
will
explain
to
you
the
steps
that
i
expect
you
to
pursue
i
charge
him
also
with
my
blessing
for
my
children
and
with
the
sentiments
of
my
soul
for
yourself
my
dearest
the
letter
bore
the
signature
not
of
charles
king
but
of
charles
still
and
let
him
be
no
longer
king
cried
the
queen
let
him
be
conquered
exiled
proscribed
provided
he
still
lives
alas
in
these
days
the
throne
is
too
dangerous
a
place
for
me
to
wish
him
to
retain
it
but
my
lord
tell
me
she
continued
hide
nothing
from
me
what
is
in
truth
the
king
s
position
is
it
as
hopeless
as
he
thinks
alas
madame
more
hopeless
than
he
thinks
his
majesty
has
so
good
a
heart
that
he
can
not
understand
hatred
is
so
loyal
that
he
does
not
suspect
treason
england
is
torn
in
twain
by
a
spirit
of
disturbance
which
i
greatly
fear
blood
alone
can
but
lord
montrose
replied
the
queen
i
have
heard
of
his
great
and
rapid
successes
of
battles
gained
i
heard
it
said
that
he
was
marching
to
the
frontier
to
join
the
yes
madame
but
on
the
frontier
he
was
met
by
lesly
he
had
tried
victory
by
means
of
superhuman
undertakings
now
victory
has
abandoned
him
montrose
beaten
at
philiphaugh
was
obliged
to
disperse
the
remains
of
his
army
and
to
fly
disguised
as
a
servant
he
is
at
bergen
in
heaven
preserve
him
said
the
queen
it
is
at
least
a
consolation
to
know
that
some
who
have
so
often
risked
their
lives
for
us
are
safe
and
now
my
lord
that
i
see
how
hopeless
the
position
of
the
king
is
tell
me
with
what
you
are
charged
on
the
part
of
my
royal
well
then
madame
said
de
winter
the
king
wishes
you
to
try
and
discover
the
dispositions
of
the
king
and
queen
toward
alas
you
know
that
even
now
the
king
is
but
a
child
and
the
queen
a
woman
weak
enough
here
monsieur
mazarin
is
does
he
desire
to
play
the
part
in
france
that
cromwell
plays
in
england
oh
no
he
is
a
subtle
conscienceless
italian
who
though
he
very
likely
dreams
of
crime
dares
not
commit
it
and
unlike
cromwell
who
disposes
of
both
houses
mazarin
has
had
the
queen
to
support
him
in
his
struggle
with
the
more
reason
then
he
should
protect
a
king
pursued
by
the
queen
shook
her
head
despairingly
if
i
judge
for
myself
my
lord
she
said
the
cardinal
will
do
nothing
and
will
even
perhaps
act
against
us
the
presence
of
my
daughter
and
myself
in
france
is
already
irksome
to
him
much
more
so
would
be
that
of
the
king
my
lord
added
henrietta
with
a
melancholy
smile
it
is
sad
and
almost
shameful
to
be
obliged
to
say
that
we
have
passed
the
winter
in
the
louvre
without
money
without
linen
almost
without
bread
and
often
not
rising
from
bed
because
we
wanted
horrible
cried
de
winter
the
daughter
of
henry
and
the
wife
of
king
charles
wherefore
did
you
not
apply
then
madame
to
the
first
person
you
saw
from
us
such
is
the
hospitality
shown
to
a
queen
by
the
minister
from
whom
a
king
demands
but
i
heard
that
a
marriage
between
the
prince
of
wales
and
mademoiselle
d
orleans
was
spoken
of
said
de
winter
yes
for
an
instant
i
hoped
it
was
so
the
young
people
felt
a
mutual
esteem
but
the
queen
who
at
first
sanctioned
their
affection
changed
her
mind
and
monsieur
the
duc
d
orleans
who
had
encouraged
the
familiarity
between
them
has
forbidden
his
daughter
to
think
any
more
about
the
union
oh
my
lord
continued
the
queen
without
restraining
her
tears
it
is
better
to
fight
as
the
king
has
done
and
to
die
as
perhaps
he
will
than
live
in
beggary
like
courage
madame
courage
do
not
despair
the
interests
of
the
french
crown
endangered
at
this
moment
are
to
discountenance
rebellion
in
a
neighboring
nation
mazarin
as
a
statesman
will
understand
the
politic
are
you
sure
said
the
queen
doubtfully
that
you
have
not
been
forestalled
by
whom
by
the
joices
the
prinns
the
cromwells
by
a
tailor
a
coachmaker
a
brewer
ah
i
hope
madame
that
the
cardinal
will
not
enter
into
negotiations
with
such
men
ah
what
is
he
himself
asked
madame
henrietta
but
for
the
honor
of
the
king
of
the
well
let
us
hope
he
will
do
something
for
the
sake
of
their
honor
said
the
queen
a
true
friend
s
eloquence
is
so
powerful
my
lord
that
you
have
reassured
me
give
me
your
hand
and
let
us
go
to
the
minister
and
yet
she
added
suppose
he
should
refuse
and
that
the
king
loses
the
battle
his
majesty
will
then
take
refuge
in
holland
where
i
hear
his
highness
the
prince
of
wales
now
and
can
his
majesty
count
upon
many
such
subjects
as
yourself
for
his
flight
alas
no
madame
answered
de
winter
but
the
case
is
provided
for
and
i
am
come
to
france
to
seek
allies
said
the
queen
shaking
her
head
madame
replied
de
winter
provided
i
can
find
some
of
my
good
old
friends
of
former
times
i
will
answer
for
come
then
my
lord
said
the
queen
with
the
painful
doubt
that
is
felt
by
those
who
have
suffered
much
come
and
may
heaven
hear
cromwell
s
letter
at
the
very
moment
when
the
queen
quitted
the
convent
to
go
to
the
palais
royal
a
young
man
dismounted
at
the
gate
of
this
royal
abode
and
announced
to
the
guards
that
he
had
something
of
importance
to
communicate
to
cardinal
mazarin
although
the
cardinal
was
often
tormented
by
fear
he
was
more
often
in
need
of
counsel
and
information
and
he
was
therefore
sufficiently
accessible
the
true
difficulty
of
being
admitted
was
not
to
be
found
at
the
first
door
and
even
the
second
was
passed
easily
enough
but
at
the
third
watched
besides
the
guard
and
the
doorkeepers
the
faithful
bernouin
a
cerberus
whom
no
speech
could
soften
no
wand
even
of
gold
could
charm
it
was
therefore
at
the
third
door
that
those
who
solicited
or
were
bidden
to
an
audience
underwent
their
formal
interrogatory
the
young
man
having
left
his
horse
tied
to
the
gate
in
the
court
mounted
the
great
staircase
and
addressed
the
guard
in
the
first
chamber
cardinal
mazarin
said
he
pass
on
replied
the
guard
the
cavalier
entered
the
second
hall
which
was
guarded
by
the
musketeers
and
doorkeepers
have
you
a
letter
of
audience
asked
a
porter
advancing
to
the
new
arrival
i
have
one
but
not
one
from
cardinal
enter
and
ask
for
monsieur
bernouin
said
the
porter
opening
the
door
of
the
third
room
whether
he
only
held
his
usual
post
or
whether
it
was
by
accident
monsieur
bernouin
was
found
standing
behind
the
door
and
must
have
heard
all
that
had
passed
you
seek
me
sir
said
he
from
whom
may
the
letter
be
you
bear
to
his
eminence
from
general
oliver
cromwell
said
the
new
comer
be
so
good
as
to
mention
this
name
to
his
eminence
and
to
bring
me
word
whether
he
will
receive
me
yes
or
saying
which
he
resumed
the
proud
and
sombre
bearing
peculiar
at
that
time
to
puritans
bernouin
cast
an
inquisitorial
glance
at
the
person
of
the
young
man
and
entered
the
cabinet
of
the
cardinal
to
whom
he
transmitted
the
messenger
s
words
a
man
bringing
a
letter
from
oliver
cromwell
said
mazarin
and
what
kind
of
a
man
a
genuine
englishman
your
eminence
hair
more
red
than
sandy
eyes
more
gray
than
blue
and
for
the
rest
stiff
and
let
him
give
in
his
his
eminence
asks
for
the
letter
said
bernouin
passing
back
into
the
his
eminence
can
not
see
the
letter
without
the
bearer
of
it
replied
the
young
man
but
to
convince
you
that
i
am
really
the
bearer
of
a
letter
see
here
it
is
and
kindly
add
continued
he
that
i
am
not
a
simple
messenger
but
an
envoy
bernouin
the
cabinet
returning
in
a
few
seconds
enter
sir
said
he
the
young
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
of
the
minister
s
closet
in
one
hand
holding
his
hat
in
the
other
the
letter
mazarin
rose
have
you
sir
asked
he
a
letter
accrediting
you
to
me
there
it
is
my
lord
said
the
young
man
mazarin
took
the
letter
and
read
it
thus
mr
mordaunt
one
of
my
secretaries
will
remit
this
letter
of
introduction
to
his
eminence
the
cardinal
mazarin
in
paris
he
is
also
the
bearer
of
a
second
confidential
epistle
for
his
eminence
oliver
very
well
monsieur
mordaunt
said
mazarin
give
me
this
second
letter
and
sit
the
young
man
drew
from
his
pocket
a
second
letter
presented
it
to
the
cardinal
and
took
his
seat
the
cardinal
however
did
not
unseal
the
letter
at
once
but
continued
to
turn
it
again
and
again
in
his
hand
then
in
accordance
with
his
usual
custom
and
judging
from
experience
that
few
people
could
hide
anything
from
him
when
he
began
to
question
them
fixing
his
eyes
upon
them
at
the
same
time
he
thus
addressed
the
messenger
you
are
very
young
monsieur
mordaunt
for
this
difficult
task
of
ambassador
in
which
the
oldest
diplomatists
often
my
lord
i
am
years
of
age
but
your
eminence
is
mistaken
in
saying
that
i
am
young
i
am
older
than
your
eminence
although
i
possess
not
your
wisdom
years
of
suffering
in
my
opinion
count
double
and
i
have
suffered
for
twenty
ah
yes
i
understand
said
mazarin
want
of
fortune
perhaps
you
are
poor
are
you
not
then
he
added
to
himself
these
english
revolutionists
are
all
beggars
and
my
lord
i
ought
to
have
a
fortune
of
six
millions
but
it
has
been
taken
from
you
are
not
then
a
man
of
the
people
said
mazarin
astonished
if
i
bore
my
proper
title
i
should
be
a
lord
if
i
bore
my
name
you
would
have
heard
one
of
the
most
illustrious
names
of
what
is
your
name
then
asked
mazarin
my
name
is
mordaunt
replied
the
young
man
bowing
mazarin
now
understood
that
cromwell
s
envoy
desired
to
retain
his
incognito
he
was
silent
for
an
instant
and
during
that
time
he
scanned
the
young
man
even
more
attentively
than
he
had
done
at
first
the
messenger
was
unmoved
devil
take
these
puritans
said
mazarin
aside
they
are
carved
from
then
he
added
aloud
but
you
have
relations
left
you
i
have
one
remaining
three
times
i
presented
myself
to
ask
his
support
and
three
times
he
ordered
his
servants
to
turn
me
oh
mon
dieu
my
dear
mordaunt
said
mazarin
hoping
by
a
display
of
affected
pity
to
catch
the
young
man
in
a
snare
how
extremely
your
history
interests
me
you
know
not
then
anything
of
your
birth
you
have
never
seen
your
mother
yes
my
lord
she
came
three
times
whilst
i
was
a
child
to
my
nurse
s
house
i
remember
the
last
time
she
came
as
well
as
if
it
were
you
have
a
good
memory
said
mazarin
oh
yes
my
lord
said
the
young
man
with
such
peculiar
emphasis
that
the
cardinal
felt
a
shudder
run
through
every
vein
and
who
brought
you
up
he
asked
again
a
french
nurse
who
sent
me
away
when
i
was
five
years
old
because
no
one
paid
her
for
me
telling
me
the
name
of
a
relation
of
whom
she
had
heard
my
mother
often
what
became
of
you
as
i
was
weeping
and
begging
on
the
high
road
a
minister
from
kingston
took
me
in
instructed
me
in
the
calvinistic
faith
taught
me
all
he
knew
himself
and
aided
me
in
my
researches
after
my
and
these
researches
were
fruitless
chance
did
you
discovered
what
had
become
of
your
mother
i
learned
that
she
had
been
assassinated
by
my
relation
aided
by
four
friends
but
i
was
already
aware
that
i
had
been
robbed
of
my
wealth
and
degraded
from
my
nobility
by
king
charles
oh
i
now
understand
why
you
are
in
the
service
of
cromwell
you
hate
the
yes
my
lord
i
hate
him
said
the
young
man
mazarin
marked
with
surprise
the
diabolical
expression
with
which
the
young
man
uttered
these
words
just
as
ordinarily
faces
are
colored
by
blood
his
face
seemed
dyed
by
hatred
and
became
livid
your
history
is
a
terrible
one
mordaunt
and
touches
me
keenly
but
happily
for
you
you
serve
an
master
he
ought
to
aid
you
in
your
search
we
have
so
many
means
of
gaining
my
lord
to
a
dog
it
is
only
necessary
to
show
one
end
of
a
track
he
is
certain
to
reach
the
but
this
relation
you
mentioned
do
you
wish
me
to
speak
to
him
said
mazarin
who
was
anxious
to
make
a
friend
about
cromwell
s
person
thanks
my
lord
i
will
speak
to
him
myself
he
will
treat
me
better
the
next
time
i
see
you
have
the
means
then
of
touching
him
i
have
the
means
of
making
myself
mazarin
looked
at
the
young
man
but
at
the
fire
which
shot
from
his
glance
he
bent
his
head
then
embarrassed
how
to
continue
such
a
conversation
he
opened
cromwell
s
letter
the
young
man
s
eyes
gradually
resumed
their
dull
and
glassy
appearance
and
he
fell
into
a
profound
reverie
after
reading
the
first
lines
of
the
letter
mazarin
gave
a
side
glance
at
him
to
see
if
he
was
watching
the
expression
of
his
face
as
he
read
observing
his
indifference
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
saying
send
on
your
business
those
who
do
theirs
at
the
same
time
let
us
see
what
this
letter
we
here
present
the
letter
verbatim
to
his
eminence
monseigneur
le
cardinal
mazarini
i
have
wished
monseigneur
to
learn
your
intentions
relating
to
the
existing
state
of
affairs
in
england
the
two
kingdoms
are
so
near
that
france
must
be
interested
in
our
situation
as
we
are
interested
in
that
of
france
the
english
are
almost
of
one
mind
in
contending
against
the
tyranny
of
charles
and
his
adherents
placed
by
popular
confidence
at
the
head
of
that
movement
i
can
appreciate
better
than
any
other
its
significance
and
its
probable
results
i
am
at
present
in
the
midst
of
war
and
am
about
to
deliver
a
decisive
battle
against
king
charles
i
shall
gain
it
for
the
hope
of
the
nation
and
the
spirit
of
the
lord
are
with
me
this
battle
won
by
me
the
king
will
have
no
further
resources
in
england
or
in
scotland
and
if
he
is
not
captured
or
killed
he
will
endeavor
to
pass
over
into
france
to
recruit
soldiers
and
to
refurnish
himself
with
arms
and
money
france
has
already
received
queen
henrietta
and
unintentionally
doubtless
has
maintained
a
centre
of
inextinguishable
civil
war
in
my
country
but
madame
henrietta
is
a
daughter
of
france
and
was
entitled
to
the
hospitality
of
france
as
to
king
charles
the
question
must
be
viewed
differently
in
receiving
and
aiding
him
france
will
censure
the
acts
of
the
english
nation
and
thus
so
essentially
harm
england
and
especially
the
of
the
government
that
such
a
proceeding
will
be
equivalent
to
pronounced
at
this
moment
mazarin
became
very
uneasy
at
the
turn
which
the
letter
was
taking
and
paused
to
glance
under
his
eyes
at
the
young
man
the
latter
continued
in
thought
mazarin
resumed
his
reading
it
is
important
therefore
monseigneur
that
i
should
be
informed
as
to
the
intentions
of
france
the
interests
of
that
kingdom
and
those
of
england
though
taking
now
diverse
directions
are
very
nearly
the
same
england
needs
tranquillity
at
home
in
order
to
consummate
the
expulsion
of
her
king
france
needs
tranquillity
to
establish
on
solid
foundations
the
throne
of
her
young
monarch
you
need
as
much
as
we
do
that
interior
condition
of
repose
which
thanks
to
the
energy
of
our
government
we
are
about
to
attain
your
quarrels
with
the
parliament
your
noisy
dissensions
with
the
princes
who
fight
for
you
and
will
fight
against
you
the
popular
following
directed
by
the
coadjutor
president
blancmesnil
and
councillor
broussel
all
that
disorder
in
short
which
pervades
the
several
departments
of
the
state
must
lead
you
to
view
with
uneasiness
the
possibility
of
a
foreign
war
for
in
that
event
england
exalted
by
the
enthusiasm
of
new
ideas
will
ally
herself
with
spain
already
seeking
that
alliance
i
have
therefore
believed
monseigneur
knowing
your
prudence
and
your
personal
relation
to
the
events
of
the
present
time
that
you
will
choose
to
hold
your
forces
concentrated
in
the
interior
of
the
french
kingdom
and
leave
to
her
own
the
new
government
of
england
that
neutrality
consists
simply
in
excluding
king
charles
from
the
territory
of
france
and
in
refraining
from
helping
him
a
stranger
to
your
country
with
arms
with
money
or
with
troops
my
letter
is
private
and
confidential
and
for
that
reason
i
send
it
to
you
by
a
man
who
shares
my
most
intimate
counsels
it
anticipates
through
a
sentiment
which
your
eminence
will
appreciate
measures
to
be
taken
after
the
events
oliver
cromwell
considered
it
more
expedient
to
declare
himself
to
a
mind
as
intelligent
as
mazarin
s
than
to
a
queen
admirable
for
firmness
without
doubt
but
too
much
guided
by
vain
prejudices
of
birth
and
of
divine
right
farewell
monseigneur
should
i
not
receive
a
reply
in
the
space
of
fifteen
days
i
shall
presume
my
letter
will
have
miscarried
oliver
mr
mordaunt
said
the
cardinal
raising
his
voice
as
if
to
arouse
the
dreamer
my
reply
to
this
letter
will
be
more
satisfactory
to
general
cromwell
if
i
am
convinced
that
all
are
ignorant
of
my
having
given
one
go
therefore
and
await
it
at
and
promise
me
to
set
out
i
promise
my
lord
replied
mordaunt
but
how
many
days
does
your
eminence
expect
me
to
await
your
reply
if
you
do
not
receive
it
in
ten
days
you
can
mordaunt
bowed
that
is
not
all
sir
continued
mazarin
your
private
adventures
have
touched
me
to
the
quick
besides
the
letter
from
cromwell
makes
you
an
important
person
as
ambassador
come
tell
me
what
can
i
do
for
you
mordaunt
reflected
a
moment
and
after
some
hesitation
was
about
to
speak
when
bernouin
entered
hastily
and
bending
down
to
the
ear
of
the
cardinal
whispered
my
lord
the
queen
henrietta
maria
accompanied
by
an
english
noble
is
entering
the
palais
royal
at
this
mazarin
made
a
bound
from
his
chair
which
did
not
escape
the
attention
of
the
young
man
and
suppressed
the
confidence
he
was
about
to
make
sir
said
the
cardinal
you
have
heard
me
i
fix
on
boulogne
because
i
presume
that
every
town
in
france
is
indifferent
to
you
if
you
prefer
another
name
it
but
you
can
easily
conceive
that
surrounded
as
i
am
by
influences
i
can
only
muzzle
by
discretion
i
desire
your
presence
in
paris
to
be
i
go
sir
said
mordaunt
advancing
a
few
steps
to
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
no
not
that
way
i
beg
sir
quickly
exclaimed
the
cardinal
be
so
good
as
to
pass
by
yonder
gallery
by
which
you
can
regain
the
hall
i
do
not
wish
you
to
be
seen
leaving
our
interview
must
be
kept
mordaunt
followed
bernouin
who
led
him
through
the
adjacent
chamber
and
left
him
with
a
doorkeeper
showing
him
the
way
out
henrietta
maria
and
mazarin
the
cardinal
rose
and
advanced
in
haste
to
receive
the
queen
of
england
he
showed
the
more
respect
to
this
queen
deprived
of
every
mark
of
pomp
and
stripped
of
followers
as
he
felt
some
for
his
own
want
of
heart
and
his
avarice
but
supplicants
for
favor
know
how
to
accommodate
the
expression
of
their
features
and
the
daughter
of
henry
iv
smiled
as
she
advanced
to
meet
a
man
she
hated
and
despised
ah
said
mazarin
to
himself
what
a
sweet
face
does
she
come
to
borrow
money
of
me
and
he
threw
an
uneasy
glance
at
his
strong
box
he
even
turned
inside
the
bevel
of
the
magnificent
diamond
ring
the
brilliancy
of
which
drew
every
eye
upon
his
hand
which
indeed
was
white
and
handsome
your
eminence
said
the
august
visitor
it
was
my
first
intention
to
speak
of
the
matters
that
have
brought
me
here
to
the
queen
my
sister
but
i
have
reflected
that
political
affairs
are
more
especially
the
concern
of
madame
said
mazarin
your
majesty
overwhelms
me
with
flattering
he
is
very
gracious
thought
the
queen
can
he
have
guessed
my
errand
give
continued
the
cardinal
your
commands
to
the
most
respectful
of
your
alas
sir
replied
the
queen
i
have
lost
the
habit
of
commanding
and
have
adopted
instead
that
of
making
petitions
i
am
here
to
petition
you
too
happy
should
my
prayer
be
favorably
i
am
listening
madame
with
the
greatest
interest
said
mazarin
your
eminence
it
concerns
the
war
which
the
king
my
husband
is
now
sustaining
against
his
rebellious
subjects
you
are
perhaps
ignorant
that
they
are
fighting
in
england
added
she
with
a
melancholy
smile
and
that
in
a
short
time
they
will
fight
in
a
much
more
decided
fashion
than
they
have
done
i
am
completely
ignorant
of
it
madame
said
the
cardinal
accompanying
his
words
with
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
alas
our
own
wars
quite
absorb
the
time
and
the
mind
of
a
poor
incapable
infirm
old
minister
like
well
then
your
eminence
said
the
queen
i
must
inform
you
that
charles
my
husband
is
on
the
eve
of
a
decisive
engagement
in
case
of
a
check
mazarin
made
a
slight
movement
one
must
foresee
everything
in
the
case
of
a
check
he
desires
to
retire
into
france
and
to
live
here
as
a
private
individual
what
do
you
say
to
this
project
the
cardinal
had
listened
without
permitting
a
single
fibre
of
his
face
to
betray
what
he
felt
and
his
smile
remained
as
it
ever
was
false
and
flattering
and
when
the
queen
finished
speaking
he
said
do
you
think
madame
that
france
agitated
and
disturbed
as
it
is
would
be
a
safe
retreat
for
a
dethroned
king
how
will
the
crown
which
is
scarce
firmly
set
on
the
head
of
louis
support
a
double
weight
the
weight
was
not
so
heavy
when
i
was
in
peril
interrupted
the
queen
with
a
sad
smile
and
i
ask
no
more
for
my
husband
than
has
been
done
for
me
you
see
that
we
are
very
humble
monarchs
oh
you
madame
the
cardinal
hastened
to
say
in
order
to
cut
short
the
explanation
he
foresaw
was
coming
with
regard
to
you
that
is
another
thing
a
daughter
of
henry
of
that
great
that
sublime
sovereign
all
which
does
not
prevent
you
refusing
hospitality
to
his
sir
nevertheless
you
ought
to
remember
that
that
great
that
sublime
monarch
when
proscribed
at
one
time
as
my
husband
may
be
demanded
aid
from
england
and
england
accorded
it
to
him
and
it
is
but
just
to
say
that
queen
elizabeth
was
not
his
peccato
said
mazarin
writhing
beneath
this
simple
eloquence
your
majesty
does
not
understand
me
you
judge
my
intentions
wrongly
and
that
is
partly
because
doubtless
i
explain
myself
in
speak
italian
sir
ere
the
cardinal
your
predecessor
sent
our
mother
marie
de
medicis
to
die
in
exile
she
taught
us
that
language
if
anything
yet
remains
of
that
great
that
sublime
king
henry
of
whom
you
have
just
spoken
he
would
be
much
surprised
at
so
little
pity
for
his
family
being
united
to
such
a
profound
admiration
of
the
perspiration
stood
in
large
drops
on
mazarin
s
brow
that
admiration
is
on
the
contrary
so
great
so
real
madame
returned
mazarin
without
noticing
the
change
of
language
offered
to
him
by
the
queen
that
if
the
king
charles
whom
heaven
protect
from
evil
came
into
france
i
would
offer
him
my
house
my
own
house
but
alas
it
would
be
but
an
unsafe
retreat
some
day
the
people
will
burn
that
house
as
they
burned
that
of
the
marechal
d
ancre
poor
concino
concini
and
yet
he
but
desired
the
good
of
the
yes
my
lord
like
yourself
said
the
queen
ironically
mazarin
pretended
not
to
understand
the
double
meaning
of
his
own
sentence
but
continued
to
compassionate
the
fate
of
concino
concini
well
then
your
eminence
said
the
queen
becoming
impatient
what
is
your
answer
madame
cried
mazarin
more
and
more
moved
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
give
you
counsel
speak
sir
replied
the
queen
the
counsels
of
so
prudent
a
man
as
yourself
ought
certainly
to
be
madame
believe
me
the
king
ought
to
defend
himself
to
the
he
has
done
so
sir
and
this
last
battle
which
he
encounters
with
resources
much
inferior
to
those
of
the
enemy
proves
that
he
will
not
yield
without
a
struggle
but
in
case
he
is
beaten
well
madame
in
that
case
my
advice
i
know
that
i
am
very
bold
to
offer
advice
to
your
majesty
my
advice
is
that
the
king
should
not
leave
his
kingdom
absent
kings
are
very
soon
forgotten
if
he
passes
over
into
france
his
cause
is
but
persisted
the
queen
if
such
be
your
advice
and
you
have
his
interest
at
heart
send
him
help
of
men
and
money
for
i
can
do
nothing
for
him
i
have
sold
even
to
my
last
diamond
to
aid
him
if
i
had
had
a
single
ornament
left
i
should
have
bought
wood
this
winter
to
make
a
fire
for
my
daughter
and
oh
madame
said
mazarin
your
majesty
knows
not
what
you
ask
on
the
day
when
foreign
succor
follows
in
the
train
of
a
king
to
replace
him
on
his
throne
it
is
an
avowal
that
he
no
longer
possesses
the
help
and
love
of
his
own
to
the
point
sir
said
the
queen
to
the
point
and
answer
me
yes
or
no
if
the
king
persists
in
remaining
in
england
will
you
send
him
succor
if
he
comes
to
france
will
you
accord
him
hospitality
what
do
you
intend
to
do
madame
said
the
cardinal
affecting
an
effusive
frankness
of
speech
i
shall
convince
your
majesty
i
trust
of
my
devotion
to
you
and
my
desire
to
terminate
an
affair
which
you
have
so
much
at
heart
after
which
your
majesty
will
i
think
no
longer
doubt
my
zeal
in
your
the
queen
bit
her
lips
and
moved
impatiently
on
her
chair
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
she
said
at
length
come
i
will
go
this
instant
and
consult
the
queen
and
we
will
refer
the
affair
at
once
to
with
which
you
are
at
war
is
it
not
so
you
will
charge
broussel
to
report
it
enough
sir
enough
i
understand
you
or
rather
i
am
wrong
go
to
the
parliament
for
it
was
from
this
parliament
the
enemy
of
monarchs
that
the
daughter
of
the
great
the
sublime
henry
whom
you
so
much
admire
received
the
only
relief
this
winter
which
prevented
her
from
dying
of
hunger
and
cold
and
with
these
words
henrietta
rose
in
majestic
indignation
whilst
the
cardinal
raising
his
hands
clasped
toward
her
exclaimed
ah
madame
madame
how
little
you
know
me
mon
dieu
but
queen
henrietta
without
even
turning
toward
him
who
made
these
hypocritical
pretensions
crossed
the
cabinet
opened
the
door
for
herself
and
passing
through
the
midst
of
the
cardinal
s
numerous
guards
courtiers
eager
to
pay
homage
the
luxurious
show
of
a
competing
royalty
she
went
and
took
the
hand
of
de
winter
who
stood
apart
in
isolation
poor
queen
already
fallen
though
all
bowed
before
her
as
etiquette
required
she
had
now
but
a
single
arm
on
which
she
could
lean
it
signifies
little
said
mazarin
when
he
was
alone
it
gave
me
pain
and
it
was
an
ungracious
part
to
play
but
i
have
said
nothing
either
to
the
one
or
to
the
other
bernouin
bernouin
entered
see
if
the
young
man
with
the
black
doublet
and
the
short
hair
who
was
with
me
just
now
is
still
in
the
bernouin
went
out
and
soon
returned
with
comminges
who
was
on
guard
your
eminence
said
comminges
as
i
was
the
young
man
for
whom
you
have
asked
he
approached
the
glass
door
of
the
gallery
and
gazed
intently
upon
some
object
doubtless
the
picture
by
raphael
which
is
opposite
the
door
he
reflected
for
a
second
and
then
descended
the
stairs
i
believe
i
saw
him
mount
a
gray
horse
and
leave
the
palace
court
but
is
not
your
eminence
going
to
the
queen
for
what
purpose
monsieur
de
guitant
my
uncle
has
just
told
me
that
her
majesty
had
received
news
of
the
it
is
well
i
will
comminges
had
seen
rightly
and
mordaunt
had
really
acted
as
he
had
related
in
crossing
the
gallery
parallel
to
the
large
glass
gallery
he
perceived
de
winter
who
was
waiting
until
the
queen
had
finished
her
negotiation
at
this
sight
the
young
man
stopped
short
not
in
admiration
of
raphael
s
picture
but
as
if
fascinated
at
the
sight
of
some
terrible
object
his
eyes
dilated
and
a
shudder
ran
through
his
body
one
would
have
said
that
he
longed
to
break
through
the
wall
of
glass
which
separated
him
from
his
enemy
for
if
comminges
had
seen
with
what
an
expression
of
hatred
the
eyes
of
this
young
man
were
fixed
upon
de
winter
he
would
not
have
doubted
for
an
instant
that
the
englishman
was
his
eternal
foe
but
he
stopped
doubtless
to
reflect
for
instead
of
allowing
his
first
impulse
which
had
been
to
go
straight
to
lord
de
winter
to
carry
him
away
he
leisurely
descended
the
staircase
left
the
palace
with
his
head
down
mounted
his
horse
which
he
reined
in
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
richelieu
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
gate
waited
until
the
queen
s
carriage
had
left
the
court
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
the
queen
scarcely
remained
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
mazarin
but
this
quarter
of
an
hour
of
expectation
appeared
a
century
to
him
at
last
the
heavy
machine
which
was
called
a
chariot
in
those
days
came
out
rumbling
against
the
gates
and
de
winter
still
on
horseback
bent
again
to
the
door
to
converse
with
her
majesty
the
horses
started
on
a
trot
and
took
the
road
to
the
louvre
which
they
entered
before
leaving
the
convent
of
the
carmelites
henrietta
had
desired
her
daughter
to
attend
her
at
the
palace
which
she
had
inhabited
for
a
long
time
and
which
she
had
only
left
because
their
poverty
seemed
to
them
more
difficult
to
bear
in
gilded
chambers
mordaunt
followed
the
carriage
and
when
he
had
watched
it
drive
beneath
the
sombre
arches
he
went
and
stationed
himself
under
a
wall
over
which
the
shadow
was
extended
and
remained
motionless
amidst
the
moldings
of
jean
goujon
like
a
representing
an
equestrian
statue
how
sometimes
the
unhappy
mistake
chance
for
providence
well
madame
said
de
winter
when
the
queen
had
dismissed
her
attendants
well
my
lord
what
i
foresaw
has
come
to
what
does
the
cardinal
refuse
to
receive
the
king
france
refuse
hospitality
to
an
unfortunate
prince
ay
but
it
is
for
the
first
time
madame
i
did
not
say
france
my
lord
i
said
the
cardinal
and
the
cardinal
is
not
even
a
but
did
you
see
the
queen
it
is
useless
replied
henrietta
the
queen
will
not
say
yes
when
the
cardinal
says
no
are
you
not
aware
that
this
italian
directs
everything
both
indoors
and
out
and
moreover
i
should
not
be
surprised
had
we
been
forestalled
by
cromwell
he
was
embarrassed
whilst
speaking
to
me
and
yet
quite
firm
in
his
determination
to
refuse
then
did
you
not
observe
the
agitation
in
the
palais
royal
the
passing
to
and
fro
of
busy
people
can
they
have
received
any
news
my
lord
not
from
england
madame
i
made
such
haste
that
i
am
certain
of
not
having
been
forestalled
i
set
out
three
days
ago
passing
miraculously
through
the
puritan
army
and
i
took
post
horses
with
my
servant
tony
the
horses
upon
which
we
were
mounted
were
bought
in
paris
besides
the
king
i
am
certain
awaits
your
majesty
s
reply
before
risking
you
will
tell
him
my
lord
resumed
the
queen
despairingly
that
i
can
do
nothing
that
i
have
suffered
as
much
as
himself
more
than
he
has
obliged
as
i
am
to
eat
the
bread
of
exile
and
to
ask
hospitality
from
false
friends
who
smile
at
my
tears
and
as
regards
his
royal
person
he
must
sacrifice
it
generously
and
die
like
a
king
i
shall
go
and
die
by
his
madame
madame
exclaimed
de
winter
your
majesty
abandons
yourself
to
despair
and
yet
perhaps
there
still
remains
some
no
friends
left
my
lord
no
other
friends
left
in
the
wide
world
but
yourself
oh
god
exclaimed
the
poor
queen
raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
have
you
indeed
taken
back
all
the
generous
hearts
that
once
existed
in
the
world
i
hope
not
madame
replied
de
winter
thoughtfully
i
once
spoke
to
you
of
four
what
can
be
done
with
four
four
devoted
resolute
men
can
do
much
assure
yourself
madame
and
those
of
whom
i
speak
performed
great
things
at
one
and
where
are
these
four
men
ah
that
is
what
i
do
not
know
it
is
twenty
years
since
i
saw
them
and
yet
whenever
i
have
seen
the
king
in
danger
i
have
thought
of
and
these
men
were
your
friends
one
of
them
held
my
life
in
his
hands
and
gave
it
to
me
i
know
not
whether
he
is
still
my
friend
but
since
that
time
i
have
remained
and
these
men
are
in
france
my
lord
i
believe
tell
me
their
names
perhaps
i
may
have
heard
them
mentioned
and
might
be
able
to
aid
you
in
finding
one
of
them
was
called
the
chevalier
d
ah
my
lord
if
i
mistake
not
the
chevalier
d
artagnan
is
lieutenant
of
royal
guards
but
take
care
for
i
fear
that
this
man
is
entirely
devoted
to
the
that
would
be
a
misfortune
said
de
winter
and
i
shall
begin
to
think
that
we
are
really
but
the
others
said
the
queen
who
clung
to
this
last
hope
as
a
shipwrecked
man
clings
to
the
hull
of
his
vessel
the
others
my
lord
the
second
i
heard
his
name
by
chance
for
before
fighting
us
these
four
gentlemen
told
us
their
names
the
second
was
called
the
comte
de
la
fere
as
for
the
two
others
i
had
so
much
the
habit
of
calling
them
by
nicknames
that
i
have
forgotten
their
real
oh
mon
dieu
it
is
a
matter
of
the
greatest
urgency
to
find
them
out
said
the
queen
since
you
think
these
worthy
gentlemen
might
be
so
useful
to
the
oh
yes
said
de
winter
for
they
are
the
same
men
listen
madame
and
recall
your
remembrances
have
you
never
heard
that
queen
anne
of
austria
was
once
saved
from
the
greatest
danger
ever
incurred
by
a
queen
yes
at
the
time
of
her
relations
with
monsieur
de
buckingham
it
had
to
do
in
some
way
with
certain
studs
and
well
it
was
that
affair
madame
these
men
are
the
ones
who
saved
her
and
i
smile
with
pity
when
i
reflect
that
if
the
names
of
those
gentlemen
are
unknown
to
you
it
is
because
the
queen
has
forgotten
them
who
ought
to
have
made
them
the
first
noblemen
of
the
well
then
my
lord
they
must
be
found
but
what
can
four
men
or
rather
three
men
do
for
i
tell
you
you
must
not
count
on
monsieur
d
it
will
be
one
valiant
sword
the
less
but
there
will
remain
still
three
without
reckoning
my
own
now
four
devoted
men
around
the
king
to
protect
him
from
his
enemies
to
be
at
his
side
in
battle
to
aid
him
with
counsel
to
escort
him
in
flight
are
sufficient
not
to
make
the
king
a
conqueror
but
to
save
him
if
conquered
and
whatever
mazarin
may
say
once
on
the
shores
of
france
your
royal
husband
may
find
as
many
retreats
and
asylums
as
the
seabird
finds
in
a
seek
then
my
lord
seek
these
gentlemen
and
if
they
will
consent
to
go
with
you
to
england
i
will
give
to
each
a
duchy
the
day
that
we
reascend
the
throne
besides
as
much
gold
as
would
pave
whitehall
seek
them
my
lord
and
find
them
i
conjure
i
will
search
for
them
madame
said
de
winter
and
doubtless
i
shall
find
them
but
time
fails
me
has
your
majesty
forgotten
that
the
king
expects
your
reply
and
awaits
it
in
agony
then
indeed
we
are
lost
cried
the
queen
in
the
fullness
of
a
broken
heart
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
young
henrietta
appeared
then
the
queen
with
that
wonderful
strength
which
is
the
privilege
of
parents
repressed
her
tears
and
motioned
to
de
winter
to
change
the
subject
but
that
act
of
effective
as
it
was
did
not
escape
the
eyes
of
the
young
princess
she
stopped
on
the
threshold
breathed
a
sigh
and
addressing
the
queen
why
then
do
you
always
weep
mother
when
i
am
away
from
you
she
said
the
queen
smiled
but
instead
of
answering
see
de
winter
she
said
i
have
at
least
gained
one
thing
in
being
only
half
a
queen
and
that
is
that
my
children
call
me
mother
instead
of
then
turning
toward
her
daughter
what
do
you
want
henrietta
she
demanded
my
mother
replied
the
young
princess
a
cavalier
has
just
entered
the
louvre
and
wishes
to
present
his
respects
to
your
majesty
he
arrives
from
the
army
and
has
he
says
a
letter
to
remit
to
you
on
the
part
of
the
marechal
de
grammont
i
ah
said
the
queen
to
de
winter
he
is
one
of
my
faithful
adherents
but
do
you
not
observe
my
dear
lord
that
we
are
so
poorly
served
that
it
is
left
to
my
daughter
to
fill
the
office
of
doorkeeper
madame
have
pity
on
me
exclaimed
de
winter
you
wring
my
heart
and
who
is
this
cavalier
henrietta
asked
the
queen
i
saw
him
from
the
window
madame
he
is
a
young
man
that
appears
scarce
sixteen
years
of
age
and
is
called
the
viscount
de
the
queen
smiling
made
a
sign
with
her
head
the
young
princess
opened
the
door
and
raoul
appeared
on
the
threshold
advancing
a
few
steps
toward
the
queen
he
knelt
down
madame
said
he
i
bear
to
your
majesty
a
letter
from
my
friend
the
count
de
guiche
who
told
me
he
had
the
honor
of
being
your
servant
this
letter
contains
important
news
and
the
expression
of
his
at
the
name
of
the
count
de
guiche
a
blush
spread
over
the
cheeks
of
the
young
princess
and
the
queen
glanced
at
her
with
some
degree
of
severity
you
told
me
that
the
letter
was
from
the
marechal
de
grammont
henrietta
said
the
queen
i
thought
so
madame
stammered
the
young
girl
it
is
my
fault
madame
said
raoul
i
did
announce
myself
in
truth
as
coming
on
the
part
of
the
marechal
de
grammont
but
being
wounded
in
the
right
arm
he
was
unable
to
write
and
therefore
the
count
de
guiche
acted
as
his
there
has
been
fighting
then
asked
the
queen
motioning
to
raoul
to
rise
yes
madame
said
the
young
man
at
this
announcement
of
a
battle
having
taken
place
the
princess
opened
her
mouth
as
though
to
ask
a
question
of
interest
but
her
lips
closed
again
without
articulating
a
word
while
the
color
gradually
faded
from
her
cheeks
the
queen
saw
this
and
doubtless
her
maternal
heart
translated
the
emotion
for
addressing
raoul
again
and
no
evil
has
happened
to
the
young
count
de
guiche
she
asked
for
not
only
is
he
our
servant
as
you
say
sir
but
more
he
is
one
of
our
no
madame
replied
raoul
on
the
contrary
he
gained
great
glory
and
had
the
honor
of
being
embraced
by
his
highness
the
prince
on
the
field
of
the
young
princess
clapped
her
hands
and
then
ashamed
of
having
been
betrayed
into
such
a
demonstration
of
joy
she
half
turned
away
and
bent
over
a
vase
of
roses
as
if
to
inhale
their
odor
let
us
see
said
the
queen
what
the
count
and
she
opened
the
letter
and
read
madame
being
unable
to
have
the
honor
of
writing
to
you
myself
by
reason
of
a
wound
i
have
received
in
my
right
hand
i
have
commanded
my
son
the
count
de
guiche
who
with
his
father
is
equally
your
humble
servant
to
write
to
tell
you
that
we
have
just
gained
the
battle
of
lens
and
that
this
victory
can
not
fail
to
give
great
power
to
cardinal
mazarin
and
to
the
queen
over
the
affairs
of
europe
if
her
majesty
will
have
faith
in
my
counsels
she
ought
to
profit
by
this
event
to
address
at
this
moment
in
favor
of
her
august
husband
the
court
of
france
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
who
will
have
the
honor
of
remitting
this
letter
to
your
majesty
is
the
friend
of
my
son
who
owes
to
him
his
life
he
is
a
gentleman
in
whom
your
majesty
may
confide
entirely
in
case
your
majesty
may
have
some
verbal
or
written
order
to
remit
to
me
i
have
the
honor
to
be
with
respect
marechal
de
at
the
moment
mention
occurred
of
his
having
rendered
a
service
to
the
count
raoul
could
not
help
turning
his
glance
toward
the
young
princess
and
then
he
saw
in
her
eyes
an
expression
of
infinite
gratitude
to
the
young
man
he
no
longer
doubted
that
the
daughter
of
king
charles
loved
his
friend
the
battle
of
lens
gained
said
the
queen
they
are
lucky
here
indeed
they
can
gain
battles
yes
the
marechal
de
grammont
is
right
this
will
change
the
aspect
of
french
affairs
but
i
much
fear
it
will
do
nothing
for
english
even
if
it
does
not
harm
them
this
is
recent
news
sir
continued
she
and
i
thank
you
for
having
made
such
haste
to
bring
it
to
me
without
this
letter
i
should
not
have
heard
till
perhaps
after
the
last
of
all
madame
said
raoul
the
louvre
is
but
the
second
palace
this
news
has
reached
it
is
as
yet
unknown
to
all
and
i
had
sworn
to
the
count
de
guiche
to
remit
this
letter
to
your
majesty
before
even
i
should
embrace
my
your
guardian
is
he
too
a
bragelonne
asked
lord
de
winter
i
once
knew
a
bragelonne
is
he
still
alive
no
sir
he
is
dead
and
i
believe
it
is
from
him
my
guardian
whose
near
relation
he
was
inherited
the
estate
from
which
i
take
my
and
your
guardian
sir
asked
the
queen
who
could
not
help
feeling
some
interest
in
the
handsome
young
man
before
her
what
is
his
name
the
comte
de
la
fere
madame
replied
the
young
man
bowing
de
winter
made
a
gesture
of
surprise
and
the
queen
turned
to
him
with
a
start
of
joy
the
comte
de
la
fere
she
cried
have
you
not
mentioned
that
name
to
me
as
for
de
winter
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
he
had
heard
aright
the
comte
de
la
fere
he
cried
in
his
turn
oh
sir
reply
i
entreat
you
is
not
the
comte
de
la
fere
a
noble
whom
i
remember
handsome
and
brave
a
musketeer
under
louis
who
must
be
now
about
or
years
of
age
yes
sir
you
are
right
in
every
particular
and
who
served
under
an
assumed
name
under
the
name
of
athos
latterly
i
heard
his
friend
monsieur
d
artagnan
give
him
that
that
is
it
madame
that
is
the
same
god
be
praised
and
he
is
in
paris
continued
he
addressing
raoul
then
turning
to
the
queen
we
may
still
hope
providence
has
declared
for
us
since
i
have
found
this
brave
man
again
in
so
miraculous
a
manner
and
sir
where
does
he
reside
pray
the
comte
de
la
fere
lodges
in
the
rue
guenegaud
hotel
du
grand
roi
thanks
sir
inform
this
dear
friend
that
he
may
remain
within
that
i
shall
go
and
see
him
sir
i
obey
with
pleasure
if
her
majesty
will
permit
me
to
go
monsieur
de
bragelonne
said
the
queen
and
rest
assured
of
our
raoul
bent
respectfully
before
the
two
princesses
and
bowing
to
de
winter
departed
the
queen
and
de
winter
continued
to
converse
for
some
time
in
low
voices
in
order
that
the
young
princess
should
not
overhear
them
but
the
precaution
was
needless
she
was
in
deep
converse
with
her
own
thoughts
then
when
de
winter
rose
to
take
leave
listen
my
lord
said
the
queen
i
have
preserved
this
diamond
cross
which
came
from
my
mother
and
this
order
of
michael
which
came
from
my
husband
they
are
worth
about
fifty
thousand
pounds
i
had
sworn
to
die
of
hunger
rather
than
part
with
these
precious
pledges
but
now
that
this
ornament
may
be
useful
to
him
or
his
defenders
everything
must
be
sacrificed
take
them
and
if
you
need
money
for
your
expedition
sell
them
fearlessly
my
lord
but
should
you
find
the
means
of
retaining
them
remember
my
lord
that
i
shall
esteem
you
as
having
rendered
the
greatest
service
that
a
gentleman
can
render
to
a
queen
and
in
the
day
of
my
prosperity
he
who
brings
me
this
order
and
this
cross
shall
be
blessed
by
me
and
my
madame
replied
de
winter
your
majesty
will
be
served
by
a
man
devoted
to
you
i
hasten
to
deposit
these
two
objects
in
a
safe
place
nor
should
i
accept
them
if
the
resources
of
our
ancient
fortune
were
left
to
us
but
our
estates
are
confiscated
our
ready
money
is
exhausted
and
we
are
reduced
to
turn
to
service
everything
we
possess
in
an
hour
hence
i
shall
be
with
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
your
majesty
shall
have
a
definite
the
queen
tendered
her
hand
to
lord
de
winter
who
kissing
it
respectfully
went
out
and
traversed
alone
and
unconducted
those
large
dark
and
deserted
apartments
brushing
away
tears
which
blase
as
he
was
by
fifty
years
spent
as
a
courtier
he
could
not
withhold
at
the
spectacle
of
royal
distress
so
dignified
yet
so
intense
uncle
and
nephew
the
horse
and
servant
belonging
to
de
winter
were
waiting
for
him
at
the
door
he
proceeded
toward
his
abode
very
thoughtfully
looking
behind
him
from
time
to
him
to
contemplate
the
dark
and
silent
frontage
of
the
louvre
it
was
then
that
he
saw
a
horseman
as
it
were
detach
himself
from
the
wall
and
follow
him
at
a
little
distance
in
leaving
the
palais
royal
he
remembered
to
have
observed
a
similar
shadow
tony
he
said
motioning
to
his
groom
to
approach
here
i
am
my
did
you
remark
that
man
who
is
following
us
yes
my
who
is
he
i
do
not
know
only
he
has
followed
your
grace
from
the
palais
royal
stopped
at
the
louvre
to
wait
for
you
and
now
leaves
the
louvre
with
some
spy
of
the
cardinal
said
de
winter
to
him
aside
let
us
pretend
not
to
notice
that
he
is
watching
and
spurring
on
he
plunged
into
the
labyrinth
of
streets
which
led
to
his
hotel
situated
near
the
marais
for
having
for
so
long
a
time
lived
near
the
place
royale
lord
de
winter
naturally
returned
to
lodge
near
his
ancient
dwelling
the
unknown
spurred
his
horse
to
a
gallop
de
winter
dismounted
at
his
hotel
and
went
up
into
his
apartment
intending
to
watch
the
spy
but
as
he
was
about
to
place
his
gloves
and
hat
on
a
table
he
saw
reflected
in
a
glass
opposite
to
him
a
figure
which
stood
on
the
threshold
of
the
room
he
turned
around
and
mordaunt
stood
before
him
there
was
a
moment
of
frozen
silence
between
these
two
sir
said
de
winter
i
thought
i
had
already
made
you
aware
that
i
am
weary
of
this
persecution
withdraw
then
or
i
shall
call
and
have
you
turned
out
as
you
were
in
london
i
am
not
your
uncle
i
know
you
my
uncle
replied
mordaunt
with
his
harsh
and
bantering
tone
you
are
mistaken
you
will
not
have
me
turned
out
this
time
as
you
did
in
london
you
dare
not
as
for
denying
that
i
am
your
nephew
you
will
think
twice
about
it
now
that
i
have
learned
some
things
of
which
i
was
ignorant
a
year
and
how
does
it
concern
me
what
you
have
learned
said
de
winter
oh
it
concerns
you
very
closely
my
uncle
i
am
sure
and
you
will
soon
be
of
my
opinion
added
he
with
a
smile
which
sent
a
shudder
through
the
veins
of
him
he
thus
addressed
when
i
presented
myself
before
you
for
the
first
time
in
london
it
was
to
ask
you
what
had
become
of
my
fortune
the
second
time
it
was
to
demand
who
had
sullied
my
name
and
this
time
i
come
before
you
to
ask
a
question
far
more
terrible
than
any
other
to
say
to
you
as
god
said
to
the
first
murderer
cain
what
hast
thou
done
to
thy
brother
abel
my
lord
what
have
you
done
with
your
sister
your
sister
who
was
my
mother
de
winter
shrank
back
from
the
fire
of
those
scorching
eyes
your
mother
he
said
yes
my
lord
my
mother
replied
the
young
man
advancing
into
the
room
until
he
was
face
to
face
with
lord
de
winter
and
crossing
his
arms
i
have
asked
the
headsman
of
bethune
he
said
his
voice
hoarse
and
his
face
livid
with
passion
and
grief
and
the
headsman
of
bethune
gave
me
a
de
winter
fell
back
in
a
chair
as
though
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
and
in
vain
attempted
a
reply
yes
continued
the
young
man
all
is
now
explained
with
this
key
i
open
the
abyss
my
mother
inherited
an
estate
from
her
husband
you
have
assassinated
her
my
name
would
have
secured
me
the
paternal
estate
you
have
deprived
me
of
it
you
have
despoiled
me
of
my
fortune
i
am
no
longer
astonished
that
you
knew
me
not
i
am
not
surprised
that
you
refused
to
recognize
me
when
a
man
is
a
robber
it
is
hard
to
call
him
nephew
whom
he
has
impoverished
when
one
is
a
murderer
to
recognize
the
man
whom
one
has
made
an
these
words
produced
a
contrary
effect
to
that
which
mordaunt
had
anticipated
de
winter
remembered
the
monster
that
milady
had
been
he
rose
dignified
and
calm
restraining
by
the
severity
of
his
look
the
wild
glance
of
the
young
man
you
desire
to
fathom
this
horrible
secret
said
de
winter
well
then
so
be
it
know
then
what
manner
of
woman
it
was
for
whom
you
call
me
to
account
that
woman
had
in
all
probability
poisoned
my
brother
and
in
order
to
inherit
from
me
she
was
about
to
assassinate
me
in
my
turn
i
have
proof
of
it
what
say
you
to
that
i
say
that
she
was
my
she
caused
the
unfortunate
duke
of
buckingham
to
be
stabbed
by
a
man
who
was
ere
that
honest
good
and
pure
what
say
you
to
that
crime
of
which
i
have
the
proof
she
was
my
on
our
return
to
france
she
had
a
young
woman
who
was
attached
to
one
of
her
opponents
poisoned
in
the
convent
of
the
augustines
at
bethune
will
this
crime
persuade
you
of
the
justice
of
her
punishment
for
of
all
this
i
have
the
proofs
she
was
my
mother
cried
the
young
man
who
uttered
these
three
successive
exclamations
with
constantly
increasing
force
at
last
charged
with
murders
with
debauchery
hated
by
every
one
and
yet
threatening
still
like
a
panther
thirsting
for
blood
she
fell
under
the
blows
of
men
whom
she
had
rendered
desperate
though
they
had
never
done
her
the
least
injury
she
met
with
judges
whom
her
hideous
crimes
had
evoked
and
that
executioner
you
saw
that
executioner
who
you
say
told
you
everything
that
executioner
if
he
told
you
everything
told
you
that
he
leaped
with
joy
in
avenging
on
her
his
brother
s
shame
and
suicide
depraved
as
a
girl
adulterous
as
a
wife
an
unnatural
sister
homicide
poisoner
execrated
by
all
who
knew
her
by
every
nation
that
had
been
visited
by
her
she
died
accursed
by
heaven
and
a
sob
which
mordaunt
could
not
repress
burst
from
his
throat
and
his
livid
face
became
suffused
with
blood
he
clenched
his
fists
sweat
covered
his
face
his
hair
like
hamlet
s
stood
on
end
and
racked
with
fury
he
cried
out
silence
sir
she
was
my
mother
her
crimes
i
know
them
not
her
disorders
i
know
them
not
her
vices
i
know
them
not
but
this
i
know
that
i
had
a
mother
that
five
men
leagued
against
one
woman
murdered
her
clandestinely
by
night
silently
like
cowards
i
know
that
you
were
one
of
them
my
uncle
and
that
you
cried
louder
than
the
others
she
must
therefore
i
warn
you
and
listen
well
to
my
words
that
they
may
be
engraved
upon
your
memory
never
to
be
forgotten
this
murder
which
has
robbed
me
of
everything
this
murder
which
has
deprived
me
of
my
name
this
murder
which
has
impoverished
me
this
murder
which
has
made
me
corrupt
wicked
implacable
i
shall
summon
you
to
account
for
it
first
and
then
those
who
were
your
accomplices
when
i
discover
them
with
hatred
in
his
eyes
foaming
at
his
mouth
and
his
fist
extended
mordaunt
had
advanced
one
more
step
a
threatening
terrible
step
toward
de
winter
the
latter
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
and
said
with
the
smile
of
a
man
who
for
thirty
years
has
jested
with
death
would
you
assassinate
me
sir
then
i
shall
recognize
you
as
my
nephew
for
you
would
be
a
worthy
son
of
such
a
no
replied
mordaunt
forcing
his
features
and
the
muscles
of
his
body
to
resume
their
usual
places
and
be
calm
no
i
shall
not
kill
you
at
least
not
at
this
moment
for
without
you
i
could
not
discover
the
others
but
when
i
have
found
them
then
tremble
sir
i
stabbed
to
the
heart
the
headsman
of
bethune
without
mercy
or
pity
and
he
was
the
least
guilty
of
you
with
these
words
the
young
man
went
out
and
descended
the
stairs
with
sufficient
calmness
to
pass
unobserved
then
upon
the
lowest
landing
place
he
passed
tony
leaning
over
the
balustrade
waiting
only
for
a
call
from
his
master
to
mount
to
his
room
but
de
winter
did
not
call
crushed
enfeebled
he
remained
standing
and
with
listening
ear
then
only
when
he
had
heard
the
step
of
the
horse
going
away
he
fell
back
on
a
chair
saying
my
god
i
thank
thee
that
he
knows
me
paternal
affection
whilst
this
terrible
scene
was
passing
at
lord
de
winter
s
athos
seated
near
his
window
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
head
supported
on
his
hand
was
listening
intently
to
raoul
s
account
of
the
adventures
he
met
with
on
his
journey
and
the
details
of
the
battle
listening
to
the
relation
of
those
emotions
so
fresh
and
pure
the
fine
noble
face
of
athos
betrayed
indescribable
pleasure
he
inhaled
the
tones
of
that
young
voice
as
harmonious
music
he
forgot
all
that
was
dark
in
the
past
and
that
was
cloudy
in
the
future
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
return
of
this
much
loved
boy
had
changed
his
fears
to
hopes
athos
was
happy
happy
as
he
had
never
been
before
and
you
assisted
and
took
part
in
this
great
battle
bragelonne
cried
the
former
musketeer
yes
and
it
was
a
fierce
one
his
highness
the
prince
charged
eleven
times
in
he
is
a
great
commander
he
is
a
hero
sir
i
did
not
lose
sight
of
him
for
an
instant
oh
how
fine
it
is
to
be
called
conde
and
to
be
so
worthy
of
such
a
name
he
was
calm
and
radiant
was
he
not
as
calm
as
at
parade
radiant
as
at
a
fete
when
we
went
up
to
the
enemy
it
was
slowly
we
were
forbidden
to
draw
first
and
we
were
marching
toward
the
spaniards
who
were
on
a
height
with
lowered
muskets
when
we
arrived
about
thirty
paces
from
them
the
prince
turned
around
to
the
soldiers
comrades
he
said
you
are
about
to
suffer
a
furious
discharge
but
after
that
you
will
make
short
work
with
those
there
was
such
dead
silence
that
friends
and
enemies
could
have
heard
these
words
then
raising
his
sword
sound
trumpets
he
well
very
good
you
will
do
as
much
when
the
opportunity
occurs
will
you
raoul
i
know
not
sir
but
i
thought
it
really
very
fine
and
grand
were
you
afraid
raoul
asked
the
count
yes
sir
replied
the
young
man
naively
i
felt
a
great
chill
at
my
heart
and
at
the
word
fire
which
resounded
in
spanish
from
the
enemy
s
ranks
i
closed
my
eyes
and
thought
of
in
honest
truth
raoul
said
athos
pressing
his
hand
yes
sir
at
that
instant
there
was
such
a
rataplan
of
musketry
that
one
might
have
imagined
the
infernal
regions
had
opened
those
who
were
not
killed
felt
the
heat
of
the
flames
i
opened
my
eyes
astonished
to
find
myself
alive
and
even
unhurt
a
third
of
the
squadron
were
lying
on
the
ground
wounded
dead
or
dying
at
that
moment
i
encountered
the
eye
of
the
prince
i
had
but
one
thought
and
that
was
that
he
was
observing
me
i
spurred
on
and
found
myself
in
the
enemy
s
and
the
prince
was
pleased
with
you
he
told
me
so
at
least
sir
when
he
desired
me
to
return
to
paris
with
monsieur
de
chatillon
who
was
charged
to
carry
the
news
to
the
queen
and
to
bring
the
colors
we
had
taken
go
said
he
the
enemy
will
not
rally
for
fifteen
days
and
until
that
time
i
have
no
need
of
your
service
go
and
see
those
whom
you
love
and
who
love
you
and
tell
my
sister
de
longueville
that
i
thank
her
for
the
present
that
she
made
me
of
and
i
came
sir
added
raoul
gazing
at
the
count
with
a
smile
of
real
affection
for
i
thought
you
would
be
glad
to
see
me
athos
drew
the
young
man
toward
him
and
pressed
his
lips
to
his
brow
as
he
would
have
done
to
a
young
daughter
and
now
raoul
said
he
you
are
launched
you
have
dukes
for
friends
a
marshal
of
france
for
godfather
a
prince
of
the
blood
as
commander
and
on
the
day
of
your
return
you
have
been
received
by
two
queens
it
is
not
so
bad
for
a
oh
sir
said
raoul
suddenly
you
recall
something
which
in
my
haste
to
relate
my
exploits
i
had
forgotten
it
is
that
there
was
with
her
majesty
the
queen
of
england
a
gentleman
who
when
i
pronounced
your
name
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
joy
he
said
he
was
a
friend
of
yours
asked
your
address
and
is
coming
to
see
what
is
his
name
i
did
not
venture
to
ask
sir
he
spoke
elegantly
although
i
thought
from
his
accent
he
was
an
ah
said
athos
leaning
down
his
head
as
if
to
remember
who
it
could
be
then
when
he
raised
it
again
he
was
struck
by
the
presence
of
a
man
who
was
standing
at
the
open
door
and
was
gazing
at
him
with
a
compassionate
air
lord
de
winter
exclaimed
the
count
athos
my
friend
and
the
two
gentlemen
were
for
an
instant
locked
in
each
other
s
arms
then
athos
looking
into
his
friend
s
face
and
taking
him
by
both
hands
said
what
ails
you
my
lord
you
appear
as
unhappy
as
i
am
the
yes
truly
dear
friend
and
i
may
even
say
the
sight
of
you
increases
my
and
de
winter
glancing
around
him
raoul
quickly
understood
that
the
two
friends
wished
to
be
alone
and
he
therefore
left
the
room
unaffectedly
come
now
that
we
are
alone
said
athos
let
us
talk
of
whilst
we
are
alone
let
us
speak
of
ourselves
replied
de
winter
he
is
who
milady
s
athos
again
struck
by
this
name
which
seemed
to
pursue
him
like
an
echo
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
slightly
knitting
his
brows
he
calmly
said
i
know
it
grimaud
met
him
between
bethune
and
arras
and
then
came
here
to
warn
me
of
his
does
grimaud
know
him
then
no
but
he
was
present
at
the
deathbed
of
a
man
who
knew
the
headsman
of
bethune
exclaimed
de
winter
you
know
about
that
cried
athos
astonished
he
has
just
left
me
replied
de
winter
after
telling
me
all
ah
my
friend
what
a
horrible
scene
why
did
we
not
destroy
the
child
with
the
mother
what
need
you
fear
said
athos
recovering
from
the
instinctive
fear
he
had
at
first
experienced
by
the
aid
of
reason
are
we
not
men
accustomed
to
defend
ourselves
is
this
young
man
an
assassin
by
profession
a
murderer
in
cold
blood
he
has
killed
the
executioner
of
bethune
in
an
access
of
passion
but
now
his
fury
is
de
winter
smiled
sorrowfully
and
shook
his
head
do
you
not
know
the
race
said
he
pooh
said
athos
trying
to
smile
in
his
turn
it
must
have
lost
its
ferocity
in
the
second
generation
besides
my
friend
providence
has
warned
us
that
we
may
be
on
our
guard
all
we
can
now
do
is
to
wait
let
us
wait
and
as
i
said
before
let
us
speak
of
yourself
what
brings
you
to
paris
affairs
of
importance
which
you
shall
know
later
but
what
is
this
that
i
hear
from
her
majesty
the
queen
of
england
monsieur
d
artagnan
sides
with
mazarin
pardon
my
frankness
dear
friend
i
neither
hate
nor
blame
the
cardinal
and
your
opinions
will
be
held
ever
sacred
by
me
but
do
you
happen
to
belong
to
him
monsieur
d
artagnan
replied
athos
is
in
the
service
he
is
a
soldier
and
obeys
all
constitutional
authority
monsieur
d
artagnan
is
not
rich
and
has
need
of
his
position
as
lieutenant
to
enable
him
to
live
millionaires
like
yourself
my
lord
are
rare
in
alas
said
de
winter
i
am
at
this
moment
as
poor
as
he
is
if
not
poorer
but
to
return
to
our
well
then
you
wish
to
know
if
i
am
of
mazarin
s
party
no
pardon
my
frankness
too
my
i
am
obliged
to
you
count
for
this
pleasing
intelligence
you
make
me
young
and
happy
again
by
it
ah
so
you
are
not
a
mazarinist
delightful
indeed
you
could
not
belong
to
him
but
pardon
me
are
you
free
i
mean
to
ask
if
you
are
married
ah
as
to
that
no
replied
athos
laughing
because
that
young
man
so
handsome
so
elegant
so
polished
is
a
child
i
have
adopted
and
who
does
not
even
know
who
was
his
very
well
you
are
always
the
same
athos
great
and
generous
are
you
still
friends
with
monsieur
porthos
and
monsieur
aramis
add
monsieur
d
artagnan
my
lord
we
still
remain
four
friends
devoted
to
each
other
but
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
serving
the
cardinal
or
of
fighting
him
of
being
mazarinists
or
frondists
then
we
are
only
is
monsieur
aramis
with
d
artagnan
asked
lord
de
winter
no
said
athos
monsieur
aramis
does
me
the
honor
to
share
my
could
you
put
me
in
communication
with
your
witty
and
agreeable
friend
is
he
much
changed
he
has
become
an
abbe
that
is
you
alarm
me
his
profession
must
have
made
him
renounce
any
great
on
the
contrary
said
athos
smiling
he
has
never
been
so
much
a
musketeer
as
since
he
became
an
abbe
and
you
will
find
him
a
veritable
could
you
engage
to
bring
him
to
me
morning
at
ten
o
clock
on
the
pont
du
louvre
oh
oh
exclaimed
athos
smiling
you
have
a
duel
in
yes
count
and
a
splendid
duel
too
a
duel
in
which
i
hope
you
will
take
your
where
are
we
to
go
my
lord
to
her
majesty
the
queen
of
england
who
has
desired
me
to
present
you
to
this
is
an
enigma
said
athos
but
it
matters
not
since
you
know
the
solution
of
it
i
ask
no
further
will
your
lordship
do
me
the
honor
to
sup
with
me
thanks
count
no
replied
de
winter
i
own
to
you
that
that
young
man
s
visit
has
subdued
my
appetite
and
probably
will
rob
me
of
my
sleep
what
undertaking
can
have
brought
him
to
paris
it
was
not
to
meet
me
that
he
came
for
he
was
ignorant
of
my
journey
this
young
man
terrifies
me
my
lord
there
lies
in
him
a
sanguinary
what
occupies
him
in
england
he
is
one
of
cromwell
s
most
enthusiastic
but
what
attached
him
to
the
cause
his
father
and
mother
were
catholics
i
believe
his
hatred
of
the
king
who
deprived
him
of
his
estates
and
forbade
him
to
bear
the
name
of
de
and
what
name
does
he
now
bear
a
puritan
yet
disguised
as
a
monk
he
travels
alone
in
do
you
say
as
a
monk
it
was
thus
and
by
mere
accident
may
god
pardon
me
if
i
blaspheme
that
he
heard
the
confession
of
the
executioner
of
then
i
understand
it
all
he
has
been
sent
by
cromwell
to
mazarin
and
the
queen
guessed
rightly
we
have
been
forestalled
everything
is
clear
to
me
now
adieu
count
till
but
the
night
is
dark
said
athos
perceiving
that
lord
de
winter
seemed
more
uneasy
than
he
wished
to
appear
and
you
have
no
i
have
tony
a
safe
if
simple
halloo
there
grimaud
olivain
and
blaisois
call
the
viscount
and
take
the
musket
with
blaisois
was
the
tall
youth
half
groom
half
peasant
whom
we
saw
at
the
chateau
de
bragelonne
whom
athos
had
christened
by
the
name
of
his
province
viscount
said
athos
to
raoul
as
he
entered
you
will
conduct
my
lord
as
far
as
his
hotel
and
permit
no
one
to
approach
oh
count
said
de
winter
for
whom
do
you
take
me
for
a
stranger
who
does
not
know
paris
said
athos
and
to
whom
the
viscount
will
show
the
de
winter
shook
him
by
the
hand
grimaud
said
athos
put
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
troop
and
beware
of
the
grimaud
shuddered
and
nodding
awaited
the
departure
regarding
the
butt
of
his
musket
with
silent
eloquence
then
obeying
the
orders
given
him
by
athos
he
headed
the
small
procession
bearing
the
torch
in
one
hand
and
the
musket
in
the
other
until
it
reached
de
winter
s
inn
when
pounding
on
the
portal
with
his
fist
he
bowed
to
my
lord
and
faced
about
without
a
word
the
same
order
was
followed
in
returning
nor
did
grimaud
s
searching
glance
discover
anything
of
a
suspicious
appearance
save
a
dark
shadow
as
it
were
in
ambuscade
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
guenegaud
and
of
the
quai
he
fancied
also
that
in
going
he
had
already
observed
the
street
watcher
who
had
attracted
his
attention
he
pushed
on
toward
him
but
before
he
could
reach
it
the
shadow
had
disappeared
into
an
alley
into
which
grimaud
deemed
it
scarcely
prudent
to
pursue
it
the
next
day
on
awaking
the
count
perceived
raoul
by
his
bedside
the
young
man
was
already
dressed
and
was
reading
a
new
book
by
chapelain
already
up
raoul
exclaimed
the
count
yes
sir
replied
raoul
with
slight
hesitation
i
did
not
sleep
you
raoul
not
sleep
well
then
you
must
have
something
on
your
mind
said
athos
sir
you
will
perhaps
think
that
i
am
in
a
great
hurry
to
leave
you
when
i
have
only
just
arrived
but
have
you
only
two
days
of
leave
raoul
on
the
contrary
sir
i
have
ten
nor
is
it
to
the
camp
i
wish
to
where
then
said
athos
smiling
if
it
be
not
a
secret
you
are
now
almost
a
man
since
you
have
made
your
first
passage
of
arms
and
have
acquired
the
right
to
go
where
you
will
without
consulting
never
sir
said
raoul
as
long
as
i
possess
the
happiness
of
having
you
for
a
protector
shall
i
deem
i
have
the
right
of
freeing
myself
from
a
guardianship
so
valuable
to
me
i
have
however
a
wish
to
go
and
pass
a
day
at
blois
you
look
at
me
and
you
are
going
to
laugh
at
no
on
the
contrary
i
am
not
inclined
to
laugh
said
athos
suppressing
a
sigh
you
wish
to
see
blois
again
it
is
but
then
you
permit
me
to
go
you
are
not
angry
in
your
heart
exclaimed
raoul
joyously
certainly
and
why
should
i
regret
what
gives
you
pleasure
oh
how
kind
you
are
exclaimed
the
young
man
pressing
his
guardian
s
hand
and
i
can
set
out
immediately
when
you
like
sir
said
raoul
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
i
have
thought
of
one
thing
and
that
is
about
the
duchess
of
chevreuse
who
was
so
kind
to
me
and
to
whom
i
owe
my
introduction
to
the
and
you
ought
to
thank
her
raoul
well
try
the
hotel
de
luynes
raoul
and
ask
if
the
duchess
can
receive
you
i
am
glad
to
see
you
pay
attention
to
the
usages
of
the
world
you
must
take
grimaud
and
both
sir
asked
raoul
astonished
raoul
went
out
and
when
athos
heard
his
young
joyous
voice
calling
to
grimaud
and
olivain
he
sighed
it
is
very
soon
to
leave
me
he
thought
but
he
follows
the
common
custom
nature
has
made
us
thus
she
makes
the
young
look
ever
forward
not
behind
he
certainly
likes
the
child
but
will
he
love
me
less
as
his
affection
grows
for
her
and
athos
confessed
to
himself
that
he
was
unprepared
for
so
prompt
a
departure
but
raoul
was
so
happy
that
this
reflection
effaced
everything
else
from
the
consideration
of
his
guardian
everything
was
ready
at
ten
o
clock
for
the
departure
and
as
athos
was
watching
raoul
mount
a
groom
rode
up
from
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
he
was
charged
to
tell
the
comte
de
la
fere
that
she
had
learned
of
the
return
of
her
youthful
protege
and
also
the
manner
he
had
conducted
himself
on
the
field
and
she
added
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
offer
him
her
congratulations
tell
her
grace
replied
athos
that
the
viscount
has
just
mounted
his
horse
to
proceed
to
the
hotel
de
then
with
renewed
instructions
to
grimaud
athos
signified
to
raoul
that
he
could
set
out
and
ended
by
reflecting
that
it
was
perhaps
better
that
raoul
should
be
away
from
paris
at
that
moment
another
queen
in
want
of
help
athos
had
not
failed
to
send
early
to
aramis
and
had
given
his
letter
to
blaisois
the
only
whom
he
had
left
blaisois
found
bazin
donning
his
beadle
s
gown
his
services
being
required
that
day
at
notre
dame
athos
had
desired
blaisois
to
try
to
speak
to
aramis
himself
blaisois
a
tall
simple
youth
who
understood
nothing
but
what
he
was
expressly
told
asked
therefore
for
the
abbe
d
herblay
and
in
spite
of
bazin
s
assurances
that
his
master
was
not
at
home
he
persisted
in
such
a
manner
as
to
put
bazin
into
a
passion
blaisois
seeing
bazin
in
clerical
guise
was
a
little
discomposed
at
his
denials
and
wanted
to
pass
at
all
risks
believing
too
that
the
man
with
whom
he
had
to
do
was
endowed
with
the
virtues
of
his
cloth
namely
patience
and
christian
charity
but
bazin
still
the
servant
of
a
musketeer
when
once
the
blood
mounted
to
his
fat
cheeks
seized
a
broomstick
and
began
belaboring
blaisois
saying
you
have
insulted
the
church
my
friend
you
have
insulted
the
church
at
this
moment
aramis
aroused
by
this
unusual
disturbance
cautiously
opened
the
door
of
his
room
and
blaisois
looking
reproachfully
at
the
cerberus
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
presented
it
to
aramis
from
the
comte
de
la
fere
said
aramis
all
and
he
retired
into
his
room
without
even
asking
the
cause
of
so
much
noise
blaisois
returned
disconsolate
to
the
hotel
of
the
grand
roi
charlemagne
and
when
athos
inquired
if
his
commission
was
executed
he
related
his
adventure
you
foolish
fellow
said
athos
laughing
and
you
did
not
tell
him
that
you
came
from
me
no
at
ten
o
clock
athos
with
his
habitual
exactitude
was
waiting
on
the
pont
du
louvre
and
was
almost
immediately
joined
by
lord
de
winter
they
waited
ten
minutes
and
then
his
lordship
began
to
fear
aramis
was
not
coming
to
join
them
patience
said
athos
whose
eyes
were
fixed
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
du
bac
patience
i
see
an
abbe
cuffing
a
man
then
bowing
to
a
woman
it
must
be
it
was
indeed
aramis
having
run
against
a
young
shopkeeper
who
was
gaping
at
the
crows
and
who
had
splashed
him
aramis
with
one
blow
of
his
fist
had
distanced
him
ten
paces
at
this
moment
one
of
his
penitents
passed
and
as
she
was
young
and
pretty
aramis
took
off
his
cap
to
her
with
his
most
gracious
smile
a
most
affectionate
greeting
as
one
can
well
believe
took
place
between
him
and
lord
de
winter
where
are
we
going
inquired
aramis
are
we
going
to
fight
perchance
i
carry
no
sword
this
morning
and
can
not
return
home
to
procure
no
said
lord
de
winter
we
are
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
majesty
the
queen
of
oh
very
well
replied
aramis
then
bending
his
face
down
to
athos
s
ear
what
is
the
object
of
this
visit
continued
he
nay
i
know
not
some
evidence
required
from
us
may
it
not
be
about
that
cursed
affair
asked
aramis
in
which
case
i
do
not
greatly
care
to
go
for
it
will
be
to
pocket
a
lecture
and
since
it
is
my
function
to
give
them
to
others
i
am
rather
averse
to
receiving
them
if
it
were
so
answered
athos
we
should
not
be
taken
there
by
lord
de
winter
for
he
would
come
in
for
his
share
he
was
one
of
you
re
right
yes
let
us
on
arriving
at
the
louvre
lord
de
winter
entered
first
indeed
there
was
but
one
porter
there
to
receive
them
at
the
gate
it
was
impossible
in
daylight
for
the
impoverished
state
of
the
habitation
grudging
charity
had
conceded
to
an
unfortunate
queen
to
pass
unnoticed
by
athos
aramis
and
even
the
englishman
large
rooms
completely
stripped
of
furniture
bare
walls
upon
which
here
and
there
shone
the
old
gold
moldings
which
had
resisted
time
and
neglect
windows
with
broken
panes
impossible
to
close
no
carpets
neither
guards
nor
servants
this
is
what
first
met
the
eyes
of
athos
to
which
he
touching
his
companion
s
elbow
directed
his
attention
by
his
glances
mazarin
is
better
lodged
said
aramis
mazarin
is
almost
king
answered
athos
madame
henrietta
is
almost
no
longer
if
you
would
condescend
to
be
clever
athos
observed
aramis
i
really
do
think
you
would
be
wittier
than
poor
monsieur
de
athos
smiled
the
queen
appeared
to
be
impatiently
expecting
them
for
at
the
first
slight
noise
she
heard
in
the
hall
leading
to
her
room
she
came
herself
to
the
door
to
receive
these
courtiers
in
the
corridors
of
misfortune
enter
you
are
welcome
gentlemen
she
said
the
gentlemen
entered
and
remained
standing
but
at
a
motion
from
the
queen
they
seated
themselves
athos
was
calm
and
grave
but
aramis
was
furious
the
sight
of
such
royal
misery
exasperated
him
and
his
eyes
examined
every
new
trace
of
poverty
that
presented
itself
you
are
examining
the
luxury
i
enjoy
said
the
queen
glancing
sadly
around
her
madame
replied
aramis
i
must
ask
your
pardon
but
i
know
not
how
to
hide
my
indignation
at
seeing
how
a
daughter
of
henry
iv
is
treated
at
the
court
of
monsieur
aramis
is
not
an
officer
asked
the
queen
of
lord
de
winter
that
gentleman
is
the
abbe
d
herblay
replied
he
aramis
blushed
madame
he
said
i
am
an
abbe
it
is
true
but
i
am
so
against
my
will
i
never
had
a
vocation
for
the
bands
my
cassock
is
fastened
by
one
button
only
and
i
am
always
ready
to
become
a
musketeer
once
more
this
morning
being
ignorant
that
i
should
have
the
honor
of
seeing
your
majesty
i
encumbered
myself
with
this
dress
but
you
will
find
me
none
the
less
a
man
devoted
to
your
majesty
s
service
in
whatever
way
you
may
see
fit
to
use
the
abbe
d
herblay
resumed
de
winter
is
one
of
those
gallant
musketeers
formerly
belonging
to
his
majesty
king
louis
of
whom
i
have
spoken
to
you
then
turning
to
athos
he
continued
and
this
gentleman
is
that
noble
comte
de
la
fere
whose
high
reputation
is
so
well
known
to
your
gentlemen
said
the
queen
a
few
years
ago
i
had
around
me
ushers
treasures
armies
and
by
the
lifting
of
a
finger
all
these
were
busied
in
my
service
look
around
you
and
it
may
astonish
you
that
in
order
to
accomplish
a
plan
which
is
dearer
to
me
than
life
i
have
only
lord
de
winter
the
friend
of
twenty
years
and
you
gentlemen
whom
i
see
for
the
first
time
and
whom
i
know
but
as
my
it
is
enough
said
athos
bowing
low
if
the
lives
of
three
men
can
purchase
yours
i
thank
you
gentlemen
but
hear
me
continued
she
i
am
not
only
the
most
miserable
of
queens
but
the
most
unhappy
of
mothers
the
most
wretched
of
wives
my
children
two
of
them
at
least
the
duke
of
york
and
the
princess
elizabeth
are
far
away
from
me
exposed
to
the
blows
of
the
ambitious
and
our
foes
my
husband
the
king
is
leading
in
england
so
wretched
an
existence
that
it
is
no
exaggeration
to
aver
that
he
seeks
death
as
a
thing
to
be
desired
hold
gentlemen
here
is
the
letter
conveyed
to
me
by
lord
de
winter
read
obeying
the
queen
athos
read
aloud
the
letter
which
we
have
already
seen
in
which
king
charles
demanded
to
know
whether
the
hospitality
of
france
would
be
accorded
him
well
asked
athos
when
he
had
closed
the
letter
well
said
the
queen
it
has
been
the
two
friends
exchanged
a
smile
of
contempt
and
now
said
athos
what
is
to
be
done
i
have
the
honor
to
inquire
from
your
majesty
what
you
desire
monsieur
d
herblay
and
myself
to
do
in
your
service
we
are
ah
sir
you
have
a
noble
heart
exclaimed
the
queen
with
a
burst
of
gratitude
whilst
lord
de
winter
turned
to
her
with
a
glance
which
said
did
i
not
answer
for
them
but
you
sir
said
the
queen
to
aramis
i
madame
replied
he
follow
monsieur
de
la
fere
wherever
he
leads
even
were
it
on
to
death
without
demanding
wherefore
but
when
it
concerns
your
majesty
s
service
then
added
he
looking
at
the
queen
with
all
the
grace
of
former
days
i
precede
the
well
then
gentlemen
said
the
queen
since
it
is
thus
and
since
you
are
willing
to
devote
yourselves
to
the
service
of
a
poor
princess
whom
the
whole
world
has
abandoned
this
is
what
is
required
to
be
done
for
me
the
king
is
alone
with
a
few
gentlemen
whom
he
fears
to
lose
every
day
surrounded
by
the
scotch
whom
he
distrusts
although
he
be
himself
a
scotchman
since
lord
de
winter
left
him
i
am
distracted
sirs
i
ask
much
too
much
perhaps
for
i
have
no
title
to
request
it
go
to
england
join
the
king
be
his
friends
protectors
march
to
battle
at
his
side
and
be
near
him
in
his
house
where
conspiracies
more
dangerous
than
the
perils
of
war
are
hatching
every
day
and
in
exchange
for
the
sacrifice
that
you
make
gentlemen
i
promise
not
to
reward
you
i
believe
that
word
would
offend
you
but
to
love
you
as
a
sister
to
prefer
you
next
to
my
husband
and
my
children
to
every
one
i
swear
it
before
and
the
queen
raised
her
eyes
solemnly
upward
madame
said
athos
when
must
we
set
out
you
consent
then
exclaimed
the
queen
joyfully
yes
madame
only
it
seems
to
me
that
your
majesty
goes
too
far
in
engaging
to
load
us
with
a
friendship
so
far
above
our
merit
we
render
service
to
god
madame
in
serving
a
prince
so
unfortunate
a
queen
so
virtuous
madame
we
are
yours
body
and
oh
sirs
said
the
queen
moved
even
to
tears
this
is
the
first
time
for
five
years
i
have
felt
the
least
approach
to
joy
or
hope
god
who
can
read
my
heart
all
the
gratitude
i
feel
will
reward
you
save
my
husband
save
the
king
and
although
you
care
not
for
the
price
that
is
placed
upon
a
good
action
in
this
world
leave
me
the
hope
that
we
shall
meet
again
when
i
may
be
able
to
thank
you
myself
in
the
meantime
i
remain
here
have
you
anything
to
ask
of
me
from
this
moment
i
become
your
friend
and
since
you
are
engaged
in
my
affairs
i
ought
to
occupy
myself
in
madame
replied
athos
i
have
only
to
ask
your
majesty
s
and
i
said
aramis
i
am
alone
in
the
world
and
have
only
your
majesty
to
the
queen
held
out
her
hand
which
they
kissed
and
she
said
in
a
low
tone
to
de
winter
if
you
need
money
my
lord
separate
the
jewels
i
have
given
you
detach
the
diamonds
and
sell
them
to
some
jew
you
will
receive
for
them
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
francs
spend
them
if
necessary
but
let
these
gentlemen
be
treated
as
they
deserve
that
is
to
say
like
the
queen
had
two
letters
ready
one
written
by
herself
the
other
by
her
daughter
the
princess
henrietta
both
were
addressed
to
king
charles
she
gave
the
first
to
athos
and
the
other
to
aramis
so
that
should
they
be
separated
by
chance
they
might
make
themselves
known
to
the
king
after
which
they
withdrew
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
de
winter
stopped
not
to
arouse
suspicions
gentlemen
said
he
go
your
way
and
i
will
go
mine
and
this
evening
at
nine
o
clock
we
will
assemble
again
at
the
gate
saint
denis
we
will
travel
on
horseback
as
far
as
our
horses
can
go
and
afterward
we
can
take
the
post
once
more
let
me
thank
you
my
good
friends
both
in
my
own
name
and
the
queen
the
three
gentlemen
then
shook
hands
lord
de
winter
taking
the
rue
saint
honore
and
athos
and
aramis
remaining
together
well
said
aramis
when
they
were
alone
what
do
you
think
of
this
business
my
dear
count
bad
replied
athos
very
but
you
received
it
with
as
i
shall
ever
receive
the
defense
of
a
great
principle
my
dear
d
herblay
monarchs
are
only
strong
by
the
assistance
of
the
aristocracy
but
aristocracy
can
not
survive
without
the
countenance
of
monarchs
let
us
then
support
monarchy
in
order
to
support
ourselves
we
shall
be
murdered
there
said
aramis
i
hate
the
english
they
are
coarse
like
every
nation
that
swills
would
it
be
better
to
remain
here
said
athos
and
take
a
turn
in
the
bastile
or
the
dungeon
of
vincennes
for
having
favored
the
escape
of
monsieur
de
beaufort
i
faith
aramis
believe
me
there
is
little
left
to
regret
we
avoid
imprisonment
and
we
play
the
part
of
heroes
the
choice
is
it
is
true
but
in
everything
friend
one
must
always
return
to
the
same
question
a
stupid
one
i
admit
but
very
necessary
have
you
any
money
something
like
a
hundred
pistoles
that
my
farmer
sent
to
me
the
day
before
i
left
bragelonne
but
out
of
that
sum
i
ought
to
leave
fifty
for
raoul
a
young
man
must
live
respectably
i
have
then
about
fifty
pistoles
and
you
as
for
me
i
am
quite
sure
that
after
turning
out
all
my
pockets
and
emptying
my
drawers
i
shall
not
find
ten
louis
at
home
fortunately
lord
de
winter
is
lord
de
winter
is
ruined
for
the
moment
oliver
cromwell
has
annexed
his
income
now
is
the
time
when
baron
porthos
would
be
now
it
is
that
i
regret
d
let
us
entice
them
this
secret
aramis
does
not
belong
to
us
take
my
advice
then
and
let
no
one
into
our
confidence
and
moreover
in
taking
such
a
step
we
should
appear
to
be
doubtful
of
ourselves
let
us
regret
their
absence
to
ourselves
for
our
own
sakes
but
not
speak
of
you
are
right
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
until
this
evening
i
have
two
things
to
and
what
are
they
first
a
thrust
with
the
coadjutor
whom
i
met
last
night
at
madame
de
rambouillet
s
and
whom
i
found
particular
in
his
remarks
respecting
oh
fie
a
quarrel
between
priests
a
duel
between
allies
what
can
i
do
friend
he
is
a
bully
and
so
am
i
his
cassock
is
a
burden
to
him
and
i
imagine
i
have
had
enough
of
mine
in
fact
there
is
so
much
resemblance
between
us
that
i
sometimes
believe
he
is
aramis
and
i
am
the
coadjutor
this
kind
of
life
fatigues
and
oppresses
me
besides
he
is
a
turbulent
fellow
who
will
ruin
our
party
i
am
convinced
that
if
i
gave
him
a
box
on
the
ear
such
as
i
gave
this
morning
to
the
little
citizen
who
splashed
me
it
would
change
the
appearance
of
and
i
my
dear
aramis
quietly
replied
athos
i
think
it
would
only
change
monsieur
de
retz
s
appearance
take
my
advice
leave
things
just
as
they
are
besides
you
are
neither
of
you
now
your
own
masters
he
belongs
to
the
fronde
and
you
to
the
queen
of
england
so
if
the
second
matter
which
you
regret
being
unable
to
attend
to
is
not
more
important
than
the
first
oh
that
is
of
the
first
attend
to
it
then
at
unfortunately
it
is
a
thing
that
i
can
t
perform
at
any
time
i
choose
it
was
arranged
for
the
evening
and
no
other
time
will
i
understand
said
athos
smiling
about
that
but
my
dear
fellow
those
are
things
that
bear
postponement
and
you
must
put
it
off
especially
with
so
good
an
excuse
to
give
on
your
return
yes
if
i
if
you
do
not
return
how
does
it
concern
you
be
reasonable
come
you
are
no
longer
twenty
years
to
my
great
regret
mordieu
ah
if
i
were
but
twenty
years
old
yes
said
athos
doubtless
you
would
commit
great
follies
but
now
we
must
part
i
have
one
or
two
visits
to
make
and
a
letter
yet
to
write
call
for
me
at
eight
o
clock
or
shall
i
wait
supper
for
you
at
seven
that
will
do
very
well
said
aramis
i
have
twenty
visits
to
make
and
as
many
letters
to
they
then
separated
athos
went
to
pay
a
visit
to
madame
de
vendome
left
his
name
at
madame
de
chevreuse
s
and
wrote
the
following
letter
to
d
artagnan
dear
friend
i
am
about
to
set
off
with
aramis
on
important
business
i
wished
to
make
my
adieux
to
you
but
time
does
not
permit
remember
that
i
write
to
you
now
to
repeat
how
much
affection
for
you
i
still
cherish
raoul
is
gone
to
blois
and
is
ignorant
of
my
departure
watch
over
him
in
my
absence
as
much
as
you
possibly
can
and
if
by
chance
you
receive
no
news
of
me
three
months
hence
tell
him
to
open
a
packet
which
he
will
find
addressed
to
him
in
my
bronze
casket
at
blois
of
which
i
send
you
now
the
key
embrace
porthos
from
aramis
and
myself
adieu
perhaps
at
the
hour
agreed
upon
aramis
arrived
he
was
dressed
as
an
officer
and
had
the
old
sword
at
his
side
which
he
had
drawn
so
often
and
which
he
was
more
than
ever
ready
to
draw
he
said
i
think
that
we
are
decidedly
wrong
to
depart
thus
without
leaving
a
line
for
porthos
and
d
the
thing
is
done
dear
friend
said
athos
i
foresaw
that
and
have
embraced
them
both
from
you
and
you
are
a
wonderful
man
my
dear
count
said
aramis
you
think
of
well
have
you
made
up
your
mind
to
this
journey
quite
and
now
that
i
reflect
about
it
i
am
glad
to
leave
paris
at
this
and
so
am
i
replied
athos
my
only
regret
is
not
having
seen
d
artagnan
but
the
rascal
is
so
cunning
he
might
have
guessed
our
when
supper
was
over
blaisois
entered
sir
said
he
here
is
monsieur
d
artagnan
s
but
i
did
not
tell
you
there
would
be
an
answer
stupid
said
athos
and
i
set
off
without
waiting
for
one
but
he
called
me
back
and
gave
me
this
and
he
presented
a
little
leather
bag
plump
and
giving
out
a
golden
jingle
athos
opened
it
and
began
by
drawing
forth
a
little
note
written
in
these
terms
my
dear
count
when
one
travels
and
especially
for
three
months
one
never
has
a
superfluity
of
money
now
recalling
former
times
of
mutual
distress
i
send
you
half
my
purse
it
is
money
to
obtain
which
i
made
mazarin
sweat
don
t
make
a
bad
use
of
it
i
entreat
you
as
to
what
you
say
about
not
seeing
you
again
i
believe
not
a
word
of
it
with
such
a
heart
as
yours
and
such
a
sword
one
passes
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
a
dozen
times
unscathed
and
unalarmed
au
revoir
not
farewell
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
from
the
day
i
saw
raoul
i
loved
him
nevertheless
believe
that
i
heartily
pray
that
i
may
not
become
to
him
a
father
however
much
i
might
be
proud
of
such
a
son
your
d
artagnan
be
it
well
understood
that
the
fifty
louis
which
i
send
are
equally
for
aramis
as
for
you
for
you
as
athos
smiled
and
his
fine
eye
was
dimmed
by
a
tear
d
artagnan
who
had
loved
him
so
tenderly
loved
him
still
although
a
mazarinist
there
are
the
fifty
louis
i
faith
said
aramis
emptying
the
purse
on
the
table
all
bearing
the
effigy
of
louis
xiii
well
what
shall
you
do
with
this
money
count
shall
you
keep
it
or
send
it
back
i
shall
keep
it
aramis
and
even
though
i
had
no
need
of
it
i
still
should
keep
it
what
is
offered
from
a
generous
heart
should
be
accepted
generously
take
of
them
aramis
and
give
me
the
remaining
all
right
i
am
glad
to
see
you
are
of
my
opinion
there
now
shall
we
start
when
you
like
but
have
you
no
groom
no
that
idiot
bazin
had
the
folly
to
make
himself
verger
as
you
know
and
therefore
can
not
leave
notre
dame
very
well
take
blaisois
with
whom
i
know
not
what
to
do
since
i
already
have
willingly
said
aramis
at
this
moment
grimaud
appeared
at
the
door
ready
said
he
with
his
usual
curtness
let
us
go
then
said
athos
the
two
friends
mounted
as
did
their
servants
at
the
corner
of
the
quai
they
encountered
bazin
who
was
running
breathlessly
oh
sir
exclaimed
he
thank
heaven
i
have
arrived
in
time
monsieur
porthos
has
just
been
to
your
house
and
has
left
this
for
you
saying
that
the
letter
was
important
and
must
be
given
to
you
before
you
good
said
aramis
taking
a
purse
which
bazin
presented
to
him
what
is
this
wait
your
reverence
there
is
a
you
know
i
have
already
told
you
that
if
you
ever
call
me
anything
but
chevalier
i
will
break
every
bone
in
your
body
give
me
the
how
can
you
read
asked
athos
it
is
as
dark
as
a
cold
wait
said
bazin
striking
a
flint
and
setting
afire
a
twisted
with
which
he
started
the
church
candles
thus
illumined
aramis
read
the
following
epistle
my
dear
d
herblay
i
learned
from
d
artagnan
who
has
embraced
me
on
the
part
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
yourself
that
you
are
setting
out
on
a
journey
which
may
perhaps
last
two
or
three
months
as
i
know
that
you
do
not
like
to
ask
money
of
your
friends
i
offer
you
some
of
my
own
accord
here
are
two
hundred
pistoles
which
you
can
dispose
of
as
you
wish
and
return
to
me
when
opportunity
occurs
do
not
fear
that
you
put
me
to
inconvenience
if
i
want
money
i
can
send
for
some
to
any
of
my
chateaux
at
bracieux
alone
i
have
twenty
thousand
francs
in
gold
so
if
i
do
not
send
you
more
it
is
because
i
fear
you
would
not
accept
a
larger
sum
i
address
you
because
you
know
that
although
i
esteem
him
from
my
heart
i
am
a
little
awed
by
the
comte
de
la
fere
but
it
is
understood
that
what
i
offer
you
i
offer
him
at
the
same
time
i
am
as
i
trust
you
do
not
doubt
your
devoted
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
well
said
aramis
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
say
my
dear
d
herblay
that
it
is
almost
sacrilege
to
distrust
providence
when
one
has
such
friends
and
therefore
we
will
divide
the
pistoles
from
porthos
as
we
divided
the
louis
sent
by
d
the
division
being
made
by
the
light
of
bazin
s
taper
the
two
friends
continued
their
road
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
they
had
joined
de
winter
at
the
porte
saint
denis
in
which
it
is
proved
that
first
impulses
are
oftentimes
the
best
the
three
gentlemen
took
the
road
to
picardy
a
road
so
well
known
to
them
and
which
recalled
to
athos
and
aramis
some
of
the
most
picturesque
adventures
of
their
youth
if
mousqueton
were
with
us
observed
athos
on
reaching
the
spot
where
they
had
had
a
dispute
with
the
paviers
how
he
would
tremble
at
passing
this
do
you
remember
aramis
that
it
was
here
he
received
that
famous
bullet
wound
by
my
faith
twould
be
excusable
in
him
to
tremble
replied
aramis
for
even
i
feel
a
shudder
at
the
recollection
hold
just
above
that
tree
is
the
little
spot
where
i
thought
i
was
it
was
soon
time
for
grimaud
to
recall
the
past
arriving
before
the
inn
at
which
his
master
and
himself
had
made
such
an
enormous
repast
he
approached
athos
and
said
showing
him
the
airhole
of
the
cellar
sausages
athos
began
to
laugh
for
this
juvenile
escapade
of
his
appeared
to
be
as
amusing
as
if
some
one
had
related
it
of
another
person
at
last
after
traveling
two
days
and
a
night
they
arrived
at
boulogne
toward
the
evening
favored
by
magnificent
weather
boulogne
was
a
strong
position
then
almost
a
deserted
town
built
entirely
on
the
heights
what
is
now
called
the
lower
town
did
not
then
exist
gentlemen
said
de
winter
on
reaching
the
gate
of
the
town
let
us
do
here
as
at
paris
let
us
separate
to
avoid
suspicion
i
know
an
inn
little
frequented
but
of
which
the
host
is
entirely
devoted
to
me
i
will
go
there
where
i
expect
to
find
letters
and
you
go
to
the
first
tavern
in
the
town
to
l
epee
du
grand
henri
for
instance
refresh
yourselves
and
in
two
hours
be
upon
the
jetty
our
boat
is
waiting
for
us
the
matter
being
thus
decided
the
two
friends
found
about
two
hundred
paces
further
the
tavern
indicated
their
horses
were
fed
but
not
unsaddled
the
grooms
supped
for
it
was
already
late
and
their
two
masters
impatient
to
return
appointed
a
place
of
meeting
with
them
on
the
jetty
and
desired
them
on
no
account
to
exchange
a
word
with
any
one
it
is
needless
to
say
that
this
caution
concerned
blaisois
alone
long
enough
since
it
had
been
a
useless
one
to
grimaud
athos
and
aramis
walked
down
toward
the
port
from
their
dress
covered
with
dust
and
from
a
certain
easy
manner
by
means
of
which
a
man
accustomed
to
travel
is
always
recognizable
the
two
friends
excited
the
attention
of
a
few
promenaders
there
was
more
especially
one
upon
whom
their
arrival
had
produced
a
decided
impression
this
man
whom
they
had
noticed
from
the
first
for
the
same
reason
they
had
themselves
been
remarked
by
others
was
walking
in
a
listless
way
up
and
down
the
jetty
from
the
moment
he
perceived
them
he
did
not
cease
to
look
at
them
and
seemed
to
burn
with
the
wish
to
speak
to
them
on
reaching
the
jetty
athos
and
aramis
stopped
to
look
at
a
little
boat
made
fast
to
a
pile
and
ready
rigged
as
if
waiting
to
start
that
is
doubtless
our
boat
said
athos
yes
replied
aramis
and
the
sloop
out
there
making
ready
to
sail
must
be
that
which
is
to
take
us
to
our
destination
now
continued
he
if
only
de
winter
does
not
keep
us
waiting
it
is
not
at
all
amusing
here
there
is
not
a
single
woman
hush
said
athos
we
are
in
truth
the
walker
who
during
the
observations
of
the
two
friends
had
passed
and
repassed
behind
them
several
times
stopped
at
the
name
of
de
winter
but
as
his
face
betrayed
no
emotion
at
mention
of
this
name
it
might
have
been
by
chance
he
stood
so
still
gentlemen
said
the
man
who
was
young
and
pale
bowing
with
ease
and
courtesy
pardon
my
curiosity
but
i
see
you
come
from
paris
or
at
least
that
you
are
strangers
at
we
come
from
paris
yes
replied
athos
with
the
same
courtesy
what
is
there
we
can
do
for
you
sir
said
the
young
man
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
if
it
be
true
that
cardinal
mazarin
is
no
longer
minister
that
is
a
strange
question
said
aramis
he
is
and
he
is
not
replied
athos
that
is
to
say
he
is
dismissed
by
of
france
but
by
intrigues
and
promises
he
makes
the
other
half
sustain
him
you
will
perceive
that
this
may
last
a
long
however
sir
said
the
stranger
he
has
neither
fled
nor
is
in
prison
no
sir
not
at
this
moment
at
sirs
accept
my
thanks
for
your
politeness
said
the
young
man
retreating
what
do
you
think
of
that
interrogator
asked
aramis
i
think
he
is
either
a
dull
provincial
person
or
a
spy
in
search
of
and
you
replied
to
him
with
that
notion
nothing
warranted
me
to
answer
him
otherwise
he
was
polite
to
me
and
i
was
so
to
but
if
he
be
a
spy
what
do
you
think
a
spy
would
be
about
here
we
are
not
living
in
the
time
of
cardinal
richelieu
who
would
have
closed
the
ports
on
bare
it
matters
not
you
were
wrong
to
reply
to
him
as
you
did
continued
aramis
following
with
his
eyes
the
young
man
now
vanishing
behind
the
cliffs
and
you
said
athos
you
forget
that
you
committed
a
very
different
kind
of
imprudence
in
pronouncing
lord
de
winter
s
name
did
you
not
see
that
at
that
name
the
young
man
stopped
more
reason
then
when
he
spoke
to
you
for
sending
him
about
his
a
quarrel
asked
athos
and
since
when
have
you
become
afraid
of
a
quarrel
i
am
always
afraid
of
a
quarrel
when
i
am
expected
at
any
place
and
when
such
a
quarrel
might
possibly
prevent
my
reaching
it
besides
let
me
own
something
to
you
i
am
anxious
to
see
that
young
man
and
wherefore
aramis
you
will
certainly
laugh
at
me
you
will
say
that
i
am
always
repeating
the
same
thing
you
will
call
me
the
most
timorous
of
visionaries
but
to
whom
do
you
see
a
resemblance
in
that
young
man
in
beauty
or
on
the
contrary
asked
aramis
laughing
in
ugliness
in
so
far
as
a
man
can
resemble
a
ah
egad
cried
aramis
you
set
me
thinking
no
in
truth
you
are
no
visionary
my
dear
friend
and
now
i
think
of
it
you
yes
i
faith
you
re
right
those
delicate
yet
lips
those
eyes
which
seem
always
at
the
command
of
the
intellect
and
never
of
the
heart
yes
it
is
one
of
milady
s
bastards
you
laugh
from
habit
that
is
all
i
swear
to
you
i
like
no
better
than
yourself
to
meet
that
viper
in
my
ah
here
is
de
winter
coming
said
athos
good
one
thing
now
is
only
awanting
and
that
is
that
our
grooms
should
not
keep
us
no
said
athos
i
see
them
about
twenty
paces
behind
my
lord
i
recognize
grimaud
by
his
long
legs
and
his
determined
slouch
tony
carries
our
then
we
set
sail
asked
aramis
glancing
toward
the
west
where
the
sun
had
left
a
single
golden
cloud
which
dipping
into
the
ocean
appeared
by
degrees
to
be
extinguished
probably
said
athos
diable
resumed
aramis
i
have
little
fancy
for
the
sea
by
day
still
less
at
night
the
sounds
of
wind
and
wave
the
frightful
movements
of
the
vessel
i
confess
i
prefer
the
convent
of
athos
smiled
sadly
for
it
was
evident
that
he
was
thinking
of
other
things
as
he
listened
to
his
friend
and
moved
toward
de
winter
what
ails
our
friend
said
aramis
he
resembles
one
of
dante
s
damned
whose
neck
apollyon
has
dislocated
and
who
are
ever
looking
at
their
heels
what
the
devil
makes
him
glower
thus
behind
him
when
de
winter
perceived
them
in
his
turn
he
advanced
toward
them
with
surprising
rapidity
what
is
the
matter
my
lord
said
athos
and
what
puts
you
out
of
breath
thus
nothing
replied
de
winter
nothing
and
yet
in
passing
the
heights
it
seemed
to
me
and
he
again
turned
round
athos
glanced
at
aramis
but
let
us
go
continued
de
winter
let
us
be
off
the
boat
must
be
waiting
for
us
and
there
is
our
sloop
at
anchor
do
you
see
it
there
i
wish
i
were
on
board
already
and
he
looked
back
again
he
has
seen
him
said
athos
in
a
low
tone
to
aramis
they
had
reached
the
ladder
which
led
to
the
boat
de
winter
made
the
grooms
who
carried
the
arms
and
the
porters
with
the
luggage
descend
first
and
was
about
to
follow
them
at
this
moment
athos
perceived
a
man
walking
on
the
seashore
parallel
to
the
jetty
and
hastening
his
steps
as
if
to
reach
the
other
side
of
the
port
scarcely
twenty
steps
from
the
place
of
embarking
he
fancied
in
the
darkness
that
he
recognized
the
young
man
who
had
questioned
him
athos
now
descended
the
ladder
in
his
turn
without
losing
sight
of
the
young
man
the
latter
to
make
a
short
cut
had
appeared
on
a
sluice
he
certainly
bodes
us
no
good
said
athos
but
let
us
embark
once
out
at
sea
let
him
and
athos
sprang
into
the
boat
which
was
immediately
pushed
off
and
which
soon
sped
seawards
under
the
efforts
of
four
stalwart
rowers
but
the
young
man
had
begun
to
follow
or
rather
to
advance
before
the
boat
she
was
obliged
to
pass
between
the
point
of
the
jetty
surmounted
by
a
beacon
just
lighted
and
a
rock
which
jutted
out
they
saw
him
in
the
distance
climbing
the
rock
in
order
to
look
down
upon
the
boat
as
it
passed
ay
but
said
aramis
that
young
fellow
is
decidedly
a
which
is
the
young
man
asked
de
winter
turning
around
he
who
followed
us
and
spoke
to
us
awaits
us
there
behold
de
winter
turned
and
followed
the
direction
of
aramis
s
finger
the
beacon
bathed
with
light
the
little
strait
through
which
they
were
about
to
pass
and
the
rock
where
the
young
man
stood
with
bare
head
and
crossed
arms
it
is
he
exclaimed
de
winter
seizing
the
arm
of
athos
it
is
he
i
thought
i
recognized
him
and
i
was
not
whom
do
you
mean
asked
aramis
milady
s
son
replied
athos
the
monk
exclaimed
grimaud
the
young
man
heard
these
words
and
bent
so
forward
over
the
rock
that
one
might
have
supposed
he
was
about
to
precipitate
himself
from
it
yes
it
is
i
my
uncle
i
the
son
of
milady
i
the
monk
i
the
secretary
and
friend
of
cromwell
i
know
you
now
both
you
and
your
in
that
boat
sat
three
men
unquestionably
brave
whose
courage
no
man
would
have
dared
dispute
nevertheless
at
that
voice
that
accent
and
those
gestures
they
felt
a
chill
access
of
terror
cramp
their
veins
as
for
grimaud
his
hair
stood
on
end
and
drops
of
sweat
ran
down
his
brow
ah
exclaimed
aramis
that
is
the
nephew
the
monk
and
the
son
of
milady
as
he
says
alas
yes
murmured
de
winter
then
wait
said
aramis
and
with
the
terrible
coolness
which
on
important
occasions
he
showed
he
took
one
of
the
muskets
from
tony
shouldered
and
aimed
it
at
the
young
man
who
stood
like
the
accusing
angel
upon
the
rock
fire
cried
grimaud
unconsciously
athos
threw
himself
on
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
and
arrested
the
shot
which
was
about
to
be
fired
the
devil
take
you
said
aramis
i
had
him
so
well
at
the
point
of
my
gun
i
should
have
sent
a
ball
into
his
it
is
enough
to
have
killed
the
mother
said
athos
hoarsely
the
mother
was
a
wretch
who
struck
at
us
all
and
at
those
dear
to
yes
but
the
son
has
done
us
no
grimaud
who
had
risen
to
watch
the
effect
of
the
shot
fell
back
hopeless
wringing
his
hands
the
young
man
burst
into
a
laugh
ah
it
is
certainly
you
he
cried
i
know
you
even
better
his
mocking
laugh
and
threatening
words
passed
over
their
heads
carried
by
the
breeze
until
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
horizon
aramis
shuddered
be
calm
exclaimed
athos
for
heaven
s
sake
have
we
ceased
to
be
men
no
said
aramis
but
that
fellow
is
a
fiend
and
ask
the
uncle
whether
i
was
wrong
to
rid
him
of
his
dear
de
winter
only
replied
by
a
groan
it
was
all
up
with
him
continued
aramis
ah
i
much
fear
that
with
all
your
wisdom
such
mercy
yet
will
prove
supernal
athos
took
lord
de
winter
s
hand
and
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
when
shall
we
land
in
england
he
asked
but
de
winter
seemed
not
to
hear
his
words
and
made
no
reply
hold
athos
said
aramis
perhaps
there
is
yet
time
see
if
he
is
still
in
the
same
athos
turned
around
with
an
effort
the
sight
of
the
young
man
was
evidently
painful
to
him
and
there
he
still
was
in
fact
on
the
rock
the
beacon
shedding
around
him
as
it
were
a
doubtful
aureole
decidedly
aramis
said
athos
i
think
i
was
wrong
not
to
let
you
hold
your
tongue
replied
aramis
you
would
make
me
weep
if
such
a
thing
were
at
this
moment
they
were
hailed
by
a
voice
from
the
sloop
and
a
few
seconds
later
men
servants
and
baggage
were
aboard
the
captain
was
only
waiting
for
his
passengers
hardly
had
they
put
foot
on
deck
ere
her
head
was
turned
towards
hastings
where
they
were
to
disembark
at
this
instant
the
three
friends
turned
in
spite
of
themselves
a
last
look
on
the
rock
upon
the
menacing
figure
which
pursued
them
and
now
stood
out
with
a
distinctness
still
then
a
voice
reached
them
once
more
sending
this
threat
to
our
next
meeting
sirs
in
te
deum
for
the
victory
of
lens
the
bustle
which
had
been
observed
by
henrietta
maria
and
for
which
she
had
vainly
sought
to
discover
a
reason
was
occasioned
by
the
battle
of
lens
announced
by
the
prince
s
messenger
the
duc
de
chatillon
who
had
taken
such
a
noble
part
in
the
engagement
he
was
besides
charged
to
hang
five
and
twenty
flags
taken
from
the
lorraine
party
as
well
as
from
the
spaniards
upon
the
arches
of
notre
dame
such
news
was
decisive
it
destroyed
in
favor
of
the
court
the
struggle
commenced
with
parliament
the
motive
given
for
all
the
taxes
summarily
imposed
and
to
which
the
parliament
had
made
opposition
was
the
necessity
of
sustaining
the
honor
of
france
and
the
uncertain
hope
of
beating
the
enemy
now
since
the
affair
of
nordlingen
they
had
experienced
nothing
but
reverses
the
parliament
had
a
plea
for
calling
mazarin
to
account
for
imaginary
victories
always
promised
ever
deferred
but
this
time
there
really
had
been
fighting
a
triumph
and
a
complete
one
and
this
all
knew
so
well
that
it
was
a
double
victory
for
the
court
a
victory
at
home
and
abroad
so
that
even
when
the
young
king
learned
the
news
he
exclaimed
ah
gentlemen
of
the
parliament
we
shall
see
what
you
will
say
now
upon
which
the
queen
had
pressed
the
royal
child
to
her
heart
whose
haughty
and
unruly
sentiments
were
in
such
harmony
with
her
own
a
council
was
called
on
the
same
evening
but
nothing
transpired
of
what
had
been
decided
on
it
was
only
known
that
on
the
following
sunday
a
te
deum
would
be
sung
at
notre
dame
in
honor
of
the
victory
of
lens
the
following
sunday
then
the
parisians
arose
with
joy
at
that
period
a
te
deum
was
a
grand
affair
this
kind
of
ceremony
had
not
then
been
abused
and
it
produced
a
great
effect
the
shops
were
deserted
houses
closed
every
one
wished
to
see
the
young
king
with
his
mother
and
the
famous
cardinal
mazarin
whom
they
hated
so
much
that
no
one
wished
to
be
deprived
of
his
presence
moreover
great
liberty
prevailed
throughout
the
immense
crowd
every
opinion
was
openly
expressed
and
chorused
so
to
speak
of
coming
insurrection
as
the
thousand
bells
of
all
the
paris
churches
rang
out
the
te
deum
the
police
belonging
to
the
city
being
formed
by
the
city
itself
nothing
threatening
presented
itself
to
disturb
this
concert
of
universal
hatred
or
freeze
the
frequent
scoffs
of
slanderous
lips
nevertheless
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
regiment
of
the
queen
s
guards
commanded
by
guitant
under
whom
was
his
nephew
comminges
marched
publicly
preceded
by
drums
and
trumpets
filing
off
from
the
palais
royal
as
far
as
notre
dame
a
manoeuvre
which
the
parisians
witnessed
tranquilly
delighted
as
they
were
with
military
music
and
brilliant
uniforms
friquet
had
put
on
his
sunday
clothes
under
the
pretext
of
having
a
swollen
face
which
he
had
managed
to
simulate
by
introducing
a
handful
of
cherry
kernels
into
one
side
of
his
mouth
and
had
procured
a
whole
holiday
from
bazin
on
leaving
bazin
friquet
started
off
to
the
palais
royal
where
he
arrived
at
the
moment
of
the
turning
out
of
the
regiment
of
guards
and
as
he
had
only
gone
there
for
the
enjoyment
of
seeing
it
and
hearing
the
music
he
took
his
place
at
their
head
beating
the
drum
on
two
pieces
of
slate
and
passing
from
that
exercise
to
that
of
the
trumpet
which
he
counterfeited
quite
naturally
with
his
mouth
in
a
manner
which
had
more
than
once
called
forth
the
praises
of
amateurs
of
imitative
harmony
this
amusement
lasted
from
the
barriere
des
sergens
to
the
place
of
notre
dame
and
friquet
found
in
it
very
real
enjoyment
but
when
at
last
the
regiment
separated
penetrated
the
heart
of
the
city
and
placed
itself
at
the
extremity
of
the
rue
saint
christophe
near
the
rue
cocatrix
in
which
broussel
lived
then
friquet
remembered
that
he
had
not
had
breakfast
and
after
thinking
in
which
direction
he
had
better
turn
his
steps
in
order
to
accomplish
this
important
act
of
the
day
he
reflected
deeply
and
decided
that
councillor
broussel
should
bear
the
cost
of
this
repast
in
consequence
he
took
to
his
heels
arrived
breathlessly
at
the
councillor
s
door
and
knocked
violently
his
mother
the
councillor
s
old
servant
opened
it
what
doest
thou
here
she
said
and
why
art
thou
not
at
notre
dame
i
have
been
there
mother
said
friquet
but
i
saw
things
happen
of
which
master
broussel
ought
to
be
warned
and
so
with
monsieur
bazin
s
permission
you
know
mother
monsieur
bazin
the
verger
i
came
to
speak
to
monsieur
and
what
hast
thou
to
say
boy
to
monsieur
broussel
i
wish
to
tell
him
replied
friquet
screaming
with
all
his
might
that
there
is
a
whole
regiment
of
guards
coming
this
way
and
as
i
hear
everywhere
that
at
the
court
they
are
to
him
i
wish
to
warn
him
that
he
may
be
on
his
broussel
heard
the
scream
of
the
young
oddity
and
enchanted
with
this
excess
of
zeal
came
down
to
the
first
floor
for
he
was
in
truth
working
in
his
room
on
the
second
well
said
he
friend
what
matters
the
regiment
of
guards
to
us
and
art
thou
not
mad
to
make
such
a
disturbance
knowest
thou
not
that
it
is
the
custom
of
these
soldiers
to
act
thus
and
that
it
is
usual
for
the
regiment
to
form
themselves
into
two
solid
walls
when
the
king
goes
by
friquet
counterfeited
surprise
and
twisting
his
new
cap
around
in
his
fingers
said
it
is
not
astonishing
for
you
to
know
it
monsieur
broussel
who
knows
everything
but
as
for
me
by
holy
truth
i
did
not
know
it
and
i
thought
i
would
give
you
good
advice
you
must
not
be
angry
with
me
for
that
monsieur
on
the
contrary
my
boy
on
the
contrary
i
am
pleased
with
your
zeal
dame
nanette
look
for
those
apricots
which
madame
de
longueville
sent
to
us
yesterday
from
noisy
and
give
half
a
dozen
of
them
to
your
son
with
a
crust
of
new
oh
thank
you
sir
thank
you
monsieur
broussel
said
friquet
i
am
so
fond
of
apricots
broussel
then
proceeded
to
his
wife
s
room
and
asked
for
breakfast
it
was
nine
o
clock
the
councillor
placed
himself
at
the
window
the
street
was
completely
deserted
but
in
the
distance
was
heard
like
the
noise
of
the
tide
rushing
in
the
deep
hum
of
the
populous
waves
increasing
now
around
notre
dame
this
noise
redoubled
when
d
artagnan
with
a
company
of
musketeers
placed
himself
at
the
gates
of
notre
dame
to
secure
the
service
of
the
church
he
had
instructed
porthos
to
profit
by
this
opportunity
to
see
the
ceremony
and
porthos
in
full
dress
mounted
his
finest
horse
taking
the
part
of
supernumerary
musketeer
as
d
artagnan
had
so
often
done
formerly
the
sergeant
of
this
company
a
veteran
of
the
spanish
wars
had
recognized
porthos
his
old
companion
and
very
soon
all
those
who
served
under
him
were
placed
in
possession
of
startling
facts
concerning
the
honor
of
the
ancient
musketeers
of
treville
porthos
had
not
only
been
well
received
by
the
company
but
he
was
moreover
looked
on
with
great
admiration
at
ten
o
clock
the
guns
of
the
louvre
announced
the
departure
of
the
king
and
then
a
movement
similar
to
that
of
trees
in
a
stormy
wind
that
bend
and
writhe
with
agitated
tops
ran
though
the
multitude
which
was
compressed
behind
the
immovable
muskets
of
the
guard
at
last
the
king
appeared
with
the
queen
in
a
gilded
chariot
ten
other
carriages
followed
containing
the
ladies
of
honor
the
officers
of
the
royal
household
and
the
court
god
save
the
king
was
the
cry
in
every
direction
the
young
monarch
gravely
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
looked
sufficiently
grateful
and
even
bowed
at
which
the
cries
of
the
multitude
were
renewed
just
as
the
court
was
settling
down
in
the
cathedral
a
carriage
bearing
the
arms
of
comminges
quitted
the
line
of
the
court
carriages
and
proceeded
slowly
to
the
end
of
the
rue
saint
christophe
now
entirely
deserted
when
it
arrived
there
four
guards
and
a
police
officer
who
accompanied
it
mounted
into
the
heavy
machine
and
closed
the
shutters
then
through
an
opening
cautiously
made
the
policeman
began
to
watch
the
length
of
the
rue
cocatrix
as
if
he
was
waiting
for
some
one
all
the
world
was
occupied
with
the
ceremony
so
that
neither
the
chariot
nor
the
precautions
taken
by
those
who
were
within
it
had
been
observed
friquet
whose
eye
ever
on
the
alert
could
alone
have
discovered
them
had
gone
to
devour
his
apricots
upon
the
entablature
of
a
house
in
the
square
of
notre
dame
thence
he
saw
the
king
the
queen
and
monsieur
mazarin
and
heard
the
mass
as
well
as
if
he
had
been
on
duty
toward
the
end
of
the
service
the
queen
seeing
comminges
standing
near
her
waiting
for
a
confirmation
of
the
order
she
had
given
him
before
quitting
the
louvre
said
in
a
whisper
go
comminges
and
may
god
aid
you
comminges
immediately
left
the
church
and
entered
the
rue
saint
christophe
friquet
seeing
this
fine
officer
thus
walk
away
followed
by
two
guards
amused
himself
by
pursuing
them
and
did
this
so
much
the
more
gladly
as
the
ceremony
ended
at
that
instant
and
the
king
remounted
his
carriage
hardly
had
the
police
officer
observed
comminges
at
the
end
of
the
rue
cocatrix
when
he
said
one
word
to
the
coachman
who
at
once
put
his
vehicle
into
motion
and
drove
up
before
broussel
s
door
comminges
knocked
at
the
door
at
the
same
moment
and
friquet
was
waiting
behind
comminges
until
the
door
should
be
opened
what
dost
thou
there
rascal
asked
comminges
i
want
to
go
into
master
broussel
s
house
captain
replied
friquet
in
that
wheedling
way
the
gamins
of
paris
know
so
well
how
to
assume
when
necessary
and
on
what
floor
does
he
live
asked
comminges
in
the
whole
house
said
friquet
the
house
belongs
to
him
he
occupies
the
second
floor
when
he
works
and
descends
to
the
first
to
take
his
meals
he
must
be
at
dinner
now
it
is
good
said
comminges
at
this
moment
the
door
was
opened
and
having
questioned
the
servant
the
officer
learned
that
master
broussel
was
at
home
and
at
dinner
broussel
was
seated
at
the
table
with
his
family
having
his
wife
opposite
to
him
his
two
daughters
by
his
side
and
his
son
louvieres
whom
we
have
already
seen
when
the
accident
happened
to
the
councillor
an
accident
from
which
he
had
quite
recovered
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
the
worthy
man
restored
to
perfect
health
was
tasting
the
fine
fruit
which
madame
de
longueville
had
sent
to
him
at
sight
of
the
officer
broussel
was
somewhat
moved
but
seeing
him
bow
politely
he
rose
and
bowed
also
still
in
spite
of
this
reciprocal
politeness
the
countenances
of
the
women
betrayed
a
certain
amount
of
uneasiness
louvieres
became
very
pale
and
waited
impatiently
for
the
officer
to
explain
himself
sir
said
comminges
i
am
the
bearer
of
an
order
from
the
very
well
sir
replied
broussel
what
is
this
order
and
he
held
out
his
hand
i

said
comminges
in
the
same
tone
and
with
the
same
politeness
and
if
you
will
believe
me
you
had
better
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
reading
that
long
letter
and
follow
a
thunderbolt
falling
in
the
midst
of
these
good
people
so
peacefully
assembled
there
would
not
have
produced
a
more
appalling
effect
it
was
a
horrible
thing
at
that
period
to
be
imprisoned
by
the
enmity
of
the
king
louvieres
sprang
forward
to
snatch
his
sword
which
stood
against
a
chair
in
a
corner
of
the
room
but
a
glance
from
the
worthy
broussel
who
in
the
midst
of
it
all
did
not
lose
his
presence
of
mind
checked
this
foolhardy
action
of
despair
madame
broussel
separated
by
the
width
of
the

from

sprang
to
the
window

and
in

a
piercing
voice
that

might
have
been

cried
broussel
trying
to
disengage
himself
from
the
grasp
of
his
two
daughters
and
by
a
look
restrain
his
son
who
seemed
determined
to
dispute
authority
in
that
case
commanded
comminges
silence
that
old
ah
old
woman
screamed
nanette
and
she
began
to
shriek
more
loudly

to
the
bars
of
the
window

master
broussel
who
is
arrested
because

comminges
seized
the
servant
around
the
waist
and
would
have
dragged
her
from
her
post
but
at
that
instant
a
treble
voice
proceeding
from
a
kind
of
entresol
was
heard
screeching
murder
fire
assassins
master
broussel
is
being
killed
master
broussel
is
being
it
was
friquet
s
voice
and
dame
nanette
feeling
herself
supported
recommenced
with
all
her
strength
to
sound
her
shrilly
squawk
many
curious
faces
had
already
appeared
at
the
windows
and
the
people
attracted
to
the
end
of
the
street
began
to
run
first
men
then
groups
and
then
a
crowd
of
people
hearing
cries
and
seeing
a
chariot
they
could
not
understand
it
but
friquet
sprang
from
the
entresol
on
to
the
top
of
the
carriage
they
want
to
arrest
master
broussel
he
cried
the
guards
are
in
the
carriage
and
the
officer
is
upstairs
the
crowd
began
to
murmur
and
approached
the
house
the
two
guards
who
had
remained
in
the
lane
mounted
to
the
aid
of
comminges
those
who
were
in
the
chariot
opened
the
doors
and
presented
arms
don
t
you
see
them
cried
friquet
don
t
you
see
there
they
are
the
coachman
turning
around
gave
friquet
a
slash
with
his
whip
which
made
him
scream
with
pain
ah
devil
s
coachman
cried
friquet
you
re
meddling
too
wait
and
regaining
his
entresol
he
overwhelmed
the
coachman
with
every
projectile
he
could
lay
hands
on
the
tumult
now
began
to
increase
the
street
was
not
able
to
contain
the
spectators
who
assembled
from
every
direction
the
crowd
invaded
the
space
which
the
dreaded
pikes
of
the
guards
had
till
then
kept
clear
between
them
and
the
carriage
the
soldiers
pushed
back
by
these
living
walls
were
in
danger
of
being
crushed
against
the
spokes
of
the
wheels
and
the
panels
of
the
carriages
the
cries
which
the
police
officer
repeated
twenty
times
in
the
king
s
name
were
powerless
against
this
formidable
multitude
seemed
on
the
contrary
to
exasperate
it
still
more
when
at
the
shout
in
the
name
of
the
king
an
officer
ran
up
and
seeing
the
uniforms
he
sprang
into
the
scuffle
sword
in
hand
and
brought
unexpected
help
to
the
guards
this
gentleman
was
a
young
man
scarcely
sixteen
years
of
age
now
white
with
anger
he
leaped
from
his
charger
placed
his
back
against
the
shaft
of
the
carriage
making
a
rampart
of
his
horse
drew
his
pistols
from
their
holsters
and
fastened
them
to
his
belt
and
began
to
fight
with
the
back
sword
like
a
man
accustomed
to
the
handling
of
his
weapon
during
ten
minutes
he
alone
kept
the
crowd
at
bay
at
last
comminges
appeared
pushing
broussel
before
him
let
us
break
the
carriage
cried
the
people
in
the
king
s
name
cried
comminges
the
first
who
advances
is
a
dead
man
cried
raoul
for
it
was
in
fact
he
who
feeling
himself
pressed
and
almost
crushed
by
a
gigantic
citizen
pricked
him
with
the
point
of
his
sword
and
sent
him
howling
back
comminges
so
to
speak
threw
broussel
into
the
carriage
and
sprang
in
after
him
at
this
moment
a
shot
was
fired
and
a
ball
passed
through
the
hat
of
comminges
and
broke
the
arm
of
one
of
the
guards
comminges
looked
up
and
saw
amidst
the
smoke
the
threatening
face
of
louvieres
appearing
at
the
window
of
the
second
floor
very
well
sir
said
comminges
you
shall
hear
of
this
and
you
of
me
sir
said
louvieres
and
we
shall
see
then
who
can
speak
the
friquet
and
nanette
continued
to
shout
the
cries
the
noise
of
the
shot
and
the
intoxicating
smell
of
powder
produced
their
usual
maddening
effects
down
with
the
officer
down
with
him
was
the
cry
one
step
nearer
said
comminges
putting
down
the
sashes
that
the
interior
of
the
carriage
might
be
well
seen
and
placing
his
sword
on
his
prisoner
s
breast
one
step
nearer
and
i
kill
the
prisoner
my
orders
were
to
carry
him
off
alive
or
dead
i
will
take
him
dead
that
s
a
terrible
cry
was
heard
and
the
wife
and
daughters
of
broussel
held
up
their
hands
in
supplication
to
the
people
the
latter
knew
that
this
officer
who
was
so
pale
but
who
appeared
so
determined
would
keep
his
word
they
continued
to
threaten
but
they
began
to
disperse
drive
to
the
palace
said
comminges
to
the
coachman
who
was
by
then
more
dead
than
alive
the
man
whipped
his
animals
which
cleared
a
way
through
the
crowd
but
on
arriving
on
the
quai
they
were
obliged
to
stop
the
carriage
was
upset
the
horses
carried
off
stifled
mangled
by
the
crowd
raoul
on
foot
for
he
had
not
time
to
mount
his
horse
again
tired
like
the
guards
of
distributing
blows
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
had
recourse
to
its
point
but
this
last
and
dreaded
resource
served
only
to
exasperate
the
multitude
from
time
to
time
a
shot
from
a
musket
or
the
blade
of
a
rapier
flashed
among
the
crowd
projectiles
continued
to
hail
down
from
the
windows
and
some
shots
were
heard
the
echo
of
which
though
they
were
probably
fired
in
the
air
made
all
hearts
vibrate
voices
unheard
except
on
days
of
revolution
were
distinguished
faces
were
seen
that
only
appeared
on
days
of
bloodshed
cries
of
death
death
to
the
guards
to
the
seine
with
the
officer
were
heard
above
all
the
noise
deafening
as
it
was
raoul
his
hat
in
ribbons
his
face
bleeding
felt
not
only
his
strength
but
also
his
reason
going
a
red
mist
covered
his
sight
and
through
this
mist
he
saw
a
hundred
threatening
arms
stretched
over
him
ready
to
seize
upon
him
when
he
fell
the
guards
were
unable
to
help
any
one
each
one
was
occupied
with
his
all
was
over
carriages
horses
guards
and
perhaps
even
the
prisoner
were
about
to
be
torn
to
shreds
when
all
at
once
a
voice
well
known
to
raoul
was
heard
and
suddenly
a
great
sword
glittered
in
the
air
at
the
same
time
the
crowd
opened
upset
trodden
down
and
an
officer
of
the
musketeers
striking
and
cutting
right
and
left
rushed
up
to
raoul
and
took
him
in
his
arms
just
as
he
was
about
to
fall
god
s
blood
cried
the
officer
have
they
killed
him
woe
to
them
if
it
be
so
and
he
turned
around
so
stern
with
anger
strength
and
threat
that
the
most
excited
rebels
hustled
back
on
one
another
in
order
to
escape
and
some
of
them
even
rolled
into
the
seine
monsieur
d
artagnan
murmured
raoul
yes
sdeath
in
person
and
fortunately
it
seems
for
you
my
young
friend
come
on
here
you
others
he
continued
rising
in
his
stirrups
raising
his
sword
and
addressing
those
musketeers
who
had
not
been
able
to
follow
his
rapid
onslaught
come
sweep
away
all
that
for
me
shoulder
muskets
present
arms
aim
at
this
command
the
mountain
of
populace
thinned
so
suddenly
that
d
artagnan
could
not
repress
a
burst
of
homeric
laughter
thank
you
d
artagnan
said
comminges
showing
half
of
his
body
through
the
window
of
the
broken
vehicle
thanks

young
friend
your
name
that
i
may
mention

when
d
artagnan
bent
down
to
his
ear
hold
your
tongue
said
he
and
let
me
answer

not
lose
time
comminges
he
continued
get
out
of
the
carriage
if
you
can
and
make
another
draw
up
be
quick
or
in
five
minutes
the
mob
will
be
on
us
again
with
swords
and
muskets
and
you
will
be
killed
hold
there
s
a
carriage
coming
over
then
bending
again
to
raoul
he
whispered
above
all
things

that

right
i
will
go
said
comminges
and
if
they
come
back

replied
d
artagnan
let
no
one
move
on
the
contrary
one
shot
at
this
moment
would
be
paid
for
dearly
comminges
took
his
four
guards
and
as
many
musketeers
and
ran
to
the
carriage
from
which
he
made
the
people
inside
dismount
and
brought
them
to
the
vehicle
which
had
upset
but
when
it
was
necessary
to
convey
the
prisoner
from
one
carriage
to
the
other
the
people
catching
sight
of
him
whom
they
called
their
liberator
uttered
every
imaginable
cry
and
knotted
themselves
once
more
around
the
vehicle
start
start
said
d
artagnan
there
are
ten
men
to
accompany
you
i
will
keep
twenty
to
hold
in
check
the
mob
go
and
lose
not
a
moment
ten
men
for
monsieur
de
as
the
carriage
started
off
the
cries
were
redoubled
and
more
than
ten
thousand
people
thronged
the
quai
and
overflowed
the
pont
neuf
and
adjacent
streets
a
few
shots
were
fired
and
one
musketeer
was
wounded
forward
cried
d
artagnan
driven
to
extremities
biting
his
moustache
and
then
he
charged
with
his
twenty
men
and
dispersed
them
in
fear
one
man
alone
remained
in
his
place
gun
in
hand
ah
he
exclaimed
it
is
thou
who
wouldst
have
him
assassinated
wait
an
and
he
pointed
his
gun
at
d
artagnan
who
was
riding
toward
him
at
full
speed
d
artagnan
bent
down
to
his
horse
s
neck
the
young
man
fired
and
the
ball
severed
the
feathers
from
the
hat
the
horse
started
brushed
against
the
imprudent
man
who
thought
by
his
strength
alone
to
stay
the
tempest
and
he
fell
against
the
wall
d
artagnan
pulled
up
his
horse
and
whilst
his
musketeers
continued
to
charge
he
returned
and
bent
with
drawn
sword
over
the
man
he
had
knocked
down
oh

exclaimed
raoul
recognizing
the
young
man
as
having
seen
him
in
the
rue
cocatrix

him

is
his
son
d
artagnan
s
arm
dropped
to
his
side

and
quickly
if

the
young
man
did
not
wait
to
be
told
twice
but
passing
under
the
horse
s
head
disappeared
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
guenegaud
i
faith
said
d
artagnan
to
raoul
you
were
just
in
time
to
stay
my
hand
he
was
a
dead
man
and
on
my
honor
if

that

was
his
son

should
have
regretted

almost
dead
when
you
wait

young
man
do
not
fatigue
yourself
with
speaking

can
talk
of
it
then
seeing
that
the
musketeers
had
cleared
the
quai
from
the
pont
neuf
to
the
quai
saint
michael
he
raised
his
sword
for
them
to
double
their
speed
the
musketeers
trotted
up
and
at
the
same
time
the
ten
men
whom
d
artagnan
had
given
to
comminges
appeared

cried
d

the
sergeant

second
time
it
really
must
be
they

bad
managers
said
d
artagnan
shrugging
his
shoulders
when
a
carriage
is
chosen
it
ought
to
be
strong
the
carriage
in
which
a
broussel
is
to
be
arrested
ought
to
be
able
to
bear
ten
thousand
what

but

so
you
suppose
i
have
need
of
an
escort
the
musketeers
set
off
and
d
artagnan
was
left
alone
with
raoul
now
he
said
are
you
in
pain
yes
my
head
is
not
only
swimming
but
what

cried
d
artagnan

that
friquet
heard
perfectly
but
he
pretended
not
to
do
so
and
tried
to
continue
his
road
d
artagnan
felt
inclined
for
an
instant
to
pursue
master
friquet
but
not
wishing
to
leave
raoul
alone
he
contented
himself
with
taking
a
pistol
from
the
holster
and
cocking
it
friquet
had
a
quick
eye
and
a
fine
ear
he
saw
d
artagnan
s
movement
heard
the
sound
of
the
click
and
stopped
at
once
ah

honor
he
said
advancing
toward
d
artagnan
and
i
am

pleased
to

attentively
at

and
recognized

little
chorister
of
the

friquet
i
was
seeking
the
gentleman
to
whom
this
horse
belongs
an
officer
brave
and
handsome
as
a
youthful
caesar
then
pretending
to
see
raoul
for
the
first
time
ah
but
if
i
mistake
not
continued
he
here
he
is
you
won
t
forget
the
boy
raoul
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
what
are
you
about
asked
d
artagnan
to
give
ten
francs
to
this
honest
fellow
replied
raoul
taking
a
pistole
from
his
pocket
ten
kicks
on
his
back
said
d
artagnan
be
off
you
little
villain
and
forget
not
that
i
have
your
friquet
who
did
not
expect
to
be
let
off
so
cheaply
bounded
off
like
a
gazelle
up
the
quai
a
la
rue
dauphine
and
disappeared
raoul
mounted
his
horse
and
both
leisurely
took
their
way
to
the
rue
tiquetonne
d
artagnan
watched
over
the
youth
as
if
he
had
been
his
own
son
they
arrived
without
accident
at
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
the
handsome
madeleine
announced
to
d
artagnan
that
planchet
had
returned
bringing
mousqueton
with
him
who
had
heroically
borne
the
extraction
of
the
ball
and
was
as
well
as
his
state
would
permit
d
artagnan
desired
planchet
to
be
summoned
but
he
had
disappeared
then
bring
some
wine
said
d
artagnan
you
are
much
pleased
with
yourself
said
he
to
raoul
when
they
were
alone
are
you
not
well
yes
replied
raoul
it
seems
to
me
i
did
my
duty
i
defended
the
and
who
told
you
to
defend
the
king
the
comte
de
la
fere
yes
the
king
but
you
have
not
fought
for
the
king
you
have
fought
for
mazarin
which
is
not
quite
the
same
but
you
yourself
oh
for
me
that
is
another
matter
i
obey
my
captain
s
orders
as
for
you
your
captain
is
the
prince
understand
that
rightly
you
have
no
other
but
has
one
ever
seen
such
a
wild
fellow
continued
he
making
himself
a
mazarinist
and
helping
to
arrest
broussel
breathe
not
a
word
of
that
or
the
comte
de
la
fere
will
be
you
think
the
count
will
be
angry
with
me
think
it
i
m
certain
of
it
were
it
not
for
that
i
should
thank
you
for
you
have
worked
for
us
however
i
scold
you
instead
of
him
and
in
his
place
the
storm
will
blow
over
more
easily
believe
me
and
moreover
my
dear
child
continued
d
artagnan
i
am
making
use
of
the
privilege
conceded
to
me
by
your
i
do
not
understand
you
sir
said
raoul
d
artagnan
rose
and
taking
a
letter
from
his
presented
it
to
raoul
the
face
of
the
latter
became
serious
when
he
had
cast
his
eyes
upon
the
paper
oh
mon
dieu
he
said
raising
his
fine
eyes
to
d
artagnan
moist
with
tears
the
count
has
left
paris
without
seeing
me
he
left
four
days
ago
said
d
artagnan
but
this
letter
seems
to
intimate
that
he
is
about
to
incur
danger
perhaps
he
he
incur
danger
of
death
no
be
not
anxious
he
is
traveling
on
business
and
will
return
ere
long
i
hope
you
have
no
repugnance
to
accept
me
as
your
guardian
in
the
oh
no
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
raoul
you
are
such
a
brave
gentleman
and
the
comte
de
la
fere
has
so
much
affection
for
you
eh
egad
love
me
too
i
will
not
torment
you
much
but
only
on
condition
that
you
become
a
frondist
my
young
friend
and
a
hearty
frondist
but
can
i
continue
to
visit
madame
de
chevreuse
i
should
say
you
could
and
the
coadjutor
and
madame
de
longueville
and
if
the
worthy
broussel
were
there
whom
you
so
stupidly
helped
arrest
i
should
tell
you
to
excuse
yourself
to
him
at
once
and
kiss
him
on
both
well
sir
i
will
obey
you
although
i
do
not
understand
it
is
unnecessary
for
you
to
understand
hold
continued
d
artagnan
turning
toward
the
door
which
had
just
opened
here
is
monsieur
du
vallon
who
comes
with
his
coat
yes
but
in
exchange
said
porthos
covered
with
perspiration
and
soiled
by
dust
in
exchange
i
have
torn
many
skins
those
wretches
wanted
to
take
away
my
sword
deuce
take
em
what
a
popular
commotion
continued
the
giant
in
his
quiet
manner
but
i
knocked
down
more
than
twenty
with
the
hilt
of
balizarde
a
draught
of
wine
d
oh
i
ll
answer
for
you
said
the
gascon
filling
porthos
s
glass
to
the
brim
but
when
you
have
drunk
give
me
your
upon
what
asked
porthos
look
here
resumed
d
artagnan
here
is
monsieur
de
bragelonne
who
determined
at
all
risks
to
aid
the
arrest
of
broussel
and
whom
i
had
great
difficulty
to
prevent
defending
monsieur
de
the
devil
said
porthos
and
his
guardian
what
would
he
have
said
to
that
do
you
hear
interrupted
d
artagnan
become
a
frondist
my
friend
belong
to
the
fronde
and
remember
that
i
fill
the
count
s
place
in
everything
and
he
jingled
his
money
will
you
come
said
he
to
porthos
where
asked
porthos
filling
a
second
glass
of
wine
to
present
our
respects
to
the
porthos
swallowed
the
second
glass
with
the
same
grace
with
which
he
had
imbibed
the
first
took
his
beaver
and
followed
d
artagnan
as
for
raoul
he
remained
bewildered
with
what
he
had
seen
having
been
forbidden
by
d
artagnan
to
leave
the
room
until
the
tumult
was
over
the
beggar
of
eustache
d
artagnan
had
calculated
that
in
not
going
at
once
to
the
palais
royal
he
would
give
comminges
time
to
arrive
before
him
and
consequently
to
make
the
cardinal
acquainted
with
the
eminent
services
which
he
d
artagnan
and
his
friend
had
rendered
to
the
queen
s
party
in
the
morning
they
were
indeed
admirably
received
by
mazarin
who
paid
them
numerous
compliments
and
announced
that
they
were
more
than
half
on
their
way
to
obtain
what
they
desired
namely
d
artagnan
his
captaincy
porthos
his
barony
d
artagnan
would
have
preferred
money
in
hand
to
all
that
fine
talk
for
he
knew
well
that
to
mazarin
it
was
easy
to
promise
and
hard
to
perform
but
though
he
held
the
cardinal
s
promises
as
of
little
worth
he
affected
to
be
completely
satisfied
for
he
was
unwilling
to
discourage
porthos
whilst
the
two
friends
were
with
the
cardinal
the
queen
sent
for
him
mazarin
thinking
that
it
would
be
the
means
of
increasing
the
zeal
of
his
two
defenders
if
he
procured
them
personal
thanks
from
the
queen
motioned
them
to
follow
him
d
artagnan
and
porthos
pointed
to
their
dusty
and
torn
dresses
but
the
cardinal
shook
his
head
those
costumes
he
said
are
of
more
worth
than
most
of
those
which
you
will
see
on
the
backs
of
the
queen
s
courtiers
they
are
costumes
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
obeyed
the
court
of
anne
of
austria
was
full
of
gayety
and
animation
for
after
having
gained
a
victory
over
the
spaniard
it
had
just
gained
another
over
the
people
broussel
had
been
conducted
out
of
paris
without
further
resistance
and
was
at
this
time
in
the
prison
of
saint
germain
while
blancmesnil
who
was
arrested
at
the
same
time
but
whose
arrest
had
been
made
without
difficulty
or
noise
was
safe
in
the
castle
of
vincennes
comminges
was
near
the
queen
who
was
questioning
him
upon
the
details
of
his
expedition
and
every
one
was
listening
to
his
account
when
d
artagnan
and
porthos
were
perceived
at
the
door
behind
the
cardinal
ah
madame
said
comminges
hastening
to
d
artagnan
here
is
one
who
can
tell
you
better
than
myself
for
he
was
my
protector
without
him
i
should
probably
at
this
moment
be
a
dead
fish
in
the
nets
at
saint
cloud
for
it
was
a
question
of
nothing
less
than
throwing
me
into
the
river
speak
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
had
been
a
hundred
times
in
the
same
room
with
the
queen
since
he
had
become
lieutenant
of
the
musketeers
but
her
majesty
had
never
once
spoken
to
him
well
sir
at
last
said
anne
of
austria
you
are
silent
after
rendering
such
a
service
madame
replied
d
artagnan
i
have
nought
to
say
save
that
my
life
is
ever
at
your
majesty
s
service
and
that
i
shall
only
be
happy
the
day
i
lose
it
for
i
know
that
sir
i
have
known
that
said
the
queen
a
long
time
therefore
i
am
delighted
to
be
able
thus
publicly
to
mark
my
gratitude
and
my
permit
me
madame
said
d
artagnan
to
reserve
a
portion
for
my
friend
like
myself
he
laid
an
emphasis
on
these
words
an
ancient
musketeer
of
the
company
of
treville
he
has
done
his
name
asked
the
queen
in
the
regiment
said
d
artagnan
he
is
called
porthos
the
queen
started
but
his
true
name
is
the
chevalier
du
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
added
porthos
these
names
are
too
numerous
for
me
to
remember
them
all
and
i
will
content
myself
with
the
first
said
the
queen
graciously
porthos
bowed
at
this
moment
the
coadjutor
was
announced
a
cry
of
surprise
ran
through
the
royal
assemblage
although
the
coadjutor
had
preached
that
same
morning
it
was
well
known
that
he
leaned
much
to
the
side
of
the
fronde
and
mazarin
in
requesting
the
archbishop
of
paris
to
make
his
nephew
preach
had
evidently
had
the
intention
of
administering
to
monsieur
de
retz
one
of
those
italian
kicks
he
so
much
enjoyed
giving
the
fact
was
in
leaving
notre
dame
the
coadjutor
had
learned
the
event
of
the
day
although
almost
engaged
to
the
leaders
of
the
fronde
he
had
not
gone
so
far
but
that
retreat
was
possible
should
the
court
offer
him
the
advantages
for
which
he
was
ambitious
and
to
which
the
coadjutorship
was
but
a
monsieur
de
retz
wished
to
become
archbishop
in
his
uncle
s
place
and
cardinal
like
mazarin
and
the
popular
party
could
with
difficulty
accord
him
favors
so
entirely
royal
he
therefore
hastened
to
the
palace
to
congratulate
the
queen
on
the
battle
of
lens
determined
beforehand
to
act
with
or
against
the
court
as
his
congratulations
were
well
or
ill
received
the
coadjutor
possessed
perhaps
as
much
wit
as
all
those
put
together
who
were
assembled
at
the
court
to
laugh
at
him
his
speech
therefore
was
so
well
turned
that
in
spite
of
the
great
wish
felt
by
the
courtiers
to
laugh
they
could
find
no
point
on
which
to
vent
their
ridicule
he
concluded
by
saying
that
he
placed
his
feeble
influence
at
her
majesty
s
command
during
the
whole
time
he
was
speaking
the
queen
appeared
to
be
well
pleased
with
the
coadjutor
s
harangue
but
terminating
as
it
did
with
such
a
phrase
the
only
one
which
could
be
caught
at
by
the
jokers
anne
turned
around
and
directed
a
glance
toward
her
favorites
which
announced
that
she
delivered
up
the
coadjutor
to
their
tender
mercies
immediately
the
wits
of
the
court
plunged
into
satire
the
fool
of
the
court
exclaimed
that
the
queen
was
very
happy
to
have
the
succor
of
religion
at
such
a
this
caused
a
universal
burst
of
laughter
the
count
de
villeroy
said
that
he
did
not
know
how
any
fear
could
be
entertained
for
a
moment
when
the
court
had
to
defend
itself
against
the
parliament
and
the
citizens
of
paris
his
holiness
the
coadjutor
who
by
a
signal
could
raise
an
army
of
curates
church
porters
and
the
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
added
that
in
case
the
coadjutor
should
appear
on
the
field
of
battle
it
would
be
a
pity
that
he
should
not
be
distinguished
in
the
melee
by
wearing
a
red
hat
as
henry
iv
had
been
distinguished
by
his
white
plume
at
the
battle
of
ivry
during
this
storm
gondy
who
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
it
most
unpleasant
for
the
jesters
remained
calm
and
stern
the
queen
at
last
asked
him
if
he
had
anything
to
add
to
the
fine
discourse
he
had
just
made
to
her
yes
madame
replied
the
coadjutor
i
have
to
beg
you
to
reflect
twice
ere
you
cause
a
civil
war
in
the
the
queen
turned
her
back
and
the
laughing
recommenced
the
coadjutor
bowed
and
left
the
palace
casting
upon
the
cardinal
such
a
glance
as
is
best
understood
by
mortal
foes
that
glance
was
so
sharp
that
it
penetrated
the
heart
of
mazarin
who
reading
in
it
a
declaration
of
war
seized
d
artagnan
by
the
arm
and
said
if
occasion
requires
monsieur
you
will
remember
that
man
who
has
just
gone
out
will
you
not
yes
my
lord
he
replied
then
turning
toward
porthos
the
devil
said
he
this
has
a
bad
look
i
dislike
these
quarrels
among
men
of
the
gondy
withdrew
distributing
benedictions
on
his
way
and
finding
a
malicious
satisfaction
in
causing
the
adherents
of
his
foes
to
prostrate
themselves
at
his
feet
oh
he
murmured
as
he
left
the
threshold
of
the
palace
ungrateful
court
faithless
court
cowardly
court
i
will
teach
you
how
to
laugh
but
in
another
but
whilst
they
were
indulging
in
extravagant
joy
at
the
palais
royal
to
increase
the
hilarity
of
the
queen
mazarin
a
man
of
sense
and
whose
fear
moreover
gave
him
foresight
lost
no
time
in
making
idle
and
dangerous
jokes
he
went
out
after
the
coadjutor
settled
his
account
locked
up
his
gold
and
had
confidential
workmen
to
contrive
hiding
places
in
his
walls
on
his
return
home
the
coadjutor
was
informed
that
a
young
man
had
come
in
after
his
departure
and
was
waiting
for
him
he
started
with
delight
when
on
demanding
the
name
of
this
young
man
he
learned
that
it
was
louvieres
he
hastened
to
his
cabinet
broussel
s
son
was
there
still
furious
and
still
bearing
bloody
marks
of
his
struggle
with
the
king
s
officers
the
only
precaution
he
had
taken
in
coming
to
the
archbishopric
was
to
leave
his
arquebuse
in
the
hands
of
a
friend
the
coadjutor
went
to
him
and
held
out
his
hand
the
young
man
gazed
at
him
as
if
he
would
have
read
the
secret
of
his
heart
my
dear
monsieur
louvieres
said
the
coadjutor
believe
me
i
am
truly
concerned
for
the
misfortune
which
has
happened
to
is
that
true
and
do
you
speak
seriously
asked
louvieres
from
the
depth
of
my
heart
said
gondy
in
that
case
my
lord
the
time
for
words
has
passed
and
the
hour
for
action
is
at
hand
my
lord
in
three
days
if
you
wish
it
my
father
will
be
out
of
prison
and
in
six
months
you
may
be
the
coadjutor
started
oh
let
us
speak
frankly
continued
louvieres
and
act
in
a
straightforward
manner
thirty
thousand
crowns
in
alms
is
not
given
as
you
have
done
for
the
last
six
months
out
of
pure
christian
charity
that
would
be
too
grand
you
are
ambitious
it
is
natural
you
are
a
man
of
genius
and
you
know
your
worth
as
for
me
i
hate
the
court
and
have
but
one
desire
at
this
moment
vengeance
give
us
the
clergy
and
the
people
of
whom
you
can
dispose
and
i
will
bring
you
the
citizens
and
the
parliament
with
these
four
elements
paris
is
ours
in
a
week
and
believe
me
monsieur
coadjutor
the
court
will
give
from
fear
what
it
will
not
give
from
it
was
now
the
coadjutor
s
turn
to
fix
his
piercing
eyes
on
louvieres
but
monsieur
louvieres
are
you
aware
that
it
is
simply
civil
war
you
are
proposing
to
me
you
have
been
preparing
long
enough
my
lord
for
it
to
be
welcome
to
you
never
mind
said
the
coadjutor
you
must
be
well
aware
that
this
requires
and
how
many
hours
of
reflection
do
you
ask
twelve
hours
sir
is
it
too
long
it
is
now
noon
at
midnight
i
will
be
at
your
if
i
should
not
be
in
wait
for
good
at
midnight
my
at
midnight
my
dear
monsieur
when
once
more
alone
gondy
sent
to
summon
all
the
curates
with
whom
he
had
any
connection
to
his
house
two
hours
later
thirty
officiating
ministers
from
the
most
populous
and
consequently
the
most
disturbed
parishes
of
paris
had
assembled
there
gondy
related
to
them
the
insults
he
had
received
at
the
palais
royal
and
retailed
the
jests
of
beautin
the
count
de
villeroy
and
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
the
curates
asked
him
what
was
to
be
done
simply
this
said
the
coadjutor
you
are
the
directors
of
all
consciences
well
undermine
in
them
the
miserable
prejudice
of
respect
and
fear
of
kings
teach
your
flocks
that
the
queen
is
a
tyrant
and
repeat
often
and
loudly
so
that
all
may
know
it
that
the
misfortunes
of
france
are
caused
by
mazarin
her
lover
and
her
destroyer
begin
this
work
this
instant
even
and
in
three
days
i
shall
expect
the
result
for
the
rest
if
any
one
of
you
have
further
or
better
counsel
to
expound
i
will
listen
to
him
with
the
greatest
three
curates
remained
those
of
merri
sulpice
and
eustache
the
others
withdrew
you
think
then
that
you
can
help
me
more
efficaciously
than
your
brothers
said
gondy
we
hope
so
answered
the
curates
let
us
hear
monsieur
de
merri
you
my
lord
i
have
in
my
parish
a
man
who
might
be
of
the
greatest
use
to
who
and
what
is
this
man
a
shopkeeper
in
the
rue
des
lombards
who
has
great
influence
upon
the
commerce
of
his
what
is
his
name
he
is
named
planchet
who
himself
also
caused
a
rising
about
six
weeks
ago
but
as
he
was
searched
for
after
this
emeute
he
and
can
you
find
him
i
hope
so
i
think
he
has
not
been
arrested
and
as
i
am
his
wife
s
confessor
if
she
knows
where
he
is
i
shall
know
it
very
well
sir
find
this
man
and
when
you
have
found
him
bring
him
to
we
will
be
with
you
at
six
o
clock
my
go
my
dear
curate
and
may
god
assist
you
and
you
sir
continued
gondy
turning
to
the
curate
of
sulpice
i
my
lord
said
the
latter
i
know
a
man
who
has
rendered
great
services
to
a
very
popular
prince
and
who
would
make
an
excellent
leader
of
revolt
him
i
can
place
at
your
disposal
it
is
count
de
i
know
him
also
but
unfortunately
he
is
not
in
my
lord
he
has
been
for
three
days
at
the
rue
and
wherefore
has
he
not
been
to
see
me
he
was
told
my
lord
will
pardon
me
certainly
that
your
lordship
was
about
to
treat
with
the
gondy
bit
his
lips
they
are
mistaken
bring
him
here
at
eight
o
clock
sir
and
may
heaven
bless
you
as
i
bless
you
and
now
tis
your
turn
said
the
coadjutor
turning
to
the
last
that
remained
have
you
anything
as
good
to
offer
me
as
the
two
gentlemen
who
have
left
us
better
my
diable
think
what
a
solemn
engagement
you
are
making
one
has
offered
a
wealthy
shopkeeper
the
other
a
count
you
are
going
then
to
offer
a
prince
are
you
i
offer
you
a
beggar
my
ah
ah
said
gondy
reflecting
you
are
right
sir
some
one
who
could
raise
the
legion
of
paupers
who
choke
up
the
crossings
of
paris
some
one
who
would
know
how
to
cry
aloud
to
them
that
all
france
might
hear
it
that
it
is
mazarin
who
has
reduced
them
to
exactly
your
bravo
and
the
man
a
plain
and
simple
beggar
as
i
have
said
my
lord
who
asks
for
alms
as
he
gives
holy
water
a
practice
he
has
carried
on
for
six
years
on
the
steps
of
and
you
say
that
he
has
a
great
influence
over
his
compeers
are
you
aware
my
lord
that
mendacity
is
an
organized
body
a
kind
of
association
of
those
who
have
nothing
against
those
who
have
everything
an
association
in
which
every
one
takes
his
share
one
that
elects
a
leader
yes
i
have
heard
it
said
replied
the
coadjutor
well
the
man
whom
i
offer
you
is
a
general
and
what
do
you
know
of
him
nothing
my
lord
except
that
he
is
tormented
with
what
makes
you
think
so
on
the
of
every
month
he
makes
me
say
a
mass
for
the
repose
of
the
soul
of
one
who
died
a
violent
death
yesterday
i
said
this
mass
and
his
name
maillard
but
i
do
not
think
it
is
his
right
and
think
you
that
we
should
find
him
at
this
hour
at
his
post
let
us
go
and
see
your
beggar
sir
and
if
he
is
such
as
you
describe
him
you
are
right
it
will
be
you
who
have
discovered
the
true
gondy
dressed
himself
as
an
officer
put
on
a
felt
cap
with
a
red
feather
hung
on
a
long
sword
buckled
spurs
to
his
boots
wrapped
himself
in
an
ample
cloak
and
followed
the
curate
the
coadjutor
and
his
companion
passed
through
all
the
streets
lying
between
the
archbishopric
and
the
eustache
church
watching
carefully
to
ascertain
the
popular
feeling
the
people
were
in
an
excited
mood
but
like
a
swarm
of
frightened
bees
seemed
not
to
know
at
what
point
to
concentrate
and
it
was
very
evident
that
if
leaders
of
the
people
were
not
provided
all
this
agitation
would
pass
off
in
idle
buzzing
on
arriving
at
the
rue
des
prouvaires
the
curate
pointed
toward
the
square
before
the
church
stop
he
said
there
he
is
at
his
gondy
looked
at
the
spot
indicated
and
perceived
a
beggar
seated
in
a
chair
and
leaning
against
one
of
the
moldings
a
little
basin
was
near
him
and
he
held
a
holy
water
brush
in
his
hand
is
it
by
permission
that
he
remains
there
asked
gondy
no
my
lord
these
places
are
bought
i
believe
this
man
paid
his
predecessor
a
hundred
pistoles
for
the
rascal
is
rich
then
some
of
those
men
sometimes
die
worth
twenty
thousand
and
and
thirty
thousand
francs
and
sometimes
hum
said
gondy
laughing
i
was
not
aware
my
alms
were
so
well
in
the
meantime
they
were
advancing
toward
the
square
and
the
moment
the
coadjutor
and
the
curate
put
their
feet
on
the
first
church
step
the
mendicant
arose
and
proffered
his
brush
he
was
a
man
between
and
years
of
age
little
rather
stout
with
gray
hair
and
light
eyes
his
countenance
denoted
the
struggle
between
two
opposite
principles
a
wicked
nature
subdued
by
determination
perhaps
by
repentance
he
started
on
seeing
the
cavalier
with
the
curate
the
latter
and
the
coadjutor
touched
the
brush
with
the
tips
of
their
fingers
and
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
the
coadjutor
threw
a
piece
of
money
into
the
hat
which
was
on
the
ground
maillard
began
the
curate
this
gentleman
and
i
have
come
to
talk
with
you
a
with
me
said
the
mendicant
it
is
a
great
honor
for
a
poor
distributor
of
holy
there
was
an
ironical
tone
in
his
voice
which
he
could
not
quite
disguise
and
which
astonished
the
coadjutor
yes
continued
the
curate
apparently
accustomed
to
this
tone
yes
we
wish
to
know
your
opinion
of
the
events
of
and
what
you
have
heard
said
by
people
going
in
and
out
of
the
the
mendicant
shook
his
head
these
are
melancholy
doings
your
reverence
which
always
fall
again
upon
the
poor
as
to
what
is
said
everybody
is
discontented
everybody
complains
but
everybody
means
explain
yourself
my
good
friend
said
the
coadjutor
i
mean
that
all
these
cries
all
these
complaints
these
curses
produce
nothing
but
storms
and
flashes
and
that
is
all
but
the
lightning
will
not
strike
until
there
is
a
hand
to
guide
my
friend
said
gondy
you
seem
to
be
a
clever
and
a
thoughtful
man
are
you
disposed
to
take
a
part
in
a
little
civil
war
should
we
have
one
and
put
at
the
command
of
the
leader
should
we
find
one
your
personal
influence
and
the
influence
you
have
acquired
over
your
comrades
yes
sir
provided
this
war
were
approved
of
by
the
church
and
would
advance
the
end
i
wish
to
attain
i
mean
the
remission
of
my
the
war
will
not
only
be
approved
of
but
directed
by
the
church
as
for
the
remission
of
your
sins
we
have
the
archbishop
of
paris
who
has
the
very
greatest
power
at
the
court
of
rome
and
even
the
coadjutor
who
possesses
some
plenary
indulgences
we
will
recommend
you
to
consider
maillard
said
the
curate
that
i
have
recommended
you
to
this
gentleman
who
is
a
powerful
lord
and
that
i
have
made
myself
responsible
for
i
know
monsieur
le
cure
said
the
beggar
that
you
have
always
been
very
kind
to
me
and
therefore
i
in
my
turn
will
be
serviceable
to
and
do
you
think
your
power
as
great
with
the
fraternity
as
monsieur
le
cure
told
me
it
was
just
now
i
think
they
have
some
esteem
for
me
said
the
mendicant
with
pride
and
that
not
only
will
they
obey
me
but
wherever
i
go
they
will
follow
and
could
you
count
on
fifty
resolute
men
good
unemployed
but
active
souls
brawlers
capable
of
bringing
down
the
walls
of
the
palais
royal
by
crying
down
with
mazarin
as
fell
those
at
jericho
i
think
said
the
beggar
i
can
undertake
things
more
difficult
and
more
important
than
ah
ah
said
gondy
you
will
undertake
then
some
night
to
throw
up
some
ten
barricades
i
will
undertake
to
throw
up
fifty
and
when
the
day
comes
to
defend
i
faith
exclaimed
gondy
you
speak
with
a
certainty
that
gives
me
pleasure
and
since
monsieur
le
cure
can
answer
for
you
i
answer
for
him
said
the
curate
here
is
a
bag
containing
five
hundred
pistoles
in
gold
make
all
your
arrangements
and
tell
me
where
i
shall
be
able
to
find
you
this
evening
at
ten
o
it
must
be
on
some
elevated
place
whence
a
given
signal
may
be
seen
in
every
part
of
shall
i
give
you
a
line
for
the
vicar
of
jacques
de
la
boucherie
he
will
let
you
into
the
rooms
in
his
tower
said
the
curate
capital
answered
the
mendicant
then
said
the
coadjutor
this
evening
at
ten
o
clock
and
if
i
am
pleased
with
you
another
bag
of
five
hundred
pistoles
will
be
at
your
the
eyes
of
the
mendicant
dashed
with
cupidity
but
he
quickly
suppressed
his
emotion
this
evening
sir
he
replied
all
will
be
the
tower
of
jacques
de
la
boucherie
at
a
quarter
to
six
o
clock
monsieur
de
gondy
having
finished
his
business
returned
to
the
archiepiscopal
palace
at
six
o
clock
the
curate
of
merri
was
announced
the
coadjutor
glanced
rapidly
behind
and
saw
that
he
was
followed
by
another
man
the
curate
then
entered
followed
by
planchet
your
holiness
said
the
curate
here
is
the
person
of
whom
i
had
the
honor
to
speak
to
planchet
saluted
in
the
manner
of
one
accustomed
to
fine
houses
and
you
are
disposed
to
serve
the
cause
of
the
people
asked
gondy
most
undoubtedly
said
planchet
i
am
a
frondist
from
my
heart
you
see
in
me
such
as
i
am
a
person
sentenced
to
be
and
on
what
account
i
rescued
from
the
hands
of
mazarin
s
police
a
noble
lord
whom
they
were
conducting
back
to
the
bastile
where
he
had
been
for
five
will
you
name
him
oh
you
know
him
well
my
lord
it
is
count
de
ah
really
yes
said
the
coadjutor
i
have
heard
this
affair
mentioned
you
raised
the
whole
district
so
they
told
me
very
nearly
replied
planchet
with
a
air
and
your
business
is
that
of
a
confectioner
in
the
rue
des
explain
to
me
how
it
happens
that
following
so
peaceful
a
business
you
had
such
warlike
why
does
my
lord
belonging
to
the
church
now
receive
me
in
the
dress
of
an
officer
with
a
sword
at
his
side
and
spurs
to
his
boots
not
badly
answered
i
faith
said
gondy
laughing
but
i
have
you
must
know
always
had
in
spite
of
my
bands
warlike
well
my
lord
before
i
became
a
confectioner
i
myself
was
three
years
sergeant
in
the
piedmontese
regiment
and
before
i
became
sergeant
i
was
for
eighteen
months
the
servant
of
monsieur
d
the
lieutenant
of
musketeers
asked
gondy
himself
my
but
he
is
said
to
be
a
furious
phew
whistled
planchet
what
do
you
mean
by
that
nothing
my
lord
monsieur
d
artagnan
belongs
to
the
service
monsieur
d
artagnan
makes
it
his
business
to
defend
the
cardinal
who
pays
him
as
much
as
we
make
it
ours
we
citizens
to
attack
him
whom
he
you
are
an
intelligent
fellow
my
friend
can
we
count
upon
you
you
may
count
upon
me
my
lord
provided
you
want
to
make
a
complete
upheaval
of
the
tis
that
exactly
how
many
men
think
you
you
could
collect
together
two
hundred
muskets
and
five
hundred
let
there
be
only
one
man
in
every
district
who
can
do
as
much
and
by
we
shall
have
quite
a
powerful
army
are
you
disposed
to
obey
count
de
rochefort
i
would
follow
him
to
hell
and
that
is
saying
not
a
little
as
i
believe
him
entirely
capable
of
the
bravo
by
what
sign
shall
we
be
able
to
distinguish
friends
from
foes
every
frondist
must
put
a
knot
of
straw
in
his
good
give
the
do
you
want
money
money
never
comes
amiss
at
any
time
my
lord
if
one
has
it
not
one
must
do
without
it
with
it
matters
go
on
much
better
and
more
gondy
went
to
a
box
and
drew
forth
a
bag
here
are
five
hundred
pistoles
he
said
and
if
the
action
goes
off
well
you
may
reckon
upon
a
similar
sum
i
will
give
a
faithful
account
of
the
sum
to
your
lordship
said
planchet
putting
the
bag
under
his
arm
that
is
right
i
recommend
the
cardinal
to
your
make
your
mind
easy
he
is
in
good
planchet
went
out
the
curate
remaining
for
a
moment
are
you
satisfied
my
lord
he
asked
yes
he
appears
to
be
a
resolute
well
he
will
do
more
than
he
has
he
will
do
wonders
the
curate
rejoined
planchet
who
was
waiting
for
him
on
the
stairs
ten
minutes
later
the
curate
of
sulpice
was
announced
as
soon
as
the
door
of
gondy
s
study
was
opened
a
man
rushed
in
it
was
the
count
de
rochefort
tis
you
then
my
dear
count
cried
gondy
offering
his
hand
you
have
made
up
your
mind
at
last
my
lord
said
rochefort
it
has
been
made
up
a
long
time
said
gondy
let
us
say
no
more
on
the
subject
you
tell
me
so
i
believe
you
well
we
are
going
to
give
a
ball
to
i
hope
and
when
will
the
dance
begin
the
invitations
are
given
for
this
evening
said
the
coadjutor
but
the
violins
will
not
begin
to
play
until
you
may
reckon
upon
me
and
upon
fifty
soldiers
which
the
chevalier
d
humieres
has
promised
me
whenever
i
need
upon
fifty
soldiers
yes
he
is
making
recruits
and
he
will
lend
them
to
me
if
any
are
missing
when
the
fete
is
over
i
shall
replace
good
my
dear
rochefort
but
that
is
not
all
what
have
you
done
with
monsieur
de
beaufort
he
is
in
vendome
where
he
will
wait
until
i
write
to
him
to
return
to
write
to
him
now
s
the
you
are
sure
of
your
enterprise
yes
but
he
must
make
haste
for
hardly
will
the
people
of
paris
have
revolted
before
we
shall
have
a
score
of
princes
begging
to
lead
them
if
he
defers
he
will
find
the
place
of
honor
shall
i

my
cardinal

hat

much
since

hat

a
form

me
said
gondy
i
wish
at
least
that

hat

be
one

not
dispute
matters
of
taste
and
colors

rochefort
laughing

five
let
him
come
and
he
will
find
a
change

therefore

and

your
fifty
men
and
hold
yourself
in
for
what
for

any
signal
for
the
general
rally
a
knot
of
straw
in
the
very
good
adieu
my
adieu
my
dear
ah
monsieur
mazarin
monsieur
mazarin
said
rochefort
leading
off
his
curate
who
had
not
found
an
opportunity
of
uttering
a
single
word
during
the
foregoing
dialogue
you
will
see
whether
i
am
too
old
to
be
a
man
of
it
was
nine
o
clock
and
the
coadjutor
required
half
an
hour
to
go
from
the
archbishop
s
palace
to
the
tower
of
jacques
de
la
boucherie
he
remarked
that
a
light
was
burning
in
one
of
the
highest
windows
of
the
tower
good
said
he
our
syndic
is
at
his
he
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
the
vicar
himself
awaited
him
conducted
him
to
the
top
of
the
tower
and
when
there
pointed
to
a
little
door
placed
the
light
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
a
corner
of
the
wall
that
the
coadjutor
might
be
able
to
find
it
on
his
return
and
went
down
again
although
the
key
was
in
the
door
the
coadjutor
knocked
come
in
said
a
voice
which
he
recognized
as
that
of
the
mendicant
whom
he
found
lying
on
a
kind
of
truckle
bed
he
rose
on
the
entrance
of
the
coadjutor
and
at
that
moment
ten
o
clock
struck
well
said
gondy
have
you
kept
your
word
with
me
not
exactly
replied
the
mendicant
how
is
that
you
asked
me
for
five
hundred
men
did
you
not
well
i
have
ten
thousand
for
you
are
not
boasting
do
you
wish
for
a
proof
there
were
three
candles
alight
each
of
which
burnt
before
a
window
one
looking
upon
the
city
the
other
upon
the
palais
royal
and
a
third
upon
the
rue
saint
denis
the
man
went
silently
to
each
of
the
candles
and
blew
them
out
one
after
the
other
what
are
you
doing
asked
the
coadjutor
i
have
given
the
for
what
for
the
barricades
when
you
leave
this
you
will
behold
my
men
at
work
only
take
care
you
do
not
break
your
legs
in
stumbling
over
some
chain
or
your
neck
by
falling
in
a
good
there
is
your
money
the
same
sum
as
that
you
have
received
already
now
remember
that
you
are
a
general
and
do
not
go
and
for
twenty
years
i
have
tasted
nothing
but
the
man
took
the
bag
from
the
hands
of
the
coadjutor
who
heard
the
sound
of
his
fingers
counting
and
handling
the
gold
pieces
ah
ah
said
the
coadjutor
you
are
avaricious
my
good
the
mendicant
sighed
and
threw
down
the
bag
must
i
always
be
the
same
said
he
and
shall
i
never
succeed
in
overcoming
the
old
leaven
oh
misery
oh
vanity
you
take
it
yes
but
i
make
hereby
a
vow
in
your
presence
to
employ
all
that
remains
to
me
in
pious
his
face
was
pale
and
drawn
like
that
of
a
man
who
had
just
undergone
some
inward
struggle
singular
man
muttered
gondy
taking
his
hat
to
go
away
but
on
turning
around
he
saw
the
beggar
between
him
and
the
door
his
first
idea
was
that
this
man
intended
to
do
him
some
harm
but
on
the
contrary
he
saw
him
fall
on
his
knees
before
him
with
his
hands
clasped
your
blessing
your
holiness
before
you
go
i
beseech
you
he
cried
your
holiness
said
gondy
my
friend
you
take
me
for
some
one
no
your
holiness
i
take
you
for
what
you
are
that
is
to
say
the
coadjutor
i
recognized
you
at
the
first
gondy
smiled
and
you
want
my
blessing
he
said
yes
i
have
need
of
the
mendicant
uttered
these
words
in
a
tone
of
such
humility
such
earnest
repentance
that
gondy
placed
his
hand
upon
him
and
gave
him
his
benediction
with
all
the
unction
of
which
he
was
capable
now
said
gondy
there
is
a
communion
between
us
i
have
blessed
you
and
you
are
sacred
to
me
come
have
you
committed
some
crime
pursued
by
human
justice
from
which
i
can
protect
you
the
beggar
shook
his
head
the
crime
which
i
have
committed
my
lord
has
no
call
upon
human
justice
and
you
can
only
deliver
me
from
it
by
blessing
me
frequently
as
you
have
just
come
be
candid
said
the
coadjutor
you
have
not
all
your
life
followed
the
trade
which
you
do
now
no
my
lord
i
have
pursued
it
for
six
years
and
previously
where
were
you
in
the
and
before
you
went
to
the
bastile
i
will
tell
you
my
lord
on
the
day
when
you
are
willing
to
hear
my
good
at
whatsoever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
you
may
present
yourself
remember
that
i
shall
be
ready
to
give
you
thank
you
my
lord
said
the
mendicant
in
a
hoarse
voice
but
i
am
not
yet
ready
to
receive
very
well
adieu
your
holiness
said
the
mendicant
opening
the
door
and
bending
low
before
the
prelate
the
riot
it
was
about
eleven
o
clock
at
night
gondy
had
not
walked
a
hundred
steps
ere
he
perceived
the
strange
change
which
had
been
made
in
the
streets
of
paris
the
whole
city
seemed
peopled
with
fantastic
beings
silent
shadows
were
seen
unpaving
the
streets
and
others
dragging
and
upsetting
great
wagons
whilst
others
again
dug
ditches
large
enough
to
ingulf
whole
regiments
of
horsemen
these
active
beings
flitted
here
and
there
like
so
many
demons
completing
some
unknown
labor
these
were
the
beggars
of
the
court
of
miracles
the
agents
of
the
giver
of
holy
water
in
the
square
of
saint
eustache
preparing
barricades
for
the
morrow
gondy
gazed
on
these
deeds
of
darkness
on
these
nocturnal
laborers
with
a
kind
of
fear
he
asked
himself
if
after
having
called
forth
these
foul
creatures
from
their
dens
he
should
have
the
power
of
making
them
retire
again
he
felt
almost
inclined
to
cross
himself
when
one
of
these
beings
happened
to
approach
him
he
reached
the
rue
saint
honore
and
went
up
it
toward
the
rue
de
la
ferronnerie
there
the
aspect
changed
here
it
was
the
tradesmen
who
were
running
from
shop
to
shop
their
doors
seemed
closed
like
their
shutters
but
they
were
only
pushed
to
in
such
a
manner
as
to
open
and
allow
the
men
who
seemed
fearful
of
showing
what
they
carried
to
enter
closing
immediately
these
men
were
shopkeepers
who
had
arms
to
lend
to
those
who
had
none
one
individual
went
from
door
to
door
bending
under
the
weight
of
swords
guns
muskets
and
every
kind
of
weapon
which
he
deposited
as
fast
as
he
could
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
the
coadjutor
recognized
planchet
the
coadjutor
proceeded
onward
to
the
quay
by
way
of
the
rue
de
la
monnaie
there
he
found
groups
of
bourgeois
clad
in
black
cloaks
or
gray
according
as
they
belonged
to
the
upper
or
lower
bourgeoisie
they
were
standing
motionless
while
single
men
passed
from
one
group
to
another
all
these
cloaks
gray
or
black
were
raised
behind
by
the
point
of
a
sword
or
before
by
the
barrel
of
an
arquebuse
or
a
musket
on
reaching
the
pont
neuf
the
coadjutor
found
it
strictly
guarded
and
a
man
approached
him
who
are
you
asked
the
man
i
do
not
know
you
for
one
of
then
it
is
because
you
do
not
know
your
friends
my
dear
monsieur
louvieres
said
the
coadjutor
raising
his
hat
louvieres
recognized
him
and
bowed
gondy
continued
his
way
and
went
as
far
as
the
tour
de
nesle
there
he
saw
a
lengthy
chain
of
people
gliding
under
the
walls
they
might
be
said
to
be
a
procession
of
ghosts
for
they
were
all
wrapped
in
white
cloaks
when
they
reached
a
certain
spot
these
men
appeared
to
be
annihilated
one
after
the
other
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
under
their
feet
gondy
edged
into
a
corner
saw
them
vanish
from
the
first
until
the
last
but
one
the
last
raised
his
eyes
to
ascertain
doubtless
that
neither
his
companions
nor
himself
had
been
watched
and
in
spite
of
the
darkness
he
perceived
gondy
he
walked
straight
up
to
him
and
placed
a
pistol
to
his
throat
halloo
monsieur
de
rochefort
said
gondy
laughing
are
you
a
boy
to
play
with
firearms
rochefort
recognized
the
voice
ah
it
is
you
my
lord
said
he
the
very
same
what
people
are
you
leading
thus
into
the
bowels
of
the
earth
my
fifty
recruits
from
the
chevalier
d
humieres
who
are
destined
to
enter
the
light
cavalry
and
who
have
only
received
as
yet
for
their
equipment
their
white
and
where
are
you
going
to
the
house
of
one
of
my
friends
a
sculptor
only
we
enter
by
the
trap
through
which
he
lets
down
his
very
good
said
gondy
shaking
rochefort
by
the
hand
who
descended
in
his
turn
and
closed
the
trap
after
him
it
was
now
one
o
clock
in
the
morning
and
the
coadjutor
returned
home
he
opened
a
window
and
leaned
out
to
listen
a
strange
incomprehensible
unearthly
sound
seemed
to
pervade
the
whole
city
one
felt
that
something
unusual
and
terrible
was
happening
in
all
the
streets
now
dark
as
ocean
s
most
unfathomable
caves
from
time
to
time
a
dull
sound
was
heard
like
that
of
a
rising
tempest
or
a
billow
of
the
sea
but
nothing
clear
nothing
distinct
nothing
intelligible
it
was
like
those
mysterious
subterraneous
noises
that
precede
an
earthquake
the
work
of
revolt
continued
the
whole
night
thus
the
next
morning
on
awaking
paris
seemed
to
be
startled
at
her
own
appearance
it
was
like
a
besieged
town
armed
men
shouldering
muskets
watched
over
the
barricades
with
menacing
looks
words
of
command
patrols
arrests
executions
even
were
encountered
at
every
step
those
bearing
plumed
hats
and
gold
swords
were
stopped
and
made
to
cry
long
live
broussel
down
with
mazarin
and
whoever
refused
to
comply
with
this
ceremony
was
hooted
at
spat
upon
and
even
beaten
they
had
not
yet
begun
to
slay
but
it
was
well
felt
that
the
inclination
to
do
so
was
not
wanting
the
barricades
had
been
pushed
as
far
as
the
palais
royal
from
the
rue
de
bons
enfants
to
that
of
the
ferronnerie
from
the
rue
saint
to
the
pont
neuf
from
the
rue
richelieu
to
the
porte
saint
honore
there
were
more
than
ten
thousand
armed
men
those
who
were
at
the
front
hurled
defiance
at
the
impassive
sentinels
of
the
regiment
of
guards
posted
around
the
palais
royal
the
gates
of
which
were
closed
behind
them
a
precaution
which
made
their
situation
precarious
among
these
thousands
moved
in
bands
numbering
from
one
hundred
to
two
hundred
pale
and
haggard
men
clothed
in
rags
who
bore
a
sort
of
standard
on
which
was
inscribed
these
words
behold
the
misery
of
the
people
wherever
these
men
passed
frenzied
cries
were
heard
and
there
were
so
many
of
these
bands
that
the
cries
were
to
be
heard
in
all
directions
the
astonishment
of
mazarin
and
of
anne
of
austria
was
great
when
it
was
announced
to
them
that
the
city
which
the
previous
evening
they
had
left
entirely
tranquil
had
awakened
to
such
feverish
commotion
nor
would
either
the
one
or
the
other
believe
the
reports
that
were
brought
to
them
declaring
they
would
rather
rely
on
the
evidence
of
their
own
eyes
and
ears
then
a
window
was
opened
and
when
they
saw
and
heard
they
were
convinced
mazarin
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
pretended
to
despise
the
populace
but
he
turned
visibly
pale
and
ran
to
his
closet
trembling
all
over
locked
up
his
gold
and
jewels
in
his
caskets
and
put
his
finest
diamonds
on
his
fingers
as
for
the
queen
furious
and
left
to
her
own
guidance
she
went
for
the
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
and
desired
him
to
take
as
many
men
as
he
pleased
and
to
go
and
see
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
pleasantry
the
marshal
was
ordinarily
very
adventurous
and
was
wont
to
hesitate
at
nothing
and
he
had
that
lofty
contempt
for
the
populace
which
army
officers
usually
profess
he
took
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
attempted
to
go
out
by
the
pont
du
louvre
but
there
he
met
rochefort
and
his
fifty
horsemen
attended
by
more
than
five
hundred
men
the
marshal
made
no
attempt
to
force
that
barrier
and
returned
up
the
quay
but
at
pont
neuf
he
found
louvieres
and
his
bourgeois
this
time
the
marshal
charged
but
he
was
welcomed
by
musket
shots
while
stones
fell
like
hail
from
all
the
windows
he
left
there
three
men
he
beat
a
retreat
toward
the
market
but
there
he
met
planchet
with
his
halberdiers
their
halberds
were
leveled
at
him
threateningly
he
attempted
to
ride
over
those
gray
cloaks
but
the
gray
cloaks
held
their
ground
and
the
marshal
retired
toward
the
rue
saint
honore
leaving
four
of
his
guards
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
the
marshal
then
entered
the
rue
saint
honore
but
there
he
was
opposed
by
the
barricades
of
the
mendicant
of
saint
eustache
they
were
guarded
not
only
by
armed
men
but
even
by
women
and
children
master
friquet
the
owner
of
a
pistol
and
of
a
sword
which
louvieres
had
given
him
had
organized
a
company
of
rogues
like
himself
and
was
making
a
tremendous
racket
the
marshal
thought
this
barrier
not
so
well
fortified
as
the
others
and
determined
to
break
through
it
he
dismounted
twenty
men
to
make
a
breach
in
the
barricade
whilst
he
and
others
remaining
on
their
horses
were
to
protect
the
assailants
the
twenty
men
marched
straight
toward
the
barrier
but
from
behind
the
beams
from
among
the
and
from
the
heights
of
the
rocks
a
terrible
fusillade
burst
forth
and
at
the
same
time
planchet
s
halberdiers
appeared
at
the
corner
of
the
cemetery
of
the
innocents
and
louvieres
s
bourgeois
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
monnaie
the
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
was
caught
between
two
fires
but
he
was
brave
and
made
up
his
mind
to
die
where
he
was
he
returned
blow
for
blow
and
cries
of
pain
began
to
be
heard
in
the
crowd
the
guards
more
skillful
did
greater
execution
but
the
bourgeois
more
numerous
overwhelmed
them
with
a
veritable
hurricane
of
iron
men
fell
around
him
as
they
had
fallen
at
rocroy
or
at
lerida
fontrailles
his
had
an
arm
broken
his
horse
had
received
a
bullet
in
his
neck
and
he
had
difficulty
in
controlling
him
maddened
by
pain
in
short
he
had
reached
that
supreme
moment
when
the
bravest
feel
a
shudder
in
their
veins
when
suddenly
in
the
direction
of
the
rue
de
l
the
crowd
opened
crying
long
live
the
coadjutor
and
gondy
in
surplice
and
cloak
appeared
moving
tranquilly
in
the
midst
of
the
fusillade
and
bestowing
his
benedictions
to
the
right
and
left
as
undisturbed
as
if
he
were
leading
a
procession
of
the
fete
dieu
all
fell
to
their
knees
the
marshal
recognized
him
and
hastened
to
meet
him
get
me
out
of
this
in
heaven
s
name
he
said
or
i
shall
leave
my
carcass
here
and
those
of
all
my
a
great
tumult
arose
in
the
midst
of
which
even
the
noise
of
thunder
could
not
have
been
heard
gondy
raised
his
hand
and
demanded
silence
all
were
still
my
children
he
said
this
is
the
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
as
to
whose
intentions
you
have
been
deceived
and
who
pledges
himself
on
returning
to
the
louvre
to
demand
of
the
queen
in
your
name
our
broussel
s
release
you
pledge
yourself
to
that
marshal
added
gondy
turning
to
la
meilleraie
morbleu
cried
the
latter
i
should
say
that
i
do
pledge
myself
to
it
i
had
no
hope
of
getting
off
so
he
gives
you
his
word
of
honor
said
gondy
the
marshal
raised
his
hand
in
token
of
assent
long
live
the
coadjutor
cried
the
crowd
some
voices
even
added
long
live
the
marshal
but
all
took
up
the
cry
in
chorus
down
with
mazarin
the
crowd
gave
place
the
barricade
was
opened
and
the
marshal
with
the
remnant
of
his
company
retreated
preceded
by
friquet
and
his
bandits
some
of
them
making
a
presence
of
beating
drums
and
others
imitating
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
it
was
almost
a
triumphal
procession
only
behind
the
guards
the
barricades
were
closed
again
the
marshal
bit
his
fingers
in
the
meantime
as
we
have
said
mazarin
was
in
his
closet
putting
his
affairs
in
order
he
called
for
d
artagnan
but
in
the
midst
of
such
tumult
he
little
expected
to
see
him
d
artagnan
not
being
on
service
in
about
ten
minutes
d
artagnan
appeared
at
the
door
followed
by
the
inseparable
porthos
ah
come
in
come
in
monsieur
d
artagnan
cried
the
cardinal
and
welcome
your
friend
too
but
what
is
going
on
in
this
accursed
paris
what
is
going
on
my
lord
nothing
good
replied
d
artagnan
shaking
his
head
the
town
is
in
open
revolt
and
just
now
as
i
was
crossing
the
rue
montorgueil
with
monsieur
du
vallon
who
is
here
and
is
your
humble
servant
they
wanted
in
spite
of
my
uniform
or
perhaps
because
of
my
uniform
to
make
us
cry
long
live
broussel
and
must
i
tell
you
my
lord
what
they
wished
us
to
cry
as
well
speak
down
with
mazarin
i
faith
the
treasonable
word
is
mazarin
smiled
but
became
very
pale
and
you
did
cry
he
asked
i
faith
no
said
d
artagnan
i
was
not
in
voice
monsieur
du
vallon
has
a
cold
and
did
not
cry
either
then
my
lord
then
what
asked
mazarin
look
at
my
hat
and
and
d
artagnan
displayed
four
gunshot
holes
in
his
cloak
and
two
in
his
beaver
as
for
porthos
s
coat
a
blow
from
a
halberd
had
cut
it
open
on
the
flank
and
a
pistol
shot
had
cut
his
feather
in
two
diavolo
said
the
cardinal
pensively
gazing
at
the
two
friends
with
lively
admiration
i
should
have
cried
i
at
this
moment
the
tumult
was
heard
nearer
mazarin
wiped
his
forehead
and
looked
around
him
he
had
a
great
desire
to
go
to
the
window
but
he
dared
not
see
what
is
going
on
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
he
d
artagnan
went
to
the
window
with
his
habitual
composure
oho
said
he
what
is
this
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
returning
without
a
hat
fontrailles
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
wounded
guards
horses
bleeding
eh
then
what
are
the
sentinels
about
they
are
aiming
they
are
going
to
fire
they
have
received
orders
to
fire
on
the
people
if
the
people
approach
the
palais
royal
exclaimed
mazarin
but
if
they
fire
all
is
lost
cried
d
artagnan
we
have
the
the
gates
to
hold
for
five
minutes
the
gates
they
will
be
torn
down
twisted
into
iron
wire
ground
to
powder
god
s
death
don
t
fire
screamed
d
artagnan
throwing
open
the
window
in
spite
of
this
recommendation
which
owing
to
the
noise
could
scarcely
have
been
heard
two
or
three
musket
shots
resounded
succeeded
by
a
terrible
discharge
the
balls
might
be
heard
peppering
the
facade
of
the
palais
royal
and
one
of
them
passing
under
d
artagnan
s
arm
entered
and
broke
a
mirror
in
which
porthos
was
complacently
admiring
himself
alack
alack
cried
the
cardinal
a
venetian
glass
oh
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
quietly
shutting
the
window
it
is
not
worth
while
weeping
yet
for
probably
an
hour
hence
there
will
not
be
one
of
your
mirrors
remaining
in
the
palais
royal
whether
they
be
venetian
or
but
what
do
you
advise
then
asked
mazarin
trembling
eh
egad
to
give
up
broussel
as
they
demand
what
the
devil
do
you
want
with
a
member
of
the
parliament
he
is
of
no
earthly
use
to
and
you
monsieur
du
vallon
is
that
your
advice
what
would
you
do
i
should
give
up
broussel
said
porthos
come
come
with
me
gentlemen
exclaimed
mazarin
i
will
go
and
discuss
the
matter
with
the
he
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
and
said
i
can
count
upon
you
gentlemen
can
i
not
we
do
not
give
ourselves
twice
over
said
d
artagnan
we
have
given
ourselves
to
you
command
we
shall
very
well
then
said
mazarin
enter
this
cabinet
and
wait
till
i
come
and
turning
off
he
entered
the
by
another
door
the
riot
becomes
a
revolution
the
closet
into
which
d
artagnan
and
porthos
had
been
ushered
was
separated
from
the
where
the
queen
was
by
tapestried
curtains
only
and
this
thin
partition
enabled
them
to
hear
all
that
passed
in
the
adjoining
room
whilst
the
aperture
between
the
two
hangings
small
as
it
was
permitted
them
to
see
the
queen
was
standing
in
the
room
pale
with
anger
her
however
was
so
great
that
it
might
have
been
imagined
that
she
was
calm
comminges
villequier
and
guitant
were
behind
her
and
the
women
again
were
behind
the
men
the
chancellor
sequier
who
twenty
years
previously
had
persecuted
her
so
ruthlessly
stood
before
her
relating
how
his
carriage
had
been
smashed
how
he
had
been
pursued
and
had
rushed
into
the
hotel
d
o
that
the
hotel
was
immediately
invaded
pillaged
and
devastated
happily
he
had
time
to
reach
a
closet
hidden
behind
tapestry
in
which
he
was
secreted
by
an
old
woman
together
with
his
brother
the
bishop
of
meaux
then
the
danger
was
so
imminent
the
rioters
came
so
near
uttering
such
threats
that
the
chancellor
thought
his
last
hour
had
come
and
confessed
himself
to
his
brother
priest
so
as
to
be
all
ready
to
die
in
case
he
was
discovered
fortunately
however
he
had
not
been
taken
the
people
believing
that
he
had
escaped
by
some
back
entrance
retired
and
left
him
at
liberty
to
retreat
then
disguised
in
the
clothes
of
the
marquis
d
o
he
had
left
the
hotel
stumbling
over
the
bodies
of
an
officer
and
two
guards
who
had
been
killed
whilst
defending
the
street
door
during
the
recital
mazarin
entered
and
glided
noiselessly
up
to
the
queen
to
listen
well
said
the
queen
when
the
chancellor
had
finished
speaking
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
i
think
that
matters
look
very
gloomy
but
what
step
would
you
propose
to
me
i
could
propose
one
to
your
majesty
but
i
dare
you
may
you
may
sir
said
the
queen
with
a
bitter
smile
you
were
not
so
timid
the
chancellor
reddened
and
stammered
some
words
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
past
but
of
the
present
said
the
queen
you
said
you
could
give
me
advice
what
is
it
madame
said
the
chancellor
hesitating
it
would
be
to
release
the
queen
although
already
pale
became
visibly
paler
and
her
face
was
contracted
release
broussel
she
cried
never
at
this
moment
steps
were
heard
in
the
and
without
any
announcement
the
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
appeared
at
the
door
ah
there
you
are
marechal
cried
anne
of
austria
joyfully
i
trust
you
have
brought
this
rabble
to
madame
replied
the
marechal
i
have
left
three
men
on
the
pont
neuf
four
at
the
halle
six
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
l
and
two
at
the
door
of
your
palace
fifteen
in
all
i
have
brought
away
ten
or
twelve
wounded
i
know
not
where
i
have
left
my
hat
and
in
all
probability
i
should
have
been
left
with
my
hat
had
the
coadjutor
not
arrived
in
time
to
rescue
ah
indeed
said
the
queen
it
would
have
much
astonished
me
if
that
low
cur
with
his
distorted
legs
had
not
been
mixed
up
with
all
madame
said
la
meilleraie
do
not
say
too
much
against
him
before
me
for
the
service
he
rendered
me
is
still
very
good
said
the
queen
be
as
grateful
as
you
like
it
does
not
implicate
me
you
are
here
safe
and
sound
that
is
all
i
wished
for
you
are
not
only
welcome
but
welcome
yes
madame
but
i
only
came
back
on
one
condition
that
i
would
transmit
to
your
majesty
the
will
of
the
the
will
exclaimed
the
queen
frowning
oh
oh
monsieur
marechal
you
must
indeed
have
found
yourself
in
wondrous
peril
to
have
undertaken
so
strange
a
commission
the
irony
with
which
these
words
were
uttered
did
not
escape
the
marechal
pardon
madame
he
said
i
am
not
a
lawyer
i
am
a
mere
soldier
and
probably
therefore
i
do
not
quite
comprehend
the
value
of
certain
words
i
ought
to
have
said
the
wishes
and
not
the
will
of
the
people
as
for
what
you
do
me
the
honor
to
say
i
presume
you
mean
i
was
afraid
the
queen
smiled
well
then
madame
yes
i
did
feel
fear
and
though
i
have
been
through
twelve
pitched
battles
and
i
can
not
count
how
many
charges
and
skirmishes
i
own
for
the
third
time
in
my
life
i
was
afraid
yes
and
i
would
rather
face
your
majesty
however
threatening
your
smile
than
face
those
demons
who
accompanied
me
hither
and
who
sprung
from
i
know
not
whence
unless
from
deepest
bravo
said
d
artagnan
in
a
whisper
to
porthos
well
well
said
the
queen
biting
her
lips
whilst
her
courtiers
looked
at
each
other
with
surprise
what
is
the
desire
of
my
people
that
broussel
shall
be
given
up
to
them
never
said
the
queen
never
your
majesty
is
mistress
said
la
meilleraie
retreating
a
few
steps
where
are
you
going
marechal
asked
the
queen
to
give
your
majesty
s
reply
to
those
who
await
stay
marechal
i
will
not
appear
to
parley
with
madame
i
have
pledged
my
word
and
unless
you
order
me
to
be
arrested
i
shall
be
forced
to
anne
of
austria
s
eyes
shot
glances
of
fire
oh
that
is
no
impediment
sir
said
she
i
have
had
greater
men
than
you
arrested
guitant
mazarin
sprang
forward
madame
said
he
if
i
dared
in
my
turn
advise
would
it
be
to
give
up
broussel
sir
if
so
you
can
spare
yourself
the
no
said
mazarin
although
perhaps
that
counsel
is
as
good
as
any
then
what
may
it
be
to
call
for
monsieur
le
the
coadjutor
cried
the
queen
that
dreadful
mischief
maker
it
is
he
who
has
raised
all
this
the
more
reason
said
mazarin
if
he
has
raised
it
he
can
put
it
and
hold
madame
suggested
comminges
who
was
near
a
window
out
of
which
he
could
see
hold
the
moment
is
a
happy
one
for
there
he
is
now
giving
his
blessing
in
the
square
of
the
palais
the
queen
sprang
to
the
window
it
is
true
she
said
the
arch
hypocrite
see
i
see
said
mazarin
that
everybody
kneels
before
him
although
he
be
but
coadjutor
whilst
i
were
i
in
his
place
though
i
am
cardinal
should
be
torn
to
pieces
i
persist
then
madame
in
my
wish
he
laid
an
emphasis
on
the
word
that
your
majesty
should
receive
the
and
wherefore
do
you
not
say
like
the
rest
your
will
replied
the
queen
in
a
low
voice
mazarin
bowed
monsieur
le
marechal
said
the
queen
after
a
moment
s
reflection
go
and
find
the
coadjutor
and
bring
him
to
and
what
shall
i
say
to
the
people
that
they
must
have
patience
said
anne
as
i
the
fiery
spanish
woman
spoke
in
a
tone
so
imperative
that
the
marechal
made
no
reply
he
bowed
and
went
out
d
artagnan
turned
to
porthos
how
will
this
end
he
said
we
shall
soon
see
said
porthos
in
his
tranquil
way
in
the
meantime
anne
of
austria
approached
comminges
and
conversed
with
him
in
a
subdued
tone
whilst
mazarin
glanced
uneasily
at
the
corner
occupied
by
d
artagnan
and
porthos
ere
long
the
door
opened
and
the
marechal
entered
followed
by
the
coadjutor
there
madame
he
said
is
monsieur
gondy
who
hastens
to
obey
your
majesty
s
the
queen
advanced
a
few
steps
to
meet
him
and
then
stopped
cold
severe
unmoved
with
her
lower
lip
scornfully
protruded
gondy
bowed
respectfully
well
sir
said
the
queen
what
is
your
opinion
of
this
riot
that
it
is
no
longer
a
riot
madame
he
replied
but
a
the
revolt
is
at
the
door
of
those
who
think
my
people
can
rebel
cried
anne
unable
to
dissimulate
before
the
coadjutor
whom
she
looked
upon
and
probably
with
reason
as
the
promoter
of
the
tumult
revolt
thus
it
is
called
by
those
who
have
wished
for
this
demonstration
and
who
are
perhaps
the
cause
of
it
but
wait
wait
the
king
s
authority
will
put
all
this
to
was
it
to
tell
me
that
madame
coldly
replied
gondy
that
your
majesty
admitted
me
to
the
honor
of
entering
your
presence
no
my
dear
coadjutor
said
mazarin
it
was
to
ask
your
advice
in
the
unhappy
dilemma
in
which
we
find
is
it
true
asked
gondy
feigning
astonishment
that
her
majesty
summoned
me
to
ask
for
my
opinion
yes
said
the
queen
it
is
the
coadjutor
bowed
your
majesty
wishes
then
you
to
say
what
you
would
do
in
her
place
mazarin
hastened
to
reply
the
coadjutor
looked
at
the
queen
who
replied
by
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
were
i
in
her
majesty
s
place
said
gondy
coldly
i
should
not
hesitate
i
should
release
and
if
i
do
not
give
him
up
what
think
you
will
be
the
result
exclaimed
the
queen
i
believe
that
not
a
stone
in
paris
will
remain
unturned
put
in
the
marechal
it
was
not
your
opinion
that
i
asked
said
the
queen
sharply
without
even
turning
around
if
it
is
i
whom
your
majesty
interrogates
replied
the
coadjutor
in
the
same
calm
manner
i
reply
that
i
hold
monsieur
le
marechal
s
opinion
in
every
the
color
mounted
to
the
queen
s
face
her
fine
blue
eyes
seemed
to
start
out
of
her
head
and
her
carmine
lips
compared
by
all
the
poets
of
the
day
to
a
pomegranate
in
flower
were
trembling
with
anger
mazarin
himself
who
was
well
accustomed
to
the
domestic
outbreaks
of
this
disturbed
household
was
alarmed
give
up
broussel
she
cried
fine
counsel
indeed
upon
my
word
one
can
easily
see
it
comes
from
a
gondy
remained
firm
and
the
abuse
of
the
day
seemed
to
glide
over
his
head
as
the
sarcasms
of
the
evening
before
had
done
but
hatred
and
revenge
were
accumulating
in
his
heart
silently
and
drop
by
drop
he
looked
coldly
at
the
queen
who
nudged
mazarin
to
make
him
say
something
in
his
turn
mazarin
according
to
his
custom
was
thinking
much
and
saying
little
ho
ho
said
he
good
advice
advice
of
a
friend
i
too
would
give
up
that
good
monsieur
broussel
dead
or
alive
and
all
would
be
at
an
if
you
yield
him
dead
all
will
indeed
be
at
an
end
my
lord
but
quite
otherwise
than
you
did
i
say
dead
or
alive
replied
mazarin
it
was
only
a
way
of
speaking
you
know
i
am
not
familiar
with
the
french
language
which
you
monsieur
le
coadjuteur
both
speak
and
write
so
this
is
a
council
of
state
d
artagnan
remarked
to
porthos
but
we
held
better
ones
at
la
rochelle
with
athos
and
at
the
saint
gervais
bastion
said
porthos
there
and
the
coadjutor
let
the
storm
pass
over
his
head
and
resumed
still
with
the
same
tranquillity
madame
if
the
opinion
i
have
submitted
to
you
does
not
please
you
it
is
doubtless
because
you
have
better
counsels
to
follow
i
know
too
well
the
wisdom
of
the
queen
and
that
of
her
advisers
to
suppose
that
they
will
leave
the
capital
long
in
trouble
that
may
lead
to
a
thus
then
it
is
your
opinion
said
anne
of
austria
with
a
sneer
and
biting
her
lips
with
rage
that
yesterday
s
riot
which
is
already
a
rebellion
may
become
a
revolution
yes
madame
replied
the
coadjutor
gravely
but
if
i
am
to
believe
you
sir
the
people
seem
to
have
thrown
off
all
it
is
a
bad
year
for
kings
said
gondy
shaking
his
head
look
at
england
yes
but
fortunately
we
have
no
oliver
cromwell
in
france
replied
the
queen
who
knows
said
gondy
such
men
are
like
thunderbolts
one
recognizes
them
only
when
they
have
every
one
shuddered
and
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
during
which
the
queen
pressed
her
hand
to
her
side
evidently
to
still
the
beatings
of
her
heart
porthos
murmured
d
artagnan
look
well
at
that
yes
said
porthos
i
see
him
what
then
well
he
is
a
porthos
looked
at
d
artagnan
in
astonishment
evidently
he
did
not
understand
his
meaning
your
majesty
continued
the
coadjutor
pitilessly
is
about
to
take
such
measures
as
seem
good
to
you
but
i
foresee
that
they
will
be
violent
and
such
as
will
still
further
exasperate
the
in
that
case
you
monsieur
le
coadjuteur
who
have
such
power
over
them
and
are
at
the
same
time
friendly
to
us
said
the
queen
ironically
will
quiet
them
by
bestowing
your
blessing
upon
perhaps
it
will
be
too
late
said
gondy
still
unmoved
perhaps
i
shall
have
lost
all
influence
while
by
giving
up
broussel
your
majesty
will
strike
at
the
root
of
the
sedition
and
will
gain
the
right
to
punish
severely
any
revival
of
the
have
i
not
then
that
right
cried
the
queen
if
you
have
it
use
it
replied
gondy
peste
said
d
artagnan
to
porthos
there
is
a
man
after
my
own
heart
oh
if
he
were
minister
and
i
were
his
d
artagnan
instead
of
belonging
to
that
beast
of
a
mazarin
mordieu
what
fine
things
we
would
do
together
yes
said
porthos
the
queen
made
a
sign
for
every
one
except
mazarin
to
quit
the
room
and
gondy
bowed
as
if
to
leave
with
the
rest
stay
sir
said
anne
to
him
good
thought
gondy
she
is
going
to
she
is
going
to
have
him
killed
said
d
artagnan
to
porthos
but
at
all
events
it
shall
not
be
by
me
i
swear
to
heaven
on
the
contrary
that
if
they
fall
upon
him
i
will
fall
upon
and
i
too
said
porthos
good
muttered
mazarin
sitting
down
we
shall
soon
see
something
the
queen
s
eyes
followed
the
retreating
figures
and
when
the
last
had
closed
the
door
she
turned
away
it
was
evident
that
she
was
making
unnatural
efforts
to
subdue
her
anger
she
fanned
herself
smelled
at
her
vinaigrette
and
walked
up
and
down
gondy
who
began
to
feel
uneasy
examined
the
tapestry
with
his
eyes
touched
the
coat
of
mail
which
he
wore
under
his
long
gown
and
felt
from
time
to
time
to
see
if
the
handle
of
a
good
spanish
dagger
which
was
hidden
under
his
cloak
was
well
within
reach
and
now
at
last
said
the
queen
now
that
we
are
alone
repeat
your
counsel
monsieur
le
it
is
this
madame
that
you
should
appear
to
have
reflected
and
publicly
acknowledge
an
error
which
constitutes
the
extra
strength
of
a
strong
government
release
broussel
from
prison
and
give
him
back
to
the
oh
cried
anne
to
humble
myself
thus
am
i
or
am
i
not
the
queen
this
screaming
mob
are
they
or
are
they
not
my
subjects
have
i
friends
have
i
guards
ah
by
notre
dame
as
queen
catherine
used
to
say
continued
she
excited
by
her
own
words
rather
than
give
up
this
infamous
broussel
to
them
i
will
strangle
him
with
my
own
hands
and
she
sprang
toward
gondy
whom
assuredly
at
that
moment
she
hated
more
than
broussel
with
outstretched
arms
the
coadjutor
remained
immovable
and
not
a
muscle
of
his
face
was
discomposed
only
his
glance
flashed
like
a
sword
in
returning
the
furious
looks
of
the
queen
he
were
a
dead
man
said
the
gascon
if
there
were
still
a
vitry
at
the
court
and
if
vitry
entered
at
this
moment
but
for
my
part
before
he
could
reach
the
good
prelate
i
would
kill
vitry
at
once
the
cardinal
would
be
infinitely
pleased
with
hush
said
porthos
madame
cried
the
cardinal
seizing
hold
of
anne
and
drawing
her
back
madame
what
are
you
about
then
he
added
in
spanish
anne
are
you
mad
you
a
queen
to
quarrel
like
a
washerwoman
and
do
you
not
perceive
that
in
the
person
of
this
priest
is
represented
the
whole
people
of
paris
and
that
it
is
dangerous
to
insult
him
at
this
moment
and
if
this
priest
wished
it
in
an
hour
you
would
be
without
a
crown
come
then
on
another
occasion
you
can
be
firm
and
strong
but
is
not
the
proper
time
flatter
and
caress
or
you
are
only
a
common
at
the
first
words
of
this
address
d
artagnan
had
seized
porthos
s
arm
which
he
pressed
with
gradually
increasing
force
when
mazarin
ceased
speaking
he
said
to
porthos
in
a
low
tone
never
tell
mazarin
that
i
understand
spanish
or
i
am
a
lost
man
and
you
are
all
right
said
porthos
this
rough
appeal
marked
by
the
eloquence
which
characterized
mazarin
when
he
spoke
in
italian
or
spanish
and
which
he
lost
entirely
in
speaking
french
was
uttered
with
such
impenetrable
expression
that
gondy
clever
physiognomist
as
he
was
had
no
suspicion
of
its
being
more
than
a
simple
warning
to
be
more
subdued
the
queen
on
her
part
thus
chided
softened
immediately
and
sat
down
and
in
an
almost
weeping
voice
letting
her
arms
fall
by
her
side
said
pardon
me
sir
and
attribute
this
violence
to
what
i
suffer
a
woman
and
consequently
subject
to
the
weaknesses
of
my
sex
i
am
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
civil
war
a
queen
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
i
am
excited
at
the
first
madame
replied
gondy
bowing
your
majesty
is
mistaken
in
qualifying
my
sincere
advice
as
opposition
your
majesty
has
none
but
submissive
and
respectful
subjects
it
is
not
the
queen
with
whom
the
people
are
displeased
they
ask
for
broussel
and
are
only
too
happy
if
you
release
him
to
them
to
live
under
your
mazarin
who
at
the
words
it
is
not
the
queen
with
whom
the
people
are
displeased
had
pricked
up
his
ears
thinking
that
the
coadjutor
was
about
to
speak
of
the
cries
down
with
mazarin
and
pleased
with
gondy
s
suppression
of
this
fact
he
said
with
his
sweetest
voice
and
his
most
gracious
expression
madame
credit
the
coadjutor
who
is
one
of
the
most
able
politicians
we
have
the
first
available
cardinal
s
hat
seems
to
belong
already
to
his
noble
ah
how
much
you
have
need
of
me
cunning
rogue
thought
gondy
and
what
will
he
promise
us
said
d
artagnan
peste
if
he
is
giving
away
hats
like
that
porthos
let
us
look
out
and
both
demand
a
regiment
corbleu
let
the
civil
war
last
but
one
year
and
i
will
have
a
constable
s
sword
gilt
for
and
for
me
put
in
porthos
for
you
i
will
give
you
the
baton
of
the
marechal
de
la
meilleraie
who
does
not
seem
to
be
much
in
favor
just
and
so
sir
said
the
queen
you
are
seriously
afraid
of
a
public
seriously
said
gondy
astonished
at
not
having
further
advanced
i
fear
that
when
the
torrent
has
broken
its
embankment
it
will
cause
fearful
and
i
said
the
queen
think
that
in
such
a
case
other
embankments
should
be
raised
to
oppose
it
go
i
will
gondy
looked
at
mazarin
astonished
and
mazarin
approached
the
queen
to
speak
to
her
but
at
this
moment
a
frightful
tumult
arose
from
the
square
of
the
palais
royal
gondy
smiled
the
queen
s
color
rose
and
mazarin
grew
even
paler
what
is
that
again
he
asked
at
this
moment
comminges
rushed
into
the
room
pardon
your
majesty
he
cried
but
the
people
have
dashed
the
sentinels
against
the
gates
and
they
are
now
forcing
the
doors
what
are
your
commands
listen
madame
said
gondy
the
moaning
of
waves
the
noise
of
thunder
the
roaring
of
a
volcano
can
not
be
compared
with
the
tempest
of
cries
heard
at
that
moment
what
are
my
commands
said
the
queen
yes
for
time
how
many
men
have
you
about
the
palais
royal
six
place
a
hundred
around
the
king
and
with
the
remainder
sweep
away
this
mob
for
madame
cried
mazarin
what
are
you
about
go
said
the
queen
comminges
went
out
with
a
soldier
s
passive
obedience
at
this
moment
a
monstrous
battering
was
heard
one
of
the
gates
began
to
yield
oh
madame
cried
mazarin
you
have
ruined
us
all
the
king
yourself
and
at
this
cry
from
the
soul
of
the
frightened
cardinal
anne
became
alarmed
in
her
turn
and
would
have
recalled
comminges
it
is
too
late
said
mazarin
tearing
his
hair
too
late
the
gale
had
given
way
hoarse
shouts
were
heard
from
the
excited
mob
d
artagnan
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
motioning
to
porthos
to
follow
his
example
save
the
queen
cried
mazarin
to
the
coadjutor
gondy
sprang
to
the
window
and
threw
it
open
he
recognized
louvieres
at
the
head
of
a
troop
of
about
three
or
four
thousand
men
not
a
step
further
he
shouted
the
queen
is
signing
what
are
you
saying
asked
the
queen
the
truth
madame
said
mazarin
placing
a
pen
and
a
paper
before
her
you
must
then
he
added
sign
anne
i
implore
you
i
command
the
queen
fell
into
a
chair
took
the
pen
and
signed
the
people
kept
back
by
louvieres
had
not
made
another
step
forward
but
the
awful
murmuring
which
indicates
an
angry
people
continued
the
queen
had
written
the
keeper
of
the
prison
at
saint
germain
will
set
councillor
broussel
at
liberty
and
she
had
signed
it
the
coadjutor
whose
eyes
devoured
her
slightest
movements
seized
the
paper
immediately
the
signature
had
been
affixed
to
it
returned
to
the
window
and
waved
it
in
his
hand
this
is
the
order
he
said
all
paris
seemed
to
shout
with
joy
and
then
the
air
resounded
with
the
cries
of
long
live
broussel
long
live
the
coadjutor
long
live
the
queen
cried
de
gondy
but
the
cries
which
replied
to
his
were
poor
and
few
and
perhaps
he
had
but
uttered
it
to
make
anne
of
austria
sensible
of
her
weakness
and
now
that
you
have
obtained
what
you
want
go
said
she
monsieur
de
whenever
her
majesty
has
need
of
me
replied
the
coadjutor
bowing
her
majesty
knows
i
am
at
her
ah
cursed
priest
cried
anne
when
he
had
retired
stretching
out
her
arm
to
the
scarcely
closed
door
one
day
i
will
make
you
drink
the
dregs
of
the
atrocious
gall
you
have
poured
out
on
me
mazarin
wished
to
approach
her
leave
me
she
exclaimed
you
are
not
a
man
and
she
went
out
of
the
room
it
is
you
who
are
not
a
woman
muttered
mazarin
then
after
a
moment
of
reverie
he
remembered
where
he
had
left
d
artagnan
and
porthos
and
that
they
must
have
overheard
everything
he
knit
his
brows
and
went
direct
to
the
tapestry
which
he
pushed
aside
the
closet
was
empty
at
the
queen
s
last
word
d
artagnan
had
dragged
porthos
into
the
gallery
thither
mazarin
went
in
his
turn
and
found
the
two
friends
walking
up
and
down
why
did
you
leave
the
closet
monsieur
d
artagnan
asked
the
cardinal
because
replied
d
artagnan
the
queen
desired
every
one
to
leave
and
i
thought
that
this
command
was
intended
for
us
as
well
as
for
the
and
you
have
been
here
since
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
said
d
artagnan
motioning
to
porthos
not
to
contradict
him
mazarin
saw
the
sign
and
remained
convinced
that
d
artagnan
had
seen
and
heard
everything
but
he
was
pleased
with
his
falsehood
decidedly
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
are
the
man
i
have
been
seeking
you
may
reckon
upon
me
and
so
may
your
then
bowing
to
the
two
musketeers
with
his
most
gracious
smile
he
his
closet
more
calmly
for
on
the
departure
of
de
gondy
the
uproar
had
ceased
as
though
by
enchantment
misfortune
refreshes
the
memory
anne
of
austria
returned
to
her
oratory
furious
what
she
cried
wringing
her
beautiful
hands
what
the
people
have
seen
monsieur
de
conde
a
prince
of
the
blood
royal
arrested
by
my
maria
de
medicis
they
saw
my
their
former
regent
expelled
by
the
cardinal
they
saw
monsieur
de
vendome
that
is
to
say
the
son
of
henry
a
prisoner
at
vincennes
and
whilst
these
great
personages
were
imprisoned
insulted
and
threatened
they
said
nothing
and
now
for
a
broussel
good
god
what
then
is
to
become
of
royalty
the
queen
unconsciously
touched
here
upon
the
exciting
question
the
people
had
made
no
demonstration
for
the
princes
but
they
had
risen
for
broussel
they
were
taking
the
part
of
a
plebeian
and
in
defending
broussel
they
instinctively
felt
they
were
defending
themselves
during
this
time
mazarin
walked
up
and
down
the
study
glancing
from
time
to
time
at
his
beautiful
venetian
mirror
starred
in
every
direction
ah
he
said
it
is
sad
i
know
well
to
be
forced
to
yield
thus
but
pshaw
we
shall
have
our
revenge
what
matters
it
about
broussel
it
is
a
name
not
a
mazarin
clever
politician
as
he
was
was
for
once
mistaken
broussel
was
a
thing
not
a
name
the
next
morning
therefore
when
broussel
made
his
entrance
into
paris
in
a
large
carriage
having
his
son
louvieres
at
his
side
and
friquet
behind
the
vehicle
the
people
threw
themselves
in
his
way
and
cries
of
long
live
broussel
long
live
our
father
resounded
from
all
parts
and
was
death
to
mazarin
s
ears
and
the
cardinal
s
spies
brought
bad
news
from
every
direction
which
greatly
agitated
the
minister
but
was
calmly
received
by
the
queen
the
latter
seemed
to
be
maturing
in
her
mind
some
great
stroke
a
fact
which
increased
the
uneasiness
of
the
cardinal
who
knew
the
proud
princess
and
dreaded
much
the
determination
of
anne
of
austria
the
coadjutor
returned
to
parliament
more
a
monarch
than
king
queen
and
cardinal
all
three
together
by
his
advice
a
decree
from
parliament
summoned
the
citizens
to
lay
down
their
arms
and
demolish
the
barricades
they
now
knew
that
it
required
but
one
hour
to
take
up
arms
again
and
one
night
to
reconstruct
the
barricades
rochefort
had
returned
to
the
chevalier
d
humieres
his
fifty
horsemen
less
two
missing
at
roll
call
but
the
chevalier
was
himself
at
heart
a
frondist
and
would
hear
nothing
said
of
compensation
the
mendicant
had
gone
to
his
old
place
on
the
steps
of
saint
eustache
and
was
again
distributing
holy
water
with
one
hand
and
asking
alms
with
the
other
no
one
could
suspect
that
those
two
hands
had
been
engaged
with
others
in
drawing
out
from
the
social
edifice
the
keystone
of
royalty
louvieres
was
proud
and
satisfied
he
had
taken
revenge
on
mazarin
and
had
aided
in
his
father
s
deliverance
from
prison
his
name
had
been
mentioned
as
a
name
of
terror
at
the
palais
royal
laughingly
he
said
to
the
councillor
restored
to
his
family
do
you
think
father
that
if
now
i
should
ask
for
a
company
the
queen
would
give
it
to
me
d
artagnan
profited
by
this
interval
of
calm
to
send
away
raoul
whom
he
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
shut
up
during
the
riot
and
who
wished
positively
to
strike
a
blow
for
one
party
or
the
other
raoul
had
offered
some
opposition
at
first
but
d
artagnan
made
use
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
s
name
and
after
paying
a
visit
to
madame
de
chevreuse
raoul
started
to
rejoin
the
army
rochefort
alone
was
dissatisfied
with
the
termination
of
affairs
he
had
written
to
the
duc
de
beaufort
to
come
and
the
duke
was
about
to
arrive
and
he
would
find
paris
tranquil
he
went
to
the
coadjutor
to
consult
with
him
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
send
word
to
the
duke
to
stop
on
the
road
but
gondy
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
said
let
him
continue
his
all
is
not
then
over
asked
rochefort
my
dear
count
we
have
only
just
what
induces
you
to
think
so
the
knowledge
that
i
have
of
the
queen
s
heart
she
will
not
rest
contented
is
she
then
preparing
for
a
stroke
i
hope
come
let
us
see
what
you
i
know
that
she
has
written
to
the
prince
to
return
in
haste
from
the
ah
ha
said
rochefort
you
are
right
we
must
let
monsieur
de
beaufort
in
fact
the
evening
after
this
conversation
the
report
was
circulated
that
the
prince
de
conde
had
arrived
it
was
a
very
simple
natural
circumstance
and
yet
it
created
a
profound
sensation
it
was
said
that
madame
de
longueville
for
whom
the
prince
had
more
than
a
brother
s
affection
and
in
whom
he
had
confided
had
been
indiscreet
his
confidence
had
unveiled
the
sinister
project
of
the
queen
even
on
the
night
of
the
prince
s
return
some
citizens
bolder
than
the
rest
such
as
the
sheriffs
captains
and
the
quartermaster
went
from
house
to
house
among
their
friends
saying
why
do
we
not
take
the
king
and
place
him
in
the
hotel
de
ville
it
is
a
shame
to
leave
him
to
be
educated
by
our
enemies
who
will
give
him
evil
counsel
whereas
brought
up
by
the
coadjutor
for
instance
he
would
imbibe
national
principles
and
love
his
that
night
the
question
was
secretly
agitated
and
on
the
morrow
the
gray
and
black
cloaks
the
patrols
of
armed
and
the
bands
of
mendicants
reappeared
the
queen
had
passed
the
night
in
lonely
conference
with
the
prince
who
had
entered
the
oratory
at
midnight
and
did
not
leave
till
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
at
five
o
clock
anne
went
to
the
cardinal
s
room
if
she
had
not
yet
taken
any
repose
he
at
least
was
already
up
six
days
had
already
passed
out
of
the
ten
he
had
asked
from
mordaunt
he
was
therefore
occupied
in
revising
his
reply
to
cromwell
when
some
one
knocked
gently
at
the
door
of
communication
with
the
queen
s
apartments
anne
of
austria
alone
was
permitted
to
enter
by
that
door
the
cardinal
therefore
rose
to
open
it
the
queen
was
in
a
morning
gown
but
it
became
her
still
for
like
diana
of
poictiers
and
ninon
anne
of
austria
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
remaining
ever
beautiful
nevertheless
this
morning
she
looked
handsomer
than
usual
for
her
eyes
had
all
the
sparkle
inward
satisfaction
adds
to
expression
what
is
the
matter
madame
said
mazarin
uneasily
you
seem
secretly
yes
giulio
she
said
proud
and
happy
for
i
have
found
the
means
of
strangling
this
you
are
a
great
politician
my
queen
said
mazarin
let
us
hear
the
and
he
hid
what
he
had
written
by
sliding
the
letter
under
a
folio
of
blank
paper
you
know
said
the
queen
that
they
want
to
take
the
king
away
from
me
alas
yes
and
to
hang
they
shall
not
have
the
nor
hang
listen
i
want
to
carry
off
my
son
from
them
with
yourself
i
wish
that
this
event
which
on
the
day
it
is
known
will
completely
change
the
aspect
of
affairs
should
be
accomplished
without
the
knowledge
of
any
others
but
yourself
myself
and
a
third
and
who
is
this
third
person
monsieur
le
he
has
come
then
as
they
told
me
last
and
you
have
seen
him
he
has
just
left
and
will
he
aid
this
project
the
plan
is
his
and
paris
he
will
starve
it
out
and
force
it
to
surrender
at
the
plan
is
not
wanting
in
grandeur
i
see
but
one
what
is
it
a
senseless
word
nothing
is
on
in
execution
we
have
money
a
little
said
mazarin
trembling
lest
anne
should
ask
to
draw
upon
his
purse
troops
five
or
six
thousand
courage
then
the
thing
is
easy
oh
do
think
of
it
giulio
paris
this
odious
paris
waking
up
one
morning
without
queen
or
king
surrounded
besieged
famished
having
for
its
sole
resource
its
stupid
parliament
and
their
coadjutor
with
crooked
limbs
charming
charming
said
mazarin
i
can
imagine
the
effect
i
do
not
see
the
i
will
find
the
means
you
are
aware
it
will
be
war
civil
war
furious
devouring
implacable
oh
yes
yes
war
said
anne
of
austria
yes
i
will
reduce
this
rebellious
city
to
ashes
i
will
extinguish
the
fire
with
blood
i
will
perpetuate
the
crime
and
punishment
by
making
a
frightful
example
paris
i
i
detest
i
loathe
it
very
fine
anne
you
are
now
sanguinary
but
take
care
we
are
not
in
the
time
of
malatesta
and
castruccio
castracani
you
will
get
yourself
decapitated
my
beautiful
queen
and
that
would
be
a
you
faintly
it
is
dangerous
to
go
to
war
with
a
nation
look
at
your
brother
monarch
charles
i
he
is
badly
off
very
we
are
in
france
and
i
am
so
much
the
worse
i
had
much
rather
you
were
french
and
myself
also
they
would
hate
us
both
nevertheless
you
consent
yes
if
the
thing
be
it
is
it
is
i
who
tell
you
so
make
preparations
for
i
i
am
always
prepared
to
go
only
as
you
know
i
never
do
go
and
perhaps
shall
go
this
time
as
little
as
in
short
if
i
go
will
you
go
too
i
will
you
torment
me
giulio
with
your
fears
and
what
are
you
afraid
of
then
of
many
what
are
they
mazarin
s
face
smiling
as
it
was
became
clouded
anne
said
he
you
are
but
a
woman
and
as
a
woman
you
may
insult
men
at
your
ease
knowing
that
you
can
do
it
with
impunity
you
accuse
me
of
fear
i
have
not
so
much
as
you
have
since
i
do
not
fly
as
you
do
against
whom
do
they
cry
out
is
it
against
you
or
against
myself
whom
would
they
hang
yourself
or
me
well
i
can
weather
the
storm
i
whom
notwithstanding
you
tax
with
fear
not
with
bravado
that
is
not
my
way
but
i
am
firm
imitate
me
make
less
hubbub
and
think
more
deeply
you
cry
very
loud
you
end
by
doing
nothing
you
talk
of
flying
mazarin
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
taking
the
queen
s
hand
led
her
to
the
window
look
he
said
well
said
the
queen
blinded
by
her
obstinacy
well
what
do
you
see
from
this
window
if
i
am
not
mistaken
those
are
citizens
helmeted
and
mailed
armed
with
good
muskets
as
in
the
time
of
the
league
and
whose
eyes
are
so
intently
fixed
on
this
window
that
they
will
see
you
if
you
raise
that
curtain
much
and
now
come
to
the
other
side
what
do
you
see
creatures
of
the
people
armed
with
halberds
guarding
your
doors
you
will
see
the
same
at
every
opening
from
this
palace
to
which
i
should
lead
you
your
doors
are
guarded
the
airholes
of
your
cellars
are
guarded
and
i
could
say
to
you
as
that
good
la
ramee
said
to
me
of
the
duc
de
beaufort
you
must
be
either
bird
or
mouse
to
get
he
did
get
out
do
you
think
of
escaping
in
the
same
way
i
am
a
prisoner
then
parbleu
said
mazarin
i
have
been
proving
it
to
you
this
last
and
he
quietly
resumed
his
dispatch
at
the
place
where
he
had
been
interrupted
anne
trembling
with
anger
and
scarlet
with
humiliation
left
the
room
shutting
the
door
violently
after
her
mazarin
did
not
even
turn
around
when
once
more
in
her
own
apartment
anne
fell
into
a
chair
and
wept
then
suddenly
struck
with
an
idea
i
am
saved
she
exclaimed
rising
oh
yes
yes
i
know
a
man
who
will
find
the
means
of
taking
me
from
paris
a
man
i
have
too
long
then
falling
into
a
reverie
she
added
however
with
an
expression
of
joy
ungrateful
woman
that
i
am
for
twenty
years
i
have
forgotten
this
man
whom
i
ought
to
have
made
a
marechal
of
france
my
expended
gold
caresses
dignities
on
concini
who
ruined
her
the
king
made
vitry
marechal
of
france
for
an
assassination
while
i
have
left
in
obscurity
in
poverty
the
noble
d
artagnan
who
saved
me
and
running
to
a
table
on
which
were
paper
pens
and
ink
she
hastily
began
to
write
the
interview
it
had
been
d
artagnan
s
practice
ever
since
the
riots
to
sleep
in
the
same
room
as
porthos
and
on
this
eventful
morning
he
was
still
there
sleeping
and
dreaming
that
a
yellow
cloud
had
overspread
the
sky
and
was
raining
gold
pieces
into
his
hat
which
he
held
out
till
it
was
overflowing
with
pistoles
as
for
porthos
he
dreamed
that
the
panels
of
his
carriage
were
not
capacious
enough
to
contain
the
armorial
bearings
he
had
ordered
to
be
painted
on
them
they
were
both
aroused
at
seven
o
clock
by
the
entrance
of
an
unliveried
servant
who
brought
a
letter
for
d
artagnan
from
whom
asked
the
gascon
from
the
queen
replied
the
servant
ho
said
porthos
raising
himself
in
his
bed
what
does
she
say
d
artagnan
requested
the
servant
to
wait
in
the
next
room
and
when
the
door
was
closed
he
sprang
up
from
his
bed
and
read
rapidly
whilst
porthos
looked
at
him
with
starting
eyes
not
daring
to
ask
a
single
question
friend
porthos
said
d
artagnan
handing
the
letter
to
him
this
time
at
least
you
are
sure
of
your
title
of
baron
and
i
of
my
captaincy
read
for
yourself
and
porthos
took
the
letter
and
with
a
trembling
voice
read
the
following
words
the
queen
wishes
to
speak
to
monsieur
d
artagnan
who
must
follow
the
well
exclaimed
porthos
i
see
nothing
in
that
very
but
i
see
much
that
is
very
extraordinary
in
it
replied
d
artagnan
it
is
evident
by
their
sending
for
me
that
matters
are
becoming
complicated
just
reflect
a
little
what
an
agitation
the
queen
s
mind
must
be
in
for
her
to
have
remembered
me
after
twenty
it
is
true
said
porthos
sharpen
your
sword
baron
load
your
pistols
and
give
some
corn
to
the
horses
for
i
will
answer
for
it
something
will
happen
ere
but
stop
do
you
think
it
can
be
a
trap
that
they
are
laying
for
us
suggested
porthos
incessantly
thinking
how
his
greatness
must
be
irksome
to
inferior
people
if
it
is
a
snare
replied
d
artagnan
i
shall
scent
it
out
be
assured
if
mazarin
is
an
italian
i
am
a
and
d
artagnan
dressed
himself
in
an
instant
whilst
porthos
still
in
bed
was
hooking
on
his
cloak
for
him
a
second
knock
at
the
door
was
heard
come
in
exclaimed
d
artagnan
and
another
servant
entered
from
his
eminence
cardinal
mazarin
presenting
a
letter
d
artagnan
looked
at
porthos
a
complicated
affair
said
porthos
where
will
you
begin
it
is
arranged
capitally
his
eminence
expects
me
in
half
an
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
turning
to
the
servant
tell
his
eminence
that
in
half
an
hour
i
shall
be
at
his
it
is
very
fortunate
resumed
the
gascon
when
the
valet
had
retired
that
he
did
not
meet
the
other
do
you
not
think
that
they
have
sent
for
you
both
for
the
same
thing
i
do
not
think
it
i
am
certain
of
quick
quick
d
artagnan
remember
that
the
queen
awaits
you
and
after
the
queen
the
cardinal
and
after
the
cardinal
d
artagnan
summoned
anne
of
austria
s
servant
and
signified
that
he
was
ready
to
follow
him
into
the
queen
s
presence
the
servant
conducted
him
by
the
rue
des
petits
champs
and
turning
to
the
left
entered
the
little
garden
gate
leading
into
the
rue
richelieu
then
they
gained
the
private
staircase
and
d
artagnan
was
ushered
into
the
oratory
a
certain
emotion
for
which
he
could
not
account
made
the
lieutenant
s
heart
beat
he
had
no
longer
the
assurance
of
youth
experience
had
taught
him
the
importance
of
past
events
formerly
he
would
have
approached
the
queen
as
a
young
man
who
bends
before
a
woman
but
now
it
was
a
different
thing
he
answered
her
summons
as
an
humble
soldier
obeys
an
illustrious
general
the
silence
of
the
oratory
was
at
last
disturbed
by
the
slight
rustling
of
silk
and
d
artagnan
started
when
he
perceived
the
tapestry
raised
by
a
white
hand
which
by
its
form
its
color
and
its
beauty
he
recognized
as
that
royal
hand
which
had
one
day
been
presented
to
him
to
kiss
the
queen
entered
it
is
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
she
said
fixing
a
gaze
full
of
melancholy
interest
on
the
countenance
of
the
officer
and
i
know
you
well
look
at
me
well
in
your
turn
i
am
the
queen
do
you
recognize
me
no
madame
replied
d
artagnan
but
are
you
no
longer
aware
continued
anne
giving
that
sweet
expression
to
her
voice
which
she
could
do
at
will
that
in
former
days
the
queen
had
once
need
of
a
young
brave
and
devoted
cavalier
that
she
found
this
cavalier
and
that
although
he
might
have
thought
that
she
had
forgotten
him
she
had
kept
a
place
for
him
in
the
depths
of
her
heart
no
madame
i
was
ignorant
of
that
said
the
musketeer
so
much
the
worse
sir
said
anne
of
austria
so
much
the
worse
at
least
for
the
queen
for
she
has
need
of
the
same
courage
and
the
same
what
exclaimed
d
artagnan
does
the
queen
surrounded
as
she
is
by
such
devoted
servants
such
wise
counselors
men
in
short
so
great
by
merit
or
position
does
she
deign
to
cast
her
eyes
on
an
obscure
soldier
anne
understood
this
covert
reproach
and
was
more
moved
than
irritated
by
it
she
had
many
a
time
felt
humiliated
by
the
and
disinterestedness
shown
by
the
gascon
gentleman
she
had
allowed
herself
to
be
exceeded
in
generosity
all
that
you
tell
me
of
those
by
whom
i
am
surrounded
monsieur
d
artagnan
is
doubtless
true
said
the
queen
but
i
have
confidence
in
you
alone
i
know
that
you
belong
to
the
cardinal
but
belong
to
me
as
well
and
i
will
take
upon
myself
the
making
of
your
fortune
come
will
you
do
what
formerly
the
gentleman
you
do
not
know
did
for
the
queen
i
will
do
everything
your
majesty
commands
replied
d
artagnan
the
queen
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
seeing
the
cautious
demeanor
of
the
musketeer
perhaps
you
like
repose
she
said
i
do
not
know
for
i
have
never
had
it
have
you
any
friends
i
had
three
two
of
whom
have
left
paris
to
go
i
know
not
where
one
alone
is
left
to
me
but
he
is
one
of
those
known
i
believe
to
the
cavalier
of
whom
your
majesty
did
me
the
honor
to
very
good
said
the
queen
you
and
your
friend
are
worth
an
what
am
i
to
do
madame
return
at
five
o
clock
and
i
will
tell
you
but
do
not
breathe
to
a
living
soul
sir
the
rendezvous
which
i
give
no
swear
it
upon
the
madame
i
have
never
been
false
to
my
word
when
i
say
i
will
not
do
a
thing
i
mean
the
queen
although
astonished
at
this
language
to
which
she
was
not
accustomed
from
her
courtiers
argued
from
it
a
happy
omen
of
the
zeal
with
which
d
artagnan
would
serve
her
in
the
accomplishment
of
her
project
it
was
one
of
the
gascon
s
artifices
to
hide
his
deep
cunning
occasionally
under
an
appearance
of
rough
loyalty
has
the
queen
any
further
commands
for
me
now
asked
d
artagnan
no
sir
replied
anne
of
austria
and
you
may
retire
until
the
time
that
i
mentioned
to
d
artagnan
bowed
and
went
out
diable
he
exclaimed
when
the
door
was
shut
they
seem
to
have
the
greatest
need
of
me
just
then
as
the
half
hour
had
already
glided
by
he
crossed
the
gallery
and
knocked
at
the
cardinal
s
door
bernouin
introduced
him
i
come
for
your
commands
my
lord
he
said
and
according
to
his
custom
d
artagnan
glanced
rapidly
around
and
remarked
that
mazarin
had
a
sealed
letter
before
him
but
it
was
so
placed
on
the
desk
that
he
could
not
see
to
whom
it
was
addressed
you
come
from
the
queen
said
mazarin
looking
fixedly
at
d
artagnan
i
my
lord
who
told
you
that
nobody
but
i
know
i
regret
infinitely
to
tell
you
my
lord
that
you
are
mistaken
replied
the
gascon
impudently
firm
to
the
promise
he
had
just
made
to
anne
of
austria
i
opened
the
door
of
the
myself
and
i
saw
you
enter
at
the
end
of
the
because
i
was
shown
up
the
private
how
so
i
know
not
it
must
have
been
a
mazarin
was
aware
that
it
was
not
easy
to
make
d
artagnan
reveal
anything
he
was
desirous
of
hiding
so
he
gave
up
for
the
time
the
discovery
of
the
mystery
the
gascon
was
concealing
let
us
speak
of
my
affairs
said
mazarin
since
you
will
tell
me
naught
of
yours
are
you
fond
of
traveling
my
life
has
been
passed
on
the
high
would
anything
retain
you
particularly
in
paris
nothing
but
an
order
from
a
superior
would
retain
me
in
very
well
here
is
a
letter
which
must
be
taken
to
its
to
its
address
my
lord
but
it
has
in
fact
the
side
of
the
letter
opposite
the
seal
was
blank
i
must
tell
you
resumed
mazarin
that
it
is
in
a
double
i
understand
and
i
am
to
take
off
the
first
one
when
i
have
reached
a
certain
place
just
so
take
it
and
go
you
have
a
friend
monsieur
du
vallon
whom
i
like
much
let
him
accompany
the
devil
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
he
knows
that
we
overheard
his
conversation
yesterday
and
he
wants
to
get
us
away
from
do
you
hesitate
asked
mazarin
no
my
lord
and
i
will
set
out
at
once
there
is
one
thing
only
which
i
must
what
is
it
that
your
eminence
will
go
at
once
to
the
what
for
merely
to
say
these
words
i
am
going
to
send
monsieur
d
artagnan
away
and
i
wish
him
to
set
out
i
told
you
said
mazarin
that
you
had
seen
the
i
had
the
honor
of
saying
to
your
eminence
that
there
had
been
some
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
may
i
venture
to
repeat
my
prayer
to
your
eminence
very
well
i
will
go
wait
here
for
and
looking
attentively
around
him
to
see
if
he
had
left
any
of
his
keys
in
his
closets
mazarin
went
out
ten
minutes
elapsed
during
which
d
artagnan
made
every
effort
to
read
through
the
first
envelope
what
was
written
on
the
second
but
he
did
not
succeed
mazarin
returned
pale
and
evidently
thoughtful
he
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
d
artagnan
proceeded
to
examine
his
face
as
he
had
just
examined
the
letter
he
held
but
the
envelope
which
covered
his
countenance
appeared
as
impenetrable
as
that
which
covered
the
letter
ah
thought
the
gascon
he
looks
displeased
can
it
be
with
me
he
meditates
is
it
about
sending
me
to
the
bastile
all
very
fine
my
lord
but
at
the
very
first
hint
you
give
of
such
a
thing
i
will
strangle
you
and
become
frondist
i
should
be
carried
home
in
triumph
like
monsieur
broussel
and
athos
would
proclaim
me
the
french
brutus
it
would
be
exceedingly
the
gascon
with
his
vivid
imagination
had
already
seen
the
advantage
to
be
derived
from
his
situation
mazarin
gave
however
no
order
of
the
kind
but
on
the
contrary
began
to
be
insinuating
you
were
right
he
said
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
and
you
can
not
set
out
yet
i
beg
you
to
return
me
that
d
artagnan
obeyed
and
mazarin
ascertained
that
the
seal
was
intact
i
shall
want
you
this
evening
he
said
return
in
two
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
i
have
an
appointment
in
two
hours
which
i
can
not
do
not
be
uneasy
said
mazarin
it
is
the
good
thought
d
artagnan
i
fancied
it
was
return
then
at
five
o
clock
and
bring
that
worthy
monsieur
du
vallon
with
you
only
leave
him
in
the
as
i
wish
to
speak
to
you
d
artagnan
bowed
and
thought
both
at
the
same
hour
both
commands
alike
both
at
the
palais
royal
monsieur
de
gondy
would
pay
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
such
a
secret
you
are
thoughtful
said
mazarin
uneasily
yes
i
was
thinking
whether
we
ought
to
come
armed
or
armed
to
the
teeth
replied
mazarin
very
well
my
lord
it
shall
be
d
artagnan
saluted
went
out
and
hastened
to
repeat
to
his
friend
mazarin
s
flattering
promises
which
gave
porthos
an
indescribable
happiness
the
flight
when
d
artagnan
returned
to
the
palais
royal
at
five
o
clock
it
presented
in
spite
of
the
excitement
which
reigned
in
the
town
a
spectacle
of
the
greatest
rejoicing
nor
was
that
surprising
the
queen
had
restored
broussel
and
blancmesnil
to
the
people
and
had
therefore
nothing
to
fear
since
the
people
had
nothing
more
just
then
to
ask
for
the
return
also
of
the
conqueror
of
lens
was
the
pretext
for
giving
a
grand
banquet
the
princes
and
princesses
were
invited
and
their
carriages
had
crowded
the
court
since
noon
then
after
dinner
the
queen
was
to
have
a
play
in
her
apartment
anne
of
austria
had
never
appeared
more
brilliant
than
on
that
day
radiant
with
grace
and
wit
mazarin
disappeared
as
they
rose
from
table
he
found
d
artagnan
waiting
for
him
already
at
his
post
in
the
the
cardinal
advanced
to
him
with
a
smile
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
led
him
into
his
study
my
dear
d
artagnan
said
the
minister
sitting
down
i
am
about
to
give
you
the
greatest
proof
of
confidence
that
a
minister
can
give
an
i
hope
said
d
artagnan
bowing
that
you
give
it
my
lord
without
hesitation
and
with
the
conviction
that
i
am
worthy
of
more
worthy
than
any
one
in
paris
my
dear
friend
therefore
i
apply
to
you
we
are
about
to
leave
this
evening
continued
mazarin
my
dear
d
artagnan
the
welfare
of
the
state
is
deposited
in
your
he
paused
explain
yourself
my
lord
i
am
the
queen
has
resolved
to
make
a
little
excursion
with
the
king
to
saint
aha
said
d
artagnan
that
is
to
say
the
queen
wishes
to
leave
a
woman
s
caprice
you
yes
i
understand
perfectly
said
d
artagnan
it
was
for
this
she
summoned
you
this
morning
and
that
she
told
you
to
return
at
five
o
was
it
worth
while
to
wish
me
to
swear
this
morning
that
i
would
mention
the
appointment
to
no
one
muttered
d
artagnan
oh
women
women
whether
queens
or
not
they
are
always
the
do
you
disapprove
of
this
journey
my
dear
d
artagnan
asked
mazarin
anxiously
i
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
why
should
i
because
you
shrug
your
it
is
a
way
i
have
of
speaking
to
myself
i
neither
approve
nor
disapprove
my
lord
i
merely
await
your
good
it
is
you
accordingly
that
i
have
pitched
upon
to
conduct
the
king
and
the
queen
to
saint
liar
thought
d
artagnan
you
see
therefore
continued
the
cardinal
perceiving
d
artagnan
s
composure
that
as
i
have
told
you
the
welfare
of
the
state
is
placed
in
your
yes
my
lord
and
i
feel
the
whole
responsibility
of
such
a
you
accept
however
i
always
do
you
think
the
thing
possible
everything
is
shall
you
be
attacked
on
the
road
and
what
will
you
do
in
that
case
i
shall
pass
through
those
who
attack
and
suppose
you
can
not
pass
through
them
so
much
the
worse
for
them
i
shall
pass
over
and
you
will
place
the
king
and
queen
in
safety
also
at
saint
germain
on
your
life
on
my
you
are
a
hero
my
friend
said
mazarin
gazing
at
the
musketeer
with
admiration
d
artagnan
smiled
and
i
asked
mazarin
after
a
moment
s
silence
how
and
you
my
lord
if
i
wish
to
leave
that
would
be
much
more
why
so
your
eminence
might
be
even
under
this
disguise
asked
mazarin
raising
a
cloak
which
covered
an
upon
which
lay
a
complete
dress
for
an
officer
of
and
red
entirely
embroidered
with
silver
if
your
eminence
is
disguised
it
will
be
almost
ah
said
mazarin
breathing
more
freely
but
it
will
be
necessary
for
your
eminence
to
do
what
the
other
day
you
declared
you
should
have
done
in
our
place
cry
down
with
mazarin
i
will
down
with
mazarin
in
french
in
good
french
my
lord
take
care
of
your
accent
they
killed
six
thousand
angevins
in
sicily
because
they
pronounced
italian
badly
take
care
that
the
french
do
not
take
their
revenge
on
you
for
the
sicilian
i
will
do
my
the
streets
are
full
of
armed
men
continued
d
artagnan
are
you
sure
that
no
one
is
aware
of
the
queen
s
project
mazarin
reflected
this
affair
would
give
a
fine
opportunity
for
a
traitor
my
lord
the
chance
of
being
attacked
would
be
an
excuse
for
mazarin
shuddered
but
he
reflected
that
a
man
who
had
the
least
intention
to
betray
would
not
warn
first
and
therefore
added
he
quietly
i
have
not
confidence
in
every
one
the
proof
of
which
is
that
i
have
fixed
upon
you
to
escort
shall
you
not
go
with
the
queen
no
replied
mazarin
then
you
will
start
after
the
queen
no
said
mazarin
again
ah
said
d
artagnan
who
began
to
understand
yes
continued
the
cardinal
i
have
my
plan
with
the
queen
i
double
her
risk
after
the
queen
her
departure
would
double
mine
then
the
court
once
safe
i
might
be
forgotten
the
great
are
often
very
true
said
d
artagnan
fixing
his
eyes
in
spite
of
himself
on
the
queen
s
diamond
which
mazarin
wore
on
his
finger
mazarin
followed
the
direction
of
his
eyes
and
gently
turned
the
hoop
of
the
ring
inside
i
wish
he
said
with
his
cunning
smile
to
prevent
them
from
being
ungrateful
to
it
is
but
christian
charity
replied
d
artagnan
not
to
lead
one
s
neighbors
into
it
is
exactly
for
that
reason
said
mazarin
that
i
wish
to
start
before
d
artagnan
smiled
he
was
just
the
man
to
understand
the
astute
italian
mazarin
saw
the
smile
and
profited
by
the
moment
you
will
begin
therefore
by
taking
me
first
out
of
paris
will
you
not
my
dear
d
artagnan
a
difficult
commission
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
resuming
his
serious
manner
but
said
mazarin
you
did
not
make
so
many
difficulties
with
regard
to
the
king
and
the
king
and
the
queen
are
my
king
and
queen
replied
the
musketeer
my
life
is
theirs
and
i
must
give
it
for
them
if
they
ask
it
what
have
i
to
say
that
is
true
murmured
mazarin
in
a
low
tone
but
as
thy
life
is
not
mine
i
suppose
i
must
buy
it
must
i
not
and
sighing
deeply
he
began
to
turn
the
hoop
of
his
ring
outside
again
d
artagnan
smiled
these
two
men
met
at
one
point
and
that
was
cunning
had
they
been
actuated
equally
by
courage
the
one
would
have
done
great
things
for
the
other
but
also
said
mazarin
you
must
understand
that
if
i
ask
this
service
from
you
it
is
with
the
intention
of
being
is
it
still
only
an
intention
your
eminence
asked
d
artagnan
stay
said
mazarin
drawing
the
ring
from
his
finger
my
dear
d
artagnan
there
is
a
diamond
which
belonged
to
you
formerly
it
is
but
just
it
should
return
to
you
take
it
i
d
artagnan
spared
mazarin
the
trouble
of
insisting
and
after
looking
to
see
if
the
stone
was
the
same
and
assuring
himself
of
the
purity
of
its
water
he
took
it
and
passed
it
on
his
finger
with
indescribable
pleasure
i
valued
it
much
said
mazarin
giving
a
last
look
at
it
nevertheless
i
give
it
to
you
with
great
and
i
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
accept
it
as
it
is
given
come
let
us
speak
of
your
little
affairs
you
wish
to
leave
before
everybody
and
at
what
hour
at
ten
o
and
the
queen
at
what
time
is
it
her
wish
to
start
at
then
it
is
possible
i
can
get
you
out
of
paris
and
leave
you
beyond
the
barriere
and
can
return
for
capital
but
how
will
you
get
me
out
of
paris
oh
as
to
that
you
must
leave
it
to
i
give
you
absolute
power
therefore
take
as
large
an
escort
as
you
d
artagnan
shook
his
head
it
seems
to
me
however
said
mazarin
the
safest
yes
for
you
my
lord
but
not
for
the
queen
you
must
leave
it
to
me
and
give
me
the
entire
direction
of
the
nevertheless
or
find
some
one
else
continued
d
artagnan
turning
his
back
oh
muttered
mazarin
i
do
believe
he
is
going
off
with
the
diamond
d
artagnan
my
dear
d
artagnan
he
called
out
in
a
coaxing
voice
will
you
answer
for
everything
i
will
answer
for
nothing
i
will
do
my
well
then
let
us
go
i
must
trust
to
it
is
very
fortunate
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
you
will
be
here
at
and
i
shall
find
your
eminence
ready
certainly
quite
well
then
it
is
a
settled
thing
and
now
my
lord
will
you
obtain
for
me
an
audience
with
the
queen
for
what
purpose
i
wish
to
receive
her
majesty
s
commands
from
her
own
she
desired
me
to
give
them
to
she
may
have
forgotten
you
really
wish
to
see
her
it
is
indispensable
my
mazarin
hesitated
for
one
instant
but
d
artagnan
was
firm
come
then
said
the
minister
i
will
conduct
you
to
her
but
remember
not
one
word
of
our
what
has
passed
between
us
concerns
ourselves
alone
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
swear
to
be
i
never
swear
my
lord
i
say
yes
or
no
and
as
i
am
a
gentleman
i
keep
my
come
then
i
see
that
i
must
trust
unreservedly
to
believe
me
my
lord
it
will
be
your
best
come
said
mazarin
conducting
d
artagnan
into
the
queen
s
oratory
and
desiring
him
to
wait
there
he
did
not
wait
long
for
in
five
minutes
the
queen
entered
in
full
gala
costume
thus
dressed
she
scarcely
appeared
years
of
age
she
was
still
exceedingly
handsome
it
is
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
she
said
smiling
graciously
i
thank
you
for
having
insisted
on
seeing
i
ought
to
ask
your
majesty
s
pardon
but
i
wished
to
receive
your
commands
from
your
own
do
you
accept
the
commission
which
i
have
intrusted
to
you
with
very
well
be
here
at
i
will
not
monsieur
d
artagnan
continued
the
queen
i
know
your
disinterestedness
too
well
to
speak
of
my
own
gratitude
at
such
a
moment
but
i
swear
to
you
that
i
shall
not
forget
this
second
service
as
i
forgot
the
your
majesty
is
free
to
forget
or
to
remember
as
it
pleases
you
and
i
know
not
what
you
mean
said
d
artagnan
bowing
go
sir
said
the
queen
with
her
most
bewitching
smile
go
and
return
at
and
d
artagnan
retired
but
as
he
passed
out
he
glanced
at
the
curtain
through
which
the
queen
had
entered
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
tapestry
he
remarked
the
tip
of
a
velvet
slipper
good
thought
he
mazarin
has
been
listening
to
discover
whether
i
betrayed
him
in
truth
that
italian
puppet
does
not
deserve
the
services
of
an
honest
d
artagnan
was
not
less
exact
to
his
appointment
and
at
nine
o
clock
he
entered
the
he
found
the
cardinal
dressed
as
an
officer
and
he
looked
very
well
in
that
costume
which
as
we
have
already
said
he
wore
elegantly
only
he
was
very
pale
and
trembled
slightly
quite
alone
he
asked
yes
my
and
that
worthy
monsieur
du
vallon
are
we
not
to
enjoy
his
society
certainly
my
lord
he
is
waiting
in
his
carriage
at
the
gate
of
the
garden
of
the
palais
and
we
start
in
his
carriage
then
yes
my
and
with
us
no
other
escort
but
you
two
is
it
not
enough
one
of
us
would
really
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
cardinal
your
coolness
startles
i
should
have
thought
on
the
contrary
that
it
ought
to
have
inspired
you
with
and
bernouin
do
i
not
take
him
with
me
there
is
no
room
for
him
he
will
rejoin
your
let
us
go
said
mazarin
since
everything
must
be
done
as
you
my
lord
there
is
time
to
draw
back
said
d
artagnan
and
your
eminence
is
perfectly
not
at
all
not
at
all
said
mazarin
let
us
be
and
so
they
descended
the
private
stair
mazarin
leaning
on
the
arm
of
d
artagnan
a
hand
the
musketeer
felt
trembling
at
last
after
crossing
the
courts
of
the
palais
royal
where
there
still
remained
some
of
the
conveyances
of
late
guests
they
entered
the
garden
and
reached
the
little
gate
mazarin
attempted
to
open
it
by
a
key
which
he
took
from
his
pocket
but
with
such
shaking
fingers
that
he
could
not
find
the
keyhole
give
it
to
me
said
d
artagnan
who
when
the
gate
was
open
deposited
the
key
in
his
pocket
reckoning
upon
returning
by
that
gate
the
steps
were
already
down
and
the
door
open
mousqueton
stood
at
the
door
and
porthos
was
inside
the
carriage
mount
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
to
mazarin
who
sprang
into
the
carriage
without
waiting
for
a
second
bidding
d
artagnan
followed
him
and
mousqueton
having
closed
the
door
mounted
behind
the
carriage
with
many
groans
he
had
made
some
difficulties
about
going
under
pretext
that
he
still
suffered
from
his
wound
but
d
artagnan
had
said
to
him
remain
if
you
like
my
dear
monsieur
mouston
but
i
warn
you
that
paris
will
be
burnt
down
upon
which
mousqueton
had
declared
without
asking
anything
further
that
he
was
ready
to
follow
his
master
and
monsieur
d
artagnan
to
the
end
of
the
world
the
carriage
started
at
a
measured
pace
without
betraying
by
the
slightest
sign
that
it
contained
people
in
a
hurry
the
cardinal
wiped
his
forehead
with
his
handkerchief
and
looked
around
him
on
his
left
was
porthos
whilst
d
artagnan
was
on
his
right
each
guarded
a
door
and
served
as
a
rampart
to
him
on
either
side
before
him
on
the
front
seat
lay
two
pairs
of
pistols
one
in
front
of
porthos
and
the
other
of
d
artagnan
about
a
hundred
paces
from
the
palais
royal
a
patrol
stopped
the
carriage
who
goes
asked
the
captain
mazarin
replied
d
artagnan
bursting
into
a
laugh
the
cardinal
s
hair
stood
on
end
but
the
joke
appeared
an
excellent
one
to
the
citizens
who
seeing
the
conveyance
without
escort
and
unarmed
would
never
have
believed
in
the
possibility
of
so
great
an
imprudence
a
good
journey
to
ye
they
cried
allowing
it
to
pass
hem
said
d
artagnan
what
does
my
lord
think
of
that
reply
man
of
talent
cried
mazarin
in
truth
said
porthos
i
understand
but
now
about
the
middle
of
the
rue
des
petits
champs
they
were
stopped
by
a
second
patrol
who
goes
there
inquired
the
captain
of
the
patrol
keep
back
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
and
mazarin
buried
himself
so
far
behind
the
two
friends
that
he
disappeared
completely
hidden
between
them
who
goes
there
cried
the
same
voice
impatiently
whilst
d
artagnan
perceived
that
they
had
rushed
to
the
horses
heads
but
putting
his
head
out
of
the
carriage
eh
planchet
said
he
the
chief
approached
and
it
was
indeed
planchet
d
artagnan
had
recognized
the
voice
of
his
old
servant
how
sir
said
planchet
is
it
you
eh
mon
dieu
yes
my
good
friend
this
worthy
porthos
has
just
received
a
sword
wound
and
i
am
taking
him
to
his
country
house
at
saint
oh
really
said
planchet
porthos
said
d
artagnan
if
you
can
still
speak
say
a
word
my
dear
porthos
to
this
good
planchet
my
friend
said
porthos
in
a
melancholy
voice
i
am
very
ill
should
you
meet
a
doctor
you
will
do
me
a
favor
by
sending
him
to
oh
good
heaven
said
planchet
what
a
misfortune
and
how
did
it
happen
i
will
tell
you
all
about
it
replied
mousqueton
porthos
uttered
a
deep
groan
make
way
for
us
planchet
said
d
artagnan
in
a
whisper
to
him
or
he
will
not
arrive
alive
the
lungs
are
attacked
my
planchet
shook
his
head
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
says
in
that
case
things
look
then
he
exclaimed
turning
to
his
men
let
them
pass
they
are
the
carriage
resumed
its
course
and
mazarin
who
had
held
his
breath
ventured
to
breathe
again
bricconi
muttered
he
a
few
steps
in
advance
of
the
gate
of
saint
honore
they
met
a
third
troop
this
latter
party
was
composed
of
fellows
who
resembled
bandits
more
than
anything
else
they
were
the
men
of
the
beggar
of
saint
eustache
attention
porthos
cried
d
artagnan
porthos
placed
his
hand
on
the
pistols
what
is
it
asked
mazarin
my
lord
i
think
we
are
in
bad
a
man
advanced
to
the
door
with
a
kind
of
scythe
in
his
hand
qui
vive
he
asked
eh
rascal
said
d
artagnan
do
you
not
recognize
his
highness
the
prince
s
carriage
prince
or
not
said
the
man
open
we
are
here
to
guard
the
gate
and
no
one
whom
we
do
not
know
shall
what
is
to
be
done
said
porthos
pardieu
pass
replied
d
artagnan
but
how
asked
mazarin
through
or
over
coachman
gallop
the
coachman
raised
his
whip
not
a
step
further
said
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
the
captain
or
i
will
hamstring
your
peste
said
porthos
it
would
be
a
pity
animals
which
cost
me
a
hundred
pistoles
i
will
pay
you
two
hundred
for
them
said
mazarin
yes
but
when
once
they
are
hamstrung
our
necks
will
be
strung
if
one
of
them
comes
to
my
side
asked
porthos
must
i
kill
him
yes
by
a
blow
of
your
fist
if
you
can
we
will
not
fire
but
at
the
last
i
can
do
it
said
porthos
come
and
open
then
cried
d
artagnan
to
the
man
with
the
scythe
taking
one
of
the
pistols
up
by
the
muzzle
and
preparing
to
strike
with
the
handle
and
as
the
man
approached
d
artagnan
in
order
to
have
more
freedom
for
his
actions
leaned
half
out
of
the
door
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
those
of
the
mendicant
which
were
lighted
up
by
a
lantern
without
doubt
he
recognized
d
artagnan
for
he
became
deadly
pale
doubtless
the
musketeer
knew
him
for
his
hair
stood
up
on
his
head
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
cried
falling
back
a
step
it
is
monsieur
d
artagnan
let
him
d
artagnan
was
perhaps
about
to
reply
when
a
blow
similar
to
that
of
a
mallet
falling
on
the
head
of
an
ox
was
heard
the
noise
was
caused
by
porthos
who
had
just
knocked
down
his
man
d
artagnan
turned
around
and
saw
the
unfortunate
man
upon
his
back
about
four
paces
off
sdeath
cried
he
to
the
coachman
spur
your
horses
whip
get
on
the
coachman
bestowed
a
heavy
blow
of
the
whip
upon
his
horses
the
noble
animals
bounded
forward
then
cries
of
men
who
were
knocked
down
were
heard
then
a
double
concussion
was
felt
and
two
of
the
wheels
seemed
to
pass
over
a
round
and
flexible
body
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
then
the
carriage
cleared
the
gate
to
cours
la
reine
cried
d
artagnan
to
the
coachman
then
turning
to
mazarin
he
said
now
my
lord
you
can
say
five
paters
and
five
aves
in
thanks
to
heaven
for
your
deliverance
you
are
safe
you
are
mazarin
replied
only
by
a
groan
he
could
not
believe
in
such
a
miracle
five
minutes
later
the
carriage
stopped
having
reached
cours
la
reine
is
my
lord
pleased
with
his
escort
asked
d
artagnan
enchanted
monsieur
said
mazarin
venturing
his
head
out
of
one
of
the
windows
and
now
do
as
much
for
the
it
will
not
be
so
difficult
replied
d
artagnan
springing
to
the
ground
monsieur
du
vallon
i
commend
his
eminence
to
your
be
quite
at
ease
said
porthos
holding
out
his
hand
which
d
artagnan
took
and
shook
in
his
oh
cried
porthos
as
if
in
pain
d
artagnan
looked
with
surprise
at
his
friend
what
is
the
matter
then
he
asked
i
think
i
have
sprained
my
wrist
said
porthos
the
devil
why
you
strike
like
a
blind
or
a
deaf
it
was
necessary
my
man
was
going
to
fire
a
pistol
at
me
but
you
how
did
you
get
rid
of
yours
oh
mine
replied
d
artagnan
was
not
a
what
was
it
then
it
was
an
and
i
charmed
it
without
further
explanation
d
artagnan
took
the
pistols
which
were
upon
the
front
seat
placed
them
in
his
belt
wrapped
himself
in
his
cloak
and
not
wishing
to
enter
by
the
same
gate
as
that
through
which
they
had
left
he
took
his
way
toward
the
richelieu
gate
the
carriage
of
monsieur
le
coadjuteur
instead
of
returning
then
by
the
saint
honore
gate
d
artagnan
who
had
time
before
him
walked
around
and
by
the
porte
richelieu
he
was
approached
to
be
examined
and
when
it
was
discovered
by
his
plumed
hat
and
his
laced
coat
that
he
was
an
officer
of
the
musketeers
he
was
surrounded
with
the
intention
of
making
him
cry
down
with
mazarin
the
demonstration
did
not
fail
to
make
him
uneasy
at
first
but
when
he
discovered
what
it
meant
he
shouted
it
in
such
a
voice
that
even
the
most
exacting
were
satisfied
he
walked
down
the
rue
richelieu
meditating
how
he
should
carry
off
the
queen
in
her
turn
for
to
take
her
in
a
carriage
bearing
the
arms
of
france
was
not
to
be
thought
of
when
he
perceived
an
equipage
standing
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
belonging
to
madame
de
guemenee
he
was
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
ah
pardieu
he
exclaimed
that
would
be
fair
and
approaching
the
carriage
he
examined
the
arms
on
the
panels
and
the
livery
of
the
coachman
on
his
box
this
scrutiny
was
so
much
the
more
easy
the
coachman
being
sound
asleep
it
is
in
truth
monsieur
le
coadjuteur
s
carriage
said
d
artagnan
upon
my
honor
i
begin
to
think
that
heaven
favors
he
mounted
noiselessly
into
the
chariot
and
pulled
the
silk
cord
which
was
attached
to
the
coachman
s
little
finger
to
the
palais
royal
he
called
out
the
coachman
awoke
with
a
start
and
drove
off
in
the
direction
he
was
desired
never
doubting
but
that
the
order
had
come
from
his
master
the
porter
at
the
palace
was
about
to
close
the
gates
but
seeing
such
a
handsome
equipage
he
fancied
that
it
was
some
visit
of
importance
and
the
carriage
was
allowed
to
pass
and
to
stop
beneath
the
porch
it
was
then
only
the
coachman
perceived
the
grooms
were
not
behind
the
vehicle
he
fancied
monsieur
le
coadjuteur
had
sent
them
back
and
without
dropping
the
reins
he
sprang
from
his
box
to
open
the
door
d
artagnan
in
his
turn
sprang
to
the
ground
and
just
at
the
moment
when
the
coachman
alarmed
at
not
seeing
his
master
fell
back
a
step
he
seized
him
by
his
collar
with
the
left
whilst
with
the
right
hand
he
placed
the
muzzle
of
a
pistol
at
his
breast
pronounce
one
single
word
muttered
d
artagnan
and
you
are
a
dead
the
coachman
perceived
at
once
by
the
expression
of
the
man
who
thus
addressed
him
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
trap
and
he
remained
with
his
mouth
wide
open
and
his
eyes
portentously
staring
two
musketeers
were
pacing
the
court
to
whom
d
artagnan
called
by
their
names
monsieur
de
belliere
said
he
to
one
of
them
do
me
the
favor
to
take
the
reins
from
the
hands
of
this
worthy
man
mount
upon
the
box
and
drive
to
the
door
of
the
private
stair
and
wait
for
me
there
it
is
an
affair
of
importance
on
the
service
of
the
the
musketeer
who
knew
that
his
lieutenant
was
incapable
of
jesting
with
regard
to
the
service
obeyed
without
a
word
although
he
thought
the
order
strange
then
turning
toward
the
second
musketeer
d
artagnan
said
monsieur
du
verger
help
me
to
place
this
man
in
a
place
of
the
musketeer
thinking
that
his
lieutenant
had
just
arrested
some
prince
in
disguise
bowed
and
drawing
his
sword
signified
that
he
was
ready
d
artagnan
mounted
the
staircase
followed
by
his
prisoner
who
in
his
turn
was
followed
by
the
soldier
and
entered
mazarin
s
bernouin
was
waiting
there
impatient
for
news
of
his
master
well
sir
he
said
everything
goes
on
capitally
my
dear
monsieur
bernouin
but
here
is
a
man
whom
i
must
beg
you
to
put
in
a
safe
where
then
sir
where
you
like
provided
that
the
place
which
you
shall
choose
has
iron
shutters
secured
by
padlocks
and
a
door
that
can
be
we
have
that
sir
replied
bernouin
and
the
poor
coachman
was
conducted
to
a
closet
the
windows
of
which
were
barred
and
which
looked
very
much
like
a
prison
and
now
my
good
friend
said
d
artagnan
to
him
i
must
invite
you
to
deprive
yourself
for
my
sake
of
your
hat
and
the
coachman
as
we
can
well
understand
made
no
resistance
in
fact
he
was
so
astonished
at
what
had
happened
to
him
that
he
stammered
and
reeled
like
a
drunken
man
d
artagnan
deposited
his
clothes
under
the
arm
of
one
of
the
valets
and
now
monsieur
du
verger
he

after
conversing
with

affectionately
for

minutes
dismissed

at
this
moment
d
artagnan
entered
the
courtyard
of
the
palace
in
the
coadjutor

carriage
and
a
few
seconds
later
the
carriages

entered
her
oratory
which
was
lighted
by
a
single
lamp
of
venetian
crystal
she
saw
d

who
stood
expecting
her

was
already
dressed
with
the
exception
of
his
shoes
and
doublet
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
dressed
in
great
astonishment
overwhelming
laporte
with
questions
who
replied
only
in
these
words
sire
it
is
by
the
queen
s
the
bedclothes
were
thrown
back
exposing
the
king
s
bed
linen
which
was
so
worn
that
here
and
there
holes
could
be
seen
it
was
one
of
the
results
of
mazarin
s
niggardliness
the
queen
entered
and
d
artagnan
remained
at
the
door
as
soon
as
the
child
perceived
the
queen
he
escaped
from
laporte
and
ran
to
meet
her
anne
then
motioned
to
d
artagnan
to
approach
and
he
obeyed
my
son
said
anne
of
austria
pointing
to
the
musketeer
calm
standing
uncovered
here
is
monsieur
d
artagnan
who
is
as
brave
as
one
of
those
ancient
heroes
of
whom
you
like
so
much
to
hear
from
my
women
remember
his
name
well
and
look
at
him
well
that
his
face
may
not
be
forgotten
for
this
evening
he
is
going
to
render
us
a
great
the
young
king
looked
at
the
officer
with
his
eye
and
repeated
monsieur
d
that
is
it
my
the
young
king
slowly
raised
his
little
hand
and
held
it
out
to
the
musketeer
the
latter
bent
on
his
knee
and
kissed
it
monsieur
d
artagnan
repeated
louis
very
well
at
this
moment
they
were
startled
by
a
noise
as
if
a
tumult
were
approaching
what
is
that
exclaimed
the
queen
oh
oh
replied
d
artagnan
straining
both
at
the
same
time
his
quick
ear
and
his
intelligent
glance
it
is
the
murmur
of
the
populace
in
we
must
fly
said
the
queen
your
majesty
has
given
me
the
control
of
this
business
we
had
better
wait
and
see
what
they
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
will
answer
for
nothing
is
so
catching
as
confidence
the
queen
full
of
energy
and
courage
was
quickly
alive
to
these
two
virtues
in
others
do
as
you
like
she
said
i
rely
upon
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
give
orders
in
your
name
throughout
this
business
command
what
do
the
people
want
this
time
demanded
the
king
we
are
about
to
ascertain
sire
replied
d
artagnan
as
he
rapidly
left
the
room
the
tumult
continued
to
increase
and
seemed
to
surround
the
palais
royal
entirely
cries
were
heard
from
the
interior
of
which
they
could
not
comprehend
the
sense
it
was
evident
that
there
was
clamor
and
sedition
the
king
half
dressed
the
queen
and
laporte
remained
each
in
the
same
state
and
almost
in
the
same
place
where
they
were
listening
and
waiting
comminges
who
was
on
guard
that
night
at
the
palais
royal
ran
in
he
had
about
two
hundred
men
in
the
courtyards
and
stables
and
he
placed
them
at
the
queen
s
disposal
well
asked
anne
of
austria
when
d
artagnan
reappeared
what
does
it
mean
it
means
madame
that
the
report
has
spread
that
the
queen
has
left
the
palais
royal
carrying
off
the
king
and
the
people
ask
to
have
proof
to
the
contrary
or
threaten
to
demolish
the
palais
oh
this
time
it
is
too
much
exclaimed
the
queen
and
i
will
prove
to
them
i
have
not
d
artagnan
saw
from
the
expression
of
the
queen
s
face
that
she
was
about
to
issue
some
violent
command
he
approached
her
and
said
in
a
low
voice
has
your
majesty
still
confidence
in
me
this
voice
startled
her
yes
sir
she
replied
every
confidence
will
the
queen
deign
to
follow
my
advice
let
your
majesty
dismiss
de
comminges
and
desire
him
to
shut
himself
up
with
his
men
in
the
guardhouse
and
in
the
comminges
glanced
at
d
artagnan
with
the
envious
look
with
which
every
courtier
sees
a
new
favorite
spring
up
you
hear
comminges
said
the
queen
d
artagnan
went
up
to
him
with
his
usual
quickness
he
caught
the
anxious
glance
monsieur
de
comminges
he
said
pardon
me
we
both
are
servants
of
the
queen
are
we
not
it
is
my
turn
to
be
of
use
to
her
do
not
envy
me
this
comminges
bowed
and
left
come
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
i
have
got
one
more
and
now
said
the
queen
addressing
d
artagnan
what
is
to
be
done
for
you
hear
that
instead
of
becoming
calmer
the
noise
madame
said
d
artagnan
the
people
want
to
see
the
king
and
they
must
see
what
must
see
him
where
on
the
balcony
not
at
all
madame
but
here
sleeping
in
his
oh
your
majesty
exclaimed
laporte
monsieur
d
artagnan
is
the
queen
became
thoughtful
and
smiled
like
a
woman
to
whom
duplicity
is
no
stranger
without
doubt
she
murmured
monsieur
laporte
said
d
artagnan
go
and
announce
to
the
people
through
the
grating
that
they
are
going
to
be
satisfied
and
that
in
five
minutes
they
shall
not
only
see
the
king
but
they
shall
see
him
in
bed
add
that
the
king
sleeps
and
that
the
queen
begs
that
they
will
keep
silence
so
as
not
to
awaken
but
not
every
one
a
deputation
of
two
or
four
every
one
but
reflect
they
will
keep
us
here
till
it
shall
take
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
answer
for
everything
madame
believe
me
i
know
the
people
they
are
like
a
great
child
who
only
wants
humoring
before
the
sleeping
king
they
will
be
mute
gentle
and
timid
as
go
laporte
said
the
queen
the
young
king
approached
his
mother
and
said
why
do
as
these
people
ask
it
must
be
so
my
son
said
anne
of
austria
but
if
they
say
it
must
be
to
me
am
i
no
longer
king
the
queen
remained
silent
sire
said
d
artagnan
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
ask
you
a
question
louis
xiv
turned
around
astonished
that
any
one
should
dare
to
address
him
but
the
queen
pressed
the
child
s
hand
yes
he
said
does
your
majesty
remember
when
playing
in
the
park
of
fontainebleau
or
in
the
palace
courts
at
versailles
ever
to
have
seen
the
sky
grow
suddenly
dark
and
heard
the
sound
of
thunder
yes
well
then
this
noise
of
thunder
however
much
your
majesty
may
have
wished
to
continue
playing
has
said
go
in
sire
you
must
do
certainly
sir
but
they
tell
me
that
the
noise
of
thunder
is
the
voice
of
well
then
sire
continued
d
artagnan
listen
to
the
noise
of
the
people
you
will
perceive
that
it
resembles
that
of
in
truth
at
that
moment
a
terrible
murmur
was
wafted
to
them
by
the
night
breeze
then
all
at
once
it
ceased
hold
sire
said
d
artagnan
they
have
just
told
the
people
that
you
are
asleep
you
see
you
still
are
the
queen
looked
with
surprise
at
this
strange
man
whose
brilliant
courage
made
him
the
equal
of
the
bravest
and
who
was
by
his
fine
and
quick
intelligence
the
equal
of
the
most
astute
laporte
entered
well
laporte
asked
the
queen
madame
he
replied
monsieur
d
artagnan
s
prediction
has
been
accomplished
they
are
calm
as
if
by
enchantment
the
doors
are
about
to
be
opened
and
in
five
minutes
they
will
be
laporte
said
the
queen
suppose
you
put
one
of
your
sons
in
the
king
s
place
we
might
be
off
during
the
if
your
majesty
desires
it
said
laporte
my
sons
like
myself
are
at
the
queen
s
not
at
all
said
d
artagnan
should
one
of
them
know
his
majesty
and
discover
but
a
substitute
all
would
be
you
are
right
sir
always
right
said
anne
of
austria
laporte
place
the
king
in
laporte
placed
the
king
dressed
as
he
was
in
the
bed
and
then
covered
him
as
far
as
the
shoulders
with
the
sheet
the
queen
bent
over
him
and
kissed
his
brow
pretend
to
sleep
louis
said
she
yes
said
the
king
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
touched
by
any
of
those
sire
i
am
here
said
d
artagnan
and
i
give
you
my
word
that
if
a
single
man
has
the
audacity
his
life
shall
pay
for
and
now
what
is
to
be
done
asked
the
queen
for
i
hear
monsieur
laporte
go
to
them
and
again
recommend
silence
madame
wait
at
the
door
whilst
i
shall
be
at
the
head
of
the
king
s
bed
ready
to
die
for
laporte
went
out
the
queen
remained
standing
near
the
hangings
whilst
d
artagnan
glided
behind
the
curtains
then
the
heavy
and
collected
steps
of
a
multitude
of
men
were
heard
and
the
queen
herself
raised
the
tapestry
hangings
and
put
her
finger
on
her
lips
on
seeing
the
queen
the
men
stopped
short
respectfully
enter
gentlemen
enter
said
the
queen
there
was
then
amongst
that
crowd
a
moment
s
hesitation
which
looked
like
shame
they
had
expected
resistance
they
had
expected
to
be
thwarted
to
have
to
force
the
gates
to
overturn
the
guards
the
gates
had
opened
of
themselves
and
the
king
ostensibly
at
least
had
no
other
guard
at
his
but
his
mother
the
foremost
of
them
stammered
and
attempted
to
fall
back
enter
gentlemen
said
laporte
since
the
queen
desires
you
so
to
then
one
more
bold
than
the
rest
ventured
to
pass
the
door
and
to
advance
on
tiptoe
this
example
was
imitated
by
the
rest
until
the
room
filled
silently
as
if
these
men
had
been
the
humblest
most
devoted
courtiers
far
beyond
the
door
the
heads
of
those
who
were
not
able
to
enter
could
be
seen
all
craning
to
their
utmost
height
to
try
and
see
d
artagnan
saw
it
all
through
an
opening
he
had
made
in
the
curtain
and
in
the
very
first
man
who
entered
he
recognized
planchet
sir
said
the
queen
to
him
thinking
he
was
the
leader
of
the
band
you
wished
to
see
the
king
and
therefore
i
determined
to
show
him
to
you
myself
approach
and
look
at
him
and
say
if
we
have
the
appearance
of
people
who
wish
to
run
no
certainly
replied
planchet
rather
astonished
at
the
unexpected
honor
conferred
upon
him
you
will
say
then
to
my
good
and
faithful
parisians
continued
anne
with
a
smile
the
expression
of
which
did
not
deceive
d
artagnan
that
you
have
seen
the
king
in
bed
asleep
and
the
queen
also
ready
to
i
shall
tell
them
madame
and
those
who
accompany
me
will
say
the
same
thing
but
but
what
asked
anne
of
austria
will
your
majesty
pardon
me
said
planchet
but
is
it
really
the
king
who
is
lying
there
anne
of
austria
started
if
she
said
there
is
one
among
you
who
knows
the
king
let
him
approach
and
say
whether
it
is
really
his
majesty
lying
a
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
in
the
folds
of
which
his
face
was
hidden
approached
and
leaned
over
the
bed
and
looked
for
one
second
d
artagnan
thought
the
man
had
some
evil
design
and
he
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
but
in
the
movement
made
by
the
man
in
stooping
a
portion
of
his
face
was
uncovered
and
d
artagnan
recognized
the
coadjutor
it
is
certainly
the
king
said
the
man
rising
again
god
bless
his
majesty
yes
repeated
the
leader
in
a
whisper
god
bless
his
majesty
and
all
these
men
who
had
entered
enraged
passed
from
anger
to
pity
and
blessed
the
royal
infant
in
their
turn
now
said
planchet
let
us
thank
the
queen
my
friends
they
all
bowed
and
retired
by
degrees
as
noiselessly
as
they
had
entered
planchet
who
had
been
the
first
to
enter
was
the
last
to
leave
the
queen
stopped
him
what
is
your
name
my
friend
she
said
planchet
much
surprised
at
the
inquiry
turned
back
yes
continued
the
queen
i
think
myself
as
much
honored
to
have
received
you
this
evening
as
if
you
had
been
a
prince
and
i
wish
to
know
your
yes
thought
planchet
to
treat
me
as
a
prince
no
thank
d
artagnan
trembled
lest
planchet
seduced
like
the
crow
in
the
fable
should
tell
his
name
and
that
the
queen
knowing
his
name
would
discover
that
planchet
had
belonged
to
him
madame
replied
planchet
respectfully
i
am
called
dulaurier
at
your
thank
you
monsieur
dulaurier
said
the
queen
and
what
is
your
business
madame
i
am
a
clothier
in
the
rue
that
is
all
i
wished
to
know
said
the
queen
much
obliged
to
you
monsieur
dulaurier
you
will
hear
again
from
come
come
thought
d
artagnan
emerging
from
behind
the
curtain
decidedly
monsieur
planchet
is
no
fool
it
is
evident
he
has
been
brought
up
in
a
good
the
different
actors
in
this
strange
scene
remained
facing
one
another
without
uttering
a
single
word
the
queen
standing
near
the
door
d
artagnan
half
out
of
his
hiding
place
the
king
raised
on
his
elbow
ready
to
fall
down
on
his
bed
again
at
the
slightest
sound
that
would
indicate
the
return
of
the
multitude
but
instead
of
approaching
the
noise
became
more
and
more
distant
and
very
soon
it
died
entirely
away
the
queen
breathed
more
freely
d
artagnan
wiped
his
damp
forehead
and
the
king
slid
off
his
bed
saying
let
us
at
this
moment
laporte
reappeared
well
asked
the
queen
well
madame
replied
the
valet
i
followed
them
as
far
as
the
gates
they
announced
to
all
their
comrades
that
they
had
seen
the
king
and
that
the
queen
had
spoken
to
them
and
in
fact
they
went
away
quite
proud
and
oh
the
miserable
wretches
murmured
the
queen
they
shall
pay
dearly
for
their
boldness
and
it
is
i
who
promise
then
turning
to
d
artagnan
she
said

given
me
this
evening

best
advice

ever
received

the
private
stairs
and
you
will
find
me

and
the
musketeer
on
the
box

took
out
the
parcel
which
he
had
desired

to

under
the
seat
it
may
be
remembered
that
it
was
the

belonging
to
monsieur
de

he
placed
the
cloak
on
his
shoulders
and
the
hat
on
his
head
whilst
the
musketeer
got
off
the
box
sir

hotel
de
la

whence
you
will
take
my
horse
and
that
of
monsieur
du
vallon
which
you
must
saddle
and
equip
as
if
for
war
and
then
you
will
leave
paris
bringing
them
with
you
to
cours
la
reine
if
when
you
arrive
at
cours
la
reine
you
find
no
one
you
must
go
on
to
saint
germain
on
the
king
s
the
musketeer
touched
his
cap
and
went
away
to
execute
the
orders
thus
received
d

mounted
the
box
having
a
pair
of
pistols
in
his
belt
a
musket
under
his
feet
and
a
naked
sword
behind
him
the
queen
appeared
and
was
followed
by
the
king
and
the
duke
d
anjou
his
brother
monsieur
the
coadjutor
s
carriage
she
exclaimed
falling
back
yes
madame
said
d
artagnan
but
get
in
fearlessly
for
i
myself
will
drive
the
queen
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
entered
the
carriage
and
the
king
and
monsieur
took
their
places
at
her
side
come
laporte
said
the
queen
how
madame
said
the
valet
in
the
same
carriage
as
your
majesties
it
is
not
a
matter
of
royal
etiquette
this
evening
but
of
the
king
s
safety
get
in
laporte
obeyed
pull
down
the
blinds
said
d
artagnan
but
will
that
not
excite
suspicion
sir
asked
the
queen
your
majesty
s
mind
may
be
quite
at
ease
replied
the
officer
i
have
my
answer
the
blinds
were
pulled
down
and
they
started
at
a
gallop
by
the
rue
richelieu
on
reaching
the
gate
the
captain
of
the
post
advanced
at
the
head
of
a
dozen
men
holding
a
lantern
in
his
hand
d
artagnan
signed
to
them
to
draw
near
do
you
recognize
the
carriage
he
asked
the
sergeant
no
replied
the
latter
look
at
the
the
sergeant
put
the
lantern
near
the
panel
they
are
those
of
monsieur
le
coadjuteur
he
said
hush
he
is
enjoying
a
ride
with
madame
de
the
sergeant
began
to
laugh
open
the
gate
he
cried
i
know
who
it
is
then
putting
his
face
to
the
lowered
blinds
he
said
i
wish
you
joy
my
lord
impudent
fellow
cried
d
artagnan
you
will
get
me
turned
the
gate
groaned
on
its
hinges
and
d
artagnan
seeing
the
way
clear
whipped
his
horses
who
started
at
a
canter
and
five
minutes
later
they
had
rejoined
the
cardinal
mousqueton
exclaimed
d
artagnan
draw
up
the
blinds
of
his
majesty
s
it
is
he
cried
porthos
disguised
as
a
coachman
exclaimed
mazarin
and
driving
the
coadjutor
s
carriage
said
the
queen
corpo
di
dio
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
mazarin
you
are
worth
your
weight
in
how
d
artagnan
and
porthos
earned
by
selling
straw
mazarin
was
desirous
of
setting
out
instantly
for
saint
germain
but
the
queen
declared
that
she
should
wait
for
the
people
whom
she
had
appointed
to
meet
her
however
she
offered
the
cardinal
laporte
s
place
which
he
accepted
and
went
from
one
carriage
to
the
other
it
was
not
without
foundation
that
a
report
of
the
king
s
intention
to
leave
paris
by
night
had
been
circulated
ten
or
twelve
persons
had
been
in
the
secret
since
six
o
clock
and
howsoever
great
their
prudence
might
be
they
could
not
issue
the
necessary
orders
for
the
departure
without
suspicion
being
generated
besides
each
individual
had
one
or
two
others
for
whom
he
was
interested
and
as
there
could
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
queen
was
leaving
paris
full
of
terrible
projects
of
vengeance
every
one
had
warned
parents
and
friends
of
what
was
about
to
transpire
so
that
the
news
of
the
approaching
exit
ran
like
a
train
of
lighted
gunpowder
along
the
streets
the
first
carriage
which
arrived
after
that
of
the
queen
was
that
of
the
prince
de
conde
with
the
princess
and
dowager
princess
both
these
ladies
had
been
awakened
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
did
not
know
what
it
all
was
about
the
second
contained
the
duke
and
duchess
of
orleans
the
tall
young
mademoiselle
and
the
abbe
de
la
riviere
and
the
third
the
duke
de
longueville
and
the
prince
de
conti
brother
and
of
conde
they
all
alighted
and
hastened
to
pay
their
respects
to
the
king
and
queen
in
their
coach
the
queen
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
carriage
they
had
left
and
seeing
that
it
was
empty
she
said
but
where
is
madame
de
longueville
ah
yes
where
is
my
sister
asked
the
prince
madame
de
longueville
is
ill
said
the
duke
and
she
desired
me
to
excuse
her
to
your
anne
gave
a
quick
glance
to
mazarin
who
answered
by
an
almost
imperceptible
shake
of
his
head
what
do
you
say
of
this
asked
the
queen
i
say
that
she
is
a
hostage
for
the
parisians
answered
the
cardinal
why
is
she
not
come
asked
the
prince
in
a
low
voice
addressing
his
brother
silence
whispered
the
duke
she
has
her
she
will
ruin
us
returned
the
prince
she
will
save
us
said
conti
carriages
now
arrived
in
crowds
those
of
the
marechal
de
villeroy
guitant
villequier
and
comminges
came
into
the
line
the
two
musketeers
arrived
in
their
turn
holding
the
horses
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
in
their
hands
these
two
instantly
mounted
the
coachman
of
the
latter
replacing
d
artagnan
on
the
of
the
royal
coach
mousqueton
took
the
place
of
the
coachman
and
drove
standing
for
reasons
known
to
himself
like
automedon
of
antiquity
the
queen
though
occupied
by
a
thousand
details
tried
to
catch
the
gascon
s
eye
but
he
with
his
wonted
prudence
had
mingled
with
the
crowd
let
us
be
the
avant
guard
said
he
to
porthos
and
find
good
quarters
at
saint
germain
nobody
will
think
of
us
and
for
my
part
i
am
greatly
as
for
me
replied
porthos
i
am
falling
asleep
which
is
strange
considering
we
have
not
had
any
fighting
truly
the
parisians
are
or
rather
we
are
very
clever
said
d
artagnan
and
how
is
your
wrist
better
but
do
you
think
that
we
ve
got
them
this
time
got
what
you
your
command
and
i
my
title
i
faith
yes
i
should
expect
so
besides
if
they
forget
i
shall
take
the
liberty
of
reminding
the
queen
s
voice
she
is
speaking
said
porthos
i
think
she
wants
to
ride
on
oh
she
would
like
it
but
but
what
the
cardinal
won
t
allow
it
gentlemen
he
said
addressing
the
two
musketeers
accompany
the
royal
carriage
we
are
going
forward
to
look
for
d
artagnan
started
off
for
saint
germain
followed
by
porthos
we
will
go
on
gentlemen
said
the
queen
and
the
royal
carriage
drove
on
followed
by
the
other
coaches
and
about
fifty
horsemen
they
reached
saint
german
without
any
accident
on
descending
the
queen
found
the
prince
awaiting
her
to
offer
her
his
hand
what
an
awakening
for
the
parisians
said
the
queen
radiant
it
is
war
said
the
prince
well
then
let
it
be
war
have
we
not
on
our
side
the
conqueror
of
rocroy
of
nordlingen
of
lens
the
prince
bowed
low
it
was
then
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
queen
walked
first
every
one
followed
her
about
two
hundred
persons
had
accompanied
her
in
her
flight
gentlemen
said
the
queen
laughing
pray
take
up
your
abode
in
the
chateau
it
is
large
and
there
will
be
no
want
of
room
for
you
all
but
as
we
never
thought
of
coming
here
i
am
informed
that
there
are
in
all
only
three
beds
in
the
whole
establishment
one
for
the
king
one
for
me
and
one
for
the
cardinal
muttered
the
prince
am
i
am
i
then
to
sleep
on
the
floor
asked
gaston
d
orleans
with
a
forced
smile
no
my
prince
replied
mazarin
the
third
bed
is
intended
for
your
but
your
eminence
replied
the
prince
i
answered
mazarin
i
shall
not
sleep
at
all
i
have
work
to
gaston
desired
that
he
should
be
shown
into
the
room
wherein
he
was
to
sleep
without
in
the
least
concerning
himself
as
to
where
his
wife
and
daughter
were
to
repose
well
for
my
part
i
shall
go
to
bed
said
d
artagnan
come
porthos
followed
the
lieutenant
with
that
profound
confidence
he
ever
had
in
the
wisdom
of
his
friend
they
walked
from
one
end
of
the
chateau
to
the
other
porthos
looking
with
wondering
eyes
at
d
artagnan
who
was
counting
on
his
fingers
four
hundred
at
a
pistole
each
four
hundred
yes
interposed
porthos
four
hundred
pistoles
but
who
is
to
make
four
hundred
pistoles
a
pistole
is
not
enough
said
d
artagnan
tis
worth
a
what
is
worth
a
louis
four
hundred
at
a
louis
each
make
four
hundred
four
hundred
said
porthos
yes
there
are
two
hundred
of
them
and
each
of
them
will
need
two
which
will
make
four
but
four
hundred
what
listen
cried
d
artagnan
but
as
there
were
all
kinds
of
people
about
who
were
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
at
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
court
he
whispered
in
his
friend
s
ear
i
understand
answered
porthos
i
understand
you
perfectly
on
my
honor
two
hundred
louis
each
of
us
would
be
making
a
pretty
thing
of
it
but
what
will
people
say
let
them
say
what
they
will
besides
how
will
they
know
that
we
are
doing
it
but
who
will
distribute
these
things
asked
porthos
isn
t
mousqueton
there
but
he
wears
my
livery
my
livery
will
be
known
replied
porthos
he
can
turn
his
coat
inside
you
are
always
in
the
right
my
dear
friend
cried
porthos
but
where
the
devil
do
you
discover
all
the
notions
you
put
into
practice
d
artagnan
smiled
the
two
friends
turned
down
the
first
street
they
came
to
porthos
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
house
to
the
right
whilst
d
artagnan
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
house
to
the
left
some
straw
they
said
sir
we
don
t
keep
any
was
the
reply
of
the
people
who
opened
the
doors
but
please
ask
at
the
hay
dealer
where
is
the
hay
dealer
s
at
the
last
large
door
in
the
are
there
any
other
people
in
saint
germain
who
sell
straw
yes
there
s
the
landlord
of
the
lamb
and
the
farmer
they
both
live
in
the
rue
des
very
d
artagnan
went
instantly
to
the
hay
dealer
and
bargained
with
him
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
trusses
of
straw
which
he
obtained
at
the
rate
of
three
pistoles
each
he
went
afterward
to
the
innkeeper
and
bought
from
him
two
hundred
trusses
at
the
same
price
finally
farmer
louis
sold
them
eighty
trusses
making
in
all
four
hundred
and
thirty
there
was
no
more
to
be
had
in
saint
germain
this
foraging
did
not
occupy
more
than
half
an
hour
mousqueton
duly
instructed
was
put
at
the
head
of
this
sudden
and
new
business
he
was
cautioned
not
to
let
a
bit
of
straw
out
of
his
hands
under
a
louis
the
truss
and
they
intrusted
to
him
straw
to
the
amount
of
four
hundred
and
thirty
louis
d
artagnan
taking
with
him
three
trusses
of
straw
returned
to
the
chateau
where
everybody
freezing
with
cold
and
more
than
half
asleep
envied
the
king
the
queen
and
the
duke
of
orleans
on
their
camp
beds
the
lieutenant
s
entrance
produced
a
burst
of
laughter
in
the
great
but
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
that
he
was
the
object
of
general
attention
but
began
to
arrange
with
so
much
cleverness
nicety
and
gayety
his
straw
bed
that
the
mouths
of
all
these
poor
creatures
who
could
not
go
to
sleep
began
to
water
straw
they
all
cried
out
straw
where
is
there
any
to
be
found
i
can
show
you
answered
the
gascon
and
he
conducted
them
to
mousqueton
who
freely
distributed
the
trusses
at
the
rate
of
a
louis
apiece
it
was
thought
rather
dear
but
people
wanted
to
sleep
and
who
would
not
give
even
two
or
three
louis
for
a
few
hours
of
sound
sleep
d
artagnan
gave
up
his
bed
to
any
one
who
wanted
it
making
it
over
about
a
dozen
times
and
since
he
was
supposed
to
have
paid
like
the
others
a
louis
for
his
truss
of
straw
he
pocketed
in
that
way
thirty
louis
in
less
than
half
an
hour
at
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
straw
was
worth
eighty
francs
a
truss
and
there
was
no
more
to
be
had
d
artagnan
had
taken
the
precaution
to
set
apart
four
trusses
for
his
own
use
he
put
in
his
pocket
the
key
of
the
room
where
he
had
hidden
them
and
accompanied
by
porthos
returned
to
settle
with
mousqueton
who
naively
and
like
the
worthy
steward
that
he
was
handed
them
four
hundred
and
thirty
louis
and
kept
one
hundred
for
himself
mousqueton
who
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
the
chateau
wondered
that
the
idea
had
not
occurred
to
him
sooner
d
artagnan
put
the
gold
in
his
hat
and
in
going
back
to
the
chateau
settled
the
reckoning
with
porthos
each
of
them
had
cleared
two
hundred
and
fifteen
louis
porthos
however
found
that
he
had
no
straw
left
for
himself
he
returned
to
mousqueton
but
the
steward
had
sold
the
last
wisp
he
then
repaired
to
d
artagnan
who
thanks
to
his
four
trusses
of
straw
was
in
the
act
of
making
up
and
tasting
by
anticipation
the
luxury
of
a
bed
so
soft
so
well
stuffed
at
the
head
so
well
covered
at
the
foot
that
it
would
have
excited
the
envy
of
the
king
himself
if
his
majesty
had
not
been
fast
asleep
in
his
own
d
artagnan
could
on
no
account
consent
to
pull
his
bed
to
pieces
again
for
porthos
but
for
a
consideration
of
four
louis
that
the
latter
paid
him
for
it
he
consented
that
porthos
should
share
his
couch
with
him
he
laid
his
sword
at
the
head
his
pistols
by
his
side
stretched
his
cloak
over
his
feet
placed
his
felt
hat
on
the
top
of
his
cloak
and
extended
himself
luxuriously
on
the
straw
which
rustled
under
him
he
was
already
enjoying
the
sweet
dream
engendered
by
the
possession
of
two
hundred
and
nineteen
louis
made
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
a
voice
was
heard
at
the
door
of
the
hall
which
made
him
stir
monsieur
d
artagnan
it
cried
here
cried
porthos
here
porthos
foresaw
that
if
d
artagnan
was
called
away
he
should
remain
the
sole
possessor
of
the
bed
an
officer
approached
i
am
come
to
fetch
you
monsieur
d
from
whom
his
eminence
sent
tell
my
lord
that
i
m
going
to
sleep
and
i
advise
him
as
a
friend
to
do
the
his
eminence

not
gone
to
bed
and
will
not
go
to
bed
and
wants
you
the
devil
take
mazarin
who
does
not
know
when
to
sleep
at
the
proper
time
what
does
he
want
with
me
is
it
to
make
me
a
captain
in
that
case
i
will
forgive
and
the
musketeer
rose
grumbling
took
his
sword
hat
pistols
and
cloak
and
followed
the
officer
whilst
porthos
alone
and
sole
possessor
of
the
bed
endeavored
to
follow
the
good
example
of
falling
asleep
which
his
predecessor
had
set
him
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
cardinal
on
perceiving
him
i
have
not
forgotten
with
what
zeal
you
have
served
me
i
am
going
to
prove
to
you
that
i
have
good
thought
the
gascon

is
a
promising
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
resumed

wish
to
become
a
captain
yes
my
and
your
friend
still
longs
to
be
made
a
baron
at
this
very
moment
my
lord
he
no
doubt
dreams
that
he
is
one
then
said
mazarin
taking
from
his
portfolio
the
letter
which
he
had
already
shown
d
artagnan
take
this
dispatch
and
carry
it
to

artagnan
looked
at
the
envelope
there
was
no
address

not
to
know
to
whom
to
present
it
you

lord
and
what
am
i
to
do
with
this
young
gentleman

wherever
he
leads
d
artagnan
looked
at
the
cardinal
with
a
stupefied
air
there
are
your
instructions
said
mazarin
go
go
tis
easy
to
say
so
but
that
requires
money
and
i
haven
t
ah
replied
mazarin
so
you
have
no
money
none
my
but
the
diamond
i
gave
you
yesterday
i
wish
to
keep
it
in
remembrance
of
your
mazarin
sighed
tis
very
dear
living
in
england
my
lord
especially
as
envoy
zounds
replied
mazarin
the
people
there
are
very
sedate
and
their
habits
since
the
revolution
simple
but
no
he
opened
a
drawer
and
took
out
a
purse
what
do
you
say
to
a
thousand
crowns
d
artagnan
pouted
out
his
lower
lip
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
i
reply
my
lord
tis
but
little
as
certainly
i
shall
not
go
i
suppose
not
monsieur
du
vallon
that
worthy
gentleman
for
with
the
exception
of
yourself
monsieur
d
artagnan
there
s
not
a
man
in
france
that
i
esteem
and
love
so
much
as
him
then
my
lord
replied
d
artagnan
pointing
to
the
purse
which
mazarin
still
held
if
you
love
and
esteem
him
so
much
you
understand
me
be
it
so
on
his
account
i
add
two
hundred
scoundrel
muttered
d
artagnan
but
on
our
return
he
said
aloud
may
we
that
is
my
friend
and
i
depend
on
having
he
his
barony
and
i
my
promotion
on
the
honor
of
i
should
like
another
sort
of
oath
better
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
then
aloud
may
i
not
offer
my
duty
to
her
majesty
the
queen
her
majesty
is
asleep
and
you
must
set
off
directly
replied
mazarin
go
pray
sir
one
word
more
my
lord
if
there
s
any
fighting
where
i
m
going
must
i
fight
you
are
to
obey
the
commands
of
the
personage
to
whom
i
have
addressed
the
inclosed
tis
well
said
d
artagnan
holding
out
his
hand
to
receive
the
money
i
offer
my
best
respects
and
services
to
you
my
d
artagnan
then
returning
to
the
officer
said
sir
have
the
kindness
also
to
awaken
monsieur
du
vallon
and
to
say
tis
by
his
eminence
s
order
and
that
i
shall
await
him
at
the
the
officer
went
off
with
an
eagerness
that
showed
the
gascon
that
he
had
some
personal
interest
in
the
matter
porthos
was
snoring
most
musically
when
some
one
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
i
come
from
the
cardinal
said
the
officer
heigho
said
porthos
opening
his
large
eyes
what
have
you
got
to
say
that
his
eminence
has
ordered
you
to
england
and
that
monsieur
d
artagnan
is
waiting
for
you
in
the
porthos
sighed
heavily
arose
took
his
hat
his
pistols
and
his
cloak
and
departed
casting
a
look
of
regret
upon
the
couch
where
he
had
hoped
to
sleep
so
well
no
sooner
had
he
turned
his
back
than
the
officer
laid
himself
down
in
it
and
he
had
scarcely
crossed
the
threshold
before
his
successor
in
his
turn
was
snoring
immoderately
it
was
very
natural
he
being
the
only
person
in
the
whole
assemblage
except
the
king
the
queen
and
the
duke
of
orleans
who
slept
gratuitously
in
which
we
hear
tidings
of
aramis
d
artagnan
went
straight
to
the
stables
day
was
just
dawning
he
found
his
horse
and
that
of
porthos
fastened
to
the
manger
but
to
an
empty
manger
he
took
pity
on
these
poor
animals
and
went
to
a
corner
of
the
stable
where
he
saw
a
little
straw
but
in
doing
so
he
struck
his
foot
against
a
human
body
which
uttered
a
cry
and
arose
on
its
knees
rubbing
its
eyes
it
was
mousqueton
who
having
no
straw
to
lie
upon
had
helped
himself
to
that
of
the
horses
mousqueton
cried
d
artagnan
let
us
be
off
let
us
set
mousqueton
recognizing
the
voice
of
his
master
s
friend
got
up
suddenly
and
in
doing
so
let
fall
some
louis
which
he
had
appropriated
to
himself
illegally
during
the
night
ho
ho
exclaimed
d
artagnan
picking
up
a
louis
and
displaying
it
here
s
a
louis
that
smells
confoundedly
of
mousqueton
blushed
so
confusedly
that
the
gascon
began
to
laugh
at
him
and
said
porthos
would
be
angry
my
dear
monsieur
mousqueton
but
i
pardon
you
only
let
us
remember
that
this
gold
must
serve
us
as
a
joke
so
be
gay
come
mousqueton
instantly
assumed
a
jovial
countenance
saddled
the
horses
quickly
and
mounted
his
own
without
making
faces
over
it
whilst
this
went
on
porthos
arrived
with
a
very
cross
look
on
his
face
and
was
astonished
to
find
the
lieutenant
resigned
and
mousqueton
almost
merry
ah
that
s
it
he
cried
you
have
your
promotion
and
i
my
we
are
going
to
fetch
our
brevets
said
d
artagnan
and
when
we
come
back
master
mazarin
will
sign
and
where
are
we
going
asked
porthos
to
paris
first
i
have
affairs
to
and
they
both
set
out
for
paris
on
arriving
at
its
gates
they
were
astounded
to
see
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
capital
around
a
carriage
the
people
were
uttering
imprecations
whilst
the
persons
who
had
attempted
to
escape
were
made
prisoners
that
is
to
say
an
old
man
and
two
women
on
the
other
hand
as
the
two
friends
approached
to
enter
they
showed
them
every
kind
of
civility
thinking
them
deserters
from
the
royal
party
and
wishing
to
bind
them
to
their
own
what
is
the
king
doing
they
asked
he
is
and
the
spanish
woman
and
the
cursed
italian
he
is
awake
so
keep
on
the
watch
as
they
are
gone
away
it
s
for
some
purpose
rely
on
it
but
as
you
are
the
strongest
after
all
continued
d
artagnan
don
t
be
furious
with
old
men
and
women
and
keep
your
wrath
for
more
appropriate
the
people
listened
to
these
words
and
let
go
the
ladies
who
thanked
d
artagnan
with
an
eloquent
look
now
onward
cried
the
gascon
and
they
continued
their
way
crossing
the
barricades
getting
the
chains
about
their
legs
pushed
about
questioning
and
questioned
in
the
place
of
the
palais
royal
d
artagnan
saw
a
sergeant
who
was
drilling
six
or
seven
hundred
citizens
it
was
planchet
who
brought
into
play
profitably
the
recollections
of
the
regiment
of
piedmont
in
passing
before
d
artagnan
he
recognized
his
former
master
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
planchet
proudly
monsieur
dulaurier
replied
d
artagnan
planchet
stopped
short
staring
at
d
artagnan
the
first
row
seeing
their
sergeant
stop
stopped
in
their
turn
and
so
on
to
the
very
last
these
citizens
are
dreadfully
ridiculous
observed
d
artagnan
to
porthos
and
went
on
his
way
five
minutes
afterward
he
entered
the
hotel
of
la
chevrette
where
pretty
madeleine
the
hostess
came
to
him
my
dear
mistress
turquaine
said
the
gascon
if
you
happen
to
have
any
money
lock
it
up
quickly
if
you
happen
to
have
any
jewels
hide
them
directly
if
you
happen
to
have
any
debtors
make
them
pay
you
or
any
creditors
don
t
pay
why
prithee
asked
madeleine
because
paris
is
going
to
be
reduced
to
dust
and
ashes
like
babylon
of
which
you
have
no
doubt
heard
and
are
you
going
to
leave
me
at
such
a
time
this
very
and
where
are
you
going
ah
if
you
could
tell
me
that
you
would
be
doing
me
a
ah
me
ah
me
have
you
any
letters
for
me
inquired
d
artagnan
wishing
to
signify
to
the
hostess
that
her
lamentations
were
superfluous
and
that
therefore
she
had
better
spare
him
demonstrations
of
her
grief
there
s
one
just
arrived
and
she
handed
the
letter
to
d
artagnan
from
athos
cried
d
artagnan
recognizing
the
handwriting
ah
said
porthos
let
us
hear
what
he
d
artagnan
opened
the
letter
and
read
as
follows
dear
d
artagnan
dear
du
vallon
my
good
friends
perhaps
this
may
be
the
last
time
that
you
will
ever
hear
from
me
aramis
and
i
are
very
unhappy
but
god
our
courage
and
the
remembrance
of
our
friendship
sustain
us
think
often
of
raoul
i
intrust
to
you
certain
papers
which
are
at
blois
and
in
two
months
and
a
half
if
you
do
not
hear
of
us
take
possession
of
them
embrace
with
all
your
heart
the
vicomte
for
your
devoted
friend
i
believe
by
heaven
said
d
artagnan
that
i
shall
embrace
him
since
he
s
upon
our
road
and
if
he
is
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
our
dear
athos
from
that
very
day
he
becomes
my
and
i
said
porthos
shall
make
him
my
sole
let
us
see
what
more
does
athos
say
should
you
meet
on
your
journey
a
certain
monsieur
mordaunt
distrust
him
in
a
letter
i
can
not
say
monsieur
mordaunt
exclaimed
the
gascon
surprised
monsieur
mordaunt
tis
well
said
porthos
we
shall
remember
that
but
see
there
is
a
postscript
from
so
there
is
said
d
artagnan
and
he
read
we
conceal
the
place
where
we
are
dear
friends
knowing
your
brotherly
affection
and
that
you
would
come
and
die
with
us
were
we
to
reveal
confound
it
interrupted
porthos
with
an
explosion
of
passion
which
sent
mousqueton
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
are
they
in
danger
of
dying
d
artagnan
continued
athos
bequeaths
to
you
raoul
and
i
bequeath
to
you
my
revenge
if
by
any
good
luck
you
lay
your
hand
on
a
certain
man
named
mordaunt
tell
porthos
to
take
him
into
a
corner
and
to
wring
his
neck
i
dare
not
say
more
in
a
letter
if
that
is
all
it
is
easily
done
said
porthos
on
the
contrary
observed
d
artagnan
with
a
vexed
look
it
would
be
how
so
it
is
precisely
this
monsieur
mordaunt
whom
we
are
going
to
join
at
boulogne
and
with
whom
we
cross
to
well
suppose
instead
of
joining
this
monsieur
mordaunt
we
were
to
go
and
join
our
friends
said
porthos
with
a
gesture
fierce
enough
to
have
frightened
an
army
i
did
think
of
it
but
this
letter
has
neither
date
nor
true
said
porthos
and
he
began
to
wander
about
the
room
like
a
man
beside
himself
gesticulating
and
half
drawing
his
sword
out
of
the
scabbard
as
to
d
artagnan
he
remained
standing
like
a
man
in
consternation
with
the
deepest
affliction
depicted
on
his
face
ah
this
is
not
right
athos
insults
us
he
wishes
to
die
alone
it
is
bad
bad
mousqueton
witnessing
this
despair
melted
into
tears
in
a
corner
of
the
room
come
said
d
artagnan
all
this
leads
to
nothing
let
us
go
on
we
will
embrace
raoul
and
perhaps
he
will
have
news
of
stop
an
idea
cried
porthos
indeed
my
dear
d
artagnan
i
don
t
know
how
you
manage
but
you
are
always
full
of
ideas
let
us
go
and
embrace
woe
to
that
man
who
should
happen
to
contradict
my
master
at
this
moment
said
mousqueton
to
himself
i
wouldn
t
give
a
farthing
for
his
they
set
out
on
arriving
at
the
rue
saint
denis
the
friends
found
a
vast
concourse
of
people
it
was
the
duc
de
beaufort
who
was
coming
from
the
vendomois
and
whom
the
coadjutor
was
showing
to
the
parisians
intoxicated
with
joy
with
the
duke
s
aid
they
already
considered
themselves
invincible
the
two
friends
turned
off
into
a
side
street
to
avoid
meeting
the
prince
and
so
reached
the
saint
denis
gate
is
it
true
said
the
guard
to
the
two
cavaliers
that
the
duc
de
beaufort
has
arrived
in
paris
nothing
more
certain
and
the
best
proof
of
it
is
said
d
artagnan
that
he
has
dispatched
us
to
meet
the
duc
de
vendome
his
father
who
is
coming
in
his
long
live
de
beaufort
cried
the
guards
and
they
drew
back
respectfully
to
let
the
two
friends
pass
once
across
the
barriers
these
two
knew
neither
fatigue
nor
fear
their
horses
flew
and
they
never
ceased
speaking
of
athos
and
aramis
the
camp
had
entered
saint
omer
the
friends
made
a
little
detour
and
went
to
the
camp
and
gave
the
army
an
exact
account
of
the
flight
of
the
king
and
queen
they
found
raoul
near
his
tent
reclining
on
a
truss
of
hay
of
which
his
horse
stole
some
mouthfuls
the
young
man
s
eyes
were
red
and
he
seemed
dejected
the
marechal
de
grammont
and
the
comte
de
guiche
had
returned
to
paris
and
he
was
quite
lonely
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
two
cavaliers
he
ran
to
them
with
open
arms
oh
is
it
you
dear
friends
did
you
come
here
to
fetch
me
will
you
take
me
away
with
you
do
you
bring
me
tidings
of
my
guardian
have
you
not
received
any
said
d
artagnan
to
the
youth
alas
sir
no
and
i
do
not
know
what
has
become
of
him
so
that
i
am
really
so
unhappy
that
i
in
fact
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
porthos
turned
aside
in
order
not
to
show
by
his
honest
round
face
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
deuce
take
it
cried
d
artagnan
more
moved
than
he
had
been
for
a
long
time
don
t
despair
my
friend
if
you
have
not
received
any
letters
from
the
count
we
have
received
oh
really
cried
raoul
and
a
comforting
one
too
added
d
artagnan
seeing
the
delight
that
his
intelligence
gave
the
young
man
have
you
it
asked
raoul
yes
that
is
i
had
it
repined
the
gascon
making
believe
to
find
it
wait
it
ought
to
be
there
in
my
pocket
it
speaks
of
his
return
does
it
not
porthos
all
gascon
as
he
was
d
artagnan
could
not
bear
alone
the
weight
of
that
falsehood
yes
replied
porthos
coughing
eh
give
it
to
me
said
the
young
man
eh
i
read
it
a
little
while
since
can
i
have
lost
it
ah
confound
it
yes
my
pocket
has
a
hole
in
oh
yes
monsieur
raoul
said
mousqueton
the
letter
was
very
consoling
these
gentlemen
read
it
to
me
and
i
wept
for
but
at
any
rate
you
know
where
he
is
monsieur
d
artagnan
asked
raoul
somewhat
comforted
ah
that
s
the
thing
replied
the
gascon
undoubtedly
i
know
it
but
it
is
a
not
to
me
i
hope
no
not
to
you
so
i
am
going
to
tell
you
where
he
porthos
devoured
d
artagnan
with
wondering
eyes
where
the
devil
shall
i
say
that
he
is
so
that
he
can
not
try
to
rejoin
him
thought
d
artagnan
well
where
is
he
sir
asked
raoul
in
a
soft
and
coaxing
voice
he
is
at
among
the
turks
exclaimed
raoul
alarmed
good
heavens
how
can
you
tell
me
that
does
that
alarm
you
cried
d
artagnan
pooh
what
are
the
turks
to
such
men
as
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
abbe
d
herblay
ah
his
friend
is
with
him
said
raoul
that
comforts
me
a
has
he
wit
or
not
this
demon
d
artagnan
said
porthos
astonished
at
his
friend
s
deception
now
sir
said
d
artagnan
wishing
to
change
the
conversation
here
are
fifty
pistoles
that
the
count
has
sent
you
by
the
same
courier
i
suppose
you
have
no
more
money
and
that
they
will
be
i
have
still
twenty
pistoles
well
take
them
that
makes
and
if
you
wish
for
more
said
porthos
putting
his
hand
to
his
pocket
thank
you
sir
replied
raoul
blushing
thank
you
a
thousand
at
this
moment
olivain
appeared
apropos
said
d
artagnan
loud
enough
for
the
servant
to
hear
him
are
you
satisfied
with
olivain
yes
in
some
respects
tolerably
olivain
pretended
to
have
heard
nothing
and
entered
the
tent
what
fault
do
you
find
with
the
fellow
he
is
a
oh
sir
cried
olivain
reappearing
at
this
accusation
and
a
little
bit
of
a
oh
sir
oh
and
more
especially
a
notorious
oh
oh
sir
you
really
vilify
me
cried
olivain
the
deuce
cried
d
artagnan
pray
learn
monsieur
olivain
that
people
like
us
are
not
to
be
served
by
cowards
rob
your
master
eat
his
sweetmeats
and
drink
his
wine
but
by
jove
don
t
be
a
coward
or
i
shall
cut
off
your
ears
look
at
monsieur
mouston
see
the
honorable
wounds
he
has
received
observe
how
his
habitual
valor
has
given
dignity
to
his
mousqueton
was
in
the
third
heaven
and
would
have
embraced
d
artagnan
had
he
dared
meanwhile
he
resolved
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
him
on
the
next
occasion
that
presented
itself
send
away
that
fellow
raoul
said
the
gascon
for
if
he
s
a
coward
he
will
disgrace
thee
some
monsieur
says
i
am
coward
cried
olivain
because
he
wanted
the
other
day
to
fight
a
cornet
in
grammont
s
regiment
and
i
refused
to
accompany
monsieur
olivain
a
lackey
ought
never
to
disobey
said
d
artagnan
sternly
then
taking
him
aside
he
whispered
to
him
thou
hast
done
right
thy
master
was
in
the
wrong
here
s
a
crown
for
thee
but
should
he
ever
be
insulted
and
thou
dost
not
let
thyself
be
cut
in
quarters
for
him
i
will
cut
out
thy
tongue
remember
olivain
bowed
and
slipped
the
crown
into
his
pocket
and
now
raoul
said
the
gascon
monsieur
du
vallon
and
i
are
going
away
as
ambassadors
where
i
know
not
but
should
you
want
anything
write
to
madame
turquaine
at
la
chevrette
rue
tiquetonne
and
draw
upon
her
purse
as
on
a
banker
with
economy
for
it
is
not
so
well
filled
as
that
of
monsieur
d
and
having
meantime
embraced
his
ward
he
passed
him
into
the
robust
arms
of
porthos
who
lifted
him
up
from
the
ground
and
held
him
a
moment
suspended
near
the
noble
heart
of
the
formidable
giant
come
said
d
artagnan
let
us
and
they
set
out
for
boulogne
where
toward
evening
they
arrived
their
horses
flecked
with
foam
and
dark
with
perspiration
at
ten
steps
from
the
place
where
they
halted
was
a
young
man
in
black
who
seemed
waiting
for
some
one
and
who
from
the
moment
he
saw
them
enter
the
town
never
took
his
eyes
off
them
d
artagnan
approached
him
and
seeing
him
stare
so
fixedly
said
well
friend
i
don
t
like
people
to
quiz
me
sir
said
the
young
man
do
you
not
come
from
paris
if
you
please
d
artagnan
thought
it
was
some
gossip
who
wanted
news
from
the
capital
yes
sir
he
said
in
a
softened
tone
are
you
not
going
to
put
up
at
the
arms
of
england
yes
are
you
not
charged
with
a
mission
from
his
eminence
cardinal
mazarin
yes
in
that
case
i
am
the
man
you
have
to
do
with
i
am
ah
thought
d
artagnan
the
man
i
am
warned
against
by
ah
thought
porthos
the
man
aramis
wants
me
to
they
both
looked
searchingly
at
the
young
man
who
misunderstood
the
meaning
of
that
inquisition
do
you
doubt
my
word
he
said
in
that
case
i
can
give
you
no
sir
said
d
artagnan
and
we
place
ourselves
at
your
well
gentlemen
resumed
mordaunt
we
must
set
out
without
delay
is
the
last
day
granted
me
by
the
cardinal
my
ship
is
ready
and
had
you
not
come
i
must
have
set
off
without
you
for
general
cromwell
expects
my
return
so
thought
the
lieutenant
tis
to
general
cromwell
that
our
dispatches
are
have
you
no
letter
for
him
asked
the
young
man
i
have
one
the
seal
of
which
i
am
not
to
break
till
i
reach
london
but
since
you
tell
me
to
whom
it
is
addressed
tis
useless
to
wait
till
d
artagnan
tore
open
the
envelope
of
the
letter
it
was
directed
to
monsieur
oliver
cromwell
general
of
the
army
of
the
english
ah
said
d
artagnan
a
singular
who
is
this
monsieur
oliver
cromwell
inquired
porthos
formerly
a
brewer
replied
the
gascon
perhaps
mazarin
wishes
to
make
a
speculation
in
beer
as
we
did
in
straw
said
porthos
come
come
gentlemen
said
mordaunt
impatiently
let
us
what
exclaimed
porthos
without
supper
can
not
monsieur
cromwell
wait
a
little
yes
but
i
said
mordaunt
well
you
said
porthos
what
then
i
can
not
oh
as
to
you
that
is
not
my
concern
and
i
shall
sup
either
with
or
without
your
the
young
man
s
eyes
kindled
in
secret
but
he
restrained
himself
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
you
must
excuse
famished
travelers
besides
our
supper
can
t
delay
you
much
we
will
hasten
on
to
the
inn
you
will
meanwhile
proceed
on
foot
to
the
harbor
we
will
take
a
bite
and
shall
be
there
as
soon
as
you
just
as
you
please
gentlemen
provided
we
set
sail
he
said
the
name
of
your
ship
inquired
d
artagnan
the
very
well
in
half
an
hour
we
shall
be
on
and
the
friends
spurring
on
their
horses
rode
to
the
hotel
the
arms
of
what
do
you
say
of
that
young
man
asked
d
artagnan
as
they
hurried
along
i
say
that
he
doesn
t
suit
me
at
all
said
porthos
and
that
i
feel
a
strong
itching
to
follow
aramis
s
by
no
means
my
dear
porthos
that
man
is
a
messenger
of
general
cromwell
it
would
insure
for
us
a
poor
reception
i
imagine
should
it
be
announced
to
him
that
we
had
twisted
the
neck
of
his
nevertheless
said
porthos
i
have
always
noticed
that
aramis
gives
good
listen
returned
d
artagnan
when
our
embassy
is
finished
well
if
it
brings
us
back
to
france
well
well
we
shall
at
that
moment
the
two
friends
reached
the
hotel
arms
of
england
where
they
supped
with
hearty
appetite
and
then
at
once
proceeded
to
the
port
there
they
found
a
brig
ready
to
set
sail
upon
the
deck
of
which
they
recognized
mordaunt
walking
up
and
down
impatiently
it
is
singular
said
d
artagnan
whilst
the
boat
was
taking
them
to
the
standard
it
is
astonishing
how
that
young
man
resembles
some
one
i
must
have
known
but
who
it
was
i
can
not
yet
a
few
minutes
later
they
were
on
board
but
the
embarkation
of
the
horses
was
a
longer
matter
than
that
of
the
men
and
it
was
eight
o
clock
before
they
raised
anchor
the
young
man
stamped
impatiently
and
ordered
all
sail
to
be
spread
porthos
completely
used
up
by
three
nights
without
sleep
and
a
journey
of
seventy
leagues
on
horseback
retired
to
his
cabin
and
went
to
sleep
d
artagnan
overcoming
his
repugnance
to
mordaunt
walked
with
him
upon
the
deck
and
invented
a
hundred
stories
to
make
him
talk
mousqueton
was
seasick
the
scotchman
and
now
our
readers
must
leave
the
standard
to
sail
peaceably
not
toward
london
where
d
artagnan
and
porthos
believed
they
were
going
but
to
durham
whither
mordaunt
had
been
ordered
to
repair
by
the
letter
he
had
received
during
his
sojourn
at
boulogne
and
accompany
us
to
the
royalist
camp
on
this
side
of
the
tyne
near
newcastle
there
placed
between
two
rivers
on
the
borders
of
scotland
but
still
on
english
soil
the
tents
of
a
little
army
extended
it
was
midnight
some
highlanders
were
listlessly
keeping
watch
the
moon
which
was
partially
obscured
by
heavy
clouds
now
and
then
lit
up
the
muskets
of
the
sentinels
or
silvered
the
walls
the
roofs
and
the
spires
of
the
town
that
charles
had
just
surrendered
to
the
parliamentary
troops
whilst
oxford
and
newark
still
held
out
for
him
in
the
hopes
of
coming
to
some
arrangement
at
one
of
the
extremities
of
the
camp
near
an
immense
tent
in
which
the
scottish
officers
were
holding
a
kind
of
council
presided
over
by
lord
leven
their
commander
a
man
attired
as
a
cavalier
lay
sleeping
on
the
turf
his
right
hand
extended
over
his
sword
about
fifty
paces
off
another
man
also
appareled
as
a
cavalier
was
talking
to
a
scotch
sentinel
and
though
a
foreigner
he
seemed
to
understand
without
much
difficulty
the
answers
given
in
the
broad
perthshire
dialect
as
the
town
clock
of
newcastle
struck
one
the
sleeper
awoke
and
with
all
the
gestures
of
a
man
rousing
himself
out
of
deep
sleep
he
looked
attentively
about
him
perceiving
that
he
was
alone
he
rose
and
making
a
little
circuit
passed
close
to
the
cavalier
who
was
speaking
to
the
sentinel
the
former
had
no
doubt
finished
his
questions
for
a
moment
later
he
said
and
carelessly
followed
the
same
path
taken
by
the
first
cavalier
in
the
shadow
of
a
tent
the
former
was
awaiting
him
well
my
dear
friend
said
he
in
as
pure
french
as
has
ever
been
uttered
between
rouen
and
tours
well
my
friend
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
we
must
let
the
king
know
why
what
is
the
matter
it
would
take
too
long
to
tell
you
besides
you
will
hear
it
all
directly
and
the
least
word
dropped
here
might
ruin
all
we
must
go
and
find
lord
they
both
set
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
camp
but
as
it
did
not
cover
more
than
a
surface
of
five
hundred
feet
they
quickly
arrived
at
the
tent
they
were
looking
for
tony
is
your
master
sleeping
said
one
of
the
two
cavaliers
to
a
servant
who
was
lying
in
the
outer
compartment
which
served
as
a
kind
of
no
monsieur
le
comte
answered
the
servant
i
think
not
or
at
least
he
has
not
long
been
so
for
he
was
pacing
up
and
down
for
more
than
two
hours
after
he
left
the
king
and
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
has
only
ceased
during
the
last
ten
minutes
however
you
may
look
and
see
added
the
lackey
raising
the
curtained
entrance
of
the
tent
lord
winter
was
seated
near
an
aperture
arranged
as
a
window
to
let
in
the
night
air
his
eyes
mechanically
following
the
course
of
the
moon
intermittently
veiled
as
we
before
observed
by
heavy
clouds
the
two
friends
approached
winter
who
with
his
head
on
his
hands
was
gazing
at
the
heavens
he
did
not
hear
them
enter
and
remained
in
the
same
attitude
till
he
felt
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
he
turned
around
recognized
athos
and
aramis
and
held
out
his
hand
to
them
have
you
observed
said
he
to
them
what
a
color
the
moon
has
no
replied
athos
i
thought
it
looked
much
the
same
as
look
again
chevalier
returned
lord
winter
i
must
own
said
aramis
i
am
like
the
comte
de
la
fere
i
can
see
nothing
remarkable
about
my
lord
said
athos
in
a
position
so
precarious
as
ours
we
must
examine
the
earth
and
not
the
heavens
have
you
studied
our
scotch
troops
and
have
you
confidence
in
them
the
scotch
inquired
winter
what
scotch
ours
egad
exclaimed
athos
those
in
whom
the
king
has
confided
lord
leven
s
no
said
winter
then
he
paused
but
tell
me
can
you
not
perceive
the
russet
tint
which
marks
the
heavens
not
the
least
in
the
world
said
aramis
and
athos
at
once
tell
me
continued
winter
always
possessed
by
the
same
idea
is
there
not
a
tradition
in
france
that
henry
the
evening
before
the
day
he
was
assassinated
when
he
was
playing
at
chess
with
de
bassompiere
saw
clots
of
blood
upon
the
chessboard
yes
said
athos
and
the
marechal
has
often
told
me
so
then
it
was
so
murmured
winter
and
the
next
day
henry
iv
was
but
what
has
this
vision
of
henry
iv
to
do
with
you
my
lord
inquired
aramis
nothing
and
indeed
i
am
mad
to
trouble
you
with
such
things
when
your
coming
to
my
tent
at
such
an
hour
announces
that
you
are
the
bearers
of
important
yes
my
lord
said
athos
i
wish
to
speak
to
the
to
the
king
but
the
king
is
i
have
something
important
to
reveal
to
can
it
not
be
put
off
till
he
must
know
it
this
moment
and
perhaps
it
is
already
too
come
then
said
lord
winter
lord
winter
s
tent
was
pitched
by
the
side
of
the
royal
marquee
a
kind
of
corridor
communicating
between
the
two
this
corridor
was
guarded
not
by
a
sentinel
but
by
a
confidential
servant
through
whom
in
case
of
urgency
charles
could
communicate
instantly
with
his
faithful
subject
these
gentlemen
are
with
me
said
winter
the
lackey
bowed
and
let
them
pass
as
he
had
said
on
a
camp
bed
dressed
in
his
black
doublet
booted
unbelted
with
his
felt
hat
beside
him
lay
the
king
overcome
by
sleep
and
fatigue
they
advanced
and
athos
who
was
the
first
to
enter
gazed
a
moment
in
silence
on
that
pale
and
noble
face
framed
in
its
long
and
now
untidy
matted
hair
the
blue
veins
showing
through
the
transparent
temples
his
eyes
seemingly
swollen
by
tears
athos
sighed
deeply
the
sigh
woke
the
king
so
lightly
did
he
sleep
he
opened
his
eyes
ah
said
he
raising
himself
on
his
elbow
is
it
you
comte
de
la
fere
yes
sire
replied
athos
you
watch
while
i
sleep
and
you
have
come
to
bring
me
some
news
alas
sire
answered
athos
your
majesty
has
guessed
it
is
bad
news
yes
never
mind
the
messenger
is
welcome
you
never
come
to
me
without
conferring
pleasure
you
whose
devotion
recognizes
neither
country
nor
misfortune
you
who
are
sent
to
me
by
henrietta
whatever
news
you
bring
speak
sire
cromwell
has
arrived
this
night
at
ah
exclaimed
the
king
to
fight
no
sire
but
to
buy
your
what
did
you
say
i
said
sire
that
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
are
owing
to
the
scottish
for
unpaid
wages
yes
i
know
it
for
the
last
year
my
faithful
highlanders
have
fought
for
honor
athos
smiled
well
sir
though
honor
is
a
fine
thing
they
are
tired
of
fighting
for
it
and
they
have
sold
you
for
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
that
is
to
say
for
half
what
is
owing
impossible
cried
the
king
the
scotch
sell
their
king
for
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
and
who
is
the
judas
who
has
concluded
this
infamous
bargain
lord
are
you
certain
of
it
sir
i
heard
it
with
my
own
the
king
sighed
deeply
as
if
his
heart
would
break
and
then
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
oh
the
scotch
he
exclaimed
the
scotch
i
called
my
faithful
to
whom
i
trusted
myself
when
i
could
have
fled
to
oxford
the
scotch
my
brothers
but
are
you
well
assured
sir
lying
behind
the
tent
of
lord
leven
i
raised
it
and
saw
all
heard
all
and
when
is
this
to
be
consummated
this
morning
so
your
majesty
must
perceive
there
is
no
time
to
lose
to
do
what
since
you
say
i
am
to
cross
the
tyne
reach
scotland
and
rejoin
lord
montrose
who
will
not
sell
and
what
shall
i
do
in
scotland
a
war
of
partisans
unworthy
of
a
the
example
of
robert
bruce
will
absolve
you
no
no
i
have
fought
too
long
they
have
sold
me
they
shall
give
me
up
and
the
eternal
shame
of
treble
treason
shall
fall
on
their
sire
said
athos
perhaps
a
king
should
act
thus
but
not
a
husband
and
a
father
i
have
come
in
the
name
of
your
wife
and
daughter
and
of
the
children
you
have
still
in
london
and
i
say
to
you
live
sire
it
is
the
will
of
the
king
raised
himself
buckled
on
his
belt
and
passing
his
handkerchief
over
his
moist
forehead
said
well
what
is
to
be
done
sire
have
you
in
the
army
one
regiment
on
which
you
can
implicitly
rely
winter
said
the
king
do
you
believe
in
the
fidelity
of
yours
sire
they
are
but
men
and
men
are
become
both
weak
and
wicked
i
will
not
answer
for
them
i
would
confide
my
life
to
them
but
i
should
hesitate
ere
i
trusted
them
with
your
majesty
well
said
athos
since
you
have
not
a
regiment
we
are
three
devoted
men
it
is
enough
let
your
majesty
mount
on
horseback
and
place
yourself
in
the
midst
of
us
we
will
cross
the
tyne
reach
scotland
and
you
will
be
is
this
your
counsel
also
winter
inquired
the
king
yes
and
yours
monsieur
d
herblay
yes
as
you
wish
then
winter
give
the
necessary
winter
then
left
the
tent
in
the
meantime
the
king
finished
his
toilet
the
first
rays
of
daybreak
penetrated
the
aperture
of
the
tent
as
winter
it
all
is
ready
sire
said
he
for
us
also
inquired
athos
grimaud
and
blaisois
are
holding
your
horses
ready
in
that
case
exclaimed
athos
let
us
not
lose
an
instant
but
set
come
added
the
king
sire
said
aramis
will
not
your
majesty
acquaint
some
of
your
friends
of
this
friends
answered
charles
sadly
i
have
but
three
one
of
twenty
years
who
has
never
forgotten
me
and
two
of
a
week
s
standing
whom
i
shall
never
forget
come
gentlemen
come
the
king
quitted
his
tent
and
found
his
horse
ready
waiting
for
him
it
was
a
chestnut
that
the
king
had
ridden
for
three
years
and
of
which
he
was
very
fond
the
horse
neighed
with
pleasure
at
seeing
him
ah
said
the
king
i
was
unjust
here
is
a
creature
that
loves
me
you
at
least
will
be
faithful
to
me
the
horse
as
if
it
understood
these
words
bent
its
red
nostrils
toward
the
king
s
face
and
parting
his
lips
displayed
all
its
teeth
as
if
with
pleasure
yes
yes
said
the
king
caressing
it
with
his
hand
yes
my
arthur
thou
art
a
fond
and
faithful
after
this
little
scene
charles
threw
himself
into
the
saddle
and
turning
to
athos
aramis
and
winter
said
now
gentlemen
i
am
at
your
but
athos
was
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
black
line
which
bordered
the
banks
of
the
tyne
and
seemed
to
extend
double
the
length
of
the
camp
what
is
that
line
cried
athos
whose
vision
was
still
rather
obscured
by
the
uncertain
shades
and
of
daybreak
what
is
that
line
i
did
not
observe
it
it
must
be
the
fog
rising
from
the
river
said
the
king
sire
it
is
something
more
opaque
than
the
indeed
said
winter
it
appears
to
me
like
a
bar
of
red
it
is
the
enemy
who
have
made
a
sortie
from
newcastle
and
are
surrounding
us
exclaimed
athos
the
enemy
cried
the
king
yes
the
enemy
it
is
too
late
stop
a
moment
does
not
that
sunbeam
yonder
just
by
the
side
of
the
town
glitter
on
the
ironsides
this
was
the
name
given
the
cuirassiers
whom
cromwell
had
made
his
ah
said
the
king
we
shall
soon
see
whether
my
highlanders
have
betrayed
me
or
what
are
you
going
to
do
exclaimed
athos
to
give
them
the
order
to
charge
and
run
down
these
miserable
and
the
king
putting
spurs
to
his
horse
set
off
to
the
tent
of
lord
leven
follow
him
said
athos
come
exclaimed
aramis
is
the
king
wounded
cried
lord
winter
i
see
spots
of
blood
on
the
and
he
set
off
to
follow
the
two
friends
he
was
stopped
by
athos
go
and
call
out
your
regiment
said
he
i
can
foresee
that
we
shall
have
need
of
it
winter
turned
his
horse
and
the
two
friends
rode
on
it
had
taken
but
two
minutes
for
the
king
to
reach
the
tent
of
the
scottish
commander
he
dismounted
and
entered
the
general
was
there
surrounded
by
the
more
prominent
chiefs
the
king
they
exclaimed
as
all
rose
in
bewilderment
charles
was
indeed
in
the
midst
of
them
his
hat
on
his
head
his
brows
bent
striking
his
boot
with
his
riding
whip
yes
gentlemen
the
king
in
person
the
king
who
has
come
to
ask
for
some
account
of
what
has
what
is
the
matter
sire
exclaimed
lord
leven
it
is
this
sir
said
the
king
angrily
that
general
cromwell
has
reached
newcastle
that
you
knew
it
and
i
was
not
informed
of
it
that
the
enemy
have
left
the
town
and
are
now
closing
the
passages
of
the
tyne
against
us
that
our
sentinels
have
seen
this
movement
and
i
have
been
left
unacquainted
with
it
that
by
an
infamous
treaty
you
have
sold
me
for
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
parliament
of
this
treaty
at
least
i
have
been
warned
this
is
the
matter
gentlemen
answer
and
exculpate
yourselves
for
i
stand
here
to
accuse
sire
said
lord
leven
with
hesitation
sire
your
majesty
has
been
deceived
by
false
my
own
eyes
have
seen
the
enemy
extend
itself
between
myself
and
scotland
and
i
can
almost
say
that
with
my
own
ears
i
have
heard
the
clauses
of
the
treaty
the
scotch
chieftains
looked
at
each
other
in
their
turn
with
frowning
brows
sire
murmured
lord
leven
crushed
by
shame
sire
we
are
ready
to
give
you
every
proof
of
our
i
ask
but
one
said
the
king
put
the
army
in
battle
array
and
face
the
that
can
not
be
sire
said
the
earl
how
can
not
be
what
hinders
it
exclaimed
the
king
your
majesty
is
well
aware
that
there
is
a
truce
between
us
and
the
english
and
if
there
is
a
truce
the
english
army
has
broken
it
by
quitting
the
town
contrary
to
the
agreement
which
kept
it
there
now
i
tell
you
you
must
pass
with
me
through
this
army
across
to
scotland
and
if
you
refuse
you
may
choose
betwixt
two
names
which
the
contempt
of
all
honest
men
will
brand
you
with
you
are
either
cowards
or
traitors
the
eyes
of
the
scotch
flashed
fire
and
as
often
happens
on
such
occasions
from
shame
they
passed
to
effrontery
and
two
heads
of
clans
advanced
upon
the
king
yes
said
they
we
have
promised
to
deliver
scotland
and
england
from
him
who
for
the
last
years
has
sucked
the
blood
and
gold
of
scotland
and
england
we
have
promised
and
we
will
keep
our
promise
charles
stuart
you
are
our
and
both
extended
their
hands
as
if
to
seize
the
king
but
before
they
could
touch
him
with
the
tips
of
their
fingers
both
had
fallen
one
dead
the
other
stunned
aramis
had
passed
his
sword
through
the
body
of
the
first
and
athos
had
knocked
down
the
other
with
the
butt
end
of
his
pistol
then
as
lord
leven
and
the
other
chieftains
recoiled
before
this
unexpected
rescue
which
seemed
to
come
from
heaven
for
the
prince
they
already
thought
was
their
prisoner
athos
and
aramis
dragged
the
king
from
the
perjured
assembly
into
which
he
had
so
imprudently
ventured
and
throwing
themselves
on
horseback
all
three
returned
at
full
gallop
to
the
royal
tent
on
their
road
they
perceived
lord
winter
marching
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
the
king
motioned
him
to
accompany
them
the
avenger
they
all
four
entered
the
tent
they
had
no
plan
ready
they
must
think
of
one
the
king
threw
himself
into
an
i
am
lost
said
he
no
sire
replied
athos
you
are
only
the
king
sighed
deeply
betrayed
yes
betrayed
by
the
scotch
amongst
whom
i
was
born
whom
i
have
always
loved
better
than
the
english
oh
traitors
that
ye
are
sire
said
athos
this
is
not
a
moment
for
recrimination
but
a
time
to
show
yourself
a
king
and
a
gentleman
up
sire
up
for
you
have
here
at
least
three
men
who
will
not
betray
you
ah
if
we
had
been
five
murmured
athos
thinking
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
what
do
you
say
inquired
charles
rising
i
say
sire
that
there
is
now
but
one
way
open
lord
winter
answers
for
his
regiment
or
at
least
very
nearly
so
we
will
not
split
straws
about
words
let
him
place
himself
at
the
head
of
his
men
we
will
place
ourselves
at
the
side
of
your
majesty
and
we
will
mow
a
swath
through
cromwell
s
army
and
reach
there
is
another
method
said
aramis
let
one
of
us
put
on
the
dress
and
mount
the
king
s
horse
whilst
they
pursue
him
the
king
might
it
is
good
advice
said
athos
and
if
the
king
will
do
one
of
us
the
honor
we
shall
be
truly
grateful
to
what
do
you
think
of
this
counsel
winter
asked
the
king
looking
with
admiration
at
these
two
men
whose
chief
idea
seemed
to
be
how
they
could
take
on
their
shoulders
all
the
dangers
that
assailed
him
i
think
the
only
chance
of
saving
your
majesty
has
just
been
proposed
by
monsieur
d
herblay
i
humbly
entreat
your
majesty
to
choose
quickly
for
we
have
not
an
instant
to
but
if
i
accept
it
is
death
or
at
least
imprisonment
for
him
who
takes
my
he
will
have
had
the
glory
of
having
saved
his
king
cried
winter
the
king
looked
at
his
old
friend
with
tears
in
his
eyes
undid
the
order
of
the
saint
esprit
which
he
wore
to
honor
the
two
frenchmen
who
were
with
him
and
passed
it
around
winter
s
neck
who
received
on
his
knees
this
striking
proof
of
his
sovereign
s
confidence
and
friendship
it
is
right
said
athos
he
has
served
your
majesty
longer
than
we
the
king
overheard
these
words
and
turned
around
with
tears
in
his
eyes
wait
a
moment
sir
said
he
i
have
an
order
for
each
of
you
he
turned
to
a
closet
where
his
own
orders
were
locked
up
and
took
out
two
ribbons
of
the
order
of
the
garter
these
can
not
be
for
us
said
athos
why
not
sir
asked
charles
such
are
for
royalty
and
we
are
simple
speak
not
of
crowns
i
shall
not
find
amongst
them
such
great
hearts
as
yours
no
no
you
do
yourselves
injustice
but
i
am
here
to
do
you
justice
on
your
knees
athos
knelt
down
and
the
king
passed
the
ribbon
down
from
left
to
right
as
usual
raised
his
sword
and
instead
of
pronouncing
the
customary
formula
i
make
you
a
knight
be
brave
faithful
and
loyal
he
said
you
are
brave
faithful
and
loyal
i
knight
you
monsieur
le
then
turning
to
aramis
he
said
it
is
now
your
turn
monsieur
le
the
same
ceremony
recommenced
with
the
same
words
whilst
winter
unlaced
his
leather
cuirass
that
he
might
disguise
himself
like
the
king
charles
having
proceeded
with
aramis
as
with
athos
embraced
them
both
sire
said
winter
who
in
this
trying
emergency
felt
all
his
strength
and
energy
fire
up
we
are
the
king
looked
at
the
three
gentlemen
then
we
must
fly
said
he
flying
through
an
army
sire
said
athos
in
all
countries
in
the
world
is
called
then
i
shall
die
sword
in
hand
said
charles
monsieur
le
comte
monsieur
le
chevalier
if
ever
i
am
king
sire
you
have
already
done
us
more
honor
than
simple
gentlemen
could
ever
aspire
to
therefore
gratitude
is
on
our
side
but
we
must
not
lose
time
we
have
already
wasted
too
the
king
again
shook
hands
with
all
three
exchanged
hats
with
winter
and
went
out
winter
s
regiment
was
ranged
on
some
high
ground
above
the
camp
the
king
followed
by
the
three
friends
turned
his
steps
that
way
the
scotch
camp
seemed
as
if
at
last
awakened
the
soldiers
had
come
out
of
their
tents
and
taken
up
their
station
in
battle
array
do
you
see
that
said
the
king
perhaps
they
are
penitent
and
preparing
to
if
they
are
penitent
said
athos
let
them
follow
well
said
the
king
what
shall
we
do
let
us
examine
the
enemy
s
at
the
same
instant
the
eyes
of
the
little
group
were
fixed
on
the
same
line
which
at
daybreak
they
had
mistaken
for
fog
and
which
the
morning
sun
now
plainly
showed
was
an
army
in
order
of
battle
the
air
was
soft
and
clear
as
it
generally
is
at
that
early
hour
of
the
morning
the
regiments
the
standards
and
even
the
colors
of
the
horses
and
uniforms
were
now
clearly
distinct
on
the
summit
of
a
rising
ground
a
little
in
advance
of
the
enemy
appeared
a
short
and
heavy
looking
man
this
man
was
surrounded
by
officers
he
turned
a
spyglass
toward
the
little
group
amongst
which
the
king
stood
does
this
man
know
your
majesty
personally
inquired
aramis
charles
smiled
that
man
is
cromwell
said
he
then
draw
down
your
hat
sire
that
he
may
not
discover
the
ah
said
athos
how
much
time
we
have
now
said
the
king
give
the
word
and
let
us
will
you
not
give
it
sire
asked
athos
no
i
make
you
my
said
the
king
listen
then
lord
winter
proceed
sire
i
beg
what
we
are
going
to
say
does
not
concern
your
the
king
smiling
turned
a
few
steps
back
this
is
what
i
propose
to
do
said
athos
we
will
divide
our
regiments
into
two
squadrons
you
will
put
yourself
at
the
head
of
the
first
we
and
his
majesty
will
lead
the
second
if
no
obstacle
occurs
we
will
both
charge
together
force
the
enemy
s
line
and
throw
ourselves
into
the
tyne
which
we
must
cross
either
by
fording
or
swimming
if
on
the
contrary
any
repulse
should
take
place
you
and
your
men
must
fight
to
the
last
man
whilst
we
and
the
king
proceed
on
our
road
once
arrived
at
the
brink
of
the
river
should
we
even
find
them
three
ranks
deep
as
long
as
you
and
your
regiment
do
your
duty
we
will
look
to
the
to
horse
said
lord
winter
to
horse
athos
everything
is
arranged
and
now
gentlemen
cried
the
king
forward
and
rally
to
the
old
cry
of
france
montjoy
and
denis
the
war
cry
of
england
is
too
often
in
the
mouths
of
they
mounted
the
king
on
winter
s
horse
and
winter
on
that
of
the
king
then
winter
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
the
first
squadron
and
the
king
with
athos
on
his
right
and
aramis
on
his
left
at
the
head
of
the
second
the
scotch
army
stood
motionless
and
silent
seized
with
shame
at
sight
of
these
preparations
some
of
the
chieftains
left
the
ranks
and
broke
their
swords
in
two
there
said
the
king
that
consoles
me
they
are
not
all
at
this
moment
winter
s
voice
was
raised
with
the
cry
of
forward
the
first
squadron
moved
off
the
second
followed
and
descended
from
the
plateau
a
regiment
of
cuirassiers
nearly
equal
as
to
numbers
issued
from
behind
the
hill
and
came
full
gallop
toward
it
the
king
pointed
this
out
sire
said
athos
we
foresaw
this
and
if
lord
winter
s
men
but
do
their
duty
we
are
saved
instead
of
at
this
moment
they
heard
above
all
the
galloping
and
neighing
of
the
horses
winter
s
voice
crying
out
sword
in
hand
at
these
words
every
sword
was
drawn
and
glittered
in
the
air
like
lightning
now
gentlemen
said
the
king
in
his
turn
excited
by
this
sight
come
gentlemen
sword
in
hand
but
aramis
and
athos
were
the
only
ones
to
obey
this
command
and
the
king
s
example
we
are
betrayed
said
the
king
in
a
low
voice
wait
a
moment
said
athos
perhaps
they
do
not
recognize
your
majesty
s
voice
and
await
the
order
of
their
have
they
not
heard
that
of
their
colonel
but
look
look
cried
the
king
drawing
up
his
horse
with
a
sudden
jerk
which
threw
it
on
its
haunches
and
seizing
the
bridle
of
athos
s
horse
ah
cowards
traitors
screamed
lord
winter
whose
voice
they
heard
whilst
his
men
quitting
their
ranks
dispersed
all
over
the
plain
about
fifteen
men
were
ranged
around
him
and
awaited
the
charge
of
cromwell
s
cuirassiers
let
us
go
and
die
with
them
said
the
king
let
us
go
said
athos
and
aramis
all
faithful
hearts
with
me
cried
out
winter
this
voice
was
heard
by
the
two
friends
who
set
off
full
gallop
no
quarter
cried
a
voice
in
french
answering
to
that
of
winter
which
made
them
tremble
as
for
winter
at
the
sound
of
that
voice
he
turned
pale
and
was
as
it
were
petrified
it
was
the
voice
of
a
cavalier
mounted
on
a
magnificent
black
horse
who
was
charging
at
the
head
of
the
english
regiment
of
which
in
his
ardor
he
was
ten
steps
in
advance
tis
he
murmured
winter
his
eyes
glazed
and
he
allowed
his
sword
to
fall
to
his
side
the
king
the
king
cried
out
several
voices
deceived
by
the
blue
ribbon
and
chestnut
horse
of
winter
take
him
no
it
is
not
the
king
exclaimed
the
cavalier
lord
winter
you
are
not
the
king
you
are
my
at
the
same
moment
mordaunt
for
it
was
he
leveled
his
pistol
at
winter
it
went
off
and
the
ball
entered
the
heart
of
the
old
cavalier
who
with
one
bound
on
his
saddle
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
athos
murmuring
he
is
avenged
think
of
my
mother
shouted
mordaunt
as
his
horse
plunged
and
darted
off
at
full
gallop
wretch
exclaimed
aramis
raising
his
pistol
as
he
passed
by
him
but
the
powder
flashed
in
the
pan
and
it
did
not
go
off
at
this
moment
the
whole
regiment
came
up
and
they
fell
upon
the
few
men
who
had
held
out
surrounding
the
two
frenchmen
athos
after
making
sure
that
lord
winter
was
really
dead
let
fall
the
corpse
and
said
come
aramis
now
for
the
honor
of
france
and
the
two
englishmen
who
were
nearest
to
them
fell
mortally
wounded
at
the
same
moment
a
fearful
hurrah
rent
the
air
and
thirty
blades
glittered
about
their
heads
suddenly
a
man
sprang
out
of
the
english
ranks
fell
upon
athos
twined
arms
of
steel
around
him
and
tearing
his
sword
from
him
said
in
his
ear
silence
yield
you
yield
to
me
do
you
not
a
giant
had
seized
also
aramis
s
two
wrists
who
struggled
in
vain
to
release
himself
from
this
formidable
grasp
d
art
exclaimed
athos
whilst
the
gascon
covered
his
mouth
with
his
hand
i
am
your
prisoner
said
aramis
giving
up
his
sword
to
porthos
fire
fire
cried
mordaunt
returning
to
the
group
surrounding
the
two
friends
and
wherefore
fire
said
the
colonel
every
one
has
it
is
the
son
of
milady
said
athos
to
d
artagnan
i
recognize
it
is
the
monk
whispered
porthos
to
aramis
i
know
and
now
the
ranks
began
to
open
d
artagnan
held
the
bridle
of
athos
s
horse
and
porthos
that
of
aramis
both
of
them
attempted
to
lead
his
prisoner
off
the
this
movement
revealed
the
spot
where
winter
s
body
had
fallen
mordaunt
had
found
it
out
and
was
gazing
on
his
dead
relative
with
an
expression
of
malignant
hatred
athos
though
now
cool
and
collected
put
his
hand
to
his
belt
where
his
loaded
pistols
yet
remained
what
are
you
about
said
d
artagnan
let
me
kill
we
are
all
four
lost
if
by
the
least
gesture
you
discover
that
you
recognize
then
turning
to
the
young
man
he
exclaimed
a
fine
prize
a
fine
prize
friend
mordaunt
we
have
both
myself
and
monsieur
du
vallon
taken
two
knights
of
the
garter
nothing
but
said
mordaunt
looking
at
athos
and
aramis
with
bloodshot
eyes
these
are
frenchmen
i
i
faith
i
don
t
know
are
you
french
sir
said
he
to
athos
i
am
replied
the
latter
gravely
very
well
my
dear
sir
you
are
the
prisoner
of
a
fellow
but
the
king
where
is
the
king
exclaimed
athos
anxiously
d
artagnan
vigorously
seized
his
prisoner
s
hand
saying
eh
the
king
we
have
secured
yes
said
aramis
through
an
infamous
act
of
porthos
pressed
his
friend
s
hand
and
said
to
him
yes
sir
all
is
fair
in
war
stratagem
as
well
as
force
look
yonder
at
this
instant
the
squadron
that
ought
to
have
protected
charles
s
retreat
was
advancing
to
meet
the
english
regiments
the
king
who
was
entirely
surrounded
walked
alone
in
a
great
empty
space
he
appeared
calm
but
it
was
evidently
not
without
a
mighty
effort
drops
of
perspiration
trickled
down
his
face
and
from
time
to
time
he
put
a
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
to
wipe
away
the
blood
that
rilled
from
it
behold
nebuchadnezzar
exclaimed
an
old
puritan
soldier
whose
eyes
flashed
at
the
sight
of
the
man
they
called
the
tyrant
do
you
call
him
nebuchadnezzar
said
mordaunt
with
a
terrible
smile
no
it
is
charles
the
first
the
king
the
good
king
charles
who
despoils
his
subjects
to
enrich
charles
glanced
a
moment
at
the
insolent
creature
who
uttered
this
but
did
not
recognize
him
nevertheless
the
calm
religious
dignity
of
his
countenance
abashed
mordaunt
bon
jour
messieurs
said
the
king
to
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
held
by
d
artagnan
and
porthos
the
day
has
been
unfortunate
but
it
is
not
your
fault
thank
god
but
where
is
my
old
friend
winter
the
two
gentlemen
turned
away
their
heads
in
silence
in
strafford
s
company
said
mordaunt
tauntingly
charles
shuddered
the
demon
had
known
how
to
wound
him
the
remembrance
of
strafford
was
a
source
of
lasting
remorse
to
him
the
shadow
that
haunted
him
by
day
and
night
the
king
looked
around
him
he
saw
a
corpse
at
his
feet
it
was
winter
s
he
uttered
not
a
word
nor
shed
a
tear
but
a
deadly
pallor
spread
over
his
face
he
knelt
down
on
the
ground
raised
winter
s
head
and
unfastening
the
order
of
the
saint
esprit
placed
it
on
his
own
breast
lord
winter
is
killed
then
inquired
d
artagnan
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
corpse
yes
said
athos
by
his
own
come
he
was
the
first
of
us
to
go
peace
be
to
him
he
was
an
honest
man
said
d
artagnan
charles
stuart
said
the
colonel
of
the
english
regiment
approaching
the
king
who
had
just
put
on
the
insignia
of
royalty
do
you
yield
yourself
a
prisoner
colonel
tomlison
said
charles
kings
can
not
yield
the
man
alone
submits
to
your
the
king
drew
his
sword
and
broke
it
on
his
knee
at
this
moment
a
horse
without
a
rider
covered
with
foam
his
nostrils
extended
and
eyes
all
fire
galloped
up
and
recognizing
his
master
stopped
and
neighed
with
pleasure
it
was
arthur
the
king
smiled
patted
it
with
his
hand
and
jumped
lightly
into
the
saddle
now
gentlemen
said
he
conduct
me
where
you
turning
back
again
he
said
i
thought
i
saw
winter
move
if
he
still
lives
by
all
you
hold
most
sacred
do
not
abandon
never
fear
king
charles
said
mordaunt
the
bullet
pierced
his
do
not
breathe
a
word
nor
make
the
least
sign
to
me
or
porthos
said
d
artagnan
to
athos
and
aramis
that
you
recognize
this
man
for
milady
is
not
dead
her
soul
lives
in
the
body
of
this
the
detachment
now
moved
toward
the
town
with
the
royal
captive
but
on
the
road
an
from
cromwell
sent
orders
that
colonel
tomlison
should
conduct
him
to
holdenby
castle
at
the
same
time
couriers
started
in
every
direction
over
england
and
europe
to
announce
that
charles
stuart
was
the
prisoner
of
oliver
cromwell
oliver
cromwell
have
you
been
to
the
general
said
mordaunt
to
d
artagnan
and
porthos
you
know
he
sent
for
you
after
the
we
want
first
to
put
our
prisoners
in
a
place
of
safety
replied
d
artagnan
do
you
know
sir
these
gentlemen
are
each
of
them
worth
fifteen
hundred
pounds
oh
be
assured
said
mordaunt
looking
at
them
with
an
expression
he
vainly
endeavoured
to
soften
my
soldiers
will
guard
them
and
guard
them
well
i
promise
i
shall
take
better
care
of
them
myself
answered
d
artagnan
besides
all
they
require
is
a
good
room
with
sentinels
or
their
simple
parole
that
they
will
not
attempt
escape
i
will
go
and
see
about
that
and
then
we
shall
have
the
honor
of
presenting
ourselves
to
the
general
and
receiving
his
commands
for
his
you
think
of
starting
at
once
then
inquired
mordaunt
our
mission
is
ended
and
there
is
nothing
more
to
detain
us
now
but
the
good
pleasure
of
the
great
man
to
whom
we
were
the
young
man
bit
his
lips
and
whispered
to
his
sergeant
you
will
follow
these
men
and
not
lose
sight
of
them
when
you
have
discovered
where
they
lodge
come
and
await
me
at
the
town
the
sergeant
made
a
sign
of
comprehension
instead
of
following
the
knot
of
prisoners
that
were
being
taken
into
the
town
mordaunt
turned
his
steps
toward
the
rising
ground
from
whence
cromwell
had
witnessed
the
battle
and
on
which
he
had
just
had
his
tent
pitched
cromwell
had
given
orders
that
no
one
was
to
be
allowed
admission
but
the
sentinel
who
knew
that
mordaunt
was
one
of
the
most
confidential
friends
of
the
general
thought
the
order
did
not
extend
to
the
young
man
mordaunt
therefore
raised
the
canvas
and
saw
cromwell
seated
before
a
table
his
head
buried
in
his
hands
his
back
being
turned
whether
he
heard
mordaunt
or
not
as
he
entered
cromwell
did
not
move
mordaunt
remained
standing
near
the
door
at
last
after
a
few
moments
cromwell
raised
his
head
and
as
if
he
divined
that
some
one
was
there
turned
slowly
around
i
said
i
wished
to
be
alone
he
exclaimed
on
seeing
the
young
man
they
thought
this
order
did
not
concern
me
sir
nevertheless
if
you
wish
it
i
am
ready
to
ah
is
it
you
mordaunt
said
cromwell
the
cloud
passing
away
from
his
face
since
you
are
here
it
is
well
you
may
i
come
to
congratulate
to
congratulate
me
what
for
on
the
capture
of
charles
stuart
you
are
now
master
of
i
was
much
more
really
so
two
hours
how
so
general
because
england
had
need
of
me
to
take
the
tyrant
and
now
the
tyrant
is
taken
have
you
seen
him
yes
said
mordaunt
what
is
his
bearing
mordaunt
hesitated
but
it
seemed
as
though
he
was
constrained
to
tell
the
truth
calm
and
dignified
said
he
what
did
he
say
some
parting
words
to
his
his
friends
murmured
cromwell
has
he
any
friends
then
he
added
aloud
did
he
make
any
resistance
no
sir
with
the
exception
of
two
or
three
friends
every
one
deserted
him
he
had
no
means
of
to
whom
did
he
give
up
his
sword
he
did
not
give
it
up
he
broke
he
did
well
but
instead
of
breaking
it
he
might
have
used
it
to
still
more
there
was
a
momentary
pause
i
heard
that
the
colonel
of
the
regiment
that
escorted
charles
was
killed
said
cromwell
staring
very
fixedly
at
mordaunt
yes
by
whom
inquired
cromwell
by
what
was
his
name
lord
your
uncle
exclaimed
cromwell
my
uncle
answered
mordaunt
but
traitors
to
england
are
no
longer
members
of
my
cromwell
observed
the
young
man
a
moment
in
silence
then
with
that
profound
melancholy
shakespeare
describes
so
well
mordaunt
he
said
you
are
a
terrible
when
the
lord
commands
said
mordaunt
his
commands
are
not
to
be
disputed
abraham
raised
the
knife
against
isaac
and
isaac
was
his
yes
said
cromwell
but
the
lord
did
not
suffer
that
sacrifice
to
be
i
have
looked
around
me
said
mordaunt
and
i
have
seen
neither
goat
nor
kid
caught
among
the
bushes
of
the
cromwell
bowed
you
are
strong
among
the
strong
mordaunt
he
said
and
the
frenchmen
how
did
they
behave
most
yes
yes
murmured
cromwell
the
french
fight
well
and
if
my
glass
was
good
and
i
mistake
not
they
were
foremost
in
the
they
were
replied
mordaunt
after
you
however
said
cromwell
it
was
the
fault
of
their
horses
not
another
pause
and
the
scotch
they
kept
their
word
and
never
stirred
said
mordaunt
wretched
men
their
officers
wish
to
see
you
i
have
no
time
to
see
them
are
they
paid
yes
let
them
be
off
and
return
to
their
own
country
there
to
hide
their
shame
if
its
hills
are
high
enough
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
them
nor
they
with
me
and
now
go
before
i
go
said
mordaunt
i
have
some
questions
and
a
favor
to
ask
you
a
favor
from
me
mordaunt
bowed
i
come
to
you
my
leader
my
head
my
father
and
i
ask
you
master
are
you
contented
with
me
cromwell
looked
at
him
with
astonishment
the
young
man
remained
immovable
yes
said
cromwell
you
have
done
since
i
knew
you
not
only
your
duty
but
more
than
your
duty
you
have
been
a
faithful
friend
a
cautious
negotiator
a
brave
do
you
remember
sir
it
was
my
idea
the
scotch
treaty
for
giving
up
the
king
yes
the
idea
was
yours
i
had
no
such
contempt
for
men
was
i
not
a
good
ambassador
in
france
yes
for
mazarin
has
granted
what
i
have
i
not
always
fought
for
your
glory
and
interests
too
ardently
perhaps
it
is
what
i
have
just
reproached
you
for
but
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
these
questions
to
tell
you
my
lord
that
the
moment
has
now
arrived
when
with
a
single
word
you
may
recompense
all
these
oh
said
oliver
with
a
slight
curl
of
his
lip
i
forgot
that
every
service
merits
some
reward
and
that
up
to
this
moment
you
have
not
been
sir
i
can
take
my
pay
at
this
moment
to
the
full
extent
of
my
how
is
that
i
have
the
payment
under
my
hand
i
almost
possess
what
is
it
have
they
offered
you
money
do
you
wish
a
step
or
some
place
in
the
government
sir
will
you
grant
me
my
request
let
us
hear
what
it
is
sir
when
you
have
told
me
to
obey
an
order
did
i
ever
answer
let
me
see
that
order
if
however
your
wish
should
be
one
impossible
to
fulfill
when
you
have
cherished
a
wish
and
have
charged
me
with
its
fulfillment
have
i
ever
replied
it
is
impossible
but
a
request
preferred
with
so
much
preparation
ah
do
not
fear
sir
said
mordaunt
with
apparent
simplicity
it
will
not
ruin
well
then
said
cromwell
i
promise
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
to
grant
your
request
sir
two
prisoners
were
taken
this
morning
will
you
let
me
have
them
for
their
ransom
have
they
then
offered
a
large
one
inquired
cromwell
on
the
contrary
i
think
they
are
poor
they
are
friends
of
yours
then
yes
sir
exclaimed
mordaunt
they
are
friends
dear
friends
of
mine
and
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
very
well
mordaunt
exclaimed
cromwell
pleased
at
having
his
opinion
of
the
young
man
raised
once
more
i
will
give
them
to
you
i
will
not
even
ask
who
they
are
do
as
you
like
with
thank
you
sir
exclaimed
mordaunt
thank
you
my
life
is
always
at
your
service
and
should
i
lose
it
i
should
still
owe
you
something
thank
you
you
have
indeed
repaid
me
munificently
for
my
he
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
cromwell
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
puritan
general
who
did
not
like
this
almost
kingly
homage
he
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
what
said
cromwell
arresting
him
for
a
moment
as
he
arose
is
there
nothing
more
you
wish
neither
gold
nor
rank
you
have
given
me
all
you
can
give
me
and
from
your
debt
is
and
mordaunt
darted
out
of
the
general
s
tent
his
heart
beating
and
his
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
cromwell
gazed
a
moment
after
him
he
has
slain
his
uncle
he
murmured
alas
what
are
my
servants
possibly
this
one
who
asks
nothing
or
seems
to
ask
nothing
has
asked
more
in
the
eyes
of
heaven
than
those
who
tax
the
country
and
steal
the
bread
of
the
poor
nobody
serves
me
for
nothing
charles
who
is
my
prisoner
may
still
have
friends
but
i
have
none
and
with
a
deep
sigh
he
again
sank
into
the
reverie
that
had
been
interrupted
by
mordaunt
jesus
seigneur
whilst
mordaunt
was
making
his
way
to
cromwell
s
tent
d
artagnan
and
porthos
had
brought
their
prisoners
to
the
house
which
had
been
assigned
to
them
as
their
dwelling
at
newcastle
the
order
given
by
mordaunt
to
the
sergeant
had
been
heard
by
d
artagnan
who
accordingly
by
an
expressive
glance
warned
athos
and
aramis
to
exercise
extreme
caution
the
prisoners
therefore
had
remained
silent
as
they
marched
along
in
company
with
their
conquerors
which
they
could
do
with
the
less
difficulty
since
each
of
them
had
occupation
enough
in
answering
his
own
thoughts
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
mousqueton
s
astonishment
when
from
the
threshold
of
the
door
he
saw
the
four
friends
approaching
followed
by
a
sergeant
with
a
dozen
men
he
rubbed
his
eyes
doubting
if
he
really
saw
before
him
athos
and
aramis
and
forced
at
last
to
yield
to
evidence
he
was
on
the
point
of
breaking
forth
in
exclamations
when
he
encountered
a
glance
from
the
eyes
of
porthos
the
repressive
force
of
which
he
was
not
inclined
to
dispute
mousqueton
remained
glued
to
the
door
awaiting
the
explanation
of
this
strange
occurrence
what
upset
him
completely
was
that
the
four
friends
seemed
to
have
no
acquaintance
with
one
another
the
house
to
which
d
artagnan
and
porthos
conducted
athos
and
aramis
was
the
one
assigned
to
them
by
general
cromwell
and
of
which
they
had
taken
possession
on
the
previous
evening
it
was
at
the
corner
of
two
streets
and
had
in
the
rear
bordering
on
the
side
street
stables
and
a
sort
of
garden
the
windows
on
the
ground
floor
according
to
a
custom
in
provincial
villages
were
barred
so
that
they
strongly
resembled
the
windows
of
a
prison
the
two
friends
made
the
prisoners
enter
the
house
first
whilst
they
stood
at
the
door
desiring
mousqueton
to
take
the
four
horses
to
the
stable
why
don
t
we
go
in
with
them
asked
porthos
we
must
first
see
what
the
sergeant
wishes
us
to
do
replied
d
artagnan
the
sergeant
and
his
men
took
possession
of
the
little
garden
d
artagnan
asked
them
what
they
wished
and
why
they
had
taken
that
position
we
have
had
orders
answered
the
man
to
help
you
in
taking
care
of
your
there
could
be
no
fault
to
find
with
this
arrangement
on
the
contrary
it
seemed
to
be
a
delicate
attention
to
be
gratefully
received
d
artagnan
therefore
thanked
the
man
and
gave
him
a
crown
piece
to
drink
to
general
cromwell
s
health
the
sergeant
answered
that
puritans
never
drank
and
put
the
crown
piece
in
his
pocket
ah
said
porthos
what
a
fearful
day
my
dear
d
artagnan
what
a
fearful
day
when
we
find
our
friends
yes
but
under
what
circumstances
tis
true
that
our
position
is
an
awkward
one
but
let
us
go
in
and
see
more
clearly
what
is
to
be
things
look
black
enough
replied
porthos
i
understand
now
why
aramis
advised
me
to
strangle
that
horrible
silence
cried
the
gascon
do
not
utter
that
but
argued
porthos
i
speak
french
and
they
are
all
d
artagnan
looked
at
porthos
with
that
air
of
wonder
which
a
cunning
man
can
not
help
feeling
at
displays
of
crass
stupidity
but
as
porthos
on
his
side
could
not
comprehend
his
astonishment
he
merely
pushed
him
indoors
saying
let
us
go
they
found
athos
in
profound
despondency
aramis
looked
first
at
porthos
and
then
at
d
artagnan
without
speaking
but
the
latter
understood
his
meaningful
look
you
want
to
know
how
we
came
here
tis
easily
guessed
mazarin
sent
us
with
a
letter
to
general
but
how
came
you
to
fall
into
company
with
mordaunt
whom
i
bade
you
distrust
asked
athos
and
whom
i
advised
you
to
strangle
porthos
said
aramis
mazarin
again
cromwell
had
sent
him
to
mazarin
mazarin
sent
us
to
cromwell
there
is
a
certain
fatality
in
yes
you
are
right
d
artagnan
a
fatality
that
will
separate
and
ruin
us
so
my
dear
aramis
say
no
more
about
it
and
let
us
prepare
to
submit
to
zounds
on
the
contrary
let
us
speak
about
it
for
it
was
agreed
among
us
once
for
all
that
we
should
always
hold
together
though
engaged
on
opposing
yes
added
athos
i
now
ask
you
d
artagnan
what
side
you
are
on
ah
behold
for
what
end
the
wretched
mazarin
has
made
use
of
you
do
you
know
in
what
crime
you
are
engaged
in
the
capture
of
a
king
his
degradation
and
his
oh
oh
cried
porthos
do
you
think
so
you
are
exaggerating
athos
we
are
not
so
far
gone
as
that
replied
the
lieutenant
good
heavens
we
are
on
the
very
eve
of
it
i
say
why
is
the
king
taken
prisoner
those
who
wish
to
respect
him
as
a
master
would
not
buy
him
as
a
slave
do
you
think
it
is
to
replace
him
on
the
throne
that
cromwell
has
paid
for
him
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
sterling
they
will
kill
him
you
may
be
sure
of
i
don
t
maintain
the
contrary
said
d
artagnan
but
what
s
that
to
us
i
am
here
because
i
am
a
soldier
and
have
to
obey
orders
i
have
taken
an
oath
to
obey
and
i
do
obey
but
you
who
have
taken
no
such
oath
why
are
you
here
and
what
cause
do
you
represent
that
most
sacred
in
the
world
said
athos
the
cause
of
misfortune
of
religion
royalty
a
friend
a
wife
a
daughter
have
done
us
the
honor
to
call
us
to
their
aid
we
have
served
them
to
the
best
of
our
poor
means
and
god
will
recompense
the
will
forgive
the
want
of
power
you
may
see
matters
differently
d
artagnan
and
think
otherwise
i
will
not
attempt
to
argue
with
you
but
i
blame
heyday
cried
d
artagnan
what
matters
it
to
me
after
all
if
cromwell
who
s
an
englishman
revolts
against
his
king
who
is
a
scotchman
i
am
myself
a
frenchman
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
these
things
why
hold
me
responsible
yes
said
porthos
because
all
gentlemen
are
brothers
because
you
are
a
gentleman
because
the
kings
of
all
countries
are
the
first
among
gentlemen
because
the
blind
populace
ungrateful
and
brutal
always
takes
pleasure
in
pulling
down
what
is
above
them
and
you
you
d
artagnan
a
man
sprung
from
the
ancient
nobility
of
france
bearing
an
honorable
name
carrying
a
good
sword
have
helped
to
give
up
a
king
to
beersellers
shopkeepers
and
wagoners
ah
d
artagnan
perhaps
you
have
done
your
duty
as
a
soldier
but
as
a
gentleman
i
say
that
you
are
very
d
artagnan
was
chewing
the
stalk
of
a
flower
unable
to
reply
and
thoroughly
uncomfortable
for
when
turned
from
the
eyes
of
athos
he
encountered
those
of
aramis
and
you
porthos
continued
the
count
as
if
in
consideration
for
d
artagnan
s
embarrassment
you
the
best
heart
the
best
friend
the
best
soldier
that
i
know
you
with
a
soul
that
makes
you
worthy
of
a
birth
on
the
steps
of
a
throne
and
who
sooner
or
later
must
receive
your
reward
from
an
intelligent
king
you
my
dear
porthos
you
a
gentleman
in
manners
in
tastes
and
in
courage
you
are
as
culpable
as
d
porthos
blushed
but
with
pleasure
rather
than
with
confusion
and
yet
bowing
his
head
as
if
humiliated
he
said
yes
yes
my
dear
count
i
feel
that
you
are
athos
arose
come
he
said
stretching
out
his
hand
to
d
artagnan
come
don
t
be
sullen
my
dear
son
for
i
have
said
all
this
to
you
if
not
in
the
tone
at
least
with
the
feelings
of
a
father
it
would
have
been
easier
to
me
merely
to
have
thanked
you
for
preserving
my
life
and
not
to
have
uttered
a
word
of
all
doubtless
doubtless
athos
but
here
it
is
you
have
sentiments
the
devil
knows
what
such
as
every
one
can
t
entertain
who
could
suppose
that
a
sensible
man
could
leave
his
house
france
his
ward
a
charming
youth
for
we
saw
him
in
the
camp
to
fly
to
the
aid
of
a
rotten
royalty
which
is
going
to
crumble
one
of
these
days
like
an
old
hovel
the
sentiments
you
air
are
certainly
fine
so
fine
that
they
are
however
that
may
be
d
artagnan
replied
athos
without
falling
into
the
snare
which
his
gascon
friend
had
prepared
for
him
by
an
appeal
to
his
parental
love
however
that
may
be
you
know
in
the
bottom
of
your
heart
that
it
is
true
but
i
am
wrong
to
dispute
with
my
master
d
artagnan
i
am
your
prisoner
treat
me
as
ah
pardieu
said
d
artagnan
you
know
you
will
not
be
my
prisoner
very
no
said
aramis
they
will
doubtless
treat
us
like
the
prisoners
of
the
and
how
were
they
treated
asked
d
artagnan
why
said
aramis
were
hanged
and
the
other
half
were
well
i
said
d
artagnan
i
answer
that
while
there
remains
a
drop
of
blood
in
my
veins
you
will
be
neither
hanged
nor
shot
sang
diou
let
them
come
on
besides
do
you
see
that
door
athos
yes
what
then
well
you
can
go
out
by
that
door
whenever
you
please
for
from
this
moment
you
are
free
as
the
i
recognize
you
there
my
brave
d
artagnan
replied
athos
but
you
are
no
longer
our
masters
that
door
is
guarded
d
artagnan
you
know
very
well
you
will
force
it
said
porthos
there
are
only
a
dozen
men
at
the
that
would
be
nothing
for
us
four
it
is
too
much
for
us
two
no
divided
as
we
now
are
we
must
perish
see
the
fatal
example
on
the
vendomois
road
d
artagnan
you
so
brave
and
you
porthos
so
valiant
and
so
strong
you
were
beaten
aramis
and
i
are
beaten
in
our
turn
now
that
never
happened
to
us
when
we
were
four
together
let
us
die
then
as
de
winter
has
died
as
for
me
i
will
fly
only
on
condition
that
we
all
fly
impossible
said
d
artagnan
we
are
under
mazarin
s
i
know
it
and
i
have
nothing
more
to
say
my
arguments
lead
to
nothing
doubtless
they
are
bad
since
they
have
not
determined
minds
so
just
as
besides
said
aramis
had
they
taken
effect
it
would
be
still
better
not
to
compromise
two
excellent
friends
like
d
artagnan
and
porthos
be
assured
gentlemen
we
shall
do
you
honor
in
our
dying
as
for
myself
i
shall
be
proud
to
face
the
bullets
or
even
the
rope
in
company
with
you
athos
for
you
have
never
seemed
to
me
so
grand
as
you
are
d
artagnan
said
nothing
but
after
having
gnawed
the
flower
stalk
he
began
to
bite
his
nails
at
last
do
you
imagine
he
resumed
that
they
mean
to
kill
you
and
wherefore
should
they
do
so
what
interest
have
they
in
your
death
moreover
you
are
our
fool
cried
aramis
knowest
thou
not
then
mordaunt
i
have
but
exchanged
with
him
one
look
yet
that
look
convinced
me
that
we
were
the
truth
is
i
m
very
sorry
that
i
did
not
strangle
him
as
you
advised
me
said
porthos
eh
i
make
no
account
of
the
harm
mordaunt
can
do
cried
d
artagnan
cap
de
diou
if
he
troubles
me
too
much
i
will
crush
him
the
insect
do
not
fly
then
it
is
useless
for
i
swear
to
you
that
you
are
as
safe
here
as
you
were
twenty
years
ago
you
athos
in
the
rue
ferou
and
you
aramis
in
the
rue
de
stop
cried
athos
extending
his
hand
to
one
of
the
grated
windows
by
which
the
room
was
lighted
you
will
soon
know
what
to
expect
for
here
he
who
in
fact
looking
at
the
place
to
which
athos
pointed
d
artagnan
saw
a
cavalier
coming
toward
the
house
at
full
gallop
it
was
mordaunt
d
artagnan
rushed
out
of
the
room
porthos
wanted
to
follow
him
stay
said
d
artagnan
and
do
not
come
till
you
hear
me
drum
my
fingers
on
the
when
mordaunt
arrived
opposite
the
house
he
saw
d
artagnan
on
the
threshold
and
the
soldiers
lying
on
the
grass
here
and
there
with
their
arms
halloo
he
cried
are
the
prisoners
still
there
yes
sir
answered
the
sergeant
uncovering
tis
well
order
four
men
to
conduct
them
to
my
four
men
prepared
to
do
so
what
is
it
said
d
artagnan
with
that
jeering
manner
which
our
readers
have
so
often
observed
in
him
since
they
made
his
acquaintance
what
is
the
matter
if
you
please
sir
replied
mordaunt
i
have
ordered
the
two
prisoners
we
made
this
morning
to
be
conducted
to
my
wherefore
sir
excuse
curiosity
but
i
wish
to
be
enlightened
on
the
because
these
prisoners
sir
are
at
my
disposal
and
i
choose
to
dispose
of
them
as
i
allow
me
allow
me
sir
said
d
artagnan
to
observe
you
are
in
error
the
prisoners
belong
to
those
who
take
them
and
not
to
those
who
only
saw
them
taken
you
might
have
taken
lord
winter
who
tis
said
was
your
uncle
prisoner
but
you
preferred
killing
him
tis
well
we
that
is
monsieur
du
vallon
and
i
could
have
killed
our
prisoners
we
preferred
taking
mordaunt
s
very
lips
grew
white
with
rage
d
artagnan
now
saw
that
affairs
were
growing
worse
and
he
beat
the
guard
s
march
upon
the
door
at
the
first
beat
porthos
rushed
out
and
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
this
movement
was
observed
by
mordaunt
sir
he
thus
addressed
d
artagnan
your
resistance
is
useless
these
prisoners
have
just
been
given
me
by
my
illustrious
patron
oliver
these
words
struck
d
artagnan
like
a
thunderbolt
the
blood
mounted
to
his
temples
his
eyes
became
dim
he
saw
from
what
fountainhead
the
ferocious
hopes
of
the
young
man
arose
and
he
put
his
hand
to
the
hilt
of
his
sword
as
for
porthos
he
looked
inquiringly
at
d
artagnan
this
look
of
porthos
s
made
the
gascon
regret
that
he
had
summoned
the
brute
force
of
his
friend
to
aid
him
in
an
affair
which
seemed
to
require
chiefly
cunning
violence
he
said
to
himself
would
spoil
all
d
artagnan
my
friend
prove
to
this
young
serpent
that
thou
art
not
only
stronger
but
more
subtle
than
he
ah
he
said
making
a
low
bow
why
did
you
not
begin
by
saying
that
monsieur
mordaunt
what
are
you
sent
by
general
oliver
cromwell
the
most
illustrious
captain
of
the
age
i
have
this
instant
left
him
replied
mordaunt
alighting
in
order
to
give
his
horse
to
a
soldier
to
hold
why
did
you
not
say
so
at
once
my
dear
sir
all
england
is
with
cromwell
and
since
you
ask
for
my
prisoners
i
bend
sir
to
your
wishes
they
are
yours
take
mordaunt
delighted
advanced
porthos
looking
at
d
artagnan
with
astonishment
then
d
artagnan
trod
on
his
foot
and
porthos
began
to
understand
that
this
was
merely
acting
mordaunt
put
his
foot
on
the
first
step
of
the
door
and
with
his
hat
in
hand
prepared
to
pass
by
the
two
friends
motioning
to
the
four
men
to
follow
him
but
pardon
said
d
artagnan
with
the
most
charming
smile
and
putting
his
hand
on
the
young
man
s
shoulder
if
the
illustrious
general
oliver
cromwell
has
disposed
of
our
prisoners
in
your
favour
he
has
of
course
made
that
act
of
donation
in
mordaunt
stopped
short
he
has
given
you
some
little
writing
for
me
the
least
bit
of
paper
which
may
show
that
you
come
in
his
name
be
pleased
to
give
me
that
scrap
of
paper
so
that
i
may
justify
by
a
pretext
at
least
my
abandoning
my
countrymen
otherwise
you
see
although
i
am
sure
that
general
oliver
cromwell
can
intend
them
no
harm
it
would
have
a
bad
mordaunt
recoiled
he
felt
the
blow
and
discharged
a
terrible
look
at
d
artagnan
who
responded
by
the
most
amiable
expression
that
ever
graced
a
human
countenance
when
i
tell
you
a
thing
sir
said
mordaunt
you
insult
me
by
doubting
i
cried
d
artagnan
i
doubt
what
you
say
god
keep
me
from
it
my
dear
monsieur
mordaunt
on
the
contrary
i
take
you
to
be
a
worthy
and
accomplished
gentleman
and
then
sir
do
you
wish
me
to
speak
freely
to
you
continued
d
artagnan
with
his
frank
expression
speak
out
sir
said
mordaunt
monsieur
du
vallon
yonder
is
rich
and
has
forty
thousand
francs
yearly
so
he
does
not
care
about
money
i
do
not
speak
for
him
but
for
well
sir
what
more
well
i
i
m
not
rich
in
gascony
tis
no
dishonor
sir
nobody
is
rich
and
henry
of
glorious
memory
who
was
the
king
of
the
gascons
as
his
majesty
philip
iv
is
the
king
of
the
spaniards
never
had
a
penny
in
his
go
on
sir
i
see
what
you
wish
to
get
at
and
if
it
is
simply
what
i
think
that
stops
you
i
can
obviate
the
ah
i
knew
well
said
the
gascon
that
you
were
a
man
of
talent
well
here
s
the
case
here
s
where
the
saddle
hurts
me
as
we
french
say
i
am
an
officer
of
fortune
nothing
else
i
have
nothing
but
what
my
sword
brings
me
in
that
is
to
say
more
blows
than
banknotes
now
on
taking
prisoners
this
morning
two
frenchmen
who
seemed
to
me
of
high
birth
in
short
two
knights
of
the
garter
i
said
to
myself
my
fortune
is
made
i
say
two
because
in
such
circumstances
monsieur
du
vallon
who
is
rich
always
gives
me
his
mordaunt
completely
deceived
by
the
wordy
civility
of
d
artagnan
smiled
like
a
man
who
understands
perfectly
the
reasons
given
him
and
said
i
shall
have
the
order
signed
directly
sir
and
with
it
two
thousand
pistoles
meanwhile
let
me
take
these
men
no
replied
d
artagnan
what
signifies
a
delay
of
half
an
hour
i
am
a
man
of
order
sir
let
us
do
things
in
nevertheless
replied
mordaunt
i
could
compel
you
i
command
ah
sir
said
d
artagnan
i
see
that
although
we
have
had
the
honor
of
traveling
in
your
company
you
do
not
know
us
we
are
gentlemen
we
are
both
of
us
able
to
kill
you
and
your
eight
men
we
two
only
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
be
obstinate
for
when
others
are
obstinate
i
am
obstinate
likewise
and
then
i
become
ferocious
and
headstrong
and
there
s
my
friend
who
is
even
more
headstrong
and
ferocious
than
myself
besides
we
are
sent
here
by
cardinal
mazarin
and
at
this
moment
represent
both
the
king
and
the
cardinal
and
are
therefore
as
ambassadors
able
to
act
with
impunity
a
thing
that
general
oliver
cromwell
who
is
assuredly
as
great
a
politician
as
he
is
a
general
is
quite
the
man
to
understand
ask
him
then
for
the
written
order
what
will
that
cost
you
my
dear
monsieur
mordaunt
yes
the
written
order
said
porthos
who
now
began
to
comprehend
what
d
artagnan
was
aiming
at
we
ask
only
for
however
inclined
mordaunt
was
to
have
recourse
to
violence
he
understood
the
reasons
d
artagnan
had
given
him
besides
completely
ignorant
of
the
friendship
which
existed
between
the
four
frenchmen
all
his
uneasiness
disappeared
when
he
heard
of
the
plausible
motive
of
the
ransom
he
decided
therefore
not
only
to
fetch
the
order
but
the
two
thousand
pistoles
at
which
he
estimated
the
prisoners
he
therefore
mounted
his
horse
and
disappeared
good
thought
d
artagnan
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
go
to
the
tent
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
return
it
is
more
than
we
then
turning
without
the
least
change
of
countenance
to
porthos
he
said
looking
him
full
in
the
face
friend
porthos
listen
to
this
first
not
a
syllable
to
either
of
our
friends
of
what
you
have
heard
it
is
unnecessary
for
them
to
know
the
service
we
are
going
to
render
very
well
i
go
to
the
stable
you
will
find
mousqueton
there
saddle
your
horses
put
your
pistols
in
your
take
out
the
horses
and
lead
them
to
the
street
below
this
so
that
there
will
be
nothing
to
do
but
mount
them
all
the
rest
is
my
porthos
made
no
remark
but
obeyed
with
the
sublime
confidence
he
had
in
his
friend
i
go
he
said
only
shall
i
enter
the
chamber
where
those
gentlemen
are
no
it
is
not
worth
well
do
me
the
kindness
to
take
my
purse
which
i
left
on
the
all
he
then
proceeded
with
his
usual
calm
gait
to
the
stable
and
went
into
the
very
midst
of
the
soldiery
who
foreigner
as
he
was
could
not
help
admiring
his
height
and
the
enormous
strength
of
his
great
limbs
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
met
mousqueton
and
took
him
with
him
d
artagnan
meantime
went
into
the
house
whistling
a
tune
which
he
had
begun
before
porthos
went
away
my
dear
athos
i
have
reflected
on
your
arguments
and
i
am
convinced
i
am
sorry
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
this
matter
as
you
say
mazarin
is
a
knave
i
have
resolved
to
fly
with
you
not
a
word
be
ready
your
swords
are
in
the
corner
do
not
forget
them
they
are
in
many
circumstances
very
useful
there
is
porthos
s
purse
he
put
it
into
his
pocket
the
two
friends
were
perfectly
stupefied
well
pray
is
there
anything
to
be
so
surprised
at
he
said
i
was
blind
athos
has
made
me
see
that
s
all
come
the
two
friends
went
near
him
do
you
see
that
street
there
are
the
horses
go
out
by
the
door
turn
to
the
right
jump
into
your
saddles
all
will
be
right
don
t
be
uneasy
at
anything
except
mistaking
the
signal
that
will
be
the
signal
when
i
call
out
jesus
seigneur
but
give
us
your
word
that
you
will
come
too
d
artagnan
said
athos
i
swear
i
will
by
tis
settled
said
aramis
at
the
cry
jesus
seigneur
we
go
out
upset
all
that
stands
in
our
way
run
to
our
horses
jump
into
our
saddles
spur
them
is
that
all
see
aramis
as
i
have
told
you
d
artagnan
is
first
amongst
us
all
said
athos
very
true
replied
the
gascon
but
i
always
run
away
from
compliments
don
t
forget
the
signal
jesus
seigneur
and
he
went
out
as
he
came
in
whistling
the
air
the
soldiers
were
playing
or
sleeping
two
of
them
were
singing
in
a
corner
out
of
tune
the
psalm
on
the
rivers
of
d
artagnan
called
the
sergeant
my
dear
friend
general
cromwell
has
sent
monsieur
mordaunt
to
fetch
me
guard
the
prisoners
well
i
beg
of
the
sergeant
made
a
sign
as
much
as
to
say
he
did
not
understand
french
and
d
artagnan
tried
to
make
him
comprehend
by
signs
and
gestures
then
he
went
into
the
stable
he
found
the
five
horses
saddled
his
own
amongst
the
rest
each
of
you
take
a
horse
by
the
bridle
he
said
to
porthos
and
mousqueton
turn
to
the
left
so
that
athos
and
aramis
may
see
you
clearly
from
the
they
are
coming
then
said
porthos
in
a
you
didn
t
forget
my
purse
no
be
porthos
and
mousqueton
each
took
a
horse
by
the
bridle
and
proceeded
to
their
post
then
d
artagnan
being
alone
struck
a
light
and
lighted
a
small
bit
of
tinder
mounted
his
horse
and
stopped
at
the
door
in
the
midst
of
the
soldiers
there
caressing
as
he
pretended
the
animal
with
his
hand
he
put
this
bit
of
burning
tinder
in
his
ear
it
was
necessary
to
be
as
good
a
horseman
as
he
was
to
risk
such
a
scheme
for
no
sooner
had
the
animal
felt
the
burning
tinder
than
he
uttered
a
cry
of
pain
and
reared
and
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
mad
the
soldiers
whom
he
was
nearly
trampling
ran
away
help
help
cried
d
artagnan
stop
my
horse
has
the
in
an
instant
the
horse
s
eyes
grew
bloodshot
and
he
was
white
with
foam
help
cried
d
artagnan
what
will
you
let
me
be
killed
jesus
seigneur
no
sooner
had
he
uttered
this
cry
than
the
door
opened
and
athos
and
aramis
rushed
out
the
coast
owing
to
the
gascon
s
stratagem
was
clear
the
prisoners
are
escaping
the
prisoners
are
escaping
cried
the
sergeant
stop
stop
cried
d
artagnan
giving
rein
to
his
famous
steed
who
darting
forth
overturned
several
men
stop
stop
cried
the
soldiers
and
ran
for
their
arms
but
the
prisoners
were
in
their
saddles
and
lost
no
time
hastening
to
the
nearest
gate
in
the
middle
of
the
street
they
saw
grimaud
and
blaisois
who
were
coming
to
find
their
masters
with
one
wave
of
his
hand
athos
made
grimaud
who
followed
the
little
troop
understand
everything
and
they
passed
on
like
a
whirlwind
d
artagnan
still
directing
them
from
behind
with
his
voice
they
passed
through
the
gate
like
apparitions
without
the
guards
thinking
of
detaining
them
and
reached
the
open
country
all
this
time
the
soldiers
were
calling
out
stop
stop
and
the
sergeant
who
began
to
see
that
he
was
the
victim
of
an
artifice
was
almost
in
a
frenzy
of
despair
whilst
all
this
was
going
on
a
cavalier
in
full
gallop
was
seen
approaching
it
was
mordaunt
with
the
order
in
his
hand
the
prisoners
he
exclaimed
jumping
off
his
horse
the
sergeant
had
not
the
courage
to
reply
he
showed
him
the
open
door
the
empty
room
mordaunt
darted
to
the
steps
understood
all
uttered
a
cry
as
if
his
very
heart
was
pierced
and
fell
fainting
on
the
stone
steps
noble
natures
never
lose
courage
nor
good
stomachs
their
appetites
the
little
troop
without
looking
behind
them
or
exchanging
a
word
fled
at
a
rapid
gallop
fording
a
little
stream
of
which
none
of
them
knew
the
name
and
leaving
on
their
left
a
town
which
athos
declared
to
be
durham
at
last
they
came
in
sight
of
a
small
wood
and
spurring
their
horses
afresh
rode
in
its
direction
as
soon
as
they
had
disappeared
behind
a
green
curtain
sufficiently
thick
to
conceal
them
from
the
sight
of
any
one
who
might
be
in
pursuit
they
drew
up
to
hold
a
council
together
the
two
grooms
held
the
horses
that
they
might
take
a
little
rest
without
being
unsaddled
and
grimaud
was
posted
as
sentinel
come
first
of
all
said
athos
to
d
artagnan
my
friend
that
i
may
shake
hands
with
you
you
our
rescuer
you
the
true
hero
of
us
athos
is
right
you
have
my
adoration
said
aramis
in
his
turn
pressing
his
hand
to
what
are
you
not
equal
with
your
superior
intelligence
infallible
eye
your
arm
of
iron
and
your
enterprising
mind
now
said
the
gascon
that
is
all
well
i
accept
for
porthos
and
myself
everything
thanks
and
compliments
we
have
plenty
of
time
to
the
two
friends
recalled
by
d
artagnan
to
what
was
also
due
to
porthos
pressed
his
hand
in
their
turn
and
now
said
athos
it
is
not
our
plan
to
run
anywhere
and
like
madmen
but
we
must
map
up
our
campaign
what
shall
we
do
what
are
we
going
to
do
i
faith
it
is
not
very
difficult
to
tell
us
then
d
we
are
going
to
reach
the
nearest
seaport
unite
our
little
resources
hire
a
vessel
and
return
to
france
as
for
me
i
will
give
my
last
sou
for
it
life
is
the
greatest
treasure
and
speaking
candidly
ours
hangs
by
a
what
do
you
say
to
this
du
vallon
i
said
porthos
i
am
entirely
of
d
artagnan
s
opinion
this
is
a
beastly
country
this
you
are
quite
decided
then
to
leave
it
asked
athos
of
d
artagnan
egad
i
don
t
see
what
is
to
keep
me
a
glance
was
exchanged
between
athos
and
aramis
go
then
my
friends
said
the
former
sighing
how
go
then
exclaimed
d
artagnan
let
us
go
you
mean
no
my
friend
said
athos
you
must
leave
leave
you
cried
d
artagnan
quite
bewildered
at
this
unexpected
announcement
bah
said
porthos
why
separate
since
we
are
all
together
because
you
can
and
ought
to
return
to
france
your
mission
is
accomplished
but
ours
is
your
mission
is
not
accomplished
exclaimed
d
artagnan
looking
in
astonishment
at
athos
no
my
friend
replied
athos
in
his
gentle
but
decided
voice
we
came
here
to
defend
king
charles
we
have
but
ill
defended
him
it
remains
for
us
to
save
him
to
save
the
king
said
d
artagnan
looking
at
aramis
as
he
had
looked
at
athos
aramis
contented
himself
by
making
a
sign
with
his
head
d
artagnan
s
countenance
took
an
expression
of
the
deepest
compassion
he
began
to
think
he
had
to
do
with
madmen
you
can
not
be
speaking
seriously
athos
said
he
the
king
is
surrounded
by
an
army
which
is
conducting
him
to
london
this
army
is
commanded
by
a
butcher
or
the
son
of
a
butcher
it
matters
little
colonel
harrison
his
majesty
i
can
assure
you
will
be
tried
on
his
arrival
in
london
i
have
heard
enough
from
the
lips
of
oliver
cromwell
to
know
what
to
a
second
look
was
exchanged
between
athos
and
aramis
and
when
the
trial
is
ended
there
will
be
no
delay
in
putting
the
sentence
into
execution
continued
d
artagnan
and
to
what
penalty
do
you
think
the
king
will
be
condemned
asked
athos
the
penalty
of
death
i
greatly
fear
they
have
gone
too
far
for
him
to
pardon
them
and
there
is
nothing
left
to
them
but
one
thing
and
that
is
to
kill
him
have
you
never
heard
what
oliver
cromwell
said
when
he
came
to
paris
and
was
shown
the
dungeon
at
vincennes
where
monsieur
de
vendome
was
imprisoned
what
did
he
say
asked
porthos
princes
must
be
knocked
on
the
i
remember
it
said
athos
and
you
fancy
he
will
not
put
his
maxim
into
execution
now
that
he
has
got
hold
of
the
king
on
the
contrary
i
am
certain
he
will
do
so
but
then
that
is
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
not
abandon
the
august
head
so
athos
you
are
becoming
no
my
friend
athos
gently
replied
but
de
winter
sought
us
out
in
france
and
introduced
us
monsieur
d
herblay
and
myself
to
madame
henrietta
her
majesty
did
us
the
honor
to
ask
our
aid
for
her
husband
we
engaged
our
word
our
word
included
everything
it
was
our
strength
our
intelligence
our
life
in
short
that
we
promised
it
remains
now
for
us
to
keep
our
word
is
that
your
opinion
d
herblay
yes
said
aramis
we
have
then
continued
athos
we
have
another
reason
it
is
this
listen
in
france
at
this
moment
everything
is
poor
and
paltry
we
have
a
king
ten
years
old
who
doesn
t
yet
know
what
he
wants
we
have
a
queen
blinded
by
a
belated
passion
we
have
a
minister
who
governs
france
as
he
would
govern
a
great
farm
that
is
to
say
intent
only
on
turning
out
all
the
gold
he
can
by
the
exercise
of
italian
cunning
and
invention
we
have
princes
who
set
up
a
personal
and
egotistic
opposition
who
will
draw
from
mazarin
s
hands
only
a
few
ingots
of
gold
or
some
shreds
of
power
granted
as
bribes
i
have
served
them
without
enthusiasm
god
knows
that
i
estimated
them
at
their
real
value
and
that
they
are
not
high
in
my
esteem
but
on
principle
i
am
engaged
in
a
different
affair
i
have
encountered
misfortune
in
a
high
place
a
royal
misfortune
a
european
misfortune
i
attach
myself
to
it
if
we
can
succeed
in
saving
the
king
it
will
be
good
if
we
die
for
him
it
will
be
so
you
know
beforehand
you
must
perish
said
d
artagnan
we
fear
so
and
our
only
regret
is
to
die
so
far
from
both
of
what
will
you
do
in
a
foreign
land
an
enemy
s
country
i
traveled
in
england
when
i
was
young
i
speak
english
like
an
englishman
and
aramis
too
knows
something
of
the
language
ah
if
we
had
you
my
friends
with
you
d
artagnan
with
you
porthos
all
four
reunited
for
the
first
time
for
twenty
years
we
would
dare
not
only
england
but
the
three
kingdoms
put
together
and
did
you
promise
the
queen
resumed
d
artagnan
petulantly
to
storm
the
tower
of
london
to
kill
a
hundred
thousand
soldiers
to
fight
victoriously
against
the
wishes
of
the
nation
and
the
ambition
of
a
man
and
when
that
man
is
cromwell
do
not
exaggerate
your
duty
in
heaven
s
name
my
dear
athos
do
not
make
a
useless
sacrifice
when
i
see
you
merely
you
look
like
a
reasonable
being
when
you
speak
i
seem
to
have
to
do
with
a
madman
come
porthos
join
me
say
frankly
what
do
you
think
of
this
business
nothing
good
replied
porthos
come
continued
d
artagnan
who
irritated
that
instead
of
listening
to
him
athos
seemed
to
be
attending
to
his
own
thoughts
you
have
never
found
yourself
the
worse
for
my
advice
well
then
believe
me
athos
your
mission
is
ended
and
ended
nobly
return
to
france
with
friend
said
athos
our
resolution
is
then
you
have
some
other
motive
unknown
to
us
athos
smiled
and
d
artagnan
struck
his
hands
together
in
anger
and
muttered
the
most
convincing
reasons
that
he
could
discover
but
to
all
these
reasons
athos
contented
himself
by
replying
with
a
calm
sweet
smile
and
aramis
by
nodding
his
head
very
well
cried
d
artagnan
at
last
furious
very
well
since
you
wish
it
let
us
leave
our
bones
in
this
beggarly
land
where
it
is
always
cold
where
fine
weather
is
a
fog
fog
is
rain
and
rain
a
deluge
where
the
sun
represents
the
moon
and
the
moon
a
cream
cheese
in
truth
whether
we
die
here
or
elsewhere
matters
little
since
we
must
only
reflect
my
good
fellow
said
athos
it
is
but
dying
rather
pooh
a
little
sooner
or
a
little
later
it
isn
t
worth
quarreling
if
i
am
astonished
at
anything
remarked
porthos
sententiously
it
is
that
it
has
not
already
oh
it
will
happen
you
may
be
sure
said
d
artagnan
so
it
is
agreed
and
if
porthos
makes
no
objection
i
said
porthos
i
will
do
whatever
you
please
and
besides
i
think
what
the
comte
de
la
fere
said
just
now
is
very
but
your
future
career
d
artagnan
your
ambition
porthos
our
future
our
ambition
replied
d
artagnan
with
feverish
volubility
need
we
think
of
that
since
we
are
to
save
the
king
the
king
saved
we
shall
assemble
our
friends
together
we
will
head
the
puritans
reconquer
england
we
shall
london
place
him
securely
on
his
throne
and
he
will
make
us
dukes
and
peers
said
porthos
whose
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
at
this
imaginary
prospect
or
he
will
forget
us
added
d
artagnan
oh
said
porthos
well
that
has
happened
friend
porthos
it
seems
to
me
that
we
once
rendered
anne
of
austria
a
service
not
much
less
than
that
which
we
are
trying
to
perform
for
charles
but
none
the
less
anne
of
austria
has
forgotten
us
for
twenty
well
in
spite
of
that
d
artagnan
said
athos
you
are
not
sorry
that
you
were
useful
to
her
no
indeed
said
d
artagnan
i
admit
even
that
in
my
darkest
moments
i
find
consolation
in
that
you
see
then
d
artagnan
though
princes
often
are
ungrateful
god
never
athos
said
d
artagnan
i
believe
that
were
you
to
fall
in
with
the
devil
you
would
conduct
yourself
so
well
that
you
would
take
him
with
you
to
so
then
said
athos
offering
his
hand
to
d
artagnan
tis
settled
replied
d
artagnan
i
find
england
a
charming
country
and
i
stay
but
on
one
condition
what
is
it
that
i
am
not
forced
to
learn
well
now
said
athos
triumphantly
i
swear
to
you
my
friend
by
the
god
who
hears
us
i
believe
that
there
is
a
power
watching
over
us
and
that
we
shall
all
four
see
france
so
be
it
said
d
artagnan
but
i
i
confess
i
have
a
contrary
our
good
d
artagnan
said
aramis
represents
among
us
the
opposition
in
parliament
which
always
says
no
and
always
does
but
in
the
meantime
saves
the
country
added
athos
well
now
that
everything
is
decided
cried
porthos
rubbing
his
hands
suppose
we
think
of
dinner
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
most
critical
positions
of
our
lives
we
have
always
oh
yes
speak
of
dinner
in
a
country
where
for
a
feast
they
eat
boiled
mutton
and
as
a
treat
drink
beer
what
the
devil
did
you
come
to
such
a
country
for
athos
but
i
forgot
added
the
gascon
smiling
pardon
i
forgot
you
are
no
longer
athos
but
never
mind
let
us
hear
your
plan
for
dinner
my
plan
yes
have
you
a
plan
no
i
am
hungry
that
is
pardieu
if
that
is
all
i
am
hungry
too
but
it
is
not
everything
to
be
hungry
one
must
find
something
to
eat
unless
we
browse
on
the
grass
like
our
horses
ah
exclaimed
aramis
who
was
not
quite
so
indifferent
to
the
good
things
of
the
earth
as
athos
do
you
remember
when
we
were
at
parpaillot
the
beautiful
oysters
that
we
ate
and
the
legs
of
mutton
of
the
salt
marshes
said
porthos
smacking
his
lips
but
suggested
d
artagnan
have
we
not
our
friend
mousqueton
who
managed
for
us
so
well
at
chantilly
porthos
yes
said
porthos
we
have
mousqueton
but
since
he
has
been
steward
he
has
become
very
heavy
never
mind
let
us
call
him
and
to
make
sure
that
he
will
reply
agreeably
here
mouston
cried
porthos
mouston
appeared
with
a
most
piteous
face
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
mouston
asked
d
artagnan
are
you
ill
sir
i
am
very
hungry
replied
mouston
well
it
is
just
for
that
reason
that
we
have
called
you
my
good
mouston
could
you
not
procure
us
a
few
of
those
nice
little
rabbits
and
some
of
those
delicious
partridges
of
which
you
used
to
make
fricassees
at
the
hotel
faith
i
do
not
remember
the
name
of
the
at
the
hotel
of
said
porthos
by
my
faith
nor
do
i
remember
it
it
does
not
matter
and
a
few
of
those
bottles
of
old
burgundy
wine
which
cured
your
master
so
quickly
of
his
sprain
alas
sir
said
mousqueton
i
much
fear
that
what
you
ask
for
are
very
rare
things
in
this
detestable
and
barren
country
and
i
think
we
should
do
better
to
go
and
seek
hospitality
from
the
owner
of
a
little
house
we
see
on
the
fringe
of
the
how
is
there
a
house
in
the
neighborhood
asked
d
artagnan
yes
sir
replied
mousqueton
well
let
us
as
you
say
go
and
ask
a
dinner
from
the
master
of
that
house
what
is
your
opinion
gentlemen
and
does
not
mouston
s
suggestion
appear
to
you
full
of
sense
oh
said
aramis
suppose
the
master
is
a
puritan
so
much
the
better
mordioux
replied
d
artagnan
if
he
is
a
puritan
we
will
inform
him
of
the
capture
of
the
king
and
in
honor
of
the
news
he
will
kill
for
us
his
fatted
but
if
he
should
be
a
cavalier
said
porthos
in
that
case
we
will
put
on
an
air
of
mourning
and
he
will
pluck
for
us
his
black
you
are
very
happy
exclaimed
athos
laughing
in
spite
of
himself
at
the
sally
of
the
irresistible
gascon
for
you
see
the
bright
side
of
what
would
you
have
said
d
artagnan
i
come
from
a
land
where
there
is
not
a
cloud
in
the
it
is
not
like
this
then
said
porthos
stretching
out
his
hand
to
assure
himself
whether
a
chill
sensation
he
felt
on
his
cheek
was
not
really
caused
by
a
drop
of
rain
come
come
said
d
artagnan
more
reason
why
we
should
start
on
our
journey
halloo
grimaud
grimaud
appeared
well
grimaud
my
friend
have
you
seen
anything
asked
the
gascon
nothing
replied
grimaud
those
idiots
cried
porthos
they
have
not
even
pursued
us
oh
if
we
had
been
in
their
place
yes
they
are
wrong
said
d
artagnan
i
would
willingly
have
said
two
words
to
mordaunt
in
this
little
desert
it
is
an
excellent
spot
for
bringing
down
a
man
in
proper
i
think
decidedly
observed
aramis
gentlemen
that
the
son
hasn
t
his
mother
s
what
my
good
fellow
replied
athos
wait
awhile
we
have
scarcely
left
him
two
hours
ago
he
does
not
know
yet
in
what
direction
we
came
nor
where
we
are
we
may
say
that
he
is
not
equal
to
his
mother
when
we
put
foot
in
france
if
we
are
not
poisoned
or
killed
before
meanwhile
let
us
dine
suggested
porthos
i
faith
yes
said
athos
for
i
am
look
out
for
the
black
fowls
cried
aramis
and
the
four
friends
guided
by
mousqueton
took
up
the
way
toward
the
house
already
almost
restored
to
their
former
gayety
for
they
were
now
as
athos
had
said
all
four
once
more
united
and
of
single
mind
respect
to
fallen
majesty
as
our
fugitives
approached
the
house
they
found
the
ground
cut
up
as
if
a
considerable
body
of
horsemen
had
preceded
them
before
the
door
the
traces
were
yet
more
apparent
these
horsemen
whoever
they
might
be
had
halted
there
egad
cried
d
artagnan
it
s
quite
clear
that
the
king
and
his
escort
have
been
by
the
devil
said
porthos
in
that
case
they
have
eaten
bah
said
d
artagnan
they
will
have
left
a
chicken
at
he
dismounted
and
knocked
on
the
door
there
was
no
response
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
found
the
first
room
empty
and
deserted
well
cried
porthos
i
can
see
nobody
said
d
artagnan
aha
what
blood
at
this
word
the
three
friends
leaped
from
their
horses
and
entered
d
artagnan
had
already
opened
the
door
of
the
second
room
and
from
the
expression
of
his
face
it
was
clear
that
he
there
beheld
some
extraordinary
object
the
three
friends
drew
near
and
discovered
a
young
man
stretched
on
the
ground
bathed
in
a
pool
of
blood
it
was
evident
that
he
had
attempted
to
regain
his
bed
but
had
not
had
sufficient
strength
to
do
so
athos
who
imagined
that
he
saw
him
move
was
the
first
to
go
up
to
him
well
inquired
d
artagnan
well
if
he
is
dead
said
athos
he
has
not
been
so
long
for
he
is
still
warm
but
no
his
heart
is
beating
ho
there
my
friend
the
wounded
man
heaved
a
sigh
d
artagnan
took
some
water
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
and
threw
it
upon
his
face
the
man
opened
his
eyes
made
an
effort
to
raise
his
head
and
fell
back
again
the
wound
was
in
the
top
of
his
skull
and
blood
was
flawing
copiously
aramis
dipped
a
cloth
into
some
water
and
applied
it
to
the
gash
again
the
wounded
man
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
in
astonishment
at
these
strangers
who
appeared
to
pity
him
you
are
among
friends
said
athos
in
english
so
cheer
up
and
tell
us
if
you
have
the
strength
to
do
so
what
has
happened
the
king
muttered
the
wounded
man
the
king
is
a
you
have
seen
him
asked
aramis
in
the
same
language
the
man
made
no
reply
make
your
mind
easy
resumed
athos
we
are
all
faithful
servants
of
his
is
what
you
tell
me
true
asked
the
wounded
man
on
our
honor
as
then
i
may
tell
you
all
i
am
brother
to
parry
his
majesty
s
athos
and
aramis
remembered
that
this
was
the
name
by
which
de
winter
had
called
the
man
they
had
found
in
the
passage
of
the
king
s
tent
we
know
him
said
athos
he
never
left
the
yes
that
is
he
well
he
thought
of
me
when
he
saw
the
king
was
taken
and
as
they
were
passing
before
the
house
he
begged
in
the
king
s
name
that
they
would
stop
as
the
king
was
hungry
they
brought
him
into
this
room
and
placed
sentinels
at
the
doors
and
windows
parry
knew
this
room
as
he
had
often
been
to
see
me
when
the
king
was
at
newcastle
he
knew
that
there
was
a
communicating
with
a
cellar
from
which
one
could
get
into
the
orchard
he
made
a
sign
which
i
understood
but
the
king
s
guards
must
have
noticed
it
and
held
themselves
on
guard
i
went
out
as
if
to
fetch
wood
passed
through
the
subterranean
passage
into
the
cellar
and
whilst
parry
was
gently
bolting
the
door
pushed
up
the
board
and
beckoned
to
the
king
to
follow
me
alas
he
would
not
but
parry
clasped
his
hands
and
implored
him
and
at
last
he
agreed
i
went
on
first
fortunately
the
king
was
a
few
steps
behind
me
when
suddenly
i
saw
something
rise
up
in
front
of
me
like
a
huge
shadow
i
wanted
to
cry
out
to
warn
the
king
but
that
very
moment
i
felt
a
blow
as
if
the
house
was
falling
on
my
head
and
fell
insensible
when
i
came
to
myself
again
i
was
stretched
in
the
same
place
i
dragged
myself
as
far
as
the
yard
the
king
and
his
escort
were
no
longer
there
i
spent
perhaps
an
hour
in
coming
from
the
yard
to
this
place
then
my
strength
gave
out
and
i
fainted
and
now
how
are
you
feeling
very
ill
replied
the
wounded
man
can
we
do
anything
for
you
asked
athos
help
to
put
me
on
the
bed
i
think
i
shall
feel
better
have
you
any
one
to
depend
on
for
assistance
my
wife
is
at
durham
and
may
return
at
any
moment
but
you
is
there
nothing
that
you
want
we
came
here
with
the
intention
of
asking
for
something
to
alas
they
have
taken
everything
there
isn
t
a
morsel
of
bread
in
the
you
hear
d
artagnan
said
athos
we
shall
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
our
it
is
all
one
to
me
now
said
d
artagnan
i
am
no
longer
faith
neither
am
i
said
porthos
they
carried
the
man
to
his
bed
and
called
grimaud
to
dress
the
wound
in
the
service
of
the
four
friends
grimaud
had
had
so
frequent
occasion
to
make
lint
and
bandages
that
he
had
become
something
of
a
surgeon
in
the
meantime
the
fugitives
had
returned
to
the
first
room
where
they
took
counsel
together
now
said
aramis
we
know
how
the
matter
stands
the
king
and
his
escort
have
gone
this
way
we
had
better
take
the
opposite
direction
eh
athos
did
not
reply
he
reflected
yes
said
porthos
let
us
take
the
opposite
direction
if
we
follow
the
escort
we
shall
find
everything
devoured
and
die
of
hunger
what
a
confounded
country
this
england
is
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
gone
without
my
dinner
for
ten
years
and
it
is
generally
my
best
what
do
you
think
d
artagnan
asked
athos
do
you
agree
with
aramis
not
at
all
said
d
artagnan
i
am
precisely
of
the
contrary
what
you
would
follow
the
escort
exclaimed
porthos
in
dismay
no
i
would
join
the
athos
s
eyes
shone
with
joy
join
the
escort
cried
aramis
let
d
artagnan
speak
said
athos
you
know
he
always
has
wise
advice
to
clearly
said
d
artagnan
we
must
go
where
they
will
not
look
for
us
now
they
will
be
far
from
looking
for
us
among
the
puritans
therefore
with
the
puritans
we
must
good
my
friend
good
said
athos
it
is
excellent
advice
i
was
about
to
give
it
when
you
anticipated
that
then
is
your
opinion
asked
aramis
yes
they
will
think
we
are
trying
to
leave
england
and
will
search
for
us
at
the
ports
meanwhile
we
shall
reach
london
with
the
king
once
in
london
we
shall
be
hard
to
find
without
considering
continued
athos
throwing
a
glance
at
aramis
the
chances
that
may
come
to
us
on
the
yes
said
aramis
i
i
however
do
not
understand
said
porthos
but
no
matter
since
it
is
at
the
same
time
the
opinion
of
d
artagnan
and
of
athos
it
must
be
the
but
said
aramis
shall
we
not
be
suspected
by
colonel
harrison
egad
cried
d
artagnan
he
s
just
the
man
i
count
upon
colonel
harrison
is
one
of
our
friends
we
have
met
him
twice
at
general
cromwell
s
he
knows
that
we
were
sent
from
france
by
monsieur
mazarin
he
will
consider
us
as
brothers
besides
is
he
not
a
butcher
s
son
well
then
porthos
shall
show
him
how
to
knock
down
an
ox
with
a
blow
of
the
fist
and
i
how
to
trip
up
a
bull
by
taking
him
by
the
horns
that
will
insure
his
athos
smiled
you
are
the
best
companion
that
i
know
d
artagnan
he
said
offering
his
hand
to
the
gascon
and
i
am
very
happy
in
having
found
you
again
my
dear
this
was
as
we
have
seen
the
term
which
athos
applied
to
d
artagnan
in
his
more
expansive
moods
at
this
moment
grimaud
came
in
he
had
stanched
the
wound
and
the
man
was
better
the
four
friends
took
leave
of
him
and
asked
if
they
could
deliver
any
message
for
him
to
his
brother
tell
him
answered
the
brave
man
to
let
the
king
know
that
they
have
not
killed
me
outright
however
insignificant
i
am
i
am
sure
that
his
majesty
is
concerned
for
me
and
blames
himself
for
my
be
easy
said
d
artagnan
he
will
know
all
before
the
little
troop
recommenced
their
march
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
perceived
a
considerable
body
of
horsemen
about
half
a
league
ahead
my
dear
friends
said
d
artagnan
give
your
swords
to
monsieur
mouston
who
will
return
them
to
you
at
the
proper
time
and
place
and
do
not
forget
you
are
our
it
was
not
long
before
they
joined
the
escort
the
king
was
riding
in
front
surrounded
by
troopers
and
when
he
saw
athos
and
aramis
a
glow
of
pleasure
lighted
his
pale
cheeks
d
artagnan
passed
to
the
head
of
the
column
and
leaving
his
friends
under
the
guard
of
porthos
went
straight
to
harrison
who
recognized
him
as
having
met
him
at
cromwell
s
and
received
him
as
politely
as
a
man
of
his
breeding
and
disposition
could
it
turned
out
as
d
artagnan
had
foreseen
the
colonel
neither
had
nor
could
have
any
suspicion
they
halted
for
the
king
to
dine
this
time
however
due
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
any
attempt
at
escape
in
the
large
room
of
the
hotel
a
small
table
was
placed
for
him
and
a
large
one
for
the
officers
will
you
dine
with
me
asked
harrison
of
d
artagnan
gad
i
should
be
very
happy
but
i
have
my
companion
monsieur
du
vallon
and
the
two
prisoners
whom
i
can
not
leave
let
us
manage
it
better
have
a
table
set
for
us
in
a
corner
and
send
us
whatever
you
like
from
good
answered
harrison
the
matter
was
arranged
as
d
artagnan
had
suggested
and
when
he
returned
he
found
the
king
already
seated
at
his
little
table
where
parry
waited
on
him
harrison
and
his
officers
sitting
together
at
another
table
and
in
a
corner
places
reserved
for
himself
and
his
companions
the
table
at
which
the
puritan
officers
were
seated
was
round
and
whether
by
chance
or
coarse
intention
harrison
sat
with
his
back
to
the
king
the
king
saw
the
four
gentlemen
come
in
but
appeared
to
take
no
notice
of
them
they
sat
down
in
such
a
manner
as
to
turn
their
backs
on
nobody
the
officers
table
and
that
of
the
king
were
opposite
to
them
i
faith
colonel
said
d
artagnan
we
are
very
grateful
for
your
gracious
invitation
for
without
you
we
ran
the
risk
of
going
without
dinner
as
we
have
without
breakfast
my
friend
here
monsieur
du
vallon
shares
my
gratitude
for
he
was
particularly
and
i
am
so
still
said
porthos
bowing
to
harrison
and
how
said
harrison
laughing
did
this
serious
calamity
of
going
without
breakfast
happen
to
you
in
a
very
simple
manner
colonel
said
d
artagnan
i
was
in
a
hurry
to
join
you
and
took
the
road
you
had
already
gone
by
you
can
understand
our
disappointment
when
arriving
at
a
pretty
little
house
on
the
skirts
of
a
wood
which
at
a
distance
had
quite
a
gay
appearance
with
its
red
roof
and
green
shutters
we
found
nothing
but
a
poor
wretch
bathed
ah
colonel
pay
my
respects
to
the
officer
of
yours
who
struck
that
yes
said
harrison
laughing
and
looking
over
at
one
of
the
officers
seated
at
his
table
when
groslow
undertakes
this
kind
of
thing
there
s
no
need
to
go
over
the
ground
a
second
ah
it
was
this
gentleman
said
d
artagnan
bowing
to
the
officer
i
am
sorry
he
does
not
speak
french
that
i
might
tender
him
my
i
am
ready
to
receive
and
return
them
sir
said
the
officer
in
pretty
good
french
for
i
resided
three
years
in
then
sir
allow
me
to
assure
you
that
your
blow
was
so
well
directed
that
you
have
nearly
killed
your
nearly
i
thought
i
had
quite
said
groslow
no
it
was
a
very
near
thing
but
he
is
not
as
he
said
this
d
artagnan
gave
a
glance
at
parry
who
was
standing
in
front
of
the
king
to
show
him
that
the
news
was
meant
for
him
the
king
too
who
had
listened
in
the
greatest
agony
now
breathed
again
hang
it
said
groslow
i
thought
i
had
succeeded
better
if
it
were
not
so
far
from
here
to
the
house
i
would
return
and
finish
and
you
would
do
well
if
you
are
afraid
of
his
recovering
for
you
know
if
a
wound
in
the
head
does
not
kill
at
once
it
is
cured
in
a
and
d
artagnan
threw
a
second
glance
toward
parry
on
whose
face
such
an
expression
of
joy
was
manifested
that
charles
stretched
out
his
hand
to
him
smiling
parry
bent
over
his
master
s
hand
and
kissed
it
respectfully
i
ve
a
great
desire
to
drink
the
king
s
health
said
athos
let
me
propose
it
then
said
d
artagnan
do
said
aramis
porthos
looked
at
d
artagnan
quite
amazed
at
the
resources
with
which
his
companion
s
gascon
sharpness
continually
supplied
him
d
artagnan
took
up
his
camp
tin
cup
filled
it
with
wine
and
arose
gentlemen
said
he
let
us
drink
to
him
who
presides
at
the
repast
here
s
to
our
colonel
and
let
him
know
that
we
are
always
at
his
commands
as
far
as
london
and
and
as
d
artagnan
as
he
spoke
looked
at
harrison
the
colonel
imagined
the
toast
was
for
himself
he
arose
and
bowed
to
the
four
friends
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
charles
while
harrison
emptied
his
glass
without
the
slightest
misgiving
the
king
in
return
looked
at
the
four
gentlemen
and
drank
with
a
smile
full
of
nobility
and
gratitude
come
gentlemen
cried
harrison
regardless
of
his
illustrious
captive
let
us
be
where
do
we
sleep
colonel
at
thirsk
replied
harrison
parry
said
the
king
rising
too
my
horse
i
desire
to
go
to
egad
said
d
artagnan
to
athos
your
king
has
thoroughly
taken
me
and
i
am
quite
at
his
if
what
you
say
is
sincere
replied
athos
he
will
never
reach
how
so
because
before
then
we
shall
have
carried
him
well
this
time
athos
said
d
artagnan
upon
my
word
you
are
have
you
some
plan
in
your
head
then
asked
aramis
ay
said
porthos
the
thing
would
not
be
impossible
with
a
good
i
have
none
said
athos
but
d
artagnan
will
discover
d
artagnan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
they
proceeded
d
artagnan
hits
on
a
plan
as
night
closed
in
they
arrived
at
thirsk
the
four
friends
appeared
to
be
entire
strangers
to
one
another
and
indifferent
to
the
precautions
taken
for
guarding
the
king
they
withdrew
to
a
private
house
and
as
they
had
reason
every
moment
to
fear
for
their
safety
they
occupied
but
one
room
and
provided
an
exit
which
might
be
useful
in
case
of
an
attack
the
lackeys
were
sent
to
their
several
posts
except
that
grimaud
lay
on
a
truss
of
straw
across
the
doorway
d
artagnan
was
thoughtful
and
seemed
for
the
moment
to
have
lost
his
usual
loquacity
porthos
who
could
never
see
anything
that
was
not
talked
to
him
as
usual
he
replied
in
monosyllables
and
athos
and
aramis
looked
significantly
at
one
another
next
morning
d
artagnan
was
the
first
to
rise
he
had
been
down
to
the
stables
already
taken
a
look
at
the
horses
and
given
the
necessary
orders
for
the
day
whilst
athos
and
aramis
were
still
in
bed
and
porthos
snoring
at
eight
o
clock
the
march
was
resumed
in
the
same
order
as
the
night
before
except
that
d
artagnan
left
his
friends
and
began
to
renew
the
acquaintance
which
he
had
already
struck
up
with
monsieur
groslow
groslow
whom
d
artagnan
s
praises
had
greatly
pleased
welcomed
him
with
a
gracious
smile
really
sir
d
artagnan
said
to
him
i
am
pleased
to
find
one
with
whom
to
talk
in
my
own
poor
tongue
my
friend
monsieur
du
vallon
is
of
a
very
melancholy
disposition
so
much
so
that
one
can
scarcely
get
three
words
out
of
him
all
day
as
for
our
two
prisoners
you
can
imagine
that
they
are
but
little
in
the
vein
for
they
are
hot
royalists
said
groslow
the
more
reason
they
should
be
sulky
with
us
for
having
captured
the
stuart
for
whom
i
hope
you
re
preparing
a
pretty
why
said
groslow
that
is
just
what
we
are
taking
him
to
london
and
you
never
by
any
chance
lose
sight
of
him
i
presume
i
should
think
not
indeed
you
see
he
has
a
truly
royal
ay
there
s
no
fear
in
the
daytime
but
at
night
we
redouble
our
and
what
method
of
surveillance
do
you
employ
eight
men
remain
constantly
in
his
the
deuce
he
is
well
guarded
then
but
besides
these
eight
men
you
doubtless
place
some
guard
outside
oh
no
just
think
what
would
you
have
two
men
without
arms
do
against
eight
armed
men
two
men
how
do
you
mean
yes
the
king
and
his
oh
then
they
allow
the
lackey
to
remain
with
him
yes
stuart
begged
this
favor
and
harrison
consented
under
pretense
that
he
s
a
king
it
appears
he
can
not
dress
or
undress
without
really
captain
said
d
artagnan
determined
to
continue
on
the
laudatory
tack
on
which
he
had
commenced
the
more
i
listen
to
you
the
more
surprised
i
am
at
the
easy
and
elegant
manner
in
which
you
speak
french
you
have
lived
three
years
in
paris
may
i
ask
what
you
were
doing
there
my
father
who
is
a
merchant
placed
me
with
his
correspondent
who
in
turn
sent
his
son
to
join
our
house
in
were
you
pleased
with
paris
sir
yes
but
you
are
much
in
want
of
a
revolution
like
our
own
not
against
your
king
who
is
a
mere
child
but
against
that
lazar
of
an
italian
the
queen
s
ah
i
am
quite
of
your
opinion
sir
and
we
should
soon
make
an
end
of
mazarin
if
we
had
only
a
dozen
officers
like
yourself
without
prejudices
vigilant
and
but
said
the
officer
i
thought
you
were
in
his
service
and
that
it
was
he
who
sent
you
to
general
that
is
to
say
i
am
in
the
king
s
service
and
that
knowing
he
wanted
to
send
some
one
to
england
i
solicited
the
appointment
so
great
was
my
desire
to
know
the
man
of
genius
who
now
governs
the
three
kingdoms
so
that
when
he
proposed
to
us
to
draw
our
swords
in
honor
of
old
england
you
see
how
we
snapped
up
the
yes
i
know
that
you
charged
by
the
side
of
on
his
right
and
left
sir
ah
there
s
another
brave
and
excellent
young
do
you
know
him
asked
the
officer
yes
very
well
monsieur
du
vallon
and
myself
came
from
france
with
it
appears
too
you
kept
him
waiting
a
long
time
at
what
would
you
have
i
was
like
you
and
had
a
king
in
aha
said
groslow
what
king
our
own
to
be
sure
the
little
one
louis
and
how
long
had
you
to
take
care
of
him
three
nights
and
by
my
troth
i
shall
always
remember
those
three
nights
with
a
certain
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
my
friends
officers
in
the
guards
and
mousquetaires
came
to
keep
me
company
and
we
passed
the
night
in
feasting
drinking
ah
true
said
the
englishman
with
a
sigh
you
frenchmen
are
born
boon
and
don
t
you
play
too
when
you
are
on
guard
never
said
the
englishman
in
that
case
you
must
be
horribly
bored
and
have
my
the
fact
is
i
look
to
my
turn
for
keeping
guard
with
horror
it
s
tiresome
work
to
keep
awake
a
whole
yes
but
with
a
jovial
partner
and
dice
and
guineas
clinking
on
the
cloth
the
night
passes
like
a
dream
you
don
t
like
playing
then
on
the
contrary
i
lansquenet
for
instance
devoted
to
it
i
used
to
play
almost
every
night
in
and
since
your
return
to
england
i
have
not
handled
a
card
or
i
sincerely
pity
you
said
d
artagnan
with
an
air
of
profound
compassion
look
here
said
the
englishman
well
i
am
on
in
stuart
s
room
yes
come
and
pass
the
night
with
impossible
impossible
why
so
i
play
with
monsieur
du
vallon
every
night
sometimes
we
don
t
go
to
bed
at
all
well
what
of
that
why
he
would
be
annoyed
if
i
did
not
play
with
does
he
play
well
i
have
seen
him
lose
as
much
as
two
thousand
pistoles
laughing
all
the
while
till
the
tears
rolled
bring
him
with
you
but
how
about
our
prisoners
let
your
servants
guard
yes
and
give
them
a
chance
of
escaping
said
d
artagnan
why
one
of
them
is
a
rich
lord
from
touraine
and
the
other
a
knight
of
malta
of
noble
family
we
have
arranged
the
ransom
of
each
of
them
on
arriving
in
france
we
are
reluctant
to
leave
for
a
single
moment
men
whom
our
lackeys
know
to
be
millionaires
it
is
true
we
plundered
them
a
little
when
we
took
them
and
i
will
even
confess
that
it
is
their
purse
that
monsieur
du
vallon
and
i
draw
on
in
our
nightly
play
still
they
may
have
concealed
some
precious
stone
some
valuable
diamond
so
that
we
are
like
those
misers
who
are
unable
to
absent
themselves
from
their
treasures
we
have
made
ourselves
the
constant
guardians
of
our
men
and
while
i
sleep
monsieur
du
vallon
ah
ah
said
groslow
you
see
then
why
i
must
decline
your
polite
invitation
which
is
especially
attractive
to
me
because
nothing
is
so
wearisome
as
to
play
night
after
night
with
the
same
person
the
chances
always
balance
and
at
the
month
s
end
nothing
is
gained
or
ah
said
groslow
sighing
there
is
something
still
more
wearisome
and
that
is
not
to
play
at
i
can
understand
that
said
d
artagnan
but
come
resumed
the
englishman
are
these
men
of
yours
dangerous
in
what
respect
are
they
capable
of
attempting
violence
d
artagnan
burst
out
laughing
at
the
idea
jesus
dieu
he
cried
one
of
them
is
trembling
with
fever
having
failed
to
adapt
himself
to
this
charming
country
of
yours
and
the
other
is
a
knight
of
malta
as
timid
as
a
young
girl
and
for
greater
security
we
have
taken
from
them
even
their
penknives
and
pocket
well
then
said
groslow
bring
them
with
but
really
said
d
artagnan
i
have
eight
men
on
guard
you
know
four
of
them
can
guard
the
king
and
the
other
four
your
prisoners
i
ll
manage
it
somehow
you
will
but
said
d
artagnan
now
i
think
of
it
what
is
to
prevent
our
beginning
nothing
at
all
said
groslow
just
so
come
to
us
this
evening
and
we
ll
return
your
capital
this
evening
with
you
at
stuart
s
the
next
day
with
you
see
that
with
a
little
forethought
one
can
lead
a
merry
life
anywhere
and
everywhere
said
d
artagnan
yes
with
frenchmen
and
frenchmen
like
and
monsieur
du
vallon
added
the
other
you
will
see
what
a
fellow
he
is
a
man
who
nearly
killed
mazarin
between
two
doors
they
employ
him
because
they
are
afraid
of
him
ah
there
he
is
calling
me
now
you
ll
excuse
me
i
they
exchanged
bows
and
d
artagnan
returned
to
his
companions
what
on
earth
can
you
have
been
saying
to
that
bulldog
exclaimed
porthos
my
dear
fellow
don
t
speak
like
that
of
monsieur
groslow
he
s
one
of
my
most
intimate
one
of
your
friends
cried
porthos
this
butcher
of
unarmed
farmers
hush
my
dear
porthos
monsieur
groslow
is
perhaps
rather
hasty
it
s
true
but
at
bottom
i
have
discovered
two
good
qualities
in
him
he
is
conceited
and
porthos
opened
his
eyes
in
amazement
athos
and
aramis
looked
at
one
another
and
smiled
they
knew
d
artagnan
and
knew
that
he
did
nothing
without
a
purpose
but
continued
d
artagnan
you
shall
judge
of
him
for
yourself
he
is
coming
to
play
with
us
this
oho
said
porthos
his
eyes
glistening
at
the
news
is
he
rich
he
s
the
son
of
one
of
the
wealthiest
merchants
in
and
knows
lansquenet
adores
basset
his
biribi
revels
in
good
said
porthos
we
shall
pass
an
agreeable
the
more
so
as
it
will
be
the
prelude
to
a
how
so
we
invite
him
to
play
he
has
invited
us
in
return
but
wait
we
stop
at
derby
and
if
there
is
a
bottle
of
wine
in
the
town
let
mousqueton
buy
it
it
will
be
well
to
prepare
a
light
supper
of
which
you
athos
and
aramis
are
not
to
partake
athos
because
i
told
him
you
had
a
fever
aramis
because
you
are
a
knight
of
malta
and
won
t
mix
with
fellows
like
us
do
you
understand
that
s
no
doubt
very
fine
said
porthos
but
deuce
take
me
if
i
understand
at
porthos
my
friend
you
know
i
am
descended
on
the
father
s
side
from
the
prophets
and
on
the
mother
s
from
the
sybils
and
that
i
only
speak
in
parables
and
riddles
let
those
who
have
ears
hear
and
those
who
have
eyes
see
i
can
tell
you
nothing
more
at
go
ahead
my
friend
said
athos
i
am
sure
that
whatever
you
do
is
well
and
you
aramis
are
you
of
that
opinion
entirely
so
my
dear
d
very
good
said
d
artagnan
here
indeed
are
true
believers
it
is
a
pleasure
to
work
miracles
before
them
they
are
not
like
that
unbelieving
porthos
who
must
see
and
touch
before
he
will
the
fact
is
said
porthos
with
an
air
of
finesse
i
am
rather
d
artagnan
gave
him
playful
buffet
on
the
shoulder
and
as
they
had
reached
the
station
where
they
were
to
breakfast
the
conversation
ended
there
at
five
in
the
evening
they
sent
mousqueton
on
before
as
agreed
upon
blaisois
went
with
him
in
crossing
the
principal
street
in
derby
the
four
friends
perceived
blaisois
standing
in
the
doorway
of
a
handsome
house
it
was
there
a
lodging
was
prepared
for
them
at
the
hour
agreed
upon
groslow
came
d
artagnan
received
him
as
he
would
have
done
a
friend
of
twenty
years
standing
porthos
scanned
him
from
head
to
foot
and
smiled
when
he
discovered
that
in
spite
of
the
blow
he
had
administered
to
parry
s
brother
he
was
not
nearly
so
strong
as
himself
athos
and
aramis
suppressed
as
well
as
they
could
the
disgust
they
felt
in
the
presence
of
such
coarseness
and
brutality
in
short
groslow
seemed
to
be
pleased
with
his
reception
athos
and
aramis
kept
themselves
to
their
role
at
midnight
they
withdrew
to
their
chamber
the
door
of
which
was
left
open
on
the
pretext
of
kindly
consideration
furthermore
d
artagnan
went
with
them
leaving
porthos
at
play
with
groslow
porthos
gained
fifty
pistoles
from
groslow
and
found
him
a
more
agreeable
companion
than
he
had
at
first
believed
him
to
be
as
to
groslow
he
promised
himself
that
on
the
following
evening
he
would
recover
from
d
artagnan
what
he
had
lost
to
porthos
and
on
leaving
reminded
the
gascon
of
his
appointment
the
next
day
was
spent
as
usual
d
artagnan
went
from
captain
groslow
to
colonel
harrison
and
from
colonel
harrison
to
his
friends
to
any
one
not
acquainted
with
him
he
seemed
to
be
in
his
normal
condition
but
to
his
friends
to
athos
and
aramis
was
apparent
a
certain
feverishness
in
his
gayety
what
is
he
contriving
asked
aramis
wait
said
athos
porthos
said
nothing
but
he
handled
in
his
pocket
the
fifty
pistoles
he
had
gained
from
groslow
with
a
degree
of
satisfaction
which
betrayed
itself
in
his
whole
bearing
arrived
at
ryston
d
artagnan
assembled
his
friends
his
face
had
lost
the
expression
of
careless
gayety
it
had
worn
like
a
mask
the
whole
day
athos
pinched
aramis
s
hand
the
moment
is
at
hand
he
said
yes
returned
d
artagnan
who
had
overheard
him
gentlemen
we
rescue
the
d
artagnan
said
athos
this
is
no
joke
i
trust
it
would
quite
cut
me
you
are
a
very
odd
man
athos
he
replied
to
doubt
me
thus
where
and
when
have
you
seen
me
trifle
with
a
friend
s
heart
and
a
king
s
life
i
have
told
you
and
i
repeat
it
that
we
rescue
charles
i
you
left
it
to
me
to
discover
the
means
and
i
have
done
porthos
looked
at
d
artagnan
with
an
expression
of
profound
admiration
aramis
smiled
as
one
who
hopes
athos
was
pale
and
trembled
in
every
limb
speak
said
athos
we
are
invited
replied
d
artagnan
to
pass
the
night
with
groslow
but
do
you
know
where
in
the
king
s
the
king
s
room
cried
athos
yes
gentlemen
in
the
king
s
room
groslow
is
on
guard
there
this
evening
and
to
pass
the
time
away
he
has
invited
us
to
keep
him
all
four
of
us
asked
athos
pardieu
certainly
all
four
we
couldn
t
leave
our
prisoners
could
we
ah
ah
said
aramis
tell
us
about
it
said
athos
palpitating
we
are
going
then
we
two
with
our
swords
you
with
daggers
we
four
have
got
to
master
these
eight
fools
and
their
stupid
captain
monsieur
porthos
what
do
you
say
to
that
i
say
it
is
easy
enough
answered
porthos
we
dress
the
king
in
groslow
s
clothes
mousqueton
grimaud
and
blaisois
have
our
horses
saddled
at
the
end
of
the
first
street
we
mount
them
and
before
daylight
are
twenty
leagues
athos
placed
his
two
hands
on
d
artagnan
s
shoulders
and
gazed
at
him
with
his
calm
sad
smile
i
declare
my
friend
said
he
that
there
is
not
a
creature
under
the
sky
who
equals
you
in
prowess
and
in
courage
whilst
we
thought
you
indifferent
to
our
sorrows
which
you
couldn
t
share
without
crime
you
alone
among
us
have
discovered
what
we
were
searching
for
in
vain
i
repeat
it
d
artagnan
you
are
the
best
one
among
us
i
bless
and
love
you
my
dear
and
to
think
that
i
couldn
t
find
that
out
said
porthos
scratching
his
head
it
is
so
but
said
aramis
if
i
understand
rightly
we
are
to
kill
them
all
eh
athos
shuddered
and
turned
pale
mordioux
answered
d
artagnan
i
believe
we
must
i
confess
i
can
discover
no
other
safe
and
satisfactory
let
us
see
said
aramis
how
are
we
to
act
i
have
arranged
two
plans
firstly
at
a
given
signal
which
shall
be
the
words
at
last
you
each
plunge
a
dagger
into
the
heart
of
the
soldier
nearest
to
you
we
on
our
side
do
the
same
that
will
be
four
killed
we
shall
then
be
matched
four
against
the
remaining
five
if
these
five
men
give
themselves
up
we
gag
them
if
they
resist
we
kill
them
if
by
chance
our
amphitryon
changes
his
mind
and
receives
only
porthos
and
myself
why
then
we
must
resort
to
heroic
measures
and
each
give
two
strokes
instead
of
one
it
will
take
a
little
longer
time
and
may
make
a
greater
disturbance
but
you
will
be
outside
with
swords
and
will
rush
in
at
the
proper
but
if
you
yourselves
should
be
struck
said
athos
impossible
said
d
artagnan
those
beer
drinkers
are
too
clumsy
and
awkward
besides
you
will
strike
at
the
throat
porthos
it
kills
as
quickly
and
prevents
all
very
good
said
porthos
it
will
be
a
nice
little
throat
horrible
horrible
exclaimed
athos
nonsense
said
d
artagnan
you
would
do
as
much
mr
humanity
in
a
battle
but
if
you
think
the
king
s
life
is
not
worth
what
it
must
cost
there
s
an
end
of
the
matter
and
i
send
to
groslow
to
say
i
am
no
you
are
right
said
athos
at
this
moment
a
soldier
entered
to
inform
them
that
groslow
was
waiting
for
them
where
asked
d
artagnan
in
the
room
of
the
english
nebuchadnezzar
replied
the
staunch
puritan
good
replied
athos
whose
blood
mounted
to
his
face
at
the
insult
offered
to
royalty
tell
the
captain
we
are
the
puritan
then
went
out
the
lackeys
had
been
ordered
to
saddle
eight
horses
and
to
wait
keeping
together
and
without
dismounting
at
the
corner
of
a
street
about
twenty
steps
from
the
house
where
the
king
was
lodged
it
was
nine
o
clock
in
the
evening
the
sentinels
had
been
relieved
at
eight
and
captain
groslow
had
been
on
guard
for
an
hour
d
artagnan
and
porthos
armed
with
their
swords
and
athos
and
aramis
each
carrying
a
concealed
poniard
approached
the
house
which
for
the
time
being
was
charles
stuart
s
prison
the
two
latter
followed
their
captors
in
the
humble
guise
of
captives
without
arms
od
s
bodikins
said
groslow
as
the
four
friends
entered
i
had
almost
given
you
d
artagnan
went
up
to
him
and
whispered
in
his
ear
the
fact
is
we
that
is
monsieur
du
vallon
and
i
hesitated
a
and
why
d
artagnan
looked
significantly
toward
athos
and
aramis
aha
said
groslow
on
account
of
political
opinions
no
matter
on
the
contrary
he
added
laughing
if
they
want
to
see
their
stuart
they
shall
see
him
are
we
to
pass
the
night
in
the
king
s
room
asked
d
artagnan
no
but
in
the
one
next
to
it
and
as
the
door
will
remain
open
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
have
you
provided
yourself
with
money
i
assure
you
i
intend
to
play
the
devil
s
game
d
artagnan
rattled
the
gold
in
his
pockets
very
good
said
groslow
and
opened
the
door
of
the
room
i
will
show
you
the
way
and
he
went
in
first
d
artagnan
turned
to
look
at
his
friends
porthos
was
perfectly
indifferent
athos
pale
but
resolute
aramis
was
wiping
a
slight
moisture
from
his
brow
the
eight
guards
were
at
their
posts
four
in
the
king
s
room
two
at
the
door
between
the
rooms
and
two
at
that
by
which
the
friends
had
entered
athos
smiled
when
he
saw
their
bare
swords
he
felt
it
was
no
longer
to
be
a
butchery
but
a
fight
and
he
resumed
his
usual
good
humor
charles
was
perceived
through
the
door
lying
dressed
upon
his
bed
at
the
head
of
which
parry
was
seated
reading
in
a
low
voice
a
chapter
from
the
bible
a
candle
of
coarse
tallow
on
a
black
table
lighted
up
the
handsome
and
resigned
face
of
the
king
and
that
of
his
faithful
retainer
far
less
calm
from
time
to
time
parry
stopped
thinking
the
king
whose
eyes
were
closed
was
really
asleep
but
charles
would
open
his
eyes
and
say
with
a
smile
go
on
my
good
parry
i
am
groslow
advanced
to
the
door
of
the
king
s
room
replaced
on
his
head
the
hat
he
had
taken
off
to
receive
his
guests
looked
for
a
moment
contemptuously
at
this
simple
yet
touching
scene
then
turning
to
d
artagnan
assumed
an
air
of
triumph
at
what
he
had
achieved
capital
cried
the
gascon
you
would
make
a
distinguished
and
do
you
think
asked
groslow
that
stuart
will
ever
escape
while
i
am
on
guard
no
to
be
sure
replied
d
artagnan
unless
forsooth
the
sky
rains
friends
upon
groslow
s
face
brightened
it
is
impossible
to
say
whether
charles
who
kept
his
eyes
constantly
closed
had
noticed
the
insolence
of
the
puritan
captain
but
the
moment
he
heard
the
clear
tone
of
d
artagnan
s
voice
his
eyelids
rose
in
spite
of
himself
parry
too
started
and
stopped
reading
what
are
you
thinking
about
said
the
king
go
on
my
good
parry
unless
you
are
parry
resumed
his
reading
on
a
table
in
the
next
room
were
lighted
candles
cards
two
and
dice
gentlemen
said
groslow
i
beg
you
will
take
your
places
i
will
sit
facing
stuart
whom
i
like
so
much
to
see
especially
where
he
now
is
and
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
opposite
to
athos
turned
red
with
rage
d
artagnan
frowned
at
him
that
s
it
said
d
artagnan
you
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
to
the
right
of
monsieur
groslow
you
chevalier
d
herblay
to
his
left
du
vallon
next
me
you
ll
bet
for
me
and
those
gentlemen
for
monsieur
by
this
arrangement
d
artagnan
could
nudge
porthos
with
his
knee
and
make
signs
with
his
eyes
to
athos
and
aramis
at
the
names
comte
de
la
fere
and
chevalier
d
herblay
charles
opened
his
eyes
and
raising
his
noble
head
in
spite
of
himself
threw
a
glance
at
all
the
actors
in
the
scene
at
that
moment
parry
turned
over
several
leaves
of
his
bible
and
read
with
a
loud
voice
this
verse
in
jeremiah
god
said
hear
ye
the
words
of
the
prophets
my
servants
whom
i
have
sent
unto
the
four
friends
exchanged
glances
the
words
that
parry
had
read
assured
them
that
their
presence
was
understood
by
the
king
and
was
assigned
to
its
real
motive
d
artagnan
s
eyes
sparkled
with
joy
you
asked
me
just
now
if
i
was
in
funds
said
d
artagnan
placing
some
twenty
pistoles
upon
the
table
well
in
my
turn
i
advise
you
to
keep
a
sharp
lookout
on
your
treasure
my
dear
monsieur
groslow
for
i
can
tell
you
we
shall
not
leave
this
without
robbing
you
of
not
without
my
defending
it
said
groslow
so
much
the
better
said
d
artagnan
fight
my
dear
captain
fight
you
know
or
you
don
t
know
that
that
is
what
we
ask
of
oh
yes
said
groslow
bursting
with
his
usual
coarse
laugh
i
know
you
frenchmen
want
nothing
but
cuts
and
charles
had
heard
and
understood
it
all
a
slight
color
mounted
to
his
cheeks
the
soldiers
then
saw
him
stretch
his
limbs
little
by
little
and
under
the
pretense
of
much
heat
throw
off
the
scotch
plaid
which
covered
him
athos
and
aramis
started
with
delight
to
find
that
the
king
was
lying
with
his
clothes
on
the
game
began
the
luck
had
turned
and
groslow
having
won
some
hundred
pistoles
was
in
the
merriest
possible
humor
porthos
who
had
lost
the
fifty
pistoles
he
had
won
the
night
before
and
thirty
more
besides
was
very
cross
and
questioned
d
artagnan
with
a
nudge
of
the
knee
as
to
whether
it
would
not
soon
be
time
to
change
the
game
athos
and
aramis
looked
at
him
inquiringly
but
d
artagnan
remained
impassible
it
struck
ten
they
heard
the
guard
going
its
rounds
how
many
rounds
do
they
make
a
night
asked
d
artagnan
drawing
more
pistoles
from
his
pocket
five
answered
groslow
one
every
two
d
artagnan
glanced
at
athos
and
aramis
and
for
the
first
time
replied
to
porthos
s
nudge
of
the
knee
by
a
nudge
responsive
meanwhile
the
soldiers
whose
duty
it
was
to
remain
in
the
king
s
room
attracted
by
that
love
of
play
so
powerful
in
all
men
had
stolen
little
by
little
toward
the
table
and
standing
on
tiptoe
lounged
watching
the
game
over
the
shoulders
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
those
on
the
other
side
had
followed
their
example
thus
favoring
the
views
of
the
four
friends
who
preferred
having
them
close
at
hand
to
chasing
them
about
the
chamber
the
two
sentinels
at
the
door
still
had
their
swords
unsheathed
but
they
were
leaning
on
them
while
they
watched
the
game
athos
seemed
to
grow
calm
as
the
critical
moment
approached
with
his
white
aristocratic
hands
he
played
with
the
louis
bending
and
straightening
them
again
as
if
they
were
made
of
pewter
aramis
less
fumbled
continually
with
his
hidden
poniard
porthos
impatient
at
his
continued
losses
kept
up
a
vigorous
play
with
his
knee
d
artagnan
turned
mechanically
looking
behind
him
and
between
the
figures
of
two
soldiers
he
could
see
parry
standing
up
and
charles
leaning
on
his
elbow
with
his
hands
clasped
and
apparently
offering
a
fervent
prayer
to
god
d
artagnan
saw
that
the
moment
was
come
he
darted
a
preparatory
glance
at
athos
and
aramis
who
slyly
pushed
their
chairs
a
little
back
so
as
to
leave
themselves
more
space
for
action
he
gave
porthos
a
second
nudge
of
the
knee
and
porthos
got
up
as
if
to
stretch
his
legs
and
took
care
at
the
same
time
to
ascertain
that
his
sword
could
be
drawn
smoothly
from
the
scabbard
hang
it
cried
d
artagnan
another
twenty
pistoles
lost
really
captain
groslow
you
are
too
much
in
fortune
s
way
this
can
t
last
and
he
drew
another
twenty
from
his
pocket
one
more
turn
captain
twenty
pistoles
on
one
throw
only
one
the
done
for
twenty
replied
groslow
and
he
turned
up
two
cards
as
usual
a
king
for
d
artagnan
and
an
ace
for
himself
a
king
said
d
artagnan
it
s
a
good
omen
master
groslow
look
out
for
the
and
in
spite
of
his
extraordinary
there
was
a
strange
vibration
in
the
gascon
s
voice
which
made
his
partner
start
groslow
began
turning
the
cards
one
after
another
if
he
turned
up
an
ace
first
he
won
if
a
king
he
lost
he
turned
up
a
king
at
last
cried
d
artagnan
at
this
word
athos
and
aramis
jumped
up
porthos
drew
back
a
step
daggers
and
swords
were
just
about
to
shine
when
suddenly
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
harrison
appeared
in
the
doorway
accompanied
by
a
man
enveloped
in
a
large
cloak
behind
this
man
could
be
seen
the
glistening
muskets
of
half
a
dozen
soldiers
groslow
jumped
up
ashamed
at
being
surprised
in
the
midst
of
wine
cards
and
dice
but
harrison
paid
not
the
least
attention
to
him
and
entering
the
king
s
room
followed
by
his
companion
charles
stuart
said
he
an
order
has
come
to
conduct
you
to
london
without
stopping
day
or
night
prepare
yourself
then
to
start
at
and
by
whom
is
this
order
given
asked
the
king
by
general
oliver
cromwell
and
here
is
mordaunt
who
has
brought
it
and
is
charged
with
its
mordaunt
muttered
the
four
friends
exchanging
glances
d
artagnan
swept
up
the
money
that
he
and
porthos
had
lost
and
buried
it
in
his
huge
pocket
athos
and
aramis
placed
themselves
behind
him
at
this
movement
mordaunt
turned
around
recognized
them
and
uttered
an
exclamation
of
savage
delight
i
m
afraid
we
are
prisoners
whispered
d
artagnan
to
his
friend
not
yet
replied
porthos
colonel
colonel
cried
mordaunt
you
are
betrayed
these
four
frenchmen
have
escaped
from
newcastle
and
no
doubt
want
to
carry
off
the
king
arrest
ah
my
young
man
said
d
artagnan
drawing
his
sword
that
is
an
order
sooner
given
than
executed
fly
friends
fly
he
added
whirling
his
sword
around
him
the
next
moment
he
darted
to
the
door
and
knocked
down
two
of
the
soldiers
who
guarded
it
before
they
had
time
to
cock
their
muskets
athos
and
aramis
followed
him
porthos
brought
up
the
rear
and
before
soldiers
officers
or
colonel
had
time
to
recover
their
surprise
all
four
were
in
the
street
fire
cried
mordaunt
fire
upon
them
three
or
four
shots
were
fired
but
with
no
other
result
than
to
show
the
four
fugitives
turning
the
corner
of
the
street
safe
and
sound
the
horses
were
at
the
place
fixed
upon
and
they
leaped
lightly
into
their
saddles
forward
cried
d
artagnan
and
spur
for
your
dear
lives
they
galloped
away
and
took
the
road
they
had
come
by
in
the
morning
namely
in
the
direction
toward
scotland
a
few
hundred
yards
beyond
the
town
d
artagnan
drew
rein
halt
he
cried
this
time
we
shall
be
pursued
we
must
let
them
leave
the
village
and
ride
after
us
on
the
northern
road
and
when
they
have
passed
we
will
take
the
opposite
there
was
a
stream
close
by
and
a
bridge
across
it
d
artagnan
led
his
horse
under
the
arch
of
the
bridge
the
others
followed
ten
minutes
later
they
heard
the
rapid
gallop
of
a
troop
of
horsemen
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
troop
passed
over
their
heads
london
as
soon
as
the
noise
of
the
hoofs
was
lost
in
the
distance
d
artagnan
remounted
the
bank
of
the
stream
and
scoured
the
plain
followed
by
his
three
friends
directing
their
course
as
well
as
they
could
guess
toward
london
this
time
said
d
artagnan
when
they
were
sufficiently
distant
to
proceed
at
a
trot
i
think
all
is
lost
and
we
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
to
reach
france
what
do
you
say
athos
to
that
proposition
isn
t
it
reasonable
yes
dear
friend
athos
replied
but
you
said
a
word
the
other
day
that
was
more
than
reasonable
it
was
noble
and
generous
you
said
let
us
die
here
i
recall
to
you
that
oh
said
porthos
death
is
nothing
it
isn
t
death
that
can
disquiet
us
since
we
don
t
know
what
it
is
what
troubles
me
is
the
idea
of
defeat
as
things
are
turning
out
i
foresee
that
we
must
give
battle
to
london
to
the
provinces
to
all
england
and
certainly
in
the
end
we
can
t
fail
to
be
we
ought
to
witness
this
great
tragedy
even
to
its
last
scene
said
athos
whatever
happens
let
us
not
leave
england
before
the
crisis
don
t
you
agree
with
me
aramis
entirely
my
dear
count
then
too
i
confess
i
should
not
be
sorry
to
come
across
mordaunt
again
it
appears
to
me
that
we
have
an
account
to
settle
with
him
and
that
it
is
not
our
custom
to
leave
a
place
without
paying
our
debts
of
this
kind
at
ah
that
s
another
thing
said
d
artagnan
and
i
should
not
mind
waiting
in
london
a
whole
year
for
a
chance
of
meeting
this
mordaunt
in
question
only
let
us
lodge
with
some
one
on
whom
we
can
count
for
i
imagine
just
now
that
noll
cromwell
would
not
be
inclined
to
trifle
with
us
athos
do
you
know
any
inn
in
the
whole
town
where
one
can
find
white
sheets
roast
beef
reasonably
cooked
and
wine
which
is
not
made
of
hops
and
gin
i
think
i
know
what
you
want
replied
athos
de
winter
took
us
to
the
house
of
a
spaniard
who
he
said
had
become
naturalized
as
an
englishman
by
the
guineas
of
his
new
compatriots
what
do
you
say
to
it
aramis
why
the
idea
of
taking
quarters
with
senor
perez
seems
to
me
very
reasonable
and
for
my
part
i
agree
to
it
we
will
invoke
the
remembrance
of
that
poor
de
winter
for
whom
he
seemed
to
have
a
great
regard
we
will
tell
him
that
we
have
come
as
amateurs
to
see
what
is
going
on
we
will
spend
with
him
a
guinea
each
per
day
and
i
think
that
by
taking
all
these
precautions
we
can
be
quite
you
forget
aramis
one
precaution
of
considerable
what
is
that
the
precaution
of
changing
our
changing
our
clothes
exclaimed
porthos
i
don
t
see
why
we
are
very
comfortable
in
those
we
to
prevent
recognition
said
d
artagnan
our
clothes
have
a
cut
which
would
proclaim
the
frenchman
at
first
sight
now
i
don
t
set
sufficient
store
on
the
cut
of
my
jerkin
to
risk
being
hung
at
tyburn
or
sent
for
change
of
scene
to
the
indies
i
shall
buy
a
suit
i
ve
remarked
that
your
puritans
revel
in
that
but
can
you
find
your
man
said
aramis
to
athos
oh
to
be
sure
yes
he
lives
at
the
bedford
tavern
greenhall
street
besides
i
can
find
my
way
about
the
city
with
my
eyes
i
wish
we
were
already
there
said
d
artagnan
and
my
advice
is
that
we
reach
london
before
daybreak
even
if
we
kill
our
come
on
then
said
athos
for
unless
i
am
mistaken
in
my
calculations
we
have
only
eight
or
ten
leagues
to
the
friends
urged
on
their
horses
and
arrived
in
fact
at
about
five
o
clock
in
the
morning
they
were
stopped
and
questioned
at
the
gate
by
which
they
sought
to
enter
the
city
but
athos
replied
in
excellent
english
that
they
had
been
sent
forward
by
colonel
harrison
to
announce
to
his
colleague
monsieur
bridge
the
approach
of
the
king
that
reply
led
to
several
questions
about
the
king
s
capture
and
athos
gave
details
so
precise
and
positive
that
if
the
gatekeepers
had
any
suspicions
they
vanished
completely
the
way
was
therefore
opened
to
the
four
friends
with
all
sorts
of
puritan
congratulations
athos
was
right
he
went
direct
to
the
bedford
tavern
and
the
host
who
recognized
him
was
delighted
to
see
him
again
with
such
a
numerous
and
promising
company
though
it
was
scarcely
daylight
our
four
travelers
found
the
town
in
a
great
bustle
owing
to
the
reported
approach
of
harrison
and
the
king
the
plan
of
changing
their
clothes
was
unanimously
adopted
the
landlord
sent
out
for
every
description
of
garment
as
if
he
wanted
to
fit
up
his
wardrobe
athos
chose
a
black
coat
which
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
respectable
citizen
aramis
not
wishing
to
part
with
his
sword
selected
a
cloak
of
a
military
cut
porthos
was
seduced
by
a
doublet
and
breeches
d
artagnan
who
had
fixed
on
his
color
beforehand
had
only
to
select
the
shade
and
looked
in
his
chestnut
suit
exactly
like
a
retired
sugar
dealer
now
said
d
artagnan
for
the
actual
man
we
must
cut
off
our
hair
that
the
populace
may
not
insult
us
as
we
no
longer
wear
the
sword
of
the
gentleman
we
may
as
well
have
the
head
of
the
puritan
this
as
you
know
is
the
important
point
of
distinction
between
the
covenanter
and
the
after
some
discussion
this
was
agreed
to
and
mousqueton
played
the
role
of
barber
we
look
hideous
said
athos
and
smack
of
the
puritan
to
a
frightful
extent
said
aramis
my
head
feels
actually
cold
said
porthos
as
for
me
i
feel
anxious
to
preach
a
sermon
said
d
artagnan
now
said
athos
that
we
can
not
even
recognize
one
another
and
have
therefore
no
fear
of
others
recognizing
us
let
us
go
and
see
the
king
s
they
had
not
been
long
in
the
crowd
before
loud
cries
announced
the
king
s
arrival
a
carriage
had
been
sent
to
meet
him
and
the
gigantic
porthos
who
stood
a
head
above
the
entire
rabble
soon
announced
that
he
saw
the
royal
equipage
approaching
d
artagnan
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
as
the
carriage
passed
saw
harrison
at
one
window
and
mordaunt
at
the
other
the
next
day
athos
leaning
out
of
his
window
which
looked
upon
the
most
populous
part
of
the
city
heard
the
act
of
parliament
which
summoned
the
charles
to
the
bar
publicly
cried
parliament
indeed
cried
athos
parliament
can
never
have
passed
such
an
act
as
at
this
moment
the
landlord
came
in
did
parliament
pass
this
act
athos
asked
of
him
in
english
yes
my
lord
the
pure
what
do
you
mean
by
the
pure
parliament
are
there
then
two
parliaments
my
friend
d
artagnan
interrupted
as
i
don
t
understand
english
and
we
all
understand
spanish
have
the
kindness
to
speak
to
us
in
that
language
which
since
it
is
your
own
you
must
find
pleasure
in
using
when
you
have
the
ah
excellent
said
aramis
as
to
porthos
all
his
attention
was
concentrated
on
the
allurements
of
the
breakfast
table
you
were
asking
then
said
the
host
in
spanish
i
asked
said
athos
in
the
same
language
if
there
are
two
parliaments
a
pure
and
an
impure
why
how
extraordinary
said
porthos
slowly
raising
his
head
and
looking
at
his
friends
with
an
air
of
astonishment
i
understand
english
then
i
understand
what
you
say
that
is
because
we
are
talking
spanish
my
dear
friend
said
athos
oh
the
devil
said
porthos
i
am
sorry
for
that
it
would
have
been
one
language
when
i
speak
of
the
pure
parliament
resumed
the
host
i
mean
the
one
which
colonel
bridge
has
ah
really
said
d
artagnan
these
people
are
very
ingenious
when
i
go
back
to
france
i
must
suggest
some
such
convenient
course
to
cardinal
mazarin
and
the
coadjutor
one
of
them
will
weed
the
parliament
in
the
name
of
the
court
and
the
other
in
the
name
of
the
people
and
then
there
won
t
be
any
parliament
at
and
who
is
this
colonel
bridge
asked
aramis
and
how
does
he
go
to
work
to
weed
the
parliament
colonel
bridge
replied
the
spaniard
is
a
retired
wagoner
a
man
of
much
sense
who
made
one
valuable
observation
whilst
driving
his
team
namely
that
where
there
happened
to
be
a
stone
on
the
road
it
was
much
easier
to
remove
the
stone
than
try
and
make
the
wheel
pass
over
it
now
of
two
hundred
and
members
who
composed
the
parliament
there
were
one
hundred
and
who
were
in
the
way
and
might
have
upset
his
political
wagon
he
took
them
up
just
as
he
formerly
used
to
take
up
the
stones
from
the
road
and
threw
them
out
of
the
neat
remarked
d
artagnan
very
and
all
these
one
hundred
and
were
royalists
asked
athos
without
doubt
senor
and
you
understand
that
they
would
have
saved
the
to
be
sure
said
porthos
with
majestic
common
sense
they
were
in
the
and
you
think
said
aramis
he
will
consent
to
appear
before
such
a
tribunal
he
will
be
forced
to
do
so
smiled
the
spaniard
now
athos
said
d
artagnan
do
you
begin
to
believe
that
it
s
a
ruined
cause
and
that
what
with
your
harrisons
joyces
bridges
and
cromwells
we
shall
never
get
the
upper
hand
the
king
will
be
delivered
at
the
tribunal
said
athos
the
very
silence
of
his
supporters
indicates
that
they
are
at
d
artagnan
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
said
aramis
if
they
dare
to
condemn
their
king
it
can
only
be
to
exile
or
d
artagnan
whistled
a
little
air
of
incredulity
we
shall
see
said
athos
for
we
shall
go
to
the
sittings
i
you
will
not
have
long
to
wait
said
the
landlord
they
begin
so
then
they
drew
up
the
indictments
before
the
king
was
taken
of
course
said
d
artagnan
they
began
the
day
he
was
and
you
know
said
aramis
that
it
was
our
friend
mordaunt
who
made
if
not
the
bargain
at
least
the
and
you
know
added
d
artagnan
that
whenever
i
catch
him
i
will
kill
him
this
and
i
too
exclaimed
porthos
and
i
too
added
aramis
touching
unanimity
cried
d
artagnan
which
well
becomes
good
citizens
like
us
let
us
take
a
turn
around
the
town
and
imbibe
a
little
yes
said
porthos
twill
be
at
least
a
little
change
from
the
trial
the
next
morning
king
charles
was
haled
by
a
strong
guard
before
the
high
court
which
was
to
judge
him
all
london
was
crowding
to
the
doors
of
the
house
the
throng
was
terrific
and
it
was
not
till
after
much
pushing
and
some
fighting
that
our
friends
reached
their
destination
when
they
did
so
they
found
the
three
lower
rows
of
benches
already
occupied
but
being
anxious
not
to
be
too
conspicuous
all
with
the
exception
of
porthos
who
had
a
fancy
to
display
his
red
doublet
were
quite
satisfied
with
their
places
the
more
so
as
chance
had
brought
them
to
the
centre
of
their
row
so
that
they
were
exactly
opposite
the
prepared
for
the
royal
prisoner
toward
eleven
o
clock
the
king
entered
the
hall
surrounded
by
guards
but
wearing
his
head
covered
and
with
a
calm
expression
turned
to
every
side
with
a
look
of
complete
assurance
as
if
he
were
there
to
preside
at
an
assembly
of
submissive
subjects
rather
than
to
meet
the
accusations
of
a
rebel
court
the
judges
proud
of
having
a
monarch
to
humiliate
evidently
prepared
to
enjoy
the
right
they
had
arrogated
to
themselves
and
sent
an
officer
to
inform
the
king
that
it
was
customary
for
the
accused
to
uncover
his
head
charles
without
replying
a
single
word
turned
his
head
in
another
direction
and
pulled
his
felt
hat
over
it
then
when
the
officer
was
gone
he
sat
down
in
the
opposite
the
president
and
struck
his
boots
with
a
little
cane
which
he
carried
in
his
hand
parry
who
accompanied
him
stood
behind
him
d
artagnan
was
looking
at
athos
whose
face
betrayed
all
those
emotions
which
the
king
possessing
more
had
banished
from
his
own
this
agitation
in
one
so
cold
and
calm
as
athos
frightened
him
i
hope
he
whispered
to
him
that
you
will
follow
his
majesty
s
example
and
not
get
killed
for
your
folly
in
this
set
your
mind
at
rest
replied
athos
aha
continued
d
artagnan
it
is
clear
that
they
are
afraid
of
something
or
other
for
look
the
sentinels
are
being
reinforced
they
had
only
halberds
before
now
they
have
muskets
the
halberds
were
for
the
audience
in
the
rear
the
muskets
are
for
thirty
forty
fifty
men
said
porthos
counting
the
reinforcements
ah
said
aramis
but
you
forget
the
d
artagnan
grew
pale
with
rage
he
recognized
mordaunt
who
with
bare
sword
was
marshalling
the
musketeers
behind
the
king
and
opposite
the
benches
do
you
think
they
have
recognized
us
said
d
artagnan
in
that
case
i
should
beat
a
retreat
i
don
t
care
to
be
shot
in
a
no
said
aramis
he
has
not
seen
us
he
sees
no
one
but
the
king
mon
dieu
how
he
stares
at
him
the
insolent
dog
does
he
hate
his
majesty
as
much
as
he
does
us
pardi
answered
athos
we
only
carried
off
his
mother
the
king
has
spoiled
him
of
his
name
and
true
said
aramis
but
silence
the
president
is
speaking
to
the
stuart
bradshaw
was
saying
listen
to
the
roll
call
of
your
judges
and
address
to
the
court
any
observations
you
may
have
to
the
king
turned
his
head
away
as
if
these
words
had
not
been
intended
for
him
bradshaw
waited
and
as
there
was
no
reply
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
out
of
the
hundred
and
members
designated
there
were
only
present
for
the
rest
fearful
of
taking
part
in
such
an
act
had
remained
away
when
the
name
of
colonel
fairfax
was
called
one
of
those
brief
but
solemn
silences
ensued
which
announced
the
absence
of
the
members
who
had
no
wish
to
take
a
personal
part
in
the
trial
colonel
fairfax
repeated
bradshaw
fairfax
answered
a
laughing
voice
the
silvery
tone
of
which
betrayed
it
as
that
of
a
woman
is
not
such
a
fool
as
to
be
a
loud
laugh
followed
these
words
pronounced
with
that
boldness
which
women
draw
from
their
own
weakness
a
weakness
which
removes
them
beyond
the
power
of
vengeance
it
is
a
woman
s
voice
cried
aramis
faith
i
would
give
a
good
deal
if
she
is
young
and
and
he
mounted
on
the
bench
to
try
and
get
a
sight
of
her
by
my
soul
said
aramis
she
is
charming
look
d
artagnan
everybody
is
looking
at
her
and
in
spite
of
bradshaw
s
gaze
she
has
not
turned
it
is
lady
fairfax
herself
said
d
artagnan
don
t
you
remember
porthos
we
saw
her
at
general
cromwell
s
the
roll
call
continued
these
rascals
will
adjourn
when
they
find
that
they
are
not
in
sufficient
force
said
the
comte
de
la
fere
you
don
t
know
them
athos
look
at
mordaunt
s
smile
is
that
the
look
of
a
man
whose
victim
is
likely
to
escape
him
ah
cursed
basilisk
it
will
be
a
happy
day
for
me
when
i
can
cross
something
more
than
a
look
with
the
king
is
really
very
handsome
said
porthos
and
look
too
though
he
is
a
prisoner
how
carefully
he
is
dressed
the
feather
in
his
hat
is
worth
at
least
pistoles
look
at
it
the
roll
call
finished
the
president
ordered
them
to
read
the
act
of
accusation
athos
turned
pale
a
second
time
he
was
disappointed
in
his
expectation
notwithstanding
the
judges
were
so
few
the
trial
was
to
continue
the
king
then
was
condemned
in
advance
i
told
you
so
athos
said
d
artagnan
shrugging
his
shoulders
now
take
your
courage
in
both
hands
and
hear
what
this
gentleman
in
black
is
going
to
say
about
his
sovereign
with
full
license
and
never
till
then
had
a
more
brutal
accusation
or
meaner
insults
tarnished
kingly
majesty
charles
listened
with
marked
attention
passing
over
the
insults
noting
the
grievances
and
when
hatred
overflowed
all
bounds
and
the
accuser
turned
executioner
beforehand
replying
with
a
smile
of
lofty
scorn
the
fact
is
said
d
artagnan
if
men
are
punished
for
imprudence
and
triviality
this
poor
king
deserves
punishment
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
which
he
is
just
now
undergoing
is
hard
in
any
case
aramis
replied
the
punishment
should
fall
not
on
the
king
but
on
his
ministers
for
the
first
article
of
the
constitution
is
the
king
can
do
no
as
for
me
thought
porthos
giving
mordaunt
his
whole
attention
were
it
not
for
breaking
in
on
the
majesty
of
the
situation
i
would
leap
down
from
the
bench
reach
mordaunt
in
three
bounds
and
strangle
him
i
would
then
take
him
by
the
feet
and
knock
the
life
out
of
these
wretched
musketeers
who
parody
the
musketeers
of
france
meantime
d
artagnan
who
is
full
of
invention
would
find
some
way
to
save
the
king
i
must
speak
to
him
about
as
to
athos
his
face
aflame
his
fists
clinched
his
lips
bitten
till
they
bled
he
sat
there
foaming
with
rage
at
that
endless
parliamentary
insult
and
that
long
enduring
royal
patience
the
inflexible
arm
and
steadfast
heart
had
given
place
to
a
trembling
hand
and
a
body
shaken
by
excitement
at
this
moment
the
accuser
concluded
with
these
words
the
present
accusation
is
preferred
by
us
in
the
name
of
the
english
at
these
words
there
was
a
murmur
along
the
benches
and
a
second
voice
not
that
of
a
woman
but
a
man
s
stout
and
furious
thundered
behind
d
artagnan
you
lie
it
cried
of
the
english
people
are
horrified
at
what
you
this
voice
was
that
of
athos
who
standing
up
with
outstretched
hand
and
quite
out
of
his
mind
thus
assailed
the
public
accuser
king
judges
spectators
all
turned
their
eyes
to
the
bench
where
the
four
friends
were
seated
mordaunt
did
the
same
and
recognized
the
gentleman
around
whom
the
three
other
frenchmen
were
standing
pale
and
menacing
his
eyes
glittered
with
delight
he
had
discovered
those
to
whose
death
he
had
devoted
his
life
a
movement
of
fury
called
to
his
side
some
twenty
of
his
musketeers
and
pointing
to
the
bench
where
his
enemies
were
fire
on
that
bench
he
cried
but
with
the
rapidity
of
thought
d
artagnan
seized
athos
by
the
waist
and
followed
by
porthos
with
aramis
leaped
down
from
the
benches
rushed
into
the
passages
and
flying
down
the
staircase
were
lost
in
the
crowd
without
while
the
muskets
within
were
pointed
on
some
three
thousand
spectators
whose
piteous
cries
and
noisy
alarm
stopped
the
impulse
already
given
to
bloodshed
charles
also
had
recognized
the
four
frenchmen
he
put
one
hand
on
his
heart
to
still
its
beating
and
the
other
over
his
eyes
that
he
might
not
witness
the
slaying
of
his
faithful
friends
mordaunt
pale
and
trembling
with
anger
rushed
from
the
hall
sword
in
hand
followed
by
six
pikemen
pushing
inquiring
and
panting
in
the
crowd
and
then
having
found
nothing
returned
the
tumult
was
indescribable
more
than
half
an
hour
passed
before
any
one
could
make
himself
heard
the
judges
were
looking
for
a
new
outbreak
from
the
benches
the
spectators
saw
the
muskets
leveled
at
them
and
divided
between
fear
and
curiosity
remained
noisy
and
excited
quiet
was
at
length
restored
what
have
you
to
say
in
your
defense
asked
bradshaw
of
the
king
then
rising
with
his
head
still
covered
in
the
tone
of
a
judge
rather
than
a
prisoner
charles
began
before
questioning
me
he
said
reply
to
my
question
i
was
free
at
newcastle
and
had
there
concluded
a
treaty
with
both
houses
instead
of
performing
your
part
of
this
contract
as
i
performed
mine
you
bought
me
from
the
scotch
cheaply
i
know
and
that
does
honor
to
the
economic
talent
of
your
government
but
because
you
have
paid
the
price
of
a
slave
do
you
imagine
that
i
have
ceased
to
be
your
king
no
to
answer
you
would
be
to
forget
it
i
shall
only
reply
to
you
when
you
have
satisfied
me
of
your
right
to
question
me
to
answer
you
would
be
to
acknowledge
you
as
my
judges
and
i
only
acknowledge
you
as
my
and
in
the
middle
of
a
deathlike
silence
charles
calm
lofty
and
with
his
head
still
covered
sat
down
again
in
his
why
are
not
my
frenchmen
here
he
murmured
proudly
and
turning
his
eyes
to
the
benches
where
they
had
appeared
for
a
moment
they
would
have
seen
that
their
friend
was
worthy
of
their
defense
while
alive
and
of
their
tears
when
well
said
the
president
seeing
that
charles
was
determined
to
remain
silent
so
be
it
we
will
judge
you
in
spite
of
your
silence
you
are
accused
of
treason
of
abuse
of
power
and
murder
the
evidence
will
support
it
go
and
another
sitting
will
accomplish
what
you
have
postponed
in
charles
rose
and
turned
toward
parry
whom
he
saw
pale
and
with
his
temples
dewed
with
moisture
well
my
dear
parry
said
he
what
is
the
matter
and
what
can
affect
you
in
this
manner
oh
my
king
said
parry
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
in
a
tone
of
supplication
do
not
look
to
the
left
as
we
leave
the
and
why
parry
do
not
look
i
implore
you
my
but
what
is
the
matter
speak
said
charles
attempting
to
look
across
the
hedge
of
guards
which
surrounded
him
it
is
but
you
will
not
look
will
you
it
is
because
they
have
had
the
axe
with
which
criminals
are
executed
brought
and
placed
there
on
the
table
the
sight
is
fools
said
charles
do
they
take
me
for
a
coward
like
themselves
you
have
done
well
to
warn
me
thank
you
when
the
moment
arrived
the
king
followed
his
guards
out
of
the
hall
as
he
passed
the
table
on
which
the
axe
was
laid
he
stopped
and
turning
with
a
smile
said
ah
the
axe
an
ingenious
device
and
well
worthy
of
those
who
know
not
what
a
gentleman
is
you
frighten
me
not
executioner
s
axe
added
he
touching
it
with
the
cane
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
i
strike
you
now
waiting
patiently
and
christianly
for
you
to
return
the
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
with
unaffected
contempt
he
passed
on
when
he
reached
the
door
a
stream
of
people
who
had
been
disappointed
in
not
being
able
to
get
into
the
house
and
to
make
amends
had
collected
to
see
him
come
out
stood
on
each
side
as
he
passed
many
among
them
glaring
on
him
with
threatening
looks
how
many
people
thought
he
and
not
one
true
and
as
he
uttered
these
words
of
doubt
and
depression
within
his
mind
a
voice
beside
him
said
respect
to
fallen
the
king
turned
quickly
around
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
heart
it
was
an
old
soldier
of
the
guards
who
could
not
see
his
king
pass
captive
before
him
without
rendering
him
this
final
homage
but
the
next
moment
the
unfortunate
man
was
nearly
killed
with
heavy
blows
of
and
among
those
who
set
upon
him
the
king
recognized
captain
groslow
alas
said
charles
that
is
a
severe
chastisement
for
a
very
trifling
he
continued
his
walk
but
he
had
scarcely
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
a
furious
fellow
leaning
between
two
soldiers
spat
in
the
king
s
face
as
once
an
infamous
and
accursed
jew
spit
in
the
face
of
jesus
of
nazareth
loud
roars
of
laughter
and
sullen
murmurs
arose
together
the
crowd
opened
and
closed
again
undulating
like
a
stormy
sea
and
the
king
imagined
that
he
saw
shining
in
the
midst
of
this
living
wave
the
bright
eyes
of
athos
charles
wiped
his
face
and
said
with
a
sad
smile
poor
wretch
for
half
a
crown
he
would
do
as
much
to
his
own
the
king
was
not
mistaken
athos
and
his
friends
again
mingling
with
the
throng
were
taking
a
last
look
at
the
martyr
king
when
the
soldier
saluted
charles
athos
s
heart
bounded
for
joy
and
that
unfortunate
on
coming
to
himself
found
ten
guineas
that
the
french
gentleman
had
slipped
into
his
pocket
but
when
the
cowardly
insulter
spat
in
the
face
of
the
captive
monarch
athos
grasped
his
dagger
but
d
artagnan
stopped
his
hand
and
in
a
hoarse
voice
cried
wait
athos
stopped
d
artagnan
leaning
on
athos
made
a
sign
to
porthos
and
aramis
to
keep
near
them
and
then
placed
himself
behind
the
man
with
the
bare
arms
who
was
still
laughing
at
his
own
vile
pleasantry
and
receiving
the
congratulations
of
several
others
the
man
took
his
way
toward
the
city
the
four
friends
followed
him
the
man
who
had
the
appearance
of
being
a
butcher
descended
a
little
steep
and
isolated
street
looking
on
to
the
river
with
two
of
his
friends
arrived
at
the
bank
of
the
river
the
three
men
perceived
that
they
were
followed
turned
around
and
looking
insolently
at
the
frenchmen
passed
some
jests
from
one
to
another
i
don
t
know
english
athos
said
d
artagnan
but
you
know
it
and
will
interpret
for
then
quickening
their
steps
they
passed
the
three
men
but
turned
back
immediately
and
d
artagnan
walked
straight
up
to
the
butcher
and
touching
him
on
the
chest
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
said
to
athos
say
this
to
him
in
english
you
are
a
coward
you
have
insulted
a
defenseless
man
you
have
befouled
the
face
of
your
king
you
must
athos
pale
as
a
ghost
repeated
these
words
to
the
man
who
seeing
the
bodeful
preparations
that
were
making
put
himself
in
an
attitude
of
defense
aramis
at
this
movement
drew
his
sword
no
cried
d
artagnan
no
steel
steel
is
for
and
seizing
the
butcher
by
the
throat
porthos
said
he
kill
this
fellow
for
me
with
a
single
porthos
raised
his
terrible
fist
which
whistled
through
the
air
like
a
sling
and
the
portentous
mass
fell
with
a
smothered
crash
on
the
insulter
s
skull
and
crushed
it
the
man
fell
like
an
ox
beneath
the
poleaxe
his
companions
could
neither
move
nor
cry
out
tell
them
this
athos
resumed
d
artagnan
thus
shall
all
die
who
forget
that
a
captive
man
is
sacred
and
that
a
captive
king
doubly
represents
the
athos
repeated
d
artagnan
s
words
the
fellows
looked
at
the
body
of
their
companion
swimming
in
blood
and
then
recovering
voice
and
legs
together
ran
screaming
off
justice
is
done
said
porthos
wiping
his
forehead
and
now
said
d
artagnan
to
athos
entertain
no
further
doubts
about
me
i
undertake
all
that
concerns
the
whitehall
the
parliament
condemned
charles
to
death
as
might
have
been
foreseen
political
judgments
are
generally
vain
formalities
for
the
same
passions
which
give
rise
to
the
accusation
ordain
to
the
condemnation
such
is
the
atrocious
logic
of
revolutions
although
our
friends
were
expecting
that
condemnation
it
filled
them
with
grief
d
artagnan
whose
mind
was
never
more
fertile
in
resources
than
in
critical
emergencies
swore
again
that
he
would
try
all
conceivable
means
to
prevent
the
denouement
of
the
bloody
tragedy
but
by
what
means
as
yet
he
could
form
no
definite
plan
all
must
depend
on
circumstances
meanwhile
it
was
necessary
at
all
hazards
in
order
to
gain
time
to
put
some
obstacle
in
the
way
of
the
execution
on
the
following
day
the
day
appointed
by
the
judges
the
only
way
of
doing
that
was
to
cause
the
disappearance
of
the
london
executioner
the
headsman
out
of
the
way
the
sentence
could
not
be
executed
true
they
could
send
for
the
headsman
of
the
nearest
town
but
at
least
a
day
would
be
gained
and
a
day
might
be
sufficient
for
the
rescue
d
artagnan
took
upon
himself
that
more
than
difficult
task
another
thing
not
less
essential
was
to
warn
charles
stuart
of
the
attempt
to
be
made
so
that
he
might
assist
his
rescuers
as
much
as
possible
or
at
least
do
nothing
to
thwart
their
efforts
aramis
assumed
that
perilous
charge
charles
stuart
had
asked
that
bishop
juxon
might
be
permitted
to
visit
him
mordaunt
had
called
on
the
bishop
that
very
evening
to
apprise
him
of
the
religious
desire
expressed
by
the
king
and
also
of
cromwell
s
permission
aramis
determined
to
obtain
from
the
bishop
through
fear
or
by
persuasion
consent
that
he
should
enter
in
the
bishop
s
place
and
clad
in
his
sacerdotal
robes
the
prison
at
whitehall
finally
athos
undertook
to
provide
in
any
event
the
means
of
leaving
england
in
case
either
of
failure
or
of
success
the
night
having
come
they
made
an
appointment
to
meet
at
eleven
o
clock
at
the
hotel
and
each
started
out
to
fulfill
his
dangerous
mission
the
palace
of
whitehall
was
guarded
by
three
regiments
of
cavalry
and
by
the
fierce
anxiety
of
cromwell
who
came
and
went
or
sent
his
generals
or
his
agents
continually
alone
in
his
usual
room
lighted
by
two
candles
the
condemned
monarch
gazed
sadly
on
the
luxury
of
his
past
greatness
just
as
at
the
last
hour
one
sees
the
images
of
life
more
mildly
brilliant
than
of
yore
parry
had
not
quitted
his
master
and
since
his
condemnation
had
not
ceased
to
weep
charles
leaning
on
a
table
was
gazing
at
a
medallion
of
his
wife
and
daughter
he
was
waiting
first
for
juxon
then
for
martyrdom
at
times
he
thought
of
those
brave
french
gentlemen
who
had
appeared
to
him
from
a
distance
of
a
hundred
leagues
fabulous
and
unreal
like
the
forms
that
appear
in
dreams
in
fact
he
sometimes
asked
himself
if
all
that
was
happening
to
him
was
not
a
dream
or
at
least
the
delirium
of
a
fever
he
rose
and
took
a
few
steps
as
if
to
rouse
himself
from
his
torpor
and
went
as
far
as
the
window
he
saw
glittering
below
him
the
muskets
of
the
guards
he
was
thereupon
constrained
to
admit
that
he
was
indeed
awake
and
that
his
bloody
dream
was
real
charles
returned
in
silence
to
his
chair
rested
his
elbow
on
the
table
bowed
his
head
upon
his
hand
and
reflected
alas
he
said
to
himself
if
i
only
had
for
a
confessor
one
of
those
lights
of
the
church
whose
soul
has
sounded
all
the
mysteries
of
life
all
the
littlenesses
of
greatness
perhaps
his
utterance
would
overawe
the
voice
that
wails
within
my
soul
but
i
shall
have
a
priest
of
vulgar
mind
whose
career
and
fortune
i
have
ruined
by
my
misfortune
he
will
speak
to
me
of
god
and
death
as
he
has
spoken
to
many
another
dying
man
not
understanding
that
this
one
leaves
his
throne
to
an
usurper
his
children
to
the
cold
contempt
of
public
and
he
raised
the
medallion
to
his
lips
it
was
a
dull
foggy
night
a
neighboring
church
clock
slowly
struck
the
hour
the
flickering
light
of
the
two
candles
showed
fitful
phantom
shadows
in
the
lofty
room
these
were
the
ancestors
of
charles
standing
back
dimly
in
their
tarnished
frames
an
awful
sadness
enveloped
the
heart
of
charles
he
buried
his
brow
in
his
hands
and
thought
of
the
world
so
beautiful
when
one
is
about
to
leave
it
of
the
caresses
of
children
so
pleasing
and
so
sweet
especially
when
one
is
parting
from
his
children
never
to
see
them
again
then
of
his
wife
the
noble
and
courageous
woman
who
had
sustained
him
to
the
last
moment
he
drew
from
his
breast
the
diamond
cross
and
the
star
of
the
garter
which
she
had
sent
him
by
those
generous
frenchmen
he
kissed
it
and
then
as
he
reflected
that
she
would
never
again
see
those
things
till
he
lay
cold
and
mutilated
in
the
tomb
there
passed
over
him
one
of
those
icy
shivers
which
may
be
called
forerunners
of
death
then
in
that
chamber
which
recalled
to
him
so
many
royal
souvenirs
whither
had
come
so
many
courtiers
the
scene
of
so
much
flattering
homage
alone
with
a
despairing
servant
whose
feeble
soul
could
afford
no
support
to
his
own
the
king
at
last
yielded
to
sorrow
and
his
courage
sank
to
a
level
with
that
feebleness
those
shadows
and
that
wintry
cold
that
king
who
was
so
grand
so
sublime
in
the
hour
of
death
meeting
his
fate
with
a
smile
of
resignation
on
his
lips
now
in
that
gloomy
hour
wiped
away
a
tear
which
had
fallen
on
the
table
and
quivered
on
the
gold
embroidered
cloth
suddenly
the
door
opened
an
ecclesiastic
in
episcopal
robes
entered
followed
by
two
guards
to
whom
the
king
waved
an
imperious
gesture
the
guards
retired
the
room
resumed
its
obscurity
juxon
cried
charles
juxon
thank
you
my
last
friend
you
come
at
a
fitting
the
bishop
looked
anxiously
at
the
man
sobbing
in
the
come
parry
said
the
king
cease
your
if
it
s
parry
said
the
bishop
i
have
nothing
to
fear
so
allow
me
to
salute
your
majesty
and
to
tell
you
who
i
am
and
for
what
i
am
at
this
sight
and
this
voice
charles
was
about
to
cry
out
when
aramis
placed
his
finger
on
his
lips
and
bowed
low
to
the
king
of
england
the
chevalier
murmured
charles
yes
sire
interrupted
aramis
raising
his
voice
bishop
juxon
the
faithful
knight
of
christ
obedient
to
your
majesty
s
charles
clasped
his
hands
amazed
and
stupefied
to
find
that
these
foreigners
without
other
motive
than
that
which
their
conscience
imposed
on
them
thus
combated
the
will
of
a
people
and
the
destiny
of
a
king
you
he
said
you
how
did
you
penetrate
hither
if
they
recognize
you
you
are
care
not
for
me
sire
think
only
of
yourself
you
see
your
friends
are
wakeful
i
know
not
what
we
shall
do
yet
but
four
determined
men
can
do
much
meanwhile
do
not
be
surprised
at
anything
that
happens
prepare
yourself
for
every
charles
shook
his
head
do
you
know
that
i
die
at
ten
o
clock
something
your
majesty
will
happen
between
now
and
then
to
make
the
execution
the
king
looked
at
aramis
with
astonishment
at
this
moment
a
strange
noise
like
the
unloading
of
a
cart
and
followed
by
a
cry
of
pain
was
heard
beneath
the
window
do
you
hear
said
the
king
i
hear
said
aramis
but
i
understand
neither
the
noise
nor
the
cry
of
i
know
not
who
can
have
uttered
the
cry
said
the
king
but
the
noise
is
easily
understood
do
you
know
that
i
am
to
be
beheaded
outside
this
window
well
these
boards
you
hear
unloaded
are
the
posts
and
planks
to
build
my
scaffold
some
workmen
must
have
fallen
underneath
them
and
been
aramis
shuddered
in
spite
of
himself
you
see
said
the
king
that
it
is
useless
for
you
to
resist
i
am
condemned
leave
me
to
my
my
king
said
aramis
they
well
may
raise
a
scaffold
but
they
can
not
make
an
what
do
you
mean
asked
the
king
i
mean
that
at
this
hour
the
headsman
has
been
got
out
of
the
way
by
force
or
persuasion
the
scaffold
will
be
ready
by
but
the
headsman
will
be
wanting
and
they
will
put
it
off
till
the
day
after
what
then
said
the
king
night
we
shall
rescue
how
can
that
be
cried
the
king
whose
face
was
lighted
up
in
spite
of
himself
by
a
flash
of
joy
oh
sir
cried
parry
may
you
and
yours
be
blessed
how
can
it
be
repeated
the
king
i
must
know
so
that
i
may
assist
you
if
there
is
any
i
know
nothing
about
it
continued
aramis
but
the
cleverest
the
bravest
the
most
devoted
of
us
four
said
to
me
when
i
left
him
tell
the
king
that
at
ten
o
clock
at
night
we
shall
carry
him
he
has
said
it
and
will
do
tell
me
the
name
of
that
generous
friend
said
the
king
that
i
may
cherish
for
him
an
eternal
gratitude
whether
he
succeeds
or
d
artagnan
sire
the
same
who
had
so
nearly
rescued
you
when
colonel
harrison
made
his
untimely
you
are
indeed
wonderful
men
said
the
king
if
such
things
had
been
related
to
me
i
should
not
have
believed
now
sire
resumed
aramis
listen
to
me
do
not
forget
for
a
single
instant
that
we
are
watching
over
your
safety
observe
the
smallest
gesture
the
least
bit
of
song
the
least
sign
from
any
one
near
you
watch
everything
hear
everything
interpret
oh
chevalier
cried
the
king
what
can
i
say
to
you
there
is
no
word
though
it
should
come
from
the
profoundest
depth
of
my
heart
that
can
express
my
gratitude
if
you
succeed
i
do
not
say
that
you
will
save
a
king
no
in
presence
of
the
scaffold
as
i
am
royalty
i
assure
you
is
a
very
small
affair
but
you
will
save
a
husband
to
his
wife
a
father
to
his
children
chevalier
take
my
hand
it
is
that
of
a
friend
who
will
love
you
to
his
last
aramis
stooped
to
kiss
the
king
s
hand
but
charles
clasped
his
and
pressed
it
to
his
heart
at
this
moment
a
man
entered
without
even
knocking
at
the
door
aramis
tried
to
withdraw
his
hand
but
the
king
still
held
it
the
man
was
one
of
those
puritans
half
preacher
and
half
soldier
who
swarmed
around
cromwell
what
do
you
want
sir
said
the
king
i
desire
to
know
if
the
confession
of
charles
stuart
is
at
an
end
said
the
stranger
and
what
is
it
to
you
replied
the
king
we
are
not
of
the
same
all
men
are
brothers
said
the
puritan
one
of
my
brothers
is
about
to
die
and
i
come
to
prepare
bear
with
him
whispered
aramis
it
is
doubtless
some
after
my
reverend
lord
bishop
said
the
king
to
the
man
i
shall
hear
you
with
pleasure
the
man
retired
but
not
before
examining
the
supposed
juxon
with
an
attention
which
did
not
escape
the
king
chevalier
said
the
king
when
the
door
was
closed
i
believe
you
are
right
and
that
this
man
only
came
here
with
evil
intentions
take
care
that
no
misfortune
befalls
you
when
you
i
thank
your
majesty
said
aramis
but
under
these
robes
i
have
a
coat
of
mail
a
pistol
and
a
go
then
sir
and
god
keep
you
the
king
accompanied
him
to
the
door
where
aramis
pronounced
his
benediction
upon
him
and
passing
through
the
filled
with
soldiers
jumped
into
his
carriage
and
drove
to
the
bishop
s
palace
juxon
was
waiting
for
him
impatiently
well
said
he
on
perceiving
aramis
everything
has
succeeded
as
i
expected
spies
guards
satellites
all
took
me
for
you
and
the
king
blesses
you
while
waiting
for
you
to
bless
may
god
protect
you
my
son
for
your
example
has
given
me
at
the
same
time
hope
and
aramis
resumed
his
own
attire
and
left
juxon
with
the
assurance
that
he
might
again
have
recourse
to
him
he
had
scarcely
gone
ten
yards
in
the
street
when
he
perceived
that
he
was
followed
by
a
man
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
dagger
and
stopped
the
man
came
straight
toward
him
it
was
porthos
my
dear
friend
cried
aramis
you
see
we
had
each
our
mission
said
porthos
mine
was
to
guard
you
and
i
am
doing
so
have
you
seen
the
king
yes
and
all
goes
we
are
to
meet
our
friends
at
the
hotel
at
it
was
then
striking
ten
by
paul
s
arrived
at
the
hotel
it
was
not
long
before
athos
entered
all
s
well
he
cried
as
he
entered
i
have
hired
a
cedar
wherry
as
light
as
a
canoe
as
easy
on
the
wing
as
any
swallow
it
is
waiting
for
us
at
greenwich
opposite
the
isle
of
dogs
manned
by
a
captain
and
four
men
who
for
the
sum
of
fifty
pounds
sterling
will
keep
themselves
at
our
disposition
three
successive
nights
once
on
board
we
drop
down
the
thames
and
in
two
hours
are
on
the
open
sea
in
case
i
am
killed
the
captain
s
name
is
roger
and
the
skiff
is
called
the
lightning
a
handkerchief
tied
at
the
four
corners
is
to
be
the
next
moment
d
artagnan
entered
empty
your
pockets
said
he
i
want
a
hundred
pounds
and
as
for
my
own
and
he
emptied
them
inside
out
the
sum
was
collected
in
a
minute
d
artagnan
ran
out
and
returned
directly
after
there
said
he
it
s
done
ough
and
not
without
a
deal
of
trouble
has
the
executioner
left
london
asked
athos
ah
you
see
that
plan
was
not
sure
enough
he
might
go
out
by
one
gate
and
return
by
where
is
he
then
in
the
the
cellar
what
cellar
our
landlord
s
to
be
sure
mousqueton
is
propped
against
the
door
and
here
s
the
bravo
said
aramis
how
did
you
manage
it
like
everything
else
with
money
but
it
cost
me
how
much
asked
athos
five
hundred
and
where
did
you
get
so
much
money
said
athos
had
you
then
that
sum
the
queen
s
famous
diamond
answered
d
artagnan
with
a
sigh
ah
true
said
aramis
i
recognized
it
on
your
you
bought
it
back
then
from
monsieur
des
essarts
asked
porthos
yes
but
it
was
fated
that
i
should
not
keep
so
then
we
are
all
right
as
regards
the
executioner
said
athos
but
unfortunately
every
executioner
has
his
assistant
his
man
or
whatever
you
call
and
this
one
had
his
said
d
artagnan
but
as
good
luck
would
have
it
just
as
i
thought
i
should
have
two
affairs
to
manage
our
friend
was
brought
home
with
a
broken
leg
in
the
excess
of
his
zeal
he
had
accompanied
the
cart
containing
the
scaffolding
as
far
as
the
king
s
window
and
one
of
the
crossbeams
fell
on
his
leg
and
broke
ah
cried
aramis
that
accounts
for
the
cry
i
probably
said
d
artagnan
but
as
he
is
a
thoughtful
young
man
he
promised
to
send
four
expert
workmen
in
his
place
to
help
those
already
at
the
scaffold
and
wrote
the
moment
he
was
brought
home
to
master
tom
lowe
an
assistant
carpenter
and
friend
of
his
to
go
down
to
whitehall
with
three
of
his
friends
here
s
the
letter
he
sent
by
a
messenger
for
sixpence
who
sold
it
to
me
for
a
and
what
on
earth
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
athos
can
t
you
guess
my
dear
athos
you
who
speak
english
like
john
bull
himself
are
master
tom
lowe
we
your
three
companions
do
you
understand
it
now
athos
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
admiration
ran
to
a
closet
and
drew
forth
workmen
s
clothes
which
the
four
friends
immediately
put
on
they
then
left
the
hotel
athos
carrying
a
saw
porthos
a
vise
aramis
an
axe
and
d
artagnan
a
hammer
and
some
nails
the
letter
from
the
executioner
s
assistant
satisfied
the
master
carpenter
that
those
were
the
men
he
expected
the
workmen
toward
midnight
charles
heard
a
great
noise
beneath
his
window
it
arose
from
blows
of
hammer
and
hatchet
clinking
of
pincers
and
cranching
of
saws
lying
dressed
upon
his
bed
the
noise
awoke
him
with
a
start
and
found
a
gloomy
echo
in
his
heart
he
could
not
endure
it
and
sent
parry
to
ask
the
sentinel
to
beg
the
workmen
to
strike
more
gently
and
not
disturb
the
last
slumber
of
one
who
had
been
their
king
the
sentinel
was
unwilling
to
leave
his
post
but
allowed
parry
to
pass
arriving
at
the
window
parry
found
an
unfinished
scaffold
over
which
they
were
nailing
a
covering
of
black
serge
raised
to
the
height
of
twenty
feet
so
as
to
be
on
a
level
with
the
window
it
had
two
lower
stories
parry
odious
as
was
this
sight
to
him
sought
for
those
among
some
eight
or
ten
workmen
who
were
making
the
most
noise
and
fixed
on
two
men
who
were
loosening
the
last
hooks
of
the
iron
balcony
my
friends
said
parry
mounting
the
scaffold
and
standing
beside
them
would
you
work
a
little
more
quietly
the
king
wishes
to
get
a
one
of
the
two
who
was
standing
up
was
of
gigantic
size
and
was
driving
a
pick
with
all
his
might
into
the
wall
whilst
the
other
kneeling
beside
him
was
collecting
the
pieces
of
stone
the
face
of
the
first
was
lost
to
parry
in
the
darkness
but
as
the
second
turned
around
and
placed
his
finger
on
his
lips
parry
started
back
in
amazement
very
well
very
well
said
the
workman
aloud
in
excellent
english
tell
the
king
that
if
he
sleeps
badly
he
will
sleep
better
these
blunt
words
so
terrible
if
taken
literally
were
received
by
the
other
workmen
with
a
roar
of
laughter
but
parry
withdrew
thinking
he
was
dreaming
charles
was
impatiently
awaiting
his
return
at
the
moment
he
the
sentinel
who
guarded
the
door
put
his
head
through
the
opening
curious
as
to
what
the
king
was
doing
the
king
was
lying
on
his
bed
resting
on
his
elbow
parry
closed
the
door
and
approaching
the
king
his
face
radiant
with
joy
sire
he
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
know
who
these
workmen
are
who
are
making
so
much
noise
i
no
how
would
you
have
me
know
parry
bent
his
head
and
whispered
to
the
king
it
is
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
his
raising
my
scaffold
cried
the
king
astounded
yes
and
at
the
same
time
making
a
hole
in
the
the
king
clasped
his
hands
and
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
then
leaping
down
from
his
bed
he
went
to
the
window
and
pulling
aside
the
curtain
tried
to
distinguish
the
figures
outside
but
in
vain
parry
was
not
wrong
it
was
athos
he
had
recognized
and
porthos
who
was
boring
a
hole
through
the
wall
this
hole
communicated
with
a
kind
of
loft
the
space
between
the
floor
of
the
king
s
room
and
the
ceiling
of
the
one
below
it
their
plan
was
to
pass
through
the
hole
they
were
making
into
this
loft
and
cut
out
from
below
a
piece
of
the
flooring
of
the
king
s
room
so
as
to
form
a
kind
of
through
this
the
king
was
to
escape
the
next
night
and
hidden
by
the
black
covering
of
the
scaffold
was
to
change
his
dress
for
that
of
a
workman
slip
out
with
his
deliverers
pass
the
sentinels
who
would
suspect
nothing
and
so
reach
the
skiff
that
was
waiting
for
him
at
greenwich
day
gilded
the
tops
of
the
houses
the
aperture
was
finished
and
athos
passed
through
it
carrying
the
clothes
destined
for
the
king
wrapped
in
black
cloth
and
the
tools
with
which
he
was
to
open
a
communication
with
the
king
s
room
he
had
only
two
hours
work
to
do
to
open
communication
with
the
king
and
according
to
the
calculations
of
the
four
friends
they
had
the
entire
day
before
them
since
the
executioner
being
absent
another
must
be
sent
for
to
bristol
d
artagnan
returned
to
change
his
workman
s
clothes
for
his
suit
and
porthos
to
put
on
his
red
doublet
as
for
aramis
he
went
off
to
the
bishop
s
palace
to
see
if
he
could
possibly
pass
in
with
juxon
to
the
king
s
presence
all
three
agreed
to
meet
at
noon
in
whitehall
place
to
see
how
things
went
on
before
leaving
the
scaffold
aramis
had
approached
the
opening
where
athos
was
concealed
to
tell
him
that
he
was
about
to
make
an
attempt
to
gain
another
interview
with
the
king
adieu
then
and
be
of
good
courage
said
athos
report
to
the
king
the
condition
of
affairs
say
to
him
that
when
he
is
alone
it
will
help
us
if
he
will
knock
on
the
floor
for
then
i
can
continue
my
work
in
safety
try
aramis
to
keep
near
the
king
speak
loud
very
loud
for
they
will
be
listening
at
the
door
if
there
is
a
sentinel
within
the
apartment
kill
him
without
hesitation
if
there
are
two
let
parry
kill
one
and
you
the
other
if
there
are
three
let
yourself
be
slain
but
save
the
be
easy
said
aramis
i
will
take
two
poniards
and
give
one
to
parry
is
that
all
yes
go
but
urge
the
king
strongly
not
to
stand
on
false
generosity
while
you
are
fighting
if
there
is
a
fight
he
must
flee
the
trap
once
replaced
over
his
head
you
being
on
the
trap
dead
or
alive
they
will
need
at
least
ten
minutes
to
find
the
hole
by
which
he
has
escaped
in
those
ten
minutes
we
shall
have
gained
the
road
and
the
king
will
be
everything
shall
be
done
as
you
say
athos
your
hand
for
perhaps
we
shall
not
see
each
other
athos
put
his
arm
around
aramis
s
neck
and
embraced
him
for
you
he
said
now
if
i
die
say
to
d
artagnan
that
i
love
him
as
a
son
and
embrace
him
for
me
embrace
also
our
good
and
brave
porthos
adieu
said
aramis
i
am
as
sure
now
that
the
king
will
be
saved
as
i
am
sure
that
i
clasp
the
most
loyal
hand
in
the
aramis
parted
from
athos
went
down
from
the
scaffold
in
his
turn
and
took
his
way
to
the
hotel
whistling
the
air
of
a
song
in
praise
of
cromwell
he
found
the
other
two
friends
sitting
at
table
before
a
good
fire
drinking
a
bottle
of
port
and
devouring
a
cold
chicken
porthos
was
cursing
the
infamous
parliamentarians
d
artagnan
ate
in
silence
revolving
in
his
mind
the
most
audacious
plans
aramis
related
what
had
been
agreed
upon
d
artagnan
approved
with
a
movement
of
the
head
and
porthos
with
his
voice
bravo
he
said
besides
we
shall
be
there
at
the
time
of
the
flight

d
artagnan
grimaud
and
mousqueton
we
can

hasty
mouthful

a
glass
of

he

my
life
upon
my
aramis
again
presented
himself
at
the
bishop
s
juxon
consented
the
more
readily
to
take
him
with
him
as
he
would
require
an
assistant
priest
in
case
the
king
should
wish
to
communicate
dressed
as
aramis
had
been
the
night
before
the
bishop
got
into
his
carriage
and
the
former
more
disguised
by
his
pallor
and
sad
countenance
than
his
deacon
s
dress
got
in
by
his
side
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
palace
it
was
about
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
nothing
was
changed
the
were
still
full
of
soldiers
the
passages
still
lined
by
guards
the
king
was
already
sanguine
but
when
he
perceived
aramis
his
hope
turned
to
joy
he
embraced
juxon
and
pressed
the
hand
of
aramis
the
bishop
affected
to
speak
in
a
loud
voice
before
every
one
of
their
previous
interview
the
king
replied
that
the
words
spoken
in
that
interview
had
borne
their
fruit
and
that
he
desired
another
under
the
same
conditions
juxon
turned
to
those
present
and
begged
them
to
leave
him
and
his
assistant
alone
with
the
king
every
one
withdrew
as
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
sire
said
aramis
speaking
rapidly
you
are
saved
the
london
executioner
has
vanished
his
assistant
broke
his
leg
last
night
beneath
your
majesty
s
window
the
cry
we
heard
was
his
and
there
is
no
executioner
nearer
at
hand
than
but
the
comte
de
la
fere
asked
the
king
two
feet
below
you
take
the
poker
from
the
fireplace
and
strike
three
times
on
the
floor
he
will
answer
the
king
did
so
and
the
moment
after
three
muffled
knocks
answering
the
given
signal
sounded
beneath
the
floor
so
said
charles
he
who
knocks
down
there
is
the
comte
de
la
fere
sire
said
aramis
he
is
preparing
a
way
for
your
majesty
to
escape
parry
for
his
part
will
raise
this
slab
of
marble
and
a
passage
will
be
oh
juxon
said
the
king
seizing
the
bishop
s
two
hands
in
his
own
promise
that
you
will
pray
all
your
life
for
this
gentleman
and
for
the
other
that
you
hear
beneath
your
feet
and
for
two
others
also
who
wherever
they
may
be
are
on
the
watch
for
my
sire
replied
juxon
you
shall
be
meanwhile
the
miner
underneath
was
heard
working
away
incessantly
when
suddenly
an
unexpected
noise
resounded
in
the
passage
aramis
seized
the
poker
and
gave
the
signal
to
stop
the
noise
came
nearer
and
nearer
it
was
that
of
a
number
of
men
steadily
approaching
the
four
men
stood
motionless
all
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
door
which
opened
slowly
and
with
a
kind
of
solemnity
a
parliamentary
officer
clothed
in
black
and
with
a
gravity
that
augured
ill
entered
bowed
to
the
king
and
unfolding
a
parchment
read
the
sentence
as
is
usually
done
to
criminals
before
their
execution
what
is
this
said
aramis
to
juxon
juxon
replied
with
a
sign
which
meant
that
he
knew
no
more
than
aramis
about
it
then
it
is
for
asked
the
king
was
not
your
majesty
warned
that
it
was
to
take
place
this
morning
then
i
must
die
like
a
common
criminal
by
the
hand
of
the
london
executioner
the
london
executioner
has
disappeared
your
majesty
but
a
man
has
offered
his
services
instead
the
execution
will
therefore
only
be
delayed
long
enough
for
you
to
arrange
your
spiritual
and
temporal
a
slight
moisture
on
his
brow
was
the
only
trace
of
emotion
that
charles
evinced
as
he
learned
these
tidings
but
aramis
was
livid
his
heart
ceased
beating
he
closed
his
eyes
and
leaned
upon
the
table
charles
perceived
it
and
took
his
hand
come
my
friend
said
he
then
he
turned
to
the
officer
sir
i
am
ready
there
is
but
little
reason
why
i
should
delay
you
firstly
i
wish
to
communicate
secondly
to
embrace
my
children
and
bid
them
farewell
for
the
last
time
will
this
be
permitted
me
certainly
replied
the
officer
and
left
the
room
aramis
dug
his
nails
into
his
flesh
and
groaned
aloud
oh
my
lord
bishop
he
cried
seizing
juxon
s
hands
where
is
providence
where
is
providence
my
son
replied
the
bishop
with
firmness
you
see
him
not
because
the
passions
of
the
world
conceal
my
son
said
the
king
to
aramis
do
not
take
it
so
to
heart
you
ask
what
god
is
doing
god
beholds
your
devotion
and
my
martyrdom
and
believe
me
both
will
have
their
reward
ascribe
to
men
then
what
is
happening
and
not
to
god
it
is
men
who
drive
me
to
death
it
is
men
who
make
you
yes
sire
said
aramis
yes
you
are
right
it
is
men
whom
i
should
hold
responsible
and
i
will
hold
them
be
seated
juxon
said
the
king
falling
upon
his
knees
i
have
now
to
confess
to
you
remain
sir
he
added
to
aramis
who
had
moved
to
leave
the
room
remain
parry
i
have
nothing
to
say
that
can
not
be
said
before
juxon
sat
down
and
the
king
kneeling
humbly
before
him
began
his
confession
remember
the
mob
had
already
assembled
when
the
confession
terminated
the
king
s
children
next
arrived
the
princess
charlotte
a
beautiful
child
with
tears
in
her
eyes
and
the
duke
of
gloucester
a
boy
eight
or
nine
years
old
whose
tearless
eyes
and
curling
lip
revealed
a
growing
pride
he
had
wept
all
night
long
but
would
not
show
his
grief
before
the
people
charles
s
heart
melted
within
him
at
the
sight
of
those
two
children
whom
he
had
not
seen
for
two
years
and
whom
he
now
met
at
the
moment
of
death
he
turned
to
brush
away
a
tear
and
then
summoning
up
all
his
firmness
drew
his
daughter
toward
him
recommending
her
to
be
pious
and
resigned
then
he
took
the
boy
upon
his
knee
my
son
he
said
to
him
you
saw
a
great
number
of
people
in
the
streets
as
you
came
here
these
men
are
going
to
behead
your
father
do
not
forget
that
perhaps
some
day
they
will
want
to
make
you
king
instead
of
the
prince
of
wales
or
the
duke
of
york
your
elder
brothers
but
you
are
not
the
king
my
son
and
can
never
be
so
while
they
are
alive
swear
to
me
then
never
to
let
them
put
a
crown
upon
your
head
unless
you
have
a
legal
right
to
the
crown
for
one
day
listen
my
son
one
day
if
you
do
so
they
will
doom
you
to
destruction
head
and
crown
too
and
then
you
will
not
be
able
to
die
with
a
calm
conscience
as
i
die
swear
my
the
child
stretched
out
his
little
hand
toward
that
of
his
father
and
said
i
swear
to
your
henry
said
charles
call
me
your
father
replied
the
child
i
swear
to
you
that
they
shall
kill
me
sooner
than
make
me
good
my
child
now
kiss
me
and
you
too
charlotte
never
forget
oh
never
never
cried
both
the
children
throwing
their
arms
around
their
father
s
neck
farewell
said
charles
farewell
my
children
take
them
away
juxon
their
tears
will
deprive
me
of
the
courage
to
juxon
led
them
away
and
this
time
the
doors
were
left
open
meanwhile
athos
in
his
concealment
waited
in
vain
the
signal
to
recommence
his
work
two
long
hours
he
waited
in
terrible
inaction
a
deathlike
silence
reigned
in
the
room
above
at
last
he
determined
to
discover
the
cause
of
this
stillness
he
crept
from
his
hole
and
stood
hidden
by
the
black
drapery
beneath
the
scaffold
peeping
out
from
the
drapery
he
could
see
the
rows
of
halberdiers
and
musketeers
around
the
scaffold
and
the
first
ranks
of
the
populace
swaying
and
groaning
like
the
sea
what
is
the
matter
then
he
asked
himself
trembling
more
than
the
cloth
he
was
holding
back
the
people
are
hurrying
on
the
soldiers
under
arms
and
among
the
spectators
i
see
d
artagnan
what
is
he
waiting
for
what
is
he
looking
at
good
god
have
they
allowed
the
headsman
to
escape
suddenly
the
dull
beating
of
muffled
drums
filled
the
square
the
sound
of
heavy
steps
was
heard
above
his
head
the
next
moment
the
very
planks
of
the
scaffold
creaked
with
the
weight
of
an
advancing
procession
and
the
eager
faces
of
the
spectators
confirmed
what
a
last
hope
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
had
prevented
him
till
then
believing
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
above
him
pronounced
these
words
colonel
i
want
to
speak
to
the
athos
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
it
was
the
king
speaking
on
the
scaffold
in
fact
after
taking
a
few
drops
of
wine
and
a
piece
of
bread
charles
weary
of
waiting
for
death
had
suddenly
decided
to
go
to
meet
it
and
had
given
the
signal
for
movement
then
the
two
wings
of
the
window
facing
the
square
had
been
thrown
open
and
the
people
had
seen
silently
advancing
from
the
interior
of
the
vast
chamber
first
a
masked
man
who
carrying
an
axe
in
his
hand
was
recognized
as
the
executioner
he
approached
the
block
and
laid
his
axe
upon
it
behind
him
pale
indeed
but
marching
with
a
firm
step
was
charles
stuart
who
advanced
between
two
priests
followed
by
a
few
superior
officers
appointed
to
preside
at
the
execution
and
attended
by
two
files
of
partisans
who
took
their
places
on
opposite
sides
of
the
scaffold
the
sight
of
the
masked
man
gave
rise
to
a
prolonged
sensation
every
one
was
full
of
curiosity
as
to
who
that
unknown
executioner
could
be
who
presented
himself
so
opportunely
to
assure
to
the
people
the
promised
spectacle
when
the
people
believed
it
had
been
postponed
until
the
following
day
all
gazed
at
him
searchingly
but
they
could
discern
nothing
but
a
man
of
middle
height
dressed
in
black
apparently
of
a
certain
age
for
the
end
of
a
gray
beard
peeped
out
from
the
bottom
of
the
mask
that
hid
his
features
the
king
s
request
had
undoubtedly
been
acceded
to
by
an
affirmative
sign
for
in
firm
sonorous
accents
which
vibrated
in
the
depths
of
athos
s
heart
the
king
began
his
speech
explaining
his
conduct
and
counseling
the
welfare
of
the
kingdom
oh
said
athos
to
himself
is
it
indeed
possible
that
i
hear
what
i
hear
and
that
i
see
what
i
see
is
it
possible
that
god
has
abandoned
his
representative
on
earth
and
left
him
to
die
thus
miserably
and
i
have
not
seen
him
i
have
not
said
adieu
to
him
a
noise
was
heard
like
that
the
instrument
of
death
would
make
if
moved
upon
the
block
do
not
touch
the
axe
said
the
king
and
resumed
his
speech
at
the
end
of
his
speech
the
king
looked
tenderly
around
upon
the
people
then
unfastening
the
diamond
ornament
which
the
queen
had
sent
him
he
placed
it
in
the
hands
of
the
priest
who
accompanied
juxon
then
he
drew
from
his
breast
a
little
cross
set
in
diamonds
which
like
the
order
had
been
the
gift
of
henrietta
maria
sir
said
he
to
the
priest
i
shall
keep
this
cross
in
my
hand
till
the
last
moment
take
it
from
me
when
i
am
yes
sire
said
a
voice
which
athos
recognized
as
that
of
aramis
he
then
took
his
hat
from
his
head
and
threw
it
on
the
ground
one
by
one
he
undid
the
buttons
of
his
doublet
took
it
off
and
deposited
it
by
the
side
of
his
hat
then
as
it
was
cold
he
asked
for
his
gown
which
was
brought
to
him
all
the
preparations
were
made
with
a
frightful
calmness
one
would
have
thought
the
king
was
going
to
bed
and
not
to
his
coffin
will
these
be
in
your
way
he
said
to
the
executioner
raising
his
long
locks
if
so
they
can
be
tied
charles
accompanied
these
words
with
a
look
designed
to
penetrate
the
mask
of
the
unknown
headsman
his
calm
noble
gaze
forced
the
man
to
turn
away
his
head
but
after
the
searching
look
of
the
king
he
encountered
the
burning
eyes
of
aramis
the
king
seeing
that
he
did
not
reply
repeated
his
question
it
will
do
replied
the
man
in
a
tremulous
voice
if
you
separate
them
across
the
the
king
parted
his
hair
with
his
hands
and
looking
at
the
block
he
said
this
block
is
very
low
is
there
no
other
to
be
had
it
is
the
usual
block
answered
the
man
in
the
mask
do
you
think
you
can
behead
me
with
a
single
blow
asked
the
king
i
hope
so
was
the
reply
there
was
something
so
strange
in
these
three
words
that
everybody
except
the
king
shuddered
i
do
not
wish
to
be
taken
by
surprise
added
the
king
i
shall
kneel
down
to
pray
do
not
strike
when
shall
i
strike
when
i
shall
lay
my
head
on
the
block
and
say
remember
then
strike
gentlemen
said
the
king
to
those
around
him
i
leave
you
to
brave
the
tempest
i
go
before
you
to
a
kingdom
which
knows
no
storms
he
looked
at
aramis
and
made
a
special
sign
to
him
with
his
head
now
he
continued
withdraw
a
little
and
let
me
say
my
prayer
i
beseech
you
you
also
stand
aside
he
said
to
the
masked
man
it
is
only
for
a
moment
and
i
know
that
i
belong
to
you
but
remember
that
you
are
not
to
strike
till
i
give
the
then
he
knelt
down
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
lowering
his
face
to
the
planks
as
if
he
would
have
kissed
them
said
in
a
low
tone
in
french
comte
de
la
fere
are
you
there
yes
your
majesty
he
answered
trembling
faithful
friend
noble
heart
said
the
king
i
should
not
have
been
rescued
i
have
addressed
my
people
and
i
have
spoken
to
god
last
of
all
i
speak
to
you
to
maintain
a
cause
which
i
believed
sacred
i
have
lost
the
throne
and
my
children
their
inheritance
a
million
in
gold
remains
it
is
buried
in
the
cellars
of
newcastle
keep
you
only
know
that
this
money
exists
make
use
of
it
then
whenever
you
think
it
will
be
most
useful
for
my
eldest
son
s
welfare
and
now
farewell
saintly
martyred
majesty
lisped
athos
chilled
with
terror
a
moment
s
silence
ensued
and
then
in
a
full
sonorous
voice
the
king
exclaimed
remember
he
had
scarcely
uttered
the
word
when
a
heavy
blow
shook
the
scaffold
and
where
athos
stood
immovable
a
warm
drop
fell
upon
his
brow
he
reeled
back
with
a
shudder
and
the
same
moment
the
drops
became
a
crimson
cataract
athos
fell
on
his
knees
and
remained
some
minutes
as
if
bewildered
or
stunned
at
last
he
rose
and
taking
his
handkerchief
steeped
it
in
the
blood
of
the
martyred
king
then
as
the
crowd
gradually
dispersed
he
leaped
down
crept
from
behind
the
drapery
glided
between
two
horses
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
was
the
first
to
arrive
at
the
inn
having
gained
his
room
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
face
and
observing
that
his
fingers
were
covered
with
the
monarch
s
blood
fell
down
insensible
the
man
in
the
mask
the
snow
was
falling
thick
and
icy
aramis
was
the
next
to
come
in
and
to
discover
athos
almost
insensible
but
at
the
first
words
he
uttered
the
comte
roused
himself
from
the
kind
of
lethargy
in
which
he
had
sunk
well
said
aramis
beaten
by
fate
beaten
said
athos
noble
and
unhappy
king
are
you
wounded
cried
aramis
no
this
is
his
where
were
you
then
where
you
left
me
under
the
did
you
see
it
all
no
but
i
heard
all
god
preserve
me
from
another
such
hour
as
i
have
just
then
you
know
that
i
did
not
leave
him
i
heard
your
voice
up
to
the
last
here
is
the
order
he
gave
me
and
the
cross
i
took
from
his
hand
he
desired
they
should
be
returned
to
the
then
here
is
a
handkerchief
to
wrap
them
in
replied
athos
drawing
from
his
pocket
the
one
he
had
steeped
in
the
king
s
blood
and
what
he
continued
has
been
done
with
the
poor
body
by
order
of
cromwell
royal
honors
will
be
accorded
to
it
the
doctors
are
embalming
the
corpse
and
when
it
is
ready
it
will
be
placed
in
a
lighted
mockery
muttered
athos
savagely
royal
honors
to
one
whom
they
have
murdered
well
cheer
up
said
a
loud
voice
from
the
staircase
which
porthos
had
just
mounted
we
are
all
mortal
my
poor
you
are
late
my
dear
yes
there
were
some
people
on
the
way
who
delayed
me
the
wretches
were
dancing
i
took
one
of
them
by
the
throat
and
throttled
him
just
then
a
patrol
rode
up
luckily
the
man
i
had
had
most
to
do
with
was
some
minutes
before
he
could
speak
so
i
took
advantage
of
his
silence
to
walk
have
you
seen
d
artagnan
we
got
separated
in
the
crowd
and
i
could
not
find
him
oh
said
athos
satirically
i
saw
him
he
was
in
the
front
row
of
the
crowd
admirably
placed
for
seeing
and
as
on
the
whole
the
sight
was
curious
he
probably
wished
to
stay
to
the
ah
comte
de
la
fere
said
a
calm
voice
though
hoarse
with
running
is
it
your
habit
to
calumniate
the
absent
this
reproof
stung
athos
to
the
heart
but
as
the
impression
produced
by
seeing
d
artagnan
foremost
in
a
coarse
ferocious
crowd
had
been
very
strong
he
contented
himself
with
replying
i
am
not
calumniating
you
my
friend
they
were
anxious
about
you
here
i
simply
told
them
where
you
were
you
didn
t
know
king
charles
to
you
he
was
only
a
foreigner
and
you
were
not
obliged
to
love
so
saying
he
stretched
out
his
hand
but
the
other
pretended
not
to
see
it
and
he
let
it
drop
again
slowly
by
his
side
ugh
i
am
tired
cried
d
artagnan
sitting
down
drink
a
glass
of
port
said
aramis
it
will
refresh
yes
let
us
drink
said
athos
anxious
to
make
it
up
by
hobnobbing
with
d
artagnan
let
us
drink
and
get
away
from
this
hateful
country
the
felucca
is
waiting
for
us
you
know
let
us
leave
we
have
nothing
more
to
do
you
are
in
a
hurry
sir
count
said
d
artagnan
but
what
would
you
have
us
to
do
here
now
that
the
king
is
dead
go
sir
count
replied
d
artagnan
carelessly
you
see
nothing
to
keep
you
a
little
longer
in
england
well
for
my
part
i
a
bloodthirsty
ruffian
who
can
go
and
stand
close
to
a
scaffold
in
order
to
have
a
better
view
of
the
king
s
execution
i
athos
turned
pale
every
reproach
his
friend
uttered
struck
deeply
in
his
heart
ah
you
remain
in
london
said
porthos
yes
and
you
hang
it
said
porthos
a
little
perplexed
between
the
two
i
suppose
as
i
came
with
you
i
must
go
away
with
you
i
can
t
leave
you
alone
in
this
abominable
thanks
my
worthy
friend
so
i
have
a
little
adventure
to
propose
to
you
when
the
count
is
gone
i
want
to
find
out
who
was
the
man
in
the
mask
who
so
obligingly
offered
to
cut
the
king
s
a
man
in
a
mask
cried
athos
you
did
not
let
the
executioner
escape
then
the
executioner
is
still
in
the
cellar
where
i
presume
he
has
had
an
interview
with
mine
host
s
bottles
but
you
remind
me
mousqueton
sir
answered
a
voice
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
let
out
your
prisoner
all
is
but
said
athos
who
is
the
wretch
that
has
dared
to
raise
his
hand
against
his
king
an
amateur
headsman
replied
aramis
who
however
does
not
handle
the
axe
did
you
not
see
his
face
asked
athos
he
wore
a
but
you
aramis
who
were
close
to
him
i
could
see
nothing
but
a
gray
beard
under
the
fringe
of
the
then
it
must
be
a
man
of
a
certain
oh
said
d
artagnan
that
matters
little
when
one
puts
on
a
mask
it
is
not
difficult
to
wear
a
beard
under
i
am
sorry
i
did
not
follow
him
said
porthos
well
my
dear
porthos
said
d
artagnan
that
s
the
very
thing
it
came
into
my
head
to
athos
understood
all
now
pardon
me
d
artagnan
he
said
i
have
distrusted
god
i
could
the
more
easily
distrust
you
pardon
me
my
we
will
see
about
that
presently
said
d
artagnan
with
a
slight
smile
well
then
said
aramis
well
while
i
was
watching
not
the
king
as
monsieur
le
comte
thinks
for
i
know
what
it
is
to
see
a
man
led
to
death
and
though
i
ought
to
be
accustomed
to
the
sight
it
always
makes
me
ill
while
i
was
watching
the
masked
executioner
the
idea
came
to
me
as
i
said
to
find
out
who
he
was
now
as
we
are
wont
to
complete
ourselves
each
by
all
the
rest
and
to
depend
on
one
another
for
assistance
as
one
calls
his
other
hand
to
aid
the
first
i
looked
around
instinctively
to
see
if
porthos
was
there
for
i
had
seen
you
aramis
with
the
king
and
you
count
i
knew
would
be
under
the
scaffold
and
for
that
reason
i
forgive
you
he
added
offering
athos
his
hand
for
you
must
have
suffered
much
i
was
looking
around
for
porthos
when
i
saw
near
me
a
head
which
had
been
broken
but
which
for
better
or
worse
had
been
patched
with
plaster
and
with
black
silk
humph
thought
i
that
looks
like
my
handiwork
i
fancy
i
must
have
mended
that
skull
somewhere
or
and
in
fact
it
was
that
unfortunate
scotchman
parry
s
brother
you
know
on
whom
groslow
amused
himself
by
trying
his
strength
well
this
man
was
making
signs
to
another
at
my
left
and
turning
around
i
recognized
the
honest
grimaud
oh
said
i
to
him
grimaud
turned
round
with
a
jerk
recognized
me
and
pointed
to
the
man
in
the
mask
eh
said
he
which
meant
do
you
see
him
parbleu
i
answered
and
we
perfectly
understood
one
another
well
everything
was
finished
as
you
know
the
mob
dispersed
i
made
a
sign
to
grimaud
and
the
scotchman
and
we
all
three
retired
into
a
corner
of
the
square
i
saw
the
executioner
return
into
the
king
s
room
change
his
clothes
put
on
a
black
hat
and
a
large
cloak
and
disappear
five
minutes
later
he
came
down
the
grand
you
followed
him
cried
athos
i
should
think
so
but
not
without
difficulty
every
few
minutes
he
turned
around
and
thus
obliged
us
to
conceal
ourselves
i
might
have
gone
up
to
him
and
killed
him
but
i
am
not
selfish
and
i
thought
it
might
console
you
all
a
little
to
have
a
share
in
the
matter
so
we
followed
him
through
the
lowest
streets
in
the
city
and
in
half
an
hour
s
time
he
stopped
before
a
little
isolated
house
grimaud
drew
out
a
pistol
eh
said
he
showing
it
i
held
back
his
arm
the
man
in
the
mask
stopped
before
a
low
door
and
drew
out
a
key
but
before
he
placed
it
in
the
lock
he
turned
around
to
see
if
he
was
being
followed
grimaud
and
i
got
behind
a
tree
and
the
scotchman
having
nowhere
to
hide
himself
threw
himself
on
his
face
in
the
road
next
moment
the
door
opened
and
the
man
the
scoundrel
said
aramis
while
you
have
been
returning
hither
he
will
have
escaped
and
we
shall
never
find
come
now
aramis
said
d
artagnan
you
must
be
taking
me
for
some
one
nevertheless
said
athos
in
your
absence
well
in
my
absence
haven
t
i
put
in
my
place
grimaud
and
the
scotchman
before
he
had
taken
ten
steps
beyond
the
door
i
had
examined
the
house
on
all
sides
at
one
of
the
doors
that
by
which
he
had
entered
i
placed
our
scotchman
making
a
sign
to
him
to
follow
the
man
wherever
he
might
go
if
he
came
out
again
then
going
around
the
house
i
placed
grimaud
at
the
other
exit
and
here
i
am
our
game
is
beaten
up
now
for
the
athos
threw
himself
into
d
artagnan
s
arms
friend
he
said
you
have
been
too
good
in
pardoning
me
i
was
wrong
a
hundred
times
wrong
i
ought
to
have
known
you
better
by
this
time
but
we
are
all
possessed
of
a
malignant
spirit
which
bids
us
humph
said
porthos
don
t
you
think
the
executioner
might
be
master
cromwell
who
to
make
sure
of
this
affair
undertook
it
himself
ah
just
so
cromwell
is
stout
and
short
and
this
man
thin
and
lanky
rather
tall
than
some
condemned
soldier
perhaps
suggested
athos
whom
they
have
pardoned
at
the
price
of
no
no
continued
d
artagnan
it
was
not
the
measured
step
of
a
foot
soldier
nor
was
it
the
gait
of
a
horseman
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
have
to
do
with
a
a
gentleman
exclaimed
athos
impossible
it
would
be
a
dishonor
to
all
the
fine
sport
by
jove
cried
porthos
with
a
laugh
that
shook
the
windows
fine
sport
are
you
still
bent
on
departure
athos
asked
d
artagnan
no
i
remain
replied
athos
with
a
threatening
gesture
that
promised
no
good
to
whomsoever
it
was
addressed
swords
then
cried
aramis
swords
let
us
not
lose
a
the
four
friends
resumed
their
own
clothes
girded
on
their
swords
ordered
mousqueton
and
blaisois
to
pay
the
bill
and
to
arrange
everything
for
immediate
departure
and
wrapped
in
their
large
cloaks
left
in
search
of
their
game
the
night
was
dark
snow
was
falling
the
streets
were
silent
and
deserted
d
artagnan
led
the
way
through
the
intricate
windings
and
narrow
alleys
of
the
city
and
ere
long
they
had
reached
the
house
in
question
for
a
moment
d
artagnan
thought
that
parry
s
brother
had
disappeared
but
he
was
mistaken
the
robust
scotchman
accustomed
to
the
snows
of
his
native
hills
had
stretched
himself
against
a
post
and
like
a
fallen
statue
insensible
to
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
had
allowed
the
snow
to
cover
him
he
rose
however
as
they
approached
come
said
athos
here
s
another
good
servant
really
honest
men
are
not
so
scarce
as
i
don
t
be
in
a
hurry
to
weave
crowns
for
our
scotchman
i
believe
the
fellow
is
here
on
his
own
account
for
i
have
heard
that
these
gentlemen
born
beyond
the
tweed
are
very
vindictive
i
should
not
like
to
be
groslow
if
he
meets
well
said
athos
to
the
man
in
english
no
one
has
come
out
he
replied
then
porthos
and
aramis
will
you
remain
with
this
man
while
we
go
around
to
grimaud
grimaud
had
made
himself
a
kind
of
sentry
box
out
of
a
hollow
willow
and
as
they
drew
near
he
put
his
head
out
and
gave
a
low
whistle
soho
cried
athos
yes
said
grimaud
well
has
anybody
come
out
no
but
somebody
has
gone
a
man
or
a
woman
a
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
there
are
two
of
them
then
i
wish
there
were
four
said
athos
the
two
parties
would
then
be
perhaps
there
are
four
said
d
artagnan
what
do
you
mean
other
men
may
have
entered
before
them
and
waited
for
we
can
find
out
said
grimaud
at
the
same
time
he
pointed
to
a
window
through
the
shutters
of
which
a
faint
light
streamed
that
is
true
said
d
artagnan
let
us
call
the
they
returned
around
the
house
to
fetch
porthos
and
aramis
have
you
seen
anything
they
asked
no
but
we
are
going
to
replied
d
artagnan
pointing
to
grimaud
who
had
already
climbed
some
five
or
six
feet
from
the
ground
all
four
came
up
together
grimaud
continued
to
climb
like
a
cat
and
succeeded
at
last
in
catching
hold
of
a
hook
which
served
to
keep
one
of
the
shutters
back
when
opened
then
resting
his
foot
on
a
small
ledge
he
made
a
sign
to
show
all
was
right
well
asked
d
artagnan
grimaud
showed
his
closed
hand
with
two
fingers
spread
out
speak
said
athos
we
can
not
see
your
signs
how
many
are
there
two
one
opposite
to
me
the
other
with
his
back
to
good
and
the
man
opposite
to
you
is
the
man
i
saw
go
do
you
know
him
i
thought
i
recognized
him
and
was
not
mistaken
short
and
who
is
it
they
all
asked
together
in
a
low
tone
general
oliver
the
four
friends
looked
at
one
another
and
the
other
asked
athos
thin
and
the
executioner
said
d
artagnan
and
aramis
at
the
same
time
i
can
see
nothing
but
his
back
resumed
grimaud
but
wait
he
is
moving
and
if
he
has
taken
off
his
mask
i
shall
be
able
to
see
ah
and
as
if
struck
in
the
heart
he
let
go
the
hook
and
dropped
with
a
groan
did
you
see
him
they
all
asked
yes
said
grimaud
with
his
hair
standing
on
end
the
thin
spare
man
the
executioner
in
short
asked
aramis
and
who
is
it
said
porthos
he
he
is
murmured
grimaud
pale
as
a
ghost
and
seizing
his
master
s
hand
who
he
asked
athos
mordaunt
replied
grimaud
d
artagnan
porthos
and
aramis
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
athos
stepped
back
and
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
fatality
he
muttered
cromwell
s
house
it
was
in
fact
mordaunt
whom
d
artagnan
had
followed
without
knowing
it
on
entering
the
house
he
had
taken
off
his
mask
and
imitation
beard
then
mounting
a
staircase
had
opened
a
door
and
in
a
room
lighted
by
a
single
lamp
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
man
seated
behind
a
desk
this
man
was
cromwell
cromwell
had
two
or
three
of
these
retreats
in
london
unknown
except
to
the
most
intimate
of
his
friends
mordaunt
was
among
these
it
is
you
mordaunt
he
said
you
are
general
i
wished
to
see
the
ceremony
to
the
end
which
delayed
ah
i
scarcely
thought
you
were
so
curious
as
i
am
always
curious
to
see
the
downfall
of
your
honor
s
enemies
and
he
was
not
among
the
least
of
them
but
you
general
were
you
not
at
whitehall
no
said
cromwell
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
have
you
had
any
account
of
it
none
i
have
been
here
since
the
morning
i
only
know
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
rescue
the
ah
you
knew
that
said
mordaunt
it
matters
little
four
men
disguised
as
workmen
were
to
get
the
king
out
of
prison
and
take
him
to
greenwich
where
a
vessel
was
and
knowing
all
that
your
honor
remained
here
far
from
the
city
tranquil
and
tranquil
yes
replied
cromwell
but
who
told
you
i
was
inactive
but
if
the
plot
had
succeeded
i
wished
it
to
do
i
thought
your
excellence
considered
the
death
of
charles
as
a
misfortune
necessary
to
the
welfare
of
yes
his
death
but
it
would
have
been
more
seemly
not
upon
the
why
so
asked
mordaunt
cromwell
smiled
because
it
could
have
been
said
that
i
had
had
him
condemned
for
the
sake
of
justice
and
had
let
him
escape
out
of
but
if
he
had
escaped
impossible
my
precautions
were
and
does
your
honor
know
the
four
men
who
undertook
to
rescue
him
the
four
frenchmen
of
whom
two
were
sent
by
the
queen
to
her
husband
and
two
by
mazarin
to
and
do
you
think
mazarin
commissioned
them
to
act
as
they
have
done
it
is
possible
but
he
will
not
avow
how
so
because
they
your
honor
gave
me
two
of
these
frenchmen
when
they
were
only
guilty
of
fighting
for
charles
i
now
that
they
are
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
against
england
will
your
honor
give
me
all
four
of
them
take
them
said
cromwell
mordaunt
bowed
with
a
smile
of
triumphant
ferocity
did
the
people
shout
at
all
cromwell
asked
very
little
except
long
live
cromwell
where
were
you
placed
mordaunt
tried
for
a
moment
to
read
in
the
general
s
face
if
this
was
simply
a
useless
question
or
whether
he
knew
everything
but
his
piercing
eyes
could
by
no
means
penetrate
the
sombre
depths
of
cromwell
s
i
was
so
situated
as
to
hear
and
see
everything
he
answered
it
was
now
cromwell
s
turn
to
look
fixedly
at
mordaunt
and
mordaunt
to
make
himself
impenetrable
it
appears
said
cromwell
that
this
improvised
executioner
did
his
duty
remarkably
well
the
blow
so
they
tell
me
at
least
was
struck
with
a
master
s
mordaunt
remembered
that
cromwell
had
told
him
he
had
had
no
detailed
account
and
he
was
now
quite
convinced
that
the
general
had
been
present
at
the
execution
hidden
behind
some
screen
or
curtain
in
fact
said
mordaunt
with
a
calm
voice
and
immovable
countenance
a
single
blow
perhaps
it
was
some
one
in
that
occupation
said
cromwell
do
you
think
so
sir
he
did
not
look
like
an
and
who
else
save
an
executioner
would
have
wished
to
fill
that
horrible
office
but
said
mordaunt
it
might
have
been
some
personal
enemy
of
the
king
who
had
made
a
vow
of
vengeance
and
accomplished
it
in
this
way
perhaps
it
was
some
man
of
rank
who
had
grave
reasons
for
hating
the
fallen
king
and
who
learning
that
the
king
was
about
to
flee
and
escape
him
threw
himself
in
the
way
with
a
mask
on
his
face
and
an
axe
in
his
hand
not
as
substitute
for
the
executioner
but
as
an
ambassador
of
and
if
that
were
the
case
would
your
honor
condemn
his
action
it
is
not
for
me
to
judge
it
rests
between
his
conscience
and
his
but
if
your
honor
knew
this
man
i
neither
know
nor
wish
to
know
him
provided
charles
is
dead
it
is
the
axe
not
the
man
we
must
and
yet
without
the
man
the
king
would
have
been
cromwell
smiled
they
would
have
carried
him
to
greenwich
he
said
and
put
him
on
board
a
felucca
with
five
barrels
of
powder
in
the
hold
once
out
to
sea
you
are
too
good
a
politician
not
to
understand
the
rest
yes
they
would
have
all
been
blown
just
so
the
explosion
would
have
done
what
the
axe
had
failed
to
do
men
would
have
said
that
the
king
had
escaped
human
justice
and
been
overtaken
by
god
s
you
see
now
why
i
did
not
care
to
know
your
gentleman
in
the
mask
for
really
in
spite
of
his
excellent
intentions
i
could
not
thank
him
for
what
he
has
mordaunt
bowed
humbly
sir
he
said
you
are
a
profound
thinker
and
your
plan
was
say
absurd
since
it
has
become
useless
the
only
sublime
ideas
in
politics
are
those
which
bear
fruit
so
mordaunt
go
to
greenwich
and
ask
for
the
captain
of
the
felucca
lightning
show
him
a
white
handkerchief
knotted
at
the
four
corners
and
tell
the
crew
to
disembark
and
carry
the
powder
back
to
the
arsenal
unless
indeed
unless
said
mordaunt
whose
face
was
lighted
by
a
savage
joy
as
cromwell
spoke
this
skiff
might
be
of
use
to
you
for
personal
oh
my
lord
my
lord
that
title
said
cromwell
laughing
is
all
very
well
here
but
take
care
a
word
like
that
does
not
escape
your
lips
in
but
your
honor
will
soon
be
called
so
i
hope
so
at
least
said
cromwell
rising
and
putting
on
his
cloak
you
are
going
sir
yes
said
cromwell
i
slept
here
last
night
and
the
night
before
and
you
know
it
is
not
my
custom
to
sleep
three
times
in
the
same
then
said
mordaunt
your
honor
gives
me
my
liberty
for
and
even
for
all
day
if
you
want
it
since
last
evening
he
added
smiling
you
have
done
enough
in
my
service
and
if
you
have
any
personal
matters
to
settle
it
is
just
that
i
should
give
you
thank
you
sir
it
will
be
well
employed
i
cromwell
turned
as
he
was
going
are
you
armed
he
asked
i
have
my
and
no
one
waiting
for
you
outside
then
you
had
better
come
with
thank
you
sir
but
the
way
by
the
subterranean
passage
would
take
too
much
time
and
i
have
none
to
cromwell
placed
his
hand
on
a
hidden
handle
and
opened
a
door
so
well
concealed
by
the
tapestry
that
the
most
practiced
eye
could
not
have
discovered
it
it
closed
after
him
with
a
spring
this
door
communicated
with
a
subterranean
passage
leading
under
the
street
to
a
grotto
in
the
garden
of
a
house
about
a
hundred
yards
from
that
of
the
future
protector
it
was
just
before
this
that
grimaud
had
perceived
the
two
men
seated
together
d
artagnan
was
the
first
to
recover
from
his
surprise
mordaunt
he
cried
ah
by
heaven
it
is
god
himself
who
sent
us
yes
said
porthos
let
us
break
the
door
in
and
fall
upon
no
replied
d
artagnan
no
noise
now
grimaud
you
come
here
climb
up
to
the
window
again
and
tell
us
if
mordaunt
is
alone
and
whether
he
is
preparing
to
go
out
or
go
to
bed
if
he
comes
out
we
shall
catch
him
if
he
stays
in
we
will
break
in
the
window
it
is
easier
and
less
noisy
than
the
grimaud
began
to
scale
the
wall
again
keep
guard
at
the
other
door
athos
and
aramis
porthos
and
i
will
stay
the
friends
obeyed
he
is
alone
said
grimaud
we
did
not
see
his
companion
come
he
may
have
gone
by
the
other
what
is
he
doing
putting
on
his
cloak
and
he
s
ours
muttered
d
artagnan
porthos
mechanically
drew
his
dagger
from
the
scabbard
put
it
up
again
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
we
must
proceed
in
an
orderly
hush
said
grimaud
he
is
coming
out
he
has
put
out
the
lamp
i
can
see
nothing
get
down
then
and
grimaud
leaped
down
the
snow
deadened
the
noise
of
his
fall
now
go
and
tell
athos
and
aramis
to
stand
on
each
side
of
the
door
and
clap
their
hands
if
they
catch
him
we
will
do
the
the
next
moment
the
door
opened
and
mordaunt
appeared
on
the
threshold
face
to
face
with
d
artagnan
porthos
clapped
his
hands
and
the
other
two
came
running
around
mordaunt
was
livid
but
he
uttered
no
cry
nor
called
for
assistance
d
artagnan
quietly
pushed
him
in
again
and
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
on
the
staircase
made
him
ascend
the
steps
backward
one
by
one
keeping
his
eyes
all
the
time
on
mordaunt
s
hands
who
however
knowing
that
it
was
useless
attempted
no
resistance
at
last
they
stood
face
to
face
in
the
very
room
where
ten
minutes
before
mordaunt
had
been
talking
to
cromwell
porthos
came
up
behind
and
unhooking
the
lamp
on
the
staircase
relit
that
in
the
room
athos
and
aramis
entered
last
and
locked
the
door
behind
them
oblige
me
by
taking
a
seat
said
d
artagnan
pushing
a
chair
toward
mordaunt
who
sat
down
pale
but
calm
aramis
porthos
and
d
artagnan
drew
their
chairs
near
him
athos
alone
kept
away
and
sat
in
the
furthest
corner
of
the
room
as
if
determined
to
be
merely
a
spectator
of
the
proceedings
he
seemed
to
be
quite
overcome
porthos
rubbed
his
hands
in
feverish
impatience
aramis
bit
his
lips
till
the
blood
came
d
artagnan
alone
was
calm
at
least
in
appearance
monsieur
mordaunt
he
said
since
after
running
after
one
another
so
long
chance
has
at
last
brought
us
together
let
us
have
a
little
conversation
if
you
conversational
though
mordaunt
had
been
so
completely
taken
by
surprise
and
had
mounted
the
stairs
in
such
utter
confusion
when
once
seated
he
recovered
himself
as
it
were
and
prepared
to
seize
any
possible
opportunity
of
escape
his
eye
wandered
to
a
long
stout
sword
on
his
flank
and
he
instinctively
slipped
it
around
within
reach
of
his
right
hand
d
artagnan
was
waiting
for
a
reply
to
his
remark
and
said
nothing
aramis
muttered
to
himself
we
shall
hear
nothing
but
the
usual
commonplace
porthos
sucked
his
mustache
muttering
a
good
deal
of
ceremony
about
crushing
an
athos
shrunk
into
his
corner
pale
and
motionless
as
a
the
silence
however
could
not
last
forever
so
d
artagnan
began
sir
he
said
with
desperate
politeness
it
seems
to
me
that
you
change
your
costume
almost
as
rapidly
as
i
have
seen
the
italian
mummers
do
whom
the
cardinal
mazarin
brought
over
from
bergamo
and
whom
he
doubtless
took
you
to
see
during
your
travels
in
mordaunt
did
not
reply
just
now
d
artagnan
continued
you
were
disguised
i
mean
to
say
attired
as
a
murderer
and
now
and
now
i
look
very
much
like
a
man
who
is
going
to
be
oh
sir
said
d
artagnan
how
can
you
talk
like
that
when
you
are
in
the
company
of
gentlemen
and
have
such
an
excellent
sword
at
your
side
no
sword
is
excellent
enough
to
be
of
use
against
four
swords
and
well
that
is
scarcely
the
question
i
had
the
honor
of
asking
you
why
you
altered
your
costume
the
mask
and
beard
became
you
very
well
and
as
to
the
axe
i
do
not
think
it
would
be
out
of
keeping
even
at
this
moment
why
then
have
you
laid
it
aside
because
remembering
the
scene
at
armentieres
i
thought
i
should
find
four
axes
for
one
as
i
was
to
meet
four
sir
replied
d
artagnan
in
the
calmest
manner
possible
you
are
very
young
i
shall
therefore
overlook
your
frivolous
remarks
what
took
place
at
armentieres
has
no
connection
whatever
with
the
present
occasion
we
could
scarcely
have
requested
your
mother
to
take
a
sword
and
fight
aha
it
is
a
duel
then
cried
mordaunt
as
if
disposed
to
reply
at
once
to
the
provocation
porthos
rose
always
ready
for
this
kind
of
adventure
pardon
me
said
d
artagnan
do
not
let
us
do
things
in
a
hurry
we
will
arrange
the
matter
rather
better
confess
monsieur
mordaunt
that
you
are
anxious
to
kill
some
of
all
replied
mordaunt
then
my
dear
sir
i
am
convinced
that
these
gentlemen
return
your
kind
wishes
and
will
be
delighted
to
kill
you
also
of
course
they
will
do
so
as
honorable
gentlemen
and
the
best
proof
i
can
furnish
is
this
so
saying
he
threw
his
hat
on
the
ground
pushed
back
his
chair
to
the
wall
and
bowed
to
mordaunt
with
true
french
grace
at
your
service
sir
he
continued
my
sword
is
shorter
than
yours
it
s
true
but
bah
i
think
the
arm
will
make
up
for
the
halt
cried
porthos
coming
forward
i
begin
and
without
any
allow
me
porthos
said
aramis
athos
did
not
move
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
statue
even
his
breathing
seemed
to
be
arrested
gentlemen
said
d
artagnan
you
shall
have
your
turn
monsieur
mordaunt
dislikes
you
sufficiently
not
to
refuse
you
afterward
you
can
see
it
in
his
eye
so
pray
keep
your
places
like
athos
whose
calmness
is
entirely
laudable
besides
we
will
have
no
words
about
it
i
have
particular
business
to
settle
with
this
gentleman
and
i
shall
and
will
porthos
and
aramis
drew
back
disappointed
and
drawing
his
sword
d
artagnan
turned
to
his
adversary
sir
i
am
waiting
for
and
for
my
part
gentlemen
i
admire
you
you
are
disputing
which
shall
fight
me
first
but
you
do
not
consult
me
who
am
most
concerned
in
the
matter
i
hate
you
all
but
not
equally
i
hope
to
kill
all
four
of
you
but
i
am
more
likely
to
kill
the
first
than
the
second
the
second
than
the
third
and
the
third
than
the
last
i
claim
then
the
right
to
choose
my
opponent
if
you
refuse
this
right
you
may
kill
me
but
i
shall
not
it
is
but
fair
said
porthos
and
aramis
hoping
he
would
choose
one
of
them
athos
and
d
artagnan
said
nothing
but
their
silence
seemed
to
imply
consent
well
then
said
mordaunt
i
choose
for
my
adversary
the
man
who
not
thinking
himself
worthy
to
be
called
comte
de
la
fere
calls
himself
athos
sprang
up
but
after
an
instant
of
motionless
silence
he
said
to
the
astonishment
of
his
friends
monsieur
mordaunt
a
duel
between
us
is
impossible
submit
this
honour
to
somebody
and
he
sat
down
ah
said
mordaunt
with
a
sneer
there
s
one
who
is
zounds
exclaimed
d
artagnan
bounding
toward
him
who
says
that
athos
is
afraid
let
him
have
his
say
d
artagnan
said
athos
with
a
smile
of
sadness
and
contempt
is
it
your
decision
athos
resumed
the
gascon
you
hear
sir
said
d
artagnan
turning
to
mordaunt
the
comte
de
la
fere
will
not
do
you
the
honor
of
fighting
with
you
choose
one
of
us
to
replace
the
comte
de
la
as
long
as
i
don
t
fight
with
him
it
is
the
same
to
me
with
whom
i
fight
put
your
names
into
a
hat
and
draw
a
good
idea
said
d
artagnan
at
least
that
will
conciliate
us
all
said
aramis
i
should
never
have
thought
of
that
said
porthos
and
yet
it
is
very
come
aramis
said
d
artagnan
write
this
for
us
in
those
neat
little
characters
in
which
you
wrote
to
marie
michon
that
the
mother
of
this
gentleman
intended
to
assassinate
the
duke
of
mordaunt
sustained
this
new
attack
without
wincing
he
stood
with
his
arms
folded
apparently
as
calm
as
any
man
could
be
in
such
circumstances
if
he
had
not
courage
he
had
what
is
very
like
it
namely
pride
aramis
went
to
cromwell
s
desk
tore
off
three
bits
of
paper
of
equal
size
wrote
on
the
first
his
own
name
and
on
the
others
those
of
his
two
companions
and
presented
them
open
to
mordaunt
who
by
a
movement
of
his
head
indicated
that
he
left
the
matter
entirely
to
aramis
he
then
rolled
them
separately
and
put
them
in
a
hat
which
he
handed
to
mordaunt
mordaunt
put
his
hand
into
the
hat
took
out
one
of
the
three
papers
and
disdainfully
dropped
it
on
the
table
without
reading
it
ah
serpent
muttered
d
artagnan
i
would
give
my
chance
of
a
captaincy
in
the
mousquetaires
for
that
to
be
my
aramis
opened
the
paper
and
in
a
voice
trembling
with
hate
and
vengeance
read
d
the
gascon
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
and
turning
to
mordaunt
i
hope
sir
said
he
you
have
no
objection
to
none
whatever
replied
the
other
drawing
his
sword
and
resting
the
point
on
his
boot
the
moment
that
d
artagnan
saw
that
his
wish
was
accomplished
and
his
man
would
not
escape
him
he
recovered
his
usual
tranquillity
he
turned
up
his
cuffs
neatly
and
rubbed
the
sole
of
his
right
boot
on
the
floor
but
did
not
fail
however
to
remark
that
mordaunt
was
looking
about
him
in
a
singular
manner
are
you
ready
sir
he
said
at
last
i
was
waiting
for
you
sir
said
mordaunt
raising
his
head
and
casting
at
his
opponent
a
look
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
well
then
said
the
gascon
take
care
of
yourself
for
i
am
not
a
bad
hand
at
the
nor
i
so
much
the
better
that
sets
my
mind
at
rest
defend
one
minute
said
the
young
man
give
me
your
word
gentlemen
that
you
will
not
attack
me
otherwise
than
one
after
the
is
it
to
have
the
pleasure
of
insulting
us
that
you
say
that
my
little
viper
no
but
to
set
my
mind
at
rest
as
you
observed
just
it
is
for
something
else
than
that
i
imagine
muttered
d
artagnan
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
on
the
honor
of
gentlemen
said
aramis
and
porthos
in
that
case
gentlemen
have
the
kindness
to
retire
into
the
corners
so
as
to
give
us
ample
room
we
shall
require
yes
gentlemen
said
d
artagnan
we
must
not
leave
this
person
the
slightest
pretext
for
behaving
badly
which
with
all
due
respect
i
fancy
he
is
anxious
still
to
this
new
attack
made
no
impression
on
mordaunt
the
space
was
cleared
the
two
lamps
placed
on
cromwell
s
desk
in
order
that
the
combatants
might
have
as
much
light
as
possible
and
the
swords
crossed
d
artagnan
was
too
good
a
swordsman
to
trifle
with
his
opponent
he
made
a
rapid
and
brilliant
feint
which
mordaunt
parried
aha
he
cried
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
and
without
losing
a
minute
thinking
he
saw
an
opening
he
thrust
his
right
in
and
forced
mordaunt
to
parry
a
counter
en
quarte
so
fine
that
the
point
of
the
weapon
might
have
turned
within
a
wedding
ring
this
time
it
was
mordaunt
who
smiled
ah
sir
said
d
artagnan
you
have
a
wicked
smile
it
must
have
been
the
devil
who
taught
it
you
was
it
not
mordaunt
replied
by
trying
his
opponent
s
weapon
with
an
amount
of
strength
which
the
gascon
was
astonished
to
find
in
a
form
apparently
so
feeble
but
thanks
to
a
parry
no
less
clever
than
that
which
mordaunt
had
just
achieved
he
succeeded
in
meeting
his
sword
which
slid
along
his
own
without
touching
his
chest
mordaunt
rapidly
sprang
back
a
step
ah
you
lose
ground
you
are
turning
well
as
you
please
i
even
gain
something
by
it
for
i
no
longer
see
that
wicked
smile
of
yours
you
have
no
idea
what
a
false
look
you
have
particularly
when
you
are
afraid
look
at
my
eyes
and
you
will
see
what
no
has
ever
shown
you
a
frank
and
honorable
to
this
flow
of
words
not
perhaps
in
the
best
taste
but
characteristic
of
d
artagnan
whose
principal
object
was
to
divert
his
opponent
s
attention
mordaunt
did
not
reply
but
continuing
to
turn
around
he
succeeded
in
changing
places
with
d
artagnan
he
smiled
more
and
more
sarcastically
and
his
smile
began
to
make
the
gascon
anxious
come
come
cried
d
artagnan
we
must
finish
with
this
and
in
his
turn
he
pressed
mordaunt
hard
who
continued
to
lose
ground
but
evidently
on
purpose
and
without
letting
his
sword
leave
the
line
for
a
moment
however
as
they
were
fighting
in
a
room
and
had
not
space
to
go
on
like
that
forever
mordaunt
s
foot
at
last
touched
the
wall
against
which
he
rested
his
left
hand
ah
this
time
you
can
not
lose
ground
my
fine
friend
exclaimed
d
artagnan
gentlemen
did
you
ever
see
a
scorpion
pinned
to
a
wall
no
well
then
you
shall
see
it
in
a
second
d
artagnan
had
made
three
terrible
thrusts
at
mordaunt
all
of
which
touched
but
only
pricked
him
the
three
friends
looked
on
panting
and
astonished
at
last
d
artagnan
having
got
up
too
close
stepped
back
to
prepare
a
fourth
thrust
but
the
moment
when
after
a
fine
quick
feint
he
was
attacking
as
sharply
as
lightning
the
wall
seemed
to
give
way
mordaunt
disappeared
through
the
opening
and
d
artagnan
s
blade
caught
between
the
panels
shivered
like
a
sword
of
glass
d
artagnan
sprang
back
the
wall
had
closed
again
mordaunt
in
fact
while
defending
himself
had
manoeuvred
so
as
to
reach
the
secret
door
by
which
cromwell
had
left
had
felt
for
the
knob
with
his
left
hand
pressed
it
and
disappeared
the
gascon
uttered
a
furious
imprecation
which
was
answered
by
a
wild
laugh
on
the
other
side
of
the
iron
panel
help
me
gentlemen
cried
d
artagnan
we
must
break
in
this
it
is
the
devil
in
person
said
aramis
hastening
forward
he
escapes
us
growled
porthos
pushing
his
huge
shoulder
against
the
hinges
but
in
vain
sblood
he
escapes
so
much
the
better
muttered
athos
i
thought
as
much
said
d
artagnan
wasting
his
strength
in
useless
efforts
zounds
i
thought
as
much
when
the
wretch
kept
moving
around
the
room
i
thought
he
was
up
to
it
s
a
misfortune
to
which
his
friend
the
devil
treats
us
said
aramis
it
s
a
piece
of
good
fortune
sent
from
heaven
said
athos
evidently
much
relieved
really
said
d
artagnan
abandoning
the
attempt
to
burst
open
the
panel
after
several
ineffectual
attempts
athos
i
can
not
imagine
how
you
can
talk
to
us
in
that
way
you
can
not
understand
the
position
we
are
in
in
this
kind
of
game
not
to
kill
is
to
let
one
s
self
be
killed
this
fox
of
a
fellow
will
be
sending
us
a
hundred
beasts
who
will
pick
us
off
like
sparrows
in
this
place
come
come
we
must
be
off
if
we
stay
here
five
minutes
more
there
s
an
end
of
yes
you
are
but
where
shall
we
go
asked
porthos
to
the
hotel
to
be
sure
to
get
our
baggage
and
horses
and
from
there
if
it
please
god
to
france
where
at
least
i
understand
the
architecture
of
the
so
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
d
artagnan
thrust
the
remnant
of
his
sword
into
its
scabbard
picked
up
his
hat
and
ran
down
the
stairs
followed
by
the
others
the
skiff
d
artagnan
had
judged
correctly
mordaunt
felt
that
he
had
no
time
to
lose
and
he
lost
none
he
knew
the
rapidity
of
decision
and
action
that
characterized
his
enemies
and
resolved
to
act
with
reference
to
that
this
time
the
musketeers
had
an
adversary
who
was
worthy
of
them
after
closing
the
door
carefully
behind
him
mordaunt
glided
into
the
subterranean
passage
sheathing
on
the
way
his
now
useless
sword
and
thus
reached
the
neighboring
house
where
he
paused
to
examine
himself
and
to
take
breath
good
he
said
nothing
almost
nothing
scratches
nothing
more
two
in
the
arm
and
one
in
the
breast
the
wounds
that
i
make
are
better
than
that
witness
the
executioner
of
bethune
my
uncle
and
king
charles
now
not
a
second
to
lose
for
a
second
lost
will
perhaps
save
them
they
must
die
die
all
together
killed
at
one
stroke
by
the
thunder
of
men
in
default
of
god
s
they
must
disappear
broken
scattered
annihilated
i
will
run
then
till
my
legs
no
longer
serve
till
my
heart
bursts
in
my
bosom
but
i
will
arrive
before
they
mordaunt
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
to
the
nearest
cavalry
barracks
about
a
quarter
of
a
league
distant
he
made
that
quarter
of
a
league
in
four
or
five
minutes
arrived
at
the
barracks
he
made
himself
known
took
the
best
horse
in
the
stables
mounted
and
gained
the
high
road
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
was
at
greenwich
there
is
the
port
he
murmured
that
dark
point
yonder
is
the
isle
of
dogs
good
i
am
half
an
hour
in
advance
of
them
an
hour
perhaps
fool
that
i
was
i
have
almost
killed
myself
by
my
needless
haste
now
he
added
rising
in
the
stirrups
and
looking
about
him
which
i
wonder
is
the
lightning
at
this
moment
as
if
in
reply
to
his
words
a
man
lying
on
a
coil
of
cables
rose
and
advanced
a
few
steps
toward
him
mordaunt
drew
a
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
and
tying
a
knot
at
each
corner
the
signal
agreed
upon
waved
it
in
the
air
and
the
man
came
up
to
him
he
was
wrapped
in
a
large
rough
cape
which
concealed
his
form
and
partly
his
face
do
you
wish
to
go
on
the
water
sir
said
the
sailor
yes
just
so
along
the
isle
of
and
perhaps
you
have
a
preference
for
one
boat
more
than
another
you
would
like
one
that
sails
as
rapidly
as
lightning
interrupted
mordaunt
then
mine
is
the
boat
you
want
sir
i
m
your
i
begin
to
think
so
particularly
if
you
have
not
forgotten
a
certain
here
it
is
sir
and
the
sailor
took
from
his
coat
a
handkerchief
tied
at
each
corner
good
quite
right
cried
mordaunt
springing
off
his
horse
there
s
not
a
moment
to
lose
now
take
my
horse
to
the
nearest
inn
and
conduct
me
to
your
but
asked
the
sailor
where
are
your
companions
i
thought
there
were
four
of
listen
to
me
sir
i
m
not
the
man
you
take
me
for
you
are
in
captain
rogers
s
post
are
you
not
under
orders
from
general
cromwell
mine
also
are
from
him
indeed
sir
i
recognize
you
you
are
captain
mordaunt
was
startled
oh
fear
nothing
said
the
skipper
showing
his
face
i
am
a
captain
groslow
cried
mordaunt
himself
the
general
remembered
that
i
had
formerly
been
a
naval
officer
and
he
gave
me
the
command
of
this
expedition
is
there
anything
new
in
the
wind
i
thought
perhaps
that
the
king
s
death
has
only
hastened
their
flight
in
ten
minutes
they
will
perhaps
be
what
have
you
come
for
then
to
embark
with
ah
ah
the
general
doubted
my
fidelity
no
but
i
wish
to
have
a
share
in
my
revenge
haven
t
you
some
one
who
will
relieve
me
of
my
horse
groslow
whistled
and
a
sailor
appeared
patrick
said
groslow
take
this
horse
to
the
stables
of
the
nearest
inn
if
any
one
asks
you
whose
it
is
you
can
say
that
it
belongs
to
an
irish
the
sailor
departed
without
reply
now
said
mordaunt
are
you
not
afraid
that
they
will
recognize
you
there
is
no
danger
dressed
as
i
am
in
this
pilot
coat
on
a
night
as
dark
as
this
besides
even
you
didn
t
recognize
me
they
will
be
much
less
likely
that
is
true
said
mordaunt
and
they
will
be
far
from
thinking
of
you
everything
is
ready
is
it
not
the
cargo
on
board
five
full
casks
and
fifty
empty
we
are
carrying
port
wine
to
excellent
now
take
me
aboard
and
return
to
your
post
for
they
will
soon
be
i
am
it
is
important
that
none
of
your
crew
should
see
i
have
but
one
man
on
board
and
i
am
as
sure
of
him
as
i
am
of
myself
besides
he
doesn
t
know
you
like
his
mates
he
is
ready
to
obey
our
orders
knowing
nothing
of
our
very
well
let
us
they
then
went
down
to
the
thames
a
boat
was
fastened
to
the
shore
by
a
chain
fixed
to
a
stake
groslow
jumped
in
followed
by
mordaunt
and
in
five
minutes
they
were
quite
away
from
that
world
of
houses
which
then
crowded
the
outskirts
of
london
and
mordaunt
could
discern
the
little
vessel
riding
at
anchor
near
the
isle
of
dogs
when
they
reached
the
side
of
this
felucca
mordaunt
dexterous
in
his
eagerness
for
vengeance
seized
a
rope
and
climbed
up
the
side
of
the
vessel
with
a
coolness
and
agility
very
rare
among
landsmen
he
went
with
groslow
to
the
captain
s
berth
a
sort
of
temporary
cabin
of
planks
for
the
chief
apartment
had
been
given
up
by
captain
rogers
to
the
passengers
who
were
to
be
accommodated
at
the
other
end
of
the
boat
they
will
have
nothing
to
do
then
at
this
end
said
mordaunt
nothing
at
that
s
a
capital
arrangement
return
to
greenwich
and
bring
them
here
i
shall
hide
myself
in
your
cabin
you
have
a
longboat
that
in
which
we
it
appeared
light
and
well
quite
a
fasten
it
to
the
poop
with
a
rope
put
the
oars
into
it
so
that
it
may
follow
in
the
track
and
there
will
be
nothing
to
do
except
to
cut
the
cord
put
a
good
supply
of
rum
and
biscuit
in
it
for
the
seamen
should
the
night
happen
to
be
stormy
they
will
not
be
sorry
to
find
something
to
console
themselves
consider
all
this
done
do
you
wish
to
see
the
no
when
you
return
i
will
set
the
fuse
myself
but
be
careful
to
conceal
your
face
so
that
you
can
not
be
recognized
by
never
there
s
ten
o
clock
striking
at
groslow
then
having
given
the
sailor
on
duty
an
order
to
be
on
the
watch
with
more
than
usual
vigilance
went
down
into
the
longboat
and
soon
reached
greenwich
the
wind
was
chilly
and
the
jetty
was
deserted
as
he
approached
it
but
he
had
no
sooner
landed
than
he
heard
a
noise
of
horses
galloping
upon
the
paved
road
these
horsemen
were
our
friends
or
rather
an
avant
garde
composed
of
d
artagnan
and
athos
as
soon
as
they
arrived
at
the
spot
where
groslow
stood
they
stopped
as
if
guessing
that
he
was
the
man
they
wanted
athos
alighted
and
calmly
opened
the
handkerchief
tied
at
each
corner
whilst
d
artagnan
ever
cautious
remained
on
horseback
one
hand
upon
his
pistol
leaning
forward
watchfully
on
seeing
the
appointed
signal
groslow
who
had
at
first
crept
behind
one
of
the
cannons
planted
on
that
spot
walked
straight
up
to
the
gentlemen
he
was
so
well
wrapped
up
in
his
cloak
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
see
his
face
even
if
the
night
had
not
been
so
dark
as
to
render
precaution
superfluous
nevertheless
the
keen
glance
of
athos
perceived
at
once
it
was
not
rogers
who
stood
before
them
what
do
you
want
with
us
he
asked
of
groslow
i
wish
to
inform
you
my
lord
replied
groslow
with
an
irish
accent
feigned
of
course
that
if
you
are
looking
for
captain
rogers
you
will
not
find
him
he
fell
down
this
morning
and
broke
his
leg
but
i
m
his
cousin
he
told
me
everything
and
desired
me
to
watch
instead
of
him
and
in
his
place
to
conduct
wherever
they
wished
to
go
the
gentlemen
who
should
bring
me
a
handkerchief
tied
at
each
corner
like
that
one
which
you
hold
and
one
which
i
have
in
my
and
he
drew
out
the
handkerchief
was
that
all
he
said
inquired
athos
no
my
lord
he
said
you
had
engaged
to
pay
seventy
pounds
if
i
landed
you
safe
and
sound
at
boulogne
or
any
other
port
you
choose
in
what
do
you
think
of
all
this
said
athos
in
a
low
tone
to
d
artagnan
after
explaining
to
him
in
french
what
the
sailor
had
said
in
english
it
seems
a
likely
story
to
and
to
me
besides
we
can
but
blow
out
his
brains
if
he
proves
false
said
the
gascon
and
you
athos
you
know
something
of
everything
and
can
be
our
captain
i
dare
say
you
know
how
to
navigate
should
he
fail
my
dear
friend
you
guess
well
my
father
meant
me
for
the
navy
and
i
have
some
vague
notions
about
you
see
cried
d
artagnan
they
then
summoned
their
friends
who
with
blaisois
mousqueton
and
grimaud
promptly
joined
them
leaving
parry
behind
them
who
was
to
take
back
to
london
the
horses
of
the
gentlemen
and
of
their
lackeys
which
had
been
sold
to
the
host
in
settlement
of
their
account
with
him
thanks
to
this
stroke
of
business
the
four
friends
were
able
to
take
away
with
them
a
sum
of
money
which
if
not
large
was
sufficient
as
a
provision
against
delays
and
accidents
parry
parted
from
his
friends
regretfully
they
had
proposed
his
going
with
them
to
france
but
he
had
straightway
declined
it
is
very
simple
mousqueton
had
said
he
is
thinking
of
it
was
captain
groslow
the
reader
will
remember
who
had
broken
parry
s
head
d
artagnan
resumed
immediately
the
attitude
of
distrust
that
was
habitual
with
him
he
found
the
wharf
too
completely
deserted
the
night
too
dark
the
captain
too
accommodating
he
had
reported
to
aramis
what
had
taken
place
and
aramis
not
less
distrustful
than
he
had
increased
his
suspicions
a
slight
click
of
the
tongue
against
his
teeth
informed
athos
of
the
gascon
s
uneasiness
we
have
no
time
now
for
suspicions
said
athos
the
boat
is
waiting
for
us
besides
said
aramis
what
prevents
our
being
distrustful
and
going
aboard
at
the
same
time
we
can
watch
the
and
if
he
doesn
t
go
straight
i
will
crush
him
that
s
well
said
porthos
replied
d
artagnan
let
us
go
then
you
first
mousqueton
and
he
stopped
his
friends
directing
the
valets
to
go
first
in
order
to
test
the
plank
leading
from
the
pier
to
the
boat
the
three
valets
passed
without
accident
athos
followed
them
then
porthos
then
aramis
d
artagnan
went
last
still
shaking
his
head
what
in
the
devil
is
the
matter
with
you
my
friend
said
porthos
upon
my
word
you
would
make
caesar
the
matter
is
replied
d
artagnan
that
i
can
see
upon
this
pier
neither
inspector
nor
sentinel
nor
and
you
complain
of
that
said
porthos
everything
goes
as
if
in
flowery
everything
goes
too
well
porthos
but
no
matter
we
must
trust
in
as
soon
as
the
plank
was
withdrawn
the
captain
took
his
place
at
the
tiller
and
made
a
sign
to
one
of
the
sailors
who
in
hand
began
to
push
out
from
the
labyrinth
of
boats
in
which
they
were
involved
the
other
sailor
had
already
seated
himself
on
the
port
side
and
was
ready
to
row
as
soon
as
there
was
room
for
rowing
his
companion
rejoined
him
and
the
boat
began
to
move
more
rapidly
at
last
we
are
off
exclaimed
porthos
alas
said
athos
we
depart
yes
but
all
four
together
and
without
a
scratch
which
is
a
we
are
not
yet
at
our
destination
observed
the
prudent
d
artagnan
beware
of
ah
my
friend
cried
porthos
like
the
crows
you
always
bring
bad
omens
who
could
intercept
us
on
such
a
night
as
this
pitch
dark
when
one
does
not
see
more
than
twenty
yards
before
one
yes
but
morning
we
shall
be
at
i
hope
so
with
all
my
heart
said
the
gascon
and
i
confess
my
weakness
yes
athos
you
may
laugh
but
as
long
as
we
were
within
gunshot
of
the
pier
or
of
the
vessels
lying
by
it
i
was
looking
for
a
frightful
discharge
of
musketry
which
would
crush
but
said
porthos
with
great
wisdom
that
was
impossible
for
they
would
have
killed
the
captain
and
the
bah
much
monsieur
mordaunt
would
care
you
don
t
imagine
he
would
consider
a
little
thing
like
that
at
any
rate
said
porthos
i
am
glad
to
hear
d
artagnan
admit
that
he
is
i
not
only
confess
it
but
am
proud
of
it
returned
the
gascon
i
m
not
such
a
rhinoceros
as
you
are
oho
what
s
that
the
lightning
answered
the
captain
our
so
far
so
good
laughed
athos
they
went
on
board
and
the
captain
instantly
conducted
them
to
the
berth
prepared
for
them
a
cabin
which
was
to
serve
for
all
purposes
and
for
the
whole
party
he
then
tried
to
slip
away
under
pretext
of
giving
orders
to
some
one
stop
a
moment
cried
d
artagnan
pray
how
many
men
have
you
on
board
captain
i
don
t
understand
was
the
reply
explain
it
groslow
on
the
question
being
interpreted
answered
three
without
counting
d
artagnan
understood
for
while
replying
the
captain
had
raised
three
fingers
oh
he
exclaimed
i
begin
to
be
more
at
my
ease
however
whilst
you
settle
yourselves
i
shall
make
the
round
of
the
as
for
me
said
porthos
i
will
see
to
the
a
very
good
idea
porthos
said
the
gascon
athos
lend
me
grimaud
who
in
the
society
of
his
friend
parry
has
perhaps
picked
up
a
little
english
and
can
act
as
my
go
grimaud
said
athos
d
artagnan
finding
a
lantern
on
the
deck
took
it
up
and
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
he
said
to
the
captain
in
english
come
being
with
the
classic
english
oath
the
only
english
words
he
knew
and
so
saying
he
descended
to
the
lower
deck
this
was
divided
into
three
compartments
one
which
was
covered
by
the
floor
of
that
room
in
which
athos
porthos
and
aramis
were
to
pass
the
night
the
second
was
to
serve
as
the
for
the
servants
the
third
under
the
prow
of
the
ship
was
under
the
temporary
cabin
in
which
mordaunt
was
concealed
oho
cried
d
artagnan
as
he
went
down
the
steps
of
the
hatchway
preceded
by
the
lantern
what
a
number
of
barrels
one
would
think
one
was
in
the
cave
of
ali
baba
what
is
there
in
them
he
added
putting
his
lantern
on
one
of
the
casks
the
captain
seemed
inclined
to
go
upon
deck
again
but
controlling
himself
he
answered
port
ah
port
wine
tis
a
comfort
said
the
gascon
since
we
shall
not
die
of
thirst
are
they
all
full
grimaud
translated
the
question
and
groslow
who
was
wiping
the
perspiration
from
off
his
forehead
answered
some
full
others
d
artagnan
struck
the
barrels
with
his
hand
and
having
ascertained
that
he
spoke
the
truth
pushed
his
lantern
greatly
to
the
captain
s
alarm
into
the
interstices
between
the
barrels
and
finding
that
there
was
nothing
concealed
in
them
come
along
he
said
and
he
went
toward
the
door
of
the
second
compartment
stop
said
the
englishman
i
have
the
key
of
that
door
and
he
opened
the
door
with
a
trembling
hand
into
the
second
compartment
where
mousqueton
and
blaisois
were
preparing
supper
here
there
was
evidently
nothing
to
seek
or
to
apprehend
and
they
passed
rapidly
to
examine
the
third
compartment
this
was
the
room
appropriated
to
the
sailors
two
or
three
hammocks
hung
upon
the
ceiling
a
table
and
two
benches
composed
the
entire
furniture
d
artagnan
picked
up
two
or
three
old
sails
hung
on
the
walls
and
meeting
nothing
to
suspect
regained
by
the
hatchway
the
deck
of
the
vessel
and
this
room
he
asked
pointing
to
the
captain
s
cabin
that
s
my
room
replied
groslow
open
the
the
captain
obeyed
d
artagnan
stretched
out
his
arm
in
which
he
held
the
lantern
put
his
head
in
at
the
half
opened
door
and
seeing
that
the
cabin
was
nothing
better
than
a
shed
good
he
said
if
there
is
an
army
on
board
it
is
not
here
that
it
is
hidden
let
us
see
what
porthos
has
found
for
and
thanking
the
captain
he
regained
the
state
cabin
where
his
friends
were
porthos
had
found
nothing
and
with
him
fatigue
had
prevailed
over
hunger
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
was
in
a
profound
slumber
when
d
artagnan
returned
athos
and
aramis
were
beginning
to
close
their
eyes
which
they
half
opened
when
their
companion
came
in
again
well
said
aramis
all
is
well
we
may
sleep
on
this
assurance
the
two
friends
fell
asleep
and
d
artagnan
who
was
very
weary
bade
to
grimaud
and
laid
himself
down
in
his
cloak
with
naked
sword
at
his
side
in
such
a
manner
that
his
body
barricaded
the
passage
and
it
should
be
impossible
to
enter
the
room
without
upsetting
him
port
wine
in
ten
minutes
the
masters
slept
not
so
the
servants
and
more
thirsty
than
hungry
blaisois
and
mousqueton
set
themselves
to
preparing
their
bed
which
consisted
of
a
plank
and
a
valise
on
a
hanging
table
which
swung
to
and
fro
with
the
rolling
of
the
vessel
were
a
pot
of
beer
and
three
glasses
this
cursed
rolling
said
blaisois
i
know
it
will
serve
me
as
it
did
when
we
came
and
to
think
said
mousqueton
that
we
have
nothing
to
fight
seasickness
with
but
barley
bread
and
hop
beer
pah
but
where
is
your
wicker
flask
monsieur
mousqueton
have
you
lost
it
asked
blaisois
no
replied
mousqueton
parry
kept
it
those
devilish
scotchmen
are
always
thirsty
and
you
grimaud
he
said
to
his
companion
who
had
just
come
in
after
his
round
with
d
artagnan
are
you
thirsty
as
thirsty
as
a
scotchman
was
grimaud
s
laconic
reply
and
he
sat
down
and
began
to
cast
up
the
accounts
of
his
party
whose
money
he
managed
oh
lackadaisy
i
m
beginning
to
feel
queer
cried
blaisois
if
that
s
the
case
said
mousqueton
with
a
learned
air
take
some
do
you
call
that
nourishment
said
blaisois
pointing
to
the
barley
bread
and
pot
of
beer
upon
the
table
blaisois
replied
mousqueton
remember
that
bread
is
the
true
nourishment
of
a
frenchman
who
is
not
always
able
to
get
bread
ask
yes
but
beer
asked
blaisois
sharply
is
that
their
true
drink
as
to
that
answered
mousqueton
puzzled
how
to
get
out
of
the
difficulty
i
must
confess
that
to
me
beer
is
as
disagreeable
as
wine
is
to
the
what
monsieur
mousqueton
the
english
do
they
dislike
wine
they
hate
but
i
have
seen
them
drink
as
a
punishment
for
example
an
english
prince
died
one
day
because
they
had
put
him
into
a
butt
of
malmsey
i
heard
the
chevalier
d
herblay
say
the
fool
cried
blaisois
i
wish
i
had
been
in
his
thou
canst
be
said
grimaud
writing
down
his
figures
how
asked
blaisois
i
can
explain
grimaud
went
on
with
his
sum
and
cast
up
the
whole
port
he
said
extending
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
first
compartment
examined
by
d
artagnan
and
himself
eh
eh
ah
those
barrels
i
saw
through
the
door
port
replied
grimaud
beginning
a
fresh
sum
i
have
heard
said
blaisois
that
port
is
a
very
good
excellent
exclaimed
mousqueton
smacking
his
lips
excellent
there
is
port
wine
in
the
cellar
of
monsieur
le
baron
de
suppose
we
ask
these
englishmen
to
sell
us
a
bottle
said
the
honest
blaisois
sell
cried
mousqueton
about
whom
there
was
a
remnant
of
his
ancient
marauding
character
left
one
may
well
perceive
young
man
that
you
are
inexperienced
why
buy
what
one
can
take
take
said
blaisois
covet
the
goods
of
your
neighbor
that
is
forbidden
it
seems
to
where
forbidden
asked
mousqueton
in
the
commandments
of
god
or
of
the
church
i
don
t
know
which
i
only
know
it
says
thou
shalt
not
covet
thy
neighbor
s
goods
nor
yet
his
that
is
a
child
s
reason
monsieur
blaisois
said
mousqueton
in
his
most
patronizing
manner
yes
you
talk
like
a
child
i
repeat
the
word
where
have
you
read
in
the
scriptures
i
ask
you
that
the
english
are
your
neighbors
where
that
is
true
said
blaisois
at
least
i
can
t
now
recall
a
child
s
reason
i
repeat
it
continued
mousqueton
if
you
had
been
ten
years
engaged
in
war
as
grimaud
and
i
have
been
my
dear
blaisois
you
would
know
the
difference
there
is
between
the
goods
of
others
and
the
goods
of
enemies
now
an
englishman
is
an
enemy
this
port
wine
belongs
to
the
english
therefore
it
belongs
to
and
our
masters
asked
blaisois
stupefied
by
this
harangue
delivered
with
an
air
of
profound
sagacity
will
they
be
of
your
opinion
mousqueton
smiled
disdainfully
i
suppose
that
you
think
it
necessary
that
i
should
disturb
the
repose
of
these
illustrious
lords
to
say
gentlemen
your
servant
mousqueton
is
what
does
monsieur
bracieux
care
think
you
whether
i
am
thirsty
or
not
tis
a
very
expensive
wine
said
blaisois
shaking
his
head
were
it
liquid
gold
monsieur
blaisois
our
masters
would
not
deny
themselves
this
wine
know
that
monsieur
de
bracieux
is
rich
enough
to
drink
a
tun
of
port
wine
even
if
obliged
to
pay
a
pistole
for
every
his
manner
became
more
and
more
lofty
every
instant
then
he
arose
and
after
finishing
off
the
beer
at
one
draught
he
advanced
majestically
to
the
door
of
the
compartment
where
the
wine
was
ah
locked
he
exclaimed
these
devils
of
english
how
suspicious
they
are
locked
said
blaisois
ah
the
deuce
it
is
unlucky
for
my
stomach
is
getting
more
and
more
locked
repeated
mousqueton
but
blaisois
ventured
to
say
i
have
heard
you
relate
monsieur
mousqueton
that
once
on
a
time
at
chantilly
you
fed
your
master
and
yourself
by
taking
partridges
in
a
snare
carp
with
a
line
and
bottles
with
a
perfectly
true
but
there
was
an
airhole
in
the
cellar
and
the
wine
was
in
bottles
i
can
not
throw
the
loop
through
this
partition
nor
move
with
a
a
cask
of
wine
which
may
perhaps
weigh
two
hundred
no
but
you
can
take
out
two
or
three
boards
of
the
partition
answered
blaisois
and
make
a
hole
in
the
cask
with
a
mousqueton
opened
his
great
round
eyes
to
the
utmost
astonished
to
find
in
blaisois
qualities
for
which
he
did
not
give
him
credit
tis
true
he
said
but
where
can
i
get
a
chisel
to
take
the
planks
out
a
gimlet
to
pierce
the
cask
trousers
said
grimaud
still
squaring
his
accounts
ah
yes
said
mousqueton
grimaud
in
fact
was
not
only
the
accountant
but
the
armorer
of
the
party
and
as
he
was
a
man
full
of
forethought
these
trousers
carefully
rolled
up
in
his
valise
contained
every
sort
of
tool
for
immediate
use
mousqueton
therefore
was
soon
provided
with
tools
and
he
began
his
task
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
extracted
three
boards
he
tried
to
pass
his
body
through
the
aperture
but
not
being
like
the
frog
in
the
fable
who
thought
he
was
larger
than
he
really
was
he
found
he
must
take
out
three
or
four
more
before
he
could
get
through
he
sighed
and
set
to
work
again
grimaud
had
now
finished
his
accounts
he
arose
and
stood
near
mousqueton
i
he
said
what
said
mousqueton
i
can
that
is
true
said
mousqueton
glancing
at
his
friend
s
long
and
thin
body
you
will
pass
and
he
knows
the
full
casks
said
blaisois
for
he
has
already
been
in
the
hold
with
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
let
monsieur
grimaud
go
in
monsieur
i
could
go
in
as
well
as
grimaud
said
mousqueton
a
little
piqued
yes
but
that
would
take
too
much
time
and
i
am
thirsty
i
am
getting
more
and
more
go
in
then
grimaud
said
mousqueton
handing
him
the
beer
pot
and
gimlet
rinse
the
glasses
said
grimaud
then
with
a
friendly
gesture
toward
mousqueton
that
he
might
forgive
him
for
finishing
an
enterprise
so
brilliantly
begun
by
another
he
glided
like
a
serpent
through
the
opening
and
disappeared
blaisois
was
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
he
was
in
ecstasies
of
all
the
exploits
performed
since
their
arrival
in
england
by
the
extraordinary
men
with
whom
he
had
the
honor
to
be
associated
this
seemed
without
question
to
be
the
most
wonderful
you
are
about
to
see
said
mousqueton
looking
at
blaisois
with
an
expression
of
superiority
which
the
latter
did
not
even
think
of
questioning
you
are
about
to
see
blaisois
how
we
old
soldiers
drink
when
we
are
my
cloak
said
grimaud
from
the
bottom
of
the
hold
what
do
you
want
asked
blaisois
my
cloak
stop
up
the
aperture
with
why
asked
blaisois
simpleton
exclaimed
mousqueton
suppose
any
one
came
into
the
ah
true
cried
blaisois
with
evident
admiration
but
it
will
be
dark
in
the
grimaud
always
sees
dark
or
light
night
as
well
as
day
answered
mousqueton
that
is
lucky
said
blaisois
as
for
me
when
i
have
no
candle
i
can
t
take
two
steps
without
knocking
against
that
s
because
you
haven
t
served
said
mousqueton
had
you
been
in
the
army
you
would
have
been
able
to
pick
up
a
needle
on
the
floor
of
a
closed
oven
but
hark
i
think
some
one
is
mousqueton
made
with
a
low
whistling
sound
the
sign
of
alarm
well
known
to
the
lackeys
in
the
days
of
their
youth
resumed
his
place
at
the
table
and
made
a
sign
to
blaisois
to
follow
his
example
blaisois
obeyed
the
door
of
their
cabin
was
opened
two
men
wrapped
in
their
cloaks
appeared
oho
said
they
not
in
bed
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
that
s
against
all
rules
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
let
every
one
be
in
bed
and
these
two
men
then
went
toward
the
compartment
in
which
grimaud
was
secreted
opened
the
door
entered
and
shut
it
after
them
ah
cried
blaisois
he
is
lost
grimaud
s
a
cunning
fellow
murmured
mousqueton
they
waited
for
ten
minutes
during
which
time
no
noise
was
heard
that
might
indicate
that
grimaud
was
discovered
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
anxious
interval
the
two
men
returned
closed
the
door
after
them
and
repeating
their
orders
that
the
servants
should
go
to
bed
and
extinguish
their
lights
disappeared
shall
we
obey
asked
blaisois
all
this
looks
they
said
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
still
have
five
minutes
replied
mousqueton
suppose
we
warn
the
let
s
wait
for
but
perhaps
they
have
killed
grimaud
would
have
cried
you
know
he
is
almost
we
should
have
heard
the
blow
but
if
he
doesn
t
return
here
he
at
that
very
moment
grimaud
drew
back
the
cloak
which
hid
the
aperture
and
came
in
with
his
face
livid
his
eyes
staring
wide
open
with
terror
so
that
the
pupils
were
contracted
almost
to
nothing
with
a
large
circle
of
white
around
them
he
held
in
his
hand
a
tankard
full
of
a
dark
substance
and
approaching
the
gleam
of
light
shed
by
the
lamp
he
uttered
this
single
monosyllable
oh
with
such
an
expression
of
extreme
terror
that
mousqueton
started
alarmed
and
blaisois
was
near
fainting
from
fright
both
however
cast
an
inquisitive
glance
into
the
tankard
it
was
full
of
gunpowder
convinced
that
the
ship
was
full
of
powder
instead
of
having
a
cargo
of
wine
grimaud
hastened
to
awake
d
artagnan
who
had
no
sooner
beheld
him
than
he
perceived
that
something
extraordinary
had
taken
place
imposing
silence
grimaud
put
out
the
little
night
lamp
then
knelt
down
and
poured
into
the
lieutenant
s
ear
a
recital
melodramatic
enough
not
to
require
play
of
feature
to
give
it
pith
this
was
the
gist
of
his
strange
story
the
first
barrel
that
grimaud
had
found
on
passing
into
the
compartment
he
struck
it
was
empty
he
passed
on
to
another
it
also
was
empty
but
the
third
which
he
tried
was
from
the
dull
sound
it
gave
out
evidently
full
at
this
point
grimaud
stopped
and
was
preparing
to
make
a
hole
with
his
gimlet
when
he
found
a
spigot
he
therefore
placed
his
tankard
under
it
and
turned
the
spout
something
whatever
it
was
the
cask
contained
fell
silently
into
the
tankard
whilst
he
was
thinking
that
he
should
first
taste
the
liquor
which
the
tankard
contained
before
taking
it
to
his
companions
the
door
of
the
cellar
opened
and
a
man
with
a
lantern
in
his
hands
and
enveloped
in
a
cloak
came
and
stood
just
before
the
hogshead
behind
which
grimaud
on
hearing
him
come
in
instantly
crept
this
was
groslow
he
was
accompanied
by
another
man
who
carried
in
his
hand
something
long
and
flexible
rolled
up
resembling
a
washing
line
his
face
was
hidden
under
the
wide
brim
of
his
hat
grimaud
thinking
that
they
had
come
as
he
had
to
try
the
port
wine
effaced
himself
behind
his
cask
and
consoled
himself
with
the
reflection
that
if
he
were
discovered
the
crime
was
not
a
great
one
have
you
the
wick
asked
the
one
who
carried
the
lantern
here
it
is
answered
the
other
at
the
voice
of
this
last
speaker
grimaud
started
and
felt
a
shudder
creeping
through
his
very
marrow
he
rose
gently
so
that
his
head
was
just
above
the
round
of
the
barrel
and
under
the
large
hat
he
recognized
the
pale
face
of
mordaunt
how
long
will
this
fuse
burn
asked
this
person
about
five
minutes
replied
the
captain
that
voice
also
was
known
to
grimaud
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
and
after
mordaunt
he
recognized
groslow
then
tell
the
men
to
be
in
readiness
don
t
tell
them
why
now
when
the
clock
strikes
a
quarter
after
midnight
collect
your
men
get
down
into
the
that
is
when
i
have
lighted
the
match
i
will
undertake
that
i
wish
to
be
sure
of
my
revenge
are
the
oars
in
the
boat
everything
is
tis
mordaunt
knelt
down
and
fastened
one
end
of
the
train
to
the
spigot
in
order
that
he
might
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
set
it
on
fire
at
the
opposite
end
with
the
match
he
then
arose
you
hear
me
at
a
quarter
past
midnight
in
fact
in
twenty
i
understand
all
perfectly
sir
replied
groslow
but
allow
me
to
say
there
is
great
danger
in
what
you
undertake
would
it
not
be
better
to
intrust
one
of
the
men
to
set
fire
to
the
train
my
dear
groslow
answered
mordaunt
you
know
the
french
proverb
nothing
one
does
not
do
one
s
self
is
ever
well
i
shall
abide
by
that
grimaud
had
heard
all
this
if
he
had
not
understood
it
but
what
he
saw
made
good
what
he
lacked
in
perfect
comprehension
of
the
language
he
had
seen
the
two
mortal
enemies
of
the
musketeers
had
seen
mordaunt
adjust
the
fuse
he
had
heard
the
proverb
which
mordaunt
had
given
in
french
then
he
felt
and
felt
again
the
contents
of
the
tankard
he
held
in
his
hand
and
instead
of
the
lively
liquor
expected
by
blaisois
and
mousqueton
he
found
beneath
his
fingers
the
grains
of
some
coarse
powder
mordaunt
went
away
with
the
captain
at
the
door
he
stopped
to
listen
do
you
hear
how
they
sleep
he
asked
in
fact
porthos
could
be
heard
snoring
through
the
partition
tis
god
who
gives
them
into
our
hands
answered
groslow
this
time
the
devil
himself
shall
not
save
them
rejoined
mordaunt
and
they
went
out
together
end
of
the
port
wine
mystery
grimaud
waited
till
he
heard
the
bolt
grind
in
the
lock
and
when
he
was
satisfied
that
he
was
alone
he
slowly
rose
from
his
recumbent
posture
ah
he
said
wiping
with
his
sleeve
large
drops
of
sweat
from
his
forehead
how
lucky
it
was
that
mousqueton
was
thirsty
he
made
haste
to
pass
out
by
the
opening
still
thinking
himself
in
a
dream
but
the
sight
of
the
gunpowder
in
the
tankard
proved
to
him
that
his
dream
was
a
fatal
nightmare
it
may
be
imagined
that
d
artagnan
listened
to
these
details
with
increasing
interest
before
grimaud
had
finished
he
rose
without
noise
and
putting
his
mouth
to
aramis
s
ear
and
at
the
same
time
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
to
prevent
a
sudden
movement
chevalier
he
said
get
up
and
don
t
make
the
least
aramis
awoke
d
artagnan
pressing
his
hand
repeated
his
call
aramis
obeyed
athos
is
near
you
said
d
artagnan
warn
him
as
i
have
warned
aramis
easily
aroused
athos
whose
sleep
was
light
like
that
of
all
persons
of
a
finely
organized
constitution
but
there
was
more
difficulty
in
arousing
porthos
he
was
beginning
to
ask
full
explanation
of
that
breaking
in
on
his
sleep
which
was
very
annoying
to
him
when
d
artagnan
instead
of
explaining
closed
his
mouth
with
his
hand
then
our
gascon
extending
his
arms
drew
to
him
the
heads
of
his
three
friends
till
they
almost
touched
one
another
friends
he
said
we
must
leave
this
craft
at
once
or
we
are
dead
bah
said
athos
are
you
still
afraid
do
you
know
who
is
captain
of
this
vessel
captain
the
shudder
of
the
three
musketeers
showed
to
d
artagnan
that
his
words
began
to
make
some
impression
on
them
groslow
said
aramis
the
devil
who
is
this
groslow
asked
porthos
i
don
t
remember
groslow
is
the
man
who
broke
parry
s
head
and
is
now
getting
ready
to
break
oh
oh
and
do
you
know
who
is
his
lieutenant
his
lieutenant
there
is
none
said
athos
they
don
t
have
lieutenants
in
a
felucca
manned
by
a
crew
of
yes
but
monsieur
groslow
is
not
a
captain
of
the
ordinary
kind
he
has
a
lieutenant
and
that
lieutenant
is
monsieur
this
time
the
musketeers
did
more
than
shudder
they
almost
cried
out
those
invincible
men
were
subject
to
a
mysterious
and
fatal
influence
which
that
name
had
over
them
the
mere
sound
of
it
filled
them
with
terror
what
shall
we
do
said
athos
we
must
seize
the
felucca
said
aramis
and
kill
him
said
porthos
the
felucca
is
mined
said
d
artagnan
those
casks
which
i
took
for
casks
of
port
wine
are
filled
with
powder
when
mordaunt
finds
himself
discovered
he
will
destroy
all
friends
and
foes
and
on
my
word
he
would
be
bad
company
in
going
either
to
heaven
or
to
you
have
some
plan
then
asked
athos
what
is
it
have
you
confidence
in
me
give
your
orders
said
the
three
musketeers
very
well
come
this
d
artagnan
went
toward
a
very
small
low
window
just
large
enough
to
let
a
man
through
he
turned
it
gently
on
its
hinges
there
he
said
is
our
the
deuce
it
is
a
very
cold
one
my
dear
friend
said
aramis
stay
here
if
you
like
but
i
warn
you
twill
be
rather
too
warm
but
we
can
not
swim
to
the
the
longboat
is
yonder
lashed
to
the
felucca
we
will
take
possession
of
it
and
cut
the
cable
come
my
a
moment
s
delay
said
athos
our
servants
here
we
are
they
cried
meantime
the
three
friends
were
standing
motionless
before
the
awful
sight
which
d
artagnan
in
raising
the
shutters
had
disclosed
to
them
through
the
narrow
opening
of
the
window
those
who
have
once
beheld
such
a
spectacle
know
that
there
is
nothing
more
solemn
more
striking
than
the
raging
sea
rolling
with
its
deafening
roar
its
dark
billows
beneath
the
pale
light
of
a
wintry
moon
gracious
heaven
we
are
hesitating
cried
d
artagnan
if
we
hesitate
what
will
the
servants
do
i
do
not
hesitate
you
know
said
grimaud
sir
interposed
blaisois
i
warn
you
that
i
can
only
swim
in
and
i
not
at
all
said
mousqueton
but
d
artagnan
had
now
slipped
through
the
window
you
have
decided
friend
said
athos
yes
the
gascon
answered
athos
you
who
are
a
perfect
being
bid
spirit
triumph
over
body
do
you
aramis
order
the
servants
porthos
kill
every
one
who
stands
in
your
and
after
pressing
the
hand
of
athos
d
artagnan
chose
a
moment
when
the
ship
rolled
backward
so
that
he
had
only
to
plunge
into
the
water
which
was
already
up
to
his
waist
athos
followed
him
before
the
felucca
rose
again
on
the
waves
the
cable
which
tied
the
boat
to
the
vessel
was
then
seen
plainly
rising
out
of
the
sea
d
artagnan
swam
to
it
and
held
it
suspending
himself
by
this
rope
his
head
alone
out
of
water
in
one
second
athos
joined
him
then
they
saw
as
the
felucca
turned
two
other
heads
peeping
those
of
aramis
and
grimaud
i
am
uneasy
about
blaisois
said
athos
he
can
he
says
only
swim
in
when
people
can
swim
at
all
they
can
swim
anywhere
to
the
boat
to
the
boat
but
porthos
i
do
not
see
porthos
is
coming
he
swims
like
in
fact
porthos
did
not
appear
for
a
scene
half
tragedy
and
half
comedy
had
been
performed
by
him
with
mousqueton
and
blaisois
who
frightened
by
the
noise
of
the
sea
by
the
whistling
of
the
wind
by
the
sight
of
that
dark
water
yawning
like
a
gulf
beneath
them
shrank
back
instead
of
going
forward
come
come
said
porthos
jump
but
monsieur
said
mousqueton
i
can
t
swim
let
me
stay
and
me
too
monsieur
said
blaisois
i
assure
you
i
shall
be
very
much
in
the
way
in
that
little
boat
said
mousqueton
and
i
know
i
shall
drown
before
reaching
it
continued
blaisois
come
along
i
shall
strangle
you
both
if
you
don
t
get
out
said
porthos
at
last
seizing
mousqueton
by
the
throat
forward
blaisois
a
groan
stifled
by
the
grasp
of
porthos
was
all
the
reply
of
poor
blaisois
for
the
giant
taking
him
neck
and
heels
plunged
him
into
the
water
headforemost
pushing
him
out
of
the
window
as
if
he
had
been
a
plank
now
mousqueton
he
said
i
hope
you
don
t
mean
to
desert
your
master
ah
sir
replied
mousqueton
his
eyes
filling
with
tears
why
did
you
the
army
we
were
all
so
happy
in
the
chateau
de
pierrefonds
and
without
any
other
complaint
passive
and
obedient
either
from
true
devotion
to
his
master
or
from
the
example
set
by
blaisois
mousqueton
leaped
into
the
sea
headforemost
a
sublime
action
at
all
events
for
mousqueton
looked
upon
himself
as
dead
but
porthos
was
not
a
man
to
abandon
an
old
servant
and
when
mousqueton
rose
above
the
water
blind
as
a
puppy
he
found
he
was
supported
by
the
large
hand
of
porthos
and
that
he
was
thus
enabled
without
having
occasion
even
to
move
to
advance
toward
the
cable
with
the
dignity
of
a
very
triton
in
a
few
minutes
porthos
had
rejoined
his
companions
who
were
already
in
the
boat
but
when
after
they
had
all
got
in
it
came
to
his
turn
there
was
great
danger
that
in
putting
his
huge
leg
over
the
edge
of
the
boat
he
would
upset
the
little
vessel
athos
was
the
last
to
enter
are
you
all
here
he
asked
ah
have
you
your
sword
athos
cried
d
artagnan
cut
the
cable
athos
drew
a
sharp
poniard
from
his
belt
and
cut
the
cord
the
felucca
went
on
the
boat
continued
stationary
rocked
only
by
the
swashing
waves
come
athos
said
d
artagnan
giving
his
hand
to
the
count
you
are
going
to
see
something
curious
added
the
gascon
fatality
scarcely
had
d
artagnan
uttered
these
words
when
a
ringing
and
sudden
noise
was
heard
resounding
through
the
felucca
which
had
now
become
dim
in
the
obscurity
of
the
night
that
you
may
be
sure
said
the
gascon
means
they
then
at
the
same
instant
perceived
a
large
lantern
carried
on
a
pole
appear
on
the
deck
defining
the
forms
of
shadows
behind
it
suddenly
a
terrible
cry
a
cry
of
despair
was
wafted
through
space
and
as
if
the
shrieks
of
anguish
had
driven
away
the
clouds
the
veil
which
hid
the
moon
was
cleated
away
and
the
gray
sails
and
dark
shrouds
of
the
felucca
were
plainly
visible
beneath
the
silvery
light
shadows
ran
as
if
bewildered
to
and
fro
on
the
vessel
and
mournful
cries
accompanied
these
delirious
walkers
in
the
midst
of
these
screams
they
saw
mordaunt
upon
the
poop
with
a
torch
in
hand
the
agitated
figures
apparently
wild
with
terror
consisted
of
groslow
who
at
the
hour
fixed
by
mordaunt
had
collected
his
men
and
the
sailors
mordaunt
after
having
listened
at
the
door
of
the
cabin
to
hear
if
the
musketeers
were
still
asleep
had
gone
down
into
the
cellar
convinced
by
their
silence
that
they
were
all
in
a
deep
slumber
then
he
had
run
to
the
train
impetuous
as
a
man
who
is
excited
by
revenge
and
full
of
confidence
as
are
those
whom
god
blinds
he
had
set
fire
to
the
wick
of
nitre
all
this
while
groslow
and
his
men
were
assembled
on
deck
haul
up
the
cable
and
draw
the
boat
to
us
said
groslow
one
of
the
sailors
got
down
the
side
of
the
ship
seized
the
cable
and
drew
it
it
came
without
the
least
resistance
the
cable
is
cut
he
cried
no
boat
how
no
boat
exclaimed
groslow
it
is
tis
true
however
answered
the
sailor
there
s
nothing
in
the
wake
of
the
ship
besides
here
s
the
end
of
the
what
s
the
matter
cried
mordaunt
who
coming
up
out
of
the
hatchway
rushed
to
the
stern
waving
his
torch
only
that
our
enemies
have
escaped
they
have
cut
the
cord
and
gone
off
with
the
mordaunt
bounded
with
one
step
to
the
cabin
and
kicked
open
the
door
empty
he
exclaimed
the
infernal
demons
we
must
pursue
them
said
groslow
they
can
t
be
gone
far
and
we
will
sink
them
passing
over
yes
but
the
fire
ejaculated
mordaunt
i
have
lighted
ten
thousand
devils
cried
groslow
rushing
to
the
hatchway
perhaps
there
is
still
time
to
save
mordaunt
answered
only
by
a
terrible
laugh
threw
his
torch
into
the
sea
and
plunged
in
after
it
the
instant
groslow
put
his
foot
upon
the
hatchway
steps
the
ship
opened
like
the
crater
of
a
volcano
a
burst
of
flame
rose
toward
the
skies
with
an
explosion
like
that
of
a
hundred
cannon
the
air
burned
ignited
by
flaming
embers
then
the
frightful
lightning
disappeared
the
brands
sank
one
after
another
into
the
abyss
where
they
were
extinguished
and
save
for
a
slight
vibration
in
the
air
after
a
few
minutes
had
elapsed
one
would
have
thought
that
nothing
had
happened
only
the
felucca
had
disappeared
from
the
surface
of
the
sea
and
groslow
and
his
three
sailors
were
consumed
the
four
friends
saw
all
this
not
a
single
detail
of
this
fearful
scene
escaped
them
at
one
moment
bathed
as
they
were
in
a
flood
of
brilliant
light
which
illumined
the
sea
for
the
space
of
a
league
they
might
each
be
seen
each
by
his
own
peculiar
attitude
and
manner
expressing
the
awe
which
even
in
their
hearts
of
bronze
they
could
not
help
experiencing
soon
a
torrent
of
vivid
sparks
fell
around
them
then
at
last
the
volcano
was
extinguished
then
all
was
dark
and
still
the
floating
bark
and
heaving
ocean
they
sat
silent
and
dejected
by
heaven
at
last
said
athos
the
first
to
speak
by
this
time
i
think
all
must
be
here
my
lords
save
me
help
cried
a
voice
whose
mournful
accents
reaching
the
four
friends
seemed
to
proceed
from
some
phantom
of
the
ocean
all
looked
around
athos
himself
stared
tis
he
it
is
his
voice
all
still
remained
silent
the
eyes
of
all
were
turned
in
the
direction
where
the
vessel
had
disappeared
endeavoring
in
vain
to
penetrate
the
darkness
after
a
minute
or
two
they
were
able
to
distinguish
a
man
who
approached
them
swimming
vigorously
athos
extended
his
arm
toward
him
pointing
him
out
to
his
companions
yes
yes
i
see
him
well
enough
said
d
artagnan
he
again
cried
porthos
who
was
breathing
like
a
blacksmith
s
bellows
why
he
is
made
of
oh
my
god
muttered
athos
aramis
and
d
artagnan
whispered
to
each
other
mordaunt
made
several
strokes
more
and
raising
his
arm
in
sign
of
distress
above
the
waves
pity
pity
on
me
gentlemen
in
heaven
s
name
my
strength
is
failing
me
i
am
the
voice
that
implored
aid
was
so
piteous
that
it
awakened
pity
in
the
heart
of
athos
poor
fellow
he
exclaimed
indeed
said
d
artagnan
monsters
have
only
to
complain
to
gain
your
sympathy
i
believe
he
s
swimming
toward
us
does
he
think
we
are
going
to
take
him
in
row
porthos
and
setting
the
example
he
plowed
his
oar
into
the
sea
two
strokes
took
the
bark
on
twenty
fathoms
further
oh
you
will
not
abandon
me
you
will
not
leave
me
to
perish
you
will
not
be
pitiless
cried
mordaunt
ah
ah
said
porthos
to
mordaunt
i
think
we
have
you
now
my
hero
and
there
are
no
doors
by
which
you
can
escape
this
time
but
those
of
oh
porthos
murmured
the
comte
de
la
fere
oh
pray
for
mercy
s
sake
don
t
fly
from
me
for
pity
s
sake
cried
the
young
man
whose
breath
at
times
when
his
head
went
under
water
under
the
wave
exhaled
and
made
the
icy
waters
bubble
d
artagnan
however
who
had
consulted
with
aramis
spoke
to
the
poor
wretch
go
away
he
said
your
repentance
is
too
recent
to
inspire
confidence
see
the
vessel
in
which
you
wished
to
fry
us
is
still
smoking
and
the
situation
in
which
you
are
is
a
bed
of
roses
compared
to
that
in
which
you
wished
to
place
us
and
in
which
you
have
placed
monsieur
groslow
and
his
sir
replied
mordaunt
in
a
tone
of
deep
despair
my
penitence
is
sincere
gentlemen
i
am
young
scarcely
years
old
i
was
drawn
on
by
a
very
natural
resentment
to
avenge
my
mother
you
would
have
done
what
i
mordaunt
wanted
now
only
two
or
three
fathoms
to
reach
the
boat
for
the
approach
of
death
seemed
to
give
him
supernatural
strength
alas
he
said
i
am
then
to
die
you
are
going
to
kill
the
son
as
you
killed
the
mother
surely
if
i
am
culpable
and
if
i
ask
for
pardon
i
ought
to
be
then
as
if
his
strength
failed
him
he
seemed
unable
to
sustain
himself
above
the
water
and
a
wave
passed
over
his
head
which
drowned
his
voice
oh
this
is
torture
to
me
cried
athos
mordaunt
reappeared
for
my
part
said
d
artagnan
i
say
this
must
come
to
an
end
murderer
as
you
were
of
your
uncle
executioner
as
you
were
of
king
charles
incendiary
i
recommend
you
to
sink
forthwith
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
if
you
come
another
fathom
nearer
i
ll
stave
your
wicked
head
in
with
this
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
cried
athos
my
son
i
entreat
you
the
wretch
is
dying
and
it
is
horrible
to
let
a
man
die
without
extending
a
hand
to
save
him
i
can
not
resist
doing
so
he
must
zounds
replied
d
artagnan
why
don
t
you
give
yourself
up
directly
feet
and
hands
bound
to
that
wretch
ah
comte
de
la
fere
you
wish
to
perish
by
his
hands
i
your
son
as
you
call
me
i
will
not
let
you
twas
the
first
time
d
artagnan
had
ever
refused
a
request
from
athos
aramis
calmly
drew
his
sword
which
he
had
carried
between
his
teeth
as
he
swam
if
he
lays
his
hand
on
the
boat
s
edge
i
will
cut
it
off
regicide
that
he
and
i
said
porthos
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
aramis
throw
myself
in
the
water
and
strangle
oh
gentlemen
cried
athos
be
men
be
christians
see
death
is
depicted
on
his
face
ah
do
not
bring
on
me
the
horrors
of
remorse
grant
me
this
poor
wretch
s
life
i
will
bless
you
i
i
am
dying
cried
mordaunt
come
to
me
come
to
me
d
artagnan
began
to
be
touched
the
boat
at
this
moment
turned
around
and
the
dying
man
was
by
that
turn
brought
nearer
athos
monsieur
the
comte
de
la
fere
he
cried
i
supplicate
you
pity
me
i
call
on
you
where
are
you
i
see
you
no
longer
i
am
dying
help
me
help
me
here
i
am
sir
said
athos
leaning
and
stretching
out
his
arm
to
mordaunt
with
that
air
of
dignity
and
nobility
of
soul
habitual
to
him
here
i
am
take
my
hand
and
jump
into
our
mordaunt
made
a
last
effort
rose
seized
the
hand
thus
extended
to
him
and
grasped
it
with
the
vehemence
of
despair
that
s
right
said
athos
put
your
other
hand
and
he
offered
him
his
shoulder
as
another
stay
and
support
so
that
his
head
almost
touched
that
of
mordaunt
and
these
two
mortal
enemies
were
in
as
close
an
embrace
as
if
they
had
been
brothers
now
sir
said
the
count
you
are
safe
calm
ah
my
mother
cried
mordaunt
with
eyes
on
fire
with
a
look
of
hate
impossible
to
paint
i
can
only
offer
thee
one
victim
but
it
shall
at
any
rate
be
the
one
thou
wouldst
thyself
have
chosen
and
whilst
d
artagnan
uttered
a
cry
porthos
raised
the
oar
and
aramis
sought
a
place
to
strike
a
frightful
shake
given
to
the
boat
precipitated
athos
into
the
sea
whilst
mordaunt
with
a
shout
of
triumph
grasped
the
neck
of
his
victim
and
in
order
to
paralyze
his
movements
twined
arms
and
legs
around
the
musketeer
for
an
instant
without
an
exclamation
without
a
cry
for
help
athos
tried
to
sustain
himself
on
the
surface
of
the
waters
but
the
weight
dragged
him
down
he
disappeared
by
degrees
soon
nothing
was
to
be
seen
except
his
long
floating
hair
then
both
men
disappeared
and
the
bubbling
of
the
water
which
in
its
turn
was
soon
effaced
alone
indicated
the
spot
where
these
two
had
sunk
mute
with
horror
the
three
friends
had
remained
their
eyes
dilated
their
arms
extended
like
statues
and
motionless
as
they
were
the
beating
of
their
hearts
was
audible
porthos
was
the
first
who
came
to
himself
he
tore
his
hair
oh
he
cried
athos
athos
thou
man
of
noble
heart
woe
is
me
i
have
let
thee
perish
at
this
instant
in
the
midst
of
the
silver
circle
illumined
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
same
whirlpool
which
had
been
made
by
the
sinking
men
was
again
obvious
and
first
were
seen
rising
above
the
waves
a
wisp
of
hair
then
a
pale
face
with
open
eyes
yet
nevertheless
the
eyes
of
death
then
a
body
which
after
rising
of
itself
even
to
the
waist
above
the
sea
turned
gently
on
its
back
according
to
the
caprice
of
the
waves
and
floated
in
the
bosom
of
this
corpse
was
plunged
a
poniard
the
gold
hilt
of
which
shone
in
the
moonbeams
mordaunt
mordaunt
cried
the
three
friends
tis
mordaunt
but
athos
exclaimed
d
artagnan
suddenly
the
boat
leaned
on
one
side
beneath
a
new
and
unexpected
weight
and
grimaud
uttered
a
shout
of
joy
every
one
turned
around
and
beheld
athos
livid
his
eyes
dim
and
his
hands
trembling
supporting
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
boat
eight
vigorous
arms
lifted
him
up
immediately
and
laid
him
in
the
boat
where
directly
athos
was
warmed
and
reanimated
reviving
with
the
caresses
and
cares
of
his
friends
who
were
intoxicated
with
joy
you
are
not
hurt
asked
d
artagnan
no
replied
athos
and
he
oh
he
now
we
may
say
at
last
thank
heaven
he
is
really
dead
look
and
d
artagnan
obliging
athos
to
look
in
the
direction
he
pointed
showed
him
the
body
of
mordaunt
floating
on
its
back
which
sometimes
submerged
sometimes
rising
seemed
still
to
pursue
the
four
friends
with
looks
of
insult
and
mortal
hatred
at
last
he
sank
athos
had
followed
him
with
a
glance
in
which
the
deepest
melancholy
and
pity
were
expressed
bravo
athos
cried
aramis
with
an
emotion
very
rare
in
him
a
capital
blow
you
gave
cried
porthos
i
have
a
son
i
wished
to
live
said
athos
in
short
said
d
artagnan
this
has
been
the
will
of
it
was
not
i
who
killed
him
said
athos
in
a
soft
low
tone
twas
how
mousqueton
had
a
narrow
escape
of
being
eaten
a
deep
silence
reigned
for
a
long
time
in
the
boat
after
the
fearful
scene
described
the
moon
which
had
shone
for
a
short
time
disappeared
behind
the
clouds
every
object
was
again
plunged
in
the
obscurity
that
is
so
awful
in
the
deserts
and
still
more
so
in
that
liquid
desert
the
ocean
and
nothing
was
heard
save
the
whistling
of
the
west
wind
driving
along
the
tops
of
the
crested
billows
porthos
was
the
first
to
speak
i
have
seen
he
said
many
dreadful
things
but
nothing
that
ever
agitated
me
so
much
as
what
i
have
just
witnessed
nevertheless
even
in
my
present
state
of
perturbation
i
protest
that
i
feel
happy
i
have
a
hundred
pounds
weight
less
upon
my
chest
i
breathe
more
in
fact
porthos
breathed
so
loud
as
to
do
credit
to
the
free
play
of
his
powerful
lungs
for
my
part
observed
aramis
i
can
not
say
the
same
as
you
do
porthos
i
am
still
terrified
to
such
a
degree
that
i
scarcely
believe
my
eyes
i
look
around
the
boat
expecting
every
moment
to
see
that
poor
wretch
holding
between
his
hands
the
poniard
plunged
into
his
oh
i
feel
easy
replied
porthos
the
poniard
was
pointed
at
the
sixth
rib
and
buried
up
to
the
hilt
in
his
body
i
do
not
reproach
you
athos
for
what
you
have
done
on
the
contrary
when
one
aims
a
blow
that
is
the
regulation
way
to
strike
so
now
i
breathe
again
i
am
happy
don
t
be
in
haste
to
celebrate
a
victory
porthos
interposed
d
artagnan
never
have
we
incurred
a
greater
danger
than
we
are
now
encountering
men
may
subdue
men
they
can
not
overcome
the
elements
we
are
now
on
the
sea
at
night
without
any
pilot
in
a
frail
bark
should
a
blast
of
wind
upset
the
boat
we
are
mousqueton
heaved
a
deep
sigh
you
are
ungrateful
d
artagnan
said
athos
yes
ungrateful
to
providence
to
whom
we
owe
our
safety
in
the
most
miraculous
manner
let
us
sail
before
the
wind
and
unless
it
changes
we
shall
be
drifted
either
to
calais
or
boulogne
should
our
bark
be
upset
we
are
five
of
us
good
swimmers
able
enough
to
turn
it
over
again
or
if
not
to
hold
on
by
it
now
we
are
on
the
very
road
which
all
the
vessels
between
dover
and
calais
take
tis
impossible
but
that
we
should
meet
with
a
fisherman
who
will
pick
us
but
should
we
not
find
any
fisherman
and
should
the
wind
shift
to
the
north
that
said
athos
would
be
quite
another
thing
and
we
should
nevermore
see
land
until
we
were
upon
the
other
side
of
the
which
implies
that
we
may
die
of
hunger
said
aramis
tis
more
than
possible
answered
the
comte
de
la
fere
mousqueton
sighed
again
more
deeply
than
before
what
is
the
matter
what
ails
you
asked
porthos
i
am
cold
sir
said
mousqueton
impossible
your
body
is
covered
with
a
coating
of
fat
which
preserves
it
from
the
cold
ah
sir
tis
this
very
coating
of
fat
that
makes
me
how
is
that
mousqueton
alas
your
honor
in
the
library
of
the
chateau
of
bracieux
there
are
a
lot
of
books
of
what
then
amongst
them
the
voyages
of
jean
mocquet
in
the
time
of
henry
well
in
these
books
your
honor
tis
told
how
hungry
voyagers
drifting
out
to
sea
have
a
bad
habit
of
eating
each
other
and
beginning
with
the
fattest
among
them
cried
d
artagnan
unable
in
spite
of
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
to
help
laughing
yes
sir
answered
mousqueton
but
permit
me
to
say
i
see
nothing
laughable
in
it
however
he
added
turning
to
porthos
i
should
not
regret
dying
sir
were
i
sure
that
by
doing
so
i
might
still
be
useful
to
mouston
replied
porthos
much
affected
should
we
ever
see
my
castle
of
pierrefonds
again
you
shall
have
as
your
own
and
for
your
descendants
the
vineyard
that
surrounds
the
and
you
should
call
it
devotion
added
aramis
the
vineyard
of
to
transmit
to
latest
ages
the
recollection
of
your
devotion
to
your
chevalier
said
d
artagnan
laughing
you
could
eat
a
piece
of
mouston
couldn
t
you
especially
after
two
or
three
days
of
fasting
oh
no
replied
aramis
i
should
much
prefer
blaisois
we
haven
t
known
him
so
one
may
readily
conceive
that
during
these
jokes
which
were
intended
chiefly
to
divert
athos
from
the
scene
which
had
just
taken
place
the
servants
with
the
exception
of
grimaud
were
not
silent
suddenly
mousqueton
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
taking
from
beneath
one
of
the
benches
a
bottle
of
wine
and
on
looking
more
closely
in
the
same
place
he
discovered
a
dozen
similar
bottles
bread
and
a
monster
junk
of
salted
beef
oh
sir
he
cried
passing
the
bottle
to
porthos
we
are
saved
the
bark
is
supplied
with
this
intelligence
restored
every
one
save
athos
to
gayety
zounds
exclaimed
porthos
tis
astonishing
how
empty
violent
agitation
makes
the
and
he
drank
off
half
a
bottle
at
a
draught
and
bit
great
mouthfuls
of
the
bread
and
meat
now
said
athos
sleep
or
try
to
sleep
my
friends
and
i
will
in
a
few
moments
notwithstanding
their
wet
clothes
the
icy
blast
that
blew
and
the
previous
scene
of
terror
these
hardy
adventurers
with
their
iron
frames
inured
to
every
hardship
threw
themselves
down
intending
to
profit
by
the
advice
of
athos
who
sat
at
the
helm
pensively
wakeful
guiding
the
little
bark
the
way
it
was
to
go
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
heavens
as
if
he
sought
to
verify
not
only
the
road
to
france
but
the
benign
aspect
of
protecting
providence
after
some
hours
of
repose
the
sleepers
were
aroused
by
athos
dawn
was
shedding
its
pallid
placid
glimmer
on
the
purple
ocean
when
at
the
distance
of
a
musket
shot
from
them
was
seen
a
dark
gray
mass
above
which
gleamed
a
triangular
sail
then
masters
and
servants
joined
in
a
fervent
cry
to
the
crew
of
that
vessel
to
hear
them
and
to
save
a
bark
all
cried
together
it
was
in
fact
a
small
craft
from
dunkirk
bound
for
boulogne
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterward
the
rowboat
of
this
craft
took
them
all
aboard
grimaud
tendered
twenty
guineas
to
the
captain
and
at
nine
o
clock
in
the
morning
having
a
fair
wind
our
frenchmen
set
foot
on
their
native
land
egad
how
strong
one
feels
here
said
porthos
almost
burying
his
large
feet
in
the
sands
zounds
i
could
defy
a
nation
be
quiet
porthos
said
d
artagnan
we
are
we
are
admired
i
faith
answered
porthos
these
people
who
are
looking
at
us
are
only
merchants
said
athos
and
are
looking
more
at
the
cargo
than
at
i
shall
not
trust
to
that
said
the
lieutenant
and
i
shall
make
for
the
as
soon
as
sandy
hills
about
dunkirk
from
which
it
derives
its
the
party
followed
him
and
soon
disappeared
with
him
behind
the
hillocks
of
sand
unobserved
here
after
a
short
conference
they
proposed
to
separate
and
why
separate
asked
athos
because
answered
the
gascon
we
were
sent
porthos
and
i
by
cardinal
mazarin
to
fight
for
cromwell
instead
of
fighting
for
cromwell
we
have
served
charles
not
the
same
thing
by
any
means
in
returning
with
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
monsieur
d
herblay
our
crime
would
be
confirmed
we
have
circumvented
cromwell
mordaunt
and
the
sea
but
we
shall
find
a
certain
difficulty
in
circumventing
you
forget
replied
athos
that
we
consider
ourselves
your
prisoners
and
not
free
from
the
engagement
we
entered
truly
athos
interrupted
d
artagnan
i
am
vexed
that
such
a
man
as
you
are
should
talk
nonsense
which
schoolboys
would
be
ashamed
of
chevalier
he
continued
addressing
aramis
who
leaning
proudly
on
his
sword
seemed
to
agree
with
his
companion
chevalier
porthos
and
i
run
no
risk
besides
should
any
happen
to
two
of
us
will
it
not
be
much
better
that
the
other
two
should
be
spared
to
assist
those
who
may
be
apprehended
besides
who
knows
whether
divided
we
may
not
obtain
a
pardon
you
from
the
queen
we
from
mazarin
which
were
we
all
four
together
would
never
be
granted
come
athos
and
aramis
go
to
the
right
porthos
come
with
me
to
the
left
these
gentlemen
should
file
off
into
normandy
whilst
we
by
the
nearest
road
reach
he
then
gave
his
friends
minute
directions
as
to
their
route
ah
my
dear
friend
exclaimed
athos
how
i
should
admire
the
resources
of
your
mind
did
i
not
stop
to
adore
those
of
your
and
he
gave
him
his
hand
isn
t
this
fox
a
genius
athos
asked
the
gascon
no
he
knows
how
to
crunch
fowls
to
dodge
the
huntsman
and
to
find
his
way
home
by
day
or
by
night
that
s
all
well
is
all
said
then
let
s
count
our
money
and
divide
it
ah
hurrah
there
s
the
sun
a
merry
morning
to
you
sunshine
tis
a
long
time
since
i
saw
thee
come
come
d
artagnan
said
athos
do
not
affect
to
be
there
are
tears
in
your
eyes
let
us
be
open
with
each
other
and
what
cried
the
gascon
do
you
think
athos
we
can
take
leave
calmly
of
two
friends
at
a
time
not
free
from
danger
to
you
and
aramis
no
answered
athos
embrace
me
my
zounds
said
porthos
sobbing
i
believe
i
m
crying
but
how
foolish
all
this
is
then
they
embraced
at
that
moment
their
fraternal
bond
of
union
was
closer
than
ever
and
when
they
parted
each
to
take
the
route
agreed
on
they
turned
back
to
utter
affectionate
expressions
which
the
echoes
of
the
dunes
repeated
at
last
they
lost
sight
of
each
other
sacrebleu
d
artagnan
said
porthos
i
must
out
with
it
at
once
for
i
can
t
keep
to
myself
anything
i
have
against
you
i
haven
t
been
able
to
recognize
you
in
this
why
not
said
d
artagnan
with
his
wise
smile
because
if
as
you
say
athos
and
aramis
are
in
real
danger
this
is
not
the
time
to
abandon
them
for
my
part
i
confess
to
you
that
i
was
all
ready
to
follow
them
and
am
still
ready
to
rejoin
them
in
spite
of
all
the
mazarins
in
the
you
would
be
right
porthos
but
for
one
thing
which
may
change
the
current
of
your
ideas
and
that
is
that
it
is
not
those
gentlemen
who
are
in
the
greatest
danger
it
is
ourselves
it
is
not
to
abandon
them
that
we
have
separated
but
to
avoid
compromising
really
said
porthos
opening
his
eyes
in
astonishment
yes
no
doubt
if
they
are
arrested
they
will
only
be
put
in
the
bastile
if
we
are
arrested
it
is
a
matter
of
the
place
de
oh
oh
said
porthos
there
is
quite
a
gap
between
that
fate
and
the
baronial
coronet
you
promised
me
d
bah
perhaps
not
so
great
as
you
think
porthos
you
know
the
proverb
all
roads
lead
to
but
how
is
it
that
we
are
incurring
greater
risks
than
athos
and
aramis
asked
porthos
because
they
have
but
fulfilled
the
mission
confided
to
them
by
queen
henrietta
and
we
have
betrayed
that
confided
to
us
by
mazarin
because
going
hence
as
emissaries
to
cromwell
we
became
partisans
of
king
charles
because
instead
of
helping
cut
off
the
royal
head
condemned
by
those
fellows
called
mazarin
cromwell
joyce
bridge
fairfax
we
very
nearly
succeeded
in
saving
upon
my
word
that
is
true
said
porthos
but
how
can
you
suppose
my
dear
friend
that
in
the
midst
of
his
great
preoccupations
general
cromwell
has
had
time
to
think
cromwell
thinks
of
everything
cromwell
has
time
for
everything
and
believe
me
dear
friend
we
ought
not
to
lose
our
time
it
is
precious
we
shall
not
be
safe
till
we
have
seen
mazarin
and
then
the
devil
said
porthos
what
can
we
say
to
mazarin
leave
that
to
me
i
have
my
plan
he
laughs
best
who
laughs
last
cromwell
is
mighty
mazarin
is
tricky
but
i
would
rather
have
to
do
with
them
than
with
the
late
monsieur
ah
said
porthos
it
is
very
pleasant
to
be
able
to
say
the
late
monsieur
my
faith
yes
said
d
artagnan
but
we
must
be
the
two
immediately
started
across
country
toward
the
road
to
paris
followed
by
mousqueton
who
after
being
too
cold
all
night
at
the
end
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
found
himself
too
warm
the
return
during
the
six
weeks
that
athos
and
aramis
had
been
absent
from
france
the
parisians
finding
themselves
one
morning
without
either
queen
or
king
were
greatly
annoyed
at
being
thus
deserted
and
the
absence
of
mazarin
a
thing
so
long
desired
did
not
compensate
for
that
of
the
two
august
fugitives
the
first
feeling
that
pervaded
paris
on
hearing
of
the
flight
to
saint
germain
was
that
sort
of
affright
which
seizes
children
when
they
awake
in
the
night
and
find
themselves
alone
a
deputation
was
therefore
sent
to
the
queen
to
entreat
her
to
return
to
paris
but
she
not
only
declined
to
receive
the
deputies
but
sent
an
intimation
by
chancellor
seguier
implying
that
if
the
parliament
did
not
humble
itself
before
her
majesty
by
negativing
all
the
questions
that
had
been
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
paris
would
be
besieged
the
very
next
day
this
threatening
answer
unluckily
for
the
court
produced
quite
a
different
effect
to
that
which
was
intended
it
wounded
the
pride
of
the
parliament
which
supported
by
the
citizens
replied
by
declaring
that
cardinal
mazarin
was
the
cause
of
all
the
discontent
denounced
him
as
the
enemy
both
of
the
king
and
the
state
and
ordered
him
to
retire
from
the
court
that
same
day
and
from
france
within
a
week
afterward
enjoining
in
case
of
disobedience
on
his
part
all
the
subjects
of
the
king
to
pursue
and
take
him
mazarin
being
thus
placed
beyond
the
pale
of
the
protection
of
the
law
preparations
on
both
sides
were
commenced
by
the
queen
to
attack
paris
by
the
citizens
to
defend
it
the
latter
were
occupied
in
breaking
up
the
pavement
and
stretching
chains
across
the
streets
when
headed
by
the
coadjutor
appeared
the
prince
de
conti
the
brother
of
the
prince
de
conde
and
the
duc
de
longueville
his
this
unexpected
band
of
auxiliaries
arrived
in
paris
on
the
tenth
of
january
and
the
prince
of
conti
was
named
but
not
until
after
a
stormy
discussion
generalissimo
of
the
army
of
the
king
out
of
paris
as
for
the
duc
de
beaufort
he
arrived
from
vendome
according
to
the
annals
of
the
day
bringing
with
him
his
high
bearing
and
his
long
and
beautiful
hair
qualifications
which
gained
him
the
sovereignty
of
the
marketplaces
the
parisian
army
had
organized
with
the
promptness
characteristic
of
the
bourgeois
whenever
they
are
moved
by
any
sentiment
whatever
to
disguise
themselves
as
soldiers
on
the
nineteenth
the
impromptu
army
had
attempted
a
sortie
more
to
assure
itself
and
others
of
its
actual
existence
than
with
any
more
serious
intention
they
carried
a
banner
on
which
could
be
read
this
strange
device
we
are
seeking
our
the
next
following
days
were
occupied
in
trivial
movements
which
resulted
only
in
the
carrying
off
of
a
few
herds
of
cattle
and
the
burning
of
two
or
three
houses
that
was
still
the
situation
of
affairs
up
to
the
early
days
of
february
on
the
first
day
of
that
month
our
four
companions
had
landed
at
boulogne
and
in
two
parties
had
set
out
for
paris
toward
the
end
of
the
fourth
day
of
the
journey
athos
and
aramis
reached
nanterre
which
place
they
cautiously
passed
by
on
the
outskirts
fearing
that
they
might
encounter
some
troop
from
the
queen
s
army
it
was
against
his
will
that
athos
took
these
precautions
but
aramis
had
very
judiciously
reminded
him
that
they
had
no
right
to
be
imprudent
that
they
had
been
charged
by
king
charles
with
a
supreme
and
sacred
mission
which
received
at
the
foot
of
the
scaffold
could
be
accomplished
only
at
the
feet
of
queen
henrietta
upon
that
athos
yielded
on
reaching
the
capital
athos
and
aramis
found
it
in
arms
the
sentinel
at
the
gate
refused
even
to
let
them
pass
and
called
his
sergeant
the
sergeant
with
the
air
of
importance
which
such
people
assume
when
they
are
clad
with
military
dignity
said
who
are
you
gentlemen
two
and
where
do
you
come
from
from
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
in
paris
we
are
going
with
a
mission
to
her
majesty
the
queen
of
ah
every
one
seems
to
be
going
to
see
the
queen
of
england
we
have
already
at
the
station
three
gentlemen
whose
passports
are
under
examination
who
are
on
their
way
to
her
majesty
where
are
your
passports
we
have
none
we
left
england
ignorant
of
the
state
of
politics
here
having
left
paris
before
the
departure
of
the
ah
said
the
sergeant
with
a
cunning
smile
you
are
mazarinists
who
are
sent
as
my
dear
friend
here
athos
spoke
rest
assured
if
we
were
mazarinists
we
should
come
well
prepared
with
every
sort
of
passport
in
your
situation
distrust
those
who
are
well
provided
with
every
enter
the
guardroom
said
the
sergeant
we
will
lay
your
case
before
the
commandant
of
the
the
guardroom
was
filled
with
citizens
and
common
people
some
playing
some
drinking
some
talking
in
a
corner
almost
hidden
from
view
were
three
gentlemen
who
had
preceded
athos
and
aramis
and
an
officer
was
examining
their
passports
the
first
impulse
of
these
three
and
of
those
who
last
entered
was
to
cast
an
inquiring
glance
at
each
other
the
first
arrivals
wore
long
cloaks
in
whose
drapery
they
were
carefully
enveloped
one
of
them
shorter
than
the
rest
remained
pertinaciously
in
the
background
when
the
sergeant
on
entering
the
room
announced
that
in
all
probability
he
was
bringing
in
two
mazarinists
it
appeared
to
be
the
unanimous
opinion
of
the
officers
on
guard
that
they
ought
not
to
pass
be
it
so
said
athos
yet
it
is
probable
on
the
contrary
that
we
shall
enter
because
we
seem
to
have
to
do
with
sensible
people
there
seems
to
be
only
one
thing
to
do
which
is
to
send
our
names
to
her
majesty
the
queen
of
england
and
if
she
engages
to
answer
for
us
i
presume
we
shall
be
allowed
to
on
hearing
these
words
the
shortest
of
the
other
three
men
seemed
more
attentive
than
ever
to
what
was
going
on
wrapping
his
cloak
around
him
more
carefully
than
before
merciful
goodness
whispered
aramis
to
athos
did
you
see
what
asked
athos
the
face
of
the
shortest
of
those
three
gentlemen
he
looked
to
me
but
tis
at
this
instant
the
sergeant
who
had
been
for
his
orders
returned
and
pointing
to
the
three
gentlemen
in
cloaks
said
the
passports
are
in
order
let
these
three
gentlemen
the
three
gentlemen
bowed
and
hastened
to
take
advantage
of
this
permission
aramis
looked
after
them
and
as
the
last
of
them
passed
close
to
him
he
pressed
the
hand
of
athos
what
is
the
matter
with
you
my
friend
asked
the
latter
i
have
doubtless
i
am
dreaming
tell
me
sir
he
said
to
the
sergeant
do
you
know
those
three
gentlemen
who
are
just
gone
out
only
by
their
passports
they
are
three
frondists
who
are
gone
to
rejoin
the
duc
de
tis
strange
said
aramis
almost
involuntarily
i
fancied
that
i
recognized
mazarin
the
sergeant
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
he
he
cried
he
venture
himself
amongst
us
to
be
hung
not
so
foolish
as
all
ah
muttered
athos
i
may
be
mistaken
i
haven
t
the
unerring
eye
of
d
who
is
speaking
of
monsieur
d
artagnan
asked
an
officer
who
appeared
at
that
moment
upon
the
threshold
of
the
room
what
cried
aramis
and
athos
what
planchet
planchet
added
grimaud
planchet
with
a
gorget
indeed
ah
gentlemen
cried
planchet
so
you
are
back
again
in
paris
oh
how
happy
you
make
us
no
doubt
you
come
to
join
the
princes
as
thou
seest
planchet
said
aramis
whilst
athos
smiled
on
seeing
what
important
rank
was
held
in
the
city
militia
by
the
former
comrade
of
mousqueton
bazin
and
grimaud
and
monsieur
d
artagnan
of
whom
you
spoke
just
now
monsieur
d
herblay
may
i
ask
if
you
have
any
news
of
him
we
parted
from
him
four
days
ago
and
we
have
reason
to
believe
that
he
has
reached
paris
before
no
sir
i
am
sure
he
hasn
t
yet
arrived
but
then
he
may
have
stopped
at
saint
i
don
t
think
so
we
appointed
to
meet
at
la
i
was
there
this
very
and
had
the
pretty
madeleine
no
news
asked
aramis
smiling
no
sir
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
she
seemed
very
in
fact
said
aramis
there
is
no
time
lost
and
we
made
our
journey
quickly
permit
me
then
my
dear
athos
without
inquiring
further
about
our
friend
to
pay
my
respects
to
ah
monsieur
le
chevalier
said
planchet
bowing
lieutenant
asked
aramis
lieutenant
with
a
promise
of
becoming
tis
capital
and
pray
how
did
you
acquire
all
these
honors
in
the
first
place
gentlemen
you
know
that
i
was
the
means
of
monsieur
de
rochefort
s
escape
well
i
was
very
near
being
hung
by
mazarin
and
that
made
me
more
popular
than

owing
to
your
popularity
no
thanks
to
something
better
you
know
gentlemen
that
i
served
the
piedmont
regiment
and
had
the
honor
of
being
a
sergeant
well
one
day
when
no
one
could
drill
a
mob
of
citizens
who
began
to
march
some
with
the
right
foot
others
with
the
left
i
succeeded
i
did
in
making
them
all
begin
with
the
same
foot
and
i
was
made
lieutenant
on
the
so
i
presume
said
athos
that
you
have
a
large
number
of
the
nobles
with
you
certainly
there
are
the
prince
de
conti
the
duc
de
longueville
the
duc
de
beaufort
the
duc
de
bouillon
the
marechal
de
la
mothe

marquis
de
sevigne
and
i
don
t
know
who
for
my
and
the
vicomte
raoul
de
bragelonne
inquired
athos
in
a
tremulous
voice
d
artagnan
told
me
that
he
had
recommended
him
to
your
care
in
yes
count
nor
have
i
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
single
instant
then
said
athos
in
a
tone
of
delight
he
is
well
no
accident
has
happened
to
him
none
and
he
lives
still
at
the
hotel
of
the
great
and
passes
his
time
sometimes
with
the
queen
of
england
sometimes
with
madame
de
chevreuse
he
and
the
count
de
guiche
are
like
each
other
s
thanks
planchet
thanks
cried
athos
extending
his
hand
to
the
lieutenant
oh
sir
planchet
only
touched
the
tips
of
the
count
s
fingers
well
what
are
you
doing
count
to
a
former
lackey
my
friend
said
athos
he
has
given
me
news
of
and
now
gentlemen
said
planchet
who
had
not
heard
what
they
were
saying
what
do
you
intend
to
do
paris
if
you
will
let
us
my
good
let
you
sir
now
as
ever
i
am
nothing
but
your
then
turning
to
his
men
allow
these
gentlemen
to
pass
he
said
they
are
friends
of
the
duc
de
long
live
the
duc
de
beaufort
cried
the
sentinels
the
sergeant
drew
near
to
planchet
what
without
passports
he
murmured
without
passports
said
planchet
take
notice
captain
he
continued
giving
planchet
his
expected
title
take
notice
that
one
of
the
three
men
who
just
now
went
out
from
here
told
me
privately
to
distrust
these
and
i
said
planchet
with
dignity
i
know
them
and
i
answer
for
as
he
said
this
he
pressed
grimaud
s
hand
who
seemed
honored
by
the
distinction
farewell
till
we
meet
again
said
aramis
as
they
took
leave
of
planchet
if
anything
happens
to
us
we
shall
blame
you
for
sir
said
planchet
i
am
in
all
things
at
your
that
fellow
is
no
fool
said
aramis
as
he
got
on
his
horse
how
should
he
be
replied
athos
whilst
mounting
also
seeing
he
was
used
so
long
to
brush
your
the
ambassadors
the
two
friends
rode
rapidly
down
the
declivity
of
the
faubourg
but
on
arriving
at
the
bottom
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
streets
of
paris
had
become
rivers
and
the
open
places
lakes
after
the
great
rains
which
fell
in
january
the
seine
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
the
river
inundated
half
the
capital
the
two
gentlemen
were
obliged
therefore
to
get
off
their
horses
and
take
a
boat
and
in
that
strange
manner
they
approached
the
louvre
night
had
closed
in
and
paris
seen
thus
by
the
light
of
lanterns
flickering
on
the
pools
of
water
crowded
with
of
every
kind
including
those
that
glittered
with
the
armed
patrols
with
the
watchword
passing
from
post
to
post
paris
presented
such
an
aspect
as
to
strongly
seize
the
senses
of
aramis
a
man
most
susceptible
to
warlike
impressions
they
reached
the
queen
s
apartments
but
were
compelled
to
stop
in
the
since
her
majesty
was
at
that
moment
giving
audience
to
gentlemen
bringing
her
news
from
england
we
too
said
athos
to
the
footman
who
had
given
him
that
answer
not
only
bring
news
from
england
but
have
just
come
from
what
then
are
your
names
gentlemen
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
chevalier
d
herblay
said
aramis
ah
in
that
case
gentlemen
said
the
footman
on
hearing
the
names
which
the
queen
had
so
often
pronounced
with
hope
in
that
case
it
is
another
thing
and
i
think
her
majesty
will
pardon
me
for
not
keeping
you
here
a
moment
please
follow
me
and
he
went
on
before
followed
by
athos
and
aramis
on
arriving
at
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
queen
was
receiving
he
made
a
sign
for
them
to
wait
and
opening
the
door
madame
he
said
i
hope
your
majesty
will
forgive
me
for
disobeying
your
orders
when
you
learn
that
the
gentlemen
i
have
come
to
announce
are
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
chevalier
d
on
hearing
those
two
names
the
queen
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
which
the
two
gentlemen
heard
poor
queen
murmured
athos
oh
let
them
come
in
let
them
come
in
cried
the
young
princess
bounding
to
the
door
the
poor
child
was
constant
in
her
attendance
on
her
mother
and
sought
by
her
filial
attentions
to
make
her
forget
the
absence
of
her
two
sons
and
her
other
daughter
come
in
gentlemen
repeated
the
princess
opening
the
door
herself
the
queen
was
seated
on
a
fauteuil
and
before
her
were
standing
two
or
three
gentlemen
and
among
them
the
duc
de
chatillon
the
brother
of
the
nobleman
killed
eight
or
nine
years
previously
in
a
duel
on
account
of
madame
de
longueville
on
the
place
royale
all
these
gentlemen
had
been
noticed
by
athos
and
aramis
in
the
guardhouse
and
when
the
two
friends
were
announced
they
started
and
exchanged
some
words
in
a
low
tone
well
sirs
cried
the
queen
on
perceiving
the
two
friends
you
have
come
faithful
friends
but
the
royal
couriers
have
been
more
expeditious
than
you
and
here
are
monsieur
de
flamarens
and
monsieur
de
chatillon
who
bring
me
from
her
majesty
the
queen
anne
of
austria
the
very
latest
aramis
and
athos
were
astounded
by
the
calmness
even
the
gayety
of
the
queen
s
manner
go
on
with
your
recital
sirs
said
the
queen
turning
to
the
duc
de
chatillon
you
said
that
his
majesty
king
charles
my
august
consort
had
been
condemned
to
death
by
a
majority
of
his
subjects
yes
madame
chatillon
stammered
out
athos
and
aramis
were
more
and
more
astonished
and
that
being
conducted
to
the
scaffold
resumed
the
queen
oh
my
lord
oh
my
king
and
that
being
led
to
the
scaffold
he
had
been
saved
by
an
indignant
just
so
madame
replied
chatillon
in
so
low
a
voice
that
though
the
two
friends
were
listening
eagerly
they
could
hardly
hear
this
affirmation
the
queen
clasped
her
hands
in
enthusiastic
gratitude
whilst
her
daughter
threw
her
arms
around
her
mother
s
neck
and
kissed
her
her
own
eyes
streaming
with
tears
now
madame
nothing
remains
to
me
except
to
proffer
my
respectful
homage
said
chatillon
who
felt
confused
and
ashamed
beneath
the
stern
gaze
of
athos
one
moment
yes
answered
the
queen
one
moment
i
beg
for
here
are
the
chevalier
d
herblay
and
the
comte
de
la
fere
just
arrived
from
london
and
they
can
give
you
as
such
details
as
you
can
convey
to
the
queen
my
royal
sister
speak
gentlemen
speak
i
am
listening
conceal
nothing
gloss
over
nothing
since
his
majesty
still
lives
since
the
honor
of
the
throne
is
safe
everything
else
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
athos
turned
pale
and
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
well
exclaimed
the
queen
who
remarked
this
movement
and
his
paleness
speak
sir
i
beg
you
to
do
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
madame
i
wish
to
add
nothing
to
the
recital
of
these
gentlemen
until
they
perceive
themselves
that
they
have
perhaps
been
mistaken
cried
the
queen
almost
suffocated
by
emotion
mistaken
what
has
happened
then
sir
interposed
monsieur
de
flamarens
to
athos
if
we
are
mistaken
the
error
has
originated
with
the
queen
i
do
not
suppose
you
will
have
the
presumption
to
set
it
to
rights
that
would
be
to
accuse
her
majesty
queen
anne
of
with
the
queen
sir
replied
athos
in
his
calm
vibrating
voice
yes
murmured
flamarens
lowering
his
eyes
athos
sighed
deeply
or
rather
sir
said
aramis
with
his
peculiar
irritating
politeness
the
error
of
the
person
who
was
with
you
when
we
met
you
in
the
guardroom
for
if
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
i
are
not
mistaken
we
saw
you
in
the
company
of
a
third
chatillon
and
flamarens
started
explain
yourself
count
cried
the
queen
whose
anxiety
grew
greater
every
moment
on
your
brow
i
read
despair
your
lips
falter
ere
you
announce
some
terrible
tidings
your
hands
tremble
oh
my
god
my
god
what
has
happened
lord
ejaculated
the
young
princess
falling
on
her
knees
have
mercy
on
us
sir
said
chatillon
if
you
bring
bad
tidings
it
will
be
cruel
in
you
to
announce
them
to
the
aramis
went
so
close
to
chatillon
as
almost
to
touch
him
sir
said
he
with
compressed
lips
and
flashing
eyes
you
have
not
the
presumption
to
instruct
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
myself
what
we
ought
to
say
here
during
this
brief
altercation
athos
with
his
hands
on
his
heart
his
head
bent
low
approached
the
queen
and
in
a
voice
of
deepest
sorrow
said
madame
princes
who
by
nature
are
above
other
men
receive
from
heaven
courage
to
support
greater
misfortunes
than
those
of
lower
rank
for
their
hearts
are
elevated
as
their
fortunes
we
ought
not
therefore
i
think
to
act
toward
a
queen
so
illustrious
as
your
majesty
as
we
should
act
toward
a
woman
of
our
lowlier
condition
queen
destined
as
you
are
to
endure
every
sorrow
on
this
earth
hear
the
result
of
our
unhappy
athos
kneeling
down
before
the
queen
trembling
and
very
cold
drew
from
his
bosom
inclosed
in
the
same
case
the
order
set
in
diamonds
which
the
queen
had
given
to
lord
de
winter
and
the
wedding
ring
which
charles
before
his
death
had
placed
in
the
hands
of
aramis
since
the
moment
he
had
first
received
these
two
mementoes
athos
had
never
parted
with
them
he
opened
the
case
and
offered
them
to
the
queen
with
deep
and
silent
anguish
the
queen
stretched
out
her
hand
seized
the
ring
pressed
it
convulsively
to
her
lips
and
without
being
able
to
breathe
a
sigh
to
give
vent
to
a
sob
she
extended
her
arms
became
deadly
pale
and
fell
senseless
in
the
arms
of
her
attendants
and
her
daughter
athos
kissed
the
hem
of
the
robe
of
the
widowed
queen
and
rising
with
a
dignity
that
made
a
deep
impression
on
those
around
i
the
comte
de
la
fere
a
gentleman
who
has
never
deceived
any
human
being
swear
before
god
and
before
this
unhappy
queen
that
all
that
was
possible
to
save
the
king
of
england
was
done
whilst
we
were
on
english
ground
now
chevalier
he
added
turning
to
aramis
let
us
go
our
duty
is
not
said
aramis
we
have
still
a
word
to
say
to
these
and
turning
to
chatillon
sir
be
so
good
as
not
to
go
away
without
giving
me
an
opportunity
to
tell
you
something
i
can
not
say
before
the
chatillon
bowed
in
token
of
assent
and
they
all
went
out
stopping
at
the
window
of
a
gallery
on
the
ground
floor
sir
said
aramis
you
allowed
yourself
just
now
to
treat
us
in
a
most
extraordinary
manner
that
would
not
be
endurable
in
any
case
and
is
still
less
so
on
the
part
of
those
who
came
to
bring
the
queen
the
message
of
a
sir
cried
de
chatillon
what
have
you
done
with
monsieur
de
bruy
has
he
by
any
possibility
gone
to
change
his
face
which
was
too
like
that
of
monsieur
de
mazarin
there
is
an
abundance
of
italian
masks
at
the
palais
royal
from
harlequin
even
to
chevalier
chevalier
said
athos
leave
me
alone
said
aramis
impatiently
you
know
well
that
i
don
t
like
to
leave
things
half
conclude
then
sir
answered
de
chatillon
with
as
much
hauteur
as
aramis
gentlemen
resumed
aramis
any
one
but
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
myself
would
have
had
you
arrested
for
we
have
friends
in
paris
but
we
are
contented
with
another
course
come
and
converse
with
us
for
just
five
minutes
sword
in
hand
upon
this
deserted
one
moment
gentlemen
cried
flamarens
i
know
well
that
the
proposition
is
tempting
but
at
present
it
is
impossible
to
accept
and
why
not
said
aramis
in
his
tone
of
raillery
is
it
mazarin
s
proximity
that
makes
you
so
prudent
oh
you
hear
that
flamarens
said
chatillon
not
to
reply
would
be
a
blot
on
my
name
and
my
that
is
my
opinion
said
aramis
you
will
not
reply
however
and
these
gentlemen
i
am
sure
will
presently
be
of
my
aramis
shook
his
head
with
a
motion
of
indescribable
insolence
chatillon
saw
the
motion
and
put
his
hand
to
his
sword
willingly
replied
de
chatillon
duke
said
flamarens
you
forget
that
you
are
to
command
an
expedition
of
the
greatest
importance
projected
by
the
prince
assented
to
by
the
queen
until
evening
you
are
not
at
your
own
let
it
be
then
the
day
after
said
aramis
rather
said
de
chatillon
if
you
will
take
the
trouble
of
coming
so
far
as
the
gates
of
how
can
you
doubt
it
sir
for
the
pleasure
of
a
meeting
with
you
i
would
go
to
the
end
of
the
very
well
i
shall
rely
on
it
are
you
going
to
rejoin
your
cardinal
swear
first
on
your
honor
not
to
inform
him
of
our
conditions
why
not
because
it
is
for
victors
to
make
conditions
and
you
are
not
yet
victors
then
let
us
draw
on
the
spot
it
is
all
one
to
us
to
us
who
do
not
command
s
chatillon
and
flamarens
looked
at
each
other
there
was
such
irony
in
the
words
and
in
the
bearing
of
aramis
that
the
duke
had
great
difficulty
in
bridling
his
anger
but
at
a
word
from
flamarens
he
restrained
himself
and
contented
himself
with
saying
you
promise
sir
that
s
agreed
that
i
shall
find
you
at
charenton
oh
don
t
be
afraid
sir
replied
aramis
and
the
two
gentlemen
shortly
afterward
left
the
louvre
for
what
reason
is
all
this
fume
and
fury
asked
athos
what
have
they
done
to
you
they
did
you
not
see
what
they
did
they
laughed
when
we
swore
that
we
had
done
our
duty
in
england
now
if
they
believed
us
they
laughed
in
order
to
insult
us
if
they
did
not
believe
it
they
insulted
us
all
the
more
however
i
m
glad
not
to
fight
them
until
i
hope
we
shall
have
something
better
to
do
than
to
draw
the
what
have
we
to
do
egad
to
take
athos
curled
his
lip
with
disdain
these
undertakings
do
not
suit
me
as
you
know
why
because
it
is
taking
people
really
athos
you
would
make
a
singular
general
you
would
fight
only
by
broad
daylight
warn
your
foe
before
an
attack
and
never
attempt
anything
by
night
lest
you
should
be
accused
of
taking
advantage
of
the
athos
smiled
you
know
one
can
not
change
his
nature
he
said
besides
do
you
know
what
is
our
situation
and
whether
mazarin
s
arrest
wouldn
t
be
rather
an
encumbrance
than
an
advantage
say
at
once
you
disapprove
of
my
i
think
you
ought
to
do
nothing
since
you
exacted
a
promise
from
these
gentlemen
not
to
let
mazarin
know
that
we
were
in
i
have
entered
into
no
engagement
and
consider
myself
quite
free
come
where
either
to
seek
the
duc
de
beaufort
or
the
duc
de
bouillon
and
to
tell
them
about
yes
but
on
one
condition
that
we
begin
by
the
coadjutor
he
is
a
priest
learned
in
cases
of
conscience
and
we
will
tell
him
it
was
then
agreed
that
they
were
to
go
first
to
monsieur
de
bouillon
as
his
house
came
first
but
first
of
all
athos
begged
that
he
might
go
to
the
hotel
du
grand
charlemagne
to
see
raoul
they
the
boat
which
had
brought
them
to
the
louvre
and
thence
proceeded
to
the
halles
and
taking
up
grimaud
and
blaisois
they
went
on
foot
to
the
rue
guenegaud
but
raoul
was
not
at
the
hotel
du
grand
charlemagne
he
had
received
a
message
from
the
prince
to
whom
he
had
hastened
with
olivain
the
instant
he
had
received
it
the
three
lieutenants
of
the
generalissimo
the
night
was
dark
but
still
the
town
resounded
with
those
noises
that
disclose
a
city
in
a
state
of
siege
athos
and
aramis
did
not
proceed
a
hundred
steps
without
being
stopped
by
sentinels
placed
before
the
barricades
who
demanded
the
watchword
and
on
their
saying
that
they
were
going
to
monsieur
de
bouillon
on
a
mission
of
importance
a
guide
was
given
them
under
pretext
of
conducting
them
but
in
fact
as
a
spy
over
their
movements
on
arriving
at
the
hotel
de
bouillon
they
came
across
a
little
troop
of
three
cavaliers
who
seemed
to
know
every
possible
password
for
they
walked
without
either
guide
or
escort
and
on
arriving
at
the
barricades
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
speak
to
those
who
guarded
them
who
instantly
let
them
pass
with
evident
deference
due
probably
to
their
high
birth
on
seeing
them
athos
and
aramis
stood
still
oh
cried
aramis
do
you
see
count
yes
said
athos
who
do
these
three
cavaliers
appear
to
you
to
be
what
do
you
think
aramis
why
they
are
our
you
are
not
mistaken
i
recognize
monsieur
de
and
i
monsieur
de
as
to
the
cavalier
in
the
brown
cloak
it
is
the
in
how
the
devil
do
they
venture
so
near
the
hotel
de
bouillon
athos
smiled
but
did
not
reply
five
minutes
afterward
they
knocked
at
the
prince
s
door
this
door
was
guarded
by
a
sentinel
and
there
was
also
a
guard
placed
in
the
courtyard
ready
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
prince
de
conti
s
lieutenant
monsieur
de
bouillon
had
the
gout
but
notwithstanding
his
illness
which
had
prevented
his
mounting
on
horseback
for
the
last
month
is
since
paris
had
been
besieged
he
was
ready
to
receive
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
the
chevalier
d
herblay
he
was
in
bed
but
surrounded
with
all
the
paraphernalia
of
war
everywhere
were
swords
pistols
cuirasses
and
arquebuses
and
it
was
plain
that
as
soon
as
his
gout
was
better
monsieur
de
bouillon
would
give
a
pretty
tangle
to
the
enemies
of
the
parliament
to
unravel
meanwhile
to
his
great
regret
as
he
said
he
was
obliged
to
keep
his
bed
ah
gentlemen
he
cried
as
the
two
friends
entered
you
are
very
happy
you
can
ride
you
can
go
and
come
and
fight
for
the
cause
of
the
people
but
i
as
you
see
am
nailed
to
my
bed
ah
this
demon
gout
this
demon
gout
my
lord
said
athos
we
are
just
arrived
from
england
and
our
first
concern
is
to
inquire
after
your
thanks
gentlemen
thanks
as
you
see
my
health
is
but
indifferent
but
you
come
from
england
and
king
charles
is
well
as
i
have
just
heard
he
is
dead
my
lord
said
aramis
pooh
said
the
duke
too
much
astonished
to
believe
it
true
dead
on
the
scaffold
condemned
by
impossible
and
executed
in
our
what
then
has
monsieur
de
flamarens
been
telling
me
monsieur
de
flamarens
yes
he
has
just
gone
athos
smiled
with
two
companions
he
said
with
two
companions
yes
replied
the
duke
then
he
added
with
a
certain
uneasiness
did
you
meet
them
why
yes
i
think
so
in
the
street
said
athos
and
he
looked
smilingly
at
aramis
who
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
surprise
the
devil
take
this
gout
cried
monsieur
de
bouillon
evidently
ill
at
ease
my
lord
said
athos
we
admire
your
devotion
to
the
cause
you
have
espoused
in
remaining
at
the
head
of
the
army
whilst
so
ill
in
so
much
one
must
replied
monsieur
de
bouillon
sacrifice
one
s
comfort
to
the
public
good
but
i
confess
to
you
i
am
now
almost
exhausted
my
spirit
is
willing
my
head
is
clear
but
this
demon
the
gout
o
ercrows
me
i
confess
if
the
court
would
do
justice
to
my
claims
and
give
the
head
of
my
house
the
title
of
prince
and
if
my
brother
de
turenne
were
reinstated
in
his
command
i
would
return
to
my
estates
and
leave
the
court
and
parliament
to
settle
things
between
themselves
as
they
you
are
perfectly
right
my
you
think
so
at
this
very
moment
the
court
is
making
overtures
to
me
hitherto
i
have
repulsed
them
but
since
such
men
as
you
assure
me
that
i
am
wrong
in
doing
so
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
follow
your
advice
and
to
accept
a
proposition
made
to
me
by
the
duc
de
chatillon
just
accept
it
my
lord
accept
it
said
aramis
faith
yes
i
am
even
sorry
that
this
evening
i
almost
repulsed
but
there
will
be
a
conference
and
we
shall
the
two
friends
saluted
the
duke
go
gentlemen
he
said
you
must
be
much
fatigued
after
your
voyage
poor
king
charles
but
after
all
he
was
somewhat
to
blame
in
all
that
business
and
we
may
console
ourselves
with
the
reflection
that
france
has
no
cause
of
reproach
in
the
matter
and
did
all
she
could
to
serve
oh
as
to
that
said
aramis
we
are
witnesses
mazarin
especially
yes
do
you
know
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
you
give
that
testimony
the
cardinal
has
some
good
in
him
and
if
he
were
not
a
foreigner
well
he
would
be
more
justly
estimated
oh
the
devil
take
this
gout
athos
and
aramis
took
their
leave
but
even
in
the
they
could
still
hear
the
duke
s
cries
he
was
evidently
suffering
the
tortures
of
the
damned
when
they
reached
the
street
aramis
said
well
athos
what
do
you
think
of
whom
pardieu
of
monsieur
de
my
friend
i
think
that
he
is
much
troubled
with
you
noticed
that
i
didn
t
breathe
a
word
as
to
the
purpose
of
our
visit
you
did
well
you
would
have
caused
him
an
access
of
his
disease
let
us
go
to
monsieur
de
the
two
friends
went
to
the
hotel
de
vendome
it
was
ten
o
clock
when
they
arrived
the
hotel
de
vendome
was
not
less
guarded
than
the
hotel
de
bouillon
and
presented
as
warlike
an
appearance
there
were
sentinels
a
guard
in
the
court
stacks
of
arms
and
horses
saddled
two
horsemen
going
out
as
athos
and
aramis
entered
were
obliged
to
give
place
to
them
ah
ah
gentlemen
said
aramis
decidedly
it
is
a
night
for
meetings
we
shall
be
very
unfortunate
if
after
meeting
so
often
this
evening
we
should
not
succeed
in
meeting
oh
as
to
that
sir
replied
chatillon
for
it
was
he
who
with
flamarens
was
leaving
the
duc
de
beaufort
you
may
be
assured
for
if
we
meet
by
night
without
seeking
each
other
much
more
shall
we
meet
by
day
when
wishing
i
hope
that
is
true
said
aramis
as
for
me
i
am
sure
of
it
said
the
duke
de
flamarens
and
de
chatillon
continued
on
their
way
and
athos
and
aramis
dismounted
hardly
had
they
given
the
bridles
of
their
horses
to
their
lackeys
and
rid
themselves
of
their
cloaks
when
a
man
approached
them
and
after
looking
at
them
for
an
instant
by
the
doubtful
light
of
the
lantern
hung
in
the
centre
of
the
courtyard
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
ran
to
embrace
them
comte
de
la
fere
the
man
cried
out
chevalier
d
herblay
how
does
it
happen
that
you
are
in
paris
rochefort
cried
the
two
friends
yes
we
arrived
four
or
five
days
ago
from
the
vendomois
as
you
know
and
we
are
going
to
give
mazarin
something
to
do
you
are
still
with
us
i
presume
more
than
ever
and
the
duke
furious
against
the
cardinal
you
know
his
success
our
dear
duke
he
is
really
king
of
paris
he
can
t
go
out
without
being
mobbed
by
his
ah
so
much
the
better
can
we
have
the
honor
of
seeing
his
highness
i
shall
be
proud
to
present
you
and
rochefort
walked
on
every
door
was
opened
to
him
monsieur
de
beaufort
was
at
supper
but
he
rose
quickly
on
hearing
the
two
friends
announced
ah
he
cried
by
jove
you
re
welcome
sirs
you
are
coming
to
sup
with
me
are
you
not
boisgoli
tell
noirmont
that
i
have
two
guests
you
know
noirmont
do
you
not
the
successor
of
father
marteau
who
makes
the
excellent
pies
you
know
of
boisgoli
let
him
send
one
of
his
best
but
not
such
a
one
as
he
made
for
la
ramee
thank
god
we
don
t
want
either
rope
ladders
or
my
lord
said
athos
do
not
let
us
disturb
you
we
came
merely
to
inquire
after
your
health
and
to
take
your
as
to
my
health
since
it
has
stood
five
years
of
prison
with
monsieur
de
chavigny
to
boot
tis
excellent
as
to
my
orders
since
every
one
gives
his
own
commands
in
our
party
i
shall
end
if
this
goes
on
by
giving
none
at
in
short
my
lord
said
athos
glancing
at
aramis
your
highness
is
discontented
with
your
party
discontented
sir
say
my
highness
is
furious
to
such
a
degree
i
assure
you
though
i
would
not
say
so
to
others
that
if
the
queen
acknowledging
the
injuries
she
has
done
me
would
recall
my
mother
and
give
me
the
reversion
of
the
admiralty
which
belonged
to
my
father
and
was
promised
me
at
his
death
well
it
would
not
be
long
before
i
should
be
training
dogs
to
say
that
there
were
greater
traitors
in
france
than
the
cardinal
mazarin
at
this
athos
and
aramis
could
not
help
exchanging
not
only
a
look
but
a
smile
and
had
they
not
known
it
for
a
fact
this
would
have
told
them
that
de
chatillon
and
de
flamarens
had
been
there
my
lord
said
athos
we
are
satisfied
we
came
here
only
to
express
our
loyalty
and
to
say
that
we
are
at
your
lordship
s
service
and
his
most
faithful
my
most
faithful
friends
gentlemen
my
most
faithful
friends
you
have
proved
it
and
if
ever
i
am
reconciled
with
the
court
i
shall
prove
to
you
i
hope
that
i
remain
your
friend
as
well
as
that
of
what
the
devil
are
their
names
d
artagnan
and
porthos
d
artagnan
and
ah
yes
you
understand
then
comte
de
la
fere
you
understand
chevalier
d
herblay
that
i
am
altogether
and
always
at
your
athos
and
aramis
bowed
and
went
out
my
dear
athos
cried
aramis
i
think
you
consented
to
accompany
me
only
to
give
me
a
lesson
god
forgive
me
wait
a
little
aramis
it
will
be
time
for
you
to
perceive
my
motive
when
we
have
paid
our
visit
to
the
let
us
then
go
to
the
archiepiscopal
palace
said
aramis
they
directed
their
horses
to
the
city
on
arriving
at
the
cradle
from
which
paris
sprang
they
found
it
inundated
with
water
and
it
was
again
necessary
to
take
a
boat
the
palace
rose
from
the
bosom
of
the
water
and
to
see
the
number
of
boats
around
it
one
would
have
fancied
one
s
self
not
in
paris
but
in
venice
some
of
these
boats
were
dark
and
mysterious
others
noisy
and
lighted
up
with
torches
the
friends
slid
in
through
this
congestion
of
embarkation
and
landed
in
their
turn
the
palace
was
surrounded
with
water
but
a
kind
of
staircase
had
been
fixed
to
the
lower
walls
and
the
only
difference
was
that
instead
of
entering
by
the
doors
people
entered
by
the
windows
thus
did
athos
and
aramis
make
their
appearance
in
the
where
about
a
dozen
noblemen
were
collected
in
waiting
good
heavens
said
aramis
to
athos
does
the
coadjutor
intend
to
indulge
himself
in
the
pleasure
of
making
us
cool
our
hearts
off
in
his
my
dear
friend
we
must
take
people
as
we
find
them
the
coadjutor
is
at
this
moment
one
of
the
seven
kings
of
paris
and
has
a
court
let
us
send
in
our
names
and
if
he
does
not
send
us
a
suitable
message
we
will
leave
him
to
his
own
affairs
or
those
of
france
let
us
call
one
of
these
lackeys
with
a
in
the
left
exactly
so
cried
aramis
ah
if
i
m
not
mistaken
here
s
bazin
come
here
bazin
who
was
crossing
the
majestically
in
his
clerical
dress
turned
around
to
see
who
the
impertinent
gentleman
was
who
thus
addressed
him
but
seeing
his
friends
he
went
up
to
them
quickly
and
expressed
delight
at
seeing
them
a
truce
to
compliments
said
aramis
we
want
to
see
the
coadjutor
and
instantly
as
we
are
in
certainly
sir
it
is
not
such
lords
as
you
are
who
are
allowed
to
wait
in
the
only
just
now
he
has
a
secret
conference
with
monsieur
de
de
bruy
cried
the
friends
tis
then
useless
our
seeing
monsieur
the
coadjutor
this
evening
said
aramis
so
we
give
it
and
they
hastened
to
quit
the
palace
followed
by
bazin
who
was
lavish
of
bows
and
compliments
well
said
athos
when
aramis
and
he
were
in
the
boat
again
are
you
beginning
to
be
convinced
that
we
should
have
done
a
bad
turn
to
all
these
people
in
arresting
mazarin
you
are
wisdom
incarnate
athos
aramis
replied
what
had
especially
been
observed
by
the
two
friends
was
the
little
interest
taken
by
the
court
of
france
in
the
terrible
events
which
had
occurred
in
england
which
they
thought
should
have
arrested
the
attention
of
all
europe
in
fact
aside
from
a
poor
widow
and
a
royal
orphan
who
wept
in
the
corner
of
the
louvre
no
one
appeared
to
be
aware
that
charles
had
ever
lived
and
that
he
had
perished
on
the
scaffold
the
two
friends
made
an
appointment
for
ten
o
clock
on
the
following
day
for
though
the
night
was
well
advanced
when
they
reached
the
door
of
the
hotel
aramis
said
that
he
had
certain
important
visits
to
make
and
left
athos
to
enter
alone
at
ten
o
clock
the
next
day
they
met
again
athos
had
been
out
since
six
o
clock
well
have
you
any
news
athos
asked
nothing
no
one
has
seen
d
artagnan
and
porthos
has
not
appeared
have
you
anything
the
devil
said
aramis
in
fact
said
athos
this
delay
is
not
natural
they
took
the
shortest
route
and
should
have
arrived
before
we
add
to
that
d
artagnan
s
rapidity
in
action
and
that
he
is
not
the
man
to
lose
an
hour
knowing
that
we
were
expecting
he
expected
you
will
remember
to
be
here
on
the
and
here
we
are
at
the
ninth
this
evening
the
margin
of
possible
delay
what
do
you
think
should
be
done
asked
athos
if
we
have
no
news
of
them
pardieu
we
must
go
and
look
for
all
right
said
athos
but
raoul
said
aramis
a
light
cloud
passed
over
the
count
s
face
raoul
gives
me
much
uneasiness
he
said
he
received
yesterday
a
message
from
the
prince
de
conde
he
went
to
meet
him
at
saint
cloud
and
has
not
have
you
seen
madame
de
chevreuse
she
was
not
at
home
and
you
aramis
you
were
going
i
think
to
visit
madame
de
i
did
go
well
she
was
no
longer
there
but
she
had
left
her
new
where
was
she
guess
i
give
you
a
thousand
how
should
i
know
where
the
most
beautiful
and
active
of
the
frondists
was
at
midnight
for
i
presume
it
was
when
you
left
me
that
you
went
to
visit
at
the
hotel
de
ville
my
dear
what
at
the
hotel
de
ville
has
she
then
been
appointed
provost
of
merchants
no
but
she
has
become
queen
of
paris
ad
interim
and
since
she
could
not
venture
at
once
to
establish
herself
in
the
palais
royal
or
the
tuileries
she
is
installed
at
the
hotel
de
ville
where
she
is
on
the
point
of
giving
an
heir
or
an
heiress
to
that
dear
you
didn
t
tell
me
of
that
really
it
was
my
forgetfulness
then
pardon
now
asked
athos
what
are
we
to
do
with
ourselves
till
evening
here
we
are
without
occupation
it
seems
to
you
forget
my
friend
that
we
have
work
cut
out
for
us
in
the
direction
of
charenton
i
hope
to
see
monsieur
de
chatillon
whom
i
ve
hated
for
a
long
time
why
have
you
hated
him
because
he
is
the
brother
of
ah
true
he
who
presumed
to
be
a
rival
of
yours
for
which
he
was
severely
punished
that
ought
to
satisfy
yes
but
it
does
not
i
am
rancorous
the
only
stigma
that
proves
me
to
be
a
churchman
do
you
understand
you
understand
that
you
are
in
no
way
obliged
to
go
with
come
now
said
athos
you
are
in
that
case
my
dear
friend
if
you
are
resolved
to
accompany
me
there
is
no
time
to
lose
the
drum
beats
i
observed
cannon
on
the
road
i
saw
the
citizens
in
order
of
battle
on
the
place
of
the
hotel
de
ville
certainly
the
fight
will
be
in
the
direction
of
charenton
as
the
duc
de
chatillon
i
supposed
said
athos
that
last
night
s
conferences
would
modify
those
warlike
no
doubt
but
they
will
fight
none
the
less
if
only
to
mask
the
poor
creatures
said
athos
who
are
going
to
be
killed
in
order
that
monsieur
de
bouillon
may
have
his
estate
at
sedan
restored
to
him
that
the
reversion
of
the
admiralty
may
be
given
to
the
duc
de
beaufort
and
that
the
coadjutor
may
be
made
a
come
come
dear
athos
confess
that
you
would
not
be
so
philosophical
if
your
raoul
were
to
be
involved
in
this
perhaps
you
speak
the
truth
well
let
us
go
then
where
the
fighting
is
for
that
is
the
most
likely
place
to
meet
with
d
artagnan
porthos
and
possibly
even
raoul
stop
there
are
a
fine
body
of
citizens
passing
quite
attractive
by
jupiter
and
their
captain
see
he
has
the
true
military
what
ho
said
grimaud
what
asked
athos
planchet
lieutenant
yesterday
said
aramis
captain
colonel
doubtless
in
a
fortnight
the
fellow
will
be
marshal
of
question
him
about
the
fight
said
athos
planchet
prouder
than
ever
of
his
new
duties
deigned
to
explain
to
the
two
gentlemen
that
he
was
ordered
to
take
up
his
position
on
the
place
royale
with
two
hundred
men
forming
the
rear
of
the
army
of
paris
and
to
march
on
charenton
when
necessary
this
day
will
be
a
warm
one
said
planchet
in
a
warlike
tone
no
doubt
said
aramis
but
it
is
far
from
here
to
the
sir
the
distance
will
be
diminished
said
a
subordinate
aramis
saluted
then
turning
toward
athos
i
don
t
care
to
camp
on
the
place
royale
with
all
these
people
he
said
shall
we
go
forward
we
shall
see
better
what
is
going
and
then
monsieur
de
chatillon
will
not
come
to
the
place
royale
to
look
for
you
come
then
my
friend
we
will
go
haven
t
you
something
to
say
to
monsieur
de
flamarens
on
your
own
account
my
friend
said
athos
i
have
made
a
resolution
never
to
draw
my
sword
save
when
it
is
absolutely
and
how
long
ago
was
that
when
i
last
drew
my
ah
good
another
souvenir
of
monsieur
mordaunt
well
my
friend
nothing
now
is
lacking
except
that
you
should
feel
remorse
for
having
killed
that
hush
said
athos
putting
a
finger
on
his
lips
with
the
sad
smile
peculiar
to
him
let
us
talk
no
more
of
mordaunt
it
will
bring
bad
and
athos
set
forward
toward
charenton
followed
closely
by
aramis
the
battle
of
charenton
as
athos
and
aramis
proceeded
and
passed
different
companies
on
the
road
they
became
aware
that
they
were
arriving
near
the
field
of
battle
ah
my
friend
cried
athos
suddenly
where
have
you
brought
us
i
fancy
i
perceive
around
us
faces
of
different
officers
in
the
royal
army
is
not
that
the
duc
de
chatillon
himself
coming
toward
us
with
his
brigadiers
sirs
said
the
duke
advancing
you
are
puzzled
by
what
you
see
here
but
one
word
will
explain
everything
there
is
now
a
truce
and
a
conference
the
prince
monsieur
de
retz
the
duc
de
beaufort
the
duc
de
bouillon
are
talking
over
public
affairs
now
one
of
two
things
must
happen
either
matters
will
not
be
arranged
or
they
will
be
arranged
in
which
last
case
i
shall
be
relieved
of
my
command
and
we
shall
still
meet
sir
said
aramis
you
speak
to
the
point
allow
me
to
ask
you
a
question
where
are
the
plenipotentiaries
at
charenton
in
the
second
house
on
the
right
on
entering
from
the
direction
of
and
was
this
conference
arranged
beforehand
no
gentlemen
it
seems
to
be
the
result
of
certain
propositions
which
mazarin
made
last
night
to
the
athos
and
aramis
exchanged
smiles
for
they
well
knew
what
those
propositions
were
to
whom
they
had
been
made
and
who
had
made
them
and
that
house
in
which
the
plenipotentiaries
are
asked
athos
belongs
to
to
monsieur
de
chanleu
who
commands
your
troops
at
charenton
i
say
your
troops
for
i
presume
that
you
gentlemen
are
frondeurs
yes
almost
said
aramis
we
are
for
the
king
and
the
princes
added
athos
we
must
understand
each
other
said
the
duke
the
king
is
with
us
and
his
generals
are
the
duke
of
orleans
and
the
prince
de
conde
although
i
must
add
tis
almost
impossible
now
to
know
to
which
party
any
one
yes
answered
athos
but
his
right
place
is
in
our
ranks
with
the
prince
de
conti
de
beaufort
d
elbeuf
and
de
bouillon
but
sir
supposing
that
the
conference
is
broken
off
are
you
going
to
try
to
take
charenton
such
are
my
sir
since
you
command
the
cavalry
pardon
me
i
am
so
much
the
better
you
must
know
all
your
officers
i
mean
those
more
why
yes
very
will
you
then
kindly
tell
me
if
you
have
in
your
command
the
chevalier
d
artagnan
lieutenant
in
the
musketeers
no
sir
he
is
not
with
us
he
left
paris
more
than
six
weeks
ago
and
is
believed
to
have
gone
on
a
mission
to
i
knew
that
but
i
supposed
he
had
no
sir
no
one
has
seen
him
i
can
answer
positively
on
that
point
for
the
musketeers
belong
to
our
forces
and
monsieur
de
cambon
the
substitute
for
monsieur
d
artagnan
still
holds
his
the
two
friends
looked
at
each
other
you
see
said
athos
it
is
strange
said
aramis
it
is
absolutely
certain
that
some
misfortune
has
happened
to
them
on
the
if
we
have
no
news
of
them
this
evening
we
must
athos
nodded
affirmatively
then
turning
and
monsieur
de
bragelonne
a
young
man
fifteen
years
of
age
attached
to
the
prince
de
conde
has
he
the
honor
of
being
known
to
you
diffident
in
allowing
the
sarcastic
aramis
to
perceive
how
strong
were
his
paternal
feelings
yes
surely
he
came
with
the
prince
a
charming
young
man
he
is
one
of
your
friends
then
monsieur
le
comte
yes
sir
answered
athos
agitated
so
much
so
that
i
wish
to
see
him
if
quite
possible
sir
do
me
the
favor
to
accompany
me
and
i
will
conduct
you
to
halloo
there
cried
aramis
turning
around
what
a
noise
behind
us
a
body
of
cavaliers
is
coming
toward
us
said
chatillon
i
recognize
the
coadjutor
by
his
frondist
and
i
the
duc
de
beaufort
by
his
white
plume
of
ostrich
they
are
coming
full
gallop
the
prince
is
with
them
ah
he
is
leaving
them
they
are
beating
the
rappel
cried
chatillon
we
must
discover
what
is
going
in
fact
they
saw
the
soldiers
running
to
their
arms
the
trumpets
sounded
the
drums
beat
the
duc
de
beaufort
drew
his
sword
on
his
side
the
prince
sounded
a
rappel
and
all
the
officers
of
the
royalist
army
mingling
momentarily
with
the
parisian
troops
ran
to
him
gentlemen
cried
chatillon
the
truce
is
broken
that
is
evident
they
are
going
to
fight
go
then
into
charenton
for
i
shall
begin
in
a
short
time
there
s
a
signal
from
the
prince
the
cornet
of
a
troop
had
in
fact
just
raised
the
standard
of
the
prince
farewell
till
the
next
time
we
meet
cried
chatillon
and
he
set
off
full
gallop
athos
and
aramis
turned
also
and
went
to
salute
the
coadjutor
and
the
duc
de
beaufort
as
to
the
duc
de
bouillon
he
had
such
a
fit
of
gout
as
obliged
him
to
return
to
paris
in
a
litter
but
his
place
was
well
filled
by
the
duc
d
elbeuf
and
his
four
sons
ranged
around
him
like
a
staff
meantime
between
charenton
and
the
royal
army
was
left
a
space
which
looked
ready
to
serve
as
a
last
resting
place
for
the
dead
gentlemen
cried
the
coadjutor
tightening
his
sash
which
he
wore
after
the
fashion
of
the
ancient
military
prelates
over
his
archiepiscopal
simar
there
s
the
enemy
approaching
let
us
save
them
half
of
their
and
without
caring
whether
he
were
followed
or
not
he
set
off
his
regiment
which
bore
the
name
of
the
regiment
of
corinth
from
the
name
of
his
archbishopric
darted
after
him
and
began
the
fight
monsieur
de
beaufort
sent
his
cavalry
toward
etampes
and
monsieur
de
chanleu
who
defended
the
place
was
ready
to
resist
an
assault
or
if
the
enemy
were
repulsed
to
attempt
a
sortie
the
battle
soon
became
general
and
the
coadjutor
performed
miracles
of
valor
his
proper
vocation
had
always
been
the
sword
and
he
was
delighted
whenever
he
could
draw
it
from
the
scabbard
no
matter
for
whom
or
against
whom
chanleu
whose
fire
at
one
time
repulsed
the
royal
regiment
thought
that
the
moment
was
come
to
pursue
it
but
it
was
reformed
and
led
again
to
the
charge
by
the
duc
de
chatillon
in
person
this
charge
was
so
fierce
so
skillfully
conducted
that
chanleu
was
almost
surrounded
he
commanded
a
retreat
which
began
step
by
step
foot
by
foot
unhappily
in
an
instant
he
fell
mortally
wounded
de
chatillon
saw
him
fall
and
announced
it
in
a
loud
voice
to
his
men
which
raised
their
spirits
and
completely
disheartened
their
enemies
so
that
every
man
thought
only
of
his
own
safety
and
tried
to
gain
the
trenches
where
the
coadjutor
was
trying
to
reform
his
disorganized
regiment
suddenly
a
squadron
of
cavalry
galloped
up
to
encounter
the
royal
troops
who
were
entering
the
intrenchments
with
the
fugitives
athos
and
aramis
charged
at
the
head
of
their
squadrons
aramis
with
sword
and
pistol
in
his
hands
athos
with
his
sword
in
his
scabbard
his
pistol
in
his
calm
and
cool
as
if
on
the
parade
except
that
his
noble
and
beautiful
countenance
became
sad
as
he
saw
slaughtered
so
many
men
who
were
sacrificed
on
the
one
side
to
the
obstinacy
of
royalty
and
on
the
other
to
the
personal
rancor
of
the
princes
aramis
on
the
contrary
struck
right
and
left
and
was
almost
delirious
with
excitement
his
bright
eyes
kindled
and
his
mouth
so
finely
formed
assumed
a
wicked
smile
every
blow
he
aimed
was
sure
and
his
pistol
finished
the
deed
annihilated
the
wounded
wretch
who
tried
to
rise
again
on
the
opposite
side
two
cavaliers
one
covered
with
a
gilt
cuirass
the
other
wearing
simply
a
buff
doublet
from
which
fell
the
sleeves
of
a
vest
of
blue
velvet
charged
in
front
the
cavalier
in
the
gilt
cuirass
fell
upon
aramis
and
struck
a
blow
that
aramis
parried
with
his
wonted
skill
ah
tis
you
monsieur
de
chatillon
cried
the
chevalier
welcome
to
you
i
expected
i
hope
i
have
not
made
you
wait
too
long
sir
said
the
duke
at
all
events
here
i
monsieur
de
chatillon
cried
aramis
taking
from
his
a
second
pistol
i
think
if
your
pistols
have
been
discharged
you
are
a
dead
thank
god
sir
they
are
not
and
the
duke
pointing
his
pistol
at
aramis
fired
but
aramis
bent
his
head
the
instant
he
saw
the
duke
s
finger
press
the
trigger
and
the
ball
passed
without
touching
him
oh
you
ve
missed
me
cried
aramis
but
i
swear
to
heaven
i
will
not
miss
if
i
give
you
time
cried
the
duke
spurring
on
his
horse
and
rushing
upon
him
with
his
drawn
sword
aramis
awaited
him
with
that
terrible
smile
which
was
peculiar
to
him
on
such
occasions
and
athos
who
saw
the
duke
advancing
toward
aramis
with
the
rapidity
of
lightning
was
just
going
to
cry
out
fire
fire
then
when
the
shot
was
fired
de
chatillon
opened
his
arms
and
fell
back
on
the
crupper
of
his
horse
the
ball
had
entered
his
breast
through
a
notch
in
the
cuirass
i
am
a
dead
man
he
said
and
fell
from
his
horse
to
the
ground
i
told
you
this
i
am
now
grieved
i
have
kept
my
word
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
chatillon
made
a
sign
with
his
hand
and
aramis
was
about
to
dismount
when
he
received
a
violent
shock
twas
a
thrust
from
a
sword
but
his
cuirass
turned
aside
the
blow
he
turned
around
and
seized
his
new
antagonist
by
the
wrist
when
he
started
back
exclaiming
raoul
raoul
cried
athos
the
young
man
recognized
at
the
same
instant
the
voices
of
his
father
and
the
chevalier
d
herblay
two
officers
in
the
parisian
forces
rushed
at
that
instant
on
raoul
but
aramis
protected
him
with
his
sword
my
prisoner
he
cried
athos
took
his
son
s
horse
by
the
bridle
and
led
him
forth
out
of
the
melee
at
this
crisis
of
the
battle
the
prince
who
had
been
seconding
de
chatillon
in
the
second
line
appeared
in
the
midst
of
the
fight
his
eagle
eye
made
him
known
and
his
blows
proclaimed
the
hero
on
seeing
him
the
regiment
of
corinth
which
the
coadjutor
had
not
been
able
to
reorganize
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
threw
itself
into
the
midst
of
the
parisian
forces
put
them
into
confusion
and
charenton
flying
the
coadjutor
dragged
along
with
his
fugitive
forces
passed
near
the
group
formed
by
athos
raoul
and
aramis
aramis
could
not
in
his
jealousy
avoid
being
pleased
at
the
coadjutor
s
misfortune
and
was
about
to
utter
some
bon
mot
more
witty
than
correct
when
athos
stopped
him
on
on
he
cried
this
is
no
moment
for
compliments
or
rather
back
for
the
battle
seems
to
be
lost
by
the
it
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
said
aramis
i
came
here
only
to
meet
de
chatillon
i
have
met
him
i
am
contented
tis
something
to
have
met
de
chatillon
in
a
duel
and
besides
we
have
a
prisoner
said
athos
pointing
to
raoul
the
three
cavaliers
continued
their
road
on
full
gallop
what
were
you
doing
in
the
battle
my
friend
inquired
athos
of
the
youth
twas
not
your
right
place
i
think
as
you
were
not
equipped
for
an
engagement
i
had
no
intention
of
fighting
sir
i
was
charged
indeed
with
a
mission
to
the
cardinal
and
had
set
out
for
rueil
when
seeing
monsieur
de
chatillon
charge
an
invincible
desire
possessed
me
to
charge
at
his
side
it
was
then
that
he
told
me
two
cavaliers
of
the
parisian
army
were
seeking
me
and
named
the
comte
de
la
what
you
knew
we
were
there
and
yet
wished
to
kill
your
friend
the
chevalier
i
did
not
recognize
the
chevalier
in
armor
sir
said
raoul
blushing
though
i
might
have
known
him
by
his
skill
and
coolness
in
thank
you
for
the
compliment
my
young
friend
replied
aramis
we
can
see
from
whom
you
learned
courtesy
then
you
were
going
to
rueil
yes
i
have
a
despatch
from
the
prince
to
his
you
must
still
deliver
it
said
athos
no
false
generosity
count
the
fate
of
our
friends
to
say
nothing
of
our
own
is
perhaps
in
that
very
this
young
man
must
not
however
fail
in
his
duty
said
athos
in
the
first
place
count
this
youth
is
our
prisoner
you
seem
to
forget
that
what
i
propose
to
do
is
fair
in
war
the
vanquished
must
not
be
dainty
in
the
choice
of
means
give
me
the
despatch
the
young
man
hesitated
and
looked
at
athos
as
if
seeking
to
read
in
his
eyes
a
rule
of
conduct
give
him
the
despatch
raoul
you
are
the
chevalier
s
raoul
gave
it
up
reluctantly
aramis
instantly
seized
and
read
it
you
he
said
you
who
are
so
trusting
read
and
reflect
that
there
is
something
in
this
letter
important
for
us
to
athos
took
the
letter
frowning
but
an
idea
that
he
should
find
something
in
this
letter
about
d
artagnan
conquered
his
unwillingness
to
read
it
my
lord
i
shall
send
this
evening
to
your
eminence
in
order
to
reinforce
the
troop
of
monsieur
de
comminges
the
ten
men
you
demand
they
are
good
soldiers
fit
to
confront
the
two
violent
adversaries
whose
address
and
resolution
your
eminence
is
fearful
oh
cried
athos
well
said
aramis
what
think
you
about
these
two
enemies
whom
it
requires
besides
comminges
s
troop
ten
good
soldiers
to
confront
are
they
not
as
like
as
two
drops
of
water
to
d
artagnan
and
porthos
we
ll
search
paris
all
day
long
said
athos
and
if
we
have
no
news
this
evening
we
will
return
to
the
road
to
picardy
and
i
feel
no
doubt
that
thanks
to
d
artagnan
s
ready
invention
we
shall
then
find
some
clew
which
will
solve
our
yes
let
us
search
paris
and
especially
inquire
of
planchet
if
he
has
yet
heard
from
his
former
that
poor
planchet
you
speak
of
him
very
much
at
your
ease
aramis
he
has
probably
been
killed
all
those
fighting
citizens
went
out
to
battle
and
they
have
been
it
was
then
with
a
sentiment
of
uneasiness
whether
planchet
who
alone
could
give
them
information
was
alive
or
dead
that
the
friends
returned
to
the
place
royale
to
their
great
surprise
they
found
the
citizens
still
encamped
there
drinking
and
bantering
each
other
although
doubtless
mourned
by
their
families
who
thought
they
were
at
charenton
in
the
thickest
of
the
fighting
athos
and
aramis
again
questioned
planchet
but
he
had
seen
nothing
of
d
artagnan
they
wished
to
take
planchet
with
them
but
he
could
not
leave
his
troop
who
at
five
o
clock
returned
home
saying
that
they
were
returning
from
the
battle
whereas
they
had
never
lost
sight
of
the
bronze
equestrian
statue
of
louis
xiii
the
road
to
picardy
on
leaving
paris
athos
and
aramis
well
knew
that
they
would
be
encountering
great
danger
but
we
know
that
for
men
like
these
there
could
be
no
question
of
danger
besides
they
felt
that
the
denouement
of
this
second
odyssey
was
at
hand
and
that
there
remained
but
a
single
effort
to
make
besides
there
was
no
tranquillity
in
paris
itself
provisions
began
to
fail
and
whenever
one
of
the
prince
de
conti
s
generals
wished
to
gain
more
influence
he
got
up
a
little
popular
tumult
which
he
put
down
again
and
thus
for
the
moment
gained
a
superiority
over
his
colleagues
in
one
of
these
risings
the
duc
de
beaufort
pillaged
the
house
and
library
of
mazarin
in
order
to
give
the
populace
as
he
put
it
something
to
gnaw
at
athos
and
aramis
left
paris
after
this
etat
which
took
place
on
the
very
evening
of
the
day
in
which
the
parisians
had
been
beaten
at
charenton
they
quitted
paris
beholding
it
abandoned
to
extreme
want
bordering
on
famine
agitated
by
fear
torn
by
faction
parisians
and
frondeurs
as
they
were
the
two
friends
expected
to
find
the
same
misery
the
same
fears
the
same
intrigue
in
the
enemy
s
camp
but
what
was
their
surprise
after
passing
saint
denis
to
hear
that
at
saint
germain
people
were
singing
and
laughing
and
leading
generally
cheerful
lives
the
two
gentlemen
traveled
by
byways
in
order
not
to
encounter
the
mazarinists
scattered
about
the
isle
of
france
and
also
to
escape
the
frondeurs
who
were
in
possession
of
normandy
and
who
never
failed
to
conduct
captives
to
the
duc
de
longueville
in
order
that
he
might
ascertain
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
having
escaped
these
dangers
they
returned
by
the
main
road
to
boulogne
at
abbeville
and
followed
it
step
by
step
examining
every
track
nevertheless
they
were
still
in
a
state
of
uncertainty
several
inns
were
visited
by
them
several
innkeepers
questioned
without
a
single
clew
being
given
to
guide
their
inquiries
when
at
montreuil
athos
felt
upon
the
table
that
something
rough
was
touching
his
delicate
fingers
he
turned
up
the
cloth
and
found
these
hieroglyphics
carved
upon
the
wood
with
a
knife
port
d
art
this
is
capital
said
athos
to
aramis
we
were
to
have
slept
here
but
we
can
not
we
must
push
they
rode
forward
and
reached
abbeville
there
the
great
number
of
inns
puzzled
them
they
could
not
go
to
all
how
could
they
guess
in
which
those
whom
they
were
seeking
had
stayed
trust
me
said
aramis
do
not
expect
to
find
anything
in
abbeville
if
we
had
only
been
looking
for
porthos
porthos
would
have
stationed
himself
in
one
of
the
finest
hotels
and
we
could
easily
have
traced
him
but
d
artagnan
is
devoid
of
such
weaknesses
porthos
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
even
to
make
him
see
that
he
was
dying
of
hunger
he
has
gone
on
his
road
as
inexorable
as
fate
and
we
must
seek
him
somewhere
they
continued
their
route
it
had
now
become
a
weary
and
almost
hopeless
task
and
had
it
not
been
for
the
threefold
motives
of
honor
friendship
and
gratitude
implanted
in
their
hearts
our
two
travelers
would
have
given
up
many
a
time
their
rides
over
the
sand
their
interrogatories
of
the
peasantry
and
their
close
inspection
of
faces
they
proceeded
thus
to
peronne
athos
began
to
despair
his
noble
nature
felt
that
their
ignorance
was
a
sort
of
reflection
upon
them
they
had
not
looked
carefully
enough
for
their
lost
friends
they
had
not
shown
sufficient
pertinacity
in
their
inquiries
they
were
willing
and
ready
to
retrace
their
steps
when
in
crossing
the
suburb
which
leads
to
the
gates
of
the
town
upon
a
white
wall
which
was
at
the
corner
of
a
street
turning
around
the
rampart
athos
cast
his
eyes
upon
a
drawing
in
black
chalk
which
represented
with
the
awkwardness
of
a
first
attempt
two
cavaliers
riding
furiously
one
of
them
carried
a
roll
of
paper
on
which
were
written
these
words
they
are
following
oh
exclaimed
athos
here
it
is
as
clear
as
day
pursued
as
he
was
d
artagnan
would
not
have
tarried
here
five
minutes
had
he
been
pressed
very
closely
which
gives
us
hopes
that
he
may
have
succeeded
in
aramis
shook
his
head
had
he
escaped
we
should
either
have
seen
him
or
have
heard
him
spoken
you
are
right
aramis
let
us
travel
to
describe
the
impatience
and
anxiety
of
these
two
friends
would
be
impossible
uneasiness
took
possession
of
the
tender
constant
heart
of
athos
and
fearful
forecasts
were
the
torment
of
the
impulsive
aramis
they
galloped
on
for
two
or
three
hours
as
furiously
as
the
cavaliers
on
the
wall
all
at
once
in
a
narrow
pass
they
perceived
that
the
road
was
partially
barricaded
by
an
enormous
stone
it
had
evidently
been
rolled
across
the
pass
by
some
arm
of
giant
strength
aramis
stopped
oh
he
said
looking
at
the
stone
this
is
the
work
of
either
hercules
or
porthos
let
us
get
down
count
and
examine
this
they
both
alighted
the
stone
had
been
brought
with
the
evident
intention
of
barricading
the
road
but
some
one
having
perceived
the
obstacle
had
partially
turned
it
aside
with
the
assistance
of
blaisois
and
grimaud
the
friends
succeeded
in
turning
the
stone
over
upon
the
side
next
the
ground
were
scratched
the
following
words
eight
of
the
light
dragoons
are
pursuing
us
if
we
reach
compiegne
we
shall
stop
at
the
peacock
it
is
kept
by
a
friend
of
at
last
we
have
something
definite
said
athos
let
us
go
to
the
yes
answered
aramis
but
if
we
are
to
get
there
we
must
rest
our
horses
for
they
are
almost
aramis
was
right
they
stopped
at
the
first
tavern
and
made
each
horse
swallow
a
double
quantity
of
corn
steeped
in
wine
they
gave
them
three
hours
rest
and
then
set
off
again
the
men
themselves
were
almost
dead
with
fatigue
but
hope
supported
them
in
six
hours
they
reached
compiegne
and
alighted
at
the
peacock
the
host
proved
to
be
a
worthy
man
as
bald
as
a
chinaman
they
asked
him
if
some
time
ago
he
had
not
received
in
his
house
two
gentlemen
who
were
pursued
by
dragoons
without
answering
he
went
out
and
brought
in
the
blade
of
a
rapier
do
you
know
that
he
asked
athos
merely
glanced
at
it
tis
d
artagnan
s
sword
he
said
does
it
belong
to
the
smaller
or
to
the
larger
of
the
two
asked
the
host
to
the
i
see
that
you
are
the
friends
of
these
well
what
has
happened
to
them
they
were
pursued
by
eight
of
the
light
dragoons
who
rode
into
the
courtyard
before
they
had
time
to
close
the
eight
said
aramis
it
surprises
me
that
two
such
heroes
as
porthos
and
d
artagnan
should
have
allowed
themselves
to
be
arrested
by
eight
the
eight
men
would
doubtless
have
failed
had
they
not
been
assisted
by
twenty
soldiers
of
the
regiment
of
italians
in
the
king
s
service
who
are
in
garrison
in
this
town
so
that
your
friends
were
overpowered
by
arrested
were
they
inquired
athos
is
it
known
why
no
sir
they
were
carried
off
instantly
and
had
not
even
time
to
tell
me
why
but
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
i
found
this
broken
as
i
was
helping
to
raise
two
dead
men
and
five
or
six
wounded
tis
still
a
consolation
that
they
were
not
wounded
said
aramis
where
were
they
taken
asked
athos
toward
the
town
of
louvres
was
the
reply
the
two
friends
having
agreed
to
leave
blaisois
and
grimaud
at
compiegne
with
the
horses
resolved
to
take
post
horses
and
having
snatched
a
hasty
dinner
they
continued
their
journey
to
louvres
here
they
found
only
one
inn
in
which
was
consumed
a
liqueur
which
preserves
its
reputation
to
our
time
and
which
is
still
made
in
that
town
let
us
alight
here
said
athos
d
artagnan
will
not
have
let
slip
an
opportunity
of
drinking
a
glass
of
this
liqueur
and
at
the
same
time
leaving
some
trace
of
they
went
into
the
town
and
asked
for
two
glasses
of
liqueur
at
the
counter
as
their
friends
must
have
done
before
them
the
counter
was
covered
with
a
plate
of
pewter
upon
this
plate
was
written
with
the
point
of
a
large
pin
rueil
they
went
to
rueil
cried
aramis
let
us
go
to
rueil
said
athos
it
is
to
throw
ourselves
into
the
wolf
s
jaws
said
aramis
had
i
been
as
great
a
friend
of
jonah
as
i
am
of
d
artagnan
i
should
have
followed
him
even
into
the
inside
of
the
whale
itself
and
you
would
have
done
the
same
certainly
but
you
make
me
out
better
than
i
am
dear
count
had
i
been
alone
i
should
scarcely
have
gone
to
rueil
without
great
caution
but
where
you
go
i
they
then
set
off
for
rueil
here
the
deputies
of
the
parliament
had
just
arrived
in
order
to
enter
upon
those
famous
conferences
which
were
to
last
three
weeks
and
produced
eventually
that
shameful
peace
at
the
conclusion
of
which
the
prince
was
arrested
rueil
was
crowded
with
advocates
presidents
and
councillors
who
came
from
the
parisians
and
on
the
side
of
the
court
with
officers
and
guards
it
was
therefore
easy
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
to
remain
as
unobserved
as
any
one
might
wish
besides
the
conferences
implied
a
truce
and
to
arrest
two
gentlemen
even
frondeurs
at
this
time
would
have
been
an
attack
on
the
rights
of
the
people
the
two
friends
mingled
with
the
crowd
and
fancied
that
every
one
was
occupied
with
the
same
thought
that
tormented
them
they
expected
to
hear
some
mention
made
of
d
artagnan
or
of
porthos
but
every
one
was
engrossed
by
articles
and
reforms
it
was
the
advice
of
athos
to
go
straight
to
the
minister
my
friend
said
aramis
take
care
our
safety
lies
in
our
obscurity
if
we
were
to
make
ourselves
known
we
should
be
sent
to
rejoin
our
friends
in
some
deep
ditch
from
which
the
devil
himself
could
not
take
us
out
let
us
try
not
to
find
them
out
by
accident
but
from
our
notions
arrested
at
compiegne
they
have
been
carried
to
rueil
at
rueil
they
have
been
questioned
by
the
cardinal
who
has
either
kept
them
near
him
or
sent
them
to
saint
germain
as
to
the
bastile
they
are
not
there
though
the
bastile
is
especially
for
the
frondeurs
they
are
not
dead
for
the
death
of
d
artagnan
would
make
a
sensation
as
for
porthos
i
believe
him
to
be
eternal
like
god
although
less
patient
do
not
let
us
despond
but
wait
at
rueil
for
my
conviction
is
that
they
are
at
rueil
but
what
ails
you
you
are
it
is
this
answered
athos
with
a
trembling
voice
i
remember
that
at
the
castle
of
rueil
the
cardinal
richelieu
had
some
horrible
oubliettes
oh
never
fear
said
aramis
richelieu
was
a
gentleman
our
equal
in
birth
our
superior
in
position
he
could
like
the
king
touch
the
greatest
of
us
on
the
head
and
touching
them
make
such
heads
shake
on
their
shoulders
but
mazarin
is
a
rogue
who
can
at
the
most
take
us
by
the
collar
like
an
archer
be
calm
for
i
am
sure
that
d
artagnan
and
porthos
are
at
rueil
alive
and
but
resumed
athos
i
recur
to
my
first
proposal
i
know
no
better
means
than
to
act
with
candor
i
shall
seek
not
mazarin
but
the
queen
and
say
to
her
madame
restore
to
us
your
two
servants
and
our
two
aramis
shook
his
head
tis
a
last
resource
but
let
us
not
employ
it
till
it
is
imperatively
called
for
let
us
rather
persevere
in
our
they
continued
their
inquiries
and
at
last
met
with
a
light
dragoon
who
had
formed
one
of
the
guard
which
had
escorted
d
artagnan
to
rueil
athos
however
perpetually
recurred
to
his
proposed
interview
with
the
queen
in
order
to
see
the
queen
said
aramis
we
must
first
see
the
cardinal
and
when
we
have
seen
the
cardinal
remember
what
i
tell
you
athos
we
shall
be
reunited
to
our
friends
but
not
in
the
way
you
wish
now
that
way
of
joining
them
is
not
very
attractive
to
me
i
confess
let
us
act
in
freedom
that
we
may
act
well
and
i
shall
go
he
said
to
the
well
then
answered
aramis
pray
tell
me
a
day
or
two
beforehand
that
i
may
take
that
opportunity
of
going
to
to
whom
zounds
how
do
i
know
perhaps
to
madame
de
longueville
she
is
yonder
she
will
help
me
but
send
me
word
should
you
be
arrested
for
then
i
will
return
why
do
you
not
take
your
chance
and
be
arrested
with
me
no
i
thank
should
we
by
being
arrested
be
all
four
together
again
we
should
not
i
am
not
sure
be
hours
in
prison
without
getting
my
friend
since
i
killed
chatillon
adored
of
the
ladies
of
saint
germain
i
am
too
great
a
celebrity
not
to
fear
a
prison
doubly
the
queen
is
likely
to
follow
mazarin
s
counsels
and
to
have
me
do
you
think
she
loves
this
italian
so
much
as
they
say
she
does
did
she
not
love
an
englishman
my
friend
she
is
a
no
no
you
are
deceived
she
is
a
dear
friend
i
shall
sacrifice
myself
and
go
and
see
anne
of
adieu
athos
i
am
going
to
raise
an
for
what
purpose
to
come
back
and
besiege
where
shall
we
meet
again
at
the
foot
of
the
cardinal
s
the
two
friends
departed
aramis
to
return
to
paris
athos
to
take
measures
preparatory
to
an
interview
with
the
queen
the
gratitude
of
anne
of
austria
athos
found
much
less
difficulty
than
he
had
expected
in
obtaining
an
audience
of
anne
of
austria
it
was
granted
and
was
to
take
place
after
her
morning
s
levee
at
which
in
accordance
with
his
rights
of
birth
he
was
entitled
to
be
present
a
vast
crowd
filled
the
apartments
of
saint
germain
anne
had
never
at
the
louvre
had
so
large
a
court
but
this
crowd
represented
chiefly
the
second
class
of
nobility
while
the
prince
de
conti
the
duc
de
beaufort
and
the
coadjutor
assembled
around
them
the
first
nobility
of
france
the
greatest
possible
gayety
prevailed
at
court
the
particular
characteristic
of
this
was
that
more
songs
were
made
than
cannons
fired
during
its
continuance
the
court
made
songs
on
the
parisians
and
the
parisians
on
the
court
and
the
casualties
though
not
mortal
were
painful
as
are
all
wounds
inflicted
by
the
weapon
of
ridicule
in
the
midst
of
this
seeming
hilarity
nevertheless
people
s
minds
were
uneasy
was
mazarin
to
remain
the
favorite
and
minister
of
the
queen
was
he
to
be
carried
back
by
the
wind
which
had
blown
him
there
every
one
hoped
so
so
that
the
minister
felt
that
all
around
him
beneath
the
homage
of
the
courtiers
lay
a
fund
of
hatred
ill
disguised
by
fear
and
interest
he
felt
ill
at
ease
and
at
a
loss
what
to
do
conde
himself
whilst
fighting
for
him
lost
no
opportunity
of
ridiculing
of
humbling
him
the
queen
on
whom
he
threw
himself
as
sole
support
seemed
to
him
now
not
much
to
be
relied
upon
when
the
hour
appointed
for
the
audience
arrived
athos
was
obliged
to
stay
until
the
queen
who
was
waited
upon
by
a
new
deputation
from
paris
had
consulted
with
her
minister
as
to
the
propriety
and
manner
of
receiving
them
all
were
fully
engrossed
with
the
affairs
of
the
day
athos
could
not
therefore
have
chosen
a
more
inauspicious
moment
to
speak
of
his
friends
poor
atoms
lost
in
that
raging
whirlwind
but
athos
was
a
man
of
inflexible
determination
he
firmly
adhered
to
a
purpose
once
formed
when
it
seemed
to
him
to
spring
from
conscience
and
to
be
prompted
by
a
sense
of
duty
he
insisted
on
being
introduced
saying
that
although
he
was
not
a
deputy
from
monsieur
de
conti
or
monsieur
de
beaufort
or
monsieur
de
bouillon
or
monsieur
d
elbeuf
or
the
coadjutor
or
madame
de
longueville
or
broussel
or
the
parliament
and
although
he
had
come
on
his
own
private
account
he
nevertheless
had
things
to
say
to
her
majesty
of
the
utmost
importance
the
conference
being
finished
the
queen
summoned
him
to
her
cabinet
athos
was
introduced
and
announced
by
name
it
was
a
name
that
too
often
resounded
in
her
majesty
s
ears
and
too
often
vibrated
in
her
heart
for
anne
of
austria
not
to
recognize
it
yet
she
remained
impassive
looking
at
him
with
that
fixed
stare
which
is
tolerated
only
in
women
who
are
queens
either
by
the
power
of
beauty
or
by
the
right
of
birth
it
is
then
a
service
which
you
propose
to
render
us
count
asked
anne
of
austria
after
a
moment
s
silence
yes
madame
another
service
said
athos
shocked
that
the
queen
did
not
seem
to
recognize
him
athos
had
a
noble
heart
and
made
therefore
but
a
poor
courtier
anne
frowned
mazarin
who
was
sitting
at
a
table
folding
up
papers
as
if
he
had
only
been
a
secretary
of
state
looked
up
speak
said
the
queen
mazarin
turned
again
to
his
papers
madame
resumed
athos
two
of
my
friends
named
d
artagnan
and
monsieur
du
vallon
sent
to
england
by
the
cardinal
suddenly
disappeared
when
they
set
foot
on
the
shores
of
france
no
one
knows
what
has
become
of
well
said
the
queen
i
address
myself
therefore
first
to
the
benevolence
of
your
majesty
that
i
may
know
what
has
become
of
my
friends
reserving
to
myself
if
necessary
the
right
of
appealing
hereafter
to
your
sir
replied
anne
with
a
degree
of
haughtiness
which
to
certain
persons
became
impertinence
this
is
the
reason
that
you
trouble
me
in
the
midst
of
so
many
absorbing
concerns
an
affair
for
the
police
well
sir
you
ought
to
know
that
we
no
longer
have
a
police
since
we
are
no
longer
at
i
think
your
majesty
will
have
no
need
to
apply
to
the
police
to
know
where
my
friends
are
but
that
if
you
will
deign
to
interrogate
the
cardinal
he
can
reply
without
any
further
inquiry
than
into
his
own
but
god
forgive
me
cried
anne
with
that
disdainful
curl
of
the
lips
peculiar
to
her
i
believe
that
you
are
yourself
yes
madame
here
i
have
a
right
to
do
so
for
it
concerns
monsieur
d
artagnan
artagnan
he
repeated
in
such
a
manner
as
to
bow
the
regal
brow
with
recollections
of
the
weak
and
erring
woman
the
cardinal
saw
that
it
was
now
high
time
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
anne
sir
he
said
i
can
tell
you
what
is
at
present
unknown
to
her
majesty
these
individuals
are
under
arrest
they
disobeyed
i
beg
of
your
majesty
then
said
athos
calmly
and
not
replying
to
mazarin
to
quash
these
arrests
of
messieurs
d
artagnan
and
du
what
you
ask
is
merely
an
affair
of
discipline
and
does
not
concern
me
said
the
queen
monsieur
d
artagnan
never
made
such
an
answer
as
that
when
the
service
of
your
majesty
was
concerned
said
athos
bowing
with
great
dignity
he
was
going
toward
the
door
when
mazarin
stopped
him
you
too
have
been
in
england
sir
he
said
making
a
sign
to
the
queen
who
was
evidently
going
to
issue
a
severe
order
i
was
a
witness
of
the
last
hours
of
charles
i
poor
king
culpable
at
the
most
of
weakness
how
cruelly
punished
by
his
subjects
thrones
are
at
this
time
shaken
and
it
is
to
little
purpose
for
devoted
hearts
to
serve
the
interests
of
princes
this
is
the
second
time
that
monsieur
d
artagnan
has
been
in
england
he
went
the
first
time
to
save
the
honor
of
a
great
queen
the
second
to
avert
the
death
of
a
great
sir
said
anne
to
mazarin
with
an
accent
from
which
daily
habits
of
dissimulation
could
not
entirely
chase
the
real
expression
see
if
we
can
do
something
for
these
i
wish
to
do
madame
all
that
your
majesty
do
what
monsieur
de
la
fere
requests
that
is
your
name
is
it
not
sir
i
have
another
name
madame
i
am
called
madame
said
mazarin
with
a
smile
you
may
rest
easy
your
wishes
shall
be
you
hear
sir
said
the
queen
yes
madame
i
expected
nothing
less
from
the
justice
of
your
majesty
may
i
not
go
and
see
my
friends
yes
sir
you
shall
see
them
but
apropos
you
belong
to
the
fronde
do
you
not
madame
i
serve
the
yes
in
your
own
my
way
is
the
way
of
all
gentlemen
and
i
know
only
one
way
answered
athos
haughtily
go
sir
then
said
the
queen
you
have
obtained
what
you
wish
and
we
know
all
we
desire
to
scarcely
however
had
the
tapestry
closed
behind
athos
when
she
said
to
mazarin
cardinal
desire
them
to
arrest
that
insolent
fellow
before
he
leaves
the
your
majesty
answered
mazarin
desires
me
to
do
only
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
let
me
do
these
bravoes
who
resuscitate
in
our
epoch
the
traditions
of
another
reign
are
troublesome
since
there
are
two
of
them
already
there
let
us
add
a
athos
was
not
altogether
the
queen
s
dupe
but
he
was
not
a
man
to
run
away
on
suspicion
above
all
when
distinctly
told
that
he
should
see
his
friends
again
he
waited
then
in
the
with
impatience
till
he
should
be
conducted
to
them
he
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
into
the
court
he
saw
the
deputation
from
the
parisians
enter
it
they
were
coming
to
assign
the
definitive
place
for
the
conference
and
to
make
their
bow
to
the
queen
a
very
imposing
escort
awaited
them
without
the
gates
athos
was
looking
on
attentively
when
some
one
touched
him
softly
on
the
shoulder
ah
monsieur
de
comminges
he
said
yes
count
and
charged
with
a
commission
for
which
i
beg
of
you
to
accept
my
what
is
it
be
so
good
as
to
give
me
up
your
sword
athos
smiled
and
opened
the
window
aramis
he
cried
a
gentleman
turned
around
athos
fancied
he
had
seen
him
among
the
crowd
it
was
aramis
he
bowed
with
great
friendship
to
the
count
aramis
cried
athos
i
am
good
replied
aramis
calmly
sir
said
athos
turning
to
comminges
and
giving
him
politely
his
sword
by
the
hilt
here
is
my
sword
have
the
kindness
to
keep
it
safely
for
me
until
i
quit
my
prison
i
prize
it
it
was
given
to
my
ancestor
by
king
francis
i
in
his
time
they
armed
gentlemen
not
disarmed
them
now
whither
do
you
conduct
me
into
my
room
first
replied
comminges
the
queen
will
ultimately
decide
your
place
of
athos
followed
comminges
without
saying
a
single
word
cardinal
mazarin
as
king
the
arrest
produced
no
sensation
indeed
was
almost
unknown
and
scarcely
interrupted
the
course
of
events
to
the
deputation
it
was
formally
announced
that
the
queen
would
receive
it
accordingly
it
was
admitted
to
the
presence
of
anne
who
silent
and
lofty
as
ever
listened
to
the
speeches
and
complaints
of
the
deputies
but
when
they
had
finished
their
harangues
not
one
of
them
could
say
so
calm
remained
her
face
whether
or
no
she
had
heard
them
on
the
other
hand
mazarin
present
at
that
audience
heard
very
well
what
those
deputies
demanded
it
was
purely
and
simply
his
removal
in
terms
clear
and
precise
the
discourse
being
finished
the
queen
remained
silent
gentlemen
said
mazarin
i
join
with
you
in
supplicating
the
queen
to
put
an
end
to
the
miseries
of
her
subjects
i
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
ameliorate
them
and
yet
the
belief
of
the
public
you
say
is
that
they
proceed
from
me
an
unhappy
foreigner
who
has
been
unable
to
please
the
french
alas
i
have
never
been
understood
and
no
wonder
i
succeeded
a
man
of
the
most
sublime
genius
that
ever
upheld
the
sceptre
of
france
the
memory
of
richelieu
annihilates
me
in
vain
were
i
an
ambitious
man
should
i
struggle
against
such
remembrances
as
he
has
left
but
that
i
am
not
ambitious
i
am
going
to
prove
to
you
i
own
myself
conquered
i
shall
obey
the
wishes
of
the
people
if
paris
has
injuries
to
complain
of
who
has
not
some
wrongs
to
be
redressed
paris
has
been
sufficiently
punished
enough
blood
has
flowed
enough
misery
has
humbled
a
town
deprived
of
its
king
and
of
justice
tis
not
for
me
a
private
individual
to
disunite
a
queen
from
her
kingdom
since
you
demand
my
resignation
i
then
said
aramis
in
his
neighbor
s
ear
the
conferences
are
over
there
is
nothing
to
do
but
to
send
monsieur
mazarin
to
the
most
distant
frontier
and
to
take
care
that
he
does
not
return
even
by
that
nor
any
other
entrance
into
one
instant
sir
said
the
man
in
a
gown
whom
he
addressed
a
plague
on
t
how
fast
you
go
one
may
soon
see
that
you
re
a
soldier
there
s
the
article
of
remunerations
and
indemnifications
to
be
discussed
and
set
to
chancellor
said
the
queen
turning
to
seguier
our
old
acquaintance
you
will
open
the
conferences
they
can
take
place
at
rueil
the
cardinal
has
said
several
things
which
have
agitated
me
therefore
i
will
not
speak
more
fully
now
as
to
his
going
or
staying
i
feel
too
much
gratitude
to
the
cardinal
not
to
leave
him
free
in
all
his
actions
he
shall
do
what
he
wishes
to
a
transient
pallor
overspread
the
speaking
countenance
of
the
prime
minister
he
looked
at
the
queen
with
anxiety
her
face
was
so
passionless
that
he
as
every
one
else
present
was
incapable
of
reading
her
thoughts
but
added
the
queen
in
awaiting
the
cardinal
s
decision
let
there
be
if
you
please
a
reference
to
the
king
the
deputies
bowed
and
left
the
room
what
exclaimed
the
queen
when
the
last
of
them
had
quitted
the
apartment
you
would
yield
to
these
limbs
of
the
law
these
advocates
to
promote
your
majesty
s
welfare
madame
replied
mazarin
fixing
his
penetrating
eyes
on
the
queen
there
is
no
sacrifice
that
i
would
not
anne
dropped
her
head
and
fell
into
one
of
those
reveries
so
habitual
with
her
a
recollection
of
athos
came
into
her
mind
his
fearless
deportment
his
words
so
firm
yet
dignified
the
shades
which
by
one
word
he
had
evoked
recalled
to
her
the
past
in
all
its
intoxication
of
poetry
and
romance
youth
beauty
the
eclat
of
love
at
twenty
years
of
age
the
bloody
death
of
buckingham
the
only
man
whom
she
had
ever
really
loved
and
the
heroism
of
those
obscure
champions
who
had
saved
her
from
the
double
hatred
of
richelieu
and
the
king
mazarin
looked
at
her
and
whilst
she
deemed
herself
alone
and
freed
from
the
world
of
enemies
who
sought
to
spy
into
her
secret
thoughts
he
read
her
thoughts
in
her
countenance
as
one
sees
in
a
transparent
lake
clouds
pass
reflections
like
thoughts
of
the
heavens
must
we
then
asked
anne
of
austria
yield
to
the
storm
buy
peace
and
patiently
and
piously
await
better
times
mazarin
smiled
sarcastically
at
this
speech
which
showed
that
she
had
taken
the
minister
s
proposal
seriously
anne
s
head
was
bent
down
she
had
not
seen
the
italian
s
smile
but
finding
that
her
question
elicited
no
reply
she
looked
up
well
you
do
not
answer
cardinal
what
do
you
think
about
it
i
am
thinking
madame
of
the
allusion
made
by
that
insolent
gentleman
whom
you
have
caused
to
be
arrested
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
him
whom
you
allowed
to
be
assassinated
to
the
duchess
de
chevreuse
whom
you
suffered
to
be
exiled
to
the
duc
de
beaufort
whom
you
imprisoned
but
if
he
made
allusion
to
me
it
was
because
he
is
ignorant
of
the
relation
in
which
i
stand
to
anne
drew
up
as
she
always
did
when
anything
touched
her
pride
she
blushed
and
that
she
might
not
answer
clasped
her
beautiful
hands
till
her
sharp
nails
almost
pierced
them
that
man
has
sagacity
honor
and
wit
not
to
mention
likewise
that
he
is
a
man
of
undoubted
resolution
you
know
something
about
him
do
you
not
madame
i
shall
tell
him
therefore
and
in
doing
so
i
shall
confer
a
personal
favor
on
him
how
he
is
mistaken
in
regard
to
me
what
is
proposed
to
me
would
be
in
fact
almost
an
abdication
and
an
abdication
requires
an
abdication
repeated
anne
i
thought
sir
that
it
was
kings
alone
who
abdicated
well
replied
mazarin
and
am
i
not
almost
a
king
king
indeed
of
france
thrown
over
the
foot
of
the
royal
bed
my
simar
madame
looks
not
unlike
the
mantle
worn
by
this
was
one
of
the
humiliations
which
mazarin
made
anne
undergo
more
frequently
than
any
other
and
one
that
bowed
her
head
with
shame
queen
elizabeth
and
catherine
ii
of
russia
are
the
only
two
monarchs
of
their
set
on
record
who
were
at
once
sovereigns
and
lovers
anne
of
austria
looked
with
a
sort
of
terror
at
the
threatening
aspect
of
the
cardinal
his
physiognomy
in
such
moments
was
not
destitute
of
a
certain
grandeur
sir
she
replied
did
i
not
say
and
did
you
not
hear
me
say
to
those
people
that
you
should
do
as
you
pleased
in
that
case
said
mazarin
i
think
it
must
please
me
best
to
remain
not
only
on
account
of
my
own
interest
but
for
your
remain
then
sir
nothing
can
be
more
agreeable
to
me
only
do
not
allow
me
to
be
you
are
referring
to
the
demands
of
the
rebels
and
to
the
tone
in
which
they
stated
them
patience
they
have
selected
a
field
of
battle
on
which
i
am
an
abler
general
than
they
that
of
a
conference
no
we
shall
beat
them
by
merely
temporizing
they
want
food
already
they
will
be
ten
times
worse
off
in
a
ah
yes
good
heavens
i
know
it
will
end
in
that
way
but
it
is
not
they
who
taunt
me
with
the
most
wounding
reproaches
but
i
understand
you
mean
to
allude
to
the
recollections
perpetually
revived
by
these
three
gentlemen
however
we
have
them
safe
in
prison
and
they
are
just
sufficiently
culpable
for
us
to
keep
them
in
prison
as
long
as
we
find
it
convenient
one
only
is
still
not
in
our
power
and
braves
us
but
devil
take
him
we
shall
soon
succeed
in
sending
him
to
join
his
boon
companions
we
have
accomplished
more
difficult
things
than
that
in
the
first
place
i
have
as
a
precaution
shut
up
at
rueil
near
me
under
my
own
eyes
within
reach
of
my
hand
the
two
most
intractable
ones
the
third
will
be
there
as
long
as
they
are
in
prison
all
will
be
well
said
anne
but
one
of
these
days
they
will
get
yes
if
your
majesty
releases
ah
exclaimed
anne
following
the
train
of
her
own
thoughts
on
such
occasions
one
regrets
paris
why
so
on
account
of
the
bastile
sir
which
is
so
strong
and
so
madame
these
conferences
will
bring
us
peace
when
we
have
peace
we
shall
regain
paris
with
paris
the
bastile
and
our
four
bullies
shall
rot
anne
frowned
slightly
when
mazarin
in
taking
leave
kissed
her
hand
mazarin
after
this
half
humble
half
gallant
attention
went
away
anne
followed
him
with
her
eyes
and
as
he
withdrew
at
every
step
he
took
a
disdainful
smile
was
seen
playing
then
gradually
burst
upon
her
lips
i
once
she
said
despised
the
love
of
a
cardinal
who
never
said
i
shall
do
but
i
have
done
so
and
that
man
knew
of
retreats
more
secure
than
rueil
darker
and
more
silent
even
than
the
bastile
degenerate
world
precautions
after
quitting
anne
mazarin
took
the
road
to
rueil
where
he
usually
resided
in
those
times
of
disturbance
he
went
about
with
numerous
followers
and
often
disguised
himself
in
military
dress
he
was
indeed
as
we
have
stated
a
very
handsome
man
in
the
court
of
the
old
chateau
of
saint
germain
he
entered
his
coach
and
reached
the
seine
at
chatou
the
prince
had
supplied
him
with
fifty
light
horse
not
so
much
by
way
of
guard
as
to
show
the
deputies
how
readily
the
queen
s
generals
dispersed
their
troops
and
to
prove
that
they
might
be
safely
scattered
at
pleasure
athos
on
horseback
without
his
sword
and
kept
in
sight
by
comminges
followed
the
cardinal
in
silence
grimaud
finding
that
his
master
had
been
arrested
fell
back
into
the
ranks
near
aramis
without
saying
a
word
and
as
if
nothing
had
happened
grimaud
had
indeed
during
years
of
service
seen
his
master
extricate
himself
from
so
many
difficulties
that
nothing
less
than
athos
s
imminent
death
was
likely
to
make
him
uneasy
at
the
branching
off
of
the
road
toward
paris
aramis
who
had
followed
in
the
cardinal
s
suite
turned
back
mazarin
went
to
the
right
hand
and
aramis
could
see
the
prisoner
disappear
at
the
turning
of
the
avenue
athos
at
the
same
moment
moved
by
a
similar
impulse
looked
back
also
the
two
friends
exchanged
a
simple
inclination
of
the
head
and
aramis
put
his
finger
to
his
hat
as
if
to
bow
athos
alone
comprehending
by
that
signal
that
he
had
some
project
in
his
head
ten
minutes
afterward
mazarin
entered
the
court
of
that
chateau
which
his
predecessor
had
built
for
him
at
rueil
as
he
alighted
comminges
approached
him
my
lord
he
asked
where
does
your
eminence
wish
monsieur
comte
de
la
fere
to
be
lodged
in
the
pavilion
of
the
orangery
of
course
in
front
of
the
pavilion
where
the
guard
is
i
wish
every
respect
to
be
shown
the
count
although
he
is
the
prisoner
of
her
majesty
the
my
lord
answered
comminges
he
begs
to
be
taken
to
the
place
where
monsieur
d
artagnan
is
confined
that
is
in
the
hunting
lodge
opposite
the
mazarin
thought
for
an
instant
comminges
saw
that
he
was
undecided
tis
a
very
strong
post
he
resumed
and
we
have
forty
good
men
tried
soldiers
having
no
connection
with
frondeurs
nor
any
interest
in
the
if
we
put
these
three
men
together
monsieur
comminges
said
mazarin
we
must
double
the
guard
and
we
are
not
rich
enough
in
fighting
men
to
commit
such
acts
of
comminges
smiled
mazarin
read
and
construed
that
smile
you
do
not
know
these
men
monsieur
comminges
but
i
know
them
first
personally
also
by
hearsay
i
sent
them
to
carry
aid
to
king
charles
and
they
performed
prodigies
to
save
him
had
it
not
been
for
an
adverse
destiny
that
beloved
monarch
would
this
day
have
been
among
but
since
they
served
your
eminence
so
well
why
are
they
my
lord
cardinal
in
prison
in
prison
said
mazarin
and
when
has
rueil
been
a
prison
ever
since
there
were
prisoners
in
it
answered
comminges
these
gentlemen
comminges
are
not
prisoners
returned
mazarin
with
his
ironical
smile
only
guests
but
guests
so
precious
that
i
have
put
a
grating
before
each
of
their
windows
and
bolts
to
their
doors
that
they
may
not
refuse
to
continue
my
visitors
so
much
do
i
esteem
them
that
i
am
going
to
make
the
comte
de
la
fere
a
visit
that
i
may
converse
with
him
and
that
we
may
not
be
disturbed
at
our
interview
you
must
conduct
him
as
i
said
before
to
the
pavilion
of
the
orangery
that
you
know
is
my
daily
promenade
well
while
taking
my
walk
i
will
call
on
him
and
we
will
talk
although
he
professes
to
be
my
enemy
i
have
sympathy
for
him
and
if
he
is
reasonable
perhaps
we
shall
arrange
comminges
bowed
and
returned
to
athos
who
was
awaiting
with
apparent
calmness
but
with
real
anxiety
the
result
of
the
interview
well
he
said
to
the
lieutenant
sir
replied
comminges
it
seems
that
it
is
monsieur
de
comminges
said
athos
i
have
been
a
soldier
all
my
life
and
i
know
the
force
of
orders
but
outside
your
orders
there
is
a
service
you
can
render
i
will
do
it
with
all
my
heart
said
comminges
for
i
know
who
you
are
and
what
service
you
once
performed
for
her
majesty
i
know
too
how
dear
to
you
is
the
young
man
who
came
so
valiantly
to
my
aid
when
that
old
rogue
of
a
broussel
was
arrested
i
am
entirely
at
your
service
except
only
for
my
thank
you
sir
what
i
am
about
to
ask
will
not
compromise
you
in
any
if
it
should
even
compromise
me
a
little
said
monsieur
de
comminges
with
a
smile
still
make
your
demand
i
don
t
like
mazarin
any
better
than
you
do
i
serve
the
queen
and
that
draws
me
naturally
into
the
service
of
the
cardinal
but
i
serve
the
one
with
joy
and
the
other
against
my
will
speak
then
i
beg
of
you
i
wait
and
since
there
is
no
harm
said
athos
in
my
knowing
that
d
artagnan
is
here
i
presume
there
will
be
none
in
his
knowing
that
i
am
i
have
received
no
orders
on
that
well
then
do
me
the
kindness
to
give
him
my
regards
and
tell
him
that
i
am
his
neighbor
tell
him
also
what
you
have
just
told
me
that
mazarin
has
placed
me
in
the
pavilion
of
the
orangery
in
order
to
make
me
a
visit
and
assure
him
that
i
shall
take
advantage
of
this
honor
he
proposes
to
accord
to
me
to
obtain
from
him
some
amelioration
of
our
which
can
not
last
interrupted
comminges
the
cardinal
said
so
there
is
no
prison
but
there
are
oubliettes
replied
athos
smiling
oh
that
s
a
different
thing
yes
i
know
there
are
traditions
of
that
sort
said
comminges
it
was
in
the
time
of
the
other
cardinal
who
was
a
great
nobleman
but
our
mazarin
impossible
an
italian
adventurer
would
not
dare
to
go
such
lengths
with
such
men
as
ourselves
oubliettes
are
employed
as
a
means
of
kingly
vengeance
and
a
fellow
such
as
he
is
would
not
have
recourse
to
them
your
arrest
is
known
that
of
your
friends
will
soon
be
known
and
all
the
nobility
of
france
would
demand
an
explanation
of
your
disappearance
no
no
be
easy
on
that
score
i
will
however
inform
monsieur
d
artagnan
of
your
arrival
comminges
then
led
the
count
to
a
room
on
the
ground
floor
of
a
pavilion
at
the
end
of
the
orangery
they
passed
through
a
courtyard
as
they
went
full
of
soldiers
and
courtiers
in
the
centre
of
this
court
in
the
form
of
a
horseshoe
were
the
buildings
occupied
by
mazarin
and
at
each
wing
the
pavilion
or
smaller
building
where
d
artagnan
was
confined
and
that
level
with
the
orangery
where
athos
was
to
be
from
the
ends
of
these
two
wings
extended
the
park
athos
when
he
reached
his
appointed
room
observed
through
the
gratings
of
his
window
walls
and
roofs
and
was
told
on
inquiry
by
comminges
that
he
was
looking
on
the
back
of
the
pavilion
where
d
artagnan
was
confined
yes
tis
too
true
said
comminges
tis
almost
a
prison
but
what
a
singular
fancy
this
is
of
yours
count
you
who
are
the
very
flower
of
our
nobility
to
squander
your
valor
and
loyalty
amongst
these
upstarts
the
frondists
really
count
if
ever
i
thought
that
i
had
a
friend
in
the
ranks
of
the
royal
army
it
was
you
a
frondeur
you
the
comte
de
la
fere
on
the
side
of
broussel
blancmesnil
and
viole
for
shame
you
a
frondeur
on
my
word
of
honor
said
athos
one
must
be
either
a
mazarinist
or
a
frondeur
for
a
long
time
i
had
these
words
whispered
in
my
ears
and
i
chose
the
latter
at
any
rate
it
is
a
french
word
and
now
i
am
a
frondeur
not
of
broussel
s
party
nor
of
blancmesnil
s
nor
am
i
with
viole
but
with
the
duc
de
beaufort
the
ducs
de
bouillon
and
d
elbeuf
with
princes
not
with
presidents
councillors
and
lawyers
besides
what
a
charming
outlook
it
would
have
been
to
serve
the
cardinal
look
at
that
wall
without
a
single
window
which
tells
you
fine
things
about
mazarin
s
gratitude
yes
replied
de
comminges
more
especially
if
it
could
reveal
how
monsieur
d
artagnan
for
this
last
week
has
been
anathematizing
poor
d
artagnan
said
athos
with
the
charming
melancholy
that
was
one
of
the
traits
of
his
character
so
brave
so
good
so
terrible
to
the
enemies
of
those
he
loves
you
have
two
unruly
prisoners
there
unruly
comminges
smiled
you
wish
to
terrify
me
i
suppose
when
he
came
here
monsieur
d
artagnan
provoked
and
braved
the
soldiers
and
inferior
officers
in
order
i
suppose
to
have
his
sword
back
that
mood
lasted
some
time
but
now
he
s
as
gentle
as
a
lamb
and
sings
gascon
songs
which
make
one
die
of
and
du
vallon
asked
athos
ah
he
s
quite
another
sort
of
person
a
formidable
gentleman
indeed
the
first
day
he
broke
all
the
doors
in
with
a
single
push
of
his
shoulder
and
i
expected
to
see
him
leave
rueil
in
the
same
way
as
samson
left
gaza
but
his
temper
cooled
down
like
his
friend
s
he
not
only
gets
used
to
his
captivity
but
jokes
about
so
much
the
better
said
athos
do
you
think
anything
else
was
to
be
expected
of
them
asked
comminges
who
putting
together
what
mazarin
had
said
of
his
prisoners
and
what
the
comte
de
la
fere
had
said
began
to
feel
a
degree
of
uneasiness
athos
on
the
other
hand
reflected
that
this
recent
gentleness
of
his
friends
most
certainly
arose
from
some
plan
formed
by
d
artagnan
unwilling
to
injure
them
by
praising
them
too
highly
he
replied
they
they
are
two
hotheads
the
one
a
gascon
the
other
from
picardy
both
are
easily
excited
but
they
quiet
down
immediately
you
have
had
a
proof
of
that
in
what
you
have
just
related
to
this
too
was
the
opinion
of
comminges
who
withdrew
somewhat
reassured
athos
remained
alone
in
the
vast
chamber
where
according
to
the
cardinal
s
directions
he
was
treated
with
all
the
courtesy
due
to
a
nobleman
he
awaited
mazarin
s
promised
visit
to
get
some
light
on
his
present
situation
strength
and
sagacity
now
let
us
pass
the
orangery
to
the
hunting
lodge
at
the
extremity
of
the
courtyard
where
close
to
a
portico
formed
of
ionic
columns
were
the
dog
kennels
rose
an
oblong
building
the
pavilion
of
the
orangery
a
half
circle
inclosing
the
court
of
honor
it
was
in
this
pavilion
on
the
ground
floor
that
d
artagnan
and
porthos
were
confined
suffering
interminable
hours
of
imprisonment
in
a
manner
suitable
to
each
different
temperament
d
artagnan
was
pacing
to
and
fro
like
a
caged
tiger
with
dilated
eyes
growling
as
he
paced
along
by
the
bars
of
a
window
looking
upon
the
yard
of
servant
s
offices
porthos
was
ruminating
over
an
excellent
dinner
he
had
just
demolished
the
one
seemed
to
be
deprived
of
reason
yet
he
was
meditating
the
other
seemed
to
meditate
yet
he
was
more
than
half
asleep
but
his
sleep
was
a
nightmare
which
might
be
guessed
by
the
incoherent
manner
in
which
he
sometimes
snored
and
sometimes
snorted
look
said
d
artagnan
day
is
declining
it
must
be
nearly
four
o
clock
we
have
been
in
this
place
nearly
hem
muttered
porthos
with
a
kind
of
pretense
of
answering
did
you
hear
eternal
sleeper
cried
d
artagnan
irritated
that
any
one
could
doze
during
the
day
when
he
had
the
greatest
difficulty
in
sleeping
during
the
night
what
said
porthos
i
say
we
have
been
here
tis
your
fault
answered
porthos
how
my
fault
yes
i
offered
you
by
pulling
out
a
bar
and
pushing
down
a
door
porthos
men
like
us
can
t
go
out
from
here
purely
and
faith
said
porthos
as
for
me
i
could
go
out
with
that
purity
and
that
simplicity
which
it
seems
to
me
you
despise
too
d
artagnan
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
besides
he
said
going
out
of
this
chamber
isn
t
dear
friend
said
porthos
you
appear
to
be
in
a
somewhat
better
humor
than
you
were
yesterday
explain
to
me
why
going
out
of
this
chamber
isn
t
because
having
neither
arms
nor
password
we
shouldn
t
take
fifty
steps
in
the
court
without
knocking
against
a
very
well
said
porthos
we
will
kill
the
sentinel
and
we
shall
have
his
yes
but
before
we
can
kill
him
and
he
will
be
hard
to
kill
that
swiss
he
will
shriek
out
and
the
whole
picket
will
come
and
we
shall
be
taken
like
foxes
we
who
are
lions
and
thrown
into
some
dungeon
where
we
shall
not
even
have
the
consolation
of
seeing
this
frightful
gray
sky
of
rueil
which
no
more
resembles
the
sky
of
tarbes
than
the
moon
is
like
the
sun
if
we
only
had
some
one
to
instruct
us
about
the
physical
and
moral
topography
of
this
castle
ah
when
one
thinks
that
for
twenty
years
during
which
time
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
myself
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
come
to
study
what
difference
does
that
make
said
porthos
we
shall
go
out
all
the
do
you
know
my
dear
fellow
why
master
pastrycooks
never
work
with
their
hands
no
said
porthos
but
i
should
be
glad
to
be
it
is
because
in
the
presence
of
their
pupils
they
fear
that
some
of
their
tarts
or
creams
may
turn
out
badly
what
then
why
then
they
would
be
laughed
at
and
a
master
pastrycook
must
never
be
laughed
and
what
have
master
pastrycooks
to
do
with
us
we
ought
in
our
adventures
never
to
be
defeated
or
give
any
one
a
chance
to
laugh
at
us
in
england
lately
we
failed
we
were
beaten
and
that
is
a
blemish
on
our
by
whom
then
were
we
beaten
asked
porthos
by
yes
but
we
have
drowned
monsieur
that
is
true
and
that
will
redeem
us
a
little
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
if
posterity
ever
looks
at
us
but
listen
porthos
though
monsieur
mordaunt
was
a
man
not
to
be
despised
mazarin
is
not
less
strong
than
he
and
we
shall
not
easily
succeed
in
drowning
him
we
must
therefore
watch
and
play
a
close
game
for
he
added
with
a
sigh
we
two
are
equal
perhaps
to
eight
others
but
we
are
not
equal
to
the
four
that
you
know
that
is
true
said
porthos
echoing
d
artagnan
s
sigh
well
porthos
follow
my
examples
walk
back
and
forth
till
some
news
of
our
friends
reaches
us
or
till
we
are
visited
by
a
good
idea
but
don
t
sleep
as
you
do
all
the
time
nothing
dulls
the
intellect
like
sleep
as
to
what
may
lie
before
us
it
is
perhaps
less
serious
than
we
at
first
thought
i
don
t
believe
that
monsieur
de
mazarin
thinks
of
cutting
off
our
heads
for
heads
are
not
taken
off
without
previous
trial
a
trial
would
make
a
noise
and
a
noise
would
get
the
attention
of
our
friends
who
would
check
the
operations
of
monsieur
de
how
well
you
reason
said
porthos
admiringly
well
yes
pretty
well
replied
d
artagnan
and
besides
you
see
if
they
put
us
on
trial
if
they
cut
off
our
heads
they
must
meanwhile
either
keep
us
here
or
transfer
us
yes
that
is
inevitable
said
porthos
well
it
is
impossible
but
that
master
aramis
that
bloodhound
and
athos
that
wise
and
prudent
nobleman
will
discover
our
retreat
then
believe
me
it
will
be
time
to
yes
we
will
wait
we
can
wait
the
more
contentedly
that
it
is
not
absolutely
bad
here
but
for
one
thing
at
what
is
that
did
you
observe
d
artagnan
that
three
days
running
they
have
brought
us
braised
mutton
no
but
if
it
occurs
a
fourth
time
i
shall
complain
of
it
so
never
and
then
i
feel
the
loss
of
my
house
tis
a
long
time
since
i
visited
my
forget
them
for
a
time
we
shall
return
to
them
unless
mazarin
razes
them
to
the
do
you
think
that
likely
no
the
other
cardinal
would
have
done
so
but
this
one
is
too
mean
a
fellow
to
risk
you
reconcile
me
d
well
then
assume
a
cheerful
manner
as
i
do
we
must
joke
with
the
guards
we
must
gain
the
of
the
soldiers
since
we
can
t
corrupt
them
try
porthos
to
please
them
more
than
you
are
wont
to
do
when
they
are
under
our
windows
thus
far
you
have
done
nothing
but
show
them
your
fist
and
the
more
respectable
your
fist
is
porthos
the
less
attractive
it
is
ah
i
would
give
much
to
have
five
hundred
louis
so
would
i
said
porthos
unwilling
to
be
behind
d
artagnan
in
generosity
i
would
give
as
much
as
a
hundred
the
two
prisoners
were
at
this
point
of
their
conversation
when
comminges
entered
preceded
by
a
sergeant
and
two
men
who
brought
supper
in
a
basket
with
two
handles
filled
with
basins
and
plates
what
exclaimed
porthos
mutton
again
my
dear
monsieur
de
comminges
said
d
artagnan
you
will
find
that
my
friend
monsieur
du
vallon
will
go
to
the
most
fatal
lengths
if
cardinal
mazarin
continues
to
provide
us
with
this
sort
of
meat
mutton
every
i
declare
said
porthos
i
shall
eat
nothing
if
they
do
not
take
it
remove
the
mutton
cried
comminges
i
wish
monsieur
du
vallon
to
sup
well
more
especially
as
i
have
news
to
give
him
that
will
improve
his
is
mazarin
dead
asked
porthos
no
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
he
is
perfectly
so
much
the
worse
said
porthos
what
is
that
news
asked
d
artagnan
news
in
prison
is
a
fruit
so
rare
that
i
trust
monsieur
de
comminges
you
will
excuse
my
impatience
the
more
eager
since
you
have
given
us
to
understand
that
the
news
is
should
you
be
glad
to
hear
that
the
comte
de
la
fere
is
well
asked
de
comminges
d
artagnan
s
penetrating
gray
eyes
were
opened
to
the
utmost
glad
he
cried
i
should
be
more
than
glad
happy
beyond
measure
well
i
am
desired
by
him
to
give
you
his
compliments
and
to
say
that
he
is
in
good
d
artagnan
almost
leaped
with
joy
a
quick
glance
conveyed
his
thought
to
porthos
if
athos
knows
where
we
are
if
he
opens
communication
with
us
before
long
athos
will
porthos
was
not
very
quick
to
understand
the
language
of
glances
but
now
since
the
name
of
athos
had
suggested
to
him
the
same
idea
he
understood
do
you
say
asked
the
gascon
timidly
that
the
comte
de
la
fere
has
commissioned
you
to
give
his
compliments
to
monsieur
du
vallon
and
myself
yes
then
you
have
seen
him
certainly
i
where
if
i
may
ask
without
near
here
replied
de
comminges
smiling
so
near
that
if
the
windows
which
look
on
the
orangery
were
not
stopped
up
you
could
see
him
from
where
you
he
is
wandering
about
the
environs
of
the
castle
thought
d
artagnan
then
he
said
aloud
you
met
him
i
dare
say
in
the
park
hunting
perhaps
no
nearer
nearer
still
look
behind
this
wall
said
de
comminges
knocking
against
the
wall
behind
this
wall
what
is
there
then
behind
this
wall
i
was
brought
here
by
night
so
devil
take
me
if
i
know
where
i
well
said
comminges
suppose
one
i
will
suppose
anything
you
suppose
there
were
a
window
in
this
well
from
that
window
you
would
see
monsieur
de
la
fere
at
the
count
then
is
in
the
chateau
for
what
reason
the
same
as
athos
a
prisoner
you
know
well
replied
de
comminges
that
there
are
no
prisoners
at
rueil
because
there
is
no
don
t
let
us
play
upon
words
sir
athos
has
been
yesterday
at
saint
germain
as
he
came
out
from
the
presence
of
the
the
arms
of
d
artagnan
fell
powerless
by
his
side
one
might
have
supposed
him
thunderstruck
a
paleness
ran
like
a
cloud
over
his
dark
skin
but
disappeared
immediately
a
prisoner
he
reiterated
a
prisoner
repeated
porthos
quite
dejected
suddenly
d
artagnan
looked
up
and
in
his
eyes
there
was
a
gleam
which
scarcely
even
porthos
observed
but
it
died
away
and
he
appeared
more
sorrowful
than
before
come
come
said
comminges
who
since
d
artagnan
on
the
day
of
broussel
s
arrest
had
saved
him
from
the
hands
of
the
parisians
had
entertained
a
real
affection
for
him
don
t
be
unhappy
i
never
thought
of
bringing
you
bad
news
laugh
at
the
chance
which
has
brought
your
friend
near
to
you
and
monsieur
du
vallon
instead
of
being
in
the
depths
of
despair
about
but
d
artagnan
was
still
in
a
desponding
mood
and
how
did
he
look
asked
porthos
who
perceiving
that
d
artagnan
had
allowed
the
conversation
to
drop
profited
by
it
to
put
in
a
word
or
two
very
well
indeed
sir
replied
comminges
at
first
like
you
he
seemed
distressed
but
when
he
heard
that
the
cardinal
was
going
to
pay
him
a
visit
this
very
evening
ah
cried
d
artagnan
the
cardinal
is
about
to
visit
the
comte
de
la
fere
yes
and
the
count
desired
me
to
tell
you
that
he
should
take
advantage
of
this
visit
to
plead
for
you
and
for
ah
our
dear
count
said
d
artagnan
a
fine
thing
indeed
grunted
porthos
a
great
favor
zounds
monsieur
the
comte
de
la
fere
whose
family
is
allied
to
the
montmorency
and
the
rohan
is
easily
the
equal
of
monsieur
de
no
matter
said
d
artagnan
in
his
most
wheedling
tone
on
reflection
my
dear
du
vallon
it
is
a
great
honor
for
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
gives
good
reason
to
hope
in
fact
it
seems
to
me
so
great
an
honor
for
a
prisoner
that
i
think
monsieur
de
comminges
must
be
what
i
am
mistaken
monsieur
de
mazarin
will
not
come
to
visit
the
comte
de
la
fere
but
the
comte
de
la
fere
will
be
sent
for
to
visit
no
no
no
said
comminges
who
made
a
point
of
having
the
facts
appear
exactly
as
they
were
i
clearly
understood
what
the
cardinal
said
to
me
he
will
come
and
visit
the
comte
de
la
d
artagnan
tried
to
gather
from
the
expression
of
his
eyes
whether
porthos
understood
the
importance
of
that
visit
but
porthos
did
not
even
look
toward
him
it
is
then
the
cardinal
s
custom
to
walk
in
his
orangery
asked
d
artagnan
every
evening
he
shuts
himself
in
there
that
it
seems
is
where
he
meditates
on
state
in
that
case
said
d
artagnan
i
begin
to
believe
that
monsieur
de
la
fere
will
receive
the
visit
of
his
eminence
he
will
of
course
have
an
yes
two
and
will
he
talk
thus
of
affairs
in
presence
of
two
strangers
the
soldiers
are
swiss
who
understand
only
german
besides
according
to
all
probability
they
will
wait
at
the
d
artagnan
made
a
violent
effort
over
himself
to
keep
his
face
from
being
too
expressive
let
the
cardinal
take
care
of
going
alone
to
visit
the
comte
de
la
fere
said
d
artagnan
for
the
count
must
be
comminges
began
to
laugh
oh
oh
why
really
one
would
say
that
you
four
were
anthropaphagi
the
count
is
an
affable
man
besides
he
is
unarmed
at
the
first
word
from
his
eminence
the
two
soldiers
about
him
would
run
to
his
two
soldiers
said
d
artagnan
seeming
to
remember
something
two
soldiers
yes
that
then
is
why
i
hear
two
men
called
every
evening
and
see
them
walking
sometimes
for
half
an
hour
under
my
that
is
it
they
are
waiting
for
the
cardinal
or
rather
for
bernouin
who
comes
to
call
them
when
the
cardinal
goes
men
upon
my
word
said
d
artagnan
they
belong
to
the
regiment
that
was
at
lens
which
the
prince
assigned
to
the
ah
monsieur
said
d
artagnan
as
if
to
sum
up
in
a
word
all
that
conversation
if
only
his
eminence
would
relent
and
grant
to
monsieur
de
la
fere
our
i
wish
it
with
all
my
heart
said
comminges
then
if
he
should
forget
that
visit
you
would
find
no
inconvenience
in
reminding
him
of
it
not
at
ah
that
gives
me
more
this
skillful
turn
of
the
conversation
would
have
seemed
a
sublime
manoeuvre
to
any
one
who
could
have
read
the
gascon
s
soul
now
said
d
artagnan
i
ve
one
last
favor
to
ask
of
you
monsieur
de
at
your
service
you
will
see
the
count
again
will
you
remember
us
to
him
and
ask
him
to
solicit
for
me
the
same
favor
that
he
will
have
obtained
you
want
the
cardinal
to
come
here
no
i
know
my
place
and
am
not
so
presumptuous
let
his
eminence
do
me
the
honor
to
give
me
a
hearing
that
is
all
i
oh
muttered
porthos
shaking
his
head
never
should
i
have
thought
this
of
him
how
misfortune
humbles
a
man
i
promise
you
it
shall
be
done
answered
de
comminges
tell
the
count
that
i
am
well
that
you
found
me
sad
but
i
am
pleased
sir
to
hear
and
the
same
also
for
monsieur
du
vallon
not
for
me
cried
porthos
i
am
not
by
any
means
but
you
will
be
resigned
my
never
he
will
become
so
monsieur
i
know
him
better
than
he
knows
himself
be
silent
dear
du
vallon
and
resign
adieu
gentlemen
said
de
comminges
sleep
well
we
will
de
comminges
went
away
d
artagnan
remaining
apparently
in
the
same
attitude
of
humble
resignation
but
scarcely
had
he
departed
when
he
turned
and
clasped
porthos
in
his
arms
with
an
expression
not
to
be
doubted
oh
cried
porthos
what
s
the
matter
now
have
you
gone
mad
my
dear
friend
what
is
the
matter
returned
d
artagnan
we
are
saved
i
don
t
see
that
at
all
answered
porthos
i
think
we
are
all
taken
prisoners
except
aramis
and
that
our
chances
of
getting
out
are
lessened
since
one
more
of
us
is
caught
in
mazarin
s
which
is
far
too
strong
for
two
of
us
but
not
strong
enough
for
three
of
us
returned
d
artagnan
i
don
t
understand
said
porthos
never
mind
let
s
sit
down
to
table
and
take
something
to
strengthen
us
for
the
what
are
we
to
do
then
to
travel
but
sit
down
dear
friend
to
table
when
one
is
eating
ideas
flow
easily
after
supper
when
they
are
perfected
i
will
communicate
my
plans
to
so
porthos
sat
down
to
table
without
another
word
and
ate
with
an
appetite
that
did
honor
to
the
confidence
that
was
ever
inspired
in
him
by
d
artagnan
s
inventive
imagination
strength
and
sagacity
continued
supper
was
eaten
in
silence
but
not
in
sadness
for
from
time
to
time
one
of
those
sweet
smiles
which
were
habitual
to
him
in
moments
of
illumined
the
face
of
d
artagnan
not
a
scintilla
of
these
was
lost
on
porthos
and
at
every
one
he
uttered
an
exclamation
which
betrayed
to
his
friend
that
he
had
not
lost
sight
of
the
idea
which
possessed
his
brain
at
dessert
d
artagnan
reposed
in
his
chair
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
lounged
about
like
a
man
perfectly
at
his
ease
porthos
rested
his
chin
on
his
hands
placed
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
looked
at
d
artagnan
with
an
expression
of
confidence
which
imparted
to
that
colossus
an
admirable
appearance
of
well
said
d
artagnan
at
last
well
repeated
porthos
you
were
saying
my
dear
friend
no
i
said
yes
you
were
saying
you
wished
to
leave
this
ah
indeed
the
will
was
never
to
get
away
you
would
not
mind
you
added
knocking
down
a
door
or
a
tis
true
i
said
so
and
i
say
it
and
i
answered
you
porthos
that
it
was
not
a
good
plan
that
we
couldn
t
go
a
hundred
steps
without
being
recaptured
because
we
were
without
clothes
to
disguise
ourselves
and
arms
to
defend
that
is
true
we
should
need
clothes
and
well
said
d
artagnan
rising
we
have
them
friend
porthos
and
even
something
bah
said
porthos
looking
around
useless
to
look
everything
will
come
to
us
when
wanted
at
about
what
time
did
we
see
the
two
swiss
guards
walking
yesterday
an
hour
after
if
they
go
out
as
they
did
yesterday
we
shall
have
the
honor
then
of
seeing
them
in
half
an
hour
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
your
arm
is
still
strong
enough
is
it
not
porthos
porthos
unbuttoned
his
sleeve
raised
his
shirt
and
looked
complacently
on
his
strong
arm
as
large
as
the
leg
of
any
ordinary
man
yes
indeed
said
he
i
believe
so
that
you
could
without
trouble
convert
these
tongs
into
a
hoop
and
yonder
shovel
into
a
corkscrew
and
the
giant
took
up
these
two
articles
and
without
any
apparent
effort
produced
in
them
the
metamorphoses
suggested
by
his
companion
there
he
cried
capital
exclaimed
the
gascon
really
porthos
you
are
a
gifted
individual
i
have
heard
speak
said
porthos
of
a
certain
milo
of
crotona
who
performed
wonderful
feats
such
as
binding
his
forehead
with
a
cord
and
bursting
it
of
killing
an
ox
with
a
blow
of
his
fist
and
carrying
it
home
on
his
shoulders
et
cetera
i
used
to
learn
all
these
feat
by
heart
yonder
down
at
pierrefonds
and
i
have
done
all
that
he
did
except
breaking
a
cord
by
the
corrugation
of
my
because
your
strength
is
not
in
your
head
porthos
said
his
friend
no
it
is
in
my
arms
and
shoulders
answered
porthos
with
gratified
naivete
well
my
dear
friend
let
us
approach
the
window
and
there
you
can
match
your
strength
against
that
of
an
iron
porthos
went
to
the
window
took
a
bar
in
his
hands
clung
to
it
and
bent
it
like
a
bow
so
that
the
two
ends
came
out
of
the
sockets
of
stone
in
which
for
thirty
years
they
had
been
fixed
well
friend
the
cardinal
although
such
a
genius
could
never
have
done
shall
i
take
out
any
more
of
them
asked
porthos
no
that
is
sufficient
a
man
can
pass
through
porthos
tried
and
passed
the
upper
portion
of
his
body
through
yes
he
said
now
pass
your
arm
through
this
why
you
will
know
presently
pass
porthos
obeyed
with
military
promptness
and
passed
his
arm
through
the
opening
admirable
said
d
artagnan
the
scheme
goes
forward
it
on
wheels
dear
good
what
shall
i
do
now
it
is
finished
then
no
not
i
should
like
to
understand
said
porthos
listen
my
dear
friend
in
two
words
you
will
know
all
the
door
of
the
guardhouse
opens
as
you
yes
i
they
are
about
to
send
into
our
court
which
monsieur
de
mazarin
crosses
on
his
way
to
the
orangery
the
two
guards
who
attend
there
they
are
coming
if
only
they
close
the
guardhouse
door
good
they
close
what
then
silence
they
may
hear
i
don
t
understand
it
at
as
you
execute
you
will
and
yet
i
should
have
preferred
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
the
ah
that
is
hush
porthos
remained
silent
and
motionless
in
fact
the
two
soldiers
advanced
on
the
side
where
the
window
was
rubbing
their
hands
for
it
was
cold
it
being
the
month
of
february
at
this
moment
the
door
of
the
guardhouse
was
opened
and
one
of
the
soldiers
was
summoned
away
now
said
d
artagnan
i
am
going
to
call
this
soldier
and
talk
to
him
don
t
lose
a
word
of
what
i
m
going
to
say
to
you
porthos
everything
lies
in
the
good
the
execution
of
plots
is
my
i
know
it
well
i
depend
on
you
look
i
shall
turn
to
the
left
so
that
the
soldier
will
be
at
your
right
as
soon
as
he
mounts
on
the
bench
to
talk
to
but
supposing
he
doesn
t
mount
he
will
rely
upon
it
as
soon
as
you
see
him
get
up
stretch
out
your
arm
and
seize
him
by
the
neck
then
raising
him
up
as
tobit
raised
the
fish
by
the
gills
you
must
pull
him
into
the
room
taking
care
to
squeeze
him
so
tight
that
he
can
t
cry
oh
said
porthos
suppose
i
happen
to
strangle
him
to
be
sure
there
would
only
be
a
swiss
the
less
in
the
world
but
you
will
not
do
so
i
hope
lay
him
down
here
we
ll
gag
him
and
tie
him
no
matter
where
somewhere
so
we
shall
get
from
him
one
uniform
and
a
marvelous
exclaimed
porthos
looking
at
the
gascon
with
the
most
profound
admiration
pooh
replied
d
artagnan
yes
said
porthos
recollecting
himself
but
one
uniform
and
one
sword
will
not
suffice
for
well
but
there
s
his
true
said
porthos
therefore
when
i
cough
stretch
out
your
good
the
two
friends
then
placed
themselves
as
they
had
agreed
porthos
being
completely
hidden
in
an
angle
of
the
window
comrade
said
d
artagnan
in
his
most
fascinating
voice
and
manner
sir
answered
the
soldier
in
a
strong
provincial
accent
tis
not
too
warm
to
walk
resumed
d
artagnan
no
and
i
think
a
glass
of
wine
will
not
be
disagreeable
to
you
a
glass
of
wine
will
be
extremely
the
fish
bites
the
fish
bites
whispered
the
gascon
to
porthos
i
understand
said
porthos
a
bottle
perhaps
a
whole
bottle
yes
a
whole
bottle
if
you
will
drink
my
willingly
answered
the
soldier
come
then
and
take
it
friend
said
the
gascon
with
all
my
heart
how
convenient
that
there
s
a
bench
here
egad
one
would
think
it
had
been
placed
here
on
get
on
it
that
s
it
and
d
artagnan
coughed
that
instant
the
arm
of
porthos
fell
his
hand
of
iron
grasped
quick
as
lightning
firm
as
a
pair
of
blacksmith
s
pincers
the
soldier
s
throat
he
raised
him
almost
stifling
him
as
he
drew
him
through
the
aperture
at
the
risk
of
flaying
him
in
the
passage
he
then
laid
him
down
on
the
floor
where
d
artagnan
after
giving
him
just
time
enough
to
draw
his
breath
gagged
him
with
his
long
scarf
and
the
moment
he
had
done
so
began
to
undress
him
with
the
promptitude
and
dexterity
of
a
man
who
had
learned
his
business
on
the
field
of
battle
then
the
soldier
gagged
and
bound
was
placed
upon
the
hearth
the
fire
of
which
had
been
previously
extinguished
by
the
two
friends
here
s
a
sword
and
a
dress
said
porthos
i
take
them
said
d
artagnan
for
myself
if
you
want
another
uniform
and
sword
you
must
play
the
same
trick
over
again
stop
i
see
the
other
soldier
issue
from
the
guardroom
and
come
toward
i
think
replied
porthos
it
would
be
imprudent
to
attempt
the
same
manoeuvre
again
it
is
said
that
no
man
can
succeed
twice
in
the
same
way
and
a
failure
would
be
ruinous
no
i
will
go
down
seize
the
man
unawares
and
bring
him
to
you
ready
that
is
better
said
the
gascon
be
ready
said
porthos
as
he
slipped
through
the
opening
he
did
as
he
said
porthos
seized
his
opportunity
caught
the
next
soldier
by
his
neck
gagged
him
and
pushed
him
like
a
mummy
through
the
bars
into
the
room
and
entered
after
him
then
they
undressed
him
as
they
had
done
the
first
laid
him
on
their
bed
and
bound
him
with
the
straps
which
composed
the
bed
the
bedstead
being
of
oak
this
operation
proved
as
great
a
success
as
the
first
there
said
d
artagnan
this
is
capital
now
let
me
try
on
the
dress
of
yonder
chap
porthos
i
doubt
if
you
can
wear
it
but
should
it
be
too
tight
never
mind
you
can
wear
the
breastplate
and
the
hat
with
the
red
it
happened
however
that
the
second
soldier
was
a
swiss
of
gigantic
proportions
so
save
that
some
few
of
the
seams
split
his
uniform
fitted
porthos
perfectly
they
then
dressed
themselves
tis
done
they
both
exclaimed
at
once
as
to
you
comrades
they
said
to
the
men
nothing
will
happen
to
you
if
you
are
discreet
but
if
you
stir
you
are
dead
the
soldiers
were
complaisant
they
had
found
the
grasp
of
porthos
pretty
powerful
and
that
it
was
no
joke
to
fight
against
it
now
said
d
artagnan
you
wouldn
t
be
sorry
to
understand
the
plot
would
you
porthos
well
no
not
well
then
we
shall
go
down
into
the
we
shall
take
the
place
of
those
two
well
we
will
walk
back
and
that
s
a
good
idea
for
it
isn
t
in
a
moment
the
will
call
the
guard
as
he
did
yesterday
and
the
day
and
we
shall
answer
no
on
the
contrary
we
shall
not
as
you
please
i
don
t
insist
on
we
will
not
answer
then
we
will
simply
settle
our
hats
on
our
heads
and
we
will
escort
his
where
shall
we
escort
him
where
he
is
going
to
visit
athos
do
you
think
athos
will
be
sorry
to
see
us
oh
cried
porthos
oh
i
wait
a
little
porthos
before
crying
out
for
on
my
word
you
haven
t
reached
the
end
said
the
gascon
in
a
jesting
tone
what
is
to
happen
said
porthos
follow
me
replied
d
artagnan
the
man
who
lives
to
see
shall
and
slipping
through
the
aperture
he
alighted
in
the
court
porthos
followed
him
by
the
same
road
but
with
more
difficulty
and
less
diligence
they
could
hear
the
two
soldiers
shivering
with
fear
as
they
lay
bound
in
the
chamber
scarcely
had
the
two
frenchmen
touched
the
ground
when
a
door
opened
and
the
voice
of
the
called
out
make
ready
at
the
same
moment
the
guardhouse
was
opened
and
a
voice
called
out
la
bruyere
and
du
barthois
march
it
seems
that
i
am
named
la
bruyere
remarked
d
artagnan
and
i
du
barthois
added
porthos
where
are
you
asked
the
whose
eyes
dazzled
by
the
light
could
not
clearly
distinguish
our
heroes
in
the
gloom
here
we
are
said
the
gascon
what
say
you
to
that
monsieur
du
vallon
he
added
in
a
low
tone
to
porthos
if
it
but
lasts
most
capital
responded
porthos
these
two
newly
enlisted
soldiers
marched
gravely
after
the
who
opened
the
door
of
the
vestibule
then
another
which
seemed
to
be
that
of
a
and
showing
them
two
stools
your
orders
are
very
simple
he
said
don
t
allow
anybody
except
one
person
to
enter
here
do
you
hear
not
a
single
creature
obey
that
person
implicitly
on
your
return
you
can
not
make
a
mistake
you
have
only
to
wait
here
till
i
release
d
artagnan
was
known
to
this
who
was
no
other
than
bernouin
and
he
had
during
the
last
six
or
eight
months
introduced
the
gascon
a
dozen
times
to
the
cardinal
the
gascon
therefore
instead
of
answering
growled
out
ja
ja
in
the
most
german
and
the
least
gascon
accent
possible
as
for
porthos
on
whom
d
artagnan
had
impressed
the
necessity
of
absolute
silence
and
who
did
not
even
now
begin
to
comprehend
the
scheme
of
his
friend
which
was
to
follow
mazarin
in
his
visit
to
athos
he
was
simply
mute
all
that
he
was
allowed
to
say
in
case
of
emergencies
was
the
proverbial
der
teufel
bernouin
shut
the
door
and
went
away
when
porthos
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
he
began
to
be
alarmed
lest
they
should
only
have
exchanged
one
prison
for
another
porthos
my
friend
said
d
artagnan
don
t
distrust
providence
let
me
meditate
and
meditate
and
consider
as
much
as
you
like
replied
porthos
who
was
now
quite
out
of
humor
at
seeing
things
take
this
turn
we
have
walked
eight
paces
whispered
d
artagnan
and
gone
up
six
steps
so
hereabouts
is
the
pavilion
called
the
pavilion
of
the
orangery
the
comte
de
la
fere
can
not
be
far
off
only
the
doors
are
that
is
a
slight
difficulty
said
porthos
and
a
good
push
with
the
shoulders
for
god
s
sake
porthos
my
friend
reserve
your
feats
of
strength
or
they
will
not
have
when
needed
the
honor
they
deserve
have
you
not
heard
that
some
one
is
coming
here
well
that
some
one
will
open
the
but
my
dear
fellow
if
that
some
one
recognizes
us
if
that
some
one
cries
out
we
are
lost
for
you
don
t
propose
i
imagine
that
i
shall
kill
that
man
of
the
church
that
might
do
if
we
were
dealing
with
englishmen
or
oh
may
god
keep
me
from
it
and
you
too
said
d
artagnan
the
young
king
would
perhaps
show
us
some
gratitude
but
the
queen
would
never
forgive
us
and
it
is
she
whom
we
have
to
consider
and
then
besides
the
useless
blood
never
no
never
i
have
my
plan
let
me
carry
it
out
and
we
shall
so
much
the
better
said
porthos
i
feel
some
need
of
hush
said
d
artagnan
the
some
one
is
the
sound
of
a
light
step
was
heard
in
the
vestibule
the
hinges
of
the
door
creaked
and
a
man
appeared
in
the
dress
of
a
cavalier
wrapped
in
a
brown
cloak
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
and
a
large
beaver
hat
pulled
down
over
his
eyes
porthos
effaced
himself
against
the
wall
but
he
could
not
render
himself
invisible
and
the
man
in
the
cloak
said
to
him
giving
him
his
lantern
light
the
lamp
which
hangs
from
the
then
addressing
d
artagnan
you
know
the
watchword
he
said
ja
replied
the
gascon
determined
to
confine
himself
to
this
specimen
of
the
german
tongue
tedesco
answered
the
cavalier
va
and
advancing
toward
the
door
opposite
to
that
by
which
he
came
in
he
opened
it
and
disappeared
behind
it
shutting
it
as
he
went
now
asked
porthos
what
are
we
to
do
now
we
shall
make
use
of
your
shoulder
friend
porthos
if
this
door
proves
to
be
locked
everything
in
its
proper
time
and
all
comes
right
to
those
who
know
how
to
wait
patiently
but
first
barricade
the
first
door
well
then
we
will
follow
yonder
the
two
friends
set
to
work
and
crowded
the
space
before
the
door
with
all
the
furniture
in
the
room
as
not
only
to
make
the
passage
impassable
but
so
to
block
the
door
that
by
no
means
could
it
open
inward
there
said
d
artagnan
we
can
t
be
overtaken
come
forward
the
oubliettes
of
cardinal
mazarin
at
first
on
arriving
at
the
door
through
which
mazarin
had
passed
d
artagnan
tried
in
vain
to
open
it
but
on
the
powerful
shoulder
of
porthos
being
applied
to
one
of
the
panels
which
gave
way
d
artagnan
introduced
the
point
of
his
sword
between
the
bolt
and
the
staple
of
the
lock
the
bolt
gave
way
and
the
door
opened
as
i
told
you
everything
can
be
attained
porthos
women
and
doors
by
proceeding
with
you
re
a
great
moralist
and
that
s
the
fact
said
porthos
they
entered
behind
a
glass
window
by
the
light
of
the
cardinal
s
lantern
which
had
been
placed
on
the
floor
in
the
midst
of
the
gallery
they
saw
the
orange
and
pomegranate
trees
of
the
castle
of
rueil
in
long
lines
forming
one
great
alley
and
two
smaller
side
alleys
no
cardinal
said
d
artagnan
but
only
his
lantern
where
the
devil
then
is
he
exploring
however
one
of
the
side
wings
of
the
gallery
after
making
a
sign
to
porthos
to
explore
the
other
he
saw
all
at
once
at
his
left
a
tub
containing
an
orange
tree
which
had
been
pushed
out
of
its
place
and
in
its
place
an
open
aperture
ten
men
would
have
found
difficulty
in
moving
that
tub
but
by
some
mechanical
contrivance
it
had
turned
with
the
flagstone
on
which
it
rested
d
artagnan
as
we
have
said
perceived
a
hole
in
that
place
and
in
this
hole
the
steps
of
a
winding
staircase
he
called
porthos
to
look
at
it
were
our
object
money
only
he
said
we
should
be
rich
how
s
that
don
t
you
understand
porthos
at
the
bottom
of
that
staircase
lies
probably
the
cardinal
s
treasury
of
which
folk
tell
such
wonders
and
we
should
only
have
to
descend
empty
a
chest
shut
the
cardinal
up
in
it
double
lock
it
go
away
carrying
off
as
much
gold
as
we
could
put
back
this
over
the
place
and
no
one
in
the
world
would
ever
ask
us
where
our
fortune
came
from
not
even
the
it
would
be
a
happy
hit
for
clowns
to
make
but
as
it
seems
to
be
unworthy
of
two
gentlemen
said
porthos
so
i
think
and
therefore
i
said
were
our
object
money
only
but
we
want
something
else
replied
the
gascon
at
the
same
moment
whilst
d
artagnan
was
leaning
over
the
aperture
to
listen
a
metallic
sound
as
if
some
one
was
moving
a
bag
of
gold
struck
on
his
ear
he
started
instantly
afterward
a
door
opened
and
a
light
played
upon
the
staircase
mazarin
had
left
his
lamp
in
the
gallery
to
make
people
believe
that
he
was
walking
about
but
he
had
with
him
a
waxlight
to
help
him
to
explore
his
mysterious
strong
box
faith
he
said
in
italian
as
he
was
reascending
the
steps
and
looking
at
a
bag
of
reals
faith
there
s
enough
to
pay
five
councillors
of
parliament
and
two
generals
in
paris
i
am
a
great
captain
that
i
am
but
i
make
war
in
my
own
the
two
friends
were
crouching
down
meantime
behind
a
tub
in
the
side
alley
mazarin
came
within
three
steps
of
d
artagnan
and
pushed
a
spring
in
the
wall
the
slab
turned
and
the
orange
tree
resumed
its
place
then
the
cardinal
put
out
the
waxlight
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
and
taking
up
the
lantern
now
he
said
for
monsieur
de
la
very
good
thought
d
artagnan
tis
our
road
likewise
we
will
go
all
three
set
off
on
their
walk
mazarin
taking
the
middle
alley
and
the
friends
the
side
ones
the
cardinal
reached
a
second
door
without
perceiving
he
was
being
followed
the
sand
with
which
the
alleys
were
covered
deadened
the
sound
of
footsteps
he
then
turned
to
the
left
down
a
corridor
which
had
escaped
the
attention
of
the
two
friends
but
as
he
opened
the
door
he
paused
as
if
in
thought
ah
diavolo
he
exclaimed
i
forgot
the
recommendation
of
de
comminges
who
advised
me
to
take
a
guard
and
place
it
at
this
door
in
order
not
to
put
myself
at
the
mercy
of
that
combination
of
and
with
a
movement
of
impatience
he
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
do
not
give
yourself
the
trouble
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
with
his
right
foot
forward
his
beaver
in
his
hand
a
smile
on
his
face
we
have
followed
your
eminence
step
by
step
and
here
we
yes
here
we
are
said
porthos
and
he
made
the
same
friendly
salute
as
d
artagnan
mazarin
gazed
at
each
of
them
with
an
affrighted
stare
recognized
them
and
let
drop
his
lantern
uttering
a
cry
of
terror
d
artagnan
picked
it
up
by
good
luck
it
had
not
been
extinguished
oh
what
imprudence
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
tis
not
good
to
be
about
just
here
without
a
light
your
eminence
might
knock
against
something
or
fall
into
a
monsieur
d
artagnan
muttered
mazarin
unable
to
recover
from
his
astonishment
yes
my
lord
it
is
i
have
the
honor
to
present
to
you
monsieur
du
vallon
that
excellent
friend
of
mine
in
whom
your
eminence
had
the
kindness
to
interest
yourself
and
d
artagnan
held
the
lamp
before
the
merry
face
of
porthos
who
now
began
to
comprehend
the
affair
and
be
very
proud
of
the
whole
undertaking
you
were
going
to
visit
monsieur
de
la
fere
said
d
artagnan
don
t
let
us
disarrange
your
eminence
be
so
good
as
to
show
us
the
way
and
we
will
follow
mazarin
was
by
degrees
recovering
his
senses
have
you
been
long
in
the
orangery
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
remembering
the
visits
he
had
been
paying
to
his
treasury
porthos
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
d
artagnan
made
him
a
sign
and
his
mouth
remaining
silent
gradually
closed
this
moment
come
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
mazarin
breathed
again
his
fears
were
now
no
longer
for
his
hoard
but
for
himself
a
sort
of
smile
played
on
his
lips
come
he
said
you
have
me
in
a
snare
gentlemen
i
confess
myself
conquered
you
wish
to
ask
for
liberty
and
i
give
it
oh
my
lord
answered
d
artagnan
you
are
too
good
as
to
our
liberty
we
have
that
we
want
to
ask
something
else
of
you
have
your
liberty
repeated
mazarin
in
terror
certainly
and
on
the
other
hand
my
lord
you
have
lost
it
and
now
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
war
sir
you
must
buy
it
back
mazarin
felt
a
shiver
run
through
him
a
chill
even
to
his
heart
s
core
his
piercing
look
was
fixed
in
vain
on
the
satirical
face
of
the
gascon
and
the
unchanging
countenance
of
porthos
both
were
in
shadow
and
the
sybil
of
cuma
herself
could
not
have
read
them
to
purchase
back
my
liberty
said
the
cardinal
yes
my
and
how
much
will
that
cost
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
zounds
my
lord
i
don
t
know
yet
we
must
ask
the
comte
de
la
fere
the
question
will
your
eminence
deign
to
open
the
door
which
leads
to
the
count
s
room
and
in
ten
minutes
all
will
be
mazarin
started
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
your
eminence
sees
that
we
wish
to
act
with
all
formality
and
due
respect
but
i
must
warn
you
that
we
have
no
time
to
lose
open
the
door
then
my
lord
and
be
so
good
as
to
remember
once
for
all
that
on
the
slightest
attempt
to
escape
or
the
faintest
cry
for
help
our
position
being
very
critical
indeed
you
must
not
be
angry
with
us
if
we
go
to
be
assured
answered
mazarin
that
i
shall
attempt
nothing
i
give
you
my
word
of
d
artagnan
made
a
sign
to
porthos
to
redouble
his
watchfulness
then
turning
to
mazarin
now
my
lord
let
us
enter
if
you
conferences
mazarin
turned
the
lock
of
a
double
door
on
the
threshold
of
which
they
found
athos
ready
to
receive
his
illustrious
guests
according
to
the
notice
comminges
had
given
him
on
perceiving
mazarin
he
bowed
your
eminence
he
said
might
have
dispensed
with
your
attendants
the
honor
bestowed
on
me
is
too
great
for
me
to
be
unmindful
of
and
so
my
dear
count
said
d
artagnan
his
eminence
didn
t
actually
insist
on
our
attending
him
it
is
du
vallon
and
i
who
have
insisted
and
even
in
a
manner
somewhat
impolite
perhaps
so
great
was
our
longing
to
see
at
that
voice
that
mocking
tone
and
that
familiar
gesture
accenting
voice
and
tone
athos
made
a
bound
of
surprise
d
artagnan
porthos
he
exclaimed
my
very
self
dear
me
also
repeated
porthos
what
means
this
asked
the
count
it
means
replied
mazarin
trying
to
smile
and
biting
his
lips
in
the
attempt
that
our
parts
are
changed
and
that
instead
of
these
gentlemen
being
my
prisoners
i
am
theirs
but
gentlemen
i
warn
you
unless
you
kill
me
your
victory
will
be
of
very
short
duration
people
will
come
to
the
ah
my
lord
cried
the
gascon
don
t
threaten
tis
a
bad
example
we
are
so
good
and
gentle
to
your
eminence
come
let
us
put
aside
all
rancor
and
talk
there
s
nothing
i
wish
more
replied
mazarin
but
don
t
think
yourselves
in
a
better
position
than
you
are
in
ensnaring
me
you
have
fallen
into
the
trap
yourselves
how
are
you
to
get
away
from
here
remember
the
soldiers
and
sentinels
who
guard
these
doors
now
i
am
going
to
show
you
how
sincere
i
good
thought
d
artagnan
we
must
look
about
us
he
s
going
to
play
us
a
i
offered
you
your
liberty
continued
the
minister
will
you
take
it
before
an
hour
has
passed
you
will
be
discovered
arrested
obliged
to
kill
me
which
would
be
a
crime
unworthy
of
loyal
gentlemen
like
he
is
right
thought
athos
and
like
every
other
reflection
passing
in
a
mind
that
entertained
none
but
noble
thoughts
this
feeling
was
expressed
in
his
eyes
and
therefore
said
d
artagnan
to
clip
the
hope
which
athos
s
tacit
adhesion
had
imparted
to
mazarin
we
shall
not
proceed
to
that
violence
save
in
the
last
if
on
the
contrary
resumed
mazarin
you
accept
your
liberty
why
you
my
lord
might
take
it
away
from
us
in
less
than
five
minutes
afterward
and
from
my
knowledge
of
you
i
believe
you
will
so
take
it
away
from
no
on
the
faith
of
a
cardinal
you
do
not
believe
me
my
lord
i
never
believe
cardinals
who
are
not
well
on
the
faith
of
a
you
are
no
longer
a
minister
my
lord
you
are
a
then
on
the
honor
of
a
mazarin
as
i
am
and
ever
shall
be
i
hope
said
the
cardinal
hem
replied
d
artagnan
i
have
heard
speak
of
a
mazarin
who
had
not
much
religion
when
his
oaths
were
in
question
i
fear
he
may
have
been
an
ancestor
of
your
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
are
a
great
wit
and
i
am
really
sorry
to
be
on
bad
terms
with
my
lord
let
us
come
to
terms
i
ask
nothing
very
well
said
mazarin
if
i
place
you
in
security
in
a
manner
evident
palpable
ah
that
is
another
thing
said
porthos
let
us
see
said
athos
let
us
see
said
d
artagnan
in
the
first
place
do
you
accept
asked
the
cardinal
unfold
your
plan
my
lord
and
we
will
take
notice
that
you
are
shut
up
you
well
know
my
lord
that
there
always
remains
to
us
a
last
what
that
of
dying
mazarin
shuddered
listen
he
said
at
the
end
of
yonder
corridor
is
a
door
of
which
i
have
the
key
it
leads
into
the
park
go
and
take
this
key
with
you
you
are
active
vigorous
and
you
have
arms
at
a
hundred
steps
on
turning
to
the
left
you
will
find
the
wall
of
the
park
get
over
it
and
in
three
leaps
you
will
be
on
the
road
and
ah
by
jove
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
you
have
well
said
but
these
are
only
words
where
is
the
key
you
speak
of
here
it
ah
my
lord
you
will
conduct
us
yourself
then
to
that
door
very
willingly
if
it
be
necessary
to
reassure
you
answered
the
minister
and
mazarin
who
was
delighted
to
get
off
so
cheaply
led
the
way
in
high
spirits
to
the
corridor
and
opened
the
door
it
led
into
the
park
as
the
three
fugitives
perceived
by
the
night
breeze
which
rushed
into
the
corridor
and
blew
the
wind
into
their
faces
the
devil
exclaimed
the
gascon
tis
a
dreadful
night
my
lord
we
don
t
know
the
locality
and
shall
never
find
the
wall
since
your
eminence
has
come
so
far
come
a
few
steps
further
conduct
us
my
lord
to
the
be
it
so
replied
the
cardinal
and
walking
in
a
straight
line
he
went
to
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
which
they
all
four
arrived
at
the
same
instant
are
you
satisfied
gentlemen
asked
mazarin
i
think
so
indeed
we
should
be
hard
to
please
if
we
were
not
deuce
take
it
three
poor
gentlemen
escorted
by
a
prince
of
the
church
ah
apropos
my
lord
you
remarked
that
we
were
all
active
vigorous
and
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
du
vallon
and
i
are
the
only
two
who
are
armed
the
count
is
not
and
should
we
meet
with
one
of
your
patrol
we
must
defend
tis
where
can
we
find
another
sword
asked
porthos
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
will
lend
his
which
is
of
no
use
to
him
to
the
comte
de
la
willingly
said
the
cardinal
i
will
even
ask
the
count
to
keep
it
for
my
i
promise
you
my
lord
never
to
part
with
it
replied
athos
well
well
cried
d
artagnan
this
reconciliation
is
truly
touching
have
you
not
tears
in
your
eyes
porthos
yes
said
porthos
but
i
do
not
know
if
it
is
feeling
or
the
wind
that
makes
me
weep
i
think
it
is
the
now
climb
up
athos
quickly
said
d
artagnan
athos
assisted
by
porthos
who
lifted
him
up
like
a
feather
arrived
at
the
top
now
jump
down
athos
jumped
and
disappeared
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
are
you
on
the
ground
asked
d
artagnan
without
accident
perfectly
safe
and
porthos
whilst
i
get
up
watch
the
cardinal
no
i
don
t
want
your
help
watch
the
i
am
watching
said
porthos
well
you
are
right
it
is
more
difficult
than
i
thought
lend
me
your
back
but
don
t
let
the
cardinal
porthos
lent
him
his
back
and
d
artagnan
was
soon
on
the
summit
of
the
wall
where
he
seated
himself
mazarin
pretended
to
laugh
are
you
there
asked
porthos
yes
my
friend
and
now
now
what
asked
porthos
now
give
me
the
cardinal
up
here
if
he
makes
any
noise
stifle
mazarin
wished
to
call
out
but
porthos
held
him
tight
and
passed
him
to
d
artagnan
who
seized
him
by
the
neck
and
made
him
sit
down
by
him
then
in
a
menacing
tone
he
said
sir
jump
directly
down
close
to
monsieur
de
la
fere
or
on
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
i
ll
kill
you
monsieur
monsieur
cried
mazarin
you
are
breaking
your
word
to
me
i
did
i
promise
you
anything
my
lord
mazarin
groaned
you
are
free
he
said
through
me
your
liberty
was
my
agreed
but
the
ransom
of
that
immense
treasure
buried
under
the
gallery
to
which
one
descends
on
pushing
a
spring
hidden
in
the
wall
which
causes
a
tub
to
turn
revealing
a
staircase
must
not
one
speak
of
that
a
little
my
lord
diavolo
cried
mazarin
almost
choked
and
clasping
his
hands
i
am
a
lost
and
ruined
man
but
without
listening
to
his
protestations
of
alarm
d
artagnan
slipped
him
gently
down
into
the
arms
of
athos
who
stood
immovable
at
the
bottom
of
the
wall
porthos
next
made
an
effort
which
shook
the
solid
wall
and
by
the
aid
of
his
friend
s
hand
gained
the
summit
i
didn
t
understand
it
all
he
said
but
i
understand
now
how
droll
it
is
you
think
so
so
much
the
better
but
that
it
may
prove
even
to
the
end
let
us
not
lose
and
he
jumped
off
the
wall
porthos
did
the
same
attend
to
monsieur
le
cardinal
gentlemen
said
d
artagnan
for
myself
i
will
the
gascon
then
drew
his
sword
and
marched
as
avant
guard
my
lord
he
said
which
way
do
we
go
think
well
of
your
reply
for
should
your
eminence
be
mistaken
there
might
ensue
most
grave
results
for
all
of
along
the
wall
sir
said
mazarin
there
will
be
no
danger
of
losing
the
three
friends
hastened
on
but
in
a
short
time
were
obliged
to
slacken
the
pace
the
cardinal
could
not
keep
up
with
them
though
with
every
wish
to
do
so
suddenly
d
artagnan
touched
something
warm
which
moved
stop
a
horse
he
cried
i
have
found
a
horse
and
i
likewise
said
athos
i
too
said
porthos
who
faithful
to
the
instructions
still
held
the
cardinal
s
arm
there
s
luck
my
lord
just
as
you
were
complaining
of
being
tired
and
obliged
to
but
as
he
spoke
the
barrel
of
a
pistol
was
presented
at
his
breast
and
these
words
were
pronounced
touch
it
not
grimaud
he
cried
grimaud
what
art
thou
about
why
thou
art
posted
here
by
heaven
no
sir
said
the
honest
servant
it
was
monsieur
aramis
who
posted
me
here
to
take
care
of
the
is
aramis
here
yes
sir
he
has
been
here
since
what
are
you
doing
on
the
watch
what
aramis
here
cried
athos
at
the
lesser
gate
of
the
castle
he
s
posted
are
you
a
large
party
let
him
this
moment
and
believing
that
no
one
could
execute
the
commission
better
than
himself
grimaud
set
off
at
full
speed
whilst
enchanted
at
being
all
together
again
the
friends
awaited
his
return
there
was
no
one
in
the
whole
group
in
a
bad
humor
except
cardinal
mazarin
thinking
that
porthos
will
be
at
last
a
baron
and
d
artagnan
a
captain
at
the
expiration
of
ten
minutes
aramis
arrived
accompanied
by
grimaud
and
eight
or
ten
followers
he
was
excessively
delighted
and
threw
himself
into
his
friends
arms
you
are
free
my
brothers
free
without
my
aid
and
i
shall
have
succeeded
in
doing
nothing
for
you
in
spite
of
all
my
do
not
be
unhappy
dear
friend
on
that
account
if
you
have
done
nothing
as
yet
you
will
do
something
soon
replied
athos
i
had
well
concerted
my
plans
pursued
aramis
the
coadjutor
gave
me
sixty
men
twenty
guard
the
walls
of
the
park
twenty
the
road
from
rueil
to
saint
germain
twenty
are
dispersed
in
the
woods
thus
i
was
able
thanks
to
the
strategic
disposition
of
my
forces
to
intercept
two
couriers
from
mazarin
to
the
mazarin
listened
intently
but
said
d
artagnan
i
trust
that
you
honorably
sent
them
back
to
monsieur
le
cardinal
ah
yes
said
aramis
toward
him
i
should
be
very
likely
to
practice
such
delicacy
of
sentiment
in
one
of
the
despatches
the
cardinal
declares
to
the
queen
that
the
treasury
is
empty
and
that
her
majesty
has
no
more
money
in
the
other
he
announces
that
he
is
about
to
transport
his
prisoners
to
melun
since
rueil
seemed
to
him
not
sufficiently
secure
you
can
understand
dear
friend
with
what
hope
i
was
inspired
by
that
last
letter
i
placed
myself
in
ambuscade
with
my
sixty
men
i
encircled
the
castle
the
riding
horses
i
entrusted
to
grimaud
and
i
awaited
your
coming
out
which
i
did
not
expect
till
and
i
didn
t
hope
to
free
you
without
a
skirmish
you
are
free
without
fighting
so
much
the
better
how
did
you
manage
to
escape
that
scoundrel
mazarin
you
must
have
much
reason
to
complain
of
not
very
much
said
d
artagnan
really
i
might
even
say
that
we
have
some
reason
to
praise
impossible
yes
really
it
is
owing
to
him
that
we
are
owing
to
him
yes
he
had
us
conducted
into
the
orangery
by
monsieur
bernouin
his
and
from
there
we
followed
him
to
visit
the
comte
de
la
fere
then
he
offered
us
our
liberty
and
we
accepted
it
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
show
us
the
way
out
he
led
us
to
the
park
wall
which
we
climbed
over
without
accident
and
then
we
fell
in
with
well
exclaimed
aramis
this
will
reconcile
me
to
him
but
i
wish
he
were
here
that
i
might
tell
him
that
i
did
not
believe
him
capable
of
so
noble
an
my
lord
said
d
artagnan
no
longer
able
to
contain
himself
allow
me
to
introduce
to
you
the
chevalier
d
herblay
who
wishes
as
you
may
have
heard
to
offer
his
congratulations
to
your
and
he
retired
discovering
mazarin
who
was
in
great
confusion
to
the
astonished
gaze
of
aramis
ho
ho
exclaimed
the
latter
the
cardinal
a
glorious
prize
halloo
halloo
friends
to
horse
to
horse
several
horsemen
ran
quickly
to
him
zounds
cried
aramis
i
may
have
done
some
good
so
my
lord
deign
to
receive
my
most
respectful
homage
i
will
lay
a
wager
that
twas
that
saint
christopher
porthos
who
performed
this
feat
apropos
i
forgot
and
he
gave
some
orders
in
a
low
voice
to
one
of
the
horsemen
i
think
it
will
be
wise
to
set
off
said
d
artagnan
yes
but
i
am
expecting
some
one
a
friend
of
a
friend
exclaimed
the
count
and
here
he
comes
by
jupiter
galloping
through
the
the
count
the
count
cried
a
young
voice
that
made
athos
start
raoul
raoul
he
ejaculated
for
one
moment
the
young
man
forgot
his
habitual
respect
he
threw
himself
on
his
father
s
neck
look
my
lord
cardinal
said
aramis
would
it
not
have
been
a
pity
to
have
separated
men
who
love
each
other
as
we
love
gentlemen
he
continued
addressing
the
cavaliers
who
became
more
and
more
numerous
every
instant
gentlemen
encircle
his
eminence
that
you
may
show
him
the
greater
honor
he
will
indeed
give
us
the
favor
of
his
company
you
will
i
hope
be
grateful
for
it
porthos
do
not
lose
sight
of
his
aramis
then
joined
athos
and
d
artagnan
who
were
consulting
together
come
said
d
artagnan
after
a
conference
of
five
minutes
duration
let
us
begin
our
where
are
we
to
go
asked
porthos
to
your
house
dear
porthos
at
pierrefonds
your
fine
chateau
is
worthy
of
affording
its
princely
hospitality
to
his
eminence
it
is
likewise
well
situated
neither
too
near
paris
nor
too
far
from
it
we
can
establish
a
communication
between
it
and
the
capital
with
great
facility
come
my
lord
you
shall
be
treated
like
a
prince
as
you
a
fallen
prince
exclaimed
mazarin
piteously
the
chances
of
war
said
athos
are
many
but
be
assured
we
shall
take
no
improper
advantage
of
no
but
we
shall
make
use
of
them
said
d
artagnan
the
rest
of
the
night
was
employed
by
these
cavaliers
in
traveling
with
the
wonderful
rapidity
of
former
days
mazarin
still
sombre
and
pensive
permitted
himself
to
be
dragged
along
in
this
way
it
looked
a
race
of
phantoms
at
dawn
twelve
leagues
had
been
passed
without
drawing
rein
half
the
escort
were
exhausted
and
several
horses
fell
down
horses
nowadays
are
not
what
they
were
formerly
observed
porthos
everything
i
have
sent
grimaud
to
dammartin
said
aramis
he
is
to
bring
us
five
fresh
horses
one
for
his
eminence
four
for
us
we
at
least
must
keep
close
to
monseigneur
the
rest
of
the
start
will
rejoin
us
later
once
beyond
saint
denis
we
shall
have
nothing
to
grimaud
in
fact
brought
back
five
horses
the
nobleman
to
whom
he
applied
being
a
friend
of
porthos
was
very
ready
not
to
sell
them
as
was
proposed
but
to
lend
them
ten
minutes
later
the
escort
stopped
at
ermenonville
but
the
four
friends
went
on
with
well
sustained
ardor
guarding
mazarin
carefully
at
noon
they
rode
into
the
avenue
of
pierrefonds
ah
said
mousqueton
who
had
ridden
by
the
side
of
d
artagnan
without
speaking
a
word
on
the
journey
you
may
think
what
you
will
sir
but
i
can
breathe
now
for
the
first
time
since
my
departure
from
pierrefonds
and
he
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
to
announce
to
the
other
servants
the
arrival
of
monsieur
du
vallon
and
his
friends
we
are
four
of
us
said
d
artagnan
we
must
relieve
each
other
in
mounting
guard
over
my
lord
and
each
of
us
must
watch
three
hours
at
a
time
athos
is
going
to
examine
the
castle
which
it
will
be
necessary
to
render
impregnable
in
case
of
siege
porthos
will
see
to
the
provisions
and
aramis
to
the
troops
of
the
garrison
that
is
to
say
athos
will
be
chief
engineer
porthos
and
aramis
governor
of
the
meanwhile
they
gave
up
to
mazarin
the
handsomest
room
in
the
chateau
gentlemen
he
said
when
he
was
in
his
room
you
do
not
expect
i
presume
to
keep
me
here
a
long
time
incognito
no
my
lord
replied
the
gascon
on
the
contrary
we
think
of
announcing
very
soon
that
we
have
you
then
you
will
be
we
expect
and
what
shall
you
do
defend
ourselves
were
the
late
cardinal
richelieu
alive
he
would
tell
you
a
certain
story
of
the
bastion
saint
gervais
which
we
four
with
our
four
lackeys
and
twelve
dead
men
held
out
against
a
whole
such
feats
sir
are
done
once
and
never
however
nowadays
there
s
no
need
of
so
much
heroism
the
army
of
paris
will
be
summoned
the
day
after
it
will
be
here
the
field
of
battle
instead
therefore
of
being
at
saint
denis
or
at
charenton
will
be
near
compiegne
or
the
prince
will
vanquish
you
as
he
has
always
tis
possible
my
lord
but
before
an
engagement
ensues
we
shall
move
your
eminence
to
another
castle
belonging
to
our
friend
du
vallon
who
has
three
we
will
not
expose
your
eminence
to
the
chances
of
come
answered
mazarin
i
see
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
before
a
siege
yes
the
conditions
will
be
better
than
ah
my
lord
as
to
conditions
you
would
soon
see
how
moderate
and
reasonable
we
are
come
now
what
are
your
conditions
rest
yourself
first
my
lord
and
we
we
will
i
do
not
need
rest
gentlemen
i
need
to
know
whether
i
am
among
enemies
or
friends
my
lord
friends
well
then
tell
me
at
once
what
you
want
that
i
may
see
if
any
arrangement
be
possible
speak
comte
de
la
fere
my
lord
replied
athos
for
myself
i
have
nothing
to
demand
for
france
were
i
to
specify
my
wishes
i
should
have
too
much
i
beg
you
to
excuse
me
and
propose
to
the
and
athos
bowing
retired
and
remained
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
a
spectator
of
the
scene
speak
then
chevalier
said
the
cardinal
what
do
you
want
nothing
ambiguous
if
you
please
be
clear
short
and
as
for
me
replied
aramis
i
have
in
my
pocket
the
very
programme
of
the
conditions
which
the
deputation
of
which
i
formed
one
went
yesterday
to
saint
germain
to
impose
on
you
let
us
consider
first
the
ancient
rights
the
demands
in
that
programme
must
be
we
were
almost
agreed
on
those
replied
mazarin
let
us
pass
on
to
private
and
personal
you
suppose
then
that
there
are
some
said
aramis
smiling
i
do
not
suppose
that
you
will
all
be
quite
so
disinterested
as
monsieur
de
la
fere
replied
the
cardinal
bowing
to
athos
my
lord
you
are
right
and
i
am
glad
to
see
that
you
do
justice
to
the
count
at
last
the
count
has
a
mind
above
vulgar
desires
and
earthly
passions
he
is
a
proud
soul
he
is
a
man
by
himself
you
are
right
he
is
worth
us
all
and
we
avow
it
to
you
aramis
said
athos
are
you
jesting
no
no
dear
friend
i
state
only
what
we
all
know
you
are
right
it
is
not
you
alone
this
matter
concerns
but
my
lord
and
his
unworthy
servant
well
then
what
do
you
require
besides
the
general
conditions
before
recited
i
require
my
lord
that
normandy
should
be
given
to
madame
de
longueville
with
five
hundred
thousand
francs
and
full
absolution
i
require
that
his
majesty
should
deign
to
be
godfather
to
the
child
she
has
just
borne
and
that
my
lord
after
having
been
present
at
the
christening
should
go
to
proffer
his
homage
to
our
holy
father
the
that
is
you
wish
me
to
lay
aside
my
ministerial
functions
to
quit
france
and
be
an
i
wish
his
eminence
to
become
pope
on
the
first
opportunity
allowing
me
then
the
right
of
demanding
full
indulgences
for
myself
and
my
mazarin
made
a
grimace
which
was
quite
indescribable
and
then
turned
to
d
artagnan
and
you
sir
he
said
i
my
lord
answered
the
gascon
i
differ
from
monsieur
d
herblay
entirely
as
to
the
last
point
though
i
agree
with
him
on
the
first
far
from
wishing
my
lord
to
quit
paris
i
hope
he
will
stay
there
and
continue
to
be
prime
minister
as
he
is
a
great
statesman
i
shall
try
also
to
help
him
to
down
the
fronde
but
on
one
condition
that
he
sometimes
remembers
the
king
s
faithful
servants
and
gives
the
first
vacant
company
of
musketeers
to
a
man
that
i
could
name
and
you
monsieur
du
vallon
yes
you
sir
speak
if
you
please
said
mazarin
as
for
me
answered
porthos
i
wish
my
lord
cardinal
in
order
to
do
honor
to
my
house
which
gives
him
an
asylum
would
in
remembrance
of
this
adventure
erect
my
estate
into
a
barony
with
a
promise
to
confer
that
order
on
one
of
my
particular
friends
whenever
his
majesty
next
creates
you
know
sir
that
before
receiving
the
order
one
must
submit
my
friends
will
submit
them
besides
should
it
be
necessary
monseigneur
will
show
him
how
that
formality
may
be
mazarin
bit
his
lips
the
blow
was
direct
and
he
replied
rather
dryly
all
this
appears
to
me
to
be
ill
conceived
disjointed
gentlemen
for
if
i
satisfy
some
i
shall
displease
others
if
i
stay
in
paris
i
can
not
go
to
rome
if
i
became
pope
i
could
not
continue
to
be
prime
minister
and
it
is
only
by
continuing
prime
minister
that
i
can
make
monsieur
d
artagnan
a
captain
and
monsieur
du
vallon
a
true
said
aramis
so
as
i
am
in
a
minority
i
withdraw
my
proposition
so
far
as
it
relates
to
the
voyage
to
rome
and
monseigneur
s
i
am
to
remain
minister
then
said
mazarin
you
remain
minister
that
is
understood
said
d
artagnan
france
needs
and
i
desist
from
my
pretensions
said
aramis
his
eminence
will
continue
to
be
prime
minister
and
her
majesty
s
favorite
if
he
will
grant
to
me
and
my
friends
what
we
demand
for
france
and
for
occupy
yourselves
with
your
own
affairs
gentlemen
and
let
france
settle
matters
as
she
will
with
me
resumed
mazarin
ho
ho
replied
aramis
the
frondeurs
will
have
a
treaty
and
your
eminence
must
sign
it
before
us
promising
at
the
same
time
to
obtain
the
queen
s
consent
to
i
can
answer
only
for
myself
said
mazarin
i
can
not
answer
for
the
queen
suppose
her
majesty
refuses
oh
said
d
artagnan
monseigneur
knows
very
well
that
her
majesty
refuses
him
here
monseigneur
said
aramis
is
the
treaty
proposed
by
the
deputation
of
frondeurs
will
your
eminence
please
read
and
examine
i
am
acquainted
with
sign
it
reflect
gentlemen
that
a
signature
given
under
circumstances
like
the
present
might
be
regarded
as
extorted
by
monseigneur
will
be
at
hand
to
testify
that
it
was
freely
suppose
i
refuse
then
said
d
artagnan
your
eminence
must
expect
the
consequences
of
a
would
you
dare
to
touch
a
cardinal
you
have
dared
my
lord
to
imprison
her
majesty
s
the
queen
will
revenge
me
i
do
not
think
so
although
inclination
might
lead
her
to
do
so
but
we
shall
take
your
eminence
to
paris
and
the
parisians
will
defend
how
uneasy
they
must
be
at
this
moment
at
rueil
and
saint
germain
said
aramis
how
they
must
be
asking
where
is
the
cardinal
what
has
become
of
the
minister
where
has
the
favorite
gone
how
they
must
be
looking
for
monseigneur
in
all
corners
what
comments
must
be
made
and
if
the
fronde
knows
that
monseigneur
has
disappeared
how
the
fronde
must
triumph
it
is
frightful
murmured
mazarin
sign
the
treaty
then
monseigneur
said
aramis
suppose
the
queen
should
refuse
to
ratify
it
ah
nonsense
cried
d
artagnan
i
can
manage
so
that
her
majesty
will
receive
me
well
i
know
an
excellent
what
i
shall
take
her
majesty
the
letter
in
which
you
tell
her
that
the
finances
are
and
then
asked
mazarin
turning
pale
when
i
see
her
majesty
embarrassed
i
shall
conduct
her
to
rueil
make
her
enter
the
orangery
and
show
her
a
certain
spring
which
turns
a
enough
sir
muttered
the
cardinal
you
have
said
enough
where
is
the
treaty
here
it
is
replied
aramis
sign
my
lord
and
he
gave
him
a
pen
mazarin
arose
walked
some
moments
thoughtful
but
not
dejected
and
when
i
have
signed
he
said
what
is
to
be
my
guarantee
my
word
of
honor
sir
said
athos
mazarin
started
turned
toward
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
looking
for
an
instant
at
that
grand
and
honest
countenance
took
the
pen
it
is
sufficient
count
he
said
and
signed
the
treaty
and
now
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
said
prepare
to
set
off
for
saint
germain
and
take
a
letter
from
me
to
the
shows
how
with
threat
and
pen
more
is
effected
than
by
the
sword
d
artagnan
knew
his
part
well
he
was
aware
that
opportunity
has
a
forelock
only
for
him
who
will
take
it
and
he
was
not
a
man
to
let
it
go
by
him
without
seizing
it
he
soon
arranged
a
prompt
and
certain
manner
of
traveling
by
sending
relays
of
horses
to
chantilly
so
that
he
might
be
in
paris
in
five
or
six
hours
but
before
setting
out
he
reflected
that
for
a
lad
of
intelligence
and
experience
he
was
in
a
singular
predicament
since
he
was
proceeding
toward
uncertainty
and
leaving
certainty
behind
him
in
fact
he
said
as
he
was
about
to
mount
and
start
on
his
dangerous
mission
athos
for
generosity
is
a
hero
of
romance
porthos
has
an
excellent
disposition
but
is
easily
influenced
aramis
has
a
hieroglyphic
countenance
always
illegible
what
will
come
out
of
those
three
elements
when
i
am
no
longer
present
to
combine
them
the
deliverance
of
the
cardinal
perhaps
now
the
deliverance
of
the
cardinal
would
be
the
ruin
of
our
hopes
and
our
hopes
are
thus
far
the
only
recompense
we
have
for
labors
in
comparison
with
which
those
of
hercules
were
he
went
to
find
aramis
you
my
dear
chevalier
d
herblay
he
said
are
the
fronde
incarnate
mistrust
athos
therefore
who
will
not
prosecute
the
affairs
of
any
one
even
his
own
mistrust
porthos
especially
who
to
please
the
count
whom
he
regards
as
god
on
earth
will
assist
him
in
contriving
mazarin
s
escape
if
mazarin
has
the
wit
to
weep
or
play
the
aramis
smiled
his
smile
was
at
once
cunning
and
resolute
fear
nothing
he
said
i
have
my
conditions
to
impose
my
private
ambition
tends
only
to
the
profit
of
him
who
has
justice
on
his
good
thought
d
artagnan
in
this
direction
i
am
he
pressed
aramis
s
hand
and
went
in
search
of
porthos
friend
he
said
you
have
worked
so
hard
with
me
toward
building
up
our
fortune
that
at
the
moment
when
we
are
about
to
reap
the
fruits
of
our
labours
it
would
be
a
ridiculous
piece
of
silliness
in
you
to
allow
yourself
to
be
controlled
by
aramis
whose
cunning
you
know
a
cunning
which
we
may
say
between
ourselves
is
not
always
without
egotism
or
by
athos
a
noble
and
disinterested
man
but
blase
who
desiring
nothing
further
for
himself
doesn
t
sympathize
with
the
desires
of
others
what
should
you
say
if
either
of
these
two
friends
proposed
to
you
to
let
mazarin
go
why
i
should
say
that
we
had
too
much
trouble
in
taking
him
to
let
him
off
so
bravo
porthos
and
you
would
be
right
my
friend
for
in
losing
him
you
would
lose
your
barony
which
you
have
in
your
grasp
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
were
he
once
out
of
this
mazarin
would
have
you
do
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
then
i
would
kill
him
rather
than
let
him
and
you
would
act
rightly
there
is
no
question
you
understand
provided
we
secure
our
own
interests
of
securing
those
of
the
frondeurs
who
besides
don
t
understand
political
matters
as
we
old
soldiers
never
fear
dear
friend
said
porthos
i
shall
see
you
through
the
window
as
you
mount
your
horse
i
shall
follow
you
with
my
eyes
as
long
as
you
are
in
sight
then
i
shall
place
myself
at
the
cardinal
s
door
a
door
with
glass
windows
i
shall
see
everything
and
at
the
least
suspicious
sign
i
shall
begin
to
bravo
thought
d
artagnan
on
this
side
i
think
the
cardinal
will
be
well
he
pressed
the
hand
of
the
lord
of
pierrefonds
and
went
in
search
of
athos
my
dear
athos
he
said
i
am
going
away
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
to
you
you
know
anne
of
austria
the
captivity
of
mazarin
alone
guarantees
my
life
if
you
let
him
go
i
am
a
dead
i
needed
nothing
less
than
that
consideration
my
dear
d
artagnan
to
persuade
myself
to
adopt
the
role
of
jailer
i
give
you
my
word
that
you
will
find
the
cardinal
where
you
leave
this
reassures
me
more
than
all
the
royal
signatures
thought
d
artagnan
now
that
i
have
the
word
of
athos
i
can
set
d
artagnan
started
alone
on
his
journey
without
other
escort
than
his
sword
and
with
a
simple
passport
from
mazarin
to
secure
his
admission
to
the
queen
s
presence
six
hours
after
he
left
pierrefonds
he
was
at
saint
germain
the
disappearance
of
mazarin
was
not
as
yet
generally
known
anne
of
austria
was
informed
of
it
and
concealed
her
uneasiness
from
every
one
in
the
chamber
of
d
artagnan
and
porthos
the
two
soldiers
had
been
found
bound
and
gagged
on
recovering
the
use
of
their
limbs
and
tongues
they
could
of
course
tell
nothing
but
what
they
knew
that
they
had
been
seized
stripped
and
bound
but
as
to
what
had
been
done
by
porthos
and
d
artagnan
afterward
they
were
as
ignorant
as
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
chateau
bernouin
alone
knew
a
little
more
than
the
others
bernouin
seeing
that
his
master
did
not
return
and
hearing
the
stroke
of
midnight
had
made
an
examination
of
the
orangery
the
first
door
barricaded
with
furniture
had
aroused
in
him
certain
suspicions
but
without
communicating
his
suspicions
to
any
one
he
had
patiently
worked
his
way
into
the
midst
of
all
that
confusion
then
he
came
to
the
corridor
all
the
doors
of
which
he
found
open
so
too
was
the
door
of
athos
s
chamber
and
that
of
the
park
from
the
latter
point
it
was
easy
to
follow
tracks
on
the
snow
he
saw
that
these
tracks
tended
toward
the
wall
on
the
other
side
he
found
similar
tracks
then
footprints
of
horses
and
then
signs
of
a
troop
of
cavalry
which
had
moved
away
in
the
direction
of
enghien
he
could
no
longer
cherish
any
doubt
that
the
cardinal
had
been
carried
off
by
the
three
prisoners
since
the
prisoners
had
disappeared
at
the
same
time
and
he
had
hastened
to
saint
germain
to
warn
the
queen
of
that
disappearance
anne
had
enforced
the
utmost
secrecy
and
had
disclosed
the
event
to
no
one
except
the
prince
de
conde
who
had
sent
five
or
six
hundred
horsemen
into
the
environs
of
saint
germain
with
orders
to
bring
in
any
suspicious
person
who
was
going
away
from
rueil
in
whatsoever
direction
it
might
be
now
since
d
artagnan
did
not
constitute
a
body
of
horsemen
since
he
was
alone
since
he
was
not
going
away
from
rueil
and
was
going
to
saint
germain
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
him
and
his
journey
was
not
obstructed
in
any
way
on
entering
the
courtyard
of
the
old
chateau
the
first
person
seen
by
our
ambassador
was
maitre
bernouin
in
person
who
standing
on
the
threshold
awaited
news
of
his
vanished
master
at
the
sight
of
d
artagnan
who
entered
the
courtyard
on
horseback
bernouin
rubbed
his
eyes
and
thought
he
must
be
mistaken
but
d
artagnan
made
a
friendly
sign
to
him
with
his
head
dismounted
and
throwing
his
bridle
to
a
lackey
who
was
passing
he
approached
the
with
a
smile
on
his
lips
monsieur
d
artagnan
cried
the
latter
like
a
man
who
has
the
nightmare
and
talks
in
his
sleep
monsieur
d
artagnan
himself
monsieur
and
why
have
you
come
here
to
bring
news
of
monsieur
de
mazarin
the
freshest
news
there
what
has
become
of
him
then
he
is
as
well
as
you
and
nothing
bad
has
happened
to
him
then
absolutely
nothing
he
felt
the
need
of
making
a
trip
in
the
ile
de
france
and
begged
us
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
monsieur
du
vallon
to
accompany
him
we
were
too
devoted
servants
to
refuse
him
a
request
of
that
sort
we
set
out
last
evening
and
here
we
here
you
his
eminence
had
something
to
communicate
to
her
majesty
something
secret
and
private
a
mission
that
could
be
confided
only
to
a
sure
man
and
so
has
sent
me
to
saint
germain
and
therefore
my
dear
monsieur
bernouin
if
you
wish
to
do
what
will
be
pleasing
to
your
master
announce
to
her
majesty
that
i
have
come
and
tell
her
with
what
whether
he
spoke
seriously
or
in
jest
since
it
was
evident
that
under
existing
circumstances
d
artagnan
was
the
only
man
who
could
relieve
the
queen
s
uneasiness
bernouin
went
without
hesitation
to
announce
to
her
this
strange
embassy
and
as
he
had
foreseen
the
queen
gave
orders
to
introduce
monsieur
d
artagnan
at
once
d
artagnan
approached
the
sovereign
with
every
mark
of
profound
respect
and
having
fallen
on
his
knees
presented
to
her
the
cardinal
s
letter
it
was
however
merely
a
letter
of
introduction
the
queen
read
it
recognized
the
writing
and
since
there
were
no
details
in
it
of
what
had
occurred
asked
for
particulars
d
artagnan
related
everything
with
that
simple
and
ingenuous
air
which
he
knew
how
to
assume
on
occasions
the
queen
as
he
went
on
looked
at
him
with
increasing
astonishment
she
could
not
comprehend
how
a
man
could
conceive
such
an
enterprise
and
still
less
how
he
could
have
the
audacity
to
disclose
it
to
her
whose
interest
and
almost
duty
it
was
to
punish
him
how
sir
she
cried
as
d
artagnan
finished
you
dare
to
tell
me
the
details
of
your
crime
to
give
me
an
account
of
your
treason
pardon
madame
but
i
think
that
either
i
have
expressed
myself
badly
or
your
majesty
has
imperfectly
understood
me
there
is
here
no
question
of
crime
or
treason
monsieur
de
mazarin
held
us
in
prison
monsieur
du
vallon
and
myself
because
we
could
not
believe
that
he
had
sent
us
to
england
to
quietly
look
on
while
they
cut
off
the
head
of
charles
of
the
late
king
your
husband
the
consort
of
madame
henrietta
your
sister
and
your
guest
and
because
we
did
all
that
we
could
do
to
save
the
life
of
the
royal
martyr
we
were
then
convinced
my
friend
and
i
that
there
was
some
error
of
which
we
were
the
victims
and
that
an
explanation
was
called
for
between
his
eminence
and
ourselves
now
that
an
explanation
may
bear
fruit
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
be
quietly
conducted
far
from
noise
and
interruption
we
have
therefore
taken
away
monsieur
le
cardinal
to
my
friend
s
chateau
and
there
we
have
come
to
an
understanding
well
madame
it
proved
to
be
as
we
had
supposed
there
was
a
mistake
monsieur
de
mazarin
had
thought
that
we
had
rendered
service
to
general
cromwell
instead
of
king
charles
which
would
have
been
a
disgrace
rebounding
from
us
to
him
and
from
him
to
your
majesty
a
dishonor
which
would
have
tainted
the
royalty
of
your
illustrious
son
we
were
able
to
prove
the
contrary
and
that
proof
we
are
ready
to
give
to
your
majesty
calling
in
support
of
it
the
august
widow
weeping
in
the
louvre
where
your
royal
munificence
has
provided
for
her
a
home
that
proof
satisfied
him
so
completely
that
as
a
sign
of
satisfaction
he
has
sent
me
as
your
majesty
may
see
to
consider
with
you
what
reparation
should
be
made
to
gentlemen
unjustly
treated
and
wrongfully
i
listen
to
you
and
i
wonder
at
you
sir
said
the
queen
in
fact
i
have
rarely
seen
such
excess
of
your
majesty
on
your
side
said
d
artagnan
is
as
much
mistaken
as
to
our
intentions
as
the
cardinal
mazarin
has
always
you
are
in
error
sir
answered
the
queen
i
am
so
little
mistaken
that
in
ten
minutes
you
shall
be
arrested
and
in
an
hour
i
shall
set
off
at
the
head
of
my
army
to
release
my
i
am
sure
your
majesty
will
not
commit
such
an
act
of
imprudence
first
because
it
would
be
useless
and
would
produce
the
most
disastrous
results
before
he
could
be
possibly
set
free
the
cardinal
would
be
dead
and
indeed
so
convinced
is
he
of
this
that
he
entreated
me
should
i
find
your
majesty
disposed
to
act
in
this
way
to
do
all
i
could
to
induce
you
to
change
your
well
then
i
will
content
myself
with
arresting
you
madame
the
possibility
of
my
arrest
has
been
foreseen
and
should
i
not
have
returned
by
at
a
certain
hour
the
next
day
the
cardinal
will
be
brought
to
paris
and
delivered
to
the
it
is
evident
sir
that
your
position
has
kept
you
out
of
relation
to
men
and
affairs
otherwise
you
would
know
that
since
we
left
paris
monsieur
le
cardinal
has
returned
thither
five
or
six
times
that
he
has
there
met
de
beaufort
de
bouillon
the
coadjutor
and
d
elbeuf
and
that
not
one
of
them
had
any
desire
to
arrest
your
pardon
madame
i
know
all
that
and
therefore
my
friends
will
conduct
monsieur
le
cardinal
neither
to
de
beaufort
nor
to
de
bouillon
nor
to
the
coadjutor
nor
to
d
elbeuf
these
gentlemen
wage
war
on
private
account
and
in
buying
them
up
by
granting
them
what
they
wished
monsieur
le
cardinal
has
made
a
good
bargain
he
will
be
delivered
to
the
parliament
members
of
which
can
of
course
be
bought
but
even
monsieur
de
mazarin
is
not
rich
enough
to
buy
the
whole
i
think
returned
anne
of
austria
fixing
upon
him
a
glance
which
in
any
woman
s
face
would
have
expressed
disdain
but
in
a
queen
s
spread
terror
to
those
she
looked
upon
nay
i
perceive
you
dare
to
threaten
the
mother
of
your
madame
replied
d
artagnan
i
threaten
simply
and
solely
because
i
am
obliged
to
do
so
believe
me
madame
as
true
a
thing
as
it
is
that
a
heart
beats
in
this
bosom
a
heart
devoted
to
you
believe
that
you
have
been
the
idol
of
our
lives
that
we
have
as
you
well
know
good
heaven
risked
our
lives
twenty
times
for
your
majesty
have
you
then
madame
no
compassion
for
your
servants
who
for
twenty
years
have
vegetated
in
obscurity
without
betraying
in
a
single
sigh
the
solemn
and
sacred
secrets
they
have
had
the
honor
to
share
with
you
look
at
me
madame
at
me
whom
you
accuse
of
speaking
loud
and
threateningly
what
am
i
a
poor
officer
without
fortune
without
protection
without
a
future
unless
the
eye
of
my
queen
which
i
have
sought
so
long
rests
on
me
for
a
moment
look
at
the
comte
de
la
fere
a
type
of
nobility
a
flower
of
chivalry
he
has
taken
part
against
his
queen
or
rather
against
her
minister
he
has
not
been
unreasonably
exacting
it
seems
to
me
look
at
monsieur
du
vallon
that
faithful
soul
that
arm
of
steel
who
for
twenty
years
has
awaited
the
word
from
your
lips
which
will
make
him
in
rank
what
he
is
in
sentiment
and
in
courage
consider
in
short
your
people
who
love
you
and
who
yet
are
famished
who
have
no
other
wish
than
to
bless
you
and
who
nevertheless
no
i
am
wrong
your
subjects
madame
will
never
curse
you
say
one
word
to
them
and
all
will
be
ended
peace
succeed
war
joy
tears
and
happiness
to
misfortune
anne
of
austria
looked
with
wonderment
on
the
warlike
countenance
of
d
artagnan
which
betrayed
a
singular
expression
of
deep
feeling
why
did
you
not
say
all
this
before
you
took
action
sir
she
said
because
madame
it
was
necessary
to
prove
to
your
majesty
one
thing
of
which
you
doubted
is
that
we
still
possess
amongst
us
some
valor
and
are
worthy
of
some
consideration
at
your
and
that
valor
would
shrink
from
no
undertaking
according
to
what
i
it
has
hesitated
at
nothing
in
the
past
why
then
should
it
be
less
daring
in
the
future
then
in
case
of
my
refusal
this
valor
should
a
struggle
occur
will
even
go
the
length
of
carrying
me
off
in
the
midst
of
my
court
to
deliver
me
into
the
hands
of
the
fronde
as
you
propose
to
deliver
my
minister
we
have
not
thought
about
it
yet
madame
answered
d
artagnan
with
that
gascon
effrontery
which
had
in
him
the
appearance
of
naivete
but
if
we
four
had
resolved
upon
it
we
should
do
it
most
i
ought
muttered
anne
to
herself
by
this
time
to
remember
that
these
men
are
alas
madame
exclaimed
d
artagnan
this
proves
to
me
that
not
till
has
your
majesty
had
a
just
idea
of
perhaps
said
anne
but
that
idea
if
at
last
i
have
it
your
majesty
will
do
us
justice
in
doing
us
justice
you
will
no
longer
treat
us
as
men
of
vulgar
stamp
you
will
see
in
me
an
ambassador
worthy
of
the
high
interests
he
is
authorized
to
discuss
with
his
where
is
the
treaty
here
it
anne
of
austria
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
treaty
that
d
artagnan
presented
to
her
i
do
not
see
here
she
said
anything
but
general
conditions
the
interests
of
the
prince
de
conti
or
of
the
ducs
de
beaufort
de
bouillon
and
d
elbeuf
and
of
the
coadjutor
are
herein
consulted
but
with
regard
to
yours
we
do
ourselves
justice
madame
even
in
assuming
the
high
position
that
we
have
we
do
not
think
ourselves
worthy
to
stand
near
such
great
but
you
i
presume
have
decided
to
assert
your
pretensions
viva
voce
i
believe
you
madame
to
be
a
great
and
powerful
queen
and
that
it
will
be
unworthy
of
your
power
and
greatness
if
you
do
not
recompense
the
arms
which
will
bring
back
his
eminence
to
saint
it
is
my
intention
so
to
do
come
let
us
hear
you
he
who
has
negotiated
these
matters
forgive
me
if
i
begin
by
speaking
of
myself
but
i
must
claim
that
importance
which
has
been
given
to
me
not
assumed
by
me
he
who
has
arranged
matters
for
the
return
of
the
cardinal
ought
it
appears
to
me
in
order
that
his
reward
may
not
be
unworthy
of
your
majesty
to
be
made
commandant
of
the
guards
an
appointment
something
like
that
of
captain
of
the
tis
the
appointment
monsieur
de
treville
held
you
ask
of
the
place
madame
is
vacant
and
although
tis
a
year
since
monsieur
de
treville
has
left
it
it
has
not
been
but
it
is
one
of
the
principal
military
appointments
in
the
king
s
monsieur
de
treville
was
but
a
younger
son
of
a
simple
gascon
family
like
me
madame
he
occupied
that
post
for
twenty
you
have
an
answer
ready
for
everything
replied
the
queen
and
she
took
from
her
bureau
a
document
which
she
filled
up
and
signed
undoubtedly
madame
said
d
artagnan
taking
the
document
and
bowing
this
is
a
noble
reward
but
everything
in
the
world
is
unstable
and
the
man
who
happened
to
fall
into
disgrace
with
your
majesty
might
lose
this
office
what
more
do
you
want
asked
the
queen
coloring
as
she
found
that
she
had
to
deal
with
a
mind
as
subtle
as
her
own
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
this
poor
captain
of
musketeers
to
be
paid
whenever
his
services
shall
no
longer
be
acceptable
to
your
anne
hesitated
to
think
of
the
parisians
soliloquized
d
artagnan
offering
only
the
other
day
by
an
edict
of
the
parliament
six
hundred
thousand
francs
to
any
man
soever
who
would
deliver
up
the
cardinal
to
them
dead
or
alive
if
alive
in
order
to
hang
him
if
dead
to
deny
him
the
rites
of
christian
burial
come
said
anne
tis
reasonable
since
you
only
ask
from
a
queen
the
sixth
of
what
the
parliament
has
proposed
and
she
signed
an
order
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
now
then
she
said
what
next
madame
my
friend
du
vallon
is
rich
and
has
therefore
nothing
in
the
way
of
fortune
to
desire
but
i
think
i
remember
that
there
was
a
question
between
him
and
monsieur
mazarin
as
to
making
his
estate
a
barony
nay
it
must
have
been
a
a
country
clown
said
anne
of
austria
people
will
let
them
answered
d
artagnan
but
i
am
sure
of
one
thing
that
those
who
laugh
at
him
in
his
presence
will
never
laugh
a
second
here
goes
the
said
the
queen
she
signed
a
patent
now
there
remains
the
chevalier
or
the
abbe
d
herblay
as
your
majesty
does
he
wish
to
be
a
bishop
no
madame
something
easier
to
what
it
is
that
the
king
should
deign
to
stand
godfather
to
the
son
of
madame
de
the
queen
smiled
monsieur
de
longueville
is
of
royal
blood
madame
said
d
artagnan
yes
said
the
queen
but
his
son
his
son
madame
must
be
since
the
husband
of
the
son
s
mother
and
your
friend
has
nothing
more
to
ask
for
madame
de
longueville
no
madame
for
i
presume
that
the
king
standing
godfather
to
him
could
do
no
less
than
present
him
with
five
hundred
thousand
francs
giving
his
father
also
the
government
of
as
to
the
government
of
normandy
replied
the
queen
i
think
i
can
promise
but
with
regard
to
the
present
the
cardinal
is
always
telling
me
there
is
no
more
money
in
the
royal
we
shall
search
for
some
madame
and
i
think
we
can
find
a
little
and
if
your
majesty
approves
we
will
seek
for
some
what
next
what
next
madame
that
is
haven
t
you
then
a
fourth
companion
yes
madame
the
comte
de
la
what
does
he
ask
there
is
in
the
world
then
one
man
who
having
the
power
to
ask
asks
nothing
there
is
the
comte
de
la
fere
madame
the
comte
de
la
fere
is
not
a
what
is
he
then
the
comte
de
la
fere
is
a
has
he
not
a
son
a
young
man
a
relative
a
nephew
of
whom
comminges
spoke
to
me
as
being
a
brave
boy
and
who
with
monsieur
de
chatillon
brought
the
standards
from
lens
he
has
as
your
majesty
has
said
a
ward
who
is
called
the
vicomte
de
if
that
young
man
should
be
appointed
to
a
regiment
what
would
his
guardian
say
perhaps
he
would
perhaps
yes
if
your
majesty
herself
should
beg
him
to
he
must
be
indeed
a
strange
man
well
we
will
reflect
and
perhaps
we
will
beg
him
are
you
satisfied
sir
there
is
one
thing
the
queen
has
not
signed
her
assent
to
the
of
what
use
i
will
sign
it
i
can
assure
her
majesty
that
if
she
does
not
sign
she
will
not
have
time
to
sign
consent
then
i
beg
you
madame
to
write
at
the
bottom
of
this
schedule
which
has
been
drawn
up
by
mazarin
as
you
see
i
consent
to
ratify
the
treaty
proposed
by
the
anne
was
caught
she
could
not
draw
back
she
signed
but
scarcely
had
she
done
so
when
pride
burst
forth
and
she
began
to
weep
d
artagnan
started
on
seeing
these
tears
since
that
period
of
history
queens
have
shed
tears
like
other
women
the
gascon
shook
his
head
these
tears
from
royalty
melted
his
heart
madame
he
said
kneeling
look
upon
the
unhappy
man
at
your
feet
he
begs
you
to
believe
that
at
a
gesture
of
your
majesty
everything
will
be
possible
to
him
he
has
faith
in
himself
he
has
faith
in
his
friends
he
wishes
also
to
have
faith
in
his
queen
and
in
proof
that
he
fears
nothing
that
he
counts
on
nothing
he
will
restore
monsieur
de
mazarin
to
your
majesty
without
conditions
behold
madame
here
are
the
august
signatures
of
your
majesty
s
hand
if
you
think
you
are
right
in
giving
them
to
me
you
shall
do
so
but
from
this
very
moment
you
are
free
from
any
obligation
to
keep
and
d
artagnan
full
of
splendid
pride
and
manly
intrepidity
placed
in
anne
s
hands
in
a
bundle
the
papers
that
he
had
one
by
one
won
from
her
with
so
much
difficulty
there
are
moments
for
if
everything
is
not
good
everything
in
this
world
is
not
bad
in
which
the
most
rigid
and
the
coldest
soul
is
softened
by
the
tears
of
strong
emotion
sentiment
one
of
these
momentary
impulses
actuated
anne
d
artagnan
when
he
gave
way
to
his
own
feelings
which
were
in
accordance
with
those
of
the
queen
had
accomplished
more
than
the
most
astute
diplomacy
could
have
attempted
he
was
therefore
instantly
recompensed
either
for
his
address
or
for
his
sensibility
whichever
it
might
be
termed
you
were
right
sir
said
anne
i
misunderstood
you
there
are
the
acts
signed
i
deliver
them
to
you
without
compulsion
go
and
bring
me
back
the
cardinal
as
soon
as
madame
faltered
d
artagnan
tis
twenty
years
ago
i
have
a
good
memory
since
i
had
the
honor
behind
a
piece
of
tapestry
in
the
hotel
de
ville
of
kissing
one
of
those
lovely
there
is
the
other
replied
the
queen
and
that
the
left
hand
should
not
be
less
liberal
than
the
right
she
drew
from
her
finger
a
diamond
similar
to
the
one
formerly
given
to
him
take
and
keep
this
ring
in
remembrance
of
me
madame
said
d
artagnan
rising
i
have
only
one
thing
more
to
wish
which
is
that
the
next
thing
you
ask
from
me
shall
be
my
and
with
this
conclusion
a
way
peculiar
to
himself
he
rose
and
left
the
room
i
never
rightly
understood
those
men
said
the
queen
as
she
watched
him
retiring
from
her
presence
and
it
is
now
too
late
for
in
a
year
the
king
will
be
of
in
hours
d
artagnan
and
porthos
conducted
mazarin
to
the
queen
and
the
one
received
his
commission
the
other
his
patent
of
nobility
on
the
same
day
the
treaty
of
paris
was
signed
and
it
was
everywhere
announced
that
the
cardinal
had
shut
himself
up
for
three
days
in
order
to
draw
it
up
with
the
greatest
care
here
is
what
each
of
the
parties
concerned
gained
by
that
treaty
monsieur
de
conti
received
damvilliers
and
having
made
his
proofs
as
general
he
succeeded
in
remaining
a
soldier
instead
of
being
made
cardinal
moreover
something
had
been
said
of
a
marriage
with
mazarin
s
niece
the
idea
was
welcomed
by
the
prince
to
whom
it
was
of
little
importance
whom
he
married
so
long
as
he
married
some
one
the
duc
de
beaufort
made
his
entrance
at
court
receiving
ample
reparation
for
the
wrongs
he
had
suffered
and
all
the
honor
due
to
his
rank
full
pardon
was
accorded
to
those
who
had
aided
in
his
escape
he
received
also
the
office
of
admiral
which
had
been
held
by
his
father
the
duc
de
vendome
and
an
indemnity
for
his
houses
and
castles
demolished
by
the
parliament
of
bretagne
the
duc
de
bouillon
received
domains
of
a
value
equal
to
that
of
his
principality
of
sedan
and
the
title
of
prince
granted
to
him
and
to
those
belonging
to
his
house
the
duc
de
longueville
gained
the
government
of
arche
five
hundred
thousand
francs
for
his
wife
and
the
honor
of
seeing
her
son
held
at
the
baptismal
font
by
the
young
king
and
henrietta
of
england
aramis
stipulated
that
bazin
should
officiate
at
that
ceremony
and
that
planchet
should
furnish
the
christening
sugar
plums
the
duc
d
elbeuf
obtained
payment
of
certain
sums
due
to
his
wife
one
hundred
thousand
francs
for
his
eldest
son
and
thousand
for
each
of
the
three
others
the
coadjutor
alone
obtained
nothing
they
promised
indeed
to
negotiate
with
the
pope
for
a
cardinal
s
hat
for
him
but
he
knew
how
little
reliance
should
be
placed
on
such
promises
made
by
the
queen
and
mazarin
quite
contrary
to
the
lot
of
monsieur
de
conti
unable
to
be
cardinal
he
was
obliged
to
remain
a
soldier
and
therefore
when
all
paris
was
rejoicing
in
the
expected
return
of
the
king
appointed
for
the
next
day
gondy
alone
in
the
midst
of
the
general
happiness
was
dissatisfied
he
sent
for
the
two
men
whom
he
was
wont
to
summon
when
in
especially
bad
humor
those
two
men
were
the
count
de
rochefort
and
the
mendicant
of
saint
eustache
they
came
with
their
usual
promptness
and
the
coadjutor
spent
with
them
a
part
of
the
night
difficult
for
kings
to
return
to
the
capitals
of
their
kingdoms
whilst
d
artagnan
and
porthos
were
engaged
in
conducting
the
cardinal
to
saint
germain
athos
and
aramis
returned
to
paris
each
had
his
own
particular
visit
to
make
aramis
rushed
to
the
hotel
de
ville
where
madame
de
longueville
was
sojourning
the
duchess
loudly
lamented
the
announcement
of
peace
war
had
made
her
a
queen
peace
brought
her
abdication
she
declared
that
she
would
never
assent
to
the
treaty
and
that
she
wished
eternal
war
but
when
aramis
had
presented
that
peace
to
her
in
a
true
light
that
is
to
say
with
all
its
advantages
when
he
had
pointed
out
to
her
in
exchange
for
the
precarious
and
contested
royalty
of
paris
the
viceroyalty
of
arche
in
other
words
of
all
normandy
when
he
had
rung
in
her
ears
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
promised
by
the
cardinal
when
he
had
dazzled
her
eyes
with
the
honor
bestowed
on
her
by
the
king
in
holding
her
child
at
the
baptismal
font
madame
de
longueville
contended
no
longer
except
as
is
the
custom
with
pretty
women
to
contend
and
defended
herself
only
to
surrender
at
last
aramis
made
a
presence
of
believing
in
the
reality
of
her
opposition
and
was
unwilling
to
deprive
himself
in
his
own
view
of
the
credit
of
her
conversion
madame
he
said
you
have
wished
to
conquer
the
prince
your
brother
that
is
to
say
the
greatest
captain
of
the
age
and
when
women
of
genius
wish
anything
they
always
succeed
in
attaining
it
you
have
succeeded
the
prince
is
beaten
since
he
can
no
longer
fight
now
attach
him
to
our
party
withdraw
him
gently
from
the
queen
whom
he
does
not
like
from
mazarin
whom
he
despises
the
fronde
is
a
comedy
of
which
the
first
act
only
is
played
let
us
wait
for
a
denouement
for
the
day
when
the
prince
thanks
to
you
shall
have
turned
against
the
madame
de
longueville
was
persuaded
this
frondist
duchess
trusted
so
confidently
to
the
power
of
her
fine
eyes
that
she
could
not
doubt
their
influence
even
over
monsieur
de
conde
and
the
chronicles
of
the
time
aver
that
her
confidence
was
justified
athos
on
quitting
aramis
went
to
madame
de
chevreuse
here
was
another
frondeuse
to
persuade
and
she
was
even
less
open
to
conviction
than
her
younger
rival
there
had
been
no
stipulation
in
her
favor
monsieur
de
chevreuse
had
not
been
appointed
governor
of
a
province
and
if
the
queen
should
consent
to
be
godmother
it
could
be
only
of
her
grandson
or
granddaughter
at
the
first
announcement
of
peace
madame
de
chevreuse
frowned
and
in
spite
of
all
the
logic
of
athos
to
show
her
that
a
prolonged
war
would
have
been
impracticable
contended
in
favor
of
hostilities
my
fair
friend
said
athos
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
everybody
is
tired
of
war
you
will
get
yourself
exiled
as
you
did
in
the
time
of
louis
xiii
believe
me
we
have
passed
the
time
of
success
in
intrigue
and
your
fine
eyes
are
not
destined
to
be
eclipsed
by
regretting
paris
where
there
will
always
be
two
queens
as
long
as
you
are
oh
cried
the
duchess
i
can
not
make
war
alone
but
i
can
avenge
myself
on
that
ungrateful
queen
and
most
ambitious
the
honor
of
a
duchess
i
will
avenge
madame
replied
athos
do
not
injure
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
do
not
ruin
his
prospects
alas
excuse
my
weakness
there
are
moments
when
a
man
grows
young
again
in
his
the
duchess
smiled
half
tenderly
half
ironically
count
she
said
you
are
i
fear
gained
over
to
the
court
i
suppose
you
have
a
blue
ribbon
in
your
pocket
yes
madame
i
have
that
of
the
garter
which
king
charles
gave
me
some
days
before
he
come
i
am
growing
an
old
woman
said
the
duchess
pensively
athos
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
she
sighed
as
she
looked
at
him
count
she
said
bragelonne
must
be
a
charming
place
you
are
a
man
of
taste
you
have
water
woods
flowers
there
she
sighed
again
and
leaned
her
charming
head
gracefully
reclined
on
her
hand
still
beautiful
in
form
and
color
madame
exclaimed
athos
what
were
you
saying
just
now
about
growing
old
never
have
i
seen
you
look
so
young
so
beautiful
the
duchess
shook
her
head
does
monsieur
de
bragelonne
remain
in
paris
she
inquired
what
think
you
of
it
inquired
athos
leave
him
with
me
replied
the
duchess
no
madame
if
you
have
forgotten
the
history
of
oedipus
i
at
least
remember
really
sir
you
are
delightful
and
i
should
like
to
spend
a
month
at
are
you
not
afraid
of
making
people
envious
of
me
duchess
replied
athos
no
i
shall
go
incognito
count
under
the
name
of
marie
you
are
adorable
but
do
not
keep
raoul
with
why
not
because
he
is
in
he
he
is
quite
a
child
and
tis
a
child
he
athos
became
thoughtful
you
are
right
duchess
this
singular
passion
for
a
child
of
seven
may
some
day
make
him
very
unhappy
there
is
to
be
war
in
flanders
he
shall
go
and
at
his
return
you
will
send
him
to
me
i
will
arm
him
against
alas
madame
exclaimed
athos
love
is
like
war
the
breastplate
is
becoming
raoul
entered
at
this
moment
he
came
to
announce
that
the
solemn
entrance
of
the
king
queen
and
her
ministers
was
to
take
place
on
the
ensuing
day
the
next
day
in
fact
at
daybreak
the
court
made
preparations
to
quit
saint
germain
meanwhile
the
queen
every
hour
had
been
sending
for
d
artagnan
i
hear
she
said
that
paris
is
not
quiet
i
am
afraid
for
the
king
s
safety
place
yourself
close
to
the
coach
door
on
the
reassure
yourself
madame
i
will
answer
for
the
king
s
as
he
left
the
queen
s
presence
bernouin
summoned
him
to
the
cardinal
sir
said
mazarin
to
him
an
emeute
is
spoken
of
in
paris
i
shall
be
on
the
king
s
left
and
as
i
am
the
chief
person
threatened
remain
at
the
coach
door
to
the
your
eminence
may
be
perfectly
easy
replied
d
artagnan
they
will
not
touch
a
hair
of
your
deuce
take
it
he
thought
to
himself
how
can
i
take
care
of
both
ah
plague
on
t
i
will
guard
the
king
and
porthos
shall
guard
the
this
arrangement
pleased
every
one
the
queen
had
confidence
in
the
courage
of
d
artagnan
which
she
knew
and
the
cardinal
in
the
strength
of
porthos
which
he
had
experienced
the
royal
procession
set
out
for
paris
guitant
and
comminges
at
the
head
of
the
guards
marched
first
then
came
the
royal
carriage
with
d
artagnan
on
one
side
porthos
on
the
other
then
the
musketeers
for
two
and
twenty
years
staunch
friends
of
d
artagnan
during
twenty
he
had
been
lieutenant
their
captain
since
the
night
before
the
cortege
proceeded
to
notre
dame
where
a
te
deum
was
chanted
all
paris
were
in
the
streets
the
swiss
were
drawn
up
along
the
road
but
as
the
road
was
long
they
were
placed
at
six
or
eight
feet
distant
from
each
other
and
one
deep
only
this
force
was
therefore
wholly
insufficient
and
from
time
to
time
the
line
was
broken
through
by
the
people
and
was
formed
again
with
difficulty
whenever
this
occurred
although
it
proceeded
only
from
goodwill
and
a
desire
to
see
the
king
and
queen
anne
looked
at
d
artagnan
anxiously
mazarin
who
had
dispensed
a
thousand
louis
to
make
the
people
cry
long
live
mazarin
and
who
had
accordingly
no
confidence
in
acclamations
bought
at
twenty
pistoles
each
kept
one
eye
on
porthos
but
that
gigantic
replied
to
the
look
with
his
great
bass
voice
be
tranquil
my
lord
and
mazarin
became
more
and
more
composed
at
the
palais
royal
the
crowd
which
had
flowed
in
from
the
adjacent
street
was
still
greater
like
an
impetuous
mob
a
wave
of
human
beings
came
to
meet
the
carriage
and
rolled
tumultuously
into
the
rue
saint
honore
when
the
procession
reached
the
palace
loud
cries
of
long
live
their
majesties
resounded
mazarin
leaned
out
of
the
window
one
or
two
shouts
of
long
live
the
cardinal
saluted
his
shadow
but
instantly
hisses
and
yells
stifled
them
remorselessly
mazarin
turned
pale
and
shrank
back
in
the
coach
fellows
ejaculated
porthos
d
artagnan
said
nothing
but
twirled
his
mustache
with
a
peculiar
gesture
which
showed
that
his
fine
gascon
humor
was
awake
anne
of
austria
bent
down
and
whispered
in
the
young
king
s
ear
say
something
gracious
to
monsieur
d
artagnan
my
the
young
king
leaned
toward
the
door
i
have
not
said
to
you
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
said
nevertheless
i
have
remarked
you
it
was
you
who
were
behind
my
that
night
the
parisians
wished
to
see
me
and
if
the
king
permits
me
returned
the
gascon
i
shall
be
near
him
always
when
there
is
danger
to
be
sir
said
mazarin
to
porthos
what
would
you
do
if
the
crowd
fell
upon
us
kill
as
many
as
i
could
my
hem
brave
as
you
are
and
strong
as
you
are
you
could
not
kill
them
tis
true
answered
porthos
rising
on
his
saddle
in
order
that
he
might
appraise
the
immense
crowd
there
are
a
lot
of
i
think
i
should
like
the
other
fellow
better
than
this
one
said
mazarin
to
himself
and
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
carriage
the
queen
and
her
minister
more
especially
the
latter
had
reason
to
feel
anxious
the
crowd
whilst
preserving
an
appearance
of
respect
and
even
of
affection
for
the
king
and
queen
regent
began
to
be
tumultuous
reports
were
whispered
about
like
certain
sounds
which
announce
as
they
whistle
from
wave
to
wave
the
coming
storm
and
when
they
pass
athwart
a
multitude
presage
an
emeute
d
artagnan
turned
toward
the
musketeers
and
made
a
sign
imperceptible
to
the
crowd
but
very
easily
understood
by
that
chosen
regiment
the
flower
of
the
army
the
ranks
closed
firmly
in
and
a
kind
of
majestic
tremor
ran
from
man
to
man
at
the
barriere
des
sergents
the
procession
was
obliged
to
stop
comminges
left
the
head
of
the
escort
and
went
to
the
queen
s
carriage
anne
questioned
d
artagnan
by
a
look
he
answered
in
the
same
language
proceed
she
said
comminges
returned
to
his
post
an
effort
was
made
and
the
living
barrier
was
violently
broken
through
some
complaints
arose
from
the
crowd
and
were
addressed
this
time
to
the
king
as
well
as
the
minister
onward
cried
d
artagnan
in
a
loud
voice
onward
cried
porthos
but
as
if
the
multitude
had
waited
only
for
this
demonstration
to
burst
out
all
the
sentiments
of
hostility
that
possessed
it
exploded
simultaneously
cries
of
down
with
mazarin
death
to
the
cardinal
resounded
on
all
sides
at
the
same
time
through
the
streets
of
grenelle
saint
honore
and
du
coq
a
double
stream
of
people
broke
the
feeble
hedge
of
swiss
guards
and
came
like
a
whirlwind
even
to
the
very
legs
of
porthos
s
horse
and
that
of
d
artagnan
this
new
eruption
was
more
dangerous
than
the
others
being
composed
of
armed
men
it
was
plain
that
it
was
not
the
chance
combination
of
those
who
had
collected
a
number
of
the
malcontents
at
the
same
spot
but
a
concerted
organized
attack
each
of
these
mobs
was
led
by
a
chief
one
of
whom
appeared
to
belong
not
to
the
people
but
to
the
honorable
corporation
of
mendicants
and
the
other
notwithstanding
his
affected
imitation
of
the
people
might
easily
be
discerned
to
be
a
gentleman
both
were
evidently
stimulated
by
the
same
impulse
there
was
a
shock
which
was
perceived
even
in
the
royal
carriage
myriads
of
hoarse
cries
forming
one
vast
uproar
were
heard
mingled
with
guns
firing
ho
musketeers
cried
d
artagnan
the
escort
divided
into
two
files
one
of
them
passed
around
to
the
right
of
the
carriage
the
other
to
the
left
one
went
to
support
d
artagnan
the
other
porthos
then
came
a
skirmish
the
more
terrible
because
it
had
no
definite
object
the
more
melancholy
because
those
engaged
in
it
knew
not
for
whom
they
were
fighting
like
all
popular
movements
the
shock
given
by
the
rush
of
this
mob
was
formidable
the
musketeers
few
in
number
not
being
able
in
the
midst
of
this
crowd
to
make
their
horses
wheel
around
began
to
give
way
d
artagnan
offered
to
lower
the
blinds
of
the
royal
carriage
but
the
young
king
stretched
out
his
arm
saying
no
sir
i
wish
to
see
if
your
majesty
wishes
to
look
out
well
then
look
replied
d
artagnan
and
turning
with
that
fury
which
made
him
so
formidable
he
rushed
toward
the
chief
of
the
insurgents
a
man
who
with
a
huge
sword
in
his
hand
was
trying
to
hew
a
passage
to
the
coach
door
through
the
musketeers
make
room
cried
d
artagnan
zounds
give
way
at
these
words
the
man
with
a
pistol
and
sword
raised
his
head
but
it
was
too
late
the
blow
was
sped
by
d
artagnan
the
rapier
had
pierced
his
bosom
ah
confound
it
cried
the
gascon
trying
in
vain
too
late
to
retract
the
thrust
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
here
count
accomplishing
my
destiny
replied
rochefort
falling
on
one
knee
i
have
already
got
up
again
after
three
stabs
from
you
i
shall
never
rise
after
this
count
said
d
artagnan
with
some
degree
of
emotion
i
struck
without
knowing
that
it
was
you
i
am
sorry
if
you
die
that
you
should
die
with
sentiments
of
hatred
toward
rochefort
extended
his
hand
to
d
artagnan
who
took
it
the
count
wished
to
speak
but
a
gush
of
blood
stifled
him
he
stiffened
in
the
last
convulsions
of
death
and
expired
back
people
cried
d
artagnan
your
leader
is
dead
you
have
no
longer
any
business
indeed
as
if
de
rochefort
had
been
the
very
soul
of
the
attack
the
crowd
who
had
followed
and
obeyed
him
took
to
flight
on
seeing
him
fall
d
artagnan
charged
with
a
party
of
musketeers
up
the
rue
du
coq
and
the
portion
of
the
mob
he
assailed
disappeared
like
smoke
dispersing
near
the
place
saint
auxerrois
and
taking
the
direction
of
the
quays
d
artagnan
returned
to
help
porthos
if
porthos
needed
help
but
porthos
for
his
part
had
done
his
work
as
conscientiously
as
d
artagnan
the
left
of
the
carriage
was
as
well
cleared
as
the
right
and
they
drew
up
the
blind
of
the
window
which
mazarin
less
heroic
than
the
king
had
taken
the
precaution
to
lower
porthos
looked
very
melancholy
what
a
devil
of
a
face
you
have
porthos
and
what
a
strange
air
for
a
victor
but
you
answered
porthos
seem
to
me
there
s
a
reason
zounds
i
have
just
killed
an
old
indeed
replied
porthos
who
that
poor
count
de
well
exactly
like
me
i
have
just
killed
a
man
whose
face
is
not
unknown
to
me
unluckily
i
hit
him
on
the
head
and
immediately
his
face
was
covered
with
and
he
said
nothing
as
he
died
yes
he
exclaimed
oh
i
suppose
answered
d
artagnan
laughing
if
he
only
said
that
it
did
not
enlighten
you
well
sir
cried
the
queen
madame
the
passage
is
quite
clear
and
your
majesty
can
continue
your
in
fact
the
procession
arrived
in
safety
at
notre
dame
at
the
front
gate
of
which
all
the
clergy
with
the
coadjutor
at
their
head
awaited
the
king
the
queen
and
the
minister
for
whose
happy
return
they
chanted
a
te
deum
as
the
service
was
drawing
to
a
close
a
boy
entered
the
church
in
great
excitement
ran
to
the
sacristy
dressed
himself
quickly
in
the
choir
robes
and
cleaving
thanks
to
that
uniform
the
crowd
that
filled
the
temple
approached
bazin
who
clad
in
his
blue
robe
was
standing
gravely
in
his
place
at
the
entrance
to
the
choir
bazin
felt
some
one
pulling
his
sleeve
he
lowered
to
earth
his
eyes
beatifically
raised
to
heaven
and
recognized
friquet
well
you
rascal
what
is
it
how
do
you
dare
to
disturb
me
in
the
exercise
of
my
functions
asked
the
beadle
monsieur
bazin
said
friquet
monsieur
maillard
you
know
who
he
is
he
gives
holy
water
at
saint
eustache
well
go
well
he
received
in
the
scrimmage
a
sword
stroke
on
the
head
that
great
giant
who
was
there
gave
it
to
in
that
case
said
bazin
he
must
be
pretty
so
sick
that
he
is
dying
and
he
wants
to
confess
to
the
coadjutor
who
they
say
has
power
to
remit
great
and
does
he
imagine
that
the
coadjutor
will
put
himself
out
for
him
to
be
sure
the
coadjutor
has
who
told
you
that
monsieur
maillard
you
have
seen
him
then
certainly
i
was
there
when
he
what
were
you
doing
there
i
was
shouting
down
with
mazarin
death
to
the
cardinal
the
italian
to
the
gallows
isn
t
that
what
you
would
have
me
shout
be
quiet
you
rascal
said
bazin
looking
uneasily
around
so
that
he
told
me
that
poor
monsieur
maillard
go
find
the
coadjutor
friquet
and
if
you
bring
him
to
me
you
shall
be
my
say
then
father
bazin
the
heir
of
monsieur
maillard
the
giver
of
holy
water
at
saint
eustache
hey
i
shall
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
fold
my
arms
all
the
same
i
should
like
to
do
him
that
service
what
do
you
say
to
it
i
will
tell
the
coadjutor
said
bazin
in
fact
he
slowly
and
respectfully
approached
the
prelate
and
spoke
to
him
privately
a
few
words
to
which
the
latter
responded
by
an
affirmative
sign
he
then
returned
with
the
same
slow
step
and
said
go
and
tell
the
dying
man
that
he
must
be
patient
monseigneur
will

my
fortune
is
by
the
way
said
bazin
where
was
he
carried
to
the
tower
saint
jacques
la
boucherie
and
delighted
with
the
success
of
his
embassy
friquet
started
off
at
the
top
of
his
speed
when
the
te
deum
was
over
the
coadjutor
without
stopping
to
change
his
priestly
dress
took
his
way
toward
that
old
tower
which
he
knew
so
well
he
arrived
in
time
though
sinking
from
moment
to
moment
the
wounded
man
was
not
yet
dead
the
door
was
opened
to
the
coadjutor
of
the
room
in
which
the
mendicant
was
suffering
a
moment
later
friquet
went
out
carrying
in
his
hand
a
large
leather
bag
he
opened
it
as
soon
as
he
was
outside
the
chamber
and
to
his
great
astonishment
found
it
full
of
gold
the
mendicant
had
kept
his
word
and
made
friquet
his
heir
ah
mother
nanette
cried
friquet
suffocating
ah
mother
nanette
he
could
say
no
more
but
though
he
hadn
t
strength
to
speak
he
had
enough
for
action
he
rushed
headlong
to
the
street
and
like
the
greek
from
marathon
who
fell
in
the
square
at
athens
with
his
laurel
in
his
hand
friquet
reached
councillor
broussel
s
threshold
and
then
fell
exhausted
scattering
on
the
floor
the
louis
disgorged
by
his
leather
bag
mother
nanette
began
by
picking
up
the
louis
then
she
picked
up
friquet
in
the
meantime
the
cortege
returned
to
the
palais
royal
that
monsieur
d
artagnan
is
a
very
brave
man
mother
said
the
young
king
yes
my
son
and
he
rendered
very
important
services
to
your
father
treat
him
kindly
therefore
in
the
captain
said
the
young
king
to
d
artagnan
on
descending
from
the
carriage
the
queen
has
charged
me
to
invite
you
to
dinner
you
and
your
friend
the
baron
du
that
was
a
great
honor
for
d
artagnan
and
for
porthos
porthos
was
delighted
and
yet
during
the
entire
repast
he
seemed
to
be
preoccupied
what
was
the
matter
with
you
baron
d
artagnan
said
to
him
as
they
descended
the
staircase
of
the
palais
royal
you
seemed
at
dinner
to
be
anxious
about
i
was
trying
said
porthos
to
recall
where
i
had
seen
that
mendicant
whom
i
must
have
and
you
couldn
t
remember
well
search
my
friend
search
and
when
you
have
found
you
will
tell
me
will
you
not
pardieu
said
porthos
conclusion
on
going
home
the
two
friends
found
a
letter
from
athos
who
desired
them
to
meet
him
at
the
grand
charlemagne
on
the
following
day
the
friends
went
to
bed
early
but
neither
of
them
slept
when
we
arrive
at
the
summit
of
our
wishes
success
has
usually
the
power
to
drive
away
sleep
on
the
first
night
after
the
fulfilment
of
long
cherished
hopes
the
next
day
at
the
appointed
hour
they
went
to
see
athos
and
found
him
and
aramis
in
traveling
costume
what
cried
porthos
are
we
all
going
away
then
i
also
have
made
my
preparations
this
oh
heavens
yes
said
aramis
there
s
nothing
to
do
in
paris
now
there
s
no
fronde
the
duchess
de
longueville
has
invited
me
to
pass
a
few
days
in
normandy
and
has
deputed
me
while
her
son
is
being
baptized
to
go
and
prepare
her
residence
at
rouen
after
which
if
nothing
new
occurs
i
shall
go
and
bury
myself
in
my
convent
at
and
i
said
athos

returning
to
bragelonne
you
know
dear
d
artagnan
i
am
nothing
more
than
a
good
honest
country
gentleman
raoul
has
no
fortune
other
than
i
possess
poor
child
and
i
must
take
care
of
it
for
him
since
i
only
lend
him
my
and
raoul
what
shall
you
do
with
him
i
leave
him
with
you
my
friend
war
has
broken
out
in
flanders
you
shall
take
him
with
you
there
i
am
afraid
that
remaining
at
blois
would
be
dangerous
to
his
youthful
mind
take
him
and
teach
him
to
be
as
brave
and
loyal
as
you
are
then
replied
d
artagnan
though
i
shall
not
have
you
athos
at
all
events
i
shall
have
that
dear
head
by
me
and
though
he
s
but
a
boy
yet
since
your
soul
lives
again
in
him
dear
athos
i
shall
always
fancy
that
you
are
near
me
sustaining
and
encouraging
the
four
friends
embraced
with
tears
in
their
eyes
then
they
departed
without
knowing
whether
they
would
ever
see
each
other
again
d
artagnan
returned
to
the
rue
tiquetonne
with
porthos
still
possessed
by
the
wish
to
find
out
who
the
man
was
that
he
had
killed
on
arriving
at
the
hotel
de
la
chevrette
they
found
the
baron

mousqueton
the
two
friends
after
a
cordial
pressure
of
the
hands
separated
d
artagnan
was
standing
at
the
door
looking
after
porthos
with
a
mournful
gaze
when
the
baron
after
walking
scarcely
more
than
twenty
paces
returned
stood
still
struck
his
forehead
with
his
finger
and
exclaimed
i
recollect
what
inquired
d
artagnan
who
the
beggar
was
that
i
ah
indeed
and
who
was
he
twas
that
low
fellow
and
porthos
enchanted
at
having
relieved
his
mind
rejoined
mousqueton
and
they
disappeared
around
an
angle
of
the
street
d
artagnan
stood
for
an
instant
mute
pensive
and
motionless
then
as
he
went
in
he
saw
the
fair
madeleine
his
hostess
standing
on
the
threshold
madeleine
said
the
gascon
