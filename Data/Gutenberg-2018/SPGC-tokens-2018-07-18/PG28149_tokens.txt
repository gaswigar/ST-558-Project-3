her
ladyship
elephant
word
to
the
english
novelist
once
told
me
that
of
all
his
published
works
and
their
name
is
legion
one
only
had
been
founded
on
fact
and
that
one
his
critics
united
in
condemning
as
impossible
and
unnatural
in
the
case
of
my
own
little
book
i
venture
to
forestall
such
criticism
by
stating
that
while
the
characters
which
appear
in
its
pages
are
at
the
most
only
composite
photographs
the
one
impossible
and
unnatural
figure
the
elephant
had
his
foundation
in
actual
fact
and
the
history
of
its
acquirement
by
the
consul
as
hereinafter
set
forth
is
the
truthful
narration
of
an
actual
experience
one
of
many
episodes
stranger
than
fiction
which
went
to
form
the
warp
and
woof
of
my
diplomatic
dwight
chapter
i
in
which
the
same
question
is
answered
in
two
ways
harold
stanley
malcolm
hubart
scarsdale
of
the
towers
sussex
sat
uncomfortably
on
a
very
comfortable
chair
his
boots
were
manifestly
new
his
trousers
fresh
from
the
presser
his
waistcoat
immaculate
while
his
frock
coat
with
its
white
gardenia
and
his
delicate
grey
suede
gloves
completed
an
admirable
toilet
he
was
in
short
got
up
for
the
occasion
a
thoroughly
healthy
muscular
animal
too
fond
in
his
boyish
way
of
most
other
animals
and
enough
of
a
sportsman
to
find
no
pleasure
in
winging
tame
or
driven
grouse
and
pheasants
he
was
possessed
moreover
of
sufficient
brains
to
pass
with
credit
an
examination
which
gave
him
a
post
in
the
war
office
and
had
recently
become
owing
to
the
interposition
of
providence
and
a
restive
mare
the
eldest
son
in
spite
of
all
this
he
was
very
much
out
of
his
depth
as
he
sat
there
for
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
crisis
in
his
life
and
that
crisis
was
embodied
in
a
woman
and
such
a
woman
quite
unlike
anything
his
conservative
british
brain
had
ever
seen
or
imagined
before
the
present
london
season
a
mixture
of
parisian
daintiness
and
coquetry
nicely
tempered
by
breeding
and
common
sense
in
a
word
an
american
he
had
come
to
propose
to
her
or
rather
she
had
sent
for
him
to
what
end
he
hardly
knew
of
this
only
was
he
certain
that
she
had
turned
his
world
cast
down
his
conventional
gods
admired
him
for
what
he
considered
his
from
the
established
order
of
things
laughed
at
his
great
coups
cared
not
a
whit
for
his
most
valued
possessions
and
become
in
short
the
most
incomprehensible
bewitching
lovable
woman
on
earth
he
had
talked
to
her
about
the
weather
the
opera
the
court
ball
and
now
now
he
must
speak
to
her
of
his
love
unless
blessed
reprieve
she
spoke
first
which
she
did
now
scarsdale
she
remarked
i
have
not
sent
for
you
to
talk
amiable
society
nonsense
i
want
an
explanation
yes
miss
vernon
he
replied
nerving
himself
for
the
ordeal
why
did
you
propose
to
aunt
eliza
at
the
andersons
crush
last
night
because
he
faltered
well
really
you
see
she
is
your
only
relative
in
england
your
chaperon
and
it
is
customary
here
to
address
offers
of
marriage
to
the
head
of
the
family
i
really
do
see
why
you
want
to
marry
her
continued
his
tormentor
she
is
over
sixty
oh
you
need
be
shocked
aunt
eliza
is
not
sensitive
about
her
age
and
it
is
well
to
look
these
things
fairly
in
the
face
you
ca
honestly
call
her
handsome
though
she
is
a
dear
good
old
soul
but
i
fear
too
inured
to
chicago
to
assimilate
readily
with
english
society
of
course
her
private
means
are
enormous
good
heavens
miss
vernon
he
exclaimed
there
has
been
some
dreadful
mistake
i
entertain
the
highest
respect
for
your
aunt
miss
cogbill
but
i
do
wish
to
marry
her
i
wish
to
marry
somebody
else
really
why
do
you
propose
to
miss
somebody
else
in
person
then
it
is
usual
he
began
but
she
cut
him
short
exclaiming
oh
bother
excuse
me
i
did
mean
to
be
rude
but
really
you
know
any
girl
who
was
old
enough
to
marry
would
be
quite
capable
of
giving
you
your
answer
the
last
word
after
a
pause
for
consideration
was
accompanied
by
a
bewitching
if
ambiguous
smile
i
i
hope
you
are
not
offended
he
floundered
on
in
desperate
straits
by
this
time
oh
dear
no
she
returned
serenely
i
only
grieved
for
aunt
eliza
you
should
have
done
it
really
it
must
have
upset
her
dreadfully
she
too
old
for
that
sort
of
thing
do
tell
me
what
she
said
to
you
she
said
i
must
propose
on
my
own
account
he
blurted
out
and
that
she
could
not
pretend
to
advise
me
clever
aunt
eliza
murmured
miss
vernon
so
you
see
continued
her
lover
determined
to
have
it
over
and
know
the
worst
i
came
to
you
for
more
advice
she
queried
and
receiving
no
answer
continued
demurely
of
course
i
have
the
remotest
idea
whom
you
mean
to
honour
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
wives
of
englishmen
allow
themselves
to
be
treated
shamefully
and
i
once
made
out
a
list
of
objections
which
i
always
said
i
would
present
to
any
englishman
who
proposed
to
me
of
course
she
hastened
to
add
you
will
probably
marry
an
english
girl
who
wo
mind
i
have
said
so
he
interjected
no
she
said
meditatively
you
have
i
tell
you
what
they
are
if
you
wish
do
he
begged
well
in
the
first
place
she
continued
i
should
refuse
to
be
a
oh
i
say
he
began
but
she
went
on
unheeding
his
expostulation
then
my
husband
could
beat
me
not
even
once
though
the
law
allows
it
what
do
you
take
us
for
he
exclaimed
then
she
proceeded
he
would
have
to
love
me
better
than
his
horses
and
his
dogs
oh
i
say
mabel
he
burst
out
teased
beyond
all
limits
of
endurance
do
chaff
me
i
awfully
in
earnest
you
know
and
if
you
will
accept
what
little
i
have
to
offer
three
thousand
a
year
and
towers
now
poor
bob
gone
he
paused
but
she
made
no
answer
only
he
noticed
that
all
of
a
sudden
she
had
become
very
serious
lady
mary
my
mother
you
know
would
of
course
leave
the
place
to
you
at
once
but
there
no
title
my
father
was
only
a
knight
sorry
oh
she
replied
i
would
have
married
you
if
you
had
had
one
quite
enough
of
my
countrywomen
have
made
fools
of
themselves
on
that
account
then
you
will
marry
me
he
cried
and
sprang
towards
her
she
saw
her
slip
and
tried
to
correct
it
i
have
said
she
began
but
the
sentence
was
never
finished
for
harold
stanley
malcolm
hubart
scarsdale
of
the
towers
sussex
closed
the
argument
and
the
lips
of
miss
mabel
vernon
of
chicago
illinois
at
one
and
the
same
time
robert
allingford
united
states
consul
at
christchurch
england
and
marion
youngest
daughter
of
sir
peter
and
lady
steele
were
seated
on
the
balcony
of
the
hyde
park
club
one
hot
afternoon
everybody
had
gone
down
to
the
races
at
goodwood
and
the
season
was
drawing
its
last
gasp
the
row
which
they
overlooked
was
almost
deserted
save
for
an
occasional
depressed
brougham
while
the
stretches
of
the
park
beyond
were
given
over
to
nursemaids
and
their
attendant
tommies
and
bobbies
mamma
was
there
of
course
one
must
be
conventional
in
london
even
in
july
but
she
was
talking
to
the
other
man
jack
carrington
who
had
been
invited
especially
for
that
purpose
and
was
doing
his
duty
nobly
the
afternoon
tea
had
been
cleared
away
and
the
balcony
was
deserted
in
another
week
marion
would
go
into
the
country
and
he
would
return
to
his
consulate
he
might
never
have
such
another
chance
opportunities
for
a
proposal
are
so
rare
in
london
that
it
does
not
do
to
miss
them
a
ball
affords
almost
the
only
opening
and
when
one
remembers
the
offers
to
which
one
has
been
a
third
party
on
the
other
side
of
a
thin
paper
screen
well
it
makes
a
man
cautious
robert
allingford
had
planned
and
worked
up
this
tea
with
patience
and
success
jack
was
to
be
best
man
in
consideration
of
his
devotion
to
mamma
provided
of
course
that
the
services
of
a
best
man
should
be
required
on
this
point
allingford
was
doubtful
he
was
sure
that
lady
steele
understood
he
knew
that
sir
peter
had
smiled
on
him
indulgently
for
the
past
fortnight
his
friends
chaffed
him
about
it
openly
at
dinners
and
at
the
club
but
marion
he
was
very
far
from
certain
if
she
comprehended
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
slightest
degree
he
had
given
her
dinners
flowers
candy
in
short
paid
her
every
possible
attention
but
then
she
expected
americans
to
do
so
it
was
just
their
way
and
did
mean
anything
he
greatly
feared
that
his
proposal
would
be
a
shock
to
her
and
english
girls
he
had
been
told
did
not
like
shocks
he
wondered
if
it
would
have
been
better
to
ask
lady
steele
for
her
daughter
hand
but
this
he
felt
was
beyond
him
proposing
was
bad
enough
anyway
but
to
attempt
a
declaration
in
cold
blood
he
simply
could
moreover
he
felt
that
it
must
be
now
or
never
jack
had
been
giving
him
the
field
for
five
minutes
already
and
he
had
not
even
made
a
beginning
he
would
go
in
and
get
it
over
you
are
leaving
town
next
week
he
said
i
shall
miss
you
you
have
been
very
good
to
me
she
replied
simply
good
to
myself
you
mean
it
is
the
greatest
pleasure
i
have
in
life
to
give
you
pleasure
marion
mr
allingford
she
said
half
rising
he
had
used
her
christian
name
for
the
first
time
forgive
me
if
i
call
you
marion
he
went
on
noting
with
relief
that
her
ladyship
was
talking
charity
bazaar
to
jack
and
so
assuring
him
from
interruption
i
mean
give
me
the
right
to
do
so
you
see
i
awfully
in
love
with
you
i
ca
help
loving
the
sweetest
girl
i
know
you
must
have
seen
how
i
cared
lately
yes
i
have
suspected
it
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
do
you
mind
i
ca
help
it
if
you
do
i
love
you
anyway
but
i
want
you
to
be
my
wife
to
care
for
me
just
a
little
i
do
ask
more
i
think
you
must
speak
to
mamma
but
i
do
wish
i
mean
ca
you
give
me
something
to
go
on
some
assurance
she
blushed
and
looked
down
repeating
the
phrase
i
think
you
must
speak
to
mamma
is
that
equivalent
he
began
then
he
saw
that
it
was
and
added
my
darling
her
head
sank
lower
he
had
her
hand
in
a
moment
and
wondered
if
he
might
venture
to
kiss
her
screened
as
they
both
were
by
her
sunshade
but
hesitated
to
do
so
because
of
the
ominous
silence
at
the
other
end
of
the
balcony
if
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
this
evening
said
lady
voice
to
him
come
to
us
sir
peter
and
i
are
dining
at
home
and
if
you
will
partake
of
a
family
dinner
with
us
we
shall
be
delighted
he
bowed
his
acceptance
come
marion
her
ladyship
continued
we
have
spent
a
charming
afternoon
allingford
thanks
to
your
hospitality
we
are
at
home
on
thursdays
after
september
carrington
you
must
come
and
hear
more
about
my
bazaar
and
they
were
gone
jack
stepped
to
the
bell
well
bob
he
said
to
allingford
is
it
brandy
and
soda
or
champagne
champagne
replied
that
gentleman
then
remarked
carrington
after
ordering
a
bottle
of
perrier
then
bob
my
boy
let
me
congratulate
you
i
think
i
deserve
it
he
replied
as
he
wrung
his
friend
hand
for
i
believe
i
have
won
for
my
wife
the
most
charming
girl
in
london
i
am
awfully
glad
for
you
said
carrington
and
i
consider
her
a
very
lucky
young
woman
i
do
know
about
that
returned
allingford
and
i
sure
i
see
what
she
can
find
to
care
for
in
me
why
we
hardly
know
each
other
i
only
met
her
in
public
and
not
over
a
couple
of
dozen
times
at
that
oh
you
will
find
it
much
more
fun
becoming
acquainted
after
you
are
engaged
our
english
conventions
are
beautifully
chinese
in
some
respects
allingford
laughed
saying
i
do
know
that
i
going
to
be
engaged
i
ca
imagine
why
her
family
should
approve
of
the
match
i
have
a
title
and
never
can
have
and
i
only
in
consular
service
now
if
i
had
been
a
diplomat
my
dear
fellow
said
carrington
you
seem
to
forget
that
you
have
a
few
dozen
at
your
disposal
and
a
larger
income
than
you
can
conveniently
spend
her
people
have
forgotten
it
however
as
i
venture
to
prophesy
that
you
find
out
before
morning
as
for
your
being
an
american
and
a
consul
that
does
count
just
make
the
settlements
sufficiently
large
and
as
long
as
you
do
eat
with
your
knife
or
drink
out
of
your
they
will
pardon
the
rest
as
amiable
eccentricities
you
are
a
cynic
carrington
and
i
do
believe
it
said
allingford
rising
to
go
anyway
what
do
you
know
about
marriage
nothing
and
i
am
not
likely
to
rejoined
his
friend
but
i
lived
in
london
the
dinner
that
night
at
belgrave
square
did
not
serve
to
put
the
consul
at
his
ease
true
he
sat
by
marion
but
no
word
was
spoken
of
what
had
passed
that
afternoon
and
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
in
an
anomalous
position
he
had
on
his
company
manners
and
was
not
at
his
best
in
consequence
he
felt
he
was
being
watched
and
would
be
criticised
in
the
after
dinner
which
made
him
nervous
sir
peter
had
several
married
daughters
one
of
whom
was
present
and
allingford
wondered
how
their
husbands
had
behaved
under
similar
circumstances
he
gave
lady
steele
at
whose
right
he
sat
ample
opportunity
to
question
him
concerning
his
family
history
and
future
plans
and
prospects
a
chance
of
which
she
was
not
slow
to
avail
herself
when
the
ladies
had
departed
and
had
left
the
two
gentlemen
to
their
coffee
and
cigars
sir
peter
lost
no
time
in
opening
the
question
and
said
somewhat
bluntly
so
i
hear
that
you
wish
to
marry
my
daughter
the
consul
signified
that
such
was
the
case
i
sure
i
do
know
why
resumed
her
father
with
true
british
candour
i
become
so
used
to
my
children
that
i
sometimes
wonder
what
other
people
can
see
in
them
marion
is
a
good
little
girl
however
i
say
that
for
her
a
good
little
girl
and
not
extravagant
sir
peter
manner
was
reassuring
and
allingford
hastened
to
say
that
he
was
sensible
of
the
great
honour
miss
steele
had
done
him
in
considering
his
suit
and
that
he
should
strive
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
her
i
do
doubt
it
my
dear
fellow
i
do
doubt
it
and
the
baronet
paused
smiling
so
amiably
that
the
consul
was
disconcerted
and
began
to
fear
an
unpleasant
surprise
i
trust
he
returned
that
you
are
not
averse
to
me
as
a
personally
much
the
reverse
but
i
always
ask
the
man
who
comes
to
me
as
you
have
done
one
question
and
on
his
answer
i
base
my
approval
or
disapproval
of
his
suit
and
that
question
is
can
you
support
a
wife
mr
allingford
as
a
gentleman
i
could
not
have
asked
her
hand
if
such
were
not
the
case
ah
replied
sir
peter
that
is
quite
right
as
for
my
position
continued
the
young
man
you
hold
a
public
office
in
the
service
of
your
country
i
consider
that
sufficient
guarantee
of
your
position
both
moral
and
social
allingford
who
knew
something
of
american
practical
politics
thought
this
by
no
means
followed
but
forbore
to
say
so
and
sir
peter
continued
have
you
any
family
no
relations
in
the
world
except
my
younger
brother
dick
who
manages
the
property
at
home
while
i
play
at
politics
abroad
i
see
said
his
host
one
question
more
and
i
have
done
i
dislike
talking
business
after
dinner
it
should
be
left
to
the
lawyers
but
seeing
that
you
are
an
american
and
do
not
understand
such
things
i
thought
the
consul
stopped
him
by
a
gesture
you
are
referring
to
the
settlements
sir
peter
he
said
set
your
mind
at
rest
on
that
score
i
do
the
proper
thing
of
course
my
dear
fellow
of
course
i
do
doubt
that
for
a
moment
but
er
you
wo
think
me
mercenary
if
i
ask
you
to
be
in
short
more
definite
i
speak
most
disinterestedly
purely
out
of
consideration
for
my
daughter
future
allingford
frowned
slightly
as
carrington
prophecy
came
back
to
him
his
prospective
was
quite
within
his
rights
in
speaking
as
he
did
but
why
could
he
have
left
it
at
least
till
would
a
do
he
said
looking
up
i
give
her
a
really
i
do
know
what
to
say
replied
sir
peter
in
some
perplexity
i
quite
ignorant
of
such
matters
are
er
valuable
the
one
i
thinking
of
has
been
worth
a
quarter
of
a
million
since
it
started
and
we
have
only
begun
to
work
it
replied
the
consul
bless
my
soul
ejaculated
his
host
you
do
say
so
do
you
go
in
much
for
that
sort
of
thing
yes
i
quite
a
number
dear
me
said
sir
peter
dreamily
a
quarter
of
a
million
then
waking
up
he
added
but
i
forgetting
the
time
my
dear
allingford
er
your
christian
name
escapes
me
robert
sir
peter
thanks
i
was
going
to
say
my
dear
robert
that
you
must
go
upstairs
and
see
mamma
chapter
ii
in
which
the
consul
loses
a
relative
and
gains
a
wife
when
robert
allingford
entered
the
of
his
club
one
afternoon
early
in
october
he
was
genuinely
glad
to
find
that
it
had
but
one
occupant
and
that
he
was
harold
scarsdale
the
two
men
had
met
each
other
for
the
first
time
at
a
some
eighteen
months
before
and
their
acquaintance
had
ripened
into
true
friendship
hello
he
cried
accosting
that
gentleman
you
enjoying
to
the
full
your
last
hours
of
bachelor
bliss
i
see
speak
for
yourself
replied
scarsdale
who
looked
extremely
bored
you
also
on
the
dizzy
brink
it
a
fact
admitted
the
consul
we
are
both
to
be
married
but
that
is
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
make
the
most
of
our
remaining
freedom
you
look
as
glum
as
if
you
lost
your
last
friend
come
cheer
up
and
have
something
to
drink
they
say
remarked
the
englishman
as
he
acquiesced
in
the
suggestion
that
a
man
only
needs
to
be
married
to
find
out
of
how
little
importance
he
really
is
but
i
been
anticipating
my
fate
miss
vernon
rooms
are
a
wilderness
of
the
vanities
of
life
and
here
i
am
banished
to
the
club
as
a
stern
reality
quite
so
replied
the
american
i
in
the
same
box
the
dressmakers
have
driven
me
clean
out
of
belgrave
square
but
you
you
really
have
my
sympathy
for
you
are
to
marry
one
of
my
countrywomen
and
they
are
apt
to
prove
rather
exacting
mistresses
at
times
like
these
oh
i
fairly
well
treated
said
scarsdale
much
better
than
i
deserve
i
dare
say
how
is
it
with
you
oh
laughed
allingford
i
feel
as
if
i
were
playing
a
game
of
blind
man
buff
with
english
conventionalities
at
least
i
seem
to
run
foul
of
them
most
of
the
time
i
used
to
imagine
that
getting
married
was
a
comparatively
simple
matter
but
what
with
a
highly
complicated
ceremony
and
an
irresponsible
best
man
my
cup
of
misery
is
overflowing
i
suppose
you
have
been
doing
your
required
fifteen
days
of
residence
in
the
parish
london
is
slow
work
now
every
one
is
out
of
town
remarked
scarsdale
my
has
been
residing
for
the
past
fortnight
in
an
adjacent
attic
in
fulfilment
of
the
law
returned
the
american
but
affairs
at
the
consulate
have
kept
me
on
post
more
than
i
could
have
wished
i
should
not
think
you
would
have
much
business
at
this
season
of
the
year
on
the
contrary
it
is
just
the
time
when
the
migratory
american
who
has
spent
the
summer
in
doing
europe
returns
to
england
dead
broke
and
expects
nay
demands
to
be
helped
home
do
you
have
many
cases
of
that
sort
lots
in
fact
one
especially
importunate
fellow
nearly
caused
me
to
lose
my
train
for
london
yesterday
i
gave
him
what
he
asked
to
get
rid
of
him
i
suppose
that
sort
of
thing
is
a
good
deal
like
throwing
money
into
the
sea
said
scarsdale
it
never
comes
back
not
often
i
regret
to
say
but
in
this
case
my
distressed
countryman
put
up
collateral
indeed
i
trust
you
can
realise
on
it
if
need
be
i
do
think
i
want
to
said
the
consul
seeing
it
an
elephant
what
cried
scarsdale
an
elephant
or
rather
to
be
exact
an
order
for
one
to
be
delivered
by
the
nubian
and
red
sea
line
of
freighters
in
two
or
three
days
at
southampton
docks
my
friend
promises
to
redeem
it
before
arrival
expects
advices
from
the
states
but
meanwhile
is
terribly
hard
up
i
hope
he
will
be
true
to
his
promises
otherwise
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
elephant
you
might
give
it
to
lady
steele
suggested
scarsdale
yes
i
think
i
can
see
it
tethered
to
the
railings
in
belgrave
square
remarked
the
consul
but
i
am
not
losing
sleep
on
that
account
for
though
i
informed
the
steamship
people
that
i
am
temporarily
the
owner
of
the
beast
i
more
than
suspect
that
the
order
and
the
elephant
are
both
myths
but
i
have
been
telling
you
of
my
affairs
long
enough
how
go
yours
swimmingly
replied
the
englishman
miss
vernon
has
only
one
relative
in
england
thank
heaven
but
my
family
have
settled
down
on
me
in
swarms
is
lady
diana
melton
in
town
for
the
occasion
asked
allingford
scarsdale
flushed
and
for
the
moment
did
not
reply
i
beg
your
pardon
said
the
american
if
i
have
asked
an
unfortunate
question
not
at
all
replied
his
friend
my
who
as
you
know
is
a
somewhat
determined
old
person
has
the
bad
taste
to
dislike
americans
so
she
has
confined
herself
to
a
frigid
refusal
of
our
wedding
invitation
and
sent
an
impossible
spoon
to
the
bride
so
you
are
not
to
have
her
country
place
for
your
honeymoon
said
allingford
from
what
i
have
heard
of
melton
court
it
would
be
quite
an
ideal
spot
under
the
circumstances
no
we
are
not
going
there
the
fact
is
i
do
know
where
we
are
going
added
scarsdale
really
yes
as
you
were
saying
just
now
your
countrywomen
are
apt
to
prove
exacting
and
the
future
scarsdale
has
taken
it
into
her
head
that
i
am
much
too
prosaic
to
plan
a
wedding
trip
that
i
would
do
the
usual
round
in
fact
and
that
she
would
be
bored
in
consequence
so
she
has
taken
the
arrangements
upon
herself
and
the
whole
thing
is
to
be
a
surprise
for
me
i
do
even
know
the
station
from
which
we
start
i
afraid
i
ca
commiserate
you
returned
allingford
laughing
for
i
guilty
of
doing
the
very
same
thing
myself
and
my
bride
elect
has
no
idea
of
our
destination
she
spends
most
of
her
spare
time
in
trying
to
guess
it
at
this
moment
a
card
was
handed
to
allingford
who
said
why
here
is
my
best
man
jack
carrington
you
know
him
do
you
i
wonder
what
can
have
started
him
on
my
trail
and
he
requested
the
page
to
show
him
up
a
moment
later
carrington
entered
the
room
he
was
one
of
the
most
young
men
in
london
the
friend
of
every
one
who
knew
him
a
thoroughly
delightful
and
irresponsible
creature
however
there
was
a
seriousness
about
his
face
that
proclaimed
his
mission
to
be
of
no
very
pleasant
character
after
greeting
his
friends
he
asked
for
a
few
words
in
private
with
his
principal
and
as
a
result
of
this
colloquy
allingford
excused
himself
to
scardsdale
saying
that
he
must
return
to
his
lodgings
at
once
as
carrington
had
brought
him
news
that
his
brother
dick
had
arrived
unexpectedly
from
america
and
was
awaiting
him
there
what
a
delightful
surprise
for
you
exclaimed
scarsdale
yes
very
of
course
returned
allingford
drily
and
after
a
mutual
interchange
of
congratulations
on
the
events
of
the
morrow
and
regrets
that
neither
could
be
at
the
wedding
of
the
other
the
consul
and
his
best
man
left
the
club
he
did
not
seem
at
carrington
news
mused
scarsdale
and
then
his
mind
turned
to
his
own
affairs
it
was
not
astonishing
that
robert
allingford
received
the
news
of
his
brother
arrival
without
any
show
of
rejoicing
a
family
skeleton
is
never
an
enjoyable
possession
but
when
it
is
not
even
decently
interred
but
very
much
alive
and
in
the
shape
of
a
brother
who
has
attained
notoriety
as
a
black
sheep
of
an
unusually
intense
dye
it
may
be
looked
upon
as
little
less
than
a
curse
yet
there
were
redeeming
qualities
about
dick
allingford
in
spite
of
his
thoroughly
bad
name
he
was
one
of
the
most
and
engaging
of
men
while
the
way
in
which
he
had
managed
his
own
and
his
brother
property
left
nothing
to
be
desired
moreover
he
was
quite
in
his
element
among
his
miners
indeed
his
qualities
good
and
bad
were
of
a
kind
that
endeared
him
to
them
he
loved
the
good
things
of
this
life
however
in
a
wholly
uncontrollable
manner
and
as
his
income
afforded
almost
unlimited
scope
for
these
desires
his
achievements
would
have
put
most
novels
to
the
blush
dick
redeeming
virtue
was
a
blind
devotion
to
his
elder
brother
from
whom
he
demanded
unlimited
advice
and
assistance
in
extricating
him
from
a
scrapes
and
inexhaustible
patience
and
forgiveness
for
those
peccadilloes
when
robert
had
taken
a
public
office
in
england
it
was
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
richard
should
confine
his
attentions
to
america
and
so
far
he
had
not
violated
the
contract
the
consul
had
taken
care
that
his
brother
should
not
be
informed
of
the
day
of
his
marriage
until
it
was
too
late
for
him
to
attend
in
person
for
he
shuddered
to
think
of
the
rig
that
richard
would
run
in
staid
and
conventional
english
society
accordingly
he
hastened
to
his
lodgings
full
of
anxious
on
arrival
his
worst
fears
were
fulfilled
dick
received
him
with
open
arms
very
affectionate
very
penitent
and
very
drunk
from
that
gentleman
somewhat
disconnected
description
the
consul
obtained
a
lurid
inkling
of
what
seemed
to
have
been
a
triumphal
progress
of
unrestrained
dissipation
from
southampton
to
london
of
which
indignant
barmaids
and
a
wrecked
formed
the
most
redeeming
features
now
explain
yourself
cried
robert
in
wrath
at
the
conclusion
of
his
brother
recital
what
do
you
mean
by
this
disgraceful
conduct
and
why
are
you
in
england
at
all
saw
marriage
newspaper
hiccoughed
dick
took
first
steamer
what
did
you
come
for
demanded
allingford
sternly
come
congratulate
you
see
the
bride
not
on
your
life
exclaimed
the
consul
you
are
beastly
drunk
and
not
fit
for
decent
society
fault
railroad
company
bad
whisky
explained
the
unregenerate
one
i
take
your
word
for
it
replied
his
brother
you
ought
to
be
a
judge
of
whisky
but
you
wo
go
to
my
wedding
unless
you
are
sober
and
he
rang
for
his
valet
this
is
my
brother
parsons
he
remarked
to
that
individual
when
he
entered
you
may
put
him
to
bed
at
once
use
my
room
for
the
purpose
and
engage
another
for
me
for
yes
sir
replied
his
valet
who
was
too
well
trained
to
betray
any
emotion
when
you
have
got
him
settled
continued
the
consul
lock
him
in
and
let
him
stay
till
morning
with
which
he
straightway
departed
leaving
his
stupefied
brother
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
shocked
and
sedate
parsons
allingford
stood
a
good
deal
in
awe
of
his
valet
and
dreaded
to
see
the
reproachful
look
of
outraged
dignity
which
he
knew
would
greet
him
on
his
return
so
he
again
sought
the
club
intending
to
find
scarsdale
and
continue
their
conversation
but
that
gentleman
had
departed
and
the
consul
was
forced
to
console
himself
with
a
brandy
and
soda
and
settle
down
to
a
quiet
hour
of
reflection
he
had
been
engaged
upwards
of
three
months
and
it
is
needless
to
say
had
learned
much
in
that
space
of
time
an
engagement
is
a
liberal
education
to
any
man
for
it
presents
a
series
of
entirely
new
problems
to
be
solved
he
ceases
to
think
of
and
for
himself
alone
and
the
accuracy
with
which
he
can
adjust
himself
to
these
novel
conditions
determines
the
success
or
failure
of
his
married
life
robert
allingford
however
was
engaged
to
a
woman
of
another
nation
of
his
own
race
indeed
and
speaking
his
own
tongue
but
educated
under
widely
differing
standards
and
ideals
and
on
a
plane
of
comparative
simplicity
when
viewed
in
the
light
of
her
complex
american
sister
the
little
english
girl
was
an
endless
mystery
to
him
and
it
was
only
in
later
life
that
he
discovered
that
he
was
constantly
endowing
her
with
a
complicated
nature
which
she
did
not
possess
he
could
not
understand
a
woman
who
generally
i
do
not
say
invariably
for
marion
steele
was
human
after
all
but
who
generally
meant
what
she
said
whose
pleasures
were
healthy
and
direct
and
who
was
really
simple
and
genuinely
ignorant
of
most
things
pertaining
to
the
world
worldly
he
knew
that
world
well
enough
ten
years
of
mining
had
taught
him
that
and
he
had
been
left
to
its
tender
mercies
when
still
a
boy
with
no
relatives
except
his
younger
brother
who
as
may
well
be
imagined
was
rather
a
burden
than
a
help
but
if
robert
allingford
had
seen
the
rough
side
of
life
it
had
taught
him
to
understand
human
nature
and
as
he
had
been
blessed
with
a
large
heart
and
a
considerable
measure
of
adaptability
he
managed
to
get
on
very
well
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
true
he
seldom
appreciated
what
the
british
mind
held
to
contain
worth
but
he
was
tolerant
and
his
tolerance
begat
unconsciously
sympathy
on
the
other
hand
the
consul
was
as
much
of
a
mystery
to
his
fiancée
as
she
had
ever
been
to
him
in
her
eyes
he
was
always
doing
the
unexpected
for
one
thing
she
never
knew
when
to
take
him
seriously
and
was
afraid
of
what
he
might
do
or
say
but
she
soon
learned
to
trust
him
implicitly
and
to
estimate
him
at
his
true
sterling
worth
in
short
both
had
partially
adjusted
themselves
to
each
other
and
were
likely
to
live
very
happily
with
enough
of
the
unknown
in
their
characters
to
keep
them
from
becoming
bored
allingford
had
never
spoken
definitely
to
his
fiancée
concerning
his
younger
brother
and
she
knew
instinctively
that
it
was
a
subject
to
be
avoided
to
her
father
she
had
said
something
but
sir
peter
had
little
interest
in
his
affairs
beyond
seeing
that
they
were
suitably
married
and
since
he
was
satisfied
with
the
settlements
and
the
man
was
content
to
leave
well
enough
alone
the
consul
therefore
thought
himself
justified
in
saying
nothing
about
the
unexpected
arrival
of
his
brother
especially
as
the
chances
of
that
gentleman
being
in
a
fit
state
to
appear
at
the
wedding
seemed
highly
problematical
next
morning
there
were
no
signs
of
repentance
or
of
dick
for
if
a
deserted
bed
an
open
window
and
the
smashed
glass
of
a
neighbouring
skylight
signified
anything
it
was
that
richard
allingford
was
still
unregenerate
and
at
large
the
bridal
day
dawned
bright
and
clear
and
carrington
lunched
with
the
consul
just
before
the
ceremony
which
thanks
to
english
law
took
place
at
that
most
impossible
hour
of
the
day
the
bridegroom
floundered
through
the
intricacies
of
the
service
signed
his
name
in
the
vestry
and
achieved
his
carriage
in
a
kind
of
dream
but
woke
up
sufficiently
to
the
realities
of
life
at
the
reception
to
endure
with
fortitude
the
indiscriminate
kissing
of
scores
of
new
relations
then
he
drank
his
own
health
and
the
healths
of
other
people
and
at
last
escaped
upstairs
to
prepare
for
the
journey
and
have
a
quiet
fifteen
minutes
with
his
best
man
now
remember
he
said
to
that
irresponsible
individual
you
are
the
only
one
who
knows
our
destination
this
evening
and
if
you
breathe
it
to
a
soul
i
come
back
and
murder
you
my
dear
fellow
replied
carrington
you
do
suppose
after
endured
weeks
of
and
inquisitorial
advances
from
the
bride
and
her
family
that
i
am
going
to
strike
my
colours
and
give
the
whole
thing
away
at
the
eleventh
hour
you
have
been
a
trump
jack
rejoined
the
consul
and
i
only
wish
you
may
be
as
happy
some
time
as
i
am
it
is
your
day
do
worry
about
my
affairs
returned
carrington
with
a
forced
laugh
which
gave
colour
to
the
popular
report
that
the
only
vulnerable
point
in
his
armour
of
good
nature
lay
in
his
impecunious
condition
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
his
marrying
on
his
own
account
it
was
only
a
passing
cloud
however
and
he
hastened
to
change
the
subject
saying
come
you
are
late
already
and
a
bride
must
not
be
kept
waiting
allingford
was
thereupon
hustled
downstairs
and
wept
upon
from
all
quarters
and
his
life
was
threatened
with
rice
and
old
shoes
but
he
reached
the
street
somehow
with
robert
in
tow
and
barring
the
circumstance
that
in
his
agitation
he
had
embraced
the
butler
instead
of
sir
peter
he
acquitted
himself
very
well
under
the
trying
ordeal
as
they
drove
to
the
station
his
wife
was
strangely
quiet
and
he
rallied
her
on
the
fact
why
he
said
you
have
spoken
since
we
started
her
face
grew
troubled
i
was
wondering
she
began
if
you
would
be
happy
he
asked
i
do
my
best
no
no
i
sure
of
that
only
do
tell
me
where
we
are
going
the
consul
laughed
you
women
are
just
the
same
all
the
world
over
he
replied
but
otherwise
did
not
commit
himself
but
his
wife
noticed
that
he
looked
worried
and
anxious
and
that
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
unmistakable
relief
as
their
train
drew
out
of
waterloo
station
she
did
not
know
that
the
one
cloud
which
he
had
feared
might
darken
his
wedding
day
had
now
been
dispelled
he
had
seen
nothing
of
his
brother
chapter
iii
in
which
the
london
and
south
western
accomplishes
what
the
marriage
service
forbids
it
might
be
supposed
that
the
heir
to
the
towers
and
lady
very
considerable
property
would
meet
with
some
decided
opposition
from
his
family
to
his
proposed
alliance
with
mabel
vernon
an
unknown
american
who
though
fairly
provided
with
this
world
goods
could
in
no
sense
be
termed
a
great
heiress
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
the
prejudices
of
his
own
people
were
as
nothing
when
compared
with
those
of
aunt
eliza
in
the
first
place
she
did
not
wish
her
niece
to
marry
at
all
on
the
ground
that
no
man
was
good
enough
for
her
and
in
the
second
place
she
had
decided
that
if
mabel
must
have
a
partner
in
life
he
was
to
be
born
under
the
stars
and
stripes
her
wrath
therefore
was
great
when
she
heard
of
the
engagement
and
she
declared
that
she
had
a
good
mind
to
cut
the
young
couple
off
with
a
cent
a
threat
that
meant
something
from
a
woman
who
had
bought
corner
lots
in
chicago
immediately
after
the
great
fire
and
still
held
them
scarsdale
never
forgot
his
first
interview
with
her
after
she
had
learned
the
news
i
mistrusted
you
were
round
for
no
good
she
said
though
i
quite
certain
which
one
of
us
you
wanted
he
bit
his
lip
there
nothing
to
laugh
at
young
man
she
continued
severely
marrying
me
would
have
been
no
joke
i
sure
miss
cogbill
began
scarsdale
you
call
me
aunt
eliza
in
the
future
she
broke
in
that
is
who
i
am
and
if
i
choose
to
remember
your
wife
when
i
gone
she
be
as
rich
as
a
duchess
as
i
dare
say
you
know
i
had
no
thought
of
your
leaving
her
anything
and
i
am
quite
able
to
support
her
without
your
assistance
he
replied
nettled
by
her
implication
i
am
glad
to
hear
it
it
sounds
encouraging
returned
the
aunt
tell
me
have
you
ever
done
anything
to
support
yourself
rather
as
a
younger
son
i
should
have
had
a
very
poor
chance
if
not
how
many
towers
have
you
got
was
her
next
question
i
do
know
said
scarsdale
laughing
at
her
very
literal
interpretation
of
the
name
of
his
estate
have
they
i
afraid
not
he
replied
but
you
must
come
and
see
for
yourself
my
mother
will
be
happy
to
welcome
you
no
i
guess
not
i
too
old
to
start
climbing
oh
you
would
have
to
live
in
them
he
hastened
to
assure
her
there
are
other
parts
to
the
house
and
my
mother
that
her
ladyship
yes
you
are
sure
you
have
any
title
asked
aunt
eliza
suspiciously
no
nor
any
chance
of
having
one
well
i
do
feel
relieved
she
commented
the
psalms
say
not
to
put
your
trust
in
princes
but
i
guess
if
king
david
had
ever
been
through
a
london
season
he
would
have
drawn
the
line
there
and
what
good
enough
for
him
is
good
enough
for
me
i
think
you
can
trust
me
aunt
eliza
i
hope
so
though
i
never
expected
to
see
a
niece
of
mine
married
to
a
man
of
war
not
a
man
of
war
he
corrected
only
a
man
in
the
war
office
a
very
different
thing
i
assure
you
i
am
rejoiced
to
hear
it
she
replied
now
run
along
to
mabel
and
i
write
your
mother
and
tell
her
that
i
guess
you
do
which
she
straightway
did
and
that
letter
is
still
preserved
as
one
of
the
literary
curiosities
of
the
towers
sussex
the
first
meeting
of
aunt
eliza
and
lady
scarsdale
took
place
the
day
before
the
wedding
it
was
pleasant
short
and
to
the
point
and
at
its
conclusion
each
parted
from
the
other
with
mingled
feelings
of
wonder
and
respect
indeed
no
one
could
fail
to
respect
miss
cogbill
alone
and
unaided
she
had
amassed
and
managed
a
great
fortune
she
was
shrewd
and
keen
beyond
the
nature
of
women
and
seldom
minced
matters
in
her
speech
but
nevertheless
she
was
possessed
of
much
native
refinement
and
prim
courtesy
that
did
not
always
seem
in
accordance
with
the
business
side
of
her
nature
as
time
went
on
she
became
reconciled
to
scarsdale
but
his
lack
of
appreciation
of
business
was
a
thorn
in
her
flesh
and
indeed
her
inclinations
had
led
her
in
quite
another
direction
now
look
at
that
young
carrington
who
comes
to
see
you
once
in
a
while
if
you
had
to
marry
an
englishman
why
did
you
take
him
she
said
once
to
her
niece
why
aunt
eliza
replied
that
young
lady
what
are
you
thinking
of
according
to
your
own
standards
he
is
much
less
desirable
than
harold
for
he
has
not
a
cent
he
make
money
fast
enough
if
his
training
did
get
in
his
way
she
retorted
which
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
your
future
husband
the
wedding
was
very
quiet
at
miss
vernon
suggestion
and
with
her
aunt
approval
for
neither
of
them
cared
for
that
lavish
display
with
which
a
certain
class
of
americans
are
unfortunately
associated
there
was
to
be
a
reception
at
the
hotel
to
which
a
large
number
of
people
had
been
asked
but
at
the
ceremony
scarcely
a
dozen
were
present
scarsdale
mother
and
immediate
family
a
brother
official
who
served
as
best
man
and
aunt
eliza
made
up
the
party
at
the
bride
request
the
service
had
been
as
much
abbreviated
as
the
church
would
allow
and
the
whole
matter
was
finished
in
a
surprisingly
short
space
of
time
the
reception
followed
and
an
hour
later
the
happy
pair
were
ready
to
leave
but
their
destination
was
still
a
mystery
to
the
groom
i
think
you
might
just
give
me
a
hint
he
suggested
to
aunt
eliza
whom
he
shrewdly
suspected
knew
all
about
it
do
you
she
replied
well
i
think
that
mabel
is
quite
capable
of
taking
care
of
herself
and
you
too
and
that
the
sooner
you
realise
it
the
better
as
for
your
being
consulted
or
informed
about
your
wedding
trip
why
my
niece
has
been
four
times
round
the
world
already
and
is
better
able
to
plan
an
ordinary
honeymoon
excursion
than
a
man
who
spends
his
time
turning
out
bombs
and
and
monitors
and
things
aunt
eliza
notions
of
the
duties
of
the
war
office
were
still
somewhat
vague
after
the
bridal
couple
had
left
miss
cogbill
and
lady
scarsdale
received
the
remaining
guests
and
when
the
function
was
over
her
ladyship
gave
her
american
relative
a
cordial
invitation
to
stay
at
the
towers
till
after
the
honeymoon
but
aunt
eliza
refused
i
come
some
day
and
be
glad
to
she
said
but
i
off
for
two
weeks
in
paris
i
always
go
there
when
i
blue
it
cheers
one
up
so
and
you
meet
more
americans
there
nowadays
than
you
do
at
home
perhaps
you
will
see
the
happy
pair
before
you
return
suggested
lady
scarsdale
now
your
ladyship
said
aunt
eliza
that
is
fair
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
of
the
matter
i
no
more
idea
where
they
are
going
beyond
their
first
stop
than
you
have
and
that
is
they
will
write
you
from
there
replied
miss
cogbill
and
then
you
will
know
as
much
as
i
do
scarsdale
was
quite
too
happy
to
be
seriously
worried
over
his
ignorance
of
their
destination
in
fact
he
was
rather
amused
at
his
wife
little
mystery
and
beyond
indulging
in
some
banter
on
the
subject
was
well
content
to
let
the
matter
drop
he
entertained
her
however
by
making
wild
guesses
as
to
where
they
were
to
pass
the
night
from
what
he
had
learned
of
their
point
of
departure
waterloo
station
but
soon
turned
to
more
engrossing
topics
and
before
he
realised
it
an
hour
had
passed
away
and
the
train
began
to
slow
up
for
their
first
stop
out
of
london
is
this
the
end
of
our
journey
he
queried
what
basingstoke
she
cried
how
could
you
think
i
be
so
unromantic
why
it
is
only
a
miserable
dirty
railway
junction
perhaps
we
change
carriages
here
wrong
again
but
the
train
stops
for
a
few
minutes
and
if
you
be
good
you
may
run
out
and
have
a
breath
of
fresh
air
and
something
to
drink
how
do
you
know
he
asked
that
i
go
forward
and
see
how
the
luggage
is
labelled
that
would
not
be
playing
fair
she
replied
pouting
and
i
should
be
dreadfully
cross
with
you
i
promise
to
be
good
he
hastened
to
assure
her
and
as
the
train
drew
up
stepped
out
upon
the
platform
his
first
intention
had
been
to
make
straight
for
the
but
he
had
only
taken
a
few
steps
in
that
direction
when
he
saw
advancing
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
train
none
other
than
robert
allingford
who
like
himself
was
a
bridegroom
of
that
day
why
benedick
he
cried
who
would
have
thought
of
meeting
you
just
what
i
was
going
to
say
replied
the
consul
heartily
shaking
his
outstretched
hand
i
never
imagined
that
we
would
select
the
same
train
come
let
have
a
drink
to
celebrate
our
auspicious
meeting
there
is
time
enough
are
you
sure
asked
the
careful
englishman
quite
replied
his
american
friend
i
asked
a
porter
and
he
said
we
had
ten
minutes
they
accordingly
repaired
to
the
and
were
soon
discussing
whiskies
and
sodas
tell
me
said
the
consul
as
he
put
down
his
glass
have
you
discovered
your
destination
yet
have
the
remotest
idea
returned
the
other
scarsdale
insisted
on
buying
the
tickets
and
watches
over
them
jealously
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
look
of
the
thing
i
would
have
bribed
the
guard
to
tell
me
where
i
was
going
by
the
way
wo
you
shake
hands
with
my
wife
she
is
just
forward
with
pleasure
replied
allingford
if
you
will
return
the
compliment
my
carriage
is
the
first
of
its
class
at
the
rear
of
the
train
we
have
still
six
minutes
with
which
the
two
husbands
separated
each
to
seek
the
other
wife
scarsdale
met
with
a
cordial
welcome
from
allingford
and
was
soon
seated
by
her
side
chatting
merrily
we
should
sympathise
with
each
other
she
said
laughing
for
i
understand
that
we
are
both
in
ignorance
of
our
destination
indeed
we
should
he
replied
i
dare
say
that
at
this
moment
your
husband
and
my
wife
are
gloating
over
their
superior
knowledge
oh
well
she
continued
our
time
will
come
and
now
tell
me
how
you
have
endured
the
vicissitudes
of
the
day
i
think
you
and
i
have
no
cause
for
complaint
rejoined
scarsdale
you
see
we
understand
our
conventions
but
i
fear
that
our
respective
partners
have
not
had
such
an
easy
time
i
should
think
it
would
have
worried
scarsdale
returned
the
englishwoman
of
course
it
did
said
that
lady
husband
nothing
ever
worries
her
but
i
think
signing
the
register
puzzled
her
a
bit
she
said
it
made
her
feel
as
if
she
was
at
an
hotel
robert
enjoyed
it
thoroughly
said
allingford
had
he
no
criticisms
to
offer
none
except
that
one
seemed
to
get
a
good
deal
more
for
one
money
than
in
the
states
the
almighty
dollar
said
scarsdale
laughing
and
added
as
he
looked
at
his
watch
i
must
be
off
or
your
husband
will
be
turning
me
out
our
ten
minutes
are
almost
up
once
on
the
platform
he
paused
aghast
the
forward
half
of
the
train
had
disappeared
and
an
engine
was
backing
up
in
its
place
to
couple
on
to
the
second
part
allingford
was
nowhere
in
sight
where
is
the
rest
of
the
train
cried
scarsdale
seizing
an
astonished
guard
the
forward
division
sir
yes
yes
for
heaven
sake
speak
man
where
is
it
that
was
the
exeter
division
went
five
minutes
ago
but
i
thought
we
had
ten
minutes
this
division
yes
sir
replied
the
guard
indicating
that
portion
of
the
train
still
in
the
station
the
forward
part
only
five
in
this
way
then
had
allingford
unconsciously
deceived
him
and
without
doubt
the
american
consul
had
been
carried
off
with
his
scarsdale
wife
the
awful
discovery
staggered
him
but
he
controlled
himself
sufficiently
to
ask
the
destination
of
the
section
still
in
the
station
bournemouth
sir
southampton
first
stop
are
you
going
we
are
just
off
no
replied
scarsdale
the
guard
waved
his
flag
the
shrill
whistle
blew
and
the
train
began
to
move
then
he
thought
of
allingford
he
could
scarcely
leave
her
besides
what
was
the
use
of
remaining
at
basingstoke
when
he
did
not
even
know
his
own
destination
he
tore
open
the
door
of
the
carriage
he
had
just
left
and
swung
himself
in
as
it
swept
past
him
chapter
iv
in
which
lady
melton
feels
that
her
aversion
is
justified
from
what
has
been
said
it
may
be
imagined
that
scarsdale
vernon
was
an
excellent
hand
at
light
and
amusing
conversation
and
so
pleasantly
did
she
receive
the
consul
and
so
amusingly
rally
him
on
the
events
of
the
day
that
he
scarcely
seemed
to
have
been
with
her
a
minute
when
a
slight
jolt
caused
him
to
look
up
and
out
only
to
perceive
the
basingstoke
station
sliding
rapidly
past
the
windows
allingford
first
impulse
was
to
dash
from
the
carriage
a
dangerous
experiment
when
one
remembers
the
rapidity
with
which
a
light
english
train
gets
under
way
in
this
however
he
was
forestalled
by
scarsdale
who
clung
to
his
declaring
that
he
should
not
desert
her
so
that
by
the
time
he
was
able
to
free
himself
the
train
had
attained
such
speed
as
to
preclude
any
longer
the
question
of
escape
the
sensations
which
allingford
and
scarsdale
experienced
when
they
realised
that
they
were
being
borne
swiftly
away
the
one
from
his
wife
and
the
other
from
her
husband
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
the
deserted
bride
threw
herself
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
carriage
and
began
to
laugh
hysterically
while
the
consul
plunged
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
gave
vent
to
a
monosyllabic
expletive
of
which
he
meant
every
letter
after
the
first
moments
of
astonishment
and
stupefaction
both
somewhat
recovered
their
senses
and
mutual
explanations
and
recriminations
began
forthwith
how
has
this
dreadful
thing
happened
demanded
scarsdale
in
a
voice
quavering
with
suppressed
emotion
i
afraid
it
my
fault
said
allingford
ruefully
the
guard
told
me
we
had
ten
minutes
that
was
for
your
division
of
the
train
stupid
exclaimed
the
lady
wrathfully
i
did
know
that
explained
the
consul
and
so
i
told
your
husband
we
had
ten
minutes
which
probably
accounts
for
his
being
left
then
i
never
never
forgive
you
she
cried
and
burst
into
tears
murmuring
between
her
sobs
poor
dear
harold
what
will
he
do
do
exclaimed
the
consul
i
should
think
he
had
done
enough
in
all
conscience
why
confound
him
he
gone
off
with
my
wife
do
you
call
my
husband
names
sobbed
scarsdale
well
he
certainly
has
enough
of
his
own
that
a
fact
if
you
were
a
man
retorted
the
disconsolate
bride
you
would
do
something
instead
of
making
stupid
jokes
about
my
poor
stanley
i
a
distressed
american
citizen
no
you
not
you
became
a
british
subject
when
you
married
scarsdale
corrected
allingford
well
i
wo
be
so
there
i
tell
you
i
an
american
woman
in
distress
and
you
are
my
consul
and
you
got
to
help
me
i
help
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
in
the
world
i
quite
as
anxious
to
recover
my
wife
as
you
can
be
to
find
your
husband
then
what
do
you
advise
she
asked
we
are
going
somewhere
at
a
rapid
rate
he
replied
when
we
arrive
we
will
leave
the
train
and
return
to
basingstoke
as
soon
as
possible
now
do
you
happen
to
know
our
next
stop
yes
salisbury
how
long
before
we
get
there
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
that
will
at
least
give
us
time
he
said
to
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
have
you
a
railway
guide
i
think
there
is
a
south
western
in
the
pocket
of
dear
malcolm
coat
she
said
indicating
a
garment
on
the
seat
beside
her
why
do
you
call
him
hubart
and
be
done
with
it
queried
allingford
as
he
searched
for
and
found
the
desired
paper
given
him
all
his
other
names
i
reserve
that
for
important
occasions
she
replied
it
sounds
so
impressive
mabel
scarsdale
it
will
be
noticed
was
fast
regaining
her
composure
now
that
a
definite
course
of
action
had
been
determined
upon
but
she
could
not
help
feeling
depressed
for
it
must
be
admitted
that
it
is
disheartening
to
lose
your
husband
before
you
have
been
married
a
day
what
would
he
do
she
wondered
when
he
found
that
the
train
had
gone
had
he
discovered
its
departure
soon
enough
to
warn
allingford
to
leave
her
carriage
and
if
not
where
had
she
gone
and
had
he
accompanied
her
the
event
certainly
afforded
ample
grounds
for
speculation
but
her
reverie
was
interrupted
by
the
consul
who
had
been
deeply
immersed
in
the
there
is
no
train
back
to
basingstoke
before
ten
he
said
so
we
must
spend
the
evening
in
salisbury
and
telegraph
them
to
await
our
return
possibly
my
husband
may
have
chased
the
train
and
caught
the
rear
carriage
i
have
seen
people
do
that
she
ventured
the
guard
van
you
mean
he
explained
in
that
case
he
is
travelling
down
with
us
and
will
put
in
an
appearance
directly
we
reach
salisbury
though
i
do
think
it
likely
however
there
nothing
to
worry
about
and
i
must
beg
you
not
to
do
so
unless
you
wish
to
make
me
more
miserable
than
i
already
am
for
my
share
in
this
deplorable
blunder
you
do
think
they
would
follow
us
to
salisbury
no
that
is
and
he
plunged
into
the
intricacies
of
the
once
more
they
could
besides
they
would
receive
our
telegram
before
they
could
leave
basingstoke
could
they
have
gone
off
on
the
other
train
impossible
he
replied
by
jove
they
neither
of
them
know
where
they
are
bound
for
quite
true
she
said
they
do
not
we
had
tickets
for
exeter
but
as
a
joke
i
never
let
my
husband
see
them
we
were
going
to
bournemouth
and
here
are
my
tickets
he
returned
holding
them
up
but
my
wife
does
know
it
you
think
there
is
no
question
that
they
are
waiting
for
us
at
basingstoke
she
asked
not
a
doubt
of
it
and
so
we
have
nothing
to
do
but
kill
time
till
we
can
rejoin
them
which
wo
be
hard
in
your
society
he
replied
i
sorry
i
ca
be
so
polite
she
returned
but
i
want
my
husband
and
if
you
talk
to
me
much
more
i
shall
probably
cry
the
consul
at
this
made
a
dive
for
an
adjacent
newspaper
in
which
he
remained
buried
till
the
train
slowed
down
for
salisbury
i
suppose
he
said
apologetically
as
they
drew
up
at
their
destination
that
you
wo
object
to
my
appropriating
coat
and
hat
i
dare
say
he
is
sporting
mine
a
tearful
sniff
was
the
only
reply
as
he
gathered
up
the
various
impedimenta
with
which
the
carriage
was
littered
and
assisted
his
fair
though
doleful
companion
to
alight
returning
a
few
moments
later
from
the
arduous
duty
of
rescuing
her
luggage
which
was
of
course
labelled
for
exeter
he
found
her
still
alone
there
being
no
sign
of
scarsdale
in
or
out
of
the
train
and
no
telegram
for
them
from
basingstoke
a
chance
on
which
allingford
had
counted
considerably
though
he
had
not
thought
it
wise
to
mention
it
indeed
the
fact
that
no
inquiry
had
been
made
for
them
puzzled
and
worried
him
greatly
for
it
seemed
almost
certain
that
were
their
deserted
partners
still
at
basingstoke
their
first
action
would
have
been
to
telegraph
to
the
fugitives
however
he
put
the
best
face
he
could
on
the
matter
assured
scarsdale
that
everything
must
be
all
right
and
despatched
his
telegram
back
to
their
point
of
separation
under
the
most
favourable
circumstances
they
could
not
receive
an
answer
under
half
an
hour
and
with
this
information
the
consul
was
forced
to
return
to
the
disconsolate
bride
there
is
no
use
in
loafing
around
here
he
said
suppose
we
go
and
see
the
cathedral
it
will
be
something
to
do
and
may
distract
our
thoughts
i
do
think
mine
could
well
be
more
distracted
than
they
are
now
replied
she
besides
we
might
miss
the
telegram
oh
i
fix
that
he
returned
i
have
it
sent
up
after
us
come
you
had
better
go
you
ca
sit
and
look
at
that
engine
for
thirty
minutes
it
is
enough
to
give
you
a
fit
of
the
blues
well
just
as
you
please
she
said
and
they
started
up
into
the
town
and
made
their
way
to
the
cathedral
it
is
not
to
the
point
of
this
narrative
to
discourse
on
the
beauties
of
that
structure
the
finest
shaft
of
purbec
marble
it
contains
would
prove
cold
consolation
to
either
a
bride
or
a
bridegroom
deserted
on
the
wedding
day
but
the
cool
quiet
of
the
great
building
seemed
unconsciously
to
soothe
their
troubled
spirits
though
when
they
each
revisited
the
spot
in
after
years
they
discovered
that
it
was
entirely
new
to
them
and
that
they
possessed
not
the
faintest
recollection
of
its
appearance
within
or
without
at
last
after
having
consulted
their
watches
for
the
hundredth
time
they
began
to
stroll
down
the
great
central
aisle
towards
the
main
entrance
suddenly
scarsdale
clutched
the
consul
arm
and
pointed
before
her
to
where
a
with
a
look
of
expectancy
on
his
face
and
an
envelope
in
his
hand
stood
framed
in
a
gothic
doorway
then
they
made
a
wild
scrambling
rush
down
the
church
the
bride
reaching
the
goal
first
and
snatching
the
telegram
from
its
astonished
bearer
for
allingford
he
began
but
she
had
already
torn
open
the
envelope
and
was
devouring
its
contents
for
a
moment
the
words
seemed
to
swim
before
her
eyes
then
as
their
meaning
became
clear
to
her
she
gave
a
frightened
gasp
dropped
the
message
on
the
floor
sat
down
hard
on
the
tomb
of
a
crusader
and
burst
into
tears
allingford
gazed
at
her
silently
for
a
moment
and
meditatively
scratched
his
head
then
he
paid
and
dismissed
the
amazed
boy
and
finally
picked
up
the
crumpled
bit
of
paper
it
was
from
the
at
basingstoke
and
read
as
follows
mentioned
left
in
second
division
for
southampton
and
south
coast
resorts
destination
not
it
was
incomprehensible
but
he
had
expected
it
if
scarsdale
had
remained
at
basingstoke
he
would
certainly
have
telegraphed
them
from
there
at
their
first
stop
salisbury
evidently
he
too
had
been
carried
away
on
the
train
but
where
it
was
some
relief
to
know
that
his
wife
was
not
wholly
alone
but
he
did
not
at
all
like
the
idea
of
her
going
off
into
space
with
another
man
and
the
fact
that
he
had
done
the
same
thing
himself
was
no
consolation
then
his
mind
reverted
to
scarsdale
who
still
wept
on
the
tomb
of
the
crusader
what
in
thunder
was
he
going
to
do
with
her
to
get
her
back
to
her
aunt
in
london
at
that
time
of
night
was
out
of
the
question
but
where
else
could
he
take
her
this
point
however
was
settled
at
once
and
in
an
unexpected
manner
by
the
lady
herself
drying
her
eyes
she
remarked
suddenly
i
a
little
fool
not
at
all
he
replied
your
emotion
is
quite
natural
under
the
circumstances
but
crying
wo
get
us
out
of
this
awful
predicament
unfortunately
no
or
we
should
have
arrived
at
a
solution
long
ago
that
remarked
the
lady
is
merely
another
way
of
making
a
statement
which
you
just
now
disputed
i
a
little
fool
and
i
mean
to
dry
my
eyes
and
attend
strictly
to
business
tell
me
exactly
what
this
message
implies
it
means
said
the
consul
that
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
rejoin
your
husband
her
lip
quivered
dangerously
but
she
controlled
herself
sufficiently
to
exclaim
but
what
are
we
to
do
well
he
replied
i
should
advise
remaining
here
there
is
a
good
hotel
but
we
ca
do
you
see
i
must
not
remain
with
you
she
spoke
the
last
words
with
an
effort
yes
he
rejoined
it
is
awkward
but
you
ca
spend
the
night
in
the
streets
you
must
have
somewhere
to
sleep
let
us
go
back
to
basingstoke
then
i
ca
see
that
that
would
help
matters
he
said
gloomily
we
would
have
to
spend
the
night
there
just
the
same
besides
i
think
it
is
going
to
rain
they
were
standing
outside
the
church
by
this
time
no
he
continued
our
best
course
our
only
course
in
fact
is
to
stay
here
return
to
basingstoke
morning
and
wait
for
them
there
you
may
be
sure
they
are
having
quite
as
bad
a
time
as
we
are
if
i
only
knew
some
one
here
bravo
she
interrupted
clapping
her
hands
i
believe
you
have
solved
the
problem
look
do
you
see
that
carriage
over
there
what
coat
of
arms
has
it
quick
your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
in
the
gathering
twilight
he
saw
driving
leisurely
by
with
coachman
and
footman
on
the
box
a
handsome
barouche
on
the
panels
of
which
a
coat
of
arms
was
emblazoned
well
he
said
gazing
hard
at
it
there
is
a
helmet
with
a
plume
balanced
on
a
stick
of
peppermint
candy
yes
yes
she
cried
the
crest
go
on
down
on
the
he
continued
there
is
a
pink
shield
divided
in
quarters
with
the
same
helmet
in
the
division
and
a
lot
of
silver
in
the
one
below
it
spurs
she
interjected
well
perhaps
they
are
he
admitted
then
there
are
a
couple
of
blue
lions
swimming
in
a
crimson
lake
the
melton
arms
she
cried
i
looked
them
up
in
when
that
old
catawampus
refused
to
come
to
our
wedding
we
will
spend
with
lady
diana
but
i
thought
began
the
consul
when
his
companion
interrupted
him
exclaiming
chase
that
carriage
as
hard
as
you
know
how
and
bring
it
here
allingford
felt
that
this
was
a
time
for
action
and
not
for
speech
the
days
of
his
collegiate
triumphs
when
he
had
put
his
best
foot
foremost
on
the
rose
to
his
mind
and
he
fled
across
the
green
and
into
the
gathering
gloom
which
had
now
swallowed
up
her
chariot
with
a
swiftness
that
caused
his
companion
to
murmur
well
he
can
sprint
presently
the
equipage
was
seen
returning
with
the
heated
and
triumphant
consul
inside
it
drew
up
before
her
and
the
footman
alighted
and
approached
questioningly
is
this
lady
melton
carriage
she
asked
yes
madam
then
you
may
drive
this
gentleman
and
me
to
melton
court
but
madam
i
am
scarsdale
lady
diana
she
said
quietly
the
footman
touched
his
hat
was
her
ladyship
expecting
you
we
were
sent
to
meet
this
next
train
but
no
we
are
here
unexpectedly
ourselves
but
i
dare
say
there
will
be
room
for
all
as
the
carriage
holds
four
there
will
only
be
lord
cowbray
madam
and
his
lordship
may
not
arrive
till
the
if
you
would
not
mind
driving
to
the
station
it
is
just
what
we
wish
she
replied
and
calmly
stepped
into
the
carriage
and
seated
herself
by
the
consul
side
who
was
so
amazed
at
the
turn
affairs
had
taken
that
he
remained
speechless
shall
i
see
to
your
luggage
madam
inquired
the
footman
as
they
drew
up
opposite
the
door
no
she
replied
stepping
out
on
the
platform
we
will
attend
to
it
ourselves
it
will
only
be
necessary
to
take
up
our
for
accompanied
by
the
consul
she
went
in
search
of
their
belongings
and
at
her
suggestion
he
took
a
gladstone
belonging
to
the
absent
scarsdale
and
a
which
she
designated
as
her
own
property
i
was
anxious
to
have
a
word
alone
with
you
she
said
as
they
emerged
once
more
on
the
platform
and
we
ca
talk
on
personal
matters
during
the
drive
to
the
court
you
see
my
position
is
a
little
peculiar
excuse
me
for
asking
the
question
he
replied
but
are
your
relations
with
your
husband
quite
cordial
on
the
contrary
they
are
quite
the
reverse
she
detests
all
americans
and
was
very
much
put
out
at
poor
harold
for
marrying
me
her
refusal
to
be
present
at
our
wedding
was
almost
an
insult
she
returned
that
does
seem
to
promise
a
pleasant
reception
at
melton
court
he
said
far
from
it
but
any
port
is
acceptable
in
a
storm
and
she
can
hardly
refuse
us
shelter
after
all
i
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
marrying
my
husband
or
being
carried
off
with
you
oh
i
trust
you
to
hold
your
own
with
any
dowager
in
the
united
kingdom
but
where
do
i
come
in
you
are
my
consul
and
under
the
circumstances
my
national
protector
i
ca
do
without
you
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
her
ladyship
will
see
it
in
that
light
but
as
you
say
it
is
better
than
nothing
and
our
position
ca
be
worse
than
it
is
at
present
then
it
is
agreed
we
stand
by
each
other
through
thick
and
thin
exactly
he
replied
and
shook
her
extended
hand
at
this
moment
the
train
came
in
and
they
returned
to
the
carriage
lord
cowbray
did
not
put
in
an
appearance
and
they
were
soon
under
way
for
melton
court
which
was
some
miles
distant
from
the
town
by
the
time
they
entered
the
grounds
it
was
quite
dark
and
they
could
only
see
that
the
park
was
extensive
and
that
the
court
seemed
large
and
gloomy
and
might
have
dated
from
the
elizabethan
period
on
entering
the
central
hall
they
at
once
saw
evidences
of
a
large
whose
presence
did
not
tend
to
put
them
more
at
their
ease
and
scarsdale
lost
no
time
in
sending
a
message
to
lady
melton
to
the
effect
that
her
had
arrived
unexpectedly
and
would
much
appreciate
a
few
words
with
her
in
private
they
were
shown
into
a
little
and
the
footman
returned
shortly
to
say
that
her
ladyship
would
be
with
them
soon
after
what
seemed
an
endless
time
but
was
in
reality
barely
fifteen
minutes
their
hostess
entered
she
was
a
woman
of
sixty
or
over
with
a
stern
hard
face
and
a
set
expression
about
her
thin
lips
that
boded
little
good
to
offenders
whatever
their
age
or
sex
she
looked
her
guests
over
through
her
gold
and
after
waiting
a
moment
for
them
to
speak
said
coldly
i
think
there
is
some
mistake
i
was
told
that
my
niece
wished
to
see
me
i
said
your
returned
scarsdale
oh
my
well
i
do
not
recognise
you
it
would
be
strange
if
you
did
lady
melton
returned
the
bride
as
you
never
seen
me
i
am
the
wife
of
your
harold
stanley
malcolm
hubart
scarsdale
i
do
not
see
your
husband
present
said
her
ladyship
directing
an
icy
glare
at
the
unfortunate
consul
no
replied
her
niece
i
lost
him
lost
him
yes
at
basingstoke
he
went
to
speak
to
a
lady
in
another
part
of
the
train
i
could
make
it
clearer
to
you
i
think
by
saying
that
she
was
sir
peter
steele
youngest
daughter
i
never
thought
of
knowing
the
steeles
when
i
was
in
london
commented
her
hostess
but
hubart
was
always
liberal
in
his
tastes
a
remark
which
caused
the
consul
to
flush
with
wrath
oh
he
did
know
her
interjected
mabel
hastening
to
correct
the
unfortunate
turn
which
the
conversation
had
taken
she
was
this
gentleman
wife
her
ladyship
bowed
very
very
slightly
in
the
consul
direction
to
indicate
that
his
affairs
matrimonial
or
otherwise
could
have
for
her
no
possible
interest
and
that
is
the
last
we
have
heard
of
them
continued
the
bride
except
for
a
telegram
from
the
at
basingstoke
which
says
they
went
to
southampton
do
i
understand
you
to
say
broke
in
their
hostess
betraying
the
first
sign
of
interest
she
had
so
far
evinced
that
my
nephew
has
eloped
with
no
no
cried
scarsdale
you
do
not
in
the
least
comprehend
the
true
state
of
affairs
and
she
poured
forth
a
voluble
if
disconnected
account
of
their
adventures
pardon
me
exclaimed
the
old
lady
when
she
had
finished
but
what
is
all
this
rigmarole
a
most
surprising
affair
i
must
say
and
quite
worthy
of
your
nationality
i
was
averse
to
my
nephew
marrying
you
from
the
first
but
i
hardly
expected
to
be
justified
on
his
wedding
day
in
that
case
said
scarsdale
the
sooner
we
leave
your
house
the
better
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
replied
her
your
coming
to
me
is
the
only
wise
thing
you
have
done
of
course
you
will
remain
here
till
your
husband
can
be
found
as
for
this
person
indicating
allingford
this
said
his
partner
in
misfortune
coming
to
his
rescue
is
robert
allingford
united
states
consul
at
christchurch
as
my
husband
had
gone
off
with
his
wife
i
thought
the
least
i
could
do
was
to
take
him
with
me
i
can
hardly
see
the
necessity
of
that
course
commented
her
hostess
now
that
i
have
seen
scarsdale
in
safe
hands
i
could
not
think
of
trespassing
longer
upon
your
hospitality
put
in
the
consul
but
his
companion
intervened
i
am
not
going
to
be
deserted
twice
in
a
day
she
cried
if
you
go
i
go
with
you
about
that
said
her
ladyship
frigidly
there
can
be
no
question
and
she
rang
the
bell
you
will
conduct
this
lady
and
this
gentleman
she
continued
to
the
footman
who
answered
her
summons
to
the
green
room
and
the
tower
room
respectively
then
turning
to
her
unwilling
guests
she
added
as
my
is
fully
arranged
for
this
evening
and
my
guests
are
now
awaiting
me
you
will
pardon
it
if
i
have
your
dinner
served
in
my
private
we
will
discuss
your
affairs
at
length
morning
but
now
i
must
bid
you
and
with
an
inclination
of
her
head
she
dismissed
them
from
her
presence
chapter
v
in
which
a
trunk
is
sent
to
melton
court
scarcely
had
the
sun
risen
the
next
morning
when
the
consul
after
a
sleepless
night
stole
downstairs
and
found
his
way
out
upon
the
terrace
for
a
quiet
stroll
and
a
breath
of
fresh
cool
air
moreover
he
was
in
need
of
an
uninterrupted
hour
in
which
to
arrange
his
plans
in
such
a
manner
as
would
most
surely
tend
to
effect
the
double
reunion
he
so
earnestly
desired
it
seemed
impossible
in
the
small
space
of
country
which
had
probably
been
traversed
by
all
parties
that
they
could
lose
each
other
for
more
than
a
few
hours
to
make
the
situation
more
clear
to
those
who
have
never
had
the
misfortune
to
suffer
from
the
intricacies
of
english
railway
travel
the
following
diagram
is
appended
the
triangle
is
isosceles
the
sides
being
miles
long
the
base
twenty
illustration
he
reviewed
his
own
adventures
of
yesterday
afternoon
he
had
acted
on
what
seemed
to
be
the
only
sensible
and
reasonable
plan
to
pursue
namely
to
leave
the
train
at
its
first
stop
and
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
the
point
of
divergence
it
seemed
fair
to
assume
that
scarsdale
and
allingford
had
done
the
same
thing
and
such
being
the
case
it
was
easy
to
imagine
what
their
course
of
action
had
been
a
glance
at
the
told
him
that
the
first
point
at
which
they
could
leave
their
division
of
the
train
had
been
southampton
from
which
place
they
could
almost
immediately
catch
an
express
back
to
the
junction
they
had
left
arriving
there
shortly
after
seven
on
the
past
evening
his
own
course
and
that
of
scarsdale
seemed
clear
it
was
simply
a
return
to
basingstoke
immediately
after
breakfast
and
rejoin
their
friends
who
had
been
spending
the
night
at
that
place
it
was
possible
that
they
had
lost
the
returning
express
and
remained
in
southampton
but
if
they
acted
in
a
rational
manner
they
must
eventually
return
to
the
junction
but
supposing
allingford
and
scarsdale
had
not
done
the
obvious
thing
supposing
that
chance
had
intervened
and
upset
their
plans
as
in
his
own
case
he
suddenly
found
himself
face
to
face
with
the
startling
fact
that
not
only
were
he
and
scarsdale
not
at
salisbury
or
basingstoke
but
that
they
were
at
present
at
the
one
place
where
his
wife
and
scarsdale
husband
would
never
think
of
looking
for
them
melton
court
allingford
jammed
his
hat
hard
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
to
salisbury
and
the
nearest
telegraph
station
arriving
at
his
destination
shortly
before
seven
to
find
that
he
had
a
good
to
wait
before
the
operators
arrived
the
office
was
opened
at
last
however
and
he
lost
no
time
in
telegraphing
to
basingstoke
for
information
and
in
a
little
while
received
an
answer
from
the
at
that
point
which
cheered
him
up
considerably
though
it
was
not
quite
as
explicit
as
he
could
have
wished
it
read
as
follows
telegraphed
last
evening
from
southampton
saying
he
had
left
train
there
with
allingford
and
was
returning
at
once
to
the
consul
was
pleased
to
find
that
his
conjectures
had
been
correct
he
felt
that
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
his
mind
their
missing
partners
had
undoubtedly
spent
the
night
at
basingstoke
and
would
soon
consult
the
at
that
point
who
would
doubtless
show
them
the
messages
he
had
received
allingford
looked
out
a
good
train
telegraphed
the
hour
of
their
arrival
and
then
as
his
reception
of
the
night
before
had
not
inclined
him
to
trespass
on
lady
melton
grudging
hospitality
more
than
was
absolutely
necessary
he
had
a
leisurely
breakfast
at
the
hotel
and
engaging
a
fly
drove
back
to
the
court
reaching
there
about
nine
scarsdale
had
also
passed
a
disturbed
night
but
unlike
her
companion
in
misfortune
she
did
not
venture
out
at
unearthly
hours
in
the
morning
she
was
up
however
and
saw
him
depart
which
was
in
some
ways
a
comfort
since
it
assured
her
that
he
was
losing
no
time
in
continuing
their
quest
at
eight
a
maid
arrived
with
warm
water
and
a
message
from
her
ladyship
that
she
wished
scarsdale
to
breakfast
with
her
in
private
at
nine
and
that
she
would
be
obliged
if
her
would
keep
her
room
till
that
time
the
bride
was
considerably
piqued
by
this
message
and
the
distrust
it
implied
but
felt
it
would
be
wise
to
accede
to
the
request
and
sent
word
accordingly
as
she
entered
lady
melton
boudoir
an
hour
later
her
hostess
rose
to
receive
her
kissing
her
coldly
on
the
forehead
and
saying
you
will
pardon
my
requesting
you
to
keep
your
room
but
your
presence
is
not
as
yet
known
to
my
guests
and
your
appearance
among
them
immediately
after
your
marriage
without
your
husband
might
cause
unpleasant
speculation
and
comment
do
you
agree
with
me
quite
replied
scarsdale
she
had
misjudged
lady
melton
she
thought
but
she
disliked
her
nevertheless
and
wished
to
be
very
guarded
now
said
that
personage
i
want
to
hear
the
whole
affair
no
i
do
not
want
you
to
tell
it
as
her
guest
opened
her
mouth
to
speak
not
in
your
own
way
i
mean
you
would
probably
wander
from
the
point
and
my
time
is
of
importance
i
will
ask
you
questions
and
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
answer
them
as
plainly
and
shortly
as
possible
scarsdale
bowed
she
was
so
angry
at
the
cool
insolence
that
this
statement
implied
that
she
did
not
feel
she
could
trust
herself
to
speak
now
we
will
begin
said
her
ladyship
as
she
proceeded
to
demolish
a
boiled
egg
what
is
your
christian
name
mabel
very
well
then
i
shall
call
you
mabel
in
future
it
is
ridiculous
to
address
you
as
mrs
scarsdale
i
really
do
see
began
that
lady
excuse
me
interrupted
her
questioner
i
will
make
the
comments
when
necessary
when
were
you
married
yesterday
afternoon
at
where
did
you
and
your
husband
intend
to
pass
last
night
at
exeter
are
you
sure
i
ought
to
be
i
bought
the
tickets
you
bought
the
tickets
is
that
customary
in
your
country
i
am
not
here
to
discuss
the
customs
of
my
country
lady
melton
i
bought
the
tickets
because
i
chose
to
do
so
and
considered
myself
better
fitted
to
arrange
the
trip
than
my
husband
really
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
you
selected
the
most
roundabout
way
to
reach
exeter
your
husband
could
have
told
you
that
you
should
have
taken
another
railway
the
great
western
my
husband
said
scarsdale
stiffly
did
not
know
our
destination
what
i
say
that
my
husband
did
not
know
our
destination
her
ladyship
surveyed
her
for
a
moment
in
shocked
and
silent
disapproval
and
then
remarked
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
travelled
together
as
far
as
basingstoke
yes
and
there
hubart
met
a
friend
this
consular
person
allingford
yes
he
was
also
married
yesterday
and
came
to
our
carriage
to
congratulate
me
and
my
nephew
went
to
speak
to
mrs
allingford
exactly
and
the
first
thing
we
knew
the
train
was
moving
go
on
that
is
just
what
we
did
though
allingford
tried
to
leave
the
carriage
and
return
to
his
wife
it
would
have
been
better
had
he
never
left
her
but
i
restrained
him
how
did
you
restrain
him
by
his
excuse
me
do
i
understand
you
to
say
that
you
forcibly
detained
him
i
sorry
if
you
are
shocked
it
was
all
i
could
catch
hold
of
i
shall
reserve
my
criticism
of
these
very
astonishing
performances
mabel
but
permit
me
to
say
that
you
have
much
to
learn
concerning
the
manners
and
customs
of
english
society
then
said
scarsdale
ignoring
this
last
remark
we
came
to
salisbury
and
telegraphed
to
basingstoke
for
information
exactly
but
they
could
tell
us
nothing
so
when
i
saw
your
carriage
how
did
you
know
it
was
mine
i
looked
out
your
coat
of
arms
in
her
ladyship
smiled
grimly
perhaps
something
might
be
made
of
this
fair
barbarian
in
time
a
great
deal
of
time
but
still
this
knowledge
of
the
peerage
sounded
hopeful
and
it
was
with
a
little
less
severity
in
her
voice
that
she
demanded
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
now
go
back
to
basingstoke
this
morning
alone
no
with
mr
allingford
do
you
expect
to
find
your
husband
there
i
should
think
he
would
naturally
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
where
he
lost
me
i
do
know
said
her
ladyship
was
allingford
pretty
if
you
are
going
to
adopt
that
tack
lady
melton
the
sooner
we
part
the
better
said
her
visitor
angrily
we
do
not
tacks
in
england
returned
her
ladyship
calmly
and
as
i
consider
myself
responsible
for
your
actions
while
you
are
under
my
roof
i
shall
not
allow
you
to
go
to
basingstoke
or
anywhere
else
with
a
person
who
whatever
his
official
position
is
totally
unknown
to
me
you
do
mean
to
keep
me
here
against
my
will
i
mean
to
send
you
to
your
relations
wherever
they
are
under
the
charge
of
my
butler
a
most
respectable
married
man
provided
the
journey
can
be
accomplished
between
now
and
nightfall
well
it
ca
replied
her
triumphantly
aunt
eliza
left
for
paris
this
morning
and
all
my
other
relations
are
in
chicago
lady
melton
was
however
a
woman
of
decision
and
not
to
be
easily
baffled
then
i
will
send
you
to
your
lady
scarsdale
i
suppose
she
has
returned
to
towers
i
believe
so
but
i
do
not
intend
to
go
there
without
my
husband
it
would
be
ignominious
perhaps
you
can
suggest
a
better
plan
said
her
ladyship
coldly
well
if
you
refuse
to
let
me
go
to
basingstoke
began
the
bride
i
do
proceed
then
allingford
might
go
for
me
and
tell
hubart
where
i
am
i
know
he
is
waiting
for
me
there
but
he
would
never
think
of
my
being
here
excuse
me
i
mean
she
stammered
blushing
for
she
saw
she
had
made
a
slip
we
will
not
discuss
your
meaning
said
her
hostess
but
your
plan
seems
feasible
and
proper
you
may
receive
the
consular
person
in
my
private
and
arrange
matters
at
once
her
niece
turned
to
go
but
she
stopped
her
saying
one
word
more
i
do
not
think
it
necessary
for
your
friend
allingford
to
return
with
my
nephew
pray
make
this
clear
to
him
after
having
been
dismissed
from
her
hostess
presence
scarsdale
lost
no
time
in
sending
for
the
consul
who
had
just
returned
and
proceeded
to
work
off
on
that
unfortunate
gentleman
the
rage
engendered
by
her
recent
interview
i
inclined
to
think
he
said
when
she
had
finished
that
in
this
instance
the
catawampus
is
right
there
is
no
use
of
your
gallivanting
over
the
country
after
your
husband
he
ought
to
come
to
you
i
run
down
to
basingstoke
at
once
send
him
back
and
with
allingford
go
on
my
way
rejoicing
there
is
no
need
of
my
returning
and
i
guess
her
ladyship
wo
cry
her
eyes
out
if
i
do
you
have
yet
told
me
the
result
of
your
excursion
this
morning
she
said
hoping
to
divert
the
conversation
from
so
obvious
a
truth
this
he
replied
holding
up
the
telegram
he
had
just
received
from
the
at
basingstoke
after
reading
the
message
scarsdale
was
most
anxious
that
he
should
lose
no
time
in
starting
and
with
mutual
expressions
of
friendship
and
boundless
thanks
from
the
deserted
bride
they
parted
he
for
the
junction
she
for
a
further
interview
with
her
when
her
ladyship
learned
that
scarsdale
had
left
southampton
for
basingstoke
and
was
doubtless
now
in
that
place
she
advised
his
wife
to
remain
in
seclusion
till
the
members
of
the
which
luckily
was
breaking
up
that
day
had
departed
and
retired
herself
to
prepare
a
few
remarks
with
which
to
welcome
her
errant
later
in
the
day
however
she
so
far
relented
towards
his
wife
as
to
suggest
that
she
take
a
stroll
on
the
terrace
while
the
few
remaining
guests
were
indulging
in
a
siesta
it
was
from
this
coign
of
vantage
that
she
saw
approaching
the
worn
and
drooping
figure
of
allingford
she
rushed
to
meet
him
and
demanded
without
even
giving
him
time
to
get
his
breath
where
is
my
husband
i
do
know
he
gasped
or
your
wife
or
my
wife
are
they
in
basingstoke
no
and
have
been
there
i
turned
that
confounded
town
inside
out
and
catechised
every
one
about
the
station
from
the
divisional
superintendent
to
the
charwoman
they
did
not
come
last
night
nor
arrive
this
morning
since
leaving
southampton
if
they
did
leave
it
they
have
entirely
disappeared
why
do
you
say
they
did
leave
southampton
because
no
one
saw
them
go
i
have
learned
by
endless
telegraphing
that
they
alighted
at
that
point
told
a
porter
they
had
been
carried
past
their
destination
and
wished
to
return
at
once
to
basingstoke
he
indicated
their
train
they
disappeared
in
the
crowd
and
that
all
have
they
telegraphed
again
to
basingstoke
not
since
last
night
or
to
salisbury
no
i
inquired
on
the
chance
but
no
message
had
come
it
is
horrible
she
exclaimed
i
the
most
miserable
woman
on
earth
do
cry
he
begged
despairingly
no
she
said
i
wo
do
you
think
it
would
be
any
good
to
telegraph
to
aunt
eliza
and
lady
scarsdale
i
have
already
done
so
your
aunt
eliza
has
left
for
paris
she
would
have
done
that
if
she
had
heard
about
this
and
it
gave
lady
scarsdale
a
fit
the
telegram
i
mean
but
she
did
know
anything
is
that
all
not
quite
i
have
telegraphed
to
my
at
christchurch
asking
for
news
of
scarsdale
and
telling
him
to
forward
anything
that
had
come
for
me
they
might
have
there
you
know
to
save
talk
in
the
office
but
i
have
as
yet
had
a
reply
i
must
consult
lady
melton
the
situation
is
too
dreadful
for
words
suppose
they
have
had
an
accident
suppose
she
faltered
nonsense
he
rejoined
bad
news
always
travels
quickly
do
make
yourself
uneasy
on
that
score
they
got
in
some
place
just
as
we
have
i
go
to
southampton
and
work
up
the
trail
now
you
run
off
and
consult
the
catawampus
when
her
ladyship
had
heard
the
whole
story
she
summed
up
as
follows
as
your
friend
has
seen
fit
to
return
you
may
tell
him
his
chamber
will
be
again
made
ready
for
and
you
will
both
dine
in
my
as
before
i
shall
send
you
home
to
lady
scarsdale
but
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
on
the
subject
i
have
made
up
my
mind
and
having
pronounced
sentence
she
left
her
distracted
to
her
own
reflections
it
was
a
very
doleful
couple
who
sat
down
to
dinner
that
evening
in
lady
melton
private
room
it
is
ridiculous
said
scarsdale
we
are
being
treated
like
naughty
children
i
feel
as
if
i
were
about
to
be
whipped
and
put
to
bed
sent
home
with
the
butler
indeed
i
just
like
to
see
her
ladyship
try
to
do
it
how
are
you
going
to
prevent
her
asked
the
consul
i
not
a
child
and
i
wo
be
treated
as
one
if
i
am
to
be
sent
home
in
disgrace
you
will
have
to
come
with
me
well
i
like
that
you
seem
to
forget
i
lost
my
wife
my
first
duty
is
to
find
her
your
first
duty
is
to
me
if
you
go
to
southampton
i
go
with
you
i
afraid
there
be
an
awful
row
with
her
ladyship
let
there
be
then
i
do
care
i
really
think
he
expostulated
that
you
had
better
stay
here
one
day
more
i
get
you
a
reprieve
from
the
custody
of
the
butler
and
have
a
try
at
southampton
myself
there
is
a
from
here
and
it
wo
take
any
time
to
run
over
i
tracked
in
kentucky
when
i
was
sheriff
and
i
guess
i
can
find
a
bridegroom
where
it
all
open
country
as
it
is
round
here
at
this
moment
a
servant
knocked
and
entered
saying
please
madam
her
ladyship
orders
is
that
you
are
to
be
ready
at
seven
morning
to
start
with
mr
bright
the
butler
for
towers
i
began
scarsdale
rising
in
wrath
and
indignation
but
before
she
could
further
complicate
matters
by
a
direct
refusal
the
footman
had
turned
to
allingford
and
handing
him
a
telegram
had
left
the
room
forgetful
of
all
else
she
rushed
to
the
consul
side
as
with
nervous
fingers
he
tore
it
open
what
joyful
news
might
it
not
contain
one
look
at
his
face
however
blasted
all
her
hopes
horror
consternation
and
surprise
were
depicted
thereon
as
he
read
the
despatch
something
dreadful
must
have
happened
tell
me
the
worst
she
cried
is
it
harold
it
is
the
last
straw
he
replied
is
he
dead
i
wish
he
was
you
wish
my
husband
dead
oh
confound
your
husband
mr
allingford
no
no
i
do
mean
that
i
not
responsible
for
what
i
saying
he
replied
and
groaned
aloud
but
his
companion
was
not
to
be
put
off
is
that
telegram
from
my
husband
no
from
my
no
from
aunt
eliza
no
from
the
at
basingstoke
guess
again
from
your
yes
has
he
heard
anything
of
our
lost
ones
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
then
what
is
the
matter
what
does
it
all
mean
it
means
replied
the
consul
that
i
got
to
leave
here
by
the
first
train
explain
yourself
she
demanded
i
try
he
replied
mopping
his
brow
you
see
an
american
applied
to
me
to
lend
him
some
money
a
few
days
ago
and
put
up
as
collateral
an
elephant
harold
told
me
the
story
i
thought
it
very
amusing
you
wo
when
i
finished
the
elephant
arrived
day
before
yesterday
at
southampton
and
as
i
had
informed
the
steamship
company
that
i
was
the
temporary
owner
of
the
beast
they
forwarded
it
to
my
consulate
at
christchurch
how
does
that
affect
us
affect
us
he
cried
do
you
remember
what
i
telegraphed
my
yes
almost
word
for
word
she
answered
you
asked
for
news
of
the
fugitives
and
on
the
chance
of
their
writing
to
christchurch
told
him
to
forward
here
anything
that
might
have
come
for
you
exactly
shrieked
the
consul
and
the
blamed
fool
has
forwarded
the
elephant
what
here
to
melton
court
she
exclaimed
aghast
that
is
what
i
said
the
beast
is
on
the
way
now
and
ought
to
be
here
bright
and
early
morning
how
awful
what
will
you
do
get
out
he
replied
laconically
and
leave
me
i
do
know
about
you
but
i
mean
to
leave
the
elephant
i
do
wish
to
start
a
bigger
circus
than
i
have
on
hand
already
but
would
it
be
quite
right
to
our
hostess
expostulated
her
niece
if
you
any
conscientious
scruples
on
the
subject
you
can
stay
and
tend
the
beast
i
leaving
by
the
first
train
but
it
your
elephant
of
course
it
is
and
i
a
right
to
do
what
i
choose
with
it
i
mean
to
leave
it
to
lady
melton
in
payment
for
my
board
and
lodging
after
the
way
she
treated
me
i
do
want
to
owe
her
anything
really
allingford
began
his
companion
now
look
here
he
retorted
would
you
want
an
elephant
tagging
you
round
on
your
honeymoon
well
no
i
do
think
i
should
she
replied
laughing
besides
he
continued
how
am
i
to
prosecute
a
search
for
our
missing
halves
with
a
noah
ark
in
tow
that
does
put
the
matter
in
a
different
light
she
admitted
you
bet
it
does
he
replied
as
for
her
ladyship
she
can
do
what
she
pleases
with
my
slight
token
of
regard
give
it
to
the
poor
of
the
parish
if
she
likes
i
do
ask
her
to
keep
it
but
what
is
to
become
of
me
oh
you
are
to
be
sent
home
with
the
butler
early
morning
i
wo
go
then
join
me
but
supposing
we
do
find
my
husband
then
i
take
you
down
to
my
consulate
at
christchurch
for
the
night
i
have
plenty
of
friends
there
with
whom
you
can
stay
that
settles
it
she
replied
so
it
was
that
they
stole
away
from
the
court
in
the
grey
dawn
of
the
next
morning
footed
it
to
salisbury
recovered
their
baggage
and
boarded
the
early
train
for
southampton
as
it
moved
out
of
the
station
they
passed
a
long
line
of
box
cars
on
a
siding
from
one
of
which
the
angry
scream
of
an
elephant
resounded
just
in
time
said
the
consul
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
wish
her
ladyship
joy
of
my
little
remembrance
chapter
vi
in
which
scarsdale
changes
his
name
scarsdale
entered
allingford
compartment
with
so
great
an
impetus
when
he
swung
himself
into
her
carriage
at
basingstoke
that
he
completely
lost
his
balance
and
shot
past
her
on
all
fours
to
land
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
a
second
later
the
guard
banged
the
door
and
the
train
was
off
what
does
this
mean
exclaimed
the
consul
wife
and
where
is
my
husband
excuse
me
gasped
scarsdale
picking
himself
up
from
the
floor
but
i
could
leave
you
so
it
appears
she
replied
coldly
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
and
as
the
train
began
to
move
rapidly
it
is
not
possible
that
we
are
getting
under
way
yes
he
said
gloomily
we
are
off
to
southampton
answer
me
instantly
where
is
my
husband
she
demanded
gone
to
exeter
i
suppose
with
my
wife
what
do
you
mean
that
he
was
carried
off
in
the
first
division
of
the
train
which
left
five
minutes
ago
but
i
thought
we
stopped
ten
minutes
so
did
stopped
only
five
when
i
left
you
just
now
i
saw
that
the
forward
half
of
this
train
had
disappeared
and
the
guard
told
me
it
had
gone
to
exeter
and
that
this
portion
was
just
leaving
for
southampton
i
thought
it
better
to
stay
with
you
than
to
let
you
go
by
yourself
so
as
the
carriage
was
moving
and
it
was
impossible
to
get
you
out
i
jumped
in
thank
you
she
said
simply
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
between
them
while
the
train
rattled
over
the
points
and
reaching
the
outskirts
of
the
town
began
to
increase
its
speed
the
little
englishwoman
did
not
however
emulate
her
fair
american
partner
in
distress
who
was
at
this
moment
indulging
in
hysterics
in
the
other
train
she
had
been
too
well
trained
to
betray
her
feelings
before
a
man
whom
she
knew
but
slightly
even
over
the
loss
of
a
husband
so
after
remaining
quiet
for
a
little
she
controlled
herself
sufficiently
to
say
very
calmly
i
do
not
see
that
we
can
either
of
us
blame
ourselves
for
what
has
happened
we
must
try
and
make
the
best
of
it
and
rejoin
your
wife
and
my
husband
as
soon
as
possible
plucky
little
woman
thought
scarsdale
to
himself
to
allingford
he
said
i
am
glad
you
see
things
in
so
sensible
a
light
you
must
let
me
help
you
in
every
way
that
is
in
my
power
you
say
our
first
stop
is
southampton
she
asked
yes
we
reach
there
in
less
than
an
hour
they
slip
some
carriages
at
winchester
but
the
train
does
stop
he
replied
then
i
think
we
should
alight
at
southampton
she
said
and
return
at
once
to
basingstoke
that
would
certainly
be
our
best
course
when
you
lose
a
man
in
a
crowd
it
is
much
better
to
wait
at
the
point
where
you
lost
him
till
he
finds
you
than
to
hunt
for
him
yourself
as
you
will
both
miss
each
other
then
you
propose
to
let
them
find
us
that
is
my
idea
of
course
i
telegraph
to
the
at
basingstoke
that
we
will
return
there
so
that
if
they
wire
for
information
concerning
us
he
can
give
it
them
where
do
you
think
they
have
gone
if
we
either
of
us
knew
our
destination
it
would
be
far
easier
he
said
laughing
i
hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
my
wife
but
surely
the
train
must
stop
before
it
reaches
exeter
undoubtedly
but
as
i
have
no
i
ca
say
where
perhaps
your
husband
has
one
in
his
overcoat
if
you
will
permit
me
and
he
proceeded
to
examine
the
garment
in
question
no
was
forthcoming
however
and
they
were
forced
to
resign
themselves
to
waiting
till
they
reached
southampton
allingford
bore
up
bravely
and
even
tried
to
make
conversation
but
it
proved
to
be
a
dreary
ride
and
when
they
drew
up
at
their
destination
they
were
both
exceedingly
thankful
is
there
a
train
back
to
basingstoke
soon
asked
scarsdale
of
the
first
railway
porter
he
saw
yes
sir
over
there
on
the
left
express
leaves
in
three
or
four
minutes
replied
that
individual
as
he
hurried
away
with
somebody
else
baggage
i
take
you
over
said
scarsdale
no
replied
his
companion
i
can
find
it
you
attend
to
the
telegram
and
my
luggage
he
dashed
off
accordingly
and
when
he
returned
they
both
entered
the
train
on
the
left
i
sent
the
telegram
he
said
and
i
have
also
discovered
your
destination
how
she
inquired
by
the
labels
on
the
luggage
it
was
marked
for
bournemouth
and
a
jolly
hard
time
i
had
to
induce
them
to
take
it
out
of
the
van
and
send
it
back
with
us
it
seems
to
me
she
said
after
a
little
that
we
been
waiting
here
more
than
four
minutes
i
trust
we
are
not
in
the
wrong
train
one
has
just
gone
out
hi
guard
called
scarsdale
from
the
window
is
this
the
express
for
basingstoke
no
sir
replied
the
official
it
was
the
train
beyond
you
which
has
just
left
sorry
if
you
made
a
mistake
sir
confound
it
yes
cried
scarsdale
where
does
this
train
go
stopping
train
for
winchester
can
we
go
on
to
basingstoke
not
by
this
train
sir
but
from
winchester
there
is
sure
to
be
a
train
this
evening
sir
it
has
been
a
chapter
of
accidents
he
said
explaining
it
to
allingford
but
we
had
better
go
to
winchester
i
think
it
is
on
the
way
anyhow
yes
she
assented
and
then
get
on
to
basingstoke
as
fast
as
we
can
and
not
be
discouraged
quite
right
he
replied
and
entered
into
a
description
of
southampton
docks
and
the
varied
cargoes
that
were
received
there
in
the
hope
of
distracting
her
mind
oh
look
she
cried
as
once
more
started
on
their
travels
they
came
in
sight
of
the
shipping
see
what
they
are
loading
on
that
truck
i
do
believe
it
is
an
elephant
after
what
seemed
an
interminable
journey
they
at
length
arrived
at
winchester
and
as
soon
as
scarsdale
had
seen
allingford
established
in
the
ladies
he
hastened
to
ascertain
their
chances
of
getting
to
basingstoke
that
night
on
his
return
he
wore
a
very
long
face
which
his
companion
was
not
slow
to
interpret
are
there
no
trains
she
exclaimed
in
evident
dismay
there
is
one
he
replied
but
we
should
not
reach
our
destination
till
very
late
almost
midnight
in
fact
and
we
can
not
tell
that
we
should
find
your
husband
even
then
i
think
our
best
course
would
be
to
remain
here
oh
but
that
is
impossible
no
there
is
a
very
fair
hotel
i
did
mean
that
but
ca
you
see
the
position
in
which
i
am
placed
he
did
see
and
he
knew
that
what
he
proposed
seemed
to
her
almost
an
impossibility
but
as
they
were
now
situated
he
considered
that
circumstances
altered
cases
i
am
sure
allingford
he
said
that
your
good
sense
which
has
carried
you
through
so
much
this
afternoon
will
show
you
the
necessity
of
acting
as
i
have
suggested
you
must
not
forget
that
you
are
now
a
married
woman
and
can
do
things
which
before
were
not
permissible
still
she
contended
to
go
to
a
public
hotel
with
a
gentleman
who
is
a
comparative
stranger
and
pass
the
night
there
seems
to
me
not
the
thing
at
all
and
if
we
were
recognised
by
anybody
she
paused
hardly
knowing
how
to
complete
her
sentence
then
go
alone
there
are
other
hotels
i
will
put
up
somewhere
else
he
replied
no
no
i
could
be
left
alone
i
never
been
alone
before
in
my
life
that
would
be
worse
than
all
else
you
see
if
you
were
only
related
to
me
it
would
be
so
different
i
am
quite
willing
to
pass
myself
off
as
any
relation
you
please
for
the
sake
of
appearances
but
that
would
be
deceitful
i
think
the
exigencies
of
the
case
will
excuse
that
besides
it
is
my
own
affair
not
yours
will
you
have
me
as
a
brother
for
one
night
only
he
asked
laughing
but
i
have
no
brother
she
replied
then
as
your
husband
brother
he
suggested
that
would
be
better
still
as
he
is
an
american
and
not
known
here
do
you
really
think
it
best
to
save
you
annoyance
i
think
it
is
a
pardonable
deception
what
is
his
name
richard
but
i
do
know
much
about
him
then
we
will
consider
that
that
is
settled
he
said
cheerfully
and
without
giving
her
time
to
argue
the
matter
summoned
a
fly
which
presently
deposited
them
bag
and
baggage
at
the
hotel
door
to
make
assurance
doubly
sure
he
hastened
to
sign
their
names
in
the
book
robert
allingford
christchurch
england
richard
allingford
can
you
give
my
sister
and
me
good
rooms
for
he
asked
the
landlady
yes
sir
two
nice
rooms
just
opposite
each
other
he
said
that
that
would
do
very
well
and
they
were
soon
installed
once
in
her
apartment
allingford
indulged
in
a
good
cry
while
scarsdale
strolled
out
before
dinner
to
have
a
smoke
and
think
it
over
he
did
not
see
much
further
use
in
telegraphing
just
at
that
moment
later
it
would
perhaps
be
well
to
send
a
message
to
basingstoke
saying
that
they
were
detained
at
winchester
and
would
come
on
next
morning
for
he
had
quickly
learned
that
scarsdale
and
allingford
would
be
able
to
leave
the
train
at
salisbury
and
justly
surmised
that
they
had
done
so
presently
having
finished
his
cigar
he
returned
to
the
hotel
to
find
allingford
ready
for
dinner
and
much
refreshed
by
her
tears
and
subsequent
ablutions
they
neither
of
them
ate
much
and
after
the
fish
they
gave
up
any
attempt
to
make
conversation
as
worse
than
useless
and
finished
the
repast
in
silence
i
afraid
she
said
as
she
folded
her
napkin
that
you
found
me
very
poor
company
i
nothing
to
boast
of
myself
he
replied
i
hope
they
are
not
as
miserable
as
we
are
she
added
as
they
rose
to
leave
the
table
i
have
been
able
to
eat
a
thing
scarsdale
did
not
reply
he
had
a
gloomy
suspicion
that
his
wife
was
making
a
very
good
meal
somewhere
not
that
he
doubted
her
love
but
he
did
not
believe
her
devotion
included
loss
of
appetite
do
you
think
they
are
miserable
she
queried
uneasy
at
his
silence
not
so
miserable
as
we
are
he
said
they
are
both
americans
you
see
and
americans
do
take
things
seriously
as
a
rule
what
do
you
suppose
they
are
doing
was
her
next
question
seated
swinging
their
feet
over
the
edge
of
salisbury
platform
finishing
my
box
of
american
candy
he
said
she
tried
to
be
amused
and
even
forced
a
little
laugh
but
it
was
a
dismal
failure
and
realising
it
she
at
once
excused
herself
and
retired
to
her
room
for
the
night
leaving
scarsdale
to
pass
the
evening
as
best
he
could
he
approved
of
her
circumspection
but
it
was
beastly
dull
and
as
he
sat
smoking
in
the
winter
garden
which
the
hotel
boasted
he
felt
that
he
should
soon
become
insufferably
bored
he
presently
therefore
overcame
his
natural
reserve
sufficiently
to
respond
to
the
advances
of
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
seemed
inclined
to
be
sociable
the
stranger
was
a
florid
man
of
a
distinctively
american
type
a
person
scarsdale
would
naturally
have
avoided
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
he
felt
the
need
of
human
society
no
matter
whose
and
in
a
few
moments
they
had
drifted
into
conversation
at
first
the
subjects
under
discussion
were
harmless
enough
relating
mainly
to
winchester
and
neighbouring
points
of
interest
concerning
which
scarsdale
was
forced
to
confess
himself
ignorant
as
it
was
his
first
visit
to
the
place
before
long
however
they
began
to
touch
on
more
dangerous
ground
and
he
saw
that
even
with
a
casual
acquaintance
of
this
sort
he
must
be
guarded
if
he
was
to
remain
consistent
in
his
role
of
brother
to
the
deserted
bride
were
you
ever
in
america
was
the
first
question
which
startled
him
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
as
he
could
honestly
do
having
been
taken
by
his
father
to
canada
when
but
a
lad
but
the
stranger
was
not
satisfied
and
began
after
the
manner
of
his
nation
a
series
of
leading
questions
which
kept
scarsdale
busy
in
trying
to
assimilate
with
some
regard
to
truth
the
character
he
had
chosen
it
was
at
this
moment
that
a
waiter
came
to
him
and
asked
in
a
perfectly
audible
voice
if
he
was
richard
allingford
scarsdale
was
forced
to
admit
the
fact
and
to
reply
to
a
message
sent
as
the
waiter
took
unnecessary
pains
to
explain
by
your
sister
sir
excuse
me
interjected
his
companion
but
may
i
ask
if
your
name
is
robert
allingford
the
englishman
would
have
given
worlds
to
deny
the
fact
but
in
the
presence
of
the
waiter
who
still
lingered
and
in
the
face
of
the
evidence
in
the
visitors
book
only
one
course
was
open
to
him
and
he
replied
reluctantly
in
the
affirmative
wife
of
the
united
states
consul
at
christchurch
yes
said
scarsdale
now
he
could
once
more
tell
the
truth
he
felt
happier
but
he
had
a
premonition
that
all
was
not
well
and
heartily
wished
he
had
never
encouraged
this
american
who
might
know
more
than
was
convenient
why
dick
said
that
personage
leaning
across
the
little
table
that
separated
them
and
grasping
both
his
hands
why
dick
do
you
know
me
if
a
thunderbolt
had
shattered
the
floor
at
the
englishman
feet
he
could
not
have
been
more
dumfounded
the
one
seemingly
impossible
thing
had
come
to
pass
in
all
this
great
world
with
every
chance
against
it
fate
had
ordained
that
the
little
provincial
city
in
which
he
had
planned
to
play
for
one
night
only
another
man
part
should
also
contain
one
of
that
man
friends
and
they
two
had
met
he
was
so
staggered
as
the
possibilities
contingent
on
this
mischance
crowded
through
his
brain
that
he
could
only
stammer
out
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
well
i
do
much
wonder
continued
his
friend
if
i
have
changed
as
much
in
fifteen
years
as
you
have
it
is
strange
you
did
recognise
me
lord
i
never
have
known
you
if
you
had
told
me
who
you
were
you
must
do
me
as
great
a
favour
said
scarsdale
regaining
a
little
of
his
if
so
long
a
time
had
elapsed
since
their
last
meeting
he
felt
that
things
were
not
so
bad
after
all
and
that
he
could
reasonably
hope
to
bluff
it
out
well
said
the
other
the
boys
used
to
call
me
faro
charlie
now
you
remember
the
englishman
tried
to
look
as
if
he
did
and
the
american
proceeded
to
further
elucidate
matters
by
saying
why
surely
you
ai
forgotten
me
as
was
your
pal
out
to
red
dog
the
time
you
was
prospecting
for
copper
and
struck
gold
no
no
said
scarsdale
of
course
i
remember
you
now
he
could
be
supposed
to
have
forgotten
such
an
event
he
felt
but
the
whole
affair
was
most
unfortunate
i
guess
you
settled
down
and
become
pious
from
the
looks
of
you
continued
faro
charlie
but
you
have
a
drink
for
old
times
sake
just
the
same
no
thanks
you
must
excuse
me
he
replied
feeling
that
he
must
drop
this
unwelcome
friend
as
soon
as
possible
but
the
friend
had
no
intention
of
being
dropped
and
contented
himself
by
saying
rats
and
ordering
two
whiskies
why
i
known
the
day
he
continued
when
slippery
dick
we
used
to
call
you
slippery
dick
you
remember
you
could
cheat
worse
at
poker
than
any
man
in
the
camp
scarsdale
writhed
well
as
i
was
saying
you
have
shot
a
man
then
who
refused
to
drink
with
you
the
englishman
sat
aghast
little
had
he
thought
he
was
impersonating
a
and
a
wholesale
murderer
the
whisky
came
and
he
drank
it
feeling
that
he
needed
a
bracer
now
said
faro
charlie
i
want
to
hear
all
about
what
you
been
doing
first
and
last
tending
i
heered
out
to
michigan
this
the
englishman
felt
was
going
too
far
it
was
bad
enough
to
have
to
impersonate
such
a
fellow
as
slippery
dick
but
to
endow
him
with
a
fictitious
history
that
was
at
all
comparable
with
faro
account
of
his
earlier
years
required
too
great
an
effort
of
imagination
and
the
fact
that
a
quiet
little
man
who
was
sitting
near
by
edged
up
his
chair
and
seemed
deeply
interested
in
the
conversation
did
not
tend
to
put
him
more
at
his
ease
no
wonder
he
thought
the
consul
did
not
talk
much
about
his
brother
he
therefore
hastened
to
change
the
subject
have
you
seen
much
of
the
indians
lately
he
ventured
it
seemed
such
a
safe
topic
thinking
of
that
little
squaw
you
was
so
chummy
with
down
to
injun
reservation
queried
his
friend
punching
him
jovially
in
the
ribs
you
knew
did
you
that
they
had
her
up
for
to
fort
smith
reckon
as
they
a
hung
her
if
she
had
been
a
woman
she
was
a
limb
guess
you
had
your
hands
full
when
you
tackled
her
scarsdale
decided
his
choice
of
a
subject
had
not
been
fortunate
and
begged
faro
charlie
to
have
some
more
whisky
sure
replied
that
individual
drink
with
you
all
night
i
afraid
you
ca
do
that
replied
scarsdale
hastening
to
rid
himself
of
his
unwelcome
friend
i
have
some
important
business
to
attend
to
this
evening
i
wish
you
were
in
such
a
rush
come
back
and
we
paint
the
town
eh
scarsdale
thought
it
extremely
unlikely
and
shaking
hands
fled
to
the
street
with
a
sigh
of
relief
for
he
had
had
a
very
bad
quarter
of
an
hour
what
cursed
luck
that
he
should
have
run
across
this
american
horror
he
must
avoid
him
at
all
costs
morning
in
his
hurry
he
had
not
noticed
that
the
quiet
little
man
had
left
the
winter
garden
with
him
his
one
thought
was
to
get
away
he
determined
to
send
that
telegram
to
basingstoke
at
once
and
go
to
bed
before
any
one
else
recognised
him
one
of
slippery
dick
friends
was
enough
but
unkind
fate
had
not
yet
done
with
him
and
a
new
and
more
terrible
surprise
was
in
store
for
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
he
had
scarcely
gone
a
dozen
yards
from
the
hotel
entrance
when
a
voice
said
just
beside
him
excuse
me
richard
allingford
but
may
i
have
a
few
words
with
you
scarsdale
turned
and
finding
himself
face
to
face
with
the
quiet
little
man
who
had
seemed
so
interested
in
his
conversation
of
a
few
moments
ago
said
i
seem
to
be
in
great
demand
why
do
you
wish
to
see
me
i
do
know
you
no
said
the
man
who
stood
beside
him
no
you
do
not
know
me
richard
allingford
but
you
will
he
was
a
quiet
unpretending
little
man
but
there
was
something
about
his
dress
and
bearing
and
the
snap
with
which
he
shut
his
jaw
at
the
end
of
a
sentence
an
air
of
decision
in
short
which
caused
the
englishman
to
feel
that
he
would
do
well
to
conciliate
this
stranger
whoever
he
might
be
so
he
said
shortly
what
do
you
want
with
me
speak
quickly
i
in
a
hurry
i
could
help
overhearing
some
of
your
conversation
just
now
at
the
hotel
and
so
i
took
the
liberty
of
following
you
to
ask
you
a
question
yes
said
scarsdale
interrogatively
if
i
mistake
not
you
are
the
brother
of
the
united
states
consul
at
christchurch
and
came
over
to
his
wedding
yes
he
admitted
for
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
well
deny
to
one
man
what
he
had
just
confessed
to
another
you
have
been
in
england
about
ten
days
i
think
as
long
as
that
certainly
may
i
ask
what
ship
you
came
on
by
what
right
do
you
ask
me
these
questions
you
will
see
presently
but
suppose
i
refuse
to
answer
them
the
unknown
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
quietly
now
was
it
the
yes
said
scarsdale
who
remembered
with
joy
having
seen
that
fact
chronicled
in
a
london
paper
i
suppose
you
have
never
been
in
winchester
before
never
in
my
life
not
last
week
look
here
said
scarsdale
angrily
what
the
devil
are
you
driving
at
it
is
a
pity
you
should
have
such
a
good
memory
for
past
and
not
for
recent
events
said
the
quiet
little
man
a
great
pity
i
tell
you
i
have
never
been
here
did
dine
at
the
lion
head
last
wednesday
for
instance
no
i
did
not
and
i
had
enough
of
this
insolence
so
have
i
said
the
little
man
blowing
a
little
whistle
so
have
i
and
therefore
i
arrest
you
richard
allingford
in
the
queen
name
chapter
vii
in
which
scarsdale
reaps
another
whirlwind
scarsdale
was
absolutely
staggered
by
the
word
arrest
arrest
what
nonsense
who
was
this
man
who
talked
of
arresting
harold
scarsdale
peaceably
engaged
in
trying
to
find
his
wife
and
proceed
on
his
honeymoon
the
first
sensations
of
surprise
and
incredulity
were
quickly
followed
however
by
a
realisation
of
the
horrible
situation
in
which
his
own
stupidity
had
placed
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
he
was
not
harold
scarsdale
but
richard
allingford
and
he
shuddered
to
think
with
what
crime
he
might
be
charged
for
from
what
he
had
learned
in
the
last
he
could
not
doubt
that
he
was
posing
as
one
of
the
most
abandoned
characters
that
had
ever
visited
the
town
of
winchester
a
person
who
consorted
with
cheated
at
cards
and
thought
nothing
of
shooting
friends
who
were
not
thirsty
would
surely
be
satisfied
with
no
ordinary
crime
of
what
was
he
accused
he
hardly
dared
to
ask
and
how
was
he
to
get
out
of
this
dreadful
dilemma
his
reflections
however
were
cut
short
by
the
arrival
of
a
burly
policeman
in
answer
to
his
captor
whistle
the
little
man
at
once
addressed
the
newcomer
quite
ignoring
scarsdale
here
your
man
allingford
not
a
doubt
of
it
he
said
got
your
warrant
inquired
the
policeman
laying
a
detaining
hand
on
the
prisoner
shoulder
here
it
is
replied
the
first
speaker
producing
a
paper
which
the
officer
glanced
at
and
returned
saying
at
the
same
time
to
scarsdale
now
then
come
along
o
me
and
do
make
no
resistance
if
you
knows
what
good
for
you
i
do
not
intend
to
offer
any
resistance
replied
that
gentleman
and
turning
to
the
little
man
he
asked
by
what
right
do
you
arrest
me
and
on
what
charge
i
private
detective
smithers
replied
his
captor
and
this
again
producing
the
paper
he
had
already
shown
to
the
policeman
is
my
warrant
you
know
the
charge
well
enough
i
entirely
ignorant
of
it
cried
scarsdale
hotly
of
course
said
the
detective
they
always
are
and
he
winked
at
the
officer
i
tell
you
i
do
know
anything
about
it
reiterated
the
unfortunate
bridegroom
i
must
caution
you
remarked
the
policeman
that
anything
you
says
may
be
used
against
you
as
evidence
i
demand
to
know
why
i
am
arrested
i
have
a
right
to
do
so
tell
him
bill
said
the
detective
and
stop
his
row
the
officer
thus
admonished
nodded
his
head
and
replied
shortly
two
charges
and
battery
on
the
landlord
of
the
lion
head
and
disturbing
the
peace
on
last
wednesday
night
i
deny
the
charge
cried
scarsdale
of
course
you
do
replied
the
policeman
i
suppose
you
would
now
you
had
your
say
are
you
coming
along
peaceable
or
are
you
not
certainly
i
am
replied
the
prisoner
and
they
started
up
the
street
followed
by
a
small
crowd
which
had
already
collected
i
must
warn
you
continued
scarsdale
when
they
were
fairly
under
way
that
you
are
making
a
mistake
i
am
not
the
man
you
take
me
for
i
suppose
you
deny
your
name
is
richard
allingford
next
said
the
detective
laughing
i
do
deny
it
well
i
blessed
remarked
his
captor
the
policeman
simply
said
come
on
that
too
thin
and
jerked
him
roughly
by
the
arm
scarsdale
quickened
his
pace
saying
angrily
if
you
only
give
a
man
a
chance
to
explain
you
have
chance
enough
when
you
come
up
to
explain
to
the
court
replied
the
officer
and
a
pretty
bill
of
damages
into
the
bargain
oh
if
it
only
a
fine
remarked
the
prisoner
feeling
much
relieved
i
pay
it
and
welcome
rather
than
have
a
row
maybe
you
wo
have
the
option
replied
one
of
his
captors
while
the
other
added
cheerfully
what
you
needs
is
thirty
days
and
i
you
get
it
at
the
police
court
scarsdale
did
not
help
his
case
by
insisting
on
giving
his
right
name
and
denying
all
knowledge
of
the
charge
his
statements
were
entered
against
him
he
was
relieved
of
his
watch
purse
and
jewellery
and
introduced
to
the
cold
comforts
of
the
on
being
asked
if
he
wished
to
communicate
with
any
one
he
replied
that
the
next
morning
would
be
quite
time
enough
for
he
knew
that
allingford
could
give
him
little
help
in
his
present
predicament
and
he
did
not
wish
to
disturb
her
night
rest
to
no
purpose
it
can
be
well
imagined
that
the
accommodations
of
an
english
provincial
prison
are
not
luxurious
but
the
room
was
clean
and
fortune
favoured
him
in
that
he
had
only
two
companions
both
of
whom
were
stupid
drunk
and
went
to
sleep
very
peaceably
on
the
floor
scarsdale
improvised
a
bed
on
a
settee
and
using
his
coat
as
a
pillow
passed
a
fairly
comfortable
night
luckily
he
was
of
a
somewhat
phlegmatic
temperament
and
withal
very
tired
after
the
day
exertions
so
in
spite
of
the
misfortunes
which
were
crowding
about
him
he
was
able
to
resign
himself
to
the
inevitable
and
eventually
to
drop
off
to
sleep
early
next
morning
however
he
arranged
to
have
a
note
delivered
to
allingford
at
the
hotel
in
which
he
informed
that
lady
of
his
unfortunate
predicament
begging
her
not
to
distress
herself
on
his
account
and
assuring
her
that
in
all
probability
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
a
trifling
fine
and
that
he
should
be
at
liberty
to
rejoin
her
within
a
few
hours
he
felt
very
little
of
what
he
wrote
but
as
long
as
there
was
a
chance
of
things
coming
out
right
he
wished
to
spare
her
all
possible
worry
his
ready
money
procured
him
a
better
breakfast
than
he
could
have
hoped
for
and
by
nine
when
the
court
opened
he
was
refreshed
and
ready
for
whatever
might
befall
his
two
companions
in
misfortune
preceded
him
for
trial
but
their
cases
were
soon
disposed
of
and
harold
scarsdale
richard
allingford
was
put
into
the
dock
the
consisted
of
a
plainly
furnished
apartment
containing
a
raised
platform
at
one
end
on
which
were
placed
the
desk
and
armchair
of
the
police
magistrate
while
in
front
were
several
rows
of
benches
for
the
accommodation
of
the
public
but
as
the
cases
were
of
no
general
interest
scarsdale
was
relieved
to
see
that
the
attendance
was
meagre
allingford
was
present
however
looking
very
white
and
distressed
but
managing
to
muster
up
a
smile
to
greet
him
as
he
entered
the
proceedings
were
short
and
to
the
point
the
police
constable
on
being
called
and
given
the
oath
kissed
the
book
and
deposed
that
at
about
a
quarter
to
nine
on
the
previous
evening
while
on
his
accustomed
beat
he
had
been
summoned
by
private
detective
smithers
to
aid
in
arresting
the
prisoner
who
had
professed
ignorance
of
the
charge
the
truth
of
which
he
afterwards
denied
and
who
persisted
in
asserting
that
he
was
not
richard
allingford
private
detective
smithers
now
took
the
stand
and
stated
the
case
from
his
point
of
view
which
was
in
short
that
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
at
the
hotel
between
the
prisoner
and
another
person
here
present
and
the
statement
which
the
prisoner
made
to
him
personally
proved
that
he
was
without
doubt
the
richard
allingford
mentioned
in
the
indictment
in
conclusion
he
begged
that
the
person
styling
himself
faro
charlie
should
be
summoned
to
corroborate
his
testimony
faro
charlie
was
accordingly
called
and
placed
in
the
dock
and
after
the
usual
preliminaries
the
magistrate
examined
him
as
follows
what
is
your
name
faro
charlie
any
other
name
smith
very
well
charles
smith
are
you
a
citizen
of
the
united
states
i
be
of
what
occupation
miner
do
you
recognise
the
prisoner
as
the
person
whom
you
met
at
the
george
last
evening
i
do
can
you
swear
that
he
is
richard
allingford
no
scarsdale
heart
leaped
at
that
no
salvation
was
at
hand
after
all
the
magistrate
continued
do
you
believe
this
person
to
be
richard
allingford
yes
on
the
whole
i
think
i
do
the
prisoner
heart
sank
but
continued
the
witness
i
ca
be
sure
fifteen
years
is
a
long
time
i
would
have
known
him
if
he
had
owned
up
to
his
name
he
might
be
playing
me
for
a
sucker
in
other
words
you
think
the
prisoner
to
be
richard
allingford
but
are
unwilling
to
swear
to
his
identity
that
the
stuff
replied
faro
charlie
i
swored
as
a
man
was
my
uncle
three
years
ago
at
and
he
put
a
bullet
into
me
next
day
i
lost
him
the
case
after
which
i
ai
swearing
against
a
pal
and
he
left
the
stand
the
case
now
proceeded
and
the
detective
related
how
on
wednesday
the
of
october
the
prisoner
richard
allingford
in
company
with
other
lawless
characters
had
dined
at
the
lion
head
and
during
a
dispute
with
the
landlord
concerning
the
quality
of
the
wine
had
thrown
that
personage
out
of
his
own
window
telling
his
wife
who
protested
against
such
actions
to
put
her
husband
in
the
bill
which
they
left
without
settling
then
they
proceeded
to
paint
the
town
of
winchester
a
lurid
crimson
breaking
windows
beating
a
policeman
who
interfered
and
raiding
a
night
in
the
process
this
recital
of
wrong
and
outrage
being
finished
the
magistrate
addressed
the
prisoner
as
follows
what
is
your
name
harold
stanley
malcolm
hubart
scarsdale
some
one
in
the
audience
murmured
o
lor
you
refuse
to
admit
that
your
name
is
richard
allingford
continued
the
justice
i
have
just
given
you
my
name
are
you
an
american
no
i
am
an
englishman
where
do
you
live
towers
sussex
the
audience
again
voiced
its
sentiments
this
time
to
the
effect
that
the
prisoner
was
a
swell
but
order
was
restored
and
the
case
once
more
proceeded
what
is
your
profession
i
am
a
clerk
in
the
war
office
does
not
that
interfere
with
the
management
of
your
estate
asked
his
interlocutor
to
whom
the
last
two
statements
savoured
of
contradiction
i
have
just
succeeded
to
the
estate
through
the
death
of
an
elder
brother
ah
i
see
now
in
regard
to
last
evening
do
you
admit
meeting
at
the
george
the
person
who
calls
himself
charles
smith
yes
did
not
you
represent
yourself
to
him
as
being
richard
allingford
yes
this
reply
caused
a
sensation
in
the
court
i
suppose
said
the
magistrate
that
you
realise
that
this
is
a
serious
admission
it
is
the
truth
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
i
assumed
the
name
said
scarsdale
with
an
effort
to
screen
from
possible
annoyance
a
lady
who
was
under
my
protection
with
the
permission
of
the
court
however
i
should
prefer
not
to
go
into
this
matter
further
as
it
has
no
direct
bearing
on
the
charge
my
action
was
foolish
and
i
have
been
punished
for
it
you
certainly
chose
an
unfortunate
alias
commented
the
magistrate
drily
and
much
to
the
prisoner
relief
turned
to
another
phase
of
the
case
what
are
you
doing
in
winchester
i
am
on
my
honeymoon
i
was
married
yesterday
a
titter
of
laughter
ran
round
the
but
the
magistrate
frowned
and
continued
i
suppose
that
is
the
reason
why
you
registered
under
an
assumed
name
and
are
travelling
with
somebody
else
wife
there
was
more
laughter
for
the
justice
had
a
local
reputation
as
a
wit
scarsdale
boiled
inwardly
but
held
his
peace
while
his
judge
who
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
strayed
a
little
from
the
subject
in
hand
after
a
moment
silence
asked
shortly
do
you
plead
guilty
or
not
guilty
to
these
charges
not
guilty
do
you
wish
this
matter
settled
here
or
in
a
superior
court
i
desire
that
it
be
settled
here
provided
i
am
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
my
identity
you
will
be
given
every
reasonable
opportunity
what
do
you
wish
i
wish
to
ask
first
by
whom
these
charges
are
preferred
the
charge
of
assault
and
battery
has
been
brought
by
the
landlord
of
the
lion
head
i
infer
that
the
landlord
served
richard
allingford
in
person
on
the
night
in
question
and
would
be
likely
to
know
him
if
he
saw
him
the
magistrate
conferred
with
the
detective
and
replied
that
such
was
the
case
if
the
question
is
not
out
of
order
resumed
the
prisoner
may
i
ask
if
the
landlord
of
the
lion
head
is
a
reputable
witness
and
one
whose
testimony
might
be
relied
on
i
think
you
may
trust
yourself
in
his
hands
replied
the
justice
who
had
seen
all
along
whither
the
case
was
tending
then
said
scarsdale
i
shall
be
satisfied
to
rest
my
case
on
his
identification
that
is
quite
a
proper
request
replied
the
magistrate
is
the
landlord
of
the
lion
head
present
at
this
a
dapper
little
man
jumped
up
in
the
audience
and
explained
that
he
was
the
landlord
physician
and
that
his
patient
though
convalescent
was
still
disabled
by
his
injuries
and
unable
to
attend
court
on
inquiry
being
made
as
to
when
he
could
put
in
an
appearance
the
physician
replied
that
he
thought
the
landlord
could
come
the
next
day
the
magistrate
therefore
consulted
for
a
moment
with
the
detective
and
then
said
to
the
prisoner
your
case
is
remanded
for
trial
until
scarsdale
held
up
his
hand
in
token
that
he
wished
to
speak
well
said
the
magistrate
what
else
if
i
can
by
the
time
this
court
meets
produce
reputable
witnesses
from
london
to
prove
my
identity
asked
the
prisoner
will
their
evidence
be
admitted
if
they
can
identify
themselves
as
such
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
yes
the
magistrate
thereupon
dismissed
the
case
and
scarsdale
was
removed
from
the
he
felt
he
had
come
off
singularly
well
and
except
for
the
annoyance
and
delay
would
have
little
further
trouble
what
he
most
desired
was
an
interview
with
allingford
but
what
with
a
change
in
his
quarters
owing
to
the
deferment
of
the
trial
and
the
difficulty
of
getting
word
to
her
it
was
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
before
this
was
accomplished
the
unfortunate
little
woman
seemed
completely
broken
down
by
this
fresh
disaster
and
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
control
herself
sufficiently
to
talk
calmly
with
him
i
shall
never
never
forgive
myself
she
sobbed
it
is
all
my
fault
that
you
have
incurred
this
disgrace
i
can
never
look
your
wife
in
the
face
again
nonsense
he
said
trying
to
cheer
her
up
there
is
no
disgrace
in
being
arrested
for
what
somebody
else
has
done
and
as
for
its
being
your
fault
why
it
was
i
who
proposed
to
pass
myself
off
as
your
husband
brother
but
i
allowed
it
only
i
did
not
know
anything
about
my
except
that
he
existed
his
being
in
england
is
a
complete
surprise
to
me
a
remark
which
caused
scarsdale
to
be
thankful
that
he
had
said
nothing
to
her
about
that
scene
at
the
club
when
the
consul
heard
of
dick
arrival
he
must
be
very
wicked
i
so
sorry
but
we
wo
talk
about
him
now
we
will
talk
about
you
what
can
i
do
to
retrieve
myself
she
continued
let
us
consider
your
own
affairs
first
he
replied
i
was
able
to
send
a
telegram
to
basingstoke
last
night
i
was
arrested
on
my
way
to
the
office
i
sent
one
though
this
morning
right
after
the
trial
i
did
know
that
you
knew
where
to
go
he
said
i
did
she
returned
but
that
queer
american
person
who
swear
to
your
identity
sent
it
for
me
he
is
very
odd
but
i
sure
he
has
a
good
heart
he
was
so
distressed
over
the
whole
affair
and
offered
to
be
of
any
assistance
he
could
oh
said
scarsdale
he
was
not
in
faro
charlie
favour
so
i
think
she
went
on
that
if
they
are
at
basingstoke
they
will
be
here
in
a
few
hours
i
told
them
all
about
your
arrest
and
where
i
was
staying
so
far
so
good
allingford
can
identify
me
even
to
the
satisfaction
of
this
magistrate
i
think
but
it
is
just
as
well
to
have
two
strings
to
one
bow
so
i
have
another
plan
to
suggest
but
first
let
me
hear
if
you
have
done
anything
else
no
but
i
think
i
shall
telegraph
to
my
mother
i
ca
spend
another
night
here
alone
why
do
you
wait
and
see
if
your
husband
does
not
turn
up
i
hate
to
give
our
affairs
more
publicity
than
is
necessary
he
suggested
would
you
prefer
me
to
do
so
yes
very
much
if
you
do
mind
then
i
will
i
think
after
my
share
in
this
unfortunate
business
you
ought
to
have
the
first
consideration
now
tell
me
your
plan
i
propose
that
we
telegraph
to
your
husband
best
man
jack
carrington
asking
him
to
come
to
winchester
this
evening
he
can
identify
me
and
identify
himself
also
for
he
has
a
brother
who
is
an
officer
in
one
of
the
regiments
stationed
here
just
the
thing
she
cried
i
send
it
at
once
no
replied
scarsdale
you
write
it
and
i
send
it
he
did
not
wish
any
more
of
his
plans
to
be
revealed
to
faro
charlie
chapter
viii
in
which
a
serious
charge
is
laid
at
the
consul
door
jack
carrington
esquire
gentleman
sat
in
his
snug
little
in
one
of
the
side
streets
of
mayfair
shortly
before
seven
in
the
evening
feeling
uncommonly
blue
he
was
without
doubt
in
a
most
unfortunate
position
born
and
bred
a
gentleman
educated
to
do
nothing
yet
debarred
by
lack
of
family
influence
from
the
two
professions
he
might
properly
have
entered
the
army
and
the
diplomatic
corps
with
not
quite
enough
money
to
support
his
position
as
a
bachelor
and
no
hopes
of
ever
having
any
more
the
outlook
matrimonially
at
least
was
anything
but
encouraging
and
there
was
a
lady
with
whose
existence
this
narrative
has
no
concern
who
had
fortune
smiled
might
now
be
carrington
a
possibility
which
had
brought
our
quondam
best
man
almost
to
the
point
of
determining
according
to
those
false
standards
which
are
happily
fast
passing
away
from
english
society
to
be
no
longer
a
but
to
go
into
trade
such
then
was
his
condition
when
the
rang
and
a
moment
later
a
card
was
brought
to
him
bearing
the
name
of
lady
scarsdale
he
looked
at
it
scarcely
believing
his
eyes
how
came
it
that
she
should
call
on
him
at
an
hour
so
strikingly
unconventional
it
was
therefore
with
no
little
bewilderment
that
he
gave
orders
to
have
her
shown
in
when
her
ladyship
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
entered
his
parlour
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
strikingly
handsome
woman
of
middle
age
dressed
in
she
accepted
his
outstretched
hand
held
it
a
second
and
taking
the
seat
he
offered
said
with
just
a
glance
in
the
direction
of
a
demure
little
woman
who
followed
her
into
the
room
miss
wilkins
carrington
bowed
and
miss
wilkins
maid
or
attendant
whichever
she
might
be
retired
to
the
remote
end
of
the
room
and
promptly
immersed
herself
in
the
only
volume
within
reach
a
french
novel
which
jack
felt
sure
she
had
never
seen
before
and
would
not
be
likely
to
peruse
to
any
great
extent
you
will
naturally
be
surprised
at
my
presence
here
this
evening
said
lady
scarsdale
her
host
bowed
and
smiled
to
show
that
pleasure
and
gratification
were
mingled
indeed
until
she
further
declared
her
position
he
hardly
knew
how
he
ought
to
feel
her
ladyship
continued
my
object
in
coming
is
unusual
it
is
in
short
to
request
your
aid
and
assistance
in
a
very
extraordinary
and
delicate
matter
jack
bowed
again
and
his
visitor
proceeded
you
will
excuse
me
if
i
seem
agitated
she
certainly
did
seem
very
much
so
if
red
eyes
and
a
quivering
lip
meant
anything
but
i
have
scarcely
recovered
from
the
shock
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
a
telegram
received
this
morning
from
a
allingford
at
whose
marriage
i
think
you
assisted
i
was
his
best
man
so
i
understand
nothing
wrong
i
hope
that
you
shall
hear
do
you
know
my
son
mr
scarsdale
only
slightly
you
may
be
aware
that
he
was
married
yesterday
jack
nodded
and
she
continued
to
a
miss
vernon
an
american
you
know
her
i
believe
quite
well
replied
her
host
she
is
a
most
charming
woman
now
this
allingford
telegraphs
me
resumed
his
visitor
from
my
aunt
lady
melton
country
seat
melton
court
that
he
is
staying
there
with
my
son
wife
who
was
miss
vernon
staying
there
with
allingford
at
melton
court
gasped
jack
to
whom
this
seemed
the
most
improbable
combination
of
circumstances
but
where
is
her
husband
i
regret
to
say
replied
her
ladyship
that
as
a
result
of
the
two
couples
meeting
each
other
at
basingstoke
they
in
some
way
became
separated
and
carried
off
in
different
trains
so
that
my
and
allingford
are
now
at
my
aunt
country
place
near
salisbury
while
my
son
and
allingford
have
gone
off
together
somewhere
on
the
south
coast
and
no
trace
can
be
found
of
them
but
how
did
it
happen
the
whole
affair
seems
to
have
been
the
result
of
some
deplorable
blunder
or
accident
but
in
any
event
it
is
most
distressing
and
i
came
up
at
once
to
london
thinking
you
might
be
able
to
help
me
but
i
see
from
your
surprise
that
you
have
heard
nothing
from
either
party
not
a
word
but
i
am
quite
at
your
service
thanks
you
may
not
know
that
actuated
by
a
spirit
which
i
can
not
admire
my
son
wife
and
your
friend
each
insisted
on
arranging
the
details
of
their
wedding
trips
and
keeping
the
matter
a
profound
secret
so
that
neither
allingford
nor
my
son
knew
their
destination
yes
i
have
heard
something
of
it
but
i
infer
that
you
have
not
honoured
me
by
this
visit
without
the
hope
that
i
may
be
able
to
aid
you
pray
tell
me
how
i
can
be
of
service
my
chief
desire
in
calling
on
you
carrington
was
to
learn
if
you
had
had
any
news
of
my
son
or
his
wife
but
of
course
on
my
journey
to
town
i
have
been
thinking
of
various
expedients
and
though
i
hesitate
to
ask
so
great
a
favour
from
one
i
hardly
know
you
could
i
think
be
of
great
assistance
to
me
with
pleasure
do
you
wish
me
to
telegraph
to
allingford
or
go
in
search
of
your
son
neither
but
i
should
be
very
grateful
to
you
if
you
would
go
for
me
to
melton
court
i
have
not
myself
sufficient
strength
for
the
journey
it
is
already
late
and
i
have
no
one
to
send
but
i
feel
that
my
is
in
an
anomalous
and
probably
unpleasant
position
so
as
i
knew
you
to
be
a
friend
of
both
parties
i
thought
that
perhaps
you
would
be
good
enough
to
represent
me
and
see
what
could
be
done
towards
the
solution
of
this
unfortunate
problem
my
son
best
man
left
for
the
continent
immediately
after
the
ceremony
or
i
would
have
gone
to
him
instead
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
better
than
to
serve
you
replied
jack
but
to
speak
frankly
i
have
not
the
honour
of
knowing
lady
melton
if
you
will
permit
me
to
use
your
desk
i
will
give
you
a
line
of
introduction
carrington
bowed
his
consent
now
she
said
giving
him
the
note
when
can
you
leave
at
once
he
replied
by
the
first
train
you
will
of
course
act
as
you
think
best
she
continued
i
am
staying
at
the
berkeley
for
and
if
mabel
husband
has
not
rejoined
her
before
you
arrive
you
had
better
bring
her
to
me
there
as
you
are
going
on
my
behalf
you
must
of
course
let
me
bear
all
expenses
of
the
trip
on
this
ground
her
ladyship
was
firm
in
spite
of
protestations
and
they
finally
parted
with
many
expressions
of
gratitude
on
a
mutual
and
highly
satisfactory
understanding
as
jack
employed
a
valet
only
on
state
occasions
he
was
after
a
hurried
dinner
deep
in
his
preparations
for
immediate
departure
when
about
eight
allingford
telegram
from
winchester
arrived
which
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
say
startled
him
considerably
the
news
that
scarsdale
was
under
arrest
for
the
crime
of
another
person
and
the
fact
that
it
lay
in
his
power
to
free
him
seemed
to
prove
without
doubt
that
his
first
duty
was
to
go
to
winchester
but
he
had
promised
lady
scarsdale
to
go
to
melton
court
and
it
was
impossible
to
do
both
that
night
he
was
uncertain
how
to
act
and
what
his
ultimate
decision
would
have
been
it
is
difficult
to
say
had
not
an
outside
influence
decided
matters
for
him
another
caller
was
announced
i
not
at
home
ca
see
anybody
said
carrington
that
not
true
young
man
and
you
got
to
see
me
replied
a
voice
and
as
the
door
opened
to
his
astonishment
aunt
eliza
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
which
was
littered
with
his
toilet
articles
why
miss
cogbill
he
exclaimed
rising
to
greet
her
i
thought
you
were
in
paris
so
i
should
be
if
i
had
been
stopped
at
calais
by
a
telegram
from
that
consul
of
yours
allingford
then
you
know
where
they
are
yes
and
of
all
the
fools
i
also
heard
from
scarsdale
and
mrs
allingford
you
have
where
are
they
winchester
winchester
what
are
they
doing
there
he
been
arrested
arrested
yes
sit
down
and
i
tell
you
about
it
which
he
proceeded
to
do
and
also
about
lady
scarsdale
visit
just
so
commented
aunt
eliza
when
he
had
finished
now
what
do
you
propose
doing
next
i
suppose
the
proper
thing
would
be
to
put
the
two
couples
in
communication
with
each
other
suggested
jack
well
i
not
so
sure
she
said
you
and
i
are
the
only
ones
who
know
all
the
facts
and
we
must
not
act
in
a
hurry
now
there
allingford
and
mabel
down
at
melton
court
they
keep
till
i
guess
it
would
just
spoil
her
night
rest
to
know
that
her
husband
was
in
jail
at
winchester
and
send
her
over
to
him
by
the
first
train
morning
like
as
not
to
weep
on
his
neck
and
complicate
the
course
of
justice
anyway
i
do
think
the
two
couples
had
better
meet
till
we
are
present
to
soothe
their
ruffled
feelings
for
after
the
mess
that
the
consul
brother
has
got
them
into
i
dare
say
that
left
to
themselves
the
scarsdales
and
allingfords
would
be
real
cordial
to
each
other
but
i
see
you
are
packing
up
now
where
are
you
going
i
was
going
down
to
salisbury
at
lady
scarsdale
request
you
needed
elsewhere
you
go
right
down
to
winchester
this
evening
so
as
you
can
be
there
when
the
court
opens
first
thing
morning
to
identify
my
nephew
liberate
him
and
send
him
and
allingford
over
to
melton
court
as
soon
as
you
can
i
be
there
before
you
to
break
the
news
to
mabel
well
you
see
he
said
i
promised
her
ladyship
never
mind
that
your
business
is
to
fish
these
young
people
out
of
their
troubles
i
drive
at
once
to
lady
scarsdale
hotel
and
tell
her
of
your
change
of
plans
and
go
down
myself
by
the
first
train
morning
to
salisbury
then
he
said
closing
his
valise
with
a
snap
i
shall
leave
at
once
for
winchester
good
boy
said
aunt
eliza
it
too
bad
they
spoiled
you
by
making
you
a
gentleman
you
have
a
head
for
business
it
is
just
what
i
been
thinking
myself
he
said
ruefully
have
you
cried
the
old
lady
her
face
lighting
up
with
genuine
interest
i
glad
to
hear
it
you
just
put
this
matter
through
successfully
and
maybe
it
will
be
worth
more
to
you
than
your
expenses
now
i
must
be
off
and
so
must
you
very
well
i
put
up
at
the
george
he
said
as
he
helped
her
into
a
hansom
right
you
are
she
cried
and
signalled
her
driver
to
go
on
as
carrington
found
that
he
would
not
reach
winchester
till
late
he
telegraphed
allingford
that
he
would
see
her
the
next
morning
and
that
he
had
received
news
of
the
whereabouts
of
her
husband
and
scarsdale
wife
who
were
all
right
and
would
join
them
on
the
morrow
on
his
arrival
he
went
straight
to
the
hotel
that
allingford
had
designated
in
her
telegram
to
find
that
that
lady
had
retired
for
the
night
leaving
however
a
note
for
him
which
contained
full
instructions
and
stated
in
addition
that
she
had
received
his
telegram
for
which
she
was
profoundly
grateful
and
that
he
must
not
hesitate
to
wake
her
if
by
so
doing
he
could
cause
her
to
rejoin
her
husband
one
instant
sooner
as
it
was
by
this
time
close
upon
midnight
carrington
decided
to
let
matters
rest
as
they
were
till
morning
especially
as
he
had
before
he
slept
to
hunt
up
his
brother
at
the
barracks
and
so
insure
his
attendance
at
court
the
next
day
this
was
easily
arranged
but
the
two
men
had
much
to
talk
over
and
it
was
nearly
daybreak
when
jack
set
out
to
return
to
the
hotel
the
shortest
way
back
was
by
a
cross
cut
through
the
mysterious
darkness
of
the
cathedral
close
within
which
he
heard
the
voices
of
two
men
in
heated
dispute
the
tone
of
the
one
shrill
with
rage
while
those
of
the
other
proclaimed
that
he
had
been
drinking
carrington
would
have
passed
without
noticing
so
intent
was
he
on
his
own
affairs
had
not
a
name
which
one
of
them
pronounced
arrested
his
attention
and
caused
him
to
stop
you
call
robert
allingford
a
thief
came
the
thick
tones
of
the
intoxicated
man
i
say
he
stole
it
cried
the
shrill
voice
of
the
other
call
my
brother
a
thief
reiterated
the
first
speaker
consul
gentleman
gentlemen
do
steal
elephants
i
say
he
stole
it
right
away
that
day
did
wait
for
me
to
redeem
it
you
dare
to
call
my
brother
thief
the
voice
grew
menacing
twenty
pounds
he
gave
me
only
one
hundred
dollars
for
an
elephant
i
say
he
a
thief
here
the
shrill
voice
died
away
in
a
gulp
and
there
was
a
sound
of
blows
and
scuffling
carrington
forced
his
way
through
the
hedge
crying
hold
on
what
is
this
about
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
owner
of
elephants
exclaimed
the
bobbies
and
disengaging
himself
from
the
other
fled
down
the
road
while
his
companion
who
had
started
to
follow
him
was
detained
by
jack
who
recognised
his
captive
as
none
other
than
richard
allingford
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
oh
said
allingford
it
carrington
delighted
to
see
you
sure
correcting
that
fellow
says
brother
robert
stole
elephant
his
arrest
had
somewhat
sobered
him
of
course
said
carrington
he
did
steal
the
elephant
where
is
he
your
brother
yes
at
melton
court
near
salisbury
but
you
must
not
go
there
yes
i
will
replied
slippery
dick
waxing
pugnacious
take
the
elephant
fellow
along
too
make
him
eat
his
words
call
my
brother
a
thief
will
he
you
do
nothing
of
the
kind
said
his
captor
you
wanted
here
by
the
police
what
yes
for
assault
and
battery
and
disturbing
the
peace
they
have
arrested
another
man
a
scarsdale
by
mistake
in
your
place
i
do
know
anything
about
it
never
been
here
before
protested
the
unregenerate
one
well
you
must
come
along
with
me
and
give
yourself
up
or
but
carrington
never
finished
the
sentence
for
at
that
moment
he
struck
the
ground
very
hard
and
by
the
time
he
realised
that
slippery
dick
had
tripped
him
that
personage
had
disappeared
into
the
darkness
thus
justifying
his
sobriquet
jack
picked
himself
up
and
struggled
through
the
hedge
but
no
one
was
in
sight
and
the
dull
distant
sound
of
flying
feet
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
consul
brother
was
seeking
fresh
fields
and
pastures
new
with
uncommon
celerity
chapter
ix
in
which
the
consul
and
scarsdale
emulate
the
king
of
france
and
twenty
thousand
of
his
compatriots
another
day
was
dawning
a
day
that
was
destined
to
be
most
arduous
eventful
and
important
in
the
lives
of
all
those
with
whom
this
narrative
has
to
deal

hour

in

fear
for
news
of
her
husband
and
the
elephant
shrieking
in
his
these
one
and
all
entered
regretfully
upon
this
day
fraught
with
so
many
complications
carrington
had
decided
as
he
wended
his
way
home
to
the
hotel
after
his
somewhat
startling
encounter
with
the
consul
unregenerate
brother
that
he
was
in
no
wise
bound
to
report
the
matter
to
the
authorities
his
mission
was
to
extricate
scarsdale
from
unjust
imprisonment
not
to
incriminate
any
one
else
and
he
foresaw
that
any
attempt
on
his
part
to
interfere
as
an
avenger
of
justice
might
entail
subsequent
attendance
at
the
local
police
court
whenever
the
true
culprit
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
law
when
jack
had
thus
determined
on
his
course
of
action
he
resigned
himself
peacefully
to
slumber
of
which
he
stood
much
in
need
but
no
sooner
apparently
had
his
head
touched
the
pillow
than
he
was
awakened
by
a
knocking
at
his
chamber
door
in
reply
to
his
sleepy
inquiries
he
was
informed
that
allingford
was
up
and
in
the
and
would
much
appreciate
it
if
she
could
see
him
as
soon
as
possible
carrington
replied
that
he
would
be
happy
to
wait
on
her
in
a
few
minutes
as
soon
as
he
was
dressed
in
fact
and
cursed
himself
heartily
for
having
been
fool
enough
to
be
any
one
best
man
six
it
was
inhuman
to
call
him
up
at
such
a
time
he
had
not
had
three
sleep
he
wished
himself
at
melton
court
more
than
ever
there
at
least
they
rose
at
decent
hours
as
he
entered
the
hotel
a
few
minutes
later
in
a
somewhat
calmer
frame
of
mind
due
to
a
bath
and
a
cup
of
coffee
allingford
rose
to
meet
him
took
both
his
hands
in
hers
and
holding
them
tightly
stood
for
a
moment
with
her
upturned
eyes
looking
fixedly
into
his
he
would
never
have
known
her
for
the
happy
bride
of
two
short
days
ago
she
seemed
more
like
a
widow
years
older
and
with
all
the
joy
of
her
youth
crushed
out
by
trouble
words
can
not
express
what
your
coming
means
to
me
it
is
the
kindest
thing
you
ever
done
she
said
simply
but
her
tone
and
manner
told
him
of
her
gratitude
and
relief
it
is
very
little
to
do
he
replied
feeling
all
at
once
that
he
had
been
a
brute
not
to
have
seen
her
the
night
before
my
husband
oh
tell
me
about
my
husband
she
exclaimed
dropping
all
restraint
what
a
child
she
was
in
spite
of
her
he
thought
but
he
felt
very
sorry
for
her
and
answered
gently
i
blame
myself
for
not
telling
you
sooner
he
is
safe
and
well
thank
god
she
murmured
and
at
present
at
melton
court
the
country
place
of
lady
melton
scarsdale
and
then
he
told
her
such
of
her
adventures
as
he
knew
when
is
the
first
train
to
salisbury
she
cried
interrupting
the
recital
i
dare
say
there
is
an
early
morning
train
he
returned
but
i
should
suggest
your
waiting
for
the
one
at
as
then
scarsdale
can
accompany
you
but
he
is
in
prison
yes
i
know
but
he
wo
be
very
long
you
are
sure
they
will
release
him
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
i
have
arranged
all
that
now
tell
me
more
about
my
husband
everything
you
know
poor
bob
if
he
has
suffered
as
i
have
he
must
indeed
be
wretched
jack
was
morally
sure
that
the
consul
had
done
nothing
of
the
kind
but
he
forbore
to
say
so
not
that
he
doubted
for
a
moment
that
allingford
loved
his
wife
ardently
but
he
knew
him
to
be
a
somewhat
personage
who
when
he
could
not
have
things
as
he
wanted
them
resigned
himself
to
making
the
best
of
things
as
they
were
from
what
he
knew
of
scarsdale
moreover
he
thought
it
safe
to
conclude
that
she
had
resigned
herself
to
the
exigencies
of
the
case
and
that
both
of
them
looked
on
the
whole
affair
as
a
practical
joke
played
upon
them
by
fate
of
which
they
could
clearly
perceive
the
humorous
side
he
therefore
turned
the
conversation
by
recounting
all
he
knew
even
to
the
minutest
circumstance
of
her
husband
adventures
and
she
in
her
turn
poured
into
his
ear
her
tale
of
woe
in
winchester
i
ca
understand
he
said
at
the
conclusion
of
her
narrative
why
allingford
did
not
receive
the
telegram
you
sent
to
basingstoke
yesterday
as
i
think
i
told
you
she
replied
that
strange
person
faro
charlie
offered
to
send
it
for
me
and
as
i
had
no
change
i
gave
him
a
note
oh
said
carrington
perhaps
that
solves
the
mystery
did
your
friend
bring
you
back
the
change
n
o
admitted
allingford
that
is
not
yet
i
afraid
you
will
never
hear
from
your
note
and
that
allingford
never
received
his
telegram
from
winchester
commented
carrington
but
it
has
disposed
of
faro
charlie
as
a
witness
and
perhaps
that
was
worth
the
money
do
you
really
think
he
meant
to
take
it
she
asked
in
a
shocked
tone
i
sure
of
it
he
replied
and
time
will
prove
the
correctness
of
my
theory
and
time
did
they
breakfasted
together
and
at
carrington
suggestion
all
the
baggage
was
sent
to
the
station
in
order
that
they
might
have
every
chance
of
making
the
train
jack
brother
joined
them
about
eight
and
the
three
proceeded
to
the
court
where
a
few
words
from
that
officer
to
the
magistrate
with
whom
he
was
personally
acquainted
were
sufficient
to
bring
scarsdale
case
first
on
the
docket
the
landlord
of
the
lion
head
appeared
a
mass
of
bandages
and
groaning
dolefully
to
excite
the
sympathy
of
the
court
but
he
testified
without
hesitation
that
the
prisoner
though
somewhat
resembling
richard
allingford
was
not
he
and
it
did
not
need
carrington
identification
to
make
scarsdale
a
free
man
then
there
were
mutual
congratulations
and
a
hurried
drive
to
the
station
where
they
just
succeeded
in
catching
the
train
and
almost
before
he
knew
it
jack
was
standing
alone
upon
the
platform
while
his
two
friends
were
speeding
towards
the
goal
of
all
their
hopes
southampton
and
salisbury
i
suppose
said
scarsdale
to
the
consul
as
their
train
drew
out
of
salisbury
in
the
first
flush
of
the
sunrise
on
the
morning
which
saw
scarsdale
liberation
from
durance
vile
i
suppose
you
realise
that
you
have
exiled
me
from
the
home
of
my
ancestors
how
so
asked
the
consul
why
you
do
imagine
that
i
shall
ever
dare
to
show
my
face
at
melton
court
again
just
picture
to
yourself
her
ladyship
and
your
elephant
she
will
never
forgive
us
and
will
cut
poor
harold
off
with
a
shilling
that
wo
hurt
him
much
from
all
i
heard
of
her
finances
he
replied
i
think
she
resumed
that
i
ought
to
be
very
angry
with
you
but
i
ca
help
laughing
it
is
so
absurd
a
bull
in
a
would
be
tame
compared
with
an
elephant
at
melton
court
what
do
you
think
she
will
do
with
the
beast
pasture
it
on
the
front
lawn
to
keep
away
objectionable
relatives
retorted
the
consul
but
seriously
speaking
have
you
any
definite
plan
of
campaign
certainly
not
what
do
you
suppose
i
carry
you
round
for
if
it
is
not
to
plan
campaigns
which
you
generally
alter
you
will
please
remember
that
the
visit
to
melton
court
was
entirely
owing
to
you
quite
and
i
shall
probably
upset
this
one
but
proceed
well
in
the
first
place
as
soon
as
we
reach
southampton
i
think
we
had
better
have
a
good
breakfast
that
is
no
news
you
are
a
man
therefore
you
eat
go
on
do
you
object
not
at
all
i
expected
it
i
even
eat
with
you
well
said
after
this
necessary
duty
i
propose
to
go
to
the
station
and
thoroughly
investigate
the
matter
of
the
arrival
and
departure
of
my
wife
and
your
husband
if
they
were
at
basingstoke
we
should
have
heard
from
them
before
this
she
said
and
even
if
they
were
not
they
should
have
telegraphed
very
probably
they
did
he
replied
but
as
you
ought
to
know
there
is
nothing
more
obliging
and
more
generally
dense
than
an
english
minor
official
i
dare
say
that
the
key
to
the
whole
mystery
is
at
this
moment
reposing
neatly
done
up
in
red
tape
at
the
office
of
that
disgusting
little
junction
but
here
we
are
at
southampton
now
for
breakfast
and
then
the
american
sherlock
holmes
will
sift
this
matter
to
the
bottom
and
the
consul
in
excellent
spirits
assisted
her
to
alight
indeed
now
that
the
elephant
had
been
left
behind
he
felt
that
actually
as
well
as
metaphorically
a
great
weight
had
been
lifted
from
his
shoulders
evidently
remarked
allingford
as
they
were
finishing
a
breakfast
in
one
of
the
cosy
principal
hotels
evidently
the
loss
of
your
husband
has
not
included
the
loss
of
your
appetite
of
course
it
has
replied
scarsdale
why
should
i
eat
a
good
breakfast
i
have
no
use
for
conventions
which
make
one
do
disagreeable
things
just
because
one
happens
to
feel
miserable
do
you
feel
very
miserable
i
thought
you
seemed
rather
cheerful
on
the
whole
he
commented
well
you
are
not
to
think
anything
so
unpleasant
or
personal
utterly
wretched
and
if
you
do
believe
it
i
wo
eat
a
mouthful
i
sure
he
returned
that
your
husband
would
be
much
put
out
if
he
knew
you
contemplated
doing
anything
so
foolish
do
you
know
she
said
that
i
beginning
to
have
serious
doubts
that
i
ever
had
a
husband
do
you
think
he
a
myth
and
that
you
and
i
will
have
to
go
through
life
together
in
an
endless
pursuit
of
what
exist
good
lord
i
hope
not
he
exclaimed
that
is
very
uncomplimentary
to
me
she
retorted
in
the
face
of
that
remark
he
replied
pushing
back
his
chair
i
am
silent
do
you
know
said
his
companion
after
a
moment
as
she
folded
her
napkin
that
the
keen
sense
of
humour
with
which
we
americans
are
endowed
saves
a
large
percentage
of
us
from
going
mad
or
committing
suicide
are
you
thinking
of
doing
either
he
asked
anxiously
i
am
thinking
she
replied
that
we
have
had
two
exceedingly
amusing
days
and
i
am
almost
sorry
they
are
over
do
you
want
to
find
your
husband
he
exclaimed
of
course
i
do
but
it
has
been
a
sort
of
before
settling
down
to
the
seriousness
of
married
life
and
that
elephant
episode
was
funny
i
think
it
was
worth
two
days
of
any
husband
you
i
do
know
returned
the
consul
somewhat
ruefully
i
just
as
lief
that
scarsdale
had
had
the
beast
oh
i
would
she
cried
he
would
have
spoiled
all
the
fun
have
done
some
stupid
rational
thing
donated
it
to
the
in
london
i
should
think
wasted
the
elephant
in
fact
it
took
the
spirit
of
american
humour
to
play
your
colossal
practical
joke
i
wonder
if
it
has
arrived
at
the
court
yet
i
can
fancy
it
sticking
its
head
trunk
and
all
through
the
great
window
in
lady
melton
she
called
me
a
consular
person
remarked
that
official
stiffly
hence
the
elephant
laughed
his
fair
companion
cause
and
effect
but
joking
apart
there
is
a
pitiful
side
to
our
adventure
when
i
think
of
those
two
serious
british
things
your
better
half
and
my
my
husband
and
of
what
a
miserable
time
they
have
been
having
unrelieved
by
any
spark
of
humour
it
almost
makes
me
cry
hold
on
cried
allingford
you
are
just
as
bad
as
your
she
calls
me
a
consular
person
and
you
call
my
wife
a
british
thing
i
wish
i
had
another
elephant
i
beg
your
pardon
i
do
really
she
replied
i
classed
my
husband
in
the
same
category
but
do
you
agree
with
me
that
it
sad
i
sure
your
poor
wife
has
cried
her
eyes
out
and
as
for
my
husband
i
doubt
if
he
eaten
anything
and
i
certain
he
worn
his
most
unbecoming
clothes
you
are
wrong
there
interrupted
allingford
he
packed
all
the
worst
specimens
and
i
rescued
them
at
salisbury
i
tried
them
on
yesterday
and
there
was
a
suit
i
have
had
the
face
to
wear
in
public
there
run
along
and
turn
the
station
upside
down
you
talked
enough
she
said
laughing
and
drove
him
playfully
out
of
the
room
it
was
about
nine
that
the
consul
meditatively
mopped
his
head
as
he
reached
the
top
step
of
the
hotel
porch
he
was
heated
by
his
exertions
but
exceedingly
complacent
he
had
interviewed
sixteen
porters
five
guards
the
station
agent
three
four
policemen
and
the
barmaid
the
latter
twice
once
on
business
and
once
on
pleasure
and
he
had
discovered
from
the
thirtieth
individual
and
after
failures
and
a
drink
the
simple
fact
that
those
he
sought
had
gone
to
winchester
he
did
not
think
he
could
have
faced
scarsdale
if
he
had
failed
as
it
was
he
returned
triumphant
and
as
he
approached
their
private
parlour
he
mentally
pictured
in
advance
the
scene
which
would
await
him
her
radiant
smile
her
voluble
expression
of
thanks
their
joyful
journey
to
winchester
in
short
success
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
this
is
what
really
happened
an
angry
woman
with
a
flushed
face
rushed
across
the
room
shoved
a
newspaper
at
him
and
cried
you
brute
the
consul
dropped
into
the
nearest
chair
he
looked
at
the
infuriated
scarsdale
he
looked
at
the
crumpled
newspaper
he
heard
the
last
echo
of
that
opprobrious
monosyllable
and
he
said
well
i
jiggered
then
recollecting
his
news
he
continued
oh
i
forgot
i
found
out
where
they
have
gone
it
winchester
is
that
all
you
got
to
tell
me
she
cried
all
in
the
face
of
this
and
she
again
shoved
the
newspaper
towards
him
he
looked
to
where
her
finger
pointed
he
was
hopelessly
bewildered
and
wondered
if
her
native
humour
had
inopportunely
failed
her
and
she
had
gone
mad
read
she
commanded
his
wandering
eye
followed
the
direction
of
her
finger
and
he
read
slowly
with
open
mouth
a
short
account
of
the
arrest
and
partial
trial
at
winchester
of
one
richard
allingford
who
claimed
to
be
harold
scarsdale
tell
me
she
thundered
is
that
my
husband
well
he
said
slowly
i
guess
it
is
and
he
the
last
sentence
of
the
paragraph
in
the
newspaper
prisoner
insisted
that
he
was
harold
scarsdale
and
could
prove
his
identity
he
was
accompanied
by
a
woman
who
claimed
to
be
robert
allingford
wife
of
the
united
states
consul
at
christchurch
the
prisoner
was
remanded
till
this
have
you
a
brother
yes
has
he
ever
been
arrested
arrested
why
i
spent
most
of
my
time
for
the
past
twenty
years
in
bailing
him
out
but
why
has
my
husband
taken
his
name
she
demanded
that
is
a
matter
you
have
to
settle
with
scarsdale
and
if
you
look
as
you
do
now
i
real
sorry
for
him
he
replied
you
do
care
a
bit
she
cried
oh
yes
i
do
but
i
want
you
to
see
it
from
its
humorous
side
he
answered
at
this
remark
scarsdale
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
and
allingford
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
and
strolling
to
the
window
was
soon
lost
in
admiration
of
the
view
suddenly
a
voice
said
in
the
sweetness
of
its
accustomed
tones
why
were
you
so
pleased
when
i
began
to
cry
and
scarsdale
calm
and
composed
stood
beside
him
hard
storm
is
a
good
thing
to
clear
the
atmosphere
after
a
replied
the
consul
laconically
i
was
real
mad
with
you
she
admitted
great
scott
do
you
suppose
i
knew
that
he
cried
they
both
laughed
and
peace
was
restored
do
you
really
think
it
is
poor
harold
i
suppose
he
does
get
called
hubart
when
he
in
be
sensible
and
answer
my
question
is
it
my
husband
or
your
brother
who
is
on
trial
at
winchester
i
do
know
he
replied
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
she
asked
go
and
see
when
is
the
next
train
the
consul
pulled
out
his
watch
in
twelve
and
a
half
minutes
he
said
i
paid
the
hotel
bill
here
hold
on
you
turn
to
the
left
for
the
elevator
but
scarsdale
was
downstairs
on
her
way
to
the
station
an
hour
later
as
the
consul
and
his
fair
companion
emerged
at
the
station
at
winchester
the
first
person
they
saw
was
carrington
we
been
found
at
last
cried
the
consul
advancing
towards
jack
with
outstretched
hand
exclaiming
well
columbus
carrington
if
ever
i
get
lost
again
i
telegraph
you
first
thing
in
a
minute
questions
and
answers
were
flying
between
them
where
had
they
been
where
had
they
come
from
why
was
carrington
here
why
had
scarsdale
been
arrested
jack
bore
up
manfully
answering
as
best
he
could
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
the
whereabouts
of
my
wife
and
this
husband
said
the
consul
they
have
been
staying
here
he
replied
but
they
have
gone
gone
cried
allingford
in
blank
amazement
gone
where
when
why
to
salisbury
replied
jack
i
sent
them
over
there
early
this
morning
you
did
did
you
spluttered
the
consul
what
right
had
you
to
send
them
anywhere
why
to
join
you
at
lady
diana
join
us
screamed
allingford
why
we
left
melton
court
at
four
this
morning
and
have
been
on
the
road
ever
since
trying
to
join
them
it
seems
to
be
a
typical
example
of
replied
carrington
it
pure
cussedness
said
the
consul
but
i
thought
my
husband
was
in
prison
chimed
in
scarsdale
the
paper
said
so
merely
a
case
of
mistaken
identity
jack
hastened
to
assure
her
i
had
him
set
free
in
no
time
and
that
reminds
me
i
ran
across
your
brother
here
last
evening
allingford
it
is
he
who
has
caused
all
the
trouble
frankly
i
am
almost
sorry
i
did
not
give
him
over
to
the
police
i
wish
you
had
replied
the
consul
i
would
have
bailed
him
out
till
my
honeymoon
was
over
where
is
he
now
i
inclined
to
believe
replied
carrington
that
he
has
gone
to
melton
court
in
search
of
you
in
company
with
a
man
who
talked
some
nonsense
about
your
having
stolen
an
elephant
from
him
allingford
and
scarsdale
both
began
to
laugh
i
do
see
anything
funny
about
that
said
jack
oh
do
you
returned
the
consul
well
you
would
if
you
knew
the
rest
of
the
story
and
in
a
few
brief
words
he
explained
about
the
elephant
arrival
and
their
subsequent
flight
heavens
man
cried
carrington
you
do
seem
to
realise
what
you
have
let
scarsdale
and
your
wife
in
for
great
scott
exclaimed
the
consul
i
never
thought
of
that
why
i
reckon
it
rampaging
all
over
the
place
by
this
time
and
the
old
lady
must
be
in
a
perfect
fury
when
the
next
train
back
we
ca
get
there
too
quickly
one
goes
in
five
minutes
said
jack
if
i
ever
suspected
gasped
scarsdale
to
allingford
as
they
rushed
down
the
platform
that
you
were
laying
such
a
trap
for
my
poor
husband
i
sure
i
did
do
it
on
purpose
he
replied
but
if
they
happen
to
meet
the
catawampus
after
she
met
the
elephant
they
be
in
for
a
pretty
hot
time
your
brother
was
bad
enough
she
groaned
as
the
train
pulled
out
but
as
for
your
elephant
it
worse
than
being
arrested
chapter
x
in
which
lady
melton
receives
a
strange
visitor
however
harassing
and
disturbing
the
events
of
the
past
few
days
had
been
to
the
people
particularly
interested
in
them
to
the
mind
of
one
the
proceedings
of
all
those
with
whom
he
had
come
in
contact
had
been
characterised
by
an
ignorance
not
only
of
the
necessities
of
life
but
even
of
the
very
etiquette
that
lends
a
becoming
dignity
to
existence
which
seemed
almost
pitiful
not
since
the
elephant
left
his
native
shore
had
he
received
what
he
considered
to
be
proper
or
even
intelligent
attention
on
the
voyage
indeed
though
his
quarters
were
crowded
and
denied
by
the
proximity
of
beasts
his
material
wants
had
been
considered
but
since
yesterday
when
he
had
landed
in
the
midst
of
a
howling
wilderness
of
iron
monsters
who
could
neither
see
nor
hear
and
were
no
respecters
of
persons
there
had
been
a
scarcity
even
of
food
and
water
all
night
he
had
been
dragged
about
the
country
at
a
speed
unbecoming
the
dignity
of
a
ruler
of
the
jungle
without
even
the
company
of
his
mahout
who
had
lost
the
train
at
southampton
and
now
that
the
earth
had
ceased
to
move
past
him
and
was
once
more
still
he
expressed
his
opinion
of
the
ignorant
and
degraded
people
of
this
wretched
country
in
no
uncertain
voice
then
finding
that
the
pen
in
which
he
was
confined
was
cramped
and
dirty
and
wholly
unfitted
for
one
of
his
exalted
position
he
exerted
himself
to
be
free
and
in
a
short
time
reduced
his
car
to
being
now
at
liberty
he
naturally
desired
his
breakfast
but
what
was
one
to
do
when
men
disfigured
the
earth
with
bars
of
steel
over
which
one
tripped
and
stored
the
fruits
of
the
land
in
squat
yellow
bungalows
with
fluted
iron
roofs
which
were
difficult
to
tear
off
therefore
the
elephant
lifted
up
his
voice
in
rage
whereat
many
things
happened
and
a
man
clad
in
the
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
gold
of
the
sun
ran
up
and
down
upon
the
earth
and
declared
that
he
should
forthwith
be
taken
to
the
court
and
delivered
to
the
damconsul
what
a
damconsul
was
the
elephant
did
not
know
but
concluded
that
it
was
the
title
these
barbarous
people
bestowed
on
the
maharajah
of
that
district
since
he
lived
at
a
court
it
seemed
certain
that
he
would
know
how
to
appreciate
and
fittingly
entertain
him
the
elephant
therefore
consented
to
follow
his
attendant
slaves
though
they
understood
not
the
noble
art
of
riding
him
but
were
fain
to
lead
him
like
a
beast
of
burden
on
the
way
he
found
a
spring
of
sweet
water
of
which
he
drank
his
fill
despite
the
protestations
of
his
leaders
and
the
outcries
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
bungalow
of
the
well
whose
lamentations
showed
them
to
be
of
low
caste
and
little
sensible
of
the
honour
done
them
the
procession
at
length
reached
the
gate
of
the
court
and
while
the
attendants
were
in
the
lodge
explaining
matters
to
the
astonished
keeper
the
elephant
realising
that
drink
was
good
but
food
better
determined
to
do
a
little
foraging
on
his
own
account
and
so
moved
softly
off
taking
along
the
stake
to
which
his
keepers
fondly
imagined
he
was
tethered
he
judged
that
he
was
now
in
the
park
of
the
court
of
the
damconsul
and
the
fact
that
there
were
many
clumps
of
familiar
plants
scattered
over
the
grass
increased
his
belief
that
this
was
the
case
he
tried
a
few
coleus
and
ate
a
croton
or
two
but
found
them
insipid
and
lacking
the
freshness
of
those
which
bloomed
in
his
native
land
then
turning
to
a
grove
of
young
palms
he
tore
a
number
up
by
the
roots
which
he
found
required
no
expenditure
of
strength
and
so
gave
him
little
satisfaction
moreover
they
grew
in
green
tubs
which
rolled
about
between
his
feet
and
were
pitfalls
for
the
unwary
he
lay
down
on
a
few
of
the
beds
but
the
foliage
was
pitifully
thin
and
afforded
him
no
comfortable
moreover
there
were
curious
rows
of
slanting
things
which
glistened
in
the
sunlight
and
which
he
much
wished
to
investigate
on
examination
he
found
them
quite
brittle
and
easily
smashed
a
number
of
them
with
his
trunk
nor
was
this
all
for
in
the
wreckage
he
discovered
a
large
quantity
of
most
excellent
fruit
grapes
and
nectarines
and
some
very
passable
plums
evidently
the
damconsul
was
an
enlightened
person
who
knew
how
to
live
and
indeed
it
is
not
fitting
for
even
an
elephant
to
turn
up
his
trunk
at
espalier
peaches
at
a
guinea
apiece
certainly
thought
the
elephant
things
might
be
worse
and
after
a
bath
in
a
neighbouring
fountain
which
cost
the
lives
of
some
two
score
of
goldfish
he
really
felt
refreshed
and
approached
the
palace
which
he
considered
rather
dingy
in
order
to
pay
his
respects
to
its
owner
coming
round
to
the
front
of
the
building
he
discovered
a
marble
terrace
gleaming
white
in
the
sunshine
and
flanked
by
two
groups
of
statuary
hercules
with
his
club
and
diana
with
her
bow
though
being
unacquainted
with
greek
mythology
he
did
not
recognise
them
as
such
on
the
terrace
itself
was
set
a
resplendent
with
silver
and
chaste
with
fair
linen
and
by
it
sat
a
houri
holding
a
sunshade
over
her
golden
head
the
elephant
wishing
to
conciliate
this
vision
of
beauty
advanced
towards
her
trumpeting
gently
but
his
friendly
overtures
were
evidently
misinterpreted
for
the
houri
giving
a
wild
scream
dropped
her
sunshade
and
fled
for
safety
to
the
shoulders
of
hercules
from
which
she
called
loudly
for
help
feeling
that
such
conduct
was
indecorous
in
the
extreme
he
ignored
her
with
a
lofty
contempt
and
having
tested
the
quality
of
the
masonry
ventured
upon
the
terrace
and
inspected
the
feast
there
were
more
nectarines
but
he
had
had
enough
of
those
and
something
steaming
in
a
silver
vessel
the
like
of
which
he
remembered
to
have
encountered
once
before
in
the
bungalow
of
a
sahib
moreover
he
had
not
forgotten
how
it
spouted
a
boiling
liquid
when
one
took
it
up
in
one
trunk
at
this
moment
a
shameless
female
slave
appeared
at
a
window
in
response
to
the
cries
of
the
houri
and
abused
him
he
could
not
it
is
true
understand
her
barbarous
language
but
the
tone
implied
abuse
such
an
insult
from
the
scum
of
the
earth
could
not
be
allowed
to
pass
unnoticed
he
filled
his
trunk
with
water
from
a
marble
basin
near
at
hand
and
squirted
it
at
her
with
all
his
force
and
the
scum
of
the
earth
departed
quickly
it
would
be
well
thought
the
elephant
to
find
the
before
further
untoward
incidents
could
occur
and
with
this
end
in
view
he
turned
himself
about
preparatory
to
leaving
the
terrace
he
forgot
however
that
marble
may
be
slippery
his
hind
legs
suddenly
slid
from
under
him
and
he
sat
hurriedly
down
on
the
it
was
at
this
singularly
inopportune
moment
that
lady
diana
appeared
upon
the
scene
her
ladyship
awoke
that
morning
to
what
was
destined
to
be
the
most
eventful
and
disturbing
day
of
her
peaceful
and
life
with
a
feeling
of
irritation
and
regret
that
it
had
dawned
which
in
the
light
of
subsequent
events
would
seem
to
have
been
almost
a
premonition
of
coming
evil
she
was
though
at
this
early
hour
she
little
knew
it
destined
to
receive
a
series
of
shocks
of
volcanic
force
and
suddenness
between
sunrise
and
sunset
any
one
of
which
would
have
served
to
overthrow
her
preconceived
notions
of
what
life
and
especially
life
at
melton
court
ought
to
be
as
yet
she
knew
nothing
of
all
this
but
she
did
know
that
though
it
was
long
after
the
hour
appointed
she
had
heard
no
sound
of
her
departing
footsteps
she
waited
till
she
must
have
missed
the
train
and
then
rang
her
bedroom
bell
sharply
to
learn
why
her
orders
had
been
disobeyed
if
you
please
my
lady
replied
her
maid
in
answer
to
her
questions
bright
did
not
go
because
we
could
not
find
mrs
scarsdale
could
not
find
my
niece
and
why
not
pray
demanded
her
ladyship
angrily
she
was
not
in
her
room
my
lady
or
anywhere
about
the
court
only
this
note
directed
to
your
ladyship
on
her
why
did
you
say
so
to
begin
with
then
cried
her
mistress
testily
open
the
window
that
i
may
see
what
this
means
the
note
was
short
and
painstakingly
polite
but
its
perusal
did
not
seem
to
please
lady
diana
for
she
frowned
and
set
her
thin
lips
as
she
it
the
missive
ran
as
follows
dear
lady
melton
i
write
to
apologise
for
the
somewhat
unconventional
manner
in
which
i
am
leaving
your
house
but
as
your
plans
for
my
disposal
did
not
accord
with
my
own
ideas
of
what
is
fitting
i
have
thought
it
best
to
leave
thus
early
and
so
avoid
any
awkwardness
which
might
arise
from
conflicting
arrangements
i
wish
you
to
know
that
i
shall
be
with
friends
by
this
evening
so
that
you
need
feel
no
anxiety
about
my
position
pray
accept
my
thanks
for
your
hospitality
which
i
am
sure
my
husband
will
much
appreciate
and
believe
me
yours
respectfully
mabel
scarsdale
this
communication
her
ladyship
tore
up
into
small
fragments
and
then
snapped
out
is
there
anything
more
yes
if
you
please
my
lady
replied
the
maid
a
note
for
you
from
allingford
left
in
his
room
lady
melton
took
it
as
gingerly
as
if
it
were
fresh
from
some
infected
district
and
spreading
it
out
on
the
bed
before
her
read
it
with
a
contemptuous
smile
your
ladyship
wrote
the
consul
i
have
the
honour
to
inform
you
that
i
am
leaving
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
not
wishing
to
impose
my
company
longer
than
is
absolutely
necessary
where
it
is
so
evidently
undesired
that
there
may
be
no
burden
of
obligation
between
us
i
beg
you
to
accept
a
trunk
belonging
to
me
which
will
arrive
this
morning
as
compensation
for
my
board
and
lodging
i
remain
your
ladyship
obedient
servant
robert
allingford
consul
christchurch
i
mail
you
a
deed
of
gift
of
the
property
in
question
legally
attested
so
that
there
may
be
no
question
of
ownership
r
a
insolence
gasped
lady
melton
when
she
comprehended
the
contents
of
this
astonishing
communication
then
turning
to
her
maid
she
commanded
if
this
person
trunk
arrives
here
have
it
sent
back
to
him
instantly
and
she
fumed
with
rage
at
the
thought
how
dare
he
suppose
that
i
would
for
a
moment
accept
a
gratuity
indeed
so
wrought
up
was
she
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
she
controlled
herself
sufficiently
to
breakfast
on
the
terrace
moreover
her
interview
with
bright
the
butler
whom
she
encountered
on
her
way
downstairs
and
who
announced
the
arrival
of
her
and
a
strange
lady
was
hardly
soothing
for
it
forced
her
to
believe
that
that
faithful
servant
after
years
of
probity
had
at
last
strayed
from
the
temperate
paths
of
virtue
seeing
him
dishevelled
and
bewildered
she
had
sternly
rebuked
him
for
his
appearance
and
from
his
disjointed
replies
had
only
gathered
that
his
astounding
state
was
in
some
way
due
to
the
consul
has
that
insolent
person
trunk
arrived
she
inquired
when
to
her
astonishment
her
old
retainer
who
had
always
observed
in
her
presence
a
respectful
and
highly
deferential
demeanour
actually
tittered
bright
she
said
sternly
beg
pardon
my
lady
giggled
bright
his
face
still
wreathed
in
smiles
but
the
way
you
put
it
what
have
you
done
with
this
person
belongings
have
my
orders
been
carried
out
you
mean
in
regard
to
the
the
trunk
yes
let
it
be
put
off
the
place
immediately
please
your
ladyship
he
replied
with
difficulty
restraining
his
laughter
it
wo
go
will
not
go
no
my
lady
it
been
rampaging
through
the
greenhouses
and
is
now
on
the
terrace
where
it
douched
anne
most
awful
leave
me
at
once
bright
and
do
not
let
me
see
you
again
till
you
are
in
a
more
decent
state
she
commanded
and
swept
by
him
ignoring
his
protestations
of
innocence
and
respect
she
found
scarsdale
awaiting
her
in
the
and
accorded
him
a
very
frigid
greeting
suggesting
that
they
should
have
their
interview
on
the
terrace
where
he
had
left
allingford
safely
ensconced
in
an
armchair
while
he
went
to
meet
his
her
ladyship
had
been
considerably
ruffled
both
by
her
interview
with
bright
and
by
the
arrival
of
scarsdale
towards
whom
in
the
light
of
recent
events
she
felt
a
strong
resentment
and
a
vision
of
the
consul
wife
perched
most
indecorously
on
the
shoulders
of
hercules
which
she
beheld
as
she
emerged
on
the
terrace
did
not
tend
to
calm
her
already
excited
nerves
but
before
she
could
speak
her
eyes
followed
the
direction
of
the
unknown
lady
gaze
and
she
saw
for
the
first
time
her
unwelcome
visitor
when
you
come
suddenly
face
to
face
with
an
elephant
seated
amidst
the
wreck
of
cherished
chippendale
and
ancestral
sèvres
it
is
not
calculated
to
increase
your
composure
or
equalise
your
temper
and
lady
diana
may
be
pardoned
as
the
vastness
of
the
consul
impudence
dawned
upon
her
for
giving
vent
to
expressions
both
of
anger
and
amazement
albeit
her
appearance
produced
no
less
of
a
disturbance
in
the
breast
of
him
who
sat
amidst
the
ruins
of
the
the
elephant
felt
that
in
the
presence
of
the
maharanee
for
such
he
believed
her
to
be
his
position
was
undignified
she
was
without
doubt
the
wife
of
the
damconsul
and
as
such
should
be
paid
all
proper
respect
and
deference
he
therefore
bowed
his
head
in
submission
completing
in
the
process
his
work
of
destruction
whereat
allingford
shrieked
and
clung
more
closely
to
the
protecting
shoulders
of
hercules
serious
as
the
situation
was
it
was
not
without
its
humorous
side
and
it
took
all
scarsdale
command
of
himself
to
control
his
face
sufficiently
to
address
his
relative
with
becoming
respect
why
aunt
he
said
i
did
know
that
you
had
gone
in
for
pets
harold
stanley
malcolm
hubart
scarsdale
replied
her
ladyship
she
prided
herself
on
never
forgetting
a
name
you
are
one
of
the
most
impudent
and
worthless
young
men
that
i
have
the
honour
to
count
among
my
relatives
but
you
have
been
in
india
and
you
ought
to
know
how
to
manage
this
monster
i
seen
enough
of
them
he
answered
what
do
you
want
him
to
do
do
she
cried
wrathfully
i
should
think
anybody
would
know
that
i
wished
it
to
get
up
and
go
away
oh
said
he
and
made
a
remark
in
hindustani
to
the
elephant
whereat
the
beast
gradually
and
deliberately
proceeded
to
rise
from
the
wreck
of
the
breakfast
till
he
seemed
to
the
spectators
to
be
forty
feet
high
then
in
response
to
scarsdale
cries
of
mail
mail
go
on
he
turned
himself
about
and
after
sending
the
teapot
through
the
nearest
window
with
a
disdainful
kick
of
one
hind
leg
he
lurched
down
the
steps
of
the
terrace
and
on
to
the
lawn
where
he
remained
contentedly
standing
gently
rocking
to
and
fro
while
he
meditatively
removed
from
his
person
by
means
of
his
trunk
the
fragments
of
the
feast
with
which
he
was
liberally
bespattered
scarsdale
seeing
that
his
lordship
was
in
an
amicable
frame
of
mind
hastened
to
assist
allingford
to
descend
from
her
somewhat
uneasy
perch
hubart
said
lady
melton
who
throughout
this
trying
ordeal
had
lost
none
of
her
natural
dignity
you
have
done
me
a
service
i
shall
not
forget
it
scarsdale
thought
it
would
be
difficult
to
forget
the
elephant
i
will
even
forgive
you
she
continued
for
marrying
that
american
it
was
so
good
of
you
to
receive
my
wife
he
said
i
trust
you
are
pleased
with
her
i
am
not
pleased
at
all
she
said
sharply
i
consider
her
forward
and
disrespectful
and
i
am
glad
she
is
gone
gone
he
exclaimed
you
may
well
be
surprised
said
his
but
such
is
the
case
but
where
has
she
gone
that
i
do
not
know
she
left
without
consulting
me
and
against
my
advice
and
wishes
did
she
go
alone
she
went
replied
her
ladyship
with
one
of
the
most
insolent
persons
it
has
ever
been
my
misfortune
to
meet
he
is
owner
of
that
and
she
pointed
to
the
elephant
but
who
is
he
demanded
scarsdale
not
recognising
from
her
description
his
friend
the
consul
he
disgraces
she
continued
a
public
office
given
him
by
a
foreign
government
you
are
surely
not
talking
about
allingford
he
exclaimed
that
i
believe
is
his
name
replied
lady
melton
what
my
husband
cried
the
consul
wife
who
up
to
this
point
had
kept
silence
you
dare
to
call
my
husband
a
disgrace
here
allingford
became
dumb
with
indignation
if
he
is
your
husband
returned
her
ladyship
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
for
you
as
for
to
apply
to
him
any
epithet
i
please
i
consider
myself
fully
justified
in
so
doing
after
the
indignity
to
which
he
has
condemned
me
i
am
glad
however
to
have
met
you
as
i
am
thus
enabled
to
return
you
your
husband
property
with
the
request
that
you
take
your
elephant
and
leave
my
grounds
as
quickly
as
possible
do
you
mean
to
say
that
my
husband
owns
that
monster
gasped
allingford
such
is
the
case
replied
lady
melton
and
i
leave
it
in
your
hands
hubart
i
trust
will
join
me
at
breakfast
as
soon
as
another
can
be
prepared
excuse
me
he
said
apologetically
but
really
you
know
i
leave
allingford
in
the
lurch
besides
i
must
follow
my
wife
his
faced
round
in
a
fury
that
is
sufficient
she
cried
leave
my
presence
at
once
i
never
desire
to
see
either
of
you
again
do
let
us
part
as
enemies
aunt
he
said
offering
her
his
hand
but
she
swept
past
him
into
the
house
scarsdale
gloomily
watched
her
depart
and
then
became
conscious
of
a
hand
laid
on
his
arm
i
am
so
sorry
murmured
allingford
i
only
seem
to
bring
you
trouble
oh
you
must
feel
badly
about
this
he
said
we
have
quarrelled
ever
since
i
was
born
i
much
more
worried
about
you
what
am
i
going
to
do
with
it
she
exclaimed
looking
hopelessly
at
her
husband
property
as
it
stood
rocking
before
her
the
first
thing
is
to
get
it
off
the
place
replied
scarsdale
assuming
a
cheerfulness
which
he
did
not
feel
we
may
find
its
keepers
at
the
lodge
and
we
can
make
our
plans
as
we
walk
along
come
on
jehoshaphat
or
whatever
you
may
happen
to
be
called
he
cried
addressing
the
elephant
and
at
the
same
time
grasping
the
rope
bridle
which
still
dangled
from
its
neck
and
the
beast
recognising
a
kindred
spirit
speaking
to
him
in
his
native
tongue
followed
docilely
where
he
led
i
think
continued
scarsdale
as
they
trudged
slowly
across
the
park
that
our
best
course
will
be
to
take
the
elephant
to
christchurch
indeed
we
ought
to
have
gone
there
in
the
first
instance
what
do
you
expect
to
gain
by
that
she
asked
quickly
ready
in
this
strange
dilemma
to
catch
at
any
straw
which
gave
opportunity
of
escape
why
your
husband
consulate
is
situated
there
and
that
is
his
local
habitation
in
this
country
where
he
is
certain
to
turn
up
sooner
or
later
and
where
if
the
laws
of
his
consular
service
are
anything
like
ours
he
would
be
obliged
to
report
every
few
days
you
propose
to
go
there
and
await
his
return
yes
he
said
i
do
see
that
we
can
do
better
ten
to
one
your
husband
and
my
wife
will
hear
of
our
affair
at
winchester
and
may
be
on
their
way
there
now
to
hunt
us
up
while
if
we
attempted
to
follow
them
it
is
more
than
likely
that
they
would
return
here
i
for
one
am
about
tired
of
chasing
myself
around
the
country
as
a
steady
occupation
it
is
beginning
to
pall
there
is
a
group
of
men
at
the
lodge
she
said
as
they
drew
near
the
gates
with
the
elephant
in
tow
then
let
us
hope
that
there
are
some
station
people
among
them
and
that
we
can
arrange
for
jehoshaphat
transportation
without
loss
of
time
replied
scarsdale
his
hope
was
in
the
first
instance
justified
for
the
at
salisbury
learning
of
the
consul
early
departure
that
morning
and
beginning
to
doubt
the
wisdom
of
inflicting
the
elephant
on
so
important
a
personage
as
lady
melton
had
come
up
to
the
court
himself
to
see
how
things
were
going
and
had
been
horrified
beyond
measure
at
the
exaggerated
reports
of
the
lodgekeeper
as
to
the
havoc
the
beast
had
created
he
was
therefore
unfeignedly
relieved
at
scarsdale
arrival
a
relief
however
which
instantly
gave
way
to
stubborn
opposition
at
the
first
hint
of
putting
the
animal
again
in
his
charge
elephants
were
not
in
his
line
he
pointed
out
and
he
had
no
desire
to
transport
them
about
the
country
could
think
of
acting
without
receiving
advices
from
the
main
offices
of
the
railway
company
in
london
an
affair
of
several
days
would
assume
charge
of
the
creature
during
the
interval
on
any
account
and
should
stir
a
step
in
the
matter
till
the
wrecked
van
had
been
paid
for
this
ended
the
affair
as
far
as
scarsdale
was
concerned
he
had
no
intention
of
paying
damages
for
the
consul
elephant
but
he
wished
to
deliver
it
and
the
consul
wife
at
christchurch
as
soon
as
possible
if
this
could
not
be
accomplished
one
way
it
must
be
another
there
were
plenty
of
horses
and
carriages
to
be
had
indeed
the
landau
and
pair
which
had
brought
them
from
salisbury
was
still
at
the
gates
the
roads
were
good
the
distance
to
christchurch
was
not
excessive
say
thirty
miles
and
the
elephant
could
walk
it
merely
remained
to
find
a
leader
or
driver
and
they
could
start
at
once
on
their
journey
across
country
all
this
he
explained
to
his
fair
companion
and
she
readily
acquiesced
the
only
problem
to
be
solved
then
is
where
to
find
a
mahout
he
said
in
conclusion
she
threw
him
an
inquiring
glance
but
he
felt
it
was
asking
too
much
and
said
so
if
it
were
any
other
country
i
ride
the
beast
myself
to
oblige
you
but
in
england
and
as
a
representative
of
one
of
the
first
families
of
the
county
i
could
the
prejudices
of
the
locality
would
never
recover
from
the
shock
and
i
should
not
be
able
to
show
my
face
in
the
streets
of
salisbury
but
perhaps
we
can
find
a
substitute
is
there
any
one
here
he
went
on
addressing
the
little
group
of
men
who
understands
an
elephant
tom
knows
the
bloomin
beasts
said
a
member
of
the
company
and
tom
groom
to
her
ladyship
and
cockney
every
inch
of
him
was
pushed
forward
for
inspection
one
glance
at
the
trim
form
concealed
though
it
was
by
stable
costume
was
sufficient
to
assure
scarsdale
that
he
had
found
his
man
you
have
been
a
soldier
he
said
and
in
india
yes
sir
replied
the
man
touching
the
peak
of
his
cap
in
a
military
salute
do
you
think
you
could
manage
him
continued
scarsdale
indicating
the
elephant
which
wearied
with
the
morning
exertions
had
knelt
down
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
taking
a
nap
do
i
think
as
i
could
manage
i
should
so
if
i
fergot
is
language
sir
i
give
you
eighteen
pence
a
mile
said
scarsdale
quick
to
act
on
the
man
decision
make
it
two
bob
sir
an
i
ride
ter
inja
that
too
far
he
replied
laughing
my
pocket
would
stand
the
strain
but
i
give
you
the
price
to
christchurch
right
you
are
replied
the
hostler
closing
the
bargain
at
once
me
name
tom
ropes
what
call
sir
pointing
to
his
recumbent
charge
i
do
know
what
he
was
christened
i
call
him
jehoshaphat
a
christian
name
fer
a
brute
commented
tom
give
me
a
leg
up
one
er
yer
once
astride
the
beast
neck
with
scarsdale
cane
as
an
improvised
ankus
he
poured
out
a
flood
of
jargon
which
no
hindoo
could
ever
have
recognised
as
his
native
tongue
but
which
evidently
had
a
familiar
sound
to
the
elephant
who
proceeded
to
rise
first
with
his
fore
feet
and
then
with
his
hind
feet
after
which
his
novel
mahout
who
throughout
these
manoeuvres
had
retained
a
precarious
hold
by
one
ear
hastened
to
seat
himself
more
firmly
upon
him
all
right
queried
scarsdale
looking
up
and
on
receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
added
keep
your
feet
well
under
his
ears
and
hit
him
on
the
head
with
your
stick
if
he
gets
fractious
all
you
need
do
is
to
follow
our
carriage
trust
to
his
judgment
about
bridges
he
knows
what
will
hold
him
arrangements
on
a
liberal
scale
having
been
made
for
the
use
of
the
conveyance
which
had
brought
them
from
the
station
they
were
ready
to
start
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
scarsdale
stipulating
that
they
head
towards
southampton
taking
the
least
travelled
roads
and
in
any
event
giving
salisbury
a
wide
berth
this
was
agreed
to
and
thereupon
commenced
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
progresses
that
had
ever
stirred
up
a
staid
and
conventional
countryside
scarsdale
and
allingford
leading
off
in
the
landau
since
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
horse
well
in
front
of
the
elephant
and
tom
and
his
charge
plodding
on
in
their
wake
as
they
left
the
lodge
behind
them
and
came
out
into
the
open
country
the
consul
wife
turning
to
her
companion
in
misfortune
said
between
tears
and
smiles
what
do
you
think
is
going
to
happen
next
chapter
xi
in
which
there
are
two
claimants
for
one
dinner
the
village
clock
was
on
the
stroke
of
one
when
the
little
procession
drew
up
before
the
door
of
the
principal
inn
in
the
main
square
of
a
small
town
on
the
road
between
salisbury
and
southampton
scarsdale
had
been
surprised
to
find
how
little
excitement
they
had
created
in
their
progress
through
the
countryside
but
then
he
had
chosen
the
most
unfrequented
roads
avoiding
villages
as
he
would
a
pestilence
man
and
beast
must
be
fed
somewhere
however
and
according
to
tom
the
elephant
was
giving
no
uncertain
signs
that
he
wanted
his
dinner
so
against
his
better
judgment
scarsdale
had
turned
aside
into
a
neighbouring
town
whence
after
an
hour
rest
and
refreshment
he
determined
to
push
on
that
afternoon
to
a
quiet
inn
he
knew
of
near
fording
bridge
and
thence
to
christchurch
the
following
morning
both
he
and
allingford
had
been
as
quiet
as
mice
during
the
last
hour
indeed
the
novel
position
in
which
they
found
themselves
inclined
them
rather
to
thought
than
conversation
their
entrance
into
the
town
was
effected
more
easily
than
could
have
been
hoped
for
though
in
some
unknown
manner
a
rumour
of
their
coming
seemed
to
have
preceded
them
for
a
crowd
had
collected
along
the
main
street
which
cheered
them
vociferously
under
the
mistaken
impression
that
they
were
the
proprietors
of
a
circus
no
travelling
show
that
wound
its
course
through
those
country
lanes
had
ever
possessed
such
an
attraction
and
the
people
moved
away
after
they
had
passed
full
of
wonder
at
the
appearance
of
this
strange
monster
among
them
and
regret
that
with
such
a
beginning
there
was
nothing
more
to
follow
once
they
had
come
to
a
halt
they
were
surrounded
by
a
curious
crowd
and
scarsdale
lost
no
time
in
entering
into
explanations
with
the
landlord
of
the
inn
who
came
hurrying
out
to
receive
his
novel
guests
it
was
at
this
point
that
their
troubles
first
began
for
mine
host
while
he
professed
to
furnish
entertainment
for
man
and
beast
was
dubious
concerning
the
monster
which
it
was
proposed
to
quarter
on
him
so
unexpectedly
the
lady
and
gentleman
their
coachman
horses
and
even
the
cockney
mahout
were
more
than
welcome
but
elephants
were
not
in
his
line
of
business
he
did
know
if
he
could
give
satisfaction
feared
his
accommodations
were
not
sufficiently
ample
would
like
to
oblige
but
had
the
reputation
of
his
house
to
maintain
when
scarsdale
happened
however
casually
to
mention
that
it
was
lady
melton
elephant
a
change
came
over
the
face
of
affairs
of
which
he
was
not
slow
to
take
advantage
her
ladyship
was
well
known
throughout
the
county
while
her
reputation
for
severity
had
a
still
wider
circulation
and
the
landlord
was
in
abject
fear
of
her
though
nevertheless
obstinately
determined
to
have
none
of
the
beast
the
subject
of
all
this
altercation
had
meantime
appropriated
the
public
to
his
exclusive
use
for
drinking
and
bathing
purposes
and
was
enjoying
himself
in
consequence
which
was
more
than
could
be
said
of
his
rider
who
shared
unwillingly
in
his
ablutions
give
the
word
to
sit
down
sir
me
i
be
drownded
with
tricks
cried
tom
i
do
speak
his
infernal
language
returned
scarsdale
testily
that
your
business
i
told
all
i
know
sir
an
it
no
use
then
i
afraid
you
have
to
stay
up
and
get
wet
could
yer
me
down
sir
quit
that
yer
as
he
dodged
a
shower
of
water
certainly
not
replied
scarsdale
you
ca
leave
him
riderless
in
a
public
place
then
turning
to
the
landlord
who
stood
by
in
sore
perplexity
aimlessly
rubbing
his
hands
he
continued
it
a
beastly
shame
that
a
gentleman
ca
take
a
lady
elephant
out
for
exercise
without
running
up
against
all
this
nonsense
in
the
first
little
hamlet
he
comes
across
one
would
almost
think
you
had
never
seen
an
elephant
before
the
landlord
whose
eyes
had
up
to
this
time
been
fairly
bulging
with
curiosity
now
declared
himself
desolated
at
such
an
suspicion
perhaps
it
would
be
better
if
the
gentleman
were
to
send
for
a
constable
mine
host
neglected
to
add
that
he
had
done
so
on
his
own
responsibility
in
his
first
burst
of
agitation
but
scarsdale
noting
the
excellent
effect
which
his
rating
had
produced
on
the
landlord
determined
that
he
should
have
some
more
of
it
if
you
are
afraid
he
said
of
damaging
your
ramshackle
old
inn
perhaps
you
consent
to
give
my
elephant
his
dinner
in
the
square
mine
host
rolled
up
his
eyes
at
this
new
phase
of
the
question
i
suppose
continued
scarsdale
that
the
dignity
of
this
town
wo
be
seriously
impaired
by
his
presence
for
an
hour
in
your
elegant
plaza
the
last
portion
of
this
speech
was
lost
on
the
landlord
because
he
did
not
know
what
a
plaza
was
but
it
sounded
imposing
and
he
hastened
to
assure
his
guest
that
the
town
would
feel
honoured
by
the
presence
though
he
would
have
to
procure
a
permit
from
the
mayor
should
he
show
him
the
way
to
that
functionary
house
this
however
proved
to
be
unnecessary
as
the
mayor
himself
was
present
in
the
crowd
a
pompous
fussy
little
man
full
of
the
importance
of
his
office
lady
melton
name
which
he
had
heard
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
affair
acted
as
a
charm
and
brought
him
bustling
forward
to
shake
scarsdale
hand
assure
him
that
no
permit
was
required
and
snub
the
innkeeper
anything
i
can
do
for
a
relation
of
her
ladyship
i
think
you
said
a
relation
he
inquired
scarsdale
had
not
said
anything
of
the
kind
but
unwillingly
admitted
that
he
was
her
nephew
upon
receiving
this
intelligence
the
mayor
positively
beamed
called
scarsdale
your
lordship
and
became
most
solicitous
after
lady
melton
health
her
nephew
gravely
assured
him
that
he
might
make
his
mind
easy
on
that
score
as
his
aunt
was
in
the
best
of
health
and
that
as
soon
as
he
returned
to
melton
court
a
most
uncertain
date
he
thought
grimly
he
would
be
sure
to
convey
to
her
his
kind
inquiries
his
worship
on
this
was
positively
effusive
declared
himself
devoted
to
scarsdale
interests
and
insisted
that
he
and
her
ladyship
indicating
allingford
another
slip
which
his
companion
did
not
trouble
to
correct
must
do
him
the
honour
of
dining
with
mayor
and
himself
scarsdale
was
now
beginning
to
fear
that
he
was
doing
it
rather
too
well
and
hastened
to
excuse
her
ladyship
and
himself
declaring
that
they
could
not
think
of
trespassing
on
his
worship
hospitality
and
that
they
would
be
quite
comfortable
at
the
inn
if
only
the
elephant
might
be
permitted
to
have
his
dinner
in
the
square
the
mayor
declared
that
it
was
just
what
he
most
desired
but
would
his
lordship
kindly
indicate
of
what
that
meal
must
consist
this
was
a
poser
but
scarsdale
plunged
recklessly
on
for
having
once
entered
the
broad
road
of
deception
there
was
no
turning
back
and
he
was
surprised
himself
at
the
facility
with
which
he
could
romance
that
is
just
the
trouble
of
taking
charge
of
other
people
pets
he
said
with
shameless
indifference
to
the
demands
of
truth
i
sure
i
do
know
much
more
about
the
brute
than
you
do
and
as
his
mahout
was
away
when
we
started
out
i
had
to
take
one
of
the
grooms
what
jehoshaphat
eat
tom
hay
sir
me
lud
i
mean
answered
tom
falling
in
with
the
humour
of
the
situation
oh
hay
of
course
said
scarsdale
how
much
your
lordship
queried
the
mayor
how
much
confound
it
how
should
i
know
do
you
take
me
for
an
elephant
trainer
a
remark
which
nearly
reduced
his
worship
to
chaos
but
scarsdale
relenting
added
say
five
or
six
tons
i
do
know
but
it
is
not
easy
my
lord
to
procure
such
an
amount
at
short
notice
expostulated
the
official
oh
then
get
him
a
or
two
as
a
first
course
and
find
something
else
a
little
later
it
shall
be
procured
at
once
i
er
trust
your
lordship
will
not
take
it
amiss
since
you
will
not
dine
with
me
if
i
offer
you
a
glass
of
shall
we
say
champagne
with
pleasure
said
scarsdale
and
her
ladyship
looking
towards
the
carriage
allingford
bowed
and
the
mayor
whispered
a
few
words
in
mine
host
ear
just
at
that
moment
as
scarsdale
was
drawing
his
first
easy
breath
feeling
at
last
that
things
were
going
smoothly
the
very
worst
that
could
possibly
happen
occurred
two
dusty
figures
shambled
around
the
corner
of
a
neighbouring
street
into
the
square
and
one
of
them
in
a
voice
that
was
distinctly
heard
by
every
member
of
the
crowd
exclaimed
hi
there
what
are
you
doing
with
my
elephant
scarsdale
swung
round
to
face
the
newcomers
a
premonition
of
coming
evil
strong
upon
him
though
a
careful
inspection
assured
him
that
he
knew
them
not
yet
conviction
hang
in
every
note
of
that
challenge
they
were
in
a
word
the
owner
of
elephants
and
the
unregenerate
dick
from
early
dawn
they
had
made
their
way
across
country
in
as
straight
a
line
as
possible
from
winchester
to
salisbury
sometimes
on
foot
and
sometimes
in
such
conveyances
as
they
could
hire
from
place
to
place
but
ever
buoyed
up
by
hope
hope
of
finding
that
which
was
lost
hope
of
restoring
elephants
to
their
rightful
owners
hope
of
clearing
a
brother
name
and
here
unexpectedly
they
had
come
upon
the
object
of
their
search
in
the
hands
of
total
strangers
who
the
devil
are
you
cried
scarsdale
hotly
scenting
danger
and
determined
to
face
the
worst
at
once
i
do
know
you
i
richard
allingford
said
the
larger
of
the
two
men
pushing
forward
till
he
faced
the
bewildered
englishman
at
this
point
scarsdale
whose
coolness
alone
could
have
saved
the
situation
lost
his
head
his
temper
which
had
been
severely
tried
by
the
vicissitudes
of
the
day
gave
way
in
the
presence
of
the
man
whose
escapades
had
caused
him
such
needless
suffering
and
indignity
and
regardless
of
results
he
spoke
his
mind
so
you
richard
allingford
are
you
then
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
you
are
the
prettiest
scoundrel
that
i
run
across
in
a
long
time
curse
you
do
you
know
i
spent
two
days
this
week
in
winchester
jail
on
your
account
a
broad
grin
broke
over
richard
face
i
guess
you
must
be
scarsdale
he
said
but
what
in
thunder
are
you
doing
with
my
brother
elephant
it
mine
arose
the
shrill
voice
of
his
companion
i
tell
you
he
stole
it
from
me
this
was
too
much
for
allingford
and
to
make
a
bad
matter
worse
she
cried
from
the
carriage
the
consul
did
not
steal
the
elephant
it
is
his
property
and
i
his
wife
a
voice
from
the
crowd
chimed
in
but
said
it
was
ladyship
helephant
the
mayor
face
was
a
study
in
its
various
shades
of
suspicion
anger
at
being
as
he
very
naturally
supposed
duped
and
certainty
of
the
duplicity
of
all
concerned
as
the
contradictory
conversation
continued
and
there
is
no
knowing
how
quickly
he
might
have
precipitated
the
final
catastrophe
if
the
elephant
had
not
chosen
this
opportunity
for
creating
a
diversion
on
his
own
account
which
for
the
time
being
distracted
every
one
thoughts
he
had
had
it
will
be
remembered
a
very
light
breakfast
which
only
served
to
whet
the
edge
of
his
appetite
it
therefore
took
him
but
a
short
time
to
locate
the
whereabouts
of
a
lad
who
emerging
from
the
inn
with
an
appetising
dinner
of
bacon
and
greens
arranged
in
a
basket
balanced
on
his
head
stood
gaping
on
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
unmindful
of
the
cooling
viands
some
playful
breeze
must
have
wafted
the
savoury
odour
of
cabbage
to
the
elephant
nostrils
for
suddenly
and
without
previous
warning
flinging
his
trunk
in
the
air
with
a
joyous
trumpet
he
pounded
down
the
road
nearly
unseating
his
rider
and
scattering
the
crowd
to
right
and
left
wait
for
me
when
you
get
to
christchurch
scarsdale
called
to
tom
as
the
latter
shot
past
him
and
then
joined
in
the
rush
which
followed
close
on
the
elephant
heels
the
mayor
and
the
landlord
well
to
the
fore
while
allingford
driver
who
was
only
human
increased
the
confusion
by
whipping
up
his
horses
and
joining
in
the
chase
ahead
of
the
excited
beast
and
the
noisy
throng
which
followed
it
holding
on
like
grim
death
to
his
fled
the
boy
that
had
ever
been
seen
in
that
town
fortunately
the
chase
was
of
short
duration
for
the
cubicle
of
the
at
the
railway
station
was
just
ahead
and
offered
a
ready
refuge
into
it
flew
the
lad
dinner
and
all
and
slammed
the
door
just
in
time
to
escape
from
the
elephant
curling
trunk
the
beast
despoiled
of
his
meal
circled
the
building
trumpeting
with
rage
and
finally
took
up
a
position
across
the
rails
where
he
stood
guard
prepared
to
fall
upon
any
one
who
should
venture
out
all
the
station
attendants
and
officials
were
now
added
to
the
crowd
which
swarmed
about
the
elephant
and
the
business
of
the
town
practically
came
to
a
standstill
the
only
added
to
the
excitement
by
declaring
that
a
train
for
salisbury
was
due
and
that
the
line
must
be
cleared
while
the
announced
from
an
upper
storey
that
wild
horses
let
alone
elephants
would
not
drag
him
forth
from
the
shelter
of
his
office
and
the
blubbering
of
the
unfortunate
boy
made
a
monotonous
accompaniment
to
his
speech
the
mayor
blustered
the
navvies
swore
tom
addressed
floods
of
unintelligible
jargon
to
the
obstinate
beast
and
as
a
last
resort
scarsdale
coaxed
and
wheedled
him
in
very
defective
hindustani
but
it
was
all
useless
not
an
inch
would
the
elephant
budge
and
no
one
in
all
that
assemblage
was
clever
enough
to
think
of
giving
him
the
dinner
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
a
shrill
whistle
was
heard
in
the
distance
and
some
one
with
a
clearer
head
than
the
rest
cried
out
to
set
the
signals
against
the
train
a
suggestion
which
was
at
once
acted
upon
and
in
a
moment
more
the
engine
drew
up
panting
within
a
dozen
feet
of
the
elephant
who
was
so
intent
on
the
contents
of
the
cubicle
that
he
never
noticed
its
arrival
as
a
general
thing
it
is
the
american
tourist
who
alights
from
a
train
on
no
provocation
while
his
english
cousin
is
content
to
sit
quiet
and
leave
the
affairs
of
the
line
in
the
hands
of
the
company
in
this
case
however
some
subtle
sense
of
the
unusual
obstacle
seemed
to
have
communicated
itself
to
the
passengers
for
no
sooner
had
the
engine
halted
than
heads
were
thrust
out
of
every
window
and
the
greatest
excitement
prevailed
i
do
know
if
scarsdale
and
my
wife
are
here
said
allingford
who
in
company
with
carrington
and
scarsdale
occupied
one
of
the
forward
carriages
but
there
is
her
ladyship
elephant
you
right
cried
his
fair
companion
taking
his
place
at
the
window
then
as
she
caught
sight
of
scarsdale
she
exclaimed
st
hubart
and
pushing
open
the
door
jumped
out
and
fled
down
the
line
by
jove
that
my
wife
exclaimed
the
consul
fleeing
after
her
and
upsetting
a
porter
in
his
haste
from
a
distance
carrington
saw
a
confused
mingling
of
four
persons
and
sighed
as
he
caught
himself
wondering
if
he
would
ever
be
fool
enough
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
in
public
as
he
slowly
approached
them
he
heard
scraps
of
their
conversation
by
the
way
allingford
scarsdale
was
saying
i
brought
you
back
your
elephant
which
it
seems
you
were
careless
enough
in
the
hurry
of
departure
to
leave
behind
you
at
melton
court
i
hope
you
are
properly
grateful
oh
it
is
mine
replied
the
consul
it
belongs
to
her
ladyship
well
she
said
it
was
yours
returned
her
nephew
ah
that
was
merely
her
excessive
amiability
said
allingford
it
had
not
struck
me
in
that
light
before
replied
scarsdale
anyway
i
brought
it
back
to
you
and
a
nice
time
i
had
of
it
did
you
pilot
it
all
the
way
from
melton
court
queried
the
consul
i
did
replied
the
englishman
through
the
main
streets
of
this
town
that
is
where
my
indian
training
stood
me
in
good
stead
but
it
has
ruined
my
character
most
of
the
inhabitants
look
on
me
with
suspicion
was
your
holding
up
of
our
train
intentional
no
said
scarsdale
regretfully
it
was
there
are
lots
of
damages
to
pay
i
assure
you
you
must
settle
them
with
lady
melton
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
the
beast
my
dear
fellow
returned
the
consul
i
been
your
wife
devoted
slave
for
the
last
two
days
and
i
have
restored
her
safe
and
sound
to
your
arms
but
i
really
ca
undertake
to
manage
your
aunt
elephants
into
the
bargain
but
at
least
you
might
advise
me
turn
him
over
to
cassim
to
whom
why
to
his
own
mahout
the
little
brown
man
who
is
dancing
round
him
now
i
discovered
him
tearing
his
hair
at
southampton
station
where
he
was
left
by
mistake
yesterday
and
brought
him
along
then
for
heaven
sake
make
him
get
his
beast
off
the
line
cried
scarsdale
dragging
allingford
up
to
the
native
keeper
my
lord
desireth
his
meal
and
the
sahib
of
the
hath
it
within
explained
that
functionary
tell
his
lordship
that
he
have
a
great
deal
better
dinner
if
he
will
go
back
to
the
square
said
allingford
just
what
the
mahout
said
to
the
elephant
will
never
be
known
but
it
proved
convincing
for
with
a
grunt
of
dissatisfaction
the
beast
consented
to
retrace
his
steps
and
now
that
we
have
settled
this
little
matter
said
the
consul
there
is
nothing
left
for
us
but
to
express
our
unbounded
gratitude
to
well
to
the
elephant
for
reuniting
us
all
and
start
once
more
on
our
honeymoons
for
which
this
train
is
mighty
convenient
i
have
a
word
to
say
about
that
cried
the
mayor
i
by
no
means
satisfied
about
the
ownership
of
this
elephant
i
been
given
to
understand
that
it
belongs
to
lady
melton
is
this
so
yes
said
the
consul
and
and
scarsdale
no
said
allingford
carrington
tom
and
the
original
owner
in
one
and
the
same
breath
i
say
bob
did
you
steal
it
after
all
queried
the
graceless
richard
i
took
it
in

of
a
debt
replied
his
brother
hotly
only
twenty
pounds
groaned
the
elephant
man
it
as
good
as
a
steal
and
i
gave
it
to
lady
melton
continued
the
consul
in
payment
for
my
board
and
lodging
and
she
gave
it
to
me
said
allingford
i
lost
my
lord
at
the
place
of

wailed
the
mahout
me
to
ride
hit
cried
tom
indicating
scarsdale
and
what
right
have
you
to
it
sir
blustered
the
mayor
turning
to
that
gentleman
i
do
know
replied
scarsdale
i
consider
this
most
unsatisfactory
continued
his
worship
i
think
i
may
define
the
actions
of
those
who
have
had
a
hand
in
this
affair
as
ahem
contradictory
and
open
to
question
i
shall
telegraph
lady
melton
and
pending
her
reply
i
must
detain
you
all
as
suspicious
characters
so
it
came
to
pass
that
the
nine
gathered
together
in
the
chief
parlour
of
the
inn
with
a
constable
on
duty
awaited
for
some
hours
a
response
to
the
mayor
telegram
it
arrived
finally
embodied
in
the
person
of
aunt
eliza
who
had
gone
to
melton
court
that
morning
and
was
now
fresh
from
an
interview
with
the
mayor
which
had
resulted
in
the
freedom
of
all
concerned
the
old
lady
looked
the
couples
over
through
her
and
gave
vent
to
an
expressive
humph
to
her
niece
alone
did
she
deign
to
express
herself
more
fully
nor
did
she
scruple
to
mince
her
words
well
mabel
she
remarked
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
i
gave
you
a
recommendation
only
two
days
ago
as
being
well
fitted
to
plan
and
carry
out
a
honeymoon
and
look
what
a
mess
made
of
it
where
did
you
come
from
last
from
winchester
replied
her
niece
where
i
was
looking
for
my
husband
who
had
been
arrested
for
impersonating
brother
and
she
pointed
to
dick
who
joined
the
group
on
hearing
his
name
mentioned
what
business
have
you
to
be
holding
a
public
office
with
a
brother
like
that
miss
cogbill
demanded
sternly
of
the
consul
but
noting
his
evident
discomfiture
she
had
the
grace
to
add
you
by
no
means
a
fool
however
barring
your
habit
of
losing
things
that
deed
of
gift
you
presented
to
lady
melton
was
a
clever
stroke
of
business
and
has
helped
you
all
out
of
a
bad
hole
have
you
seen
her
ladyship
what
did
she
say
cried
the
consul
she
said
a
good
deal
replied
aunt
eliza
naturally
she
was
pretty
mad
for
the
beast
had
done
a
heap
of
damage
but
she
was
bound
to
admit
you
were
to
blame
for
its
getting
loose
and
as
i
pointed
out
to
her
you
had
a
right
to
pay
for
your
board
and
lodging
if
you
chose
though
from
the
looks
of
her
ramshackle
old
place
i
thought
given
more
than
the
accommodation
was
worth
besides
which
there
were
grievances
and
plenty
on
your
side
of
the
question
by
her
own
showing
she
had
been
decently
civil
to
you
and
had
turned
over
that
monster
to
your
deserted
and
defenceless
wife
and
cast
my
nephew
adrift
and
tried
to
send
my
niece
home
with
the
butler
her
ladyship
saw
the
justice
of
my
remarks
she
means
well
but
her
training
against
her
when
i
came
to
the
elephant
though
i
struck
a
snag
for
she
gave
me
to
understand
that
she
turned
it
off
the
place
and
never
wanted
to
hear
of
it
again
your
ladyship
says
i
an
elephant
adrift
in
the
world
is
like
casting
your
bread
upon
the
waters
you
bound
to
find
it
before
many
days
and
i
had
more
than
got
the
words
out
of
my
mouth
when
in
came
that
telegram
from
the
mayor
saying
that
traffic
was
blocked
on
the
railway
in
both
directions
and
nine
people
arrested
all
along
of
that
beast
her
ladyship
lawyer
continued
aunt
eliza
indicating
a
gentleman
of
unmistakably
legal
appearance
who
had
followed
her
into
the
room
backed
me
up
by
pointing
out
that
the
deed
of
gift
was
good
and
the
elephant
her
property
and
that
she
be
obliged
to
pay
for
any
damage
it
might
do
after
which
she
climbed
down
from
her
ancestral
tree
quick
enough
and
was
willing
to
listen
to
reason
so
here
i
am
and
here
is
the
lawyer
and
now
if
you
please
we
will
attend
to
business
this
she
proceeded
to
do
and
in
an
amazingly
short
space
of
time
with
the
authority
of
the
lawyer
had
settled
the
scruples
of
the
mayor
received
a
release
of
indebtedness
from
the
consul
who
willingly
surrendered
his
papers
declaring
that
he
had
had
more
than
twenty
pounds
worth
of
fun
out
of
the
elephant
and
transferred
the
documents
to
the
lawyer
with
instructions
to
sell
the
beast
to
the
original
consignees
at
southampton
and
to
remit
the
to
the
elephant
man
less
the
twenty
pounds
for
damages
which
she
added
just
cancels
his
debt
to
the
consul
making
him
square
on
the
transaction
the
lawyer
patted
his
hands
saying
very
well
argued
miss
cogbill
lady
melton
said
aunt
eliza
turning
to
and
scarsdale
and
and
allingford
has
authorised
me
to
say
on
her
behalf
that
she
overlooks
and
regrets
the
events
of
the
last
few
days
and
wishes
them
to
be
forgotten
in
token
of
which
she
requests
you
four
to
dine
with
her
and
spend
the
night
at
melton
court
and
i
may
add
that
you
be
fools
if
you
do
accept
after
which
dissent
was
impossible
and
i
want
to
tell
you
said
miss
cogbill
turning
to
carrington
that
you
managed
this
affair
very
well
