whatever
may
be
the
truth
of
these
matters
it
is
certain
that
during
the
and
centuries

were

ministers
doctors

frederick
born
july
was
one
of
fifteen
sons
and
daughters
of
whom
ten
attained
maturity
and
several
have
entered
the
lists
of

his
eldest

his
daughter
florence
mrs

the
author
of
his
and
has
written
a
great
many
popular
novels
we
can
record
little
of
marryat
boyhood
beyond
a
general
impression
of
his
discontent
with
and
parents
mr
hannay
is
probably
right
in
regarding
his
hard
pictures
of
home
and
school
life
as
reflections
of
his
own
experience
it
is
said
that
on
one
occasion
he
was
found
to
be
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
knowledge
while
standing
on
his
head
and
that
he
accounted
for
the
circumstance
with
a
humorous
philosophy
almost
worthy
of
jack
easy
well
i
been
trying
for
three
hours
to
learn
it
on
my
feet
but
i
could
so
i
thought
i
would
try
whether
it
would
be
easier
to
learn
it
on
my
head
another
anecdote
of
a
contest
with
his
babbage
is
interesting
and
characteristic
it
appears
that
the
inventor
of
the
calculating
machine
unlike
marryat
was
a
very
diligent
lad
and
that
he
accordingly
arranged
with
some
kindred
spirits
to
begin
work
at
three
in
the
morning
the
restless
marryat
wished
to
join
the
party
but
his
motives
were
suspected
and
the
conspirators
adopted
the
simple
expedient
of
not
waking
him
marryat
rolled
his
bed
across
the
door
and
babbage
pushed
it
away
marryat
tied
a
string
from
his
wrist
to
the
door
handle
and
babbage
unfastened
it
a
thicker
string
was
cut
a
chain
was
unlinked
by
pliers
but
at
last
the
future
captain
forged
a
chain
that
was
too
stout
for
the
future
mathematician
babbage
however
secured
his
revenge
as
soon
as
his
comrade
was
safely
asleep
he
slipped
a
piece
of
pack
thread
through
the
chain
and
carrying
the
other
end
to
his
own
bed
was
enabled
by
a
few
rapid
jerks
to
waken
marryat
whenever
he
chose
apparently
satisfied
with
his
victory
in
the
gentle
art
of
tormenting
babbage
yielded
voluntarily
upon
the
original
point
of
dispute
marryat
and
others
joined
the
reading
party
transformed
it
to
a
scene
of
carnival
and
were
discovered
by
the
authorities
meanwhile
marryat
was
constantly
running
away
to
sea
according
to
his
own
account
because
he
was
obliged
to
wear
his
elder
brother
old
clothes
on
one
occasion
his
father
injudiciously
sent
him
back
in
a
carriage
with
some
money
in
his
pocket
the
wise
youth
slipped
out
and
finding
his
way
home
by
some
quiet
approach
carried
off
his
younger
brothers
to
the
theatre
he
finally
ran
away
from
a
private
tutor
and
mr
marryat
recognised
the
wisdom
of
compliance
being
then
fourteen
that
is
of
age
to
hold
a
commission
frederick
was
allowed
to
enter
the
navy
and
on
the
of
september
he
started
on
his
first
voyage
on
board
captain
lord
cochrane
for
the
mediterranean
he
could
scarcely
have
entered
upon
his
career
under
better
auspices
in
a
ship
he
would
have
had
no
chance
of
service
at
this
stage
of
the
war
when
the
most
daring
of
the
french
could
not
be
decoyed
out
of
port
but
the
frigates
had
always
more
exciting
work
on
hand
than
mere
patrolling
there
were
cruisers
to
be
captured
privateers
to
be
cut
off
convoys
to
be
taken
and
work
to
be
done
on
the
coast
among
the
forts
and
lord
cochrane
earl
of
dundonald
was
not
the
man
to
neglect
his
opportunities
his
daring
gallantry
and
cool
judgment
are
accredited
to
most
of
marryat
captains
particularly
in
where
the
cruise
of
the
along
the
spanish
coast
is
most
graphically
and
literally
described
betrays
the
strong
stern
individuality
of
the
man
invaluable
in
action
somewhat
disturbing
in
civil
life
as
a
reformer
in
season
and
out
of
season
at
the
admiralty
or
in
the
house
of
commons
his
zeal
became
a
but
marryat
knew
him
only
on
board
his
frigate
as
an
inspiring
leader
of
men
he
never
passed
an
opportunity
of
serving
his
country
and
winning
renown
but
his
daring
was
not
reckless
i
must
here
remark
says
marryat
in
his
private
log
that
i
never
knew
any
one
so
careful
of
the
lives
of
his
ship
company
as
lord
cochrane
or
any
one
who
calculated
so
closely
the
risks
attending
any
expedition
many
of
the
most
brilliant
achievements
were
performed
without
loss
of
a
single
life
so
well
did
he
calculate
the
chances
and
one
half
the
merit
which
he
deserves
for
what
he
did
accomplish
has
never
been
awarded
him
merely
because
in
the
official
despatches
there
has
not
been
a
long
list
of
killed
and
wounded
to
please
the
appetite
of
the
english
public
marryat
has
left
us
a
graphic
account
of
his
first
day
at
sea
the
sailed
the
admiral
of
the
port
was
one
who
be
obeyed
but
listen
always
to
reason
or
common
sense
the
signal
for
sailing
was
enforced
by
gun
after
gun
the
anchor
was
hove
up
and
with
all
her
stores
on
deck
her
guns
not
even
mounted
in
a
state
of
confusion
unparalleled
from
her
being
obliged
to
hoist
in
faster
than
it
was
possible
she
could
stow
away
she
was
driven
out
of
harbour
to
encounter
a
heavy
gale
a
few
hours
more
would
have
enabled
her
to
proceed
to
sea
with
security
but
they
were
denied
the
consequences
were
appalling
they
might
have
been
fatal
in
the
general
confusion
some
iron
too
near
the
binnacles
had
attracted
the
needle
of
the
compasses
the
ship
was
steered
out
of
her
course
at
midnight
in
a
heavy
gale
at
the
close
of
november
so
dark
that
you
could
not
distinguish
any
object
however
close
the
dashed
upon
the
rocks
between
ushant
and
the
main
the
cry
of
terror
which
ran
through
the
lower
decks
the
grating
of
the
keel
as
she
was
forced
in
the
violence
of
the
shocks
which
convulsed
the
frame
of
the
vessel
the
hurrying
up
of
the
ship
company
without
their
clothes
and
then
the
enormous
wave
which
again
bore
her
up
and
carried
her
clean
over
the
reef
will
never
be
effaced
from
my
memory
this
after
all
was
not
an
inappropriate
introduction
to
the
stormy
three
years
which
followed
it
the
story
is
written
in
the
novels
particularly
mildmay
where
every
item
of
his
varied
and
exciting
experience
is
reproduced
with
dramatic
effect
it
would
be
impossible
to
rival
marryat
narrative
of
episodes
and
we
shall
gain
no
sense
of
reality
by
adjusting
the
materials
of
fiction
to
an
exact
accordance
with
fact
he
says
that
these
books
except
mildmay
are
wholly
fictitious
in
characters
in
plot
and
in
events
but
they
are
none
the
less
truthful
pictures
of
his
life
at
sea
contains
a
history
of
the
it
is
from
and
his
companions
that
we
must
learn
what
marryat
thought
and
suffered
while
on
board
under
cochrane
he
cruised
along
the
coast
of
france
from
ushant
to
the
mouth
of
the
gironde
saw
some
active
service
in
the
mediterranean
and
after
a
return
to
the
ocean
was
finally
engaged
in
the
basque
roads
a
page
of
his
private
log
contains
a
lively
of
the
whole
experience
the
cruises
of
the
were
periods
of
continual
excitement
from
the
hour
in
which
she
hove
up
her
anchor
till
she
dropped
it
again
in
port
the
day
that
passed
without
a
shot
being
fired
in
anger
was
to
us
a
blank
day
the
boats
were
hardly
secured
on
the
booms
than
they
were
cast
loose
and
out
again
the
yard
and
stay
tackles
were
forever
hoisting
up
and
lowering
down
the
expedition
with
which
parties
were
formed
for
service
the
rapidity
of
the
frigate
movements
night
and
day
the
hasty
sleep
snatched
at
all
hours
the
waking
up
at
the
report
of
the
guns
which
seemed
the
only
keynote
to
the
hearts
of
those
on
board
the
beautiful
precision
of
our
fire
obtained
by
constant
practice
the
coolness
and
courage
of
our
captain
inoculating
the
whole
of
the
ship
company
the
suddenness
of
our
attacks
the
gathering
after
the
combat
the
killed
lamented
the
wounded
almost
envied
the
powder
so
burnt
into
our
face
that
years
could
not
remove
it
the
proved
character
of
every
man
and
officer
on
board
the
implicit
trust
and
adoration
we
felt
for
our
commander
the
ludicrous
situations
which
would
occur
in
the
extremest
danger
and
create
mirth
when
death
was
staring
you
in
the
face
the
escapes
and
the
indifference
to
life
shown
by
all
when
memory
sweeps
along
these
years
of
excitement
even
now
my
pulse
beats
more
quickly
with
the
reminiscence
after
some
comparatively
colourless
service
in
other
frigates
during
which
he
gained
the
personal
familiarity
with
west
indian
life
of
which
his
novels
show
many
traces
he
completed
his
time
as
a
midshipman
and
in
returned
home
to
pass
as
a
lieutenant
his
cruises
were
uneventful
and
after
being
several
times
invalided
he
was
promoted
commander
in
just
as
the
great
war
was
closing
he
was
now
only
and
had
certainly
received
an
admirable
training
for
the
work
with
which
he
was
soon
to
enchant
the
public
though
never
present
at
a
great
battle
and
many
good
officers
were
in
the
same
position
he
had
seen
much
smart
service
and
knew
from
others
what
lay
beyond
his
own
experience
he
evidently
took
copious
notes
of
all
he
saw
and
heard
he
had
sailed
in
the
north
sea
in
the
channel
in
the
mediterranean
and
along
the
eastern
coast
of
america
from
nova
scotia
to
surinam
he
had
been
rapidly
promoted
it
is
tolerably
obvious
that
both
as
midshipman
and
lieutenant
he
evinced
the
cool
daring
and
manly
independence
that
characterises
his
heroes
with
a
dash
perhaps
of
jack
easy
philosophy
it
was
a
rough
life
and
he
was
not
naturally
amenable
to
discipline
but
probably
his
superiors
made
a
favourite
of
the
dashing
handsome
lad
the
habit
which
helps
to
redeem
frank
mildmay
and
even
graces
peter
simple
of
saving
others
from
drowning
was
always
his
own
his
daughter
records
with
pardonable
pride
that
he
was
presented
while
in
the
navy
with

for
having

at
the

his
own
besides
receiving
a
gold
medal
from
the
humane
society
during
the
peace
of
he
occupied
himself
in
acquiring
a
perfect
knowledge
of
such
branches
of
science
as
might
prove
useful
should
the
lords
of

think
fit
to
employ
him
in
a
voyage

discovery
or
survey
a

projected

africa
was
however
relinquished
on
account
of
his
marriage
with
catherine
second
daughter
of
sir
stephen
shairp
of
houston
linlithgow
for
many
years
her
britannic
majesty
and
twice
at
the
court
of
russia
which
took
place
in
january
in
this
same
year
he
was
elected
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
according
to
tradition
on
account
of
his
skill
in
drawing
caricatures
he
was
at
sea
again
soon
after
his
marriage
as
commander
of
the
sloop
in
which
commission
he
was
sent
to
mount
guard
over
napoleon
at
st
helena
until
his
death
he
took
a
sketch
of
the
dead
emperor
in
full
profile
which
was
engraved
in
england
and
france
and
considered
a
striking
likeness
he
was
meanwhile
no
doubt
perfecting
the
code
of
signals
for
the
use
of
merchant
vessels
of
all
nations
including
the
cipher
for
secret
correspondence
which
was
immediately
adopted
and
secured
to
its
inventor
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honour
from
louis
philippe
it
was
not
actually
published
in
book
form
till
from
which
date
its
sale
produced
an
appreciable
income
after
returning
in
the
with
the
despatches
concerning
napoleon
death
he
was
sent
to
escort
the
body
of
queen
caroline
to
cuxhaven
he
was
then
told
off
for
revenue
duty
in
the
channel
and
had
some
smart
cruising
for
smugglers
until
the
was
pronounced
unseaworthy
and
paid
off
on
the
of
february
as
a
result
of
this
experience
he
wrote
a
long
despatch
to
the
admiralty
in
which
he
freely
criticised
the
working
of
the
preventive
service
and
made
some
practical
suggestions
for
its
improvement
in
he
also
published
for
the
abolition
of
the
present
system
of
impressment
in
the
naval
a
pamphlet
which
is
said
to
have
made
him
unpopular
with
royalty
he
frequently
in
his
novels
urges
the
same
reform
which
he
very
earnestly
desired
he
was
appointed
to
the
in
march
and
saw
some
hard
service
against
the
burmese
for
which
he
received
the
thanks
of
the
general
and
the
indian
government
the
companionship
of
the
bath
and
the
command
of
the
two
years
later
in
november
he
resigned
his
ship
and
quitted
active
service
according
to
mrs
lean
because
of
his
appointment
as
equerry
to
his
royal
highness
the
duke
of
sussex
he
was
probably
influenced
however
by
a
distaste
for
routine
duties
in
time
of
peace
the
claims
of
a
growing
family
and
literary
ambitions
he
had
already
published
and
received
for
it
the
handsome
sum
of
and
negotiations
were
very
possibly
on
foot
concerning
king
of
which
the
composition
had
been
completed
there
is
considerable
difficulty
in
following
the
remainder
of
life
owing
to
the
silence
of
our
only
authority
mrs
lean
no
reasons
can
be
assigned
for
the
sudden
flittings
in
which
he
constantly
indulged
or
for
his
hasty
journeys
to
america
and
to
the
continent
he
was
clearly
impulsive
in
all
things
and
though
occasionally
shrewd
betrayed
a
mania
for
speculation
moreover
he
was
naturally
addicted
to
the
bohemian
pleasures
of
life
being
somewhat
promiscuous
in
hospitality
and
absolutely
prodigal
in
the
art
of
making
presents
to
satisfy
these
various
demands
on
his
pocket
he
was
often
driven
to
spells
of
desperate
work
in
spite
of
the
really
handsome
sums
he
received
from
the
publishers
and
editors
with
whom
he
was
always
at
variance
his
first
regular
establishment
was
sussex
house
hampstead
which
he
soon
swapped
after
dinner
and
champagne
for
a
small
estate
of
acres
at
langham
norfolk
though
he
did
not
finally
settle
in
the
country
till
his
original
occupation
of
langham
which
realised
him
a
steady
annual
deficit
was
followed
by
a
return
to
london
a
visit
to
brighton
and
in
a
journey
on
the
continent
to
brussels
and
lausanne
he
had
meanwhile
been
contributing
to
metropolitan
magazine
which
he
edited
from
to
finally
selling
his
proprietary
rights
to
saunders
and
otley
for
his
editorial
work
was
arduous
and
many
of
his
own
compositions
were
first
published
in
here
appeared
forster
simple
faithful
midshipman
easy
and
in
search
of
a
besides
a
comedy
in
three
acts
entitled
gipsy
a
tragedy
called
cavalier
of
seville
and
the
miscellaneous
papers
afterwards
collected
under
the
title
in
he
stood
as
a
reformer
for
tower
hamlets
but
his
methods
of
canvassing
were
imprudent
he
dwelt
upon
his
own
hobbies
and
disregarded
those
of
the
electors
he
apparently
expected
to
carry
the
day
by
opposing
the
pressgang
in
a
time
of
peace
and
even
permitted
himself
to
repudiate
philanthropy
towards
the
african
negro
the
gallantry
with
which
on
one
occasion
he
saved
the
lives
of
his
audience
when
the
floor
of
the
room
had
fallen
in
was
not
permitted
to
cover
the
rash
energy
of
his
reply
to
a
persistent
questioner
if
ever
you
or
one
of
your
sons
should
come
under
my
command
at
sea
and
deserve
punishment
if
there
be
no
other
effectual
mode
of
conferring
it
shall
flog
you
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
add
that
he
lost
the
election
he
afterwards
failed
in
a
plan
for
the
establishment
of
brevet
rank
in
the
army
but
gave
some
valuable
assistance
in
the
preparation
of
the
merchant
shipping
bill
of
it
was
about
this
time
that
marryat
is
currently
reported
to
have
challenged
maurice
to
a
duel
the
latter
had
published
an
anonymous
novel
called
conway
in
which
a
prominent
character
represented
in
no
amiable
colours
bore
the
name
of
captain
marryat
the
truth
of
the
story
seems
to
be
that
the
captain
went
in
hot
wrath
to
bentley
and
demanded
an
apology
or
a
statement
that
the
coincidence
was
unintentional
maurice
replied
through
his
publisher
that
he
had
never
heard
of
captain
marryat
it
may
be
questioned
whether
the
apology
was
not
more
galling
than
the
original
offence
in
some
legal
difficulties
arose
in
connection
with
his
memory
which
marryat
accepted
with
admirable
philosophy
as
for
the
chancellor
judgment
he
told
his
mother
i
can
not
say
that
i
thought
anything
about
it
on
the
contrary
it
appears
to
me
that
he
might
have
been
much
more
severe
if
he
had
thought
proper
it
is
easy
to
impute
motives
and
difficult
to
disprove
them
i
thought
considering
his
enmity
that
he
let
us
off
cheap
as
there
is
no
a
chancellor
and
he
might
say
what
he
pleased
with
impunity
i
did
not
therefore
i
only
the
effect
will
be
nugatory
not
one
in
a
thousand
will
read
it
those
who
do
know
it
refers
to
a
person
not
in
this
world
and
of
those
those
who
knew
my
father
will
not
believe
it
those
who
did
not
will
care
little
about
it
and
forget
the
name
in
a
week
had
he
given
the
decision
in
our
favour
i
should
have
been
better
pleased
it
no
use
crying
what
done
ca
be
helped
this
letter
was
written
from
brighton
and
the
following
year
found
marryat
on
the
continent
at
home
in
a
circle
of
gay
spirits
who
might
almost
be
called
the
outcasts
of
english
society
they
were
by
no
means
necessarily
depraved
but
by
narrow
incomes
or
other
causes
driven
into
a
cheerful
exile
the
captain
was
always
ready
to
give
and
take
in
the
matter
of
entertainment
and
he
was
invited
everywhere
though
on
one
occasion
at
least
it
is
recorded
that
he
proved
an
uncongenial
guest
having
dined
as
a
recognised
lion
among
lions
he
did
make
a
single
joke
during
the
whole
evening
his
host
remarked
on
his
silence
the
next
morning
and
marryat
replied
oh
if
that
what
you
wanted
you
should
have
asked
me
when
you
were
alone
why
did
you
imagine
i
was
going
to
let
out
any
of
my
jokes
for
those
fellows
to
put
in
their
next
books
no
that
is
not
plan
when
i
find
myself
in
such
company
i
open
my
ears
and
hold
my
tongue
glean
all
i
can
and
give
them
nothing
in
return
he
did
not
always
however
play
the
professional
author
so
offensively
and
we
hear
of
his
taking
part
in
private
theatricals
and
dances
preparing
a
christmas
tree
for
the
children
and
cleverly
packing
his
friends
portmanteaux
meanwhile
he
was
writing
pirate
and
three
cutters
for
which
he
received
as
well
as
and
the
of
many
he
had
been
contributing
to
the
at
guineas
a
sheet
until
he
paid
a
flying
visit
to
england
in
in
order
to
transfer
his
allegiance
to
the
monthly
magazine
from
which
he
secured
guineas
mrs
lean
states
that
her
father
received
each
for
simple
jacob
faithful
japhet
and
pacha
of
many
tales
for
easy
for
and
for
the
in
yet
although
captain
marryat
and
his
publishers
mutually
benefited
by
their
transactions
with
each
other
one
would
have
imagined
from
the
letters
exchanged
between
them
that
they
had
been
natural
enemies
she
relates
how
one
of
the
fraternity
told
marryat
he
was
somewhat
eccentric
an
odd
creature
and
added
i
am
somewhat
myself
and
therefore
make
allowance
for
yours
which
is
certainly
warm
enough
marryat
justified
the
charge
by
replying
there
was
no
occasion
for
you
to
make
the
admission
that
you
are
somewhat
your
letter
establishes
that
fact
considering
your
age
you
are
a
little
volcano
and
if
the
insurance
were
aware
of
your
frequent
visits
at
the
royal
exchange
they
would
demand
double
premium
for
the
building
indeed
i
have
my
surmises
as
to
the
last
conflagration
your
remark
as
to
the
money
i
have
received
may
sound
well
mentioned
as
an
isolated
fact
but
how
does
it
sound
when
it
is
put
in
juxtaposition
with
the
sums
you
have
received
i
who
have
found
everything
receiving
a
pittance
while
you
who
have
found
nothing
but
the
shop
to
sell
in
receiving
such
a
lion
share
i
assert
again
that
it
is
slavery
i
am
sinbad
the
sailor
and
you
are
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
clinging
on
my
back
and
you
must
not
be
surprised
at
my
wishing
to
throw
you
off
the
first
convenient
opportunity
the
fact
is
you
have
the
vice
of
old
age
very
strong
upon
you
and
you
are
blinded
by
it
but
put
the
question
to
your
sons
and
ask
them
whether
they
consider
the
present
agreement
fair
let
them
arrange
with
me
and
do
you
go
and
read
your
bible
we
all
have
our
ideas
of
paradise
and
if
other
authors
think
like
me
the
most
pleasurable
portion
of
anticipated
bliss
is
that
there
will
be
no
publishers
there
that
idea
often
supports
me
after
an
interview
with
one
of
your
fraternity
marryat
only
returned
to
england
a
few
months
before
hurrying
off
to
america
in
april
the
reasons
for
this
move
it
is
impossible
to
conjecture
as
we
can
scarcely
accept
the
apparent
significance
of
his
comments
on
switzerland
in
the
on
the
continent
do
the
faults
of
these
people
arise
from
the
peculiarity
of
their
constitutions
or
from
the
nature
of
their
government
to
ascertain
this
one
must
compare
them
with
those
who
live
under
similar
institutions
must
go
to
america
that
is
he
was
received
by
the
americans
with
a
curious
mixture
of
suspicion
and
enthusiasm
english
men
and
women
of
letters
in
late
years
had
been
visiting
the
republic
and
criticising
its
institutions
to
the
mother
country
with
a
certain
forgetfulness
of
hospitalities
received
that
was
not
to
say
the
least
of
it
in
good
taste
marryat
was
also
an
author
and
it
seemed
only
too
probable
that
he
had
come
to
spy
out
the
land
on
the
other
hand
his
books
were
immensely
popular
over
the
water
and
but
for
dread
of
possible
consequences
jonathan
was
delighted
to
see
him
his
arrival
at
saratoga
springs
produced
an
outburst
in
the
local
papers
of
the
most
pronounced
journalese
this
distinguished
writer
is
at
present
a
sojourner
in
our
city
before
we
knew
the
gallant
captain
was
respiring
our
balmy
air
we
really
did
wonder
what
laughing
gas
had
imbued
our
atmosphere
every
one
we
met
in
the
streets
appeared
to
be
in
such
a
state
of
jollification
but
when
we
heard
that
the
author
of
was
actually
puffing
a
cigar
amongst
us
we
no
longer
marvelled
at
the
pleasant
countenances
of
our
citizens
he
has
often
made
them
laugh
when
he
was
thousands
of
miles
away
surely
now
it
is
but
natural
that
they
ought
to
be
tickled
to
death
at
the
idea
of
having
him
present
the
bostonians
were
proud
to
claim
him
as
a
compatriot
through
his
mother
and
a
nautical
drama
from
his
pen
ocean
wolf
or
the
channel
was
performed
at
new
york
with
acclamation
he
had
some
squabbles
with
american
publishers
concerning
copyright
and
was
clever
enough
to
secure
two
thousand
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
from
messrs
carey
hart
for
his
forthcoming
in
and
phantom
ship
which
latter
first
appeared
in
the
monthly
and
he
evidently
pleased
the
americans
on
the
whole
and
was
not
unfavourably
impressed
by
what
he
saw
but
the
six
volumes
which
he
produced
on
his
return
are
only
respectable
specimens
of
bookmaking
and
do
not
repay
perusal
it
was
indeed
his
own
opinion
that
he
had
already
written
enough
if
i
were
not
rather
in
want
of
money
he
says
in
a
letter
to
his
mother
i
certainly
would
not
write
any
more
for
i
am
rather
tired
of
it
i
should
like
to
disengage
myself
from
the
fraternity
of
authors
and
be
known
in
future
only
in
my
profession
as
a
good
officer
and
seaman
he
had
hoped
to
see
some
service
in
canada
but
the
opportunity
never
came
in
england
to
which
he
returned
in
the
want
of
money
soon
came
to
be
felt
more
seriously
his
father
fortune
had
been
invested
in
the
west
indies
and
began
to
show
diminishing
returns
for
this
and
other
reasons
he
led
a
very
wandering
existence
for
another
four
or
five
years
until
a
year
at
duke
street
st
james
was
followed
by
a
short
stay
with
his
mother
at
wimbledon
house
from
which
he
took
chambers
at
piccadilly
and
then
again
moved
to
spanish
place
manchester
square
apparently
at
this
time
he
made
an
unsuccessful
attempt
to
return
to
active
service
he
was
meanwhile
working
hard
at
jack
masterman
ready
the
poacher
percival
keene
and
living
hard
in
the
merry
circle
of
a
literary
bohemia
with
clarkson
stanfield
rogers
dickens
and
forster
to
whom
were
sometimes
added
lady
blessington
ainsworth
cruickshank
and
lytton
the
rival
interests
served
to
sour
his
spirits
and
weaken
his
constitution
the
publication
of
in
the
newspaper
involved
its
author
in
a
very
pretty
controversy
a
foolish
contributor
to
got
into
a
rage
with
harrison
ainsworth
for
to
write
in
the
weekly
papers
and
expressed
himself
as
follows
if
writing
monthly
fragments
threatened
to
deteriorate
mr
productions
what
must
be
the
result
of
this
habit
captain
marryat
we
are
sorry
to
say
has
taken
to
the
same
line
both
these
popular
authors
may
rely
upon
our
warning
that
they
will
live
to
see
their
laurels
fade
unless
they
more
carefully
cultivate
a
spirit
of
that
which
was
venial
in
a
miserable
starveling
of
grub
street
is
in
the
extravagantly
paid
novelists
of
these
days
the
of
generous
booksellers
mr
ainsworth
and
captain
marryat
ought
to
disdain
such
let
them
eschew
it
without
delay
marryat
reply
was
spirited
and
manly
after
ridiculing
attempt
to
set
up
a
standard
of
and
in
literature
and
humorously
proving
that
an
author
works
were
not
to
be
esteemed
in
proportion
to
the
length
of
time
elapsing
between
their
production
he
turned
to
the
more
serious
and
entirely
honest
defence
that
like
dickens
he
was
supplying
the
lower
classes
with
wholesome
recreation
i
would
rather
write
for
the
instruction
or
even
the
amusement
of
the
poor
than
for
the
amusement
of
the
rich
and
i
would
sooner
raise
a
smile
or
create
an
interest
in
the
honest
mechanic
or
agricultural
labourer
who
requires
relaxation
than
i
would
contribute
to
dispel
the
of
those
who
loll
on
their
couches
and
wonder
in
their
idleness
what
they
shall
do
next
is
the
rich
man
only
to
be
amused
are
mirth
and
laughter
to
be
made
a
luxury
confined
to
the
upper
classes
and
denied
to
the
honest
and
artisan
in
a
moral
point
of
view
i
hold
that
i
am
right
we
are
educating
the
lower
classes
generations
have
sprung
up
who
can
read
and
write
and
may
i
enquire
what
it
is
that
they
have
to
read
in
the
way
of
amusement
for
i
speak
not
of
the
bible
which
is
for
private
examination
they
have
scarcely
anything
but
the
weekly
newspapers
and
as
they
can
not
command
amusement
they
prefer
those
which
create
the
most
excitement
and
this
i
believe
to
be
the
cause
of
the
great
circulation
of
the
dispatch
which
has
but
too
well
succeeded
in
demoralising
the
public
in
creating
disaffection
and
towards
the
government
and
assisting
the
nefarious
views
of
demagogues
and
chartists
it
is
certain
that
men
would
rather
laugh
than
cry
would
rather
be
amused
than
rendered
gloomy
and
discontented
would
sooner
dwell
upon
the
joys
or
sorrows
of
others
in
a
tale
of
fiction
than
brood
over
their
own
supposed
wrongs
if
i
put
good
and
wholesome
food
and
as
i
trust
sound
moral
before
the
lower
classes
they
will
eventually
eschew
that
which
is
coarse
and
disgusting
which
is
only
resorted
to
because
no
better
is
supplied
our
weekly
newspapers
are
at
present
little
better
than
records
of
immorality
and
crime
and
the
effect
which
arises
from
having
no
other
matter
to
read
and
comment
upon
is
of
serious
injury
to
the
morality
of
the
country
i
consider
therefore
that
in
writing
for
the
amusement
and
instruction
of
the
poor
man
i
am
doing
that
which
has
but
been
too
much
neglected
that
i
am
serving
my
country
and
you
surely
will
agree
with
me
that
to
do
so
in
not
dig
the
proudest
englishman
and
as
a
conservative
you
should
commend
rather
than
stigmatise
my
endeavours
in
the
manner
which
you
have
so
hastily
done
it
has
been
said
that
marryat
wandering
ceased
in
and
it
was
in
that
year
that
he
settled
down
at
langham
to
look
after
his
own
estate
langham
is
in
the
northern
division
of
norfolk
half
way
between
and
holt
the
manor
house
says
mrs
lean
without
having
any
great
architectural
pretensions
had
a
certain
unconventional
prettiness
of
its
own
it
was
a
cottage
in
the
elizabethan
style
built
after
the
model
of
one
at
virginia
water
belonging
to
his
late
majesty
george
with
latticed
windows
opening
on
to
flights
of
stone
steps
ornamented
with
vases
of
flowers
and
leading
down
from
the
long
narrow
where
surrounded
by
clarkson
stanfield
illustrations
of
with
which
the
walls
were
clothed
marryat
composed
his
later
works
to
the
lawn
behind
the
house
was
thatched
and
gabled
and
its
pinkish
white
walls
and
round
porch
were
covered
with
roses
and
ivy
which
in
some
parts
climbed
as
high
as
the
roof
itself
in
the
unpublished
fragment
of
his
of
lord
marryat
had
declared
that
retired
sailors
naturally
turned
to
agriculture
and
frequently
made
good
farmers
a
sailor
on
land
he
rather
quaintly
remarks
is
but
a
sort
of
adam
a
new
creature
starting
into
existence
as
it
were
in
his
prime
and
the
greatest
pleasures
of
man
consist
in
imitating
the
deity
in
his
power
the
anticipated
in
farming
he
did
to
a
great
extent
realise
but
the
were
still
to
seek
it
can
only
be
said
that
his
losses
were
rather
smaller
that
they
had
been
in
his
absence
thus
total
receipts
expenditure
total
receipts
expenditure
his
former
tenant
had
indeed
shown
but
little
respect
for
the
property
besides
taking
all
he
could
out
of
the
land
without
putting
anything
into
it
he
fitted
up
the
of
the
manor
which
in
its
brightest
days
had
been
known
in
the
village
as
the
room
of
thousand
columns
from
an
effect
produced
by
mirrors
set
in
the
panels
of
folding
doors
reflecting
trellised
pillars
with
rows
of
beds
which
he
let
out
to
tramps
at
twopence
a
night
of
these
latter
years
on
the
farm
we
can
gather
some
distinctly
pleasant
impressions
marryat
was
evidently
a
good
master
at
all
times
he
delighted
to
arrange
for
festivities
in
the
servants
hall
but
he
was
also
very
tolerant
to
poachers
and
considered
it
his
first
duty
to
find
work
for
his
men
when
times
were
bad
his
model
pigsties
and
cottages
were
unpopular
but
he
loved
his
animals
and
understood
them
the
chief
merit
of
his
lazy
and
somewhat
asinine
pony
dumpling
consisted
in
his
talent
for
standing
still
upon
this
patient
beast
the
captain
would
occasionally
sally
forth
to
shoot
assisting
his
natural
by
a
curious
invention
of
his
own
a
plain
piece
of
crystal
surrounded
by
a
strip
of
whalebone
hanging
in
front
of
his
right
eye
from
the
brim
of
his
shocking
bad
hat
he
was
a
careless
dresser
but
scrupulously
clean
no
smoker
but
very
fond
of
snuff
he
had
a
fancy
for
pure
white
china
which
had
to
be
procured
from
the
continent
cordial
invitations
from
friends
seldom
drew
him
from
his
labours
and
it
appears
that
in
spite
of
his
son
debts
and
other
domestic
troubles
he
led
a
fairly
contented
existence
among
his
dogs
and
his
children
to
the
latter
though
occasionally
passionate
he
was
a
most
indulgent
father
and
friend
he
never
locked
anything
away
from
them
or
shut
them
out
of
any
room
in
the
house
though
severe
on
falsehood
and
cowardice
he
was
indifferent
to
mischief
and
one
is
certainly
driven
to
pity
for
the
governess
who
was
summoned
to
look
after
them
his
methods
in
this
connection
were
original
he
kept
a
quantity
of
small
articles
for
presents
in
his
secretary
and
at
the
termination
of
each
week
the
children
and
governess
armed
with
a
report
of
their
general
behaviour
were
ushered
with
much
solemnity
into
the
library
to
render
up
an
account
those
who
had
behaved
well
during
the
preceding
seven
days
received
a
prize
because
they
had
been
so
good
and
those
who
had
behaved
ill
also
received
one
in
hopes
that
they
would
never
be
naughty
again
the
governess
was
also
presented
with
a
gift
that
her
criticism
on
the
justice
of
the
transaction
might
be
disarmed
the
father
was
not
a
strict
disciplinarian
and
it
is
related
that
when
a
little
one
had
made
a
large
rent
in
a
new
frock
for
which
she
expected
punishment
from
her
governess
and
ran
to
him
for
advice
he
took
hold
of
the
rent
and
tore
off
the
whole
lower
part
of
the
skirt
saying
tell
her
i
did
it
the
sons
were
seldom
at
home
but
in
spite
of
a
certain
constitutional
wildness
and
lack
of
prudence
they
were
evidently
a
gallant
couple
delighting
their
father
heart
frederick
the
eldest
became
a
distinguished
officer
after
conquering
a
strong
propensity
to
practical
joking
and
was
much
regretted
in
the
service
when
wrecked
at
the
age
of
he
was
last
seen
upbraiding
in
his
jocular
manner
some
people
who
were
frightened
when
a
sea
swept
over
the
ship
and
took
him
with
it
frank
was
entered
upon
the
roll
of
the
navy
at
the
tender
age
of
three
and
presented
to
the
port
admiral
of
plymouth
in
full
costume
the
officer
patted
him
on
the
head
saying
well
you
a
fine
little
fellow
to
which
the
youngster
replied
and
you
a
fine
old
cock
too
he
became
a
cultivated
and
bold
traveller
beloved
by
his
friends
and
not
unknown
to
fame
he
only
survived
his
father
a
few
years
and
died
at
the
age
of
marryat
now
began
his
charming
series
of
stories
for
children
a
work
to
which
he
turned
for
a
practical
reason
that
sounds
strangely
from
his
impulsive
lips
i
have
lately
taken
to
a
different
style
of
writing
that
is
for
young
people
my
former
productions
like
all
novels
have
had
their
day
and
for
the
present
at
least
will
sell
no
more
but
it
is
not
so
with
the
they
have
an
annual
demand
and
become
little
income
me
which
i
infinitely
prefer
to
receiving
any
sum
in
a
mass
which
very
soon
disappears
somehow
or
other
save
for
a
little
tendency
to
preachment
these
volumes
particularly
and
children
of
the
new
are
admirably
suited
to
their
purpose
from
the
genuine
childlikeness
of
their
conception
and
treatment
meanwhile
marryat
health
was
rapidly
giving
way
and
almost
his
last
appearance
before
the
public
was
in
when
he
addressed
a
pathetic
but
fairly
dignified
letter
to
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
as
a
protest
against
some
affront
which
he
suspected
to
his
professional
career
the
exact
circumstances
of
the
case
can
not
be
now
discovered
but
it
may
be
readily
conjectured
that
the
formalism
of
official
courtesy
did
not
match
with
the
captain
taste
and
that
the
necessity
for
on
his
own
part
had
irritated
his
resentment
the
first
lord
expressed
his
regret
at
having
wounded
a
distinguished
officer
and
bestowed
on
him
a
good
service
pension
it
may
be
said
that
the
pension
came
too
late
if
indeed
it
would
at
any
time
have
been
particularly
serviceable
marryat
was
now
engaged
in
that
melancholy
chase
for
health
which
generally
augurs
the
beginning
of
the
end
he
had
ruptured
two
blood
vessels
and
was
in
great
danger
from
the
constitutional
weakness
which
had
first
attacked
him
as
a
young
lieutenant
in
the
west
indies
he
moved
to
his
mother
house
in
order
to
consult
the
london
doctors
a
mild
climate
was
recommended
and
he
went
down
to
hastings
where
the
news
of
his
son
death
destroyed
his
own
chances
of
recovery
after
about
a
month
trial
of
brighton
he
came
back
to
the
london
doctors
who
told
him
that
in
six
months
he
would
be
numbered
with
his
forefathers
he
went
home
to
langham
to
die
through
the
summer
of
he
lingered
on
in
the
of
a
thousand
columns
with
the
mimic
sky
and
birds
and
flowers
above
and
around
him
where
he
chose
to
lie
upon
a
mattress
placed
on
the
ground
and
there
almost
in
darkness
often
in
pain
and
without
occupation
he
lay
cheerful
and
uncomplaining
and
at
times
even
humorous
his
daughters
frequently
read
aloud
to
him
and
he
always
asked
for
fresh
flowers
at
the
last
he
became
delirious
though
continuing
to
dictate
pages
of
talk
and
reflection
on
the
morning
of
august
he
expired
in
perfect
quiet
although
not
handsome
says
mrs
lean
captain
marryat
personal
appearance
was
very
prepossessing
in
figure
he
was
upright
and
for
his
height
which
measured
his
hands
without
being
undersized
were
remarkably
perfect
in
form
and
modelled
by
a
sculptor
at
rome
on
account
of
their
symmetry
the
character
of
his
mind
was
borne
out
by
his
features
the
most
salient
expression
of
which
was
the
frankness
of
an
open
heart
the
firm
decisive
mouth
and
massive
thoughtful
forehead
were
redeemed
from
heaviness
by
the
humorous
light
that
twinkled
in
his
grey
eyes
which
bright
as
diamonds
positively
flashed
out
their
fun
or
their
reciprocation
of
the
fun
of
others
as
a
young
man
dark
crisp
curls
covered
his
head
but
later
in
life
when
having
exchanged
the
sword
for
the
pen
and
the
plougshare
sic
he
affected
a
soberer
and
more
patriarchal
style
of
dress
and
manner
he
wore
his
grey
hair
long
and
almost
down
to
his
shoulder
his
eyebrows
were
not
alike
one
being
higher
up
and
more
arched
than
the
other
which
peculiarity
gave
his
face
a
look
of
enquiry
even
in
repose
in
the
upper
lip
was
a
deep
cleft
and
in
the
chin
as
deep
a
dimple
christopher
north
describes
captain
marryat
as
a
captain
in
the
navy
and
an
honour
to
it
an
admirable
sailor
and
an
admirable
writer
and
would
that
he
were
with
us
on
the
leads
my
lads
for
a
pleasanter
fellow
those
who
know
him
never
enlivened
the
social
board
it
is
evident
indeed
that
an
intimate
knowledge
of
his
character
was
necessary
to
its
appreciation
for
his
daughter
declares
that
like
most
people
he
was
quick
to
take
offence
and
no
one
could
have
decided
after
an
absence
of
six
months
with
whom
he
was
friends
and
with
whom
he
was
not
one
of
the
said
friends
wrote
truly
his
faults
proceeded
from
an
mind
which
could
never
be
quiet
morning
noon
or
night
if
he
had
no
one
to
love
he
quarrelled
for
want
of
something
better
to
do
he
planned
for
himself
and
for
everybody
and
changed
his
mind
ten
times
many
people
have
asked
says
mrs
lean
whether
captain
marryat
when
at
home
was
not
funny
no
decidedly
not
in
society
with
new
topics
to
discuss
and
other
wits
about
him
on
which
to
sharpen
his
own
or
like
flint
and
steel
to
emit
sparks
by
friction
he
was
as
gay
and
humorous
as
the
best
of
them
but
at
home
he
was
always
a
thoughtful
and
at
times
a
very
grave
man
for
he
was
not
exempt
from
those
ills
that
all
flesh
is
heir
to
and
had
his
sorrows
and
his
difficulties
and
moments
of
depression
like
the
rest
of
us
at
such
times
it
was
dangerous
to
thwart
and
disturb
him
for
he
was
a
man
of
strong
passions
and
indomitable
determination
it
is
not
difficult
to
conceive
the
character
in
outline
wise
captain
marryat
kingsley
calls
him
he
was
incapable
of
any
mean
low
vices
but
his
zest
for
pleasure
was
keen
and
never
restrained
by
motives
of
prudence
or
consideration
for
others
his
strong
passions
at
times
made
him
disagreeably
selfish
and
overbearing
qualities
forgiven
by
acquaintances
for
his
social
brilliancy
and
by
friends
for
his
frank
affection
with
some
business
talents
and
practical
shrewdness
he
was
quite
incapable
of
wisely
conducting
his
affairs
by
reason
of
a
mania
for
speculation
and
originality
there
was
considerable
waste
of
good
material
in
his
fiery
composition
his
books
reveal
the
higher
standard
of
his
true
nature
their
merits
and
faults
are
alike
on
the
surface
lockhart
declared
that
he
stood
second
in
merit
to
no
living
novelist
but
miss
edgeworth
his
happy
delineations
and
contrasts
of
character
and
easy
play
of
native
fun
redeem
a
thousand
faults
of
verbosity
clumsiness
and
coarseness
his
strong
sense
and
utter
superiority
to
affectation
of
all
sorts
command
respect
and
in
his
quiet
effectiveness
of
circumstantial
narrative
he
sometimes
approaches
old
defoe
it
is
easy
to
criticise
marryat
for
his
grammar
is
reckless
he
could
not
construct
a
plot
he
wrote
too
much
and
too
rapidly
in
order
to
earn
money
but
then
he
was
an
altogether
admirable
and
for
the
purposes
of
narration
his
style
was
peculiarly
appropriate
simple
rapid
lucid
and
vigorous
he
does
not
tax
our
powers
of
belief
beyond
endurance
or
weary
us
with
wonder
his
crises
are
the
more
effective
from
the
absence
of
any
studied
introduction
or
thunderous
comment
and
he
carries
his
readers
through
stirring
adventures
of
storm
and
battle
with
a
precision
that
silences
doubt
he
breathes
the
spirit
of
the
sea
himself
a
genuine
sailor
almost
as
childlike
and
simple
as
one
of
his
own
creations
his
books
are
real
voyages
in
which
a
day
of
bustle
and
danger
is
followed
by
peace
and
quiet
yarns
on
the
and
some
practical
joking
among
the
middies
he
delights
in
the
exhibition
of
oddities
and
the
telling
of
tall
stories
outside
the
regular
course
of
the
narrative
which
bubbles
over
with
somewhat
boisterous
fun
and
his
humour
is
genuine
and
spontaneous
it
is
farcical
without
descending
to
buffoonery
his
comic
types
are
built
up
on
character
and
if
not
subtle
are
undeniably
human
and
living
they

i
the
great
advantage
of
being
the
fool
of
the
family
my
destiny
is
decided
and
i
am
consigned
to
a
stockbroker
as
part
of
his
sea
stock
unfortunately
for
me
mr
handycock
is
a
bear
and
i
get
very
little
dinner
if
i
can
not
narrate
a
life
of
adventurous
and
daring
exploits
fortunately
i
have
no
heavy
crimes
to
confess
and
if
i
do
not
rise
in
the
estimation
of
the
reader
for
acts
of
gallantry
and
devotion
in
my
country
cause
at
least
i
may
claim
the
merit
of
zealous
and
persevering
continuance
in
my
vocation
we
are
all
of
us
variously
gifted
from
above
and
he
who
is
content
to
walk
instead
of
to
run
on
his
allotted
path
through
life
although
he
may
not
so
rapidly
attain
the
goal
has
the
advantage
of
not
being
out
of
breath
upon
his
arrival
not
that
i
mean
to
infer
that
my
life
has
not
been
one
of
adventure
i
only
mean
to
say
that
in
all
which
has
occurred
i
have
been
a
passive
rather
than
an
active
personage
and
if
events
of
interest
are
to
be
recorded
they
certainly
have
not
been
sought
by
me
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
and
analyze
my
early
propensities
i
think
that
had
i
been
permitted
to
select
my
own
profession
i
should
in
all
probability
have
bound
myself
apprentice
to
a
tailor
for
i
always
envied
the
comfortable
seat
which
they
appeared
to
enjoy
upon
the
shopboard
and
their
elevated
position
which
enabled
them
to
look
down
upon
the
constant
succession
of
the
idle
or
the
busy
who
passed
in
review
before
them
in
the
main
street
of
the
country
town
near
to
which
i
passed
the
first
fourteen
years
of
my
existence
but
my
father
who
was
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
and
the
youngest
brother
of
a
noble
family
had
a
lucrative
living
and
a
soul
above
buttons
if
his
son
had
not
it
has
been
from
time
immemorial
the
heathenish
custom
to
sacrifice
the
greatest
fool
of
the
family
to
the
prosperity
and
naval
superiority
of
the
country
and
at
the
age
of
fourteen
i
was
selected
as
the
victim
if
the
custom
be
judicious
i
had
no
reason
to
complain
there
was
not
one
dissentient
voice
when
it
was
proposed
before
all
the
varieties
of
my
aunts
and
cousins
invited
to
partake
of
our
festival
i
was
selected
by
general
acclamation
flattered
by
such
an
unanimous
acknowledgment
of
my
qualification
and
a
stroke
of
my
father
hand
down
my
head
which
accompanied
it
i
felt
as
proud
and
alas
as
unconscious
as
the
calf
with
gilded
horns
who
plays
and
mumbles
with
the
flowers
of
the
garland
which
designates
his
fate
to
every
one
but
himself
i
even
felt
or
thought
i
felt
a
slight
degree
of
military
ardour
and
a
sort
of
vision
of
future
grandeur
passed
before
me
in
the
distant
vista
of
which
i
perceived
a
coach
with
four
horses
and
a
service
of
plate
it
was
however
driven
away
before
i
could
decipher
it
by
positive
bodily
pain
occasioned
by
my
elder
brother
tom
who
having
been
directed
by
my
father
to
snuff
the
candles
took
the
opportunity
of
my
abstraction
to
insert
a
piece
of
the
still
ignited
cotton
into
my
left
ear
but
as
my
story
is
not
a
very
short
one
i
must
not
dwell
too
long
on
its
commencement
i
shall
therefore
inform
the
reader
that
my
father
who
lived
in
the
north
of
england
did
not
think
it
right
to
fit
me
out
at
the
country
town
near
to
which
we
resided
but
about
a
fortnight
after
the
decision
which
i
have
referred
to
he
forwarded
me
to
london
on
the
outside
of
the
coach
with
my
best
suit
of
and
six
shirts
to
prevent
mistakes
i
was
booked
in
the
to
be
delivered
to
mr
thomas
handycock
no
saint
clement
lane
carriage
paid
my
parting
with
the
family
was
very
affecting
my
mother
cried
bitterly
for
like
all
mothers
she
liked
the
greatest
fool
which
she
had
presented
to
my
father
better
than
all
the
rest
my
sisters
cried
because
my
mother
cried
tom
roared
for
a
short
time
more
loudly
than
all
the
rest
having
been
chastised
by
my
father
for
breaking
his
fourth
window
in
that
week
during
all
which
my
father
walked
up
and
down
the
room
with
impatience
because
he
was
kept
from
his
dinner
and
like
all
orthodox
divines
he
was
tenacious
of
the
only
sensual
enjoyment
permitted
to
his
cloth
at
last
i
tore
myself
away
i
had
blubbered
till
my
eyes
were
so
red
and
swollen
that
the
pupils
were
scarcely
to
be
distinguished
and
tears
and
dirt
had
veined
my
cheeks
like
the
marble
of
the
my
handkerchief
was
soaked
through
with
wiping
my
eyes
and
blowing
my
nose
before
the
scene
was
over
my
brother
tom
with
a
kindness
which
did
honour
to
his
heart
exchanged
his
for
mine
saying
with
fraternal
regard
here
peter
take
mine
it
as
dry
as
a
bone
but
my
father
would
not
wait
for
a
second
handkerchief
to
perform
its
duty
he
led
me
away
through
the
hall
when
having
shaken
hands
with
all
the
men
and
kissed
all
the
maids
who
stood
in
a
row
with
their
aprons
to
their
eyes
i
quitted
my
paternal
roof
the
coachman
accompanied
me
to
the
place
from
whence
the
stage
was
to
start
having
seen
me
securely
wedged
between
two
fat
old
women
and
having
put
my
parcel
inside
he
took
his
leave
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
on
my
road
to
london
i
was
too
much
depressed
to
take
notice
of
anything
during
my
journey
when
we
arrived
in
london
they
drove
to
the
blue
boar
in
a
street
the
name
of
which
i
have
forgotten
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
such
an
animal
and
certainly
it
did
appear
very
formidable
its
mouth
was
open
and
teeth
very
large
what
surprised
me
still
more
was
to
observe
that
its
teeth
and
hoofs
were
of
pure
gold
who
knows
thought
i
that
in
some
of
the
strange
countries
which
i
am
doomed
to
visit
but
that
i
may
fall
in
with
and
shoot
one
of
these
terrific
monsters
with
what
haste
shall
i
select
those
precious
parts
and
with
what
joy
should
i
on
my
return
pour
them
as
an
offering
of
filial
affection
into
my
lap
and
then
as
i
thought
of
my
mother
the
tears
again
gushed
into
my
eyes
the
coachman
threw
his
whip
to
the
ostler
and
the
reins
upon
the
horses
backs
he
then
dismounted
and
calling
to
me
now
young
gentleman
he
put
a
ladder
up
for
me
to
get
down
by
then
turning
to
a
porter
he
said
to
him
bill
you
must
take
this
here
young
and
that
ere
parcel
to
this
here
please
to
remember
the
coachman
sir
i
replied
that
i
certainly
would
if
he
wished
it
and
walked
off
with
the
porter
the
coachman
observing
as
i
went
away
well
he
is
a
fool
that
sartain
i
arrived
quite
safe
at
st
when
the
porter
received
a
shilling
for
his
trouble
from
the
maid
who
let
me
in
and
i
was
shown
up
into
a
parlour
where
i
found
myself
in
company
with
mrs
handycock
mrs
handycock
was
a
little
meagre
woman
who
did
not
speak
very
good
english
and
who
appeared
to
me
to
employ
the
major
part
of
her
time
in
bawling
out
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
the
servants
below
i
never
saw
her
either
read
a
book
or
occupy
herself
with
needlework
during
the
whole
time
i
was
in
the
house
she
had
a
large
grey
parrot
and
i
really
can
not
tell
which
screamed
the
worse
of
the
two
but
she
was
very
civil
and
kind
to
me
and
asked
me
ten
times
a
day
when
i
had
last
heard
of
my
grandfather
lord
privilege
i
observed
that
she
always
did
so
if
any
company
happened
to
call
in
during
my
stay
at
her
house
before
i
had
been
there
ten
minutes
she
told
me
that
she
hadored
sailors
they
were
the
defendiours
and
preserviours
of
their
kings
and
countries
and
that
mr
handycock
would
be
home
by
four
and
then
we
should
go
to
dinner
then
she
jumped
off
her
chair
to
bawl
to
the
cook
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
jemima
jemima
ve
the
viting
biled
instead
of
fried
ca
marm
replied
jemima
they
be
all
begged
and
crumbed
with
their
tails
in
their
mouths
vell
then
never
mind
jemima
replied
the
do
put
your
finger
into
the
parrot
cage
my
love
he
apt
to
be
cross
with
strangers
mr
handycock
will
be
home
at
four
and
then
we
shall
have
our
dinner
are
you
fond
of
viting
as
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
mr
handycock
and
very
anxious
to
have
my
dinner
i
was
not
sorry
to
hear
the
clock
on
the
stairs
strike
four
when
mrs
handycock
again
jumped
up
and
put
her
head
over
the
banisters
jemima
jemima
it
four
i
hear
it
marm
replied
the
cook
and
she
gave
the
a
twist
which
made
the
hissing
and
the
smell
come
flying
up
into
the
parlour
and
made
me
more
hungry
than
ever
rap
tap
tap
there
your
master
jemima
screamed
the
lady
i
hear
him
marm
replied
the
cook
run
down
my
dear
and
let
mr
handycock
in
said
his
wife
he
be
so
surprised
at
seeing
you
open
the
door
i
ran
down
as
mrs
handycock
desired
me
and
opened
the
who
the
devil
are
you
in
a
gruff
voice
cried
mr
handycock
a
man
about
six
feet
high
dressed
in
blue
pantaloons
and
hessian
boots
with
a
black
coat
and
waistcoat
i
was
a
little
rebuffed
i
must
own
but
i
replied
that
i
was
mr
simple
and
pray
mr
simple
what
would
your
grandfather
say
if
he
saw
you
now
i
have
servants
in
plenty
to
open
my
door
and
the
parlour
is
the
proper
place
for
young
gentlemen
law
mr
handycock
said
his
wife
from
the
top
of
the
stairs
how
can
you
be
so
cross
i
told
him
to
open
the
door
to
surprise
you
and
you
have
surprised
me
replied
he
with
your
cursed
folly
while
mr
handycock
was
rubbing
his
boots
on
the
mat
i
went
upstairs
rather
mortified
i
must
own
as
my
father
had
told
me
that
mr
handycock
was
his
stockbroker
and
would
do
all
he
could
to
make
me
comfortable
indeed
he
had
written
to
that
effect
in
a
letter
which
my
father
showed
to
me
before
i
left
home
when
i
returned
to
the
parlour
mrs
handycock
whispered
to
me
never
mind
my
dear
it
only
because
there
something
wrong
on
mr
handycock
is
a
just
now
i
thought
so
too
but
i
made
no
answer
for
mr
handycock
came
upstairs
and
walking
with
two
strides
from
the
door
of
the
parlour
to
the
turned
his
back
to
it
and
lifting
up
his
began
to
whistle
are
you
ready
for
your
dinner
my
dear
said
the
lady
almost
trembling
if
the
dinner
is
ready
for
me
i
believe
we
usually
dine
at
four
answered
her
husband
gruffly
jemima
jemima
dish
up
do
you
hear
jemima
yes
marm
replied
the
cook
directly
i
thickened
the
butter
and
mrs
handycock
resumed
her
seat
with
well
mr
simple
and
how
is
your
grandfather
lord
privilege
he
is
quite
well
answered
i
for
the
fifteenth
time
at
least
but
dinner
put
an
end
to
the
silence
which
followed
this
remark
mr
handycock
lowered
his
and
walked
downstairs
leaving
his
wife
and
me
to
follow
at
our
leisure
pray
inquired
i
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
hearing
what
is
the
matter
with
mr
handycock
that
he
is
so
cross
to
you
vy
my
dear
it
is
one
of
the
misfortunes
of
that
ven
the
husband
put
out
the
vife
is
sure
to
have
her
share
of
it
mr
handycock
must
have
lost
money
on
and
then
he
always
comes
home
cross
ven
he
vins
then
he
is
as
merry
as
a
cricket
are
you
people
coming
down
to
dinner
roared
mr
handycock
from
below
yes
my
dear
replied
the
lady
i
thought
that
you
were
washing
your
hands
we
descended
into
the
where
we
found
that
mr
handycock
had
already
devoured
two
of
the
whitings
leaving
only
one
on
the
dish
for
his
wife
and
me
vould
you
like
a
little
bit
of
viting
my
dear
said
the
lady
to
me
it
not
worth
halving
observed
the
gentleman
in
a
surly
tone
taking
up
the
fish
with
his
own
knife
and
fork
and
putting
it
on
his
plate
well
i
so
glad
you
like
them
my
dear
replied
the
lady
meekly
then
turning
to
me
there
some
nice
roast
coming
my
dear
the
veal
made
its
appearance
and
fortunately
for
us
mr
handycock
could
not
devour
it
all
he
took
the
lion
share
nevertheless
cutting
off
all
the
brown
and
then
shoving
the
dish
over
to
his
wife
to
help
herself
and
me
i
had
not
put
two
pieces
in
my
mouth
before
mr
handycock
desired
me
to
get
up
and
hand
him
the
which
stood
on
the
sideboard
i
thought
that
if
it
was
not
right
for
me
to
open
a
door
neither
was
it
for
me
to
wait
at
table
but
i
obeyed
him
without
making
a
remark
after
dinner
mr
handycock
went
down
to
the
cellar
for
a
bottle
of
wine
o
deary
me
exclaimed
his
wife
he
must
have
lost
a
mint
of
money
we
had
better
go
up
stairs
and
leave
him
alone
he
be
better
after
a
bottle
of
port
perhaps
i
was
very
glad
to
go
away
and
being
very
tired
i
went
to
bed
without
any
tea
for
mrs
handycock
dared
not
venture
to
make
it
before
her
husband
came
up
stairs
chapter
ii
fitting
out
on
the
shortest
notice
fortunately
for
me
this
day
mr
handycock
is
a
bear
and
i
fare
very
well
i
set
off
for
portsmouth
behind
the
coach
i
meet
a
man
before
the
mast
he
is
disguised
with
liquor
but
is
not
the
only
disguise
i
fall
in
with
in
my
journey
the
next
morning
mr
handycock
appeared
to
be
in
somewhat
better
humour
one
of
the
linendrapers
who
fitted
out
cadets
c
on
the
shortest
notice
was
sent
for
and
orders
given
for
my
equipment
which
mr
handycock
insisted
should
be
ready
on
the
day
afterwards
or
the
articles
would
be
left
on
his
hands
adding
that
my
place
was
already
taken
in
the
portsmouth
coach
really
sir
observed
the
man
i
afraid
on
such
very
short
notice
your
card
says
shortest
notice
rejoined
mr
handycock
with
the
confidence
and
authority
of
a
man
who
is
enabled
to
correct
another
by
his
own
assertions
if
you
do
not
choose
to
undertake
the
work
another
will
this
silenced
the
man
who
made
his
promise
took
my
measure
and
departed
and
soon
afterwards
mr
handycock
also
quitted
the
house
what
with
my
grandfather
and
the
parrot
and
mrs
handycock
wondering
how
much
money
her
husband
had
lost
running
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
talking
to
the
cook
the
day
passed
away
pretty
well
till
four
when
as
before
mrs
handycock
screamed
the
cook
screamed
the
parrot
screamed
and
mr
handycock
rapped
at
the
door
and
was
let
in
but
not
by
me
he
ascended
the
stair
swith
sic
three
bounds
and
coming
into
the
parlour
cried
well

replied
the

and
mrs

followed

into
his
bedroom
on
the
same
floor
to
assist
him
at
his
toilet
by
jove

mr
handycock
as
we
sat
down
to

o

replied
his
wife
giggling
and
so
i
believe
she
was
but
why
i
did
not
understand
mr
simple
said
he
will
you
allow
me
to
offer
you
a
little
fish
if
you
do
not
want
it
all
yourself
sir
replied
i
politely
mrs
handycock
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
me
while
her
husband
helped
me
my
dove
a
bit
of
fish
we
both
had
our
share
and
i
never
saw
a
man
more
polite
than
mr
handycock
he
joked
with
his
wife
asked
me
to
drink
wine
with
him
two
or
three
times
talked
about
my
grandfather
and
in
short
we
had
a
very
pleasant
evening
the
next
morning
all
my
clothes
came
home
but
mr
handycock
who
still
continued
in
good
humour
said
that
he
would
not
allow
me
to
travel
by
night
that
i
should
sleep
there
and
set
off
the
next
morning
which
i
did
at
six
and
before
eight
i
had
arrived
at
the
elephant
and
castle
where
we
stopped
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
was
looking
at
the
painting
representing
this
animal
with
a
castle
on
its
back
and
assuming
that
of
alnwick
which
i
had
seen
as
a
fair
estimate
of
the
size
and
weight
of
that
which
he
carried
was
attempting
to
enlarge
my
ideas
so
as
to
comprehend
the
stupendous
bulk
of
the
elephant
when
i
observed
a
crowd
assembled
at
the
corner
and
asking
a
gentleman
who
sat
by
me
in
a
plaid
cloak
whether
there
was
not
something
very
uncommon
to
attract
so
many
people
he
replied
not
very
for
it
is
only
a
drunken
sailor
i
rose
from
my
seat
which
was
on
the
hinder
part
of
the
coach
that
i
might
see
him
for
it
was
a
new
sight
to
me
and
excited
my
curiosity
when
to
my
astonishment
he
staggered
from
the
crowd
and
swore
that
he
go
to
portsmouth
he
climbed
up
by
the
wheel
of
the
coach
and
sat
down
by
me
i
believe
that
i
stared
at
him
very
much
for
he
said
to
me
what
are
you
gaping
at
you
young
sculping
do
you
want
to
catch
flies
or
did
you
never
see
a
chap
before
i
replied
that
i
had
never
been
at
sea
in
my
life
but
that
i
was
going
well
then
you
like
a
young
bear
all
your
sorrows
to
come
all
my
hearty
replied
he
when
you
get
on
board
you
find
monkey
allowance
more
kicks
than
i
say
you
bring
us
another
pint
of
ale
the
waiter
of
the
inn
who
was
attending
the
coach
brought
out
the
ale
half
of
which
the
sailor
drank
and
the
other
half
threw
into
the
waiter
face
telling
him
that
was
his
allowance
and
now
said
he
what
to
pay
the
waiter
who
looked
very
angry
but
appeared
too
much
afraid
of
the
sailor
to
say
anything
answered
fourpence
and
the
sailor
pulled
out
a
handful
of
banknotes
mixed
up
with
gold
silver
and
coppers
and
was
picking
out
the
money
to
pay
for
his
beer
when
the
coachman
who
was
impatient
drove
off
there
cut
and
run
cried
the
sailor
thrusting
all
the
money
into
his
breeches
pocket
that
what
you
learn
to
do
my
joker
before
you
been
two
cruises
to
sea
in
the
meantime
the
gentleman
in
the
plaid
cloak
who
was
seated
by
me
smoked
his
cigar
without
saying
a
word
i
commenced
a
conversation
with
him
relative
to
my
profession
and
asked
him
whether
it
was
not
very
difficult
to
learn
larn
cried
the
sailor
interrupting
us
no
it
may
be
difficult
for
such
chaps
as
me
before
the
mast
to
larn
but
you
i
presume
is
a
reefer
and
they
a
got
much
to
larn
why
they
their
weekly
accounts
and
walks
up
and
down
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
you
must
larn
to
chaw
baccy
drink
grog
and
call
the
cat
a
beggar
and
then
you
knows
all
a
midshipman
expected
to
know
nowadays
i
right
sir
said
the
sailor
appealing
to
the
gentleman
in
a
plaid
cloak
i
axes
you
because
i
see
you
a
sailor
by
the
cut
of
your
jib
beg
pardon
sir
continued
he
touching
his
hat
hope
no
offence
i
am
afraid
that
you
have
nearly
hit
the
mark
my
good
fellow
replied
the
gentleman
the
drunken
fellow
then
entered
into
conversation
with
him
stating
that
he
had
been
paid
off
from
the
at
portsmouth
and
had
come
up
to
london
to
spend
his
money
with
his
messmates
but
that
yesterday
he
had
discovered
that
a
jew
at
portsmouth
had
sold
him
a
seal
as
gold
for
fifteen
shillings
which
proved
to
be
copper
and
that
he
was
going
back
to
portsmouth
to
give
the
jew
a
couple
of
black
eyes
for
his
rascality
and
that
when
he
had
done
that
he
was
to
return
to
his
messmates
who
had
promised
to
drink
success
to
the
expedition
at
the
cock
and
bottle
st
martin
lane
until
he
should
return
the
gentleman
in
the
plaid
cloak
commended
him
very
much
for
his
resolution
for
he
said
that
although
the
journey
to
and
from
portsmouth
would
cost
twice
the
value
of
a
gold
seal
yet
that
in
the
end
it
might
be
worth
a
what
he
meant
i
did
not
comprehend
whenever
the
coach
stopped
the
sailor
called
for
more
ale
and
always
threw
the
remainder
which
he
could
not
drink
into
the
face
of
the
man
who
brought
it
out
for
him
just
as
the
coach
was
starting
off
and
then
tossed
the
pewter
pot
on
the
ground
for
him
to
pick
up
he
became
more
tipsy
every
stage
and
the
last
from
portsmouth
when
he
pulled
out
his
money
he
could
find
no
silver
so
he
handed
down
a
note
and
desired
the
waiter
to
change
it
the
waiter
crumpled
it
up
and
put
it
into
his
pocket
and
then
returned
the
sailor
the
change
for
a
note
but
the
gentleman
in
the
plaid
had
observed
that
it
was
a
note
which
the
sailor
had
given
and
insisted
upon
the
waiter
producing
it
and
giving
the
proper
change
the
sailor
took
his
money
which
the
waiter
handed
to
him
begging
pardon
for
the
mistake
although
he
coloured
up
very
much
at
being
detected
i
really
beg
your
pardon
said
he
again
it
was
quite
a
mistake
whereupon
the
sailor
threw
the
pewter
pot
at
the
waiter
saying
i
really
beg
your
pardon
too
and
with
such
force
that
it
flattened
upon
the
man
head
who
fell
senseless
on
the
road
the
coachman
drove
off
and
i
never
heard
whether
the
man
was
killed
or
not
after
the
coach
had
driven
off
the
sailor
eyed
the
gentleman
in
the
plaid
cloak
for
a
minute
or
two
and
then
said
when
i
first
looked
at
you
i
took
you
for
some
officer
in
mufti
but
now
that
i
see
you
look
so
sharp
after
the
rhino
it
my
idea
that
you
some
poor
devil
of
a
scotchman
mayhap
second
mate
of
a
marchant
vessel
there
half
a
crown
for
your
services
i
give
you
more
if
i
thought
you
would
spend
it
the
gentleman
laughed
and
took
the
which
i
afterwards
observed
that
he
gave
to
a
beggar
at
the
bottom
of
portsdown
hill
i
inquired
of
him
how
soon
we
should
be
at
portsmouth
he
answered
that
we
were
passing
the
lines
but
i
saw
no
lines
and
i
was
ashamed
to
show
my
ignorance
he
asked
me
what
ship
i
was
going
to
join
i
could
not
recollect
her
name
but
i
told
him
it
was
painted
on
the
outside
of
my
chest
which
was
coming
down
by
the
waggon
all
that
i
could
recollect
was
that
it
was
a
french
name
have
you
no
letter
of
introduction
to
the
captain
said
he
yes
i
have
replied
i
and
i
pulled
out
my
in
which
the
letter
was
captain
savage
ship
continued
i
reading
to
him
to
my
surprise
he
very
coolly
proceeded
to
open
the
letter
which
when
i
perceived
what
he
was
doing
occasioned
me
immediately
to
snatch
the
letter
from
him
stating
my
opinion
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
a
breach
of
honour
and
that
in
my
opinion
he
was
no
gentleman
just
as
you
please
youngster
replied
he
recollect
you
have
told
me
i
am
no
gentleman
he
wrapped
his
plaid
around
him
and
said
no
more
and
i
was
not
a
little
pleased
at
having
silenced
him
by
my
resolute
behaviour
chapter
iii
i
am
made
to
look
very
blue
at
the
blue
posts
find
wild
spirits
around
and
soon
after
hot
spirits
within
me
at
length
my
spirits
overcome
me
call
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
captain
and
find
that
i
had
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
him
before
no
sooner
out
of
one
scrape
than
into
another
when
we
stopped
i
inquired
of
the
coachman
which
was
the
best
inn
he
answered
that
it
was
the
blue
postesses
where
the
midshipmen
leave
their
chestesses
call
for
tea
and
toastesses
and
sometimes
forget
to
pay
for
their
breakfastesses
he
laughed
when
he
said
it
and
i
thought
that
he
was
joking
with
me
but
he
pointed
out
two
large
blue
posts
at
the
door
next
the
and
told
me
that
all
the
midshipmen
resorted
to
that
hotel
he
then
asked
me
to
remember
the
coachman
which
by
this
time
i
had
found
out
implied
that
i
was
not
to
forget
to
give
him
a
shilling
which
i
did
and
then
went
into
the
inn
the
was
full
of
midshipmen
and
as
i
was
anxious
about
my
chest
i
inquired
of
one
of
them
if
he
knew
when
the
waggon
would
come
in
do
you
expect
your
mother
by
it
replied
he
oh
no
but
i
expect
my
uniforms
i
only
wear
these
until
they
come
and
pray
what
ship
are
you
going
to
join
the
captain
thomas
kirkwall
savage
the
i
say
robinson
that
the
frigate
in
which
the
midshipmen
had
four
dozen
apiece
for
not
having
their
weekly
accounts
on
the
saturday
to
be
sure
it
is
replied
the
other
why
the
captain
gave
a
youngster
five
dozen
the
other
day
for
wearing
a
scarlet
he
the
greatest
tartar
in
the
service
continued
the
other
he
flogged
the
whole
starboard
watch
the
last
time
that
he
was
on
a
cruise
because
the
ship
would
only
sail
nine
knots
upon
a
bowline
oh
dear
said
i
then
i
very
sorry
that
i
am
going
to
join
him
my
soul
i
pity
you
you
be
fagged
to
death
for
there
only
three
midshipmen
in
the
ship
now
all
the
rest
ran
away
did
they
robinson
there
only
two
left
now
for
poor
matthews
died
of
fatigue
he
was
worked
all
day
and
kept
watch
all
night
for
six
weeks
and
one
morning
he
was
found
dead
upon
his
chest
god
bless
my
soul
cried
i
and
yet
on
shore
they
say
he
is
such
a
kind
man
to
his
midshipmen
yes
replied
robinson
he
spreads
that
report
every
where
now
observe
when
you
first
call
upon
him
and
report
your
having
come
to
join
his
ship
he
tell
you
that
he
is
very
happy
to
see
you
and
that
he
hopes
your
family
are
well
then
he
recommend
you
to
go
on
board
and
learn
your
duty
after
that
stand
clear
now
recollect
what
i
have
said
and
see
if
it
does
not
prove
true
come
sit
down
with
us
and
take
a
glass
of
grog
it
will
keep
your
spirits
up
these
midshipmen
told
me
so
much
about
my
captain
and
the
horrid
cruelties
which
he
had
practised
that
i
had
some
doubts
whether
i
had
not
better
set
off
home
again
when
i
asked
their
opinion
they
said
that
if
i
did
i
should
be
taken
up
as
a
deserter
and
hanged
that
my
best
plan
was
to
beg
his
acceptance
of
a
few
gallons
of
rum
for
he
was
very
fond
of
grog
and
that
then
i
might
perhaps
be
in
his
good
graces
as
long
as
the
rum
might
last
i
am
sorry
to
state
that
the
midshipmen
made
me
very
tipsy
that
evening
i
do
recollect
being
put
to
bed
but
i
found
myself
there
the
next
morning
with
a
dreadful
headache
and
a
very
confused
recollection
of
what
had
passed
i
was
very
much
shocked
at
my
having
so
soon
forgotten
the
injunctions
of
my
parents
and
was
making
vows
never
to
be
so
foolish
again
when
in
came
the
midshipman
who
had
been
so
kind
to
me
the
night
before
come
mr
bottlegreen
he
bawled
out
alluding
i
suppose
to
the
colour
of
my
clothes
rouse
and
bitt
there
the
captain
coxswain
waiting
for
you
below
by
the
powers
you
in
a
pretty
scrape
for
what
you
did
last
night
did
last
night
replied
i
astonished
why
does
the
captain
know
that
i
was
tipsy
i
think
you
took
devilish
good
care
to
let
him
know
it
when
you
were
at
the
theatre
at
the
theatre
was
i
at
the
theatre
to
be
sure
you
were
you
would
go
do
all
we
could
to
prevent
you
though
you
were
as
drunk
as
david
sow
your
captain
was
there
with
the
admiral
daughters
you
called
him
a
tyrant
and
snapped
your
fingers
at
him
why
do
you
recollect
you
told
him
that
you
did
not
care
a
fig
for
him
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
cried
i
my
mother
cautioned
me
so
about
drinking
and
bad
company
bad
company
you
whelp
what
do
you
mean
by
that
o
i
did
not
particularly
refer
to
you
i
should
hope
not
however
i
recommend
you
as
a
friend
to
go
to
the
george
inn
as
fast
as
you
can
and
see
your
captain
for
the
longer
you
stay
away
the
worse
it
will
be
for
you
at
all
events
it
will
be
decided
whether
he
receives
you
or
not
it
is
fortunate
for
you
that
you
are
not
on
the
ship
books
come
be
quick
the
coxswain
is
gone
back
not
on
the
ship
books
replied
i
sorrowfully
now
i
recollect
there
was
a
letter
from
the
captain
to
my
father
stating
that
he
had
put
me
on
the
books
upon
my
honour
i
sorry
very
sorry
indeed
replied
the
midshipman
and
he
quitted
the
room
looking
as
grave
as
if
the
misfortune
had
happened
to
himself
i
got
up
with
a
heavy
head
and
heavier
heart
and
as
soon
as
i
was
dressed
i
asked
the
way
to
the
george
inn
i
took
my
letter
of
introduction
with
me
although
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
of
little
service
when
i
arrived
i
asked
with
a
trembling
voice
whether
captain
thomas
kirkwall
savage
of
ship
was
staying
there
the
waiter
replied
that
he
was
at
breakfast
with
captain
courtney
but
that
he
would
take
up
my
name
i
gave
it
him
and
in
a
minute
the
waiter
returned
and
desired
that
i
would
walk
up
o
how
my
heart
beat
i
never
was
so
frightened
i
thought
i
should
have
dropped
on
the
stairs
twice
i
attempted
to
walk
into
the
room
and
each
time
my
legs
failed
me
at
last
i
wiped
the
perspiration
from
my
forehead
and
with
a
desperate
effort
i
went
into
the
room
mr
simple
i
am
glad
to
see
you
said
a
voice
i
had
held
my
head
down
for
i
was
afraid
to
look
at
him
but
the
voice
was
so
kind
that
i
mustered
up
courage
and
when
i
did
look
up
there
sat
with
his
uniform
and
epaulets
and
his
sword
by
his
side
the
passenger
in
the
plaid
cloak
who
wanted
to
open
my
letter
and
whom
i
had
told
to
his
face
that
he
was
i
thought
i
should
have
died
as
the
other
midshipman
did
upon
his
chest
i
was
just
sinking
down
upon
my
knees
to
beg
for
mercy
when
the
captain
perceiving
my
confusion
burst
out
into
a
laugh
and
said
so
you
know
me
again
mr
simple
well
do
be
alarmed
you
did
your
duty
in
not
permitting
me
to
open
the
letter
supposing
me
as
you
did
to
be
some
other
person
and
you
were
perfectly
right
under
that
supposition
to
tell
me
that
i
was
not
a
gentleman
i
give
you
credit
for
your
conduct
now
sit
down
and
take
some
breakfast
captain
courtney
said
he
to
the
other
captain
who
was
at
the
table
this
is
one
of
my
youngsters
just
entering
the
service
we
were
passengers
yesterday
by
the
same
coach
he
then
told
him
the
circumstance
which
occurred
at
which
they
laughed
heartily
i
now
recovered
my
spirits
a
little
but
still
there
was
the
affair
at
the
theatre
and
i
thought
that
perhaps
he
did
not
recognize
me
i
was
however
soon
relieved
from
my
anxiety
by
the
other
captain
inquiring
were
you
at
the
theatre
last
night
savage
no
i
dined
at
the
admiral
there
no
getting
away
from
those
girls
they
are
so
pleasant
i
rather
think
you
are
a
little
in
that
quarter
no
on
my
word
i
might
be
if
i
had
time
to
discover
which
i
liked
best
but
my
ship
is
at
present
my
wife
and
the
only
wife
i
intend
to
have
until
i
am
laid
on
the
shelf
well
thought
i
if
he
was
not
at
the
theatre
it
could
not
have
been
him
that
i
insulted
now
if
i
can
only
give
him
the
rum
and
make
friends
with
him
pray
mr
simple
how
are
your
father
and
mother
said
the
captain
very
well
i
thank
you
sir
and
desire
me
to
present
their
compliments
i
am
obliged
to
them
now
i
think
the
sooner
you
go
on
board
and
learn
your
duty
the
better
just
what
the
midshipman
told
me
the
very
words
thought
i
then
it
all
true
and
i
began
to
tremble
again
i
have
a
little
advice
to
offer
you
continued
the
captain
in
the
first
place
obey
your
superior
officers
without
hesitation
it
is
for
me
not
you
to
decide
whether
an
order
is
unjust
or
not
in
the
next
place
never
swear
or
drink
spirits
the
first
is
immoral
and
the
second
is
a
vile
habit
which
will
grow
upon
you
i
never
touch
spirit
myself
and
i
expect
that
my
young
gentlemen
will
refrain
from
it
also
now
you
may
go
and
as
soon
as
your
uniforms
arrive
you
will
repair
on
board
in
the
meantime
as
i
had
some
little
insight
into
your
character
when
we
travelled
together
let
me
recommend
you
not
to
be
too
intimate
at
first
sight
with
those
you
meet
or
you
may
be
led
into
indiscretions
good
morning
i
quitted
the
room
with
a
low
bow
glad
to
have
surmounted
so
easily
what
appeared
to
be
a
chaos
of
difficulty
but
my
mind
was
confused
with
the
testimony
of
the
midshipman
so
much
at
variance
with
the
language
and
behaviour
of
the
captain
when
i
arrived
at
the
blue
posts
i
found
all
the
midshipmen
in
the
and
i
repeated
to
them
all
that
had
passed
when
i
had
finished
they
burst
out
laughing
and
said
that
they
had
only
been
joking
with
me
well
said
i
to
the
one
who
had
called
me
up
in
the
morning
you
may
call
it
joking
but
i
call
it
lying
pray
mr
bottlegreen
do
you
refer
to
me
yes
i
do
replied
i
then
sir
as
a
gentleman
i
demand
satisfaction
slugs
in
a
death
before
dishonour
d
e
i
shall
not
refuse
you
replied
i
although
i
had
rather
not
fight
a
duel
my
father
cautioned
me
on
the
subject
desiring
me
if
possible
to
avoid
it
as
it
was
flying
in
the
face
of
my
creator
but
aware
that
i
must
uphold
my
character
as
an
officer
he
left
me
to
my
own
discretion
should
i
ever
be
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
in
such
a
dilemma
well
we
do
want
one
of
your
father
sermons
at
replied
the
midshipman
for
i
had
told
them
that
my
father
was
a
clergyman
the
plain
question
is
will
you
fight
or
will
you
not
could
not
the
affair
be
arranged
otherwise
interrupted
another
will
not
mr
bottlegreen
retract
my
name
is
simple
sir
and
not
bottlegreen
replied
i
and
as
he
did
tell
a
falsehood
i
will
not
retract
then
the
affair
must
go
on
said
the
midshipman
robinson
will
you
oblige
me
by
acting
as
my
second
it
an
unpleasant
business
replied
the
other
you
are
so
good
a
shot
but
as
you
request
it
i
shall
not
refuse
mr
simple
is
not
i
believe
provided
with
a
friend
yes
he
is
replied
another
of
the
midshipmen
he
is
a
spunky
fellow
and
i
be
his
second
it
was
then
arranged
that
we
should
meet
the
next
morning
with
pistols
i
considered
that
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
i
could
not
well
refuse
but
i
was
very
unhappy
not
three
days
left
to
my
own
guidance
and
i
had
become
intoxicated
and
was
now
to
fight
a
duel
i
went
up
into
my
room
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
my
mother
enclosing
a
lock
of
my
hair
and
having
shed
a
few
tears
at
the
idea
of
how
sorry
she
would
be
if
i
were
killed
i
borrowed
a
bible
from
the
waiter
and
read
it
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
chapter
iv
i
am
taught
on
a
cold
morning
before
breakfast
how
to
stand
fire
and
thus
prove
my
courage
after
breakfast
i
also
prove
my
gallantry
my
proof
meets
reproof
woman
at
the
bottom
of
all
mischief
by
one
i
lose
my
liberty
and
by
another
my
money
when
i
began
to
wake
the
next
morning
i
could
not
think
what
it
was
that
felt
like
a
weight
upon
my
chest
but
as
i
roused
and
recalled
my
scattered
thoughts
i
remembered
that
in
an
hour
or
two
it
would
be
decided
whether
i
were
to
exist
another
day
i
prayed
fervently
and
made
a
resolution
in
my
own
mind
that
i
would
not
have
the
blood
of
another
upon
my
conscience
and
would
fire
my
pistol
up
in
the
air
and
after
i
had
made
that
resolution
i
no
longer
felt
the
alarm
which
i
did
before
before
i
was
dressed
the
midshipman
who
had
volunteered
to
be
my
second
came
into
my
room
and
informed
me
that
the
affair
was
to
be
decided
in
the
garden
behind
the
inn
that
my
adversary
was
a
very
good
shot
and
that
i
must
expect
to
be
winged
if
not
drilled
and
what
is
winged
and
drilled
inquired
i
i
have
not
only
never
fought
a
duel
but
i
have
not
even
fired
a
pistol
in
my
life
he
explained
what
he
meant
which
was
that
being
winged
implied
being
shot
through
the
arm
or
leg
whereas
being
drilled
was
to
be
shot
through
the
body
but
continued
he
is
it
possible
that
you
have
never
fought
a
duel
no
replied
i
i
am
not
yet
fifteen
years
old
not
fifteen
why
i
thought
you
were
eighteen
at
the
least
but
i
was
very
tall
and
stout
for
my
age
and
people
generally
thought
me
older
than
i
actually
was
i
dressed
myself
and
followed
my
second
into
the
garden
where
i
found
all
the
midshipmen
and
some
of
the
waiters
of
the
inn
they
all
seemed
very
merry
as
if
the
life
of
a
was
of
no
consequence
the
seconds
talked
apart
for
a
little
while
and
then
measured
the
ground
which
was
twelve
paces
we
then
took
our
stations
i
believe
that
i
turned
pale
for
my
second
came
to
my
side
and
whispered
that
i
must
not
be
frightened
i
replied
that
i
was
not
frightened
but
that
i
considered
that
it
was
an
awful
moment
the
second
to
my
adversary
then
came
up
and
asked
me
whether
i
would
make
an
apology
which
i
refused
to
do
as
before
they
handed
a
pistol
to
each
of
us
and
my
second
showed
me
how
i
was
to
pull
the
trigger
it
was
arranged
that
at
the
word
given
we
were
to
fire
at
the
same
time
i
made
sure
that
i
should
be
wounded
if
not
killed
and
i
shut
my
eyes
as
i
fired
my
pistol
in
the
air
i
felt
my
head
swim
and
thought
i
was
hurt
but
fortunately
i
was
not
the
pistols
were
loaded
again
and
we
fired
a
second
time
the
seconds
then
interfered
and
it
was
proposed
that
we
should
shake
hands
which
i
was
very
glad
to
do
for
i
considered
my
life
to
have
been
saved
by
a
miracle
we
all
went
back
to
the
and
sat
down
to
breakfast
they
then
told
me
that
they
all
belonged
to
the
same
ship
that
i
did
and
that
they
were
glad
to
see
that
i
could
stand
fire
for
the
captain
was
a
terrible
fellow
for
and
running
under
the
enemy
batteries
the
next
day
my
chest
arrived
by
the
waggon
and
i
threw
off
my
and
put
on
my
uniform
i
had
no
cocked
hat
or
dirk
as
the
warehouse
people
employed
by
mr
handycock
did
not
supply
those
articles
and
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
procure
them
at
portsmouth
when
i
inquired
the
price
i
found
that
they
cost
more
money
than
i
had
in
my
pocket
so
i
tore
up
the
letter
i
had
written
to
my
mother
before
the
duel
and
wrote
another
asking
for
a
remittance
to
purchase
my
dirk
and
cocked
hat
i
then
walked
out
in
my
uniform
not
a
little
proud
i
must
confess
i
was
now
an
officer
in
his
majesty
service
not
very
high
in
rank
certainly
but
still
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
and
i
made
a
vow
that
i
would
support
the
character
although
i
was
considered
the
greatest
fool
of
the
family
i
had
arrived
opposite
a
place
called
sally
port
when
a
young
lady
very
nicely
dressed
looked
at
me
very
hard
and
said
well
reefer
how
are
you
off
for
soap
i
was
astonished
at
the
question
and
more
so
at
the
interest
which
she
seemed
to
take
in
my
affairs
i
answered
thank
you
i
am
very
well
off
i
have
four
cakes
of
windsor
and
two
bars
of
yellow
for
washing
she
laughed
at
my
reply
and
asked
me
whether
i
would
walk
home
and
take
a
bit
of
dinner
with
her
i
was
astonished
at
this
polite
offer
which
my
modesty
induced
me
to
ascribe
more
to
my
uniform
than
to
my
own
merits
and
as
i
felt
no
inclination
to
refuse
the
compliment
i
said
that
i
should
be
most
happy
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
offer
my
arm
which
she
accepted
and
we
proceeded
up
high
street
on
our
way
to
her
home
just
as
we
passed
the
admiral
house
i
perceived
my
captain
walking
with
two
of
the
admiral
daughters
i
was
not
a
little
proud
to
let
him
see
that
i
had
female
acquaintances
as
well
as
he
had
and
as
i
passed
him
with
the
young
lady
under
my
protection
i
took
off
my
hat
and
made
him
a
low
bow
to
my
surprise
not
only
did
he
not
return
the
salute
but
he
looked
at
me
with
a
very
stern
countenance
i
concluded
that
he
was
a
very
proud
man
and
did
not
wish
the
admiral
daughters
to
suppose
that
he
knew
midshipmen
by
sight
but
i
had
not
exactly
made
up
my
mind
on
the
subject
when
the
captain
having
seen
the
ladies
into
the
admiral
house
sent
one
of
the
messengers
after
me
to
desire
that
i
would
immediately
come
to
him
at
the
george
inn
which
was
nearly
opposite
i
apologised
to
the
young
lady
and
promised
to
return
immediately
if
she
would
wait
for
me
but
she
replied
if
that
was
my
captain
it
was
her
idea
that
i
should
have
a
confounded
wigging
and
be
sent
on
board
so
wishing
me
she
left
me
and
continued
her
way
home
i
could
as
little
comprehend
all
this
as
why
the
captain
looked
so
black
when
i
passed
him
but
it
was
soon
explained
when
i
went
up
to
him
in
the
parlour
at
the
george
inn
i
am
sorry
mr
simple
said
the
captain
when
i
entered
that
a
lad
like
you
should
show
such
early
symptoms
of
depravity
still
more
so
that
he
should
not
have
the
grace
which
even
the
most
hardened
are
not
wholly
destitute
of
i
mean
to
practise
immorality
in
secret
and
not
degrade
themselves
and
insult
their
captain
by
unblushingly
avowing
i
may
say
glorying
in
their
iniquity
by
exposing
it
in
broad
day
and
in
the
most
frequented
street
of
the
town
sir
replied
i
with
astonishment
o
dear
o
dear
what
have
i
done
the
captain
fixed
his
keen
eyes
upon
me
so
that
they
appeared
to
pierce
me
through
and
nail
me
to
the
wall
do
you
pretend
to
say
sir
that
you
were
not
aware
of
the
character
of
the
person
with
whom
you
were
walking
just
now
no
sir
replied
i
except
that
she
was
very
kind
and
and
then
i
told
him
how
she
had
addressed
me
and
what
subsequently
took
place
and
is
it
possible
mr
simple
that
you
are
so
great
a
fool
i
replied
that
i
certainly
was
considered
the
greatest
fool
of
our
family
i
should
think
you
were
replied
he
drily
he
then
explained
to
me
who
the
person
was
with
whom
i
was
in
company
and
how
any
association
with
her
would
inevitably
lead
to
my
ruin
and
disgrace
i
cried
very
much
for
i
was
shocked
at
the
narrow
escape
which
i
had
had
and
mortified
at
having
fallen
in
his
good
opinion
he
asked
me
how
i
had
employed
my
time
since
i
had
been
at
portsmouth
and
i
made
an
acknowledgment
of
having
been
made
tipsy
related
all
that
the
midshipmen
had
told
me
and
how
i
had
that
morning
fought
a
duel
he
listened
to
my
whole
story
very
attentively
and
i
thought
that
occasionally
there
was
a
smile
upon
his
face
although
he
bit
his
lips
to
prevent
it
when
i
had
finished
he
said
mr
simple
i
can
no
longer
trust
you
on
shore
until
you
are
more
experienced
in
the
world
i
shall
desire
my
coxswain
not
to
lose
sight
of
you
until
you
are
safe
on
board
of
the
frigate
when
you
have
sailed
a
few
months
with
me
you
will
then
be
able
to
decide
whether
i
deserve
the
character
which
the
young
gentlemen
have
painted
with
i
must
say
i
believe
the
sole
intention
of
practising
upon
your
inexperience
altogether
i
did
not
feel
sorry
when
it
was
over
i
saw
that
the
captain
believed
what
i
had
stated
and
that
he
was
disposed
to
be
kind
to
me
although
he
thought
me
very
silly
the
coxswain
in
obedience
to
his
orders
accompanied
me
to
the
blue
posts
i
packed
up
my
clothes
paid
my
bill
and
the
porter
wheeled
my
chest
down
to
the
sally
port
where
the
boat
was
waiting
come
heave
my
lads
be
smart
the
captain
says
we
are
to
take
the
young
gentleman
on
board
directly
his
liberty
stopped
for
getting
drunk
and
running
after
the
dolly
mops
i
should
thank
you
to
be
more
respectful
in
your
remarks
mr
coxswain
said
i
with
displeasure
mister
coxswain
thanky
sir
for
giving
me
a
handle
to
my
name
replied
he
come
be
smart
with
your
oars
my
lads
la
bill
freeman
said
a
young
woman
on
the
beach
what
a
nice
young
gentleman
you
have
there
he
looks
like
a
sucking
nelson
i
say
my
pretty
young
officer
could
you
lend
me
a
shilling
i
was
so
pleased
at
the
woman
calling
me
a
young
nelson
that
i
immediately
complied
with
her
request
i
have
not
a
shilling
in
my
pocket
said
i
but
here
is
and
you
can
change
it
and
bring
me
back
the
eighteen
pence
well
you
are
a
nice
young
man
replied
she
taking
the
i
be
back
directly
my
dear
the
men
in
the
boat
laughed
and
the
coxswain
desired
them
to
shove
off
no
observed
i
you
must
wait
for
my
eighteen
pence
we
shall
wait
a
devilish
long
while
then
i
suspect
i
know
that
girl
and
she
has
a
very
bad
memory
she
can
not
be
so
dishonest
or
ungrateful
replied
i
coxswain
i
order
you
to
stay
i
am
an
officer
i
know
you
are
sir
about
six
hours
old
well
then
i
must
go
up
and
tell
the
captain
that
you
have
another
girl
in
tow
and
that
you
go
on
board
oh
no
mr
coxswain
pray
do
shove
off
as
soon
as
you
please
and
never
mind
the
eighteen
pence
the
boat
then
shoved
off
and
pulled
towards
the
ship
which
lay
at
spithead
chapter
v
i
am
introduced
to
the
and
first
lieutenant
who
pronounces
me
very
clever
trotted
below
to
mrs
trotter
connubial
bliss
in
a
mr
trotter
takes
me
in
as
a
feel
very
much
surprised
that
so
many
people
know
that
i
am
the
son
of
my
father
on
our
arrival
on
board
the
coxswain
gave
a
note
from
the
captain
to
the
first
lieutenant
who
happened
to
be
on
deck
he
read
the
note
looked
at
me
earnestly
and
then
i
overheard
him
say
to
another
lieutenant
the
service
is
going
to
the
devil
as
long
as
it
was
not
popular
if
we
had
not
much
education
we
at
least
had
the
chance
that
natural
abilities
gave
us
but
now
that
great
people
send
their
sons
for
a
provision
into
the
navy
we
have
all
the
refuse
of
their
families
as
if
anything
was
good
enough
to
make
a
captain
of
a
who
has
occasionally
more
responsibility
on
his
shoulders
and
is
placed
in
situations
requiring
more
judgment
than
any
other
people
in
existence
here
another
of
the
fools
of
a
family
made
a
present
of
to
the
country
another
cub
for
me
to
lick
into
shape
well
i
never
saw
the
one
yet
i
did
not
make
something
of
where
mr
simple
i
am
mr
simple
sir
replied
i
very
much
frightened
at
what
i
had
overheard
now
mr
simple
said
the
first
lieutenant
observe
and
pay
particular
attention
to
what
i
say
the
captain
tells
me
in
this
note
that
you
have
been
shamming
stupid
now
sir
i
am
not
to
be
taken
in
that
way
you
something
like
the
monkeys
who
wo
speak
because
they
are
afraid
they
will
be
made
to
work
i
have
looked
attentively
at
your
face
and
i
see
at
once
that
you
are
and
if
you
do
not
prove
so
in
a
very
short
time
why
you
had
better
jump
overboard
that
all
perfectly
understand
me
i
know
that
you
are
a
very
clever
fellow
and
having
told
you
so
do
you
pretend
to
impose
upon
me
for
it
wo
do
i
was
very
much
terrified
at
this
speech
but
at
the
same
time
i
was
pleased
to
hear
that
he
thought
me
clever
and
i
determined
to
do
all
in
my
power
to
keep
up
such
an
unexpected
reputation
said
the
first
lieutenant
tell
mr
trotter
to
come
on
deck
the
brought
up
mr
trotter
who
apologized
for
being
so
dirty
as
he
was
breaking
casks
out
of
the
hold
he
was
a
short
man
about
thirty
years
of
age
with
a
nose
which
had
a
red
club
to
it
very
dirty
teeth
and
large
black
whiskers
mr
trotter
said
the
first
lieutenant
here
is
a
young
gentleman
who
has
joined
the
ship
introduce
him
into
the
berth
and
see
his
hammock
slung
you
must
look
after
him
a
little
i
really
have
very
little
time
to
look
after
any
of
them
sir
replied
mr
trotter
but
i
will
do
what
i
can
follow
me
youngster
accordingly
i
descended
the
ladder
after
him
then
i
went
down
another
and
then
to
my
surprise
i
was
desired
by
him
to
go
down
a
third
which
when
i
had
done
he
informed
me
that
i
was
in
the
now
youngster
said
mr
trotter
seating
himself
upon
a
large
chest
you
may
do
as
you
please
the
midshipmen
mess
is
on
the
deck
above
this
and
if
you
like
to
join
why
you
can
but
this
i
will
tell
you
as
a
friend
that
you
will
be
thrashed
all
day
long
and
fare
very
badly
the
weakest
always
goes
to
the
wall
there
but
perhaps
you
do
not
mind
that
now
that
we
are
in
harbour
i
mess
here
because
mrs
trotter
is
on
board
she
is
a
very
charming
woman
i
can
assure
you
and
will
be
here
directly
she
has
just
gone
up
into
the
galley
to
look
after
a
net
of
potatoes
in
the
copper
if
you
like
it
better
i
will
ask
her
permission
for
you
to
mess
with
us
you
will
then
be
away
from
the
midshipmen
who
are
a
sad
set
and
will
teach
you
nothing
but
what
is
immoral
and
improper
and
you
will
have
the
advantage
of
being
in
good
society
for
mrs
trotter
has
kept
the
very
best
in
england
i
make
you
this
offer
because
i
want
to
oblige
the
first
lieutenant
who
appears
to
take
an
interest
about
you
otherwise
i
am
not
very
fond
of
having
any
intrusion
upon
my
domestic
happiness
i
replied
that
i
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
kindness
and
that
if
it
would
not
put
mrs
trotter
to
an
inconvenience
i
should
be
happy
to
accept
of
his
offer
indeed
i
thought
myself
very
fortunate
in
having
met
with
such
a
friend
i
had
scarcely
time
to
reply
when
i
perceived
a
pair
of
legs
cased
in
black
cotton
stockings
on
the
ladder
above
us
and
it
proved
that
they
belonged
to
mrs
trotter
who
came
down
the
ladder
with
a
net
full
of
smoking
potatoes
upon
my
word
mrs
trotter
you
must
be
conscious
of
having
a
very
pretty
ankle
or
you
would
not
venture
to
display
it
as
you
have
to
mr
simple
a
young
gentleman
whom
i
beg
to
introduce
to
you
and
who
with
your
permission
will
join
our
mess
my
dear
trotter
how
cruel
of
you
not
to
give
me
warning
i
thought
that
nobody
was
below
i
declare
i
so
ashamed
continued
the
lady
simpering
and
covering
her
face
with
the
hand
which
was
unemployed
it
ca
be
helped
now
my
love
neither
was
there
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
i
trust
mr
simple
and
you
will
be
very
good
friends
i
believe
i
mentioned
his
desire
to
join
our
mess
i
am
sure
i
shall
be
very
happy
in
his
company
this
is
a
strange
place
for
me
to
live
in
mr
simple
after
the
society
to
which
i
have
been
accustomed
but
affection
can
make
any
sacrifice
and
rather
than
lose
the
company
of
my
dear
trotter
who
has
been
unfortunate
in
pecuniary
matters
say
no
more
about
it
my
love
domestic
happiness
is
everything
and
will
enliven
even
the
gloom
of
a
and
yet
continued
mrs
trotter
when
i
think
of
the
time
when
we
used
to
live
in
london
and
keep
our
carriage
have
you
ever
been
in
london
mr
simple
i
answered
that
i
had
then
probably
you
may
have
been
acquainted
with
or
have
heard
of
the
smiths
i
replied
that
the
only
people
that
i
knew
there
were
a
mr
and
mrs
handycock
well
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
in
london
i
should
have
been
very
glad
to
have
given
you
a
letter
of
introduction
to
the
smiths
they
are
quite
the
topping
people
of
the
place
but
my
dear
interrupted
mr
trotter
is
it
not
time
to
look
after
our
dinner
yes
i
am
going
forward
for
it
now
we
have
skewer
pieces
mr
simple
will
you
excuse
me
and
then
with
a
great
deal
of
flirtation
and
laughing
about
her
ankles
and
requesting
me
as
a
favour
to
turn
my
face
away
mrs
trotter
ascended
the
ladder
as
the
reader
may
wish
to
know
what
sort
of
looking
personage
she
was
i
will
take
this
opportunity
to
describe
her
her
figure
was
very
good
and
at
one
period
of
her
life
i
thought
her
face
must
have
been
very
handsome
at
the
time
i
was
introduced
to
her
it
showed
the
ravages
of
time
or
hardship
very
distinctly
in
short
she
might
be
termed
a
faded
beauty
flaunting
in
her
dress
and
not
very
clean
in
her
person
charming
woman
mrs
trotter
is
she
not
mr
simple
said
the
mate
to
which
of
course
i
immediately
acquiesced
now
mr
simple
continued
he
there
are
a
few
arrangements
which
i
had
better
mention
while
mrs
trotter
is
away
for
she
would
be
shocked
at
our
talking
about
such
things
of
course
the
style
of
living
which
we
indulge
in
is
rather
expensive
mrs
trotter
can
not
dispense
with
her
tea
and
her
other
little
comforts
at
the
same
time
i
must
put
you
to
no
extra
expense
i
had
rather
be
out
of
pocket
myself
i
propose
that
during
the
time
you
mess
with
us
you
shall
only
pay
one
guinea
per
week
and
as
for
entrance
money
why
i
think
i
must
not
charge
you
more
than
a
couple
of
guineas
have
you
any
money
yes
i
replied
i
have
three
guineas
and
a
half
left
well
then
give
me
the
three
guineas
and
the
you
can
reserve
for
you
must
write
to
your
friends
immediately
for
a
further
supply
i
handed
him
the
money
which
he
put
in
his
pocket
your
chest
continued
he
you
shall
bring
down
here
for
mrs
trotter
will
i
am
sure
if
i
request
it
not
only
keep
it
in
order
for
you
but
see
that
your
clothes
are
properly
mended
she
is
a
charming
woman
mrs
trotter
and
very
fond
of
young
gentlemen
how
old
are
you
i
replied
that
i
was
fifteen
no
more
well
i
am
glad
of
that
for
mrs
trotter
is
very
particular
after
a
certain
age
i
should
recommend
you
on
no
account
to
associate
with
the
other
midshipmen
they
are
very
angry
with
me
because
i
would
not
permit
mrs
trotter
to
join
their
mess
and
they
are
sad
that
they
certainly
are
replied
i
but
here
we
were
interrupted
by
mrs
trotter
coming
down
with
a
piece
of
stick
in
her
hand
upon
which
were
skewered
about
a
dozen
small
pieces
of
beef
and
pork
which
she
first
laid
on
a
plate
and
then
began
to
lay
the
cloth
and
prepare
for
dinner
mr
simple
is
only
fifteen
my
dear
observed
mr
trotter
dear
me
replied
mrs
trotter
why
how
tall
he
is
he
is
quite
as
tall
for
his
age
as
young
lord
foutretown
whom
you
used
to
take
out
with
you
in
the
do
you
know
lord
foutretown
mr
simple
no
i
do
not
replied
i
but
wishing
to
let
them
know
that
i
was
well
connected
i
continued
but
i
dare
say
that
my
grandfather
lord
privilege
does
god
bless
me
is
lord
privilege
your
grandfather
well
i
thought
i
saw
a
likeness
somewhere
do
you
recollect
lord
privilege
my
dear
trotter
that
we
met
at
lady
scamp
an
elderly
person
it
very
ungrateful
of
you
not
to
recollect
him
for
he
sent
you
a
very
fine
haunch
of
venison
privilege
bless
me
yes
oh
yes
an
old
gentleman
is
he
not
said
mr
trotter
appealing
to
me
yes
sir
replied
i
quite
delighted
to
find
myself
among
those
who
were
acquainted
with
my
family
well
then
mr
simple
said
mrs
trotter
since
we
have
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
your
family
i
shall
now
take
you
under
my
own
charge
and
i
shall
be
so
fond
of
you
that
trotter
shall
become
quite
jealous
added
she
laughing
we
have
but
a
poor
dinner
for
the
bumboat
woman
disappointed
me
i
particularly
requested
her
to
bring
me
off
a
leg
of
lamb
but
she
says
that
there
was
none
in
the
market
it
is
rather
early
for
it
that
true
but
trotter
is
very
nice
in
his
eating
now
let
us
sit
down
to
dinner
i
felt
very
sick
indeed
and
could
eat
nothing
our
dinner
consisted
of
the
pieces
of
beef
and
pork
the
potatoes
and
a
baked
pudding
in
a
tin
dish
mr
trotter
went
up
to
serve
the
spirits
out
to
the
ship
company
and
returned
with
a
bottle
of
rum
have
you
got
mr
simple
allowance
my
love
inquired
mrs
trotter
yes
he
is
victualled
as
he
came
on
board
before
twelve
do
you
drink
spirits
mr
simple
no
i
thank
you
replied
i
for
i
remembered
the
captain
injunction
taking
as
i
do
such
an
interest
in
your
welfare
i
must
earnestly
recommend
you
to
abstain
from
them
said
mr
trotter
it
is
a
very
bad
habit
and
once
acquired
not
easy
to
be
left
off
i
am
obliged
to
drink
them
that
i
may
not
check
the
perspiration
after
working
in
the
hold
i
have
nevertheless
a
natural
abhorrence
of
them
but
my
champagne
and
claret
days
are
gone
by
and
i
must
submit
to
circumstances
my
poor
trotter
said
the
lady
well
continued
he
it
a
poor
heart
that
never
rejoiceth
he
then
poured
out
half
a
tumbler
of
rum
and
filled
the
glass
up
with
water
my
love
will
you
taste
it
now
trotter
you
know
that
i
never
touch
it
except
when
the
water
is
so
bad
that
i
must
have
the
taste
taken
away
how
is
the
water
as
usual
my
dear
not
drinkable
after
much
persuasion
mrs
trotter
agreed
to
sip
a
little
out
of
his
glass
i
thought
that
she
took
it
pretty
often
considering
that
she
did
not
like
it
but
i
felt
so
unwell
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
on
the
there
i
was
met
by
a
midshipman
whom
i
had
not
seen
before
he
looked
very
earnestly
in
my
face
and
then
asked
my
name
simple
said
he
what
are
you
the
son
of
old
simple
yes
sir
replied
i
astonished
that
so
many
should
know
my
family
well
i
thought
so
by
the
likeness
and
how
is
your
father
very
well
i
thank
you
sir
when
you
write
to
him
make
my
compliments
and
tell
him
that
i
desired
to
be
particularly
remembered
to
him
and
he
walked
forward
but
as
he
forgot
to
mention
his
own
name
i
could
not
do
it
i
went
to
bed
very
tired
mr
trotter
had
my
hammock
hung
up
in
the
separated
by
a
from
the
cot
in
which
he
slept
with
his
wife
i
thought
this
very
odd
but
they
told
me
it
was
the
general
custom
on
board
ship
although
mrs
trotter
delicacy
was
very
much
shocked
by
it
i
was
very
sick
but
mrs
trotter
was
very
kind
when
i
was
in
bed
she
kissed
me
and
wished
me
good
night
and
very
soon
afterwards
i
fell
fast
asleep
chapter
vi
puzzled
with
very
common
words
mrs
trotter
takes
care
of
my
wardrobe
a
matrimonial
duet
ending
i
awoke
the
next
morning
at
daylight
with
a
noise
over
my
head
which
sounded
like
thunder
i
found
it
proceeded
from
holystoning
and
washing
down
the
i
was
very
much
refreshed
nevertheless
and
did
not
feel
the
least
sick
or
giddy
mr
trotter
who
had
been
up
at
four
came
down
and
directed
one
of
the
marines
to
fetch
me
some
water
i
washed
myself
on
my
chest
and
then
went
on
the
which
they
were
swabbing
dry
standing
by
the
sentry
at
the
i
met
one
of
the
midshipmen
with
whom
i
had
been
in
company
at
the
blue
posts
so
master
simple
old
trotter
and
his
faggot
of
a
wife
have
got
hold
of
you
have
they
said
he
i
replied
that
i
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
faggot
but
that
i
considered
mrs
trotter
a
very
charming
woman
at
which
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
well
said
he
i
just
give
you
a
caution
take
care
or
they
make
a
clean
sweep
has
mrs
trotter
shown
you
her
ankle
yet
yes
i
replied
and
a
very
pretty
one
it
is
ah
she
at
her
old
tricks
you
had
much
better
have
joined
our
mess
at
once
you
not
the
first
greenhorn
that
they
have
plucked
well
said
he
as
he
walked
away
keep
the
key
of
your
own
chest
all
but
as
mr
trotter
had
warned
me
that
the
midshipmen
would
abuse
them
i
paid
very
little
attention
to
what
he
said
when
he
left
me
i
went
on
the
all
the
sailors
were
busy
at
work
and
the
first
lieutenant
cried
out
to
the
gunner
now
mr
dispart
if
you
are
ready
we
breech
these
guns
now
my
lads
said
the
first
lieutenant
we
must
slue
the
part
that
breeches
cover
more
forward
as
i
never
heard
of
a
gun
having
breeches
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
went
up
close
to
the
first
lieutenant
who
said
to
me
youngster
hand
me
that
i
saw
nothing
like
a
but
i
was
so
frightened
that
i
snatched
up
the
first
thing
that
i
saw
which
was
a
short
bar
of
iron
and
it
so
happened
that
it
was
the
very
article
which
he
wanted
when
i
gave
it
to
him
the
first
lieutenant
looked
at
me
and
said
so
you
know
what
a
monkey
tail
is
already
do
you
now
you
ever
sham
stupid
after
that
thought
i
to
myself
i
very
lucky
but
if
that
a
monkey
tail
a
very
stiff
one
i
resolved
to
learn
the
names
of
everything
as
fast
as
i
could
that
i
might
be
prepared
so
i
listened
attentively
to
what
was
said
but
i
soon
became
quite
confused
and
despaired
of
remembering
anything
how
is
this
to
be
finished
off
sir
inquired
a
sailor
of
the
boatswain
why
i
beg
leave
to
hint
to
you
sir
in
the
most
delicate
manner
in
the
world
replied
the
boatswain
that
it
must
be
with
a
and
be
d
d
to
you
do
you
know
that
yet
captain
of
the
foretop
said
he
up
on
your
and
take
your
up
three
inches
ay
ay
sir
i
looked
and
looked
but
i
could
see
no
horses
mr
chucks
said
the
first
lieutenant
to
the
boatswain
what
blocks
have
we
below
not
on
charge
let
me
see
sir
i
one
we
split
in
half
the
other
day
and
i
think
i
have
a
couple
of
down
in
the
i
say
you
smith
pass
that
brace
through
the
eye
and
take
the
out
before
you
come
down
and
then
he
asked
the
first
lieutenant
whether
something
should
not
be
fitted
with
a
or
only
a
told
him
the
must
be
spread
out
by
the
armourer
as
soon
as
the
forge
was
up
in
short
what
with
and
and
and
and
i
was
so
puzzled
with
what
i
heard
that
i
was
about
to
leave
the
deck
in
absolute
despair
and
mr
chucks
recollect
this
afternoon
that
you
all
the
bleed
the
boys
thought
i
what
can
that
be
for
at
all
events
the
surgeon
appears
to
be
the
proper
person
to
perform
that
operation
this
last
incomprehensible
remark
drove
me
off
the
deck
and
i
retreated
to
the
where
i
found
mrs
trotter
oh
my
dear
said
she
i
am
glad
you
are
come
as
i
wish
to
put
your
clothes
in
order
have
you
a
list
of
them
where
is
your
key
i
replied
that
i
had
not
a
list
and
i
handed
her
the
key
although
i
did
not
forget
the
caution
of
the
midshipman
yet
i
considered
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
her
looking
over
my
clothes
when
i
was
present
she
unlocked
my
chest
and
pulled
everything
out
and
then
commenced
telling
me
what
were
likely
to
be
useful
and
what
were
not
now
these
worsted
stockings
she
said
will
be
very
comfortable
in
cold
weather
and
in
the
summer
time
these
brown
cotton
socks
will
be
delightfully
cool
and
you
have
enough
of
each
to
last
you
till
you
outgrow
them
but
as
for
these
fine
cotton
stockings
they
are
of
no
use
only
catch
the
dirt
when
the
decks
are
swept
and
always
look
untidy
i
wonder
how
they
could
be
so
foolish
as
to
send
them
nobody
wears
them
on
board
ship
nowadays
they
are
only
fit
for
women
i
wonder
if
they
would
fit
me
she
turned
her
chair
away
and
put
on
one
of
my
stockings
laughing
the
whole
of
the
time
then
she
turned
round
to
me
and
showed
me
how
nicely
they
fitted
her
bless
you
mr
simple
it
well
that
trotter
is
in
the
hold
he
be
so
jealous
do
you
know
what
these
stockings
cost
they
are
of
no
use
to
you
and
they
fit
me
i
will
speak
to
trotter
and
take
them
off
your
hands
i
replied
that
i
could
not
think
of
selling
them
and
as
they
were
of
no
use
to
me
and
fitted
her
i
begged
that
she
would
accept
of
the
dozen
pairs
at
first
she
positively
refused
but
as
i
pressed
her
she
at
last
consented
and
i
was
very
happy
to
give
them
to
her
as
she
was
very
kind
to
me
and
i
thought
with
her
husband
that
she
was
a
very
charming
woman
we
had
and
onions
for
dinner
that
day
but
i
could
not
bear
the
smell
of
the
onions
mr
trotter
came
down
very
cross
because
the
first
lieutenant
had
found
fault
with
him
he
swore
that
he
would
cut
the
service
that
he
had
only
remained
to
oblige
the
captain
who
said
that
he
would
sooner
part
with
his
right
arm
and
that
he
would
demand
satisfaction
of
the
first
lieutenant
as
soon
as
he
could
obtain
his
discharge
mrs
trotter
did
all
she
could
to
pacify
him
reminded
him
that
he
had
the
protection
of
lord
this
and
sir
thomas
that
who
would
see
him
righted
but
in
vain
the
first
lieutenant
had
told
him
he
said
that
he
was
not
worth
his
salt
and
blood
only
could
wipe
away
the
insult
he
drank
glass
of
grog
after
glass
of
grog
and
at
each
glass
became
more
violent
and
mrs
trotter
drank
also
i
observed
a
great
deal
more
than
i
thought
she
ought
to
have
done
but
she
whispered
to
me
that
she
drank
it
that
trotter
might
not
as
he
would
certainly
be
tipsy
i
thought
this
very
devoted
on
her
part
but
they
sat
so
late
that
i
went
to
bed
and
left
them
he
still
drinking
and
vowing
vengeance
against
the
first
lieutenant
i
had
not
been
asleep
above
two
or
three
hours
when
i
was
awakened
by
a
great
noise
and
quarrelling
and
i
discovered
that
mr
trotter
was
drunk
and
beating
his
wife
very
much
shocked
that
such
a
charming
woman
should
be
beaten
and
i
scrambled
out
of
my
hammock
to
see
if
i
could
be
of
any
assistance
but
it
was
dark
although
they
scuffled
as
much
as
before
i
asked
the
marine
who
was
sentry
at
the
door
above
to
bring
his
lantern
and
was
very
much
shocked
at
his
replying
that
i
had
better
go
to
bed
and
let
them
fight
it
out
shortly
afterwards
mrs
trotter
who
had
not
taken
off
her
clothes
came
from
behind
the
screen
i
perceived
at
once
that
the
poor
woman
could
hardly
stand
she
reeled
to
my
chest
where
she
sat
down
and
cried
i
pulled
on
my
clothes
as
fast
as
i
could
and
then
went
up
to
her
to
console
her
but
she
could
not
speak
intelligibly
after
attempting
in
vain
to
comfort
her
she
made
me
no
answer
but
staggered
to
my
hammock
and
after
several
attempts
succeeded
in
getting
into
it
i
can
not
say
that
i
much
liked
that
but
what
could
i
do
so
i
finished
dressing
myself
and
went
up
on
the
the
midshipman
who
had
the
watch
was
the
one
who
had
cautioned
me
against
the
trotters
he
was
very
friendly
to
me
well
simple
said
he
what
brings
you
on
deck
i
told
him
how
ill
mr
trotter
had
behaved
to
his
wife
and
how
she
had
turned
into
my
hammock
the
cursed
drunken
old
catamaran
cried
he
i
go
and
cut
her
down
by
the
head
but
i
requested
he
would
not
as
she
was
a
lady
a
lady
replied
he
yes
there
plenty
of
ladies
of
her
description
and
then
he
informed
me
that
she
had
many
years
ago
been
the
mistress
of
a
man
of
fortune
who
kept
a
carriage
for
her
but
that
he
grew
tired
of
her
and
had
given
trotter
to
marry
her
and
that
now
they
did
nothing
but
get
drunk
together
and
fight
with
each
other
i
was
very
much
annoyed
to
hear
all
this
but
as
i
perceived
that
mrs
trotter
was
not
sober
i
began
to
think
that
what
the
midshipman
said
was
true
i
hope
added
he
that
she
has
not
had
time
to
wheedle
you
out
of
any
of
your
clothes
i
told
him
that
i
had
given
her
a
dozen
pairs
of
stockings
and
had
paid
mr
trotter
three
guineas
for
my
mess
this
must
be
looked
to
replied
he
i
shall
speak
to
the
first
lieutenant
in
the
mean
time
i
shall
get
your
hammock
for
you
keep
a
good
he
then
went
below
and
i
followed
him
to
see
what
he
would
do
he
went
to
my
hammock
and
lowered
it
down
at
one
end
so
that
mrs
trotter
lay
with
her
head
on
the
deck
in
a
very
uncomfortable
position
to
my
astonishment
she
swore
at
him
in
a
dreadful
manner
but
refused
to
turn
out
he
was
abusing
her
and
shaking
her
in
the
hammock
when
mr
trotter
who
had
been
roused
at
the
noise
rushed
from
behind
the
screen
you
villain
what
are
you
doing
with
my
wife
cried
he
pommelling
at
him
as
well
as
he
could
for
he
was
so
tipsy
that
he
could
hardly
stand
i
thought
the
midshipman
able
to
take
care
of
himself
and
did
not
wish
to
interfere
so
i
remained
above
looking
on
the
sentry
standing
by
me
with
his
lantern
over
the
coombings
of
the
hatchway
to
give
light
to
the
midshipman
and
to
witness
the
fray
mr
trotter
was
soon
knocked
down
when
all
of
a
sudden
mrs
trotter
jumped
up
from
the
hammock
and
caught
the
midshipman
by
the
hair
and
pulled
at
him
then
the
sentry
thought
right
to
interfere
he
called
out
for
the
and
went
down
himself
to
help
the
midshipman
who
was
faring
badly
between
the
two
but
mrs
trotter
snatched
the
lantern
out
of
his
hand
and
smashed
it
all
to
pieces
and
then
we
were
all
left
in
darkness
and
i
could
not
see
what
took
place
although
the
scuffling
continued
such
was
the
posture
of
affairs
when
the
came
up
with
his
light
the
midshipman
and
sentry
went
up
the
ladder
and
mr
and
mrs
trotter
continued
beating
each
other
to
this
none
of
them
paid
any
attention
saying
as
the
sentry
had
said
before
let
them
fight
it
out
after
they
had
fought
some
time
they
retired
behind
the
screen
and
i
followed
the
advice
of
the
midshipman
and
got
into
my
hammock
which
the
hung
up
again
for
me
i
heard
mr
and
mrs
trotter
both
crying
and
kissing
each
other
cruel
cruel
mr
trotter
said
she
blubbering
my
life
my
love
i
was
so
jealous
replied
he
d
n
and
blast
your
jealousy
replied
the
lady
i
two
nice
black
eyes
for
the
galley
after
about
an
hour
of
kissing
and
scolding
they
both
fell
asleep
again
the
next
morning
before
breakfast
the
midshipman
reported
to
the
first
lieutenant
the
conduct
of
mr
trotter
and
his
wife
i
was
sent
for
and
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
all
true
he
sent
for
mr
trotter
who
replied
that
he
was
not
well
and
could
not
come
on
deck
upon
which
the
first
lieutenant
ordered
the
sergeant
of
marines
to
bring
him
up
directly
mr
trotter
made
his
appearance
with
one
eye
closed
and
his
face
very
much
scratched
did
not
i
desire
you
sir
said
the
first
lieutenant
to
introduce
this
young
gentleman
into
the
midshipmen
berth
instead
of
which
you
have
introduced
him
to
that
disgraceful
wife
of
yours
and
have
swindled
him
out
of
his
property
i
order
you
immediately
to
return
the
three
guineas
which
you
received
as
and
also
that
your
wife
give
back
the
stockings
which
she
cajoled
him
out
of
but
then
i
interposed
and
told
the
first
lieutenant
that
the
stockings
had
been
a
free
gift
on
my
part
and
that
although
i
had
been
very
foolish
yet
that
i
considered
that
i
could
not
in
honour
demand
them
back
again
well
youngster
replied
the
first
lieutenant
perhaps
your
ideas
are
correct
and
if
you
wish
it
i
will
not
enforce
that
part
of
my
order
but
continued
he
to
mr
trotter
i
desire
sir
that
your
wife
leave
the
ship
immediately
and
i
trust
that
when
i
have
reported
your
conduct
to
the
captain
he
will
serve
you
in
the
same
manner
in
the
meantime
you
will
consider
yourself
under
an
arrest
for
drunkenness
chapter
vii
scandalum
magnatum
clearly
proved
i
prove
to
the
captain
that
i
consider
him
a
gentleman
although
i
had
told
him
the
contrary
and
i
prove
to
the
midshipmen
that
i
am
a
gentleman
myself
they
prove
their
gratitude
by
practising
upon
me
because
practice
makes
perfect
the
captain
came
on
board
about
twelve
and
ordered
the
discharge
of
mr
trotter
to
be
made
out
as
soon
as
the
first
lieutenant
had
reported
what
had
occurred
he
then
sent
for
all
the
midshipmen
on
the
gentlemen
said
the
captain
to
them
with
a
stern
countenance
i
feel
very
much
indebted
to
some
of
you
for
the
character
which
you
have
been
pleased
to
give
of
me
to
mr
simple
i
must
now
request
that
you
will
answer
a
few
questions
which
i
am
about
to
put
in
his
presence
did
i
ever
flog
the
whole
starboard
watch
because
the
ship
would
only
sail
nine
knots
on
a
bowline
no
sir
no
replied
they
all
very
much
frightened
did
i
ever
give
a
midshipman
four
dozen
for
not
having
his
weekly
accounts
or
another
five
dozen
for
wearing
a
scarlet
watch
ribbon
no
sir
replied
they
all
together
did
any
midshipman
ever
die
on
his
chest
from
fatigue
they
again
replied
in
the
negative
then
gentlemen
you
will
oblige
me
by
stating
which
of
you
thought
proper
to
assert
these
falsehoods
in
a
public
and
further
which
of
you
obliged
this
youngster
to
risk
his
life
in
a
duel
they
were
all
silent
will
you
answer
me
gentlemen
with
respect
to
the
duel
sir
replied
the
midshipman
who
had
fought
me
i
say
that
the
pistols
were
only
charged
with
powder
it
was
a
joke
well
sir
we
allow
that
the
duel
was
only
a
joke
and
i
hope
and
trust
that
your
report
is
correct
is
the
reputation
of
your
captain
only
a
joke
allow
me
to
ask
i
request
to
know
who
of
you
dared
to
propagate
such
injurious
slander
here
there
was
a
dead
pause
well
then
gentlemen
since
you
will
not
confess
yourselves
i
must
refer
to
my
authority
mr
simple
have
the
goodness
to
point
out
the
person
or
persons
who
gave
you
the
information
but
i
thought
this
would
not
be
fair
and
as
they
had
all
treated
me
very
kindly
after
the
duel
i
resolved
not
to
tell
so
i
answered
if
you
please
sir
i
consider
that
i
told
you
all
that
in
confidence
confidence
sir
replied
the
captain
who
ever
heard
of
confidence
between
a
and
a
midshipman
no
sir
replied
i
not
between
a
and
a
midshipman
but
between
two
gentlemen
the
first
lieutenant
who
stood
by
the
captain
put
his
hand
before
his
face
to
hide
a
laugh
he
may
be
a
fool
sir
observed
he
to
the
captain
aside
but
i
can
assure
you
he
is
a
very
straight
forward
one
the
captain
bit
his
lip
and
then
turning
to
the
midshipmen
said
you
may
thank
mr
simple
gentlemen
that
i
do
not
press
this
matter
further
i
do
believe
that
you
were
not
serious
when
you
calumniated
me
but
recollect
that
what
is
said
in
joke
is
too
often
repeated
in
earnest
i
trust
that
mr
simple
conduct
will
have
its
effect
and
that
you
leave
off
practising
upon
him
who
has
saved
you
from
a
very
severe
punishment
when
the
midshipmen
went
down
below
they
all
shook
hands
with
me
and
said
that
i
was
a
good
fellow
for
not
peaching
but
as
for
the
advice
of
the
captain
that
they
should
not
practise
upon
me
as
he
termed
it
they
forgot
that
for
they
commenced
again
immediately
and
never
left
off
until
they
found
that
i
was
not
to
be
deceived
any
longer
i
had
not
been
ten
minutes
in
the
berth
before
they
began
their
remarks
upon
me
one
said
that
i
looked
like
a
hardy
fellow
and
asked
me
whether
i
could
not
bear
a
great
deal
of
sleep
i
replied
that
i
could
i
dare
say
if
it
was
necessary
for
the
good
of
the
service
at
which
they
laughed
and
i
supposed
that
i
had
said
a
good
thing
why
here
tomkins
said
the
midshipman
he
show
you
how
to
perform
that
part
of
your
duty
he
inherits
it
from
his
father
who
was
a
marine
officer
he
can
snore
for
fourteen
hours
on
a
stretch
without
once
turning
round
in
his
hammock
and
finish
his
nap
on
the
chest
during
the
whole
of
the
day
except
but
tomkins
defended
himself
by
saying
that
some
people
were
very
quick
in
doing
things
and
others
were
very
slow
that
he
was
one
of
the
slow
ones
and
that
he
did
not
in
reality
obtain
more
refreshment
from
his
long
naps
than
other
people
did
in
short
ones
because
he
slept
much
slower
than
they
did
this
ingenious
argument
was
however
overruled
as
it
was
proved
that
he
ate
pudding
faster
than
any
one
in
the
mess
the
postman
came
on
board
with
the
letters
and
put
his
head
into
the
midshipman
berth
i
was
very
anxious
to
have
one
from
home
but
i
was
disappointed
some
had
letters
and
some
had
not
those
who
had
not
declared
that
their
parents
were
very
undutiful
and
that
they
would
cut
them
off
with
a
shilling
and
those
who
had
letters
after
they
had
read
them
offered
them
for
sale
to
the
others
usually
at
i
could
not
imagine
why
they
sold
or
why
the
others
bought
them
but
they
did
do
so
and
one
that
was
full
of
good
advice
was
sold
three
times
from
which
circumstance
i
was
inclined
to
form
a
better
opinion
of
the
morals
of
my
companions
the
letters
sold
were
those
written
by
sisters
i
was
offered
one
for
a
penny
but
i
declined
buying
as
i
had
plenty
of
sisters
of
my
own
directly
i
made
that
observation
they
immediately
inquired
all
their
names
and
ages
and
whether
they
were
pretty
or
not
when
i
had
informed
them
they
quarrelled
to
whom
they
should
belong
one
would
have
lucy
and
another
took
mary
but
there
was
a
great
dispute
about
ellen
as
i
had
said
that
she
was
the
prettiest
of
the
whole
at
last
they
agreed
to
put
her
up
to
auction
and
she
was
knocked
down
to
a
master
mate
of
the
name
of
who
bid
seventeen
shillings
and
a
bottle
of
rum
they
requested
that
i
would
write
home
to
give
their
love
to
my
sisters
and
tell
them
how
they
had
been
disposed
of
which
i
thought
very
strange
but
i
ought
to
have
been
flattered
at
the
price
bid
for
ellen
as
i
repeatedly
have
since
been
witness
to
a
very
pretty
sister
being
sold
for
a
glass
of
grog
i
mentioned
the
reason
why
i
was
so
anxious
for
a
letter
because
i
wanted
to
buy
my
dirk
and
cocked
hat
upon
which
they
told
me
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
my
spending
my
money
as
by
the
regulations
of
the
service
the
purser
steward
served
them
out
to
all
the
officers
who
applied
for
them
as
i
knew
where
the
purser
steward
room
was
having
seen
it
when
down
in
the
with
the
trotters
i
went
down
immediately
mr
purser
steward
said
i
let
me
have
a
cocked
hat
and
a
dirk
immediately
very
good
sir
replied
he
and
he
wrote
an
order
upon
a
slip
of
paper
which
he
handed
to
me
there
is
the
order
for
it
sir
but
the
cocked
hats
are
kept
in
the
chest
up
in
the
and
as
for
the
dirk
you
must
apply
to
the
butcher
who
has
them
under
his
charge
i
went
up
with
the
order
and
thought
i
would
first
apply
for
the
dirk
so
i
inquired
for
the
butcher
whom
i
found
sitting
in
the
with
the
sheep
mending
his
trousers
in
reply
to
my
demand
he
told
me
that
he
had
not
the
key
of
the
which
was
under
the
charge
of
one
of
the
corporals
of
marines
i
inquired
who
and
he
said
cheeks
the
marine
i
went
everywhere
about
the
ship
inquiring
for
cheeks
the
marine
but
could
not
find
him
some
said
that
they
believed
he
was
in
the
standing
sentry
over
the
wind
that
it
might
not
change
others
that
he
was
in
the
galley
to
prevent
the
midshipmen
from
soaking
their
biscuit
in
the
captain
at
last
i
inquired
of
some
of
the
women
who
were
standing
between
the
guns
on
the
and
one
of
them
answered
that
it
was
no
use
looking
for
him
among
them
as
they
all
had
husbands
and
cheeks
was
a
as
i
could
not
find
the
marine
i
thought
i
might
as
well
go
for
my
cocked
hat
and
get
my
dirk
afterwards
i
did
not
much
like
going
up
the
rigging
because
i
was
afraid
of
turning
giddy
and
if
i
fell
overboard
i
could
not
swim
but
one
of
the
midshipmen
offered
to
accompany
me
stating
that
i
need
not
be
afraid
if
i
fell
overboard
of
sinking
to
the
bottom
as
if
i
was
giddy
my
head
at
all
events
so
i
determined
to
venture
i
climbed
up
very
near
to
the
but
not
without
missing
the
little
ropes
very
often
and
grazing
the
skin
of
my
shins
then
i
came
to
large
ropes
stretched
out
from
the
mast
so
that
you
must
climb
them
with
your
head
backwards
the
midshipman
told
me
these
were
called
the
because
they
were
so
difficult
to
climb
that
a
cat
would
expostulate
if
ordered
to
go
out
by
them
i
was
afraid
to
venture
and
then
he
proposed
that
i
should
go
through
lubber
hole
which
he
said
had
been
made
for
people
like
me
i
agreed
to
attempt
it
as
it
appeared
more
easy
and
at
last
arrived
quite
out
of
breath
and
very
happy
to
find
myself
in
the
the
captain
of
the
was
there
with
two
other
sailors
the
midshipman
introduced
me
very
politely
mr
jenkins
mr
simple
midshipman
mr
simple
mr
jenkins
captain
of
the
mr
jenkins
mr
simple
has
come
up
with
an
order
for
a
cocked
hat
the
captain
of
the
top
replied
that
he
was
very
sorry
that
he
had
not
one
in
store
but
the
last
had
been
served
out
to
the
captain
monkey
this
was
very
provoking
the
captain
of
the
top
then
asked
me
if
i
was
ready
with
my
i
replied
not
very
for
i
had
lost
it
two
or
three
times
when
coming
up
he
laughed
and
replied
that
i
should
lose
it
altogether
before
i
went
down
and
that
i
must
it
out
out
my
said
i
puzzled
and
appealing
to
the
midshipman
what
does
he
mean
he
means
that
you
must
fork
out
a
bit
i
was
just
as
wise
as
ever
and
stared
very
much
when
mr
jenkins
desired
the
other
men
to
get
half
a
dozen
and
make
a
of
me
unless
he
had
his
parkisite
i
never
should
have
found
out
what
it
all
meant
had
not
the
midshipman
who
laughed
till
he
cried
at
last
informed
me
that
it
was
the
custom
to
give
the
men
something
to
drink
the
first
time
that
i
came
aloft
and
that
if
i
did
not
they
would
tie
me
up
to
the
rigging
having
no
money
in
my
pocket
i
promised
to
pay
them
as
soon
as
i
went
below
but
mr
jenkins
would
not
trust
me
i
then
became
very
angry
and
inquired
of
him
if
he
doubted
my
honour
he
replied
not
in
the
least
but
that
he
must
have
the
seven
shillings
before
i
went
below
why
sir
said
i
do
you
know
whom
you
are
speaking
to
i
am
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
do
you
know
who
my
grandfather
is
o
yes
replied
he
very
well
then
who
is
he
sir
replied
i
very
angrily
who
is
he
why
he
the
knows
no
replied
i
that
not
his
name
he
is
lord
privilege
i
was
very
much
surprised
that
he
knew
that
my
grandfather
was
a
lord
and
do
you
suppose
continued
i
that
i
would
forfeit
the
honour
of
my
family
for
a
paltry
seven
shillings
this
observation
of
mine
and
a
promise
on
the
part
of
the
midshipman
who
said
he
would
be
bail
for
me
satisfied
mr
jenkins
and
he
allowed
me
to
go
down
the
rigging
i
went
to
my
chest
and
paid
the
seven
shillings
to
one
of
the
who
followed
me
and
then
went
up
on
the
to
learn
as
much
as
i
could
of
my
profession
i
asked
a
great
many
questions
of
the
midshipmen
relative
to
the
guns
and
they
crowded
round
me
to
answer
them
one
told
me
they
were
called
the
because
they
stopped
the
frenchman
another
midshipman
said
that
he
had
been
so
often
in
action
that
he
was
called
the
i
asked
him
how
it
was
that
he
escaped
being
killed
he
replied
that
he
always
made
it
a
rule
upon
the
first
coming
through
the
ship
side
to
put
his
head
into
the
hole
which
it
had
made
as
by
a
calculation
made
by
professor
innman
the
odds
were
and
some
decimals
to
boot
that
another
ball
would
not
come
in
at
the
same
hole
that
what
i
never
should
have
thought
of
footnotes
this
celebrated
personage
is
the
prototype
of
mr
nobody
on
board
of

chapter
viii
my
messmates
show
me
the
folly
of
running
in
debt
duty
carried
on
politely
i
become
acquainted
with
some
gentlemen
of
the
home
department
the
episode
of
sholto
now
that
i
have
been
on
board
about
a
month
i
find
that
my
life
is
not
disagreeable
i
do
smell
the
pitch
and
tar
and
i
can
get
into
my
hammock
without
tumbling
out
on
the
other
side
my
messmates
are
although
they
laugh
at
me
very
much
but
i
must
say
that
they
are
not
very
nice
in
their
ideas
of
honour
they
appear
to
consider
that
to
take
you
in
is
a
capital
joke
and
that
because
they
laugh
at
the
time
that
they
are
cheating
you
it
then
becomes
no
cheating
at
all
now
i
can
not
think
otherwise
than
that
cheating
is
cheating
and
that
a
person
is
not
a
bit
more
honest
because
he
laughs
at
you
in
the
bargain
a
few
days
after
i
came
on
board
i
purchased
some
tarts
of
the
bumboat
woman
as
she
is
called
i
wished
to
pay
for
them
but
she
had
no
change
and
very
civilly
told
me
she
would
trust
me
she
produced
a
narrow
book
and
said
that
she
would
open
an
account
with
me
and
i
could
pay
her
when
i
thought
proper
to
this
arrangement
i
had
no
objection
and
i
sent
up
for
different
things
until
i
thought
that
my
account
must
have
amounted
to
eleven
or
twelve
shillings
as
i
promised
my
father
that
i
never
would
run
in
debt
i
considered
that
it
was
then
time
that
it
should
be
settled
when
i
asked
for
it
what
was
my
surprise
to
find
that
it
amounted
to
i
declared
that
it
was
impossible
and
requested
that
she
would
allow
me
to
look
at
the
items
when
i
found
that
i
was
booked
for
at
least
three
or
four
dozen
tarts
every
day
ordered
by
the
young
gentlemen
to
be
put
down
to
mr
simple
account
i
was
very
much
shocked
not
only
at
the
sum
of
money
which
i
had
to
pay
but
also
at
the
want
of
honesty
on
the
part
of
my
messmates
but
when
i
complained
of
it
in
the
berth
they
all
laughed
at
me
at
last
one
of
them
said
peter
tell
the
truth
did
not
your
father
caution
you
not
to
run
in
debt
yes
he
did
replied
i
i
know
that
very
well
replied
he
all
fathers
do
the
same
when
their
sons
leave
them
it
a
matter
of
course
now
observe
peter
it
is
out
of
regard
to
you
that
your
messmates
have
been
eating
tarts
at
your
expense
you
disobeyed
your
father
injunctions
before
you
had
been
a
month
from
home
and
it
is
to
give
you
a
lesson
that
may
be
useful
in
that
they
have
considered
it
their
duty
to
order
the
tarts
i
trust
that
it
will
not
be
thrown
away
upon
you
go
to
the
woman
pay
your
bill
and
never
run
up
another
that
i
certainly
shall
not
replied
i
but
as
i
could
not
prove
who
ordered
the
tarts
and
did
not
think
it
fair
that
the
woman
should
lose
her
money
i
went
up
and
paid
the
bill
with
a
determination
never
to
open
an
account
with
anybody
again
but
this
left
my
pockets
quite
empty
so
i
wrote
to
my
father
stating
the
whole
transaction
and
the
consequent
state
of
my
finances
my
father
in
his
answer
observed
that
whatever
might
have
been
their
motives
my
messmates
had
done
me
a
friendly
act
and
that
as
i
had
lost
my
money
by
my
own
carelessness
i
must
not
expect
that
he
would
allow
me
any
more
but
my
mother
who
added
a
postscript
to
his
letter
slipped
in
a
note
and
i
do
believe
that
it
was
with
my
father
sanction
although
he
pretended
to
be
very
angry
at
my
forgetting
his
injunctions
this
timely
relief
made
me
quite
comfortable
again
what
a
pleasure
it
is
to
receive
a
letter
from
one
friends
when
far
away
especially
when
there
is
same
money
in
it
a
few
days
before
this
mr
falcon
the
first
lieutenant
ordered
me
to
put
on
my
to
go
away
on
duty
i
replied
that
i
had
neither
dirk
nor
cocked
hat
although
i
had
applied
for
them
he
laughed
at
my
story
and
sent
me
on
shore
with
the
master
who
bought
them
and
the
first
lieutenant
sent
up
the
bill
to
my
father
who
paid
it
and
wrote
to
thank
him
for
his
trouble
that
morning
the
first
lieutenant
said
to
me
now
mr
simple
we
take
the
shine
off
that
cocked
hat
and
dirk
of
yours
you
will
go
in
the
boat
with
mr
and
take
care
that
none
of
the
men
slip
away
from
it
and
get
drunk
at
the
tap
this
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
ever
been
sent
away
on
duty
and
i
was
very
proud
of
being
an
officer
in
charge
i
put
on
my
full
uniform
and
was
ready
at
the
gangway
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
men
were
piped
away
we
were
ordered
to
the
dockyard
to
draw
sea
stores
when
we
arrived
there
i
was
quite
astonished
at
the
piles
of
timber
the
ranges
of
storehouses
and
the
immense
anchors
which
lay
on
the
wharf
there
was
such
a
bustle
every
body
appeared
to
be
so
busy
that
i
wanted
to
look
every
way
at
once
close
to
where
the
boat
landed
they
were
hauling
a
large
frigate
out
of
what
they
called
the
basin
and
i
was
so
interested
with
the
sight
that
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
quite
forgot
all
about
the
boat
crew
and
my
orders
to
look
after
them
what
surprised
me
most
was
that
although
the
men
employed
appeared
to
be
sailors
their
language
was
very
different
from
what
i
had
been
lately
accustomed
to
on
board
of
the
frigate
instead
of
damning
and
swearing
everybody
was
so
polite
oblige
me
with
a
pull
of
the
starboard
bow
hawser
mr
jones
ease
off
the
larboard
hawser
mr
jenkins
if
you
please
side
her
over
gentlemen
side
her
over
my
compliments
to
mr
tompkins
and
request
that
he
will
cast
off
the
side
her
over
gentlemen
side
her
over
if
you
please
in
the
boat
there
pull
to
mr
simmons
and
beg
he
do
me
the
favour
to
check
her
as
she
swings
what
the
matter
mr
johnson
vy
there
one
of
them
ere
midshipmites
has
thrown
a
red
hot
tater
out
of
the
and
hit
our
officer
in
the
eye
report
him
to
the
commissioner
mr
wiggins
and
oblige
me
by
the
tell
mr
simkins
with
my
compliments
to
coil
away
upon
the
jetty
side
her
over
side
her
over
gentlemen
if
you
please
i
asked
of
a
bystander
who
these
people
were
and
he
told
me
that
they
were
dockyard
mateys
i
certainly
thought
that
it
appeared
to
be
quite
as
easy
to
say
if
you
please
as
d
n
your
eyes
and
that
it
sounded
much
more
agreeable
during
the
time
that
i
was
looking
at
the
frigate
being
hauled
out
two
of
the
men
belonging
to
the
boat
slipped
away
and
on
my
return
they
were
not
to
be
seen
i
was
very
much
frightened
for
i
knew
that
i
had
neglected
my
duty
and
that
on
the
first
occasion
on
which
i
had
been
intrusted
with
a
responsible
service
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
i
ran
up
and
down
every
part
of
the
dockyard
until
i
was
quite
out
of
breath
asking
everybody
i
met
whether
they
had
seen
my
two
men
many
of
them
said
that
they
had
seen
plenty
of
men
but
did
not
exactly
know
mine
some
laughed
and
called
me
a
greenhorn
at
last
i
met
a
midshipman
who
told
me
that
he
had
seen
two
men
answering
to
my
description
on
the
roof
of
the
coach
starting
for
london
and
that
i
must
be
quick
if
i
wished
to
catch
them
but
he
would
not
stop
to
answer
any
more
questions
i
continued
walking
about
the
yard
until
i
met
twenty
or
thirty
men
with
grey
jackets
and
breeches
to
whom
i
applied
for
information
they
told
me
that
they
had
seen
two
sailors
skulking
behind
the
piles
of
timber
they
crowded
round
me
and
appeared
very
anxious
to
assist
me
when
they
were
summoned
away
to
carry
down
a
cable
i
observed
that
they
all
had
numbers
on
their
jackets
and
either
one
or
two
bright
iron
rings
on
their
legs
i
could
not
help
inquiring
although
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
why
the
rings
were
worn
one
of
them
replied
that
they
were
orders
of
merit
given
to
them
for
their
good
behaviour
i
was
proceeding
on
very
disconsolately
when
as
i
turned
a
corner
to
my
great
delight
i
met
my
two
men
who
touched
their
hats
and
said
that
they
had
been
looking
for
me
i
did
not
believe
that
they
told
the
truth
but
i
was
so
glad
to
recover
them
that
i
did
not
scold
but
went
with
them
down
to
the
boat
which
had
been
waiting
some
time
for
us
the
master
mate
called
me
a
young
sculping
a
word
i
never
heard
before
when
we
arrived
on
board
the
first
lieutenant
asked
why
he
had
remained
so
long
he
answered
that
two
of
the
men
had
left
the
boat
but
that
i
had
found
them
the
first
lieutenant
appeared
to
be
pleased
with
me
observing
as
he
had
said
before
that
i
was
no
fool
and
i
went
down
below
overjoyed
at
my
good
fortune
and
very
much
obliged
to
for
not
telling
the
whole
truth
after
i
had
taken
off
my
dirk
and
cocked
hat
i
felt
for
my
and
found
that
it
was
not
in
my
pocket
having
in
all
probability
been
taken
out
by
the
men
in
grey
jackets
whom
in
conversation
with
my
messmates
i
discovered
to
be
convicts
condemned
to
hard
labour
for
stealing
and
picking
pockets
a
day
or
two
afterwards
we
had
a
new
messmate
of
the
name
of
i
was
on
the
when
he
came
on
board
and
presented
a
letter
to
the
captain
inquiring
first
if
his
name
was
captain
sauvage
he
was
a
florid
young
man
nearly
six
feet
high
with
sandy
hair
yet
very
as
his
career
in
the
service
was
very
short
i
will
tell
at
once
what
i
did
not
find
out
till
some
time
afterwards
the
captain
had
agreed
to
receive
him
to
oblige
a
brother
officer
who
had
retired
from
the
service
and
lived
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
the
first
notice
which
the
captain
had
of
the
arrival
of
mr
was
from
a
letter
written
to
him
by
the
young
man
uncle
this
amused
him
so
much
that
he
gave
it
to
the
first
lieutenant
to
read
it
ran
as
follows
glasgow
april
sir
our
much
esteemed
and
mutual
friend
captain
having
communicated
by
letter
dated
the
your
kind
intentions
relative
to
my
nephew
sholto
for
which
you
will
be
pleased
to
accept
my
best
thanks
i
write
to
acquaint
you
that
he
is
now
on
his
way
to
join
your
ship
the
and
will
arrive
god
willing
hours
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
as
i
have
been
given
to
understand
by
those
who
have
some
acquaintance
with
the
service
of
the
king
that
his
equipment
as
an
officer
will
be
somewhat
expensive
i
have
considered
it
but
fair
to
ease
your
mind
as
to
any
responsibility
on
that
score
and
have
therefore
enclosed
the
half
of
a
bank
of
england
note
for
ten
pounds
sterling
no
the
other
half
of
which
will
be
duly
forwarded
in
a
frank
promised
to
me
the
day
after
i
beg
you
will
make
the
necessary
purchases
and
apply
the
balance
should
there
be
any
to
his
mess
account
or
any
other
expenses
which
you
may
consider
warrantable
or
justifiable
it
is
at
the
same
time
proper
to
inform
you
that
sholto
had
ten
shillings
in
his
pocket
at
the
time
of
his
leaving
glasgow
the
satisfactory
expenditure
of
which
i
have
no
doubt
you
will
inquire
into
as
it
is
a
large
sum
to
be
placed
at
the
discretion
of
a
youth
only
fourteen
years
and
five
months
old
i
mention
his
age
as
sholto
is
so
tall
that
you
might
be
deceived
by
his
appearance
and
be
induced
to
trust
to
his
prudence
in
affairs
of
this
serious
nature
should
he
at
any
time
require
further
assistance
beyond
his
pay
which
i
am
told
is
extremely
handsome
to
all
king
officers
i
beg
you
to
consider
that
any
draught
of
yours
at
ten
days
sight
to
the
amount
of
five
pounds
sterling
english
will
be
duly
honoured
by
the
firm
of
monteith
and
company
of
glasgow
sir
with
many
thanks
for
your
kindness
and
consideration
i
remain
your
most
obedient
walter
monteith
the
letter
brought
on
board
by
was
to
prove
his
identity
while
the
captain
read
it
stared
about
him
like
a
wild
stag
the
captain
welcomed
him
to
the
ship
asked
him
one
or
two
questions
introduced
him
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
then
went
on
shore
the
first
lieutenant
had
asked
me
to
dine
in
the
i
supposed
that
he
was
pleased
with
me
because
i
had
found
the
men
and
when
the
captain
pulled
on
shore
he
also
invited
mr
when
the
following
conversation
took
place
well
mr
you
have
had
a
long
journey
i
presume
it
is
the
first
that
you
have
ever
made
indeed
it
is
sir
replied
and
sorely
i
been
pestered
had
i
minded
all
they
whispered
in
my
lug
as
i
came
along
i
had
need
been
made
of
money
here
there
every
where
sich
extortion
i
dreamt
of
how
did
you
come
from
glasgow
by
the
wheelboat
or
steamboat
as
they
ca
it
to
lunnon
where
they
charged
me
for
taking
my
baggage
on
shore
a
wee
boxy
nae
bigger
than
yon
hat
i
would
fain
carry
it
mysel
but
they
wadna
let
me
well
where
did
you
go
to
when
you
arrived
in
london
i
went
to
a
place
ca
chichester
rents
to
the
house
of
storm
and
mainwaring
warehousemen
and
they
must
have
another
for
showing
me
the
way
there
i
waited
in
the
till
they
took
me
to
a
place
ca
bull
and
mouth
and
put
me
into
a
coach
paying
my
whole
fare
nevertheless
they
must
din
me
for
money
the
whole
of
the
way
down
there
was
first
the
guard
and
then
the
coachman
and
another
guard
and
another
coachman
but
i
wudna
listen
to
them
and
so
they
growled
and
abused
me
and
when
did
you
arrive
i
came
here
last
night
and
i
only
had
a
bed
and
a
breakfast
at
the
twa
blue
pillars
house
for
which
they
extortioned
me
three
shillings
and
as
i
sit
here
and
then
there
was
the
chambermaid
hussy
and
waiter
loon
axed
me
to
remember
them
and
wanted
more
siller
but
i
told
them
as
i
told
the
guard
and
coachman
that
i
had
none
for
them
how
much
of
your
ten
shillings
have
you
left
inquired
the
first
lieutenant
smiling
hoot
sir
lieutenant
how
came
you
for
to
ken
that
eh
it
my
uncle
monteith
at
glasgow
why
as
i
sit
here
i
but
three
shillings
and
a
penny
of
it
lift
but
there
a
smell
here
that
no
canny
so
i
just
go
up
again
into
the
fresh
air
when
mr
quitted
the
they
all
laughed
very
much
after
he
had
been
a
short
time
on
deck
he
went
down
into
the
midshipmen
berth
but
he
made
himself
very
unpleasant
quarrelling
and
wrangling
with
everybody
it
did
not
however
last
very
long
for
he
would
not
obey
any
orders
that
were
given
to
him
on
the
third
day
he
quitted
the
ship
without
asking
the
permission
of
the
first
lieutenant
when
he
returned
on
board
the
following
day
the
first
lieutenant
put
him
under
an
arrest
and
in
charge
of
the
sentry
at
the
cabin
door
during
the
afternoon
i
was
under
the
and
perceived
that
he
was
sharpening
a
long
upon
the
of
the
gun
i
went
up
to
him
and
asked
him
why
he
was
doing
so
and
he
replied
as
his
eyes
flashed
fire
that
it
was
to
revenge
the
insult
offered
to
the
bluid
of
his
look
told
me
that
he
was
in
earnest
but
what
do
you
mean
inquired
i
i
mean
said
he
drawing
the
edge
and
feeling
the
point
of
his
weapon
to
put
it
into
the
weam
of
that
man
with
the
gold
podge
on
his
shoulder
who
has
dared
to
place
me
here
i
was
very
much
alarmed
and
thought
it
my
duty
to
state
his
murderous
intentions
or
worse
might
happen
so
i
walked
up
on
deck
and
told
the
first
lieutenant
what
was
intending
to
do
and
how
his
life
was
in
danger
mr
falcon
laughed
and
shortly
afterwards
went
down
on
the
eyes
glistened
and
he
walked
forward
to
where
the
first
lieutenant
was
standing
but
the
sentry
who
had
been
cautioned
by
me
kept
him
back
with
his
bayonet
the
first
lieutenant
turned
round
and
perceiving
what
was
going
on
desired
the
sentry
to
see
if
mr
had
a
knife
in
his
hand
and
he
had
it
sure
enough
open
and
held
behind
his
back
he
was
disarmed
and
the
first
lieutenant
perceiving
that
the
lad
meant
mischief
reported
his
conduct
to
the
captain
on
his
arrival
on
board
the
captain
sent
for
who
was
very
obstinate
and
when
taxed
with
his
intention
would
not
deny
it
or
even
say
that
he
would
not
again
attempt
it
so
he
was
sent
on
shore
immediately
and
returned
to
his
friends
in
the
highlands
we
never
saw
any
more
of
him
but
i
heard
that
he
obtained
a
commission
in
the
army
and
three
months
after
he
had
joined
his
regiment
was
killed
in
a
duel
resenting
some
fancied
affront
offered
to
the
bluid

a
few
days
after
quitted
the
ship
we
all
had
leave
from
the
first
lieutenant
to
go
to
portsdown
fair
but
he
would
only
allow
the
oldsters
to
sleep
on
shore
we
anticipated
so
much
pleasure
from
our
excursion
that
some
of
us
were
up
early
enough
to
go
away
in
the
boat
sent
for
fresh
beef
this
was
very
foolish
there
were
no
carriages
to
take
us
to
the
fair
nor
indeed
any
fair
so
early
in
the
morning
the
shops
were
all
shut
and
the
blue
posts
where
we
always
rendezvoused
was
hardly
opened
we
waited
there
in
the
until
we
were
driven
out
by
the
maid
sweeping
away
the
dirt
and
were
forced
to
walk
about
until
she
had
finished
and
lighted
the
fire
when
we
ordered
our
breakfast
but
how
much
better
would
it
have
been
to
have
taken
our
breakfast
comfortably
on
board
and
then
to
have
come
on
shore
especially
as
we
had
no
money
to
spare
next
to
being
too
late
being
too
soon
is
the
worst
plan
in
the
world
however
we
had
our
breakfast
and
paid
the
bill
then
we
sallied
forth
and
went
up
where
we
found
all
sorts
of
vehicles
ready
to
take
us
to
the
fair
we
got
into
one
which
they
called
a
dilly
i
asked
the
man
who
drove
it
why
it
was
so
called
and
he
replied
because
he
only
charged
a
shilling
who
had
joined
us
after
breakfasting
on
board
said
that
this
answer
reminded
him
of
one
given
to
him
by
a
man
who
attended
the
stands
in
london
pray
said
he
why
are
you
called
waterman
waterman
replied
the
man
vy
sir
we
opens
the
doors
at
last
with
plenty
of
whipping
and
plenty
of
swearing
and
a
great
deal
of
laughing
the
old
horse
whose
back
curved
upwards
like
a
bow
from
the
difficulty
of
dragging
so
many
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
portsdown
hill
where
we
got
out
and
walked
up
to
the
fair
it
really
was
a
most
beautiful
sight
the
bright
blue
sky
and
the
coloured
flags
flapping
about
in
all
directions
the
grass
so
green
and
the
white
tents
and
booths
the
sun
shining
so
bright
and
the
shining
gilt
gingerbread
the
variety
of
toys
and
the
variety
of
noise
the
quantity
of
people
and
the
quantity
of
sweetmeats
little
boys
so
happy
and
so
polite
the
music
at
the
booths
and
the
bustle
and
eagerness
of
the
people
outside
made
my
heart
quite
jump
there
was
richardson
with
a
clown
and
harlequin
and
such
beautiful
women
dressed
in
clothes
all
over
gold
spangles
dancing
reels
and
waltzes
and
looking
so
happy
there
was
flint
and
gyngell
with
fellows
tumbling
over
head
and
heels
playing
such
tricks
eating
fire
and
drawing
yards
of
tape
out
of
their
mouths
then
there
was
the
royal
circus
all
the
horses
standing
in
a
line
with
men
and
women
standing
on
their
backs
waving
flags
while
the
trumpeters
blew
their
trumpets
and
the
largest
giant
in
the
world
and
mr
paap
the
smallest
dwarf
in
the
world
and
a
female
dwarf
who
was
smaller
still
and
miss
biffin
who
did
everything
without
legs
or
arms
there
was
also
the
learned
pig
and
the
herefordshire
ox
and
a
hundred
other
sights
which
i
can
not
now
remember
we
walked
about
for
an
hour
or
two
seeing
the
outside
of
every
thing
we
determined
to
go
and
see
the
inside
first
we
went
into
richardson
where
we
saw
a
bloody
tragedy
with
a
ghost
and
thunder
and
afterwards
a
pantomime
full
of
tricks
and
tumbling
over
one
another
then
we
saw
one
or
two
other
things
i
forget
what
but
this
i
know
that
generally
speaking
the
outside
was
better
than
the
inside
after
this
feeling
very
hungry
we
agreed
to
go
into
a
booth
and
have
something
to
eat
the
tables
were
ranged
all
round
and
in
the
centre
there
was
a
boarded
platform
for
dancing
the
ladies
were
there
all
ready
dressed
for
partners
and
the
music
was
so
lively
that
i
felt
very
much
inclined
to
dance
but
we
had
agreed
to
go
and
see
the
wild
beasts
fed
at
mr
polito
menagerie
and
as
it
was
now
almost
eight
we
paid
our
bill
and
set
off
it
was
a
very
curious
sight
and
better
worth
seeing
than
any
thing
in
the
fair
i
never
had
an
idea
that
there
were
so
many
strange
animals
in
existence
they
were
all
secured
in
iron
cages
and
a
large
chandelier
with
twenty
lights
hung
in
the
centre
of
the
booth
and
lighted
them
up
while
the
keeper
went
round
and
stirred
them
up
with
his
long
pole
at
the
same
time
he
gave
us
their
histories
which
were
very
interesting
i
recollect
a
few
of
them
there
was
the
tapir
a
great
pig
with
a
long
nose
a
variety
of
the
hiptostamass
which
the
keeper
said
was
an
amphibilious
animal
as
could
live
on
land
and
in
the
water
however
it
seemed
to
live
very
well
in
a
cage
then
there
was
the
kangaroo
with
its
young
ones
peeping
out
of
it
a
most
astonishing
animal
the
keeper
said
that
it
brought
forth
two
young
ones
at
a
birth
and
then
took
them
into
its
stomach
again
until
they
arrived
at
years
of
discretion
then
there
was
the
pelican
of
the
wilderness
i
shall
not
forget
him
with
a
large
bag
under
his
throat
which
the
man
put
on
his
head
as
a
this
bird
feeds
its
young
with
its
own
blood
when
fish
are
scarce
and
there
was
the
laughing
hyæna
who
cries
in
the
wood
like
a
human
being
in
distress
and
devours
those
who
come
to
his
assistance
a
sad
instance
of
the
depravity
of
human
nature
as
the
keeper
observed
there
was
a
beautiful
creature
the
royal
bengal
tiger
only
three
years
old
what
growed
ten
inches
every
year
and
never
arrived
at
its
full
growth
the
one
we
saw
measured
as
the
keeper
told
us
sixteen
feet
from
the
snout
to
the
tail
and
seventeen
from
the
tail
to
the
snout
but
there
must
have
been
some
mistake
there
there
was
a
young
elephant
and
three
lions
and
several
other
animals
which
i
forget
now
so
i
shall
go
on
to
describe
the
tragical
scene
which
occurred
the
keeper
had
poked
up
all
the
animals
and
had
commenced
feeding
them
the
great
lion
was
growling
and
snarling
over
the
of
an
ox
cracking
it
like
a
nut
when
by
some
mismanagement
one
end
of
the
pole
upon
which
the
chandelier
was
suspended
fell
down
striking
the
door
of
the
cage
in
which
the
lioness
was
at
supper
and
bursting
it
open
it
was
all
done
in
a
second
the
chandelier
fell
the
cage
opened
and
the
lioness
sprang
out
i
remember
to
this
moment
seeing
the
body
of
the
lioness
in
the
air
and
then
all
was
dark
as
pitch
what
a
change
not
a
moment
before
all
of
us
staring
with
delight
and
curiosity
and
then
to
be
left
in
darkness
horror
and
dismay
there
was
such
screaming
and
shrieking
such
crying
and
fighting
and
pushing
and
fainting
nobody
knew
where
to
go
or
how
to
find
their
way
out
the
people
crowded
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
as
their
fears
instigated
them
i
was
very
soon
jammed
up
with
my
back
against
the
bars
of
one
of
the
cages
and
feeling
some
beast
lay
hold
of
me
behind
made
a
desperate
effort
and
succeeded
in
climbing
up
to
the
cage
above
not
however
without
losing
the
seat
of
my
trowsers
which
the
laughing
hyæna
would
not
let
go
i
hardly
knew
where
i
was
when
i
climbed
up
but
i
knew
the
birds
were
mostly
stationed
above
however
that
i
might
not
have
the
front
of
my
trowsers
torn
as
well
as
the
behind
as
soon
as
i
gained
my
footing
i
turned
round
with
my
back
to
the
bars
of
the
cage
but
i
had
not
been
there
a
minute
before
i
was
attacked
by
something
which
digged
into
me
like
a
pickaxe
and
as
the
hyæna
had
torn
my
clothes
i
had
no
defence
against
it
to
turn
round
would
have
been
worse
still
so
after
having
received
above
a
dozen
stabs
i
contrived
by
degrees
to
shift
my
position
until
i
was
opposite
to
another
cage
but
not
until
the
pelican
for
it
was
that
brute
had
drawn
as
much
blood
from
me
as
would
have
fed
his
young
for
a
week
i
was
surmising
what
danger
i
should
next
encounter
when
to
my
joy
i
discovered
that
i
had
gained
the
open
door
from
which
the
lioness
had
escaped
i
crawled
in
and
pulled
the
door
to
after
me
thinking
myself
very
fortunate
and
there
i
sat
very
quietly
in
a
corner
during
the
remainder
of
the
noise
and
confusion
i
had
been
there
but
a
few
minutes
when
the
as
they
were
called
who
played
the
music
outside
came
in
with
torches
and
loaded
muskets
the
sight
which
presented
itself
was
truly
shocking
twenty
or
thirty
men
women
and
children
lay
on
the
ground
and
i
thought
at
first
the
lioness
had
killed
them
all
but
they
were
only
in
fits
or
had
been
trampled
down
by
the
crowd
no
one
was
seriously
hurt
as
for
the
lioness
she
was
not
to
be
found
and
as
soon
as
it
was
ascertained
that
she
had
escaped
there
was
as
much
terror
and
scampering
away
outside
as
there
had
been
in
the
menagerie
it
appeared
afterwards
that
the
animal
had
been
as
much
frightened
as
we
had
been
and
had
secreted
herself
under
one
of
the
waggons
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
be
found
at
last
who
was
a
very
brave
fellow
went
of
the
and
saw
her
eyes
glaring
they
borrowed
a
net
or
two
from
the
carts
which
had
brought
calves
to
the
fair
and
threw
them
over
her
when
she
was
fairly
entangled
they
dragged
her
by
the
tail
into
the
menagerie
all
this
while
i
had
remained
very
quietly
in
the
den
but
when
i
perceived
that
its
lawful
owner
had
come
back
to
retake
possession
i
thought
it
was
time
to
come
out
so
i
called
to
my
messmates
who
with
were
assisting
the
they
had
not
discovered
me
and
laughed
very
much
when
they
saw
where
i
was
one
of
the
midshipmen
shot
the
bolt
of
the
door
so
that
i
could
not
jump
out
and
then
stirred
me
up
with
a
long
pole
at
last
i
contrived
to
unbolt
it
again
and
got
out
when
they
laughed
still
more
at
the
seat
of
my
trowsers
being
torn
off
it
was
not
exactly
a
laughing
matter
to
me
although
i
had
to
congratulate
myself
upon
a
very
lucky
escape
and
so
did
my
messmates
think
when
i
narrated
my
adventures
the
pelican
was
the
worst
part
of
the
business
lent
me
a
dark
silk
handkerchief
which
i
tied
round
my
waist
and
let
drop
behind
so
that
my
misfortunes
might
not
attract
any
notice
and
then
we
quitted
the
menagerie
but
i
was
so
stiff
that
i
could
scarcely
walk
we
then
went
to
what
they
called
the
ranelagh
gardens
to
see
the
fireworks
which
were
to
be
let
off
at
ten
it
was
exactly
ten
when
we
paid
for
our
admission
and
we
waited
very
patiently
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
there
were
no
signs
of
the
fireworks
being
displayed
the
fact
was
that
the
man
to
whom
the
gardens
belonged
waited
until
more
company
should
arrive
although
the
place
was
already
very
full
of
people
now
the
first
lieutenant
had
ordered
the
boat
to
wait
for
us
until
twelve
and
then
return
on
board
and
as
we
were
seven
miles
from
portsmouth
we
had
not
much
time
to
spare
we
waited
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
it
was
agreed
that
as
the
fireworks
were
stated
in
the
handbill
to
commence
precisely
at
ten
we
were
fully
justified
in
letting
them
off
ourselves
went
out
and
returned
with
a
dozen
penny
rattans
which
he
notched
in
the
end
the
fireworks
were
on
the
posts
and
stages
all
ready
and
it
was
agreed
that
we
should
light
them
all
at
once
and
then
mix
with
the
crowd
the
oldsters
lighted
cigars
and
fixing
them
in
the
notched
end
of
the
canes
continued
to
puff
them
until
they
were
all
well
lighted
they
handed
one
to
each
of
us
and
at
a
signal
we
all
applied
them
to
the
match
papers
and
as
soon
as
the
fire
communicated
we
threw
down
our
canes
and
ran
in
among
the
crowd
in
about
half
a
minute
off
they
all
went
in
a
most
beautiful
confusion
there
were
silver
stars
and
golden
stars
blue
lights
and
mines
and
bombs
and
rockets
and
illuminated
mottoes
all
firing
away
cracking
popping
and
fizzing
at
the
same
time
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
it
was
a
great
improvement
upon
the
intended
show
the
man
to
whom
the
gardens
belonged
ran
out
of
a
booth
where
he
had
been
drinking
beer
at
his
ease
while
his
company
were
waiting
swearing
vengeance
against
the
perpetrators
indeed
the
next
day
he
offered
fifty
pounds
reward
for
the
discovery
of
the
offenders
but
i
think
that
he
was
treated
very
properly
he
was
in
his
situation
a
servant
of
the
public
and
he
had
behaved
as
if
he
was
their
master
we
all
escaped
very
cleverly
and
taking
another
dilly
arrived
at
portsmouth
and
were
down
to
the
boat
in
good
time
the
next
day
i
was
so
stiff
and
in
such
pain
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
to
the
doctor
who
put
me
on
the
list
where
i
remained
a
week
before
i
could
return
to
my
duty
so
much
for
portsdown
fair
it
was
on
a
saturday
that
i
returned
to
my
duty
and
sunday
being
a
fine
day
we
all
went
on
shore
to
church
with
mr
falcon
the
first
lieutenant
we
liked
going
to
church
very
much
not
i
am
sorry
to
say
from
religious
feelings
but
for
the
following
reason
the
first
lieutenant
sat
in
a
pew
below
and
we
were
placed
in
the
gallery
above
where
he
could
not
see
us
nor
indeed
could
we
see
him
we
all
remained
very
quiet
and
i
may
say
very
devout
during
the
time
of
the
service
but
the
clergyman
who
delivered
the
sermon
was
so
tedious
and
had
such
a
bad
voice
that
we
generally
slipped
out
as
soon
as
he
went
up
into
the
pulpit
and
adjourned
to
a
opposite
to
eat
cakes
and
tarts
and
drink
which
we
infinitely
preferred
to
hearing
a
sermon
somehow
or
other
the
first
lieutenant
had
scent
of
our
proceedings
we
believed
that
the
marine
officer
informed
against
us
and
this
sunday
he
served
us
a
pretty
trick
we
had
been
at
the
as
usual
and
as
soon
as
we
perceived
the
people
coming
out
of
church
we
put
all
our
tarts
and
sweetmeats
into
our
hats
which
we
then
slipped
on
our
heads
and
took
our
station
at
the
as
if
we
had
just
come
down
from
the
gallery
and
had
been
waiting
for
him
instead
however
of
appearing
at
the
he
walked
up
the
street
and
desired
us
to
follow
him
to
the
boat
the
fact
was
he
had
been
in
the
at
the
watching
our
motions
through
the
green
blinds
we
had
no
suspicion
but
thought
that
he
had
come
out
of
church
a
little
sooner
than
usual
when
we
arrived
on
board
and
followed
him
up
the
side
he
said
to
us
as
we
came
on
deck
walk
aft
young
gentlemen
we
did
and
he
desired
us
to
toe
a
line
which
means
to
stand
in
a
row
now
mr
dixon
said
he
what
was
the
text
as
he
very
often
asked
us
that
question
we
always
left
one
in
the
church
until
the
text
was
given
out
who
brought
it
to
us
in
the
shop
when
we
all
marked
it
in
our
bibles
to
be
ready
if
he
asked
us
dixon
immediately
pulled
out
his
bible
where
he
had
marked
down
the
leaf
and
read
it
o
that
was
it
said
mr
falcon
you
must
have
remarkably
good
ears
mr
dixon
to
have
heard
the
clergyman
from
the
shop
now
gentlemen
hats
off
if
you
please
we
all
slided
off
our
hats
which
as
he
expected
were
full
of
pastry
really
gentlemen
said
he
feeling
the
different
papers
of
pastry
and
sweetmeats
i
am
quite
delighted
to
perceive
that
you
have
not
been
to
church
for
nothing
few
come
away
with
so
many
good
things
pressed
upon
their
seat
of
memory
send
all
the
ship
boys
aft
the
boys
all
came
tumbling
up
the
ladders
and
the
first
lieutenant
desired
each
of
them
to
take
a
seat
upon
the
carronade
slides
when
they
were
all
stationed
he
ordered
us
to
go
round
with
our
hats
and
request
of
each
his
acceptance
of
a
tart
which
we
were
obliged
to
do
handing
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
until
the
hats
were
all
empty
what
annoyed
me
more
than
all
was
the
grinning
of
the
boys
at
their
being
served
by
us
like
as
well
as
the
ridicule
and
laughter
of
the
whole
ship
company
who
had
assembled
at
the
gangways
when
all
the
pastry
was
devoured
the
first
lieutenant
said
there
gentlemen
now
that
you
have
had
your
lesson
for
the
day
you
may
go
below
we
could
not
help
laughing
ourselves
when
we
went
down
into
the
berth
mr
falcon
always
punished
us
and
in
some
way
or
other
his
punishments
were
severally
connected
with
the
description
of
the
offence
he
always
had
a
remedy
for
every
thing
that
he
disapproved
of
and
the
ship
company
used
to
call
him
remedy
jack
i
ought
to
observe
that
some
of
my
messmates
were
very
severe
upon
the
ship
boys
after
that
circumstance
always
giving
them
a
kick
or
a
cuff
on
the
head
whenever
they
could
telling
them
at
the
same
time
there
another
tart
for
you
you
whelp
i
believe
if
the
boys
had
known
what
was
in
reserve
for
them
they
would
much
rather
have
left
the
pastry
alone
chapter
x
a

off
by
one
woman
dangers
at
spithead
and
point
a
treat
for
both
parties
of
at
my
expense
also
gin
for
twenty
i
am
made
a
prisoner
escape
and
rejoin
my
ship
i
must
now
relate
what
occurred
to
me
a
few
days
before
the
ship
sailed
which
will
prove
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
encounter
the
winds
and
waves
or
the
cannon
of
the
enemy
to
be
in
danger
when
you
have
entered
his
majesty
service
on
the
contrary
i
have
been
in
action
since
and
i
declare
without
hesitation
that
i
did
not
feel
so
much
alarm
on
that
occasion
as
i
did
on
the
one
of
which
i
am
about
to
give
the
history
we
were
reported
ready
for
sea
and
the
admiralty
was
anxious
that
we
should
proceed
the
only
obstacle
to
our
sailing
was
that
we
had
not
yet
completed
our
complement
of
men
the
captain
applied
to
the
and
obtained
permission
to
send
parties
on
shore
to
impress
seamen
the
second
and
third
lieutenants
and
the
oldest
midshipman
were
despatched
on
shore
every
night
with
some
of
the
most
trustworthy
men
and
generally
brought
on
board
in
the
morning
about
half
a
dozen
men
whom
they
had
picked
up
in
the
different
alehouses
or
as
the
sailors
call
them
some
of
them
were
retained
but
most
of
them
sent
on
shore
as
unserviceable
for
it
is
the
custom
when
a
man
either
enters
or
is
impressed
to
send
him
down
to
the
surgeon
in
the
cockpit
where
he
is
stripped
and
examined
all
over
to
see
if
he
be
sound
and
fit
for
his
majesty
service
and
if
not
he
is
sent
on
shore
again
impressing
appeared
to
be
rather
serious
work
as
far
as
i
could
judge
from
the
accounts
which
i
heard
and
from
the
way
in
which
our
sailors
who
were
employed
on
the
service
were
occasionally
beaten
and
wounded
the
seamen
who
were
impressed
appearing
to
fight
as
hard
not
to
be
forced
into
the
service
as
they
did
for
the
honour
of
the
country
after
they
were
fairly
embarked
in
it
i
had
a
great
wish
to
be
one
of
the
party
before
the
ship
sailed
and
asked
who
was
very
kind
to
me
in
general
and
allowed
nobody
to
thrash
me
but
himself
if
he
would
take
me
with
him
which
he
did
on
the
night
after
i
had
made
the
request
i
put
on
my
dirk
that
they
might
know
i
was
an
officer
as
well
as
for
my
protection
about
dusk
we
rowed
on
shore
and
landed
on
the
gosport
side
the
men
were
all
armed
with
cutlasses
and
wore
pea
jackets
which
are
very
short
made
of
what
they
call
flushing
we
did
not
stop
to
look
at
any
of
the
in
the
town
as
it
was
too
early
but
walked
out
about
three
miles
in
the
suburbs
and
went
to
a
house
the
door
of
which
was
locked
but
we
forced
it
open
in
a
minute
and
hastened
to
enter
the
passage
where
we
found
the
landlady
standing
to
defend
the
entrance
the
passage
was
long
and
narrow
and
she
was
a
very
tall
corpulent
woman
so
that
her
body
nearly
filled
it
up
and
in
her
hands
she
held
a
long
spit
pointed
at
us
with
which
she
kept
us
at
bay
the
officers
who
were
the
foremost
did
not
like
to
attack
a
woman
and
she
made
such
drives
at
them
with
her
spit
that
had
they
not
retreated
some
of
them
would
soon
have
been
ready
for
roasting
the
sailors
laughed
and
stood
outside
leaving
the
officers
to
settle
the
business
how
they
could
at
last
the
landlady
called
out
to
her
husband
be
they
all
out
jem
yes
replied
the
husband
they
be
all
safe
gone
well
then
replied
she
i
soon
have
all
these
gone
too
and
with
these
words
she
made
such
a
rush
forward
upon
us
with
her
spit
that
had
we
not
fallen
back
and
tumbled
one
over
another
she
certainly
would
have
run
it
through
the
second
lieutenant
who
commanded
the
party
the
passage
was
cleared
in
an
instant
and
as
soon
as
we
were
all
in
the
street
she
bolted
us
out
so
there
we
were
three
officers
and
fifteen
armed
men
fairly
beat
off
by
a
fat
old
woman
the
sailors
who
had
been
drinking
in
the
house
having
made
their
escape
to
some
other
place
but
i
do
not
well
see
how
it
could
be
otherwise
either
we
must
have
killed
or
wounded
the
woman
or
she
would
have
run
us
through
she
was
so
resolute
had
her
husband
been
in
the
passage
he
would
have
been
settled
in
a
very
short
time
but
what
can
you
do
with
a
woman
who
fights
like
a
devil
and
yet
claims
all
the
rights
and
immunities
of
the
softer
sex
we
all
walked
away
looking
very
foolish
and
observed
that
the
next
time
he
called
at
that
house
he
would
weather
the
old
cat
for
he
would
take
her
ladyship
in
the
rear
we
then
called
at
other
houses
where
we
picked
up
one
or
two
men
but
most
of
them
escaped
by
getting
out
at
the
windows
or
the
back
doors
as
we
entered
the
front
now
there
was
a
which
was
a
very
favourite
rendezvous
of
the
seamen
belonging
to
the
merchant
vessels
and
to
which
they
were
accustomed
to
retreat
when
they
heard
that
the
pressgangs
were
out
our
officers
were
aware
of
this
and
were
therefore
indifferent
as
to
the
escape
of
the
men
as
they
knew
that
they
would
all
go
to
that
place
and
confide
in
their
numbers
for
beating
us
off
as
it
was
then
one
they
thought
it
time
to
go
there
we
proceeded
without
any
noise
but
they
had
people
on
the
and
as
soon
as
we
turned
the
corner
of
the
lane
the
alarm
was
given
i
was
afraid
that
they
would
all
run
away
and
we
should
lose
them
but
on
the
contrary
they
mustered
very
strong
on
that
night
and
had
resolved
to
give
fight
the
men
remained
in
the
house
but
an
advanced
guard
of
about
thirty
of
their
wives
saluted
us
with
a
shower
of
stones
and
mud
some
of
our
sailors
were
hurt
but
they
did
not
appear
to
mind
what
the
women
did
they
rushed
on
and
then
they
were
attacked
by
the
women
with
their
fists
and
nails
notwithstanding
this
the
sailors
only
laughed
pushing
the
women
on
one
side
and
saying
be
quiet
poll
do
be
foolish
molly
out
of
the
way
sukey
we
come
to
take
away
your
fancy
man
with
expressions
of
that
sort
although
the
blood
trickled
down
many
of
their
faces
from
the
way
in
which
they
had
been
clawed
thus
we
attempted
to
force
our
way
through
them
but
i
had
a
very
narrow
escape
even
in
this
instance
a
woman
seized
me
by
the
arm
and
pulled
me
towards
her
had
it
not
been
for
one
of
the
i
should
have
been
separated
from
my
party
but
just
as
they
dragged
me
away
she
caught
hold
of
me
by
the
leg
and
stopped
them
clap
on
here
peg
cried
the
woman
to
another
and
let
have
this
little
midshipmite
i
wants
a
baby
to
dry
nurse
two
more
women
came
to
her
assistance
catching
hold
of
my
other
arm
and
they
would
have
dragged
me
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
had
he
not
called
out
for
more
help
on
his
side
upon
which
two
of
the
seamen
laid
hold
of
my
other
leg
and
there
was
such
a
tussle
all
at
my
expense
such
pulling
and
hauling
sometimes
the
women
gained
an
inch
or
two
of
me
then
the
sailors
got
it
back
again
at
one
moment
i
thought
it
was
all
over
with
me
and
in
the
next
i
was
with
my
own
men
pull
devil
pull
baker
cried
the
women
and
then
they
laughed
although
i
did
not
i
can
assure
you
for
i
really
think
that
i
was
pulled
out
an
inch
taller
and
my
knees
and
shoulders
pained
me
very
much
indeed
at
last
the
women
laughed
so
much
that
they
could
not
hold
on
so
i
was
dragged
into
the
middle
of
our
own
sailors
where
i
took
care
to
remain
and
after
a
little
more
squeezing
and
fighting
was
carried
by
the
crowd
into
the
house
the
seamen
of
the
merchant
ships
had
armed
themselves
with
bludgeons
and
other
weapons
and
had
taken
a
position
on
the
tables
they
were
more
than
two
to
one
against
us
and
there
was
a
dreadful
fight
as
their
resistance
was
very
desperate
our
sailors
were
obliged
to
use
their
cutlasses
and
for
a
few
minutes
i
was
quite
bewildered
with
the
shouting
and
swearing
pushing
and
scuffling
collaring
and
fighting
together
with
the
dust
raised
up
which
not
only
blinded
but
nearly
choked
me
by
the
time
that
my
breath
was
nearly
squeezed
out
of
my
body
our
sailors
got
the
best
of
it
which
the
landlady
and
women
of
the
house
perceiving
they
put
out
all
the
lights
so
that
i
could
not
tell
where
i
was
but
our
sailors
had
every
one
seized
his
man
and
contrived
to
haul
him
out
of
the
street
door
where
they
were
collected
together
and
secured
now
again
i
was
in
great
difficulty
i
had
been
knocked
down
and
trod
upon
and
when
i
did
contrive
to
get
up
again
i
did
not
know
the
direction
in
which
the
door
lay
i
felt
about
by
the
wall
and
at
last
came
to
a
door
for
the
room
was
at
that
time
nearly
empty
the
women
having
followed
the
men
out
of
the
house
i
opened
it
and
found
that
it
was
not
the
right
one
but
led
into
a
little
side
parlour
where
there
was
a
fire
but
no
lights
i
had
just
discovered
my
mistake
and
was
about
to
retreat
when
i
was
shoved
in
from
behind
and
the
key
turned
upon
me
there
i
was
all
alone
and
i
must
acknowledge
very
much
frightened
as
i
thought
that
the
vengeance
of
the
women
would
be
wreaked
upon
me
i
considered
that
my
death
was
certain
and
that
like
the
man
orpheus
i
had
read
of
in
my
books
i
should
be
torn
to
pieces
by
these
bacchanals
however
i
reflected
that
i
was
an
officer
in
his
majesty
service
and
that
it
was
my
duty
if
necessary
to
sacrifice
my
life
for
my
king
and
country
i
thought
of
my
poor
mother
but
as
it
made
me
unhappy
i
tried
to
forget
her
and
call
to
my
memory
all
i
had
read
of
the
fortitude
and
courage
of
various
brave
men
when
death
stared
them
in
the
face
i
peeped
through
the
and
perceived
that
the
candles
were
and
that
there
were
only
women
in
the
room
who
were
talking
all
at
once
and
not
thinking
about
me
but
in
a
minute
or
two
a
woman
came
in
from
the
street
with
her
long
black
hair
hanging
about
her
shoulders
and
her
cap
in
her
hand
well
cried
she
they
nabbed
my
husband
but
i
be
dished
if
i
boxed
up
the
midshipmite
in
that
parlour
and
he
shall
take
his
place
i
thought
i
should
have
died
when
i
looked
at
the
woman
and
perceived
her
coming
up
to
the
door
followed
by
some
others
to
unlock
it
as
the
door
opened
i
drew
my
dirk
resolving
to
die
like
an
officer
and
as
they
advanced
i
retreated
to
a
corner
brandishing
my
dirk
without
saying
a
word
vell
cried
the
woman
who
had
made
me
a
prisoner
i
do
declare
i
likes
to
see
a
puddle
in
a
storm
only
look
at
the
little
showing
fight
come
my
lovey
you
belongs
to
me
never
exclaimed
i
with
indignation
keep
off
i
shall
do
you
mischief
and
i
raised
my
dirk
in
advance
i
am
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
sall
cried
the
odious
woman
fetch
a
mop
and
a
pail
of
dirty
water
and
i
trundle
that
dirk
out
of
his
fist
no
no
replied
another
rather
young
woman
leave
him
to
me
do
hurt
him
he
really
is
a
very
nice
little
man
what
your
name
my
dear
peter
simple
is
my
name
replied
i
and
i
am
a
king
officer
so
be
careful
what
you
are
about
do
be
afraid
peter
nobody
shall
hurt
you
but
you
must
not
draw
your
dirk
before
ladies
that
not
like
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
so
put
up
your
dirk
that
a
good
boy
i
will
not
replied
i
unless
you
promise
me
that
i
shall
go
away
unmolested
i
do
promise
you
that
you
shall
upon
my
word
peter
upon
my
honour
will
that
content
you
yes
replied
i
if
every
one
else
will
promise
the
same
upon
our
honours
they
all
cried
together
upon
which
i
was
satisfied
and
putting
my
dirk
into
its
sheath
was
about
to
quit
the
room
stop
peter
said
the
young
woman
who
had
taken
my
part
i
must
have
a
kiss
before
you
go
and
so
must
i
and
so
must
we
all
cried
the
other
women
i
was
very
much
shocked
and
attempted
to
draw
my
dirk
again
but
they
had
closed
in
with
me
and
prevented
me
recollect
your
honour
cried
i
to
the
young
woman
as
i
struggled
my
honour
lord
bless
you
peter
the
less
we
say
about
that
the
better
but
you
promised
that
i
should
go
away
quietly
said
i
appealing
to
them
well
and
so
you
shall
but
recollect
peter
that
you
are
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
you
surely
would
not
be
so
shabby
as
to
go
away
without
treating
us
what
money
have
you
got
in
your
pocket
and
without
giving
me
time
to
answer
she
felt
in
my
pocket
and
pulled
out
my
purse
which
she
opened
why
peter
you
are
as
rich
as
a
jew
said
she
as
they
counted
thirty
shillings
on
the
table
now
what
shall
we
have
anything
you
please
said
i
provided
that
you
will
let
me
go
well
then
it
shall
be
a
gallon
of
gin
sall
call
mrs
flanagan
mrs
flanagan
we
want
a
gallon
of
gin
and
clean
glasses
mrs
flanagan
received
the
major
part
of
my
money
and
in
a
minute
returned
with
the
gin
and
now
peter
my
cove
let
all
draw
round
the
table
and
make
ourselves
cosy
o
no
replied
i
take
my
money
drink
the
gin
but
pray
let
me
go
but
they
would
listen
to
me
then
i
was
obliged
to
sit
down
with
them
the
gin
was
poured
out
and
they
made
me
drink
a
glass
which
nearly
choked
me
it
had
however
one
good
effect
it
gave
me
courage
and
in
a
minute
or
two
i
felt
as
if
i
could
fight
them
all
the
door
of
the
room
was
on
the
same
side
as
the
and
i
perceived
that
the
poker
was
between
the
bars
and
red
hot
i
complained
that
i
was
cold
although
i
was
in
a
burning
fever
and
they
allowed
me
to
get
up
to
warm
my
hands
as
soon
as
i
reached
the
i
snatched
out
the
poker
and
brandishing
it
over
my
head
made
for
the
door
they
all
jumped
up
to
detain
me
but
i
made
a
poke
at
the
foremost
which
made
her
run
back
with
a
shriek
i
do
believe
that
i
burnt
her
nose
i
seized
my
opportunity
and
escaped
into
the
street
whirling
the
poker
round
my
head
while
all
the
women
followed
hooting
and
shouting
after
me
i
never
stopped
running
and
whirling
my
poker
until
i
was
reeking
with
perspiration
and
the
poker
was
quite
cold
then
i
looked
back
and
found
that
i
was
alone
it
was
very
dark
every
house
was
shut
up
and
not
a
light
to
be
seen
anywhere
i
stopped
at
the
corner
not
knowing
where
i
was
or
what
i
was
to
do
i
felt
very
miserable
indeed
and
was
reflecting
on
my
wisest
plan
when
who
should
turn
the
corner
but
one
of
the
who
had
been
left
on
shore
by
accident
i
knew
him
by
his
and
straw
hat
to
be
one
of
our
men
and
i
was
delighted
to
see
him
i
told
him
what
had
happened
and
he
replied
that
he
was
going
to
a
house
where
the
people
knew
him
and
would
let
him
in
when
we
arrived
there
the
people
of
the
house
were
very
civil
the
landlady
made
us
some
purl
which
the
ordered
and
which
i
thought
very
good
indeed
after
we
had
finished
the
jug
we
both
fell
asleep
in
our
chairs
i
did
not
awaken
until
i
was
roused
by
the
at
past
seven
when
we
took
a
wherry
and
went
off
to
the
ship
chapter
xi
takes
me
under
his
protection
the
ship
company
are
paid
so
are
the
the
jews
and
the
emancipationist
after
a
fashion
we
go
to
sea
cure
for
one
pill
of
the
doctor
more
than
a
dose
when
we
arrived
i
reported
myself
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
told
him
the
whole
story
of
the
manner
in
which
i
had
been
treated
showing
him
the
poker
which
i
brought
on
board
with
me
he
heard
me
very
patiently
and
then
said
well
mr
simple
you
may
be
the
greatest
fool
of
your
family
for
all
i
know
to
the
contrary
but
never
pretend
to
be
a
fool
with
me
that
poker
proves
the
contrary
and
if
your
wit
can
serve
you
upon
your
own
emergency
i
expect
that
it
will
be
employed
for
the
benefit
of
the
service
he
then
sent
for
and
gave
him
a
lecture
for
allowing
me
to
go
with
the
pressgang
pointing
out
what
was
very
true
that
i
could
have
been
of
no
service
and
might
have
met
with
a
serious
accident
i
went
down
on
the
main
deck
and
came
to
me
peter
said
he
i
have
been
jawed
for
letting
you
go
so
it
is
but
fair
that
you
should
be
thrashed
for
having
asked
me
i
wished
to
argue
the
point
but
he
cut
all
argument
short
by
kicking
me
down
the
hatchway
and
thus
ended
my
zealous
attempt
to
procure
seamen
for
his
majesty
service
at
last
the
frigate
was
full
manned
and
as
we
had
received
drafts
of
men
from
other
ships
we
were
ordered
to
be
paid
previously
to
our
going
to
sea
the
people
on
shore
always
find
out
when
a
ship
is
to
be
paid
and
very
early
in
the
morning
we
were
surrounded
with
wherries
laden
with
jews
and
other
people
some
requesting
admittance
to
sell
their
goods
others
to
get
paid
for
what
they
had
allowed
the
sailors
to
take
up
upon
credit
but
the
first
lieutenant
would
not
allow
any
of
them
to
come
on
board
until
after
the
ship
was
paid
although
they
were
so
urgent
that
he
was
forced
to
place
sentries
in
the
chains
with
cold
shot
to
stave
the
boats
if
they
came
alongside
i
was
standing
at
the
gangway
looking
at
the
crowd
of
boats
when
a
fellow
in
one
of
the
wherries
said
to
me
i
say
sir
let
me
slip
in
at
the
port
and
i
have
a
very
nice
present
to
make
you
and
he
displayed
a
gold
seal
which
he
held
up
to
me
i
immediately
ordered
the
sentry
to
keep
him
further
off
for
i
was
very
much
affronted
at
his
supposing
me
capable
of
being
bribed
to
disobey
my
orders
about
eleven
the
dockyard
boat
with
all
the
and
the
cashier
with
his
chest
of
money
came
on
board
and
was
shown
into
the
where
the
captain
attended
the
the
men
were
called
in
one
by
one
and
as
the
amount
of
the
wages
due
had
been
previously
calculated
they
were
paid
very
fast
the
money
was
always
received
in
their
hats
after
it
had
been
counted
out
in
the
presence
of
the
officers
and
captain
outside
the
cabin
door
there
stood
a
tall
man
in
black
with
hair
straight
combed
who
had
obtained
an
order
from
the
port
admiral
to
be
permitted
to
come
on
board
he
attacked
every
sailor
as
he
came
out
with
his
money
in
his
hat
for
a
subscription
to
emancipate
the
slaves
in
the
west
indies
but
the
sailors
would
not
give
him
anything
swearing
that
the
niggers
were
better
off
than
they
were
for
they
did
not
work
harder
by
day
and
had
no
watch
and
watch
to
keep
during
the
night
sarvitude
is
sarvitude
all
over
the
world
my
old
psalmsinger
replied
one
they
sarve
their
masters
as
in
duty
bound
we
sarve
the
king
he
ca
do
without
us
and
he
never
axes
our
leave
but
helps
himself
yes
replied
the
gentleman
but
slavery
is
a
very
different
thing
ca
say
that
i
see
any
difference
do
you
bill
not
i
and
i
suppose
as
if
they
did
like
it
they
run
away
run
away
poor
creatures
said
the
black
gentleman
why
if
they
did
they
would
be
flogged
flogged
heh
well
and
if
we
run
away
we
are
to
be
hanged
the
nigger
better
off
nor
we
he
tom
then
the
purser
steward
came
out
he
was
what
they
call
a
bit
of
a
lawyer
that
is
had
received
more
education
than
the
seamen
in
general
i
trust
sir
said
the
man
in
black
that
you
will
contribute
something
not
i
my
hearty
i
owe
every
farthing
of
my
money
and
more
too
afraid
still
sir
a
small
trifle
why
what
an
infernal
rascal
you
must
be
to
ask
a
man
to
give
away
what
is
not
his
own
property
did
i
not
tell
you
that
i
owed
it
all
there
an
old
proverb
be
just
before
you
generous
now
it
my
opinion
that
you
are
a
methodistical
blackguard
and
if
any
one
is
such
a
fool
as
to
give
you
money
you
will
keep
it
for
yourself
when
the
man
found
that
he
could
obtain
nothing
at
the
door
he
went
down
on
the
lower
deck
in
which
he
did
not
act
very
wisely
for
now
that
the
men
were
paid
the
boats
were
permitted
to
come
alongside
and
so
much
spirits
were
smuggled
in
that
most
of
the
seamen
were
more
or
less
intoxicated
as
soon
as
he
went
below
he
commenced
distributing
prints
of
a
black
man
kneeling
in
chains
and
saying
am
not
i
your
brother
some
of
the
men
laughed
and
swore
that
they
would
paste
their
brother
up
in
the
mess
to
say
prayers
for
the
ship
company
but
others
were
very
angry
and
abused
him
at
last
one
man
who
was
tipsy
came
up
to
him
do
you
pretend
for
to
insinivate
that
this
crying
black
thief
is
my
brother
to
be
sure
i
do
replied
the
methodist
then
take
that
for
your
infernal
lie
said
the
sailor
hitting
him
in
the
face
right
and
left
and
knocking
the
man
down
into
the
cable
tier
from
whence
he
climbed
up
and
made
his
escape
out
of
the
frigate
as
soon
as
he
was
able
the
ship
was
now
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
uproar
there
were
jews
trying
to
sell
clothes
or
to
obtain
money
for
clothes
which
they
had
sold
and
showing
their
long
bills
and
demanding
or
coaxing
for
payment
other
people
from
the
shore
with
hundreds
of
small
debts
and
the
sailors
wives
sticking
close
to
them
and
disputing
every
bill
presented
as
an
extortion
or
a
robbery
there
was
such
bawling
and
threatening
laughing
and
crying
for
the
women
were
all
to
quit
the
ship
before
sunset
at
one
moment
a
jew
was
upset
and
all
his
hamper
of
clothes
tossed
into
the
hold
at
another
a
sailor
was
seen
hunting
everywhere
for
a
jew
who
had
cheated
him
all
squabbling
or
skylarking
and
many
of
them
very
drunk
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
sailors
had
rather
a
difficult
point
to
settle
they
had
three
claimants
upon
them
the
jew
for
clothes
the
for
their
mess
in
harbour
and
their
wives
for
their
support
during
their
absence
and
the
money
which
they
received
was
generally
speaking
not
more
than
sufficient
to
meet
one
of
the
demands
as
it
may
be
supposed
the
women
had
the
best
of
it
the
others
were
paid
a
trifle
and
promised
the
remainder
when
they
came
back
from
their
cruise
and
although
as
the
case
stood
then
it
might
appear
that
two
of
the
parties
were
yet
in
the
long
run
they
were
more
than
indemnified
for
their
charges
were
so
extravagant
that
if
of
their
bills
were
paid
there
would
still
remain
a
profit
about
five
the
orders
were
given
for
the
ship
to
be
cleared
all
disputed
points
were
settled
by
the
sergeant
of
marines
with
a
party
who
divided
their
antagonists
from
the
jews
and
every
description
of
persons
not
belonging
to
the
ship
whether
male
or
female
was
dismissed
over
the
side
the
hammocks
were
piped
down
those
who
were
intoxicated
were
put
to
bed
and
the
ship
was
once
more
quiet
nobody
was
punished
for
having
been
tipsy
as
is
considered
on
board
a
as
the
of
all
incorrect
behaviour
and
from
that
day
the
sailors
turn
over
a
new
leaf
for
although
some
latitude
is
permitted
and
the
seamen
are
seldom
flogged
in
harbour
yet
the
moment
that
the
anchor
is
at
the
bows
strict
discipline
is
exacted
and
intoxication
must
no
longer
hope
to
be
forgiven
the
next
day
everything
was
prepared
for
sea
and
no
leave
was
permitted
to
the
officers
stock
of
every
kind
was
brought
on
board
and
the
large
boats
hoisted
and
secured
on
the
morning
after
at
daylight
a
signal
from
the
in
harbour
was
made
for
us
to
unmoor
our
orders
had
come
down
to
cruise
in
the
bay
of
biscay
the
captain
came
on
board
the
anchor
weighed
and
we
ran
through
the
needles
with
a
fine
breeze
i
admired
the
scenery
of
the
isle
of
wight
looked
with
admiration
at
alum
bay
was
astonished
at
the
needle
rocks
and
then
felt
so
very
ill
that
i
went
down
below
what
occurred
for
the
next
six
days
i
can
not
tell
i
thought
that
i
should
die
every
moment
and
lay
in
my
hammock
or
on
the
chests
for
the
whole
of
that
time
incapable
of
eating
drinking
or
walking
about
came
to
me
on
the
seventh
morning
and
said
that
if
i
did
not
exert
myself
i
never
should
get
well
that
he
was
very
fond
of
me
and
had
taken
me
under
his
protection
and
to
prove
his
regard
he
would
do
for
me
what
he
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
do
for
any
other
youngster
in
the
ship
which
was
to
give
me
a
good
basting
which
was
a
sovereign
remedy
for
he
suited
the
action
to
the
word
and
drubbed
me
on
the
ribs
without
mercy
until
i
thought
the
breath
was
out
of
my
body
and
then
he
took
out
a
rope
end
and
thrashed
me
until
i
obeyed
his
orders
to
go
on
deck
immediately
before
he
came
to
me
i
could
never
have
believed
it
possible
that
i
could
have
obeyed
him
but
somehow
or
other
i
did
contrive
to
crawl
up
the
ladder
to
the
where
i
sat
down
on
the
and
cried
bitterly
what
would
i
have
given
to
have
been
at
home
again
it
was
not
my
fault
that
i
was
the
greatest
fool
in
the
family
yet
how
was
i
punished
for
it
if
this
was
kindness
from
what
had
i
to
expect
from
those
who
were
not
partial
to
me
but
by
degrees
i
recovered
myself
and
certainly
felt
a
great
deal
better
and
that
night
i
slept
very
soundly
the
next
morning
came
to
me
again
it
a
nasty
slow
fever
that
my
peter
and
we
must
drive
it
out
of
you
and
then
he
commenced
a
repetition
of
yesterday
remedy
until
i
was
almost
a
jelly
whether
the
fear
of
being
thrashed
drove
away
my
or
whatever
might
be
the
real
cause
of
it
i
do
not
know
but
this
is
certain
that
i
felt
no
more
of
it
after
the
second
beating
and
the
next
morning
when
i
awoke
i
was
very
hungry
i
hastened
to
dress
myself
before
came
to
me
and
did
not
see
him
until
we
met
at
breakfast
pater
said
he
let
me
feel
your
pulse
oh
no
replied
i
indeed
i
quite
well
quite
well
can
you
eat
biscuit
and
salt
butter
yes
i
can
and
a
piece
of
fat
pork
yes
that
i
can
it
thanks
to
me
then
pater
replied
he
so
you
have
no
more
of
my
medicine
until
you
fall
sick
again
i
hope
not
replied
i
for
it
was
not
very
pleasant
pleasant
you
simple
simple
when
did
you
ever
hear
of
physic
being
pleasant
unless
a
man
prescribe
for
himself
i
suppose
you
be
after
lollipops
for
the
yellow
fever
live
and
larn
boy
and
thank
heaven
that
you
found
somebody
who
loves
you
well
enough
to
baste
you
when
it
good
for
your
health
i
replied
that
i
certainly
hoped
that
much
as
i
felt
obliged
to
him
i
should
not
require
any
more
proofs
of
his
regard
any
more
such
proofs
you
mean
pater
but
let
me
tell
you
that
they
were
sincere
proofs
for
since
you
been
ill
i
been
eating
your
pork
and
drinking
your
grog
which
latter
ca
be
too
plentiful
in
the
bay
of
biscay
and
now
that
i
cured
you
you
be
tucking
all
that
into
your
own
little
breadbasket
so
that
i
no
gainer
and
i
think
that
you
may
be
convinced
that
you
never
had
or
will
have
two
more
disinterested
thumpings
in
all
your
born
days
however
you
very
welcome
so
say
no
more
about
it
i
held
my
tongue
and
ate
a
very
hearty
breakfast
from
that
day
i
returned
to
my
duty
and
was
put
into
the
same
watch
with
who
spoke
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
told
him
that
he
had
taken
me
under
his
charge
chapter
xii
new
theory
of
mr
muddle
remarkable
for
having
no
end
to
it
novel
practice
of
mr
chucks
commences
his
history
there
were
giants
in
those
days
i
bring
up
the
master
as
i
have
already
mentioned
sufficient
of
the
captain
and
the
first
lieutenant
to
enable
the
reader
to
gain
an
insight
into
their
characters
i
shall
now
mention
two
very
odd
personages
who
were
my
shipmates
the
carpenter
and
the
boatswain
the
carpenter
whose
name
was
muddle
used
to
go
by
the
appellation
of
philosopher
chips
not
that
he
followed
any
particular
school
but
had
formed
a
theory
of
his
own
from
which
he
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
this
was
that
the
universe
had
its
cycle
of
events
turned
round
so
that
in
a
certain
period
of
time
everything
was
to
happen
over
again
i
never
could
make
him
explain
upon
what
data
his
calculations
were
founded
he
said
that
if
he
explained
it
i
was
too
young
to
comprehend
it
but
the
fact
was
this
that
in
years
everything
that
was
going
on
now
would
be
going
on
again
with
the
same
people
as
were
existing
at
this
present
time
he
very
seldom
ventured
to
make
the
remark
to
captain
savage
but
to
the
first
lieutenant
he
did
very
often
i
been
as
close
to
it
as
possible
sir
i
do
assure
you
although
you
find
fault
but
years
ago
you
were
first
lieutenant
of
this
ship
and
i
was
carpenter
although
we
recollect
nothing
about
it
and
years
hence
we
shall
both
be
standing
by
this
boat
talking
about
the
repairs
as
we
are
now
i
do
not
doubt
it
mr
muddle
replied
the
first
lieutenant
i
dare
say
that
it
is
all
very
true
but
the
repairs
must
be
finished
this
night
and
years
hence
you
will
have
the
order
just
as
positive
as
you
have
it
now
so
let
it
be
done
this
theory
made
him
very
indifferent
as
to
danger
or
indeed
as
to
anything
it
was
of
no
consequence
the
affair
took
its
station
in
the
course
of
time
it
had
happened
at
the
above
period
and
would
happen
again
fate
was
fate
but
the
boatswain
was
a
more
amusing
personage
he
was
considered
to
be
the
that
is
the
most
active
and
severe
boatswain
in
the
service
he
went
by
the
name
of
gentleman
chucks
the
latter
was
his
surname
he
appeared
to
have
received
half
an
education
sometimes
his
language
was
for
a
few
sentences
remarkably
well
chosen
but
all
of
a
sudden
he
would
break
down
at
a
hard
word
but
i
shall
be
able
to
let
the
reader
into
more
of
his
history
as
i
go
on
with
my
adventures
he
had
a
very
handsome
person
inclined
to
be
stout
keen
eyes
and
hair
curling
in
ringlets
he
held
his
head
up
and
strutted
as
he
walked
he
declared
that
an
officer
should
look
like
an
officer
and
himself
accordingly
in
his
person
he
was
very
clean
wore
rings
on
his
great
fingers
and
a
large
frill
to
his
bosom
which
stuck
out
like
the
back
fin
of
a
perch
and
the
collar
of
his
shirt
was
always
pulled
up
to
a
level
with
his
he
never
appeared
on
deck
without
his
persuader
which
was
three
rattans
twisted
into
one
like
a
cable
sometimes
he
called
it
his
order
of
the
bath
or
his
in
uno
and
this
persuader
was
seldom
idle
he
attempted
to
be
very
polite
even
when
addressing
the
common
seamen
and
certainly
he
always
commenced
his
observations
to
them
in
a
very
gracious
manner
but
as
he
continued
he
became
less
choice
in
his
phraseology
said
that
his
speeches
were
like
the
sin
of
the
poet
very
fair
at
the
upper
part
of
them
but
shocking
at
the
lower
extremities
as
a
specimen
of
them
he
would
say
to
the
man
on
the
forecastle
allow
me
to
observe
my
dear
man
in
the
most
delicate
way
in
the
world
that
you
are
spilling
that
tar
upon
the
deck
a
deck
sir
if
i
may
venture
to
make
the
observation
i
had
the
duty
of
seeing
holystoned
this
morning
you
understand
me
sir
you
have
defiled
his
majesty
forecastle
i
must
do
my
duty
sir
if
you
neglect
yours
so
take
that
and
that
and
that
thrashing
the
man
with
his
rattan
you
d
d
son
of
a
do
it
again
d
n
your
eyes
and
cut
your
liver
out
i
remember
one
of
the
ship
boys
going
forward
with
a
kid
of
dirty
water
to
empty
in
the
head
without
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
hat
as
he
passed
the
boatswain
stop
my
little
friend
said
the
boatswain
pulling
out
his
frill
and
raising
up
both
sides
of
his
are
you
aware
sir
of
my
rank
and
station
in
society
yes
sir
replied
the
boy
trembling
and
eyeing
the
rattan
oh
you
are
replied
mr
chucks
had
you
not
been
aware
of
it
i
should
have
considered
a
gentle
correction
necessary
that
you
might
have
avoided
such
an
error
in
future
but
as
you
aware
of
it
why
then
d
n
you
you
have
no
excuse
so
take
that
and
that
you
yelping
abortion
i
really
beg
your
pardon
mr
simple
said
he
to
me
as
the
boy
went
howling
forward
for
i
was
walking
with
him
at
the
time
but
really
the
service
makes
brutes
of
us
all
it
is
hard
to
sacrifice
our
health
our
night
rest
and
our
comforts
but
still
more
so
that
in
my
responsible
situation
i
am
obliged
too
often
to
sacrifice
my
gentility
the
master
was
the
officer
who
had
charge
of
the
watch
to
which
i
was
stationed
he
was
a
very
rough
sailor
who
had
been
brought
up
in
the
merchant
service
not
much
of
a
gentleman
in
his
appearance
very
and
very
fond
of
grog
he
always
quarrelled
with
the
boatswain
and
declared
that
the
service
was
going
to
the
devil
now
that
warrant
officers
put
on
white
shirts
and
wore
frills
to
them
but
the
boatswain
did
not
care
for
him
he
knew
his
duty
he
did
his
duty
and
if
the
captain
was
satisfied
he
said
that
the
whole
ship
company
might
grumble
as
for
the
master
he
said
the
man
was
very
well
but
having
been
brought
up
in
a
collier
he
could
not
be
expected
to
be
very
refined
in
fact
he
observed
pulling
up
his
it
was
impossible
to
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
the
master
was
very
kind
to
me
and
used
to
send
me
down
to
my
hammock
before
my
watch
was
half
over
until
that
time
i
walked
the
deck
with
who
was
a
very
pleasant
companion
and
taught
me
everything
that
he
could
connected
with
my
profession
one
night
when
he
had
the
middle
watch
i
told
him
i
should
like
very
much
if
he
would
give
me
the
history
of
his
life
that
i
will
my
honey
replied
he
all
that
i
can
remember
of
it
though
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
i
forgotten
the
best
part
of
it
it
now
within
five
minutes
of
two
bells
so
we
heave
the
log
and
mark
the
board
and
then
i
spin
you
a
yarn
which
will
keep
us
both
from
going
to
sleep
reported
the
rate
of
sailing
to
the
master
marked
it
down
on
the
and
then
returned
so
now
my
boy
i
come
to
an
anchor
on
the
topsail
halyard
rack
and
you
may
squeeze
your
little
carcass
under
my
lee
and
then
i
tell
you
all
about
it
first
and
foremost
you
must
know
that
i
am
descended
from
the
great
borru
who
was
king
in
his
time
as
the
great
fingal
was
before
him
of
course
you
heard
of
fingal
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
did
replied
i
never
heard
of
fingal
murder
where
must
you
have
been
all
your
life
well
then
to
give
you
some
notion
of
fingal
i
will
first
tell
you
how
fingal
bothered
the
great
scotch
giant
and
then
i
go
on
with
my
own
story
fingal
you
must
know
was
a
giant
himself
and
no
fool
of
one
and
any
one
that
affronted
him
was
as
sure
of
a
bating
as
i
am
to
keep
the
middle
watch
but
there
was
a
giant
in
scotland
as
tall
as
the
mainmast
more
or
less
as
we
say
when
we
quite
sure
as
it
saves
telling
more
lies
than
there
occasion
for
well
this
scotch
giant
heard
of
fingal
and
how
he
had
beaten
everybody
and
he
said
is
this
fingal
by
jasus
says
he
in
scotch
just
walk
over
and
see
what
he
made
of
so
he
walked
across
the
irish
channel
and
landed
within
of
belfast
but
whether
he
was
out
of
his
depth
or
not
i
ca
tell
although
i
suspect
that
he
was
not
when
fingal
heard
that
this
great
chap
was
coming
over
he
was
in
a
devil
of
a
fright
for
they
told
him
that
the
scotchman
was
taller
by
a
few
feet
or
so
giants
you
know
measure
by
feet
and
bother
themselves
about
the
inches
as
we
little
devils
are
obliged
to
do
so
fingal
kept
a
sharp
for
the
scotchman
and
one
fine
morning
there
he
was
sure
enough
coming
up
the
hill
to
house
if
fingal
was
afraid
before
he
had
more
reason
to
be
afraid
when
he
saw
the
fellow
for
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
the
monument
upon
a
voyage
of
discovery
so
fingal
ran
into
his
house
and
called
to
his
wife
shaya
vourneen
says
he
quick
now
there
that
big
bully
of
a
scotchman
coming
up
the
hill
kiver
me
up
with
the
blankets
and
if
he
asks
who
is
in
bed
tell
him
it
the
child
so
fingal
laid
down
on
the
bed
and
his
wife
had
just
time
to
cover
him
up
when
in
comes
the
scotchman
and
though
he
stooped
low
he
broke
his
head
against
the
portal
that
baste
fingal
says
he
rubbing
his
forehead
him
to
me
that
i
may
give
him
a
bating
whisht
cries
shaya
wake
the
babby
and
then
him
that
you
talk
of
bating
will
be
the
death
of
you
if
he
comes
in
that
the
babby
cried
the
scotchman
with
surprise
looking
at
the
great
carcass
muffled
up
in
the
blankets
it
is
replied
shaya
babby
too
so
do
you
wake
him
or
fingal
will
twist
your
neck
in
a
minute
the
cross
of
st
andrew
replied
the
giant
it
time
for
me
to
be
off
for
if
that
his
babby
i
be
but
a
mouthful
to
the
fellow
himself
good
morning
to
ye
so
the
scotch
giant
ran
out
of
the
house
and
never
stopped
to
eat
or
drink
until
he
got
back
to
his
own
hills
foreby
he
was
nearly
drowned
in
having
mistaken
his
passage
across
the
channel
in
his
great
hurry
then
fingal
got
up
and
laughed
as
well
he
might
at
his
own
and
so
ends
my
story
about
fingal
and
now
i
begin
about
myself
as
i
said
before
i
am
descended
from
the
great
who
was
a
king
in
his
time
but
that
time
past
i
suppose
as
the
world
turns
round
my
children
posterity
may
be
kings
again
although
there
seems
but
little
chance
of
it
just
now
but
there
ups
and
downs
on
a
grand
scale
as
well
as
in
a
man
own
history
and
the
wheel
of
fortune
keeps
turning
for
the
comfort
of
those
who
are
at
the
lowest
spoke
as
i
may
be
just
now
to
cut
the
story
a
little
shorter
i
skip
down
to
my
who
lived
like
a
real
gentleman
as
he
was
upon
his
ten
thousand
a
year
at
last
he
died
and
eight
thousand
of
the
ten
was
buried
with
him
my
grandfather
followed
his
father
all
in
good
course
of
time
and
only
left
my
father
about
one
hundred
acres
of
bog
to
keep
up
the
dignity
of
the
family
i
am
the
youngest
of
ten
and
devil
a
copper
have
i
but
my
pay
or
am
i
likely
to
have
you
may
talk
about
but
a
more
family
than
mine
was
never
in
existence
for
here
am
i
with
pounds
and
a
of
a
day
and
find
myself
when
my
great
ancestor
did
just
what
he
pleased
with
all
ireland
and
everybody
in
it
but
this
is
all
nothing
except
to
prove
satisfactorily
that
i
am
not
worth
a
skillagalee
and
that
is
the
reason
which
induces
me
to
condescend
to
serve
his
majesty
father
the
priest
who
lived
with
my
father
taught
me
the
elements
as
they
call
them
i
thought
i
had
enough
of
the
elements
then
but
i
seen
a
deal
more
of
them
since
says
my
father
to
me
one
day
do
you
mane
to
do
get
my
dinner
sure
replied
i
for
i
was
not
a
little
hungry
so
you
shall
my
vourneen
replied
my
father
in
future
you
must
do
something
to
get
your
own
dinner
there
not
praties
enow
for
the
whole
of
ye
will
you
go
to
the
just
step
down
and
look
at
it
says
i
for
we
lived
but
sixteen
irish
miles
from
the
coast
so
when
i
had
finished
my
meal
which
did
not
take
long
for
want
of
ammunition
i
trotted
down
to
the
cove
to
see
what
a
ship
might
be
like
and
i
happened
upon
a
large
one
sure
enough
for
there
lay
a
with
an
admiral
flag
at
the
fore
be
you
be
so
civil
as
to
tell
me
what
ship
that
is
said
i
to
a
sailor
on
the
pier
the
queen
charlotte
replied
he
one
hundred
and
twenty
guns
now
when
i
looked
at
her
size
and
compared
her
with
all
the
little
smacks
and
hoys
lying
about
her
i
very
naturally
asked
how
old
she
was
he
replied
that
she
was
no
more
than
three
years
old
three
years
old
thought
i
to
myself
a
fine
vessel
you
be
when
you
come
of
age
if
you
grow
at
that
rate
you
be
as
tall
as
the
top
of
bencrow
that
a
mountain
we
have
in
our
parts
you
see
peter
i
was
a
fool
at
that
time
just
as
you
are
now
but
when
you
had
as
many
thrashings
as
i
have
had
you
may
chance
to
be
as
clever
i
went
back
to
my
father
and
told
him
all
i
had
seen
and
he
replied
that
if
i
liked
it
i
might
be
a
midshipman
on
board
of
her
with
nine
hundred
men
under
my
command
he
forgot
to
say
how
many
i
should
have
over
me
but
i
found
that
out
afterwards
i
agreed
and
my
father
ordered
his
pony
and
went
to
the
for
he
had
interest
enough
for
that
the
spoke
to
the
admiral
who
was
staying
at
the
palace
and
i
was
ordered
on
board
as
midshipman
my
father
fitted
me
out
pretty
handsomely
telling
all
the
tradesmen
that
their
bills
should
be
paid
with
my
first
and
thus
by
promises
and
blarney
he
got
credit
for
all
i
wanted
at
last
all
was
ready
father
gave
me
his
blessing
and
told
me
that
if
i
died
like
an
he
would
say
a
power
of
masses
for
the
good
of
my
soul
you
never
have
the
trouble
sir
said
i
trouble
a
pleasure
my
dear
boy
replied
he
for
he
was
a
very
polite
man
so
off
i
went
with
my
big
chest
not
quite
so
full
as
it
ought
to
have
been
for
my
mother
cribbed
one
half
of
my
stock
for
my
brothers
and
sisters
hope
to
be
back
again
soon
father
said
i
as
i
took
my
leave
hope
not
my
dear
boy
replied
he
you
provided
for
and
what
more
would
you
have
so
after
a
deal
of
bother
i
was
fairly
on
board
and
i
parted
company
with
my
chest
for
i
stayed
on
deck
and
that
went
down
below
i
stared
about
with
all
my
eyes
for
some
time
when
who
should
be
coming
off
but
the
captain
and
the
officers
were
ordered
on
deck
to
receive
him
i
wanted
to
have
a
quiet
survey
of
him
so
i
took
up
my
station
on
one
of
the
guns
that
i
might
examine
him
at
my
leisure
the
boatswain
whistled
the
marines
presented
arms
and
the
officers
all
took
off
their
hats
as
the
captain
came
on
the
deck
and
then
the
guard
was
dismissed
and
they
all
walked
about
the
deck
as
before
but
i
found
it
very
pleasant
to
be
astride
on
the
gun
so
i
remained
where
i
was
do
you
mane
by
that
you
big
young
scoundrel
says
he
when
he
saw
me
nothing
at
all
i
mane
replied
i
what
do
you
mane
by
calling
an
a
scoundrel
is
he
said
the
captain
to
the
first
lieutenant
who
joined
the
ship
about
an
hour
since
you
know
better
than
to
sit
upon
a
gun
said
the
captain
be
sure
i
do
replied
i
there
anything
better
to
sit
upon
knows
no
better
sir
observed
the
first
lieutenant
he
must
be
taught
replied
the
captain
since
you
have
perched
yourself
on
that
gun
to
please
yourself
you
will
now
continue
there
for
two
hours
to
please
me
do
you
understand
sir
you
ride
on
that
gun
for
two
hours
understand
sir
replied
i
i
am
afraid
that
he
move
without
spurs
although
there
plenty
of
in
him
the
captain
turned
away
and
laughed
as
he
went
into
his
cabin
and
all
the
officers
laughed
and
i
laughed
too
for
i
perceived
no
great
hardship
in
sitting
down
an
hour
or
two
any
more
than
i
do
now
well
i
soon
found
that
like
a
young
bear
all
my
troubles
were
to
come
the
first
month
was
nothing
but
fighting
and
squabbling
with
my
messmates
they
called
me
a
irishman
and
i
was
sure
enough
from
the
constant
thrashings
and
coltings
i
received
from
those
who
were
bigger
and
stronger
than
myself
but
nothing
lasts
for
ever
as
they
discovered
that
whenever
they
found
blows
i
could
find
back
they
got
tired
of
it
and
left
me
and
my
brogue
alone
we
sailed
for
the
toolong
fleet
what
fleet
inquired
i
why
the
toolong
fleet
so
called
i
thought
because
they
remained
too
long
in
harbour
bad
luck
to
them
and
then
we
were
off
cape
devil
a
bit
could
we
see
of
them
except
their
for
i
know
how
many
months
but
i
forgot
to
say
that
i
got
into
another
scrape
just
before
we
left
harbour
it
was
my
watch
when
they
piped
to
dinner
and
i
took
the
liberty
to
run
below
as
my
messmates
had
a
knack
of
forgetting
absent
friends
well
the
captain
came
on
board
and
there
were
no
side
boys
no
side
ropes
and
no
officers
to
receive
him
he
came
on
deck
foaming
with
rage
for
his
dignity
was
hurt
and
he
inquired
who
was
the
midshipman
of
the
watch
said
they
all
a
bit
replied
i
was
my
forenoon
watch
relieved
you
sir
said
the
first
lieutenant
a
soul
sir
replied
i
they
were
all
too
busy
with
their
pork
and
beef
why
did
you
leave
the
deck
without
relief
sir
my
stomach
would
have
had
but
little
relief
if
i
had
remained
the
captain
who
stood
by
said
you
see
those
sir
it
those
little
bits
of
wood
that
you
mane
on
the
top
there
captain
sir
now
just
go
up
there
and
stay
until
i
call
you
down
you
must
be
brought
to
your
senses
young
man
or
you
have
but
little
prospect
in
the
service
an
idea
that
i
have
plenty
of
prospect
when
i
get
up
there
replied
i
it
all
to
please
you
so
up
i
went
as
i
have
many
a
time
since
and
as
you
often
will
peter
just
to
enjoy
the
fresh
air
and
your
own
pleasant
thoughts
all
at
one
and
the
same
time
at
last
i
became
much
more
used
to
the
manners
and
customs
of
people
and
by
the
time
that
i
had
been
fourteen
months
off
cape
i
was
considered
a
very
genteel
young
midshipman
and
my
messmates
that
is
all
that
i
could
thrash
which
did
leave
out
many
had
a
very
great
respect
for
me
the
first
time
that
i
put
my
foot
on
shore
was
at
minorca
and
then
i
put
my
foot
into
it
as
we
say
for
i
was
nearly
killed
for
a
heretic
and
only
saved
by
proving
myself
a
true
catholic
which
proves
that
religion
is
a
great
comfort
in
distress
as
father
used
to
say
several
of
us
went
on
shore
and
having
dined
upon
a
roast
turkey
stuffed
with
for
everything
else
was
cooked
in
oil
and
we
could
not
eat
it
and
having
drunk
as
much
wine
as
would
float
a
we
ordered
donkeys
to
take
a
little
equestrian
exercise
some
went
off
tail
on
end
some
with
their
uppermost
and
then
the
riders
went
off
instead
of
the
donkeys
some
would
go
off
at
all
as
for
mine
he
would
go
and
where
the
devil
do
you
think
he
went
why
into
the
church
where
all
the
people
were
at
mass
the
poor
brute
was
dying
with
thirst
and
smelt
water
as
soon
as
he
was
in
notwithstanding
all
my
tugging
and
hauling
he
ran
his
nose
into
the
font
and
drank
it
all
up
although
i
thought
that
seeing
how
few
christians
have
any
religion
you
could
not
expect
much
from
a
donkey
yet
i
was
very
much
shocked
at
the
sacrilege
and
fearful
of
the
consequences
nor
was
it
without
reason
for
the
people
in
the
church
were
quite
horrified
as
well
they
might
be
for
the
brute
drank
as
much
as
would
have
purified
the
whole
town
of
port
mahon
suburbs
and
all
to
boot
they
rose
up
from
their
knees
and
seized
me
calling
upon
all
the
saints
in
the
calendar
although
i
knew
what
they
meant
not
a
word
of
their
lingo
could
i
speak
to
plead
for
my
life
and
i
was
almost
torn
to
pieces
before
the
priest
came
up
perceiving
the
danger
i
was
in
i
wiped
my
finger
across
the
wet
nose
of
the
donkey
crossed
myself
and
then
went
down
on
my
knees
to
the
priests
crying
out
as
all
good
catholics
do
though
was
no
fault
of
mine
as
i
said
before
for
i
tried
all
i
could
and
tugged
at
the
brute
till
my
strength
was
gone
the
priests
perceived
by
the
manner
in
which
i
crossed
myself
that
i
was
a
good
catholic
and
guessed
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
of
the
donkey
they
ordered
the
crowd
to
be
quiet
and
sent
for
an
interpreter
when
i
explained
the
whole
story
they
gave
me
absolution
for
what
the
donkey
had
done
and
after
that
as
it
was
very
rare
to
meet
an
english
officer
who
was
a
good
christian
i
was
in
great
favour
during
my
stay
at
minorca
and
was
living
in
plenty
paying
for
nothing
and
as
happy
as
a
cricket
so
the
jackass
proved
a
very
good
friend
and
to
reward
him
i
hired
him
every
day
and
galloped
him
all
over
the
island
but
at
last
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
broken
my
leave
for
i
was
so
happy
on
shore
that
i
quite
forgot
that
i
had
only
permission
for
hours
and
i
should
not
have
remembered
it
so
soon
had
it
not
been
for
a
party
of
marines
headed
by
a
sergeant
who
took
me
by
the
collar
and
dragged
me
off
my
donkey
i
was
taken
on
board
and
put
under
an
arrest
for
my
misconduct
now
peter
i
know
anything
more
agreeable
than
being
put
under
an
arrest
nothing
to
do
all
day
but
eat
and
drink
and
please
yourself
only
forbid
to
appear
on
the
the
only
place
that
a
midshipman
wishes
to
avoid
whether
it
was
to
punish
me
more
severely
or
whether
he
forgot
all
about
me
i
ca
tell
but
it
was
nearly
two
months
before
i
was
sent
for
to
the
cabin
and
the
captain
with
a
most
terrible
frown
said
that
he
trusted
that
my
punishment
would
be
a
warning
to
me
and
that
now
i
might
return
to
my
duty
your
honour
said
i
think
that
i
been
punished
enough
yet
am
glad
to
find
that
you
are
so
penitent
but
you
are
forgiven
so
take
care
that
you
do
not
oblige
me
to
put
you
again
in
confinement
so
as
there
was
no
persuading
him
i
was
obliged
to
return
to
my
duty
again
but
i
made
a
resolution
that
i
would
get
into
another
scrape
again
as
soon
as
i
dared
sail
on
the
starboard
bow
cried
the
man
very
well
replied
the
master
mr
where
mr
is
it
me
you
mane
sir
said
walking
up
to
the
master
for
he
had
sat
down
so
long
in
the
rack
that
he
was
wedged
in
and
could
not
get
out
immediately
yes
sir
go
forward
and
see
what
that
vessel
is
aye
aye
sir
said
and
mr
simple
continued
the
master
go
down
and
bring
me
up
my
yes
sir
replied
i
had
no
idea
of
a
and
as
i
observed
that
about
this
time
his
servant
brought
him
up
a
glass
of
grog
i
thought
it
very
lucky
that
i
knew
what
he
meant
take
care
that
you
do
break
it
mr
simple
oh
then
i
all
right
thought
i
he
means
the
tumbler
so
down
i
went
called
up
the
gunroom
steward
and
desired
him
to
give
me
a
glass
of
grog
for
mr
doball
the
steward
tumbled
out
in
his
shirt
mixed
the
grog
and
gave
it
to
me
and
i
carried
it
up
very
carefully
to
the
during
my
absence
the
master
had
called
the
captain
and
in
pursuance
of
his
orders
had
called
the
first
lieutenant
and
when
i
came
up
the
ladder
they
were
both
on
deck
as
i
was
ascending
i
heard
the
master
say
i
have
sent
young
simple
down
for
my
but
he
is
so
long
that
i
suppose
he
has
made
some
mistake
he
but
half
a
fool
that
i
deny
replied
mr
falcon
the
first
lieutenant
just
as
i
put
my
foot
on
the
he
no
fool
perhaps
not
replied
the
master
oh
here
he
is
what
made
you
so
long
mr
simple
where
is
my
here
it
is
sir
replied
i
handing
him
the
tumbler
of
grog
i
told
the
steward
to
make
it
stiff
the
captain
and
the
first
lieutenant
burst
out
into
a
laugh
for
mr
doball
was
known
to
be
very
fond
of
grog
the
former
walked
aft
to
conceal
his
mirth
but
the
latter
remained
mr
doball
was
in
a
great
rage
did
not
i
say
that
the
boy
was
half
a
fool
cried
he
to
the
first
lieutenant
at
all
events
i
not
allow
that
he
has
proved
himself
so
in
this
instance
replied
mr
falcon
for
he
has
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
then
the
first
lieutenant
joined
the
captain
and
they
both
went
off
laughing
put
it
on
the
capstan
sir
said
mr
doball
to
me
in
an
angry
voice
i
punish
you
i
was
very
much
astonished
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
had
done
right
or
wrong
at
all
events
thought
i
to
myself
i
did
for
the
best
so
i
put
it
on
the
capstan
and
walked
to
my
own
side
of
the
deck
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
then
went
below
and
came
aft
what
vessel
is
it
said
i
to
the
best
of
my
belief
it
one
of
your
going
home
with
despatches
replied
he
a
bathing
machine
said
i
why
i
thought
that
they
were
hauled
up
on
the
beach
that
the
brighton
sort
but
these
are
made
not
to
go
up
at
all
what
then
why
to
to
be
sure
and
remarkably
well
they
answer
their
purpose
i
wo
puzzle
you
any
more
my
peter
i
spaking
helligorically
which
i
believe
means
telling
a
hell
of
a
lie
it
one
of
your
brigs
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
i
then
told
what
had
occurred
and
how
the
master
was
angry
with
me
laughed
very
heartily
and
told
me
never
to
mind
but
to
keep
in
the
and
watch
him
a
glass
of
grog
is
a
bait
that
he
play
round
till
he
gorges
when
you
see
it
to
his
lips
go
up
to
him
boldly
and
ask
his
pardon
if
you
have
offended
him
and
then
if
he
a
good
christian
as
i
believe
him
to
be
he
not
refuse
it
i
thought
this
was
very
good
advice
and
i
waited
under
the
bulwark
on
the
i
observed
that
the
master
made
shorter
and
shorter
turns
every
time
till
at
last
he
stopped
at
the
capstan
and
looked
at
the
grog
he
waited
about
half
a
minute
and
then
he
took
up
the
tumbler
and
drank
about
half
of
it
it
was
very
strong
and
he
stopped
to
take
breath
i
thought
this
was
the
right
time
and
i
went
up
to
him
the
tumbler
was
again
to
his
lips
and
before
he
saw
me
i
said
i
hope
sir
you
forgive
me
i
never
heard
of
a
night
telescope
and
knowing
that
you
had
walked
so
long
i
thought
you
were
tired
and
wanted
something
to
drink
to
refresh
you
well
mr
simple
said
he
after
he
had
finished
the
glass
with
a
deep
sigh
of
pleasure
as
you
meant
kindly
i
shall
let
you
off
this
time
but
recollect
that
whenever
you
bring
me
a
glass
of
grog
again
it
must
not
be
in
the
presence
of
the
captain
or
first
lieutenant
i
promised
him
very
faithfully
and
went
away
quite
delighted
with
my
having
made
my
peace
with
him
and
more
so
that
the
first
lieutenant
had
said
that
i
was
no
fool
for
what
i
had
done
at
last
our
watch
was
over
and
about
two
bells
i
was
relieved
by
the
midshipmen
of
the
next
watch
it
is
very
unfair
not
to
relieve
in
time
but
if
i
said
a
word
i
was
certain
to
be
thrashed
the
next
day
upon
some
pretence
or
other
on
the
other
hand
the
midshipman
whom
i
relieved
was
also
much
bigger
than
i
was
and
if
i
was
not
up
before
one
bell
i
was
cut
down
and
thrashed
by
him
so
that
between
the
two
i
kept
much
more
than
my
share
of
the
watch
except
when
the
master
sent
me
to
bed
before
it
was
over
chapter
xiii
the
first
lieutenant
prescribes
for
one
of
his
patients
his
prescriptions
consisting
of
only
finishes
the
history
of
his
life
in
which
the
proverb
of
the
more
the
merrier
is
sadly
disproved
a
new
pair
of
boots
causes
the
of
their
owner
walking
home
after
a
ball
meets
with
an
accident
the
next
morning
i
was
on
deck
at
seven
bells
to
see
the
hammocks
stowed
when
i
was
witness
to
mr
falcon
the
first
lieutenant
having
recourse
to
one
of
his
remedies
to
cure
a
of
smoking
a
practice
to
which
he
had
a
great
aversion
he
never
interfered
with
the
men
smoking
in
the
galley
or
chewing
tobacco
but
he
prevented
the
boys
that
is
lads
under
twenty
or
from
indulging
in
the
habit
too
early
the
first
lieutenant
smelt
the
tobacco
as
the
boy
passed
him
on
the
why
neill
you
have
been
smoking
said
the
first
lieutenant
i
thought
you
were
aware
that
i
did
not
permit
such
lads
as
you
to
use
tobacco
if
you
please
sir
replied
the
touching
his
hat
got
worms
and
they
say
that
smoking
be
good
for
them
good
for
them
said
the
first
lieutenant
yes
very
good
for
them
but
very
bad
for
you
why
my
good
fellow
they
thrive
upon
tobacco
until
they
grow
as
large
as
conger
eels
heat
is
what
the
worms
are
fond
of
but
cold
cold
will
kill
them
now
i
cure
you
come
here
walk
this
boy
up
and
down
the
and
every
time
you
get
forward
abreast
of
the
block
put
his
mouth
to
windward
squeeze
him
sharp
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
until
he
opens
his
mouth
wide
and
there
keep
him
and
let
the
cold
air
blow
down
his
throat
while
you
count
ten
then
walk
him
aft
and
when
you
are
forward
again
proceed
as
cold
kills
worms
my
poor
boy
not
tobacco
i
wonder
that
you
are
not
dead
by
this
time
the
who
liked
the
joke
as
did
all
the
seamen
seized
hold
of
the
lad
and
as
soon
as
they
arrived
forward
gave
him
such
a
squeeze
of
the
neck
as
to
force
him
to
open
his
mouth
if
it
were
only
to
cry
with
pain
the
wind
was
very
fresh
and
blew
into
his
mouth
so
strong
that
it
actually
whistled
while
he
was
forced
to
keep
it
open
and
thus
he
was
obliged
to
walk
up
and
down
cooling
his
inside
for
nearly
two
hours
when
the
first
lieutenant
sent
for
him
and
told
him
that
he
thought
all
the
worms
must
be
dead
by
that
time
but
if
they
were
not
the
lad
was
not
to
apply
his
own
remedies
but
come
to
him
for
another
dose
however
the
boy
was
of
the
same
opinion
as
the
first
lieutenant
and
never
complained
of
worms
again
a
few
nights
afterwards
when
we
had
the
middle
watch
proceeded
with
his
story
where
was
it
that
i
left
off
you
left
off
at
the
time
that
you
were
taken
out
of
confinement
so
i
did
sure
enough
and
it
was
with
no
that
i
went
to
my
duty
however
as
there
was
no
help
for
it
i
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
as
before
with
my
hands
in
my
pockets
thinking
of
old
ireland
and
my
great
ancestor
brien
borru
and
so
i
went
on
behaving
myself
like
a
real
gentleman
and
getting
into
no
more
scrapes
until
the
fleet
put
into
the
cove
of
cork
and
i
found
myself
within
a
few
miles
of
my
father
house
you
may
suppose
that
the
anchor
had
hardly
kissed
the
mud
before
i
went
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
asked
leave
to
go
on
shore
now
the
first
lieutenant
was
not
in
the
sweetest
of
tempers
seeing
as
how
the
captain
had
been
hauling
him
over
the
coals
for
not
carrying
on
the
duty
according
to
his
satisfaction
so
he
answered
me
very
gruffly
that
i
should
not
leave
the
ship
bother
said
i
to
myself
will
never
do
so
up
i
walked
to
the
captain
and
touching
my
hat
reminded
him
that
had
a
father
and
mother
and
a
pretty
sprinkling
of
brothers
and
sisters
who
were
dying
to
see
me
and
that
i
hoped
that
he
would
give
me
leave
the
first
lieutenant
said
he
turning
away
have
sir
replied
i
he
says
that
the
devil
a
bit
shall
i
put
my
foot
on
shore
you
have
misbehaved
yourself
said
the
captain
a
bit
of
it
captain
willis
replied
i
the
first
lieutenant
who
has
misbehaved
sir
answered
he
in
an
angry
tone
sir
did
he
misbehave
just
now
in
not
carrying
on
the
duty
according
to
your
will
and
pleasure
and
did
you
serve
him
out
just
as
he
deserved
and
is
he
sulky
because
you
did
and
ar
that
the
reason
why
i
am
not
to
go
on
shore
you
see
your
honour
it
all
true
as
i
said
and
the
first
lieutenant
has
misbehaved
and
not
i
hope
you
will
allow
me
to
go
on
shore
captain
god
bless
you
and
make
some
allowance
for
my
parental
feelings
towards
the
arthers
of
my
existence
you
any
fault
to
find
with
mr
said
the
captain
to
the
first
lieutenant
as
he
came
aft
more
than
i
have
with
midshipmen
in
general
but
i
believe
it
is
not
the
custom
for
officers
to
ask
leave
to
go
on
shore
before
the
sails
are
furled
and
the
yards
squared
true
replied
the
captain
mr
you
must
wait
until
the
watch
is
called
and
then
if
you
ask
the
first
lieutenant
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
will
have
leave
granted
to
you
to
go
and
see
your
friends
kindly
sir
replied
i
and
i
hoped
that
the
yards
and
sails
would
be
finished
off
as
soon
as
possible
for
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
and
i
felt
that
if
i
had
been
kept
much
longer
it
would
have
flown
on
shore
before
me
i
thought
myself
very
clever
in
this
business
but
i
was
never
a
greater
fool
in
my
life
for
there
was
no
such
hurry
to
have
gone
on
shore
and
the
first
lieutenant
never
forgave
me
for
appealing
to
the
captain
but
of
that
and
all
in
good
time
at
last
i
obtained
a
grumbling
assent
to
my
going
on
shore
and
off
i
went
like
a
being
in
a
desperate
hurry
i
hired
a
to
take
me
to
my
father
house
it
the
of
ballyhinch
that
you
mane
inquired
the
spalpeen
who
drove
the
horse
it
is
replied
i
how
is
he
and
all
the
noble
family
of
the
well
enough
bating
the
boy
tim
who
caught
a
bit
of
confusion
in
his
head
the
other
night
at
the
fair
and
now
lies
at
home
in
bed
quite
insensible
to
mate
or
drink
but
the
doctors
give
hopes
of
his
recovery
as
all
the
are
known
to
have
such
thick
heads
do
you
mane
by
that
bad
manners
to
you
said
i
poor
tim
how
did
it
happen
was
there
a
fight
much
of
a
fight
only
a
bit
of
a
skrummage
three
crowners
inquests
no
more
you
are
not
going
the
straight
road
you
thief
said
i
seeing
that
he
had
turned
off
to
the
left
my
reasons
for
that
your
honour
replied
he
always
turn
away
from
the
castle
out
of
principle
i
lost
a
friend
there
and
it
makes
me
melancholy
came
that
for
to
happen
by
accident
your
honour
they
hung
my
poor
brother
patrick
there
because
he
was
a
bad
hand
at
arithmetic
should
have
gone
to
a
better
school
then
said
i
an
idea
that
it
was
a
bad
school
that
he
was
brought
up
in
replied
he
with
a
sigh
was
a
your
honour
and
one
day
somehow
or
another
he
a
cow
too
much
all
for
not
knowing
how
to
count
your
honour
bad
luck
to
his
that
may
be
very
true
said
i
pace
be
to
his
soul
but
i
do
see
why
you
are
to
drag
me
that
in
such
a
hurry
two
miles
out
of
my
way
out
of
principle
your
honour
in
a
hurry
to
get
home
then
i
be
thinking
they
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
see
you
who
told
you
that
my
name
was
you
baste
and
do
you
dare
to
say
that
my
friends
wo
be
glad
to
see
me
your
honour
all
an
idea
of
mine
so
say
no
more
about
it
only
this
i
know
father
who
gives
me
absolution
tould
me
the
other
day
that
i
ought
to
pay
him
and
not
run
in
debt
and
then
run
away
like
terence
who
went
to
say
without
paying
for
his
shirts
and
his
shoes
and
his
stockings
nor
anything
else
and
who
would
live
to
be
hanged
as
sure
as
st
patrick
swam
over
the
liffey
with
his
head
under
his
arm
luck
to
that
father
mcgrath
cried
i
burn
me
but
i
be
revenged
upon
him
by
that
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
door
of
my
father
house
i
paid
the
rapparee
and
in
i
popped
there
was
my
father
and
mother
and
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
bating
tim
who
was
in
bed
sure
enough
and
died
next
day
and
that
baste
father
mcgrath
to
boot
when
my
mother
saw
me
she
ran
to
me
and
hugged
me
as
she
wept
on
my
neck
and
then
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
sat
down
again
but
nobody
else
said
d
do
or
opened
their
mouths
to
me
i
said
to
myself
there
some
trifling
mistake
here
but
i
held
my
tongue
at
last
they
all
opened
their
mouths
with
a
vengeance
my
father
commenced

cried
father
you

in
full
chorus
whilst
my
poor
mother
put
her
apron
to
her
eyes
and
said
nothing
devil
a
bit
for
myself
but
very
much
ashamed
for
you

in
this
manner

luck

those

threw

floor

share
of

keep

wicked
monster
said
father
that
now
it
no
better
than
a
midshipman
berth
replied
i
just
as
soon
stay
out
but
i
creep
in
in
spite
of
you
take
that
now
father
who
to
save
your
soul
and
send
you
to
heaven
if

do
you
wicked
wretch
but
i
see
you
d
d
first
so
take
that
now
terence
i
turn
protestant
and
damn
the
pope
take
that
now
father
at
this
last
broadside
of
mine
my
father
and
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
raised
a
cry
of
horror
and
my
mother
burst
into
tears
father
seized
hold
of
the
pot
of
holy
water
and
dipping
in
the
little
whisk
began
to
sprinkle
the
room
saying
a
latin
prayer
while
they
all
went
on
squalling
at
me
at
last
my
father
seized
the
stool
which
he
had
been
seated
upon
and
threw
it
at
my
head
i
dodged
and
it
knocked
down
father
who
had
just
walked
behind
me
in
full
song
i
knew
that
it
was
all
over
after
that
so
i
sprang
over
his
carcass
and
gained
the
door
morning
to
ye
all
and
better
manners
to
you
next
time
we
meet
cried
i
and
off
i
set
as
fast
as
i
could
for
the
ship
i
was
melancholy
enough
as
i
walked
back
and
thought
of
what
had
passed
need
not
have
been
in
such
a
confounded
hurry
said
i
to
myself
ask
leave
thereby
affronting
the
first
lieutenant
and
i
was
very
sorry
for
what
i
had
said
to
the
priest
for
my
conscience
thumped
me
very
hard
at
having
even
pretended
that
i
turn
protestant
which
i
never
intended
to
do
nor
never
will
but
live
and
die
a
good
catholic
as
all
my
posterity
have
done
before
me
and
as
i
trust
all
my
ancestors
will
for
generations
to
come
well
i
arrived
on
board
and
the
first
lieutenant
was
very
savage
i
hoped
he
would
get
over
it
but
he
never
did
and
he
continued
to
treat
me
so
ill
that
i
determined
to
quit
the
ship
which
i
did
as
soon
as
we
arrived
in
cawsand
bay
the
captain
allowed
me
to
go
for
i
told
him
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
and
he
saw
that
it
was
true
so
he
recommended
me
to
the
captain
of
a
jackass
frigate
who
was
in
want
of
midshipmen
what
do
you
mean
by
a
jackass
frigate
inquired
i
i
mean
one
of
your
so
called
because
there
is
as
much
difference
between
them
and
a
real
frigate
like
the
one
we
are
sailing
in
as
there
is
between
a
donkey
and
a
racehorse
well
the
ship
was
no
sooner
brought
down
to
the
to
have
her
ballast
taken
in
than
our
captain
came
down
to
her
a
little
thin
spare
man
but
a
man
of
weight
nevertheless
for
he
brought
a
great
pair
of
scales
with
him
and
weighed
everything
that
was
put
on
board
i
forget
his
real
name
but
the
sailors
christened
him
captain
avoirdupois
he
had
a
large
book
and
in
it
he
inserted
the
weight
of
the
ballast
and
of
the
shot
water
provisions
coals
standing
and
running
rigging
cables
and
everything
else
then
he
weighed
all
the
men
and
all
the
midshipmen
and
all
the
midshipmen
chests
and
all
the
officers
with
everything
belonging
to
them
lastly
he
weighed
himself
which
did
not
add
much
to
the
sum
total
i
do
exactly
know
what
this
was
for
but
he
was
always
talking
about
centres
of
gravity
displacement
of
fluid
and
lord
knows
what
i
believe
it
was
to
find
out
the
longitude
somehow
or
other
but
i
did
remain
long
enough
in
her
to
know
the
end
of
it
for
one
day
i
brought
on
board
a
pair
of
new
boots
which
i
forgot
to
report
that
they
might
be
put
into
the
scales
which
swang
on
the
gangway
and
whether
the
captain
thought
that
they
would
sink
his
ship
or
for
what
i
can
not
tell
but
he
ordered
me
to
quit
her
immediately
so
there
i
was
adrift
again
i
packed
up
my
traps
and
went
on
shore
putting
on
my
new
boots
out
of
spite
and
trod
into
all
the
mud
and
mire
i
could
meet
and
walked
up
and
down
from
plymouth
to
dock
until
i
was
tired
as
a
punishment
to
them
until
i
wore
the
scoundrels
out
in
a
fortnight
one
day
i
was
in
the
dockyard
looking
at
a
in
the
basin
just
brought
forward
for
service
and
i
inquired
who
was
to
be
the
captain
they
told
me
that
his
name
was
then
he
a
countryman
of
mine
thought
i
and
i
try
my
luck
so
i
called
at
goud
hotel
where
he
was
lodging
and
requested
to
speak
with
him
i
was
admitted
and
i
told
him
with
my
best
bow
that
i
had
come
as
a
volunteer
for
his
ship
and
that
my
name
was
as
it
happened
he
had
some
vacancies
and
liking
my
brogue
he
asked
me
in
what
ships
i
had
served
i
told
him
and
also
my
reason
for
quitting
my
last
which
was
because
i
was
turned
out
of
it
i
explained
the
story
of
the
boots
and
he
made
inquiries
and
found
that
it
was
all
true
and
then
he
gave
me
a
vacancy
as
master
mate
we
were
ordered
to
south
america
and
the
trade
winds
took
us
there
in
a
jiffey
i
liked
my
captain
and
officers
very
much
and
what
was
better
we
took
some
good
prizes
but
somehow
or
other
i
never
had
the
luck
to
remain
long
in
one
ship
and
that
by
no
fault
of
mine
at
least
not
in
this
instance
all
went
on
as
smooth
as
possible
until
one
day
the
captain
took
us
on
shore
to
a
ball
at
one
of
the
peaceable
districts
we
had
a
very
merry
night
of
it
but
as
luck
would
have
it
i
had
the
morning
watch
to
keep
and
see
the
decks
cleaned
and
as
i
never
neglected
my
duty
i
set
off
about
three
in
the
morning
just
at
break
of
day
to
go
on
board
of
the
ship
i
was
walking
along
the
sands
thinking
of
the
pretty
girl
that
i
been
dancing
with
and
had
got
about
half
way
to
the
ship
when
three
rapparees
of
spanish
soldiers
came
from
behind
a
rock
and
attacked
me
with
their
swords
and
bayonets
i
had
only
my
dirk
but
i
was
not
to
be
run
through
for
nothing
so
i
fought
them
as
long
as
i
could
i
finished
one
fellow
but
at
last
they
finished
me
for
a
bayonet
passed
through
my
body
and
i
forgot
all
about
it
well
it
appears
for
i
can
only
say
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
and
belief
that
after
they
had
killed
me
they
stripped
me
naked
and
buried
me
in
the
sand
carrying
away
with
them
the
body
of
their
comrade
so
there
i
was
dead
and
buried
but
said
i
whist
hold
your
tongue
you
not
heard
the
end
of
it
well
i
had
been
buried
about
an
hour
but
not
very
deep
it
appears
for
they
were
in
too
great
a
hurry
when
a
fisherman
and
his
daughter
came
along
the
beach
on
their
way
to
the
boat
and
the
daughter
god
bless
her
did
me
the
favour
to
tread
upon
my
nose
it
was
clear
that
she
had
never
trod
upon
an
irishman
nose
before
for
it
surprised
her
and
she
looked
down
to
see
what
was
there
and
not
seeing
anything
she
tried
it
again
with
her
foot
and
then
she
scraped
off
the
sand
and
discovered
my
pretty
face
i
was
quite
warm
and
still
breathing
for
the
sand
had
stopped
the
blood
and
prevented
my
bleeding
to
death
the
fisherman
pulled
me
out
and
took
me
on
his
back
to
the
house
where
the
captain
and
officers
were
still
dancing
when
he
brought
me
in
there
was
a
great
cry
from
the
ladies
not
because
i
was
murdered
for
they
are
used
to
it
in
those
countries
but
because
i
was
naked
which
they
considered
a
much
more
serious
affair
i
was
put
to
bed
and
a
boat
despatched
on
board
for
our
doctor
and
in
a
few
hours
i
was
able
to
speak
and
tell
them
how
it
happened
but
i
was
too
ill
to
move
when
the
ship
sailed
which
she
was
obliged
to
do
in
a
day
or
two
afterwards
so
the
captain
made
out
my
discharge
and
left
me
there
the
family
were
french
and
i
remained
with
them
for
six
months
before
i
could
obtain
a
passage
home
during
which
i
learnt
their
language
and
a
very
fair
allowance
of
spanish
to
boot
when
i
arrived
in
england
i
found
that
the
prizes
had
been
sold
and
that
the
money
was
ready
for
distribution
i
produced
my
certificate
and
received
for
my
share
so
it
come
at
last
thought
i
i
never
had
such
a
handful
of
money
in
my
life
but
i
hope
i
shall
again
very
soon
i
spread
it
out
on
the
table
as
soon
as
i
got
home
and
looked
at
it
and
then
i
said
to
myself
terence
will
you
keep
this
money
to
yourself
or
send
it
home
then
i
thought
of
father
and
the
stool
that
was
thrown
at
my
head
and
i
was
very
near
sweeping
it
all
back
into
my
pocket
but
then
i
thought
of
my
mother
and
of
the
cows
and
the
pig
and
the
furniture
all
gone
and
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
wanting
praties
and
i
made
a
vow
that
i
send
every
farthing
of
it
to
them
after
which
father
would
no
longer
think
of
not
giving
me
absolution
so
i
sent
them
every
doit
only
reserving
for
myself
the
pay
which
i
had
received
amounting
to
about
and
i
never
felt
more
happy
in
my
life
than
when
it
was
safe
in
the
and
fairly
out
of
my
hands
i
wrote
a
bit
of
a
letter
to
my
father
at
the
time
which
was
to
this
purpose
father
since
our
last
pleasant
meeting
at
which
you
threw
the
stool
at
my
head
missing
the
pigeon
and
hitting
the
crow
i
have
been
dead
and
buried
but
am
now
quite
well
thank
god
and
want
no
absolution
from
father
bad
luck
to
him
and
what
more
to
the
point
i
have
just
received
a
batch
of
the
first
i
have
handled
since
i
have
served
his
majesty
and
every
farthing
of
which
i
now
send
to
you
that
you
may
get
back
your
old
cows
and
the
pig
and
all
the
rest
of
the
articles
seized
to
pay
for
my
fitting
out
so
never
again
ask
me
whether
i
am
not
ashamed
of
myself
more
shame
to
you
for
abusing
a
dutiful
son
like
myself
who
went
to
sea
at
your
bidding
and
has
never
had
a
real
good
potato
down
his
throat
ever
since
i
a
true
tell
my
mother
and
do
mane
to
turn
protestant
but
uphold
the
religion
of
my
country
although
the
devil
may
take
father
and
his
holy
water
to
boot
i
come
and
see
you
as
perhaps
you
may
have
another
stool
ready
for
my
head
and
may
take
better
aim
next
time
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
affectionate
son
about
three
weeks
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
from
my
father
telling
me
that
i
was
a
real
and
that
if
any
one
dared
hint
to
the
contrary
he
would
break
every
bone
in
his
body
that
they
had
received
the
money
and
thanked
me
for
a
real
gentleman
as
i
was
that
i
should
have
the
best
stool
in
the
house
next
time
i
came
not
for
my
head
but
for
my
tail
that
father
sent
me
his
blessing
and
had
given
me
absolution
for
all
i
had
done
or
should
do
for
the
next
ten
years
to
come
that
my
mother
had
cried
with
joy
at
my
dutiful
behaviour
and
that
all
my
brothers
and
sisters
bating
tim
who
had
died
the
day
after
i
left
them
wished
me
good
luck
and
plenty
more
to
send
home
to
them
this
was
all
very
pleasant
and
i
had
nothing
left
on
my
mind
but
to
get
another
ship
so
i
went
to
the
and
told
him
how
it
was
that
i
left
my
last
and
he
said
being
dead
and
buried
was
quite
sufficient
reason
for
any
one
leaving
his
ship
and
that
he
would
procure
me
another
now
that
i
had
come
to
life
again
i
was
sent
on
board
of
the
where
i
remained
about
ten
days
and
then
was
sent
round
to
join
this
frigate
and
so
my
story
ended
and
eight
bells
striking
so
the
watch
is
ended
too
jump
down
peter
and
call
robinson
and
tell
him
that
i
trouble
him
to
forget
to
go
to
sleep
again
as
he
did
last
time
and
leave
me
here
kicking
my
heels
contrary
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
service
chapter
xiv
the
first
lieutenant
has
more
patients
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
lets
me
into
the
secret
of
his
gentility
before
i
proceed
with
my
narrative
i
wish
to
explain
to
the
reader
that
my
history
was
not
written
in
when
i
had
obtained
a
greater
knowledge
of
the
world
when
i
first
went
to
sea
i
promised
my
mother
that
i
would
keep
a
journal
of
what
passed
with
my
reflections
upon
it
to
this
promise
i
rigidly
adhered
and
since
i
have
been
my
own
master
these
journals
have
remained
in
my
possession
in
writing
therefore
the
early
part
of
my
adventures
everything
is
stated
as
it
was
impressed
on
my
mind
at
the
time
upon
many
points
i
have
since
had
reason
to
form
a
different
opinion
from
that
which
is
recorded
and
upon
many
others
i
have
since
laughed
heartily
at
my
folly
and
simplicity
but
still
i
have
thought
it
advisable
to
let
the
ideas
of
the
period
remain
rather
than
correct
them
by
those
of
experience
a
boy
of
fifteen
brought
up
in
a
secluded
country
town
can
not
be
expected
to
reason
and
judge
as
a
young
man
who
has
seen
much
of
life
and
passed
through
a
variety
of
adventures
the
reader
must
therefore
remember
that
i
have
referred
to
my
journal
for
the
opinions
and
feelings
which
guided
me
between
each
distinct
anniversary
of
my
existence
we
had
now
been
cruising
for
six
weeks
and
i
found
that
my
profession
was
much
more
agreeable
than
i
had
anticipated
my
desire
to
please
was
taken
for
the
deed
and
although
i
occasionally
made
a
blunder
yet
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
seemed
to
think
that
i
was
attentive
to
my
duty
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
only
smiled
at
my
mistakes
i
also
discovered
that
however
my
natural
capacity
may
have
been
estimated
by
my
family
that
it
was
not
so
depreciated
here
and
every
day
i
felt
more
confidence
in
myself
and
hoped
by
attention
and
diligence
to
make
up
for
a
want
of
natural
endowment
there
certainly
is
something
in
the
life
of
a
sailor
which
enlarges
the
mind
when
i
was
at
home
six
months
before
i
allowed
other
people
to
think
for
me
and
acted
wholly
on
the
of
their
suggestions
on
board
to
the
best
of
my
ability
i
thought
for
myself
i
became
happy
with
my
messmates
those
who
were
harsh
upon
me
left
off
because
i
never
resented
their
conduct
and
those
who
were
kind
to
me
were
even
kinder
than
before
the
time
flew
away
quickly
i
suppose
because
i
knew
exactly
what
i
had
to
do
and
each
day
was
the
forerunner
of
the
ensuing
the
first
lieutenant
was
one
of
the
most
amusing
men
i
ever
knew
yet
he
never
relaxed
from
the
discipline
of
the
service
or
took
the
least
liberty
with
either
his
superiors
or
inferiors
his
humour
was
principally
shown
in
his
various
modes
of
punishment
and
however
severe
the
punishment
was
to
the
party
the
manner
of
inflicting
it
was
invariably
a
source
of
amusement
to
the
remainder
of
the
ship
company
i
often
thought
that
although
no
individual
liked
being
punished
yet
that
all
the
ship
company
were
quite
pleased
when
a
punishment
took
place
he
was
very
particular
about
his
decks
they
were
always
as
white
as
snow
and
nothing
displeased
him
so
much
as
their
being
soiled
it
was
for
that
reason
that
he
had
such
an
objection
to
the
use
of
tobacco
there
were
placed
in
different
parts
of
the
decks
for
the
use
of
the
men
that
they
might
not
dirty
the
planks
with
the
sometimes
a
man
in
his
hurry
forgot
to
use
these
pans
but
as
the
mess
to
which
the
stain
might
be
opposite
had
their
grog
stopped
if
the
party
were
not
found
out
they
took
good
care
not
only
to
keep
a
but
to
inform
against
the
offender
now
the
punishment
for
the
offence
was
as
follows
the
man
hands
were
tied
behind
his
back
and
a
large
tin
fixed
to
his
chest
by
a
strap
over
the
shoulders
all
the
other
boxes
on
the
lower
deck
were
taken
away
and
he
was
obliged
to
walk
there
ready
to
attend
the
summons
of
any
man
who
might
wish
to
empty
his
mouth
of
the
the
other
men
were
so
pleased
at
the
fancy
that
they
spat
twice
as
much
as
before
for
the
pleasure
of
making
him
run
about
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
called
it
the
first
lieutenant
he
observed
to
me
one
day
that
really
mr
falcon
was
such
an
about
his
decks
that
he
was
afraid
to
pudding
an
anchor
on
the
forecastle
i
was
much
amused
one
morning
watch
that
i
kept
we
were
stowing
the
hammocks
in
the
nettings
when
one
of
the
boys
came
up
with
his
hammock
on
his
shoulder
and
as
he
passed
the
first
lieutenant
the
latter
perceived
that
he
had
a
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
cheek
what
have
you
got
there
my
good
lad
a
your
cheek
is
very
much
swelled
no
sir
replied
the
boy
there
nothing
at
all
the
matter
o
there
must
be
it
is
a
bad
tooth
then
open
your
mouth
and
let
me
see
very
reluctantly
the
boy
opened
his
mouth
and
discovered
a
large
roll
of
i
see
i
see
said
the
first
lieutenant
your
mouth
wants
overhauling
and
your
teeth
cleaning
i
wish
we
had
a
dentist
on
board
but
as
we
have
not
i
will
operate
as
well
as
i
can
send
the
armourer
up
here
with
his
tongs
when
the
armourer
made
his
appearance
the
boy
was
made
to
open
his
mouth
while
the
chaw
of
tobacco
was
extracted
with
his
rough
instrument
there
now
said
the
first
lieutenant
i
sure
that
you
must
feel
better
already
you
never
could
have
had
any
appetite
now
captain
of
the
afterguard
bring
a
piece
of
old
canvas
and
some
sand
here
and
clean
his
teeth
nicely
the
captain
of
the
afterguard
came
forward
and
putting
the
boy
head
between
his
knees
scrubbed
his
teeth
well
with
the
sand
and
canvas
for
two
or
three
minutes
there
that
will
do
said
the
first
lieutenant
now
my
little
fellow
your
mouth
is
nice
and
clean
and
you
enjoy
your
breakfast
it
was
impossible
for
you
to
have
eaten
anything
with
your
mouth
in
such
a
nasty
state
when
it
dirty
again
come
to
me
and
i
be
your
dentist
one
day
i
was
on
the
forecastle
with
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
who
was
very
kind
to
me
he
had
been
showing
me
how
to
make
the
various
knots
and
bends
of
rope
which
are
used
in
our
service
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
very
stupid
but
he
showed
me
over
and
over
again
until
i
learnt
how
to
make
them
amongst
others
he
taught
me
a
fisherman
bend
which
he
pronounced
to
be
the
of
all
knots
and
mr
simple
continued
he
there
is
a
moral
in
that
knot
you
observe
that
when
the
parts
are
drawn
the
right
way
and
together
the
more
you
pull
the
faster
they
hold
and
the
more
impossible
to
untie
them
but
see
by
hauling
them
apart
how
a
little
difference
a
pull
the
other
way
immediately
disunites
them
and
then
how
easy
they
cast
off
in
a
moment
that
points
out
the
necessity
of
pulling
together
in
this
world
mr
simple
when
we
wish
to
hold
on
and
that
a
piece
of
philosophy
worth
all
the
thousand
and
odd
years
of
my
friend
the
carpenter
which
leads
to
nothing
but
a
brown
study
when
he
ought
to
be
attending
to
his
duty
very
true
mr
chucks
you
are
the
better
philosopher
of
the
two
i
am
the
better
educated
mr
simple
and
i
trust
more
of
a
gentleman
i
consider
a
gentleman
to
be
to
a
certain
degree
a
philosopher
for
very
often
he
is
obliged
to
support
his
character
as
such
to
put
up
with
what
another
person
may
very
properly
fly
in
a
passion
about
i
think
coolness
is
the
great
of
a
gentleman
in
the
service
mr
simple
one
is
obliged
to
appear
angry
without
indulging
the
sentiment
i
can
assure
you
that
i
never
lose
my
temper
even
when
i
use
my
rattan
why
then
mr
chucks
do
you
swear
so
much
at
the
men
surely
that
is
not
gentlemanly
most
certainly
not
sir
but
i
must
defend
myself
by
observing
the
very
artificial
state
in
which
we
live
on
board
of
a
necessity
my
dear
mr
simple
has
no
law
you
must
observe
how
gently
i
always
commence
when
i
have
to
find
fault
i
do
that
to
prove
my
gentility
but
sir
my
zeal
for
the
service
obliges
me
to
alter
my
language
to
prove
in
the
end
that
i
am
in
earnest
nothing
would
afford
me
more
pleasure
than
to
be
able
to
carry
on
the
duty
as
a
gentleman
but
impossible
i
really
can
not
see
why
perhaps
then
mr
simple
you
will
explain
to
me
why
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
swear
that
i
do
not
pretend
to
answer
but
they
only
do
so
upon
an
emergency
exactly
so
but
sir
their
is
my
daily
and
hourly
duty
in
the
continual
working
of
the
ship
i
am
answerable
for
all
that
goes
amiss
the
life
of
a
boatswain
is
a
life
of
and
therefore
i
swear
i
still
can
not
allow
it
to
be
requisite
and
certainly
it
is
sinful
excuse
me
my
dear
sir
it
is
absolutely
requisite
and
not
at
all
sinful
there
is
one
language
for
the
pulpit
and
another
for
on
board
ship
and
in
either
situation
a
man
must
make
use
of
those
terms
most
likely
to
produce
the
necessary
effect
upon
his
listeners
whether
it
is
from
long
custom
of
the
service
or
from
the
indifference
of
a
sailor
to
all
common
things
and
language
i
ca
exactly
explain
myself
mr
simple
but
i
know
what
i
mean
perhaps
constant
excitement
may
do
and
therefore
he
requires
more
as
they
call
it
to
make
him
move
certain
it
is
that
common
parlancy
wo
do
with
a
common
seaman
it
is
not
here
as
in
the
scriptures
this
and
he
doeth
it
by
the
bye
that
chap
must
have
had
his
soldiers
in
tight
order
but
it
is
this
d
n
your
eyes
and
then
it
is
done
directly
the
order
to
just
carries
the
weight
of
a
but
it
wants
the
perpelling
power
the
d
n
is
the
gunpowder
which
sets
it
flying
in
the
execution
of
its
duty
do
you
comprehend
me
mr
simple
i
perfectly
understand
you
mr
chucks
and
i
can
not
help
remarking
and
that
without
flattery
that
you
are
very
different
from
the
rest
of
the
warrant
officers
where
did
you
receive
your
education
mr
simple
i
am
here
a
boatswain
with
a
clean
shirt
and
i
say
it
myself
and
no
one
dare
gainsay
it
also
with
a
thorough
knowledge
of
my
duty
but
although
i
do
not
say
that
i
ever
was
better
off
i
can
say
this
that
i
been
in
the
best
society
in
the
company
of
lords
and
ladies
i
once
dined
with
your
grandfather
that
more
than
ever
i
did
for
he
never
asked
me
nor
took
the
least
notice
of
me
replied
i
what
i
state
is
true
i
did
not
know
that
he
was
your
grandfather
until
yesterday
when
i
was
talking
with
mr
but
i
perfectly
recollect
him
although
i
was
very
young
at
that
time
now
mr
simple
if
you
will
promise
me
as
a
gentleman
and
i
know
you
are
one
that
you
will
not
repeat
what
i
tell
you
then
i
let
you
into
the
history
of
my
life
mr
chucks
as
i
am
a
gentleman
i
never
will
divulge
it
until
you
are
dead
and
buried
and
not
then
if
you
do
not
wish
it
when
i
am
dead
and
buried
you
may
do
as
you
please
it
may
then
be
of
service
to
other
people
although
my
story
is
not
a
very
long
one
mr
chucks
then
sat
down
upon
the
of
the
booms
by
the
funnel
and
i
took
my
place
by
his
side
when
he
commenced
as
follows
my
father
was
a
boatswain
before
me
one
of
the
old
school
rough
as
a
bear
and
drunken
as
a
gosport
fiddler
my
mother
was
my
mother
and
i
shall
say
no
more
my
father
was
invalided
for
harbour
duty
after
a
life
of
intoxication
and
died
shortly
afterwards
in
the
meantime
i
had
been
by
the
kindness
of
the
wife
educated
at
a
foundation
school
i
was
thirteen
when
my
father
died
and
my
mother
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
me
wished
to
bind
me
apprentice
to
a
merchant
vessel
but
this
i
refused
and
after
six
months
quarrelling
on
the
subject
i
decided
the
point
by
volunteering
in
the
frigate
i
believe
that
my
gentlemanly
ideas
were
innate
mr
simple
i
never
as
a
child
could
bear
the
idea
of
the
merchant
service
after
i
had
been
a
week
on
board
i
was
appointed
servant
to
the
purser
where
i
gave
such
satisfaction
by
my
alertness
and
dexterity
that
the
first
lieutenant
took
me
away
from
the
purser
to
attend
upon
himself
so
that
in
two
months
i
was
a
person
of
such
consequence
as
to
create
a
disturbance
in
the
gunroom
for
the
purser
was
very
angry
and
many
of
the
officers
took
his
part
it
was
whispered
that
i
was
the
son
of
the
first
lieutenant
and
that
he
was
aware
of
it
how
far
that
may
be
true
i
know
not
but
there
was
a
likeness
between
us
and
my
mother
who
was
a
very
pretty
woman
attended
his
ship
many
years
before
as
a
bumboat
girl
i
ca
pretend
to
say
anything
about
it
but
this
i
do
say
mr
simple
and
many
will
blame
me
for
it
but
i
ca
help
my
natural
feelings
that
i
had
rather
be
the
of
a
gentleman
than
the
offspring
of
a
boatswain
and
his
wife
there
no
chance
of
good
blood
in
your
veins
in
the
latter
instance
whereas
in
the
former
you
may
have
stolen
a
drop
or
two
it
so
happened
that
after
i
had
served
the
first
lieutenant
for
about
a
year
a
young
lord
i
must
not
mention
his
name
mr
simple
was
sent
to
sea
by
his
friends
or
by
his
own
choice
i
do
know
which
but
i
was
told
that
his
uncle
who
was
and
had
an
interest
in
his
death
persuaded
him
to
go
a
lord
at
that
period
some
years
ago
was
a
rarity
in
the
service
and
they
used
to
salute
him
when
he
came
on
board
the
consequence
was
that
the
young
lord
must
have
a
servant
to
himself
although
all
the
rest
of
the
midshipmen
had
but
one
servant
between
them
the
captain
inquired
who
was
the
best
boy
in
the
ship
and
the
purser
to
whom
he
appealed
recommended
me
accordingly
much
to
the
annoyance
of
the
first
lieutenant
for
first
lieutenants
in
those
days
did
not
assume
as
they
do
now
not
that
i
refer
to
mr
falcon
who
is
a
gentleman
i
was
immediately
surrendered
to
his
lordship
i
had
a
very
easy
comfortable
life
of
it
i
did
little
or
nothing
if
inquired
for
when
all
hands
were
turned
up
i
was
cleaning
his
lordship
boots
or
brushing
his
lordship
clothes
and
there
was
nothing
to
be
said
when
his
lordship
name
was
mentioned
we
went
to
the
mediterranean
because
his
lordship
mamma
wished
it
and
we
had
been
there
about
a
year
when
his
lordship
ate
so
many
grapes
that
he
was
seized
with
a
dysentery
he
was
ill
for
three
weeks
and
then
he
requested
to
be
sent
to
malta
in
a
transport
going
to
gibraltar
or
rather
to
the
barbary
coast
for
bullocks
he
became
worse
every
day
and
made
his
will
leaving
me
all
his
effects
on
board
which
i
certainly
deserved
for
the
kindness
with
which
i
had
nursed
him
off
malta
we
fell
in
with
a
xebeque
bound
to
civita
vecchia
and
the
captain
of
the
transport
anxious
to
proceed
advised
our
going
on
board
of
her
as
the
wind
was
light
and
contrary
and
these
mediterranean
vessels
sailed
better
on
a
wind
than
the
transport
my
master
who
was
now
sinking
fast
consented
and
we
changed
our
ships
the
next
day
he
died
and
a
gale
of
wind
came
on
which
prevented
us
from
gaining
the
port
for
several
days
and
the
body
of
his
lordship
not
only
became
so
offensive
but
affected
the
superstition
of
the
catholic
sailors
so
much
that
it
was
hove
overboard
none
of
the
people
could
speak
english
nor
could
i
speak
maltese
they
had
no
idea
who
we
were
and
i
had
plenty
of
time
for
cogitation
i
had
often
thought
what
a
fine
thing
it
was
to
be
a
lord
and
as
often
wished
that
i
had
been
born
one
the
wind
was
still
against
us
when
a
merchant
vessel
ran
down
to
us
that
had
left
civita
vecchia
for
gibraltar
i
desired
the
captain
of
the
xebeque
to
make
a
signal
of
distress
or
rather
i
did
myself
and
the
vessel
which
proved
to
be
english
bore
down
to
us
i
manned
the
boat
to
go
on
board
and
the
idea
came
into
my
head
that
although
they
might
refuse
to
take
me
they
would
not
refuse
a
lord
i
put
on
the
midshipman
uniform
belonging
to
his
lordship
but
then
certainly
belonging
to
me
and
went
alongside
of
the
merchant
vessel
i
told
them
that
i
had
left
my
ship
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
and
wanted
a
passage
to
gibraltar
on
my
way
home
my
title
and
immediate
acceptance
of
the
terms
demanded
for
my
passage
was
sufficient
my
property
was
brought
from
the
xebeque
and
of
course
as
they
could
not
speak
english
they
could
not
contradict
even
if
they
suspected
here
mr
simple
i
must
acknowledge
a
slight
flaw
in
my
early
history
which
i
impart
to
you
in
confidence
or
otherwise
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
prove
that
i
was
correct
in
asserting
that
i
had
dined
with
your
grandfather
but
the
temptation
was
too
strong
and
i
could
not
resist
think
yourself
mr
simple
after
having
served
as
a
ship
boy
clouted
here
kicked
there
damned
by
one
and
sent
to
hell
by
another
to
find
myself
treated
with
such
respect
and
deference
and
my
lorded
this
and
my
lorded
that
every
minute
of
the
day
during
my
passage
to
gibraltar
i
had
plenty
of
time
for
arranging
my
plans
i
hardly
need
say
that
my
lord
was
valuable
and
what
was
better
they
exactly
fitted
me
i
also
had
his
watches
and
trinkets
and
many
other
things
besides
a
bag
of
dollars
however
they
were
honestly
mine
the
only
thing
that
i
took
was
his
name
which
he
had
no
further
occasion
for
poor
fellow
but
it
no
use
defending
what
was
wrong
it
was
dishonest
and
an
end
of
it
now
observe
mr
simple
how
one
thing
leads
to
another
i
declare
to
you
that
my
first
idea
of
making
use
of
his
lordship
name
was
to
procure
a
passage
to
gibraltar
i
then
was
undecided
how
to
act
but
as
i
had
charge
of
his
papers
and
letters
to
his
mother
and
guardian
i
think
indeed
i
am
almost
sure
that
i
should
have
laid
aside
my
dignity
and
midshipman
dress
and
applied
for
a
passage
home
to
the
commissioner
of
the
yard
but
it
was
fated
to
be
otherwise
for
the
master
of
the
transport
went
on
shore
to
report
and
obtain
pratique
and
he
told
them
everywhere
that
young
lord
a
was
a
passenger
with
him
going
to
england
for
the
benefit
of
his
health
in
less
than
off
came
the
commissioner
boat
and
another
boat
from
the
governor
requesting
the
honour
of
my
company
and
that
i
would
take
a
bed
at
their
houses
during
my
stay
what
could
i
do
i
began
to
be
frightened
but
i
was
more
afraid
to
confess
that
i
was
an
impostor
for
i
am
sure
the
master
of
the
transport
alone
would
have
kicked
me
overboard
if
i
had
let
him
know
that
he
had
been
so
confounded
polite
to
a
ship
boy
so
i
blushed
half
from
modesty
and
half
from
guilt
and
accepted
the
invitation
of
the
governor
sending
a
polite
verbal
refusal
to
the
commissioner
upon
the
plea
of
there
being
no
paper
or
pens
on
board
i
had
so
often
accompanied
my
late
master
that
i
knew
very
well
how
to
conduct
myself
and
had
borrowed
a
good
deal
of
his
air
and
appearance
indeed
i
had
a
natural
taste
for
gentility
i
could
write
and
read
not
perhaps
so
well
as
i
ought
to
have
done
considering
the
education
i
had
received
but
still
quite
well
enough
for
a
lord
and
indeed
much
better
than
my
late
master
i
knew
his
signature
well
enough
although
the
very
idea
of
being
forced
to
use
it
made
me
tremble
however
the
die
was
cast
i
ought
to
observe
that
in
one
point
we
were
not
unlike
both
had
curly
light
hair
and
blue
eyes
in
other
points
there
was
no
resemblance
i
was
by
far
the
chap
of
the
two
and
as
we
had
been
up
the
mediterranean
for
two
years
i
had
no
fear
of
any
doubt
as
to
my
identity
until
i
arrived
in
england
well
mr
simple
i
dressed
myself
very
carefully
put
on
my
chains
and
rings
and
a
little
perfume
on
my
handkerchief
and
accompanied
the
to
the
governor
where
i
was
asked
after
my
mother
lady
and
my
uncle
my
guardian
and
a
hundred
other
questions
at
first
i
was
much
confused
which
was
attributed
to
bashfulness
and
so
it
was
but
not
of
the
right
sort
but
before
the
day
was
over
i
had
become
so
accustomed
to
be
called
lord
and
to
my
situation
that
i
was
quite
at
my
ease
and
began
to
watch
the
motions
and
behaviour
of
the
company
that
i
might
regulate
my
comportment
by
that
of
good
society
i
remained
at
gibraltar
for
a
fortnight
and
then
was
offered
a
passage
in
a
transport
ordered
to
portsmouth
being
an
officer
of
course
it
was
free
to
a
certain
extent
on
my
passage
to
england
i
again
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
put
off
my
dress
and
title
as
soon
as
i
could
escape
from
observation
but
i
was
prevented
as
before
the
sent
off
to
request
the
pleasure
of
my
company
to
dinner
i
dared
not
refuse
and
there
i
was
my
lord
as
before
courted
and
feasted
by
everybody
tradesmen
called
to
request
the
honour
of
my
lordship
custom
my
table
at
the
hotel
was
covered
with
cards
of
all
descriptions
and
to
confess
the
truth
i
liked
my
situation
so
much
and
had
been
so
accustomed
to
it
that
i
now
began
to
dislike
the
idea
that
one
day
or
other
i
must
resign
it
which
i
determined
to
do
as
soon
as
i
quitted
the
place
my
bill
at
the
hotel
was
very
extravagant
and
more
than
i
could
pay
but
the
master
said
it
was
not
of
the
least
consequence
that
of
course
his
lordship
had
not
provided
himself
with
cash
just
coming
from
foreign
parts
and
offered
to
supply
me
with
money
if
i
required
it
this
i
will
say
i
was
honest
enough
to
refuse
i
left
my
cards
as
they
do
mr
simple
in
all
society
and
set
off
in
the
mail
for
london
where
i
fully
resolved
to
drop
my
title
and
to
proceed
to
scotland
to
his
lordship
mother
with
the
mournful
intelligence
of
his
death
for
you
see
mr
simple
no
one
knew
that
his
lordship
was
dead
the
captain
of
the
transport
had
put
him
into
the
xebeque
alive
and
the
vessel
bound
to
gibraltar
had
received
him
as
they
imagined
the
captain
of
the
frigate
had
very
soon
afterwards
advices
from
gibraltar
stating
his
lordship
recovery
and
return
to
england
well
i
had
not
been
in
the
coach
more
than
five
minutes
when
who
should
get
in
but
a
gentleman
whom
i
had
met
at
the
besides
which
the
coachman
and
others
knew
me
very
well
when
i
arrived
in
london
i
still
wore
my
midshipman
uniform
i
went
to
an
hotel
recommended
to
me
as
i
afterwards
found
out
the
most
fashionable
in
town
my
title
still
following
me
i
now
determined
to
put
off
my
uniform
and
dress
in
plain
clothes
my
farce
was
over
i
went
to
bed
that
night
and
the
next
morning
made
my
appearance
in
a
suit
of
mufti
making
inquiry
of
the
waiter
which
was
the
best
conveyance
to
scotland
chay
and
four
my
lord
at
what
time
shall
i
order
it
replied
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
go
tomorrow
just
at
this
moment
in
came
the
master
of
the
hotel
with
the
in
his
hand
making
me
a
low
bow
and
pointing
to
the
insertion
of
my
arrival
at
his
hotel
among
the
fashionables
this
annoyed
me
and
now
that
i
found
how
difficult
it
was
to
get
rid
of
my
title
i
became
particularly
anxious
to
be
william
chucks
as
before
before
twelve
three
or
four
gentlemen
were
ushered
into
my
who
observing
my
arrival
in
that
damn
came
to
pay
their
respects
and
before
the
day
was
over
i
was
invited
and
by
a
dozen
people
i
found
that
i
could
not
retreat
and
i
went
away
with
the
stream
as
i
did
before
at
gibraltar
and
portsmouth
for
three
weeks
i
was
everywhere
and
if
i
found
it
agreeable
at
portsmouth
how
much
more
so
in
london
but
i
was
not
happy
mr
simple
because
i
was
a
cheat
every
moment
expecting
to
be
found
out
but
it
really
was
a
nice
thing
to
be
a
lord
at
last
the
play
was
over
i
had
been
enticed
by
some
young
men
into
a
where
they
intended
to
fleece
me
but
for
the
first
night
they
allowed
me
to
win
i
think
about
i
was
quite
delighted
with
my
success
and
had
agreed
to
meet
them
the
next
evening
but
when
i
was
at
breakfast
with
my
legs
crossed
reading
the
who
should
come
to
see
me
but
my
guardian
uncle
he
knew
his
nephew
features
too
well
to
be
deceived
and
my
not
recognising
him
proved
at
once
that
i
was
an
impostor
you
must
allow
me
to
hasten
over
the
scene
which
took
place
the
wrath
of
the
uncle
the
confusion
in
the
hotel
the
abuse
of
the
waiters
the
police
officer
and
being
dragged
into
a
hackney
coach
to
there
i
was
examined
and
confessed
all
the
uncle
was
so
glad
to
find
that
his
nephew
was
really
dead
that
he
felt
no
resentment
towards
me
and
as
after
all
i
had
only
assumed
a
name
but
had
cheated
nobody
except
the
landlord
at
portsmouth
i
was
sent
on
board
the
tender
off
the
tower
to
be
drafted
into
a
as
for
my
my
clothes
i
never
heard
any
more
of
them
they
were
seized
i
presume
by
the
landlord
of
the
hotel
for
my
bill
and
very
handsomely
he
must
have
paid
himself
i
had
two
rings
on
my
fingers
and
a
watch
in
my
pocket
when
i
was
sent
on
board
the
tender
and
i
stowed
them
away
very
carefully
i
had
also
a
few
pounds
in
my
purse
i
was
sent
round
to
plymouth
where
i
was
drafted
into
a
frigate
after
i
had
been
there
some
time
i
turned
the
watch
and
rings
into
money
and
bought
myself
a
good
kit
of
clothes
for
i
could
not
bear
to
be
dirty
i
was
put
into
the
and
no
one
knew
that
i
had
been
a
lord
you
found
some
difference
i
should
think
in
your
situation
yes
i
did
mr
simple
but
i
was
much
happier
i
could
not
forget
the
ladies
and
the
dinners
and
the
opera
and
all
the
delights
of
london
beside
the
respect
paid
to
my
title
and
i
often
sighed
for
them
but
the
police
officer
and
also
came
to
my
recollection
and
i
shuddered
at
the
remembrance
it
had
however
one
good
effect
i
determined
to
be
an
officer
if
i
could
and
learnt
my
duty
and
worked
my
way
up
to
and
thence
to
boatswain
and
i
know
my
duty
mr
simple
but
i
been
punished
for
my
folly
ever
since
i
formed
ideas
above
my
station
in
life
and
can
not
help
longing
to
be
a
gentleman
it
a
bad
thing
for
a
man
to
have
ideas
above
his
station
you
certainly
must
find
some
difference
between
the
company
in
london
and
that
of
the
warrant
officers
it
many
years
back
now
sir
but
i
ca
get
over
the
feeling
i
ca
with
them
at
all
a
man
may
have
the
feelings
of
a
gentleman
although
in
a
humble
capacity
but
how
can
i
be
intimate
with
such
people
as
mr
dispart
or
mr
muddle
the
carpenter
all
very
well
in
their
way
mr
simple
but
what
can
you
expect
from
officers
who
boil
their
in
a
hanging
in
the
ship
coppers
when
they
know
that
there
is
of
a
stove
allowed
them
to
cook
their
victuals
on
chapter
xv
i
go
on
service
and
am
made
prisoner
by
an
old
lady
who
not
able
to
obtain
my
hand
takes
part
of
my
finger
as
a
token
rescues
me
a
lee
shore
and
narrow
escape
two
or
three
days
after
this
conversation
with
mr
chucks
the
captain
ran
the
frigate
in
shore
and
when
within
five
miles
we
discovered
two
vessels
under
the
land
we
made
all
sail
in
chase
and
cut
them
off
from
escaping
round
a
sandy
point
which
they
attempted
to
weather
finding
that
they
could
not
effect
their
purpose
they
ran
on
shore
under
a
small
battery
of
two
guns
which
commenced
firing
upon
us
the
first
shot
which
whizzed
between
the
masts
had
to
me
a
most
terrific
sound
but
the
officers
and
men
laughed
at
it
so
of
course
i
pretended
to
do
the
same
but
in
reality
i
could
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
the
captain
ordered
the
starboard
watch
to
be
piped
to
quarters
and
the
boats
to
be
cleared
ready
for
hoisting
out
we
then
anchored
within
a
mile
of
the
battery
and
returned
the
fire
in
the
meantime
the
remainder
of
the
ship
company
hoisted
out
and
lowered
down
four
boats
which
were
manned
and
armed
to
storm
the
battery
i
was
very
anxious
to
go
on
service
and
who
had
command
of
the
first
cutter
allowed
me
to
go
with
him
on
condition
that
i
stowed
myself
away
under
the
foresheets
that
the
captain
might
not
see
me
before
the
boats
had
shoved
off
this
i
did
and
was
not
discovered
we
pulled
in
abreast
towards
the
battery
and
in
less
than
ten
minutes
the
boats
were
run
on
the
beach
and
we
jumped
out
the
frenchmen
fired
a
gun
at
us
as
we
pulled
close
to
the
shore
and
then
ran
away
so
that
we
took
possession
without
any
fighting
which
to
confess
the
truth
i
was
not
sorry
for
as
i
did
not
think
that
i
was
old
or
strong
enough
to
cope
hand
to
hand
with
a
man
there
were
a
few
fishermen
huts
close
to
the
battery
and
while
two
of
the
boats
went
on
board
of
the
vessels
to
see
if
they
could
be
got
off
and
others
were
spiking
the
guns
and
destroying
the
carriages
i
went
with
to
examine
them
they
were
deserted
by
the
people
as
might
have
been
supposed
but
there
was
a
great
quantity
of
fish
in
them
apparently
caught
that
morning
pointed
to
a
very
large
skate
murder
in
irish
cried
he
it
the
very
ghost
of
my
grandmother
we
have
her
if
it
only
for
the
family
likeness
peter
put
your
finger
into
the
gills
and
drag
her
down
to
the
boat
i
could
not
force
my
finger
into
the
gills
and
as
the
animal
appeared
quite
dead
i
hooked
my
finger
into
its
mouth
but
i
made
a
sad
mistake
for
the
animal
was
alive
and
immediately
closed
its
jaws
nipping
my
finger
to
the
bone
and
holding
it
so
tight
that
i
could
not
withdraw
it
and
the
pain
was
too
great
to
allow
me
to
pull
it
away
by
main
force
and
tear
my
finger
which
it
held
so
fast
there
i
was
caught
in
a
trap
and
made
a
prisoner
by
a
fortunately
i
hallooed
loud
enough
to
make
who
was
close
down
to
the
boats
with
a
large
codfish
under
each
arm
turn
round
and
come
to
my
assistance
at
first
he
could
not
help
me
from
laughing
so
much
but
at
last
he
forced
open
the
jaw
of
the
fish
with
his
cutlass
and
i
got
my
finger
out
but
very
badly
torn
indeed
i
then
took
off
my
garter
tied
it
round
the
tail
of
the
skate
and
dragged
it
to
the
boat
which
was
all
ready
to
shove
off
the
other
boats
had
found
it
impossible
to
get
the
vessels
off
without
unloading
so
in
pursuance
of
the
orders
they
were
set
on
fire
and
before
we
lost
sight
of
them
had
burnt
down
to
the
water
edge
my
finger
was
very
bad
for
three
weeks
and
the
officers
laughed
at
me
very
much
saying
that
i
narrowly
escaped
being
made
a
prisoner
of
by
an
old
maid
we
continued
our
cruise
along
the
coast
until
we
had
run
down
into
the
bay
of
arcason
where
we
captured
two
or
three
vessels
and
obliged
many
more
to
run
on
shore
and
here
we
had
an
instance
showing
how
very
important
it
is
that
a
captain
of
a
should
be
a
good
sailor
and
have
his
ship
in
such
discipline
as
to
be
strictly
obeyed
by
his
ship
company
i
heard
the
officers
unanimously
assert
after
the
danger
was
over
that
nothing
but
the
presence
of
mind
which
was
shown
by
captain
savage
could
have
saved
the
ship
and
her
crew
we
had
chased
a
convoy
of
vessels
to
the
bottom
of
the
bay
the
wind
was
very
fresh
when
we
hauled
off
after
running
them
on
shore
and
the
surf
on
the
beach
even
at
that
time
was
so
great
that
they
were
certain
to
go
to
pieces
before
they
could
be
got
afloat
again
we
were
obliged
to
the
topsails
as
soon
as
we
hauled
to
the
wind
and
the
weather
looked
very
threatening
in
an
hour
afterwards
the
whole
sky
was
covered
with
one
black
cloud
which
sank
so
low
as
nearly
to
touch
our
and
a
tremendous
sea
which
appeared
to
have
risen
up
almost
by
magic
rolled
in
upon
us
setting
the
vessel
on
a
dead
lee
shore
as
the
night
closed
in
it
blew
a
dreadful
gale
and
the
ship
was
nearly
buried
with
the
press
of
canvas
which
she
was
obliged
to
carry
for
had
we
we
should
have
been
under
storm
staysails
but
we
were
forced
to
carry
on
at
all
risks
that
we
might
claw
off
shore
the
sea
broke
over
as
we
lay
in
the
trough
deluging
us
with
water
from
the
forecastle
aft
to
the
binnacles
and
very
often
as
the
ship
descended
with
a
plunge
it
was
with
such
force
that
i
really
thought
she
would
divide
in
half
with
the
violence
of
the
shock
double
breechings
were
rove
on
the
guns
and
they
were
further
secured
with
tackles
and
strong
cleats
nailed
behind
the
trunnions
for
we
heeled
over
so
much
when
we
lurched
that
the
guns
were
wholly
supported
by
the
breechings
and
tackles
and
had
one
of
them
broken
loose
it
must
have
burst
right
through
the
lee
side
of
the
ship
and
she
must
have
foundered
the
captain
first
lieutenant
and
most
of
the
officers
remained
on
deck
during
the
whole
of
the
night
and
really
what
with
the
howling
of
the
wind
the
violence
of
the
rain
the
washing
of
the
water
about
the
decks
the
working
of
the
and
the
creaking
and
groaning
of
the
timbers
i
thought
that
we
must
inevitably
have
been
lost
and
i
said
my
prayers
at
least
a
dozen
times
during
the
night
for
i
felt
it
impossible
to
go
to
bed
i
had
often
wished
out
of
curiosity
that
i
might
be
in
a
gale
of
wind
but
i
little
thought
it
was
to
have
been
a
scene
of
this
description
or
anything
half
so
dreadful
what
made
it
more
appalling
was
that
we
were
on
a
lee
shore
and
the
consultations
of
the
captain
and
officers
and
the
eagerness
with
which
they
looked
out
for
daylight
told
us
that
we
had
other
dangers
to
encounter
besides
the
storm
at
last
the
morning
broke
and
the
man
upon
the
gangway
called
out
land
on
the
lee
beam
i
perceived
the
master
dash
his
fist
against
the
as
if
with
vexation
and
walk
away
without
saying
a
word
and
looking
very
grave
up
there
mr
wilson
said
the
captain
to
the
second
lieutenant
and
see
how
far
the
land
trends
forward
and
whether
you
can
distinguish
the
point
the
second
lieutenant
went
up
the
and
pointed
with
his
hand
to
about
two
points
before
the
beam
do
you
see
two
hillocks
inland
yes
sir
replied
the
second
lieutenant
then
it
is
so
observed
the
captain
to
the
master
and
if
we
weather
it
we
shall
have
more
keep
her
full
and
let
her
go
through
the
water
do
you
hear
ay
ay
sir
thus
and
no
nearer
my
man
ease
her
with
a
spoke
or
two
when
she
sends
but
be
careful
or
she
take
the
wheel
out
of
your
hands
it
really
was
a
very
awful
sight
when
the
ship
was
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
you
could
distinguish
nothing
but
a
waste
of
tumultuous
water
but
when
she
was
borne
up
on
the
summit
of
the
enormous
waves
you
then
looked
down
as
it
were
upon
a
low
sandy
coast
close
to
you
and
covered
with
foam
and
breakers
she
behaves
nobly
observed
the
captain
stepping
aft
to
the
binnacle
and
looking
at
the
compass
if
the
wind
does
not
baffle
us
we
shall
weather
the
captain
had
scarcely
time
to
make
the
observation
when
the
sails
shivered
and
flapped
like
thunder
up
with
the
helm
what
are
you
about
the
wind
has
headed
us
sir
replied
the
coolly
the
captain
and
master
remained
at
the
binnacle
watching
the
compass
and
when
the
sails
were
again
full
she
had
broken
off
two
points
and
the
point
of
land
was
only
a
little
on
the
lee
bow
we
must
wear
her
round
mr
falcon
hands
wear
ship
ready
oh
ready
she
has
come
up
again
cried
the
master
who
was
at
the
binnacle
hold
fast
there
a
minute
how
her
head
now
as
she
was
before
she
broke
off
sir
pipe
belay
said
the
captain
falcon
continued
he
if
she
breaks
off
again
we
may
have
no
room
to
wear
indeed
there
is
so
little
room
now
that
i
must
run
the
risk
which
cable
was
ranged
last
night
the
best
bower
yes
sir
jump
down
then
and
see
it
and
stoppered
at
thirty
fathoms
see
it
well
done
our
lives
may
depend
upon
it
the
ship
continued
to
hold
her
course
good
and
we
were
within
half
a
mile
of
the
point
and
fully
expected
to
weather
it
when
again
the
wet
and
heavy
sails
flapped
in
the
wind
and
the
ship
broke
off
two
points
as
before
the
officers
and
seamen
were
aghast
for
the
ship
head
was
right
on
to
the
breakers
luff
now
all
you
can
cried
the
captain
send
the
men
aft
directly
my
lads
there
is
no
time
for
words
i
am
going
to
the
ship
for
there
is
no
room
to
wear
the
only
chance
you
have
of
safety
is
to
be
cool
watch
my
eye
and
execute
my
orders
with
precision
away
to
your
stations
for
tacking
ship
hands
by
the
best
bower
anchor
mr
wilson
attend
below
with
the
carpenter
and
his
mates
ready
to
cut
away
the
cable
at
the
moment
that
i
give
the
order
silence
there
fore
and
aft
keep
her
full
again
for
stays
mind
you
ease
the
helm
down
when
i
tell
you
about
a
minute
passed
before
the
captain
gave
any
further
orders
the
ship
had
closed
to
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
the
beach
and
the
waves
curled
and
topped
around
us
bearing
us
down
upon
the
shore
which
presented
one
continued
surface
of
foam
extending
to
within
half
a
cable
length
of
our
position
the
captain
waved
his
hand
in
silence
to
the
at
the
wheel
and
the
helm
was
put
down
the
ship
turned
slowly
to
the
wind
pitching
and
chopping
as
the
sails
were
spilling
when
she
had
lost
her
way
the
captain
gave
the
order
let
go
the
anchor
we
will
haul
all
at
once
mr
falcon
said
the
captain
not
a
word
was
spoken
the
men
went
to
the
fore
brace
which
had
not
been
manned
most
of
them
knew
although
i
did
not
that
if
the
ship
head
did
not
go
round
the
other
way
we
should
be
on
shore
and
among
the
breakers
in
half
a
minute
i
thought
at
the
time
that
the
captain
had
said
that
he
would
haul
all
the
yards
at
once
there
appeared
to
be
doubt
or
dissent
on
the
countenance
of
mr
falcon
and
i
was
afterwards
told
that
he
had
not
agreed
with
the
captain
but
he
was
too
good
an
officer
and
knew
that
there
was
no
time
for
discussion
to
make
any
remark
and
the
event
proved
that
the
captain
was
right
at
last
the
ship
was
head
to
wind
and
the
captain
gave
the
signal
the
yards
flew
round
with
such
a
creaking
noise
that
i
thought
the
masts
had
gone
over
the
side
and
the
next
moment
the
wind
had
caught
the
sails
and
the
ship
which
for
a
moment
or
two
had
been
on
an
even
keel
careened
over
to
her
gunnel
with
its
force
the
captain
who
stood
upon
the
rails
holding
by
the
ordered
the
helm
amidships
looked
full
at
the
sails
and
then
at
the
cable
which
grew
broad
upon
the
weather
bow
and
held
the
ship
from
nearing
the
shore
at
last
he
cried
cut
away
the
cable
a
few
strokes
of
the
axes
were
heard
and
then
the
cable
flew
out
of
the
hawsehole
in
a
blaze
of
fire
from
the
violence
of
the
friction
and
disappeared
under
a
huge
wave
which
struck
us
on
the
and
deluged
us
with
water
fore
and
aft
but
we
were
now
on
the
other
tack
and
the
ship
regained
her
way
and
we
had
evidently
increased
our
distance
from
the
land
my
lads
said
the
captain
to
the
ship
company
you
have
behaved
well
and
i
thank
you
but
i
must
tell
you
honestly
that
we
have
more
difficulties
to
get
through
we
have
to
weather
a
point
of
the
bay
on
this
tack
mr
falcon
splice
the
and
call
the
watch
how
her
head
by
southerly
sir
very
well
let
her
go
through
the
water
and
the
captain
beckoning
to
the
master
to
follow
him
went
down
into
the
cabin
as
our
immediate
danger
was
over
i
went
down
into
the
berth
to
see
if
i
could
get
anything
for
breakfast
where
i
found
and
two
or
three
more
by
the
powers
it
was
as
nate
a
thing
as
ever
i
saw
done
observed
the
slightest
mistake
as
to
time
or
management
and
at
this
moment
the
flatfish
would
have
been
dubbing
at
our
ugly
carcases
peter
you
not
fond
of
flatfish
are
you
my
boy
we
may
thank
heaven
and
the
captain
i
can
tell
you
that
my
lads
but
now
where
the
chart
robinson
hand
me
down
the
parallel
rules
and
compasses
peter
they
are
in
the
corner
of
the
shelf
here
we
are
now
a
devilish
sight
too
near
this
infernal
point
who
knows
how
her
head
is
i
do
i
heard
the
tell
the
captain
by
s
southerly
let
me
see
continued
variation
lee
way
rather
too
large
an
allowance
of
that
i
afraid
but
however
we
give
her
points
the
would
blush
to
make
any
more
under
any
circumstances
here
the
compass
now
we
see
and
advanced
the
parallel
rule
from
the
compass
to
the
spot
where
the
ship
was
placed
on
the
chart
bother
you
see
it
as
much
as
she
do
to
weather
the
other
point
now
on
this
tack
and
that
what
the
captain
meant
when
he
told
us
we
had
more
difficulty
i
could
have
taken
my
bible
oath
that
we
were
clear
of
everything
if
the
wind
held
see
what
the
distance
is
said
robinson
it
was
measured
and
proved
to
be
thirteen
miles
only
thirteen
miles
and
if
we
do
weather
we
shall
do
very
well
for
the
bay
is
deep
beyond
it
a
rocky
point
you
see
just
by
way
of
variety
well
my
lads
i
a
piece
of
comfort
for
you
anyhow
it
not
long
that
you
be
kept
in
suspense
for
by
one
this
day
you
either
be
congratulating
each
other
upon
your
good
luck
or
you
be
past
praying
for
come
put
up
the
chart
for
i
hate
to
look
at
melancholy
prospects
and
steward
see
what
you
can
find
in
the
way
of
comfort
some
bread
and
cheese
with
the
remains
of
yesterday
boiled
pork
were
put
on
the
table
with
a
bottle
of
rum
procured
at
the
time
they
spliced
the
mainbrace
but
we
were
all
too
anxious
to
eat
much
and
one
by
one
returned
on
deck
to
see
how
the
weather
was
and
if
the
wind
at
all
favoured
us
on
deck
the
superior
officers
were
in
conversation
with
the
captain
who
had
expressed
the
same
fear
that
had
in
our
berth
the
men
who
knew
what
they
had
to
expect
for
this
sort
of
intelligence
is
soon
communicated
through
a
ship
were
assembled
in
knots
looking
very
grave
but
at
the
same
time
not
wanting
in
confidence
they
knew
that
they
could
trust
to
the
captain
as
far
as
skill
or
courage
could
avail
them
and
sailors
are
too
sanguine
to
despair
even
at
the
last
moment
as
for
myself
i
felt
such
admiration
for
the
captain
after
what
i
had
witnessed
that
morning
that
whenever
the
idea
came
over
me
that
in
all
probability
i
should
be
lost
in
a
few
hours
i
could
not
help
acknowledging
how
much
more
serious
it
was
that
such
a
man
should
be
lost
to
his
country
i
do
not
intend
to
say
that
it
consoled
me
but
it
certainly
made
me
still
more
regret
the
chances
with
which
we
were
threatened
before
twelve
the
rocky
point
which
we
so
much
dreaded
was
in
sight
broad
on
the
and
if
the
low
sandy
coast
appeared
terrible
how
much
more
did
this
even
at
a
distance
the
black
masses
of
rock
covered
with
foam
which
each
minute
dashed
up
in
the
air
higher
than
our
lower
the
captain
eyed
it
for
some
minutes
in
silence
as
if
in
calculation
mr
falcon
said
he
at
last
we
must
put
the
mainsail
on
her
she
never
can
bear
it
sir
she
bear
it
was
the
reply
send
the
men
aft
to
the
mainsheet
see
that
careful
men
attend
the
buntlines
the
mainsail
was
set
and
the
effect
of
it
upon
the
ship
was
tremendous
she
careened
over
so
that
her
lee
channels
were
under
the
water
and
when
pressed
by
a
sea
the
of
the
and
gangway
were
afloat
she
now
reminded
me
of
a
goaded
and
fiery
horse
mad
with
the
stimulus
applied
not
rising
as
before
but
forcing
herself
through
whole
seas
and
dividing
the
waves
which
poured
in
one
continual
torrent
from
the
forecastle
down
upon
the
decks
below
four
men
were
secured
to
the
wheel
the
sailors
were
obliged
to
cling
to
prevent
being
washed
away
the
ropes
were
thrown
in
confusion
to
leeward
the
shot
rolled
out
of
the
lockers
and
every
eye
was
fixed
aloft
watching
the
masts
which
were
expected
every
moment
to
go
over
the
side
a
heavy
sea
struck
us
on
the
broadside
and
it
was
some
moments
before
the
ship
appeared
to
recover
herself
she
reeled
trembled
and
stopped
her
way
as
if
it
had
stupefied
her
the
first
lieutenant
looked
at
the
captain
as
if
to
say
this
will
not
do
it
is
our
only
chance
answered
the
captain
to
the
appeal
that
the
ship
went
faster
through
the
water
and
held
a
better
wind
was
certain
but
just
before
we
arrived
at
the
point
the
gale
increased
in
force
if
anything
starts
we
are
lost
sir
observed
the
first
lieutenant
again
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
it
replied
the
captain
in
a
calm
tone
but
as
i
said
before
and
you
must
now
be
aware
it
is
our
only
chance
the
consequence
of
any
carelessness
or
neglect
in
the
fitting
and
securing
of
the
rigging
will
be
felt
now
and
this
danger
if
we
escape
it
ought
to
remind
us
how
much
we
have
to
answer
for
if
we
neglect
our
duty
the
lives
of
a
whole
ship
company
may
be
sacrificed
by
the
neglect
or
incompetence
of
an
officer
when
in
harbour
i
will
pay
you
the
compliment
falcon
to
say
that
i
feel
convinced
that
the
masts
of
the
ship
are
as
secure
as
knowledge
and
attention
can
make
them
the
first
lieutenant
thanked
the
captain
for
his
good
opinion
and
hoped
it
would
not
be
the
last
compliment
which
he
paid
him
i
hope
not
too
but
a
few
minutes
will
decide
the
point
the
ship
was
now
within
two
cables
lengths
of
the
rocky
point
some
few
of
the
men
i
observed
to
clasp
their
hands
but
most
of
them
were
silently
taking
off
their
jackets
and
kicking
off
their
shoes
that
they
might
not
lose
a
chance
of
escape
provided
the
ship
struck
be
touch
and
go
indeed
falcon
observed
the
captain
for
i
had
clung
to
the
close
to
them
for
the
last
that
the
mainsail
had
been
set
come
aft
you
and
i
must
take
the
helm
we
shall
want
there
and
only
there
now
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
went
aft
and
took
the
forespokes
of
the
wheel
and
at
a
sign
made
by
the
captain
laid
hold
of
the
spokes
behind
him
an
old
kept
his
station
at
the
fourth
the
roaring
of
the
seas
on
the
rocks
with
the
howling
of
the
wind
were
dreadful
but
the
sight
was
more
dreadful
than
the
noise
for
a
few
moments
i
shut
my
eyes
but
anxiety
forced
me
to
open
them
again
as
near
as
i
could
judge
we
were
not
twenty
yards
from
the
rocks
at
the
time
that
the
ship
passed
abreast
of
them
we
were
in
the
midst
of
the
foam
which
boiled
around
us
and
as
the
ship
was
driven
nearer
to
them
and
careened
with
the
wave
i
thought
that
our
would
have
touched
the
rock
and
at
this
moment
a
gust
of
wind
came
on
which
laid
the
ship
on
her
and
checked
her
progress
through
the
water
while
the
accumulated
noise
was
deafening
a
few
moments
more
the
ship
dragged
on
another
wave
dashed
over
her
and
spent
itself
upon
the
rocks
while
the
spray
was
dashed
back
from
them
and
returned
upon
the
decks
the
main
rock
was
within
ten
yards
of
her
counter
when
another
gust
of
wind
laid
us
on
our
the
foresail
and
mainsail
split
and
were
blown
clean
out
of
the
the
ship
righted
trembling
fore
and
aft
i
looked
astern
the
rocks
were
to
windward
on
our
quarter
and
we
were
safe
i
thought
at
the
time
that
the
ship
relieved
of
her
courses
and
again
lifting
over
the
waves
was
not
a
bad
similitude
of
the
relief
felt
by
us
all
at
that
moment
and
like
her
we
trembled
as
we
panted
with
the
sudden
reaction
and
felt
the
removal
of
the
intense
anxiety
which
oppressed
our
breasts
the
captain
resigned
the
helm
and
walked
aft
to
look
at
the
point
which
was
now
broad
on
the
weather
quarter
in
a
minute
or
two
he
desired
mr
falcon
to
get
new
sails
up
and
bend
them
and
then
went
below
to
his
cabin
i
am
sure
it
was
to
thank
god
for
our
deliverance
i
did
most
fervently
not
only
then
but
when
i
went
to
my
hammock
at
night
we
were
now
comparatively
safe
in
a
few
hours
completely
so
for
strange
to
say
immediately
after
we
had
weathered
the
rocks
the
gale
abated
and
before
morning
we
had
a
reef
out
of
the
topsails
it
was
my
afternoon
watch
and
perceiving
mr
chucks
on
the
forecastle
i
went
forward
to
him
and
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
it
thought
of
it
sir
replied
he
why
i
always
think
bad
of
it
when
the
elements
wo
allow
my
whistle
to
be
heard
and
i
consider
it
hardly
fair
play
i
never
care
if
we
are
left
to
our
own
exertions
but
how
is
it
possible
for
a
ship
company
to
do
their
best
when
they
can
not
hear
the
boatswain
pipe
however
god
be
thanked
nevertheless
and
make
better
christians
of
us
all
as
for
that
carpenter
he
is
mad
just
before
we
weathered
the
point
he
told
me
that
it
was
just
the
same
and
odd
years
ago
i
do
believe
that
on
his
and
he
was
not
far
from
a
very
hard
one
yesterday
he
will
tell
us
how
he
died
so
many
thousand
years
ago
of
the
same
complaint
and
that
gunner
of
ours
is
a
fool
would
you
believe
it
mr
simple
he
went
crying
about
the
decks
my
poor
guns
what
will
become
of
them
if
they
break
loose
he
appeared
to
consider
it
of
no
consequence
if
the
ship
and
company
were
all
lost
provided
that
his
guns
were
safely
landed
on
the
beach
dispart
said
i
at
last
me
to
observe
in
the
most
delicate
way
in
the
world
that
you
a
d
d
old
fool
you
see
mr
simple
it
the
duty
of
an
officer
to
generalise
and
be
attentive
to
parts
only
in
consideration
of
the
safety
of
the
whole
i
look
after
my
anchors
and
cables
as
i
do
after
the
rigging
not
that
i
care
for
any
of
them
in
particular
but
because
the
safety
of
a
ship
depends
upon
her
being
well
found
i
might
just
as
well
cry
because
we
sacrificed
an
anchor
and
cable
yesterday
morning
to
save
the
ship
from
going
on
shore
very
true
mr
chucks
replied
i
private
feelings
continued
he
must
always
be
sacrificed
for
the
public
service
as
you
know
the
lower
deck
was
full
of
water
and
all
our
cabins
and
chests
were
afloat
but
i
did
not
think
then
about
my
shirts
and
look
at
them
now
all
blowing
out
in
the
forerigging
without
a
particle
of
starch
left
in
the
collars
or
the
frills
i
shall
not
be
able
to
appear
as
an
officer
ought
to
do
for
the
whole
of
the
cruise
as
he
said
this
the
cooper
going
forward
passed
by
him
and
jostled
him
in
passing
beg
pardon
sir
said
the
man
but
the
ship
lurched
the
ship
lurched
did
it
replied
the
boatswain
who
i
am
afraid
was
not
in
the
best
of
humours
about
his
wardrobe
and
pray
mr
cooper
why
has
heaven
granted
you
two
legs
with
joints
at
the
knees
except
to
enable
you
to
counteract
the
horizontal
deviation
do
you
suppose
they
were
meant
for
nothing
but
to
work
round
a
cask
with
hark
sir
did
you
take
me
for
a
post
to
scrub
your
pig
hide
against
allow
me
just
to
observe
mr
cooper
just
to
insinuate
that
when
you
pass
an
officer
it
is
your
duty
to
keep
at
a
respectable
distance
and
not
to
soil
his
clothes
with
your
rusty
iron
jacket
do
you
comprehend
me
sir
or
will
this
make
you
recollect
in
future
the
rattan
was
raised
and
descended
in
a
shower
of
blows
until
the
cooper
made
his
escape
into
the
head
there

that
you
contaminating
quintessence
of
a

beg
your
pardon
mr
simple
for
interrupting
the
conversation
but
when
duty
calls
we
must
obey
very
true
mr
chucks
it
now
striking
seven
bells
and
i
must
call
the
master

news
from
home
a
party
employed
at
gibraltar
more
particulars
in
the
life
of
mr
chucks
a
brush
with
the
enemy
a
and
a
lasting
impression
a
few
days
afterwards
a
cutter
joined
us
from
plymouth
with
orders
for
the
frigate
to
proceed
forthwith
to
gibraltar
where
we
should
learn
our
destination
we
were
all
very
glad
of
this
for
we
had
had
quite
enough
of
cruising
in
the
bay
of
biscay
and
as
we
understood
that
we
were
to
be
stationed
in
the
mediterranean
we
hoped
to
exchange
gales
of
wind
and
severe
weather
for
fine
breezes
and
a
bright
sky
the
cutter
brought
out
our
letters
and
newspapers
i
never
felt
more
happy
than
i
did
when
i
found
one
put
into
my
hands
it
is
necessary
to
be
far
from
home
and
friends
to
feel
the
real
delight
of
receiving
a
letter
i
went
down
into
the
most
solitary
place
in
the
steerage
that
i
might
enjoy
it
without
interruption
i
cried
with
pleasure
before
i
opened
it
but
i
cried
a
great
deal
more
with
grief
after
i
had
read
the
contents
for
my
eldest
brother
tom
was
dead
of
a
typhus
fever
poor
tom
when
i
called
to
mind
what
tricks
he
used
to
play
me
how
he
used
to
borrow
my
money
and
never
pay
me
and
how
he
used
to
thrash
me
and
make
me
obey
him
because
he
was
my
eldest
brother
i
shed
a
torrent
of
tears
at
his
loss
and
then
i
reflected
how
miserable
my
poor
mother
must
be
and
i
cried
still
more
what
the
matter
spooney
said
coming
up
to
me
who
has
been
licking
you
now
o
nobody
replied
i
but
my
eldest
brother
tom
is
dead
and
i
have
no
other
well
peter
i
dare
say
that
your
brother
was
a
very
good
brother
but
i
tell
you
a
secret
when
you
lived
long
enough
to
have
a
beard
to
scrape
at
you
know
better
than
to
make
a
fuss
about
an
elder
brother
but
you
a
good
innocent
boy
just
now
so
i
wo
thrash
you
for
it
come
dry
your
eyes
peter
and
never
mind
it
we
drink
his
health
and
long
life
to
him
after
supper
and
then
never
think
any
more
about
it
i
was
very
melancholy
for
a
few
days
but
it
was
so
delightful
running
down
the
portuguese
and
spanish
coasts
the
weather
was
so
warm
and
the
sea
so
smooth
that
i
am
afraid
i
forgot
my
brother
death
sooner
than
i
ought
to
have
done
but
my
spirits
were
cheered
up
and
the
novelty
of
the
scene
prevented
me
from
thinking
every
one
too
was
so
gay
and
happy
that
i
could
not
well
be
otherwise
in
a
fortnight
we
anchored
in
gibraltar
bay
and
the
ship
was
stripped
to
refit
there
was
so
much
duty
to
be
done
that
i
did
not
like
to
go
on
shore
indeed
mr
falcon
had
refused
some
of
my
messmates
and
i
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
although
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
a
place
which
was
considered
so
extraordinary
one
afternoon
i
was
looking
over
the
gangway
as
the
people
were
at
supper
and
mr
falcon
came
up
to
me
and
said
well
mr
simple
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
replied
touching
my
hat
that
i
was
wondering
how
they
had
cut
out
the
solid
rock
into
galleries
and
that
they
must
be
very
curious
that
is
to
say
that
you
are
very
curious
to
see
them
well
then
since
you
have
been
very
attentive
to
your
duty
and
have
not
asked
to
go
on
shore
i
will
give
you
leave
to
go
morning
and
stay
till
i
was
very
much
pleased
at
this
as
the
officers
had
a
general
invitation
to
dine
with
the
mess
and
all
who
could
obtain
leave
being
requested
to
come
i
was
enabled
to
join
the
party
the
first
lieutenant
had
excused
himself
on
the
plea
of
there
being
so
much
to
attend
to
on
board
but
most
of
the
officers
and
some
of
the
midshipmen
obtained
leave
we
walked
about
the
town
and
fortifications
until
and
then
we
proceeded
to
the
barracks
the
dinner
was
very
good
and
we
were
all
very
merry
but
after
the
dessert
had
been
brought
in
i
slipped
away
with
a
young
ensign
who
took
me
all
over
the
galleries
and
explained
everything
to
me
which
was
a
much
better
way
of
employing
my
time
than
doing
as
the
others
did
which
the
reader
will
acknowledge
i
was
at
the
before
the
boat
was
there
but
no
officers
made
their
appearance
the
gun
fired
the
drawbridge
was
hauled
up
and
i
was
afraid
that
i
should
be
blamed
but
the
boat
was
not
ordered
to
shove
off
as
it
was
waiting
for
commissioned
officers
about
an
hour
afterwards
when
it
was
quite
dark
the
sentry
pointed
his
arms
and
challenged
a
person
advancing
with
who
comes
there
naval
officer
drunk
on
a
wheelbarrow
was
the
reply
in
a
loud
singing
voice
upon
which
the
sentry
recovered
his
arms
singing
in
return
pass
naval
officer
drunk
on
a
wheelbarrow
and
all
well
and
then
appeared
a
soldier
in
his
fatigue
dress
wheeling
down
the
third
lieutenant
in
a
wheelbarrow
so
tipsy
that
he
could
not
stand
or
speak
then
the
sentry
challenged
again
and
the
answer
was
another
naval
officer
drunk
on
a
wheelbarrow
upon
which
the
sentry
replied
as
before
pass
another
naval
officer
drunk
on
a
wheelbarrow
and
all
well
this
was
my
friend
almost
as
bad
as
the
third
lieutenant
and
so
they
continued
for
ten
minutes
challenging
and
passing
until
they
wheeled
down
the
remainder
of
the
party
with
the
exception
of
the
second
lieutenant
who
walked
arm
and
arm
with
the
officer
who
brought
down
the
order
for
lowering
the
drawbridge
i
was
much
shocked
for
i
considered
it
very
disgraceful
but
i
afterwards
was
told
which
certainly
admitted
of
some
excuse
that
the
mess
were
notorious
for
never
permitting
any
of
their
guests
to
leave
the
table
sober
they
were
all
safely
put
into
the
boat
and
i
am
glad
to
say
the
first
lieutenant
was
in
bed
and
did
not
see
them
but
i
could
not
help
acknowledging
the
truth
of
an
observation
made
by
one
of
the
men
as
the
officers
were
handed
into
the
boat
i
say
bill
if
were
what
a
precious
twisting
we
should
get
at
six
bells
the
ship
remained
in
gibraltar
bay
about
three
weeks
during
which
time
we
had
refitted
the
rigging
fore
and
aft
restowed
and
cleaned
the
hold
and
painted
outside
she
never
looked
more
beautiful
than
she
did
when
in
obedience
to
our
orders
we
made
sail
to
join
the
admiral
we
passed
europa
point
with
a
fair
wind
and
at
sunset
we
were
sixty
miles
from
the
rock
yet
it
was
distinctly
to
be
seen
like
a
blue
cloud
but
the
outline
perfectly
correct
i
mention
this
as
perhaps
my
reader
would
not
have
believed
that
it
was
possible
to
see
land
at
such
a
distance
we
steered
for
cape
de
gatte
and
we
were
next
day
close
in
shore
i
was
very
much
delighted
with
the
spanish
coast
mountain
upon
mountain
hill
upon
hill
covered
with
vines
nearly
to
their
summits
we
might
have
gone
on
shore
at
some
places
for
at
that
time
we
were
friendly
with
the
spaniards
but
the
captain
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
join
the
admiral
we
had
very
light
winds
and
a
day
or
two
afterwards
we
were
off
valencia
nearly
becalmed
i
was
on
the
gangway
looking
through
a
telescope
at
the
houses
and
gardens
round
the
city
when
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
came
up
to
me
mr
simple
oblige
me
with
that
glass
a
moment
i
wish
to
see
if
a
building
remains
there
which
i
have
some
reason
to
remember
what
were
you
ever
on
shore
there
yes
i
was
mr
simple
and
nearly
but
i
got
off
again
without
much
damage
how
do
you
mean
were
you
wrecked
then
not
my
ship
mr
simple
but
my
peace
of
mind
was
for
some
time
but
it
many
years
ago
when
i
was
first
made
boatswain
of
a
corvette
during
this
conversation
he
was
looking
through
the
telescope
yes
there
it
is
said
he
i
have
it
in
the
field
look
mr
simple
do
you
see
a
small
church
with
a
spire
of
glazed
tiles
shining
like
a
needle
yes
i
do
well
then
just
above
it
a
little
to
the
right
there
is
a
long
white
house
with
four
small
windows
below
the
grove
of
i
see
it
replied
i
but
what
about
that
house
mr
chucks
why
thereby
hangs
a
tale
replied
he
giving
a
sigh
which
raised
and
then
lowered
the
frill
of
his
shirt
at
least
six
inches
why
what
is
the
mystery
mr
chucks
i
tell
you
mr
simple
with
one
who
lived
in
that
house
i
was
for
the
first
and
for
the
last
time
in
love
indeed
i
should
like
very
much
to
hear
the
story
so
you
shall
mr
simple
but
i
must
beg
that
you
will
not
mention
it
as
young
gentlemen
are
apt
to
quiz
and
i
think
that
being
quizzed
hurts
my
authority
with
the
men
it
is
now
about
sixteen
years
back
we
were
then
on
good
terms
with
the
spaniards
as
we
are
now
i
was
then
little
more
than
thirty
years
old
and
had
just
received
my
warrant
as
boatswain
i
was
considered
a
young
man
at
that
time
although
lately
i
have
to
a
certain
degree
got
the
better
of
that
well
i
consider
you
a
remarkably
man
now
mr
chucks
thank
you
mr
simple
but
nothing
improves
by
age
that
i
know
of
except
rum
i
used
to
dress
very
smart
and
the
boatswain
when
i
was
on
shore
and
perhaps
i
had
not
lost
so
much
of
the
polish
i
had
picked
up
in
good
society
one
evening
i
was
walking
in
the
plaza
when
i
saw
a
female
ahead
who
appeared
to
be
the
prettiest
moulded
little
vessel
that
i
ever
cast
my
eyes
on
i
followed
in
her
wake
and
examined
her
such
a
clean
run
i
never
beheld
so
neat
too
in
all
her
rigging
everything
so
nicely
stowed
under
hatches
and
then
she
sailed
along
in
such
a
style
at
one
moment
lifting
so
lightly
just
like
a
frigate
with
her
topsails
on
the
caps
that
ca
help
going
along
at
another
time
as
she
turned
a
corner
sharp
up
in
the
wind
wake
as
straight
as
an
arrow
no
leeway
i
made
all
sail
to
sheer
alongside
of
her
and
when
under
quarter
examined
her
close
never
saw
such
a
fine
swell
in
the
counter
and
all
so
trim
no
ropes
towing
overboard
well
mr
simple
i
said
to
myself
n
it
if
her
figurehead
and
bows
be
finished
off
by
the
same
builder
she
perfect
so
i
shot
ahead
and
yawed
a
little
caught
a
peep
at
her
through
her
veil
and
saw
two
black
eyes
as
bright
as
beads
and
as
large
as
damsons
i
saw
quite
enough
and
not
wishing
to
frighten
her
i
dropped
astern
shortly
afterwards
she
altered
her
course
steering
for
that
white
house
just
as
she
was
abreast
of
it
and
i
playing
about
her
weather
quarter
the
priests
came
by
in
procession
taking
the
to
somebody
who
was
dying
my
little
frigate
lowered
her
sails
out
of
respect
as
other
nations
used
to
do
and
ought
now
and
be
d
d
to
them
whenever
they
pass
the
flag
of
old
england
how
do
you
mean
inquired
i
i
mean
that
she
spread
her
white
handkerchief
which
fluttered
in
her
hand
as
she
went
along
and
knelt
down
upon
it
on
one
knee
i
did
the
same
because
i
was
obliged
to
to
keep
my
station
and
i
thought
that
if
she
saw
me
it
would
please
her
when
she
got
up
i
was
on
my
legs
also
but
in
my
hurry
i
had
not
chosen
a
very
clean
place
and
i
found
out
when
i
got
up
again
that
my
white
jean
trousers
were
in
a
shocking
mess
the
young
lady
turned
round
and
seeing
my
misfortune
laughed
and
then
went
into
the
white
house
while
i
stood
there
like
a
fool
first
looking
at
the
door
of
the
house
and
then
at
my
trousers
however
i
thought
that
i
might
make
it
the
means
of
being
acquainted
with
her
so
i
went
to
the
door
and
knocked
an
old
gentleman
in
a
large
cloak
who
was
her
father
came
out
i
pointed
to
my
trousers
and
requested
him
in
spanish
to
allow
me
a
little
water
to
clean
them
the
daughter
then
came
from
within
and
told
her
father
how
the
accident
had
happened
the
old
gentleman
was
surprised
that
an
english
officer
was
so
good
a
christian
and
appeared
to
be
pleased
he
asked
me
very
politely
to
come
in
and
sent
an
old
woman
for
some
water
i
observed
that
he
was
smoking
a
bit
of
paper
and
having
very
fortunately
about
a
couple
of
dozen
of
real
havannahs
in
my
pocket
for
i
never
smoke
anything
else
mr
simple
it
being
my
opinion
that
no
gentleman
can
i
took
them
out
and
begged
his
acceptance
of
them
his
eyes
glistened
at
the
sight
of
them
but
he
refused
to
take
more
than
one
however
i
insisted
upon
his
taking
the
whole
bundle
telling
him
that
i
had
plenty
more
on
board
reserving
one
for
myself
that
i
might
smoke
it
with
him
he
then
requested
me
to
sit
down
and
the
old
woman
brought
some
sour
wine
which
i
declared
was
very
good
although
it
made
me
quite
ill
afterwards
he
inquired
of
me
whether
i
was
a
good
christian
i
replied
that
i
was
i
knew
that
he
meant
a
catholic
for
they
call
us
heretics
mr
simple
the
daughter
then
came
in
without
her
veil
and
she
was
perfection
but
i
did
not
look
at
her
or
pay
her
any
attention
after
the
first
salutation
i
was
so
afraid
of
making
the
old
gentleman
suspicious
he
then
asked
what
i
was
what
sort
of
officer
was
i
captain
i
replied
that
i
was
not
was
i
which
means
lieutenant
i
answered
that
i
was
not
again
but
with
an
air
of
contempt
as
if
i
was
something
better
what
was
i
then
i
did
not
know
the
spanish
for
boatswain
and
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
ashamed
of
my
condition
i
knew
that
there
was
an
officer
in
spain
called
corregidor
which
means
a
corrector
in
english
or
one
who
punishes
now
i
thought
that
quite
near
enough
for
my
purpose
and
i
replied
that
i
was
the
corregidor
now
mr
simple
a
corregidor
in
spain
is
a
person
of
rank
and
consequence
so
they
imagined
that
i
must
be
the
same
and
they
appeared
to
be
pleased
the
young
lady
then
inquired
if
i
was
of
good
family
whether
i
was
a
gentleman
or
not
i
replied
that
i
hoped
so
i
remained
with
them
for
more
when
my
segar
was
finished
i
then
rose
and
thanking
the
old
gentleman
for
his
civility
begged
that
i
might
be
allowed
to
bring
him
a
few
more
segars
and
took
my
leave
the
daughter
opened
the
street
door
and
i
could
not
refrain
from
taking
her
hand
and
kissing
it
where
mr
chucks
call
the
boatswain
there
forward
hallooed
out
the
lieutenant
here
i
am
sir
replied
mr
chucks
hastening
aft
and
leaving
me
and
his
story
the
captain
of
the
maintop
reports
the
breast
backstay
much
chafed
in
the
serving
go
up
and
examine
it
said
the
first
lieutenant
yes
sir
replied
the
boatswain
who
immediately
went
up
the
rigging
and
mr
simple
attend
to
the
men
scraping
the
spots
off
the
yes
sir
replied
i
and
thus
our
conversation
was
broken
up
the
weather
changed
that
night
and
we
had
a
succession
of
rain
and
baffling
winds
for
six
or
seven
days
during
which
i
had
no
opportunity
of
hearing
the
remainder
of
the
boatswain
history
we
joined
the
fleet
off
toulon
closed
the
admiral
ship
and
the
captain
went
on
board
to
pay
his
respects
when
he
returned
we
found
out
through
the
first
lieutenant
that
we
were
to
remain
with
the
fleet
until
the
arrival
of
another
frigate
expected
in
about
a
fortnight
and
then
the
admiral
had
promised
that
we
should
have
a
cruise
the
second
day
after
we
had
joined
we
were
ordered
to
form
part
of
the
squadron
consisting
of
two
ships
and
four
frigates
the
french
fleet
used
to
come
out
and
manoeuvre
within
range
of
their
batteries
or
if
they
proceeded
further
from
the
shore
they
took
good
care
that
they
had
a
leading
wind
to
return
again
into
port
we
had
been
about
a
week
every
day
running
close
in
and
counting
the
french
fleet
in
the
harbour
to
see
that
they
were
all
safe
and
reporting
it
to
the
admiral
by
signal
when
one
fine
morning
the
whole
of
the
french
vessels
were
perceived
to
hoist
their
topsails
and
in
less
than
an
hour
they
were
under
weigh
and
came
out
of
the
harbour
we
were
always
prepared
for
action
night
and
day
and
indeed
often
exchanged
a
shot
or
two
with
the
batteries
when
we
reconnoitred
the
squadron
could
not
of
course
cope
with
the
whole
french
fleet
and
our
own
was
about
twelve
miles
in
the
offing
but
the
captain
of
the
ship
who
commanded
us
as
if
in
defiance
hoping
to
entice
them
further
out
this
was
not
very
easy
to
do
as
the
french
knew
that
a
shift
of
wind
might
put
it
out
of
their
power
to
refuse
an
action
which
was
what
they
would
avoid
and
what
we
were
so
anxious
to
bring
about
i
say
we
speaking
of
the
english
not
of
myself
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
not
so
very
anxious
i
was
not
exactly
afraid
but
i
had
an
unpleasant
sensation
at
the
noise
of
a
which
i
had
not
as
yet
got
over
however
four
of
the
french
frigates
made
sail
towards
us
and
when
within
four
miles
three
or
four
ships
following
them
as
if
to
support
them
our
captain
made
signal
for
permission
to
close
the
enemy
which
was
granted
with
our
pennants
and
those
of
another
frigate
we
immediately
made
all
sail
beat
to
quarters
put
out
the
fires
and
opened
the
magazines
the
french
ships
perceiving
that
only
two
of
our
frigates
were
sent
against
their
four
at
about
the
same
distance
from
their
frigates
as
our
ships
and
other
frigates
were
from
us
in
the
meantime
our
main
fleet
continued
to
work
in
shore
under
a
press
of
sail
and
the
french
main
fleet
also
gradually
approached
the
detached
ships
the
whole
scene
reminded
me
of
the
tournaments
i
had
read
of
it
was
a
challenge
in
the
lists
only
that
the
enemy
were
two
to
one
a
fair
acknowledgment
on
their
parts
of
our
superiority
in
about
an
hour
we
closed
so
near
that
the
french
frigates
made
sail
and
commenced
firing
we
reserved
our
fire
until
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
when
we
poured
our
broadside
into
the
headmost
frigate
exchanging
with
her
on
opposite
tacks
the
who
followed
also
gave
her
a
broadside
in
this
way
we
exchanged
broadsides
with
the
whole
four
and
we
had
the
best
of
it
for
they
could
not
load
so
fast
as
we
could
we
were
both
ready
again
for
the
frigates
as
they
passed
us
but
they
were
not
ready
with
their
broadside
for
the
who
followed
us
very
closely
so
that
they
had
two
broadsides
each
and
we
had
only
four
in
the
the
not
having
one
our
rigging
was
cut
up
a
great
deal
and
we
had
six
or
seven
men
wounded
but
none
killed
the
french
frigates
suffered
more
and
their
admiral
perceiving
that
they
were
cut
up
a
good
deal
made
a
signal
of
recall
in
the
meantime
we
had
both
tacked
and
were
ranging
up
on
the
weather
quarter
of
the
sternmost
frigate
the
ships
perceiving
this
ran
down
with
the
wind
two
points
free
to
support
their
frigates
and
our
squadron
made
all
sail
to
support
us
nearly
laying
up
for
where
we
were
but
the
wind
was
what
is
called
at
sea
a
soldier
wind
that
is
blowing
so
that
the
ships
could
lie
either
way
so
as
to
run
out
or
into
the
harbour
and
the
french
frigates
in
obedience
to
their
orders
made
sail
for
their
fleet
the
ships
coming
out
to
support
them
but
our
captain
would
not
give
it
up
although
we
all
continued
to
near
the
french
ships
every
minute
we
ran
in
with
the
frigates
exchanging
broadsides
with
them
as
fast
as
we
could
one
of
them
lost
her
foretopmast
and
dropped
astern
and
we
hoped
to
cut
her
off
but
the
others
shortened
sail
to
support
her
this
continued
for
about
twenty
minutes
when
the
french
ships
were
not
more
than
a
mile
from
us
and
our
own
commodore
had
made
the
signal
of
our
recall
for
he
thought
that
we
should
be
overpowered
and
taken
but
the
who
saw
the
recall
up
did
not
repeat
it
and
our
captain
was
determined
not
to
see
it
and
ordered
the
not
to
look
that
way
the
action
continued
two
of
the
french
frigates
were
cut
to
pieces
and
complete
wrecks
when
the
french
ships
commenced
firing
it
was
then
high
time
to
be
off
we
each
of
us
poured
in
another
broadside
and
then
wore
round
for
our
own
squadron
which
was
about
four
miles
off
and
rather
to
leeward
standing
in
to
our
assistance
as
we
wore
round
our
which
had
been
badly
wounded
fell
over
the
side
and
the
french
perceiving
this
made
all
sail
with
the
hope
of
capturing
us
but
the
remained
with
us
and
we
threw
up
in
the
wind
and
raked
them
until
they
were
within
two
cables
lengths
of
us
then
we
stood
on
for
our
own
ships
at
last
one
of
the
ships
which
sailed
as
well
as
the
frigates
came
abreast
of
us
and
poured
in
a
broadside
which
brought
everything
about
our
ears
and
i
thought
we
must
be
taken
but
on
the
contrary
although
we
lost
several
men
the
captain
said
to
the
first
lieutenant
now
if
they
only
wait
a
little
longer
they
are
nabbed
as
sure
as
fate
just
at
this
moment
our
own
ships
opened
their
fire
and
then
the
tables
were
turned
the
french
tacked
and
stood
in
as
fast
as
they
could
followed
by
the
squadron
with
the
exception
of
our
ship
which
was
too
much
crippled
to
chase
them
one
of
their
frigates
had
taken
in
tow
the
other
who
had
lost
her
and
our
squadron
came
up
with
her
very
fast
the
english
fleet
were
also
within
three
miles
standing
in
and
the
french
fleet
standing
out
to
the
assistance
of
the
other
ships
which
had
been
engaged
i
thought
and
so
did
everybody
that
there
would
be
a
general
action
but
we
were
disappointed
the
frigate
which
towed
the
other
finding
that
she
could
not
escape
cast
her
off
and
left
her
to
her
fate
which
was
to
haul
down
her
colours
to
the
commodore
of
the
squadron
the
chase
was
continued
until
the
whole
of
the
french
vessels
were
close
under
their
batteries
and
then
our
fleet
returned
to
its
station
with
the
prize
which
proved
to
be
the
of
guns
captain
le
pelleteon
our
captain
obtained
a
great
deal
of
credit
for
his
gallant
behaviour
we
had
three
men
killed
and
robinson
the
midshipman
and
ten
men
wounded
some
of
them
severely
i
think
this
action
cured
me
of
my
fear
of
a
for
during
the
few
days
we
remained
with
the
fleet
we
often
were
fired
at
when
we
reconnoitred
but
i
did
not
care
anything
for
them
about
the
time
she
was
expected
the
frigate
joined
and
we
had
permission
to
part
company
but
before
i
proceed
with
the
history
of
our
cruise
i
shall
mention
the
circumstances
attending
a
which
took
place
during
the
time
that
we
were
with
the
fleet
our
captain
having
been
recalled
from
the
squadron
to
sit
as
one
of
the
members
i
was
the
midshipman
appointed
to
the
captain
gig
and
remained
on
board
of
the
admiral
ship
during
the
whole
of
the
time
that
the
court
was
sitting
two
seamen
one
an
englishman
and
the
other
a
frenchman
were
tried
for
desertion
from
one
of
our
frigates
they
had
left
their
ship
about
three
months
when
the
frigate
captured
a
french
privateer
and
found
them
on
board
as
part
of
her
crew
for
the
englishman
of
course
there
was
no
defence
he
merited
the
punishment
of
death
to
which
he
was
immediately
sentenced
there
may
be
some
excuse
for
desertion
when
we
consider
that
the
seamen
are
taken
into
the
service
by
force
but
there
could
be
none
for
fighting
against
his
country
but
the
case
of
the
frenchman
was
different
he
was
born
and
bred
in
france
had
been
one
of
the
crew
of
the
french
gunboats
at
cadiz
where
he
had
been
made
a
prisoner
by
the
spaniards
and
expecting
his
throat
to
be
cut
every
day
had
contrived
to
escape
on
board
of
the
frigate
lying
in
the
harbour
and
entered
into
our
service
i
really
believe
to
save
his
life
he
was
nearly
two
years
in
the
frigate
before
he
could
find
an
opportunity
of
deserting
from
her
and
returning
to
france
when
he
joined
the
french
privateer
during
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
frigate
he
bore
an
excellent
character
the
greatest
point
against
him
was
that
on
his
arrival
at
gibraltar
he
had
been
offered
and
had
received
the
bounty
when
the
englishman
was
asked
what
he
had
to
say
in
his
defence
he
replied
that
he
had
been
pressed
out
of
an
american
ship
that
he
was
an
american
born
and
that
he
had
never
taken
the
bounty
but
this
was
not
true
the
defence
of
the
frenchman
was
considered
so
very
good
for
a
person
in
his
station
of
life
that
i
obtained
a
copy
of
it
which
ran
as
follows
mr
president
and
officers
of
the
honourable
court
it
is
with
the
greatest
humility
that
i
venture
to
address
you
i
shall
be
very
brief
nor
shall
i
attempt
to
disprove
the
charges
which
have
been
made
against
me
but
confine
myself
to
a
few
facts
the
consideration
of
which
will
i
trust
operate
upon
your
feelings
in
mitigation
of
the
punishment
to
which
i
may
be
sentenced
for
my
fault
a
fault
which
proceeded
not
from
any
evil
motive
but
from
an
ardent
love
for
my
country
i
am
by
birth
a
frenchman
my
life
has
been
spent
in
the
service
of
france
until
a
few
months
after
the
revolution
in
spain
when
i
together
with
those
who
composed
the
french
squadron
at
cadiz
was
made
a
prisoner
the
hardships
and
cruel
usage
which
i
endured
became
insupportable
i
effected
my
escape
and
after
wandering
about
the
town
for
two
or
three
days
in
hourly
expectation
of
being
assassinated
the
fate
of
too
many
of
my
unfortunate
countrymen
desperate
from
famine
and
perceiving
no
other
chance
of
escaping
from
the
town
i
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
offering
myself
as
a
volunteer
on
board
of
an
english
frigate
i
dared
not
as
i
ought
to
have
done
acknowledge
myself
to
have
been
a
prisoner
from
the
dread
of
being
delivered
up
to
the
spaniards
during
the
period
that
i
served
on
board
of
your
frigate
i
confidently
rely
upon
the
captain
and
the
officers
for
my
character
the
love
of
our
country
although
dormant
for
a
time
will
ultimately
be
roused
and
peculiar
circumstances
occurred
which
rendered
the
feeling
irresistible
i
returned
to
my
duty
and
for
having
so
done
am
i
to
be
debarred
from
again
returning
to
that
country
so
dear
to
me
from
again
beholding
my
aged
parents
who
bless
me
in
my
absence
from
again
embracing
my
brothers
and
sisters
to
end
my
days
upon
a
scaffold
not
for
the
crime
which
i
did
commit
in
entering
into
your
service
but
for
an
act
of
duty
and
repentance
that
of
returning
to
my
own
allow
me
to
observe
that
the
charge
against
me
is
not
for
entering
your
service
but
for
having
deserted
from
it
for
the
former
not
even
my
misery
can
be
brought
forward
but
in
extenuation
for
the
latter
i
have
a
proud
consciousness
which
will
i
trust
be
my
support
in
my
extremity
gentlemen
i
earnestly
entreat
you
to
consider
my
situation
and
i
am
sure
that
your
generous
hearts
will
pity
me
let
that
love
of
your
country
which
now
animates
your
breasts
and
induces
you
to
risk
your
lives
and
your
all
now
plead
for
me
already
has
british
humanity
saved
thousands
of
my
countrymen
from
the
rage
of
the
spaniards
let
that
same
humanity
be
extended
now
and
induce
my
judges
to
add
one
more
to
the
list
of
those
who
although
our
nations
are
at
war
if
they
are
endowed
with
feeling
can
have
but
one
sentiment
towards
their
generous
enemy
a
sentiment
overpowering
all
other
that
of
a
gratitude
whatever
may
have
been
the
effect
of
the
address
upon
the
court
individually
it
appeared
at
the
time
to
have
none
upon
them
as
a
body
both
the
men
were
condemned
to
death
and
the
day
after
the
morrow
was
fixed
for
their
execution
i
watched
the
two
prisoners
as
they
went
down
the
side
to
be
conducted
on
board
of
their
own
ship
the
englishman
threw
himself
down
in
the
stern
sheets
of
the
boat
every
minor
consideration
apparently
swallowed
up
in
the
thought
of
his
approaching
end
but
the
frenchman
before
he
sat
down
observing
that
the
seat
was
a
little
dirty
took
out
his
silk
handkerchief
and
spread
it
on
the
seat
that
he
might
not
soil
his
nankeen
trowsers
i
was
ordered
to
attend
the
punishment
on
the
day
appointed
the
sun
shone
so
brightly
and
the
sky
was
so
clear
the
wind
so
gentle
and
mild
that
it
appeared
hardly
possible
that
it
was
to
be
a
day
of
such
awe
and
misery
to
the
two
poor
men
or
of
such
melancholy
to
the
fleet
in
general
i
pulled
up
my
boat
with
the
others
belonging
to
the
ships
of
the
fleet
in
obedience
to
the
orders
of
the
officer
superintending
close
to
the
of
the
ship
in
about
afterwards
the
prisoners
made
their
appearance
on
the
scaffold
the
caps
were
pulled
over
their
eyes
and
the
gun
fired
underneath
them
when
the
smoke
rolled
away
the
englishman
was
swinging
at
the
but
the
frenchman
was
not
he
had
made
a
spring
when
the
gun
fired
hoping
to
break
his
neck
at
once
and
put
an
end
to
his
misery
but
he
fell
on
the
edge
of
the
scaffold
where
he
lay
we
thought
that
his
rope
had
given
way
and
it
appeared
that
he
did
the
same
for
he
made
an
enquiry
but
they
returned
him
no
answer
he
was
kept
on
the
scaffold
during
the
whole
hour
that
the
englishman
remained
suspended
his
cap
had
been
removed
and
he
looked
occasionally
at
his
when
the
body
was
lowered
down
he
considered
that
his
time
was
come
and
attempted
to
leap
overboard
he
was
restrained
and
led
aft
where
his
reprieve
was
read
to
him
and
his
arms
were
unbound
but
the
effect
of
the
shock
was
too
much
for
his
mind
he
fell
down
in
a
swoon
and
when
he
recovered
his
senses
had
left
him
and
i
heard
that
he
never
recovered
them
but
was
sent
home
to
be
confined
as
a
maniac
i
thought
and
the
result
proved
that
it
was
carried
too
far
it
is
not
the
custom
when
a
man
is
reprieved
to
tell
him
so
until
after
he
is
on
the
scaffold
with
the
intention
that
his
awful
situation
at
the
time
may
make
a
lasting
impression
upon
him
during
the
remainder
of
his
life
but
as
a
foreigner
he
was
not
aware
of
our
customs
and
the
hour
of
intense
feeling
which
he
underwent
was
too
much
for
his
reason
i
must
say
that
this
circumstance
was
always
a
source
of
deep
regret
in
the
whole
fleet
and
that
his
being
a
frenchman
instead
of
an
englishman
increased
the
feeling
of
commiseration

me
but
to
make
use
of
their
expression
gave
me
her
eyes
and
sometimes
a
sweet
smile
i
recollect
i
was
so
busy
looking
at
her
one
day
that
i
tripped
over
my
sword
and
nearly
fell
on
my
nose
at
which
she
burst
out
a
laughing
your
sword
mr
chucks
i
thought
boatswains
never
wore
swords
mr
simple
a
boatswain
is
an
officer
and
is
entitled
to
a
sword
as
well
as
the
captain
although
we
have
been
laughed
out
of
it
by
a
set
of
midshipman
monkeys
i
always
wore
my
sword
at
that
time
but
a
boatswain
is
counted
as
nobody
unless
there
is
hard
work
to
do
and
then
it
mr
chucks
this
and
mr
chucks
that
but
i
explain
to
you
how
it
is
mr
simple
that
we
boatswains
have
lost
so
much
of
consequence
and
dignity
the
first
lieutenants
are
made
to
do
the
boatswain
duty
and
if
they
could
only
wind
the
call
they
might
scratch
the
boatswain
name
off
half
the
ships
books
in
his
majesty
service
but
to
go
on
with
my
yarn
on
the
fourth
day
i
called
with
my
handkerchief
full
of
segars
for
the
father
but
he
was
at
siesta
as
they
called
it
the
old
would
not
let
me
in
at
first
but
i
shoved
a
dollar
between
her
skinny
old
fingers
and
that
altered
her
note
she
put
her
old
head
out
and
looked
round
to
see
if
there
was
anybody
in
the
street
to
watch
us
and
then
she
let
me
in
and
shut
the
door
i
walked
into
the
room
and
found
myself
alone
with
seraphina
seraphina
what
a
fine
name
no
name
can
be
too
fine
for
a
pretty
girl
or
a
good
frigate
mr
simple
for
my
part
i
very
fond
of
these
hard
names
your
bess
and
poll
and
sue
do
very
well
for
the
point
or
castle
rag
but
in
my
opinion
they
degrade
a
lady
do
you
observe
mr
simple
that
all
our
a
sort
of
vessel
that
will
certainly
d
n
the
inventor
to
all
eternity
have
nothing
but
low
common
names
such
as
pincher
thrasher
boxer
badger
and
all
that
sort
which
are
quite
good
enough
for
them
whereas
all
our
dashing
saucy
frigates
have
names
as
long
as
the
bowling
and
hard
enough
to
break
your
jaw
such
as
melpomeny
terpsichory
arethusy
bacchanty
fine
flourishers
as
long
as
their
pennants
which
dip
alongside
in
a
calm
very
true
replied
i
but
do
you
think
then
it
is
the
same
with
family
names
most
certainly
mr
simple
when
i
was
in
good
society
i
rarely
fell
in
with
such
names
as
potts
or
bell
or
smith
or
hodges
it
was
always
mr
fortescue
or
mr
fitzgerald
or
mr
fitzherbert
seldom
bowed
sir
to
anything
under
syllables
then
i
presume
mr
chucks
you
are
not
fond
of
your
own
name
there
you
touch
me
mr
simple
but
it
is
quite
good
enough
for
a
boatswain
replied
mr
chucks
with
a
sigh
i
certainly
did
very
wrong
to
impose
upon
people
as
i
did
but
i
been
severely
punished
for
it
it
has
made
me
discontented
and
unhappy
ever
since
dearly
have
i
paid
for
my
spree
for
there
is
nothing
so
miserable
as
to
have
ideas
above
your
station
in
life
mr
simple
but
i
must
make
sail
again
i
was
three
hours
with
seraphina
before
her
father
came
home
and
during
that
time
i
never
was
quietly
at
an
anchor
for
above
a
minute
i
was
on
my
knees
vowing
and
swearing
kissing
her
feet
and
kissing
her
hand
till
at
last
i
got
to
her
lips
working
my
way
up
as
regularly
as
one
who
gets
in
at
the
hawsehole
and
crawls
aft
to
the
cabin
windows
she
was
very
kind
and
she
smiled
and
sighed
and
pushed
me
off
and
squeezed
my
hand
and
was
angry
frowning
till
i
was
in
despair
and
then
making
me
happy
again
with
her
melting
dark
eyes
beaming
kindly
till
at
last
she
said
that
she
would
try
to
love
me
and
asked
me
whether
i
would
marry
her
and
live
in
spain
i
replied
that
i
would
and
indeed
i
felt
as
if
i
could
only
at
the
time
the
thought
occurred
to
me
where
the
rhino
was
to
come
from
for
i
could
not
live
as
her
father
did
upon
a
paper
segar
and
a
piece
of
melon
per
day
at
all
events
as
far
as
words
went
it
was
a
settled
thing
when
her
father
came
home
the
old
servant
told
him
that
i
had
just
at
that
moment
arrived
and
that
his
daughter
was
in
her
own
room
so
she
was
for
she
ran
away
as
soon
as
she
heard
her
father
knock
i
made
my
bow
to
the
old
gentleman
and
gave
him
the
segars
he
was
serious
at
first
but
the
sight
of
them
put
him
into
good
humour
and
in
a
few
minutes
donna
seraphina
they
call
a
lady
a
donna
in
spain
came
in
saluting
me
ceremoniously
as
if
we
had
not
been
kissing
for
the
hour
together
i
did
not
remain
long
as
it
was
getting
late
so
i
took
a
glass
of
the
old
gentleman
sour
wine
and
walked
off
with
a
request
from
him
to
call
again
the
young
lady
paying
me
little
or
no
attention
during
the
time
that
i
remained
or
at
my
departure
well
mr
chucks
observed
i
it
appears
to
me
that
she
was
a
very
deceitful
young
person
so
she
was
mr
simple
but
a
man
in
love
ca
see
and
i
tell
you
why
if
he
wins
the
lady
he
is
as
much
in
love
with
himself
as
with
her
because
he
is
so
proud
of
his
conquest
that
was
my
case
if
i
had
had
my
eyes
i
might
have
seen
that
she
who
could
cheat
her
old
father
for
a
mere
stranger
would
certainly
deceive
him
in
his
turn
but
if
love
makes
a
man
blind
vanity
mr
simple
makes
him
blinder
in
short
i
was
an
ass
never
mind
mr
chucks
there
was
a
good
excuse
for
it
well
mr
simple
i
met
her
again
and
again
until
i
was
madly
in
love
and
the
father
appeared
to
be
aware
of
what
was
going
on
and
to
have
no
objection
however
he
sent
for
a
priest
to
talk
with
me
and
i
again
said
that
i
was
a
good
catholic
i
told
him
that
i
was
in
love
with
the
young
lady
and
would
marry
her
the
father
made
no
objection
on
my
promising
to
remain
in
spain
for
he
would
not
part
with
his
only
daughter
and
there
again
i
was
guilty
of
deceit
first
in
making
a
promise
i
did
not
intend
to
keep
and
then
in
pretending
that
i
was
a
catholic
honesty
is
the
best
policy
mr
simple
in
the
long
run
you
may
depend
upon
it
so
my
father
has
always
told
me
and
i
have
believed
him
replied
i
well
sir
i
am
ashamed
to
say
that
i
did
worse
for
the
priest
after
the
thing
was
settled
asked
me
whether
i
had
confessed
lately
i
knew
what
he
meant
and
answered
that
i
had
not
he
motioned
me
down
on
my
knees
but
as
i
could
not
speak
spanish
enough
for
that
i
something
or
another
half
spanish
and
half
english
and
ended
with
putting
four
dollars
in
his
hand
for
which
means
charity
he
was
satisfied
at
the
end
of
my
confession
whatever
he
might
have
been
at
the
beginning
and
gave
me
absolution
although
he
could
not
have
understood
what
my
crimes
were
but
four
dollars
mr
simple
will
pay
for
a
deal
of
crime
in
that
country
and
now
sir
comes
the
winding
up
of
this
business
seraphina
told
me
that
she
was
going
to
the
opera
with
some
of
her
relations
and
asked
me
if
i
would
be
there
that
the
captain
of
the
frigate
and
all
the
other
officers
were
going
and
that
she
wished
me
to
go
with
her
you
see
mr
simple
although
seraphina
father
was
so
poor
that
a
mouse
would
have
starved
in
his
house
still
he
was
of
good
family
and
connected
with
those
who
were
much
better
off
he
was
a
don
himself
and
had
fourteen
or
fifteen
long
names
which
i
forget
now
i
refused
to
go
with
her
as
i
knew
that
the
service
would
not
permit
a
boatswain
to
sit
in
an
when
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
were
there
i
told
her
that
i
had
promised
to
go
on
board
and
look
after
the
men
while
the
captain
went
on
shore
thus
as
you
see
mr
simple
making
myself
a
man
of
consequence
only
to
be
more
mortified
in
the
end
after
she
had
gone
to
the
opera
i
was
very
uncomfortable
i
was
afraid
that
the
captain
would
see
her
and
take
a
fancy
to
her
i
walked
up
and
down
outside
until
i
was
so
full
of
love
and
jealousy
that
i
determined
to
go
into
the
pit
and
see
what
she
was
about
i
soon
discovered
her
in
a
box
with
some
other
ladies
and
with
them
were
my
captain
and
first
lieutenant
the
captain
who
spoke
the
language
well
was
leaning
over
her
talking
and
laughing
and
she
was
smiling
at
what
he
said
i
resolved
to
leave
immediately
lest
she
should
see
me
and
discover
that
i
had
told
her
a
falsehood
but
they
appeared
so
intimate
that
i
became
so
jealous
i
could
not
quit
the
theatre
at
last
she
perceived
me
and
beckoned
her
hand
i
looked
very
angry
and
left
the
theatre
cursing
like
a
madman
it
appeared
that
she
pointed
me
out
to
the
captain
and
asked
him
who
i
was
he
told
her
my
real
situation
on
board
and
spoke
of
me
with
contempt
she
asked
whether
i
was
not
a
man
of
family
at
this
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
both
burst
out
laughing
and
said
that
i
was
a
common
sailor
who
had
been
promoted
to
a
higher
rank
for
good
behaviour
not
exactly
an
officer
and
anything
but
a
gentleman
in
short
mr
simple
i
was
and
although
the
captain
said
more
than
was
correct
as
i
learnt
afterwards
through
the
officers
still
i
deserved
it
determined
to
know
the
worst
i
remained
outside
till
the
opera
was
over
when
i
saw
her
come
out
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
walking
with
the
party
so
that
i
could
not
speak
with
her
i
walked
to
a
posada
that
an
inn
and
drank
seven
bottles
of
rosolio
to
keep
myself
quiet
then
i
went
on
board
and
the
second
lieutenant
who
was
commanding
officer
put
me
under
arrest
for
being
intoxicated
it
was
a
week
before
i
was
released
and
you
ca
imagine
what
i
suffered
mr
simple
at
last
i
obtained
leave
to
go
on
shore
and
i
went
to
the
house
to
decide
my
fate
the
old
woman
opened
the
door
and
then
calling
me
a
thief
slammed
it
in
my
face
as
i
retreated
donna
seraphina
came
to
the
window
and
waving
her
hand
with
a
contemptuous
look
said
and
god
be
with
you
mr
gentleman
i
returned
on
board
in
such
a
rage
that
if
i
could
have
persuaded
the
gunner
to
have
given
me
a
ball
cartridge
i
should
have
shot
myself
through
the
head
what
made
the
matter
worse
i
was
laughed
at
by
everybody
in
the
ship
for
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
had
made
the
story
public
well
mr
chucks
replied
i
i
can
not
help
being
sorry
for
you
although
you
certainly
deserved
to
be
punished
for
your
dishonesty
was
that
the
end
of
the
affair
as
far
as
i
was
concerned
it
was
mr
simple
but
not
as
respected
others
the
captain
took
my
place
but
without
the
knowledge
of
the
father
after
all
they
neither
had
great
reason
to
rejoice
at
the
exchange
how
so
mr
chucks
what
do
you
mean
why
mr
simple
the
captain
did
not
make
an
honest
woman
of
her
as
i
would
have
done
and
the
father
discovered
what
was
going
on
and
one
night
the
captain
was
brought
on
board
run
through
the
body
we
sailed
immediately
for
gibraltar
and
it
was
a
long
while
before
he
got
round
again
and
then
he
had
another
misfortune
what
was
that
why
he
lost
his
boatswain
mr
simple
for
i
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
him
and
then
he
lost
as
you
must
know
not
from
your
own
knowledge
but
from
that
of
others
a
boatswain
who
knows
his
duty
every
one
says
so
mr
chucks
i
sure
that
our
captain
would
be
very
sorry
to
part
with
you
i
trust
that
every
captain
has
been
with
whom
i
sailed
mr
simple
but
that
was
not
all
he
lost
mr
simple
for
the
next
cruise
he
lost
his
masts
and
the
loss
of
his
masts
occasioned
the
loss
of
his
ship
since
which
he
has
never
been
trusted
with
another
but
is
laid
on
the
shelf
now
he
never
carried
away
a
spar
of
any
consequence
during
the
whole
time
that
i
was
with
him
a
mast
itself
is
nothing
mr
simple
only
a
piece
of
wood
but
fit
your
rigging
properly
and
then
a
mast
is
strong
as
a
rock
only
ask
mr
faulkner
and
he
tell
you
the
same
and
i
never
met
an
officer
who
knew
better
how
to
support
a
mast
did
you
ever
hear
any
more
of
the
young
lady
yes
about
a
year
afterwards
i
returned
there
in
another
ship
she
had
been
shut
up
in
a
convent
and
forced
to
take
the
veil
oh
mr
simple
if
you
knew
how
i
loved
that
girl
i
have
never
been
more
than
polite
to
a
woman
since
and
shall
die
a
bachelor
you
ca
think
how
i
was
capsized
the
other
day
when
i
looked
at
the
house
i
have
hardly
touched
beef
or
pork
since
and
am
in
debt
two
quarts
of
rum
more
than
my
allowance
but
mr
simple
i
have
told
you
this
in
confidence
and
i
trust
you
are
too
much
of
a
gentleman
to
repeat
it
for
i
can
not
bear
quizzing
from
young
midshipmen
i
promised
that
i
would
not
mention
it
and
i
kept
my
word
but
circumstances
which
the
reader
will
learn
in
the
sequel
have
freed
me
from
the
condition
nobody
can
quiz
him
now
we
gained
our
station
off
the
coast
of
perpignan
and
as
soon
as
we
made
the
land
we
were
most
provokingly
driven
off
by
a
severe
gale
i
am
not
about
to
make
any
remarks
about
the
gale
for
one
storm
is
so
like
another
but
i
mention
it
to
account
for
a
conversation
which
took
place
and
with
which
i
was
very
much
amused
i
was
near
to
the
captain
when
he
sent
for
mr
muddle
the
carpenter
who
had
been
up
to
examine
the
yard
which
had
been
reported
as
sprung
well
mr
muddle
said
the
captain
sprung
sir
most
decidedly
but
i
think
we
be
able
to
it
will
you
be
able
to
secure
it
for
the
present
mr
muddle
replied
the
captain
rather
sharply
we
it
sir
in
half
an
hour
i
wish
that
you
would
use
common
phrases
when
you
speak
to
me
mr
muddle
i
presume
by
mitigate
you
mean
to
say
that
you
can
secure
it
do
you
mean
so
sir
or
do
you
not
yes
sir
that
is
what
i
mean
most
decidedly
i
hope
no
offence
captain
savage
but
i
did
not
intend
to
displease
you
by
my
language
very
good
mr
muddle
replied
the
captain
it
the
first
time
that
i
have
spoken
to
you
on
the
subject
recollect
that
it
will
be
the
last
the
first
time
replied
the
carpenter
who
could
not
forget
his
philosophy
i
beg
your
pardon
captain
savage
you
found
just
the
same
fault
with
me
on
this
years
ago
and
if
i
did
mr
muddle
interrupted
the
captain
very
angrily
depend
upon
it
that
at
the
same
time
i
ordered
you
to
go
aloft
and
attend
to
your
duty
instead
of
talking
nonsense
on
the
and
although
as
you
say
you
and
i
can
not
recollect
it
if
you
did
not
obey
that
order
instantaneously
i
also
put
you
in
confinement
and
obliged
you
to
leave
the
ship
as
soon
as
she
returned
to
port
do
you
understand
me
sir
i
rather
think
sir
replied
the
carpenter
humbly
touching
his
hat
and
walking
to
the
main
rigging
that
no
such
thing
took
place
for
i
went
up
immediately
as
i
do
now
and
continued
the
carpenter
who
was
incurable
as
he
ascended
the
rigging
as
i
shall
again
in
another
years
that
man
is
incorrigible
with
his
confounded
nonsense
observed
the
captain
to
the
first
lieutenant
every
mast
in
the
ship
would
go
over
the
side
provided
he
could
get
any
one
to
listen
to
his
ridiculous
theory
he
is
not
a
bad
carpenter
sir
replied
the
first
lieutenant
he
is
not
rejoined
the
captain
but
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
just
at
this
moment
the
boatswain
came
down
the
rigging
well
mr
chucks
what
do
you
think
of
the
yard
must
we
shift
it
inquired
the
captain
at
present
captain
savage
replied
the
boatswain
i
consider
it
to
be
in
a
state
which
may
be
called
precarious
and
not
at
all
permanent
but
with
a
little
human
exertion
four
fathom
of
and
tenpenny
nails
it
may
last
for
all
i
know
until
it
is
time
for
it
to
be
sprung
again
i
do
not
understand
you
mr
chucks
i
know
no
time
when
a
yard
ought
to
be
sprung
i
did
not
refer
to
our
time
sir
replied
the
boatswain
but
to
the
years
of
mr
muddle
when
go
forward
immediately
sir
and
attend
to
your
duty
cried
the
captain
in
a
very
angry
voice
and
then
he
said
to
the
first
lieutenant
i
believe
the
warrant
officers
are
going
mad
who
ever
heard
a
boatswain
use
such
language
and
not
at
all
permanent
his
stay
in
the
ship
will
become
so
if
he
does
not
mind
what
he
is
about
he
is
a
very
odd
character
sir
replied
the
first
lieutenant
but
i
have
no
hesitation
in
saying
that
he
is
the
best
boatswain
in
his
majesty
service
i
believe
so
too
replied
the
captain
but
well
every
one
has
his
faults
mr
simple
what
are
you
about
sir
i
was
listening
to
what
you
said
replied
i
touching
my
hat
i
admire
your
candour
sir
replied
he
but
advise
you
to
discontinue
the
practice
walk
over
to
leeward
sir
and
attend
to
your
duty
when
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
deck
i
looked
round
and
saw
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
both
laughing
chapter

i
go
away
on

am
wounded
and
taken
prisoner
with
diamond
cut

between
the
get
into
comfortable
quarters
my
first
interview
with
celeste
and
now
i
have
to
relate
an
event
which
young
as
i
was
at
the
time
will
be
found
to
have
seriously
affected
me
in
after
life
how
little
do
we
know
what
may
bring
forth
we
had
regained
our
station
and
for
some
days
had
been
standing
off
and
on
the
coast
when
one
morning
at
daybreak
we
found
ourselves
about
four
miles
from
the
town
of
cette
and
a
large
convoy
of
vessels
coming
round
a
point
we
made
all
sail
in
chase
and
they
anchored
close
in
shore
under
a
battery
which
we
did
not
discover
until
it
opened
fire
upon
us
the
shot
struck
the
frigate
two
or
three
times
for
the
water
was
smooth
and
the
battery
nearly
level
with
it
the
captain
tacked
the
ship
and
stood
out
again
until
the
boats
were
hoisted
out
and
all
ready
to
pull
on
shore
and
storm
the
battery
who
was
the
officer
commanding
the
first
cutter
on
service
was
in
his
boat
and
i
again
obtained
permission
from
him
to
smuggle
myself
into
it
now
peter
let
see
what
kind
of
a
fish
you
bring
on
board
this
time
said
he
after
we
had
shoved
off
or
may
be
the
fish
will
not
let
you
off
quite
so
easy
the
men
in
the
boat
all
laughed
at
this
and
i
replied
that
i
must
be
more
seriously
wounded
than
i
was
last
time
to
be
made
a
prisoner
we
ran
on
shore
amidst
the
fire
of
the
gunboats
who
protected
the
convoy
by
which
we
lost
three
men
and
made
for
the
battery
which
we
took
without
opposition
the
french
running
out
as
we
ran
in
the
directions
of
the
captain
were
very
positive
not
to
remain
in
the
battery
a
minute
after
it
was
taken
but
to
board
the
gunboats
leaving
only
one
of
the
small
boats
with
the
armourer
to
spike
the
guns
for
the
captain
was
aware
that
there
were
troops
stationed
along
the
coast
who
might
come
down
upon
us
and
beat
us
off
the
first
lieutenant
who
commanded
desired
to
remain
with
the
first
cutter
and
after
the
armourer
had
spiked
the
guns
as
officer
of
the
boat
he
was
to
shove
off
immediately
and
i
remained
in
the
battery
with
the
armourer
the
boat
crew
being
ordered
down
to
the
boat
to
keep
her
afloat
and
ready
to
shove
off
at
a
moment
warning
we
had
spiked
all
the
guns
but
one
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
volley
of
musketry
was
poured
upon
us
which
killed
the
armourer
and
wounded
me
in
the
leg
above
the
knee
i
fell
down
by
who
cried
out
by
the
powers
here
they
are
and
one
gun
not
spiked
he
jumped
down
wrenched
the
hammer
from
the
armourer
hand
and
seizing
a
nail
from
the
bag
in
a
few
moments
he
had
spiked
the
gun
at
this
time
i
heard
the
tramping
of
the
french
soldiers
advancing
when
threw
away
the
hammer
and
lifting
me
upon
his
shoulders
cried
come
along
peter
my
boy
and
made
for
the
boat
as
fast
as
he
could
but
he
was
too
late
he
had
not
got
half
way
to
the
boat
before
he
was
collared
by
two
french
soldiers
and
dragged
back
into
the
battery
the
french
troops
then
advanced
and
kept
up
a
smart
fire
our
cutter
escaped
and
joined
the
other
boat
who
had
captured
the
and
convoy
with
little
opposition
our
large
boats
had
carronades
mounted
in
their
bows
and
soon
returned
the
fire
with
round
and
grape
which
drove
the
french
troops
back
into
the
battery
where
they
remained
popping
at
our
men
under
cover
until
most
of
the
vessels
were
taken
out
those
which
they
could
not
man
were
burnt
in
the
meantime
had
been
taken
into
the
battery
with
me
on
his
back
but
as
soon
as
he
was
there
he
laid
me
gently
down
saying
peter
my
boy
as
long
as
you
were
under
my
charge
i
carry
you
through
thick
and
thin
but
now
that
you
are
under
the
charge
of
these
french
beggars
why
let
them
carry
you
every
man
his
own
bundle
peter
that
fair
play
so
if
they
think
you
worth
the
carrying
let
them
bear
the
weight
of
ye
and
suppose
they
do
not
will
you
leave
me
here
will
i
lave
you
peter
not
if
i
can
help
it
my
boy
but
they
leave
you
never
fear
them
prisoners
are
so
scarce
with
them
that
they
would
not
leave
the
captain
monkey
if
he
were
taken
as
soon
as
our
boats
were
clear
of
their
musketry
the
commanding
officer
of
the
french
troops
examined
the
guns
in
the
battery
with
the
hope
of
reaching
them
and
was
very
much
annoyed
to
find
that
every
one
of
them
was
spiked
he
look
sharper
than
a
magpie
before
he
finds
a
clear
i
expect
said
as
he
watched
the
officer
and
here
i
must
observe
that
showed
great
presence
of
mind
in
spiking
the
last
gun
for
had
they
had
one
gun
to
fire
at
our
boats
towing
out
the
prizes
they
must
have
done
a
great
deal
of
mischief
to
them
and
we
should
have
lost
a
great
many
men
but
in
so
doing
and
in
the
attempt
to
save
me
he
sacrificed
himself
and
was
taken
prisoner
when
the
troops
ceased
firing
the
commanding
officer
came
up
to
and
looking
at
him
said
officer
to
which
nodded
his
head
he
then
pointed
to
me
officer
nodded
his
head
again
at
which
the
french
troops
laughed
as
told
me
afterwards
because
i
was
what
they
called
an
which
means
an
infant
i
was
very
stiff
and
faint
and
could
not
walk
the
officer
who
commanded
the
troops
left
a
detachment
in
the
battery
and
prepared
to
return
to
cette
from
whence
they
came
walked
and
i
was
carried
on
three
muskets
by
six
of
the
french
soldiers
not
a
very
pleasant
conveyance
at
any
time
but
in
my
state
excessively
painful
however
i
must
say
that
they
were
very
kind
to
me
and
put
a
great
coat
or
something
under
my
wounded
leg
for
i
was
in
an
agony
and
fainted
several
times
at
last
they
brought
me
some
water
to
drink
o
how
delicious
it
was
i
have
often
thought
since
when
i
have
been
in
company
where
people
fond
of
good
living
have
smacked
their
lips
at
their
claret
that
if
they
could
only
be
wounded
and
taste
a
cup
of
water
they
would
then
know
what
it
was
to
feel
a
beverage
grateful
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
five
days
at
the
least
we
arrived
at
the
town
of
cette
and
i
was
taken
up
to
the
house
of
the
officer
who
commanded
the
troops
and
who
had
often
looked
at
me
as
i
was
carried
there
from
the
battery
saying
i
was
put
on
a
bed
where
i
again
fainted
away
when
i
came
to
my
senses
i
found
a
surgeon
had
bandaged
my
leg
and
that
i
had
been
undressed
was
standing
by
me
and
i
believe
that
he
had
been
crying
for
he
thought
that
i
was
dead
when
i
looked
him
in
the
face
he
said
pater
you
baste
how
you
frightened
me
bad
luck
to
me
if
ever
i
take
charge
of
another
youngster
what
did
you
sham
dead
for
i
am
better
now
replied
i
how
much
i
am
indebted
to
you
you
have
been
made
prisoner
in
trying
to
save
me
i
have
been
made
prisoner
in
doing
my
duty
in
one
shape
or
another
if
that
fool
of
an
armourer
had
held
his
hammer
so
tight
after
he
was
dead
and
it
was
of
no
use
to
him
i
should
have
been
clear
enough
and
so
would
you
have
been
but
however
all
this
is
nothing
at
all
peter
as
far
as
i
can
see
the
life
of
a
man
consists
in
getting
into
scrapes
and
getting
out
of
them
by
the
blessing
of
god
we
managed
the
first
and
by
the
blessing
of
god
we
manage
the
second
also
so
be
smart
my
honey
and
get
well
for
although
a
man
may
escape
by
running
away
on
two
legs
i
never
heard
of
a
boy
who
hopped
out
of
a
french
prison
upon
one
i
squeezed
the
offered
hand
of
and
looked
round
me
the
surgeon
stood
at
one
side
of
the
bed
and
the
officer
who
commanded
the
troops
at
the
other
at
the
head
of
the
bed
was
a
little
girl
about
twelve
years
old
who
held
a
cup
in
her
hand
out
of
which
something
had
been
poured
down
my
throat
i
looked
at
her
and
she
had
such
pity
in
her
face
which
was
remarkably
handsome
that
she
appeared
to
me
as
an
angel
and
i
turned
round
as
well
as
i
could
that
i
might
look
at
her
alone
she
offered
me
the
cup
which
i
should
have
refused
from
any
one
but
her
and
i
drank
a
little
another
person
then
came
into
the
room
and
a
conversation
took
place
in
french
i
wonder
what
they
mean
to
do
with
us
said
i
to
whist
hold
your
tongue
replied
he
and
then
he
leaned
over
me
and
said
in
a
whisper
i
understand
all
they
say
do
you
recollect
i
told
you
that
i
learnt
the
language
after
i
was
kilt
and
buried
in
the
sand
in
south
america
after
a
little
more
conversation
the
officer
and
the
others
retired
leaving
nobody
but
the
little
girl
and
in
the
room
it
a
message
from
the
governor
said
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
wishing
the
prisoners
to
be
sent
to
the
gaol
in
the
citadel
to
be
examined
and
the
officer
says
and
he
a
real
gentleman
as
far
as
i
can
judge
that
you
but
a
baby
and
badly
wounded
in
the
bargain
and
that
it
would
be
a
shame
not
to
leave
you
to
die
in
peace
so
i
presume
that
i
part
company
from
you
very
soon
i
hope
not
replied
i
if
you
go
to
prison
i
will
go
also
for
i
will
not
leave
you
who
are
my
best
friend
to
remain
with
strangers
i
should
not
be
half
so
happy
although
i
might
have
more
comforts
in
my
present
situation
pater
my
boy
i
am
glad
to
see
that
your
heart
is
in
the
right
place
as
i
always
thought
it
was
or
i
would
have
taken
you
under
my
protection
we
go
together
to
prison
my
jewel
and
i
fish
at
the
bars
with
a
bag
and
a
long
string
just
by
way
of
recreation
and
to
pick
up
a
little
money
to
buy
you
all
manner
of
nice
things
and
when
you
get
well
you
shall
do
it
yourself
mayhap
you
have
better
luck
as
peter
your
namesake
had
who
was
a
fisherman
before
you
twice
as
much
room
in
one
of
the
cells
as
there
is
in
a
berth
my
boy
and
the
prison
yards
where
you
are
allowed
to
walk
will
make
a
dozen
and
no
need
of
touching
your
hat
out
of
respect
when
you
go
into
it
when
a
man
has
been
cramped
up
on
board
of
a
where
midshipmen
are
stowed
away
like
pilchards
in
a
cask
he
finds
himself
quite
at
liberty
in
a
prison
peter
but
somehow
or
another
i
think
we
may
be
parted
yet
for
i
heard
the
officer
who
appears
to
be
a
real
gentleman
and
worthy
to
have
been
an
irishman
born
say
to
the
other
that
he
ask
the
governor
for
me
to
stay
with
you
on
parole
until
you
are
well
again
the
little
girl
handed
me
the
lemonade
of
which
i
drank
a
little
and
then
i
felt
very
faint
again
i
laid
my
head
on
the
pillow
and
having
left
off
talking
i
was
soon
in
a
comfortable
sleep
in
an
hour
i
was
awakened
by
the
return
of
the
officer
who
was
accompanied
by
the
surgeon
the
officer
addressed
in
french
who
shook
his
head
as
before
why
do
you
answer
said
i
since
you
understand
him
peter
recollect
that
i
can
not
speak
a
word
of
their
lingo
then
i
shall
know
what
they
say
before
us
and
they
wo
mind
what
they
say
supposing
i
do
not
understand
them
but
is
that
honest
is
it
honest
you
mean
if
i
had
a
note
in
my
pocket
and
do
choose
to
show
it
to
every
fellow
that
i
meet
is
that
dishonest
to
be
sure
it
not
and
that
what
the
lawyers
call
a
case
in
pint
well
replied
i
if
you
wish
it
i
shall
of
course
say
nothing
but
i
think
that
i
should
tell
them
especially
as
they
are
so
kind
to
us
during
this
conversation
the
officer
occasionally
spoke
to
the
surgeon
at
the
same
time
eyeing
us
i
thought
very
hard
two
other
persons
then
came
into
the
room
one
of
them
addressed
in
very
bad
english
saying
that
he
was
interpreter
and
would
beg
him
to
answer
a
few
questions
he
then
inquired
the
name
of
our
ship
number
of
guns
and
how
long
we
had
been
cruising
after
that
the
force
of
the
english
fleet
and
a
great
many
other
questions
relative
to
them
all
of
which
were
put
in
french
by
the
person
who
came
with
him
and
the
answer
translated
and
taken
down
in
a
book
some
of
the
questions
answered
correctly
to
others
he
pleaded
ignorance
and
to
some
he
asserted
what
was
not
true
but
i
did
not
blame
him
for
that
as
it
was
his
duty
not
to
give
information
to
the
enemy
at
last
they
asked
my
name
and
rank
which
told
them
was
i
noble
yes
replied
do
say
so
interrupted
i
peter
you
know
nothing
about
it
you
are
grandson
to
a
lord
i
know
that
but
still
i
am
not
noble
myself
although
descended
from
him
therefore
pray
do
say
so
bother
pater
i
have
said
it
and
i
wo
unsay
it
besides
pater
recollect
it
a
french
question
and
in
france
you
would
be
considered
noble
at
all
events
it
can
do
no
harm
i
feel
too
ill
to
talk
but
i
wish
you
had
not
said
so
they
then
inquired
name
which
he
told
them
his
rank
in
the
service
and
also
whether
he
was
noble
i
am
an
replied
he
and
pray
what
the
meaning
of
the
o
before
my
name
if
i
not
noble
however
mr
interpreter
you
may
add
that
we
have
dropped
our
title
because
it
not
convanient
the
french
officer
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
which
surprised
us
very
much
the
interpreter
had
great
difficulty
in
explaining
what
said
but
as
told
me
afterwards
the
answer
was
put
down
they
all
left
the
room
except
the
officer
who
then
to
our
astonishment
addressed
us
in
good
english
gentlemen
i
have
obtained
permission
from
the
governor
for
you
to
remain
in
my
house
until
mr
simple
is
recovered
mr
it
is
necessary
that
i
should
receive
your
parole
of
honour
that
you
will
not
attempt
to
escape
are
you
willing
to
give
it
was
quite
amazed
murder
an
irish
cried
he
so
you
speak
english
colonel
it
was
not
very
genteel
of
you
not
to
say
so
considering
how
we
been
talking
our
little
secrets
together
certainly
mr
not
more
necessary
replied
the
officer
smiling
than
for
you
to
tell
me
that
you
understood
french
o
bother
cried
how
nicely
i
caught
in
my
own
trap
you
an
irishman
sure
i
of
irish
descent
replied
the
officer
and
my
name
as
well
as
yours
is
i
was
brought
up
in
this
country
not
being
permitted
to
serve
my
own
and
retain
the
religion
of
my
forefathers
i
may
now
be
considered
as
a
frenchman
retaining
nothing
of
my
original
country
except
the
language
which
my
mother
taught
me
and
a
warm
feeling
towards
the
english
wherever
i
meet
them
but
to
the
question
mr
will
you
give
your
parole
the
word
of
an
irishman
and
the
hand
to
boot
replied
shaking
the
colonel
by
the
hand
and
you
more
than
doubly
sure
for
i
never
go
away
and
leave
little
peter
here
and
as
for
carrying
him
on
my
back
i
had
enough
of
that
already
it
is
sufficient
replied
the
colonel
mr
i
will
make
you
as
comfortable
as
i
can
and
when
you
are
tired
of
attending
your
friend
my
little
daughter
shall
take
your
place
you
find
her
a
kind
little
nurse
mr
simple
i
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
the
colonel
kindness
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
telling
that
dinner
was
ready
he
called
up
his
daughter
the
little
girl
who
had
attended
me
before
and
desired
her
to
remain
in
the
room
celeste
said
he
you
understand
a
little
english
quite
enough
to
find
out
what
he
is
in
want
of
go
and
fetch
your
work
to
amuse
yourself
when
he
is
asleep
celeste
went
out
and
returning
with
her
embroidery
sat
down
by
the
head
of
the
bed
the
colonel
and
then
quitted
the
room
celeste
then
commenced
her
embroidery
and
as
her
eyes
were
cast
down
upon
her
work
i
was
able
to
look
at
her
without
her
observing
it
as
i
said
before
she
was
a
very
beautiful
little
girl
her
hair
was
light
brown
eyes
very
large
and
eyebrows
drawn
as
with
a
pair
of
compasses
her
nose
and
mouth
were
also
very
pretty
but
it
was
not
so
much
her
features
as
the
expression
of
her
countenance
which
was
so
beautiful
so
modest
so
sweet
and
so
intelligent
when
she
smiled
which
she
almost
always
did
when
she
spoke
her
teeth
were
like
two
rows
of
little
pearls
i
had
not
looked
at
her
long
before
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
work
and
perceiving
that
i
was
looking
at
her
said
you
want
something
want
drink
i
speak
very
little
english
nothing
i
thank
ye
replied
i
i
only
want
to
go
to
sleep
then
shut
your
eye
replied
she
smiling
and
she
went
to
the
window
and
drew
down
the
blinds
to
darken
the
room
but
i
could
not
sleep
the
remembrance
of
what
had
occurred
in
a
few
hours
wounded
and
a
prisoner
the
thought
of
my
father
and
mother
anxiety
with
the
prospect
of
going
to
a
prison
and
close
confinement
as
soon
as
i
was
recovered
passed
in
succession
in
my
mind
and
together
with
the
actual
pain
of
my
wound
prevented
me
from
obtaining
any
rest
the
little
girl
several
times
opened
the
curtain
to
ascertain
whether
i
slept
or
wanted
anything
and
then
as
softly
retired
in
the
evening
the
surgeon
called
again
he
felt
my
pulse
and
directing
cold
applications
to
my
leg
which
had
swelled
considerably
and
was
becoming
very
painful
told
colonel
that
although
i
had
considerable
fever
i
was
doing
as
well
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
but
i
shall
not
dwell
upon
my
severe
sufferings
for
a
fortnight
after
which
the
ball
was
extracted
nor
upon
how
carefully
i
was
watched
by
the
colonel
and
little
celeste
during
my
peevishness
and
irritation
arising
from
pain
and
fever
i
feel
grateful
to
them
but
partiqularly
sic
to
celeste
who
seldom
quitted
me
for
more
than
and
as
i
gradually
recovered
tried
all
she
could
to
amuse
me
chapter
xix
we
remove
to
very
unpleasant
quarters
birds
of
a
feather
wo
always
flock
together
cuts
a
cutter
midshipman
and
gets
a
taste
of
french
steel
altogether
work
a
walk
into
the
interior
as
soon
as
i
was
well
enough
to
attend
to
my
little
nurse
we
became
very
intimate
as
might
be
expected
our
chief
employment
was
teaching
each
other
french
and
english
having
the
advantage
of
me
in
knowing
a
little
before
we
met
and
also
being
much
quicker
of
apprehension
she
very
soon
began
to
speak
english
fluently
long
before
i
could
make
out
a
short
sentence
in
french
however
as
it
was
our
chief
employment
and
both
were
anxious
to
communicate
with
each
other
i
learnt
it
very
fast
in
five
weeks
i
was
out
of
bed
and
could
limp
about
the
room
and
before
two
months
were
over
i
was
quite
recovered
the
colonel
however
would
not
report
me
to
the
governor
i
remained
on
a
sofa
during
the
day
but
at
dusk
i
stole
out
of
the
house
and
walked
about
with
celeste
i
never
passed
such
a
happy
time
as
the
last
fortnight
the
only
drawback
was
the
remembrance
that
i
should
soon
have
to
exchange
it
for
a
prison
i
was
more
easy
about
my
father
and
mother
as
had
written
to
them
assuring
them
that
i
was
doing
well
and
besides
a
few
days
after
our
capture
the
frigate
had
run
in
and
sent
a
flag
of
truce
to
inquire
if
we
were
alive
or
made
prisoners
at
the
same
time
captain
savage
sent
on
shore
all
our
clothes
and
two
hundred
dollars
in
cash
for
our
use
i
knew
that
even
if
letter
did
not
reach
them
they
were
sure
to
hear
from
captain
savage
that
i
was
doing
well
but
the
idea
of
parting
with
celeste
towards
whom
i
felt
such
gratitude
and
affection
was
most
painful
and
when
i
talked
about
it
poor
celeste
would
cry
so
much
that
i
could
not
help
joining
her
although
i
kissed
away
her
tears
at
the
end
of
twelve
weeks
the
surgeon
could
no
longer
withhold
his
report
and
we
were
ordered
to
be
ready
in
two
days
to
march
to
toulon
where
we
were
to
join
another
party
of
prisoners
to
proceed
with
them
into
the
interior
i
must
pass
over
our
parting
which
the
reader
may
imagine
was
very
painful
i
promised
to
write
to
celeste
and
she
promised
that
she
would
answer
my
letters
if
it
were
permitted
we
shook
hands
with
colonel
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
and
much
to
his
regret
we
were
taken
in
charge
by
two
french
cuirassiers
who
were
waiting
at
the
door
as
we
preferred
being
continued
on
parole
until
our
arrival
at
toulon
the
soldiers
were
not
at
all
particular
about
watching
us
and
we
set
off
on
horseback
and
i
going
first
and
the
french
cuirassiers
following
us
in
the
rear
we
trotted
or
walked
along
the
road
very
comfortably
the
weather
was
delightful
we
were
in
high
spirits
and
almost
forgot
that
we
were
prisoners
the
cuirassiers
followed
us
at
a
distance
of
twenty
yards
conversing
with
each
other
and
observed
that
it
was
amazingly
genteel
of
the
french
governor
to
provide
us
with
two
servants
in
such
handsome
liveries
the
evening
of
the
second
day
we
arrived
at
toulon
and
as
soon
as
we
entered
the
gates
we
were
delivered
into
the
custody
of
an
officer
with
a
very
sinister
cast
of
countenance
who
after
some
conversation
with
the
cuirassiers
told
us
in
a
surly
tone
that
our
parole
was
at
an
end
and
gave
us
in
charge
of
a
corporal
guard
with
directions
to
conduct
us
to
the
prison
near
the
arsenal
we
presented
the
cuirassiers
with
four
dollars
each
for
their
civility
and
were
then
hurried
away
to
our
place
of
captivity
i
observed
to
that
i
was
afraid
that
we
must
now
bid
farewell
to
anything
like
pleasure
you
right
there
peter
replied
he
but
there
a
certain
jewel
called
hope
that
somebody
found
at
the
bottom
of
his
chest
when
it
was
clean
empty
and
so
we
must
not
lose
sight
of
it
but
try
and
escape
as
soon
as
we
can
but
the
less
we
talk
about
it
the
better
in
a
few
minutes
we
arrived
at
our
destination
the
door
was
opened
ourselves
and
our
bundles
for
we
had
only
selected
a
few
things
for
our
march
the
colonel
promising
to
forward
the
remainder
as
soon
as
we
wrote
to
inform
him
to
which
depot
we
were
consigned
were
rudely
shoved
in
and
as
the
doors
again
closed
and
the
heavy
bolts
were
shot
i
felt
a
creeping
chilly
sensation
pass
through
my
whole
body
as
soon
as
we
could
see
for
although
the
prison
was
not
very
dark
yet
so
suddenly
thrown
in
after
the
glare
of
a
bright
sunshiny
day
at
first
we
could
distinguish
nothing
we
found
ourselves
in
company
with
about
thirty
english
sailors
most
of
them
were
sitting
down
on
the
pavement
or
on
boxes
or
bundles
containing
their
clothes
that
they
had
secured
conversing
with
each
other
or
playing
at
cards
or
draughts
our
entrance
appeared
to
excite
little
attention
after
having
raised
their
eyes
to
indulge
their
curiosity
they
continued
their
pursuits
i
have
often
thought
what
a
feeling
of
selfishness
appeared
to
pervade
the
whole
of
them
at
the
time
i
was
shocked
as
i
expected
immediate
sympathy
and
commiseration
but
afterwards
i
was
not
surprised
many
of
these
poor
fellows
had
been
months
in
the
prison
and
a
short
confinement
will
produce
that
indifference
to
the
misfortunes
of
others
which
i
then
observed
indeed
one
man
who
was
playing
at
cards
looked
up
for
a
moment
as
we
came
in
and
cried
out
hurrah
my
lads
the
more
the
merrier
as
if
he
really
was
pleased
to
find
that
there
were
others
who
were
as
unfortunate
as
himself
we
stood
looking
at
the
groups
for
about
ten
minutes
when
observed
that
we
might
as
well
come
to
an
anchor
foul
ground
being
better
than
no
bottom
so
we
sat
down
in
a
corner
upon
our
bundles
where
we
remained
for
more
than
an
hour
surveying
the
scene
without
speaking
a
word
to
each
other
i
could
not
speak
i
felt
so
very
miserable
i
thought
of
my
father
and
mother
in
england
of
my
captain
and
my
messmates
who
were
sailing
about
so
happily
in
the
frigate
of
the
kind
colonel
and
dear
little
celeste
and
the
tears
trickled
down
my
cheeks
as
these
scenes
of
former
happiness
passed
through
my
mind
in
quick
succession
did
not
speak
but
once
and
then
he
only
said
this
is
dull
work
peter
we
had
been
in
the
prison
about
two
hours
when
a
lad
in
a
very
greasy
ragged
jacket
with
a
pale
emaciated
face
came
up
to
us
and
said
i
perceive
by
your
uniforms
that
you
are
both
officers
as
well
as
myself
stared
at
him
for
a
little
while
and
then
answered
upon
my
soul
and
honour
then
you
the
advantage
of
us
for
it
more
than
i
could
perceive
in
you
but
i
take
your
word
for
it
pray
what
ship
may
have
had
the
misfortune
of
losing
such
a
credit
to
the
service
why
i
belonged
to
the
cutter
replied
the
young
lad
i
was
taken
in
a
prize
which
the
commanding
officer
had
given
in
my
charge
to
take
to
gibraltar
but
they
wo
believe
that
i
an
officer
i
have
applied
for
officer
allowance
and
rations
and
they
wo
give
them
to
me
well
but
they
know
that
we
are
officers
replied
why
do
they
shove
us
in
here
with
the
common
seamen
i
suppose
you
are
only
put
in
here
for
the
present
replied
the
cutter
midshipman
but
why
i
can
not
tell
nor
could
we
until
afterwards
when
we
found
out
as
our
narrative
will
show
that
the
officer
who
received
us
from
the
cuirassiers
had
once
quarrelled
with
colonel
who
first
pulled
his
nose
and
afterwards
ran
him
through
the
body
being
told
by
the
cuirassiers
that
we
were
much
esteemed
by
colonel
he
resolved
to
annoy
us
as
much
as
he
could
and
when
he
sent
up
the
document
announcing
our
arrival
he
left
out
the
word
officers
and
put
us
in
confinement
with
the
common
seamen
it
very
hard
upon
me
not
to
have
my
regular
allowance
as
an
officer
continued
the
midshipman
they
only
give
me
a
black
loaf
and
three
sous
a
day
if
i
had
had
my
best
uniform
on
they
never
would
have
disputed
my
being
an
officer
but
the
scoundrels
who
retook
the
prize
stole
all
my
traps
and
i
have
nothing
but
this
old
jacket
why
then
replied
you
know
the
value
of
dress
for
the
future
you
cutter
and
midshipmen
go
about
in
such
a
dirty
state
that
you
are
hardly
acknowledged
by
us
who
belong
to
frigates
to
be
officers
much
less
gentlemen
you
look
so
dirty
and
so
slovenly
when
we
pass
you
in
the
dockyard
that
we
give
you
a
wide
berth
how
then
can
you
suppose
strangers
to
believe
that
you
are
either
officers
or
gentlemen
upon
my
conscience
i
absolve
the
frenchmen
from
all
prejudice
for
as
to
your
being
an
officer
we
as
englishmen
have
nothing
but
your
bare
word
for
it
well
it
very
hard
replied
the
lad
to
be
attacked
this
way
by
a
brother
officer
your
coat
will
be
as
shabby
as
mine
before
you
have
been
here
long
that
very
true
my
darling
returned
but
at
least
i
shall
have
the
pleasant
reflection
that
i
came
in
as
a
gentleman
although
i
may
not
exactly
go
out
under
the
same
appearance
good
night
and
pleasant
dreams
to
you
i
thought
rather
cross
in
speaking
in
such
a
way
but
he
was
himself
always
as
remarkably
neat
and
well
dressed
as
he
was
handsome
and
well
made
fortunately
we
were
not
destined
to
remain
long
in
this
detestable
hole
after
a
night
of
misery
during
which
we
remained
sitting
on
our
bundles
and
sleeping
how
we
could
leaning
with
our
backs
against
the
damp
wall
we
were
roused
at
daybreak
by
the
unbarring
of
the
prison
doors
followed
up
with
an
order
to
go
into
the
prison
yard
we
were
huddled
out
like
a
flock
of
sheep
by
a
file
of
soldiers
with
loaded
muskets
and
as
we
went
into
the
yard
were
ranged
two
and
two
the
same
officer
who
ordered
us
into
prison
commanded
the
detachment
of
soldiers
who
had
us
in
charge
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
and
addressing
them
stated
that
we
were
officers
and
had
no
right
to
be
treated
like
common
sailors
the
french
officer
replied
that
he
had
better
information
and
that
we
wore
coats
which
did
not
belong
to
us
upon
which
was
in
a
great
rage
calling
the
officer
a
liar
and
demanding
satisfaction
for
the
insult
appealing
to
the
french
soldiers
and
stating
that
colonel
who
was
at
cette
was
his
countryman
and
had
received
him
for
two
months
into
his
house
upon
parole
which
was
quite
sufficient
to
establish
his
being
an
officer
the
french
soldiers
appeared
to
side
with
after
they
had
heard
this
explanation
stating
that
no
common
english
sailor
could
speak
such
good
french
and
that
they
were
present
when
we
were
sent
in
on
parole
and
they
asked
the
officer
whether
he
intended
to
give
satisfaction
the
officer
stormed
and
drawing
his
sword
out
of
the
scabbard
struck
with
the
flat
of
the
blade
looking
at
him
with
contempt
and
ordering
him
into
the
ranks
i
could
not
help
observing
that
during
this
scene
the
sailors
who
were
among
the
prisoners
were
very
indignant
while
on
the
contrary
those
captured
in
merchant
vessels
appeared
to
be
pleased
with
the
insult
offered
to
one
of
the
french
soldiers
then
made
a
sarcastic
remark
that
the
french
officer
did
not
much
like
the
name
of
this
so
enraged
the
officer
that
he
flew
at
pushed
him
back
into
the
ranks
and
taking
out
a
pistol
threatened
to
shoot
him
through
the
head
i
must
do
the
justice
to
the
french
soldiers
that
they
all
cried
out
shame
they
did
not
appear
to
have
the
same
discipline
or
the
same
respect
for
an
officer
as
the
soldiers
have
in
our
service
or
they
would
not
have
been
so
free
in
their
language
yet
at
the
same
time
they
obeyed
all
his
orders
on
service
very
implicitly
when
returned
to
the
ranks
he
looked
defiance
at
the
officer
telling
him
that
he
would
pocket
the
affront
very
carefully
as
he
intended
to
bring
it
out
again
upon
a
future
and
more
suitable
occasion
we
were
then
marched
out
in
ranks
two
and
two
being
met
at
the
street
by
two
drummers
and
a
crowd
of
people
who
had
gathered
to
witness
our
departure
the
drums
beat
and
away
we
went
the
officer
who
had
charge
of
us
mounted
a
small
horse
galloping
up
and
down
from
one
end
of
the
ranks
to
the
other
with
his
sword
drawn
bullying
swearing
and
striking
with
the
flat
of
the
blade
at
any
one
of
the
prisoners
who
was
not
in
his
proper
place
when
we
were
close
to
the
gates
we
were
joined
by
another
detachment
of
prisoners
we
were
then
ordered
to
halt
and
were
informed
through
an
interpreter
that
any
one
attempting
to
escape
would
immediately
be
shot
after
which
information
we
once
more
proceeded
on
our
route
nothing
remarkable
occurred
during
our
first
day
march
except
perhaps
a
curious
conversation
between
and
one
of
the
french
soldiers
in
which
they
disputed
about
the
comparative
bravery
of
the
two
nations
in
his
argument
told
the
frenchman
that
his
countrymen
could
not
stand
a
charge
of
english
bayonets
the
frenchman
replied
that
there
was
no
doubt
but
the
french
were
quite
as
brave
as
the
english
even
more
so
and
that
as
for
not
standing
the
charge
of
bayonets
it
was
not
because
they
were
less
brave
but
the
fact
was
that
they
were
most
excessively
we
had
black
bread
and
sour
wine
served
out
to
us
this
day
when
we
halted
to
refresh
persuaded
a
soldier
to
purchase
something
for
us
more
eatable
but
the
french
officer
heard
of
it
and
was
very
angry
ordering
the
soldier
to
the
rear
chapter
xx
fights
a
duel
with
a
french
officer
and
proves
that
the
great
art
of
fencing
is
knowing
nothing
about
it
we
arrive
at
our
new
quarters
which
we
find
very
secure
at
night
we
arrived
at
a
small
town
the
name
of
which
i
forget
here
we
were
all
put
into
an
old
church
for
the
night
and
a
very
bad
night
we
passed
they
did
not
even
give
us
a
little
straw
to
lie
down
upon
the
roof
of
the
church
had
partly
fallen
in
and
the
moon
shone
through
very
brightly
this
was
some
comfort
for
to
have
been
shut
up
in
the
dark
in
number
would
have
been
very
miserable
we
were
afraid
to
lie
down
anywhere
as
like
all
ruined
buildings
in
france
the
ground
was
covered
with
filth
and
the
smell
was
shocking
was
very
thoughtful
and
would
hardly
answer
any
question
that
i
put
to
him
it
was
evident
that
he
was
brooding
over
the
affront
which
he
had
received
from
the
french
officer
at
daybreak
the
door
of
the
church
was
again
opened
by
the
french
soldiers
and
we
were
conducted
to
the
square
of
the
town
where
we
found
the
troops
quartered
drawn
up
with
their
officers
to
receive
us
from
the
detachment
who
had
escorted
us
from
toulon
we
were
very
much
pleased
with
this
as
we
knew
that
we
should
be
forwarded
by
another
detachment
and
thus
be
rid
of
the
brutal
officer
who
had
hitherto
had
charge
of
the
prisoners
but
we
were
rid
of
him
in
another
way
as
the
french
officers
walked
along
our
ranks
to
look
at
us
i
perceived
among
them
a
captain
whom
we
had
known
very
intimately
when
we
were
living
at
cette
with
colonel
i
cried
out
his
name
immediately
he
turned
round
and
seeing
and
me
he
came
up
to
us
shaking
us
by
the
hand
and
expressing
his
surprise
at
finding
us
in
such
a
situation
explained
to
him
how
we
had
been
treated
at
which
he
expressed
his
indignation
as
did
the
other
officers
who
had
collected
round
us
the
major
who
commanded
the
troops
in
the
town
turned
to
the
french
officer
he
was
only
a
lieutenant
who
had
conducted
us
from
toulon
and
demanded
of
him
his
reason
for
behaving
to
us
in
such
an
unworthy
manner
he
denied
having
treated
us
ill
and
said
that
he
had
been
informed
that
we
had
put
on
dresses
which
did
not
belong
to
us
at
this
declared
that
he
was
a
liar
and
a
cowardly
that
he
had
struck
him
with
the
back
of
his
sabre
which
he
would
not
have
dared
do
if
he
had
not
been
a
prisoner
adding
that
all
he
requested
was
satisfaction
for
the
insult
offered
to
him
and
appealed
to
the
officers
whether
if
it
were
refused
the
lieutenant
epaulets
ought
not
to
be
cut
off
his
shoulders
the
major
commandant
and
the
officers
retired
to
consult
and
after
a
few
minutes
they
agreed
that
the
lieutenant
was
bound
to
give
the
satisfaction
required
the
lieutenant
replied
that
he
was
ready
but
at
the
same
time
did
not
appear
to
be
very
willing
the
prisoners
were
left
in
charge
of
the
soldiers
under
a
junior
officer
while
the
others
accompanied
by
myself
and
the
lieutenant
walked
to
a
short
distance
outside
the
town
as
we
proceeded
there
i
asked
with
what
weapons
they
would
fight
i
take
it
for
granted
replied
he
that
it
will
be
with
the
small
sword
but
said
i
do
you
know
anything
about
fencing
devil
a
bit
peter
but
that
all
in
my
favour
how
can
that
be
replied
i
i
tell
you
peter
if
one
man
fences
well
and
another
is
but
an
indifferent
hand
at
it
it
is
clear
that
the
first
will
run
the
other
through
the
body
but
if
the
other
knows
nothing
at
all
about
it
why
then
peter
the
case
is
not
quite
so
clear
because
the
good
fencer
is
almost
as
much
puzzled
by
your
ignorance
as
you
are
by
his
skill
and
you
become
on
more
equal
terms
now
peter
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
run
that
fellow
through
the
body
and
so
i
will
as
sure
as
i
am
an
well
i
hope
you
will
but
pray
do
not
be
too
sure
it
feeling
sure
that
will
make
me
able
to
do
it
peter
by
the
blood
of
the
did
he
slap
me
with
his
sword
as
if
i
were
a
clown
in
the
pantomime
peter
i
kill
the
harlequin
scoundrel
and
my
word
as
good
as
my
bond
by
this
time
we
had
arrived
at
the
ground
the
french
lieutenant
stripped
to
his
shirt
and
trousers
did
the
same
kicking
his
boots
off
and
standing
upon
the
wet
grass
in
his
stockings
the
swords
were
measured
and
handed
to
them
they
took
their
distance
and
set
to
i
must
say
that
i
was
breathless
with
anxiety
the
idea
of
losing
struck
me
with
grief
and
terror
i
then
felt
the
value
of
all
his
kindness
to
me
and
would
have
taken
his
place
and
have
been
run
through
the
body
rather
than
he
should
have
been
hurt
at
first
put
himself
in
the
correct
attitude
of
defence
in
imitation
of
the
lieutenant
but
this
was
for
a
very
few
seconds
he
suddenly
made
a
spring
and
rushed
on
to
his
adversary
stabbing
at
him
with
a
velocity
quite
astonishing
the
lieutenant
parrying
in
his
defence
until
at
last
he
had
an
opportunity
of
lungeing
at
who
no
longer
kept
his
left
arm
raised
in
equipoise
caught
the
sword
of
the
lieutenant
at
within
six
inches
of
the
point
and
directing
it
under
his
left
arm
as
he
rushed
in
passed
his
own
through
the
lieutenant
body
it
was
all
over
in
less
than
a
minute
the
lieutenant
did
not
live
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
french
officers
were
very
much
surprised
at
the
result
for
they
perceived
at
once
that
knew
nothing
of
fencing
gathered
a
tuft
of
grass
wiped
the
sword
which
he
presented
to
the
officer
to
whom
it
belonged
and
thanking
the
major
and
the
whole
of
them
for
their
impartiality
and
gentlemanlike
conduct
led
the
way
to
the
square
where
he
again
took
his
station
in
the
ranks
of
the
prisoners
shortly
after
the
major
commandant
came
up
to
us
and
asked
whether
we
would
accept
of
our
parole
as
in
that
case
we
might
travel
as
we
pleased
we
consented
with
many
thanks
for
his
civility
and
kindness
but
i
could
not
help
thinking
at
the
time
that
the
french
officers
were
a
little
mortified
at
success
although
they
were
too
honourable
to
express
the
feeling
told
me
after
we
had
quitted
the
town
that
had
it
not
been
for
the
handsome
conduct
of
the
officers
he
would
not
have
accepted
our
parole
as
he
felt
convinced
that
we
could
have
easily
made
our
escape
we
talked
over
the
matter
a
long
while
and
at
last
agreed
that
there
would
be
a
better
chance
of
success
by
and
by
when
more
closely
guarded
than
there
would
be
now
under
consideration
of
all
circumstances
as
it
required
previously
concerted
arrangements
to
get
out
of
the
country
i
had
almost
forgotten
to
say
that
on
our
return
after
the
duel
the
cutter
midshipman
called
out
to
requesting
him
to
state
to
the
commandant
that
he
was
also
an
officer
but
replied
that
there
was
no
evidence
for
it
but
his
bare
word
if
he
was
an
officer
he
must
prove
it
himself
as
everything
in
his
appearance
flatly
contradicted
his
assertion
it
very
hard
replied
the
midshipman
that
because
my
jacket
a
little
tarry
or
so
i
must
lose
my
rank
my
dear
fellow
replied
it
not
because
your
jacket
a
little
tarry
it
is
because
what
the
frenchmen
call
your
is
quite
disgraceful
in
an
officer
look
at
your
face
in
the
first
puddle
and
you
find
that
it
would
dirty
the
water
you
look
into
look
at
your
shoulders
above
your
ears
and
your
back
with
a
bow
like
a
in
a
cable
your
trowsers
sir
you
have
pulled
your
legs
too
far
through
showing
a
foot
and
a
half
of
worsted
stockings
in
short
look
at
yourself
altogether
and
then
tell
me
provided
you
be
an
officer
whether
from
respect
to
the
service
it
would
not
be
my
duty
to
contradict
it
it
goes
against
my
conscience
my
dear
fellow
but
recollect
that
when
we
arrive
at
the
depot
you
will
be
able
to
prove
it
so
it
only
waiting
a
little
while
until
the
captains
will
pass
their
word
for
you
which
is
more
than
i
will
well
it
very
hard
replied
the
midshipman
that
i
must
go
on
eating
this
black
rye
bread
and
very
unkind
of
you
it
very
kind
of
me
you
spalpeen
of
the
snapper
prison
will
be
a
paradise
to
you
when
you
get
into
good
commons
how
you
relish
your
grub
so
now
shut
your
pan
or
by
the
tail
of
jonah
whale
i
swear
you
a
spaniard
i
could
not
help
thinking
that
was
very
severe
upon
the
poor
lad
and
i
expostulated
with
him
afterwards
he
replied
peter
if
as
a
cutter
midshipman
he
is
a
bit
of
an
officer
the
devil
a
bit
is
he
of
a
gentleman
either
born
or
bred
and
i
not
bound
to
bail
every
chap
that
i
meet
by
the
head
of
st
peter
i
would
blush
to
be
seen
in
his
company
if
i
were
in
the
wildest
bog
in
ireland
with
nothing
but
an
old
crow
as
spectator
we
were
now
again
permitted
to
be
on
our
parole
and
received
every
attention
and
kindness
from
the
different
officers
who
commanded
the
detachments
which
passed
the
prisoners
from
one
town
to
another
in
a
few
days
we
arrived
at
montpelier
where
we
had
orders
to
remain
a
short
time
until
directions
were
received
from
government
as
to
the
depots
for
prisoners
to
which
we
were
to
be
sent
at
this
delightful
town
we
had
unlimited
parole
not
even
a
gendarme
accompanying
us
we
lived
at
the
table
were
permitted
to
walk
about
where
we
pleased
and
amused
ourselves
every
evening
at
the
theatre
during
our
stay
there
we
wrote
to
colonel
at
cette
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
and
narrating
what
had
occurred
since
we
parted
i
also
wrote
to
celeste
inclosing
my
letter
unsealed
in
the
one
to
colonel
i
told
her
the
history
of
duel
and
all
i
could
think
would
interest
her
how
sorry
i
was
to
have
parted
from
her
that
i
never
would
forget
her
and
trusted
that
some
day
as
she
was
only
half
a
frenchwoman
we
should
meet
again
before
we
left
montpelier
we
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
answers
to
our
letters
the
colonel
letters
were
very
kind
particularly
the
one
to
me
in
which
he
called
me
his
dear
boy
and
hoped
that
i
should
soon
rejoin
my
friends
and
prove
an
ornament
to
my
country
in
his
letter
to
he
requested
him
not
to
run
me
into
useless
danger
to
recollect
that
i
was
not
so
well
able
to
undergo
extreme
hardship
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
this
caution
referred
to
intention
to
escape
from
prison
which
he
had
not
concealed
from
the
colonel
and
the
probability
that
i
would
be
a
partner
in
the
attempt
the
answer
from
celeste
was
written
in
english
but
she
must
have
had
assistance
from
her
father
or
she
could
not
have
succeeded
so
well
it
was
like
herself
very
kind
and
affectionate
and
also
ended
with
wishing
me
a
speedy
return
to
my
friends
who
must
she
said
be
so
fond
of
me
that
she
despaired
of
ever
seeing
me
more
but
that
she
consoled
herself
as
well
as
she
could
with
the
assurance
that
i
should
be
happy
i
forgot
to
say
that
colonel
in
his
letter
to
me
stated
that
he
expected
immediate
orders
to
leave
cette
and
take
the
command
of
some
military
post
in
the
interior
or
join
the
army
but
which
he
could
not
tell
that
they
had
packed
up
everything
and
he
was
afraid
that
our
correspondence
must
cease
as
he
could
not
state
to
what
place
we
should
direct
our
letters
i
could
not
help
thinking
at
the
time
that
it
was
a
delicate
way
of
pointing
out
to
us
that
it
was
not
right
that
he
should
correspond
with
us
in
our
relative
situations
but
still
i
was
sure
that
he
was
about
to
leave
cette
for
he
never
would
have
made
use
of
a
subterfuge
i
must
here
acquaint
the
reader
with
a
circumstance
which
i
forgot
to
mention
which
was
that
when
captain
savage
sent
in
a
flag
of
truce
with
our
clothes
and
money
i
thought
that
it
was
but
justice
to
that
they
should
know
on
board
of
the
frigate
the
gallant
manner
in
which
he
had
behaved
i
knew
that
he
would
never
tell
himself
so
ill
as
i
was
at
the
time
i
sent
for
colonel
and
requested
him
to
write
down
my
statement
of
the
affair
in
which
i
mentioned
how
had
spiked
the
last
gun
and
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
so
doing
together
with
his
attempting
to
save
me
when
the
colonel
had
written
all
down
i
requested
that
he
would
send
for
the
major
who
first
entered
the
fort
with
the
troops
and
translate
it
to
him
in
french
this
he
did
in
my
presence
and
the
major
declared
every
word
to
be
true
will
he
attest
it
colonel
as
it
may
be
of
great
service
to
the
major
immediately
assented
colonel
then
enclosed
my
letter
with
a
short
note
from
himself
to
captain
savage
paying
him
a
compliment
and
assuring
him
that
his
gallant
young
officers
should
be
treated
with
every
attention
and
all
the
kindness
which
the
rules
of
war
would
admit
of
never
knew
that
i
had
sent
that
letter
as
the
colonel
at
my
request
kept
the
secret
in
ten
days
we
received
an
order
to
march
on
the
following
morning
the
sailors
among
whom
was
our
poor
friend
the
midshipman
of
the
snapper
cutter
were
ordered
to
verdun
and
i
with
eight
masters
of
merchant
vessels
who
joined
us
at
montpelier
were
directed
by
the
government
to
be
sent
to
givet
a
fortified
town
in
the
department
of
ardennes
but
at
the
same
time
orders
arrived
from
government
to
treat
the
prisoners
with
great
strictness
and
not
to
allow
any
parole
the
reason
of
this
we
were
informed
was
that
accounts
had
been
sent
to
government
of
the
death
of
the
french
officer
in
the
duel
with
and
they
had
expressed
their
dissatisfaction
at
its
having
been
permitted
indeed
i
very
much
doubt
whether
it
would
have
been
permitted
in
our
country
but
the
french
officers
are
almost
romantically
chivalrous
in
their
ideas
of
honour
in
fact
as
enemies
i
have
always
considered
them
as
worthy
antagonists
to
the
english
and
they
appear
more
respectable
in
themselves
and
more
demanding
our
goodwill
in
that
situation
than
they
do
when
we
meet
them
as
friends
and
are
acquainted
with
the
other
points
of
their
character
which
lessen
them
in
our
estimation
i
shall
not
dwell
upon
a
march
of
three
weeks
during
which
we
alternately
received
kind
or
unhandsome
treatment
according
to
the
dispositions
of
those
who
had
us
in
charge
but
i
must
observe
that
it
was
invariably
the
case
that
officers
who
were
gentlemen
by
birth
treated
us
with
consideration
while
those
who
had
sprung
from
nothing
during
the
revolution
were
harsh
and
sometimes
even
brutal
it
was
exactly
four
months
from
the
time
of
our
capture
that
we
arrived
at
our
destined
prison
at
givet
peter
said
as
he
looked
hastily
at
the
fortifications
and
the
river
which
divided
the
two
towns
i
see
no
reason
either
english
or
french
that
we
should
not
eat
our
christmas
dinner
in
england
a
bird
eye
view
of
the
outside
and
now
have
only
to
find
out
we
may
be
in
the
inside
i
must
say
that
when
i
looked
at
the
ditches
and
high
ramparts
i
had
a
different
opinion
so
had
a
gendarme
who
was
walking
by
our
side
and
who
had
observed
scrutiny
and
who
quietly
said
to
him
in
french
le
croyez
possible
everything
is
possible
to
a
brave
man
the
french
armies
have
proved
that
answered
you
are
right
replied
the
gendarme
pleased
with
the
compliment
to
his
nation
i
wish
you
success
you
will
deserve
it
but
and
he
shook
his
head
if
i
could
but
obtain
a
plan
of
the
fortress
said
i
would
give
five
napoleons
for
one
and
he
looked
at
the
gendarme
i
can
not
see
any
objection
to
an
officer
although
a
prisoner
studying
fortification
replied
the
gendarme
in
two
hours
you
will
be
within
the
walls
and
now
i
recollect
in
the
map
of
the
two
towns
the
fortress
is
laid
down
sufficiently
accurately
to
give
you
an
idea
of
it
but
we
have
conversed
too
long
so
saying
the
gendarme
dropped
into
the
rear
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
arrived
at
the
place
where
we
were
met
as
usual
by
another
detachment
of
troops
and
drummers
who
paraded
us
through
the
town
previous
to
our
being
drawn
up
before
the
governor
house
this
i
ought
to
have
observed
was
by
order
of
government
done
at
every
town
we
passed
through
it
was
very
contemptible
but
prisoners
were
so
scarce
that
they
made
all
the
display
of
us
that
they
could
as
we
stopped
at
the
governor
house
the
gendarme
who
had
left
us
in
the
square
made
a
sign
to
as
much
as
to
say
i
have
it
took
out
five
napoleons
which
he
wrapped
in
paper
and
held
in
his
hand
in
a
minute
or
two
the
gendarme
came
up
and
presented
with
an
old
silk
handkerchief
saying
mouchoir
replied
putting
the
handkerchief
which
contained
the
map
into
his
pocket
à
boire
mon
and
he
slipped
the
paper
with
the
five
napoleons
into
the
hand
of
the
gendarme
who
immediately
retreated
this
was
very
fortunate
for
us
as
we
afterwards
discovered
that
a
mark
had
been
put
against
and
my
name
not
to
allow
parole
or
permission
to
leave
the
fortress
even
under
surveillance
indeed
even
if
it
had
not
been
so
we
never
should
have
obtained
it
as
the
lieutenant
killed
by
was
nearly
related
to
the
commandant
of
the
fortress
who
was
as
much
a
as
his
kinsman
having
waited
the
usual
hour
before
the
governor
house
to
answer
to
our
and
to
be
stared
at
we
were
dismissed
and
in
a
few
minutes
found
ourselves
shut
up
in
one
of
the
strongest
fortresses
in
france
chapter
xxi
receives
his
commission
as
lieutenant
and
then
we
take
french
leave
of
givet
if
i
doubted
the
practicability
of
escape
when
i
examined
the
exterior
when
we
were
ushered
into
the
interior
of
the
fortress
i
felt
that
it
was
impossible
and
i
stated
my
opinion
to
we
were
conducted
into
a
yard
surrounded
by
a
high
wall
the
buildings
appropriated
for
the
prisoners
were
built
with
roofs
on
one
side
and
at
each
side
of
the
square
was
a
sentry
looking
down
upon
us
it
was
very
much
like
the
dens
which
they
now
build
for
bears
only
so
much
larger
answered
me
with
a
pish
peter
it
the
very
security
of
the
place
which
will
enable
us
to
get
out
of
it
but
do
talk
as
there
are
always
spies
about
who
understand
english
we
were
shown
into
a
room
allotted
to
six
of
us
our
baggage
was
examined
and
then
delivered
over
to
us
better
and
better
peter
observed
they
not
found
it
out
what
inquired
i
oh
only
a
little
selection
of
articles
which
might
be
useful
to
us
he
then
showed
me
what
i
never
before
was
aware
of
that
he
had
a
false
bottom
to
his
trunk
but
it
was
papered
over
like
the
rest
and
very
ingeniously
concealed
and
what
is
there
inquired
i
never
mind
i
had
them
made
at
montpelier
you
see
the
others
who
were
lodged
in
the
same
room
then
came
in
and
after
staying
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
away
at
the
sound
of
the
now
peter
said
i
must
get
rid
of
my
load
turn
the
key
then
undressed
himself
and
when
he
threw
off
his
shirt
and
drawers
showed
me
a
rope
of
silk
with
a
knot
at
every
two
feet
about
in
size
wound
round
and
round
his
body
there
were
about
sixty
feet
of
it
altogether
as
i
unwound
it
he
turning
round
and
round
observed
peter
i
worn
this
rope
ever
since
i
left
montpelier
and
you
no
idea
of
the
pain
i
have
suffered
but
we
must
go
to
england
that
decided
upon
when
i
looked
at
as
the
rope
was
wound
off
i
could
easily
imagine
that
he
had
really
been
in
great
pain
in
several
places
his
flesh
was
quite
raw
from
the
continual
friction
and
after
it
was
all
unwound
and
he
had
put
on
his
clothes
he
fainted
away
i
was
very
much
alarmed
but
i
recollected
to
put
the
rope
into
the
trunk
and
take
out
the
key
before
i
called
for
assistance
he
soon
came
to
and
on
being
asked
what
was
the
matter
said
that
he
was
subject
to
fits
from
his
infancy
he
looked
earnestly
at
me
and
i
showed
him
the
key
which
was
sufficient
for
some
days
who
really
was
not
very
well
kept
to
his
room
during
this
time
he
often
examined
the
map
given
him
by
the
gendarme
one
day
he
said
to
me
peter
can
you
swim
no
replied
i
but
never
mind
that
but
i
must
mind
it
peter
for
observe
we
shall
have
to
cross
the
river
meuse
and
boats
are
not
always
to
be
had
you
observe
that
this
fortress
is
washed
by
the
river
on
one
side
and
as
it
is
the
strongest
side
it
is
the
least
guarded
we
must
escape
by
it
i
can
see
my
way
clear
enough
till
we
get
to
the
second
rampart
on
the
river
but
when
we
drop
into
the
river
if
you
can
not
swim
i
must
contrive
to
hold
you
up
somehow
or
another
are
you
then
determined
to
escape
i
can
not
perceive
how
we
are
even
to
get
up
this
wall
with
four
sentries
staring
us
in
the
face
never
do
you
mind
that
peter
mind
your
own
business
and
first
tell
me
do
you
intend
to
try
your
luck
with
me
yes
replied
i
most
certainly
if
you
have
sufficient
confidence
in
me
to
take
me
as
your
companion
to
tell
you
the
truth
peter
i
would
not
give
a
farthing
to
escape
without
you
we
were
taken
together
and
please
god
we
take
ourselves
off
together
but
that
must
not
be
for
this
month
our
greatest
help
will
be
the
dark
nights
and
foul
weather
the
prison
was
by
all
accounts
very
different
from
verdun
and
some
others
we
had
no
parole
and
but
little
communication
with
the
townspeople
some
were
permitted
to
come
in
and
supply
us
with
various
articles
but
their
baskets
were
searched
to
see
that
they
contained
nothing
that
might
lead
to
an
escape
on
the
part
of
the
prisoners
without
the
precautions
that
had
taken
any
attempt
would
have
been
useless
still
as
soon
as
he
left
his
room
did
obtain
several
little
articles
especially
balls
of
twine
for
one
of
the
amusements
of
the
prisoners
was
flying
kites
this
however
was
put
a
stop
to
in
consequence
of
one
of
the
strings
whether
purposely
or
not
i
can
not
say
catching
the
lock
of
the
musket
carried
by
one
of
the
sentries
who
looked
down
upon
us
and
twitching
it
out
of
his
hand
after
which
an
order
was
given
by
the
commandant
for
no
kites
to
be
permitted
this
was
fortunate
for
us
as
by
degrees
purchased
all
the
twine
belonging
to
the
other
prisoners
and
as
we
were
more
than
three
hundred
in
number
it
amounted
to
sufficient
to
enable
him
by
stealth
to
lay
it
up
into
very
strong
cord
or
rather
into
a
sort
of
square
plait
known
only
to
sailors
now
peter
said
he
one
day
i
want
nothing
more
than
an
umbrella
for
you
why
an
umbrella
for
me
to
keep
you
from
being
drowned
with
too
much
water
that
all
rain
wo
drown
me
no
no
peter
but
buy
a
new
one
as
soon
as
you
can
i
did
so
boiled
up
a
quantity
of
bees
wax
and
oil
and
gave
it
several
coats
of
this
preparation
he
then
put
it
carefully
away
in
the
ticking
of
his
bed
i
asked
him
whether
he
intended
to
make
known
his
plan
to
any
of
the
other
prisoners
he
replied
in
the
negative
saying
that
there
were
so
many
of
them
who
could
not
be
trusted
that
he
would
trust
no
one
we
had
been
now
about
two
months
in
givet
when
a
steel
list
was
sent
to
a
lieutenant
who
was
confined
there
the
lieutenant
came
up
to
and
asked
him
his
christian
name
terence
to
be
sure
replied
then
answered
the
lieutenant
i
may
congratulate
you
on
your
promotion
for
here
you
are
upon
the
list
of
august
sure
there
must
be
some
trifling
mistake
let
me
look
at
it
terence
sure
enough
but
now
the
question
is
has
any
other
fellow
robbed
me
of
my
name
and
promotion
at
the
same
time
bother
what
can
it
mane
i
wo
belave
it
not
a
word
of
it
i
no
more
interest
than
a
dog
who
drags
really
observed
i
i
can
not
see
why
you
should
not
be
made
i
am
sure
you
deserve
your
promotion
for
your
conduct
when
you
were
taken
prisoner
and
what
did
i
do
then
you
simple
peter
but
put
you
on
my
back
as
the
men
do
their
hammocks
when
they
are
piped
down
but
barring
all
claim
how
could
any
one
know
what
took
place
in
the
battery
except
you
and
i
and
the
armourer
who
lay
dead
so
explain
that
peter
if
you
can
i
think
i
can
replied
i
after
the
lieutenant
had
left
us
and
i
then
told
how
i
had
written
to
captain
savage
and
had
had
the
fact
attested
by
the
major
who
had
made
us
prisoners
well
peter
said
after
a
pause
there
a
fable
about
a
lion
and
a
mouse
if
by
your
means
i
have
obtained
my
promotion
why
then
the
mouse
is
a
finer
baste
than
the
lion
but
instead
of
being
happy
i
shall
now
be
miserable
until
the
truth
is
ascertained
one
way
or
the
other
and
that
another
reason
why
i
must
set
off
to
england
as
fast
as
i
can
for
a
few
days
after
this
was
very
uneasy
but
fortunately
letters
arrived
by
that
time
one
to
me
from
my
father
in
which
he
requested
me
to
draw
for
whatever
money
i
might
require
saying
that
the
whole
family
would
retrench
in
every
way
to
give
me
all
the
comfort
which
might
be
obtained
in
my
unfortunate
situation
i
wept
at
his
kindness
and
more
than
ever
longed
to
throw
myself
in
his
arms
and
thank
him
he
also
told
me
that
my
uncle
william
was
dead
and
that
there
was
only
one
between
him
and
the
title
but
that
my
grandfather
was
in
good
health
and
had
been
very
kind
to
him
lately
my
mother
was
much
afflicted
at
my
having
been
made
a
prisoner
and
requested
i
would
write
as
often
as
i
could
letter
was
from
captain
savage
the
frigate
had
been
sent
home
with
despatches
and
conduct
represented
to
the
admiralty
which
had
in
consequence
promoted
him
to
the
rank
of
lieutenant
came
to
me
with
the
letter
his
countenance
radiant
with
joy
as
he
put
it
into
my
hands
in
return
i
put
mine
into
his
and
he
read
it
over
peter
my
boy
i
under
great
obligations
to
you
when
you
were
wounded
and
feverish
you
thought
of
me
at
a
time
when
you
had
quite
enough
to
think
of
yourself
but
i
never
thank
in
words
i
see
your
uncle
william
is
dead
how
many
more
uncles
have
you
my
uncle
john
who
is
married
and
has
already
two
daughters
blessings
on
him
may
he
stick
to
the
female
line
of
business
peter
my
boy
you
shall
be
a
lord
before
you
die
nonsense
i
have
no
chance
do
put
such
foolish
ideas
in
my
head
what
chance
had
i
of
being
a
lieutenant
and
am
i
not
one
well
peter
you
helped
to
make
a
lieutenant
of
me
but
i
make
a
of
you
and
that
better
peter
i
perceive
with
all
your
simplicity
that
you
not
over
and
above
simple
and
that
with
all
your
asking
for
advice
you
can
think
and
act
for
yourself
on
an
emergency
now
peter
these
are
talents
that
must
not
be
thrown
away
in
this
cursed
hole
and
therefore
my
boy
prepare
yourself
to
quit
this
place
in
a
week
wind
and
weather
permitting
that
is
to
say
not
fair
wind
and
weather
but
the
fouler
the
better
will
you
be
ready
at
any
hour
of
any
night
that
i
call
you
up
yes
i
will
and
do
my
best
no
man
can
do
much
more
that
ever
i
heard
of
but
peter
do
me
one
favour
as
i
am
really
a
lieutenant
just
touch
your
hat
to
me
only
once
that
all
but
i
wish
the
compliment
just
to
see
how
it
looks
lieutenant
said
i
touching
my
hat
have
you
any
further
orders
yes
sir
replied
he
that
you
never
presume
to
touch
your
hat
to
me
again
unless
we
sail
together
and
then
that
a
different
sort
of
thing
about
a
week
afterwards
came
to
me
and
said
the
new
quartered
in
with
foul
weather
if
it
holds
prepare
for
a
start
i
have
put
what
is
necessary
in
your
little
haversack
it
may
be
go
to
bed
now
and
sleep
for
a
week
if
you
can
for
you
get
but
little
sleep
if
we
succeed
for
the
week
to
come
this
was
about
eight
i
went
to
bed
and
about
twelve
i
was
roused
by
who
told
me
to
dress
myself
carefully
and
come
down
to
him
in
the
yard
i
did
so
without
disturbing
any
body
and
found
the
night
as
dark
as
pitch
it
was
then
november
and
raining
in
torrents
the
wind
was
high
howling
round
the
yard
and
sweeping
in
the
rain
in
every
direction
as
it
eddied
to
and
fro
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
find
who
was
hard
at
work
and
as
i
had
already
been
made
acquainted
with
all
his
plans
i
will
now
explain
them
at
montpelier
he
had
procured
six
large
pieces
of
iron
about
eighteen
inches
long
with
a
gimlet
at
one
end
of
each
and
a
square
at
the
other
which
fitted
to
a
handle
which
unshipped
for
precaution
he
had
a
spare
handle
but
each
handle
fitted
to
all
the
irons
had
screwed
one
of
these
pieces
of
iron
between
the
interstices
of
the
stones
of
which
the
wall
was
built
and
sitting
astride
on
that
was
fixing
another
about
three
feet
above
when
he
had
accomplished
this
he
stood
upon
the
lower
iron
and
supporting
himself
by
the
second
which
about
met
his
hip
he
screwed
in
a
third
always
fixing
them
about
six
inches
on
one
side
of
the
other
and
not
one
above
the
other
when
he
had
screwed
in
his
six
irons
he
was
about
half
up
the
wall
and
then
he
fastened
his
rope
which
he
had
carried
round
his
neck
to
the
upper
iron
and
lowering
himself
down
unscrewed
the
four
lower
irons
then
ascending
by
the
rope
he
stood
upon
the
fifth
iron
and
supporting
himself
by
the
upper
iron
recommenced
his
task
by
these
means
he
arrived
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
a
half
to
the
top
of
the
wall
where
he
fixed
his
last
iron
and
making
his
rope
fast
he
came
down
again
now
peter
said
he
there
is
no
fear
of
the
sentries
seeing
us
if
they
had
the
eyes
of
cats
they
could
not
until
we
were
on
the
top
of
the
wall
but
then
we
arrive
at
the
glacis
and
we
must
creep
to
the
ramparts
on
our
bellies
i
am
going
up
with
all
the
materials
give
me
your
haversack
you
will
go
up
lighter
and
recollect
should
any
accident
happen
to
me
you
run
to
bed
again
if
on
the
contrary
i
pull
the
rope
up
and
down
three
or
four
times
you
may
sheer
up
it
as
fast
as
you
can
then
loaded
himself
with
the
other
rope
the
two
knapsacks
iron
crows
and
other
implements
he
had
procured
and
last
of
all
with
the
umbrella
peter
if
the
rope
bears
me
with
all
this
it
is
clear
it
will
bear
such
a
creature
as
you
are
therefore
do
be
afraid
so
whispering
he
commenced
his
ascent
in
about
three
minutes
he
was
up
and
the
rope
pulled
i
immediately
followed
him
and
found
the
rope
very
easy
to
climb
from
the
knots
at
every
two
feet
which
gave
me
a
hold
for
my
feet
and
i
was
up
in
as
short
a
time
as
he
was
he
caught
me
by
the
collar
putting
his
wet
hand
on
my
mouth
and
i
lay
down
beside
him
while
he
pulled
up
the
rope
we
then
crawled
on
our
stomachs
across
the
glacis
till
we
arrived
at
the
rampart
the
wind
blew
tremendously
and
the
rain
pattered
down
so
fast
that
the
sentries
did
not
perceive
us
indeed
it
was
no
fault
of
theirs
for
it
was
impossible
to
have
made
us
out
it
was
some
time
before
could
find
out
the
point
exactly
above
the
drawbridge
of
the
first
ditch
at
last
he
did
he
fixed
his
in
and
lowered
down
the
rope
now
peter
i
had
better
go
first
again
when
i
shake
the
rope
from
below
all
right
descended
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
rope
again
shook
i
followed
him
and
found
myself
received
in
his
arms
upon
the
meeting
of
the
drawbridge
but
the
drawbridge
itself
was
up
led
the
way
across
the
chains
and
i
followed
him
when
we
had
crossed
the
moat
we
found
a
barrier
gate
locked
this
puzzled
us
pulled
out
his
picklocks
to
pick
it
but
without
success
here
we
were
fast
we
must
undermine
the
gate
we
must
pull
up
the
pavement
until
we
can
creep
under
peter
you
are
a
fine
fellow
i
never
thought
of
that
we
worked
very
hard
until
the
hole
was
large
enough
using
the
which
was
left
and
a
little
wrench
which
had
with
him
by
these
means
we
got
under
the
gate
in
the
course
of
an
hour
or
more
this
gate
led
to
the
lower
rampart
but
we
had
a
covered
way
to
pass
through
before
we
arrived
at
it
we
proceeded
very
cautiously
when
we
heard
a
noise
we
stopped
and
found
that
it
was
a
sentry
who
was
fast
asleep
and
snoring
little
expecting
to
find
one
here
we
were
puzzled
pass
him
we
could
not
well
as
he
was
stationed
on
the
very
spot
where
we
required
to
place
our
to
descend
the
lower
rampart
into
the
river
thought
for
a
moment
peter
said
he
now
is
the
time
for
you
to
prove
yourself
a
man
he
is
fast
asleep
but
his
noise
must
be
stopped
i
will
stop
his
mouth
but
at
the
very
moment
that
i
do
so
you
must
throw
open
the
pan
of
his
musket
and
then
he
can
not
fire
it
i
will
do
fear
me
we
crept
cautiously
up
to
him
and
motioning
to
me
to
put
my
thumb
upon
the
pan
i
did
so
and
the
moment
that
put
his
hand
upon
the
soldier
mouth
i
threw
open
the
pan
the
fellow
struggled
and
snapped
his
lock
as
a
signal
but
of
course
without
discharging
his
musket
and
in
a
minute
he
was
not
only
gagged
but
bound
by
with
my
assistance
leaving
him
there
we
proceeded
to
the
rampart
and
fixing
the
again
descended
i
followed
him
and
found
him
in
the
river
hanging
on
to
the
rope
the
umbrella
was
opened
and
turned
upwards
the
preparation
made
it
resist
the
water
and
as
previously
explained
to
me
by
i
had
only
to
hold
on
at
arm
length
to
two
beckets
which
he
had
affixed
to
the
point
of
the
umbrella
which
was
under
water
to
the
same
part
had
a
which
taking
in
his
teeth
he
towed
me
down
with
the
stream
to
about
a
hundred
yards
clear
of
the
fortress
where
we
landed
was
so
exhausted
that
for
a
few
minutes
he
remained
quite
motionless
i
also
was
benumbed
with
the
cold
peter
said
he
thank
god
we
have
succeeded
so
far
now
must
we
push
on
as
far
as
we
can
for
we
shall
have
daylight
in
two
hours
took
out
his
flask
of
spirits
and
we
both
drank
a
half
tumbler
at
least
but
we
should
not
in
our
state
have
been
affected
with
a
bottle
we
now
walked
along
the
till
we
fell
in
with
a
small
craft
with
a
boat
towing
astern
swam
to
it
and
cutting
the
painter
without
getting
in
towed
it
on
shore
the
oars
were
fortunately
in
the
boat
i
got
in
we
shoved
off
and
rowed
away
down
the
stream
till
the
dawn
of
day
all
right
peter
now
we
land
this
is
the
forest
of
ardennes
we
landed
replaced
the
oars
in
the
boat
and
pushed
her
off
into
the
stream
to
induce
people
to
suppose
that
she
had
broken
adrift
and
then
hastened
into
the
thickest
of
the
wood
it
still
rained
hard
i
shivered
and
my
teeth
chattered
with
the
cold
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
we
again
took
a
dram
of
spirits
and
worn
out
with
fatigue
and
excitement
soon
fell
fast
asleep
upon
a
bed
of
leaves
which
we
had
collected
together
chapter
xxii
grave
consequences
of
gravitation
enlists
himself
as
a
gendarme
and
takes
charge
of
me
we
are
discovered
and
obliged
to
run
for
it
the
pleasures
of
a
winter
bivouac
it
was
not
until
noon
that
i
awoke
when
i
found
that
had
covered
me
more
than
a
foot
deep
with
leaves
to
protect
me
from
the
weather
i
felt
quite
warm
and
comfortable
my
clothes
had
dried
on
me
but
without
giving
me
cold
how
very
kind
of
you
said
i
not
a
bit
peter
you
have
hard
work
to
go
through
yet
and
i
must
take
care
of
you
you
but
a
bud
and
i
a
rose
so
saying
he
put
the
to
his
mouth
and
then
handed
it
to
me
now
peter
we
must
make
a
start
for
depend
upon
it
they
will
scour
the
country
for
us
but
this
is
a
large
wood
and
they
may
as
well
attempt
to
find
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
if
we
once
get
into
the
heart
of
it
i
think
said
i
that
this
forest
is
mentioned
by
shakespeare
in
one
of
his
plays
very
likely
peter
replied
but
we
are
at
no
playwork
now
and
what
reads
amazing
prettily
is
no
joke
in
reality
i
often
observed
that
your
writers
never
take
the
weather
into
consideration
i
beg
your
pardon
in
king
lear
the
weather
was
tremendous
very
likely
but
who
was
the
king
that
went
out
in
such
weather
king
lear
did
when
he
was
mad
so
he
was
that
certain
peter
but
runaway
prisoners
have
some
excuse
so
now
for
a
start
we
set
off
forcing
our
way
through
the
thicket
for
about
three
hours
looking
occasionally
at
his
pocket
compass
it
then
was
again
nearly
dark
and
proposed
a
halt
we
made
up
a
bed
of
leaves
for
the
night
and
slept
much
more
comfortably
than
we
had
the
night
before
all
our
bread
was
wet
but
as
we
had
no
water
it
was
rather
a
relief
the
meat
we
had
with
us
was
sufficient
for
a
week
once
more
we
laid
down
and
fell
fast
asleep
about
five
in
the
morning
i
was
roused
by
who
at
the
same
time
put
his
hand
gently
over
my
mouth
i
sat
up
and
perceived
a
large
fire
not
far
from
us
the
philistines
are
upon
us
peter
said
he
i
have
reconnoitred
and
they
are
the
gendarmes
i
fearful
of
going
away
as
we
may
stumble
upon
some
more
of
them
i
been
thinking
what
best
before
i
waked
you
and
it
appears
to
me
that
we
had
better
get
up
the
tree
and
lie
there
at
that
time
we
were
hidden
in
a
copse
of
underwood
with
a
large
oak
in
the
centre
covered
with
ivy
i
think
so
too
shall
we
go
up
now
or
wait
a
little
now
to
be
sure
that
they
eating
their
prog
mount
you
peter
and
i
help
you
shoved
me
up
the
tree
and
then
waiting
a
little
while
to
bury
our
haversacks
among
the
leaves
he
followed
me
he
desired
me
to
remain
in
a
very
snug
position
on
the
first
fork
of
the
tree
while
he
took
another
amongst
a
bunch
of
ivy
on
the
largest
bough
there
we
remained
for
about
an
hour
when
day
dawned
we
observed
the
gendarmes
mustered
at
the
break
of
day
by
the
corporal
and
then
they
all
separated
in
different
directions
to
scour
the
wood
we
were
delighted
to
perceive
this
as
we
hoped
soon
to
be
able
to
get
away
but
there
was
one
gendarme
who
remained
he
walked
to
and
fro
looking
everywhere
until
he
came
directly
under
the
tree
in
which
we
were
concealed
he
poked
about
until
at
last
he
came
to
the
bed
of
leaves
upon
which
we
had
slept
these
he
turned
over
and
over
with
his
bayonet
until
he
routed
out
our
haversacks
pardi
exclaimed
he
where
the
nest
and
eggs
are
the
birds
are
near
he
then
walked
round
the
tree
looking
up
into
every
part
but
we
were
well
concealed
and
he
did
not
discover
us
for
some
time
at
last
he
saw
me
and
ordered
me
to
come
down
i
paid
no
attention
to
him
as
i
had
no
signal
from
he
walked
round
a
little
farther
until
he
was
directly
under
the
branch
on
which
lay
taking
up
this
position
he
had
a
fairer
aim
at
me
and
levelled
his
musket
saying
ou
je
still
i
continued
immoveable
for
i
knew
not
what
to
do
i
shut
my
eyes
however
the
musket
shortly
afterwards
was
discharged
and
whether
from
fear
or
not
i
can
hardly
tell
i
lost
my
hold
of
a
sudden
and
down
i
came
i
was
stunned
with
the
fall
and
thought
that
i
must
have
been
wounded
and
was
very
much
surprised
when
instead
of
the
gendarme
came
up
to
me
and
asked
whether
i
was
hurt
i
answered
i
believed
not
and
got
upon
my
legs
when
i
found
the
gendarme
lying
on
the
ground
breathing
heavily
but
insensible
when
perceived
the
gendarme
level
his
musket
at
me
he
immediately
dropped
from
the
bough
right
upon
his
head
this
occasioned
the
musket
to
go
off
without
hitting
me
and
at
the
same
time
the
weight
of
body
from
such
a
height
killed
the
gendarme
for
he
expired
before
we
left
him
now
peter
said
this
is
the
most
fortunate
thing
in
the
world
and
will
take
us
half
through
the
country
but
we
have
no
time
to
lose
he
then
stripped
the
gendarme
who
still
breathed
heavily
and
dragging
him
to
our
bed
of
leaves
covered
him
up
threw
off
his
own
clothes
which
he
tied
in
a
bundle
and
gave
to
me
to
carry
and
put
on
those
of
the
gendarme
i
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
metamorphosis
and
asked
what
he
intended
sure
i
a
gendarme
bringing
with
me
a
prisoner
who
has
escaped
he
then
tied
my
hands
with
a
cord
shouldered
his
musket
and
off
we
set
we
now
quitted
the
wood
as
soon
as
we
could
for
said
that
he
had
no
fear
for
the
next
ten
days
and
so
it
proved
we
had
one
difficulty
which
was
that
we
were
going
the
wrong
way
but
that
was
obviated
by
travelling
mostly
at
night
when
no
questions
were
asked
except
at
the
cabarets
where
we
lodged
and
they
did
not
know
which
way
we
came
when
we
stopped
at
night
my
youth
excited
a
great
deal
of
commiseration
especially
from
the
females
and
in
one
instance
i
was
offered
assistance
to
escape
i
consented
to
it
but
at
the
same
time
informed
of
the
plan
proposed
kept
watch
i
dressed
myself
and
was
at
the
open
window
when
he
rushed
in
seizing
me
and
declaring
that
he
would
inform
the
government
of
the
conduct
of
the
parties
their
confusion
and
distress
were
very
great
they
offered
twenty
thirty
forty
napoleons
if
he
would
hush
it
up
for
they
were
aware
of
the
penalty
and
imprisonment
replied
that
he
would
not
accept
of
any
money
in
compromise
of
his
duty
that
after
he
had
given
me
into
the
charge
of
the
gendarme
of
the
next
post
his
business
was
at
an
end
and
he
must
return
to
flushing
where
he
was
stationed
i
have
a
sister
there
replied
the
hostess
who
keeps
an
inn
want
good
quarters
and
a
friendly
cup
do
not
denounce
us
and
give
you
a
letter
to
her
which
if
it
does
not
prove
of
service
you
can
then
return
and
give
the
information
consented
the
letter
was
delivered
and
read
to
him
in
which
the
sister
was
requested
by
the
love
she
bore
to
the
writer
to
do
all
she
could
for
the
bearer
who
had
the
power
of
making
the
whole
family
miserable
but
had
refused
so
to
do
pocketed
the
letter
filled
his
and
saluting
all
the
women
left
the
cabaret
dragging
me
after
him
with
a
cord
the
only
difference
as
observed
after
he
went
out
was
that
he
kissed
all
the
women
and
all
the
women
kissed
me
in
this
way
we
had
proceeded
by
charleroy
and
louvain
and
were
within
a
few
miles
of
malines
when
a
circumstance
occurred
which
embarrassed
us
not
a
little
we
were
following
our
route
avoiding
malines
which
was
a
fortified
town
and
at
the
time
were
in
a
narrow
lane
with
wide
ditches
full
of
water
on
each
side
at
the
turning
of
a
sharp
corner
we
met
the
gendarme
who
had
supplied
with
a
map
of
the
town
of
givet
good
morning
comrade
said
he
to
looking
earnestly
at
him
whom
have
we
here
a
young
englishman
whom
i
picked
up
close
by
escaped
from
prison
where
from
he
will
not
say
but
i
suspect
from
givet
there
are
two
who
have
escaped
from
givet
replied
he
how
they
escaped
no
one
can
imagine
but
continued
he
again
looking
at
les
braves
il
a
rien
that
is
true
replied
i
have
taken
one
the
other
can
not
be
far
off
you
had
better
look
for
him
i
should
like
to
find
him
replied
the
gendarme
for
you
know
that
to
retake
a
runaway
prisoner
is
certain
promotion
you
will
be
made
a
corporal
so
much
the
better
replied
mon
nay
i
merely
came
for
a
walk
and
will
return
with
you
to
malines
where
of
course
you
are
bound
we
shall
not
get
there
said
my
prisoner
is
too
much
fatigued
well
then
we
will
go
as
far
as
we
can
and
i
will
assist
you
perhaps
we
may
find
the
second
who
i
understand
obtained
a
map
of
the
fortress
by
some
means
or
other
we
at
once
perceived
that
we
were
discovered
he
afterwards
told
us
that
the
body
of
a
gendarme
had
been
found
in
the
wood
no
doubt
murdered
by
the
prisoners
and
that
the
body
was
stripped
naked
i
wonder
continued
he
whether
one
of
the
prisoners
put
on
his
clothes
and
passed
as
a
gendarme
peter
said
are
we
to
murder
this
man
or
not
i
should
say
not
pretend
to
trust
him
and
then
we
may
give
him
the
slip
this
was
said
during
the
time
that
the
gendarme
stopped
a
moment
behind
us
well
we
try
but
first
i
put
him
off
his
guard
when
the
gendarme
came
up
with
us
observed
that
the
english
prisoners
were
very
liberal
that
he
knew
that
a
hundred
napoleons
were
often
paid
for
assistance
and
he
thought
that
no
corporal
rank
was
equal
to
a
sum
that
would
in
france
make
a
man
happy
and
independent
for
life
very
true
replied
the
gendarme
and
let
me
only
look
upon
that
sum
and
i
will
guarantee
a
positive
safety
out
of
france
then
we
understand
each
other
replied
this
boy
will
give
two
hundred
one
half
shall
be
yours
if
you
will
assist
i
will
think
of
it
replied
the
gendarme
who
then
talked
about
indifferent
subjects
until
we
arrived
at
a
small
town
called
acarchot
where
we
proceeded
to
a
cabaret
the
usual
curiosity
passed
over
we
were
left
alone
telling
the
gendarme
that
he
would
expect
his
reply
that
night
or
morning
the
gendarme
said
morning
requesting
him
to
take
charge
of
me
he
called
the
woman
of
the
cabaret
to
show
him
a
room
she
showed
him
one
or
two
which
he
refused
as
not
sufficiently
safe
for
the
prisoner
the
woman
laughed
at
the
idea
observing
what
had
he
to
fear
from
a
like
me
yet
this
escaped
from
givet
replied
these
englishmen
are
devils
from
their
birth
the
last
room
showed
to
suited
him
and
he
chose
it
the
woman
not
presuming
to
contradict
a
gendarme
as
soon
as
they
came
down
again
ordered
me
to
bed
and
went
with
me
he
bolted
the
door
and
pulling
me
to
the
large
chimney
we
put
our
heads
up
and
whispered
that
our
conversation
should
not
be
heard
this
man
is
not
to
be
trusted
said
and
we
must
give
him
the
slip
i
know
my
way
out
of
the
inn
and
we
must
return
the
way
we
came
and
then
strike
off
in
another
direction
but
will
he
permit
us
not
if
he
can
help
it
but
i
shall
soon
find
out
his
manoeuvres
then
went
and
stopped
the
by
hanging
his
handkerchief
across
it
and
stripping
himself
of
his
gendarme
uniform
put
on
his
own
clothes
then
he
stuffed
the
blankets
and
pillow
into
the
dress
and
laid
it
down
on
the
outside
of
the
bed
as
if
it
were
a
man
sleeping
in
his
clothes
indeed
it
was
an
admirable
deception
he
laid
his
musket
by
the
side
of
the
image
and
then
did
the
same
to
my
bed
making
it
appear
as
if
there
was
a
person
asleep
in
it
of
my
size
and
putting
my
cap
on
the
pillow
now
peter
we
see
if
he
is
watching
us
he
will
wait
till
he
thinks
we
are
asleep
the
light
still
remained
in
the
room
and
about
an
hour
afterwards
we
heard
a
noise
of
one
treading
on
the
stairs
upon
which
as
agreed
we
crept
under
the
bed
the
latch
of
our
door
was
tried
and
finding
it
open
which
he
did
not
expect
the
gendarme
entered
and
looking
at
both
beds
went
away
now
said
i
after
the
gendarme
had
gone
ought
we
not
to
escape
i
been
thinking
of
it
peter
and
i
have
come
to
a
resolution
that
we
can
manage
it
better
he
is
certain
to
come
again
in
an
hour
or
two
it
is
only
eleven
now
i
play
him
a
trick
then
took
one
of
the
blankets
make
it
fast
to
the
window
which
he
left
wide
open
and
at
the
same
time
disarranged
the
images
he
had
made
up
so
as
to
let
the
gendarme
perceive
that
they
were
counterfeit
we
again
crept
under
the
bed
and
as
foretold
in
about
an
hour
more
the
gendarme
returned
our
lamp
was
still
burning
but
he
had
a
light
of
his
own
he
looked
at
the
beds
perceived
at
once
that
he
had
been
duped
went
to
the
open
window
and
then
exclaimed
dieu
ils
echappés
et
je
ne
suis
plus
caporal
f
tre
à
la
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
and
in
a
minute
afterwards
we
heard
him
open
the
street
door
and
go
away
that
will
do
peter
said
laughing
now
we
be
off
also
although
there
no
great
hurry
then
resumed
his
dress
of
a
gendarme
and
about
an
hour
afterwards
we
went
down
and
wishing
the
hostess
all
happiness
quitted
the
cabaret
returning
the
same
road
by
which
we
had
come
now
peter
said
we
in
a
bit
of
a
puzzle
this
dress
wo
do
any
more
still
there
a
respectability
about
it
which
will
not
allow
me
to
put
it
off
till
the
last
moment
we
walked
on
till
daylight
when
we
hid
ourselves
in
a
copse
of
trees
at
night
we
again
started
for
the
forest
of
ardennes
for
said
our
best
chance
was
to
return
until
they
supposed
that
we
had
had
time
to
effect
our
escape
but
we
never
reached
the
forest
for
on
the
next
day
a
violent
snowstorm
came
on
it
continued
without
intermission
for
four
days
during
which
we
suffered
much
our
money
was
not
exhausted
as
i
had
drawn
upon
my
father
for
which
with
the
disadvantageous
exchange
had
given
me
fifty
napoleons
occasionally
crept
into
a
cabaret
and
obtained
provisions
but
as
we
dared
not
be
seen
together
as
before
we
were
always
obliged
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
the
ground
being
covered
more
than
three
feet
with
snow
on
the
fifth
day
being
then
six
days
from
the
forest
of
ardennes
we
hid
ourselves
in
a
small
wood
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
road
i
remained
there
while
as
a
gendarme
went
to
obtain
provisions
as
usual
i
looked
out
for
the
best
shelter
during
his
absence
and
what
was
my
horror
at
falling
in
with
a
man
and
woman
who
lay
dead
in
the
snow
having
evidently
perished
from
the
weather
just
as
i
discovered
them
returned
and
i
told
him
he
went
with
me
to
view
the
bodies
they
were
dressed
in
a
strange
attire
ribands
pinned
upon
their
clothes
and
two
pairs
of
very
high
stilts
lying
by
their
sides
surveyed
them
and
then
said
peter
this
is
the
very
best
thing
that
could
have
happened
to
us
we
may
now
walk
through
france
without
soiling
our
feet
with
the
cursed
country
how
do
you
mean
i
mean
said
he
that
these
are
the
people
that
we
met
near
montpelier
who
come
from
the
landes
walking
about
on
their
stilts
for
the
amusement
of
others
to
obtain
money
in
their
own
country
they
are
obliged
to
walk
so
now
peter
it
appears
to
me
that
the
man
clothes
will
fit
me
and
the
girl
poor
creature
how
pretty
she
looks
cold
in
death
will
fit
you
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
practise
a
little
and
then
away
we
start
then
with
some
difficulty
pulled
off
the
man
jacket
and
trowsers
and
having
so
done
buried
him
in
the
snow
the
poor
girl
was
despoiled
of
her
gown
and
upper
petticoat
with
every
decency
and
also
buried
we
collected
the
clothes
and
stilts
and
removed
to
another
quarter
of
the
wood
where
we
found
a
spot
and
took
our
meal
as
we
did
not
travel
that
night
as
usual
we
had
to
prepare
our
own
bed
we
scraped
away
the
snow
and
made
ourselves
as
comfortable
as
we
could
without
a
fire
but
the
weather
was
dreadful
peter
said
i
melancholy
here
drink
plenty
and
he
handed
me
the
flask
of
spirits
which
had
never
been
empty
drink
more
peter
i
can
not
without
being
tipsy
never
mind
that
drink
more
see
how
these
two
poor
devils
lost
their
lives
by
falling
asleep
in
the
snow
peter
said
starting
up
you
sleep
here
follow
me
i
expostulated
in
vain
it
was
almost
dark
and
he
led
me
to
the
village
near
which
he
pitched
upon
a
hovel
a
sort
of
peter
here
is
shelter
lie
down
and
sleep
and
i
keep
the
watch
not
a
word
i
will
have
it
down
at
once
i
did
so
and
in
a
very
few
minutes
was
fast
asleep
for
i
was
worn
out
with
cold
and
fatigue
for
several
days
we
had
walked
all
night
and
the
rest
we
gained
by
day
was
trifling
oh
how
i
longed
for
a
warm
bed
with
four
or
five
blankets
just
as
the
day
broke
roused
me
he
had
stood
sentry
all
night
and
looked
very
haggard
you
are
ill
said
i
not
a
bit
but
i
emptied
the
and
that
a
bad
job
however
it
is
to
be
remedied
we
then
returned
to
the
wood
in
a
mizzling
rain
and
fog
for
the
weather
had
changed
and
the
frost
had
broken
up
the
thaw
was
even
worse
than
the
frost
and
we
felt
the
cold
more
again
insisted
upon
my
sleeping
in
the
but
this
time
i
positively
refused
without
he
would
also
sleep
there
pointing
out
to
him
that
we
ran
no
more
risk
and
perhaps
not
so
much
as
if
he
stayed
outside
finding
i
was
positive
he
at
last
consented
and
we
both
gained
it
unperceived
we
lay
down
but
i
did
not
go
to
sleep
for
some
time
i
was
so
anxious
to
see
fast
asleep
he
went
in
and
out
several
times
during
which
i
pretended
to
be
fast
asleep
at
last
it
rained
in
torrents
and
then
he
lay
down
again
and
in
a
few
minutes
overpowered
by
nature
he
fell
fast
asleep
snoring
so
loudly
that
i
was
afraid
some
one
would
hear
us
i
then
got
up
and
watched
occasionally
lying
down
and
slumbering
awhile
and
then
going
to
the
door
chapter
xxiii
exalted
with
our
success
we
march
through
france
without
touching
the
ground
i
become
feminine
we
are
voluntary
conscripts
at
i
called
who
jumped
up
in
a
great
hurry
sure
i
been
asleep
peter
yes
you
have
replied
i
and
i
thank
heaven
that
you
have
for
no
one
could
stand
such
fatigue
as
you
have
much
longer
and
if
you
fall
ill
what
would
become
of
me
this
was
touching
him
on
the
right
point
well
peter
since
there
no
harm
come
of
it
there
no
harm
done
i
had
sleep
enough
for
the
next
week
that
certain
we
returned
to
the
wood
the
snow
had
disappeared
and
the
rain
ceased
the
sun
shone
out
from
between
the
clouds
and
we
felt
warm
do
pass
so
near
that
way
said
we
shall
see
the
poor
creatures
now
that
the
snow
is
gone
peter
we
must
shift
our
quarters
for
i
have
been
to
every
cabaret
in
the
village
and
i
can
not
go
there
any
more
without
suspicion
although
i
am
a
gendarme
we
remained
there
till
the
evening
and
then
set
off
still
returning
towards
givet
about
an
hour
before
daylight
we
arrived
at
a
copse
of
trees
close
to
the
and
surrounded
by
a
ditch
not
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
a
village
it
appears
to
me
said
that
this
will
do
i
will
now
put
you
there
and
then
go
boldly
to
the
village
and
see
what
i
can
get
for
here
we
must
stay
at
least
a
week
we
walked
to
the
copse
and
the
ditch
being
rather
too
wide
for
me
to
leap
laid
the
four
stilts
together
so
as
to
form
a
bridge
over
which
i
contrived
to
walk
tossing
to
me
all
the
bundles
and
desiring
me
to
leave
the
stilts
as
a
bridge
for
him
on
his
return
he
set
off
to
the
village
with
his
musket
on
his
shoulder
he
was
away
two
hours
when
he
returned
with
a
large
supply
of
provisions
the
best
we
had
ever
had
french
saucissons
seasoned
with
garlic
which
i
thought
delightful
four
bottles
of
brandy
besides
his
flask
a
piece
of
hung
beef
and
six
loaves
of
bread
besides
half
a
baked
goose
and
part
of
a
large
pie
there
said
he
we
have
enough
for
a
good
week
and
look
here
peter
this
is
better
than
all
and
he
showed
me
two
large
excellent
replied
i
now
we
shall
be
comfortable
i
paid
honestly
for
all
but
these
rugs
observed
but
i
was
afraid
to
buy
them
so
i
stole
them
however
we
leave
them
here
for
those
they
belong
to
it
only
borrowing
after
all
we
now
prepared
a
very
comfortable
shelter
with
branches
which
we
wove
together
and
laying
the
leaves
in
the
sun
to
dry
soon
obtained
a
soft
bed
to
put
one
on
while
we
covered
ourselves
up
with
the
other
our
bridge
of
stilts
we
had
removed
so
that
we
felt
ourselves
quite
secure
from
surprise
that
evening
we
did
nothing
but
carouse
the
goose
the
pie
the
saucissons
as
big
as
my
arm
were
alternately
attacked
and
we
went
to
the
ditch
to
drink
water
and
then
ate
again
this
was
quite
happiness
to
what
we
had
suffered
especially
with
the
prospect
of
a
good
bed
at
dark
to
bed
we
went
and
slept
soundly
i
never
felt
more
refreshed
during
our
wanderings
at
daylight
got
up
now
peter
a
little
practice
before
breakfast
what
practice
do
you
mean
mean
why
on
the
stilts
i
expect
in
a
week
that
you
be
able
to
dance
a
gavotte
at
least
for
mind
me
peter
you
travel
out
of
france
upon
these
stilts
depend
upon
it
then
took
the
stilts
belonging
to
the
man
giving
me
those
of
the
woman
we
strapped
them
to
our
thighs
and
by
fixing
our
backs
to
a
tree
contrived
to
get
upright
upon
them
but
at
the
first
attempt
to
walk
fell
to
the
right
and
i
fell
to
the
left
fell
against
a
tree
but
i
fell
on
my
nose
and
made
it
bleed
very
much
however
we
laughed
and
got
up
again
and
although
we
had
several
falls
at
last
we
made
a
better
hand
of
them
we
then
had
some
difficulty
in
getting
down
again
but
we
found
out
how
by
again
resorting
to
a
tree
after
breakfast
we
strapped
them
on
again
and
practised
and
so
we
continued
to
do
for
the
whole
day
when
we
again
attacked
our
provisions
and
fell
asleep
under
our
this
continued
for
five
days
by
which
time
being
constantly
on
the
stilts
we
became
very
expert
and
although
i
could
not
dance
a
gavotte
for
i
did
not
know
what
that
was
i
could
hop
about
with
them
with
the
greatest
ease
one
day
more
practice
said
for
our
provisions
will
last
one
day
more
and
then
we
start
but
this
time
we
must
rehearse
in
costume
then
dressed
me
in
the
poor
girl
clothes
and
himself
in
the
man
they
fitted
very
well
and
the
last
day
we
practised
as
man
and
woman
peter
you
make
a
very
pretty
girl
said
now
do
you
allow
the
men
to
take
liberties
never
fear
replied
i
but
as
these
petticoats
are
not
very
warm
i
mean
to
cut
off
my
trowsers
up
to
my
knees
and
wear
them
underneath
that
all
right
said
for
you
may
have
a
tumble
and
then
they
may
find
out
that
you
not
a
lady
the
next
morning
we
made
use
of
our
stilts
to
cross
the
ditch
and
carrying
them
in
our
hands
we
boldly
set
off
on
the
high
road
to
malines
we
met
several
people
and
others
but
with
the
exception
of
some
remarks
upon
my
good
looks
we
passed
unnoticed
towards
the
evening
we
arrived
at
the
village
where
we
had
slept
in
the
outhouse
and
as
soon
as
we
entered
it
we
put
on
our
stilts
and
commenced
a
march
when
the
crowd
had
gathered
we
held
out
our
caps
and
receiving
nine
or
ten
sous
we
entered
a
cabaret
many
questions
were
asked
us
as
to
where
we
came
from
and
answered
telling
lies
innumerable
i
played
the
modest
girl
and
who
stated
i
was
his
sister
appeared
very
careful
and
jealous
of
any
attention
we
slept
well
and
the
next
morning
continued
our
route
to
malines
we
very
often
put
on
our
stilts
for
practice
on
the
road
which
detained
us
very
much
and
it
was
not
until
the
eighth
day
without
any
variety
or
any
interruption
that
we
arrived
at
malines
as
we
entered
the
barriers
we
put
on
our
stilts
and
marched
boldly
on
the
guard
at
the
gate
stopped
us
not
from
suspicion
but
to
amuse
themselves
and
i
was
forced
to
submit
to
several
kisses
from
their
garlic
lips
before
we
were
allowed
to
enter
the
town
we
again
mounted
on
our
stilts
for
the
guard
had
forced
us
to
dismount
or
they
could
not
have
kissed
me
every
now
and
then
imitating
a
dance
until
we
arrived
at
the
where
we
stopped
opposite
the
hotel
and
commenced
a
sort
of
waltz
which
we
had
practised
the
people
in
the
hotel
looked
out
of
the
window
to
see
our
exhibition
and
when
we
had
finished
i
went
up
to
the
windows
with
cap
to
collect
money
what
was
my
surprise
to
perceive
colonel
looking
full
in
my
face
and
staring
very
hard
at
me
what
was
my
greater
astonishment
at
seeing
celeste
who
immediately
recognised
me
and
ran
back
to
the
sofa
in
the
room
putting
her
hands
up
to
her
eyes
and
crying
out
lui
fortunately
was
close
to
me
or
i
should
have
fallen
but
he
supported
me
peter
ask
the
crowd
for
money
or
you
are
lost
i
did
so
and
collecting
some
pence
then
asked
him
what
i
should
do
go
back
to
the
window
you
can
then
judge
of
what
will
happen
i
returned
to
the
window
colonel
had
disappeared
but
celeste
was
there
as
if
waiting
for
me
i
held
out
the
cap
to
her
and
she
thrust
her
hand
into
it
the
cap
sank
with
the
weight
i
took
out
a
purse
which
i
kept
closed
in
my
hand
and
put
it
into
my
bosom
celeste
then
retired
from
the
window
and
when
she
had
gone
to
the
back
of
the
room
kissed
her
hand
to
me
and
went
out
at
the
door
i
remained
stupefied
for
a
moment
but
roused
me
and
we
quitted
the
taking
up
our
quarters
at
a
little
cabaret
on
examining
the
purse
i
found
fifty
napoleons
in
it
these
must
have
been
obtained
from
her
father
i
cried
over
them
with
delight
was
also
much
affected
at
the
kindness
of
the
colonel
he
a
real
every
inch
of
him
said
he
even
this
cursed
country
ca
spoil
the
breed
at
the
cabaret
where
we
stopped
we
were
informed
that
the
officer
who
was
at
the
hotel
had
been
appointed
to
the
command
of
the
strong
fort
of
and
was
proceeding
thither
we
must
not
chance
to
meet
him
again
if
possible
said
it
would
be
treading
too
close
upon
the
heels
of
his
duty
neither
will
it
do
to
appear
on
stilts
among
the
dikes
so
peter
we
just
jump
on
clear
of
this
town
and
then
we
trust
to
our
wits
we
walked
out
of
the
town
early
in
the
morning
after
had
made
purchases
of
some
of
the
clothes
usually
worn
by
the
peasantry
when
within
a
few
miles
of
st
nicholas
we
threw
away
our
stilts
and
the
clothes
which
we
had
on
and
dressed
ourselves
in
those
had
purchased
had
not
forgotten
to
provide
us
with
two
large
blankets
which
we
strapped
on
to
our
shoulders
as
the
soldiers
do
their
coats
but
what
are
we
to
pass
for
now
peter
i
will
settle
that
point
before
night
my
wits
are
working
but
i
like
to
trust
to
chance
for
a
stray
idea
or
so
we
must
walk
fast
or
we
shall
be
smothered
with
the
snow
it
was
bitter
cold
weather
and
the
snow
had
fallen
heavily
during
the
whole
day
but
although
nearly
dusk
there
was
a
bright
moon
ready
for
us
we
walked
very
fast
and
soon
observed
persons
ahead
of
us
let
us
overtake
them
we
may
obtain
some
information
as
we
came
up
with
them
one
of
them
they
were
both
lads
of
seventeen
to
eighteen
said
to
i
thought
we
were
the
last
but
i
was
mistaken
how
far
is
it
now
to
st
nicholas
how
should
i
know
replied
i
am
a
stranger
in
these
parts
as
well
as
yourself
from
what
part
of
france
do
you
come
demanded
the
other
his
teeth
chattering
with
the
cold
for
he
was
badly
clothed
and
with
little
defence
from
the
inclement
weather
from
montpelier
replied
and
i
from
toulouse
a
sad
change
comrade
from
olives
and
vines
to
such
a
climate
as
this
curse
the
conscription
i
intended
to
have
taken
a
little
wife
next
year
gave
me
a
push
as
if
to
say
here
something
that
will
do
and
then
continued
and
curse
the
conscription
i
say
too
for
i
had
just
married
and
now
my
wife
is
left
to
be
annoyed
by
the
attention
of
the
but
it
ca
be
helped
pour
la
france
et
pour
la
we
shall
be
too
late
to
get
a
billet
replied
the
other
and
not
a
sou
have
i
in
my
pocket
i
doubt
if
i
get
up
with
the
main
body
till
they
are
at
flushing
by
our
route
they
are
at
axel
if
we
arrive
at
st
nicholas
we
shall
do
well
replied
but
i
have
a
little
money
left
and
i
not
see
a
comrade
want
a
supper
or
a
bed
who
is
going
to
serve
his
country
you
can
repay
me
when
we
meet
at
flushing
that
i
will
with
thanks
replied
the
frenchman
and
so
will
jacques
here
if
you
will
trust
him
with
pleasure
replied
who
then
entered
into
a
long
conversation
by
which
he
drew
out
from
the
frenchmen
that
a
party
of
conscripts
had
been
ordered
to
flushing
and
that
they
had
dropped
behind
the
main
body
passed
himself
off
as
a
conscript
belonging
to
the
party
and
me
as
his
brother
who
had
resolved
to
join
the
army
as
a
drummer
rather
than
part
with
him
in
about
an
hour
we
arrived
at
st
nicholas
and
after
some
difficulty
obtained
entrance
into
a
cabaret
la
said
going
up
to
the
fire
and
throwing
the
snow
off
his
hat
in
a
short
time
we
were
seated
to
a
good
supper
and
very
tolerable
wine
the
hostess
sitting
down
by
us
and
listening
to
the
true
narratives
of
the
real
conscripts
and
the
false
one
of
after
supper
the
conscript
who
first
addressed
us
pulled
out
his
printed
paper
with
the
route
laid
down
and
observed
that
we
were
two
days
behind
the
others
read
it
over
and
laid
it
on
the
table
at
the
same
time
calling
for
more
wine
having
already
pushed
it
round
very
freely
we
did
not
drink
much
ourselves
but
plied
them
hard
and
at
last
the
conscript
commenced
the
whole
history
of
his
intended
marriage
and
his
disappointment
tearing
his
hair
and
crying
now
and
then
never
mind
interrupted
every
two
or
three
minutes
un
autre
coup
pour
la
and
thus
he
continued
to
make
them
both
drink
until
they
reeled
away
to
bed
forgetting
their
printed
paper
which
had
some
time
before
slipped
away
from
the
table
we
also
retired
to
our
room
when
observed
to
me
peter
this
description
is
as
much
like
me
as
i
am
to
old
nick
but
that
of
no
consequence
as
nobody
goes
willingly
as
a
conscript
and
therefore
they
will
never
have
a
doubt
but
that
it
is
all
right
we
must
be
off
early
while
these
good
people
are
in
bed
and
steal
a
long
march
upon
them
i
consider
that
we
are
now
safe
as
far
as
flushing
chapter
xxiv
what
occurred
at
flushing
and
what
occurred
when
we
got
out
of
flushing
an
hour
before
daybreak
we
started
the
snow
was
thick
on
the
ground
but
the
sky
was
clear
and
without
any
difficulty
or
interruption
we
passed
through
the
towns
of
axel
and
halst
arrived
at
terneuse
on
the
fourth
day
and
went
over
to
flushing
in
company
with
about
a
dozen
more
stragglers
from
the
main
body
as
we
landed
the
guard
asked
us
whether
we
were
conscripts
replied
that
he
was
and
held
out
his
paper
they
took
his
name
or
rather
that
of
the
person
it
belonged
to
down
in
a
book
and
told
him
that
he
must
apply
to
the
before
three
we
passed
on
delighted
with
our
success
and
then
pulled
out
the
letter
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
the
woman
of
the
cabaret
who
had
offered
to
assist
me
to
escape
when
passed
off
as
a
gendarme
and
reading
the
address
demanded
his
way
to
the
street
we
soon
found
out
the
house
and
entered
conscripts
said
the
woman
of
the
house
looking
at
i
am
billeted
full
already
it
must
be
a
mistake
where
is
your
order
read
said
handing
her
the
letter
she
read
the
letter
and
putting
it
into
her
neckerchief
desired
him
to
follow
her
beckoned
me
to
come
and
we
went
into
a
small
room
what
can
i
do
for
you
said
the
woman
i
will
do
all
in
my
power
but
alas
you
will
march
from
here
in
two
or
three
days
never
mind
replied
we
will
talk
the
matter
over
but
at
present
only
oblige
us
by
letting
us
remain
in
this
little
room
we
do
not
wish
to
be
seen
you
a
conscript
and
not
wish
to
be
seen
are
you
then
intending
to
desert
answer
me
one
question
you
have
read
that
letter
do
you
intend
to
act
up
to
its
purport
as
your
sister
requests
as
i
hope
for
mercy
i
will
if
i
suffer
everything
she
is
a
dear
sister
and
would
not
write
so
earnestly
if
she
had
not
strong
reason
my
house
and
everything
you
command
are
yours
can
i
say
more
but
continued
suppose
i
did
intend
to
desert
would
you
then
assist
me
at
my
peril
replied
the
woman
have
you
not
assisted
my
family
when
in
difficulty
well
then
i
will
not
at
present
detain
you
from
your
business

have
heard

several
times
let
us
have
dinner
when
convenient
and
we
will
remain
here
if
i
have
any
knowledge
of
phiz
d
call
observed
after
she
left
us
there
is
honesty
in
that
woman
and
i
must
trust
her
but
not
yet
we
must
wait
till
the
conscripts
have
gone

agreed
with
and
we
remained
talking
until
an
hour
afterwards
when
the
woman
brought
us
our
dinner

your
name
inquired
louise
eustache

might
have

letter

years
my
husband
is
seldom
at
home
he

of
a
soldier
who
is
this
lad
he
is
my
brother
who
if
i
go
as
a
soldier
intends
to
volunteer
as
a
drummer
enfant
the
cabaret
was
full
of
conscripts
and
other
people
so
that
the
hostess
had
enough
to
do
at
night
we
were
shown
by
her
into
a
small
adjoining
the
room
we
occupied
you
are
quite
alone
here
the
conscripts

to
muster

of
no
consequence

the
woman

any
one
to
assist
me
that
until
they
leave
the
town
i
can
hardly
find
time
to
speak
to
you
that
will
be
soon
enough
my
good
hostess
replied
the
next
evening
the
woman
came
in
in
some
alarm
stating
that
a
conscript
had
arrived
whose
name
had
been
given
in
before
and
that
the
person
who
had
given
it
in
had
not
mustered
at
the
place
that
the
conscript
had
declared
that
his
pass
had
been
stolen
from
him
by
a
person
with
whom
he
had
stopped
at
st
nicholas
and
that
there
were
orders
for
a
strict
search
to
be
made
through
the
town
as
it
was
known
that
some
english
officers
had
escaped
and
it
was
supposed
that
one
of
them
had
obtained
the
pass
surely
you
not
english
inquired
the
woman
looking
earnestly
at
indeed
but
i
am
my
dear
replied
and
so
is
this
lad
with
me
and
the
favour
which
your
sister
requires
is
that
you
help
us
over
the
water
for
which
service
there
are
one
hundred
louis
ready
to
be
paid
upon
delivery
of
us
mon
dieu
mais
impossible
replied
was
that
the
answer
i
gave
your
sister
in
her
trouble
moins
fort
that
quite
another
concern
but
with
your
husband
a
pilot
i
should
think
a
great
part
of
the
difficulty
removed
my
husband
i
no
power
over
him
replied
the
woman
putting
the
apron
up
to
her
eyes
but
one
hundred
louis
may
have
replied
there
is
truth
in
that
observed
the
woman
after
a
pause
but
what
am
i
to
do
if
they
come
to
search
the
house
send
us
out
of
it
until
you
can
find
an
opportunity
to
send
us
to
england
i
leave
it
all
to
you
your
sister
expects
it
from
you
and
she
shall
not
be
disappointed
if
god
helps
us
replied
the
woman
after
a
short
pause
but
i
fear
you
must
leave
this
house
and
the
town
also
how
are
we
to
leave
the
town
i
will
arrange
that
be
ready
at
four
for
the
gates
are
shut
at
dusk
i
must
go
now
for
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
we
are
in
a
nice
mess
now
observed
i
after
the
woman
had
quitted
the
room
devil
a
bit
peter
i
feel
no
anxiety
whatever
except
at
leaving
such
good
quarters
we
packed
up
all
our
effects
not
forgetting
our
two
blankets
and
waited
the
return
of
the
hostess
in
about
an
hour
she
entered
the
room
i
have
spoken
to
my
husband
sister
who
lives
about
two
miles
on
the
road
to
middelburg
she
is
in
town
now
for
it
is
and
you
will
be
safe
where
she
hides
you
i
told
her
it
was
by
my
request
or
she
would
not
have
consented
here
boy
put
on
these
clothes
i
will
assist
you
once
more
i
was
dressed
as
a
girl
and
when
my
clothes
were
on
burst
out
into
laughter
at
my
blue
stockings
and
short
petticoats
pas
observed
the
hostess
as
she
fixed
a
small
cap
on
my
head
and
then
tied
a
kerchief
under
my
chin
which
partly
hid
my
face
put
on
a
greatcoat
which
the
woman
handed
to
him
with
a
hat
now
follow
me
she
led
us
into
the
street
which
was
thronged
till
we
arrived
at
the
when
she
met
another
woman
who
joined
her
at
the
end
of
the
stood
a
small
horse
and
cart
into
which
the
strange
woman
and
i
mounted
while
by
the
directions
of
the
landlady
led
the
horse
through
the
crowd
until
we
arrived
at
the
barriers
when
she
wished
us
good
day
in
a
loud
voice
before
the
guard
the
guard
took
no
notice
of
us
and
we
passed
safely
through
and
found
ourselves
upon
a
road
as
straight
as
an
arrow
and
lined
on
each
side
with
high
trees
and
a
ditch
in
about
an
hour
we
stopped
near
to
the
farmhouse
of
the
woman
who
was
in
charge
of
us
do
you
observe
that
wood
said
she
to
pointing
to
one
about
half
a
mile
from
the
road
i
dare
not
take
you
into
the
house
my
husband
is
so
violent
against
the
english
who
captured
his
schuyt
and
made
him
a
poor
man
that
he
would
inform
against
you
immediately
but
go
you
there
make
yourselves
as
comfortable
as
you
can
and
i
will
send
you
what
you
want
je
vous
plains
pauvre
said
she
looking
at
me
as
she
drove
off
in
the
cart
towards
her
own
house
peter
said
i
think
that
her
kicking
us
out
of
her
house
is
a
proof
of
her
sincerity
and
therefore
i
say
no
more
about
it
we
have
the
to
keep
up
our
spirits
now
then
for
the
wood
though
by
the
powers
i
shall
have
no
relish
for
any
of
your
parties
as
they
call
them
for
the
next
twelve
years
but
how
can
i
get
over
this
ditch
in
petticoats
i
could
hardly
leap
it
in
my
own
clothes
you
must
tie
your
petticoats
round
your
waist
and
make
a
good
run
get
over
as
far
as
you
can
and
i
will
drag
you
through
the
rest
but
you
forget
that
we
are
to
sleep
in
the
wood
and
that
it
no
laughing
matter
to
get
wet
through
freezing
so
hard
as
it
does
now
very
true
peter
but
as
the
snow
lies
so
deep
upon
the
ditch
perhaps
the
ice
may
bear
i
try
if
it
bears
me
it
will
not
condescend
to
bend
at
your
shrimp
of
a
carcass
tried
the
ice
which
was
firm
and
we
both
walked
over
and
making
all
the
haste
we
could
arrived
at
the
wood
as
the
woman
called
it
but
which
was
not
more
than
a
clump
of
trees
of
about
half
an
acre
we
cleared
away
the
snow
for
about
six
feet
round
a
very
hollow
part
and
then
cut
stakes
and
fixed
them
in
the
earth
to
which
we
stretched
one
blanket
the
snow
being
about
two
feet
deep
there
was
plenty
of
room
to
creep
underneath
the
blanket
we
then
collected
all
the
leaves
we
could
beating
the
snow
off
them
and
laid
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
over
the
leaves
we
spread
the
other
blanket
and
taking
our
bundles
in
we
then
stopped
up
with
snow
every
side
of
the
upper
blanket
except
the
hole
to
creep
in
at
it
was
quite
astonishing
what
a
warm
place
this
became
in
a
short
time
after
we
had
remained
in
it
it
was
almost
too
warm
although
the
weather
outside
was
piercingly
cold
after
a
good
meal
and
a
dose
of
brandy
we
both
fell
fast
asleep
but
not
until
i
had
taken
off
my
woman
attire
and
resumed
my
own
clothes
we
never
slept
better
or
more
warmly
than
we
did
in
this
hole
which
we
had
made
on
the
ground
covered
with
ice
and
snow
chapter
xxv
parts
company
to
hunt
for
provisions
and
i
have
other
company
in
consequence
of
another
hunt
pathetically
mourns
my
death
and
finds
me
alive
we
escape
the
ensuing
morning
we
looked
out
anxiously
for
the
promised
assistance
for
we
were
not
very
rich
in
provisions
although
what
we
had
were
of
a
very
good
quality
it
was
not
until
three
in
the
afternoon
that
we
perceived
a
little
girl
coming
towards
us
escorted
by
a
large
mastiff
when
she
arrived
at
the
copse
of
trees
where
we
lay
concealed
she
cried
out
to
the
dog
in
dutch
who
immediately
scoured
the
wood
until
he
came
to
our
when
he
crouched
down
at
the
entrance
barking
furiously
and
putting
us
in
no
small
dread
lest
he
should
attack
us
but
the
little
girl
spoke
to
him
again
and
he
remained
in
the
same
position
looking
at
us
wagging
his
tail
with
his
under
jaw
lying
on
the
snow
she
soon
came
up
and
looking
underneath
put
a
basket
in
and
nodded
her
head
we
emptied
the
basket
took
out
a
napoleon
and
offered
it
to
her
she
refused
it
but
forced
it
into
her
hand
upon
which
she
again
spoke
to
the
dog
who
commenced
barking
so
furiously
at
us
that
we
expected
every
moment
he
would
fly
upon
us
the
girl
at
the
same
time
presented
the
napoleon
and
pointing
to
the
dog
i
went
forward
and
took
the
napoleon
from
her
at
which
she
immediately
silenced
the
enormous
brute
and
laughing
at
us
hastened
away
by
the
powers
that
a
fine
little
girl
said
i
back
her
and
her
dog
against
any
man
well
i
never
had
a
dog
set
at
me
for
giving
money
before
but
we
live
and
learn
peter
now
let
see
what
she
brought
in
the
basket
we
found
eggs
bread
and
a
smoked
mutton
ham
with
a
large
bottle
of
gin
what
a
nice
little
girl
i
hope
she
will
often
favour
us
with
her
company
i
been
thinking
peter
that
we
quite
as
well
off
here
as
in
a
midshipman
berth
you
forget
you
are
a
lieutenant
well
so
i
did
peter
and
that
the
truth
but
it
the
force
of
habit
now
let
make
our
dinner
it
a
way
though
of
making
a
meal
lying
down
but
however
it
economical
for
it
must
take
longer
to
swallow
the
victuals
the
romans
used
to
eat
their
meals
lying
down
so
i
have
read
i
ca
say
that
i
ever
heard
it
mentioned
in
ireland
but
that
prove
that
it
was
not
the
case
so
peter
i
take
your
word
for
it
murder
how
fast
it
snows
again
i
wonder
what
my
father
thinking
on
just
at
this
moment
this
observation
of
induced
us
to
talk
about
our
friends
and
relations
in
england
and
after
much
conversation
we
fell
fast
asleep
the
next
morning
we
found
the
snow
had
fallen
about
eight
inches
and
weighed
down
our
upper
blanket
so
much
that
we
were
obliged
to
go
out
and
cut
stakes
to
support
it
up
from
the
inside
while
we
were
thus
employed
we
heard
a
loud
noise
and
shouting
and
perceived
several
men
apparently
armed
and
accompanied
with
dogs
running
straight
in
the
direction
of
the
wood
where
we
were
encamped
we
were
much
alarmed
thinking
that
they
were
in
search
of
us
but
on
a
sudden
they
turned
off
in
another
direction
continuing
with
the
same
speed
as
before
what
could
it
be
said
i
to
i
ca
exactly
say
peter
but
i
should
think
that
they
were
hunting
something
and
the
only
game
that
i
think
likely
to
be
in
such
a
place
as
this
are
otters
i
was
of
the
same
opinion
we
expected
the
little
girl
but
she
did
not
come
and
after
looking
out
for
her
till
dark
we
crawled
into
our
hole
and
supped
upon
the
remainder
of
our
provisions
the
next
day
as
may
be
supposed
we
were
very
anxious
for
her
arrival
but
she
did
not
appear
at
the
time
expected
night
again
came
on
and
we
went
to
bed
without
having
any
sustenance
except
a
small
piece
of
bread
that
was
left
and
some
gin
which
was
remaining
in
the
flask
peter
said
if
she
do
come
again
i
try
what
i
can
do
for
i
no
idea
of
our
dying
of
hunger
here
like
the
two
babes
in
the
wood
and
being
found
covered
up
with
dead
leaves
if
she
does
not
appear
at
three
i
off
for
provisions
and
i
do
see
much
danger
for
in
this
dress
i
look
as
much
of
a
boor
as
any
man
in
holland
we
passed
an
uneasy
night
as
we
felt
convinced
either
that
the
danger
was
so
great
that
they
dared
not
venture
to
assist
us
or
that
being
they
had
betrayed
us
and
left
us
to
manage
how
we
could
the
next
morning
i
climbed
up
the
only
large
tree
in
the
copse
and
looked
round
especially
in
the
direction
of
the
belonging
to
the
woman
who
had
pointed
out
to
us
our
place
of
concealment
but
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
one
vast
tract
of
flat
country
covered
with
snow
and
now
and
then
a
vehicle
passing
at
a
distance
on
the
middelburg
road
i
descended
and
found
preparing
for
a
start
he
was
very
melancholy
and
said
to
me
peter
if
i
am
taken
you
must
at
all
risks
put
on
your
girl
clothes
and
go
to
flushing
to
the
cabaret
the
women
there
i
am
sure
will
protect
you
and
send
you
back
to
england
i
only
want
two
napoleons
take
all
the
rest
you
will
require
them
if
i
am
not
back
by
set
off
for
flushing
morning
waited
some
time
longer
talking
with
me
and
it
then
being
past
four
he
shook
me
by
the
hand
and
without
speaking
left
the
wood
i
never
felt
more
miserable
during
the
whole
time
since
we
were
first
put
into
prison
at
toulon
till
that
moment
and
when
he
was
a
hundred
yards
off
i
knelt
down
and
prayed
he
had
been
absent
two
hours
and
it
was
quite
dusk
when
i
heard
a
noise
at
a
distance
it
advanced
every
moment
nearer
and
nearer
on
a
sudden
i
heard
a
rustling
of
the
bushes
and
hastened
under
the
blanket
which
was
covered
with
snow
in
hopes
that
they
might
not
perceive
the
entrance
but
i
was
hardly
there
before
in
dashed
after
me
an
enormous
wolf
i
cried
out
expecting
to
be
torn
to
pieces
every
moment
but
the
creature
lay
on
his
belly
his
mouth
wide
open
his
eyes
glaring
and
his
long
tongue
hanging
out
of
his
mouth
and
although
he
touched
me
he
was
so
exhausted
that
he
did
not
attack
me
the
noise
increased
and
i
immediately
perceived
that
it
was
the
hunters
in
pursuit
of
him
i
had
crawled
in
feet
first
the
wolf
ran
in
head
foremost
so
that
we
lay
head
and
tail
i
crept
out
as
fast
as
i
could
and
perceived
men
and
dogs
not
two
hundred
yards
off
in
full
chase
i
hastened
to
the
large
tree
and
had
not
ascended
six
feet
when
they
came
up
the
dogs
flew
to
the
hole
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
wolf
was
killed
the
hunters
being
too
busy
to
observe
me
i
had
in
the
meantime
climbed
up
the
trunk
of
the
tree
and
hidden
myself
as
well
as
i
could
being
not
fifteen
yards
from
them
i
heard
their
expressions
of
surprise
as
they
lifted
up
the
blanket
and
dragged
out
the
dead
wolf
which
they
carried
away
with
them
their
conversation
being
in
dutch
i
could
not
understand
it
but
i
was
certain
that
they
made
use
of
the
word
the
hunters
and
dogs
quitted
the
copse
and
i
was
about
to
descend
when
one
of
them
returned
and
pulling
up
the
blankets
rolled
them
together
and
walked
away
with
them
fortunately
he
did
not
perceive
our
bundles
by
the
little
light
given
by
the
moon
i
waited
a
short
time
and
then
came
down
what
to
do
i
knew
not
if
i
did
not
remain
and
returned
what
would
he
think
if
i
did
i
should
be
dead
with
cold
before
the
morning
i
looked
for
our
bundles
and
found
that
in
the
conflict
between
the
dogs
and
the
wolf
they
had
been
buried
among
the
leaves
i
recollected
advice
and
dressed
myself
in
the
girl
clothes
but
i
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
go
to
flushing
so
i
resolved
to
walk
towards
the
farmhouse
which
being
close
to
the
road
would
give
me
a
chance
of
meeting
with
i
soon
arrived
there
and
prowled
round
it
for
some
time
but
the
doors
and
windows
were
all
fast
and
i
dared
not
knock
after
what
the
woman
had
said
about
her
husband
inveteracy
to
the
english
at
last
as
i
looked
round
and
round
quite
at
a
loss
what
to
do
i
thought
i
saw
a
figure
at
a
distance
proceeding
in
the
direction
of
the
copse
i
hastened
after
it
and
saw
it
enter
i
then
advanced
very
cautiously
for
although
i
thought
it
might
be
yet
it
was
possible
that
it
was
one
of
the
men
who
chased
the
wolf
in
search
of
more
plunder
but
i
soon
heard
voice
and
i
hastened
towards
him
i
was
close
to
him
without
his
perceiving
me
and
found
him
sitting
down
with
his
face
covered
up
in
his
two
hands
at
last
he
cried
o
pater
my
poor
pater
are
you
taken
at
last
could
i
not
leave
you
for
one
hour
in
safety
ochone
why
did
i
leave
you
my
poor
poor
pater
simple
you
were
sure
enough
and
that
why
i
loved
you
but
pater
i
would
have
made
a
man
of
you
for
you
all
the
materials

truth
and
a
fine
man
too
where

to
look
for
you

i
to
find

time

england

why
then
we
go
back
to
that
blackguard
hole
at
givet
together
ochone
ochone
spoke
no
more
but
burst
into
tears
i
was
much
affected
with
this
proof
of
sincere
regard
and
i
came
to
his
side
and
clasped
him
in
my
arms
stared
at
me
who
are
you
you
ugly
dutch
frow
for
he
had
quite
forgotten
the
woman
dress
at
the
moment
but
recollecting
himself
he
hugged
me
in
his
arms
pater
you
come
as
near
to
an
angel
shape
as
you
can
for
you
come
in
that
of
a
woman
to
comfort
me
for
to
tell
the
truth
i
was
very
much
distressed
at
not
finding
you
here
and
all
the
blankets
gone
to
boot
what
has
been
the
matter
i
explained
in
as
few
words
as
i
could
well
peter
i
happy
to
find
you
all
safe
and
much
happier
to
find
that
you
can
be
trusted
when
i
leave
you
for
you
could
not
have
behaved
more
prudently
now
i
tell
you
what
i
did
which
was
not
much
as
it
happened
i
knew
that
there
was
no
cabaret
between
us
and
flushing
for
i
took
particular
notice
as
i
came
along
so
i
took
the
road
to
middelburg
and
found
but
one
which
was
full
of
soldiers
i
passed
it
and
found
no
other
as
i
came
back
past
the
same
cabaret
one
of
the
soldiers
came
out
to
me
but
i
walked
along
the
road
he
quickened
his
pace
and
so
did
i
mine
for
i
expected
mischief
at
last
he
came
up
to
me
and
spoke
to
me
in
dutch
to
which
i
gave
him
no
answer
he
collared
me
and
then
i
thought
it
convenient
to
pretend
that
i
was
deaf
and
dumb
i
pointed
to
my
mouth
with
an
au
au
and
then
to
my
ears
and
shook
my
head
but
he
would
not
be
convinced
and
i
heard
him
say
something
about
english
i
then
knew
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
so
i
first
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
and
stopped
and
on
his
attempting
to
force
me
i
kicked
up
his
heels
and
he
fell
on
the
ice
with
such
a
rap
on
the
pate
that
i
doubt
if
he
has
recovered
it
by
this
time
there
i
left
him
and
have
run
back
as
hard
as
i
could
without
anything
for
peter
to
fill
his
little
hungry
inside
with
now
peter
what
your
opinion
for
they
say
that
out
of
the
mouth
of
babes
there
is
wisdom
and
although
i
never
saw
anything
come
out
of
their
mouths
but
sour
milk
yet
perhaps
i
may
be
more
fortunate
this
time
for
peter
you
but
a
baby
not
a
small
one
although
not
quite
so
large
as
that
you
told
me
the
story
of
my
idea
is
let
us
at
all
hazards
go
to
the
farmhouse
they
have
assisted
us
and
may
be
inclined
to
do
so
again
if
they
refuse
we
must
push
on
to
flushing
and
take
our
chance
well
observed
after
a
pause
i
think
we
can
do
no
better
so
let
be
off
we
went
to
the
farmhouse
and
as
we
approached
the
door
were
met
by
the
great
mastiff
i
started
back
boldly
advanced
he
a
clever
dog
and
may
know
us
again
i
go
up
said
not
stopping
while
he
spoke
and
pat
his
head
if
he
flies
at
me
i
shall
be
no
worse
than
i
was
before
for
depend
upon
it
he
will
not
allow
us
to
go
back
again
by
this
time
had
advanced
to
the
dog
who
looked
earnestly
and
angrily
at
him
he
patted
his
head
the
dog
growled
but
put
his
arm
round
his
neck
and
patting
him
again
whistled
to
him
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
farmhouse
the
dog
followed
him
silently
but
closely
knocked
and
the
door
was
opened
by
the
little
girl
the
mastiff
advanced
to
the
girl
and
then
turned
round
facing
as
much
as
to
say
is
he
to
come
in
the
girl
spoke
to
the
dog
and
went
indoors
during
her
absence
the
mastiff
lay
down
at
the
threshold
in
a
few
seconds
the
woman
who
had
brought
us
from
flushing
came
out
and
desired
us
to
enter
she
spoke
very
good
french
and
told
us
that
fortunately
her
husband
was
absent
that
the
reason
why
we
had
not
been
supplied
was
that
a
wolf
had
met
her
little
girl
returning
the
other
day
but
had
been
beaten
off
by
the
mastiff
and
that
she
was
afraid
to
allow
her
to
go
again
that
she
heard
the
wolf
had
been
killed
this
evening
and
had
intended
her
girl
to
have
gone
to
us
early
morning
that
wolves
were
hardly
known
in
that
country
but
that
the
severe
winter
had
brought
them
down
to
the
lowlands
a
very
rare
circumstance
occurring
perhaps
not
once
in
twenty
years
but
how
did
you
pass
the
mastiff
said
she
that
has
surprised
my
daughter
and
me
told
her
upon
which
she
said
that
the
english
were
really
no
other
man
had
ever
done
the
same
so
i
thought
for
nothing
would
have
induced
me
to
do
it
then
told
the
history
of
the
death
of
the
wolf
with
all
particulars
and
our
intention
if
we
could
not
do
better
of
returning
to
flushing
i
heard
that
pierre
eustache
came
home
yesterday
replied
the
woman
and
i
do
think
that
you
will
be
safer
there
than
here
for
they
will
never
think
of
looking
for
you
among
the
which
join
their
cabaret
will
you
lend
us
your
assistance
to
get
in
i
will
see
what
i
can
do
but
are
you
not
hungry
about
as
hungry
as
men
who
have
eaten
nothing
for
two
days
dieu
i
never
thought
it
was
so
long
but
those
whose
stomachs
are
filled
forget
those
who
are
empty
god
make
us
better
and
more
charitable
she
spoke
to
the
little
girl
in
dutch
who
hastened
to
load
the
table
which
we
hastened
to
empty
the
little
girl
stared
at
our
voracity
but
at
last
she
laughed
out
and
clapped
her
hands
at
every
fresh
mouthful
which
we
took
and
pressed
us
to
eat
more
she
allowed
me
to
kiss
her
until
her
mother
told
her
that
i
was
not
a
woman
when
she
pouted
at
me
and
beat
me
off
before
midnight
we
were
fast
asleep
upon
the
benches
before
the
kitchen
fire
and
at
daybreak
were
roused
up
by
the
woman
who
offered
us
some
bread
and
spirits
and
then
we
went
out
to
the
door
where
we
found
the
horse
and
cart
all
ready
and
loaded
with
vegetables
for
the
market
the
woman
the
little
girl
and
myself
got
in
leading
as
before
and
the
mastiff
following
we
had
learnt
the
name
which
was
and
he
seemed
to
be
quite
fond
of
us
we
passed
the
dreaded
barriers
without
interruption
and
in
ten
minutes
entered
the
cabaret
of
eustache
and
immediately
walked
into
the
little
room
through
a
crowd
of
soldiers
two
of
whom
chucked
me
under
the
chin
whom
should
we
find
there
but
eustache
the
pilot
himself
in
conversation
with
his
wife
and
it
appeared
that
they
were
talking
about
us
she
insisting
and
he
unwilling
to
have
any
hand
in
the
business
well
here
they
are
themselves
eustache
the
soldiers
who
have
seen
them
come
in
will
never
believe
that
this
is
their
first
entry
if
you
give
them
up
i
leave
them
to
make
their
own
bargain
but
mark
me
eustache
i
have
slaved
night
and
day
in
this
cabaret
for
your
profit
if
you
do
not
oblige
me
and
my
family
i
no
longer
keep
a
cabaret
for
you
madame
eustache
then
quitted
the
room
with
her
husband
sister
and
little
girl
and
immediately
accosted
him
i
promise
you
said
he
to
eustache
one
hundred
louis
if
you
put
us
on
shore
at
any
part
of
england
or
on
board
of
any
english
and
if
you
do
it
within
a
week
i
will
make
it
twenty
louis
more
then
pulled
out
the
fifty
napoleons
given
us
by
celeste
for
our
own
were
not
yet
expended
and
laid
them
on
the
table
here
is
this
in
advance
to
prove
my
sincerity
say
is
it
a
bargain
or
not
i
never
yet
heard
of
a
poor
man
who
could
withstand
his
arguments
backed
with
one
hundred
and
twenty
louis
said
eustache
smiling
and
sweeping
the
money
off
the
table
i
presume
you
have
no
objection
to
start
that
will
be
ten
louis
more
in
your
favour
replied
i
shall
earn
them
replied
eustache
the
sooner
i
am
off
the
better
for
i
could
not
long
conceal
you
here
the
young
frow
with
you
is
i
suppose
your
companion
that
my
wife
mentioned
he
has
begun
to
suffer
hardships
early
come
now
sit
down
and
talk
for
nothing
can
be
done
till
dark
narrated
the
adventures
attending
our
escape
at
which
eustache
laughed
heartily
the
more
so
at
the
mistake
which
his
wife
was
under
as
to
the
obligations
of
the
family
if
i
did
not
feel
inclined
to
assist
you
before
i
do
now
just
for
the
laugh
i
shall
have
at
her
when
i
come
back
and
if
she
wants
any
more
assistance
for
the
sake
of
her
relations
i
shall
remind
her
of
this
anecdote
but
she
a
good
woman
and
a
good
wife
to
boot
only
too
fond
of
her
sisters
at
dusk
he
equipped
us
both
in
sailor
jackets
and
trowsers
and
desired
us
to
follow
him
boldly
he
passed
the
guard
who
knew
him
well
what
to
sea
already
said
one
you
have
quarrelled
with
your
wife
at
which
they
all
laughed
and
we
joined
we
gained
the
beach
jumped
into
his
little
boat
pulled
off
to
his
vessel
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
under
weigh
with
a
strong
tide
and
a
fair
wind
we
were
soon
clear
of
the
scheldt
and
the
next
morning
a
cutter
hove
in
sight
we
steered
for
her
ran
under
her
lee
hailed
for
a
boat
and
eustache
receiving
my
bill
for
the
remainder
of
his
money
wished
us
success
we
shook
hands
and
in
a
few
minutes
found
ourselves
once
more
under
the
british
pennant
chapter
xxvi
adventures
at
home
i
am
introduced
to
my
grandfather
he
obtains
employment
for
and
myself
and
we
join
a
frigate
as
soon
as
we
were
on
the
deck
of
the
cutter
the
lieutenant
commanding
her
inquired
of
us
in
a
consequential
manner
who
we
were
replied
that
we
were
english
prisoners
who
had
escaped
oh
midshipmen
i
presume
replied
the
lieutenant
i
heard
that
some
had
contrived
to
get
away
my
name
sir
said
is
lieutenant
and
if
you
send
for
a
list
i
will
have
the
honour
of
pointing
it
out
to
you
this
young
gentleman
is
mr
peter
simple
midshipman
and
grandson
to
the
right
honourable
lord
viscount
privilege
the
lieutenant
who
was
a
little
man
with
a
pimply
face
then
altered
his
manner
towards
us
and
begged
we
would
step
down
into
the
cabin
where
he
offered
what
perhaps
was
the
greatest
of
all
luxuries
to
us
some
english
cheese
and
bottled
porter
pray
said
he
did
you
see
anything
of
one
of
my
officers
who
was
taken
prisoner
when
i
was
sent
with
despatches
to
the
mediterranean
fleet
may
i
first
ask
the
name
of
your
lively
little
craft
said
snapper
replied
the
lieutenant
och
murder
sure
enough
we
met
him
he
was
sent
to
verdun
but
we
had
the
pleasure
of
his
company
as
far
as
montpelier
a
remarkably
genteel
young
man
was
he
not
why
i
ca
say
much
about
his
gentility
indeed
i
am
not
much
of
a
judge
as
for
his
dress
he
ought
to
have
dressed
well
but
he
never
did
when
on
board
of
me
his
father
is
my
tailor
and
i
took
him
as
midshipman
just
to
square
an
account
between
us
that
exactly
what
i
thought
replied
he
did
not
say
any
more
which
i
was
glad
of
as
the
lieutenant
might
not
have
been
pleased
at
what
had
occurred
when
do
you
expect
to
run
into
port
demanded
for
we
were
rather
anxious
to
put
our
feet
ashore
again
in
old
england
the
lieutenant
replied
that
his
cruise
was
nearly
up
and
he
considered
our
arrival
quite
sufficient
reason
for
him
to
run
in
directly
and
that
he
intended
to
put
his
helm
up
after
the
people
had
had
their
dinner
we
were
much
delighted
with
this
intelligence
and
still
more
to
see
the
intention
put
into
execution
half
an
hour
afterwards
in
three
days
we
anchored
at
spithead
and
went
on
shore
with
the
lieutenant
to
report
ourselves
to
the
admiral
oh
with
what
joy
did
i
first
put
my
foot
on
the
shingle
beach
at
sallyport
and
then
hasten
to
the
to
put
in
a
long
letter
which
i
had
written
to
my
mother
we
did
not
go
to
the
admiral
but
merely
reported
ourselves
at
the
admiral
office
for
we
had
no
clothes
fit
to
appear
in
but
we
called
at
meredith
the
tailor
and
he
promised
that
by
the
next
morning
we
should
be
fitted
complete
we
then
ordered
new
hats
and
everything
we
required
and
went
to
the
fountain
inn
refused
to
go
to
the
blue
posts
as
being
only
a
receptacle
for
midshipmen
by
eleven
the
next
morning
we
were
fit
to
appear
before
the
admiral
who
received
us
very
kindly
and
requested
our
company
to
dinner
as
i
did
not
intend
setting
off
for
home
until
i
had
received
an
answer
from
my
mother
we
of
course
accepted
the
invitation
there
was
a
large
party
of
naval
officers
and
ladies
and
amused
them
very
much
during
dinner
when
the
ladies
left
the
room
the
admiral
wife
told
me
to
come
up
with
them
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
the
ladies
all
gathered
round
me
and
i
had
to
narrate
the
whole
of
my
adventures
which
very
much
entertained
and
interested
them
the
next
morning
i
received
a
letter
from
my
mother
such
a
kind
one
entreating
me
to
come
home
as
fast
as
i
could
and
bring
my
with
me
i
showed
it
to
and
asked
him
whether
he
would
accompany
me
why
peter
my
boy
i
have
a
little
business
of
some
importance
to
transact
which
is
to
obtain
my
arrears
of
pay
and
some
which
i
find
due
when
i
have
settled
that
point
i
will
go
to
town
to
pay
my
respects
to
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
then
i
think
i
will
go
and
see
your
father
and
mother
for
until
i
know
how
matters
stand
and
whether
i
shall
be
able
to
go
with
spare
cash
in
my
pocket
i
do
not
wish
to
see
my
own
family
so
write
down
your
address
here
and
you
be
sure
i
come
if
it
is
only
to
square
my
accounts
with
you
for
i
am
not
a
little
in
your
debt
i
cashed
a
cheque
sent
by
my
father
and
set
off
in
the
mail
that
night
the
next
evening
i
arrived
safe
home
but
i
shall
leave
the
reader
to
imagine
the
scene
to
my
mother
i
was
always
dear
and
circumstances
had
rendered
me
of
some
importance
to
my
father
for
i
was
now
an
only
son
and
his
prospects
were
very
different
from
what
they
were
when
i
left
home
about
a
week
afterwards
joined
us
having
got
through
all
his
business
his
first
act
was
to
account
with
my
father
for
his
share
of
the
expenses
and
he
even
insisted
upon
paying
his
half
of
the
fifty
napoleons
given
me
by
celeste
which
had
been
remitted
to
a
banker
at
paris
before
arrival
with
a
guarded
letter
of
thanks
from
my
father
to
colonel
and
another
from
me
to
dear
little
celeste
when
had
remained
with
us
about
a
week
he
told
me
that
he
had
about
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
in
his
pocket
and
that
he
intended
to
go
and
see
his
friends
as
he
was
sure
that
he
would
be
welcome
even
to
father
i
mean
to
stay
with
them
about
a
fortnight
and
shall
then
return
and
apply
for
employment
now
peter
will
you
like
to
be
again
under
my
protection
i
will
never
quit
you
or
your
ship
if
i
can
help
it
spoken
like
a
sensible
peter
well
then
i
was
promised
immediate
employment
and
i
will
let
you
know
as
soon
as
the
promise
is
performed
took
his
leave
of
my
family
who
were
already
very
partial
to
him
and
left
that
afternoon
for
holyhead
my
father
no
longer
treated
me
as
a
child
indeed
it
would
have
been
an
injustice
if
he
had
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
i
was
a
clever
boy
but
i
had
seen
much
of
the
world
in
a
short
time
and
could
act
and
think
for
myself
he
often
talked
to
me
about
his
prospects
which
were
very
different
from
what
they
were
when
i
left
him
my
two
uncles
his
elder
brothers
had
died
the
third
was
married
and
had
two
daughters
if
he
had
no
son
my
father
would
succeed
to
the
title
the
death
of
my
elder
brother
tom
had
brought
me
next
in
succession
my
grandfather
lord
privilege
who
had
taken
no
more
notice
of
my
father
than
occasionally
sending
him
a
basket
of
game
had
latterly
often
invited
him
to
the
house
and
had
even
requested
day
or
to
see
his
wife
and
family
he
had
also
made
a
handsome
addition
to
my
father
income
which
the
death
of
my
two
uncles
had
enabled
him
to
do
against
all
this
my
uncle
wife
was
reported
to
be
again
in
the
family
way
i
can
not
say
that
i
was
pleased
when
my
father
used
to
speculate
upon
these
chances
so
often
as
he
did
i
thought
not
only
as
a
man
but
more
particularly
as
a
clergyman
he
was
much
to
blame
but
i
did
not
know
then
so
much
of
the
world
we
had
not
heard
from
for
two
months
when
a
letter
arrived
stating
that
he
had
seen
his
family
and
bought
a
few
acres
of
land
which
had
made
them
all
quite
happy
and
had
quitted
with
father
double
blessing
with
unlimited
absolution
that
he
had
now
been
a
month
in
town
trying
for
employment
but
found
that
he
could
not
obtain
it
although
one
promise
was
backed
up
by
another
a
few
days
after
this
my
father
received
a
note
from
lord
privilege
requesting
he
would
come
and
spend
a
few
days
with
him
and
bring
his
son
peter
who
had
escaped
from
the
french
prison
of
course
this
was
an
invitation
not
to
be
neglected
and
we
accepted
it
forthwith
i
must
say
i
felt
rather
in
awe
of
my
grandfather
he
had
kept
the
family
at
such
a
distance
that
i
had
always
heard
his
name
mentioned
more
with
reverence
than
with
any
feeling
of
kindred
but
i
was
a
little
wiser
now
we
arrived
at
eagle
park
a
splendid
estate
where
he
resided
and
were
received
by
a
dozen
servants
in
and
out
of
livery
and
ushered
into
his
presence
he
was
in
his
library
a
large
room
surrounded
with
handsome
bookcases
sitting
on
an
easy
chair
a
more
venerable
placid
old
gentleman
i
never
beheld
his
grey
hairs
hung
down
on
each
side
of
his
temples
and
were
collected
in
a
small
behind
he
rose
and
bowed
as
we
were
announced
to
my
father
he
held
out
fingers
in
salutation
to
me
only
but
there
was
an
elegance
in
the
manner
in
which
it
was
done
which
was
indescribable
he
waved
his
hand
to
chairs
placed
by
the
out
of
livery
and
requested
we
would
be
seated
i
could
not
at
the
time
help
thinking
of
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
and
his
remarks
upon
high
breeding
which
were
so
true
and
i
laughed
to
myself
when
i
recollected
that
mr
chucks
had
once
dined
with
him
as
soon
as
the
servants
had
quitted
the
room
the
distance
on
the
part
of
my
grandfather
appeared
to
wear
off
he
interrogated
me
on
several
points
and
seemed
pleased
with
my
replies
but
he
always
called
me
child
after
a
conversation
of
half
an
hour
my
father
rose
saying
that
his
lordship
must
be
busy
and
that
we
would
go
over
the
grounds
till
my
grandfather
rose
and
we
took
a
sort
of
formal
leave
but
it
was
not
a
formal
leave
after
all
it
was
high
breeding
respecting
yourself
and
respecting
others
for
my
part
i
was
pleased
with
the
first
interview
and
so
i
told
my
father
after
we
had
left
the
room
my
dear
peter
replied
he
your
grandfather
has
one
idea
which
absorbs
most
others
the
peerage
the
estate
and
the
descent
of
it
in
the
right
line
as
long
as
your
uncles
were
alive
we
were
not
thought
of
as
not
being
in
the
line
of
descent
nor
should
we
now
but
that
your
uncle
william
has
only
daughters
still
we
are
not
looked
upon
as
actual
but
only
contingent
inheritors
of
the
title
were
your
uncle
to
die
the
difference
in
his
behaviour
would
be
manifested
immediately
that
is
to
say
instead
of
you
would
receive
the
hand
and
instead
of
finger
i
should
obtain
promotion
to
at
this
my
father
laughed
heartily
saying
peter
you
have
exactly
hit
the
mark
i
can
not
imagine
how
we
ever
could
have
been
so
blind
as
to
call
you
the
fool
of
the
family
to
this
i
made
no
reply
for
it
was
difficult
so
to
do
without
depreciating
others
or
depreciating
myself
but
i
changed
the
subject
by
commenting
on
the
beauties
of
the
park
and
the
splendid
timber
with
which
it
was
adorned
yes
peter
replied
my
father
with
a
sigh
thousand
a
year
in
land
money
in
the
funds
and
timber
worth
at
least
forty
thousand
more
are
not
to
be
despised
but
god
wills
everything
after
this
remark
my
father
appeared
to
be
in
deep
thought
and
i
did
not
interrupt
him
we
stayed
ten
days
with
my
grandfather
during
which
he
would
often
detain
me
for
two
hours
after
breakfast
listening
to
my
adventures
and
i
really
believe
was
very
partial
to
me
the
day
before
i
went
away
he
said
child
you
are
going
now
tell
me
what
you
would
like
as
i
wish
to
give
you
a
token
of
regard
do
be
afraid
what
shall
it
be
a
watch
and
seals
or
anything
you
most
fancy
my
lord
replied
i
if
you
wish
to
do
me
a
favour
it
is
that
you
will
apply
to
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
to
appoint
lieutenant
to
a
fine
frigate
and
at
the
same
time
ask
for
a
vacancy
as
midshipman
for
me
replied
his
lordship
i
recollect
it
was
he
who
accompanied
you
from
france
and
appears
by
your
account
to
have
been
a
true
friend
i
am
pleased
with
your
request
my
child
and
it
shall
be
granted
his
lordship
then
desired
me
to
hand
him
the
paper
and
wrote
by
my
directions
sealed
the
letter
and
told
me
he
would
send
me
the
answer
the
next
day
we
quitted
eagle
park
his
lordship
wishing
my
father
with
fingers
and
to
me
extending
as
before
but
he
said
i
am
pleased
with
you
child
you
may
write
occasionally
when
we
were
on
our
route
home
my
father
observed
that
i
had
made
more
progress
with
my
grandfather
than
he
had
known
anyone
to
do
since
he
could
recollect
his
saying
that
you
might
write
to
him
is
at
least
ten
thousand
pounds
to
you
in
his
will
for
he
never
deceives
any
one
or
changes
his
mind
my
reply
was
that
i
should
like
to
see
the
ten
thousand
pounds
but
that
i
was
not
so
sanguine
a
few
days
after
our
return
home
i
received
a
letter
and
enclosure
from
lord
privilege
the
contents
of
which
were
as
follow
my
dear
child
i
send
you
lord
answer
which
i
trust
will
prove
satisfactory
my
compliments
to
your
yours
privilege
the
inclosure
was
a
handsome
letter
from
the
first
lord
stating
that
he
had
appointed
to
the
frigate
and
had
ordered
me
to
be
received
on
board
as
midshipman
i
was
delighted
to
forward
this
letter
to
address
who
in
a
few
days
sent
me
an
answer
thanking
me
and
stating
that
he
had
received
his
and
that
i
need
not
join
for
a
month
which
was
quite
time
enough
as
the
ship
was
refitting
but
that
if
my
family
were
tired
of
me
which
was
sometimes
the
case
in
the
best
regulated
families
why
then
i
should
learn
something
of
my
duty
by
coming
to
portsmouth
he
concluded
by
sending
his
kind
regards
to
all
the
family
and
his
to
my
grandfather
which
last
i
certainly
did
not
forward
in
my
letter
of
thanks
about
a
month
afterwards
i
received
a
letter
from
stating
that
the
ship
was
ready
to
go
out
of
harbour
and
would
be
anchored
off
spithead
in
a
few
days
chapter
xxvii
captain
and
mrs
to
pork
we
go
to
plymouth
and
fall
in
with
our
old
captain
i
immediately
took
leave
of
my
family
and
set
off
for
portsmouth
and
in
two
days
arrived
at
the
fountain
inn
where
was
waiting
to
receive
me
peter
my
boy
i
feel
so
much
obliged
to
you
that
if
your
uncle
wo
go
out
of
the
world
by
fair
means
i
pick
a
quarrel
with
him
and
shoot
him
on
purpose
that
you
may
be
a
lord
as
i
am
determined
you
shall
be
now
come
up
into
my
room
where
we
be
all
alone
and
i
tell
you
all
about
the
ship
and
our
new
captain
in
the
first
place
we
begin
with
the
ship
as
the
most
important
personage
of
the
two
she
a
beauty
i
forget
her
name
before
she
was
taken
but
the
french
know
how
to
build
ships
better
than
keep
them
she
now
called
the
which
means
a
wild
pig
and
by
the
powers
a
ship
she
is
as
you
will
hear
directly
the
captain
name
is
a
very
short
one
and
would
please
mr
chucks
consisting
only
of
two
letters
t
and
o
which
makes
to
his
whole
title
is
captain
john
to
it
would
almost
appear
as
if
somebody
had
broken
off
the
better
half
of
his
name
and
only
left
him
the
commencement
of
it
but
however
it
a
handy
name
to
sign
when
he
pays
off
his
ship
and
now
i
tell
you
what
sort
of
a
looking
craft
he
is
he
built
like
a
dutch
schuyt
great
breadth
of
beam
and
very
square
tuck
he
applied
to
have
the
quarter
galleries
enlarged
in
the
two
last
ships
he
commanded
he
weighs
about
eighteen
stone
rather
more
than
less
he
is
a
sort
of
a
chap
amazingly
ungenteel
not
much
of
an
officer
not
much
of
a
sailor
but
a
devilish
good
hand
at
the
trencher
but
he
only
part
of
the
concern
he
has
his
wife
on
board
who
is
a
sort
of
a
lady
and
very
troublesome
to
boot
what
makes
her
still
more
annoying
is
that
she
has
a
on
board
very
much
out
of
on
which
she
plays
very
much
out
of
holystoning
is
music
compared
with
her
playing
even
the
captain
spaniel
howls
when
she
comes
to
the
high
notes
but
she
affects
the
fine
lady
and
always
treats
the
officers
with
music
when
they
dine
in
the
cabin
which
makes
them
very
glad
to
get
out
of
it
but
i
thought
wives
were
not
permitted
on
board
very
true
but
there
the
worst
part
in
the
man
character
he
knows
that
he
is
not
allowed
to
take
his
wife
to
sea
and
in
consequence
he
never
says
she
his
wife
or
presents
her
on
shore
to
anybody
if
any
of
the
other
captains
ask
how
mrs
to
is
he
replies
well
i
thank
you
but
at
the
same
time
he
gives
a
kind
of
smirk
as
if
to
say
is
not
my
wife
and
although
everybody
knows
that
she
is
yet
he
prefers
that
they
should
think
otherwise
rather
than
be
at
the
expense
of
keeping
her
on
shore
for
you
know
peter
that
although
there
are
regulations
about
wives
there
are
none
with
regard
to
other
women
but
does
his
wife
know
this
inquired
i
i
believe
from
my
heart
she
is
a
party
to
the
whole
transaction
for
report
says
that
she
would
skin
a
flint
if
she
could
she
always
trying
for
presents
from
the
officers
and
in
fact
she
commands
the
ship
really
this
is
not
a
very
pleasant
prospect
whist
wait
a
little
now
i
come
to
the
this
captain
to
is
very
partial
to
pig
and
we
have
as
many
live
pigs
on
board
as
we
have
pigs
of
ballast
the
first
lieutenant
is
right
mad
about
them
at
the
same
time
he
allows
no
pigs
but
his
own
on
board
that
there
may
be
no
confusion
the
manger
is
full
of
pigs
there
are
two
between
the
guns
drawn
from
the
and
converted
into
the
two
amidships
are
full
of
pigs
and
the
geese
and
are
divided
off
into
apartments
for
four
in
the
now
peter
you
see
there
little
or
no
expense
in
keeping
pigs
on
board
of
a
large
frigate
with
so
much
and
whole
peas
for
them
to
eat
and
this
is
the
reason
why
he
keeps
them
for
the
devil
a
bit
of
any
other
stock
has
he
on
board
i
presume
he
means
to
one
of
the
for
breakfast
when
the
ship
sails
the
first
thing
that
he
does
in
the
morning
is
to
go
round
to
his
pigs
with
the
butcher
feeling
one
scratching
the
dirty
ears
of
another
and
then
he
classes
them
his
pigs
his
his
sows
and
so
on
the
old
boar
is
still
at
the
stables
of
this
inn
but
i
hear
he
is
to
come
on
board
with
the
sailing
orders
but
he
is
very
savage
and
is
therefore
left
on
shore
to
the
very
last
moment
now
really
peter
what
with
the
squealing
of
the
pigs
and
his
wife
piano
we
are
almost
driven
mad
i
do
know
which
is
the
worse
of
the
two
if
you
go
aft
you
hear
the
one
if
you
go
forward
you
hear
the
other
by
way
of
variety
and
that
they
say
is
charming
but
is
it
not
shocking
that
such
a
beautiful
frigate
should
be
turned
into
a
and
that
her
should
smell
worse
than
a
muckheap
but
how
does
his
wife
like
the
idea
of
living
only
upon
hog
flesh
she
lord
bless
you
peter
why
she
looks
as
spare
as
a
shark
and
she
has
just
the
appetite
of
one
for
she
a
piece
of
pork
before
it
well
put
on
her
plate
have
you
any
more
such
pleasant
intelligence
to
communicate
no
peter
you
have
the
worst
of
it
the
lieutenants
are
good
officers
and
pleasant
messmates
the
doctor
is
a
little
queer
and
the
purser
thinks
himself
a
wag
the
master
an
old
who
knows
his
duty
and
takes
his
glass
of
grog
the
midshipmen
are
a
very
genteel
set
of
young
men
and
full
of
fun
and
frolic
i
bet
a
wager
there
be
a
bobbery
in
the
before
long
for
they
are
ripe
for
mischief
now
peter
i
hardly
need
say
that
my
cabin
and
everything
i
have
is
at
your
service
and
i
think
if
we
could
only
have
a
devil
of
a
gale
of
wind
or
a
action
to
send
the
overboard
and
smash
the
we
should
do
very
well
the
next
day
i
went
on
board
and
was
shown
down
into
the
cabin
to
report
my
having
joined
mrs
to
a
tall
thin
woman
was
at
her
piano
she
rose
and
asked
me
several
questions
who
my
friends
were
how
much
they
allowed
me
a
year
and
many
other
questions
which
i
thought
impertinent
but
a
captain
wife
is
allowed
to
take
liberties
she
then
asked
me
if
i
was
fond
of
music
that
was
a
difficult
question
as
if
i
said
that
i
was
i
should
in
all
probability
be
obliged
to
hear
it
if
i
said
that
i
was
not
i
might
have
created
a
dislike
in
her
so
i
replied
that
i
was
very
fond
of
music
on
shore
when
it
was
not
interrupted
by
other
noise
ah
then
i
perceive
you
are
a
real
amateur
mr
simple
replied
the
lady
captain
to
then
came
out
of
the
well
youngster
so
you
joined
us
at
last
come
and
dine
with
us
and
as
you
go
down
to
your
berth
desire
the
sentry
to
pass
the
word
for
the
butcher
i
want
to
speak
with
him
i
bowed
and
retired
i
was
met
in
the
most
friendly
manner
by
the
officers
and
by
my
own
messmates
who
had
been
prepossessed
in
my
favour
by
previous
to
my
arrival
in
our
service
you
always
find
young
men
of
the
best
families
on
board
large
frigates
they
being
considered
the
most
eligible
class
of
vessels
i
found
my
messmates
to
be
gentlemen
with
one
or
two
exceptions
but
i
never
met
so
many
wild
young
lads
together
i
sat
down
and
ate
some
dinner
with
them
although
i
was
to
dine
in
the
cabin
for
the
sea
air
made
me
hungry
do
you
dine
in
the
cabin
simple
said
the
caterer
yes
replied
i
then
do
eat
any
pork
my
boy
now
for
you
have
plenty
there
come
gentlemen
fill
your
glasses
we
drink
happiness
to
our
new
messmate
and
pledging
him
we
pledge
ourselves
to
try
to
promote
it
i
just
join
you
in
that
toast
said
walking
into
the
midshipmen
berth
what
is
it
you
drinking
it
in
some
of
collier
port
sir
boy
bring
a
glass
for
mr
here
your
health
peter
and
wishing
you
may
keep
out
of
a
french
prison
this
cruise
mr
montague
as
caterer
i
will
beg
you
will
order
another
candle
that
i
may
see
what
on
the
table
and
then
perhaps
i
may
find
something
i
should
like
to
pick
a
bit
off
here
the
fag
end
of
a
leg
of
mutton
mr
and
there
a
piece
of
boiled
pork
then
i
just
trouble
you
for
a
bit
close
to
the
knuckle
peter
you
dine
in
the
cabin
so
do
i
the
doctor
refused
have
you
heard
when
we
sail
mr
inquired
one
of
my
messmates
i
heard
at
the
admiral
office
that
we
were
expected
to
be
ordered
round
to
plymouth
and
receive
our
orders
there
either
for
the
east
or
west
indies
they
thought
and
indeed
the
stores
we
have
taken
on
board
indicate
that
we
are
going
foreign
but
the
captain
signal
is
just
made
and
probably
the
admiral
has
intelligence
to
communicate
in
about
an
hour
afterwards
the
captain
returned
looking
very
red
and
hot
he
called
the
first
lieutenant
aside
from
the
rest
of
the
officers
who
were
on
deck
to
receive
him
and
told
him
that
we
were
to
start
for
plymouth
next
morning
and
the
admiral
had
told
him
confidentially
that
we
were
to
proceed
to
the
west
indies
with
a
convoy
which
was
then
collecting
he
appeared
to
be
very
much
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
going
to
make
a
feast
for
the
land
crabs
and
certainly
his
gross
habit
of
body
rendered
him
very
unfit
for
the
climate
this
news
was
soon
spread
through
the
ship
and
there
was
of
course
no
little
bustle
and
preparation
the
doctor
who
had
refused
to
dine
in
the
cabin
upon
plea
of
being
unwell
sent
up
to
say
that
he
felt
himself
so
much
better
that
he
should
have
great
pleasure
to
attend
the
summons
and
he
joined
the
first
lieutenant
and
me
as
we
walked
in
we
sat
down
to
table
the
covers
were
removed
and
as
the
midshipmen
prophesied
there
was
plenty
of
soup
made
out
of
a
pig
head
a
boiled
leg
of
pork
and
a
roast
with
the
crackling
on
sausages
and
potatoes
and
pig
pettitoes
i
can
not
say
that
i
disliked
my
dinner
and
i
ate
very
heartily
but
a
roast
came
on
as
a
second
course
which
rather
surprised
me
but
what
surprised
me
more
was
the
quantity
devoured
by
mrs
to
she
handed
her
plate
from
the
boiled
pork
to
the
roast
asked
for
some
pettitoes
tried
the
sausages
and
finished
with
a
whole
plateful
of
and
stuffing
we
had
an
apple
pie
at
the
end
but
as
we
had
already
eaten
apple
sauce
with
the
roast
pork
we
did
not
care
for
it
the
doctor
who
abominated
pork
ate
pretty
well
and
was
excessively
attentive
to
mrs
to
will
you
not
take
a
piece
of
the
roast
pig
doctor
said
the
captain
why
really
captain
to
as
we
are
bound
by
all
reports
to
a
station
where
we
must
not
venture
upon
pork
i
think
i
will
not
refuse
to
take
a
piece
for
i
am
very
fond
of
it
how
do
you
mean
inquired
the
captain
and
his
lady
both
in
a
breath
perhaps
i
may
be
wrongly
informed
replied
the
doctor
but
i
have
heard
that
we
were
ordered
to
the
west
indies
now
if
so
everyone
knows
that
although
you
may
eat
salt
pork
there
occasionally
without
danger
in
all
tropical
climates
and
especially
the
west
indies
two
or
three
days
living
upon
this
meat
will
immediately
produce
dysentery
which
is
always
fatal
in
that
climate
indeed
exclaimed
the
captain
you
do
say
so
rejoined
the
lady
i
do
indeed
and
have
always
avoided
the
west
indies
for
that
very
reason
i
am
so
fond
of
pork
the
doctor
then
proceeded
to
give
nearly
one
hundred
instances
of
messmates
and
shipmen
who
had
been
attacked
with
dysentery
from
the
eating
of
fresh
pork
in
the
west
indies
and
perceiving
the
doctor
drift
joined
him
telling
some
most
astonishing
accounts
of
the
dreadful
effects
of
pork
in
a
hot
country
i
think
he
said
that
when
the
french
were
blockaded
previous
to
the
surrender
of
martinique
that
having
nothing
but
pigs
to
eat
thirteen
hundred
out
of
seventeen
hundred
soldiers
and
officers
died
in
the
course
of
three
weeks
and
the
others
were
so
reduced
by
disease
that
they
were
obliged
to
capitulate
the
doctor
then
changed
the
subject
and
talked
about
the
yellow
fever
and
other
diseases
of
the
climate
so
that
by
his
account
the
west
india
islands
were
but
hospitals
to
die
in
those
most
likely
to
be
attacked
were
men
in
full
strong
health
the
spare
men
stood
a
better
chance
this
conversation
was
carried
on
until
it
was
time
to
leave
mrs
to
at
last
quite
silent
and
the
captain
gulping
down
his
wine
with
a
sigh
when
we
rose
from
the
table
mrs
to
did
not
ask
us
as
usual
to
stay
and
hear
a
little
music
she
was
like
her
piano
not
a
little
out
of
tune
by
the
powers
doctor
you
did
that
nately
said
as
we
left
the
cabin
said
the
doctor
oblige
me
and
you
mr
simple
oblige
me
also
by
not
saying
a
word
in
the
ship
about
what
i
have
said
if
it
once
gets
wind
i
shall
have
done
no
good
but
if
you
both
hold
your
tongues
for
a
short
time
i
think
i
may
promise
you
to
get
rid
of
captain
to
his
wife
and
his
pigs
we
perceived
the
justice
of
his
observation
and
promised
secrecy
the
next
morning
the
ship
sailed
for
plymouth
and
mrs
to
sent
for
the
doctor
not
being
very
well
the
doctor
prescribed
for
her
and
i
believe
on
my
conscience
made
her
worse
on
purpose
the
illness
of
his
wife
and
his
own
fears
brought
captain
to
more
than
usual
in
contact
with
the
doctor
of
whom
he
frequently
asked
his
candid
opinion
as
to
his
own
chance
in
a
hot
country
captain
to
said
the
doctor
never
would
have
given
my
opinion
if
you
had
not
asked
it
for
i
am
aware
that
as
an
officer
you
would
never
flinch
from
your
duty
to
whatever
quarter
of
the
globe
you
may
be
ordered
but
as
you
have
asked
the
question
i
must
say
with
your
full
habit
of
body
i
think
you
would
not
stand
a
chance
of
living
for
more
than
two
months
at
the
same
time
sir
i
may
be
mistaken
but
at
all
events
i
must
point
out
that
mrs
to
is
of
a
very
bilious
habit
and
i
trust
you
will
not
do
such
an
injustice
to
an
amiable
woman
as
to
permit
her
to
accompany
you
thanky
doctor
i
much
obliged
to
you
replied
the
captain
turning
round
and
going
down
the
ladder
to
his
cabin
we
were
then
beating
down
the
channel
for
although
we
ran
through
the
needles
with
a
fair
wind
it
fell
calm
and
shifted
to
the
westward
when
we
were
abreast
of
portland
the
next
day
the
captain
gave
an
order
for
a
very
fine
pig
to
be
killed
for
he
was
out
of
provisions
mrs
to
still
kept
her
bed
and
he
therefore
directed
that
a
part
should
be
salted
as
he
could
have
no
company
i
was
in
the
midshipman
berth
when
some
of
them
proposed
that
we
should
get
possession
of
the
pig
and
the
plan
they
agreed
upon
was
as
follows
they
were
to
go
to
the
pen
that
night
and
with
a
needle
stuck
in
a
piece
of
wood
to
prick
the
pig
all
over
and
then
rub
gunpowder
into
the
parts
wounded
this
was
done
and
although
the
butcher
was
up
a
dozen
times
during
the
night
to
ascertain
what
made
the
pigs
so
uneasy
the
midshipmen
passed
the
needle
from
watch
to
watch
until
the
pig
was
well
tattooed
in
all
parts
in
the
morning
watch
it
was
killed
and
when
it
had
been
scalded
in
the
tub
and
the
hair
taken
off
it
appeared
covered
with
blue
spots
the
midshipman
of
the
morning
watch
who
was
on
the
took
care
to
point
out
to
the
butcher
that
the
pork
was
to
which
the
man
unwillingly
assented
stating
at
the
same
time
that
he
could
not
imagine
how
it
could
be
for
a
finer
pig
he
had
never
put
a
knife
into
the
circumstance
was
reported
to
the
captain
who
was
much
astonished
the
doctor
came
in
to
visit
mrs
to
and
the
captain
requested
the
doctor
to
examine
the
pig
and
give
his
opinion
although
this
was
not
the
doctor
province
yet
as
he
had
great
reason
for
keeping
intimate
with
the
captain
he
immediately
consented
going
forward
he
met
me
and
i
told
him
the
secret
that
will
do
replied
he
it
all
tends
to
what
we
wish
the
doctor
returned
to
the
captain
and
said
that
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
the
pig
was
measly
which
was
a
complaint
very
frequent
on
board
ships
particularly
in
hot
climates
where
all
pork
became
one
great
reason
for
its
there
proving
so
unwholesome
the
captain
sent
for
the
first
lieutenant
and
with
a
deep
sigh
ordered
him
to
throw
the
pig
overboard
but
the
first
lieutenant
who
knew
what
had
been
done
from
ordered
the
to
throw
it
overboard
the
master
mate
touching
his
hat
said
ay
ay
sir
and
took
it
down
into
the
berth
where
we
cut
it
up
salted
one
half
and
the
other
we
finished
before
we
arrived
at
plymouth
which
was
six
days
from
the
time
we
left
portsmouth
on
our
arrival
we
found
part
of
the
convoy
lying
there
but
no
orders
for
us
and
to
my
great
delight
on
the
following
day
the
arrived
from
a
cruise
off
the
western
islands
i
obtained
permission
to
go
on
board
with
and
we
once
more
greeted
our
messmates
mr
falcon
the
first
lieutenant
went
down
to
captain
savage
to
say
we
were
on
board
and
he
requested
us
to
come
into
the
cabin
he
greeted
us
warmly
and
gave
us
great
credit
for
the
manner
in
which
we
had
effected
our
escape
when
we
left
the
cabin
i
found
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
waiting
outside
my
dear
mr
simple
extend
your
flapper
to
me
for
i
delighted
to
see
you
i
long
to
have
a
long
talk
with
you
and
i
should
like
it
also
mr
chucks
but
i
afraid
we
have
not
time
i
dine
with
captain
savage
and
it
only
wants
an
hour
of
well
mr
simple
i
been
looking
at
your
frigate
and
she
a
beauty
much
larger
than
the
and
she
behaves
quite
as
well
replied
i
i
think
we
are
two
hundred
tons
larger
you
no
idea
of
her
size
until
you
are
on
her
decks
i
should
like
to
be
boatswain
of
her
mr
simple
that
is
with
captain
savage
for
i
will
not
part
with
him
i
had
some
more
conversation
with
mr
chucks
but
i
was
obliged
to
attend
to
others
who
interrupted
us
we
had
a
very
pleasant
dinner
with
our
old
captain
to
whom
we
gave
a
history
of
our
adventures
and
then
we
returned
on
board
chapter
xxviii
we
get
rid
of
the
pigs
and
the
last
boat
on
shore
before
sailing
the
first
lieutenant
too
hasty
and
the
consequences
to
me
we
waited
three
days
at
the
expiration
of
which
we
heard
that
captain
to
was
about
to
exchange
with
captain
savage
we
could
not
believe
such
good
news
to
be
true
and
we
could
not
ascertain
the
truth
of
the
report
as
the
captain
had
gone
on
shore
with
mrs
to
who
recovered
fast
after
she
was
out
of
our
doctor
hands
so
fast
indeed
that
a
week
afterwards
on
questioning
the
steward
upon
his
return
on
board
how
mrs
to
was
he
replied
o
charming
well
again
sir
she
has
eaten
a
since
she
left
the
ship
but
the
report
was
true
captain
to
afraid
to
go
to
the
west
indies
had
effected
an
exchange
with
captain
savage
captain
savage
was
permitted
as
was
the
custom
of
the
service
to
bring
his
first
lieutenant
his
boatswain
and
his
crew
with
him
he
joined
a
day
or
two
before
we
sailed
and
never
was
there
more
joy
on
board
the
only
people
miserable
were
the
first
lieutenant
and
those
belonging
to
the
who
were
obliged
to
follow
captain
to
who
with
his
wife
his
pigs
and
her
piano
were
all
got
rid
of
in
the
course
of
one
forenoon
i
have
already
described
on
board
of
a
but
i
think
that
the
two
days
before
sailing
are
even
more
unpleasant
although
generally
speaking
all
our
money
being
spent
we
are
not
sorry
when
we
once
are
fairly
out
of
harbour
and
find
ourselves
in
the
men
never
work
well
on
those
days
they
are
thinking
of
their
wives
and
sweethearts
of
the
pleasure
they
had
when
at
liberty
on
shore
where
they
might
get
drunk
without
punishment
and
many
of
them
are
either
half
drunk
at
the
time
or
suffering
from
the
effects
of
previous
intoxication
the
ship
is
in
disorder
and
crowded
with
the
variety
of
stock
and
spare
stores
which
are
obliged
to
be
taken
on
board
in
a
hurry
and
have
not
yet
been
properly
secured
in
their
places
the
first
lieutenant
is
cross
the
officers
are
grave
and
the
poor
midshipmen
with
all
their
own
little
comforts
to
attend
to
are
harassed
and
driven
about
like
mr
simple
inquired
the
first
lieutenant
where
do
you
come
from
from
the
gun
wharf
sir
with
the
gunner
spare
blocks
and
breechings
very
well
send
the
marines
aft
to
clear
the
boat
and
pipe
away
the
first
putter
mr
simple
jump
into
the
first
cutter
and
go
to
mount
wise
for
the
officers
be
careful
that
none
of
your
men
leave
the
boat
come
be
smart
now
i
had
been
away
the
whole
morning
and
it
was
then
one
and
i
had
had
no
dinner
but
i
said
nothing
and
went
into
the
boat
as
soon
as
i
was
off
who
stood
by
mr
falcon
said
peter
was
thinking
of
his
dinner
poor
fellow
i
really
quite
forgot
it
replied
the
first
lieutenant
there
is
so
much
to
do
he
is
a
willing
boy
and
he
shall
dine
in
the
when
he
comes
back
and
so
i
did
so
i
lost
nothing
by
not
expostulating
and
gained
more
of
the
favour
of
the
first
lieutenant
who
never
forgot
what
he
called
but
the
hardest
trial
of
the
whole
is
to
the
midshipman
who
is
sent
with
the
boat
to
purchase
the
supplies
for
the
cabin
and
on
the
day
before
the
ship
sailing
it
was
my
misfortune
to
be
ordered
upon
that
service
this
time
and
that
very
unexpectedly
i
had
been
ordered
to
dress
myself
to
take
the
gig
on
shore
for
the
captain
orders
and
was
walking
the
deck
with
my
very
best
uniform
and
side
arms
when
the
marine
officer
who
was
the
caterer
came
up
to
the
first
lieutenant
and
asked
him
for
a
boat
the
boat
was
manned
and
a
midshipman
ordered
to
take
charge
of
it
but
when
he
came
up
the
first
lieutenant
recollecting
that
he
had
come
off
two
days
before
with
only
half
his
boat
crew
would
not
trust
him
and
called
out
to
me
here
mr
simple
i
must
send
you
in
this
boat
mind
you
are
careful
that
none
of
the
men
leave
it
and
bring
off
the
sergeant
of
marines
who
is
on
shore
looking
for
the
men
who
have
broken
their
liberty
although
i
could
not
but
feel
proud
of
the
compliment
yet
i
did
not
much
like
going
in
my
very
best
uniform
and
would
have
run
down
and
changed
it
but
the
marine
officer
and
all
the
people
were
in
the
boat
and
i
could
not
keep
it
waiting
so
down
the
side
i
went
and
we
shoved
off
we
had
besides
the
boat
crew
the
marine
officer
the
purser
the
steward
the
captain
steward
and
the
purser
steward
so
that
we
were
pretty
full
it
blew
hard
from
the
and
there
was
a
sea
running
but
as
the
tide
was
flowing
into
the
harbour
there
was
not
much
bubble
we
hoisted
the
foresail
flew
before
the
wind
and
tide
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
at
mutton
cove
when
the
marine
officer
expressed
his
wish
to
land
the
was
crowded
with
boats
and
it
was
not
without
sundry
exchanges
of
foul
words
and
oaths
and
the
dashing
the
point
of
their
into
the
to
make
them
keep
clear
of
us
that
we
forced
our
way
to
the
beach
the
marine
officer
and
all
the
stewards
then
left
the
boat
and
i
had
to
look
after
the
men
i
had
not
been
there
three
minutes
before
the
said
that
his
wife
was
on
the
wharf
with
his
clothes
from
the
wash
and
begged
leave
to
go
and
fetch
them
i
refused
telling
him
that
she
could
bring
them
to
him
vy
now
mr
simple
said
the
woman
you
a
nice
lady
man
to
go
for
to
ax
me
to
muddle
my
way
through
all
the
dead
dogs
and
stinking
hakes
heads
with
my
bran
new
shoes
and
clean
stockings
i
looked
at
her
and
sure
enough
she
was
as
they
say
in
france
come
mr
simple
let
him
out
to
come
for
his
clothes
and
you
see
that
he
back
in
a
moment
i
did
not
like
to
refuse
her
as
it
was
very
dirty
and
wet
and
the
shingle
was
strewed
with
all
that
she
had
mentioned
the
made
a
spring
out
with
his
threw
it
back
went
up
to
his
wife
and
commenced
talking
with
her
while
i
watched
him
if
you
please
sir
there
my
young
woman
come
down
may
i
speak
to
her
said
another
of
the
men
i
turned
round
and
refused
him
he
expostulated
and
begged
very
hard
but
i
was
resolute
however
when
i
again
turned
my
eyes
to
watch
the
he
and
his
wife
were
gone
there
says
i
to
the
coxswain
i
knew
it
would
be
so
you
see
hickman
is
off
only
gone
to
take
a
parting
glass
sir
replied
the
coxswain
be
here
directly
i
hope
so
but
i
afraid
not
after
this
i
refused
all
the
solicitations
of
the
men
to
be
allowed
to
leave
the
boat
but
i
permitted
them
to
have
some
beer
brought
down
to
them
the
steward
then
came
back
with
a
basket
of
loaves
of
bread
and
told
me
that
the
marine
officer
requested
i
would
allow
two
of
the
men
to
go
up
with
him
to
glencross
shop
to
bring
down
some
of
the
stores
of
course
i
sent
two
of
the
men
and
told
the
steward
if
he
saw
hickman
to
bring
him
down
to
the
boat
by
this
time
many
of
the
women
belonging
to
the
ship
had
assembled
and
commenced
a
noisy
conversation
with
the
boat
crew
one
brought
an
article
for
jim
another
some
clothes
for
bill
some
of
them
climbed
into
the
boat
and
sat
with
the
men
others
came
and
went
bringing
beer
and
tobacco
which
the
men
desired
them
to
purchase
the
crowd
the
noise
and
confusion
were
so
great
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
i
could
keep
my
eyes
on
all
my
men
who
one
after
another
made
an
attempt
to
leave
the
boat
just
at
that
time
came
down
the
sergeant
of
the
marines
with
three
of
our
men
whom
he
had
picked
up
they
were
tumbled
into
the
boat
and
increased
the
difficulty
as
in
looking
after
those
who
were
riotous
and
would
try
to
leave
the
boat
by
force
i
was
not
so
well
able
to
keep
my
eyes
on
those
who
were
sober
the
sergeant
then
went
up
after
another
man
and
i
told
him
also
about
hickman
about
half
an
hour
afterwards
the
steward
came
down
with
the
two
men
loaded
with
cabbages
baskets
of
eggs
strings
of
onions
crockery
of
all
descriptions
paper
parcels
of
groceries
legs
and
shoulders
of
mutton
which
were
crowded
in
until
not
only
the
but
all
under
the
thwarts
of
the
boat
were
also
crammed
full
they
told
me
that
they
had
a
few
more
things
to
bring
down
and
that
the
marine
officer
had
gone
to
stonehouse
to
see
his
wife
so
that
they
should
be
down
long
before
him
in
half
an
hour
more
during
which
i
had
the
greatest
difficulty
to
manage
the
boat
crew
they
returned
with
a
dozen
geese
and
two
ducks
tied
by
the
legs
but
without
the
two
men
who
had
given
them
the
slip
so
that
there
were
now
three
men
gone
and
i
knew
mr
falcon
would
be
very
angry
for
they
were
three
of
the
smartest
men
in
the
ship
i
was
now
determined
not
to
run
the
risk
of
losing
more
men
and
i
ordered
the
boat
crew
to
shove
off
that
i
might
lie
at
the
wharf
where
they
could
not
climb
up
they
were
very
mutinous
grumbled
very
much
and
would
hardly
obey
me
the
fact
is
they
had
drunk
a
great
deal
and
some
of
them
were
more
than
half
tipsy
however
at
last
i
was
obeyed
but
not
without
being
saluted
with
a
shower
of
invectives
from
the
women
and
the
execrations
of
the
men
belonging
to
the
wherries
and
boats
which
were
washed
against
our
sides
by
the
swell
the
weather
had
become
much
worse
and
looked
very
threatening
i
waited
an
hour
more
when
the
sergeant
of
marines
came
down
with
two
more
men
one
of
whom
to
my
great
joy
was
hickman
this
made
me
more
comfortable
as
i
was
not
answerable
for
the
other
two
still
i
was
in
great
trouble
from
the
riotous
and
insolent
behaviour
of
the
boat
crew
and
the
other
men
brought
down
by
the
sergeant
of
marines
one
of
them
fell
back
into
a
basket
of
eggs
and
smashed
them
all
to
atoms
still
the
marine
officer
did
not
come
down
and
it
was
getting
late
the
tide
being
now
at
the
ebb
running
out
against
the
wind
there
was
a
heavy
sea
and
i
had
to
go
off
to
the
ship
with
a
boat
deeply
laden
and
most
of
the
people
in
her
in
a
state
of
intoxication
the
coxswain
who
was
the
only
one
who
was
sober
recommended
our
shoving
off
as
it
would
soon
be
dark
and
some
accident
would
happen
i
reflected
a
minute
and
agreeing
with
him
i
ordered
the
oars
to
be
got
out
and
we
shoved
off
the
sergeant
of
marines
and
the
steward
perched
up
in
the
bows
drunken
men
ducks
and
geese
lying
together
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
stern
sheets
loaded
up
to
the
gunwale
and
the
other
passengers
and
myself
sitting
how
we
could
among
the
crockery
and
a
variety
of
other
articles
with
which
the
boat
was
crowded
it
was
a
scene
of
much
confusion
the
crew
and
falling
forward
upon
the
others
those
who
were
quite
drunk
swearing
they
pull
lay
on
your
oar
sullivan
you
are
doing
more
harm
than
good
you
drunken
rascal
i
report
you
as
soon
as
we
get
on
board
how
the
divil
can
i
pull
your
honour
when
there
that
fellow
jones
breaking
the
very
back
o
me
with
his
oar
and
he
never
touching
the
water
all
the
while
you
lie
cried
jones
i
pulling
the
boat
by
myself
against
the
whole
of
the
larbard
oars
he
rowing
your
honour
only
making
bilave
do
you
call
this
rowing
dry
cried
another
as
a
sea
swept
over
the
boat
fore
and
aft
wetting
everybody
to
the
skin
now
your
honour
just
look
and
see
if
i
ai
pulling
the
very
arms
off
me
cried
sullivan
is
there
water
enough
to
cross
the
bridge
swinburne
said
i
to
the
coxswain
plenty
mr
simple
it
is
but
quarter
ebb
and
the
sooner
we
are
on
board
the
better
we
were
now
past
devil
point
and
the
sea
was
very
heavy
the
boat
plunged
in
the
trough
so
that
i
was
afraid
that
she
would
break
her
back
she
was
soon
half
full
of
water
and
the
two
were
laid
in
for
the
men
to
bale
plase
your
honour
had
i
better
cut
free
the
legs
of
them
ducks
and
geese
and
allow
them
to
swim
for
their
lives
cried
sullivan
resting
on
his
oar
the
poor
birds
will
be
drowned
else
in
their
own
no
no
pull
away
as
hard
as
you
can
by
this
time
the
drunken
men
in
the
bottom
of
the
boat
began
to
be
very
uneasy
from
the
quantity
of
water
which
washed
about
them
and
made
several
staggering
attempts
to
get
on
their
legs
they
fell
down
again
upon
the
ducks
and
geese
the
major
part
of
which
were
saved
from
being
drowned
by
being
suffocated
the
sea
on
the
bridge
was
very
heavy
and
although
the
tide
swept
us
out
we
were
nearly
swamped
soft
bread
was
washing
about
the
bottom
of
the
boat
the
parcels
of
sugar
pepper
and
salt
were
wet
through
with
the
salt
water
and
a
sudden
jerk
threw
the
captain
steward
who
was
seated
upon
the
gunwale
close
to
the
right
upon
the
whole
of
the
crockery
and
eggs
which
added
to
the
mass
of
destruction
a
few
more
seas
shipped
completed
the
job
and
the
steward
was
in
despair
that
a
darling
cried
sullivan
the
politest
boat
in
the
whole
fleet
she
makes
more
bows
and
curtseys
than
the
finest
couple
in
the
land
give
way
my
lads
and
work
the
crater
stuff
out
of
your
elbows
and
the
first
lieutenant
will
see
us
all
so
sober
and
so
wet
in
the
bargain
and
think
we
all
so
dry
that
perhaps
he
be
after
giving
us
a
raw
nip
when
we
get
on
board
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
were
nearly
alongside
but
the
men
pulled
so
badly
and
the
sea
was
so
great
that
we
missed
the
ship
and
went
astern
they
veered
out
a
buoy
with
a
line
which
we
got
hold
of
and
were
hauled
up
by
the
marines
and
the
boat
plunging
bows
under
and
drenching
us
through
and
through
at
last
we
got
under
the
counter
and
i
climbed
up
by
the
stern
ladder
mr
falcon
was
on
deck
and
very
angry
at
the
boat
not
coming
alongside
properly
i
thought
mr
simple
that
you
knew
by
this
time
how
to
bring
a
boat
alongside
so
i
do
sir
i
hope
replied
i
but
the
boat
was
so
full
of
water
and
the
men
would
not
give
way
what
men
has
the
sergeant
brought
on
board
three
sir
replied
i
shivering
with
the
cold
and
unhappy
at
my
very
best
uniform
being
spoiled
are
all
your
boat
crew
with
you
sir
no
sir
there
are
two
left
on
shore
they
not
a
word
sir
up
to
the
and
stay
there
till
i
call
you
down
if
it
were
not
so
late
i
would
send
you
on
shore
and
not
receive
you
on
board
again
without
the
men
up
sir
immediately
i
did
not
venture
to
explain
but
up
i
went
it
was
very
cold
blowing
hard
from
the
with
heavy
squalls
i
was
so
wet
that
the
wind
appeared
to
blow
through
me
and
it
was
now
nearly
dark
i
reached
the
and
when
i
was
seated
there
i
felt
that
i
had
done
my
duty
and
had
not
been
fairly
treated
during
this
time
the
boat
had
been
hauled
up
alongside
to
clear
and
a
pretty
clearance
there
was
all
the
ducks
and
geese
were
dead
the
eggs
and
crockery
all
broke
the
grocery
almost
all
washed
away
in
short
as
observed
there
was
a
very
pretty
general
average
mr
falcon
was
still
very
angry
who
are
the
men
missing
inquired
he
of
swinburne
the
coxswain
as
he
came
up
the
side
williams
and
sweetman
sir
two
of
the
smartest
topmen
i
am
told
it
really
is
too
provoking
there
is
not
a
midshipman
in
the
ship
i
can
trust
i
must
work
all
day
and
get
no
assistance
the
service
is
really
going
to
the
devil
now
with
the
young
men
who
are
sent
on
board
to
be
brought
up
as
officers
and
who
are
above
doing
their
duty
what
made
you
so
late
swinburne
waiting
for
the
marine
officer
who
went
to
stonehouse
to
see
his
wife
but
mr
simple
would
not
wait
any
longer
as
it
was
getting
dark
and
we
had
so
many
drunken
men
in
the
boat
mr
simple
did
right
i
wish
mr
harrison
would
stay
on
shore
with
his
wife
altogether
it
really
trifling
with
the
service
pray
mr
swinburne
why
had
you
not
your
eyes
about
you
if
mr
simple
was
so
careless
how
came
you
to
allow
these
men
to
leave
the
boat
the
men
were
ordered
up
by
the
marine
officer
to
bring
down
your
stores
sir
and
they
gave
the
steward
the
slip
it
was
no
fault
of
mr
simple
nor
of
mine
either
we
lay
off
at
the
wharf
for
two
hours
before
we
started
or
we
should
have
lost
more
for
what
can
a
poor
lad
do
when
he
has
charge
of
drunken
men
who
obey
orders
and
the
coxswain
looked
up
at
the
as
much
as
to
say
why
is
he
sent
there
i
take
my
oath
sir
continued
swinburne
that
mr
simple
never
put
his
foot
out
of
the
boat
from
the
time
that
he
went
over
the
side
until
he
came
on
board
and
that
no
young
gentleman
could
have
done
his
duty
more
strictly
mr
falcon
looked
very
angry
at
first
at
the
coxswain
speaking
so
freely
but
he
said
nothing
he
took
one
or
two
turns
on
the
deck
and
then
hailing
the
desired
me
to
come
down
but
i
my
limbs
were
so
cramped
with
the
wind
blowing
upon
my
wet
clothes
that
i
could
not
move
he
hailed
again
i
heard
him
but
was
not
able
to
answer
one
of
the
topmen
then
came
up
and
perceiving
my
condition
hailed
the
deck
and
said
he
believed
i
was
dying
for
i
could
not
move
and
that
he
dared
not
leave
me
for
fear
i
should
fall
who
had
been
on
deck
all
the
while
jumped
up
the
rigging
and
was
soon
at
the
where
i
was
he
sent
the
topman
down
into
the
top
for
a
and
the
haulyards
made
a
whip
and
lowered
me
on
deck
i
was
immediately
put
into
my
hammock
and
the
surgeon
ordering
me
some
hot
and
plenty
of
blankets
in
a
few
hours
i
was
quite
restored
who
was
at
my
bedside
said
never
mind
peter
and
do
be
angry
with
mr
falcon
for
he
is
very
sorry
i
am
not
angry
for
mr
falcon
has
been
too
kind
to
me
not
to
make
me
forgive
him
for
being
once
hasty
the
surgeon
came
to
my
hammock
gave
me
some
more
hot
drink
desired
me
to
go
to
sleep
and
i
woke
the
next
morning
quite
well
when
i
came
into
the
berth
my
messmates
asked
me
how
i
was
and
many
of
them
railed
against
the
tyranny
of
mr
falcon
but
i
took
his
part
saying
that
he
was
hasty
in
this
instance
perhaps
but
that
generally
speaking
he
was
an
excellent
and
very
just
officer
some
agreed
with
me
but
others
did
not
one
of
them
who
was
always
in
disgrace
sneered
at
me
and
said
peter
reads
the
bible
and
knows
that
if
you
smite
one
cheek
he
must
offer
the
other
now
i
answer
for
it
if
i
pull
his
right
ear
he
will
offer
me
his
left
so
saying
he
lugged
me
by
the
ear
upon
which
i
knocked
him
down
for
his
trouble
the
berth
was
then
cleared
away
for
a
fight
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
my
opponent
gave
in
but
i
suffered
a
little
and
had
a
very
black
eye
i
had
hardly
time
to
wash
myself
and
change
my
shirt
which
was
bloody
when
i
was
summoned
on
the
when
i
arrived
i
found
mr
falcon
walking
up
and
down
he
looked
very
hard
at
me
but
did
not
ask
me
any
questions
as
to
the
cause
of
my
unusual
appearance
mr
simple
said
he
i
sent
for
you
to
beg
your
pardon
for
my
behaviour
to
you
last
night
which
was
not
only
very
hasty
but
very
unjust
i
find
that
you
were
not
to
blame
for
the
loss
of
the
men
i
felt
very
sorry
for
him
when
i
heard
him
speak
so
handsomely
and
to
make
his
mind
more
easy
i
told
him
that
although
i
certainly
was
not
to
blame
for
the
loss
of
those
two
men
still
i
had
done
wrong
in
permitting
hickman
to
leave
the
boat
and
that
had
not
the
sergeant
picked
him
up
i
should
have
come
off
without
him
and
therefore
i
deserve
the
punishment
which
i
had
received
mr
simple
replied
mr
falcon
i
respect
you
and
admire
your
feelings
still
i
was
to
blame
and
it
is
my
duty
to
apologise
now
go
down
below
i
would
have
requested
the
pleasure
of
your
company
to
dinner
but
i
perceive
that
something
else
has
occurred
which
under
any
other
circumstances
i
would
have
inquired
into
but
at
present
i
shall
not
i
touched
my
hat
and
went
below
in
the
meantime
had
been
made
acquainted
with
the
occasion
of
the
quarrel
which
he
did
not
fail
to
explain
to
mr
falcon
who
declared
was
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
angry
with
me
for
what
had
occurred
indeed
after
that
mr
falcon
always
treated
me
with
the
greatest
kindness
and
employed
me
on
every
duty
which
he
considered
of
consequence
he
was
a
sincere
friend
for
he
did
not
allow
me
to
neglect
my
duty
but
at
the
same
time
treated
me
with
consideration
and
confidence
the
marine
officer
came
on
board
very
angry
at
being
left
behind
and
talked
about
a
on
me
for
disrespect
and
neglect
of
stores
entrusted
to
my
charge
but
told
me
not
to
mind
him
or
what
he
said
it
my
opinion
peter
that
the
gentleman
has
eaten
no
small
quantity
of
in
his
lifetime
what
that
replied
i
i
never
heard
of
it
why
peter
rejoined
he
it
the
stuff
they
fools
chapter
xxix
a
long
conversation
with
mr
chucks
the
advantage
of
having
a
in
your
pocket
we
run
down
the
trades
swinburne
the
quartermaster
and
his
yarns
the
captain
falls
sick
the
next
day
the
captain
came
on
board
with
sealed
orders
with
directions
not
to
open
them
until
off
ushant
in
the
afternoon
we
weighed
and
made
sail
it
was
a
fine
northerly
wind
and
the
bay
of
biscay
was
smooth
we
bore
up
set
all
the
and
ran
along
at
the
rate
of
eleven
miles
an
hour
as
i
could
not
appear
on
the
i
was
put
down
on
the
captain
savage
who
was
very
particular
asked
what
was
the
matter
with
me
the
surgeon
replied
an
inflamed
eye
the
captain
asked
no
more
questions
and
i
took
care
to
keep
out
of
his
way
i
walked
in
the
evening
on
the
forecastle
when
i
renewed
my
intimacy
with
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
to
whom
i
gave
a
full
narrative
of
all
my
adventures
in
france
i
have
been
ruminating
mr
simple
said
he
how
such
a
stripling
as
you
could
have
gone
through
so
much
fatigue
and
now
i
know
how
it
is
it
is
mr
simple
all
blood
you
are
descended
from
good
blood
and
there
as
much
difference
between
nobility
and
the
lower
classes
as
there
is
between
a
racer
and
a
i
can
not
agree
with
you
mr
chucks
common
people
are
quite
as
brave
as
those
who
are
you
do
not
mean
to
say
that
you
are
not
brave
that
the
seamen
on
board
this
ship
are
not
brave
no
no
mr
simple
but
as
i
observed
about
myself
my
mother
was
a
woman
who
could
not
be
trusted
and
there
is
no
saying
who
was
my
father
and
she
was
a
very
pretty
woman
to
boot
which
levels
all
distinctions
for
the
moment
as
for
the
seamen
god
knows
i
should
do
them
an
injustice
if
i
did
not
acknowledge
that
they
were
as
brave
as
lions
but
there
are
two
kinds
of
bravery
mr
simple
the
bravery
of
the
moment
and
the
courage
of
bearing
up
for
a
long
while
do
you
understand
me
i
think
i
do
but
still
do
not
agree
with
you
who
will
bear
more
fatigue
than
our
sailors
yes
yes
mr
simple
that
is
because
they
are
to
it
from
their
hard
life
but
if
the
common
sailors
were
all
such
little
as
you
and
had
been
brought
up
so
carefully
they
would
not
have
gone
through
all
you
have
that
my
opinion
mr
simple
there
nothing
like
i
think
mr
chucks
you
carry
your
ideas
on
that
subject
too
far
i
do
not
mr
simple
and
i
think
moreover
that
he
who
has
more
to
lose
than
another
will
always
strive
more
now
a
common
man
only
fights
for
his
own
credit
but
when
a
man
is
descended
from
a
long
line
of
people
famous
in
history
and
has
a
coat
arms
and
stuck
all
over
with
lions
and
unicorns
to
support
the
dignity
of
why
has
he
not
to
fight
for
the
credit
of
all
his
ancestors
whose
names
would
be
disgraced
if
he
did
behave
well
i
agree
with
you
mr
chucks
in
the
latter
remark
to
a
certain
extent
ah
mr
simple
we
never
know
the
value
of
good
descent
when
we
have
it
but
it
when
we
can
not
get
it
that
we
can
it
i
wish
i
had
been
born
a
nobleman
i
do
by
heavens
and
mr
chucks
slapped
his
fist
against
the
funnel
so
as
to
make
it
ring
again
well
mr
simple
continued
he
after
a
pause
it
is
however
a
great
comfort
to
me
that
i
have
parted
company
with
that
fool
mr
muddle
with
his
thousand
and
odd
years
and
that
old
woman
dispart
the
gunner
you
do
know
how
those
two
men
used
to
fret
me
it
was
very
silly
but
i
could
help
it
now
the
warrant
officers
of
this
ship
appear
to
be
very
respectable
quiet
men
who
know
their
duty
and
attend
to
it
and
are
not
too
familiar
which
i
hate
and
detest
you
went
home
to
your
friends
of
course
when
you
arrived
in
england
i
did
mr
chucks
and
spent
some
days
with
my
grandfather
lord
privilege
whom
you
say
you
once
met
at
dinner
well
and
how
was
the
old
gentleman
inquired
the
boatswain
with
a
sigh
very
well
considering
his
age
now
do
pray
mr
simple
tell
me
all
about
it
from
the
time
that
the
servants
met
you
at
the
door
until
you
went
away
describe
to
me
the
house
and
all
the
rooms
for
i
like
to
hear
of
all
these
things
although
i
can
never
see
them
again
to
please
mr
chucks
i
entered
into
a
full
detail
which
he
listened
to
very
attentively
until
it
was
late
and
then
with
difficulty
would
he
permit
me
to
leave
off
and
go
down
to
my
hammock
the
next
day
rather
a
singular
circumstance
occurred
one
of
the
midshipmen
was
by
the
second
lieutenant
for
not
waiting
on
deck
until
he
was
relieved
he
was
down
below
when
he
was
sent
for
and
expecting
to
be
punished
from
what
the
told
him
he
thrust
the
first
book
into
his
which
he
could
lay
his
hand
on
to
amuse
himself
at
the
and
then
ran
on
deck
as
he
surmised
he
was
immediately
ordered
aloft
he
had
not
been
there
more
than
five
minutes
when
a
sudden
squall
carried
away
the
mast
and
away
he
went
flying
over
to
leeward
for
the
wind
had
shifted
and
the
yards
were
now
braced
up
had
he
gone
overboard
as
he
could
not
swim
he
would
in
all
probability
have
been
drowned
but
the
book
in
his
pocket
brought
him
up
in
the
jaws
of
the
block
where
he
hung
until
taken
out
by
the
now
it
so
happened
that
it
was
a
which
he
had
laid
hold
of
in
his
hurry
and
those
who
were
superstitious
declared
it
was
all
owing
to
his
having
taken
a
religious
book
with
him
i
did
not
think
so
as
any
other
book
would
have
answered
the
purpose
quite
as
well
still
the
midshipman
himself
thought
so
and
it
was
productive
of
good
as
he
was
a
sad
scamp
and
behaved
much
better
afterwards
but
i
had
nearly
forgotten
to
mention
a
circumstance
which
occurred
on
the
day
of
our
sailing
which
will
be
eventually
found
to
have
had
a
great
influence
upon
my
after
life
it
was
this
i
received
a
letter
from
my
father
evidently
written
in
great
vexation
and
annoyance
informing
me
that
my
uncle
whose
wife
i
have
already
mentioned
had
two
daughters
and
was
again
expected
to
be
confined
had
suddenly
broken
up
his
housekeeping
discharged
every
servant
and
proceeded
to
ireland
under
an
assumed
name
no
reason
had
been
given
for
this
unaccountable
proceeding
and
not
even
my
grandfather
or
any
of
the
members
of
the
family
had
had
notice
of
his
intention
indeed
it
was
by
mere
accident
that
his
departure
was
discovered
about
a
fortnight
after
it
had
taken
place
my
father
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
pains
to
find
out
where
he
was
residing
but
although
my
uncle
was
traced
to
cork
from
that
town
all
clue
was
lost
but
still
it
was
supposed
from
inquiries
that
he
was
not
very
far
from
thence
now
observed
my
father
in
his
letter
i
can
not
help
surmising
that
my
brother
in
his
anxiety
to
retain
the
advantages
of
the
title
to
his
own
family
has
resolved
to
produce
to
the
world
a
spurious
child
as
his
own
by
some
contrivance
or
other
his
wife
health
is
very
bad
and
she
is
not
likely
to
have
a
large
family
should
the
one
now
expected
prove
a
daughter
there
is
little
chance
of
his
ever
having
another
and
i
have
no
hesitation
in
declaring
my
conviction
that
the
measure
has
been
taken
with
a
view
of
defrauding
you
of
your
chance
of
eventually
being
called
to
the
house
of
lords
i
showed
this
letter
to
who
after
reading
it
over
two
or
three
times
gave
his
opinion
that
my
father
was
right
in
his
conjectures
depend
upon
it
peter
there
foul
play
intended
that
is
if
foul
play
is
rendered
necessary
but
i
can
not
imagine
why
if
my
uncle
has
no
son
of
his
own
he
should
prefer
acknowledging
a
son
of
any
other
person
instead
of
his
own
nephew
but
i
can
peter
your
uncle
is
not
a
man
likely
to
live
very
long
as
you
know
the
doctors
say
that
with
his
short
neck
his
life
is
not
worth
two
years
purchase
now
if
he
had
a
son
consider
that
his
daughters
would
be
much
better
off
and
much
more
likely
to
get
married
besides
there
are
many
reasons
which
i
wo
talk
about
now
because
it
no
use
making
you
think
your
uncle
to
be
a
scoundrel
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
go
down
to
my
cabin
directly
and
write
to
father
telling
him
the
whole
affair
and
desiring
him
to
ferret
him
out
and
watch
him
narrowly
and
i
bet
you
a
dozen
of
claret
that
in
less
than
a
week
he
find
him
out
and
will
dog
him
to
the
last
get
hold
of
his
irish
servants
and
you
little
know
the
power
that
a
priest
has
in
our
country
now
give
the
description
as
well
as
you
can
of
your
uncle
appearance
also
of
that
of
his
wife
and
the
number
of
their
family
and
their
ages
father
must
have
all
particulars
and
then
let
him
alone
for
doing
what
is
needful
i
complied
with
directions
as
well
as
i
could
and
he
wrote
a
very
long
letter
to
father
which
was
sent
on
shore
by
a
careful
hand
i
answered
my
father
letter
and
then
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
our
sealed
orders
were
opened
and
proved
our
destination
to
be
the
west
indies
as
we
expected
we
touched
at
madeira
to
take
in
some
wine
for
the
ship
company
but
as
we
only
remained
one
day
we
were
not
permitted
to
go
on
shore
fortunate
indeed
would
it
have
been
if
we
had
never
gone
there
for
the
day
after
our
captain
who
had
dined
with
the
consul
was
taken
alarmingly
from
the
symptoms
the
surgeon
dreaded
that
he
had
been
poisoned
by
something
which
he
had
eaten
and
which
most
probably
had
been
cooked
in
a
copper
vessel
not
properly
tinned
we
were
all
very
anxious
that
he
should
recover
but
on
the
contrary
he
appeared
to
grow
worse
and
worse
every
day
wasting
away
and
dying
as
they
say
by
inches
at
last
he
was
put
into
his
cot
and
never
rose
from
it
again
this
melancholy
circumstance
added
to
the
knowledge
that
we
were
proceeding
to
an
unhealthy
climate
caused
a
gloom
throughout
the
ship
and
although
the
trade
wind
carried
us
along
bounding
over
the
bright
blue
sea
although
the
weather
was
now
warm
yet
not
too
warm
although
the
sun
rose
in
splendour
and
all
was
beautiful
and
cheering
the
state
of
the
captain
health
was
a
check
to
all
mirth
every
one
trod
the
deck
softly
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
all
were
anxious
to
have
the
morning
report
of
the
surgeon
and
our
conversation
was
generally
upon
the
sickly
climate
the
yellow
fever
of
death
and
the
palisades
where
they
buried
us
swinburne
the
was
in
my
watch
and
as
he
had
been
long
in
the
west
indies
i
used
to
obtain
all
the
information
from
him
that
i
could
the
old
fellow
had
a
secret
pleasure
in
frightening
me
as
much
as
he
could
really
mr
simple
you
ax
so
many
questions
he
would
say
as
i
accosted
him
while
he
was
at
his
station
at
the
i
wish
you
would
ax
so
many
questions
and
make
yourself
uncomfortable
so
it
is
with
regard
to
yellow
jack
as
we
calls
the
yellow
fever
it
a
devil
incarnate
that
sartain
you
well
and
able
to
take
your
allowance
in
the
morning
and
dead
as
a
herring
night
first
comes
a
bit
of
a
you
goes
to
the
doctor
who
bleeds
you
like
a
pig
then
you
go
out
of
your
senses
then
up
comes
the
black
vomit
and
then
it
all
over
with
you
and
you
go
to
the
land
crabs
who
pick
your
bones
as
clean
and
as
white
as
a
sea
tooth
but
there
be
one
thing
to
be
said
in
favour
of
yellow
jack
all
you
dies
like
a
gentleman
not
cribbled
up
like
a
chucked
out
on
the
ice
of
the
river
st
lawrence
with
your
knees
up
to
your
nose
or
your
toes
stuck
into
your
as
does
take
place
in
some
of
your
foreign
complaints
but
straight
quite
straight
and
limber
like
a
still
jack
is
a
little
mischievous
that
sartain
in
the
euridiscy
we
had
as
fine
a
company
as
was
ever
piped
aloft
starboard
my
man
off
your
course
we
dropped
our
anchor
in
port
royal
and
we
thought
that
there
was
mischief
brewing
for
sharks
followed
the
ship
into
the
harbour
and
played
about
us
day
and
night
i
used
to
watch
them
during
the
night
watch
as
their
fins
above
water
skimmed
along
leaving
a
trail
of
light
behind
them
and
the
second
night
i
said
to
the
sentry
abaft
as
i
was
looking
at
them
smelling
under
the
counter
says
i
sharks
are
mustering
under
the
orders
of
yellow
jack
and
i
no
sooner
mentioned
yellow
jack
than
the
sharks
gave
a
frisky
plunge
every
one
of
them
as
much
as
to
say
so
we
are
d
n
your
eyes
the
soldier
was
so
frightened
that
he
would
have
fallen
overboard
if
i
had
caught
him
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
for
he
was
standing
on
the
top
of
the
taffrail
as
it
was
he
dropped
his
musket
over
the
stern
which
the
sharks
dashed
at
from
every
quarter
making
the
sea
look
like
fire
and
he
had
it
charged
to
his
wages
i
think
however
the
fate
of
his
musket
gave
him
an
idea
of
what
would
have
happened
to
him
if
he
had
fallen
in
instead
of
it
and
he
never
got
on
the
taffrail
again
port
mind
your
helm
smith
you
can
listen
to
my
yarn
all
the
same
well
mr
simple
yellow
jack
came
sure
enough
first
the
purser
was
called
to
account
for
all
his
roguery
we
did
care
much
about
the
land
crabs
eating
him
who
had
made
so
many
poor
dead
men
chew
tobacco
cheating
their
wives
and
relations
or
greenwich
hospital
as
it
might
happen
then
went
two
of
the
middies
just
about
your
age
mr
simple
they
poor
fellows
went
off
in
a
sad
hurry
then
went
the
master
and
so
it
went
on
till
at
last
we
had
no
more
nor
sixty
men
left
in
the
ship
the
captain
died
last
and
then
yellow
jack
had
filled
his
maw
and
left
the
rest
of
us
alone
as
soon
as
the
captain
died
all
the
sharks
left
the
ship
and
we
never
saw
any
more
of
them
such
were
the
yarns
told
to
me
and
the
other
midshipmen
during
the
night
watches
and
i
can
assure
the
reader
that
they
gave
us
no
small
alarm
every
day
that
we
worked
our
day
work
and
found
ourselves
so
much
nearer
to
the
islands
did
we
feel
as
if
we
were
so
much
nearer
to
our
graves
i
once
spoke
to
about
it
and
he
laughed
peter
says
he
fear
kills
more
people
than
the
yellow
fever
or
any
other
complaint
in
the
west
indies
swinburne
is
an
old
rogue
and
only
laughing
at
you
the
devil
not
half
so
black
as
he
painted
nor
the
yellow
fever
half
so
yellow
i
presume
we
were
now
fast
nearing
the
island
of
barbadoes
the
weather
was
beautiful
the
wind
always
fair
the
flying
fish
rose
in
shoals
startled
by
the
foaming
seas
which
rolled
away
and
roared
from
the
bows
as
our
swift
frigate
cleaved
through
the
water
the
porpoises
played
about
us
in
thousands
the
bonetas
and
dolphins
at
one
time
chased
the
flying
fish
and
at
others
appeared
to
be
delighted
in
keeping
company
with
the
rapid
vessel
everything
was
beautiful
and
we
all
should
have
been
happy
had
it
not
been
for
the
state
of
captain
savage
in
the
first
place
who
daily
became
worse
and
worse
and
from
the
dread
of
the
hell
which
we
were
about
to
enter
through
such
a
watery
paradise
mr
falcon
who
was
in
command
was
grave
and
thoughtful
he
appeared
indeed
to
be
quite
miserable
at
the
chance
which
would
insure
his
own
promotion
in
every
attention
and
every
care
that
could
be
taken
to
insure
quiet
and
afford
relief
to
the
captain
he
was
unremitting
the
offence
of
making
a
noise
was
now
with
him
a
greater
crime
than
drunkenness
or
even
mutiny
when
within
three
days
sail
of
barbadoes
it
fell
almost
calm
and
the
captain
became
much
worse
and
now
for
the
first
time
did
we
behold
the
great
white
shark
of
the
atlantic
there
are
several
kinds
of
sharks
but
the
most
dangerous
are
the
great
white
shark
and
the
ground
shark
the
former
grows
to
an
enormous
length
the
latter
is
seldom
very
long
not
more
than
twelve
feet
but
spreads
to
a
great
breadth
we
could
not
hook
the
sharks
as
they
played
around
us
for
mr
falcon
would
not
permit
it
lest
the
noise
of
hauling
them
on
board
should
disturb
the
captain
a
breeze
again
sprang
up
in
two
days
we
were
close
to
the
island
and
the
men
were
desired
to
look
out
for
the
land
chapter
xxx
death
of
captain
savage
his
funeral
specimen
of
true
barbadian
born
sucking
the
monkey
effects
of
a
hurricane
the
next
morning
having
part
of
the
night
land
was
discovered
on
the
bow
and
was
reported
by
the
man
at
the
same
moment
that
the
surgeon
came
up
and
announced
the
death
of
our
noble
captain
although
it
had
been
expected
for
the
last
two
or
three
days
the
intelligence
created
a
heavy
gloom
throughout
the
ship
the
men
worked
in
silence
and
spoke
to
one
another
in
whispers
mr
falcon
was
deeply
affected
and
so
were
we
all
in
the
course
of
the
morning
we
ran
in
to
the
island
and
unhappy
as
i
was
i
never
can
forget
the
sensation
of
admiration
which
i
felt
on
closing
with
needham
point
to
enter
carlisle
bay
the
beach
of
such
a
pure
dazzling
white
backed
by
the
tall
green
trees
waving
their
spreading
heads
to
the
fresh
breeze
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
deeper
blue
of
the
transparent
sea
occasionally
varied
into
green
as
we
passed
by
the
coral
rocks
which
threw
their
branches
out
from
the
bottom
the
town
opening
to
our
view
by
degrees
houses
after
houses
so
neat
with
their
green
jalousies
dotting
the
landscape
the
fort
with
the
colours
flying
troops
of
officers
riding
down
a
busy
population
of
all
colours
relieved
by
the
whiteness
of
their
dress
altogether
the
scene
realised
my
first
ideas
of
fairyland
for
i
thought
i
had
never
witnessed
anything
so
beautiful
and
can
this
be
such
a
dreadful
place
as
it
is
described
thought
i
the
sails
were
clewed
up
the
anchor
was
dropped
to
the
bottom
and
a
salute
from
the
ship
answered
by
the
forts
added
to
the
effect
of
the
scene
the
sails
were
furled
the
boats
lowered
down
the
boatswain
squared
the
yards
from
the
ahead
mr
falcon
dressed
and
his
boat
being
manned
went
on
shore
with
the
despatches
then
as
soon
as
the
work
was
over
a
new
scene
of
delight
presented
itself
to
the
sight
of
midshipmen
who
had
been
so
long
upon
his
majesty
allowance
these
were
the
boats
which
crowded
round
the
ship
loaded
with
baskets
of
bananas
oranges
shaddocks
soursops
and
every
other
kind
of
tropical
fruit
fried
flying
fish
eggs
fowls
milk
and
everything
which
could
tempt
a
poor
boy
after
a
long
sea
voyage
the
watch
being
called
down
we
all
hastened
into
the
boats
and
returned
loaded
with
treasures
which
we
soon
contrived
to
make
disappear
after
stowing
away
as
much
fruit
as
would
have
sufficed
for
a
dessert
to
a
dinner
given
to
twenty
people
in
england
i
returned
on
deck
there
was
no
other
in
the
bay
but
my
attention
was
directed
to
a
beautiful
little
vessel
a
schooner
whose
fairy
form
contrasted
strongly
with
a
west
india
trader
which
lay
close
to
her
all
of
a
sudden
as
i
was
looking
at
her
beautiful
outline
a
yell
rose
from
her
which
quite
startled
me
and
immediately
afterwards
her
deck
was
covered
with
nearly
two
hundred
naked
figures
with
woolly
heads
chattering
and
grinning
at
each
other
she
was
a
spanish
slaver
which
had
been
captured
and
had
arrived
the
evening
before
the
slaves
were
still
on
board
waiting
the
orders
of
the
governor
they
had
been
on
deck
about
ten
minutes
when
three
or
four
men
with
large
panama
straw
hats
on
their
heads
and
long
rattans
in
their
hands
jumped
upon
the
gunnel
and
in
a
few
seconds
drove
them
all
down
below
i
then
turned
round
and
observed
a
black
woman
who
had
just
climbed
up
the
side
of
the
frigate
was
on
deck
and
she
walked
up
to
him
in
the
most
consequential
manner
how
do
you
do
sar
very
happy

said
she
to

inquired
i
a

massa
what

dem
four
shins
a
pictareen
our
deck
was
now
enlivened
by
several
army
officers
besides
gentlemen
residents
who
came
off
to
hear
the
news
invitations
to
the
mess
and
to
the
houses
of
the
gentlemen
followed
and
as
they
departed
mr
falcon
returned
on
board
he
told
and
the
other
officers
that
the
admiral
and
squadron
were
expected
in
a
few
days
and
that
we
were
to
remain
in
carlisle
bay
and
refit
immediately
but
although
the
fright
about
the
yellow
fever
had
considerably
subsided
in
our
breasts
the
remembrance
that
our
poor
captain
was
lying
dead
in
the
cabin
was
constantly
obtruding
all
that
night
the
carpenters
were
up
making
up
his
coffin
for
he
was
to
be
buried
the
next
day
the
body
is
never
allowed
to
remain
many
hours
unburied
in
the
tropical
climates
where
putrefaction
is
so
rapid
the
following
morning
the
men
were
up
at
daylight
washing
the
decks
and
putting
the
ship
in
order
they
worked
willingly
and
yet
with
a
silent
decorum
which
showed
what
their
feelings
were
never
were
the
decks
better
cleaned
never
were
the
ropes
more
carefully
down
the
hammocks
were
stowed
in
their
white
cloths
the
yards
carefully
squared
and
the
ropes
hauled
taut
at
eight
the
colours
and
pennant
were
hoisted
high
the
men
were
then
ordered
down
to
breakfast
and
to
clean
themselves
during
the
time
that
the
men
were
at
breakfast
all
the
officers
went
into
the
cabin
to
take
a
last
farewell
look
at
our
gallant
captain
he
appeared
to
have
died
without
pain
and
there
was
a
beautiful
tranquillity
in
his
face
but
even
already
a
change
had
taken
place
and
we
perceived
the
necessity
of
his
being
buried
so
soon
we
saw
him
placed
in
his
coffin
and
then
quitted
the
cabin
without
speaking
to
each
other
when
the
coffin
was
nailed
down
it
was
brought
up
by
the
barge
crew
to
the
and
laid
upon
the
gratings
amidships
covered
over
with
the
union
jack
the
men
came
up
from
below
without
waiting
for
the
pipe
and
a
solemnity
appeared
to
pervade
every
motion
order
and
quiet
were
universal
out
of
respect
to
the
deceased
when
the
boats
were
ordered
to
be
manned
the
men
almost
appeared
to
steal
into
them
the
barge
received
the
coffin
which
was
placed
in
the
stern
sheets
the
other
boats
then
hauled
up
and
received
the
officers
marines
and
sailors
who
were
to
follow
the
procession
when
all
was
ready
the
barge
was
shoved
off
by
the
the
crew
dropped
their
oars
into
the
water
without
a
splash
and
pulled
the
stroke
other
boats
followed
and
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
ship
the
minute
guns
boomed
along
the
smooth
surface
of
the
bay
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
ship
while
the
yards
were
topped
to
starboard
and
to
port
the
ropes
were
slackened
and
hung
in
bights
so
as
to
give
the
idea
of
distress
and
neglect
at
the
same
time
a
dozen
or
more
of
the
men
who
had
been
ready
dropped
over
the
sides
of
the
ship
in
differents
sic
parts
and
with
their
cans
of
paint
and
brushes
in
a
few
minutes
effaced
the
whole
of
the
broad
white
riband
which
marked
the
beautiful
run
of
the
frigate
and
left
her
all
black
and
in
deep
mourning
the
guns
from
the
forts
now
responded
to
our
own
the
merchant
ships
lowered
their
colours
and
the
men
stood
up
respectfully
with
their
hats
off
as
the
procession
moved
slowly
to
the
the
coffin
was
borne
to
the
by
the
crew
of
the
barge
followed
by
mr
falcon
as
chief
mourner
all
the
officers
of
the
ship
who
could
be
spared
one
hundred
of
the
seamen
walking
two
and
two
and
the
marines
with
their
arms
reversed
the
was
joined
by
the
army
officers
while
the
troops
lined
the
streets
and
the
bands
played
the
dead
march
the
service
was
read
the
volleys
were
fired
over
the
grave
and
with
oppressed
feelings
we
returned
to
the
boats
and
pulled
on
board
it
then
appeared
to
me
and
to
a
certain
degree
i
was
correct
that
as
soon
as
we
had
paid
our
last
respect
to
his
remains
we
had
also
forgotten
our
grief
the
yards
were
again
squared
the
ropes
hauled
taut
working
dresses
resumed
and
all
was
activity
and
bustle
the
fact
is
that
sailors
and
soldiers
have
no
time
for
lamentation
and
running
as
they
do
from
clime
to
clime
so
does
scene
follow
scene
in
the
same
variety
and
quickness
in
a
day
or
two
the
captain
appeared
to
be
although
he
was
not
forgotten
our
first
business
was
to
the
ship
by
rafting
and
towing
off
the
casks
i
was
in
charge
of
the
boat
again
with
swinburne
as
coxswain
as
we
pulled
in
there
were
a
number
of
negroes
bathing
in
the
surf
bobbing
their
woolly
heads
under
it
as
it
rolled
into
the
beach
now
mr
simple
said
swinburne
see
how
i
make
them
scamper
he
then
stood
up
in
the
stern
sheets
and
pointing
with
his
finger
roared
out
a
shark
a
shark
away
started
all
the
bathers
for
the
beach
puffing
and
blowing
from
their
dreaded
enemy
nor
did
they
stop
to
look
for
him
until
they
were
high
and
dry
out
of
his
reach
then
when
we
all
laughed
they
called
us
the
hangman
and
every
other
opprobrious
name
which
they
could
select
from
their
vocabulary
i
was
very
much
amused
with
this
scene
and
as
much
afterwards
with
the
negroes
who
crowded
round
us
when
we
landed
they
appeared
such
merry
fellows
always
laughing
chattering
singing
and
showing
their
white
teeth
one
fellow
danced
round
us
snapping
his
fingers
and
singing
songs
without
beginning
or
end

at

my
attention
was
directed
to
another
negro
who
lay
on
the
beach
rolling
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
apparently
in
a
fit

matter

that
fellow
said

he
snatched
the
stick
out
of
swinburne

and
running
up
to
the
man
who
continued
to
roll
on
the
beach
commenced
belabouring
him
without
mercy
eh
sambo
cried
he
at
last
quite
out
of
breath

no

yet

he
recommenced
until
at
last
the
man
got
up
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
he
could
now
whether
the
man
was
shamming
or
whether
it
was
real
or
epileptic
fit
i
know
not
but
i
never
heard
of
such
a
cure
for
it
before
i
threw
the
fellow
half
a
pictareen
as
much
for
the
amusement
he
had
afforded
me
as
to
get
rid
of
him
tanky
massa
now
man
here
de
tick
for
you
again
to
keep
off
all
the
dam
niggers
so
saying
he
handed
the
stick
to
swinburne
made
a
polite
bow
and
departed
we
were
however
soon
surrounded
by
others
particularly
some
dingy
ladies
with
baskets
of
fruit
and
who
as
they
said
sell
ebery
ting
i
perceived
that
my
sailors
were
very
fond
of
milk
which
being
a
harmless
beverage
i
did
not
object
to
their
purchasing
from
these
ladies
who
had
chiefly
in
their
baskets
as
i
had
never
tasted
it
i
asked
them
what
it
was
and
bought
a
i
selected
the
largest
no
massa
dat
not
good
for
you
better
one
for
buccra
officer
i
then
selected
another
but
the
same
objection
was
made
no
massa
dis
very
fine
milk
very
good
for
de
tomac
i
drank
off
the
milk
from
the
holes
on
the
top
of
the
and
found
it
very
refreshing
as
for
the
sailors
they
appeared
very
fond
of
it
indeed
but
i
very
soon
found
that
if
good
for
de
tomac
it
was
not
very
good
for
the
head
as
my
men
instead
of
rolling
the
casks
began
to
roll
themselves
in
all
directions
and
when
it
was
time
to
go
off
to
dinner
most
of
them
were
dead
drunk
at
the
bottom
of
the
boat
they
insisted
that
it
was
the
which
affected
them
very
hot
it
certainly
was
and
i
believed
them
at
first
when
they
were
only
giddy
but
i
was
convinced
to
the
contrary
when
i
found
that
they
became
insensible
yet
how
they
had
procured
the
liquor
was
to
me
a
mystery
when
i
came
on
board
mr
falcon
who
although
acting
captain
continued
his
duties
as
first
lieutenant
almost
as
punctually
as
before
asked
how
it
was
that
i
had
allowed
my
men
to
get
so
tipsy
i
assured
him
that
i
could
not
tell
that
i
had
never
allowed
one
to
leave
the
or
to
buy
any
liquor
the
only
thing
that
they
had
to
drink
was
a
little
milk
which
as
it
was
so
very
hot
i
thought
there
could
be
no
objection
to
mr
falcon
smiled
and
said
mr
simple
i
an
old
stager
in
the
west
indies
and
i
let
you
into
a
secret
do
you
know
what
the
means
no
sir
well
then
i
tell
you
it
is
a
term
used
among
seamen
for
drinking
out
of
milk
having
been
poured
out
and
the
liquor
substituted
now
do
you
comprehend
why
your
men
are
tipsy
i
stared
with
all
my
eyes
for
it
never
would
have
entered
into
my
head
and
i
then
perceived
why
it
was
that
the
black
woman
would
not
give
me
the
first
which
i
selected
i
told
mr
falcon
of
this
circumstance
who
replied
well
it
was
not
your
fault
only
you
must
not
forget
it
another
time
it
was
my
first
watch
that
night
and
swinburne
was
on
deck
swinburne
said
i
you
have
often
been
in
the
west
indies
before
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
the
men
were
the
when
i
thought
that
they
were
only
drinking
milk
swinburne
chuckled
and
answered
why
mr
simple
d
see
it
become
me
as
a
to
peach
it
but
seldom
that
a
poor
fellow
has
an
opportunity
of
making
himself
a
happy
and
it
would
not
be
fair
to
take
away
the
chance
i
suppose
you
never
let
them
have
milk
again
no
that
i
will
not
but
i
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
they
can
find
in
getting
so
tipsy
it
merely
because
they
are
not
allowed
to
be
so
sir
that
the
whole
story
in
few
words
well
i
think
i
could
cure
them
if
i
were
permitted
to
try
i
should
like
to
hear
how
you
manage
that
mr
simple
why
i
would
oblige
a
man
to
drink
off
a
half
pint
of
liquor
and
then
put
him
by
himself
i
would
not
allow
him
companions
to
make
merry
with
so
as
to
make
a
pleasure
of
intoxication
i
would
then
wait
until
next
morning
when
he
was
sober
and
leave
him
alone
with
a
racking
headache
until
the
evening
when
i
would
give
him
another
dose
and
so
on
forcing
him
to
get
drunk
until
he
hated
the
smell
of
liquor
well
mr
simple
it
might
do
with
some
but
many
of
our
chaps
would
require
the
dose
you
mention
to
be
repeated
pretty
often
before
it
would
effect
a
cure
and
what
more
they
be
very
willing
patients
and
make
no
wry
faces
at
their
physic
well
that
might
be
but
it
would
cure
them
at
last
but
tell
me
swinburne
were
you
ever
in
a
hurricane
i
been
in
everything
mr
simple
i
believe
except
at
school
and
i
never
had
no
time
to
go
there
do
you
see
that
battery
at
needham
point
well
in
the
hurricane
of
them
same
guns
were
whirled
away
by
the
wind
right
over
to
this
point
here
on
the
opposite
side
the
sentries
in
their
after
them
some
of
the
soldiers
who
faced
the
wind
had
their
teeth
blown
down
their
throats
like
broken
others
had
their
heads
turned
round
like
dog
vanes
they
waited
for
orders
to
the
about
and
the
whole
air
was
full
of
young
blowing
about
like
peelings
of
you
do
suppose
i
believe
all
this
swinburne
that
as
may
be
mr
simple
but
i
told
the
story
so
often
that
i
believe
it
myself
what
ship
were
you
in
in
the
captain
faulkner
who
was
as
fine
a
fellow
as
poor
captain
savage
whom
we
buried
yesterday
there
could
not
be
a
finer
than
either
of
them
i
was
at
the
taking
of
the
pique
and
carried
him
down
below
after
he
had
received
his
mortal
wound
we
did
a
pretty
thing
out
here
when
we
took
fort
royal
by
a
which
means
boarding
from
the
of
the
frigate
and
dropping
from
it
into
the
fort
but
what
that
under
the
moon
there
a
sail
in
the
offing
swinburne
fetched
the
glass
and
directed
it
to
the
spot
one
two
three
four
it
the
admiral
sir
and
the
squadron
for
the
night
one
a
ship
i
swear
i
examined
the
vessels
and
agreeing
with
swinburne
reported
them
to
mr
falcon
my
watch
was
then
over
and
as
soon
as
i
was
released
i
went

captain
kearney
the
dignity
ball
the
next
morning
at
daylight
we
exchanged
numbers
and
saluted
the
flag
and
by
eight
they
all
anchored
mr
falcon
went
on
board
the
admiral
ship
with
despatches
and
to
report
the
death
of
captain
savage
in
about
half
an
hour
he
returned
and
we
were
glad
to
perceive
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
from
which
we
argued
that
he
would
receive
his
acting
order
as
commander
which
was
a
question
of
some
doubt
as
the
admiral
had
the
power
to
give
the
vacancy
to
whom
he
pleased
although
it
would
not
have
been
fair
if
he
had
not
given
it
to
mr
falcon
not
that
mr
falcon
would
not
have
received
his
commission
as
captain
savage
dying
when
the
ship
was
under
no
admiral
command
he
but
still
the
admiral
might
have
sent
him
home
and
not
have
given
him
a
ship
but
this
he
did
the
captain
of
the
being
appointed
to
the
the
captain
of
the
to
the
and
captain
falcon
taking
command
of
the
he
received
his
commission
that
evening
and
the
next
day
the
exchanges
were
made
captain
falcon
would
have
taken
me
with
him
and
offered
so
to
do
but
i
could
not
leave
so
i
preferred
remaining
in
the
we
were
all
anxious
to
know
what
sort
of
a
person
our
new
captain
was
whose
name
was
kearney
but
we
had
no
time
to
ask
the
midshipmen
except
when
they
came
in
charge
of
the
boats
which
brought
his
luggage
they
replied
generally
that
he
was
a
very
good
sort
of
fellow
and
there
was
no
harm
in
him
but
when
i
had
the
night
watch
with
swinburne
he
came
up
to
me
and
said
well
mr
simple
so
we
have
a
new
captain
i
sailed
with
him
for
two
years
in
a
brig
and
pray
swinburne
what
sort
of
a
person
is
he
why
i
tell
you
mr
simple
he
a
kind
fellow
enough
but
but
what
such
a
how
do
you
mean
he
not
a
very
stout
man
bless
you
mr
simple
why
you
do
understand
english
i
mean
that
he
the
greatest
liar
that
ever
walked
a
deck
now
mr
simple
you
know
i
can
spin
a
yarn
occasionally
yes
that
you
can
witness
the
hurricane
the
other
night
well
mr
simple
i
can
not
a
to
him
it
that
i
might
not
stretch
now
and
then
just
for
fun
as
far
as
he
can
but
d
n
it
he
always
on
the
stretch
in
fact
mr
simple
he
never
tells
the
truth
except
he
as
poor
as
a
rat
and
has
nothing
but
his
pay
yet
to
believe
him
he
is
worth
at
least
as
much
as
greenwich
hospital
but
you
soon
find
him
out
and
he
sarve
to
laugh
at
behind
his
back
you
know
mr
simple
for
that
before
his
face
captain
kearney
made
his
appearance
on
board
the
next
day
the
men
were
mustered
to
receive
him
and
all
the
officers
were
on
the
you
a
fine
set
of
marines
here
captain
falcon
observed
he
those
i
left
on
board
of
the
were
only
fit
to
be
and
you
have
a
good
show
of
reefers
too
those
i
left
in
the
were
not
if
you
please
i
read
my
commission
if
you
order
the
men
aft
his
commission
was
read
all
hands
with
their
hats
off
from
respect
to
the
authority
from
which
it
proceeded
now
my
lads
said
captain
kearney
addressing
the
ship
company
i
but
few
words
to
say
to
you
i
am
appointed
to
command
this
ship
and
you
appear
to
have
a
very
good
character
from
your
late
first
lieutenant
all
i
request
of
you
is
this
be
smart
keep
sober
and
always
the
that
enough
pipe
down
gentlemen
continued
he
addressing
the
officers
i
trust
that
we
shall
be
good
friends
and
i
see
no
reason
that
it
should
be
otherwise
he
then
turned
away
with
a
bow
and
called
his
coxswain
williams
you
go
on
board
and
tell
my
steward
that
i
have
promised
to
dine
with
the
governor
and
that
he
must
come
to
dress
me
and
coxswain
recollect
to
put
the
sheepskin
mat
on
the
stern
gratings
of
my
gig
not
the
one
i
used
to
have
when
i
was
on
shore
in
my
but
the
blue
one
which
was
used
for
the
you
know
which
i
mean
i
happened
to
look
swinburne
in
the
face
who
cocked
his
eye
at
me
as
much
as
to
say
there
he
goes
we
afterwards
met
the
officers
of
the
who
corroborated
all
that
swinburne
had
said
although
it
was
quite
unnecessary
as
we
had
the
captain
own
words
every
minute
to
satisfy
us
of
the
fact
dinner
parties
were
now
very
numerous
and
the
hospitality
of
the
island
is
but
too
well
known
the
invitations
extended
to
the
midshipmen
and
many
was
the
good
dinner
and
kind
reception
which
i
had
during
my
stay
there
was
however
one
thing
i
had
heard
so
much
of
that
i
was
anxious
to
witness
it
which
was
a
but
i
must
enter
a
little
into
explanation
or
my
readers
will
not
understand
me
the
coloured
people
of
barbadoes
for
reasons
best
known
to
themselves
are
immoderately
proud
and
look
upon
all
the
negroes
who
are
born
on
other
islands
as
they
have
also
an
extraordinary
idea
of
their
own
bravery
although
i
never
heard
that
it
has
ever
been
put
to
the
proof
the
free
barbadians
are
most
of
them
very
rich
and
hold
up
their
heads
as
they
walk
with
an
air
quite
ridiculous
they
ape
the
manners
of
the
europeans
at
the
same
time
that
they
appear
to
consider
them
as
almost
their
inferiors
now
a
ball
is
a
ball
given
by
the
most
consequential
of
their
coloured
people
and
from
the
amusement
and
various
other
reasons
is
generally
well
attended
by
the
officers
both
on
shore
and
afloat
the
price
of
the
tickets
of
admission
was
high
i
think
they
were
half
a
joe
or
eight
dollars
each
the
governor
sent
out
cards
for
a
grand
ball
and
supper
for
the
ensuing
week
and
miss
betsy
austin
a
quadroon
woman
ascertaining
the
fact
sent
out
her
cards
for
the
same
evening
this
was
not
altogether
in
but
for
another
reason
which
was
that
she
was
aware
that
most
of
the
officers
and
midshipmen
of
the
ships
would
obtain
permission
to
go
to
the
governor
ball
and
preferring
hers
would
slip
away
and
join
the
party
by
which
means
she
ensured
a
full
attendance
on
the
day
of
invitation
our
captain
came
on
board
and
told
our
new
first
lieutenant
of
whom
i
shall
say
more
hereafter
that
the
governor
insisted
that
all
officers
should
go
that
he
would
take
no
denial
and
therefore
he
presumed
go
they
must
that
the
fact
was
that
the
governor
was
a
of
his
wife
and
under
some
trifling
obligations
to
him
in
obtaining
for
him
his
present
command
he
certainly
had
spoken
to
the
and
he
thought
it
not
impossible
considering
the
intimate
terms
which
the
minister
and
he
had
been
on
from
childhood
that
his
solicitation
might
have
had
some
effect
at
all
events
it
was
pleasant
to
find
that
there
was
some
little
gratitude
left
in
this
world
after
this
of
course
every
officer
went
with
the
exception
of
the
master
who
said
that
he
as
soon
have
two
round
turns
in
his
hawse
as
go
to
see
people
kick
their
legs
about
like
fools
and
that
he
take
care
of
the
ship
the
governor
ball
was
very
splendid
but
the
ladies
were
rather
sallow
from
the
effects
of
the
climate
however
there
were
exceptions
and
on
the
whole
it
was
a
very
gay
affair
but
we
were
all
anxious
to
go
to
the
ball
of
miss
betsy
austin
i
slipped
away
with
three
other
midshipmen
and
we
soon
arrived
there
a
crowd
of
negroes
were
outside
of
the
house
but
the
ball
had
not
yet
commenced
from
the
want
of
gentlemen
the
ball
being
very
correct
nothing
under
mulatto
in
colour
being
admitted
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
here
that
the
progeny
of
a
white
and
a
negro
is
a
mulatto
or
half
and
half
of
a
white
and
mulatto
a
or
black
and
of
this
class
the
company
were
chiefly
composed
i
believe
a
quadroon
and
white
make
the
or
black
and
the
mustee
and
white
the
mustafina
or
black
after
that
they
are
and
considered
as
europeans
the
pride
of
colour
is
very
great
in
the
west
indies
and
they
have
as
many
quarterings
as
a
german
prince
in
his
coat
of
arms
a
quadroon
looks
down
upon
a
mulatto
while
a
mulatto
looks
down
upon
a
that
is
half
mulatto
half
negro
while
a
sambo
in
his
turn
looks
down
upon
a
the
quadroons
are
certainly
the
handsomest
race
of
the
whole
some
of
the
women
are
really
beautiful
their
hair
is
long
and
perfectly
straight
their
eyes
large
and
black
their
figures
perfection
and
you
can
see
the
colour
mantle
in
their
cheeks
quite
as
plainly
and
with
as
much
effect
as
in
those
of
a
european
we
found
the
door
of
miss
austin
house
open
and
ornamented
with
orange
branches
and
on
our
presenting
ourselves
were
accosted
by
a
mulatto
gentleman
who
was
we
presumed
usher
of
the
black
rod
his
head
was
well
powdered
he
was
dressed
in
white
jean
trousers
a
waistcoat
not
six
inches
long
and
a
coat
on
as
a
livery
with
a
low
bow
he
took
de
liberty
to
trouble
de
gentlemen
for
de
card
for
de
ball
which
being
produced
we
were
ushered
on
by
him
to
the
at
the
door
of
which
miss
austin
was
waiting
to
receive
her
company
she
made
us
a
low
courtesy
observing
she
really
happy
to
see
de
of
de
ship
but
hoped
to
see
de
also
at
her
this
remark
touched
our
and
one
of
my
companions
replied
that
we
midshipmen
considered
ourselves
officers
and
no
ones
either
and
that
if
she
waited
for
the
lieutenants
she
must
wait
until
they
were
tired
of
the
governor
ball
we
having
given
the
preference
to
hers
this
remark
set
all
to
rights
sangaree
was
handed
about
and
i
looked
around
at
the
company
i
must
acknowledge
at
the
risk
of
losing
the
good
opinion
of
my
fair
countrywomen
that
i
never
saw
before
so
many
pretty
figures
and
faces
the
not
having
yet
arrived
we
received
all
the
attention
and
i
was
successively
presented
to
miss
eurydice
miss
minerva
miss
sylvia
miss
aspasia
miss
euterpe
and
many
others
evidently
borrowed
from
the
different
which
had
been
on
the
station
all
these
young
ladies
gave
themselves
all
the
airs
of
almack
their
dresses
i
can
not
pretend
to
describe
jewels
of
value
were
not
wanting
but
their
drapery
was
slight
they
appeared
neither
to
wear
nor
to
require
stays
and
on
the
whole
their
figures
were
so
perfect
that
they
could
only
be
ill
dressed
by
having
on
too
much
dress
a
few
more
midshipmen
and
some
lieutenants
among
the
number
having
made
their
appearance
miss
austin
directed
that
the
ball
should
commence
i
requested
the
honour
of
miss
eurydice
hand
in
a
cotillon
which
was
to
open
the
ball
at
this
moment
stepped
forth
the
premier
violin
master
of
the
ceremonies
and
massa
johnson
really
a
very
smart
man
who
gave
lessons
in
dancing
to
all
the
ladies
he
was
a
dark
quadroon
his
hair
slightly
powdered
dressed
in
a
light
blue
coat
thrown
well
back
to
show
his
waistcoat
only
one
button
of
which
he
could
afford
to
button
to
make
full
room
for
the
pride
of
his
heart
the
frill
of
his
shirt
which
really
was
jabot
four
inches
wide
and
extending
from
his
collar
to
the
waistband
of
his
nankeen
tights
which
were
finished
off
at
his
knees
with
huge
bunches
of
ribbon
his
legs
were
encased
in
silk
stockings
which
however
was
not
very
good
taste
on
his
part
as
they
showed
the
manifest
advantage
which
an
european
has
over
a
coloured
man
in
the
formation
of
the
leg
instead
of
being
straight
his
shins
curved
like
a
and
moreover
his
leg
was
planted
into
his
foot
like
the
handle
into
a
broom
or
there
being
quite
as
much
of
the
foot
on
the
heel
side
as
on
the
toe
side
such
was
the
appearance
of
mr
apollo
johnson
whom
the
ladies
considered
as
the
plus
ultra
fashion
and
the
his
or
was
his
wand
whose
magic
rap
on
the
fiddle
produced
immediate
obedience
to
his
mandates
ladies
and
gentle
take
your
seats
all
started
up
miss
eurydice
you
open
de
ball
miss
eurydice
had
but
a
sorry
partner
but
she
undertook
to
instruct
me
was
our
with
miss
euterpe
the
other
gentlemen
were
officers
from
the
ships
and
we
stood
up
twelve
checkered
brown
and
white
like
a
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
mr
apollo
johnson
who
first
looked
at
the
couples
then
at
his
fiddle
and
lastly
at
the
other
musicians
to
see
if
all
was
right
and
then
with
a
wave
of
his
the
music
began
massa
lieutenant
cried
apollo
to
cross
over
to
opposite
lady
right
hand
and
left
den
figure
to
miss
eurydice
dat
right
now
four
hand
round
you
lilly
midshipman
set
your
partner
sir
den
twist
her
round
dat
do
now
stop
first
figure
all
over
at
this
time
i
thought
i
might
venture
to
talk
a
little
with
my
partner
and
i
ventured
a
remark
to
my
surprise
she
answered
very
sharply
i
come
here
for
dance
sar
and
not
for
chatter
look
massa
johnson
he
tap
um
the
second
figure
commenced
and
i
made
a
sad
bungle
so
i
did
of
the
third
and
fourth
and
fifth
for
i
never
had
danced
a
cotillon
when
i
handed
my
partner
to
her
place
who
certainly
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
room
she
looked
rather
contemptuously
at
me
and
observed
to
a
neighbour
i
really
pity
de
gentleman
as
come
from
england
dat
no
know
how
to
dance
nor
nothing
at
all
until
em
hab
instruction
at
barbadoes
a
country
dance
was
now
called
for
which
was
more
acceptable
to
all
parties
as
none
of
mr
apollo
johnson
pupils
were
very
perfect
in
their
cotillon
and
none
of
the
officers
except
knew
anything
about
them
superior
education
on
this
point
added
to
his
lieutenant
epaulet
and
handsome
person
made
him
much
courted
but
he
took
up
with
miss
eurydice
after
i
had
left
her
and
remained
with
her
the
whole
evening
thereby
exciting
the
jealousy
of
mr
apollo
johnson
who
it
appears
was
amorous
in
that
direction
our
party
increased
every
minute
all
the
officers
of
the
garrison
and
finally
as
soon
as
they
could
get
away
the
governor
all
dressed
in
plain
clothes
the
dancing
continued
until
three
in
the
morning
when
it
was
quite
a
squeeze
from
the
constant
arrival
of
fresh
recruits
from
all
the
houses
of
barbadoes
i
must
say
that
a
few
bottles
of
eau
de
cologne
thrown
about
the
room
would
have
improved
the
atmosphere
by
this
time
the
heat
was
terrible
and
the
of
the
ladies
faces
everlasting
i
would
recommend
a
dignity
ball
to
all
stout
gentlemen
who
wish
to
be
reduced
a
stone
or
two
supper
was
now
announced
and
having
danced
the
last
country
dance
with
miss
minerva
i
of
course
had
the
pleasure
of
handing
her
into
the
it
was
my
fate
to
sit
opposite
to
a
fine
turkey
and
i
asked
my
partner
if
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
helping
her
to
a
piece
of
the
breast
she
looked
at
me
very
indignantly
and
said
curse
your
impudence
sar
i
wonder
where
you
larn
manners
sar
i
take
a
lilly
turkey
if
you
please
talk
of
to
a
lady
sar
really
quite
i
made
two
or
three
more
barbarous
mistakes
before
the
supper
was
finished
at
last
the
eating
was
over
and
i
must
say
a
better
supper
i
never
sat
down
to
silence
gentlemen
and
ladies
cried
mr
apollo
johnson
wid
the
permission
of
our
amiable
hostess
i
will
propose
a
toast
gentlemen
and
ladies
you
all
know
and
if
be
so

i
say
that

place

jealous
of
gentlemen
and
lady
barbadian
born
ab
only
one
fault
he
too
i
propose
health
of
of
barbadoes
acclamations
from
all
quarters
followed
this
truly
modest
speech
and
the
toast
was
drunk
with
rapture
the
ladies
were
delighted
with
mr
apollo
eloquence
and
the
lead
which
he
took
in
the
company
then
rose
and
addressed
the
company
as
follows
ladies
and
gentlemen
mr
poll
has
spoken
better
than
the
best
parrot
i
ever
met
with
in
this
country
but
as
he
has
thought
proper
to
drink
the
of
barbadoes
i
mean
to
be
a
little
more
particular
i
wish
with
him
all
good
health
to
the
island
but
there
is
a
charm
without
which
the
island
would
be
a
desert
that
is
the
society
of
the
lovely
girls
which
now
surround
us
and
take
our
hearts
by
storm
here
put
his
arm
gently
round
miss
eurydice
waist
and
mr
apollo
ground
his
teeth
so
as
to
be
heard
at
the
furthest
end
of
the
room
therefore
gentlemen
with
your
permission
i
will
propose
the
health
of
the
ladies
this
speech
of
was
declared
by
the
females
at
least
to
be
infinitely
superior
to
mr
apollo
johnson
miss
eurydice
was
even
more
gracious
and
the
other
ladies
were
more
envious
many
other
toasts
and
much
more
wine
was
drunk
until
the
male
part
of
the
company
appeared
to
be
rather
riotous
mr
apollo
however
had
to
regain
his
superiority
and
after
some
hems
and
hahs
begged
permission
to
give
a
sentiment
gentlemen
and
ladies
i
beg
then
to
say
here
to
de
cock
who
make
lub
to
de
hen
crow
till
he
hoarse
and
make
lub
again
this
was
received
with
rapture
and
after
silence
was
obtained
miss
betsy
austin
rose
and
said
unaccustomed
as
she
was
to
public
she
must
not
sit
and
not
tank
de
gentleman
for
his
very
fine
toast
and
in
de
name
of
de
ladies
she
begged
to
propose
another
sentimen
which
was
here
to
de
hen
what
nebber
refuses
let
cock
pay
compliment
whenebber
he
chooses
if
the
first
toast
was
received
with
applause
this
was
with
enthusiasm
but
we
received
a
damper
after
it
was
subsided
by
the
lady
of
the
house
getting
up
and
saying
now
gentlemen
and
ladies
me
tink
it
right
to
say
dat
it
time
to
go
home
i
nebber
allow
people
get
drunk
or
kick
up
bobbery
in
my
house
so
now
i
tink
we
better
take
and
very
much
obliged
to
you
for
your
company
as
said
this
was
a
broad
hint
to
be
off
so
we
all
now
took
our
in
compliance
with
her
request
and
our
own
wishes
and
proceeded
to
escort
our
partners
on
their
way
home
while
i
was
assisting
miss
minerva
to
her
red
crape
shawl
a
storm
was
brewing
in
another
quarter
to
wit
between
mr
apollo
johnson
and
was
assiduously
attending
to
miss
eurydice
whispering
what
he
called
soft
blarney
in
her
ear
when
mr
apollo
who
was
above
heat
with
jealousy
came
up
and
told
miss
eurydice
that
he
would
have
the
honour
of
escorting
her
home
you
may
save
yourself
the
trouble
you
dingy
replied
the
lady
is
under
my
protection
so
take
your
ugly
black
face
out
of
the
way
or
i
show
you
how
i
treat
a
who
is
really
too
brave
so
me
gad
massa
lieutenant
you
put
finger
on
me
i
show
you
what
can
do
apollo
then
attempted
to
insert
himself
between
and
his
lady
upon
which
shoved
him
back
with
great
violence
and
continued
his
course
towards
the
door
they
were
in
the
passage
when
i
came
up
for
hearing
voice
in
anger
i
left
miss
minerva
to
shift
for
herself
miss
eurydice
had
now
left
arm
at
his
request
and
he
and
mr
apollo
were
standing
in
the
passage
close
to
the
door
which
was
shut
and
apollo
swaggering
up
to
him
who
knew
the
tender
part
of
a
black
saluted
apollo
with
a
kick
on
the
shins
which
would
have
broken
my
leg
massa
johnson
roared
with
pain
and
recoiled
two
or
three
paces
parting
the
crowd
away
behind
him
the
blacks
never
fight
with
fists
but
butt
with
their
heads
like
rams
and
with
quite
as
much
force
when
mr
apollo
had
retreated
he
gave
his
shin
one
more
rub
uttered
a
loud
yell
and
started
at
with
his
head
aimed
at
chest
like
a
who
was
aware
of
this
plan
of
fighting
stepped
dexterously
on
one
side
and
allowed
mr
apollo
to
pass
by
him
which
he
did
with
such
force
that
his
head
went
clean
through
the
panel
of
the
door
behind
and
there
he
stuck
as
fast
as
if
in
a
pillory
squeaking
like
a
pig
for
assistance
and
foaming
with
rage
after
some
difficulty
he
was
released
and
presented
a
very
melancholy
figure
his
face
was
much
cut
and
his
superb
all
in
tatters
he
appeared
however
to
have
had
quite
enough
of
it
as
he
retreated
to
the
followed
by
some
of
his
admirers
without
asking
or
looking
after
but
if
mr
apollo
had
had
enough
of
it
his
friends
were
too
indignant
to
allow
us
to
go
off
scot
free
a
large
mob
was
collected
in
the
street
vowing
vengeance
on
us
for
our
treatment
of
their
flash
man
and
a
row
was
to
be
expected
miss
eurydice
had
escaped
so
that
had
his
hands
free
cam
out
you
hangman
tiefs
cam
out
only
wish
had
rock
stones
to
mash
your
heads
with
cried
the
mob
of
negroes
the
officers
now
sallied
out
in
a
body
and
were
saluted
with
every
variety
of
missile
such
as
rotten
oranges
mud
and
shells
we
fought
our
way
manfully
but
as
we
neared
the
beach
the
mob
increased
to
hundreds
and
at
last
we
could
proceed
no
further
being
completely
jammed
up
by
the
niggers
upon
whose
heads
we
could
make
no
more
impression
than
upon
blocks
of
marble
we
must
draw
our
swords
observed
an
officer
no
no
replied
that
will
not
do
if
once
we
shed
blood
they
will
never
let
us
get
on
board
with
our
lives
the
boat
crew
by
this
time
must
be
aware
that
there
is
a
row
was
right
he
had
hardly
spoken
before
a
lane
was
observed
to
be
made
through
the
crowd
in
the
distance
which
in
two
minutes
was
open
to
us
swinburne
appeared
in
the
middle
of
it
followed
by
the
rest
of
the
boat
crew
armed
with
the
boat
stretchers
which
they
did
not
aim
at
the
of
the
blacks
but
swept
them
like
scythes
against
their
this
they
continued
to
do
right
and
left
of
us
as
we
walked
through
and
went
down
to
the
boats
the
seamen
closing
up
the
rear
with
their
stretchers
with
which
they
ever
and
anon
made
a
sweep
at
the
black
fellows
if
they
approached
too
near
it
was
now
broad
daylight
and
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
again
safely
on
board
the
frigate
thus
ended
the
first
and
last
dignity
ball
that
i
attended
chapter
xxxii
i
am
claimed
by
captain
kearney
as
a
relation
trial
of
skill
between
first
lieutenant
and
captain
with
the
long
bow
the
shark
the
and
the
will
a
picture
as
the
admiral
was
not
one
who
would
permit
the
ships
under
his
command
to
lie
idle
in
port
in
a
very
few
days
after
the
dignity
ball
which
i
have
described
all
the
squadron
sailed
on
their
various
destinations
i
was
not
sorry
to
leave
the
bay
for
one
soon
becomes
tired
of
profusion
and
cared
nothing
for
either
oranges
bananas
or
shaddocks
nor
even
for
the
good
dinners
and
claret
at
the
tables
of
the
army
mess
and
gentlemen
of
the
island
the
sea
breeze
soon
became
more
precious
to
us
than
anything
else
and
if
we
could
have
bathed
without
the
fear
of
a
shark
we
should
have
equally
appreciated
that
most
refreshing
of
all
luxuries
under
the
torrid
zone
it
was
therefore
with
pleasure
that
we
received
the
information
that
we
were
to
sail
the
next
day
to
cruise
off
the
french
island
of
martinique
captain
kearney
had
been
so
much
on
shore
that
we
saw
but
little
of
him
and
the
ship
was
entirely
under
the
control
of
the
first
lieutenant
of
whom
i
have
hitherto
not
spoken
he
was
a
very
short
man
with
red
hair
and
whiskers
a
good
sailor
and
not
a
bad
officer
that
is
he
was
a
practical
sailor
and
could
show
any
foremast
man
his
duty
in
any
department
and
this
seamen
very
much
appreciate
as
it
is
not
very
common
but
i
never
yet
knew
an
officer
who
prided
himself
upon
his
practical
knowledge
who
was
at
the
same
time
a
good
navigator
and
too
often
by
assuming
the
jack
tar
they
lower
the
respect
due
to
them
and
become
coarse
and
vulgar
in
their
manners
and
language
this
was
the
case
with
mr
phillott
who
prided
himself
upon
his
slang
and
who
was
at
one
time
hail
fellow
well
met
with
the
seamen
talking
to
them
and
being
answered
as
familiarly
as
if
they
were
equals
and
at
another
knocking
the
very
same
men
down
with
a
handspike
if
he
was
displeased
he
was
not
but
very
hasty
and
his
language
to
the
officers
was
occasionally
very
incorrect
to
the
midshipmen
invariably
so
however
on
the
whole
he
was
not
disliked
although
he
was
certainly
not
respected
as
a
first
lieutenant
should
have
been
it
is
but
fair
to
say
that
he
was
the
same
to
his
superiors
as
he
was
to
his
inferiors
and
the
bluntness
with
which
he
used
to
contradict
and
assert
his
disbelief
of
captain
narratives
often
produced
a
coolness
between
them
for
some
days
the
day
after
we
sailed
from
carlisle
bay
i
was
asked
to
dine
in
the
cabin
the
dinner
was
served
upon
plated
dishes
which
looked
very
grand
but
there
was
not
much
in
them
this
plate
observed
the
captain
was
presented
to
me
by
some
merchants
for
my
exertions
in
saving
their
property
from
the
danes
when
i
was
cruising
off
heligoland
why
that
lying
steward
of
yours
told
me
that
you
bought
it
at
portsmouth
replied
the
first
lieutenant
i
asked
him
in
the
galley
this
morning
how
came
you
to
assert
such
a
confounded
falsehood
sir
said
the
captain
to
the
man
who
stood
behind
his
chair
i
only
said
that
i
thought
so
replied
the
steward
why
did
you
say
that
the
bill
had
been
sent
in
through
you
seven
or
eight
times
and
that
the
captain
had
paid
it
with
a
flowing
sheet
did
you
dare
say
that
sir
interrogated
the
captain
very
angrily
mr
phillott
mistook
me
sir
replied
the
steward
he
was
so
busy
damning
the
sweepers
that
he
did
not
hear
me
right
i
said
the
midshipmen
had
paid
their
crockery
bill
with
the
ay
ay
replied
the
captain
that
much
more
likely
well
mr
steward
replied
mr
phillott
i
be
d
d
if
you
as
big
a
liar
as
your
master
he
was
going
to
plump
out
but
fortunately
the
first
lieutenant
checked
himself
and
added
as
your
father
was
before
you
the
captain
changed
the
conversation
by
asking
me
whether
i
would
take
a
slice
of
ham
it
real
westphalia
mr
simple
i
have
them
sent
me
direct
by
count
troningsken
an
intimate
friend
of
mine
who
kills
his
own
wild
boars
in
the
hartz
mountains
how
the
devil
do
you
get
them
over
captain
kearney
there
are
ways
and
means
of
doing
everything
mr
phillott
and
the
first
consul
is
not
quite
so
bad
as
he
is
represented
the
first
batch
was
sent
over
with
a
very
handsome
letter
to
me
written
in
his
own
hand
which
i
will
show
you
some
of
these
days
i
wrote
to
him
in
return
and
sent
to
him
two
cheshire
cheeses
by
a
smuggler
and
since
that
they
came
regularly
did
you
ever
eat
westphalia
ham
mr
simple
yes
replied
i
once
i
partook
of
one
at
lord
privilege
lord
privilege
why
he
a
distant
relation
of
mine
a
sort
of
fifth
cousin
replied
captain
kearney
indeed
sir
replied
i
then
you
must
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
a
relation
captain
kearney
said
the
first
lieutenant
for
mr
simple
is
his
grandson
is
it
possible
i
can
only
say
mr
simple
that
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
show
you
every
attention
and
am
very
glad
that
i
have
you
as
one
of
my
officers
now
although
this
was
all
false
for
captain
kearney
was
not
in
the
remotest
manner
connected
with
my
family
yet
having
once
asserted
it
he
could
not
retract
and
the
consequence
was
that
i
was
much
the
gainer
by
his
falsehood
as
he
treated
me
very
kindly
afterwards
always
calling
me
the
first
lieutenant
smiled
and
gave
me
a
wink
when
the
captain
had
finished
his
speech
to
me
as
much
as
to
say
you
in
luck
and
then
the
conversation
changed
captain
kearney
certainly
dealt
in
the
marvellous
to
admiration
and
really
told
his
stories
with
such
earnestness
that
i
actually
believe
that
he
thought
he
was
telling
the
truth
never
was
there
such
an
instance
of
confirmed
habit
telling
a
story
of
a
expedition
he
said
the
french
captain
would
have
fallen
by
my
hand
but
just
as
i
levelled
my
musket
a
ball
came
and
cut
off
the
cock
of
the
lock
as
clean
as
if
it
was
done
with
a
knife
a
very
remarkable
instance
observed
he
not
equal
to
what
occurred
in
a
ship
i
was
in
replied
the
first
lieutenant
when
the
second
lieutenant
was
grazed
by
a
which
cut
off
one
of
his
whiskers
and
turning
round
his
head
to
ascertain
what
was
the
matter
another
came
and
took
off
the
other
now
that
what
i
call
a
yes
replied
captain
kearney
very
close
indeed
if
it
were
true
but
you
excuse
me
mr
phillott
but
you
sometimes
tell
strange
stories
i
do
not
mind
it
myself
but
the
example
is
not
good
to
my
young
relation
here
mr
simple
captain
kearney
replied
the
first
lieutenant
laughing
very
immoderately
do
you
know
what
the
pot
called
the
kettle
no
sir
i
do
not
retorted
the
captain
with
offended
dignity
mr
simple
will
you
take
a
glass
of
wine
i
thought
that
this
little
would
have
checked
the
captain
it
did
so
but
only
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
again
commenced
the
first
lieutenant
observed
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
let
water
into
the
ship
every
morning
and
pump
it
out
to
avoid
the
smell
of
the
there
are
worse
smells
than
replied
the
captain
what
do
you
think
of
a
whole
ship
company
being
nearly
poisoned
with
otto
of
roses
yet
that
occurred
to
me
when
in
the
mediterranean
i
was
off
smyrna
cruising
for
a
french
ship
that
was
to
sail
to
france
with
a
pasha
on
board
as
an
ambassador
i
knew
she
would
be
a
good
prize
and
was
looking
sharp
out
when
one
morning
we
discovered
her
on
the
lee
bow
we
made
all
sail
but
she
walked
away
from
us
bearing
away
gradually
till
we
were
both
before
the
wind
and
at
night
we
lost
sight
of
her
as
i
knew
that
she
was
bound
to
marseilles
i
made
all
sail
to
fall
in
with
her
again
the
wind
was
light
and
variable
but
five
days
afterwards
as
i
lay
in
my
cot
just
before
daylight
i
smelt
a
very
strong
smell
blowing
in
at
the
weather
port
and
coming
down
the
skylight
which
was
open
and
after
sniffing
at
it
two
or
three
times
i
knew
it
to
be
otto
of
roses
i
sent
for
the
officer
of
the
watch
and
asked
him
if
there
was
anything
in
sight
he
replied
there
was
not
and
i
ordered
him
to
sweep
the
horizon
with
his
glass
and
look
well
out
to
windward
as
the
wind
freshened
the
smell
became
more
powerful
i
ordered
him
to
get
the
royal
yards
across
and
all
ready
to
make
sail
for
i
knew
that
the
turk
must
be
near
us
at
daylight
there
he
was
just
three
miles
ahead
in
the
eye
but
although
he
beat
us
going
free
he
was
no
match
for
us
on
a
wind
and
before
noon
we
had
possession
of
him
and
all
his
harem
i
could
tell
you
a
good
story
about
the
ladies
she
was
a
very
valuable
prize
and
among
other
things
she
had
a
of
otto
of
roses
on
board
whew
cried
the
first
lieutenant
what
a
whole
puncheon
yes
replied
the
captain
a
turkish
puncheon
not
quite
so
large
perhaps
as
ours
on
board
their
weights
and
measures
are
different
i
took
out
most
of
the
valuables
into
the
brig
i
commanded
about
sequins
carpets
and
among
the
rest
this
cask
of
otto
of
roses
which
we
had
smelt
three
miles
off
we
had
it
safe
on
board
when
the
mate
of
the
hold
not
slinging
it
properly
it
fell
into
the
with
a
run
and
was
stove
to
pieces
never
was
such
a
scene
my
first
lieutenant
and
several
men
on
deck
fainted
and
the
men
in
the
hold
were
brought
up
lifeless
it
was
some
time
before
they
were
recovered
we
let
the
water
into
the
brig
and
pumped
it
out
but
nothing
would
take
away
the
smell
which
was
so
overpowering
that
before
i
could
get
to
malta
i
had
forty
men
on
the
sick
list
when
i
arrived
there
i
turned
the
mate
out
of
the
service
for
his
carelessness
it
was
not
until
after
having
smoked
the
brig
and
finding
that
of
little
use
after
having
sunk
her
for
three
weeks
that
the
smell
was
at
all
bearable
but
even
then
it
could
never
be
eradicated
and
the
admiral
sent
the
brig
home
and
she
was
sold
out
of
the
service
they
could
do
nothing
with
her
at
the
dockyards
she
was
broken
up
and
bought
by
the
people
at
brighton
and
tunbridge
wells
who
used
her
timbers
for
turning
fancy
articles
which
smelling
as
they
did
so
strongly
of
otto
of
roses
proved
very
profitable
were
you
ever
at
brighton
mr
simple
never
sir
just
at
this
moment
the
officer
of
the
watch
came
down
to
say
that
there
was
a
very
large
shark
under
the
counter
and
wished
to
know
if
the
captain
had
any
objection
to
the
officers
attempting
to
catch
it
by
no
means
replied
captain
kearney
i
hate
sharks
as
i
do
the
devil
i
nearly
lost
by
one
when
i
was
in
the
mediterranean
may
i
inquire
how
captain
kearney
said
the
first
lieutenant
with
a
demure
face
i
very
anxious
to
know
why
the
story
is
simply
this
replied
the
captain
i
had
an
old
relation
at
malta
whom
i
found
out
by
accident
an
old
maid
of
sixty
who
had
lived
all
her
life
on
the
island
it
was
by
mere
accident
that
i
knew
of
her
existence
i
was
walking
upon
strada
reale
when
i
saw
a
large
baboon
that
was
kept
there
who
had
a
little
fat
by
the
tail
which
he
was
pulling
away
with
him
while
an
old
lady
was
screaming
out
for
help
for
whenever
she
ran
to
assist
her
dog
the
baboon
made
at
her
as
if
he
would
have
ravished
her
and
caught
her
by
the
petticoats
with
one
hand
while
he
held
the
fast
by
the
other
i
owed
that
brute
a
spite
for
having
attacked
me
one
night
when
i
passed
him
and
perceiving
what
was
going
on
i
drew
my
sword
and
gave
mr
jacko
such
a
clip
as
sent
him
away
howling
and
bleeding
like
a
pig
leaving
me
in
possession
of
the
little
pug
which
i
took
up
and
handed
to
his
mistress
the
old
lady
trembled
very
much
and
begged
me
to
see
her
safe
home
she
had
a
very
fine
house
and
after
she
was
seated
on
the
sofa
thanked
me
very
much
for
my
gallant
assistance
as
she
termed
it
and
told
me
her
name
was
kearney
upon
this
i
very
soon
proved
my
relationship
with
her
at
which
she
was
much
delighted
requesting
me
to
consider
her
house
as
my
home
i
was
for
two
years
afterwards
on
that
station
and
played
my
cards
very
well
and
the
old
lady
gave
me
a
hint
that
i
should
be
her
heir
as
she
had
no
other
relations
that
she
knew
anything
of
at
last
i
was
ordered
home
and
not
wishing
to
leave
her
i
begged
her
to
accompany
me
offering
her
my
cabin
she
was
taken
very
ill
a
fortnight
before
we
sailed
and
made
a
will
leaving
me
her
sole
heir
but
she
recovered
and
got
as
fat
as
ever
mr
simple
the
wine
stands
with
you
i
doubt
if
lord
privilege
gave
you
better
claret
than
there
is
in
that
bottle
i
imported
it
myself
ten
years
ago
when
i
commanded
the
very
odd
observed
the
first
lieutenant
we
bought
some
at
barbadoes
with
the
same
mark
on
the
bottles
and
cork
that
may
be
replied
the
captain
houses
all
keep
up
the
same
marks
but
i
doubt
if
your
wine
can
be
compared
to
this
as
mr
phillott
wished
to
hear
the
end
of
the
captain
story
he
would
not
contradict
him
this
time
by
stating
what
he
knew
to
be
the
case
that
the
captain
had
sent
it
on
board
at
barbadoes
and
the
captain
proceeded
well
i
gave
up
my
cabin
to
the
old
lady
and
hung
up
my
cot
in
the
during
the
passage
home
we
were
becalmed
abreast
of
ceuta
for
two
days
the
old
lady
was
very
particular
about
her
and
i
superintended
the
washing
of
the
little
brute
twice
a
week
but
at
last
i
was
tired
of
it
and
gave
him
to
my
coxswain
to
bathe
my
coxswain
who
was
a
lazy
fellow
without
my
knowledge
used
to
put
the
little
beast
into
the
bight
of
a
rope
and
tow
him
overboard
for
a
minute
or
so
it
was
during
this
calm
that
he
had
him
overboard
in
this
way
when
a
confounded
shark
rose
from
under
the
counter
and
took
in
the
at
one
mouthful
the
coxswain
reported
the
loss
as
a
thing
of
no
consequence
but
i
knew
better
and
put
the
fellow
in
irons
i
then
went
down
and
broke
the
melancholy
fact
to
miss
kearney
stating
that
i
had
put
the
man
in
irons
and
would
flog
him
well
the
old
lady
broke
out
into
a
most
violent
passion
at
the
intelligence
declared
that
it
was
my
fault
that
i
was
jealous
of
the
dog
and
had
done
it
on
purpose
the
more
i
protested
the
more
she
raved
and
at
last
i
was
obliged
to
go
on
deck
to
avoid
her
abuse
and
keep
my
temper
i
had
not
been
on
deck
five
minutes
before
she
came
up
that
is
was
shoved
up
for
she
was
so
heavy
that
she
could
not
get
up
without
assistance
you
know
how
elephants
in
india
push
the
cannon
through
a
morass
with
their
heads
from
behind
well
my
steward
used
to
shove
her
up
the
just
in
the
same
way
with
his
head
completely
buried
in
her
petticoats
as
soon
as
she
was
up
he
used
to
pull
his
head
out
looking
as
red
and
hot
as
a
lobster
well
up
she
came
with
her
will
in
her
hand
and
looking
at
me
very
fiercely
she
said
the
shark
has
taken
my
dear
dog
he
may
have
my
will
also
and
throwing
it
overboard
she
plumped
down
on
the
carronade
slide
very
well
madam
said
i
you
be
cool
and
then
you
make
another
will
swear
by
all
the
hopes
that
i
have
of
going
to
heaven
that
i
never
will
she
replied
you
will
madam
replied
i
so
help
me
god
captain
kearney
my
money
may
now
go
to
my
next
heir
and
that
you
know
will
not
be
you
now
as
i
knew
very
well
that
the
old
lady
was
very
positive
and
as
good
as
her
word
my
object
was
to
recover
the
will
which
was
floating
about
fifty
yards
astern
without
her
knowledge
i
thought
a
moment
and
then
i
called
the
boatswain
mate
to
all
hands
to
excuse
me
miss
kearney
said
i
the
men
are
going
to
bathe
and
i
do
not
think
you
would
like
to
see
them
all
naked
if
you
would
you
can
stay
on
deck
she
looked
daggers
at
me
and
rising
from
the
carronade
slide
hobbled
to
the
ladder
saying
the
insult
was
another
proof
of
how
little
i
deserved
any
kindness
from
her
as
soon
as
she
was
below
the
were
lowered
down
and
i
went
in
one
of
them
and
picked
up
the
will
which
still
floated
brigs
having
no
of
course
she
could
not
see
my
manoeuvre
but
thought
that
the
will
was
lost
for
ever
we
had
very
bad
weather
after
that
owing
to
which
with
the
loss
of
her
favourite
pug
and
constant
quarrelling
with
me
for
i
did
all
i
could
to
annoy
her
afterwards
she
fell
ill
and
was
buried
a
fortnight
after
she
was
landed
at
plymouth
the
old
lady
kept
her
word
she
never
made
another
will
i
proved
the
one
i
had
recovered
at
doctors
commons
and
touched
the
whole
of
her
money
as
neither
the
first
lieutenant
nor
i
could
prove
whether
the
story
was
true
or
not
of
course
we
expressed
our
congratulations
at
his
good
fortune
and
soon
afterwards
left
the
cabin
to
report
his
marvellous
story
to
our
messmates
when
i
went
on
deck
i
found
that
the
shark
had
just
been
hooked
and
was
hauling
on
board
mr
phillott
had
also
come
on
deck
the
officers
were
all
eager
about
the
shark
and
were
looking
over
the
side
calling
to
each
other
and
giving
directions
to
the
men
now
although
certainly
there
was
a
want
of
decorum
on
the
still
the
captain
having
given
permission
it
was
to
be
excused
but
mr
phillott
thought
otherwise
and
commenced
in
his
usual
style
beginning
with
the
marine
officer
mr
westley
i
trouble
you
not
to
be
getting
upon
the
hammocks
you
get
off
directly
sir
if
one
of
your
fellows
were
to
do
so
stop
his
grog
for
a
month
and
i
do
see
why
you
are
to
set
a
bad
example
you
been
too
long
in
barracks
sir
by
half
who
is
that
mr
williams
and
mr
moore
both
on
the
hammocks
too
up
to
the
foretopmast
head
both
of
you
directly
mr
thomas
up
to
the
main
and
i
say
you
youngster
stealing
off
perch
yourself
upon
the
and
let
me
know
when
you
rode
to
london
by
god
the
service
is
going
to
hell
i
do
know
what
officers
are
made
of
i
marry
some
of
you
young
gentlemen
to
the
gunner
daughter
before
long
no
better
than
a
no
wonder
when
lieutenants
set
the
example
this
latter
remark
could
only
be
applied
to
who
stood
in
the
giving
directions
before
the
tirade
of
mr
phillott
stopped
the
amusement
of
the
party
immediately
stepped
out
of
the
boat
and
going
up
to
mr
phillott
touched
his
hat
and
said
mr
phillott
we
had
the
captain
permission
to
catch
the
shark
and
a
shark
is
not
to
be
got
on
board
by
walking
up
and
down
on
the
as
regards
myself
as
long
as
the
captain
is
on
board
i
hold
myself
responsible
to
him
alone
for
my
conduct
and
if
you
think
i
have
done
wrong
forward
your
complaint
but
if
you
pretend
to
use
such
language
to
me
as
you
have
to
others
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
i
am
here
sir
as
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
and
will
be
treated
as
such
and
allow
me
to
observe
that
i
consider
the
more
disgraced
by
foul
and
ungentlemanly
language
than
i
do
by
an
officer
accidentally
standing
upon
the
hammocks
however
as
you
have
thought
proper
to
interfere
you
may
now
get
the
shark
on
board
yourself
mr
phillott
turned
very
red
for
he
never
had
come
in
contact
in
this
way
with
all
the
other
officers
had
submitted
quietly
to
his
unpleasant
manner
of
speaking
to
them
very
well
mr
i
shall
hold
you
answerable
for
this
language
replied
he
and
shall
most
certainly
report
your
conduct
to
the
captain
i
will
save
you
the
trouble
captain
kearney
is
now
coming
up
and
i
will
report
it
myself
this
did
upon
the
captain
putting
his
foot
on
the
well
observed
the
captain
to
mr
phillott
what
is
it
you
complain
of
mr
language
sir
am
i
to
be
addressed
on
the
in
that
manner
i
really
must
say
mr
phillott
replied
captain
kearney
that
i
do
not
perceive
anything
in
what
mr
said
but
what
is
correct
i
command
here
and
if
an
officer
so
nearly
equal
in
rank
to
yourself
has
committed
himself
you
are
not
to
take
the
law
into
your
own
hands
the
fact
is
mr
phillott
your
language
is
not
quite
so
correct
as
i
could
wish
it
i
overheard
every
word
that
passed
and
i
consider
that
have
treated
officer
with
disrespect
that
is
i
gave
permission
that
the
shark
should
be
caught
and
with
that
permission
i
consequently
allowed
those
little
deviations
from
the
discipline
of
the
service
which
must
inevitably
take
place
yet
you
have
thought
proper
to
interfere
with
my
permission
which
is
tantamount
to
an
order
and
have
made
use
of
harsh
language
and
punished
the
young
gentlemen
for
obeying
my
injunctions
you
will
oblige
me
sir
by
calling
them
all
down
and
in
restraining
your
petulance
for
the
future
i
will
always
support
your
authority
when
you
are
correct
but
i
regret
that
in
this
instance
you
have
necessitated
me
to
weaken
it
this
was
a
most
severe
check
to
mr
phillott
who
immediately
went
below
after
hailing
the
mastheads
and
calling
down
the
midshipmen
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
we
were
all
on
the
hammocks
again
the
shark
was
hauled
forward
hoisted
on
board
and
every
in
the
ship
was
in
requisition
we
were
all
much
pleased
with
captain
kearney
conduct
on
this
occasion
and
as
observed
to
me
he
really
is
a
good
fellow
and
clever
officer
what
a
thousand
pities
it
is
that
he
is
such
a
confounded
liar
i
must
do
mr
phillott
the
justice
to
say
that
he
bore
no
malice
on
this
occasion
but
treated
us
as
before
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
in
his
favour
when
it
is
considered
what
power
a
first
lieutenant
has
of
annoying
and
punishing
his
inferiors
chapter
xxxiii
another
between
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
expedition
mr
chucks
mistaken
he
dies
like
a
gentleman
swinburne
begins
his
account
of
the
battle
off
st
vincent
we
had
not
been
more
than
a
week
under
the
danish
island
of
st
thomas
when
we
discovered
a
brig
close
we
made
all
sail
in
chase
and
soon
came
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
shore
when
she
anchored
under
a
battery
which
opened
its
fire
upon
us
their
elevation
was
too
great
and
several
shots
passed
over
us
and
between
our
masts
i
once
met
with
a
very
remarkable
circumstance
observed
captain
kearney
three
guns
were
fired
at
a
frigate
i
was
on
board
of
from
a
battery
all
at
the
same
time
the
three
shots
cut
away
the
three
topsail
ties
and
down
came
all
our
topsail
yards
upon
the
cap
at
the
same
time
that
the
frenchmen
might
not
suppose
that
they
had
taken
such
good
aim
we
turned
up
our
hands
to
reef
topsails
and
by
the
time
that
the
men
were
off
the
yards
the
ties
were
spliced
and
the
topsails
run
up
again
mr
phillott
could
not
stand
this
most
enormous
fib
and
he
replied
very
odd
indeed
captain
kearney
but
i
have
known
a
stranger
circumstance
we
had
put
in
the
powder
to
the
four
guns
on
the
main
deck
when
we
were
fighting
the
danish
in
a
frigate
i
was
in
and
as
the
men
withdrew
the
rammer
a
shot
from
the
enemy
entered
the
muzzle
and
completed
the
loading
of
each
gun
we
fired
their
own
shot
back
upon
them
and
this
occurred
three
times
running
upon
my
word
replied
captain
kearney
who
had
his
glass
upon
the
battery
i
think
you
must
have
dreamt
that
circumstance
mr
phillott
not
more
than
you
did
about
the
topsail
ties
captain
kearney
captain
kearney
at
that
time
had
the
long
glass
in
his
hand
holding
it
up
over
his
shoulder
a
shot
from
the
battery
whizzed
over
his
head
and
took
the
glass
out
of
his
hand
shivering
it
to
pieces
that
once
said
captain
kearney
very
coolly
but
will
you
pretend
that
that
could
ever
happen
three
times
running
they
might
take
my
head
off
or
my
arm
next
time
but
not
another
glass
whereas
the
topsail
ties
might
be
cut
by
three
different
shot
but
give
me
another
glass
mr
simple
i
am
certain
that
this
vessel
is
a
privateer
what
think
you
mr
i
am
every
bit
of
your
opinion
captain
kearney
replied
and
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
pretty
bit
of
practice
to
the
ship
company
to
take
her
out
from
under
that
footy
battery
starboard
the
helm
mr
phillott
keep
away
four
points
and
then
we
will
think
of
it
the
frigate
was
now
kept
away
and
ran
out
of
the
fire
of
the
battery
it
was
then
about
an
hour
before
sunset
and
in
the
west
indies
the
sun
does
not
set
as
it
does
in
the
northern
latitudes
there
is
no
twilight
he
descends
in
glory
surrounded
with
clouds
of
gold
and
rubies
in
their
gorgeous
tints
and
once
below
the
horizon
all
is
dark
as
soon
as
it
was
dark
we
hauled
our
wind
off
shore
and
a
consultation
being
held
between
the
captain
mr
phillott
and
the
captain
at
last
decided
that
the
attempt
should
be
made
indeed
although
is
a
very
serious
affair
as
you
combat
under
every
disadvantage
still
the
mischief
done
to
our
trade
by
the
privateers
was
so
great
in
the
west
indies
that
almost
every
sacrifice
was
warrantable
for
the
interests
of
the
country
still
captain
kearney
although
a
brave
and
prudent
officer
one
who
calculated
chances
and
who
would
not
risk
his
men
without
he
deemed
that
necessity
imperiously
demanded
that
such
should
be
done
was
averse
to
this
attack
from
his
knowledge
of
the
bay
in
which
the
brig
was
anchored
and
although
mr
phillott
and
both
were
of
opinion
that
it
should
be
a
night
attack
captain
kearney
decided
otherwise
he
considered
that
although
the
risk
might
be
greater
yet
the
force
employed
would
be
more
consolidated
and
that
those
who
would
hold
back
in
the
night
dare
not
do
so
during
the
day
moreover
that
the
people
on
shore
in
the
battery
as
well
as
those
in
the
privateer
would
be
on
the
alert
all
night
and
not
expecting
an
attack
during
the
day
would
be
taken
off
their
guard
it
was
therefore
directed
that
everything
should
be
in
preparation
during
the
night
and
that
the
boats
should
shove
off
before
daylight
and
row
concealing
themselves
behind
some
rocks
under
the
cliffs
which
formed
the
cape
upon
one
side
of
the
harbour
and
if
not
discovered
remain
there
till
noon
at
which
time
it
was
probable
that
the
privateer
men
would
be
on
shore
and
the
vessel
might
be
captured
without
difficulty
it
is
always
a
scene
of
much
interest
on
board
a
when
preparations
are
made
for
an
expedition
of
this
description
and
as
the
reader
may
not
have
been
witness
to
them
it
may
perhaps
be
interesting
to
describe
them
the
boats
of
have
generally
two
crews
the
common
boats
crews
which
are
selected
so
as
not
to
take
away
the
most
useful
men
from
the
ship
and
the
service
or
fighting
boats
crews
which
are
selected
from
the
very
best
men
on
board
the
coxswains
of
the
boats
are
the
most
trustworthy
men
in
the
ship
and
on
this
occasion
have
to
see
that
their
boats
are
properly
equipped
the
launch
yawl
first
and
second
cutters
were
the
boats
appointed
for
the
expedition
they
all
carried
guns
mounted
upon
slides
which
ran
fore
and
aft
between
the
men
after
the
boats
were
hoisted
out
the
guns
were
lowered
down
into
them
and
shipped
in
the
bows
of
the
boats
the
were
next
handed
in
which
contain
the
cartridges
and
ammunition
the
shot
were
put
into
the
bottom
of
the
boats
and
so
far
they
were
all
ready
the
oars
of
the
boats
were
fitted
to
pull
with
grummets
upon
iron
that
they
might
make
little
noise
and
might
swing
fore
and
aft
without
falling
overboard
when
the
boats
pulled
alongside
the
privateer
a
breaker
or
two
that
is
small
casks
holding
about
seven
gallons
each
of
water
was
put
into
each
boat
and
also
the
allowance
of
spirits
in
case
they
should
be
detained
by
any
unforeseen
circumstances
the
men
belonging
to
the
boats
were
fully
employed
in
looking
after
their
arms
some
fitting
their
flints
to
their
pistols
others
and
the
major
part
of
them
sharpening
their
cutlasses
at
the
grindstone
or
with
a
file
borrowed
from
the
armourer
all
were
busy
and
all
merry
the
very
idea
of
going
into
action
is
a
source
of
joy
to
an
english
sailor
and
more
jokes
are
made
more
merriment
excited
at
that
time
than
at
any
other
then
as
it
often
happens
that
one
or
two
of
the
service
boats
crews
may
be
on
the
sick
list
urgent
solicitations
are
made
by
others
that
they
may
supply
their
places
the
only
parties
who
appear
at
all
grave
are
those
who
are
to
remain
in
the
frigate
and
not
share
in
the
expedition
there
is
no
occasion
to
order
the
boats
to
be
manned
for
the
men
are
generally
in
long
before
they
are
piped
away
indeed
one
would
think
that
it
was
a
party
of
pleasure
instead
of
danger
and
of
death
upon
which
they
were
about
to
proceed
captain
kearney
selected
the
officers
who
were
to
have
the
charge
of
the
boats
he
would
not
trust
any
of
the
midshipmen
on
so
dangerous
a
service
he
said
that
he
had
known
so
many
occasions
in
which
their
rashness
and
foolhardiness
had
spoilt
an
expedition
he
therefore
appointed
mr
phillott
the
first
lieutenant
to
the
launch
to
the
yawl
the
master
to
the
first
and
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
to
the
second
cutter
mr
chucks
was
much
pleased
with
the
idea
of
having
the
command
of
a
boat
and
asked
me
to
come
with
him
to
which
i
consented
although
i
had
intended
as
usual
to
have
gone
with
about
an
hour
before
daylight
we
ran
the
frigate
to
within
a
mile
and
a
half
of
the
shore
and
the
boats
shoved
off
the
frigate
then
wore
round
and
stood
out
in
the
offing
that
she
might
at
daylight
be
at
such
a
distance
as
not
to
excite
any
suspicion
that
our
boats
were
sent
away
while
we
in
the
boats
pulled
quietly
we
were
not
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
we
arrived
at
the
cape
forming
one
side
of
the
bay
and
were
well
secreted
among
the
cluster
of
rocks
which
were
underneath
our
oars
were
laid
in
the
boats
painters
made
fast
and
orders
given
for
the
strictest
silence
the
rocks
were
very
high
and
the
boats
were
not
to
be
seen
without
any
one
should
come
to
the
edge
of
the
precipice
and
even
then
they
would
in
all
probability
have
been
supposed
to
have
been
rocks
the
water
was
as
smooth
as
glass
and
when
it
was
broad
daylight
the
men
hung
listlessly
over
the
sides
of
the
boats
looking
at
the
corals
below
and
watching
the
fish
as
they
glided
between
i
ca
say
mr
simple
said
mr
chucks
to
me
in
an
under
tone
that
i
think
well
of
this
expedition
and
i
have
an
idea
that
some
of
us
will
lose
the
number
of
our
mess
after
a
calm
comes
a
storm
and
how
quiet
is
everything
now
but
i
take
off
my
great
coat
for
the
sun
is
hot
already
coxswain
give
me
my
jacket
mr
chucks
had
put
on
his
great
coat
but
not
his
jacket
underneath
which
he
had
left
on
one
of
the
guns
on
the
main
deck
all
ready
to
change
as
soon
as
the
heavy
dew
had
gone
off
the
coxswain
handed
him
the
jacket
and
mr
chucks
threw
off
his
great
coat
to
put
it
on
but
when
it
was
opened
it
proved
that
by
mistake
he
had
taken
away
the
jacket
surmounted
by
two
small
epaulettes
belonging
to
captain
kearney
which
the
captain
steward
who
had
taken
it
out
to
brush
had
also
laid
upon
the
same
gun
by
all
the
nobility
of
england
cried
mr
chucks
i
have
taken
away
the
captain
jacket
by
mistake
here
a
pretty
mess
if
i
put
on
my
great
coat
i
shall
be
dead
with
sweating
if
i
put
on
no
jacket
i
shall
be
roasted
brown
but
if
i
put
on
the
captain
jacket
i
shall
be
considered
disrespectful
the
men
in
the
boats
tittered
and
mr
phillott
who
was
in
the
launch
next
to
us
turned
round
to
see
what
was
the
matter
was
sitting
in
the
of
the
launch
with
the
first
lieutenant
and
i
leaned
over
and
told
them
by
the
powers
i
do
see
why
the
captain
jacket
will
be
at
all
hurt
by
mr
chucks
putting
it
on
replied
unless
indeed
a
bullet
were
to
go
through
it
and
then
it
wo
be
any
fault
of
mr
chucks
no
replied
the
first
lieutenant
and
if
one
did
the
captain
might
keep
the
jacket
and
swear
that
the
bullet
went
round
his
body
without
wounding
him
he
have
a
good
yarn
to
spin
so
put
it
on
mr
chucks
you
make
a
good
mark
for
the
enemy
that
i
will
stand
the
risk
of
with
pleasure
observed
the
boatswain
to
me
for
the
sake
of
being
considered
a
gentleman
so
here
on
with
it
there
was
a
general
laugh
when
mr
chucks
pulled
on
the
captain
jacket
and
sank
down
in
the
of
the
cutter
with
great
complacency
of
countenance
one
of
the
men
in
the
boat
that
we
were
in
thought
proper
however
to
continue
his
laugh
a
little
longer
than
mr
chucks
considered
necessary
who
leaning
forward
thus
addressed
him
i
say
mr
webber
i
beg
leave
to
observe
to
you
in
the
most
delicate
manner
in
the
world
just
to
hint
to
you
that
it
is
not
the
custom
to
laugh
at
your
superior
officer
i
mean
just
to
insinuate
that
you
are
a
d
d
impudent
son
of
a
sea
cook
and
if
we
both
live
and
do
well
i
will
prove
to
you
that
if
i
am
to
be
laughed
at
in
a
boat
with
the
jacket
on
that
i
am
not
to
be
laughed
at
on
board
the
frigate
with
the
boatswain
rattan
in
my
fist
and
so
look
out
my
hearty
for
squalls
when
you
come
on
the
forecastle
for
i
be
d
d
if
i
do
make
you
see
more
stars
than
god
almighty
ever
made
and
cut
more
capers
than
all
the
in
france
mark
my
words
you
son
of
a
bitch
mr
chucks
having
at
the
end
of
this
oration
raised
his
voice
above
the
pitch
required
by
the
exigency
of
the
service
was
called
to
order
by
the
first
lieutenant
and
again
sank
back
into
the
with
all
the
importance
and
authoritative
show
peculiarly
appertaining
to
a
pair
of
epaulettes
we
waited
behind
the
rocks
until
noonday
without
being
discovered
by
the
enemy
so
well
were
we
concealed
we
had
already
sent
an
officer
who
carefully
hiding
himself
by
lying
down
on
the
rocks
had
several
times
reconnoitred
the
enemy
boats
were
passing
and
repassing
continually
from
the
privateer
to
the
shore
and
it
appeared
that
they
went
on
shore
full
of
men
and
returned
with
only
one
or
two
so
that
we
were
in
great
hopes
that
we
should
find
but
few
men
to
defend
the
vessel
mr
phillott
looked
at
his
watch
held
it
up
to
to
prove
that
he
had
complied
exactly
with
the
orders
he
had
received
from
the
captain
and
then
gave
the
word
to
get
the
boats
under
weigh
the
painters
were
cast
off
by
the
bowmen
the
guns
were
loaded
and
primed
the
men
seized
their
oars
and
in
two
minutes
we
were
clear
of
the
rocks
and
drawn
up
in
a
line
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
harbour
mouth
and
not
half
a
mile
from
the
privateer
brig
we
rowed
as
quickly
as
possible
but
we
did
not
cheer
until
the
enemy
fired
the
first
gun
which
he
did
from
a
quarter
unexpected
as
we
entered
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
with
our
union
jack
trailing
in
the
water
over
our
stern
for
it
was
a
dead
calm
it
appeared
that
at
the
low
point
under
the
cliffs
at
each
side
of
the
little
bay
they
had
raised
a
water
battery
of
two
guns
each
one
of
these
guns
laden
with
grape
shot
was
now
fired
at
the
boats
but
the
elevation
was
too
low
and
although
the
water
was
ploughed
up
to
within
five
yards
of
the
launch
no
injury
was
received
we
were
equally
fortunate
in
the
discharge
of
the
other
three
guns
two
of
which
we
passed
so
quickly
that
they
were
not
aimed
sufficiently
forward
so
that
their
shot
fell
astern
and
the
other
although
the
shot
fell
among
us
did
no
further
injury
than
cutting
in
half
two
of
the
oars
of
the
first
cutter
in
the
meantime
we
had
observed
that
the
boats
had
shoved
off
from
the
privateer
as
soon
as
they
had
perceived
us
and
had
returned
to
her
laden
with
men
the
boats
had
been
despatched
a
second
time
but
had
not
yet
returned
they
were
now
about
the
same
distance
from
the
privateer
as
were
our
boats
and
it
was
quite
undecided
which
of
us
would
be
first
on
board
perceiving
this
painted
out
to
mr
phillott
that
we
should
first
attack
the
boats
and
afterwards
board
on
the
side
to
which
they
pulled
as
in
all
probability
there
would
be
an
opening
left
in
the
boarding
nettings
which
were
tied
up
to
the
and
presented
a
formidable
obstacle
to
our
success
mr
phillott
agreed
with
he
ordered
the
bowmen
to
lay
in
their
oars
and
keep
the
guns
pointed
ready
to
fire
at
the
word
given
and
desiring
the
other
men
to
pull
their
best
every
nerve
every
muscle
was
brought
into
play
by
our
anxious
and
intrepid
seamen
when
within
about
twenty
yards
of
the
vessel
and
also
of
the
boats
the
orders
were
given
to
fire
the
carronade
of
the
launch
poured
out
round
and
grape
so
well
directed
that
one
of
the
french
boats
sunk
immediately
and
the
musket
balls
with
which
our
other
smaller
guns
were
loaded
did
great
execution
among
their
men
in
one
minute
more
with
three
cheers
from
our
sailors
we
were
all
alongside
together
english
and
french
boats
and
a
most
determined
close
conflict
took
place
the
french
fought
desperately
and
as
they
were
overpowered
they
were
reinforced
by
those
from
the
privateer
who
could
not
look
on
and
behold
their
companions
requiring
their
assistance
without
coming
to
their
aid
some
jumped
down
into
our
boats
from
the
chains
into
the
midst
of
our
men
others
darted
cold
shot
at
us
either
to
kill
us
or
to
sink
our
boats
and
thus
did
one
of
the
most
desperate
conflicts
take
place
that
ever
was
witnessed
but
it
was
soon
decided
in
our
favour
for
we
were
the
stronger
party
and
the
better
armed
and
when
all
opposition
was
over
we
jumped
into
the
privateer
and
found
not
a
man
left
on
board
only
a
large
dog
who
flew
at
throat
as
he
entered
the
port
do
kill
him
said
as
the
sailors
hastened
to
his
assistance
only
take
away
his
gripe
the
sailors
disengaged
the
dog
and
led
him
up
to
a
gun
saying
by
jasus
my
boy
you
are
my
prisoner
but
although
we
had
possession
of
the
privateer
our
difficulties
as
it
will
prove
were
by
no
means
over
we
were
now
exposed
not
only
to
the
fire
of
the
two
batteries
at
the
which
we
had
to
pass
but
also
to
that
of
the
battery
at
the
bottom
of
the
bay
which
had
fired
at
the
frigate
in
the
meantime
we
were
very
busy
in
cutting
the
cable
lowering
the
topsails
and
taking
the
wounded
men
on
board
the
privateer
from
out
of
the
boats
all
this
was
however
but
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
most
of
the
frenchmen
were
killed
our
own
wounded
amounted
to
only
nine
seamen
and
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
who
was
shot
through
the
body
apparently
with
little
chance
of
surviving
as
mr
phillott
observed
the
captain
epaulettes
had
made
him
a
mark
for
the
enemy
and
he
had
fallen
in
his
borrowed
plumes
as
soon
as
they
were
all
on
board
and
laid
on
the
deck
for
there
were
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
about
fourteen
wounded
frenchmen
as
well
as
our
own
were
got
out
forwards
the
boats
were
manned
and
we
proceeded
to
tow
the
brig
out
of
the
harbour
it
was
a
dead
calm
and
we
made
but
little
way
but
our
boat
crew
flushed
with
victory
cheered
and
rallied
and
pulled
with
all
their
strength
the
enemy
perceiving
that
the
privateer
was
taken
and
the
french
boats
drifting
empty
up
the
harbour
now
opened
their
fire
upon
us
and
with
great
effect
before
we
had
towed
abreast
of
the
two
water
batteries
we
had
received
between
wind
and
water
from
the
other
batteries
and
the
sea
was
pouring
fast
into
the
vessel
i
had
been
attending
to
poor
mr
chucks
who
lay
on
the
starboard
side
near
the
wheel
the
blood
flowing
from
his
wound
and
tracing
its
course
down
the
planks
of
the
deck
to
a
distance
of
some
feet
from
where
he
lay
he
appeared
very
faint
and
i
tied
my
handkerchief
round
his
body
so
as
to
stop
the
effusion
of
blood
and
brought
him
some
water
with
which
i
bathed
his
face
and
poured
some
into
his
mouth
he
opened
his
eyes
wide
and
looked
at
me
ah
mr
simple
said
he
faintly
is
it
you
it
all
over
with
me
but
it
could
not
be
better
could
it
how
do
you
mean
inquired
i
why
have
i
not
fallen
dressed
like
an
officer
and
a
gentleman
said
he
referring
to
the
captain
jacket
and
epaulettes
i
sooner
die
now
with
this
dress
on
than
recover
to
put
on
the
boatswain
uniform
i
feel
quite
happy
he
pressed
my
hand
and
then
closed
his
eyes
again
from
weakness
we
were
now
nearly
abreast
of
the
two
batteries
on
the
points
the
guns
of
which
had
been
trained
so
as
to
bear
upon
our
boats
that
were
towing
out
the
brig
the
first
shot
went
through
the
bottom
of
the
launch
and
sank
her
fortunately
all
the
men
were
saved
but
as
she
was
the
boat
that
towed
next
to
the
brig
great
delay
occurred
in
getting
the
others
clear
of
her
and
taking
the
brig
again
in
tow
the
shot
now
poured
in
thick
and
the
grape
became
very
annoying
still
our
men
gave
way
cheering
at
every
shot
fired
and
we
had
nearly
passed
the
batteries
with
trifling
loss
when
we
perceived
that
the
brig
was
so
full
of
water
that
she
could
not
swim
many
minutes
longer
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
tow
her
alongside
of
the
frigate
mr
phillott
under
these
circumstances
decided
that
it
would
be
useless
to
risk
more
lives
and
that
the
wounded
should
be
taken
out
of
the
brig
and
the
boats
should
pull
away
for
the
ship
he
desired
me
to
get
the
wounded
men
into
the
cutter
which
he
sent
alongside
and
then
to
follow
the
other
boats
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
not
wishing
to
be
left
behind
and
as
soon
as
all
our
wounded
men
were
in
the
boats
i
went
to
mr
chucks
to
remove
him
he
appeared
somewhat
revived
but
would
not
allow
us
to
remove
him
my
dear
mr
simple
said
he
it
is
of
no
use
i
never
can
recover
it
and
i
prefer
dying
here
i
entreat
you
not
to
move
me
if
the
enemy
take
possession
of
the
brig
before
she
sinks
i
shall
be
buried
with
military
honours
if
they
do
not
i
shall
at
least
die
in
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
hasten
away
as
fast
as
you
can
before
you
lose
more
men
here
i
stay
that
decided
i
expostulated
with
him
but
at
that
time
two
boats
full
of
men
appeared
pulling
out
of
the
harbour
to
the
brig
the
enemy
had
perceived
that
our
boats
had
deserted
her
and
were
coming
to
take
possession
i
had
therefore
no
time
to
urge
mr
chucks
to
change
his
resolution
and
not
wishing
to
force
a
dying
man
i
shook
his
hand
and
left
him
it
was
with
some
difficulty
i
escaped
for
the
boats
had
come
up
close
to
the
brig
they
chased
me
a
little
while
but
the
yawl
and
the
cutter
turning
back
to
my
assistance
they
gave
up
the
pursuit
on
the
whole
this
was
a
very
well
arranged
and
well
conducted
expedition
the
only
man
lost
was
mr
chucks
for
the
wounds
of
the
others
were
none
of
them
mortal
captain
kearney
was
quite
satisfied
with
our
conduct
and
so
was
the
admiral
when
it
was
reported
to
him
captain
kearney
did
indeed
grumble
a
little
about
his
jacket
and
sent
for
me
to
inquire
why
i
had
not
taken
it
off
mr
chucks
and
brought
it
on
board
as
i
did
not
choose
to
tell
him
the
exact
truth
i
replied
that
i
could
not
disturb
a
dying
man
and
that
the
jacket
was
so
saturated
with
blood
that
he
never
could
have
worn
it
again
which
was
the
case
at
all
events
you
might
have
brought
away
my
epaulettes
replied
he
but
you
youngsters
think
of
nothing
but
gormandizing
i
had
the
first
watch
that
night
when
swinburne
the
came
up
to
me
and
asked
me
all
the
particulars
of
the
affair
for
he
was
not
in
the
boats
well
said
he
that
mr
chucks
appeared
to
be
a
very
good
boatswain
in
his
way
if
he
could
only
have
kept
his
rattan
a
little
quiet
he
was
a
smart
fellow
and
knew
his
duty
we
had
just
such
another
killed
in
our
ship
in
the
action
off
cape
st
vincent
what
were
you
in
that
action
replied
i
yes
i
was
and
belonged
to
the
lord
nelson
ship
well
then
suppose
you
tell
me
all
about
it
why
mr
simple
d
see
i
no
objection
to
spin
you
a
yarn
now
and
then
replied
swinburne
but
as
mr
chucks
used
to
say
allow
me
to
observe
in
the
most
delicate
manner
in
the
world
that
i
perceive
that
the
man
who
has
charge
of
your
hammock
and
slings
you
a
clean
one
now
and
then
has
very
often
a
good
glass
of
grog
for
his
and
i
do
not
see
but
that
mine
are
as
well
worth
a
glass
of
grog
as
his
so
they
are
swinburne
and
better
too
and
i
promise
you
a
good
stiff
one
evening
that
will
do
sir
now
then
i
tell
you
all
about
it
and
more
about
it
too
than
most
can
for
i
know
how
the
action
was
brought
about
i
have
the
log
marked
the
board
and
then
sat
down
abaft
on
the
signal
chest
with
swinburne
who
commenced
his
narrative
as
follows
you
must
know
mr
simple
that
when
the
english
fleet
came
down
the
mediterranean
after
the
of
corsica
they
did
not
muster
more
than
seventeen
sail
of
the
line
while
the
spanish
fleet
from
ferrol
and
carthagena
had
joined
company
at
cadiz
and
to
near
thirty
sir
john
jervis
had
the
command
of
our
fleet
at
the
time
but
as
the
dons
did
not
seem
at
all
inclined
to
come
out
and
have
a
brush
with
us
almost
two
to
one
sir
john
left
sir
hyde
parker
with
six
sail
of
the
line
to
watch
the
spanish
beggars
while
he
went
in
to
lisbon
with
the
remainder
of
the
fleet
to
water
and
refit
now
you
see
mr
simple
portugal
was
at
that
time
what
they
calls
neutral
that
is
to
say
she
did
meddle
at
all
in
the
affair
being
friends
with
both
parties
and
just
as
willing
to
supply
fresh
beef
and
water
to
the
spaniards
as
to
the
english
if
so
be
the
spaniards
had
come
out
to
ax
for
it
which
they
the
portuguese
and
the
english
have
always
been
the
best
of
friends
because
we
ca
get
no
port
wine
anywhere
else
and
they
ca
get
nobody
else
to
buy
it
of
them
so
the
portuguese
gave
up
their
arsenal
at
lisbon
for
the
use
of
the
english
and
there
we
kept
all
our
stores
under
the
charge
of
that
old
sir
isaac
coffin
now
it
so
happened
that
one
of
the
clerks
in
old
sir
isaac
a
portuguese
chap
had
been
some
time
before
that
in
the
office
of
the
spanish
ambassador
he
was
a
very
smart
sort
of
a
chap
and
sarved
as
interpreter
and
the
old
commissioner
put
great
faith
in
him
but
how
did
you
learn
all
this
swinburne
why
i
tell
you
mr
simple
i
steered
the
yawl
as
coxswain
and
when
admirals
and
captains
talk
in
the
they
very
often
forget
that
the
coxswain
is
close
behind
them
i
only
learnt
half
of
it
that
way
the
rest
i
put
together
when
i
compared
logs
with
the
steward
who
of
course
heard
a
great
deal
now
and
then
the
first
i
heard
of
it
was
when
old
sir
john
called
out
to
sir
isaac
after
the
second
bottle
say
sir
isaac
who
killed
the
spanish
messenger
i
by
god
replied
sir
isaac
only
left
him
for
dead
and
then
they
both
laughed
and
so
did
nelson
who
was
sitting
with
them
well
mr
simple
it
was
reported
to
sir
isaac
that
his
clerk
was
often
seen
taking
memorandums
of
the
different
orders
given
to
the
fleet
particularly
those
as
to
there
being
no
wasteful
expenditure
of
his
majesty
stores
upon
which
sir
isaac
goes
to
the
admiral
and
requests
that
the
man
might
be
discharged
now
old
sir
john
was
a
sly
old
fox
and
he
answered
so
commissioner
perhaps
we
may
catch
them
in
their
own
trap
so
the
admiral
sits
down
and
calls
for
pen
and
ink
and
he
flourishes
out
a
long
letter
to
the
commissioner
stating
that
all
the
stores
of
the
fleet
were
expended
representing
as
how
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
to
sea
without
a
supply
and
wishing
to
know
when
the
commissioner
expected
more
transports
from
england
he
also
said
that
if
the
spanish
fleet
were
now
to
come
out
from
cadiz
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
protect
sir
parker
with
his
six
sail
of
the
line
who
was
watching
the
spanish
fleet
as
he
could
not
quit
the
port
in
his
present
condition
to
this
letter
the
commissioner
answered
that
from
the
last
accounts
he
thought
that
in
the
course
of
six
weeks
or
two
months
they
might
receive
supplies
from
england
but
that
sooner
than
that
was
impossible
these
letters
were
put
in
the
way
of
the
d
d
portuguese
who
copied
them
and
was
seen
that
evening
to
go
into
the
house
of
the
spanish
ambassador
sir
john
then
sent
a
message
to
ferro
that
a
small
town
on
the
portuguese
coast
to
the
southward
with
a
despatch
to
sir
hyde
parker
desiring
him
to
run
away
to
cape
st
vincent
and
decoy
the
spanish
fleet
there
in
case
they
should
come
out
after
him
well
mr
simple
so
far
d
see
the
train
was
well
laid
the
next
thing
to
do
was
to
watch
the
spanish
ambassador
house
and
see
if
he
sent
away
any
despatches
two
days
after
the
letters
had
been
taken
to
him
by
this
rascal
of
a
clerk
the
spanish
ambassador
sent
away
two
messengers
one
for
cadiz
and
the
other
for
madrid
which
is
the
town
where
the
king
of
spain
lives
the
one
to
cadiz
was
permitted
to
go
but
the
one
to
madrid
was
stopped
by
the
directions
of
the
admiral
and
this
job
was
confided
to
the
commissioner
sir
isaac
who
settled
it
somehow
or
another
and
this
was
the
reason
why
the
admiral
called
out
to
him
say
sir
isaac
who
killed
the
messenger
they
brought
back
his
despatches
by
which
they
found
out
that
advice
had
been
sent
to
the
spanish
admiral
i
forget
his
name
something
like
informing
him
of
the
supposed
crippled
state
of
our
squadron
sir
john
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
spaniards
would
not
lose
an
opportunity
of
taking
six
sail
of
the
line
more
english
ships
than
they
have
ever
taken
in
their
lives
waited
a
few
days
to
give
them
time
and
then
sailed
from
lisbon
for
cape
st
vincent
where
he
joined
sir
hyde
parker
and
fell
in
with
the
spaniards
sure
enough
and
a
pretty
drubbing
we
gave
them
now
it
not
everybody
that
could
tell
you
all
that
mr
simple
well
but
now
for
the
action
swinburne
lord
bless
you
mr
simple
it
now
past
seven
bells
and
i
ca
fight
the
battle
of
st
vincent
in
half
an
hour
besides
which
it
well
worth
another
glass
of
grog
to
hear
all
about
that
battle
well
you
shall
have
one
swinburne
only
do
forget
to
tell
it
to
me
swinburne
and
i
then
separated
and
in
less
than
an
hour
afterwards
i
was
dreaming
of
despatches
sir
john
jervis
sir
isaac
coffin
and
spanish
messengers
chapter
xxxiv
good
advice
captain
kearney
again
deals
in
the
marvellous
i
do
not
remember
any
circumstance
in
my
life
which
at
that
time
lay
so
heavily
on
my
mind
as
the
loss
of
poor
mr
chucks
the
boatswain
who
of
course
i
took
it
for
granted
i
should
never
see
again
i
believe
that
the
chief
cause
was
that
at
the
time
i
entered
the
service
and
every
one
considered
me
to
be
the
fool
of
the
family
mr
chucks
and
were
the
only
two
who
thought
of
and
treated
me
differently
and
it
was
their
conduct
which
induced
me
to
apply
myself
and
encouraged
me
to
exertion
i
believe
that
many
a
boy
who
if
properly
patronized
would
turn
out
well
is
by
the
injudicious
system
of
browbeating
and
ridicule
forced
into
the
wrong
path
and
in
his
despair
throws
away
all
and
allows
himself
to
be
carried
away
by
the
stream
to
perdition
was
not
very
partial
to
reading
himself
he
played
the
german
flute
remarkably
well
and
had
a
very
good
voice
his
chief
amusement
was
practising
or
rather
playing
which
is
a
very
different
thing
but
although
he
did
not
study
himself
he
always
made
me
come
into
his
cabin
for
an
hour
or
two
every
day
and
after
i
had
read
repeat
to
him
the
contents
of
the
book
by
this
method
he
not
only
instructed
me
but
gained
a
great
deal
of
information
himself
for
he
made
so
many
remarks
upon
what
i
had
read
that
it
was
impressed
upon
both
our
memories
well
peter
he
would
say
as
he
came
into
the
cabin
what
have
you
to
tell
me
this
morning
sure
it
you
that
the
schoolmaster
and
not
me
for
i
learn
from
you
every
day
i
have
not
read
much
for
i
have
been
thinking
of
poor
mr
chucks
very
right
for
you
so
to
do
peter
never
forget
your
friends
in
a
hurry
you
not
find
too
many
of
them
as
you
trot
along
the
highway
of
life
i
wonder
whether
he
is
dead
why
that
a
question
i
can
not
answer
a
bullet
through
the
chest
do
lengthen
a
man
days
that
certain
but
this
i
know
that
not
die
if
he
can
help
it
now
that
he
got
the
captain
jacket
on
yes
he
always
aspired
to
be
a
gentleman
which
was
absurd
enough
in
a
boatswain
not
at
all
absurd
peter
but
very
absurd
of
you
to
talk
without
thinking
when
did
any
one
of
his
shipmates
ever
know
mr
chucks
to
do
an
unhandsome
or
mean
action
never
and
why
because
he
aspired
to
be
a
gentleman
and
that
feeling
kept
him
above
it
vanity
a
confounded
donkey
very
apt
to
put
his
head
between
his
legs
and
chuck
us
over
but
pride
a
fine
horse
who
will
carry
us
over
the
ground
and
enable
us
to
distance
our
mr
chucks
has
pride
and
always
commendable
even
in
a
boatswain
how
often
have
you
read
of
people
rising
from
nothing
and
becoming
great
men
this
was
from
talent
sure
enough
but
it
was
talent
with
pride
to
force
it
onward
not
talent
with
vanity
to
check
it
you
are
very
right
i
spoke
foolishly
never
mind
peter
nobody
heard
you
but
me
so
it
of
no
consequence
do
you
dine
in
the
cabin
yes
so
do
i
the
captain
is
in
a
most
marvellous
humour
this
morning
he
told
me
one
or
two
yarns
that
quite
staggered
my
politeness
and
my
respect
for
him
on
the
what
a
pity
it
is
that
a
man
should
have
gained
such
a
bad
habit
he
quite
incurable
i
afraid
replied
i
but
certainly
his
fibs
do
no
harm
they
are
what
they
call
white
lies
i
do
not
think
he
would
really
tell
a
lie
that
is
a
lie
which
would
be
considered
to
disgrace
a
gentleman
peter
lies
disgrace
a
gentleman
white
or
black
although
i
grant
there
is
a
difference
to
say
the
least
of
it
it
is
a
dangerous
habit
for
white
lies
are
but
the
gentlemen
ushers
to
black
ones
i
know
but
of
one
point
on
which
a
lie
is
excusable
and
that
is
when
you
wish
to
deceive
the
enemy
then
your
duty
to
your
country
warrants
your
lying
till
you
black
in
the
face
and
for
the
very
reason
that
it
goes
against
your
grain
it
becomes
as
it
were
a
sort
of
virtue
what
was
the
difference
between
the
marine
officer
and
mr
phillott
that
occurred
this
morning
nothing
at
all
in
itself
the
marine
officer
is
a
bit
of
a
gaby
and
takes
offence
where
none
is
meant
mr
phillott
has
a
foul
tongue
but
he
has
a
good
heart
what
a
pity
it
is
it
is
a
pity
for
he
a
smart
officer
but
the
fact
is
peter
that
junior
officers
are
too
apt
to
copy
their
superiors
and
that
makes
it
very
important
that
a
young
gentleman
should
sail
with
a
captain
who
is
a
gentleman
now
phillott
served
the
best
of
his
time
with
captain
ballover
who
is
notorious
in
the
service
for
foul
and
abusive
language
what
is
the
consequence
that
phillott
and
many
others
who
have
served
under
him
have
learnt
his
bad
habit
i
should
think
that
the
very
circumstance
of
having
had
your
feelings
so
often
wounded
by
such
language
when
you
were
a
junior
officer
would
make
you
doubly
careful
not
to
make
use
of
it
to
others
when
you
had
advanced
in
the
service
peter
that
just
the
feeling
which
wears
away
after
a
time
but
at
last
your
own
sense
of
indignation
becomes
blunted
and
becoming
indifferent
to
it
you
forget
also
that
you
wound
the
feelings
of
others
and
carry
the
habit
with
you
to
the
great
injury
and
disgrace
of
the
service
but
it
time
to
dress
for
dinner
so
you
better
make
yourself
scarce
peter
while
i
tidivate
myself
off
a
little
according
to
the
rules
and
regulations
of
his
majesty
service
when
you
are
asked
to
dine
with
the
skipper
we
met
at
the
captain
table
where
we
found
as
usual
a
great
display
of
plate
but
very
little
else
except
the
ship
allowance
we
certainly
had
now
been
cruising
some
time
and
there
was
some
excuse
for
it
but
still
few
captains
would
have
been
so
unprovided
i
afraid
gentlemen
you
will
not
have
a
very
grand
dinner
observed
the
captain
as
the
steward
removed
the
plated
covers
of
the
dishes
but
when
on
service
we
must
rough
it
out
how
we
can
mr
i
recollect
faring
harder
than
this
through
one
cruise
in
a
flush
vessel
we
were
thirteen
weeks
up
to
our
knees
in
water
and
living
the
whole
time
upon
raw
pork
not
being
able
to
light
a
fire
during
the
cruise
pray
captain
kearney
may
i
ask
where
this
happened
to
be
sure
it
was
off
bermudas
we
cruised
for
seven
weeks
before
we
could
find
the
islands
and
began
verily
to
think
that
the
bermudas
were
themselves
on
a
cruise
i
presume
sir
you
were
not
so
sorry
to
have
a
fire
to
cook
your
provisions
when
you
came
to
an
anchor
said
i
beg
your
pardon
replied
captain
kearney
we
had
become
so
accustomed
to
raw
provisions
and
wet
feet
that
we
could
not
eat
our
meals
cooked
or
help
dipping
our
legs
over
the
side
for
a
long
while
afterwards
i
saw
one
of
the
astern
catch
a
large
barracouta
and
eat
it
alive
indeed
if
i
had
not
given
the
strictest
orders
and
flogged
of
them
i
doubt
whether
they
would
not
have
eaten
their
victuals
raw
to
this
day
the
force
of
habit
is
tremendous
it
is
indeed
observed
mr
phillott
drily
and
winking
to
us
referring
to
the
captain
incredible
stories
it
is
indeed
repeated
we
see
the
ditch
in
our
eye
and
can
not
observe
the
log
of
wood
in
our
own
and
winked
at
me
referring
to
phillott
habit
of
bad
language
i
once
knew
a
married
man
observed
the
captain
who
had
been
always
accustomed
to
go
to
sleep
with
his
hand
upon
his
wife
head
and
would
not
allow
her
to
wear
a
nightcap
in
consequence
well
she
caught
cold
and
died
and
he
never
could
sleep
at
night
until
he
took
a
to
bed
with
him
and
laid
his
hand
upon
that
which
answered
the
purpose
such
was
the
force
of
habit
i
once
saw
a
dead
body
galvanized
observed
mr
phillott
it
was
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
taken
a
great
deal
of
snuff
during
his
lifetime
and
as
soon
as
the
battery
was
applied
to
his
spine
the
body
very
gently
raised
its
arm
and
put
its
fingers
to
its
nose
as
if
it
was
taking
a
pinch
you
saw
that
yourself
mr
phillott
observed
the
captain
looking
at
the
first
lieutenant
earnestly
in
the
face
yes
sir
replied
mr
phillott
coolly
have
you
told
that
story
often
very
often
sir
because
i
know
that
some
people
by
constantly
telling
a
story
at
last
believe
it
to
be
true
not
that
i
refer
to
you
mr
phillott
but
still
i
should
recommend
you
not
to
tell
that
story
where
you
are
not
well
known
or
people
may
doubt
your
credibility
i
make
it
a
rule
to
believe
everything
myself
observed
mr
phillott
out
of
politeness
and
i
expect
the
same
courtesy
from
others
then
upon
my
soul
when
you
tell
that
story
you
trespass
very
much
upon
our
good
manners
talking
of
courtesy
you
must
meet
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
been
a
courtier
all
his
life
he
can
not
help
bowing
i
have
seen
him
bow
to
his
horse
and
thank
him
after
he
had
dismounted
beg
pardon
of
a
puppy
for
treading
on
his
tail
and
one
day
when
he
fell
over
a
scraper
he
took
his
hat
off
and
made
it
a
thousand
apologies
for
his
inattention
force
of
habit
again
said
exactly
so
mr
simple
will
you
take
a
slice
of
this
pork
and
perhaps
you
do
me
the
honour
to
take
a
glass
of
wine
lord
privilege
would
not
much
admire
our
dinner
would
he
mr
simple
as
a
variety
he
might
sir
but
not
for
a
continuance
very
truly
said
variety
is
charming
the
negroes
here
get
so
tired
of
salt
fish
and
occra
broth
that
they
eat
dirt
by
way
of
a
relish
mr
how
remarkably
well
you
played
that
sonata
of
pleydel
this
morning
i
am
happy
that
i
did
not
annoy
you
captain
kearney
at
all
events
replied
on
the
contrary
i
am
very
partial
to
good
music
my
mother
was
a
great
performer
i
recollect
once
she
was
performing
a
piece
on
the
piano
in
which
she
had
to
imitate
a
so
admirably
did
she
hit
it
off
that
when
we
went
to
tea
all
the
cream
was
as
well
as
three
casks
of
in
the
cellar
at
this
assertion
mr
phillott
could
contain
himself
no
longer
he
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
and
having
a
glass
of
wine
to
his
lips
spattered
it
all
over
the
table
and
over
me
who
unfortunately
was
opposite
to
him
i
really
beg
pardon
captain
kearney
but
the
idea
of
such
an
expensive
talent
was
too
amusing
will
you
permit
me
to
ask
you
a
question
as
there
could
not
have
been
thunder
without
lightning
were
any
people
killed
at
the
same
time
by
the
electric
fluid
of
the
piano
no
sir
replied
captain
kearney
very
angrily
but
her
performance
us
which
was
something
like
it
perhaps
mr
phillott
as
you
lost
your
last
glass
of
wine
you
will
allow
me
to
take
another
with
you
with
great
pleasure
replied
the
first
lieutenant
who
perceived
that
he
had
gone
far
enough
well
gentlemen
said
the
captain
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
land
of
plenty
i
shall
cruise
a
fortnight
more
and
then
join
the
admiral
at
jamaica
we
must
make
out
our
despatch
relative
to
the
cutting
out
of
the
that
was
the
name
of
the
privateer
brig
and
i
am
happy
to
say
that
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
make
honourable
mention
of
all
the
party
present
steward
coffee
the
first
lieutenant
and
i
bowed
to
this
flattering
avowal
on
the
part
of
the
captain
as
for
me
i
felt
delighted
the
idea
of
my
name
being
mentioned
in
the
gazette
and
the
pleasure
that
it
would
give
to
my
father
and
mother
mantled
the
blood
in
my
cheeks
till
i
was
as
red
as
a
simple
said
the
captain
you
have
no
occasion
to
blush
your
conduct
deserves
it
and
you
are
indebted
to
mr
phillott
for
having
made
me
acquainted
with
your
gallantry
coffee
was
soon
over
and
i
was
glad
to
leave
the
cabin
and
be
alone
that
i
might
compose
my
perturbed
mind
i
felt
too
happy
i
did
not
however
say
a
word
to
my
messmates
as
it
might
have
created
feelings
of
envy
or
gave
me
a
caution
not
to
do
so
when
i
met
him
afterwards
so
that
i
was
very
glad
that
i
had
been
so
circumspect
chapter
xxxv
swinburne
continues
his
narrative
of
the
battle
off
cape
st
vincent
the
second
night
after
this
we
had
the
middle
watch
and
i
claimed
swinburne
promise
that
he
would
spin
his
yarn
relative
to
the
battle
of
st
vincent
well
mr
simple
so
i
will
but
i
require
a
little
priming
or
i
shall
never
go
off
will
you
have
your
glass
of
grog
before
or
after
before
by
all
means
if
you
please
sir
run
down
and
get
it
and
heave
the
log
for
you
in
the
meantime
when
we
shall
have
a
good
hour
without
interruption
for
the
will
be
steady
and
we
are
under
easy
sail
i
brought
up
a
stiff
glass
of
grog
which
swinburne
tossed
off
and
as
he
finished
it
sighed
deeply
as
if
in
sorrow
that
there
was
no
more
having
stowed
away
the
tumbler
in
one
of
the
capstern
holes
for
the
present
we
sat
down
upon
a
coil
of
ropes
under
the
weather
bulwarks
and
swinburne
replacing
his
quid
of
tobacco
commenced
as
follows
well
mr
simple
as
i
told
you
before
old
jervis
started
with
all
his
fleet
for
cape
st
vincent
we
lost
one
of
our
fleet
and
a
too
the
she
took
the
ground
and
was
obliged
to
go
back
to
lisbon
but
we
soon
afterwards
were
joined
by
five
sail
of
the
line
sent
out
from
england
so
that
we
mustered
fifteen
sail
in
all
we
had
like
to
lose
another
of
our
mess
for
d
see
the
old
and
fell
foul
of
each
other
and
the
had
the
worst
on
it
but
troubridge
who
commanded
her
was
not
a
man
to
shy
his
work
and
ax
to
go
in
to
refit
when
there
was
a
chance
of
meeting
the
enemy
so
he
patched
her
up
somehow
or
another
and
reported
himself
ready
for
action
the
very
next
day
ready
for
action
he
always
was
that
sure
enough
but
whether
his
ship
was
in
a
fit
state
to
go
into
action
is
quite
another
thing
but
as
the
sailors
used
to
say
in
joking
he
was
a
and
you
might
trust
to
him
which
meant
as
much
as
to
say
that
he
knew
how
to
take
his
ship
into
action
and
how
to
fight
her
when
he
was
fairly
in
it
i
think
it
was
the
next
day
that
cockburn
joined
us
in
the
and
he
brought
nelson
along
with
him
with
the
intelligence
that
the
dons
had
chased
him
and
that
the
whole
spanish
fleet
was
out
in
pursuit
of
us
well
mr
simple
you
may
guess
we
were
not
a
little
happy
in
the
when
nelson
joined
us
as
we
knew
that
if
he
fell
in
with
the
spaniards
our
ship
would
cut
a
figure
and
so
she
did
sure
enough
that
was
on
the
morning
of
the
and
old
jervis
made
the
signal
to
prepare
for
action
and
keep
close
order
which
means
to
have
your
flying
in
at
the
starn
windows
of
the
ship
ahead
of
you
and
we
did
keep
close
order
for
a
man
might
have
walked
right
round
from
one
ship
to
the
other
either
lee
or
weather
line
of
the
fleet
i
forget
that
night
mr
simple
as
long
as
i
live
and
breathe
every
now
and
then
we
heard
the
signal
guns
of
the
spanish
fleet
booming
at
a
distance
to
windward
of
us
and
you
may
guess
how
our
hearts
leaped
at
the
sound
and
how
we
watched
with
all
our
ears
for
the
next
gun
that
was
fired
trying
to
make
out
their
bearings
and
distance
as
we
assembled
in
little
knots
upon
the
booms
and
it
was
my
middle
watch
and
i
was
signalman
at
the
time
so
of
course
i
had
no
time
to
take
a
caulk
if
i
was
inclined
when
my
watch
was
over
i
could
not
go
down
to
my
hammock
so
i
kept
the
morning
watch
too
as
did
most
of
the
men
on
board
as
for
nelson
he
walked
the
deck
the
whole
night
quite
in
a
fever
at
daylight
it
was
thick
and
hazy
weather
and
we
could
not
make
them
out
but
about
five
bells
the
old
who
if
she
had
broke
her
nose
had
not
lost
the
use
of
her
eyes
made
the
signal
for
a
part
of
the
spanish
fleet
in
sight
old
jervis
repeated
the
signal
to
prepare
for
action
but
he
might
have
saved
the
wear
and
tear
of
the
bunting
for
we
were
all
ready
down
screens
up
guns
shotted
tackles
rove
yards
slung
powder
filled
shot
on
deck
and
fire
out
and
what
more
mr
simple
i
be
d
d
if
we
were
all
willing
too
about
six
bells
in
the
forenoon
the
fog
and
haze
all
cleared
away
at
once
just
like
the
raising
of
the
foresail
that
they
lower
down
at
the
portsmouth
theatre
and
discovered
the
whole
of
the
spanish
fleet
i
counted
them
all
many
swinburne
cries
nelson
sail
sir
answered
nelson
walked
the
backwards
and
forwards
rubbing
his
hands
and
laughing
to
himself
and
then
he
called
for
his
glass
and
went
to
the
gangway
with
captain
miller
keep
a
good
look
upon
the
admiral
says
he
ay
sir
says
i
now
you
see
mr
simple
sail
against
fifteen
were
great
odds
upon
paper
but
we
did
think
so
because
we
know
the
difference
between
the
two
fleets
there
was
our
fifteen
sail
of
the
line
all
in
order
packed
up
as
close
as
dominoes
and
every
man
on
board
of
them
longing
to
come
to
the
scratch
while
there
was
their
all
two
lines
here
and
there
with
a
great
gap
of
water
in
the
middle
of
them
for
this
gap
between
their
ships
we
all
steered
with
all
the
sail
we
could
carry
because
d
see
mr
simple
by
getting
them
on
both
sides
of
us
we
had
the
advantage
of
fighting
both
broadsides
which
is
just
as
easy
as
fighting
one
and
makes
shorter
work
of
it
just
as
it
struck
seven
bells
troubridge
opened
the
ball
to
half
a
dozen
of
the
spaniards
and
making
them
collins
whether
or
no
bang
bang
bang
bang
oh
mr
simple
a
beautiful
sight
to
see
the
first
guns
fired
that
are
to
bring
on
a
general
action
he
the
luckiest
dog
that
troubridge
said
nelson
stamping
with
impatience
our
ships
were
soon
hard
at
it
hammer
and
tongs
my
eyes
how
they
did
pelt
it
in
and
old
sir
john
in
the
smashed
the
cabin
windows
of
the
spanish
admiral
with
such
a
hell
of
a
raking
broadside
that
the
fellow
bore
up
as
if
the
devil
kicked
him
lord
a
mercy
you
might
have
drove
a
portsmouth
waggon
into
his
starn
the
broadside
of
the
had
made
room
enough
however
they
were
soon
all
smothered
up
in
smoke
and
we
could
not
make
out
how
things
were
going
on
but
we
made
a
pretty
good
guess
well
mr
simple
as
they
say
at
the
play
that
was
act
the
first
scene
the
first
and
now
we
had
to
make
our
appearance
and
i
leave
you
to
judge
after
i
told
my
tale
whether
the
old
was
principal
performer
and
over
them
all
but
stop
a
moment
i
just
look
at
the
binnacle
for
that
young
topman
nodding
at
the
i
say
mr
smith
are
you
shutting
your
eyes
to
keep
them
warm
and
letting
the
ship
run
half
a
point
out
of
her
course
take
care
i
do
send
for
another
helmsman
that
all
and
give
the
reason
why
you
make
a
wry
face
upon
grog
at
seven
bells
d
n
your
eyes
keep
them
open
ca
you
swinburne
after
this
genteel
admonition
to
the
man
at
the
wheel
reseated
himself
and
continued
his
narrative
all
this
while
mr
simple
we
in
the
had
not
fired
a
gun
but
were
ranging
up
as
fast
as
we
could
to
where
the
enemy
lay
in
a
heap
there
were
plenty
to
pick
and
choose
from
and
nelson
looked
out
sharp
for
a
big
one
as
little
boys
do
when
they
have
to
choose
an
apple
and
by
the
piper
that
played
before
moses
it
was
a
big
one
that
he
ordered
the
master
to
put
him
alongside
of
she
was
a
called
the
we
had
to
pass
some
whoppers
which
would
have
satisfied
any
reasonable
man
for
there
was
the
and
del
and
but
nothing
would
suit
nelson
but
this
ship
so
we
crossed
the
hawse
of
about
six
of
them
and
as
soon
as
we
were
abreast
of
her
and
at
the
word
every
gun
went
off
at
once
slap
into
her
and
the
old
reeled
at
the
discharge
as
if
she
was
drunk
i
wish
you
only
seen
how
we
pitched
it
into
this
she
was
enough
before
we
had
done
with
her
riddled
like
a
sieve
several
of
her
ports
knocked
into
one
and
every
scupper
of
her
running
blood
and
water
not
but
what
she
stood
to
it
as
bold
as
brass
and
gave
us
nearly
gun
for
gun
and
made
a
very
pretty
general
average
in
our
ship
company
many
of
the
old
captains
went
to
in
that
business
and
many
more
were
obliged
to
bear
up
for
greenwich
hospital
away
my
lads
steady
aim
cries
nelson
down
there
mr
thomas
pass
the
word
to
reduce
the
cartridges
the
shot
go
clean
through
her
double
shot
the
guns
there
fore
and
aft
so
we
were
at
it
for
about
half
an
hour
when
our
guns
became
so
hot
from
quick
firing
that
they
bounced
up
to
the
beams
overhead
tearing
away
their
ringbolts
and
snapping
their
breechings
like
by
this
time
we
were
almost
as
much
unrigged
as
if
we
had
been
two
days
paying
off
in
portsmouth
harbour
the
forged
ahead
and
troubridge
in
the
jolly
old
came
between
us
and
two
other
spanish
ships
who
were
playing
into
us
she
was
as
fresh
as
a
daisy
and
gave
them
a
dose
which
quite
astonished
them
they
shook
their
ears
and
fell
astern
when
the
laid
hold
of
them
and
mauled
them
so
that
they
went
astern
again
but
it
was
out
of
the
into
the
fire
for
the
prince
and
one
or
two
others
were
coming
up
and
knocked
the
very
guts
out
of
them
i
be
d
d
if
they
forget
the
of
april
and
sarve
them
right
too
was
a
enough
for
any
without
any
more
coming
on
us
and
could
the
beggars
have
matched
themselves
like
gentlemen
well
mr
simple
this
gave
us
a
minute
or
two
to
fetch
our
breath
let
the
guns
cool
and
repair
damages
and
swab
the
blood
from
the
decks
but
we
lost
our
for
we
could
not
get
near
her
again
what
odd
names
the
spaniards
give
to
their
ships
swinburne
why
yes
they
do
it
would
almost
appear
wicked
to
belabour
the
as
we
did
but
why
they
should
call
a
ship
the
seeing
as
how
there
only
three
of
them
father
son
and
holy
ghost
i
ca
tell
bill
saunders
said
that
the
fourth
deck
was
for
the
pope
who
was
as
great
a
personage
as
the
others
but
i
ca
understand
how
that
can
be
well
mr
simple
as
i
was
head
signalman
i
was
perched
on
the
poop
and
did
serve
at
a
gun
i
had
to
report
all
i
could
see
which
was
not
much
the
smoke
was
so
thick
but
now
and
then
i
could
get
a
peep
as
it
were
through
the
holes
in
the
blanket
of
course
i
was
obliged
to
keep
my
eye
as
much
as
possible
upon
the
admiral
not
to
make
out
his
signals
for
commodore
nelson
thank
me
for
that
i
knew
he
hated
a
signal
when
in
action
so
i
never
took
no
notice
of
the
bunting
but
just
watched
to
see
what
he
was
about
so
while
we
are
repairing
damages
i
just
tell
you
what
i
saw
of
the
rest
of
the
fleet
as
soon
as
old
jervis
had
done
for
the
spanish
admiral
he
hauled
his
wind
on
the
larboard
tack
and
followed
by
four
or
five
other
ships
weathered
the
spanish
line
and
joined
collingwood
in
the
then
they
all
dashed
through
the
line
the
was
the
leading
ship
and
she
first
took
the
shine
out
of
the
del
and
then
left
her
to
be
picked
up
by
the
other
ships
while
she
attacked
a
who
hauled
down
her
colours
i
forget
her
name
just
now
as
soon
as
the
ran
alongside
of
the
del
down
went
her
colours
and
reasons
had
she
for
striking
her
flag
and
now
mr
simple
the
old
comes
into
play
again
having
parted
company
with
the
we
had
recommenced
action
with
the
a
spanish
eighty
and
while
we
were
hard
at
it
old
collingwood
comes
up
in
the
the
knowing
that
the
broadside
would
send
her
to
old
nick
put
her
helm
up
to
avoid
being
raked
in
so
doing
she
fell
foul
of
the
a
spanish
and
we
being
all
cut
to
pieces
and
unmanageable
all
of
us
indeed
reeling
about
like
drunken
men
nelson
ordered
his
helm
and
in
a
jiffy
there
we
were
all
three
hugging
each
other
running
in
one
another
guns
smashing
our
and
poking
our
through
each
other
canvas
hands
to
board
roared
nelson
leaping
on
the
hammocks
and
waving
his
sword
hurrah
echoed
through
the
decks
and
up
flew
the
men
like
as
many
angry
bees
out
of
a
in
a
moment
pikes
tomahawks
cutlasses
and
pistols
were
seized
for
it
was
quite
unexpected
mr
simple
and
our
men
poured
into
the
ship
and
in
two
minutes
the
decks
were
cleared
and
all
the
dons
pitched
below
i
joined
the
boarders
and
was
on
the
main
deck
when
captain
miller
came
down
and
cried
out
deck
again
immediately
up
we
went
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
for
mr
simple
why
to
board
a
second
time
for
nelson
having
taken
the
swore
that
he
have
the
as
well
so
away
we
went
again
clambering
up
her
lofty
sides
how
we
could
and
dropping
down
on
her
decks
like
hailstones
we
all
made
for
the
beat
down
every
spanish
beggar
that
showed
fight
and
in
five
minutes
more
we
had
hauled
down
the
colours
of
two
of
the
finest
ships
in
the
spanish
navy
if
that
was
taking
the
shine
out
of
the
dons
i
should
like
to
know
what
is
and
did
the
old
captains
cheer
and
shake
hands
as
commodore
nelson
stood
on
the
deck
of
the
and
received
the
swords
of
the
spanish
officers
there
was
enough
of
them
to
go
right
round
the
capstern
and
plenty
to
spare
now
mr
simple
what
do
you
think
of
that
for
a
spree
why
swinburne
i
can
only
say
that
i
wish
i
had
been
there
so
did
every
man
in
the
fleet
mr
simple
i
can
tell
you
but
what
became
of
the
upon
my
word
she
behaved
one
better
than
all
the
others
she
held
out
against
four
of
our
ships
for
a
long
while
and
then
hauled
down
her
colours
and
no
disgrace
to
her
considering
what
a
precious
hammering
she
had
taken
first
but
the
lee
division
of
the
spanish
weather
fleet
if
i
may
so
call
it
consisting
of
eleven
sail
of
the
line
came
up
to
her
assistance
and
surrounded
her
so
that
they
got
her
off
our
ships
were
too
much
cut
up
to
commence
a
new
action
and
the
admiral
made
the
signal
to
secure
the
prizes
the
spanish
fleet
then
did
what
they
should
have
done
before
got
into
line
and
we
lost
no
time
in
doing
the
same
but
we
both
had
had
fighting
enough
but
do
you
think
swinburne
that
the
spaniards
fought
well
they
have
fought
better
if
they
only
have
known
how
there
no
want
of
courage
in
the
dons
mr
simple
but
they
did
not
support
each
other
only
observe
how
troubridge
supported
us
by
god
mr
simple
he
was
the
and
nelson
knew
it
well
he
was
man
but
you
know
there
was
room
for
nelsons
their
ships
engaged
held
out
well
it
must
be
acknowledged
but
why
they
all
in
their
proper
berths
had
they
kept
close
order
of
sailing
and
had
all
fought
as
well
as
those
who
were
captured
it
would
not
have
been
a
very
easy
matter
for
fifteen
ships
to
gain
a
victory
over
that
long
odds
even
when
backed
with
british
seamen
well
how
did
you
separate
why
the
next
morning
the
spaniards
had
the
weathergage
so
they
had
the
option
whether
to
fight
or
not
at
one
time
they
had
half
a
mind
for
they
bore
down
to
us
upon
which
we
hauled
our
wind
to
show
them
we
were
all
ready
to
meet
them
and
then
they
thought
better
of
it
and
again
so
as
they
would
fight
and
we
did
wish
it
we
parted
company
in
the
night
and
two
days
afterwards
we
anchored
with
our
four
prizes
in
lagos
bay
so
now
you
have
the
whole
of
it
mr
simple
and
i
talked
till
i
quite
hoarse
you
have
by
chance
another
drop
of
the
stuff
left
to
clear
my
throat
it
would
be
quite
a
charity
i
think
i
have
swinburne
and
as
you
deserve
it
i
will
go
and
fetch
it
chapter
xxxvi
a
letter
from
father
who
diplomatizes
when
priest
meets
priest
then
comes
the
tug
of
war
father
not
to
be
made
a
tool
of
we
continued
our
cruise
for
a
fortnight
and
then
made
sail
for
jamaica
where
we
found
the
admiral
at
anchor
at
port
royal
but
our
signal
was
made
to
keep
under
weigh
and
captain
kearney
having
paid
his
respects
to
the
admiral
received
orders
to
carry
despatches
to
halifax
water
and
provisions
were
sent
on
board
by
the
boats
of
the
admiral
ships
and
to
our
great
disappointment
as
the
evening
closed
in
we
were
again
standing
out
to
sea
instead
of
as
we
had
anticipated
enjoying
ourselves
on
shore
but
the
fact
was
that
orders
had
arrived
from
england
to
send
a
frigate
immediately
up
to
the
admiral
at
halifax
to
be
at
his
disposal
i
had
however
the
satisfaction
to
know
that
captain
kearney
had
been
true
to
his
word
in
making
mention
of
my
name
in
the
despatch
for
the
clerk
showed
me
a
copy
of
it
nothing
occurred
worth
mentioning
during
our
passage
except
that
captain
kearney
was
very
unwell
nearly
the
whole
of
the
time
and
seldom
quitted
his
cabin
it
was
in
october
that
we
anchored
in
halifax
harbour
and
the
admiralty
expecting
our
arrival
there
had
forwarded
our
letters
there
were
none
for
me
but
there
was
one
for
from
father
the
contents
of
which
were
as
follows
my
dear
son
and
a
good
son
you
are
and
that
the
truth
on
it
or
devil
a
bit
should
you
be
a
son
of
mine
you
made
your
family
quite
contented
and
peaceable
and
they
never
fight
for
the
now
good
reason
why
they
should
seeing
that
there
a
plenty
for
all
of
them
and
the
pig
craturs
into
the
bargain
your
father
and
your
mother
and
your
brother
and
your
three
sisters
send
their
duty
to
you
and
their
blessings
too
and
you
may
add
my
blessing
terence
which
is
worth
them
all
for
wo
i
get
you
out
of
purgatory
in
the
twinkling
of
a
make
yourself
quite
aisy
on
that
score
and
lave
it
all
to
me
only
just
say
a
now
and
then
that
when
st
peter
lets
you
in
he
may
throw
it
in
your
teeth
that
you
saved
your
soul
by
contract
which
is
the
only
way
by
which
emperors
and
kings
ever
get
to
heaven
your
letter
from
plymouth
came
safe
to
hand
barney
the
having
dropped
it
under
foot
close
to
our
door
the
big
pig
took
it
into
his
mouth
and
ran
away
with
it
but
i
caught
sight
of
him
and
to
him
he
let
it
go
knowing
the
cratur
that
i
could
read
it
better
than
him
as
soon
as
i
had
digested
the
contents
which
it
was
lucky
the
pig
did
not
instead
of
me
i
just
took
my
meal
and
my
big
stick
and
then
set
off
for
ballycleuch
now
you
know
terence
if
you
have
forgot
and
if
you
have
just
remind
you
that
there
a
flaunty
sort
of
young
woman
at
the
poteen
shop
there
who
calls
herself
mrs
wife
to
a
corporal
who
was
kilt
or
died
one
day
i
do
know
which
but
not
of
much
consequence
the
devil
a
bit
do
i
think
the
priest
ever
gave
the
to
that
same
although
she
swears
that
she
was
married
on
the
rock
of
gibraltar
it
may
be
a
strong
rock
fore
i
know
but
it
not
the
rock
of
salvation
like
the
seven
sacraments
of
which
marriage
is
one
mrs
is
a
little
too
apt
to
fleer
and
jeer
at
the
priests
and
if
it
were
not
that
she
softens
down
her
pertinent
remarks
with
a
glass
or
two
of
the
real
poteen
which
proves
some
respect
for
the
church
i
excommunicate
her
body
and
soul
and
every
body
and
every
soul
that
put
their
lips
to
the
cratur
at
her
door
but
she
must
leave
that
off
as
i
tell
her
when
she
gets
old
and
ugly
for
then
all
the
whisky
in
the
world
save
her
but
she
a
fine
woman
now
and
it
goes
agin
my
conscience
to
help
the
devil
to
a
fine
woman
now
this
mrs
knows
everybody
and
everything
that
going
on
in
the
country
about
and
she
has
a
tongue
which
has
never
had
a
holiday
since
it
was
let
loose
morning
to
ye
mrs
says
i
the
top
of
the
morning
to
you
father
says
she
with
a
smile
brings
you
here
is
it
a
journey
that
you
taking
to
buy
the
true
wood
of
the
cross
or
is
it
a
purty
girl
that
you
wish
to
confess
father
or
is
it
only
that
you
come
for
a
drop
of
poteen
and
a
little
bit
of
chat
with
mrs
it
i
who
be
glad
to
find
the
same
true
wood
of
the
cross
mrs
but
it
not
grown
i
suspect
at
your
town
of
ballycleuch
and
it
no
objection
i
have
to
confess
a
purty
girl
like
yourself
mrs
who
only
tell
me
half
her
sins
and
give
me
no
trouble
but
it
the
truth
that
i
here
for
nothing
else
but
to
have
a
bit
of
chat
with
yourself
dainty
dear
and
taste
your
poteen
just
by
way
of
keeping
my
mouth
nate
and
clane
so
mrs
poured
out
the
real
stuff
which
i
drank
to
her
health
and
then
says
i
putting
down
the
bit
of
a
glass
you
a
stranger
come
i
find
in
your
parts
mrs
heard
the
same
replied
she
so
you
observe
terence
i
came
to
the
fact
all
at
once
by
a
guess
am
tould
says
i
he
a
scotchman
and
spakes
what
nobody
can
understand
a
bit
says
she
an
englishman
and
speaks
plain
enough
what
can
a
man
mane
to
come
here
and
sit
down
all
alone
says
i
alone
father
replied
she
a
man
all
alone
when
got
his
wife
and
childer
and
more
coming
with
the
blessing
of
god
those
boys
are
not
his
own
childer
i
believe
says
i
again
you
all
in
a
mistake
father
rejoins
she
childer
are
all
his
own
and
all
girls
to
boot
it
appears
that
it
just
as
well
that
you
come
down
now
and
then
for
information
to
our
town
of
ballycleuch
true
mrs
says
i
who
is
it
that
knows
everything
so
well
as
yourself
you
observe
terence
that
i
just
said
everything
contrary
and
as
they
call
it
to
the
contents
of
your
letter
for
always
recollect
my
son
that
if
you
would
worm
a
secret
out
of
a
woman
you
do
more
by
contradiction
than
you
ever
will
by
coaxing
so
i
went
on
i
think
it
a
burning
shame
mrs
for
a
gentleman
to
bring
over
with
him
here
from
england
a
parcel
of
lazy
english
servants
when
there
so
many
nice
boys
and
girls
here
to
attind
upon
them
there
you
all
wrong
again
father
says
she
a
soul
has
he
brought
from
the
other
country
but
has
hired
them
all
here
ar
there
ella
flanagan
for
one
maid
and
terence
driscol
for
a
footman
and
it
well
that
he
looks
in
his
new
uniform
when
he
comes
down
for
the
newspapers
and
ar
moggy
cala
there
to
cook
the
dinner
and
pretty
mary
sullivan
for
a
nurse
for
the
babby
as
soon
as
it
comes
into
the
world
it
mary
sullivan
you
mane
says
i
that
was
married
about
three
months
back
and
is
so
quick
in
that
she
all
but
ready
to
fall
to
pieces
in
this
same
time
exactly
she
says
mrs
do
you
know
the
reason
a
bit
says
i
should
i
it
just
that
she
may
send
her
own
child
away
and
give
her
milk
to
the
english
babby
that
coming
because
the
lady
is
too
much
of
a
lady
to
have
a
child
hanging
to
her
breast
suppose
mary
sullivan
child
born
till
afterwards
how
then
says
i
mrs
for
you
a
sensible
woman
then
says
she
that
all
arranged
for
mary
says
that
she
be
in
bed
a
week
before
the
lady
so
that
all
right
perceive
father
do
you
perceive
sensible
woman
as
you
are
that
a
young
woman
who
is
so
much
out
of
her
reckoning
as
to
have
a
child
three
months
after
her
marriage
may
make
a
little
mistake
in
her
arithmetic
mrs
fear
father
mary
sullivan
will
keep
her
word
and
sooner
than
disappoint
the
lady
and
lose
her
place
she
just
tumble
and
wo
that
put
her
to
bed
fast
enough
that
what
i
call
a
faithful
good
servant
that
earns
her
wages
says
i
now
i
just
take
another
glass
mrs
and
thank
you
too
sure
you
the
woman
that
knows
everything
and
a
mighty
pretty
woman
into
the
bargain
me
alone
now
father
and
do
be
pinching
me
that
way
anyhow
was
only
a
big
flea
that
i
perceived
hopping
on
your
gown
my
darling
devil
anything
else
thanks
to
you
father
for
that
same
but
the
next
time
kill
my
fleas
just
wait
until
they
in
a
situation
are
fleas
mrs
and
we
must
catch
when
we
can
and
how
we
can
and
as
we
can
so
no
offence
a
good
night
rest
to
you
mrs
when
do
you
mean
to
confess
an
idea
that
i
too
many
fleas
about
me
to
confess
to
you
just
now
father
and
that
the
truth
on
it
so
a
pleasant
walk
back
to
you
so
you
perceive
my
son
that
having
got
all
the
information
from
mrs
it
back
i
went
to
ballyhinch
till
i
heard
it
whispered
that
there
were
doings
down
at
the
old
house
at
ballycleuch
off
i
set
and
went
to
the
house
itself
as
priests
always
ought
to
be
welcomed
at
births
and
marriages
and
deaths
being
as
you
know
of
great
use
on
such
occasions
when
who
should
open
the
door
but
father
the
biggest
rapparee
of
a
priest
in
the
whole
of
ireland
did
he
steal
a
horse
and
only
save
his
neck
by
benefit
of
clergy
and
did
he
ever
give
absolution
to
a
young
woman
without
making
her
sin
over
again
may
be
your
pleasure
here
father
says
he
holding
the
door
with
his
hand
just
to
call
and
hear
what
going
on
the
matter
of
that
says
he
just
tell
you
that
we
all
going
on
very
well
but
you
ashamed
of
yourself
father
to
come
here
to
interfere
with
my
flock
knowing
that
i
confess
the
house
altogether
as
may
be
says
i
i
only
wanted
to
know
what
the
lady
had
brought
into
the
world
a
says
he
says
i
thanks
for
the
information
and
pray
what
is
it
that
mary
sullivan
has
brought
into
the
world
a
too
says
he
now
that
you
know
all
about
it
good
evening
to
you
father
and
the
ugly
brute
slammed
the
door
right
in
my
face
stole
a
horse
cries
i
but
he
did
hear
me
more
the
pity
so
you
perceive
my
dear
boy
that
i
have
found
out
something
at
all
events
but
not
so
much
as
i
intended
for
i
prove
to
father
that
he
no
match
for
father
but
what
i
find
out
must
be
reserved
for
another
letter
seeing
that
it
not
possible
to
tell
it
to
you
in
this
same
praties
look
well
but
somehow
or
another
do
grow
upon
trees
in
ould
ireland
and
one
of
your
bills
or
a
little
if
it
found
its
way
here
would
add
not
a
little
to
the
respectability
of
the
family
appearance
even
my
cassock
is
becoming
too
for
a
parish
priest
not
that
i
care
about
it
so
much
only
father
the
baste
had
on
a
bran
new
one
not
that
i
believe
that
he
ever
came
honestly
by
it
as
i
have
by
mine
but
get
it
how
you
may
a
new
gown
always
looks
better
than
an
old
one
that
certain
so
no
more
at
present
from
your
loving
friend
and
confessor
urtagh
now
you
observe
peter
said
after
i
had
read
the
letter
that
as
i
supposed
your
uncle
meant
mischief
when
he
went
over
to
ireland
whether
the
children
are
both
boys
or
both
girls
or
your
uncle
is
a
boy
and
the
other
is
a
girl
there
is
no
knowing
at
present
if
an
exchange
was
required
it
made
that
certain
but
i
will
write
again
to
father
and
insist
upon
his
finding
out
the
truth
if
possible
have
you
any
letter
from
your
father
none
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
wish
i
had
for
he
would
not
have
failed
to
speak
on
the
subject
well
never
mind
it
no
use
dreaming
over
the
matter
we
must
do
our
best
when
we
get
to
england
ourselves
and
in
the
meantime
trust
to
father
i
go
and
write
to
him
while
my
mind
full
of
it
wrote
his
letter
and
the
subject
was
not
started
again
chapter
xxxvii
captain
kearney
illness
he
makes
his
will
and
devises
sundry
châteaux
en
espagne
for
the
benefit
of
those
concerned
the
legacy
duty
in
this
instance
not
ruinous
he
signs
seals
and
dies
the
captain
as
was
his
custom
went
on
shore
and
took
up
his
quarters
at
a
friend
house
that
is
to
say
the
house
of
an
acquaintance
or
any
polite
gentleman
who
would
ask
him
to
take
a
dinner
and
a
bed
this
was
quite
sufficient
for
captain
kearney
who
would
fill
his
portmanteau
and
take
up
his
quarters
without
thinking
of
leaving
them
until
the
ship
sailed
or
some
more
advantageous
invitation
was
given
this
conduct
in
england
would
have
very
much
trespassed
on
our
ideas
of
hospitality
but
in
our
foreign
settlements
and
colonies
where
the
society
is
confined
and
novelty
is
desirable
a
person
who
could
amuse
like
captain
kearney
was
generally
welcome
let
him
stay
as
long
as
he
pleased
all
sailors
agree
in
asserting
that
halifax
is
one
of
the
most
delightful
ports
in
which
a
ship
can
anchor
everybody
is
hospitable
cheerful
and
willing
to
amuse
and
be
amused
it
is
therefore
a
very
bad
place
to
send
a
ship
to
if
you
wish
her
to
refit
in
a
hurry
unless
indeed
the
admiral
is
there
to
watch
over
your
daily
progress
and
a
sharp
commissioner
to
expedite
your
motions
in
the
dockyard
the
admiral
was
there
when
we
arrived
and
we
should
not
have
lain
there
long
had
not
the
health
of
captain
kearney
by
the
time
that
we
were
ready
for
sea
been
so
seriously
affected
that
the
doctor
was
of
opinion
that
he
could
not
sail
another
frigate
was
sent
to
our
intended
and
we
lay
idle
in
port
but
we
consoled
ourselves
if
we
did
not
make
at
all
events
we
were
very
happy
and
the
major
part
of
the
officers
very
much
in
love
we
had
remained
in
halifax
harbour
about
three
weeks
when
a
very
great
change
for
the
worse
took
place
in
captain
kearney
disease
disease
indeed
it
could
hardly
be
called
he
had
been
long
suffering
from
the
insidious
attacks
of
a
hot
climate
and
though
repeatedly
advised
to
invalid
he
never
would
consent
his
constitution
appeared
now
to
be
breaking
up
in
a
few
days
he
was
so
ill
that
at
the
request
of
the
naval
surgeons
he
consented
to
be
removed
to
the
hospital
where
he
could
command
more
comforts
than
in
any
private
house
he
had
not
been
at
the
hospital
more
than
two
days
when
he
sent
for
me
and
stated
his
wish
that
i
should
remain
with
him
you
know
peter
that
you
are
a
cousin
of
mine
and
one
likes
to
have
one
relations
near
one
when
we
are
sick
so
bring
your
traps
on
shore
the
doctor
has
promised
me
a
nice
little
room
for
yourself
and
you
shall
come
and
sit
with
me
all
day
i
certainly
had
no
objection
to
remain
with
him
because
i
considered
it
my
duty
so
to
do
and
i
must
say
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
me
to
make
any
effort
to
entertain
him
as
he
always
entertained
me
but
i
could
not
help
seriously
reflecting
and
feeling
much
shocked
at
a
man
lying
in
so
dangerous
a
state
for
the
doctors
had
pronounced
his
recovery
to
be
impossible
still
continuing
a
system
of
falsehood
during
the
whole
day
without
intermission
but
it
really
appeared
in
him
to
be
innate
and
as
swinburne
said
if
he
told
truth
it
was
entirely
by
mistake
peter
said
he
one
day
there
a
great
draught
shut
the
door
and
put
on
some
more
coals
the
fire
does
not
draw
well
sir
replied
i
without
the
door
is
open
it
astonishing
how
little
people
understand
the
nature
of
these
things
when
i
built
my
house
called
walcot
abbey
there
was
not
a
chimney
would
draw
i
sent
for
the
architect
and
abused
him
but
he
could
not
manage
it
i
was
obliged
to
do
it
myself
did
you
manage
it
sir
manage
it
i
think
i
did
the
first
time
i
lighted
the
fire
i
opened
the
door
and
the
draught
was
so
great
that
my
little
boy
william
who
was
standing
in
the
current
of
air
would
have
gone
right
up
the
chimney
if
i
had
not
caught
him
by
the
petticoats
as
it
was
his
frock
was
on
fire
why
sir
it
must
have
been
as
bad
as
a
hurricane
no
no
not
quite
so
bad
but
it
showed
what
a
little
knowledge
of
philosophical
arrangement
could
effect
we
have
no
hurricanes
in
england
peter
but
i
have
seen
a
very
pretty
whirlwind
when
i
was
at
walcot
abbey
indeed
sir
yes
it
cut
four
square
haystacks
quite
round
and
i
lost
twenty
tons
of
hay
it
twisted
the
iron
at
the
entrance
just
as
a
porpoise
twists
a
harpoon
and
took
up
a
sow
and
her
litter
of
pigs
that
were
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
back
of
the
house
and
landed
them
safe
over
the
house
to
the
front
with
the
exception
of
the
old
sow
putting
her
shoulder
out
indeed
sir
yes
but
what
was
strange
there
were
a
great
many
rats
in
the
hayrick
and
up
they
went
with
the
hay
now
peter
by
the
laws
of
gravitation
they
naturally
come
down
before
the
hay
and
i
was
walking
with
my
greyhound
or
rather
terrier
and
after
one
coming
down
close
to
her
which
she
killed
it
was
quite
ridiculous
to
witness
her
looking
up
in
the
air
and
watching
for
the
others
a
greyhound
did
you
say
sir
or
a
terrier
both
peter
the
fact
is
she
had
been
a
greyhound
but
breaking
her
foreleg
against
a
stump
when
coursing
i
had
the
other
three
amputated
as
well
and
then
she
made
a
capital
terrier
she
was
a
great
favourite
of
mine
well
observed
i
i
have
read
something
like
that
in
baron
munchausen
mr
simple
said
the
captain
turning
on
his
elbow
and
looking
me
severely
in
the
face
what
do
you
mean
to
imply
oh
nothing
sir
but
i
have
read
a
story
of
that
kind
most
probably
the
great
art
of
invention
is
to
found
it
upon
facts
there
are
some
people
who
out
of
a
will
make
a
mountain
and
facts
and
fiction
become
so
blended
nowadays
that
even
truth
becomes
a
matter
of
doubt
very
true
sir
replied
i
and
as
he
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
i
ventured
to
bring
my
bible
to
his
bedside
as
if
i
was
reading
it
to
myself
what
are
you
reading
peter
said
he
only
a
chapter
in
the
bible
sir
said
i
would
you
like
that
i
should
read
aloud
yes
i
very
fond
of
the
bible
it
the
book
of
peter
read
me
about
jacob
and
his
weathering
esau
with
a
mess
of
pottage
and
obtaining
his
father
blessing
i
could
not
help
thinking
it
singular
that
he
should
select
a
portion
in
which
for
divine
reasons
a
lie
was
crowned
with
success
and
reward
when
i
had
finished
it
he
asked
me
to
read
something
more
i
turned
over
to
the
acts
of
the
apostles
and
commenced
the
chapter
in
which
ananias
and
sapphira
were
struck
dead
when
i
had
finished
he
observed
very
seriously
that
is
a
very
good
lesson
for
young
people
peter
and
points
out
that
you
never
should
swerve
from
the
truth
recollect
as
your
motto
peter
to
truth
and
shame
the
devil
after
this
observation
i
laid
down
the
book
as
it
appeared
to
me
that
he
was
quite
unaware
of
his
propensity
and
without
a
sense
of
your
fault
how
can
repentance
and
amendment
be
expected
he
became
more
feeble
and
exhausted
every
day
and
at
last
was
so
weak
that
he
could
scarcely
raise
himself
in
his
bed
one
afternoon
he
said
peter
i
shall
make
my
will
not
that
i
am
going
to
kick
the
bucket
just
yet
but
still
it
is
every
man
duty
to
set
his
house
in
order
and
it
will
amuse
me
so
fetch
pen
and
paper
and
come
and
sit
down
by
me
i
did
as
he
requested
write
peter
that
i
anthony
george
william
charles
huskisson
kearney
my
father
name
was
anthony
peter
i
was
christened
george
after
the
present
regent
william
and
charles
after
mr
pitt
and
mr
fox
who
were
my
sponsors
huskisson
is
the
name
of
my
great
uncle
whose
property
devolves
to
me
he
now
so
he
ca
last
long
have
you
written
down
that
yes
sir
being
in
sound
mind
do
hereby
make
my
last
will
and
testament
revoking
all
former
wills
yes
sir
i
bequeath
to
my
dearly
beloved
wife
augusta
charlotte
kearney
she
was
named
after
the
queen
and
princess
augusta
who
held
her
at
the
baptismal
font
all
my
household
furniture
books
pictures
plate
and
houses
for
her
own
free
use
and
will
and
to
dispose
of
at
her
pleasure
upon
her
demise
is
that
down
yes
sir
also
the
interest
of
all
my
money
in
the
three
percents
reduced
and
in
the
long
annuities
and
the
balance
in
my
agent
hands
for
her
natural
life
at
her
death
to
be
divided
into
equal
portions
between
my
two
children
william
mohamed
potemkin
kearney
and
caroline
anastasia
kearney
is
that
down
yes
sir
well
then
peter
now
for
my
real
property
my
estate
in
kent
let
me
see
what
is
the
name
of
it
walcot
abbey
my
three
farms
in
the
vale
of
aylesbury
and
the
marsh
lands
in
norfolk
i
bequeath
to
my
two
children
aforenamed
the
proceeds
of
the
same
to
be
laid
up
deducting
all
necessary
expenses
for
their
education
for
their
sole
use
and
benefit
is
that
down
not
yet
sir
and
benefit
now
it
is
sir
until
they
come
to
the
age
of
years
or
in
case
of
my
daughter
until
she
marries
with
the
consent
of
my
executors
then
to
be
equally
and
fairly
valued
and
divided
between
them
you
observe
peter
i
never
make
any
difference
between
girls
and
boys
a
good
father
will
leave
one
child
as
much
as
another
now
i
take
my
breath
a
little
i
was
really
astonished
it
was
well
known
that
captain
kearney
had
nothing
but
his
pay
and
that
it
was
the
hopes
of
to
support
his
family
which
had
induced
him
to
stay
out
so
long
in
the
west
indies
it
was
laughable
yet
i
could
not
laugh
there
was
a
melancholy
feeling
at
such
a
specimen
of
insanity
which
prevented
me
now
peter
we
go
on
said
captain
kearney
after
a
pause
of
a
few
minutes
i
have
a
few
legacies
to
bequeath
first
to
all
my
servants
each
and
two
suits
of
mourning
to
my
nephew
thomas
kearney
of
kearney
hall
yorkshire
i
bequeath
the
sword
presented
me
by
the
grand
sultan
i
promised
it
to
him
and
although
we
have
quarrelled
and
not
spoken
for
years
i
always
keep
my
word
the
plate
presented
me
by
the
merchants
and
underwriters
of
lloyd
i
leave
to
my
worthy
friend
the
duke
of
newcastle
is
that
down
yes
sir

presented
me
by
prince
potemkin

him
from
the
mortgage
which
i
hold
over
his
property
of
the
madeline
islands
in
north
america
say
and
further
i
bequeath
to
him
the
bag
of
snuff
presented
to
me
by
the
dey
of
algiers
he
may
as
well
have
the
snuff
as
he
has
the
is
that
down
yes
sir
well
then
now
peter
i
must
leave
you
something
oh
never
mind
me
replied
i
no
no
peter
i
must
not
forget
my
cousin
let
me
see
you
shall
have
my
fighting
sword
a
real
good
one
i
can
tell
you
i
once
fought
a
duel
with
it
at
palermo
and
ran
a
sicilian
prince
so
clean
through
the
body
and
it
held
so
tight
that
we
were
obliged
to
send
for
a
pair
of
to
pull
it
out
again
put
that
down
as
a
legacy
for
my
cousin
peter
simple
i
believe
that
is
all
now
for
my
executors
and
i
request
my
particular
friends
the
earl
of
londonderry
the
marquis
of
chandos
and
mr
john
lubbock
banker
to
be
my
executors
and
leave
each
of
them
the
sum
of
one
thousand
pounds
for
their
trouble
and
in
token
of
regard
that
will
do
peter
now
as
i
have
left
so
much
real
property
it
is
necessary
that
there
should
be
three
witnesses
so
call
in
two
more
and
let
me
sign
in
your
presence
this
order
was
obeyed
and
this
strange
will
duly
attested
for
i
hardly
need
say
that
even
the
presents
he
had
pretended
to
receive
were
purchased
by
himself
at
different
times
but
such
was
the
force
of
his
ruling
passion
even
to
the
last
mr
phillott
and
used
to
come
and
see
him
as
did
occasionally
some
of
the
other
officers
and
he
was
always
cheerful
and
merry
and
seemed
to
be
quite
indifferent
about
his
situation
although
fully
aware
of
it
his
stories
if
anything
became
more
marvellous
as
no
one
ventured
to
express
a
doubt
as
to
their
credibility
i
had
remained
in
the
hospital
about
a
week
when
captain
kearney
was
evidently
dying
the
doctor
came
felt
his
pulse
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
he
could
not
outlive
the
day
this
was
on
a
friday
and
there
certainly
was
every
symptom
of
dissolution
he
was
so
exhausted
that
he
could
scarcely
articulate
his
feet
were
cold
and
his
eyes
appeared
glazed
and
turned
upwards
the
doctor
remained
an
hour
felt
his
pulse
again
shook
his
head
and
said
to
me
in
a
low
voice
he
is
quite
gone
as
soon
as
the
doctor
quitted
the
room
captain
kearney
opened
his
eyes
and
beckoned
me
to
him
he
a
confounded
fool
peter
said
he
he
thinks
i
am
slipping
my
wind
now
but
i
know
better
going
i
am
is
true
but
i
sha
die
till
next
thursday
strange
to
say
from
that
moment
he
rallied
and
although
it
was
reported
that
he
was
dead
and
the
admiral
had
signed
the
acting
order
for
his
successor
the
next
morning
to
the
astonishment
of
everybody
captain
kearney
was
still
alive
he
continued
in
this
state
between
life
and
death
until
the
thursday
next
the
day
on
which
he
asserted
that
he
would
die
and
on
that
morning
he
was
evidently
sinking
fast
towards
noon
his
breathing
became
much
oppressed
and
irregular
and
he
was
evidently
dying
the
rattle
in
his
throat
commenced
and
i
watched
at
his
bedside
waiting
for
his
last
gasp
when
he
again
opened
his
eyes
and
beckoning
me
with
an
effort
to
put
my
head
close
to
him
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
he
contrived
in
a
sort
of
gurgling
whisper
and
with
much
difficulty
to
utter
peter
i
going
now
not
that
the
rattle
in
my
throat
is
a
sign
of
death
for
i
once
knew
a
man
to
with
rattle
in
his
for
he
fell
back
and
expired
having
perhaps
at
his
last
gasp
told
the
greatest
lie
of
his
whole
life
thus
died
this
most
extraordinary
character
who
in
most
other
points
commanded
respect
he
was
a
kind
man
and
a
good
officer
but
from
the
idiosyncrasy
of
his
disposition
whether
from
habit
or
from
nature
could
not
speak
the
truth
i
say
from
because
i
have
witnessed
the
vice
of
stealing
equally
strong
and
never
to
be
eradicated
it
was
in
a
young
messmate
of
good
family
and
who
was
supplied
with
money
to
almost
any
extent
he
was
one
of
the
most
generous
lads
that
i
ever
knew
he
would
offer
his
purse
or
the
contents
of
his
chest
to
any
of
his
messmates
and
at
the
same
time
would
steal
everything
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
upon
i
have
known
him
watch
for
hours
to
steal
what
could
be
of
no
use
to
him
as
for
instance
an
shoe
and
that
much
too
small
for
his
foot
what
he
stole
he
would
give
away
the
very
next
day
but
to
check
it
was
impossible
it
was
so
well
known
that
if
anything
was
missed
we
used
first
to
apply
to
his
chest
to
see
if
it
was
there
and
usually
found
the
article
in
question
he
appeared
to
be
wholly
insensible
to
shame
upon
this
subject
though
in
every
other
he
showed
no
want
of
feeling
or
of
honour
and
strange
to
say
he
never
covered
his
theft
with
a
lie
after
vain
attempts
to
cure
him
of
this
propensity
he
was
dismissed
the
service
as
incorrigible
captain
kearney
was
buried
in
the
churchyard
with
the
usual
military
honours
in
his
desk
we
found
directions
in
his
own
hand
relative
to
his
funeral
and
the
engraving
on
his
tombstone
in
these
he
stated
his
aged
to
be
years
if
this
was
correct
captain
kearney
from
the
time
that
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
his
country
must
have
entered
the
navy
just
months
he
was
born
it
was
unfortunate
that
he
commenced
the
inscription
with
here
lies
captain
kearney
his
tombstone
had
not
been
set
up
hours
before
somebody
who
knew
his
character
put
a
dash
under
one
word
as
emphatic
as
it
was
true
of
the
living
man
here
captain
chapter
xxxviii
captain
horton
gloomy
news
from
home
get
over
head
and
ears
in
the
water
and
find
myself
afterwards
growing
one
way
and
my
clothes
another
though
neither
as
rich
as
a
jew
nor
as
large
as
a
camel
i
pass
through
my
examination
which
my
brother
candidates
think
passing
strange
the
day
after
captain
kearney
decease
his
acting
successor
made
his
appearance
on
board
the
character
of
captain
horton
was
well
known
to
us
from
the
complaints
made
by
the
officers
belonging
to
his
ship
of
his
apathy
and
indolence
indeed
he
went
by
the
of
the
sloth
it
certainly
was
very
annoying
to
his
officers
to
witness
so
many
opportunities
of
and
distinction
thrown
away
through
the
indolence
of
his
disposition
captain
horton
was
a
young
man
of
family
who
had
advanced
rapidly
in
the
service
from
interest
and
from
occasionally
distinguishing
himself
in
the
several
expeditions
on
which
he
had
not
volunteered
but
had
been
ordered
he
had
shown
not
only
courage
but
a
remarkable
degree
of
coolness
in
danger
and
difficulty
which
had
gained
him
much
approbation
but
it
was
said
that
this
coolness
arose
from
his
very
fault
an
unaccountable
laziness
he
would
walk
away
as
it
were
from
the
enemy
fire
when
others
would
hasten
merely
because
he
was
so
apathetic
that
he
would
not
exert
himself
to
run
in
one
expedition
in
which
he
distinguished
himself
it
is
said
that
having
to
board
a
very
high
vessel
and
that
in
a
shower
of
grape
and
musketry
when
the
boat
dashed
alongside
and
the
men
were
springing
up
he
looked
up
at
the
height
of
the
vessel
sides
and
exclaimed
with
a
look
of
despair
my
god
must
we
really
climb
up
that
vessel
decks
when
he
had
gained
the
deck
and
became
excited
he
then
proved
how
little
fear
had
to
do
with
the
remark
the
captain
of
the
ship
falling
by
his
hand
as
he
fought
in
advance
on
his
own
men
but
this
peculiarity
which
in
a
junior
officer
was
of
little
consequence
and
a
subject
of
mirth
in
a
captain
became
of
a
very
serious
nature
the
admiral
was
aware
how
often
he
had
neglected
to
annoy
or
capture
the
enemy
when
he
might
have
done
it
and
by
such
neglect
captain
horton
infringed
one
of
the
articles
of
war
the
punishment
awarded
to
which
infringement
is
his
appointment
therefore
to
the
was
as
annoying
to
us
as
his
quitting
his
former
ship
was
agreeable
to
those
on
board
of
her
as
it
happened
it
proved
of
little
consequence
the
admiral
had
instructions
from
home
to
advance
captain
horton
to
the
first
vacancy
which
of
course
he
was
obliged
to
comply
with
but
not
wishing
to
keep
on
the
station
an
officer
who
would
not
exert
himself
he
resolved
to
send
her
to
england
with
despatches
and
retain
the
other
frigate
which
had
been
ordered
home
and
which
we
had
been
sent
up
to
replace
we
therefore
heard
it
announced
with
feelings
of
joy
mingled
with
regret
that
we
were
immediately
to
proceed
to
england
for
my
part
i
was
glad
of
it
i
had
now
served
my
time
as
midshipman
to
within
five
months
and
i
thought
that
i
had
a
better
chance
of
being
made
in
england
than
abroad
i
was
also
very
anxious
to
go
home
for
family
reasons
which
i
have
already
explained
in
a
fortnight
we
sailed
with
several
vessels
and
directions
to
take
charge
of
a
large
convoy
from
quebec
which
was
to
meet
us
off
the
island
of
st
john
in
a
few
days
we
joined
our
convoy
and
with
a
fair
wind
bore
up
for
england
the
weather
soon
became
very
bad
and
we
were
scudding
before
a
heavy
gale
under
bare
poles
our
captain
seldom
quitted
the
cabin
but
remained
there
on
a
sofa
stretched
at
his
length
reading
a
novel
or
dozing
as
he
found
most
agreeable
i
recollect
a
circumstance
which
occurred
which
will
prove
the
apathy
of
his
disposition
and
how
unfit
he
was
to
command
so
fine
a
frigate
we
had
been
scudding
three
days
when
the
weather
became
much
worse
who
had
the
middle
watch
went
down
to
report
that
it
blew
very
hard
very
well
said
the
captain
let
me
know
if
it
blows
harder
in
about
an
hour
more
the
gale
increased
and
went
down
again
it
blows
much
harder
captain
horton
very
well
answered
captain
horton
turning
in
his
cot
you
may
call
me
again
when
it
at
about
six
bells
the
gale
was
at
its
height
and
the
wind
roared
in
its
fury
down
went
again
it
blows
tremendous
hard
now
captain
horton
well
well
if
the
weather
becomes
worse
it
ca
be
worse
interrupted
it
impossible
to
blow
harder
indeed
well
then
replied
the
captain
let
me
know
when
in
the
morning
watch
a
similar
circumstance
took
place
mr
phillott
went
down
and
said
that
several
of
the
convoy
were
out
of
sight
astern
shall
we
captain
horton
oh
no
replied
he
she
will
be
so
uneasy
let
me
know
if
you
lose
sight
of
any
more
in
another
hour
the
first
lieutenant
reported
that
there
were
very
few
to
be
seen
very
well
mr
phillott
replied
the
captain
turning
round
to
sleep
let
me
know
if
you
lose
any
more
some
time
elapsed
and
the
first
lieutenant
reported
that
they
were
all
out
of
sight
very
well
then
said
the
captain
call
me
when
you
see
them
again
this
was
not
very
likely
to
take
place
as
we
were
going
twelve
knots
an
hour
and
running
away
from
them
as
fast
as
we
could
so
the
captain
remained
undisturbed
until
he
thought
proper
to
get
up
to
breakfast
indeed
we
never
saw
any
more
of
our
convoy
but
taking
the
gale
with
us
in
fifteen
days
anchored
in
plymouth
sound
the
orders
came
down
for
the
frigate
to
be
paid
off
all
standing
and
recommissioned
i
received
letters
from
my
father
in
which
he
congratulated
me
at
my
name
being
mentioned
in
captain
kearney
despatches
and
requested
me
to
come
home
as
soon
as
i
could
the
admiral
allowed
my
name
to
be
put
down
on
the
books
of
the
that
i
might
not
lose
my
time
and
then
gave
me
two
months
leave
of
absence
i
bade
farewell
to
my
shipmates
shook
hands
with
who
proposed
to
go
over
to
ireland
previous
to
his
applying
for
another
ship
and
with
my
pay
in
my
pocket
set
off
in
the
plymouth
mail
and
in
three
days
was
once
more
in
the
arms
of
my
affectionate
mother
and
warmly
greeted
by
my
father
and
the
remainder
of
my
family
once
more
with
my
family
i
must
acquaint
the
reader
with
what
had
occurred
since
my
departure
my
eldest
sister
lucy
had
married
an
officer
in
the
army
a
captain
fielding
and
his
regiment
having
been
ordered
out
to
india
had
accompanied
her
husband
and
letters
had
been
received
just
before
my
return
announcing
their
safe
arrival
at
ceylon
my
second
sister
mary
had
also
been
engaged
to
be
married
and
from
her
infancy
was
of
extremely
delicate
health
she
was
very
handsome
and
much
admired
her
intended
husband
was
a
baronet
of
good
family
but
unfortunately
she
caught
a
cold
at
the
assize
ball
and
went
off
in
a
decline
she
died
about
two
months
before
my
arrival
and
the
family
were
in
deep
mourning
my
third
sister
ellen
was
still
unmarried
she
also
was
a
very
beautiful
girl
and
now
seventeen
my
constitution
was
much
shaken
by
the
loss
of
my
sister
mary
and
the
separation
from
her
eldest
child
as
for
my
father
even
the
loss
of
his
daughter
appeared
to
be
wholly
forgotten
in
the
unwelcome
intelligence
which
he
had
received
that
my
uncle
wife
had
been
safely
delivered
of
a
which
threw
him
out
of
the
anticipated
titles
and
estates
of
my
grandfather
it
was
indeed
a
house
of
mourning
my
mother
grief
i
respected
and
tried
all
i
could
to
console
her
that
of
my
father
was
so
evidently
worldly
and
so
at
variance
with
his
clerical
profession
that
i
must
acknowledge
i
felt
more
of
anger
at
it
than
sorrow
he
had
become
morose
and
sullen
harsh
to
those
around
him
and
not
so
kind
to
my
mother
as
her
state
of
mind
and
health
made
it
his
duty
to
be
even
if
inclination
were
wanted
he
seldom
passed
any
portion
of
the
day
with
her
and
in
the
evening
she
went
to
bed
very
early
so
that
there
was
little
communication
between
them
my
sister
was
a
great
consolation
to
her
and
so
i
hope
was
i
she
often
said
so
as
she
embraced
me
and
the
tears
rolled
down
her
cheeks
and
i
could
not
help
surmising
that
those
tears
were
doubled
from
the
coolness
and
indifference
if
not
unkindness
with
which
my
father
behaved
to
her
as
for
my
sister
she
was
an
angel
and
as
i
witnessed
her
considerate
attentions
to
my
mother
and
the
total
forgetfulness
of
self
which
she
displayed
so
different
from
my
father
who
was
all
self
i
often
thought
what
a
treasure
she
would
prove
to
any
man
who
was
fortunate
enough
to
win
her
love
such
was
the
state
of
my
family
when
i
returned
to
it
i
had
been
at
home
about
a
week
when
one
evening
after
dinner
i
submitted
to
my
father
the
propriety
of
trying
to
obtain
my
promotion
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
peter
i
have
no
interest
whatever
replied
he
moodily
i
do
not
think
that
much
is
required
sir
replied
i
my
time
will
be
served
on
the
of
next
month
if
i
pass
which
i
trust
i
shall
be
able
to
do
my
name
having
been
mentioned
in
the
public
despatches
will
render
it
a
point
of
no
very
great
difficulty
to
obtain
my
commission
at
the
request
of
my
grandfather
yes
your
grandfather
might
succeed
i
have
no
doubt
but
i
think
you
have
little
chance
now
in
that
quarter
my
brother
has
a
son
and
we
are
thrown
out
you
are
not
aware
peter
how
selfish
people
are
and
how
little
they
will
exert
themselves
for
their
relations
your
grandfather
has
never
invited
me
since
the
announcement
of
my
brother
increase
to
his
family
indeed
i
have
never
been
near
him
for
i
know
that
it
is
of
no
use
i
must
think
otherwise
of
lord
privilege
my
dear
father
until
your
opinion
is
confirmed
by
his
own
conduct
that
i
am
not
so
much
an
object
of
interest
i
grant
but
still
he
was
very
kind
and
appeared
to
be
partial
to
me
well
well
you
can
try
all
you
can
but
you
soon
see
of
what
stuff
this
world
is
made
i
am
sure
i
hope
it
will
be
so
for
what
is
to
become
of
you
children
if
i
die
i
do
not
know
i
have
saved
little
or
nothing
and
now
all
my
prospects
are
blasted
by
this
and
my
father
dashed
his
fist
upon
the
table
in
a
manner
by
no
means
clerical
and
with
a
look
very
unworthy
of
an
apostle
i
am
sorry
that
i
must
thus
speak
of
my
father
but
i
must
not
disguise
the
truth
still
i
must
say
there
was
much
in
extenuation
of
his
conduct
he
had
always
a
dislike
to
the
profession
of
the
church
his
ambition
as
a
young
man
had
been
to
enter
the
army
for
which
service
he
was
much
better
qualified
but
as
it
has
been
the
custom
for
centuries
to
entail
all
the
property
of
the
aristocracy
upon
the
eldest
son
and
leave
the
other
brothers
to
be
supported
by
the
state
or
rather
by
the
people
who
are
taxed
for
their
provision
my
father
was
not
permitted
to
follow
the
bent
of
his
own
inclination
an
elder
brother
had
already
selected
the
army
as
his
profession
and
it
was
therefore
decided
that
my
father
should
enter
the
church
and
thus
it
is
that
we
have
had
and
still
have
so
many
people
in
that
profession
who
are
not
only
totally
unfit
for
but
who
actually
disgrace
their
calling
the
law
of
primogeniture
is
beset
with
evils
and
injustice
yet
without
it
the
aristocracy
of
a
country
must
sink
into
insignificance
it
appears
to
me
that
as
long
as
the
people
of
a
country
are
content
to
support
the
younger
sons
of
the
nobility
it
is
well
that
the
aristocracy
should
be
held
up
as
a
third
estate
and
a
link
between
the
sovereign
and
the
people
but
that
if
the
people
are
either
too
poor
or
are
unwilling
to
be
so
taxed
they
have
a
right
to
refuse
taxation
for
such
purposes
and
to
demand
that
the
law
of
primogeniture
should
be
abolished
i
remained
at
home
until
my
time
was
complete
and
then
set
off
for
plymouth
to
undergo
my
examination
the
had
been
fixed
by
the
admiral
for
the
friday
and
as
i
arrived
on
wednesday
i
amused
myself
during
the
day
walking
about
the
dockyard
and
trying
all
i
could
to
obtain
further
information
in
my
profession
on
the
thursday
a
party
of
soldiers
from
the
depot
were
embarking
at
the
in
boats
and
as
i
understood
were
about
to
proceed
to
india
i
witnessed
the
embarkation
and
waited
till
they
shoved
off
and
then
walked
to
the
anchor
wharf
to
ascertain
the
weights
of
the
respective
anchors
of
the
different
classes
of
vessels
in
the
king
service
i
had
not
been
there
long
when
i
was
attracted
by
the
squabbling
created
by
a
soldier
who
it
appeared
had
quitted
the
ranks
to
run
up
to
the
tap
in
the
dockyard
to
obtain
liquor
he
was
very
drunk
and
was
followed
by
a
young
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
who
was
endeavouring
to
pacify
him
now
be
quiet
patrick
jewel
said
she
clinging
to
him
sure
enough
that
you
left
the
ranks
and
will
come
to
disgrace
when
you
get
on
board
now
be
quiet
patrick
and
let
us
ask
for
a
boat
and
then
perhaps
the
officer
will
think
it
was
all
a
mistake
and
let
you
off
aisy
and
sure
i
speak
to
mr
and
he
a
kind
man
out
wid
you
you
cratur
it
is
mr
you
be
having
a
conversation
wid
and
he
be
chucking
you
under
that
chin
of
yours
out
wid
you
mary
and
lave
me
to
find
my
way
on
board
is
it
a
boat
i
want
when
i
can
swim
like
st
patrick
wid
my
head
under
my
arm
if
it
on
my
shoulders
at
all
events
i
can
wid
my
nappersack
and
musket
to
boot
the
young
woman
cried
and
tried
to
restrain
him
but
he
broke
from
her
and
running
down
to
the
wharf
dashed
off
into
the
water
the
young
woman
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
wharf
perceived
him
sinking
and
shrieking
with
despair
threw
up
her
arms
in
her
agony
the
child
fell
struck
on
the
edge
of
the
piles
turned
over
and
before
i
could
catch
hold
of
it
sank
into
the
sea
the
child
the
child
burst
forth
in
another
wild
scream
and
the
poor
creature
lay
at
my
feet
in
violent
fits
i
looked
over
the
child
had
disappeared
but
the
soldier
was
still
struggling
with
his
head
above
water
he
sank
and
rose
again
a
boat
was
pulling
towards
him
but
he
was
quite
exhausted
he
threw
back
his
arms
as
if
in
despair
and
was
about
disappearing
under
a
wave
when
no
longer
able
to
restrain
myself
i
leaped
off
the
high
wharf
and
swam
to
his
assistance
just
in
time
to
lay
hold
of
him
as
he
was
sinking
for
the
last
time
i
had
not
been
in
the
water
a
quarter
of
a
minute
before
the
boat
came
up
to
us
and
dragged
us
on
board
the
soldier
was
exhausted
and
speechless
i
of
course
was
only
very
wet
the
boat
rowed
to
the
at
my
request
and
we
were
both
put
on
shore
the
knapsack
which
was
fixed
on
the
soldier
back
and
his
regimentals
indicated
that
he
belonged
to
the
regiment
just
embarked
and
i
stated
my
opinion
that
as
soon
as
he
was
a
little
recovered
he
had
better
be
taken
on
board
as
the
boat
which
picked
us
up
was
one
of
the
boats
the
officer
who
had
been
embarking
the
troops
and
had
been
sent
on
shore
again
to
know
if
there
were
any
yet
left
behind
consented
in
a
few
minutes
the
soldier
recovered
and
was
able
to
sit
up
and
speak
and
i
only
waited
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
poor
young
woman
whom
i
had
left
on
the
wharf
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
led
to
us
by
the
warder
and
the
scene
between
her
and
her
husband
was
most
affecting
when
she
had
become
a
little
composed
she
turned
round
to
me
where
i
stood
dripping
wet
and
intermingled
with
lamentation
for
the
child
showering
down
emphatic
blessings
on
my
head
inquired
my
name
give
it
to
me
she
cried
give
it
to
me
on
paper
in
writing
that
i
may
wear
it
next
my
heart
read
and
kiss
it
every
day
of
my
life
and
never
forget
to
pray
for
you
and
to
bless
you
i
tell
it
you
my
name
nay
write
it
down
for
me
write
it
down
sure
you
not
refuse
me
all
the
saints
bless
you
dear
young
man
for
saving
a
poor
woman
from
despair
the
officer
commanding
the
boat
handed
me
a
pencil
and
a
card
i
wrote
my
name
and
gave
it
to
the
poor
woman
she
took
my
hand
as
i
gave
it
kissed
the
card
repeatedly
and
put
it
into
her
bosom
the
officer
impatient
to
shove
off
ordered
her
husband
into
the
boat
she
followed
clinging
to
him
wet
as
he
was
the
boat
shoved
off
and
i
hastened
up
to
the
inn
to
dry
my
clothes
i
could
not
help
observing
at
the
time
how
the
fear
of
a
greater
evil
will
absorb
all
consideration
for
a
minor
satisfied
that
her
husband
had
not
perished
she
had
hardly
once
appeared
to
remember
that
she
had
lost
her
child
i
had
only
brought
one
suit
of
clothes
with
me
they
were
in
very
good
condition
when
i
arrived
but
salt
water
plays
the
devil
with
a
uniform
i
laid
in
bed
until
they
were
dry
but
when
i
put
them
on
again
not
being
before
too
large
for
me
for
i
grew
very
fast
they
were
now
shrunk
and
shrivelled
up
so
as
to
be
much
too
small
my
wrists
appeared
below
the
sleeves
of
my
coat
my
trousers
had
shrunk
half
way
up
to
my
knees
the
buttons
were
all
tarnished
and
altogether
i
certainly
did
not
wear
the
appearance
of
a
gentlemanly
smart
midshipman
i
would
have
ordered
another
suit
but
the
examination
was
to
take
place
at
ten
the
next
morning
and
there
was
no
time
i
was
therefore
obliged
to
appear
as
i
was
on
the
of
the
ship
on
board
of
which
the
passing
was
to
take
place
many
others
were
there
to
undergo
the
same
ordeal
all
strangers
to
me
and
as
i
perceived
by
their
nods
and
winks
to
each
other
as
they
walked
up
and
down
in
their
smart
clothes
not
at
all
inclined
to
make
my
acquaintance
there
were
many
before
me
on
the
list
and
our
hearts
beat
every
time
that
a
name
was
called
and
the
owner
of
it
walked
aft
into
the
cabin
some
returned
with
jocund
faces
and
our
hopes
mounted
with
the
anticipation
of
similar
good
fortune
others
came
out
melancholy
and
and
then
the
expression
of
their
countenances
was
communicated
to
our
own
and
we
quailed
with
fear
and
apprehension
i
have
no
hesitation
in
asserting
that
although
passing
may
be
a
proof
of
being
qualified
not
passing
is
certainly
no
proof
to
the
contrary
i
have
known
many
of
the
cleverest
young
men
turned
back
while
others
of
inferior
abilities
have
succeeded
merely
from
the
feeling
of
awe
occasioned
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
situation
and
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
when
it
is
considered
that
all
the
labour
and
exertion
of
six
years
are
at
stake
at
this
appalling
moment
at
last
my
name
was
called
and
almost
breathless
from
anxiety
i
entered
the
cabin
where
i
found
myself
in
presence
of
the
three
captains
who
were
to
decide
whether
i
were
fit
to
hold
a
commission
in
his
majesty
service
my
logs
and
certificates
were
examined
and
approved
my
time
calculated
and
allowed
to
be
correct
the
questions
in
navigation
which
were
put
to
me
were
very
few
for
the
best
of
all
possible
reasons
that
most
captains
in
his
majesty
service
know
little
or
nothing
of
navigation
during
their
servitude
as
midshipmen
they
learn
it
by
without
being
aware
of
the
principles
upon
which
the
calculations
they
use
are
founded
as
lieutenants
their
services
as
to
navigation
are
seldom
required
and
they
rapidly
forget
all
about
it
as
captains
their
whole
remnant
of
mathematical
knowledge
consists
in
being
able
to
set
down
the
ship
position
on
the
chart
as
for
navigating
the
ship
the
master
is
answerable
and
the
captains
not
being
responsible
themselves
they
trust
entirely
to
his
reckoning
of
course
there
are
exceptions
but
what
i
state
is
the
fact
and
if
an
order
from
the
admiralty
was
given
that
all
captains
should
pass
again
although
they
might
acquit
themselves
very
well
in
seamanship
nineteen
out
of
twenty
would
be
turned
back
when
they
were
questioned
in
navigation
it
is
from
the
knowledge
of
this
fact
that
i
think
the
service
is
injured
by
the
present
system
and
the
captain
should
be
held
for
the
navigation
of
his
ship
it
has
been
long
known
that
the
officers
of
every
other
maritime
state
are
more
scientific
than
our
own
which
is
easily
explained
from
the
responsibility
not
being
invested
in
our
captains
the
origin
of
masters
in
our
service
is
singular
when
england
first
became
a
maritime
power
ships
for
the
king
service
were
found
by
the
cinque
ports
and
other
parties
the
fighting
part
of
the
crew
was
composed
of
soldiers
sent
on
board
all
the
vessels
at
that
time
had
a
crew
of
sailors
with
a
master
to
navigate
the
vessel
during
our
bloody
naval
engagements
with
the
dutch
the
same
system
was
acted
upon
i
think
it
was
the
earl
of
sandwich
of
whom
it
is
stated
that
his
ship
being
in
a
sinking
state
he
took
a
boat
to
hoist
his
flag
on
board
of
another
vessel
in
the
fleet
but
a
shot
cutting
the
boat
in
two
and
the
of
his
bearing
him
down
the
earl
of
sandwich
perished
but
to
proceed
as
soon
as
i
had
answered
several
questions
satisfactorily
i
was
desired
to
stand
up
the
captain
who
had
interrogated
me
on
navigation
was
very
grave
in
his
demeanour
towards
me
but
at
the
same
time
not
uncivil
during
his
examination
he
was
not
interfered
with
by
the
other
two
who
only
undertook
the
examination
in
seamanship
the
captain
who
now
desired
me
to
stand
up
spoke
in
a
very
harsh
tone
and
quite
frightened
me
i
stood
up
pale
and
trembling
for
i
augured
no
good
from
this
commencement
several
questions
in
seamanship
were
put
to
me
which
i
have
no
doubt
i
answered
in
a
very
lame
way
for
i
can
not
even
now
recollect
what
i
said
i
thought
so
observed
the
captain
i
judged
as
much
from
your
appearance
an
officer
who
is
so
careless
of
his
dress
as
not
even
to
put
on
a
decent
coat
when
he
appears
at
his
examination
generally
turns
out
an
idle
fellow
and
no
seaman
one
would
think
you
had
served
all
your
time
in
a
cutter
or
a
brig
instead
of
dashing
frigates
come
sir
i
give
you
one
more
chance
i
was
so
hurt
at
what
the
captain
said
that
i
could
not
control
my
feelings
i
replied
with
a
quivering
lip
that
i
had
had
no
time
to
order
another
uniform
and
i
burst
into
tears
indeed
burrows
you
are
rather
too
harsh
said
the
third
captain
the
lad
is
frightened
let
him
sit
down
and
compose
himself
for
a
little
while
sit
down
mr
simple
and
we
will
try
you
again
directly
i
sat
down
checking
my
grief
and
trying
to
recall
my
scattered
senses
the
captains
in
the
meantime
turning
over
the
logs
to
pass
away
the
time
the
one
who
had
questioned
me
in
navigation
reading
the
plymouth
newspaper
which
had
a
few
minutes
before
been
brought
on
board
and
sent
into
the
cabin
heh
what
this
i
say
burrows
keats
look
here
and
he
pointed
to
a
paragraph
mr
simple
may
i
ask
whether
it
was
you
who
saved
the
soldier
who
leaped
off
the
wharf
yesterday
yes
sir
replied
i
and
that
the
reason
why
my
uniforms
are
so
shabby
i
spoilt
them
then
and
had
no
time
to
order
others
i
did
not
like
to
say
why
they
were
spoilt
i
saw
a
change
in
the
countenances
of
all
the
three
and
it
gave
me
courage
indeed
now
that
my
feelings
had
found
vent
i
was
no
longer
under
any
apprehension
come
mr
simple
stand
up
again
said
the
captain
kindly
that
is
if
you
feel
sufficiently
composed
if
not
we
will
wait
a
little
longer
do
be
afraid
we
to
pass
you
i
was
not
afraid
and
stood
up
immediately
i
answered
every
question
satisfactorily
and
finding
that
i
did
so
they
put
more
difficult
ones
very
good
very
good
indeed
mr
simple
now
let
me
ask
you
one
more
it
seldom
done
in
the
service
and
perhaps
you
may
not
be
able
to
answer
it
do
you
know
how
to
a
ship
yes
sir
replied
i
having
as
the
reader
may
recollect
witnessed
the
manoeuvre
when
serving
under
poor
captain
savage
and
i
immediately
stated
how
it
was
to
be
done
that
is
sufficient
mr
simple
i
wish
to
ask
you
no
more
questions
i
thought
at
first
you
were
a
careless
officer
and
no
seaman
i
now
find
that
you
are
a
good
seaman
and
a
gallant
young
man
do
you
wish
to
ask
any
more
questions
continued
he
turning
to
the
two
others
they
replied
in
the
negative
my
passing
certificate
was
signed
and
the
captains
did
me
the
honour
to
shake
hands
with
me
and
wish
me
speedy
promotion
thus
ended
happily
this
severe
trial
to
my
poor
nerves
and
as
i
came
out
of
the
cabin
no
one
could
have
imagined
that
i
had
been
in
such
distress
within
when
they
beheld
the
joy
that
irradiated
my
countenance
chapter
xxxix
is
a
chapter
of
plots
catholic
casuistry
in
a
new
cassock
plotting
promotes
promotion
a
peasant
love
and
a
peer
peevishness
prospects
of
prosperity
as
soon
as
i
arrived
at
the
hotel
i
sent
for
a
plymouth
paper
and
cut
out
the
paragraph
which
had
been
of
such
importance
to
me
in
my
emergency
and
the
next
morning
returned
home
to
receive
the
congratulations
of
my
family
i
found
a
letter
from
which
had
arrived
the
day
before
it
was
as
follows
my
dear
peter
some
people
they
say
are
lucky
to
a
father
born
before
them
because
they
are
helped
on
in
the
world
upon
which
principle
mine
was
born
me
that
certain
however
that
ca
be
helped
i
found
all
my
family
well
and
hearty
but
they
all
shook
a
cloth
in
the
wind
with
respect
to
toggery
as
for
father
cassock
he
did
complain
of
it
without
reason
it
was
the
ghost
of
a
garment
but
however
with
the
blessing
of
god
my
last
quarterly
bill
and
the
help
of
a
tailor
we
have
had
a
regular
refit
and
the
ancient
family
of
the
of
ballyhinch
are
now
rigged
from
stem
to
starn
my
two
sisters
are
both
to
be
spliced
to
young
squireens
in
the
neighbourhood
it
appears
that
they
only
wanted
for
a
dacent
town
gown
to
go
to
the
church
in
they
will
be
turned
off
next
friday
and
i
only
wish
peter
you
were
here
to
dance
at
the
weddings
never
mind
i
dance
for
you
and
for
myself
too
in
the
meantime
i
just
tell
you
what
father
and
i
have
been
doing
all
about
and
consarning
that
thief
of
an
uncle
of
yours
it
very
little
or
nothing
at
all
that
father
did
before
i
came
back
seeing
as
how
father
had
a
new
cassock
and
father
was
so
shabby
that
he
could
face
him
under
such
a
disadvantage
but
still
father
spied
about
him
and
had
several
hints
from
here
and
from
there
all
of
which
when
i
came
to
add
them
up
amounted
to
just
nothing
at
all
but
since
i
came
home
we
have
been
busy
father
went
down
to
ballycleuch
as
bold
as
a
lion
in
his
new
clothing
swearing
that
lead
father
by
the
nose
for
slamming
the
door
in
his
face
and
so
he
would
have
done
if
he
could
have
found
him
but
as
he
was
to
be
found
father
came
back
again
just
as
wise
and
quite
as
brave
as
he
went
out
so
peter
i
just
took
a
walk
that
way
myself
and
as
i
surrounded
the
old
house
where
your
uncle
had
taken
up
his
quarters
who
should
i
meet
but
the
little
girl
ella
flanagan
who
was
in
his
service
and
i
said
to
myself
two
ways
of
obtaining
things
in
this
world
one
is
for
love
and
the
other
is
for
money
the
are
better
off
in
the
first
article
than
in
the
last
as
most
of
their
countrymen
are
so
i
been
spending
it
very
freely
in
your
service
peter
says
i
are
the
little
girl
that
my
eyes
were
ever
looking
upon
when
last
i
was
in
this
way
who
are
you
says
she
of
his
majesty
service
just
come
home
for
a
minute
to
look
out
for
a
wife
says
i
it
one
about
your
make
and
shape
and
discretion
that
would
please
my
fancy
and
then
i
praised
her
eyes
and
her
nose
and
her
forehead
and
so
downwards
until
i
came
to
the
soles
of
her
feet
and
asked
her
leave
to
see
her
again
and
when
she
would
meet
me
in
the
wood
and
tell
me
her
mind
at
first
she
thought
sure
enough
that
i
could
be
in
earnest
but
i
swore
by
all
the
saints
that
she
was
the
prettiest
girl
in
the
parts
and
so
she
is
altogether
and
then
she
listened
to
my
blarney
the
devil
a
word
did
i
say
about
your
uncle
or
your
aunt
or
father
that
she
might
not
suspect
for
i
an
idea
that
they
all
in
the
story
i
only
talked
about
my
love
for
her
pretty
self
and
that
blinded
her
as
it
will
all
women
as
they
may
be
and
now
peter
it
three
weeks
last
sunday
that
i
been
bespeaking
this
poor
girl
for
your
sake
and
my
conscience
tells
me
that
it
not
right
to
make
the
poor
crature
fond
of
me
seeing
as
how
that
i
do
care
a
fig
for
her
in
the
way
of
a
wife
and
in
any
other
way
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
the
poor
thing
i
have
spoken
to
father
on
the
subject
who
says
we
may
do
evil
that
good
may
come
and
that
if
she
has
been
a
party
to
the
deceit
it
nothing
but
proper
that
she
should
be
punished
in
this
world
and
that
will
perhaps
save
her
in
the
next
still
i
do
like
it
peter
and
only
for
you
among
the
living
that
i
do
such
a
thing
for
the
poor
creature
now
hangs
upon
me
so
fondly
and
talks
about
the
and
tells
me
long
stories
about
the
connections
which
have
taken
place
between
the
and
the
times
bygone
when
they
were
all
in
their
glory
yesterday
as
we
sat
in
the
wood
with
her
arm
round
my
waist
dear
says
i
are
these
people
that
you
stay
with
and
then
she
told
me
all
she
knew
about
their
history
and
how
mary
sullivan
was
a
nurse
to
the
baby
what
is
the
baby
says
i
boy
sure
says
she
sullivan
baby
a
girl
is
mary
sullivan
there
now
says
she
yestreen
she
left
with
her
husband
and
baby
to
join
the
regiment
that
going
out
to
ingy
she
left
says
i
starting
up
replies
she
what
do
you
care
about
them
very
much
i
care
replied
i
a
little
bird
has
whispered
a
secret
to
me
what
may
that
be
says
she
that
the
childer
were
changed
and
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do
but
she
swore
that
she
knew
nothing
about
it
and
that
she
was
not
there
when
either
of
the
children
was
born
and
i
believe
that
she
told
the
truth
says
i
tended
the
lady
own
mother
says
ella
if
it
was
so
who
can
know
but
she
then
says
i
jewel
i
made
a
vow
that
i
never
marry
till
i
find
out
the
truth
of
this
matter
so
the
sooner
you
get
it
out
of
your
mother
the
better
then
she
cried
very
much
and
i
was
almost
ready
to
cry
too
to
see
how
the
poor
thing
was
vexed
at
the
idea
of
not
being
married
after
a
while
she
swabbed
up
her
cheeks
and
kissing
me
wished
me
swearing
by
all
the
saints
that
the
truth
should
come
out
somehow
or
another
it
this
morning
that
i
saw
her
again
as
agreed
upon
yesterday
and
red
her
eyes
were
with
weeping
poor
thing
and
she
clung
to
me
and
begged
me
to
forgive
her
and
not
to
leave
her
and
then
she
told
me
that
her
mother
was
startled
when
she
put
the
question
to
her
and
chewed
it
and
cursed
her
when
she
insisted
upon
the
truth
and
how
she
had
fallen
on
her
knees
and
begged
her
mother
not
to
stand
in
the
way
of
her
happiness
as
she
would
die
if
she
did
i
leave
you
to
guess
if
my
heart
did
smite
me
when
she
said
that
peter
but
the
mischief
was
done
and
how
her
mother
had
talked
about
her
oath
and
father
and
said
that
she
would
speak
to
him
now
peter
i
sure
that
the
childer
have
been
changed
and
that
the
nurse
has
been
sent
to
the
indies
to
be
out
of
the
way
they
say
they
were
to
go
to
plymouth
the
husband
name
is
of
course
so
i
recommend
you
to
take
a
coach
and
see
what
you
can
do
in
that
quarter
in
the
meantime
i
try
all
i
can
for
the
truth
in
this
and
will
write
again
as
soon
as
i
can
find
out
anything
more
all
i
want
to
do
is
to
get
father
to
go
to
the
old
devil
of
a
mother
and
i
answer
for
it
he
frighten
her
into
swearing
anything
god
bless
you
peter
and
give
my
love
to
all
the
family
yours
ever
terence
this
letter
of
was
the
subject
of
much
meditation
the
advice
to
go
to
plymouth
was
too
late
the
troops
having
sailed
some
time
and
i
had
no
doubt
but
that
mary
sullivan
and
her
husband
were
among
those
who
had
embarked
at
the
time
that
i
was
at
that
port
to
pass
my
examination
show
the
letter
to
my
father
i
would
not
as
it
would
only
have
put
him
in
a
fever
and
his
interference
would
in
all
probability
have
done
more
harm
than
good
i
therefore
waited
quietly
for
more
intelligence
and
resolved
to
apply
to
my
grandfather
to
obtain
my
promotion
a
few
days
afterwards
i
set
off
for
eagle
park
and
arrived
about
eleven
in
the
morning
i
sent
in
my
name
and
was
admitted
into
the
library
where
i
found
lord
privilege
in
his
easy
chair
as
usual
well
child
said
he
remaining
on
his
chair
and
not
offering
even
finger
to
me
what
do
you
want
that
you
come
here
without
an
invitation
only
my
lord
to
inquire
after
your
health
and
to
thank
you
for
your
kindness
to
me
in
procuring
me
and
mr
the
appointment
to
a
fine
frigate
yes
replied
his
lordship
i
recollect
i
think
i
did
so
at
your
request
and
i
think
i
heard
some
one
say
that
you
have
behaved
well
and
had
been
mentioned
in
the
despatches
yes
my
lord
replied
i
and
i
have
since
passed
my
examination
for
lieutenant
well
child
i
glad
to
hear
it
remember
me
to
your
father
and
family
and
his
lordship
cast
his
eyes
down
upon
the
book
which
he
had
been
reading
my
father
observations
appeared
to
be
well
grounded
but
i
would
not
leave
the
room
until
i
had
made
some
further
attempt
has
your
lordship
heard
from
my
uncle
yes
replied
he
i
had
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
the
child
is
quite
well
i
expect
them
all
here
in
a
fortnight
or
three
weeks
to
live
with
me
altogether
i
am
old
getting
very
old
and
i
shall
have
much
to
arrange
with
your
uncle
before
i
die
if
i
might
request
a
favour
of
your
lordship
it
would
be
to
beg
that
you
would
interest
yourself
a
little
in
obtaining
my
promotion
a
letter
from
your
lordship
to
the
first
lord
only
a
few
lines
well
child
i
see
no
objection
only
i
am
very
old
too
old
to
write
now
and
his
lordship
again
commenced
reading
i
must
do
lord
privilege
the
justice
to
state
that
he
evidently
was
fast
verging
to
a
state
of
second
childhood
he
was
much
bowed
down
since
i
had
last
seen
him
and
appeared
infirm
in
body
as
well
as
mind
i
waited
at
least
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
his
lordship
looked
up
what
not
gone
yet
child
i
thought
you
had
gone
home
your
lordship
was
kind
enough
to
say
that
you
had
no
objection
to
write
a
few
lines
to
the
first
lord
in
my
behalf
i
trust
your
lordship
will
not
refuse
me
well
replied
he
peevishly
so
i
did
but
i
am
too
old
too
old
to
write
i
can
not
see
i
can
hardly
hold
a
pen
will
your
lordship
allow
me
the
honour
of
writing
the
letter
for
your
lordship
signature
well
child
yes
i
no
objection
write
as
follows
no
write
anything
you
please
and
i
sign
it
i
wish
your
uncle
william
were
come
this
was
more
than
i
did
i
had
a
great
mind
to
show
him
letter
but
i
thought
it
would
be
cruel
to
raise
doubts
and
harass
the
mind
of
a
person
so
close
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
the
truth
would
never
be
ascertained
during
his
life
i
thought
and
why
therefore
should
i
give
him
pain
at
all
events
although
i
had
the
letter
in
my
pocket
i
resolved
not
to
make
use
of
it
except
as
a
resort
i
went
to
another
table
and
sat
down
to
write
the
letter
as
his
lordship
had
said
that
i
might
write
what
i
pleased
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
assist
and
i
felt
sure
that
his
lordship
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
read
the
letter
i
therefore
wrote
as
follows
while
lord
privilege
continued
to
read
his
book
my
lord
you
will
confer
a
very
great
favour
upon
me
if
you
will
hasten
the
commission
which
i
have
no
doubt
is
in
preparation
for
my
nephew
mr
simple
who
has
passed
his
examination
and
has
been
mentioned
in
the
public
despatches
and
also
that
you
will
not
lose
sight
of
lieutenant
who
has
so
distinguished
himself
by
his
gallantry
in
the
various
expeditions
in
the
west
indies
trusting
that
your
lordship
will
not
fail
to
comply
with
my
earnest
request
i
have
the
honour
to
be
your
lordship
very
obedient
humble
servant
i
brought
this
letter
with
a
pen
full
of
ink
and
the
noise
of
my
approach
induced
his
lordship
to
look
up
he
stared
at
first
as
having
forgotten
the
whole
circumstance
then
said
oh
yes
i
recollect
so
i
did
give
me
the
pen
with
a
trembling
hand
he
signed
his
name
and
gave
me
back
the
letter
without
reading
it
as
i
expected
there
child
do
tease
me
any
more
remember
me
to
your
father
i
wished
his
lordship
a
good
morning
and
went
away
well
satisfied
with
the
result
of
my
expedition
on
my
arrival
i
showed
the
letter
to
my
father
who
was
much
surprised
at
my
success
and
he
assured
me
that
my
grandfather
interest
was
so
great
with
the
administration
that
i
might
consider
my
promotion
as
certain
that
no
accident
might
happen
i
immediately
set
off
for
london
and
delivered
the
letter
at
the
door
of
the
first
lord
with
my
own
hands
leaving
my
address
with
the
porter
chapter
xl
and
myself
take
a
step
each
a
family
reunion
productive
of
anything
but
unity
my
uncle
not
always
the
best
friend
a
few
days
afterwards
i
left
my
card
with
my
address
with
the
first
lord
and
the
next
day
received
a
letter
from
his
secretary
which
to
my
delight
informed
me
that
my
commission
had
been
made
out
some
days
before
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
hastened
to
take
it
up
and
when
paying
my
fee
to
the
clerk
i
ventured
at
a
hazard
to
inquire
whether
he
knew
the
address
of
lieutenant
no
replied
he
i
wish
to
find
it
out
for
he
has
this
day
been
promoted
to
the
rank
of
commander
i
almost
leaped
with
joy
when
i
heard
this
good
news
i
gave
address
to
the
clerk
hastened
away
with
my
invaluable
piece
of
parchment
in
my
hand
and
set
off
immediately
for
my
father
house
but
i
was
met
with
sorrow
my
mother
had
been
taken
severely
ill
and
i
found
the
house
in
commotion
doctors
and
apothecaries
and
nurses
running
to
and
fro
my
father
in
a
state
of
excitement
and
my
dear
sister
in
tears
spasm
succeeded
spasm
and
although
every
remedy
was
applied
the
next
evening
she
breathed
her
last
i
will
not
attempt
to
describe
the
grief
of
my
father
who
appeared
to
feel
remorse
at
his
late
unkind
treatment
of
her
my
sister
and
myself
these
scenes
must
be
imagined
by
those
who
have
suffered
under
similar
bereavements
i
exerted
myself
to
console
my
poor
sister
who
appeared
to
cling
to
me
as
to
her
only
support
and
after
the
funeral
was
over
we
recovered
our
tranquillity
although
the
mourning
was
still
deeper
in
our
hearts
than
in
our
outward
dress
i
had
written
to
to
announce
the
mournful
intelligence
and
like
a
true
friend
he
immediately
made
his
appearance
to
console
me
had
received
the
letter
from
the
admiralty
acquainting
him
with
his
promotion
and
two
days
after
he
arrived
went
to
take
up
his
commission
i
told
him
frankly
by
what
means
he
had
obtained
it
and
he
again
concluded
his
thanks
by
a
reference
to
the
mistake
of
the
former
supposition
that
of
my
being
the
fool
of
the
family
by
the
powers
it
would
be
well
for
any
man
if
he
had
a
few
of
such
foolish
friends
about
him
continued
he
but
i
wo
blarney
you
peter
you
know
what
my
opinion
always
has
been
so
we
say
no
more
about
it
when
he
came
back
we
had
a
long
consultation
as
to
the
best
method
of
proceeding
to
obtain
employment
for
was
anxious
to
be
again
afloat
and
so
was
i
regretted
parting
with
my
sister
but
my
father
was
so
morose
and
that
i
had
no
pleasure
at
home
except
in
her
company
indeed
my
sister
was
of
opinion
that
it
would
be
better
if
i
were
away
as
my
father
misanthropy
now
unchecked
by
my
mother
appeared
to
have
increased
and
he
seemed
to
view
me
with
positive
dislike
it
was
therefore
agreed
unanimously
between
my
sister
and
me
and
who
was
always
of
our
councils
that
it
would
be
advisable
that
i
should
be
again
afloat
i
can
manage
him
much
better
when
alone
peter
i
shall
have
nothing
to
occupy
me
and
take
me
away
from
him
as
your
presence
does
now
and
painful
as
it
is
to
part
with
you
my
duty
to
my
father
and
my
wish
for
your
advancement
induce
me
to
request
that
you
will
if
possible
find
some
means
of
obtaining
employment
spoken
like
a
hero
as
ye
are
miss
ellen
notwithstanding
your
pretty
face
and
soft
eyes
said
and
now
peter
for
the
means
to
bring
it
about
if
i
can
get
a
ship
there
is
no
fear
for
you
as
i
shall
choose
you
for
my
lieutenant
but
how
is
that
to
be
managed
do
you
think
that
you
can
come
over
the
old
gentleman
at
eagle
park
at
all
events
i
try
replied
i
i
can
but
be
floored
accordingly
the
next
day
i
set
off
for
my
grandfather
and
was
put
down
at
the
lodge
at
the
usual
hour
about
eleven
i
walked
up
the
avenue
and
knocked
at
the
door
when
it
was
opened
i
perceived
a
hesitation
among
the
servants
and
a
constrained
air
which
i
did
not
like
i
inquired
after
lord
privilege
the
answer
was
that
he
was
pretty
well
but
did
not
see
body
is
my
uncle
here
said
i
yes
sir
replied
the
servant
with
a
significant
look
and
all
his
family
are
here
too
are
you
sure
that
i
can
not
see
my
said
i
laying
a
stress
upon
the
word
i
will
tell
him
that
you
are
here
sir
replied
the
man
but
even
that
is
against
orders
i
had
never
seen
my
uncle
since
i
was
a
child
and
could
not
even
recollect
him
my
cousins
or
my
aunt
i
had
never
met
with
in
a
minute
an
answer
was
brought
requesting
that
i
would
walk
into
the
library
when
i
was
ushered
in
i
found
myself
in
the
presence
of
lord
privilege
who
sat
in
his
usual
place
and
a
tall
gentleman
whom
i
knew
at
once
to
be
my
uncle
from
his
likeness
to
my
father
here
is
the
young
gentleman
my
lord
said
my
uncle
looking
at
me
sternly
heh
what
oh
i
recollect
well
child
so
you
been
behaving
very
ill
sorry
to
hear
it
behaving
ill
my
lord
replied
i
i
am
not
aware
of
having
so
done
reports
are
certainly
very
much
against
you
nephew
observed
my
uncle
drily
some
one
has
told
your
grandfather
what
has
much
displeased
him
i
know
nothing
about
it
myself
then
some
rascal
has
slandered
me
sir
replied
i
my
uncle
started
at
the
word
rascal
and
then
recovering
himself
replied
well
nephew
what
is
it
that
you
require
of
lord
privilege
for
i
presume
this
visit
is
not
without
a
cause
sir
replied
i
my
visit
to
lord
privilege
was
first
to
thank
him
for
having
procured
me
my
commission
as
lieutenant
and
to
request
the
favour
that
he
would
obtain
me
active
employment
which
a
line
from
him
will
effect
immediately
i
was
not
aware
nephew
that
you
had
been
made
lieutenant
but
i
agree
with
you
that
the
more
you
are
at
sea
the
better
his
lordship
shall
sign
the
letter
sit
down
shall
i
write
it
sir
said
i
to
my
uncle
i
know
what
to
say
yes
and
bring
it
to
me
when
it
is
written
i
felt
convinced
that
the
only
reason
which
induced
my
uncle
to
obtain
me
employment
was
the
idea
that
i
should
be
better
out
of
the
way
and
that
there
was
more
risk
at
sea
than
on
shore
i
took
a
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
as
follows
my
lord
may
i
request
that
your
lordship
will
be
pleased
to
appoint
the
bearer
of
this
to
a
ship
as
soon
as
convenient
as
i
wish
him
to
be
actively
employed
i
am
my
lord
c
why
not
mention
your
name
it
is
of
no
consequence
replied
i
as
it
will
be
delivered
in
person
and
that
will
insure
my
speedy
appointment
the
letter
was
placed
before
his
lordship
for
signature
it
was
with
some
difficulty
that
he
was
made
to
understand
that
he
was
to
sign
it
the
old
gentleman
appeared
much
more
imbecile
than
when
i
last
saw
him
i
thanked
him
folded
up
the
letter
and
put
it
in
my
pocket
at
last
he
looked
at
me
and
a
sudden
flash
of
recollection
appeared
to
come
across
his
mind
well
child
so
you
escaped
from
the
french
prison
heh
and
how
your
friend
what
is
his
name
heh
my
lord
cried
my
uncle
he
is
friend
then
sir
i
presume
it
is
to
you
that
i
am
indebted
for
all
the
inquiries
and
reports
which
are
so
industriously
circulated
in
ireland
the
tampering
with
my
servants
and
other
impertinences
i
did
not
choose
to
deny
the
truth
although
i
was
a
little
fluttered
by
the
sudden
manner
in
which
it
came
to
light
i
replied
i
never
tamper
with
any
people
servants
sir
no
said
he
but
you
employ
others
so
to
do
i
discovered
the
whole
of
your
proceedings
after
the
scoundrel
left
for
england
if
you
apply
the
word
scoundrel
captain
sir
in
his
name
i
contradict
it
as
you
please
sir
replied
my
uncle
in
a
passion
but
you
will
oblige
me
by
quitting
this
house
immediately
and
expect
nothing
more
either
from
the
present
or
the
future
lord
privilege
except
that
retaliation
which
your
infamous
conduct
has
deserved
i
felt
much
irritated
and
replied
very
sharply
from
the
present
lord
privilege
i
certainly
expect
nothing
more
neither
do
i
from
his
successor
but
after
your
death
uncle
i
expect
that
the
person
who
succeeds
to
the
title
will
do
all
he
can
for
your
humble
servant
i
wish
you
a
good
morning
uncle
my
uncle
eyes
flashed
fire
as
i
finished
my
speech
which
indeed
was
a
very
bold
and
a
very
foolish
one
too
as
it
afterwards
proved
i
hastened
out
of
the
room
not
only
from
the
fear
of
being
turned
out
of
the
house
before
all
the
servants
but
also
from
the
dread
that
my
letter
to
the
first
lord
might
be
taken
from
me
by
force
but
i
shall
never
forget
the
scowl
of
vengeance
which
crossed
my
uncle
brows
as
i
turned
round
and
looked
at
him
as
i
shut
the
door
i
found
my
way
out
without
the
assistance
of
the
servants
and
hastened
home
as
fast
as
i
could
said
i
on
my
return
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
the
sooner
you
hasten
to
town
with
this
letter
of
introduction
the
better
it
will
be
for
depend
upon
it
my
uncle
will
do
me
all
the
harm
that
he
can
i
then
repeated
to
him
all
that
had
passed
and
it
was
agreed
that
should
take
the
letter
which
having
reference
to
the
bearer
would
do
as
well
for
him
as
for
me
and
if
obtained
an
appointment
i
was
sure
not
only
of
being
one
of
his
lieutenants
but
also
of
sailing
with
a
dear
friend
the
next
morning
set
off
for
london
and
fortunately
saw
the
first
lord
the
day
after
his
arrival
which
was
a
levee
day
the
first
lord
received
the
letter
from
and
requested
him
to
sit
down
he
then
read
it
inquired
after
his
lordship
asked
whether
his
health
was
good
replied
that
with
the
blessing
of
god
his
lordship
might
live
many
years
that
he
had
never
heard
him
complain
of
ill
health
all
which
was
not
false
if
not
true
i
could
not
help
observing
to
when
he
returned
home
and
told
me
what
had
passed
that
i
thought
considering
what
he
had
expressed
with
respect
to
white
lies
and
black
lies
that
he
had
not
latterly
adhered
to
his
own
creed
that
very
true
peter
and
i
thought
of
it
myself
but
it
is
my
creed
nevertheless
we
all
know
what
right
but
we
do
always
follow
it
the
fact
is
i
begin
to
think
that
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
fight
the
world
with
its
own
weapons
i
spoke
to
father
on
the
subject
and
he
replied
if
anyone
by
doing
wrong
necessitated
another
to
do
wrong
to
circumvent
him
that
the
first
party
was
answerable
not
only
for
his
own
sin
but
also
for
the
sin
committed
in
but
i
do
not
fix
my
faith
so
implicitly
upon
father
and
i
do
not
much
admire
many
of
his
directions
no
more
do
i
peter
when
i
think
upon
them
but
how
am
i
to
puzzle
my
head
upon
these
points
all
i
know
is
that
when
you
are
divided
between
your
inclination
and
your
duty
it
mighty
convenient
to
have
a
priest
like
father
to
decide
for
you
and
to
look
after
your
soul
into
the
bargain
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
myself
when
finding
fault
with
had
in
the
instance
of
both
the
letters
from
lord
privilege
been
also
guilty
of
deceit
i
was
therefore
blaming
him
for
the
same
fault
committed
by
myself
and
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
too
ready
in
consoling
myself
with
father
maxim
that
one
might
do
evil
that
good
might
come
but
to
return
to
interview
after
some
little
conversation
the
first
lord
said
captain
i
am
always
very
ready
to
oblige
lord
privilege
and
the
more
so
as
his
recommendation
is
of
an
officer
of
your
merit
in
a
day
or
two
if
you
call
at
the
admiralty
you
will
hear
further
wrote
to
us
immediately
and
we
waited
with
impatience
for
his
next
letter
but
instead
of
the
letter
he
made
his
appearance
on
the
third
day
and
first
hugged
me
in
his
arms
he
then
came
to
my
sister
embraced
her
and
skipped
and
danced
about
the
room
what
is
the
matter
said
i
while
ellen
retreated
in
confusion
pulled
a
parchment
out
of
his
pocket
here
peter
my
dear
peter
now
for
honour
and
glory
an
brig
peter
the
captain
west
india
station
by
the
holy
father
my
heart
bursting
with
joy
and
down
he
sank
into
an
easy
chair
i
almost
beside
myself
inquired
he
after
a
short
pause
ellen
thinks
so
i
dare
say
replied
i
looking
at
my
sister
who
stood
in
the
corner
of
the
room
thinking
was
really
out
of
his
senses
and
still
red
with
confusion
who
then
called
to
mind
what
a
slip
of
decorum
he
had
been
guilty
of
immediately
rose
and
resuming
his
usual
unsophisticated
politeness
as
he
walked
up
to
my
sister
took
her
hand
and
said
excuse
me
my
dear
miss
ellen
i
must
apologize
for
my
rudeness
but
my
delight
was
so
great
and
my
gratitude
to
your
brother
so
intense
that
i
am
afraid
that
in
my
warmth
i
allowed
the
expression
of
my
feelings
to
extend
to
one
so
dear
to
him
and
so
like
him
in
person
and
in
mind
will
you
only
consider
that
you
received
the
overflowings
of
a
grateful
heart
towards
your
brother
and
for
his
sake
pardon
my
indiscretion
ellen
smiled
and
held
out
her
hand
to
who
led
her
to
the
sofa
where
we
all
three
sat
down
and
he
then
commenced
a
more
intelligible
narrative
of
what
had
passed
he
had
called
on
the
day
appointed
and
sent
up
his
card
the
first
lord
could
not
see
him
but
referred
him
to
the
private
secretary
who
presented
him
with
his
commission
to
the
brig
the
secretary
smiled
most
graciously
and
told
in
confidence
that
he
would
proceed
to
the
west
india
station
as
soon
as
his
vessel
was
manned
and
ready
for
sea
he
inquired
of
whom
he
wished
as
his
first
lieutenant
replied
that
he
wished
for
me
but
as
in
all
probability
i
should
not
be
of
sufficient
standing
to
be
first
lieutenant
that
the
admiralty
might
appoint
any
other
to
the
duty
provided
i
joined
the
ship
the
secretary
made
a
minute
of
wish
and
requested
him
if
he
had
a
vacancy
to
spare
as
midshipman
to
allow
him
to
send
one
on
board
to
which
willingly
acceded
shook
hands
with
him
and
quitted
the
admiralty
to
hasten
down
to
us
with
the
pleasing
intelligence
and
now
said
i
have
made
up
my
mind
how
to
proceed
i
shall
first
run
down
to
plymouth
and
hoist
my
pennant
then
i
shall
ask
for
a
fortnight
leave
and
go
to
ireland
to
see
how
they
get
on
and
what
father
may
be
about
so
peter
let
pass
this
evening
as
happily
as
we
can
for
though
you
and
i
shall
soon
meet
again
yet
it
may
be
years
or
perhaps
never
that
we
three
shall
sit
down
on
the
same
sofa
as
we
do
now
ellen
who
was
still
nervous
from
the
late
death
of
my
mother
looked
down
and
i
perceived
the
tears
start
in
her
eyes
at
the
remark
of
that
perhaps
we
should
never
meet
again
and
i
did
pass
a
happy
evening
i
had
a
dear
sister
on
one
side
of
me
and
a
sincere
friend
on
the
other
how
few
situations
more
enviable
left
us
early
the
next
morning
and
at
a
letter
was
handed
to
my
father
it
was
from
my
uncle
coldly
communicating
to
him
that
lord
privilege
had
died
the
night
before
very
suddenly
and
informing
him
that
the
burial
would
take
place
on
that
day
week
and
that
the
will
would
be
opened
immediately
after
the
funeral
my
father
handed
the
letter
over
to
me
without
saying
a
word
and
sipped
his
tea
with
his
i
can
not
say
that
i
felt
very
much
on
the
occasion
but
i
did
feel
because
he
had
been
kind
to
me
at
one
time
as
for
my
father
feelings
i
could
not
or
rather
i
should
say
i
did
not
wish
to
analyze
them
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
cup
of
tea
he
left
the
and
went
into
his
study
i
then
communicated
the
intelligence
to
my
sister
ellen
my
god
said
she
after
a
pause
putting
her
hand
up
to
her
eyes
what
a
strange
unnatural
state
of
society
must
we
have
arrived
at
when
my
father
can
thus
receive
the
intelligence
of
a
parent
death
is
it
not
dreadful
it
is
my
dearest
girl
replied
i
but
every
feeling
has
been
sacrificed
to
worldly
considerations
and
an
empty
name
the
younger
sons
have
been
neglected
if
not
deserted
virtue
talent
everything
set
at
naught
intrinsic
value
despised
and
the
only
claim
to
consideration
admitted
that
of
being
the
heir
entail
when
all
the
ties
of
nature
are
cast
loose
by
the
parents
can
you
be
surprised
if
the
children
are
no
longer
bound
by
them
most
truly
do
you
observe
that
it
is
a
detestable
state
of
society
i
did
not
say
detestable
brother
i
said
strange
and
unnatural
had
you
said
what
i
said
ellen
you
would
not
have
been
wrong
i
would
not
for
the
title
and
wealth
which
it
brings

the
heartless
isolated
i
may
say
neglected

that
my
grandfather
was
were
it
offered
now
i
would
not
barter
for
it
ellen
love
ellen
threw
herself
in
my
arms
we
then
walked
into
the
garden
where
we
had
a
long
conversation
relative
to
our
future
wishes
hopes
and
prospects
chapter

pompous
obsequies
the
reading
of
the
will
not
exactly
after
wilkie
i
am
left
a
legacy
what
becomes
of
it
my
father
very
warm
writes
a
sermon
to
cool
himself
i
join
brig
and
fall
in
with
swinburne
on
that
day
week
i
accompanied
my
father
to
eagle
park
to
assist
at
the
burial
of
lord
privilege
we
were
ushered
into
the
room
where
the
body
had
laid
in
state
for
three
days
the
black
hangings
the
lofty
plumes
the
rich
ornaments
on
the
coffin
and
the
number
of
wax
candles
with
which
the
room
was
lighted
produced
a
solemn
and
grand
effect
i
could
not
help
as
i
leaned
against
the
balustrade
before
the
coffin
and
thought
of
its
contents
calling
to
mind
when
my
poor
feelings
seemed
as
it
were
inclined
to
thaw
in
my
favour
when
he
called
me
his
child
and
in
all
probability
had
not
my
uncle
had
a
son
would
have
died
in
my
arms
fond
and
attached
to
me
for
my
own
sake
independently
of
worldly
considerations
i
felt
that
had
i
known
him
longer
i
could
have
loved
him
and
that
he
would
have
loved
me
and
i
thought
to
myself
how
little
all
these
empty
honours
after
his
decease
could
compensate
for
the
loss
of
those
reciprocal
feelings
which
would
have
so
added
to
his
happiness
during
his
existence
but
he
had
lived
for
pomp
and
vanity
and
pomp
and
vanity
attended
him
to
his
grave
i
thought
of
my
sister
ellen
and
of
and
walked
away
with
the
conviction
that
peter
simple
might
have
been
an
object
of
envy
to
the
late
right
honourable
lord
viscount
privilege
baron
corston
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
and
one
of
his
majesty
most
honourable
privy
councillors
when
the
funeral
which
was
very
tedious
and
very
splendid
was
over
we
all
returned
in
the
carriages
to
eagle
park
when
my
uncle
who
had
of
course
assumed
the
title
and
who
had
attended
as
chief
mourner
was
in
waiting
to
receive
us
we
were
shown
into
the
library
and
in
the
chair
so
lately
and
constantly
occupied
by
my
grandfather
sat
the
new
lord
near
to
him
were
the
lawyers
with
parchments
lying
before
them
as
we
severally
entered
he
waved
his
hand
to
unoccupied
chairs
intimating
to
us
to
sit
down
but
no
words
were
exchanged
except
an
occasional
whisper
between
him
and
the
lawyers
when
all
the
branches
of
the
family
were
present
down
to
the
fourth
and
fifth
cousins
the
lawyer
on
the
right
of
my
uncle
put
on
his
spectacles
and
unrolling
the
parchment
commenced
reading
the
will
i
paid
attention
to
it
at
first
but
the
legal
technicalities
puzzled
me
and
i
was
soon
thinking
of
other
matters
until
after
half
an
hour
reading
i
was
startled
at
the
sound
of
my
own
name
it
was
a
bequest
by
codicil
to
me
of
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
pounds
my
father
who
sat
by
me
gave
me
a
slight
push
to
attract
my
attention
and
i
perceived
that
his
face
was
not
quite
so
mournful
as
before
i
was
rejoicing
at
this
unexpected
intelligence
i
called
to
mind
what
my
father
had
said
to
me
when
we
were
returning
from
eagle
park
that
my
grandfather
attentions
to
me
were
as
good
as
ten
thousand
pounds
in
his
will
and
was
reflecting
how
strange
it
was
that
he
had
hit
upon
the
exact
sum
i
also
thought
of
what
my
father
had
said
of
his
own
affairs
and
his
not
having
saved
anything
for
his
children
and
congratulated
myself
that
i
should
now
be
able
to
support
my
dear
sister
ellen
in
case
of
any
accident
happening
to
my
father
when
i
was
roused
by
another
mention
of
my
name
it
was
a
codicil
dated
about
a
week
back
in
which
my
grandfather
not
pleased
at
my
conduct
revoked
the
former
codicil
and
left
me
nothing
i
knew
where
the
blow
came
from
and
i
looked
my
uncle
in
the
face
a
gleam
of
malignant
pleasure
was
in
his
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
on
me
waiting
to
receive
my
glance
i
returned
it
with
a
smile
expressive
of
scorn
and
contempt
and
then
looked
at
my
father
who
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
misery
his
head
had
fallen
upon
his
breast
and
his
hands
were
clasped
although
i
was
shocked
at
the
blow
for
i
knew
how
much
the
money
was
required
i
felt
too
proud
to
show
it
indeed
i
felt
that
i
would
not
for
worlds
have
exchanged
situations
with
my
uncle
much
less
feelings
for
when
those
who
remain
meet
to
ascertain
the
disposition
made
by
one
who
is
summoned
away
to
the
tribunal
of
his
maker
of
those
worldly
and
perishable
things
which
he
must
leave
behind
him
feelings
of
rancour
and
might
for
the
time
be
permitted
to
subside
and
the
memory
of
a
departed
brother
be
productive
of
charity
and
after
a
little
reflection
i
felt
that
i
could
forgive
my
uncle
not
so
my
father
the
codicil
which
deprived
me
of
my
inheritance
was
the
last
of
the
will
and
the
lawyer
rolled
up
the
parchment
and
took
off
his
spectacles
everybody
rose
my
father
seized
his
hat
and
telling
me
in
a
harsh
voice
to
follow
him
tore
off
the
crape
weepers
and
then
threw
them
on
the
floor
as
he
walked
away
i
also
took
off
mine
and
laid
them
on
the
table
and
followed
him
my
father
called
his
carriage
waited
in
the
hall
till
it
was
driven
up
and
jumped
into
it
i
followed
him
he
drew
up
the
blind
and
desired
them
to
drive
home
not
a
sixpence
by
the
god
of
heaven
not
a
sixpence
my
name
not
even
mentioned
except
for
a
paltry
mourning
ring
and
yours
pray
sir
what
have
you
been
about
after
having
such
a
sum
left
you
to
forfeit
your
grandfather
good
opinion
heh
sir
tell
me
directly
continued
he
turning
round
to
me
in
a
rage
nothing
my
dear
father
that
i
aware
of
my
uncle
is
evidently
my
enemy
and
why
should
he
be
particularly
your
enemy
peter
there
must
be
some
reason
for
his
having
induced
your
grandfather
to
alter
his
bequest
in
your
favour
i
insist
upon
it
sir
that
you
tell
me
immediately
my
dear
father
when
you
are
more
calm
i
will
talk
this
matter
over
with
you
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
considered
wanting
in
respect
when
i
say
that
as
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
d
n
the
church
of
england
and
those
that
put
me
into
it
replied
my
father
maddened
with
rage
i
was
shocked
and
held
my
tongue
my
father
appeared
also
to
be
confused
at
his
hasty
expressions
he
sank
back
in
his
carriage
and
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
until
we
arrived
at
our
own
door
as
soon
as
we
entered
my
father
hastened
to
his
own
room
and
i
went
up
to
my
sister
ellen
who
was
in
her
bed
room
i
revealed
to
her
all
that
had
passed
and
advised
with
her
on
the
propriety
of
my
communicating
to
my
father
the
reasons
which
had
occasioned
my
uncle
extreme
aversion
towards
me
after
much
argument
she
agreed
with
me
that
the
disclosure
had
now
become
necessary
after
the
had
been
removed
i
then
communicated
to
my
father
the
circumstances
which
had
come
to
our
knowledge
relative
to
my
uncle
establishment
in
ireland
he
heard
me
very
attentively
took
out
tablets
and
made
notes
well
peter
said
he
after
a
few
minutes
silence
when
i
had
finished
i
see
clearly
through
this
whole
business
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
a
child
has
been
substituted
to
defraud
you
and
me
of
our
just
inheritance
of
the
title
and
estates
but
i
will
now
set
to
work
and
try
if
i
can
not
find
out
the
secret
and
with
the
help
of
captain
and
father
i
think
it
is
not
at
all
impossible
will
do
all
that
he
can
sir
replied
i
and
i
expect
soon
to
hear
from
him
he
must
have
now
been
a
week
in
ireland
i
shall
go
there
myself
replied
my
father
and
there
are
no
means
that
i
will
not
resort
to
to
discover
this
infamous
plot
no
exclaimed
he
striking
his
fist
on
the
table
so
as
to
shiver
two
of
the
into
fragments
no
means
but
i
will
resort
to
that
is
replied
i
my
dear
father
no
means
which
may
be
legitimately
employed
by
one
of
your
profession
i
tell
you
no
means
that
can
be
used
by
to
recover
his
defrauded
rights
tell
me
not
of
legitimate
means
when
i
am
to
lose
a
title
and
property
by
a
spurious
and
illegitimate
substitution
by
the
god
of
heaven
i
will
meet
them
with
fraud
for
fraud
with
false
swearing
for
false
swearing
and
with
blood
for
blood
if
it
should
be
necessary
my
brother
has
dissolved
all
ties
and
i
will
have
my
right
even
if
i
demand
it
with
a
pistol
at
his
ear
for
heaven
sake
my
dear
father
do
not
be
so
violent
recollect
your
profession
i
do
replied
he
bitterly
and
how
i
was
forced
into
it
against
my
will
i
recollect
my
father
words
the
solemn
coolness
with
which
he
told
me
had
my
choice
of
the
church
or
to
starve
but
i
have
my
sermon
to
prepare
for
and
i
can
sit
here
no
longer
tell
ellen
to
send
me
in
some
tea
i
did
not
think
my
father
was
in
a
very
fit
state
of
mind
to
write
a
sermon
but
i
held
my
tongue
my
sister
joined
me
and
we
saw
no
more
of
him
till
breakfast
the
next
day
before
we
met
i
received
a
letter
from
my
dear
peter
i
ran
down
to
plymouth
hoisted
my
pennant
drew
my
jollies
from
the
dockyard
and
set
my
first
lieutenant
to
work
getting
in
the
ballast
and
i
then
set
off
for
ireland
and
was
very
well
received
as
captain
by
my
family
who
were
all
flourishing
now
that
my
two
sisters
are
so
well
married
off
my
father
and
mother
are
very
comfortable
but
rather
lonely
for
i
believe
i
told
you
long
before
that
it
had
pleased
heaven
to
take
all
the
rest
of
my
brothers
and
sisters
except
the
two
now
married
and
one
who
bore
up
for
a
nunnery
dedicating
her
service
to
god
after
she
was
scarred
with
the
and
no
man
would
look
at
her
ever
since
the
family
have
been
grown
up
my
father
and
mother
have
been
lamenting
and
sorrowing
that
none
of
them
would
go
off
and
now
that
they
all
gone
off
one
way
or
another
they
cry
all
day
because
they
are
left
all
alone
with
no
one
to
keep
company
with
them
except
father
and
the
pigs
we
never
are
to
be
contented
in
this
world
that
sartain
and
now
that
they
are
comfortable
in
every
respect
they
find
that
they
are
very
uncomfortable
and
having
obtained
all
their
wishes
they
wish
everything
back
again
but
as
old
maddocks
used
to
say
good
growl
is
better
than
a
bad
dinner
with
some
people
and
the
greatest
pleasure
that
they
now
have
is
to
grumble
and
if
that
makes
them
happy
they
must
be
happy
all
day
long
for
the
devil
a
bit
do
they
leave
off
from
morning
till
night
the
first
thing
that
i
did
was
to
send
for
father
who
had
been
more
away
from
home
than
usual
i
presume
not
finding
things
quite
so
comfortable
as
they
used
to
be
he
told
me
that
he
had
met
with
father
and
had
a
bit
of
a
dialogue
with
him
which
had
ended
in
a
bit
of
a
row
and
that
he
had
cudgelled
father
well
and
tore
his
gown
off
his
back
and
then
tore
it
into
shivers
that
father
had
referred
the
case
to
the
bishop
and
that
was
how
the
matter
stood
just
then
says
he
spalpeen
has
left
this
part
of
the
country
and
what
is
more
has
taken
ella
and
her
mother
with
him
and
what
is
still
worse
no
one
could
find
out
where
they
were
gone
but
it
was
believed
that
they
had
all
been
sent
over
the
water
so
you
see
peter
that
this
is
a
bad
job
in
one
point
which
is
that
we
have
no
chance
of
getting
the
truth
out
of
the
old
woman
for
now
that
we
have
war
with
france
who
is
to
follow
them
on
the
other
hand
it
is
good
news
for
it
prevents
me
from
decoying
that
poor
young
girl
and
making
her
believe
what
will
never
come
to
pass
and
i
am
not
a
little
glad
on
that
score
for
father
was
told
by
those
who
were
about
her
that
she
did
nothing
but
weep
and
moan
for
two
days
before
she
went
away
scolded
as
she
was
by
her
mother
and
threatened
by
that
blackguard
it
appears
to
me
that
all
our
hopes
now
are
in
finding
out
the
soldier
and
his
wife
the
who
were
sent
to
india
no
doubt
with
the
hope
that
the
climate
and
the
fevers
may
carry
them
off
that
uncle
of
yours
is
a
great
blackguard
every
bit
of
him
i
shall
leave
here
in
three
days
and
you
must
join
me
at
plymouth
make
my
compliments
to
your
father
and
my
regards
to
your
sister
whom
may
all
the
saints
preserve
god
bless
her
for
ever
and
ever
amen
yours
ever
terence
i
put
this
letter
into
my
father
hands
when
he
came
out
of
his
room
this
is
a
plot
said
he
and
i
think
we
must
immediately
do
as
states
look
after
the
nurse
who
was
sent
to
india
do
you
know
the
regiment
to
which
her
husband
belongs
yes
sir
replied
i
it
is
the
and
she
sailed
for
india
about
three
months
back
the
name
you
say
i
think
is
said
he
pulling
out
his
tablets
well
i
will
write
immediately
to
captain
fielding
and
beg
him
to
make
the
minutest
inquiries
i
will
also
write
to
your
sister
lucy
for
women
are
much
keener
than
men
in
affairs
of
this
sort
if
the
regiment
is
ordered
to
ceylon
all
the
better
if
not
he
must
obtain
furlough
to
prosecute
his
inquiries
when
that
is
done
i
will
go
myself
to
ireland
and
try
if
we
can
not
trace
the
other
parties
my
father
then
left
the
room
and
i
retired
with
ellen
to
make
preparations
for
joining
my
ship
at
plymouth
a
letter
announcing
my
appointment
had
come
down
and
i
had
written
to
request
my
commission
to
be
forwarded
to
the
clerk
of
the
cheque
at
plymouth
that
i
might
save
a
useless
journey
to
london
on
the
following
day
i
parted
with
my
father
and
my
dear
sister
and
without
any
adventure
arrived
at
plymouth
dock
where
i
met
with
the
same
day
i
reported
myself
to
the
admiral
and
joined
my
brig
which
was
lying
alongside
the
hulk
with
her
topmasts
pointed
through
returning
from
the
brig
as
i
was
walking
up
i
observed
a
fine
stout
sailor
whose
back
was
turned
to
me
reading
the
handbill
which
had
been
posted
up
everywhere
announcing
that
the
captain
about
to
proceed
to
the
west
india
station
where
were
so
plentiful
that
dollars
were
only
used
for
ballast
was
in
want
of
a
stout
hands
it
might
have
been
said
of
a
great
many
for
we
had
not
entered
six
men
and
were
doing
all
the
work
with
the
marines
and
riggers
of
the
dockyard
but
it
is
not
the
custom
to
show
your
poverty
in
this
world
either
with
regard
to
men
or
money
i
stopped
and
overheard
him
say
ay
as
for
the
doubloons
that
cock
wo
fight
i
served
long
enough
in
the
west
indies
not
to
be
humbugged
but
i
wonder
whether
captain
was
the
second
lieutenant
of
the
if
so
i
should
mind
trying
a
cruise
with
him
i
thought
that
i
recollected
the
voice
and
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
he
turned
round
and
it
proved
to
be
swinburne
what
swinburne
said
i
shaking
him
by
the
hand
for
i
was
delighted
to
see
him
is
it
you
why
mr
simple
well
then
i
expect
that
i
right
and
that
mr
is
made
and
commands
this
craft
when
you
meet
the
the
shark
ar
far
off
you
know
you
very
right
swinburne
said
i
in
all
except
calling
captain
a
shark
he
no
shark
no
that
he
ar
except
in
one
way
that
is
that
i
expect
he
soon
show
his
teeth
to
the
frenchmen
but
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
and
swinburne
took
off
his
hat
oh
i
understand
you
did
not
perceive
before
that
i
had
shipped
the
swab
yes
i
lieutenant
of
the
swinburne
and
hope
you
join
us
there
my
hand
upon
it
mr
simple
said
he
smacking
his
great
fist
into
mine
so
as
to
make
it
tingle
i
content
if
i
know
that
the
captain
a
good
officer
but
when
there
two
i
think
myself
lucky
i
just
take
a
boat
and
put
my
name
on
the
books
and
then
i
be
on
shore
again
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
money
and
try
if
i
ca
pick
up
a
few
hands
as
volunteers
for
i
know
where
they
all
be
stowed
away
i
was
looking
at
the
craft
this
morning
and
rather
took
a
fancy
to
her
she
has
a
d
d
pretty
run
but
i
hope
captain
will
take
off
her
and
get
one
carved
i
never
knew
a
vessel
do
much
with
a
i
rather
think
that
captain
has
already
applied
to
the
commissioner
on
the
subject
replied
i
at
all
events
it
wo
be
very
difficult
to
make
the
alteration
ourselves
to
be
sure
not
replied
swinburne
a
coil
of
will
make
the
body
of
the
snake
i
can
carve
out
the
head
and
as
for
a
i
be
blessed
if
i
do
rob
one
of
those
beggars
of
watchmen
this
very
night
so
mr
simple
till
we
meet
again
swinburne
kept
his
word
he
joined
the
ship
that
afternoon
and
the
next
day
came
off
with
six
good
hands
who
had
been
induced
from
his
representations
to
join
the
brig
tell
captain
said
he
to
me
not
to
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
man
his
ship
i
know
where
there
are
plenty
to
be
had
but
i
try
fair
means
first
this
he
did
and
every
day
almost
he
brought
off
a
man
and
all
he
did
bring
off
were
good
able
seamen
others
volunteered
and
we
were
now
more
than
and
ready
for
sea
the
admiral
then
gave
us
permission
to
send
pressgangs
on
shore
mr
simple
said
swinburne
i
tried
all
i
can
to
persuade
a
lot
of
fine
chaps
to
enter
but
they
wo
now
i
resolved
that
my
brig
shall
be
well
manned
and
if
they
do
know
what
good
for
them
i
do
and
i
sure
that
they
will
thank
me
for
it
afterwards
so
i
determined
to
take
every
mother
son
of
them
the
same
night
we
mustered
all
swinburne
men
and
went
on
shore
to
a
crimp
house
which
they
knew
surrounded
it
with
our
marines
in
blue
jackets
and
took
out
of
it
fine
able
seamen
which
nearly
filled
up
our
complement
the
remainder
we
obtained
by
a
draft
from
the
admiral
ship
and
i
do
not
believe
that
there
was
a
vessel
that
left
plymouth
harbour
and
anchored
in
the
sound
better
manned
than
the
so
much
for
good
character
which
is
never
lost
upon
seamen
was
universally
liked
by
those
who
had
sailed
with
him
and
swinburne
who
knew
him
well
persuaded
many
and
forced
the
others
to
enter
with
him
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
this
they
in
the
event
did
and
with
the
exception
of
those
drafted
from
the
we
had
no
desertions
indeed
none
deserted
whom
we
would
have
wished
to
retain
and
their
vacancies
were
soon
filled
up
with
better
men
chapter
xlii
we
sail
for
the
west
indies
a
volunteer
for
the
ship
refused
and
set
on
shore
again
for
reasons
which
the
chapter
will
satisfactorily
explain
to
the
reader
we
were
very
glad
when
the
came
on
board
to
take
us
into
the
sound
and
still
more
glad
to
perceive
that
the
brig
which
had
just
been
launched
before
was
appointed
to
her
appeared
to
sail
very
fast
as
she
ran
out
so
it
proved
after
we
went
to
sea
she
sailed
wonderfully
well
beating
every
vessel
that
she
met
and
overhauling
in
a
very
short
time
everything
that
we
chased
turning
to
windward
like
magic
and
tacking
in
a
moment
three
days
after
we
anchored
in
the
sound
the
ship
company
were
paid
and
our
sailing
orders
came
down
to
proceed
with
despatches
by
next
evening
post
to
the
island
of
jamaica
we
started
with
a
fair
wind
and
were
soon
clear
of
the
channel
our
whole
time
was
now
occupied
in
training
our
new
company
at
the
guns
and
learning
them
pull
together
and
by
the
time
that
we
had
run
down
the
trades
we
were
in
a
very
fair
state
of
discipline
the
first
lieutenant
was
rather
an
odd
character
his
brother
was
a
sporting
man
of
large
property
and
he
had
contracted
from
his
example
a
great
partiality
for
such
pursuits
he
knew
the
winning
horses
of
the
derby
and
the
oaks
for
twenty
years
back
was
an
adept
at
all
athletic
exercises
a
capital
shot
and
had
his
pointer
on
board
in
other
respects
he
was
a
great
dandy
in
his
person
always
wore
gloves
even
on
service
very
gentlemanlike
and
handsome
and
not
a
very
bad
sailor
that
is
he
knew
enough
to
carry
on
his
duty
very
creditably
and
evidently
now
that
he
was
the
first
lieutenant
and
obliged
to
work
learnt
more
of
his
duty
every
day
i
never
met
a
more
pleasant
messmate
or
a
more
honourable
young
man
a
brig
is
only
allowed
two
lieutenants
the
master
was
a
rough
intelligent
young
man
always
in
good
humour
the
surgeon
and
purser
completed
our
mess
they
were
men
of
no
character
at
all
except
perhaps
that
the
surgeon
was
too
much
of
a
courtier
and
the
purser
too
much
of
a
but
pursers
are
generally
speaking
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
but
i
have
been
led
away
while
talking
of
the
brig
and
the
officers
and
had
almost
forgotten
to
narrate
a
circumstance
which
occurred
two
days
before
we
sailed
i
was
with
in
the
cabin
when
mr
osbaldistone
the
first
lieutenant
came
in
and
reported
that
a
boy
had
come
on
board
to
volunteer
for
the
ship
what
sort
of
a
lad
is
he
said
a
very
nice
lad
very
slight
sir
replied
the
first
lieutenant
we
have
two
vacancies
well
see
what
you
make
of
him
and
if
you
think
he
will
do
you
may
put
him
on
the
books
i
have
tried
him
sir
he
says
that
he
has
been
a
short
time
at
sea
i
made
him
mount
the
but
he
did
not
much
like
it
well
do
as
you
please
osbaldistone
replied
and
the
first
lieutenant
quitted
the
cabin
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
returned
if
you
please
sir
said
he
laughing
i
sent
the
boy
down
to
the
surgeon
to
be
examined
and
he
refused
to
strip
the
surgeon
says
that
he
thinks
she
is
a
woman
i
have
had
her
up
on
the
and
she
refuses
to
answer
any
questions
and
requires
to
speak
with
you
with
me
said
with
surprise
oh
one
of
the
men
wives
i
suppose
trying
to
steal
a
march
upon
us
well
send
her
down
here
osbaldistone
and
i
prove
to
her
the
moral
impossibility
of
her
sailing
in
his
majesty
brig
in
a
few
minutes
the
first
lieutenant
sent
her
down
to
the
cabin
door
and
i
was
about
to
retire
as
she
entered
but
stopped
me
stay
peter
my
reputation
will
be
at
stake
if
i
left
all
alone
said
he
laughing
the
sentry
opened
the
door
and
whether
boy
or
girl
a
more
interesting
face
i
never
beheld
the
hair
was
cut
close
and
i
could
not
tell
whether
the
surgeon
suspicions
were
correct
you
wish
to
speak
holy
st
patrick
cried
looking
earnestly
at
her
features
and
covered
his
face
and
bent
over
the
table
exclaiming
my
god
my
god
in
the
meantime
the
colour
of
the
young
person
fled
from
her
countenance
and
then
rushed
into
it
again
alternately
leaving
it
pale
and
suffused
with
blushes
i
perceived
a
trembling
over
the
frame
the
knees
shook
and
knocked
together
and
had
i
not
hastened
she
for
a
female
it
was
would
have
fallen
on
the
deck
i
perceived
that
she
had
fainted
i
therefore
laid
her
down
on
the
deck
and
hastened
to
obtain
some
water
ran
up
and
went
to
her
my
poor
poor
girl
said
he
sorrowfully
oh
peter
this
is
all
your
fault
all
my
fault
how
could
she
have
come
here
by
all
the
saints
who
pray
for
us
dearly
as
i
prize
them
i
would
give
up
my
ship
and
my
commission
that
this
could
be
undone
as
hung
over
her
the
tears
from
his
eyes
fell
upon
her
face
while
i
bathed
it
with
the
water
i
had
brought
from
the
i
knew
who
it
must
be
although
i
had
never
seen
her
it
was
the
girl
to
whom
had
professed
love
to
worm
out
the
secret
of
the
exchange
of
my
uncle
child
and
as
i
beheld
the
scene
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
who
now
will
assert
that
evil
may
be
done
that
good
may
come
the
poor
girl
showed
symptoms
of
recovering
and
waved
his
hand
to
me
saying
leave
us
peter
and
see
that
no
one
comes
in
i
remained
nearly
an
hour
at
the
by
the
sentry
and
prevented
many
from
entering
when
opened
the
door
and
requested
me
to
order
his
gig
to
be
manned
and
then
to
come
in
the
poor
girl
had
evidently
been
weeping
bitterly
and
was
much
affected
all
is
arranged
peter
you
must
go
on
shore
with
her
and
not
leave
her
till
you
see
her
safe
off
by
the
night
coach
do
me
that
favour
peter
you
ought
indeed
continued
he
in
a
low
voice
for
you
have
been
partly
the
occasion
of
this
i
shook
hand
and
made
no
answer
the
boat
was
reported
ready
and
the
girl
followed
me
with
a
firm
step
i
pulled
on
shore
saw
her
safe
in
the
coach
without
asking
her
any
question
and
then
returned
on
board
come
on
board
sir
said
i
entering
the
cabin
with
my
hat
in
my
hand
and
reporting
myself
according
to
the
regulations
of
the
service
thank
you
replied
shut
the
door
peter
tell
me
how
did
she
behave
what
did
she
say
she
never
spoke
and
i
never
asked
her
a
question
she
seemed
to
be
willing
to
do
as
you
had
arranged
sit
down
peter
i
never
felt
more
unhappy
or
more
disgusted
with
myself
in
all
my
life
i
feel
as
if
i
never
could
be
happy
again
a
sailor
life
mixes
him
up
with
the
worst
part
of
the
female
sex
and
we
do
not
know
the
real
value
of
the
better
i
little
thought
when
i
was
talking
nonsense
to
that
poor
girl
that
i
was
breaking
one
of
the
kindest
hearts
in
the
world
and
sacrificing
the
happiness
of
one
who
would
lay
down
her
existence
for
me
peter
since
you
have
been
gone
it
twenty
times
that
i
looked
in
the
glass
just
to
see
whether
i
do
look
like
a
villain
but
by
the
blood
of
st
patrick
i
thought
woman
was
just
like
our
own
and
that
a
three
months
cruise
would
set
all
to
rights
again
i
thought
she
had
gone
over
to
france
so
did
i
but
now
she
has
told
me
all
about
it
father
and
her
mother
brought
her
down
to
the
coast
near
here
to
embark
in
a
smuggling
boat
for
dieppe
when
the
boat
pulled
in
the
night
to
take
them
in
the
mother
and
the
rascally
priest
got
in
but
she
felt
as
if
it
was
leaving
the
whole
world
to
leave
the
country
i
was
in
and
she
held
back
the
officers
came
down
one
or
two
pistols
were
fired
and
the
boat
shoved
off
without
her
and
she
with
their
luggage
was
left
on
the
beach
she
went
back
to
the
next
town
with
the
officers
where
she
told
the
truth
of
the
story
and
they
let
her
go
in
father
luggage
she
found
letters
which
she
read
and
found
out
that
she
and
her
mother
were
to
have
been
placed
in
a
convent
at
dieppe
and
as
the
convent
was
named
in
the
letters
which
she
says
are
very
important
but
i
have
not
had
courage
to
read
them
yet
she
went
to
the
people
from
whose
house
they
had
embarked
requesting
them
to
forward
the
luggage
and
a
letter
to
her
mother
sending
everything
but
the
letters
which
she
reserved
for
me
she
has
since
received
a
letter
from
her
mother
telling
her
that
she
is
safe
and
well
in
the
convent
and
begging
her
to
come
over
to
her
as
soon
as
possible
the
mother
took
the
vows
a
week
after
she
arrived
there
so
we
know
where
to
find
her
peter
and
where
is
the
poor
girl
going
to
stay
now
that
all
the
worst
part
of
it
it
appears
that
she
hoped
not
to
be
found
out
till
after
we
had
sailed
and
then
to
have
as
she
said
poor
thing
to
have
laid
at
my
feet
and
watched
over
me
in
the
storms
but
i
pointed
out
to
her
that
it
was
not
permitted
and
that
i
would
not
be
allowed
to
marry
her
o
peter
this
is
a
very
sad
business
continued
passing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
well
but
what
is
to
become
of
the
poor
girl
she
is
going
home
to
be
with
my
father
and
mother
hoping
one
day
that
i
shall
come
back
and
marry
her
i
have
written
to
father
to
see
what
he
can
do
have
you
then
not
undeceived
her
father
must
do
that
i
could
not
it
would
have
been
the
death
of
her
it
would
have
stabbed
her
to
the
heart
and
it
not
for
me
to
give
that
blow
i
sooner
have
died
sooner
have
married
her
than
have
done
it
peter
perhaps
when
i
far
away
she
bear
it
better
father
will
manage
it
i
do
like
that
father
well
peter
you
may
be
right
i
do
exactly
like
all
he
says
myself
but
what
is
a
man
to
do
either
he
is
a
catholic
and
believes
as
a
catholic
or
he
is
not
one
will
i
abandon
my
religion
now
that
it
is
persecuted
never
peter
i
hope
not
without
i
find
a
much
better
at
all
events
still
i
do
not
like
to
feel
that
this
advice
of
my
confessor
is
at
variance
with
my
own
conscience
father
is
a
worldly
man
but
that
only
proves
that
he
is
wrong
not
that
our
religion
is
and
i
do
mind
speaking
to
you
on
this
subject
no
one
knows
that
i
a
catholic
except
yourself
and
at
the
admiralty
they
never
asked
me
to
take
that
oath
which
i
never
would
have
taken
although
father
says
i
may
take
any
oath
i
please
with
what
he
calls
heretics
and
he
will
grant
me
absolution
peter
my
dear
fellow
say
no
more
about
it
i
did
not
but
i
may
as
well
end
the
history
of
poor
ella
flanagan
at
once
as
she
will
not
appear
again
about
three
months
afterwards
we
received
a
letter
from
father
stating
that
the
girl
had
arrived
safe
and
had
been
a
great
comfort
to
father
and
mother
who
wished
her
to
remain
with
them
altogether
that
father
had
told
her
that
when
a
man
took
his
commission
as
captain
it
was
all
the
same
as
going
into
a
monastery
as
a
monk
for
he
never
could
marry
the
poor
girl
believed
him
and
thinking
that
was
lost
to
her
for
ever
with
the
advice
of
father
had
entered
as
a
nun
in
one
of
the
religious
houses
in
ireland
that
as
she
said
she
might
pray
for
him
night
and
day
many
years
afterwards
we
heard
of
her
she
was
well
and
not
unhappy
but
never
forgot
his
behaviour
to
this
poor
girl
it
was
a
source
of
continual
regret
and
i
believe
until
the
last
day
of
his
existence
his
heart
smote
him
for
his
inconsiderate
conduct
towards
her
but
i
must
leave
this
distressing
topic
and
return
to
the
which
had
now
arrived
at
the
west
indies
and
joined
the
admiral
at
jamaica

we
found
orders
at
barbadoes
to
cruise
off
martinique
to
prevent
supplies
being
furnished
to
the
garrison
of
the
island
and
we
proceeded
there
immediately
i
do
not
know
anything
more
picturesque
than
running
down
the
east
side
of
this
beautiful
island
the
ridges
of
hill
spreading
down
to
the
water
edge
covered
with
the
freshest
verdure
divided
at
the
base
by
small
bays
with
the
beach
of
dazzling
white
sand
and
where
the
little
coasting
vessels
employed
to
bring
the
sugar
from
the
neighbouring
estates
were
riding
at
anchor
each
hill
at
its
adjutment
towards
the
sea
crowned
with
a
fort
on
which
waved
the
certainly
in
appearance
one
of
the
most
flags
in
the
world
on
the
third
morning
we
had
rounded
the
diamond
rock
and
were
scudding
along
the
of
the
island
just
opening
fort
royal
bay
when
hauling
rather
too
close
round
its
eastern
entrance
formed
by
a
promontory
called
solomon
point
which
was
covered
with
we
found
ourselves
nearer
than
agreeable
to
a
newly
constructed
battery
a
column
of
smoke
was
poured
along
the
blue
water
and
it
was
followed
by
the
whizzing
of
a
shot
which
passed
through
our
boom
main
sail
first
cutting
away
the
which
was
close
to
old
swinburne
head
as
he
stood
on
the
carronade
conning
the
brig
i
was
at
dinner
in
the
cabin
with
and
the
first
lieutenant
where
the
devil
have
they
got
the
brig
now
said
rising
from
his
chair
and
going
on
deck
we
both
followed
but
before
we
were
on
deck
three
or
four
more
shot
passed
between
the
masts
if
you
please
sir
said
the
master
mate
in
charge
of
the
deck
whose
name
was
the
battery
has
opened
upon
us
thank
you
very
much
for
your
information
mr
replied
but
the
french
have
reported
it
before
you
may
i
ask
if
you
any
particular
fancy
to
be
made
a
target
of
or
if
you
think
that
his
majesty
brig
was
sent
here
to
be
riddled
for
nothing
at
all
starboard
the
helm
quartermaster
the
helm
was
put
up
and
the
brig
was
soon
run
out
of
the
fire
not
however
until
a
few
more
shot
were
pitched
close
to
us
and
one
carried
away
the
foretopmast
backstay
now
mr
replied
i
only
wish
to
point
out
to
you
that
i
trust
neither
i
nor
any
one
in
this
ship
cares
a
fig
about
the
whizzing
of
a
shot
or
two
about
our
ears
when
there
is
anything
to
be
gained
for
it
either
for
ourselves
or
for
our
country
but
i
do
care
a
great
deal
about
losing
even
the
leg
or
the
arm
much
more
the
life
of
any
of
my
men
when
there
no
occasion
for
it
so
in
future
recollect
it
no
disgrace
to
keep
out
of
the
way
of
a
battery
when
all
the
advantage
is
on
their
side
i
always
observed
that
chance
shots
pick
out
the
best
men
lower
down
the
mainsail
and
send
the
sailmakers
aft
to
repair
it
when
returned
to
the
cabin
i
remained
on
deck
for
it
was
my
afternoon
watch
and
although
had
permission
to
look
out
for
me
i
did
not
choose
to
go
down
again
the
bay
of
fort
royal
was
now
opened
and
the
view
was
extremely
beautiful
swinburne
was
still
on
the
carronade
and
as
i
knew
he
had
been
there
before
i
applied
to
him
for
information
as
to
the
he
told
me
the
names
of
the
batteries
above
the
town
pointed
out
fort
edward
and
negro
point
and
particularly
pigeon
island
the
battery
at
the
top
of
which
wore
the
appearance
of
a
mural
crown
it
well
i
remember
that
place
mr
simple
said
he
it
was
in
when
i
was
last
here
the
sodgers
had
it
for
a
whole
month
and
were
about
to
give
it
up
they
could
get
a
gun
up
on
that
hill
you
see
there
so
poor
captain
faulkner
says
many
a
clear
head
under
a
tarpaulin
hat
and
i
give
any
chap
five
doubloons
that
will
hitch
up
a
pounder
to
the
top
of
that
hill
not
quite
so
easy
a
matter
as
you
may
perceive
from
here
mr
simple
it
certainly
appears
to
me
to
have
been
almost
impossible
swinburne
replied
i
and
so
it
did
to
most
of
us
mr
simple
but
there
was
one
dick
smith
mate
of
a
transport
who
had
come
on
shore
and
he
steps
out
saying
been
looking
at
your
men
handling
that
gun
and
my
opinion
is
that
if
you
gets
a
butt
crams
in
a
carronade
well
woulded
up
and
fill
it
with
old
junk
and
rope
yarns
you
might
parbuckle
it
up
to
the
very
top
so
captain
faulkner
pulls
out
five
doubloons
and
gives
them
to
him
saying
deserve
the
money
for
the
hint
even
if
it
succeed
but
it
did
succeed
mr
simple
and
the
next
day
to
their
surprise
we
opened
fire
on
the
french
beggars
and
soon
brought
their
boasting
down
one
of
the
french
officers
after
he
was
taken
prisoner
axed
me
how
we
had
managed
to
get
the
gun
up
there
but
i
was
going
to
blow
the
gaff
so
i
told
him
as
a
great
secret
that
we
got
it
up
with
a
kite
upon
which
he
opened
all
his
eyes
and
crying
bleu
walked
away
believing
all
i
said
was
true
but
that
a
sail
we
have
opened
with
the
point
mr
simple
it
was
so
and
i
reported
it
to
who
came
up
and
gave
chase
in
half
an
hour
we
were
alongside
of
her
when
she
hoisted
american
colours
and
proved
to
be
a
brigantine
laden
up
to
her
gunwale
which
was
not
above
a
foot
out
of
the
water
her
cargo
consisted
of
what
the
americans
called
that
is
in
english
an
assorted
cargo
up
her
masts
down
to
the
deck
were
hung
up
baskets
containing
apples
potatoes
onions
and
nuts
of
various
kinds
her
deck
was
crowded
with
cattle
sheep
pigs
and
donkeys
below
was
full
of
shingle
lumber
and
a
variety
of
different
articles
too
numerous
to
mention
i
boarded
her
and
asked
the
master
whither
he
was
bound
why
replied
he
i
am
bound
for
a
market
nowise
particular
and
i
guess
you
wo
stop
me
not
if
all
right
replied
i
but
i
must
look
at
your
log
well
i
a
notion
there
no
great
objection
to
that
replied
he
and
he
brought
it
up
on
deck
i
had
no
great
time
to
examine
it
but
i
could
not
help
being
amused
at
the
little
i
did
read
such
as
horse
latitudes
water
very
short
killed
bullock
caught
a
dolphin
and
ate
him
for
dinner
broached
molasses
cask
no
i
letter
a
fine
night
saw
little
round
things
floating
on
the
water
took
up
a
bucket
full
guessed
they
were
pearls
judge
i
guessed
wrong
only
little
portuguese
threw
them
overboard
again
heard
a
scream
guessed
it
was
a
mermaid
looked
out
saw
nothing
witnessed
a
very
strange
rippling
ahead
calculated
it
might
be
the
stood
on
to
see
him
plain
and
nearly
ran
on
barbuda
hauled
off
again
met
a
britisher
treated
having
overhauled
his
log
i
then
begged
to
overhaul
his
men
to
ascertain
if
there
were
any
englishmen
among
his
crew
this
was
not
pleasing
and
he
grumbled
very
much
but
they
were
ordered
aft
one
man
i
was
satisfied
was
an
englishman
and
told
him
so
but
the
man
as
well
as
the
master
persisted
to
the
contrary
nevertheless
i
resolved
to
take
him
on
board
for
to
decide
and
ordered
him
into
the
boat
well
if
you
will
use
force
i
ca
help
it
my
decks
a
clear
as
you
see
or
else
i
tell
you
what
mr
lieutenant
your
vessel
there
will
be
another
i
a
notion
if
you
presses
yankees
and
what
more
the
states
will
take
it
up
as
sure
as
there
snakes
in
virginny
notwithstanding
this
remonstrance
i
took
them
on
board
to
who
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
american
in
the
cabin
when
they
returned
on
deck
he
was
allowed
to
depart
with
his
man
and
we
again
made
sail
i
had
the
first
watch
that
night
and
as
we
ran
along
the
coast
i
perceived
a
vessel
under
the
high
land
in
what
the
sailors
called
the
that
is
almost
becalmed
or
her
sails
flapping
about
in
every
direction
with
the
eddying
winds
we
steered
for
her
and
were
very
soon
in
the
same
situation
not
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
her
the
was
lowered
down
and
i
proceeded
to
board
her
but
as
she
was
large
and
rakish
desired
me
to
be
careful
and
if
there
was
the
least
show
of
resistance
to
return
as
i
pulled
up
to
her
bows
they
hailed
me
in
french
and
desired
me
to
keep
off
or
they
would
fire
this
was
quite
sufficient
and
in
obedience
to
my
orders
i
returned
to
the
brig
and
reported
to
we
lowered
down
all
the
and
towed
round
the
brig
broadside
to
her
and
then
gave
her
half
a
dozen
carronades
of
round
and
grape
hearing
great
noise
and
confusion
on
board
after
we
had
ceased
firing
again
sent
me
to
know
if
they
had
surrendered
they
replied
in
the
affirmative
and
i
boarded
her
she
proved
to
be
the
de
with
three
hundred
and
thirty
slaves
on
board
out
of
five
hundred
embarked
from
the
coast
bound
to
martinique
the
crew
were
very
sickly
and
were
most
of
them
in
their
hammocks
latterly
they
had
been
killing
parrots
to
make
soup
for
them
a
few
that
were
left
of
the
grey
species
spoke
remarkably
well
when
they
left
the
coast
they
had
nearly
one
thousand
parrots
on
board
perceiving
that
i
had
taken
possession
sent
another
boat
to
know
what
the
vessel
was
i
desired
the
surgeon
to
be
sent
on
board
as
some
of
the
men
and
many
of
the
poor
slaves
were
wounded
by
our
shot
of
all
the
miserable
objects
i
know
of
none
to
be
compared
to
the
poor
devils
of
slaves
on
board
of
a
slave
vessel
the
state
of
suffocation
between
decks
the
dreadful
stench
arising
from
their
filth
which
is
hardly
ever
cleared
away
the
sick
lying
without
help
and
looked
upon
by
those
who
are
stronger
with
the
utmost
indifference
men
women
and
children
all
huddled
and
crowded
together
in
a
state
of
nudity
worn
to
skin
and
bone
from
stench
starvation
and
living
in
an
atmosphere
that
none
but
a
negro
could
exist
in
if
all
that
occurs
in
a
were
really
known
i
think
it
would
be
acknowledged
that
to
make
the
piracy
would
be
nothing
more
than
a
just
retribution
and
this
is
certain
that
unless
it
be
made
piracy
it
never
will
be
discontinued
by
daylight
the
vessel
was
ready
and
determined
to
take
her
to
dominica
so
that
the
poor
devils
might
be
immediately
sent
on
shore
we
anchored
with
her
in
a
few
days
in
prince
rupert
bay
where
we
only
had
hours
to
obtain
some
refreshments
and
arrange
about
our
prize
which
i
hardly
need
say
was
of
some
value
during
the
short
time
that
i
was
on
shore
purchasing
some
fowls
and
vegetables
for
and
our
own
mess
i
was
amused
at
witnessing
a
black
serjeant
drilling
some
of
his
regiment
of
free
negroes
and
mulattoes
he
appeared
resolved
to
make
the
best
appearance
that
he
could
for
he
began
by
saying
you
hab
shoe
and
stand
in
front
you
hab

no

you
hab
no

no

back
to
why
you
no
out
sar
you
hangman
i
was
curious
to
count
the
numbers
qualified
for
the
front
rank
there
were
only
two
mulattoes
in
the
second
rank
there
were
also
only
two
no
shoe
and
no
appeared
to
be
the
fashion
as
usual
we
were
surrounded
by
the
negroes
and
although
we
had
been
there
but
a
few
hours
they
had
a
song
composed
for
us
which
they
constantly
repeated
do
you

american
information
not
always
to
be
depended
upon
a
night
attack
we
are
beaten
off
it
proves
a
instead
of
a
after
all
we
save
something
out
of
the
fire
the
next
morning
we
weighed
anchor
and
returned
to
our
station
off
martinique
we
had
run
within
three
miles
of
st
pierre
when
we
discovered
a
vessel
coming
out
under
she
steered
directly
for
us
and
we
made
her
out
to
be
the
american
brigantine
which
we
had
boarded
some
time
before
sent
a
boat
to
bring
the
master
of
her
on
board
well
captain
said
he
so
you
met
with
a
squall
i
calculate
not
replied
he
why
then
what
the
devil
have
you
been
about
why
i
guess
i
sold
all
my
cargo
and
what
more
i
sold
my
masts
sold
your
masts
who
did
you
sell
them
to
to
an
almighty
pretty
french
privateer
lying
in
st
pierre
which
had
lost
her
spars
when
she
was
chased
by
one
of
your
sarpents
and
i
a
notion
they
paid
pretty
handsomely
too
but
how
do
you
mean
to
get
home
again
i
calculate
to
get
into
the
and
then
i
do
very
well
if
i
meet
a
why
then
i
make
a
signal
of
distress
and
some
one
will
tow
me
in
i
guess
well
replied
but
step
down
into
the
cabin
and
take
something
captain
with
particular
pleasure
replied
this
strange
mortal
and
down
they
went
in
about
half
an
hour
they
returned
on
deck
and
the
boat
took
the
american
on
board
soon
afterwards
desired
osbaldistone
and
myself
to
step
down
into
the
cabin
the
chart
of
the
harbour
of
st
pierre
lay
on
the
table
and
said
i
have
had
a
long
conversation
with
the
american
and
he
states
that
the
privateer
is
at
anchor
in
this
spot
pointing
to
a
on
the
chart
if
so
she
is
well
out
and
i
see
no
difficulty
in
capturing
her
you
see
that
she
lays
in
four
fathoms
water
and
so
close
under
the
outer
battery
that
the
guns
could
not
be
pointed
down
upon
the
boats
i
have
also
inquired
if
they
keep
a
good
and
the
american
says
that
they
feel
so
secure
that
they
keep
no
at
all
that
the
captain
and
officers
belonging
to
her
are
on
shore
all
night
drinking
smoking
and
boasting
of
what
they
will
do
now
the
question
is
whether
this
report
be
correct
the
american
has
been
by
us
and
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
him
indeed
he
gave
the
information
voluntarily
as
if
he
wished
to
serve
us
i
allowed
osbaldistone
to
speak
first
he
coincided
with
i
did
not
the
very
circumstance
of
her
requiring
new
masts
made
me
doubt
the
truth
of
his
assertion
as
to
where
she
lay
and
if
one
part
of
his
story
was
false
why
not
the
whole
appeared
struck
with
my
argument
and
it
was
agreed
that
if
the
boats
did
go
away
it
should
be
for
a
reconnoissance
and
that
the
attempt
should
only
be
made
provided
it
was
found
that
the
privateer
laid
in
the
same
spot
pointed
out
by
the
american
master
it
was
however
decided
that
the
reconnoissance
should
take
place
that
very
night
as
allowing
the
privateer
to
be
anchored
on
the
spot
supposed
there
was
every
probability
that
she
would
not
remain
there
but
haul
further
in
to
take
in
her
new
masts
the
news
that
an
expedition
was
at
hand
was
soon
circulated
through
the
ship
and
all
the
men
had
taken
their
cutlasses
from
the
capstern
to
get
them
ready
for
action
the
lighting
boats
crews
without
orders
were
busy
with
their
boats
some
cutting
up
old
blankets
to
muffle
the
oars
other
making
new
grummets
the
ship
company
were
as
busy
as
bees
bustling
and
buzzing
about
the
decks
and
reminding
you
of
the
agitation
which
takes
place
in
a
hive
previous
to
a
swarm
at
last
osbaldistone
came
on
deck
and
ordered
the
boats
crews
to
be
piped
away
and
prepare
for
service
he
was
to
have
the
command
of
the
expedition
in
the
launch
i
had
charge
of
the
first
cutter
of
the
second
and
swinburne
had
the
charge
of
the
at
dusk
the
head
of
the
brig
was
again
turned
towards
st
pierre
and
we
ran
slowly
in
at
ten
we
and
about
eleven
the
boats
were
ordered
to
haul
up
repeating
his
orders
to
mr
osbaldistone
not
to
make
the
attempt
if
the
privateer
were
found
to
be
anchored
close
to
the
town
the
men
were
all
mustered
on
the
to
ascertain
if
they
had
the
distinguishing
mark
on
their
jackets
that
is
square
patches
of
canvas
sewed
on
the
left
arm
so
that
we
might
recognize
friend
from
foe
a
very
necessary
precaution
in
a
night
expedition
and
then
they
were
manned
and
ordered
to
shove
off
the
oars
were
dropped
in
the
water
throwing
out
a
phosphorescent
light
so
common
in
that
climate
and
away
we
went
after
an
hour
pulling
osbaldistone
lay
on
his
oars
in
the
launch
and
we
closed
with
him
we
are
now
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
said
he
and
the
most
perfect
silence
must
be
observed
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
sir
said
swinburne
i
reckon
we
are
more
than
half
way
in
we
passed
the
point
at
least
ten
minutes
ago
and
this
is
the
second
battery
we
are
now
abreast
of
to
this
osbaldistone
did
not
agree
nor
indeed
did
i
think
that
swinburne
was
right
but
he
persisted
in
it
and
pointed
out
to
us
the
lights
in
the
town
which
were
now
all
open
to
us
and
which
would
not
be
the
case
if
we
were
only
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
still
we
were
of
a
different
opinion
and
swinburne
out
of
respect
to
his
officers
said
no
more
we
resumed
our
oars
pulling
with
the
greatest
caution
the
night
was
intensely
dark
and
we
could
distinguish
nothing
after
pulling
ten
minutes
more
we
appeared
to
be
close
to
the
lights
in
the
town
still
we
could
see
no
privateer
or
any
other
vessel
again
we
lay
upon
our
oars
and
held
a
consultation
swinburne
declared
that
if
the
privateer
laid
where
we
supposed
we
had
passed
her
long
ago
but
while
we
were
debating
cried
out
i
see
her
and
he
was
right
she
was
not
more
than
a
cable
length
from
us
without
waiting
for
orders
desired
his
men
to
give
way
and
dashed
alongside
of
the
privateer
before
he
was
on
board
of
her
lights
flew
about
in
every
direction
and
a
dozen
muskets
were
discharged
we
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
follow
him
and
in
a
few
seconds
we
were
all
alongside
of
her
but
she
was
well
prepared
and
on
the
alert
boarding
nettings
were
triced
up
all
round
every
gun
had
been
depressed
as
much
as
possible
and
she
appeared
to
be
full
of
men
a
scene
of
confusion
and
slaughter
now
occurred
which
i
trust
never
again
to
witness
all
our
attempts
to
get
on
board
were
unavailing
if
we
tried
at
a
port
a
dozen
pikes
thrust
us
back
if
we
attempted
the
boarding
nettings
we
were
thrown
down
killed
or
wounded
into
the
boats
from
every
port
and
from
the
decks
of
the
privateer
the
discharge
of
musketry
was
incessant
pistols
were
protruded
and
fired
in
our
faces
while
occasionally
her
carronades
went
off
stunning
us
with
their
deafening
noise
and
rocking
the
boats
in
the
disturbed
water
if
they
had
no
other
effect
for
ten
minutes
our
exertions
never
ceased
at
last
with
half
our
numbers
lying
killed
and
wounded
in
the
bottom
of
the
boats
the
men
worn
out
and
dispirited
at
their
unavailing
attempts
sat
down
most
of
them
on
the
boats
thwarts
loading
their
muskets
and
discharging
them
into
the
ports
osbaldistone
was
among
the
wounded
and
perceiving
that
he
was
not
in
the
launch
of
whose
crew
not
six
remained
i
called
to
swinburne
who
was
alongside
of
me
and
desired
him
to
tell
the
other
boats
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
out
of
the
harbour
this
was
soon
communicated
to
the
survivors
who
would
have
continued
the
unequal
contest
to
the
last
man
if
i
had
not
given
the
order
the
launch
and
second
cutter
shoved
off
also
having
fallen
and
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
privateer
and
had
got
their
oars
to
pass
i
proceeded
to
do
the
same
amidst
the
shouts
and
yells
of
the
frenchmen
who
now
jumped
on
their
gunwale
and
pelted
us
with
their
musketry
cheering
and
mocking
us
stop
sir
cried
swinburne
we
have
a
bit
of
revenge
so
saying
he
the
launch
and
wending
her
bow
to
the
privateer
directed
her
carronade
which
they
had
no
idea
that
we
had
on
board
as
we
had
not
fired
it
to
where
the
frenchmen
were
crowded
the
thickest
stop
one
moment
swinburne
put
another
dose
of
canister
in
we
did
so
and
then
discharged
the
gun
which
had
the
most
murderous
effect
bringing
the
major
part
of
them
down
upon
the
deck
i
feel
convinced
from
the
cries
and
groans
which
followed
that
if
we
had
had
a
few
more
men
we
might
have
returned
and
captured
the
privateer
but
it
was
too
late
the
batteries
were
all
lighted
up
and
although
they
could
not
see
the
boats
fired
in
the
direction
where
they
supposed
us
to
be
for
they
were
aware
from
the
shouting
on
board
the
vessel
that
we
had
been
beaten
off
the
launch
had
but
six
hands
capable
of
taking
an
oar
the
first
cutter
had
but
four
in
my
own
boat
i
had
five
swinburne
had
two
besides
himself
in
the
this
is
a
sorry
business
sir
said
swinburne
now
what
best
to
be
done
my
idea
is
that
we
had
better
put
all
the
wounded
men
into
the
launch
man
the
two
cutters
and
and
tow
her
off
and
mr
simple
instead
of
keeping
on
this
side
as
they
will
expect
in
the
batteries
let
us
keep
close
upon
the
near
side
and
their
shot
will
pass
over
us
this
advice
was
too
good
not
to
be
followed
it
was
now
two
and
we
had
a
long
pull
before
us
and
no
time
to
lose
we
lifted
the
dead
bodies
and
the
wounded
men
out
of
the
two
cutters
and
into
the
launch
i
had
no
time
for
examination
but
i
perceived
that
was
quite
dead
and
also
a
youngster
of
the
name
of
pepper
who
must
have
smuggled
himself
into
the
boats
i
did
however
look
for
osbaldistone
and
found
him
in
the
stern
sheets
of
the
launch
he
had
received
a
deep
wound
in
the
breast
apparently
with
a
pike
he
was
sensible
and
asked
me
for
a
little
water
which
i
procured
from
the
breaker
which
was
in
the
launch
and
gave
it
to
him
at
the
word
water
and
hearing
it
poured
out
from
the
breaker
many
of
the
wounded
men
faintly
called
out
for
some
having
no
time
to
spare
i
left
two
men
in
the
launch
one
to
steer
and
the
other
to
give
them
water
and
then
taking
her
in
tow
pulled
directly
in
for
the
batteries
as
advised
by
swinburne
who
now
sat
alongside
of
me
as
soon
as
we
were
well
i
pulled
out
of
the
harbour
with
feelings
not
by
any
means
enviable
swinburne
said
to
me
in
a
low
voice
this
will
be
a
hard
blow
for
the
captain
mr
simple
i
always
been
told
that
a
young
captain
losing
his
men
without
bringing
any
dollars
to
his
admiral
is
not
very
well
received
i
am
more
sorry
for
him
than
i
can
well
express
swinburne
replied
i
but
what
is
that
a
vessel
under
weigh
swinburne
stood
up
in
the
stern
of
the
cutter
and
looked
for
a
few
seconds
yes
a
large
ship
standing
in
under
royals
she
must
be
a
frenchman
now
our
time
sir
so
long
as
we
do
go
out
all
will
be
well
oars
all
of
you
shall
we
cast
off
the
launch
sir
yes
replied
i
and
now
my
lads
let
us
only
have
the
vessel
and
we
shall
do
she
is
a
merchantman
that
clear
not
that
i
was
sure
of
it
swinburne
i
think
it
will
be
better
to
let
her
pass
us
they
will
all
be
looking
out
of
the
other
side
for
they
must
have
seen
the
firing
well
thought
of
sir
replied
swinburne
we
laid
on
our
oars
and
let
her
pass
us
which
she
did
creeping
in
at
the
rate
of
two
miles
an
hour
we
then
pulled
for
her
quarter
in
the
three
boats
leaving
the
launch
behind
us
and
boarded
as
we
premised
the
crew
were
on
deck
and
all
on
the
other
side
of
the
vessel
so
anxiously
looking
at
the
batteries
which
were
still
firing
occasional
random
shot
that
they
did
not
perceive
us
until
we
were
close
to
them
and
then
they
had
no
time
to
seize
their
arms
there
were
several
ladies
on
board
some
of
the
people
protected
them
others
ran
below
in
two
minutes
we
had
possession
of
her
and
had
put
her
head
the
other
way
to
our
surprise
we
found
that
she
mounted
fourteen
guns
one
hatch
we
left
open
for
the
ladies
some
of
whom
had
fainted
to
be
taken
down
below
the
others
were
fastened
down
by
swinburne
as
soon
as
we
had
the
deck
to
ourselves
we
manned
one
of
the
cutters
and
sent
it
for
the
launch
and
as
soon
as
she
was
made
fast
alongside
we
had
time
to
look
about
us
the
breeze
freshened
and
in
half
an
hour
we
were
out
of
of
all
the
batteries
i
then
had
the
wounded
men
taken
out
of
the
launch
and
swinburne
and
the
other
men
bound
up
their
wounds
and
made
them
as
comfortable
as
they
could

the

a

we
had
had
possession
of
the
vessel
about
an
hour
when
the
man
who
was
sentry
over
the
hatchway
told
me
that
one
or
the
prisoners
wished
to
speak
with
the
english
commanding
officer
and
asked
leave
to
come
on
deck
i
gave
permission
and
a
gentleman
came
up
stating
that
he
was
a
passenger
that
the
ship
was
a
letter
of
marque
from
bordeaux
that
there
were
seven
lady
passengers
on
board
who
had
come
out
to
join
their
husbands
and
families
and
that
he
trusted
i
would
have
no
objection
to
put
them
on
shore
as
women
could
hardly
be
considered
as
objects
of
warfare
as
i
knew
that
would
have
done
so
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
both
women
and
prisoners
if
he
could
i
replied
most
certainly
that
i
would
that
they
might
not
have
so
far
to
pull
on
shore
and
that
i
would
permit
the
ladies
and
other
passengers
to
go
on
shore
i
begged
that
they
would
be
as
quick
as
possible
in
getting
their
packages
ready
and
that
i
would
give
them
two
of
the
boats
belonging
to
the
ship
with
a
sufficient
number
of
french
seamen
belonging
to
her
to
man
the
boats
the
frenchman
was
very
grateful
thanked
me
in
the
name
of
the
ladies
and
went
down
below
to
impart
the
intelligence
i
then
lowered
down
the
boats
from
the
quarters
and
waited
for
them
to
come
up
it
was
daylight
before
they
were
ready
but
that
i
did
not
care
about
i
saw
the
brig
in
the
offing
about
seven
miles
off
and
i
was
well
clear
of
the
batteries
at
last
they
made
their
appearance
one
by
one
coming
up
the
ladder
escorted
by
french
gentlemen
they
had
to
wait
while
the
packages
and
bundles
were
put
into
the
boats
the
first
sight
which
struck
them
with
horror
was
the
many
dead
and
wounded
englishmen
lying
on
the
decks
expressing
their
commiseration
i
told
them
that
we
had
attempted
to
take
the
privateer
and
had
been
repulsed
and
that
it
was
coming
out
of
the
harbour
that
i
had
fallen
in
with
their
ship
and
captured
it
all
the
ladies
had
severally
thanked
me
for
my
kindness
in
giving
them
their
liberty
except
one
whose
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
wounded
men
when
the
french
gentleman
went
up
to
her
and
reminded
her
that
she
had
not
expressed
her
thanks
to
the
commanding
officer
she
turned
round
to
me
i
started
back
i
certainly
had
seen
that
face
before
i
could
not
be
mistaken
yet
she
had
now
grown
up
into
a
beautiful
young
woman
celeste
said
i
trembling
are
you
not
celeste
yes
replied
she
looking
earnestly
at
me
as
if
she
would
discover
who
i
was
but
which
it
was
not
very
easy
to
do
begrimed
as
my
face
was
with
dust
and
gunpowder
have
you
forgotten
peter
simple
oh
no
no
never
forgot
you
cried
celeste
bursting
into
tears
and
holding
out
her
hands
this
scene
occasioned
no
small
astonishment
to
the
parties
on
deck
who
could
not
comprehend
it
she
smiled
through
her
tears
as
i
told
her
how
happy
i
was
to
have
the
means
of
being
of
service
to
her
and
where
is
the
colonel
said
i
there
replied
she
pointing
to
the
island
he
is
now
general
and
commands
the
force
in
the
garrison
and
where
is
mr
interrogated
celeste
there
replied
i
he
commands
that
of
which
i
am
the
second
lieutenant
a
rapid
exchange
of
inquiries
took
place
and
the
boats
were
stopped
while
we
were
in
conversation
swinburne
reported
that
the
brig
was
standing
in
for
us
and
i
felt
that
in
justice
to
the
wounded
i
could
no
longer
delay
still
i
found
time
to
press
her
hand
to
thank
her
for
the
purse
she
had
given
me
when
i
was
on
the
stilts
and
to
tell
her
that
i
had
never
forgotten
her
and
never
would
with
many
remembrances
to
her
father
i
was
handing
her
into
the
boat
when
she
said
i
do
know
whether
i
am
right
to
ask
it
but
you
could
do
me
such
a
favour
what
is
it
celeste
you
have
allowed
more
than
of
the
men
to
pull
us
on
shore
some
must
remain
and
they
are
so
miserable
indeed
it
is
hardly
yet
decided
which
of
them
are
to
go
could
you
let
them
all
go
that
i
will
for
your
sake
celeste
as
soon
as
your
two
boats
have
shoved
off
i
will
lower
down
the
boat
astern
and
send
the
rest
after
you
but
i
must
make
sail
now
god
bless
you
the
boats
then
shoved
off
the
passengers
waving
their
handkerchiefs
to
us
and
i
made
sail
for
the
brig
as
soon
as
the
was
alongside
the
rest
of
the
crew
were
called
up
and
put
into
her
and
followed
their
companions
i
felt
that
would
not
be
angry
with
me
for
letting
them
all
go
and
especially
when
i
told
him
who
begged
for
them
the
vessel
name
was
the
mounting
fourteen
guns
and
men
with
eleven
passengers
she
was
chiefly
laden
with
silks
and
wine
and
was
a
very
valuable
prize
celeste
had
time
to
tell
me
that
her
father
had
been
four
years
in
martinique
and
had
left
her
at
home
for
her
education
and
that
she
was
then
coming
out
to
join
him
the
other
ladies
were
all
wives
or
daughters
of
officers
of
the
french
garrison
on
the
island
and
the
gentlemen
passengers
were
some
of
them
french
officers
but
as
this
was
told
me
in
secrecy
of
course
i
was
not
bound
to
know
it
as
they
were
not
in
uniform
as
soon
as
we
had
closed
with
the
brig
i
hastened
on
board
to
and
as
soon
as
a
fresh
supply
of
hands
to
man
the
boats
and
the
surgeon
had
been
despatched
on
board
of
the
prize
to
superintend
the
removal
of
the
wounded
i
went
down
with
him
into
the
cabin
and
narrated
what
had
occurred
well
said
all
well
that
ends
well
but
this
is
not
the
luckiest
hit
in
the
world
your
taking
the
ship
has
saved
me
peter
and
i
must
make
as
flourishing
a
despatch
as
i
can
by
the
powers
but
very
lucky
that
she
has
fourteen
guns
it
sounds
grand
i
must
muddle
it
all
up
together
so
that
the
admiral
must
think
we
intended
to
cut
them
both
out
and
so
we
did
sure
enough
if
we
had
known
she
had
been
there
but
i
am
most
anxious
to
hear
the
surgeon
report
and
whether
poor
osbaldistone
will
do
well
peter
oblige
me
by
going
on
board
and
put
two
marines
sentry
over
the
hatchway
so
that
no
one
goes
down
and
pulls
the
traps
about
for
i
send
on
shore
everything
belonging
to
the
passengers
for
colonel
sake
the
surgeon
report
was
made
six
killed
and
sixteen
wounded
the
killed
were
and
pepper
midshipmen
two
seamen
and
two
marines
the
first
lieutenant
osbaldistone
was
severely
wounded
in
three
places
but
likely
to
do
well
five
other
men
were
dangerously
wounded
the
other
ten
would
in
all
probability
return
to
their
duty
in
less
than
a
month
as
soon
as
the
wounded
were
on
board
returned
with
me
to
the
prize
and
we
went
down
into
the
cabin
all
the
passengers
effects
were
collected
the
trunks
which
had
been
left
open
were
nailed
down
and
wrote
a
handsome
letter
to
general
containing
a
list
of
the
packages
sent
on
shore
we
sent
the
launch
with
a
flag
of
truce
to
the
nearest
battery
after
some
demur
it
was
accepted
and
effects
landed
we
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
made
all
sail
to
join
the
admiral
at
barbadoes
the
next
morning
we
buried
those
who
had
fallen
was
a
fine
young
man
brave
as
a
lion
but
very
hot
in
his
temper
he
would
have
made
a
good
officer
had
he
been
spared
poor
little
pepper
was
also
much
regretted
he
was
but
twelve
years
old
he
had
bribed
the
bowman
of
the
second
cutter
to
allow
him
to
conceal
himself
under
the
of
the
boat
his
day
allowance
of
spirits
had
purchased
him
this
object
of
his
ambition
which
ended
so
fatally
but
as
soon
as
the
bodies
had
disappeared
under
the
wave
and
the
service
was
over
we
all
felt
happier
there
is
something
very
unpleasant
particularly
to
sailors
in
having
a
corpse
on
board
we
now
sailed
merrily
along
the
prize
keeping
company
with
us
and
before
we
reached
barbadoes
most
of
the
men
were
convalescent
osbaldistone
wounds
were
however
very
severe
and
he
was
recommended
to
return
home
which
he
did
and
obtained
his
promotion
as
soon
as
he
arrived
he
was
a
pleasant
messmate
and
i
was
sorry
to
lose
him
although
the
lieutenant
appointed
in
his
room
being
junior
to
me
i
was
promoted
to
be
first
lieutenant
of
the
brig
soon
after
osbaldistone
went
home
his
brother
broke
his
neck
when
hunting
and
osbaldistone
came
into
the
property
he
then
quitted
the
service
we
found
the
admiral
at
barbadoes
who
received
and
his
despatch
very
well
had
taken
two
good
prizes
and
that
was
sufficient
to
cover
a
multitude
of
sins
even
if
he
had
committed
any
but
the
despatch
was
admirably
written
and
the
admiral
in
his
letter
to
the
admiralty
commented
upon
captain
successful
and
daring
attack
whereas
if
the
truth
had
been
known
it
was
swinburne
advice
of
pulling
up
the
weather
shore
which
was
the
occasion
of
our
capturing
the
but
it
is
very
hard
to
come
at
the
real
truth
of
these
sort
of
things
as
i
found
out
during
the
time
that
i
was
in
his
majesty
service
chapter
xlvi
tells
his
crew
that
one
englishman
is
as
good
as
three
frenchmen
on
salt
water
they
prove
it
we
fall
in
with
an
old
acquaintance
although
she
could
not
be
considered
as
a
friend
our
next
cruise
was
on
the
coast
of
guinea
and
gulf
of
mexico
where
we
were
running
up
and
down
for
three
months
without
falling
in
with
anything
but
west
indiamen
bound
to
demerara
berbice
and
surinam
and
occasionally
chasing
a
privateer
but
in
the
light
winds
they
were
too
fast
for
us
still
we
were
useful
in
protecting
the
trade
and
had
a
letter
of
thanks
from
the
merchants
and
a
handsome
piece
of
plate
upon
his
quitting
the
station
we
had
made
sail
for
barbadoes
two
days
and
were
within
sight
of
the
island
of
trinidad
when
we
perceived
six
sail
on
the
we
soon
made
them
out
to
be
three
large
ships
and
three
schooners
and
immediately
guessed
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
correct
that
they
were
three
privateers
with
west
india
ships
which
they
had
captured
we
made
all
sail
and
at
first
the
three
privateers
did
the
same
but
afterwards
having
made
out
our
force
and
not
liking
to
abandon
their
prizes
they
resolved
to
fight
the
west
indiamen
hauled
to
the
wind
on
the
other
tack
and
the
three
privateers
shortened
sail
and
awaited
our
coming
we
beat
to
quarters
and
when
everything
was
ready
and
we
were
within
a
mile
of
the
enemy
who
had
now
thrown
out
the
flag
ordered
all
the
men
aft
on
the
and
addressed
them
now
my
men
you
see
that
there
are
three
privateers
and
you
also
see
that
there
are
three
west
indiamen
which
they
have
captured
as
for
the
privateers
it
just
a
fair
match
for
you
one
englishman
can
always
beat
three
frenchmen
we
must
lick
the
privateers
for
honour
and
glory
and
we
must
the
ships
for
profit
because
you
all
want
some
money
when
you
get
on
shore
again
so
you
just
things
to
do
and
then
we
pipe
to
dinner
this
harangue
suited
the
sailors
very
well
and
they
returned
to
their
guns
now
peter
said
just
call
away
the
from
the
guns
for
i
mean
to
fight
these
fellows
under
sail
and
them
if
i
can
tell
mr
webster
i
want
to
speak
with
him
mr
webster
was
the
second
lieutenant
a
very
steady
quiet
young
man
and
a
good
officer
mr
webster
said
remember
that
all
the
foremost
guns
must
be
very
much
depressed
i
prefer
that
the
shot
should
strike
the
water
before
it
reaches
them
rather
than
it
should
go
over
them
see
that
your
screws
are
run
up
at
once
and
i
will
take
care
that
no
broadside
is
thrown
away
starboard
swinburne
starboard
it
is
sir
steady
so
that
right
for
the
stern
of
the
leeward
vessel
we
were
within
two
cable
lengths
of
the
privateers
who
still
remained
within
half
a
cable
length
of
each
other
they
were
very
large
schooners
full
of
men
with
their
boarding
netting
triced
up
and
showing
a
very
good
set
of
teeth
as
it
afterwards
proved
one
mounted
sixteen
and
the
other
two
fourteen
guns
now
my
lads
over
to
the
lee
guns
and
fire
as
they
bear
when
we
round
to
hands
by
the
lee
and
stretch
along
the
weather
braces
abaft
tend
the
port
hard
swinburne
port
it
is
sir
replied
swinburne
and
the
brig
rounded
up
on
the
wind
shooting
up
under
the
sterns
of
the
two
weathermost
schooners
and
discharging
the
broadsides
into
them
as
the
guns
bore
be
smart
and
load
my
lads
and
stand
by
the
same
guns
round
in
the
weather
peter
i
do
want
her
to
go
about
stand
by
to
haul
over
the
when
she
pays
off
swinburne
helm
amidships
by
this
time
another
broadside
was
poured
into
the
schooner
who
had
not
yet
returned
our
fire
which
having
foolishly
remained
hove
to
the
wind
they
could
not
do
the
brig
had
now
stern
way
and
then
executed
a
very
skilful
manoeuvre
he
shifted
the
helm
and
made
a
stern
board
so
as
to
back
in
between
the
two
weather
schooners
and
the
one
to
leeward
bracing
round
at
the
same
time
on
the
other
tack
man
both
sides
my
lads
and
give
them
your
broadsides
as
we
pass
the
men
stationed
at
the
starboard
guns
flew
over
and
the
other
side
being
again
loaded
we
exchanged
broadsides
with
the
leeward
and
one
of
the
windward
schooners
the
brig
continuing
her
stern
way
until
we
passed
ahead
of
them
by
the
time
that
we
had
the
brig
had
gathered
headway
and
again
passed
between
the
same
two
schooners
exchanging
broadsides
and
then
passing
astern
of
them
capital
my
lads
capital
said
this
is
what
i
call
good
fighting
and
so
it
was
for
had
given
two
raking
broadsides
and
four
others
receiving
only
two
in
return
for
the
schooners
were
not
ready
for
us
when
we
passed
between
them
the
last
time
the
smoke
had
now
rolled
away
to
leeward
and
we
were
able
to
see
the
effect
of
our
broadsides
the
middle
schooner
had
lost
her
and
appeared
very
much
cut
up
in
the
hull
the
schooner
to
leeward
did
not
appear
to
have
suffered
much
but
they
now
perceived
their
error
and
made
sail
they
had
expected
that
we
should
have
run
in
between
them
and
fought
broadside
to
broadside
by
which
means
the
weathermost
schooner
would
have
taken
a
raking
position
while
the
others
engaged
us
to
windward
and
to
leeward
our
own
damages
were
trifling
two
men
slightly
wounded
and
one
main
shroud
cut
away
we
ran
about
half
a
mile
astern
from
them
then
with
both
broadsides
ready
we
tacked
and
found
that
as
we
expected
we
could
weather
the
whole
of
them
this
we
did
running
the
brig
within
of
the
weather
schooner
engaging
him
broadside
to
broadside
with
the
advantage
that
the
other
two
could
not
fire
a
shot
into
us
without
standing
a
chance
of
striking
their
consort
if
he
made
more
sail
so
did
we
if
he
shortened
so
did
we
so
as
to
keep
our
position
with
little
variation
the
schooner
fought
well
but
her
metal
was
not
to
be
compared
with
our
pound
carronades
which
ploughed
up
her
sides
at
so
short
a
distance
driving
two
ports
into
one
at
last
her
foremast
went
by
the
board
and
she
dropped
astern
in
the
meantime
the
other
schooners
had
both
tacked
and
were
coming
up
under
our
stern
to
rake
us
but
the
accident
which
happened
to
the
one
we
had
engaged
left
us
at
liberty
we
knew
that
she
could
not
escape
so
we
tacked
and
engaged
the
other
two
nearing
them
as
fast
as
we
could
the
breeze
now
sprang
up
fast
and
put
up
the
helm
and
passed
between
them
giving
them
both
a
raking
broadside
of
grape
and
cannister
which
brought
the
sticks
about
their
ears
this
sickened
them
the
smallest
schooner
which
had
been
the
leewardmost
at
the
commencement
of
the
action
made
all
sail
on
a
wind
we
clapped
on
the
royals
to
follow
her
when
we
perceived
that
the
other
schooner
which
had
been
in
the
middle
and
whose
we
had
shot
away
had
put
her
helm
up
and
was
crowding
all
sail
before
the
wind
then
said
must
not
try
for
too
much
or
we
shall
lose
all
put
her
about
peter
we
must
be
content
with
the
one
that
is
left
us
we
went
about
and
ranged
up
to
the
schooner
which
had
lost
her
foremast
but
she
finding
that
her
consort
had
deserted
her
hauled
down
her
colours
just
as
we
were
about
to
pour
in
our
broadside
our
men
gave
three
cheers
and
it
was
pleasant
to
see
them
all
shaking
hands
with
each
other
congratulating
and
laughing
at
the
successful
result
of
our
action
now
my
lads
be
smart
we
done
enough
for
honour
now
for
profit
peter
take
the
two
cutters
full
of
men
and
go
on
board
of
the
schooner
while
i
get
hold
of
the
three
west
indiamen
rig
something
jury
forward
and
follow
me
in
a
minute
the
cutters
were
down
and
full
of
men
i
took
possession
of
the
schooner
while
the
brig
again
tacked
and
crowding
all
sail
stood
after
the
captured
vessels
the
schooner
which
was
the
largest
of
the
three
was
called
the
d
mounting
sixteen
guns
and
had
men
on
board
the
remainder
being
away
in
the
prizes
the
captain
was
wounded
very
badly
and
one
officer
killed
out
of
her
ship
company
she
had
but
eight
killed
and
five
wounded
they
informed
me
that
they
had
sailed
three
months
ago
from
st
pierre
martinique
and
had
fallen
in
with
the
other
two
privateers
and
cruised
in
company
having
taken
nine
west
indiamen
since
they
had
come
out
pray
said
i
to
the
officer
who
gave
the
information
were
you
ever
attacked
by
boats
when
you
laid
at
st
pierre
he
replied
yes
and
that
they
had
beaten
them
off
did
you
purchase
these
masts
of
an
american
he
replied
in
the
affirmative
so
that
we
had
captured
the
very
vessel
in
attempting
to
cut
out
which
we
had
lost
so
many
men
we
were
all
very
glad
of
this
and
swinburne
said
well
hang
me
if
i
did
think
that
i
had
seen
that
before
there
it
was
that
i
wrenched
a
pike
out
of
one
of
the
rascal
hands
who
tried
to
stab
me
and
into
that
i
fired
at
least
a
dozen
muskets
well
d
d
glad
we
got
hold
of
the
beggar
at
last
we
secured
the
prisoners
below
and
commenced
putting
the
schooner
in
order
in
half
an
hour
we
had
completed
our
knotting
and
splicing
and
having
two
of
the
carpenters
with
us
in
an
hour
we
had
got
up
a
small
jury
mast
forward
sufficient
for
the
present
we
lowered
the
mainsail
put
on
her
and
stood
after
the
brig
which
was
now
close
to
the
prizes
but
they
separated
and
it
was
not
till
dark
that
she
had
possession
of
two
the
third
was
then
hull
down
on
the
other
tack
with
the
brig
in
chase
we
followed
the
brig
as
did
the
two
vessels
and
even
with
our
jury
up
we
found
that
we
could
sail
as
fast
as
they
the
next
morning
we
saw
the
brig
and
about
three
miles
with
the
three
vessels
in
her
possession
we
closed
and
i
went
on
board
webster
was
put
in
charge
of
the
privateer
and
after
for
that
day
to
send
our
and
men
on
board
to
remove
the
prisoners
we
got
up
a
proper
and
all
made
sail
together
for
barbadoes
on
my
return
on
board
i
found
that
we
had
but
one
man
and
one
boy
killed
and
six
wounded
which
i
was
not
aware
of
i
forgot
to
say
that
the
names
of
the
other
two
privateers
were
and
in
a
fortnight
we
arrived
with
all
our
prizes
safe
in
carlisle
bay
where
we
found
the
admiral
who
had
anchored
but
two
days
before
i
hardly
need
say
that
was
well
received
and
gained
a
great
deal
of
credit
for
the
action
i
found
several
letters
from
my
sister
the
contents
of
which
gave
me
much
pain
my
father
had
been
some
months
in
ireland
and
returned
without
gaining
any
information
my
sister
said
that
he
was
very
unhappy
paid
no
attention
to
his
clerical
duties
and
would
sit
for
days
without
speaking
that
he
was
very
much
altered
in
his
appearance
and
had
grown
thin
and
in
short
said
she
my
dear
peter
i
am
afraid
that
he
is
fretting
himself
to
death
of
course
i
am
very
lonely
and
melancholy
i
can
not
help
reflecting
upon
what
will
be
my
situation
if
any
accident
should
happen
to
my
father
accept
my
uncle
protection
i
will
not
yet
how
am
i
to
live
for
my
father
has
saved
nothing
i
have
been
very
busy
lately
trying
to
qualify
myself
for
a
governess
and
practise
the
harp
and
piano
for
several
hours
every
day
i
shall
be
very
very
glad
when
you
come
home
again
i
showed
the
letters
to
who
read
them
with
much
attention
i
perceived
the
colour
mount
into
his
cheeks
when
he
read
those
parts
of
her
letters
in
which
she
mentioned
his
name
and
expressed
her
gratitude
for
his
kindness
towards
me
never
mind
peter
said
returning
me
the
letters
to
whom
is
it
that
i
am
indebted
for
my
promotion
and
this
brig
but
to
you
and
for
all
the
which
i
have
made
and
which
by
the
head
of
st
patrick
comes
to
a
very
dacent
sum
but
to
you
make
yourself
quite
easy
about
your
dear
little
sister
we
club
your
and
mine
together
and
she
shall
marry
a
duke
if
there
is
one
in
england
deserving
her
and
it
the
french
that
shall
furnish
her
dowry
as
sure
as
the
carries
a
tail
chapter
xlvii
i
am
sent
away
after
prizes
and
meet
with
a
hurricane
am
driven
on
shore
with
the
loss
of
more
than
half
my
men
where
is
the
in
three
weeks
we
were
again
ready
for
sea
and
the
admiral
ordered
us
to
our
old
station
off
martinique
we
had
cruised
about
a
fortnight
off
st
pierre
and
as
i
walked
the
deck
at
night
often
did
i
look
at
the
lights
in
the
town
and
wonder
whether
any
of
them
were
in
the
presence
of
celeste
when
one
evening
being
about
six
miles
off
shore
we
observed
two
vessels
rounding
negro
point
close
it
was
quite
calm
and
the
boats
were
towing
ahead
it
will
be
dark
in
peter
said
and
i
think
we
might
get
them
before
they
anchor
or
if
they
do
anchor
it
will
be
well
outside
what
do
you
think
i
agreed
with
him
for
in
fact
i
always
seemed
to
be
happier
when
the
brig
was
close
as
i
felt
as
if
i
was
nearer
to
celeste
and
the
further
we
were
off
the
more
melancholy
i
became
continually
thinking
of
her
and
the
sight
of
her
after
so
many
years
separation
had
changed
my
youthful
attachment
into
strong
affection
i
may
say
that
i
was
deeply
in
love
the
very
idea
of
going
into
the
harbour
therefore
gave
me
pleasure
and
there
was
no
mad
or
foolish
thing
that
i
would
not
have
done
only
to
gaze
upon
the
walls
which
contained
the
constant
object
of
my
thoughts
these
were
wild
and
visionary
notions
and
with
little
chance
of
ever
arriving
to
any
successful
issue
but
at
one
or
we
are
fond
of
building
castles
and
very
apt
to
fall
in
love
without
considering
our
prospect
of
success
i
replied
that
i
thought
it
very
possible
and
wished
he
would
permit
me
to
make
the
attempt
as
if
i
found
there
was
much
risk
i
would
return
i
know
that
i
can
trust
you
peter
replied
and
it
a
great
pleasure
to
know
that
you
have
an
officer
you
can
trust
but
have
i
brought
you
up
myself
and
made
a
man
of
you
as
i
promised
i
would
when
you
were
a
little
spalpeen
with
a
sniffling
nose
and
legs
in
the
shape
of
two
carrots
so
hoist
out
the
launch
and
get
the
boats
ready
the
sooner
the
better
what
a
hot
day
this
has
been
not
a
on
the
water
and
the
sky
all
of
a
mist
only
look
at
the
sun
how
he
goes
down
puffed
out
to
three
times
his
size
as
if
he
were
in
a
terrible
passion
i
suspect
we
shall
have
the
land
breeze
off
strong
in
half
an
hour
i
shoved
off
with
the
boats
it
was
now
quite
dark
and
i
pulled
towards
the
harbour
of
st
pierre
the
heat
was
excessive
and
unaccountable
not
the
slightest
breath
of
wind
moved
in
the
heavens
or
below
no
clouds
to
be
seen
and
the
stars
were
obscured
by
a
sort
of
mist
there
appeared
a
total
stagnation
in
the
elements
the
men
in
the
boats
pulled
off
their
jackets
for
after
a
few
moments
pulling
they
could
bear
them
no
longer
as
we
pulled
in
the
atmosphere
became
more
opaque
and
the
darkness
more
intense
we
supposed
ourselves
to
be
at
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
but
could
see
nothing
not
three
yards
ahead
of
the
boat
swinburne
who
always
went
with
me
was
steering
the
boat
and
i
observed
to
him
the
unusual
appearance
of
the
night
i
been
watching
it
sir
replied
swinburne
and
i
tell
you
mr
simple
that
if
we
only
know
how
to
find
the
brig
that
i
would
advise
you
to
get
on
board
of
her
immediately
she
want
all
her
hands
this
night
or
i
much
mistaken
why
do
you
say
so
replied
i
because
i
think
nay
i
may
say
that
i
sartin
we
have
a
hurricane
afore
morning
it
not
the
first
time
i
cruised
in
these
latitudes
i
recollect
in
but
i
interrupted
him
swinburne
i
believe
that
you
are
right
at
all
events
i
turn
back
perhaps
we
may
reach
the
brig
before
it
comes
on
she
carries
a
light
and
we
can
find
her
out
i
then
turned
the
boat
round
and
steered
as
near
as
i
could
guess
for
where
the
brig
was
lying
but
we
had
not
pulled
out
more
than
two
minutes
before
a
low
moaning
was
heard
in
the
atmosphere
now
here
now
there
and
we
appeared
to
be
pulling
through
solid
darkness
if
i
may
use
the
expression
swinburne
looked
around
him
and
pointed
out
on
the
starboard
bow
it
mr
simple
sure
enough
many
the
living
being
that
will
not
rise
on
its
legs
see
sir
i
looked
and
dark
as
it
was
it
appeared
as
if
a
sort
of
black
wall
was
sweeping
along
the
water
right
towards
us
the
moaning
gradually
increased
to
a
stunning
roar
and
then
at
once
it
broke
upon
us
with
a
noise
to
which
no
thunder
can
bear
a
comparison
the
oars
were
caught
by
the
wind
with
such
force
that
the
men
were
dashed
forward
under
the
thwarts
many
of
them
severely
hurt
fortunately
we
pulled
with
tholes
and
pins
or
the
gunwale
and
planks
of
the
boat
would
have
been
wrenched
off
and
we
should
have
foundered
the
wind
soon
caught
the
boat
on
her
broadside
and
had
there
been
the
least
sea
would
have
inevitably
thrown
her
over
but
swinburne
put
the
helm
down
and
she
fell
off
before
the
hurricane
darting
through
the
boiling
water
at
the
rate
of
ten
miles
an
hour
all
hands
were
aghast
they
had
recovered
their
seats
but
were
obliged
to
relinquish
them
and
sit
down
at
the
bottom
holding
on
by
the
thwarts
the
terrific
roaring
of
the
hurricane
prevented
any
communication
except
by
gesture
the
other
boats
had
disappeared
lighter
than
ours
they
had
flown
away
faster
before
the
sweeping
element
but
we
had
not
been
a
minute
before
the
wind
before
the
sea
rose
in
a
most
unaccountable
manner
it
appeared
to
be
by
magic
of
all
the
horrors
that
ever
i
witnessed
nothing
could
be
compared
to
the
scene
of
this
night
we
could
see
nothing
and
heard
only
the
wind
before
which
we
were
darting
like
an
arrow
to
where
we
knew
not
unless
it
was
to
certain
death
swinburne
steered
the
boat
every
now
and
then
looking
back
as
the
waves
increased
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
in
a
heavy
swell
that
at
one
minute
bore
us
all
aloft
and
at
the
next
almost
sheltered
us
from
the
hurricane
and
now
the
atmosphere
was
charged
with
showers
of
spray
the
wind
cutting
off
the
summits
of
the
waves
as
if
with
a
knife
and
carrying
them
along
with
it
as
it
were
in
its
arms
the
boat
was
filling
with
water
and
appeared
to
settle
down
fast
the
men
baled
with
their
hats
in
silence
when
a
large
wave
culminated
over
the
stern
filling
us
up
to
our
thwarts
the
next
moment
we
all
received
a
shock
so
violent
that
we
were
jerked
from
our
seats
swinburne
was
thrown
over
my
head
every
timber
of
the
boat
separated
at
once
and
she
appeared
to
crumble
from
under
us
leaving
us
floating
on
the
raging
waters
we
all
struck
out
for
our
lives
but
with
little
hope
of
preserving
them
but
the
next
wave
dashed
us
on
the
rocks
against
which
the
boat
had
already
been
hurled
that
wave
gave
life
to
some
and
death
to
others
me
in
heaven
mercy
it
preserved
i
was
thrown
so
high
up
that
i
merely
scraped
against
the
top
of
the
rock
breaking
two
of
my
ribs
swinburne
and
eight
more
escaped
with
me
but
not
unhurt
two
had
their
legs
broken
three
had
broken
arms
and
the
others
were
more
or
less
contused
swinburne
miraculously
received
no
injury
we
had
been
eighteen
in
the
boat
of
which
ten
escaped
the
others
were
hurled
up
at
our
feet
and
the
next
morning
we
found
them
dreadfully
mangled
one
or
two
had
their
skulls
literally
shattered
to
pieces
against
the
rocks
i
felt
that
i
was
saved
and
was
grateful
but
still
the
hurricane
howled
still
the
waves
were
washing
over
us
i
crawled
further
up
upon
the
beach
and
found
swinburne
sitting
down
with
his
eyes
directed
seaward
he
knew
me
took
my
hand
squeezed
it
and
then
held
it
in
his
for
some
moments
we
remained
in
this
position
when
the
waves
which
every
moment
increased
in
volume
washed
up
to
us
and
obliged
us
to
crawl
further
up
i
then
looked
around
me
the
hurricane
continued
in
its
fury
but
the
atmosphere
was
not
so
dark
i
could
trace
for
some
distance
the
line
of
the
harbour
from
the
ridge
of
foam
upon
the
shore
and
for
the
first
time
i
thought
of
and
the
brig
i
put
my
mouth
close
to
swinburne
ear
and
cried
out
swinburne
shook
his
head
and
looked
up
again
at
the
offing
i
thought
whether
there
was
any
chance
of
the
brig
escape
she
was
certainly
six
if
not
seven
miles
off
and
the
hurricane
was
not
direct
on
the
shore
she
might
have
a
drift
of
ten
miles
perhaps
but
what
was
that
against
such
tremendous
power
i
prayed
for
those
on
board
of
the
brig
and
returned
thanks
for
my
own
preservation
i
was
or
soon
should
be
a
prisoner
no
doubt
but
what
was
that
i
thought
of
celeste
and
felt
almost
happy
in
about
three
hours
the
force
of
the
wind
subsided
it
still
blew
a
heavy
gale
but
the
sky
cleared
up
the
stars
again
twinkled
in
the
heavens
and
we
could
see
to
a
considerable
distance
it
breaking
now
sir
said
swinburne
at
last
satisfied
with
the
injury
it
has
done
and
that
no
little
this
is
worse
than
now
i
give
all
my
pay
and
if
it
were
only
daylight
and
i
could
know
the
fate
of
the
poor
what
do
you
think
swinburne
all
depends
upon
whether
they
were
taken
unprepared
sir
captain
is
as
good
a
seaman
as
ever
trod
a
plank
but
he
never
has
been
in
a
hurricane
and
may
not
have
known
the
signs
and
warnings
which
god
in
his
mercy
has
vouchsafed
to
us
your
flush
vessels
fill
easily
but
we
must
hope
for
the
best
most
anxiously
did
we
look
out
for
the
day
which
appeared
to
us
as
if
it
never
would
break
at
last
the
dawn
appeared
and
we
stretched
our
eyes
to
every
part
of
the
offing
as
it
was
lighted
up
but
we
could
not
see
the
brig
the
sun
rose
and
all
was
bright
and
clear
but
we
looked
not
around
us
our
eyes
were
directed
to
where
we
had
left
the
brig
the
sea
was
still
running
high
but
the
wind
abated
fast
thank
god
ejaculated
swinburne
when
he
had
directed
his
eyes
along
the
coast
she
is
above
water
at
all
events
and
looking
in
the
direction
where
he
pointed
i
perceived
the
brig
within
two
miles
of
the
shore
dismantled
and
tossing
in
the
waves
i
see
her
replied
i
catching
my
breath
with
joy
but
still
i
think
she
must
go
on
shore
all
depends
upon
whether
she
can
get
a
little
bit
of
sail
up
to
weather
the
point
replied
swinburne
and
depend
upon
it
captain
knows
that
as
well
as
we
do
we
were
now
joined
by
the
other
men
who
were
saved
we
all
shook
hands
they
pointed
out
to
me
the
bodies
of
our
shipmates
who
had
perished
i
directed
them
to
haul
them
further
up
and
put
them
all
together
and
continued
with
swinburne
to
watch
the
brig
in
about
half
an
hour
we
perceived
a
triangle
raised
and
in
ten
minutes
afterwards
a
abaft
a
was
hoisted
and
set
then
the
shears
were
seen
forward
and
in
as
short
a
time
another
and
a
were
expanded
to
the
wind
that
all
he
can
do
now
mr
simple
observed
swinburne
he
must
trust
to
them
and
providence
they
are
not
more
than
a
mile
from
the
beach
it
will
be
touch
and
go
anxiously
did
we
watch
for
more
than
half
an
hour
the
other
men
returned
to
us
and
joined
in
our
speculations
at
one
time
we
thought
it
impossible
at
another
we
were
certain
that
she
would
weather
the
point
at
last
as
she
neared
us
she
warped
ahead
my
anxiety
became
almost
insupportable
i
stood
first
on
one
leg
and
then
on
the
other
breathless
with
suspense
she
appeared
to
be
on
the
point
actually
touching
the
rocks
god
she
struck
said

chapter
xlviii
the
devastation
of
the
hurricane
peter
makes
friends
at
destroying
or
saving
nothing
like
british
seamen
peter
meets
with
general
much
to
his
satisfaction
has
another
meeting
still
more
so
a
great
deal
of
pressing
of
hands
and
all
that
as
pope
says
now
that
the
brig
was
safe
we
thought
of
ourselves
my
first
attention
was
directed
to
the
dead
bodies
and
as
i
looked
at
their
mangled
limbs
i
felt
grateful
to
heaven
that
i
had
been
so
miraculously
spared
we
then
cast
our
eyes
along
the
beach
to
see
if
we
could
trace
any
remnants
of
the
other
boats
but
in
vain
we
were
about
three
miles
from
the
town
which
we
could
perceive
had
received
considerable
damage
and
the
beach
below
it
was
strewed
with
wrecks
and
fragments
i
told
the
men
that
we
might
as
well
walk
into
the
town
and
deliver
ourselves
up
as
prisoners
to
which
they
agreed
and
we
set
forward
promising
to
send
for
the
poor
fellows
who
were
too
much
hurt
to
accompany
us
as
soon
as
we
climbed
up
the
rocks
and
gained
the
inland
what
a
sight
presented
itself
to
us
trees
torn
up
by
the
roots
in
every
direction
cattle
lying
dead
here
and
there
the
remains
of
a
house
of
which
the
other
parts
had
been
swept
away
for
miles
everything
not
built
of
solid
masonry
had
disappeared
we
passed
what
had
been
a
range
of
negro
huts
but
they
were
levelled
to
the
ground
the
negroes
were
busily
searching
for
their
property
among
the
ruins
while
the
women
held
their
infants
in
their
arms
and
the
other
children
by
their
sides
here
and
there
was
the
mother
wailing
over
the
dead
body
of
some
poor
little
thing
which
had
been
crushed
to
death
they
took
no
notice
of
us
about
half
a
mile
further
on
to
our
great
delight
we
fell
in
with
the
crews
of
the
other
boats
who
were
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
road
they
had
all
escaped
unhurt
their
boats
being
so
much
more
buoyant
than
ours
had
been
thrown
up
high
and
dry
they
joined
us
and
we
proceeded
on
our
way
on
our
road
we
fell
in
with
a
cart
blown
over
under
the
wheel
of
which
was
the
leg
of
the
negro
who
conducted
it
we
released
the
poor
fellow
his
leg
was
fractured
we
laid
him
by
the
side
of
the
road
in
the
shade
and
continued
our
march
our
whole
route
was
one
scene
of
desolation
and
distress
but
when
we
arrived
at
the
town
we
found
that
there
it
was
indeed
accumulated
there
was
not
one
house
in
three
standing
entire
the
beach
was
covered
with
remnants
of
bodies
and
fragments
of
vessels
whose
masts
lay
forced
several
feet
into
the
sand
and
broken
into
four
or
five
pieces
parties
of
soldiers
were
busy
taking
away
the
bodies
and
removing
what
few
valuables
had
been
saved
we
turned
up
into
the
town
for
no
one
accosted
us
or
even
noticed
us
and
here
the
scene
was
even
more
dreadful
in
some
streets
they
were
digging
out
those
who
were
still
alive
and
whose
cries
were
heard
among
the
ruins
in
others
they
were
carrying
away
the
dead
bodies
the
lamentations
of
the
relatives
the
howling
of
the
negroes
the
cries
of
the
wounded
the
cursing
and
swearing
of
the
french
soldiers
and
the
orders
delivered
continually
by
officers
on
horseback
with
all
the
confusion
arising
from
crowds
of
spectators
mingling
their
voices
together
formed
a
scene
as
dreadful
as
it
was
novel
after
surveying
it
for
a
few
minutes
i
went
up
to
an
officer
on
horseback
and
told
him
in
french
that
i
wished
to
surrender
myself
as
a
prisoner
we
have
no
time
to
take
prisoners
now
replied
he
hundreds
are
buried
in
the
ruins
and
we
must
try
to
save
them
we
must
now
attend
to
the
claims
of
humanity
will
you
allow
my
men
to
assist
you
sir
replied
i
they
are
active
and
strong
fellows
sir
said
he
taking
off
his
hat
i
thank
you
in
the
name
of
my
unfortunate
countrymen
show
us
then
where
we
may
be
most
useful
he
turned
and
pointed
to
a
house
higher
up
the
offices
of
which
were
blown
down
there
are
living
beings
under
those
ruins
come
my
lads
said
i
and
sore
as
they
were
my
men
hastened
with
alacrity
to
perform
their
task
i
could
not
help
them
myself
my
side
was
so
painful
but
i
stood
by
giving
them
directions
in
half
an
hour
we
had
cleared
away
so
as
to
arrive
at
a
poor
negro
girl
whose
cries
we
had
distinctly
heard
we
released
her
and
laid
her
down
in
the
street
but
she
fainted
her
left
hand
was
dreadfully
shattered
i
was
giving
what
assistance
i
could
and
the
men
were
busy
clearing
away
throwing
on
one
side
the
beams
and
rafters
when
an
officer
on
horseback
rode
up
he
stood
and
asked
me
who
we
were
i
told
him
that
we
belonged
to
the
brig
and
had
been
wrecked
and
that
we
were
giving
what
assistance
we
could
until
they
were
at
leisure
to
send
us
to
prison
you
english
are
fine
brave
fellows
replied
he
and
he
rode
on
another
unfortunate
object
had
been
recovered
by
our
men
an
old
negro
but
he
was
too
much
mangled
to
live
we
brought
him
out
and
were
laying
him
beside
the
negro
girl
when
several
officers
on
horseback
rode
down
the
street
the
one
who
was
foremost
in
a
uniform
i
immediately
recognized
as
my
former
friend
then
colonel
they
all
stopped
and
looked
at
us
i
told
who
we
were
general
took
off
his
hat
to
the
sailors
and
thanked
them
he
did
not
recognize
me
and
he
was
passing
on
when
i
said
to
him
in
english
general
you
have
forgotten
me
but
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
my
god
said
he
is
it
you
my
dear
fellow
and
he
sprang
from
his
horse
and
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
no
wonder
that
i
did
not
know
you
you
are
a
very
different
person
from
little
peter
simple
who
dressed
up
as
a
girl
and
danced
on
stilts
but
i
have
to
thank
you
and
so
has
celeste
for
your
kindness
to
her
i
will
not
ask
you
to
leave
your
work
of
charity
and
kindness
but
when
you
have
done
what
you
can
come
up
to
my
house
anyone
will
show
it
to
you
and
if
you
do
not
find
me
you
will
find
celeste
as
you
must
be
aware
can
not
leave
this
melancholy
employment
god
bless
you
he
then
rode
off
followed
by
his
staff
come
my
lads
said
i
depend
upon
it
we
shall
not
be
very
cruelly
treated
let
us
work
hard
and
do
all
the
good
we
can
and
the
frenchmen
wo
forget
it
we
had
cleared
that
house
and
went
back
to
where
the
other
people
were
working
under
the
orders
of
the
officer
on
horseback
i
went
up
to
him
and
told
him
we
had
saved
two
and
if
he
had
no
objection
would
assist
his
party
he
thankfully
accepted
our
services
and
now
my
lads
said
swinburne
let
us
forget
all
our
bruises
and
show
these
french
fellows
how
to
work
and
they
did
so
they
tossed
away
the
beams
and
rafters
right
and
left
with
a
quickness
and
dexterity
which
quite
astonished
the
officer
and
other
inhabitants
who
were
looking
on
and
in
half
an
hour
had
done
more
work
than
could
have
been
possibly
expected
several
lives
were
saved
and
the
french
expressed
their
admiration
at
our
sailors
conduct
and
brought
them
something
to
drink
which
they
stood
much
in
need
of
poor
fellows
after
that
they
worked
double
tides
as
we
say
and
certainly
were
the
means
of
saving
many
lives
which
otherwise
would
have
been
sacrificed
the
disasters
occasioned
by
this
hurricane
were
very
great
owing
to
its
having
taken
place
at
night
when
the
chief
of
the
inhabitants
were
in
bed
and
asleep
i
was
told
that
most
of
the
wood
houses
were
down
five
minutes
after
the
hurricane
burst
upon
them
about
noon
there
was
no
more
work
for
us
to
do
and
i
was
not
sorry
that
it
was
over
my
side
was
very
painful
and
the
burning
heat
of
the
sun
made
me
feel
giddy
and
sick
at
the
stomach
i
inquired
of
a
respectable
looking
old
frenchman
which
was
the
general
house
he
directed
me
to
it
and
i
proceeded
there
followed
by
my
men
when
i
arrived
i
found
the
orderly
leading
away
the
horse
of
general
who
had
just
returned
i
desired
a
sergeant
who
was
in
attendance
at
the
door
to
acquaint
the
general
that
i
was
below
he
returned
and
desired
me
to
follow
him
i
was
conducted
into
a
large
room
where
i
found
him
in
company
with
several
officers
he
again
greeted
me
warmly
and
introduced
me
to
the
company
as
the
officer
who
had
permitted
the
ladies
who
had
been
taken
prisoners
to
come
on
shore
i
have
to
thank
you
then
for
my
wife
said
an
officer
coming
up
and
offering
his
hand
another
came
up
and
told
me
that
i
had
also
released
his
we
then
entered
into
a
conversation
in
which
i
stated
the
occasion
of
my
having
been
wrecked
and
all
the
particulars
also
that
i
had
seen
the
brig
in
the
morning
dismasted
but
that
she
had
weathered
the
point
and
was
safe
that
brig
of
yours
i
must
pay
you
the
compliment
to
say
has
been
very
troublesome
and
my
namesake
keeps
the
batteries
more
upon
the
alert
than
ever
i
could
have
done
said
general
i
do
believe
there
is
a
negro
five
years
old
upon
the
island
who
does
not
know
your
brig
we
then
talked
over
the
attack
of
the
privateer
in
which
we
were
beaten
off
ah
replied
the
you
made
a
mess
of
that
he
has
been
gone
these
four
months
captain
carnot
swears
that
he
fight
you
if
he
falls
in
with
you
he
has
kept
his
word
replied
i
and
then
i
narrated
our
action
with
the
three
french
privateers
and
the
capture
of
the
vessel
which
surprised
and
i
think
annoyed
them
very
much
well
my
friend
said
general
you
must
stay
with
me
while
you
are
on
the
island
if
you
want
anything
let
me
know
i
am
afraid
that
i
want
a
surgeon
replied
i
for
my
side
is
so
painful
that
i
can
scarcely
breathe
are
you
hurt
then
said
general
with
an
anxious
look
not
dangerously
i
believe
said
i
but
rather
painfully
let
me
see
said
an
officer
who
stepped
forward
i
am
surgeon
to
the
forces
here
and
perhaps
you
will
trust
yourself
in
my
hands
take
off
your
coat
i
did
so
with
difficulty
you
have
two
ribs
broken
said
he
and
a
very
severe
contusion
you
must
go
to
bed
or
lie
on
a
sofa
for
a
few
days
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
will
come
and
dress
you
and
promise
you
to
make
you
all
well
in
ten
days
in
return
for
your
having
given
me
my
daughter
who
was
on
board
of
the
with
the
other
ladies
the
officers
now
made
their
bows
and
left
me
alone
with
general
recollect
said
he
that
i
tell
it
you
once
for
all
that
my
purse
and
everything
is
at
your
command
if
you
do
not
accept
them
freely
i
shall
think
you
do
not
love
us
it
is
not
the
first
time
peter
and
you
repaid
me
honourably
however
of
course
i
was
no
party
to
that
affair
it
was
celeste
doing
continued
he
laughing
of
course
i
could
not
imagine
that
it
was
you
who
was
dressed
up
as
a
woman
and
so
impudently
danced
through
france
on
stilts
but
i
must
hear
all
your
adventures
celeste
is
most
anxious
to
see
you
will
you
go
now
or
wait
till
after
the
surgeon
comes
oh
now
if
you
please
general
may
i
first
beg
that
some
care
may
be
taken
of
my
poor
men
they
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
are
very
much
bruised
and
have
worked
hard
and
that
a
cart
may
be
sent
for
those
who
lie
maimed
on
the
beach
i
should
have
thought
of
them
before
replied
he
and
i
will
also
order
the
same
party
to
bury
the
other
poor
fellows
who
are
lying
on
the
beach
come
now
will
take
you
to
celeste
chapter
xlix
broken

makes
something
very
like
a
declaration
of

peter
simple
actually
makes
a
declaration
of

rash
proceedings
on
all
sides
i
followed
the
general
into
a
handsomely
furnished
apartment
where
i
found
celeste
waiting
to
receive
me
she
ran
to
me
as
soon
as
i
entered
and
with
what
pleasure
did
i
take
her
hand
and
look
on
her
beautiful
expressive
countenance
i
could
not
say
a
word
neither
did
celeste
for
a
minute
i
held
her
hand
in
mine
looking
at
her
the
general
stood
by
regarding
us
alternately
he
then
turned
round
and
walked
to
the
window
i
lifted
the
hand
to
my
lips
and
then
released
it
it
appears
to
be
a
dream
almost
said
celeste
i
could
not
make
any
reply
but
continued
to
gaze
upon
her
she
had
grown
up
into
such
a
beautiful
creature
her
figure
was
perfect
and
the
expression
of
her
countenance
was
so
varied
so
full
of
intellect
and
feeling
it
was
angelic
her
eyes
suffused
with
tears
beamed
so
softly
so
kindly
on
me
i
could
have
fallen
down
and
worshipped
her
come
said
general
come
my
dear
friend
now
that
you
have
seen
celeste
the
surgeon
must
see
you
the
surgeon
cried
celeste
with
alarm
yes
my
love
it
is
of
no
consequence
only
a
couple
of
ribs
broken
i
followed
general
out
of
the
room
and
as
i
came
to
the
door
i
turned
round
to
look
at
celeste
she
had
retreated
to
the
sofa
and
her
handkerchief
was
up
to
her
eyes
the
surgeon
was
waiting
for
me
he
bandaged
me
and
applied
some
cooling
lotion
to
my
side
which
made
me
feel
quite
comfortable
i
must
now
leave
you
said
general
you
had
better
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
and
then
if
i
am
not
back
you
know
your
way
to
celeste
i
lay
down
as
he
requested
but
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
clatter
of
the
horse
hoofs
as
he
rode
off
i
left
the
room
and
hurried
to
the
celeste
was
there
and
hastened
to
inquire
if
i
was
much
hurt
i
replied
in
the
negative
and
told
her
that
i
had
come
down
to
prove
it
to
her
and
we
then
sat
down
on
the
sofa
together
i
have
the
misfortune
never
to
appear
before
you
celeste
except
in
a
very
unprepossessing
state
when
you
first
saw
me
i
was
wounded
at
our
next
meeting
i
was
in
woman
clothes
the
last
time
we
met
i
was
covered
with
dirt
and
gunpowder
and
now
i
return
to
you
wounded
and
in
rags
i
wonder
whether
i
shall
ever
appear
before
you
as
a
gentleman
it
is
not
the
clothes
which
make
the
gentleman
peter
i
am
too
happy
to
see
you
to
think
of
how
you
are
dressed
i
have
never
yet
thanked
you
for
your
kindness
to
us
when
we
last
met
my
father
will
never
forget
it
nor
have
i
thanked
you
celeste
for
your
kindness
in
dropping
the
purse
into
the
hat
when
you
met
me
trying
to
escape
from
france
i
have
never
forgotten
you
and
since
we
met
the
last
time
you
have
hardly
ever
been
out
of
my
thoughts
you
do
know
how
thankful
i
am
to
the
hurricane
for
having
blown
me
into
your
presence
when
we
cruised
in
the
brig
i
have
often
examined
the
town
with
my
glass
trying
to
fancy
that
i
had
my
eye
upon
the
house
you
were
in
and
have
felt
so
happy
when
we
were
close
in
shore
because
i
knew
that
i
was
nearer
to
you
and
peter
i
have
often
watched
the
brig
and
have
been
so
glad
to
see
it
come
nearer
and
then
so
afraid
that
the
batteries
would
fire
at
you
what
a
pity
it
is
that
my
father
and
you
should
be
opposed
to
each
other
we
might
be
so
happy
and
may
be
yet
celeste
replied
i
we
conversed
for
two
hours
which
appeared
to
be
but
ten
minutes
i
felt
that
i
was
in
love
but
i
do
not
think
that
celeste
had
any
idea
at
the
time
that
she
was
but
i
leave
the
reader
to
judge
from
the
little
conversation
i
have
quoted
whether
she
was
not
or
something
very
much
approaching
to
it
the
next
morning
i
went
out
early
to
look
for
the
brig
and
to
my
great
delight
saw
her
about
six
miles
off
the
harbour
mouth
standing
in
for
the
land
she
had
now
got
up
very
respectable
with
topgallants
for
topsails
and
appeared
to
be
well
under
command
when
she
was
within
three
miles
of
the
harbour
she
lowered
the
the
only
one
she
had
left
and
it
pulled
with
a
flag
of
truce
hoisted
at
the
bows
i
immediately
returned
to
my
room
and
wrote
a
detailed
account
of
what
had
taken
place
ready
to
send
to
when
the
boat
returned
and
i
of
course
requested
him
to
send
me
my
effects
as
i
had
nothing
but
what
i
stood
in
i
had
just
completed
my
letter
when
general
came
in
my
dear
friend
said
he
i
have
just
received
a
flag
of
truce
from
captain
requesting
to
know
the
fate
of
his
boats
crews
and
permission
to
send
in
return
the
clothes
and
effects
of
the
survivors
i
have
written
down
the
whole
circumstances
for
him
and
made
the
same
request
to
him
replied
i
and
i
handed
him
my
letter
he
read
it
over
and
returned
it
but
my
dear
lad
you
must
think
very
poorly
of
us
frenchmen
if
you
imagine
that
we
intend
to
detain
you
here
as
a
prisoner
in
the
first
place
your
liberation
of
so
many
french
subjects
when
you
captured
the
would
entitle
you
to
a
similar
act
of
kindness
and
in
the
next
place
you
have
not
been
fairly
captured
but
by
a
visitation
of
providence
which
by
the
means
of
the
late
storm
must
destroy
all
national
antipathies
and
promote
that
universal
philanthropy
between
all
men
which
your
brave
fellows
proved
that
they
possess
you
are
therefore
free
to
depart
with
all
your
men
and
we
shall
still
hold
ourselves
your
debtors
how
is
your
side
oh
very
bad
indeed
replied
i
for
i
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
returning
to
the
brig
so
soon
for
i
had
been
obliged
to
quit
celeste
very
soon
after
dinner
the
day
before
and
go
to
bed
i
had
not
yet
had
much
conversation
with
her
nor
had
i
told
general
how
it
was
that
we
escaped
from
france
i
do
think
i
can
possibly
go
on
board
but
i
feel
very
grateful
to
you
for
your
kindness
well
well
replied
the
general
who
observed
my
feelings
i
do
not
think
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
go
on
board
i
will
send
the
men
and
your
letter
and
i
will
write
to
captain
to
say
that
you
are
in
bed
and
will
not
bear
moving
until
the
day
after
tomorrow
will
that
do
i
thought
it
but
a
very
short
time
but
i
saw
that
the
general
looked
as
if
he
expected
me
to
consent
so
i
did
the
boat
can
come
and
return
again
with
some
of
your
clothes
continued
the
general
and
i
will
tell
captain
that
if
he
comes
off
the
mouth
of
the
harbour
the
day
after
i
will
send
you
on
board
in
one
of
our
boats
he
then
took
my
letter
and
quitted
the
room
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
i
found
myself
quite
well
enough
to
go
to
celeste
who
waited
for
me
and
i
told
her
what
had
passed
that
morning
i
sat
with
her
and
the
general
and
narrated
all
my
adventures
which
amused
the
general
very
much
i
did
not
conceal
the
conduct
of
my
uncle
and
the
hopes
which
i
faintly
entertained
of
being
able
some
day
or
another
to
discover
the
fraud
which
had
been
practised
or
how
very
unfavourable
were
my
future
prospects
if
i
did
not
succeed
at
this
portion
of
my
narrative
the
general
appeared
very
thoughtful
and
grave
when
i
had
finished
it
was
near
dinner
time
and
i
found
that
my
clothes
had
arrived
with
a
letter
from
who
stated
how
miserable
he
had
been
at
the
supposition
of
my
loss
and
his
delight
at
my
escape
he
stated
that
on
going
down
into
the
cabin
after
i
had
shoved
off
he
by
chance
cast
his
eyes
on
the
barometer
and
to
his
surprise
found
that
it
had
fallen
two
inches
which
he
had
been
told
was
the
case
previous
to
a
hurricane
this
combined
with
the
peculiar
state
of
the
atmosphere
had
induced
him
to
make
every
preparation
and
that
they
had
just
completed
their
work
when
it
came
on
the
brig
was
thrown
on
her
beam
ends
and
lay
there
for
half
an
hour
when
they
were
forced
to
cut
away
the
masts
to
right
her
that
they
did
not
weather
the
point
the
next
morning
by
more
than
half
a
cable
length
and
concluded
by
saying
that
the
idea
of
my
death
had
made
him
so
unhappy
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sake
of
the
men
it
was
almost
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
he
had
been
lost
or
not
he
had
written
to
general
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
and
that
if
fifty
vessels
should
pass
the
brig
he
would
not
capture
one
of
them
until
i
was
on
board
again
even
if
he
were
dismissed
the
service
for
neglect
of
duty
he
said
that
the
brig
sailed
almost
as
fast
under
as
she
did
before
and
that
as
soon
as
i
came
on
board
he
should
go
back
to
barbadoes
as
for
your
ribs
being
so
bad
peter
that
all
bother
continued
he
i
know
that
you
are
making
arrangements
for
another
sort
of
as
soon
as
you
can
manage
it
but
you
must
stop
a
little
my
boy
you
shall
be
a
lord
yet
as
i
always
promised
you
that
you
should
it
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
so
when
i
was
alone
with
celeste
i
showed
her
letter
i
had
read
the
part
of
it
relative
to
his
not
intending
to
make
any
capture
while
i
was
on
shore
to
general
who
replied
that
under
such
circumstances
he
thought
he
should
do
right
to
detain
me
a
little
longer
but
said
he
is
a
man
of
honour
and
worthy
of
his
name
when
celeste
came
to
that
part
of
the
letter
in
which
stated
that
i
was
looking
after
another
rib
and
which
i
had
quite
forgotten
she
asked
me
to
explain
it
for
although
she
could
read
and
speak
english
very
well
she
had
not
been
sufficiently
accustomed
to
it
to
comprehend
the
play
upon
words
i
translated
and
then
said
indeed
celeste
i
had
forgotten
that
observation
of
or
i
should
not
have
shown
you
the
letter
but
he
has
stated
the
truth
after
all
your
kindness
to
me
how
can
i
help
being
in
love
with
you
and
need
i
add
that
i
should
consider
it
the
greatest
blessing
which
heaven
could
grant
me
if
you
could
feel
so
much
regard
for
me
as
one
day
to
become
my
wife
do
be
angry
with
me
for
telling
you
the
truth
continued
i
for
celeste
coloured
up
as
i
spoke
to
her
oh
no
i
am
not
angry
with
you
peter
far
from
it
it
is
very
complimentary
to
me
what
you
have
just
said
i
am
aware
continued
i
that
at
present
i
have
little
to
offer
you
indeed
nothing
i
am
not
even
such
a
match
as
your
father
might
approve
of
but
you
know
my
whole
history
and
what
my
desires
are
my
dear
father
loves
me
peter
and
he
loves
you
too
very
much
he
always
did
from
the
hour
he
saw
you
he
was
so
pleased
with
your
candour
and
honesty
of
character
he
has
often
told
me
so
and
very
often
talked
of
you
well
celeste
tell
me
may
i
when
far
away
be
permitted
to
think
of
you
and
indulge
a
hope
that
some
day
we
may
meet
never
to
part
again
and
i
took
celeste
by
the
hand
and
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
i
do
know
what
to
say
replied
she
i
will
speak
to
my
father
or
perhaps
you
will
but
i
will
never
marry
anybody
else
if
i
can
help
it
i
drew
her
close
to
me
and
kissed
her
celeste
burst
into
tears
and
laid
her
head
upon
my
shoulder
when
general
came
i
did
not
attempt
to
move
nor
did
celeste
general
said
i
you
may
think
me
to
blame
but
i
have
not
been
able
to
conceal
what
i
feel
for
celeste
you
may
think
that
i
am
imprudent
and
that
i
am
wrong
in
thus
divulging
what
i
ought
to
have
concealed
until
i
was
in
a
situation
to
warrant
my
aspiring
to
your
hand
but
the
short
time
allowed
me
to
be
in
her
company
the
fear
of
losing
her
and
my
devoted
attachment
will
i
trust
plead
my
excuse
the
general
took
one
or
two
turns
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
replied
what
says
celeste
celeste
will
never
do
anything
to
make
her
father
unhappy
replied
she
going
up
to
him
and
hiding
her
face
in
his
breast
with
her
arm
round
his
neck
the
general
kissed
his
daughter
and
then
said
i
will
be
frank
with
you
mr
simple
i
do
not
know
any
man
whom
i
would
prefer
to
you
as
a
but
there
are
many
considerations
which
young
people
are
very
apt
to
forget
i
do
not
interfere
in
your
attachment
which
appears
to
be
mutual
but
at
the
same
time
i
will
have
no
promise
and
no
engagement
you
may
never
meet
again
however
celeste
is
very
young
and
i
shall
not
put
any
constraint
upon
her
and
at
the
same
time
you
are
equally
free
if
time
and
circumstances
should
alter
your
present
feelings
i
can
ask
no
more
my
dear
sir
replied
i
taking
the
general
by
the
hand
it
is
candid
more
than
i
had
any
reason
to
expect
i
shall
now
leave
you
with
a
contented
mind
and
the
hopes
of
one
day
claiming
celeste
shall
spur
me
to
exertion
now
if
you
please
we
will
drop
the
subject
said
the
general
celeste
my
dear
we
have
a
large
party
to
dinner
as
you
know
you
had
better
retire
to
your
room
and
get
ready
i
have
asked
all
the
ladies
that
you
liberated
peter
and
all
their
husbands
and
fathers
so
you
will
have
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
how
many
people
you
made
happy
by
your
gallantry
now
that
celeste
has
left
the
room
peter
i
must
beg
that
as
a
man
of
honour
you
do
not
exact
from
her
any
more
promises
or
induce
her
to
tie
herself
down
to
you
by
oaths
her
attachment
to
you
has
grown
up
with
her
unaccountably
and
she
is
already
too
fond
of
you
for
her
peace
of
mind
should
accident
or
circumstances
part
you
for
ever
let
us
hope
for
the
best
and
depend
upon
it
that
it
shall
be
no
trifling
obstacle
which
will
hinder
me
from
seeing
you
one
day
united
i
thanked
the
general
with
tears
he
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
as
i
gave
my
promise
and
we
separated
how
happy
did
i
feel
when
i
went
into
my
room
and
sat
down
to
compose
my
mind
and
think
over
what
had
happened
true
at
one
moment
the
thought
of
my
dependent
situation
threw
a
damp
over
my
joy
but
in
the
next
i
was
building
castles
inventing
a
discovery
of
my
uncle
plot
fancying
myself
in
possession
of
the
title
and
property
and
laying
it
at
the
feet
of
my
dear
celeste
hope
sustained
my
spirits
and
i
felt
satisfied
for
the
present
with
the
consideration
that
celeste
returned
my
love
i
decked
myself
carefully
and
went
down
where
i
found
all
the
company
assembled
we
had
a
very
pleasant
happy
party
and
the
ladies
entreated
general
to
detain
me
as
a
prisoner
very
kind
of
them
and
i
felt
very
much
disposed
to
join
in
their
request
chapter
l
peter
simple
first
takes
a
command
then
three
west
indiamen
and
twenty
prisoners
one
good
turn
deserves
another
the
prisoners
endeavour
to
take
him
but
are
themselves
taken
in
the
next
day
i
was
very
unhappy
the
brig
was
in
the
offing
waiting
for
me
to
come
on
hoard
i
pointed
her
out
to
celeste
as
we
were
at
the
window
and
her
eyes
met
mine
an
hour
conversation
could
not
have
said
more
general
showed
that
he
had
perfect
confidence
in
me
for
he
left
us
together
celeste
said
i
i
have
promised
your
father
i
know
what
has
passed
interrupted
she
he
told
me
everything
how
kind
he
is
but
i
did
not
say
that
i
would
not
bind
myself
celeste
no
but
my
father
made
me
promise
that
you
should
not
that
if
you
attempted
i
was
immediately
to
prevent
you
and
so
i
shall
then
you
shall
keep
your
word
celeste
imagine
everything
that
can
be
said
in
this
and
i
kissed
her
do
think
me
forward
peter
but
i
wish
you
to
go
away
happy
said
celeste
and
therefore
in
return
imagine
all
i
could
say
in
this
and
she
returned
my
salute
after
this
we
had
a
conversation
of
two
hours
but
what
lovers
say
is
very
silly
except
to
themselves
and
the
reader
need
not
be
troubled
with
it
general
came
in
and
told
me
the
boat
was
ready
i
rose
up
i
was
satisfied
with
what
had
passed
and
with
a
firm
voice
i
said
celeste
god
bless
you
and
followed
the
general
who
with
some
of
his
officers
walked
down
with
me
to
the
beach
i
thanked
the
general
who
embraced
me
paid
my
adieus
to
the
officers
and
stepped
into
the
boat
in
half
an
hour
i
was
on
board
of
the
brig
and
in
arms
we
put
the
helm
up
and
in
a
short
time
the
town
of
st
pierre
was
shut
out
from
my
longing
sight
and
we
were
on
our
way
to
barbadoes
that
day
was
passed
in
the
cabin
with
giving
him
a
minute
detail
of
all
that
had
passed
when
we
anchored
once
more
in
carlisle
bay
we
found
that
the
hurricane
had
been
much
more
extensive
in
the
windward
islands
than
we
had
imagined
several
men
of
war
were
lying
there
having
lost
one
or
more
of
their
masts
and
there
was
great
difficulty
in
supplying
the
wants
of
so
many
as
we
arrived
the
last
of
course
we
were
last
served
and
there
being
no
boats
left
in
store
there
was
no
chance
of
our
being
ready
for
sea
under
two
or
three
months
the
d
schooner
privateer
was
still
lying
there
but
had
not
been
fitted
out
for
want
of
men
and
the
admiral
proposed
to
that
he
should
man
her
with
a
part
of
his
ship
company
and
send
one
of
his
lieutenants
out
to
cruise
in
her
this
was
gladly
assented
to
by
who
came
on
board
and
asked
me
whether
i
should
like
to
have
her
which
i
agreed
to
as
i
was
quite
tired
of
barbadoes
and
fried
flying
fish
i
selected
two
midshipmen
swinburne
and
twenty
men
and
having
taken
on
board
provisions
and
water
for
three
months
i
received
my
written
instructions
from
and
made
sail
we
soon
discovered
that
the
masts
which
the
american
had
sold
to
the
schooner
were
much
too
large
for
her
she
was
considerably
overmasted
and
we
were
obliged
to
be
very
careful
i
stood
for
trinidad
off
which
island
was
to
be
my
cruising
ground
and
in
three
weeks
had
recaptured
three
west
indiamen
when
i
found
myself
so
short
of
hands
that
i
was
obliged
to
return
to
barbadoes
i
had
put
four
hands
into
the
first
vessel
which
with
the
englishmen
prisoners
were
sufficient
and
three
hands
into
the
two
others
but
i
was
very
much
embarrassed
with
my
prisoners
who
amounted
to
nearly
double
my
ship
company
remaining
on
board
both
the
midshipmen
i
had
sent
away
and
i
consulted
with
swinburne
as
to
what
was
best
to
be
done
why
the
fact
is
mr
simple
captain
ought
to
have
given
us
more
hands
twenty
men
are
little
enough
for
a
vessel
with
a
boom
mainsail
like
the
one
we
have
here
and
now
we
have
only
ten
left
but
i
suppose
he
did
not
expect
us
to
be
so
lucky
and
it
true
enough
that
he
has
plenty
of
work
for
the
ship
company
now
that
he
has
to
turn
everything
in
afresh
as
for
the
prisoners
i
think
we
had
better
run
close
in
and
give
them
two
of
our
boats
to
take
them
on
shore
at
all
events
we
must
be
rid
of
them
and
not
be
obliged
to
have
one
eye
aloft
and
the
other
down
the
hatchway
as
we
must
now
this
advice
corresponded
with
my
own
ideas
and
i
ran
gave
them
the
stern
boat
and
one
of
the
larger
ones
which
held
them
all
and
sent
them
away
leaving
only
one
boat
for
the
schooner
which
we
hoisted
up
in
the
it
fell
a
dead
calm
as
we
sent
away
the
prisoners
we
saw
them
land
and
disappear
over
the
rocks
and
thought
ourselves
well
rid
of
them
as
they
were
in
number
most
of
them
spaniards
and
very
stout
fellows
it
continued
calm
during
the
whole
day
much
to
our
annoyance
as
i
was
very
anxious
to
get
away
as
soon
as
i
could
still
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
beauty
of
the
scenery
the
lofty
mountains
rising
abruptly
from
the
ocean
and
towering
in
the
clouds
reflected
on
the
smooth
water
as
clear
as
in
a
every
colour
every
tint
beautifully
distinct
the
schooner
gradually
drifted
close
and
we
could
perceive
the
rocks
at
the
bottom
many
fathoms
deep
not
a
breath
of
wind
was
to
be
seen
on
the
surface
of
the
water
for
several
miles
round
although
the
horizon
in
the
offing
showed
that
there
was
a
smart
breeze
outside
night
came
on
and
we
still
lay
becalmed
i
gave
my
orders
to
swinburne
who
had
the
first
watch
and
retired
to
my
standing
in
the
cabin
i
was
dreaming
and
i
hardly
need
say
who
was
the
object
of
my
visions
i
thought
i
was
in
eagle
park
sitting
down
with
her
under
one
of
the
large
chestnut
trees
which
formed
the
avenue
when
i
felt
my
shoulder
roughly
pushed
i
started
up
what
is
the
matter
who
that
swinburne
yes
sir
on
with
your
clothes
immediately
as
we
have
work
on
hand
i
expect
and
swinburne
left
the
cabin
and
i
heard
him
calling
the
other
men
who
were
below
i
knew
that
swinburne
would
not
give
a
false
alarm
in
a
minute
i
was
on
deck
and
was
looking
at
the
stern
of
the
schooner
what
is
that
swinburne
said
i
silence
sir
hark
do
you
hear
them
yes
replied
i
the
sound
of
oars
exactly
sir
depend
upon
it
those
spaniards
have
got
more
help
and
are
coming
back
to
take
the
vessel
they
know
we
have
only
ten
hands
on
board
by
this
time
the
men
were
all
on
deck
i
directed
swinburne
to
see
all
the
muskets
loaded
and
ran
down
for
my
own
sword
and
pistols
the
water
was
so
smooth
and
the
silence
so
profound
that
swinburne
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
oars
at
a
considerable
distance
fortunate
it
was
that
i
had
such
a
trusty
follower
another
might
have
slumbered
and
the
schooner
have
been
boarded
and
captured
without
our
being
prepared
when
i
came
on
deck
again
i
spoke
to
the
men
exhorted
them
to
do
their
duty
and
pointed
out
to
them
that
these
villains
would
certainly
murder
us
all
if
we
were
taken
which
i
firmly
believe
would
have
been
the
case
the
men
declared
that
they
would
sell
their
lives
as
dearly
as
they
could
we
had
twenty
muskets
and
the
same
number
of
pistols
all
of
which
were
now
loaded
our
guns
were
also
ready
but
of
no
use
now
that
the
schooner
had
not
the
boats
were
in
sight
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
astern
when
swinburne
said
there
a
flying
along
the
water
mr
simple
if
we
could
only
have
a
little
wind
how
we
would
laugh
at
them
but
afraid
there
no
such
luck
shall
we
let
them
know
that
we
are
ready
let
every
one
of
us
take
two
muskets
said
i
when
the
first
boat
is
under
the
counter
take
good
aim
and
discharge
into
one
of
the
boats
then
seize
the
other
musket
and
discharge
it
at
the
other
boat
after
that
we
must
trust
to
our
cutlasses
and
pistols
for
if
they
come
on
there
will
be
no
time
to
load
again
keep
silence
all
of
you
the
boats
now
came
up
full
of
men
but
as
we
remained
perfectly
quiet
they
pulled
up
gently
hoping
to
surprise
us
fortunately
one
was
a
little
in
advance
of
the
other
upon
which
i
altered
my
directions
and
desired
my
men
to
fire
their
second
musket
into
the
first
boat
as
if
we
could
disable
her
we
were
an
equal
match
for
those
in
the
other
when
the
boat
was
within
six
yards
of
the
schooner
counter
now
said
i
and
all
the
muskets
were
discharged
at
once
and
my
men
cheered
several
of
the
oars
dropped
and
i
was
sure
we
had
done
great
execution
but
they
were
laid
hold
of
by
the
other
men
who
had
not
been
pulling
and
again
the
boat
advanced
to
the
counter
good
aim
my
lads
this
time
cried
swinburne
the
other
boat
will
be
alongside
as
soon
as
you
have
fired
mr
simple
the
schooner
has
headway
and
there
a
strong
breeze
coming
up
again
we
discharged
our
ten
muskets
into
the
boat
but
this
time
we
waited
until
the
had
hooked
on
the
planeshear
with
his
and
our
fire
was
very
effective
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
other
boat
was
not
on
board
of
us
but
a
light
breeze
had
come
up
and
the
schooner
glided
through
the
water
still
she
was
close
under
our
counter
and
would
have
been
aboard
in
a
minute
in
the
meantime
the
spaniards
who
were
in
the
first
boat
were
climbing
up
the
side
and
were
repulsed
by
my
men
with
great
success
the
breeze
freshened
and
swinburne
ran
to
the
helm
i
perceived
the
schooner
was
going
fast
through
the
water
and
the
second
boat
could
hardly
hold
her
course
i
ran
to
where
the
was
fixed
on
the
planeshear
and
unhooked
it
the
boat
fell
astern
leaving
two
spaniards
clinging
to
the
side
who
were
cut
down
and
they
fell
into
the
water
hurrah
all
safe
cried
swinburne
and
now
to
punish
them
the
schooner
was
now
darting
along
at
the
rate
of
five
miles
with
an
increasing
breeze
we
stood
in
for
two
minutes
then
tacked
and
ran
for
the
boats
swinburne
steered
and
i
continued
standing
in
the
bows
surrounded
by
the
rest
of
the
men

my

and
cut

all
who

went
the
schooner
on
to
the
boat
the
men
in
her
in
vain
endeavouring
to
escape
us
for
a
second
or
two
she
appeared
to
right
until
her
further
gunwale
was
borne
down
under
the
water
she
turned
up
and
the
schooner
went
over
her
sending
every
soul
in
her
to
their
account
one
man
clung
on
to
a
rope
and
was
towed
for
a
few
seconds
but
a
cutlass
divided
the
rope
at
the
gunwale
and
with
a
faint
shriek
he
disappeared
the
other
boat
was
close
to
us
and
perceived
what
had
been
done
they
remained
with
their
oars
poised
all
ready
to
pull
so
as
to
evade
the
schooner
we
steered
for
her
and
the
schooner
was
now
running
at
the
rate
of
seven
miles
an
hour
when
close
under
our
bows
by
very
dexterously
pulling
short
round
with
their
starboard
oars
we
only
struck
her
with
our
bow
and
before
she
went
down
many
of
the
spaniards
had
gained
the
deck
or
were
clinging
to
the
side
of
the
vessel
they
fought
with
desperation
but
we
were
too
strong
for
them
it
was
only
those
who
had
gained
the
deck
which
we
had
to
contend
with
the
others
clung
for
a
time
and
unable
to
get
up
the
sides
one
by
one
dropped
into
the
water
and
went
astern
in
a
minute
those
on
deck
were
lying
at
our
feet
and
in
a
minute
more
they
were
tossed
overboard
after
their
companions
not
however
until
one
of
them
struck
me
through
the
calf
of
the
leg
with
his
knife
as
we
were
lifting
him
over
the
gunwale
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
the
spaniards
were
not
justified
in
attempting
to
take
the
schooner
but
still
as
we
had
liberated
them
but
a
few
hours
before
we
felt
that
it
was
unhandsome
and
treacherous
on
their
part
and
therefore
showed
them
no
quarter
there
were
two
of
my
men
wounded
as
well
as
myself
but
not
severely
which
was
fortunate
as
we
had
no
surgeon
on
board
and
only
about
half
a
yard
of
a
diachylum
plaster
in
the
vessel
well
out
of
that
sir
said
swinburne
as
i
limped
aft
by
the
lord
harry
it
might
have
been
a
having
shaped
our
course
for
barbadoes
i
dressed
my
leg
and
went
down
to
sleep
this
time
i
did
not
dream
of
celeste
but
fought
the
spaniards
over
again
thought
i
was
wounded
and
awoke
with
the
pain
of
my
leg

out

with

taken
on

peter
regenerates
by
putting
on
a
new
outward
man
we
made
barbadoes
without
any
further
adventure
and
were
about
ten
miles
off
the
bay
steering
with
a
very
light
breeze
and
i
went
down
into
the
cabin
expecting
to
be
at
anchor
before
breakfast
the
next
morning
it
was
just
daylight
when
i
found
myself
thrown
out
of
my
on
the
deck
on
the
other
side
of
the
cabin
and
heard
the
rushing
of
water
i
sprang
up
i
knew
the
schooner
was
on
her
beam
ends
and
gained
the
deck
i
was
correct
in
my
supposition
she
had
been
upset
by
what
is
called
a
white
squall
and
in
two
minutes
would
be
down
all
the
men
were
up
on
deck
some
dressed
others
like
myself
in
their
shirts
swinburne
was
aft
he
had
an
axe
in
his
hand
cutting
away
the
rigging
of
the
i
saw
what
he
was
about
i
seized
another
and
disengaged
the
and
small
gear
about
the
mast
we
had
no
other
chance
our
boat
was
under
the
water
being
hoisted
up
on
the
side
to
leeward
all
this
however
was
but
the
work
of
two
minutes
and
i
could
not
help
observing
by
what
trifles
lives
are
lost
or
saved
had
the
axe
not
been
fortunately
at
the
capstern
i
should
not
have
been
able
to
cut
the
swinburne
would
not
have
had
time
and
the
would
have
gone
down
with
the
schooner
fortunately
we
had
cleared
it
the
schooner
filled
righted
a
little
and
then
sank
dragging
us
and
the
for
a
few
seconds
down
in
its
vortex
and
then
we
rose
to
the
surface
the
squall
still
continued
but
the
water
was
smooth
it
soon
passed
over
and
again
it
was
nearly
calm
i
counted
the
men
clinging
to
the
boom
and
found
that
they
were
all
there
swinburne
was
next
to
me
he
was
holding
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
quid
of
tobacco
which
he
thrust
into
his
cheek
i
was
on
deck
at
the
time
mr
simple
said
he
or
this
would
have
happened
i
had
just
been
relieved
and
i
told
collins
to
look
out
sharp
for
squalls
i
only
mention
it
that
if
you
are
saved
and
i
am
not
you
may
think
i
was
neglectful
of
my
duty
we
ar
far
from
the
land
but
still
we
are
more
likely
to
fall
in
with
a
shark
than
a
friend
i
thinking
these
indeed
had
been
my
thoughts
but
i
had
concealed
them
but
after
swinburne
had
mentioned
the
shark
i
very
often
looked
along
the
water
for
their
fins
and
down
below
to
see
if
they
were
coming
up
to
tear
us
to
pieces
it
was
a
dreadful
feeling
it
was
not
your
fault
swinburne
i
am
sure
i
ought
to
have
relieved
you
myself
but
i
kept
the
first
watch
and
was
tired
we
must
put
our
trust
in
god
perhaps
we
may
yet
be
spared
it
was
now
almost
calm
and
the
sun
had
mounted
in
the
heavens
the
scorching
rays
were
intolerable
upon
our
heads
for
we
had
not
the
defence
of
hats
i
felt
my
brain
on
fire
and
was
inclined
to
drop
into
the
water
to
screen
myself
from
the
intolerable
heat
as
the
day
advanced
so
did
our
sufferings
increase
it
was
a
dead
calm
the
sun
perpendicular
over
us
actually
burning
that
part
of
our
bodies
which
rose
clear
of
the
water
i
could
have
welcomed
even
a
shark
to
relieve
me
of
my
torment
but
i
thought
of
celeste
and
i
clung
to
life
towards
the
afternoon
i
felt
sick
and
dizzy
my
resolution
failed
me
my
vision
was
imperfect
but
i
was
roused
by
swinburne
who
cried
out
a
boat
by
all
that
gracious
hang
on
a
little
longer
my
men
and
you
are
saved
it
was
a
boat
full
of
negroes
who
had
come
out
to
catch
they
had
perceived
the
spar
on
the
water
and
hastened
to
secure
the
prize
they
dragged
us
all
in
gave
us
water
which
appeared
like
nectar
and
restored
us
to
our
fleeting
senses
they
made
fast
the
boom
and
towed
it
we
had
not
been
ten
minutes
on
our
way
when
swinburne
pointed
to
the
fin
of
a
large
shark
above
the
water
look
there
mr
simple
i
shuddered
and
made
no
answer
but
i
thanked
god
in
my
heart
in
two
hours
we
were
landed
but
were
too
ill
to
walk
we
were
carried
up
to
the
hospital
bled
and
put
into
cots
i
had
a
brain
fever
which
lasted
six
or
seven
days
during
which
never
left
my
bedside
my
head
was
shaved
all
the
skin
came
off
my
face
like
a
mask
as
well
as
off
my
back
and
shoulders
we
were
put
into
baths
of
brandy
and
water
and
in
three
weeks
were
all
recovered
that
was
but
an
unlucky
schooner
from
beginning
to
end
observed
after
i
had
narrated
the
events
of
my
cruise
we
had
a
bad
beginning
with
her
and
we
had
a
bad
ending
she
gone
to
the
bottom
and
the
devil
go
with
her
however
all
well
that
ends
well
and
peter
you
worth
a
dozen
dead
men
yet
but
you
occasion
me
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
anxiety
that
the
truth
of
it
and
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
rear
you
after
all
i
returned
to
my
duty
on
board
of
the
brig
which
was
now
nearly
ready
for
sea
one
morning
came
on
board
and
said
peter
i
a
piece
of
news
for
you
our
gunner
is
appointed
to
the
and
the
admiral
has
given
me
a
gunner
warrant
for
old
swinburne
send
for
him
on
deck
swinburne
was
summoned
and
came
rolling
up
the
hatchway
swinburne
said
you
have
done
your
duty
well
and
you
are
now
gunner
of
the
here
is
your
warrant
and
i
great
pleasure
in
getting
it
for
you
swinburne
turned
the
quid
in
his
cheek
and
then
replied
may
i
be
so
bold
as
to
ax
captain
whether
i
must
wear
one
of
them
long
tog
coats
because
if
so
i
prefer
being
a
a
gunner
may
wear
a
jacket
swinburne
if
he
likes
when
you
go
on
shore
you
may
bend
the
if
you
please
well
sir
then
if
that
the
case
i
take
the
warrant
because
i
know
it
will
please
the
old
woman
so
saying
swinburne
hitched
up
his
trousers
and
went
down
below
i
may
here
observe
that
swinburne
kept
his
round
jacket
until
our
arrival
in
england
when
the
old
woman
his
wife
who
thought
her
dignity
at
stake
soon
made
him
ship
the
and
after
it
was
once
on
swinburne
took
a
fancy
to
it
and
always
wore
it
except
when
he
was
at
sea
the
same
evening
as
i
was
coming
with
from
the
house
where
i
had
dined
we
passed
a
building
lighted
up
what
can
that
be
observed
not
a
dignity
ball
there
is
no
music
our
curiosity
induced
us
to
enter
and
we
found
it
to
be
fitted
up
as
a
temporary
chapel
filled
with
black
and
coloured
people
who
were
ranged
on
the
forms
and
waiting
for
the
preacher
it
is
a
methodist
meeting
said
i
to
never
mind
said
he
let
us
hear
what
is
going
on
in
a
moment
afterwards
the
pulpit
was
filled
not
by
a
white
man
as
we
had
anticipated
but
by
a
tall
negro
he
was
dressed
in
black
and
his
hair
which
it
was
impossible
to
comb
down
straight
was
plaited
into
fifty
little
tails
well
tied
at
the
end
of
them
like
you
sometimes
see
the
mane
of
a
horse
this
produced
a
somewhat
more
clerical
appearance
his
throat
was
open
and
collar
laid
back
the
wristbands
of
his
shirt
very
large
and
white
and
he
flourished
a
white
cambric
handkerchief
what
a
dandy
he
is
whispered
i
thought
it
almost
too
absurd
when
he
said
he
would
take
the
liberty
to
praise
god
in
the
hymn
and
beg
all
the
company
to
join
chorus
he
then
gave
out
the
stanzas
in
the
most
strange
pronunciation
gentle
jesus
god
um
lub
when
the
hymn
was
finished
which
was
sung
by
the
whole
congregation
in
the
most
delightful
discord
everyone
chose
his
own
key
he
gave
an
extempore
prayer
which
was
most
unfortunately
incomprehensible
and
then
commenced
his
discourse
which
was
on
i
shall
omit
the
head
and
front
of
his
offending
which
would
perhaps
hardly
be
gratifying
although
ludicrous
he
reminded
me
of
a
monkey
imitating
a
man
but
what
amused
me
most
was
his
finale
in
which
he
told
his
audience
that
there
could
be
no
faith
without
charity
for
a
little
while
he
descanted
upon
this
generally
and
at
last
became
personal
his
words
were
as
well
as
i
can
recollect
nearly
as
follows
and
now
you
see
my
dear
bredren
how
unpossible
to
go
to
heaven
with
all
the
faith
in
the
world
without
charity
charity

dis

i
let
um
off
and
say
noting
about

because
i
know
plenty
of
plantain
and
banana
pointing
to
one
and
oranges
and
shaddock
pointing
to
another
and
salt
fish
pointing
to
a
fourth
and
and
spruce
beer
pointing
to
a
fifth
and
a
straw
hat
pointing
to
a
sixth
and
eberything
else
come
to
my
house
so
i
say
no
more
it
i
see
you
all
very
sorry
you
only
forget
you
all
ab
charity
and
all
ab
faith
so
now
my
dear
bredren
we
go
down
on
our
knees
and
thank
god
for
all
this
and
more
especially
that
i
save
all
your
souls
from
going
to
the
debil
who
run
about
barbadoes
like
one
roaring
lion
seeking
what
he
may
lay
hold
of
and
cram
into
his
dam
fiery
jaw
that
will
do
peter
said
we
have
the
cream
of
it
i
think
we
left
the
house
and
walked
down
to
the
boat
surely
said
i
this
should
not
be
permitted
he
no
worse
than
his
neighbours
replied
and
perhaps
does
less
harm
i
admire
the
rascal
ingenuity
he
gave
his
flock
what
in
ireland
we
should
call
a
pretty
broad
hint
yes
there
was
no
mistaking
him
but
is
he
a
licensed
preacher
very
little
licence
in
his
preaching
i
take
it
no
i
suppose
he
has
had
a
a
call
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
he
wants
to
fill
his
belly
hunger
is
a
call
of
nature
peter
he
seems
to
want
a
good
many
things
if
we
were
to
judge
by
his
catalogue
what
a
pity
it
is
that
these
poor
people
are
not
better
instructed
that
they
never
will
be
peter
while
there
is
what
may
be
called
free
trade
in
religion
you
speak
like
a
catholic
i
am
one
replied
he
and
here
our
conversation
ended
for
we
were
close
to
the
boat
which
was
waiting
for
us
on
the
beach
the
next
day
a
brig
arrived
from
england
bringing
letters
for
the
squadron
on
the
station
i
had
two
from
my
sister
ellen
which
made
me
very
uncomfortable
she
stated
that
my
father
had
seen
my
uncle
lord
privilege
and
had
had
high
words
with
him
indeed
as
far
as
she
could
ascertain
of
the
facts
my
father
had
struck
my
uncle
and
had
been
turned
out
of
the
house
by
the
servants
that
he
had
returned
in
a
state
of
great
excitement
and
was
very
ill
ever
since
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
talk
in
the
neighbourhood
on
the
subject
people
generally
highly
blaming
my
father
conduct
thinking
that
he
was
deranged
in
his
intellect
a
supposition
very
much
encouraged
by
my
uncle
she
again
expressed
her
hopes
of
my
speedy
return
i
had
now
been
absent
nearly
three
years
and
she
had
been
so
uncomfortable
that
she
felt
as
if
it
had
been
at
least
ten
also
received
a
letter
from
father
which
i
shall
lay
before
the
reader
my
dear
son
long
life
and
all
the
blessings
of
all
the
saints
be
upon
you
now
and
for
evermore
amen
and
may
you
live
to
be
married
and
may
i
dance
at
your
wedding
and
may
you
never
want
children
and
may
they
grow
up
as
handsome
as
their
father
and
their
mother
whoever
she
may
hereafter
be
and
may
you
die
of
a
good
old
age
and
in
the
true
faith
and
be
waked
handsomely
as
your
own
father
was
last
friday
seeing
as
how
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
leave
this
world
for
a
better
it
was
a
very
dacent
my
dear
terence
and
your
father
must
have
been
delighted
to
see
himself
so
well
attinded
no
man
ever
made
a
more
handsome
corpse
considering
how
old
and
thin
and
haggard
he
had
grown
of
late
and
how
gray
his
hair
had
turned
he
held
the
nosegay
between
his
fingers
across
his
breast
as
natural
as
life
and
reminded
us
all
of
the
blessed
saint
pope
gregory
who
was
called
to
glory
some
hundred
years
before
either
you
or
i
was
born
your
mother
quite
comfortable
and
there
she
sits
in
her
ould
chair
rocking
to
and
fro
all
day
long
and
never
speaking
a
word
to
nobody
thinking
about
heaven
i
dare
to
say
which
is
just
what
she
ought
to
do
seeing
that
she
stands
a
very
pretty
chance
of
going
there
in
the
course
of
a
month
or
so
divil
a
word
has
she
ever
said
since
your
father
departure
but
then
she
screamed
and
yelled
enough
to
last
for
seven
years
at
the
least
she
screamed
away
all
her
senses
anyhow
for
she
has
done
nothing
since
but
cough
cough
and
fumble
at
her
a
very
blessed
way
to
pass
the
remainder
of
her
days
seeing
that
i
expect
her
to
drop
every
minute
like
an
sleepy
pear
so
do
think
any
more
about
her
my
son
for
without
you
are
back
in
a
jiffy
her
body
will
be
laid
in
consecrated
ground
and
her
happy
blessed
soul
in
purgatory
amen
amen
and
now
having
disposed
of
your
father
and
your
mother
so
much
to
your
satisfaction
i
just
tell
you
that
ella
mother
died
in
the
convent
at
dieppe
but
whether
she
kept
her
secret
or
not
i
do
not
know
but
this
i
do
know
that
if
she
did
relieve
her
soul
by
confession
she
damned
to
all
eternity
thanks
be
to
god
for
all
his
mercies
amen
ella
flanagan
is
still
alive
and
for
a
nun
is
as
well
as
can
be
expected
i
find
that
she
knows
nothing
at
all
about
the
matter
of
the
exchanging
the
genders
of
the
babbies
only
that
her
mother
was
on
oath
to
father
who
ought
to
be
hanged
drawn
and
quartered
instead
of
those
poor
fellows
whom
the
government
called
rebels
but
who
were
no
more
rebels
than
father
himself
who
uphold
the
pretender
as
they
call
our
true
catholic
king
as
long
as
there
life
in
his
body
or
a
drop
of
whiskey
left
in
ould
ireland
to
drink
his
health
talking
about
father
puts
me
in
mind
that
the
bishop
has
not
yet
decided
our
little
bit
of
a
dispute
saying
that
he
must
take
time
to
think
about
it
now
considering
that
it
just
three
years
since
the
row
took
place
the
old
gentleman
must
be
a
very
slow
thinker
not
to
have
found
out
by
this
time
that
i
was
in
the
right
and
that
father
the
baste
is
not
good
enough
to
be
hanged
your
two
married
sisters
are
steady
and
diligent
young
women
having
each
made
three
children
since
you
last
saw
them
fine
boys
every
mother
son
of
them
with
elegant
spacious
features
and
famous
mouths
for
taking
in
whole
potatoes
by
the
powers
but
the
offsets
of
the
tree
of
the
begin
to
make
a
noise
in
the
land
anyhow
as
you
would
say
if
you
only
heard
them
roaring
for
their
bit
of
suppers
and
now
my
dear
son
terence
the
real
purport
of
this
letter
which
is
just
to
put
to
your
soul
conscience
as
a
dutiful
son
whether
you
ought
not
to
send
me
a
small
matter
of
money
to
save
your
poor
father
soul
from
pain
and
anguish
for
it
no
joke
that
being
in
purgatory
i
can
tell
you
and
you
would
care
how
soon
you
were
tripped
out
of
it
yourself
i
only
wish
you
had
but
your
little
toe
in
it
and
then
you
burn
with
impatience
to
have
it
out
again
but
you
a
dutiful
son
so
i
say
no
more
about
it
a
nod
as
good
as
a
wink
to
a
blind
horse
when
your
mother
goes
which
with
the
blessing
of
god
will
be
in
a
very
little
while
seeing
that
she
has
only
to
follow
her
senses
which
are
gone
already
i
take
upon
myself
to
sell
everything
as
worldly
goods
and
chattels
are
of
no
use
to
dead
people
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
what
with
the
furniture
and
the
two
cows
and
the
pigs
and
the
crops
in
the
ground
there
will
be
enough
to
save
her
soul
from
the
flames
and
bury
her
dacently
into
the
bargain
however
as
you
are
the
seeing
that
the
property
is
all
your
own
i
keep
a
debtor
and
creditor
account
of
the
whole
and
should
there
be
any
over
i
use
it
all
out
in
masses
so
as
to
send
her
up
to
heaven
by
express
and
if
there
not
sufficient
she
must
remain
where
she
is
till
you
come
back
and
make
up
the
deficiency
in
the
meanwhile
i
am
your
loving
father

the

peter
star
no

in

ascendant
was
sorry
for
the
death
of
his
father
but
he
could
not
feel
as
most
people
would
have
done
as
his
father
had
certainly
never
been
a
father
to
him
he
was
sent
to
sea
to
be
got
rid
of
and
ever
since
he
had
been
there
had
been
the
chief
support
of
his
family
his
father
was
very
fond
of
whiskey
and
not
very
fond
of
exertion
he
was
too
proud
of
the
true
milesian
blood
in
his
veins
to
do
anything
to
support
himself
but
not
too
proud
to
live
upon
his
son
gains
for
his
mother
felt
very
much
she
had
always
been
kind
and
affectionate
and
was
very
fond
of
him
sailors
however
are
so
estranged
from
their
families
when
they
have
been
long
in
their
profession
and
so
accustomed
to
vicissitudes
that
no
grief
for
the
loss
of
a
relation
lasts
very
long
and
in
a
week
had
recovered
his
usual
spirits
when
a

us

with
despatches
to
england
forthwith
in
three
days
we
were
reported
ready
received
our
orders
and
at
eight
in
the
evening
made
sail
from
carlisle
bay
well
mr
swinburne
said
i
how
do
you
like
your
new
situation
why
mr
simple
i
like
it
well
enough
and
it
not
disagreeable
to
be
an
officer
and
sit
in
your
own
cabin
but
still
i
feel
that
i
should
get
on
better
if
i
were
in
another
ship
i
been
well
met
with
the
ship
company
so
long
that
i
ca
top
the
officer
over
them
and
we
ca
get
the
duty
done
as
smart
as
i
could
wish
and
then
at
night
i
find
it
very
lonely
stuck
up
in
my
cabin
like
a
parson
clerk
and
nobody
to
talk
to
for
the
other
warrants
are
particular
and
say
that
i
only
acting
and
may
not
be
confirmed
so
they
hold
aloof
i
do
much
like
being
answerable
for
all
that
lot
of
gunpowder
queer
stuff
to
handle
very
true
swinburne
but
still
if
there
were
no
responsibility
we
should
require
no
officers
you
recollect
that
you
are
now
provided
for
life
and
will
have
that
what
made
me
bite
mr
simple
i
thought
of
the
old
woman
and
how
comfortable
it
would
make
her
in
her
old
age
and
so
d
see
i
sacrificed
myself
how
long
have
you
been
married
swinburne
ever
since
christmas
i
was
going
to
be
hooked
carelessly
so
i
nibbled
afore
i
took
the
bait
had
four
years
trial
of
her
first
and
finding
that
she
had
plenty
of
ballast
i
sailed
her
as
my
own
how
do
you
mean
by
plenty
of
ballast
i
do
mean
mr
simple
a
broad
bow
and
square
hulk
you
know
very
well
that
if
a
vessel
has
not
ballast
she
bottom
up
in
no
time
now
what
keeps
a
woman
stiff
under
her
canvas
is
her
modesty
very
true
but
it
a
rare
commodity
on
the
beach
and
why
mr
simple
because
liquor
is
more
valued
many
a
good
man
has
found
it
to
be
his
bane
and
as
for
a
woman
when
once
she
takes
to
it
she
like
a
ship
without
a
rudder
and
goes
right
before
the
wind
to
the
devil
not
that
i
think
a
man
ought
not
to
take
a
or
two
when
he
can
get
them
rum
was
not
given
by
god
almighty
only
to
make
the
niggers
dance
but
to
make
all
our
hearts
glad
neither
do
i
see
why
a
woman
is
to
stand
out
neither
what
good
for
jack
ca
hurt
poll
only
there
is
a
medium
as
they
say
in
all
things
and
is
quite
strong
enough
i
should
think
it
was
replied
i
laughing
but
do
be
letting
me
prevent
you
from
keeping
a
mr
you
hoskins
you
half
a
point
off
the
wind
luff
you
i
think
mr
simple
that
captain
did
pick
out
the
best
man
when
he
made
tom
alsop
a
in
my
place
why
he
is
a
very
steady
good
man
swinburne
yes
so
he
is
but
he
has
natural
defects
which
should
be
overlooked
i
doubt
if
he
can
see
so
far
as
the
head
of
the
mainsail
i
was
not
aware
of
that
no
but
i
was
alsop
wants
to
sarve
out
his
time
for
his
pension
and
when
he
has
sarved
you
see
if
when
the
surgeons
examine
him
they
do
invalid
him
as
blind
as
a
bat
i
should
like
to
have
him
as
gunner
mate
and
that
just
what
he
fit
for
but
mr
simple
i
think
we
shall
have
some
bad
weather
the
moon
looks
greasy
and
the
stars
want
snuffing
you
have
two
reefs
in
the
topsails
afore
morning
there
five
bells
striking
now
i
turn
in
if
i
did
keep
half
the
first
and
half
the
morning
watch
i
should
sleep
all
the
night
i
miss
my
regular
watch
very
much
mr
simple
habit
everything
and
i
do
much
fancy
a
standing
it
so
large
and
i
feel
so
cold
of
my
sides
nothing
like
a
hammock
after
all
mr
simple
our
orders
were
to
proceed
with
all
despatch
and
carried
on
day
and
night
generally
remaining
up
himself
till
one
or
two
in
the
morning
we
had
very
favourable
weather
and
in
a
little
more
than
a
month
we
passed
the
lizard
the
wind
being
fair
we
passed
plymouth
ran
up
channel
and
anchored
at
spithead
after
calling
upon
the
admiral
set
off
for
town
with
his
despatches
and
left
me
in
command
of
the
ship
in
three
days
i
received
a
letter
from
him
informing
me
that
he
had
seen
the
first
lord
who
had
asked
him
a
great
many
questions
concerning
the
station
he
had
quitted
that
he
had
also
complimented
on
his
services
on
that
hint
i
spake
continued
i
ventured
to
insinuate
to
his
lordship
that
i
had
hoped
i
had
earned
my
promotion
and
as
there
is
nothing
like
on
the
i
observed
that
i
had
not
applied
to
lord
privilege
as
i
considered
my
services
would
have
been
sufficient
without
any
application
on
his
part
his
lordship
returned
a
very
gracious
answer
said
that
my
lord
privilege
was
a
great
ally
of
his
and
very
friendly
to
the
government
and
inquired
when
i
was
going
to
see
him
i
replied
that
i
certainly
should
not
pay
my
respects
to
his
lordship
at
present
unless
there
was
occasion
for
it
as
i
must
take
a
more
favourable
opportunity
so
i
hope
that
good
may
come
from
the
great
lord
error
which
of
course
i
shall
not
correct
as
i
feel
i
deserve
my
promotion
and
you
know
peter
if
you
ca
gain
it
by
you
must
by
he
then
concluded
his
letter
but
there
was
a
postscript
as
follows
wish
me
joy
my
dear
peter
i
have
this
moment
received
a
letter
from
the
private
secretary
to
say
that
i
am
and
appointed
to
the
frigate
about
to
set
sail
for
the
east
indies
she
is
all
ready
to
start
and
now
i
must
try
to
get
you
with
me
of
which
i
have
no
doubt
as
although
her
officers
have
been
long
appointed
there
will
be
little
difficulty
of
success
when
i
mention
your
relationship
to
lord
privilege
and
while
they
remain
in
error
as
to
his
taking
an
interest
in
my
behalf
i
rejoiced
at
good
fortune
his
promotion
i
had
considered
certain
as
his
services
had
entitled
him
to
it
but
the
command
of
so
fine
a
frigate
must
have
been
given
upon
the
supposition
that
it
would
be
agreeable
to
my
uncle
who
was
not
only
a
prime
supporter
but
a
very
useful
member
of
the
tory
government
i
could
not
help
laughing
to
myself
at
the
idea
of
obtaining
his
wishes
from
the
influence
of
a
person
who
probably
detested
him
as
much
as
one
man
could
detest
another
and
i
impatiently
waited
for
next
letter
by
which
i
hoped
to
find
myself
appointed
to
the
but
a
sad
took
place
did
not
write
but
came
down
two
days
afterwards
hastened
on
board
the
read
his
commission
and
assumed
the
command
before
even
he
had
seen
me
he
then
sent
his
gig
on
board
of
the
to
desire
me
to
come
to
him
directly
i
did
so
and
we
went
down
into
the
cabin
of
the
frigate
peter
said
he
i
was
obliged
to
hasten
down
and
read
myself
captain
of
this
ship
as
i
am
in
fear
that
things
are
not
going
on
well
i
had
called
to
pay
my
respects
at
the
admiralty
previous
to
joining
and
was
kicking
my
heels
in
the
when
who
should
walk
up
the
passage
as
if
he
were
a
captain
on
his
own
but
your
uncle
lord
privilege
his
eye
met
mine
he
recognised
me
immediately
and
if
it
did
not
flash
fire
it
did
something
very
like
it
he
asked
a
few
questions
of
one
of
the
porters
and
was
giving
his
card
when
my
name
was
called
for
i
passed
him
and
up
i
went
to
the
first
lord
thanked
him
for
the
frigate
and
having
received
a
great
many
compliments
upon
my
exertions
in
the
west
india
station
made
my
bow
and
retired
i
had
intended
to
have
requested
your
appointment
but
i
knew
that
your
name
would
bring
up
lord
privilege
and
moreover
your
uncle
card
was
brought
up
and
laid
upon
the
table
while
i
was
sitting
there
the
first
lord
i
presume
thought
that
his
lordship
was
come
to
thank
him
for
his
kindness
to
me
which
only
made
him
more
civil
i
made
my
bow
and
went
down
when
i
met
the
eye
of
lord
privilege
who
looked
daggers
at
me
as
he
walked
up
stairs
for
of
course
he
was
admitted
immediately
after
my
audience
was
finished
instead
of
waiting
to
hear
the
result
of
the
explanation
i
took
a
and
have
come
down
here
as
fast
as
four
horses
can
bring
me
and
have
read
myself
in
for
peter
i
feel
sure
that
if
not
on
board
my
commission
will
be
cancelled
and
i
know
that
if
once
in
command
as
i
am
now
i
can
call
for
a
to
clear
my
character
if
i
am
superseded
i
know
that
the
admiralty
do
anything
but
still
they
will
be
cautious
in
departing
from
the
rules
of
the
service
to
please
even
lord
privilege
i
looked
up
at
the
sky
as
soon
as
i
left
the
admiralty
portico
and
was
glad
to
see
that
the
weather
was
so
thick
and
the
telegraph
not
at
work
or
i
might
have
been
too
late
now
i
go
on
shore
and
report
myself
to
the
admiral
as
having
taken
the
command
of
the
went
on
shore
to
report
himself
was
well
received
by
the
admiral
who
informed
him
that
if
he
had
any
arrangements
to
make
he
could
not
be
too
soon
as
he
should
not
be
surprised
if
his
sailing
orders
came
down
the
next
morning
this
was
very
annoying
as
i
could
not
see
how
i
should
be
able
to
join
ship
even
if
i
could
effect
an
exchange
in
so
short
a
time
i
therefore
hastened
on
board
of
the
and
applied
to
the
officers
to
know
if
any
of
them
were
willing
to
exchange
into
the
but
although
they
did
not
much
like
going
to
the
east
indies
they
would
not
exchange
into
a
brig
and
i
returned
disappointed
the
next
morning
the
admiral
sent
for
and
told
him
confidentially
for
he
was
the
same
admiral
who
had
received
when
he
had
escaped
from
prison
with
me
and
was
very
kind
to
him
that
there
was
some
about
his
having
the
and
that
orders
had
come
down
to
pay
her
off
all
standing
and
examine
her
bottom
if
captain
had
not
joined
her
do
you
understand
what
this
means
said
the
admiral
who
was
anxious
to
know
the
reason
answered
frankly
that
lord
privilege
by
whose
interest
he
had
obtained
his
former
command
was
displeased
with
him
and
that
as
he
saw
him
go
up
to
the
first
lord
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
his
lordship
had
said
something
to
his
disadvantage
as
he
was
a
very
vindictive
man
well
said
the
admiral
it
lucky
that
you
have
taken
the
command
as
they
can
not
well
displace
you
or
send
her
into
dock
without
a
survey
and
upon
your
representation
and
so
it
proved
the
first
lord
when
he
found
that
had
joined
took
no
further
steps
but
allowed
the
frigate
to
proceed
to
her
intended
destination
but
all
chance
of
my
sailing
with
him
was
done
away
and
now
for
the
first
time
i
had
to
part
with
i
remained
with
him
the
whole
time
that
i
could
be
spared
from
my
duties
was
very
much
annoyed
but
there
was
no
help
never
mind
peter
said
he
i
been
thinking
that
perhaps
it
all
for
the
best
you
will
see
more
of
the
world
and
be
no
longer
in
you
are
now
a
fine
man
grown
up
big
enough
and
ugly
enough
as
they
say
to
take
care
of
yourself
we
shall
meet
again
and
if
we
do
why
then
god
bless
you
my
boy
and
do
forget
three
days
afterwards
orders
came
down
i
accompanied
him
on
board
and
it
was
not
until
the
ship
was
under
weigh
and
running
towards
the
needles
with
a
fair
wind
that
i
shook
hands
with
him
and
shoved
off
parting
with
was
a
heavy
blow
to
me
but
i
little
knew
how
much
i
was
to
suffer
before
i
saw
him
again
chapter
liii
i
am
pleased
with
my
new
captain
obtain
leave
to
go
home
find
my
father
afflicted
with
a
very
strange
disease
and
prove
myself
a
very
good
doctor
although
the
disorder
always
breaks
out
in
a
fresh
place
the
day
after
had
sailed
for
the
east
indies
the
dockyard
men
came
on
board
to
survey
the
brig
and
she
was
found
so
defective
as
to
be
ordered
into
dock
i
had
received
letters
from
my
sister
who
was
overjoyed
at
the
intelligence
of
my
safe
return
and
the
anticipation
of
seeing
me
the
accounts
of
my
father
were
however
very
unsatisfactory
my
sister
wrote
that
disappointment
and
anxiety
had
had
such
an
effect
upon
him
that
he
was
deranged
in
his
intellects
our
new
captain
came
down
to
join
us
he
was
a
very
young
man
and
had
never
before
commanded
a
ship
his
character
as
lieutenant
was
well
known
and
not
very
satisfactory
being
that
of
a
harsh
unpleasant
officer
but
as
he
had
never
been
first
lieutenant
it
was
impossible
to
say
what
he
might
prove
when
in
command
of
a
ship
still
we
were
a
little
anxious
about
it
and
severely
regretted
the
loss
of
he
came
on
board
the
hulk
to
which
the
ship
company
had
been
turned
over
and
read
his
commission
he
proved
to
be
all
affability
condescension
and
to
me
he
was
particularly
polite
stating
that
he
should
not
interfere
with
me
in
carrying
on
the
duty
as
i
must
be
so
well
acquainted
with
the
ship
company
we
thought
that
those
who
gave
us
the
information
must
have
been
prejudiced
or
mistaken
in
his
character
during
the
half
hour
that
he
remained
on
board
i
stated
that
now
that
the
brig
was
in
dock
i
should
like
very
much
to
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
my
friends
if
he
would
sanction
my
asking
for
leave
to
this
he
cheerfully
consented
adding
that
he
would
extend
it
upon
his
own
responsibility
my
letter
to
the
admiralty
was
therefore
forwarded
through
him
and
was
answered
in
the
affirmative
the
day
afterwards
i
set
off
by
the
coach
and
once
more
embraced
my
dear
sister
after
the
first
congratulations
were
over
i
inquired
about
my
father
she
replied
that
he
was
so
wild
that
nobody
could
manage
him
that
he
was
melancholy
and
irritable
at
the
same
time
and
was
certainly
deranged
fancying
himself
to
be
made
of
various
substances
or
to
be
in
a
certain
trade
or
capacity
that
he
generally
remained
in
this
way
four
or
five
days
when
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
for
hours
or
more
and
awoke
with
some
new
strange
imagination
in
his
head
his
language
was
violent
but
that
in
other
respects
he
seemed
to
be
more
afraid
of
other
people
than
inclined
to
be
mischievous
and
that
every
day
he
was
getting
more
strange
and
ridiculous
he
had
now
just
risen
from
one
of
his
long
naps
and
was
in
his
study
that
before
he
had
fallen
asleep
he
had
fancied
himself
to
be
a
carpenter
and
had
sawed
and
chopped
up
several
articles
of
furniture
in
the
house
i
quitted
my
sister
to
see
my
father
whom
i
found
in
his
i
was
much
shocked
at
his
appearance
he
was
thin
and
haggard
his
eye
was
wild
and
he
remained
with
his
mouth
constantly
open
a
who
had
been
hired
by
my
sister
was
standing
by
him
pish
pish
pish
pish
cried
my
father
what
can
you
a
stupid
old
woman
know
about
my
inside
i
tell
you
the
gas
is
generating
fast
and
even
now
i
can
hardly
keep
on
my
chair
i
lifting
lifting
now
and
if
you
do
tie
me
down
with
cords
i
shall
go
up
like
a
balloon
indeed
sir
replied
the
woman
it
only
the
wind
in
your
stomach
you
break
it
off
directly
it
inflammable
gas
you
old
hecate
i
know
it
is
tell
me
will
you
get
a
cord
or
will
you
not
hah
who
that
peter
why
you
dropped
from
the
clouds
just
in
time
to
see
me
mount
up
to
them
i
hope
you
feel
yourself
better
sir
said
i
i
feel
myself
a
great
deal
lighter
every
minute
get
a
cord
peter
and
tie
me
to
the
leg
of
the
table
i
tried
to
persuade
him
that
he
was
under
a
mistake
but
it
was
useless
he
became
excessively
violent
and
said
i
wished
him
in
heaven
as
i
had
heard
that
it
was
better
to
humour
people
afflicted
with
hypochondriacism
which
was
evidently
the
disease
under
which
my
father
laboured
i
tried
that
method
it
appears
to
me
sir
said
i
that
if
we
could
remove
the
gas
every
ten
minutes
it
would
be
a
good
plan
yes
but
how
replied
he
shaking
his
head
mournfully
why
with
a
syringe
sir
said
i
which
will
if
empty
of
course
draw
out
the
gas
when
inserted
into
your
mouth
my
dear
peter
you
have
saved
my
life
be
quick
though
or
i
shall
go
up
right
through
the
ceiling
fortunately
there
was
an
instrument
of
that
description
in
the
house
i
applied
it
to
his
mouth
drew
up
the
piston
and
then
ejected
the
air
and
it
in
two
minutes
he
pronounced
himself
better
and
i
left
the
old
nurse
hard
at
work
and
my
father
very
considerably
pacified
i
returned
to
my
sister
to
whom
i
recounted
what
had
passed
but
it
was
no
source
of
mirth
to
us
although
had
it
happened
to
an
indifferent
person
i
might
have
been
amused
the
idea
of
leaving
her
as
i
must
soon
do
having
only
a
fortnight
leave
to
be
worried
by
my
father
unfortunate
malady
was
very
distressing
but
we
entered
into
a
long
conversation
in
which
i
recounted
the
adventures
that
had
taken
place
since
i
had
left
her
and
for
the
time
forgot
our
source
of
annoyance
and
regret
for
three
days
my
father
insisted
upon
the
old
woman
pumping
the
gas
out
of
his
body
after
that
he
again
fell
into
one
of
his
sleeps
which
lasted
nearly
thirty
hours
when
he
arose
i
went
again
to
see
him
it
was
eight
in
the
evening
and
i
entered
with
a
candle
take
it
away
quick
take
it
away
put
it
out
carefully
why
what
the
matter
sir
do
come
near
me
if
you
love
me
do
come
near
me
put
it
out
i
say
put
it
out
i
obeyed
his
orders
and
then
asked
him
the
reason
reason
said
he
now
that
we
were
in
the
dark
ca
you
see
no
father
i
can
see
nothing
in
the
dark
well
then
peter
i
a
magazine
full
of
gunpowder
the
least
spark
in
the
world
and
i
am
blown
up
consider
the
danger
you
surely
would
not
be
the
destruction
of
your
father
peter
and
the
poor
old
gentleman
burst
into
tears
and
wept
like
a
child
i
knew
that
it
was
in
vain
to
reason
with
him
my
dear
father
said
i
on
board
ship
when
there
is
any
danger
of
this
kind
we
always
the
magazine
now
if
you
were
to
drink
a
good
deal
of
water
the
powder
would
be
spoiled
and
there
would
be
no
danger
my
father
was
satisfied
with
my
proposal
and
drank
a
tumbler
of
water
every
which
the
old
nurse
was
obliged
to
supply
as
fast
as
he
called
for
it
and
this
satisfied
him
for
three
or
four
days
and
i
was
again
left
to
the
company
of
my
dear
ellen
when
my
father
again
fell
into
his
stupor
and
we
wondered
what
would
be
his
next
fancy
i
was
hastily
summoned
by
the
nurse
and
found
my
poor
father
lying
in
bed
and
breathing
in
a
very
strange
manner
what
is
the
matter
my
dear
sir
inquired
i
why
do
you
see
what
is
the
matter
how
is
a
poor
little
infant
just
born
to
live
unless
its
mother
is
near
to
suckle
it
and
take
care
of
it
indeed
sir
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
are
just
born
to
be
sure
i
do
i
dying
for
the
breast
this
was
almost
too
absurd
but
i
gravely
observed
that
it
was
all
very
true
but
unfortunately
his
mother
had
died
in
childbirth
and
the
only
remedy
was
to
bring
him
up
by
hand
he
agreed
with
me
i
desired
the
nurse
to
make
some
gruel
with
brandy
and
feed
him
which
she
did
and
he
took
the
gruel
just
as
if
he
were
a
baby
i
was
about
to
wish
him
goodnight
when
he
beckoned
to
me
and
said
peter
she
has
changed
my
napkin
this
was
too
much
and
i
could
not
help
laughing
i
told
the
nurse
what
he
said
and
she
replied
lord
bless
you
sir
what
matter
if
the
old
gentleman
takes
a
fancy
why
not
indulge
him
i
fetch
the
kitchen
this
fit
lasted
about
six
days
for
he
went
to
sleep
because
a
baby
always
slept
much
and
i
was
in
hopes
it
would
last
much
longer
but
he
again
went
off
into
his
lethargic
fit
and
after
a
long
sleep
awoke
with
a
new
fancy
my
time
had
nearly
expired
and
i
had
written
to
my
new
captain
requesting
an
extension
of
leave
but
i
received
an
answer
stating
that
it
could
not
be
granted
and
requesting
me
to
join
the
brig
immediately
i
was
rather
surprised
at
this
but
of
course
was
compelled
to
obey
and
embracing
my
dear
sister
once
more
set
off
for
portsmouth
i
advised
her
to
humour
my
father
and
this
advice
she
followed
but
his
fancies
were
such
occasionally
as
would
have
puzzled
the
most
inventive
genius
to
combat
or
to
find
the
remedy
which
he
might
acknowledge
to
be
requisite
his
health
became
certainly
worse
and
worse
and
his
constitution
was
evidently
destroyed
by
a
slow
undermining
bodily
and
mental
fever
the
situation
of
my
poor
sister
was
very
distressing
and
i
quitted
her
with
melancholy
forebodings
i
ought
here
to
observe
that
i
received
all
my
amounting
to
a
large
sum
for
a
lieutenant
i
put
it
into
the
funds
and
gave
a
power
of
attorney
to
ellen
requesting
her
to
use
it
as
her
own
we
consulted
as
to
what
she
should
do
if
my
father
should
die
and
agreed
that
all
his
debts
which
we
knew
to
amount
to
three
or
four
hundred
pounds
should
be
paid
and
that
she
should
manage
how
she
could
upon
what
was
left
of
my
father
property
and
the
interest
of
my
chapter
liv
we
receive
our
sailing
orders
and
orders
of
every
description
a
conversation
listeners
never
hear
any
good
of
themselves
when
i
arrived
at
portsmouth
i
reported
myself
to
the
captain
who
lived
at
the
hotel
i
was
ushered
into
his
room
to
wait
for
him
as
he
was
dressing
to
dine
with
the
admiral
my
eyes
naturally
turned
to
what
lay
on
the
table
merely
from
the
feeling
which
one
has
to
pass
away
the
time
not
from
curiosity
and
i
was
much
surprised
to
see
a
pile
of
letters
the
uppermost
of
which
was
franked
by
lord
privilege
this
however
might
be
merely
accidental
but
my
curiosity
was
excited
and
i
lifted
up
the
letter
and
found
that
the
second
the
third
and
indeed
at
least
ten
of
these
were
franked
by
my
uncle
i
could
not
imagine
how
there
could
be
any
intimacy
between
him
and
my
uncle
and
was
reflecting
upon
it
when
captain
hawkins
for
that
was
his
name
entered
the
room
he
was
very
kind
and
civil
apologized
for
not
being
able
to
extend
my
leave
which
he
said
was
because
he
had
consulted
the
admiral
who
would
not
sanction
the
absence
of
the
first
lieutenant
and
had
very
peremptorily
desired
he
would
recall
me
immediately
i
was
satisfied
he
shook
my
hand
and
we
parted
on
my
arrival
on
board
the
hulk
for
the
brig
was
still
in
dock
i
was
warmly
received
by
my
messmates
they
told
me
that
the
captain
had
generally
speaking
been
very
civil
but
that
occasionally
the
marks
of
the
cloven
foot
appeared
webster
said
i
to
the
second
lieutenant
do
you
know
anything
about
his
family
or
connections
it
is
a
question
i
have
asked
of
those
who
have
sailed
with
him
and
they
all
say
that
he
never
speaks
of
his
own
family
but
very
often
boasts
of
his
intimacy
with
the
nobility
some
say
that
he
is
a
of
some
great
man
i
reflected
very
much
upon
this
and
connecting
it
with
the
numerous
franks
of
lord
privilege
which
i
saw
on
the
table
had
my
misgivings
but
then
i
knew
that
i
could
do
my
duty
and
had
no
reason
to
fear
any
man
i
resolved
in
my
own
mind
to
be
very
correct
and
put
it
out
of
the
power
of
any
one
to
lay
hold
of
me
and
then
dismissed
the
subject
the
brig
was
repaired
and
out
of
dock
and
for
some
days
i
was
very
busy
getting
her
ready
for
sea
i
never
quitted
her
in
fact
i
had
no
wish
i
never
had
any
taste
for
bad
company
and
midnight
orgies
and
i
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
respectable
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
portsmouth
at
last
the
ship
company
were
removed
into
the
brig
we
went
out
of
harbour
and
anchored
at
spithead
captain
hawkins
came
on
board
and
gave
me
an
saying
mr
simple
i
have
a
great
objection
to
written
orders
as
i
consider
that
the
articles
of
war
are
quite
sufficient
to
regulate
any
ship
still
a
captain
is
in
a
very
responsible
situation
and
if
any
accident
occurs
he
is
held
amenable
i
therefore
have
framed
a
few
orders
of
my
own
for
the
interior
discipline
of
the
vessel
which
may
probably
save
me
harmless
in
case
of
being
over
the
but
not
with
any
wish
that
they
should
interfere
with
the
comforts
of
the
officers
only
to
guard
against
any
mischance
of
which
the
may
fall
upon
myself
i
received
the
and
the
captain
went
ashore
when
i
went
down
into
the
to
look
through
it
i
at
once
perceived
that
if
rigidly
conformed
to
every
officer
in
the
ship
would
be
rendered
uncomfortable
and
if
not
conformed
to
i
should
be
the
party
that
was
answerable
i
showed
it
to
webster
who
agreed
with
me
and
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
captain
good
nature
and
amiability
were
all
a
blind
and
that
he
was
intending
to
lay
hold
of
us
as
soon
as
it
was
in
his
power
i
therefore
called
all
the
officers
together
and
told
them
my
opinion
webster
supported
me
and
it
was
unanimously
agreed
that
the
orders
should
be
obeyed
although
not
without
remonstrance
the
major
part
of
the
orders
however
only
referred
to
the
time
that
the
brig
was
in
harbour
and
as
we
were
about
to
proceed
to
sea
it
was
hardly
worth
while
saying
anything
at
present
the
orders
for
the
sailing
of
the
brig
came
down
and
by
the
same
post
i
received
a
letter
from
my
sister
ellen
stating
that
they
had
heard
from
captain
fielding
who
had
immediately
written
to
bombay
where
the
regiment
was
stationed
and
had
received
an
answer
informing
him
that
there
was
no
married
man
in
the
regiment
of
the
name
of
sullivan
and
no
woman
who
had
followed
that
regiment
of
that
name
this
at
once
put
an
end
to
all
our
researches
after
the
who
had
been
confined
in
my
uncle
house
where
she
had
been
sent
it
was
of
course
impossible
to
say
but
i
gave
up
all
chance
of
discovering
my
uncle
treachery
and
as
i
thought
of
celeste
sighed
at
the
little
hope
i
had
of
ever
being
united
to
her
i
wrote
a
long
letter
to
and
the
next
day
we
sailed
for
our
station
in
the
north
sea
the
captain
added
a
night
to
the
other
and
sent
it
up
every
evening
to
be
returned
in
the
morning
with
the
signature
of
every
officer
of
the
night
watches
he
also
required
all
our
signatures
to
his
general
that
we
might
not
say
we
had
not
read
them
i
had
the
first
watch
when
swinburne
came
up
to
me
well
mr
simple
i
do
not
think
we
have
made
much
by
our
exchange
of
captains
and
i
have
a
shrewd
suspicion
we
shall
have
squalls
ere
long
we
must
not
judge
too
hastily
swinburne
replied
i
no
no
i
do
say
that
we
should
but
still
one
must
go
a
little
by
looks
in
the
world
and
i
sure
his
looks
would
help
him
much
just
like
a
winter
day
short
and
dirty
and
he
walks
the
deck
as
if
planks
were
not
good
enough
for
his
feet
mr
williams
says
he
looks
as
if
he
were
with
the
fate
of
cato
and
of
rome
what
that
means
i
do
know
some
joke
i
suppose
for
the
youngsters
are
always
joking
were
you
ever
up
the
baltic
mr
simple
now
i
think
of
it
i
know
you
never
were
i
seen
some
tight
work
up
there
with
the
and
so
we
should
now
with
captain
but
as
for
this
little
man
an
idea
be
more
talk
than
work
you
appear
to
have
taken
a
great
dislike
to
the
captain
swinburne
i
do
not
know
whether
as
first
lieutenant
i
ought
to
listen
to
you
it
because
you
first
lieutenant
that
i
tell
it
you
mr
simple
i
never
was
mistaken
in
the
main
of
an
officer
character
when
i
could
look
him
in
the
face
and
hear
him
talk
for
half
an
hour
and
i
came
up
on
purpose
to
put
you
on
your
guard
for
i
feel
convinced
that
towards
you
he
means
mischief
what
does
he
mean
by
having
the
serjeant
of
marines
in
his
cabin
for
half
an
hour
every
morning
his
reports
as
master
of
arms
ought
to
come
through
you
as
first
lieutenant
but
he
means
him
as
a
spy
upon
all
and
upon
you
in
particular
the
fellow
has
begun
to
give
himself
airs
already
and
speaks
to
the
young
gentlemen
as
if
they
were
beneath
him
i
thought
you
might
not
know
it
mr
simple
so
i
thought
it
right
to
tell
you
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
swinburne
for
your
good
wishes
but
i
can
do
my
duty
and
why
should
i
fear
anything
a
man
may
do
his
duty
mr
simple
but
if
a
captain
is
determined
to
ruin
him
he
has
the
power
i
have
been
longer
in
the
service
than
you
have
and
have
been
wide
awake
only
be
careful
of
one
thing
mr
simple
i
beg
your
pardon
for
being
so
free
but
in
no
case
lose
your
temper
no
fear
of
that
swinburne
replied
i
it
very
easy
to
say
fear
of
that
mr
simple
but
recollect
you
have
not
yet
had
your
temper
tried
as
some
officers
have
you
have
always
been
treated
like
a
gentleman
but
should
you
find
yourself
treated
otherwise
you
have
too
good
blood
in
your
veins
not
to
speak
i
am
sure
of
that
i
seen
officers
insulted
and
irritated
till
no
angel
could
put
up
with
the
treatment
and
then
for
an
unguarded
word
which
they
would
have
been
not
to
have
made
use
of
sent
out
of
the
service
to
the
devil
but
you
forget
swinburne
that
the
articles
of
war
are
made
for
the
captain
as
well
as
for
everybody
else
in
the
ship
i
know
that
but
still
at
captains
make
a
great
distinction
between
what
a
superior
says
to
an
inferior
and
what
an
inferior
says
to
a
superior
true
replied
i
quoting
shakespeare
in
the
captain
but
a
choleric
word
which
in
the
soldier
is
rank
blasphemy
exactly
my
meaning
i
rather
think
said
swinburne
if
a
captain
calls
you
no
gentleman
you
say
the
same
to
him
certainly
not
but
i
can
demand
a
yes
and
it
will
be
granted
but
what
do
you
gain
by
that
it
like
beating
against
a
heavy
gale
and
a
lee
tide
thousand
to
one
if
you
fetch
your
port
and
if
you
do
your
vessel
is
strained
to
pieces
sails
worn
as
thin
as
a
newspaper
and
rigging
chafed
half
through
wanting
fresh
serving
no
orders
for
a
and
laid
up
in
ordinary
for
the
rest
of
your
life
no
no
mr
simple
the
best
plan
is
to
grin
and
bear
it
and
keep
a
sharp
for
depend
upon
it
mr
simple
in
the
best
ship
company
in
the
world
a
spy
captain
will
always
find
spy
followers
do
you
refer
that
observation
to
me
mr
swinburne
said
a
voice
from
under
the
bulwark
i
started
round
and
found
the
captain
who
had
crept
upon
deck
unperceived
by
us
during
our
conversation
swinburne
made
no
reply
but
touched
his
hat
and
walked
over
to
leeward
i
presume
mr
simple
said
the
captain
turning
to
me
that
you
consider
yourself
justified
in
finding
fault
and
abusing
your
captain
to
an
inferior
officer
on
his
majesty
if
you
heard
the
previous
conversation
sir
replied
i
you
must
be
aware
that
we
were
speaking
generally
about
i
do
not
imagine
that
i
have
been
guilty
of
any
impropriety
in
conversing
with
an
officer
upon
points
connected
with
the
service
you
mean
then
to
assert
sir
that
the
gunner
did
not
refer
to
me
when
he
said
the
words
captain
i
acknowledge
sir
that
as
you
were
listening
unperceived
the
term
might
appear
to
refer
to
you
but
the
gunner
had
no
idea
at
the
time
that
you
were
listening
his
observation
was
that
a
spy
captain
would
always
find
spy
followers
this
i
take
to
be
a
general
observation
and
i
am
sorry
that
you
think
otherwise
very
well
mr
simple
said
captain
hawkins
and
he
walked
down
the
companion
ladder
into
his
cabin
now
it
odd
mr
simple
that
i
should
come
up
with
the
intention
of
being
of
service
to
you
and
yet
get
you
into
such
a
scrape
however
perhaps
it
is
all
for
the
best
open
war
is
preferable
to
watching
in
the
dark
and
stabbing
in
the
back
he
never
meant
to
have
shown
his
colours
but
i
hit
him
so
hard
that
he
forgot
himself
i
suspect
that
to
be
the
case
swinburne
but
i
think
that
you
had
better
not
talk
any
more
with
me
wish
i
had
talked
quite
so
much
as
things
have
turned
out
replied
swinburne
sir
i
reflected
upon
what
had
passed
and
felt
convinced
that
swinburne
was
right
in
saying
that
it
was
better
this
had
occurred
than
otherwise
i
now
knew
the
ground
which
i
stood
upon
and
forewarned
was
being
forearmed
chapter
lv
we
encounter
a
dutch
brig
of
war
captain
hawkins
very
contemplative
near
the
capstan
hard
knocks
and
no
thanks
for
it
who
afraid
men
will
talk
the
brig
goes
about
on
the
wrong
tack
at
daylight
the
next
morning
we
were
off
the
texel
and
could
see
the
low
but
we
had
scarcely
made
them
out
when
the
fog
in
the
offing
cleared
up
and
we
made
a
strange
vessel
the
hands
were
turned
up
and
all
sail
made
in
chase
we
made
her
out
to
be
a
brig
of
war
and
as
she
altered
her
course
considerably
we
had
an
idea
that
she
was
an
enemy
we
made
the
private
signal
which
was
unanswered
and
we
cleared
for
action
the
brig
making
all
sail
on
the
starboard
tack
and
we
following
her
she
bearing
about
two
miles
on
our
weather
bow
the
breeze
was
not
steady
at
one
time
the
brig
was
staggering
under
her
sails
while
we
had
our
royals
set
at
another
we
would
have
hands
by
the
sheets
and
topsail
halyards
while
she
expanded
every
stitch
of
canvas
on
the
whole
however
in
an
hour
we
had
neared
about
half
a
mile
our
men
were
all
at
their
quarters
happy
to
be
so
soon
at
their
old
work
their
jackets
and
hats
were
thrown
off
a
bandana
handkerchief
tied
round
their
heads
and
another
or
else
their
black
silk
handkerchiefs
tied
round
their
waists
every
gun
was
ready
everything
was
in
its
place
and
every
soul
i
was
going
to
say
was
anxious
for
the
but
i
rather
think
i
must
not
include
the
captain
who
from
the
commencement
showed
no
signs
of
pleasure
and
anything
but
presence
of
mind
when
we
first
chased
the
vessel
it
was
reported
that
it
was
a
merchantman
and
it
was
not
until
we
had
broad
daylight
that
we
discovered
her
to
be
a
there
was
one
thing
to
be
said
in
his
favour
he
had
never
been
in
action
in
his
life
the
breeze
now
fell
light
and
we
were
both
with
our
sails
set
when
a
thick
fog
obscured
her
from
our
sight
the
fog
rolled
on
till
we
met
it
and
then
we
could
not
see
ten
yards
from
the
brig
this
was
a
source
of
great
mortification
as
we
had
every
chance
of
losing
her
fortunately
the
wind
was
settling
down
fast
into
a
calm
and
about
twelve
the
sails
flapped
against
the
mast
i
reported
twelve
and
asked
the
captain
whether
we
should
pipe
to
dinner
not
yet
replied
he
we
will
put
her
head
about
go
about
sir
replied
i
with
surprise
yes
said
he
i
convinced
that
the
chase
is
on
the
other
tack
at
this
moment
and
if
we
do
not
we
shall
lose
her
if
she
goes
about
sir
said
i
she
must
get
among
the
sands
and
we
shall
be
sure
of
her
sir
replied
he
when
i
ask
your
advice
you
will
be
pleased
to
give
it
i
command
this
vessel
i
touched
my
hat
and
turned
the
hands
up
about
ship
convinced
that
the
captain
wished
to
avoid
the
action
as
the
only
chance
of
escape
for
the
brig
was
her
keeping
her
wind
in
the
tack
she
was
on
ship
ship
cried
the
men
what
the
hell
are
we
going
about
for
inquired
they
of
one
another
as
they
came
up
the
ladder
silence
there
fore
and
aft
cried
i
captain
hawkins
i
do
not
think
we
can
get
her
round
unless
we
wear
the
wind
is
very
light
then
wear
ship
mr
simple
there
are
times
when
grumbling
and
discontent
among
the
seamen
is
so
participated
by
the
officers
although
they
do
not
show
it
that
the
expressions
made
use
of
are
passed
unheeded
such
was
the
case
at
present
the
officers
looked
at
each
other
and
said
nothing
but
the
men
were
unguarded
in
their
expressions
the
brig
wore
gradually
round
and
when
the
men
were
bracing
up
the
yards
sharp
on
the
other
tack
instead
of
the
hurrah
and
down
with
the
mark
they
fell
back
with
a
groan
brace
up
those
yards
in
silence
there
said
i
to
the
men
the
ropes
were
coiled
down
and
we
piped
to
dinner
the
captain
who
continued
on
deck
could
not
fail
to
hear
the
discontented
expressions
which
occasionally
were
made
use
of
on
the
lower
deck
he
made
no
observation
but
occasionally
looked
over
the
side
to
see
whether
the
brig
went
through
the
water
this
she
did
slowly
for
about
ten
minutes
when
it
fell
a
perfect
calm
so
that
to
use
a
common
sea
phrase
he
gained
little
by
his
motion
about
one
a
slight
breeze
from
the
opposite
quarter
sprung
up
we
turned
round
to
it
it
increased
the
fog
blew
away
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
chase
was
again
visible
now
upon
our
lee
beam
the
men
gave
three
cheers
silence
there
fore
and
aft
cried
the
captain
angrily
mr
simple
is
this
the
way
that
the
ship
company
have
been
disciplined
under
their
late
commander
to
halloo
and
bawl
whenever
they
think
proper
i
was
irritated
at
any
reflection
upon
and
i
replied
yes
sir
they
have
been
always
accustomed
to
express
their
joy
at
the
prospect
of
engaging
the
enemy
very
well
mr
simple
replied
he
how
are
we
to
shift
her
head
inquired
the
master
touching
his
hat
for
the
chase
of
course
replied
the
captain
who
then
descended
into
his
cabin
come
my
lads
said
swinburne
as
soon
as
the
captain
was
below
i
have
been
going
round
and
i
find
that
your
are
all
in
good
fighting
order
i
promise
ye
you
wait
for
powder
they
find
that
the
can
bite
devilish
hard
yet
i
expect
aye
and
without
its
too
replied
one
of
the
men
who
was
the
joe
miller
of
the
brig
the
chase
perceiving
that
she
could
not
escape
for
we
were
coming
up
with
her
hand
over
hand
now
shortened
sail
for
action
hoisting
dutch
colours
captain
hawkins
again
made
his
appearance
on
the
when
we
were
within
half
a
mile
of
her
are
we
to
run
alongside
of
her
or
how
inquired
i
mr
simple
i
command
her
replied
he
and
want
no
interference
whatever
very
well
sir
replied
i
and
i
walked
to
the
gangway
mr
thompson
cried
the
captain
who
appeared
to
have
screwed
up
his
courage
to
the
right
pitch
and
had
now
taken
his
position
for
a
moment
on
one
of
the
carronades
you
will
lay
the
brig
right
bang
bang
whiz
whiz
bang
whiz
came
three
shots
from
the
enemy
cleaving
the
air
between
our
masts
the
captain
jumped
down
from
the
carronade
and
hastened
to
the
capstern
without
finishing
his
sentence
shall
we
fire
when
we
are
ready
sir
said
i
for
i
perceived
that
he
was
not
capable
of
giving
correct
orders
yes
yes
to
be
sure
replied
he
remaining
where
he
was
thompson
said
i
to
the
master
i
think
we
can
manage
in
our
present
commanding
position
to
get
foul
of
him
so
as
to
knock
away
his
and
fore
topmast
and
then
she
ca
escape
we
have
good
way
on
her
i
manage
it
simple
or
my
name
not
thompson
replied
the
master
jumping
into
the
conning
the
vessel
in
that
exposed
situation
as
we
received
the
enemy
fire
look
out
my
lads
and
pour
it
into
her
now
just
as
you
please
said
i
to
the
men
the
seamen
were
however
too
well
disciplined
to
take
immediate
advantage
of
my
permission
they
waited
until
we
passed
her
and
just
as
the
master
put
up
his
helm
so
as
to
catch
her
between
our
masts
the
whole
broadside
was
poured
into
his
bow
and
her
and
went
down
and
she
had
so
much
way
through
the
water
that
we
tore
clear
from
her
and
rounding
to
the
wind
shot
the
enemy
although
in
confusion
from
the
effects
of
our
broadside
put
up
his
helm
to
rake
us
we
perceived
his
manoeuvre
and
did
the
same
and
then
squaring
our
sails
we
ran
with
him
before
the
wind
engaging
broadside
to
broadside
this
continued
about
half
an
hour
and
we
soon
found
that
we
had
no
fool
to
play
with
the
brig
was
well
fought
and
her
guns
well
directed
we
had
several
men
taken
down
below
and
i
thought
it
would
be
better
to
engage
her
even
closer
there
was
about
a
cable
length
between
both
vessels
as
we
ran
before
the
wind
at
about
six
miles
an
hour
with
a
slight
rolling
motion
thompson
said
i
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
beat
them
from
their
guns
let
port
the
helm
and
close
her
till
we
can
shy
a
biscuit
on
board
just
my
opinion
simple
we
see
if
they
wo
make
another
sort
of
running
fight
of
it
in
a
few
minutes
we
were
so
close
on
board
of
her
that
the
men
who
loaded
the
guns
could
touch
each
other
with
their
rammers
and
sponges
the
men
cheered
it
was
gallantly
returned
by
the
enemy
and
havoc
was
now
commenced
by
the
musketry
on
both
sides
the
french
captain
who
appeared
as
brave
a
fellow
as
ever
stepped
stood
for
some
minutes
on
the
hammocks
i
was
also
holding
on
by
the
swifter
of
the
main
rigging
when
he
took
off
his
hat
and
politely
saluted
me
i
returned
the
compliment
but
the
fire
became
too
hot
and
i
wished
to
get
under
the
shelter
of
the
bulwark
still
i
would
not
go
down
first
and
the
french
captain
appeared
determined
not
to
be
the
first
either
to
quit
the
post
of
honour
at
last
one
of
our
marines
hit
him
in
the
right
arm
he
clapped
his
hand
to
the
part
as
if
to
point
it
out
to
me
nodded
and
was
assisted
down
from
the
hammocks
i
immediately
quitted
my
post
for
i
thought
it
foolish
to
stand
as
a
mark
for
forty
or
fifty
soldiers
i
had
already
received
a
bullet
through
the
small
of
my
leg
but
the
effects
of
such
close
fire
now
became
apparent
our
guns
were
only
half
manned
our
sides
terribly
cut
up
and
our
sails
and
rigging
in
tatters
the
enemy
was
even
worse
off
and
two
broadsides
more
brought
her
mainmast
by
the
board
our
men
cheered
and
threw
in
another
broadside
the
enemy
dropped
astern
we
rounded
to
rake
her
she
also
attempted
to
round
to
but
could
not
until
she
had
cleared
away
her
wreck
and
taken
in
her
foresail
and
lowered
her
topsail
she
then
continued
the
action
with
as
much
spirit
as
ever
he
a
fine
fellow
by
god
exclaimed
thompson
i
never
saw
a
man
fight
his
ship
better
but
we
have
him
webster
down
poor
fellow
i
sorry
for
it
replied
i
but
i
afraid
that
there
are
many
poor
fellows
who
have
lost
the
number
of
their
mess
i
think
it
useless
throwing
away
the
advantage
which
we
now
have
he
ca
escape
and
he
fight
this
way
for
ever
we
had
better
run
repair
damages
and
then
he
must
surrender
in
his
crippled
state
when
we
attack
him
again
i
agree
with
you
said
thompson
the
only
point
is
that
it
will
soon
be
dark
i
not
lose
sight
of
him
and
he
can
not
get
away
if
he
puts
before
the
wind
then
we
will
be
at
him
again
we
gave
him
the
loaded
guns
as
we
forged
and
when
we
were
about
half
a
mile
from
him
to
repair
damages
the
reader
may
now
ask
but
where
was
the
captain
all
this
time
my
answer
is
that
he
was
at
the
capstern
where
he
stood
in
silence
not
once
interfering
during
the
whole
action
which
was
fought
by
thompson
the
master
and
myself
how
he
looked
or
how
he
behaved
in
other
points
during
the
engagement
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
for
i
had
no
time
to
observe
him
even
now
i
was
busy
knotting
the
rigging
rousing
up
new
sails
to
bend
and
getting
everything
in
order
and
i
should
not
have
observed
him
had
he
not
come
up
to
me
for
as
soon
as
we
had
ceased
firing
he
appeared
to
recover
himself
he
did
not
however
first
address
me
he
commenced
speaking
to
the
men
come
be
smart
my
lads
send
a
hand
here
to
swab
up
the
blood
here
youngster
run
down
to
the
surgeon
and
let
him
know
that
i
wish
a
report
of
the
killed
and
wounded
by
degrees
he
talked
more
and
at
last
came
up
to
me
this
has
been
rather
smartish
mr
simple
very
smart
indeed
sir
replied
i
and
then
turned
away
to
give
directions
maintop
there
send
down
the
hauling
line
on
the
starboard
side
ay
ay
sir
now
then
my
lads
clap
on
and
run
it
up
at
once
maintop
there
hailed
the
captain
be
a
little
smarter
or
by
g
d
i
call
you
down
for
something
this
did
not
come
with
a
good
grace
from
one
who
had
done
nothing
to
those
who
were
working
with
all
their
energy
mr
simple
said
the
captain
i
wish
you
would
carry
on
duty
with
less
noise
at
all
events
he
set
us
that
example
during
the
action
muttered
the
joe
miller
and
the
other
men
laughed
heartily
at
the
implication
in
two
hours
during
which
we
had
carefully
watched
the
enemy
who
still
lay
where
we
left
him
we
were
again
ready
for
action
shall
i
give
the
men
their
grog
now
sir
said
i
to
the
captain
they
must
want
it
no
no
replied
the
captain
no
no
mr
simple
i
do
like
what
you
call
courage
i
do
think
he
much
does
and
this
fellow
has
shown
plenty
of
it
said
the
joe
miller
softly
and
the
men
about
him
laughed
heartily
i
think
sir
observed
i
that
it
is
an
injustice
to
this
fine
company
to
hint
at
their
requiring
dutch
courage
dutch
courage
is
a
term
for
courage
screwed
up
by
drinking
freely
and
i
most
respectfully
beg
leave
to
observe
that
the
men
have
not
had
their
afternoon
allowance
and
after
the
fatigues
they
have
undergone
really
require
it
i
command
this
ship
sir
replied
he
certainly
sir
i
am
aware
of
it
rejoined
i
she
is
now
all
ready
for
action
again
and
i
wait
your
orders
the
enemy
is
two
miles
on
the
lee
quarter
the
surgeon
here
came
up
with
his
report
good
heavens
said
the
captain
men
killed
and
wounded
mr
webster
dangerously
why
the
brig
is
crippled
we
can
do
no
more
positively
we
can
do
no
more
can
take
that
brig
cried
one
of
the
seamen
from
a
dozen
of
the
men
who
were
to
leeward
expecting
orders
to
renew
the
attack
what
man
was
that
cried
the
captain
no
one
answered
by
g
d
this
ship
is
in
a
state
of
mutiny
mr
simple
will
be
i
think
said
a
voice
from
the
crowd
which
i
knew
very
well
but
the
captain
having
been
but
a
short
time
with
us
did
not
know
it
do
you
hear
that
mr
simple
cried
the
captain
i
regret
to
say
that
i
did
hear
it
sir
i
little
thought
that
ever
such
an
expression
would
have
been
made
use
of
on
board
of
the
then
fearing
he
would
ask
me
the
man
name
and
to
pretend
not
to
have
recognised
it
i
said
who
was
that
who
made
use
of
that
expression
but
no
one
answered
and
it
was
so
dark
that
it
was
impossible
to
distinguish
the
men
after
such
mutinous
expressions
observed
the
captain
i
certainly
will
not
risk
his
majesty
brig
under
my
command
as
i
should
have
wished
to
have
done
even
in
her
crippled
state
by
again
engaging
the
enemy
i
can
only
regret
that
the
officers
appear
as
insolent
as
the
men
perhaps
captain
hawkins
you
will
state
in
what
and
when
i
have
proved
myself
insolent
i
can
not
accuse
myself
i
hope
the
expression
was
not
applied
to
me
sir
said
thompson
the
master
touching
his
hat
silence
gentlemen
if
you
please
mr
simple
wear
round
the
ship
whether
the
captain
intended
to
attack
the
enemy
or
not
we
could
not
tell
but
we
were
soon
undeceived
for
when
we
were
round
he
ordered
her
to
be
kept
away
until
the
dutch
brig
was
on
our
lee
quarter
then
ordering
the
master
to
shape
his
course
for
yarmouth
he
went
down
into
the
cabin
and
sent
up
word
that
i
might
pipe
to
supper
and
serve
out
the
spirits
the
rage
and
indignation
of
the
men
could
not
be
withheld
after
they
went
down
to
supper
they
gave
three
heavy
groans
in
concert
indeed
during
the
whole
of
that
night
the
officers
who
kept
the
watches
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
the
men
from
venting
their
feeling
in
what
might
be
almost
termed
justifiable
mutiny
as
for
myself
i
could
hardly
control
my
vexation
the
brig
was
our
certain
prize
and
this
was
proved
for
the
next
day
she
hauled
down
her
colours
immediately
to
a
much
smaller
which
fell
in
with
her
still
lying
in
the
same
crippled
state
the
captain
and
first
lieutenant
killed
and
nearly
of
her
ship
company
either
killed
or
wounded
had
we
attacked
her
she
would
have
hauled
down
her
colours
immediately
for
it
was
our
last
broadside
which
had
killed
the
captain
as
first
lieutenant
i
should
have
received
my
promotion
which
was
now
lost
i
cried
for
vexation
when
i
thought
of
it
as
i
lay
in
bed
that
his
conduct
was
severely
commented
upon
by
the
officers
in
the
as
well
as
by
the
whole
ship
company
i
hardly
need
say
thompson
was
for
bringing
him
to
a
which
i
would
most
gladly
have
done
if
it
only
were
to
get
rid
of
him
but
i
had
a
long
conversation
with
old
swinburne
on
the
subject
and
he
proved
to
me
that
i
had
better
not
attempt
it
for
d
see
mr
simple
you
have
no
proof
he
did
not
run
down
below
he
stood
his
ground
on
deck
although
he
did
nothing
you
ca
cowardice
then
although
there
can
be
no
great
doubt
of
it
again
with
regard
to
his
not
renewing
the
attack
why
is
not
a
captain
at
liberty
to
decide
what
is
the
best
for
his
majesty
service
and
if
he
thought
in
the
crippled
state
of
the
brig
so
close
to
the
enemy
coast
that
it
was
advisable
why
it
could
only
be
brought
in
as
an
error
in
judgment
then
there
another
thing
which
must
be
remembered
mr
simple
which
is
that
no
captains
sitting
on
a
will
if
it
be
possible
to
extricate
him
ever
prove
against
a
brother
captain
because
they
feel
that
it
a
disgrace
to
the
whole
cloth
swinburne
advice
was
good
and
i
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
proceeding
still
it
appeared
to
me
that
the
captain
was
very
much
afraid
that
i
would
he
was
so
extremely
amiable
and
polite
during
our
run
home
he
said
that
he
had
watched
how
well
i
had
behaved
in
the
action
and
would
not
fail
to
notice
it
this
was
something
but
he
did
not
keep
his
word
for
his
despatch
was
published
before
we
quitted
the
roadstead
and
not
the
name
of
one
officer
mentioned
only
generally
saying
that
they
conducted
themselves
to
his
satisfaction
he
called
the
enemy
a
corvette
not
specifying
whether
she
was
a
brig
or
ship
corvette
and
the
whole
was
written
in
such
a
bombastic
style
that
any
one
would
have
imagined
that
he
had
fought
a
vessel
of
superior
force
he
stated
at
the
end
that
as
soon
as
he
repaired
damages
he
wore
round
but
that
the
enemy
declined
further
action
so
she
did
certainly
for
the
best
of
all
possible
reasons
that
she
was
too
disabled
to
come
down
to
us
all
this
might
have
been
contested
but
the
enormous
list
of
killed
and
wounded
proved
that
we
had
had
a
hard
fight
and
the
capture
of
the
brig
afterwards
that
we
had
really
overpowered
her
so
that
on
the
whole
captain
hawkins
gained
a
great
deal
of
credit
with
some
although
whispers
were
afloat
which
came
to
the
ears
of
the
admiralty
and
prevented
him
from
being
posted
the
more
so
as
he
had
the
modesty
not
to
apply
for
it
chapter
lvi
consequences
of
the
action
a
ship
without
a
fighting
captain
is
like
a
thing
without
a
head
so
do
the
sailors
think
a
mutiny
and
the
loss
of
our
famous
ship
company
during
our
stay
at
yarmouth
we
were
not
allowed
to
put
our
foot
on
shore
upon
the
plea
that
we
must
repair
damages
and
proceed
immediately
to
our
station
but
the
real
fact
was
that
captain
hawkins
was
very
anxious
that
we
should
not
be
able
to
talk
about
the
action
finding
no
charges
preferred
against
him
he
his
system
of
annoyance
his
apartments
had
windows
which
looked
out
upon
where
the
brig
lay
at
anchor
and
he
constantly
watched
all
our
motions
with
his
noting
down
if
i
did
not
hoist
up
boats
exactly
at
the
hour
prescribed
in
his
book
of
orders
so
as
to
gather
a
list
of
charges
against
me
if
he
could
this
we
did
not
find
out
until
afterwards
i
mentioned
before
that
when
swinburne
joined
us
at
plymouth
he
had
recommended
a
being
put
on
the
brig
this
had
been
done
at
expense
not
in
the
cheap
way
recommended
by
swinburne
but
in
a
very
handsome
manner
it
was
a
large
snake
coiled
up
in
folds
with
its
head
darting
out
in
a
menacing
attitude
and
the
tail
with
its
rattle
appeared
below
the
whole
was
gilded
and
had
a
very
good
effect
but
after
the
men
had
completed
the
repairs
and
the
brig
was
painted
one
night
the
head
of
the
rattlesnake
disappeared
it
had
been
sawed
off
by
some
malicious
and
evil
disposed
persons
and
no
traces
of
it
were
to
be
found
i
was
obliged
to
report
this
to
the
captain
who
was
very
indignant
and
offered
twenty
pounds
for
the
discovery
of
the
offender
but
had
he
offered
twenty
thousand
he
never
would
have
found
out
the
delinquent
it
was
however
never
forgotten
for
he
understood
what
was
implied
by
these
manoeuvres
a
new
head
was
carved
but
disappeared
the
night
after
it
was
fixed
on
the
rage
of
the
captain
was
without
bounds
he
turned
the
hands
up
and
declared
that
if
the
offender
was
not
given
up
he
would
flog
every
hand
on
board
he
gave
the
ship
company
ten
minutes
and
then
prepared
to
execute
his
threat
mr
paul
turn
the
hands
up
for
punishment
said
the
captain
in
a
rage
and
descended
to
his
cabin
for
the
articles
of
war
when
he
was
down
below
the
officers
talked
over
the
matter
to
flog
every
man
for
the
crime
of
one
was
the
height
of
injustice
but
it
was
not
for
us
to
oppose
him
still
the
ship
company
must
have
seen
in
our
countenances
that
we
shared
their
feelings
the
men
were
talking
with
each
other
in
groups
until
they
all
appeared
to
have
communicated
their
ideas
on
the
subject
the
carpenters
who
had
been
slowly
bringing
aft
the
gratings
left
off
the
job
the
boatswain
mates
who
had
came
aft
rolled
the
tails
of
their
cats
round
the
red
handles
and
every
man
walked
down
below
no
one
was
left
on
the
but
the
marines
under
arms
and
the
officers
perceiving
this
i
desired
mr
paul
the
boatswain
to
send
the
men
up
to
rig
the
gratings
and
the
with
their
seizings
he
came
up
and
said
that
he
had
called
them
but
that
they
did
not
answer
perceiving
that
the
company
would
break
out
into
open
mutiny
if
the
captain
persisted
in
his
intention
i
went
down
into
the
cabin
and
told
the
captain
the
state
of
things
and
wished
for
his
orders
or
presence
on
deck
the
captain
whose
wrath
appeared
incapable
of
reflection
immediately
proceeded
on
deck
and
ordered
the
marines
to
load
with
this
was
done
but
as
i
was
afterwards
told
by
thompson
who
was
standing
aft
the
marines
loaded
with
powder
and
put
the
balls
into
their
pockets
they
wished
to
keep
up
the
character
of
their
corps
for
fidelity
and
at
the
same
time
not
fire
upon
men
whom
they
loved
as
brothers
and
with
whom
they
coincided
in
opinion
indeed
we
afterwards
discovered
that
it
was
a
who
had
taken
off
the
of
the
snake
a
second
time
the
captain
then
ordered
the
boatswain
to
turn
the
hands
up
the
boatswain
made
his
appearance
with
his
right
arm
in
a
the
matter
with
your
arm
mr
paul
said
i
as
he
passed
me
tumbled
down
the
hatchway
just
now
ca
move
my
arm
i
must
go
to
the
surgeon
as
soon
as
this
is
over
the
hands
were
piped
up
again
but
no
one
obeyed
the
order
thus
was
the
brig
in
a
state
of
mutiny
mr
simple
go
forward
to
the
main
hatchway
with
the
marines
and
fire
on
the
lower
deck
cried
the
captain
sir
said
i
there
are
two
frigates
within
a
cable
length
of
us
and
would
it
not
be
better
to
send
for
assistance
without
shedding
blood
besides
sir
you
have
not
yet
tried
the
effect
of
calling
up
the
carpenter
and
boatswain
mates
by
name
will
you
allow
me
to
go
down
first
and
bring
them
to
a
sense
of
their
duty
yes
i
presume
you
know
your
power
but
of
this
hereafter
i
went
down
below
and
called
the
men
by
name
sir
said
one
of
the
boatswain
mates
the
ship
company
say
that
they
will
not
submit
to
be
flogged
i
do
not
speak
to
the
ship
company
generally
collins
replied
i
but
you
are
now
ordered
to
rig
the
gratings
and
come
on
deck
it
is
an
order
that
you
can
not
refuse
go
up
directly
and
obey
it
go
on
deck
with
your
seizings
when
all
is
ready
you
can
then
expostulate
the
men
obeyed
my
orders
they
crawled
on
deck
rigged
the
gratings
and
stood
by
all
is
ready
sir
said
i
touching
my
hat
to
the
captain
send
the
ship
company
aft
mr
paul
aft
then
all
of
you
for
punishment
cried
the
boatswain
yes
it
is
of
us
for
cried
one
voice
we
all
to
flog
one
another
and
then
pay
off
the
this
time
the
men
obeyed
the
order
they
all
appeared
on
the
the
men
are
all
aft
sir
reported
the
boatswain
and
now
my
lads
said
the
captain
i
teach
you
what
mutiny
is
you
see
the
two
frigates
alongside
of
us
you
had
forgotten
them
i
suppose
but
i
had
here
you
scoundrel
mr
jones
this
was
the
joe
miller
strip
sir
if
ever
there
was
mischief
in
a
ship
you
are
at
the
head
head
sir
said
the
man
assuming
a
vacant
look
what
head
sir
do
you
mean
the
snake
head
i
do
know
anything
about
it
sir
strip
sir
cried
the
captain
in
a
rage
i
soon
bring
you
to
your
senses
if
you
please
your
honour
what
have
i
done
to
be
tied
up
said
the
man
strip
you
scoundrel
well
sir
if
you
please
it
hard
to
be
flogged
for
nothing
the
man
pulled
off
his
clothes
and
walked
up
to
the
grating
the
seized
him
up
seized
up
sir
reported
the
scoundrel
of
a
sergeant
of
marines
who
acted
as
the
captain
spy
the
captain
looked
for
the
articles
of
war
to
read
as
is
necessary
previous
to
punishing
a
man
and
was
a
little
puzzled
to
find
one
where
no
positive
offence
had
been
committed
at
last
he
pitched
upon
the
one
which
refers
to
combination
and
conspiracy
and
creating
discontent
we
all
took
off
our
hats
as
he
read
it
and
he
then
called
mr
paul
the
boatswain
and
ordered
him
to
give
the
man
a
dozen
please
sir
said
the
boatswain
pointing
to
his
arm
in
a
sling
i
ca
flog
i
lift
up
my
arm
your
arm
was
well
enough
when
i
came
on
board
sir
cried
the
captain
yes
sir
but
in
hurrying
the
men
up
i
slipped
down
the
ladder
and
i
afraid
i
put
my
shoulder
out
the
captain
bit
his
lips
he
fully
believed
it
was
a
sham
on
the
part
of
the
boatswain
which
indeed
it
was
to
get
off
flogging
the
men
well
then
where
is
the
chief
boatswain
mate
miller
here
sir
said
miller
coming
forward
a
stout
muscular
man
nearly
six
feet
high
with
a
nearly
four
feet
long
and
his
open
breast
covered
with
black
shaggy
hair
give
that
man
a
dozen
sir
said
the
captain
the
man
looked
at
the
captain
then
at
the
ship
company
and
then
at
the
man
seized
up
but
did
not
commence
the
punishment
do
you
hear
me
sir
roared
the
captain
if
you
please
your
honour
i
rather
take
my
disrating
i
do
wish
to

this
here

your
orders
immediately
sir
cried
the
captain
or
by
god
i
try

for
mutiny
well
sir
i
beg
your
pardon
but
what
must
be
must
be
i

disrespect
captain
hawkins
but
i
can
not
flog
that
man
my
conscience
wo
let
me
your
sir
beg
your
pardon
captain
hawkins
i
always
done
my
duty
foul
weather
or
fair
and
i
been
eighteen
years
in
his
majesty
service
without
ever
being
brought
to
punishment
but
if
i
am
to
be
hung
now
saving
your
pleasure
and
with
all
respect
i
ca
help
it
i
give
you
but
one
moment
more
sir
cried
the
captain
do
your
duty
the
man
looked
at
the
captain
and
then
eyed
the
captain
hawkins
i
will
my
although
i
must
swing
for
it
so
saying
he
threw
his
cat
down
on
the
and
fell
back
among
the
ship
company
the
captain
was
now
confounded
and
hardly
knew
how
to
act
to
persevere
appeared
useless
to
fall
back
was
almost
as
impossible
a
dead
silence
of
a
minute
ensued
every
one
was
breathless
with
impatience
to
know
what
would
be
done
next
the
silence
was
however
first
broken
by
jones
the
joe
miller
who
was
seized
up
beg
your
honour
pardon
sir
said
he
turning
his
head
round
but
if
i
am
to
be
flogged
will
you
be
pleased
to
let
me
have
it
over
i
shall
catch
my
death
naked
here
all
day
this
was
decided
mockery
on
the
part
of
the
man
and
roused
the
captain
sergeant
of
marines
put
miller
and
that
man
collins
both
legs
in
irons
for
mutiny
my
men
i
perceive
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
in
the
ship
but
i
shall
very
soon
put
an
end
to
it
i
know
the
men
and
by
god
they
shall
repent
it
mr
paul
pipe
down
mr
simple
man
my
gig
and
recollect
it
my
positive
orders
that
no
boat
goes
on
shore
the
captain
left
the
brig
looking
daggers
at
me
as
he
went
over
the
side
but
i
had
done
my
duty
and
cared
little
for
that
indeed
i
was
now
watching
his
conduct
as
carefully
as
he
did
mine
the
captain
wishes
to
tell
his
own
story
first
said
thompson
coming
up
to
me
now
if
i
were
you
simple
i
would
take
care
that
the
real
facts
should
be
known
how
that
to
be
done
replied
i
he
has
ordered
no
communication
with
the
shore
simply
by
sending
an
officer
on
board
of
each
of
the
frigates
to
state
that
the
brig
is
in
a
state
of
mutiny
and
request
that
they
will
keep
a
upon
her
this
is
no
more
than
your
duty
as
commanding
officer
you
only
send
the
message
leave
me
to
state
the
facts
of
my
own
accord
recollect
that
the
captains
of
these
frigates
will
be
summoned
if
there
is
a
court
of
inquiry
which
i
expect
will
take
place
i
considered
a
little
and
thought
the
advice
good
i
despatched
thompson
first
to
one
frigate
and
then
to
the
other
the
next
day
the
captain
came
on
board
as
soon
as
he
stepped
on
the
he
inquired
how
i
dare
disobey
his
orders
in
sending
the
boats
away
my
reply
was
that
his
orders
were
not
to
communicate
with
the
shore
but
that
as
commanding
officer
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
make
known
to
the
other
ships
that
the
men
were
in
a
state
of
insubordination
that
they
might
keep
their
eyes
upon
us
he
his
upon
me
for
some
time
and
then
turned
away
without
reply
as
we
expected
a
court
of
inquiry
was
called
upon
his
representations
to
the
admiral
about
twenty
of
the
men
were
examined
but
so
much
came
out
as
to
the
the
head
of
the
snake
had
been
removed
for
the
sailors
spoke
boldly
that
the
admiral
and
officers
who
were
appointed
strongly
recommended
captain
hawkins
not
to
proceed
further
than
to
state
that
there
were
some
disaffected
characters
in
the
ship
and
move
the
admiral
to
have
them
exchanged
into
others
this
was
done
and
the
captains
of
the
frigates
who
immediately
gave
their
advice
divided
all
our
best
men
between
them
they
spoke
very
freely
to
me
and
asked
me
who
were
the
best
men
which
i
told
them
honestly
for
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
get
them
out
of
the
power
of
captain
hawkins
these
they
marked
as
disaffected
and
exchanged
them
for
all
the
worst
they
had
on
board
the
few
that
were
left
ran
away
and
thus
from
having
one
of
the
finest
and
best
organised
ship
companies
in
the
service
we
were
now
one
of
the
very
worst
miller
was
sent
on
board
of
the
frigate
and
under
surveillance
he
soon
proved
that
his
character
was
as
good
as
i
stated
it
to
be
and
two
years
afterwards
was
promoted
to
the
rank
of
boatswain
webster
the
second
lieutenant
would
not
rejoin
us
and
another
was
appointed
i
must
here
remark
that
there
is
hardly
any
degree
of
severity
which
a
captain
may
not
exert
towards
his
seamen
provided
they
are
confident
of
or
he
has
proved
to
them
his
courage
but
if
there
be
a
doubt
or
a
confirmation
to
the
contrary
all
discipline
is
destroyed
by
contempt
and
the
ship
company
mutiny
either
directly
or
indirectly
there
is
an
old
saying
that
all
tyrants
are
cowards
that
tyranny
is
in
itself
a
species
of
meanness
i
acknowledge
but
still
the
saying
ought
to
be
modified
if
it
is
asserted
that
all
mean
tyrants
are
cowards
i
agree
but
i
have
known
in
the
service
most
special
tyrants
who
were
not
cowards
their
tyranny
was
excessive
but
there
was
no
meanness
in
their
dispositions
on
the
contrary
they
were
generous
and
occasionally
when
not
influenced
by
anger
proved
that
their
hearts
if
not
quite
right
were
not
very
much
out
of
their
places
yet
they
were
tyrants
but
although
tyrants
the
men
forgave
them
and
one
kind
act
when
they
were
not
led
away
by
the
impetuosity
of
their
feelings
obliterated
a
hundred
acts
of
tyranny
but
such
is
not
the
case
in
our
service
with
men
who
in
their
tyranny
are
mean
the
seamen
show
no
quarter
to
them
and
will
undergo
all
the
risk
which
the
severity
of
the
articles
of
war
renders
them
liable
to
rather
than
not
express
their
opinion
of
a
man
whom
they
despise
i
do
not
like
to
mention
names
but
i
could
point
out
specimens
of
brave
tyrants
and
of
cowardly
tyrants
who
have
existed
and
do
even
now
exist
in
our
service
the
present
regulations
have
limited
tyranny
to
a
certain
degree
but
it
can
not
check
the
tyrant
for
it
is
not
in
points
of
consequence
likely
to
be
brought
before
the
notice
of
his
superiors
that
he
effects
his
purpose
he
resorts
to
paltry
measures
he
smiles
that
he
may
betray
he
confines
himself
within
the
limit
that
may
protect
him
and
he
is
never
exposed
unless
by
his
courage
being
called
in
question
which
but
rarely
occurs
and
when
it
does
occur
it
is
most
difficult
as
well
as
most
dangerous
to
attempt
to
prove
it
it
may
be
asked
why
i
did
not
quit
the
ship
after
having
been
aware
of
the
character
of
the
captain
and
the
enmity
which
he
bore
to
me
in
reply
i
can
only
say
that
i
did
often
think
of
it
talked
over
the
subject
with
my
messmates
but
they
persuaded
me
to
remain
and
as
i
was
a
first
lieutenant
and
knew
that
any
successful
action
would
in
all
probability
insure
my
promotion
i
determined
to
use
a
nautical
expression
to
rough
it
out
and
not
throw
away
the
only
chance
which
i
now
had
of
obtaining
my
rank
as
commander

news
from
home
not
very
agreeable
although
the
reader
may
laugh
we
arrive
at
portsmouth
where
i
fall
in
with
my
old
acquaintance
mrs
trotter
we
sail
with
a
convoy
for
the
baltic
i
had
written
to
my
sister
ellen
giving
her
an
account
of
all
that
had
passed
and
mentioning
the
character
of
the
captain
and
his
apparent
intimacy
with
my
uncle
i
received
an
answer
from
her
telling
me
that
she
had
discovered
from
a
very
communicative
old
maiden
lady
that
captain
hawkins
was
an
illegitimate
son
of
my
uncle
by
a
lady
with
whom
he
had
been
acquainted
about
the
time
that
he
was
in
the
army
i
immediately
conceived
the
truth
that
my
uncle
had
pointed
me
out
to
him
as
an
object
of
his
vengeance
and
that
captain
hawkins
was
too
dutiful
and
too
dependent
a
son
not
to
obey
him
the
state
of
my
father
was
more
distressing
than
ever
but
there
was
something
very
ludicrous
in
his
fancies
he
had
fancied
himself
a
jackass
and
had
brayed
for
a
week
kicking
the
old
nurse
in
the
stomach
so
as
to
double
her
up
like
a
hedgehog
he
had
taken
it
into
his
head
that
he
was
a
pump
and
with
one
arm
held
out
as
a
spout
he
had
obliged
the
poor
old
nurse
to
work
the
other
up
and
down
for
hours
together
at
another
time
he
had
an
idea
that
he
was
a
woman
in
labour
and
they
were
obliged
to
give
him
a
strong
dose
of
calomel
and
borrow
a
child
of
six
years
old
from
a
neighbour
to
make
him
believe
that
he
was
delivered
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
although
the
child
was
born
to
him
in
cloth
trousers
and
a
jacket
with
three
rows
of
buttons
aye
said
he
it
was
those
buttons
which
hurt
my
side
so
much
in
fact
there
was
a
string
of
strange
conceptions
of
this
kind
that
had
accumulated
so
as
to
drive
my
poor
sister
almost
mad
and
sometimes
his
ideas
would
be
attended
with
a
very
heavy
expense
as
he
would
send
for
architects
make
contracts
for
building
supposing
himself
to
have
come
to
the
title
and
property
of
his
brother
this
being
the
basis
of
his
disease
occurred
frequently
i
wrote
to
poor
ellen
giving
her
my
best
advice
and
by
this
time
the
brig
was
again
ready
for
sea
and
we
expected
to
sail
immediately
i
did
not
forget
to
write
to
but
the
distance
between
us
was
so
great
that
i
knew
i
could
not
obtain
his
answer
probably
for
a
year
and
i
felt
a
melancholy
foreboding
how
much
i
required
his
advice
our
orders
were
to
proceed
to
portsmouth
and
join
a
convoy
collected
there
bound
up
the
baltic
under
the
charge
of
the
frigate
and
two
other
vessels
we
did
not
sail
with
any
pleasure
or
hopes
of
gaining
much
in
the
way
of
our
captain
was
enough
to
make
any
ship
a
hell
and
our
ship
company
were
composed
of
a
mutinous
and
incorrigible
set
of
scoundrels
with
of
course
a
few
exceptions
how
different
did
the
officers
find
the
brig
after
losing
such
a
captain
as
and
so
fine
a
ship
company
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
all
we
had
to
do
was
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
hope
for
better
times
the
cat
was
at
work
nearly
every
day
and
i
must
acknowledge
that
generally
speaking
it
was
deserved
although
sometimes
a
report
from
the
sergeant
of
marines
of
any
good
man
favoured
by
me
was
certain
to
be
attended
to
this
system
of
receiving
reports
direct
from
an
inferior
officer
instead
of
through
me
as
first
lieutenant
became
so
annoying
that
i
resolved
at
all
risk
to
expostulate
i
soon
had
an
opportunity
for
one
morning
the
captain
said
to
me
mr
simple
i
understand
that
you
had
a
fire
in
the
galley
last
night
after
hours
it
is
very
true
sir
that
i
did
order
a
stove
to
be
lighted
but
may
i
inquire
whether
the
first
lieutenant
has
not
a
discretionary
power
in
that
point
and
further
how
it
is
that
i
am
reported
to
you
by
other
people
the
discipline
of
this
ship
is
carried
on
by
me
under
your
directions
and
all
reports
ought
to
come
through
me
and
i
can
not
understand
upon
what
grounds
you
permit
them
through
any
other
channel
i
command
my
own
ship
sir
and
shall
do
as
i
please
in
that
respect
when
i
have
officers
i
can
confide
in
i
shall
in
all
probability
allow
them
to
report
to
me
if
there
is
anything
in
my
conduct
which
has
proved
to
you
that
i
am
incapable
or
not
trustworthy
i
would
feel
obliged
to
you
sir
if
you
would
in
the
first
place
point
it
out
and
in
the
next
bring
me
to
a
if
i
do
not
correct
it
i
am
no
man
sir
replied
he
but
i
am
not
to
be
dictated
to
by
an
inferior
officer
so
you
oblige
me
by
holding
your
tongue
the
sergeant
of
marines
as
is
bound
to
report
to
me
any
deviation
from
the
regulations
i
have
laid
down
for
the
discipline
of
the
ship
granted
sir
but
that
report
according
to
the
custom
of
the
service
should
come
through
the
first
lieutenant
i
prefer
it
coming
direct
sir
it
stands
less
chance
of
being
garbled
thank
you
captain
hawkins
for
the
compliment
the
captain
walked
away
without
further
reply
and
shortly
after
went
down
below
swinburne
ranged
up
alongside
of
me
as
soon
as
the
captain
disappeared
well
mr
simple
so
i
hear
we
are
bound
to
the
baltic
why
they
have
ordered
us
to
pick
up
the
convoy
off
yarmouth
instead
of
coming
all
the
way
to
portsmouth
we
shall
be
in
with
this
slant
of
wind
i
suppose
the
convoy
are
not
yet
collected
swinburne
and
you
recollect
there
no
want
of
french
privateers
in
the
channel
very
true
sir
when
were
you
up
the
baltic
swinburne
i
was
in
the
old
a
regular
old
she
sailed
just
like
a
one
mile
ahead
and
three
to
leeward
lord
bless
you
mr
simple
the
cattegat
was
wide
enough
for
her
but
she
was
a
comfortable
sort
of
vessel
after
all
excepting
on
a
so
we
used
always
to
give
the
land
a
wide
berth
i
recollect
by
the
bye
mr
simple
do
you
recollect
how
angry
you
were
because
i
did
peach
at
barbadoes
when
the
men
the
monkey
to
be
sure
i
do
well
then
i
did
think
it
fair
then
as
i
was
one
of
them
but
now
that
i
a
bit
of
an
officer
i
just
tell
you
that
when
we
get
to
carlscrona
there
a
method
of
the
there
which
as
first
lieutenant
with
such
a
queer
sort
of
captain
it
is
just
as
well
that
you
should
be
up
to
in
the
old
we
had
seventy
men
drunk
one
afternoon
and
the
first
lieutenant
could
find
it
out
nohow
indeed
swinburne
you
must
let
me
into
that
secret
so
i
will
mr
simple
do
you
know
there
a
famous
stuff
for
cuts
and
wounds
called
balsam
what
riga
balsam
yes
that
it
well
all
the
boats
will
bring
that
for
sale
as
they
did
to
us
in
the
old
devilish
good
stuff
it
is
for
wounds
i
believe
but
it
not
bad
to
drink
and
it
very
strong
we
used
to
take
it
mr
simple
and
the
first
lieutenant
never
guessed
it
what
you
all
got
tipsy
upon
riga
balsam
all
that
could
so
i
just
give
you
a
hint
i
much
obliged
to
you
swinburne
i
certainly
never
should
have
suspected
it
i
believe
seamen
would
get
drunk
upon
anything
the
next
morning
we
anchored
at
spithead
and
found
the
convoy
ready
for
sea
the
captain
went
on
shore
to
report
himself
to
the
admiral
and
as
usual
the
brig
was
surrounded
with
bumboats
and
wherries
with
people
who
wished
to
come
on
board
as
we
were
not
known
on
the
portsmouth
station
and
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
people
all
the
bumboats
were
very
anxious
to
supply
the
ship
and
as
this
is
at
the
option
of
the
first
lieutenant
he
is
very
much
persecuted
until
he
has
made
his
decision
certificates
of
good
conduct
from
other
officers
were
handed
up
the
side
from
all
of
them
and
i
looked
over
the
books
at
the
capstern
in
the
second
book
the
name
struck
me
it
was
that
of
mrs
trotter
and
i
walked
to
the
gangway
out
of
curiosity
to
ascertain
whether
it
was
the
same
personage
who
when
i
was
a
youngster
had
taken
such
care
of
my
shirts
as
i
looked
at
the
boats
a
voice
cried
out
o
mr
simple
have
you
forgot
your
old
friend
do
you
recollect
mrs
trotter
i
certainly
did
not
recollect
her
she
had
grown
very
fat
and
although
more
advanced
in
years
was
a
woman
than
when
i
had
first
seen
her
for
she
looked
healthy
and
fresh
indeed
i
hardly
did
recollect
you
mrs
trotter
i
so
much
to
tell
you
mr
simple
replied
she
ordering
the
boat
to
pull
alongside
and
as
she
was
coming
up
desired
the
man
to
get
the
things
in
as
if
permission
was
quite
unnecessary
i
did
not
it
as
i
knew
none
of
the
others
and
as
far
as
honesty
was
concerned
believed
them
all
to
be
much
on
a
par
on
the
strength
then
of
old
acquaintance
mrs
trotter
was
admitted
well
i
sure
mr
simple
cried
mrs
trotter
out
of
breath
with
climbing
up
the
brig
side
what
a
man
you
grown
and
such
a
handsome
man
too
dear
dear
it
makes
me
feel
quite
old
to
look
at
you
when
i
call
to
mind
the
little
boy
whom
i
had
charge
of
in
the
cockpit
do
you
think
i
look
very
old
and
ugly
mr
simple
continued
she
smiling
and
smirking
indeed
mrs
trotter
i
think
you
wear
very
well
pray
how
is
your
husband
ah
mr
simple
poor
dear
mr
trotter
he
gone
poor
fellow
no
wonder
what
with
his
drinking
and
his
love
for
me
and
his
jealousy
do
you
recollect
how
jealous
he
was
mr
simple
he
wore
himself
out
at
last
no
wonder
considering
what
he
had
been
accustomed
to
after
keeping
his
carriage
and
dogs
with
everybody
to
be
reduced
to
see
his
wife
go
a
it
broke
his
heart
poor
fellow
and
mr
simple
i
been
much
happier
ever
since
for
i
could
not
bear
to
see
him
fretting
lord
how
jealous
he
was
and
all
about
nothing
do
you
want
some
fresh
meat
for
the
i
a
nice
leg
of
mutton
in
the
boat
and
some
milk
for
tea
recollect
mrs
trotter
i
shall
not
overlook
your
bringing
spirits
on
board
lord
mr
simple
how
could
you
think
of
such
a
thing
it
very
true
that
these
common
people
do
it
but
the
company
i
have
kept
the
society
i
have
been
in
mr
simple
besides
you
must
recollect
that
i
never
drank
anything
but
water
i
could
not
exactly
coincide
with
her
but
i
did
not
contradict
her
would
you
like
the
portsmouth
paper
mr
simple
taking
one
out
of
her
pocket
i
know
gentlemen
are
fond
of
the
news
poor
trotter
used
never
to
stir
from
the
breakfast
table
until
he
had
finished
the
daily
paper
but
that
was
when
we
lived
in
very
different
style
have
you
any
clothes
to
wash
mr
simple
or
have
any
of
the
gentlemen
i
fear
we
have
no
time
we
sail
too
soon
replied
i
we
go
with
the
convoy
indeed
cried
mrs
trotter
who
walked
to
the
main
hatchway
and
called
to
her
man
bill
i
heard
her
give
him
directions
to
sell
nothing
upon
trust
in
consequence
of
the
intelligence
of
our
immediate
sailing
i
beg
your
pardon
mr
simple
i
was
only
desiring
my
head
man
to
send
for
your
steward
that
he
might
be
supplied
with
the
best
and
to
save
some
milk
for
the
and
i
must
beg
your
pardon
mrs
trotter
for
i
must
attend
to
my
duty
mrs
trotter
made
her
courtesy
and
walked
down
the
main
ladder
to
attend
to
and
we
separated
i
was
informed
that
she
had
a
great
deal
of
custom
as
she
understood
how
to
manage
the
officers
and
made
herself
generally
useful
to
them
she
had
been
a
bumboat
woman
for
six
years
and
had
made
a
great
deal
of
money
indeed
it
was
reported
that
if
a
lieutenant
forty
or
fifty
pounds
mrs
trotter
would
always
lend
it
to
him
without
requiring
his
promissory
note
the
captain
came
on
board
in
the
evening
having
dined
with
the
admiral
and
left
directions
for
having
all
ready
for
unmooring
and
heaving
short
at
daylight
the
signal
was
made
from
the
frigate
at
sunrise
and
before
twelve
we
were
all
under
weigh
and
running
past
st
helen
with
a
favourable
wind
our
force
consisted
of
the
frigate
the
ship
sloop
mounting
twenty
guns
the
eighteen
and
our
own
brig
the
convoy
amounted
to
nearly
two
hundred
although
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
water
smooth
we
were
more
than
a
week
before
we
made
anholt
light
owing
the
bad
sailing
and
inattention
of
many
of
the
vessels
belonging
to
the
convoy
we
were
constantly
employed
repeating
signals
firing
guns
and
often
sent
back
to
tow
up
the
sternmost
vessels
at
last
we
passed
the
anholt
light
with
a
light
breeze
and
the
next
morning
the
main
land
was
to
be
distinguished
on
both
bows
chapter
lviii
how
we
passed
the
sound
and
what
passed
in
the
sound
the
captain
overhears
again
a
conversation
between
swinburne
and
me
i
was
on
the
abaft
counting
the
convoy
when
swinburne
came
up
to
me
there
a
little
difference
between
this
part
of
the
world
and
the
west
indies
mr
simple
observed
he
black
rocks
and
fir
woods
do
remind
us
of
the
blue
mountains
of
jamaica
or
the
waving
to
the
indeed
not
swinburne
replied
i
we
shall
have
plenty
of
calms
here
without
panting
with
the
heat
although
we
may
find
the
a
little
too
warm
for
us
for
depend
upon
it
the
very
moment
the
wind
goes
down
they
will
come
out
from
every
nook
and
corner
and
annoy
us
not
a
little
have
you
been
here
before
with
a
convoy
swinburne
to
be
sure
i
have
and
it
sharp
work
that
i
seen
here
mr
simple
work
that
i
an
idea
our
captain
wo
have
much
stomach
for
swinburne
i
beg
you
will
keep
your
thoughts
relative
to
the
captain
to
yourself
recollect
the
last
time
it
is
my
duty
not
to
listen
to
them
and
i
should
rather
think
to
report
them
also
mr
simple
said
captain
hawkins
who
had
crept
up
to
us
and
overheard
our
conversation
in
this
instance
there
is
no
occasion
for
my
reporting
them
sir
replied
i
for
you
have
heard
what
has
passed
i
have
sir
replied
he
and
i
shall
not
forget
the
conversation
i
turned
forward
swinburne
had
made
his
retreat
the
moment
that
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
captain
how
many
sails
are
there
in
sight
sir
inquired
the
captain
one
hundred
and
sir
replied
i
signal
for
convoy
to
close
from
the
reported
the
midshipman
of
the
watch
we
repeated
it
and
the
captain
descended
to
his
cabin
we
were
then
running
about
four
miles
an
hour
the
water
very
smooth
and
anholt
lighthouse
hardly
visible
on
deck
bearing
about
twenty
miles
in
fact
we
were
near
the
entrance
of
the
sound
which
the
reader
may
be
aware
is
a
narrow
passage
leading
into
the
baltic
sea
we
ran
on
followed
by
the
convoy
some
of
which
were
eight
or
ten
miles
astern
of
us
and
we
were
well
into
the
sound
when
the
wind
gradually
died
away
until
it
fell
quite
calm
and
the
heads
of
the
vessels
were
laid
round
the
compass
my
watch
was
nearly
out
when
the
midshipman
who
was
looking
round
with
his
glass
on
the
copenhagen
side
reported
three
sweeping
out
from
behind
a
point
i
examined
them
and
went
down
to
report
them
to
the
captain
when
i
came
on
deck
more
were
reported
until
we
counted
ten
two
of
them
large
vessels
called
praams
the
captain
now
came
on
deck
and
i
reported
them
we
made
the
signal
of
enemy
in
sight
to
the
which
was
answered
they
divided
six
of
them
pulling
along
shore
towards
the
convoy
in
the
rear
and
four
coming
out
right
for
the
brig
the
now
made
the
signal
for
boats
manned
and
armed
to
be
held
in
readiness
we
hoisted
out
our
pinnace
and
lowered
down
our
cutters
the
other
doing
the
same
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
opened
their
fire
with
their
long
pounders
and
their
first
shot
went
right
through
the
hull
of
the
brig
just
abaft
the
fortunately
no
one
was
hurt
i
turned
round
to
look
at
the
captain
he
was
as
white
as
a
sheet
he
caught
my
eye
and
turned
aft
when
he
was
met
by
swinburne
eye
steadily
fixed
upon
him
he
then
walked
to
the
other
side
of
the
deck
another
shot
ploughed
up
the
water
close
to
us
rose
and
came
through
the
tearing
out
two
of
the
hammocks
and
throwing
them
on
the
when
the
hoisted
out
pennants
and
made
the
signal
to
send
our
pinnace
and
cutter
to
the
assistance
of
vessels
astern
the
signal
was
also
made
to
the
and
i
reported
the
signal
and
inquired
who
was
to
take
the
command
you
mr
simple
will
take
the
pinnace
and
order
mr
swinburne
into
the
cutter
mr
swinburne
sir
replied
i
the
brig
will
in
all
probability
be
in
action
soon
and
his
services
as
a
gunner
will
be
required
well
then
mr
hilton
may
go
beat
to
quarters
where
is
mr
webster
the
second
lieutenant
was
close
to
us
and
he
was
ordered
to
take
the
duty
during
my
absence
i
jumped
into
the
pinnace
and
shoved
off
ten
other
boats
from
the
and
the
other
were
pulling
in
the
same
direction
and
i
joined
them
the
had
now
opened
fire
upon
the
convoy
astern
and
were
sweeping
out
to
capture
them
dividing
themselves
into
two
parts
and
pulling
towards
different
portions
of
the
convoy
in
half
an
hour
we
were
within
gunshot
of
the
nearest
which
directed
its
fire
at
us
but
the
lieutenant
of
the
who
commanded
the
detachment
ordered
us
to
lie
on
our
oars
for
a
minute
while
he
divided
his
force
in
three
divisions
of
four
boats
each
with
instructions
that
we
should
each
oppose
a
division
of
two
by
pulling
to
the
outermost
vessel
of
the
convoy
and
securing
ourselves
as
much
as
possible
from
the
fire
by
remaining
under
her
lee
and
be
in
readiness
to
take
them
by
boarding
if
they
approached
to
capture
any
of
our
vessels
this
was
well
arranged
i
had
the
command
of
one
division
for
the
first
lieutenants
had
not
been
sent
away
from
the
and
and
having
inquired
which
of
the
divisions
of
i
was
to
oppose
i
pulled
for
them
in
the
meantime
we
observed
that
the
two
praams
and
two
which
had
remained
behind
us
and
had
been
firing
at
the
had
also
divided
one
praam
attacking
the
the
two
playing
upon
the
and
the
other
praam
engaging
the
the
latter
vessel
being
in
a
line
with
us
and
about
half
a
mile
further
out
so
that
she
could
not
return
any
effectual
fire
or
indeed
receive
much
damage
the
had
the
worst
of
it
the
fire
of
the
praam
being
chiefly
directed
to
her
at
the
distance
chosen
by
the
enemy
the
frigate
guns
reached
but
the
other
having
only
two
long
guns
were
not
able
to
return
the
fire
but
with
their
two
the
carronades
being
useless
one
of
the
praams
mounted
ten
guns
and
the
other
eight
the
last
was
opposed
to
the
and
the
fire
was
kept
up
very
smartly
particularly
by
the
and
the
enemy
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
arrived
with
my
division
close
to
the
vessel
which
was
nearest
to
the
enemy
it
was
a
large
ship
the
which
were
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
her
sweeping
to
her
as
fast
as
they
could
as
soon
as
they
perceived
our
approach
directed
their
fire
upon
us
but
without
success
except
the
last
discharge
in
which
we
being
near
enough
they
had
loaded
with
grape
the
shot
fell
a
little
short
but
one
piece
of
grape
struck
one
of
the
bowmen
of
the
pinnace
taking
off
three
fingers
of
his
right
hand
as
he
was
pulling
his
oar
before
they
could
fire
again
we
were
sheltered
by
the
vessel
pulling
close
to
her
side
hid
from
the
enemy
my
boat
was
the
only
one
in
the
division
which
carried
a
gun
and
i
now
loaded
waiting
for
the
discharge
of
the
and
then
pulling
a
little
ahead
of
the
ship
fired
at
them
and
then
returned
under
cover
to
load
this
continued
for
some
time
the
enemy
not
advancing
nearer
but
now
firing
into
the
sunderland
ship
which
protected
us
at
last
the
master
of
the
ship
looked
over
the
side
and
said
to
me
i
say
my
joker
do
you
call
this
me
assistance
i
think
i
was
better
off
before
you
came
then
i
had
only
my
share
of
the
enemy
fire
but
now
that
you
have
come
i
have
it
all
i
riddled
like
a
sieve
and
have
lost
four
men
already
suppose
you
give
me
a
spell
now
pull
behind
the
vessel
ahead
of
us
i
take
my
chance
i
thought
this
request
very
reasonable
and
as
i
should
be
really
nearer
to
the
enemy
if
i
pulled
to
the
next
vessel
and
all
ready
to
support
him
if
attacked
i
complied
with
his
wish
i
had
positive
orders
not
to
board
with
so
small
a
force
the
four
boats
containing
but
forty
men
and
each
having
at
least
seventy
unless
they
advanced
to
capture
and
then
i
was
to
run
all
risks
i
pulled
up
to
the
other
vessel
a
large
brig
and
the
captain
as
soon
as
we
came
alongside
said
i
see
what
you
about
and
i
just
leave
you
my
vessel
to
take
care
of
no
use
losing
my
men
or
being
knocked
on
the
head
all
right
you
ca
do
better
and
we
ca
do
better
either
his
boat
was
lowered
down
and
getting
in
with
his
men
he
pulled
to
another
vessel
and
lay
behind
it
all
ready
to
pull
back
if
a
breeze
sprang
up
as
was
to
be
expected
the
shifted
their
fire
to
the
deserted
vessel
which
our
boat
lay
behind
and
thus
did
the
action
in
our
quarter
continue
until
it
was
dark
the
not
choosing
to
advance
and
we
restricted
from
pulling
out
to
attack
them
there
was
no
moon
and
as
daylight
disappeared
the
effect
was
very
beautiful
in
the
distance
the
cannonading
of
the
frigate
and
other
answered
by
the
praams
and
gunboats
reinforced
by
six
more
as
we
afterwards
found
out
the
vivid
flashing
of
the
guns
reflected
by
the
water
as
smooth
as
glass
the
dark
outlines
of
the
numerous
convoy
with
their
sails
hanging
down
the
masts
one
portion
of
the
convoy
appearing
for
a
moment
as
the
guns
were
discharged
in
that
direction
and
then
disappearing
while
others
were
momentarily
seen
the
roar
of
the
heavy
guns
opposed
to
us
the
crashing
of
the
timbers
of
the
brig
which
was
struck
at
every
discharge
and
very
often
perforated
with
the
whizzing
of
the
shot
as
it
passed
by
all
this
in
a
dark
yet
clear
night
with
every
star
in
the
heavens
twinkling
and
as
it
were
looking
down
upon
us
was
interesting
as
well
as
awful
but
i
soon
perceived
that
the
were
nearing
us
every
time
that
they
fired
and
i
now
discharged
grape
alone
waiting
for
the
flash
of
the
fire
to
ascertain
their
direction
at
last
i
could
perceive
their
long
low
hulls
not
two
cables
length
from
us
and
their
sweeps
lifting
from
the
water
it
was
plain
that
they
were
advancing
to
board
and
i
resolved
to
anticipate
them
if
possible
i
had
fired
ahead
of
the
brig
and
i
now
pulled
with
all
my
boats
astern
giving
my
orders
to
the
officers
and
laying
on
our
oars
in
readiness
the
were
about
half
a
length
from
each
other
pulling
up
abreast
and
passing
us
at
about
the
same
distance
when
i
directed
the
men
to
give
way
i
had
determined
to
throw
all
my
force
upon
the
nearest
boat
and
in
half
a
minute
our
bows
were
forced
between
their
sweeps
which
we
caught
hold
of
to
force
our
way
alongside
the
resistance
of
the
danes
was
very
determined
three
times
did
i
obtain
a
footing
on
the
deck
and
three
times
was
i
thrown
back
into
the
boats
at
last
we
had
fairly
obtained
our
ground
and
were
driving
them
gradually
forward
when
as
i
ran
on
the
gunwale
to
obtain
a
position
more
in
advance
of
my
men
i
received
a
blow
with
the
butt
end
of
a
musket
i
believe
on
the
shoulder
which
knocked
me
overboard
and
i
fell
between
the
sweeps
and
sunk
under
the
vessel
bottom
i
rose
under
her
stern
but
i
was
so
shook
with
the
violence
of
the
blow
that
i
was
for
some
time
confused
still
i
had
strength
to
keep
myself
above
water
and
paddled
as
it
appeared
away
from
the
vessel
until
i
hit
against
a
sweep
which
had
fallen
overboard
this
supported
me
and
i
gradually
recovered
myself
the
loud
report
of
a
gun
close
to
me
startled
me
and
i
perceived
that
it
was
from
the
which
i
had
boarded
and
that
her
head
was
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
other
from
this
with
the
noise
of
the
sweeps
pulling
i
knew
that
my
men
had
succeeded
in
capturing
her
i
hallooed
but
they
did
not
hear
me
and
i
soon
lost
sight
of
her
another
gun
was
now
fired
it
was
from
the
other
retreating
and
i
perceived
her
pulling
for
she
passed
me
not
twenty
yards
off
i
now
held
the
sweep
with
my
hands
and
struck
out
off
the
shore
in
the
direction
of
the
convoy
a
light
breeze
rippled
the
water
and
i
knew
that
i
had
no
time
to
lose
in
about
five
minutes
i
heard
the
sound
of
oars
and
perceived
a
boat
crossing
me
i
hailed
as
loud
as
i
could
they
heard
me
laid
on
their
oars
and
i
hailed
again
they
pulled
to
me
and
took
me
in
it
was
the
master
of
the
brig
who
aware
of
the
capture
of
one
and
the
retreat
of
the
other
was
looking
for
his
vessel
or
as
he
told
me
for
what
was
left
of
her
in
a
short
time
we
found
her
and
although
very
much
cut
up
she
had
received
no
shot
under
water
in
an
hour
the
breeze
was
strong
the
cannonading
had
ceased
in
every
direction
and
we
had
repaired
her
damages
so
as
to
be
able
to
make
sail
and
continue
our
course
through
the
sound
here
i
may
as
well
relate
the
events
of
the
action
one
of
the
other
divisions
of
had
retreated
when
attacked
by
the
boats
the
other
had
beaten
off
the
boats
and
killed
many
of
the
men
but
had
suffered
so
much
themselves
as
to
retreat
without
making
any
capture
the
lost
four
men
killed
and
seven
wounded
the
three
men
wounded
the
had
nobody
hurt
the
had
six
men
killed
and
two
wounded
including
the
captain
but
of
that
i
shall
speak
hereafter
i
found
that
i
was
by
no
means
seriously
hurt
by
the
blow
i
had
received
my
shoulder
was
stiff
for
a
week
and
very
much
discoloured
but
nothing
more
when
i
fell
overboard
i
had
struck
against
a
sweep
which
had
cut
my
ear
half
off
the
captain
of
the
brig
gave
me
dry
clothes
and
in
a
few
hours
i
was
very
comfortably
asleep
hoping
to
join
my
ship
the
next
day
but
in
this
i
was
disappointed
the
breeze
was
favourable
and
fresh
and
we
were
clear
of
the
sound
but
a
long
way
astern
of
the
convoy
and
none
of
the
headmost
to
be
seen
i
dressed
and
went
on
deck
and
immediately
perceived
that
i
had
little
chance
of
joining
my
ship
until
we
arrived
at
carlscrona
which
proved
to
be
the
case
about
ten
the
wind
died
away
and
we
had
from
that
time
such
baffling
light
winds
that
it
was
six
days
before
we
dropped
our
anchor
every

sternly
refused
to
be
admitted
for
the

of
the

as
soon
as
the
sails
were
furled
i
thanked
the
master
of
the
vessel
for
his
kindness
and
requested
the
boat
he
ordered
it
to
be
manned
saying
how
glad
your
captain
will
be
to
see
you
i
doubted
that
we
shook
hands
and
i
pulled
to
the
which
lay
about
two
cables
length
astern
of
us
i
had
put
on
a
jacket
when
i
left
the
brig
on
service
and
coming
in
a
merchantman
boat
no
attention
was
paid
to
me
indeed
owing
to
circumstances
no
one
was
on
the
and
i
ascended
the
side
unperceived
the
men
and
officers
were
on
the
attending
the
sale
of
dead
men
effects
before
the
mast
and
every
eye
was
fixed
upon
six
pair
of
nankeen
trousers
exposed
by
the
purser
steward
which
i
recognized
as
my
own
nine
shillings
for
six
pair
of
nankeen
trousers
cried
the
purser
steward
come
my
men
they
worth
more
than
that
observed
the
captain
who
appeared
to
be
very
facetious
it
better
to
be
in
his
trousers
than
in
his
shoes
this
brutal
remark
created
a
silence
for
a
moment
well
then
steward
let
them
go
one
would
think
that
pulling
on
his
trousers
would
make
you
as
afraid
as
he
was
continued
the
captain
laughing
shame
was
cried
out
by
one
or
two
of
the
officers
and
i
recognised
swinburne
voice
as
one
more
likely
if
they
put
on
yours
cried
i
in
a
loud
indignant
tone
everybody
started
and
turned
round
captain
hawkins
staggered
to
a
carronade
i
beg
to
report
myself
as
having
rejoined
my
ship
sir
continued
i
hurrah
my
lads
three
cheers
for
mr
simple
said
swinburne
the
men
gave
them
with
emphasis
the
captain
looked
at
me
and
without
saying
a
word
hastily
retreated
to
his
cabin
i
perceived
as
he
went
down
that
he
had
his
arm
in
a
sling
i
thanked
the
men
for
their
kind
feeling
towards
me
shook
hands
with
thompson
and
webster
who
warmly
congratulated
me
and
then
with
old
swinburne
who
nearly
wrung
my
arm
off
and
gave
my
shoulder
such
pain
as
to
make
me
cry
out
and
with
the
others
who
extended
theirs
i
desired
the
sale
of
my
effects
to
be
stopped
fortunately
for
me
it
had
but
just
begun
and
the
articles
were
all
returned
thompson
had
informed
the
captain
that
he
knew
my
father
address
and
would
take
charge
of
my
clothes
and
send
them
home
but
the
captain
would
not
allow
him
in
a
few
minutes
i
received
a
letter
from
the
captain
desiring
me
to
acquaint
him
in
writing
for
the
information
of
the
senior
officer
in
what
manner
i
had
escaped
i
went
down
below
when
i
found
one
very
melancholy
face
that
of
the
passed
midshipman
of
the
who
had
received
an
acting
order
in
my
place
when
i
went
to
my
desk
i
found
two
important
articles
missing
one
my
private
and
the
other
the
journal
which
i
kept
of
what
passed
and
from
which
this
narrative
has
been
compiled
i
inquired
of
my
messmates
who
stated
that
the
desk
had
not
been
looked
into
by
any
one
but
the
captain
who
of
course
must
have
possessed
himself
of
those
important
documents
i
wrote
a
letter
containing
a
short
narrative
of
what
had
happened
and
at
the
same
time
another
on
service
to
the
captain
requesting
that
he
would
deliver
up
my
property
the
private
journal
and
in
his
possession
the
captain
as
soon
as
he
received
my
letters
sent
up
word
for
his
boat
to
be
manned
as
soon
as
it
was
manned
i
reported
it
and
then
begged
to
know
whether
he
intended
to
comply
with
my
request
he
answered
that
he
should
not
and
then
went
on
deck
and
quitted
the
brig
to
pull
on
board
of
the
senior
officer
i
therefore
determined
immediately
to
write
to
the
captain
of
the
acquainting
him
with
the
conduct
of
captain
hawkins
and
requesting
his
interference
this
i
did
immediately
and
the
boat
that
had
brought
me
on
board
not
having
left
the
brig
i
sent
the
letter
by
it
requesting
them
to
put
it
into
the
hands
of
one
of
the
officers
the
letter
was
received
previous
to
captain
hawkins
visit
being
over
and
the
captain
of
the
put
it
into
his
hands
inquiring
if
the
statement
were
correct
captain
hawkins
replied
that
it
was
true
that
he
had
detained
these
papers
as
there
was
so
much
mutiny
and
disaffection
in
them
and
that
he
should
not
return
them
to
me
that
i
can
not
permit
replied
the
captain
of
the
who
was
aware
of
the
character
of
captain
hawkins
if
by
mistake
you
have
been
put
in
possession
of
any
of
mr
simple
secrets
you
are
bound
in
honour
not
to
make
use
of
them
neither
can
you
retain
property
not
your
own
but
captain
hawkins
was
determined
and
refused
to
give
them
to
me
well
then
captain
hawkins
replied
the
captain
of
the
you
will
oblige
me
by
remaining
on
my
till
i
come
out
of
the
cabin
the
captain
of
the
then
wrote
an
order
directing
captain
hawkins
immediately
to
deliver
up
the
papers
of
mine
in
his
possession
and
coming
out
of
the
cabin
put
it
into
captain
hands
saying
now
sir
here
is
a
written
order
from
your
superior
officer
disobey
it
if
you
dare
if
you
do
i
will
put
you
under
arrest
and
try
you
by
a
i
can
only
regret
that
any
captain
in
his
majesty
service
should
be
forced
in
this
way
to
do
his
duty
as
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
captain
hawkins
bit
his
lip
at
the
order
and
the
cutting
remarks
accompanying
it
your
boat
is
manned
sir
said
the
captain
of
the
in
a
severe
tone
captain
hawkins
came
on
board
sealed
up
the
books
and
sent
them
to
the
captain
of
the
who
them
to
me
on
his
majesty
service
and
returned
them
by
the
same
boat
the
public
may
therefore
thank
the
captain
of
the
for
the
memoirs
which
they
are
now
reading
from
my
messmates
i
gained
the
following
intelligence
of
what
had
passed
after
i
had
quitted
the
brig
the
fire
of
the
praam
had
cut
them
up
severely
and
captain
hawkins
had
been
struck
in
the
arm
with
a
piece
of
the
which
had
been
shot
away
shortly
after
i
left
although
the
skin
only
was
razed
he
thought
proper
to
consider
himself
badly
wounded
and
giving
up
the
command
to
mr
webster
the
second
lieutenant
had
retreated
below
where
he
remained
until
the
action
was
over
when
mr
webster
reported
the
return
of
the
boats
with
the
capture
of
the
and
my
supposed
death
he
was
so
delighted
that
he
quite
forgot
his
wound
and
ran
on
deck
rubbing
his
hands
as
he
walked
up
and
down
at
last
he
recollected
himself
went
down
into
his
cabin
and
came
up
again
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
the
next
morning
he
went
on
board
of
the
and
made
his
report
to
the
senior
officer
bringing
back
with
him
the
disappointed
as
my
successor
he
had
also
stated
on
the
that
if
i
had
not
been
killed
he
intended
to
have
tried
me
by
a
and
have
turned
me
out
of
the
service
that
he
had
quite
enough
charges
to
ruin
me
for
he
had
been
collecting
them
ever
since
i
had
been
under
his
command
and
that
now
he
would
make
that
old
scoundrel
of
a
gunner
repent
his
intimacy
with
me
all
this
was
confided
to
the
surgeon
who
as
i
before
observed
was
very
much
of
a
courtier
but
the
surgeon
had
repeated
it
to
thompson
the
master
who
now
gave
me
the
information
there
was
one
advantage
in
all
this
which
was
that
i
knew
exactly
the
position
in
which
i
stood
and
what
i
had
to
expect
during
the
short
time
that
we
remained
in
port
i
took
care
that
should
not
be
allowed
to
come
alongside
and
the
men
were
all
sober
we
received
orders
from
the
captain
of
the
to
join
the
admiral
who
was
off
the
texel
in
pursuance
of
directions
he
had
received
from
the
admiralty
to
despatch
one
of
the
squadron
and
we
were
selected
from
the
dislike
which
he
had
taken
to
captain
hawkins

a

sight
we
made
the

she
hoisted
swedish

and
kept
away
a

of
points

close

us
we
were
within

miles
of
her
when
she
up
courses
and
took
in
her
topgallant
sails
as
we
closed
to
within
two
cables
lengths
she
we
did
the

and
the
captain
desired
me
to
lower
down
the
boat
and
board
her
ask
her
name
by
whom
she
was
commanded
and
offer
any
assistance
if
the
captain
required
it
this
was
the
usual
custom
of
the
service
and
i
went
on
board
in
obedience
to
my
orders
when
i
arrived
on
the
i
asked
in
french
whether
there
was
any
one
who
spoke
it
the
first
lieutenant
came
forward
and
took
off
his
hat
i
stated
that
i
was
requested
to
ask
the
name
of
the
vessel
and
the
commanding
officer
to
insert
it
in
our
log
and
to
offer
any
service
that
we
could
command
he
replied
that
the
captain
was
on
deck
and
turned
round
but
the
captain
had
gone
down
below
i
will
inform
him
of
your
message
i
had
no
idea
that
he
had
quitted
the
deck
and
the
first
lieutenant
left
me
i
exchanged
a
few
compliments
and
a
little
news
with
the
officers
on
deck
who
appeared
to
be
very
gentlemanlike
fellows
when
the
first
lieutenant
requested
my
presence
in
the
cabin
i
descended
the
door
was
opened
i
was
announced
by
the
first
lieutenant
and
he
quitted
the
cabin
i
looked
at
the
captain
who
was
sitting
at
the
table
he
was
a
fine
stout
man
with
two
or
three
ribands
at
his
and
a
large
pair
of
moustachios
i
thought
that
i
had
seen
him
before
but
i
could
not
recollect
when
his
face
was
certainly
familiar
to
me
but
as
i
had
been
informed
by
the
officers
on
deck
that
the
captain
was
a
count
shucksen
a
person
i
had
never
heard
of
i
thought
that
i
must
be
mistaken
i
therefore
addressed
him
in
french
paying
him
a
long
compliment
with
all
the
necessary
the
captain
turned
round
to
me
took
his
hand
away
from
his
forehead
which
it
had
shaded
and
looking
me
full
in
the
face
replied
mr
simple
i
do
understand
but

little

spin
your
yarn

are

old
friend
chucks
the
boatswain
whom
you
now
see
i
knew
you
as
soon
as
you
came
up
the
side
and
i
was
afraid
that
you
would
immediately
recognize
me
and
i
slipped
down
into
the
cabin
for
which
apparent
rudeness
allow
me
to
apologise
that
you
might
not
explain
before
the
officers
we
shook
hands
heartily
and
then
he
requested
me
to
sit
down
but
said
i
they
told
me
on
deck
that
the
frigate
was
commanded
by
a
count
shucksen
that
is
my
present
rank
my
dear
peter
said
he
but
as
you
have
no
time
to
lose
i
will
explain
all
i
know
i
can
trust
to
your
honour
you
remember
that
you
left
me
as
you
and
i
supposed
dying
in
the
privateer
with
the
captain
jacket
and
epaulettes
on
my
shoulders
when
the
boats
came
out
and
you
left
the
vessel
they
boarded
and
found
me
i
was
still
breathing
and
judging
of
my
rank
by
the
coat
they
put
me
into
the
boat
and
pushed
on
shore
the
privateer
sank
very
shortly
after
i
was
not
expected
to
live
but
in
a
few
days
a
change
took
place
and
i
was
better
they
asked
me
my
name
and
i
gave
my
own
which
they
lengthened
into
shucksen
somehow
or
another
i
recovered
by
a
miracle
and
am
now
as
well
as
ever
i
was
in
my
life
they
were
not
a
little
proud
of
having
captured
a
captain
in
the
british
service
as
they
supposed
for
they
never
questioned
me
as
to
my
real
rank
after
some
weeks
i
was
sent
home
to
denmark
in
a
running
vessel
but
it
so
happened
that
we
met
with
a
gale
and
were
wrecked
on
the
swedish
coast
close
to
carlscrona
the
danes
were
at
that
time
at
war
having
joined
the
russians
and
they
were
made
prisoners
while
i
was
of
course
liberated
and
treated
with
great
distinction
but
as
i
could
not
speak
either
french
or
their
own
language
i
could
not
get
on
very
well
however
i
had
a
handsome
allowance
and
permission
to
go
to
england
as
soon
as
i
pleased
the
swedes
were
then
at
war
with
the
russians
and
were
fitting
out
their
fleet
but
lord
bless
them
they
did
know
much
about
it
i
amused
myself
walking
in
the
dockyard
and
looking
at
their
motions
but
they
had
not
thirty
men
in
the
fleet
who
knew
what
they
were
about
and
as
for
a
man
to
set
them
going
there
was
one
well
peter
you
know
i
could
not
be
idle
and
so
by
degrees
i
told
one
and
then
told
another
until
they
went
the
right
way
to
work
and
the
captains
and
officers
were
very
much
obliged
to
me
at
last
they
all
came
to
me
and
if
they
did
not
understand
me
entirely
i
showed
them
how
to
do
it
with
my
own
hands
and
the
fleet
began
to
make
a
show
with
their
rigging
the
admiral
who
commanded
was
very
much
obliged
and
i
seemed
to
come
as
regularly
to
my
work
as
if
i
was
paid
for
it
at
last
the
admiral
came
with
an
english
interpreter
and
asked
me
whether
i
was
anxious
to
go
back
to
england
or
would
i
like
to
join
their
service
i
saw
what
they
wanted
and
i
replied
that
i
had
neither
wife
nor
child
in
england
and
that
i
liked
their
country
very
much
but
i
must
take
time
to
consider
of
it
and
must
also
know
what
they
had
to
propose
i
went
home
to
my
lodgings
and
to
make
them
more
anxious
i
did
not
make
my
appearance
at
the
dockyard
for
three
or
four
days
when
a
letter
came
from
the
admiral
offering
me
the
command
of
a
frigate
if
i
would
join
their
service
i
replied
for
i
knew
how
much
they
wanted
me
that
i
would
prefer
an
english
frigate
to
a
swedish
one
and
that
i
would
not
consent
unless
they
offered
something
more
and
then
with
the
express
stipulation
that
i
should
not
take
arms
against
my
own
country
they
then
waited
for
a
week
when
they
offered
to
make
me
a
and
give
me
the
command
of
a
frigate
this
suited
me
as
you
may
suppose
peter
it
was
the
darling
wish
of
my
heart
i
was
to
be
made
a
gentleman
i
consented
and
was
made
count
shucksen
and
had
a
fine
large
frigate
under
my
command
i
then
set
to
work
with
a
will
superintended
the
fitting
out
of
the
whole
fleet
and
showed
them
what
an
englishman
could
do
we
sailed
and
you
of
course
know
the
brush
we
had
with
the
russians
which
i
must
say
did
us
no
discredit
i
was
fortunate
to
distinguish
myself
for
i
exchanged
several
broadsides
with
a
russian
ship
and
came
off
with
honour
when
we
went
into
port
i
got
this
riband
i
was
out
afterwards
and
fell
in
with
a
russian
frigate
and
captured
her
for
which
i
received
this
other
riband
since
that
i
have
been
in
high
favour
and
now
that
i
speak
the
languages
i
like
the
people
very
much
i
am
often
at
court
when
i
am
in
harbour
and
peter
i
am
i
wish
you
joy
count
with
all
my
heart
yes
and
well
married
too
to
a
swedish
countess
of
very
high
family
and
i
expect
that
i
have
a
little
boy
or
girl
by
this
time
so
you
observe
peter
that
i
am
at
last
a
gentleman
and
what
is
more
my
children
will
be
noble
by
two
descents
who
would
have
thought
that
this
would
have
been
occasioned
by
my
throwing
the
captain
jacket
into
the
boat
instead
of
my
own
and
now
my
dear
mr
simple
that
i
have
made
you
my
confidant
i
need
not
say
do
not
say
a
word
about
it
to
anybody
they
certainly
could
not
do
me
much
harm
but
still
they
might
do
me
some
and
although
i
am
not
likely
to
meet
any
one
who
may
recognize
me
in
this
uniform
and
these
moustachios
it
just
as
well
to
keep
the
secret
which
to
you
and
only
would
i
have
confided
my
dear
count
replied
i
your
secret
is
safe
with
me
you
have
come
to
your
title
before
me
at
all
events
and
i
sincerely
wish
you
joy
for
you
have
obtained
it
honourably
but
although
i
would
like
to
talk
with
you
for
days
i
must
return
on
board
for
i
am
now
sailing
with
a
very
unpleasant
captain
i
then
in
a
few
words
stated
where
was
and
when
we
parted
i
went
with
him
on
deck
count
shucksen
taking
my
arm
and
introducing
me
as
an
old
shipmate
to
his
officers
i
hope
we
may
meet
again
said
i
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
little
chance
who
knows
replied
he
see
what
chance
has
done
for
me
my
dear
peter
god
bless
you
you
are
one
of
the
very
few
whom
i
always
loved
god
bless
you
my
boy
and
never
forget
that
all
i
have
is
at
your
command
if
you
come
my
way
i
thanked
him
and
saluting
the
officers
went
down
the
side
as
i
expected
when
i
came
on
board
the
captain
demanded
in
an
angry
tone
why
i
had
stayed
so
long
i
replied
that
i
was
shown
down
into
count
shucksen
cabin
and
he
conversed
so
long
that
i
could
not
get
away
sooner
as
it
would
not
have
been
polite
to
have
left
him
before
he
had
finished
his
questions
i
then
gave
a
very
civil
message
and
the
captain
said
no
more
the
very
name
of
a
great
man
always
silenced
him
chapter
lxi
bad
news
from
home
and
worse
on
board
notwithstanding
his
previous
trials
peter
forced
to
prepare
for
another
mrs
trotter
again
improves
as
she
grows
old
captain
hawkins
and
his
twelve
charges
no
other
event
of
consequence
occurred
until
we
joined
the
admiral
who
only
detained
us
three
hours
with
the
fleet
and
then
sent
us
home
with
his
despatches
we
arrived
after
a
quiet
passage
at
portsmouth
where
i
wrote
immediately
to
my
sister
ellen
requesting
to
know
the
state
of
my
father
health
i
waited
impatiently
for
an
answer
and
by
return
of
post
received
one
with
a
black
seal
my
father
had
died
the
day
before
from
a
brain
fever
and
ellen
conjured
me
to
obtain
leave
of
absence
to
come
to
her
in
her
state
of
distress
the
captain
came
on
board
the
next
morning
and
i
had
a
letter
ready
written
on
service
to
the
admiral
stating
the
circumstances
and
requesting
leave
of
absence
i
presented
it
to
him
and
entreated
him
to
forward
it
at
any
other
time
i
would
not
have
condescended
but
the
thoughts
of
my
poor
sister
unprotected
and
alone
with
my
father
lying
dead
in
the
house
made
me
humble
and
submissive
captain
hawkins
read
the
letter
and
very
coolly
replied
that
it
was
very
easy
to
say
that
my
father
was
dead
but
he
required
proofs
even
this
insult
did
not
affect
me
i
put
my
sister
letter
into
his
hand
he
read
it
and
as
he
returned
it
to
me
he
smiled
maliciously
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
forward
your
letter
mr
simple
as
i
have
one
to
deliver
to
you
he
put
a
large
folio
packet
into
my
hand
and
went
below
i
opened
it
it
was
a
copy
of
a
letter
demanding
a
upon
me
with
a
long
list
of
the
charges
preferred
by
him
i
was
stupefied
not
so
much
at
his
asking
for
a
but
at
the
conviction
of
the
impossibility
of
my
now
being
able
to
go
to
the
assistance
of
my
poor
sister
i
went
down
into
the
gunroom
and
threw
myself
on
a
chair
at
the
same
time
tossing
the
letter
to
thompson
the
master
he
read
it
over
carefully
and
folded
it
up
upon
my
word
simple
i
do
not
see
that
you
have
much
to
fear
these
charges
are
very
frivolous
no
no
that
i
care
little
about
but
it
is
my
poor
sister
i
had
written
for
leave
of
absence
and
now
she
is
left
god
knows
how
long
in
such
distressing
circumstances
thompson
looked
grave
i
had
forgotten
your
father
death
simple
it
is
indeed
cruel
i
would
offer
to
go
myself
but
you
will
want
my
evidence
at
the
it
ca
be
helped
write
to
your
sister
and
keep
up
her
spirits
tell
her
why
you
can
not
come
and
that
it
will
all
end
well
i
did
so
and
went
early
to
bed
for
i
was
really
ill
the
next
morning
the
official
letter
from
the
came
off
acquainting
me
that
a
had
been
ordered
upon
me
and
that
it
would
take
place
that
day
week
i
immediately
resigned
the
command
to
the
second
lieutenant
and
commenced
an
examination
into
the
charges
preferred
they
were
very
numerous
and
dated
back
almost
to
the
very
day
that
he
had
joined
the
ship
there
were
twelve
in
all
i
shall
not
trouble
the
reader
with
the
whole
of
them
as
many
were
very
frivolous
the
principal
charges
were
for
mutinous
and
disrespectful
conduct
to
captain
hawkins
on
such
a
date
having
in
a
conversation
with
an
inferior
officer
on
the
stated
that
captain
hawkins
was
a
spy
and
had
spies
in
the
ship
for
neglect
of
duty
in
disobeying
the
orders
of
captain
hawkins
on
the
night
of
the
of
for
having
on
the
of
sent
away
two
boats
from
the
ship
in
direct
opposition
to
the
orders
of
captain
hawkins
for
having
again
on
the
morning
of
the
of
held
mutinous
and
disrespectful
conversation
relative
to
captain
hawkins
with
the
gunner
of
the
ship
allowing
the
latter
to
accuse
captain
hawkins
of
cowardice
without
reporting
the
same
for
insulting
expressions
on
the
to
captain
hawkins
on
his
rejoining
the
brig
on
the
morning
of
the
of
for
not
causing
the
orders
of
captain
hawkins
to
be
put
in
force
on
several
occasions
and
further
as
captain
hawkins
testimony
was
necessary
in
two
of
the
charges
the
king
on
charges
the
prosecutor
although
most
of
these
charges
were
frivolous
yet
i
at
once
perceived
my
danger
some
were
dated
back
many
months
to
the
time
before
our
ship
company
had
been
changed
and
i
could
not
find
the
necessary
witnesses
indeed
in
all
but
the
recent
charges
not
expecting
to
be
called
to
a
i
had
serious
difficulties
to
contend
with
but
the
most
serious
was
the
first
charge
which
i
knew
not
how
to
get
over
swinburne
had
most
decidedly
referred
to
the
captain
when
he
talked
of
spy
captains
however
with
the
assistance
of
thompson
i
made
the
best
defence
i
could
ready
for
my
trial
two
days
before
my
i
received
a
letter
from
ellen
who
appeared
in
a
state
of
distraction
from
this
accumulation
of
misfortune
she
told
me
that
my
father
was
to
be
buried
the
next
day
and
that
the
new
rector
had
written
to
her
to
know
when
it
would
be
convenient
for
the
vicarage
to
be
given
up
that
my
father
bills
had
been
sent
in
and
amounted
to
twelve
hundred
pounds
already
and
that
she
knew
not
the
extent
of
the
whole
claims
there
appeared
to
be
nothing
left
but
the
furniture
of
the
house
and
she
wanted
to
know
whether
the
debts
were
to
be
paid
with
the
money
i
had
left
in
the
funds
for
her
use
i
wrote
immediately
requesting
her
to
liquidate
every
claim
as
far
as
my
money
went
sending
her
an
order
upon
my
agent
to
draw
for
the
whole
amount
and
a
power
of
attorney
to
him
to
sell
out
the
stock
i
had
just
sealed
the
letter
when
mrs
trotter
who
had
attended
the
ship
since
our
return
to
portsmouth
begged
to
speak
with
me
and
walked
in
after
her
message
without
waiting
for
an
answer
my
dear
mr
simple
said
she
i
know
all
that
is
going
on
and
i
find
that
you
have
no
lawyer
to
assist
you
now
i
know
that
it
is
necessary
and
will
very
probably
be
of
great
service
in
your
defence
for
when
people
are
in
distress
and
anxiety
they
have
not
their
wits
about
them
so
i
have
brought
a
friend
of
mine
from
portsea
a
very
clever
man
who
for
my
sake
will
undertake
your
cause
and
i
hope
you
will
not
refuse
him
you
recollect
giving
me
a
dozen
pair
of
stockings
i
did
not
refuse
them
nor
shall
you
refuse
me
now
i
always
said
to
mr
trotter
to
a
lawyer
and
if
he
had
taken
my
advice
he
would
have
done
well
i
recollect
when
a
smashed
the
panel
of
our
carriage
says
i
to
a
lawyer
and
he
very
politely
answered
to
the
devil
but
what
was
the
consequence
he
dead
and
bumming
now
mr
simple
will
you
oblige
me
it
all
free
gratis
for
nothing
not
for
nothing
for
it
for
my
sake
you
see
mr
simple
i
have
admirers
yet
concluded
she
smiling
mrs
trotter
advice
was
good
and
although
i
would
not
listen
to
receiving
his
services
gratuitously
i
agreed
to
employ
him
and
very
useful
did
he
prove
against
such
charges
and
such
a
man
as
captain
hawkins
he
came
on
board
that
afternoon
carefully
examined
into
all
the
documents
and
the
witnesses
whom
i
could
bring
forward
showed
me
the
weak
side
of
my
defence
and
took
the
papers
on
shore
with
him
every
day
he
came
on
board
to
collect
fresh
evidence
and
examine
into
my
case
at
last
the
day
arrived
i
dressed
myself
in
my
best
uniform
the
gun
fired
from
the
admiral
ship
with
the
signal
for
a
at
nine
and
i
went
on
board
in
a
boat
with
all
the
witnesses
on
my
arrival
i
was
put
under
the
custody
of
the
the
captains
ordered
to
attend
pulled
alongside
one
after
another
and
were
received
by
a
party
of
marines
presenting
their
arms
at
nine
the
court
was
all
assembled
and
i
was
ushered
in
are
open
courts
although
no
one
is
permitted
to
print
the
evidence
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
was
the
admiral
as
president
on
his
right
hand
standing
was
captain
hawkins
as
prosecutor
on
each
side
of
the
table
were
six
captains
sitting
near
to
the
admiral
according
to
their
seniority
at
the
bottom
facing
the
admiral
was
the
on
whose
left
hand
i
stood
as
prisoner
the
witnesses
called
in
to
be
examined
were
stationed
on
his
right
and
behind
him
by
the
indulgence
of
the
court
was
a
small
table
at
which
sat
my
legal
adviser
so
close
as
to
be
able
to
communicate
with
me
the
court
were
all
sworn
and
then
took
their
seats
stauncheons
with
ropes
covered
with
green
baize
passed
along
were
behind
the
chairs
of
the
captains
who
composed
the
court
so
that
they
might
not
be
crowded
upon
by
those
who
came
in
to
listen
to
what
passed
the
charges
were
then
read
as
well
as
the
letters
to
and
from
the
admiral
by
which
the
was
demanded
and
granted
and
then
captain
hawkins
was
desired
to
open
his
prosecution
he
commenced
with
observing
his
great
regret
that
he
had
been
forced
to
a
measure
so
repugnant
to
his
feelings
his
frequent
cautions
to
me
and
the
indifference
with
which
i
treated
them
and
after
a
preamble
composed
of
every
falsity
that
could
be
devised
he
commenced
with
the
first
charge
and
stating
himself
to
be
the
witness
gave
his
evidence
when
it
was
finished
i
was
asked
if
i
had
any
questions
to
put
by
the
advice
of
my
lawyer
i
replied
no
the
president
then
asked
the
captains
composing
the
commencing
according
to
their
seniority
whether
they
wished
to
ask
any
questions
i
wish
said
the
second
captain
who
was
addressed
to
ask
captain
hawkins
whether
when
he
came
on
deck
he
came
up
in
the
usual
way
in
which
a
captain
of
a
comes
on
his
or
whether
he
slipped
up
without
noise
captain
hawkins
declared
that
he
came
up
as
he
this
was
true
enough
for
he
invariably
came
up
by
stealth
pray
captain
hawkins
as
you
have
repeated
a
good
deal
of
conversation
which
passed
between
the
first
lieutenant
and
the
gunner
may
i
ask
you
how
long
you
were
by
their
side
without
their
perceiving
you
a
very
short
time
was
the
answer
but
captain
hawkins
do
you
not
think
allowing
that
you
came
up
on
deck
in
your
way
as
you
term
it
that
you
would
have
done
better
to
have
hemmed
or
hawed
so
as
to
let
your
officers
know
that
you
were
present
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
hear
all
that
might
be
said
of
me
in
my
supposed
absence
to
this
observation
captain
hawkins
replied
that
he
was
so
astonished
at
the
conversation
that
he
was
quite
breathless
having
till
then
had
the
highest
opinion
of
me
no
more
questions
were
asked
and
they
proceeded
to
the
second
charge
this
was
a
very
trifling
one
for
lighting
a
stove
contrary
to
orders
the
evidence
brought
forward
was
the
sergeant
of
marines
when
his
evidence
in
favour
of
the
charge
had
been
given
i
was
asked
by
the
president
if
i
had
any
questions
to
put
to
the
witness
i
put
the
following
did
you
repeat
to
captain
hawkins
that
i
had
ordered
the
stove
to
be
lighted
i
did
are
you
not
in
the
custom
of
reporting
direct
to
the
captain
any
negligence
or
disobedience
of
orders
you
may
witness
in
the
ship
i
am
did
you
ever
report
anything
of
the
sort
to
me
as
first
lieutenant
or
do
you
always
report
direct
to
the
captain
i
always
report
direct
to
the
captain
by
the
captain
orders
yes
the
following
questions
were
then
put
by
some
of
the
members
of
the
court
you
have
served
in
other
ships
before
yes
did
you
ever
sailing
with
other
captains
receive
an
order
from
them
to
report
direct
to
them
and
not
through
the
first
lieutenant
the
witness
here
prevaricated
answer
directly
yes
or
no
the
third
charge
was
then
brought
forward
for
sending
away
boats
contrary
to
express
orders
this
was
substantiated
by
captain
own
evidence
the
order
having
been
verbal
by
the
advice
of
my
counsel
i
put
no
questions
to
captain
hawkins
neither
did
the
court
the
fourth
charge
that
of
holding
mutinous
conversation
with
the
gunner
and
allowing
him
to
accuse
the
captain
of
unwillingness
to
engage
the
enemy
was
then
again
substantiated
by
captain
hawkins
as
the
only
witness
i
again
left
my
reply
for
my
defence
and
only
one
question
was
put
by
one
of
the
members
which
was
to
inquire
of
captain
hawkins
as
he
appeared
peculiarly
unfortunate
in
overhearing
conversations
whether
he
walked
up
as
usual
to
the
taffrail
or
whether
he
captain
hawkins
gave
the
same
answer
as
before
the
fifth
charge
for
insulting
expressions
to
captain
hawkins
on
my
rejoining
the
brig
at
carlscrona
was
then
brought
forward
and
the
sergeant
of
marines
and
one
of
the
seamen
appeared
as
witnesses
this
charge
excited
a
great
deal
of
amusement
in
the
by
the
members
of
the
court
captain
hawkins
was
asked
what
he
meant
by
the
expression
when
disposing
of
the
clothes
of
an
officer
who
was
killed
in
action
that
the
men
appeared
to
think
that
his
trousers
would
instil
fear
nothing
more
upon
my
honour
sir
replied
captain
hawkins
than
an
implication
that
they
were
alarmed
lest
they
should
be
haunted
by
his
ghost
then
of
course
mr
simple
meant
the
same
in
his
reply
observed
the
captain
sarcastically
the
remainder
of
the
charges
were
then
brought
forward
but
they
were
of
little
consequence
the
witnesses
were
chiefly
the
sergeant
of
marines
and
the
of
captain
hawkins
who
had
been
watching
me
from
the
shore
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
they
were
all
gone
through
and
the
president
then
adjourned
the
court
that
i
might
bring
forward
my
own
witnesses
in
my
defence
on
the
following
day
and
i
returned
on
board
the
chapter
lxii
a
good
defence
not
always
good
against
a
bad
accusation
peter
wins
the
heart
of
his
judges
yet
loses
his
cause
and
is
dismissed
his
ship
the
next
day
i
commenced
my
defence
and
i
preferred
calling
my
own
witnesses
first
and
by
the
advice
of
my
counsel
and
at
the
request
of
swinburne
i
called
him
i
put
the
following
questions
when
we
were
talking
on
the
was
it
fine
weather
yes
it
was
do
you
think
that
you
might
have
heard
any
one
coming
on
deck
in
the
usual
way
up
the
companion
ladder
sure
of
it
do
you
mean
then
to
imply
that
captain
hawkins
came
up
stealthily
i
have
an
idea
he
pounced
upon
us
as
a
cat
does
on
a
mouse
what
were
the
expressions
made
use
of
i
said
that
a
spy
captain
would
always
find
spy
followers
in
that
remark
were
you
and
mr
simple
referring
to
your
own
captain
the
remark
was
mine
what
mr
simple
was
thinking
of
i
ca
tell
but
i
refer
to
the
captain
and
he
has
proved
that
i
was
right
this
bold
answer
of
swinburne
rather
astonished
the
court
who
commenced
him
but
he
kept
to
his
original
assertion
that
i
had
only
answered
generally
to
repel
the
second
charge
i
produced
no
witnesses
but
to
the
third
charge
i
brought
forward
three
witnesses
to
prove
that
captain
hawkins
orders
were
that
i
should
send
no
boats
on
shore
not
that
i
should
not
send
them
on
board
of
the
close
to
us
in
answer
to
the
fourth
charge
i
called
swinburne
who
stated
that
if
i
did
not
he
would
come
forward
swinburne
acknowledged
that
he
accused
the
captain
of
being
shy
and
that
i
reprimanded
him
for
so
doing
did
he
say
that
he
would
report
you
inquired
one
of
the
captains
no
sir
replied
swinburne
he
never
meant
to
do
it
this
was
an
unfortunate
answer
to
the
fifth
charge
i
brought
several
witnesses
to
prove
the
words
of
captain
hawkins
and
the
sense
in
which
they
were
taken
by
the
company
and
the
men
calling
out
shame
when
he
used
the
expression
to
refute
the
other
charges
i
called
one
or
two
witnesses
and
the
court
then
adjourned
inquiring
of
me
when
i
would
be
ready
to
commence
my
defence
i
requested
a
day
to
prepare
which
was
readily
granted
and
the
ensuing
day
the
court
did
not
sit
i
hardly
need
say
that
i
was
busily
employed
arranging
my
defence
with
my
counsel
at
last
all
was
done
and
i
went
to
bed
tired
and
unhappy
but
i
slept
soundly
which
could
not
be
said
of
my
counsel
for
he
went
on
shore
at
eleven
and
sat
up
all
night
making
a
fair
copy
after
all
the
fairest
court
of
justice
is
a
naval
no
of
witnesses
an
evident
inclination
towards
the
prisoner
every
allowance
and
every
favour
granted
him
and
no
legal
quibbles
attended
to
it
is
a
court
of
equity
with
very
few
exceptions
and
the
humbler
the
individual
the
greater
the
chance
in
his
favour
i
was
awoke
the
following
morning
by
my
counsel
who
had
not
gone
to
bed
the
previous
night
and
who
had
come
off
at
seven
to
read
over
with
me
my
defence
at
nine
i
again
proceeded
on
board
and
in
a
short
time
the
court
was
sitting
i
came
in
handed
my
defence
to
the
who
read
it
aloud
to
the
court
i
have
a
copy
still
by
me
and
will
give
the
whole
of
it
to
the
reader
mr
president
and
gentlemen
after
nearly
fourteen
years
service
in
his
majesty
navy
during
which
i
have
been
twice
made
prisoner
twice
wounded
and
once
wrecked
and
as
i
trust
i
shall
prove
to
you
by
certificates
and
the
public
despatches
i
have
done
my
duty
with
zeal
and
honour
i
now
find
myself
in
a
situation
in
which
i
never
expected
to
be
placed
that
of
being
arraigned
before
and
brought
to
a
for
charges
of
mutiny
disaffection
and
disrespect
towards
my
superior
officer
if
the
honourable
court
will
examine
the
certificates
i
am
about
to
produce
they
will
find
that
until
i
sailed
with
captain
hawkins
my
conduct
has
always
been
supposed
to
have
been
diametrically
opposite
to
that
which
is
now
imputed
to
me
i
have
always
been
diligent
and
obedient
to
command
and
i
have
only
to
regret
that
the
captains
with
whom
i
have
had
the
honour
to
sail
are
not
now
present
to
corroborate
by
their
oral
evidence
the
truth
of
these
documents
allow
me
in
the
first
place
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
charges
against
me
are
spread
over
a
large
space
of
time
amounting
to
nearly
eighteen
months
during
the
whole
of
which
period
captain
hawkins
never
stated
to
me
that
it
was
his
intention
to
try
me
by
a
and
although
repeatedly
in
the
presence
of
a
senior
officer
has
never
preferred
any
charge
against
me
the
articles
of
war
state
expressly
that
if
any
officer
soldier
or
marine
has
any
complaint
to
make
he
is
to
do
so
upon
his
arrival
at
any
port
or
fleet
where
he
may
fall
in
with
a
superior
officer
i
admit
that
this
article
of
war
refers
to
complaints
to
be
made
by
inferiors
against
superiors
but
at
the
same
time
i
venture
to
submit
to
the
honourable
court
that
a
superior
is
equally
bound
to
prefer
a
charge
or
to
give
notice
that
the
charge
will
be
preferred
on
the
first
seasonable
opportunity
instead
of
lulling
the
offender
into
security
and
disarming
him
in
his
defence
by
allowing
the
time
to
run
on
so
long
as
to
render
him
incapable
of
bringing
forward
his
witnesses
i
take
the
liberty
of
calling
this
to
your
attention
and
shall
now
proceed
to
answer
the
charges
which
have
been
brought
against
me
i
am
accused
of
having
held
a
conversation
with
an
inferior
officer
on
the
of
his
majesty
brig
in
which
my
captain
was
treated
with
contempt
that
it
may
not
be
supposed
that
mr
swinburne
was
a
new
acquaintance
made
upon
my
joining
the
brig
i
must
observe
that
he
was
an
old
shipmate
with
whom
i
had
served
many
years
and
with
whose
worth
i
was
well
acquainted
he
was
my
instructor
in
my
more
youthful
days
and
has
been
rewarded
for
his
merit
with
the
warrant
which
he
now
holds
as
gunner
of
his
majesty
brig
the
offensive
observation
in
the
first
place
was
not
mine
and
in
the
second
it
was
couched
in
general
terms
here
mr
swinburne
has
pointedly
confessed
that
did
refer
to
the
captain
although
the
observation
was
in
the
plural
but
that
does
not
prove
the
charge
against
me
on
the
contrary
adds
weight
to
the
assertion
of
mr
swinburne
that
i
was
guiltless
of
the
present
charge
that
captain
hawkins
has
acted
as
a
spy
his
own
evidence
on
this
charge
as
well
as
that
brought
forward
by
other
witnesses
will
decidedly
prove
but
as
the
truth
of
the
observation
does
not
warrant
the
utterance
i
am
glad
that
no
such
expression
escaped
my
lips
upon
the
second
charge
i
shall
dwell
but
a
short
time
it
is
true
that
there
is
a
general
order
that
no
stoves
shall
be
alight
after
a
certain
hour
but
i
will
appeal
to
the
honourable
court
whether
a
first
lieutenant
is
not
considered
to
have
a
degree
of
licence
of
judgment
in
all
that
concerns
the
interior
discipline
of
the
ship
the
surgeon
sent
to
say
that
a
stove
was
required
for
one
of
the
sick
i
was
in
bed
at
the
time
and
replied
immediately
in
the
affirmative
does
captain
hawkins
mean
to
assert
to
the
honourable
court
that
he
would
have
refused
the
request
of
the
surgeon
most
certainly
not
the
only
error
i
committed
if
it
were
an
error
was
not
going
through
the
form
of
awaking
captain
hawkins
to
ask
the
permission
which
as
first
lieutenant
i
thought
myself
authorized
to
give
the
charge
against
me
of
having
sent
away
two
boats
contrary
to
his
order
i
have
already
disproved
by
witnesses
the
order
of
captain
hawkins
was
not
to
communicate
with
the
shore
my
reasons
for
sending
away
the
boats
here
captain
hawkins
interposed
and
stated
to
the
president
that
my
reasons
were
not
necessary
to
be
received
the
court
was
cleared
and
on
our
return
the
court
had
decided
that
my
reasons
ought
to
be
given
and
i
continued
my
reasons
for
sending
away
these
boats
or
rather
it
was
one
boat
which
was
despatched
to
the
two
frigates
if
i
remember
well
were
that
the
brig
was
in
a
state
of
mutiny
the
captain
had
tied
up
one
of
the
men
and
the
ship
company
refused
to
be
flogged
captain
hawkins
then
went
on
shore
to
the
admiral
to
report
the
situation
of
his
ship
and
i
conceived
it
my
duty
to
make
it
known
to
the
anchored
close
to
us
i
shall
not
enter
into
further
particulars
as
they
will
only
detain
the
honourable
court
and
i
am
aware
that
this
is
held
upon
my
conduct
and
not
upon
that
of
captain
hawkins
to
the
charge
of
again
holding
disrespectful
language
on
the
as
overheard
by
captain
hawkins
i
must
refer
the
honourable
court
to
the
evidence
in
which
it
is
plainly
proved
that
the
remarks
upon
him
were
not
mine
but
those
of
mr
swinburne
and
that
i
remonstrated
with
mr
swinburne
for
using
such
unguarded
expressions
the
only
point
of
difficulty
is
whether
it
was
not
my
duty
to
have
reported
such
language
i
reply
that
there
is
no
proof
that
i
did
not
intend
to
report
it
but
the
presence
of
captain
hawkins
who
heard
what
was
said
rendered
such
report
unnecessary
on
the
fifth
charge
i
must
beg
that
the
court
will
be
pleased
to
consider
that
some
allowance
ought
to
be
made
for
a
moment
of
irritation
my
character
was
traduced
by
captain
hawkins
supposing
that
i
was
dead
so
much
so
that
even
the
ship
company
cried
out
i
am
aware
that
no
language
of
a
superior
officer
can
warrant
a
retort
from
an
inferior
but
as
what
i
intended
to
imply
by
that
language
is
not
yet
known
although
captain
hawkins
has
given
an
explanation
to
his
i
shall
merely
say
that
i
meant
no
more
by
my
insinuations
than
captain
hawkins
did
at
the
time
by
those
which
he
made
use
of
with
respect
to
me
upon
the
other
trifling
charges
brought
forward
i
lay
no
stress
as
i
consider
them
fully
refuted
by
the
evidence
which
has
been
already
adduced
and
i
shall
merely
observe
that
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
i
have
been
met
with
a
most
decided
hostility
on
the
part
of
captain
hawkins
from
the
time
that
he
first
joined
the
ship
that
on
every
occasion
he
has
used
all
his
efforts
to
render
me
uncomfortable
and
embroil
me
with
others
that
not
content
with
narrowly
watching
my
conduct
on
board
he
has
resorted
to
his
from
the
shore
and
instead
of
assisting
me
in
the
execution
of
a
duty
sufficiently
arduous
he
has
thrown
every
obstacle
in
my
way
placed
inferior
officers
as
spies
over
my
conduct
and
made
me
feel
so
humiliated
in
the
presence
of
the
ship
company
over
which
i
have
had
to
superintend
and
in
the
disciplining
of
which
i
had
a
right
to
look
to
him
for
support
that
were
it
not
that
some
odium
would
necessarily
be
attached
to
the
sentence
i
should
feel
it
as
one
of
the
happiest
events
of
my
life
that
i
were
dismissed
from
the
situation
which
i
now
hold
under
his
command
i
now
beg
that
the
honourable
court
will
allow
the
documents
i
lay
upon
the
table
to
be
read
in
support
of
my
character
when
this
was
over
the
court
was
cleared
that
they
might
decide
upon
the
sentence
i
waited
about
half
an
hour
in
the
greatest
anxiety
when
i
was
again
summoned
to
attend
the
usual
forms
of
reading
the
papers
were
gone
through
and
then
came
the
sentence
which
was
read
by
the
president
he
and
the
whole
court
standing
up
with
their
cocked
hats
on
their
heads
after
the
preamble
it
concluded
with
saying
that
it
was
the
opinion
of
that
court
that
the
charges
had
been
proved
and
therefore
that
lieutenant
peter
simple
was
dismissed
his
ship
but
in
consideration
of
his
good
character
and
services
his
case
was
strongly
recommended
to
the
consideration
of
the
lords
commissioners
of
the
admiralty
chapter
lxiii
peter
looks
upon
his
loss
as
something
gained
goes
on
board
the
to
pack
up
and
is
ordered
to
pack
off
polite
between
relations
mrs
trotter
better
and
better
goes
to
london
and
afterwards
falls
into
all
manner
of
misfortunes
by
the
hands
of
robbers
and
of
his
own
uncle
i
hardly
knew
whether
i
felt
glad
or
sorry
at
this
sentence
on
the
one
hand
it
was
almost
a
deathblow
to
my
future
advancement
or
employment
in
the
service
on
the
other
the
recommendation
very
much
softened
down
the
sentence
and
i
was
quite
happy
to
be
quit
of
captain
hawkins
and
free
to
hasten
to
my
poor
sister
i
bowed
respectfully
to
the
court
which
immediately
adjourned
captain
hawkins
followed
the
captains
on
the
but
none
of
them
would
speak
to
him
so
much
to
his
disadvantage
had
come
out
during
the
trial
about
ten
minutes
afterwards
one
of
the
elder
captains
composing
the
court
called
me
into
the
cabin
mr
simple
said
he
we
are
all
very
sorry
for
you
our
sentence
could
not
be
more
lenient
under
the
circumstances
it
was
that
conversation
with
the
gunner
at
the
taffrail
which
floored
you
it
must
be
a
warning
to
you
to
be
more
careful
in
future
how
you
permit
any
one
to
speak
of
the
conduct
of
your
superiors
on
the
i
am
desired
by
the
president
to
let
you
know
that
it
is
our
intention
to
express
ourselves
very
strongly
to
the
admiral
in
your
behalf
so
much
so
that
if
another
captain
applies
for
you
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
being
appointed
to
a
ship
and
as
for
leaving
your
present
ship
under
any
other
circumstances
i
should
consider
it
a
matter
of
congratulation
i
returned
my
sincere
thanks
and
soon
afterwards
quitted
the
and
went
on
board
of
the
brig
to
pack
up
my
clothes
and
take
leave
of
my
messmates
on
my
arrival
i
found
that
captain
hawkins
had
preceded
me
and
he
was
on
deck
when
i
came
up
the
side
i
hastened
down
into
the
where
i
received
the
condolements
of
my
messmates
simple
i
wish
you
joy
cried
thompson
loud
enough
for
the
captain
to
hear
on
deck
i
wish
i
had
your
luck
i
wish
somebody
would
try
me
by
a
as
it
has
turned
out
replied
i
in
a
loud
voice
and
after
the
communication
made
to
me
by
the
captains
composing
the
court
of
what
they
intend
to
say
to
the
admiralty
i
agree
with
you
thompson
that
it
is
a
very
kind
act
on
the
part
of
captain
hawkins
and
i
feel
quite
grateful
to
them
steward
come
glasses
cried
thompson
and
let
us
drink
success
to
mr
simple
all
this
was
very
annoying
to
captain
hawkins
who
overheard
every
word
when
our
glasses
were
filled
simple
your
good
health
and
may
i
meet
with
as
good
a
messmate
said
thompson
at
this
moment
the
sergeant
of
marines
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
in
a
most
insolent
tone
that
i
was
to
leave
the
ship
immediately
i
was
so
irritated
that
i
threw
my
glass
of
grog
in
his
face
and
he
ran
up
to
the
captain
to
make
the
complaint
but
i
did
not
belong
to
the
ship
and
even
if
i
had
i
would
have
resented
such
impertinence
captain
hawkins
was
in
a
great
rage
and
i
believe
would
have
written
for
another
but
he
had
had
enough
of
them
he
inquired
very
particularly
of
the
sergeant
whether
he
had
told
me
that
i
was
to
leave
the
ship
directly
or
whether
that
captain
hawkins
desired
that
i
should
leave
the
ship
immediately
and
finding
that
he
had
not
given
the
latter
message
which
i
was
aware
of
for
had
he
given
it
i
dare
not
have
acted
as
i
did
he
then
sent
down
again
by
one
of
the
midshipmen
desiring
me
to
leave
the
ship
immediately
my
reply
was
that
i
should
certainly
obey
his
orders
with
the
greatest
pleasure
i
hastened
to
pack
up
my
clothes
reported
myself
ready
to
the
second
lieutenant
who
went
up
for
permission
to
man
a
boat
which
was
refused
by
captain
hawkins
who
said
i
might
go
on
shore
in
a
i
called
one
alongside
shook
hands
with
all
my
messmates
and
when
i
arrived
on
the
with
swinburne
and
some
of
the
best
men
who
came
forward
captain
hawkins
stood
by
the
binnacle
bursting
with
rage
as
i
went
over
the
planeshear
i
took
my
hat
off
to
him
and
wished
him
very
respectfully
adding
if
you
have
any
commands
for
my
captain
hawkins
i
shall
be
glad
to
execute
them
this
observation
which
showed
him
that
i
knew
the
connection
and
correspondence
between
them
made
him
gasp
with
emotion
leave
the
ship
sir
or
by
god
i
put
you
in
irons
for
mutiny
cried
he
i
again
took
off
my
hat
and
went
down
the
side
and
shoved
off
as
soon
as
i
was
a
few
yards
distant
the
men
jumped
on
the
carronades
and
cheered
and
i
perceived
captain
hawkins
order
them
down
and
before
i
was
a
cable
length
from
her
the
pipe
all
hands
to
punishment
so
i
presume
some
of
the
poor
fellows
suffered
for
their
insubordination
in
showing
their
good
will
i
acknowledge
that
i
might
have
left
the
ship
in
a
more
dignified
manner
and
that
my
conduct
was
not
altogether
correct
but
still
i
state
what
i
really
did
do
and
some
allowance
must
be
made
for
my
feelings
this
is
certain
that
my
conduct
after
the
was
more
deserving
of
punishment
than
that
for
which
i
had
been
tried
but
i
was
in
a
state
of
feverish
excitement
and
hardly
knew
what
i
did
when
i
arrived
at
sally
port
i
had
my
effects
wheeled
up
to
the
blue
posts
and
packing
up
those
which
i
most
required
i
threw
off
my
uniform
and
was
once
more
a
gentleman
at
large
i
took
my
place
in
the
mail
for
that
evening
sent
a
letter
of
thanks
with
a
few
bank
notes
to
my
counsel
and
then
sat
down
and
wrote
a
long
letter
to
acquainting
him
with
the
events
which
had
taken
place
i
had
just
finished
and
sealed
it
up
when
in
came
mrs
trotter
oh
my
dear
mr
simple
i
so
sorry
and
i
have
come
to
console
you
nothing
like
women
when
men
are
in
affliction
as
poor
trotter
used
to
say
as
he
laid
his
head
in
my
lap
when
do
you
go
to
town
this
evening
mrs
trotter
i
hope
i
am
to
continue
to
attend
the
ship
i
hope
so
too
mrs
trotter
i
have
no
doubt
but
you
will
now
mr
simple
how
are
you
off
for
money
do
you
want
a
little
you
can
pay
me
do
be
afraid
i
not
quite
so
poor
as
i
was
when
you
came
down
to
mess
with
trotter
and
me
and
when
you
gave
me
the
dozen
pair
of
stockings
i
know
what
it
is
to
want
money
and
what
it
is
to
want
friends
many
thanks
to
you
mrs
trotter
replied
i
but
i
have
sufficient
to
take
me
home
and
then
i
can
obtain
more
well
i
glad
of
it
but
it
was
offered
in
earnest
god
bless
you
come
mr
simple
give
me
a
kiss
it
wo
be
the
first
time
i
kissed
her
for
i
felt
grateful
for
her
kindness
and
with
a
little
smirking
and
ogling
she
quitted
the
room
i
could
not
help
thinking
after
she
was
gone
how
little
we
know
the
hearts
of
others
if
i
had
been
asked
if
mrs
trotter
was
a
person
to
have
done
a
generous
action
from
what
i
had
seen
of
her
in
adversity
i
should
have
decidedly
said
no
yet
in
this
offer
she
was
disinterested
for
she
knew
the
service
well
enough
to
be
aware
that
i
had
little
chance
of
being
a
first
lieutenant
again
and
of
being
of
service
to
her
and
how
often
does
it
also
occur
that
those
who
ought
from
gratitude
or
long
friendship
to
do
all
they
can
to
assist
you
turn
from
you
in
your
necessity
and
prove
false
and
treacherous
it
is
god
alone
who
knows
our
hearts
i
sent
my
letter
to
to
the
admiral
office
sat
down
to
a
dinner
which
i
could
not
taste
and
at
seven
got
into
the
mail
when
i
arrived
in
town
i
was
much
worse
but
i
did
not
wait
more
than
an
hour
i
took
my
place
in
a
coach
which
did
not
go
to
the
town
near
which
we
resided
for
i
had
inquired
and
found
that
coach
was
full
and
i
did
not
choose
to
wait
another
day
the
coach
in
which
i
took
my
place
went
within
forty
miles
of
the
vicarage
and
i
intended
to
post
across
the
country
the
next
evening
i
arrived
at
the
point
of
separation
and
taking
out
my
portmanteau
ordered
a
chaise
and
set
off
for
what
had
once
been
my
home
i
could
hardly
hold
my
head
up
i
was
so
ill
and
i
lay
in
a
corner
of
the
chaise
in
a
sort
of
dream
kept
from
sleeping
from
intense
pain
in
the
forehead
and
temples
it
was
about
nine
at
night
when
we
were
in
a
dreadful
jolting
road
the
shocks
proceeding
from
which
gave
me
agonizing
pain
that
the
chaise
was
stopped
by
two
men
who
dragged
me
out
on
the
grass
one
stood
over
me
while
the
other
rifled
the
chaise
the
who
appeared
a
party
to
the
transaction
remained
quietly
on
his
horse
and
as
soon
as
they
had
taken
my
effects
turned
round
and
drove
off
they
then
rifled
my
person
taking
away
everything
that
i
had
leaving
me
nothing
but
my
trousers
and
shirt
after
a
short
consultation
they
ordered
me
to
walk
on
in
the
direction
in
which
we
had
been
proceeding
in
the
chaise
and
to
hasten
as
fast
as
i
could
or
they
would
blow
my
brains
out
i
complied
with
their
request
thinking
myself
fortunate
to
have
escaped
so
well
i
knew
that
i
was
still
thirty
miles
at
least
from
the
vicarage
but
ill
as
i
was
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
reach
it
on
foot
i
walked
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
but
i
got
on
but
slowly
i
reeled
from
one
side
of
the
road
to
the
other
and
occasionally
sat
down
to
rest
morning
dawned
and
i
perceived
habitations
not
far
from
me
i
staggered
on
in
my
course
the
fever
now
raged
in
me
my
head
was
splitting
with
agony
and
i
tottered
to
a
bank
near
a
small
neat
cottage
on
the
side
of
the
road
i
have
a
faint
recollection
of
some
one
coming
to
me
and
taking
my
hand
but
nothing
further
and
it
was
not
till
many
months
afterwards
that
i
became
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
which
i
now
relate
it
appears
that
the
owner
of
the
cottage
was
a
lieutenant
in
the
army
who
had
on
account
of
his
wounds
i
was
humanely
taken
into
his
house
laid
on
a
bed
and
a
surgeon
requested
to
come
to
me
immediately
i
had
now
lost
all
recollection
and
who
i
was
they
could
not
ascertain
my
pockets
were
empty
and
it
was
only
by
the
mark
on
my
linen
that
they
found
that
my
name
was
simple
for
three
weeks
i
remained
in
a
state
of
alternate
stupor
and
delirium
when
the
latter
came
on
i
raved
of
lord
privilege
and
celeste
mr
selwin
the
officer
who
had
so
kindly
assisted
me
knew
that
simple
was
the
patronymic
name
of
lord
privilege
and
he
immediately
wrote
to
his
lordship
stating
that
a
young
man
of
the
name
of
simple
who
in
his
delirium
called
upon
him
and
captain
was
lying
in
a
most
dangerous
state
in
his
house
and
that
as
he
presumed
i
was
a
relative
of
his
lordship
he
had
deemed
it
right
to
apprise
him
of
the
fact
my
uncle
who
knew
that
it
must
be
me
thought
this
too
favourable
an
opportunity
provided
i
should
live
not
to
have
me
in
his
power
he
wrote
to
say
that
he
would
be
there
in
a
day
or
two
at
the
same
time
thanking
mr
selwin
for
his
kind
attention
to
his
poor
nephew
and
requesting
that
no
expense
might
be
spared
when
my
uncle
arrived
which
he
did
in
his
own
chariot
the
crisis
of
the
fever
was
over
but
i
was
still
in
a
state
of
stupor
arising
from
extreme
debility
he
thanked
mr
selwin
for
his
attention
which
he
said
he
was
afraid
was
of
little
avail
as
i
was
every
year
becoming
more
deranged
and
he
expressed
his
fears
that
it
would
terminate
in
chronic
lunacy
his
poor
father
died
in
the
same
state
continued
my
uncle
passing
his
hand
across
his
eyes
as
if
much
affected
i
have
brought
my
physician
with
me
to
see
if
he
can
be
moved
i
shall
not
be
satisfied
unless
i
am
with
him
night
and
day
the
physician
who
was
my
uncle
valet
took
me
by
the
hand
felt
my
pulse
examined
my
eyes
and
pronounced
that
it
would
be
very
easy
to
move
me
and
that
i
should
recover
sooner
in
a
more
airy
room
of
course
mr
selwin
raised
no
objections
putting
down
all
to
my
regard
for
me
and
my
clothes
were
put
on
me
as
i
lay
in
a
state
of
insensibility
and
i
was
lifted
into
the
chariot
it
is
most
wonderful
that
i
did
not
die
from
being
thus
taken
out
of
my
bed
in
such
a
state
but
it
pleased
heaven
that
it
should
be
otherwise
had
such
an
event
taken
place
it
would
probably
have
pleased
my
uncle
much
better
than
my
surviving
when
i
was
in
the
carriage
supported
by
the
my
uncle
again
thanked
mr
selwin
begged
that
he
would
command
his
interest
wrote
a
handsome
cheque
for
the
surgeon
who
had
attended
me
and
getting
into
the
carriage
drove
off
with
me
still
in
a
state
of
insensibility
that
is
i
was
not
so
insensible
but
i
think
i
felt
i
had
been
removed
and
i
heard
the
rattling
of
the
wheels
but
my
mind
was
so
uncollected
and
i
was
in
a
state
of
such
weakness
that
i
could
not
feel
assured
of
it
for
a
minute
for
some
days
afterwards
for
i
recollect
nothing
about
the
journey
i
found
myself
in
bed
in
a
dark
room
and
my
arms
confined
i
recalled
my
senses
and
by
degrees
was
able
to
recollect
all
that
had
occurred
until
i
laid
down
by
the
roadside
where
was
i
the
room
was
dark
i
could
distinguish
nothing
that
i
had
attempted
to
do
myself
some
injury
i
took
for
granted
or
my
arms
would
not
have
been
secured
i
had
been
in
a
fever
and
delirious
i
supposed
and
had
now
recovered
i
had
been
in
a
reverie
for
more
than
an
hour
wondering
why
i
was
left
alone
when
the
door
of
the
apartment
opened
who
is
there
inquired
i
oh
you
come
to
yourself
again
said
a
gruff
voice
then
i
give
you
a
little
daylight
he
took
down
a
shutter
which
covered
the
whole
of
the
window
and
a
flood
of
light
poured
in
which
blinded
me
i
shut
my
eyes
and
by
degrees
admitted
the
light
until
i
could
bear
it
i
looked
at
the
apartment
the
walls
were
bare
and
whitewashed
i
was
on
a
i
looked
at
the
window
it
was
closed
up
with
iron
why
where
am
i
inquired
i
of
the
man
with
alarm
where
are
you
replied
he
why
in
bedlam
chapter
lxiv
as
said
it
a
long
lane
that
has
no
turning
i
am
rescued
and
happiness
pours
in
upon
me
as
fast
as
misery
before
overwhelmed
me
the
shock
was
too
great
i
fell
back
on
my
pillow
insensible
how
long
i
laid
i
know
not
but
when
i
recovered
the
keeper
was
gone
and
i
found
a
jug
of
water
and
some
bread
by
the
side
of
the
bed
i
drank
the
water
and
the
effect
it
had
upon
me
was
surprising
i
felt
that
i
could
get
up
and
i
rose
my
arms
had
been
unpinioned
during
my
swoon
i
got
on
my
feet
and
staggered
to
the
window
i
looked
out
saw
the
bright
sun
the
the
houses
opposite
all
looked
cheerful
and
gay
but
i
was
a
prisoner
in
a
madhouse
had
i
been
mad
i
reflected
and
supposed
that
i
had
been
and
had
been
confined
by
those
who
knew
nothing
of
me
it
never
came
into
my
head
that
my
uncle
had
been
a
party
to
it
i
threw
myself
on
the
bed
and
relieved
myself
with
tears
it
was
about
noon
that
the
medical
people
attended
by
the
keepers
and
others
came
into
my
apartment
is
he
quite
quiet
o
lord
yes
sir
as
quiet
as
a
lamb
replied
the
man
who
had
before
entered
i
then
spoke
to
the
medical
gentleman
begging
him
to
tell
why
and
how
i
had
been
brought
here
he
answered
mildly
and
soothingly
saying
that
i
was
there
at
the
wish
of
my
friends
and
that
every
care
would
be
taken
of
me
that
he
was
aware
that
my
paroxysms
were
only
occasional
and
that
during
the
time
i
was
quiet
i
should
have
every
indulgence
that
could
be
granted
and
that
he
hoped
that
i
soon
should
be
perfectly
well
and
be
permitted
to
leave
the
hospital
i
replied
by
stating
who
i
was
and
how
i
had
been
taken
ill
the
doctor
shook
his
head
advised
me
to
lie
down
as
much
as
possible
and
then
quitted
me
to
visit
the
other
patients
as
i
afterwards
discovered
my
uncle
had
had
me
confined
upon
the
plea
that
i
was
a
young
man
who
was
deranged
with
an
idea
that
his
name
was
simple
and
that
he
was
the
heir
to
the
title
and
estates
that
i
was
very
troublesome
at
times
forcing
my
way
into
his
house
and
insulting
the
servants
but
in
every
other
respect
was
harmless
that
my
paroxysms
generally
ended
in
a
violent
fever
and
it
was
more
from
the
fear
of
my
coming
to
some
harm
than
from
any
towards
the
poor
young
man
that
he
wished
me
to
remain
in
the
hospital
and
be
taken
care
of
the
reader
may
at
once
perceive
the
art
of
this
communication
i
having
no
idea
why
i
was
confined
would
of
course
continue
to
style
myself
by
my
true
name
and
as
long
as
i
did
this
so
long
would
i
be
considered
in
a
deranged
state
the
reader
must
not
therefore
be
surprised
when
i
tell
him
that
i
remained
in
bedlam
for
one
year
and
eight
months
the
doctor
called
upon
me
for
two
or
three
days
and
finding
me
quiet
ordered
me
to
be
allowed
books
paper
and
ink
to
amuse
myself
but
every
attempt
at
explanation
was
certain
to
be
the
signal
for
him
to
leave
my
apartment
i
found
therefore
not
only
by
him
but
from
the
keeper
who
paid
no
attention
to
anything
i
said
that
i
had
no
chance
of
being
listened
to
or
of
obtaining
my
release
after
the
first
month
the
doctor
came
to
me
no
more
i
was
a
quiet
patient
and
he
received
the
report
of
the
keeper
i
was
sent
there
with
every
necessary
document
to
prove
that
i
was
mad
and
although
a
very
little
may
establish
a
case
of
lunacy
it
requires
something
very
strong
indeed
to
prove
that
you
are
in
your
right
senses
in
bedlam
i
found
it
impossible
at
the
same
time
i
was
well
treated
was
allowed
all
necessary
comforts
and
such
amusement
as
could
be
obtained
from
books
i
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
the
keeper
except
that
he
was
too
much
employed
to
waste
his
time
in
listening
to
what
he
did
not
believe
i
wrote
several
letters
to
my
sister
and
to
during
the
first
two
or
three
months
and
requested
the
keeper
to
put
them
in
the
post
this
he
promised
to
do
never
refusing
to
take
the
letters
but
as
i
afterwards
found
out
they
were
invariably
destroyed
yet
i
still
bore
up
with
the
hopes
of
release
for
some
time
but
the
anxiety
relative
to
my
sister
when
i
thought
of
her
situation
my
thoughts
of
celeste
and
of
sometimes
quite
overcame
me
then
indeed
i
would
almost
become
frantic
and
the
keeper
would
report
that
i
had
had
a
paroxysm
after
six
months
i
became
melancholy
and
i
wasted
away
i
no
longer
attempted
to
amuse
myself
but
sat
all
day
with
my
eyes
fixed
upon
vacancy
i
no
longer
attended
to
my
person
i
allowed
my
beard
to
grow
my
face
was
never
washed
unless
mechanically
when
ordered
by
the
keeper
and
if
i
was
not
mad
there
was
every
prospect
of
my
soon
becoming
so
life
passed
away
as
a
blank
i
had
become
indifferent
to
everything
i
noted
time
no
more
the
change
of
seasons
was
unperceived
even
the
day
and
the
night
followed
without
my
regarding
them
i
was
in
this
unfortunate
situation
when
one
day
the
door
was
opened
and
as
had
been
often
the
custom
during
my
imprisonment
visitors
were
going
round
the
establishment
to
indulge
their
curiosity
in
witnessing
the
degradation
of
their
or
to
offer
their
commiseration
i
paid
no
heed
to
them
not
even
casting
up
my
eyes
this
young
man
said
the
medical
gentleman
who
accompanied
the
party
has
entertained
the
strange
idea
that
his
name
is
simple
and
that
he
is
the
rightful
heir
to
the
title
and
property
of
lord
privilege
one
of
the
visitors
came
up
to
me
and
looked
me
in
the
face
and
so
he
is
cried
he
to
the
doctor
who
looked
with
astonishment
peter
you
know
me
i
started
up
it
was
general
i
flew
into
his
arms
and
burst
into
tears
sir
said
general
leading
me
to
the
chair
and
seating
me
upon
it
i
tell
you
that
mr
simple
the
nephew
of
lord
privilege
and
i
believe
the
heir
to
the
title
if
therefore
his
assertion
of
such
being
the
case
is
the
only
proof
of
his
insanity
he
is
illegally
confined
i
am
here
a
foreigner
and
a
prisoner
on
parole
but
i
am
not
without
friends
my
lord
belmore
said
he
turning
to
another
of
the
visitors
who
had
accompanied
him
i
pledge
you
my
honour
that
what
i
state
is
true
and
i
request
that
you
will
immediately
demand
the
release
of
this
poor
young
man
i
assure
you
sir
that
i
have
lord
privilege
letter
observed
the
doctor
lord
privilege
is
a
scoundrel
replied
general
but
there
is
justice
to
be
obtained
in
this
country
and
he
shall
pay
dearly
for
his
de
my
dear
peter
how
fortunate
was
my
visit
to
this
horrid
place
i
had
heard
so
much
of
the
excellent
arrangements
of
this
establishment
that
i
agreed
to
walk
round
with
lord
belmore
but
i
find
that
it
is
abused
indeed
general
i
have
been
treated
with
kindness
replied
i
and
particularly
by
this
gentleman
it
was
not
his
fault
general
and
lord
belmore
then
inquired
of
the
doctor
if
he
had
any
objection
to
my
release
none
whatever
my
lord
even
if
he
were
insane
although
i
now
see
how
i
have
been
imposed
upon
we
allow
the
friends
of
any
patient
to
remove
him
if
they
think
that
they
can
pay
him
more
attention
he
may
leave
with
you
this
moment
i
now
did
feel
my
brain
turn
with
the
revulsion
from
despair
to
hope
and
i
fell
back
in
my
seat
the
doctor
perceiving
my
condition
bled
me
copiously
and
laid
me
on
the
bed
where
i
remained
more
than
an
hour
watched
by
general
i
then
got
up
calm
and
thankful
i
was
shaved
by
the
barber
of
the
establishment
washed
and
dressed
myself
and
leaning
on
the
general
arm
was
let
out
i
cast
my
eyes
upon
the
two
celebrated
stone
figures
of
melancholy
and
raving
madness
as
i
passed
them
i
trembled
and
clung
more
tightly
to
the
general
arm
was
assisted
into
the
carriage
and
bade
farewell
to
madness
and
misery
the
general
said
nothing
until
we
approached
the
hotel
where
he
resided
in
and
then
he
inquired
in
a
low
voice
whether
i
could
bear
more
excitement
it
is
celeste
you
mean
general
it
is
my
dear
boy
she
is
here
and
he
squeezed
my
hand
alas
cried
i
what
hopes
have
i
now
of
celeste
more
than
you
had
before
replied
the
general
she
lives
but
for
you
and
if
you
are
a
beggar
i
have
a
competence
to
make
you
sufficiently
comfortable
i
returned
the
general
pressure
of
the
hand
but
could
not
speak
we
descended
and
in
a
minute
i
was
led
by
the
father
into
the
arms
of
the
astonished
daughter
i
must
pass
over
a
few
days
during
which
i
had
almost
recovered
my
health
and
spirits
and
had
narrated
my
adventures
to
general
and
celeste
my
first
object
was
to
discover
my
sister
what
had
become
of
poor
ellen
in
the
destitute
condition
in
which
she
had
been
left
i
knew
not
and
i
resolved
to
go
down
to
the
vicarage
and
make
inquiries
i
did
not
however
set
off
until
a
legal
adviser
had
been
sent
for
by
general
and
due
notice
given
to
lord
privilege
of
an
action
to
be
immediately
brought
against
him
for
false
imprisonment
i
set
off
in
the
mail
and
the
next
evening
arrived
at
the
town
of
i
hastened
to
the
parsonage
and
the
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
as
i
thought
of
my
mother
my
poor
father
and
the
peculiar
and
doubtful
situation
of
my
dear
sister
i
was
answered
by
a
boy
in
livery
and
found
the
present
incumbent
at
home
he
received
me
politely
listened
to
my
story
and
then
replied
that
my
sister
had
set
off
for
london
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
and
that
she
had
not
communicated
her
intentions
to
any
one
here
then
was
all
clue
lost
and
i
was
in
despair
i
walked
to
the
town
in
time
to
throw
myself
into
the
mail
and
the
next
evening
joined
celeste
and
the
general
to
whom
i
communicated
the
intelligence
and
requested
advice
how
to
proceed
lord
belmore
called
the
next
morning
and
the
general
consulted
him
his
lordship
took
great
interest
in
my
concerns
and
previous
to
any
further
steps
advised
me
to
step
into
his
carriage
and
allow
him
to
relate
my
case
to
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
this
was
done
immediately
and
as
i
had
now
an
opportunity
of
speaking
freely
to
his
lordship
i
explained
to
him
the
conduct
of
captain
hawkins
and
his
connection
with
my
uncle
also
the
reason
of
my
uncle
persecution
his
lordship
finding
me
under
such
powerful
protection
as
lord
belmore
and
having
an
eye
to
my
future
claims
which
my
uncle
conduct
gave
him
reason
to
suppose
were
well
founded
was
extremely
gracious
and
said
that
i
should
hear
from
him
in
a
day
or
two
he
kept
his
word
and
on
the
third
day
after
my
interview
i
received
a
note
announcing
my
promotion
to
the
rank
of
commander
i
was
delighted
with
this
good
fortune
as
was
general
and
celeste
when
at
the
admiralty
i
inquired
about
and
found
that
he
was
expected
home
every
day
he
had
gained
great
reputation
in
the
east
indies
was
chief
in
command
at
the
taking
of
some
of
the
islands
and
it
was
said
was
to
be
created
a
baronet
for
his
services
everything
wore
a
favourable
aspect
excepting
the
disappearance
of
my
sister
this
was
a
weight
on
my
mind
i
could
not
remove
but
i
have
forgotten
to
inform
the
reader
by
what
means
general
and
celeste
arrived
so
opportunely
in
england
martinique
had
been
captured
by
our
forces
about
six
months
before
and
the
whole
of
the
garrison
surrendered
as
prisoners
of
war
general
was
sent
home
and
allowed
to
be
on
parole
although
born
a
frenchman
he
had
very
high
connections
in
ireland
of
whom
lord
belmore
was
one
when
they
arrived
they
had
made
every
inquiry
for
me
without
success
they
knew
that
i
had
been
tried
by
a
and
dismissed
my
ship
but
after
that
no
clue
could
be
found
for
my
discovery
celeste
who
was
fearful
that
some
dreadful
accident
had
occurred
to
me
had
suffered
very
much
in
health
and
general
perceiving
how
much
his
daughter
happiness
depended
upon
her
attachment
for
me
had
made
up
his
mind
that
if
i
were
found
we
should
be
united
i
hardly
need
say
how
delighted
he
was
when
he
discovered
me
though
in
a
situation
so
little
to
be
envied
the
story
of
my
incarceration
of
the
action
to
be
brought
against
my
uncle
and
the
reports
of
foul
play
relative
to
the
succession
had
in
the
meantime
been
widely
circulated
among
the
nobility
and
i
found
that
every
attention
was
paid
me
and
i
was
repeatedly
invited
out
as
an
object
of
curiosity
and
speculation
the
loss
of
my
sister
also
was
a
subject
of
much
interest
and
many
people
from
goodwill
made
every
inquiry
to
discover
her
i
had
returned
one
day
from
the
solicitor
who
had
advertised
for
her
in
the
newspapers
without
success
when
i
found
a
letter
for
me
on
the
table
in
an
admiralty
enclosure
i
opened
it
the
enclosure
was
one
from
who
had
just
cast
anchor
at
spithead
and
who
had
requested
that
the
letter
should
be
forwarded
to
me
if
any
one
could
tell
my
address
i
tore
it
open
my
dear
peter
where
are
and
what
has
become
of
you
i
have
received
no
letters
for
these
two
years
and
i
have
fretted
myself
to
death
i
received
your
letter
about
the
rascally
but
perhaps
you
have
not
heard
that
the
little
scoundrel
is
dead
yes
peter
he
brought
your
letter
out
in
his
own
ship
and
that
was
his
i
met
him
at
a
private
party
he
brought
up
your
name
i
allowed
him
to
abuse
you
and
then
told
him
he
was
a
liar
and
a
scoundrel
upon
which
he
challenged
me
very
much
against
his
will
but
the
affront
was
so
public
that
he
could
help
himself
upon
which
i
shot
him
with
all
the
in
the
world
and
could
he
have
jumped
up
again
twenty
times
like
i
would
have
shot
him
every
time
the
dirty
scoundrel
but
there
an
end
of
him
nobody
pitied
him
for
every
one
hated
him
and
the
admiral
only
looked
grave
and
then
was
very
much
obliged
to
me
for
giving
him
a
vacancy
for
his
nephew
from
some
unknown
hand
but
i
presume
from
the
officers
of
his
ship
i
received
a
packet
of
correspondence
between
him
and
your
worthy
uncle
which
is
about
as
elegant
a
piece
of
rascality
as
ever
was
carried
on
between
two
scoundrels
but
that
not
all
peter
i
got
a
young
woman
for
you
who
will
make
your
heart
glad
not
mademoiselle
celeste
for
i
know
where
she
is
but
the
who
went
out
to
india
her
husband
was
sent
home
as
an
invalid
and
she
was
allowed
her
passage
home
with
him
in
my
frigate
finding
that
he
belonged
to
the
regiment
i
talked
to
him
about
one
who
married
in
ireland
and
mentioned
the
girl
name
and
when
he
discovered
that
he
was
a
countryman
of
mine
he
told
me
that
his
real
name
was
sure
enough
but
that
he
had
always
served
as
and
that
his
wife
on
board
was
the
young
woman
in
question
upon
which
i
sent
to
speak
to
her
and
telling
her
that
i
knew
all
about
it
and
mentioning
the
names
of
ella
flanagan
and
her
mother
who
had
given
me
the
information
she
was
quite
astonished
and
when
i
asked
her
what
had
become
of
the
child
which
she
took
in
place
of
her
own
she
told
me
that
it
had
been
drowned
at
plymouth
and
that
her
husband
was
saved
at
the
same
time
by
a
young
officer
name
i
have
here
says
she
and
then
she
pulled
out
of
her
neck
your
card
with
peter
simple
on
it
says
i
you
know
good
woman
that
in
helping
on
the
rascally
exchange
of
children
you
ruin
that
very
young
man
who
saved
your
husband
for
you
deprive
him
of
his
title
and
property
she
stared
like
a
stuck
pig
when
i
said
so
and
then
cursed
and
blamed
herself
and
declared
she
right
you
as
soon
as
we
came
home
and
most
anxious
she
is
still
to
do
so
for
she
loves
the
very
name
of
you
so
you
see
peter
a
good
action
has
its
reward
sometimes
in
this
world
and
a
bad
action
also
seeing
as
how
i
shot
that
confounded
villain
who
dared
to
you
i
have
plenty
more
to
say
to
you
peter
but
i
do
like
writing
what
perhaps
may
never
be
read
so
i
wait
till
i
hear
from
you
and
then
as
soon
as
i
get
through
my
business
we
will
set
to
and
trounce
that
scoundrel
of
an
uncle
i
have
twenty
thousand
pounds
jammed
together
in
the
consolidated
besides
the
spice
islands
which
will
be
a
pretty
penny
and
every
farthing
of
it
shall
go
to
right
you
peter
and
make
a
lord
of
you
as
i
promised
you
often
that
you
should
be
and
if
you
win
you
shall
pay
and
if
you
do
then
d
n
the
luck
and
d
n
the
money
too
i
beg
you
will
offer
my
best
regards
to
miss
ellen
and
say
how
happy
i
shall
be
to
hear
that
she
is
well
but
it
has
always
been
on
my
mind
peter
that
your
father
did
not
leave
too
much
behind
him
and
i
wish
to
know
how
you
both
get
on
i
left
you
a
blanche
my
agent
and
i
only
hope
that
you
have
taken
advantage
of
it
if
required
if
not
you
not
the
peter
that
i
left
behind
me
so
now
farewell
and
do
forget
to
answer
my
letter
in
no
time
ever
yours
terence
this
was
indeed
joyful
intelligence
i
handed
the
letter
to
general
who
read
it
celeste
hanging
over
his
shoulder
and
perusing
it
at
the
same
time
this
is
well
said
the
general
peter
i
wish
you
joy
and
celeste
i
ought
to
wish
you
joy
also
at
your
future
prospects
it
will
indeed
be
a
gratification
if
ever
i
hail
you
as
lady
privilege
celeste
said
i
you
did
not
reject
me
when
i
was
pennyless
and
in
disgrace
o
my
poor
sister
ellen
if
i
could
but
find
you
how
happy
should
i
be
i
sat
down
to
write
to
acquainting
him
with
all
that
had
occurred
and
the
loss
of
my
dear
sister
the
day
after
the
receipt
of
my
letter
burst
into
the
room
after
the
first
moments
of
congratulation
were
past
he
said
my
heart
broke
peter
about
your
sister
ellen
find
her
i
must
i
shall
give
up
my
ship
for
i
never
give
up
the
search
as
long
as
i
live
i
must
find
her
do
pray
my
dear
and
i
only
wish
wish
what
peter
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
wish
that
if
i
find
her
you
give
her
to
me
for
my
trouble
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
nothing
would
give
me
greater
pleasure
but
god
knows
to
what
wretchedness
and
want
may
have
compelled
her
shame
on
you
peter
to
think
so
of
your
sister
i
pledge
my
honour
for
her
poor
miserable
and
unhappy
she
may
be
but
no
no
peter
you
do
know
you
do
love
her
as
i
do
if
you
can
allow
such
thoughts
to
enter
your
mind
this
conversation
took
place
at
the
window
we
then
turned
round
to
general
and
celeste
captain
said
the
general
sir
terence
if
you
please
general
his
majesty
has
given
me
a
handle
to
my
name
i
congratulate
you
sir
terence
said
the
general
shaking
him
by
the
hand
what
i
was
about
to
say
is
that
i
hope
you
will
take
up
your
quarters
at
this
hotel
and
we
will
all
live
together
i
trust
that
we
shall
soon
find
ellen
in
the
meanwhile
we
have
no
time
to
lose
in
our
exposure
of
lord
privilege
is
the
woman
in
town
yes
and
under
lock
and
key
but
the
devil
a
fear
of
her
millions
would
not
bribe
her
to
wrong
him
who
risked
his
life
for
her
husband
she
irish
general
to
the
back
bone
nevertheless
peter
we
must
go
to
our
solicitor
to
give
the
intelligence
that
he
may
take
the
necessary
steps
for
three
weeks
was
diligent
in
his
search
for
ellen
employing
every
description
of
emissary
without
success
in
the
meanwhile
the
general
and
i
were
prosecuting
our
cause
against
lord
privilege
one
morning
lord
belmore
called
upon
us
and
asked
the
general
if
we
would
accompany
him
to
the
theatre
to
see
two
celebrated
pieces
performed
in
the
latter
which
was
a
musical
farce
a
new
performer
was
to
come
out
of
whom
report
spoke
highly
celeste
consented
and
after
an
early
dinner
we
joined
his
lordship
in
his
private
box
which
was
above
the
stage
on
the
first
tier
the
first
piece
was
played
and
celeste
who
had
never
seen
the
performance
of
young
was
delighted
the
curtain
then
drew
up
for
the
second
piece
in
the
second
act
the
new
performer
a
miss
henderson
was
led
by
the
manager
on
the
stage
she
was
apparently
much
frightened
and
excited
but
three
rounds
of
applause
gave
her
courage
and
she
proceeded
at
the
very
first
notes
of
her
voice
i
was
startled
and
who
was
behind
threw
himself
forward
to
look
at
her
but
as
we
were
almost
directly
above
and
her
head
was
turned
the
other
way
we
could
not
distinguish
her
features
as
she
proceeded
in
her
song
she
gained
courage
and
her
face
was
turned
towards
us
and
she
cast
her
eyes
up
saw
me
the
recognition
was
mutual
i
held
out
my
arm
but
could
not
speak
she
staggered
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
is
ellen
cried
rushing
past
me
and
making
one
spring
down
on
the
stage
he
carried
her
off
before
any
other
person
could
come
to
her
assistance
i
followed
him
and
found
him
with
ellen
still
in
his
arms
and
the
actresses
assisting
in
her
recovery
the
manager
came
forward
to
apologize
stating
that
the
young
lady
was
too
ill
to
proceed
and
the
audience
who
had
witnessed
the
behaviour
of
and
myself
were
satisfied
with
the
romance
in
real
life
which
had
been
exhibited
her
part
was
read
by
another
but
the
piece
was
little
attended
to
every
one
trying
to
find
out
the
occasion
of
this
uncommon
occurrence
in
the
meantime
ellen
was
put
into
a
by
and
me
and
we
drove
to
the
hotel
where
we
were
soon
joined
by
the
general
and
celeste
chapter
lxv
it
never
rains
but
it
pours
whether
it
be
good
or
bad
news
i
succeed
in
everything
and
to
everything
my
wife
my
title
and
estate
and
all
well
that
ends
well
i
shall
pass
over
the
scenes
which
followed
and
give
my
history
in
her
own
words
i
wrote
to
you
my
dear
peter
to
tell
you
that
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
pay
all
my
father
debts
with
your
money
and
that
there
were
but
sixty
pounds
left
when
every
claim
had
been
satisfied
and
i
requested
you
to
come
to
me
as
soon
as
you
could
that
i
might
have
your
counsel
and
assistance
as
to
my
future
arrangements
i
received
your
letter
ellen
and
was
hastening
to
you
when
but
no
matter
i
will
tell
my
story
afterwards
day
after
day
i
waited
with
anxiety
for
a
letter
and
then
wrote
to
the
officers
of
the
ship
to
know
if
any
accident
had
occurred
i
received
an
answer
from
the
surgeon
informing
me
that
you
had
quitted
portsmouth
to
join
me
and
had
not
since
been
heard
of
you
may
imagine
my
distress
at
this
communication
as
i
did
not
doubt
but
that
something
dreadful
had
occurred
as
i
knew
too
well
that
nothing
would
have
detained
you
from
me
at
such
a
time
the
new
vicar
appointed
had
come
down
to
look
over
the
house
and
to
make
arrangements
for
bringing
in
his
family
the
furniture
he
had
previously
agreed
to
take
at
a
valuation
and
the
sum
had
been
appropriated
in
liquidation
of
your
father
debts
i
had
already
been
permitted
to
remain
longer
than
was
usual
and
had
no
alternative
but
to
quit
which
i
did
not
do
until
the
last
moment
i
could
not
leave
my
address
for
i
knew
not
where
i
was
to
go
i
took
my
place
in
the
coach
and
arrived
in
london
my
first
object
was
to
secure
the
means
of
livelihood
by
offering
myself
as
a
governess
but
i
found
great
difficulties
from
not
being
able
to
procure
a
good
reference
and
from
not
having
already
served
in
that
capacity
at
last
i
was
taken
into
a
family
to
bring
up
three
little
girls
but
i
soon
found
out
how
little
chance
i
had
of
comfort
the
lady
had
objected
to
me
as
too
for
this
same
reason
the
gentleman
insisted
upon
my
being
engaged
thus
was
i
a
source
of
disunion
the
lady
treated
me
with
harshness
and
the
gentleman
with
too
much
attention
at
last
her
and
his
persecution
were
both
so
intolerable
that
i
gave
notice
that
i
should
leave
my
situation
i
beg
pardon
miss
ellen
but
you
will
oblige
me
with
the
name
and
residence
of
that
gentleman
said
indeed
ellen
do
no
such
thing
replied
i
continue
your
story
i
could
not
obtain
another
situation
as
governess
for
as
i
always
stated
where
i
had
been
and
did
not
choose
to
give
the
precise
reason
for
quitting
merely
stating
that
i
was
not
comfortable
whenever
the
lady
was
called
upon
for
my
character
she
invariably
spoke
of
me
so
as
to
prevent
my
obtaining
a
situation
at
last
i
was
engaged
as
teacher
to
a
school
i
had
better
have
taken
a
situation
as
housemaid
i
was
expected
to
be
everywhere
to
do
everything
was
up
at
daylight
and
never
in
bed
till
past
midnight
fared
very
badly
and
was
equally
ill
paid
but
still
it
was
honest
employment
and
i
remained
there
for
more
than
a
year
but
though
as
economical
as
possible
my
salary
would
not
maintain
me
in
clothes
and
washing
which
was
all
i
required
there
was
a
master
of
elocution
who
came
every
week
and
whose
wife
was
the
teacher
of
music
they
took
a
great
liking
to
me
and
pointed
out
how
much
better
i
should
be
off
if
i
could
succeed
on
the
stage
of
which
they
had
no
doubt
for
months
i
refused
hoping
still
to
have
some
tidings
of
you
but
at
last
my
drudgery
became
so
insupportable
and
my
means
so
decreased
that
i
unwillingly
consented
it
was
then
nineteen
months
since
i
had
heard
of
you
and
i
mourned
you
as
dead
i
had
no
relations
except
my
uncle
and
i
was
unknown
even
to
him
i
quitted
the
situation
and
took
up
my
abode
with
the
teacher
of
elocution
and
his
wife
who
treated
me
with
every
kindness
and
prepared
me
for
my
new
career
neither
at
the
school
which
was
three
miles
from
london
nor
at
my
new
residence
which
was
over
did
i
ever
see
a
newspaper
it
was
no
wonder
therefore
that
i
did
not
know
of
your
advertisements
after
three
months
preparation
i
was
recommended
and
introduced
to
the
manager
by
my
kind
friends
and
accepted
you
know
the
rest
well
miss
ellen
if
any
one
ever
tells
you
that
you
were
on
the
stage
at
all
events
you
may
reply
that
you
was
there
long
i
trust
not
long
enough
to
be
recognised
replied
she
i
recollect
how
often
i
have
expressed
my
disgust
at
those
who
would
thus
consent
to
exhibit
themselves
but
circumstances
strangely
alter
our
feelings
i
do
however
trust
that
i
should
have
been
respectable
even
as
an
actress
that
you
would
miss
ellen
replied
what
did
i
tell
you
peter
you
pledged
your
honour
that
nothing
would
induce
ellen
to
disgrace
her
family
i
recollect
thank
you
sir
terence
for
your
good
opinion
replied
ellen
my
sister
had
been
with
us
about
three
days
during
which
i
had
informed
her
of
all
that
had
taken
place
when
one
evening
finding
myself
alone
with
her
i
candidly
stated
to
her
what
were
feelings
towards
her
and
pleaded
his
cause
with
all
the
earnestness
in
my
power
my
dear
brother
she
replied
i
have
always
admired
captain
character
and
always
have
felt
grateful
to
him
for
his
kindness
and
attachment
to
you
but
i
can
not
say
that
i
love
him
i
have
never
thought
about
him
except
as
one
to
whom
we
are
both
much
indebted
but
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
could
not
love
him
no
i
do
not
and
i
will
do
all
i
can
peter
i
will
try
i
never
will
if
possible
make
him
unhappy
who
has
been
so
kind
to
you
depend
upon
it
ellen
that
with
your
knowledge
of
and
with
feelings
of
gratitude
to
him
you
will
soon
love
him
if
once
you
accept
him
as
a
suitor
may
i
tell
him
you
may
tell
him
that
he
may
plead
his
own
cause
my
dear
brother
and
at
all
events
i
will
listen
to
no
other
until
he
has
had
fair
play
but
recollect
that
at
present
i
only
him
like
him
much
is
true
but
still
i
only
him
i
was
quite
satisfied
with
my
success
and
so
was
when
i
told
him
by
the
powers
peter
she
an
angel
and
i
ca
expect
her
to
love
an
inferior
being
like
myself
but
if
she
only
like
me
well
enough
to
marry
me
i
trust
to
for
the
rest
love
comes
with
the
children
peter
well
but
you
need
not
say
that
to
her
divil
a
bit
they
shall
come
upon
her
like
old
age
without
her
perceiving
it
having
thus
obtained
permission
certainly
lost
no
time
in
taking
advantage
of
it
celeste
and
i
were
more
fondly
attached
every
day
the
solicitor
declared
my
case
so
good
that
he
could
raise
fifty
thousand
pounds
upon
it
in
short
all
our
causes
were
prosperous
when
an
event
occurred
the
details
of
which
of
course
i
did
not
obtain
until
some
time
afterwards
but
which
i
shall
narrate
here
my
uncle
was
very
much
alarmed
when
he
discovered
that
i
had
been
released
from
bedlam
still
more
so
when
he
had
notice
given
him
of
a
suit
relative
to
the
succession
to
the
title
his
emissaries
had
discovered
that
the
had
been
brought
home
in
frigate
and
was
kept
so
close
that
they
could
not
communicate
with
her
he
now
felt
that
all
his
schemes
would
prove
abortive
his
legal
adviser
was
with
him
and
they
had
been
walking
in
the
garden
talking
over
the
contingencies
when
they
stopped
close
to
the
windows
of
the
mansion
at
eagle
park
but
sir
observed
the
lawyer
if
you
will
not
confide
in
me
i
can
not
act
for
your
benefit
you
still
assert
that
nothing
of
the
kind
has
taken
place
i
do
replied
his
lordship
it
is
a
foul
invention
then
my
lord
may
i
ask
you
why
you
considered
it
advisable
to
imprison
mr
simple
in
bedlam
because
i
hate
him
retorted
his
lordship
detest
him
and
for
what
reason
my
lord
his
character
is
unimpeached
and
he
is
your
near
relative
i
tell
you
sir
that
i
hate
him
would
that
he
were
now
lying
dead
at
my
feet
hardly
were
the
words
out
of
my
uncle
mouth
when
a
whizzing
was
heard
for
a
second
and
then
something
fell
down
within
a
foot
of
where
they
stood
with
a
heavy
crash
they
started
turned
round
the
adopted
heir
lay
lifeless
at
their
feet
and
their
legs
were
bespattered
with
his
blood
and
his
brains
the
poor
boy
seeing
his
lordship
below
had
leaned
out
of
one
of
the
upper
windows
to
call
to
him
but
lost
his
balance
and
had
fallen
head
foremost
upon
the
wide
stone
pavement
which
surrounded
the
mansion
for
a
few
seconds
the
lawyer
and
my
uncle
looked
upon
each
other
with
horror
a
judgment
a
judgment
cried
the
lawyer
looking
at
his
client
my
uncle
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
and
fell
assistance
now
came
out
but
there
was
more
than
one
to
help
up
the
violence
of
his
emotion
had
brought
on
an
apoplectic
fit
and
my
uncle
although
he
breathed
never
spoke
again
it
was
in
consequence
of
this
tragical
event
of
which
we
did
not
know
the
particulars
until
afterwards
that
the
next
morning
my
solicitor
called
upon
me
and
put
a
letter
into
my
hand
saying
allow
me
to
congratulate
your
lordship
we
were
all
at
breakfast
at
the
time
and
the
general
and
myself
jumped
up
all
in
such
astonishment
at
this
unexpected
title
being
so
soon
conferred
upon
me
that
we
had
a
heavy
bill
for
damages
to
pay
and
had
not
ellen
caught
the
as
it
was
tipping
over
there
would
in
all
probability
have
been
a
doctor
bill
into
the
bargain
the
letter
was
eagerly
read
it
was
from
my
uncle
legal
adviser
who
had
witnessed
the
catastrophe
informing
me
that
all
dispute
as
to
the
succession
was
at
an
end
by
the
tragical
event
that
had
taken
place
and
that
he
had
put
seals
upon
everything
awaiting
my
arrival
or
instructions
the
solicitor
as
he
presented
the
letter
said
that
he
would
take
his
leave
and
call
again
in
an
hour
or
two
when
i
was
more
composed
my
first
movement
when
i
had
read
the
letter
aloud
was
to
throw
my
arms
round
celeste
and
embrace
her
and
taking
the
hint
did
the
same
to
ellen
and
was
excused
in
consideration
of
circumstances
but
as
soon
as
she
could
disengage
herself
her
arms
were
entwined
round
my
neck
while
celeste
was
hanging
on
her
father
having
disposed
of
the
ladies
the
gentlemen
now
shook
hands
and
though
we
had
not
all
appetites
to
finish
our
breakfasts
never
was
there
a
happier
quintette
in
about
an
hour
my
solicitor
returned
and
congratulated
me
and
immediately
set
about
the
necessary
preparations
i
desired
him
to
go
down
immediately
to
eagle
park
attend
to
the
funeral
of
my
uncle
and
the
poor
little
boy
who
had
paid
so
dearly
for
his
intended
advancement
and
take
charge
from
my
uncle
legal
adviser
who
remained
in
the
house
the
dreadful
accident
in
high
life
found
its
way
into
the
papers
of
the
day
and
before
dinner
time
a
pile
of
visiting
cards
was
poured
in
which
covered
the
table
the
next
day
a
letter
arrived
from
the
first
lord
announcing
that
he
had
made
out
my
commission
as
and
trusted
that
i
would
allow
him
the
pleasure
of
presenting
it
himself
at
his
dinner
hour
at
seven
very
much
obliged
to
him
the
fool
of
the
family
might
have
waited
a
long
while
for
it
while
i
was
reading
this
letter
the
waiter
came
up
to
say
that
a
young
woman
below
wanted
to
speak
to
me
i
desired
her
to
be
shown
up
as
soon
as
she
came
in
she
burst
into
tears
knelt
down
and
kissed
my
hand
sure
it
you
oh
yes
it
you
that
saved
my
poor
husband
when
i
was
assisting
to
your
ruin
and
a
i
punished
for
my
wicked
doings
my
poor
boy
dead
she
said
no
more
but
remained
on
her
knees
sobbing
bitterly
of
course
the
reader
recognises
in
her
the
who
had
exchanged
her
child
i
raised
her
up
and
desired
her
to
apply
to
my
solicitor
to
pay
her
expenses
and
leave
her
address
but
do
you
forgive
me
mr
simple
it
not
that
i
have
forgiven
myself
i
do
forgive
you
with
all
my
heart
my
good
woman
you
have
been
punished
enough
i
have
indeed
replied
she
sobbing
but
do
i
deserve
it
all
and
more
too
god
blessing
and
all
the
saints
too
upon
your
head
for
your
kind
forgiveness
anyhow
my
heart
is
lighter
and
she
quitted
the
room
she
had
scarcely
quitted
the
hotel
when
the
waiter
came
up
again
another
lady
my
lord
wishes
to
speak
with
you
but
she
wo
give
her
name
really
my
lord
you
seem
to
have
an
extensive
female
acquaintance
said
the
general
at
all
events
i
am
not
aware
of
any
that
i
need
be
ashamed
of
show
the
lady
up
waiter
in
a
moment
entered
a
fat
unwieldly
little
mortal
very
warm
from
walking
she
sat
down
in
a
chair
threw
back
her
tippet
and
then
exclaimed
lord
bless
you
how
you
have
grown
gemini
if
i
can
hardly
believe
my
eyes
and
i
declare
he
do
know
me
i
really
can
not
exactly
recollect
where
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
madam
well
that
what
i
said
to
jemima
when
i
went
down
in
the
kitchen
says
i
wonder
if
little
peter
simple
will
know
me
and
jemima
says
think
he
would
the
parrot
marm
mrs
handycock
i
believe
said
i
recollecting
jemima
and
the
parrot
although
from
a
little
thin
woman
she
had
grown
so
fat
as
not
to
be
recognisable
oh
so
you
found
me
out
mr
simple
my
lord
i
ought
to
say
well
i
need
not
ask
after
your
grandfather
now
for
i
know
he
dead
but
as
i
was
coming
this
way
for
orders
i
thought
i
would
just
step
in
and
see
how
you
looked
i
trust
mr
handycock
is
well
pray
is
he
a
bull
or
a
bear
lord
bless
you
mr
simple
my
lord
i
should
say
he
been
neither
bull
nor
bear
for
this
three
years
he
was
obliged
to
if
i
did
know
much
about
bulls
and
bears
i
know
very
well
what
a
is
to
my
cost
we
off
the
stock
exchange
and
mr
handycock
is
set
up
as
a
coal
merchant
indeed
yes
that
is
we
have
no
coals
but
we
take
orders
and
have
a
chaldron
for
our
trouble
as
mr
handycock
says
it
a
very
good
business
if
you
only
had
enough
of
it
perhaps
your
lordship
may
be
able
to
give
us
an
order
it
nothing
out
of
your
pocket
and
something
into
ours
i
shall
be
very
happy
when
i
return
again
to
town
mrs
handycock
i
hope
the
parrot
is
quite
well
oh
my
lord
that
a
sore
subject
only
think
of
mr
handycock
when
we
retired
from
the
taking
my
parrot
one
day
and
selling
it
for
five
guineas
saying
five
guineas
were
better
than
a
nasty
squalling
bird
to
be
sure
there
was
nothing
for
dinner
that
day
but
as
jemima
agreed
with
me
we
rather
have
gone
without
a
dinner
for
a
month
than
have
parted
with
poll
since
we
looked
up
a
little
in
the
world
i
saved
up
five
guineas
by
hook
or
by
crook
and
tried
to
get
poll
back
again
but
the
lady
said
she
would
take
fifty
guineas
for
him
mrs
handycock
then
jumped
from
her
chair
saying
good
morning
my
lord
i
leave
one
of
mr
handycock
cards
jemima
would
be
so
glad
to
see
you
as
she
left
the
room
celeste
laughingly
asked
me
whether
i
had
any
more
such
acquaintances
i
replied
that
i
believed
not
but
i
must
acknowledge
that
mrs
trotter
was
brought
to
my
recollection
and
i
was
under
some
alarm
lest
she
should
also
come
and
pay
me
her
respects
the
next
day
i
had
another
unexpected
visit
we
had
just
sat
down
to
dinner
when
we
heard
a
disturbance
below
and
shortly
after
the
general
french
servant
came
up
in
great
haste
saying
that
there
was
a
foreigner
below
who
wished
to
see
me
and
that
he
had
been
caning
one
of
the
waiters
of
the
hotel
for
not
paying
him
proper
respect
who
can
that
be
thought
i
and
i
went
out
of
the
door
and
looked
over
the
banisters
as
the
noise
continued
you
must
not
come
here
to
beat
englishmen
i
can
tell
you
roared
one
of
the
waiters
what
do
we
care
for
your
foreign
counts
sacre
canaille
cried
the
other
party
in
a
contemptuous
voice
which
i
well
knew
ay
canal
we
duck
you
in
the
canal
if
you
do
mind
you
will
said
the
stranger
who
had
hitherto
spoken
french
allow
me
to
observe
in
the
most
delicate
manner
in
the
world
just
to
hint
that
you
are
a
d
d
son
of
a
bitch
and
take
this
for
your
impudence
the
noise
of
the
cane
was
again
heard
and
i
hastened
downstairs
where
i
found
count
shucksen
thrashing
two
or
three
of
the
waiters
without
mercy
at
my
appearance
the
waiters
who
were
showing
fight
retreated
to
a
short
distance
out
of
reach
of
the
cane
my
dear
count
exclaimed
i
is
it
you
my
dear
lord
privilege
will
you
excuse
me
but
these
fellows
are
saucy
then
i
have
them
discharged
replied
i
if
a
friend
of
mine
and
an
officer
of
your
rank
and
distinction
can
not
come
to
see
me
without
insult
i
will
seek
another
hotel
this
threat
of
mine
and
the
reception
i
gave
the
count
put
all
to
rights
the
waiters
sneaked
off
and
the
master
of
the
hotel
apologised
it
appeared
that
they
had
desired
him
to
wait
in
the
until
they
could
announce
him
which
had
hurt
the
count
dignity
we
are
just
sitting
down
to
dinner
count
will
you
join
us
as
soon
as
i
have
improved
my
toilet
my
dear
lord
replied
he
you
must
perceive
that
i
am
off
a
journey
the
master
of
the
hotel
bowed
and
proceeded
to
show
the
count
to
a
when
i
returned
upstairs
what
was
the
matter
inquired
oh
nothing
a
little
disturbance
in
consequence
of
a
foreigner
not
understanding
english
in
about
five
minutes
the
waiter
opened
the
door
and
announced
count
shucksen
now
you
be
puzzled
said
i
and
in
came
the
count
my
dear
lord
privilege
said
he
coming
up
and
taking
me
by
the
hand
let
me
not
be
the
last
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
accession
i
was
running
up
the
channel
in
my
frigate
when
a
gave
me
a
newspaper
in
which
i
saw
your
unexpected
change
of
circumstances
i
made
an
excuse
for
dropping
my
anchor
at
spithead
this
morning
and
i
have
come
up
post
to
express
how
sincerely
i
participate
in
your
good
fortune
count
shucksen
then
politely
saluted
the
ladies
and
the
general
and
turned
round
to
who
had
been
staring
at
him
with
astonishment
count
shucksen
allow
me
to
introduce
sir
terence
by
the
piper
that
played
before
moses
but
it
a
puzzle
said
blood
and
thunder
if
it
chucks
my
dear
fellow
when
did
you
rise
from
your
grave
fortunately
replied
the
count
as
they
shook
each
other
hands
for
some
time
i
never
went
into
it
sir
terence
but
now
with
your
permission
my
lord
i
take
some
food
as
i
really
am
not
a
little
hungry
after
dinner
captain
you
shall
hear
my
history
his
secret
was
confided
to
the
whole
party
upon
my
pledging
myself
for
their
keeping
it
locked
up
in
their
own
breasts
which
was
a
bold
thing
on
my
part
considering
that
two
of
them
were
ladies
the
count
stayed
with
us
for
some
time
and
was
introduced
everywhere
it
was
impossible
to
discover
that
he
had
not
been
bred
up
in
a
court
his
manners
were
so
good
he
was
a
great
favourite
with
the
ladies
and
his
moustachios
bad
french
and
waltzing
an
accomplishment
he
had
picked
up
in
sweden
were
quite
the
vogue
all
the
ladies
were
sorry
when
the
swedish
count
announced
his
departure
by
a
before
i
left
town
i
called
upon
the
first
lord
of
the
admiralty
and
procured
for
swinburne
a
building
that
is
to
say
ordered
to
be
built
this
he
had
often
said
he
wished
as
he
was
tired
of
the
sea
after
a
service
of
years
subsequently
i
obtained
leave
of
absence
for
him
every
year
and
he
used
to
make
himself
very
happy
at
eagle
park
most
of
his
time
was
however
passed
on
the
lake
either
fishing
or
rowing
about
telling
long
stories
to
all
who
would
join
him
in
his
water
excursions
a
fortnight
after
my
assuming
my
title
we
set
off
for
eagle
park
and
celeste
consented
to
my
entreaties
that
the
wedding
should
take
place
that
day
month
upon
this
hint
spake
and
to
oblige
ellen
consented
that
we
should
be
united
on
the
same
day
wrote
to
father
but
the
letter
was
returned
by
post
with
marked
upon
the
outside
then
wrote
to
one
of
his
sisters
who
informed
him
that
father
would
cross
the
bog
one
evening
when
he
had
taken
a
very
large
proportion
of
whisky
and
that
he
was
seen
out
of
the
right
path
and
had
never
been
heard
of
afterwards
on
the
day
appointed
we
were
all
united
and
both
unions
have
been
attended
with
as
much
happiness
as
this
world
can
afford
both
and
i
are
blessed
with
children
which
as
observed
have
come
upon
us
like
old
age
until
we
now
can
muster
a
large
christmas
party
in
the
two
families
the
general

sits
and
smiles
happy
in
his
daughter
happiness
and
in
the
gambols
of
his
grandchildren
such
reader
is
the
history
of
peter
simple
viscount
privilege
no
longer
the
fool
but
the
head
of
the
family
who
now
bids
you
farewell
the
end
the
three
cutters
chapter
i
cutter
the
first
reader
have
you
ever
been
at
plymouth
if
you
have
your
eye
must
have
dwelt
with
ecstasy
upon
the
beautiful
property
of
the
earl
of
mount
edgcumbe
if
you
have
not
been
at
plymouth
the
sooner
that
you
go
there
the
better
at
mount
edgcumbe
you
will
behold
the
finest
timber
in
existence
towering
up
to
the
summits
of
the
hills
and
feathering
down
to
the
shingle
on
the
beach
and
from
this
lovely
spot
you
will
witness
one
of
the
most
splendid
panoramas
in
the
world
you
will
see
i
hardly
know
what
you
will
not
see
you
will
see
ram
head
and
cawsand
bay
and
then
you
will
see
the
breakwater
and
drake
island
and
the
devil
bridge
below
you
and
the
town
of
plymouth
and
its
fortifications
and
the
hoe
and
then
you
will
come
to
the
point
round
which
the
tide
runs
devilish
strong
and
then
you
will
see
the
new
victualling
office
about
which
sir
james
gordon
used
to
stump
all
day
and
take
a
pinch
of
snuff
from
every
man
who
carried
a
box
which
all
were
delighted
to
give
and
he
was
delighted
to
receive
proving
how
much
pleasure
may
be
communicated
merely
by
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
then
you
will
see
mount
wise
and
mutton
cove
the
town
of
devonport
with
its
magnificent
dockyard
and
arsenals
north
corner
and
the
way
which
leads
to
saltash
and
you
will
see
ships
building
and
ships
in
ordinary
and
ships
repairing
and
ships
fitting
and
hulks
and
convict
ships
and
the
guardship
ships
ready
to
sail
and
ships
under
sail
besides
lighters
boats
bumboats
and
in
short
there
is
a
great
deal
to
see
at
plymouth
besides
the
sea
itself
but
what
i
particularly
wish
now
is
that
you
will
stand
at
the
battery
of
mount
edgecumbe
and
look
into
barn
pool
below
you
and
there
you
will
see
lying
at
single
anchor
a
cutter
and
you
may
also
see
by
her
pendant
and
ensign
that
she
is
a
yacht
of
all
the
amusements
entered
into
by
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
our
island
there
is
not
one
so
manly
so
exciting
so
patriotic
or
so
national
as
it
is
peculiar
to
england
not
only
from
our
insular
position
and
our
fine
harbours
but
because
it
requires
a
certain
degree
of
energy
and
a
certain
amount
of
income
rarely
to
be
found
elsewhere
it
has
been
wisely
fostered
by
our
sovereigns
who
have
felt
that
the
security
of
the
kingdom
is
increased
by
every
man
being
more
or
less
a
sailor
or
connected
with
the
nautical
profession
it
is
an
amusement
of
the
greatest
importance
to
the
country
as
it
has
much
improved
our
and
our
while
it
affords
employment
to
our
seamen
and
shipwrights
but
if
i
were
to
say
all
that
i
could
say
in
praise
of
yachts
i
should
never
advance
with
my
narrative
i
shall
therefore
drink
a
bumper
to
the
health
of
admiral
lord
yarborough
and
the
yacht
club
and
proceed
you
observe
that
this
yacht
is
and
that
she
sits
gracefully
on
the
smooth
water
she
is
just
heaving
up
her
anchor
her
foresail
is
loose
all
ready
to
cast
her
in
a
few
minutes
she
will
be
under
weigh
you
see
that
there
are
some
ladies
sitting
at
the
taffrail
and
there
are
five
haunches
of
venison
hanging
over
the
stern
of
all
amusements
give
me
yachting
but
we
must
go
on
board
the
deck
you
observe
is
of
narrow
deal
planks
as
white
as
snow
the
guns
are
of
polished
brass
the
bitts
and
binnacles
of
mahogany
she
is
painted
with
taste
and
all
the
mouldings
are
gilded
there
is
nothing
wanting
and
yet
how
clear
and
unencumbered
are
her
decks
let
us
go
below
this
is
the
ladies
cabin
can
anything
be
more
tasteful
or
elegant
is
it
not
luxurious
and
although
so
small
does
not
its
very
confined
space
astonish
you
when
you
view
so
many
comforts
so
beautifully
arranged
this
is
the
and
where
the
gentlemen
repair
what
can
be
more
complete
or
and
just
peep
into
their
and
here
is
the
steward
room
and
the
beaufet
the
steward
is
squeezing
lemons
for
the
punch
and
there
is
the
champagne
in
ice
and
by
the
side
of
the
pail
the
are
ranged
up
all
ready
now
let
us
go
forwards
here
are
the
men
berths
not
confined
as
in
a
no
luxury
starts
from
abaft
and
is
not
wholly
lost
even
at
the
this
is
the
kitchen
is
it
not
admirably
arranged
what
a
in
and
how
delightful
are
the
fumes
of
the
at
sea
we
do
meet
with
rough
weather
at
times
but
for
roughing
it
out
give
me
a
now
that
i
have
shown
you
round
the
vessel
i
must
introduce
the
parties
on
board
you
observe
that
florid
handsome
man
in
white
trousers
and
blue
jacket
who
has
a
telescope
in
one
hand
and
is
sipping
a
glass
of
brandy
and
water
which
he
has
just
taken
off
the
skylight
that
is
the
owner
of
the
vessel
and
a
member
of
the
yacht
club
it
is
lord
b
he
looks
like
a
sailor
and
he
does
not
much
belie
his
looks
yet
i
have
seen
him
in
his
robes
of
state
at
the
opening
of
the
house
of
lords
the
one
near
to
him
is
mr
stewart
a
lieutenant
in
the
navy
he
holds
on
by
the
rigging
with
one
hand
because
having
been
actively
employed
all
his
life
he
does
not
know
what
to
do
with
hands
which
have
nothing
in
them
he
is
of
lord
and
is
now
on
board
as
of
the
yacht
that
handsome
man
who
is
standing
by
the
binnacle
is
a
mr
hautaine
he
served
six
years
as
midshipman
in
the
navy
and
did
not
like
it
he
then
served
six
years
in
a
cavalry
regiment
and
did
not
like
it
he
then
married
and
in
a
much
shorter
probation
found
that
he
did
not
like
that
but
he
is
very
fond
of
yachts
and
other
men
wives
if
he
does
not
like
his
own
and
wherever
he
goes
he
is
welcome
that
young
man
with
an
embroidered
silk
waistcoat
and
white
gloves
bending
to
talk
to
one
of
the
ladies
is
a
mr
vaughan
he
is
to
be
seen
at
almack
at
crockford
and
everywhere
else
everybody
knows
him
and
he
knows
everybody
he
is
a
little
in
debt
and
yachting
is
convenient
the
one
who
sits
by
the
lady
is
a
relation
of
lord
you
see
at
once
what
he
is
he
apes
the
sailor
he
has
not
shaved
because
sailors
have
no
time
to
shave
every
day
he
has
not
changed
his
linen
because
sailors
can
not
change
every
day
he
has
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
which
makes
him
half
sick
and
annoys
his
company
he
talks
of
the
pleasure
of
a
rough
sea
which
will
drive
all
the
ladies
below
and
then
they
will
not
perceive
that
he
is
more
sick
than
themselves
he
has
the
misfortune
to
be
born
to
a
large
estate
and
to
be
a
his
name
is
ossulton
the
last
of
the
gentlemen
on
board
whom
i
have
to
introduce
is
mr
seagrove
he
is
slightly
made
with
marked
features
full
of
intelligence
he
has
been
brought
up
to
the
bar
and
has
every
qualification
but
application
he
has
never
had
a
brief
nor
has
he
a
chance
of
one
he
is
the
fiddler
of
the
company
and
he
has
locked
up
his
chambers
and
come
by
invitation
of
his
lordship
to
play
on
board
of
his
yacht
i
have
yet
to
describe
the
ladies
perhaps
i
should
have
commenced
with
them
i
must
excuse
myself
upon
the
principle
of
reserving
the
best
to
the
last
all
do
so
and
what
is
this
but
the
first
scene
in
my
we
will
describe
them
according
to
seniority
that
tall
thin
lady
of
is
a
spinster
and
sister
to
lord
b
she
has
been
persuaded
very
much
against
her
will
to
come
on
board
but
her
notions
of
propriety
would
not
permit
her
niece
to
embark
under
the
protection
of
her
father
she
is
frightened
at
everything
if
a
rope
is
thrown
down
on
the
deck
up
she
starts
and
cries
oh
if
on
the
deck
she
thinks
the
water
is
rushing
in
below
if
down
below
and
there
is
a
noise
she
is
convinced
there
is
danger
and
if
it
be
perfectly
still
she
is
sure
there
is
something
wrong
she
fidgets
herself
and
everybody
and
is
quite
a
nuisance
with
her
pride
and
but
she
has
strict
notions
of
propriety
and
sacrifices
herself
as
a
martyr
she
is
the
hon
miss
ossulton
the
lady
who
when
she
smiles
shows
so
many
dimples
in
her
pretty
oval
face
is
a
young
widow
of
the
name
of
lascelles
she
married
an
old
man
to
please
her
father
and
mother
which
was
very
dutiful
on
her
part
she
was
rewarded
by
finding
herself
a
widow
with
a
large
fortune
having
married
the
first
time
to
please
her
parents
she
intends
now
to
marry
to
please
herself
but
she
is
very
young
and
is
in
no
hurry
the
young
lady
with
such
a
sweet
expression
of
countenance
is
the
hon
miss
cecilia
ossulton
she
is
lively
witty
and
has
no
fear
in
her
composition
but
she
is
very
young
yet
not
more
than
seventeen
and
nobody
knows
what
she
really
is
she
does
not
know
herself
these
are
the
parties
who
meet
in
the
cabin
of
the
yacht
the
crew
consists
of
ten
fine
seamen
the
steward
and
the
cook
there
is
also
lord
b
valet
mr
ossulton
gentleman
and
the
lady
maid
of
miss
ossulton
there
not
being
accommodation
for
them
the
other
servants
have
been
left
on
shore
the
yacht
is
now
under
weigh
and
her
sails
are
all
set
she
is
running
between
drake
island
and
the
main
dinner
has
been
announced
as
the
reader
has
learnt
something
about
the
preparations
i
leave
him
to
judge
whether
it
be
not
very
pleasant
to
sit
down
to
dinner
in
a
yacht
the
air
has
given
everybody
an
appetite
and
it
was
not
until
the
cloth
was
removed
that
the
conversation
became
general
mr
seagrove
said
his
lordship
you
very
nearly
lost
your
passage
i
expected
you
last
thursday
i
am
sorry
my
lord
that
business
prevented
my
sooner
attending
to
your
lordship
kind
summons
come
seagrove
do
be
nonsensical
said
hautaine
you
told
me
yourself
the
other
evening
when
you
were
talkative
that
you
had
never
had
a
brief
in
your
life
and
a
very
fortunate
circumstance
replied
seagrove
for
if
i
had
had
a
brief
i
should
not
have
known
what
to
have
done
with
it
it
is
not
my
fault
i
am
fit
for
nothing
but
a
commissioner
but
still
i
had
business
and
very
important
business
too
i
was
summoned
by
ponsonby
to
go
with
him
to
tattersall
to
give
my
opinion
about
a
horse
he
wishes
to
purchase
and
then
to
attend
him
to
forest
wild
to
plead
his
cause
with
his
uncle
it
appears
then
that
you
were
retained
replied
lord
may
i
ask
you
whether
your
friend
gained
his
cause
no
my
lord
he
lost
his
cause
but
he
gained
a
suit
expound
your
riddle
sir
said
cecilia
ossulton
the
fact
is
that
old
ponsonby
is
very
anxious
that
william
should
marry
miss
percival
whose
estates
join
on
to
forest
wild
now
my
friend
william
is
about
as
fond
of
marriage
as
i
am
of
law
and
thereby
issue
was
joined
but
why
were
you
to
be
called
in
inquired
mrs
lascelles
because
madam
as
ponsonby
never
buys
a
horse
without
consulting
me
i
can
not
see
the
analogy
sir
observed
miss
ossulton
senior
bridling
up
pardon
me
madam
the
fact
is
continued
seagrove
that
as
i
always
have
to
back
ponsonby
horses
he
thought
it
right
that
in
this
instance
i
should
back
him
he
required
special
pleading
but
his
uncle
tried
him
for
the
capital
offence
and
he
was
not
allowed
counsel
as
soon
as
we
arrived
and
i
had
bowed
myself
into
the
room
mr
ponsonby
bowed
me
out
again
which
would
have
been
infinitely
more
jarring
to
my
feelings
had
not
the
door
been
left
do
anything
but
pun
seagrove
interrupted
hautaine
well
then
i
will
take
a
glass
of
wine
do
so
said
his
lordship
but
recollect
the
whole
company
are
impatient
for
your
story
i
can
assure
you
my
lord
that
it
was
equal
to
any
scene
in
a
comedy
now
be
it
observed
that
mr
seagrove
had
a
great
deal
of
comic
talent
he
was
an
excellent
mimic
and
could
alter
his
voice
almost
as
he
pleased
it
was
a
custom
of
his
to
act
a
scene
as
between
other
people
and
he
performed
it
remarkably
well
whenever
he
said
that
anything
he
was
going
to
narrate
was
as
good
as
a
comedy
it
was
generally
understood
by
those
who
were
acquainted
with
him
that
he
was
to
be
asked
so
to
do
cecilia
ossulton
therefore
immediately
said
pray
act
it
mr
seagrove
upon
which
mr
seagrove
premising
that
he
had
not
only
heard
but
also
seen
all
that
passed
changing
his
voice
and
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
commenced
it
may
said
he
be
called
five
thousand
acres
in
a
we
shall
not
describe
mr
seagrove
motions
they
must
be
inferred
from
his
words
will
then
william
observed
mr
ponsonby
stopping
and
turning
to
his
nephew
after
a
rapid
walk
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
him
under
his
coat
so
as
to
allow
the
tails
to
drop
their
perpendicular
about
three
inches
clear
of
his
body
may
say
without
contradiction
be
the
finest
property
in
the
county
five
thousand
acres
in
a
dare
say
it
will
uncle
replied
william
tapping
his
foot
as
he
lounged
in
a
green
morocco
so
because
you
have
set
your
fancy
upon
having
these
two
estates
enclosed
together
in
a
you
wish
that
i
should
also
be
enclosed
in
a
a
beautiful
property
it
will
be
replied
mr
ponsonby
uncle
the
estate
or
the
wife
nephew
both
and
i
expect
your
consent
i
am
not
avaricious
your
present
property
is
sufficient
for
me
with
your
permission
instead
of
doubling
the
property
and
doubling
myself
i
will
remain
your
sole
heir
and
single
william
such
an
opportunity
may
not
occur
again
for
centuries
we
shall
restore
forest
wild
to
its
ancient
boundaries
you
know
it
has
been
divided
nearly
two
hundred
years
we
now
have
a
glorious
golden
opportunity
of
the
two
properties
and
when
joined
the
estate
will
be
exactly
what
it
was
when
granted
to
our
ancestors
by
henry
the
eighth
at
the
period
of
the
reformation
this
house
must
be
pulled
down
and
the
monastery
left
standing
then
we
shall
have
our
own
again
and
the
property
without
encumbrance
encumbrance
uncle
you
forget
that
there
will
be
a
wife
you
forget
that
there
will
be
five
thousand
acres
in
a
uncle
you
ring
it
too
often
in
my
ears
that
i
should
forget
it
but
much
as
i
should
like
to
be
the
happy
possessor
of
such
a
property
i
do
not
feel
inclined
to
be
the
happy
possessor
of
miss
percival
and
the
more
so
as
i
have
never
seen
the
property
will
ride
over
it
william
over
miss
percival
uncle
that
will
not
be
very
gallant
i
will
however
one
of
these
days
ride
over
the
property
with
you
which
as
well
as
miss
percival
i
have
not
as
yet
seen
i
can
tell
you
she
is
a
very
pretty
property
she
were
not
in
a
good
heart
william
that
is
i
mean
an
excellent
disposition
in
matrimony
well
tilled
i
should
say
by
her
thee
maiden
aunts
who
are
the
patterns
of
propriety
any
one
follow
the
fashion
a
high
state
of
cultivation
that
is
her
mind
highly
cultivated
and
according
to
the
last
new
system
what
is
it
shift
i
presume
replied
william
laughing
is
dancing
singing
music
and
drawing
only
seventeen
capital
soil
promising
good
crops
what
would
you
have
more
very
pretty
estate
uncle
if
it
were
not
the
estate
of
matrimony
i
am
sorry
very
sorry
to
disappoint
you
but
i
must
decline
taking
a
lease
of
it
for
life
sir
allow
me
to
hint
to
you
that
in
my
testament
you
are
only
i
consider
it
a
duty
that
i
owe
to
the
family
that
the
estate
should
be
that
can
only
be
done
by
one
of
our
family
marrying
miss
percival
and
as
you
will
not
i
shall
now
write
to
your
cousin
james
and
if
he
accept
my
proposal
shall
make
my
heir
probably
he
will
more
fully
appreciate
the
advantages
of
five
thousand
acres
in
a
and
mr
ponsonby
directed
his
steps
towards
the
door
my
dear
uncle
cried
william
rising
up
from
his
do
not
quite
understand
one
another
it
is
very
true
that
i
would
prefer
half
the
property
and
remaining
single
to
the
two
estates
and
the
estate
of
marriage
but
at
the
same
time
i
did
not
tell
you
that
i
would
prefer
beggary
to
a
wife
and
five
thousand
acres
in
a
i
know
you
to
be
a
man
of
your
word
i
accept
your
proposal
and
you
need
not
put
my
cousin
james
to
the
expense
of
postage
good
william
i
require
no
more
and
as
i
know
you
to
be
a
man
of
your
word
i
shall
consider
this
match
as
settled
it
was
on
this
account
only
that
i
sent
for
you
and
now
you
may
go
back
again
as
soon
as
you
please
i
will
let
you
know
when
all
is
ready
must
be
at
tattersall
on
monday
uncle
there
is
a
horse
i
must
have
for
next
season
pray
uncle
may
i
ask
when
you
are
likely
to
want
me
me
see
this
is
may
about
july
i
should
think
uncle
spare
me
i
can
not
marry
in
the
no
hang
it
not
july
william
perhaps
as
you
must
come
down
once
or
twice
to
see
the
property
miss
percival
i
should
say
it
may
be
too
soon
suppose
we
put
it
off
till
october
i
shall
be
down
at
melton
sir
may
i
then
inquire
what
portion
of
the
year
is
not
with
you
uncle
next
april
now
i
think
that
would
do
april
eleven
months
and
a
winter
between
suppose
miss
percival
was
to
take
a
cold
and
die
should
be
excessively
obliged
to
her
thought
william
no
continued
mr
ponsonby
is
nothing
certain
in
this
world
william
then
uncle
suppose
we
arrange
it
for
the
first
have
had
no
hard
frosts
lately
we
may
wait
for
the
sooner
it
is
over
the
go
back
to
town
buy
your
horse
and
then
come
down
here
my
dear
william
to
oblige
your
uncle
never
mind
the
sir
if
i
am
to
make
a
sacrifice
it
shall
not
be
done
by
halves
out
of
respect
for
you
i
will
even
marry
in
july
without
any
regard
to
the
thermometer
are
a
good
boy
do
you
want
a
cheque

had
one
thought
william
and
was
almost
at
fault

be
most
thankful
sir
they
sell
by
the
ounce
you
pay
in
there
william
you
sir
i
all
obedience
and
i
keep
my
word
even
if
there
should
be
a
comet
i
go
and
buy
the
horse
and
then
i
shall
be
ready
to
take
the
as
soon
as
you
please
and
you
get
over
it
cleverly
i
no
five
thousand
acres
william
and
a
pretty
wife

any
further
commands
uncle
said
william
depositing
the
cheque
in
his
my
dear
boy
are
you
going
sir
i
dine
at
the
clarendon
then
make
my
compliments
and
excuses
to
your
friend
you
will
come
on
tuesday
or
wednesday
thus
was
concluded
the
marriage
between
william
ponsonby
and
emily
percival
and
the
junction
of
the
two
estates
which
formed
together
the
great
desideratum
thousand
acres
in
a
mr
seagrove
finished
and
he
looked
round
for
approbation
very
good
indeed
seagrove
said
his
lordship
you
must
take
a
glass
of
wine
after
that
i
would
not
give
much
for
miss
percival
chance
of
happiness
observed
the
elder
miss
ossulton
of
two
evils
choose
the
least
they
say
observed
mr
hautaine
poor
ponsonby
could
not
help
himself
that
a
very
polite
observation
of
yours
mr
hautaine
i
thank
you
in
the
name
of
the
sex
replied
cecilia
ossulton
nay
miss
ossulton
would
you
like
to
marry
a
person
whom
you
never
saw
most
certainly
not
but
when
you
mentioned
the
two
evils
mr
hautaine
i
appeal
to
your
honour
did
you
not
refer
to
marriage
or
beggary
i
must
confess
it
miss
ossulton
but
it
is
hardly
fair
to
call
on
my
honour
to
get
me
into
a
scrape
i
only
wish
that
the
offer
had
been
made
to
me
observed
vaughan
i
should
not
have
hesitated
as
ponsonby
did
then
i
beg
you
will
not
think
of
proposing
for
me
said
mrs
lascelles
laughing
for
mr
vaughan
had
been
excessively
attentive
it
appears
to
me
vaughan
observed
seagrove
that
you
have
slightly
committed
yourself
by
that
remark
vaughan
who
thought
so
too
replied
mrs
lascelles
must
be
aware
that
i
was
only
joking
fie
mr
vaughan
cried
cecilia
ossulton
you
know
it
came
from
your
heart
my
dear
cecilia
said
the
elder
miss
ossulton
you
forget
yourself
what
can
you
possibly
know
about
gentlemen
hearts
the
bible
says
they
are
deceitful
and
desperately
wicked
aunt
and
can
not
we
also
quote
the
bible
against
your
sex
miss
ossulton
replied
seagrove
yes
you
could
perhaps
if
any
of
you
had
ever
read
it
replied
miss
ossulton
carelessly
upon
my
word
cissy
you
are
throwing
the
gauntlet
down
to
the
gentlemen
observed
lord
but
i
shall
throw
my
warder
down
and
not
permit
this
combat
i
perceive
you
drink
no
more
wine
gentlemen
we
will
take
our
coffee
on
deck
we
were
just
about
to
retire
my
lord
observed
the
elder
miss
ossulton
with
great
asperity
i
have
been
trying
to
catch
the
eye
of
mrs
lascelles
for
some
time
but
i
was
looking
another
way
i
presume
interrupted
mrs
lascelles
smiling
i
am
afraid
that
i
am
the
unfortunate
culprit
said
mr
seagrove
i
was
telling
a
little
anecdote
to
mrs
lascelles
which
of
course
from
its
being
communicated
in
an
undertone
was
not
proper
for
all
the
company
to
hear
replied
the
elder
miss
ossulton
but
if
mrs
lascelles
is
now
ready
continued
she
bridling
up
as
she
rose
from
her
chair
at
all
events
i
can
hear
the
remainder
of
it
on
deck
replied
mrs
lascelles
the
ladies
rose
and
went
into
the
cabin
cecilia
and
mrs
lascelles
exchanging
very
significant
smiles
as
they
followed
the
precise
spinster
who
did
not
choose
that
mrs
lascelles
should
take
the
lead
merely
because
she
had
once
happened
to
have
been
the
gentlemen
also
broke
up
and
went
on
deck
we
have
a
nice
breeze
now
my
lord
observed
mr
stewart
who
had
remained
on
deck
and
we
lie
right
up
channel
so
much
the
better
replied
his
lordship
we
ought
to
have
been
anchored
at
cowes
a
week
ago
they
will
all
be
there
before
us
tell
mr
simpson
to
bring
me
a
light
for
my
cigar
said
mr
ossulton
to
one
of
the
men
mr
stewart
went
down
to
his
dinner
the
ladies
and
the
coffee
came
on
deck
the
breeze
was
fine
the
weather
it
was
april
almost
warm
and
the
yacht
whose
name
was
the
assisted
by
the
tide
soon
left
the
mewstone
far
astern
chapter
ii
cutter
the
second
reader
have
you
ever
been
at
portsmouth
if
you
have
you
must
have
been
delighted
with
the
view
from
the
saluting
battery
and
if
you
have
not
you
had
better
go
there
as
soon
as
you
can
from
the
saluting
battery
you
may
look
up
the
harbour
and
see
much
of
what
i
have
described
at
plymouth
the
scenery
is
different
but
similar
arsenals
and
dockyards
and
an
equal
portion
of
our
stupendous
navy
are
to
be
found
and
you
will
see
gosport
on
the
other
side
of
the
harbour
and
sally
port
close
to
you
besides
a
great
many
other
places
which
from
the
saluting
battery
you
can
not
see
and
then
there
is
southsea
beach
to
your
left
before
you
spithead
with
the
and
the
motherbank
crowded
with
merchant
vessels
and
there
is
the
buoy
where
the
was
wrecked
and
where
she
still
lies
the
fish
swimming
in
and
out
of
her
cabin
windows
but
that
is
not
all
you
can
also
see
the
isle
of
wight
ryde
with
its
long
wooden
pier
and
cowes
where
the
yachts
lie
in
fact
there
is
a
great
deal
to
be
seen
at
portsmouth
as
well
as
at
plymouth
but
what
i
wish
you
particularly
to
see
just
now
is
a
vessel
holding
fast
to
the
buoy
just
off
the
saluting
battery
she
is
a
cutter
and
you
may
know
that
she
belongs
to
the
preventive
service
by
the
number
of
gigs
and
galleys
which
she
has
hoisted
up
all
round
her
she
looks
like
a
vessel
that
was
about
to
sail
with
a
cargo
of
boats
two
on
deck
one
astern
one
on
each
side
of
her
you
observe
that
she
is
painted
black
and
all
her
boats
are
white
she
is
not
such
an
elegant
vessel
as
the
yacht
and
she
is
much
more
lumbered
up
she
has
no
haunches
of
venison
over
the
stern
but
i
think
there
is
a
leg
of
mutton
and
some
cabbages
hanging
by
their
stalks
but
are
not
you
will
find
no
turtle
or
champagne
but
nevertheless
you
will
perhaps
find
a
joint
to
carve
at
a
good
glass
of
grog
and
a
hearty
welcome
let
us
go
on
you
observe
the
guns
are
iron
and
painted
black
and
her
bulwarks
are
painted
red
it
is
not
a
very
becoming
colour
but
then
it
lasts
a
long
while
and
the
is
not
very
generous
on
the
score
of
paint
or
lieutenants
of
the
navy
troubled
with
much
spare
cash
she
has
plenty
of
men
and
fine
men
they
are
all
dressed
in
red
flannel
shirts
and
blue
trousers
some
of
them
have
not
taken
off
their
canvas
or
tarpaulin
petticoats
which
are
very
useful
to
them
as
they
are
in
the
boats
night
and
day
and
in
all
weathers
but
we
will
at
once
go
down
into
the
cabin
where
we
shall
find
the
lieutenant
who
commands
her
a
master
mate
and
a
midshipman
they
have
each
their
tumbler
before
them
and
are
drinking
hot
with
sugar
capital
gin
too
proof
it
is
from
that
small
anker
standing
under
the
table
it
was
one
that
they
forgot
to
return
to
the
when
they
made
their
last
seizure
we
must
introduce
them
the
elderly
personage
with
grizzly
hair
and
whiskers
a
round
pale
face
and
a
somewhat
red
nose
being
too
much
in
the
wind
will
make
the
nose
red
and
this
old
officer
is
very
often
in
the
wind
of
course
from
the
very
nature
of
his
profession
is
a
lieutenant
appleboy
he
has
served
in
every
class
of
vessel
in
the
service
and
done
the
duty
of
first
lieutenant
for
twenty
years
he
is
now
on
promotion
that
is
to
say
after
he
has
taken
a
certain
number
of
tubs
of
gin
he
will
be
rewarded
with
his
rank
as
commander
it
is
a
pity
that
what
he
takes
inside
of
him
does
not
count
for
he
takes
it
morning
noon
and
night
he
is
just
filling
his
fourteenth
glass
he
always
keeps
a
regular
account
as
he
never
exceeds
his
limited
number
which
is
seventeen
then
he
is
exactly
down
to
his
bearings
the
master
mate
name
is
tomkins
he
has
served
his
six
years
three
times
over
and
has
now
outgrown
his
ambition
which
is
fortunate
for
him
as
his
chances
of
promotion
are
small
he
prefers
a
small
vessel
to
a
large
one
because
he
is
not
obliged
to
be
so
particular
in
his
dress
and
looks
for
his
lieutenancy
whenever
there
shall
be
another
charity
promotion
he
is
fond
of
soft
bread
for
his
teeth
are
all
absent
without
leave
he
prefers
porter
to
any
other
liquor
but
he
can
drink
his
glass
of
grog
whether
it
be
based
upon
rum
brandy
or
the
liquor
now
before
him
mr
smith
is
the
name
of
that
young
gentleman
whose
jacket
is
so
out
at
the
elbows
he
has
been
intending
to
mend
it
these
last
two
months
but
is
too
lazy
to
go
to
his
chest
for
another
he
has
been
turned
out
of
half
the
ships
in
the
service
for
laziness
but
he
was
born
so
and
therefore
it
is
not
his
a
suits
him
she
is
half
her
time
hove
to
and
he
has
no
objection
to
as
he
sits
down
always
in
the
which
is
not
fatiguing
creeping
for
tubs
is
his
delight
as
he
gets
over
so
little
ground
he
is
fond
of
grog
but
there
is
some
trouble
in
carrying
the
tumbler
so
often
to
his
mouth
so
he
looks
at
it
and
lets
it
stand
he
says
little
because
he
is
too
lazy
to
speak
he
has
served
more
than
years
as
for
passing
it
has
never
come
into
his
head
such
are
the
three
persons
who
are
now
sitting
in
the
cabin
of
the
drinking
hot
let
me
see
it
was
i
think
in
or
before
you
were
in
the
service
maybe
sir
it
so
long
ago
since
i
entered
that
i
ca
recollect
dates
but
this
i
know
that
my
aunt
died
three
days
before
then
the
question
is
when
did
your
aunt
die
oh
she
died
about
a
year
after
my
uncle
and
when
did
your
uncle
die
i
be
hanged
if
i
know
then
d
see
you
no
departure
to
work
from
however
i
think
you
can
not
have
been
in
the
service
at
that
time
we
were
not
quite
so
particular
about
uniform
as
we
are
now
then
i
think
the
service
was
all
the
better
for
it
in
your
crack
ships
a
mate
has
to
go
down
in
the
hold
or
and
after
whipping
up
fifty
empty
casks
and
breaking
out
twenty
full
ones
he
is
expected
to
come
on
as
clean
as
if
he
was
just
come
out
of
a
well
there
plenty
of
water
alongside
as
far
as
the
outward
man
goes
and
iron
dust
is
soon
brushed
off
however
as
you
say
perhaps
a
little
too
much
is
expected
at
least
in
five
of
the
ships
in
which
i
was
the
captain
was
always
hauling
me
over
the
coals
about
the
midshipmen
not
dressing
properly
as
if
i
was
their
i
wonder
what
captain
prigg
would
have
said
if
he
had
seen
such
a
as
you
mr
smith
on
his
i
should
have
had
one
more
drawled
smith
with
your
jacket
there
heh
continued
mr
appleboy
smith
turned
up
his
elbows
looked
at
one
and
then
at
the
other
after
so
fatiguing
an
operation
he
was
silent
well
where
was
i
oh
it
was
about
or
as
i
said
that
it
happened
tomkins
fill
your
glass
and
hand
me
the
sugar
how
do
i
get
on
this
is
no
said
appleboy
counting
some
white
lines
on
the
table
by
him
and
taking
up
a
piece
of
chalk
he
marked
one
more
line
on
his
tally
i
do
think
this
is
so
good
a
tub
as
the
last
tomkins
there
a
twang
about
it
a
want
of
juniper
however
i
hope
we
shall
have
better
luck
this
time
of
course
you
know
we
sail
i
presume
so
by
the
leg
of
mutton
coming
on
board
true
true
i
regular
as
after
being
twenty
years
a
one
gets
a
little
method
i
like
regularity
now
the
admiral
has
never
omitted
asking
me
to
dinner
once
every
time
i
have
come
into
harbour
except
this
time
i
was
so
certain
of
it
that
i
never
expected
to
sail
and
i
have
but
two
shirts
clean
in
consequence
that
odd
is
it
and
the
more
so
because
he
has
had
such
great
people
down
here
and
has
been
giving
large
parties
every
day
and
yet
i
made
three
seizures
besides
sweeping
up
those
tubs
i
swept
them
up
observed
smith
that
all
the
same
thing
when
you
been
a
little
longer
in
the
service
you
find
out
that
the
commanding
officer
has
the
merit
of
all
that
is
done
but
you
yet
let
me
see
where
was
i
oh
it
was
about
or
as
i
said
at
that
time
i
was
in
the
channel
fleet
tomkins
i
trouble
you
for
the
hot
water
this
water
mr
smith
do
me
the
favour
to
ring
the
bell
jem
some
more
hot
water
please
sir
said
jem
who
was
barefooted
as
well
as
touching
the
lock
of
hair
on
his
forehead
the
cook
has
capsized
the
kettle
but
he
has
put
more
on
capsized
the
kettle
ha
very
well
we
talk
about
that
mr
tomkins
do
me
the
favour
to
put
him
in
the
report
i
may
forget
it
and
pray
sir
how
long
is
it
since
he
has
put
more
on
just
this
moment
sir
as
i
came
aft
very
well
we
see
to
that
you
bring
the
kettle
aft
as
soon
as
it
is
ready
i
say
mr
jem
is
that
fellow
sober
yees
sir
he
be
sober
as
you
be
it
quite
astonishing
what
a
propensity
the
common
sailors
have
to
liquor
forty
odd
years
have
i
been
in
the
service
and
i
never
found
any
difference
i
only
wish
i
had
a
guinea
for
every
time
that
i
have
given
a
fellow
grog
during
my
servitude
as
i
would
call
the
king
my
cousin
well
if
there
no
hot
water
we
must
take
lukewarm
it
wo
do
to
heave
to
by
the
lord
harry
who
would
have
thought
it
i
at
number
sixteen
let
me
count
yes
surely
i
must
have
made
a
mistake
a
fact
by
heaven
continued
mr
appleboy
throwing
the
chalk
down
on
the
table
only
one
more
glass
after
this
that
is
if
i
have
counted
right
i
may
have
seen
double
yes
drawled
smith
well
never
mind
let
go
on
with
my
it
was
either
in
the
year
or
that
i
was
in
the
channel
fleet
we
were
then
abreast
of
torbay
here
be
the
hot
water
sir
cried
jem
putting
the
kettle
down
on
the
deck
very
well
boy
has
the
jar
of
butter
come
on
board
yes
but
it
broke
all
down
the
middle
i
tied
him
up
with
a
ropeyarn
who
broke
it
sir
coxswain
says
as
how
he
did
but
who
did
sir
coxswain
handed
it
up
to
bill
jones
and
he
says
as
how
he
did
but
who
did
sir
bill
jones
gave
it
to
me
and
i
sure
as
how
i
did
then
who
did
sir
i
ask
you
i
think
it
be
bill
jones
sir
he
fond
of
butter
i
know
and
there
be
very
little
left
in
the
jar
very
we
see
to
that
morning
mr
tomkins
oblige
me
by
putting
the
down
in
the
report
in
case
it
should
slip
my
memory
bill
jones
indeed
looks
as
if
butter
melt
in
his
mouth
never
mind
well
it
was
as
i
said
before
it
was
in
the
year
or
when
i
was
in
the
channel
fleet
we
were
then
off
torbay
and
had
just
taken
two
reefs
in
the
stop
before
i
go
on
with
my
story
i
take
my
last
glass
i
think
it
the
last
let
me
count
yes
by
heavens
i
make
out
sixteen
well
told
never
mind
it
shall
be
a
stiff
one
boy
bring
the
kettle
and
mind
you
do
pour
the
hot
water
into
my
shoes
as
you
did
the
other
night
there
that
will
do
now
tomkins
fill
up
yours
and
you
mr
smith
let
us
all
start
fair
and
then
you
shall
have
my
story
and
a
very
curious
one
it
is
i
can
tell
you
i
would
have
believed
it
myself
if
i
had
seen
it
hilloa
what
this
confound
it
what
the
matter
with
the
toddy
heh
mr
tomkins
mr
tomkins
tasted
but
like
the
lieutenant
he
had
made
it
very
stiff
and
as
he
had
also
taken
largely
before
he
was
like
him
not
quite
so
clear
in
his
discrimination
it
has
a
queer
sir
smith
what
is
it
smith
took
up
his
glass
tasted
the
contents
water
the
midshipman
salt
water
so
it
is
by
heavens
cried
mr
appleboy
salt
as
lot
wife
by
all
that
infamous
cried
the
master
mate
salt
water
sir
cried
jem
in
a
fright
expecting
a
eel
for
supper
yes
sir
replied
mr
appleboy
tossing
the
contents
of
the
tumbler
in
the
boy
face
salt
water
very
well
sir
very
well
it
war
me
sir
replied
the
boy
making
up
a
piteous
look
no
sir
but
you
said
the
cook
was
sober
he
was
not
so
much
disguised
sir
replied
jem
oh
very
well
never
mind
mr
tomkins
in
case
i
should
forget
it
do
me
the
favour
to
put
the
kettle
of
salt
water
down
in
the
report
the
scoundrel
i
very
sorry
gentlemen
but
there
no
means
of
having
any
more
but
never
mind
we
see
to
this
two
can
play
at
this
and
if
i
do
their
grog
and
make
them
drink
it
too
i
have
been
twenty
years
a
for
nothing
all
good
night
gentlemen
and
continued
the
lieutenant
in
a
severe
tone
you
keep
a
sharp
mr
smith
do
you
hear
sir
yes
drawled
smith
but
it
not
my
watch
it
was
my
first
watch
and
just
now
it
struck
one
bell
you
keep
the
middle
watch
then
mr
smith
said
mr
appleboy
who
was
not
a
little
put
out
and
mr
tomkins
let
me
know
as
soon
as
daylight
boy
get
my
bed
made
salt
water
by
all
that
blue
however
we
see
to
that
morning
mr
appleboy
then
turned
in
so
did
mr
tomkins
and
so
did
mr
smith
who
had
no
idea
of
keeping
the
middle
watch
because
the
cook
was
drunk
and
had
filled
up
the
kettle
with
salt
water
as
for
what
happened
in
or
i
really
would
inform
the
reader
if
i
knew
but
i
am
afraid
that
that
most
curious
story
is
never
to
be
handed
down
to
posterity
the
next
morning
mr
tomkins
as
usual
forgot
to
report
the
cook
the
jar
of
butter
and
the
kettle
of
salt
water
and
mr
appleboy
wrath
had
long
been
appeased
before
he
remembered
them
at
daylight
the
lieutenant
came
on
deck
having
only
slept
away
half
of
the
sixteen
and
a
taste
of
the
seventeenth
glass
of
he
rubbed
his
grey
eyes
that
he
might
peer
through
the
grey
of
the
morning
the
fresh
breeze
blew
about
his
grizzly
locks
and
cooled
his
rubicund
nose
the
whose
name
was
the
cast
off
from
the
buoy
and
with
a
fresh
breeze
steered
her
course
for
the
needles
passage
chapter
iii
cutter
the
third
reader
have
you
been
to
st
maloes
if
you
have
you
were
glad
enough
to
leave
the
hole
and
if
you
have
not
take
my
advice
and
do
not
give
yourself
the
trouble
to
go
and
see
that
or
any
other
french
port
in
the
channel
there
is
not
one
worth
looking
at
they
have
made
one
or
two
artificial
ports
and
they
are
no
great
things
there
is
no
getting
out
or
getting
in
in
fact
they
have
no
harbours
in
the
channel
while
we
have
the
finest
in
the
world
a
peculiar
dispensation
of
providence
because
it
knew
that
we
should
want
them
and
france
would
not
in
france
what
are
called
ports
are
all
alike
nasty
narrow
holes
only
to
be
entered
at
certain
times
of
tide
and
certain
winds
made
up
of
basins
and
and
cabarets
just
fit
for
smugglers
to
run
into
and
nothing
more
and
therefore
they
are
used
for
very
little
else
now
in
the
called
st
maloes
there
is
some
pretty
land
although
a
great
deficiency
of
marine
scenery
but
never
mind
that
stay
at
home
and
do
go
abroad
to
drink
sour
wine
because
they
call
it
bordeaux
and
eat
villanous
trash
so
disguised
by
cooking
that
you
can
not
possibly
tell
which
of
the
birds
of
the
air
or
beasts
of
the
field
or
fishes
of
the
sea
you
are
cramming
down
your
throat
if
all
is
right
there
is
no
occasion
for
disguise
is
an
old
saying
so
depend
upon
it
that
there
is
something
wrong
and
that
you
are
eating
offal
under
a
grand
french
name
they
eat
everything
in
france
and
would
serve
you
up
the
head
of
a
monkey
who
has
died
of
the
smallpox
as
au
petite
that
is
if
you
did
not
understand
french
if
you
did
they
would
call
it
a
and
then
you
would
be
even
more
puzzled
as
for
their
wine
there
is
no
disguise
in
that
it
half
vinegar
no
no
stay
at
home
you
can
live
just
as
cheaply
if
you
choose
and
then
you
will
have
good
meat
good
vegetables
good
ale
good
beer
and
a
good
glass
of
grog
and
what
is
of
more
importance
you
will
be
in
good
company
live
with
your
friends
and
do
make
a
fool
of
yourself
i
would
not
have
condescended
to
have
noticed
this
place
had
it
not
been
that
i
wish
you
to
observe
a
vessel
which
is
lying
along
the
with
a
plank
from
the
shore
to
her
gunnel
it
is
low
water
and
she
is
aground
and
the
plank
dips
down
at
such
an
angle
that
it
is
a
work
of
danger
to
go
either
in
or
out
of
her
you
observe
that
there
is
nothing
very
remarkable
in
her
she
is
a
cutter
and
a
good
and
sails
well
before
the
wind
she
is
short
for
her
breadth
of
beam
and
is
not
armed
smugglers
do
not
arm
now
the
service
is
too
dangerous
they
effect
their
purpose
by
cunning
not
by
force
nevertheless
it
requires
that
smugglers
should
be
good
seamen
smart
active
fellows
and
or
they
can
do
nothing
this
vessel
has
not
a
large
cargo
in
her
but
it
is
valuable
she
has
some
thousand
yards
of
lace
a
few
hundred
pounds
of
tea
a
few
bales
of
silk
and
about
forty
ankers
of
brandy
just
as
much
as
they
can
land
in
one
boat
all
they
ask
is
a
heavy
gale
or
a
thick
fog
and
they
trust
to
themselves
for
success
there
is
nobody
on
board
except
a
boy
the
crew
are
all
up
at
the
cabaret
settling
their
little
accounts
of
every
description
for
they
smuggle
both
ways
and
every
man
has
his
own
private
venture
there
they
are
all
fifteen
of
them
and
fellows
too
sitting
at
that
long
table
they
are
very
merry
but
quite
sober
as
they
are
to
sail
the
captain
of
the
vessel
whose
name
is
the
the
captain
christened
her
himself
is
that
young
man
with
dark
whiskers
meeting
under
his
throat
his
name
is
jack
pickersgill
you
perceive
at
once
that
he
is
much
above
a
common
sailor
in
appearance
his
manners
are
good
he
is
remarkably
handsome
very
clean
and
rather
a
dandy
in
his
dress
observe
how
very
politely
he
takes
off
his
hat
to
that
frenchman
with
whom
he
has
just
settled
accounts
he
beats
johnny
crapeau
at
his
own
weapons
and
then
there
is
an
air
of
command
a
feeling
of
conscious
superiority
about
jack
see
how
he
treats
the
landlord
haut
en
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
very
civil
the
fact
is
that
jack
is
of
a
very
good
old
family
and
received
a
very
excellent
education
but
he
was
an
orphan
his
friends
were
poor
and
could
do
but
little
for
him
he
went
out
to
india
as
a
cadet
ran
away
and
served
in
a
schooner
which
smuggled
opium
into
china
and
then
came
home
he
took
a
liking
to
the
employment
and
is
now
laying
up
a
very
pretty
little
sum
not
that
he
intends
to
stop
no
as
soon
as
he
has
enough
to
fit
out
a
vessel
for
himself
he
intends
to
start
again
for
india
and
with
two
cargoes
of
opium
he
will
return
he
trusts
with
a
handsome
fortune
and
his
family
name
such
are
jack
intentions
and
as
he
eventually
means
to
reappear
as
a
gentleman
he
preserves
his
gentlemanly
habits
he
neither
drinks
nor
chews
nor
smokes
he
keeps
his
hands
clean
wears
rings
and
sports
a
gold
notwithstanding
which
jack
is
one
of
the
boldest
and
best
of
sailors
and
the
men
know
it
he
is
full
of
fun
and
as
keen
as
a
razor
jack
has
a
very
heavy
venture
this
time
all
the
lace
is
his
own
speculation
and
if
he
gets
it
in
safe
he
will
clear
some
thousands
of
pounds
a
certain
fashionable
shop
in
london
has
already
agreed
to
take
the
whole
off
his
hands
that
short
young
man
is
the
second
in
command
and
the
companion
of
the
captain
he
is
clever
and
always
has
a
remedy
to
propose
when
there
is
a
difficulty
which
is
a
great
quality
in
a
second
in
command
his
name
is
corbett
he
is
always
merry
knows
the
markets
runs
up
to
london
and
does
business
as
well
as
a
chapman
lives
for
the
day
and
laughs
at
that
little
punchy
old
man
with
long
gray
hair
and
fat
face
with
a
nose
like
a
note
of
interrogation
is
the
next
personage
of
importance
he
ought
to
be
called
the
for
although
he
goes
on
shore
in
france
off
the
english
coast
he
never
quits
the
vessel
when
they
leave
her
with
the
goods
he
remains
on
board
he
is
always
to
be
found
off
any
part
of
the
coast
where
he
may
be
ordered
holding
his
position
in
defiance
of
gales
and
tides
and
fogs
as
for
the
they
all
know
him
well
enough
but
they
can
not
touch
a
vessel
in
ballast
if
she
has
no
more
men
on
board
than
allowed
by
her
tonnage
he
knows
every
creek
and
hole
and
corner
of
the
coast
how
the
tide
runs
in
tide
eddy
or
current
that
is
his
value
his
name
is
morrison
you
observe
that
jack
pickersgill
has
two
excellent
supporters
in
corbett
and
morrison
his
other
men
are
good
seamen
active
and
obedient
which
is
all
that
he
requires
i
shall
not
particularly
introduce
them
now
you
may
call
for
another
my
lads
and
that
must
be
the
last
the
tide
is
flowing
fast
and
we
shall
be
afloat
in
half
an
hour
and
we
have
just
the
breeze
we
want
what
d
think
morrison
shall
we
have
dirt
i
been
looking
just
now
and
if
it
were
any
other
month
in
the
year
i
should
say
yes
but
there
no
trusting
april
captain
howsomever
if
it
does
blow
off
i
promise
you
a
fog
in
three
hours
afterwards
that
will
do
as
well
corbett
have
you
settled
with
duval
yes
after
more
noise
and
than
a
panic
in
the
stock
exchange
would
make
in
england
he
fought
and
squabbled
for
an
hour
and
i
found
that
without
some
abatement
i
never
should
have
settled
the
affair
what
did
you
let
him
off
seventeen
sous
replied
corbett
laughing
and
that
satisfied
him
inquired
pickersgill
yes
it
was
all
he
could
prove
to
be
a
two
of
the
knives
were
a
little
rusty
but
he
will
always
have
something
off
he
could
not
be
happy
without
it
i
really
think
he
would
commit
suicide
if
he
had
to
pay
a
bill
without
a
deduction

him
live
replied
pickersgill
jeannette
a
bottle
of
volnay
of
and
three
glasses
jeannette
who
was
the
de
soon
appeared
with
a
bottle
of
wine
seldom
called
for
except
by
the
captain
of
the
you
sail
said
she
as
she
placed
the
bottle
before
him
pickersgill
nodded
his
head
i
had
a
strange
dream
said
jeannette
i
thought
you
were
all
taken
by
a
revenue
cutter
and
put
in
a
i
went
to
see
you
and
i
did
not
know
one
of
you
again
you
were
all
changed
very
likely
jeannette
you
would
not
be
the
first
who
did
not
know
their
friends
again
when
in
misfortune
there
was
nothing
strange
in
your
dream
mon
dieu
je
ne
suis
pas
comme
ça
no
that
you
are
not
jeannette
you
are
a
good
girl
and
some
of
these
fine
days
i
marry
you
said
corbett
être
bien
beau
ce
jour
là
par
replied
jeannette
laughing
you
have
promised
to
marry
me
every
time
you
have
come
in
these
last
three
years
well
that
proves
i
keep
to
my
promise
any
how
yes
but
you
never
go
any
further
i
ca
spare
him
jeannette
that
is
the
real
truth
said
the
captain
but
wait
a
little
in
the
meantime
here
is
a
piece
to
add
to
your
bien
monsieur
le
capitaine
bon
voyage
jeannette
held
her
finger
up
to
corbett
saying
with
a
smile
and
then
quitted
the
room
come
morrison
help
us
to
empty
this
bottle
and
then
we
will
all
go
on
board
i
wish
that
girl
would
come
here
with
her
nonsensical
dreams
said
morrison
taking
his
seat
i
do
like
it
when
she
said
that
we
should
be
taken
by
a
revenue
cutter
i
was
looking
at
a
blue
and
a
white
pigeon
sitting
on
the
wall
opposite
and
i
said
to
myself
now
if
that
be
a
warning
i
will
see
if
the
pigeon
flies
away
first
i
shall
be
in
jail
in
a
week
if
the
i
shall
be
back
here
well
said
pickersgill
laughing
it
was
well
answered
morrison
tossing
off
his
wine
and
putting
the
glass
down
with
a
deep
sigh
for
the
cursed
pigeon
flew
away
immediately
why
morrison
you
must
have
a
to
be
frightened
at
a
blue
pigeon
said
corbett
laughing
and
looking
out
of
the
window
at
all
events
he
has
come
back
again
and
there
he
is
sitting
by
the
white
one
it
the
first
time
that
ever
i
was
called
replied
morrison
in
wrath
nor
do
you
deserve
it
morrison
replied
pickersgill
but
corbett
is
only
joking
well
at
all
events
i
try
my
luck
in
the
same
way
and
see
whether
i
am
to
be
in
jail
i
shall
take
the
blue
pigeon
as
my
bad
omen
as
you
did
the
sailors
and
captain
pickersgill
all
rose
and
went
to
the
window
to
ascertain
corbett
fortune
by
this
new
species
of
augury
the
blue
pigeon
flapped
his
wings
and
then
he
sidled
up
to
the
white
one
at
last
the
white
pigeon
flew
off
the
wall
and
settled
on
the
roof
of
the
adjacent
house
bravo
white
pigeon
said
corbett
i
shall
be
here
again
in
a
week
the
whole
party
laughing
then
resumed
their
seats
and
morrison
countenance
brightened
up
as
he
took
the
glass
of
wine
poured
out
by
pickersgill
he
said
here
your
health
corbett
it
was
all
nonsense
after
all
for
d
see
i
ca
be
put
in
jail
without
you
are
we
all
sail
in
the
same
boat
and
when
you
leave
me
you
take
with
you
everything
that
can
condemn
the
vessel
so
here
success
to
our
trip
we
will
all
drink
that
toast
my
lads
and
then
on
board
said
the
captain
here
success
to
our
trip
the
captain
rose
as
did
the
mates
and
men
drank
the
toast
turned
down
the
on
the
table
hastened
to
the
wharf
and
in
half
an
hour
the
was
clear
of
the
port
of
st
maloes
chapter
iv
portland
bill
the
sailed
with
a
fresh
breeze
and
a
flowing
sheet
from
st
maloes
the
evening
before
the
sailed
from
barn
pool
the
sailed
from
portsmouth
the
morning
after
the
yacht
as
we
before
observed
was
bound
to
cowes
in
the
isle
of
wight
the
had
orders
to
cruise
wherever
she
pleased
within
the
limits
of
the
admiral
station
and
she
ran
for
west
bay
on
the
other
side
of
the
bill
of
portland
the
was
also
bound
for
that
bay
to
land
her
cargo
the
wind
was
light
and
there
was
every
appearance
of
fine
weather
when
the
at
ten
on
the
tuesday
night
made
the
portland
lights
as
it
was
impossible
to
run
her
cargo
that
night
she
hove
to
at
eleven
the
portland
lights
were
made
by
the
revenue
cutter
mr
appleboy
went
up
to
have
a
look
at
them
ordered
the
cutter
to
be
hove
to
and
then
went
down
to
finish
his
allowance
of
at
twelve
the
yacht
made
the
portland
lights
and
continued
her
course
hardly
stemming
the
ebb
tide
day
broke
and
the
horizon
was
clear
the
first
on
the
were
of
course
the
smugglers
they
and
those
on
board
the
revenue
cutter
were
the
only
two
interested
parties
the
yacht
was
neuter
there
are
two
cutters
in
sight
sir
said
corbett
who
had
the
watch
for
pickersgill
having
been
up
the
whole
night
had
thrown
himself
down
on
the
bed
with
his
clothes
on
what
do
they
look
like
said
pickersgill
who
was
up
in
a
moment
one
is
a
yacht
and
the
other
may
be
but
i
rather
think
as
far
as
i
can
judge
in
the
gray
that
it
is
our
old
friend
off
here
what
old
appleboy
yes
it
looks
like
him
but
the
day
has
scarcely
broke
yet
well
he
can
do
nothing
in
a
light
wind
like
this
and
before
the
wind
we
can
show
him
our
heels
but
are
you
sure
the
other
is
a
yacht
said
pickersgill
coming
on
deck
yes
the
king
is
more
careful
of
his
canvas
you
right
said
pickersgill
that
is
a
yacht
and
you
right
there
again
in
your
guess
that
is
the
stupid
old
which
creeps
about
creeping
for
tubs
well
i
see
nothing
to
alarm
us
at
present
provided
it
do
fall
a
dead
calm
and
then
we
must
take
to
our
boat
as
soon
as
he
takes
to
his
we
are
four
miles
from
him
at
least
watch
his
motions
corbett
and
see
if
he
lowers
a
boat
what
does
she
go
now
four
knots
that
will
soon
tire
their
men
the
positions
of
the
three
cutters
were
as
follows
the
was
about
four
miles
off
portland
head
and
well
into
west
bay
the
revenue
cutter
was
close
to
the
head
the
yacht
was
outside
of
the
smuggler
about
two
miles
to
the
westward
and
about
five
or
six
miles
from
the
revenue
cutter
two
vessels
in
sight
sir
said
mr
smith
coming
down
into
the
cabin
to
mr
appleboy
very
well
replied
the
lieutenant
who
was
down
in
his
the
people
say
one
is
the
sir
drawled
smith
heh
what
yes
i
recollect
i
boarded
her
twenty
times
always
empty
how
she
standing
she
stands
to
the
westward
now
sir
but
she
was
hove
to
they
say
when
they
first
saw
her
then
she
has
a
cargo
in
her
and
mr
appleboy
shaved
himself
dressed
and
went
on
deck
yes
said
the
lieutenant
rubbing
his
eyes
again
and
again
and
then
looking
through
the
glass
it
is
her
sure
enough
let
draw
the
fore
sheet
hands
make
sail
what
vessel
the
other
do
know
sir
she
a
cutter
a
cutter
yes
may
be
a
yacht
or
may
be
the
new
cutter
ordered
on
the
station
make
all
sail
mr
tomkins
hoist
our
pendant
and
fire
a
gun
they
will
understand
what
we
mean
then
they
do
know
the
as
well
as
we
do
in
a
few
minutes
the
was
under
a
press
of
sail
she
hoisted
her
pendant
and
fired
a
gun
the
smuggler
perceived
that
the
had
recognised
her
and
she
also
threw
out
more
canvas
and
ran
off
more
to
the
westward
there
a
gun
sir
reported
one
of
the
men
to
mr
stewart
on
board
of
the
yacht
yes
give
me
the
glass
a
revenue
cutter
then
this
vessel
in
shore
running
towards
us
must
be
a
smuggler
she
has
just
now
made
all
sail
sir
yes
there
no
doubt
of
it
i
will
go
down
to
his
lordship
keep
her
as
she
goes
mr
stewart
then
went
down
to
inform
lord
of
the
circumstance
not
only
lord
but
most
of
the
gentlemen
came
on
deck
as
did
soon
afterwards
the
ladies
who
had
received
the
intelligence
from
lord
who
spoke
to
them
through
the
door
of
the
cabin
but
the
smuggler
had
more
wind
than
the
revenue
cutter
and
increased
her
distance
if
we
were
to
wear
round
now
my
lord
observed
mr
stewart
she
is
just
abreast
of
us
and
in
shore
we
could
prevent
her
escape
round
with
her
mr
stewart
said
lord
we
must
do
our
duty
and
protect
the
laws
that
will
not
be
fair
papa
said
cecilia
ossulton
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
smugglers
i
sure
the
ladies
have
not
for
they
bring
us
beautiful
things
miss
ossulton
observed
her
aunt
it
is
not
proper
for
you
to
offer
an
opinion
the
yacht
wore
round
and
sailing
so
fast
the
smuggler
had
little
chance
of
escaping
her
but
to
chase
is
one
thing
to
capture
another
let
us
give
her
a
gun
said
lord
that
will
frighten
her
and
he
dare
not
cross
our
hawse
the
gun
was
loaded
and
not
being
more
than
a
mile
from
the
smuggler
actually
threw
the
ball
almost
a
quarter
of
the
way
the
gentlemen
as
well
as
lord
were
equally
excited
by
the
ardour
of
pursuit
but
the
wind
died
away
and
at
last
it
was
nearly
calm
the
revenue
cutter
boats
were
out
and
coming
up
fast
let
us
get
our
boat
out
stewart
said
his
lordship
and
help
them
it
is
quite
calm
now
the
boat
was
soon
out
it
was
a
very
large
one
usually
stowed
on
and
occupied
a
large
portion
of
the
deck
it
pulled
six
oars
and
when
it
was
manned
mr
stewart
jumped
in
and
lord
followed
him
but
you
have
no
arms
said
mr
hautaine
the
smugglers
never
resist
now
observed
stewart
then
you
are
going
on
a
very
gallant
expedition
indeed
observed
cecilia
ossulton
i
wish
you
joy
but
lord
was
too
much
excited
to
pay
attention
they
shoved
off
and
pulled
towards
the
smuggler
at
this
time
the
revenue
boats
were
about
five
miles
astern
of
the
and
the
yacht
about
of
a
mile
from
her
in
the
offing
pickersgill
had
of
course
observed
the
motions
of
the
yacht
had
seen
her
wear
on
chase
hoist
her
ensign
and
pendant
and
fire
her
gun
well
said
he
this
is
the
blackest
ingratitude
to
be
attacked
by
the
very
people
whom
we
smuggle
for
i
only
wish
she
may
come
up
with
us
and
let
her
attempt
to
interfere
she
shall
rue
the
day
i
much
like
this
though
as
we
before
observed
it
fell
nearly
calm
and
the
revenue
boats
were
in
chase
pickersgill
watched
them
as
they
came
up
what
shall
we
do
said
corbett
get
the
boat
out
yes
replied
pickersgill
we
will
get
the
boat
out
and
have
the
goods
in
her
all
ready
but
we
can
pull
faster
than
they
do
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
next
they
will
be
pretty
well
tired
before
they
come
up
to
us
we
are
fresh
and
shall
soon
walk
away
from
them
so
i
shall
not
leave
the
vessel
till
they
are
within
half
a
mile
we
must
sink
the
ankers
that
they
may
not
seize
the
vessel
for
it
is
not
worth
while
taking
them
with
us
pass
them
along
ready
to
run
them
over
the
bows
that
they
may
not
see
us
and
swear
to
it
but
we
have
a
good
half
hour
and
more
ay
and
you
may
hold
all
fast
if
you
choose
said
morrison
although
it
better
to
be
on
the
right
side
and
get
ready
otherwise
before
half
an
hour
i
swear
that
we
are
out
of
their
sight
look
there
said
he
pointing
to
the
eastward
at
a
heavy
bank
it
coming
right
down
upon
us
as
i
said
it
would
true
enough
but
still
there
is
no
saying
which
will
come
first
morrison
the
boats
or
the
fog
so
we
must
be
prepared
hilloa
what
this
why
there
a
boat
coming
from
the
yacht
pickersgill
took
out
his
glass
yes
and
the
yacht
own
boat
with
the
name
painted
on
her
bows
well
let
them
come
we
will
have
no
ceremony
in
resisting
them
they
are
not
in
the
act
of
parliament
and
must
take
the
consequences
we
have
nought
to
fear
get
stretchers
my
lads
and
they
row
six
oars
and
are
three
in
the
stern
sheets
they
must
be
good
men
if
they
take
us
in
a
few
minutes
lord
was
close
to
the
smuggler
boat
ahoy
what
do
you
want
surrender
in
the
king
name
to
what
and
to
whom
and
what
are
we
to
surrender
we
are
an
english
vessel
coasting
along
shore
pull
on
board
my
lads
cried
stewart
i
am
a
king
officer
we
know
her
the
boat
darted
alongside
and
stewart
and
lord
followed
by
the
men
jumped
on
the
deck
well
gentlemen
what
do
you
want
said
pickersgill
we
seize
you
you
are
a
smuggler
there
no
denying
it
look
at
the
casks
of
spirits
stretched
along
the
deck
we
never
said
that
we
were
not
smugglers
replied
pickersgill
but
what
is
that
to
you
you
are
not
a
king
ship
or
employed
by
the
revenue
no
but
we
carry
a
pendant
and
it
is
our
duty
to
protect
the
laws
and
who
are
you
said
pickersgill
i
am
lord
b
then
my
lord
allow
me
to
say
that
you
would
do
much
better
to
attend
to
the
framing
of
laws
and
leave
people
of
less
consequence
like
those
astern
of
me
to
execute
them
your
own
business
is
an
old
adage
we
shall
not
hurt
you
my
lord
as
you
have
only
employed
words
but
we
shall
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
hurt
us
come
aft
my
lads
now
my
lord
resistance
is
useless
we
are
double
your
numbers
and
you
have
caught
a
tartar
lord
and
mr
stewart
perceived
that
they
were
in
an
awkward
predicament
you
may
do
what
you
please
observed
mr
stewart
but
the
revenue
boats
are
coming
up
recollect
look
you
sir
do
you
see
the
revenue
cutter
said
pickersgill
stewart
looked
in
that
direction
and
saw
that
she
was
hidden
in
the
fog
in
five
minutes
sir
the
boats
will
be
out
of
sight
also
and
so
will
your
vessel
we
have
nothing
to
fear
from
them
indeed
my
lord
we
had
better
return
said
mr
stewart
who
perceived
that
pickersgill
was
right
i
beg
your
pardon
you
will
not
go
on
board
your
yacht
so
soon
as
you
expect
take
the
oars
out
of
the
boat
my
lads
two
or
three
of
you
and
throw
in
a
couple
of
our
paddles
for
them
to
reach
the
shore
with
the
rest
of
you
knock
down
the
first
man
who
offers
to
resist
you
are
not
aware
perhaps
my
lord
that
you
have
attempted
on
the
high
seas
stewart
looked
at
lord
b
it
was
true
enough
the
men
of
the
yacht
could
offer
no
resistance
the
oars
were
taken
out
of
the
boat
and
the
men
put
in
again
my
lord
said
pickersgill
your
boat
is
manned
do
me
the
favour
to
step
into
it
and
you
sir
do
the
same
i
should
be
sorry
to
lay
my
hands
upon
a
peer
of
the
realm
or
a
king
officer
even
on
half
pay
remonstrance
was
vain
his
lordship
was
led
to
the
boat
by
two
of
the
smugglers
and
stewart
followed
i
will
leave
your
oars
my
lord
at
the
weymouth
and
i
trust
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
in
future
to
your
own
business
the
boat
was
shoved
off
from
the
sloop
by
the
smugglers
and
was
soon
lost
sight
of
in
the
fog
which
had
now
covered
the
revenue
boats
as
well
as
the
yacht
at
the
same
time
it
brought
down
a
breeze
from
the
eastward
haul
to
the
wind
morrison
said
pickersgill
we
will
stand
out
to
get
rid
of
the
boats
if
they
pull
on
they
will
take
it
for
granted
that
we
shall
run
into
the
bay
as
will
the
revenue
cutter
pickersgill
and
corbett
were
in
conversation
abaft
for
a
short
time
when
the
former
desired
the
course
to
be
altered
two
points
keep
silence
all
of
you
my
lads
and
let
me
know
if
you
hear
a
gun
or
a
bell
from
the
yacht
said
pickersgill
there
is
a
gun
sir
close
to
us
said
one
of
the
men
the
sound
was
right
ahead
that
will
do
keep
her
as
she
goes
aft
here
my
lads
we
can
not
run
our
cargo
in
the
bay
for
the
cutter
has
been
seen
to
chase
us
and
they
will
all
be
on
the
at
the
preventive
stations
for
us
on
shore
now
my
lads
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
as
these
yacht
gentlemen
have
thought
proper
to
interfere
i
will
take
possession
of
the
yacht
for
a
few
days
we
shall
then
everything
go
where
we
like
unsuspected
and
land
our
cargo
with
ease
i
shall
run
alongside
of
her
she
can
have
but
few
hands
on
board
and
mind
do
not
hurt
anybody
but
be
civil
and
obey
my
orders
morrison
you
and
your
four
men
and
the
boy
will
remain
on
board
as
before
and
take
the
vessel
to
cherbourg
where
we
will
join
you
in
a
short
time
another
gun
was
fired
from
the
yacht
those
on
board
particularly
the
ladies
were
alarmed
the
fog
was
very
thick
and
they
could
not
distinguish
the
length
of
the
vessel
they
had
seen
the
boat
board
but
had
not
seen
her
turned
adrift
without
oars
as
the
fog
came
on
just
at
that
time
the
yacht
was
left
with
only
three
seamen
on
board
and
should
it
come
on
bad
weather
they
were
in
an
awkward
predicament
mr
hautaine
had
taken
the
command
and
ordered
the
guns
to
be
fired
that
the
boat
might
be
enabled
to
find
them
the
fourth
gun
was
loading
when
they
perceived
the
smuggler
cutter
close
to
them
looming
through
the
fog
here
they
are
cried
the
seamen
and
they
have
brought
the
prize
along
with
them
three
cheers
for
the
hilloa
you
be
on
board
of
us
cried
hautaine
that
exactly
what
i
intended
to
be
sir
replied
pickersgill
jumping
on
the
followed
by
his
men
who
the
devil
are
you
that
exactly
the
same
question
that
i
asked
lord
when
he
boarded
us
replied
pickersgill
taking
off
his
hat
to
the
ladies
well
but
what
business
have
you
here
exactly
the
same
question
which
i
put
to
lord
replied
pickersgill
where
is
lord
sir
said
cecilia
ossulton
going
up
to
the
smuggler
is
he
safe
yes
madam
he
is
safe
at
least
he
is
in
his
boat
with
all
his
men
and
unhurt
but
you
must
excuse
me
if
i
request
you
and
the
other
ladies
to
go
down
below
while
i
speak
to
these
gentlemen
be
under
no
alarm
miss
you
will
receive
neither
insult
nor
i
have
only
taken
possession
of
this
vessel
for
the
present
take
possession
cried
hautaine
of
a
yacht
yes
sir
since
the
owner
of
the
yacht
thought
proper
to
attempt
to
take
possession
of
me
i
always
thought
that
yachts
were
sailing
about
for
amusement
respected
themselves
and
not
interfering
with
others
but
it
appears
that
such
is
not
the
case
the
owner
of
this
yacht
has
thought
proper
to
break
through
the
neutrality
and
commence
aggression
and
under
such
circumstances
i
have
now
in
retaliation
taken
possession
of
her
and
pray
what
do
you
mean
to
do
sir
simply
for
a
few
days
to
make
an
exchange
i
shall
send
you
on
board
of
my
vessel
as
smugglers
while
i
remain
here
with
the
ladies
and
amuse
myself
with
yachting
why
sir
you
can
not
mean
i
have
said
gentlemen
and
that
is
enough
i
should
be
sorry
to
resort
to
violence
but
i
must
be
obeyed
you
have
i
perceive
three
seamen
only
left
they
are
not
sufficient
to
take
charge
of
the
vessel
and
lord
and
the
others
you
will
not
meet
for
several
days
my
regard
for
the
ladies
even
common
humanity
points
out
to
me
that
i
can
not
leave
the
vessel
in
this
crippled
condition
at
the
same
time
as
i
must
have
hands
on
board
of
my
own
you
will
oblige
me
by
going
on
board
and
taking
her
safely
into
port
it
is
the
least
return
you
can
make
for
my
kindness
in
those
dresses
gentlemen
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
your
duty
oblige
me
by
shifting
and
putting
on
these
corbett
handed
a
flannel
shirt
a
rough
jacket
and
trousers
to
messrs
hautaine
ossulton
vaughan
and
seagrove
after
some
useless
resistance
they
were
stripped
and
having
put
on
the
smugglers
attire
they
were
handed
on
board
of
the
the
three
english
seamen
were
also
sent
on
board
and
confined
below
as
well
as
ossulton
servant
who
was
also
equipped
like
his
master
and
confined
below
with
the
seamen
corbett
and
the
men
then
handed
up
all
the
smuggled
goods
into
the
yacht
dropped
the
boat
and
made
it
fast
astern
and
morrison
having
received
his
directions
the
vessels
separated
morrison
running
for
cherbourg
and
pickersgill
steering
the
yacht
along
shore
to
the
westward
about
an
hour
after
this
exchange
had
been
effected
the
fog
cleared
up
and
showed
the
revenue
cutter
hove
to
for
her
boats
which
had
pulled
back
and
were
close
on
board
of
her
and
the
about
three
miles
in
the
offing
lord
and
his
boat
crew
were
about
four
miles
in
shore
paddling
and
drifting
with
the
tide
towards
portland
as
soon
as
the
boats
were
on
board
the
revenue
cutter
made
all
sail
after
the
smuggler
paying
no
attention
to
the
yacht
and
either
not
seeing
or
not
caring
about
the
boat
which
was
drifting
about
in
west
bay
chapter
v
the
travestie
here
we
are
corbett
and
now
i
only
wish
my
venture
had
been
double
observed
pickersgill
but
i
shall
not
allow
business
to
absorb
me
wholly
we
must
add
a
little
amusement
it
appears
to
me
corbett
that
the
gentleman
clothes
which
lie
there
will
fit
you
and
those
of
the
fellow
who
was
spokesman
will
i
am
sure
suit
me
well
now
let
us
dress
ourselves
and
then
for
breakfast
pickersgill
then
exchanged
his
clothes
for
those
of
mr
hautaine
and
corbett
fitted
on
those
of
mr
ossulton
the
steward
was
summoned
up
and
he
dared
not
disobey
he
appeared
on
deck
trembling
steward
you
will
take
these
clothes
below
said
pickersgill
and
observe
i
now
command
this
yacht
and
during
the
time
that
i
am
on
board
you
will
pay
me
the
same
respect
as
you
did
lord
nay
more
you
will
always
address
me
as
lord
b
you
will
prepare
dinner
and
breakfast
and
do
your
duty
just
as
if
his
lordship
was
on
board
and
take
care
that
you
feed
us
well
for
i
will
not
allow
the
ladies
to
be
entertained
in
a
less
sumptuous
manner
than
you
will
tell
the
cook
what
i
say
and
now
that
you
have
heard
me
take
care
that
you
obey
if
not
recollect
that
i
have
my
own
men
here
and
if
i
but
point
with
my
finger
you
do
you
perfectly
comprehend
me
yes
sir
stammered
the
steward
yes
what
did
i
tell
you
sirrah
yes
my
do
you
understand
me
yes
my
lord
pray
steward
whose
clothes
has
this
gentleman
put
on
mr
mr
ossulton
i
think
sir
my
lord
i
mean
very
well
steward
then
recollect
in
future
you
always
address
that
gentleman
as
yes
my
lord
and
the
steward
went
down
below
and
was
obliged
to
take
a
couple
of
glasses
of
brandy
to
keep
himself
from
fainting
who
are
they
and
what
are
they
mr
maddox
cried
the
who
had
been
weeping
pirates
murderous
pirates
replied
the
steward
oh
screamed
the
what
will
become
of
us
poor
unprotected
females
and
she
hastened
into
the
cabin
to
impart
this
dreadful
intelligence
the
ladies
in
the
cabin
were
not
in
a
very
enviable
situation
as
for
the
elder
miss
ossulton
but
perhaps
it
will
be
better
in
future
to
distinguish
the
two
ladies
by
calling
the
elder
simply
miss
ossulton
and
her
niece
cecilia
she
was
sitting
with
her
salts
to
her
nose
agonised
with
a
mixture
of
trepidation
and
wounded
pride
mrs
lascelles
was
weeping
but
weeping
gently
cecilia
was
sad
and
her
heart
was
beating
with
anxiety
and
suspense
when
the
maid
rushed
in
o
madam
o
miss
o
mrs
lascelles
i
have
found
it
all
out
they
are
murderous
bloody
pirates
mercy
on
us
exclaimed
miss
ossulton
surely
they
will
never
dare
oh
they
dare
anything
they
just
now
were
throwing
the
steward
overboard
and
they
have
rummaged
all
the
portmanteaus
and
dressed
themselves
in
the
gentlemen
best
clothes
the
captain
of
them
told
the
steward
that
he
was
lord
and
that
if
he
dared
to
call
him
anything
else
he
would
cut
his
throat
from
ear
to
ear
and
if
the
cook
give
them
a
good
dinner
they
swear
that
they
chop
his
right
hand
off
and
make
him
eat
it
without
pepper
or
salt
miss
ossulton
screamed
and
went
off
into
hysterics
mrs
lascelles
and
cecilia
went
to
her
assistance
but
the
latter
had
not
forgotten
the
very
different
behaviour
of
jack
pickersgill
and
his
polite
manners
when
he
boarded
the
vessel
she
did
not
therefore
believe
what
the
maid
had
reported
but
still
her
anxiety
and
suspense
were
great
especially
about
her
father
after
having
restored
her
aunt
she
put
on
her
bonnet
which
was
lying
on
the
sofa
where
are
you
going
dear
said
mrs
lascelles
on
deck
replied
cecilia
i
must
and
will
speak
to
these
men
gracious
heaven
miss
ossulton
going
on
deck
have
you
heard
what
phoebe
says
yes
aunt
i
have
but
i
can
wait
here
no
longer
stop
her
stop
her
she
will
be
murdered
she
will
be
she
is
mad
screamed
miss
ossulton
but
no
one
attempted
to
stop
cecilia
and
on
deck
she
went
on
her
arrival
she
found
jack
pickersgill
and
corbett
walking
the
deck
one
of
the
smugglers
at
the
helm
and
the
rest
forward
and
as
quiet
as
the
crew
of
the
yacht
as
soon
as
she
made
her
appearance
jack
took
off
his
hat
and
made
her
a
bow
i
do
not
know
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
addressing
young
lady
but
i
am
flattered
with
this
mark
of
confidence
you
feel
and
i
assure
you
you
feel
correctly
that
you
are
not
exactly
in
lawless
hands
cecilia
looked
with
more
surprise
than
fear
at
pickersgill
mr
hautaine
dress
became
him
he
was
a
handsome
man
and
had
nothing
of
the
ruffian
in
his
appearance
unless
like
corsair
he
was
savage
half
she
could
not
help
thinking
that
she
had
met
many
with
less
pretensions
as
far
as
appearance
went
to
the
claims
of
a
gentleman
at
almack
and
other
fashionable
circles
i
have
ventured
on
deck
sir
said
cecilia
with
a
little
tremulousness
in
her
voice
to
request
as
a
favour
that
you
will
inform
me
what
your
intentions
may
be
with
regard
to
the
vessel
and
with
regard
to
the
ladies
and
i
feel
much
obliged
to
you
for
so
doing
and
i
assure
you
i
will
as
far
as
i
have
made
up
my
own
mind
answer
you
candidly
but
you
tremble
allow
me
to
conduct
you
to
a
seat
in
few
words
then
to
remove
your
present
alarm
i
intend
that
the
vessel
shall
be
returned
to
its
owner
with
every
article
in
it
as
religiously
respected
as
if
they
were
church
property
with
respect
to
you
and
the
other
ladies
on
board
i
pledge
you
my
honour
that
you
have
nothing
to
fear
that
you
shall
be
treated
with
every
respect
your
privacy
never
invaded
and
that
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
restored
to
your
friends
young
lady
i
pledge
my
hopes
of
future
salvation
to
the
truth
of
this
but
at
the
same
time
i
must
make
a
few
conditions
which
however
will
not
be
very
severe
but
sir
replied
cecilia
much
relieved
for
pickersgill
had
stood
by
her
in
the
most
respectful
manner
you
are
i
presume
the
captain
of
the
smuggler
pray
answer
me
one
question
more
what
became
of
the
boat
with
lord
he
is
my
father
i
left
him
in
his
boat
without
a
hair
of
his
head
touched
young
lady
but
i
took
away
the
oars
then
he
will
perish
cried
cecilia
putting
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
no
young
lady
he
is
on
shore
probably
by
this
time
although
i
took
away
his
means
of
assisting
to
capture
us
i
left
him
the
means
of
gaining
the
land
it
is
not
every
one
who
would
have
done
that
after
his
conduct
to
us
i
begged
him
not
to
go
said
cecilia
i
told
him
that
it
was
not
fair
and
that
he
had
no
quarrel
with
the
smugglers
i
thank
you
even
for
that
replied
pickersgill
and
now
miss
i
have
not
the
pleasure
of
recollecting
his
lordship
family
name
ossulton
sir
said
cecilia
looking
at
pickersgill
with
surprise
then
with
your
permission
miss
ossulton
i
will
now
make
you
my
confidant
excuse
my
using
so
free
a
term
but
it
is
because
i
wish
to
relieve
your
fears
at
the
same
time
i
can
not
permit
you
to
divulge
all
my
intentions
to
the
whole
party
on
board
i
feel
that
i
may
trust
you
for
you
have
courage
and
where
there
is
courage
there
generally
is
truth
but
you
must
first
tell
me
whether
you
will
condescend
to
accept
these
terms
cecilia
demurred
a
moment
the
idea
of
being
the
confidant
of
a
smuggler
rather
startled
her
but
still
her
knowledge
of
what
his
intentions
were
if
she
might
not
reveal
them
might
be
important
as
perhaps
she
might
dissuade
him
she
could
be
in
no
worse
position
than
she
was
now
and
she
might
be
in
a
much
better
the
conduct
of
pickersgill
had
been
such
up
to
the
present
as
to
inspire
confidence
and
although
he
defied
the
laws
he
appeared
to
regard
the
courtesies
of
life
cecilia
was
a
courageous
girl
and
at
length
she
replied
provided
what
you
desire
me
to
keep
secret
will
not
be
injurious
to
any
one
or
compromise
me
in
my
peculiar
situation
i
consent
i
would
not
hurt
a
fly
miss
ossulton
but
in
and
i
have
too
much
respect
for
you
from
your
conduct
during
our
short
meeting
to
compromise
you
allow
me
now
to
be
very
candid
and
then
perhaps
you
will
acknowledge
that
in
my
situation
others
would
do
the
same
and
perhaps
not
show
half
so
much
forbearance
your
father
without
any
right
whatever
interferes
with
me
and
my
calling
he
attempts
to
make
me
a
prisoner
to
have
me
thrown
in
jail
heavily
fined
and
perhaps
sent
out
of
the
country
i
will
not
enter
into
any
defence
of
smuggling
it
is
sufficient
to
say
that
there
are
pains
and
penalties
attached
to
the
infraction
of
certain
laws
and
that
i
choose
to
risk
them
but
lord
was
not
empowered
by
government
to
attack
me
it
was
a
gratuitous
act
and
had
i
thrown
him
and
all
his
crew
into
the
sea
i
should
have
been
justified
for
it
was
in
short
an
act
of
piracy
on
their
part
now
as
your
father
has
thought
to
turn
a
yacht
into
a
revenue
cutter
you
can
not
be
surprised
at
my
retaliating
in
turning
her
into
a
smuggler
and
as
he
has
mixed
up
looking
after
the
revenue
with
yachting
he
can
not
be
surprised
if
i
retaliate
by
mixing
up
a
little
yachting
with
smuggling
i
have
dressed
your
male
companions
as
smugglers
and
have
sent
them
in
the
smuggling
vessel
to
cherbourg
where
they
will
be
safely
landed
and
i
have
dressed
myself
and
the
only
person
whom
i
could
join
with
me
in
this
frolic
as
gentlemen
in
their
places
my
object
is
twofold
one
is
to
land
my
cargo
which
i
have
now
on
board
and
which
is
very
valuable
the
other
is
to
retaliate
upon
your
father
and
his
companions
for
their
attempt
upon
me
by
stepping
into
their
shoes
and
enjoying
for
a
day
or
two
their
luxuries
it
is
my
intention
to
make
free
with
nothing
but
his
lordship
wine
and
eatables
that
you
may
be
assured
of
but
i
shall
have
no
pleasure
if
the
ladies
do
not
sit
down
to
the
with
us
as
they
did
before
with
your
father
and
his
friends
you
can
hardly
expect
that
sir
said
cecilia
yes
i
do
and
that
will
be
not
only
the
price
of
the
early
release
of
the
yacht
and
themselves
but
it
will
also
be
the
only
means
by
which
they
will
obtain
anything
to
eat
you
observe
miss
ossulton
the
sins
of
the
fathers
are
visited
on
the
children
i
have
now
told
you
what
i
mean
to
do
and
what
i
wish
i
leave
you
to
think
of
it
and
decide
whether
it
will
not
be
the
best
for
all
parties
to
consent
you
have
my
permission
to
tell
the
other
ladies
that
whatever
may
be
their
conduct
they
are
as
secure
from
or
rudeness
as
if
they
were
in
grosvenor
square
but
i
can
not
answer
that
they
will
not
be
hungry
if
after
such
forbearance
in
every
point
they
show
so
little
gratitude
as
not
to
honour
me
with
their
company
then
i
am
to
understand
that
we
are
to
be
starved
into
submission
no
not
starved
miss
ossulton
but
recollect
that
you
will
be
on
bread
and
water
and
detained
until
you
do
consent
and
your
detention
will
increase
the
anxiety
of
your
father
you
know
how
to
persuade
sir
said
cecilia
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
trust
i
shall
ever
be
ready
to
sacrifice
any
feelings
of
pride
to
spare
my
father
so
much
uneasiness
with
your
permission
i
will
now
go
down
into
the
cabin
and
relieve
my
companions
from
the
worst
of
their
fears
as
for
obtaining
what
you
wish
i
can
only
say
that
as
a
young
person
i
am
not
likely
to
have
much
influence
with
those
older
than
myself
and
must
inevitably
be
overruled
as
i
have
not
permission
to
point
out
to
them
reasons
which
might
avail
would
you
so
far
allow
me
to
be
relieved
from
my
promise
as
to
communicate
all
you
have
said
to
me
to
the
only
married
woman
on
board
i
think
i
then
might
obtain
your
wishes
which
i
must
candidly
tell
you
i
shall
attempt
to
effect
because
i
am
most
anxious
to
rejoin
my
friends
and
be
relieved
of
my
company
replied
pickersgill
smiling
ironically
of
course
you
are
but
i
must
and
will
have
my
petty
revenge
and
although
you
may
and
probably
will
detest
me
at
all
events
you
shall
not
have
any
very
formidable
charge
to
make
against
me
before
you
go
below
miss
ossulton
i
give
you
my
permission
to
add
the
married
lady
to
the
number
of
my
confidants
and
you
must
permit
me
to
introduce
my
friend
mr
ossulton
and
pickersgill
waved
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
corbett
who
took
off
his
hat
and
made
a
low
obeisance
it
was
impossible
for
cecilia
ossulton
to
help
smiling
and
continued
pickersgill
having
taking
the
command
of
this
yacht
instead
of
his
lordship
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
i
also
take
his
lordship
name
while
on
board
i
am
lord
and
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
under
that
name
i
can
not
be
addressed
otherwise
depend
upon
it
miss
ossulton
that
i
shall
have
a
most
paternal
solicitude
to
make
you
happy
and
comfortable
had
cecilia
ossulton
dared
to
have
given
vent
to
her
real
feelings
at
that
time
she
would
have
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
it
was
too
ludicrous
at
the
same
time
the
very
burlesque
reassured
her
still
more
she
went
into
the
cabin
with
a
heavy
weight
removed
from
her
heart
in
the
meantime
miss
ossulton
and
mrs
lascelles
remained
below
in
the
greatest
anxiety
at
cecilia
prolonged
stay
they
knew
not
what
to
think
and
dared
not
go
on
deck
mrs
lascelles
had
once
determined
at
all
risks
to
go
up
but
miss
ossulton
and
phoebe
had
screamed
and
implored
her
so
fervently
not
to
leave
them
that
she
unwillingly
consented
to
remain
cecilia
countenance
when
she
entered
the
cabin
reassured
mrs
lascelles
but
not
her
aunt
who
ran
to
her
crying
and
sobbing
and
clinging
to
her
saying
what
have
they
done
to
you
my
poor
poor
cecilia
nothing
at
all
aunt
replied
cecilia
the
captain
speaks
very
fairly
and
says
he
shall
respect
us
in
every
possible
way
provided
that
we
obey
his
orders
but
if
not
if
not
what
cecilia
said
miss
ossulton
grasping
her
niece
arm
he
will
starve
us
and
not
let
us
go
god
have
mercy
on
us
cried
miss
ossulton
renewing
her
sobs
cecilia
then
went
to
mrs
lascelles
and
communicated
to
her
apart
all
that
had
passed
mrs
lascelles
agreed
with
cecilia
that
they
were
in
no
danger
of
insult
and
as
they
talked
over
the
matter
they
at
last
began
to
laugh
there
was
a
novelty
in
it
and
there
was
something
so
ridiculous
in
all
the
gentlemen
being
turned
into
smugglers
cecilia
was
glad
that
she
could
not
tell
her
aunt
as
she
wished
her
to
be
so
frightened
as
never
to
have
her
company
on
board
of
the
yacht
again
and
mrs
lascelles
was
too
glad
to
annoy
her
for
many
and
various
insults
received
the
matter
was
therefore
canvassed
over
very
satisfactorily
and
mrs
lascelles
felt
a
natural
curiosity
to
see
this
new
lord
and
the
second
mr
ossulton
but
they
had
had
no
breakfast
and
were
feeling
very
hungry
now
that
their
alarm
was
over
they
desired
phoebe
to
ask
the
steward
for
some
tea
or
coffee
the
reply
was
that
breakfast
was
laid
in
the
cabin
and
lord
trusted
that
the
ladies
would
come
to
partake
of
it
no
no
replied
mrs
lascelles
i
never
can
without
being
introduced
to
them
first
nor
will
i
go
replied
cecilia
but
i
will
write
a
note
and
we
will
have
our
breakfast
here
cecilia
wrote
a
note
in
pencil
as
follows
miss
ossulton
compliments
to
lord
and
as
the
ladies
feel
rather
indisposed
after
the
alarm
of
this
morning
they
trust
that
his
lordship
will
excuse
their
coming
to
breakfast
but
hope
to
meet
his
lordship
at
dinner
if
not
before
that
time
on
deck
the
answer
was
propitious
and
the
steward
soon
appeared
with
the
breakfast
in
the
ladies
cabin
well
maddox
said
cecilia
how
do
you
get
on
with
your
new
master
the
steward
looked
at
the
door
to
see
if
it
was
closed
shook
his
head
and
then
said
with
a
look
of
despair
he
has
ordered
a
haunch
of
venison
for
dinner
miss
and
he
has
twice
threatened
to
toss
me
overboard
you
must
obey
him
maddox
or
he
certainly
will
these
pirates
are
dreadful
fellows
be
attentive
and
serve
him
just
as
if
he
was
my
father
yes
yes
i
will
but
our
time
may
come
it
on
the
high
seas
and
i
go
fifty
miles
to
see
him
hanged
steward
cried
pickersgill
from
the
cabin
o
lord
he
ca
have
heard
me
d
he
did
miss
the
partitions
are
very
thin
and
you
spoke
very
loud
said
mrs
lascelles
at
all
events
go
to
him
quickly
miss
if
i
should
see
you
any
more
said
maddox
trembling
with
fear
as
he
obeyed
the
awful
summons
which
was
to
demand
a
miss
ossulton
would
not
touch
the
breakfast
not
so
mrs
lascelles
and
cecilia
who
ate
very
heartily
it
very
dull
to
be
shut
up
in
this
cabin
said
mrs
lascelles
come
cecilia
let
go
on
deck
and
leave
me
cried
miss
ossulton
there
is
phoebe
here
aunt
we
are
going
up
to
persuade
the
pirates
to
put
us
all
on
shore
mrs
lascelles
and
cecilia
put
on
their
bonnets
and
went
up
lord
took
off
his
hat
and
begged
the
honour
of
being
introduced
to
the
pretty
widow
he
handed
the
ladies
to
a
seat
and
then
commenced
conversing
upon
various
subjects
which
at
the
same
time
possessed
great
novelty
his
lordship
talked
about
france
and
described
its
ports
told
now
and
then
a
good
anecdote
pointed
out
the
different
headlands
bays
towns
and
villages
which
they
were
passing
rapidly
and
always
had
some
little
story
connected
with
each
before
the
ladies
had
been
two
hours
on
deck
they
found
themselves
to
their
infinite
surprise
not
only
interested
but
in
conversation
with
the
captain
of
the
smuggler
and
more
than
once
they
laughed
outright
but
the
lord
had
inspired
them
with
confidence
they
fully
believed
that
what
he
had
told
them
was
true
and
that
he
had
taken
possession
of
the
yacht
to
smuggle
his
goods
to
be
revenged
and
to
have
a
laugh
now
none
of
these
three
offences
are
capital
in
the
eyes
of
the
fair
sex
and
jack
was
a
handsome
fellow
of
excellent
manners
and
very
agreeable
conversation
at
the
same
time
neither
he
nor
his
friend
were
in
their
general
deportment
and
behaviour
otherwise
than
most
respectful
ladies
as
you
are
not
afraid
of
me
which
is
a
greater
happiness
than
i
had
reason
to
expect
i
think
you
may
be
amused
to
witness
the
fear
of
those
who
accuse
your
sex
of
cowardice
with
your
permission
i
will
send
for
the
cook
and
steward
and
inquire
about
the
dinner
i
should
like
to
know
what
there
is
for
dinner
observed
mrs
lascelles
demurely
would
you
cecilia
cecilia
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
mouth
tell
the
steward
and
the
cook
both
to
come
aft
immediately
cried
pickersgill
in
a
few
seconds
they
both
made
their
appearance
steward
cried
pickersgill
with
a
loud
voice
yes
my
lord
replied
maddox
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
what
wines
have
you
put
out
for
dinner
champagne
my
lord
and
claret
my
lord
and
madeira
and
sherry
my
lord
no
burgundy
sir
no
my
lord
there
is
no
burgundy
on
board
no
burgundy
sir
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
that
upon
my
soul
my
lord
cried
maddox
dropping
on
his
knees
there
is
no
burgundy
on
board
ask
the
ladies
very
well
sir
you
may
go
cook
what
have
you
got
for
dinner
sir
a
haunch
of
mutt
of
venison
my
lord
replied
the
cook
with
his
white
in
his
hand
what
else
sirrah
a
boiled
calf
head
my
lord
a
boiled
calf
head
let
it
be
roasted
or
i
roast
you
sir
cried
pickersgill
in
an
angry
tone
yes
my
lord
i
roast
it
and
what
else
sir
maintenon
cutlets
my
lord
maintenon
cutlets
i
hate
them
i
wo
have
them
sir
let
them
be
dressed
i
do
know
what
that
is
my
lord
i
do
care
for
that
sirrah
if
you
do
find
out
by
you
food
for
fishes
that
all
you
may
go
the
cook
walked
off
wringing
his
hands
and
his
as
well
for
he
still
held
it
in
his
right
hand
and
disappeared
down
the
i
have
done
this
to
pay
you
a
deserved
compliment
ladies
you
have
more
courage
than
the
other
sex
recollect
that
we
have
had
confidence
given
to
us
in
consequence
of
your
pledging
your
word
my
lord
you
do
me
then
the
honour
of
believing
me
i
did
not
until
i
saw
you
replied
mrs
lascelles
but
now
i
am
convinced
that
you
will
perform
your
promise
you
do
indeed
encourage
me
madam
to
pursue
what
is
right
said
pickersgill
bowing
for
your
approbation
i
should
be
most
sorry
to
lose
still
more
sorry
to
prove
myself
unworthy
of
it
as
the
reader
will
observe
everything
was
going
on
remarkably
well
chapter
vi
the
smuggling
yacht
cecilia
returned
to
the
cabin
to
ascertain
whether
her
aunt
was
more
composed
but
mrs
lascelles
remained
on
deck
she
was
much
pleased
with
pickersgill
and
they
continued
their
conversation
pickersgill
entered
into
a
defence
of
his
conduct
to
lord
and
mrs
lascelles
could
not
but
admit
the
provocation
after
a
long
conversation
she
hinted
at
his
profession
and
how
superior
he
appeared
to
be
to
such
a
lawless
life
you
may
be
incredulous
madam
replied
pickersgill
if
i
tell
you
that
i
have
as
good
a
right
to
quarter
my
arms
as
lord
himself
and
that
i
am
not
under
my
real
name
smuggling
is
at
all
events
no
crime
and
i
infinitely
prefer
the
wild
life
i
lead
at
the
head
of
my
men
to
being
spurned
by
society
because
i
am
poor
the
greatest
crime
in
this
country
is
poverty
i
may
if
i
am
fortunate
some
day
resume
my
name
you
may
perhaps
meet
me
and
if
you
please
you
may
expose
me
that
i
should
not
be
likely
to
do
replied
the
widow
but
still
i
regret
to
see
a
person
evidently
intended
for
better
things
employed
in
so
disreputable
a
profession
i
hardly
know
madam
what
is
and
what
is
not
disreputable
in
this
conventional
world
it
is
not
considered
disreputable
to
cringe
to
the
vices
of
a
court
or
to
accept
a
pension
wrung
from
the
industry
of
the
nation
in
return
for
base
servility
it
is
not
considered
disreputable
to
take
tithes
intended
for
the
service
of
god
and
lavish
them
away
at
or
elsewhere
seeking
pleasure
instead
of
doing
god
service
it
is
not
considered
disreputable
to
take
fee
after
fee
to
uphold
injustice
to
plead
against
innocence
to
pervert
truth
and
to
aid
the
devil
it
is
not
considered
disreputable
to
gamble
on
the
stock
exchange
or
to
corrupt
the
honesty
of
electors
by
bribes
to
doing
which
the
penalty
attached
is
equal
to
that
decreed
to
the
offence
of
which
i
am
guilty
all
these
and
much
more
are
not
considered
disreputable
yet
by
all
these
are
the
moral
bonds
of
society
loosened
while
in
mine
we
cause
no
guilt
in
others
but
still
it
is
a
crime
a
violation
of
the
revenue
laws
and
no
more
observe
madam
the
english
government
encourage
the
smuggling
of
our
manufactures
to
the
continent
at
the
same
time
that
they
take
every
step
to
prevent
articles
being
smuggled
into
this
country
now
madam
can
that
be
a
when
the
head
of
the
vessel
is
turned
north
which
becomes
when
she
steers
the
opposite
way
there
is
a
stigma
attached
to
it
you
must
allow
that
i
grant
you
madam
and
as
soon
as
i
can
quit
the
profession
i
shall
no
captive
ever
sighed
more
to
be
released
from
his
chains
but
i
will
not
leave
it
till
i
find
that
i
am
in
a
situation
not
to
be
spurned
and
neglected
by
those
with
whom
i
have
a
right
to
associate
at
this
moment
the
steward
was
seen
forward
making
signs
to
mrs
lascelles
who
excused
herself
and
went
to
him
for
the
love
of
god
madam
said
maddox
as
he
appears
to
be
friendly
with
you
do
pray
find
out
how
these
cutlets
are
to
be
dressed
the
cook
is
tearing
his
hair
and
we
shall
never
have
any
dinner
and
then
it
will
all
fall
upon
me
and
i
shall
be
tossed
overboard
mrs
lascelles
desired
poor
maddox
to
wait
there
while
she
obtained
the
desired
information
in
a
few
minutes
she
returned
to
him
i
have
found
it
out
they
are
first
to
be
boiled
in
vinegar
then
fried
in
batter
and
served
up
with
a
sauce
of
anchovy
and
malaga
raisins
first
fried
in
vinegar
then
boiled
in
batter
and
served
up
with
almonds
and
raisins
no
no
mrs
lascelles
repeated
the
injunction
to
the
frightened
steward
and
then
returned
aft
and
into
a
conversation
with
pickersgill
in
which
for
the
first
time
corbett
now
joined
corbett
had
sense
enough
to
feel
that
the
less
he
came
forward
until
his
superior
had
established
himself
in
the
good
graces
of
the
ladies
the
more
favourable
would
be
the
result
in
the
mean
time
cecilia
had
gone
down
to
her
aunt
who
still
continued
to
wail
and
lament
the
young
lady
tried
all
she
could
to
console
her
and
to
persuade
her
that
if
they
were
civil
and
obedient
they
had
nothing
to
fear
civil
and
obedient
indeed
cried
miss
ossulton
to
a
fellow
who
is
a
smuggler
and
a
pirate
i
the
sister
of
lord
never
the
presumption
of
the
wretch
that
is
all
very
well
aunt
but
recollect
we
must
submit
to
circumstances
these
men
insist
upon
our
dining
with
them
and
we
must
go
or
we
shall
have
no
dinner
i
sit
down
with
a
pirate
never
i
have
no
dinner
i
starve
die
but
my
dear
aunt
it
the
only
chance
we
have
of
obtaining
our
release
and
if
you
do
not
do
it
mrs
lascelles
will
think
that
you
wish
to
remain
with
them
mrs
lascelles
judges
of
other
people
by
herself
the
captain
is
certainly
a
very
handsome
man
he
looks
like
a
nobleman
in
disguise
what
an
odd
thing
it
would
be
aunt
if
this
should
be
all
a
hoax
a
hoax
child
replied
miss
ossulton
sitting
up
on
the
sofa
cecilia
found
that
she
had
hit
the
right
nail
as
the
saying
is
and
she
brought
forward
so
many
arguments
to
prove
that
she
thought
it
was
a
hoax
to
frighten
them
and
that
the
gentleman
above
was
a
man
of
consequence
that
her
aunt
began
to
listen
to
reason
and
at
last
consented
to
join
the
mrs
lascelles
now
came
down
below
and
when
dinner
was
announced
they
repaired
to
the
large
cabin
where
they
found
pickersgill
and
corbett
waiting
for
them
miss
ossulton
did
not
venture
to
look
up
until
she
heard
pickersgill
say
to
mrs
lascelles
perhaps
madam
you
will
do
me
the
favour
to
introduce
me
to
that
lady
whom
i
have
not
had
the
honour
of
seeing
before
certainly
my
lord
replied
mrs
lascelles
miss
ossulton
the
aunt
of
this
young
lady
mrs
lascelles
purposely
did
not
introduce
in
return
that
she
might
mystify
the
old
spinster
i
feel
highly
honoured
in
finding
myself
in
the
company
of
miss
ossulton
said
pickersgill
ladies
we
wait
but
for
you
to
sit
down
ossulton
take
the
head
of
the
table
and
serve
the
soup
miss
ossulton
was
astonished
she
looked
at
the
smugglers
and
perceived
two
gentlemanly
men
one
of
whom
was
apparently
a
lord
and
the
other
having
the
same
family
name
it
must
be
all
a
hoax
thought
she
and
she
very
quietly
took
to
her
soup
the
dinner
passed
off
very
pleasantly
pickersgill
was
agreeable
corbett
funny
and
miss
ossulton
so
far
recovered
herself
as
to
drink
wine
with
his
lordship
and
to
ask
corbett
what
branch
of
their
family
he
belonged
to
i
presume
it
the
irish
branch
said
mrs
lascelles
prompting
him
exactly
madam
replied
corbett
have
you
ever
been
to
torquay
ladies
inquired
pickersgill
no
my
lord
answered
mrs
lascelles
we
shall
anchor
there
in
the
course
of
an
hour
and
probably
remain
there
till
steward
bring
coffee
tell
the
cook
these
cutlets
were
remarkably
well
dressed
the
ladies
retired
to
the
cabin
miss
ossulton
was
now
convinced
that
it
was
all
a
hoax
but
said
she
i
shall
tell
lord
my
opinion
of
their
practical
jokes
when
he
returns
what
is
his
lordship
name
who
is
on
board
he
wo
tell
us
replied
mrs
lascelles
but
i
think
i
know
it
is
lord
blarney
lord
blaney
you
mean
i
presume
said
miss
ossulton
however
the
thing
is
carried
too
far
cecilia
we
will
go
on
shore
at
torquay
and
wait
till
the
yacht
returns
with
lord
i
do
like
these
jokes
they
may
do
very
well
for
widows
and
people
of
no
rank
now
mrs
lascelles
was
sorry
to
find
miss
ossulton
so
much
at
her
ease
she
owed
her
no
little
spite
and
wished
for
revenge
ladies
will
go
very
far
to
obtain
this
how
far
mrs
lascelles
would
have
gone
i
will
not
pretend
to
say
but
this
is
certain
that
the
last
innuendo
of
miss
ossulton
very
much
added
to
her
determination
she
took
her
bonnet
and
went
on
deck
at
once
told
pickersgill
that
he
could
not
please
her
or
cecilia
more
than
by
frightening
miss
ossulton
who
under
the
idea
that
it
was
all
a
hoax
had
quite
recovered
her
spirits
talked
of
her
pride
and
and
wished
her
to
receive
a
useful
lesson
thus
to
follow
up
her
revenge
did
mrs
lascelles
commit
herself
so
far
as
to
be
confidential
with
the
smuggler
in
return
mrs
lascelles
i
shall
be
able
to
obey
you
and
at
the
same
time
to
combine
business
with
pleasure
after
a
short
conversation
the
yacht
dropped
her
anchor
at
torquay
it
was
then
about
two
hours
before
sunset
as
soon
as
the
sails
were
furled
one
or
two
gentlemen
who
resided
there
came
on
board
to
pay
their
respects
to
lord
and
as
pickersgill
had
found
out
from
cecilia
that
her
father
was
acquainted
with
no
one
there
he
received
them
in
person
asked
them
down
in
the
cabin
called
for
wine
and
desired
them
to
send
their
boat
away
as
his
own
was
going
on
shore
the
smugglers
took
great
care
that
the
steward
cook
and
lady
maid
should
have
no
communication
with
the
guests
one
of
them
by
direction
being
a
sentinel
over
each
individual
the
gentlemen
remained
about
on
board
during
which
corbett
and
the
smugglers
had
filled
the
portmanteaus
found
in
the
cabin
with
the
lace
and
they
were
put
in
the
boat
corbett
then
landed
the
gentlemen
in
the
same
boat
and
went
up
to
the
hotel
the
smugglers
following
him
with
the
portmanteaus
without
any
suspicion
or
interruption
as
soon
as
he
was
there
he
ordered
and
set
off
for
a
town
close
by
where
he
had
correspondents
and
thus
the
major
part
of
the
cargo
was
secured
corbett
then
returned
in
the
night
bringing
with
him
people
to
receive
the
goods
and
the
smugglers
landed
the
silks
teas
with
the
same
good
fortune
everything
was
out
of
the
yacht
except
a
portion
of
the
lace
which
the
portmanteaus
would
not
hold
pickersgill
might
easily
have
sent
this
on
shore
but
to
please
mrs
lascelles
he
arranged
otherwise
the
next
morning
about
an
hour
after
breakfast
was
finished
mrs
lascelles
entered
the
cabin
pretending
to
be
in
the
greatest
consternation
and
fell
on
the
sofa
as
if
she
were
going
to
faint
good
heavens
what
is
the
matter
exclaimed
cecilia
who
knew
very
well
what
was
coming
oh
the
wretch
he
has
made
such
proposals
proposals
what
proposals
what
lord
blaney
cried
miss
ossulton
oh
he
no
lord
he
a
villain
and
a
smuggler
and
he
insists
that
we
shall
both
fill
our
pockets
full
of
lace
and
go
on
shore
with
him
mercy
on
me
then
it
is
no
hoax
after
all
and
i
been
sitting
down
to
dinner
with
a
smuggler
sitting
down
madam
if
it
were
to
be
no
more
than
that
but
we
are
to
take
his
arm
up
to
the
hotel
oh
dear
cecilia
i
am
ordered
on
deck
pray
come
with
me
miss
ossulton
rolled
on
the
sofa
and
rang
for
phoebe
she
was
in
a
state
of
great
alarm
a
knock
at
the
door
come
in
said
miss
ossulton
thinking
it
was
phoebe
when
pickersgill
made
his
appearance
what
do
you
want
sir
go
out
sir
go
out
directly
or
i
scream
it
is
no
use
screaming
madam
recollect
that
all
on
board
are
at
my
service
you
will
oblige
me
by
listening
to
me
miss
ossulton
i
am
as
you
know
a
smuggler
and
i
must
send
this
lace
on
shore
you
will
oblige
me
by
putting
it
into
your
pockets
or
about
your
person
and
prepare
to
go
on
shore
with
me
as
soon
as
we
arrive
at
the
hotel
you
will
deliver
it
to
me
and
i
then
shall
reconduct
you
on
board
of
the
yacht
you
are
not
the
first
lady
who
has
gone
on
shore
with
contraband
articles
about
her
person
me
sir
go
on
shore
in
that
way
no
sir
never
what
will
the
world
say
the
hon
miss
ossulton
walking
with
a
smuggler
no
sir
never
yes
madam
walking
with
a
smuggler
i
shall
have
you
on
one
arm
and
mrs
lascelles
on
the
other
and
i
would
advise
you
to
take
it
very
quietly
for
in
the
first
place
it
will
be
you
who
smuggle
as
the
goods
will
be
found
on
your
person
and
you
will
certainly
be
put
in
prison
for
at
the
least
appearance
of
insubordination
we
run
and
inform
against
you
and
further
your
niece
will
remain
on
board
as
a
hostage
for
your
good
behaviour
and
if
you
have
any
regard
for
her
liberty
you
will
consent
immediately
pickersgill
left
the
cabin
and
shortly
afterwards
cecilia
and
mrs
lascelles
entered
apparently
much
distressed
they
had
been
informed
of
all
and
mrs
lascelles
declared
that
for
her
part
sooner
than
leave
her
poor
cecilia
to
the
mercy
of
such
people
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
submit
to
the
smuggler
demands
cecilia
also
begged
so
earnestly
that
miss
ossulton
who
had
no
idea
that
it
was
a
trick
with
much
sobbing
and
blubbering
consented
when
all
was
ready
cecilia
left
the
cabin
pickersgill
came
down
handed
up
the
two
ladies
who
had
not
exchanged
a
word
with
each
other
during
cecilia
absence
the
boat
was
ready
alongside
they
went
in
and
pulled
on
shore
everything
succeeded
to
the
satisfaction
miss
ossulton
frightened
out
of
her
wits
took
his
arm
and
with
mrs
lascelles
on
the
other
they
went
up
to
the
hotel
followed
by
four
of
his
boat
crew
as
soon
as
they
were
shown
into
a
room
corbett
who
was
already
on
shore
asked
for
lord
and
joined
them
the
ladies
retired
to
another
apartment
divested
themselves
of
their
contraband
goods
and
after
calling
for
some
sandwiches
and
wine
pickersgill
waited
an
hour
and
then
returned
on
board
mrs
lascelles
was
triumphant
and
she
rewarded
her
new
ally
the
smuggler
with
one
of
her
sweetest
smiles
community
of
interest
will
sometimes
make
strange
friendships
chapter
vii
conclusion
we
must
now
return
to
the
other
parties
who
have
assisted
in
the
acts
of
this
little
drama
lord
after
paddling
and
paddling
the
men
relieving
each
other
in
order
to
make
head
against
the
wind
which
was
off
shore
arrived
about
midnight
at
a
small
town
in
west
bay
from
whence
he
took
a
chaise
on
to
portsmouth
taking
it
for
granted
that
his
yacht
would
arrive
as
soon
as
if
not
before
himself
little
imagining
that
it
was
in
possession
of
the
smugglers
there
he
remained
three
or
four
days
when
becoming
impatient
he
applied
to
one
of
his
friends
who
had
a
yacht
at
cowes
and
sailed
with
him
to
look
after
his
own
we
left
the
chased
by
the
revenue
cutter
at
first
the
smuggler
had
the
advantage
before
the
wind
but
by
degrees
the
wind
went
round
with
the
sun
and
brought
the
revenue
cutter
to
leeward
it
was
then
a
chase
on
a
wind
and
the
revenue
cutter
came
fast
up
with
her
morrison
perceiving
that
he
had
no
chance
of
escape
let
run
the
ankers
of
brandy
that
he
might
not
be
condemned
but
still
he
was
in
an
awkward
situation
as
he
had
more
men
on
board
than
allowed
by
act
of
parliament
he
therefore
stood
on
notwithstanding
the
shot
of
the
cutter
went
over
and
over
him
hoping
that
a
fog
or
night
might
enable
him
to
escape
but
he
had
no
such
good
fortune
one
of
the
shot
carried
away
the
head
of
his
mast
and
the
luck
was
all
over
he
was
boarded
and
taken
possession
of
he
asserted
that
the
extra
men
were
only
passengers
but
in
the
first
place
they
were
dressed
in
seamen
clothes
and
in
the
second
as
soon
as
the
boat
was
aboard
of
her
appleboy
had
gone
down
to
his
and
was
not
to
be
disturbed
the
gentlemen
smugglers
therefore
passed
an
uncomfortable
night
and
the
cutter
going
to
portland
by
daylight
before
appleboy
was
out
of
bed
they
were
taken
on
shore
to
the
magistrate
hautaine
explained
the
whole
affair
and
they
were
immediately
released
and
treated
with
respect
but
they
were
not
permitted
to
depart
until
they
were
bound
over
to
appear
against
the
smugglers
and
prove
the
brandy
having
been
on
board
they
then
set
off
for
portsmouth
in
the
clothes
having
had
quite
enough
of
yachting
for
that
season
mr
ossulton
declaring
that
he
only
wanted
to
get
his
luggage
and
then
he
would
take
care
how
he
put
himself
again
in
the
way
of
the
shot
of
a
revenue
cruiser
or
of
sleeping
a
night
on
her
decks
in
the
mean
time
morrison
and
his
men
were
locked
up
in
the
jail
the
old
man
as
the
key
was
turned
on
him
exclaiming
as
he
raised
his
foot
in
vexation
that
cursed
blue
pigeon
we
will
now
return
to
the
yacht
about
an
hour
after
pickersgill
had
come
on
board
corbett
had
made
all
his
arrangements
and
followed
him
it
was
not
advisable
to
remain
at
torquay
any
longer
through
fear
of
discovery
he
therefore
weighed
the
anchor
before
dinner
and
made
sail
what
do
you
intend
to
do
now
my
lord
said
mrs
lascelles
i
intend
to
run
down
to
cowes
anchor
the
yacht
in
the
night
and
an
hour
before
daylight
have
you
in
my
boat
with
all
my
men
i
will
take
care
that
you
are
in
perfect
safety
depend
upon
it
even
if
i
run
a
risk
i
should
indeed
be
miserable
if
through
my
wild
freaks
any
accident
should
happen
to
mrs
lascelles
or
miss
ossulton
i
am
very
anxious
about
my
father
observed
cecilia
i
trust
that
you
will
keep
your
promise
i
always
have
hitherto
miss
ossulton
have
i
not
ours
is
but
a
short
and
strange
acquaintance
i
grant
it
but
it
will
serve
for
you
to
talk
about
long
after
i
shall
disappear
as
suddenly
as
i
have
come
you
will
neither
of
you
in
all
probability
ever
see
me
again
the
dinner
was
announced
and
they
sat
down
to
table
as
before
but
the
elderly
spinster
refused
to
make
her
appearance
and
mrs
lascelles
and
cecilia
who
thought
she
had
been
frightened
enough
did
not
attempt
to
force
her
pickersgill
immediately
yielded
to
these
remonstrances
and
from
that
time
she
remained
undisturbed
in
the
ladies
cabin
meditating
over
the
indignity
of
having
sat
down
to
table
having
drank
wine
and
been
obliged
to
walk
on
shore
taking
the
arm
of
a
smuggler
and
appear
in
such
a
humiliating
situation
the
wind
was
light
and
they
made
but
little
progress
and
were
not
abreast
of
portland
till
the
second
day
when
another
yacht
appeared
in
sight
and
the
two
vessels
slowly
neared
until
in
the
afternoon
they
were
within
four
miles
of
each
other
it
then
fell
a
dead
calm
signals
were
thrown
out
by
the
other
yacht
but
could
not
be
distinguished
and
for
the
last
time
they
sat
down
to
dinner
three
days
companionship
on
board
of
a
vessel
cooped
up
together
and
having
no
one
else
to
converse
with
will
produce
intimacy
and
pickersgill
was
a
young
man
of
so
much
originality
and
information
that
he
was
listened
to
with
pleasure
he
never
attempted
to
advance
beyond
the
line
of
strict
decorum
and
politeness
and
his
companion
was
equally
unpresuming
situated
as
they
were
and
feeling
what
must
have
been
the
case
had
they
fallen
into
other
hands
both
cecilia
and
mrs
lascelles
felt
some
degree
of
gratitude
towards
him
and
although
anxious
to
be
relieved
from
so
strange
a
position
they
had
gradually
acquired
a
perfect
confidence
in
him
and
this
had
produced
a
degree
of
familiarity
on
their
parts
although
never
ventured
upon
by
the
smuggler
as
corbett
was
at
the
table
one
of
the
men
came
down
and
made
a
sign
corbett
shortly
after
quitted
the
table
and
went
on
deck
i
wish
my
lord
you
would
come
up
a
moment
and
see
if
you
can
make
this
flag
out
said
corbett
giving
a
significant
nod
to
pickersgill
excuse
me
ladies
one
moment
said
pickersgill
who
went
on
deck
it
is
the
boat
of
the
yacht
coming
on
board
said
corbett
and
lord
is
in
the
with
the
gentleman
who
was
with
him
and
how
many
men
in
the
boat
let
me
see
only
four
well
let
his
lordship
and
his
friend
come
when
they
are
on
the
deck
have
the
men
ready
in
case
of
accident
but
if
you
can
manage
to
tell
the
boat
crew
that
they
are
to
go
on
board
again
and
get
rid
of
them
that
way
so
much
the
better
arrange
this
with
adams
and
then
come
down
again
his
lordship
must
see
us
all
at
dinner
pickersgill
then
descended
and
corbett
had
hardly
time
to
give
his
directions
and
to
resume
his
seat
before
his
lordship
and
mr
stewart
pulled
up
alongside
and
jumped
on
deck
there
was
no
one
to
receive
them
but
the
seamen
and
those
whom
they
did
not
know
they
looked
round
in
amazement
at
last
his
lordship
said
to
adams
who
stood
forward
what
men
are
you
belong
to
the
yacht
honour
lord
heard
laughing
in
the
cabin
he
would
not
wait
to
interrogate
the
men
he
walked
aft
followed
by
mr
stewart
looked
down
the
skylight
and
perceived
his
daughter
and
mrs
lascelles
with
as
he
supposed
hautaine
and
ossulton
pickersgill
had
heard
the
boat
rub
the
side
and
the
sound
of
the
feet
on
deck
and
he
talked
the
more
loudly
that
the
ladies
might
be
caught
by
lord
as
they
were
he
heard
their
feet
at
the
skylight
and
knew
that
they
could
hear
what
passed
and
at
that
moment
he
proposed
to
the
ladies
that
as
this
was
their
last
meeting
at
table
they
should
all
take
a
glass
of
champagne
to
drink
to
their
happy
meeting
with
lord
b
this
was
a
toast
which
they
did
not
refuse
maddox
poured
out
the
wine
and
they
were
all
bowing
to
each
other
when
his
lordship
who
had
come
down
the
ladder
walked
into
the
cabin
followed
by
mr
stewart
cecilia
perceived
her
father
the
dropped
from
her
hand
she
flew
into
his
arms
and
burst
into
tears
who
would
not
be
a
father
mrs
lascelles
said
pickersgill
quietly
seating
himself
after
having
first
risen
to
receive
lord
b
and
pray
whom
may
i
have
the
honour
of
finding
established
here
said
lord
in
an
angry
tone
speaking
over
his
daughter
head
who
still
lay
in
his
arms
by
heavens
yes
stewart
it
is
the
smuggling
captain
dressed
out
even
so
my
lord
replied
pickersgill
you
abandoned
your
yacht
to
capture
me
you
left
these
ladies
in
a
vessel
crippled
for
want
of
men
they
might
have
been
lost
i
have
returned
good
for
evil
by
coming
on
board
with
my
own
people
and
taking
charge
of
them
this
night
i
expected
to
have
anchored
your
vessel
in
cowes
and
have
left
them
in
safety
by
the
cried
stewart
stop
sir
if
you
please
cried
pickersgill
recollect
you
have
once
already
attacked
one
who
never
offended
oblige
me
by
refraining
from
intemperate
language
for
i
tell
you
i
will
not
put
up
with
it
recollect
sir
that
i
have
refrained
from
that
and
also
from
taking
advantage
of
you
when
you
were
in
my
power
recollect
sir
also
that
the
yacht
is
still
in
possession
of
the
smugglers
and
that
you
are
in
no
condition
to
insult
with
impunity
my
lord
allow
me
to
observe
that
we
men
are
too
hot
of
temperament
to
argue
or
listen
coolly
with
your
permission
your
friend
and
my
friend
and
i
will
repair
on
deck
leaving
you
to
hear
from
your
daughter
and
that
lady
all
that
has
passed
after
that
my
lord
i
shall
be
most
happy
to
hear
anything
which
your
lordship
may
please
to
say
upon
my
word
commenced
mr
stewart
mr
stewart
interrupted
cecilia
ossulton
i
request
your
silence
nay
more
if
ever
we
are
again
to
sail
in
the
same
vessel
together
i
upon
it
your
lordship
will
oblige
me
by
enforcing
miss
ossulton
request
said
mrs
lascelles
mr
stewart
was
dumbfounded
no
wonder
to
find
the
ladies
siding
with
the
smuggler
i
am
obliged
to
you
ladies
for
your
interference
said
pickersgill
for
although
i
have
the
means
of
enforcing
conditions
i
should
be
sorry
to
avail
myself
of
them
i
wait
for
his
lordship
reply
lord
was
very
much
surprised
he
wished
for
an
explanation
he
bowed
with
everybody
appeared
to
be
in
a
false
position
even
he
lord
somehow
or
another
had
bowed
to
a
smuggler
pickersgill
and
stewart
went
on
deck
walking
up
and
down
crossing
each
other
without
speaking
but
reminding
you
of
two
dogs
who
both
are
anxious
to
fight
but
have
been
restrained
by
the
voice
of
their
masters
corbett
followed
and
talked
in
a
low
tone
to
pickersgill
stewart
went
over
to
leeward
to
see
if
the
boat
was
still
alongside
but
it
had
long
before
returned
to
the
yacht
miss
ossulton
had
heard
her
brother
voice
but
did
not
come
out
of
the
she
wished
to
be
magnificent
and
at
the
same
time
she
was
not
sure
whether
all
was
right
phoebe
having
informed
her
that
there
was
nobody
with
her
brother
and
mr
stewart
and
that
the
smugglers
still
had
the
command
of
the
vessel
after
a
while
pickersgill
and
corbett
went
down
forward
and
returned
dressed
in
the
smuggler
clothes
when
they
resumed
their
walk
on
the
deck
in
the
mean
time
it
was
dark
the
cutter
flew
along
the
coast
and
the
needles
lights
were
on
the
larboard
bow
the
conversation
between
cecilia
mrs
lascelles
and
her
father
was
long
when
all
had
been
detailed
and
the
conduct
of
pickersgill
duly
represented
lord
acknowledged
that
by
attacking
the
smuggler
he
had
laid
himself
open
to
retaliation
that
pickersgill
had
shown
a
great
deal
of
forbearance
in
every
instance
and
after
all
had
he
not
gone
on
board
the
yacht
she
might
have
been
lost
with
only
three
seamen
on
board
he
was
amused
with
the
smuggling
and
the
fright
of
his
sister
still
more
with
the
gentlemen
being
sent
to
cherbourg
and
much
consoled
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
to
be
laughed
at
he
was
also
much
pleased
with
intention
of
leaving
the
yacht
safe
in
cowes
harbour
his
respect
to
the
property
on
board
and
his
conduct
to
the
ladies
on
the
whole
he
felt
grateful
to
pickersgill
and
where
there
is
gratitude
there
is
always
good
will
but
who
can
he
be
said
mrs
lascelles
his
name
he
acknowledges
not
to
be
pickersgill
and
he
told
me
confidentially
that
he
was
of
good
family
confidentially
my
dear
mrs
lascelles
said
lord
b
oh
yes
we
are
both
his
confidants
are
we
not
cecilia
upon
my
honour
mrs
lascelles
this
smuggler
appears
to
have
made
an
impression
which
many
have
attempted
in
vain
mrs
lascelles
did
not
reply
to
that
remark
but
said
now
my
lord
you
must
decide
and
i
trust
you
will
to
oblige
us
treat
him
as
he
has
treated
us
with
the
greatest
respect
and
kindness
why
should
you
suppose
otherwise
replied
lord
it
is
not
only
my
wish
but
my
interest
so
to
do
he
may
take
us
over
to
france
or
anywhere
else
has
he
not
possession
of
the
vessel
yes
replied
cecilia
but
we
flatter
ourselves
that
we
have
shall
we
call
him
down
papa
ring
for
maddox
maddox
tell
mr
pickersgill
who
is
on
deck
that
i
wish
to
speak
with
him
and
shall
be
obliged
by
his
stepping
down
into
the
cabin
who
my
lord
what
yes
replied
cecilia
laughing
must
i
call
him
my
lord
now
miss
you
may
do
as
you
please
maddox
but
recollect
he
is
still
in
possession
of
the
vessel
replied
cecilia
then
with
your
lordship
permission
i
will
it
the
safest
way
the
smuggler
entered
the
cabin
the
ladies
started
as
he
appeared
in
his
rough
costume
with
his
throat
open
and
his
loose
black
handkerchief
he
was
the
of
a
handsome
sailor
your
lordship
wishes
to
communicate
with
me
mr
pickersgill
i
feel
that
you
have
had
cause
of
enmity
against
me
and
that
you
have
behaved
with
forbearance
i
thank
you
for
your
considerate
treatment
of
the
ladies
and
i
assure
you
that
i
feel
no
resentment
for
what
has
passed
my
lord
i
am
quite
satisfied
with
what
you
have
said
and
i
only
hope
that
in
future
you
will
not
interfere
with
a
poor
smuggler
who
may
be
striving
by
a
life
of
danger
and
privation
to
procure
subsistence
for
himself
and
perhaps
his
family
i
stated
to
these
ladies
my
intention
of
anchoring
the
yacht
this
night
at
cowes
and
leaving
her
as
soon
as
she
was
in
safety
your
unexpected
presence
will
only
make
this
difference
which
is
that
i
must
previously
obtain
your
assurance
that
those
with
you
will
allow
me
and
my
men
to
quit
her
without
molestation
after
we
have
performed
this
service
i
pledge
you
my
word
mr
pickersgill
and
i
thank
you
into
the
bargain
i
trust
you
will
allow
me
to
offer
some
remuneration
most
certainly
not
my
lord
at
all
events
mr
pickersgill
if
at
any
other
time
i
can
be
of
service
you
may
command
me
pickersgill
made
no
reply
surely
mr
pickersgill
pickersgill
how
i
hate
that
name
said
the
smuggler
musing
i
beg
your
lordship
pardon
if
i
may
require
your
assistance
for
any
of
my
unfortunate
companions
not
for
yourself
mr
pickersgill
said
mrs
lascelles
madam
i
smuggle
no
more
for
the
pleasure
i
feel
in
hearing
that
resolution
mr
pickersgill
said
cecilia
take
my
hand
and
thanks
and
mine
said
mrs
lascelles
half
crying
and
mine
too
said
lord
rising
up
pickersgill
passed
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
turned
round
and
left
the
cabin
i
so
happy
said
mrs
lascelles
bursting
into
tears
he
a
magnificent
fellow
observed
lord
b
come
let
us
all
go
on
deck
you
have
not
seen
my
aunt
papa
true
i
go
in
to
her
and
then
follow
you
the
ladies
went
upon
deck
cecilia
entered
into
conversation
with
mr
stewart
giving
him
a
narrative
of
what
had
happened
mrs
lascelles
sat
abaft
at
the
taffrail
with
her
pretty
hand
supporting
her
cheek
looking
very
much
la
mrs
lascelles
said
pickersgill
before
we
part
allow
me
to
observe
that
it
is
who
have
induced
me
to
give
up
my
profession
why
me
mr
pickersgill
you
said
that
you
did
not
like
it
mrs
lascelles
felt
the
force
of
the
compliment
you
said
just
now
that
you
hated
the
name
of
pickersgill
why
do
you
call
yourself
so
it
was
my
smuggling
name
mrs
lascelles
and
now
that
you
have
left
off
smuggling
pray
what
may
be
the
name
we
are
to
call
you
by
i
can
not
resume
it
till
i
have
not
only
left
this
vessel
but
shaken
hands
with
and
bid
farewell
to
my
companions
and
by
that
time
mrs
lascelles
i
shall
be
away
from
you
but
i
a
great
curiosity
to
know
it
and
a
lady
curiosity
must
be
gratified
you
must
call
upon
me
some
day
and
tell
it
me
here
is
my
address
pickersgill
received
the
card
with
a
low
bow
and
lord
coming
on
deck
mrs
lascelles
hastened
to
meet
him
the
vessel
was
now
passing
the
bridge
at
the
needles
and
the
smuggler
piloted
her
on
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
and
well
inside
the
whole
party
went
down
into
the
cabin
lord
requesting
pickersgill
and
corbett
to
join
him
in
a
parting
glass
mr
stewart
who
had
received
the
account
of
what
had
passed
from
cecilia
was
very
attentive
to
pickersgill
and
took
an
opportunity
of
saying
that
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
said
or
done
anything
to
annoy
him
every
one
recovered
his
spirits
and
all
was
good
humour
and
mirth
because
miss
ossulton
adhered
to
her
resolution
of
not
quitting
the
cabin
till
she
could
quit
the
yacht
at
ten
the
yacht
was
anchored
pickersgill
took
his
leave
of
the
honourable
company
and
went
in
his
boat
with
his
men
and
lord
was
again
in
possession
of
his
vessel
although
he
had
not
a
ship
company
maddox
recovered
his
usual
tone
and
the
cook
flourished
his
knife
swearing
that
he
should
like
to
see
the
smuggler
who
would
again
order
him
to
dress
cutlets
the
yacht
had
remained
three
days
at
cowes
when
lord
received
a
letter
from
pickersgill
stating
that
the
men
of
his
vessel
had
been
captured
and
would
be
condemned
in
consequence
of
their
having
the
gentlemen
on
board
who
were
bound
to
appear
against
them
to
prove
that
they
had
sunk
the
brandy
lord
paid
all
the
recognisances
and
the
men
were
liberated
for
want
of
evidence
it
was
about
two
years
after
this
that
cecilia
ossulton
who
was
sitting
at
her
in
deep
mourning
for
her
aunt
was
presented
with
a
letter
by
the
butler
it
was
from
her
friend
mrs
lascelles
informing
her
that
she
was
married
again
to
a
mr
davenant
and
intended
to
pay
her
a
short
visit
on
her
way
to
the
continent
mr
and
mrs
davenant
arrived
the
next
day
and
when
the
latter
introduced
her
husband
she
said
to
miss
ossulton
look
cecilia
dear
and
tell
me
if
you
have
ever
seen
davenant
before
cecilia
looked
earnestly
i
have
indeed
cried
she
at
last
extending
her
hand
with
warmth
and
happy
am
i
to
meet
with
him
again
for
in
mr
davenant
she
recognised
her
old
acquaintance
the
captain
of
the
jack
pickersgill
the
smuggler

end
