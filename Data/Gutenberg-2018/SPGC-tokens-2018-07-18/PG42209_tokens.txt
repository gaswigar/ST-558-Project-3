in
weird

august
extensive
research
did
not
uncover
any
evidence
that
the
copyright
on
this
publication
was
renewed
the
fisherman
loosened
his
knife
in
its
scabbard
the
gesture
was
instinctive
for
what
he
feared
was
nothing
a
knife
could
slay
not
even
the
crescent
blade
of
the
yuetshi
that
could
disembowel
a
man
with
an
upward
stroke
neither
man
nor
beast
threatened
him
in
the
solitude
which
brooded
over
the
castellated
isle
of
xapur
he
had
climbed
the
cliffs
passed
through
the
jungle
that
bordered
them
and
now
stood
surrounded
by
evidences
of
a
vanished
state
broken
columns
glimmered
among
the
trees
the
straggling
lines
of
crumbling
walls
meandered
off
into
the
shadows
and
under
his
feet
were
broad
paves
cracked
and
bowed
by
roots
growing
beneath
the
fisherman
was
typical
of
his
race
that
strange
people
whose
origin
is
lost
in
the
gray
dawn
of
the
past
and
who
have
dwelt
in
their
rude
fishing
huts
along
the
southern
shore
of
the
sea
of
vilayet
since
time
immemorial
he
was
broadly
built
with
long
apish
arms
and
a
mighty
chest
but
with
lean
loins
and
thin
bandy
legs
his
face
was
broad
his
forehead
low
and
retreating
his
hair
thick
and
tangled
a
belt
for
a
knife
and
a
rag
for
a
were
all
he
wore
in
the
way
of
clothing
that
he
was
where
he
was
proved
that
he
was
less
dully
incurious
than
most
of
his
people
men
seldom
visited
xapur
it
was
uninhabited
all
but
forgotten
merely
one
among
the
myriad
isles
which
dotted
the
great
inland
sea
men
called
it
xapur
the
fortified
because
of
its
ruins
remnants
of
some
prehistoric
kingdom
lost
and
forgotten
before
the
conquering
hyborians
had
ridden
southward
none
knew
who
reared
those
stones
though
dim
legends
lingered
among
the
yuetshi
which
half
intelligibly
suggested
a
connection
of
immeasurable
antiquity
between
the
fishers
and
the
unknown
island
kingdom
but
it
had
been
a
thousand
years
since
any
yuetshi
had
understood
the
import
of
these
tales
they
repeated
them
now
as
a
meaningless
formula
a
gibberish
framed
by
their
lips
by
custom
no
yuetshi
had
come
to
xapur
for
a
century
the
adjacent
coast
of
the
mainland
was
uninhabited
a
reedy
marsh
given
over
to
the
grim
beasts
that
haunted
it
the
village
lay
some
distance
to
the
south
on
the
mainland
a
storm
had
blown
his
frail
fishing
craft
far
from
his
accustomed
haunts
and
wrecked
it
in
a
night
of
flaring
lightning
and
roaring
waters
on
the
towering
cliffs
of
the
isle
now
in
the
dawn
the
sky
shone
blue
and
clear
the
rising
sun
made
jewels
of
the
dripping
leaves
he
had
climbed
the
cliffs
to
which
he
had
clung
through
the
night
because
in
the
midst
of
the
storm
he
had
seen
an
appalling
lance
of
lightning
fork
out
of
the
black
heavens
and
the
concussion
of
its
stroke
which
had
shaken
the
whole
island
had
been
accompanied
by
a
cataclysmic
crash
that
he
doubted
could
have
resulted
from
a
riven
tree
a
dull
curiosity
had
caused
him
to
investigate
and
now
he
had
found
what
he
sought
and
an
uneasiness
possessed
him
a
sense
of
lurking
peril
among
the
trees
reared
a
broken
structure
built
of
gigantic
blocks
of
the
peculiar
green
stone
found
only
on
the
islands
of
vilayet
it
seemed
incredible
that
human
hands
could
have
shaped
and
placed
them
and
certainly
it
was
beyond
human
power
to
have
overthrown
the
structure
they
formed
but
the
thunderbolt
had
splintered
the
blocks
like
so
much
glass
reduced
others
to
green
dust
and
ripped
away
the
whole
arch
of
the
dome
the
fisherman
climbed
over
the
debris
and
peered
in
and
what
he
saw
brought
a
grunt
from
him
within
the
ruined
dome
surrounded
by
and
bits
of
broken
masonry
lay
a
man
on
the
golden
block
he
was
clad
in
a
sort
of
skirt
and
a
shagreen
girdle
his
black
hair
which
fell
in
a
square
mane
to
his
massive
shoulders
was
confined
about
his
temples
by
a
narrow
gold
band
on
his
bare
muscular
breast
lay
a
curious
dagger
with
a
jeweled
pommel
hilt
and
a
broad
crescent
blade
it
was
much
like
the
knife
the
fisherman
wore
at
his
hip
but
it
lacked
the
serrated
edge
and
was
made
with
infinitely
greater
skill
the
fisherman
lusted
for
the
weapon
the
man
of
course
was
dead
had
been
dead
for
many
centuries
this
dome
was
his
tomb
the
fisherman
did
not
wonder
by
what
art
the
ancients
had
preserved
the
body
in
such
a
vivid
likeness
of
life
which
kept
the
muscular
limbs
full
and
unshrunken
the
dark
flesh
vital
the
dull
brain
of
the
yuetshi
had
room
only
for
his
desire
for
the
knife
with
its
delicate
waving
lines
along
the
dully
gleaming
blade
scrambling
down
into
the
dome
he
lifted
the
weapon
from
the
breast
and
as
he
did
so
a
strange
and
terrible
thing
came
to
pass
the
muscular
dark
hands
knotted
convulsively
the
lids
flared
open
revealing
great
dark
magnetic
eyes
whose
stare
struck
the
startled
fisherman
like
a
physical
blow
he
recoiled
dropping
the
jeweled
dagger
in
his
perturbation
the
man
on
the
dais
heaved
up
to
a
sitting
position
and
the
fisherman
gaped
at
the
full
extent
of
his
size
thus
revealed
his
narrowed
eyes
held
the
yuetshi
and
in
those
slitted
orbs
he
read
neither
friendliness
nor
gratitude
he
saw
only
a
fire
as
alien
and
hostile
as
that
which
burns
in
the
eyes
of
a
tiger
suddenly
the
man
rose
and
towered
above
him
menace
in
his
every
aspect
there
was
no
room
in
the
fisherman
dull
brain
for
fear
at
least
for
such
fear
as
might
grip
a
man
who
has
just
seen
the
fundamental
laws
of
nature
defied
as
the
great
hands
fell
to
his
shoulders
he
drew
his
knife
and
struck
upward
with
the
same
motion
the
blade
splintered
against
the
stranger
corded
belly
as
against
a
steel
column
and
then
the
fisherman
thick
neck
broke
like
a
rotten
twig
in
the
giant
hands
jehungir
agha
lord
of
khawarizm
and
keeper
of
the
coastal
border
scanned
once
more
the
ornate
parchment
scroll
with
its
peacock
seal
and
laughed
shortly
and
sardonically
bluntly
demanded
his
counsellor
ghaznavi
jehungir
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
the
merciless
pride
of
birth
and
accomplishment
king
grows
short
of
patience
said
he
his
own
hand
he
complains
bitterly
of
what
he
calls
my
failure
to
guard
the
frontier
by
tarim
if
i
can
not
deal
a
blow
to
these
robbers
of
the
steppes
khawarizm
may
own
a
new
lord
ghaznavi
tugged
his
beard
in
meditation
yezdigerd
king
of
turan
was
the
mightiest
monarch
in
the
world
in
his
palace
in
the
great
port
city
of
aghrapur
was
heaped
the
plunder
of
empires
his
fleets
of
war
galleys
had
made
vilayet
an
hyrkanian
lake
the
people
of
zamora
paid
him
tribute
as
did
the
eastern
provinces
of
koth
the
shemites
bowed
to
his
rule
as
far
west
as
shushan
his
armies
ravaged
the
borders
of
stygia
in
the
south
and
the
snowy
lands
of
the
hyperboreans
in
the
north
his
riders
bore
torch
and
sword
westward
into
brythunia
and
ophir
and
corinthia
even
to
the
borders
of
nemedia
his
swordsmen
had
trampled
hosts
under
their
horses
hoofs
and
walled
cities
went
up
in
flames
at
his
command
in
the
glutted
slave
markets
of
aghrapur
sultanapur
khawarizm
shahpur
and
khorusun
women
were
sold
for
three
small
silver
coins
blond
brythunians
tawny
stygians
zamorians
ebon
kushites
shemites
yet
while
his
swift
horsemen
overthrew
armies
far
from
his
frontiers
at
his
very
borders
an
audacious
foe
plucked
his
beard
with
a
and
hand
on
the
broad
steppes
between
the
sea
of
vilayet
and
the
borders
of
the
easternmost
hyborian
kingdoms
a
new
race
had
sprung
up
in
the
past
formed
originally
of
fleeing
criminals
broken
men
escaped
slaves
and
deserting
soldiers
they
were
men
of
many
crimes
and
countries
some
born
on
the
steppes
some
fleeing
from
the
kingdoms
in
the
west
they
were
called
which
means
wastrel
dwelling
on
the
wild
open
steppes
owning
no
law
but
their
own
peculiar
code
they
had
become
a
people
capable
of
defying
the
grand
monarch
ceaselessly
they
raided
the
turanian
frontier
retiring
in
the
steppes
when
defeated
with
the
pirates
of
vilayet
men
of
much
the
same
breed
they
harried
the
coast
preying
off
the
merchant
ships
which
plied
between
the
hyrkanian
ports
am
i
to
crush
these
wolves
demanded
jehungir
i
follow
them
into
the
steppes
i
run
the
risk
either
of
being
cut
off
and
destroyed
or
having
them
elude
me
entirely
and
burn
the
city
in
my
absence
of
late
they
have
been
more
daring
than
ever
is
because
of
the
new
chief
who
has
risen
among
them
answered
ghaznavi
know
whom
i
mean
replied
jehungir
feelingly
is
that
devil
conan
he
is
even
wilder
than
the
yet
he
is
crafty
as
a
mountain
lion
is
more
through
wild
animal
instinct
than
through
intelligence
answered
ghaznavi
other
are
at
least
descendants
of
civilized
men
he
is
a
barbarian
but
to
dispose
of
him
would
be
to
deal
them
a
crippling
blow
how
demanded
jehungir
has
repeatedly
cut
his
way
out
of
spots
that
seemed
certain
death
for
him
and
by
instinct
or
cunning
he
has
avoided
or
escaped
every
trap
set
for
him
every
beast
and
for
every
man
there
is
a
trap
he
will
not
escape
quoth
ghaznavi
we
have
parleyed
with
the
for
the
ransom
of
captives
i
have
observed
this
man
conan
he
has
a
keen
relish
for
women
and
strong
drink
have
your
captive
octavia
fetched
here
jehungir
clapped
his
hands
and
an
impassive
kushite
eunuch
an
image
of
shining
ebony
in
silken
pantaloons
bowed
before
him
and
went
to
do
his
bidding
presently
he
returned
leading
by
the
wrist
a
tall
handsome
girl
whose
yellow
hair
clear
eyes
and
fair
skin
identified
her
as
a
member
of
her
race
her
scanty
silk
tunic
girded
at
the
waist
displayed
the
marvelous
contours
of
her
magnificent
figure
her
fine
eyes
flashed
with
resentment
and
her
red
lips
were
sulky
but
submission
had
been
taught
her
during
her
captivity
she
stood
with
hanging
head
before
her
master
until
he
motioned
her
to
a
seat
on
the
divan
beside
him
then
he
looked
inquiringly
at
ghaznavi
must
lure
conan
away
from
the
said
the
counsellor
abruptly
war
camp
is
at
present
pitched
somewhere
on
the
lower
reaches
of
the
zaporoska
river
which
as
you
well
know
is
a
wilderness
of
reeds
a
swampy
jungle
in
which
our
last
expedition
was
cut
to
pieces
by
those
masterless
devils
am
not
likely
to
forget
that
said
jehungir
wryly
is
an
uninhabited
island
near
the
mainland
said
ghaznavi
as
xapur
the
fortified
because
of
some
ancient
ruins
upon
it
there
is
a
peculiarity
about
it
which
makes
it
perfect
for
our
purpose
it
has
no
but
rises
sheer
out
of
the
sea
in
cliffs
a
hundred
and
fifty
feet
tall
not
even
an
ape
could
negotiate
them
the
only
place
where
a
man
can
go
up
or
down
is
a
narrow
path
on
the
western
side
that
has
the
appearance
of
a
worn
stair
carved
into
the
solid
rock
of
the
cliffs
we
could
trap
conan
on
that
island
alone
we
could
hunt
him
down
at
our
leisure
with
bows
as
men
hunt
a
lion
well
wish
for
the
moon
said
jehungir
impatiently
we
send
him
a
messenger
bidding
him
climb
the
cliffs
and
await
our
coming
effect
yes
seeing
jehungir
look
of
amazement
ghaznavi
continued
will
ask
for
a
parley
with
the
in
regard
to
prisoners
at
the
edge
of
the
steppes
by
fort
ghori
as
usual
we
will
go
with
a
force
and
encamp
outside
the
castle
they
will
come
with
an
equal
force
and
the
parley
will
go
forward
with
the
usual
distrust
and
suspicion
but
this
time
we
will
take
with
us
as
if
by
casual
chance
your
beautiful
captive
octavia
changed
color
and
listened
with
intensified
interest
as
the
counsellor
nodded
toward
her
will
use
all
her
wiles
to
attract
conan
attention
that
should
not
be
difficult
to
that
wild
reaver
she
should
appear
a
dazzling
vision
of
loveliness
her
vitality
and
substantial
figure
should
appeal
to
him
more
vividly
than
would
one
of
the
beauties
of
your
seraglio
octavia
sprang
up
her
white
fists
clenched
her
eyes
blazing
and
her
figure
quivering
with
outraged
anger
would
force
me
to
play
the
trollop
with
this
barbarian
she
exclaimed
will
not
i
am
no
slut
to
smirk
and
ogle
at
a
i
am
the
daughter
of
a
nemedian
lord
were
of
the
nemedian
nobility
before
my
riders
carried
you
off
returned
jehungir
cynically
you
are
merely
a
slave
who
will
do
as
she
is
bid
will
not
she
raged
the
contrary
rejoined
jehungir
with
studied
cruelty
will
i
like
ghaznavi
plan
continue
prince
among
counsellors
will
probably
wish
to
buy
her
you
will
refuse
to
sell
her
of
course
or
to
exchange
her
for
hyrkanian
prisoners
he
may
then
try
to
steal
her
or
take
her
by
force
though
i
do
not
think
even
he
would
break
the
anyway
we
must
be
prepared
for
whatever
he
might
attempt
shortly
after
the
parley
before
he
has
time
to
forget
all
about
her
we
will
send
a
messenger
to
him
under
a
flag
of
truce
accusing
him
of
stealing
the
girl
and
demanding
her
return
he
may
kill
the
messenger
but
at
least
he
will
think
that
she
has
escaped
we
will
send
a
spy
a
yuetshi
fisherman
will
do
to
the
camp
who
will
tell
conan
that
octavia
is
hiding
on
xapur
if
i
know
my
man
he
will
go
straight
to
that
place
we
do
not
know
that
he
will
go
alone
jehungir
argued
a
man
take
a
band
of
warriors
with
him
when
going
to
a
rendezvous
with
a
woman
he
desires
retorted
ghaznavi
chances
are
all
that
he
go
alone
but
we
will
take
care
of
the
other
alternative
we
will
not
await
him
on
the
island
where
we
might
be
trapped
ourselves
but
among
the
reeds
of
a
marshy
point
which
juts
out
to
within
a
thousand
yards
of
xapur
if
he
brings
a
large
force
we
beat
a
retreat
and
think
up
another
plot
if
he
comes
alone
or
with
a
small
party
we
will
have
him
depend
upon
it
he
will
come
remembering
your
charming
slave
smiles
and
meaning
glances
will
never
descend
to
such
shame
octavia
was
wild
with
fury
and
humiliation
will
die
first
will
not
die
my
rebellious
beauty
said
jehungir
you
will
be
subjected
to
a
very
painful
and
humiliating
experience
he
clapped
his
hands
and
octavia
paled
this
time
it
was
not
the
kushite
who
entered
but
a
shemite
a
heavily
muscled
man
of
medium
height
with
a
short
curled
beard
is
work
for
you
gilzan
said
jehungir
this
fool
and
play
with
her
awhile
yet
be
careful
not
to
spoil
her
beauty
with
an
inarticulate
grunt
the
shemite
seized
octavia
wrist
and
at
the
grasp
of
his
iron
fingers
all
the
defiance
went
out
of
her
with
a
piteous
cry
she
tore
away
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
her
implacable
master
sobbing
incoherently
for
mercy
jehungir
dismissed
the
disappointed
torturer
with
a
gesture
and
said
to
ghaznavi
your
plan
succeeds
i
will
fill
your
lap
with
gold
in
the
darkness
before
dawn
an
unaccustomed
sound
disturbed
the
solitude
that
slumbered
over
the
reedy
marshes
and
the
misty
waters
of
the
coast
it
was
not
a
drowsy
nor
a
waking
beast
it
was
a
human
who
struggled
through
the
thick
reeds
which
were
taller
than
a
man
head
it
was
a
woman
had
there
been
anyone
to
see
tall
and
her
splendid
limbs
molded
by
her
draggled
tunic
octavia
had
escaped
in
good
earnest
every
outraged
fiber
of
her
still
tingling
from
her
experience
in
a
captivity
that
had
become
unendurable
jehungir
mastery
of
her
had
been
bad
enough
but
with
deliberate
fiendishness
jehungir
had
given
her
to
a
nobleman
whose
name
was
a
byword
for
degeneracy
even
in
khawarizm
octavia
resilient
flesh
crawled
and
quivered
at
her
memories
desperation
had
nerved
her
climb
from
jelal
khan
castle
on
a
rope
made
of
strips
from
torn
tapestries
and
chance
had
led
her
to
a
picketed
horse
she
had
ridden
all
night
and
dawn
found
her
with
a
foundered
steed
on
the
swampy
shores
of
the
sea
quivering
with
the
abhorrence
of
being
dragged
back
to
the
revolting
destiny
planned
for
her
by
jelal
khan
she
plunged
into
the
morass
seeking
a
from
the
pursuit
she
expected
when
the
reeds
grew
thinner
around
her
and
the
water
rose
about
her
thighs
she
saw
the
dim
loom
of
an
island
ahead
of
her
a
broad
span
of
water
lay
between
but
she
did
not
hesitate
she
waded
out
until
the
low
waves
were
lapping
about
her
waist
then
she
struck
out
strongly
swimming
with
a
vigor
that
promised
unusual
endurance
as
she
neared
the
island
she
saw
that
it
rose
sheer
from
the
water
in
cliffs
she
reached
them
at
last
but
found
neither
ledge
to
stand
on
below
the
water
not
to
cling
to
above
she
swam
on
following
the
curve
of
the
cliffs
the
strain
of
her
long
flight
beginning
to
weight
her
limbs
her
hands
fluttered
along
the
sheer
stone
and
suddenly
they
found
a
depression
with
a
sobbing
gasp
of
relief
she
pulled
herself
out
of
the
water
and
clung
there
a
dripping
white
goddess
in
the
dim
starlight
she
had
come
upon
what
seemed
to
be
steps
carved
in
the
cliff
up
them
she
went
flattening
herself
against
the
stone
as
she
caught
the
faint
clack
of
muffled
oars
she
strained
her
eyes
and
thought
she
made
out
a
vague
bulk
moving
toward
the
reedy
point
she
had
just
quitted
but
it
was
too
far
away
for
her
to
be
sure
in
the
darkness
and
presently
the
faint
sound
ceased
and
she
continued
her
climb
if
it
were
her
pursuers
she
knew
of
no
better
course
than
to
hide
on
the
island
she
knew
that
most
of
the
islands
off
that
marshy
coast
were
uninhabited
this
might
be
a
pirate
lair
but
even
pirates
would
be
preferable
to
the
beast
she
had
escaped
a
vagrant
thought
crossed
her
mind
as
she
climbed
in
which
she
mentally
compared
her
former
master
with
the
chief
with
whom
by
compulsion
she
had
shamelessly
flirted
in
the
pavilions
of
the
camp
by
fort
ghori
where
the
hyrkanian
lords
had
parleyed
with
the
warriors
of
the
steppes
his
burning
gaze
had
frightened
and
humiliated
her
but
his
cleanly
elemental
fierceness
set
him
above
jelal
khan
a
monster
such
as
only
an
overly
opulent
civilization
can
produce
she
scrambled
up
over
the
cliff
edge
and
looked
timidly
at
the
dense
shadows
which
confronted
her
the
trees
grew
close
to
the
cliffs
presenting
a
solid
mass
of
blackness
something
whirred
above
her
head
and
she
cowered
even
though
realizing
it
was
only
a
bat
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
those
ebony
shadows
but
she
set
her
teeth
and
went
toward
them
trying
not
to
think
of
snakes
her
bare
feet
made
no
sound
in
the
spongy
loam
under
the
trees
once
among
them
the
darkness
closed
frighteningly
about
her
she
had
not
taken
a
dozen
steps
when
she
was
no
longer
able
to
look
back
and
see
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
beyond
a
few
steps
more
and
she
became
hopelessly
confused
and
lost
her
sense
of
direction
through
the
tangled
branches
not
even
a
star
peered
she
groped
and
floundered
on
blindly
and
then
came
to
a
sudden
halt
somewhere
ahead
there
began
the
rhythmical
booming
of
a
drum
it
was
not
such
a
sound
as
she
would
have
expected
to
hear
in
that
time
and
place
then
she
forgot
it
as
she
was
aware
of
a
presence
near
her
she
could
not
see
but
she
knew
that
something
was
standing
beside
her
in
the
darkness
with
a
stifled
cry
she
shrank
back
and
as
she
did
so
something
that
even
in
her
panic
she
recognized
as
a
human
arm
curved
about
her
waist
she
screamed
and
threw
all
her
supple
young
strength
into
a
wild
lunge
for
freedom
but
her
captor
caught
her
up
like
a
child
crushing
her
frantic
resistance
with
ease
the
silence
with
which
her
frenzied
pleas
and
protests
were
received
added
to
her
terror
as
she
felt
herself
being
carried
through
the
darkness
toward
the
distant
drum
which
still
pulsed
and
muttered
as
the
first
tinge
of
dawn
reddened
the
sea
a
small
boat
with
a
solitary
occupant
approached
the
cliffs
the
man
in
the
boat
was
a
picturesque
figure
a
crimson
scarf
was
knotted
about
his
head
his
wide
silk
breeches
of
flaming
hue
were
upheld
by
a
broad
sash
which
likewise
supported
a
scimitar
in
a
shagreen
scabbard
his
leather
boots
suggested
the
horseman
rather
than
the
seaman
but
he
handled
his
boat
with
skill
through
his
widely
open
white
silk
shirt
showed
his
broad
muscular
breast
burned
brown
by
the
sun
the
muscles
of
his
heavy
bronzed
arms
rippled
as
he
pulled
the
oars
with
an
almost
feline
ease
of
motion
a
fierce
vitality
that
was
evident
in
each
feature
and
motion
set
him
apart
from
common
men
yet
his
expression
was
neither
savage
nor
somber
though
the
smoldering
blue
eyes
hinted
at
ferocity
easily
wakened
this
was
conan
who
had
wandered
into
the
armed
camps
of
the
with
no
other
possession
than
his
wits
and
his
sword
and
who
had
carved
his
way
to
leadership
among
them
he
paddled
to
the
carven
stair
as
one
familiar
with
his
environs
and
moored
the
boat
to
a
projection
of
the
rock
then
he
went
up
the
worn
steps
without
hesitation
he
was
keenly
alert
not
because
he
consciously
suspected
hidden
danger
but
because
alertness
was
a
part
of
him
whetted
by
the
wild
existence
he
followed
what
ghaznavi
had
considered
animal
intuition
or
some
sixth
sense
was
merely
the
faculties
and
savage
wit
of
the
barbarian
conan
had
no
instinct
to
tell
him
that
men
were
watching
him
from
a
covert
among
the
reeds
of
the
mainland
as
he
climbed
the
cliff
one
of
these
men
breathed
deeply
and
stealthily
lifted
a
bow
jehungir
caught
his
wrist
and
hissed
an
oath
into
his
ear
will
you
betray
us
do
you
realize
he
is
out
of
range
let
him
get
upon
the
island
he
will
go
looking
for
the
girl
we
will
stay
here
awhile
he
have
sensed
our
presence
or
guessed
our
plot
he
may
have
warriors
hidden
somewhere
we
will
wait
in
an
hour
if
nothing
suspicious
occurs
we
row
up
to
the
foot
of
the
stair
and
await
him
there
if
he
does
not
return
in
a
reasonable
time
some
of
us
will
go
upon
the
island
and
hunt
him
down
but
i
do
not
wish
to
do
that
if
it
can
be
helped
some
of
us
are
sure
to
die
if
we
have
to
go
into
the
bush
after
him
i
had
rather
catch
him
descending
the
stair
where
we
can
feather
him
with
arrows
from
a
safe
distance
meanwhile
the
unsuspecting
had
plunged
into
the
forest
he
went
silently
in
his
soft
leather
boots
his
gaze
sifting
every
shadow
in
eagerness
to
catch
sight
of
the
splendid
beauty
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
ever
since
he
had
seen
her
in
the
pavilion
of
jehungir
agha
by
fort
ghori
he
would
have
desired
her
even
if
she
had
displayed
repugnance
toward
him
but
her
cryptic
smiles
and
glances
had
fired
his
blood
and
with
all
the
lawless
violence
which
was
his
heritage
he
desired
that
woman
of
civilization
he
had
been
on
xapur
before
less
than
a
month
ago
he
had
held
a
secret
conclave
here
with
a
pirate
crew
he
knew
that
he
was
approaching
a
point
where
he
could
see
the
mysterious
ruins
which
gave
the
island
its
name
and
he
wondered
if
he
would
find
the
girl
hiding
among
them
even
with
the
thought
he
stopped
as
though
struck
dead
ahead
of
him
among
the
trees
rose
something
that
his
reason
told
him
was
not
possible
was
a
great
dark
green
wall
with
towers
rearing
beyond
the
conan
stood
paralyzed
in
the
disruption
of
the
faculties
which
demoralizes
anyone
who
is
confronted
by
an
impossible
negation
of
sanity
he
doubted
neither
his
sight
nor
his
reason
but
something
was
monstrously
out
of
joint
less
than
a
month
ago
only
broken
ruins
had
showed
among
the
trees
what
human
hands
could
rear
such
a
mammoth
pile
as
now
met
his
eyes
in
the
few
weeks
which
had
elapsed
besides
the
buccaneers
who
roamed
vilayet
ceaselessly
would
have
learned
of
any
work
going
on
on
such
a
stupendous
scale
and
would
have
informed
the
there
was
no
explaining
this
thing
but
it
was
so
he
was
on
xapur
and
that
fantastic
heap
of
towering
masonry
was
on
xapur
and
all
was
madness
and
paradox
yet
it
was
all
true
he
wheeled
back
through
the
jungle
down
the
carven
stair
and
across
the
blue
waters
to
the
distant
camp
at
the
mouth
of
the
zaporoska
in
that
moment
of
unreasoning
panic
even
the
thought
of
halting
so
near
the
inland
sea
was
repugnant
he
would
leave
it
behind
him
would
quit
the
armed
camps
and
the
steppes
and
put
a
thousand
miles
between
him
and
the
blue
mysterious
east
where
the
most
basic
laws
of
nature
could
be
set
at
naught
by
what
diabolism
he
could
not
guess
for
an
instant
the
future
fate
of
kingdoms
that
hinged
on
this
barbarian
hung
in
the
balance
it
was
a
small
thing
that
tipped
the
scales
merely
a
shred
of
silk
hanging
on
a
bush
that
caught
his
uneasy
glance
he
leaned
to
it
his
nostrils
expanding
his
nerves
quivering
to
a
subtle
stimulant
on
that
bit
of
torn
cloth
so
faint
that
it
was
less
with
his
physical
faculties
than
by
some
obscure
instinctive
sense
that
he
recognized
it
lingered
the
tantalizing
perfume
that
he
connected
with
the
sweet
firm
flesh
of
the
woman
he
had
seen
in
pavilion
the
fisherman
had
not
lied
then
she
here
then
in
the
soil
he
saw
a
single
track
of
a
bare
foot
long
and
slender
but
a
not
a
woman
and
sunk
deeper
than
was
natural
the
conclusion
was
obvious
the
man
who
made
that
track
was
carrying
a
burden
and
what
should
it
be
but
the
girl
the
was
seeking
he
stood
silently
facing
the
dark
towers
that
loomed
through
the
trees
his
eyes
slits
of
blue
desire
for
the
woman
vied
with
a
sullen
primordial
rage
at
whoever
had
taken
her
his
human
passion
fought
down
his
fears
and
dropping
into
the
stalking
crouch
of
a
hunting
panther
he
glided
toward
the
walls
taking
advantage
of
the
dense
foliage
to
escape
detection
from
the
battlements
as
he
approached
he
saw
that
the
walls
were
composed
of
the
same
green
stone
that
had
formed
the
ruins
and
he
was
haunted
by
a
vague
sense
of
familiarity
it
was
as
if
he
looked
upon
something
he
had
never
seen
before
but
had
dreamed
of
or
pictured
mentally
at
last
he
recognized
the
sensation
the
walls
and
towers
followed
the
plan
of
the
ruins
it
was
as
if
the
crumbling
lines
had
grown
back
into
the
structures
they
originally
were
no
sound
disturbed
the
morning
quiet
as
conan
stole
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
which
rose
sheer
from
the
luxuriant
growth
on
the
southern
reaches
of
the
inland
sea
the
vegetation
was
almost
tropical
he
saw
no
one
on
the
battlements
heard
no
sounds
within
he
saw
a
massive
gate
a
short
distance
to
his
left
and
had
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
not
locked
and
guarded
but
he
believed
that
the
woman
he
sought
was
somewhere
beyond
that
wall
and
the
course
he
took
was
characteristically
reckless
above
him
branches
reached
out
toward
the
battlements
he
went
up
a
great
tree
like
a
cat
and
reaching
a
point
above
the
parapet
he
gripped
a
thick
limb
with
both
hands
swung
back
and
forth
at
length
until
he
had
gained
momentum
and
then
let
go
and
catapulted
through
the
air
landing
on
the
battlements
crouching
there
he
stared
down
into
the
streets
of
a
city
the
circumference
of
the
wall
was
not
great
but
the
number
of
green
stone
buildings
it
contained
was
surprizing
they
were
three
or
four
stories
in
height
mainly
reflecting
a
fine
architectural
style
the
streets
converged
like
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
into
an
court
in
the
center
of
the
town
which
gave
upon
a
lofty
edifice
which
with
its
domes
and
towers
dominated
the
whole
city
he
saw
no
one
moving
in
the
streets
or
looking
out
of
the
windows
though
the
sun
was
already
coming
up
the
silence
that
reigned
there
might
have
been
that
of
a
dead
and
deserted
city
a
narrow
stone
stair
ascended
the
wall
near
him
down
this
he
went
houses
shouldered
so
closely
to
the
wall
that
down
the
stair
he
found
himself
within
arm
length
of
a
window
and
halted
to
peer
in
there
were
no
bars
and
the
silk
curtains
were
caught
back
with
satin
cords
he
looked
into
a
chamber
whose
walls
were
hidden
by
dark
velvet
tapestries
the
floor
was
covered
with
thick
rugs
and
there
were
benches
of
polished
ebony
and
an
ivory
dais
heaped
with
furs
he
was
about
to
continue
his
descent
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
someone
approaching
in
the
street
below
before
the
unknown
person
could
come
round
a
corner
and
see
him
on
the
stair
he
stepped
quickly
across
the
intervening
space
and
dropped
lightly
into
the
room
drawing
his
scimitar
he
stood
for
an
instant
then
as
nothing
happened
he
was
moving
across
the
rugs
toward
an
arched
doorway
when
a
hanging
was
drawn
aside
revealing
a
cushioned
alcove
from
which
a
slender
girl
regarded
him
with
languid
eyes
conan
glared
at
her
tensely
expecting
her
momentarily
to
start
screaming
but
she
merely
smothered
a
yawn
with
a
dainty
hand
rose
from
the
alcove
and
leaned
negligently
against
the
hanging
which
she
held
with
one
hand
she
was
undoubtedly
a
member
of
a
white
race
though
her
skin
was
very
dark
her
hair
was
black
as
midnight
her
only
garment
a
wisp
of
silk
about
her
supple
hips
presently
she
spoke
but
the
tongue
was
unfamiliar
to
him
and
he
shook
his
head
she
yawned
again
stretched
lithely
and
without
any
show
of
fear
or
surprize
shifted
to
a
language
he
did
understand
a
dialect
of
yuetshi
which
sounded
strangely
archaic
you
looking
for
someone
she
asked
as
indifferently
as
if
the
invasion
of
her
chamber
by
an
armed
stranger
were
the
most
common
thing
imaginable
are
you
he
demanded
am
yateli
she
answered
languidly
must
have
feasted
late
last
night
i
am
so
sleepy
now
who
are
you
am
conan
a
among
the
he
answered
watching
her
narrowly
he
believed
her
attitude
to
be
a
pose
and
expected
her
to
try
to
escape
from
the
chamber
or
rouse
the
house
but
though
a
velvet
rope
that
might
be
a
signal
cord
hung
near
her
she
did
not
reach
for
it
she
repeated
drowsily
are
not
a
dagonian
i
suppose
you
are
a
mercenary
have
you
cut
the
heads
off
many
yuetshi
do
not
war
on
water
rats
he
snorted
they
are
very
terrible
she
murmured
remember
when
they
were
our
slaves
but
they
revolted
and
burned
and
slew
only
the
magic
of
khosatral
khel
has
kept
them
from
the
walls
she
paused
a
puzzled
look
struggling
with
the
sleepiness
of
her
expression
forgot
she
muttered
climb
the
walls
last
night
there
was
shouting
and
fire
and
people
calling
in
vain
on
khosatral
she
shook
her
head
as
if
to
clear
it
that
can
not
be
she
murmured
i
am
alive
and
i
thought
i
was
dead
oh
to
the
devil
with
it
she
came
across
the
chamber
and
taking
conan
hand
drew
him
to
the
dais
he
yielded
in
bewilderment
and
uncertainty
the
girl
smiled
at
him
like
a
sleepy
child
her
long
silky
lashes
drooped
over
dusky
clouded
eyes
she
ran
her
fingers
through
his
thick
black
locks
as
if
to
assure
herself
of
his
reality
was
a
dream
she
yawned
it
all
a
dream
i
feel
like
a
dream
now
i
do
care
i
ca
remember
something
i
have
forgotten
there
is
something
i
can
not
understand
but
i
grow
so
sleepy
when
i
try
to
think
anyway
it
does
matter
do
you
mean
he
asked
uneasily
said
they
climbed
the
walls
last
night
who
yuetshi
i
thought
so
anyway
a
cloud
of
smoke
hid
everything
but
a
naked
devil
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
drove
his
knife
into
my
breast
oh
it
hurt
but
it
was
a
dream
because
see
there
is
no
scar
she
idly
inspected
her
smooth
bosom
and
then
sank
upon
conan
lap
and
passed
her
supple
arms
around
his
massive
neck
can
not
remember
she
murmured
nestling
her
dark
head
against
his
mighty
breast
is
dim
and
misty
it
does
not
matter
you
are
no
dream
you
are
strong
let
us
live
while
we
can
love
me
he
cradled
the
girl
glossy
head
in
the
bend
of
his
heavy
arm
and
kissed
her
full
red
lips
with
unfeigned
relish
are
strong
she
repeated
her
voice
waning
me
love
the
sleepy
murmur
faded
away
the
dusky
eyes
closed
the
long
lashes
drooping
over
the
sensuous
cheeks
the
supple
body
relaxed
in
arms
he
scowled
down
at
her
she
seemed
to
partake
of
the
illusion
that
haunted
this
whole
city
but
the
firm
resilience
of
her
limbs
under
his
questing
fingers
convinced
him
that
he
had
a
living
human
girl
in
his
arms
and
not
the
shadow
of
a
dream
no
less
disturbed
he
hastily
laid
her
on
the
furs
upon
the
dais
her
sleep
was
too
deep
to
be
natural
he
decided
that
she
must
be
an
addict
of
some
drug
perhaps
like
the
black
lotus
of
xuthal
then
he
found
something
else
to
make
him
wonder
among
the
furs
on
the
dais
was
a
gorgeous
spotted
skin
whose
predominant
hue
was
golden
it
was
not
a
clever
copy
but
the
skin
of
an
actual
beast
and
that
beast
conan
knew
had
been
extinct
for
at
least
a
thousand
years
it
was
the
great
golden
leopard
which
figures
so
predominantly
in
hyborian
legendry
and
which
the
ancient
artists
delighted
to
portray
in
pigments
and
marble
shaking
his
head
in
bewilderment
conan
passed
through
the
archway
into
a
winding
corridor
silence
hung
over
the
house
but
outside
he
heard
a
sound
which
his
keen
ears
recognized
as
something
ascending
the
stair
on
the
wall
from
which
he
had
entered
the
building
an
instant
later
he
was
startled
to
hear
something
land
with
a
soft
but
weighty
thud
on
the
floor
of
the
chamber
he
had
just
quitted
turning
quickly
away
he
hurried
along
the
twisting
hallway
until
something
on
the
floor
before
him
brought
him
to
a
halt
it
was
a
human
figure
which
lay
half
in
the
hall
and
half
in
an
opening
that
obviously
was
normally
concealed
by
a
door
which
was
a
duplicate
of
the
panels
of
the
wall
it
was
a
man
dark
and
lean
clad
only
in
a
silk
with
a
shaven
head
and
cruel
features
and
he
lay
as
if
death
had
struck
him
just
as
he
was
emerging
from
the
panel
conan
bent
above
him
seeking
the
cause
of
his
death
and
discovered
him
to
be
merely
sunk
in
the
same
deep
sleep
as
the
girl
in
the
chamber
but
why
should
he
select
such
a
place
for
his
slumbers
while
meditating
on
the
matter
conan
was
galvanized
by
a
sound
behind
him
something
was
moving
up
the
corridor
in
his
direction
a
quick
glance
down
it
showed
that
it
ended
in
a
great
door
which
might
be
locked
conan
jerked
the
supine
body
out
of
the
and
stepped
through
pulling
the
panel
shut
after
him
a
click
told
him
it
was
locked
in
place
standing
in
utter
darkness
he
heard
a
shuffling
tread
halt
just
outside
the
door
and
a
faint
chill
trickled
along
his
spine
that
was
no
human
step
nor
that
of
any
beast
he
had
ever
encountered
there
was
an
instant
of
silence
then
a
faint
creak
of
wood
and
metal
putting
out
his
hand
he
felt
the
door
straining
and
bending
inward
as
if
a
great
weight
were
being
steadily
borne
against
it
from
the
outside
as
he
reached
for
his
sword
this
ceased
and
he
heard
a
strange
slobbering
mouthing
that
prickled
the
short
hairs
on
his
scalp
scimitar
in
hand
he
began
backing
away
and
his
heels
felt
steps
down
which
he
nearly
tumbled
he
was
in
a
narrow
staircase
leading
downward
he
groped
his
way
down
in
the
blackness
feeling
for
but
not
finding
some
other
opening
in
the
walls
just
as
he
decided
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
house
but
deep
in
the
earth
under
it
the
steps
ceased
in
a
level
tunnel
along
the
black
silent
tunnel
conan
groped
momentarily
dreading
a
fall
into
some
unseen
pit
but
at
last
his
feet
struck
steps
again
and
he
went
up
them
until
he
came
to
a
door
on
which
his
fumbling
fingers
found
a
metal
catch
he
came
out
into
a
dim
and
lofty
room
of
enormous
proportions
fantastic
columns
marched
around
the
mottled
walls
upholding
a
ceiling
which
at
once
translucent
and
dusky
seemed
like
a
cloudy
midnight
sky
giving
an
illusion
of
impossible
height
if
any
light
filtered
in
from
the
outside
it
was
curiously
altered
in
a
brooding
twilight
conan
moved
across
the
bare
green
floor
the
great
room
was
circular
pierced
on
one
side
by
the
great
bronze
valves
of
a
giant
door
opposite
this
on
a
dais
against
the
wall
up
to
which
led
broad
curving
steps
there
stood
a
throne
of
copper
and
when
conan
saw
what
was
coiled
on
this
throne
he
retreated
hastily
lifting
his
scimitar
then
as
the
thing
did
not
move
he
scanned
it
more
closely
and
presently
mounted
the
glass
steps
and
stared
down
at
it
it
was
a
gigantic
snake
apparently
carved
in
some
substance
each
scale
stood
out
as
distinctly
as
in
real
life
and
the
iridescent
colors
were
vividly
reproduced
the
great
head
was
half
submerged
in
the
folds
of
its
trunk
so
neither
the
eyes
nor
jaws
were
visible
recognition
stirred
in
his
mind
this
snake
was
evidently
meant
to
represent
one
of
those
grim
monsters
of
the
marsh
which
in
past
ages
had
haunted
the
reedy
edges
of
vilayet
southern
shores
but
like
the
golden
leopard
they
had
been
extinct
for
hundreds
of
years
conan
had
seen
rude
images
of
them
in
miniature
among
the
of
the
yuetshi
and
there
was
a
description
of
them
in
the
of
which
drew
on
prehistoric
sources
conan
admired
the
scaly
torso
thick
as
his
thigh
and
obviously
of
great
length
and
he
reached
out
and
laid
a
curious
hand
on
the
thing
and
as
he
did
so
his
heart
nearly
stopped
an
icy
chill
congealed
the
blood
in
his
veins
and
lifted
the
short
hair
on
his
scalp
under
his
hand
there
was
not
the
smooth
brittle
surface
of
glass
or
metal
or
stone
but
the
yielding
fibrous
mass
of
a
thing
he
felt
cold
sluggish
life
flowing
under
his
fingers
his
hand
jerked
back
in
instinctive
repulsion
sword
shaking
in
his
grasp
horror
and
revulsion
and
fear
almost
choking
him
he
backed
away
and
down
the
glass
steps
with
painful
care
glaring
in
awful
fascination
at
the
grisly
thing
that
slumbered
on
the
copper
throne
it
did
not
move
he
reached
the
bronze
door
and
tried
it
with
his
heart
in
his
teeth
sweating
with
fear
that
he
should
find
himself
locked
in
with
that
slimy
horror
but
the
valves
yielded
to
his
touch
and
he
glided
through
and
closed
them
behind
him
he
found
himself
in
a
wide
hallway
with
lofty
tapestried
walls
where
the
light
was
the
same
twilight
gloom
it
made
distant
objects
indistinct
and
that
made
him
uneasy
rousing
thoughts
of
serpents
gliding
unseen
through
the
dimness
a
door
at
the
other
end
seemed
miles
away
in
the
illusive
light
nearer
at
hand
the
tapestry
hung
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
an
opening
behind
it
and
lifting
it
cautiously
he
discovered
a
narrow
stair
leading
up
while
he
hesitated
he
heard
in
the
great
room
he
had
just
left
the
same
shuffling
tread
he
had
heard
outside
the
locked
panel
had
he
been
followed
through
the
tunnel
he
went
up
the
stair
hastily
dropping
the
tapestry
in
place
behind
him
emerging
presently
into
a
twisting
corridor
he
took
the
first
doorway
he
came
to
he
had
a
twofold
purpose
in
his
apparently
aimless
prowling
to
escape
from
the
building
and
its
mysteries
and
to
find
the
nemedian
girl
who
he
felt
was
imprisoned
somewhere
in
this
palace
temple
or
whatever
it
was
he
believed
it
was
the
great
domed
edifice
in
the
center
of
the
city
and
it
was
likely
that
here
dwelt
the
ruler
of
the
town
to
whom
a
captive
woman
would
doubtless
be
brought
he
found
himself
in
a
chamber
not
another
corridor
and
was
about
to
retrace
his
steps
when
he
heard
a
voice
which
came
from
behind
one
of
the
walls
there
was
no
door
in
that
wall
but
he
leaned
close
and
heard
distinctly
and
an
icy
chill
crawled
slowly
along
his
spine
the
tongue
was
nemedian
but
the
voice
was
not
human
there
was
a
terrifying
resonance
about
it
like
a
bell
tolling
at
midnight
was
no
life
in
the
abyss
save
that
which
was
incorporated
in
me
it
tolled
was
there
light
nor
motion
nor
any
sound
only
the
urge
behind
and
beyond
life
guided
and
impelled
me
on
my
upward
journey
blind
insensate
inexorable
through
ages
upon
ages
and
the
changeless
strata
of
darkness
i
climbed
ensorcelled
by
that
belling
resonance
conan
crouched
forgetful
of
all
else
until
its
hypnotic
power
caused
a
strange
replacement
of
faculties
and
perception
and
sound
created
the
illusion
of
sight
conan
was
no
longer
aware
of
the
voice
save
as
rhythmical
waves
of
sound
transported
beyond
his
age
and
his
own
individuality
he
was
seeing
the
transmutation
of
the
being
men
called
khosatral
khel
which
crawled
up
from
night
and
the
abyss
ages
ago
to
clothe
itself
in
the
substance
of
the
material
universe
but
human
flesh
was
too
frail
too
paltry
to
hold
the
terrific
essence
that
was
khosatral
khel
so
he
stood
up
in
the
shape
and
aspect
of
a
man
but
his
flesh
was
not
flesh
nor
the
bone
bone
nor
blood
blood
he
became
a
blasphemy
against
all
nature
for
he
caused
to
live
and
think
and
act
a
basic
substance
that
before
had
never
known
the
pulse
and
stir
of
animate
being
he
stalked
through
the
world
like
a
god
for
no
earthly
weapon
could
harm
him
and
to
him
a
century
was
like
an
hour
in
his
wanderings
he
came
upon
a
primitive
people
inhabiting
the
island
of
dagonia
and
it
pleased
him
to
give
this
race
culture
and
civilization
and
by
his
aid
they
built
the
city
of
dagon
and
they
abode
there
and
worshipped
him
strange
and
grisly
were
his
servants
called
from
the
dark
corners
of
the
planet
where
grim
survivals
of
forgotten
ages
yet
lurked
his
house
in
dagon
was
connected
with
every
other
house
by
tunnels
through
which
his
priests
bore
victims
for
the
sacrifice
but
after
many
ages
a
fierce
and
brutish
people
appeared
on
the
shores
of
the
sea
they
called
themselves
yuetshi
and
after
a
fierce
battle
they
were
defeated
and
enslaved
and
for
nearly
a
generation
they
died
on
the
altars
of
khosatral
his
sorcery
kept
them
in
bonds
then
their
priest
a
strange
gaunt
man
of
unknown
race
plunged
into
the
wilderness
and
when
he
returned
he
bore
a
knife
that
was
of
no
earthly
substance
it
was
forged
of
a
meteor
which
flashed
through
the
sky
like
a
flaming
arrow
and
fell
in
a
far
valley
the
slaves
rose
their
crescents
cut
down
the
men
of
dagon
like
sheep
and
against
that
unearthly
knife
the
magic
of
khosatral
was
impotent
while
carnage
and
slaughter
bellowed
through
the
red
smoke
that
choked
the
streets
the
grimmest
act
of
that
grim
drama
was
played
in
the
cryptic
dome
behind
the
great
daised
chamber
with
its
copper
throne
and
its
walls
mottled
like
the
skin
of
serpents
from
that
dome
the
yuetshi
priest
emerged
alone
he
had
not
slain
his
foe
because
he
wished
to
hold
the
threat
of
his
losing
over
the
heads
of
his
own
rebellious
subjects
he
had
left
khosatral
lying
upon
the
golden
dais
with
the
mystic
knife
across
his
breast
for
a
spell
to
hold
him
senseless
and
inanimate
until
doomsday
but
the
ages
passed
and
the
priest
died
the
towers
of
deserted
dagon
crumbled
the
tales
became
dim
and
the
yuetshi
were
reduced
by
plagues
and
famines
and
war
to
scattered
remnants
dwelling
in
squalor
along
the
seashore
only
the
cryptic
dome
resisted
the
rot
of
time
until
a
chance
thunderbolt
and
the
curiosity
of
a
fisherman
lifted
from
the
breast
of
the
god
the
magic
knife
and
broke
the
spell
khosatral
khel
rose
and
lived
and
waxed
mighty
once
more
it
pleased
him
to
restore
the
city
as
it
was
in
the
days
before
its
fall
by
his
necromancy
he
lifted
the
towers
from
the
dust
of
forgotten
millenniums
and
the
folk
which
had
been
dust
for
ages
moved
in
life
again
but
folk
who
have
tasted
death
are
only
partly
alive
in
the
dark
corners
of
their
souls
and
minds
death
still
lurks
unconquered
by
night
the
people
of
dagon
moved
and
loved
hated
and
feasted
and
remembered
the
fall
of
dagon
and
their
own
slaughter
only
as
a
dim
dream
they
moved
in
an
enchanted
mist
of
illusion
feeling
the
strangeness
of
their
existence
but
not
inquiring
the
reasons
therefor
with
the
coming
of
day
they
sank
into
deep
sleep
to
be
roused
again
only
by
the
coming
of
night
which
is
akin
to
death
all
this
rolled
in
a
terrible
panorama
before
conan
consciousness
as
he
crouched
beside
the
tapestried
wall
his
reason
staggered
all
certainty
and
sanity
were
swept
away
leaving
a
shadowy
universe
through
which
stole
hooded
figures
of
grisly
potentialities
through
the
belling
of
the
voice
which
was
like
a
tolling
of
triumph
over
the
ordered
laws
of
a
sane
planet
a
human
sound
anchored
conan
mind
from
its
flight
through
spheres
of
madness
it
was
the
hysterical
sobbing
of
a
woman
involuntarily
he
sprang
up
jehungir
agha
waited
with
growing
impatience
in
his
boat
among
the
reeds
more
than
an
hour
passed
and
conan
had
not
reappeared
doubtless
he
was
still
searching
the
island
for
the
girl
he
thought
to
be
hidden
there
but
another
surmise
occurred
to
the
agha
suppose
the
had
left
his
warriors
near
by
and
that
they
should
grow
suspicious
and
come
to
investigate
his
long
absence
jehungir
spoke
to
the
oarsmen
and
the
long
boat
slid
from
among
the
reeds
and
glided
toward
the
carven
stairs
leaving
half
a
dozen
men
in
the
boat
he
took
the
rest
ten
mighty
archers
of
khawarizm
in
spired
helmets
and
cloaks
like
hunters
invading
the
retreat
of
the
lion
they
stole
forward
under
the
trees
arrows
on
string
silence
reigned
over
the
forest
except
when
a
great
green
thing
that
might
have
been
a
parrot
swirled
over
their
heads
with
a
low
thunder
of
broad
wings
and
then
sped
off
through
the
trees
with
a
sudden
gesture
jehungir
halted
his
party
and
they
stared
incredulously
at
the
towers
that
showed
through
the
verdure
in
the
distance
muttered
jehungir
pirates
have
rebuilt
the
ruins
doubtless
conan
is
there
we
must
investigate
this
a
fortified
town
this
close
to
the
mainland
come
with
renewed
caution
they
glided
through
the
trees
the
game
had
altered
from
pursuers
and
hunters
they
had
become
spies
and
as
they
crept
through
the
tangled
growth
the
man
they
sought
was
in
peril
more
deadly
than
their
filigreed
arrows
conan
realized
with
a
crawling
of
his
skin
that
beyond
the
wall
the
belling
voice
had
ceased
he
stood
motionless
as
a
statue
his
gaze
fixed
on
a
curtained
door
through
which
he
knew
that
a
culminating
horror
would
presently
appear
it
was
dim
and
misty
in
the
chamber
and
conan
hair
began
to
lift
on
his
scalp
as
he
looked
he
saw
a
head
and
a
pair
of
gigantic
shoulders
grow
out
of
the
twilight
gloom
there
was
no
sound
of
footsteps
but
the
great
dusky
form
grew
more
distinct
until
conan
recognized
the
figure
of
a
man
he
was
clad
in
sandals
a
skirt
and
a
broad
shagreen
girdle
his
mane
was
confined
by
a
circlet
of
gold
conan
stared
at
the
sweep
of
the
monstrous
shoulders
the
breadth
of
the
swelling
breast
the
bands
and
ridges
and
clusters
of
muscles
on
torso
and
limbs
the
face
was
without
weakness
and
without
mercy
the
eyes
were
balls
of
dark
fire
and
conan
knew
that
this
was
khosatral
khel
the
ancient
from
the
abyss
the
god
of
dagonia
no
word
was
spoken
no
word
was
necessary
khosatral
spread
his
great
arms
and
conan
crouching
beneath
them
slashed
at
the
giant
belly
then
he
bounded
back
eyes
blazing
with
surprise
the
keen
edge
had
rung
on
the
mighty
body
as
on
an
anvil
rebounding
without
cutting
then
khosatral
came
upon
him
in
an
irresistible
surge
there
was
a
fleeting
concussion
a
fierce
writhing
and
intertwining
of
limbs
and
bodies
and
then
conan
sprang
clear
every
thew
quivering
from
the
violence
of
his
efforts
blood
started
where
the
grazing
fingers
had
torn
the
skin
in
that
instant
of
contact
he
had
experienced
the
ultimate
madness
of
blasphemed
nature
no
human
flesh
had
bruised
his
but
animated
and
sentient
it
was
a
body
of
living
iron
which
opposed
his
khosatral
loomed
above
the
warrior
in
the
gloom
once
let
those
great
fingers
lock
and
they
would
not
loosen
until
the
human
body
hung
limp
in
their
grasp
in
that
twilit
chamber
it
was
as
if
a
man
fought
with
a
in
a
nightmare
flinging
down
his
useless
sword
conan
caught
up
a
heavy
bench
and
hurled
it
with
all
his
power
it
was
such
a
missile
as
few
men
could
even
lift
on
khosatral
mighty
breast
it
smashed
into
shreds
and
splinters
it
did
not
even
shake
the
giant
on
his
braced
legs
his
face
lost
something
of
its
human
aspect
a
nimbus
of
fire
played
about
his
awesome
head
and
like
a
moving
tower
he
came
on
with
a
desperate
wrench
conan
ripped
a
whole
section
of
tapestry
from
the
wall
and
whirling
it
with
a
muscular
effort
greater
than
that
required
for
throwing
the
bench
he
flung
it
over
the
giant
head
for
an
instant
khosatral
floundered
smothered
and
blinded
by
the
clinging
stuff
that
resisted
his
strength
as
wood
or
steel
could
not
have
done
and
in
that
instant
conan
caught
up
his
scimitar
and
shot
out
into
the
corridor
without
checking
his
speed
he
hurled
himself
through
the
door
of
the
adjoining
chamber
slammed
the
door
and
shot
the
bolt
then
as
he
wheeled
he
stopped
short
all
the
blood
in
him
seeming
to
surge
to
his
head
crouching
on
a
heap
of
silk
cushions
golden
hair
streaming
over
her
naked
shoulders
eyes
blank
with
terror
was
the
woman
for
whom
he
had
dared
so
much
he
almost
forgot
the
horror
at
his
heels
until
a
splintering
crash
behind
him
brought
him
to
his
senses
he
caught
up
the
girl
and
sprang
for
the
opposite
door
she
was
too
helpless
with
fright
either
to
resist
or
to
aid
him
a
faint
whimper
was
the
only
sound
of
which
she
seemed
capable
conan
wasted
no
time
trying
the
door
a
shattering
stroke
of
his
scimitar
hewed
the
lock
asunder
and
as
he
sprang
through
to
the
stair
that
loomed
beyond
it
he
saw
the
head
and
shoulders
of
khosatral
crash
through
the
other
door
the
colossus
was
splintering
the
massive
panels
as
if
they
were
of
cardboard
conan
raced
up
the
stair
carrying
the
big
girl
over
one
shoulder
as
easily
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
where
he
was
going
he
had
no
idea
but
the
stair
ended
at
the
door
of
a
round
domed
chamber
khosatral
was
coming
up
the
stair
behind
them
silently
as
a
wind
of
death
and
as
swiftly
the
chamber
walls
were
of
solid
steel
and
so
was
the
door
conan
shut
it
and
dropped
in
place
the
great
bars
with
which
it
was
furnished
the
thought
struck
him
that
this
was
khosatral
chamber
where
he
locked
himself
in
to
sleep
securely
from
the
monsters
he
had
loosed
from
the
pits
to
do
his
bidding
hardly
were
the
bolts
in
place
when
the
great
door
shook
and
trembled
to
the
giant
assault
conan
shrugged
his
shoulders
this
was
the
end
of
the
trail
there
was
no
other
door
in
the
chamber
nor
any
window
air
and
the
strange
misty
light
evidently
came
from
interstices
in
the
dome
he
tested
the
nickel
edge
of
his
scimitar
quite
cool
now
that
he
was
at
bay
he
had
done
his
volcanic
best
to
escape
when
the
giant
came
crashing
through
that
door
he
would
explode
in
another
savage
onslaught
with
his
useless
sword
not
because
he
expected
it
to
do
any
good
but
because
it
was
his
nature
to
die
fighting
for
the
moment
there
was
no
course
of
action
to
take
and
his
calmness
was
not
forced
or
feigned
the
gaze
he
turned
on
his
fair
companion
was
as
admiring
and
intense
as
if
he
had
a
hundred
years
to
live
he
had
dumped
her
unceremoniously
on
the
floor
when
he
turned
to
close
the
door
and
she
had
risen
to
her
knees
mechanically
arranging
her
streaming
locks
and
her
scanty
garment
conan
fierce
eyes
glowed
with
approval
as
they
devoured
her
thick
golden
hair
her
clear
wide
eyes
her
milky
skin
sleek
with
exuberant
health
the
firm
swell
of
her
breasts
the
contours
of
her
splendid
hips
a
low
cry
escaped
her
as
the
door
shook
and
a
bolt
gave
way
with
a
groan
conan
did
not
look
around
he
knew
the
door
would
hold
a
little
while
longer
told
me
you
had
escaped
he
said
yuetshi
fisher
told
me
you
were
hiding
here
what
is
your
name
she
gasped
mechanically
then
words
came
in
a
rush
she
caught
at
him
with
desperate
fingers
mitra
what
nightmare
is
this
the
people
the
people
one
of
them
caught
me
in
the
forest
and
brought
me
here
they
carried
me
to
to
that
that
he
told
me
he
said
am
i
mad
is
this
a
dream
he
glanced
at
the
door
which
bulged
inward
as
if
from
the
impact
of
a
he
said
no
dream
that
hinge
is
giving
way
strange
that
a
devil
has
to
break
down
a
door
like
a
common
man
but
after
all
his
strength
itself
is
a
diabolism
you
not
kill
him
she
panted
are
strong
conan
was
too
honest
to
lie
a
mortal
man
could
kill
him
he
be
dead
now
he
answered
nicked
my
blade
on
his
belly
her
eyes
dulled
you
must
die
and
i
must
oh
mitra
she
screamed
in
sudden
frenzy
and
conan
caught
her
hands
fearing
that
she
would
harm
herself
told
me
what
he
was
going
to
do
to
me
she
panted
me
kill
me
with
your
sword
before
he
bursts
the
door
conan
looked
at
her
and
shook
his
head
do
what
i
can
he
said
wo
be
much
but
it
give
you
a
chance
to
get
past
him
down
the
stair
then
run
for
the
cliffs
i
have
a
boat
tied
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
if
you
can
get
out
of
the
palace
you
may
escape
him
yet
the
people
of
this
city
are
all
asleep
she
dropped
her
head
in
her
hands
conan
took
up
his
scimitar
and
moved
over
to
stand
before
the
echoing
door
one
watching
him
would
have
realized
that
he
was
waiting
for
a
death
he
regarded
as
inevitable
his
eyes
smoldered
more
vividly
his
muscular
hand
knotted
harder
on
his
hilt
that
was
all
the
hinges
had
given
under
the
giant
terrible
assault
and
the
door
rocked
crazily
held
only
by
the
bolts
and
these
solid
steel
bars
were
buckling
bending
bulging
out
of
their
sockets
conan
watched
in
an
almost
impersonal
fascination
envying
the
monster
his
inhuman
strength
then
without
warning
the
bombardment
ceased
in
the
stillness
conan
heard
other
noises
on
the
landing
outside
the
beat
of
wings
and
a
muttering
voice
that
was
like
the
whining
of
wind
through
midnight
branches
then
presently
there
was
silence
but
there
was
a
new
in
the
air
only
the
whetted
instincts
of
barbarism
could
have
sensed
it
but
conan
knew
without
seeing
or
hearing
him
leave
that
the
master
of
dagon
no
longer
stood
outside
the
door
he
glared
through
a
crack
that
had
been
started
in
the
steel
of
the
portal
the
landing
was
empty
he
drew
the
warped
bolts
and
cautiously
pulled
aside
the
sagging
door
khosatral
was
not
on
the
stair
but
far
below
he
heard
the
clang
of
a
metal
door
he
did
not
know
whether
the
giant
was
plotting
new
devilries
or
had
been
summoned
away
by
that
muttering
voice
but
he
wasted
no
time
in
conjectures
he
called
to
octavia
and
the
new
note
in
his
voice
brought
her
up
to
her
feet
and
to
his
side
almost
without
her
conscious
volition
is
it
she
gasped
stop
to
talk
he
caught
her
wrist
on
the
chance
for
action
had
transformed
him
his
eyes
blazed
his
voice
crackled
knife
he
muttered
while
almost
dragging
the
girl
down
the
stair
in
his
fierce
haste
magic
yuetshi
blade
he
left
it
in
the
dome
i
his
voice
died
suddenly
as
a
clear
mental
picture
sprang
up
before
him
the
dome
adjoined
the
great
room
where
stood
the
copper
throne
sweat
started
out
on
his
body
the
only
way
to
that
dome
was
through
that
room
with
its
copper
throne
and
the
foul
thing
that
slumbered
in
it
but
he
did
not
hesitate
swiftly
they
descended
the
stair
crossed
the
chamber
descended
the
next
stair
and
came
into
the
great
dim
hall
with
its
mysterious
hangings
they
had
seen
no
sign
of
the
colossus
halting
before
the
great
door
conan
caught
octavia
by
her
shoulders
and
shook
her
in
his
intensity
he
snapped
going
into
that
room
and
fasten
the
door
stand
here
and
listen
if
khosatral
comes
call
to
me
if
you
hear
me
cry
for
you
to
go
run
as
though
the
devil
were
on
your
heels
which
he
probably
will
be
make
for
that
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
because
i
be
past
helping
you
i
going
for
the
yuetshi
knife
before
she
could
voice
the
protest
her
lips
were
framing
he
had
slid
through
the
valves
and
shut
them
behind
him
he
lowered
the
bolt
cautiously
not
noticing
that
it
could
be
worked
from
the
outside
in
the
dim
twilight
his
gaze
sought
that
grim
copper
throne
yes
the
scaly
brute
was
still
there
filling
the
throne
with
its
loathsome
coils
he
saw
a
door
behind
the
throne
and
knew
that
it
led
into
the
dome
but
to
reach
it
he
must
mount
the
dais
a
few
feet
from
the
throne
itself
a
wind
blowing
across
the
green
floor
would
have
made
more
noise
than
conan
slinking
feet
eyes
glued
on
the
sleeping
reptile
he
reached
the
dais
and
mounted
the
glass
steps
the
snake
had
not
moved
he
was
reaching
for
the
door
the
bolt
on
the
bronze
portal
clanged
and
conan
stifled
an
awful
oath
as
he
saw
octavia
come
into
the
room
she
stared
about
uncertain
in
the
deeper
gloom
and
he
stood
frozen
not
daring
to
shout
a
warning
then
she
saw
his
shadowy
figure
and
ran
toward
the
dais
crying
want
to
go
with
you
i
afraid
to
stay
alone
she
threw
up
her
hands
with
a
terrible
scream
as
for
the
first
time
she
saw
the
occupant
of
the
throne
the
head
had
lifted
from
its
coils
and
thrust
out
toward
her
on
a
yard
of
shining
neck
conan
cleared
the
space
between
him
and
the
throne
with
a
desperate
bound
his
scimitar
swinging
with
all
his
power
and
with
such
blinding
speed
did
the
serpent
move
that
it
whipped
about
and
met
him
in
full
midair
lapping
his
limbs
and
body
with
half
a
dozen
coils
his
stroke
fell
futilely
as
he
crashed
down
on
the
dais
gashing
the
scaly
trunk
but
not
severing
it
then
he
was
writhing
on
the
glass
steps
with
fold
after
slimy
fold
knotting
about
him
twisting
crushing
killing
him
his
right
arm
was
still
free
but
he
could
get
no
purchase
to
strike
a
killing
blow
and
he
knew
one
blow
must
suffice
with
a
groaning
convulsion
of
muscular
expansion
that
bulged
his
veins
almost
to
bursting
on
his
temples
and
tied
his
muscles
in
quivering
tortured
knots
he
heaved
up
on
his
feet
lifting
almost
the
full
weight
of
that
devil
an
instant
he
reeled
on
legs
feeling
his
ribs
caving
in
on
his
vitals
and
his
sight
growing
dark
while
his
scimitar
gleamed
above
his
head
then
it
fell
shearing
through
the
scales
and
flesh
and
vertebrae
and
where
there
had
been
one
huge
writhing
cable
now
there
were
horribly
two
lashing
and
flopping
in
the
death
throes
conan
staggered
away
from
their
blind
strokes
he
was
sick
and
dizzy
and
blood
oozed
from
his
nose
groping
in
a
dark
mist
he
clutched
octavia
and
shook
her
until
she
gasped
for
breath
time
i
tell
you
to
stay
somewhere
he
gasped
stay
he
was
too
dizzy
even
to
know
whether
she
replied
taking
her
wrist
like
a
truant
schoolgirl
he
led
her
around
the
hideous
stumps
that
still
looped
and
knotted
on
the
floor
somewhere
in
the
distance
he
thought
he
heard
men
yelling
but
his
ears
were
still
roaring
so
that
he
could
not
be
sure
the
door
gave
to
his
efforts
if
khosatral
had
placed
the
snake
there
to
guard
the
thing
he
feared
evidently
he
considered
it
ample
precaution
conan
half
expected
some
other
monstrosity
to
leap
at
him
with
the
opening
of
the
door
but
in
the
dimmer
light
he
saw
only
the
vague
sweep
of
the
arch
above
a
dully
gleaming
block
of
gold
and
a
glimmer
on
the
stone
with
a
gasp
of
gratification
he
scooped
it
up
and
did
not
linger
for
further
exploration
he
turned
and
fled
across
the
room
and
down
the
great
hall
toward
the
distant
door
that
he
felt
led
to
the
outer
air
he
was
correct
a
few
minutes
later
he
emerged
into
the
silent
streets
half
carrying
half
guiding
his
companion
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
but
beyond
the
western
wall
there
sounded
cries
and
moaning
wails
that
made
octavia
tremble
he
led
her
to
the
southwestern
wall
and
without
difficulty
found
a
stone
stair
that
mounted
the
rampart
he
had
appropriated
a
thick
tapestry
rope
in
the
great
hall
and
now
having
reached
the
parapet
he
looped
the
soft
strong
cord
about
the
hips
and
lowered
her
to
the
earth
then
making
one
end
fast
to
a
merlon
he
slid
down
after
her
there
was
but
one
way
of
escape
from
the
island
the
stair
on
the
western
cliffs
in
that
direction
he
hurried
swinging
wide
around
the
spot
from
which
had
come
the
cries
and
the
sound
of
terrible
blows
octavia
sensed
that
grim
peril
lurked
in
those
leafy
fastnesses
her
breath
came
pantingly
and
she
pressed
close
to
her
protector
but
the
forest
was
silent
now
and
they
saw
no
shape
of
menace
until
they
emerged
from
the
trees
and
glimpsed
a
figure
standing
on
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
jehungir
agha
had
escaped
the
doom
that
had
overtaken
his
warriors
when
an
iron
giant
sallied
suddenly
from
the
gate
and
battered
and
crushed
them
into
bits
of
shredded
flesh
and
splintered
bone
when
he
saw
the
swords
of
his
archers
break
on
that
juggernaut
he
had
known
it
was
no
human
foe
they
faced
and
he
had
fled
hiding
in
the
deep
woods
until
the
sounds
of
slaughter
ceased
then
he
crept
back
to
the
stair
but
his
boatmen
were
not
waiting
for
him
they
had
heard
the
screams
and
presently
waiting
nervously
had
seen
on
the
cliff
above
them
a
monster
waving
gigantic
arms
in
awful
triumph
they
had
waited
for
no
more
when
jehungir
came
upon
the
cliffs
they
were
just
vanishing
among
the
reeds
beyond
khosatral
was
gone
had
either
returned
to
the
city
or
was
prowling
the
forest
in
search
of
the
man
who
had
escaped
him
outside
the
walls
jehungir
was
just
preparing
to
descend
the
stairs
and
depart
in
boat
when
he
saw
the
and
the
girl
emerge
from
the
trees
the
experience
which
had
congealed
his
blood
and
almost
blasted
his
reason
had
not
altered
jehungir
intentions
toward
the
chief
the
sight
of
the
man
he
had
come
to
kill
filled
him
with
gratification
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
girl
he
had
given
to
jelal
khan
but
he
wasted
no
time
on
her
lifting
his
bow
he
drew
the
shaft
to
its
head
and
loosed
conan
crouched
and
the
arrow
splintered
on
a
tree
and
conan
laughed
he
taunted
ca
hit
me
i
was
not
born
to
die
on
hyrkanian
steel
try
again
pig
of
turan
jehungir
did
not
try
again
that
was
his
last
arrow
he
drew
his
scimitar
and
advanced
confident
in
his
spired
helmet
and
mail
conan
met
him
in
a
blinding
whirl
of
swords
the
curved
blades
ground
together
sprang
apart
circled
in
glittering
arcs
that
blurred
the
sight
which
tried
to
follow
them
octavia
watching
did
not
see
the
stroke
but
she
heard
its
chopping
impact
and
saw
jehungir
fall
blood
spurting
from
his
side
where
the
cimmerian
steel
had
sundered
his
mail
and
bitten
to
his
spine
but
octavia
scream
was
not
caused
by
the
death
of
her
former
master
with
a
crash
of
bending
boughs
khosatral
khel
was
upon
them
the
girl
could
not
flee
a
moaning
cry
escaped
her
as
her
knees
gave
way
and
pitched
her
grovelling
to
the
sward
conan
stooping
above
the
body
of
the
agha
made
no
move
to
escape
shifting
his
reddened
scimitar
to
his
left
hand
he
drew
the
great
of
the
yuetshi
khosatral
khel
was
towering
above
him
his
arms
lifted
like
mauls
but
as
the
blade
caught
the
sheen
of
the
sun
the
giant
gave
back
suddenly
but
conan
blood
was
up
he
rushed
in
slashing
with
the
crescent
blade
and
it
did
not
splinter
under
its
edge
the
dusky
metal
of
khosatral
body
gave
way
like
common
flesh
beneath
a
cleaver
from
the
deep
gash
flowed
a
strange
ichor
and
khosatral
cried
out
like
the
dirging
of
a
great
bell
his
terrible
arms
flailed
down
but
conan
quicker
than
the
archers
who
had
died
beneath
those
awful
flails
avoided
their
strokes
and
struck
again
and
yet
again
khosatral
reeled
and
tottered
his
cries
were
awful
to
hear
as
if
metal
were
given
a
tongue
of
pain
as
if
iron
shrieked
and
bellowed
under
torment
then
wheeling
away
he
staggered
into
the
forest
he
reeled
in
his
gait
crashed
through
bushes
and
caromed
off
trees
yet
though
conan
followed
him
with
the
speed
of
hot
passion
the
walls
and
towers
of
dagon
loomed
through
the
trees
before
the
man
came
within
of
the
giant
then
khosatral
turned
again
flailing
the
air
with
desperate
blows
but
conan
fired
to
berserk
fury
was
not
to
be
denied
as
a
panther
strikes
down
a
bull
moose
at
bay
so
he
plunged
under
the
bludgeoning
arms
and
drove
the
crescent
blade
to
the
hilt
under
the
spot
where
a
heart
would
be
khosatral
reeled
and
fell
in
the
shape
of
a
man
he
reeled
but
it
was
not
the
shape
of
a
man
that
struck
the
loam
where
there
had
been
the
likeness
of
a
human
face
there
was
no
face
at
all
and
the
metal
limbs
melted
and
changed
conan
who
had
not
shrunk
from
khosatral
living
recoiled
blenching
from
khosatral
dead
for
he
had
witnessed
an
awful
transmutation
in
his
dying
throes
khosatral
khel
had
become
again
the
that
had
crawled
up
from
the
abyss
millenniums
gone
gagging
with
intolerable
repugnance
conan
turned
to
flee
the
sight
and
he
was
suddenly
aware
that
the
pinnacles
of
dagon
no
longer
glimmered
through
the
trees
they
had
faded
like
smoke
the
battlements
the
crenellated
towers
the
great
bronze
gates
the
velvets
the
gold
the
ivory
and
the
women
and
the
men
with
their
shaven
skulls
with
the
passing
of
the
inhuman
intellect
which
had
given
them
rebirth
they
had
faded
back
into
the
dust
which
they
had
been
for
ages
uncounted
only
the
stumps
of
broken
columns
rose
above
crumbling
walls
and
broken
paves
and
shattered
dome
conan
again
looked
upon
the
ruins
of
xapur
as
he
remembered
them
the
wild
stood
like
a
statue
for
a
space
dimly
grasping
something
of
the
cosmic
tragedy
of
the
fitful
ephemera
called
mankind
and
the
hooded
shapes
of
darkness
which
prey
upon
it
then
as
he
heard
his
name
called
in
accents
of
fear
he
started
as
one
awaking
from
a
dream
glanced
again
at
the
thing
on
the
ground
shuddered
and
turned
away
toward
the
cliffs
and
the
girl
that
waited
there
she
was
peering
fearfully
under
the
trees
and
she
greeted
him
with
a
cry
of
relief
he
had
shaken
off
the
dim
monstrous
visions
which
had
momentarily
haunted
him
and
was
his
exuberant
self
again
is
she
shuddered
back
to
hell
whence
he
crawled
he
replied
cheerfully
did
you
climb
the
stair
and
make
your
escape
in
my
boat
would
desert
she
began
then
changed
her
mind
and
amended
rather
sulkily
have
nowhere
to
go
the
hyrkanians
would
enslave
me
again
and
the
pirates
would
of
the
he
suggested
they
better
than
the
pirates
she
asked
scornfully
admiration
increased
to
see
how
well
she
had
recovered
her
poise
after
having
endured
such
frantic
terror
her
arrogance
amused
him
seemed
to
think
so
in
the
camp
by
ghori
he
answered
were
free
enough
with
your
smiles
then
her
red
lip
curled
in
disdain
you
think
i
was
enamored
of
you
do
you
dream
that
i
would
have
shamed
myself
before
an
barbarian
unless
i
had
to
my
master
whose
body
lies
there
forced
me
to
do
as
i
did
conan
seemed
rather
crestfallen
then
he
laughed
with
undiminished
zest
matter
you
belong
to
me
now
give
me
a
kiss
dare
ask
she
began
angrily
when
she
felt
herself
snatched
off
her
feet
and
crushed
to
the
muscular
breast
she
fought
him
fiercely
with
all
the
supple
strength
of
her
magnificent
youth
but
he
only
laughed
exuberantly
drunk
with
his
possession
of
this
splendid
creature
writhing
in
his
arms
he
crushed
her
struggles
easily
drinking
the
nectar
of
her
lips
with
all
the
unrestrained
passion
that
was
his
until
the
arms
that
strained
against
him
melted
and
twined
convulsively
about
his
massive
neck
then
he
laughed
down
into
the
clear
eyes
and
said
should
not
a
chief
of
the
free
people
be
preferable
to
a
dog
of
turan
she
shook
back
her
tawny
locks
still
tingling
in
every
nerve
from
the
fire
of
his
kisses
she
did
not
loosen
her
arms
from
his
neck
you
deem
yourself
an
agha
equal
she
challenged
he
laughed
and
strode
with
her
in
his
arms
toward
the
stair
shall
judge
he
boasted
burn
khawarizm
for
a
torch
to
light
your
way
to
my
tent
