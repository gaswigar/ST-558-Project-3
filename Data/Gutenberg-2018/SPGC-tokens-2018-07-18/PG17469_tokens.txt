valerie
a
writer
admits
that
he
has
an
affection
for
something
which
he
has
written
it
is
high
time
to
pray
for
his
soul
yet
i
make
bold
to
confess
that
there
are
in
this
book
some
passages
which
i
hold
dear
a
seeming
vanity
which
must
be
times
you
have
found
me
at
work
upon
these
chapters
often
you
have
taken
pages
of
manuscript
from
my
table
and
sitting
down
in
a
chair
deciphered
them
for
what
they
were
worth
once
or
twice
whilst
you
read
you
have
fallen
into
silvery
you
wonder
that
i
treasure
the
sentences
which
drew
forth
such
music
is
my
many
as
see
you
are
glad
of
the
sight
all
who
know
you
are
proud
of
the
honour
but
the
man
whose
efforts
your
mirth
has
commended
is
the
proudest
and
happiest
of
the
i
say
that
your
name
is
not
valerie
i
think
not
you
will
know

chapter
i
how
will
noggin
was
fooled
and
berry
rode
forth
against
his
will
who
going
to
church
said
daphne
consulting
her
there
was
a
profound
silence
my
sister
turned
to
jill
are
you
coming
she
said
berry
and
i
are
i
beg
your
pardon
said
her
husband
of
course
you
coming
said
daphne
not
in
these
trousers
this
is
the
first
time
i
worn
them
and
not
going
to
kneel
in
them
for
any
one
then
you
change
said
his
wife
you
plenty
of
time
berry
groaned
this
is
sheer
bolshevism
he
said
is
not
my
soul
my
own
we
shall
start
said
daphne
in
twenty
minutes
it
was
nearly
ten
in
the
morning
of
a
beautiful
summer
day
and
we
were
all
taking
our
ease
in
the
sunshine
upon
the
terrace
it
was
the
first
sunday
which
we
had
spent
all
together
at
white
ladies
for
nearly
five
years
so
far
as
the
eye
could
see
nothing
had
changed
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
the
great
smooth
lawn
stretched
like
a
fine
green
carpet
its
shadowed
patches
yet
bright
with
dew
there
were
the
tall
elms
and
the
copper
beech
and
all
the
proud
company
of
spreading
giants
what
were
five
years
to
them
there
was
the
clump
of
rhododendrons
a
ragged
blotch
of
crimson
seemingly
spilled
upon
the
green
turf
and
there
the
close
box
hedge
that
walled
away
the
beyond
the
sunk
fence
a
gap
showed
an
acre
or
so
of
mead
a
great
deep
meadow
and
in
it
two
horses
beneath
a
chestnut
tree
their
long
tails
sleepily
nosing
each
other
to
rout
the
flies
while
in
the
distance
the
haze
of
heat
hung
like
a
film
over
the
rolling
hills
close
at
hand
echoed
the
soft
impertinence
of
a
cuckoo
and
two
fat
waddled
about
the
lawn
picking
and
stealing
as
they
went
the
sky
was
cloudless
and
there
was
not
a
breath
of
wind
the
stable
clock
chimed
the
my
sister
returned
to
the
attack
are
you
coming
boy
yes
said
i
i
am
berry
sat
up
and
stared
at
me
do
be
silly
he
said
there
a
service
this
morning
besides
they
changed
the
lock
of
the
i
want
to
watch
the
vicar
face
when
he
sees
you
said
i
it
will
be
a
bit
of
a
shock
said
jonah
looking
up
from
the
paper
is
his
heart
all
right
rotten
said
daphne
but
that
does
matter
i
sent
him
a
note
to
warn
him
yesterday
what
did
you
say
demanded
her
husband
i
said
back
at
last
and
do
faint
we
all
coming
to
church
and
you
got
to
come
back
to
and
now
for
goodness
sake
go
and
change
but
we
shall
perspire
said
berry
profusely
to
walk
half
a
mile
in
this
sun
is
simply
asking
for
it
besides
what
the
car
done
said
jonah
i
going
and
i
ca
hurry
with
this
he
tapped
his
short
leg
affectionately
we
need
take
fitch
boy
or
i
can
drive
right
oh
said
my
sister
rising
is
early
enough
jonah
nodded
this
said
berry
is
a
conspiracy
for
which
you
will
all
pay
literally
i
shall
take
the
plate
round
and
from
you
four
i
shall
accept
nothing
but
paper
possibly
i
shall
here
the
girls
fell
upon
him
and
bore
him
protesting
into
the
house
and
out
of
earshot
who
going
to
look
after
the
car
while
we
in
church
said
i
there
sure
to
be
somebody
ready
to
earn
a
couple
of
bob
said
jonah
besides
we
can
always
disconnect
the
trunnion
or
jack
her
up
and
put
the
wheels
in
the
vestry
or
something
all
right
only
we
do
want
her
pinched
with
a
yawn
i
rose
to
my
feet
and
now
i
suppose
i
better
go
and
turn
her
out
right
oh
said
jonah
picking
up
his
paper
again
i
strolled
into
the
house
we
were
proud
of
the
car
she
was
a
rolls
and
we
had
bought
her
at
a
long
price
less
than
a
week
ago
fresh
from
the
her
touring
body
was
painted
while
her
bonnet
was
of
polished
aluminium
fitted
with
every
conceivable
accessory
she
was
very
charming
alike
to
ride
or
drive
and
she
went
like
the
wind
in
a
word
she
did
as
handsome
as
she
was
it
was
eight
minutes
to
eleven
as
we
slid
past
the
lodge
and
on
to
the
bilberry
road
before
we
had
covered
two
furlongs
we
swung
round
a
corner
to
see
a
smart
at
rest
by
the
dusty
hedgerow
and
a
slight
dark
girl
in
fresh
blue
and
white
standing
with
one
foot
on
the
step
wiping
her
dainty
fingers
on
a
handful
of
agatha
cried
daphne
and
jill
stop
boy
stop
obediently
i
slowed
to
a
standstill
as
my
lady
came
running
after
us
you
might
have
told
me
she
panted
i
never
knew
you
were
back
and
i
am
so
glad
we
only
arrived
on
friday
dear
said
daphne
and
introduced
berry
and
me
jonah
it
appeared
had
met
miss
deriot
at
tennis
in
but
you
had
your
hair
down
then
he
said
gravely
it
a
wonder
i
have
got
it
down
now
said
miss
deriot
why
you
come
along
ten
minutes
earlier
then
you
could
have
changed
my
tire
and
why
are
you
driving
away
from
church
said
jill
one
of
the
colts
has
sprained
his
shoulder
and
we
out
of
embrocation
so
i
going
to
get
some
from
brooch
i
come
with
you
said
berry
eagerly
preparing
to
leave
the
car
i
do
like
to
think
of
you
nonsense
said
daphne
detaining
him
but
supposing
she
has
another
puncture
yes
i
can
see
you
mending
it
on
a
day
like
this
it
very
kind
of
you
said
miss
deriot
with
a
puzzled
smile
do
thank
the
fool
said
my
sister
if
i
thought
he
be
the
slightest
use
to
you
i
send
him
but
he
only
wants
an
excuse
to
get
out
of
going
to
church
poor
jade
said
her
husband
i
am
a
knight
a
simple
starlit
knight
a
quixote
of
your
brutish
instincts
carry
on
boy
said
daphne
i
let
in
the
clutch
and
come
over
this
afternoon
agatha
and
we
tell
you
all
about
everything
yes
do
cried
jill
all
right
said
miss
deriot
so
long
three
minutes
later
i
was
berthing
the
car
close
to
the
in
the
shade
of
limes
that
made
a
trembling
screen
of
foliage
within
the
churchyard
wall
as
luck
would
have
it
will
noggin
once
a
groom
in
our
service
and
now
a
trooper
of
the
dragoon
guards
was
leaning
lazily
against
the
grey
wall
taking
his
ease
as
we
drew
abreast
of
him
he
stood
to
attention
and
saluted
a
pleased
grin
of
recognition
lighting
his
healthy
face
we
greeted
him
gladly
glad
to
see
you
all
right
will
said
jill
thank
you
miss
are
you
going
to
church
said
daphne
not
m
i
on
leave
and
i
my
share
o
church
parades
i
the
last
four
years
m
we
all
laughed
well
if
you
not
going
said
i
we
want
some
one
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
car
i
do
it
gladly
sir
right
oh
she
a
pretty
piece
of
goods
is
she
she
is
that
sir
said
will
visibly
impressed
as
i
followed
the
others
into
the
porch
i
glanced
back
to
see
our
sentinel
walking
about
his
charge
bending
an
appreciative
gaze
upon
her
points
they
were
singing
the
on
the
ledge
of
our
old
pew
lay
a
note
addressed
to
major
pleydell
in
the
vicar
handwriting
when
berry
had
read
it
he
passed
it
to
daphne
and
i
was
able
to
read
it
over
her
shoulder
major
in
the
old
days
you
used
to
read
the
lessons
i
think
we
should
all
like
it
if
you
would
do
so
but
do
if
you
want
very
sincerely
in
a
postscript
the
writer
named
the
appointed
passages
of
holy
writ
so
soon
as
the
first
psalm
had
started
berry
stepped
to
the
lectern
found
his
places
and
cast
his
eye
over
the
text
before
the
second
psalm
was
finished
he
was
once
more
in
his
place
doors
and
windows
were
open
as
wide
as
they
could
be
set
and
the
little
church
was
flooded
with
light
and
fresh
warm
air
that
coaxed
the
edge
from
the
chill
of
thick
stone
walls
and
pillars
and
made
the
frozen
pavements
cool
and
refreshing
mustiness
was
clean
gone
swept
from
her
frequent
haunts
by
the
sweet
breath
of
nature
the
dim
religious
light
of
milton
ordering
was
this
day
displaced
by
summer
honest
smile
simpler
maybe
but
no
less
reverent
and
when
the
singing
was
stilled
you
overheard
the
ceaseless
sleepy
murmur
of
that
country
choir
of
birds
and
beasts
and
insects
that
keeps
its
rare
contented
symphony
for
summer
days
in
which
you
can
find
no
fault
my
impious
eye
wandered
affectionately
over
familiar
friends
the
old
oak
pews
almost
the
spanish
organ
the
reluctant
gift
of
a
proud
galleon
wrecked
on
the
snarling
coast
ten
miles
away
the
old
with
its
dull
crimson
cushions
and
the
fringed
cloths
that
hung
so
stiffly
a
shaft
of
sunlight
beat
full
on
an
old
black
hatchment
making
known
the
faded
quarterings
while
underneath
a
slender
panel
of
brass
but
two
years
old
showed
that
the
teaching
of
its
grim
forbear
had
not
been
vain
for
so
fair
a
morning
bilberry
village
had
done
well
the
church
was
full
and
though
there
were
many
strange
faces
it
was
pleasant
here
and
there
to
recognize
one
we
had
known
in
the
old
days
and
to
learn
from
an
involuntary
smile
that
we
had
not
been
forgotten
it
was
just
after
the
beginning
of
the
second
lesson
that
we
heard
the
engine
start
there
was
no
mistaking
the
purr
of
our
for
a
second
the
girls
and
jonah
and
i
stared
at
one
another
then
with
one
impulse
we
all
started
instinctively
to
our
feet
as
i
left
the
pew
i
heard
daphne
whisper
hsh
we
ca
all
and
she
and
jonah
and
jill
sank
back
twittering
berry
eyes
met
mine
for
an
instant
as
i
stepped
into
the
aisle
they
spoke
volumes
but
to
his
eternal
credit
his
voice
never
faltered
i
almost
ran
to
the
porch
and
i
reached
the
to
see
our
beautiful
car
piloted
by
a
man
in
a
grey
hat
scudding
up
the
straight
white
road
while
in
her
wake
tore
a
gesticulating
trooper
shouting
impotently
ridiculously
even
as
i
watched
the
car
flashed
round
a
bend
and
disappeared
for
a
moment
i
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
stupefied
then
i
heard
a
horn
sounded
behind
me
and
i
mechanically
stepped
to
one
side
fifty
yards
away
was
the
we
had
encountered
on
our
way
to
church
frantically
i
signalled
to
the
girl
at
the
wheel
as
i
did
so
a
burst
of
music
signified
that
the
second
lesson
had
come
to
an
end
whatever
the
matter
cried
miss
deriot
as
she
pulled
up
somebody
pinched
the
rolls
will
you
of
course
get
in
which
way
did
they
go
straight
ahead
said
i
opening
the
door
we
were
well
under
way
before
i
had
taken
my
seat
as
we
came
to
the
bend
i
threw
a
glance
over
my
shoulder
to
see
four
figures
that
i
knew
standing
without
the
they
appeared
to
be
arguing
as
we
turned
the
corner
a
stentorian
voice
yelled
the
bloodstock
road
sir
i
can
see
their
blinkin
dust
perched
on
one
of
the
lower
branches
of
a
wayside
oak
will
noggin
was
pointing
a
shaking
finger
in
the
direction
he
named
we
were
less
than
three
miles
from
bloodstock
when
the
off
hind
tire
burst
miss
deriot
brought
the
car
to
the
side
of
the
road
and
stopped
in
the
shadow
of
an
old
barn
that
she
said
has
just
done
it
i
opened
the
door
and
stepped
down
into
the
road
it
means
a
delay
when
we
least
want
it
said
i
ruefully
worse
i
had
one
burst
already
and
i
only
brought
one
spare
wheel
i
whistled
then
we
are
indeed
done
said
i
i
awfully
sorry
heaven
knows
how
far
you
are
from
your
home
this
comes
of
helping
a
comparative
stranger
let
it
be
a
lesson
to
you
my
companion
smiled
i
do
mind
for
myself
she
said
but
what
about
your
car
i
spread
out
my
hands
reason
dictates
that
i
should
it
to
bloodstock
and
try
and
get
the
police
moving
but
i
ca
leave
you
here
you
can
easily
but
you
not
going
to
i
do
want
to
sit
here
for
the
rest
of
the
day
she
pointed
to
the
barn
help
me
to
get
her
in
here
and
then
we
push
off
to
bloodstock
together
a
hurried
reconnaissance
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
little
farmhouse
and
two
minutes
later
i
was
making
urgent
representations
to
the
owner
of
the
barn
to
our
relief
the
latter
proved
sympathetic
and
obliging
and
before
we
again
took
to
the
road
the
was
safely
under
lock
and
key
and
now
said
miss
deriot
how
did
it
happen
the
theft
i
ca
imagine
we
left
that
fool
who
yelled
at
us
in
charge
i
suppose
he
left
her
to
get
a
drink
or
something
this
is
only
the
fourth
time
we
had
her
out
i
added
gloomily
oh
i
say
never
mind
you
bound
to
get
her
again
look
at
that
is
it
lovely
i
wish
i
could
paint
can
you
i
painted
a
once
it
was
hung
too
outside
the
stillroom
pity
you
did
keep
it
up
said
miss
deriot
it
a
shame
to
waste
talent
like
that
is
it
just
broiling
i
should
love
a
bathe
now
i
hope
you
do
wear
stockings
in
the
water
said
i
miss
deriot
glanced
at
her
white
ankles
is
that
a
reflection
she
demanded
i
shook
my
head
by
no
manner
of
means
but
there
a
place
for
everything
is
there
i
mean
we
both
laughed
that
better
said
my
companion
i
could
bear
to
see
you
so
worried
this
beautiful
morning
my
dear
said
i
you
a
nice
kind
heart
and
i
thank
you
do
mention
it
said
miss
deriot
from
the
crown
of
her
hat
to
the
soles
of
her
buckskin
shoes
she
was
the
pink
of
daintiness
health
was
springing
in
her
fresh
cheeks
eagerness
danced
in
her
eyes
energy
leapt
from
her
carriage
had
she
been
haughty
you
would
have
labelled
her
diana
and
have
done
with
it
but
her
eyes
were
gentle
and
there
was
a
tenderness
about
her
small
mouth
that
must
have
pardoned
actæon
a
plain
gold
on
a
black
silk
strap
was
all
her
jewellery
we
better
strike
across
the
next
field
said
miss
deriot
there
a
path
that
bring
us
out
opposite
it
save
us
about
five
minutes
you
might
have
been
born
here
said
i
i
was
said
agatha
she
nodded
towards
a
beech
wood
that
stood
a
furlong
away
the
trees
hide
the
house
but
we
left
when
i
was
seven
and
only
came
back
to
the
county
five
years
ago
and
here
our
field
the
gate
was
padlocked
i
looked
at
my
companion
shall
i
get
over
advance
ten
paces
and
gaze
into
the
middle
distance
or
are
you
that
sort
miss
deriot
flung
back
her
head
and
laughed
i
rather
you
gave
me
a
leg
up
she
said
with
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
a
foot
in
my
hand
she
was
up
and
over
in
an
instant
i
vaulted
after
her
you
know
i
said
we
ought
to
perform
you
and
i
with
a
ladder
a
slack
wire
and
a
little
practice
we
should
do
wonders
on
days
i
might
even
lift
you
with
my
teeth
that
always
goes
well
and
no
one
would
know
you
were
as
light
as
a
seven
stone
three
in
the
bathroom
said
agatha
without
stockings
some
we
were
going
uphill
the
meadow
through
which
we
were
passing
sloped
to
an
oaken
fence
stoutly
constructed
to
save
the
cattle
from
a
perilous
fall
for
on
its
farther
side
the
ground
fell
away
sheer
so
that
at
this
point
a
bluff
formed
one
high
wall
of
the
sunken
road
for
which
we
were
making
i
remembered
stood
immediately
opposite
to
the
rough
steps
hewn
years
ago
for
the
convenience
of
such
passengers
as
we
there
was
a
stile
set
in
the
fence
and
as
i
swung
myself
over
i
glanced
down
past
the
edge
of
the
bluff
and
into
the
road
below
in
the
little
curved
space
that
fronted
the
inn
the
rolls
was
standing
silent
and
unoccupied
i
must
have
exclaimed
for
agatha
was
over
the
stile
in
an
instant
and
asking
me
what
was
the
matter
then
she
saw
and
the
words
died
on
her
lips
together
we
stood
the
door
of
the
inn
was
shut
and
there
was
no
one
in
sight
my
first
impulse
was
to
dart
down
the
steps
beat
upon
the
door
of
the
tavern
and
confront
the
thief
but
valour
yielded
to
discretion
the
great
thing
was
to
recover
the
car
i
had
but
a
slip
of
a
girl
with
me
the
spot
was
a
lonely
one
and
it
was
more
than
likely
that
the
highwayman
was
not
working
alone
besides
agatha
must
not
be
involved
in
any
violence
i
turned
to
my
lady
you
stay
here
i
going
to
take
her
and
drive
straight
to
the
i
pick
up
some
police
and
come
back
just
as
quickly
as
ever
i
can
miss
deriot
shook
her
pretty
head
i
coming
with
you
she
said
carry
on
but
my
dear
i
often
wish
i
was
so
obstinate
she
spoke
meditatively
but
all
like
that
mules
are
in
it
with
the
deriots
she
added
with
a
dazzling
smile
neither
apparently
are
cucumbers
said
i
and
with
that
i
began
to
descend
the
rough
stairs
stepping
as
delicately
as
i
could
down
i
turned
to
look
at
my
companion
and
at
that
moment
the
step
upon
which
i
was
standing
gave
way
the
scrambling
sounds
which
proclaimed
my
fall
were
followed
by
the
rasping
protest
of
yielding
cloth
and
i
came
to
rest
six
feet
from
the
road
at
the
expense
of
a
coat
which
had
caught
the
corner
of
one
of
the
unplaned
risers
all
had
been
so
still
that
in
that
hollow
place
the
noise
could
not
have
failed
to
attract
the
attention
of
any
one
who
was
within
earshot
and
i
lay
for
a
moment
where
i
had
fallen
straining
my
ears
for
the
sound
of
footsteps
or
voices
are
you
all
right
whispered
a
soft
voice
above
me
i
turned
my
head
and
nodded
miss
deriot
standing
with
clasped
hands
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
prepared
to
continue
her
descent
gingerly
i
stepped
down
into
the
sandy
road
and
started
to
cross
it
facing
towards
bloodstock
the
car
presented
her
off
side
to
us
with
the
utmost
caution
i
proceeded
to
induct
myself
into
the
seat
as
i
sat
down
miss
deriot
slipped
in
front
of
the
bonnet
and
round
to
the
near
side
she
was
opening
the
high
and
my
foot
was
on
the
when
i
heard
the
murmur
of
voices
we
were
not
a
second
too
soon
the
moment
i
had
started
the
engine
there
was
a
cry
followed
by
the
clattering
of
heavy
shoes
upon
cobbles
and
as
the
car
slid
into
the
road
a
man
in
a
grey
hat
came
tearing
out
of
the
inn
courtyard
waving
his
arms
and
yelling
like
one
possessed
hard
on
his
heels
came
pounding
his
supporters
three
of
them
all
bellowing
like
bulls
so
much
i
saw
for
myself
agatha
kneeling
on
the
seat
by
my
side
kept
me
informed
of
their
movements
till
we
swept
out
of
sight
he
simply
dancing
the
one
in
the
grey
hat
i
mean
now
he
shaking
his
fist
at
us
oh
he
mad
he
thrown
his
hat
on
the
ground
boy
he
trying
to
kick
one
of
the
others
oh
i
wish
you
could
see
the
merry
voice
dissolved
into
peals
of
laughter
then
the
road
curled
and
agatha
turned
left
about
and
settled
herself
by
my
side
how
did
you
know
my
christian
name
i
demanded
your
sister
used
it
this
morning
you
see
i
forgotten
your
other
and
i
ca
keep
on
saying
but
i
wo
do
it
again
please
agatha
deriot
one
i
say
you
torn
your
coat
properly
it
feels
as
if
it
was
in
two
pieces
said
i
if
it
was
for
the
collar
it
would
be
said
agatha
never
mind
bare
backs
are
still
fashionable
and
what
a
torn
coat
when
got
the
car
again
you
right
i
agreed
you
hardly
believe
it
i
added
but
i
can
tell
from
the
feel
of
her
that
some
stranger
been
driving
i
can
believe
it
after
all
a
car
just
like
a
horse
as
she
spoke
we
sped
into
the
market
square
of
bloodstock
the
police
station
stood
in
love
lane
a
couple
of
streets
away
here
a
disappointment
was
in
store
the
sole
representative
of
the
law
was
a
station
sergeant
in
his
and
a
state
of
profuse
perspiration
between
his
lips
was
a
penholder
and
he
held
a
telephone
receiver
to
his
left
ear
in
an
adjoining
room
the
bell
of
another
telephone
was
ringing
violently
in
long
regular
spasms
while
somewhere
quite
close
a
dog
was
giving
ceaseless
vent
to
those
short
sharp
barks
which
denote
impatience
of
detention
a
sudden
elevation
of
the
sergeant
eyebrows
invited
me
to
state
my
business
but
before
i
had
spoken
two
sentences
he
shifted
the
penholder
from
his
mouth
and
shook
his
head
i
ca
you
at
the
moment
sir
that
the
third
car
been
stole
in
this
distric
this
mornin
there
a
gang
of
about
every
one
excep
me
out
after
now
knows
when
they
come
in
an
there
that
other
telephone
goin
like
mad
the
chief
constable
lef
his
tied
up
there
an
wo
let
me
within
six
foot
of
it
he
turned
to
blare
into
the
mouthpiece
you
you
wot
oh
i
ca
bear
it
for
sake
the
line
he
set
down
the
receiver
shook
the
sweat
out
of
his
eyes
and
sank
on
to
a
stool
another
blinkin
car
gone
he
said
hoarsely
i
dunno
wot
the
matter
with
the
world
i
wish
i
was
back
in
france
love
lane
was
a
narrow
street
so
i
did
not
attempt
to
turn
the
car
but
drove
on
and
presently
out
of
the
town
by
back
streets
on
to
the
bilberry
road
it
would
have
been
better
if
i
had
telephoned
to
white
ladies
before
leaving
bloodstock
to
announce
my
recovery
of
the
car
but
i
was
expecting
to
be
back
there
so
soon
that
it
seemed
unnecessary
indeed
it
was
only
when
we
were
once
more
under
way
that
i
thought
of
the
colt
and
the
embrocation
to
say
nothing
of
my
lady
now
standing
helpless
in
the
gloom
of
the
wayside
barn
i
tell
you
what
said
i
we
drive
to
the
barn
and
pick
up
the
lotion
and
then
i
take
you
home
then
i
can
run
your
chauffeur
back
to
the
barn
with
a
spare
cover
drop
him
there
and
push
off
to
white
ladies
i
can
improve
on
that
said
agatha
with
a
glance
at
her
wrist
be
past
one
by
the
time
we
get
home
so
you
must
stay
to
lunch
you
can
telephone
to
white
ladies
from
there
and
afterwards
i
go
back
with
you
i
was
to
come
over
this
afternoon
was
i
and
we
can
drop
the
chauffeur
at
the
barn
on
the
way
and
he
can
come
for
me
in
the
evening
agatha
was
living
at
broadacre
a
fine
old
place
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
itself
and
thither
we
came
without
incident
just
as
an
gong
was
summoning
the
household
to
meat
admiral
and
deriot
were
kindness
itself
first
i
was
given
a
long
cold
grateful
drink
then
the
old
sailor
led
me
to
his
own
chamber
and
ministered
personally
to
my
wants
my
coat
was
given
to
a
maid
to
be
roughly
stitched
and
when
i
appeared
at
luncheon
it
was
in
a
jacket
belonging
to
my
host
our
story
was
told
and
retold
the
lawlessness
of
the
year
of
grace
was
bewailed
and
a
violent
denunciation
of
was
succeeded
by
a
bitter
proscription
of
the
county
police
in
the
midst
of
my
entertainment
i
remembered
that
i
had
not
telephoned
to
white
ladies
but
the
servant
sent
to
make
the
connection
was
informed
by
the
exchange
that
the
line
was
out
of
order
i
expect
it
fused
said
i
with
berry
at
one
end
and
that
station
sergeant
at
the
other
the
strain
must
have
been
fearful
it
was
two
before
we
were
once
more
in
the
car
on
the
back
seat
sat
the
deriots
chauffeur
holding
a
spare
wheel
between
his
knees
it
did
not
take
us
long
to
reach
the
barn
and
so
soon
as
we
had
once
more
unearthed
the
farmer
authorized
him
to
suffer
the
chauffeur
to
remove
the
and
discharged
our
debt
for
accommodation
i
turned
the
rolls
round
and
headed
for
white
ladies
she
certainly
a
beautiful
car
said
agatha
as
the
rolls
sailed
up
a
treacherously
steep
gradient
on
top
it
like
being
in
a
lift
and
but
for
you
we
might
never
have
seen
her
again
shall
i
give
you
a
stamp
album
or
would
you
like
to
drive
really
mean
that
said
miss
deriot
i
shot
her
a
glance
there
was
no
mistaking
the
eagerness
of
her
parted
lips
and
the
sparkle
of
her
gay
brown
eyes
by
way
of
replying
i
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
a
moment
later
we
had
changed
places
it
awfully
kind
of
you
said
agatha
delightedly
as
she
let
in
the
clutch
i
always
wanted
to
drive
a
rolls
i
hope
i
sha
hurt
her
you
do
her
good
said
i
i
watched
you
in
the
got
beautiful
hands
thank
you
boy
now
you
shall
have
a
stamp
album
as
well
go
carefully
here
there
used
to
be
a
wasps
nest
in
that
bank
but
it
closed
now
same
as
the
german
banks
what
a
war
but
i
do
collect
stamps
then
she
shall
have
a
dog
what
about
a
sealyham
to
sleep
on
your
bed
and
bite
the
postman
i
love
one
said
agatha
and
you
sit
up
in
bed
in
the
morning
with
your
hair
all
about
your
eyes
and
smile
at
him
and
he
growl
back
at
you
i
can
just
see
you
thanks
awfully
but
you
wrong
about
my
hair
is
it
never
unruly
only
by
day
i
wish
to
goodness
i
could
wear
it
down
so
do
i
then
we
could
all
sit
on
it
when
the
grass
was
wet
at
the
moment
there
a
particularly
beautiful
tress
caressing
your
left
shoulder
and
i
think
you
ought
to
know
that
the
wind
is
kissing
it
quite
openly
it
all
very
embarrassing
i
hope
i
sha
catch
it
i
added
cheerfully
miss
deriot
made
a
supreme
effort
to
look
severe
if
you
do
she
said
uncertainly
i
shall
drive
straight
into
the
said
i
reprovingly
you
ought
to
jest
about
such
things
you
might
catch
it
yourself
easily
here
we
passed
the
you
know
you
never
be
able
to
look
fierce
so
long
as
you
have
that
dimple
you
have
to
fill
it
up
or
something
i
suppose
it
full
of
dew
every
morning
now
without
a
word
agatha
slowed
down
turned
up
a
and
stopped
then
she
proceeded
to
back
the
car
what
on
earth
is
she
doing
said
i
she
turned
a
glowing
face
to
mine
going
back
to
the
she
flashed
i
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
and
she
stopped
my
dear
if
you
must
have
a
bath
you
shall
have
one
directly
you
get
to
white
ladies
i
turn
on
the
water
for
you
but
let
me
beg
of
you
if
i
go
on
will
you
promise
to
behave
faithfully
and
fold
your
arms
and
sit
like
a
groom
all
the
way
i
suppose
you
could
make
it
a
footman
then
i
could
stand
on
the
petrol
tank
however
as
it
your
birthday
i
folded
my
arms
with
a
sigh
instantly
agatha
leaned
towards
me
with
a
dazzling
smile
good
boy
she
said
in
a
caressing
tone
now
he
shall
have
a
stamp
album
but
i
do
collect
stamps
the
smile
deepened
but
for
her
red
mouth
her
little
white
teeth
would
have
been
the
prettiest
things
in
the
world
well
i
thought
of
a
stamp
album
she
said
slowly
however
as
your
birthday
a
minute
later
we
were
back
in
the
main
road
by
my
direction
miss
deriot
drove
straight
to
the
stables
and
we
left
the
car
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
yard
as
we
walked
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
we
wo
tell
the
others
that
we
found
her
just
yet
said
i
we
hear
what
they
got
to
say
first
perhaps
they
all
out
looking
for
her
said
agatha
not
all
daphne
sure
to
be
here
somewhere
as
i
spoke
we
rounded
a
clump
of
laurels
to
see
the
lady
in
question
comfortably
ensconced
in
a
upon
the
lawn
by
her
side
was
jill
seated
upon
a
cushion
one
little
foot
tucked
under
her
nursing
the
other
instep
with
her
slim
brown
hand
on
a
rug
at
her
feet
lay
jonah
his
chin
propped
between
his
two
palms
and
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
all
three
were
gazing
contentedly
across
the
grass
to
where
the
drive
swept
wide
to
the
foot
of
the
broad
grey
steps
stood
a
handsome
the
facsimile
of
the
one
from
which
we
had
just
with
a
great
gasp
agatha
stopped
dead
and
i
recoiled
as
from
a
spectre
instinctively
we
clasped
one
another
it
all
right
i
whispered
i
seen
it
too
it
go
away
in
a
moment
shows
what
imagination
will
do
but
but
it
real
cried
agatha
real
enough
my
lady
said
jonah
voice
he
seemed
to
be
speaking
from
a
great
distance
and
i
bet
you
never
expected
to
see
her
again
so
soon
he
added
looking
at
me
with
a
smile
to
tell
you
the
truth
said
i
we
did
as
in
a
dream
i
watched
a
dazed
and
stammering
agatha
made
welcome
and
set
in
a
chair
by
my
sister
side
somebody
jill
i
fancy
led
me
to
the
rug
and
persuaded
me
to
sit
down
mechanically
i
started
to
fumble
for
a
cigarette
then
i
heard
jonah
talking
and
i
came
to
my
senses
we
thought
you
be
surprised
he
was
saying
but
i
did
think
take
you
like
this
after
all
there
nothing
uncanny
about
it
but
i
do
understand
listen
will
noggin
was
sitting
in
the
car
when
he
heard
a
crash
and
there
was
a
fellow
lying
in
the
middle
of
the
road
about
fifty
yards
away
with
a
beside
him
naturally
will
jumped
out
and
ran
to
his
help
the
man
seemed
to
be
having
a
fit
and
will
was
just
loosening
his
collar
when
he
heard
the
engine
start
and
saw
the
rolls
moving
he
left
the
chap
in
the
road
and
ran
like
mad
but
he
was
too
late
nobody
ever
saw
the
fellow
with
the
again
of
course
he
was
one
of
the
gang
and
his
fall
was
a
job
to
get
will
out
of
the
way
pretty
smart
what
well
you
had
been
gone
five
minutes
when
fitch
arrived
on
his
he
come
to
bring
us
a
can
of
petrol
for
after
we
left
he
remembered
the
tank
was
almost
empty
that
gave
me
a
bit
of
hope
if
they
stuck
to
the
main
road
you
were
pretty
well
bound
to
catch
them
for
fitch
swore
they
never
get
five
miles
but
of
course
they
might
turn
off
so
i
thought
the
rest
of
us
had
better
follow
and
search
the
for
all
we
were
worth
so
i
sat
on
fitch
carrier
with
the
can
under
one
arm
and
daphne
commandeered
the
curate
and
sent
berry
after
us
is
he
back
yet
said
i
looking
round
not
yet
said
jonah
with
a
grin
and
does
he
know
she
found
that
pleasure
is
still
awaiting
him
well
fitch
was
right
we
left
the
bloodstock
road
for
the
second
time
at
dew
thicket
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
she
was
dry
as
a
bone
but
as
right
as
rain
abandoned
apparently
any
way
there
was
no
one
in
sight
i
sent
fitch
after
you
and
drove
her
home
fitch
had
a
burst
directly
he
left
me
and
had
to
walk
back
to
bilberry
is
that
all
said
i
well
it
enough
is
it
not
nearly
said
i
rising
to
my
feet
kindly
accompany
me
to
the
stables
what
mean
boy
cried
jill
said
i
come
and
see
in
silence
i
led
the
way
agatha
treading
solemnly
by
my
side
as
we
turned
under
the
archway
that
led
to
the
you
see
i
said
carelessly
we
too
have
met
with
some
success
the
rolls
was
standing
where
i
had
left
her
waiting
to
be
backed
into
the
garage
my
sister
gave
a
cry
and
caught
at
jonah
arm
jonah
started
violently
and
smothered
an
exclamation
jill
put
one
hand
to
her
eyes
as
if
to
brush
away
a
vision
there
was
a
long
silence
at
length
i
turned
to
jonah
i
fear
that
you
were
hasty
brother
a
moment
reflection
will
show
you
that
you
and
fitch
have
spoiled
some
poor
day
let
me
suggest
that
you
return
your
gains
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
beyond
dew
thicket
without
delay
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
know
the
police
are
very
concerned
about
this
theft
it
was
the
fourth
in
this
district
this
morning
fitch
came
forward
touching
his
hat
it
a
mistake
anybody
might
make
sir
they
as
like
as
two
pins
he
pointed
to
the
car
she
the
spit
of
ours
she
is
do
be
silly
said
i
i
admit
they
exactly
alike
but
ours
fitch
shook
his
head
different
chassis
number
sir
to
say
nothing
of
the
i
stared
at
him
then
nonsense
i
said
sturdily
it
a
fact
sir
the
one
in
the
front
ours
i
afraid
you
stole
somebody
else
car
we
had
returned
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
were
wondering
what
to
do
when
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
sudden
outburst
of
cries
and
the
noise
of
a
car
tires
tearing
at
the
road
this
lay
but
a
hundred
odd
yards
away
on
the
farther
side
of
the
brown
stream
by
which
the
lawn
was
edged
for
the
length
of
a
cricket
pitch
the
hedgerow
bounding
the
highway
was
visible
from
where
we
stood
and
as
this
was
not
more
than
four
feet
high
we
were
able
to
observe
a
scene
which
was
clearly
but
the
prologue
to
a
drama
in
which
we
were
presently
to
appear
under
the
explosive
directions
of
a
man
in
a
grey
hat
who
was
standing
upright
and
holding
on
to
the
frantic
efforts
were
being
made
to
turn
what
seemed
to
be
a
small
touring
car
even
as
we
looked
a
savage
gesture
in
our
direction
suggested
that
our
friend
was
identifying
the
rolls
by
our
side
as
stolen
property
for
the
benefit
of
four
individuals
who
crouched
timorously
behind
him
to
my
consternation
i
observed
that
these
were
no
less
than
an
inspector
and
three
constables
of
the
county
police
the
next
minute
the
car
had
been
turned
round
and
was
being
driven
rapidly
back
to
our
leave
them
to
me
said
jonah
quietly
go
and
sit
down
on
the
lawn
all
of
you
i
fix
them
that
the
fellow
said
grey
hat
in
a
shaking
voice
and
that
his
accomplice
he
pointed
a
fat
hand
at
myself
and
agatha
in
turn
i
beg
your
pardon
said
jonah
grey
hat
turned
and
looked
him
up
and
down
were
you
wanting
anything
i
mean
i
live
here
i
do
know
who
you
are
came
the
reply
but
that
my
car
and
those
are
the
people
who
stole
it
one
thing
at
a
time
my
name
mansel
i
the
chief
constable
of
the
county
good
now
about
the
car
i
was
under
the
impression
that
it
was
mine
do
try
and
bluff
me
sir
roared
the
other
you
know
perfectly
well
that
that
car
was
stolen
from
the
outskirts
of
bloodstock
only
a
few
hours
ago
you
a
receiver
sir
a
common
he
checked
himself
with
an
effort
inspector
the
officer
addressed
came
forward
and
saluted
caution
the
three
of
them
had
you
better
identify
your
property
first
said
jonah
i
mean
i
do
want
to
interfere
but
if
it
a
question
of
our
arrest
the
inspector
hesitated
and
the
chief
constable
face
took
on
a
darker
shade
of
red
he
was
a
man
generously
designed
and
expensively
for
a
moment
i
thought
he
was
going
to
strike
jonah
then
he
caught
a
heavy
underlip
in
his
teeth
turned
on
his
heel
and
strode
to
the
he
cast
a
proprietor
eye
over
her
points
then
he
stepped
behind
her
as
though
to
come
to
her
other
side
the
next
second
he
was
back
and
shaking
his
fist
in
jonah
face
so
you
had
the
infernal
audacity
to
alter
the
have
you
he
yelled
thought
to
bluff
me
i
suppose
you
impudent
one
moment
said
jonah
steadily
without
looking
at
the
dash
tell
me
your
chassis
number
your
chauffeur
should
know
it
one
double
seven
eight
came
from
the
lips
of
the
gentleman
referred
to
thank
you
said
jonah
grey
hat
almost
ran
to
the
rolls
tore
open
the
bonnet
and
stared
at
the
dash
stared
we
waited
in
a
silence
so
charged
with
expectancy
as
to
be
almost
unbearable
at
last
the
chief
constable
straightened
his
back
his
eyes
were
bulging
and
his
face
redder
than
ever
twice
he
essayed
to
speak
without
success
then
i
said
it
was
my
car
said
jonah
placidly
for
a
moment
grey
hat
stood
glaring
at
him
then
muttering
something
about
a
mistake
he
started
to
lurch
towards
the
police
car
as
the
officers
turned
shamefacedly
to
follow
their
chief
jonah
parade
voice
rang
out
stop
at
the
word
of
command
master
and
men
alike
stood
still
where
they
were
my
friends
and
i
have
been
openly
accused
of
felony
and
threatened
with
arrest
the
chief
constable
swallowed
before
replying
i
was
mistaken
he
said
thickly
i
i
apologize
you
mean
to
say
you
believed
that
to
be
your
car
i
did
why
it
exactly
like
it
there
must
be
some
difference
there
no
difference
at
all
if
mine
were
here
i
defy
you
to
tell
them
apart
do
you
seriously
suggest
that
i
should
know
my
own
car
i
do
and
that
such
a
mistake
on
my
part
would
be
excusable
certainly
thank
you
said
jonah
that
excusable
mistake
was
made
this
morning
my
car
was
stolen
and
sought
for
your
car
was
found
if
you
will
accompany
me
to
the
stables
i
shall
be
happy
to
restore
it
to
you
at
once
grey
hat
started
forward
his
face
transfigured
with
excitement
and
relief
you
mean
to
say
he
began
come
sir
said
jonah
icily
i
feel
sure
that
the
ladies
will
excuse
your
withdrawal
it
was
half
an
hour
later
just
when
we
were
finishing
tea
that
a
cry
from
jill
made
us
all
turn
to
follow
her
gaze
down
the
curling
drive
twenty
paces
away
was
berry
plodding
slowly
in
our
direction
wheeling
a
bicycle
his
clothes
were
thick
with
dust
his
collar
was
like
a
piece
of
wet
rag
and
on
his
face
there
was
a
look
of
utter
and
profound
resignation
as
we
started
to
our
feet
do
touch
me
he
said
i
leading
in
the
marathon
race
the
conditions
are
fearful
competitors
are
required
not
only
to
walk
but
at
the
same
time
to
propel
a
bicycle
the
hind
tire
of
which
must
be
deflated
you
only
allowed
five
falls
and
i
used
four
of
them
with
a
final
effort
he
reached
the
edge
of
the
lawn
and
laid
the
bicycle
gently
on
its
side
we
brought
the
good
news
from
aix
to
ghent
he
continued
yes
i
see
the
car
but
i
not
interested
during
the
last
five
hours
my
life
has
been
so
crowded
with
incident
that
there
is
no
room
for
anything
else
is
there
a
cycling
club
about
here
i
can
join
i
always
fancied
a
grey
sweater
did
i
hear
you
say
that
you
had
fallen
brother
said
i
you
did
four
times
were
these
noble
limbs
prostrated
in
the
dust
the
first
time
was
when
the
came
off
oh
it
a
beautiful
machine
solemnly
he
waited
for
the
laughter
to
subside
but
she
does
turn
easily
if
my
blood
counts
there
are
at
least
three
corners
in
the
county
that
are
for
ever
england
and
now
will
somebody
fetch
the
vicar
i
sha
last
long
and
some
drinks
he
stretched
himself
upon
the
grass
several
drinks
all
together
in
a
large
vessel
jill
fled
weak
with
laughter
to
execute
his
commands
berry
proceeded
to
remove
his
collar
and
tie
i
ca
think
he
said
suddenly
why
they
call
them
safety
bicycles
i
suppose
it
because
they
strike
only
on
the
box
he
turned
to
daphne
since
i
left
you
this
morning
woman
i
have
walked
with
death
oh
more
than
once
of
course
i
walked
without
him
too
miles
and
miles
he
groaned
i
never
knew
there
was
so
much
road
did
you
do
any
riding
said
jonah
i
know
they
called
but
that
misleading
lots
of
people
ride
them
that
what
the
saddle
for
foul
drain
said
my
your
venomous
bile
pollutes
the
crystal
flood
of
my
narration
did
i
ride
that
was
the
undoing
of
the
sage
when
he
recovered
consciousness
for
the
second
time
it
was
to
discover
that
the
chain
was
missing
and
that
the
back
tire
was
windless
in
my
endeavours
to
find
the
chain
i
lost
myself
that
reminds
me
i
must
put
an
advertisement
in
to
the
effect
that
any
one
returning
a
to
white
ladies
will
be
assaulted
i
have
no
desire
to
be
reminded
of
if
anybody
had
told
me
you
could
cover
about
fifty
miles
of
open
road
in
england
without
meeting
anything
but
who
not
only
failed
to
stop
when
i
hailed
them
but
choked
and
blinded
me
with
their
filthy
dust
i
should
have
prayed
for
his
soul
and
not
a
pub
open
he
stopped
to
watch
with
a
glistening
eye
the
approach
of
jill
bearing
a
tankard
in
one
hand
and
a
large
jug
of
some
beverage
in
the
other
what
is
it
he
said
heaven
will
reward
you
darling
as
i
sha
he
took
a
long
draught
and
yet
i
do
know
i
got
an
old
pair
of
i
want
if
they
any
use
to
you
there
was
a
shriek
from
agatha
and
jill
is
anybody
going
to
church
said
daphne
consulting
her
berry
choked
gravely
i
regarded
him
run
along
and
change
said
i
and
you
can
return
the
curate
his
bicycle
at
the
same
time
besides
a
walk
do
you
good
do
tempt
me
he
replied
two
hours
ago
i
registered
a
vow
i
shall
drink
no
water
till
it
is
accomplished
let
hear
it
said
i
to
offer
no
violence
to
a
fool
for
six
months
said
berry
refilling
his
tankard
by
the
way
you
have
to
be
very
careful
when
you
take
off
my
boots
they
very
full
of
foot
this
evening
he
sank
back
and
closed
his
eyes
you
know
i
never
look
at
the
almanac
but
before
i
was
up
this
morning
i
knew
that
this
was
a
day
how
said
his
wife
i
left
a
stud
within
the
bath
and
heard
jonah
find
it
he
spread
out
a
dramatic
arm
and
he
thereon
did
only
sit
so
blind
he
could
see
and
then
the
yelled
and
swore
not
at
himself
but
me
chapter
ii
how
daphne
wrote
for
assistance
and
holly
was
outbid
blow
this
out
for
me
boy
there
a
dear
the
sun
was
streaming
into
the
library
in
a
cage
upon
the
broad
hearth
there
was
a
blazing
log
fire
and
the
appointment
of
the
was
good
to
look
upon
so
also
was
jill
installed
behind
the
cups
and
silver
my
cousin
made
a
sweet
picture
grave
eyes
set
wide
in
a
smiling
face
a
pile
of
golden
hair
crowning
her
pretty
head
the
slenderest
throat
from
which
the
collar
of
a
green
silk
coat
fell
gracefully
on
either
side
so
much
a
cunning
painter
might
have
charmed
faithfully
on
to
canvas
but
the
little
air
of
importance
of
dignity
that
sat
so
naively
upon
her
brow
this
was
a
thing
nor
brush
nor
pencil
could
capture
but
only
a
man
eye
writing
upon
a
grateful
heart
it
was
but
three
days
since
daphne
had
left
white
ladies
for
london
and
jill
reigned
in
her
stead
berry
had
accompanied
his
wife
but
jonah
and
i
had
stayed
in
the
country
with
jill
lest
we
should
lose
a
note
of
that
echo
of
summer
which
good
luke
had
this
year
piped
so
lustily
but
yesterday
the
strains
had
faltered
and
died
a
sour
east
wind
had
arisen
that
set
the
trees
shivering
and
whipped
the
golden
leaves
from
their
galleries
to
send
them
scudding
up
the
cold
grey
roads
worse
still
by
noon
the
sky
was
big
with
snow
so
that
before
the
post
office
was
closed
a
telegram
had
fled
to
london
warning
my
sister
to
expect
us
to
arrive
by
car
the
following
afternoon
jill
renewed
her
appeal
above
the
little
spirit
lamp
which
she
was
holding
hovered
a
tiny
flame
seemingly
so
sensitive
that
a
rough
word
would
quench
it
for
ever
when
i
had
kissed
my
cousin
i
blew
steadily
and
fiercely
from
the
instantly
a
large
tongue
of
fire
flared
to
where
jonah
was
eating
his
porridge
and
knitting
his
brows
over
jill
hand
began
to
shake
you
wicked
child
said
i
you
knew
oh
boy
but
it
so
silly
we
had
to
leave
it
for
you
jonah
nearly
burst
himself
just
now
trying
thing
bewitched
said
jonah
calmly
the
more
air
you
give
it
the
fiercer
it
burns
i
sooner
try
to
blow
out
a
hurricane
lamp
nonsense
said
i
taking
a
deep
breath
at
the
end
of
the
round
yes
said
jonah
do
you
mind
blowing
the
other
way
next
time
not
my
face
i
worrying
about
but
this
is
the
only
copy
of
in
the
house
jill
was
helpless
with
laughter
so
i
took
the
lamp
away
from
her
and
advanced
to
the
fireplace
i
fix
the
swine
i
said
savagely
two
minutes
later
with
a
blast
that
almost
blew
the
lamp
out
of
my
hand
the
flame
was
extinguished
in
a
flurry
that
would
have
done
credit
to
a
whale
as
i
straightened
my
back
well
done
boy
said
jill
there
a
letter
for
you
from
berry
do
see
what
he
says
then
i
read
you
daphne
read
hers
first
said
i
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
entered
this
room
to
eat
right
oh
and
in
her
fresh
little
voice
my
cousin
began
to
read
darling
sooner
you
all
come
up
the
better
everything
ready
and
more
than
i
can
manage
alone
his
shoulder
was
aching
last
night
but
when
i
wanted
to
rub
him
he
said
he
was
a
kind
of
aladdin
lamp
and
would
be
responsible
if
i
did
supposing
a
genie
appeared
and
formed
fours
or
the
rotted
aside
disclosing
a
flight
of
steps
result
in
bond
street
he
turned
suddenly
to
look
at
a
passing
car
and
had
a
seizure
he
just
gave
a
yell
as
if
he
been
shot
and
then
stood
stock
still
with
his
head
all
on
one
side
of
course
i
was
horrified
but
he
said
he
was
quite
all
right
and
explained
that
it
was
muscular
rheumatism
i
stopped
a
taxi
and
tried
to
make
him
get
in
for
people
were
beginning
to
look
do
you
think
he
would
not
a
bit
of
it
stood
there
and
said
it
was
a
judgment
and
that
he
must
stay
where
he
was
till
it
had
passed
that
may
not
be
for
years
they
put
railings
round
me
after
a
bit
and
people
will
meet
at
me
instead
of
the
tube
you
will
be
responsible
for
my
meals
some
of
which
you
will
cook
on
the
spot
i
have
a
light
lunch
about
hours
one
or
two
people
stopped
and
i
got
into
a
taxi
just
as
a
man
asked
him
if
he
was
brother
said
the
fool
my
blood
tests
are
more
than
satisfactory
a
malignant
fate
however
when
i
asked
him
if
he
was
coming
he
told
the
man
i
was
taunting
him
so
i
just
drove
home
the
willoughbys
brought
him
back
in
their
car
quarter
of
an
hour
later
madge
said
she
never
laughed
so
much
in
her
life
but
i
ca
bear
it
alone
mason
is
at
last
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
an
electric
cooker
and
your
new
curtains
look
sweet
come
along
love
to
you
berry
version
should
be
engaging
said
jonah
slip
along
with
that
porridge
do
hustle
me
gladstone
used
to
masticate
every
mouthful
he
took
seven
million
times
before
swallowing
that
why
he
could
tell
a
lie
or
am
i
thinking
of
lincoln
the
hostility
with
which
my
cousins
received
the
historical
allusion
was
so
marked
that
it
seemed
only
prudent
to
open
my
letter
without
further
delay
i
did
so
and
read
the
contents
aloud
brother
constant
derision
of
human
suffering
has
satisfied
me
that
the
facts
i
am
about
to
relate
will
afford
you
the
utmost
gratification
natheless
i
consider
that
for
form
sake
my
wife
brother
should
know
that
i
am
in
failing
health
this
morning
whilst
faring
forth
as
is
my
wont
pronounced
wunt
upon
a
mission
of
charity
i
was
seized
with
an
agony
in
the
neck
and
old
bond
street
just
opposite
the
believing
it
to
be
appendicitis
i
demanded
a
chirurgeon
but
nobody
could
spell
the
word
the
slightest
movement
however
spelt
anguish
without
a
mistake
my
scruff
was
in
the
grip
of
torment
observing
that
i
was
helpless
the
woman
my
wife
summoned
a
hackney
carriage
and
drove
off
taunting
and
jeering
at
her
spouse
by
this
time
my
screams
had
attracted
the
attention
of
a
few
some
stood
apparently
others
hurried
away
doubtless
to
procure
assistance
one
fool
asked
me
if
i
was
ill
i
told
him
that
i
had
been
dead
for
some
days
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
a
good
florist
as
i
wanted
them
to
send
no
flowers
had
it
not
been
for
madge
willoughby
i
should
have
been
there
bodies
of
navvies
are
slowly
but
surely
ruining
the
streets
no
efforts
are
made
to
stop
them
and
the
police
seem
powerless
to
is
no
room
in
london
i
never
remember
when
there
was
but
you
come
the
air
is
the
purer
for
your
absence
and
your
silk
hats
seem
to
fit
me
better
than
my
own
my
love
for
jill
is
only
exceeded
by
my
hatred
of
you
and
my
contempt
for
jonah
i
have
much
more
to
say
but
i
have
thank
heaven
something
better
to
do
than
to
communicate
with
a
debauched
connection
whose
pleasure
has
ever
been
my
pain
and
from
whom
i
have
learned
more
vicious
ways
than
i
can
remember
for
i
am
by
nature
a
little
child
just
before
and
after
rain
you
may
still
see
traces
of
the
halo
which
i
bought
at
eastbourne
in
my
gorge
is
rising
so
i
must
write
no
what
muscular
rheumatism
said
jill
gurgling
with
laughter
your
muscles
get
stiff
said
jonah
and
you
get
stuck
hurts
like
anything
i
had
it
now
you
know
said
i
selecting
a
sausage
will
you
be
ready
by
eleven
winter
time
or
must
we
lunch
here
i
ready
now
said
jill
but
you
and
jonah
said
it
was
indecent
to
start
earlier
so
it
is
we
shall
get
to
pistol
comfortably
in
an
hour
and
a
half
and
if
we
start
again
at
two
we
shall
be
in
london
for
tea
jonah
rose
and
limped
to
the
window
i
tell
you
one
thing
he
said
it
going
to
be
a
devilish
cold
run
jonah
was
right
we
sat
all
three
upon
the
front
seat
but
even
so
we
were
hard
put
to
it
to
keep
warm
the
prospect
of
a
hot
lunch
at
pistol
was
pleasant
indeed
jonah
was
driving
and
the
rolls
slid
through
the
country
like
a
great
grey
bird
sailing
and
swooping
and
swerving
so
gracefully
that
it
was
difficult
to
believe
the
tale
which
the
speedometer
told
yet
this
was
true
enough
for
it
was
not
a
quarter
to
one
when
we
swept
round
the
last
corner
and
into
the
long
straight
reach
of
tarmac
at
the
top
of
which
lay
the
village
we
sought
pistol
is
embedded
in
a
high
moor
snug
and
warm
for
all
its
eminence
the
moor
itself
is
girt
with
waving
woods
that
stretch
and
toss
for
miles
making
a
deep
sloping
sash
of
foliage
which
autumn
will
dye
with
such
grave
glory
that
the
late
loss
of
summer
and
her
pretty
ways
seems
easier
to
bear
orange
and
purple
copper
and
gold
russet
and
crimson
these
in
a
hundred
tones
tremble
and
glow
in
one
giant
harmony
out
of
which
at
the
release
of
sun
come
swelling
chords
so
deep
and
rich
and
vivid
that
the
sweet
air
is
quick
with
stifled
music
and
every
passing
breeze
charged
to
the
full
with
silent
melody
we
had
left
this
girdle
of
woodland
behind
us
and
were
within
half
a
mile
of
the
village
when
some
activity
about
the
gates
of
a
private
house
attracted
our
attention
a
little
knot
of
men
stood
arguing
in
the
roadway
three
cars
and
an
old
fly
were
berthed
close
to
the
hedge
while
a
landau
was
waiting
for
a
furniture
van
to
emerge
from
the
drive
the
next
moment
we
were
near
enough
to
learn
from
a
large
poster
that
the
entire
contents
of
cranmer
place
were
to
be
sold
by
auction
this
day
including
a
quantity
of
valuable
antique
furniture
and
with
one
accord
jill
and
i
called
upon
jonah
to
stop
what
for
said
the
latter
as
he
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
do
say
you
want
to
go
and
watch
the
rector
wife
bidding
against
her
conscience
and
the
draper
for
a
such
said
i
is
our
intention
i
hoisted
myself
to
my
feet
and
opening
the
door
descended
stiffly
into
the
road
as
i
helped
jill
to
follow
me
you
push
on
to
highlands
i
added
and
order
the
lunch
we
only
stay
a
minute
or
two
and
you
never
know
said
jill
we
might
see
something
priceless
jonah
shook
his
head
depend
upon
it
he
said
the
oleographs
have
gone
to
christie
same
as
the
fumed
oak
only
the
dud
stuff
left
however
have
it
your
own
way
with
a
sigh
he
let
in
the
clutch
if
you
not
there
by
a
quarter
past
one
i
shall
begin
jill
slid
an
arm
through
mine
which
she
squeezed
excitedly
i
sure
we
shall
find
something
boy
i
just
feel
it
it
always
happens
like
this
you
see
it
is
as
if
we
were
looking
for
a
sale
we
just
run
right
into
one
and
last
night
i
dreamed
about
cretonnes
that
settles
it
said
i
as
the
rolls
glided
out
of
our
way
and
we
started
to
cross
the
road
all
the
same
jonah
probably
right
but
i
love
a
sale
i
afraid
it
curiosity
more
than
anything
catalogues
were
handed
us
at
the
front
door
and
we
passed
into
a
fine
square
hall
where
a
dresser
and
a
large
each
conspicuously
labelled
declared
that
the
late
occupant
was
a
man
of
taste
two
very
fine
pieces
sir
said
a
voice
coming
up
this
afternoon
i
turned
to
see
a
short
stout
man
in
a
bowler
and
two
overcoats
which
he
wore
open
regarding
the
furniture
with
an
appraising
look
with
difficulty
he
extracted
a
card
from
an
inside
pocket
if
thinkin
of
buyin
anythin
major
that
me
card
an
i
be
very
to
ac
for
you
thanks
i
do
think
all
right
major
all
right
only
if
you
should
i
always
about
he
added
hastily
turning
away
in
response
to
a
cry
which
had
arisen
for
mr
comin
comin
he
cried
making
for
what
i
took
to
be
the
drawing
room
i
slipped
his
card
into
my
pocket
and
we
passed
on
the
tallboy
chest
was
standing
alone
in
its
dignity
at
the
top
of
the
broad
staircase
the
moment
i
saw
it
i
knew
it
was
good
stuff
and
jill
gave
a
little
cry
and
began
to
chatter
till
i
laid
my
hand
on
her
arm
with
a
warning
pressure
hush
i
said
quickly
do
give
it
away
of
course
they
all
know
it
good
but
we
need
seem
try
and
look
as
if
you
thought
it
might
do
for
the
if
it
was
enamelled
boy
such
chests
may
be
handsome
and
rarely
elegant
but
this
was
dainty
standing
upon
short
cabriole
legs
it
was
small
but
of
exquisite
proportions
and
had
been
built
i
judged
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
the
walnut
which
had
gone
to
its
making
was
picked
wood
and
its
drawers
were
faced
with
and
inlaid
with
box
their
handles
were
perfect
and
indeed
the
whole
chest
was
untouched
and
without
blemish
shining
with
that
clean
lustre
which
only
wax
and
constant
can
bring
about
when
i
had
examined
the
piece
as
carefully
as
i
dared
i
winked
at
jill
and
descended
into
the
hall
holly
was
awaiting
us
casually
i
addressed
him
there
a
tallboy
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
labelled
i
not
crazy
about
it
but
it
about
the
right
size
for
a
recess
in
my
bedroom
if
you
like
to
buy
that
for
me
on
a
five
per
cent
basis
certainly
major
he
wrote
in
a
fat
notebook
lot
an
ow
will
you
go
i
hesitated
i
go
up
to
a
hundred
pounds
but
the
cheaper
you
get
it
the
better
for
you
understand
i
there
major
will
you
be
coming
back
no
but
there
my
card
you
can
telegraph
to
that
address
this
evening
and
i
send
you
a
cheque
very
good
sir
a
minute
later
we
were
walking
along
the
road
towards
highlands
and
while
jill
was
talking
excitedly
i
was
considering
my
own
recklessness
as
we
entered
the
grounds
do
say
anything
about
it
i
said
let
it
be
a
surprise
the
first
person
i
saw
as
i
entered
the
lounge
of
that
hotel
was
berry
do
you
mind
not
asking
me
why
i
here
he
said
languidly
i
just
finished
telling
jonah
and
repetition
always
wearied
me
your
movements
have
never
interested
me
said
i
all
the
same
i
thought
you
were
in
the
grip
of
torment
i
was
and
shall
be
for
the
nonce
he
turned
to
a
tall
dark
girl
who
was
leaning
against
the
watching
us
curiously
let
me
introduce
my
carefully
kept
from
me
before
marriage
and
by
me
ever
since
both
the
ablative
case
i
believe
but
what
a
difference
so
rich
is
the
english
tongue
the
girl
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
i
observed
that
she
had
nice
teeth
name
of
childe
she
said
in
a
sweet
voice
after
all
we
ca
expect
him
to
remember
everything
was
my
brother
in
your
regiment
i
knew
i
seen
you
somewhere
said
i
the
last
time
you
were
on
a
towel
leaning
against
a
bottle
of
hairwash
that
was
in
flanders
in
that
said
berry
will
do
miss
childe
and
i
came
here
to
lunch
not
to
listen
to
maudlin
memories
of
the
great
war
did
i
ever
tell
you
that
a
spaniard
once
compared
me
to
that
elusive
bloom
to
be
found
only
upon
the
ungathered
apricot
how
much
did
you
lend
him
said
i
perhaps
he
knew
more
about
ferns
said
miss
childe
blind
from
birth
i
suppose
said
jonah
voice
my
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
about
him
with
the
expression
of
one
who
has
detected
an
offensive
odour
he
was
a
man
of
singular
insight
and
fine
feeling
he
said
at
the
time
of
his
outburst
i
was
giving
evidence
against
him
for
cruelty
to
a
bullock
and
now
for
goodness
sake
somebody
collect
jill
and
have
some
lunch
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
miss
childe
i
come
down
to
get
some
butter
and
eggs
they
usually
sent
but
the
housekeeper
ill
and
as
i
was
going
spare
father
suggested
i
should
run
down
and
pick
them
up
her
voice
sounded
as
if
she
was
speaking
from
afar
and
i
knew
that
i
must
call
up
all
my
reserves
of
willpower
if
i
was
to
remain
awake
but
berry
with
you
is
he
yes
your
sister
came
to
lunch
yesterday
and
happened
to
mention
that
he
wanted
to
go
to
pistol
so
i
offered
him
a
lift
he
much
nicer
than
any
chauffeur
but
whatever
did
he
want
to
come
to
pistol
for
ah
from
a
great
distance
i
watched
miss
childe
brown
eyes
take
on
a
look
of
mischief
that
seemed
at
home
in
its
bright
setting
he
tell
you
and
he
did
tell
captain
mansel
the
truth
so
i
sha
give
him
away
she
looked
at
a
tiny
and
now
i
must
be
going
we
want
to
start
back
at
three
and
i
miles
to
do
before
then
may
i
come
with
you
certainly
but
i
stepped
to
where
jill
was
scribbling
a
note
we
need
start
before
three
i
said
will
you
wait
for
me
she
nodded
abstractedly
jonah
was
dozing
over
a
cigarette
berry
had
disappeared
three
minutes
later
i
was
sitting
in
a
comfortable
coupé
which
miss
childe
was
driving
at
an
unlawful
speed
in
the
direction
of
colt
you
drive
a
lot
do
you
flashed
my
companion
a
good
deal
then
i
expect
you
hate
being
driven
by
a
stranger
not
at
all
sometimes
of
course
i
waited
for
us
to
emerge
from
between
two
and
a
as
we
were
doing
over
the
pause
was
but
momentary
i
mean
that
you
being
frightened
to
death
not
to
death
i
still
got
some
feeling
in
my
right
arm
we
dropped
down
one
of
the
steepest
hills
i
have
ever
seen
with
two
bends
in
it
at
an
increased
speed
you
keep
your
guardian
angel
pretty
busy
you
a
suspicion
of
a
smile
played
for
a
second
about
my
lady
lips
the
only
thing
i
really
frightened
of
is
a
hansom
cab
she
affirmed
try
and
imagine
that
there
are
half
a
dozen
round
the
next
corner
will
you
the
smile
deepened
is
your
heart
all
right
she
demanded
it
was
when
we
started
but
i
know
this
road
backwards
you
need
tell
me
that
said
i
we
should
have
been
killed
long
ago
if
you
did
seriously
i
do
want
to
abuse
your
hospitality
but
we
going
to
have
kidneys
for
breakfast
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
miss
them
are
you
fond
of
kidneys
passionately
i
used
to
go
out
and
gather
them
as
a
child
in
the
morning
and
the
meadows
or
were
we
talking
of
haddock
miss
childe
hesitated
before
replying
i
used
to
too
but
i
was
always
afraid
of
their
being
toadstools
they
poisonous
are
they
deadly
by
the
way
there
are
six
hansoms
full
of
toadstools
at
the
which
i
observe
we
are
approaching
i
do
believe
you
i
was
wrong
but
there
was
a
waggon
full
of
logs
and
a
limousine
full
of
children
which
were
rather
worse
we
proceeded
amid
faint
cries
of
indignation
what
do
you
do
said
i
when
you
come
to
a
with
the
gates
shut
i
do
said
miss
childe
i
was
still
working
this
out
when
my
companion
slowed
down
and
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
in
front
of
a
high
white
gate
bearing
the
legend
private
and
keeping
a
thin
brown
road
that
ran
for
a
little
way
between
fair
meadows
before
plunging
into
a
swaying
beechwood
anything
the
matter
i
asked
miss
childe
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
be
an
angel
she
said
in
a
caressing
voice
certainly
said
i
with
or
without
wings
and
open
the
gate
so
that
i
know
i
cried
i
know
do
tell
me
that
the
automobile
may
pass
unobstructed
between
the
am
i
right
how
on
earth
did
you
know
instinct
i
open
the
door
and
stepped
backwards
into
the
road
always
like
this
before
eating
kidneys
i
added
as
i
the
car
now
we
can
let
her
out
said
miss
childe
contentedly
it
such
a
relief
to
feel
there
no
speed
limit
she
added
with
a
ravishing
smile
as
soon
as
i
could
trust
my
voice
i
should
think
your
chauffeurs
live
very
long
do
they
on
the
contrary
they
grow
old
in
our
service
i
can
believe
you
said
i
heartily
i
myself
have
aged
considerably
since
we
left
highlands
by
this
time
we
had
flung
through
and
out
of
the
beechwood
and
the
car
was
storming
past
stretches
of
gleaming
bracken
all
red
and
gold
and
stuck
with
spreading
oak
trees
that
stood
sometimes
alone
sometimes
in
groups
of
two
or
three
together
and
made
you
think
of
staring
cattle
standing
in
a
golden
flood
the
car
tore
on
we
coming
to
where
i
used
to
gather
the
mushrooms
my
companion
announced
barefoot
sometimes
because
of
the
dew
she
nodded
i
sighed
then
up
to
now
i
been
feeling
like
a
large
brandy
and
a
small
soda
i
said
now
i
feel
like
a
sonnet
what
is
your
name
and
who
gave
you
that
name
i
sure
that
not
necessary
i
seen
a
sonnet
a
lady
upon
her
birthday
as
you
please
shall
i
post
it
to
you
or
pin
it
to
a
tree
in
battersea
park
miss
childe
nodded
her
head
in
the
direction
in
which
we
were
going
that
she
said
is
the
house
at
the
end
of
a
long
avenue
of
elms
i
could
see
the
bold
flash
of
windows
which
the
afternoon
sun
had
set
afire
and
a
moment
later
we
swept
by
the
front
of
an
old
red
mansion
and
round
into
a
paved
court
that
lay
on
its
farther
side
here
was
a
door
open
and
in
front
of
this
my
companion
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
i
handed
her
out
she
rang
the
bell
and
entered
i
followed
her
in
like
to
look
round
the
house
said
miss
childe
we
given
up
showing
it
since
the
suffragettes
but
if
you
could
give
me
a
reference
salmon
and
gluckstein
said
i
are
my
solicitors
my
lady
pointed
to
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
flagged
passage
in
which
we
stood
that
take
you
into
the
hall
she
said
i
come
and
find
you
when
i
seen
the
servants
i
saluted
and
broke
away
in
the
direction
she
had
indicated
there
was
a
closet
that
opened
out
of
the
great
gallery
no
door
hung
in
the
doorway
and
i
could
see
china
ranged
orderly
against
the
panelling
of
the
walls
i
descended
its
two
stairs
expecting
to
find
it
devoted
to
china
and
nothing
else
but
i
was
wrong
facing
the
window
and
the
sunshine
was
a
facsimile
of
the
tallboy
chest
which
i
had
coveted
so
fiercely
two
hours
before
i
gazed
at
it
it
very
rude
to
stare
said
a
voice
i
turned
to
see
miss
childe
framed
in
the
doorway
her
gown
was
of
apricot
with
the
bodice
cut
low
and
the
skirt
gathered
in
loops
to
show
her
white
silk
petticoat
which
swelled
from
under
a
flowered
stomacher
so
monstrously
that
the
tiny
slipper
upon
the
second
stair
seemed
smaller
than
ever
deep
frills
of
lace
fell
from
her
short
sleeves
and
a
little
lace
cap
was
set
on
her
thick
dark
hair
i
swallowed
before
replying
then
it
a
lovely
chest
i
said
lamely
picked
wood
said
miss
childe
flogged
once
a
week
for
years
that
tree
was
flogged
certainly
suddenly
the
air
was
full
of
music
and
a
jubilant
chorus
of
voices
was
singing
lustily
woman
a
spaniel
and
a
the
more
you
beat
them
the
better
they
as
the
melody
faded
i
told
you
so
said
miss
childe
what
about
the
butter
and
eggs
will
you
pay
for
them
or
shall
i
have
them
sent
i
handed
her
the
largest
one
pound
note
i
have
ever
seen
thanks
she
said
shortly
change
at
earl
court
a
peal
of
boy
laughter
floated
in
at
the
open
window
who
that
said
i
love
said
miss
childe
the
locksmiths
are
here
and
he
laughing
at
them
i
think
it
rather
unkind
myself
besides
a
burst
of
fire
interrupted
her
as
the
echoes
died
down
you
smell
of
potpourri
said
i
probably
i
made
three
bags
full
this
morning
bead
bags
do
you
mind
putting
some
coal
on
the
fire
if
there
are
any
tongs
use
the
telephone
there
was
no
fireplace
and
no
so
i
took
off
my
right
boot
and
put
it
in
the
bottom
drawer
of
the
tallboy
instead
number
please
said
miss
childe
who
had
entered
the
closet
and
was
standing
before
a
mirror
to
adjust
a
patch
beneath
her
left
eye
lot
said
i
line
engaged
said
miss
childe
did
you
see
it
in
by
way
of
answer
i
threw
a
large
plate
at
her
she
seemed
more
pleased
than
otherwise
with
the
attention
and
began
to
pluck
the
delicate
flowers
with
which
it
was
painted
and
gather
them
into
a
nosegay
in
some
dudgeon
i
blew
a
small
jug
of
great
beauty
on
to
a
carved
to
which
it
adhered
as
though
made
of
some
slimy
substance
cannon
said
my
lady
shall
i
put
you
on
i
wish
you
would
it
rather
important
you
through
tallboy
speaking
said
a
faint
voice
tallboy
tallboy
how
d
do
said
i
ill
said
the
voice
so
all
these
years
i
carried
it
and
no
one
knew
pardon
me
said
i
i
only
put
it
there
five
minutes
ago
you
see
the
fire
was
almost
out
and
measurements
tell
said
the
voice
but
they
never
do
that
they
polish
my
panels
and
lay
fair
linen
within
me
and
great
folk
have
stood
about
me
telling
each
other
of
my
elegance
and
once
a
baby
child
mirrored
its
little
face
in
one
of
my
sides
and
all
the
time
measurements
tell
but
they
never
do
that
a
sigh
floated
to
my
ears
a
long
long
sigh
that
rose
into
a
wail
of
the
wind
and
a
casement
behind
me
blew
to
with
a
shaking
clash
somewhere
a
dog
was
howling
on
a
sudden
i
felt
cold
the
sunshine
was
gone
and
the
chamber
had
become
grey
and
dismal
misery
was
in
the
air
a
stifled
exclamation
made
me
look
round
my
lady
had
backed
shrinking
into
a
corner
one
little
hand
pressed
to
her
heart
and
in
her
hunted
eyes
sat
fear
dominant
the
sweet
face
was
drawn
and
colourless
and
her
breath
came
quickly
so
that
it
was
grievous
to
mark
the
flutter
of
her
smooth
white
chest
mechanically
i
turned
to
seek
the
cause
of
her
terror
i
saw
a
man
standing
square
in
the
closet
doorway
his
face
was
coarse
and
red
and
brutal
and
his
small
black
eyes
glowed
with
an
ugly
twinkle
as
he
surveyed
his
quarry
upon
the
thick
lips
there
was
a
sinister
smile
which
broadened
hideously
as
he
glanced
at
the
nosegay
held
betwixt
his
finger
and
thumb
the
little
nosegay
that
she
had
gathered
so
lightly
from
the
painted
plate
a
coat
of
red
fell
nearly
to
his
knees
and
hid
his
breeches
his
short
black
periwig
was
bobbed
and
a
black
silk
tie
was
knotted
about
his
neck
stockings
were
rolled
above
his
knees
and
a
huge
tongue
thrust
out
from
each
of
his
buckled
shoes
and
in
his
left
hand
was
a
heavy
whose
handle
was
wrought
about
with
gold
this
he
kept
clapping
against
his
leg
with
a
smack
and
a
ghastly
relish
that
there
was
no
mistaking
again
that
phantom
chorus
rose
up
and
rang
in
my
ears
woman
a
spaniel
and
a
walnut
tree
the
more
you
beat
them
the
better
they
but
the
jubilant
note
was
gone
and
though
the
tune
was
the
same
the
voices
were
harsh
and
there
was
a
dreadful
mockery
of
woe
in
the
stave
that
made
me
shudder
my
lady
heard
it
too
no
no
ralph
you
do
me
wrong
i
plucked
them
myself
who
is
there
now
to
send
me
posies
and
i
am
sick
you
know
it
the
last
time
the
hurrying
voice
faltered
and
stumbled
piteously
over
a
sob
the
last
time
i
was
near
spent
ralph
so
near
and
now
you
do
not
know
your
strength
indeed
oh
ralph
ralph
what
have
i
done
that
you
should
use
me
so
the
bitter
cry
sank
into
a
dull
moan
and
setting
a
frail
white
arm
across
her
eyes
she
bowed
her
head
upon
it
as
do
weeping
children
and
fell
to
sobbing
with
that
subdued
despair
that
spells
a
broken
spirit
my
lord
withers
were
unwrung
for
a
moment
he
stood
still
leering
like
some
foul
thing
that
feasts
on
anguish
then
he
let
fall
the
nosegay
and
took
the
whip
in
his
right
hand
and
i
stood
there
frozen
and
paralysed
and
dumb
posing
his
victim
with
a
horrible
precision
the
monster
raised
his
whip
but
it
struck
a
pendant
lantern
and
with
an
oath
he
turned
to
the
gallery
where
he
should
find
room
and
to
spare
for
his
brutality
at
this
delay
my
lady
fell
upon
her
knees
in
a
wild
hope
i
think
to
turn
her
respite
into
a
reprieve
but
the
beast
cried
out
upon
her
struck
down
her
outstretched
hands
and
twisting
his
fingers
in
her
soft
dark
hair
dragged
her
incontinently
out
of
the
closet
the
little
whimper
she
gave
was
awful
and
i
stood
there
paralysed
five
minutes
perhaps
had
passed
pregnant
minutes
when
my
lord
reappeared
he
stood
for
a
moment
listening
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
his
chin
on
his
shoulder
then
he
stepped
lightly
down
his
vile
face
was
pale
and
his
eyes
shifted
uneasily
the
devil
looked
out
of
them
yet
but
fright
looked
with
him
two
paces
brought
the
fellow
before
the
tallboy
he
put
up
his
hands
as
if
to
pull
open
a
drawer
when
something
about
the
whip
he
was
holding
caught
his
attention
for
a
second
he
stared
at
it
muttering
then
with
a
glance
at
the
doorway
he
thrust
the
thing
beneath
the
skirt
of
his
coat
and
wiped
it
as
it
had
been
a
rapier
again
he
made
to
open
a
drawer
but
the
spell
under
which
i
lay
seemed
to
be
lifted
and
i
shot
out
a
hand
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
for
all
the
notice
he
took
i
might
not
have
been
there
the
more
incensed
i
shook
the
man
violently
repose
said
jonah
is
one
thing
gluttonish
sloth
another
and
even
if
you
have
once
again
overestimated
the
capacity
of
your
stomach
why
advertise
your
intemperance
in
a
public
place
he
lifted
his
hand
from
my
shoulder
to
look
at
his
watch
it
now
ten
minutes
to
three
do
you
think
you
can
stagger
or
must
you
be
carried
to
the
car
i
sat
up
and
looked
about
me
except
for
jill
who
was
standing
before
a
mirror
we
were
alone
in
the
lounge
i
been
dreaming
said
i
about
about
that
all
right
old
chap
tell
nanny
all
about
it
after
you
had
your
bath
that
one
of
the
things
she
paid
for
do
be
a
fool
said
i
putting
a
hand
to
my
head
it
important
i
tell
you
for
heaven
sake
let
me
think
oh
what
was
it
my
cousins
stared
at
me
i
not
rotting
it
was
real
something
that
mattered
race
said
jonah
eagerly
green
hoops
leading
by
twelve
lengths
or
something
i
waved
him
away
no
no
no
let
me
think
let
me
think
i
buried
my
face
in
my
hands
and
thought
and
thought
but
to
no
purpose
the
vision
was
gone
hastily
i
made
ready
for
our
journey
to
town
all
the
time
racking
my
brain
feverishly
for
some
odd
atom
of
incident
that
should
remember
my
dream
it
was
not
until
i
was
actually
seated
in
the
rolls
with
my
foot
upon
the
that
i
thought
about
berry
casually
i
asked
what
had
become
of
him
that
what
we
want
to
know
said
jill
he
motored
down
here
with
miss
childe
and
now
they
pushed
off
somewhere
but
they
say
childe
i
shouted
miss
childe
i
got
it
what
on
earth
the
matter
said
jonah
as
i
started
the
car
my
dream
i
cried
i
remember
it
all
it
was
about
that
tallboy
what
the
one
we
saw
cried
jill
i
nodded
i
going
to
double
my
bid
i
said
we
simply
must
have
it
whatever
the
price
disregarding
jonah
protests
that
we
were
going
the
wrong
way
i
swung
the
car
in
the
direction
from
which
we
had
come
and
streaked
down
the
road
to
cranmer
place
a
minute
later
i
dashed
into
the
hall
with
jill
at
my
heels
the
first
person
i
saw
was
holly

it
come
up

i
flung
the
words
at
him

the
winds

said
i
i
afraid

tell
you

with
an
effort
i
mastered
my
impatience

or
if
he
gone

out
i
do
think
gorn
said
holly
looking
round
i
think
there
is
he
cried
suddenly
nodding
over
my
shoulder
that
on
the
stairs
with
the
lady
in
blue
excitedly
i
swung
round
to
see
my
languidly
descending
the
staircase
with
miss
childe
by
his
side
hullo
he
said
do
you
mind
not
asking
me
why
i
here
it
not
my
practice
said
i
to
ask
a
question
the
answer
to
which
i
already
know
i
turned
to
holly
and
took
out
a
one
pound
note
i
much
obliged
for
your
trouble
a
bid
after
pounds
i
think
you
said
i
handed
him
the
note
which
he
accepted
with
protests
of
gratitude
you
did
better
than
you
know
i
added
may
i
ask
said
berry
unsteadily
if
this
gentleman
and
you
are
in
collusion
we
were
said
i
at
least
i
instructed
him
to
purchase
some
furniture
for
me
unfortunately
we
were
outbid
but
it
of
no
consequence
berry
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
subtraction
he
said
is
not
my
strongest
point
but
i
make
it
eighty
pounds
is
that
right
i
nodded
and
he
turned
to
miss
childe
that
viper
he
said
has
stung
the
fool
who
feeds
him
to
the
tune
of
eighty
pounds
shall
i
faint
here
or
by
the
let
be
clear
about
it
the
moment
i
enter
the
swoon
still
as
long
as
it
in
the
family
began
jill
exactly
said
i
the
main
thing
is
we
got
it
and
when
heard
my
tale
eighty
paper
pounds
said
berry
can
you
beat
it
that
only
be
about
before
the
war
said
miss
childe
in
a
shaking
voice
yes
said
i
look
at
it
that
way
and
what
a
bagatelle
brother
a
bagatelle
now
if
we
were
in
russia
yes
said
berry
grimly
and
if
we
were
in
patagonia
i
suppose
i
should
be
up
on
the
deal
you
can
cut
that
bit
miss
childe
and
jill
dissolved
into
peals
of
merriment
that
right
said
berry
deride
the
destitute
mock
at
bereavement
as
for
you
he
added
turning
to
jill
your
visit
to
the
zoo
is
indefinitely
postponed
other
children
shall
feel
sick
in
the
and
be
taken
to
smell
the
bears
but
you
never
he
turned
to
miss
childe
and
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
shut
your
eyes
my
dear
and
repeat
one
of
alfred
austin
odes
this
place
is
full
of
the
ungodly
my
determination
to
carry
the
tallboy
chest
to
london
in
the
rolls
met
with
stern
opposition
but
in
the
end
i
prevailed
and
at
six
that
evening
it
was
safely
housed
in
mayfair
to
do
him
justice
berry
annoyance
was
considerably
tempered
by
the
strange
story
which
i
unfolded
during
a
belated
tea
the
house
and
park
which
i
had
seen
we
were
unable
to
identify
and
the
post
office
guide
was
silent
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
colt
but
the
excitement
which
daphne
production
of
a
aroused
was
only
exceeded
by
the
depression
which
was
created
by
our
failure
to
discover
anything
unusual
about
the
chest
we
measured
the
cornice
and
we
measured
the
plinth
we
measured
the
frame
and
we
measured
the
drawers
but
if
the
linear
measurements
afforded
us
little
satisfaction
the
square
measurements
revealed
considerably
less
while
since
no
one
of
us
was
a
mathematician
the
calculation
of
the
cubic
capacity
proved
not
only
unprofitable
but
provocative
of
such
bitter
arguments
and
insulting
remarks
that
daphne
demanded
that
we
should
desist
all
right
said
berry
if
you
do
believe
me
call
in
a
consulting
engineer
i
worked
the
blinking
thing
out
three
times
i
admit
the
answers
were
entirely
different
but
that
not
my
fault
i
never
did
like
astrology
i
tell
you
the
beastly
chest
holds
thousand
point
nine
double
eight
recurring
cubic
inches
of
air
some
other
fool
can
reduce
that
to
rods
and
there
you
are
i
fed
up
with
it
thanks
to
the
machinations
of
that
congenital
idiot
with
the
imitation
mustachios
i
paid
more
than
four
times
its
value
and
i
not
going
to
burst
my
brains
trying
to
work
out
which
drawer
would
have
had
a
false
bottom
if
it
had
been
built
by
a
dipsomaniac
who
kept
fowls
and
that
that
tearfully
miss
childe
announced
that
it
was
time
for
her
to
be
going
and
i
elected
to
escort
her
as
far
as
the
garage
as
we
stepped
on
to
the
pavement
i
know
a
lot
more
about
you
than
you
think
said
i
i
never
told
you
half
what
i
dreamed
what
do
you
know
oh
nothing
momentous
just
the
more
intimate
details
of
your
everyday
life
your
partiality
to
mushrooms
your
recognition
of
love
your
recklessness
pretty
peculiarities
of
your
toilet
good
heavens
cried
miss
childe
but
you
would
tell
me
your
name
false
modesty
seriously
you
do
mean
to
say
but
i
do
nothing
was
hid
from
me
your
little
bare
feet
a
stifled
scream
interrupted
me
this
said
miss
childe
is
awful
we
turned
into
the
mews
what
are
you
doing
dictating
you
see
there
a
dream
i
want
recorded
i
shall
expect
you
at
one
we
can
start
after
lunch
i
a
beautiful
hand
i
know
you
have
two
of
them
they
were
bare
too
i
added
reflectively
with
a
choking
sound
miss
childe
got
into
the
car
one
she
said
as
she
slid
into
the
driver
seat
without
fail
i
raised
my
hat
by
the
way
who
shall
i
ask
for
miss
childe
flung
me
a
dazzling
smile
i
no
sisters
she
said
moodily
i
returned
to
the
house
i
entered
the
library
to
find
that
the
others
had
retired
presumably
to
dress
for
dinner
mechanically
i
crossed
to
the
tallboy
which
we
had
so
fruitlessly
surveyed
and
began
to
finger
it
idly
wondering
all
the
time
whether
my
dream
was
wanton
or
whether
there
was
indeed
some
secret
which
we
might
discover
it
did
not
seem
possible
and
yet
that
distant
voice
rang
in
my
ears
measurements
tell
measurements
tell
but
they
never
do
that
a
sudden
idea
came
to
me
and
i
drew
out
the
second
long
drawer
then
in
some
excitement
i
withdrew
the
first
and
placed
it
exactly
upon
the
top
of
the
second
so
that
i
might
see
if
they
were
of
the
same
size
second
was
the
deeper
by
an
inch
and
a
i
thrust
my
arms
into
the
empty
frame
feeling
feverishly
for
a
bolt
or
catch
which
should
be
holding
a
panel
in
place
at
the
back
of
where
the
first
drawer
had
lain
at
first
i
could
find
nothing
then
my
right
hand
encountered
a
round
hole
in
the
wood
just
large
enough
to
admit
a
finger
almost
immediately
i
came
upon
a
similar
hole
on
the
side
their
office
was
plain
a
moment
later
and
i
had
drawn
the
panel
out
of
its
standing
and
clear
of
the
chest
my
hands
were
trembling
as
i
thrust
them
into
the
dusty
hullo
are
you
going
to
dress
said
jonah
some
two
minutes
later
but
i
was
still
staring
at
a
heavy
whose
handle
was
wrought
about
with
gold
chapter
iii
how
a
man
may
follow
his
own
hat
and
berry
took
a
lamp
in
his
hand
what
are
you
doing
this
morning
said
daphne
berry
turned
to
the
mantelpiece
and
selected
a
pipe
before
replying
i
have
he
said
several
duties
to
discharge
all
curiously
enough
to
myself
first
if
not
foremost
i
must
hire
some
secondly
i
must
select
some
socks
for
the
to
suspend
is
that
clear
neither
last
nor
least
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
his
wife
you
going
to
help
me
choose
a
present
for
maisie
dukedom
besides
i
got
to
go
to
fortnum
and
mason
and
i
want
you
to
carry
the
i
know
and
we
can
get
the
chops
at
the
same
time
we
better
take
some
newspaper
with
us
and
a
perambulator
tell
you
what
said
jonah
let
all
join
together
and
give
her
a
persian
rug
that
rather
an
idea
said
my
sister
and
they
wear
for
ever
you
sure
of
that
are
you
said
berry
i
mean
i
should
like
her
to
have
to
get
a
new
one
in
about
six
hundred
years
i
like
a
present
to
last
before
daphne
could
reply
how
spell
said
jill
looking
up
from
a
letter
personally
said
i
i
do
it
one
of
the
words
i
avoid
if
you
must
i
should
write
it
down
both
ways
and
see
what
it
looks
like
the
telephone
bell
began
to
ring
wrong
number
for
a
fiver
said
jonah
they
always
do
it
about
this
time
berry
crossed
the
room
and
picked
up
the
receiver
we
listened
expectantly
have
i
got
a
taxi
my
dear
fellow
i
got
a
whole
school
of
them
would
you
like
a
renault
or
a
baby
grand
what
oh
i
afraid
i
could
send
it
at
once
you
see
i
only
got
one
boy
and
having
his
hair
cut
i
can
post
it
to
you
and
i
should
think
you
get
it
morning
no
i
not
mad
no
i
not
the
either
well
you
should
have
asked
me
never
mind
let
talk
of
something
else
i
wonder
if
you
interested
in
i
beg
your
pardon
gravely
he
restored
the
receiver
to
its
perch
not
interested
he
added
for
our
information
he
did
actually
say
so
but
from
the
directions
he
gave
concerning
them
happily
i
may
say
quite
impracticable
talking
of
telephoning
said
jonah
uncertainly
do
forget
got
to
ring
up
and
say
whether
we
want
those
tickets
so
we
have
said
my
sister
wednesday
week
is
it
let
see
she
fell
to
examining
a
tiny
murmuring
to
herself
as
she
deciphered
or
interpreted
the
entries
i
continued
to
survey
the
street
it
was
a
dark
morning
in
december
and
we
were
all
in
the
library
where
there
was
a
good
fire
warming
ourselves
preparatory
to
venturing
abroad
and
facing
the
wind
which
was
making
london
so
unpleasant
the
tickets
to
which
jonah
referred
would
make
us
free
of
the
albert
hall
for
a
ball
which
promised
to
surpass
all
its
predecessors
in
splendour
and
discomfort
no
one
was
to
be
admitted
who
was
not
clad
in
cloth
either
of
gold
or
silver
and
while
there
were
to
be
no
intervals
between
the
dances
a
great
deal
of
the
accommodation
usually
reserved
for
such
revellers
as
desired
rest
or
refreshment
was
being
converted
into
seats
to
be
sold
to
any
who
cared
to
witness
a
pageant
of
unwonted
brilliancy
the
fact
that
no
one
of
us
had
attended
a
function
of
this
sort
for
more
than
five
years
and
the
excellence
of
the
cause
on
behalf
of
which
it
was
being
promoted
were
responsible
for
our
inclination
to
take
the
tickets
for
with
the
exception
of
jill
we
were
not
eager
to
subscribe
to
an
entertainment
which
it
was
not
at
all
certain
we
should
enjoy
at
length
i
suppose
we
better
take
the
tickets
i
said
reflectively
if
we
do
want
to
go
we
need
use
them
oh
we
must
use
them
said
daphne
and
we
got
nothing
on
on
wednesday
as
far
as
i
can
see
berry
cleared
his
throat
it
is
patent
he
said
that
my
personal
convenience
is
of
no
consideration
but
let
that
pass
i
have
no
objection
to
setting
as
it
were
the
seal
of
success
upon
the
ball
in
question
provided
that
my
costume
buttons
in
front
and
has
not
less
than
two
pockets
which
are
at
once
accessible
and
of
a
reasonable
capacity
i
dare
say
they
fashionable
in
the
fourteenth
century
no
doubt
our
forefathers
thought
it
a
scream
to
keep
their
handkerchiefs
in
their
boots
or
the
seat
of
their
trousers
but
i
funny
like
that
last
time
i
had
to
give
the
fellow
in
the
half
a
crown
every
time
i
wanted
to
blow
my
nose
you
four
go
said
jonah
i
always
feel
such
a
fool
in
fancy
dress
if
you
feel
anything
like
the
fool
you
look
said
berry
i
sorry
for
you
jonah
lowered
and
surveyed
the
speaker
what
you
want
he
said
is
a
little
honest
toil
i
should
take
up
scavenging
or
sewerage
something
that
appeals
to
you
i
agree
said
daphne
but
you
ca
start
this
morning
because
coning
with
jill
and
me
to
choose
the
rug
she
turned
to
me
boy
dear
ring
up
and
take
those
tickets
will
you
i
nodded
the
spirit
of
reckless
generosity
which
is
so
prominent
a
characteristic
of
exchange
was
very
noticeable
this
morning
the
number
i
asked
for
which
was
faithfully
repeated
by
the
operator
was
mayfair
i
was
connected
successively
to
hammersmith
museum
and
mayfair
after
a
decent
interval
i
began
again
kennington
road
police
station
said
a
voice
kennington
or
kennington
road
said
i
kennington
road
there
ai
no
kennington
ai
i
mean
are
there
i
always
thought
never
mind
how
are
the
police
i
say
this
is
kennington
road
police
station
replied
the
voice
with
some
heat
i
know
you
did
i
heard
you
just
now
if
you
remember
i
asked
you
if
it
was
kennington
or
kennington
road
and
you
said
you
to
avoid
any
unpleasantness
i
replaced
my
receiver
two
minutes
later
after
an
agreeable
conversation
with
supervisor
i
arranged
to
purchase
five
tickets
for
the
gold
and
silver
ball
this
said
the
salesman
spreading
a
rug
upon
the
top
of
a
pile
is
a
shiraz
i
suppose
said
berry
you
have
got
a
badgerabahd
i
never
came
across
one
sir
they
are
rare
was
the
airy
reply
the
best
ones
used
to
be
made
in
germany
and
sent
to
egypt
by
the
tune
the
camels
had
finished
with
them
they
fetch
anything
from
a
millionaire
to
a
foxhound
this
was
too
much
for
jill
gravity
and
it
was
only
with
an
effort
that
daphne
controlled
her
voice
i
think
that
very
nice
she
said
shakily
do
you
she
added
turning
to
me
beautiful
piece
of
work
i
agreed
some
of
it
appears
to
have
been
done
after
dinner
but
otherwise
the
pattern
is
invariably
a
little
irregular
sir
yes
said
berry
that
what
makes
them
so
valuable
their
lives
are
reflected
in
their
rugs
every
mat
is
a
human
document
with
the
ferrule
of
his
umbrella
he
indicated
a
soft
blue
line
that
was
straying
casually
from
the
course
which
its
fellows
had
taken
that
for
instance
is
where
ethel
the
unready
demanded
a
latchkey
at
the
mature
age
of
and
here
we
see
uncle
sennacherib
fined
two
measures
of
oil
for
being
speechless
before
i
do
think
we
better
give
her
this
one
he
added
the
satyr
seems
to
have
got
going
about
the
middle
and
from
what
i
remember
have
you
got
to
go
and
get
some
socks
said
daphne
desperately
i
have
will
you
meet
me
for
lunch
or
shall
i
meet
you
i
believe
they
do
you
very
well
at
the
zoo
the
salesman
retired
precipitately
into
an
office
and
my
sister
besought
me
tearfully
to
take
her
husband
away
i
might
have
known
she
said
in
a
choking
voice
i
was
a
fool
to
bring
him
let
play
at
bears
said
her
husband
it
a
priceless
game
every
one
gets
under
a
different
rug
and
growls
resignedly
daphne
retired
to
the
sofa
jill
sank
down
upon
the
pile
of
rugs
and
shook
silently
observing
that
we
were
unattended
another
salesman
was
hurrying
in
our
direction
before
he
could
launch
the
inevitable
question
i
want
a
dog
licence
and
some
magic
lanterns
said
berry
you
know
the
ones
that
get
all
hot
and
smell
there
was
a
shriek
of
laughter
from
jill
and
the
unfortunate
assistant
looked
round
wildly
as
if
for
support
clearly
something
had
to
be
done
i
stepped
forward
and
slid
my
arm
through
that
of
the
delinquent
enough
said
i
come
and
devil
the
hosier
if
you
not
quick
all
the
socks
will
be
gone
my
eyed
me
suspiciously
and
leave
my
baggage
he
demanded
pointing
to
daphne
never
this
is
a
ruse
where
is
the
manager
of
the
emporium
i
dreamed
about
him
last
night
he
had
brown
boots
on
i
consulted
my
watch
before
replying
by
the
time
we
get
to
the
club
martinis
will
be
in
season
do
you
mean
that
said
berry
i
do
and
a
small
but
pungent
cigar
i
nodded
he
turned
to
the
bewildered
salesman
please
attend
to
these
ladies
they
want
to
choose
an
rug
preferably
a
shiraz
no
doubt
they
will
be
safe
in
your
hands
good
morning
on
the
way
out
he
stopped
at
a
counter
and
purchased
one
of
the
prettiest
bead
bags
i
have
ever
seen
he
ordered
it
to
be
sent
to
daphne
the
omnibus
was
sailing
down
oxford
street
at
a
good
round
pace
but
it
was
the
sudden
draught
from
a
side
street
that
twitched
my
hat
from
my
head
i
turned
to
see
the
former
describe
a
somewhat
elegant
curve
and
make
a
beautiful
landing
upon
the
canopy
of
a
large
limousine
which
was
standing
by
the
kerb
some
seventy
yards
away
by
the
time
i
had
alighted
that
distance
was
substantially
increased
in
some
dudgeon
i
proceeded
to
walk
with
such
remnants
of
dignity
as
i
could
collect
and
retain
in
tie
direction
of
my
lost
property
wisdom
suggested
that
i
should
run
but
i
felt
that
the
spectacle
of
a
young
man
hatless
but
otherwise
decently
dressed
and
adequately
protected
from
the
severity
of
the
weather
needed
but
the
suggestion
of
impatience
to
make
it
wholly
ridiculous
my
vanity
was
rightly
served
i
was
still
about
thirty
paces
from
my
objective
when
the
limousine
drew
out
from
the
pavement
and
into
the
stream
of
traffic
which
was
hurrying
east
as
my
lips
framed
a
particularly
unpleasant
expletive
a
bell
rang
sharply
and
i
turned
to
see
a
taxi
which
had
that
moment
been
dismissed
oxford
circus
i
cried
flinging
open
the
door
a
moment
later
we
were
near
enough
for
me
to
indicate
the
large
limousine
and
to
instruct
my
driver
to
follow
her
as
we
swept
into
regent
park
i
began
to
wonder
whether
i
should
not
have
been
wiser
to
drive
to
bond
street
and
buy
a
new
hat
by
the
time
we
had
been
twice
round
the
ring
i
had
no
longer
any
doubt
on
this
point
but
my
blood
was
up
and
i
was
determined
to
run
my
quarry
to
earth
even
if
it
involved
a
journey
to
hither
green
more
than
once
we
were
almost
three
times
we
were
caught
in
a
block
of
traffic
so
that
my
taxi
bonnet
was
nosing
the
limousine
tank
once
i
got
out
but
as
i
stepped
into
the
road
the
waiting
stream
was
released
and
the
car
slid
away
and
round
the
hull
of
a
from
under
my
very
hand
my
escape
from
a
disfiguring
death
beneath
the
wheels
of
a
lorry
was
so
narrow
that
i
refrained
from
a
second
attempt
to
curtail
my
pursuit
and
resigned
myself
to
playing
a
waiting
game
when
we
emerged
from
the
park
my
spirits
rose
and
i
fell
to
studying
what
i
could
see
of
the
lines
of
the
limousine
and
to
speculating
whether
i
was
being
led
to
claridge
or
the
ritz
i
had
just
pronounced
in
favour
of
the
latter
when
there
fell
upon
my
ears
the
long
regular
spasm
of
ringing
which
is
a
peremptory
demand
for
instant
way
mechanically
the
order
was
everywhere
obeyed
the
street
was
none
too
wide
and
a
second
and
louder
burst
of
resonance
declared
that
the
was
hard
upon
our
heels
the
twenty
yards
separating
us
from
the
limousine
were
my
undoing
with
a
helpless
glance
at
me
over
his
shoulder
my
driver
pulled
in
to
the
kerb
and
we
had
the
felicity
of
watching
the
great
blue
car
turn
down
a
convenient
side
street
and
flash
out
of
sight
the
engine
swept
by
at
a
high
smooth
speed
the
traffic
emerged
from
its
state
of
suspended
animation
and
in
some
annoyance
i
put
my
head
out
of
the
window
and
directed
my
driver
to
drive
to
bond
street
i
had
chosen
a
new
hat
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
shop
when
a
chauffeur
entered
with
a
soft
grey
hat
in
his
hand
the
hat
resembled
the
one
i
had
lost
and
for
a
moment
i
hesitated
then
it
occurred
to
me
that
there
were
many
such
hats
in
london
and
i
passed
on
and
out
of
the
door
of
course
it
was
only
a
coincidence
still
opposite
me
drawn
up
by
the
kerb
was
the
large
blue
limousine
the
next
moment
i
was
back
in
the
shop
i
rather
think
that
my
hat
i
said
the
chauffeur
looked
round
is
it
sir
ladyship
see
it
on
top
o
the
canopy
just
as
i
put
down
at
the
berkeley
she
says
a
on
the
car
me
lady
says
i
says
she
it
down
i
fetches
it
down
and
shows
it
a
nice
noo
too
she
says
must
have
blowed
orf
of
a
gent
an
on
top
of
a
as
like
as
not
then
she
looks
inside
and
see
the
initials
and
the
name
o
the
shop
it
back
where
it
come
from
she
says
know
oose
it
is
good
me
lady
said
i
an
come
straight
down
sir
i
took
off
the
hat
i
was
wearing
and
bade
him
read
the
initials
which
had
just
been
placed
there
he
did
so
reluctantly
then
very
glad
to
found
you
so
quick
sir
shall
i
tell
them
to
send
it
along
you
wo
want
to
carry
it
i
see
to
that
said
i
taking
it
out
of
his
hand
why
did
it
blow
off
your
canopy
the
spare
cover
was
it
sir
must
shifted
on
to
the
brim
as
soon
as
it
come
there
i
do
know
long
best
part
of
an
hour
i
said
shortly
giving
him
a
piece
good
day
and
thanks
very
much
he
touched
his
cap
and
withdrew
a
wrestle
with
mental
arithmetic
showed
me
that
the
draught
which
i
had
encountered
nearly
an
hour
before
had
cost
me
exactly
one
and
a
half
guineas
ordinarily
i
should
have
dismissed
the
matter
from
my
mind
but
for
some
reason
i
had
no
sooner
let
the
chauffeur
go
than
i
was
tormented
by
a
persistent
curiosity
regarding
the
identity
of
his
considerate
mistress
if
i
had
not
promised
to
rejoin
berry
for
lunch
a
meal
for
which
i
was
already
half
an
hour
late
i
should
have
gone
to
the
berkeley
and
scrutinized
the
guests
the
reflection
that
such
a
proceeding
must
only
have
been
unprofitable
consoled
me
not
at
all
so
contrary
a
maid
is
speculation
for
the
next
two
hours
vexation
rode
me
on
the
curb
i
quarrelled
with
berry
i
was
annoyed
with
myself
and
when
the
at
the
club
casually
observed
that
there
was
a
nasty
wind
i
agreed
with
such
hearty
and
unexpected
bitterness
that
he
started
violently
and
dropped
the
pile
of
letters
which
he
was
searching
on
my
behalf
a
visit
to
lincoln
inn
fields
however
with
regard
to
an
estate
of
which
i
was
a
trustee
followed
by
a
sharp
walk
in
the
park
did
much
to
reduce
the
ridiculous
fever
of
which
my
folly
lay
sick
and
i
returned
home
in
a
frame
of
mind
almost
as
comfortable
as
that
in
which
i
had
set
out
it
was
four
but
no
one
of
the
others
was
in
so
i
ordered
tea
to
be
brought
to
the
library
and
settled
down
to
the
composition
of
a
letter
to
i
was
in
the
act
of
recasting
my
second
sentence
when
the
light
went
out
by
the
glow
of
the
fire
i
made
my
way
to
the
door
a
glance
showed
me
that
the
hall
and
the
staircase
were
in
darkness
it
was
evident
that
a
fuse
had
come
to
a
violent
end
i
closed
the
door
and
returned
to
my
seat
then
i
reached
for
the
telephone
and
put
the
receiver
to
my
ear
what
an
extraordinary
thing
said
a
voice
and
you
no
idea
whose
it
was
not
the
slightest
came
the
reply
there
was
a
musical
note
in
the
girlish
tone
that
would
have
attracted
any
one
there
it
was
on
the
top
of
the
car
when
we
got
to
the
berkeley
it
was
such
a
bad
hat
either
excuse
me
said
i
it
was
a
jolly
good
hat
a
long
tense
silence
followed
my
interruption
at
length
i
say
are
you
there
dot
yes
came
the
reply
in
an
excited
whisper
who
was
that
speaking
i
not
the
faintest
idea
rejoined
the
first
voice
i
had
heard
somebody
must
have
got
on
to
our
line
i
expect
a
familiar
explosion
severed
the
sentence
with
the
clean
efficiency
of
the
guillotine
is
that
sickening
said
i
now
we
shall
never
know
what
her
theory
was
it
all
your
fault
whoever
you
are
if
you
had
butted
in
i
do
know
what
you
mean
i
retorted
i
was
ushered
into
your
presence
so
to
speak
by
force
french
very
difficult
well
when
you
heard
us
talking
you
ought
to
have
got
off
the
line
i
should
have
if
you
had
started
disparaging
my
headgear
i
repeat
it
was
a
hat
of
unusual
elegance
it
had
a
personality
of
its
own
but
it
was
your
hat
we
were
discussing
i
sighed
all
right
i
said
wearily
it
was
have
it
your
own
way
some
other
fool
followed
a
homburg
twice
round
the
park
this
morning
some
other
fool
a
little
gasp
interrupted
me
but
how
did
you
know
my
number
i
did
i
do
i
never
could
have
been
about
to
should
negatives
all
the
way
it
just
chance
my
dear
chance
with
a
capital
j
i
mean
mind
if
i
smoke
her
reply
was
preceded
by
a
refreshing
gurgle
not
at
all
said
my
lady
mean
to
say
you
chased
us
all
that
way
further
and
if
it
had
been
for
that
i
remember
wilkins
turned
down
a
exactly
what
a
shame
well
if
you
go
to
your
hatter
you
get
it
again
your
ingenuity
is
only
equalled
by
your
consideration
is
that
neatly
put
you
see
i
writing
a
letter
to
and
when
i
get
going
i
can
just
say
things
like
that
one
after
another
how
wonderful
but
i
afraid
i
interrupting
you
and
i
like
to
deprive
humanity
your
name
said
i
is
dot
but
i
shall
call
you
mockery
and
if
you
half
as
sweet
as
you
sound
i
protested
earnestly
please
do
say
that
we
only
just
met
besides
why
was
clapham
common
clapham
what
no
common
why
was
clapham
common
well
why
was
it
i
ca
think
my
dear
i
thought
you
might
know
it
worried
me
for
years
there
was
a
choking
sound
which
suggested
indignation
struggling
with
laughter
then
i
a
good
mind
to
ring
off
right
away
said
dot
in
a
shaking
voice
that
would
be
cruel
think
of
the
dance
you
led
me
this
morning
more
think
of
the
dances
you
going
to
give
me
on
wednesday
week
oh
you
going
are
you
if
you
are
what
as
she
demanded
a
in
the
time
of
henry
the
fourth
and
you
i
ca
rise
to
that
i
going
as
myself
in
a
silver
frock
could
anything
be
sweeter
a
little
silver
dot
i
shall
cancel
the
i
mean
and
go
as
carry
one
then
we
can
dance
together
all
the
evening
by
the
way
in
case
i
do
hear
your
voice
how
shall
i
know
you
a
dot
said
my
lady
is
that
which
hath
position
but
no
magnitude
possibly
said
i
it
hath
also
a
dear
voice
which
though
it
be
produced
indefinitely
will
never
tire
all
the
same
in
view
of
the
capacity
of
the
albert
hall
you
not
given
me
much
to
go
on
as
a
matter
of
fact
each
of
us
is
going
as
a
parallel
line
and
why
i
can
tell
you
that
i
like
the
sound
of
you
and
oh
well
enough
said
thank
you
dot
and
why
parallel
lines
they
never
meet
so
long
there
was
a
faint
chunk
my
lady
had
rung
off
heavily
i
hung
up
my
receiver
when
the
others
came
in
i
was
still
sitting
in
the
dark
at
the
table
thinking
the
bitter
wind
reigned
over
london
for
seven
long
days
meting
untempered
chastisement
to
its
reluctant
subjects
and
dying
unwept
and
gasping
on
a
monday
night
tuesday
was
fair
still
by
comparison
and
indeed
the
sun
shone
and
the
sky
was
blue
and
the
smoke
rose
straight
out
of
its
chimneys
with
never
the
breath
of
a
breeze
to
bend
it
or
even
to
set
its
columns
swaying
over
the
high
roofs
there
was
a
great
calm
but
with
it
all
the
weather
was
terribly
cold
that
rare
beauty
which
dusk
may
bring
to
the
metropolis
was
that
evening
vouchsafed
streets
that
were
mean
put
off
their
squalor
ways
that
were
handsome
became
superb
grime
went
unnoticed
ugliness
fell
away
all
things
crude
or
staring
became
indistinct
veiled
with
a
web
of
that
soft
quality
which
only
atmosphere
can
spin
and
having
spun
hang
about
buildings
of
a
windless
eve
as
night
drew
on
magic
came
stealing
down
the
blurred
highways
lamps
became
lanterns
shedding
a
muffled
light
deepening
and
charging
with
mystery
the
darkness
beyond
old
friends
grew
unfamiliar
where
they
had
stood
fantastic
shapes
loomed
out
of
the
mist
and
topless
towers
rose
up
spectral
to
baffle
memory
perspective
fled
shadow
and
stuff
were
one
and
save
where
the
radiance
of
the
shops
in
some
proud
thoroughfare
made
gaudy
noon
of
evening
the
streets
of
town
were
changed
to
echoing
halls
and
long
dim
rambling
galleries
hung
all
with
twinkling
lights
that
stabbed
the
gloom
but
deep
enough
to
show
their
presence
as
do
the
stars
so
slowly
and
with
a
dazzling
smile
london
put
on
her
cloak
of
darkness
by
eight
you
could
not
see
two
paces
ahead
on
wednesday
morning
the
fog
was
denser
than
it
had
been
the
night
before
there
was
no
sign
of
its
abatement
not
a
puff
of
wind
elbowed
its
way
through
the
yellow
drift
and
the
cold
was
intense
the
prospect
of
leaving
a
comfortable
home
at
nine
in
the
evening
to
undertake
a
journey
of
some
two
miles
clad
in
habiliments
which
while
highly
ornamental
were
about
as
protective
from
cold
as
a
rug
was
anything
but
alluring
for
reasons
of
my
own
however
i
was
determined
to
get
to
the
ball
my
sister
whom
nothing
daunted
and
jill
who
was
wild
with
excitement
and
had
promised
readily
to
reserve
more
dances
than
could
possibly
be
rendered
were
equally
firm
jonah
thought
it
a
fool
game
and
said
as
much
berry
was
of
the
same
opinion
but
expressed
it
less
bluntly
and
much
more
offensively
after
a
long
tirade
all
right
he
concluded
you
go
it
lombard
street
to
a
china
orange
you
never
get
there
and
if
you
do
you
never
get
back
none
of
the
band
turn
up
and
if
you
find
twenty
other
fools
in
the
building
to
exchange
colds
with
you
be
lucky
to
leave
your
home
on
a
night
like
this
is
fairly
clamouring
for
the
special
brand
of
trouble
they
keep
for
paralytic
idiots
i
known
you
all
too
long
to
expect
sagacity
but
the
instinct
of
characterizes
even
the
lower
animals
what
swine
for
instance
would
leave
its
cosy
sty
how
dare
you
said
daphne
besides
you
ca
say
plural
my
reference
was
to
the
was
the
cold
reply
a
singular
species
comparable
only
with
the
i
think
you
very
unkind
said
jill
pouting
boy
can
walk
in
front
with
a
lamp
and
jonah
can
walk
behind
with
a
lamp
and
i
can
walk
on
both
sides
i
suppose
with
a
brazier
in
either
hand
oh
this
is
too
easy
we
can
but
try
said
i
you
can
but
close
your
ugly
head
said
berry
if
you
want
to
walk
about
london
half
the
night
looking
like
a
demobilised
pantaloon
push
off
and
do
it
but
do
try
and
rope
in
innocent
parties
to
this
insult
i
made
an
appropriate
reply
and
the
argument
waxed
at
length
there
no
reason
said
jonah
why
we
should
go
on
like
this
for
ever
if
we
had
any
sense
we
should
send
for
fitch
and
desire
his
opinion
it
rather
more
valuable
than
any
one
of
ours
and
after
all
he
more
or
less
interested
and
you
can
trust
him
now
fitch
was
our
chauffeur
amid
a
chorus
of
approval
i
went
to
the
telephone
to
speak
to
the
garage
i
was
still
waiting
to
be
connected
when
is
that
the
club
said
a
voice
no
said
i
nothing
like
it
well
there
a
bag
of
mine
in
the
hall
and
no
there
is
said
i
what
mean
was
the
indignant
retort
what
i
say
our
hall
is
bagless
i
say
said
the
voice
with
laboured
clarity
i
say
there
is
a
bag
in
the
hall
a
bag
hang
it
all
you
know
what
a
bag
is
rather
said
i
heartily
what
you
put
nuts
in
an
uncle
of
mine
had
one
the
vehemence
with
which
the
unknown
subscriber
replaced
his
receiver
was
terrible
to
hear
ten
minutes
later
fitch
entered
the
room
can
you
get
to
the
albert
hall
fitch
said
daphne
i
think
so
madam
if
we
go
slow
can
you
get
back
from
the
albert
hall
afternoon
said
berry
if
i
can
get
there
sir
i
can
get
back
how
long
will
it
take
i
ought
to
do
it
in
an
hour
sir
i
can
push
along
in
the
park
where
it
all
straight
going
it
getting
along
the
streets
as
take
the
time
it
not
that
i
wo
find
me
way
but
it
the
watchin
out
for
the
hother
vehicles
so
as
they
do
run
into
you
bit
of
an
optimist
are
you
i
do
think
so
sir
thank
you
fitch
said
daphne
hastily
nine
please
very
good
madam
he
bowed
and
withdrew
triumphantly
my
sister
regarded
her
husband
at
making
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
she
said
no
one
can
touch
you
berry
returned
her
gaze
with
a
malevolent
stare
then
he
put
a
thumb
to
his
nose
and
extended
his
fingers
in
her
direction
the
unfortunate
incident
occurred
in
the
vicinity
of
stanhope
gate
so
far
we
had
come
very
slowly
but
without
incident
and
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
we
were
insufficiently
clad
we
were
nice
and
warm
for
this
so
far
as
berry
and
i
were
concerned
two
footwarmers
and
a
pair
of
rugs
were
largely
responsible
for
the
elaborate
nature
of
our
costumes
put
the
wearing
of
overcoats
out
of
the
question
a
italian
cloak
of
the
shape
that
was
seen
in
the
time
of
elizabeth
made
it
impossible
for
me
to
wear
a
of
any
description
and
i
was
reduced
to
wrapping
a
muffler
about
my
neck
and
holding
a
woollen
shawl
across
my
chest
while
berry
in
that
puffed
and
swollen
array
which
instantly
remembers
henry
the
eighth
derived
what
comfort
he
could
from
an
enormous
cloak
of
irish
frieze
which
while
it
left
his
chest
uncovered
succeeded
in
giving
him
a
back
about
four
feet
square
hitherto
we
had
encountered
little
or
no
traffic
and
an
excellent
judgment
coupled
with
something
akin
to
instinct
on
the
part
of
fitch
had
brought
us
surely
along
the
streets
but
here
almost
before
we
knew
it
there
were
vehicles
in
front
and
on
either
side
hoarse
directions
were
being
shouted
lanterns
were
being
waved
engines
were
running
and
a
few
feet
away
frantic
endeavours
were
being
made
to
persuade
a
pair
of
horses
to
disregard
twin
headlights
whose
brilliancy
was
adding
to
the
confusion
berry
lowered
the
window
what
about
it
fitch
well
sir
i
just
opposite
the
gate
but
it
rather
awkward
to
slip
across
in
case
i
meet
somethin
if
i
to
pull
up
we
might
be
run
into
which
means
that
one
of
us
must
guide
you
over
it
be
safer
sir
by
a
majority
of
three
it
was
decided
that
berry
should
enact
the
of
conducting
officer
jonah
had
a
cold
and
was
sitting
on
the
back
seat
between
the
girls
i
had
no
coat
and
required
the
services
of
both
hands
if
i
was
to
hold
my
shawl
in
position
only
my
remained
he
did
not
go
down
without
a
struggle
but
after
a
vigorous
but
vain
appeal
to
our
better
natures
he
compared
himself
to
a
lion
beset
by
jackals
commented
bitterly
upon
the
hot
air
which
is
breathed
about
and
directing
that
after
death
his
veins
should
be
opened
in
the
presence
of
not
less
than
twelve
surgeons
as
a
preliminary
to
his
interment
in
the
dogs
cemetery
opened
the
door
and
stepped
sideways
into
the
roadway
his
efforts
to
remove
the
offside
oil
lamp
which
was
hot
to
the
touch
were
most
diverting
and
twice
he
returned
to
the
window
to
ask
us
to
make
less
noise
at
last
however
with
the
assistance
of
fitch
the
lamp
was
unhooked
and
a
moment
later
our
absurd
advanced
cautiously
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
fitch
let
in
the
clutch
we
must
have
been
across
when
a
lamp
of
extraordinary
power
came
gliding
up
on
the
near
side
confusing
all
eyes
and
altogether
effacing
our
guiding
light
fitch
applied
his
brakes
and
cried
out
a
warning
instantly
the
lamp
stopped
but
its
glare
was
blinding
and
our
chauffeur
was
clearly
afraid
to
move
in
a
flash
i
was
out
of
the
car
and
holding
my
shawl
over
the
face
of
the
offender
at
once
fitch
took
the
car
forward
as
i
fell
in
behind
i
heard
berry
voice
thank
you
i
hope
i
did
jostle
your
yes
i
am
completely
and
utterly
lost
no
i
do
mind
at
all
i
going
to
bale
out
the
and
sleep
there
and
in
the
morning
they
take
me
to
the
foundling
hospital
hullo
that
done
it
blind
me
first
and
then
run
me
down
what
are
you
a
travelling
lighthouse
or
an
want
to
get
to
cannon
street
well
i
should
go
round
by
sea
if
i
were
you
well
if
you
must
know
i
mary
pickford
about
to
be
trodden
to
death
in
or
you
know
you
not
racing
your
engine
enough
i
can
still
hear
myself
think
his
voice
grew
fainter
and
stopped
vigorously
i
shouted
his
name
a
cold
draught
and
we
swept
into
the
park
fitch
pulled
up
on
the
side
berry
berry
i
shouted
in
the
distance
i
could
hear
voices
but
no
one
answered
me
in
response
to
my
sister
exhortations
i
the
car
and
drew
a
rug
over
my
shivering
limbs
the
others
put
their
heads
out
of
the
windows
and
shouted
for
berry
in
unison
there
was
no
reply
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
we
shouted
at
intervals
then
jonah
took
the
other
lamp
and
returned
to
the
gate
he
did
not
reappear
for
ten
minutes
and
we
were
beginning
to
give
him
up
when
to
our
relief
he
opened
the
door
no
good
he
said
curtly
we
better
get
on
he
probably
gone
home
i
suppose
he
all
right
said
daphne
in
some
uneasiness
you
ca
come
to
any
harm
on
foot
said
i
everything
going
dead
slow
for
its
own
sake
and
when
i
last
heard
him
he
was
having
the
time
of
his
life
incidentally
as
like
as
not
he
strike
a
car
going
to
the
ball
and
ask
for
a
lift
i
expect
he
will
said
jill
there
must
be
any
amount
on
the
way
all
right
said
my
sister
tell
fitch
to
carry
on
twenty
minutes
later
that
good
helmsman
set
us
down
at
the
main
entrance
to
the
albert
hall
the
conditions
prevailing
within
that
edifice
suggested
that
few
if
any
had
been
deterred
from
attending
by
the
conditions
prevailing
without
the
boxes
were
full
the
floor
was
packed
the
corridors
were
thronged
with
eager
shining
revellers
dancing
and
strolling
and
chattering
to
beat
the
band
which
was
flooding
every
corner
of
the
enormous
building
with
an
air
of
gaiety
so
infectious
that
even
the
staid
jonah
began
to
grumble
that
the
dance
would
be
over
before
the
girls
emerged
from
the
cloakroom
the
field
of
the
cloth
of
gold
can
not
have
presented
a
more
splendid
spectacle
true
there
was
nothing
of
the
pageant
about
the
function
neither
were
pomp
and
chivalry
among
the
guests
but
grace
was
there
and
ease
and
artlessness
lending
the
scene
that
warmth
and
life
and
verity
which
form
and
ceremony
do
not
allow
the
utter
hopelessness
of
encountering
my
lady
of
the
limousine
was
so
apparent
that
i
relegated
a
ridiculous
notion
which
i
had
been
harbouring
to
the
region
of
things
impossible
and
determined
to
think
about
it
no
more
for
all
that
i
occasionally
found
myself
scanning
the
crowd
of
strangers
and
wondering
whether
there
was
one
amongst
them
whose
voice
i
knew
it
was
during
one
of
these
lapses
that
i
heard
my
name
who
have
you
lost
asked
maisie
dukedom
all
radiant
as
a
gold
shepherdess
dance
with
me
said
i
and
i
tell
you
she
glanced
at
a
tiny
i
promised
i
would
stay
more
than
an
hour
she
said
and
i
ought
to
be
going
but
i
want
to
thank
you
for
that
beautiful
rug
if
i
give
you
the
next
will
you
get
the
car
for
me
as
soon
as
it
over
if
you
must
go
she
nodded
and
we
pushed
off
into
the
rapids
and
now
who
is
it
she
demanded
i
thought
you
were
going
to
thank
me
for
the
rug
she
made
a
little
grimace
of
impatience
the
best
way
i
can
thank
you
is
to
tell
you
the
truth
jack
and
i
went
to
buy
a
rug
at
lucifer
that
where
we
got
yours
she
pinched
my
arm
will
you
listen
we
must
have
got
to
the
shop
directly
you
left
the
one
you
bought
was
still
lying
there
we
both
thought
it
feet
above
any
other
rug
there
and
when
they
said
it
was
sold
i
nearly
cried
we
were
so
fed
up
that
we
said
we
would
get
a
rug
at
all
and
went
off
to
look
at
and
chests
of
drawers
i
did
get
home
till
six
and
when
i
did
there
was
your
present
are
you
satisfied
overwhelmed
good
now
who
the
lady
that
just
what
i
ca
tell
you
i
know
her
voice
but
not
her
countenance
her
name
is
dot
lady
dot
she
drives
in
a
blue
limousine
and
she
here
maisie
assumed
a
serious
air
this
she
said
is
terrible
does
your
life
depend
upon
finding
her
i
mean
it
worse
than
a
needle
in
a
bundle
of
hay
is
it
infinitely
you
can
wash
out
the
limousine
because
you
wo
see
it
and
the
voice
because
you
wo
hear
it
and
her
name
because
she
wo
be
labelled
there
really
nothing
left
is
there
gloomily
i
assented
i
sorry
said
maisie
i
like
to
have
helped
the
music
slowed
up
and
died
and
now
will
you
see
me
off
we
made
our
way
towards
the
exit
i
had
found
her
footman
and
sent
him
to
summon
the
car
and
was
standing
within
the
main
entrance
when
a
familiar
figure
began
with
difficulty
to
emerge
from
a
car
which
had
just
arrived
berry
having
succeeded
in
projecting
himself
on
to
the
steps
he
turned
to
hand
his
companion
out
of
the
car
as
he
did
so
presenting
to
the
astonished
doorkeepers
a
back
of
such
startling
dimensions
that
the
one
nearest
to
me
recoiled
for
all
his
seasoning
i
was
wondering
who
was
the
muffled
samaritan
that
had
brought
him
along
when
the
chauffeur
leaned
forward
as
if
to
receive
instructions
when
to
return
the
light
of
the
lamp
showed
me
the
genial
features
of
that
communicative
fellow
who
had
restored
my
grey
hat
some
nine
days
before
tall
and
slight
his
mistress
turned
to
the
doorway
and
i
saw
a
head
couped
at
the
throat
by
the
white
of
an
ermine
stole
dark
hair
swept
low
over
her
forehead
an
attractive
smile
sat
on
her
pretty
mouth
and
there
was
a
fine
colour
springing
in
her
cheeks
she
looked
up
to
see
me
staring
for
a
moment
a
pair
of
grey
eyes
met
mine
steadily
then
is
the
car
here
said
maisie
over
my
shoulder
hullo
berry
suddenly
she
saw
his
companion
betty
my
dear
i
thought
you
were
in
scotland
under
pretence
of
arranging
her
wrap
i
breathed
into
her
ear
introduce
me
she
did
so
without
a
tremor
and
give
him
the
next
dance
for
me
she
added
i
just
cut
one
of
his
and
he
been
most
forgiving
too
late
said
berry
i
have
not
wasted
the
shining
thirty
minutes
which
i
have
just
spent
in
lady
elizabeth
luxurious
car
she
knows
him
for
the
craven
that
he
is
i
must
judge
for
myself
said
my
lady
turning
to
me
with
a
smile
he
given
you
a
terrible
the
sentence
was
never
finished
for
berry
turned
to
look
at
somebody
and
maisie
noticed
his
back
for
the
first
time
her
involuntary
cry
was
succeeded
by
a
peal
of
laughter
which
attracted
the
attention
of
every
one
within
earshot
and
in
a
moment
my
found
himself
the
object
of
much
interested
amusement
which
the
majority
of
onlookers
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
my
lady
fled
to
her
cloakroom
hastily
i
escorted
maisie
still
helpless
with
laughter
to
her
car
i
returned
to
find
berry
entertaining
a
large
audience
of
complete
strangers
in
the
vestibule
with
a
fantastic
account
of
his
experiences
at
stanhope
gate
concealing
myself
behind
a
pillar
i
awaited
lady
elizabeth
return
yes
said
berry
betrayed
by
my
accomplices
i
found
myself
as
it
were
a
shred
of
flotsam
adrift
in
the
darkling
streets
several
people
thought
i
was
the
marble
arch
and
left
me
on
the
left
others
more
discerning
conjured
me
to
pull
in
to
the
kerb
removing
from
my
north
instep
the
hoof
which
upon
examination
i
found
to
be
attached
to
a
large
mammal
i
started
to
wade
and
by
south
hoping
against
hope
and
steering
by
the
milky
way
happily
i
had
my
and
i
derived
great
comfort
from
its
pregnant
directions
which
i
read
from
time
to
time
by
the
smell
of
the
lamp
which
i
was
bearing
here
my
lady
appeared
and
i
led
her
into
the
corridor
and
on
to
the
floor
as
she
had
promised
she
was
wearing
a
silver
frock
one
white
shoulder
was
left
bare
and
a
heavy
fringe
that
swayed
evenly
with
her
every
movement
made
the
sum
line
of
her
dress
still
more
graceful
silvery
stockings
covered
her
gleaming
ankles
and
she
was
shod
with
silver
shoes
for
a
little
we
spoke
of
berry
and
she
told
me
how
he
had
boarded
her
car
and
respectfully
begged
her
compassion
then
i
spoke
of
the
bitter
wind
which
had
blown
us
about
so
inconsiderately
before
the
fog
had
come
to
lay
upon
us
stripes
of
another
kind
i
lost
my
hat
one
day
i
added
casually
at
that
she
jumped
in
my
arms
as
if
i
had
stabbed
her
but
i
took
no
notice
and
we
danced
on
deliberately
i
recounted
my
loss
and
my
pursuit
only
omitting
my
encounter
with
her
chauffeur
i
happen
to
know
i
concluded
that
the
lady
of
the
limousine
is
here
before
the
ball
is
over
i
shall
have
danced
with
her
but
you
never
seen
her
she
protested
i
know
her
voice
she
laughed
musically
are
you
a
bit
of
an
optimist
she
queried
i
do
think
so
and
she
just
sweet
but
if
you
do
know
her
name
how
can
you
hope
her
name
i
said
is
dot
the
hand
upon
my
shoulder
shook
slightly
we
danced
on
at
length
that
not
very
much
to
go
on
said
elizabeth
i
sighed
do
discourage
me
i
said
when
i
find
her
think
she
give
me
the
seven
dances
she
said
she
would
i
never
she
choked
and
began
to
cough
violently
so
that
i
drew
her
out
of
the
press
and
into
a
vacant
corner
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
she
continued
ingeniously
you
wicked
girl
said
i
why
was
clapham
common
for
a
moment
she
looked
at
me
speechless
then
she
began
to
laugh
tremulously
with
a
crash
the
jazz
came
to
an
end
almost
immediately
another
orchestra
took
up
the
running
and
the
strains
of
a
valse
rose
up
plaintive
and
tempting
i
looked
at
my
lady
have
i
earned
my
dances
dot
she
hesitated
then
carry
on
carry
one
she
said
chapter
iv
how
nobby
came
to
sleep
upon
my
bed
and
berry
fell
among
thieves
thoughtfully
i
read
the
letter
again
it
nearly
breaks
my
heart
to
say
so
but
i
got
to
part
with
nobby
i
going
to
india
to
join
richard
you
know
and
i
sailing
next
week
i
think
you
get
on
together
he
a
dog
and
a
bit
with
strangers
all
sealyhams
are
but
he
a
good
little
chap
very
sporting
very
healthy
and
a
real
beauty
let
me
know
one
way
or
the
other
and
if
you
like
to
have
him
i
send
him
round
with
his
licence
and
very
sincerely
he
always
slept
on
my
the
letter
had
been
forwarded
to
me
from
london
for
i
was
spending
the
in
leicestershire
with
the
scarlets
i
looked
across
the
flagged
hall
to
my
host
who
was
leaning
against
a
table
with
a
hunting
horn
in
each
hand
listening
critically
to
the
noise
he
was
making
and
endeavouring
to
decide
upon
which
of
the
two
instruments
he
could
wind
the
most
inspiring
call
live
and
let
live
said
i
with
a
grin
bertram
suspended
his
operations
listen
i
been
offered
a
sealyham
take
him
was
the
reply
your
guests
will
regret
it
but
you
wo
they
and
they
always
full
of
beans
hard
as
nails
too
he
added
you
never
kill
him
tell
me
he
brandished
the
horn
which
he
held
in
his
right
hand
do
you
think
this
sounds
the
best
with
an
effort
he
produced
a
most
distressing
sound
or
this
putting
the
other
to
his
lips
he
emitted
a
precisely
similar
note
there
no
difference
at
all
said
i
crossing
to
a
bureau
equally
painful
they
do
it
rather
better
at
on
the
continent
it
is
patent
said
bertram
that
you
have
no
ear
for
music
all
right
said
i
making
ready
to
write
you
try
it
the
all
sit
up
and
beg
or
something
i
suppose
it
too
much
to
expect
to
find
a
pen
that
write
here
i
added
regarding
uneasily
the
enormous
quill
with
which
the
bureau
was
decorated
that
a
jolly
good
pen
said
bertram
indignantly
every
one
says
so
i
grunted
my
disbelief
which
end
shall
i
use
i
recommend
the
right
one
rejoined
my
host
with
ponderous
sarcasm
but
as
i
have
yet
to
meet
any
one
who
can
read
your
writing
i
suppose
it
matters
i
have
often
deplored
the
company
you
keep
said
i
and
with
that
i
selected
a
large
sheet
of
paper
and
wrote
as
follows
miss
childe
like
to
have
nobby
very
much
i
awfully
sorry
for
you
but
be
very
kind
to
him
for
both
your
sakes
the
reference
you
give
him
is
most
satisfactory
i
suppose
he
want
one
evening
a
week
and
every
other
sunday
and
will
he
do
in
the
front
steps
and
spoil
the
knives
or
only
ruin
the
boots
i
beg
your
pardon
for
the
moment
i
was
thinking
of
the
cook
who
nearly
engaged
us
only
she
wanted
a
pension
after
six
months
service
it
was
very
nice
of
you
to
think
of
me
i
write
you
a
proper
letter
when
i
send
you
a
receipt
i
return
to
town
very
sincerely
he
shall
always
sleep
on
as
i
was
addressing
the
envelope
the
butler
entered
the
hall
i
gave
him
the
letter
and
he
promised
to
see
that
it
was
dispatched
that
day
a
knowledge
of
bertram
household
suggested
this
precaution
as
i
had
told
miss
childe
on
the
following
day
i
returned
to
town
it
was
the
last
monday
but
one
before
christmas
and
jonah
birthday
to
do
the
latter
honour
we
were
to
dine
all
together
at
claridge
and
go
on
to
an
entertainment
presented
in
a
house
in
which
smoking
was
permitted
and
of
such
a
nature
that
you
gained
rather
than
lost
by
arriving
late
i
reached
home
with
sufficient
time
only
to
bathe
and
dress
and
it
was
not
until
we
were
through
dinner
that
i
learned
that
my
letter
to
miss
childe
had
borne
immediate
fruit
by
the
way
said
daphne
suddenly
did
the
servants
give
you
that
message
from
josephine
childe
i
shook
my
head
it
was
down
on
the
telephone
block
but
i
suppose
you
were
too
hurried
to
look
at
that
childe
compliments
and
nobby
will
be
round
this
evening
hardly
i
suppressed
an
exclamation
we
all
mad
to
know
what
it
means
berry
scents
an
intrigue
and
says
it
a
cipher
worse
said
i
it
a
dog
a
dog
cried
daphne
and
jill
together
a
dog
you
know
a
small
quadruped
something
like
a
cat
only
with
hair
i
know
said
berry
excitedly
i
know
i
seen
pictures
of
them
fools
both
of
you
said
my
sister
what
she
giving
you
a
dog
for
i
explained
the
nature
of
the
transaction
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
i
concluded
that
he
will
become
one
of
us
the
others
exchanged
meaning
looks
is
he
any
particular
breed
said
berry
or
just
a
i
braced
myself
with
a
draught
of
champagne
before
replying
then
he
a
sealyham
i
said
uprose
a
damnatory
chorus
i
do
hereby
protest
said
berry
a
barbarous
breed
notorious
for
its
unprovoked
ferocity
peaceable
possession
of
our
tenement
will
be
unknown
ingress
and
egress
will
be
denied
us
substantial
compensation
will
be
an
everyday
affair
any
more
for
the
pasteur
institute
rot
said
i
you
jealous
they
awfully
uncertain
tempers
said
daphne
maisie
dukedom
had
one
and
it
went
down
and
bit
a
new
cook
who
just
come
before
got
her
things
off
they
had
to
give
her
five
pounds
put
her
up
at
an
hotel
for
the
night
and
pay
her
fare
back
to
bristol
and
she
had
wonderful
references
instinct
said
i
the
dog
saw
through
her
they
ought
to
have
been
grateful
truth
is
said
jonah
they
a
bit
too
sporting
for
london
look
here
said
i
consulting
my
watch
at
the
present
moment
the
poor
little
dog
is
probably
fretting
his
soul
out
in
the
servants
hall
so
we
have
to
keep
him
if
he
the
ravening
beast
you
say
he
is
he
shall
be
fired
if
not
i
shall
stick
to
him
fair
enough
is
it
he
going
to
be
a
darling
said
jill
i
sure
of
it
before
we
left
for
the
theatre
i
telephoned
home
and
spoke
to
the
butler
is
that
you
falcon
it
is
sir
any
dogs
come
for
me
only
one
sir
is
he
all
right
seems
a
little
unsettled
sir
and
er
suspicious
he
was
rather
short
with
fitch
sir
when
he
come
in
but
he
had
his
leggin
on
sir
so
there
no
done
he
all
right
with
me
sir
i
thought
of
the
dukedoms
cook
and
moistened
my
lips
see
that
he
has
a
run
on
the
lead
before
you
go
to
bed
i
said
as
nonchalantly
as
possible
and
then
put
him
upstairs
on
my
bed
very
good
sir
i
returned
to
the
lounge
has
the
little
bit
of
heaven
arrived
said
berry
i
nodded
casualties
nil
said
i
everything
in
the
garden
is
lovely
no
doubt
said
berry
and
the
servants
hall
i
suppose
that
a
shambles
do
be
silly
said
i
he
as
good
as
gold
there
you
are
said
jill
staunchly
cupboard
love
said
berry
you
wait
till
we
come
in
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
concentrated
on
me
they
always
aim
high
it
will
be
your
duty
he
added
turning
to
daphne
to
suck
the
wound
that
is
a
wife
privilege
the
best
thing
said
jonah
is
to
hold
a
to
the
place
i
beg
your
pardon
said
berry
well
an
iron
takes
such
a
time
to
heat
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
my
stated
that
he
should
regard
any
such
treatment
as
a
treacherous
and
aggravated
assault
upon
his
person
do
let
there
be
any
mistake
about
it
he
concluded
i
not
going
to
have
any
amateur
burning
holes
in
my
body
in
the
hope
of
being
recommended
by
the
coroner
jury
if
i
got
to
die
i
just
go
mad
in
the
ordinary
way
thank
you
i
wonder
who
i
shall
bite
first
he
added
pleasantly
do
you
worry
said
i
think
what
hydrophobia
means
what
does
it
mean
suspiciously
a
horror
of
water
said
i
you
must
have
had
it
for
years
we
left
the
theatre
about
eleven
we
had
just
come
in
and
i
was
disrobing
in
the
hall
berry
was
speaking
to
the
chauffeur
when
an
exclamation
from
jill
who
was
on
the
point
of
following
daphne
and
jonah
into
the
library
made
me
look
round
on
the
top
step
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
stood
a
little
white
dog
regarding
us
squarely
he
might
have
been
painted
by
maud
earl
his
ears
were
pricked
his
little
forefeet
placed
close
together
his
tail
was
upright
a
gas
officer
would
have
said
that
he
was
in
the
alert
position
hello
nobby
said
i
how
goes
it
at
the
sound
of
his
name
the
terrier
put
his
small
head
on
one
side
with
an
air
of
curiosity
as
evident
as
it
was
attractive
what
a
darling
cried
jill
as
she
spoke
i
heard
a
inserted
and
the
next
moment
berry
pushed
open
the
door
breathing
out
threatenings
the
darling
streaked
down
the
stairs
and
across
the
hall
to
the
feet
where
he
stood
with
his
back
arched
one
raised
and
bared
teeth
emitting
a
long
low
snarl
while
there
was
a
look
in
the
bright
brown
eyes
which
there
was
no
mistaking
my
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
spot
jill
began
to
shake
with
laughter
what
did
i
say
said
berry
remaining
motionless
ca
enter
my
own
house
now
it
all
right
old
chap
he
added
gazing
at
nobby
with
a
winning
smile
i
belong
here
his
statement
was
not
accepted
nobby
who
was
clearly
taking
no
risks
replied
with
a
growl
charged
with
such
malevolence
that
i
thought
it
advisable
to
interfere
i
addressed
myself
to
the
terrier
good
man
i
said
reassuringly
patting
berry
upon
the
shoulder
jonah
contends
that
the
dog
construed
my
movement
as
an
attempted
assault
which
it
was
his
duty
to
abet
in
any
event
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
record
the
growl
culminated
in
that
vicious
flurry
which
invariably
accompanies
the
closing
of
jaws
there
was
a
noise
of
torn
cloth
and
with
a
yell
berry
leapt
for
and
reached
the
bookcase
to
which
he
adhered
clinging
rather
than
perched
after
the
manner
of
a
startled
ape
a
roar
of
laughter
from
me
and
long
tremulous
wails
of
merriment
from
jill
brought
my
sister
and
jonah
pellmell
upon
a
scene
the
four
of
us
huddled
together
helpless
with
mirth
while
berry
calling
upon
sirius
clung
desperately
to
the
bookcase
and
nobby
clearly
interpreting
our
merriment
as
applause
stood
immediately
below
his
victim
panting
a
little
with
excitement
and
wagging
his
tail
tentatively
after
all
said
my
what
is
death
a
excelsior
of
course
i
ought
to
have
a
banner
really
just
to
wave
as
i
fall
two
and
a
half
guineas
these
trousers
cost
think
of
the
dogs
you
could
get
for
that
excelsior
seriously
i
should
get
him
a
set
of
false
teeth
and
keep
them
locked
up
it
save
in
the
end
yes
i
know
it
i
only
sorry
i
have
got
a
tail
then
i
could
hang
from
the
electric
light
as
it
is
what
about
calling
off
the
dog
not
that
i
not
comfortable
and
the
air
up
here
lovely
but
with
an
effort
i
pulled
myself
together
and
laid
a
hand
on
shoulder
here
i
said
nodding
in
berry
direction
here
we
have
the
baboon
an
animal
of
diverting
but
vulgar
habits
that
between
its
eyes
is
its
nose
the
only
other
known
specimen
is
at
dartmoor
mind
not
talking
said
berry
i
just
thinking
out
your
death
they
say
pressing
is
very
painful
or
would
you
rather
call
off
the
mammal
i
picked
up
nobby
and
put
him
under
my
arm
you
know
you
a
wicked
dog
said
i
for
a
moment
his
bright
brown
eyes
met
mine
then
with
a
sudden
movement
he
put
up
a
cold
black
nose
and
licked
my
face
before
we
retired
that
night
berry
had
admitted
that
nobby
had
his
points
nobby
had
accepted
from
berry
a
caviare
sandwich
and
i
had
handed
my
a
cheque
for
two
pounds
twelve
shillings
and
sixpence
it
had
been
arranged
that
we
should
spend
christmas
with
the
martins
in
wiltshire
and
we
were
to
make
the
journey
on
the
high
festival
was
to
be
held
at
red
abbey
a
fine
old
place
with
mullioned
windows
and
a
great
panelled
hall
that
smacked
of
revelry
and
christmas
cheer
even
in
summertime
on
christmas
eve
there
was
to
be
a
dance
on
boxing
day
a
tenants
ball
and
on
christmas
day
itself
the
of
twenty
souls
was
to
assemble
for
dinner
correctly
attired
after
the
manner
of
children
of
tender
years
so
far
as
clothes
could
do
it
the
spirit
of
childhood
was
to
be
recaptured
that
night
guests
had
been
put
upon
their
honour
to
eschew
evasion
kilts
and
sailor
suits
had
been
forbidden
as
was
any
suit
or
frock
which
was
not
the
monopoly
of
juveniles
hair
was
to
be
worn
down
monocles
and
jewellery
were
banned
the
trappings
of
dignity
were
to
be
rigidly
put
off
and
innocence
courted
with
appropriate
mockery
the
composition
of
the
which
had
been
carefully
chosen
promised
an
entertainment
of
more
than
ordinary
interest
on
all
three
evenings
dance
music
was
to
be
discoursed
by
a
famous
coloured
band
whose
services
had
long
ago
been
retained
for
the
occasion
a
engagement
made
it
impossible
for
berry
to
accompany
us
from
london
on
tuesday
he
must
leave
town
for
hampshire
but
were
consulted
and
it
was
discovered
that
he
could
travel
across
country
on
christmas
eve
and
by
changing
from
one
station
to
the
other
at
the
market
town
of
flail
arrive
at
red
abbey
in
time
for
tea
we
can
take
your
luggage
with
us
said
daphne
you
got
all
want
for
the
night
at
white
ladies
it
was
nine
and
we
were
all
in
the
library
resting
after
the
labours
of
the
day
berry
from
the
depths
of
the
sofa
grunted
an
assent
all
the
same
he
added
i
must
take
something
for
instance
and
a
clean
neckerchief
same
as
when
you
enlist
everything
you
can
possibly
want
there
already
foreland
knows
you
coming
and
she
put
everything
out
i
have
a
weakness
replied
her
husband
for
my
own
sponge
moreover
foolhardy
as
it
may
seem
i
still
clean
my
teeth
the
only
question
is
what
to
put
them
in
what
the
matter
with
your
pockets
said
i
nothing
at
present
said
berry
that
why
i
shall
want
your
nothing
doing
said
i
i
refuse
to
subscribe
to
my
own
inconvenience
self
said
berry
bitterly
why
was
i
born
selfish
i
often
tried
but
you
ca
bend
an
oak
can
you
anybody
can
have
my
shirt
at
any
time
languidly
he
regarded
his
cuff
no
not
this
one
but
almost
any
other
my
life
has
been
one
long
unrecognized
sacrifice
and
what
is
my
reward
he
looked
round
about
him
with
pitying
eyes
poor
bloated
worms
you
little
know
the
angel
that
labours
in
your
midst
his
own
being
finished
with
a
sigh
he
took
his
wife
cigarette
from
the
ashtray
which
they
were
sharing
i
had
a
dream
last
night
he
added
comfortably
what
about
said
jill
i
dreamed
said
berry
that
i
was
a
pint
of
of
unusually
broad
beans
several
people
remarked
upon
my
breadth
after
spirited
bidding
i
was
secured
by
no
less
a
personage
than
the
mcaroon
himself
to
whom
i
gave
violent
indigestion
within
hours
pleased
with
this
attention
the
laird
erected
in
my
memory
a
small
bar
at
which
the
rankest
poison
could
be
obtained
at
all
hours
by
asking
in
hebrew
for
ginger
ale
which
reminds
me
i
have
taken
my
medicine
meaningly
he
regarded
the
tray
which
had
just
been
placed
upon
a
the
doctor
said
i
must
move
about
after
meals
or
i
mix
it
myself
as
it
is
he
broke
off
and
looked
round
expectantly
idle
brute
said
daphne
i
wonder
you
are
afraid
to
where
my
cigarette
i
only
lighted
one
a
moment
ago
perhaps
it
behind
your
ear
suggested
her
husband
perhaps
where
the
match
you
lighted
that
one
from
demanded
his
wife
woman
said
berry
indignantly
you
forget
yourself
besides
i
use
a
match
i
kindled
it
by
rubbing
two
sticks
together
same
as
they
do
in
guano
where
the
jelly
comes
from
here
a
diversion
was
caused
by
the
opening
of
the
door
sufficiently
to
admit
a
slightly
damp
white
ball
with
a
black
spot
which
projected
itself
into
the
room
as
if
possessed
nobby
exhilarated
to
frenzy
by
the
reflection
that
at
least
four
days
must
elapse
before
any
one
could
be
bothered
to
bathe
him
again
the
terrier
took
a
flying
leap
on
to
the
sofa
licked
daphne
face
put
a
foot
in
berry
eye
barked
hurled
himself
across
the
room
to
where
jonah
was
playing
patience
upset
the
dashed
three
times
round
the
room
pretended
to
unearth
a
rat
from
the
depths
of
jill
chair
and
finally
flung
himself
exhausted
at
my
feet
i
suppose
this
is
what
they
call
spirits
said
berry
or
christianity
it
is
well
known
said
i
that
exercise
after
a
bath
is
most
beneficial
no
doubt
was
the
icy
reply
well
next
time
i
put
my
foot
in
your
eye
assume
that
i
had
a
bath
and
call
it
will
you
have
you
written
to
the
st
martins
said
daphne
to
say
that
be
a
day
late
i
have
the
masterpiece
is
on
the
awaiting
insertion
in
an
envelope
i
picked
up
the
letter
and
read
aloud
as
follows
am
disposed
to
refer
to
your
invitation
to
make
one
of
the
due
to
assemble
on
the
am
to
say
that
a
malignant
fate
has
decreed
that
i
shall
not
dignify
your
hovel
before
the
evening
of
the
following
feeling
of
profound
disappointment
which
this
announcement
will
provoke
should
be
tempered
by
the
reflection
that
you
are
fortunate
indeed
to
have
secured
so
enchanting
a
personality
for
your
festivities
which
however
hopeless
they
may
appear
can
not
fail
to
be
galvanized
into
some
show
of
life
by
my
inspiring
luggage
and
the
four
ungrateful
parasites
who
have
so
long
battened
upon
my
generosity
will
arrive
on
the
as
arranged
one
of
the
latter
has
stealthily
acquired
a
mongrel
which
provided
he
can
obtain
the
necessary
permit
he
proposes
to
bring
with
him
my
protests
against
this
abuse
of
hospitality
have
been
received
with
that
vulgar
insolence
which
i
have
alas
learned
to
am
to
request
you
to
remember
that
i
am
visiting
you
incognito
as
the
duke
of
blackpool
and
that
at
this
season
it
is
my
practice
to
consume
a
and
a
bottle
of
beer
before
am
madam
obedient
servant
outrageous
said
daphne
perfectly
outrageous
however
there
no
time
to
write
another
so
it
had
better
go
boy
be
a
dear
and
answer
that
invitation
for
me
this
lecture
thing
said
i
holding
up
a
card
my
sister
nodded
we
have
to
go
i
suppose
in
a
flowing
hand
i
wrote
as
follows
and
pleydell
have
much
pleasure
in
accepting
the
countess
of
loganberry
kind
invitation
to
attend
professor
la
trobe
lecture
on
the
of
when
i
had
read
this
aloud
what
an
interesting
subject
said
berry
we
shall
enjoy
ourselves
three
days
later
i
was
in
the
act
of
fitting
a
new
blade
to
my
when
berry
entered
the
room
fully
dressed
i
just
off
he
said
but
you
may
as
well
see
what
you
done
before
i
go
what
mean
said
i
read
that
he
handed
me
a
letter
i
laid
down
my
instrument
of
torture
and
read
as
follows
am
directed
by
the
countess
of
loganberry
to
acknowledge
your
communication
of
the
and
to
say
that
she
can
not
recollect
the
inclusion
of
your
name
among
those
of
the
guests
invited
to
assemble
at
pride
langley
the
day
after
these
circumstances
i
am
to
express
the
hope
that
you
will
not
trouble
to
favour
her
with
your
attendance
upon
the
inst
or
any
other
date
and
that
you
will
take
immediate
steps
to
prevent
the
dispatch
of
your
luggage
and
of
the
four
parasites
for
which
should
they
arrive
she
can
accept
no
am
to
add
that
the
countess
is
not
interested
in
the
acquisition
of
the
animal
to
which
you
refer
or
in
the
nature
of
the
victuals
with
which
it
is
your
habit
to
console
yourself
of
am
sir
obedient
servant
i
stroked
my
chin
thoughtfully
then
i
do
want
to
say
anything
rash
said
i
but
it
looks
as
if
a
mistake
had
been
made
but
what
a
brain
observed
my
what
insight
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
it
not
nine
yet
it
is
wonderful
is
it
now
all
we
want
is
a
line
from
diana
martin
to
say
how
glad
she
is
you
going
to
the
lecture
on
january
the
do
you
agree
brother
i
am
not
here
said
berry
loftily
to
discuss
your
crime
have
you
anything
to
say
why
the
court
should
not
give
you
judgment
yes
first
this
communication
must
be
answered
forthwith
secondly
boleton
is
clearly
a
menace
to
society
it
is
therefore
our
painful
duty
brother
to
proceed
with
the
operation
inadvertently
begun
of
pulling
his
leg
until
he
will
require
a
pair
of
field
glasses
to
see
his
own
foot
with
a
grin
berry
clapped
me
on
the
back
i
leave
it
to
you
partner
make
the
telegram
windy
wind
always
inspires
wind
he
took
the
letter
out
of
my
hand
and
slipped
it
into
his
pocket
you
wo
want
this
document
and
now
i
must
be
going
see
you
laddie
the
next
moment
he
was
gone
within
the
hour
the
following
telegram
was
on
its
way
to
pride
langley
letter
not
understood
aaa
can
not
consent
to
cancel
my
arrangements
at
this
hour
aaa
expect
me
tomorrow
as
arranged
aaa
four
tons
of
luggage
entrained
last
night
aaa
containing
parasites
due
to
arrive
at
aaa
imperative
these
should
be
watered
and
fed
within
one
hour
of
arrival
aaa
although
the
train
had
yet
to
make
its
appearance
the
platform
was
crowded
somewhere
at
the
far
end
jonah
was
waiting
to
see
that
our
heavy
baggage
was
placed
in
the
van
while
daphne
jill
and
i
were
standing
beside
such
articles
as
we
were
proposing
to
take
in
the
carriage
hoping
feverishly
that
when
the
train
pulled
in
we
should
find
ourselves
opposite
to
a
coach
thath
a
nithe
dog
said
an
unpleasant
voice
on
my
left
i
turned
to
see
a
very
dark
gentleman
clad
in
a
light
tweed
overcoat
and
boots
with
a
soft
grey
hat
on
the
back
of
his
head
smoking
an
insanitary
cigar
and
smiling
unctuously
upon
nobby
who
was
tucked
under
my
arm
yes
i
said
a
thealyham
ai
he
i
believe
so
undeterred
by
my
evident
reluctance
to
converse
the
fellow
bowed
his
head
as
if
to
examine
the
dog
at
the
same
time
expelling
a
cloud
of
disgusting
smoke
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
terrier
had
sneezed
wriggled
from
under
my
arm
and
slipped
to
the
ground
i
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
scuttle
in
the
direction
of
a
crate
of
live
turkeys
which
he
had
vainly
struggled
to
approach
when
we
passed
them
a
few
minutes
earlier
suppressing
a
violent
desire
to
choke
his
assailant
i
thrust
the
rug
i
was
carrying
into
jill
arms
and
started
to
elbow
my
way
towards
the
turkeys
a
sudden
stutter
of
barks
a
fearful
burst
of
gobbling
and
a
chorus
of
indignant
cries
suggested
that
the
sooner
i
arrived
to
take
charge
the
better
for
all
concerned
as
i
pushed
forward
the
press
swayed
expectantly
towards
the
edge
of
the
platform
and
i
glanced
round
to
see
the
train
pulling
in
thereafter
my
passage
to
the
scene
of
the
uproar
was
homeric
every
step
was
contested
not
actively
but
with
that
jealous
determination
not
to
yield
which
distinguishes
the
prospective
traveller
who
has
bought
an
expensive
ticket
and
by
no
means
certain
that
the
supply
of
seats
will
be
equal
to
the
demand
interprets
every
movement
as
an
attempt
to
secure
an
unfair
advantage
i
eventually
arrived
to
find
in
progress
a
game
which
i
prefer
not
to
describe
suffice
it
that
though
nobby
was
leading
two
inspectors
and
a
clergyman
with
an
umbrella
were
running
him
pretty
close
while
the
turkeys
were
simply
nowhere
with
a
dive
i
secured
the
terrier
just
as
he
evaded
a
left
hook
from
the
church
and
disregarding
the
loud
tones
in
which
several
intending
passengers
announced
their
conception
of
the
qualifications
of
a
fought
my
way
back
to
where
i
had
left
the
girls
the
fact
that
the
latter
had
managed
to
reserve
and
hold
four
seats
did
them
to
my
mind
infinite
credit
it
was
not
until
we
were
gliding
out
of
the
station
that
i
looked
round
for
my
i
did
so
in
vain
an
investigation
of
the
spaces
between
the
seats
and
the
floor
proved
equally
fruitless
i
sank
back
in
my
seat
with
a
groan
where
did
you
see
it
last
said
daphne
i
hanged
if
i
know
but
of
course
it
was
with
the
other
things
i
put
it
in
the
hall
last
night
and
falcon
knows
i
always
take
it
wherever
i
go
i
swear
nothing
was
left
on
the
platform
said
jill
nor
in
the
car
said
jonah
i
looked
there
myself
i
not
the
slightest
doubt
it
been
pinched
said
i
it
just
the
sort
of
thing
that
take
a
thief
fancy
by
jove
i
cried
suddenly
what
about
the
swab
in
the
light
coat
i
bet
any
money
he
took
it
what
swab
said
jonah
oh
a
complete
mobsman
came
and
jawed
about
nobby
and
then
gassed
him
with
his
cigar
till
he
did
a
bunk
that
put
me
out
of
the
way
with
the
girls
trying
to
get
a
carriage
the
rest
was
easy
gad
i
why
does
one
think
of
these
things
it
locked
and
there
nothing
terribly
valuable
in
it
but
i
do
hate
being
stung
first
stop
flail
said
jonah
looking
at
his
watch
you
got
the
best
part
of
two
hours
to
think
it
over
i
should
write
out
a
synopsis
of
the
crime
in
duplicate
with
a
description
of
the
missing
property
and
a
plan
of
the
station
i
suppose
showing
the
route
i
took
to
the
crate
of
turkeys
with
a
signed
photograph
of
nobby
i
only
got
to
attach
my
birth
certificate
and
there
you
are
gentleman
seems
annoyed
said
jonah
unfolding
the
jill
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
and
i
laughed
in
spite
of
myself
he
be
fed
to
the
teeth
when
he
gets
it
open
i
said
i
admit
the
cigars
are
not
what
he
accustomed
to
but
i
like
to
meet
the
fence
that
take
a
nainsook
pinafore
and
a
couple
of
bibs
this
comfortable
reflection
in
some
sort
consoled
me
all
the
same
when
we
steamed
into
flail
i
sent
for
the
and
handed
that
gentleman
two
short
descriptions
one
of
the
and
the
other
of
the
thief
he
promised
readily
to
keep
a
and
inform
the
police
an
i
telephone
down
the
line
sir
you
never
know
he
might
be
on
the
train
or
even
got
out
i
made
as
if
to
leave
the
compartment
ah
he
be
gone
by
now
an
you
just
off
but
i
do
what
i
can
your
address
red
abbey
very
good
sir
diana
martin
was
at
the
station
to
meet
us
in
a
fever
of
excitement
and
her
obvious
disappointment
at
berry
absence
was
allayed
by
our
assurance
that
he
would
appear
the
next
day
of
course
she
announced
i
was
thrilled
to
learn
that
you
were
going
to
the
loganberrys
lecture
but
i
could
help
feeling
that
there
was
some
news
more
relevant
to
your
visit
which
i
ought
to
know
hullo
is
he
going
to
honour
us
she
added
pointing
to
nobby
who
with
tail
erect
and
eyes
looking
sideways
was
considering
whether
or
no
to
accept
the
advances
of
an
irish
terrier
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
were
patently
offered
what
a
darling
if
you
please
said
i
splendid
and
now
come
along
we
can
all
get
in
the
limousine
and
there
a
van
for
your
luggage
during
the
drive
from
the
station
i
told
her
the
style
of
the
letter
she
should
have
received
and
disclosed
the
grave
construction
placed
upon
it
by
the
actual
recipient
when
i
told
her
that
boleton
and
i
were
now
in
telegraphic
communication
she
gave
a
little
crow
of
delight
how
priceless
she
cried
perhaps
there
be
a
wire
when
we
get
back
she
was
wrong
but
only
by
a
few
minutes
before
we
had
been
at
red
abbey
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
a
telegram
was
handed
to
me
falcon
had
forwarded
it
from
london
to
regard
your
conduct
as
molestful
delivery
of
your
luggage
will
not
be
accepted
parasites
will
remain
boxed
and
receive
necessary
attention
at
your
expense
and
risk
pending
instructions
regarding
their
removal
which
should
be
communicated
to
direct
any
attempt
on
your
part
to
enter
pride
langley
will
be
forcibly
at
once
i
arranged
for
the
dispatch
of
the
following
reply
great
inconvenience
have
arranged
to
postpone
arrival
of
luggage
and
parasites
until
aaa
impossible
however
to
stop
elephants
seven
of
which
should
reach
you
by
road
before
midnight
and
remainder
by
aaa
as
already
slated
am
unable
at
this
juncture
to
cancel
my
visit
but
shall
certainly
never
stay
at
pride
langley
again
aaa
if
molestful
means
what
i
think
it
does
i
shall
point
you
out
to
the
large
we
spent
a
hilarious
evening
the
irish
terrier
showed
nobby
that
hospitality
for
which
the
isle
is
famous
he
made
him
free
of
the
house
and
grounds
showed
him
the
way
to
the
kitchen
and
indicated
by
occupation
the
most
comfortable
chairs
nobby
returned
the
compliment
by
initiating
his
host
into
the
mysteries
of
a
game
which
consisted
of
making
a
circuit
of
the
great
hall
ascending
the
main
staircase
entering
and
erupting
from
any
bedroom
of
which
the
door
stood
open
and
descending
the
staircase
all
of
this
recurring
with
the
least
possible
delay
the
irish
terrier
proved
an
apt
pupil
and
so
far
as
can
be
judged
if
diana
maid
had
not
encountered
them
in
the
midst
of
their
seventh
descent
and
been
upset
and
of
vexation
nipped
by
an
angry
competitor
for
her
pains
the
game
might
have
gone
on
for
weeks
this
incident
however
followed
by
the
production
of
a
hunting
whip
brought
the
game
to
a
close
and
the
host
to
his
senses
hastily
he
repaired
a
grave
omission
and
a
moment
later
nobby
was
cowering
in
comparative
if
inconvenient
safety
beneath
an
enormous
tallboy
chest
after
dinner
cards
were
brought
forth
and
et
was
played
in
a
weak
moment
i
volunteered
to
carry
jill
who
played
with
an
which
was
at
once
exhilarating
and
extremely
expensive
her
persistent
refusal
to
stand
on
anything
less
than
commanded
an
admiration
which
but
for
my
presence
would
have
been
universal
the
only
run
of
luck
with
which
her
audacity
was
favoured
coincided
with
my
tenure
of
the
bank
during
which
period
she
took
shillings
off
me
in
seven
minutes
as
i
pushed
her
counters
across
i
heard
of
robbing
peter
to
pay
paul
i
said
gloomily
but
never
of
robbing
charlie
to
pay
chaplin
why
could
you
do
this
when
some
one
else
had
the
bank
you
should
deal
me
such
cards
was
the
ungrateful
reply
a
moment
later
she
turned
up
a
natural
with
a
dazzling
smile
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
of
course
this
is
berry
luck
said
i
and
it
needs
berry
tongue
to
cope
with
it
a
little
more
and
i
shall
ship
for
australia
before
the
mast
yes
i
have
a
please
of
appropriate
strength
in
inverse
proportion
to
your
luck
said
my
host
i
shook
my
head
that
would
require
berry
liver
besides
tomorrow
morning
i
going
to
help
your
wife
to
decorate
the
church
i
admit
i
was
a
fool
to
promise
but
it
done
now
and
the
chocolate
which
diana
threw
at
me
ricochetted
from
my
cheekbone
on
to
the
hearth
and
was
devoured
by
nobby
in
the
very
teeth
of
his
host
i
looked
at
my
watch
with
a
sigh
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
told
you
that
chocolates
fall
without
the
limit
of
his
digestive
powers
the
last
one
took
about
four
hours
and
it
eleven
now
i
am
glad
i
came
my
statement
was
received
with
ironical
cheers
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
the
chocolate
but
in
the
small
hours
of
the
following
morning
it
became
expedient
that
i
should
admit
nobby
into
the
open
air
and
so
it
came
about
that
i
stood
patient
and
shivering
in
a
fur
coat
and
pyjamas
at
a
garden
door
while
a
small
white
thing
heaved
upon
the
lawn
twelve
decent
yards
away
the
sailing
moon
issued
her
cold
white
light
and
showed
the
sleeping
country
silent
but
troubled
a
pride
of
clouds
rode
high
in
heaven
and
the
same
strong
careless
wind
that
bore
them
swept
from
the
leafless
boughs
of
earth
below
a
boisterous
melody
that
rose
and
fell
in
phrases
far
as
the
ear
could
follow
nature
was
in
a
royal
mood
her
cap
of
maintenance
was
out
pomp
was
abroad
the
trump
of
circumstance
was
sounding
a
frown
of
dignity
knitted
her
gentle
brow
and
meadows
roads
thickets
and
all
her
court
wore
a
staid
look
to
do
her
honour
only
her
favourite
water
dared
to
smile
and
the
flashing
lake
flung
back
the
moonlight
with
long
ripples
of
silvery
laughter
somewhere
close
at
hand
an
owl
cried
and
nobby
answered
the
challenge
with
a
menacing
bark
i
whistled
and
he
came
running
the
very
embodiment
of
health
and
spirits
marvelling
at
a
dog
recuperative
powers
i
reopened
the
door
as
i
did
so
i
heard
the
stable
clock
striking
three
twelve
hours
later
a
servant
entered
the
library
to
arouse
me
from
a
refreshing
sleep
with
the
news
that
some
one
desired
to
speak
with
me
upon
the
telephone
heavily
i
made
my
way
to
the
lobby
and
put
the
receiver
to
my
ear
but
the
first
sentence
i
heard
drove
the
lingering
rearguard
of
slumber
headlong
from
my
system
it
was
an
inspector
of
police
speaking
from
flail
i
think
we
got
your
case
sir
pigskin
seventeen
inches
by
ten
a
blue
line
runnin
acrost
it
that
right
i
said
excitedly
an
it
still
locked
no
initials
but
we
like
your
formal
identification
besides
i
do
know
whether
you
could
manage
this
afternoon
sir
but
if
you
could
you
see
it
a
matter
of
a
charge
we
detainin
a
man
in
connection
with
the
thef
oh
i
do
want
to
proceed
so
long
as
i
get
the
case
back
we
ca
do
that
sir
i
groaned
then
how
far
is
red
abbey
from
flail
matter
o
twelve
mile
sir
would
take
you
no
time
in
a
car
i
see
what
i
can
do
both
cars
were
needed
to
meet
incoming
guests
but
a
miss
doiran
who
had
arrived
that
morning
in
her
own
offered
to
drive
me
to
flail
and
back
before
tea
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
were
on
the
road
she
listened
attentively
to
the
story
of
my
loss
when
i
had
finished
you
little
enough
to
go
on
i
must
say
i
never
have
dared
to
say
that
man
had
stolen
it
it
was
a
bow
at
a
venture
i
admitted
but
it
seems
to
have
come
off
all
the
same
i
do
want
to
charge
the
chap
he
deserves
six
months
if
only
for
his
cigar
but
i
rather
somebody
else
sent
him
down
i
expect
they
make
you
after
all
it
was
a
pretty
smart
capture
and
the
police
be
fed
to
the
teeth
if
you
do
go
through
with
it
considering
it
was
stolen
in
london
i
did
see
any
sense
in
telling
the
police
at
flail
but
the
apparently
knew
his
job
with
a
temporarily
disengaged
hand
miss
doiran
caressed
nobby
who
was
seated
between
us
i
always
wanted
a
sealyham
she
sighed
you
could
have
had
one
for
nothing
at
three
this
morning
did
he
have
you
up
i
nodded
and
down
and
out
i
sighed
it
was
a
handsome
night
very
cold
though
i
thought
of
you
all
warm
in
bed
what
a
wicked
story
you
never
knew
of
my
existence
i
thought
of
everybody
that
embraced
you
it
extraordinary
how
little
women
can
wear
without
dying
of
exposure
is
it
miss
doiran
glanced
at
her
sleeve
this
coat
is
lined
with
chamois
leather
she
said
i
do
know
what
more
you
want
yes
but
your
stockings
are
when
you
stepped
into
the
car
i
was
quite
frightened
for
you
my
companion
chin
rose
and
she
stared
through
the
with
compressed
lips
i
as
warm
as
toast
she
said
defiantly
if
you
no
warmer
than
the
toast
i
had
for
breakfast
this
morning
you
should
get
up
earlier
i
thought
i
told
you
i
was
up
and
about
at
three
that
does
count
does
it
all
right
you
get
up
at
three
tomorrow
and
think
of
me
all
warm
in
bed
and
see
whether
it
counts
by
the
way
do
say
you
wear
pyjamas
because
i
ca
bear
it
miss
doiran
addressed
our
companion
is
he
often
like
this
nobby
i
explained
it
not
idle
curiosity
you
see
i
editing
a
directory
to
be
called
it
really
a
short
list
of
the
few
nice
people
left
who
are
anybody
with
just
a
word
or
two
about
their
manners
failings
virtues
if
any
and
the
attire
they
usually
affect
when
off
duty
it
wo
say
when
they
were
born
but
why
they
were
born
that
sell
it
said
miss
doiran
so
you
see
may
i
know
now
or
must
i
wait
outside
the
bathroom
i
afraid
said
miss
doiran
that
you
must
wait
outside
the
bathroom
i
sighed
if
it
is
pyjamas
said
i
i
shall
scream
some
geese
hissed
as
we
swept
by
the
noise
was
inaudible
but
the
hostility
of
their
gesture
was
patent
its
effect
upon
nobby
was
electrical
exasperated
to
madness
by
the
gratuitous
insult
he
made
the
most
violent
attempts
to
leave
the
car
only
pausing
the
better
to
lift
up
his
voice
and
rave
at
his
by
this
time
distant
tormentors
his
dignity
was
outraged
and
what
was
much
worse
unavenged
still
want
him
i
shouted
holding
fast
to
his
collar
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
i
strove
to
muffle
his
cries
with
the
rug
every
time
i
swallowed
before
replying
of
course
this
is
exceptional
i
said
weakly
he
can
be
very
good
if
he
likes
miss
doiran
laughed
i
believe
you
just
dote
on
him
i
lugged
the
white
scrap
out
of
the
welter
of
rug
and
set
him
up
on
my
knees
surprised
he
stopped
barking
and
looked
me
full
in
the
eyes
then
he
thrust
a
cold
nose
into
my
face
almost
roughly
i
put
him
away
i
believe
you
right
i
said
ten
minutes
later
we
drove
up
to
flail
police
station
i
thrust
nobby
under
my
arm
and
stepped
out
of
the
car
then
i
turned
to
the
girl
i
be
as
quick
as
i
can
i
said
right
oh
sure
enough
it
was
my
in
some
embarrassment
i
described
the
ridiculous
contents
then
i
produced
the
key
and
confirmed
my
own
words
i
must
say
i
said
you
have
wasted
much
time
how
did
you
recover
it
the
inspector
in
charge
looked
grave
a
nice
little
lot
what
took
this
case
sir
i
should
wonder
if
there
was
a
dozen
warrants
out
for
as
plausible
a
rogue
as
ever
i
see
an
as
full
o
swank
as
a
negg
is
o
meat
told
us
the
tale
proper
did
one
o
the
kind
as
gets
through
by
sheer
nerve
now
nine
out
o
ten
bin
through
this
case
last
night
and
throwed
it
away
but
not
that
sort
walks
through
the
town
this
afternoon
with
it
under
arm
as
bold
as
brass
a
man
entered
and
stood
waiting
all
ready
right
he
turned
again
to
me
an
now
sir
we
be
obliged
if
you
step
into
the
yard
and
see
if
you
see
anybody
you
recognize
i
like
the
identification
to
be
regular
perceiving
my
chance
of
doing
the
thief
a
good
turn
i
assented
readily
it
was
my
fixed
intention
to
recognize
no
one
i
followed
the
policeman
into
a
yard
variously
attired
six
men
were
drawn
up
in
line
do
you
see
anybody
you
know
repeated
the
inspector
i
did
third
from
the
left
with
a
seraphic
look
on
his
face
was
for
a
moment
i
stood
spellbound
then
i
began
to
laugh
uncontrollably
go
on
you
fool
said
berry
indicate
the
felon
i
admit
it
one
up
to
you
but
i
get
my
own
back
you
wait
why
there
kernobby
the
terrier
slipped
from
under
my
arm
and
ran
to
where
he
stood
good
dog
but
i
must
play
with
you
till
the
gentleman
in
blue
boxcloth
says
so
i
a
giddy
criminal
i
am
he
addressed
my
companion
will
you
dismiss
the
parade
inspector
or
shall
we
do
a
little
troop
drill
i
turned
to
the
bewildered
officer
it
all
a
mistake
inspector
this
is
my
he
must
have
borrowed
the
case
without
my
knowledge
for
goodness
sake
get
these
men
away
and
we
explain
things
the
inspector
hesitated
but
nobby
frantic
efforts
to
lick
the
suspect
face
settled
the
matter
gruffly
he
acted
upon
my
suggestion
and
the
little
squad
broke
up
in
the
we
satisfied
him
of
the
sincerity
of
our
statements
and
exonerated
him
from
blame
to
do
the
police
justice
berry
was
dressed
more
or
less
in
accordance
with
my
hazy
description
of
the
thief
and
it
was
my
courtesies
were
exchanged
i
signed
a
receipt
for
my
property
and
berry
his
effects
restored
gave
a
poor
devil
who
was
brought
in
to
be
charged
with
begging
enough
to
console
the
latter
for
his
detention
on
christmas
day
a
moment
later
i
was
introducing
him
to
miss
doiran
thief
and
in
one
i
said
a
terrible
combination
berry
took
off
his
hat
and
put
a
hand
to
his
head
whose
reign
is
it
he
said
dazedly
when
i
entered
the
gaol
it
was
king
george
with
his
back
to
the
fire
in
daphne
bedroom
berry
proceeded
to
clear
the
air
if
any
one
of
you
four
had
a
tenth
of
the
instinct
of
a
village
idiot
it
would
have
occurred
to
those
diseased
fungi
which
you
call
your
minds
that
i
had
said
i
should
want
boy
but
let
that
pass
i
was
walking
through
flail
according
to
plan
and
following
the
according
to
the
drivelling
advice
given
me
by
an
outside
porter
with
a
suggestive
nose
need
i
say
that
before
i
had
covered
a
hundred
yards
the
lines
branched
i
was
still
praying
for
the
soul
of
my
informant
when
i
observed
that
a
large
blue
constable
who
was
apparently
lining
the
street
was
staring
at
me
as
at
an
apparition
courteously
i
gave
him
day
in
return
he
handed
me
a
look
which
i
shall
try
to
forget
and
asked
me
how
i
came
by
the
did
i
said
came
by
train
noticing
that
he
seemed
piqued
by
my
reply
i
made
haste
to
suggest
that
we
should
repair
to
a
neighbouring
dairy
and
consume
two
small
glasses
of
butter
milk
and
a
sponge
cake
at
my
expense
not
to
be
outdone
in
hospitality
he
made
a
which
after
some
hesitation
i
thought
it
discreet
to
accept
our
progress
through
the
streets
afforded
the
acme
of
gratification
to
the
populace
most
of
whom
accompanied
us
with
every
circumstance
of
enthusiasm
and
delight
altogether
it
was
most
exhilarating
my
reception
at
the
was
cordial
in
the
extreme
they
told
me
their
theory
and
i
gave
them
my
explanation
the
fact
that
the
beastly
case
was
still
locked
was
naturally
in
my
favour
in
fact
everything
in
the
garden
was
lovely
and
i
was
on
the
point
of
pushing
off
to
catch
my
train
when
that
fool
of
an
inspector
asked
if
i
leave
my
card
as
a
matter
of
form
afraid
i
have
one
on
me
i
said
i
daresay
i
got
an
envelope
and
i
started
to
feel
in
my
pockets
there
was
only
one
paper
there
and
that
was
an
envelope
was
boleton
the
moment
i
saw
what
it
was
i
knew
i
was
done
i
could
put
it
away
or
they
get
suspicious
if
i
showed
it
them
they
regard
me
as
a
crook
and
very
big
game
i
suppose
i
hesitated
for
the
inspector
leaned
forward
and
took
it
out
of
my
hand
the
rest
was
easy
i
was
reviled
searched
cautioned
examined
measured
described
and
finally
told
that
i
should
be
detained
pending
inquiries
i
was
then
immured
in
a
dungeon
which
to
judge
from
its
atmosphere
had
been
recently
occupied
by
an
and
from
its
condition
not
yet
reached
by
the
chambermaid
yes
he
concluded
you
have
before
you
the
complete
how
did
you
spend
your
time
said
jonah
my
wings
against
the
crool
said
berry
my
flutterings
were
most
painful
several
turnkeys
broke
down
the
rat
which
was
attached
to
me
for
pay
and
rations
gambolled
to
assuage
my
grief
greatly
affected
by
the
little
animal
antics
i
mounted
the
plank
bed
and
rang
the
for
the
in
due
course
they
appeared
full
of
the
feet
of
a
gigantic
warder
i
told
him
that
i
had
not
ordered
vermin
and
should
prefer
a
fire
and
asked
if
they
mind
if
i
did
dress
for
dinner
i
added
that
i
thought
flowers
always
improved
a
cell
and
would
he
buy
me
some
white
carnations
and
a
his
reply
was
evasive
and
so
coarse
that
i
told
the
rat
not
to
listen
and
recited
what
i
could
remember
of
lost
chord
he
turned
to
me
the
remainder
of
my
time
i
occupied
in
making
plans
for
the
disposal
of
your
corpse
you
only
yourself
to
thank
said
i
you
should
have
borrowed
the
goods
i
acted
in
good
faith
i
wonder
said
berry
where
one
gets
quicklime
it
was
during
the
interval
between
the
third
and
fourth
dances
both
of
which
had
been
given
me
by
miss
doiran
that
the
latter
consulted
her
programme
i
dancing
the
fifth
she
announced
with
the
duke
of
blackpool
i
started
violently
but
she
took
no
notice
i
think
you
know
him
he
was
released
from
prison
this
afternoon
as
my
aunt
secretary
i
had
some
correspondence
with
him
under
the
name
of
boleton
my
brain
began
to
work
furiously
i
scent
collusion
i
said
diana
is
in
this
miss
doiran
laughed
she
rang
me
up
directly
she
got
your
note
about
the
lecture
the
rest
sort
of
came
natural
i
believe
you
were
responsible
for
the
telegrams
i
congratulate
you
the
elephants
were
a
my
aunt
was
tickled
to
death
by
them
how
dreadful
i
mean
it
very
nice
of
her
i
afraid
it
was
all
rather
impertinent
if
so
we
were
the
first
to
offend
and
after
all
major
pleydell
has
expiated
his
crime
and
he
fixed
my
murder
for
the
first
week
in
january
there
really
only
you
left
oh
i
punished
already
said
miss
doiran
i
lost
my
heart
and
he
does
love
me
would
it
be
indiscreet
to
ask
his
name
miss
doiran
looked
round
the
room
when
i
last
saw
him
she
said
he
was
talking
to
an
irish
terrier
chapter
v
how
jill
education
was
improved
and
daphne
gave
her
husband
the
slip
as
i
have
frequently
observed
said
berry
your
education
has
been
neglected
i
not
blaming
those
responsible
your
instruction
must
have
been
a
thankless
task
i
should
think
the
masters
who
taught
you
enjoyed
their
holidays
such
a
reply
from
jill
was
like
a
sudden
snowstorm
in
june
and
berry
who
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
choked
with
surprise
when
he
had
recovered
his
breath
you
rude
child
he
said
my
prizes
are
among
my
most
cherished
possessions
where
keep
them
suspiciously
chancery
lane
safe
deposit
was
the
reply
when
i
die
i
shall
leave
them
to
the
wallace
collection
the
shoes
i
wore
at
the
first
night
of
are
already
promised
to
the
imperial
institute
when
you
quite
finished
said
daphne
i
suggest
that
we
go
up
for
the
day
on
friday
i
do
mean
but
the
one
after
it
a
little
early
in
the
year
said
i
all
the
same
there
no
reason
why
we
should
go
up
again
later
on
it
always
open
if
the
weather
holds
said
jonah
it
will
be
looking
wonderful
oxford
some
reference
had
been
made
to
the
city
while
we
sat
at
dessert
and
in
the
midst
of
a
banana
jill
had
confessed
that
she
had
never
been
there
the
rest
of
us
knew
the
place
well
berry
had
been
at
magdalen
jonah
at
new
college
and
i
had
fleeted
four
fat
years
carelessly
as
a
member
of
the
house
but
while
my
sister
had
spent
many
hours
there
during
my
residence
jill
had
not
once
visited
her
brother
largely
no
doubt
because
there
was
a
disparity
of
six
years
in
her
favour
between
their
ages
i
warn
you
said
berry
that
i
may
break
down
my
return
to
the
haunts
of
early
innocence
may
be
too
much
for
me
yes
he
added
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
i
were
to
beat
my
breast
somewhere
near
the
martyrs
memorial
an
appropriate
locality
said
jonah
if
my
memory
serves
me
it
was
for
a
crime
committed
almost
under
the
shadow
of
that
monument
that
you
were
irrevocably
sent
down
berry
selected
a
cigar
before
replying
then
only
a
malignant
reptile
would
refer
to
that
miscarriage
of
justice
it
was
not
my
fault
that
the
animal
which
i
employed
exceeded
its
instructions
and
as
it
were
pushed
on
after
attaining
its
objective
you
expected
it
to
consolidate
the
position
said
i
precisely
to
dig
itself
in
it
was
like
this
it
was
expedient
no
matter
why
that
a
large
boar
should
be
introduced
into
balliol
college
shortly
before
a
gigantic
specimen
was
accordingly
procured
and
brought
to
the
broad
street
entrance
in
a
hansom
cab
it
was
then
induced
to
take
up
a
position
commanding
the
the
juxtaposition
of
two
hurdles
held
in
place
by
my
subordinates
frustrated
any
attempt
at
untimely
evacuation
at
a
given
signal
the
customary
kick
was
administered
to
the
gate
indicating
that
some
person
or
persons
sought
admission
to
the
foundation
unhesitatingly
the
porter
responded
to
the
summons
the
wicket
was
opened
and
the
pig
passed
in
i
think
it
was
very
cruel
said
daphne
not
at
all
said
her
husband
there
was
more
succulent
grass
upon
the
lawns
of
balliol
than
was
dreamt
of
in
its
ferocity
to
continue
my
mission
accomplished
i
entered
the
hansom
and
drove
to
the
club
it
was
during
an
unfortunate
altercation
with
the
cabman
who
demanded
an
unreasonably
exorbitant
sum
for
the
conveyance
of
the
pig
that
i
was
accosted
by
a
proctor
for
being
gownless
the
cab
was
still
redolent
of
its
late
occupant
and
although
nothing
was
said
at
the
time
it
was
this
which
afterwards
led
the
authorities
to
suspect
my
complicity
even
so
nothing
would
have
been
said
but
for
a
most
distressing
development
i
had
expected
that
the
pig
would
confine
its
attention
to
the
quadrangles
and
gardens
and
to
startling
such
members
of
the
college
as
happened
casually
to
encounter
it
fate
however
decreed
otherwise
it
appears
that
the
creature
admission
coincided
with
the
opening
of
a
door
which
led
directly
into
the
senior
common
room
where
the
master
and
fellows
were
still
discussing
classical
criticism
and
some
port
attracted
by
the
shaft
of
light
and
the
mellow
atmosphere
of
good
cheer
and
hilarity
which
streamed
into
the
comparative
gloom
of
the
quadrangle
the
pig
made
a
for
the
doorway
and
a
moment
later
the
exclusive
circle
was
enriched
by
the
presence
of
this
simple
and
unaffected
guest
the
details
of
what
followed
have
never
transpired
but
from
the
senior
proctor
demeanour
at
a
subsequent
interview
and
the
amount
of
the
bill
for
damage
which
i
was
requested
to
pay
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
pig
must
have
been
a
confirmed
bolshevist
i
hope
you
apologized
to
the
master
i
did
i
received
in
reply
a
letter
which
i
shall
always
value
it
ran
as
follows
beg
that
you
will
think
no
more
of
the
matter
youth
must
be
served
many
years
ago
i
assisted
your
father
in
a
somewhat
similar
enterprise
till
the
other
evening
i
had
always
believed
that
the
havoc
provoked
by
the
introduction
of
a
dancing
bear
into
a
could
not
be
surpassed
i
am
now
less
very
faithfully
i
think
said
jill
he
was
very
forgiving
it
was
deep
said
berry
calling
to
deep
by
the
way
you
all
be
pleased
to
hear
that
i
have
received
peremptory
instructions
one
week
to
abolish
the
existing
number
by
which
this
house
is
distinguished
and
to
mark
or
affix
on
some
conspicuous
part
thereof
a
new
number
and
to
renew
the
same
as
often
as
it
is
obliterated
or
defaced
selah
whatever
said
daphne
do
you
mean
sorry
said
berry
let
me
put
it
another
way
some
genii
masquerading
as
officials
have
got
a
move
on
snuffing
the
air
of
they
have
realized
with
a
shock
that
the
numbers
of
the
houses
in
this
street
have
not
been
changed
for
over
half
a
century
thirstily
they
have
determined
to
repair
the
omission
we
always
been
in
a
few
days
with
apologies
to
wordsworth
we
shall
be
a
solemn
thought
but
can
we
do
nothing
certainly
in
that
case
somebody
else
will
obliterate
the
existing
number
and
i
shall
be
summoned
to
appear
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
it
outrageous
said
daphne
it
cause
endless
confusion
and
think
of
all
our
notepaper
and
cards
all
the
dies
will
have
to
be
scrapped
and
new
ones
cut
go
easy
said
i
after
a
decent
interval
they
alter
the
name
of
the
street
many
people
feel
that
the
quadrant
should
be
renamed
salient
and
piccadilly
street
i
all
for
progress
is
this
renumbering
stunt
a
fact
said
jonah
or
are
you
just
being
funny
it
a
poisonous
but
fact
said
berry
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
we
pay
rates
and
taxes
for
give
me
germany
ca
we
refuse
i
rung
up
merry
and
merry
and
they
looked
up
the
law
and
say
there
no
appeal
we
are
at
the
mercy
of
some
official
who
came
out
top
in
algebra
in
and
has
never
recovered
let
us
be
thankful
it
geography
otherwise
we
should
be
required
to
name
this
house
or
permit
me
to
remark
that
the
port
has
now
remained
opposite
you
for
exactly
four
minutes
of
time
for
three
of
which
my
goblet
has
been
empty
i
think
it
cruel
said
jill
passing
on
the
decanter
i
think
hush
said
berry
that
wonderful
organ
my
brain
is
working
rapidly
he
began
to
write
upon
the
back
of
a
we
must
inform
the
world
through
the
medium
of
the
press
an
attractive
paragraph
must
appear
in
what
could
be
more
appropriate
than
an
epitaph
ply
me
with
wine
child
the
sage
is
in
labour
with
a
song
jill
filled
his
glass
and
he
drank
another
instant
and
you
shall
hear
the
deathless
words
i
always
felt
i
should
be
buried
in
the
abbey
anybody
give
me
a
rhyme
for
no
it
does
matter
i
have
ingeniously
circumvented
the
crisis
he
added
one
line
held
the
card
at
arm
length
regarded
it
as
a
painter
a
canvas
sighed
and
began
to
read
painful
tale
i
must
relate
we
used
to
live
at
but
as
we
hope
to
go
to
heaven
we
come
to
live
at
number
seven
now
if
we
lived
at
number
nine
i
got
a
simply
priceless
line
i
did
want
to
drag
in
heaven
but
nothing
else
will
rhyme
with
soldier
mountebank
and
rhymester
too
said
jonah
and
yet
we
breathe
the
same
air
i
admit
it
strange
said
my
but
it
was
foretold
by
my
predecessor
i
think
you
find
the
prophecy
in
the
wholesome
berries
thrive
and
ripen
best
neighboured
by
fruit
of
baser
quality
my
game
i
think
what
as
was
fitting
george
day
dawned
fair
and
cloudless
her
passionate
weeping
of
the
day
before
dismissed
april
was
smiling
shyly
at
first
as
if
uncertain
that
her
recent
waywardness
had
been
forgiven
and
by
and
by
so
bravely
that
all
the
sweet
o
the
year
rose
up
out
of
the
snowy
orchards
dewy
and
odorous
danced
in
the
gleaming
meadows
and
hung
glowing
and
breathless
in
every
swaying
nursery
that
spring
had
once
more
built
upon
the
patient
trees
the
rolls
sailed
through
the
country
proudly
indifferent
to
hill
or
dale
melting
the
leagues
to
miles
with
such
swift
deadliness
as
made
you
sorry
for
the
lean
old
road
that
once
had
been
so
much
to
reckon
with
i
was
on
the
point
of
communicating
this
quixotic
reflection
to
agatha
deriot
who
was
seated
in
front
between
jill
and
myself
when
there
fell
upon
my
reluctant
ears
that
heavy
sigh
which
only
an
expiring
tire
can
heave
as
i
slowed
up
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
puissance
of
the
roads
of
england
was
still
considerable
which
is
it
said
agatha
off
hind
i
fancy
we
were
in
the
midst
of
a
pleasant
beechwood
and
i
pulled
in
to
the
side
of
the
road
with
a
grunt
if
it
had
to
be
it
might
have
happened
in
a
less
pleasing
locality
i
gather
said
berry
voice
i
gather
that
something
untoward
has
befallen
the
automobile
should
i
be
wrong
correct
me
and
explain
the
stoppage
with
that
singular
clarity
of
intellect
which
never
fails
to
recognize
the
obvious
you
have
correctly
diagnosed
the
case
we
have
picked
up
a
puncture
speak
for
yourself
said
berry
i
always
let
them
lie
i
did
gather
a
bunch
of
bursts
once
but
sorry
said
i
i
forgot
how
near
we
were
to
oxford
what
i
meant
was
that
some
hostile
body
of
a
sharp
nature
had
penetrated
a
tire
thus
untimely
releasing
the
air
hitherto
therein
confined
thank
you
said
berry
experience
leads
me
to
anticipate
a
slight
delay
the
while
you
effect
the
necessary
repairs
i
shall
therefore
compose
myself
to
slumber
and
meditation
possibly
i
shall
toy
with
a
cigarette
possibly
your
programme
will
i
fear
miscarry
for
more
than
one
reason
in
the
first
place
you
sitting
on
the
jack
in
the
second
place
clumsy
fool
though
you
are
jonah
can
change
the
wheel
quicker
if
you
help
him
with
that
i
climbed
out
of
the
driver
seat
and
lighted
a
cigarette
who
i
added
will
come
for
a
little
walk
i
coming
said
daphne
setting
aside
the
rug
and
rising
from
her
seat
between
jonah
and
her
husband
i
forbid
you
said
the
latter
to
consort
with
that
blasphemous
viper
my
sister
leaned
down
and
kissed
him
a
little
gentle
exercise
she
said
will
do
you
good
i
expect
make
you
hot
so
take
your
coat
off
then
you
have
something
to
put
on
again
coldly
berry
regarded
her
how
long
he
said
did
it
take
you
to
work
that
out
as
we
strolled
down
the
road
in
the
wake
of
miss
deriot
and
jill
i
turned
and
looked
back
at
the
car
something
was
squatting
on
the
tarmac
close
to
the
petrol
tank
the
fact
that
jonah
was
unstrapping
a
spare
wheel
suggested
that
my
was
taking
exercise
my
sister
slid
an
arm
through
mine
and
we
walked
idly
on
the
road
curled
out
of
the
wood
into
the
unchecked
sunlight
rising
to
where
its
flashing
hedgerows
fell
back
ten
paces
each
leaving
a
fair
green
ride
on
either
side
of
the
highway
here
jacketed
elms
made
up
a
stately
colonnade
ready
to
nod
their
gay
green
crests
at
each
stray
touch
and
throwing
broad
equidistant
bars
of
shadow
across
the
fresh
turf
and
the
still
moist
ribbon
of
metalling
beyond
two
piles
of
stones
lay
heaped
upon
the
sward
and
as
we
drew
near
we
heard
the
busy
chink
of
a
hammer
a
melodious
sound
that
fitted
both
morning
and
venue
to
perfection
again
i
fell
to
thinking
on
the
old
coach
road
the
was
an
old
old
man
but
the
tone
in
which
he
gave
us
good
day
was
blithe
and
good
to
hear
while
he
looked
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
you
work
very
fast
said
i
as
he
reached
for
a
mammoth
flint
aye
he
said
but
it
come
easy
sir
after
so
many
year
have
you
always
done
this
said
daphne
the
old
fellow
plucked
the
gauze
from
his
brow
and
touched
his
battered
hat
naught
else
m
year
come
michaelmas
i
kep
the
oxford
road
an
me
father
before
me
that
a
wonderful
record

i
amazedly
and

your
years

many
as

me
that
i
be
in
the
month
o
june

sir
that
no
shame
said
i
tell
me
you
must
remember
the
coaches
that
do
i
they
was
took
off
my
road
just
afore
i
started
meself
but
long
afore
that
i
used
to
bring
me
father

an
i
remember
them
well
many
a
time
i
watched
the
go
by
muster
cracknell
drivin
always
nodded
to

an
passed
the
time
o
day
an
father

an
call
me
an
tell
me

an
what
a
fine
coachman
were
was
a

the
but
muster
cracknell
used
to
over
at
oxford
london
to
oxford
was
stretch
sir
an
back
is
that
wonderful
said
daphne
agatha
and
jill
who
had
joined
us
agreed
in
awestruck
whispers
the
old
fellow
laughed
i
seen
the
coaches
m
and
i
seen
the
motors
an
they
neither
of
them
do
without
the
road
m
as
it
was
in
the
beginnin
so
ever
it
shall
be
soon
i
pass
but
the
road
go
on
an
break
for
for
she
must
needs
be
patched
you
know
m
she
must
needs
be
patched
we
gave
him
money
and
he
rose
and
uncovered
and
pulled
his
white
forelock
with
the
antique
courtesy
of
his
class
as
we
turned
away
i
pinched
daphne
arm
i
bet
no
man
ever
done
that
to
you
before
she
shook
her
head
smiling
i
do
think
so
it
was
very
nice
of
him
what
would
you
call
him
said
jill
a
i
raised
my
eyebrows
i
suppose
so
or
roadman
i
know
said
agatha
softly
he
a
gentleman
of
the
road
good
for
you
said
i
the
title
never
became
a
highwayman
one
half
so
well
as
i
spoke
the
rolls
stole
up
alongside
we
climbed
in
jill
and
i
sitting
behind
for
a
change
with
a
foot
on
the
step
daphne
looked
at
her
husband
did
you
get
very
hot
she
said
i
did
said
berry
every
pore
in
my
body
has
been
in
action
i
always
think
it
so
nice
to
start
a
day
like
that
how
would
you
like
to
break
stones
said
i
for
years
jonah
let
in
the
clutch
i
perceive
said
berry
that
you
are
under
the
influence
of
drink
at
the
present
moment
i
am
more
interested
in
the
breaking
of
backs
have
you
ever
jacked
up
a
car
often
you
must
stoop
to
conquer
stoop
you
must
have
a
comic
spine
my
trunk
kept
getting
in
the
way
and
my
nether
limbs
were
superfluous
to
do
it
properly
you
should
be
severed
below
the
armpits
the
correct
way
said
i
is
to
face
the
jack
and
then
bend
backwards
till
you
face
it
again
then
it
simplicity
itself
you
work
as
it
were
between
your
own
legs
my
sighed
i
used
to
do
my
boots
up
like
that
when
an
agent
in
germany
in
that
way
no
one
could
assault
me
from
behind
those
detailed
to
stab
me
in
the
back
were
nonplussed
and
in
several
cases
shot
for
incompetence
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
slid
over
magdalen
bridge
the
venerable
city
was
unchanged
that
same
peculiar
dignity
which
no
impertinence
can
scathe
that
same
abiding
peace
the
handiwork
of
labouring
centuries
that
immemorial
youth
which
drains
the
cups
of
time
and
pays
no
reckoning
three
wonders
of
the
world
rose
up
to
meet
us
visitors
oxford
has
but
two
moods
this
day
she
was
the
sunshine
holyday
of
spring
had
won
her
from
her
other
soberer
state
and
mirth
was
in
all
her
ways
her
busy
streets
were
bright
her
blistered
walls
glowed
and
gave
back
the
warmth
vouchsafed
them
her
spires
and
towers
were
glancing
vivid
against
the
blue
the
unexpected
green
that
sprawled
ragged
upon
scaly
parapets
thrust
boldly
out
between
the
reverend
mansions
and
smothered
up
the
songs
of
architects
trembled
to
meet
its
patron
the
blowing
meadows
beamed
gates
lifted
up
their
heads
retired
quadrangles
smiled
in
their
sleep
the
very
streams
were
lazy
and
gardens
walks
spaces
and
alleyed
lanes
were
all
betimes
perhaps
because
it
was
george
day
ghosts
that
the
grey
old
stones
can
conjure
up
at
fancy
whim
came
thronging
the
state
of
kings
rode
by
familiar
shrewd
virgin
majesty
swayed
in
a
litter
down
the
roaring
streets
and
the
unruly
pomp
of
a
proud
cardinal
wended
its
scarlet
way
past
kneeling
citizens
cavaliers
ruffled
it
in
the
chequered
walks
prelates
and
sages
loaded
the
patient
air
with
discourse
and
phantom
tuck
of
drum
ushered
a
soldiery
to
emptied
bursaries
with
measured
tread
statesmen
and
scholars
paced
sober
up
and
down
the
flags
absorbed
in
argument
poets
roamed
absent
by
and
law
and
bustling
physic
learned
and
gowned
and
big
with
dignity
swept
in
and
out
the
gates
of
colleges
whose
very
fame
that
spurred
their
young
intent
they
lived
to
magnify
after
a
random
drive
about
the
city
in
the
course
of
which
we
visited
john
and
magdalen
we
put
the
car
in
a
garage
and
repaired
to
for
lunch
such
other
spectacles
as
we
proposed
to
view
lay
more
or
less
close
together
and
could
be
inspected
more
conveniently
without
the
car
which
claimed
the
constant
vigilance
of
one
of
us
just
at
the
very
times
we
least
could
spare
it
fortified
by
the
deference
shown
him
by
his
scout
whom
we
had
encountered
while
visiting
his
old
rooms
overlooking
the
deer
park
my
had
in
some
measure
succeeded
so
far
as
jill
and
agatha
were
concerned
in
investing
his
sojourn
at
magdalen
with
an
dignity
and
daphne
jonah
and
i
were
quite
justifiably
delighted
when
a
individual
with
a
slip
in
his
waistcoat
and
a
diamond
ring
left
his
table
and
laid
a
fat
hand
familiarly
upon
shoulder
hullo
pleydell
old
man
how
things
do
remember
me
i
suppose
lewis
he
mentioned
the
name
of
the
minor
college
he
had
once
adorned
you
were
at
magdalen
were
you
taken
completely
by
surprise
berry
hesitated
before
replying
in
a
tone
which
would
have
chilled
a
glacier
er
yes
i
afraid
my
memory
not
as
good
as
yours
you
must
excuse
me
that
all
right
said
the
other
with
a
fat
laugh
i
was
one
of
the
quiet
little
mice
he
added
archly
and
you
were
always
such
a
gay
dog
to
our
indescribable
delectation
he
actually
thrust
a
stubby
forefinger
into
his
victim
ribs
er
yes
said
berry
moving
his
chair
as
far
from
his
tormentor
as
space
would
permit
i
suppose
you
were
one
of
the
mice
i
think
you
said
you
know
i
still
do
seem
to
remember
your
face
or
name
quite
sure
anno
domini
was
the
cheerful
reply
we
both
older
eh
do
you
remember
the
night
we
all
but
i
ought
to
tell
tales
out
of
school
ought
i
old
bean
again
the
forefinger
was
employed
and
its
owner
looked
round
expectantly
beads
of
perspiration
became
visible
upon
berry
forehead
and
jonah
and
i
burst
into
a
roar
of
laughter
greatly
encouraged
by
our
mirth
lewis
beamed
with
geniality
and
slapping
berry
upon
the
back
with
the
diamond
ring
commended
the
good
old
times
observed
that
the
undergraduates
of
were
of
a
very
different
class
to
me
and
you
and
added
that
england
was
in
such
a
rotten
state
that
if
the
coal
controller
had
not
personally
begged
him
to
carry
on
he
would
have
up
stick
and
cleared
out
to
australia
long
ago
at
his
concluding
words
daphne
sat
up
as
if
she
had
been
shot
then
administering
to
me
a
kick
which
she
afterwards
explained
had
been
intended
for
berry
she
smiled
very
charmingly
i
suppose
you
just
up
for
the
day
lewis
as
we
are
she
inquired
with
an
elaborate
bow
lewis
agreed
and
in
a
moment
the
two
were
carrying
on
an
absurd
conversation
to
which
jonah
and
i
contributed
by
laughing
unfeignedly
whenever
a
remark
justified
an
expression
of
mirth
jill
and
agatha
were
on
the
edge
of
hysteria
and
berry
sat
sunk
in
a
condition
of
profound
gloom
from
which
he
occasionally
emerged
to
fix
one
or
other
of
us
with
a
stare
of
such
malevolence
as
only
served
to
throw
us
into
a
fresh
paroxysm
of
laughter
had
lewis
for
one
moment
appreciated
the
true
cause
of
our
amusement
he
would
have
been
a
broken
man
happily
his
was
sublime
and
when
daphne
finally
bowed
and
remarked
with
a
dazzling
smile
that
no
doubt
he
and
her
husband
would
like
to
have
a
little
chat
after
luncheon
he
retired
in
a
perfect
ecstasy
of
gratification
when
he
was
out
of
earshot
why
not
ask
him
to
come
and
live
with
us
said
berry
he
could
go
to
the
loganberrys
ball
on
tuesday
and
jonah
and
i
can
put
him
up
for
the
club
he
might
even
stay
for
ascot
i
think
he
a
topper
said
i
old
college
pal
i
suppose
said
jonah
let
call
the
stilton
after
him
listen
said
daphne
did
you
hear
him
say
he
was
something
to
do
with
coal
well
the
moment
he
said
it
i
thought
of
what
i
been
trying
to
remember
ever
since
yesterday
morning
we
got
three
hundredweight
left
and
we
had
more
than
our
ration
already
for
goodness
sake
get
him
to
do
something
for
us
you
wicked
woman
said
berry
you
wicked
deceitful
woman
nonsense
said
daphne
it
just
a
stroke
of
luck
of
course
he
may
be
able
to
help
but
it
worth
trying
if
you
want
to
do
without
a
hot
bath
let
alone
fires
for
the
next
three
months
i
do
and
i
am
to
be
the
said
berry
i
to
have
the
felicity
of
hobnobbing
with
that
poisonous
bounder
you
done
it
before
said
i
he
remembers
it
perfectly
vermin
said
berry
you
lie
my
association
with
that
little
pet
was
confined
to
the
two
solitary
occasions
upon
which
i
was
so
misguided
as
to
be
the
guest
of
a
club
of
which
he
was
not
a
member
but
which
was
nevertheless
an
institution
of
the
college
which
he
adorned
after
dinner
it
was
customary
to
pay
a
short
but
eventful
visit
to
the
rooms
of
the
most
unpopular
man
in
college
on
each
occasion
lewis
rooms
were
unanimously
selected
nemesis
said
i
he
getting
his
own
back
i
rejoice
to
think
said
my
that
it
was
i
who
conceived
the
idea
of
secreting
chinese
figs
in
every
pair
of
his
boots
and
shoes
that
could
be
found
if
i
remember
we
used
the
best
part
of
two
boxes
i
depend
upon
you
said
daphne
be
civil
to
him
for
five
minutes
and
we
we
wait
for
you
between
mary
and
the
radcliffe
but
how
nice
of
you
i
should
hate
to
suggest
that
you
were
not
taking
any
risks
of
course
a
punt
moored
in
midstream
would
be
safer
he
might
be
worse
said
i
i
admit
i
could
spare
the
diamond
but
at
least
he
not
wearing
a
cummerbund
and
sand
shoes
hush
said
jonah
he
keeping
them
for
henley
you
wo
catch
him
out
on
dress
ah
me
he
added
with
a
sigh
i
love
to
see
old
chums
meet
again
do
you
there
nothing
so
touching
said
i
as
a
reunion
of
souls
to
revive
the
memory
of
boyhood
intimacy
of
joys
and
troubles
shared
of
visits
to
the
if
the
truth
were
known
i
expect
they
were
always
together
sort
of
inseparable
you
know
no
doubt
naturally
berry
a
bit
shy
at
first
but
that
often
the
way
before
the
afternoon
out
he
be
calling
him
again
and
they
have
changed
hats
this
said
berry
is
intolerable
a
little
more
and
i
shall
burst
into
large
tears
let
pay
the
bill
will
you
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
now
i
going
to
remember
more
things
in
five
minutes
than
lewis
has
forgotten
in
thirteen
years
will
two
tons
be
enough
make
it
three
said
daphne
and
we
are
to
reassemble
between
mary
and
the
radcliffe
or
was
it
between
the
radcliffe
and
st
mary
we
shall
wait
five
minutes
and
no
more
said
i
that
gives
you
one
minute
forty
seconds
a
ton
or
five
seconds
a
hundredweight
keep
the
home
fires
burning
mathematician
and
imitation
humorist
said
berry
is
it
wonderful
do
forget
to
let
me
know
what
the
bill
comes
to
just
as
a
matter
of
interest
he
sauntered
in
the
direction
of
lewis
who
was
watching
him
with
the
air
of
a
terrier
that
hopes
to
be
taken
out
for
a
walk
i
called
for
the
bill
and
five
minutes
later
the
rest
of
us
were
strolling
across
the
cobbles
under
the
shadow
of
the
radcliffe
camera
as
soon
as
he
comes
said
jonah
we
go
to
new
college
we
can
sit
in
the
gardens
there
for
a
bit
and
suck
when
the
process
of
digestion
is
completed
we
can
see
the
chapel
and
hall
and
then
one
of
us
can
borrow
a
gown
and
we
look
in
at
the
bodleian
the
project
seemed
admirable
but
as
has
been
frequently
remarked
man
but
proposes
more
than
four
minutes
had
elapsed
and
we
were
casually
sauntering
towards
the
high
to
see
if
berry
was
in
sight
when
the
latter
swung
round
the
corner
of
brasenose
with
lewis
stepping
joyously
by
his
side
instead
of
his
grey
homburg
my
was
wearing
a
soft
clerical
hat
which
was
too
small
for
him
the
ludicrous
effect
created
by
this
substitution
of
headgear
can
be
more
easily
imagined
than
described
for
a
moment
we
wavered
then
jill
gave
a
shriek
of
laughter
and
we
broke
and
scattered
something
after
the
manner
of
a
mounted
reconnoitring
patrol
that
has
unexpectedly
bumped
into
a
battalion
of
the
enemy
our
retreat
however
was
not
exactly
precipitate
and
we
endeavoured
to
invest
it
with
a
semblance
of
hypocrisy
not
usually
thought
necessary
in
warfare
but
it
was
in
no
sense
dignified
and
only
a
child
too
young
to
differentiate
between
right
and
wrong
could
have
failed
to
recognize
the
true
motive
which
prompted
our
withdrawal
seizing
agatha
by
the
arm
i
turned
left
about
pointed
vehemently
to
the
dome
of
the
camera
and
hurried
her
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
which
admitted
to
that
institution
simultaneously
jonah
wheeled
right
about
and
apparently
imparting
information
of
a
startling
character
concerning
the
east
front
of
brasenose
to
his
sister
and
cousin
began
to
hustle
them
towards
the
entrance
to
berry
repeated
nominal
exhortations
we
paid
not
the
slightest
attention
coal
or
no
coal
the
combination
of
lewis
and
my
the
latter
in
a
mood
which
the
assumption
of
so
ridiculous
a
garb
made
it
impossible
to
mistake
was
too
awful
to
contemplate
there
are
things
which
are
worse
than
a
cold
bath
i
did
not
stop
until
we
were
safely
on
the
leads
of
the
camera
considerably
out
of
breath
we
leaned
cautiously
upon
the
balustrade
if
possible
from
our
eminence
to
observe
the
manoeuvres
of
our
terror
look
where
we
would
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
the
brute
must
have
followed
the
others
into
i
panted
love
to
see
them
come
out
i
think
he
a
scream
said
agatha
if
he
could
only
see
himself
in
that
hat
she
dissolved
into
peals
of
laughter
i
agree
but
i
rather
watch
from
the
stalls
than
assist
him
in
one
of
his
turns
stalls
this
is
more
like
the
gallery
true
but
remember
sups
with
the
devil
should
hold
a
long
spoon
all
the
same
if
you
can
bear
another
proverb
an
ill
wind
etc
if
i
had
been
hard
up
for
a
refuge
i
should
never
have
thought
of
bringing
you
up
here
and
for
any
one
to
get
an
idea
of
oxford
it
as
good
a
place
as
i
know
miss
deriot
gazed
at
the
magnificent
prospect
before
replying
it
ought
to
make
me
feel
very
small
she
said
suddenly
but
somehow
it
does
it
so
terribly
old
and
all
that
but
it
got
such
a
kind
look
that
said
i
is
the
quality
of
oxford
and
i
congratulate
you
you
are
articulate
where
wise
men
have
stood
dumb
perhaps
it
because
you
so
much
alike
who
you
and
oxford
am
i
so
terribly
old
i
shook
my
head
but
you
beautifully
built
and
you
got
a
kind
look
and
handsome
ways
and
your
temples
are
a
dream
and
all
our
swains
commend
you
and
stop
stop
you
getting
mixed
not
at
all
my
intellect
was
never
less
clouded
in
spite
of
two
glasses
of
ginger
beer
my
hand
is
like
a
spade
i
mean
a
rock
insert
a
fly
in
your
eye
and
i
will
remove
it
unhesitatingly
i
take
your
word
for
it
said
agatha
one
of
these
days
i
shall
compare
you
to
a
burst
of
melody
at
the
present
moment
i
am
between
your
dimple
and
the
deep
sea
the
dimple
you
are
said
agatha
with
a
smile
that
promised
laughter
with
difficulty
suppressed
amusedly
i
regarded
her
she
was
very
tastefully
dressed
a
blue
silk
coat
and
a
white
laced
blouse
beneath
it
a
pale
grey
skirt
of
some
soft
stuff
grey
silk
stockings
and
small
grey
shoes
these
with
a
hat
of
crocheted
silk
that
matched
her
jersey
suited
her
pretty
figure
and
the
april
day
to
rare
perfection
leaning
easily
against
the
worn
masonry
of
the
balustrade
slight
lithe
and
graceful
she
was
the
embodiment
of
vitality
in
repose
she
stood
so
still
but
there
was
a
light
shining
in
the
brown
eyes
that
were
cast
down
and
over
the
parapet
keeping
a
careful
watch
for
any
indication
of
berry
activity
a
quiver
of
the
sensitive
nostrils
an
eagerness
hanging
on
the
parted
lips
which
with
her
flushed
cheeks
lent
to
a
striking
face
an
air
of
freshness
and
a
keen
de
that
was
exhilarating
beyond
description
i
wonder
what
happening
said
agatha
nodding
down
at
the
gateway
can
they
get
out
another
way
i
not
sure
there
is
another
gate
but
at
last
said
a
familiar
voice
i
would
have
missed
those
stairs
for
anything
think
of
the
fools
who
trodden
them
before
the
next
moment
berry
followed
by
lewis
made
his
appearance
why
here
are
our
little
playmates
he
advanced
beaming
do
be
shy
any
longer
and
what
a
storied
retreat
you
have
selected
he
indicated
the
building
with
a
sweep
of
his
arm
you
know
originally
this
was
a
lighthouse
but
henry
the
eighth
lost
his
mat
down
the
chute
and
had
it
closed
down
in
revenge
there
was
a
great
deal
of
feeling
about
it
especially
on
the
part
of
the
king
he
hunted
from
a
litter
for
months
i
addressed
myself
to
miss
deriot
wonderfully
is
he
scratch
the
buffoon
and
you
get
the
charlatan
berry
turned
to
lewis
much
of
my
crowded
life
he
said
has
been
devoted
to
research
i
am
as
it
were
a
crystal
fount
of
knowledge
i
beg
that
you
will
bathe
in
me
not
knowing
exactly
what
reply
to
make
to
this
offer
lewis
laughed
heartily
while
agatha
overcome
with
emotion
hurriedly
turned
away
and
stared
over
the
roofs
of
oxford
shaking
with
long
spasms
of
laughter
stifling
a
desire
to
join
her
i
crossed
to
lewis
and
engaged
him
in
reasonable
conversation
while
berry
seized
the
opportunity
of
indicating
to
agatha
the
main
points
of
the
city
accompanying
his
gesticulations
with
a
series
of
inaudible
remarks
which
to
judge
from
their
reception
concerned
lewis
more
nearly
than
oxford
and
were
of
a
grotesque
character
i
was
just
leading
up
to
the
question
of
fuel
when
a
cry
from
my
interrupted
me
my
hag
he
announced
is
below
with
a
notorious
winebibber
where
are
the
women
police
the
next
moment
he
had
slid
an
arm
through
agatha
and
had
begun
to
descend
i
followed
with
lewis
i
pass
over
the
meeting
in
the
street
below
which
i
was
just
in
time
to
witness
berry
swoop
was
so
sudden
that
his
prey
appeared
to
realize
that
the
game
was
up
and
made
no
attempt
to
fly
it
was
almost
piteous
an
apprehension
of
certain
embarrassment
to
come
extinguished
the
instant
impulse
to
shriek
with
laughter
which
was
written
plain
upon
their
faces
and
my
sister
gave
one
wild
glance
about
her
before
turning
to
face
the
delinquent
as
i
came
up
she
addressed
him
berry
i
appeal
to
you
to
take
off
that
hat
my
tongue
was
the
reply
i
mean
my
hands
are
clean
bereft
of
my
own
headgear
i
had
no
choice
some
priest
is
now
scandalizing
his
parishioners
by
parading
in
a
homburg
which
is
four
sizes
too
big
for
him
while
i
would
you
have
me
go
naked
in
the
streets
here
the
passed
preceded
by
his
bedels
with
staves
reversed
and
berry
uncovered
and
fell
upon
his
knees
surprised
by
the
unwonted
attention
the
dignitary
raised
his
and
bowed
let
go
and
touch
him
said
berry
excitedly
then
we
sha
get
the
king
evil
that
the
origin
of
inoculation
i
implore
you
said
daphne
to
behave
yourself
as
a
personal
favour
you
see
in
me
said
her
husband
a
huntleyed
palmer
seeking
the
tomb
of
anne
of
cloves
on
finding
it
i
must
scourge
myself
anyone
who
directs
me
to
it
will
be
assaulted
she
buried
at
oranges
said
jonah
but
do
let
that
stop
you
berry
replaced
his
wideawake
and
stared
at
him
to
mock
me
he
said
is
most
dangerous
several
people
have
been
transformed
for
such
an
offence
only
yesterday
i
was
compelled
to
change
a
into
a
gorgonzola
of
military
age
several
clocks
struck
the
two
look
here
said
i
we
want
to
go
to
new
college
and
house
but
we
ca
push
off
if
you
going
to
come
with
us
looking
like
that
for
heaven
sake
go
back
to
and
get
your
own
hat
lewis
wo
you
go
and
fix
him
up
quick
as
a
flash
daphne
threw
her
weight
into
the
scale
which
i
had
slung
yes
do
she
implored
you
know
you
ought
to
have
let
him
come
out
like
that
she
added
with
a
reproachful
smile
and
then
you
can
join
us
a
new
college
our
manoeuvre
was
successful
beyond
all
expectation
his
vanity
flattered
the
gentleman
addressed
flung
himself
into
the
breach
with
every
manifestation
of
delight
and
seizing
my
by
the
arm
haled
him
gleefully
in
the
direction
of
the
high
humouring
his
obvious
reluctance
with
the
familiar
assurances
which
one
usually
associates
with
the
persuasion
of
the
unsober
in
silence
we
watched
them
till
they
had
turned
the
corner
then
did
i
say
new
college
said
daphne
hurriedly
you
did
said
i
so
we
better
go
straight
to
house
three
minutes
later
we
were
exploring
my
old
rooms
in
peckwater
quadrangle
christ
church
in
spite
of
its
inauspicious
beginning
we
spent
an
enjoyable
afternoon
by
common
consent
new
college
was
ruled
out
of
our
itinerary
but
oxford
can
not
be
viewed
in
a
day
and
we
found
much
to
delight
our
senses
south
of
the
high
street
finally
a
languorous
journey
by
punt
from
the
barges
to
magdalen
bridge
more
than
compensated
us
for
the
somnolent
which
we
had
been
proposing
to
spend
under
the
shadow
of
the
city
wall
our
return
to
a
movement
which
was
effected
with
great
caution
was
eagerly
awaited
by
the
who
inquired
anxiously
regarding
my
and
produced
his
grey
homburg
with
a
note
addressed
the
stuck
in
the
hatband
the
gentleman
as
was
of
your
party
sir
was
inquirin
about
an
hour
or
two
back
sir
gone
when
a
reverend
gent
come
in
all
of
a
state
with
this
in
seems
he
took
it
away
like
instead
of
own
sir
though
can
made
such
a
mistake
i
ca
think
bein
a
church
as
plain
as
plain
but
they
like
that
up
sir
some
o
them
we
stared
at
one
another
frankly
astonished
to
learn
that
fantastic
explanation
was
founded
strictly
upon
fact
did
the
clergyman
get
his
own
back
said
i
yes
sir
it
was
in
the
apparently
neither
the
porter
nor
the
divine
had
any
idea
of
the
abuse
to
which
the
latter
wideawake
had
been
put
oh
well
our
friend
be
in
presently
said
jonah
taking
the
homburg
when
he
comes
tell
him
we
got
his
hat
and
are
having
tea
very
good
sir
you
see
there
a
note
there
sir
the
reverend
wrote
it
i
think
was
to
ave
seen
your
gentleman
and
told
sorry
was
but
when
was
out
sits
down
an
writes
a
letter
was
in
a
state
poor
man
said
daphne
following
after
jonah
after
all
there
no
harm
done
it
was
a
near
thing
said
i
but
for
my
nonsense
said
daphne
i
got
him
away
to
be
candid
said
jonah
if
anybody
to
get
a
mention
i
inclined
to
think
it
should
be
mr
lewis
while
we
were
waiting
for
tea
i
read
the
letter
aloud
can
never
adequately
express
my
regret
for
the
distressing
if
momentary
aberration
unhappily
responsible
for
my
appropriation
of
a
hat
which
in
no
way
resembles
my
dare
entertain
no
hope
that
inconvenience
has
not
resulted
to
you
but
i
beg
that
you
will
accept
first
my
fervid
assurance
that
it
was
not
of
industry
but
of
case
that
i
offended
and
secondly
my
most
humble
apologies
for
the
commission
of
so
unfriendly
a
am
sir
obedient
servant
st
bildew
when
i
had
finished
i
do
understand
half
of
it
said
jill
i
confess
it
needs
annotating
but
it
worth
keeping
for
it
the
real
thing
my
dear
a
human
document
you
see
oxford
is
the
most
wonderful
backwater
in
the
world
but
it
a
backwater
and
if
you
stay
in
it
always
said
agatha
and
never
come
out
into
the
stream
you
are
liable
to
take
the
wrong
hat
and
to
write
letters
that
would
be
the
better
for
footnotes
berry
arrived
with
the
tea
in
silence
he
received
his
own
hat
compared
it
with
one
which
he
had
just
purchased
and
then
handed
the
latter
to
the
waiter
in
silence
he
read
bildew
note
in
silence
he
selected
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
and
sank
into
a
chair
i
ca
bear
it
said
daphne
where
mr
lewis
happily
he
decided
to
catch
a
train
twenty
minutes
ago
otherwise
it
would
have
been
murder
i
should
have
pleaded
guilty
to
manslaughter
committed
under
extreme
provocation
that
man
ought
to
be
allowed
i
suppose
you
forgot
to
go
to
new
college
yes
just
so
and
the
coal
said
i
have
you
fixed
that
up
three
tons
of
the
best
nuts
are
to
be
delivered
between
two
and
three
afternoon
nothing
is
to
be
said
nothing
signed
nobody
is
to
know
anything
about
it
the
carter
will
simply
take
up
the
plate
shoot
the
stuff
in
and
push
off
as
i
happened
to
have
six
pounds
ten
shillings
upon
me
the
transaction
will
not
be
recorded
with
a
depreciatory
hand
he
waved
aside
the
involuntary
buzz
of
grateful
admiration
i
am
not
long
for
this
world
i
am
as
it
were
for
a
more
worthy
sphere
my
translation
may
occur
any
moment
i
should
like
lewis
to
have
some
trifle
in
memory
of
me
a
personal
effect
i
mean
i
got
a
somewhere
but
anything
useful
will
do
we
made
a
point
of
being
in
upon
the
following
afternoon
it
was
not
often
that
we
all
sat
down
to
lunch
together
but
the
satisfaction
of
witnessing
the
delivery
of
three
precious
tons
of
coal
in
the
teeth
of
the
authorities
was
more
than
we
could
forego
the
butler
was
admitted
to
our
confidence
and
instructed
to
stifle
any
attempt
to
allay
curiosity
by
interpretation
of
the
carman
that
might
originate
in
the
servants
hall
and
immediately
after
luncheon
which
finished
at
three
minutes
to
two
an
was
established
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
windows
in
which
jill
was
posted
with
orders
to
advise
us
directly
the
convoy
appeared
in
the
library
we
spent
a
restless
time
berry
usually
somnolent
at
this
hour
sat
upon
the
club
kerb
and
toyed
with
jonah
fidgeted
with
a
refractory
pipe
daphne
glanced
from
the
clock
to
her
novel
and
the
novel
to
the
clock
at
intervals
of
fifteen
seconds
and
i
wrote
four
letters
to
the
war
office
about
my
gratuity
and
very
properly
destroyed
them
as
incoherent
one
after
another
at
a
quarter
past
two
by
common
consent
i
visited
jill
to
see
if
she
was
asleep
when
i
made
my
report
we
reminded
one
another
that
lewis
had
said
between
two
and
three
and
agreed
that
it
was
early
as
yet
at
two
daphne
left
the
room
and
did
not
return
at
twenty
minutes
to
three
i
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
my
uneasiness
and
joined
my
cousin
and
sister
in
the
ten
minutes
later
jonah
and
berry
came
in
after
a
hurried
consultation
it
was
decided
that
if
the
coal
had
not
arrived
in
ten
minutes
time
berry
should
telephone
to
lewis
forthwith
almost
immediately
it
was
found
that
nobody
knew
the
number
initials
or
address
and
reference
to
the
directory
showed
that
there
were
four
columns
of
subscribers
all
bearing
his
name
at
five
minutes
past
three
the
strain
was
telling
and
every
temper
began
more
or
less
to
show
signs
of
wear
and
tear
are
you
sure
said
daphne
for
the
fourth
time
that
it
was
to
come
between
two
and
three
no
said
her
husband
that
why
i
been
waiting
fool
said
his
wife
berry
sighed
some
people
are
very
hard
to
please
if
i
were
you
i
should
take
a
course
of
ventriloquism
then
you
can
ask
yourself
questions
and
give
yourself
any
perishing
answers
you
like
at
times
you
might
even
revile
yourself
five
minutes
later
jonah
announced
that
he
was
going
to
ranelagh
and
inquired
whether
any
one
wanted
a
round
of
golf
berry
accepted
the
invitation
and
they
left
together
the
arrival
of
fitch
with
the
car
at
three
reminded
my
sister
that
she
was
going
to
call
upon
some
one
in
regent
park
and
she
withdrew
in
a
state
of
profound
depression
jill
who
was
on
the
very
brink
of
tears
refused
to
leave
her
post
until
a
quarter
to
four
and
when
that
hour
arrived
but
coalless
it
was
only
my
promise
to
take
her
to
see
charlie
chaplin
forthwith
that
could
coax
the
ghost
of
a
smile
to
play
about
her
lips
as
i
closed
the
behind
us
a
neighbouring
clock
struck
four
moodily
we
walked
down
the
street
talking
of
cinemas
and
thinking
of
coal
had
our
thoughts
been
otherwise
employed
the
condition
of
the
pavement
outside
a
house
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
yards
down
on
the
opposite
side
would
have
recalled
them
pellmell
to
our
disappointment
it
was
obvious
that
a
considerable
quantity
of
coal
had
been
recently
delivered
to
a
more
fortunate
idly
i
looked
at
the
number
of
the
house
either
pillar
of
the
porch
a
freshly
painted
grinned
at
for
a
moment
i
stared
at
them
blankly
then
jill
gave
a
choking
cry
and
caught
at
my
arm
i
realized
with
a
shock
that
while
lewis
had
been
as
good
as
his
word
my
recollection
of
our
change
of
address
was
less
dependable
chapter
vi
how
nobby
attended
a
wedding
and
berry
spoke
nothing
but
the
truth
if
i
am
to
drive
said
jonah
i
wo
be
responsible
for
doing
it
in
a
minute
under
two
hours
he
looked
down
at
nobby
who
with
a
section
of
one
of
my
in
his
mouth
was
importuning
him
to
play
by
the
simple
expedient
of
thrusting
the
bauble
against
the
calf
of
his
leg
my
good
dog
if
you
expect
me
to
interrupt
an
agreeable
breakfast
to
join
you
in
the
game
of
which
you
never
tire
you
are
doomed
to
disappointment
go
and
worry
your
owner
with
a
reproachful
look
the
terrier
took
his
advice
and
trotting
across
to
the
sideboard
laid
his
toy
at
my
feet
and
looked
up
expectantly
i
hardened
my
heart
it
is
not
my
practice
said
i
to
gambol
upon
an
empty
stomach
try
jill
slowly
the
brown
eyes
sank
from
mine
to
the
bottom
button
of
my
waistcoat
as
i
moved
to
my
place
plate
in
hand
he
gave
a
protesting
bark
which
was
answered
by
a
from
the
of
a
passing
van
in
a
flash
nobby
was
upon
the
sill
of
the
open
window
hurling
defiance
at
the
intruder
is
he
coming
with
us
said
daphne
i
do
see
why
he
should
we
can
leave
him
at
hillingdon
while
we
at
church
by
the
way
what
time
does
the
balloon
go
up
the
marriage
said
jonah
is
to
be
solemnized
at
two
as
i
said
a
moment
ago
it
take
us
two
hours
to
get
there
if
we
start
at
eleven
that
give
us
an
hour
to
brush
one
another
lunch
and
rehearse
the
series
of
genial
banalities
with
which
it
is
the
habit
of
to
insult
one
another
intelligence
i
believe
said
jill
i
heard
the
telephone
i
called
upon
nobby
to
suspend
his
fury
and
we
all
listened
sure
enough
a
long
spasm
of
ringing
came
simultaneously
from
the
library
and
the
lobby
in
the
back
hall
i
should
be
surprised
said
i
if
that
was
the
club
to
tell
me
i
drawn
a
runner
in
the
sweep
and
with
that
i
left
my
kidneys
and
repaired
to
the
library
can
i
speak
to
major
pleydell
said
a
voice
who
is
it
please
the
waddell
institute
speaking
oh
yes
will
you
hold
the
line
i
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
shouted
for
berry
there
was
no
reply
in
some
annoyance
i
ascended
the
first
flight
and
shouted
again
from
behind
a
closed
door
his
voice
answered
me
it
was
with
a
malicious
pleasure
that
i
located
its
origin
a
moment
later
i
opened
the
bathroom
door
from
the
depths
of
a
luxurious
bath
berry
regarded
me
that
right
he
said
you
come
in
do
take
any
notice
of
me
and
do
shut
the
door
or
the
servants
wo
be
able
to
see
in
you
are
wanted
said
i
upon
the
telephone
how
interesting
said
berry
i
suppose
you
told
them
to
hold
on
i
did
he
sank
into
a
recumbent
position
and
crossed
his
legs
what
a
marvellous
thing
he
said
the
telephone
is
there
that
fool
heaven
knows
how
many
miles
away
sitting
with
his
ear
glued
to
a
piece
of
vulcanite
and
here
am
i
in
the
midst
of
an
exacting
toilet
think
he
hear
me
if
i
were
to
shout
or
would
you
rather
take
a
message
it
is
said
i
the
waddell
institute
the
savagery
with
which
my
invested
a
very
ordinary
expletive
was
quite
remarkable
why
he
added
sitting
upright
can
not
they
ring
up
at
a
lawful
hour
why
must
they
the
sentence
was
never
finished
with
the
rush
of
a
whirlwind
nobby
tore
into
the
room
his
delight
at
having
run
me
to
earth
was
transformed
to
ecstasy
at
encountering
unexpectedly
another
member
of
the
household
hitherto
missing
from
his
tale
and
observing
that
the
latter
face
was
a
reasonable
distance
from
the
ground
and
so
less
inaccessible
than
usual
the
sealyham
leapt
upon
the
rim
of
the
bath
to
offer
the
lick
of
greeting
which
it
was
his
practice
to
bestow
the
result
was
inevitable
nobby
tried
to
save
himself
by
reaching
for
berry
shoulder
with
his
forepaws
but
at
the
critical
moment
his
buffer
flinched
the
paws
fell
short
of
their
objective
and
with
a
startled
grunt
the
terrier
fell
heavily
into
the
bath
his
desperate
claws
leaving
two
long
abrasions
upon
his
victim
ribs
the
scene
that
followed
baffles
description
berry
began
to
roar
like
a
wounded
bull
while
a
bedraggled
nobby
scrambled
and
blew
and
slipped
and
scratched
caring
not
at
all
what
was
his
understanding
so
long
as
it
provided
a
foothold
and
kept
his
head
above
water
he
thinks
i
a
straw
yelled
berry
he
catching
at
me
do
stand
there
like
a
get
him
but
i
was
helpless
with
laughter
from
which
i
only
recovered
in
time
to
rescue
the
offender
who
with
the
bath
to
himself
was
swimming
sturdily
in
the
deep
water
and
scrabbling
fruitlessly
on
the
porcelain
while
berry
in
a
and
a
loud
voice
identified
and
enumerated
the
several
scratches
upon
his
person
for
heaven
sake
said
i
go
and
answer
the
telephone
i
shall
die
said
berry
slipping
his
feet
into
a
pair
of
pumps
i
shall
get
pneumonia
bis
and
die
i
got
into
that
bath
in
the
prime
as
it
were
the
very
heyday
of
life
and
now
at
least
i
shall
be
in
the
fashion
body
of
the
deceased
bore
signs
of
extreme
physical
violence
any
more
for
the
crime
wave
i
wrapped
nobby
in
my
towel
and
followed
the
latter
downstairs
my
sister
was
standing
in
the
library
doorway
what
on
earth
she
demanded
has
been
the
matter
i
held
up
my
hand
listen
berry
was
speaking
upon
the
telephone
is
that
the
waddell
institute
i
am
so
very
sorry
i

almost
say
distracted
that

have
been
kept
waiting

emma
ak
u
l
for
leather
i
beg
your
pardon
yes

tawful
well
if
you
must
know
it
was
a
bloodhound
they
told
me
at
the
dogs
home
that
he
lost
his
scent
as
a
result
of
the
air
raids
but
last
night
the
charwoman
gave
him
a
sausage
i
left
and
he
pulled
me
down
this
morning

and
we

daphne
i
am
glad
that
a
real
load
off
my
mind
write
and
tell
them
this
morning
will
you
i
looked
up
from
the
operation
of
drying
nobby
and
nodded
poor
people
they
be
so
thankful
and
now
what
happened
upstairs
mixed
bathing
said
i
your
husband
had
not
left
the
bath
when
nobby
entered
it
both
were
frightened
but
neither
was
hurt
as
i
spoke
berry
emerged
from
the
library
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
my
skin
he
said
has
been
defaced
my
beautiful
trunk
has
been
lacerated
as
with
jagged
nails
you
know
i
tremble
for
that
soul
it
may
be
his
fault
but
it
invariably
my
misfortune
he
turned
to
my
sister
you
heard
about
walter
thomas
good
and
now
i
shall
slip
on
some
iodine
and
underclothes
and
come
down
as
i
am
jonah
says
we
must
leave
at
eleven
said
daphne
for
goodness
sake
do
be
late
my
wedding
garments
are
prepared
and
but
await
my
entry
the
trousers
are
unrolled
the
boots
untreed
the
tie
dusted
of
course
we
taking
nobby
i
looked
up
from
my
charge
who
was
by
this
time
fairly
dry
and
as
full
of
beans
as
an
egg
is
of
meat
of
course
of
course
you
never
know
i
might
get
run
over
that
give
him
an
opening
here
said
i
is
your
towel
he
all
right
now
carefully
berry
fingered
the
fabric
he
was
wet
was
he
he
said
yes
i
suppose
i
can
dry
myself
on
the
curtains
i
wonder
which
of
us
he
would
bite
if
i
were
to
assault
you
he
hung
the
towel
over
his
arm
picked
up
the
terrier
and
looked
into
his
eyes
you
wicked
scrap
why
he
not
nearly
dry
yet
nobby
licked
his
face
come
along
up
with
uncle
and
we
share
the
the
two
disappeared
up
the
staircase
wrangling
amicably
regarding
my
right
to
pull
the
terrier
whiskers
you
wo
forget
to
write
will
you
said
daphne
as
we
returned
to
the
i
promise
said
i
you
shall
see
the
letter
trooper
dale
had
been
in
my
squadron
in
the
field
and
for
three
weeks
he
had
taken
my
first
servant
place
incidentally
he
had
also
taken
two
pounds
ten
shillings
in
notes
which
i
frankly
admit
i
had
no
business
to
have
left
in
my
pocket
taxed
with
the
theft
he
had
broken
down
and
told
me
a
piteous
tale
a
delicate
wife
and
a
little
boy
with
curvature
of
the
spine
needed
every
honest
halfpenny
that
could
be
turned
and
more
also
between
a
chauffeur
wages
and
his
army
pay
there
was
fixed
a
great
gulf
and
well
it
was
hard
to
know
that
the
child
was
suffering
for
want
of
nourishment
i
caused
inquiries
to
be
made
a
convenient
aunt
investigated
the
case
and
found
it
genuine
between
us
we
did
what
we
could
then
on
her
return
from
egypt
my
sister
visited
the
family
and
reported
that
they
would
be
most
thankful
if
the
child
could
be
admitted
to
a
home
with
the
waddell
institute
berry
had
influence
and
at
last
a
coveted
vacancy
had
been
obtained
before
we
left
for
monk
honour
i
composed
a
suitable
letter
to
the
telling
him
that
his
little
boy
could
soon
be
received
into
an
institution
from
which
there
was
every
reason
to
believe
that
he
would
eventually
emerge
comparatively
restored
to
health
it
was
a
lovely
day
and
we
were
glad
of
it
for
at
two
my
cousin
madrigal
was
to
be
married
from
the
old
house
where
she
was
born
and
in
the
old
church
in
which
she
was
baptized
a
special
train
was
being
run
from
london
but
monk
honour
lay
four
miles
from
the
nearest
station
and
it
was
doubtful
if
the
supply
of
cars
and
carriages
would
prove
equal
to
the
demand
therefore
we
had
decided
to
go
down
by
road
with
my
uncle
land
marched
the
acres
of
hillingdon
where
the
tanyons
lived
and
they
had
very
kindly
invited
us
to
luncheon
so
that
we
should
not
descend
untimely
upon
a
simmering
household
in
their
keeping
we
proposed
to
leave
nobby
and
the
car
the
house
was
only
five
minutes
walk
from
the
church
and
as
many
again
from
madrigal
home
so
that
once
we
had
reached
the
village
we
should
need
no
conveyance
until
the
time
came
for
us
to
return
to
town
for
a
wonder
we
were
all
on
time
and
it
was
barely
eleven
when
jonah
let
in
the
clutch
and
the
rolls
began
to
move
daphne
sat
in
front
and
jill
between
berry
and
me
on
the
back
seat
the
girls
wore
to
save
their
finery
and
two
large
bandboxes
concealed
their
respective
hats
berry
jonah
and
i
wore
light
overcoats
above
our
and
three
tall
hats
ironed
to
perfection
each
in
his
stiff
white
jostled
one
another
on
the
mat
at
our
feet
a
smaller
box
by
their
side
contained
three
blooming
gardenias
once
clear
of
london
jonah
gave
the
rolls
her
head
and
we
were
soon
floating
through
the
midst
of
blowing
cherry
orchards
and
fragrant
hop
gardens
which
of
the
great
sun
were
quick
with
radiance
the
deeper
we
plunged
into
the
countryside
the
richer
this
became
here
was
a
treasure
of
woodland
and
there
a
wealth
of
pasture
grey
lichened
walls
hoarded
a
precious
park
keeping
the
timid
deer
in
generous
custody
a
silver
stream
stole
between
smiling
hayfields
crept
shadowed
and
cool
under
the
dusty
road
and
beyond
braided
a
spreading
cloth
of
golden
buttercups
that
glowed
with
a
soft
brilliancy
such
as
no
handicraft
on
earth
could
coax
from
the
hard
heart
of
costly
metal
presently
we
left
the
main
road
to
sail
up
a
curling
hill
and
over
and
down
past
a
fair
steading
into
a
friendly
valley
where
the
cattle
stood
drowsy
under
the
shelter
of
giant
chestnut
trees
and
luxuriant
hawthorns
in
full
blossom
filled
all
the
neighbouring
air
with
timely
sweetness
at
the
bidding
of
an
aged
jonah
turned
to
the
left
and
a
moment
later
the
car
was
scudding
up
a
leafy
lane
narrow
and
soon
so
screened
and
arched
with
foliage
that
in
a
little
we
were
being
swept
through
a
veritable
tunnel
seemingly
driven
through
the
living
green
more
than
once
the
lane
changed
direction
but
the
tunnel
held
the
ground
was
rising
but
we
sailed
on
the
steady
purr
of
the
engine
swelling
into
a
low
snarl
as
we
swung
to
right
and
left
between
the
cool
green
walls
as
we
slid
through
marvel
the
clock
of
the
old
grey
church
showed
us
that
it
was
five
and
twenty
to
one
we
were
in
good
time
for
now
but
a
short
seven
miles
lay
between
us
and
the
village
which
we
sought
jonah
settled
himself
in
his
seat
and
prepared
to
cover
the
last
lap
at
an
easier
pace
before
we
had
realized
what
was
happening
it
was
all
over
the
road
which
we
were
using
ran
at
right
angles
into
a
way
by
the
side
of
an
old
here
for
monk
honour
we
must
turn
to
the
left
jonah
prince
of
drivers
slowed
for
the
turn
and
sounded
his
horn
carefully
for
ours
was
the
lesser
road
as
we
rounded
the
corner
there
was
a
deafening
roar
a
cry
a
violent
shock
a
splintering
crash
the
rolls
quivered
like
a
ship
that
has
struck
and
a
great
green
touring
car
tore
past
and
was
gone
in
a
cloud
and
a
flurry
of
dust
before
we
had
come
to
rest
with
our
near
eighteen
inches
up
the
bank
dazedly
i
watched
a
little
white
dog
with
a
black
patch
take
a
flying
leap
into
the
road
stumble
pick
himself
up
and
hurl
himself
in
the
wake
of
the
monster
barking
furiously
then
the
whirling
dust
swallowed
him
up
and
i
saw
him
no
more
lf
said
daphne
lf
write
it
down
somebody
quick
lf
that
right
said
jonah
i
got
it
too
lf
in
silence
i
dragged
a
pencil
out
of
my
pocket
and
with
trembling
fingers
wrote
down
the
precious
figures
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
anybody
hurt
continued
jonah
screwing
himself
round
to
look
at
the
back
seat
we
all
right
said
i
but
it
was
a
close
call
the
brute
cried
jill
passionately
the
beastly
stinking
berry
spoke
between
his
clenched
teeth
in
a
voice
shaken
with
choler
we
have
that
blistered
swine
if
we
have
to
drag
hell
for
him
for
all
he
knows
the
car
overturned
and
on
fire
and
we
pinned
under
it
it
german
pure
german
it
the
most
verminous
thing
i
ever
dreamed
of
it
burn
it
words
fail
me
he
rose
and
got
out
of
the
car
i
followed
him
and
helped
jill
to
alight
she
was
a
little
pale
and
when
she
saw
the
havoc
on
the
her
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
i
put
my
arm
about
her
do
worry
darling
it
looks
worse
than
it
is
and
we
have
that
merchant
blood
we
got
his
number
daphne
came
up
to
comfort
her
and
jonah
after
a
cursory
glance
at
the
damage
limped
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
sat
down
on
the
bank
and
lighted
a
cigarette
what
was
he
doing
said
berry
his
face
still
a
dark
red
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
should
like
to
say
maybe
seventy
maybe
more
but
it
was
a
frightful
pace
i
pointed
along
the
road
to
left
and
right
see
how
it
curves
and
we
on
the
outside
of
the
bend
to
clear
us
at
that
pace
he
had
to
go
over
himself
how
can
we
hit
him
best
all
round
we
can
summon
him
under
the
motor
car
acts
and
bring
a
civil
action
for
damages
he
ought
to
go
down
heavily
no
escape
i
should
say
we
got
him
cold
berry
heaved
a
long
sigh
and
clapped
me
on
the
back
i
feel
better
already
he
said
before
doing
anything
else
jonah
and
i
subjected
the
rolls
to
a
careful
examination
both
wings
and
the
on
the
had
been
ripped
off
and
the
front
axle
was
bent
by
the
side
of
the
the
off
had
apparently
been
struck
on
the
tire
and
the
fact
that
neither
of
the
had
collapsed
spoke
volumes
for
their
sturdy
construction
the
shock
however
had
put
the
out
of
action
so
far
as
we
could
tell
that
was
the
extent
of
the
damage
whether
any
further
injuries
would
later
appear
it
was
impossible
to
say
i
crossed
to
the
girls
and
berry
who
were
seated
disconsolate
upon
the
bank
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
heavily
i
made
my
report
there
only
one
thing
to
do
i
concluded
i
must
leg
it
to
marvel
and
see
if
i
can
raise
a
couple
of
mechanics
some
tools
and
a
car
i
can
drive
back
with
them
and
then
we
can
leave
them
here
and
all
go
on
in
the
hireling
to
hillingdon
we
sha
get
any
lunch
but
we
be
in
time
for
the
wedding
with
luck
by
the
time
we
get
back
from
honour
if
the
fellows
know
their
job
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
the
rolls
to
marvel
under
her
own
power
from
there
she
have
to
come
up
to
town
by
rail
and
we
can
go
back
by
the
special
whenever
it
leaves
as
i
finished
speaking
jill
gave
a
little
cry
and
i
turned
to
see
a
small
white
scrap
way
down
the
long
white
road
plodding
wearily
in
our
direction
it
was
our
champion
as
he
came
nearer
it
was
obvious
that
he
was
much
exhausted
more
than
once
he
stumbled
and
a
red
tongue
lolled
from
his
gaping
jaws
but
his
little
tail
was
up
and
as
he
toiled
gamely
towards
us
he
wagged
it
to
and
fro
by
way
of
greeting
of
one
accord
we
welcomed
him
with
a
cheer
obviously
gratified
by
our
appreciation
nobby
smiled
an
unmistakable
smile
and
wagging
his
tail
more
vigorously
than
before
quickened
his
flagging
steps
a
moment
later
he
thrust
a
dusty
nose
against
my
extended
hand
and
bowing
his
tousled
head
sideways
by
way
of
homage
rolled
over
on
his
back
and
lay
panting
in
the
shade
at
my
feet
good
little
chap
said
i
stroking
his
heaving
flank
it
did
take
you
long
to
get
a
move
on
you
darling
said
jill
stooping
to
caress
him
the
way
you
went
after
that
car
was
just
heroic
i
suppose
said
berry
that
if
i
were
to
suggest
that
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
he
could
catch
it
and
that
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
brilliant
display
of
i
should
be
abused
what
a
shame
cried
daphne
and
jill
in
a
breath
what
a
beastly
shame
i
said
so
said
berry
now
if
i
got
out
and
chased
it
you
have
had
me
certified
i
agree
i
retorted
and
if
you
were
to
offer
to
walk
to
marvel
instead
of
me
i
should
have
you
watched
do
be
afraid
was
the
rejoinder
the
shock
was
severe
but
i
not
as
bad
as
that
how
soon
think
you
be
back
i
turned
to
my
sister
i
banking
on
being
able
to
get
a
car
but
there
may
be
one
so
if
you
can
get
a
lift
do
wait
i
pointed
to
nobby
he
want
to
come
with
me
so
hang
on
to
him
and
if
you
could
find
some
water
i
glanced
at
the
i
think
he
be
glad
of
it
all
right
dear
take
it
as
easy
as
you
can
a
moment
later
i
was
striding
along
the
marvel
road
by
the
time
i
had
covered
the
two
miles
it
was
a
quarter
past
one
and
i
was
unpleasantly
hot
i
was
also
conscious
of
being
improperly
dressed
in
an
unusually
loose
grey
overcoat
tweed
cap
striped
cashmere
trousers
and
boots
i
had
taken
off
my
morning
coat
and
waistcoat
before
starting
to
walk
but
the
heat
was
awful
and
my
stiff
white
shirt
and
collar
were
wilting
visibly
i
was
fortunate
to
obtain
the
services
of
two
mechanics
but
i
must
confess
that
my
face
fell
when
the
only
car
that
was
available
proved
to
be
a
ford
as
we
drew
up
at
the
fatal
corner
the
others
came
out
of
the
to
see
what
was
making
the
noise
when
they
beheld
their
conveyance
they
were
profoundly
moved
do
you
mean
to
say
said
daphne
that
this
is
the
best
you
could
do
i
nodded
and
you
have
to
look
sharp
if
you
want
to
be
there
before
the
service
is
over
one
cylinder
missing
so
the
said
berry
and
where
the
back
seat
i
beg
your
pardon
i
got
it
the
wrong
way
round
it
is
facing
that
way
is
it
yes
oh
but
what
a
line
what
finish
you
know
all
it
wants
is
a
board
with
lights
on
the
radiator
and
somebody
to
close
its
doors
one
day
in
every
year
and
then
whenever
the
fowls
lay
in
it
you
can
turn
them
out
during
this
eulogy
jonah
had
been
busy
transferring
the
from
the
rolls
and
two
minutes
later
the
mechanics
had
been
given
their
instructions
and
we
were
ready
to
start
i
took
the
wheel
with
jonah
sitting
beside
me
daphne
and
jill
sat
upon
the
back
seat
and
berry
in
a
standing
position
nobby
the
and
the
buttonholes
more
than
occupied
the
remaining
space
right
behind
i
inquired
anything
but
said
berry
still
the
door
that
will
shut
is
closed
so
carry
on
as
tenderly
as
i
could
i
let
in
the
clutch
instantly
with
a
frightful
jerk
the
car
leapt
forward
as
it
did
so
berry
lost
his
balance
and
with
a
yell
of
apprehension
fell
heavily
into
the
welter
of
bandboxes
the
cardboard
of
which
gave
right
and
left
construing
his
involuntary
action
as
the
demonstration
of
a
new
game
nobby
immediately
leaped
barking
upon
him
and
began
to
lick
his
face
daphne
and
jill
clung
to
one
another
convulsed
with
merriment
and
emitting
such
tremulous
wails
of
laughter
as
the
function
of
breathing
would
permit
while
with
tears
coursing
down
his
cheeks
jonah
was
trying
to
bellow
a
coherent
description
of
the
catastrophe
into
my
ear
and
all
the
time
the
good
old
car
ground
raving
along
the
road
heaving
herself
over
the
macadam
in
a
sickening
series
of
lurches
to
every
one
of
which
we
found
ourselves
reluctantly
compelled
to
conform
the
bride
was
ten
minutes
late
and
we
beat
her
by
a
short
head
as
we
were
ushered
breathing
heavily
into
our
places
there
was
a
stir
at
the
porch
uprose
the
strains
of
a
hymn
the
bridegroom
glanced
round
and
gave
slightly
at
the
knees
and
the
next
moment
his
future
wife
had
entered
the
aisle
furtively
i
felt
my
collar
and
wiped
the
perspiration
from
my
face
it
was
with
something
of
a
shock
that
as
the
echoes
of
the
amen
died
away
i
heard
a
familiar
growl
hastily
i
turned
in
my
seat
to
see
nobby
three
paces
away
with
back
arched
one
raised
and
his
white
teeth
bared
he
was
regarding
the
trousers
of
an
amateur
sidesman
who
had
set
a
foot
upon
the
broken
string
which
trailed
from
his
collar
with
a
menacing
glare
by
the
time
i
had
bestowed
the
terrier
under
lock
and
key
and
returned
to
the
church
madrigal
was
signing
her
maiden
name
for
the
last
time
five
days
later
berry
received
the
following
letter
douglas
bladder
of
the
vines
swete
rowley
has
handed
us
your
communication
of
the
are
instructed
to
say
that
while
there
is
no
doubt
that
its
number
is
lf
bladder
car
did
not
leave
the
garage
upon
the
day
of
the
accident
in
which
you
were
concerned
for
the
reason
that
he
and
his
chauffeur
were
engaged
in
overhauling
the
is
therefore
obvious
that
a
mistake
has
been
made
and
that
unless
some
other
car
was
bearing
his
number
which
you
will
agree
is
improbable
in
the
natural
confusion
of
the
moment
the
letters
or
figures
or
both
upon
the
offender
were
client
wishes
us
to
add
that
while
the
tone
of
your
letter
is
not
such
as
he
is
accustomed
to
he
appreciates
that
it
was
written
while
you
were
smarting
under
a
sense
of
grave
injury
and
was
indeed
intended
for
somebody
other
than
faithfully
and
this
being
the
quarter
in
which
the
wind
was
sitting
we
made
our
dispositions
accordingly
so
far
as
the
number
of
the
car
was
concerned
daphne
and
jonah
never
wavered
and
we
were
certain
about
its
colour
and
style
moreover
we
were
all
agreed
that
while
the
back
seat
was
empty
there
were
two
people
in
front
and
that
the
one
who
was
not
driving
was
wearing
a
chauffeur
dress
finally
the
village
of
swete
rowley
lay
but
some
miles
from
the
scene
of
the
accident
but
that
was
all
it
was
of
course
unthinkable
that
the
offending
car
could
have
sustained
no
damage
but
it
was
quite
possible
that
it
would
have
nothing
more
serious
to
show
than
a
dented
and
a
battered
wing
and
while
can
be
changed
in
five
minutes
it
is
no
great
matter
to
straighten
a
bent
wing
and
any
traces
of
battery
which
still
survive
can
be
unanswerably
attributed
to
one
or
other
of
quite
a
variety
of
innocent
mishaps
inquiries
were
set
afoot
and
the
moment
we
learned
that
bladder
in
fact
possessed
a
large
green
touring
car
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
driving
himself
at
a
notorious
pace
we
threw
down
the
glove
solicitors
were
instructed
counsel
opinion
was
taken
an
information
was
sworn
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
and
within
one
week
of
the
date
of
his
solicitors
letter
douglas
bladder
had
become
the
recipient
of
a
writ
for
four
hundred
pounds
damages
and
four
separate
summonses
under
the
motor
car
acts
we
were
out
for
blood
at
marvel
police
court
the
defendant
appeared
by
his
solicitor
who
asked
that
the
hearing
of
the
summonses
might
be
adjourned
pending
the
action
in
the
high
court
this
request
was
granted
everything
possible
was
done
to
expedite
matters
and
by
great
good
fortune
the
case
of
came
into
the
special
jury
list
during
the
last
week
of
july
there
is
about
the
high
court
a
signal
air
of
gravity
which
to
the
layman
is
most
compelling
the
majesty
of
the
law
is
not
apparent
of
severity
there
is
but
a
suggestion
something
indeed
of
dignity
but
less
than
a
visitor
will
expect
to
find
something
of
silence
these
are
but
equerries
subordinate
the
lady
paramount
is
consequence
here
seem
to
dwell
those
things
that
signify
here
lies
that
crucial
junction
which
is
at
once
the
terminus
of
cause
and
of
effect
the
here
are
wise
analysts
skilled
to
distil
its
meaning
from
the
idle
word
surgeons
whose
cunning
probes
will
stir
its
motive
from
the
deed
never
so
thoughtless
whole
walls
of
law
books
ranged
very
orderly
make
up
a
reverend
pharmacopoeia
where
you
shall
find
precepts
of
iron
smelted
from
trespasses
and
bickerings
whose
authors
could
they
but
come
to
life
would
gape
and
stare
and
scratch
their
humble
heads
to
find
their
modest
names
become
so
notable
pursed
lips
brows
wrinkled
in
thought
and
restless
anxious
eyes
indorse
the
serious
aspect
of
the
place
the
very
bustle
of
counsel
the
scurry
of
clerks
the
dash
of
messengers
proclaim
matters
of
moment
to
be
afoot
the
whispered
consultation
the
pregnant
nod
the
nervous
litigant
buttonholing
his
lawyer
his
advisers
urging
a
certain
course
upon
an
indignant
suitor
the
furtive
fellowship
of
witnesses
the
solemn
tipstaves
the
ushers
commanding
silence
and
the
still
small
voice
of
justice
charge
all
the
dusty
atmosphere
with
such
importance
as
ties
up
the
ready
tongues
of
chatterers
ushers
the
jest
and
renders
the
very
self
of
folly
and
breathless
punctually
at
ten
his
lordship
entered
the
court
returned
the
bows
of
counsel
and
took
his
seat
upon
the
bench
with
a
sharp
jingle
the
usher
drew
the
green
curtains
across
the
door
which
led
into
the
judges
corridor
descended
into
the
well
of
the
court
and
looked
complacently
about
him
two
or
three
cases
were
mentioned
the
jury
was
sworn
and
the
associate
after
inquiring
nonchalantly
whether
the
king
counsel
were
prepared
called
on
the
case
of
against
and
sank
back
in
his
seat
with
a
look
of
resignation
daphne
jonah
and
jill
were
seated
behind
the
junior
bar
while
berry
and
i
sat
one
upon
either
side
of
our
attorney
at
the
solicitors
table
upon
the
same
bench
a
little
further
along
was
sitting
bladder
a
large
bland
gentleman
with
an
air
of
which
in
the
circumstances
was
rather
too
pronounced
to
be
natural
and
a
taste
in
dress
which
would
have
better
become
a
younger
and
a
slenderer
man
briefly
our
leader
opened
the
case
there
was
little
to
be
said
and
he
was
on
his
feet
for
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
but
in
that
space
of
time
he
had
presented
to
the
jury
so
vivid
a
of
the
accident
and
had
dwelt
so
convincingly
upon
the
facts
which
pointed
to
the
defendant
guilt
that
it
was
actually
difficult
to
believe
that
the
issue
of
the
action
was
any
longer
in
doubt
and
i
began
to
speculate
upon
the
amount
of
damages
we
should
be
awarded
such
is
the
art
of
pleading
a
plan
of
the
spot
at
which
the
collision
had
taken
place
was
produced
and
officially
accepted
by
the
defence
then
jonah
was
called
he
gave
his
evidence
admirably
and
all
counsel
endeavours
to
shake
his
confidence
regarding
the
identity
of
the
were
of
no
avail
daphne
followed
her
cousin
she
was
a
little
nervous
at
first
and
the
judge
requested
her
to
raise
her
voice
she
responded
gallantly
and
the
conviction
with
which
she
told
her
story
in
corroboration
of
jonah
produced
a
noticeable
effect
upon
the
court
the
result
of
her
was
in
our
favour
i
came
next
counsel
for
the
defence
made
a
great
effort
to
pin
me
to
a
certain
estimate
of
the
speed
at
which
the
offending
car
was
moving
but
i
scented
danger
and
refused
to
be
tied
down
it
was
considered
unnecessary
and
not
altogether
expedient
to
expose
our
artless
jill
to
the
mercies
of
our
opponent
team
and
when
i
stepped
down
from
the
box
my
name
was
at
once
called
by
our
junior
counsel
major
pleydell
his
was
very
short
as
was
to
be
expected
he
made
an
excellent
witness
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
defendant
would
be
so
foolish
as
to
appeal
perhaps
because
the
of
his
predecessors
had
been
so
barren
the
leader
for
the
defence
rose
to
deal
with
berry
with
a
menacing
air
he
was
a
silk
whose
obvious
confidence
in
his
ability
was
shared
by
few
influence
rather
than
merit
had
i
was
told
won
his
admission
to
the
inner
bar
and
the
supercilious
manner
which
he
continually
observed
towards
the
bench
afforded
a
exhibition
of
particularly
bad
form
this
mysterious
car
he
began
that
we
all
heard
so
much
about
you
say
it
was
green
i
do
said
berry
what
sort
of
green
a
bilious
green
there
was
a
subdued
titter
and
one
of
the
jurymen
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
his
amusement
the
frown
upon
counsel
face
deepened
was
it
a
light
or
dark
green
sir
light
might
it
have
been
grey
it
might
it
might
have
been
a
beautiful
ruby
pink
but
it
was
it
was
just
green
a
second
titter
more
pronounced
than
before
ran
round
the
court
and
counsel
flushed
angrily
you
have
sworn
that
it
was
an
open
car
so
it
was
and
that
there
were
two
passengers
so
there
were
and
that
the
one
who
was
not
driving
was
wearing
a
uniform
so
he
was
listen
you
saw
its
colour
you
noticed
its
style
you
swear
to
the
number
of
passengers
and
were
actually
able
to
observe
how
one
of
them
was
clad
how
is
it
that
you
can
not
speak
to
its
number
i
will
tell
you
i
was
sitting
on
your
oath
sir
no
on
the
back
seat
there
was
more
than
a
ripple
of
laughter
and
the
judge
shot
a
quick
glance
at
counsel
before
removing
his
and
sitting
back
in
his
chair
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
pleydell
and
captain
mansel
who
were
seated
in
front
obscured
my
view
was
it
because
the
car
was
travelling
too
fast
certainly
not
they
saw
it
that
is
a
matter
of
opinion
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
was
the
retort
it
is
easy
to
be
rude
major
pleydell
i
take
your
word
for
it
counsel
appealed
to
the
judge
my
lord
i
must
ask
your
lordship
i
see
no
reason
to
interfere
was
the
cold
reply
counsel
swallowed
before
proceeding
he
was
one
of
those
who
can
not
let
ill
alone
the
truth
is
he
announced
as
if
byway
or
conclusion
that
your
recollection
of
the
whole
matter
is
extremely
hazy
is
it
for
a
moment
berry
regarded
him
then
he
leaned
back
in
the
box
and
folded
his
arms
you
know
he
said
slowly
shaking
his
head
you
know
you
ca
be
well
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
never
mind
my
health
sir
was
the
heated
reply
oh
but
i
do
said
berry
if
you
were
to
burst
or
anything
i
should
be
all
upset
i
should
again
the
court
which
was
now
packed
rocked
with
merriment
the
tone
in
which
counsel
put
his
next
question
reeked
of
the
insolence
of
anger
you
consider
your
recollection
clear
as
daylight
let
me
explain
counsel
held
up
a
deprecatory
hand
pray
spare
us
there
was
i
believe
a
lot
of
dust
there
was
any
amount
of
it
any
amount
the
road
was
thick
with
it
and
the
air
any
amount
of
that
too
for
a
windless
day
i
never
no
no
was
the
air
thick
with
dust
after
the
car
had
gone
by
yes
it
swallowed
up
the
dog
completely
the
dog
berry
started
and
looked
round
uneasily
perhaps
he
stammered
i
should
have
counsel
rose
at
the
bait
like
a
carp
upon
the
tenth
of
april
this
is
most
interesting
you
say
the
dust
swallowed
the
dog
yes
and
the
dog
swallowed
the
dust
it
was
quite
remarkable
amid
the
tempest
of
laughter
counsel
stood
glowering
what
dog
are
you
referring
to
a
sealyham
when
the
car
had
gone
by
he
jumped
out
into
the
dust
it
had
made
and
ran
after
it
hurriedly
counsel
conferred
with
his
client
why
did
you
mention
this
dog
before
i
did
think
it
necessary
did
you
tell
your
solicitor
about
it
yes
he
did
think
it
necessary
either
really
you
know
i
thought
we
should
get
at
something
presently
now
if
the
defendant
did
happen
to
own
a
sealyham
this
would
be
rather
a
valuable
piece
of
evidence
to
show
that
it
was
his
car
would
it
i
do
think
so
you
see
come
come
sir
up
to
now
nothing
has
been
said
of
the
offending
car
which
could
not
be
said
with
equal
truth
of
the
defendant
i
cordially
agree
both
are
green
both
open
both
according
to
your
story
bear
the
same
number
berry
nodded
unquestionably
he
said
wait
supposing
the
defendant
swears
that
he
has
never
had
a
sealyham
or
any
other
kind
of
terrier
i
do
know
that
i
should
believe
him
but
i
should
argue
it
perhaps
he
does
like
dogs
you
accept
his
statement
for
what
it
was
worth
exactly
and
if
he
had
no
terrier
it
quite
obvious
that
the
car
out
of
which
the
sealyham
jumped
was
not
his
but
somebody
else
undoubtedly
said
berry
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
ours
the
explosion
of
mirth
which
this
statement
provoked
showed
that
his
headlong
progress
towards
the
pit
which
he
had
digged
had
been
gleefully
followed
by
nearly
everybody
in
court
and
counsel
turned
very
pale
have
you
ever
discussed
this
case
with
any
one
i
have
who
with
berry
took
a
deep
breath
well
i
have
seen
my
dentist
lately
but
i
think
everybody
else
i
know
has
had
it
have
you
discussed
it
with
the
other
witnesses
ad
nauseam
have
you
indeed
perhaps
that
explains
why
you
all
tell
the
same
tale
that
said
berry
coolly
is
an
infamous
suggestion
somebody
gave
an
audible
gasp
and
there
was
a
breathless
silence
sitting
back
in
his
padded
chair
the
judge
might
have
been
a
graven
image
sir
thundered
counsel
interrogatively
and
one
beneath
the
dignity
of
even
a
stuff
gown
for
a
long
moment
the
two
men
looked
one
another
full
in
the
eyes
then
counsel
sat
down
somewhat
unsteadily
berry
was
followed
by
an
expert
witness
called
to
substantiate
our
contention
that
two
hundred
pounds
was
a
fair
charge
for
the
execution
of
such
repairs
to
the
rolls
as
the
accident
had
necessitated
and
that
another
two
hundred
for
the
hire
of
a
similar
car
for
the
month
during
which
our
own
was
in
dock
was
not
excessive
as
he
stepped
down
from
the
box
that
my
lord
said
our
leader
is
the
case
for
the
plaintiff
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
when
berry
antagonist
rose
again
to
his
feet
shortly
he
opened
his
case
nothing
he
said
was
more
difficult
to
prove
than
a
negative
but
for
one
thing
it
might
have
gone
hard
with
an
innocent
man
everything
looked
very
black
but
as
luck
would
have
it
most
fortunately
for
himself
bladder
could
prove
incontestably
that
upon
the
of
may
his
car
never
left
its
garage
for
the
very
good
reason
that
its
engine
was
down
i
shall
call
the
defendant
and
i
shall
call
before
you
his
chauffeur
both
will
tell
you
in
detail
that
the
dismantling
of
the
engine
was
commenced
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
that
by
twelve
a
few
minutes
before
the
actual
time
of
the
accident
the
operation
was
completed
that
the
plaintiff
had
suffered
an
injury
he
did
not
attempt
to
deny
as
a
he
had
bladder
sympathy
his
annoyance
was
justified
but
he
could
not
expect
bladder
to
pay
the
penalty
for
somebody
else
misdeeds
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
witnesses
honestly
believed
that
they
had
correctly
memorized
the
letters
and
figures
upon
the
it
was
his
duty
to
satisfy
the
court
that
they
were
mistaken
as
he
sat
down
i
realized
that
it
was
not
going
to
be
a
douglas
bladder
made
a
masterly
witness
i
have
rarely
seen
a
more
accomplished
liar
his
regret
was
infinite
with
horrified
hands
he
deplored
what
he
referred
to
as
the
shocking
affair
he
thundered
unsought
denunciation
of
the
dastardly
conduct
of
some
fugitive
cur
as
a
motorist
he
so
well
understood
our
feelings
but
at
length
and
with
a
wealth
of
detail
he
described
how
he
and
his
chauffeur
had
spent
the
of
may
with
the
exception
of
an
hour
for
lunch
they
had
worked
on
the
car
in
the
garage
from
ten
until
five
it
seemed
a
shame
concluded
the
witness
to
waste
such
a
beautiful
day
but
i
had
earmarked
the
for
the
job
so
we
went
through
with
it
a
most
dangerous
thing
in
the
hands
of
any
witness
detail
is
seldom
employed
by
the
dishonest
it
is
not
difficult
safely
to
embroider
a
lie
but
it
apparently
requires
more
thought
patience
and
rehearsal
than
rogues
out
of
a
hundred
are
prepared
to
spend
it
soon
became
unpleasantly
clear
that
bladder
was
the
hundredth
knave
and
that
in
return
for
his
labour
he
had
a
story
to
tell
which
was
as
excellent
an
imitation
of
the
truth
as
you
might
reasonably
expect
to
hear
in
six
whole
months
of
sundays
i
began
to
feel
extremely
uneasy
to
make
matters
worse
he
came
through
his
untouched
for
every
question
put
to
him
he
had
a
good
natural
answer
and
when
he
stepped
down
from
the
box
and
the
court
rose
at
minutes
past
one
it
was
with
something
of
a
shock
that
i
found
myself
wondering
whether
by
any
possible
chance
a
mistake
had
been
made
and
we
were
pursuing
an
innocent
man
berry
had
engaged
a
table
at
the
and
he
and
the
others
left
immediately
for
there
was
little
time
i
stayed
for
a
moment
to
speak
with
our
advisers
it
no
use
disguising
the
fact
said
counsel
in
a
low
tone
that
we
are
up
against
it
i
believe
that
fellow
to
be
a
prize
liar
he
too
infernally
suave
but
he
knows
his
job
inside
out
and
he
shaken
our
case
badly
i
ca
speak
for
the
judge
but
he
impressed
the
jury
and
you
ca
get
away
from
it
if
his
chauffeur
comes
up
to
the
scratch
i
believe
they
stop
the
case
i
groaned
and
he
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
you
go
and
get
your
lunch
he
said
heavily
i
made
my
way
out
of
the
building
i
was
waiting
for
the
taxi
to
which
i
had
signalled
when
i
observe
said
a
quiet
voice
that
you
do
remember
me
i
swung
round
to
see
a
tall
dark
girl
with
eyes
and
a
charming
smile
regarding
me
amusedly
but
a
moment
before
i
had
passed
her
upon
the
steps
and
as
i
did
so
wondered
what
was
her
business
with
the
supreme
court
i
took
off
my
hat
now
that
i
saw
her
properly
her
face
seemed
faintly
familiar
forgive
me
i
said
i
was
preoccupied
the
smile
deepened
i
defy
you
to
say
where
we
have
met
before
i
continued
to
rack
my
brain
feverishly
but
it
was
no
good
i
ca
concentrate
i
said
desperately
i
can
tell
you
where
we
shall
meet
again
all
right
that
not
the
point
try
madrigal
wedding
of
course
you
were
one
of
her
bridesmaids
that
better
how
nobby
the
taxi
was
waiting
so
i
opened
the
door
i
tell
you
about
him
at
lunch
we
find
the
others
at
the
she
hesitated
it
very
good
of
you
but
my
sister
i
said
gravely
would
never
forgive
me
the
next
moment
we
were
rocketing
past
st
clement
danes
and
now
said
i
what
have
you
been
doing
in
the
palace
of
lies
what
incorruptible
judge
have
you
corrupted
with
your
smile
what
jury
have
you
bewitched
with
your
small
mouth
or
are
you
just
a
ward
in
chancery
my
lady
smiled
what
a
pity
she
said
you
ca
remember
my
name
however
will
you
introduce
me
i
shall
call
you
miss
prision
of
treason
said
i
and
chance
it
and
what
may
i
say
you
were
doing
in
yonder
fool
paradise
you
very
bitter
and
terribly
inquisitive
said
my
companion
still
if
you
must
know
i
came
down
to
be
taken
to
hear
a
case
got
a
brother
at
the
bar
and
the
little
wretch
told
me
to
meet
him
there
and
he
get
me
in
to
hear
a
case
i
started
of
course
he
never
appeared
and
i
my
father
was
a
so
i
not
frightened
i
just
walked
in
and
sat
down
in
the
first
court
i
came
to
it
was
very
interesting
but
there
were
three
judges
all
in
red
too
by
the
way
what
arson
setting
fire
to
a
house
all
on
purpose
like
but
tell
me
know
anything
about
the
case
you
were
to
have
heard
only
that
the
head
of
paul
chambers
is
in
it
that
how
he
knew
it
would
be
interesting
is
he
in
tristram
chambers
how
on
earth
did
you
know
as
she
spoke
the
taxi
drew
up
at
the
entrance
to
the
oh
it
our
precious
case
that
all
i
handed
her
out
twittering
did
you
know
we
had
a
smash
on
the
day
of
the
wedding
i
did
hear
something
you
do
mean
to
say
i
paid
the
driver
and
hurried
her
into
the
hall
if
you
want
to
be
there
i
said
to
see
us
go
down
you
have
to
have
a
pretty
quick
lunch
we
joined
the
others
to
find
them
in
a
state
of
profound
despondency
my
companion
was
immediately
recognized
by
my
sister
and
jill
but
to
my
relief
berry
and
jonah
were
not
quite
so
quick
in
the
uptake
came
to
hear
our
case
i
explained
and
got
swep
into
the
court
of
criminal
appeal
talk
as
you
eat
said
berry
converse
and
masticate
simultaneously
you
know
like
you
used
to
do
before
you
knew
me
what
tristram
got
to
say
i
swallowed
a
piece
of
salmon
before
replying
frankly
pessimistic
i
said
berry
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
ground
his
teeth
a
hard
look
came
upon
jonah
face
and
we
got
to
sit
there
and
watch
that
liar
laugh
in
his
sleeve
he
said
bitterly
and
pay
his
costs
as
well
as
our
own
said
i
jolly
is
it
daphne
touched
me
upon
the
arm
and
i
looked
up
she
was
very
pale
think
it
hopeless
i
think
darling
we
up
against
it
and
and
i
terribly
afraid
i
see
she
whispered
need
jill
and
i
go
back
jill
need
but
you
must
dear
you
a
witness
as
i
spoke
i
shot
a
glance
at
my
cousin
the
latter
was
unburdening
her
soul
to
madge
lacey
the
quondam
bridesmaid
and
to
judge
from
such
fragments
of
the
load
as
reached
my
ears
uttering
sufficient
slander
regarding
douglas
bladder
to
maintain
another
dozen
actions
at
law
as
some
cold
tongue
was
set
before
me
every
thing
was
going
so
well
said
daphne
miserably
i
thought
berry
was
splendid
he
was
said
i
sousing
my
brandy
with
soda
so
were
you
sweetheart
nobody
could
have
done
more
and
they
do
disbelieve
you
and
jonah
they
just
think
you
made
a
mistake
she
nodded
dully
i
do
blame
them
she
said
slowly
that
man
is
so
terribly
clever
his
whole
attitude
a
cry
from
jill
interrupted
her
daphne
boy
she
saw
the
car
on
the
way
to
the
wedding
it
nearly
ran
into
her
too
and
nobby
running
after
it
four
mouths
three
empty
and
one
full
of
tongue
framed
the
interrogative
simultaneously
mother
and
dad
and
i
announced
miss
lacey
bubbling
were
driving
to
the
wedding
as
we
turned
out
of
long
lane
into
the
buckler
road
a
great
green
car
went
by
like
a
flash
of
lightning
fortunately
we
were
on
the
other
side
or
we
have
been
smashed
up
and
miles
behind
there
was
a
little
white
dog
running
the
same
way
i
saw
him
because
i
was
back
to
the
engine
of
course
we
were
going
much
faster
than
him
and
i
soon
lost
sight
of
him
nobby
berry
was
the
first
to
recover
thank
heaven
i
dragged
him
in
he
glanced
at
his
watch
counsel
must
know
this
at
once
come
on
never
mind
the
bill
we
can
settle
later
no
one
who
was
that
afternoon
lunching
at
the
will
ever
forget
our
eruption
from
the
restaurant
the
girls
actually
ran
berry
jonah
and
i
pursued
by
frantic
waiters
thrust
in
their
wake
taking
the
carpeted
steps
three
at
a
time
and
generally
evincing
such
symptoms
of
nervous
excitement
as
are
seldom
seen
save
upon
the
screen
of
a
cinematograph
indeed
our
departure
would
have
done
credit
to
any
stage
manager
and
i
firmly
believe
that
the
majority
of
the
guests
attributed
our
behaviour
to
the
ingenious
brain
of
a
manufacturer
of
films
five
minutes
later
we
panted
up
the
steep
steps
into
the
corridor
which
led
to
our
court
as
luck
would
have
it
our
solicitor
was
in
the
act
of
pushing
open
the
i
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
breathed
into
his
ear
important
new
evidence
vital
we
got
the
witness
here
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
in
there
he
said
shortly
pointing
to
a
consulting
room
i
get
counsel
we
trooped
into
the
apartment
and
shut
the
door
in
silence
we
waited
for
what
seemed
a
century
then
there
were
hasty
steps
the
door
opened
and
the
followed
by
his
junior
and
the
attorney
entered
the
room
briefly
berry
related
the
story
which
miss
lacey
could
tell
this
is
the
lady
he
concluded
i
know
our
case
is
closed
but
surely
she
can
be
called
we
hung
upon
the
reply
can
she
speak
to
the
number
no
but
in
corroboration
my
dear
major
pleydell
said
tristram
you
need
no
corroboration
the
jury
believe
you
they
believe
you
were
smashed
up
they
believe
it
was
done
by
a
green
touring
car
the
devil
of
it
is
they
believe
the
defendant
too
and
so
they
come
to
the
very
natural
conclusion
that
between
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
the
pace
at
which
the
car
was
travelling
pleydell
and
captain
mansel
have
made
a
mistake
only
of
one
figure
in
the
number
they
saw
and
unless
we
can
discredit
that
fellow
story
call
evidence
to
show
he
out
on
that
day
or
something
i
very
much
afraid
we
shall
go
down
his
counsel
is
certain
to
ask
for
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
they
give
it
him
i
never
remember
feeling
so
disappointed
i
think
we
all
felt
the
weight
of
his
words
but
our
collapse
was
pitiful
lured
by
a
treacherous
hope
into
the
belief
that
we
were
saved
we
were
fallen
into
a
deeper
slough
of
despond
than
before
jill
was
hard
put
to
it
to
restrain
her
tears
listlessly
we
followed
our
advisers
into
court
and
a
moment
later
the
judge
took
his
seat
one
or
two
applications
which
did
not
concern
our
case
were
made
then
leading
counsel
for
the
defence
rose
to
his
feet
and
called
his
next
witness
walter
dale
at
the
sound
of
the
name
i
started
violently
then
and
trembling
with
excitement
i
twisted
myself
round
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
witness
as
he
approached
the
box
could
it
be
possible
that
fate
with
fiendish
irony
had
selected
the
whom
we
had
befriended
to
administer
to
our
case
the
de
it
must
be
a
man
of
another
name
but
dale
a
chauffeur
there
was
a
stir
at
the
back
of
the
crowded
court
somebody
was
pushing
his
way
forward
somebody
it
dale
the
short
figure
that
i
had
not
seen
for
more
than
three
years
stepped
out
of
the
ruck
of
onlookers
and
took
its

lips
moved
and
he
kissed
the
testament
he
was
very
pale
as
he
laid
the
book
down

he
looked

in
the
face

heart
began
to

violently

gasped
jurymen
counsel

reporters
every

sat
up
as
if
they
had
been
shot
even
the
judge
started
and
the
defendant
half
rose
from
his
seat
and
when
his
solicitor
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
sank
back
with
bayed
ferocity
in
his
eyes
and
a
face
the
colour
of
i
do
think
you
quite
understood

question

he
pointed
to

the
captain
there
little
i
knowed
when

took
money
scornfully
he
nodded
at
the
defendant
it

an
another
if

nex
day
lettin
out
was
to
see
she
run
after
the
that
was
the
day
before
he
paused
for
lack
of
breath
and
the
judge
turned
his
head
slowly
and
peered
at
counsel
over
the
rim
of
his
glasses
i
was
looking
at
the
defendant
if
any
corroboration
of
dale
story
were
needed
it
was
written
upon
his
master
face
for
all
to
see
guilt
fear
and
beastly
rage
were
horribly
depicted
the
eyes
shifted
frantically
from
side
to
side
the
mouth
worked
uncontrollably
as
i
looked
the
fellow
rose
to
his
feet
swayed
put
a
hand
to
his
throat
and
stepped
uncertainly
towards
the
doors
the
crowd
parted
and
he
passed
through
a
thick
voice
shattered
the
silence
in
the
circumstances
your
lordship
will
appreciate
that
i
can
carry
my
case
no
further
with
a
swish
of
silk
counsel
resumed
his
seat
as
was
to
be
expected
the
jury
delivered
its
verdict
without
leaving
the
box
as
the
applause
subsided
i
ask
for
judgment
with
costs
said
tristram
the
judge
nodded
and
i
direct
he
said
that
the
documents
of
the
case
be
impounded
and
be
sent
to
the
director
of
public
prosecutions
amid
the
buzz
of
excitement
which
succeeded
his
words
i
felt
a
touch
on
my
shoulder
our
leader
was
smiling
cast
your
bread
upon
the
waters
he
said
for
you
shall
find
it
after
many
days
chapter
vii
how
jonah
obeyed
his
orders
and
daphne
and
katharine
festival
backed
the
same
horse
berry
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
and
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
this
he
said
is
the
frozen
edge
i
getting
used
to
the
distemper
which
is
brought
me
in
lieu
of
soup
and
although
i
prefer
salmon
cooked
to
raw
you
may
have
noticed
that
i
consumed
my
portion
without
a
word
but
this
contemptuously
he
indicated
the
severed
upon
his
plate
you
know
they
must
have
been
using
the
nobody
could
get
such
a
withered
effect
with
an
electric
cooker
oh
and
look
at
our
olive
quick
before
it
shuts
up
jill
began
to
shake
with
laughter
i
ca
help
it
said
daphne
desperately
i
know
it
awful
but
what
can
we
do
there
must
be
some
cooks
somewhere
said
i
the
breed
is
extinct
and
they
ca
all
be
irrevocably
suited
i
always
thought
the
brigade
was
one
of
the
most
mobile
arms
of
domestic
service
i
done
everything
said
my
sister
except
advertise
katharine
festival
put
me
off
that
she
says
she
spent
seven
pounds
on
advertisements
and
never
got
a
single
answer
but
i
done
everything
else
i
asked
everybody
i
know
my
name
on
the
books
of
every
registry
office
i
ever
heard
of
and
i
written
and
sent
stamped
addressed
envelopes
to
every
cook
whose
name
i
been
given
three
out
of
about
sixty
have
replied
saying
they
were
already
suited
one
came
here
practically
said
she
come
and
then
wrote
to
say
she
was
frightened
of
the
electric
cooker
and
another
wanted
a
hundred
a
year
and
a
private
bathroom
it
simply
hopeless
if
said
berry
we
survive
this
meal
i
write
to
jonah
and
tell
him
to
bring
one
back
with
him
if
he
ca
raise
one
in
paris
he
ought
to
be
shot
and
now
let
have
a
sweep
on
the
savoury
i
bet
it
tastes
of
paraffin
and
looks
like
a
divvot
let
try
advertising
said
jill
katharine
may
have
had
a
good
one
i
agree
said
i
i
get
one
out
a
real
snorter
in
silence
the
traces
of
the
course
which
had
provoked
the
outburst
were
removed
clean
plates
were
set
before
us
and
the
footman
advanced
with
a
dish
of
fritters
daphne
instinctively
recoiled
hullo
said
berry
another
gas
attack
with
an
effort
my
sister
recovered
herself
and
took
one
with
a
shaking
hand
loyally
jill
followed
her
example
and
with
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
induced
a
glutinous
slab
to
quit
the
silver
to
which
it
clung
desperately
i
declined
the
delicacy
with
compressed
lips
the
servant
offered
it
to
my
berry
shook
his
head
mother
would
like
me
to
he
said
but
i
can
see
it
very
tasty
he
turned
to
his
wife
what
a
wonderful
thing
perfume
is
you
know
the
smell
of
burnt
fat
always
makes
me
think
of
the
edgware
road
at
dusk
hush
said
i
consulting
the
those
were
banana
fritters
that
slimy
crust
enshrined
the
remains
of
a
once
succulent
fruit
what
said
berry
like
beans
in
amber
how
very
touching
i
suppose
undertakers
are
easier
than
cooks
never
mind
it
much
cheaper
i
sha
want
to
be
reminded
of
food
for
several
days
now
he
looked
across
the
table
to
daphne
after
what
i
just
seen
i
feel
i
can
give
the
savoury
a
miss
do
you
agree
darling
or
has
the
fritter
acted
as
an
my
sister
addressed
herself
to
jill
do
eat
it
dear
it
it
not
very
nice
she
rose
shall
we
go
gloomily
we
followed
her
into
the
library
where
i
opened
all
the
windows
and
berry
lighted
a
huge
cigar
in
the
hope
of
effacing
the
still
pungent
memory
of
the
unsavoury
sweet
gradually
it
faded
away
three
weeks
had
passed
since
the
mistress
of
our
kitchen
who
had
reigned
uninterruptedly
for
seven
years
had
been
knocked
down
by
a
taxi
and
sustained
a
broken
leg
simple
though
the
fracture
fortunately
was
at
least
another
nine
weeks
must
elapse
before
she
could
attempt
to
resume
her
duties
and
we
were
in
evil
case
every
day
we
became
more
painfully
aware
of
the
store
which
we
had
unconsciously
set
by
food
as
time
went
on
the
physical
and
mental
disorder
consequent
upon
mason
accident
became
more
and
more
pronounced
all
topics
of
conversation
became
subservient
to
the
burning
question
of
filling
the
void
occasioned
by
her
absence
worst
of
all
dissatisfaction
was
rampant
in
the
servants
hall
and
daphne
maid
had
hinted
broadly
that
if
a
cook
was
not
shortly
forthcoming
resignations
would
be
an
intimation
which
made
us
desperate
moreover
in
another
month
we
were
due
to
leave
town
and
repair
to
white
ladies
there
deep
in
the
country
with
no
restaurants
or
clubs
to
fall
back
upon
we
should
be
wholly
at
the
mercy
of
whoever
controlled
the
preparation
of
our
food
and
unless
the
situation
improved
considerably
the
prospect
was
far
from
palatable
moodily
i
extinguished
my
cigarette
and
filled
and
lighted
a
pipe
in
its
stead
then
i
remembered
my
threat
berry
was
writing
a
letter
so
i
extracted
a
sheet
of
notepaper
from
the
drawer
and
taking
a
pencil
from
my
pocket
sat
down
on
the
sofa
and
set
to
work
to
compose
an
advertisement
calculated
to
allure
the
most
suspicious
and
cook
that
ever
was
foaled
jill
sat
labouring
with
her
needle
upon
a
dainty
pausing
now
and
again
to
hold
a
whispered
and
conversation
with
nobby
who
lay
at
inelegant
ease
supine
between
us
perched
upon
the
arm
of
a
deep
armchair
my
sister
was
subjecting
the
space
devoted
by
five
daily
papers
to
the
announcement
of
situations
required
to
a
second
and
more
leisurely
examination
presently
she
rose
with
a
sigh
and
crossed
to
the
telephone
we
knew
what
was
coming
every
night
she
and
katharine
festival
communicated
to
one
another
their
respective
failures
of
the
day
more
often
than
not
these
took
the
simple
form
of
negative
information
she
was
connected
immediately
hullo
that
you
katharine
yes
daphne
any
luck
not
much
you
know
it
simply
hopeless
what
with
two
boys
of
seven
and
nine
thank
you
i
rather
exactly
well
i
do
know
give
it
up
only
it
so
awful
awful
if
she
does
believe
it
ask
her
to
dinner
said
berry
shut
up
said
daphne
it
all
right
katharine
i
was
speaking
to
berry
oh
he
fed
to
the
teeth
i
can
not
congratulate
you
said
her
husband
upon
your
choice
of
metaphor
my
sister
ignored
the
interruption
oh
rather
his
food
means
a
lot
to
him
you
know
this
said
her
husband
is
approaching
the
obscene
i
dine
off
tepid
wash
and
raw
fish
i
am
tormented
by
the
production
of
a
once
luscious
fillet
deliberately
rendered
unfit
for
human
consumption
and
i
am
deprived
of
my
now
ravening
appetite
by
the
nauseating
reek
from
the
shock
of
whose
assault
i
am
still
trying
to
rally
my
olfactory
nerves
all
this
i
endure
with
that
unfailing
good
will
you
be
quiet
said
his
wife
how
can
i
no
i
wo
said
berry
my
finer
feelings
are
outraged
and
that
upon
an
empty
stomach
i
shall
write
home
and
ask
to
be
taken
away
i
shall
katharine
said
daphne
i
ca
hear
you
because
that
fool
berry
is
talking
but
boy
getting
out
an
advertisement
and
we
going
to
oh
are
you
i
thought
you
said
you
given
it
up
another
nineteen
shillings
worth
well
here
luck
anyway
yes
of
course
but
i
dare
hope
she
replaced
the
receiver
and
turned
to
me
katharine
going
to
start
advertising
again
is
she
i
grunted
well
i
bet
she
does
beat
this
listen
capable
experienced
is
offered
for
three
months
abnormal
wages
every
luxury
and
a
leisurely
existence
electric
cooker
constant
hot
water
separate
bedroom
servants
hall
late
breakfast
town
and
country
followers
mrs
pleydell
cholmondeley
street
mayfair
mayfair
that
the
style
said
berry
let
me
know
when
it
going
to
appear
and
i
get
a
bedroom
at
the
club
when
you
weeded
the
best
out
of
the
first
hundred
thousand
i
come
back
and
give
the
casting
vote
from
behind
my
sister
put
her
arms
about
my
neck
and
laid
her
soft
cheek
against
mine
my
dear
she
murmured
i
dare
half
the
cooks
in
england
would
leave
their
situations
so
much
the
better
said
i
all
fair
in
love
and
war
i
do
know
which
this
is
but
we
call
it
and
chance
it
besides
i
added
cunningly
we
must
knock
out
katharine
the
light
of
battle
leapt
into
my
sister
eyes
looking
at
it
from
her
point
of
view
i
realized
that
my
judgment
had
been
plainly
it
was
not
a
question
of
love
but
of
war
and
that
most
deadly
she
drew
her
arms
from
my
neck
and
stood
upright
could
you
leave
out
my
name
and
just
put
i
shook
my
head
that
so
intangible
besides
i
think
the
telephone
number
a
great
wheeze
thoughtfully
she
crossed
to
the
fireplace
and
lighted
a
cigarette
i
send
it
i
said
suddenly
the
room
was
full
of
silvery
laughter
from
berry
side
at
the
jill
looked
up
sparkling
listen
to
this
she
said
holding
up
the
letter
which
my
had
just
completed
brother
bungler
though
you
are
and
bitter
as
has
been
my
experience
of
your
gaucherie
in
the
past
i
am
once
again
about
to
prove
whether
out
of
the
dunghill
of
inefficiency
which
with
unconscious
humour
you
style
your
there
can
be
coaxed
a
shred
of
reliability
and
is
within
your
knowledge
that
some
three
weeks
ago
this
household
was
suddenly
deprived
of
the
services
of
its
cook
this
out
of
a
clear
sky
and
if
we
may
believe
the
police
in
one
of
those
uncharted
purlieus
which
shroud
in
mystery
the
source
of
the
cromwell
road
after
four
lean
days
your
gluttonous
instincts
led
you
precipitately
to
withdraw
to
paris
from
whence
knowing
your
unshakable
belief
in
the
vilest
forms
of
profligacy
i
appreciate
that
lack
of
means
must
ere
long
enforce
your
i
unforgettable
sultry
days
we
have
endured
the
ghastly
pleasantries
of
charwomen
better
qualified
to
victual
the
lower
animals
than
mankind
to
call
the
first
meal
breakfast
is
sheer
blasphemy
lunch
is
a
hollow
mockery
dinner
the
abomination
of
desolation
i
do
what
i
can
with
and
the
in
the
bathroom
but
the
result
is
unhappy
and
last
night
the
milk
was
too
quick
for
therefore
implore
you
to
collect
a
cook
in
paris
without
delay
bring
it
with
you
when
you
come
or
better
still
send
it
in
advance
carriage
paid
luxury
shall
be
heaped
upon
it
its
slightest
whim
shall
be
gratified
and
it
shall
go
to
the
movies
at
my
expense
whenever
i
am
sent
tickets
can
generosity
go
further
wages
no
object
fare
paid
back
to
paris
as
soon
as
mason
leg
can
carry
i
beseech
you
take
immediate
action
the
horror
of
our
plight
can
not
be
exaggerated
do
something
anything
misrepresent
facts
corrupt
honesty
suborn
the
faithful
but
procure
a
maw
reminds
me
that
it
is
the
hour
of
so
i
must
if
you
ca
raise
one
i
should
come
back
just
go
to
some
high
place
and
quietly
push
yourself
off
it
will
be
simpler
and
avoid
a
scene
which
would
be
painful
to
us
that
rather
worse
than
the
advertisement
said
daphne
but
as
jonah
is
accustomed
to
your
interpretation
of
the
art
of
i
suppose
it
does
much
matter
when
said
berry
you
are
making
yourself
sick
upon
de
veau
en
and
i
shall
remind
you
of
those
idle
words
the
advertisement
appeared
for
the
first
time
on
thursday
morning
as
i
entered
the
at
nine
it
in
said
jill
on
the
front
page
yes
said
berry
it
most
arresting
applicants
will
arrive
from
all
over
the
kingdom
it
inevitable
nothing
can
stop
them
old
and
trusted
retainers
will
become
unsettled
the
domestic
upheaval
will
be
unparalleled
i
read
the
advertisement
through
in
cold
print
my
handiwork
certainly
looked
terribly
alluring
then
i
laid
down
the
paper
and
strolled
to
the
window
it
had
been
raining
but
now
the
sun
was
out
and
the
cool
fresh
air
of
the
june
morning
was
sweet
and
winsome
as
i
looked
into
the
glistening
street
it
a
bit
early
yet
continued
berry
give
a
chance
i
should
think
they
start
about
ten
i
wonder
how
far
the
queue
will
reach
he
added
reflectively
i
hope
the
police
take
it
past
the
albert
memorial
then
they
can
sit
on
the
steps
nonsense
said
i
a
little
uneasily
we
may
get
an
answer
or
two
i
think
we
shall
but
cooks
are
few
and
far
between
they
wo
be
few
and
they
be
anything
but
far
between
by
twelve
he
tapped
the
provocative
paragraph
with
an
accusing
finger
this
is
a
direct
incitement
to
repair
to
cholmondeley
street
or
as
near
thereto
as
possible
i
wish
to
goodness
we
had
put
it
in
said
daphne
it
done
now
said
her
husband
and
we
better
get
ready
i
turn
them
down
in
the
library
you
can
stand
behind
the
in
the
and
fire
them
from
there
and
boy
better
go
down
the
queue
with
some
oranges
and
a
megaphone
and
keep
on
saying
we
suited
right
up
to
the
last
in
silence
i
turned
to
the
sideboard
it
was
with
something
of
an
effort
that
i
helped
myself
to
a
thick
slab
of
bacon
which
was
obviously
but
from
the
bottom
of
a
second
dish
a
black
and
white
egg
with
a
pale
green
yoke
eyed
me
with
a
cold
stare
with
a
shudder
i
covered
it
up
again
after
all
we
did
want
a
cook
and
if
we
were
bombarded
with
applications
for
the
post
the
probability
of
getting
a
good
one
was
the
more
certain
as
i
took
my
seat
is
katharine
advertisement
in
i
asked
my
sister
nodded
she
put
her
telephone
number
too
has
she
she
will
be
mad
when
she
sees
we
had
the
same
idea
ah
said
berry
i
forgotten
the
telephone
that
another
vulnerable
spot
i
should
wonder
if
the
sentence
was
never
finished
the
hurried
stammer
of
the
telephone
bell
made
a
dramatic
irruption
and
jill
who
was
in
the
act
of
drinking
choked
with
excitement
in
silence
we
listened
to
be
quite
sure
a
second
prolonged
vibration
left
no
room
for
doubt
they
off
said
berry
i
i
feel
quite
nervous
said
daphne
let
falcon
answer
it
but
jill
was
already
at
the
door
breathlessly
we
awaited
her
return
nobby
apparently
affected
by
the
electricity
with
which
the
air
was
charged
started
to
relieve
his
feelings
by
barking
stormily
the
nervous
outburst
of
reproof
which
greeted
his
eloquence
was
so
unexpectedly
menacing
that
he
retired
precipitately
beneath
the
table
his
small
white
tail
clapped
incontinently
between
his
legs
the
next
moment
jill
tore
into
the
room
it
a
cook
she
cried
in
a
tempestuous
whisper
it
a
cook
she
wants
to
speak
to
daphne
it
a
trunk
call
she
rung
up
from
torquay
torquay
i
cried
aghast
good
heavens
what
did
i
say
said
berry
my
sister
rose
in
some
trepidation
two
hundred
miles
is
nothing
have
another
hunk
of
toast
it
was
only
made
on
sunday
so
i
can
recommend
it
daphne
hastened
from
the
room
with
jill
twittering
at
her
heels
and
in
some
dudgeon
i
cut
myself
a
slice
of
bread
berry
turned
his
attention
to
the
sealyham
nobby
my
lad
come
here
signifying
his
delight
at
this
restoration
to
favour
by
an
unusually
elaborate
rotatory
movement
of
his
tail
the
terrier
emerged
from
his
cover
and
humbled
himself
at
his
patron
feet
the
latter
picked
him
up
and
set
him
upon
his
knee
my
lad
he
said
this
is
going
to
be
a
momentous
day
cooks
meet
to
be
bitten
are
due
to
arrive
in
myriads
be
ruthless
spare
neither
the
matron
nor
the
maid
what
did
henry
say
in
this
day
is
call
the
feast
of
sealyham
she
that
outlives
this
day
and
comes
safe
home
will
sit
with
caution
when
this
day
is
named
and
shudder
at
the
name
of
sealyham
she
that
shall
live
this
day
and
see
old
age
will
yearly
on
the
razzle
feast
her
neighbours
and
say
is
saint
sealyham
then
will
she
strip
her
hose
and
show
her
scars
and
say
wounds
i
had
on
nobby
day
old
cooks
forget
yet
all
shall
be
forgot
but
she
remember
with
a
flood
of
talk
what
feats
you
did
that
day
nobby
licked
his
face
enthusiastically
then
came
a
swift
rush
across
the
hall
and
daphne
and
jill
pelted
into
the
room
she
coming
up
for
an
interview
panted
the
latter
six
years
in
her
last
place
but
the
people
are
going
abroad
if
we
engage
her
she
can
come
on
monday
sixty
pounds
a
year
daphne
was
beaming
i
must
say
i
liked
the
sound
of
her
very
respectful
she
seemed
her
name
rather
unusual
but
that
is
her
fault
pauline
roper
i
fancy
she
by
way
of
being
an
expert
she
got
a
certificate
from
some
institute
of
cookery
and
her
sister
a
trained
nurse
in
welbeck
street
that
why
she
wants
to
be
in
london
what
the
return
fare
from
torquay
she
added
i
said
i
pay
it
if
i
took
up
her
reference
oh
something
under
five
pounds
said
berry
what
my
dear
said
her
husband
if
the
expenditure
of
that
sum
were
to
ensure
me
a
breakfast
the
very
sight
of
which
did
not
make
my
gorge
rise
i
should
regard
it
as
a
trustee
investment
reference
to
a
showed
that
the
price
of
pauline
ticket
would
be
two
pounds
nine
shillings
and
fourpence
halfpenny
somewhat
to
our
surprise
and
greatly
to
our
relief
the
day
passed
without
another
application
for
the
post
of
cook
personal
or
otherwise
to
celebrate
the
solitary
but
promising
response
to
our
signal
and
the
prospect
which
it
afforded
of
an
early
deliverance
from
our
state
we
dined
at
the
and
went
to
the
play
on
returning
home
we
found
a
telegram
in
the
hall
it
had
been
handed
in
at
paris
and
ran
as
follows
called
camille
françois
leaving
for
cholmondeley
street
aaa
can
speak
no
english
so
must
be
met
at
dover
aaa
boat
due
aaa
the
train
roared
through
ashford
and
berry
looked
at
his
watch
then
he
sighed
profoundly
and
began
to
commune
with
himself
in
a
low
tone
pardons
madame
mais
vous
êtes
camille
françois
non
quel
dommage
dix
mille
pardons
deuce
of
a
lot
of
are
there
i
wonder
if
there
be
many
passengers
and
will
she
come
or
before
the
mast
you
know
this
is
a
wild
mare
chest
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
we
shall
insult
several
hundred
women
miss
the
cook
and
probably
lose
pauline
into
the
bargain
what
did
i
come
for
nonsense
said
jill
stoutly
jonah
told
her
to
look
out
for
us
i
bet
he
never
thought
i
should
be
fool
enough
to
roll
up
so
she
wo
expect
me
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
he
described
any
one
probably
drawn
a
lifelike
of
daphne
it
no
good
worrying
said
i
the
only
thing
to
do
is
to
address
every
woman
who
looks
in
the
least
like
a
cook
as
she
steps
off
the
gangway
when
we
do
strike
her
jill
can
carry
on
it
all
very
well
said
berry
but
what
does
a
cook
look
like
or
look
least
like
or
least
look
like
i
suppose
you
know
what
you
mean
jill
began
to
shake
with
laughter
she
probably
be
all
dressed
up
to
give
us
a
treat
and
for
all
we
know
she
may
have
a
child
with
her
and
if
she
pretty
it
a
hundred
to
one
some
fellow
will
be
seeing
her
off
the
boat
you
ca
rule
out
any
one
and
to
accost
strange
women
indiscriminately
is
simply
asking
for
trouble
understand
this
when
i
been
knocked
down
twice
you
can
count
me
out
this
was
too
much
for
jill
who
made
no
further
efforts
to
restrain
her
merriment
fixing
her
with
a
sorrowful
look
my
sank
back
in
his
corner
with
a
resigned
air
jonah
telegram
had
certainly
complicated
matters
we
had
received
it
too
late
to
prevent
the
dispatch
of
the
cook
whose
services
he
had
apparently
enlisted
after
a
prolonged
discussion
we
had
decided
that
while
daphne
must
stay
and
interview
pauline
roper
the
rest
of
us
had
better
proceed
to
dover
with
the
object
of
meeting
the
boat
it
was
obvious
that
jill
must
go
to
deal
with
the
immigrant
when
the
latter
had
been
identified
but
she
could
not
be
expected
to
effect
the
identification
i
was
unanimously
chosen
for
this
responsible
task
but
i
refused
to
make
the
attempt
i
argued
with
reason
that
it
was
more
than
one
man
could
do
and
that
the
performance
of
what
was
after
all
a
highly
delicate
operation
must
be
shared
by
berry
after
a
titanic
struggle
the
latter
gave
in
with
the
result
that
jill
and
he
and
i
had
left
london
by
the
eleven
train
this
was
due
to
arrive
at
dover
at
two
minutes
to
one
so
that
we
should
have
time
for
lunch
and
to
spare
before
the
boat
came
in
but
that
was
not
all
the
coming
of
jonah
made
it
impossible
for
my
sister
to
engage
pauline
roper
out
of
hand
of
course
the
latter
might
prove
impossible
which
in
a
way
would
simplify
the
position
if
as
was
more
probable
she
seemed
desirable
the
only
thing
to
do
was
to
pay
her
fare
and
promise
to
let
her
know
within
hours
whether
we
would
engage
her
or
not
that
would
give
us
time
to
discover
whether
camille
françois
was
the
more
promising
of
the
two
whatever
happened
it
was
painfully
clear
that
our
engagement
of
a
cook
was
going
to
prove
one
of
the
most
costly
adventures
of
its
kind
upon
which
we
had
ever
embarked
the
train
steamed
into
dover
one
minute
before
its
scheduled
time
and
we
immediately
repaired
to
the
lord
warden
hotel
lunch
was
followed
by
a
comfortable
in
the
lounge
after
which
we
decided
to
take
the
air
until
the
arrival
of
the
packet
perhaps
the
most
famous
of
the
gates
of
england
dover
has
always
worn
a
warlike
mien
less
formidable
than
renowned
gibraltar
there
is
a
look
of
grim
efficiency
about
her
heights
an
air
of
masked
authority
about
the
windy
galleries
hung
in
her
cold
grey
chalk
something
of
roman
competence
about
the
proud
old
gatehouse
on
the
castle
hill
never
in
mufti
never
in
gaudy
uniform
dover
is
always
clad
in
service
dress
a
thousand
threats
have
made
her
porterage
a
downright
office
bluntly
performed
and
so
those
four
lean
years
that
whipped
the
smile
from
many
an
english
hundred
seem
to
have
passed
over
the
grizzled
gate
like
the
east
wind
leaving
it
scatheless
about
herself
no
change
was
visible
as
we
leaned
easily
upon
the
giant
parapet
of
the
admiralty
pier
watching
the
tireless
waves
dance
to
the
of
wind
and
sun
there
was
but
little
evidence
to
show
that
the
portcullis
recently
hoist
had
for
four
years
been
down
under
the
shadow
of
the
shakespeare
cliff
the
busy
traffic
of
impatient
peace
fretted
as
heretofore
the
bristling
sentinels
were
gone
no
craft
sang
through
the
empty
air
no
desperate
call
for
labour
wearied
tired
eyes
clawed
at
strained
nerves
hastened
the
scurrying
feet
no
longer
from
across
the
straits
came
flickering
the
ceaseless
grunt
and
grumble
of
the
guns
the
wondrous
tales
of
nets
of
passages
of
arms
of
sallies
made
at
dawn
mortal
immortal
exploits
seemed
to
be
chronicles
of
another
age
the
ways
and
means
of
war
so
lately
paramount
were
out
of
sight
as
in
the
days
before
the
march
of
trade
and
caravan
of
pleasure
jostled
each
other
in
the
gate
mouth
only
the
soldierly
aspect
of
the
place
remained
might
in
a
faded
surcoat
her
shabby
scabbard
hiding
a
loose
bright
blade
the
steamer
was
up
to
time
when
four
came
she
was
well
in
sight
and
at
fourteen
minutes
past
the
hour
the
rattle
of
the
came
to
a
sudden
stop
and
a
moment
later
the
gangways
were
thrust
and
hauled
into
their
respective
positions
berry
and
i
stood
as
close
to
the
actual
points
of
disembarkation
as
convenience
and
discretion
allowed
while
jill
hovered
excitedly
in
the
background
as
the
passengers
began
to
descend
now
for
it
said
my
settling
his
hat
upon
his
head
i
feel
extremely
nervous
and
more
ill
at
ease
than
i
can
ever
remember
my
mind
is
a
seething
blank
and
i
think
my
left
is
coming
down
however
of
course
it
is
beginning
to
be
forcibly
what
they
call
in
upon
me
that
we
ought
to
have
brought
some
barbed
wire
and
a
turnstile
as
it
is
we
shall
miss
about
of
them
here
your
chance
he
added
nodding
at
a
stout
lady
with
a
green
and
a
defiant
glare
i
take
the
jug
and
bottle
department
i
had
just
time
to
see
that
the
object
of
his
irreverence
was
an
angular
female
with
a
brown
paper
parcel
and
a
tumbler
when
my
quarry
gained
and
started
in
the
direction
of
the
train
i
raised
my
hat
madame
mais
vous
êtes
reeang
was
the
discomfiting
reply
par
de
baggarge
i
realized
that
an
offer
which
i
had
not
made
had
been
rejected
and
that
the
speaker
was
not
of
french
descent
the
sting
of
the
rebuff
was
greatly
tempered
by
the
reception
with
which
berry
advances
were
met
i
was
too
late
to
hear
what
he
had
said
but
the
resentment
which
his
attempt
had
provoked
was
disconcertingly
obvious
after
fixing
my
with
a
freezing
stare
his
addressee
turned
as
from
an
offensive
odour
and
invested
the
one
word
she
thought
fit
to
employ
with
an
essence
of
loathing
which
was
terrible
to
hear
disgusting
berry
shook
his
head
the
right
word
he
said
was
he
turned
to
accost
a
girl
wearing
an
gaberdine
and
very
clearly
born
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
channel
with
a
sigh
i
addressed
myself
to
a
widow
with
a
small
boy
clad
in
a
to
my
embarrassment
she
proved
to
be
deaf
but
when
i
had
stumblingly
repeated
my
absurd
interrogation
she
denied
the
impeachment
with
a
charming
smile
during
our
exchange
of
courtesies
the
child
stood
staring
at
me
with
a
finger
deep
in
his
mouth
at
their
conclusion
he
withdrew
this
and
pointed
it
directly
at
my
chin
coupé
maman
he
demanded
in
a
piercing
treble
the
question
was
appropriate
but
unanswerable
his
mother
lugged
him
incontinently
away
berry
was
confronting
one
of
the
largest
ladies
i
have
ever
seen
as
he
began
to
speak
she
interrupted
him
êtes
meestair
baxtair
pas
ah
bien
ça
si
peur
de
ne
pas
vous
trouver
mais
maintenant
je
suis
tranquille
mon
mari
me
suit
ah
le
voilà
she
turned
about
the
better
to
beckon
to
a
huge
man
with
two
bags
and
a
beneath
the
avalanche
of
berry
stood
paralysed
recognizing
that
something
must
be
done
i
sought
to
interfere
leave
me
alone
said
berry
weakly
i
i
got
off
it
took
all
my
energy
and
most
of
my
french
to
convince
his
that
she
was
mistaken
during
the
interlude
about
fifteen
possibles
escaped
us
i
threw
a
despairing
glance
in
jill
direction
wiped
the
sweat
from
my
brow
and
returned
to
the
attack
after
four
more
failures
my
nerve
began
to
go
miserably
i
turned
to
my
he
was
in
the
act
of
addressing
a
girl
in
black
bearing
a
valise
and
some
wilting
roses
before
she
had
had
time
to
appreciate
his
inquiry
there
was
a
choking
yell
from
the
gangway
and
a
very
dark
gentleman
with
an
italian
cast
of
countenance
thrust
his
explosive
way
on
to
the
pier
my
knowledge
of
his
native
tongue
was
limited
to
and
one
or
two
musical
directions
but
from
the
vehemence
of
his
tone
and
the
violence
of
his
dramatic
gestures
it
was
plain
that
the
torrent
which
foamed
from
his
lips
was
both
menacing
and
abusive
from
the
shape
of
the
case
which
he
was
clutching
beneath
his
left
arm
i
judged
him
to
be
an
exponent
of
the
guitar
advancing
his
nose
to
within
an
inch
and
a
half
of
berry
chin
he
blared
and
raved
like
a
maniac
alternately
pointing
to
his
shrinking
and
indicating
the
blue
vault
of
heaven
with
frightful
emphasis
berry
regarded
him
unperturbed
as
he
paused
for
breath
in
answer
to
your
observations
he
said
i
can
only
say
that
i
am
not
a
mormon
and
have
absolutely
no
connection
with
salt
lake
city
i
may
add
that
if
you
are
partial
to
garlic
it
is
a
taste
which
i
have
never
acquired
in
conclusion
i
hope
that
before
you
reach
the
platform
for
which
you
are
apparently
making
you
will
stumble
over
one
of
the
ridiculously
large
rings
with
which
the
quay
is
so
generously
provided
and
will
not
only
suffer
the
most
hideous
agony
but
remain
permanently
lame
as
a
result
of
your
carelessness
the
calm
dignity
with
which
he
delivered
this
speech
had
an
almost
magical
effect
upon
the
jealous
latin
his
bluster
sank
suddenly
and
died
muttering
to
himself
and
staring
at
berry
as
at
a
wizard
he
seized
the
girl
by
the
arm
and
started
to
move
rapidly
away
and
ill
at
ease
with
suppressed
excitement
and
the
tail
of
my
eye
i
watched
him
bear
down
upon
one
of
the
to
which
berry
had
referred
the
accuracy
with
which
he
approached
it
was
almost
uncanny
i
found
myself
standing
upon
one
leg
the
screech
of
anguish
with
which
he
hailed
the
collision
no
less
than
the
precipitancy
with
which
he
dropped
the
guitar
sat
down
and
began
to
rock
himself
to
and
fro
was
irresistibly
gratifying
the
muscles
about
berry
mouth
twitched
so
perish
all
traitors
he
said
and
now
i
do
know
how
you
feel
but
i
had
about
enough
of
this
my
nerves
are
what
they
were
something
may
snap
any
minute
with
one
accord
we
proceeded
to
rejoin
jill
who
had
been
witnessing
our
humiliations
from
a
safe
distance
and
was
dabbing
her
grey
eyes
with
a
ridiculous
handkerchief
as
we
came
up
she
started
forward
and
pointed
a
trembling
finger
in
the
direction
of
the
boat
berry
and
i
swung
on
our
heels
looking
very
well
jonah
was
descending
the
gangway
with
a
bored
air
my
and
i
stared
at
him
as
at
one
risen
from
the
dead
almost
at
once
he
saw
us
and
waved
airily
a
moment
later
he
limped
to
where
we
were
standing
and
kissed
his
sister
i
had
an
idea
some
of
you
turn
up
he
said
coolly
berry
turned
to
me
you
hear
he
said
grimly
he
had
an
idea
some
of
us
turn
up
an
idea
i
suppose
a
little
bird
told
him
oh
take
me
away
somebody
and
let
me
die
let
me
have
one
last
imitation
meal
and
die
where
do
they
sell
wild
oats
jonah
disregarded
the
interruption
at
the
last
moment
he
said
calmly
i
felt
there
might
be
some
so
i
came
along
too
he
turned
and
nodded
at
a
nervous
little
man
who
was
standing
a
few
paces
away
and
as
i
now
observed
for
the
first
time
carrying
my
cousin
that
he
added
is
camille
his
momentous
announcement
rendered
us
speechless
at
length
you
you
mean
to
say
i
gasped
that
that
it
a
man
jonah
shrugged
his
shoulders
look
at
his
trousers
he
said
but
but
of
course
we
expected
a
woman
cried
jill
in
a
choking
voice
we
ca
have
a
nothing
said
jonah
was
said
about
sex
berry
spoke
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
a
man
he
said
a
called
and
it
actually
occurred
to
you
that
might
be
some
you
know
your
intuition
is
positively
supernatural
and
it
is
for
this
he
added
bitterly
that
i
have
dissipated
in
ten
crowded
minutes
a
reputation
which
it
has
taken
years
to
amass
it
is
for
this
that
i
have
deliberately
insulted
several
respectable
ladies
jeopardized
the
and
invited
personal
violence
of
a
most
unpleasant
character
to
do
this
i
shall
have
travelled
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
with
the
shade
temperature
at
ninety
and
lost
what
would
have
been
an
undoubtedly
pleasant
and
possibly
extremely
fruitful
day
at
sandown
park
do
be
afraid
i
would
touch
you
for
worlds
you
being
reserved
for
some
very
special
form
of
dissolution
you
are
or
something
i
should
avoid
woods
any
way
and
now
i
going
home
i
shall
start
on
a
walking
tour
with
a
spare
sock
and
some
milk
chocolate
and
try
to
forget
if
that
fails
i
shall
take
the
snail
i
mean
the
veil
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
stalked
haughtily
in
the
direction
of
the
boat
train
gurgling
with
merriment
jill
laid
a
hand
on
my
arm
daphne
will
simply
scream
she
said
if
this
little
stunt
has
cost
us
pauline
said
i
she
wo
leave
it
at
that
we
turned
to
follow
my
jonah
beckoned
to
camille
restez
près
de
moi
he
said
on
arriving
at
charing
cross
we
left
jonah
and
the
cook
to
weather
the
customs
and
drove
straight
to
cholmondeley
street
as
we
entered
the
hall
my
sister
came
flying
out
of
the
library
hello
she
cried
where
the
cook
do
say
berry
uncovered
madame
he
said
vous
êtes
camille
your
cue
now
you
say
just
like
that
put
all
the
loathing
you
can
into
it
you
find
it
can
hold
quite
a
lot
and
fix
me
with
a
glassy
eye
then
i
blench
and
break
out
into
a
cold
sweat
oh
it
a
great
game
poor
old
chap
said
daphne
it
must
have
been
awful
but
have
you
got
her
it
a
he
cried
jill
squeaking
with
excitement
it
a
he
bringing
him
a
said
my
sister
taking
a
pace
backward
a
male
said
i
you
know
like
nobby
separate
legs
and
shaves
on
thursdays
do
you
mean
to
say
that
it
a
i
nodded
my
sister
collapsed
into
a
convenient
chair
and
closed
her
eyes
presently
she
began
to
shake
with
laughter
it
is
droll
is
it
said
berry
people
would
believe
it
fancy
travelling
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
molest
a
lot
of
strange
women
and
then
finding
that
for
all
the
good
you
done
you
might
as
well
have
spent
the
day
advertising
for
lost
chord
my
sister
pulled
herself
together
thank
goodness
i
had
the
sense
to
engage
pauline
she
announced
something
told
me
i
better
but
i
waited
before
taking
up
her
reference
on
the
of
this
one
being
a
marvel
where
is
the
wretched
man
jonah
fetched
up
with
him
he
stayed
behind
because
of
the
customs
they
ought
to
be
here
any
minute
well
there
no
place
for
him
to
sleep
here
said
daphne
fitch
will
have
to
look
after
him
for
tonight
and
he
have
to
go
back
berry
looked
at
his
watch
five
past
seven
he
said
as
the
blighter
here
why
not
let
him
the
dinner
it
shorten
his
life
but
it
may
save
ours
you
never
know
my
sister
hesitated
then
he
never
do
it
she
said
i
can
suggest
it
but
if
he
anything
of
a
cook
he
go
off
the
deep
end
at
once
and
give
notice
said
i
well
that
exactly
what
we
want
then
we
sha
have
to
fire
him
he
can
just
push
off
quietly
pauline
will
roll
up
on
monday
and
everything
will
be
lovely
in
the
garden
that
it
said
berry
if
he
consents
well
and
good
if
he
declines
so
much
the
better
it
a
blinkin
certainty
whichever
happens
we
ca
lose
all
right
said
daphne
i
shall
make
jonah
tell
him
it
took
jonah
and
françois
longer
to
satisfy
the
officers
of
his
majesty
customs
and
excise
than
we
had
anticipated
and
i
had
consumed
a
whisky
and
soda
and
was
on
the
way
to
the
bathroom
when
i
heard
them
arrive
before
i
had
completed
a
leisurely
toilet
it
was
all
over
as
we
waited
in
the
lounge
of
the
grill
for
a
table
which
we
had
been
too
late
to
reserve
my
sister
related
the
circumstances
which
had
led
to
the
the
wretched
little
man
did
seem
to
take
to
the
idea
of
starting
in
right
away
but
i
explained
that
he
need
do
any
more
than
just
run
his
eye
over
the
and
that
as
they
were
going
to
have
the
same
dinner
in
the
servants
hall
it
really
only
amounted
to
looking
after
his
own
food
then
i
sent
for
falcon
explained
things
and
told
him
to
look
after
the
man
this
evening
and
that
i
was
making
arrangements
for
him
to
stay
with
fitch
over
the
garage
then
i
had
chapel
up
that
i
take
it
said
berry
is
the
nymph
lately
responsible
for
the
preparation
of
our
food
daphne
nodded
i
told
her
about
françois
and
that
as
he
was
here
he
would
help
her
with
dinner
i
said
he
was
very
clever
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
that
i
wanted
her
to
show
him
what
she
was
cooking
and
listen
to
any
suggestions
he
had
to
make
i
suppose
you
added
that
he
could
speak
a
word
of
english
said
her
husband
be
quiet
said
daphne
besides
he
can
several
words
any
way
she
did
seem
but
as
pauline
coming
on
monday
that
did
worry
me
so
i
sent
her
away
and
rang
up
fitch
and
told
him
he
must
fix
the
frenchman
up
for
the
night
did
he
seem
i
did
wait
to
hear
i
just
rang
off
quick
then
i
went
up
to
dress
the
next
thing
i
knew
was
that
they
tried
to
murder
each
other
and
that
camille
had
bitten
william
and
nobby
bitten
camille
i
suppose
we
shall
ever
know
exactly
what
happened
so
far
as
we
had
been
able
to
gather
from
the
butler
who
had
immediately
repaired
to
daphne
room
for
instructions
and
was
labouring
under
great
excitement
my
sister
orders
had
been
but
grudgingly
obeyed
chapel
had
been
and
obstructive
and
had
made
no
attempt
to
disguise
her
suspicion
of
the
the
latter
had
consequently
determined
to
be
as
nasty
as
the
circumstances
allowed
had
eyed
her
preparations
for
dinner
with
a
marked
contempt
and
had
communed
visibly
and
audibly
with
himself
in
a
manner
which
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
finally
he
had
desired
to
taste
the
soup
which
she
was
cooking
poor
as
his
english
was
his
meaning
was
apparent
but
the
charwoman
had
affected
an
utter
inability
to
understand
what
he
said
this
had
so
much
incensed
the
frenchman
that
the
other
servants
had
intervened
and
insisted
on
compliance
with
his
request
with
an
ill
grace
she
snatched
the
lid
from
the
saucepan
everything
was
now
in
train
for
a
frightful
explosion
in
bitterness
the
fuse
had
been
laid
the
charge
of
passion
was
tamped
the
detonator
of
spleen
was
in
position
only
a
match
was
necessary
camille
françois
however
preferred
to
employ
a
torch
after
allowing
the
fluid
to
cool
the
frenchman
by
this
time
the
cynosure
of
sixteen
vigilant
eyes
introduced
a
teaspoonful
into
his
mouth
the
most
sanguine
member
of
his
audience
was
hardly
expecting
him
to
commend
the
beverage
chapel
herself
must
have
felt
instinctively
that
no
man
born
of
woman
would
in
the
circumstances
renounce
such
a
magnificent
opportunity
of
getting
back
nobody
however
was
apparently
prepared
for
so
vigorous
and
dramatic
an
appreciation
of
the
dainty
for
the
space
of
two
seconds
the
held
it
cupped
in
his
mouth
then
with
an
expression
of
deadly
loathing
intensified
by
a
horrible
squint
he
expelled
the
liquid
on
to
the
kitchen
floor
ignoring
the
gasp
which
greeted
his
action
he
was
observed
to
shrug
his
shoulders
i
veep
my
eyes
he
announced
for
ze
pore
pig
here
the
steady
flood
of
the
butler
narrative
became
excusably
broken
into
the
incoherence
of
rapids
and
the
decent
reticence
of
disappearing
falls
beyond
the
fact
that
chapel
had
swung
twice
to
the
jaw
and
that
camille
had
replied
with
an
ineffectual
kick
before
they
were
dragged
screaming
apart
few
details
of
the
state
of
pandemonium
that
ensued
came
to
our
ears
i
imagine
that
a
striking
somewhat
on
the
lines
of
meissonier
famous
painting
was
unconsciously
improvised
that
three
maids
hardly
restrained
chapel
that
the
footman
who
sought
to
withhold
camille
was
bitten
for
his
pains
by
the
now
ravening
frenchman
that
the
latter
was
only
saved
from
the
commission
of
a
still
more
aggravated
assault
by
the
timely
arrival
of
the
butler
that
nobby
attracted
by
the
uproar
contributed
to
the
confusion
first
by
barking
like
a
demoniac
and
then
by
inflicting
a
punctured
wound
upon
the
calf
of
the
alien
leg
we
learned
more
by
inference
and
deduction
than
by
direct
report
that
our
impending
meal
would
be
more
than
usually
unappetizing
was
never
suggested
that
was
surmise
upon
our
part
pure
and
simple
the
conviction
however
was
so
strong
that
the
repast
was
cancelled
out
of
hand
chapel
was
dismissed
and
straitly
charged
never
to
return
camille
was
placed
in
the
custody
of
the
chauffeur
and
escorted
to
the
rooms
above
the
garage
to
be
returned
to
france
upon
the
following
morning
nobby
was
commended
for
his
discrimination
jonah
was
reviled
all
this
however
took
time
the
respective
dismissal
and
disposal
of
the
combatants
were
not
completed
until
long
past
eight
and
it
was
almost
nine
before
we
sat
down
to
dinner
i
think
said
daphne
faintly
i
should
like
some
champagne
berry
ordered
the
wine
it
was
abnormally
hot
and
the
doors
that
were
usually
closed
were
set
wide
open
from
the
street
faint
snatches
of
a
vibrant
soprano
came
knocking
at
our
tired
ears
mechanically
we
listened
you
come
to
the
end
of
a
perfect
day
berry
turned
to
me
they
must
have
seen
us
come
in
he
said
it
was
with
a
grateful
heart
that
i
telegraphed
the
first
thing
on
saturday
morning
to
hamilton
smythe
of
fair
lawns
torquay
asking
forma
whether
pauline
roper
now
in
her
service
was
sober
honest
and
generally
to
be
recommended
to
be
engaged
as
cook
as
she
had
been
for
six
years
with
the
lady
and
was
only
leaving
because
the
latter
was
quitting
england
to
join
her
husband
in
ceylon
it
was
improbable
that
the
reference
would
be
unflattering
moreover
daphne
had
taken
to
her
at
once
quiet
decently
attired
and
respectful
she
was
obviously
a
long
way
superior
to
the
ordinary
maid
indeed
she
had
admitted
that
her
father
now
dead
had
been
a
clergyman
and
that
she
should
have
endeavoured
to
obtain
a
position
as
governess
if
as
a
child
she
had
received
anything
better
than
the
rudest
education
she
had
she
added
been
receiving
fifty
pounds
a
year
hesitatingly
she
had
inquired
whether
since
the
employment
was
only
temporary
we
should
consider
an
increase
of
ten
pounds
a
year
unreasonable
altogether
concluded
my
sister
a
thoroughly
woman
i
offered
her
lunch
but
she
said
she
was
anxious
to
try
and
see
her
sister
before
she
caught
her
train
back
so
she
did
have
any
i
almost
forgot
to
give
her
her
fare
poor
girl
in
fact
she
had
to
remind
me
she
apologized
very
humbly
but
said
the
journey
to
london
was
so
terribly
expensive
that
she
simply
could
afford
to
let
it
stand
over
we
had
lunched
at
ranelagh
and
were
sitting
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
pleasant
grounds
taking
our
ease
after
the
alarms
and
excursions
of
the
day
before
later
on
we
made
our
way
to
the
almost
the
first
person
we
saw
was
katharine
festival
hurray
said
daphne
i
meant
to
have
rung
her
up
last
night
but
what
with
the
camille
episode
and
dining
out
i
forgot
all
about
it
when
i
tell
her
we
suited
she
be
green
with
envy
her
unsuspecting
victim
advanced
beaming
being
of
the
opposite
sex
i
felt
sorry
for
her
daphne
my
dear
she
announced
i
meant
to
have
rung
you
up
last
night
i
got
a
cook
the
pendulum
of
my
emotions
described
the
best
part
of
a
semicircle
and
i
felt
sorry
for
daphne
i
am
glad
said
my
sister
with
an
audacity
which
took
my
breath
away
how
splendid
so
we
hurray
said
katharine
with
a

a
trembling
handkerchief
to
her
lips
i
paid

said
faintly

to
two
pounds
nine
and
four
pence
halfpenny

my
sister
i
gave
her
two
pounds
ten
so

i
said
katharine
she
was
to

on
monday
six
years

her
last
place

daphne

a
clergyman

wailed
katharine

up
her

last
night

the
reply
in
silence

down
but
but
stammered
jill

asked

jill

pauline

pauline

took
a
risk
and
got
away
with
it
i
feel
dazed
said
daphne
putting
a
hand
to
her
head
there
must
be
some
mistake
i
ca
believe
thoroughly
woman
said
berry
i
think
i
should
feel
nice
if
i
could
make
five
pounds
in
two
hours
by
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
and
saying
i
was
a
clergyman
daughter
and
now
what
are
we
going
to
do
shall
we
be
funny
and
inform
the
police
or
try
and
stop
camille

said
his
wife
because
i
ca
bear
it
jonah
for
goodness
sake
get
hold
of
the
car
and
let
go
yes
said
berry
and
look
sharp
about
it
time
getting
on
and
i
should
just
hate
to
be
late
for
dinner
or
shall
we
be
reckless
and
take
a
table
at
lockhart
we
drove
home
in
a
state
of
profound
melancholy
awaiting
our
arrival
was
a
service
communication
upon
a
buff
sheet
bluntly
addressed
to

how
jill
slept
undisturbed
and
nobby
attended
church
parade
what
do
said
berry
when
you
want
to
remember
something
change
my
rings
said
daphne
why
i
only
wondered
find
that
infallible
my
sister
nodded
absolutely
she
said
of
course
i
do
always
remember
what
changed
them
for
but
it
shows
me
there
something
i
forgotten
i
see
then
you
only
got
to
remember
what
that
is
and
there
you
are
why
do
i
wear
rings
change
your
shoes
instead
said
i
drowsily
or
wear
your
waistcoat
next
to
your
skin
then
whenever
you
want
to
look
at
your
watch
have
to
undress
that
make
you
think
you
go
and
change
your
face
said
berry
do
wait
for
something
to
remember
just
go
and
do
it
by
and
then
advertise
it
in
you
get
so
many
letters
of
gratitude
that
you
get
tired
of
answering
them
before
i
could
reply
to
this
insult
i
suppose
said
my
sister
this
means
that
you
ca
remember
something
which
concerns
me
and
really
matters
in
guilty
silence
her
husband
prepared
a
cigar
for
ignition
with
the
utmost
care
at
length
i
would
go
as
far
as
that
he
said
but
i
confess
that
at
the
back
of
my
mind
in
as
it
were
the
upper
reaches
of
my
memory
there
is
a
faint
ripple
of
suggestion
for
which
i
can
not
satisfactorily
account
now
is
that
beautifully
put
with
a
look
of
contempt
daphne
returned
to
the
digestion
of
a
letter
which
she
had
that
morning
received
from
the
united
states
reflectively
berry
struck
a
match
and
lighted
his
cigar
i
followed
the
example
of
jill
and
began
to
doze
with
the
exception
of
jonah
who
was
in
somerset
with
the
fairies
we
had
been
to
goodwood
i
had
driven
the
car
both
ways
and
was
healthily
tired
but
the
long
ride
had
rendered
us
all
weary
and
the
prospect
of
a
full
night
and
a
quiet
morrow
was
good
to
contemplate
on
the
following
tuesday
we
were
going
out
of
town
of
this
we
were
all
unfeignedly
glad
for
london
was
growing
stale
the
leaves
upon
her
trees
were
blown
and
dingy
odd
pieces
of
paper
crept
here
and
there
into
her
parks
the
dust
was
paramount
what
sultry
air
there
was
seemed
to
be
out
of
the
pounding
traffic
the
pungent
reek
of
oil
and
fiery
metal
rose
up
oppressive
paint
three
months
old
was
seamed
and
freckled
look
where
you
would
the
silver
sheen
of
spring
was
dull
and
tarnished
the
very
stones
were
shabby
and
in
the
summer
sunshine
even
proud
buildings
of
the
smartest
streets
wore
but
a
jaded
look
and
lost
their
dignity
the
vanity
of
bricks
stood
out
in
bold
relief
unsightly
dressing
the
gentle
argument
of
nature
with
such
authority
as
set
tired
senses
craving
the
airs
and
graces
of
the
countryside
and
mourning
the
traditions
of
the
children
of
men
adèle
said
daphne
suddenly
is
sailing
next
week
hurray
said
jill
waking
up
liverpool
or
southampton
said
i
she
does
say
but
i
told
her
to
come
to
southampton
i
expect
she
got
to
take
what
she
can
get
only
when
you
making
for
hampshire
it
seems
a
pity
to
go
round
by
the
mersey
i
like
adèle
said
berry
she
never
seeks
to
withstand
that
feeling
of
respect
which
i
inspire
when
with
me
she
recognizes
that
she
is
in
the
presence
of
a
holy
sage
and
as
it
were
treading
upon
hallowed
ground
woman
he
added
looking
sorrowfully
upon
his
wife
i
could
wish
that
something
of
her
piety
were
there
to
lessen
your
corruption
poor
vulgar
shrew
i
weep
she
says
something
about
you
said
daphne
turning
over
a
sheet
here
you
are
berry
my
love
if
i
been
with
you
at
oxford
when
he
got
busy
i
should
just
have
died
all
the
same
you
must
admit
he
a
scream
i
longing
to
see
nobby
he
sounds
as
if
he
were
a
dog
of
real
character
thank
you
said
her
husband
with
emotion
thank
you
very
much
scream
i
think
you
said
yes
and
nobby
dog
of
character
i
bear
it
so
he
is
said
i
exceptional
character
i
admit
said
berry
he
impartial
his
worst
enemy
ca
deny
that
his
offerings
at
the
shrine
of
gluttony
are
just
as
ample
as
those
he
lays
before
the
altar
of
sloth
all
dogs
are
greedy
said
jill
it
natural
and
you
be
tired
if
you
ran
about
like
him
he
useful
and
ornamental
and
diverting
said
i
i
do
know
what
more
you
want
useful
said
berry
with
a
yawn
useful
oh
you
mean
scavenging
but
then
you
discourage
him
so
remember
that
rotten
fish
in
brook
street
the
other
day
well
he
was
making
a
nice
clean
job
of
that
he
was
when
you
stopped
him
that
was
a
work
of
supererogation
i
maintain
however
that
nobody
can
justly
describe
nobby
as
a
useless
dog
for
instance
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
at
once
interrupted
and
upheld
my
contention
into
the
room
bustled
the
sealyham
the
personification
of
importance
with
tail
up
eyes
sparkling
and
gripped
in
his
large
mouth
the
letters
which
had
just
been
delivered
by
the
last
post
as
the
outburst
of
feminine
approval
subsided
out
of
his
own
mouth
said
i
you
stand
confuted
either
of
gallantry
or
because
her
welcome
was
the
more
compelling
the
terrier
made
straight
for
my
sister
and
pleasedly
delivered
his
burden
into
her
hands
of
the
three
letters
she
selected
two
and
then
making
much
of
the
dog
returned
a
foolscap
envelope
to
his
jaws
and
instructed
him
to
bear
it
to
berry
nobby
received
it
greedily
but
it
was
only
when
he
had
simultaneously
spun
into
the
air
growled
and
placing
an
emphatic
paw
upon
the
projecting
end
torn
the
letter
asunder
that
it
became
evident
that
he
was
regarding
her
return
of
the
missive
as
a
or
reward
of
his
diligence
with
a
cry
my
sprang
to
enlighten
him
but
nobby
hailing
his
action
as
the
first
move
in
a
game
of
great
promise
darted
out
of
his
reach
tore
round
the
room
at
express
speed
and
streaked
into
the
hall
by
dint
of
an
immediate
rush
to
the
library
door
we
were
just
in
time
to
see
berry
slip
on
the
parquet
and
falling
heavily
miss
the
terrier
by
what
was
a
matter
of
inches
and
by
the
time
we
had
helped
one
another
upstairs
the
medley
of
worrying
and
imprecations
which
emanated
from
daphne
bedroom
made
it
clear
that
the
quarry
had
gone
to
ground
as
we
drew
breath
in
the
doorway
get
him
from
the
other
side
yelled
berry
who
was
lying
flat
on
his
face
with
one
arm
under
the
bed
quick
it
may
be
unsporting
but
i
do
care
his
voice
rose
to
a
menacing
roar
as
the
rending
of
paper
became
distinctly
audible
stop
it
you
wicked
swine
hear
it
from
beneath
the
bed
a
further
burst
of
mischief
answered
him
once
again
feminine
subtlety
prevailed
where
the
straightforward
efforts
of
a
man
were
fruitless
as
i
flung
myself
down
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
bed
nobby
said
jill
in
a
stage
whisper
chocolates
the
terrier
paused
in
his
work
of
destruction
then
he
dropped
the
mangled
remains
of
the
letter
and
put
his
head
on
one
side
chocolates
the
next
second
he
was
scrambling
towards
the
foot
of
the
bed
i
gathered
together
the
and
rose
to
my
feet
nobby
was
sitting
up
in
front
of
jill
begging
irresistibly
what
a
shame
said
the
latter
and
i
have
any
for
you
and
if
i
had
i
might
give
you
them
she
looked
round
appealingly
is
he
cute
extraordinary
how
that
word
fetch
him
said
i
i
think
his
late
mistress
must
have
i
sure
she
must
said
berry
taking
the
ruins
of
his
correspondence
out
of
my
hand
perhaps
she
also
taught
him
to
collect
stamps
and
or
crests
and
do
you
mean
to
say
you
got
no
chocolates
for
him
how
shameful
i
better
run
round
and
knock
up
gunter
shall
i
slip
on
a
coat
or
will
the
parquet
do
there
no
vice
in
him
i
said
shakily
it
was
a
misunderstanding
with
an
awful
look
berry
gingerly
withdrew
from
what
remained
of
the
envelope
some
of
a
dilapidated
dividend
warrant
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
immersed
in
water
and
angrily
disputed
by
a
number
of
rats
it
it
all
right
i
said
unsteadily
the
company
give
you
another
give
me
air
said
berry
weakly
open
the
wardrobe
somebody
and
give
me
air
you
know
this
is
the
violation
of
belgium
over
again
the
little
angel
must
have
been
the
mascot
of
a
jaeger
battalion
in
full
blast
with
a
shaking
finger
he
indicated
the
cheque
bearing
this
in
mind
which
would
you
say
he
was
useful
or
ornamental
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
said
i
merely
diverting
expectantly
my
regarded
the
ceiling
i
wonder
what
holding
it
he
said
i
suppose
the
whitewash
has
seized
and
now
if
you
assist
me
downstairs
and
apply
the
usual
restoratives
i
forgive
you
the
two
pounds
i
owe
you
there
a
letter
i
want
to
write
before
i
retire
half
an
hour
later
the
following
letter
was
dispatched
enclosed
are
as
a
patient
scrutiny
will
reveal
the
remains
of
a
dividend
warrant
in
my
favour
for
pounds
five
to
its
dilapidation
which
you
will
observe
includes
the
total
loss
of
the
date
signature
and
stamp
i
am
forced
to
the
reluctant
conclusion
that
your
bankers
will
show
a
marked
disinclination
to
honour
what
was
once
a
valuable
reduction
to
the
lamentable
condition
in
which
you
now
see
it
is
due
to
the
barbarous
treatment
it
received
at
the
teeth
and
claws
of
a
dog
or
hound
which
i
regret
to
say
has
recently
frequented
this
house
and
is
indubitably
possessed
of
a
malignant
fairness
to
myself
i
must
add
first
that
it
was
through
no
improvidence
on
my
part
that
the
domestic
animal
above
referred
to
obtained
possession
of
the
document
and
secondly
that
i
made
such
desperate
efforts
to
recover
it
intact
as
resulted
in
my
sustaining
a
fall
of
considerable
violence
upon
one
of
the
least
resilient
floors
i
have
ever
encountered
if
you
do
not
believe
me
your
duly
accredited
representative
is
at
liberty
to
inspect
the
many
and
various
contusions
upon
my
person
any
day
between
ten
and
eleven
at
the
above
address
yours
faithfully
my
has
just
read
this
through
and
says
i
left
out
something
i
think
the
is
being
funny
but
i
just
mention
it
in
it
just
occurred
to
me
that
the
fool
means
i
have
asked
you
to
send
me
another
one
but
you
will
wo
you
for
no
apparent
reason
i
was
suddenly
awake
invariably
a
sound
sleeper
i
lay
for
a
moment
pondering
the
phenomenon
then
a
low
growl
from
the
foot
of
the
bed
furnished
one
explanation
only
to
demand
another
i
put
up
a
groping
hand
and
felt
for
the
dangling
switch
for
a
moment
i
fumbled
then
from
above
my
head
a
lamp
flung
a
sudden
restricted
light
on
to
the
bed
i
raised
myself
on
an
elbow
and
looked
at
nobby
his
body
was
still
curled
with
his
small
strong
legs
tucked
out
of
sight
but
his
head
was
raised
and
he
was
listening
intently
i
put
my
head
on
one
side
and
did
the
same
only
the
hoot
of
a
belated
car
faintly
disturbed
the
silence
i
looked
at
my
this
showed
one
minute
to
one
as
i
raised
my
eyes
an
impatient
clock
somewhere
confirmed
its
tale
with
a
yawn
i
conjured
the
terrier
to
go
to
sleep
and
reached
for
the
switch
as
i
did
so
he
growled
again
with
my
fingers
about
the
push
i
hesitated
straining
my
ears
the
next
moment
i
was
out
of
bed
and
fighting
my
way
into
my
while
nobby
his
black
nose
clapped
to
the
sill
of
the
doorway
stood
tense
and
rigid
and
motionless
as
death
as
i
picked
him
up
he
began
to
quiver
and
i
could
feel
his
heart
thumping
but
he
seemed
to
appreciate
the
necessity
for
silence
and
licked
my
face
noiselessly
i
switched
off
the
light
and
opened
the
door
there
was
a
lamp
burning
on
the
landing
and
i
stepped
directly
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
except
that
there
was
a
faint
light
somewhere
upon
the
ground
floor
i
could
see
nothing
but
as
i
stood
peering
the
sound
of
a
stealthy
movement
followed
by
the
low
grumble
of
utterance
rose
unmistakably
to
my
ears
under
my
left
arm
nobby
stiffened
notably
for
a
moment
i
stood
listening
and
thinking
furiously
it
was
plain
that
there
was
more
than
one
visitor
for
burglars
do
not
talk
to
themselves
and
discretion
suggested
that
i
should
seek
assistance
before
descending
jonah
was
out
of
town
the
slept
in
the
basement
the
telephone
was
downstairs
only
berry
remained
the
faint
chink
of
metal
meeting
metal
and
a
stifled
laugh
decided
me
with
the
utmost
caution
i
stole
to
the
door
of
my
sister
room
and
turned
the
handle
as
i
glided
into
the
chamber
who
that
came
in
a
startled
whisper
before
i
could
answer
there
was
a
quick
rustle
a
switch
clicked
and
there
was
daphne
propped
on
a
white
arm
looking
at
me
with
wide
eyes
and
parted
lips
her
beautiful
dark
hair
was
tumbling
about
her
breast
and
shoulders
impatiently
she
brushed
it
clear
of
her
face
what
is
it
boy
i
laid
a
finger
upon
my
lips
there
somebody
downstairs
wake
berry
slowly
her
husband
rolled
on
to
his
left
side
and
regarded
me
with
one
eye
what
he
said
is
the
meaning
of
this
intrusion
do
be
a
fool
i
whispered
the
house
is
being
burgled
gurgled
burgled
you
fool
no
such
word
said
berry
what
you
mean
is
rifled
and
then
you
wrong
why
there
nobby
i
could
have
stamped
with
vexation
my
sister
took
up
the
cudgels
do
lie
there
she
said
get
up
and
see
what
said
her
husband
what
going
on
berry
swallowed
before
replying
then
how
many
are
there
he
demanded
you
poisonous
idiot
i
hissed
i
tell
you
naughty
temper
said
berry
i
admit
i
in
the
wrong
but
there
you
are
you
see
it
all
comes
of
not
wearing
rings
if
i
did
i
should
have
remembered
that
a
wire
came
from
jonah
just
before
dinner
it
in
my
saying
he
was
coming
up
late
with
harry
and
that
if
the
latter
could
get
in
at
the
club
he
should
bring
him
on
here
he
had
the
decency
to
add
sit
up
daphne
and
i
exchanged
glances
of
withering
contempt
and
where
said
my
sister
is
harry
going
to
sleep
her
husband
settled
himself
contentedly
that
he
said
drowsily
is
what
worrying
me
outrageous
said
daphne
then
she
turned
to
me
it
too
late
to
do
anything
now
will
you
go
down
and
explain
perhaps
he
can
manage
in
the
library
unless
jonah
likes
to
give
up
his
bed
i
do
what
i
can
i
said
taking
a
cigarette
from
the
box
by
her
side
oh
and
do
ask
if
it
true
about
evelyn
right
oh
i
tell
you
as
i
come
back
i
forbid
you
murmured
her
husband
to
this
room
i
kissed
my
sister
lobbed
a
novel
on
to
my
back
and
withdrew
before
he
had
time
to
retaliate
then
i
stepped
barefoot
downstairs
to
perform
my
mission
with
the
collapse
of
the
excitement
nobby
suspicion
shrank
into
curiosity
his
muscles
relaxed
and
he
stopped
quivering
so
infectious
a
thing
is
perturbation
the
door
of
the
library
was
ajar
and
the
thin
strip
of
light
which
issued
was
enough
to
guide
me
across
the
hall
the
parquet
was
cold
to
the
touch
and
i
began
to
regret
that
i
had
not
returned
for
my
slippers
as
i
pushed
the
door
open
i
say
jonah
i
said
that
fool
berry
it
was
with
something
of
a
shock
that
i
found
myself
looking
directly
along
the
barrel
of
a
automatic
pistol
which
a
stout
gentleman
wearing
a
green
mask
white
kid
gloves
and
immaculate
was
pointing
immediately
at
my
nose
there
now
he
purred
i
was
going
to
say
up
just
like
that
up
it
so
romantic
but
i
had
expected
the
dog
suppose
you
put
your
right
hand
up
i
shook
my
head
i
want
that
for
my
cigarette
i
said
for
a
moment
we
stood
looking
at
one
another
then
my
fat
began
to
shake
with
laughter
you
know
he
gurgled
this
is
most
irregular
it
enough
to
make
jack
sheppard
turn
in
his
grave
it
is
really
however
as
an
inveterate
smoker
i
feel
for
you
so
we
have
a
compromise
he
nodded
towards
an
armchair
which
stood
by
the
window
you
go
and
sit
down
in
that
extremely
comfortable
armchair
sit
well
back
and
we
say
any
more
about
the
hands
as
he
spoke
he
stepped
forward
nobby
received
him
with
a
venomous
growl
and
to
my
amazement
the
fellow
immediately
caressed
him
dogs
always
take
to
me
he
added
i
sure
i
do
know
why
but
a
great
help
to
my
mortification
the
sealyham
proved
to
be
no
exception
to
the
rule
i
could
feel
his
tail
going
as
in
a
dream
i
crossed
to
the
chair
and
sat
down
as
i
moved
the
pistol
moved
also
i
hate
pointing
this
thing
at
you
said
the
late
speaker
it
so
suggestive
if
you
care
to
give
me
your
word
you
know
between
gentlemen
i
make
no
promises
i
snapped
the
other
sighed
perhaps
you
right
he
said
lean
well
back
please
better
the
consummate
impudence
of
the
rogue
intensified
the
atmosphere
of
unreality
which
was
most
distracting
doggedly
my
bewildered
brain
was
labouring
in
the
midst
of
a
litter
of
fiction
which
had
suddenly
changed
into
truth
the
impossible
had
come
to
pass
the
cracksman
of
the
novel
had
come
to
life
and
i
was
reluctantly
witnessing
in
comparative
comfort
and
at
my
own
expense
an
actual
exhibition
of
felony
enriched
with
all
the
spices
which
the
cupboard
of
sensation
contains
the
monstrous
audacity
of
the
proceedings
and
the
way
in
which
they
were
conducted
were
almost
stupefying
most
of
the
silver
in
the
house
including
a
number
of
pieces
our
possession
of
which
i
had
completely
forgotten
seemed
to
have
been
collected
and
laid
in
rough
order
upon
rugs
which
had
been
piled
one
upon
the
other
to
deaden
noise
one
man
was
taking
it
up
piece
by
piece
scrutinizing
it
with
an
such
as
watchmakers
use
and
dictating
descriptions
and
particulars
to
a
second
who
was
seated
at
the
broad
entering
the
details
in
triplicate
in
a
large
by
his
side
a
third
manipulated
a
pair
of
scales
weighing
each
piece
with
the
greatest
care
and
reporting
the
result
to
the
second
who
added
the
weight
to
the
description
occasionally
the
latter
paused
to
draw
at
a
cigarette
which
lay
smouldering
in
the
by
his
side
as
each
piece
was
weighed
the
third
handed
it
to
a
fourth
assistant
who
wrapped
it
in
a
bag
of
green
baize
and
laid
it
gently
in
an
open
four
other
cases
stood
by
his
side
all
bearing
a
number
of
labels
and
more
or
less
the
worse
for
wear
all
four
men
were
masked
and
gloved
and
working
with
a
rapidity
and
method
which
were
remarkable
with
the
exception
of
the
packer
who
wore
a
footman
livery
they
were
attired
in
we
find
it
easier
said
the
master
as
if
interpreting
my
thoughts
to
do
it
all
on
the
spot
then
it
over
and
done
with
i
do
hope
you
insured
he
added
i
always
think
it
so
much
more
satisfactory
up
to
the
hilt
said
i
cheerfully
we
had
it
all
only
this
year
because
of
the
rise
in
silver
splendid
enthusiastically
but
i
neglecting
you
with
his
left
hand
the
rogue
picked
up
an
and
stepped
to
my
side
then
he
backed
to
the
mantelpiece
whence
he
picked
up
and
brought
me
a
handful
of
cigarettes
laying
them
on
the
broad
arm
of
my
chair
i
afraid
the
box
has
gone
he
said
regretfully
may
i
mix
you
a
drink
i
shook
my
head
i
had
my
ration
if
i
known
i
have
saved
some
you
see
i
sit
up
so
late
as
a
rule
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
did
so
my
own
last
words
rang
familiarly
in
my
ears
i
do
sit
up
so
late
do
sit
up
jonah
he
and
harry
were
due
to
arrive
any
moment
hope
leaped
up
within
me
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
i
glanced
at
the
silver
still
lying
upon
the
rugs
slowly
it
was
diminishing
and
the
services
of
a
second
would
soon
be
necessary
i
calculated
that
to
complete
the
bestowal
would
take
the
best
part
of
an
hour
and
began
to
speculate
upon
the
course
events
would
take
when
the
travellers
appeared
i
began
to
pray
fervently
that
harry
would
be
unable
to
get
in
at
the
club
now
then
you
three
said
a
reproving
voice
i
surprised
at
you
daphne
the
rogues
were
trained
to
a
hair
before
she
was
framed
in
the
doorway
the
cold
steel
of
another
weapon
was
pressing
against
my
throat
and
the
master
was
bowing
in
her
direction
madam
i
beg
that
you
will
neither
move
nor
cry
out
my
sister
stood
like
a
statue
only
the
rise
and
fall
of
her
bosom
showed
that
she
was
alive
pale
as
death
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
speaker
who
was
holding
his
right
hand
markedly
behind
him
her
unbound
hair
streaming
over
her
shoulders
she
made
a
beautiful
and
arresting
picture
a
kimono
of
softest
apricot
over
which
sprawled
vivid
embroideries
here
in
the
guise
of
dragons
there
in
that
of
a
wanton
butterfly
swathed
her
from
throat
to
foot
from
the
mouths
of
its
gaping
sleeves
her
shapely
wrists
and
hands
thrust
out
and
still
as
sculpture
for
a
moment
all
eyes
were
upon
her
as
she
stood
motionless
then
the
man
with
the
screwed
it
back
into
his
eye
and
resumed
his
dictation
the
spell
was
broken
the
packer
left
his
work
and
lifting
a
great
chair
bodily
with
apparent
ease
set
it
noiselessly
by
my
side
the
master
bowed
again
i
congratulate
you
madam
upon
your
great
heart
i
beg
that
you
will
join
that
gentleman
with
a
high
head
my
lady
disdain
swept
to
the
spot
indicated
and
sank
into
the
chair
please
lean
right
back
thank
you
the
cold
steel
was
withdrawn
from
my
throat
and
i
breathed
more
freely
nobby
wriggled
to
get
to
my
sister
but
i
held
him
fast
so
it
was
burglars
said
daphne
looks
like
it
said
i
glanced
at
the
leader
who
had
taken
his
seat
upon
the
his
right
hand
appeared
to
be
resting
upon
his
knee
i
think
said
my
sister
i
have
a
cigarette
i
handed
her
one
from
the
pile
and
lighted
it
from
my
own
as
i
did
so
i
whispered
ne
tardera
i
beg
said
the
spokesman
that
you
will
not
whisper
together
it
tends
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
mistrust
my
sister
inclined
her
head
with
a
silvery
laugh
you
have
a
large
staff
she
said
that
is
my
way
i
am
not
a
believer
in
the
lone
hand
but
there
you
are
homines
tot
sententicæ
and
with
that
he
spread
out
his
hands
and
shrugged
his
broad
shoulders
daphne
raised
her
delicate
eyebrows
and
blew
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
fewer
men
she
quoted
greater
share
of
the
shoulders
began
to
shake
was
the
reply
a
pretty
thrust
madam
but
you
must
read
further
on
gentlemen
in
now
abed
shall
think
themselves
accursed
they
were
not
here
shall
we
say
that
er
honours
are
easy
and
the
old
villain
fairly
rocked
with
merriment
daphne
laughed
airily
good
for
you
she
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
sitting
here
several
things
look
extremely
easy
so
on
the
whole
they
are
mind
you
see
the
easy
side
and
you
madam
are
a
very
privileged
spectator
i
have
paid
for
my
seat
flashed
my
sister
royally
still
deadhead
or
not
a
spectator
you
are
and
as
such
you
see
the
easy
side
now
one
of
the
greatest
dangers
that
can
befall
a
thief
is
avarice
i
suppose
you
doing
this
out
of
charity
i
blurted
listen
many
a
promising
career
of
er
appropriation
has
come
to
an
abrupt
and
sordid
end
and
all
because
success
but
whetted
where
it
should
have
satisfied
he
addressed
my
sister
happily
for
you
you
do
not
sleep
in
your
pearls
otherwise
since
you
are
here
i
might
have
fallen
who
knows
as
it
is
pearls
diamonds
and
the
emerald
bracelets
that
came
from
prague
you
see
madam
i
know
them
all
will
lie
upstairs
untouched
i
came
for
silver
and
i
shall
take
nothing
else
some
day
perhaps
the
quiet
of
his
voice
faded
and
only
the
murmur
of
the
ceaseless
dictation
remained
then
that
too
faltered
and
died
for
a
second
master
and
men
stood
motionless
then
the
former
pointed
to
daphne
and
me
and
numbers
three
and
four
whipped
to
our
side
somebody
whistling
softly
was
descending
the
stairs
just
as
it
became
recognizable
the
air
slid
out
of
a
whistle
into
a
song
and
my
unwitting
invested
the
last
two
lines
with
all
the
mockery
of
pathos
of
which
his
inferior
baritone
voice
was
capable
i
for
ever
in
the
air
he
entered
upon
the
last
word
started
ever
so
slightly
at
his
reception
and
then
stood
extremely
still
bubbles
be
blowed
he
said
what
shall
i
moisten
the
lips
or
would
you
rather
i
wore
a
sickly
smile
i
should
like
it
to
be
a
good
photograph
you
know
you
ca
touch
me
reggibald
i
in
balk
his
eyes
wandered
round
the
room
why
there
nobby
and
the
game
musical
chairs
i
know
a
better
one
than
that
his
eyes
returned
to
the
master
now
do
you
look
and
i
hide
in
the
hassock
then
when
i
say
you
put
down
the
musket
and
wish
then
excuse
me
calmly
he
twitched
a
paisley
shawl
from
the
back
of
the
sofa
and
crossed
to
his
wife
tenderly
he
wrapped
it
about
her
feet
and
knees
by
the
time
he
had
finished
a
third
chair
was
awaiting
him
and
numbers
three
and
four
had
returned
to
their
work
pray
sit
down
drawled
the
master
and
lean
well
back
right
you
know
i
awfully
sorry
you
left
your
bed
do
mention
it
said
berry
i
would
have
missed
this
for
any
thing
how
dartmoor
looking
the
fat
rogue
sighed
i
have
not
had
a
holiday
he
said
for
nearly
two
years
and
night
work
tells
you
know
of
course
i
rest
during
the
day
but
it
is
the
same
how
wicked
and
they
call
this
a
free
country
i
should
see
your
about
it
or
was
he
up
when
you
called
the
other
shook
his
head
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
said
he
was
out
of
town
george
give
the
gentleman
a
match
the
packer
picked
up
a
and
set
it
by
berry
side
i
so
sorry
about
the
chocolates
you
see
i
expecting
hullo
at
the
mention
of
the
magical
word
nobby
had
leapt
from
my
unready
grasp
and
trotted
across
to
the
fireplace
there
to
my
disgust
and
vexation
he
fixed
the
master
with
an
expectant
stare
and
then
sat
up
upon
his
hindquarters
and
begged
a
sweatmeat
his
favourer
began
to
heave
with
merriment
what
an
engaging
scrap
he
wheezed
taking
a
chocolate
from
an
occasional
table
upon
which
the
contents
of
a
dessert
dish
had
apparently
been
emptied
here
my
little
apostate
well
caught
with
an
irrational
rapidity
the
sealyham
disposed
of
the
first
comfit
he
had
been
given
for
more
than
six
months
then
he
resumed
the
attractive
posture
which
he
had
found
so
profitable
lazily
his
patron
continued
to
respond
resentfully
i
watched
the
procedure
endeavouring
to
console
myself
with
the
reflection
that
in
a
few
hours
nature
would
assuredly
administer
to
the
backslider
a
more
terrible
and
appropriate
correction
than
any
that
i
could
devise
would
jonah
never
come
i
stole
a
glance
at
the
clock
five
and
twenty
minutes
to
two
and
when
he
did
come
what
then
were
he
and
harry
to
blunder
into
the
slough
as
we
had
done
impossible
there
was
probably
a
man
outside
possibly
a
car
which
would
set
them
thinking
then
even
if
the
brutes
got
away
their
game
would
be
spoiled
it
would
be
such
a
humiliating
oh
why
had
daphne
come
down
her
presence
put
any
attempt
at
action
out
of
the
question
and
why
a
taxi
slowed
for
a
distant
corner
and
turned
into
the
street
for
a
moment
it
seemed
to
falter
then
its
speed
was
changed
clumsily
and
it
began
to
grind
its
way
in
our
direction
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
again
the
speed
was
changed
and
the
rising
snarl
choked
to
give
way
to
a
metallic
murmur
which
was
rapidly
approaching
i
could
hardly
breathe
then
the
noise
swelled
up
hung
for
an
instant
upon
the
very
crest
of
earshot
only
to
sink
abruptly
as
the
cab
swept
past
taking
our
hopes
with
it
of
the
silver
had
disappeared
berry
cleared
his
throat
you
know
he
said
this
is
an
education
in
my
innocence
i
thought
that
a
burglar
shoved
his
swag
in
a
sack
and
then
pushed
off
and
did
the
rest
in
the
back
parlour
of
a
in
notting
dale
as
it
is
my
only
wonder
is
that
you
did
bring
a
brazier
and
a
couple
of
not
my
job
was
the
reply
i
not
a
receiver
besides
you
think
that
all
this
beautiful
silver
is
to
be
broken
up
the
horror
of
his
uplifted
hands
would
have
been
more
convincing
if
both
of
them
had
been
empty
why
in
a
very
little
while
particularly
if
you
travel
you
will
have
every
opportunity
of
buying
it
back
again
in
open
market
but
how
comic
said
berry
i
should
think
you
a
favourite
at
lloyd
mind
if
i
blow
my
nose
or
would
that
be
a
not
at
all
urbanely
indeed
if
you
would
care
to
give
me
your
word
berry
shook
his
head
honour
among
thieves
he
said
unfortunately
i
honest
so
you
must
have
no
truck
with
me
never
mind
touch
cards
at
all
or
only
at
epsom
beneath
the
green
mask
the
mouth
tightened
and
i
could
see
that
the
taunt
had
gone
home
no
man
likes
to
be
whipped
before
his
underlings
nobby
profited
by
the
master
silence
and
had
devoured
two
more
chocolates
before
berry
spoke
again
this
time
to
me
gentleman
seems
annoyed
he
remarked
i
do
hope
he
misconstrued
anything
i
said
think
we
ought
to
offer
him
breakfast
of
course
five
is
rather
a
lot
but
i
dare
say
one
of
them
is
a
vegetarian
and
you
can
pretend
you
do
care
for
haddock
or
they
may
have
some
tripe
downstairs
you
never
know
and
afterwards
we
could
run
them
back
to
limehouse
by
the
way
i
wonder
if
i
ought
to
tell
him
about
the
silver
it
only
nickel
but
i
do
want
to
keep
anything
back
oh
and
what
about
the
dividend
warrant
of
course
it
wants
riveting
and
er
forging
and
i
do
think
they
recognize
it
but
he
could
try
if
i
die
before
he
goes
ask
him
to
leave
his
address
then
if
he
leaves
anything
behind
the
butler
can
send
it
on
i
remember
i
left
a
pair
of
once
at
chatsworth
the
duke
never
sent
them
on
but
then
they
were
perishable
besides
one
of
them
followed
me
as
far
as
leicester
instinct
you
know
i
wrote
to
about
it
he
paused
to
shift
uneasily
in
his
seat
you
know
if
i
have
to
sustain
this
pose
much
longer
i
shall
get
railway
spine
or
a
hare
lip
or
something
hush
said
i
what
did
alfred
austin
say
in
i
know
said
berry
leave
me
here
a
little
while
as
yet
early
morn
precisely
but
then
all
his
best
work
was
admittedly
done
under
the
eiderdown
the
clock
upon
the
wall
was
chiming
the
hour
two
would
jonah
never
come
i
fancy
the
same
query
renewed
its
hammering
at
berry
brain
for
after
a
moment
reflection
he
turned
to
the
master
i
do
wish
to
presume
upon
your
courtesy
he
said
but
will
the
executive
portion
of
your
night
work
finish
when
that
remaining
treasure
has
been
bestowed
so
far
as
you
are
concerned
oh
another
appointment
of
course
this
time
stunt
gives
you
another
hour
does
it
well
i
must
wish
you
a
warmer
welcome
that
were
impossible
was
the
bland
reply
once
or
twice
i
must
confess
i
thought
you
a
little
er
equivocal
but
let
that
pass
i
only
regret
that
pleydell
particularly
should
have
been
so
much
inconvenienced
do
mention
it
said
berry
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
all
very
pleased
to
have
met
you
you
have
interested
us
more
than
i
can
say
with
true
chivalry
you
have
abstained
from
murder
and
mutilation
and
you
have
suffered
me
to
blow
my
nose
when
a
less
courteous
visitor
would
have
obliged
me
to
sniff
with
desperate
and
painful
regularity
for
nearly
half
an
hour
can
generosity
go
further
the
rogue
upon
the
began
to
shake
with
laughter
again
you
a
good
loser
he
crowed
i
give
you
that
i
quite
glad
you
came
down
most
of
my
hosts
i
never
see
and
that
dull
you
know
dull
and
those
i
do
are
so
often
er
unsympathetic
yes
i
shall
remember
going
to
change
his
rings
murmured
berry
and
now
the
highly
delicate
question
of
our
departure
is
i
am
afraid
imminent
to
avoid
exciting
impertinent
curiosity
you
will
appreciate
that
we
must
take
our
leave
as
artlessly
as
possible
and
that
the
order
of
our
going
must
be
characterized
by
no
unusual
circumstance
such
for
instance
as
a
hue
and
cry
anything
so
vulgar
as
a
scene
must
at
all
costs
be
obviated
excuse
me
blake
confederate
number
one
stepped
noiselessly
to
his
side
and
listened
in
silence
to
certain
instructions
which
were
to
us
inaudible
i
looked
about
me
the
last
of
the
silver
had
disappeared
the
packer
was
dismantling
the
scales
as
a
preliminary
to
laying
them
in
the
last
the
clerk
was
fastening
together
the
sheets
which
he
had
detached
from
the
flimsy
number
three
had
taken
a
light
overcoat
from
a
chair
and
was
putting
it
on
and
the
time
was
six
minutes
past
two
and
what
of
jonah
he
and
harry
would
probably
arrive
about
five
minutes
too
late
i
bit
my
lip
savagely
again
the
chief
malefactor
lifted
up
his
voice
it
is
my
experience
he
drawled
that
temerity
is
born
if
not
of
curiosity
then
of
ignorance
now
if
there
is
one
vice
more
than
another
which
i
deplore
it
is
temerity
especially
when
it
is
displayed
by
a
host
at
two
of
a
morning
i
am
therefore
going
to
the
root
of
the
matter
in
short
i
propose
to
satisfy
your
very
natural
curiosity
regarding
our
method
of
departure
and
incidentally
to
show
you
exactly
what
you
are
up
against
you
see
i
believe
in
prevention
his
utterance
of
the
last
sentences
was
more
silky
than
ever
the
constables
who
have
passed
this
house
since
twelve
will
if
reasonably
observant
have
noticed
the
carpet
which
upon
entering
we
laid
upon
the
steps
a
departure
of
guests
therefore
even
at
this
advanced
hour
should
arouse
no
more
suspicion
than
the
which
has
now
been
waiting
for
some
nine
minutes
the
lights
in
the
hall
will
now
be
turned
on
the
front
door
will
be
opened
wide
and
the
footman
will
place
the
in
the
car
at
the
open
door
of
which
he
will
stand
while
my
colleagues
and
i
i
need
hardly
say
by
this
time
unmasked
emerge
at
our
leisure
chatting
in
a
most
ordinary
way
i
shall
be
the
last
to
enter
the
car
i
beg
your
pardon
i
shall
be
the
last
but
one
for
an
instant
he
halted
as
if
to
emphasize
the
correction
and
my
entry
will
coincide
with
what
is
a
favourable
opportunity
for
the
footman
to
assume
the
cap
and
overcoat
which
he
must
of
necessity
wear
if
his
closing
of
the
front
door
and
subsequent
occupation
of
the
seat
by
the
chauffeur
are
to
excite
no
remark
you
see
i
try
to
think
of
everything
he
paused
for
a
moment
regarding
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
though
they
were
ungloved
then
your
presence
here
presents
no
difficulty
major
and
pleydell
will
stay
in
this
room
silent
and
motionless
and
detaining
the
dog
you
nonchalantly
he
pointed
an
extremely
ugly
in
my
direction
will
vouch
with
your
er
health
for
their
observance
of
these
conditions
be
good
enough
to
stand
up
and
place
your
hands
behind
you
with
a
glance
at
berry
i
rose
all
things
considered
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
the
man
whom
he
had
addressed
as
blake
picked
up
nobby
and
crossing
the
room
laid
the
terrier
in
berry
arms
then
he
lashed
my
wrists
together
with
the
rapidity
of
an
expert
understand
i
take
no
chances
a
harsh
note
had
crept
into
the
even
tones
the
slightest
indiscretion
will
cost
this
gentleman
extremely
dear
i
began
to
hope
very
much
that
my
would
appreciate
the
advisability
of
doing
as
he
had
been
told
george
my
coat
the
voice
was
as
suave
as
ever
again
thank
you
is
everything
ready
berry
stifled
a
yawn
you
do
mean
to
say
he
exclaimed
that
you
actually
going
dear
me
well
well
i
do
suppose
you
a
card
on
you
no
sorry
i
should
have
liked
to
remember
you
in
my
prayers
never
mind
and
you
do
happen
to
know
of
a
good
plain
cook
do
you
no
i
thought
not
well
if
you
should
hear
of
one
carry
on
blake
laid
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
and
urged
me
towards
the
door
as
i
was
going
i
saw
the
master
bow
pleydell
he
said
i
have
the
honour
dear
me
there
that
ridiculous
word
again
never
mind
the
honour
to
bid
to
a
most
brave
lady
with
a
faint
sneer
my
sister
regarded
him
then
revoir
she
said
steadily
so
long
old
bean
said
berry
see
you
at
vine
street
as
i
passed
into
the
hall
the
lights
went
up
and
a
cap
was
clapped
on
to
my
head
and
pulled
down
tight
over
my
eyes
then
i
was
thrust
into
a
corner
of
the
hall
close
to
the
front
door
immediately
this
was
opened
and
i
could
hear
everything
happen
as
we
had
been
led
to
expect
only
there
was
a
hand
on
my
shoulder
i
heard
the
master
coming
with
a
jest
on
his
lips
as
he
passed
me
he
was
speaking
ostensibly
to
one
of
his
comrades
ostensibly
i
should
wait
up
for
jonah
he
said
thanks
to
the
fact
that
one
of
the
assistant
commissioners
of
police
was
an
old
friend
of
mine
we
were
spared
much
of
the
tedious
interrogation
and
but
in
the
circumstances
utterly
futile
attentions
of
the
subordinate
officers
of
the
admission
to
the
house
had
been
gained
without
breaking
and
there
were
no
moreover
since
our
visitors
had
worn
masks
such
descriptions
of
them
as
we
could
give
were
very
inadequate
however
statements
were
taken
from
my
sister
berry
and
myself
and
the
spurious
telegram
was
handed
over
the
insurance
company
was
of
course
informed
of
the
crime
despite
the
paucity
of
detail
our
description
of
the
gang
and
its
methods
aroused
tremendous
excitement
at
scotland
yard
the
master
it
appeared
was
a
veritable
prince
of
darkness
save
that
he
existed
and
was
a
man
of
large
ideas
and
the
utmost
daring
to
whose
charge
half
the
great
unplaced
robberies
of
recent
years
were
rightly
or
wrongly
laid
little
or
nothing
was
known
of
his
manners
or
personality
i
tell
you
said
the
assistant
commissioner
leaning
back
and
tilting
his
chair
he
just
about
as
hot
as
they
make
and
when
we
do
take
him
if
ever
we
do
and
that
might
be
or
in
ten
time
we
might
walk
straight
into
him
next
week
with
the
stuff
in
his
hands
you
never
know
well
when
we
do
take
him
as
like
as
not
prove
to
be
a
popular
or
a
recognized
authority
on
livestock
or
something
you
probably
seen
him
heaps
of
times
in
james
and
as
like
as
not
he
a
member
of
your
own
club
depend
upon
it
the
old
sinner
moves
in
those
circles
which
you
know
are
above
suspicion
if
somebody
pinched
your
watch
at
ascot
you
never
look
for
the
thief
in
the
enclosure
would
you
of
course
not
well
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
do
think
so
meanwhile
let
have
some
lunch
for
my
sister
the
ordeal
had
been
severe
and
for
the
thirty
hours
following
the
robbery
she
had
kept
her
bed
berry
had
contracted
a
slight
cold
and
i
was
not
one
penny
the
worse
jill
was
overcome
to
learn
what
she
had
missed
and
the
reflection
that
she
had
mercifully
slept
upstairs
while
such
a
drama
was
being
enacted
upon
the
ground
floor
rendered
her
inconsolable
jonah
was
summoned
by
telegram
and
came
pelting
from
somerset
to
be
regaled
with
a
picturesque
account
of
the
outrage
the
more
purple
features
of
which
he
at
first
regarded
as
embroidery
and
for
some
time
flatly
refused
to
believe
as
was
to
be
expected
nobby
paid
for
his
treachery
with
an
attack
of
biliousness
the
closing
stages
of
which
were
terrible
to
behold
at
one
time
it
seemed
as
if
no
constitution
could
survive
such
an
upheaval
but
although
the
final
convulsion
left
him
subdued
and
listless
he
was
as
right
as
ever
upon
the
following
morning
the
next
sunday
we
registered
what
was
to
be
our
last
attendance
of
church
parade
for
at
least
three
months
by
common
consent
we
had
that
morning
agreed
altogether
to
eschew
the
subject
of
crime
ever
since
it
had
happened
we
had
discussed
the
great
adventure
so
unceasingly
that
as
berry
had
remarked
at
breakfast
it
was
more
than
likely
that
unless
we
were
to
take
an
immediate
and
firm
line
with
ourselves
we
should
presently
get
grand
larceny
on
the
brain
and
run
into
some
danger
of
qualifying
not
only
for
admission
to
broadmoor
but
for
detention
in
that
institution
till
his
pleasure
should
be
known
for
the
first
hour
or
two
which
followed
our
resolution
we
either
were
silent
or
discussed
other
comparatively
uninteresting
matters
in
a
preoccupied
way
but
gradually
lack
of
ventilation
began
to
tell
and
the
consideration
of
the
robbery
grew
less
absorbent
as
we
entered
the
park
at
stanhope
gate
boy
are
you
glad
adèle
coming
said
jill
i
nodded
abstractedly
rather
you
never
said
so
the
other
night
did
i
i
suppose
if
she
comes
to
southampton
you
go
to
meet
her
may
i
come
with
you
good
heavens
yes
why
should
you
oh
i
do
know
i
thought
perhaps
you
rather
i
whistled
to
nobby
whose
disregard
of
traffic
was
occasionally
conducive
to
heart
failure
as
he
came
cantering
up
adèle
is
my
property
i
said
i
know
but
but
what
i
never
seen
nobby
look
so
clean
said
jill
with
a
daring
irrelevance
that
took
my
breath
away
i
observe
said
i
that
you
are
growing
up
your
adolescence
is
at
hand
you
are
fast
emerging
from
the
chrysalis
of
girlish
innocence
eager
to
show
yourself
a
pert
and
scheming
butterfly
my
cousin
regarded
me
with
feigned
bewilderment
yes
you
got
the
baby
stare
all
right
but
you
must
learn
to
control
that
little
red
mouth
watch
daphne
jill
made
no
further
endeavour
to
restrain
the
guilty
laughter
which
was
trembling
upon
her
lips
i
you
just
love
her
she
bubbled
i
thought
very
rapidly
then
i
think
we
all
do
said
i
she
very
attractive
i
mean
it
said
jill
so
do
i
look
at
her
ears
oh
i
forgot
hides
them
under
her
hair
does
she
her
eyes
then
i
observe
said
jill
pompously
that
you
are
sitting
up
and
taking
notice
your
adol
adol
er
what
you
said
is
at
hand
you
are
emerging
from
the
chrysalis
of
ignorance
this
is
blasphemy
you
wicked
girl
and
what
are
you
getting
at
matchmaking
or
only
blackmail
well
it
time
you
got
married
is
it
i
do
want
you
to
dear
but
i
know
you
got
to
soon
and
and
i
like
you
to
be
happy
there
was
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
and
i
looked
down
to
see
her
eyes
shining
little
jill
i
said
if
i
marry
six
wives
i
shall
still
be
in
love
with
my
cousin
a
little
fair
girl
with
great
grey
eyes
and
the
prettiest
ways
and
a
heart
of
the
purest
gold
and
now
shall
we
cry
here
or
by
the
serpentine
she
caught
at
my
arm
laughing
boy
you
very
oh
i
say
where
nobby
we
had
reached
the
achilles
statue
and
a
hurried
retrospect
showed
me
the
terrier
some
thirty
paces
away
exchanging
discourtesies
with
an
aberdeen
the
two
were
walking
round
each
other
with
a
terrible
deliberation
and
from
their
respective
demeanours
it
was
transparently
clear
that
only
an
immediate
distraction
could
avert
the
scandal
of
a
distressing
brawl
regardless
of
my
surroundings
i
summoned
the
sealyham
in
my
parade
voice
to
my
relief
he
started
and
after
a
menacing
look
at
his
opponent
presumably
intended
to
discourage
an
attack
in
rear
cautiously
withdrew
from
his
presence
and
once
out
of
range
came
scampering
in
our
direction
my
and
daphne
whom
we
had
outdistanced
arrived
at
the
same
time
as
i
was
reproving
the
terrier
the
very
people
said
a
familiar
voice
it
was
the
assistant
commissioner
labouring
under
excitement
which
he
with
difficulty
suppressed
he
had
been
hurrying
and
was
out
of
breath
i
want
you
to
cross
the
road
and
walk
along
by
the
side
of
the
row
he
said
jerkily
if
you
see
anyone
you
recognize
take
off
your
hat
and
pleydell
you
lower
your
parasol
but
my
dear
chap
said
berry
they
were
all
masked
well
if
you
recognize
a
voice
or
even
a
voice
my
dear
fellow
we
in
the
open
air
besides
what
jury
for
heaven
sake
cried
the
other
do
as
i
ask
i
i
know
it
a
chance
in
a
million
think
me
mad
call
me
a
fool
anything
you
like
but
go
his
earnestness
was
irresistible
i
whistled
to
nobby
who
had
seized
the
opportunity
of
straying
apparently
by
accident
towards
a
and
started
to
stroll
in
the
direction
of
the
row
jill
walked
beside
me
twittering
and
a
glance
over
my
shoulder
showed
me
my
sister
and
berry
a
horse
length
behind
behind
them
again
came
the
assistant
commissioner
we
crossed
the
road
and
entered
the
walk
he
had
mentioned
it
was
a
beautiful
day
the
great
sun
flamed
out
of
a
perfect
sky
and
there
was
little
or
no
wind
with
the
exception
of
a
and
two
little
girls
the
row
was
empty
but
the
walk
was
as
crowded
as
a
comfortably
filled
if
you
except
the
dancers
who
are
sitting
out
for
while
three
could
walk
abreast
with
small
inconvenience
either
to
others
or
themselves
there
was
hardly
a
seat
to
spare
i
have
seen
smarter
parades
it
was
clear
that
many
had
already
left
town
and
that
a
number
of
visitors
had
already
arrived
but
there
was
apparent
the
same
quiet
air
of
gaiety
the
same
good
humour
which
fine
feathers
bring
and
truth
to
tell
less
and
more
undisguised
enjoyment
than
i
can
ever
remember
idly
i
talked
with
jill
not
thinking
what
i
said
nor
noticing
what
she
answered
but
my
heart
was
pounding
against
my
ribs
and
i
was
glancing
incessantly
from
side
to
side
in
a
fever
of
fear
lest
i
should
miss
the
obvious
now
and
again
i
threw
a
look
over
my
shoulder
always
berry
and
daphne
were
close
behind
fervently
i
wished
that
they
were
in
front
i
began
to
walk
more
slowly
suddenly
i
realized
that
i
was
streaming
with
sweat
as
i
felt
for
my
handkerchief
look
at
nobby
said
jill
whatever
he
doing
i
glanced
at
my
cousin
to
follow
the
direction
of
her
eyes
was
sitting
up
begging
before
a
large
elderly
gentleman
who
was
seated
immaculately
dressed
some
six
paces
away
he
was
affecting
not
to
see
the
terrier
but
there
was
a
queer
frozen
look
about
his
broad
smile
that
set
me
staring
even
as
i
gazed
he
lowered
his
eyes
and
lifting
a
hand
from
his
knee
began
to
regard
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
though
they
were
ungloved
for
a
second
i
stood
spellbound
then
i
took
off
my
hat
chapter
ix
how
adèle
feste
arrived
and
dunklesbaum
supped
with
the
devil
there
she
is
cried
jill
where
said
i
screwing
up
my
eyes
and
peering
eagerly
at
the
crowded
taffrails
there
boy
there
look
she
seen
us
she
waving
hardly
i
followed
the
direction
of
my
cousin
pink
index
finger
which
was
stretched
quivering
towards
the
promenade
deck
is
that
her
in
blue
but
a
smiling
jill
was
already
nodding
and
waving
unmistakably
to
the
tall
slim
figure
advances
which
the
latter
was
as
surely
returning
with
a
cheerly
wave
of
her
slight
blue
arm
somewhat
sheepishly
i
took
off
my
hat
adèle
feste
had
arrived
more
than
fifteen
months
had
elapsed
since
we
had
reluctantly
seen
her
into
the
at
euston
and
wished
her
a
safe
journey
to
her
american
home
at
the
time
with
an
uneasiness
bred
of
experience
i
had
wondered
whether
our
friendship
was
to
survive
the
battery
of
time
and
distance
or
whether
it
was
destined
to
slip
into
a
decline
and
so
presently
out
of
our
lives
fainting
and
painless
touch
however
had
been
maintained
by
a
fitful
correspondence
and
constant
references
to
miss
feste
promised
visit
to
white
ladies
a
consummation
which
we
one
and
all
desired
were
made
for
what
they
were
worth
finally
my
sister
sat
down
and
issued
a
desperate
summons
my
dear
do
keep
us
waiting
any
longer
arrive
in
august
and
stay
for
six
months
if
you
do
we
shall
begin
to
believe
what
we
already
suspect
that
we
live
too
far
away
the
thrust
went
home
within
a
month
the
invitation
had
been
accepted
with
the
direct
result
that
here
were
jill
and
i
at
six
of
a
pleasant
august
evening
standing
upon
a
quay
at
southampton
while
the
rolls
waited
patiently
with
fitch
at
her
wheel
a
stone
throw
away
ready
to
rush
our
guest
and
ourselves
over
the
odd
fifteen
miles
that
lay
between
the
port
and
white
ladies
with
us
in
the
car
we
could
take
the
inevitable
cabin
trunk
and
adèle
heavy
baggage
was
to
be
consigned
to
the
care
of
fitch
who
would
bring
it
by
rail
the
same
evening
to
mockery
dale
the
little
wayside
station
which
served
five
villages
and
our
own
among
them
nobody
from
the
quay
was
allowed
to
board
the
liner
and
none
of
the
passengers
were
allowed
to
disembark
until
the
baggage
had
been
for
the
best
part
therefore
of
an
hour
and
a
half
jill
and
i
hovered
under
the
shadow
of
the
tall
ship
walking
up
and
down
or
standing
looking
up
at
the
promenade
deck
with
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
an
impotently
fatuous
air
and
occasionally
the
meretricious
leer
usually
reserved
for
the
photographer
studio
at
last
if
they
do
let
them
off
soon
i
announced
i
shall
break
down
the
strain
of
being
cordial
with
somebody
who
in
sight
but
out
of
earshot
is
becoming
unbearable
let
go
and
have
a
breather
behind
the
hutment
and
i
indicated
an
erection
which
looked
like
a
that
had
been
thrown
together
during
the
crimean
war
but
jill
was
inexorable
it
ca
be
long
now
she
argued
and
if
we
go
away
there
she
seized
my
arm
with
a
triumphant
clutch
look
they
beginning
to
get
off
it
was
true
one
by
one
the
vanguard
of
passengers
was
already
straggling
laden
on
to
the
high
gangway
i
strained
my
eyes
for
a
glimpse
of
the
slight
blue
figure
which
had
left
the
taffrail
and
was
presumably
imprisoned
in
the
press
which
could
be
observed
welling
out
of
a
doorway
upon
the
main
deck
a
sudden
and
violent
stress
upon
my
left
hand
at
once
reminded
me
of
nobby
existence
and
suggested
that
of
a
cat
mechanically
i
held
fast
to
the
lead
at
the
opposite
end
of
which
the
sealyham
was
choking
and
labouring
in
a
frenzied
endeavour
to
molest
a
sleek
tabby
which
from
the
assurance
of
its
gait
appeared
to
be
a
upon
the
quay
the
attempted
felony
attracted
considerable
attention
which
should
have
been
otherwise
directed
with
the
result
that
a
clergyman
and
two
ladies
were
within
an
ace
of
being
overrun
by
an
enormous
truckload
of
swaying
baggage
and
coarsely
reviled
by
a
sweating
hercules
for
their
pains
as
it
was
the
sudden
diversion
of
the
trolley
projected
several
pieces
of
luggage
on
to
the
quay
occasioning
an
embryo
stampede
of
the
bystanders
and
drawing
down
a
stern
rebuke
delivered
in
no
measured
terms
from
a
official
who
had
not
seen
what
had
happened
upon
the
heads
of
innocent
and
guilty
alike
the
real
offender
met
my
accusing
frown
with
the
disarming
smile
of
childish
innocence
and
when
i
shook
my
head
wagged
his
tail
unctuously
as
i
picked
him
up
and
put
him
under
my
arm
so
this
is
nobby
said
adèle
i
uncovered
and
nodded
and
he
had
a
bath
this
morning
so
as
to
be
all
nice
and
clean
when
miss
feste
arrived
i
did
too
how
reckless
said
adèle
you
look
very
well
on
it
thank
you
said
i
shaking
hands
and
you
look
glorious
hullo
you
let
your
hair
grow
i
am
glad
think
it
an
improvement
if
possible
the
eyebrows
went
up
the
bright
brown
eyes
regarded
me
quizzically
the
faint
familiar
smile
hung
maddeningly
on
the
red
lips
polite
as
ever
she
flashed
put
it
down
to
the
bath
said
i
cleanliness
is
next
to
er
devotion
yes
and
he
been
counting
the
days
broke
in
jill
he
has
really
of
course
we
all
have
but
oh
adèle
i
so
glad
you
come
adèle
drew
my
cousin
arm
within
her
own
so
i
she
said
quietly
and
now
i
did
have
a
once
and
a
think
it
any
good
looking
for
them
twenty
minutes
later
we
were
all
three
four
with
nobby
on
the
front
seat
of
the
rolls
which
was
nosing
its
way
gingerly
out
of
the
town
i
wonder
if
you
realize
said
adèle
what
a
beautiful
country
you
live
in
at
the
moment
we
were
immediately
between
an
unpleasantly
crowded
tram
and
a
beerhouse
do
you
have
trams
said
i
or
does
alcohol
mean
so
much
to
you
i
suppose
prohibition
is
a
bit
of
a
jar
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
was
thinking
of
the
isle
of
wight
it
looked
so
exquisite
as
we
were
coming
in
just
like
a
toy
continent
out
of
a
giant
nursery
before
the
day
is
out
i
prophesied
you
shall
see
finer
things
than
that
once
clear
of
the
streets
i
gave
the
car
her
head
for
a
while
we
slid
past
ground
verdant
and
fresh
and
blowing
but
flat
and
sparsely
timbered
with
coppices
here
and
there
and
sometimes
elms
in
the
hedgerows
and
now
and
again
a
parcel
of
youngster
oaks
about
a
green
fair
country
enough
at
any
time
and
at
this
summer
sundown
homely
and
radiant
but
there
was
better
to
come
the
car
fled
on
soon
the
ground
rose
sharply
by
leaps
and
bounds
the
yellow
road
swerving
to
right
and
left
deep
tilted
meadows
on
one
side
with
a
screen
of
birches
beyond
and
on
the
other
a
sloping
rabble
of
timber
whose
foliage
made
up
a
tattered
motley
humble
and
odd
and
bastard
yet
with
it
all
so
rich
in
tender
tones
and
unexpected
feats
of
drapery
that
adèle
cried
that
it
was
a
slice
of
fairyland
and
sat
with
her
chin
on
her
shoulder
till
the
road
curled
up
into
the
depths
of
a
broad
through
which
it
cut
thin
and
dead
straight
and
cool
and
strangely
solemn
in
a
flash
it
had
become
the
nave
of
a
cathedral
immense
solitary
sombre
and
straight
and
tall
the
walls
rose
up
to
where
the
swaying
roof
sobered
the
mellow
sunshine
and
only
let
it
pass
dim
and
so
sacred
the
wanton
breeze
caught
in
the
maze
of
tufted
pinnacles
filtered
its
chastened
way
a
pensive
organist
learned
to
draw
grave
litanies
from
the
boughs
and
reverently
voice
the
air
of
sanctity
the
fresh
familiar
scent
hung
for
a
smokeless
incense
breathing
high
ritual
and
redolent
of
pious
mystery
no
circumstance
of
worship
was
unobserved
with
one
consent
birds
beasts
and
insects
made
not
a
sound
the
precious
pall
of
silence
lay
like
a
phantom
cloud
unruffled
nature
was
on
her
knees
the
car
fled
on
out
of
the
priestless
sanctuary
up
over
the
crest
of
the
rise
into
the
kiss
of
the
sunlight
we
sailed
and
so
on
to
a
moor
all
splashed
and
dappled
with
the
brilliant
yellow
of
the
gorse
in
bloom
and
rolling
away
into
the
hazy
distance
like
an
untroubled
sea
so
for
a
mile
it
flowed
a
lazy
pomp
of
purple
and
glowing
then
came
soft
cliffs
of
swelling
woodland
rising
to
stay
its
course
with
gentle
dignity
walls
that
uplifted
eyes
found
but
the
dwindled
edge
of
a
far
mightier
flood
that
stretched
and
tossed
a
leafy
waste
of
billows
flaunting
more
living
shades
of
green
than
painters
dream
of
laced
here
and
there
with
gold
and
once
in
a
long
while
shot
with
crimson
rising
and
falling
with
atlantic
grandeur
till
the
eye
faltered
and
the
proud
rich
waves
seemed
to
be
breaking
on
the
rosy
sky
and
over
all
the
sun
lay
dying
his
crimson
ebb
of
life
staining
the
firmament
with
splendour
his
mighty
heart
turning
the
dance
of
death
to
a
triumphant
progress
where
blood
and
flame
rode
by
with
clouds
for
chargers
and
earth
and
sky
themselves
shouldered
the
litter
of
their
passing
king
an
exclamation
of
wonder
broke
from
adèle
and
jill
cried
to
me
to
stop
just
for
a
minute
boy
so
that
she
can
see
it
properly
obediently
i
slowed
to
a
standstill
then
i
backed
the
great
car
and
swung
up
a
side
track
for
the
length
of
a
the
few
cubits
thus
added
to
our
stature
extended
the
prospect
appreciably
besides
it
was
now
unnecessary
to
crane
the
neck
at
last
if
you
waiting
for
me
to
say
said
adèle
i
should
quite
ready
to
sit
here
till
nightfall
it
up
to
you
to
tear
me
away
i
looked
at
jill
better
be
getting
on
i
said
the
others
be
wondering
where
we
are
she
nodded
we
did
not
stop
again
till
the
car
came
to
rest
easily
before
the
great
oak
door
which
those
who
built
white
ladies
hung
upon
its
tremendous
hinges
somewhere
in
the
of
the
sixteenth
century
it
is
my
duty
said
berry
to
inform
you
that
on
wednesday
i
shall
not
be
available
why
said
my
wife
because
upon
that
day
i
propose
to
dispense
justice
in
my
capacity
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
i
shall
discriminate
between
neither
rich
nor
poor
beggars
and
billionaires
shall
get
it
equally
in
the
neck
innocent
and
guilty
alike
that
do
said
daphne
what
about
thursday
thursday
clear
one
moment
though
i
had
an
idea
there
was
something
on
that
day
for
a
second
he
drummed
on
the
table
clearly
cudgelling
his
brains
suddenly
i
knew
it
he
cried
that
the
day
of
the
sale
you
know
merry
down
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
my
memory
i
got
some
rotten
news
what
daphne
jill
jonah
and
i
fired
the
question
simultaneously
a
terrible
fellow
after
it
one
dunkelsbaum
origin
doubtful
very
last
known
address
argentina
naturalized
in
july
strictly
neutral
during
the
war
but
managed
to
net
over
a
million
out
of
cotton
which
he
sold
to
the
central
powers
a
lower
price
than
great
britain
before
we
tightened
the
blockade
never
interned
of
course
well
he
tried
to
buy
merry
down
by
private
treaty
but
sir
anthony
would
sell
to
him
they
say
the
sweep
crazy
about
the
place
and
that
he
means
to
have
it
at
any
price
jolly
is
it
there
was
a
painful
silence
merry
down
was
the
nearest
estate
to
white
ladies
and
was
almost
as
precious
to
us
as
our
own
home
for
over
two
centuries
a
bagot
had
reigned
uninterruptedly
over
the
mansion
and
the
spreading
park
the
brown
water
and
the
waving
woods
a
kingdom
of
which
we
had
been
free
since
childhood
never
an
aged
tree
blew
down
but
we
were
told
of
it
and
now
the
greatest
of
them
all
was
falling
the
house
of
bagot
itself
one
of
the
old
school
sir
anthony
had
stood
his
ground
up
to
the
last
the
war
had
cost
him
dear
his
only
son
was
killed
in
the
first
months
his
only
grandson
fell
in
the
battles
of
the
somme
his
substance
never
fat
had
shrunk
to
a
mere
shadow
of
its
former
self
the
stout
old
heart
fought
the
unequal
fight
month
after
month
stables
were
emptied
rooms
were
shut
up
thing
after
thing
was
sold
it
remained
for
a
defaulting
solicitor
to
administer
the
de
on
the
twelfth
day
of
august
precisely
at
two
merry
down
was
to
be
sold
by
auction
at
fountain
brooch
berry
news
took
our
breath
away
mean
to
say
that
this
is
what
i
fought
for
said
i
for
this
brute
peaceful
possession
of
merry
down
apparently
said
my
more
it
what
derry
bagot
and
his
boy
died
for
if
you
happen
to
be
looking
at
it
that
way
it
break
sir
anthony
heart
said
daphne
but
i
do
understand
said
adèle
how
why
is
it
allowed
i
must
have
notice
said
berry
of
that
question
have
you
ever
heard
said
jonah
of
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
alien
enemies
adèle
shook
her
head
i
think
you
must
have
said
jonah
some
people
call
it
the
british
nation
it
been
going
for
years
that
right
said
i
and
its
motto
is
begins
at
home
there
really
nothing
more
to
be
said
i
could
cry
announced
jill
in
a
voice
that
fully
confirmed
her
statement
it
just
piteous
what
would
poor
derry
say
ca
anything
be
done
berry
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
half
what
i
heard
is
true
merry
down
is
as
good
as
gone
the
fellow
means
to
have
it
and
he
rich
enough
to
buy
the
county
itself
short
of
assassination
i
do
see
what
anybody
can
do
of
course
if
you
like
you
can
reproduce
him
in
wax
and
then
stick
pins
into
the
image
but
that
very
and
renders
you
liable
to
cremation
without
the
option
of
a
fine
besides
as
a
magistrate
i
feel
it
my
bounden
duty
to
i
thought
witchcraft
and
witches
were
out
of
date
said
adèle
not
at
all
said
berry
only
last
week
we
bound
one
over
for
discussing
the
housing
question
with
a
the
animal
which
till
then
had
been
laying
steadily
became
unsettled
and
suspicious
and
finally
attacked
an
inoffensive
stilton
with
every
circumstance
of
barbarity
how
awful
said
adèle
you
do
see
life
as
a
magistrate
do
you
and
i
suppose
somebody
kissed
the
and
it
turned
into
a
french
count
you
know
it
a
shame
about
you
berry
looked
round
mocked
he
said
and
at
my
own
table
with
her
small
mouth
crammed
with
food
for
which
i
shall
be
called
upon
to
pay
she
actually
cried
adèle
it
was
besides
you
should
have
asked
me
i
can
only
say
said
berry
that
i
am
surprised
and
pained
from
the
bosom
of
my
family
i
as
the
head
naturally
expect
nothing
but
the
foulest
scurrility
and
derision
but
when
a
comparative
stranger
whom
with
characteristic
generosity
i
have
made
free
of
my
heart
seizes
a
moment
which
should
have
been
devoted
to
the
mastication
of
one
of
my
peaches
to
vilify
her
host
then
indeed
i
feel
almost
unsexed
i
mean
unmanned
are
my
veins
standing
out
like
cords
only
on
your
nose
said
i
all
gnarled
that
is
there
you
are
said
berry
the
slow
belly
reviles
the
sage
the
scandalized
cries
from
daphne
and
jill
interrupted
him
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
said
his
wife
pushing
back
her
chair
and
now
let
all
have
coffee
on
the
terrace
that
is
unless
you
three
want
to
stay
jonah
berry
and
i
shook
our
heads
and
she
took
adèle
arm
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
it
was
a
wonderful
night
while
nature
slept
magic
sceptred
with
a
wand
sat
on
her
throne
the
sky
was
rich
black
velvet
pricked
at
a
million
points
from
every
one
of
which
issued
a
cold
white
brilliance
just
luminous
enough
to
show
its
whereness
sharp
and
no
slightest
breath
of
wind
ruffled
the
shadows
of
the
sleeping
trees
with
one
intent
night
and
the
countryside
had
filled
the
cup
of
silence
so
that
it
brimmed
a
feat
that
neither
cellarer
can
do
alone
the
faint
sweet
scent
of
honeysuckle
stole
on
its
errant
way
stuff
as
dreams
are
made
on
so
that
the
silken
fabric
of
the
air
took
on
a
tint
of
daintiness
so
rare
fleeting
and
exquisite
as
made
your
fancy
riot
conjuring
mirages
of
smooth
enchantment
gardens
that
hung
luxuriant
beneath
a
languorous
moon
the
plash
of
water
and
the
soft
sob
of
flutes
for
a
long
moment
all
the
world
was
fairy
then
with
a
wild
scrabble
of
claws
upon
stone
a
small
white
shape
shot
from
beneath
my
chair
took
the
broad
steps
at
a
bound
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
the
welter
of
barks
and
growls
and
grunts
of
expended
energy
rising
a
moment
later
from
the
midst
of
the
great
lawn
suggested
that
a
cat
had
retired
to
the
convenient
shelter
of
the
mulberry
tree
the
sudden
eruption
startled
us
all
and
berry
dwelt
with
some
asperity
upon
the
danger
of
distracting
the
digestive
organs
while
at
work
menacingly
i
demanded
the
terrier
immediate
return
upon
the
third
time
of
asking
the
uproar
ceased
and
a
few
seconds
later
nobby
came
padding
out
of
the
gloom
with
the
cheerful
demeanour
of
the
labourer
who
has
done
well
and
shown
himself
worthy
of
his
hire
wise
in
his
generation
he
had
learned
that
it
is
a
hard
heart
which
the
pleasurable
if
mistaken
glow
of
faithful
service
will
not
disarm
sternly
i
set
the
miscreant
upon
my
knee
for
a
moment
we
eyed
one
another
with
mutual
mistrust
and
understanding
then
he
thrust
up
a
wet
nose
and
licked
my
face
for
a
minute
or
two
there
was
no
noise
save
the
occasional
chink
of
a
against
its
saucer
then
since
you
ask
me
said
berry
my
horoscope
is
of
peculiar
interest
what
a
horoscope
said
jill
a
cross
between
a
birth
certificate
and
a
conduct
sheet
said
i
nodding
at
berry
his
is
a
wonder
you
can
get
a
copy
of
it
for
three
and
sixpence
at
scotland
yard
i
was
born
said
my
when
uranus
was
in
conjunction
saturn
in
opposition
and
the
conservatives
in
power
venus
was
all
gibbous
the
zodiac
was
in
its
zenith
and
the
zenith
was
in
wain
commonly
called
the
cart
my
sign
was
oleaqua
the
man
with
the
watering
pot
when
i
add
that
a
thunderstorm
was
raging
and
that
my
father
had
bet
five
pounds
i
should
be
a
girl
and
had
decided
to
call
me
you
will
appreciate
that
it
is
no
ordinary
being
who
is
addressing
you
a
singularly
beautiful
infant
it
was
at
once
obvious
that
i
was
born
to
rule
several
people
said
it
was
inevitable
among
them
an
who
was
ordered
out
of
the
grounds
to
which
during
the
excitement
he
had
gained
access
he
did
put
it
that
way
but
he
explained
at
the
police
court
that
that
was
what
he
had
meant
to
whose
good
offices
said
jonah
do
you
ascribe
your
pretty
ways
uranus
was
the
airy
reply
from
that
deity
came
also
meekness
an
unshakable
belief
in
human
nature
and
the
fidgets
you
ought
to
have
been
called
after
him
said
adèle
my
godfathers
thought
otherwise
in
a
fit
of
generosity
they
gave
me
my
name
and
a
pint
pot
which
the
more
credulous
declared
to
be
silver
but
whose
hallmark
persistently
defied
detection
then
the
fount
dried
up
and
now
let
me
read
your
hand
or
would
you
rather
i
taught
you
the
trick
it
too
dark
i
protested
besides
she
going
to
sing
who
said
so
said
adèle
i
was
going
to
suggest
that
you
told
us
a
fairy
tale
a
song
for
a
tale
said
i
done
there
was
once
a
princess
said
i
with
eyes
like
brown
stars
and
a
voice
like
the
song
of
a
silver
brook
one
day
she
was
sitting
all
alone
by
the
side
of
a
shady
when
she
heard
a
bell
for
a
moment
she
thought
she
was
dreaming
for
she
was
rather
tired
then
she
heard
it
again
a
clear
tinkle
which
seemed
to
arise
from
the
heart
of
the
stream
itself
this
surprised
the
princess
very
much
because
no
bells
were
allowed
in
her
father
kingdom
the
old
man
was
a
bit
of
an
autocrat
and
one
morning
when
he
had
been
rung
up
seven
times
running
by
subjects
who
wanted
quite
a
different
number
he
just
passed
a
law
prohibiting
bells
and
that
was
that
well
while
she
was
wondering
what
to
do
the
bell
rang
again
rather
angrily
and
before
she
knew
where
she
was
she
had
said
in
last
said
a
voice
and
a
large
frog
heaved
himself
out
of
the
water
and
sat
down
on
a
tuft
of
grass
on
the
opposite
bank
knock
next
time
did
hear
you
knock
said
the
princess
did
said
the
frog
rang
how
your
father
of
beans
said
the
princess
yours
my
business
said
the
frog
you
married
yet
such
luck
said
the
princess
what
more
i
never
shall
be
said
the
frog
the
kingdom
goes
with
you
does
it
said
the
princess
there
the
rub
said
the
frog
looking
round
i
all
right
said
the
princess
who
wants
half
a
kingdom
that
mortgaged
up
to
the
hilt
and
a
bit
over
at
this
the
frog
looked
so
wise
that
the
princess
felt
quite
uncomfortable
and
began
to
think
he
must
be
a
waiter
at
the
athenæum
who
had
had
a
misunderstanding
with
a
witch
suddenly
of
your
suitors
do
you
like
best
said
the
frog
the
watchguard
said
the
princess
a
bit
of
a
fool
but
you
ought
to
see
him
dance
i
ought
said
the
frog
would
be
extremely
bad
for
me
listen
tell
albert
to
come
down
here
with
a
sieve
morning
he
may
be
a
bit
of
a
fool
but
if
he
does
apply
for
you
before
lunch
he
a
congenital
idiot
and
with
that
he
took
a
short
run
and
dived
into
the
stream
the
princess
did
as
she
was
bid
and
at
eleven
the
next
morning
albert
the
watchguard
appeared
complete
with
sieve
upon
the
bank
of
the
minutes
later
with
a
cigarette
behind
his
ear
and
nugget
of
gold
in
each
he
made
formal
application
for
the
hand
of
the
princess
and
half
the
kingdom
a
request
which
was
immediately
granted
two
days
later
they
were
married
what
albert
the
watchguard
said
on
learning
that
his
half
of
the
kingdom
did
not
include
the
territory
watered
by
the
is
not
recorded
if
you
remember
he
was
a
bit
of
a
fool
good
for
you
old
chap
said
daphne
jill
hand
stole
out
of
the
darkness
and
crept
into
mine
berry
turned
to
adèle
a
blinking
wonder
he
said
is
not
he
fancy
turning
out
a
comic
cameo
like
that
on
demand
but
then
for
years
he
been
on
the
staff
of
he
does
the
column
adèle
laughed
musically
it
was
very
nice
of
him
to
do
as
i
asked
she
said
and
as
a
bargain
a
bargain
she
rose
and
turned
to
the
open
windows
i
saw
her
settled
at
the
piano
and
then
stole
back
a
moment
later
the
strains
of
her
beautiful
floated
out
into
the
darkness
it
is
doubtful
whether
qui
ever
enjoyed
a
more
exquisite
setting
it
was
a
wonderful
night
if
we
had
driven
straight
to
brooch
the
incident
would
not
have
occurred
we
had
lunched
early
for
berry
and
i
were
determined
to
attend
the
sale
of
merry
down
sir
anthony
who
was
sure
to
be
there
would
need
comforting
and
we
had
moreover
a
feeling
that
we
should
like
to
see
the
last
of
an
old
friend
once
the
place
had
passed
into
the
power
of
the
dog
we
should
try
to
forget
it
was
adèle
suggestion
that
she
should
accompany
us
i
like
to
see
brooch
she
had
said
and
i
want
to
get
a
new
piece
of
silk
for
my
wristwatch
besides
i
can
sit
in
the
car
while
you
and
berry
are
at
the
sale
that
save
your
taking
the
chauffeur
we
agreed
readily
enough
because
adèle
was
with
us
we
started
in
good
time
so
that
we
could
go
by
way
of
hickory
hammer
and
three
horse
hill
that
way
would
bring
us
on
to
the
london
road
at
a
point
five
miles
from
brooch
and
while
the
view
from
the
hill
was
as
fine
as
any
in
the
neighbourhood
hickory
hammer
was
not
only
extremely
ancient
but
generally
accounted
one
of
the
most
picturesque
villages
in
the
whole
of
england
i
was
driving
with
nobby
beside
me
while
adèle
and
berry
sat
on
the
back
seat
our
thoughts
were
not
unnaturally
dwelling
upon
the
sale
and
now
and
again
i
caught
fragments
of
conversation
which
suggested
that
my
was
commenting
upon
the
power
of
money
and
the
physiognomy
of
dunkelsbaum
whose
photograph
had
appeared
in
the
paper
that
very
morning
to
grace
an
interview
with
marked
acerbity
once
in
a
while
a
ripple
of
laughter
from
adèle
came
to
my
ears
but
for
the
most
part
it
was
a
grave
discourse
for
berry
felt
very
bitter
and
adèle
whose
father
father
was
the
son
of
an
english
squire
had
taken
to
heart
the
imminent
disseizure
with
a
rare
sympathy
it
was
five
minutes
to
two
when
we
slid
out
of
lullaby
coppice
and
on
to
the
london
road
a
furlong
ahead
the
road
swung
awkwardly
to
the
left
a
bend
which
the
unexpected
of
a
rendered
a
veritable
pitfall
for
the
unwary
motorist
i
slowed
for
the
turn
cautiously
for
i
knew
the
place
but
i
was
not
surprised
when
on
rounding
the
corner
we
found
ourselves
confronted
with
a
state
of
affairs
presenting
all
the
elements
of
a
smash
what
had
happened
was
transparently
clear
huddled
between
a
trolley
and
the
nearside
bank
which
was
rising
sheer
from
the
road
was
a
large
red
limousine
listing
heavily
to
port
and
down
by
the
head
both
vehicles
were
facing
towards
brooch
plainly
the
car
had
sought
to
overtake
the
trolley
which
was
in
the
act
of
emerging
from
the
and
pass
it
upon
the
wrong
side
the
former
of
course
had
been
travelling
too
fast
to
stop
and
the
burden
which
the
latter
was
bearing
had
made
it
impossible
for
the
other
to
pass
upon
the
side
three
sturdy
oaks
new
felled
one
of
them
full
fifty
swaying
feet
in
length
all
of
them
girt
by
chains
on
to
the
back
made
a
redoubtable
obstruction
the
chauffeur
had
taken
the
only
possible
course
and
dashed
for
the
narrowing
passage
on
the
left
a
second
too
late
the
car
had
been
pinched
between
the
great
wain
and
the
unyielding
bank
like
a
nut
between
the
jaws
of
the
crackers
but
for
the
action
of
the
carter
who
had
stopped
his
team
dead
the
car
would
have
been
crushed
to
flinders
the
two
occupants
of
the
limousine
were
apparently
unhurt
for
when
i
first
saw
them
they
were
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
road
looking
anxiously
in
our
direction
the
next
moment
they
were
signalling
to
us
violently
spreading
out
ridiculous
arms
as
if
the
were
not
putting
our
passage
of
the
road
for
the
present
out
of
the
question
as
i
brought
the
rolls
to
a
standstill
i
heard
a
stifled
cry
the
next
moment
berry
voice
hissed
in
my
ear
talk
of
the
devil
look
at
the
cove
on
the
right
dunkelsbaum
a
lightning
glance
showed
me
the
truth
of
his
words
the
original
of
the
photograph
over
which
we
had
pored
that
morning
was
standing
before
us
in
all
the
grossness
of
flesh
almost
before
i
had
recovered
from
the
shock
the
other
a
long
sallow
creature
with
a
false
grin
and
a
cringing
air
was
at
my
elbow
you
mutht
eckthcuthe
me
he
lisped
uncovering
but
could
you
pothibly
give
uth
a
lift
ath
far
ath
brooch
thith
gentleman
he
indicated
dunkelsbaum
hath
a
motht
important
engagement
there
at
two
and
ath
you
thee
we
have
been
unfortunate
tho
if
you
could
thee
your
way
to
accommodating
uth
we
thould
be
greatly
obliged
before
i
could
reply
we
can
get
there
by
two
said
berry
speaking
slowly
and
distinctly
if
we
go
through
now
ramilly
was
a
great
enclosure
and
could
be
entered
from
the
down
which
the
trolley
had
come
it
was
not
on
the
way
to
with
the
greatest
difficulty
i
repressed
a
start
then
i
leaned
forward
as
if
to
examine
the
dash
but
in
reality
to
conceal
my
excitement
guileless
my
protasis
was
nothing
less
than
a
deliberate
direction
to
me
to
postpone
dunkelsbaum
arrival
at
brooch
until
merry
down
was
no
longer
in
the
my
heart
began
to
beat
violently
berry
was
speaking
again
wait
half
a
minute
and
we
change
over
he
turned
to
adèle
will
you
sit
in
front
with
boy
as
the
change
was
being
made
dunkelsbaum
advanced
i
have
seldom
set
eyes
upon
a
less
prepossessing
man
to
liken
him
to
a
vicious
pug
is
more
than
charitable
smug
and
evil
his
bloated
countenance
was
most
suggestive
there
was
no
pity
about
the
coarse
mouth
which
he
had
twisted
into
a
smile
two
deep
sneer
lines
cut
into
the
unwholesome
pallor
of
his
cheeks
from
under
drooping
lids
two
beady
eyes
shifted
their
keen
appraising
glance
from
me
to
berry
and
for
a
short
second
to
adèle
there
was
about
him
not
a
single
redeeming
feature
and
for
the
brute
pompous
carriage
alone
i
could
have
kicked
him
heartily
the
clothes
were
like
unto
the
man
from
beneath
a
overcoat
which
he
wore
unbuttoned
the
rich
contour
of
a
white
waistcoat
thrust
its
outrageous
way
spurning
the
decent
shelter
of
a
black
and
making
the
thick
striped
legs
look
shorter
than
ever
a
diamond
pin
winked
in
the
satin
tie
and
a
black
bowler
hat
and
boots
mercifully
covered
the
one
his
crown
and
the
others
his
short
fat
feet
my
gentleman
raised
his
hat
and
removed
a
cigar
from
his
mouth
before
speaking
in
a
thick
voice
and
with
a
strong
foreign
accent
my
segretary
tol
you
of
my
agsident
yes
i
voz
much
oblige
vor
a
lif
to
brrrrooch
these
gattle
contemptuously
he
pointed
to
the
waggoner
and
his
great
beasts
to
whose
common
sagacity
he
owed
his
life
should
not
allowed
be
on
der
roats
no
ach
so
it
voz
all
wrong
quite
so
said
berry
i
think
they
worse
than
pedestrians
if
i
had
my
way
nothing
but
cars
would
be
allowed
on
any
high
road
if
people
ca
afford
cars
let
them
keep
to
the
lanes
so
i
say
often
what
vor
are
der
baths
an
lanes
else
bah
by
now
adèle
had
taken
her
seat
in
front
and
my
who
had
descended
was
ushering
dunkelsbaum
into
the
place
she
had
left
with
a
grunt
the
fellow
made
to
hoist
himself
in
when
nobby
took
a
flying
leap
from
the
front
seat
and
planted
himself
in
the
path
barking
furiously
immediately
withdrawing
the
foot
which
he
had
set
upon
the
carpet
dunkelsbaum
descended
anyhow
on
to
his
secretary
who
was
not
expecting
him
and
so
too
late
to
recede
the
scream
of
agony
which
the
unfortunate
creature
emitted
no
less
than
the
convulsive
way
in
which
he
clung
to
the
wing
while
standing
upon
one
leg
and
protesting
with
a
horrible
leer
that
he
was
unhurt
gave
the
lie
to
his
words
his
employer
spoke
at
once
and
to
the
point
den
if
you
no
what
vor
you
yell
in
mine
bah
he
turned
to
me
you
vill
blease
gondrol
der
mastering
a
desire
to
do
the
man
violence
i
leaned
out
and
over
the
back
of
my
seat
and
taking
nobby
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
hauled
him
struggling
and
growling
across
the
barrier
adèle
received
him
tenderly
and
endeavoured
to
soothe
him
but
the
sealyham
was
mourning
a
lost
opportunity
and
would
not
be
comforted
bluntly
commanding
his
creature
to
stay
with
the
car
and
arrange
for
its
salvage
dunkelsbaum
once
more
heaved
himself
into
the
rolls
and
sank
upon
the
back
seat
berry
followed
and
a
moment
later
i
had
let
in
the
clutch
and
turned
up
the
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
entrance
to
the
enclosure
it
was
ten
minutes
past
two
and
as
berry
got
out
to
open
and
hold
the
gate
i
saw
our
passenger
bring
out
a
handsome
timepiece
and
after
a
glance
at
the
dial
replace
it
in
some
uneasiness
your
dime
voz
der
same
as
london
he
inquired
five
minutes
ahead
i
replied
maliciously
ach
we
shall
do
it
all
right
i
said
airily
your
appointment
at
three
is
it
dunkelsbaum
went
a
rich
green
colour
half
rose
from
his
seat
and
clawed
at
the
air
before
replying
three
he
raved
three
no
no
doo
man
doo
say
it
voz
three
in
a
quarder
of
an
hour
ve
mus
be
dere
it
is
fital
yes
adèle
began
to
shake
with
laughter
right
oh
i
said
casually
i
dare
say
we
can
manage
it
the
gate
was
open
and
i
let
in
the
clutch
with
a
bang
with
a
startled
grunt
dunkelsbaum
was
projected
violently
on
to
the
seat
he
had
left
as
i
slowed
up
for
berry
to
rejoin
us
but
i
may
have
to
go
rather
fast
i
added
like
der
devil
was
the
reply
the
going
was
good
and
the
road
was
unfrequented
so
i
let
the
car
out
we
tore
down
an
avenue
of
firs
great
rugged
banks
of
rhododendrons
sprawling
on
either
side
scudded
into
a
beechwood
pillars
all
set
in
a
ruffled
mass
of
whispering
green
swam
through
a
sea
of
bracken
rippling
and
feathery
and
all
the
time
i
was
racking
my
brain
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
we
had
another
three
miles
to
cover
before
we
should
emerge
from
ramilly
on
to
the
king
highway
but
at
the
very
point
at
which
we
should
leave
the
enclosure
there
were
crossroads
and
i
was
sure
a
announcing
the
way
to
brooch
in
a
plain
manner
which
there
was
no
mistaking
in
the
face
of
this
direction
which
our
passenger
would
be
certain
to
see
it
would
be
impossible
to
take
another
road
and
though
we
should
undoubtedly
reach
after
the
appointed
hour
it
was
quite
possible
that
the
proceedings
might
not
be
punctually
conducted
and
that
the
essential
business
of
the
sale
would
not
have
been
completed
before
our
arrival
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
throwing
off
the
mask
stopping
the
car
and
politely
intimating
our
inability
to
carry
dunkelsbaum
any
further
but
his
reception
of
such
an
open
declaration
of
war
was
certain
to
be
unsuitable
for
adèle
eyes
and
ears
and
the
subsequent
action
which
a
man
of
his
calibre
would
undoubtedly
take
might
prove
troublesome
if
profitless
again
our
eventual
arrival
at
brooch
however
belated
would
be
better
avoided
berry
and
i
were
well
known
in
the
town
as
was
also
our
close
friendship
with
sir
anthony
our
identification
therefore
would
be
only
a
matter
of
time
and
since
in
the
absence
of
a
burst
or
a
puncture
our
progress
to
brooch
could
only
be
delayed
by
pretended
engine
trouble
the
suspicions
which
this
would
be
sure
to
arouse
in
our
passenger
mind
would
very
soon
be
confirmed
sooner
or
later
the
fellow
would
gather
that
he
had
been
befooled
but
provided
that
we
preserved
our
incognitos
that
did
not
matter
if
we
could
possibly
leave
him
uncertain
whether
we
were
as
cunning
as
serpents
or
as
simple
as
doves
so
much
the
better
in
no
sort
of
order
all
these
reflections
elbowed
and
jostled
one
another
before
my
mind
eye
which
was
itself
searching
feverishly
for
a
solution
then
we
floated
round
a
long
curve
and
i
saw
the
splash
we
were
at
the
top
of
a
short
steep
hill
in
the
midst
of
a
dense
wood
of
tender
years
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
our
road
was
overrun
by
a
stream
so
that
while
there
was
a
little
vehicles
that
were
wishing
to
pass
this
way
must
do
so
by
way
of
the
ford
beyond
the
water
the
ground
rose
sharply
again
making
the
whole
place
a
bottom
or
hollow
such
as
was
commonly
encountered
in
this
part
of
england
i
slowed
up
and
we
slid
down
the
hill
at
a
reduced
speed
with
the
utmost
caution
i
put
the
rolls
at
the
splash
making
no
attempt
to
disguise
my
uneasiness
dunkelsbaum
would
naturally
conclude
that
i
was
anxious
lest
the
water
was
deep
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
was
fearful
lest
the
ford
should
prove
shallow
but
luck
was
with
us
very
gently
the
great
car
entered
the
brown
water
which
was
flowing
slowly
and
steadily
over
its
gravel
bed
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
watched
the
water
rise
it
was
to
the
it
was
level
above
it
was
lapping
the
spare
wheel
and
we
were
in
the
deepest
part
quick
as
a
flash
i
changed
into
top
and
let
in
the
clutch
with
a
bang
instantly
the
engine
stopped
and
the
car
came
to
rest
in
i
took
out
my
handkerchief
and
wiped
my
face
there
was
an
electric
silence
then
what
the
matter
said
berry
flooded
out
i
said
shortly
hoping
that
dunkelsbaum
was
not
an
engineer
as
i
spoke
i
heard
a
choking
sound
at
my
shoulder
i
turned
sharply
and
there
was
my
gentleman
in
a
terrible
toss
his
eyes
were
protruding
and
he
could
hardly
speak
to
brrrooch
he
screamed
to
brrrooch
ve
mus
go
on
i
say
it
is
fital
sdard

man
sdard

gar
what

i
said
coolly
but
you
have
to
get
out
our
only
chance
is
to
make
her
as
light
as
possible
with
a
saintly
look
berry
opened
the
door
and
sprang
nimbly
on
to
the
then
he
turned
to
the
other
come
along
sir
dunkelsbaum
stared
at
the
water
as
if
it
had
been
boiling
oil
as
he
estimated
the
distance
he
was
to
cover
a
bead
of
perspiration
began
to
course
down
his
face
it
was
the
first
of
many
berry
extended
his
hand
come
along
sir
the
fellow
threw
one
despairing
glance
about
him
hung
out
of
the
car
till
he
could
reach
berry
hand
and
then
with
a
frightful
grunt
into
space
the
sight
of
dunkelsbaum
still
with
berry
endeavouring
by
the
latter
direction
to
step
out
of
twelve
inches
of
water
on
to
the
a
feat
which
only
a
contortionist
could
have
accomplished
was
diverting
in
the
extreme
but
when
the
unfortunate
creature
did
by
some
superhuman
effort
get
the
elongated
toe
of
his
right
boot
upon
the
plank
and
berry
found
himself
unable
to
do
more
than
haul
him
to
safety
so
that
for
one
long
hectic
moment
he
hung
writhing
convulsively
frantically
waving
his
left
leg
in
quest
of
a
footing
and
alternately
calling
upon
heaven
and
frenziedly
charging
his
betrayer
not
to
let
go
when
as
a
result
of
muscular
vibration
his
left
boot
worked
loose
and
fell
into
the
water
with
a
derisive
plop
when
nobby
who
had
been
watching
the
efforts
of
the
storming
party
in
a
fever
of
excitement
leapt
from
adèle
arms
on
to
my
shoulders
and
thence
into
the
flood
and
beating
its
raving
owner
by
a
matter
of
inches
in
a
rush
for
the
errant
footgear
splashed
his
triumphant
way
to
the
bank
and
amid
a
hurricane
of
execration
bore
his
waterlogged
trophy
into
the
undergrowth
then
i
bowed
my
head
upon
the
and
throwing
decency
to
the
winds
ran
before
the
tempest
of
titanic
laughter
a
wail
of
merriment
from
adèle
and
a
pressure
upon
my
left
arm
brought
me
to
my
senses
watch
in
hand
dunkelsbaum
was
dancing
upon
a
strip
of
turf
by
the
edge
of
the
stream
bellowing
at
me
to
start
the
car
i
do

the
yell
with
which
he
delivered
the
last
sentence
changed
to
a
howl
as
his
bootless
foot
alighted
heavily
upon
an
odd
pebble
and
nobby
peered
out
of
some
long
grass
boot
in
mouth
to
see
whether
the
situation
was
affording
further
opportunities
apparently
it
was
not
for
he
lay
down
where
he
was
and
proceeded
with
the
dismemberment
of
his
spoil
adèle
turned
her
head
away
and
held
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
i
set
my
foot
upon
the
the
moment
the
engine
started
nobby
abandoned
his
treasure
and
leapt
barking
to
the
side
of
the
car
fearful
as
usual
lest
he
be
left
behind
muttering
hideously
dunkelsbaum
seized
the
opportunity
of
retrieving
his
boot
whose
present
condition
was
apparently
even
worse
than
he
had
expected
for
a
hurried
examination
of
the
same
elicited
an
involuntary
cry
of
torment
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
terrier
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
fury
slowly
i
brought
the
rolls
out
of
the
splash
and
when
as
i
judged
about
six
feet
lay
between
the
back
wheels
and
the
stream
again
i
stopped
the
engine
for
a
moment
i
thought
dunkelsbaum
would
offer
me
violence
his
mouth
worked
uncontrollably
and
there
was
a
suspicion
of
foam
upon
the
thick
lips
a
sudden
violent
tug
at
the
boot
which
was
still
in
his
right
hand
awaiting
replacement
mercifully
diverted
his
attention
but
the
savagery
with
which
he
launched
a
kick
at
nobby
who
was
once
more
in
possession
and
already
out
of
range
was
terrible
to
witness
he
screamed
you

to

and
gesticulating
what

still
you
mus
sdard
again
an
again
yes
to
brrrooch
to
brrrooch
he
snatched
his
watch
from
his
pocket
and
dabbed
at
its
face
with
a
shaking
forefinger

the

of
my
compunction
which
had
been
putting
up
a
fight
vanished
into
thin
air
the
sweep
had
offered
me
money
i
was
prepared
to
twist
his
tall
indefinitely
if
you
pushed
behind
i
said
coldly
we
might
get
her
going
if
we
do
you
must
get
in
while
she
moving
i
dare
stop
or
we
may
have
to
begin
all
over
again
dunkelsbaum
eyed
me
suspiciously
and
berry
who
had
been
hitherto
afraid
to
trust
his
voice
took
up
the
running
with
a
dash
that
the
ticket
come
on
herr
stunkenblotch
never
mind
your
boot
think
of
the
purchase
you
get
with
a
bare
foot
he
stepped
behind
the
car
now
you
do
as
i
do
and
when
i
say
drop
your
bullet
head
and
try
to
shove
the
old
into
the
middle
of
next
fortnight
with
a
snarl
dunkelsbaum
slunk
limping
to
the
back
of
the
car
a
moment
later
go
said
my
maliciously
i
waited
the
best
part
of
thirty
seconds
then
are
you
ready
i
inquired
innocently
enough
the
explosion
which
my
question
provoked
was
truly
terrible
the
panting
alien
and
berry
immediately
reappeared
one
upon
either
side
of
the
car
the
latter
protesting
with
an
injured
air
that
he
was
not
so
young
as
he
was
and
that
if
i
wanted
him
to
survive
the
summer
i
had
better
keep
my
ears
open
while
to
judge
from
his
behaviour
the
reflection
that
his
recent
output
of
vigour
had
been
rendered
nugatory
by
my
unreadiness
was
hurrying
dunkelsbaum
into
the
valley
of
insanity
purple
in
the
face
from
the
unwonted
violence
of
his
physical
and
mental
exercise
streaming
with
perspiration
and
shaking
with
passion
the
fellow
stormed
and
raved
like
a
demoniac
and
if
berry
had
not
stepped
in
front
of
the
bonnet
and
taking
him
by
the
arm
led
him
again
to
the
back
of
the
car
i
believe
he
would
have
fallen
down
in
a
fit
are
you
ready
i
called
a
hurricane
of
affirmatory
invective
answered
me
i
started
the
engine
changed
into
first
and
let
in
the
clutch
as
i
changed
into
second
uprose
a
medley
of
cries
and
barking
i
leaned
out
exhorting
the
pedestrians
by
words
and
gestures
to
come
aboard
head
up
teeth
bared
fists
clenched
and
arms
working
dunkelsbaum
was
running
like
a
stag
berry
was
loping
along
just
behind
apparently
offering
encouragement
and
advice
while
the
sealyham
was
alternately
running
and
jumping
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
frantic
alien
barking
as
if
he
were
possessed
even
as
i
looked
the
inevitable
happened
nobby
miscalculated
his
distance
and
landed
too
close
to
the
object
of
his
attentions
berry
gave
a
warning
but
belated
shout
and
dunkelsbaum
made
a
desperate
effort
to
avoid
the
tripped
recovered
himself
crossed
his
legs
and
with
an
unearthly
cry
fell
heavily
to
the
ground
i
changed
into
third
speed
as
we
swung
round
the
corner
at
the
top
of
the
hill
i
threw
a
glance
over
my
shoulder
berry
was
sitting
on
the
bank
by
the
side
of
the
road
with
his
head
in
his
hands
dunkelsbaum
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
was
in
the
act
of
hurling
himself
in
the
direction
of
nobby
and
the
latter
with
his
small
tail
well
over
his
back
was
circling
delightedly
about
his
victim
still
barking
like
a
fiend
and
ricochetting
like
a
roulette
ball
the
next
moment
we
were
out
of
sight
and
i
changed
into
top
speed
adèle
caught
at
my
arm
you
not
going
to
leave
them
i
nodded
best
way
out
i
said
berry
understand
and
pull
out
somehow
you
see
we
too
well
known
about
here
to
take
any
chances
and
now
i
think
we
slip
along
to
and
find
sir
anthony
you
tell
me
i
speak
good
english
said
adèle
so
you
do
well
i
do
want
to
spoil
my
record
what
the
for
nerve
ca
be
done
said
i
but
i
can
put
your
mouth
into
italian
bella
now
is
that
nice
the
sweet
pretty
lips
began
to
tremble
with
laughter
you
incorrigible
she
announced
fifteen
long
months
and
you
have
changed
a
bit
long
months
adèle
the
soft
rose
of
her
cheeks
was
glowing
as
she
turned
to
reply
the
longest
i
ever
spent
she
said
softly
that
that
the
worst
of
cutting
your
hair
i
thought
it
was
never
going
to
grow
they
been
very
long
ones
for
me
adèle
up
went
the
delicate
eyebrows
have
they
i
nodded
a
close
scrutiny
will
reveal
that
my
hair
once
a
rich
mud
colour
is
now
flecked
with
grey
i
should
attribute
that
to
the
march
of
time
i
shook
my
head
the
responsibility
i
said
rests
with
the
united
states
of
america
seriously
i
missed
you
terribly
that
said
adèle
i
refuse
to
believe
if
you
had
you
would
have
paid
us
a
visit
i
was
not
invited
adèle
shrugged
her
shoulders
any
old
way
she
announced
i
here
now
and
while
we
on
the
subject
of
hair
please
remember
that
since
you
last
saw
me
i
put
mine
up
which
means
that
i
am
a
dangerous
woman
of
the
world
who
gives
nothing
and
takes
everything
with
a
grain
of
salt
i
warn
you
i
changed
unquestionably
said
i
you
have
had
a
violent
that
is
as
plain
as
is
the
dainty
nose
upon
your
charming
face
adèle
regarded
me
with
a
dazzling
smile
i
forgot
she
said
that
i
was
addressing
an
expert
tell
me
think
i
shall
get
over
it
if
you
do
said
i
it
sha
be
my
fault
you
very
good
not
at
all
said
i
can
you
spell
for
a
man
who
had
just
parted
with
the
home
of
his
fathers
poor
old
sir
anthony
was
in
high
spirits
lock
stock
and
barrel
merry
down
had
been
sold
to
the
highest
bidder
of
that
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
what
was
more
to
the
point
was
that
the
purchaser
who
had
paid
a
good
price
was
of
english
blood
and
had
known
derry
bagot
at
eton
and
soldiered
with
him
first
in
south
africa
and
afterwards
in
france
the
place
had
passed
into
good
clean
hands
and
was
to
be
well
cared
for
a
very
civil
fellow
said
sir
anthony
whom
we
had
brought
back
to
white
ladies
to
tea
and
a
sportsman
i
truly
thankful
spoke
so
nicely
of
derry
said
he
always
looked
up
to
him
and
he
was
proud
to
think
he
was
to
carry
on
his
his
home
his
voice
faltered
and
something
of
the
old
stricken
look
hung
for
an
instant
in
the
keen
grey
eyes
the
next
moment
it
was
ousted
by
the
flash
of
victory
and
they
were
bent
upon
me
so
you
deported
the
alien
to
ramilly
gad
but
liked
to
see
the
terrier
bring
him
down
as
he
spoke
there
was
the
noise
of
a
familiar
scamper
and
a
moment
later
nobby
had
hurled
himself
across
the
terrace
into
my
lap
and
was
licking
my
face
with
an
enthusiastic
violence
which
could
not
have
been
more
pronounced
if
he
had
not
seen
me
for
years
and
in
his
wake
came
berry
i
had
told
sir
anthony
that
if
he
desired
to
thank
any
one
he
must
thank
my
because
but
for
the
latter
quick
wit
merry
down
would
have
fallen
into
the
enemy
hands
but
when
the
old
baronet
had
clapped
him
upon
the
back
berry
nodded
at
me
i
believe
he
said
i
was
the
first
to
conceive
the
felony
that
comes
of
being
a
magistrate
but
that
the
merchant
who
carried
it
out
largely
at
my
expense
i
admit
but
that
a
matter
for
him
and
me
to
settle
i
tell
you
sir
anthony
you
must
thank
him
and
the
er
a
more
masterly
display
of
devilry
i
never
witnessed
he
sank
into
a
chair
let
refreshment
be
brought
me
daphne
blew
him
a
kiss
one
moment
old
chap
did
the
servants
see
you
come
in
her
husband
nodded
then
there
be
some
fresh
tea
in
a
moment
and
now
what
happened
we
simply
wild
to
hear
yes
cried
jill
eagerly
and
did
you
really
call
him
and
what
happened
to
his
boot
and
where
the
last
thing
we
saw
said
adèle
was
the
fellow
get
up
and
go
for
nobby
you
were
sitting
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
before
you
begin
said
i
let
me
say
that
i
would
have
left
you
brother
if
i
could
have
thought
of
any
other
way
out
but
it
seemed
the
only
thing
to
do
berry
put
up
his
hand
strange
as
it
may
seem
he
said
for
once
i
do
blame
you
if
i
had
been
so
weak
with
laughter
i
might
have
boarded
the
car
but
it
was
then
or
never
i
did
expect
you
to
wait
how
did
you
get
on
i
fear
said
berry
that
dunkelsbaum
did
expect
the
car
to
be
waiting
at
the
top
of
the
hill
what
he
said
when
he
found
that
the
road
which
we
could
see
for
about
five
furlongs
was
unoccupied
i
shall
try
to
forget
suffice
it
that
he
perspired
with
great
freedom
and
for
a
long
time
appeared
to
be
afflicted
with
an
impediment
in
his
speech
occasionally
he
addressed
me
in
patagonian
but
since
the
only
words
i
could
remember
were
and
my
replies
judging
from
their
reception
were
unsatisfactory
and
sometimes
i
grieve
to
think
even
irrelevant
presently
i
suggested
that
we
should
return
for
his
boot
for
this
he
sought
whilst
i
detained
nobby
i
had
recommended
that
the
services
should
be
employed
in
the
search
but
the
bare
suggestion
provoked
such
a
shocking
outburst
of
profanity
that
i
said
no
more
when
after
exploring
the
undergrowth
for
nearly
half
an
hour
he
suddenly
descried
his
footgear
lodged
in
the
branches
of
a
neighbouring
ash
dunkelsbaum
behaviour
gave
me
cause
to
fear
for
his
reason
my
theory
that
some
fowl
must
have
mistaken
the
truant
for
a
piece
of
refuse
met
with
a
furious
dismissal
and
from
the
perfectly
poisonous
stare
with
which
he
declined
my
offer
of
assistance
to
secure
his
quarry
i
was
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
he
associated
me
with
its
elevation
this
discovery
caused
me
much
pain
but
the
rude
man
was
soon
to
pay
dearly
for
his
foul
suspicion
true
he
got
it
down
but
it
seemed
as
if
the
ravages
of
wear
and
tear
to
say
nothing
of
its
immersion
had
heavily
discounted
the
value
of
the
boot
as
an
article
of
wearing
apparel
for
after
several
agonized
endeavours
to
replace
it
upon
his
foot
dunkelsbaum
screamed
flung
it
down
spat
upon
it
and
offered
up
what
i
took
to
be
a
short
prayer
for
immediate
death
after
this
horrible
exhibition
of
temper
i
felt
that
no
useful
purpose
could
be
served
by
remaining
within
sight
or
earshot
of
the
abandoned
creature
so
i
released
the
terrier
and
made
ready
to
depart
splodgenblunk
i
said
must
now
leave
you
should
you
be
still
anxious
to
arrive
at
bloat
you
can
not
do
better
than
he
interrupted
me
with
a
terrible
cry
vos
neffer
vant
to
arrive
at
bloat
you
said
no
he
raved
vos
i
say
i
affected
the
utmost
surprise
brooch
why
we
came
miles
out
of
our
way
brooch
is
over
there
back
the
way
we
came
out
of
the
enclosure
and
the
first
on
the
right
that
the
worst
of
a
scotch
accent
berry
paused
for
the
laughter
to
subside
as
it
died
down
that
said
i
was
refined
cruelty
i
confess
said
berry
that
compared
with
the
paroxysm
which
succeeded
my
statement
its
predecessors
were
pale
and
colourless
indeed
but
for
a
timely
diversion
i
believe
the
gent
would
have
gone
up
in
smoke
you
see
it
was
like
this
ever
since
his
release
nobby
had
evinced
a
pardonable
curiosity
regarding
dunkelsbaum
bootless
foot
unknown
to
its
owner
he
had
subjected
this
remarkable
member
to
the
closest
scrutiny
and
it
was
in
the
midst
of
the
other
spirited
study
of
lost
soul
that
he
decided
to
remove
the
objectionable
cloak
or
covering
which
it
is
charity
to
describe
as
a
sock
it
was
of
course
unmannerly
the
dog
should
have
controlled
his
morbid
thirst
for
knowledge
but
there
you
are
still
it
was
imprudent
of
dunkelsbaum
to
kick
him
in
the
ribs
i
felt
that
instinctively
had
the
gentleman
remained
to
argue
i
should
have
said
as
much
but
he
did
going
extremely
short
upon
the
near
fore
he
rocketed
down
the
hill
with
nobby
in
the
immediate
future
barking
like
a
fiend
and
striving
so
to
speak
to
take
time
by
the
forelock
from
the
fragment
of
cashmere
with
which
he
presently
returned
i
fear
that
he
was
successful
and
there
you
are
all
things
considered
if
he
still
alive
i
should
think
he
make
brooch
about
eight
he
may
get
a
lift
said
jonah
not
he
once
bitten
twice
shy
after
all
he
asked
for
it
did
he
and
now
shall
i
have
some
tea
or
would
that
be
greedy
sir
anthony
wiped
his
eyes
if
he
known
you
he
crowed
as
well
as
i
do
he
been
more
careful
who
sups
with
the
devil
should
hold
a
long
spoon
i
do
know
what
you
mean
sir
said
berry
i
a
respectable
exactly
said
i
and
meek
thanks
to
uranus
chapter
x
how
adèle
broke
her
dream
and
vandy
pleydell
took
exercise
what
again
said
i
staring
at
the
which
jill
was
offering
me
that
i
might
pass
it
to
daphne
how
many
more
cups
is
he
going
to
drink
he
had
three
to
my
knowledge
that
vessel
said
berry
was
passed
to
you
for
information
and
immediate
action
so
as
they
say
in
the
army
close
your
perishin
head
and
get
down
to
it
what
you
want
said
i
is
a
bucket
or
a
private
urn
what
the
matter
with
a
trough
said
jonah
that
be
more
in
keeping
berry
turned
to
adèle
you
see
he
said
two
putrid
minds
with
but
a
single
snort
but
there
you
are
do
dwell
on
it
pass
the
marmalade
instead
he
turned
to
his
wife
and
what
the
programme
for
the
glass
has
gone
up
it
already
raining
right
with
the
world
anybody
like
to
play
fool
said
his
wife
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
think
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
if
we
went
over
to
broken
ash
for
tea
berry
made
a
grimace
and
jill
and
i
groaned
even
jonah
looked
down
his
nose
at
the
suggestion
yes
my
sister
continued
i
did
think
it
be
a
popular
move
but
i
like
adèle
to
see
the
pictures
and
we
shown
a
sign
of
life
since
we
left
town
at
broken
ash
lived
the
other
branch
of
the
pleydell
family
consisting
of
our
cousin
vandy
and
his
two
sisters
between
them
and
us
there
was
little
love
lost
of
their
jealousy
of
berry
but
for
whose
birth
white
ladies
would
have
passed
into
their
hands
they
made
but
an
open
secret
and
when
he
married
my
sister
who
was
his
second
cousin
and
the
mansels
cousins
jonah
and
jill
had
thrown
in
their
lot
with
us
relations
had
become
more
strained
than
before
the
conventions
were
however
observed
calendars
were
exchanged
at
christmas
birthdays
were
recognized
with
a
cold
epistolary
nod
and
occasional
calls
were
paid
and
invitations
issued
their
possession
of
all
but
two
of
the
family
portraits
was
undoubted
and
with
nine
points
of
the
law
in
their
favour
they
were
well
armed
it
was
an
open
question
whether
the
tenth
point
which
was
ours
was
sufficiently
doughty
to
lay
the
other
nine
by
the
heels
years
ago
counsel
had
advised
that
the
law
was
dead
in
our
favour
but
it
was
certain
that
vandy
and
his
sisters
would
resist
any
claim
we
made
with
great
bitterness
and
the
settlement
of
a
family
quarrel
in
the
public
ring
of
the
high
court
was
more
than
we
could
stomach
still
the
pictures
were
worth
seeing
there
were
a
holbein
a
van
dyck
three
gainsboroughs
and
two
from
the
brush
of
reynolds
among
them
and
so
soon
as
she
had
learned
of
their
existence
adèle
had
evinced
an
eagerness
to
be
shown
the
collection
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
i
hate
to
think
you
were
going
for
my
sake
said
adèle
we
not
dear
said
daphne
even
if
you
were
here
we
should
have
to
go
some
day
soon
yes
said
berry
we
hate
one
another
like
poison
but
we
never
declared
war
consequently
diplomatic
relations
are
still
maintained
and
in
due
season
we
meet
and
are
charmingly
offensive
to
one
another
when
war
broke
out
they
were
very
sticky
about
billeting
a
few
yeomanry
chargers
and
crawled
and
lied
about
their
stabling
till
the
authorities
got
fed
up
and
commandeered
all
they
got
therefore
whenever
we
meet
i
chivvy
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
horseflesh
in
the
same
way
having
regard
to
the
burglary
which
we
suffered
last
month
vandy
will
spread
himself
on
the
subject
of
old
silver
the
moment
they
heard
of
it
they
sent
us
a
triumphant
telegram
of
condolence
my
sister
laughed
if
you
say
much
more
she
said
adèle
will
be
afraid
to
come
with
us
i
admit
it
a
duty
call
pure
and
simple
all
the
same
there
wo
be
any
bloodshed
i
ready
for
anything
said
addle
thoughtfully
shall
i
wear
a
red
or
white
rose
do
tell
us
you
can
control
your
cheeks
said
i
it
unheard
of
and
why
are
you
so
pensive
this
morning
is
it
because
of
ireland
or
have
you
trodden
on
your
sponge
i
believe
she
broken
the
said
berry
and
is
afraid
to
tell
us
do
tease
her
said
jill
why
should
she
be
quiet
if
she
likes
but
adèle
was
bubbling
with
laughter
the
truth
is
she
announced
i
trying
to
remember
a
dream
i
had
last
night
she
looked
across
the
table
to
me
you
know
what
it
is
to
dream
something
rather
vivid
and
interesting
and
then
not
to
be
able
to
remember
what
it
was
i
nodded
but
you
ca
do
anything
i
said
it
no
good
trying
to
remember
it
either
you
think
of
it
or
you
wo
exactly
said
my
there
no
other
alternative
one
of
the
laws
of
nature
i
well
remember
dreaming
that
i
was
a
disused
columbarium
which
had
been
converted
into
a
brewery
and
was
used
as
a
greenhouse
i
was
full
of
vats
and
memorial
tablets
and
creeping
geraniums
just
as
they
were
going
to
pull
me
down
to
make
room
for
a
cinema
daphne
woke
me
up
to
say
there
was
a
bat
in
the
room
i
replied
suitably
but
before
turning
over
to
resume
my
slumbers
i
tried
to
recapture
my
dream
my
efforts
were
vain
it
was
gone
for
ever
then
how
know
what
it
was
about
said
jill
i
do
said
berry
what
i
have
told
you
is
pure
surmise
and
now
will
you
pass
me
the
toast
or
shall
i
come
and
get
it
choking
with
indignation
jill
stretched
out
a
rosy
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
toastrack
suddenly
the
light
of
mischief
leapt
into
her
grey
eyes
and
she
called
nobby
in
a
flash
the
sealyham
never
so
vigilant
as
at
was
by
her
side
cheerfully
she
gave
him
the
last
piece
of
toast
then
she
turned
to
berry
with
a
seraphic
smile
i
afraid
there
none
left
he
said
before
we
had
finished
lunch
the
rain
had
ceased
and
by
the
time
we
were
under
weigh
for
broken
ash
the
afternoon
sun
was
turning
a
wet
world
into
a
jewel
diamonds
dripped
from
her
foliage
emerald
plumes
glistened
on
every
bank
silver
lay
spilt
upon
her
soft
brown
roads
no
was
ever
stuffed
with
such
rare
spicery
out
of
the
dewy
soil
welled
up
the
fresh
clean
breath
of
magic
spikenard
very
precious
punctually
at
four
we
swept
up
the
avenue
of
poplars
that
led
to
our
cousins
house
the
visit
had
been
arranged
by
daphne
upon
the
telephone
and
vandy
and
his
two
sisters
were
ready
and
waiting
the
was
not
cordial
ease
and
familiarity
were
not
among
the
guests
but
it
was
eminently
correct
the
most
exacting
master
of
ceremonies
the
most
severe
authority
upon
etiquette
would
have
been
satisfied
we
were
extraordinarily
polite
we
made
engaging
conversation
we
begged
one
another
pardon
we
enjoyed
one
jokes
the
dispensation
and
acceptance
of
hospitality
did
the
respective
forces
infinite
credit
after
tea
we
were
taken
to
see
the
pictures
vandy
as
showman
naturally
escorted
adèle
the
rest
of
us
decently
grouped
about
his
sisters
followed
like
a
party
of
sightseers
in
the
wake
of
a
verger
to
do
our
host
justice
he
knew
his
own
fathers
for
what
it
was
worth
the
history
of
the
pleydell
family
lay
at
his
fingers
ends
men
manners
and
exploits
he
knew
them
all
indeed
years
ago
he
had
collected
his
knowledge
and
had
it
published
in
the
form
of
a
book
we
had
a
copy
somewhere
we
were
along
the
gallery
and
our
cousin
was
in
full
blast
when
adèle
to
whom
he
was
introducing
the
portraits
with
triumphant
unction
started
forward
with
a
low
cry
that
the
very
man
she
exclaimed
pointing
at
the
picture
of
a
gentleman
in
a
coat
which
i
seemed
to
remember
was
unsigned
but
attributed
without
much
confidence
to
the
brush
of
gonzales
coques
what
an
extraordinary
thing
i
broken
my
dream
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
vandy
importance
was
snatched
from
him
and
the
prophet
mantle
had
fallen
upon
adèle
where
but
a
moment
before
he
had
been
strutting
in
all
the
pride
of
a
proprietor
she
held
the
stage
more
neither
our
discomfited
host
nor
his
sisters
could
divine
what
was
toward
and
the
fact
that
their
guests
crowded
eagerly
about
adèle
encouraging
her
to
let
them
have
it
was
more
disconcerting
than
ever
it
was
in
a
garden
said
adèle
a
quiet
sort
of
place
i
think
i
was
walking
behind
him
i
do
know
how
i
got
there
but
he
did
see
me
all
the
same
he
kept
looking
round
as
if
he
was
afraid
he
was
being
watched
presently
we
came
to
a
place
where
there
was
a
stone
pedestal
standing
it
was
exactly
a
pillar
it
was
high
enough
and
it
was
too
high
for
a
seat
well
he
stared
at
this
for
a
moment
then
he
looked
around
again
very
cautiously
and
then
it
sounds
idiotic
but
he
began
to
prod
the
turf
with
his
stick
at
first
he
did
it
just
casually
here
and
there
but
after
a
little
he
started
prodding
at
regular
intervals
methodically
the
ground
was
quite
soft
and
his
stick
seemed
to
go
in
like
a
skewer
suddenly
he
seemed
to
hear
something
or
somebody
for
he
listened
very
carefully
and
then
walked
on
tiptoe
to
the
pedestal
and
leaned
up
against
it
as
if
he
were
resting
the
next
moment
somebody
some
man
in
ordinary
clothes
came
out
of
she
hesitated
i
do
know
whether
it
was
some
bushes
or
a
wall
he
came
out
of
some
bushes
i
guess
any
way
he
appeared
and
do
laugh
gave
him
a
green
tomato
then
i
woke
up
and
this
is
the
man
you
saw
cried
daphne
pointing
adèle
nodded
dress
and
everything
he
was
wearing
the
same
plumed
hat
and
that
identical
coat
buttoned
all
down
the
front
with
the
pockets
low
down
on
either
side
and
i
never
forget
his
face
that
a
wonderful
picture
it
what
an
extraordinary
thing
said
i
then
i
turned
to
vandy
has
this
portrait
ever
been
reproduced
he
did
not
seem
to
hear
me
with
dropped
jaw
and
bulging
eyes
the
fellow
was
staring
at
adèle
staring
suddenly
as
with
an
effort
he
pulled
himself
together
was
that
all
you
saw
he
said
hoarsely
adèle
pondered
i
think
so
she
said
slowly
except
that
there
were
some
words
carved
on
the
pedestal
per
imp
perimp
no
that
was
it
something
like
that
not
english
i
ca
remember
ah
berry
took
up
the
running
you
say
the
merchant
was
prodding
the
ground
he
said
that
right
it
sounds
silly
but
not
at
all
said
berry
excitedly
he
was
looking
for
something
as
clear
as
daylight
he
turned
to
the
picture
that
william
pleydell
is
it
vandy
bloke
the
one
pepys
mentions
my
cousin
nodded
abstractedly
with
unseeing
eyes
he
was
staring
out
of
a
window
it
was
patent
that
adèle
recital
had
affected
him
strangely
berry
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
where
the
book
you
wrote
he
said
gently
that
may
throw
some
light
on
it
one
of
our
hostesses
turned
as
though
she
would
fetch
the
volume
it
went
to
be
rebound
yesterday
cried
vandy
in
a
strained
penetrating
voice
his
sister
stopped
and
stood
still
in
her
tracks
a
moment
later
she
had
turned
back
and
was
murmuring
a
confirmation
jonah
who
had
been
busy
with
a
pencil
and
the
back
of
an
envelope
limped
towards
us
from
one
of
the
windows
the
pedestal
was
a
sundial
he
said
vandy
looked
at
him
sharply
he
turned
to
adèle
per
imp
you
said
try
pereunt
et
imputantur
latin
hours
pass
and
are
charged
against
us
you
find
the
phrase
on
five
sundials
out
of
six
a
buzz
of
excited
applause
greeted
this
admirable
contribution
adèle
looked
at
the
written
words
you
are
clever
she
said
of
course
that
it
it
must
be
vandy
reception
of
jonah
discovery
convinced
me
that
it
had
already
occurred
to
him
he
applauded
theatrically
the
fellow
was
playing
a
part
feverishly
besides
i
did
not
believe
his
rotten
book
was
being
rebound
that
was
a
lie
there
was
something
there
which
he
did
not
want
us
to
see
not
a
doubt
of
it
well
we
had
a
copy
at
white
ladies
no
our
copy
was
in
town
hang
it
what
a
sweep
the
man
was
with
a
he
interrupted
my
reflections
well
well
miss
feste
i
confess
you
gave
me
a
shock
still
if
you
had
to
meet
one
of
our
forefathers
i
could
have
wished
it
had
been
any
other
than
the
notorious
william
we
enjoy
his
portrait
but
we
deplore
his
memory
ha
ha
now
we
really
proud
of
the
next
one
his
cousin
james
godstow
pleydell
he
it
was
who
was
responsible
forgive
me
purred
daphne
but
i
going
to
say
we
must
fly
i
no
idea
it
was
so
late
people
are
coming
to
dinner
and
we
must
go
back
by
brooch
because
we
run
out
of
ice
our
host
protested
not
very
heartily
and
was
overruled
mutual
regret
was
suitably
expressed
without
more
ado
we
descended
into
the
hall
here
at
the
front
door
the
decencies
of
were
observed
the
host
and
hostesses
were
thanked
the
parting
guests
sped
a
moment
later
we
were
sliding
down
the
avenue
to
the
as
we
swung
on
to
the
road
where
the
book
said
daphne
that
man
a
liar
at
cholmondeley
street
said
i
but
you
right
about
vandy
trying
to
keep
something
back
he
so
excited
he
does
know
what
to
do
said
daphne
clear
well
what
the
deuce
is
it
said
berry
i
read
the
blinkin
book
but
i
swear
there
nothing
in
it
about
buried
treasure
whatever
it
is
said
i
it
in
that
book
i
get
it
really
want
any
ice
daphne
shook
her
head
but
i
could
stay
there
with
that
man
another
minute
adèle
lifted
up
her
sweet
voice
i
feel
very
guilty
she
said
i
upset
you
all
i
given
everything
away
to
your
cousin
with
both
hands
and
i
nonsense
darling
said
daphne
you
did
the
natural
thing
how
could
you
know
jonah
interrupted
her
with
a
laugh
one
thing
certain
he
said
i
bet
old
vandy
cursing
the
day
he
rushed
into
print
upon
reflection
it
seemed
idle
for
any
one
of
us
to
journey
to
london
and
back
merely
to
fetch
a
volume
so
the
next
morning
one
of
the
servants
was
dispatched
instead
armed
with
a
note
to
the
housekeeper
at
cholmondeley
street
telling
her
exactly
where
the
book
would
be
found
the
man
returned
as
we
were
finishing
dinner
and
history
of
the
pleydell
was
brought
to
berry
while
we
sat
at
dessert
nuts
and
wine
went
by
the
board
as
my
cut
the
string
we
left
our
places
and
crowded
about
him
reference
to
the
index
bade
us
turn
to
page
as
the
leaves
flicked
we
waited
breathlessly
then
here
we
are
said
berry
pleydell
in
nicholas
died
to
be
succeeded
by
his
only
child
william
of
whom
little
is
known
this
is
perhaps
as
well
for
such
information
as
is
to
hand
regarding
his
life
and
habits
shows
him
to
have
been
addicted
to
no
ordinarily
evil
ways
the
lustre
which
his
father
and
grandfather
had
added
to
the
family
name
william
seems
to
have
spared
no
effort
to
tarnish
when
profligacy
was
so
fashionable
a
man
must
have
lived
hard
indeed
to
attract
attention
nevertheless
samuel
pepys
the
diarist
refers
to
him
more
than
once
each
time
commenting
upon
the
vileness
of
his
company
and
his
offensive
behaviour
upon
one
occasion
we
are
told
at
the
the
whole
audience
was
scandalized
by
a
drunken
frolic
in
which
william
pleydell
a
gentleman
of
hampshire
played
a
disgraceful
part
what
was
worse
he
carried
his
dissolute
habits
into
the
countryside
and
at
one
time
his
way
of
living
at
the
family
seat
white
ladies
was
so
openly
outrageous
that
the
incumbent
of
bilberry
actually
denounced
the
squire
from
the
pulpit
referring
to
him
as
notorious
and
abandoned
wretch
if
not
for
his
good
name
however
for
the
house
and
he
seems
to
have
had
some
respect
for
it
was
during
his
tenure
that
the
stables
were
rebuilt
and
the
gardens
decorated
with
statuary
which
has
since
disappeared
the
sensation
which
the
word
produced
was
profound
and
jill
cried
out
with
excitement
sundial
bearing
the
date
and
the
cipher
still
stands
in
the
garden
of
the
old
which
passed
out
of
the
hands
of
the
family
early
in
the
nineteenth
berry
stopped
reading
and
laid
the
book
down
the
cried
daphne
blankly
her
husband
nodded
but
i
never
knew
there
was
one
besides
better
known
as
lawn
bilberry
quite
right
said
jonah
a
hundred
years
ago
that
stood
inside
the
park
the
lawn
cried
jill
why
that
where
the
fire
was
years
and
years
ago
i
remember
old
nanny
taking
me
down
to
see
it
the
next
day
and
it
never
been
rebuilt
to
my
knowledge
said
i
it
had
a
board
up
saying
it
for
sale
for
the
last
fifteen
years
shall
we
go
in
for
it
they
ca
want
much
the
house
is
gutted
the
garden
a
wilderness
and
a
cry
from
adèle
interrupted
me
while
we
were
talking
she
had
picked
up
the
volume
listen
to
this
she
william
pleydell
died
unmarried
and
intestate
in
and
was
succeeded
by
his
cousin
anthony
except
that
during
the
former
tenure
a
good
deal
of
timber
was
cut
white
ladies
had
been
well
cared
for
the
one
blot
upon
his
stewardship
was
the
disappearance
of
the
greater
part
of
the
family
plate
which
nicholas
pleydell
will
proves
to
have
been
unusually
rare
and
valuable
used
to
exist
a
legend
for
which
the
author
can
trace
no
foundation
that
william
had
brought
it
from
london
during
the
great
plague
and
buried
it
for
want
of
a
at
white
a
far
more
probable
explanation
is
that
its
graceless
inheritor
surreptitiously
disposed
of
the
treasure
for
the
same
reason
as
he
committed
waste
to
spend
the
proceeds
upon
riotous
living
dumbly
we
stared
at
the
reader
the
murder
was
out
berry
whipped
out
his
watch
nine
he
announced
we
can
do
nothing
and
that
sweep
vandy
got
a
long
lead
we
have
a
moment
to
lose
who
are
the
agents
for
the
lawn
it
on
the
board
said
i
and
i
read
it
a
thousand
times
but
hanged
if
i
can
remember
whether
it
miller
of
brooch
or
a
london
firm
slip
over
there
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
said
jonah
if
miller
so
much
the
better
you
can
go
straight
on
to
brooch
if
it
a
london
man
well
there
always
the
telephone
i
hope
to
heaven
said
daphne
it
it
still
for
sale
vandy
got
scotch
blood
in
him
said
berry
he
wo
lay
out
fifteen
hundred
or
so
without
looking
round
more
like
three
thousand
said
jonah
it
a
lot
of
money
to
risk
said
daphne
slowly
yes
said
adèle
anxiously
i
feel
that
i
know
it
your
affair
but
if
it
had
been
for
my
dream
this
would
never
have
happened
and
supposing
there
nothing
in
it
i
mean
it
would
be
dreadful
to
think
you
thrown
away
all
that
money
and
gotten
nothing
in
exchange
and
they
always
say
that
dreams
are
contrary
let
face
the
facts
said
my
taking
everything
into
consideration
does
it
look
like
a
vision
or
second
sight
we
agreed
vociferously
only
adèle
looked
ill
at
ease
berry
continued
very
well
then
less
than
a
month
ago
all
our
silver
was
taken
off
us
by
comic
burglars
does
it
look
as
if
we
were
being
offered
the
chance
of
replacing
it
by
something
better
again
we
agreed
lastly
the
insurance
company
has
paid
up
to
the
tune
of
four
thousand
pounds
which
amount
is
now
standing
to
the
credit
of
my
deposit
account
at
coutts
i
tell
you
if
we
do
have
a
dart
we
shall
be
mad
i
agree
said
i
so
do
i
cried
jill
i
all
for
it
only
daphne
and
jonah
hesitated
i
laid
my
hand
upon
the
former
shoulder
supposing
i
said
we
take
no
action
but
vandy
does
supposing
he
strikes
oil
and
lands
the
stuff
under
our
noses
would
you
cheerfully
blow
the
four
thousand
just
to
avoid
that
my
sister
eyes
flashed
and
jonah
chin
went
up
anything
said
daphne
emphatically
anything
would
be
better
than
that
so
was
the
decision
made
we
adjourned
to
the
and
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
discussed
the
matter
furiously
the
suggestion
that
vandy
would
not
wait
to
buy
but
had
already
got
to
work
at
the
lawn
was
summarily
dismissed
our
cousin
was
too
cautious
for
that
he
knew
that
the
moment
we
had
the
book
we
should
be
as
wise
as
he
and
that
since
we
were
at
loggerheads
we
should
certainly
not
sit
quietly
by
and
permit
him
to
enrich
himself
to
our
teeth
when
a
word
to
the
owners
of
the
lawn
would
compel
him
to
disgorge
any
treasure
he
found
no
vandy
was
no
fool
he
would
walk
circumspectly
and
buy
first
and
dig
afterwards
it
was
jonah
who
raised
the
question
of
treasure
trove
in
some
uneasiness
we
sought
for
a
book
of
law
investigation
however
satisfied
us
that
if
the
plate
were
ever
unearthed
the
crown
would
not
interfere
evidence
that
an
ancestor
had
buried
it
was
available
and
reference
to
the
will
of
nicholas
would
establish
its
identity
whether
it
belonged
to
us
or
to
vandy
was
another
matter
but
reason
suggested
that
law
and
equity
alike
would
favour
the
party
in
whose
land
it
was
found
we
ordered
breakfast
early
and
the
car
at
a
quarter
to
nine
but
for
all
that
it
was
past
midnight
before
we
went
to
bed
the
next
morning
for
once
in
a
way
we
were
up
to
time
two
minutes
after
the
quarter
we
were
all
six
in
the
car
and
it
was
not
yet
nine
when
jonah
pulled
up
in
the
shade
of
a
mighty
oak
less
than
a
hundred
paces
from
the
tall
iron
gates
which
stood
gaunt
rusty
and
forbidding
to
mar
the
beauty
of
the
quiet
so
far
as
we
could
see
there
was
no
one
about
but
we
were
anxious
not
to
attract
attention
so
berry
and
i
alighted
and
strolled
casually
forward
the
object
of
our
visit
was
of
course
to
learn
from
the
board
in
whose
hands
the
property
had
been
placed
for
sale
but
we
had
decided
that
if
it
were
possible
we
must
effect
an
entrance
to
see
whether
the
turf
about
the
sundial
had
been
disturbed
moreover
if
we
could
get
adèle
inside
it
would
be
highly
interesting
to
see
whether
she
recognized
the
place
wired
on
to
the
mouldering
gates
a
board
glared
at
us
with
immediate
possession
to
be
sold
this
very
desirable
mansion
standing
in
three
acres
of
pleasure
grounds
and
only
requiring
certain
structural
repairs
to
be
made
an
ideal
modern
residence
miller
estate
agent
high
considering
that
the
house
had
been
gutted
nearly
twenty
years
ago
and
had
stood
as
the
fire
had
left
it
from
then
until
now
the
advertisement
was
euphemistic
by
dint
of
peering
between
the
corrupted
bars
it
was
possible
to
see
for
ourselves
the
desolation
a
press
of
nettles
crowded
about
the
scorched
and
blackened
walls
square
gaping
mouths
that
had
been
windows
showed
from
the
light
within
that
there
was
no
roof
while
here
and
there
charred
timbers
thrust
their
unsightly
way
from
out
of
a
riot
of
brambles
wild
and
disorderly
what
we
could
see
of
the
garden
was
a
very
wilderness
tall
rank
grass
flourished
on
every
side
and
borders
alike
had
been
blotted
into
a
springing
waste
and
the
few
sprawling
shrubs
which
we
could
recognize
hardly
emerged
from
beneath
the
choking
smother
of
luxuriant
bindweed
the
gates
were
chained
and
padlocked
but
they
were
not
difficult
to
scale
and
in
a
moment
berry
and
i
were
over
and
standing
in
the
long
wet
grass
stealthily
we
made
our
way
to
the
back
of
the
house
the
sundial
was
just
visible
the
grass
of
what
had
once
been
a
trim
lawn
rose
up
about
the
heavy
pedestal
coarse
and
tumultuous
but
it
was
untouched
no
foot
of
man
or
beast
had
trodden
it
lately
at
any
rate
simultaneously
we
heaved
sighs
of
relief
then
adèle
never
recognize
this
said
berry
it
hopeless
what
she
saw
was
a
lawn
not
a
prairie
i
nodded
still
he
went
on
there
used
to
be
a
door
in
the
wall
on
the
east
side
as
he
spoke
he
turned
and
looked
sharply
at
the
haggard
building
thought
i
heard
something
he
added
did
you
i
swung
on
my
heel
and
together
we
stared
and
listened
eyes
and
ears
alike
went
unrewarded
the
silence
of
desolation
hung
like
a
ragged
pall
gruesome
and
deathly
without
a
word
we
passed
to
the
east
of
the
ruin
after
a
little
we
came
to
the
door
in
the
wall
here
was
no
lock
and
with
a
little
patience
we
drew
the
bolts
and
pulled
the
door
open
it
gave
on
to
a
little
lane
which
ran
into
the
at
a
point
close
to
where
the
others
were
waiting
i
left
berry
and
hastened
back
to
the
car
exclamations
of
surprise
greeted
my
issuing
from
the
lane
and
i
could
read
the
same
unspoken
query
in
four
faces
at
once
we
first
in
the
field
so
far
i
said
there
was
a
gasp
of
relief
come
along
we
found
a
way
for
you
adèle
and
jill
were
already
out
of
the
car
daphne
and
jonah
made
haste
to
alight
think
we
can
leave
her
said
jonah
with
a
nod
at
the
rolls
oh
yes
we
sha
be
a
minute
hurriedly
we
padded
back
the
way
i
had
come
berry
was
still
at
the
door
and
in
silence
we
followed
him
to
where
he
and
i
had
stood
looking
and
listening
a
few
minutes
before
cried
jill
in
an
excited
whisper
what
about
it
adèle
said
berry
adèle
looked
about
her
knitting
her
brows
then
i
afraid
to
say
anything
she
said
it
may
be
the
place
i
sat
i
ca
say
it
is
but
it
so
altered
i
think
if
the
grass
was
cut
what
did
i
say
said
my
but
the
pedestal
was
exactly
that
height
that
i
swear
and
it
stood
on
a
step
what
did
the
words
look
like
said
i
they
were
carved
in
block
letters
on
the
side
of
the
cornice
as
carefully
as
i
could
i
stepped
to
the
sundial
as
i
came
up
to
it
my
foot
encountered
a
step
the
column
was
unusually
massive
and
the
dial
must
have
been
two
feet
square
lichened
and
an
inscription
upon
the
cornice
was
yet
quite
easy
to
read
pereunt
et
imputantur
and
the
words
were
carved
in
block
lettering
a
buzz
of
excitement
succeeded
my
report
then
daphne
turned
quickly
and
looked
searchingly
at
the
house
i
feel
as
if
we
were
being
watched
she
said
shuddering
let
get
back
to
the
car
as
jonah
followed
the
girls
into
the
lane
what
about
bolting
the
door
said
berry
shook
his
head
does
matter
he
said
any
way
we
trodden
the
grass
down
besides
there
nothing
to
hide
we
dragged
the
door
to
and
hastened
after
the
others
as
we
climbed
into
the
car
jonah
started
the
engine
what
are
the
orders
he
said
is
miller
the
agent
you
never
said
yes
said
i
we
better
go
straight
to
brooch
our
way
lay
past
the
main
entrance
of
the
lawn
as
we
approached
this
jonah
exclaimed
and
set
his
foot
on
the
brake
leaning
against
the
wall
was
a
bicycle
and
there
was
a
man
figure
busy
about
the
gates
he
appeared
to
be
climbing
over
as
we
came
up
alongside
he
looked
at
us
curiously
then
he
went
on
with
his
work
a
moment
later
he
slid
a
pair
of
pliers
into
his
pocket
and
wringing
the
board
clear
of
its
fastenings
lowered
it
to
the
ground
we
were
too
late
the
lawn
was
no
longer
for
sale
our
chagrin
may
be
imagined
more
easily
than
it
can
be
described
we
returned
to
white
ladies
in
a
state
of
profound
depression
alternately
cursing
vandy
and
upbraiding
ourselves
for
not
having
sent
for
the
book
upon
the
evening
of
the
day
of
our
visit
to
broken
ash
jonah
reproached
himself
bitterly
for
giving
our
cousin
the
benefit
of
his
detective
work
although
both
daphne
and
i
were
positive
that
vandy
had
identified
the
pedestal
from
adèle
description
before
jonah
had
volunteered
the
suggestion
that
it
was
a
sundial
as
for
adèle
she
was
inconsolable
it
was
after
lunch
a
miserable
meal
when
we
were
seated
upon
the
terrace
that
berry
cleared
his
throat
and
spoke
wisely
and
to
the
point
the
milk
spilt
he
said
and
that
that
so
we
may
as
well
dry
our
eyes
with
that
perishing
motto
staring
us
in
the
face
we
might
have
had
the
sense
to
be
a
bit
quicker
off
the
mark
but
it
always
the
obvious
that
you
never
see
vandy
beaten
us
by
a
foul
but
there
no
stewards
to
appeal
to
so
we
got
to
stick
it
all
the
same
got
some
digging
to
do
before
he
can
draw
the
money
and
i
ready
to
lay
a
monkey
that
he
does
it
himself
what
more
the
last
thing
want
is
to
be
disturbed
in
fact
any
interference
with
his
work
of
excavation
will
undoubtedly
shorten
his
life
properly
organized
innocent
interference
will
probably
affect
his
reason
our
course
of
action
is
therefore
clear
unable
to
procure
his
beastly
book
our
copy
can
not
be
found
we
have
forgotten
the
incident
it
comes
to
our
ears
that
he
has
bought
the
lawn
and
is
in
possession
what
more
natural
than
that
some
of
us
should
repair
thither
to
congratulate
him
upon
becoming
our
neighbour
we
shall
roll
up
quite
casually
by
way
of
the
door
in
the
wall
and
when
we
find
him
labouring
affect
the
utmost
surprise
of
our
good
nature
we
might
even
offer
to
help
him
to
er
relay
the
lawn
or
tackle
the
drains
or
whatever
he
doing
in
any
event
we
shall
enact
the
of
the
village
idiot
till
between
the
respective
gadflies
of
suspicion
which
he
dare
not
voice
and
impatience
which
he
dare
not
reveal
he
will
be
goaded
into
a
condition
of
frenzy
what
about
it
the
idea
was
heartily
approved
and
we
became
more
cheerful
immediate
arrangements
were
made
for
the
entrance
to
the
lawn
to
be
watched
for
the
next
hours
by
reliefs
of
servants
whom
we
could
trust
and
instructions
were
issued
that
the
moment
vandy
pleydell
put
in
an
appearance
whether
by
day
or
night
we
were
to
be
informed
at
eight
the
next
morning
berry
came
into
my
room
they
off
he
said
minutes
ago
vandy
and
emma
and
may
arrived
unaccompanied
in
a
dogcart
he
got
the
key
of
the
gates
but
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
open
appears
to
have
been
titanic
they
seem
to
have
stuck
or
something
altogether
according
to
james
a
most
distressing
scene
however
eventually
they
got
inside
and
managed
to
shut
the
gates
after
them
in
the
dogcart
there
was
a
scythe
and
a
whole
armoury
of
tools
i
got
out
of
bed
and
looked
at
him
after
breakfast
i
queried
my
nodded
i
think
so
we
settle
the
premises
as
we
go
as
we
were
approaching
the
lawn
i
looked
at
my
watch
it
was
just
a
quarter
to
ten
the
little
door
in
the
wall
was
still
unbolted
and
a
very
little
expenditure
of
energy
sufficed
to
admit
my
nobby
and
myself
into
the
garden
so
far
as
the
sealyham
was
concerned
wilderness
was
paradise
enow
tail
up
he
plunged
into
the
welter
of
grass
leaping
and
wallowing
and
panting
with
surprise
and
delight
at
a
playground
which
surpassed
his
wildest
dreams
for
a
moment
we
watched
him
amusedly
then
we
pushed
the
door
to
and
started
to
saunter
towards
the
house
it
was
a
glorious
day
right
at
the
end
of
august
out
of
a
flawless
sky
the
sun
blazed
broiling
and
merciless
there
was
nowhere
a
breath
of
wind
and
in
the
sheltered
garden
always
a
the
heat
was
stifling
as
we
drew
near
the
sound
of
voices
raised
in
bitterness
fell
upon
our
ears
and
we
rounded
the
corner
of
the
building
to
find
vandy
in
the
grass
about
the
sundial
shaking
a
sickle
at
his
sisters
who
were
seated
upon
carriage
cushions
which
had
been
laid
upon
the
flags
and
demanding
furiously
how
the
devil
they
expected
him
to
reap
with
a
sweeping
motion
when
the
lawn
was
full
of
molehills
quite
right
said
berry
it
ca
be
done
emma
and
may
screamed
and
vandy
jumped
as
if
he
had
been
shot
then
with
a
snarl
he
turned
to
face
us
crouching
a
little
like
a
beast
at
bay
before
he
could
utter
a
word
berry
was
off
advancing
with
an
air
of
engaging
frankness
which
would
have
beguiled
the
most
hardened
cynic
he
let
loose
upon
our
cousin
a
voluminous
flood
of
chatter
which
drowned
his
protests
ere
they
were
mouthed
overwhelmed
his
inquiries
ere
they
were
launched
and
finally
swept
him
off
his
feet
into
the
whirlpool
of
uncertainty
fear
and
bewilderment
before
he
knew
where
he
was
we
had
only
just
heard
of
his
purchase
were
delighted
to
think
we
were
to
be
neighbours
had
had
no
idea
he
was
contemplating
a
move
had
always
said
what
a
jolly
little
nook
it
was
never
could
understand
why
it
had
been
in
the
market
so
long
thought
we
might
find
him
here
taking
a
look
round
wanted
to
see
him
so
decided
to
kill
two
birds
with
one
stone
what
about
the
jolly
old
book
had
it
come
back
from
the
binders
we
could
find
ours
thought
it
must
be
in
town
the
girls
were
devilling
the
life
out
of
him
to
look
it
up
was
it
william
or
nicholas
he
thought
it
was
william
had
vandy
said
it
was
william
what
was
the
blinking
use
any
old
way
and
what
a
day
i
he
got
a
bet
with
jonah
that
the
thermometer
touched
before
noon
what
did
vandy
think
and
what
on
earth
was
he
doing
with
the
ploughshare
on
his
left
front
oh
a
scythe
of
course
he
put
it
down
it
made
him
tired
to
look
at
it
and
was
he
reclaiming
the
lawn
or
only
looking
for
a
of
course
what
he
really
wanted
was
a
a
and
a
gang
of
convicts
i
had
been
prepared
to
support
the
speaker
but
after
three
minutes
of
this
i
left
his
side
and
sat
down
on
the
flags
at
last
berry
paused
for
breath
and
emma
who
had
hurriedly
composed
and
been
rehearsing
a
plausible
appreciation
of
the
state
of
affairs
and
was
fidgeting
to
get
it
off
her
chest
thrust
her
way
into
the
gap
well
the
truth
was
they
were
going
to
take
up
french
gardening
there
was
no
room
at
broken
ash
and
besides
they
must
have
a
walled
garden
building
nowadays
was
such
a
frightful
expense
and
suddenly
thought
of
the
lawn
it
was
sheltered
just
the
right
size
not
too
far
away
and
all
they
had
to
do
was
to
clear
the
ground
and
vandy
was
so
impatient
that
nothing
would
satisfy
him
but
to
start
at
once
get
tired
of
it
in
a
day
or
two
she
added
artlessly
but
you
know
what
he
is
for
an
improvised
exposition
of
proceedings
so
extraordinary
i
thought
her
rendering
extremely
creditable
so
i
think
did
vandy
for
he
threw
an
approving
glance
in
her
direction
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
and
screwed
up
his
mouth
into
a
sickly
smile
took
up
gardening
during
the
war
he
announced
i
we
all
did
any
amount
of
money
in
it
quite
surprised
me
but
he
added
warming
to
his
work
it
the
same
with
gardening
as
with
everything
else
in
this
world
the
most
valuable
asset
is
the
personal
element
if
you
want
a
thing
well
done
do
it
yourself
ha
ha
my
looked
round
regarding
the
howling
riot
of
waste
and
where
he
said
shall
you
plant
the
asparagus
vandy
started
and
dropped
the
sickle
then
he
gave
a
forced
laugh
you
must
give
us
a
chance
he
said
we
got
a
long
way
to
go
before
we
get
to
that
all
this
he
waved
an
arm
and
his
voice
faltered
all
this
has
got
to
be
cleared
first
i
suppose
it
has
said
berry
well
do
mind
us
you
get
on
with
it
short
of
locusts
or
an
earthquake
it
going
to
be
a
long
job
i
suppose
you
could
hire
a
and
shell
it
for
a
couple
of
months
apparently
vandy
was
afraid
to
trust
his
voice
for
after
swallowing
twice
he
recovered
the
sickle
and
started
to
hack
savagely
at
the
grass
without
another
word
with
the
utmost
deliberation
berry
seated
himself
upon
the
flagstones
and
taking
out
his
case
selected
a
cigarette
with
an
equally
leisurely
air
i
produced
a
pipe
and
tobacco
and
began
to
make
ready
to
smoke
our
cousins
regarded
these
preparations
with
an
uneasiness
which
they
ill
concealed
clearly
we
were
not
proposing
to
move
the
silence
of
awkwardness
and
frantically
working
brains
settled
upon
the
company
from
time
to
time
emma
and
may
shifted
uncomfortably
as
he
bent
about
his
labour
vandy
eyes
bulged
more
than
ever
nobby
whom
i
had
forgotten
suddenly
reappeared
crawling
pleasedly
from
beneath
a
tangled
stack
of
foliage
of
which
the
core
appeared
to
have
been
a
rhododendron
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
us
as
if
surprised
at
the
company
we
kept
then
his
eyes
fell
upon
vandy
enshrined
in
the
swaying
grass
the
latter
knickerbockers
which
had
been
generously
fashioned
out
of
a
material
which
had
been
boldly
conceived
presented
a
back
view
which
was
most
arresting
with
his
head
on
one
side
the
terrier
gazed
at
them
with
such
inquisitive
astonishment
that
i
had
to
set
my
teeth
so
as
not
to
laugh
outright
his
cautious
advance
to
investigate
the
phenomenon
was
still
more
ludicrous
and
i
was
quite
relieved
when
our
cousin
straightened
his
back
and
dissipated
an
illusion
monstrously
worthy
of
the
pen
of
mandeville
but
there
was
better
to
come
as
the
unwitting
vandy
after
a
speechless
glance
in
our
direction
bent
again
to
his
work
nobby
cast
an
appraising
eye
over
the
area
which
had
already
received
attention
perceiving
a
molehill
which
had
suffered
an
ugly
gash
presumably
from
a
scythe
he
trotted
up
to
explore
and
clapping
his
nose
to
the
wound
snuffed
long
and
thoughtfully
the
next
moment
he
was
digging
like
one
possessed
emma
and
may
stiffened
with
a
shock
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
i
saw
them
exchange
glances
panic
fear
sat
in
their
eyes
their
fingers
moved
convulsively
then
with
one
consent
they
began
to
cough
their
unconscious
brother
worked
on
so
did
the
sealyham
but
with
a
difference
while
the
one
toiled
the
other
was
in
his
element
a
shower
of
earth
flew
from
between
his
legs
only
ceasing
for
a
short
moment
when
he
preferred
to
rend
the
earth
with
his
jaws
and
so
facilitate
the
excavation
the
coughing
became
insistent
frantic
impossible
to
be
disregarded
as
i
was
in
the
act
of
turning
to
express
my
concern
vandy
looked
up
followed
the
direction
of
four
starting
eyes
and
let
out
a
screech
of
dismay
what
on
earth
the
matter
cried
berry
getting
upon
his
feet
been
stung
or
something
with
a
trembling
forefinger
vandy
indicated
the
miscreant
stop
him
he
yelled
call
him
off
spoil
the
lawn
ruin
it
shrilled
emma
where
said
berry
blankly
what
lawn
lawn
roared
vandy
stamping
his
foot
but
i
thought
i
do
care
what
you
thought
call
the
brute
off
it
my
land
and
i
wo
have
it
nobby
said
berry
come
off
the
bowling
green
scrambling
to
my
feet
i
countersigned
the
order
in
a
peremptory
tone
aggrievedly
the
terrier
complied
my
turned
to
vandy
with
an
injured
air
i
fear
he
said
stiffly
that
we
are
unwelcome
instinctively
emma
and
may
made
as
though
they
would
protest
in
some
dignity
berry
lifted
his
hand
i
may
be
wrong
he
said
i
hope
so
but
from
the
first
i
felt
that
your
manner
was
strained
subsequent
events
suggest
that
my
belief
was
well
founded
he
turned
to
vandy
may
i
ask
you
to
let
us
out
i
am
reluctant
to
trouble
you
but
to
scale
those
gates
twice
in
one
morning
is
rather
more
than
i
care
about
fearful
lest
our
surprise
at
our
reception
should
become
crystallized
into
an
undesirable
suspicion
short
of
pressing
us
to
remain
our
cousins
did
everything
to
smooth
our
ruffled
plumage
vandy
threw
down
the
sickle
and
advanced
with
an
apologetic
leer
emma
and
may
wreathed
in
smiles
protested
nervously
that
they
had
known
the
work
was
too
much
for
vandy
and
begged
us
to
think
no
more
of
it
as
we
followed
the
latter
round
to
the
quondam
drive
they
waved
a
cordial
farewell
the
sight
of
the
dogcart
standing
with
upturned
shafts
a
pickaxe
three
shovels
a
rake
two
forks
a
number
of
sacks
and
a
sieve
piled
anyhow
by
its
side
was
most
engaging
but
after
bestowing
a
casual
glance
upon
the
paraphernalia
berry
passed
by
without
a
word
vandy
went
a
rich
plum
colour
hesitated
and
then
plunged
on
desperately
tethered
by
a
halter
to
a
tree
a
partially
harnessed
bay
mare
suspended
the
process
of
mastication
to
fix
us
with
a
suspicious
stare
her
also
we
passed
in
silence
after
a
blasphemous
struggle
with
the
gates
whose
objection
to
opening
was
literally
rooted
and
based
upon
custom
our
host
succeeded
in
forcing
them
apart
sufficiently
to
permit
our
egress
and
we
gave
him
good
day
in
silence
we
strolled
down
the
road
when
we
came
to
the
lane
berry
stopped
dead
brother
he
said
i
perceive
it
to
be
my
distasteful
duty
to
return
there
is
an
omission
which
i
must
repair
you
not
serious
said
i
the
fellow
murder
you
no
he
wo
said
berry
he
probably
burst
a
and
with
luck
he
may
even
have
a
stroke
but
he
wo
murder
me
you
see
and
with
that
he
turned
down
the
lane
towards
the
door
in
the
wall
nobby
and
i
followed
a
moment
later
we
were
once
more
in
the
garden
the
scene
upon
which
we
came
was
big
with
promise
staggering
over
the
frantic
employment
of
a
pickaxe
vandy
was
inflicting
grievous
injury
upon
the
turf
about
the
very
spot
at
which
the
terrier
had
been
digging
standing
well
out
of
range
his
sisters
were
regarding
the
exhibition
with
clasped
hands
and
looks
of
mingled
excitement
and
apprehension
all
three
were
so
much
engrossed
that
until
berry
spoke
they
were
not
aware
of
our
presence
i
so
sorry
to
interrupt
you
again
emma
and
may
screamed
and
vandy
endeavoured
to
check
his
implement
in
and
only
preserved
his
balance
and
a
whole
skin
as
by
a
miracle
but
you
know
i
quite
forgot
to
ask
you
about
the
book
and
as
that
was
really
our
main
object
in
the
roar
of
a
wild
beast
cut
short
the
speaker
bellowing
incoherently
trembling
with
passion
his
mouth
working
his
countenance
distorted
with
rage
vandy
shook
his
fist
at
his
tormentor
in
a
fit
of
ungovernable
fury
get
out
of
it
he
yelled
get
out
of
it
i
wo
have
this
intrusion
it
monstrous
i
wo
stand
it
i
tell
you
hush
vandy
hush
implored
his
sisters
in
agonized
tones
berry
raised
his
eyebrows
really
he
said
slowly
anybody
would
think
that
you
had
something
to
hide
then
he
turned
on
his
heel
i
was
about
to
follow
his
example
when
my
cousin
bloodshot
eye
perceived
that
nobby
was
once
more
innocently
investigating
the
scene
of
his
labour
with
a
choking
cry
our
host
sprang
forward
and
raised
the
pick
unaware
of
his
peril
the
dog
snuffed
on
one
of
the
women
screamed
desperately
i
flung
myself
forward
the
pick
was
falling
as
i
struck
it
aside
viciously
it
jabbed
its
way
into
the
earth
for
a
long
time
vandy
and
i
faced
one
another
breathing
heavily
i
watched
the
blood
fading
out
of
the
fellow
cheeks
at
length
be
thankful
said
i
that
i
was
in
time
otherwise
i
hesitated
and
vandy
took
a
step
backwards
and
put
a
hand
to
his
throat
exactly
i
said
then
i
plucked
the
pick
from
the
ground
stepped
a
few
paces
apart
and
taking
the
implement
with
both
hands
spun
round
and
threw
it
from
me
as
if
it
had
been
a
hammer
it
sailed
over
some
lime
trees
and
crashed
out
of
sight
into
some
foliage
then
i
called
the
terrier
and
strode
past
my
in
the
direction
of
the
postern
berry
fell
in
behind
and
followed
me
without
a
word
but
why
said
i
should
you
tell
me
the
day
of
your
birth
i
not
asking
the
year
said
adèle
i
sighed
why
she
inquired
do
you
want
to
know
so
that
i
can
observe
the
festival
as
it
deserves
spend
the
day
at
margate
or
go
to
a
cinema
or
something
i
might
even
wear
a
false
nose
you
never
know
it
an
important
date
in
my
calendar
how
many
people
have
you
said
that
to
i
laughed
bitterly
if
i
told
you
the
truth
i
said
you
would
believe
me
there
was
a
museful
silence
it
was
three
days
and
more
since
berry
and
i
had
visited
the
lawn
and
vandy
and
were
still
at
work
so
much
had
been
reported
by
an
for
ourselves
we
had
finished
with
our
cousins
for
good
and
all
the
brutal
attack
upon
our
favourite
was
something
we
could
not
forget
and
for
a
man
whom
beastly
rage
could
so
much
degrade
we
had
no
use
naturally
enough
his
sisters
went
with
him
orders
were
given
to
the
servants
that
to
callers
from
broken
ash
daphne
was
not
at
home
and
we
were
one
and
all
determined
so
far
as
was
possible
never
to
see
or
communicate
with
vandy
or
his
sisters
again
it
was
natural
however
that
we
should
be
deeply
interested
in
the
success
or
failure
of
his
venture
we
prayed
fervently
but
without
much
hope
that
it
might
fail
after
all
it
was
always
on
the
cards
that
another
had
stumbled
long
since
upon
the
treasure
or
that
a
thief
had
watched
its
burial
and
later
come
privily
and
unearthed
it
we
should
see
i
wonder
you
are
ashamed
of
yourself
said
miss
feste
at
your
age
you
ought
to
have
sown
all
your
wild
oats
so
i
have
i
said
stoutly
and
they
were
at
all
wild
either
never
seen
such
a
miserable
crop
as
soon
as
the
sun
rose
they
all
withered
away
the
sun
i
turned
and
looked
at
her
the
steady
brown
eyes
held
mine
with
a
searching
look
i
met
it
faithfully
after
a
few
seconds
they
turned
away
the
sun
she
repeated
quietly
the
sun
adèle
the
sun
that
rose
in
america
in
out
of
the
foam
of
the
sea
i
ca
tell
you
the
date
but
it
must
have
been
a
beautiful
day
there
was
a
pause
then
how
interesting
said
adèle
so
it
withered
them
up
did
it
i
nodded
you
see
adèle
they
had
no
root
none
of
them
none
adèle
looked
straight
ahead
of
her
into
the
which
rose
stiff
and
punctilious
ten
paces
away
the
counterpart
of
that
beneath
which
we
were
sitting
for
once
in
a
way
her
merry
smile
was
missing
in
its
stead
gravity
sat
in
her
eyes
hung
on
the
warm
red
lips
i
had
known
her
solemn
before
but
not
like
this
the
proud
face
looked
very
resolute
there
was
a
strength
about
the
lift
of
the
delicate
chin
a
steadfast
fearlessness
about
the
poise
of
the
head
unworldly
wonders
which
i
had
never
seen
over
the
glorious
temples
the
soft
dark
hair
swept
rich
and
lustrous
the
exquisite
column
of
her
neck
rose
from
her
flowered
silk
gown
with
matchless
elegance
her
precious
hands
all
rosy
lay
in
her
lap
crossed
legs
gave
me
twelve
inches
of
slim
silk
stocking
and
a
satin
slipper
dainty
habiliments
not
half
so
dainty
as
their
slender
charge
the
stable
clock
struck
the
six
people
had
been
to
tea
and
we
were
resting
after
our
labours
it
was
the
perfect
evening
of
a
true
summer
day
nobby
appeared
in
the
foreground
strolling
unconcernedly
over
the
turf
and
pausing
now
and
again
to
snuff
the
air
or
follow
up
an
odd
clue
of
scent
that
led
him
a
foot
or
so
before
it
died
away
and
came
to
nothing
how
said
adèle
slowly
did
you
come
by
nobby
painfully
distinct
the
wraith
of
josephine
childe
rose
up
before
me
pale
and
accusing
fragments
of
the
letter
which
had
offered
me
the
sealyham
themselves
upon
my
brain
nearly
breaks
my
heart
to
say
so
but
i
got
to
part
with
nobby
i
think
you
get
on
together
if
you
like
to
have
and
there
was
nothing
in
it
it
was
a
case
of
smoke
without
fire
but
i
could
have
spared
the
question
just
then
desperately
i
related
the
truth
a
girl
called
josephine
childe
gave
him
to
me
she
wanted
to
find
a
home
for
him
as
she
was
going
overseas
oh
the
silence
that
followed
this
remark
was
most
discomfiting
i
had
a
feeling
that
the
moments
were
critical
and
they
were
slipping
away
should
i
leap
into
the
tide
of
explanation
that
way
perhaps
lay
safety
always
the
quicksand
of
made
me
draw
back
i
became
extremely
nervous
feverishly
i
tried
to
think
of
a
remark
which
would
be
natural
and
more
or
less
relevant
and
would
pilot
us
into
a
channel
of
conversation
down
which
we
could
swim
with
confidence
of
all
the
legion
of
topics
the
clemency
of
the
weather
alone
occurred
to
me
i
could
have
screamed
the
firebrand
itself
came
to
my
rescue
tired
of
amusing
himself
the
terrier
retrieved
an
old
ball
from
beneath
the
hedge
and
trotting
across
the
sward
laid
it
down
at
my
feet
gratefully
i
picked
it
up
and
flung
it
for
him
to
fetch
it
fell
into
a
thick
welter
of
ivy
which
time
had
built
into
a
bulging
buttress
of
greenery
against
the
old
grey
wall
at
the
end
of
the
walk
the
dog
sped
after
it
his
short
legs
flying
the
spell
was
broken
and
i
felt
better
you
must
think
he
a
root
though
i
said
cheerfully
because
he
is
when
did
you
say
your
birthday
was
i
did
said
adèle
still
if
you
must
know
i
was
born
on
august
the
thirtieth
oh
adèle
and
i
nothing
for
you
except
i
hesitated
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
very
fast
but
i
be
ashamed
i
mean
my
voice
petered
out
helplessly
i
braced
myself
for
a
supreme
effort
an
impatient
yelp
rang
out
what
the
matter
with
nobby
said
adèle
in
a
voice
i
hardly
recognized
fed
up
i
lost
his
ball
for
him
said
i
and
cowardly
glad
of
a
respite
i
rose
and
stepped
to
the
aged
riot
of
ivy
where
the
terrier
was
searching
for
his
toy
i
pulled
a
hole
in
the
arras
and
peered
through
there
was
more
space
than
i
had
expected
the
grey
wall
bellied
away
from
me
what
that
said
adèle
looking
over
my
shoulder
what
said
i
there
to
the
right
it
was
dark
under
the
ivy
so
i
thrust
in
a
groping
arm
almost
at
once
my
hand
encountered
the
smooth
edge
of
masonry
i
took
out
a
knife
and
ripped
away
some
trails
so
that
we
could
see
better
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
the
pedestal
which
my
efforts
revealed
had
ever
supported
a
statue
but
it
was
plain
that
such
was
the
office
for
which
it
had
been
set
up
presumably
it
was
one
of
the
series
which
according
to
vandy
book
had
displayed
imaginative
effigies
of
the
roman
emperors
and
had
been
done
away
in
the
inscription
upon
the
cornice
upheld
this
conclusion
pertinax
imperator
i
looked
at
adèle
per
imp
said
i
does
the
cap
fit
yes
she
said
simply
that
right
i
remember
it
perfectly
the
other
seemed
likely
but
i
was
never
quite
sure
trembling
a
little
she
turned
and
looked
round
and
you
came
out
of
that
break
in
the
hedge
with
the
tomato
and
oh
she
stopped
and
the
colour
came
flooding
into
her
cheeks
then
in
a
flash
she
turned
and
sped
down
the
alley
like
a
wild
thing
as
in
a
dream
i
watched
the
tall
slim
figure
dart
out
of
sight
a
second
impatient
yelp
reminded
me
that
nobby
was
still
waiting
the
firm
of
silversmiths
whom
we
employed
to
clean
the
collection
after
it
had
been
disinterred
valued
it
for
purposes
of
insurance
at
thousand
pounds
we
saw
no
reason
to
communicate
with
vandy
the
exercise
was
probably
doing
him
good
and
he
had
shown
a
marked
antipathy
to
interruption
a
tent
had
been
pitched
at
the
lawn
and
the
work
of
excavation
went
steadily
on
not
until
the
of
september
did
it
suddenly
cease
three
days
later
we
had
occasion
to
drive
into
brooch
we
returned
by
way
of
the
lawn
as
we
approached
the
entrance
i
slowed
up
from
the
tall
gates
a
board
flaunted
its
black
and
white
paint
but
the
legend
it
bore
was
the
same
miller
was
evidently
a
conservative
chapter
xi
how
nobby
met
blue
bandala
and
adèle
gave
jonah
a
kiss
listen
to
this
said
berry
before
six
this
evening
an
extremely
valuable
chow
by
name
blue
bandala
which
i
purchased
last
march
for
no
less
a
sum
than
six
hundred
pounds
was
brutally
attacked
in
bilberry
village
by
a
mongrel
which
was
accompanying
two
girls
i
am
given
to
understand
that
this
animal
belongs
to
you
i
was
at
first
determined
to
issue
a
summons
but
i
have
now
decided
to
give
you
a
chance
before
doing
so
if
it
amuses
you
to
keep
such
a
cur
about
your
house
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
you
from
so
doing
but
you
must
understand
that
once
it
leaves
your
property
it
must
be
under
proper
and
effective
control
and
if
it
ever
attacks
a
dog
of
mine
again
i
shall
either
destroy
it
upon
the
spot
or
apply
to
the
bench
for
its
destruction
i
may
say
that
blue
bandala
is
not
only
very
well
bred
but
a
very
quiet
and
friendly
dog
and
was
in
no
way
to
blame
for
what
pleydell
white
the
explosion
which
the
reading
of
this
letter
provoked
is
indescribable
it
a
lie
cried
jill
in
a
choking
voice
it
a
beastly
lie
his
dog
started
it
nobby
would
never
have
touched
him
he
was
paying
any
attention
the
chow
came
up
from
behind
and
just
fell
upon
him
and
how
dare
he
say
he
a
mongrel
it
just
one
lie
after
another
is
it
adèle
it
outrageous
said
miss
feste
directly
i
saw
the
other
dog
i
thought
he
meant
mischief
but
before
i
could
tell
jill
he
started
in
nobby
did
even
know
he
was
there
the
door
opened
and
dinner
was
announced
falcon
said
berry
sir
said
the
butler
who
brought
this
note
it
was
a
chauffeur
sir
i
do
know
by
sight
sir
we
filed
out
of
the
library
smouldering
with
resentment
but
what
an
awful
man
he
must
be
said
daphne
even
if
our
dog
had
been
in
the
wrong
that
no
reason
for
writing
a
letter
like
that
it
unpardonable
said
i
it
quite
bad
enough
to
have
him
living
in
the
neighbourhood
but
if
this
is
the
way
he
going
to
behave
i
turned
to
adèle
was
his
manner
very
bad
at
the
time
he
seemed
more
rattled
than
anything
else
he
was
clearly
afraid
to
interfere
jill
and
i
got
them
apart
as
i
told
you
he
got
very
red
in
the
face
but
beyond
muttering
with
his
teeth
clenched
he
never
said
a
word
must
have
gone
straight
home
and
got
it
off
his
chest
said
jonah
i
expect
he
awfully
proud
of
that
letter
if
the
truth
were
known
well
do
let
dwell
on
it
said
berry
regarding
the
oysters
which
had
been
set
before
him
after
dinner
will
do
you
hardly
ever
go
down
with
typhoid
within
six
hours
he
turned
to
adèle
bet
you
i
got
more
strepsicocci
than
you
have
he
added
pleasantly
shut
up
said
daphne
adèle
dear
like
oysters
because
you
eat
them
if
you
do
no
do
said
berry
if
you
do
whatever
you
do
do
and
whatever
you
do
i
will
adèle
looked
at
him
with
a
mischievous
smile
i
could
bear
she
said
to
have
your
blood
on
my
head
then
she
glanced
gratefully
at
daphne
and
picked
up
a
fork
herbert
bason
had
arisen
out
of
the
cloud
of
war
the
time
had
produced
the
man
the
storm
had
burst
just
in
the
nick
of
time
to
save
the
drooping
theatrical
interests
which
he
controlled
and
the
fruit
which
these
had
borne
steadily
for
the
best
part
of
five
long
years
had
been
truly
phenomenal
a
patriot
to
the
backbone
the
bewildered
proprietor
obtained
absolute
exemption
from
the
tribunal
turned
the
first
six
rows
of
all
his
pits
into
stalls
and
bought
war
loan
with
both
hands
it
was
after
the
second
upon
london
that
he
decided
to
take
a
house
in
the
country
less
than
a
year
ago
he
had
disposed
of
his
and
had
settled
near
bilberry
for
good
by
the
way
said
daphne
did
i
tell
you
the
laundry
struck
thank
you
said
her
husband
for
that
phrase
do
mention
it
said
my
sister
but
i
thought
you
like
to
know
heaven
knows
when
they
go
back
so
i
should
go
easy
with
your
stiff
collars
and
shirts
what
have
the
saws
stopped
working
said
berry
i
ca
bear
it
what
about
my
trousers
said
i
i
only
one
clean
pair
left
daphne
shrugged
her
white
shoulders
what
about
my
tablecloths
she
replied
berry
addressed
himself
to
adèle
we
live
in
pleasant
times
do
not
we
almost
a
golden
age
i
wonder
what
the
trouble
is
now
probably
some
has
gone
and
ironed
twenty
socks
in
ten
minutes
instead
of
ten
socks
in
twenty
minutes
without
thinking
and
the
management
refuse
to
sack
her
for
this
grievous
lapse
into
the
slough
of
industry
out
of
which
a
provident
trade
union
has
blackmailed
her
to
climb
i
no
doubt
you
right
said
i
the
question
is
where
are
we
going
to
end
it
the
same
everywhere
and
the
mere
thought
of
income
tax
sends
my
temperature
up
ah
said
berry
i
had
a
quiet
hour
with
the
book
of
the
words
issued
by
that
fun
palace
somerset
house
this
afternoon
tax
and
how
to
pay
commonly
styled
with
unconscious
humour
the
income
tax
return
by
the
time
i
was
through
i
had
made
out
that
if
i
render
a
statement
according
to
the
printed
instructions
my
tax
will
exceed
my
income
by
one
hundred
and
pounds
if
on
the
other
hand
i
make
an
incorrect
return
i
shall
be
fined
fifty
pounds
and
treble
the
tax
payable
you
really
do
get
a
look
in
if
you
say
much
more
groaned
jonah
you
spoil
my
appetite
when
i
reflect
that
in
and
a
burst
of
piety
i
sent
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
a
postal
order
for
eight
and
sixpence
by
way
of
conscience
money
i
feel
positively
sick
not
piety
corrected
my
drink
i
remember
you
had
some
very
bad
goes
about
then
what
a
terrible
memory
you
have
said
adèle
i
feel
quite
uneasy
fear
not
sweet
one
was
the
reply
before
i
retail
your
indiscretions
i
shall
send
you
a
list
of
them
with
the
price
of
omission
clearly
marked
against
each
in
red
ink
the
writing
will
be
all
blurred
with
my
tears
here
adèle
declined
a
second
vegetable
there
now
i
gone
and
frightened
you
and
marrow
wonderful
for
the
spine
affords
instant
relief
and
you
need
eat
the
seeds
spit
them
over
your
left
shoulder
that
bring
you
luck
there
was
an
outraged
clamour
of
feminine
protest
i
wo
have
it
said
daphne
disgusting
brute
and
that
said
jonah
is
the
sodden
mountebank
who
dares
to
cast
a
stone
into
the
limpid
pool
of
my
character
that
is
the
overfed
sluggard
take
this
down
somebody
said
berry
the
words
scorch
up
the
paper
but
never
mind
record
the
blasphemy
capital
for
with
an
and
i
not
overfed
you
getting
fatter
every
day
said
jill
gurgling
that
right
said
my
bay
the
old
lion
and
bring
down
these
grey
hairs
in
talking
of
mountebanks
said
i
who
going
to
fallow
hill
fair
adèle
ought
to
see
it
said
daphne
why
do
you
run
her
over
in
the
car
i
will
if
she
like
to
go
it
a
real
bit
of
old
england
i
agree
said
berry
what
with
the
shies
and
the
steam
roundabouts
you
think
you
were
back
in
the
middle
ages
i
think
come
too
then
you
go
alone
said
i
i
do
forget
the
last
time
you
went
what
happened
said
adèle
her
eyes
lighted
with
expectation
berry
sighed
it
was
most
unfortunate
he
said
you
see
it
was
like
this
a
there
was
a
with
a
lot
of
at
which
you
were
to
throw
if
you
three
this
nervous
alliteration
interposed
adèle
is
more
than
i
can
you
received
a
guerdon
which
you
were
encouraged
to
select
from
a
revolting
collection
of
which
was
displayed
in
all
its
glory
upon
an
adjacent
stall
laden
with
munitions
i
advanced
to
the
rails
unhappily
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
i
mistook
my
objective
it
was
a
most
natural
error
both
were
arranged
in
tiers
both
were
pleading
for
destruction
nonsense
said
daphne
you
did
it
on
purpose
you
know
you
did
i
never
saw
anything
more
deliberate
in
all
my
life
not
at
all
replied
her
husband
i
was
confused
a
large
and
critical
crowd
had
collected
to
watch
my
prowess
and
i
was
pardonably
nervous
but
what
happened
said
adèle
well
said
i
naturally
nobody
was
expecting
such
a
move
with
the
result
that
the
brute
got
off
about
six
balls
before
they
could
stop
him
the
execution
among
the
prizes
was
too
awful
you
see
they
were
only
about
six
feet
away
the
owner
excepted
the
assembled
populace
thought
it
was
the
funniest
thing
they
ever
seen
yes
chimed
in
jill
and
then
he
turned
round
and
asked
the
man
how
many
bottles
he
won
i
never
was
so
ashamed
said
daphne
of
course
the
poor
man
was
nearly
off
his
head
and
i
paid
for
the
damage
said
jonah
i
looked
across
at
adèle
so
if
he
comes
with
us
i
said
you
know
what
to
expect
my
lady
threw
back
her
head
and
laughed
i
suppose
you
to
be
trusted
she
said
once
past
the
pub
said
berry
he
be
all
right
but
if
he
says
he
feels
faint
outside
the
do
argue
with
him
but
come
straight
home
at
any
rate
said
adèle
i
shall
have
nobby
the
reference
brought
us
back
to
bason
with
a
rush
in
spite
of
our
resolution
to
eschew
the
subject
that
letter
was
heatedly
discussed
for
the
remainder
of
dinner
was
the
third
of
september
and
on
the
eleventh
a
was
to
be
held
at
brooch
i
had
not
entered
nobby
because
i
felt
that
his
exhibition
would
probably
cause
us
more
trouble
than
the
proceeding
was
worth
it
now
occurred
to
us
that
bason
would
almost
certainly
enter
had
probably
long
ago
entered
his
precious
chow
any
local
triumph
however
petty
and
easy
for
a
man
of
means
to
procure
would
be
sure
to
appeal
to
one
of
his
calibre
and
the
chance
which
the
show
would
afford
of
encountering
if
not
accosting
one
or
two
county
people
would
be
greatly
to
his
relish
supposing
we
did
enter
nobby
the
idea
of
beating
bason
in
the
race
for
first
prize
with
the
mongrel
which
it
amused
us
to
keep
about
our
house
was
most
appealing
as
soon
as
dinner
was
over
berry
rang
up
the
secretary
our
surmise
was
correct
blue
bandala
was
entered
well
am
i
too
late
to
enter
a
sealyham
not
if
you
do
it
came
the
reply
you
shall
have
the
particulars
before
berry
replaced
the
receiver
little
herbert
will
take
the
first
prize
for
chows
he
said
that
ca
be
helped
but
he
entered
his
dog
for
the
comers
and
that
our
chance
if
we
ca
lift
that
goblet
from
under
his
ugly
nose
i
never
smile
again
what
exactly
comers
said
jill
the
best
specimen
of
any
breed
manners
carriage
everything
taken
into
consideration
if
personality
counts
said
jonah
nobby
romp
home
i
regarded
our
unconscious
representative
with
an
appraising
eye
supine
upon
the
sofa
with
his
head
out
of
sight
behind
adèle
there
was
little
to
recommend
him
as
a
model
of
deportment
with
a
sigh
i
resumed
the
composition
of
a
reply
to
bason
remarkable
letter
when
i
had
finished
the
draft
i
gave
it
to
berry
the
latter
read
it
through
nodding
solemn
approval
then
he
repaired
to
the
and
copied
my
sentences
word
for
word
on
to
a
sheet
of
notepaper
as
he
laid
down
his
pen
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
tell
you
what
he
said
if
the
blighter
replies
and
nobby
comes
off
at
the
show
we
send
this
correspondence
to
the
local
press
let
have
it
said
jonah
berry
handed
me
the
letter
and
i
read
it
aloud
have
received
your
an
alloy
of
misrepresentation
of
fact
arrogant
bluster
and
idle
menaces
i
doubt
whether
it
has
ever
been
equalled
upon
this
side
of
the
its
legibility
would
appear
to
be
its
only
that
i
care
for
your
style
of
handwriting
but
in
these
degenerate
days
it
is
you
will
agree
a
relief
to
receive
a
letter
which
can
be
easily
did
go
a
bust
on
blue
banana
did
you
act
upon
your
first
impulse
and
apply
for
a
summons
the
bench
will
not
grant
your
application
but
again
you
will
agree
it
is
the
effort
and
not
the
result
which
is
nice
of
you
to
inquire
after
my
sealyham
he
is
none
the
worse
thanks
and
i
fancy
he
made
old
blue
banana
sit
faithfully
bason
you
must
forgive
me
for
addressing
you
as
esquire
but
it
is
difficult
to
break
a
foolish
habit
of
courtesy
which
i
formed
as
a
child
fifteen
thirty
cried
adèle
making
ready
to
serve
hullo
she
pointed
with
her
racket
over
my
shoulder
nobby
gone
lame
i
swung
on
my
heel
to
see
the
terrier
limping
apologetically
towards
me
and
going
dead
lame
upon
the
near
fore
as
he
came
up
i
dropped
my
racket
and
fell
upon
one
knee
the
better
to
search
for
the
cause
of
the
trouble
carefully
i
handled
the
affected
limb
my
fingers
came
to
his
toes
and
the
sealyham
winced
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
laid
him
upon
his
back
got
it
said
adèle
i
looked
up
into
the
beautiful
face
three
inches
from
mine
i
fancy
so
i
bent
to
peer
at
the
small
firm
foot
yes
here
we
are
he
picked
up
a
puncture
the
next
moment
i
plucked
a
substantial
thorn
from
between
two
strong
black
toes
a
warm
red
tongue
touched
my
restraining
fingers
in
obvious
gratitude
will
he
be
all
right
anxiously
he
shall
speak
for
himself
said
i
releasing
my
patient
with
a
galvanic
squirm
the
latter
regained
his
feet
spun
into
the
air
gyrated
till
i
felt
dizzy
and
then
streaked
round
the
his
hind
feet
comically
overreaching
his
fore
steering
a
zigzag
course
with
such
inconsequence
as
suggested
that
my
lord
of
misrule
himself
was
directing
him
by
wireless
it
was
not
worth
while
finishing
our
interrupted
game
so
we
strolled
back
to
the
house
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
we
parted
to
go
and
change
directly
after
lunch
we
were
to
leave
for
the
fair
six
days
had
elapsed
since
nobby
scuffle
with
the
apple
of
eye
life
had
slipped
by
uneventfully
the
sealyham
had
been
put
upon
a
strict
diet
and
was
thoroughly
groomed
three
times
a
day
my
store
of
clean
starched
linen
had
dwindled
to
one
shirt
and
two
collars
which
distrusting
my
i
kept
under
lock
and
key
and
bason
had
been
stung
by
our
letter
into
sending
a
reply
which
afforded
us
the
maximum
of
gratification
it
ran
as
follows
insulting
letter
to
stand
by
every
word
of
my
previous
sooner
therefore
that
you
realize
that
i
am
not
to
be
trifled
with
the
better
for
all
are
evidently
one
of
those
people
who
believe
that
impudent
bluff
will
carry
them
anywhere
and
that
with
your
birth
and
upbringing
behind
you
you
can
do
as
you
please
but
you
are
wrong
among
men
who
are
men
as
distinct
from
pedantic
popinjays
you
go
for
nothing
bason
pleydell
be
good
enough
to
note
that
my
dog
name
is
blue
bandala
not
blue
banana
our
reply
was
dispatched
within
hours
thanks
for
your
masterly
appreciation
of
my
all
think
pedantic
popinjays
simply
splendid
is
it
your
own
tell
old
banana
skin
but
i
had
the
nerve
to
enter
my
sealyham
for
the
all
comers
event
at
glad
you
not
to
be
trifled
with
faithfully
pleydell
bason
in
two
days
time
we
should
meet
at
philippi
it
must
be
confessed
that
there
were
moments
when
we
remembered
our
precipitancy
in
some
uneasiness
nobby
was
well
bred
but
he
had
not
cost
six
hundred
pounds
always
he
looked
his
best
and
his
best
was
extremely
good
his
many
excellent
points
were
set
off
by
a
most
attractive
air
and
a
singular
charm
and
sprightliness
of
manner
every
movement
and
pose
was
full
of
grace
and
he
had
the
brightest
eyes
that
i
have
ever
seen
but
blue
bandala
was
clearly
a
show
animal
could
our
little
david
beat
this
very
goliath
among
dogs
and
that
upon
the
latter
own
ground
could
our
little
amateur
take
on
a
professional
and
beat
him
at
his
own
game
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
that
angels
would
at
least
have
walked
delicately
where
we
had
rushed
in
however
it
was
too
late
now
even
if
we
would
we
could
not
draw
back
beyond
doing
what
we
could
to
keep
him
as
fit
as
a
fiddle
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
after
a
bath
i
put
on
a
tweed
suit
concealed
my
discarded
and
sole
surviving
pair
of
white
trousers
from
the
rapacious
eye
of
a
random
housemaid
and
descended
to
lunch
an
hour
later
adèle
and
nobby
and
i
were
all
in
the
rolls
sailing
along
the
soft
brown
roads
for
fallow
hill
it
was
a
day
of
great
loveliness
and
the
forest
ways
were
one
and
all
beset
with
a
rare
glory
hours
before
the
first
frost
of
autumn
had
touched
the
breast
of
earth
with
silver
was
but
a
runaway
knock
the
knave
was
gone
again
before
the
bustling
dame
had
braced
herself
to
open
to
her
pert
visitor
maybe
the
rogue
was
beating
up
his
quarters
the
time
of
his
dreaded
lodgment
was
not
yet
his
apprehensive
hostess
was
full
of
smiles
summer
was
staying
on
yet
on
the
livery
of
the
countryside
the
accolade
of
frost
had
wrought
a
wonder
two
days
ago
the
world
was
green
a
million
leaves
glanced
green
as
before
yet
with
a
lustre
something
of
red
in
it
something
of
gold
something
of
sober
brown
but
the
wonder
was
not
to
the
trees
it
was
the
humble
bracken
that
had
been
dubbed
knight
the
homespun
of
the
forest
was
become
cloth
of
pure
gold
glittering
flawless
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
change
had
come
here
was
an
acre
spread
with
the
delicate
fronds
and
there
a
ragged
mile
and
yonder
but
shreds
and
patches
yet
all
of
magic
gold
flinging
the
sunlight
back
lighting
the
shadows
making
the
humblest
ride
too
rich
for
kings
to
trample
till
the
green
roofs
and
walls
looked
dull
beside
it
and
the
ephemeral
magnificence
took
memory
by
the
throat
and
wrung
a
lease
of
life
from
that
reversioner
tell
me
i
said
of
bason
he
interests
me
and
i
never
seen
him
bason
said
adèle
is
short
and
fat
and
yes
i
afraid
greasy
he
has
bright
yellow
hair
and
a
ridiculous
moustache
which
is
brushed
up
on
end
on
each
side
of
his
nostrils
he
has
very
watery
pale
blue
eyes
and
all
the
blood
in
his
face
seems
to
have
gone
to
his
nose
muscular
rheumatism
i
suggested
i
guess
so
of
course
he
knows
best
and
i
do
pretend
to
say
what
men
should
wear
but
white
flannel
suits
are
becoming
to
every
figure
are
they
most
of
the
rest
of
him
was
mauve
shirt
socks
and
handkerchief
oh
and
he
had
a
tie
on
his
pin
but
how
lovely
yes
but
you
should
have
smelt
the
lilac
he
was
just
perfumed
to
death
if
he
is
careful
one
of
these
days
he
get
picked
one
of
the
old
school
in
fact
well
well
we
swept
round
a
corner
and
i
nodded
ahead
see
that
ridge
in
front
of
us
well
fallow
hill
the
village
lies
close
just
on
the
other
side
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
the
car
said
adèle
they
let
me
lock
her
up
do
be
shocked
at
the
brewery
i
know
them
there
you
admit
it
sounds
bad
yes
but
it
smells
lovely
you
wait
for
that
reason
alone
i
should
vote
against
prohibition
the
honest
scent
of
brewing
stealing
across
the
meadows
on
a
summer
eve
is
one
of
the
most
inspiring
things
i
know
but
what
a
man
said
adèle
in
the
running
brooks
in
and
good
in
everything
nobby
she
added
reproachfully
why
did
you
tell
me
he
was
a
poet
the
sealyham
put
his
head
on
one
side
as
if
desiring
her
to
repeat
the
question
oh
you
cute
thing
and
with
that
my
lady
bent
and
kissed
the
terrier
between
the
bright
brown
eyes
i
put
the
wheel
over
hard
and
the
car
swerved
violently
for
heaven
sake
cried
miss
feste
what
are
you
doing
it
your
fault
said
i
i
only
human
besides
he
does
deserve
it
adèle
flung
me
a
dazzling
smile
made
as
though
she
would
say
something
and
then
apparently
changing
her
mind
relapsed
into
a
provoking
silence
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
the
rolls
had
been
safely
bestowed
at
the
brewery
and
my
companion
and
i
were
making
our
way
amusedly
past
booths
and
tents
and
caravans
where
chapmen
hucksters
drovers
cheapjacks
gipsies
and
bawling
showmen
wrangled
and
chaffered
and
cried
their
wares
or
entertainments
making
with
the
crude
music
of
the
much
the
same
uproar
which
had
been
faithfully
rendered
at
the
village
of
fallow
hill
every
september
for
the
last
five
hundred
years
blessings
on
your
sweet
pretty
face
my
lady
cried
an
old
voice
we
turned
to
see
a
very
old
gipsy
seated
a
little
apart
upon
a
backless
chair
nodding
and
smiling
in
our
direction
adèle
inclined
her
head
and
i
slid
a
hand
into
my
pocket
come
hither
to
me
my
lady
piped
the
old
dame
and
let
your
man
cross
my
old
palm
with
silver
and
i
tell
you
your
fortune
ah
but
you
have
a
happy
face
adèle
looked
at
me
and
i
nodded
they
a
good
folk
i
said
and
you
get
better
stuff
for
your
money
than
you
would
in
bond
street
but
do
if
you
do
want
to
my
words
could
not
have
been
heard
by
the
gipsy
yet
before
adèle
could
reply
aye
she
said
the
pretty
gentleman
right
we
a
good
folk
and
there
be
some
among
us
can
see
farther
than
the
dwellers
in
towns
adèle
started
and
the
crone
laughed
come
hither
my
lady
and
let
me
look
in
your
eyes
she
was
an
old
old
woman
but
the
hair
that
thrust
from
beneath
her
kerchief
was
not
thin
her
face
was
shrunken
and
wrinkled
yet
and
her
great
eyes
glowed
with
a
strange
brilliance
as
if
there
were
fires
kindled
deep
in
the
wasted
sockets
adèle
stepped
forward
when
to
my
amazement
the
gipsy
put
up
her
hands
and
groped
for
the
girl
shoulders
the
significance
of
the
gesture
was
plain
she
was
stone
blind
for
a
while
she
mumbled
and
since
i
had
not
gone
close
i
did
not
hear
what
she
said
but
adèle
was
smiling
and
i
saw
the
colour
come
flooding
into
her
cheeks
then
the
old
dame
lifted
up
her
voice
and
called
to
me
to
come
also
i
went
to
her
side
an
old
gnarled
hand
fumbled
its
way
on
to
my
arm
aye
she
piped
aye
tis
as
i
thought
your
man
also
must
lose
ere
he
find
together
ye
shall
lose
and
together
gain
and
ye
shall
comfort
one
another
the
tremulous
voice
ceased
and
the
hands
slipped
away
i
gave
her
money
and
adèle
thanked
her
prettily
she
cried
a
blessing
upon
us
i
whistled
to
nobby
and
we
strolled
on
look
at
that
baby
said
adèle
is
he
cute
half
a
second
said
i
turning
and
whistling
which
baby
there
said
adèle
pointing
with
the
golden
hair
a
child
regarded
us
with
a
shy
smile
it
was
impossible
not
to
respond
again
i
turned
and
whistled
where
can
he
be
said
adèle
anxiously
oh
he
always
turns
up
i
said
but
if
you
do
mind
going
back
a
little
way
it
save
time
with
all
this
noise
we
went
back
a
little
way
then
we
went
back
a
long
way
then
we
asked
people
if
they
had
seen
a
little
white
dog
with
a
black
patch
always
the
answer
was
in
the
negative
one
man
laughed
and
said
something
about
a
dog
in
a
fair
and
fear
began
to
knock
at
my
heart
i
whistled
until
the
muscles
of
my
lips
ached
adèle
wanted
us
to
search
separately
but
i
refused
it
was
not
a
place
for
her
to
wander
alone
feverishly
we
sought
everywhere
twice
a
white
dog
sent
our
hopes
soaring
only
to
prove
a
stranger
and
dash
them
lower
than
before
round
and
about
and
in
and
out
among
the
booths
and
swings
and
we
hastened
whistling
calling
and
inquiring
in
vain
nobby
was
lost
we
had
intended
to
be
home
in
time
for
tea
as
it
was
we
got
back
to
white
ladies
pale
and
dejected
at
a
quarter
to
eight
as
she
rose
to
get
out
of
the
car
adèle
gave
a
cry
and
felt
frantically
about
her
neck
and
throat
what
the
matter
i
cried
my
pearls
she
said
simply
they
not
here
for
what
it
was
worth
i
called
for
lights
and
we
took
the
cushions
out
and
looked
in
the
car
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
necklace
it
was
clean
gone
the
lamentations
with
which
the
news
of
our
misfortunes
was
received
were
loud
and
exceeding
bitter
jill
burst
into
tears
daphne
tried
vainly
to
comfort
her
and
then
followed
her
example
berry
and
jonah
vied
with
each
other
in
gloomy
of
adèle
and
myself
concerning
our
movements
since
we
had
left
white
ladies
and
in
cheerless
speculation
with
regard
to
the
probable
whereabouts
of
our
respective
treasures
after
a
hurried
meal
the
rolls
was
again
requisitioned
and
all
six
of
us
proceeded
to
fallow
hill
not
until
eleven
would
the
fun
of
the
fair
be
suspended
and
it
was
better
to
be
on
the
spot
even
if
for
the
second
time
we
had
to
come
empty
away
than
to
spend
the
evening
in
the
torment
of
inactivity
of
the
loss
of
the
sealyham
we
could
speak
more
definitely
than
of
that
of
the
necklace
nobby
had
been
by
my
side
when
the
gipsy
hailed
us
so
that
there
was
no
doubt
but
that
he
was
lost
at
the
fair
regarding
her
pearls
adèle
could
speak
less
positively
in
fact
to
say
that
she
had
had
the
necklace
before
breakfast
that
morning
was
really
as
far
as
she
could
go
i
know
i
had
it
then
she
affirmed
because
i
always
take
it
off
before
taking
my
bath
and
i
remember
putting
it
on
afterwards
as
luck
will
have
it
i
was
rather
late
this
morning
and
i
fasten
the
so
after
two
or
three
shots
i
gave
up
trying
intending
to
do
it
later
on
and
this
is
the
result
she
had
not
bathed
again
it
was
a
sweet
pretty
gaud
so
perfectly
matched
were
its
hundred
and
two
pearls
that
many
would
have
believed
it
unreal
it
had
belonged
to
her
and
was
not
insured
arrived
at
fallow
hill
we
went
straight
to
the
police
the
loss
of
the
jewels
we
communicated
to
them
alone
somewhat
shamefacedly
and
plainly
against
adèle
will
i
described
the
old
gipsy
and
commended
her
to
their
vigilance
when
they
learned
that
she
had
laid
hands
upon
adèle
the
two
inspectors
exchanged
glances
which
there
was
no
mistaking
so
far
as
nobby
was
concerned
as
well
as
informing
the
police
we
enlisted
the
sympathy
of
the
boy
scouts
also
we
engaged
six
rustics
to
perambulate
the
fair
and
cry
the
loss
of
the
sealyham
for
all
to
hear
information
leading
to
his
recovery
would
be
rewarded
with
the
sum
of
five
pounds
while
the
crier
to
whom
the
communication
was
made
would
receive
five
more
for
himself
our
six
employees
went
about
their
work
with
a
will
bellowing
lustily
daphne
and
jonah
sat
in
the
car
rejecting
the
luckless
mongrels
which
were
excitedly
paraded
before
them
one
after
another
from
the
moment
that
our
loss
was
made
known
the
rest
of
us
hunted
in
couples
adèle
with
berry
and
jill
with
me
scouring
the
maze
of
temporary
alleys
and
lanes
and
crooked
quadrangles
till
we
knew
them
by
heart
the
had
stopped
whirling
and
the
booths
were
being
shrouded
or
dismantled
as
jill
and
i
made
our
way
to
the
car
for
the
last
time
as
we
came
up
that
you
boy
cried
daphne
here
a
waggoner
who
thinks
he
saw
nobby
being
taken
away
a
little
knot
of
men
parted
and
jill
and
i
thrust
our
way
forward
oi
wouldden
be
sure
said
a
deep
rough
voice
but
a
was
a
lil
white
chap
of
a
dog
on
en
of
a
string
was
a
grume
simly
brooch
way
an
a
did
want
for
to
go
neither
for
a
stock
toes
in
a
did
an
collar
was
over
just
come
forth
from
three
oi
oop
yonder
o
bear
lane
an
the
toime
were
nigh
three
o
the
aafternoon
we
questioned
him
closely
but
he
could
tell
us
no
more
slight
as
the
clue
was
it
was
infinitely
better
than
none
at
all
if
it
was
indeed
nobby
that
the
waggoner
had
seen
the
thief
was
taking
him
out
of
the
village
at
least
in
the
direction
of
white
ladies
this
was
encouraging
that
any
one
making
for
the
railway
station
would
take
the
same
road
was
a
less
pleasant
reflection
i
took
our
informant
name
and
address
and
those
of
the
crier
who
had
brought
him
to
the
car
then
we
dispensed
some
silver
and
left
for
home
of
adèle
necklace
we
had
heard
nothing
we
determined
to
concentrate
upon
the
recovery
of
the
pearls
upon
the
following
day
all
through
a
wretched
night
the
pitiful
vacancy
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
reminded
me
brutally
of
my
loss
my
poor
little
dog
where
was
he
passing
these
dark
hours
how
many
more
must
drag
their
way
along
before
the
warm
white
ball
lay
curled
again
in
the
crook
of
my
knees
had
he
rested
there
for
the
last
time
with
a
groan
i
thrust
the
thought
from
me
but
always
it
returned
leering
hideously
miserably
i
recited
his
qualities
his
love
for
me
his
mettle
his
beauty
his
unfailing
good
humour
what
naughtiness
there
was
in
him
seemed
very
precious
painfully
i
remembered
his
thousand
pretty
ways
he
had
a
trick
of
waving
his
little
paws
when
he
was
tired
of
begging
small
wonder
that
i
slept
ill
and
fitfully
early
as
i
was
the
others
were
already
at
breakfast
when
i
came
down
only
adèle
had
not
appeared
it
was
a
melancholy
meal
jonah
said
not
a
word
and
berry
hardly
opened
his
mouth
there
were
dark
rings
under
jill
grey
eyes
and
daphne
looked
pale
and
tired
a
communication
from
the
secretary
of
the
brooch
dog
show
enclosing
a
pass
for
the
following
day
and
informing
me
that
my
sealyham
must
arrive
at
the
show
in
the
charge
of
not
more
than
one
attendant
by
did
not
tend
to
revive
our
drooping
spirits
we
had
nearly
finished
when
with
a
glance
at
the
clock
my
sister
set
her
foot
upon
the
bell
as
the
butler
entered
the
room
send
up
and
see
if
miss
feste
will
breakfast
upstairs
falcon
i
think
miss
feste
has
breakfasted
madam
already
yes
madam
her
breakfast
was
taken
to
her
before
eight
where
is
she
i
think
she
out
bicycling
madam
bicycling
the
inquiry
leapt
from
five
mouths
simultaneously
yes
madam
she
sent
for
me
and
asked
if
i
could
find
a
bicycle
an
greenaway
was
very
to
lend
madam
an
fitch
pumped
up
the
tires
an
she
went
off
about
eight
madam
we
stared
at
one
another
in
bewilderment
did
she
say
where
she
was
going
said
berry
no
sir
all
right
falcon
the
butler
bowed
and
withdrew
amid
the
chorus
of
astonished
exclamation
berry
held
up
his
hand
it
very
simple
he
said
she
unhinged
rubbish
said
his
wife
the
disappearance
of
nobby
followed
by
the
loss
of
her
necklace
has
preyed
upon
her
mind
regardless
alike
of
my
feelings
and
of
the
canons
of
good
taste
she
rises
at
an
hour
which
is
almost
blasphemous
and
goes
forth
unreasonably
to
indulge
in
the
most
hellish
form
of
exercise
ever
invented
what
further
evidence
do
we
need
by
this
time
she
has
probably
detached
the
lamp
from
the
velocipede
and
is
walking
about
saying
she
florence
nightingale
idiot
said
daphne
not
yet
said
her
husband
but
i
can
feel
it
coming
on
he
cast
an
eye
downward
and
shivered
i
feared
as
much
my
left
leg
is
all
unbuttoned
for
goodness
sake
said
his
wife
do
sit
there
drivelling
sorry
said
berry
but
i
have
got
a
clean
bib
left
this
laundry
strike
i
said
not
you
know
i
did
and
what
are
we
wasting
time
for
let
do
something
anything
said
her
husband
what
about
giving
the
bread
some
birds
and
with
that
he
picked
up
a
loaf
and
deliberately
pitched
it
out
of
the
window
on
to
the
terrace
the
fact
that
the
casement
was
not
open
until
after
the
cast
made
his
behaviour
the
more
outrageous
the
very
wantonness
of
the
act
however
had
the
excellent
effect
of
breaking
the
spell
of
melancholy
under
which
we
were
labouring
in
a
moment
all
was
confusion
jill
burst
into
shrieks
of
laughter
jonah
who
had
been
immersed
in
cursed
his
cousin
for
the
shock
to
his
nerves
in
a
shaking
voice
daphne
assured
the
butler
whom
the
crash
had
brought
running
that
it
was
all
right
falcon
major
pleydell
thought
the
window
was
open
and
the
delinquent
himself
was
loudly
clamouring
to
be
told
whether
he
had
won
the
outright
or
had
only
got
to
keep
it
clean
for
one
year
twenty
minutes
later
jonah
had
left
for
brooch
to
see
the
chief
constable
about
the
missing
jewels
and
arrange
for
the
printing
and
distribution
of
an
advertisement
for
nobby
the
rest
of
us
doing
our
utmost
to
garnish
a
forlorn
hope
with
the
seasoning
of
expectation
made
diligent
search
for
the
necklace
about
the
terrace
gardens
and
after
a
fruitless
two
hours
we
repaired
to
the
house
where
we
probed
the
depths
of
sofas
and
chairs
emptied
settles
and
every
other
receptacle
over
which
our
guest
might
have
leaned
and
finally
thrust
an
electric
torch
into
the
bowels
of
the
piano
and
subjected
that
instrument
to
a
thorough
examination
at
length
i
give
it
up
said
daphne
sinking
into
a
chair
i
do
think
it
can
be
here
nor
i
said
i
i
think
we
looked
everywhere
yes
said
berry
there
only
the
cesspool
left
we
can
drag
that
before
lunch
if
you
like
but
i
should
prefer
one
more
full
meal
before
i
die
boy
boy
somewhere
from
behind
closed
doors
a
sweet
excited
voice
was
calling
i
sprang
to
the
door
yes
adèle
yes
i
shouted
a
moment
later
my
lady
sped
down
a
passage
and
into
the
hall
get
the
car
quick
i
found
nobby
where
we
yelled
that
man
bason
got
him
her
announcement
momentarily
deprived
us
of
breath
then
we
all
started
and
in
the
next
two
minutes
sufficient
was
said
about
the
retired
proprietor
to
make
that
gentleman
pendulous
ears
burst
into
blue
flame
again
want
of
breath
intervened
and
adèle
besought
us
to
make
ready
the
car
we
explained
vociferously
that
jonah
had
taken
the
rolls
and
would
be
back
any
minute
whilst
we
were
waiting
would
she
not
tell
us
her
tale
seating
herself
upon
the
arm
of
a
chair
she
complied
forthwith
none
of
you
seemed
to
suspect
him
and
as
i
usually
wrong
i
decided
to
say
nothing
but
last
night
i
asked
a
boy
scout
where
he
lived
curiously
enough
the
boy
had
a
brother
who
was
a
gardener
in
employ
that
made
me
think
i
asked
him
whether
i
could
have
a
word
with
his
brother
and
he
told
me
he
lived
at
a
cottage
close
to
his
work
and
was
almost
always
at
home
between
nine
and
in
the
morning
when
he
came
home
this
morning
i
was
waiting
for
him
he
seemed
a
nice
man
so
i
told
him
the
truth
and
asked
him
to
help
me
thorn
that
his
name
does
like
bason
a
bit
and
at
once
agreed
that
he
was
quite
capable
of
the
dirtiest
work
if
any
one
got
in
his
way
he
had
he
said
seen
nobby
but
that
was
surprising
if
the
dog
was
there
probably
be
in
the
stables
and
with
those
thorn
has
nothing
to
do
bason
does
keep
horses
but
he
uses
one
of
the
as
a
garage
the
chauffeur
seems
to
be
rather
worse
than
his
master
loathed
by
the
rest
of
the
staff
and
while
he
and
bason
are
as
thick
as
thieves
neither
trusts
the
other
an
inch
the
first
thing
to
do
obviously
was
to
find
out
if
nobby
was
there
everything
was
always
kept
locked
so
i
determined
to
try
the
stunt
yes
i
know
a
lot
of
english
history
and
try
and
make
coeur
de
lion
speak
for
himself
first
we
synchronized
our
watches
then
thorn
showed
me
the
house
and
told
me
exactly
where
the
garage
and
stables
were
close
to
the
gates
happily
then
we
arranged
that
in
ten
minutes
time
he
should
try
to
get
the
chauffeur
out
of
the
way
while
i
took
a
look
round
more
than
that
we
could
fix
but
it
was
understood
that
if
there
was
a
dog
there
and
thorn
got
an
opening
he
was
to
undo
his
collar
and
give
him
a
chance
to
make
good
on
his
own
that
would
involve
thorn
for
he
could
fasten
the
collar
again
and
make
it
look
as
if
nobby
had
slipped
it
but
what
a
brain
said
berry
one
short
month
of
my
society
and
the
girl
an
avalanche
of
protest
cut
short
the
speaker
adèle
continued
gurgling
at
first
everything
went
all
right
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
i
put
my
head
round
the
corner
to
see
the
chauffeur
and
thorn
disappearing
at
the
other
end
of
the
yard
i
stepped
out
of
my
cover
and
had
a
look
round
there
were
stables
on
one
side
and
a
coachhouse
and
garage
on
the
other
and
the
yard
which
was
open
at
both
ends
lay
in
between
i
was
just
going
to
try
the
i
was
going
to
like
a
cat
and
see
what
answer
i
got
when
i
heard
bason
voice
calling
banana
there
was
only
one
door
open
and
that
was
the
garage
i
dashed
for
it
and
looked
round
for
somewhere
to
hide
the
place
was
as
bare
as
your
hand
but
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
the
limousine
so
i
got
inside
and
sat
down
on
the
floor
i
was
only
just
in
time
bason
came
stamping
into
the
yard
shouting
for
and
the
next
moment
nobby
gave
tongue
i
just
had
to
look
there
was
blue
banana
with
his
nose
to
the
door
of
the
immediately
opposite
snarling
and
showing
his
teeth
bason
was
hammering
on
the
door
yelling
up
you
brute
and
nobby
of
course
was
barking
to
beat
the
band
as
she
spoke
a
faint
familiar
cough
from
the
drive
announced
the
return
of
jonah
from
brooch
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
record
i
had
flown
to
the
and
put
him
wise
two
minutes
later
we
were
all
in
the
rolls
which
was
scudding
at
an
unlawful
speed
along
the
fallow
hill
road
there
nothing
much
more
to
tell
said
adèle
as
we
clamoured
for
her
to
proceed
i
thought
bason
would
never
go
and
when
at
last
he
did
the
chauffeur
took
the
opportunity
of
changing
the
two
front
tires
for
over
two
hours
i
sat
in
that
car
at
last
the
man
shut
the
place
up
and
i
suppose
went
to
his
dinner
i
had
meant
to
borrow
the
limousine
but
he
taken
the
key
of
the
switch
so
i
could
do
that
and
i
could
get
at
nobby
for
the
stable
was
locked
so
i
just
pelted
back
to
thorn
cottage
told
his
wife
to
tell
him
my
news
picked
up
the
bicycle
and
came
right
back
for
a
moment
no
one
said
anything
then
i
shall
recommend
you
said
berry
for
the
most
excellent
order
of
the
beer
engine
a
very
coveted
distinction
the
membership
is
limited
to
seven
million
yes
said
i
for
a
most
daring
reconnaissance
behind
the
lines
you
know
this
ranks
with
the
penetration
of
the
kiel
canal
seriously
adèle
i
terribly
grateful
my
lady
looked
at
me
with
a
shy
smile
what
did
the
gipsy
say
she
said
after
all
i
only
obeying
orders
and
now
a
cry
from
jonah
interrupted
her
and
the
rest
of
us
started
inquiringly
as
he
clapped
on
the
brakes
as
the
car
came
to
a
standstill
what
the
matter
i
cried
by
way
of
answer
my
cousin
took
off
his
hat
and
producing
a
silk
handkerchief
deliberately
wiped
his
forehead
with
the
utmost
care
then
he
replaced
his
hat
and
looked
up
and
over
his
right
shoulder
from
the
top
of
a
mossy
bank
by
the
side
of
the
road
nobby
was
regarding
us
apparently
he
had
broken
prison
and
was
on
his
way
home
time
was
nothing
to
him
and
the
roots
of
a
wayside
beech
upon
an
attractive
rise
cried
aloud
for
inspection
besides
there
was
a
serious
loss
of
liberty
which
had
to
be
made
good
for
a
moment
and
prize
looked
one
another
in
the
face
then
the
latter
hurled
himself
panting
into
the
road
and
leapt
into
the
arms
which
i
stretched
out
of
the
car
no
prodigal
ever
received
such
an
ovation
there
was
literally
a
fight
for
his
person
jill
snatched
him
from
me
and
pressed
his
nose
to
her
face
berry
dragged
him
from
her
protesting
arms
and
set
him
upon
his
knee
daphne
tore
him
away
and
hugged
him
close
such
of
us
as
were
temporarily
disseized
stroked
and
fondled
his
limbs
and
cried
endearing
epithets
only
our
fair
american
looked
on
with
a
wistful
smile
so
you
see
she
said
he
done
without
me
after
all
i
took
hold
of
her
hand
my
dear
i
said
your
argument
would
be
more
forcible
if
he
was
wearing
a
collar
there
was
a
buzz
of
excitement
as
my
statement
was
feverishly
confirmed
i
agree
said
berry
what
more
he
brought
us
a
souvenir
as
he
spoke
he
plucked
something
which
was
adhering
to
the
beard
it
was
a
tuft
of
hair
the
all
comers
event
was
won
by
nobby
who
beat
a
french
bulldog
by
a
short
head
neither
blue
bandala
nor
his
owner
put
in
an
appearance
for
this
a
particularly
curt
note
bluntly
requiring
the
return
of
the
collar
may
have
been
responsible
the
waggoner
and
the
lad
who
found
him
received
their
rewards
so
also
did
thorn
his
letter
of
acknowledgment
was
addressed
to
adèle
madam
you
kindly
for
the
lbs
i
got
to
the
dog
by
way
of
the
ayloft
which
were
in
one
of
the
stalls
i
undone
is
coller
and
here
he
run
out
the
first
dore
as
was
open
and
appening
on
blew
bandarlerer
did
not
harf
put
it
acrost
him
and
bason
says
i
command
you
to
seperate
them
dogs
arthur
he
says
and
arthur
fetches
blew
one
what
he
ment
for
your
dog
and
bason
fetches
him
another
what
he
ment
for
arthur
so
the
chough
cort
it
respecfully
but
for
the
loss
of
the
pearls
we
should
have
been
jubilant
three
days
had
elapsed
since
the
dog
show
the
whole
of
the
morning
and
part
of
the
afternoon
i
had
spent
in
a
bathroom
supervising
the
disconnection
severance
and
inspection
of
the
which
served
the
basin
when
hot
and
dejected
i
made
my
report
at
three
adèle
thanked
me
as
prettily
as
if
i
had
found
the
pearls
i
retired
to
wash
and
change
into
flannels
it
must
have
been
two
hours
later
when
i
looked
up
from
the
operation
of
combing
nobby
and
took
my
pipe
from
my
mouth
oh
adèle
i
said
simply
i
do
love
you
so
adèle
put
out
a
hand
and
touched
my
hair
i
glad
you
do
she
said
gently
as
i
got
upon
my
feet
one
end
of
her
necklace
hung
trailing
over
the
edge
of
my
trousers
where
i
had
turned
them
up
they
were
the
pair
i
had
worn
at
tennis
the
day
we
had
gone
to
the
fair
and
it
must
have
fallen
into
the
fold
when
we
were
finding
the
thorn
adèle
saw
it
too
but
when
i
would
have
stooped
she
shook
her
head
then
i
looked
into
her
eyes
and
there
found
such
a
light
that
i
forgot
the
pearls
and
the
rolling
world
with
them
as
she
slipped
into
my
arms
she
threw
back
her
head
once
at
port
said
you
kissed
me
she
whispered
and
again
at
rome
i
nodded
but
this
is
your
own
home
yes
i
said
steadily
and
here
i
plight
thee
my
troth
the
brown
eyes
closed
and
a
glorious
smile
swept
into
the
beautiful
face
for
a
moment
i
gazed
at
her
then
i
kissed
the
red
red
lips
so
we
comforted
one
another
the
unexpected
arrival
of
the
laundry
van
at
five
minutes
to
eight
with
amongst
other
things
a
month
had
pardonably
dislocated
the
service
of
dinner
whilst
the
table
was
being
relaid
we
spent
the
time
in
the
library
gathered
about
the
comfort
of
a
fire
you
know
said
jonah
looking
up
from
an
armchair
if
we
do
good
heavens
his
exclamation
was
so
violent
that
we
all
jumped
why
he
cried
staring
at
adèle
