chapter
i
a
very
little
boy
stood
upon
a
heap
of
gravel
for
the
honor
of
rum
alley
he
was
throwing
stones
at
howling
urchins
from
devil
row
who
were
circling
madly
about
the
heap
and
pelting
at
him
his
infantile
countenance
was
livid
with
fury
his
small
body
was
writhing
in
the
delivery
of
great
crimson
oaths
run
jimmie
run
dey
get
yehs
screamed
a
retreating
rum
alley
child
naw
responded
jimmie
with
a
valiant
roar
dese
micks
ca
make
me
run
howls
of
renewed
wrath
went
up
from
devil
row
throats
tattered
gamins
on
the
right
made
a
furious
assault
on
the
gravel
heap
on
their
small
convulsed
faces
there
shone
the
grins
of
true
assassins
as
they
charged
they
threw
stones
and
cursed
in
shrill
chorus
the
little
champion
of
rum
alley
stumbled
precipitately
down
the
other
side
his
coat
had
been
torn
to
shreds
in
a
scuffle
and
his
hat
was
gone
he
had
bruises
on
twenty
parts
of
his
body
and
blood
was
dripping
from
a
cut
in
his
head
his
wan
features
wore
a
look
of
a
tiny
insane
demon
on
the
ground
children
from
devil
row
closed
in
on
their
antagonist
he
crooked
his
left
arm
defensively
about
his
head
and
fought
with
cursing
fury
the
little
boys
ran
to
and
fro
dodging
hurling
stones
and
swearing
in
barbaric
trebles
from
a
window
of
an
apartment
house
that
upreared
its
form
from
amid
squat
ignorant
stables
there
leaned
a
curious
woman
some
laborers
unloading
a
scow
at
a
dock
at
the
river
paused
for
a
moment
and
regarded
the
fight
the
engineer
of
a
passive
tugboat
hung
lazily
to
a
railing
and
watched
over
on
the
island
a
worm
of
yellow
convicts
came
from
the
shadow
of
a
building
and
crawled
slowly
along
the
bank
a
stone
had
smashed
into
jimmie
mouth
blood
was
bubbling
over
his
chin
and
down
upon
his
ragged
shirt
tears
made
furrows
on
his
cheeks
his
thin
legs
had
begun
to
tremble
and
turn
weak
causing
his
small
body
to
reel
his
roaring
curses
of
the
first
part
of
the
fight
had
changed
to
a
blasphemous
chatter
in
the
yells
of
the
whirling
mob
of
devil
row
children
there
were
notes
of
joy
like
songs
of
triumphant
savagery
the
little
boys
seemed
to
leer
gloatingly
at
the
blood
upon
the
other
child
face
down
the
avenue
came
boastfully
sauntering
a
lad
of
sixteen
years
although
the
chronic
sneer
of
an
ideal
manhood
already
sat
upon
his
lips
his
hat
was
tipped
with
an
air
of
challenge
over
his
eye
between
his
teeth
a
cigar
stump
was
tilted
at
the
angle
of
defiance
he
walked
with
a
certain
swing
of
the
shoulders
which
appalled
the
timid
he
glanced
over
into
the
vacant
lot
in
which
the
little
raving
boys
from
devil
row
seethed
about
the
shrieking
and
tearful
child
from
rum
alley
gee
he
murmured
with
interest
a
scrap
gee
he
strode
over
to
the
cursing
circle
swinging
his
shoulders
in
a
manner
which
denoted
that
he
held
victory
in
his
fists
he
approached
at
the
back
of
one
of
the
most
deeply
engaged
of
the
devil
row
children
ah
what
deh
hell
he
said
and
smote
the
one
on
the
back
of
the
head
the
little
boy
fell
to
the
ground
and
gave
a
hoarse
tremendous
howl
he
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
perceiving
evidently
the
size
of
his
assailant
ran
quickly
off
shouting
alarms
the
entire
devil
row
party
followed
him
they
came
to
a
stand
a
short
distance
away
and
yelled
taunting
oaths
at
the
boy
with
the
chronic
sneer
the
latter
momentarily
paid
no
attention
to
them
what
deh
hell
jimmie
he
asked
of
the
small
champion
jimmie
wiped
his
features
with
his
sleeve
well

alley
children
now
came
forward
the
party
stood
for
a
moment
exchanging
vainglorious
remarks
with
devil
row
a
few
stones
were
thrown
at
long
distances
and
words
of
challenge
passed
between
small
warriors
then
the
rum
alley
contingent
turned
slowly
in
the
direction
of
their
home
street
they
began
to
give
each
to
each
distorted
versions
of
the
fight
causes
of
retreat
in
particular
cases
were
magnified
blows
dealt
in
the
fight
were
enlarged
to
catapultian
power
and
stones
thrown
were
alleged
to
have
hurtled
with
infinite
accuracy
valor
grew
strong
again
and
the
little
boys
began
to
swear
with
great
spirit
ah

blokies

hull
damn
row
said
a
child
swaggering
little
jimmie
was
striving
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
from
his
cut
lips
scowling
he
turned
upon

speaker

in

tone

and

on
the
cobble

pete
the
lad
with
the
chronic
sneer
in
tones
of
delight
the
small
combatants
pounded
and
kicked
scratched
and
tore
they
began
to
weep
and
their
curses
struggled
in
their
throats
with
sobs
the
other
little
boys
clasped
their
hands
and
wriggled
their
legs
in
excitement
they
formed
a
bobbing
circle
about
the
pair
a
tiny
spectator
was
suddenly
agitated
cheese
it
jimmie
cheese
it
here
comes
yer
fader
he
yelled
the
circle
of
little
boys
instantly
parted
they
drew
away
and
waited
in
ecstatic
awe
for
that
which
was
about
to
happen
the
two
little
boys
fighting
in
the
modes
of
four
thousand
years
ago
did
not
hear
the
warning
up
the
avenue
there
plodded
slowly
a
man
with
sullen
eyes
he
was
carrying
a
dinner
pail
and
smoking
an
pipe
as
he
neared
the
spot
where
the
little
boys
strove
he
regarded
them
listlessly
but
suddenly
he
roared
an
oath
and
advanced
upon
the
rolling
fighters
here
you
jim
git
up
now
while
i
belt
yer
life
out
you
damned
disorderly
brat
he
began
to
kick
into
the
chaotic
mass
on
the
ground
the
boy
billie
felt
a
heavy
boot
strike
his
head
he
made
a
furious
effort
and
disentangled
himself
from
jimmie
he
tottered
away
damning
jimmie
arose
painfully
from
the
ground
and
confronting
his
father
began
to
curse
him
his
parent
kicked
him
come
home
now
he
cried
an
stop
yer
jawin
er
i
lam
the
everlasting
head
off
yehs
they
departed
the
man
paced
placidly
along
with
the
emblem
of
serenity
between
his
teeth
the
boy
followed
a
dozen
feet
in
the
rear
he
swore
luridly
for
he
felt
that
it
was
degradation
for
one
who
aimed
to
be
some
vague
soldier
or
a
man
of
blood
with
a
sort
of
sublime
license
to
be
taken
home
by
a
father
chapter
ii
eventually
they
entered
into
a
dark
region
where
from
a
careening
building
a
dozen
gruesome
doorways
gave
up
loads
of
babies
to
the
street
and
the
gutter
a
wind
of
early
autumn
raised
yellow
dust
from
cobbles
and
swirled
it
against
an
hundred
windows
long
streamers
of
garments
fluttered
from
in
all
unhandy
places
there
were
buckets
brooms
rags
and
bottles
in
the
street
infants
played
or
fought
with
other
infants
or
sat
stupidly
in
the
way
of
vehicles
formidable
women
with
uncombed
hair
and
disordered
dress
gossiped
while
leaning
on
railings
or
screamed
in
frantic
quarrels
withered
persons
in
curious
postures
of
submission
to
something
sat
smoking
pipes
in
obscure
corners
a
thousand
odors
of
cooking
food
came
forth
to
the
street
the
building
quivered
and
creaked
from
the
weight
of
humanity
stamping
about
in
its
bowels
a
small
ragged
girl
dragged
a
red
bawling
infant
along
the
crowded
ways
he
was
hanging
back
bracing
his
wrinkled
bare
legs
the
little
girl
cried
out
ah
tommie
come
ahn
dere
jimmie
and
fader
do
be
me
back
she
jerked
the
baby
arm
impatiently
he
fell
on
his
face
roaring
with
a
second
jerk
she
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
they
went
on
with
the
obstinacy
of
his
order
he
protested
against
being
dragged
in
a
chosen
direction
he
made
heroic
endeavors
to
keep
on
his
legs
denounce
his
sister
and
consume
a
bit
of
orange
peeling
which
he
chewed
between
the
times
of
his
infantile
orations
as
the
man
followed
by
the
boy
drew
near
the
little
girl
burst
into
reproachful
cries
ah

disdainfully
ah

at

as
his

continued
her
lamentations
he
suddenly
swore
and
struck
her
the
little
girl
reeled
and
recovering
herself
burst
into
tears
and
quaveringly
cursed
him
as
she
slowly
retreated
her
brother
advanced
dealing
her
cuffs
the
father

and
turned
about

street

into

wooden
head
the
urchin
raised
his
voice
in
defiance
to
his
parent
and
continued
his
attacks
the
babe
bawled
tremendously
protesting
with
great
violence
during
his
sister
hasty
manoeuvres
he
was
dragged
by
the
arm
finally
the
procession
plunged
into
one
of
the
gruesome
doorways
they
crawled
up
dark
stairways
and
along
cold
gloomy
halls
at
last
the
father
pushed
open
a
door
and
they
entered
a
lighted
room
in
which
a
large
woman
was
rampant
she
stopped
in
a
career
from
a
seething
stove
to
a
table
as
the
father
and
children
filed
in
she
peered
at
them
eh
what
been
fightin
agin
by

she
threw
herself
upon
jimmie
the
urchin
tried
to
dart
behind
the
others
and
in
the
scuffle
the
babe
tommie
was
knocked
down
he
protested
with
his
usual
vehemence
because
they
had
bruised
his
tender
shins
against
a
table
leg
the
mother
massive
shoulders
heaved
with
anger
grasping
the
urchin
by
the
neck
and
shoulder
she
shook
him
until
he
rattled
she
dragged
him
to
an
unholy
sink
and
soaking
a
rag
in
water
began
to
scrub
his
lacerated
face
with
it
jimmie
screamed
in
pain
and
tried
to
twist
his
shoulders
out
of
the
clasp
of
the
huge
arms
the
babe
sat
on
the
floor
watching
the
scene
his
face
in
contortions
like
that
of
a
woman
at
a
tragedy
the
father
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
crouched
on
a
backless
chair
near
the
stove
jimmie
cries
annoyed
him
he
turned
about
and
bellowed
at
his
wife

the
woman
operations
on
the
urchin
instantly
increased
in
violence
at
last
she
tossed
him
to
a
corner
where
he
limply
lay
cursing
and
weeping
the
wife
put
her
immense
hands
on
her
hips
and
with
a
stride
approached
her
husband
ho
she
said
with
a
great
grunt
of
contempt
an
what
in
the
devil
are

stickin
your
nose
for
the
babe
crawled
under
the
table
and
turning
peered
out
cautiously
the
ragged
girl
retreated
and
the
urchin
in
the
corner
drew
his
legs
carefully
beneath
him
the
man
puffed
his
pipe
calmly
and
put
his
great
mudded
boots
on
the
back
part
of
the
stove

hell
he
murmured
tranquilly
the
woman
screamed
and
shook
her
fists
before
her
husband
eyes
the
rough
yellow
of
her
face
and
neck
flared
suddenly
crimson
she
began
to
howl
he
puffed
imperturbably
at
his
pipe
for
a
time
but
finally
arose
and
began
to
look
out
at
the
window
into
the
darkening
chaos
of
back
yards

said

roared
in
reply
they
had
a
lurid
altercation
in
which
they
damned
each
other
souls
with
frequence
the
babe
was
staring
out
from
under
the
table
his
small
face
working
in
his
excitement
the
ragged
girl
went
stealthily
over
to
the
corner
where
the
urchin
lay

he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
as
if
resolved
to
grimly
bide
his
time
in
the
quarrel
between
husband
and
wife
the
woman
was
victor
the
man
grabbed
his
hat
and
rushed
from
the
room
apparently
determined
upon
a
vengeful
drunk
she
followed
to
the
door
and
thundered
at
him
as
he
made
his
way
down
stairs
she
returned
and
stirred
up
the
room
until
her
children
were
bobbing
about
like
bubbles

she
persistently
bawled
waving
feet
with
their
dishevelled
shoes
near
the
heads
of
her
children
she
shrouded
herself
puffing
and
snorting
in
a
cloud
of
steam
at
the
stove
and
eventually
extracted
a
full
of
potatoes
that
hissed
she
flourished

cried
with

exasperation

the
children
scrambled
hastily
with
prodigious
clatter
they
arranged
themselves
at
table
the
babe
sat
with
his
feet
dangling
high
from
a
precarious
infant
chair
and
gorged
his
small
stomach
jimmie
forced
with
feverish
rapidity
the
pieces
between
his
wounded
lips
maggie
with
side
glances
of
fear
of
interruption
ate
like
a
small
pursued
tigress
the
mother
sat
blinking
at
them
she
delivered
reproaches
swallowed
potatoes
and
drank
from
a
bottle
after
a
time
her
mood
changed
and
she
wept
as
she
carried
little
tommie
into
another
room
and
laid
him
to
sleep
with
his
fists
doubled
in
an
old
quilt
of
faded
red
and
green
grandeur
then
she
came
and
moaned
by
the
stove
she
rocked
to
and
fro
upon
a
chair
shedding
tears
and
crooning
miserably
to
the
two
children
about
their
poor
mother
and
yer
fader

soul
the
little
girl
plodded
between
the
table
and
the
chair
with
a
on
it
she
tottered
on
her
small
legs
beneath
burdens
of
dishes
jimmie
sat
nursing
his
various
wounds
he
cast
furtive
glances
at
his
mother
his
practised
eye
perceived
her
gradually
emerge
from
a
muddled
mist
of
sentiment
until
her
brain
burned
in
drunken
heat
he
sat
breathless

broke
a
plate
the
mother
started
to
her
feet
as
if

glittered
on
her
child
with
sudden
hatred
the
fervent
red
of
her
face
turned
almost
to
purple
the
little
boy
ran
to
the
halls
shrieking
like
a
monk
in
an
earthquake
he
floundered
about
in
darkness
until
he
found
the
stairs
he
stumbled
to
the
next
floor
an
old
woman
opened
a
door
a
light
behind
her
threw
a
flare
on
the
urchin

chapter
iii
jimmie
and
the
old
woman
listened
long
in
the
hall
above
the
muffled
roar
of
conversation
the
dismal
wailings
of
babies
at
night
the
thumping
of
feet
in
unseen
corridors
and
rooms
mingled
with
the
sound
of
varied
hoarse
shoutings
in
the
street
and
the
rattling
of
wheels
over
cobbles
they
heard
the
screams
of
the
child
and
the
roars
of

mother
die
away
to
a
feeble
moaning
and
a
subdued
bass
muttering
the
old
woman
was
a
gnarled
and
leathery
personage
who
could
don
at
will
an
expression
of
great
virtue
she
possessed
a
small
capable
of
one
tune
and
a
collection
of
god
bless
yehs
pitched
in
assorted
keys
of
fervency
each
day
she
took
a
position
upon
the
stones
of
fifth
avenue
where
she
crooked
her
legs
under
her
and
crouched
immovable
and
hideous
like
an
idol
she
received
daily
a
small
sum
in
pennies
it
was
contributed
for
the
most
part
by
persons
who
did
not
make
their
homes
in
that
vicinity
once
when
a
lady
had
dropped
her
purse
on
the
sidewalk
the
gnarled
woman
had
grabbed
it
and
smuggled
it
with
great
dexterity
beneath
her
cloak
when
she
was
arrested
she
had
cursed
the
lady
into
a
partial
swoon
and
with
her
aged
limbs
twisted
from
rheumatism
had
almost
kicked
the
stomach
out
of
a
huge
policeman
whose
conduct
upon
that
occasion
she
referred
to
when
she
said
the
police
damn
eh
jimmie
it
cursed
shame
she
said
go

like
a
dear

jimmie
took
a
tendered
and
seven
pennies
and
departed
he
passed
into
the
side
door
of
a
saloon
and
went
to
the
bar
straining
up
on
his
toes
he
raised
the
pail
and
pennies
as
high
as
his
arms
would
let
him
he
saw
two
hands
thrust
down
and
take
them
directly
the
same
hands
let
down
the
filled
pail
and
he
left
in
front
of
the
gruesome
doorway
he
met
a
lurching
figure
it
was
his
father
swaying
about
on
uncertain
legs
give

the

threateningly

cried
jimmie
the
father
wrenched
the
pail
from
the
urchin
he
grasped
it
in
both
hands
and
lifted
it
to
his
mouth
he
glued
his
lips
to
the
under
edge
and
tilted
his
head
his
hairy
throat
swelled
until
it
seemed
to
grow
near
his
chin
there
was
a
tremendous
gulping
movement
and
the
beer
was
gone
the
man
caught
his
breath
and
laughed
he
hit
his
son
on
the
head
with
the
empty
pail
as
it
rolled
clanging
into
the
street
jimmie
began
to
scream
and
kicked
repeatedly
at
his
father
shins

he
yelled
deh
ol

he
retreated
to
the
middle
of
the
street
but
the
man
did
not
pursue
he
staggered
toward
the
door
i
club
hell
outa

when
i

he
shouted
and
disappeared
during
the
evening
he
had
been
standing
against
a
bar
drinking
whiskies
and
declaring
to
all
comers
confidentially

jimmie
waited
a
long
time
in
the
street
and
then
crept
warily
up
through
the
building
he
passed
with
great
caution
the
door
of
the
gnarled
woman
and
finally
stopped
outside
his
home
and
listened
he
could
hear
his
mother
moving
heavily
about
among
the
furniture
of
the
room
she
was
chanting
in
a
mournful
voice
occasionally
interjecting
bursts
of
volcanic
wrath
at
the
father
who
jimmie
judged
had
sunk
down
on
the
floor
or
in
a
corner

the

in

wrath
the

seemed
to
become
aroused
go

he
thundered
fiercely
in
reply
there
was
a
crash
against
the
door
and
something
broke
into
clattering
fragments
jimmie
partially
suppressed
a
howl
and
darted
down
the
stairway
below
he
paused
and
listened
he
heard
howls
and
curses
groans
and
shrieks
confusingly
in
chorus
as
if
a
battle
were
raging
with
all
was
the
crash
of
splintering
furniture
the
eyes
of
the
urchin
glared
in
fear
that
one
of
them
would
discover
him
curious
faces
appeared
in
doorways
and
whispered
comments
passed
to
and
fro
ol
johnson
raisin
hell
agin
jimmie
stood
until
the
noises
ceased
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
tenement
had
all
yawned
and
shut
their
doors
then
he
crawled
upstairs
with
the
caution
of
an
invader
of
a
panther
den
sounds
of
labored
breathing
came
through
the
broken
he
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
quaking
a
glow
from
the
fire
threw
red
hues
over
the
bare
floor
the
cracked
and
soiled
plastering
and
the
overturned
and
broken
furniture
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
lay
his
mother
asleep
in
one
corner
of
the
room
his
father
limp
body
hung
across
the
seat
of
a
chair
the
urchin
stole
forward
he
began
to
shiver
in
dread
of
awakening
his
parents
his
mother
great
chest
was
heaving
painfully
jimmie
paused
and
looked
down
at
her
her
face
was
inflamed
and
swollen
from
drinking
her
yellow
brows
shaded
eyelids
that
had
brown
blue
her
tangled
hair
tossed
in
waves
over
her
forehead
her
mouth
was
set
in
the
same
lines
of
vindictive
hatred
that
it
had
perhaps
borne
during
the
fight
her
bare
red
arms
were
thrown
out
above
her
head
in
positions
of
exhaustion
something
mayhap
like
those
of
a
sated
villain
the
urchin
bended
over
his
mother
he
was
fearful
lest
she
should
open
her
eyes
and
the
dread
within
him
was
so
strong
that
he
could
not
forbear
to
stare
but
hung
as
if
fascinated
over
the
woman
grim
face
suddenly
her
eyes
opened
the
urchin
found
himself
looking
straight
into
that
expression
which
it
would
seem
had
the
power
to
change
his
blood
to
salt
he
howled
piercingly
and
fell
backward
the
woman
floundered
for
a
moment
tossed
her
arms
about
her
head
as
if
in
combat
and
again
began
to
snore
jimmie
crawled
back
in
the
shadows
and
waited
a
noise
in
the
next
room
had
followed
his
cry
at
the
discovery
that
his
mother
was
awake
he
grovelled
in
the
gloom
the
eyes
from
out
his
drawn
face
riveted
upon
the
intervening
door
he
heard
it
creak
and
then
the
sound
of
a
small
voice
came
to
him
jimmie
jimmie
are
yehs
dere
it
whispered
the
urchin
started
the
thin
white
face
of
his
sister
looked
at
him
from
the
of
the
other
room
she
crept
to
him
across
the
floor
the
father
had
not
moved
but
lay
in
the
same
sleep
the
mother
writhed
in
uneasy
slumber
her
chest
wheezing
as
if
she
were
in
the
agonies
of
strangulation
out
at
the
window
a
florid
moon
was
peering
over
dark
roofs
and
in
the
distance
the
waters
of
a
river
glimmered
pallidly
the
small
frame
of
the
ragged
girl
was
quivering
her
features
were
haggard
from
weeping
and
her
eyes
gleamed
from
fear
she
grasped
the
urchin
arm
in
her
little
trembling
hands
and
they
huddled
in
a
corner
the
eyes
of
both
were
drawn
by
some
force
to
stare
at
the
woman
face
for
they
thought
she
need
only
to
awake
and
all
fiends
would
come
from
below
they
crouched
until
the
of
dawn
appeared
at
the
window
drawing
close
to
the
panes
and
looking
in
at
the
prostrate
heaving
body
of
the
mother

went
away
in

his

had
stolen
from
an

and
jimmie

the
inexperienced
fibres
of
the
boy
eyes
were
hardened
at
an
early
age
he
became
a
young
man
of
leather
he
lived
some
red
years
without
laboring
during
that
time
his
sneer
became
chronic
he
studied
human
nature
in
the
gutter
and
found
it
no
worse
than
he
thought
he
had
reason
to
believe
it
he
never
conceived
a
respect
for
the
world
because
he
had
begun
with
no
idols
that
it
had
smashed
he
clad
his
soul
in
armor
by
means
of
happening
hilariously
in
at
a
mission
church
where
a
man
composed
his
sermons
of
yous
while
they
got
warm
at
the
stove
he
told
his
hearers
just
where
he
calculated
they
stood
with
the
lord
many
of
the
sinners
were
impatient
over
the
pictured
depths
of
their
degradation
they
were
waiting
for
a
reader
of
words
of
might
have
been
able
to
see
the
portions
of
a
dialogue
pass
to
and
fro
between
the
exhorter
and
his
hearers
you
are
damned
said
the
preacher
and
the
reader
of
sounds
might
have
seen
the
reply
go
forth
from
the
ragged
people
where
our
soup
jimmie
and
a
companion
sat
in
a
rear
seat
and
commented
upon
the
things
that
did
concern
them
with
all
the
freedom
of
english
gentlemen
when
they
grew
thirsty
and
went
out
their
minds
confused
the
speaker
with
christ
momentarily
jimmie
was
sullen
with
thoughts
of
a
hopeless
altitude
where
grew
fruit
his
companion
said
that
if
he
should
ever
meet
god
he
would
ask
for
a
million
dollars
and
a
bottle
of
beer
jimmie
occupation
for
a
long
time
was
to
stand
on
streetcorners
and
watch
the
world
go
by
dreaming
dreams
at
the
passing
of
pretty
women
he
menaced
mankind
at
the
intersections
of
streets
on
the
corners
he
was
in
life
and
of
life
the
world
was
going
on
and
he
was
there
to
perceive
it
he
maintained
a
belligerent
attitude
toward
all
men
to
him
fine
raiment
was
allied
to
weakness
and
all
good
coats
covered
faint
hearts
he
and
his
order
were
kings
to
a
certain
extent
over
the
men
of
untarnished
clothes
because
these
latter
dreaded
perhaps
to
be
either
killed
or
laughed
at
above
all
things
he
despised
obvious
christians
and
ciphers
with
the
chrysanthemums
of
aristocracy
in
their
he
considered
himself
above
both
of
these
classes
he
was
afraid
of
neither
the
devil
nor
the
leader
of
society
when
he
had
a
dollar
in
his
pocket
his
satisfaction
with
existence
was
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
so
eventually
he
felt
obliged
to
work
his
father
died
and
his
mother
years
were
divided
up
into
periods
of
thirty
days
he
became
a
truck
driver
he
was
given
the
charge
of
a
painstaking
pair
of
horses
and
a
large
rattling
truck
he
invaded
the
turmoil
and
tumble
of
the
streets
and
learned
to
breathe
maledictory
defiance
at
the
police
who
occasionally
used
to
climb
up
drag
him
from
his
perch
and
beat
him
in
the
lower
part
of
the
city
he
daily
involved
himself
in
hideous
tangles
if
he
and
his
team
chanced
to
be
in
the
rear
he
preserved
a
demeanor
of
serenity
crossing
his
legs
and
bursting
forth
into
yells
when
foot
passengers
took
dangerous
dives
beneath
the
noses
of
his
champing
horses
he
smoked
his
pipe
calmly
for
he
knew
that
his
pay
was
marching
on
if
in
the
front
and
the
of
chaos
he
entered
terrifically
into
the
quarrel
that
was
raging
to
and
fro
among
the
drivers
on
their
high
seats
and
sometimes
roared
oaths
and
violently
got
himself
arrested
after
a
time
his
sneer
grew
so
that
it
turned
its
glare
upon
all
things
he
became
so
sharp
that
he
believed
in
nothing
to
him
the
police
were
always
actuated
by
malignant
impulses
and
the
rest
of
the
world
was
composed
for
the
most
part
of
despicable
creatures
who
were
all
trying
to
take
advantage
of
him
and
with
whom
in
defense
he
was
obliged
to
quarrel
on
all
possible
occasions
he
himself
occupied
a
position
that
had
a
private
but
distinct
element
of
grandeur
in
its
isolation
the
most
complete
cases
of
aggravated
idiocy
were
to
his
mind
rampant
upon
the
front
platforms
of
all
the
street
cars
at
first
his
tongue
strove
with
these
beings
but
he
eventually
was
superior
he
became
immured
like
an
african
cow
in
him
grew
a
majestic
contempt
for
those
strings
of
street
cars
that
followed
him
like
intent
bugs
he
fell
into
the
habit
when
starting
on
a
long
journey
of
fixing
his
eye
on
a
high
and
distant
object
commanding
his
horses
to
begin
and
then
going
into
a
sort
of
a
trance
of
observation
multitudes
of
drivers
might
howl
in
his
rear
and
passengers
might
load
him
with
opprobrium
he
would
not
awaken
until
some
blue
policeman
turned
red
and
began
to
frenziedly
tear
bridles
and
beat
the
soft
noses
of
the
responsible
horses
when
he
paused
to
contemplate
the
attitude
of
the
police
toward
himself
and
his
fellows
he
believed
that
they
were
the
only
men
in
the
city
who
had
no
rights
when
driving
about
he
felt
that
he
was
held
liable
by
the
police
for
anything
that
might
occur
in
the
streets
and
was
the
common
prey
of
all
energetic
officials
in
revenge
he
resolved
never
to
move
out
of
the
way
of
anything
until
formidable
circumstances
or
a
much
larger
man
than
himself
forced
him
to
it
were
mere
pestering
flies
with
an
insane
disregard
for
their
legs
and
his
convenience
he
could
not
conceive
their
maniacal
desires
to
cross
the
streets
their
madness
smote
him
with
eternal
amazement
he
was
continually
storming
at
them
from
his
throne
he
sat
aloft
and
denounced
their
frantic
leaps
plunges
dives
and
straddles
when
they
would
thrust
at
or
parry
the
noses
of
his
champing
horses
making
them
swing
their
heads
and
move
their
feet
disturbing
a
solid
dreamy
repose
he
swore
at
the
men
as
fools
for
he
himself
could
perceive
that
providence
had
caused
it
clearly
to
be
written
that
he
and
his
team
had
the
unalienable
right
to
stand
in
the
proper
path
of
the
sun
chariot
and
if
they
so
minded
obstruct
its
mission
or
take
a
wheel
off
and
perhaps
if
the
had
an
ungovernable
desire
to
step
down
put
up
his
fists
and
manfully
dispute
the
right
of
way
he
would
have
probably
been
immediately
opposed
by
a
scowling
mortal
with
two
sets
of
very
hard
knuckles
it
is
possible
perhaps
that
this
young
man
would
have
derided
in
an
alley
the
approach
of
a
flying
ferry
boat
yet
he
achieved
a
respect
for
a
fire
engine
as
one
charged
toward
his
truck
he
would
drive
fearfully
upon
a
sidewalk
threatening
untold
people
with
annihilation
when
an
engine
would
strike
a
mass
of
blocked
trucks
splitting
it
into
fragments
as
a
blow
annihilates
a
cake
of
ice
jimmie
team
could
usually
be
observed
high
and
safe
with
whole
wheels
on
the
sidewalk
the
fearful
coming
of
the
engine
could
break
up
the
most
intricate
muddle
of
heavy
vehicles
at
which
the
police
had
been
swearing
for
the
half
of
an
hour
a
fire
engine
was
enshrined
in
his
heart
as
an
appalling
thing
that
he
loved
with
a
distant
devotion
they
had
been
known
to
overturn
those
leaping
horses
striking
sparks
from
the
cobbles
in
their
forward
lunge
were
creatures
to
be
ineffably
admired
the
clang
of
the
gong
pierced
his
breast
like
a
noise
of
remembered
war
when
jimmie
was
a
little
boy
he
began
to
be
arrested
before
he
reached
a
great
age
he
had
a
fair
record
he
developed
too
great
a
tendency
to
climb
down
from
his
truck
and
fight
with
other
drivers
he
had
been
in
quite
a
number
of
miscellaneous
fights
and
in
some
general
barroom
rows
that
had
become
known
to
the
police
once
he
had
been
arrested
for
assaulting
a
chinaman
two
women
in
different
parts
of
the
city
and
entirely
unknown
to
each
other
caused
him
considerable
annoyance
by
breaking
forth
simultaneously
at
fateful
intervals
into
wailings
about
marriage
and
support
and
infants
nevertheless
he
had
on
a
certain
evening
said
wonderingly
and
quite
reverently

seemed
to
be
in
her
veins
the
philosophers
and
on
the
same
floor
puzzled
over
it
when
a
child
playing
and
fighting
with
gamins
in
the
street
dirt
disguised
her
attired
in
tatters
and
grime
she
went
unseen
there
came
a
time
however
when
the
young
men
of
the
vicinity
said
dat
johnson
goil
is
a
puty
good
looker
about
this
period
her
brother
remarked
to
her
mag
i
tell
yeh
dis
see
yeh
edder
got
teh
go
teh
hell
or
go
teh
work
whereupon
she
went
to
work
having
the
feminine
aversion
of
going
to
hell
by
a
chance
she
got
a
position
in
an
establishment
where
they
made
collars
and
cuffs
she
received
a
stool
and
a
machine
in
a
room
where
sat
twenty
girls
of
various
shades
of
yellow
discontent
she
perched
on
the
stool
and
treadled
at
her
machine
all
day
turning
out
collars
the
name
of
whose
brand
could
be
noted
for
its
irrelevancy
to
anything
in
connection
with
collars
at
night
she
returned
home
to
her
mother
jimmie
grew
large
enough
to
take
the
vague
position
of
head
of
the
family
as
incumbent
of
that
office
he
stumbled
late
at
night
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
he
reeled
about
the
room
swearing
at
his
relations
or
went
to
sleep
on
the
floor
the
mother
had
gradually
arisen
to
that
degree
of
fame
that
she
could
bandy
words
with
her
acquaintances
among
the
called
her
by
her
first
name
when
she
appeared
they
pursued
a
course
which
had
been
theirs
for
months
they
invariably
grinned
and
cried
out
hello
mary
you
here
again
her
grey
head
wagged
in
many
a
court
she
always
besieged
the
bench
with
voluble
excuses
explanations
apologies
and
prayers
her
flaming
face
and
rolling
eyes
were
a
sort
of
familiar
sight
on
the
island
she
measured
time
by
means
of
sprees
and
was
eternally
swollen
and
dishevelled
one
day
the
young
man
pete
who
as
a
lad
had
smitten
the
devil
row
urchin
in
the
back
of
the
head
and
put
to
flight
the
antagonists
of
his
friend
jimmie
strutted
upon
the
scene
he
met
jimmie
one
day
on
the
street
promised
to
take
him
to
a
boxing
match
in
williamsburg
and
called
for
him
in
the
evening
maggie
observed
pete
he
sat
on
a
table
in
the
johnson
home
and
dangled
his
checked
legs
with
an
enticing
nonchalance
his
hair
was
curled
down
over
his
forehead
in
an
oiled
bang
his
rather
pugged
nose
seemed
to
revolt
from
contact
with
a
bristling
moustache
of
short
hairs
his
blue
coat
edged
with
black
braid
buttoned
close
to
a
red
puff
tie
and
his
shoes
looked
like
weapons
his
mannerisms
stamped
him
as
a
man
who
had
a
correct
sense
of
his
personal
superiority
there
was
valor
and
contempt
for
circumstances
in
the
glance
of
his
eye
he
waved
his
hands
like
a
man
of
the
world
who
dismisses
religion
and
philosophy
and
says
fudge
he
had
certainly
seen
everything
and
with
each
curl
of
his
lip
he
declared
that
it
amounted
to
nothing
maggie
thought
he
must
be
a
very
elegant
and
graceful
bartender
he
was
telling
tales
to
jimmie
maggie
watched
him
furtively
with
eyes
lit
with
a
vague
interest
hully

nodded
understandingly
over
his
features
played
an
eager
desire
to
state
the
amount
of
his
valor
in
a
similar
crisis
but
the
narrator

see
as
jimmie
and
his
friend
exchanged
tales
descriptive
of
their
prowess
maggie
leaned
back
in
the
shadow
her
eyes
dwelt
wonderingly
and
rather
wistfully
upon
pete
face
the
broken
furniture
grimey
walls
and
general
disorder
and
dirt
of
her
home
of
a
sudden
appeared
before
her
and
began
to
take
a
potential
aspect
pete
aristocratic
person
looked
as
if
it
might
soil
she
looked
keenly
at
him
occasionally
wondering
if
he
was
feeling
contempt
but
pete
seemed
to
be
enveloped
in
reminiscence
hully
gee
said
he
dose
mugs

phase
me
dey
knows
i
kin
wipe
up
deh
street
wid
any
of
dem
when
he
said
ah
what
deh
hell
his
voice
was
burdened
with
disdain
for
the
inevitable
and
contempt
for
anything
that
fate
might
compel
him
to
endure
maggie
perceived
that
here
was
the
beau
ideal
of
a
man
her
dim
thoughts
were
often
searching
for
far
away
lands
where
as
god
says
the
little
hills
sing
together
in
the
morning
under
the
trees
of
her
there
had
always
walked
a
lover
chapter
vi
pete
took
note
of
maggie
say
mag
i
stuck
on
yer
shape
it
outa
sight
he
said
parenthetically
with
an
affable
grin
as
he
became
aware
that
she
was
listening
closely
he
grew
still
more
eloquent
in
his
descriptions
of
various
happenings
in
his
career
it
appeared
that
he
was
invincible
in
fights
why
he
said
referring
to
a
man
with
whom
he
had
had
a
misunderstanding
dat
mug
scrapped
like
a
damn
dago
dat
right
he
was
dead
easy
see
he
he
was
a
scrapper
but
he
foun
out
hully
gee
he
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
small
room
which
seemed
then
to
grow
even
smaller
and
unfit
to
hold
his
dignity
the
attribute
of
a
supreme
warrior
that
swing
of
the
shoulders
that
had
frozen
the
timid
when
he
was
but
a
lad
had
increased
with
his
growth
and
education
at
the
ratio
of
ten
to
one
it
combined
with
the
sneer
upon
his
mouth
told
mankind
that
there
was
nothing
in
space
which
could
appall
him
maggie
marvelled
at
him
and
surrounded
him
with
greatness
she
vaguely
tried
to
calculate
the
altitude
of
the
pinnacle
from
which
he
must
have
looked
down
upon
her
i
met
a
chump
deh
odder

up

an
den
i
slugged
see
with
jimmie
in
his
company
pete
departed
in
a
sort
of
a
blaze
of
glory
from
the
johnson
home
maggie
leaning
from
the
window
watched
him
as
he
walked
down
the
street
here
was
a
formidable
man
who
disdained
the
strength
of
a
world
full
of
fists
here
was
one
who
had
contempt
for
power
one
whose
knuckles
could
defiantly
ring
against
the
granite
of
law
he
was
a
knight
the
two
men
went
from
under
the
glimmering
and
passed
into
shadows
turning
maggie
contemplated
the
dark
walls
and
the
scant
and
crude
furniture
of
her
home
a
clock
in
a
splintered
and
battered
oblong
box
of
varnished
wood
she
suddenly
regarded
as
an
abomination
she
noted
that
it
ticked
raspingly
the
almost
vanished
flowers
in
the
she
conceived
to
be
newly
hideous
some
faint
attempts
she
had
made
with
blue
ribbon
to
freshen
the
appearance
of
a
dingy
curtain
she
now
saw
to
be
piteous
she
wondered
what
pete
dined
on
she
reflected
upon
the
collar
and
cuff
factory
it
began
to
appear
to
her
mind
as
a
dreary
place
of
endless
grinding
pete
elegant
occupation
brought
him
no
doubt
into
contact
with
people
who
had
money
and
manners
it
was
probable
that
he
had
a
large
acquaintance
of
pretty
girls
he
must
have
great
sums
of
money
to
spend
to
her
the
earth
was
composed
of
hardships
and
insults
she
felt
instant
admiration
for
a
man
who
openly
defied
it
she
thought
that
if
the
grim
angel
of
death
should
clutch
his
heart
pete
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
say
oh
goes
she
anticipated
that
he
would
come
again
shortly
she
spent
some
of
her
week
pay
in
the
purchase
of
flowered
cretonne
for
a
lambrequin
she
made
it
with
infinite
care
and
hung
it
to
the
mantel
over
the
stove
in
the
kitchen
she
studied
it
with
painful
anxiety
from
different
points
in
the
room
she
wanted
it
to
look
well
on
sunday
night
when
perhaps
jimmie
friend
would
come
on
sunday
night
however
pete
did
not
appear
afterward
the
girl
looked
at
it
with
a
sense
of
humiliation
she
was
now
convinced
that
pete
was
superior
to
admiration
for
lambrequins
a
few
evenings
later
pete
entered
with
fascinating
innovations
in
his
apparel
as
she
had
seen
him
twice
and
he
had
different
suits
on
each
time
maggie
had
a
dim
impression
that
his
wardrobe
was
prodigiously
extensive
say
mag
he
said
put
on
yer
bes
duds
friday
night
an
i
take
yehs
teh
deh
show
see
he
spent
a
few
moments
in
flourishing
his
clothes
and
then
vanished
without
having
glanced
at
the
lambrequin
over
the
eternal
collars
and
cuffs
in
the
factory
maggie
spent
the
most
of
three
days
in
making
imaginary
sketches
of
pete
and
his
daily
environment
she
imagined
some
half
dozen
women
in
love
with
him
and
thought
he
must
lean
dangerously
toward
an
indefinite
one
whom
she
pictured
with
great
charms
of
person
but
with
an
altogether
contemptible
disposition
she
thought
he
must
live
in
a
blare
of
pleasure
he
had
friends
and
people
who
were
afraid
of
him
she
saw
the
golden
glitter
of
the
place
where
pete
was
to
take
her
an
entertainment
of
many
hues
and
many
melodies
where
she
was
afraid
she
might
appear
small
and
her
mother
drank
whiskey
all
friday
morning
with
lurid
face
and
tossing
hair
she
cursed
and
destroyed
furniture
all
friday
afternoon
when
maggie
came
home
at
six
her
mother
lay
asleep
amidst
the
wreck
of
chairs
and
a
table
fragments
of
various
household
utensils
were
scattered
about
the
floor
she
had
vented
some
phase
of
drunken
fury
upon
the
lambrequin
it
lay
in
a
bedraggled
heap
in
the
corner
hah
she
snorted
sitting
up
suddenly
where
deh
hell

a

when
pete
arrived
maggie
in
a
worn
black
dress
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
midst
of
a
floor
strewn
with
wreckage
the
curtain
at
the
window
had
been
pulled
by
a
heavy
hand
and
hung
by
one
tack
dangling
to
and
fro
in
the
draft
through
the
cracks
at
the
sash
the
knots
of
blue
ribbons
appeared
like
violated
flowers
the
fire
in
the
stove
had
gone
out
the
displaced
lids
and
open
doors
showed
heaps
of
sullen
grey
ashes
the
remnants
of
a
meal
ghastly
like
dead
flesh
lay
in
a
corner
maggie
red
mother
stretched
on
the
floor
blasphemed
and
gave
her
daughter
a
bad
name
chapter
vii
an
orchestra
of
yellow
silk
women
and
men
on
an
elevated
stage
near
the
centre
of
a
great
hall
played
a
popular
waltz
the
place
was
crowded
with
people
grouped
about
little
tables
a
battalion
of
waiters
slid
among
the
throng
carrying
trays
of
beer
glasses
and
making
change
from
the
inexhaustible
vaults
of
their
trousers
pockets
little
boys
in
the
costumes
of
french
chefs
paraded
up
and
down
the
irregular
aisles
vending
fancy
cakes
there
was
a
low
rumble
of
conversation
and
a
subdued
clinking
of
glasses
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
rolled
and
wavered
high
in
air
about
the
dull
gilt
of
the
chandeliers
the
vast
crowd
had
an
air
throughout
of
having
just
quitted
labor
men
with
calloused
hands
and
attired
in
garments
that
showed
the
wear
of
an
endless
trudge
for
a
living
smoked
their
pipes
contentedly
and
spent
five
ten
or
perhaps
fifteen
cents
for
beer
there
was
a
mere
sprinkling
of
men
who
smoked
cigars
purchased
elsewhere
the
great
body
of
the
crowd
was
composed
of
people
who
showed
that
all
day
they
strove
with
their
hands
quiet
germans
with
maybe
their
wives
and
two
or
three
children
sat
listening
to
the
music
with
the
expressions
of
happy
cows
an
occasional
party
of
sailors
from
a
their
faces
pictures
of
sturdy
health
spent
the
earlier
hours
of
the
evening
at
the
small
round
tables
very
infrequent
tipsy
men
swollen
with
the
value
of
their
opinions
engaged
their
companions
in
earnest
and
confidential
conversation
in
the
balcony
and
here
and
there
below
shone
the
impassive
faces
of
women
the
nationalities
of
the
bowery
beamed
upon
the
stage
from
all
directions
pete
aggressively
walked
up
a
side
aisle
and
took
seats
with
maggie
at
a
table
beneath
the
balcony
two
beehs
leaning
back
he
regarded
with
eyes
of
superiority
the
scene
before
them
this
attitude
affected
maggie
strongly
a
man
who
could
regard
such
a
sight
with
indifference
must
be
accustomed
to
very
great
things
it
was
obvious
that
pete
had
been
to
this
place
many
times
before
and
was
very
familiar
with
it
a
knowledge
of
this
fact
made
maggie
feel
little
and
new
he
was
extremely
gracious
and
attentive
he
displayed
the
consideration
of
a
cultured
gentleman
who
knew
what
was
due
say
what
deh
hell
bring
deh
lady
a
big
glass
what
deh
hell
use
is
dat
pony
do
be
fresh
now
said
the
waiter
with
some
warmth
as
he
departed
ah
git
off
deh
eart
said
pete
after
the
other
retreating
form
maggie
perceived
that
pete
brought
forth
all
his
elegance
and
all
his
knowledge
of
customs
for
her
benefit
her
heart
warmed
as
she
reflected
upon
his
condescension
the
orchestra
of
yellow
silk
women
and
men
gave
vent
to
a
few
bars
of
anticipatory
music
and
a
girl
in
a
pink
dress
with
short
skirts
galloped
upon
the
stage
she
smiled
upon
the
throng
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
a
warm
welcome
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
making
profuse
gesticulations
and
singing
in
brazen
soprano
tones
a
song
the
words
of
which
were
inaudible
when
she
broke
into
the
swift
rattling
measures
of
a
chorus
some
men
near
the
stage
joined
in
the
rollicking
refrain
and
glasses
were
pounded
rhythmically
upon
the
tables
people
leaned
forward
to
watch
her
and
to
try
to
catch
the
words
of
the
song
when
she
vanished
there
were
long
rollings
of
applause
obedient
to
more
anticipatory
bars
she
reappeared
amidst
the
cheering
of
the
tipsy
men
the
orchestra
plunged
into
dance
music
and
the
laces
of
the
dancer
fluttered
and
flew
in
the
glare
of
gas
jets
she
divulged
the
fact
that
she
was
attired
in
some
half
dozen
skirts
it
was
patent
that
any
one
of
them
would
have
proved
adequate
for
the
purpose
for
which
skirts
are
intended
an
occasional
man
bent
forward
intent
upon
the
pink
stockings
maggie
wondered
at
the
splendor
of
the
costume
and
lost
herself
in
calculations
of
the
cost
of
the
silks
and
laces
the
dancer
smile
of
stereotyped
enthusiasm
was
turned
for
ten
minutes
upon
the
faces
of
her
audience
in
the
finale
she
fell
into
some
of
those
grotesque
attitudes
which
were
at
the
time
popular
among
the
dancers
in
the
theatres
giving
to
the
bowery
public
the
phantasies
of
the
aristocratic
public
at
reduced
rates
say
pete
said
maggie
leaning
forward
dis
is
great
sure
said
pete
with
proper
complacence
a
ventriloquist
followed
the
dancer
he
held
two
fantastic
dolls
on
his
knees
he
made
them
sing
mournful
ditties
and
say
funny
things
about
geography
and
ireland
do
dose
little
men
talk
asked
maggie
naw
said
pete
it
some
damn
fake
see
two
girls
on
the
bills
as
sisters
came
forth
and
sang
a
duet
that
is
heard
occasionally
at
concerts
given
under
church
auspices
they
supplemented
it
with
a
dance
which
of
course
can
never
be
seen
at
concerts
given
under
church
auspices
after
the
duettists
had
retired
a
woman
of
debatable
age
sang
a
negro
melody
the
chorus
necessitated
some
grotesque
waddlings
supposed
to
be
an
imitation
of
a
plantation
darkey
under
the
influence
probably
of
music
and
the
moon
the
audience
was
just
enthusiastic
enough
over
it
to
have
her
return
and
sing
a
sorrowful
lay
whose
lines
told
of
a
mother
love
and
a
sweetheart
who
waited
and
a
young
man
who
was
lost
at
sea
under
the
most
harrowing
circumstances
from
the
faces
of
a
score
or
so
in
the
crowd
the
look
faded
many
heads
were
bent
forward
with
eagerness
and
sympathy
as
the
last
distressing
sentiment
of
the
piece
was
brought
forth
it
was
greeted
by
that
kind
of
applause
which
rings
as
sincere
as
a
final
effort
the
singer
rendered
some
verses
which
described
a
vision
of
britain
being
annihilated
by
america
and
ireland
bursting
her
bonds
a
carefully
prepared
crisis
was
reached
in
the
last
line
of
the
last
verse
where
the
singer
threw
out
her
arms
and
cried
the
banner
instantly
a
great
cheer
swelled
from
the
throats
of
the
assemblage
of
the
masses
there
was
a
heavy
rumble
of
booted
feet
thumping
the
floor
eyes
gleamed
with
sudden
fire
and
calloused
hands
waved
frantically
in
the
air
after
a
few
moments
rest
the
orchestra
played
crashingly
and
a
small
fat
man
burst
out
upon
the
stage
he
began
to
roar
a
song
and
stamp
back
and
forth
before
the
wildly
waving
a
glossy
silk
hat
and
throwing
leers
or
smiles
broadcast
he
made
his
face
into
fantastic
grimaces
until
he
looked
like
a
pictured
devil
on
a
japanese
kite
the
crowd
laughed
gleefully
his
short
fat
legs
were
never
still
a
moment
he
shouted
and
roared
and
bobbed
his
shock
of
red
wig
until
the
audience
broke
out
in
excited
applause
pete
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
progress
of
events
upon
the
stage
he
was
drinking
beer
and
watching
maggie
her
cheeks
were
blushing
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
were
glistening
she
drew
deep
breaths
of
pleasure
no
thoughts
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
collar
and
cuff
factory
came
to
her
when
the
orchestra
crashed
finally
they
jostled
their
way
to
the
sidewalk
with
the
crowd
pete
took
maggie
arm
and
pushed
a
way
for
her
offering
to
fight
with
a
man
or
two
they
reached
maggie
home
at
a
late
hour
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
front
of
the
gruesome
doorway

into

up

and
smiled
at

walked
slowly
down
the
street
he
had
something
of

upon

her

she
began
to
note
with
more
interest
the
women
she
met
on
the
avenues
she
envied
elegance
and
soft
palms
she
craved
those
adornments
of
person
which
she
saw
every
day
on
the
street
conceiving
them
to
be
allies
of
vast
importance
to
women
studying
faces
she
thought
many
of
the
women
and
girls
she
chanced
to
meet
smiled
with
serenity

forever
cherished
and
watched
over
by

her
she
knew
she
was
gradually
and
surely
shrivelling
in
the
hot
stuffy
room
the
begrimed
windows
rattled
incessantly
from
the
passing
of
elevated
trains
the
place
was
filled
with
a
whirl
of
noises
and
odors
she
wondered
as
she
regarded
some
of
the
grizzled
women
in
the
room
mere
mechanical
contrivances
sewing
seams
and
grinding
out
with
heads
bended
over
their
work
tales
of
imagined
or
real
girlhood
happiness
past
drunks
the
baby
at
home
and
unpaid
wages
she
speculated
how
long
her
youth
would
endure
she
began
to
see
the
bloom
upon
her
cheeks
as
valuable
she
imagined
herself
in
an
exasperating
future
as
a
scrawny
woman
with
an
eternal
grievance
too
she
thought
pete
to
be
a
very
fastidious
person
concerning
the
appearance
of
women
she
felt
she
would
love
to
see
somebody
entangle
their
fingers
in
the
oily
beard
of
the
fat
foreigner
who
owned
the
establishment
he
was
a
detestable
creature
he
wore
white
socks
with
low
shoes
he
sat
all
day
delivering
orations
in
the
depths
of
a
cushioned
chair
his

raking
his

for
amusement
discovered
the
central
park
menagerie
and
the
museum
of
arts
sunday
afternoons
would
sometimes
find
them
at
these
places
pete
did
not
appear
to
be
particularly
interested
in
what
he
saw
he
stood
around
looking
heavy
while
maggie
giggled
in
glee
once
at
the
menagerie
he
went
into
a
trance
of
admiration
before
the
spectacle
of
a
very
small
monkey
threatening
to
thrash
a
cageful
because
one
of
them
had
pulled
his
tail
and
he
had
not
wheeled
about
quickly
enough
to
discover
who
did
it
ever
after
pete
knew
that
monkey
by
sight
and
winked
at
him
trying
to
induce
hime
to
fight
with
other
and
larger
monkeys
at
the

maggie
said

said
pete
wait
next
summer
an

yehs
to
a
picnic
while
the
girl
wandered
in
the
vaulted
rooms
pete
occupied
himself
in
returning
stony
stare
for
stony
stare
the
appalling
scrutiny
of
the
of
the
treasures
occasionally
he
would
remark
in
loud
tones
dat
jay
has
got
glass
eyes
and
sentences
of
the
sort
when
he
tired
of
this
amusement
he
would
go
to
the
mummies
and
moralize
over
them
usually
he
submitted
with
silent
dignity
to
all
which
he
had
to
go
through
but
at
times
he
was
goaded
into
comment
what

demanded

during

he
took
her
to
see
plays
in
which
the
heroine
was
rescued
from
the
palatial
home
of
her
guardian
who
is
cruelly
after
her
bonds
by
the
hero
with
the
beautiful
sentiments
the
latter
spent
most
of
his
time
out
at
soak
in
snow
storms
busy
with
a
revolver
rescuing
aged
strangers
from
villains
maggie
lost
herself
in
sympathy
with
the
wanderers
swooning
in
snow
storms
beneath
church
windows
and
a
choir
within
singing
joy
to
the
world
to
maggie
and
the
rest
of
the
audience
this
was
transcendental
realism
joy
always
within
and
they
like
the
actor
inevitably
without
viewing
it
they
hugged
themselves
in
ecstatic
pity
of
their
imagined
or
real
condition
the
girl
thought
the
arrogance
and
of
the
magnate
of
the
play
was
very
accurately
drawn
she
echoed
the
maledictions
that
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
showered
on
this
individual
when
his
lines
compelled
him
to
expose
his
extreme
selfishness
shady
persons
in
the
audience
revolted
from
the
pictured
villainy
of
the
drama
with
untiring
zeal
they
hissed
vice
and
applauded
virtue
unmistakably
bad
men
evinced
an
apparently
sincere
admiration
for
virtue
the
loud
gallery
was
overwhelmingly
with
the
unfortunate
and
the
oppressed
they
encouraged
the
struggling
hero
with
cries
and
jeered
the
villain
hooting
and
calling
attention
to
his
whiskers
when
anybody
died
in
the
snow
storms
the
gallery
mourned
they
sought
out
the
painted
misery
and
hugged
it
as
akin
in
the
hero
erratic
march
from
poverty
in
the
first
act
to
wealth
and
triumph
in
the
final
one
in
which
he
forgives
all
the
enemies
that
he
has
left
he
was
assisted
by
the
gallery
which
applauded
his
generous
and
noble
sentiments
and
confounded
the
speeches
of
his
opponents
by
making
irrelevant
but
very
sharp
remarks
those
actors
who
were
cursed
with
villainy
parts
were
confronted
at
every
turn
by
the
gallery
if
one
of
them
rendered
lines
containing
the
most
subtile
distinctions
between
right
and
wrong
the
gallery
was
immediately
aware
if
the
actor
meant
wickedness
and
denounced
him
accordingly
the
last
act
was
a
triumph
for
the
hero
poor
and
of
the
masses
the
representative
of
the
audience
over
the
villain
and
the
rich
man
his
pockets
stuffed
with
bonds
his
heart
packed
with
tyrannical
purposes
imperturbable
amid
suffering
maggie
always
departed
with
raised
spirits
from
the
showing
places
of
the
melodrama
she
rejoiced
at
the
way
in
which
the
poor
and
virtuous
eventually
surmounted
the
wealthy
and
wicked
the
theatre
made
her
think
she
wondered
if
the
culture
and
refinement
she
had
seen
imitated
perhaps
grotesquely
by
the
heroine
on
the
stage
could
be
acquired
by
a
girl
who
lived
in
a
tenement
house
and
worked
in
a

a
group
of
urchins

gleamed
from
their

they
were
twisting
their
fingers
in
excitement
here
she

yelled
one
of
them
suddenly
the
group
of
urchins
burst
instantly
asunder
and
its
individual
fragments
were
spread
in
a
wide
respectable
half
circle
about
the
point
of
interest
the
saloon
door
opened
with
a
crash
and
the
figure
of
a
woman
appeared
upon
the
threshold
her
grey
hair
fell
in
knotted
masses
about
her
shoulders
her
face
was
crimsoned
and
wet
with
perspiration
her
eyes
had
a
rolling
glare

the
door
received
a
kick
of
exasperation
from
within
and
the
woman
lurched
heavily
out
on
the
sidewalk
the
gamins
in
the
became
violently
agitated
they
began
to
dance
about
and
hoot
and
yell
and
jeer
wide
dirty
grins
spread
over
each
face
the
woman
made
a
furious
dash
at
a
particularly
outrageous
cluster
of
little
boys
they
laughed
delightedly
and
scampered
off
a
short
distance
calling
out
over
their
shoulders
to
her
she
stood
tottering
on
the
and
thundered
at
them
yeh
devil
kids
she
howled
shaking
red
fists
the
little
boys
whooped
in
glee
as
she
started
up
the
street
they
fell
in
behind
and
marched
uproariously
occasionally
she
wheeled
about
and
made
charges
on
them
they
ran
nimbly
out
of
reach
and
taunted
her
in
the
frame
of
a
gruesome
doorway
she
stood
for
a
moment
cursing
them
her
hair
straggled
giving
her
crimson
features
a
look
of
insanity
her
great
fists
quivered
as
she
shook
them
madly
in
the
air
the
urchins
made
terrific
noises
until
she
turned
and
disappeared
then
they
filed
quietly
in
the
way
they
had
come
the
woman
floundered
about
in
the
lower
hall
of
the
tenement
house
and
finally
stumbled
up
the
stairs
on
an
upper
hall
a
door
was
opened
and
a
collection
of
heads
peered
curiously
out
watching
her
with
a
wrathful
snort
the
woman
confronted
the
door
but
it
was
slammed
hastily
in
her
face
and
the
key
was
turned
she
stood
for
a
few
minutes
delivering
a
frenzied
challenge
at
the
panels

she
began
to
kick
the
door
with
her
great
feet
she
shrilly
defied
the
universe
to
appear
and
do
battle
her
cursing
trebles
brought
heads
from
all
doors
save
the
one
she
threatened
her
eyes
glared
in
every
direction
the
air
was
full
of
her

up
from

upon
her
children

an
idea

common
courtesy
for
a

was
not

how
much

about

rules
of

the
following
night
he
returned
home
from
work
at
rather
a
late
hour
in
the
evening
in
passing
through
the
halls
he
came
upon
the
gnarled
and
leathery
old
woman
who
possessed
the
music
box
she
was
grinning
in
the
dim
light
that
drifted
through
panes
she
beckoned
to
him
with
a
smudged
forefinger

there

repaired
by
an

uncertainly
upon

been
restored
to
the
curtains
and
the
lambrequin
with
its
immense
sheaves
of
yellow
wheat

from

behind

jimmie
walked
to
the
window
and
began
to
look
through
the
blurred
glass
it
occurred
to
him
to
vaguely
wonder
for
an
instant
if
some
of
the
women
of

however
he
began
to
swear
but
he

at
the

his

sat
down
in
a
chair
but
a
moment
later
sprang
erect
and
delivered
a
maddened
whirl
of
oaths
her
son
turned
to
look
at
her
as
she
reeled
and
swayed
in
the
middle
of

convulsed
with

upon

the

of

saloon
called
seductively
to
passengers
to

and
annihilate

the

was
papered
in

of
imitation

of
counterfeit
massiveness
extended
down
the

a

reached

to

across
from

a
smaller
counter
held
a
collection
of
plates
upon
which
swarmed
frayed
fragments
of
crackers
slices
of
boiled
ham
dishevelled
bits
of
cheese
and

crashed
against

unsteadily

belligerently
toward

bended
his

sideways
as

assiduously
polished
away
with
a
napkin
at
the
gleaming
wood
he
had
a
look
of
watchfulness
upon

jimmie
and
his

upon

cried
the
two
men
in
chorus
the
glare
of
a
panther
came
into
pete
eyes
dat
what
i
said
unnerstan
he
came
through
a
passage
at
the
end
of
the
bar
and
swelled
down
upon
the
two
men
they
stepped
promptly
forward
and
crowded
close
to
him
they
bristled
like
three
roosters
they
moved
their
heads
pugnaciously
and
kept
their
shoulders
braced
the
nervous
muscles
about
each
mouth
twitched
with
a
forced
smile
of
mockery
well

jimmie

stepped
warily
back
waving
his
hands
before
him
to
keep
the
men
from
coming
too
near
well
what
deh

repeated
jimmie
ally
they
kept
close
to
him
taunting
and
leering
they
strove
to
make
him
attempt
the
initial
blow
keep
back
now
don
crowd
me
ominously
said
pete
again
they
chorused
in
contempt
oh
hell
in
a
small
tossing
group
the
three
men
edged
for
positions
like
frigates
contemplating
battle
well
why
deh
hell
don
yeh
try
teh
us
out
cried
jimmie
and
his
ally
with
copious
sneers
the
bravery
of
sat
upon
the
faces
of
the
men
their
clenched
fists
moved
like
eager
weapons
the
allied
two
jostled
the
bartender
elbows
glaring
at
him
with
feverish
eyes
and
forcing
him
toward
the
wall
suddenly
pete
swore
redly
the
flash
of
action
gleamed
from
his
eyes
he
threw
back
his
arm
and
aimed
a
tremendous
blow
at
jimmie
face
his
foot
swung
a
step
forward
and
the
weight
of
his
body
was
behind
his
fist
jimmie
ducked
his
head
with
the
quickness
of
a
cat
the
fierce
answering
blows
of
him
and
his
ally
crushed
on
pete
bowed
head
the
quiet
stranger
vanished
the
arms
of
the
combatants
whirled
in
the
air
like
flails
the
faces
of
the
men
at
first
flushed
to
anger
now
began
to
fade
to
the
pallor
of
warriors
in
the
blood
and
heat
of
a
battle
their
lips
curled
back
and
stretched
tightly
over
the
gums
in
grins
through
their
white
gripped
teeth
struggled
hoarse
whisperings
of
oaths
their
eyes
glittered
with
murderous
fire
each
head
was
huddled
between
its
owner
shoulders
and
arms
were
swinging
with
marvelous
rapidity
feet
scraped
to
and
fro
with
a
loud
scratching
sound
upon
the
sanded
floor
blows
left
crimson
blotches
upon
pale
skin
the
curses
of
the
first
quarter
minute
of
the
fight
died
away
the
breaths
of
the
fighters
came
wheezingly
from
their
lips
and
the
three
chests
were
straining
and
heaving
pete
at
intervals
gave
vent
to
low
labored
hisses
that
sounded
like
a
desire
to
kill
jimmie
ally
gibbered
at
times
like
a
wounded
maniac
jimmie
was
silent
fighting
with
the
face
of
a
sacrificial
priest
the
rage
of
fear
shone
in
all
their
eyes
and
their
fists
swirled
at
a
tottering
moment
a
blow
from
pete
hand
struck
the
ally
and
he
crashed
to
the
floor
he
wriggled
instantly
to
his
feet
and
grasping
the
quiet
stranger
beer
glass
from
the
bar
hurled
it
at
pete
head
high
on
the
wall
it
burst
like
a
bomb
shivering
fragments
flying
in
all
directions
then
missiles
came
to
every
man
hand
the
place
had
heretofore
appeared
free
of
things
to
throw
but
suddenly
glass
and
bottles
went
singing
through
the
air
they
were
thrown
point
blank
at
bobbing
heads
the
pyramid
of
shimmering
glasses
that
had
never
been
disturbed
changed
to
cascades
as
heavy
bottles
were
flung
into
them
mirrors
splintered
to
nothing
the
three
frothing
creatures
on
the
floor
buried
themselves
in
a
frenzy
for
blood
there
followed
in
the
wake
of
missiles
and
fists
some
unknown
prayers
perhaps
for
death
the
quiet
stranger
had
sprawled
very
pyrotechnically
out
on
the
sidewalk
a
laugh
ran
up
and
down
the
avenue
for
the
half
of
a
block
dey
trowed
a
bloke
inteh
deh
street
people
heard
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
shuffling
feet
within
the
saloon
and
came
running
a
small
group
bending
down
to
look
under
the
bamboo
doors
watching
the
fall
of
glass
and
three
pairs
of
violent
legs
changed
in
a
moment
to
a
crowd
a
policeman
came
charging
down
the
sidewalk
and
bounced
through
the
doors
into
the
saloon
the
crowd
bended
and
surged
in
absorbing
anxiety
to
see
jimmie
caught
first
sight
of
the
interruption
on
his
feet
he
had
the
same
regard
for
a
policeman
that
when
on
his
truck
he
had
for
a
fire
engine
he
howled
and
ran
for
the
side
door
the
officer
made
a
terrific
advance
club
in
hand
one
comprehensive
sweep
of
the
long
night
stick
threw
the
ally
to
the
floor
and
forced
pete
to
a
corner
with
his
disengaged
hand
he
made
a
furious
effort
at
jimmie
then
he
regained
his
balance
and
paused
well
well
you
are
a
pair
of
pictures
what
in
hell
yeh
been
up
to
jimmie
with
his
face
drenched
in
blood
escaped
up
a
side
street
pursued
a
short
distance
by
some
of
the
more
or
excited
individuals
of
the
crowd
later
from
a
corner
safely
dark
he
saw
the
policeman
the
ally
and
the
bartender
emerge
from
the
saloon
pete
locked
the
doors
and
then
followed
up
the
avenue
in
the
rear
of
the
policeman
and
his
charge
on
first
thoughts
jimmie
with
his
heart
throbbing
at
battle
heat
started
to
go
desperately
to
the
rescue
of
his
friend
but
he
halted
ah
what
deh
hell
he
demanded
of
himself
chapter
xii
in
a
hall
of
irregular
shape
sat
pete
and
maggie
drinking
beer
a
submissive
orchestra
dictated
to
by
a
spectacled
man
with
frowsy
hair
and
a
dress
suit
industriously
followed
the
bobs
of
his
head
and
the
waves
of
his
baton
a
ballad
singer
in
a
dress
of
flaming
scarlet
sang
in
the
inevitable
voice
of
brass
when
she
vanished
men
seated
at
the
tables
near
the
front
applauded
loudly
pounding
the
polished
wood
with
their
beer
glasses
she
returned
attired
in
less
gown
and
sang
again
she
received
another
enthusiastic
encore
she
reappeared
in
still
less
gown
and
danced
the
deafening
rumble
of
glasses
and
clapping
of
hands
that
followed
her
exit
indicated
an
overwhelming
desire
to
have
her
come
on
for
the
fourth
time
but
the
curiosity
of
the
audience
was
not
gratified
maggie
was
pale
from
her
eyes
had
been
plucked
all
look
of
she
leaned
with
a
dependent
air
toward
her
companion
she
was
timid
as
if
fearing
his
anger
or
displeasure
she
seemed
to
beseech
tenderness
of
him
pete
air
of
distinguished
valor
had
grown
upon
him
until
it
threatened
stupendous
dimensions
he
was
infinitely
gracious
to
the
girl
it
was
apparent
to
her
that
his
condescension
was
a
marvel
he
could
appear
to
strut
even
while
sitting
still
and
he
showed
that
he
was
a
lion
of
lordly
characteristics
by
the
air
with
which
he
spat
with
maggie
gazing
at
him
wonderingly
he
took
pride
in
commanding
the
waiters
who
were
however
indifferent
or
deaf
hi
you
git
a
russle
on
yehs
what
deh
hell
yehs
lookin
at
two
more
beehs
hear
he
leaned
back
and
critically
regarded
the
person
of
a
girl
with
a
wig
who
upon
the
stage
was
flinging
her
heels
in
somewhat
awkward
imitation
of
a
danseuse
at
times
maggie
told
pete
long
confidential
tales
of
her
former
home
life
dwelling
upon
the
escapades
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
and
the
difficulties
she
had
to
combat
in
order
to
obtain
a
degree
of
comfort
he
responded
in
tones
of
philanthropy
he
pressed
her
arm
with
an
air
of
reassuring
proprietorship
dey
was
damn
jays
he
said
denouncing
the
mother
and
brother
the
sound
of
the
music
which
by
the
efforts
of
the
leader
drifted
to
her
ears
through
the
atmosphere
made
the
girl
dream
she
thought
of
her
former
rum
alley
environment
and
turned
to
regard
pete
strong
protecting
fists
she
thought
of
the
collar
and
cuff
manufactory
and
the
eternal
moan
of
the
proprietor
what
een
hell
do
you
sink
i
pie
fife
dolla
a
week
for
play
no
py
damn
she
contemplated
pete
eyes
and
noted
that
wealth
and
prosperity
was
indicated
by
his
clothes
she
imagined
a
future
because
of
its
distance
from
all
that
she
previously
had
experienced
as
to
the
present
she
perceived
only
vague
reasons
to
be
miserable
her
life
was
pete
and
she
considered
him
worthy
of
the
charge
she
would
be
disturbed
by
no
particular
apprehensions
so
long
as
pete
adored
her
as
he
now
said
he
did
she
did
not
feel
like
a
bad
woman
to
her
knowledge
she
had
never
seen
any
better
at
times
men
at
other
tables
regarded
the
girl
furtively
pete
aware
of
it
nodded
at
her
and
grinned
he
felt
proud
mag
yer
a
bloomin
he
remarked
studying
her
face
through
the
haze
the
men
made
maggie
fear
but
she
blushed
at
words
as
it
became
apparent
to
her
that
she
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
men
wonderfully
pathetic
in
their
dissipation
stared
at
her
through
clouds
boys
some
of
them
with
faces
of
stone
and
mouths
of
sin
not
nearly
so
pathetic
as
the
grey
heads
tried
to
find
the
girl
eyes
in
the
smoke
wreaths
maggie
considered
she
was
not
what
they
thought
her
she
confined
her
glances
to
pete
and
the
stage
the
orchestra
played
negro
melodies
and
a
versatile
drummer
pounded
whacked
clattered
and
scratched
on
a
dozen
machines
to
make
noise
those
glances
of
the
men
shot
at
maggie
from
under
lids
made
her
tremble
she
thought
them
all
to
be
worse
men
than
pete
come
let
go
she
said
as
they
went
out
maggie
perceived
two
women
seated
at
a
table
with
some
men
they
were
painted
and
their
cheeks
had
lost
their
roundness
as
she
passed
them
the
girl
with
a
shrinking
movement
drew
back
her
skirts
chapter
xiii
jimmie
did
not
return
home
for
a
number
of
days
after
the
fight
with
pete
in
the
saloon
when
he
did
he
approached
with
extreme
caution
he
found
his
mother
raving
maggie
had
not
returned
home
the
parent
continually
wondered
how
her
daughter
could
come
to
such
a
pass
she
had
never
considered
maggie
as
a
pearl
dropped
unstained
into
rum
alley
from
heaven
but
she
could
not
conceive
how
it
was
possible
for
her
daughter
to
fall
so
low
as
to
bring
disgrace
upon
her
family
she
was
terrific
in
denunciation
of
the
girl
wickedness
the
fact
that
the
neighbors
talked
of
it
maddened
her
when
women
came
in
and
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
casually
asked
where
maggie
dese
days
the
mother
shook
her
fuzzy
head
at
them
and
appalled
them
with
curses
cunning
hints
inviting
confidence
she
rebuffed
with
violence
an
wid
all
deh
bringin
up
she
had
how
could
she
moaningly
she
asked
of
her

jimmie
was
transfixed
by
these
questions
he
could
not
conceive
how
under
the
circumstances
his
mother
daughter
and
his
sister
could
have
been
so
wicked
his
mother
took
a
drink
from
a
squdgy
bottle
that
sat
on
the
table
she
continued
her
lament
she
had
a
bad
heart
dat

did
jimmie
she

wicked
teh

an
we

nodded
again

cried
the
mother
raising
her
eyes
one
day
jimmie
came
home
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
began
to
wriggle
about
with
a
new
and
strange
nervousness
at
last
he
spoke
shamefacedly
well

queers

if

well
i
i

if

fetched

home
an
the
mother
started
from
her
chair
and
broke
forth
into
a
storm
of
passionate
anger
what

i

said
jimmie
for
a
time
they
sat
in
silence
the
mother
eyes
gloated
on
a
scene
her
imagination
could
call
before
her
her
lips
were
set
in
a
vindictive
smile

of
the
daughter

jimmie
thought
he
had
a
great
idea
of
women
frailty
but
he
could
not
understand
why
any
of
his
kin
should
be
victims
damn
her
he
fervidly
said
again
he
wondered
vaguely
if
some
of
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
had
brothers
nevertheless
his
mind
did
not
for
an
instant
confuse
himself
with
those
brothers
nor
his
sister
with
theirs
after
the
mother
had
with
great
difficulty
suppressed
the
neighbors
she
went
among
them
and
proclaimed
her
grief
may
gawd
forgive
dat
girl
was
her
continual
cry
to
attentive
ears
she
recited
the
whole
length
and
breadth
of

she

deh
first
chance

got
may
gawd
forgive
her
when
arrested
for
drunkenness
she
used
the
story
of
her
downfall
with
telling
effect
upon
the
police
justices
finally
one
of
them
said
to
her
peering
down
over
his
spectacles
mary
the
records
of
this
and
other
courts
show
that
you
are
the
mother
of
daughters
who
have
been
ruined
the
case
is
unparalleled
in
the
annals
of
this
court
and
this
court
thinks
the
mother
went
through
life
shedding
large
tears
of
sorrow
her
red
face
was
a
picture
of
agony
of
course
jimmie
publicly
damned
his
sister
that
he
might
appear
on
a
higher
social
plane
but
arguing
with
himself
stumbling
about
in
ways
that
he
knew
not
he
once
almost
came
to
a
conclusion
that
his
sister
would
have
been
more
firmly
good
had
she
better
known
why
however
he
felt
that
he
could
not
hold
such
a
view
he
threw
it
hastily
aside
chapter
xiv
in
a
hilarious
hall
there
were
tables
and
women
and
a
crowd
of
smoking
men
valiant
noise
was
made
on
a
stage
at
the
end
of
the
hall
by
an
orchestra
composed
of
men
who
looked
as
if
they
had
just
happened
in
soiled
waiters
ran
to
and
fro
swooping
down
like
hawks
on
the
unwary
in
the
throng
clattering
along
the
aisles
with
trays
covered
with
glasses
stumbling
over
women
skirts
and
charging
two
prices
for
everything
but
beer
all
with
a
swiftness
that
blurred
the
view
of
the
cocoanut
palms
and
dusty
monstrosities
painted
upon
the
walls
of
the
room
a
bouncer
with
an
immense
load
of
business
upon
his
hands
plunged
about
in
the
crowd
dragging
bashful
strangers
to
prominent
chairs
ordering
waiters
here
and
there
and
quarreling
furiously
with
men
who
wanted
to
sing
with
the
orchestra
the
usual
smoke
cloud
was
present
but
so
dense
that
heads
and
arms
seemed
entangled
in
it
the
rumble
of
conversation
was
replaced
by
a
roar
plenteous
oaths
heaved
through
the
air
the
room
rang
with
the
shrill
voices
of
women
bubbling
with
the
chief
element
in
the
music
of
the
orchestra
was
speed
the
musicians
played
in
intent
fury
a
woman
was
singing
and
smiling
upon
the
stage
but
no
one
took
notice
of
her
the
rate
at
which
the
piano
cornet
and
violins
were
going
seemed
to
impart
wildness
to
the
crowd
beer
glasses
were
emptied
at
a
gulp
and
conversation
became
a
rapid
chatter
the
smoke
eddied
and
swirled
like
a
shadowy
river
hurrying
toward
some
unseen
falls
pete
and
maggie
entered
the
hall
and
took
chairs
at
a
table
near
the
door
the
woman
who
was
seated
there
made
an
attempt
to
occupy
pete
attention
and
failing
went
away
three
weeks
had
passed
since
the
girl
had
left
home
the
air
of
dependence
had
been
magnified
and
showed
its
direct
effect
in
the
peculiar
and
ease
of
pete
ways
toward
her
she
followed
pete
eyes
with
hers
anticipating
with
smiles
gracious
looks
from
him
a
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
accompanied
by
a
mere
boy
came
into
the
place
and
took
seats
near
them
at
once
pete
sprang
to
his
feet
his
face
beaming
with
glad
surprise
by
gawd
there
nellie
he
cried
he
went
over
to
the
table
and
held
out
an
eager
hand
to
the
woman
why
hello
pete
me
boy
how
are
you
said
she
giving
him
her
fingers
maggie
took
instant
note
of
the
woman
she
perceived
that
her
black
dress
fitted
her
to
perfection
her
linen
collar
and
cuffs
were
spotless
tan
gloves
were
stretched
over
her
hands
a
hat
of
a
prevailing
fashion
perched
jauntily
upon
her
dark
hair
she
wore
no
jewelry
and
was
painted
with
no
apparent
paint
she
looked
through
the
stares
of
the
men
sit
down
and
call
your
over
she
said
cordially
to
pete
at
his
beckoning
maggie
came
and
sat
between
pete
and
the
mere
boy
i
thought
yeh
were
gone
away
fer
good
began
pete
at
once
when
did
yeh
git
back
how
did
dat
turn
out
the
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
well
he
did
have
as
many
stamps
as
he
tried
to
make
out
so
i
shook
him
that
all
well
i
glad
teh
see
yehs
back
in
deh
city
said
pete
with
awkward
gallantry
he
and
the
woman
entered
into
a
long
conversation
exchanging
reminiscences
of
days
together
maggie
sat
still
unable
to
formulate
an
intelligent
sentence
upon
the
conversation
and
painfully
aware
of
it
she
saw
pete
eyes
sparkle
as
he
gazed
upon
the
handsome
stranger
he
listened
smilingly
to
all
she
said
the
woman
was
familiar
with
all
his
affairs
asked
him
about
mutual
friends
and
knew
the
amount
of
his
salary
she
paid
no
attention
to
maggie
looking
toward
her
once
or
twice
and
apparently
seeing
the
wall
beyond
the
mere
boy
was
sulky
in
the
beginning
he
had
welcomed
with
acclamations
the
additions
let
all
have
a
drink
what
you
take
nell
and
you
miss
have
a
drink
you
i
mean
he
had
shown
a
sprightly
desire
to
do
the
talking
for
the
company
and
tell
all
about
his
family
in
a
loud
voice
he
declaimed
on
various
topics
he
assumed
a
patronizing
air
toward
pete
as
maggie
was
silent
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
he
made
a
great
show
of
lavishing
wealth
upon
the
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
do
keep
still
freddie
you
gibber
like
an
ape

said
the
woman
to
him
she
turned
away
and
devoted
her
attention
to
pete

you
know
you

merely
because
you
would
come
that
all
there
is
of
it
to
pete
visible
distress
she
turned
to
the
mere
boy
bringing
him
speedily
from
a
terrific
rage
he
had
been
debating
whether
it
would
be
the
part
of
a
man
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
pete
or
would
he
be
justified
in
striking
him
savagely
with
his
beer
glass
without
warning
but
he
recovered
himself
when
the
woman
turned
to
renew
her
smilings
he
beamed
upon
her
with
an
expression
that
was
somewhat
tipsy
and
inexpressibly
tender
say
shake
that
bowery
jay
requested
he
in
a
loud
whisper
freddie

replied
pete

touched

he
spoke
in
tones
of
injury
why
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
interested
in
your
explanations
said
the
woman
with
a
coldness
that
seemed
to
reduce
pete
to
a
pulp
his
eyes
pleaded
with
her
come
out
a
minit
while
i
tells
yeh
the
woman
nodded
slightly
at
maggie
and
the
mere
boy
me
the
mere
boy
interrupted
his
loving
smile
and
turned
a
shrivelling
glare
upon
pete
his
boyish
countenance
flushed
and
he
spoke
in
a
whine
to
the
woman
oh
i
say
nellie
this
ai
a
square
deal
you
know
you
goin
to
leave
me
and
go
off
with
that
duffer
are
you
i
should
think
why
you
dear
boy
of
course
i
not
cried
the
woman
affectionately
she
bended
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear
he
smiled
again
and
settled
in
his
chair
as
if
resolved
to
wait
patiently
as
the
woman
walked
down
between
the
rows
of
tables
pete
was
at
her
shoulder
talking
earnestly
apparently
in
explanation
the
woman
waved
her
hands
with
studied
airs
of
indifference
the
doors
swung
behind
them
leaving
maggie
and
the
mere
boy
seated
at
the
table
maggie
was
dazed
she
could
dimly
perceive
that
something
stupendous
had
happened
she
wondered
why
pete
saw
fit
to
remonstrate
with
the
woman
pleading
for
forgiveness
with
his
eyes
she
thought
she
noted
an
air
of
submission
about
her
leonine
pete
she
was
astounded
the
mere
boy
occupied
himself
with
and
a
cigar
he
was
tranquilly
silent
for
half
an
hour
then
he
bestirred
himself
and
spoke
well
he
said
sighing
i
knew
this
was
the
way
it
would
be
there
was
another
stillness
the
mere
boy
seemed
to
be
musing
she
was
pulling
that
the
whole
amount
of
it
he
said
suddenly
it
a
bloomin
shame
the
way
that
girl
does
why
spent
over
two
dollars
in
drinks
and
she
goes
off
with
that
who
looks
as
if
he
had
been
hit
in
the
face
with
a
i
call
it
rocky
treatment
for
a
fellah
like
me
here
waiter
bring
me
a
and
make
it
damned
strong
maggie
made
no
reply
she
was
watching
the
doors
it
a
mean
piece
of
business
complained
the
mere
boy
he
explained
to
her
how
amazing
it
was
that
anybody
should
treat
him
in
such
a
manner
but
i
get
square
with
her
you
bet
she
wo
get
far
ahead
of
yours
truly
you
know
he
added
winking
i
tell
her
plainly
that
it
was
mean
business
and
she
wo
come
it
over
me
with
any
of
her
she
thinks
my
name
is
freddie
you
know
but
of
course
it
ai
i
always
tell
these
people
some
name
like
that
because
if
they
got
onto
your
right
name
they
might
use
it
sometime
understand
oh
they
do
fool
me
much
maggie
was
paying
no
attention
being
intent
upon
the
doors
the
mere
boy
relapsed
into
a
period
of
gloom
during
which
he
exterminated
a
number
of
with
a
determined
air
as
if
replying
defiantly
to
fate
he
occasionally
broke
forth
into
sentences
composed
of
invectives
joined
together
in
a
long
string
the
girl
was
still
staring
at
the
doors
after
a
time
the
mere
boy
began
to
see
cobwebs
just
in
front
of
his
nose
he
spurred
himself
into
being
agreeable
and
insisted
upon
her
having
a
and
a
glass
of
beer
they
gone
he
remarked
they
gone
he
looked
at
her
through
the
smoke
wreaths

she
repeated
great
gawd
what

demanded
the
mere
boy
of
himself
stupefied
in
a
state
he
conducted
her
on
board
an
car
ostentatiously
paid
her
fare
leered
kindly
at
her
through
the
rear
window
and
fell
off
the
steps
chapter
xv
a
forlorn
woman
went
along
a
lighted
avenue
the
street
was
filled
with
people
desperately
bound
on
missions
an
endless
crowd
darted
at
the
elevated
station
stairs
and
the
horse
cars
were
thronged
with
owners
of
bundles
the
pace
of
the
forlorn
woman
was
slow
she
was
apparently
searching
for
some
one
she
loitered
near
the
doors
of
saloons
and
watched
men
emerge
from
them
she
scanned
furtively
the
faces
in
the
rushing
stream
of
pedestrians
hurrying
men
bent
on
catching
some
boat
or
train
jostled
her
elbows
failing
to
notice
her
their
thoughts
fixed
on
distant
dinners
the
forlorn
woman
had
a
peculiar
face
her
smile
was
no
smile
but
when
in
repose
her
features
had
a
shadowy
look
that
was
like
a
sardonic
grin
as
if
some
one
had
sketched
with
cruel
forefinger
indelible
lines
about
her
mouth
jimmie
came
strolling
up
the
avenue
the
woman
encountered
him
with
an
aggrieved
air
oh

began
jimmie
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
quickened
his
pace
ah

he
said
with
the
savageness
of
a
man
whose
life
is
pestered
the
woman
followed
him
along
the
sidewalk
in
somewhat
the
manner
of
a
suppliant
but
jimmie
she
said
yehs
told
me
ye
jimmie
turned
upon

fiercely

the
woman
stepped
closer
and
laid
her
fingers
on
his
arm
but
jimmie
snarled
oh
go
teh
hell
he
darted
into
the
front
door
of
a
convenient
saloon
and
a
moment
later
came
out
into
the
shadows
that
surrounded
the
side
door
on
the
brilliantly
lighted
avenue
he
perceived
the
forlorn
woman
dodging
about
like
a
scout
jimmie
laughed
with
an
air
of
relief
and
went
away
when
he
arrived
home
he
found
his
mother
clamoring
maggie
had
returned
she
stood
shivering
beneath
the
torrent
of
her
wrath

edged
about
as

unable
to
find
a
place
on
the
floor
to

into
the
room
and
ogled
her
as
if
they
formed
the
front
row
at
a
theatre
women
without
bended
toward
each
other
and
whispered
nodding
their
heads
with
airs
of
profound
philosophy
a
baby
overcome
with
curiosity
concerning
this
object
at
which
all
were
looking
sidled
forward
and
touched
her
dress
cautiously
as
if
investigating
a
stove
its
mother
voice
rang
out
like
a
warning
trumpet
she
rushed
forward
and
grabbed
her
child
casting
a
terrible
look
of
indignation
at
the
girl
maggie
mother
paced
to
and
fro
addressing
the
doorful
of
eyes
expounding
like
a
glib
showman
at

museum
her

rang
through

the
jeering
cries
ended
in
another
burst
of
shrill
laughter
the
girl
seemed
to
awaken
jimmie
he
drew
hastily
back
from
her
well
now

he
said
his
lips
curling
in
scorn
radiant
virtue
sat
upon
his
brow
and
his
repelling
hands
expressed
horror
of
contamination
maggie
turned
and
went
the
crowd
at
the
door
fell
back
precipitately
a
baby
falling
down
in
front
of
the
door
wrenched
a
scream
like
a
wounded
animal
from
its
mother
another
woman
sprang
forward
and
picked
it
up
with
a
chivalrous
air
as
if
rescuing
a
human
being
from
an
oncoming
express
train
as
the
girl
passed
down
through
the
hall
she
went
before
open
doors
framing
more
eyes
strangely
microscopic
and
sending
broad
beams
of
inquisitive
light
into
the
darkness
of
her
path
on
the
second
floor
she
met
the
gnarled
old
woman
who
possessed
the
music
box
so
she

pete
did
not
consider
that
he
had
ruined
maggie
if
he
had
thought
that
her
soul
could
never
smile
again
he
would
have
believed
the
mother
and

who
were
pyrotechnic
over
the
affair
to
be
responsible
for
it

he
felt
a
trifle
entangled
it
distressed
him
revelations
and
scenes
might
bring
upon
him
the
wrath
of
the
owner
of
the
saloon
who
insisted
upon
respectability
of
an
advanced
type
what
deh

do
dey
wan
na
raise
such
a
smoke
about
it
fer
demanded
he
of
himself
disgusted
with
the
attitude
of
the
family
he
saw
no
necessity
for
anyone
losing
their
equilibrium
merely
because
their
sister
or
their
daughter
had
stayed
away
from
home
searching
about
in
his
mind
for
possible
reasons
for
their
conduct
he
came
upon
the
conclusion
that
maggie
motives
were
correct
but
that
the
two
others
wished
to
snare
him
he
felt
pursued
the
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
whom
he
had
met
in
the
hilarious
hall
showed
a
disposition
to
ridicule
him
a
little
pale
thing
with
no
spirit
she
said
did
you
note
the
expression
of
her
eyes
there
was
something
in
them
about
pumpkin
pie
and
virtue
that
is
a
peculiar
way
the
left
corner
of
her
mouth
has
of
twitching
is
it
dear
dear
my
pete
what
are
you
coming
to
pete
asserted
at
once
that
he
never
was
very
much
interested
in
the
girl
the
woman
interrupted
him
laughing
oh
it
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
to
me
my
dear
young
man
you
need
draw
maps
for
my
benefit
why
should
i
be
concerned
about
it
but
pete
continued
with
his
explanations
if
he
was
laughed
at
for
his
tastes
in
women
he
felt
obliged
to
say
that
they
were
only
temporary
or
indifferent
ones
the
morning
after
maggie
had
departed
from
home
pete
stood
behind
the
bar
he
was
immaculate
in
white
jacket
and
apron
and
his
hair
was
plastered
over
his
brow
with
infinite
correctness
no
customers
were
in
the
place
pete
was
twisting
his
napkined
fist
slowly
in
a
beer
glass
softly
whistling
to
himself
and
occasionally
holding
the
object
of
his
attention
between
his
eyes
and
a
few
weak
beams
of
sunlight
that
had
found
their
way
over
the
thick
screens
and
into
the
shaded
room
with
lingering
thoughts
of
the
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
the
bartender
raised
his
head
and
stared
through
the
varying
cracks
between
the
swaying
bamboo
doors
suddenly
the
whistling
pucker
faded
from
his
lips
he
saw
maggie
walking
slowly
past
he
gave
a
great
start
fearing
for
the
eminent
respectability
of
the
place
he
threw
a
swift
nervous
glance
about
him
all
at
once
feeling
guilty
no
one
was
in
the
room
he
went
hastily
over
to
the
side
door
opening
it
and
looking
out
he
perceived
maggie
standing
as
if
undecided
on
the
corner
she
was
searching
the
place
with
her
eyes
as
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
pete
beckoned
to
her
hurriedly
intent
upon
returning
with
speed
to
a
position
behind
the
bar
and
to
the
atmosphere
of
respectability
upon
which
the
proprietor
insisted
maggie
came
to
him
the
anxious
look
disappearing
from
her
face
and
a
smile
wreathing
her
lips
oh
pete
she
began
brightly
the
bartender
made
a
violent
gesture
of
impatience
oh

gawd
cried
he
vehemently
what

demanded
with
an
air
of
injury
astonishment
swept
over
the
girl
features
why
pete
yehs
me

glanced
profound
irritation
his
countenance
reddened
with
the
anger
of
a
man

respectability
is
being
threatened

the

his
face
pete

oh

interrupted
pete
anticipating
the
girl
seemed
to
have
a
struggle
with
herself
she
was
apparently
bewildered
and
could
not
find
speech
finally
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
but
where
kin
i
go
the
question
exasperated
pete
beyond
the
powers
of
endurance
it
was
a
direct
attempt
to
give
him
some
responsibility
in
a
matter
that
did
not
concern
him
in
his
indignation
he
volunteered
information
oh
go
teh
hell
cried
he
he
slammed
the
door
furiously
and
returned
with
an
air
of
relief
to
his
respectability
maggie
went
away
she
wandered
aimlessly
for
several
blocks
she
stopped
once
and
asked
aloud
a
question
of
herself
who
a
man
who
was
passing
near
her
shoulder
humorously
took
the
questioning
word
as
intended
for
him
eh
what
who
nobody
i
did
say
anything
he
laughingly
said
and
continued
his
way
soon
the
girl
discovered
that
if
she
walked
with
such
apparent
aimlessness
some
men
looked
at
her
with
calculating
eyes
she
quickened
her
step
frightened
as
a
protection
she
adopted
a
demeanor
of
intentness
as
if
going
somewhere
after
a
time
she
left
rattling
avenues
and
passed
between
rows
of
houses
with
sternness
and
stolidity
stamped
upon
their
features
she
hung
her
head
for
she
felt
their
eyes
grimly
upon
her
suddenly
she
came
upon
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
silk
hat
and
a
chaste
black
coat
whose
decorous
row
of
buttons
reached
from
his
chin
to
his
knees
the
girl
had
heard
of
the
grace
of
god
and
she
decided
to
approach
this
man
his
beaming
chubby
face
was
a
picture
of
benevolence
and
his
eyes
shone
but
as
the
girl
timidly
accosted
him
he
gave
a
convulsive
movement
and
saved
his
respectability
by
a
vigorous
he
did
not
risk
it
to
save
a
soul
for
how
was
he
to
know
that
there
was
a
soul
before
him
that
needed
saving
chapter

upon
a
wet
evening
several
months
after
the
last

two
interminable
rows
of
cars
pulled
by
slipping
horses
jangled
along

with
drivers
clattered

glistening
with

behind
an
array
of
roses
and
chrysanthemums
two
or
three
theatres
emptied
a
crowd
upon
the
pavements
men
pulled
their
hats
over
their
eyebrows
and
raised
their
collars
to
their
ears
women
shrugged
impatient
shoulders
in
their
warm
cloaks
and
stopped
to
arrange
their
skirts
for
a
walk
through
the
storm
people
having
been
comparatively
silent
for
two
hours
burst
into
a
roar
of
conversation
their
hearts
still
kindling
from
the
glowings
of
the
stage
the
pavements
became
tossing
seas
of
umbrellas
men
stepped
forth
to
hail
cabs
or
cars
raising
their
fingers
in
varied
forms
of
polite
request
or
imperative
demand
an
endless
procession
wended
toward
elevated
stations
an
atmosphere
of
pleasure
and
prosperity
seemed
to
hang
over
the
throng
born
perhaps
of
good
clothes
and
of
having
just
emerged
from
a
place
of
forgetfulness
in
the
mingled
light
and
gloom
of
an
adjacent
park
a
handful
of
wet
wanderers
in
attitudes
of
chronic
dejection
was
scattered
among
the
benches
a
girl
of
the
painted
cohorts
of
the
city
went
along
the
street
she
threw
changing
glances
at
men
who
passed
her
giving
smiling
invitations
to
men
of
rural
or
untaught
pattern
and
usually
seeming
sedately
unconscious
of
the
men
with
a
metropolitan
seal
upon
their
faces
crossing
glittering
avenues
she
went
into
the
throng
emerging
from
the
places
of
forgetfulness
she
hurried
forward
through
the
crowd
as
if
intent
upon
reaching
a
distant
home
bending
forward
in
her
handsome
cloak
daintily
lifting
her
skirts
and
picking
for
her
feet
the
dryer
spots
upon
the
pavements
the
restless
doors
of
saloons
clashing
to
and
fro
disclosed
animated
rows
of
men
before
bars
and
hurrying
barkeepers
a
concert
hall
gave
to
the
street
faint
sounds
of
swift
music
as
if
a
group
of
phantom
musicians
were
hastening
a
tall
young
man
smoking
a
cigarette
with
a
sublime
air
strolled
near
the
girl
he
had
on
evening
dress
a
moustache
a
chrysanthemum
and
a
look
of
ennui
all
of
which
he
kept
carefully
under
his
eye
seeing
the
girl
walk
on
as
if
such
a
young
man
as
he
was
not
in
existence
he
looked
back
transfixed
with
interest
he
stared
glassily
for
a
moment
but
gave
a
slight
convulsive
start
when
he
discerned
that
she
was
neither
new
parisian
nor
theatrical
he
wheeled
about
hastily
and
turned
his
stare
into
the
air
like
a
sailor
with
a
a
stout
gentleman
with
pompous
and
philanthropic
whiskers
went
stolidly
by
the
broad
of
his
back
sneering
at
the
girl
a
belated
man
in
business
clothes
and
in
haste
to
catch
a
car
bounced
against
her
shoulder
hi
there
mary
i
beg
your
pardon
brace
up
old
girl
he
grasped
her
arm
to
steady
her
and
then
was
away
running
down
the
middle
of
the
street
the
girl
walked
on
out
of
the
realm
of
restaurants
and
saloons
she
passed
more
glittering
avenues
and
went
into
darker
blocks
than
those
where
the
crowd
travelled
a
young
man
in
light
overcoat
and
derby
hat
received
a
glance
shot
keenly
from
the
eyes
of
the
girl
he
stopped
and
looked
at
her
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
making
a
mocking
smile
curl
his
lips
come
now
old
lady
he
said
you
do
mean
to
tel
me
that
you
sized
me
up
for
a

a
labouring
man
marched
along
with
bundles
under
his
arms
to
her
remarks
he
replied
it
a
fine
evenin
ai

she
smiled
squarely
into
the
face
of
a
boy
who
was
hurrying
by
with
his
hands
buried
in
his
overcoat
pockets
his
blonde
locks
bobbing
on
his
youthful
temples
and
a
cheery
smile
of
unconcern
upon
his
lips
he
turned
his
head
and
smiled
back
at
her
waving
his
hands
not
this
eve
some
other
eve
a
drunken
man
reeling
in
her
pathway
began
to
roar
at
her
i

no

he
shouted
in
a
dismal
voice
he
lurched
on
up
the
street
wailing
to
himself
i

no

ba
luck

no

the
girl
went
into
gloomy
districts
near
the
river
where
the
tall
black
factories
shut
in
the
street
and
only
occasional
broad
beams
of
light
fell
across
the
pavements
from
saloons
in
front
of
one
of
these
places
whence
came
the
sound
of
a
violin
vigorously
scraped
the
patter
of
feet
on
boards
and
the
ring
of
loud
laughter
there
stood
a
man
with
blotched
features
further
on
in
the
darkness
she
met
a
ragged
being
with
shifting
bloodshot
eyes
and
grimy
hands
she
went
into
the
blackness
of
the
final
block
the
shutters
of
the
tall
buildings
were
closed
like
grim
lips
the
structures
seemed
to
have
eyes
that
looked
over
them
beyond
them
at
other
things
afar
off
the
lights
of
the
avenues
glittered
as
if
from
an
impossible
distance
bells
jingled
with
a
sound
of
merriment
at
the
feet
of
the
tall
buildings
appeared
the
deathly
black
hue
of
the
river
some
hidden
factory
sent
up
a
yellow
glare
that
lit
for
a
moment
the
waters
lapping
oilily
against
timbers
the
varied
sounds
of
life
made
joyous
by
distance
and
seeming
unapproachableness
came
faintly
and
died
away
to
a
silence

in

with

upon

about

by
a

of

adoration
he
drew
two

three

and
with
the
trembling
fingers
of

he

fallen
forward
on

chest
the
women
drank
and
laughed
not
heeding
the
slumbering
man
in
the
corner
finally
he
lurched
forward
and
fell
groaning
to
the
floor
the

in
disgust
and
drew

angrily

the

stayed
behind
taking
up
the
bills
and
stuffing
them
into
a
deep
pocket
a
guttural
snore
from
the
recumbent
man
caused
her
to
turn
and
look
down
at
him
she
laughed
what
a
damn
fool
she
said
and
went
the
smoke
from
the
lamps
settled
heavily
down
in
the
little
compartment
obscuring
the
way
out
the
smell
of
oil
stifling
in
its
intensity
pervaded
the
air
the
wine
from
an
overturned
glass
dripped
softly
down
upon
the
blotches
on
the

chapter
xix
in
a
room
a
woman
sat
at
a
table
eating
like
a
fat
monk
in
a
picture
a
soiled
unshaven
man
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
well
said

the
woman
her
mouth
filled
with
bread
mag

repeated
the

the
woman
she
continued
her
meal
when
she
finished
her
coffee
she
began
to
weep
i

remember
when
her
two

said
the
man
i
kin
remember
when
she
weared
worsted
boots
she
cried
the
neighbors
began
to
gather
in
the
hall
staring
in
at
the
weeping
woman
as
if
watching
the
contortions
of
a
dying
dog
a
dozen
women
entered
and
lamented
with
her
under
their
busy
hands
the
rooms
took
on
that
appalling
appearance
of
neatness
and
order
with
which
death
is
greeted
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
in
a
black
gown
rushed
in
with
outstretched
arms
ah
poor
mary
she
cried
and
tenderly
embraced
the
moaning
one
ah

continued
she

a
chil
her
good
motherly
face
was
wet
with
tears
she
trembled
in
eagerness
to
express
her
sympathy
the
mourner
sat
with
bowed
head
rocking
her
body
heavily
to
and
fro
and
crying
out
in
a
high
strained
voice
that
sounded
like
a
dirge
on
some
forlorn
pipe
i
kin
remember
when
she
weared
worsted
boots
an
her
two
feets
was
no
bigger

miss

she
cried
raising
her
streaming
eyes
ah

poor
mary
sobbed
the
woman
in
black
with
low
coddling
cries
she
sank
on
her
knees
by
the
mourner
chair
and
put
her
arms
about
her
the
other
women
began
to
groan
in
different
keys
yer

misguided

behavior
to

mudder
an
all
her
badness
she
gone
where
her
sins
will
be
judged
the
woman
in
black
raised
her
face
and
paused
the
inevitable
sunlight
came
streaming
in
at
the
windows
and
shed
a
ghastly
cheerfulness
upon
the
faded
hues
of
the
room
two
or
three
of
the
spectators
were
sniffling
and
one
was
loudly
weeping
the
mourner
arose
and
staggered
into
the
other
room
in
a
moment
she
emerged
with
a
pair
of
faded
baby
shoes
held
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
i
kin
remember
when
she
used
to
wear
dem
cried
she
the
women
burst
anew
into
cries
as
if
they
had
all
been
stabbed
the
mourner
turned
to
the
soiled
and
unshaven
man
jimmie

said
the
man
go

jimmie
shrieked
the
woman
confronting
him
fiercely
the
man
swore
sullenly
he
went
over
to
a
corner
and
slowly
began
to
put
on
his
coat
he
took
his
hat
and
went
out
with
a
dragging
reluctant
step
the
woman
in
black
came
forward
and
again
besought
the
mourner
yeh
fergive
her
mary

she

cried
the
other
women
like
a
choir
at
a
funeral
deh

deh
lord
takes
away
said
the
woman
in
black
raising
her
eyes
to
the
sunbeams
deh
lord
gives
and
deh
lord
takes
away
responded
the
others
yeh
fergive

mary
pleaded
the
woman
in
black
the
mourner
essayed
to
speak
but
her
voice
gave
way
she
shook
her
great
shoulders
frantically
in
an
agony
of
grief
hot
tears
seemed
to
scald
her
quivering
face
finally
her
voice
came
and
arose
like
a
scream
of
pain
oh
yes
i
fergive
her
i
fergive
her
