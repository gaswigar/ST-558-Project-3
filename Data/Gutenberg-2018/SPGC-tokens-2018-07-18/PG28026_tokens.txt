life
the

as
it
really
is
the
father
of
a
young
woman
who
was
preparing
to
become
a
virtuoso
once
applied
to
a
famous
musical
educator
for
advice
regarding
the
future
career
of
his
daughter
i
want
her
to
become
one
of
the
greatest
pianists
america
has
ever
produced
he
said
she
has
talent
good
health
unlimited
ambition
a
good
general
education
and
she
is
industrious
the
educator
thought
for
awhile
and
then
said
it
is
very
likely
that
your
daughter
will
be
successful
in
her
chosen
field
but
the
amount
of
grinding
study
she
will
be
obliged
to
undergo
to
meet
the
towering
standards
of
modern
pianism
is
awful
to
contemplate
in
the
end
she
will
have
the
flattery
of
the
multitude
and
let
us
hope
some
of
their
dollars
as
well
in
return
she
may
have
to
sacrifice
many
of
the
comforts
and
pleasures
which
women
covet
the
more
successful
she
is
the
more
of
a
nomad
she
must
become
she
will
know
but
few
days
for
years
when
she
will
not
be
compelled
to
practice
for
hours
she
becomes
a
kind
of
chattel
of
the
musical
public
she
will
be
harassed
by
ignorant
critics
and
perhaps
annoyed
by
unreliable
managers
in
return
she
has
money
and
fame
but
in
fact
far
less
of
the
great
joy
and
purpose
of
life
than
if
she
followed
the
customary
domestic
career
with
some
splendid
man
as
her
husband
when
i
was
younger
i
used
to
preach
quite
an
opposite
sermon
but
the
more
i
see
of
the
hardships
of
the
artist
life
the
less
i
think
of
the
dollars
and
the
fame
it
brings
it
is
hard
enough
for
a
man
but
it
is
twice
as
hard
for
a
woman
golden
bait
some
cynic
has
contended
that
the
almighty
dollar
has
been
the
greatest
incentive
to
the
struggling
virtuoso
in
european
music
centers
although
this
may
be
true
in
a
number
of
cases
it
is
certainly
unjust
in
others
many
of
the
virtuosos
find
travel
in
america
so
distasteful
that
notwithstanding
the
huge
golden
bait
the
managers
have
the
greatest
difficulty
in
inducing
the
pianists
to
come
back
indeed
there
are
many
artists
of
great
renown
whom
the
managers
would
be
glad
to
coax
to
our
country
but
who
have
withheld
tempting
offers
for
years
one
of
these
is
moritz
moszkowski
probably
the
most
popular
of
modern
pianoforte
composers
of
music
grieg
when
he
finally
consented
to
make
the
voyage
to
america
placed
his
price
at
two
thousand
five
hundred
dollars
for
every
concert
a
sum
which
any
manager
would
regard
prohibitive
except
in
the
case
of
one
pianist
grieg
intent
was
obvious
the
inconveniences
of
travel
in
america
have
been
ridiculously
exaggerated
in
europe
and
many
virtuosos
dread
the
thought
of
an
american
trip
with
the
great
ocean
yawning
between
the
two
continents
and
savages
just
beyond
new
york
or
certainly
not
far
from
chicago
de
pachmann
detests
the
ocean
and
when
he
comes
over
in
his
favorite
month
of
june
he
does
not
dare
return
until
the
following
june
others
who
have
never
visited
america
must
get
their
idea
of
american
travel
from
some
such
account
as
that
of
charles
dickens
in
his
unforgivable
in
which
he
said
in
describing
one
of
our
railroads
there
is
a
great
deal
of
jolting
a
great
deal
of
noise
a
great
deal
of
wall
not
much
window
a
locomotive
engine
a
shriek
and
a
bell
the
cars
are
like
shabby
omnibuses
holding
thirty
forty
fifty
people
in
the
centre
of
the
carriage
there
is
usually
a
stove
fed
with
charcoal
or
anthracite
coal
which
is
for
the
most
part
red
hot
it
is
insufferably
close
and
you
see
the
hot
air
fluttering
between
yourself
and
any
other
object
you
may
happen
to
look
at
there
could
have
been
but
little
improvement
in
our
railroads
in
when
rubinstein
came
to
america
for
although
he
accepted
for
concerts
during
his
first
trip
he
refused
an
offer
of
for
only
concerts
when
a
manager
tried
to
persuade
him
to
return
american
railroads
now
present
the
acme
of
comfort
convenience
and
even
luxury
in
travel
yet
the
european
artist
has
difficulty
in
adjusting
himself
to
journeys
of
thousands
of
miles
crowded
in
a
short
winter
season
when
he
has
been
accustomed
to
little
trips
of
a
few
hundred
kilometers
he
comes
to
dread
the
trains
as
we
might
a
prison
van
paderewski
resorts
to
a
private
car
but
even
this
luxurious
mode
of
travel
may
be
very
monotonous
and
exhausting
the
great
distances
must
certainly
account
for
some
of
the
evidences
of
strain
which
deform
the
faces
and
exhaust
the
minds
of
so
many
virtuosos
the
traveling
salesman
seems
to
thrive
upon
miles
of
railroad
travel
as
do
the
crews
of
the
trains
but
the
virtuoso
dragged
from
concert
to
concert
by
his
showman
grows
tired
oh
so
tired
pale
wan
listless
and
indifferent
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
he
is
quite
another
person
the
magnetism
that
has
done
so
much
to
win
him
fame
shines
in
his
eyes
and
seems
to
emanate
from
his
but
the
difference
in
his
physical
being
at
the
end
of
the
season
is
sickening
like
a
bedraggled
circus
coming
in
from
the
wear
and
tear
of
a
hard
season
he
crawls
wearily
back
to
new
york
with
a
cinematographic
recollection
of
countless
telegraph
poles
flying
past
the
windows
audience
after
audience
sleeping
cars
budding
geniuses
the
inevitable
receptions
with
their
equally
inevitable
chicken
salad
or
lukewarm
oysters
and
the
sweet
young
things
who
like
heine
mythical
tribe
of
must
love
or
perish
some
virtuosos
have
the
physical
strength
to
endure
all
this
even
enjoy
it
but
many
have
confessed
to
me
that
their
american
tours
have
been
literal
nightmares
one
of
the
greatest
pianists
was
obliged
to
stay
in
new
york
for
a
while
before
attempting
the
voyage
homeward
at
the
time
he
was
so
weak
from
the
rigors
of
the
tour
that
he
could
scarcely
write
his
name
his
haggard
face
suggested
the
tortures
of
a
torquamada
rather
than
buffalo
kansas
city
denver
and
pittsburgh
his
voice
was
tired
and
faltering
and
his
chief
interest
was
that
of
the
invalid
getting
home
as
soon
as
possible
to
have
talked
with
him
upon
music
at
that
time
would
have
been
an
injustice
accordingly
i
led
him
away
from
the
subject
and
dwelt
upon
the
woes
of
his
native
poland
and
much
to
his
surprise
left
him
without
the
educational
material
of
which
i
had
been
in
quest
he
asked
the
reason
and
i
told
him
that
a
musical
conference
at
that
time
could
serve
no
purpose
as
men
and
women
aside
from
the
attainments
which
have
made
them
illustrious
virtuosos
are
for
the
most
part
very
much
like
ordinary
mortals
who
have
to
content
themselves
at
the
foot
of
parnassus
it
has
been
my
privilege
to
know
thirty
or
more
of
the
most
eminent
artists
and
some
have
become
good
personal
friends
it
is
interesting
to
observe
how
several
very
different
types
of
individuals
may
succeed
in
winning
public
favor
as
virtuosos
indeed
except
for
the
caricature
which
the
public
accepts
as
the
conventional
virtuoso
there
is
no
virtuoso
type
here
is
a
business
man
here
an
artist
here
an
engineer
here
a
jurist
here
an
actor
here
a
poet
and
here
a
freak
all
of
them
distinguished
performers
perhaps
the
enthusiastic
will
resent
the
idea
of
a
freak
becoming
famous
as
a
pianist
but
i
have
known
no
less
than
three
men
who
could
not
possibly
be
otherwise
described
but
who
have
nevertheless
made
both
fame
and
fortune
as
virtuosos
freak
pianists
the
anthropologist
who
chooses
to
conduct
special
investigations
of
freaks
can
find
no
more
entertaining
field
than
that
of
the
remarkable
freaks
of
the
brain
shown
in
the
cases
of
some
astonishing
performers
whose
intelligence
and
mental
capacity
in
other
ways
has
been
negligible
the
classic
case
of
blind
tom
for
instance
was
that
of
a
freak
not
so
very
far
removed
in
kind
from
the
siamese
twins
or
general
tom
thumb
born
a
slave
in
georgia
and
wholly
without
what
teachers
would
term
a
musical
education
blind
tom
amazed
many
of
the
most
conservative
musicians
of
his
time
it
was
possible
for
him
to
repeat
difficult
compositions
after
hearing
them
played
only
once
i
conversed
with
him
a
number
of
years
ago
in
new
york
only
to
find
that
intellectually
and
physically
he
was
allied
to
the
blind
tom
peculiar
ability
has
led
many
hasty
commentators
to
conclude
that
music
is
a
wholly
separate
mental
faculty
to
be
found
particularly
in
a
more
or
less
shiftless
and
irresponsible
class
of
gifted
but
intellectually
limited
human
beings
the
few
cases
of
men
and
women
whose
musical
talent
seems
to
eclipse
their
minds
so
that
they
remain
in
utter
darkness
to
everything
else
in
life
should
not
be
taken
as
a
basis
for
judging
other
artists
of
real
genius
and
undisputed
mental
breadth
i
have
in
mind
however
the
case
of
one
pianist
who
is
very
widely
known
and
highly
lauded
but
who
is
very
slightly
removed
from
the
class
of
blind
tom
a
trained
alienist
one
acquainted
with
the
difference
between
the
eccentricities
which
frequently
accompany
greatness
and
the
unconscious
physical
and
psychical
evidences
of
idiocy
which
so
clearly
agree
with
the
antics
of
the
chimpanzee
or
the
droll
capuchin
monkeys
might
find
in
the
performer
to
whom
i
refer
a
subject
for
some
very
interesting
not
to
say
startling
reflections
few
have
ever
been
successful
in
inducing
this
pianist
to
talk
upon
any
other
subject
than
music
for
more
than
a
few
minutes
at
a
time
another
pianist
who
was
distinguished
as
a
liszt
pupil
and
who
toured
america
repeatedly
seemed
to
have
a
hatred
for
the
piano
that
amounted
to
an
obsession
look
he
exclaimed
i
am
its
slave
it
has
sent
me
round
and
round
the
world
night
after
night
year
after
year
it
has
cursed
me
like
a
wandering
jew
no
rest
no
home
no
liberty
do
you
wonder
that
i
drink
to
forget
it
a
pathetic
example
and
drink
he
did
in
bacchanalian
measure
one
time
he
gave
an
unconscious
exhibition
of
his
technical
ability
that
while
regrettable
would
have
been
of
immense
interest
to
psychologists
who
are
seeking
to
prove
that
music
depends
upon
a
separate
operation
of
a
special
faculty
during
his
american
tours
i
called
frequently
upon
this
virtuoso
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
his
method
of
playing
he
was
rarely
free
from
the
influence
of
alcohol
for
more
than
a
few
hours
at
a
time
one
morning
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
see
him
professionally
and
when
i
found
him
at
his
hotel
he
was
in
a
truly
disgraceful
condition
i
remember
that
he
was
unable
to
stand
from
the
fact
that
he
fell
upon
me
while
i
was
sitting
in
a
morris
chair
he
was
barely
able
to
talk
and
just
prior
to
my
leaving
he
insisted
upon
scrawling
upon
his
visiting
card
zur
freundlichen
errinerung
auf
einen
sehr
späten
abend
friendly
remembrances
of
a
very
late
evening
since
it
was
still
very
early
in
the
morning
it
may
be
realized
that
he
had
lost
all
idea
of
his
whereabouts
nevertheless
he
sat
at
the
piano
keyboard
and
played
tremendously
difficult
compositions
by
liszt
and
brahms
compositions
which
compelled
his
hands
to
leap
from
one
part
of
the
keyboard
to
the
other
as
in
the
case
of
the
liszt
he
never
missed
a
note
until
he
lost
his
balance
upon
the
piano
stool
and
fell
to
the
floor
disgusting
and
pathetic
as
the
exhibition
was
i
could
not
help
feeling
that
i
was
witnessing
a
marvelous
instance
of
automatism
that
wonderful
power
of
the
mind
working
through
the
body
to
reproduce
apparently
without
effort
or
thought
operations
which
have
been
repeated
so
many
times
that
they
have
become
second
nature
more
than
this
it
indicated
clearly
that
while
the
better
part
of
the
body
was
dead
to
the
world
the
faculty
he
had
cultivated
to
the
highest
extent
still
remained
alive
some
years
later
this
man
succumbed
to
alcoholism
the
pianist
of
contrasted
with
a
type
of
this
kind
may
be
mentioned
such
men
as
sauer
rachmaninov
paderewski
godowsky
bachaus
rosenthal
pauer
joseffy
stojowski
scharwenka
gabrilowitsch
hofmann
bauer
lhévinne
to
say
nothing
of
the
ladies
carreño
goodson
many
of
whom
are
intellectual
giants
most
all
are
exceedingly
regular
in
their
habits
and
at
least
two
are
strong
temperance
advocates
intellectually
pianists
of
this
class
represent
a
very
remarkable
kind
of
mentality
one
is
impressed
with
the
surprising
quickness
with
which
their
brains
operate
even
in
ordinary
conversation
speaking
in
alien
languages
they
find
comparatively
little
difficulty
in
expressing
themselves
with
rapidity
and
fluency
very
few
great
singers
ever
acquire
a
similar
ease
these
pianists
are
wonderfully
well
read
many
being
acquainted
with
the
literature
of
three
or
more
tongues
in
the
original
indeed
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
them
skipping
through
several
languages
during
ordinary
conversation
without
realizing
that
they
are
performing
linguistic
feats
that
would
put
the
average
college
graduate
to
shame
they
are
familiar
with
art
science
politics
manufactures
even
in
their
most
recent
developments
what
is
your
favorite
type
of
aëroplane
asked
one
some
years
ago
in
the
kindergarten
days
of
cloud
navigation
i
told
him
that
i
had
made
no
choice
since
i
had
never
seen
a
flying
machine
despite
the
fact
that
i
was
a
native
of
the
country
that
gave
it
birth
he
then
vouchsafed
his
opinions
and
entered
into
a
physical
and
mechanical
discussion
of
the
matter
indicating
that
he
had
spent
hours
in
getting
the
whole
subject
straightened
out
in
his
mind
this
same
man
a
german
knew
whole
cantos
of
the
by
heart
and
could
repeat
long
scenes
from
with
a
very
creditable
english
accent
the
average
american
tired
business
man
who
is
inclined
to
look
upon
the
touring
virtuoso
as
only
a
pianist
would
be
immensely
surprised
if
he
were
called
upon
to
compare
his
store
of
universal
information
with
that
of
the
performer
he
would
soon
see
that
his
long
close
confinement
behind
the
bars
of
the
dollar
sign
had
made
him
the
intellectual
inferior
of
the
musician
he
almost
ignores
but
it
is
hardly
fair
to
compare
these
famous
interpreters
with
the
average
tired
business
man
they
are
the
cecil
rhodes
the
thomas
edisons
the
maurice
maeterlincks
of
their
fields
it
is
easy
enough
to
find
musicians
of
smaller
life
opportunities
basking
in
their
ignorance
and
conceit
while
the
virtuoso
may
be
described
as
intellectual
in
the
broader
sense
of
the
term
he
usually
has
a
great
fear
of
becoming
academic
he
aspires
to
be
artistic
rather
than
scholarly
he
strives
to
elevate
rather
than
to
teach
in
the
strictly
pedagogical
sense
some
of
the
greatest
performers
have
been
notoriously
weak
as

they

the

of

neither
do
they
long
for
the
cheap
that
so
many
of
the
french
feuilletonists
delight
in
describing
why
should
the
immorality
of
the
artist
life
be
laid
at
the
doors
of

the
artist
life
is
wrapped
up
in
making
his
readings
of
master
works
more
significant
more
eloquent
more
beautiful
he
is
interested
in
everything
that
contributes
to
his
artistry
whether
it
be
literature
science
history
art
or
the
technic
of
his
own
interpretative
development
he
penetrates
the
various
mystic
problems
which
surround
piano
playing
by
the
infallible
process
of
persistent
study
and
reflection
the
psychical
phase
of

him
immensely
particularly
the
phenomena
of
personal

often
called
magnetism
the
magic
of
magnetism
magnetism
is
surely
one
of
the
most
enviable
possessions
of
the
successful
pianist
just
what
magnetism
is
and
how
it
comes
to
be
few
psychologists
attempt
to
relate
we
all
have
our
theories
just
why
one
pianist
who
often
blunders
as
readily
as
a
rubinstein
or
who
displays
his
many
shortcomings
at
every
concert
can
invariably
draw
larger
audiences
and
arouse
more
applause
than
his
confrère
with
weaker
vital
forces
although
he
be
admittedly
a
better
technician
a
more
highly
educated
gentleman
and
perhaps
a
more
sensitive
musician
charles
frohman
keenest
of
theatrical
producers
attributed
the
success
to
vitality
and
in
doing
this
he
merely
chose
one
of
the
weaker
synonyms
of
magnetism
vitality
in
this
sense
does
not
imply
great
bodily
strength
it
is
rather
professor
john
quackenbos
formerly
of
columbia
university
essays
the
following
definition
of
magnetism
in
his
excellent
magnetism
is
nothing
more
than
earnestness
and
sincerity
coupled
with
insight
sympathy
patience
and
tact
these
essentials
can
not
be
bought
and
can
not
be
taught
they
are
by
nature
they
are
dyed
with
red
ripe
of
the
heart
but
quackenbos
is
a
physician
and
a
philosopher
had
he
been
a
lexicographer
he
would
have
found
the
term
magnetism
far
more
inclusive
he
would
at
least
have
admitted
the
phenomenon
which
we
have
witnessed
so
often
when
one
possessed
with
volcanic
vitality
overwhelms
a
great
audience
the
old
idea
that
magnetism
is
a
kind
of
invisible
form
of
intellectual
or
psychic
electricity
has
gone
down
the
grotesque
phrenological
vagaries
of
gall
as
well
as
some
of
the
pseudoscientific
theories
of
that
very
unusual
man
mesmer
we
all
possess
what
is
known
as
magnetism
some
have
it
in
an
unusual
degree
as
did
edwin
booth
franz
liszt
phillips
brooks
and
bismarck
it
was
surely
neither
the
art
nor
the
ability
of
daniel
webster
that
made
his
audiences
accept
some
of
his
fatuous
platitudes
as
great
utterances
nor
was
it
the
histrionic
talent
alone
of
richard
mansfield
that
enabled
him
to
wring
success
from
such
an
obvious
theatrical
contraption
as
both
webster
with
his
fathomless
eyes
and
his
ponderous
voice
and
mansfield
with
his
compelling
personality
were
exceptional
examples
of
magnetism
a
notable
example
among
virtuosos
paderewski
is
peculiarly
forceful
in
the
personal
spell
he
casts
over
his
audience
someone
has
said
that
it
cost
one
hundred
thousand
dollars
to
exploit
his
hair
before
he
made
his
first
american
tour
but
it
was
by
no
means
curiosity
to
see
his
hair
which
kept
on
filling
auditorium
after
auditorium
i
attended
his
first
concert
in
new
york
and
was
amazed
to
see
a
comparatively
small
gathering
of
musical
zealots
his
command
of
the
audience
was
at
once
imperial
the
critics
some
of
whom
would
have
found
paderewski
hirsute
crown
a
delightful
rack
upon
which
to
hang
their
ridicule
went
into
ecstasies
instead
his
art
and
his
striking
personality
entirely
apart
from
his
appearance
soon
made
him
the
greatest
concert
attraction
in
the
musical
world
anyone
who
has
conversed
with
him
for
more
than
a
few
moments
realizes
what
the
meaning
of
the
word
magnetism
is
his
entire
bearing
his
lofty
attitude
of
mind
his
personal
dignity
all
contribute
to
the
inexplicable
attraction
that
the
arch
hypnotist
mesmer
first
described
as
animal
magnetism
that
magnetism
of
the
pianist
must
be
considered
wholly
apart
from
personal
beauty
and
great
physical
strength
is
obvious
to
anyone
who
has
given
the
subject
a
moment
thought
many
of
the
artists
already
mentioned
in
this
book
who
possess
magnetism
similar
to
that
of
paderewski
could
surely
never
make
claim
for
personal
beauty
neither
is
magnetism
akin
to
that
attraction
we
all
experience
when
we
see
a
powerful
horse
a
sleek
hound
a
handsome
tiger
that
is
it
is
not
mere
admiration
for
a
beautiful
animal
whether
it
has
any
similarity
to
the
mysterious
charm
which
makes
the
doomed
bird
lose
control
of
its
wings
upon
the
approach
of
a
snake
is
difficult
to
estimate
certainly
in
the
paraphernalia
of
the
modern
recital
with
its
lowered
lights
and
its
solitary
figure
playing
away
at
a
polished
instrument
one
may
find
something
of
the
physical
apparatus
employed
by
the
professional
hypnotist
to
insure
concentration
but
even
this
can
not
account
for
the
pianist
real
attractiveness
if
vitality
means
the
vital
spark
the
life
element
it
comes
very
close
to
a
true
definition
of
magnetism
for
success
without
this
precious
promethean
force
is
inconceivable
it
may
be
only
a
smouldering
ember
in
the
soul
of
a
dying
chopin
but
if
it
is
there
it
is
irresistible
until
it
becomes
extinct
facial
beauty
and
physical
prowess
all
made
way
for
the
kind
of
magnetism
that
socrates
george
sand
julius
cæsar
henry
viii
paganini
emerson
dean
swift
or
richard
wagner
possessed
more
wonderful
still
is
the
fact
that
magnetism
is
by
no
means
confined
to
those
who
have
finely
trained
intellects
or
who
have
achieved
great
reputations
some
vaudeville
buffoon
or
some
gypsy
fiddler
may
have
more
attractive
power
than
the
virtuoso
who
had
spent
years
in
developing
his
mind
and
his
technic
the
average
virtuoso
thinks
far
more
of
his
geist
his
talent
or
as
emerson
would
have
it
the
shadow
of
the
soul
the
otherwise
than
he
does
of
his
technic
or
his
cadenzas
by
what
mystic
means
magnetism
may
be
developed
the
writer
does
not
pretend
to
know
possibly
by
placing
one
deeper
self
shall
we
say
subconscious
self
in
closer
communion
with
the
great
throbbing
problems
of
the
invisible
though
perpetually
evident
forces
of
nature
which
surround
us
we
may
become
more
alive
more
sensitively
vivified
what
would
it
mean
to
the
young
virtuoso
if
he
could
go
to
some
occult
master
some
seer
of
a
higher
thought
and
acquire
that
which
has
drawn
fame
and
fortune
to
the
blessed
few
hundreds
have
spent
fortunes
upon
charlatans
in
the
attempt
all
artists
know
the
part
that
the
audience
itself
plays
in
falling
under
the
magnetic
spell
of
the
performer
its
connection
with
the
phenomena
of
autosuggestion
is
very
clear
wundt
the
famous
german
psychologist
showed
a
class
of
students
how
superstitions
unconsciously
acquired
in
early
life
affect
sensible
adults
who
have
long
since
passed
the
stage
at
which
they
might
put
any
credence
in
omens
at
a
concert
given
by
a
famous
player
the
audience
has
been
well
schooled
in
anticipation
the
artist
always
appears
under
a
halo
his
reputation
has
made
for
him
this
very
reputation
makes
his
conquest
far
easier
than
that
of
the
novice
who
has
to
prove
his
ability
before
he
can
win
the
sympathy
of
the
audience
he
is
far
more
likely
to
find
the
audience
than
indifferent
sometime
at
the
play
in
a
theater
watch
how
the
audience
will
unconsciously
mirror
the
facial
expressions
of
the
forceful
actor
in
some
similar
manner
the
virtuoso
on
the
concert
platform
sensitizes
the
minds
and
emotions
of
the
sympathetic
audience
if
the
effect
is
deep
and
lasting
the
artist
is
said
to
possess
that
kohinoor
of
virtuosodom
magnetism
some
widely
read
critics
have
made
the
very
natural
error
of
confounding
magnetism
with
personality
these
words
have
quite
different
connotations
personality
comprehending
the
more
subtle
force
of
magnetism
an
artist
individual
worth
is
very
closely
allied
with
his
personality
that
is
his
whole
extrinsic
attitude
toward
the
thought
and
action
of
the
world
about
him
how
important
personality
is
may
be
judged
by
the
widely
advertised
efforts
of
the
manufacturers
of
machines
to
convince
the
public
that
their
products
often
astonishingly
fine
do
actually
reproduce
the
individual
effects
which
come
from
the
playing
of
the
living
artist
machines
have
their
place
and
it
is
an
important
one
however
wonderful
as
they
may
be
they
can
never
be
anything
but
machines
they
bring
unquestioned
joy
to
thousands
and
they
act
as
missionaries
for
both
music
and
the
by
taking
the
art
into
countless
homes
where
it
might
otherwise
never
have
penetrated
thus
creating
the
foundation
for
a
strong
desire
for
a
thorough
study
of
music
the
machine
may
easily
boast
of
a
mechanism
as
wonderful
as
that
of
a
liszt
a
or
a
bachaus
but
it
can
no
more
claim
personality
than
the
typewriter
upon
which
this
article
is
being
written
can
claim
to
reproduce
the
individuality
which
characterizes
the
handwriting
of
myriads
of
different
persons
personality
then
is
the
virtuoso
one
great
unassailable
stronghold
it
is
personality
that
makes
us
want
to
hear
a
half
dozen
different
renderings
of
a
single
beethoven
sonata
by
a
half
dozen
different
pianists
each
has
the
charm
and
flavor
of
the
interpreter
but
personality
in
its
relation
to
art
has
been
so
exquisitely
defined
by
the
inimitable
british
essayist
benson
that
we
can
do
no
better
than
to
quote
his
words
i
have
lately
come
to
perceive
that
the
one
thing
which
gives
value
to
any
piece
of
art
whether
it
be
book
or
picture
or
music
is
that
subtle
and
evasive
thing
which
is
called
personality
no
amount
of
labor
of
zest
even
of
accomplishment
can
make
up
for
the
absence
of
this
quality
it
must
be
an
almost
instinctive
thing
i
believe
of
course
the
mere
presence
of
personality
in
a
work
of
art
is
not
sufficient
because
the
personality
revealed
may
be
lacking
in
charm
and
charm
again
is
an
instinctive
thing
no
artist
can
set
out
to
capture
charm
he
will
toil
all
the
night
and
take
nothing
but
what
every
artist
can
and
must
aim
at
is
to
have
a
perfectly
sincere
point
of
view
he
must
take
his
chance
as
to
whether
his
point
of
view
is
an
attractive
one
but
sincerity
is
the
one
indispensable
thing
it
is
useless
to
take
opinions
on
trust
to
retail
them
to
adopt
them
they
must
be
formed
created
felt
the
work
of
a
sincere
artist
is
almost
certain
to
have
some
value
the
work
of
an
insincere
artist
is
of
its
very
nature
worthless
benson
charm
is
what
the
virtuoso
feels
as
magnetism
it
puts
something
into
the
artist
playing
that
he
can
not
define
for
a
moment
the
vital
spark
flares
into
a
bewildering
flame
and
all
his
world
is
peopled
with
moths
hovering
around
the
divine
fire
the
greatest
thing
of
all
if
we
have
dwelt
too
long
upon
magnetism
those
who
know
its
importance
in
the
artist
life
will
readily
perceive
the
reason
but
do
not
let
us
be
led
away
into
thinking
that
magnetism
can
take
the
place
of
hard
work
even
the
tiny
prodigy
has
a
career
of
work
behind
him
and
the
master
pianist
has
often
climbed
to
his
position
over
and
of
industry
days
of
practice
months
of
study
years
of
struggle
are
part
of
the
biography
of
almost
every
one
who
has
attained
real
greatness
what
a
pity
to
destroy
illusions
some
prefer
to
think
of
their
artist
heroes
dreaming
their
lives
away
in
the
hectic
cafés
of
pesth
or
buried
in
the
melancholy
absinthe
and
paresis
of
some
morbid
cabaret
of
paris
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
best
known
pianists
live
a
totally
different
life
a
life
of
grind
grind
grind
incessant
study
endless
practice
and
ceaseless
search
for
means
to
raise
their
artistic
standing
in
some
quiet
country
villa
miles
away
from
the
center
of
unlicensed
bacchanalian
revels
the
virtuoso
may
be
found
working
hard
upon
next

the
greatest

life
is
ii
are
pianists
born
or
made
some
years
ago
the
director
of
the
leipsic
conservatorium
gave
the
writer
a
complete
record
of
the
number
of
graduates
of
the
conservatory
from
the
founding
to
the
late
nineties
of
the
thousands
of
students
who
had
passed
through
the
institution
only
a
few
had
gained
wide
prominence
hardly
one
student
in
one
hundred
had
won
his
way
into
the
most
voluminous
of
the
musical
biographical
dictionaries
the
proportion
of
distinguished
graduates
to
those
who
fail
to
gain
renown
is
very
high
at
leipsic
compared
with
many
other
institutions
what
becomes
of
the
thousands
of
students
all
working
frantically
with
the
hope
of
becoming
famous
pianists
surely
so
much
earnest
effort
can
not
be
wasted
even
though
all
can
not
win
the
race
those
who
often
convince
themselves
that
they
have
failed
go
on
to
perform
a
more
useful
service
to
society
than
the
virtuoso
unheralded
and
unapplauded
they
become
the
teachers
the
true
missionaries
of
to
the
people
what
is
it
then
which
promotes
a
few
fortunate
ones
from
the
armies
of
students
all
over
america
and
europe
and
makes
of
them
great
virtuosos
what
must
one
do
to
become
a
virtuoso
how
long
must
one
study
before
one
may
make
a
what
does
a
great
virtuoso
receive
for
his
performances
how
long
does
the
virtuoso
practice
each
day
what
exercises
does
he
use
all
these
and
many
more
similar
questions
crop
up
regularly
in
the
offices
of
music
critics
and
in
the
studios
of
teachers
unfortunately
a
definite
answer
can
be
given
to
none
although
a
great
deal
may
be
learned
by
reviewing
some
of
the
experiences
of
one
who
became
great
some
virtuosos
actually
seem
to
be
born
with
the
heavenly
gift
many
indeed
are
sons
and
daughters
of
parents
who
see
their
own
demolished
dreams
realized
in
the
triumphs
of
their
children
when
little
nathan
creeps
to
the
piano
and
quite
without
the
help
of
his
elders
picks
out
the
song
he
has
heard
his
mother
sing
all
the
neighbors
in
odessa
know
it
the
next
day
a
wonder
child
perhaps
oh
happy
augury
of
fame
and
fortune
little
nathan
shall
have
the
best
of
instruction
his
mother
will
teach
him
at
first
of
course
she
will
shape
his
little
fingers
to
the
keyboard
she
will
sing
sweet
folk
melodies
in
his
ear
songs
of
labor
struggle
exile
she
will
count
laboriously
day
after
day
until
he
plays
in
time
all
the
while
the
little
mother
sees
far
beyond
the
ghetto
out
into
the
great
world
grand
auditoriums
breathless
crowds
countless
lights
nobles
granting
trinkets
bravos
from
a
thousand
throats
nathan
surrounded
by
endless
wreaths
of
laurel
oh
it
is
all
too
much
nathan
nathan
you
are
playing
far
too
fast
one
two
three
four
one
two
three
four
there
that
is
the
tempo
clementi
would
have
had
it
fine
some
day
nathan
you
will
be
a
great
pianist
and
etc
nathan
next
goes
to
the
great
teacher
he
is
already
eight
years
old
and
fairly
leaping
out
of
his
mother
arms
two
years
with
the
teacher
and
nathan
is
probably
ready
for
a
as
a
wonder
child
the
critics
are
kind
if
his
parents
are
very
poor
nathan
may
go
from
town
to
town
for
awhile
being
exhibited
like
a
trained
poodle
or
a
tiny
acrobat
the
further
he
gets
from
home
the
more
severe
his
critics
become
and
nathan
and
his
mother
hurry
back
to
the
old
teachers
who
tell
them
that
nathan
must
still
practice
long
and
hard
as
well
as
do
something
to
build
up
his
general
education
the
world
in
these
days
looks
askance
at
the
musician
who
aside
from
his
keyboard
accomplishments
is
a
numskull
more
sacrifice
for
nathan
mother
and
father
but
what
are
poverty
and
deprivation
with
such
a
goal
in
sight
nathan
studies
for
some
years
in
the
schools
and
in
the
high
schools
as
well
as
at
the
conservatory
in
the
music
school
he
will
doubtless
spend
six
years
in
all
two
years
in
the
or
master
classes
following
the
regular
course
when
sufficiently
capable
he
will
take
a
few
pupils
at
a
kopeck
or
so
per
lesson
to
help
out
with
the
family
expenses
nathan
graduates
from
the
conservatory
with
high
honors
will
the
public
now
receive
him
as
a
great
pianist
a
concert
is
planned
and
nathan
plays
day
and
night
for
years
his
whole
family
have
been
looking
forward
to
that
concert
let
us
concede
that
the
concert
is
a
triumph
does
he
find
fame
and
fortune
waiting
for
him
next
morning
no
indeed
there
are
a
thousand
nathans
all
equally
accomplished
again
he
must
work
and
again
he
must
concertize
perhaps
after
years
of
strife
a
manager
may
approach
him
some
day
with
a
contract
lucky
nathan
have
you
not
a
thousand
brothers
who
may
never
see
a
contract
then
can
it
be
possible
nathan
is
it
really
america
america
the
golconda
nathan
makes
a
glorious
perhaps
the
little
mother
goes
with
him
more
likely
she
stays
at
home
in
odessa
waiting
with
glistening
eyes
for
each
incoming
mail
pupils
come
to
nathan
and
he
charges
for
each
lesson
a
sum
equaling
his
father
former
weekly
wage
away
with
the
ghetto
away
with
poverty
away
with
oblivion
nathan
is
a
real
virtuoso
a
veritable
the
american
virtuoso
of
how
does
the
american
aspirant
compete
with
nathan
are
there
not
as
fine
teachers
here
in
america
as
in
europe
is
it
really
necessary
to
go
to
europe
to
finish
one
musical
education
can
one
not
become
a
virtuoso
in
america
more
questions
with
which
editors
and
teachers
are
constantly
plied
can
one
who
for
years
has
waged
a
battle
for
the
american
teacher
and
american
musical
education
answer
this
question
without
bias
can
we
who
trace
the
roots
of
our
lineage
back
to
barren
plymouth
or
stolid
new
netherland
judge
the
question
fairly
and
honestly
one
case
suffices
to
show
the
road
which
the
american
virtuoso
is
likely
to
travel
she
is
still
a
young
woman
in
her
twenties
among
her
teachers
was
one
who
ranks
among
the
very
best
in
america
her
general
education
was
excellent
in
fact
far
superior
to
that
of
the
average
young
lady
of
good
family
in
continental
europe
while
in
her
early
teens
she
became
the
leading
feature
at
conservatory
concerts
her
teacher
won
many
a
profitable
pupil
through
her
brilliant
playing
she
studies
as
do
so
many
american
pupils
without
making
a
regular
business
of
it
compared
with
the
six
year
all
day
week
in
and
week
out
course
which
nathan
pursued
in
odessa
our
little
compatriot
was
at
a
decided
disadvantage
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
music
student
making
a
regular
business
of
learning
the
profession
as
would
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
have
not
students
contented
themselves
with
two
lessons
a
week
since
time
immemorial
need
we
go
further
to
discover
one
of
the
flaws
in
our
own
educational
system
a
flaw
that
is
not
due
to
the
teacher
or
to
the
methods
of
instruction
but
rather
to
our
custom
two
lessons
a
week
are
adequate
for
the
student
who
does
not
aspire
to
become
a
professional
but
altogether
insufficient
for
the
student
who
must
accomplish
a
vast
amount
of
work
in
a
comparatively
small
number
of
years
she
requires
constant
advice
regular
daily
instruction
and
careful
attention
under
experienced
instructors
teachers
are
not
to
be
blamed
if
she
does
not
receive
this
kind
of
attention
as
there
are
abundant
opportunities
now
in
america
to
receive
systematic
training
under
teachers
as
thorough
as
able
and
as
inspiring
as
may
be
found
in
europe
the
excuse
that
the
expense
is
greater
in
america
falls
when
we
learn
the
very
high
prices
charged
by
leading
teachers
in
germany
austria
and
france
to
go
back
to
our
particular
case
the
young
lady
is
informed
at
the
end
of
a
course
of
two
or
three
lessons
a
week
during
two
or
three
years
that
she
is
a
virtuoso
and
may
now
enter
the
concert
field
to
compete
with
carreño
or
goodson
her
playing
is
obviously
superior
to
that
of
her
contemporary
students
someone
insists
upon
a
short
course
of
study
abroad
not
because
it
is
necessary
but
because
it
might
add
to
her
reputation
and
make
her
first
flights
in
the
american
concert
field
more
spectacular
accordingly
she
goes
to
europe
only
to
find
that
she
is
literally
surrounded
by
budding
virtuosos
an
army
of
nathans
any
one
of
whom
might
easily
eclipse
her
against
her
personal
charm
her
vigor
her
yankee
smartness
nathan
places
his
years
of
systematic
training
his
soul
saturated
in
the
music
and
art
of
past
centuries
of
european
endeavor
and
perhaps
his
youth
of
poverty
which
makes
success
imperative
the
young
lady
european
teacher
frankly
tells
her
that
while
her
playing
is
delightful
for
the
salon
or
parlor
she
will
never
do
for
the
great
concert
hall
she
must
learn
to
play
with
more
power
more
virility
more
character
accordingly
he
sets
her
at
work
along
special
lines
of
technic
in
order
to
make
up
for
the
lack
of
the
training
which
the
young
lady
might
easily
have
had
at
home
had
her
parents
been
schooled
to
systematic
daily
study
as
a
necessity
her
first
technical
exercises
with
the
new
teacher
are
so
simple
that
the
young
woman
is
on
the
verge
of
despair
until
she
realizes
that
her
playing
is
really
taking
on
a
new
and
more
mature
character
she
has
been
lifting
fifty
pound
weights
occasionally
her
teacher
is
training
her
to
lift
one
hundred
pound
weights
every
day
she
has
been
sketching
in
pastels
her
teacher
is
now
teaching
her
how
to
make
strokes
in
oils
her
gain
is
not
a
mere
matter
of
loudness
she
could
play
quite
as
loud
before
she
went
to
europe
there
is
something
mature
in
this
new
style
of
playing
something
that
resembles
the
playing
of
the
other
virtuosos
she
has
heard
who
is
the
great
european
master
who
is
working
such
great
wonders
for
her
none
other
than
a
celebrated
teacher
who
taught
for
years
in
america
a
master
no
better
than
dozens
of
others
in
america
right
now
can
the
teachers
in
america
be
blamed
if
the
parents
and
the
pupils
fail
to
make
as
serious
and
continued
an
effort
here
atmosphere
bosh
work
long
hard
and
unrelenting
that
is
the
salvation
of
the
student
who
would
become
a
virtuoso
with
our
increasing
wealth
and
advancing
culture
american
parents
are
beginning
to
discover
that
given
the
same
work
and
the
same
amount
of
instruction
musical
education
in
america
differs
very
slightly
from
musical
education
abroad
but
we
are
deserting
our
young
virtuoso
most
ungallantly
in
berlin
she
hears
so
many
concerts
and
recitals
so
many
different
styles
of
playing
that
she
begins
to
think
for
herself
and
her
sense
of
artistic
discrimination
interpretation
if
you
will
becomes
more
and
more
acute
provided
with
funds
for
attending
concerts
she
does
regularly
whereas
in
america
she
neglected
opportunities
equally
good
she
never
realized
before
that
there
could
be
so
much
to
a
brahms
or
a
chopin
at
the
end
of
her
first
year
her
american
tells
her
that
a
plunge
into
the
concert
field
is
still
dangerous
accordingly
she
remains
two
or
possibly
three
more
years
and
at
the
end
if
she
has
worked
hard
she
is
convinced
that
with
proper
management
she
may
stand
some
chance
of
winning
that
fickle
treasure
public
favor
but
persists
the
reader
it
would
have
been
possible
for
her
to
have
accomplished
the
same
work
at
home
in
america
most
certainly
if
she
had
had
any
one
of
the
hundred
or
more
virtuoso
teachers
now
resident
in
the
united
states
all
of
whom
are
capable
of
bringing
a
highly
talented
pupil
to
virtuoso
heights
and
if
in
their
teaching
they
had
exerted
sufficient
to
demand
from
the
pupil
and
the
pupil
parents
the
same
conditions
which
would
govern
the
work
of
the
same
pupil
studying
in
europe
through
long
tradition
and
by
means
of
endless
experiences
the
conditions
have
been
established
in
europe
the
student
who
aspires
to
become
a
professional
is
given
a
distinctively
professional
course
in
america
the
need
for
such
a
training
is
but
scantily
appreciated
only
a
very
few
of
us
are
able
to
appraise
the
real
importance
of
music
in
the
advancement
of
human
civilization
nor
is
this
unusual
since
most
of
us
have
but
to
go
back
but
a
very
few
generations
to
encounter
our
blessed
puritan
and
quaker
ancestors
to
whom
all
music
barring
the
lugubrious
psalm
singing
was
the
inspiration
of
the
devil
the
teachers
as
has
been
said
before
are
fully
ready
and
more
than
anxious
to
give
the
kind
of
training
required
very
frequently
parents
are
themselves
to
blame
for
the
slender
style
of
playing
which
their
children
present
they
measure
the
needs
of
the
concert
hall
by
the
dimensions
of
the
parlor
the
teacher
of
the
professional
pupil
aspires
to
produce
a
quantity
of
tone
that
will
fill
an
auditorium
seating
at
least
one
thousand
people
the
pupil
at
home
is
enjoined
not
to
bang
or
pound
the
result
is
a
feeble
characterless
tone
which
rarely
fills
an
auditorium
as
it
should
the
actor
can
not
forever
rehearse
in
whispers
if
he
is
to
fill
a
huge
theater
and
the
concert
pianist
must
have
a
strong
sure
resilient
touch
in
order
to
bring
about
climaxes
and
make
the
range
of
his
dynamic
power
indeed
the
separation
from
home
ties
or
shall
we
call
them
home
interferences
is
often
more
responsible
for
the
results
achieved
abroad
than
superior
instruction
unfortunately
the
number
of
virtuosos
who
have
been
taught
exclusively
in
america
is
really
very
small
it
is
not
a
question
of
ability
upon
the
part
of
the
teacher
or
talent
upon
the
part
of
the
pupil
it
is
entirely
a
matter
of
the
attitudes
of
the
teacher
the
pupil
and
the
pupil
home
advisers
success
demands
discipline
and
the
most
lofty
standards
imaginable
teachers
who
have
taught
for
years
in
america
have
returned
to
europe
doubled
and
quadrupled
their
fees
and
under
surroundings
and
with
more
rigid
standards
of
artistic
work
have
produced
results
they
declare
would
have
been
impossible
in
america
the
author
contends
that
these
results
would
have
been
readily
forthcoming
if
we
in
america
assumed
the
same
earnest
persistent
attitude
toward
the
work
itself
if
these
words
do
no
more
than
reach
the
eyes
of
some
of
those
who
are
advising
students
wrongly
in
this
matter
they
will
not
have
been
written
in
vain
the
european
concert
triumphs
of
a
beach
whose
training
was
received
wholly
in
the
united
states
is
an
indication
of
what
may
be
achieved
in
america
if
the
right
course
is
pursued
conditions
are
changing
rapidly
in
our
country
particularly
in
the
wonderful
west
and
it
seems
likely
that
many
pianists
without
foreign
instruction
of
any
kind
will
have
as
great
success
in
our
concert
field
as
have
many
of
our
best
opera
singers
who
have
never
had
a
lesson
on
the
other
side
our
little
pianist
has
again
been
playing
truant
from
our
manuscript
let
us
see
what
happens
to
her
when
she
finished
her
work
with
the
famous
teacher
abroad
surely
the
making
of
a
virtuoso
is
an
expensive
matter
let
us
take
the
estimate
of
the
young
pianist
father
who
practically
mortgaged
his
financial
existence
to
give
his
daughter
the
right
musical
training
lessons
with
first
teacher
at
a
lesson
eighty
lessons
a
year
for
four
years
lessons
with
second
american
teacher
for
two
years
at
a
lesson
lessons
with
third
american
teacher
at
a
lesson
for
one
year
and
six
months
music
books
etc
piano
maintenance
for
eight
years
at
a
year
minimum
estimate
four
years
in
europe
travel
board
instruction
advertising
etc
total
but
the
expense
has
only
begun
if
you
please
the
harvest
is
still
a
long
way
off
according
to
the
fine
traditions
established
by
the
late
barnum
there
must
be
a
european
furore
to
precede
the
american
advent
of
the
musical
star
the
journalistic
astronomers
must
point
their
telescopes
long
and
steadily
at
the
european
firmament
and
proclaim
their
discovery
in
the
columns
of
their
papers
again
furores
are
expensive
one
must
hire
an
auditorium
hire
an
orchestra
and
according
to
some
very
frank
and
disgusted
young
virtuosos
who
have
failed
to
succeed
hire
a
critic
or
so
like
the
amusing
trotter
in
first
what
with
three
and
four
concerts
a
night
why
should
not
the
critics
have
a
for
extra
critical
attention
fortunately
the
best
papers
hold
their
criticisms
above
price
bought
criticisms
are
very
rare
and
if
the
young
pianist
or
any
representative
approaches
certain
critics
with
any
such
suggestion
she
may
count
upon
faring
very
badly
in
cold
type
on
the
following
day
if
miss
virtuoso
makes
a
success
her
press
notices
are
sent
to
her
american
concert
managers
who
purchase
space
in
some
american
musical
newspapers
and
reprint
these
notices
publicity
of
this
kind
is
legitimate
as
the
american
public
knows
that
in
most
cases
these
press
notices
are
reprinted
solely
as
advertising
it
is
simply
the
commercial
process
of
acquainting
the
trade
and
if
done
right
may
prove
one
of
the
most
fortunate
investments
for
the
young
artist
do
not
imagine
however
that
the
pianist
american
manager
speculates
in
the
problematical
success
of
the
coming
virtuoso
on
the
contrary
his
fee
for
putting
the
artist
on
his
list
and
promoting
her
interests
may
range
from
five
hundred
dollars
to
two
thousand
dollars
in
advance
after
that
the
manager
usually
requires
a
commission
on
all
engagements
booked
graft
spoils
plunder
not
a
bit
of
it
if
the
manager
is
a
good
one
that
is
if
he
is
an
upright
business
man
well
schooled
in
his
work
the
investment
should
prove
a
good
one
exploiting
a
new
artist
is
a
matter
demanding
brains
energy
ingenuity
and
experience
a
manufacturing
firm
attempting
to
put
some
new
product
upon
an
already
crowded
market
would
spend
not
a
year
in
advertising
but
the
manager
must
maintain
an
organization
he
must
travel
he
must
advertise
and
he
too
must
live
if
he
succeeds
in
marketing
the
services
of
the
young
virtuoso
at
one
or
two
hundred
dollars
a
concert
the
returns
soon
begin
to
overtake
the
incessant
expenses
however
only
the
most
persistent
and
talented
artists
survive
to
reap
these
rewards
the
late
henry
wolfsohn
one
of
the
greatest
managers
america
has
ever
produced
told
the
writer
frequently
that
the
task
of
introducing
a
new
artist
was
one
of
the
most
thankless
and
uncertain
undertakings
imaginable
does
the
work
the
time
the
expense
frighten
you
little
miss
at
the
keyboard
do
you
fear
the
grind
the
grueling
disappoints
the
unceasing
sacrifices
then
abandon
your
great
career
and
join
the
army
of
useful
music
workers
who
are
teaching
the
young
people
of
the
land
to
love
music
as
it
should
be
loved
not
in
hysterical
outbursts
in
the
concert
hall
but
in
the
home
circle
if
you
have
the
unextinguishable
fire
within
your
soul
if
you
have
the
talent
from
on
high
if
you
have
health
energy
system
vitality
nothing
can
stop
you
from
becoming
great
advice
interferences
obstacles
will
be
nothing
to
you
you
will
work
day
and
night
to
reach
your
goal
what
better
guide
could
you
possibly
have
than
the
words
of
the
great
pianists
themselves
while
the
ensuing
pages
were
compiled
with
the
view
of
helping
the
amateur
performer
quite
as
much
as
the
student
who
would
become
a
professional
pianist
you
will
nevertheless
find
in
the
expressions
of
the
really
great
virtuosos
a
wealth
of
information
and
practical
advice
most
of
the
following
chapters
are
the
results
of
many
different
conferences
with
the
greatest
living
pianists
all
have
had
the
revision
of
the
artists
in
person
before
publication
was
undertaken
in
order
to
indicate
how
carefully
and
willingly
this
was
done
by
the
pianists
it
is
interesting
to
note
the
case
of
the
great
russian
rachmaninoff
the
original
conference
was
conducted
in
german
and
in
french
the
material
was
arranged

rachmaninoff
then
requested
a
second
conference
in
the
mean
time
he
had
had
the
better
part
of
the
manuscript
translated
into
his
native
russian
however
in
order
to
insure
accuracy
in
the
use
of
words
the
writer
translated
the
entire
matter
back
into

presence
rachmaninoff
did
not
speak

and
the
writer
did
not
speak

the
chapter
relating
to
harold
bauer
is
the
result
of
a
conference
conducted
in
english
bauer
use
of
his
native
tongue
is
as
fluent
and
eloquent
as
a
poet
or
an
orator
in
order
that
his
ideas
might
have
the
best
possible
expression
the
entire
chapter
was
written
several
times
in
manuscript
and
carefully
rearranged
and
rephrased
by
bauer
in
person
some
of
the
conferences
lasted
well
on
through
the
night
the
twenty
years
experience
in
teaching
was
constantly
needed
to
grasp
different
shadings
of
meaning
that
some
pianists
found
difficult
to
phrase
many
indeed
have
felt
their
weakness
in
the
art
of
verbal
expression
and
have
rejoiced
to
have
their
ideas
clothed
with
fitting
words
complete
frankness
and
sincerity
were
encouraged
in
every
case
the
results
of
the
conference
with
wilhelm
bachaus
conceded
by
many
other
pianists
to
be
the
foremost
technicalist
of
the
day
are
it
will
be
observed
altogether
different
in
the
statement
of
teaching
principles
from
those
of
harold
bauer
each
is
a
sincere
expression
of
individual
opinion
and
the
thoughtful
student
by
weighing
the
ideas
of
both
may
reach
conclusions
immensely
to
his
personal
advantage
no
wider
range
of
views
upon
the
subject
of
pianoforte
playing
could
possibly
come
between
the
covers
of
a
book
the
student
the
teacher
and
the
music
lover
who
acquaints
himself
with
the
opinions
of
the
different
masters
of
the
keyboard
can
not
fail
to
have
a
very
clear
insight
into
the
best
contemporary
ideas
upon
technic
interpretation
style
and
expression
the
author
or
shall
he
call
himself
a
collector
believes
that
the
use
of
the
questions
following
each
chapter
will
be
found
practical
and
useful
in
the
work
of
both
clubs
and
classes
practice
however
is
still
more
important
than
precept
the
student
might
easily
learn
this
book
by
heart
and
yet
be
unable
to
play
a
perfect
scale
let
him
remember
the
words
of
locke
men
of
much
reading
are
greatly
learned
but
may
be
little
knowing
after
all
the
virtuoso
is
great
because
he
really
knows
and
pepito
arriola
biographical
pepito
arriola
was
born
on
the
of
december
a
careful
investigation
of
his
ancestry
reveals
that
no
less
than
twelve
of
his
forefathers
and
relations
have
been
pronouncedly
musical
his
father
was
a
physician
but
his
mother
was
a
musician
his
early
musical
training
was
given
to
him
exclusively
by
his
mother
the
following
was
prepared
when
he
was
twelve
years
old
and
at
that
time
he
was
apparently
a
perfectly
healthy
child
with
the
normal
activity
of
a
boy
of
his
age
and
with
a
little
more
general
education
in
addition
to
his
music
than
the
average
child
at
fifteen
or
sixteen
possesses
he
spoke
french
german
fluently
and
spanish
but
little
english
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
received
numerous
honors
from
european
monarchs
and
famous
musicians
he
was
exceptionally
modest
in
his
playing
he
seemed
never
to
miss
a
note
in
even
very
complicated
compositions
and
his
musical
maturity
and
point
of
view
were
truly
astonishing
the
following
is
particularly
valuable
from
an
educational
standpoint
because
of
the
absolute
unaffectedness
of
the
child
narrative
of
his
own
training
the
following
conference
was
conducted
in
german
and
french

iii
the
story
of
a
wonder
child
pepito
arriola
my
earliest
recollections
so
much
that
was
of
interest
to
me
was
continually
occurring
while
i
was
a
child
that
it
all
seems
like
a
kind
of
haze
to
me
i
can
not
remember
when
i
first
commenced
to
play
for
my
mother
tells
me
that
i
wanted
to
reach
out
for
the
keyboard
before
i
was
out
of
her
arms
i
have
also
learned
that
when
i
was
about
two
and
years
of
age
i
could
quite
readily
play
after
my
mother
anything
that
the
size
of
my
hand
would
permit
me
to
play
i
loved
music
so
dearly
and
it
was
such
fun
to
run
over
the
keyboard
and
make
the
pretty
sounds
that
the
piano
was
really
my
first
and
best
toy
i
loved
to
hear
my
mother
play
and
continually
begged
her
to
play
for
me
so
that
i
could
play
the
same
pieces
after
her
i
knew
nothing
of
musical
notation
and
played
entirely
by
ear
which
seemed
to
me
the
most
natural
way
to
play
at
that
time
word
was
sent
to
the
king
of
spain
that
i
showed
talent
and
he
became
interested
in
me
and
i
played
before
him
my
friendship
with
arthur
nikisch
a
short
time
afterward
herr
arthur
nikisch
conductor
of
the
orchestra
at
leipsic
and
at
one
time
conductor
of
the
boston
symphony
orchestra
in
america
came
to
madrid
to
conduct
the
philharmonic
orchestra
for
a
special
concert
some
one
told
him
about
my
playing
and
i
was
permitted
to
play
for
him
he
became
so
interested
that
he
insisted
upon
my
being
taken
to
leipsic
for
further
study
i
was
then
four
years
of
age
and
although
musical
advantages
in
spain
are
continually
increasing
my
mother
thought
it
best
at
the
time
that
she
should
follow
the
great
musician
advice
and
that
i
should
be
taken
to
the
german
city
i
want
to
say
that
in
my
earliest
work
my
mother
made
no
effort
to
push
me
or
urge
me
to
go
ahead
i
loved
to
play
for
the
sake
of
playing
and
needed
no
coaxing
to
spend
time
at
the
keyboard
in
my
very
early
years
i
was
permitted
to
play
in
public
very
little
although
there
were
constant
demands
made
to
engage
me
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
kind
of
curiosity
and
my
mother
wanted
me
to
study
in
the
regular
way
with
good
masters
and
also
to
acquire
more
strength
before
i
played
in
public
very
much
i
did
however
play
at
the
great
albert
hall
in
london
the
big
building
holds
people
but
that
was
so
long
ago
that
i
have
almost
forgotten
all
about
it
except
that
they
all
seemed
pleased
to
see
a
little
boy
of
four
playing
in
so
very
big
a
place
i
also
played
for
royal
personages
including
the
kaiser
of
germany
who
was
very
good
to
me
and
gave
me
a
beautiful
pin
i
like
the
kaiser
very
much
he
seems
like
a
fine
man
my
first
regular
instruction
my
first
teacher
aside
from
my
mother
was
a
herr
dreckendorf
of
leipsic
he
was
very
kind
to
me
and
took
the
greatest
pains
but
the
idea
of
learning
the
notes
was
very
distasteful
to
me
i
was
terribly
bored
with
the
technical
exercises
he
gave
me
but
have
since
learned
that
one
can
save
much
time
by
practicing
scales
and
exercises
although
i
do
not
like
them
i
practice
them
every
day
now
for
a
little
while
so
as
to
get
my
fingers
in
good
working
order
in
about
six
weeks
i
knew
all
that
was
expected
of
me
in
the
way
of
scales
in
octaves
sixths
thirds
double
thirds
and
my
teacher
commenced
to
turn
his
attention
to
studies
and
pieces
for
the
first
time
i
found
musical
notation
interesting
for
then
i
realized
that
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
wait
until
some
one
else
played
a
piece
before
i
could
begin
to
explore
its
beauties
ah
it
was
wonderful
those
first
days
with
the
pieces
i
was
in
a
new
country
and
could
hardly
wait
to
master
one
at
a
time
so
eager
was
i
to
reach
the
next
one
and
see
just
what
it
was
like
herr
dreckendorf
gave
me
some
studies
by
dussek
cramer
the
of
bach
but
before
long
the
fascination
of
playing
beautiful
pieces
was
so
great
that
he
found
it
hard
to
keep
me
away
from
them
early
repertory
so
hungry
was
i
to
find
new
musical
works
that
when
i
was
eight
and
a
half
years
old
i
could
play
from
memory
such
pieces
as
the
b
flat
minor
scherzo
the
a
flat
major
polonaise
and
most
of
the
valses
and
études
of
chopin
i
also
played
the
sixth
rhapsody
of
liszt
and
the
c
minor
concerto
of
beethoven
in
the
mean
time
we
moved
to
berlin
and
this
has
been
our
home
ever
since
so
you
see
i
have
seen
far
more
of
germany
than
of
my
native
country
spain
in
fact
it
seems
more
natural
for
me
to
speak
german
than
spanish
at
the
age
of
seven
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
come
under
the
instruction
of
alberto
jonas
the
spanish
virtuoso
who
for
many
years
was
at
the
head
of
a
large
music
school
in
america
i
can
never
be
grateful
enough
to
him
for
he
has
taught
me
without
remuneration
and
not
even
a
father
could
be
kinder
to
me
when
i
left
berlin
for
my
present
tour
tears
came
to
our
eyes
because
i
knew
i
was
leaving
my
best
friend
most
of
my
present
repertory
has
been
acquired
under
jonas
and
he
has
been
so
so
exacting
he
also
saw
to
it
that
my
training
was
broad
and
not
confined
to
those
composers
whose
works
appealed
most
to
me
the
result
is
that
i
now
appreciate
the
works
of
all
the
composers
for
the
piano
beethoven
i
found
very
absorbing
i
learned
the
in
one
time
and
longed
for
more
my
teacher
however
insisted
upon
my
going
slowly
and
mastering
all
the
little
details
i
have
also
developed
a
great
fondness
for
bach
because
i
like
to
find
how
he
winds
his
melodies
in
and
out
and
makes
such
beautiful
things
of
them
i
play
a
great
deal
of
bach
including
the
g
minor
organ
fugue
which
liszt
played
the
devil
with
in
arranging
it
for
the
piano
goodness
knows
it
was
difficult
enough
for
the
organ
in
its
original
form
i
do
see
why
liszt
wanted
to
make
it
more
difficult
liszt
is
of
course
considered
a
great
master
for
the
piano
and
i
play
his
works
with
great
delight
especially
the
with
its
beautiful
bell
effect
but
i
can
not
look
upon
liszt
as
a
pianistic
composer
in
the
same
way
that
one
thinks
of
chopin
as
a
pianistic
composer
the
piano
was
chopin
natural
tongue
liszt
tongue
like
that
of
beethoven
was
the
orchestra
he
knew
no
difficulties
according
to
the
manner
in
which
he
wrote
his
own
works
consequently
one
must
think
of
the
orchestra
in
playing
liszt
works
while
the
works
of
chopin
suggest
only
the
piano
my
daily
practice
during
most
of
my
life
my
practice
has
never
exceeded
two
hours
a
day
in
this
country
while
on
tour
i
never
practice
more
than
one
and
hours
this
is
not
necessary
because
of
the
concerts
themselves
which
keep
up
my
technical
work
i
never
worry
about
my
fingers
if
i
can
think
the
pieces
right
my
fingers
will
always
play
the
notes
my
mother
insists
upon
my
being
out
in
the
open
air
all
the
time
i
am
not
studying
and
practicing
and
i
am
out
the
better
part
of
the
day
at
my
practice
periods
i
devote
at
least
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
to
technical
exercises
and
strive
to
play
all
the
scales
in
the
different
forms
in
all
the
keys
once
each
day
i
then
play
some
of
my
concert
numbers
continually
trying
to
note
if
there
is
any
place
that
requires
attention
if
there
is
i
at
once
spend
a
little
time
trying
to
improve
the
passage
it
is
very
largely
a
matter
of
thinking
the
musical
thought
right
and
then
saying
it
in
the
right
way
if
you
think
it
right
and
your
aim
at
the
keyboard
is
good
you
are
not
likely
to
hit
the
wrong
notes
even
in
skips
such
as
one
finds
in
the
rubinstein
valse
in
e
flat
i
do
not
ever
remember
of
hitting
the
upper
note
wrong
it
all
seems
so
easy
to
me
that
i
am
sure
that
if
other
children
in
america
would
look
upon
other
examples
in
the
same
way
they
could
not
find
their
work
so
very
difficult
i
love
to
practice
chopin
one
can
not
be
so
intimate
with
bach
he
is
a
little
cold
and
unfriendly
until
one
knows
him
very
well
general
education
i
have
said
that
we
play
as
we
think
the
mind
must
be
continually
improved
or
the
fingers
will
grow
dull
in
order
to
see
the
beauties
in
music
we
must
see
the
beauties
in
other
studies
i
have
a
private
teacher
who
comes
to
me
in
berlin
and
teaches
me
different
studies
i
have
studied
some
latin
french
and
the
regular
school
studies
electricity
interests
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
and
i
like
to
learn
about
it
but
my
greatest
interest
is
in
the
study
of
astronomy
surely
nothing
could
be
finer
than
to
look
at
the
stars
i
have
friends
among
the
astronomers
of
berlin
who
let
me
look
through
their
telescopes
and
tell
me
all
about
the
different
constellations
and
the
worlds
that
look
like
moons
when
you
see
them
enlarged
it
is
all
so
wonderful
that
it
makes
one
never
cease
thinking
i
also
like
to
go
to
factories
and
learn
how
different
things
are
made
i
think
that
there
are
so
many
things
that
one
can
learn
outside
of
a
for
instance
i
went
to
a
wire
factory
recently
and
i
am
sure
that
i
found
out
a
great
many
things
i
might
never
have
found
out
in
books
one
also
learns
by
traveling
and
when
i
am
on
my
tours
i
feel
that
i
learn
more
of
the
different
people
and
the
way
they
live
than
i
ever
could
from
geographies
do
you
think
i
am
a
lucky
boy
one
must
study
geography
however
to
learn
about
maps
and
the
way
in
which
countries
are
formed
i
have
toured
in
germany
russia
and
england
and
now
in
america
america
interests
me
wonderfully
everything
seems
so
much
alive
and
i
like
the
climate
very
much
theoretical
studies
musical
theory
bores
me
now
almost
as
much
as
my
first
technical
studies
did
richard
strauss
the
great
german
composer
has
very
kindly
offered
to
teach
me
i
like
him
very
much
and
he
is
so
kind
but
his
thundering
musical
effects
sometimes
seems
very
noisy
to
me
i
know
many
of
the
rules
of
harmony
but
they
are
very
uncomfortable
and
disagreeable
to
me
i
would
far
rather
write
my
music
as
it
comes
to
me
herr
nikisch
says
that
when
i
do
it
that
way
i
make
very
few
blunders
but
i
know
i
can
never
be
a
composer
until
i
have
mastered
all
the
branches
of
musical
theory
i
am
now
writing
a
symphony
i
played
some
parts
for
herr
nikisch
and
he
has
agreed
to
produce
it
of
course
the
orchestral
parts
will
have
to
be
written
for
me
but
i
know
what
instruments
i
want
to
express
certain
ideas
putting
down
the
notes
upon
paper
is
so
tiresome
why
ca
one
think
the
musical
thoughts
and
have
them
preserved
without
the
tedious
work
of
writing
them
out
sometimes
before
i
can
get
them
on
paper
they
are
gone
no
one
knows
where
and
the
worst
of
all
is
that
they
never
come
back
it
is
far
greater
fun
to
play
the
piano
or
play
football
or
go
rowing
reading
and
study
i
love
to
read
and
my
favorite
of
all
books
is
three
i
have
also
read
something
of
shakespeare
goethe
schiller
and
many
other
writers
i
like
parts
of
the
great
spanish
novel
but
i
find
it
hard
to
read
as
a
whole
i
think
that
music
students
ought
to
read
a
great
deal
it
makes
them
think
and
it
gives
them
poetical
thoughts
music
is
after
all
only
another
kind
of
poetry
and
if
we
get
poetical
ideas
from
books
we
become

i

wilhelm
bachaus
biographical
wilhelm
bachaus
was
born
at
leipsic
march
two
years
before
the
death
of
franz
liszt
nine
years
younger
than
josef
hofmann
and
a
trifle
more
than
the
age
of
paderewski
he
represents
a
different
decade
from
that
of
other
pianists
included
in
this
work
bachaus
studied
for
nine
years
with
alois
reckendorf
a
moravian
teacher
who
was
connected
with
the
leipsic
conservatory
for
more
than
thirty
years
reckendorf
had
been
a
student
of
science
and
philosophy
at
the
vienna
and
the
heidelberg
universities
and
was
an
earnest
musician
and
teacher
with
theories
of
his
own
he
took
an
especial
interest
in
bachaus
and
was
his
only
teacher
with
the
exception
of
one
year
spent
with
and
three
lessons
with
siloti
although
bachaus
commenced
playing
when
he
was
eight
years
old
he
feels
that
his
professional
was
made
in
london
in
june
when
he
played
the
tremendously
difficult
variations
in
when
bachaus
was
only
he
won
the
famous
rubinstein
prize
at
paris
this
consists
of
francs
offered
every
five
years
to
young
men
between
the
ages
of
twenty
and
the
following
conference
was
conducted
in
english
and
german
iv
the
pianist
of
wilhelm
bachaus
yesterday
and
it
is
somewhat
surprising
how
very
little
difference
exists
between
the
material
used
in
piano
teaching
and
that
employed
forty
or
fifty
years
ago
of
course
there
has
been
a
remarkable
amount
of
new
technical
material
exercises
studies
devised
written
and
published
and
some
of
this
presents
the
advantage
of
being
an
improvement
upon
the
old
an
improvement
which
may
be
termed
an
advance
but
taken
all
in
all
the
advance
has
been
very
slight
when
compared
with
the
astonishing
advances
made
in
other
sciences
and
other
phases
of
human
progress
in
this
time
it
would
seem
that
the
science
of
music
for
the
processes
of
studying
the
art
are
undoubtedly
scientific
left
little
territory
for
new
explorers
and
inventors
despite
the
great
number
of
études
that
have
been
written
imagine
for
one
moment
what
a
desert
the
technic
of
music
would
be
without
czerny
clementi
tausig
pischna
to
say
nothing
of
the
great
works
of
scarlatti
and
bach
which
have
an
effect
upon
the
technic
but
are
really
great
works
of
musical
art
the
wonderful
efficacy
of
scales
personally
i
practice
scales
in
preference
to
all
other
forms
of
technical
exercises
when
i
am
preparing
for
a
concert
add
to
this
arpeggios
and
bach
and
you
have
the
basis
upon
which
my
technical
work
stands
pianists
who
have
been
curious
about
my
technical
accomplishments
have
apparently
been
amazed
when
i
have
told
them
that
scales
are
my
great
technical
mainstay
that
is
scales
plus
hard
work
they
evidently
have
thought
that
i
had
some
kind
of
alchemic
secret
like
the
philosopher
stone
which
was
designed
to
turn
the
baser
metals
into
gold
i
possess
no
secrets
which
any
earnest
student
may
not
acquire
if
he
will
work
in
the
laboratory
of
music
long
enough
there
are
certain
artistic
points
which
only
come
with
experiment
as
the
chemist
finds
the
desired
result
by
interminable
eliminations
so
the
artist
must
weigh
and
test
his
means
until
he
finds
the
one
most
likely
to
produce
the
most
beautiful
or
the
most
appropriate
result
but
this
seeking
for
the
right
effect
has
little
to
do
with
the
kind
of
technic
which
necessitates
one
to
keep
every
muscle
employed
in
properly
exercised
and
i
may
reiterate
with
all
possible
emphasis
that
the
source
of
my
technical
equipment
is
scales
scales
scales
i
find
their
continued
daily
practice
not
only
beneficial
but
necessary
i
still
find
it
desirable
to
practice
scales
for
half
an
hour
a
day
bach
musically
omnipotent
it
seems
almost
foolish
to
repeat
what
has
been
said
so
many
times
about
the
wonderful
old
cantor
of
leipsic
johann
sebastian
bach
however
there
may
still
be
some
who
have
not
yet
become
acquainted
with
the
indisputable
fact
that
the
practice
of
bach
is
the
shortest
quickest
road
to
technical
finish
busoni
has
enlarged
upon
bach
impossible
as
that
may
seem
but
as
a
modern
bridge
is
sometimes
built
upon
wonderful
old
foundations
busoni
has
taken
the
idea
of
bach
and
with
his
penetrative
and
interpretative
ability
has
been
able
to
make
the
meaning
more
clear
and
more
effective
any
young
pianist
who
aspires
to
have
his
hands
in
condition
to
respond
to
the
subtle
suggestions
of
his
brain
may
acquire
a
marvelous
foundation
by
the
use
of
scales
bach
and
arpeggios
the
old
that
is
ever
new
i
have
seen
many
ways
and
means
tried
out
some
seem
like
an
attempt
to
save
time
at
the
expense
of
thoroughness
furthermore
the
means
which
have
produced
the
great
pianists
of
the
past
are
likely
to
differ
but
little
from
those
which
will
produce
the
pianists
of
the
future
the
teacher
who
is
inclined
to
think
scales
should
go
to
hear
de
pachmann
who
practices
scales
every
day
de
pachmann
who
has
been
a
virtuoso
for
a
great
many
years
still
finds
daily
practice
necessary
and
in
addition
to
scales
he
plays
a
great
deal
of
bach
his
technic
is
more
powerful
and
more
comprehensive
than
ever
and
he
attributes
it
in
a
large
measure
to
the
simplest
of
means
difficulties
in
new
pianoforte
compositions
i
have
often
been
asked
if
the
future
of
pianoforte
composition
seemed
destined
to
alter
the
technic
of
the
instrument
as
did
the
compositions
of
liszt
for
instance
this
is
a
difficult
question
but
it
would
seem
that
the
borderland
of
pianistic
difficulty
had
been
reached
in
the
compositions
and
transcriptions
of
busoni
and
godowsky
the
new
french
school
of
debussy
ravel
and
others
is
different
in
type
but
does
not
make
any
more
severe
technical
demands
however
it
is
hard
for
one
to
imagine
anything
more
complicated
or
more
difficult
than
the
godowsky
arrangements
of
the
chopin
studies
i
fail
to
see
how
pianoforte
technic
can
go
much
beyond
these
unless
one
gets
more
fingers
or
more
hands
godowsky
treatment
of
these
studies
is
marvelous
not
only
from
a
technical
standpoint
but
from
a
musical
standpoint
as
well
he
has
added
a
new
flavor
to
the
individual
masterpieces
of
chopin
he
has
made
them
wonderfully
clever
and
really
very
interesting
studies
in
harmony
and
counterpoint
so
that
one
forgets
their
technical
intricacies
in
the
beauty
of
the
compositions
one
can
not
say
that
their
original
beauty
has
been
enhanced
but
he
has
made
them
wonderfully
fascinating
compositions
despite
their
aggravating
complications
for
the
student
mere
difficulty
no
longer
astounds
the
day
when
the
show
of
startling
technical
skill
was
sufficient
to
make
a
reputation
for
a
pianist
is
fortunately
past
the
mechanical
playing
devices
have
possibly
been
responsible
for
this
the
public
refuses
to
admire
anything
that
can
be
done
by
a
machine
and
longs
for
something
finer
more
subtle
more
closely
allied
to
the
soul
of
the
artist
this
does
not
mean
however
that
the
necessity
for
a
comprehensive
technic
is
depreciated
quite
the
contrary
is
true
the
need
for
an
technic
is
greater
than
ever
before
but
the
public
demand
for
the
purely
musical
the
purely
artistic
is
being
continually
manifested
modern
composers
are
writing
with
this
in
view
rather
than
huge
technical
combinations
the
giant
of
to
my
mind
is
indisputably
rachmaninoff
he
is
writing
the
greatest
original
music
for
piano
of
any
living
composer
all
of
his
compositions
are
pianistic
and
he
does
not
condescend
to
pander
to
a
trifling
public
taste
he
is
a
man
with
a
great
mind
and
in
addition
to
this
he
has
a
delightful
sense
of
proportion
and
a
feeling
for
the
beautiful
all
of
which
makes
him
a
composer
of
the
master
mould
his
compositions
will
endure
as
long
as
music
modern
compositions
for
others
of
the
type
of
scriabine
i
care
less
although
i
am
sensible
to
the
beauty
of
many
of
their
compositions
they
have
not
however
the
splendid
mould
of
rachmaninoff
nor
have
they
his
vigorous
originality
doubtless
some
of
these
men
will
produce
great
original
compositions
in
the
future
compositions
that
are
simply
not
bad
are
hardly
worth
the
paper
they
are
written
upon
for
they
will
not
last
as
long
the
composition
that
will
last
is
a
great
new
original
thought
inspired
noble
and
elemental
but
worked
out
with
the
distinctive
craftsmanship
of
the
great
master
i
am
very
partial
to
debussy
he
has
an
extraordinary
atmosphere
and
after
one
has
formed
a
taste
for
him
his
compositions
are
alluring
particularly
his
à
sous
la
and
cahier
which
i
have
been
playing
upon
my
american
tour
the
most
difficult
compositions
i
have
continually
been
asked
is
the
most
difficult
composition
the
question
always
amuses
me
but
i
suppose
it
is
very
human
and
in
line
with
the
desire
to
measure
the
highest
building
the
tallest
mountain
the
longest
river
or
the
oldest
castle
why
is
such
a
premium
put
upon
mere
difficulty
strange
to
say
no
one
ever
seems
to
think
it
necessary
to
inquire
is
the
most
beautiful
piece
difficulty
in
music
should
by
no
means
be
estimated
by
technical
complications
to
play
a
mozart
concerto
well
is
a
colossally
difficult
undertaking
the
pianist
who
has
worked
for
hours
to
get
such
a
composition
as
near
as
possible
to
his
conception
of
perfection
is
never
given
the
credit
for
his
work
except
by
a
few
connoisseurs
many
of
whom
have
been
through
a
similarly
exacting
experience
months
may
be
spent
upon
comparatively
simple
compositions
such
as
the
haydn
sonatas
or
the
mozart
sonatas
and
the
musical
public
is
blind
to
the
additional
finish
or
polish
so
evident
to
the
virtuoso
praise
that
irritates
the
opposite
of
this
is
also
true
a
little
show
of
bravura
possibly
in
a
passage
which
has
not
cost
the
pianist
more
than
ten
minutes
of
frivolous
practice
will
turn
many
of
the
unthinking
auditors
into
a
roaring
mob
this
is
of
course
very
distressing
to
the
sincere
artist
who
strives
to
establish
himself
by
his
real
worth
of
course
there
are
some
compositions
which
present
difficulties
which
few
work
hard
enough
to
surmount
among
these
might
be
mentioned
the
particularly
the
in
a
flat
opus
no
which
is
always
especially
exasperating
for
the
student
sufficiently
advanced
to
approach
it
the
juan
of
liszt
the
and
the
beethoven
opus
which
when
properly
played
demands
enormous
technical
skill
one
certainly
saves
a
lot
of
bother
when
one
discards
it
from
one
repertoire
if
these
four
pieces
are
not
the
most
difficult
pieces
they
are
certainly
among
the
most
difficult
why
not
seek
the
beautiful
but
why
seek
difficulty
when
there
is
so
much
that
is
quite
as
beautiful
and
yet
not
difficult
why
try
to
make
a
bouquet
of
oak
trees
when
the
ground
is
covered
with
exquisite
flowers
the
piano
is
a
solo
instrument
and
has
its
limitations
some
piano
music
is
said
to
sound
orchestral
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
great
deal
of
it
would
sound
better
with
the
orchestra
real
piano
music
is
rare
the
piano
appears
to
be
too
small
for
some
of
our
modern
titans
among
the
composers
when
they
write
for
the
piano
they
seem
to
be
exhibiting
a
concealed
longing
for
the
one
hundred
or
more
men
of
the
modern
orchestra
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
works
of
debussy
appeal
to
me
is
that
he
manages
to
put
so
much
color
into
his
piano
pieces
without
suggesting
the
orchestra
much
of
his
music
is
wonderful
in
this
respect
and
moreover
the
musicians
of
the
future
will
appreciate
this
fact
more
and
more
exercises
that
give
immediate
help
no
one
exercise
can
be
depended
upon
to
meet
all
the
varied
conditions
which
arise
in
the
practice
of
the
day
but
i
have
frequently
employed
a
simple
exercise
which
seems
to
the
hand
into
muscular
activity
in
a
very
short
time
it
is
so
simple
that
i
am
diffident
about
suggesting
it
however
elemental
processes
lead
to
large
structures
sometimes
the
egyptian
pyramids
were
built
ages
before
the
age
of
steam
and
electricity
and
scientists
are
still
wondering
how
those
massive
stones
were
ever
put
in
place
the
exercise
i
use
most
apart
from
scales
is
really
based
upon
a
principle
which
is
constantly
employed
in
all
scale
playing
and
in
all
piano
playing
that
of
putting
the
thumb
over
and
under
the
fingers
did
you
ever
stop
to
think
how
continually
this
is
employed
one
hardly
goes
one
step
beyond
the
elemental
grades
before
one
encounters
it
it
demands
a
muscular
action
entirely
different
from
that
of
pressing
down
the
keys
either
with
the
finger
forearm
or
arm
motion
starting
with
the
principle
and
devising
new
exercises
to
meet
the
very
human
need
for
variety
i
play
something
like
this
illustration
the
next
form
would
employ
another
fingering
illustration
the
next
form
might
be
illustration
these
i
transpose
through
several
keys
for
instance
illustration
note
that
i
am
not
giving
an
arbitrary
exercise
but
simply
suggesting
the
plan
upon
which
the
student
may
work
there
is
a
great
deal
of
fun
in
devising
new
exercises
it
assists
in
helping
the
student
to
concentrate
of
course
these
exercises
are
only
attempted
after
all
the
standard
exercises
found
in
books
have
been
exhausted
avoid
too
complicated
exercises
i
often
think
that
teachers
make
a
great
mistake
by
giving
too
complicated
exercises
a
complicated
exercise
leads
away
from
clear
thinking
and
concentration
the
simple
exercise
will
never
seem
dull
or
dry
if
the
pupil
ambition
is
right
after
all
it
is
not
so
much
what
is
done
as
how
it
is
done
give
less
thought
to
the
material
and
more
to
the
correction
of
the
means
with
which
one
plays
there
should
be
unceasing
variety
in
studies
a
change
at
every
practice
period
is
advisable
as
it
gives
the
pupil
new
material
for
thought
there
are
hundreds
of
different
exercises
in
the
different

biographical
harold
bauer
was
born
in
london
england
april
his
father
was
an
accomplished
amateur
violinist
through
him
the
future
virtuoso
was
enabled
to
gain
an
excellent
idea
of
the
beautiful
literature
of
chamber
music
when
a
boy
bauer
studied
privately
with
the
celebrated
violin
teacher
politzer
at
the
age
of
ten
he
became
so
proficient
that
he
made
his
as
a
violinist
in
london
thereafter
in
his
tours
of
england
he
met
with
great
success
everywhere
in
the
artistic
circles
of
london
bauer
met
a
musician
named
graham
moore
who
gave
him
some
idea
upon
the
details
of
the
technic
of
pianoforte
playing
which
bauer
had
studied
or
rather
picked
up
by
himself
without
any
thought
of
ever
abandoning
his
career
as
a
violinist
moore
had
expected
to
rehearse
some
orchestral
accompaniments
on
a
second
piano
with
paderewski
who
was
then
preparing
some
concertos
for
public
performance
moore
was
taken
ill
and
sent
his
talented
musical
friend
bauer
in
his
place
paderewski
immediately
took
an
interest
in
his
talented
accompanist
and
advised
him
to
go
to
paris
to
continue
his
studies
with
gorski
after
many
privations
in
paris
bauer
unable
to
secure
engagements
as
a
violinist
went
on
a
tour
of
russia
as
an
accompanist
of
a
singer
in
some
of
the
smaller
towns
bauer
played
an
occasional
piano
solo
returning
to
paris
he
found
that
he
was
still
unable
to
secure
engagements
as
a
violinist
his
pianistic
opportunity
came
when
a
celebrated
virtuoso
who
was
to
play
at
a
concert
was
taken
ill
and
bauer
was
asked
to
substitute
he
gradually
gave
more
attention
to
the
piano
and
rose
to
a
very
high
position

harold

the
immediate
relation
of
technic
to
music
while
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
talk
to
the
great
number
of
students
studying
the
piano
i
can
assure
you
that
it
is
with
no
little
diffidence
that
i
venture
to
approach
these
very
subjects
about
which
they
are
probably
most
anxious
to
learn
in
the
first
place
words
tell
very
little
and
in
the
second
place
my
whole
career
has
been
so
different
from
the
orthodox
methods
that
i
have
been
constantly
compelled
to
contrive
means
of
my
own
to
meet
the
myriads
of
artistic
contingencies
as
they
have
arisen
in
my
work
it
is
largely
for
this
reason
that
i
felt
compelled
recently
to
refuse
a
very
flattering
offer
to
write
a
book
on
piano
playing
my
whole
life
experience
makes
me
incapable
of
perceiving
what
the
normal
methods
of
pianistic
study
should
be
as
a
result
of
this
i
am
obliged
with
my
own
pupils
to
invent
continually
new
means
and
new
plans
for
work
with
each
student
without
the
conventional
technical
basis
to
work
upon
this
has
necessarily
resulted
in
several
aspects
of
pianoforte
study
which
are
naturally
somewhat
different
from
the
commonly
accepted
ideas
of
the
technicians
in
the
first
place
the
only
technical
study
of
any
kind
i
have
ever
done
has
been
that
technic
which
has
had
an
immediate
relation
to
the
musical
message
of
the
piece
i
have
been
studying
in
other
words
i
have
never
studied
technic
independently
of
music
i
do
not
condemn
the
ordinary
technical
methods
for
those
who
desire
to
use
them
and
see
good
in
them
i
fear
however
that
i
am
unable
to
discuss
them
adequately
as
they
are
outside
of
my
personal
experience
the
aim
of
technic
when
as
a
result
of
circumstances
entirely
beyond
my
control
i
abandoned
the
study
of
the
violin
in
order
to
become
a
pianist
i
was
forced
to
realize
in
view
of
my
very
imperfect
technical
equipment
that
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunities
that
offered
for
public
performance
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
find
some
means
of
making
my
playing
acceptable
without
spending
months
and
probably
years
in
acquiring
mechanical
proficiency
the
only
way
of
overcoming
the
difficulty
seemed
to
be
to
devote
myself
entirely
to
the
musical
essentials
of
the
composition
i
was
interpreting
in
the
hope
that
the
purely
technical
deficiencies
which
i
had
neither
time
nor
knowledge
to
enable
me
to
correct
would
pass
comparatively
unnoticed
provided
i
was
able
to
give
sufficient
interest
and
compel
sufficient
attention
to
the
emotional
values
of
the
work
this
kind
of
study
forced
upon
me
in
the
first
instance
through
reasons
of
expediency
became
a
habit
and
gradually
grew
into
a
conviction
that
it
was
a
mistake
to
practice
technic
at
all
unless
such
practice
should
conduce
to
some
definite
specific
and
immediate
musical
result
i
do
not
wish
to
be
misunderstood
in
making
this
statement
containing
as
it
does
an
expression
of
opinion
that
was
formed
in
early
years
of
study
but
which
nevertheless
i
have
never
since
felt
any
reason
to
change
it
is
not
my
intention
to
imply
that
technical
study
is
unnecessary
or
that
purely
muscular
training
is
to
be
neglected
i
mean
simply
to
say
that
in
every
detail
of
technical
work
the
germ
of
musical
expression
must
be
discovered
and
cultivated
and
that
in
muscular
training
for
force
and
independence
the
simplest
possible
forms
of
physical
exercises
are
all
that
is
necessary
the
singer
and
the
violinist
are
always
studying
even
when
they
practice
a
succession
of
single
notes
not
so
with
the
pianist
however
for
an
isolated
note
on
the
piano
whether
played
by
the
most
accomplished
artist
or
the
man
in
the
street
means
nothing
absolutely
nothing
seeking
individual
expression
at
the
time
of
which
i
speak
my
greatest
difficulty
was
naturally
to
give
a
constant
and
definite
direction
to
my
work
and
in
my
efforts
to
obtain
a
suitable
muscular
training
which
should
enable
me
to
produce
expressive
sounds
while
i
neglected
no
opportunity
of
closely
observing
the
work
of
pianoforte
teachers
and
students
around
me
i
found
that
most
of
the
technical
work
which
was
being
done
with
infinite
pains
and
a
vast
expenditure
of
time
was
not
only
of
expressive
sounds
but
actually
harmful
and
misleading
as
regards
the
development
of
the
musical
sense
i
could
see
no
object
in
practicing
evenness
in
scales
considering
that
a
perfectly
even
scale
is
essentially
devoid
of
emotional
musical
significance
i
could
see
no
reason
for
limiting
tone
production
to
a
certain
kind
of
sound
that
was
called
good
tone
since
the
expression
of
feeling
necessarily
demands
in
many
cases
the
use
of
relatively
harsh
sounds
moreover
i
could
see
no
reason
for
trying
to
overcome
what
are
generally
called
natural
defects
such
as
the
comparative
weakness
of
the
fourth
finger
for
example
as
it
seemed
to
me
rather
a
good
thing
than
otherwise
that
each
finger
should
naturally
and
normally
possess
a
characteristic
motion
of
its
own
it
is
that
count
in
art
not
similarities
every
individual
expression
is
a
form
of
art
why
not
then
make
an
artist
of
each
finger
by
cultivating
its
special
aptitudes
instead
of
adapting
a
system
of
training
deliberately
calculated
to
destroy
these
individual
characteristics
in
bringing
the
fingers
to
a
common
level
of
lifeless
machines
these
and
similar
reflections
i
discovered
were
carrying
me
continually
farther
away
from
the
ideals
of
most
of
the
pianists
students
and
teachers
with
whom
i
was
in
contact
and
it
was
not
long
before
i
definitely
abandoned
all
hope
of
obtaining
by
any
of
the
means
i
found
in
use
the
results
for
which
i
was
striving
consequently
from
that
time
to
the
present
my
work
has
necessarily
been
more
or
less
independent
and
empirical
in
its
nature
and
while
i
trust
i
am
neither
prejudiced
nor
intolerant
in
my
attitude
towards
pianoforte
education
in
its
general
aspect
i
can
not
help
feeling
that
a
great
deal
of
natural
taste
is
stifled
and
a
great
deal
of
mediocrity
created
by
the
persistent
and
unintelligent
study
of
such
things
as
an
scale
or
a
tone
lastly
it
is
quite
incomprehensible
to
me
why
any
one
method
of
technic
should
be
superior
to
any
other
considering
that
as
far
as
i
was
able
to
judge
no
teacher
or
pupil
ever
claimed
more
for
any
technical
system
than
that
it
gave
more
technical
ability
than
some
other
technical
system
i
have
never
been
able
to
convince
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
one
system
does
give
more
ability
than
another
but
even
if
there
were
one
infinitely
superior
to
all
the
rest
it
would
still
fail
to
satisfy
me
unless
its
whole
aim
and
object
were
to
facilitate
musical
expression
naturally
studying
in
this
way
required
my
powers
of
concentration
to
be
trained
to
the
very
highest
point
this
matter
of
concentration
is
far
more
important
than
most
teachers
imagine
and
the
perusal
of
some
standard
work
on
psychology
will
reveal
things
which
should
help
the
student
greatly
many
pupils
make
the
mistake
of
thinking
that
only
a
certain
kind
of
music
demands
concentration
whereas
it
is
quite
as
necessary
to
concentrate
the
mind
upon
the
playing
of
a
simple
scale
as
for
the
study
of
a
beethoven
sonata
the
resistance
of
the
medium
in
every
form
of
art
the
medium
that
is
employed
offers
a
certain
resistance
to
perfect
freedom
of
expression
and
the
nature
of
this
resistance
must
be
fully
understood
before
it
can
be
overcome
the
poet
the
painter
the
sculptor
and
the
musician
each
has
his
own
problem
to
solve
and
the
pianist
in
particular
is
frequently
brought
to
the
verge
of
despair
through
the
fact
that
the
instrument
in
requiring
the
expenditure
of
physical
and
nervous
energy
absorbs
so
to
speak
a
large
proportion
of
the
intensity
which
the
music
demands
with
many
students
the
piano
is
only
a
barrier
a
wall
between
them
and
music
their
thoughts
never
seem
to
penetrate
farther
than
the
keys
they
plod
along
for
years
apparently
striving
to
make
machines
of
themselves
and
in
the
end
result
in
becoming
something
rather
inferior
conditions
are
doubtless
better
now
than
in
former
years
teachers
give
studies
with
some
musical
value
and
the
months
even
years
of
keyboard
grind
without
the
least
suggestion
of
anything
musical
or
gratifying
to
the
natural
sense
of
the
beautiful
are
very
probably
a
thing
of
the
past
but
here
again
i
fear
the
teachers
in
many
cases
make
a
perverted
use
of
studies
and
pieces
for
technical
purposes
if
we
practice
a
piece
of
real
music
with
no
other
idea
than
that
of
developing
some
technical
point
it
often
ceases
to
become
a
piece
of
music
and
results
in
being
a
kind
of
technical
machinery
once
a
piece
is
mechanical
it
is
difficult
to
make
it
otherwise
all
the
cogs
wheels
bolts
and
screws
which
an
overzealous
ambition
to
become
perfect
technically
has
built
up
are
made
so
evident
that
only
the
most
patient
and
enduring
kind
of
an
audience
can
tolerate
them
the
perversion
of
studies
people
talk
about
the
music
of
bach
to
accomplish
some
technical
purpose
in
a
perfectly
manner
they
never
seem
to
think
of
interpreting
bach
but
rather
make
of
him
a
kind
of
technical
elevator
by
means
of
which
they
hope
to
reach
some
marvelous
musical
heights
we
even
hear
of
the
studies
of
chopin
being
perverted
in
a
similarly
vicious
manner
but
bach
the
master
of
masters
is
the
greatest
sufferer
it
has
become
a
truism
to
say
that
technic
is
only
a
means
to
an
end
but
i
very
much
doubt
if
this
assertion
should
be
accepted
without
question
suggesting
as
it
does
the
advisability
of
studying
something
that
is
not
music
and
which
is
believed
at
some
future
time
to
be
capable
of
being
marvelously
transformed
into
an
artistic
expression
properly
understood
is
and
must
be
studied
as
such
there
should
be
no
technic
in
music
which
is
not
music
the
unit
of
musical
expression
the
piano
is
of
all
instruments
the
least
expressive
naturally
and
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
that
the
student
should
realize
the
nature
of
its
resistance
the
action
of
a
piano
is
purely
a
piece
of
machinery
where
the
individual
note
has
no
meaning
when
the
key
is
once
struck
and
the
note
sounded
there
is
a
completed
action
and
the
note
can
not
then
be
modified
nor
changed
in
the
least
the
only
thing
over
which
the
pianist
has
any
control
is
the
length
of
the
tone
and
this
again
may
not
last
any
longer
than
the
natural
vibrations
of
the
strings
although
it
may
be
shortened
by
relinquishing
the
keys
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
individual
note
is
struck
by
a
child
or
by
paderewski
it
has
in
itself
no
expressive
value
in
the
case
of
the
violin
the
voice
and
all
other
instruments
except
the
organ
the
individual
note
may
be
modified
after
it
is
emitted
or
struck
and
in
this
modification
is
contained
the
possibility
of
a
whole
world
of
emotional
expression
our
sole
means
of
expression
then
in
piano
playing
lies
in
the
relation
of
one
note
to
the
other
notes
in
a
series
or
in
a
chord
herein
lies
the
difficulty
the
resistance
to
perfect
freedom
of
which
i
have
spoken
before
the
principal
subject
for
intelligence
and
careful
study
and
yet
so
few
students
appear
to
understand
it
their
great
effort
seems
to
be
to
make
all
the
noise
in
a
given
series
as
much
alike
as
coins
from
a
mint
they
come
to
the
piano
as
their
only
instrument
and
never
seek
to
take
a
lesson
from
the
voice
or
from
the
other
instruments
which
have
expressive
resources
infinitely
superior
to
those
possessed
by
the
piano
the
principal
charm
of
the
piano
lies
in
the
command
which
the
player
has
over
many
voices
singing
together
but
until
the
pianist
has
a
regard
for
the
individual
voice
in
its
relation
to
the
ensemble
he
has
no
means
with
which
to
make
his
work
really
beautiful
there
is
a
great
need
for
more
breadth
in
music
study
this
as
i
know
has
been
said
very
often
but
it
does
not
hurt
to
say
it
again
the
more
a
man
knows
the
more
he
has
experienced
the
wider
his
mental
vision
in
all
branches
of
human
information
the
more
he
will
have
to
say
we
need
men
in
music
with
big
minds
wide
grasp
and
definite
aims
musicians
are
far
too
prone
to
become
overspecialized
they
seem
to
have
an
unquenchable
thirst
to
master
the
jargon
and
the
infinite
variety
of
methods
which
are
thrust
upon
us
in
these
days
rather
than
a
genuine
desire
to
develop
their
musical
aims
music
is
acquiring
a
technology
as
confusing
and
as
extensive
as
bacteriology
there
seems
to
be
no
end
to
the
new
kinds
of
methods
in
the
minds
of
furtive
and
fertile
inventors
each
new
method
in
turn
seems
to
breed
another
and
so
on
among
other
things
i
would
suggest
the
advisability
for
pianists
to
cultivate
some
knowledge
of
the
construction
of
their
instrument
strange
as
it
may
seem
it
is
nevertheless
a
fact
that
the
average
pianist
knows
practically
nothing
of
a
piano
being
in
many
cases
entirely
unaware
of
such
simple
things
as
how
the
tone
is
produced
the
function
of
the
pedals
is
as
unknown
to
them
as
geology
is
to
the
coal
heaver
this
ignorance
leads
frequently
to
the
employment
of
motions
and
methods
that
can
only
be
characterized
as
ridiculous
in
the
extreme
music
first
the
instrument
afterwards
from
the
manner
in
which
many
ambitious
and
earnest
students
play
it
would
seem
that
they
had
their
minds
fixed
upon
something
which
could
not
be
conveyed
to
the
world
in
any
other
form
than
that
of
the
sounds
which
come
from
the
piano
of
course
the
piano
has
an
idiom
peculiarly
its
own
and
some
composers
have
employed
this
idiom
with
such
natural
freedom
that
their
music
suffers
when
transposed
for
any
other
instrument
the
music
of
chopin
is
peculiarly
pianistic
but
it
is
first
of
all
music
and
any
one
of
the
wonderful
melodies
which
came
from
the
fertile
brain
of
the
genius
could
be
played
upon
one
of
many
different
instruments
besides
the
piano
the
duty
of
the
interpreter
should
surely
be
to
think
of
the
composition
as
such
and
to
interpret
it
primarily
as
music
irrespective
of
the
instrument
some
students
sit
down
before
the
keyboard
to
the
piano
precisely
as
though
they
were
going
to
play
a
game
of
cards
they
have
learned
certain
rules
governing
the
game
and
they
do
not
dare
disobey
these
rules
they
think
of
rules
rather
than
of
the
ultimate
result
the
music
itself
the
idiom
of
the
italian
language
is
appropriate
here
the
italians
do
not
say
play
the
piano
but
rather
sound
the
piano
il
if
we
had
a
little
more
of
the
piano
that
is
producing
real
musical
effects
and
a
little
less
playing
on
ivory
keys
the
playing
of
our
students
would
be
more
interesting
variety
the
spice
of
art
it
can
hardly
be
questioned
that
the
genesis
of
all
musical
art
is
to
be
found
in
song
the
most
natural
the
most
fluent
and
the
most
beautiful
form
of
musical
expression
how
much
every
instrumentalist
can
learn
from
the
art
of
singing
it
is
a
physical
impossibility
for
the
voice
to
produce
two
notes
in
succession
exactly
alike
they
may
sound
very
similar
but
there
is
a
difference
quite
perceptible
to
the
highly
trained
ear
when
a
singer
starts
a
phrase
a
certain
amount
of
motive
power
is
required
to
set
the
vocal
apparatus
in
vibration
after
the
first
note
has
been
attacked
with
the
full
force
of
the
breath
there
is
naturally
not
so
much
weight
or
pressure
left
for
the
following
notes
it
is
however
possible
for
the
second
note
to
be
as
loud
or
even
louder
than
the
first
note
but
in
order
to
obtain
the
additional
force
on
the
second
note
it
is
necessary
to
compensate
for
the
lack
of
force
due
to
the
loss
of
the
original
weight
or
pressure
by
increasing
what
might
be
called
the
nervous
energy
that
is
to
say
by
expelling
the
breath
with
proportionately
greater
speed
muscular
and
nervous
energy
the
manifestation
of
nervous
energy
in
this
manner
is
quite
different
from
the
manifestation
of
muscular
energy
although
both
are
of
course
intimately
connected
muscular
energy
begins
at
its
maximum
and
gradually
diminishes
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
whereas
nervous
energy
rises
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
of
time
to
its
climax
and
then
drops
immediately
to
nothing
nervous
energy
may
be
said
to
be
represented
by
an
increased
rapidity
of
emission
it
is
what
the
athlete
would
call
a
what
i
have
said
about
the
voice
applies
equally
to
all
other
instruments
the
piano
and
the
organ
alone
excepted
it
is
obvious
that
the
playing
of
the
wind
instruments
must
be
subjected
to
the
limitations
of
the
breath
and
in
the
case
of
the
violin
and
the
other
stringed
instruments
where
the
bow
supplies
the
motive
power
it
is
impossible
for
two
notes
played
in
succession
to
sound
absolutely
alike
if
the
first
note
of
a
phrase
is
attacked
with
the
weight
of
the
whole
bow
behind
it
the
second
note
will
follow
with
just
so
much
less
weight
and
if
the
violinist
desires
to
intensify
any
of
the
succeeding
tones
he
must
do
so
by
the
employment
of
the
nervous
energy
i
have
mentioned
when
a
difference
in
the
quality
of
tone
is
bound
to
result
the
pianist
should
closely
observe
and
endeavor
to
imitate
these
characteristics
which
so
vividly
convey
the
idea
of
organic
life
in
all
its
infinite
variety
and
which
are
inherent
in
every
medium
for
artistic
expression
phrasing
and
breathing
it
would
take
a
book
and
by
no
means
a
small
one
to
go
into
this
matter
of
phrasing
which
i
am
now
discussing
even
in
such
a
book
there
would
doubtless
be
many
points
which
would
be
open
to
assaults
for
sticklers
in
psychological
technology
i
am
not
issuing
a
propaganda
or
writing
a
thesis
for
the
purpose
of
having
something
to
defend
but
merely
giving
a
few
offhand
facts
that
have
benefited
me
in
my
work
however
it
is
my
conviction
that
it
is
the
duty
of
the
pianist
to
try
to
understand
the
analogy
to
the
physical
limitations
which
surround
the
more
natural
mediums
of
musical
expression
the
voice
and
the
violin
and
to
apply
the
result
of
his
observations
to
his
piano
playing
the
natural
effect
of
emotions
there
is
another
relation
between
phrasing
and
breathing
which
the
student
may
investigate
to
advantage
the
emotions
have
a
direct
and
immediate
effect
upon
the
breath
and
as
the
brain
informs
the
nervous
system
of
new
emotional
impressions
the
visible
evidences
may
be
first
observed
in
the
breathing
it
is
quite
unnecessary
to
go
into
the
physiology
or
psychology
of
this
but
a
little
reflection
will
immediately
indicate
what
i
mean
it
is
impossible
to
witness
a
disastrous
accident
without
showing
mental
agitation
and
excitement
in
hurried
breathing
joy
anger
fear
love
tranquillity
and
grief
all
are
characterized
by
different
modes
of
breathing
and
a
trained
actor
must
study
this
with
great
closeness
the
artist
at
the
piano
may
be
said
to
breathe
his
phrases
a
phrase
that
is
purely
contemplative
in
character
is
breathed
in
a
tranquil
fashion
without
any
suggestion
of
nervous
agitation
if
we
go
through
the
scale
of
expression
starting
with
contemplative
tranquillity
to
the
climax
of
dramatic
intensity
the
breath
will
be
emitted
progressively
quicker
and
quicker
every
musical
phrase
has
some
kind
of
expressive
message
to
deliver
if
a
perfectly
tranquil
phrase
is
given
out
in
a
succession
of
short
breaths
indicating
as
they
would
agitation
it
would
be
a
contradiction
just
as
it
would
be
perfectly
inhuman
to
suppose
that
in
expressing
dramatic
intensity
it
would
be
possible
to
breathe
slowly
in
conclusion
i
would
urge
students
to
cultivate
a
very
definite
mental
attitude
as
to
what
they
really
desire
to
accomplish
do
you
wish
to
make
music
if
so
music
and
nothing
but
music
all
the
time
down
to
the
smallest
detail
even
in
technic
is
your
ambition
to
play
scales
octaves
double
notes
and
trills
then
by
all
means
concentrate
your
mind
on
them
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
but
do
not
be
surprised
if
when
later
on
you
want
to
communicate
a
semblance
of
life
to
your
mechanical
motions
you
succeed
in
obtaining
no
more
than
the
jerky
movements

two

took
her
to

her
first
teachers
in

were

at

age
of

she
made

two
years

had
the
good

to
meet
mme

advised
her
to
go
to
vienna
to
study
with
theodore

accordingly
she
was
taken
to
the
austrian
capital
and
remained
under
the
instruction
of
the
noted
pedagogue
for
five
years
starting
with
the

she
commenced
a

arousing
great
enthusiasm
wherever
she
appeared
her
emotional
force
her
personal

the
secret
of
success
in
the
career
of
a
virtuoso
is
not
easily
defined
many
elements
have
to
be
considered
given
great
talent
success
is
not
by
any
means
assured
many
seemingly
extraneous
qualities
must
be
cultivated
many
mistakes
must
be
avoided
let
me
start
out
with
a
caution
no
greater
mistake
could
possibly
be
made
than
to
assume
that
frequent
public
appearances
or
extended
concert
touring
in
early
youth
is
essential
to
a
great
career
as
a
virtuoso
on
the
contrary
i
would
say
that
such
a
course
is
positively
harmful
the
of
frequent
playing
in
public
is
essential
if
one
would
get
rid
of
stage
fright
or
undue
nervousness
and
would
gain
that
repose
and
without
which
success
is
impossible
but
such
experience
should
be
had
only
after
the
attainment
of
physical
and
mental
maturity
a
young
boy
or
girl
though
ever
so
much
of
a
prodigy
if
taken
on
an
extensive
concert
tour
not
only
becomes
unduly
conceited
vain
and
easily
satisfied
with
his
or
her
work
but
and
this
is
the
point
runs
the
risk
of
undermining
his
or
her
health
the
precious
days
of
youth
should
be
devoted
primarily
to
the
storing
up
of
health
without
which
lasting
success
is
impossible
nothing
is
more
harmful
to
sound
physical
development
and
mental
growth
than
the
strain
of
extensive
tours
it
is
true
that
one
great
virtuoso
now
before
the
public
played
frequently
before
large
audiences
as
an
infant
prodigy
but
happily
wise
and
efficient
influences
served
to
check
this
mad
career
the
young
artist
was
placed
in
the
hands
of
a
great
teacher
and
given
a
chance
to
reach
full
physical
maturity
and
artistic
stature
before
resuming
public
appearances
had
it
been
otherwise
it
is
a
matter
of
common
belief
that
this
great
talent
would
have
fizzled
out
by
this
i
do
not
mean
that
the
pupil
should
be
prevented
from
playing
at
recitals
in
the
home
city
playing
of
this
kind
gives
the
pupil
confidence
and
smooths
the
way
for
his
work
as
a
mature
artist
these
performances
should
be
rare
except
in
the
case
of
performances
given
in
the
home
of
the
pupil
or
at
the
teacher
home
what
i
object
to
is
the
exploitation
on
a
large
scale
of
the
infant
prodigy
thorough
preparation
necessary
one
of
the
real
secrets
of
success
in
public
appearance
is
thorough
preparation
in
fact
there
is
no
talisman
no
secret
that
one
can
pass
over
to
another
and
say
is
my
secret
go
thou
and
do
likewise
what
a
valuable
secret
it
would
be
the
mysterious
secret
processes
of
the
krupp
gun
works
in
germany
would
be
trifling
in
comparison
genuine
worth
is
after
all
the
great
essential
and
thorough
preparation
leads
to
genuine
worth
for
instance
i
have
long
felt
that
the
mental
technic
that
the
study
of
bach
inventions
and
fugues
afford
could
not
be
supplied
by
any
other
means
the
peculiar
polyphonic
character
of
these
works
trains
the
mind
to
recognize
the
separate
themes
so
ingeniously
and
beautifully
interwoven
and
at
the
same
time
the
fingers
receive
a
kind
of
discipline
which
hardly
any
other
study
can
secure
the
layman
can
hardly
conceive
how
difficult
it
is
to
play
at
the
same
time
two
themes
different
in
character
and
running
in
opposite
directions
the
student
fully
realizes
this
difficulty
when
he
finds
that
it
takes
years
to
master
it
these
separate
themes
must
be
individualized
they
must
be
conceived
as
separate
but
their
bearing
upon
the
work
as
a
whole
must
never
be
overlooked
the
purity
of
style
to
be
found
in
bach
in
connection
with
his
marvelous
contrapuntal
designs
should
be
expounded
to
the
student
at
as
early
an
age
as
his
intellectual
development
will
permit
it
may
take
some
time
to
create
a
taste
for
bach
but
the
teacher
will
be
rewarded
with
results
so
substantial
and
permanent
that
all
the
trouble
and
time
will
seem
well
worth
while
there
is
also
a
refining
influence
about
which
i
would
like
to
speak
the
practice
of
bach
seems
to
fairly
grind
off
the
rough
edges
and
instead
of
a
raw
bungling
technic
the
student
acquires
a
kind
of
finish
from
the
study
of
the
old
master
of
eisenach
that
nothing
else
can
give
him
i
do
not
mean
to
be
understood
that
the
study
of
bach
even
if
it
be
ever
so
thorough
suffices
in
itself
to
give
one
a
perfect
technic
vastly
more
is
necessary
the
student
who
would
fit
himself
for
a
concert
career
must
have
the
advice
of
a
great
teacher
and
must
work
incessantly
and
conscientiously
under
his
guidance
i
emphasize
the
study
of
bach
merely
because
i
find
it
is
not
pursued
as
much
as
it
deserves
that
technical
finish
is
of
the
very
essence
of
success
in
public
appearance
goes
without
saying
it
is
not
only
indispensable
for
a
creditable
performance
but
the
consciousness
of
possessing
it
contributes
to
that
confidence
of
the
player
without
which
he
can
not
hope
to
make
an
impression
upon
his
audience
leschetizky
and
speaking
about
teachers
reminds
me
to
put
forth
this
caution
do
not
pin
your
faith
to
a
method
there
is
good
and
alas
some
bad
in
most
methods
we
hear
a
great
deal
these
days
about
the
leschetizky
method
during
the
five
years
i
was
with
leschetizky
he
made
it
very
plain
that
he
had
no
fixed
method
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
like
every
good
teacher
he
studied
the
individuality
of
each
pupil
and
taught
him
according
to
that
individuality
it
might
almost
be
said
that
he
had
a
different
method
for
each
pupil
and
i
have
often
said
that
leschetizky
method
is
to
have
no
fixed
method
of
course
there
are
certain
preparatory
exercises
which
with
slight
variations
he
wants
all
his
pupils
to
go
through
but
it
is
not
so
much
the
exercises
in
themselves
as
the
patience
and
painful
persistence
in
executing
them
to
which
they
owe
their
virtue
of
course
leschetizky
has
his
preference
for
certain
works
for
their
great
educational
value
he
has
his
convictions
as
to
the
true
interpretation
to
be
given
to
the
various
compositions
but
those
do
not
form
what
may
properly
be
called
a
method
personally
i
am
rather
skeptical
when
anybody
announces
that
he
teaches
any
particular
method
leschetizky
without
any
particular
method
is
a
great
force
by
virtue
of
his
tremendously
interesting
personality
and
his
great
qualities
as
an
artist
he
is
himself
a
source
of
inspiration
at
eighty
he
was
still
a
youth
full
of
vitality
and
enthusiasm
some
student
diffident
but
worthy
was
always
encouraged
another
was
incited
by
sarcasm
still
another
was
scolded
outright
practical
illustration
on
the
piano
showing
not
to
do
it
telling
of
pertinent
stories
to
elucidate
a
point
are
among
the
means
which
he
constantly
employed
to
bring
out
the
best
that
was
in
his
pupils
a
good
teacher
can
not
insure
success
and
leschetizky
has
naturally
had
many
pupils
who
will
never
become
great
virtuosos
it
was
never
in
the
pupils
and
no
matter
how
great
the
teacher
he
can
not
create
talent
that
does
not
exist
the
many
books
published
upon
the
leschetizky
system
by
his
assistants
have
merit
but
they
by
no
means
constitute
a
leschetizky
system
they
simply
give
some
very
rational
preparatory
exercise
that
the
assistants
give
in
preparing
pupils
for
the
master
leschetizky
himself
laughs
when
one
speaks
of
his
or
success
in
public
appearance
will
never
come
through
any
system
or
method
except
that
which
works
toward
the
end
of
making
a
mature
and
genuine
artist
programs
skill
in
the
arrangement
of
an
artist
programs
has
much
to
do
with
his
success
this
matter
has
two
distinct
aspects
firstly
the
program
must
attractive
and
secondly
it
must
well
in
the
rendition
when
i
say
the
program
must
look
attractive
i
mean
that
it
must
contain
works
which
interest
it
should
be
neither
entirely
conventional
nor
should
it
contain
novelties
exclusively
the
classics
should
be
represented
because
the
large
army
of
students
expect
to
be
especially
benefited
by
hearing
these
performed
by
a
great
artist
novelties
must
be
placed
on
the
program
to
make
it
attractive
to
the
maturer
habitués
of
the
concert
room
but
more
important
to
my
mind
is
the
other
aspect
of
program
making
which
i
have
mentioned
there
must
be
contrasts
in
the
character
and
tonal
nature
of
the
compositions
played
they
must
be
so
grouped
that
the
interest
of
the
hearers
will
be
not
only
sustained
to
the
end
but
will
gradually
increase
it
goes
without
saying
that
each
composition
should
have
merit
and
worth
as
musical
literature
but
beyond
that
there
should
be
variety
in
the
character
of
the
different
compositions
the
classic
the
romantic
and
the
modern
compositions
should
all
be
given
representation
to
play
several
slow
movements
or
several
vivacious
movements
in
succession
would
tend
to
tire
the
listener
should
be
avoided
it
may
truly
be
said
that
program
making
is
in
itself
a
high
art
it
is
difficult
to
give
advice
on
this
subject
by
any
general
statement
generalizations
are
too
often
misleading
i
would
advise
the
young
artist
to
study
carefully
the
programs
of
the
most
successful
artists
and
to
attempt
to
discover
the
principle
underlying
their
arrangement
one
thing
which
should
never
be
forgotten
is
that
the
object
of
a
concert
is
not
merely
to
show
off
the
skill
of
the
performer
but
to
instruct
entertain
and
elevate
the
audience
the
bulk
of
the
program
should
be
composed
of
standard
works
but
novelties
of
genuine
worth
should
be
given
a
place
on
the
program
personality
the
player
personality
is
of
inestimable
importance
in
winning
the
approval
of
the
public
i
do
not
refer
particularly
to
personal
beauty
although
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
a
pleasing
appearance
is
helpful
in
conquering
an
audience
what
i
mean
is
sincerity
individuality
temperament
what
we
vaguely
describe
as
magnetism
is
often
possessed
by
players
who
can
lay
no
particular
claim
to
personal
beauty
some
players
seem
fairly
to
hypnotize
their
audiences
yes
hypnotize
them
this
is
not
done
by
practicing
any
species
of
black
art
or
by
consciously
following
any
psychological
formula
but
by
the
sheer
intensity
of
feeling
of
the
artist
at
the
moment
of
performance
the
great
performer
in
such
moments
of
passion
forgets
himself
entirely
he
is
in
a
sort
of
artistic
trance
technical
mastery
of
the
composition
being
presupposed
the
artist
need
not
and
does
not
give
thought
to
the
matter
of
playing
the
notes
correctly
but
in
himself
what
he
feels
to
have
been
the
mood
of
the
composer
the
composition
itself
it
is
this
kind
of
playing
which
establishes
an
invisible
cord
connecting
the
player
and
the
hearts
and
swayed
himself
by
the
feelings
of
the
moment
he
sways
his
audience
he
makes
the
music
he
draws
from
the
instrument
supreme
in
every
soul
in
the
audience
his
feeling
and
passion
are
contagious
and
carry
the
audience
away
these
are
the
moments
not
only
of
the
greatest
triumph
but
of
the
greatest
exultation
for
the
artist
he
who
can
not
thus
sway
audiences
will
never
rise
above
mediocrity
do
not
attempt
the
impossible
to
those
who
are
still
in
the
preparatory
stage
of
development
i
am
glad
to
give
one
word
of
advice
not
play
pieces
that
are
away
beyond
your
this
is
the
greatest
fault
in
our
american
musical
educational
systems
of
pupils
are
permitted
to
play
works
that
are
technically
impossible
for
them
to
hope
to
execute
without
years
of
preparation
what
a
huge
blunder
this
is
the
pupil
comes
to
the
teacher
let
us
say
with
the
hungarian
of
liszt
it
takes
some
fortitude
for
the
conscientious
teacher
to
tell
the
pupil
that
she
should
work
with
the
major
of
haydn
instead
the
pupil
with
a
kind
of
confidence
that
is
to
say
the
least
dangerous
imagines
that
the
teacher
is
trying
to
keep
her
back
and
often
goes
to
another
teacher
who
will
gratify
her
whim
american
girls
think
that
they
can
do
everything
nothing
is
beyond
them
this
is
a
country
of
great
accomplishment
and
they
do
not
realize
that
in
music
is
long
the
virtuoso
comes
to
a
great
metropolis
and
plays
a
moszkowski
concerto
of
great
difficulty
the
next
day
the
music
stores
exhaust
their
stocks
of
this
work
and
a
dozen
misses
who
might
with
difficulty
play
a
mendelssohn
with
are
buried
in
the
avalanche
of
technical
impossibilities
that
the
alluring
concerto
provides
foreign
débuts
unfortunately
a
foreign
seems
to
be
necessary
for
the
artist
who
would
court
the
favor
of
the
american
public
foreign
pianists
get
engagements
long
before
their
managers
in
america
ever
hear
them
in
the
present
state
of
affairs
if
an
american
pianist
were
to
have
the
ability
of
three
liszts
and
three
rubinsteins
in
one
person
he
could
only
hope
for
meager
reward
if
he
did
not
have
a
great
european
reputation
behind
him
the
condition
is
absurd
and
regrettable
but
nevertheless
true
we
have
many
splendid
teachers
in
america
as
fine
as
there
are
in
the
world
we
have
in
our
larger
cities
musical
audiences
whose
judgment
is
as
discriminating
as
that
of
the
best
european
audiences
many
an
artist
with
a
great
european
reputation
has
come
to
this
country
and
failing
make
good
in
the
judgment
of
our
critics
and
audiences
went
back
with
his
reputation
seriously
impaired
nevertheless
as
i
have
stated
the
american
artist
without
a
european
reputation
has
no
drawing
power
and
therefore
does
not
interest
the
managers
and
the
piano
manufacturers
who
nowadays
have
largely
supplanted
the
managers
this
being
so
i
can
only
advise
the
american
artist
to
do
as
others
had
to
do
go
to
europe
give
a
few
concerts
in
berlin
london
vienna
or
paris
let
the
concert
director
who
arranges
your
concerts
paper
the
house
but
be
sure
you
get
a
few
critics
in
the
audience
have
your
criticisms
translated
and
get
them
republished
in
american
papers
then
if
you
have
real
merit
you
may
get
a
chance
the
interest
in
music
in
the
united
states
at
the
present
time
is
phenomenal
european
peoples
have
no
conception
of
it
nowhere
in
the
world
can
such
interest
be
found
audiences
in
different
parts
of
the
country
do
not
differ
very
greatly
from
the
standpoint
of
intelligent
appreciation
when
we
consider
the
great
uncultured
masses
of
peasants
in
europe
and
the
conditions
of
our
own
farmers
especially
in
the
west
there
is
no
basis
of
comparison
america
is
already
a
musical
country
a
very
musical
country
it
is
only
in
its
failure
to
properly
support
native
musicians
that
we
are
subject
to
criticism
practical
suggestions
to
the
young
man
or
woman
who
would
learn
secret
of
public
appearance
i
would
say
look
deeply
into
your
natural
qualifications
use
every
morsel
of
judgment
you
possess
to
endeavor
to
determine
whether
you
are
talented
or
simply
at
music
court
the
advice
of
unbiased
professional
musicians
and
meditate
upon
the
difficulties
leading
to
a
successful
career
and
do
not
decide
to
add
one
more
musician
to
the
world
until
you
are
confident
of
your
suitability
for
the
work
remember
that
this
moment
of
decision
is
a
very
important
time
and
that
you
may
be
upon
the
threshold
of
a
dangerous
mistake
remember
that
there
are
thousands
of
successful
and
happy
teachers
for
one
successful
virtuoso
after
you
have
determined
to
undertake
the
career
of
the
concert
performer
let
nothing
stand
in
the
way
of
study
except
the
consideration
of
your
health
success
with
a
body
and
a
shattered
mind
is
a
worthless
conquest
remember
that
if
you
wish
a
permanent
position
you
must
be
thoroughly
trained
in
all
branches
of
your
art
avoid
charlatanism
and
the
kind
of
advertisement
that
will
bring
you
notoriety
at
the
sacrifice
of
your
and
the
respect
of
your
best
friends
remember
that
real
worth
is
after
all
the
thing
that
brings
enduring
fame
study
the
public
seek
to
find
out
what
pleases
it
but
never
lower
the
standards
of
your
art
read
the
best
literature
study
pictures
travel
broaden
your
mind
acquire
general
culture
be
careful
of
your
stage
deportment
endeavor
to
do
nothing
at
the
keyboard
that
will
emphasize
any
personal
eccentricity
always
be
sincere
and
true
to
your
own
nature
but
within
these
limits
try
to
make
a
pleasing
impression
always
be
your
own
severest
critic
be
not
easily
satisfied
with
yourself
hitch
your
wagon
to
a
star
let
your
standard
of
perfection
be
the
very
highest
always
strive
to
reach
that
standard
never
play
in
public
a
piece
that
you
have
not
thoroughly
mastered
there
is
nothing
more
valuable
than
public
confidence
once
secured
it
is
the
greatest
asset
an
artist
can
possess
i
have
repeatedly
been
asked
to
give
ten
rules
for
practice
it
is
not
possible
to
formulate
ten
rules
that
could
be
applied
in
every
case
but
the
following
suggestions
will
be
found
valuable
to
many
students
concentrate
during
every
second
of
your
practice
to
concentrate
means
to
bring
all
your
thinking
powers
to
bear
upon
one
central
point
with
the
greatest
possible
intensity
without
such
concentration
nothing
can
be
accomplished
during
the
practice
period
one
hour
of
concentrated
thinking
is
worth
weeks
of
thoughtless
practice
it
is
safe
to
say
that
years
are
being
wasted
by
students
in
this
country
who
fail
to
get
the
most
out
of
their
practice
because
they
do
not
know
how
to
concentrate
a
famous
thinker
has
said
evidence
of
superior
genius
is
the
power
of
intellectual
concentration
divide
your
practice
time
into
periods
of
not
more
than
two
hours
you
will
find
it
impossible
to
concentrate
properly
if
you
attempt
to
practice
more
than
two
hours
at
a
time
do
not
have
an
arbitrary
program
of
practice
work
for
this
course
is
liable
to
make
your
work
monotonous
for
one
who
practices
four
hours
and
that
is
enough
for
almost
any
student
one
hour
for
purely
technical
work
one
hour
for
bach
and
two
hours
for
pieces
is
to
be
recommended
in
commencing
your
practice
play
over
your
piece
once
or
twice
before
beginning
to
memorize
then
after
working
through
the
entire
composition
pick
out
the
more
difficult
passages
for
special
attention
and
reiteration
always
practice
slowly
at
first
this
is
simply
another
way
of
telling
the
pupil
to
concentrate
even
after
you
have
played
your
piece
at
the
required
speed
and
with
reasonable
confidence
that
it
is
correct
never
fail
to
go
back
now
and
then
and
play
it
at
the
speed
at
which
you
learned
it
this
is
a
practice
which
many
virtuosos
follow
pieces
that
they
have
played
time
and
time
again
before
enthusiastic
audiences
are
by
playing
them
very
slowly
this
is
the
only
real
way
to
undo
mistakes
that
are
bound
to
creep
into
one
performance
when
pieces
are
constantly
played
in
a
rapid
tempo
do
not
attempt
to
practice
your
whole
piece
at
first
take
a
small
section
or
even
a
phrase
if
you
take
a
longer
section
than
say
sixteen
bars
you
will
find
it
difficult
to
avoid
mistakes
of
course
when
the
piece
is
mastered
you
should
have
all
these
sections
so
unified
that
you
can
play
the
entire
composition
smoothly
and
without
a
break
first
memorize
the
section
you
have
selected
for
study
and
then
practice
it
if
you
do
not
know
it
well
enough
to
practice
it
from
memory
you
have
not
grasped
its
musical
content
but
are
playing
mechanically
occasionally
memorize
backwards
that
is
take
the
last
few
measures
and
learn
them
thoroughly
then
take
the
preceding
measures
and
continue
in
this
way
until
the
whole
is
mastered
even
after
you
have
played
the
piece
many
times
this
process
often
compels
a
concentration
that
is
beneficial
when
studying
remember
that
practice
is
simply
a
means
of
cultivating
habits
if
you
play
correctly
from
the
start
you
will
form
good
habits
if
you
play
carelessly
and
faultily
your
playing
will
grow
continually
worse
consequently
play
so
slowly
and
correctly
from
the
start
that
you
may
insure
the
right
fingering
phrasing
tone
touch
staccato
legato
portamento
etc
pedaling
and
dynamic
effects
if
you
postpone
the
attainment
of
any
of
these
qualities
to
a
later
date
they
are
much
more
difficult
to
acquire
always

while
you
are

music
is

to
be

if
you
do
not
listen
to
your
own
playing

is
very
probable
that
other
people
will
not
care
to
listen
to
it
either
never
attempt
to
play
anything
in
public
that
you
have
just
finished
studying
when
you
are
through
working
upon
a
piece
put
it
away
to
be
musically
digested
then
after
some
time
repeat
the
same
process
and
again

third
time

his
first
teachers
were

the
significance
of
the

some
years
ago
i
met
a
very
famous
artist
whose
celebrity
rested
upon
the
wonderful
colored
glass
windows
that
he
had
produced
he
was
considered
by
most
of
his
contemporaries
the
greatest
of
all
makers
of
windows
his
fame
had
extended
throughout
the
artistic
circles
of
all
europe
a
little
remark
he
made
to
me
illustrates
the
importance
of
detail
better
than
anything
of
which
i
can
think
at
present
he
said
a
truly
great
work
of
art
in
the
form
of
a
stained
glass
window
should
be
accidentally
shattered
to
little
bits
one
should
be
able
to
estimate
the
greatness
of
the
whole
window
by
examining
one
of
the
fragments
even
though
all
the
other

were
missing

i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
if
one
were
in
another
room
that
one
could
invariably
tell
the
ability
of
an
artist
by
hearing
him
strike
one
note
but
if
the
note
is
heard
in
relation
to
the
other
notes
in
a
composition
its
proportionate
value
should
be
so
delicately
and
artistically
estimated
by
the
highly
trained
performer
that
it
forms
part
of
the
artistic
whole
for
instance
it
is
quite
easy
to
conceive
of
compositions
demanding
a
very
smooth
running
performance
in
which
one
jarring
or
harsh
note
indicating
faulty
artistic
calculation
upon
the
part
of
the
player
would
ruin
the
entire
interpretation
as
examples
of
this
one
might
cite
the
bach
freut
of
which
i
have
made
an
arrangement
and
such
a
composition
as
the
chopin
prelude
opus
no
with
its
running
accompaniment
in
the
left
hand
it
is
often
perfection
in
little
things
which
distinguishes
the
performance
of
the
great
pianist
from
that
of
the
novice
the
novice
usually
manages
to
get
the
main
points
but
he
does
not
work
for
the
little
niceties
of
interpretation
which
are
almost
invariably
the
defining
characteristic
of
the
interpretations
of
the
real
artist
that
is
the
performer
who
has
formed
the
habit
of
stopping
at
nothing
short
of
his
highest
ideal
of
perfection
learning
to
listen
there
is
a
detail
which
few
students
observe
which
is
of
such
vast
importance
that
one
is
tempted
to
say
that
the
main
part
of
successful
musical
progress
depends
upon
it
this
is
the
detail
of
learning
to
listen
every
sound
that
is
produced
during
the
practice
period
should
be
heard
that
is
it
should
be
heard
with
ears
open
to
give
that
sound
the
intelligent
analysis
which
it
deserves
anyone
who
has
observed
closely
and
taught
extensively
must
have
noticed
that
hours
and
hours
are
wasted
by
students
strumming
away
on
keyboards
and
giving
no
more
attention
to
the
sounds
they
produce
than
would
the
inmates
of
a
deaf
and
dumb
asylum
these
students
all
expect
to
become
fine
performers
even
though
they
may
not
aim
to
become
virtuosos
to
them
the
piano
keyboard
is
a
kind
of
gymnasium
attached
to
a
musical
instrument
they
may
of
course
acquire
strong
fingers
but
they
will
have
to
learn
to
listen
before
they
can
hope
to
become
even
passable
performers
at
my
own
recitals
no
one
in
the
audience
listens
more
attentively
than
i
do
i
strive
to
hear
every
note
and
while
i
am
playing
my
attention
is
so
concentrated
upon
the
one
purpose
of
delivering
the
work
in
the
most
artistic
manner
dictated
by
the
composer
demands
and
my
conception
of
the
piece
that
i
am
little
conscious
of
anything
else
i
have
also
learned
that
i
must
continually
have
my
mind
alert
to
opportunities
for
improvement
i
am
always
in
quest
of
new
beauties
and
even
while
playing
in
public
it
is
possible
to
conceive
of
new
details
that
come
like
revelations
the
artist
who
has
reached
the
period
when
he
fails
to
be
on
the
outlook
for
details
of
this
kind
and
is
convinced
that
in
no
possible
way
could
his
performances
be
improved
has
reached
a
very
dangerous
stage
of
artistic
stagnation
which
will
result
in
the
ruin
of
his
career
there
is
always
room
for
improvement
that
is
the
development
of
new
details
and
it
is
this
which
gives
zest
and
intellectual
interest
to
the
work
of
the
artist
without
it
his
public
efforts
would
become
very
tame
and
unattractive
self
development
in
my
own
development
as
an
artist
it
has
been
made
evident
to
me
time
and
time
again
that
success
comes
from
the
careful
observance
of
details
all
students
should
strive
to
estimate
their
own
artistic
ability
very
accurately
a
wrong
estimate
always
leads
to
a
dangerous
condition
if
i
had
failed
to
attend
to
certain
details
many
years
ago
i
would
have
stopped
very
far
short
of
anything
like
success
i
remember
that
when
i
concluded
my
term
as
professor
of
piano
at
the
new
england
conservatory
of
music
i
was
very
conscious
of
certain
deficiencies
in
my
style
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
had
been
accepted
as
a
virtuoso
in
europe
and
in
america
and
had
toured
with
great
orchestras
such
as
the
boston
symphony
orchestra
i
knew
better
than
anyone
else
that
there
were
certain
details
in
my
playing
that
i
could
not
afford
to
neglect
for
instance
i
knew
that
my
method
of
playing
the
trill
could
be
greatly
improved
and
i
also
knew
that
i
lacked
force
and
endurance
in
certain
passages
fortunately
although
a
comparatively
young
man
i
was
not
deceived
by
the
flattery
of
but
incapable
critics
who
were
quite
willing
to
convince
me
that
my
playing
was
as
perfect
as
it
was
possible
to
make
it
every
seeker
of
artistic
truth
is
more
widely
awake
to
his
own
deficiencies
than
any
of
his
critics
could
possibly
be
in
order
to
rectify
the
details
i
have
mentioned
as
well
as
some
i
have
not
mentioned
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
i
must
devise
an
entirely
new
technical
system
technical
systems
are
best
when
they
are
individual
speaking
theoretically
every
individual
needs
a
different
technical
system
every
hand
every
arm
every
set
of
ten
fingers
every
body
and
what
is
of
greatest
importance
every
intellect
is
different
from
every
other
i
consequently
endeavored
to
get
down
to
the
basic
laws
underlying
the
subject
of
technic
and
make
a
system
of
my
own
after
much
study
i
discovered
what
i
believed
to
be
the
technical
cause
of
my
defects
and
then
i
returned
to
europe
and
for
two
years
i
devoted
myself
almost
exclusively
to
technical
study
along
the
individual
lines
i
had
devised
to
my
great
delight
details
that
had
always
defied
me
the
rebellious
trills
the
faltering
bravura
passages
the
uneven
runs
all
came
into
beautiful
submission
and
with
them
came
a
new
delight
in
playing
finding
individual
faults
i
trust
that
my
experience
will
set
some
ambitious
piano
students
to
thinking
and
that
they
may
be
benefited
by
it
there
is
always
a
way
of
correcting
deficiencies
if
the
way
can
only
be
found
the
first
thing
however
is
to
recognize
the
detail
itself
and
then
to
realize
that
instead
of
being
a
detail
it
is
a
matter
of
vast
importance
until
it
has
been
conquered
and
brought
into
submission
in
playing
always
note
where
your
difficulties
seem
to
lie
then
when
advisable
isolate
those
difficulties
and
practice
them
separately
this
is
the
manner
in
which
all
good
technical
exercises
are
devised
your
own
difficulty
is
the
difficulty
which
you
should
practice
most
why
waste
time
in
practicing
passages
which
you
can
play
perfectly
well
one
player
may
have
difficulty
in
playing
trills
while
to
another
player
of
equal
general
musical
ability
trills
may
be
perfectly
easy
in
playing
arpeggios
however
the
difficulties
which
prove
obstacles
to
the
players
may
be
entirely
reversed
the
one
who
could
play
the
trill
perfectly
might
not
be
able
under
any
circumstance
to
play
an
arpeggio
with
the
requisite
smoothness
and
true
legato
demanded
while
the
student
who
found
the
trill
impossible
possesses
the
ability
to
run
arpeggios
and
cadenzas
with
the
fluency
of
a
forest
rivulet
all
technical
exercises
must
be
given
to
the
pupil
with
great
discretion
and
judgment
just
as
poisonous
medicines
must
be
administered
to
the
patient
with
great
care
the
indiscriminate
giving
of
technical
exercises
may
impede
progress
rather
than
advance
the
pupil
simply
because
an
exercise
happens
to
come
in
a
certain
position
in
a
book
of
technical
exercises
is
no
reason
why
the
particular
pupil
being
taught
needs
that
exercise
at
that
particular
time
some
exercises
which
are
not
feasible
and
others
which
are
inexpedient
at
a
certain
time
may
prove
invaluable
later
in
the
pupil
progress
take
the
famous
tausig
exercises
for
instance
tausig
was
a
master
of
technic
who
had
few
if
any
equals
in
his
time
his
exercises
are
for
the
most
part
very
ingenious
and
useful
to
advanced
players
but
when
some
of
them
are
transposed
into
other
keys
as
their
composer
demands
they
become
practically
impossible
to
play
with
the
proper
touch
etc
furthermore
one
would
be
very
unlikely
to
find
a
passage
demanding
such
a
technical
feat
in
the
compositions
of
any
of
the
great
masters
of
the
piano
consequently
such
exercises
are
of
no
practical
value
and
would
only
be
demanded
by
a
teacher
with
more
respect
for
tradition
than
common
sense
details
of
phrasing
and
accentuation
some
students
look
upon
phrasing
as
a
detail
that
can
be
postponed
until
other
supposedly
more
important
things
are
accomplished
the
very
musical
meaning
of
any
composition
depends
upon
the
correct
understanding
and
delivery
of
the
phrases
which
make
that
composition
to
neglect
the
phrases
would
be
about
as
sensible
as
it
would
be
for
the
great
actor
to
neglect
the
proper
thought
division
in
the
interpretation
of
his
lines
the
greatest
masterpiece
of
dramatic
literature
whether
it
be
and
malade
or
becomes
nonsense
if
the
thought
divisions
indicated
by
the
verbal
phrases
are
not
carefully
determined
and
expressed
great
actors
spend
hours
and
hours
seeking
for
the
best
method
of
expressing
the
author
meaning
no
pianist
of
ability
would
think
of
giving
less
careful
attention
to
phrasing
how
stupid
it
would
be
for
the
actor
to
add
a
word
that
concluded
one
sentence
to
the
beginning
of
the
next
sentence
how
erroneous
then
is
it
for
the
pupil
to
add
the
last
note
of
one
phrase
to
the
beginning
of
the
next
phrase
phrasing
is
anything
but
a
detail
fine
phrasing
depends
first
upon
a
knowledge
of
music
which
enables
one
to
define
the
limitations
of
the
phrase
and
then
upon
a
knowledge
of
pianoforte
playing
which
enables
one
to
execute
it
properly
phrasing
is
closely
allied
to
the
subject
of
accentuation
and
both
subjects
are
intimately
connected
with
that
of
fingering
without
the
proper
fingers
it
is
often
impossible
to
execute
certain
phrases
correctly
generally
the
accents
are
considered
of
importance
because
they
are
supposed
to
fall
in
certain
set
parts
of
given
measures
thus
indicating
the
meter
in
instructing
very
young
pupils
it
may
be
necessary
to
lead
them
to
believe
that
the
time
must
be
marked
in
a
definite
manner
by
such
accents
but
as
the
pupil
advances
he
must
understand
that
the
measure
divisions
are
inserted
principally
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
him
to
read
easily
he
should
learn
to
look
upon
each
piece
of
music
as
a
beautiful
tapestry
in
which
the
main
consideration
is
the
principal
design
of
the
work
as
a
whole
and
not
the
invisible
marking
threads
which
the
manufacturer
is
obliged
to
put
in
the
loom
in
order
to
have
a
structure
upon
which
the
tapestry
may
be
woven
bach
bach
bach
in
the
study
of
the
subject
of
accentuation
and
phrasing
it
would
not
be
possible
for
anyone
to
recommend
anything
more
instructive
than
the
works
of
johann
sebastian
bach
the
immortal
thüringian
composer
was
the
of
all
his
tapestries
have
never
been
equalled
in
refinement
color
breadth
and
general
beauty
why
is
bach
so
valuable
for
the
student
this
is
an
easy
question
to
answer
it
is
because
his
works
are
so
constructed
that
they
compel
one
to
study
these
details
even
if
the
student
has
only
mastered
the
intricacies
of
the
voice
it
is
safe
to
say
that
he
has
become
a
better
player
more
than
this
bach
forces
the
student
to
think
if
the
student
has
never
thought
before
during
his
practice
periods
he
will
soon
find
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
him
to
encompass
the
difficulties
of
bach
without
the
closest
mental
application
in
fact
he
may
also
discover
that
it
is
possible
for
him
to
work
out
some
of
his
musical
problems
while
away
from
the
keyboard
many
of
the
most
perplexing
musical
questions
and
difficulties
that
have
ever
confronted
me
have
been
solved
mentally
while
i
have
been
walking
upon
the
street
or
lying
in

at
night
sometimes
the
solution
of
difficult
details
comes
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
i
remember
that
when
i
was
a
very
young
man
i
was
engaged
to
play
a
concerto
with
a
large
symphony
orchestra
one
part
of
the
concerto
had
always
troubled
me
and
i
was
somewhat
apprehensive
about
it
during
one
of
the
pauses
while
the
orchestra
was
playing
the
correct
interpretation
came
to
me
like
a
flash
i
waited
until
the
orchestra
was
playing
very
loud
and
made
an
opportunity
to
run
over
the
difficult
passage
of
course
my
playing
could
not
be
heard
under
the
of
the
orchestra
and
when
the
time
came
for
the
proper
delivery
of
the
passage
it
was
vastly
better
than
it
would
have
been
otherwise
i
never
neglect
an
opportunity
to
improve
no
matter
how
perfect
a
previous
interpretation
may
have
seemed
to
me
in
fact
i
often
go
directly
home
from
the
concert
and
practice
for
hours
upon
the
very
pieces
that
i
have
been
playing
because
during
the
concert
certain
new
ideas
have
come
to
me
these
ideas
are
very
precious
and
to
neglect
them
or
to
consider
them
details
to
be
postponed
for
future
development
would
be
ridiculous

the
extreme
questions

what

does

do
imitate
anyone
keep
yourself
true
to
yourself
cultivate
your
individuality
and
do
not
follow
blindly
in
the
paths
of
others
in
this
one
thought
liszt
embodied
a
kind
of
a
pedagogical
sermon
which
should
be
preached
every
day
in
all
the
schools
conservatories
and
music
studios
of
the
world
nothing
is
so
pitiful
as
the
evidences
of
a
strong
individuality
crushed
out
by
an
artificial
educational
system
which
makes
the
system
itself
of
paramount
importance
and
the
individual
of
microbic
significance
the
signs
of
individuality
may
be
observed
in
little
folks
at
a
very
early
age
with
some
children
they
are
not
very
pronounced
and
the
child
seems
like
hundreds
of
others
without
any
particular
inclination
artistic
or
otherwise
it
is
then
that
the
teacher
powers
of
divination
should
be
brought
into
play
before
any
real
progress
can
be
made
the
nature
of
the
child
must
be
studied
carefully
in
the
case
of
other
children
the
individuality
is
very
marked
at
an
early
age
as
a
rule
the
child
with
the
marked
individuality
is
the
one
from
whom
the
most
may
be
expected
later
in
life
sometimes
this
very
individuality
is
mistaken
for
precocity
this
is
particularly
the
case
with
musicians
in
a
few
instances
the
individuality
of
the
master
has
been
developed
late
in
life
as
was
the
case
of
richard
wagner
whose
early
individual
tendencies
were
toward
the
drama
rather
than
music
new
problems
at
every
step
the
teacher
in
accepting
a
new
pupil
should
realize
that
there
at
once
arises
new
problems
at
every
step
the
pupil
hand
mind
body
and
soul
may
be
in
reality
different
from
those
of
every
other
pupil
the
teacher
has
taught
the
individual
peculiarities
of
the
hand
should
be
carefully
considered
if
the
hand
has
long
tapering
fingers
with
the
fingers
widely
separated
it
will
need
quite
different
treatment
from
that
of
the
pupil
with
a
short
compact
muscular
hand
if
the
pupil
mind
indicates
mental
lethargy
or
a
lack
of
the
proper
early
educational
training
this
must
be
carefully
considered
by
the
teacher
if
the
pupil
body
is
frail
and
the
health
uncertain
surely
the
teacher
will
not
think
of
prescribing
the
same
work
she
would
prescribe
for
a
robust
energetic
pupil
who
appears
never
to
have
had
a
sick
day
one
pupil
might
be
able
to
practice
comfortably
for
four
and
five
hours
a
day
while
another
would
find
her
energy
and
interest
exhausted
in
two
hours
in
fact
i
would
consider
the
study
of
individuality
the
principal
care
or
study
of
the
teacher
the
individuality
of
different
virtuoso
performers
is
very
marked
although
the
virtuoso
aspires
to
encompass
all
styles
that
is
to
be
what
you
would
call
an
player
it
is
nevertheless
the
individuality
of
the
player
that
adds
the
additional
charm
to
the
you
hear
a
great
masterpiece
executed
by
one
virtuoso
and
when
you
hear
the
same
composition
played
by
another
you
will
detect
a
difference
not
of
technical
ability
or
of
artistic
comprehension
but
rather
of
individuality
rembrandt
rubens
and
vandyke
might
have
all
painted
from
the
same
model
but
the
finished
portrait
would
have
been
different
and
that
difference
would
have
been
a
reflection
of
the
individuality
of
the
artist
the
teacher
responsibility
again
let
me
emphasize
the
necessity
for
the
correct
diagnosis
of
the
pupil
individuality
upon
the
part
of
the
teacher
unless
the
right
work
is
prescribed
by
the
teacher
the
pupil
will
rarely
ever
survive
artistically
it
is
much
the
same
as
with
the
doctor
if
the
doctor
gives
the
wrong
medicine
and
the
patient
dies
surely
the
doctor
is
to
blame
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
doctor
had
good
intentions
or
not
the
patient
is
dead
and
that
is
the
end
of
all
i
have
little
patience
with
these
people
who
have
such
wonderful
intentions
but
who
have
neither
the
ability
courage
nor
willingness
to
carry
out
these
intentions
many
teachers
would
like
to
accomplish
a
very
great
deal
for
their
pupils
but
alas
they
are
either
not
able
or
they
neglect
those
very
things
which
make
the
teacher
work
a
mission
one
of
the
teacher
greatest
responsibilities
lies
in
determining
at
first
upon
a
rational
educational
course
by
divining
the
pupil
individuality
remember
that
pupils
are
not
all
like
sheep
to
be
shorn
in
the
same
identical
fashion
with
the
same
identical
shears
edward
macdowell
individuality
one
of
the
most
remarkable
cases
of
a
pronounced
musical
individuality
was
that
of
the
late
edward
macdowell
who
came
to
me
for
instruction
for
a
considerable
time
he
was
then
quite
youthful
and
his
motives
from
the
very
first
were
of
the
highest
and
noblest
his
ideals
were
so
lofty
that
he
required
little
stimulation
or
urging
of
any
kind
here
it
was
necessary
to
study
the
pupil
nature
very
carefully
and
provide
work
that
would
develop
his
keenly
artistic
individuality
i
remember
that
he
was
extremely
fond
of
grieg
and
the
marked
and
original
character
of
the
norwegian
made
a
deep
impression
upon
him
he
was
poetical
and
loved
to
study
and
read
poetry
to
have
repressed
macdowell
in
a
harsh
or
didactic
manner
would
have
been
to
have
demolished
those
very
characteristics
which
in
later
years
developed
in
such
astonishing
fashion
that
his
compositions
have
a
distinctiveness
and
a
style
all
their
own
it
gives
me
great
pleasure
to
place
his
compositions
upon
my
programs
abroad
and
i
find
that
they
are
keenly
appreciated
by
music
lovers
in
the
old
world
if
macdowell
had
not
had
a
strong
individuality
and
if
he
had
not
permitted
this
individuality
to
be
developed
along
normal
lines
his
compositions
would
not
be
the
treasures
to
our
art
that
they
are
developing
individuality
through
poetry
if
the
teacher
discovers
a
pupil
with
apparent
musical
talent
but
whose
nature
has
not
been
developed
to
appreciate
the
beautiful
and
romantic
in
this
wonderful
world
of
ours
he
will
find
it
quite
impossible
to
alter
the
pupil
individuality
in
this
respect
by
work
at
the
keyboard
alone
the
mundane
prosaic
individual
who
believes
that
the
sole
aim
of
musical
study
is
the
acquisition
of
technic
or
the
magic
of
digital
speed
must
be
brought
to
realize
that
this
is
a
fault
of
individuality
which
will
mar
his
entire
career
unless
it
is
intelligently
corrected
years
and
years
spent
in
practice
will
not
make
either
a
musician
or
a
virtuoso
out
of
one
who
can
conceive
of
nothing
more
than
how
many
times
he
can
play
a
series
of
notes
within
the
beats
of
the
metronome
beating
times
a
minute
speed
does
not
constitute
virtuosity
nor
does
the
ability
to
unravel
the
somewhat
intricate
keyboard
puzzles
of
bach
and
brahms
make
in
itself
fine
piano
playing
the
mind
of
the
artist
must
be
cultured
in
fact
quite
as
cultured
as
that
of
the
composer
who
conceived
the
music
culture
comes
from
the
observation
of
many
things
nature
architecture
science
machinery
sculpture
history
men
and
women
and
poetry
i
advise
aspiring
music
students
to
read
a
great
deal
of
poetry
i
find
great
inspiration
in
shakespeare
inspiration
which
i
know
is
communicated
to
my
interpretations
of
musical
masterpieces
at
my
concerts
who
can
remain
unmoved
by
the
mystery
and
psychology
of
the
keen
suffering
and
misery
of
the
bitter
hate
and
revenge
of
the
sweet
devotion
of
and
the
majesty
of
and
the
fairy
beauty
of
midsummer
in
this
wonderful
kaleidoscope
of
all
the
human
passions
one
can
find
a
world
of
inspiration
i
am
also
intensely
fond
of
goethe
heine
and
alfred
de
musset
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
compare
them
to
the
great
masters
of
music
shakespeare
i
compare
to
brahms
goethe
to
bach
and
beethoven
and
heine
and
musset
to
chopin
and
liszt
cultivating
vivacity
and
brilliancy
vivacity
and
brilliancy
in
playing
are
largely
matters
of
temperament
and
a
fluent
technic
i
owe
a
great
deal
in
this
respect
to
gottschalk
when
he
came
back
to
america
fresh
from
the
hands
of
the
inimitable
chopin
he
took
the
most
minute
pains
to
cultivate
this
characteristic
in
my
playing
chopin
own
playing
was
marked
by
delicacy
and
an
intensity
that
was
apart
from
the
bravura
playing
of
most
of
the
artists
of
his
time
gottschalk
was
a
keen
observer
and
he
did
everything
possible
to
impart
this
style
to
me
i
have
used
the
studies
of
czerny
liszt
henselt
and
clementi
to
develop
brilliancy
with
pupils
it
should
be
remembered
that
the
root
of
all
brilliant
playing
lies
in
one
thing
accuracy
without
accuracy
any
attempt
at
brilliancy
must
result
in
mussiness
it
is
impossible
to
explain
these
things
by
means
of
books
and
theories
remember
what
goethe
says
alle
theorie
is
grau
mein
freund
all
theory
is
foggy
or
hard
to
comprehend
one
can
say
fifty
times
as
much
in
twenty
minutes
as
one
can
put
in
a
book
books
are
necessary
but
by
no
means
depend
entirely
upon
books
for
technical
instruction
individuals
who
are
careless
possess
a
trait
that
will
seriously
mar
their
individuality
as
musicians
and
artists
carelessness
is
so
often
taken
for
abandon
in
playing
abandon
is
something
quite
different
and
pertains
to
that
unconsciousness
of
technical
effort
which
only
comes
to
the
artist
after
years
of
practice
to
play
with
abandon
and
miss
a
few
notes
in
this
run
play
a
few
false
notes
in
the
next
strike
the
wrong
bass
note
here
and
there
mumble
trills
and
overlook
the
correct
phrasing
entirely
with
the
idea
that
you
are
doing
the
same
thing
you
have
seen
some
great
virtuoso
do
is
simply
the
superlative
degree
of
carelessness
to
one
whose
individuality
is
marred
by
carelessness
let
me
recommend
very
slow
playing
with
the
most
minute
attention
to
detail
technically
speaking
czerny
and
bach
are
of
great
value
in
correcting
carelessness
in
czerny
the
musical
structure
of
the
compositions
is
so
clearly
and
openly
outlined
that
any
error
is
easily
detected
while
in
bach
the
structure
is
so
close
and
compact
that
it
is
difficult
to
make
an
error
without
interrupting
the
movement
of
some
other
voice
that
will
reveal
the
error
the
main
consideration
however
is
personal
carefulness
and
it
makes
little
difference
what
the
study
is
so
long
as
the
student
himself
takes
great
pains
to
see
that
he
is
right
and
exactly
right
before
he
attempts
to
go
ahead
most
musicians
however
would
say
that
bach
was
the
one
great
stone
upon
which
our
higher
technical
structure
must
firmly
stand
some
individuals
are
so
superficial
and
so
frothy
that
it
is
difficult
to
conceive
of
their
doing
anything
serious
or
really
worth
while
it
is
very
hard
for
the
teacher
to
work
with
such
a
pupil
because
they
have
not
realized
themselves
as
yet
they
have
not
looked
into
their
lives
and
discerned
those
things
which
make
life
of
most
importance
life
is
not
all
play
nor
is
it
all
sorrow
but
sorrow
often
does
much
to
develop
the
musician
character
to
make
him
look
into
himself
and
discover
his
more
serious
purposes
this
might
also
be
accomplished
by
some
such
means
of
as
christian
science
although
i
am
not
a
christian
scientist
i
am
a
great
believer
in
its
wonderful
principles
the
greatest
care
must
be
taken
in
developing
the
individualities
of
the
superficial
pupils
to
give
them
bach
or
brahms
at
the
outstart
would
be
to
irritate
them
they
must
be
led
to
a
fondness
for
music
of
a
deeper
or
more
worthy
character
by
gradual
steps
in
that
direction
in
my
own
case
i
was
fortunate
in
having
the
advice
of
mature
and
famous
musicians
and
as
a
child
was
given
music
of
a
serious
order
only
i
have
always
been
grateful
for
this
experience
at
one
of
my
first
new
york
concerts
i
had
the
honor
of
having
theodore
thomas
as
first
violinist
and
i
well
remember
his
natural
bent
for
music
of
a
serious
order
which
was
in
a
decided
contrast
to
the
popular
musical
taste
of
the
times
the
importance
of
studying
musical
history
every
composer
has
a
pronounced
individuality
to
the
experienced
musician
this
individuality
becomes
so
marked
that
he
can
often
detect
the
composer
style
in
a
composition
which
he
has
never
heard
the
artist
studies
the
individuality
of
the
composer
through
the
study
of
his
biography
through
the
study
of
musical
history
in
general
and
through
the
analysis
of
individual
compositions
every
music
student
should
be
familiar
with
the
intensely
necessary
and
extremely
valuable
subject
of
musical
history
how
else
can
he
become
familiar
with
the
personal
individualities
of
the
great
composers
the
more
i
know
of
chopin
beethoven
scarlatti
or
mendelssohn
as
men
and
the
more
i
know
of
the
times
in
which
they
lived
the
closer
i
feel
to
the
manner
in
which
they
would
have
wished
their
compositions
interpreted
consider
how
markedly
different
are
the
individualities
of
wagner
and
haydn
and
how
different
the
interpretations
of
the
works
of
these
masters
should
be
strauss
and
debussy
are
also
very
different
in
their
methods
of
composition
strauss
seems
to
me
a
tremendous
genius
who
is
inventing
a
new
musical
language
as
he
goes
debussy
does
not
appeal
to
me
in
the
same
manner
he
always
seems
to
be
groping
for
musical
ideas
while
with
strauss
the
greatness
of
his
ideas
is
always
evident
and
in
closing
let
me
say
that
and
are
the
moulders
of
all
individuality
few
of
us
close
our
days
with
the
same
individualities
which
become
evident
in
our
youth
we
are
either
growing
better
or
worse
all
the
time
we
rarely
stand
still
to
the
musician
work
is
the
great
sculptor
of
individuality
as
you
work
and
as
you
think
so
will
you
be
no
deed
no
thought
no
hope
is
too
insignificant
to
fail
to
influence
your
nature
as
through
work
we
become
better
men
and
women
so
through
work
do
we
become
better
musicians
carlyle
has
beautifully
expressed
this
thought
in
past
and

thus
the

gospel
in

thy

forearm
and
back
permit
the
key
to
be
struck
upon
these
two
means
of
administering
force
must
depend
whatever
differentiation
in
dynamic
power
and
tonal
quality
the
player
desires
to
produce
the
various
gradations
of
tone
which
the
virtuoso
hand
and
arm
are
trained
to
execute
are
so
minute
that
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
conceive
of
a
scientific
instrument
or
scale
to
measure
them
physiologists
have
attempted
to
construct
instruments
to
do
this
but
little
of
value
has
come
from
such
experiments
a
rigid
arm
undesirable
only
a
comparatively
few
years
ago
thousands
of
teachers
were
insisting
upon
having
their
pupils
keep
the
arms
in
a
still
even
rigid
condition
during
practice
this
naturally
resulted
in
the
stiffest
imaginable
kind
of
a
touch
and
likewise
in
a
mechanical
style
of
playing
that
made
what
has
come
to
be
known
in
later
days
as
color
impossible
at
this
day
the
finger
touch
as
it
was
formerly
known
has
almost
gone
out
of
existence
by
finger
touch
i
refer
to
the
old
custom
of
holding
the
hand
and
forearm
almost
rigid
and
depending
upon
the
muscular
strength
of
the
fingers
for
all
tonal
effects
in
fact
i
so
rarely
employ
the
finger
touch
except
in
combination
with
the
arm
touch
that
it
is
almost
an
insignificant
factor
as
far
as
my
own
playing
is
concerned
by
this
the
reader
must
not
think
that
the
training
of
the
fingers
and
particularly
the
finger
tips
is
to
be
neglected
but
this
training
to
my
mind
is
not
so
much
a
matter
of
acquiring
digital
strength
to
produce
force
as
to
accustom
the
fingers
to
strike
the
notes
with
the
greatest
possible
accuracy
and
speed
this
belongs
rather
to
the
realm
of
technic
than
to
that
of
touch
and
behind
all
technic
is
the
intellect
of
the
player
technic
is
a
matter
of
training
the
finger
tips
to
attack
and
leave
the
keys
under
the
absolute
discipline
of
the
brain
touch
has
a
much
broader
and
wider
significance
it
is
touch
that
reveals
the
soul
of
the
player
touch
a
distinguishing
characteristic
touch
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
which
makes
one
music
sound
different
from
that
of
another
for
it
is
touch
that
dominates
the
player
means
of
producing
dynamic
shading
or
tone
quality
i
know
that
many
authorities
contend
that
the
quality
of
tone
depends
upon
the
instrument
rather
than
upon
the
performer
nevertheless
i
am
reasonably
confident
that
if
i
were
to
hear
a
number
of
pianists
play
in
succession
upon
the
same
instrument
behind
a
screen
and
one
of
these
performers
were
to
be
my
friend
harold
bauer
i
could
at
once
identify
his
playing
by
his
peculiarly
individual
touch
in
fact
the
trained
ear
can
identify
different
individual
characteristics
with
almost
the
same
accuracy
that
we
identify
different
voices
one
could
never
forget
leschetizky
touch
or
that
of
many
another
contemporary
pianist
no
matter
how
wonderful
the
pianist
technic
that
is
how
rapidly
and
accurately
he
can
play
passages
of
extraordinary
difficulty
it
is
quite
worthless
unless
he
possesses
that
control
over
his
touch
which
enables
him
to
interpret
the
composer
work
with
the
right
artistic
shading
a
fine
technic
without
the
requisite
touch
to
liberate
the
artistic
intelligence
and
is
like
a
gorgeous
chandelier
without
the
lights
until
the
lights
are
ignited
all
its
beauty
is
obscured
in
darkness
with
an
excellent
technic
and
a
fine
touch
together
with
a
broad
musical
and
general
education
and
artistic
temperament
the
young
player
may
be
said
to
be
equipped
to
enter
the
virtuoso
field
combining
different
touches
as
i
have
intimated
if
the
fingers
are
used
exclusively
a
terribly
dry
tone
must
result
the
touch
in
which
i
experience
a
complete
relaxation
of
the
arm
from
the
shoulder
to
the
finger
tips
is
the
condition
i
employ
at
most
times
but
the
touches
i
use
are
combinations
of
the
different
finger
hand
and
arm
touches
these
lead
to
myriads
of
results
and
only
the
experienced
performer
can
judge
where
they
should
be
applied
to
produce
desired
effects
you
will
observe
by
placing
your
hand
upon
my
shoulder
that
even
with
the
movement
of
the
single
finger
a
muscular
activity
may
be
detected
at
the
shoulder
this
shows
how
completely
relaxed
i
keep
my
entire
arm
during
performance
it
is
only
in
this
way
that
i
can
produce
the
right
kind
of
singing
tone
in
cantabile
passages
sometimes
i
use
one
touch
in
one
voice
and
an
entirely
different
touch
in
another
voice
the
combinations
are
kaleidoscopic
in
their
multiplicity
mechanical
methods
dangerous
i
have
never
been
in
favor
of
the
many
automatic
and
mechanical
methods
of
producing
touch
they
are
all
dangerous
to
my
mind
there
is
only
one
real
way
of
teaching
and
that
is
through
the
sense
of
hearing
of
the
pupil
the
teacher
should
go
to
the
piano
and
produce
the
desired
tonal
effect
and
the
pupil
should
listen
and
watch
the
teacher
then
the
pupil
should
be
instructed
to
secure
a
similar
result
and
the
teacher
should
persevere
until
the
audible
effect
is
nearly
the
same
if
the
pupil
working
empirically
does
not
discover
the
means
leading
to
this
effect
the
teacher
should
call
the
pupil
attention
to
some
of
the
physical
conditions
leading
to
the
result
if
the
teacher
is
unable
to
play
well
enough
to
illustrate
this
and
to
secure
the
right
kind
of
touch
from
his
pupils
he
has
no
business
to
be
a
teacher
of
advanced
students
all
the
theory
in
the
world
will
never
lead
to
the
proper
results
rubinstein
paid
little
or
no
attention
to
the
theory
of
touch
and
in
fact
he
frequently
stated
that
he
cared
little
about
such
things
but
who
could
hear
rubinstein
touch
without
being
benefited
i
believe
that
in
teaching
touch
the
teacher
should
first
give
his
model
of
the
touch
required
and
then
proceed
from
this
positive
ideal
by
means
of
the
socratic
method
of
inducing
the
pupil
to
produce
a
similar
result
through
repeated
questions
in
this
way
the
pupil
will
not
be
obliged
to
resign
his
individuality
as
would
be
the
case
if
he
followed
strict
technical
injunctions
and
rules
students
should
hear
virtuosos
for
the
same
reason
it
is
advisable
for
the
pupil
to
hear
many
fine
pianists
he
should
never
miss
an
opportunity
to
attend
the
concerts
of
great
virtuosos
i
can
frankly
say
that
i
have
learned
as
much
from
hearing
the
concerts
of
great
performers
as
i
have
from
any
other
source
of
educational
inspiration
the
pupil
should
listen
intelligently
and
earnestly
when
he
hears
what
appeals
to
him
as
a
particularly
fine
tonal
effect
he
should
endeavor
to
note
the
means
the
pianist
employs
to
produce
this
effect
he
must
however
learn
to
discriminate
between
affection
or
needless
movement
and
the
legitimate
means
to
an
end
consequent
upon
a
relaxed
full
arm
is
the
occasional
dropping
of
the
wrist
below
the
level
of
the
keyboard
a
few
great
players
practice
this
at
a
public
recital
and
lo
and
behold
a
veritable
cult
of
arises
and
we
see
students
raising
and
lowering
the
wrist
with
exaggerated
mechanical
stiffness
and
entirely
ignoring
the
important
end
in
which
this
wrist
dropping
was
only
an
incident
methods
and
still
more
methods
i
am
continually
amused
at
the
thousand
and
one
different
ways
of
striking
the
keys
that
teachers
devise
and
then
attach
with
the
label
these
varied
contortions
are
after
all
largely
a
matter
of
vision
and
have
little
effect
upon
the
real
musical
results
that
the
composition
demands
touch
as
i
have
previously
said
all
comes
down
to
the
question
of
the
degree
of
weight
applied
to
the
keyboard
and
the
degree
of
quickness
with
which
it
is
applied
in
rapid
octave
and
staccato
passages
the
hand
touch
is
largely
used
this
is
the
touch
most
dependent
upon
local
muscular
activity
aside
from
this
the
combination
of
muscular
and
weight
touch
almost
invariably
obtain
do
neglect
ear
training
i
desire
to
reiterate
that
if
the
ideal
touch
is
presented
to
the
pupil
mind
through
the
medium
of
the
ear
he
will
be
much
more
successful
in
attaining
the
artistic
ends
required
the
pupil
must
realize
clearly
is
and
is
and
his
must
be
continually
educated
in
this
respect
he
should
practice
slowly
and
carefully
at
the
keyboard
until
he
is
convinced
that
his
arm
is
at
all
times
relaxed
he
can
not
make
his
sense
of
touch
too
sensitive
he
should
even
be
able
to
sense
the
weight
or
upward
pressure
which
brings
the
pianoforte
key
back
into
position
after
it
has
been
depressed
the
arm
should
feel
as
if
it
were
floating
and
should
never
be
tense
when
i
am
playing
i
do
not
think
of
the
arm
motion
i
am
of
course
absorbed
in
the
composition
being
performed
a
relaxed
arm
has
become
second
nature
to
me
it
comes
by
itself
players
are
rarely
able
to
tell
just
how
they
produce
their
results
there
are
too
many
contributing
factors
even
with
the
performers
the
effects
differ
at
different
performances
it
is
impossible
for
the
performer
to
give
a
program
repeatedly
in
identically
the
same
manner
if
he
did
succeed
in
doing
this
his
playing
would
soon
become
stereotyped
the
teacher
should
from
the
very
beginning
seek
to
avoid
stiffness
and
bad
hand
positions
such
as
crooked
fingers
or
knuckles
if
these
details
are
neglected
the
pupil
is
liable
to
go
through
his
entire
musical
career
greatly
hampered
i
would
earnestly
advise
all
teachers
to
discourage
the
efforts
of
pupils
to
attain
virtuoso
heights
unless
they
are
convinced
beyond
the
possibility
of
a
doubt
that
the
pupil
has
marvelous
talent
the
really
great
performers
seem
to
be
endowed
with
a
insight
in
the
matter
of
both
technic
and
touch
they
are
unquestionably
born
for
it
they
possess
the
right
mental
and
physical
capacity
for
success
no
amount
of
training
would
make
a
normandy
dray
horse
that
could
compete
with
a
kentucky
thoroughbred
on
the
race
course
it
is
a
pitiful
sight
to
watch
students
who
could
not
possibly
become
virtuosos
slave
year
after
year
before
an
ivory
and
ebony
when
if
they
realized
their
lack
of
personal
qualifications
they
could
engage
in
teaching
or
in
some
other
professional
or
mercantile
line
and
take
a
delight
in
their
music
as
an
avocation
that
they
would
never
find
in
professional
playing
artistic
interpretation
paramount
to
some
the
matter
of
touch
is
of
little
significance
they
are
apparently
born
with
an
appreciation
of
tonal
values
that
others
might
work
years
to
attain
in
vain
those
who
imagine
that
touch
is
entirely
a
matter
of
finger
tips
are
greatly
mistaken
the
ear
is
quite
as
important
as
the
organs
employed
in
administering
the
touch
to
the
keyboard
the
pianist
should
in
reality
not
think
of
the
muscles
and
nerves
in
his
arm
nor
of
the
ivory
and
ebony
keys
nor
of
the
hammers
and
strings
in
the
interior
of
the
instrument
he
should
think
first
and
always
of
the
kind
of
tone
he
is
eliciting
from
the
instrument
and
determine
whether
it
is
the
most
appropriate
tonal
quality
for
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
piece
he
is
playing
he
must
of
course
spend
years
of
hard
thought
and
study
in
cultivating
this
ability
to
judge
and
produce
the
right
touch
but
the
performer
who
is
more
concerned
about
the
technical
claims
of
a
composition
than
its
musical
interpretation
can
only
hope
to
give
an

the

leopold

ideas
upon
technic
often
erroneous
it
is
quite
impossible
in
a
short
talk
to
earnest
music
students
to
do
more
than
discuss
a
few
of
the
more
important
points
in
the
subject
proposed
it
may
safely
be
said
at
the
start
however
that
the
popular
conception
of
technic
is
quite
an
erroneous
one
and
one
that
deserves
correction
it
is
highly
necessary
that
the
student
should
have
a
correct
attitude
of
mind
regarding
this
matter
first
of
all
i
distinguish
between
what
might
be
called
mere
mechanics
and
technic
the
art
of
piano
playing
as
a
whole
seems
to
divide
itself
into
three
quite
distinct
channels
when
it
is
considered
from
the
educational
standpoint
the
first
channel
is
that
of
mechanics
this
would
naturally
include
all
that
pertains
to
that
branch
of
piano
study
which
has
to
do
with
the
exercises
that
develop
the
hand
from
the
machine
standpoint
that
is
make
it
capable
of
playing
with
the
greatest
possible
rapidity
the
greatest
possible
power
when
power
is
needed
and
also
provide
it
with
the
ability
to
play
those
passages
which
because
of
fingering
or
unusual
arrangement
of
the
piano
keys
are
particularly
difficult
to
perform
the
brain
side
of
piano
study
in
the
second
channel
we
would
find
the
study
of
the
technic
of
the
art
of
playing
the
instrument
technic
differs
from
the
mechanics
of
piano
playing
in
that
it
has
properly
to
do
with
the
intellectual
phase
of
the
subject
rather
than
the
physical
it
is
the
brain
side
of
the
study
not
the
digital
or
the
manual
to
the
average
student
who
is
enough
to
spend
hours
hammering
away
at
the
keyboard
developing
the
mechanical
side
of
his
work
a
real
conscious
knowledge
of
the
great
saving
he
could
effect
through
technic
would
be
a
godsend
technic
properly
has
to
do
with
rhythm
tempo
accent
phrasing
dynamics
agogics
touch
etc
the
excellence
of
one
technic
depends
upon
the
accuracy
of
understanding
of
these
subjects
and
his
skill
in
applying
them
to
his
interpretations
at
the
keyboard
mechanical
skill
minus
real
technical
grasp
places
the
player
upon
a
lower
footing
than
the
machines
which
really
do
play
all
the
notes
with
all
the
speed
and
all
the
power
the
operator
demands
some
of
these
instruments
indeed
are
so
constructed
that
many
of
the
important
considerations
that
we
have
placed
in
the
realm
of
technic
are
reproduced
in
a
surprising
manner
the
emotions

not

can
piano
playing
by
machine
include
the
third
and
vastly
important
channel
through
which
we
communicate
the
works
of
the
masters
to
those
who
would
hear
them
that
channel
is
the
emotional
or
artistic
phase
of
piano
playing
it
is
the
channel
which
the
student
must
expect
to
develop
largely
through
his
own
inborn
artistic
sense
and
his
cultivated
powers
of
observation
of
the
playing
of
master
pianists
it
is
the
sacred
fire
communicated
from
one
art
generation
to
the
next
and
modified
by
the
individual
emotions
of
the
performer
himself
even
though
the
performer
may
possess
the
most
highly
perfected
mechanism
technical
mastery
which
enables
him
to
play
great
masterpieces
effectively
if
he
does
not
possess
the
emotional
insight
his
performances
will
lack
a
peculiar
subtlety
and
artistic
power
that
will
deprive
him
of

truly

numbers
there
have
also
been
valuable
attempts
to
provide
books
to
assist
the
student
in
his
technical
work
but
it
should
always
be
remembered
that
this
depends
first
of
all
upon
understanding
and
then
upon
the
ability
to
translate
that
understanding
to
the
instrument
there
can
never
be
any
exercises
in
the
emotional
side
of
the
work
other
than
the
entire
literature
of
the
instrument
one
may
as
well
try
to
capture
the
perfume
of
the
flower
as
define
the
requirements
of
the
emotional
in
pianoforte
playing
a
great
deal
may
be
done
to
inspire
the
student
and
suggest
ideas
which
may
bring
him
to
the
proper
artistic
appreciation
of
a
passage
but
it
is
this
very
indefinability
which
makes
the
emotional
phase
one
of
the
most
important
of
all
attendance
at
the
recitals
of
artistic
pianists
is
of
great
help
in
this
connection
the
student
however
may
learn
a
vast
amount
about
real
piano
technic
and
apply
his
knowledge
to
his
playing
through
the
medium
of
the
proper
studies
for
instance
in
the
subject
of
touch
alone
there
is
a
vast
store
of
valuable
information
which
can
be
gained
from
a
review
of
the
progressive
steps
through
which
this
significant
phase
of
the
subject
has
passed
during
the
last
century
the
art
of
piano
playing
considered
apart
from
that
of
the
similar
instruments
which
preceded
the
piano
is
very
little
over
one
hundred
years
old
changes
in
the
mechanism
of
the
instrument
during
this
time
many
significant
changes
have
been
made
in
the
mechanism
of
the
instrument
and
in
the
methods
of
manufacture
these
changes
in
the
nature
of
the
instrument
have
in
themselves
doubtless
had
much
to
do
with
changes
in
methods
of
touch
as
have
the
natural
evolutions
coming
through
countless
experiments
made
by
teachers
and
performers
thus
we
may
speak
of
the
subject
of
touch
as
being
divided
into
three
epochs
the
first
being
that
of
czerny
characterized
by
a
stroke
touch
the
second
being
that
of
the
famous
stuttgart
conservatory
characterized
by
a
pressure
touch
and
the
third
or
new
epoch
which
is
characterized
by
weight
playing
all
my
own
playing
is
based
upon
the
last
named
method
and
i
had
the
honor
of
being
one
of
the
first
to
make
application
of
it
when
i
commenced
teaching
some
twenty
years
ago
the
significance
of
weight
playing
in
this
method
of
playing
the
fingers
are
virtually
to
the
keys
in
that
they
leave
them
the
least
possible
distance
in
order
to
accomplish
their
essential
aims
this
results
in
no
waste
motion
of
any
kind
no
loss
of
power
and
consequently
the
greatest
possible
conservation
of
energy
in
this
manner
of
playing
the
arm
is
so
relaxed
that
it
would
fall
to
the
side
if
the
keyboard
were
removed
from
beneath
it
since
the
hand
and
the
arm
are
relaxed
the
back
top
of
the
hand
is
almost
on
a
level
with
the
forearm
the
high
angular
stroke
which
characterized
the
playing
of
the
czerny
epoch
and
which
could
hardly
fail
to
cause
tired
muscles
and
unbearably
stiff
playing
is
seen
very
little
in
these
days
by
means
of
it
the
student
was
taught
to
deliver
a
blow
to
the
keyboard
a
blow
which
permitted
very
little
modification
to
the
requirements
of
modern
technic
in
my
experience
as
a
pianist
and
as
a
teacher
i
have
observed
that
the
weight
touch
allows
the
greatest
possible
opportunity
for
the
proper
application
of
those
divisions
of
technic
without
which
piano
playing
is
not
only
inartistic
but
devoid
of
all
interest
weight
playing
permits
nothing
to
interfere
with
discriminative
phrasing
complicated
rhythmical
problems
the
infinitely
subtle
variation
of
time
for
expressive
purposes
now
classed
under
the
head
of
agogics
all
shades
of
dynamic
gradation
in
fact
everything
that
falls
in
the
domain
of
the
artist
pianist
moulding
the
fingers
to
the
keys
in
weight
playing
the
fingers
seem
to
mould
the
piano
keys
under
them
the
hand
and
arm
are
relaxed
but
never
heavy
the
maximum
of
relaxation
results
in
the
minimum
of
fatigue
in
legato
playing
for
instance
the
fingers
rest
upon
the
fleshy
part
behind
the
tip
rather
than
immediately
upon
the
tip
as
they
would
in
passage
work
when
the
player
desired
to
have
the
effect
of
a
string
of
pearls
the
sensation
in
legato
playing
is
that
of
pulling
back
rather
than
striking
the
keys
in
passages
where
force
is
required
the
sensation
is
that
of
pushing
much
might
be
said
of
the
sensibility
of
the
finger
tips
as
they
come
in
contact
with
the
ivory
and
ebony
keys
most
every
artist
has
a
strong
consciousness
that
there
is
a
very
manifest
relation
between
his
emotional
and
mental
conditions
and
his
tactile
sense
that
is
his
highly
developed
sense
of
feeling
at
the
finger
tips
on
the
keyboard
however
the
phenomena
may
be
explained
from
the
psychological
standpoint
it
is
nevertheless
true
that
the
feeling
of
longing
yearning
hope
or
soulful
anticipation
for
instance
induces
a
totally
different
kind
of
touch
from
that
of
anger
resentment
or
hate
the
artist
who
is
incapable
of
communicating
his
emotions
to
the
keyboard
or
who
must
depend
upon
artifice
to
stimulate
emotions
rarely
electrifies
his
audiences
every
concert
is
a
test
of
the
sincerity
not
merely
an
exhibition
of
his
prowess
or
his
acrobatic
accomplishments
on
the
keyboard
he
must
have
some
vital
message
to
convey
to
his
audience
or
else
his
entire
performance
will
prove
meaningless
soulless
worthless
that
which
is
of
great
importance
to
him
is
to
have
the
least
possible
barrier
between
his
artistic
conception
of
the
work
he
would
interpret
and
the
sounds
that
are
conveyed
to
the
ears
of
his
audience
if
we
obliterate
the
emotional
side
and
depend
upon
artifice
or
what
might
be
called
in
vulgar
parlance
tricks
of
the
trade
pianism
will
inevitably
descend
to
a
vastly
lower
level
by
cultivating
a
sensibility
in
touch
and
employing
the
technical
means
which
will
bring
the
message
to
the
world
with
the
least
possible
obstruction
we
reach
the
highest
in
the
art
those
who
would
strain
at
gnats
might
contend
that
with
the
machinery
of
the
instrument
itself
intervening
between
the
touch
at
the
keyboard
and
the
sounding
wires
would
make
the
influence
of
the
emotions
though
the
tactile
sense
sense
of
touch
is
wholly
negligible
to
this
i
can
only
reply
that
the
experience
of
the
artist
and
the
teacher
is
always
more
reliable
more
susceptible
to
finer
appreciations
of
artistic
values
than
that
of
the
pure
theorist
who
views
his
problems
through
material
rather
than
spiritual
eyes
every
observing
pianist
is
familiar
with
the
remarkable
influence
upon
the
nerves
of
the
apparatus
that
any
emotion
makes
is
it
not
reasonable
to
suppose
that
the
finger
tips
possess
a
similar
sensibility
and
that
the
interpretations
of
any
highly
trained
artist
are
duly
affected
through
them
individuality
character
and
temperament
indeed
individuality
character
and
temperament
are
becoming
more
and
more
significant
in
the
highly
organized
art
of
pianoforte
playing
remove
these
and
the
playing
of
the
artist
again
becomes
little
better
than
that
of
a
machine
no
machine
can
ever
achieve
the
distinguishing
charm
that
this
trinity
brings
to
pianoforte
playing
whether
the
performer
is
a
who
has
carefully
developed
the
performance
of
a
masterpiece
until
it
evidences
that
distinguishing
mark
of
the
authoritative
interpretation
or
whether
he
is
a
who
improvises
as
the
mood
of
the
moment
inspires
him
and
never
plays
the
same
composition
twice
in
anything
like
a
similar
manner
he
need
not
fear
the
rivalry
of
any
machine
so
long
as
he
preserves
his
individuality
character
and
temperament
genius
and
work
the
fault
with
many
students
however
is
the
very
erroneous
idea
that
genius
or
talent
will
take
the
place
of
study
and
work
they
minimize

for
a

was
born
at
watford
herts
england
she
commenced
the
study
of
music
at
so
very
youthful
an
age
that
she
made
several
appearances
in
the
english
provinces
before
she
was
twelve
years
of
age
her
talent
aroused
such
interest
that
she
was
sent
to
the
royal
academy
of
music
in
london
there
she
was
placed
under
the
artistic
guidance
of
one
of
the
foremost
english
teachers
of
pianoforte
oscar
beringer
with
whom
she
remained
for
six
years
this
was
followed
by
four
years
under
leschetizky
in
vienna
leschetizky
saw
splendid
opportunities
in
such
talented
and
regularly
trained
material
and
is
said
to
have
given
particularly
careful
attention
to
miss

it
is
not

that
upon
her
return
to
london
miss
goodson
made
a
profound
impression
upon
the
musical
public

laid
the
foundation
for
a
splendid

to
analyze
judging
from
the
mischievous
investigations
of
things
in

which
seem
so
natural
for
the
small
boy
to
make
it
would
appear
that
our
tendency
to
analyze
things
is
innate
we
also
have
innumerable
opportunities
to
observe
how
children
to
say
nothing
of
primitive
people
struggle
to
construct
to
put
this
and
that
together
for
the
purpose
of
making
something
new
in
other
words
to
employ
the
opposite
process
to
analysis
known
as
synthesis
moreover
it
does
not
demand
much
philosophy
to
perceive
that
all
scientific
and
artistic
progress
is
based
upon
these
very
processes
of
analysis
and
synthesis
we
pull
things
apart
to
find
out
how
they
are
made
and
what
they
are
made

them
together
again
to
indicate
the
mastery
of
our
knowledge
the
measure
of
musicianship
is
the
ability
to
do
all
the
analyzing
in
the
world
will
not
benefit
the
pupil
unless
he
can
give
some
visible
indications
of
his
proficiency
indeed
important
as
the
process
is
it
is
possible
to
carry
it
to
extremes
and
neglect
the
building
process
which
leads
to
real
accomplishment
the
first
step
in
analyzing
a
new
piece
a
great
many
of
the
pupils
who
have
come
to
me
indicate
a
lamentable
neglect
in
an
understanding
of
the
very
first
things
which
should
have
been
analyzed
by
the
preparatory
teachers
it
is
an
expensive
process
to
study
with
a
public
artist
unless
the
preparation
has
been
thoroughly
made
reputation
naturally
places
a
higher
monetary
value
upon
the
services
of
the
virtuoso
and
for
the
student
to
expect
instruction
in
elementary
points
in
analysis
is
obviously
an
extravagance
the
virtuoso
time
during
the
lesson
period
should
be
spent
in
the
finer
study
of
interpretation
not
in
those
subjects
which
the
elementary
teacher
should
have
completed
often
the
teacher
of
an
advanced
pupil
is
deceived
at
the
start
and
assumes
that
the
pupil
has
a
knowledge
which
future
investigations
reveal
that
he
does
not
possess
for
instance
the
pupil
should
be
able
to
determine
the
general
structure
of
a
piece
he
is
undertaking
and
should
be
so
familiar
with
the
structure
that
it
becomes
a
form
of
second
nature
to
him
if
the
piece
is
a
sonata
he
should
be
able
to
identify
the
main
theme
and
the
secondary
theme
whenever
they
appear
or
whenever
any
part
of
them
appears
inability
to
do
this
indicates
the
most
superficial
kind
of
study
the
student
should
know
enough
of
the
subject
of
form
in
general
to
recognize
the
periods
into
which
the
piece
is
divided
without
this
knowledge
how
could
he
possibly
expect
to
study
with
understanding
even
though
he
has
passed
the
stage
when
it
is
necessary
for
him
to
mark
off
the
periods
he
should
not
study
a
new
piece
without
observing
the
outlines
the
architectural
plans
the
composer
laid
down
in
constructing
the
piece
it
is
one
thing
for
a
sir
christopher
wren
to
make
the
plans
of
a
great
cathedral
like
paul
and
quite
another
thing
for
him
to
get
master
builders
to
carry
out
those
plans
by
studying
the
architectural
plan
carefully
the
student
will
find
that
he
is
saving
an
immense
amount
of
time
for
example
let
us
consider
the
chopin
minor
in
this
composition
the
main
theme
comes
three
times
each
time
in
a
different
key
once
learned
in
one
key
it
should
be
very
familiar
in
the
next
key
the
student
should
also
know
something
of
the
history
of
the
dance
and
he
should
be
familiar
with
the
characteristics
of
the
different
national
dances
each
national
dance
form
has
something
more
than
a
rhythm
it
has
an
atmosphere
the
word
atmosphere
may
be
a
little
loose
in
its
application
here
but
there
seems
to
be
no
other
word
to
describe
what
i
mean
the
flavor
of
the
spanish
bolero
is
very
different
from
the
hungarian
czardas
and
who
could
confound
the
intoxicating
swirl
of
the
italian
tarantella
with
the
stately
air
of
cluny
lace
and
silver
rapiers
which
seems
to
surround
the
minuet
the
minuet
by
the
way
is
frequently
played
too
fast
the
minuet
from
beethoven
eighth
symphony
is
a
notable
example
many
conductors
have
made
the
error
of
rushing
through
it
hans
richter
conducts
it
with
the
proper
tempo
this
subject
in
itself
takes
a
tremendous
amount
of
consideration
and
the
student
should
never
postpone
this
first
step
in
the
analysis
of
the
works
he
is
to
perform
the
poetic
idea
of
the
piece
despite
the
popular
impression
that
music
is
imitative
in
the
sense
of
being
able
to
reproduce
different
pictures
and
different
emotions
it
is
really
very
far
from
it
the
subject
of
program
music
and
illustrative
music
is
one
of
the
widest
in
the
art
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
least
definite
except
in
cases
like
the
beethoven
where
the
composer
has
made
obvious
attempts
to
suggest
rural
scenes
composers
do
not
as
a
rule
try
to
make
either
aquarelles
or
cycloramas
with
their
music
they
write
music
for
what
it
is
worth
as
music
not
as
scenery
very
often
the
public
or
some
wily
publisher
applies
the
title
as
in
the
case
of
the
or
some
of
the
mendelssohn
without
of
course
there
are
some
notable
exceptions
and
many
teachers
may
be
right
in
trying
to
stimulate
the
sluggish
imaginations
of
some
pupils
with
fanciful
stories
however
when
there
is
a
certain
design
in
a
piece
which
lends
itself
to
the
suggestion
of
a
certain
idea
as
does
for
instance
the
from
the
it
is
interesting
to
work
with
a
specific
picture
in
view
but
never
forgetting
the
real
beauty
of
the
piece
purely
as
a
beautiful
piece
of
music
some
pieces
with
special
titles
are
notoriously
misnamed
and
carry
no
possible
means
of
definitely
intimating
what
the
composer
intended
even
some
forms
are
misleading
in
their
names
the
of
chopin
are
often
very
remote
from
the
playful
significance
of
the
word
a
significance
which
is
beautifully
preserved
in
the
of
mendelssohn
studying
the
rhythm
a
third
point
in
analyzing
a
new
piece
might
be
analyzing
the
rhythm
it
is
one
thing
to
understand
or
to
comprehend
a
rhythm
and
another
to
preserve
it
in
actual
playing
rhythm
depends
upon
the
arrangement
of
notes
and
accents
in
one
or
two
measures
which
give
a
characteristic
swing
to
the
entire
composition
rhythm
is
an
altar
upon
which
many
idols
are
smashed
sometimes
one
is
inclined
to
regard
rhythm
as
a
kind
of
sacred
gift
whatever
it
may
be
it
is
certainly
most
difficult
to
acquire
or
better
to
absorb
a
good
rhythm
indicates
a
finely
balanced
musician
one
who
knows
how
and
one
who
has
perfect
all
the
book
study
in
the
world
will
not
develop
it
it
is
a
knack
which
seems
to
come
intuitively
or
at
once
when
it
does
come
my
meaning
is
clear
to
anyone
who
has
struggled
with
the
problem
of
playing
two
notes
against
three
for
at
times
it
seems
impossible
but
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
conflicting
rhythms
apparently
jump
into
place
and
thereafter
the
pupil
has
little
difficulty
with
them
rhythmic
swing
is
different
from
rhythm
but
is
allied
to
it
as
it
is
allied
to
tempo
to
get
the
swing
the
impelling
force
the
student
must
have
played
many
pieces
which
have
a
tendency
to
develop
this
swing
the
big
waltzes
of
moszkowski
are
fine
for
this
if
one
of
pupils
had
difficulty
with
rhythm
he
almost
invariably
advised
them
to
go
to
hear
the
concerts
of
that
king
of
rhythm
and
dance
eduard
strauss
dances
are
invaluable
in
developing
this
sense
of
rhythm
dances
like
the
bolero
and
the
tarantella
are
especially
helpful
certain
pieces
demand
a
particularly
strict
observance
of
the
rhythm
as
does
the
opus
of
chopin
in
which
the
left
hand
must
adhere
very
strictly
to
the
valse
rhythm
the
analysis
of
phrases
the
ability
to
see
the
phrases
by
which
a
composition
is
built
clearly
and
readily
simplifies
the
study
of
interpretation
of
a
new
piece
wonderfully
this
of
course
is
difficult
at
first
but
with
the
proper
training
the
pupil
should
be
able
to
see
the
phrases
at
a
glance
just
as
a
botanist
in
examining
a
new
flower
would
divide
it
in
his
eye
into
its
different
parts
he
would
never
mistake
the
calyx
for
a
petal
and
he
would
be
able
to
determine
at
once
the
peculiarities
of
each
part
in
addition
to
the
melodic
phrases
the
pupil
should
be
able
to
see
the
metrical
divisions
which
underlie
the
form
of
the
piece
he
should
be
able
to
tell
whether
the
composition
is
one
of
sections
or
sections
or
whether
the
sections
are
irregular
what
a
splendid
thing
it
would
be
if
little
children
at
their
first
lessons
were
taught
the
desirability
of
observing
melodic
phrases
teachers
lay
great
stress
upon
hand
formation
with
the
object
of
getting
the
pupil
to
keep
the
hand
in
a
perfect
condition
a
condition
that
is
the
result
of
a
carefully
developed
habit
why
not
develop
the
habit
of
noting
the
phrases
in
the
same
way
why
not
a
little
mind
formation
it
is
a
great
deal
nearer
the
real
musical
aim
than
the
mere
digital
work
the
most
perfectly
formed
hand
in
the
world
would
be
worthless
for
the
musician
unless
the
mind
that
operates
the
hand
has
had
a
real
musical
training
studying
the
harmony
every
piano
student
ought
to
have
a
knowledge
of
harmony
but
this
knowledge
should
be
a
practical
one
what
do
i
mean
by
a
practical
knowledge
of
harmony
simply
this
a
knowledge
of
harmony
which
recognizes
the
ear
as
well
as
the
eye
there
are
students
of
harmony
who
can
work
out
some
harmonic
problem
with
the
skill
of
an
expert
mathematician
and
yet
they
never
for
one
single
moment
think
of
the
music
their
notes
might
make
this
is
due
to
the
great
neglect
of
the
study
of
in
early
musical
education
to
be
able
to
recognize
a
chord
when
you
see
it
on
paper
is
not
nearly
such
an
acquisition
as
the
ability
to
recognize
the
same
chord
when
it
is
played
the
student
who
can
tell
a
diminished
seventh
or
an
augmented
sixth
at
a
glance
but
who
could
not
identify
the
same
chords
when
he
saw
them
through
his
ears
instead
of
his
eyes
is
severely
handicapped
but
how
many
musicians
can
do
this
should
be
one
of
the
first
of
all
studies
it
may
be
acquired
more
easily
in
childhood
if
the
student
is
not
naturally
gifted
with
it
and
it
is
the
only
basis
of
a
thorough
knowledge
of
harmony
the
piano
teacher
can
not
possibly
find
time
to
give
sufficient
instruction
in
the
subject
of
harmony
at
the
piano
lesson
it
demands
a
separate
period
and
in
most
cases
it
is
necessary
and
advisable
to
have
a
separate
teacher
that
is
one
who
has
made
a
specialty
of
harmony
the
piano
itself
is
of
course
a
great
help
to
the
student
in
the
study
of
harmony
providing
the
student
listens
all
the
time
he
is
playing
few
adult
piano
students
study
string
instruments
such
as
the
violin
or
instruments
which
cultivate
the
perception
of
hearing
far
more
than
can
the
piano
for
this
reason
all
children
should
have
the
advantage
of
a
course
in
this
should
not
be
training
for
pitch
alone
but
for
quality
of
tone
as
well
it
may
be
supplemented
with
exercises
in
musical
dictation
until
the
pupil
is
able
to
write
down
short
phrases
with
ease
after
he
has
heard
them
once
a
pupil
who
has
had
such
a
training
would
make
ideal
material
for
the
advanced
teacher
and
because
of
the
greatly
developed
powers
of
the
pupil
would
be
able
to
memorize
quicker
and
make
much
better
progress
in
fact
and
harmony
lead
to
great
economy
of
time
for
instance
let
us
suppose
that
the
pupil
has
a
chord
like
the
following
in
a
sonata
illustration
if
the
same
chord
appeared
again
in
the
piece
it
would
probably
be
found
in
the
key
of
the
dominant
thus
illustration
it
seems
very
obvious
that
if
the
pupil
could
perceive
the
harmonic
relationship
between
these
two
chords
he
would
be
spared
the
trouble
of
identifying
an
entirely
different
chord
when
he
finds
the
repetition
of
it
merely
in
another
key
this
is
only
one
of
scores
of
instances
where
a
knowledge
of
the
harmonic
structure
proves
to
be
of
constant
importance
to
the
student
a
careful
analysis
of
touch
effects
here
again
we
find
an
interminable
subject
although
there
are
only
a
few
principal
divisions
into
which
the
subject
of
touch
might
be
divided
the
number
of
different
subdivisions
of
these
best
known
methods
of
striking
the
keys
to
produce
artistic
effects
is
very
considerable
the
artist
working
day
in
and
day
out
at
the
keyboard
will
discover
some
subtle
touch
effects
which
he
will
always
associate
with
a
certain
passage
he
may
have
no
logical
reason
for
doing
this
other
than
that
it
appeals
to
his
artistic
sense
he
is
in
all
probability
following
no
law
but
that
of
his
own
musical
taste
and
sense
of
hearing
it
is
this
more
than
anything
else
which
gives
individuality
to
the
playing
of
the
different
virtuosos
and
makes
their
efforts
so
different
from
the
playing
of
machines
time
and
time
again
mechanical
efforts
have
been
made
to
preserve
all
these
infinite
subtilities
and
some
truly
wonderful
machines
have
been
invented
but
not
until
the
marble
can
be
made
to
glow
with
the
vitality
of
real
flesh
can
this
be
accomplished
wonderful
as
the
mechanical
inventions
are
there
is
always
something
lacking
here
again
will
benefit
the
pupil
who
is
studying
with
a
virtuoso
teacher
it
is
impossible
to
show
exactly
how
certain
touches
produce
certain
effects
the
ear
however
hears
these
effects
and
if
the
pupil
has
the
right
kind
of
persistence
he
will
work
and
work
until
he
is
able
to
reproduce
the
same
effect
that
he
has
heard
then
it
will
be
found
that
the
touch
he
employs
will
be
very
similar
to
that
used
by
the
virtuoso
he
has
heard
it
may
take
weeks
to
show
a
certain
pupil
a
kind
of
touch
the
pupil
with
the
trained
ear
and
the
willingness
to
work
might
be
able
to
pick
up
the
same
touch
and
produce
the
same
effect
after
a
few
days
a
highly
developed
sense
of
hearing

of
immense

attends

josef
hofmann
was
born
at
cracow
russia
january
his
father
was
an
exceptionally
successful
teacher
and
was
for
a
time
professor
of
harmony
and
composition
at
the
warsaw
conservatory
the
elder
talents
were
by
no
means
limited
to
teaching
however
since
he
conducted
the
opera
at
warsaw
for
many
performances
he
undertook
the
training
of
his
son
with
great
care
and
since
the
child
showed
remarkable
promise
the
musicians
of
russia
took
an
extraordinary
interest
in
him
he
appeared
in
public
at
the
age
of
six
and
before
he
was
ten
years
of
age
he
was
the
most
celebrated
child
prodigy
of
his
time
he
traveled
thousands
of
miles
including
tours
of
america
playing
complicated
classical
compositions
in
a
manner
which
surprised
musicians
everywhere
fortunately
for
his
health
and
education
his
tours
were
terminated
in
time
for
him
to
study
for
the
advanced
work
of
the
more
mature
artist
accordingly
he
was
placed
with
the

josef
hofmann
the
question
of
progress
in
pianoforte
playing
is
one
that
admits
of
the
widest
possible
discussion
one
is
frequently
asked
whether
the
manner
of
playing
the
pianoforte
has
undergone
any
change
since
the
time
of
hummel
and
if
it
has
advanced
of
what
nature
are
the
advances
and
to
what
particular
condition
are
the
advances
due
johann
nepomuk
hummel
it
will
be
remembered
was
contemporary
with
beethoven
and
was
in
fact
a
kind
of
bridge
between
the
old
and
the
new
he
made
his
début
at
a
concert
given
by
mozart
at
dresden
for
a
time
he
was
a
kind
of
assistant
to
haydn
and
indeed
many
at
that
time
thought
his
works
were
quite
on
a
par
with
those
of
the
great
master
beethoven
hummel
was
a
really
great
virtuoso
and
was
noted
for
his
remarkable
improvisations
his
style
of
playing
was
taken
as
a
model
in
his
time
and
consequently
we
may
safely
start
with
this
epoch
by
way
of
example
what
determines
changes
in
playing
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
changes
in
the
construction
of
the
piano
have
caused
a
different
treatment
of
it
but
this
reasoning
is
superficial
inasmuch
as
the
structural
changes
of
the
instrument
itself
are
called
forth
by
the
demands
of
the
made
upon
the
instrument
so
long
as
the
tone
quality
action
and
nature
of
the
instrument
sufficed
for
compositions
of
the
type
of
those
of
domenico
scarlatti
or
françois
couperin
or
rameau
there
was
little
need
for
change
but
as
the
more
modern
composers
longed
for
new
and
more
comprehensive
effects
the
kept
up
with
their
desires
and
aims
thus
it
is
that
after
all
is
said
and
done
the
composer
and
the
composer
only
is
responsible
for
the
changes
the
literature
of
the
piano
determines
them
it
is
the
same
in
the
advancement
of
piano
technic
and
interpretation
the
composers
conceive
new
and
often
radically
different
musical
ideas
these
in
turn
demand
a
new
manner
of
interpretation
this
kind
of
evolution
has
been
going
on
continually
since
the
invention
of
the
instrument
and
is
going
on
only
it
is
more
difficult
for
us
to
see
it
in
the
present
than
it
is
to
review
it
in
the
past
the
general
mental
tendencies
of
the
times
the
artistic
and
cultural
influences
of
the
world
taken
as
a
whole
have
also
had
a
conspicuous
though
somewhat
less
pronounced
share
in
these
matters
since
they
inevitably
exert
an
influence
upon
the
interpreter
speaking
from
a
strictly
pianistic
point
of
view
it
is
the
player
individuality
influenced
by
the
factors
just
stated
which
is
the
determining
element
in
producing
new
pianistic
tendencies
it
is
thus
very
evident
that
progress
in
piano
playing
since
the
epoch
of
hummel
has
been
enormous
the
new
technic
and
the
old
you
ask
me
what
are
the
essential
differences
between
the
modern
technic
and
the
technic
of
the
older
periods
it
is
very
difficult
to
discuss
this
question
and
it
is
one
which
might
better
be
discussed
in
an
article
of
a
different
character
one
difficulty
lies
in
the
regrettable
tendency
of
modern
technic
toward
being
a
purpose
in
itself
judging
from
the
manner
in
which
some
ambitious
young
players
work
their
sole
aim
is
to
become
human
machines
quite
without
any
real
musical
consciousness
before
radically
condemning
this
tendency
however
it
should
be
remembered
that
it
has
brought
us
many
undeniable
advantages
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
we
owe
to
the
ingenious
investigators
of
technical
subjects
greater
possibilities
in
effective
polyphonic
playing
economy
of
power
and
arm
motion
larger
participation
of
the
mind
in
the
acquisition
of
technic
and
numerous
other
praiseworthy
factors
in
good
piano
playing
in
the
olden
days
while
technical
exercises
were
by
no
means
absent
they
were
not
nearly
so
numerous
and
more
time
was
given
to
the
real
musical
elements
in
the
study
of
the
musical
compositions
themselves
if
the
excellent
technical
ideas
to
be
found
in
some
of
the
systems
of
are
employed
solely
to
secure
real
musical
and
artistic
effects
that
is
effects
based
upon
known
æsthetic
principles
the
new
technic
will
prove
valuable
and
we
should
be
very
grateful
for
it
however
as
soon
as
it
becomes
an
objective
point
in
itself
and
succeeds
in
eclipsing
the
higher
purposes
of
musical
interpretation
just
so
soon
should
it
be
abolished
if
the
black
charcoal
sketch
which
the
artist
puts
upon
canvas
to
use
as
an
outline
shows
through
the
colors
of
the
finished
painting
no
masterpiece
will
result
really
artistic
piano
playing
is
an
impossibility
until
the
outlines
of
technic
have
been
erased
to
make
way
for
true
interpretation
from
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
there
is
much
more
in
this
than
most
young
artists
think
and
the
remedy
may
be
applied
at
once
by
students
and
teachers
in
their
daily
work
technic
since
liszt
again
you
ask
whether
technic
has
made
any
significant
advance
since
the
time
of
franz
liszt
here
again
you
confront
me
with
a
subject
difficult
to
discuss
within
the
confines
of
a
conference
there
is
so
much
to
be
said
upon
it
a
mere
change
in
itself
does
not
imply
either
progress
or
retrogression
it
is
for
this
reason
we
can
not
speak
of
progress
since
the
time
of
liszt
to
play
as
liszt
did
that
is
exactly
as
he
did
as
a
mirror
reflects
an
object
would
not
be
possible
to
anyone
unless
he
were
endowed
with
an
individuality
and
personality
exactly
like
that
of
liszt
since
no
two
people
are
exactly
alike
it
is
futile
to
compare
the
playing
of
any
modern
pianist
with
that
of
franz
liszt
to
discuss
accurately
the
playing
of
liszt
from
the
purely
technical
standpoint
is
also
impossible
because
so
much
of
his
technic
was
and
also
a
mere
manual
expression
of
his
unique
personality
and
that
which
his
own
mind
had
created
he
may
perhaps
never
be
equalled
in
certain
respects
but
on
the
other
hand
there
are
unquestionably
pianists
who
would
have
astonished
the
great
master
with
their
technics
i
speak
technically
purely
technically
definite
methods
are
little
more
than
stencils
i
have
always
been
opposed
to
definite
methods
when
they
are
given
in
an
arbitrary
fashion
and
without
the
care
of
the
intelligent
teacher
to
adapt
special
need
to
special
pupils
methods
of
this
kind
can
only
be
regarded
as
a
kind
of
musical
stencil
or
like
the
dies
that
are
used
in
factories
to
produce
large
numbers
of
precisely
similar
objects
since
art
and
its
merits
are
so
strangely
dependent
upon
individuality
and
this
includes
anatomical
individuality
as
well
as
psychological
individuality
an
inflexible
method
must
necessarily
have
a
deadening
effect
upon
its
victims
the
question
of
whether
special
technical
studies
of
an
arbitrary
nature
such
as
scale
studies
should
be
extensively
used
is
one
which
has
been
widely
debated
and
i
fear
will
be
debated
for
years
to
come
let
us
understand
first
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
studying
and
practicing
they
resemble
each
other
only
in
so
far
as
they
both
require
energy
and
time
many
sincere
and
ambitious
students
make
the
great
mistake
of
confounding
these
two
very
essential
factors
of
pianistic
success
study
and
practice
really
are
quite
widely
removed
from
each
other
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
virtually
inseparable
the
real
difference
lies
in
the
amount
and
quality
of
the
two
elements
practice
means
a
large
number
of
repetitions
with
a
fair
amount
of
attention
to
mere
correctness
of
notes
fingering
etc
under
ordinary
circumstances
and
conditions
it
usually
means
a
great
sacrifice
of
time
and
a
comparatively
small
investment
of
mentality
study
on
the
contrary
implies
first
of
all
mental
activity
of
the
highest
and
most
concentrated
type
it
absolute
accuracy
in
notes
time
fingerings
and
implies
the
closest
possible
attention
to
those
things
which
are
generally
though
erroneously
regarded
as
lying
outside
of
technic
such
as
tonal
beauty
dynamic
shading
rhythmical
matters
and
the
like
some
have
the
happy
gift
of
combining
practice
with
study
but
this
is
rare
hence
in
the
question
of
scale
exercises
if
the
word
study
is
meant
in
the
true
sense
i
can
only
say
that
the
study
of
scales
is
more
than
necessary
it
is
indispensable
the
pedagogical
experts
of
the
world
are
practically
unanimous
upon
this
subject
the
injunction
study
applies
not
only
to
scales
but
to
all
forms
of
technical
discipline
which
only
too
often
are
practiced
without
being
studied
i
will
not
deny
that
mere
practicing
as
i
have
defined
it
may
bring
some
little
benefit
but
this
benefit
is
gained
at
an
enormous
expenditure
of
time
and
physical
and
mental
exertion
oh
the
endless
leagues
that
ambitious
fingers
have
traveled
over
ivory
keys
only
too
often
they
race
like
automobiles
on
a
in
a
circle
and
after
having
gone
innumerable
miles
and
spent
a
tremendous
amount
of
energy
they
arrive
at
the
same
point
from
which
they
started
exhausted
and
worn
with
very
little
to
show
for
their
work
and
no
nearer
their
real
goal
than
when
they
started
the
proportion
in
which
mental
and
physical
activity
is
compounded
determines
to
my
mind
the
distinction
between
practicing
and
real
study
one
might
also
say
that
the
proportion
in
which
real
study
enters
into
the
daily
work
of
the
student
determines
the
success
of
the
student
the
study
of
details
imperative
study
demands
that
the
student
shall
delve
into
the
minute
details
of
his
art
and
master
them
before
he
attempts
to
advance
only
the
most
superficial
students
fail
to
do
this
in
these
days
all
of
the
better
trained
teachers
insist
upon
it
and
it
is
hard
for
the
pupil
to
skim
through
on
the
thinnest
possible
theoretical
ice
as
they
did
in
past
years
the
separate
study
of
embellishments
for
instance
is
decidedly
necessary
especially
in
connection
with
the
embellishments
introduced
by
the
writers
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
in
the
study
of
embellishments
it
is
vitally
important
for
the
student
to
remember
one
or
two
very
important
points
in
connection
with
his
investigation
one
point
is
the
understanding
of
the
nature
of
the
instrument
for
which
the
composer
wrote
when
he
had
the
embellishment
in
mind
the
instruments
of
the
early
eighteenth
century
were
characterized
by
a
tone
so
thin
and
of
such
short
duration
that
the
composers
and
players
and
it
should
be
remembered
that
in
those
days
practically
all
of
the
great
composers
played
and
most
of
the
great
performers
were
composers
had
to
resort
to
all
kind
of
subterfuges
and
tricks
to
produce
the
deception
of
a
prolonged
tone
for
instance
they
had
a
method
of
moving
the
finger
to
and
fro
sideways
upon
a
key
after
it
was
struck
thus
they
produced
a
sort
of
vibrato
not
unlike
that
of
which
we
have
received
an
overdose
in
recent
years
from
violinists
and
this
vibrato
german
was
marked
like
our
modern
shake
thus
illustration
but
if
we
interpret
it
as
a
shake
we
commit
a
grave
error
we
ought
never
to
regard
it
as
a
shake
unless
it
is
obviously
an
integer
of
the
melody
the
other
point
to
be
considered
in
the
study
of
embellishments
is
taste
or
rather
let
me
say
fashion
for
the
fashion
of
those
times
which
in
ornamentation
and
everything
with
it
from
architecture
to
dress
was
by
no
means
an
insignificant
factor
in
music
the
point
is
important
because
it
involves
the
element
of
concessions
which
the
composers
voluntarily
or
from
habit
made
to
the
public
of
their
day
i
seriously
question
the
necessity
of
retaining
these
often
superabundant
embellishments
in
their
entirety
for
i
contend
that
we
study
antique
works
on
account
of
their
musical
substance
and
not
for
the
sake
of
gewgaws
and
frills
which
were
either
induced
by
the
imperfections
of
the
instrument
or
by
the
vitiated
taste
of
times
to
which
the
composer
had
to
yield
it
is
of
course
a
very
difficult
and
responsible
task
to
determine
what
to
retain
and
what
to
discard
this
to
a
large
extent
must
depend
upon
what
part
the
ornament
plays
in
the
melody
of
the
composition
whether
it
is
really
an
integral
part
or
an
artificial
excrescence
by
all
means
never
discard
any
embellishment
which
may
serve
to
emphasize
the
melodic
curve
or
any
one
which
may
add
to
its
declamatory
character
a
taste
assisted
by
experience
will
be
a
fairly
reliable
guide
in
this
matter
however
it
is
hardly
advisable
for
amateurs
with
limited
training
to
attempt
any
home
editing
of
this
kind
those
embellishments
which
we
do
regain
should
in
all
cases
be
executed
as
the
composer
of
the
piece
would
desire
to
hear
them
executed
if
he
could
become
acquainted
with
the
instruments
of
this
of
course
places
the
study
of
ornamentation
with
the
many
auxiliary
musical
branches
which
demand
special
and
separate
attention
johann
sebastian
bach
son
phillip
emanuel
bach
realized
this
and
gave
years
to
the
proper
exposition
of
embellishments
however
the
student
should
realize
that
the
study
of
embellishments
is
only
a
part
of
the
great
whole
and
he
should
not
be
misled
into
accepting
every
little
shake
or
other
little
frippery
and
then
magnifying
it
into
a
matter
of
more
vital
importance
than
the
piece
itself
advisers
the
student
should
form
the
habit
of
determining
things
for
himself
he
will
soon
find
that
he
will
be
surrounded
with
many
advisers
who
if
they
have
their
own
way
may
serve
to
confuse
him
some
virtuosos
regard
their
admirers
and
entertainers
as
the
worst
penalties
of
the
virtuoso
life
whether
they
are
or
are
not
must
of
course
depend
upon
the
artist
character
if
he
accepts
their
compliments
and
courtesies
as
an
expression
of
the
measure
of
pleasure
from
his
playing
he
has
tacitly
allowed
for
that
share
in
their
pleasure
which
is
due
to
their
power
of
appreciation
and
he
can
therefore
only
rejoice
in
having
provided
something
worthy
of
it
the
manner
of
their
expression
the
observations
they
make
the
very
wording
of
their
compliments
will
reveal
quickly
enough
whether
he
has
a
case
of
real
appreciation
before
him
or
a
mere
morbid
mania
to
hobnob
with
celebrities
or
at
least
with
people
who
by
nature
of
their
professional
work
are
often
compelled
against
their
own
desires
to
hold
a
more
or
less
exposed
position
in
the
public
eye
if
he
deals
with
the
latter
and
still
allows
their
compliments
to
go
further
than
the
physical
ear
he
must
be
a
man
of
a
character
so
weak
as
to
make
it
doubtful
that
he
will
ever
produce
anything
worthy
of
sincere
and
earnest
appreciation
more
young
students
are
misled
by
blatant
flattery
than
anything
else
they
become
convinced
that
their
efforts
are
comparable
with
those
of
the
greatest
artist
and
the
desire
for
improvement
diminishes
in
direct
ratio
to
the
rate
in
which
their
opinion
of
their
own
efforts
increases
the
student
should
continually
examine
his

it

hearts
of
the
people
in
sadness
and
in
joy
indicated
the
unconcealable
talent
of
the
russian
people
they
were
longing
to
sing
and
music
became
almost
as
much
a
part
of
their
lives
as
food
it
is
no
wonder
then
that
we
find
among
the
names
of
the
russian
pianists
such
celebrities
as
anton
rubinstein
nicholas
rubinstein
essipoff
siloti
rachmaninoff
gabrilowitsch
scriabin
de
pachmann
safonoff
sapellnikoff
and
many
others
it
seems
as
though
the
russian
must
be
endowed
by
nature
with
those
characteristics
which
enable
him
to
penetrate
the
artistic
maze
that
surrounds
the
wonders
of
music
he
comes
to
music
with
a
new
talent
a
new
gift
and
finds
first
of
all
a
great
joy
in
his
work
much
the
same
might
be
said
of
the
russian
violinists
and
the
russian
singers
many
of
whom
have
met
with
tremendous
success
with
the
musical
child
in
russia
the
russian
parent
usually
has
such
a
keen
love
for
music
that
the
child
is
watched
from
the
very
first
for
some
indication
that
it
may
have
musical
talent
the
parent
knows
how
much
music
brings
into
the
life
of
the
child
and
he
never
looks
upon
the
art
as
an
accomplishment
for
exhibition
purposes
but
rather
as
a
source
of
great
joy
music
is
fostered
in
the
home
as
a
part
of
the
daily
existence
indeed
business
is
kept
far
from
the
russian
fireside
and
the
atmosphere
of
most
homes
of
intelligent
people
is
that
of
culture
rather
than
commerce
if
the
child
is
really
musical
the
whole
household
is
seized
with
the
ambition
to
produce
an
artist
in
my
own
case
i
was
taught
the
rudiments
of
music
at
so
early
an
age
that
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
having
learned
how
to
begin
it
came
to
me
just
as
talking
does
with
the
average
child
at
five
i
could
sing
some
of
the
schumann
songs
and
some
of
those
of
beethoven
the
kind
of
music
the
russian
child
hears
the
russian
child
is
spared
all
contact
with
really
bad
music
that
is
he
hears
for
the
most
part
either
the
songs
of
the
people
or
little
selections
from
classical
or
romantic
composers
that
are
selected
especially
with
the
view
of
cultivating
his
talent
he
has
practically
no
opportunity
to
come
in
contact
with
any
music
that
might
be
described
as
banal
america
is
a
very
young
country
and
with
the
tension
that
one
sees
in
american
life
on
all
sides
there
comes
a
tendency
to
accept
music
that
may
be
most
charitably
described
as
cheap
very
often
the
same
themes
found
in
this
music
skilfully
treated
would
make
worthy
musical
compositions
and
by
this
i
refer
to
the
peculiar
rhythm
and
not
to
the
bad
music
that
americans
have
come
to
class
under
this
head
has
a
peculiar
fascination
for
me
there
is
nothing
objectionable
about
the
unique
rhythm
any
more
than
there
is
anything
iniquitous
about
the
gypsy
melodies
that
have
made
such
excellent
material
for
brahms
liszt
and
sarasate
the
fault
lies
in
the
clumsy
presentation
of
the
matter
and
its
associations
with
vulgar
words
the
rhythm
is
often
fascinating
and
exhilarating
perhaps
some
day
some
american
composer
will
glorify
it
in
the
scherzo
of
a
symphony
in
russia
teachers
lay
great
stress
upon
careful
grading
many
teachers
of
note
have
prepared
carefully
graded
lists
of
pieces
suitable
to
each
stage
of
advancement
i
understand
that
this
same
purpose
is
accomplished
in
america
by
the
publication
of
volumes
of
the
music
itself
in
different
grades
although
i
have
never
seen
any
of
these
collections
the
russian
teacher
of
children
takes
great
care
that
the
advancement
of
the
pupil
is
not
too
rapid
the
pupil
is
expected
to
be
able
to
perform
all
the
pieces
in
one
grade
acceptably
before
going
to
the
next
grade
i
have
had
numerous
american
pupils
and
most
of
them
seem
to
have
the
fault
of
wanting
to
advance
to
a
higher
step
long
before
they
are
really
able
this
is
very
wrong
and
the
pupil
who
insists
upon
such
a
course
will
surely
realize
some
day
that
instead
of
advancing
rapidly
he
is
really
throwing
many
annoying
obstacles
directly
in
his
own
path
instruction
books
many
juvenile
instruction
books
are
used
in
russia
just
as
in
america
some
teachers
however
find
that
with
pupils
starting
at
an
advanced
age
it
is
better
to
teach
the
rudiments
without
a
book
this
matter
of
method
is
of
far
greater
importance
than
the
average
teacher
will
admit
the
teacher
often
makes
the
mistake
of
living
up
in
the
clouds
with
beethoven
bach
chopin
and
brahms
never
realizing
that
the
pupil
is
very
much
upon
the
earth
and
that
no
matter
how
grandly
the
teacher
may
play
the
pupil
must
have
practical
assistance
within
his
grasp
the
main
duty
in
all
elementary
work
is
to
make
the
piano
study
interesting
and
the
teacher
must
choose
the
course
likely
to
arouse
the
most
interest
in
the
particular
pupil
opportunities
for
in
russia
it
may
surprise
the
american
student
to
hear
that
there
are
really
more
opportunities
for
him
to
secure
public
appearances
right
here
in
his
own
country
than
in
russia
in
fact
it
is
really
very
hard
to
get
a
start
in
russia
unless
one
is
able
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
public
very
forcibly
in
america
the
standard
may
not
be
so
high
as
that
demanded
in
the
musical
circles
of
russia
but
the
student
has
many
chances
to
play
that
would
never
come
to
him
in
the
old
world
there
the
only
chance
for
the
young
virtuoso
is
at
the
conservatory
concerts
there
are
many
music
schools
in
russia
that
must
content
themselves
with
private
recitals
but
the
larger
conservatories
have
public
concerts
of
much
importance
concerts
that
demand
the
attendance
of
renowned
artists
and
compel
the
serious
interest
of
the
press
however
these
concerts
are
few
and
far
between
and
only
one
student
out
of
many
hundreds
has
a
chance
to
appear
at
them
one
singular
custom
obtains
in
russia
in
reference
to
concerts
the
pianist
coming
from
some
other
european
country
is
paid
more
than
the
local
pianist
for
instance
although
i
am
russian
by
birth
i
reside
in
germany
and
receive
a
higher
rate
when
i
play
in
russia
than
does
the
resident
artist
in
fact
this
rate
is
often
double
the
young
virtuoso
in
the
early
stages
of
his
career
receives
about
one
hundred
roubles
an
appearance
in
russia
while
the
mature
artist
receives
from
to
the
rouble
while
having
an
exchange
value
of
only
fifty
cents
in
united
states
currency
has
a
purchasing
value
of
about
one
dollar
in
russia
why
russian
pianists
are
famed
for
technic
the
russian
pianist
is
always
famed
for
his
technical
ability
even
the
mediocre
artists
possess
that
the
great
artists
realize
that
the
mechanical
side
of
piano
playing
is
but
the
basis
but
they
would
no
sooner
think
of
trying
to
do
without
that
basis
than
they
would
of
dispensing
with
the
beautiful
artistic
temples
which
they
build
upon
the
substantial
foundation
which
technic
gives
to
them
the
russian
pianists
have
earned
fame
for
their
technical
grasp
because
they
give
adequate
study
to
the
matter
everything
is
done
in
the
most
solid
substantial
manner
possible
they
build
not
upon
sands
but
upon
rock
for
instance
in
the
conservatory
examinations
the
student
is
examined
first
upon
technic
if
he
fails
to
pass
the
technical
examination
he
is
not
even
asked
to
perform
his
pieces
lack
of
proficiency
in
technic
is
taken
as
an
indication
of
a
lack
of
the
right
preparation
and
study
just
as
the
lack
of
the
ability
to
speak
simple
phrases
correctly
would
be
taken
as
a
lack
of
preparation
in
the
case
of
the
actor
particular
attention
is
given
to
the
mechanical
side
of
technic
the
exercises
scales
and
arpeggios
american
readers
should
understand
that
the
full
course
at
the
leading
russian
conservatories
is
one
of
about
eight
or
nine
years
during
the
first
five
years
the
pupil
is
supposed
to
be
building
the
base
upon
which
must
rest
the
more
advanced
work
of
the
artist
the
last
three
or
four
years
at
the
conservatory
are
given
over
to
the
study
of
master
works
only
pupils
who
manifest
great
talent
are
permitted
to
remain
during
the
last
year
during
the
first
five
years
the
backbone
of
the
daily
work
in
all
russian
schools
is
scales
and
arpeggios
all
technic
reverts
to
these
simple
materials
and
the
student
is
made
to
understand
this
from
his
very
entrance
to
the
conservatory
as
the
time
goes
on
the
scales
and
arpeggios
become
more
difficult
more
varied
more
rapid
but
they
are
never
omitted
from
the
daily
work
the
pupil
who
attempted
complicated
pieces
without
this
preliminary
technical
drill
would
be
laughed
at
in
russia
i
have
been
amazed
to
find
pupils
coming
from
america
who
have
been
able
to
play
a
few
pieces
fairly
well
but
who
wonder
why
they
find
it
difficult
to
extend
their
musical
sphere
when
the
whole
trouble
lies
in
an
almost
total
absence
of
regular
daily
technical
work
systematically
pursued
through
several
years
of
course
there
must
be
other
technical
material
in
addition
to
scales
but
the
highest
technic
broadly
speaking
may
be
traced
back
to
scales
and
arpeggios
the
practice
of
scales
and
arpeggios
need
never
be
mechanical
or
uninteresting
this
depends
upon
the
attitude
of
mind
in
which
the
teacher
places
the
pupil
in
fact
the
teacher
is
largely
responsible
if
the
pupil
finds
scale
practice
dry
or
tiresome
it
is
because
the
pupil
has
not
been
given
enough
to
think
about
in
scale
playing
not
enough
to
look
out
for
in
nuance
evenness
touch
rhythm
etc
modern
russian
influence
in
musical
art
most
musicians
of
appreciate
the
fact
that
in
many
ways
the
most
modern
effects
sought
by
the
composers
who
seek
to
produce
extremely
new
effects
have
frequently
been
anticipated
in
russia
however
one
signal
difference
exists
between
the
russians
with
ideas
and
the
composers
of
other
nations
the
russian
advanced
ideas
are
almost
always
the
result
of
a
development
as
were
those
of
wagner
verdi
grieg
haydn
and
beethoven
that
is
constant
study
and
investigations
have
led
them
to
see
things
in
a
newer
and
more
radical
way
in
the
case
of
such
composers
as
debussy
strauss
ravel
reger
and
others
of
the
type
of
musical
philistine
it
will
be
observed
that
to
all
intents
and
purposes
they
started
out
as
innovators
schönberg
is
the
most
recent
example
how
long
will
it
take
the
world
to
comprehend
his
message
if
he
really
has
one
certainly
at
the
present
time
even
the
admirers
of
the
bizarre
in
music
must
pause
before
they
confess
that
they
understand
the
queer
utterings
of
this
newest
claimant
for
the
palm
of
musical
eccentricity
with
debussy
strauss
and
others
it
is
different
for
the
skilled
musician
at
once
recognizes
an
astonishing
facility
to
produce
effects
altogether
new
and
often
wonderfully
fascinating
with
reger
one
seems
to
be
impressed
with
tremendous
effort
and
little
result
strauss
however
is
really
a
very
great
master
so
great
that
it
is
difficult
to
get
the
proper
perspective
upon
his
work
at
this
time
it
is
safe
to
say
that
all
the
modern
composers
of
the
world
have
been
influenced
in
one
way
or
another
by
the
great
russian
masters
of
and
yesterday
tchaikovsky
cui
glazounov
rachmaninov
moussorgsky
arensky
scriabine
and
others
have
all
had
a
powerful
bearing
upon
the
musical
thought
of
the
times
their
virility
and
character
have
been
due
to
the
newness
of
the
field
in
which
they
worked
the
influence
of
the
compositions
of
rubinstein
and
glinka
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
russian
since
they
were
so
saturated
with
european
models
that
they
might
be
ranked
with
gluck
mendelssohn
liszt
and
meyerbeer

better

biographical
vladimir
de
pachmann
was
born
at
odessa
russia
july
his
first
teacher
was
his
father
who
was
a
musical
enthusiast
and
a
fine
performer
upon
the
violin
the
elder
de
pachmann
was
a
professor
of
law
at
the
university
of
vienna
and
at
first
did
not
desire
to
have
his
son
become
anything
more
than
a
cultured
amateur
in
his
youth
de
pachmann
was
largely
self
taught
and
aside
from
hearing
great
virtuosos
at
concerts
and
modeling
his
playing
to
some
extent
after
theirs
he
had
no
teachers
until
when
he
went
to
the
vienna
conservatory
to
study
with
the
then
celebrated
teacher
joseph
dachs
dachs
was
a
concert
pianist
of
the
old
school
academic
perfection
was
his
goal
and
he
could
not
understand
such
a
pupil
as
de
pachmann
who
was
able
to
get
results
by
what
seemed
means
after
one
year
with
dachs
de
pachmann
toured
russia
with
great
success
and
since
then
has
made
repeated
tours
of
the
entire
musical
world
he
never
gave
any
serious
attention
to
musical
composition
as
an
interpreter
of
the
works
of
chopin
no
one
in
recent
times
has
ever
excelled
de
pachmann
but
he
also
gave
numerous
recitals
showing
a
great
breadth
of
style
in
the
performances
of

in

what
does
it
really

nothing

than
the

traditions
mistaken

and

own

us
seek

it
is
gone
like
a

originality
is
in
self
it
is
the
true
voice
of
the
heart
i
would
enjoin
students
to
listen
to
their
own
inner
voices
i
do
not
desire
to
deprecate
teachers
but
i
think
that
many
teachers
are
in
error
when
they
fail
to
encourage
their
pupils
to
form
their
own
opinions
i
have
always
sought
the
individual
in
myself
when
i
have
found
him
i
play
at
my
best
i
try
to
do
everything
in
my
own
individual
way
i
work
for
months
to
invent
contrive
or
design
new
fingerings
not
so
much
for
simplicity
but
to
enable
me
to
manipulate
the
keys
so
that
i
may
express
the
musical
thought
as
it
seems
to
me
it
ought
to
be
expressed
see
my
hand
my
fingers
the
flesh
as
soft
as
that
of
a
child
yet
covering
muscles
of
steel
they
are
thus
because
i
have
worked
from
childhood
to
make
them
thus
the
trouble
with
most
pupils
in
studying
a
piece
is
that
when
they
seek
individuality
and
originality
they
go
about
it
in
the
wrong
way
and
the
result
is
a
studied
stiff
hard
performance
let
them
listen
to
the
voice
i
say
to
the
inner
voice
the
voice
which
is
speaking

machine
teaching
a
certain
amount
of
it
may
be
necessary
but
i
hate
it
it
seems
so
brutal
so
inartistic
instead
of
leading
the
pupil
to
seek
results
for
himself
they
lay
down
laws
and
see
that
these
laws
are
obeyed
like
it
is
possible
of
course
by
means
of
systematic
training
to
educate
a
boy
so
that
he
could
play
a
concerto
which
he
could
not
possibly
comprehend
intelligently
until
he
became
at
least
twenty
years
older
but
please
tell
what
is
the
use
of
such
a
training
is
it
artistic
is
it
musical
would
it
not
be
better
to
train
him
to
play
a
piece
which
he
could
comprehend
and
which
he
could
express
in
his
own
way
of
course
i
am
not
speaking
now
of
the
boy
mozarts
the
boy
liszts
or
other
freaks
of
nature
but
of
the
children
who
by
methods
are
made
to
do
things
which
nature
never
intended
that
they
should
do
this
forcing
method
to
which
some
conservatories
seem
addicted
reminds
one
of
those
men
who
in
bygone
ages
made
a
specialty
of
disfiguring
the
forms
and
faces
of
children
to
make
dwarfs
jesters
and
freaks
out
of
them
bah
originality
the
road
to
permanent
fame
originality
in
interpretation
is
of
course
no
more
important
than
originality
in
creation
see
how
the
composers
who
have
been
the
most
original
have
been
the
ones
who
have
laid
the
surest
foundation
for
permanent
fame
here
again
true
originality
has
been
merely
the
highest
form
of
ê
vero
when
the
composer
has
sought
originality
and
contrived
to
get
it
by
purposely
taking
methods
what
has
he
produced
nothing
but
a
horrible
sham
a
structure
of
cards
which
is
destroyed
by
the
next
wind
of
fashion
other
composers
write
for
all
time
they
are
original
because
they
listen
to
the
little
inner
voice
the
true
source
of
originality
it
is
the
same
in
architecture
styles
in
architecture
are
evolved
not
created
and
whenever
the
architect
has
striven
for
bizarre
effects
he
builds
for
one
decade
only
the
architects
who
build
for
all
time
are
different
and
yet
how
unlike
how
individual
how
original
is
the
work
of
one
great
architect
from
that
of
another
the
most
original
composers
the
most
original
of
all
composers
at
least
as
they
appear
to
me
is
johann
sebastian
bach
perhaps
this
is
because
he
is
the
most
sincere
next
i
should
class
beethoven
that
great
mountain
peak
to
whose
heights
so
few
ever
soar
then
would
come
in
order
liszt
brahms
schumann
chopin
weber
and
mendelssohn
schumann
more
original
than
chopin
yes
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
that
is
there
is
something
more
distinctive
something
more
indicative
of
a
great
individuality
speaking
a
new
language
compare
these
men
with
composers
of
the
order
of
abt
steibelt
thalberg
and
donizetti
and
you
will
see
at
once
what
i
mean
about
originality
being
the
basis
of
permanent
art
for
over
twenty
years
my
great
fondness
for
mineralogy
and
for
gems
led
me
to
neglect
in
a
measure
the
development
of
the
higher
works
of
these
composers
but
i
have
realized
my
error
and
have
been
working
enormously
for
years
to
attain
the
technic
which
their
works
demand
some
years
ago
i
felt
that
technical
development
must
cease
at
a
certain
age
this
is
all
idiocy
i
feel
that
i
have
now
many
times
the
technic
i
have
ever
had
before
and
i
have
acquired
it
all
in
recent
years
the
secret
of
many
successes
no
one
could
possibly
believe
more
in
than
i
the
student
who
goes
to
a
teacher
and
imagines
that
the
teacher
will
cast
some
magic
spell
about
him
which
will
make
him
a
musician
without
working
has
an
unpleasant
surprise
in
store
for
him
when
i
was
eighteen
i
went
to
dachs
at
the
vienna
conservatory
he
bade
me
play
something
i
played
the
paraphrase
of
liszt
dachs
commented
favorably
upon
my
touch
but
assured
me
that
i
was
very
much
upon
the
wrong
track
and
that
i
should
study
the
of
bach
he
assured
me
that
no
musical
education
could
be
considered
complete
without
an
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
bach
fugues
which
of
course
was
most
excellent
advice
consequently
i
secured
a
copy
of
the
fugues
and
commenced
work
upon
them
dachs
had
told
me
to
prepare
the
first
prelude
and
fugue
for
the
following
lesson
but
dachs
was
not
acquainted
with
my
methods
of
study
he
did
not
know
that
i
had
mastered
the
art
of
concentration
so
that
i
could
obliterate
every
suggestion
of
any
other
thought
from
my
mind
except
that
upon
which
i
was
working
he
had
no
estimate
of
my
youthful
zeal
and
intensity
he
did
not
know
that
i
could
not
be
satisfied
unless
i
spent
the
entire
day
working
with
all
my
artistic
might
and
main
soon
i
saw
the
wonderful
design
of
the
great
master
of
eisenach
the
architecture
of
the
fugues
became
plainer
and
plainer
each
subject
became
a
friend
and
each
answer
likewise
it
was
a
great
joy
to
observe
with
what
marvelous
craftsmanship
he
had
built
up
the
wonderful
structures
i
could
not
stop
when
i
had
memorized
the
first
fugue
so
i
went
to
the
next
and
the
next
and
the
next
a
surprised
teacher
at
the
following
lesson
i
went
with
my
book
under
my
arm
i
requested
him
to
name
a
fugue
he
did
and
i
placed
the
closed
book
on
the
rack
before
me
after
i
had
finished
playing
he
was
dumfounded
he
said
come
to
me
to
take
lessons
you
already
know
the
great
fugues
and
i
have
taught
you
nothing
thinking
that
i
would
find
chopin
more
difficult
to
memorize
he
suggested
that
i
learn
two
of
the
etudes
i
came
at
the
following
lesson
with
the
entire
memorized
who
could
withstand
the
alluring
charm
of
the
chopin
etudes
who
could
resist
the
temptation
to
learn
them
all
when
they
are
once
commenced
an
actor
learns
page
after
page
in
a
few
days
and
why
should
the
musician
go
stumbling
along
for
months
in
his
endeavor
to
learn
something
which
he
could
master
in
a
few
hours
with
the
proper
interest
and
the
burning
concentration
without
which
all
music
study
is
a
farce
it
was
thus
during
my
entire
course
with
dachs
he
would
suggest
the
work
and
i
would
go
off
by
myself
and
learn
it
i
had
practically
no
method
each
page
demanded
a
different
method
each
page
presented
entirely
new
and
different
technical
ideas
deep
thought
necessary
as
a
rule
piano
students
do
not
think
deeply
enough
they
skim
over
the
really
difficult
things
and
no
amount
of
persuasion
will
make
them
believe
some
very
simple
things
difficult
take
the
scale
of
c
major
for
instance
this
scale
is
by
far
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
play
it
with
true
legato
at
any
desired
degree
of
force
or
speed
in
any
desired
rhythm
and
with
any
desired
touch
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
achievements
in
all
music
yet
the
young
pupil
will
literally
turn
up
his
nose
at
the
scale
of
c
major
and
at
the
same
time
claim
that
he
is
perfectly
competent
to
play
a
beethoven
sonata
the
scale
of
c
should
be
learned
step
by
step
until
the
practice
habits
are
so
formed
that
they
will
reign
supreme
while
playing
all
the
other
scales
this
is
the
way
to
secure
results
go
deep
into
things
pearls
lie
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
most
pupils
seem
to
expect
them
floating
upon
the
surface
of
the
water
they
never
float
and
the
one
who
would
have
his
scales
shine
with
the
beauty
of
splendid
gems
must
first
dive
deep
for
the
gems
but
what
is
the
use
of
saying
all
this
to
tell
it
to
young
pupils
seems
to
be
a
waste
of
words
they
will
go
on
making
their
mistakes
and
ignoring
the
advice
of
their
teachers
and
mentors
until
the
great
teacher
of
all
experience
forces
them
to
dive
for
the
hidden
riches
take
time
to
do
things
well
every
pianist
advances
at
a
rate
commensurate
with
his
personal
ability
some
pianists
are
slow
in
development
others
with
wonderful
natural
gifts
go
ahead
very
quickly
the
student
will
see
some
pianist
make
wonderful
progress
and
will
sometimes
imitate
him
without
giving
the
time
or
effort
to
study
that
the
other
pianist
has
given
the
artist
will
spend
months
upon
a
chopin
valse
the
student
feels
injured
if
he
can
not
play
it
in
a
day
look
i
will
play
the
wonderful
nocturne
of
chopin
in
g
opus
no
the
legato
thirds
seem
simple
ah
if
i
could
only
tell
you
of
the
years
that
are
behind
those
thirds
the
human
mind
is
peculiar
in
its
methods
of
mastering
the
movements
of
the
fingers
and
to
get
a
great
masterpiece
so
that
you
can
have
supreme
control
over
it
at
all
times
and
under
all
conditions
demands
a
far
greater
effort
than
the
ordinary
music
lover
can
imagine
mastering
artistic
details
each
note
in
a
composition
should
be
polished
until
it
is
as
perfect
as
a
jewel
as
perfect
as
an
indian
diamond
those
wonderful
scintillating
orbs
of
light
in
a
really
great
masterpiece
each
note
has
its
place
just
as
the
stars
the
jewels
of
heaven
have
their
places
in
their
constellations
when
a
star
moves
it
moves
in
an
orbit
that
was
created
by
nature
great
musical
masterpieces
owe
their
existence
to
mental
forces
quite
as
miraculous
as
those
which
put
the
heavens
into
being
the
notes
in
compositions
of
this
kind
are
not
there
by
any
rule
of
man
they
come
through
the
ever
mystifying
source
which
we
call
inspiration
each
note
must
bear
a
distinct
relation
to
the
whole
an
artist
in
jewels
in
making
a
wonderful
work
of
art
does
not
toss
his
jewels
together
in
any
haphazard
way
he
often
has
to
wait
for
months
to
get
the
right
ruby
or
the
right
pearl
or
the
right
diamond
to
fit
in
the
right
place
those
who
do
not
know
might
think
one
gem
just
like
another
but
the
artist
knows
he
has
been
looking
at
gems
examining
them
under
the
microscope
there
is
a
meaning
in
every
facet
in
every
shade
of
color
he
sees
blemishes
which
the
ordinary
eye
would
never
detect
finally
he
secures
his
jewels
and
arranges
them
in
some
artistic
form
which
results
in
a
masterpiece
the
public
does
not
know
the
reason
why
but
it
will
instantly
realize
that
the
work
of
the
artist
is
in
some
mysterious
way
superior
to
the
work
of
the
bungler
thus
it
is
that
the
mind
of
the
composer
works
spontaneously
in
selecting
the
musical
jewels
for
the
diadem
which
is
to
crown
him
with
fame
during
the
process
of
inspiration
he
does
not
realize
that
he
is
selecting
his
jewels
with
lightning
rapidity
but
with
a
highly
cultivated
artistic
judgment
when
the
musical
jewels
are
collected
and
assembled
he
regards
the
work
as
a
whole
as
the
work
of
another
he
does
not
realize
that
he
has
been
going
through
the
process
of
collecting
them
schubert
failed
to
recollect
some
of
his
own
compositions
only
a
few
days
after
he
had
written
them
something
no
one
can
teach
now
the
difficulty
with
students
is
that
they
do
not
take
time
to
polish
the
jewels
which
the
composers
have
selected
with
such
keen
æsthetic
discernment
they
think
it
enough
if
they
merely
succeed
in
playing
the
note
how
horrible
a
machine
can
play
the
notes
but
there
is
only
one
machine
with
a
soul
and
that
is
the
artist
to
think
that
an
artist
should
play
only
the
notes
and
forget
the
glories
of
the
inspiration
which
came
in
the
composer
mind
during
the
moment
of
creation
let
me
play
the
d
flat
chopin
nocturne
for
you
please
notice
how
the
notes
all
bear
a
relation
to
each
other
how
everything
is
in
right
proportion
do
you
think
that
came
in
a
day
ah
my
friend
the
polishing
of
those
jewels
took
far
longer
than
the
polishing
of
the
kohinoor
yet
i
have
heard
young
girls
attempt
to
play
this
piece
for
me
expecting
approbation
of
course
and
i
am
certain
that
they
could
not
have
practiced
upon
it
more
than
a
year
or
so
they
evidently
think
that
musical
masterpieces
can
be
brought
into
being
like
the
cobwebs
which
rise
during
the
night
to
be
torn
down
by
the
weight
of
the
dew
of
the
following
morning
the
best
teacher
they
play
just
as
their
teachers
have
told
them
to
play
which
is
of
course
good
as
far
as
it
goes
but
they
stop
at
that
and
no
worthy
teacher
expects
his
pupil
to
stop
with
his
instruction
the
best
teacher
is
the
one
who
incites
his
pupil
to
penetrate
deeper
and
learn
new
beauties
by
himself
a
teacher
in
the
highest
sense
of
the
word
is
not
a
mint
coining
pupils
as
it
were
and
putting
the
same
stamp
of
worth
upon
each
pupil
the
great
teacher
is
an
artist
who
works
in
men
and
women
every
pupil
is
different
and
he
must
be
very
quick
to
recognize
these
differences
he
should
first
of
all
teach
the
pupil
that
there
are
hundreds
of
things
which
no
teacher
can
ever
hope
to
teach
he
must
make
his
pupil
keenly
alert
to
this
there
are
hundreds
of
things
about
my
own
playing
which
are
virtually
impossible
to
teach
i
would
not
know
how
to
convey
them
to
others
so
that
they
might
be
intelligently
learned
such
things
i
have
found
out
for
myself
by
long
and
laborious
experimentation
the
control
of
my
fifth
finger
in
certain
fingerings
presented
endless
problems
which
could
only
be
worked
out
at
the
keyboard
such
things
give
an
individuality
to
the
pianist
art
something
which
can
not
be
copied
have
you
ever
been
in
a
foreign
art
gallery
and
watched
the
copyists
trying
to
reproduce
the
works
of
the
masters
have
you
ever
noticed
that
though
they
get
the
form
the
design
and
even
the
colors
and
also
that
with
all
these
resemblances
there
is
something
which
distinguishes
the
work
of
the
master
from
the
work
of
the
copyist
something
so
wonderful
that
even
a
child
can
see
it
you
wonder
at
this
no
one
can
learn
by
copying
the
secret
the
master
has
learned
in
creating
the
basis
of
greatness
here
we
have
a
figure
which
brings
out
very
clearly
the
real
meaning
of
originality
in
piano
playing
and
at
the
same
time
indicates
how
every
pupil
with
or
without
a
teacher
should
work
for
himself
why
was
the
great
liszt
greater
than
any
pianist
of
his
time
simply
because
he
found
out
certain
pianistic
secrets
which
czerny
or
any
of
teachers
and
contemporaries
had
failed
to
discover
why
has
godowsky
godowsky
der
ist
wirklich
ein
grosser
how
has
he
attained
his
wonderful
rank
because
he
has
worked
out
certain
contrapuntal
and
technical
problems
which
place
him
in
a
class
all
by
himself
i
consider
him
the
greatest
master
of
the
mysteries
of
counterpoint
since
the
heyday
of
classical
polyphony
why
does
busoni
produce
inimitable
results
at
the
keyboard
simply
because
he
was
not
satisfied
to
remain
content
with
the
knowledge
he
had
obtained
from
others
this
then
is
my
life
secret
work
unending
work
i
have
no
other
secrets
i
have
developed
myself
along
the
lines
revealed
to
me
by
my
inner
voice
i
have
studied
myself
as
well
as
my
art
i
have
learned
to
study
mankind
through
the
sciences
and
through
the
great
literary
treasures
you
see
i
speak
many
languages
fluently
i
have
stepped
apace
with
the
crowd
i
have
drunk
the
bitter
and
the
sweet
from
the
chalices
of
life
but
remember
i
have
never
stopped
and
i
am
just
as
keenly
interested
in
my
progress
as
i
was
many
years
ago
as
a
youth
the
new
repertoire
of
the
works
of
liszt
and
brahms
and
other
composers
demanded
a
different
technic
a
bigger
technic
what
exquisite
joy
it
was
to
work
for
it
yes
work
is

acquiring
the
requisite
technic
the
preservation
of
one
individuality
in
playing
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
difficult
and
at
the
same
time
one
of
the
most
essential
tasks
in
the
study
of
the
pianoforte
the
kind
of
technical
study
that
passes
the
student
through
a
certain
process
apparently
destined
to
make
him
as
much
like
his
predecessors
as
possible
is
hardly
the
kind
of
technic
needed
to
make
a
great
artist
technical
ability
after
all
is
said
and
done
depends
upon
nothing
more
than
physiologically
correct
motion
applied
to
the
artistic
needs
of
the
masterpiece
to
be
performed
it
implies
a
clear
understanding
of
the
essentials
in
bringing
out
the
composer
idea
the
pupil
must
not
be
confused
with
inaccurate
thinking
for
instance
we
commonly
hear
of
the
touch
more
pupils
have
been
hindered
through
this
clumsy
terminology
than
i
should
care
to
estimate
there
can
not
be
a
wrist
touch
since
the
wrist
is
nothing
more
than
a
wonderful
natural
hinge
of
bone
and
muscle
with
the
pupil
mind
centered
upon
his
wrist
he
is
more
than
likely
to
stiffen
it
and
form
habits
which
can
only
be
removed
with
much
difficulty
by
the
teacher
this
is
only
an
instance
of
one
of
the
loose
expressions
with
which
the
terminology
of
technic
is
encumbered
when
the
pupil
comes
to
recognize
the
wrist
as
a
rather
than
a
thing
he
will
find
that
the
matter
of
the
tight
cramped
wrist
will
cease
to
have
its
terrors
in
fact
as
far
as
touch
itself
is
concerned
the
motion
of
the
arm
as
a
whole
is
vastly
more
important
than
that
of
the
wrist
the
wrist
is
merely
part
of
the
apparatus
which
communicates
the
weight
of
the
arm
to
the
keyboard
innovators
should
be
pianists
in
my
opinion
the
technical
needs
of
the
piano
are
likely
to
be
far
better
understood
by
the
virtuoso
pianist
than
by
one
who
has
never
been
through
the
experiences
which
lead
to
the
concert
platform
please
do
not
infer
that
i
would
say
that
all
teachers
should
be
virtuoso
pianists
i
am
referring
particularly
to
the
makers
of
methods
i
am
continually
confronted
in
my
teaching
with
all
manner
of
absurd
ideas
in
piano
technic
for
instance
one
pupil
will
come
and
exhibit
an
exercise
which
requires
her
to
press
hard
upon
the
keyboard
after
the
note
is
struck
just
why
there
should
be
this
additional
waste
of
nerve
force
when
it
can
have
no
possible
effect
upon
the
depressed
key
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
there
is
enough
nervous
energy
expended
in
pianoforte
study
as
it
is
without
exacting
any
more
from
the
pupil
pupils
are
frequently
carried
away
with
some
technical
trick
of
this
kind
like
a
child
with
a
new
toy
they
do
these
things
without
ever
consulting
their
own
judgment
the
whole
idea
of
technic
then
is
to
achieve
a
position
conscious
effort
where
one
may
conscious
effort
not
until
this
can
be
accomplished
can
we
hope
for
real
in
playing
nothing
is
so
odious
as
the
obtrusion
of
technic
in
any
work
of
art
technic
is
the
trellis
concealed
beneath
the
foliage
and
the
blossoms
of
the
bower
when
the
artist
is
really
great
all
idea
of
technic
is
forgotten
he
must
be
absorbed
by
the
sheer
beauty
of
his
musical
message
his
expression
of
his
musical
self
in
listening
to
rubinstein
or
to
liszt
one
forgot
all
idea
of
technic
and
it
must
be
so
with
all
great
artists
in
every
branch
of
art
in
every
age
what
we
claim
when
we
attend
a
recital
is
the
individual
artist
unrestrained
by
mechanical
bonds
very
few
of
the
great
masters
of
pianoforte
playing
have
delved
very
deeply
into
the
technical
pedagogical
side
of
their
art
as
for
instance
have
tausig
ehrlich
or
joseffy
all
of
whom
have
produced
remarkable
works
on
technic
liszt
contribution
to
the
technic
of
the
instrument
was
made
through
his
pieces
not
through
exercises
his
contributions
to
the
lebert
and
stark
stuttgart
conservatory
method
consist
of
two
concert
studies
personally
i
am
opposed
to
set
methods
that
is
those
that
pretend
to
teach
the
pupil
of
what
value
is
the
teacher
if
he
is
not
to
apply
his
knowledge
with
the
discretion
that
comes
with
experience
deppe
influence
to
this
day
is
far
more
theoretical
than
practical
this
does
not
imply
that
deppe
did
not
evolve
some
very
useful
ideas
in
pianoforte
work
all
of
present
technic
is
a
common
heritage
from
many
investigators
and
innovators
pianoforte
teaching
as
a
matter
of
fact
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
tasks
it
is
easy
to
teach
it
along
conventional
cut
and
dried
method
lines
but
the
teachers
of
real
importance
are
those
who
have
the
ability
the
gift
the
inclination
and
the
experience
to
make
a
brand
new
method
for
every
pupil
in
order
to
develop
the
means
to
communicate
one
message
through
art
with
the
greatest
effectiveness
there
must
be
a
mastery
of
the
delicate
balance
between
natural
tendencies
and
discipline
if
the
student
is
subjected
to
too
much
discipline
stiff
angular
results
may
be
expected
if
the
student
is
permitted
to
play
with
the
flabby
looseness
which
some
confuse
with
natural
relaxation
characterless
playing
must
invariably
result
the
great
desideratum
is
the
fine
equilibrium
between
nature
and
discipline
this
may
seem
an
unnecessary
observation
to
some
but
many
students
never
seem
to
be
able
to
strike
the
happy
medium
between
marching
over
the
keys
like
a
regiment
of
wooden
soldiers
or
crawling
over
them
like
a
lot
of
spineless
caterpillars
avoid
playing
there
is
a
certain
something
which
defines
the
individuality
of
the
player
and
it
seems
well
nigh
impossible
to
say
just
what
this
something
is
let
us
by
all
means
preserve
it
imagine
the
future
of
music
if
every
piece
were
to
be
played
in
the
selfsame
way
by
every
player
like
a
series
of
ordinary
piano
playing
machines
the
remarkable
apparatus
for
recording
the
playing
of
virtuosos
and
then
reproducing
it
through
a
mechanical
contrivance
is
somewhat
of
a
revelation
to
the
pianist
who
tries
it
for
the
first
time
in
the
records
of
the
playing
of
artists
whose
interpretations
are
perfectly
familiar
to
me
there
still
remain
unquestioned
marks
of
individuality
sometimes
these
marks
are
small
shortcomings
but
which
nevertheless
are
so
slight
that
they
do
no
more
than
give
character
look
at
a
painting
by
van
dyke
and
then
at
one
upon
a
similar
subject
by
rembrandt
and
you
will
realize
how
these
little
characteristics
influence
the
whole
outward
aspect
of
an
art
work
both
van
dyke
and
rembrandt
were
dutchmen
and
in
a
sense
contemporaries
they
used
pigments
and
brushes
canvas
and
oil
yet
the
masterpieces
of
each
are
readily
distinguishable
by
any
one
slightly
familiar
with
their
styles
it
is
precisely
the
same
with
pianists
all
of
us
have
arms
fingers
muscles
and
nerves
but
what
we
have
to
say
upon
the
keyboard
should
be
an
expression
of
our
own
minds
not
a
replica
of
some
stereotyped
model
when
i
listened
to
the
first
record
of
my
own
playing
i
heard
things
which
seemed
unbelievable
to
me
was
i
after
years
of
public
playing
actually
making
mistakes
that
i
would
be
the
first
to
condemn
in
any
one
of
my
own
pupils
i
could
hardly
believe
my
ears
and
yet
the
unrelenting
machine
showed
that
in
some
places
i
had
failed
to
play
both
hands
exactly
together
and
had
been
guilty
of
other
errors
no
less
heinous
because
they
were
trifling
i
also
learned
in
listening
to
my
own
playing
as
reproduced
that
i
had
unconsciously
brought
out
certain
nuances
emphasized
different
voices
and
employed
special
accents
without
the
consciousness
of
having
done
so
altogether
it
made
a
most
interesting
study
for
me
and
it
became
very
clear
that
the
personality
of
the
artist
must
permeate
everything
that
he
does
when
his
technic
is
sufficiently
great
it
permits
him
to
speak
with
fluency
and
enhancing
the
value
of
his
work
a
thousandfold
broad
understanding
necessary
it
would
be
a
great
mistake
for
the
student
to
imagine
that
by
merely
acquiring
finger
dexterity
and
a
familiarity
with
a
certain
number
of
pieces
he
may
consider
himself
proficient
there
is
vastly
more
to
than
that
he
must
add
to
his
digital
ability
and
his
repertoire
and
comprehensive
grasp
of
the
principles
of
music
itself
the
pupil
should
strive
to
accomplish
as
much
as
possible
through
mental
work
the
old
idea
of
attempting
to
play
every
single
study
written
by
czerny
or
cramer
or
the
other
prolific
writers
of
studies
is
a
huge
mistake
a
judicious
selection
from
the
works
of
these
pedagogical
writers
is
desirable
but
certainly
not
all
of
them
they
are
at
best
only
the
material
with
which
one
must
work
for
a
certain
aim
and
that
aim
should
be
high
artistic
results
it
should
be
realized
by
all
students
and
teachers
that
this
same
study
material
excellent
in
itself
may
actually
produce
bad
results
if
not
properly
practiced
i
have
repeatedly
watched
students
practicing
industriously
but
becoming
worse
and
worse
and
actually
cultivating
faults
rather
than
approaching
perfection
the
student
must
always
remember
that
his
fingers
are
only
the
outward
organs
of
his
inner
consciousness
and
while
his
work
may
be
mechanical
in
part
he
should
never
think
mechanically
the
smallest
technical
exercise
must
have
its
own
direction
its
own
aim
nothing
should
be
done
without
some
definite
purpose
in
view
the
student
should
have
pointed
out
to
him
just
what
the
road
he
must
travel
is
and
where
it
leads
to
the
ideal
teacher
is
the
one
who
gives
the
pupil
something
to
take
home
and
work
out
at
home
not
the
one
who
works
out
the
student
lesson
for
him
in
the
class
room
the
teacher
greatest
mission
is
to
raise
the
consciousness
of
the
pupil
until
he
can
appreciate
his
own
powers
for
developing
an
idea
freedom
from
convention
oh
the
horror
of
the
conventional
the
absolutely
right
the
human
machine
who
can
not
make
an
error
the
balance
between
the
frigidly
correct
and
the
abominably
loose
is
a
most
difficult
one
to
maintain
it
is
of
course
desirable
that
the
young
student
pass
through
a
certain
period
of
strict
discipline
but
if
this
discipline
succeeds
in
making
an
automaton
of
what
earthly
use
is
it
is
it
really
necessary
to
instruct
our
little
folks
to
think
that
everything
must
be
done
in
a
cut
and
dried
manner
take
the
simple
matter
of
time
for
instance
listen
to
the
playing
of
most
young
pupils
and
you
will
hear
nothing
but
a
kind
of
railroad
train
rhythm
every
measure
bumps
along
precisely
like
the
last
one
the
pupil
has
been
taught
to
observe
the
bar
signs
like
stone
walls
partitioning
the
whole
piece
off
into
sections
the
result
as
a
whole
is
too
awful
to
describe
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
bar
signs
necessary
as
they
are
as
when
we
are
learning
the
elements
of
notation
are
often
the
means
of
leading
the
poorly
trained
pupil
to
a
wholly
erroneous
interpretation
for
instance
in
a
passage
like
the
following
from
beethoven
f
minor
sonata
opus
no
dedicated
to
joseph
haydn
beethoven
idea
must
have
been
the
following
illustration
before
it
was
divided
into
measures
by
bar
lines
as
now
found
printed
illustration
the
trouble
with
the
pupil
in
playing
the
above
is
that
he
seems
inclined
to
observe
the
bar
lines
very
carefully
and
lose
all
idea
of
the
phrase
as
a
whole
music
should
be
studied
by
phrases
not
by
measures
in
studying
a
poem
you
strive
first
of
all
to
get
the
meaning
as
expressed
in
his
phrases
and
in
his
sentences
you
do
not
try
to
mumble
a
few
words
in
an
arbitrary
manner
the
pupil
who
never
gets
over
the
habit
of
playing
in
measures
who
never
sees
the
message
as
a
whole
rather
than
in
little
segments
can
never
play
artistically
many
students
fail
to
realize
that
in
some
pieces
it
is
actually
misleading
to
count
the
beats
in
the
measure
the
rhythm
of
the
piece
as
a
whole
is
often
marked
by
a
series
of
measures
and
one
must
count
the
measures
as
units
rather
than
the
notes
in
the
measures
for
instance
the
following
section
from
a
chopin
valse
opus
no
sometimes
called
the
may
best
be
counted
by
counting
the
measures
thus
illustration
every
pupil
knows
that
the
first
beat
in
each
ordinary
measure
of
time
carries
a
strong
accent
the
third
beat
the
next
strongest
and
the
second
and
fourth
beats
still
weaker
accents
in
a
series
of
measures
which
may
be
counted
in
fours
it
will
be
found
that
the
same
arrangement
often
prevails
the
pupil
will
continually
meet
opportunities
to
study
his
work
along
broader
lines
and
the
wonderful
part
of
it
all
is
that
music
contains
so
much
that
is
interesting
and
surprising
that
there
need
be
no
end
to
his
investigations
every
page
from
a
master
work
that
has
been
studied
for
years
is
likely
to
contain

rachmaninoff
biographical
sergei
vassilievitch
rachmaninoff
was
born
at
novgorod
russia
april
at
the
moscow
conservatory
he
was
placed
under
the
instruction
of
siloti
who
had
been
one
of
the
favorite
russian
pupils
of
franz
liszt
this
master
imparted
a
very
facile
technic
to
rachmaninoff
and
made
him
so
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
best
literature
of
the
instrument
that
his
compositions
became
recognized
at
once
as
those
of
a
thorough
master
of
the
keyboard
his
teacher
in
composition
was
arensky
who
in
addition
to
his
skill
in
the
technic
of
the
art
had
a
fund
of
melody
which
is
a
delight
to
all
those
who
know
his
works
in
rachmaninoff
won
the
great
gold
medal
at
the
moscow
conservatory
and
his
work
as
a
composer
commenced
to
attract
favorable
attention
throughout
all
europe
in
addition
to
this
his
ability
as
a
pianist
attracted
wide
notice
and
his
tours
have
been
very
successful
his
compositions
have
been
cast
in
many
different
forms
from
opera
to
songs
and
piano
pieces
his
most
popular
work
is
prelude
in
c
sharp
which
is
in
the
repertoire
of
all
advanced
students
his
appointment
as
supervisor
general
of
the
imperial
conservatories
of
russia
was
one
of
the
highest
distinctions
that
could
be
conferred
in
the
land
of
the
czar
the
correct
pronunciation
of
the
name
as
given
by
the
composer
is
the
following
conference

xvi
essentials
of
artistic
playing
rachmaninoff
forming
the
proper
conception
of
a
piece
it
is
a
seemingly
impossible
task
to
define
the
number
of
attributes
of
really
excellent
pianoforte
playing
by
selecting
ten
important
characteristics
however
and
considering
them
carefully
one
at
a
time
the
student
may
learn
much
that
will
give
him
food
for
thought
after
all
one
can
never
tell
in
print
what
can
be
communicated
by
the
living
teacher
in
undertaking
the
study
of
a
new
composition
it
is
highly
important
to
gain
a
conception
of
the
work
as
a
whole
one
must
comprehend
the
main
design
of
the
composer
naturally
there
are
technical
difficulties
which
must
be
worked
out
measure
by
measure
but
unless
the
student
can
form
some
idea
of
the
work
in
its
larger
proportions
his
finished
performance
may
resemble
a
kind
of
musical
patchwork
behind
every
composition
is
the
architectural
plan
of
the
composer
the
student
should
endeavor
first
of
all
to
discover
this
plan
and
then
he
should
build
in
the
manner
in
which
the
composer
would
have
had
him
build
you
ask
me
how
can
the
student
form
the
proper
conception
of
the
work
as
a
whole
doubtless
the
best
way
is
to
hear
it
performed
by
some
pianist
whose
authority
as
an
interpreter
can
not
be
questioned
however
many
students
are
so
situated
that
this
course
is
impossible
it
is
also
often
quite
impossible
for
the
teacher
who
is
busy
teaching
from
morning
to
night
to
give
a
rendering
of
the
work
that
would
be
absolutely
perfect
in
all
of
its
details
however
one
can
gain
something
from
the
teacher
who
can
by
his
genius
give
the
pupil
an
idea
of
the
artistic
demands
of
the
piece
if
the
student
has
the
advantage
of
hearing
neither
the
virtuoso
nor
the
teacher
he
need
not
despair
if
he
has
talent
talent
ah
that
is
the
great
thing
in
all
musical
work
if
he
has
talent
he
will
see
with
the
eyes
of
that
wonderful
force
which
penetrates
all
artistic
mysteries
and
reveals
the
truths
as
nothing
else
possibly
can
then
he
grasps
as
if
by
intuition
the
composer
intentions
in
writing
the
work
and
like
the
true
interpreter
communicates
these
thoughts
to
his
audience
in
their
proper
form
technical
proficiency
it
goes
without
saying
that
technical
proficiency
should
be
one
of
the
first
acquisitions
of
the
student
who
would
become
a
fine
pianist
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
of
fine
playing
that
is
not
marked
by
clean
fluent
distinct
elastic
technic
the
technical
ability
of
the
performer
should
be
of
such
a
nature
that
it
can
be
applied
immediately
to
all
the
artistic
demands
of
the
composition
to
be
interpreted
of
course
there
may
be
individual
passages
which
require
some
special
technical
study
but
generally
speaking
technic
is
worthless
unless
the
hands
and
the
mind
of
the
player
are
so
trained
that
they
can
encompass
the
principal
difficulties
found
in
modern
compositions
in
the
music
schools
of
russia
great
stress
is
laid
upon
technic
possibly
this
may
be
one
of
the
reasons
why
some
of
the
russian
pianists
have
been
so
favorably
received
in
recent
years
the
work
in
the
leading
russian
conservatories
is
almost
entirely
under
supervision
of
the
imperial
musical
society
the
system
is
elastic
in
that
although
all
students
are
obliged
to
go
through
the
same
course
special
attention
is
given
to
individual
cases
technic
however
is
at
first
made
a
matter
of
paramount
importance
all
students
must
become
technically
proficient
none
are
excused
it
may
be
interesting
to
hear
something
of
the
general
plan
followed
in
the
imperial
music
schools
of
russia
the
course
is
nine
years
in
duration
during
the
first
five
years
the
student
gets
most
of
his
technical
instruction
from
a
book
of
studies
by
hanon
which
is
used
very
extensively
in
the
conservatories
in
fact
this
is
practically
the
only
book
of
strictly
technical
studies
employed
all
of
the
studies
are
in
the
key
of
they
include
scales
arpeggios
and
other
forms
of
exercises
in
special
technical
designs
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
year
an
examination
takes
place
this
examination
is
twofold
the
pupil
is
examined
first
for
proficiency
in
technic
and
later
for
proficiency
in
artistic
playing
pieces
studies
etc
however
if
the
pupil
fails
to
pass
the
technical
examination
he
is
not
permitted
to
go
ahead
he
knows
the
exercises
in
the
book
of
studies
by
hanon
so
well
that
he
knows
each
study
by
number
and
the
examiner
may
ask
him
for
instance
to
play
study
or
or
etc
the
student
at
once
sits
at
the
keyboard
and
plays
although
the
original
studies
are
all
in
the
key
of
c
he
may
be
requested
to
play
them
in
any
other
key
he
has
studied
them
so
thoroughly
that
he
should
be
able
to
play
them
in
any
key
desired
a
metronomic
test
is
also
applied
the
student
knows
that
he
will
be
expected
to
play
the
studies
at
certain
rates
of
speed
the
examiner
states
the
speed
and
the
metronome
is
started
the
pupil
is
required
for
instance
to
play
the
e
flat
major
scale
with
the
metronome
at
eight
notes
to
the
beat
if
he
is
successful
in
doing
this
he
is
marked
accordingly
and
other
tests
are
given
personally
i
believe
this
matter
of
insisting
upon
a
thorough
technical
knowledge
is
a
very
vital
one
the
mere
ability
to
play
a
few
pieces
does
not
constitute
musical
proficiency
it
is
like
those
music
boxes
which
possess
only
a
few
tunes
the
student
technical
grasp
should
be
later
the
student
is
given
advanced
technical
exercises
like
those
of
tausig
czerny
is
also
very
deservedly
popular
less
is
heard
of
the
studies
of
henselt
however
notwithstanding
his
long
service
in
russia
henselt
studies
are
so
beautiful
that
they
should
rather
be
classed
with
pieces
like
the
studies
of
chopin
proper
phrasing
an
artistic
interpretation
is
not
possible
if
the
student
does
not
know
the
laws
underlying
the
very
important
subject
of
phrasing
unfortunately
many
editions
of
good
music
are
found
wanting
in
proper
phrase
markings
some
of
the
phrase
signs
are
erroneously
applied
consequently
the
only
safe
way
is
for
the
student
to
make
a
special
study
of
this
important
branch
of
musical
art
in
the
olden
days
phrase
signs
were
little
used
bach
used
them
very
sparingly
it
was
not
necessary
to
mark
them
in
those
times
for
every
musician
who
counted
himself
a
musician
could
determine
the
phrases
as
he
played
but
a
knowledge
of
the
means
of
defining
phrases
in
a
composition
is
by
no
means
skill
in
executing
the
phrases
is
quite
as
important
the
real
musical
feeling
must
exist
in
the
mind
of
the
composer
or
all
the
knowledge
of
correct
phrasing
he
may
possess
will
be
worthless
regulating
the
tempo
if
a
fine
musical
feeling
or
sensitiveness
must
control
the
execution
of
the
phrases
the
regulation
of
the
tempo
demands
a
kind
of
musical
ability
no
less
exacting
although
in
most
cases
the
tempo
of
a
given
composition
is
now
indicated
by
means
of
the
metronomic
markings
the
judgment
of
the
player
must
also
be
brought
frequently
into
requisition
he
can
not
follow
the
tempo
marks
blindly
although
it
is
usually
unsafe
for
him
to
stray
very
far
from
these
musical
the
metronome
itself
must
not
be
used
with
closed
eyes
as
we
should
say
it
in
russia
the
player
must
use
discretion
i
do
not
approve
of
continual
practice
with
the
metronome
the
metronome
is
designed
to
set
the
time
and
if
not
abused
is
a
very
faithful
servant
however
it
should
only
be
used
for
this
purpose
the
most
mechanical
playing
imaginable
can
proceed
from
those
who
make
themselves
slaves
to
this
little
musical
clock
which
was
never
intended
to
stand
like
a
ruler
over
every
minute
of
the
student
practice
time
character
in
playing
too
few
students
realize
that
there
is
continual
and
marvelous
opportunity
for
contrast
in
playing
every
piece
is
a
piece
unto
itself
it
should
therefore
have
its
own
peculiar
interpretation
there
are
performers
whose
playing
seems
all
alike
it
is
like
the
meals
served
in
some
hotels
everything
brought
to
the
table
has
the
same
taste
of
course
a
successful
performer
must
have
a
strong
individuality
and
all
of
his
interpretations
must
bear
the
mark
of
this
individuality
but
at
the
same
time
he
should
seek
variety
constantly
a
chopin
ballade
must
have
quite
a
different
interpretation
from
a
scarlatti
capriccio
there
is
really
very
little
in
common
between
a
beethoven
sonata
and
a
liszt
rhapsody
consequently
the
student
must
seek
to
give
each
piece
a
different
character
each
piece
must
stand
apart
as
possessing
an
individual
conception
and
if
the
player
fails
to
convey
this
impression
to
his
audience
he
is
little
better
than
some
mechanical
instrument
josef
hofmann
has
the
ability
of
investing
each
composition
with
an
individual
and
characteristic
charm
that
has
always
been
very
delightful
to
me
the
significance
of
the
pedal
the
pedal
has
been
called
the
soul
of
the
piano
i
never
realized
what
this
meant
until
i
heard
anton
rubinstein
whose
playing
seemed
so
marvelous
to
me
that
it
beggars
description
his
mastery
of
the
pedal
was
nothing
short
of
phenomenal
in
the
last
movement
of
the
b
flat
minor
sonata
of
chopin
he
produced
pedal
effects
that
can
never
be
described
but
for
any
one
who
remembers
them
they
will
always
be
treasured
as
one
of
the
greatest
of
musical
joys
the
pedal
is
the
study
of
a
lifetime
it
is
the
most
difficult
branch
of
higher
pianoforte
study
of
course
one
may
make
rules
for
its
use
and
the
student
should
carefully
study
all
these
rules
but
at
the
same
time
these
rules
may
often
be
skilfully
broken
in
order
to
produce
some
very
charming
effects
the
rules
represent
a
few
known
principles
that
are
within
the
grasp
of
our
musical
intelligence
they
may
be
compared
with
the
planet
upon
which
we
live
and
about
which
we
know
so
much
beyond
the
rules
however
is
the
great
universe
the
celestial
system
which
only
the
telescopic
artistic
sight
of
the
great
musician
can
penetrate
this
rubinstein
and
some
others
have
done
bringing
to
our
mundane
vision
beauties
which
they
alone
could
perceive
the
danger
of
convention
while
we
must
respect
the
traditions
of
the
past
which
for
the
most
part
are
very
intangible
to
us
because
they
are
only
to
be
found
in
books
we
must
nevertheless
not
be
bound
down
by
convention
iconoclasm
is
the
law
of
artistic
progress
all
great
composers
and
performers
have
built
upon
the
ruins
of
conventions
that
they
themselves
have
destroyed
it
is
infinitely
better
to
create
than
to
imitate
before
we
can
create
however
it
is
well
to
make
ourselves
familiar
with
the
best
that
has
preceded
us
this
applies
not
only
to
composition
but
to
pianoforte
playing
as
well
the
master
pianists
rubinstein
and
liszt
were
both
marvelously
broad
in
the
scope
of
their
knowledge
they
knew
the
literature
of
the
pianoforte
in
all
its
possible
branches
they
made
themselves
familiar
with
every
possible
phase
of
musical
advancement
this
is
the
reason
for
their
gigantic
prominence
their
greatness
was
not
the
hollow
shell
of
acquired
technic
they
knew
oh
for
more
students
in
these
days
with
the
genuine
thirst
for
real
musical
knowledge
and
not
merely
with
the
desire
to
make
a
superficial
exhibition
at
the
keyboard
real
musical
understanding
i
am
told
that
some
teachers
lay
a
great
deal
of
stress
upon
the
necessity
for
the
pupil
learning
the
source
of
the
inspiration
this
is
interesting
of
course
and
may
help
to
stimulate
a
dull
imagination
however
i
am
convinced
that
it
would
be
far
better
for
the
student
to
depend
more
upon
his
real
musical
understanding
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
schubert
was
inspired
by
a
certain
poem
or
that
chopin
was
inspired
by
a
certain
legend
could
ever
make
up
for
a
lack
of
the
real
essentials
leading
to
good
pianoforte
playing
the
student
must
see
first
of
all
the
main
points
of
musical
relationship
in
a
composition
he
must
understand
what
it
is
that
gives
the
work
unity
cohesion
force
or
grace
and
must
know
how
to
bring
out
these
elements
there
is
a
tendency
with
some
teachers
to
magnify
the
importance
of
auxiliary
studies
and
minimize
the
importance
of
essentials
this
course
is
wrong
and
must
lead
to
erroneous
results
playing
to
educate
the
public
the
virtuoso
must
have
some
far
greater
motive
than
that
of
playing
for
gain
he
has
a
mission
and
that
mission
is
to
educate
the
public
it
is
quite
as
necessary
for
the
sincere
student
in
the
home
to
carry
on
this
educational
work
for
this
reason
it
is
to
his
advantage
to
direct
his
efforts
toward
pieces
which
he
feels
will
be
of
musical
educational
advantage
to
his
friends
in
this
he
must
use
judgment
and
not
overstep
their
intelligence
too
far
with
the
virtuoso
it
is
somewhat
different
he
expects
and
even
demands
from
his
audience
a
certain
grade
of
musical
taste
a
certain
degree
of
musical
education
otherwise
he
would
work
in
vain
if
the
public
would
enjoy
the
greatest
in
music
they
must
hear
good
music
until
these
beauties
become
evident
it
would
be
useless
for
the
virtuoso
to
attempt
a
concert
tour
in
the
heart
of
africa
the
virtuoso
is
expected
to
give
his
best
and
he
should
not
be
criticized
by
audiences
that
have
not
the
mental
capacity
to
appreciate
his
work
the
virtuosos
look
to
the
students
of
the
world
to
do
their
share
in
the
education
of
the
great
musical
public
do
not
waste
your
time
with
music
that
is
trite
or
ignoble
life
is
too
short
to
spend
it
wandering
in
the
barren
saharas
of
musical
trash
the
vital
spark
in
all
good
pianoforte
playing
there
is
a
vital
spark
that
seems
to
make
each
interpretation
of
a
masterpiece
a
living
thing
it
exists
only
for
the
moment
and
can
not
be
explained
for
instance
two
pianists
of
equal
technical
ability
may
play
the
same
composition
with
one
the
playing
is
dull
lifeless
and
sapless
with
the
other
there
is
something
that
is
indescribably
wonderful
his
playing
seems
fairly
to
quiver
with
life
it
commands
interest
and
inspires
the
audience
what
is
this
vital
spark
that
brings
life
to
mere
notes
in
one
way
it
may
be
called
the
intense
artistic
interest
of
the
player
it
is
that
astonishing
thing
known
as
inspiration
when
the
composition
was
originally
written
the
composer
was
unquestionably
inspired
when
the
performer
finds
the
same
joy
that
the
composer
found
at
the
moment
the
composition
came
into
existence
then
something
new
and
different
enters
his
playing
it
seems
to
be
stimulated
and
invigorated
in
a
manner
altogether
marvelous
the
audience
realizes
this
instantly
and
will
even
sometimes
forgive
technical
imperfections
if
the
performance
is
inspired
rubinstein
was
technically
marvelous
and
yet
he
admitted
making
mistakes
nevertheless
for
every
possible
mistake
he
may
have
made
he
gave
in
return
ideas
and
musical
tone
pictures
that
would
have
made
up
for
a
million
mistakes
when
rubinstein
was
overexact
his
playing
lost
something
of
its
wonderful
charm
i
remember
that
upon
one
occasion
he
was
playing
balakireff
at
a
concert
something
distracted
his
attention
and
he
apparently
forgot
the
composition
entirely
but
he
kept
on
improvising
in
the
style
of
the
piece
and
after
about
four
minutes
the
remainder
of
the
composition
came
back
to
him
and
he
played
it
to
the
end
correctly
this
annoyed
him
greatly
and
he
played
the
next
number
upon
the
program
with
the
greatest
exactness
but
strange
to
say
it
lost
the
wonderful
charm
of
the
interpretation
of
the
piece
in
which
his
memory
had
failed
him
rubinstein
was
really
incomparable
even
more
so
perhaps
because
he
was
full
of
human
impulse
and
his
playing
very
far
removed
from
mechanical
perfection
while
of
course
the
student
must
play
the
notes
and
all
of
the
notes
in
the
manner
and
in
the
time
in
which
the
composer
intended
that
they
should
be
played
his
efforts
should
by
no
means
stop
with
notes
every
individual
note
in
a
composition
is
important
but
there
is
something
quite
as
important
as
the
notes
and
that
is
the
soul
after
all
the
vital
spark
is
the
soul
the
soul
is
the
source
of
that
higher
expression
in
music
which
can
not
be
represented
in
dynamic
marks
the
soul
feels
the
need
for
the
and
intuitively
the
mere
matter
of
the
duration
of
a
pause
upon
a
note
depends
upon
its
significance
and
the
soul
of
the
artist
dictates
to
him
just
how
long
such
a
pause
should
be
held
if
the
student
resorts
to
mechanical
rules
and
depends
upon
them
absolutely
his
playing
will
be
soulless
fine
playing
requires
much
deep
thought
away
from
the
keyboard
the
student
should
not
feel
that
when
the
notes
have
been
played
his
task
is
done
it
is
in
fact
only
begun
he
must
make
the
piece
a
part
of
himself
every
note
must
awaken
in
him
a
kind
of
musical
consciousness

i
can
never
thank
my
mother
enough
for
the
splendid
start
she
gave
me
in
my
early
musical
life
she
was
a
wonderful
woman
and
a
veritable
genius
as
a
teacher
see
i
have
here
on
my
piano
a
copy
of
the
schumann
sonata
in
f
sharp
minor
which
she
herself
used
and
which
she
played
with
a
feeling
i
have
never
heard
equaled
there
is
one
thing
in
particular
for
which
i
am
everlastingly
grateful
to
her
before
i
was
taught
anything
of
notes
or
of
the
piano
keyboard
she
took
me
aside
one
day
and
explained
in
the
simple
and
beautiful
tongue
which
only
a
mother
employs
in
talking
to
her
child
the
wonderful
natural
relationships
of
tones
used
in
making
music
whether
this
was
an
inspiration
an
intuition
or
a
carefully
thought
out
plan
for
my
benefit
i
can
not
tell
but
my
mother
put
into
practice
what
i
have
since
come
to
consider
the
most
important
and
yet
the
most
neglected
step
in
the
education
of
the
child
the
fault
lies
in
the
fact
that
most
teachers
at
the
start
do
not
teach
music
rather
musical
notation
and
the
peculiarities
of
the
instrument
nothing
could
possibly
be
more
stultifying
to
the
musical
instinct
of
the
child
for
instance
the
plan
generally
pursued
is
to
let
the
child
grope
over
the
white
keys
of
the
piano
keyboard
and
play
exercises
in
the
scale
of
c
until
he
begins
to
feel
that
the
whole
musical
world
lies
in
the
scale
of
c
with
the
scales
of
f
and
g
as
the
frontiers
the
keys
of
f
sharp
b
d
flat
and
others
are
looked
upon
as
tremendously
difficult
and
the
child
mind
reasons
with
its
own
peculiar
logic
that
these
keys
being
so
much
less
used
must
of
course
be
less
important
the
black
keys
upon
the
keyboard
are
a
consequently
at
the
very
start
the
child
has
a
radically
incorrect
view
of
what
music
really
is
before
notation
existed
before
keyboards
were
invented
people
sang
before
a
child
knows
anything
of
notation
or
a
keyboard
it
sings
it
is
following
its
natural
musical
instinct
notation
and
keyboards
are
simply
symbols
of
music
cages
in
which
the
beautiful
bird
is
caught
they
are
not
music
any
more
than
the
alphabet
is
literature
unfortunately
our
system
of
musical
symbols
and
the
keyboard
itself
are
very
complex
for
the
young
child
it
is
as
difficult
as
are
calculus
and
algebra
for
his
older
brother
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
keys
of
f
sharp
b
and
d
flat
major
are
only
difficult
because
fate
has
made
them
so
it
would
have
served
the
musical
purpose
just
as
well
if
the
pitch
of
the
instruments
employed
had
been
adjusted
so
that
what
is
now
f
sharp
would
be
the
key
of
c
major
that
however
would
not
have
simplified
matters
and
we
have
to
receive
our
long
established
musical
notation
until
we
can
exchange
it
for
a
better
one
at
a
very
early
age
i
was
taken
to
franz
liszt
by
my
mother
liszt
immediately
perceived
my
natural
talent
and
strongly
advised
my
mother
to
continue
my
musical
work
at
the
same
time
he
said
a
child
i
was
exposed
to
criticism
as
a
wunderkind
prodigy
through
the
ignorance
of
my
parents
long
before
i
was
properly
prepared
to
meet
the
inevitable
consequences
of
public
appearance
this
did
incalculable
damage
to
me
let
your
child
be
spared
such
a
fate
my
own
experience
was
disastrous
do
not
let
your
son
appear
in
public
until
he
is
a
mature
artist
my
first
teacher
louis
köhler
was
an
artist
and
a
great
artist
but
he
was
an
rather
than
an
compared
with
many
of
his
contemporaries
his
playing
suffered
immensely
but
he
made
an
art
of
teaching
as
few
other
men
have
done
he
did
not
play
for
his
pupils
to
any
extent
nor
did
he
ask
them
to
imitate
him
in
any
way
his
playing
was
usually
confined
to
general
illustrations
and
suggestions
by
these
means
the
individuality
of
his
pupils
was
preserved
and
permitted
to
develop
so
that
while
the
pupil
always
had
an
excellent
idea
of
the
authoritative
traditions
governing
the
interpretation
of
a
certain
piece
there
was
nothing
that
suggested
the
stilted
or
wooden
performance
of
the
brainless
mimic
he
taught
his
pupils
to
think
he
was
an
indefatigable
student
and
thinker
himself
he
had
what
many
teachers
would
have
considered
peculiar
ideas
upon
technic
köhler
technical
scheme
while
he
invented
many
little
means
whereby
technical
difficulties
could
be
more
readily
overcome
than
by
the
existing
plan
he
could
not
be
called
in
any
way
radical
he
believed
in
carrying
the
technical
side
of
a
pupil
education
up
to
a
certain
point
along
more
or
less
conventional
lines
when
the
pupil
reached
that
point
he
found
that
he
was
upon
a
veritable
height
of
mechanical
supremacy
thereafter
köhler
depended
upon
the
technical
difficulties
presented
in
the
literature
of
the
instrument
to
continue
the
technical
efficiency
acquired
in
other
words
the
acquisition
of
a
technic
was
solely
to
enable
the
pupil
to
explore
the
world
of
music
equipped
in
such
a
way
that
he
was
not
to
be
overcome
by
anything
the
everlasting
continuance
of
technical
exercises
was
looked
upon
by
köhler
as
a
ridiculous
waste
of
time
and
a
great
injury
i
also
hold
this
opinion
let
us
suppose
that
i
were
to
sit
at
the
piano
for
six
or
seven
hours
and
do
nothing
but
play
conventional
finger
exercises
what
happens
to
my
soul
psychologically
considered
during
those
hours
spent
upon
exercises
which
no
man
or
woman
could
possibly
find
anything
other
than
an
irritation
do
not
the
same
exercises
occur
in
thousands
of
pieces
but
in
such
connection
that
the
mind
is
interested
is
it
necessary
for
the
advanced
pianist
to
punish
himself
with
a
kind
of
mental
and
physical
penance
more
trying
perhaps
than
the
devices
of
the
medieval
ascetics
or
the
oriental
priests
of
no
technic
is
the
juggernaut
which
has
ground
to
pieces
more
musicians
than
one
can
imagine
it
produces
a
stiff
wooden
touch
and
has
a
tendency
to
induce
the
pianist
to
believe
that
the
art
of
pianoforte
playing
depends
upon
the
continuance
of
technical
exercises
whereas
the
acquisition
of
technical
ability
should
be
regarded
as
the
beginning
and
not
the
end
when
pupils
leave
your
schools
you
say
that
they
are
having
a
the
acquisition
of
a
technic
is
only
the
commencement
unfortunately
too
many
consider
it
the
end
this
may
perhaps
be
the
reason
why
our
conservatories
turn
out
so
many
bright
and
proficient
young
people
who
in
a
few
years
are
buried
in
oblivion
with
liszt
when
i
had
reached
a
certain
grade
of
advancement
it
was
my
great
fortune
to
become
associated
with
the
immortal
franz
liszt
i
consider
liszt
the
greatest
man
i
have
ever
met
by
this
i
mean
that
i
have
never
met
in
any
other
walk
of
life
a
man
with
the
mental
grasp
splendid
disposition
and
glorious
genius
this
may
seem
a
somewhat
extravagant
statement
i
have
met
many
many
great
men
rulers
jurists
authors
scientists
teachers
merchants
and
warriors
but
never
have
i
met
a
man
in
any
position
whom
i
have
not
thought
would
have
proved
the
inferior
of
franz
liszt
had
liszt
chosen
to
follow
the
career
of
the
man
in
question
liszt
personality
can
only
be
expressed
by
one
word
he
had
the
most
generous
nature
of
any
man
i
have
ever
met
he
had
aspirations
to
become
a
great
composer
greater
than
his
own
measure
of
his
work
as
a
composer
had
revealed
to
him
the
dire
position
of
wagner
presented
itself
he
abandoned
his
own
ambitions
ambitions
higher
than
those
he
ever
held
toward
piano
virtuosity
abandoned
them
completely
to
champion
the
difficult
cause
of
the
great
wagner
what
liszt
suffered
to
make
this
sacrifice
the
world
does
not
know
but
no
finer
example
of
moral
heroism
can
be
imagined
his
conversations
with
me
upon
the
subject
were
so
intimate
that
i
do
not
care
to
reveal
one
word
liszt
pedagogical
methods
his
generosity
and
personal
force
in
his
work
with
the
young
artists
he
assisted
are
hard
to
describe
you
ask
me
whether
he
had
a
certain
method
i
reply
he
abhorred
methods
in
the
modern
sense
of
the
term
his
work
was
eclectic
in
the
highest
sense
in
one
way
he
could
not
be
considered
a
teacher
at
all
he
charged
no
fees
and
had
irregular
and
somewhat
unsystematic
classes
in
another
sense
he
was
the
greatest
of
teachers
sit
at
the
piano
and
i
will
indicate
the
general
plan
pursued
by
liszt
at
a
lesson
reisenauer
is
a
remarkable
and
witty
mimic
of
people
he
desires
to
describe
the
present
writer
sat
at
the
piano
and
played
at
some
length
through
several
short
compositions
eventually
coming
to
the
inevitable
chopin
valse
op
no
in
a
flat
major
in
the
meanwhile
reisenauer
had
gone
to
another
room
and
after
listening
patiently
returned
imitating
the
walk
facial
expression
and
the
peculiar
guttural
snort
characteristic
of
liszt
in
his
later
years
then
followed
a
long
kindly
sermon
upon
the
emotional
possibilities
of
the
composition
this
was
interrupted
with
snorts
and
went
with
kaleidoscopic
rapidity
from
french
to
german
and
back
again
many
many
times
imitating
liszt
he
said
first
of
all
we
must
arrive
at
the
very
essence
of
the
thing
the
germ
that
chopin
chose
to
have
grow
and
blossom
in
his
soul
it
is
roughly
considered
this
illustration
chopin
next
thought
was
no
doubt
illustration
but
with
his
unerring
good
taste
and
sense
of
symmetry
he
writes
it
so
illustration
now
consider
the
thing
in
studying
it
and
while
playing
it
from
the
composer
attitude
by
this
i
mean
that
during
the
mental
process
of
conception
before
the
actual
transference
of
the
thought
to
paper
the
thought
itself
is
in
a
nebulous
condition
the
composer
sees
it
in
a
thousand
lights
before
he
actually
determines
upon
the
exact
form
he
desires
to
perpetuate
for
instance
this
theme
might
have
gone
through
chopin
mind
much
after
this
fashion
illustration
the
main
idea
being
to
reach
the
embryo
of
chopin
thought
and
by
artistic
insight
divine
the
connotation
of
that
thought
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
light
of
the
treatment
chopin
has
given
it
it
is
not
so
much
the
performer
duty
to
play
mere
notes
and
dynamic
marks
as
it
is
for
him
to
make
an
artistic
estimate
of
the
intention
and
to
feel
that
during
the
period
of
reproduction
he
simulates
the
natural
psychological
conditions
which
affected
the
composer
during
the
actual
process
of
composition
in
this
way
the
composition
becomes
a
living
entity
a
tangible
resurrection
of
the
soul
of
the
great
chopin
without
such
penetrative
genius
a
pianist
is
no
more
than
a
mere
machine
and
with
it
he
may
develop
into
an
artist
of
the
highest
type
a
unique
attitude
reisenauer
attitude
toward
the
piano
is
unique
and
interesting
musicians
are
generally
understood
to
have
an
affectionate
regard
for
their
instruments
almost
paternal
not
so
with
reisenauer
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
make
this
statement
i
have
aways
been
drawn
to
the
piano
by
a
peculiar
charm
i
have
never
been
able
to
explain
to
myself
i
feel
that
i
must
play
play
play
play
play
it
has
become
a
second
nature
to
me
i
have
played
so
much
and
so
long
that
the
piano
has
become
a
part
of
me
yet
i
am
never
free
from
the
feeling
that
it
is
a
constant
battle
with
the
instrument
and
even
with
my
technical
resources
i
am
not
able
to
express
all
the
beauties
i
hear
in
the
music
while
music
is
my
very
life
i
nevertheless
hate
the
piano
i
play
because
i
ca
help
playing
and
because
there
is
no
other
instrument
which
can
come
as
near
imitating
the
melodies
and
the
harmonies
of
the
music
i
feel
people
say
wherever
i
go
he
is
a
master
what
absurdity
i
the
master
why
there
is

the
slave
the
future
of
pianoforte
music
an
interesting
question
that
frequently
arises
in
musical
circles
relates
to
the
future
possibilities
of
the
art
of
composition
in
its
connection
with
the
pianoforte
not
a
few
have
some
considerable
apprehension
regarding
the
possible
dearth
of
new
melodic
material
and
the
technical
and
artistic
treatment
of
such
material
i
do
not
think
that
there
need
be
any
fear
of
a
lack
of
original
melodic
material
or
original
methods
of
treating
such
material
the
possibilities
of
the
art
of
musical
composition
have
by
no
means
been
exhausted
while
i
feel
that
in
a
certain
sense
very
difficult
to
illustrate
with
words
one
great
of
composition
for
the
pianoforte
ended
with
liszt
and
the
other
in
brahms
nevertheless
i
can
but
prophesy
the
arising
of
many
new
and
wonderful
schools
in
the
future
i
base
my
prophecy
upon
the
premises
of
frequent
similar
conditions
during
the
history
of
musical
art
nevertheless
it
is
yet
my
ambition
to
give
a
lengthy
series
of
recitals
with
programs
arranged
to
give
a
chronological
aspect
of
all
the
great
masterpieces
in
music
i
hope
to
be
enabled
to
do
this
before
i
retire
it
is
part
of
a
plan
to
circle
the
world
in
a
manner
that
has
not
yet
been
done
when
asked
whether
these
programs
were
to
resemble
rubinstein
famous
historical
recitals
in
london
years
ago
he
replied
they
will
be
more
extensive
than
the
rubinstein
recitals
the
times
make
such
a
series
possible
now
which
rubinstein
would
have
hesitated
to
give
as
to
american
composers
reisenauer
is
so
thoroughly
and
enthusiastically
won
over
by
macdowell
that
he
has
not
given
the
other
composers
sufficient
attention
to
warrant
a
critical
opinion
i
found
upon
questioning
that
he
had
made
a
genuinely
sincere
effort
to
find
new
material
in
america
but
he
said
that
outside
of
macdowell
he
found
nothing
but
indifferently
good
with
the
works
of
several
american
composers
he
was
however
unfamiliar
he
has
done
little
or
nothing
himself
as
a
composer
and
declared
that
it
was
not
his
forte
american
musical
taste
i
find
that
american
musical
taste
is
in
many
ways
astonishing
many
musicians
who
came
to
america
prior
to
the
time
of
thomas
and
damrosch
returned
to
europe
with
what
were
no
doubt
true
stories
of
the
musical
conditions
in
america
at
that
time
these
stories
were
given
wide
circulation
in
europe
and
it
is
difficult
for
europeans
to
understand
the
cultured
condition
of
the
american
people
at
the
present
time
america
can
never
thank
leopold
damrosch
and
theodore
thomas
enough
for
their
unceasing
labors
thanks
to
the
impetus
that
they
gave
the
movement
it
is
now
possible
to
play
programs
in
almost
any
american
city
that
are
in
no
sense
different
from
those
one
is
expected
to
give
in
great
european
capitals
the
status
of
musical
education
in
the
leading
american
cities
is
surprisingly
high
of
course
the
commercial
element
necessarily
affects
it
to
a
certain
extent
but
in
many
cases
this
is
not
as
injurious
as
might
be
imagined
the
future
of
music
in
america
seems
very
roseate
to
me
and
i
can
look
back
to
my
american
concert
tours
with
great
pleasure
concert
conditions
in
america
one
of
the
great
difficulties
however
in
concert
touring
in
america
is
the
matter
of
enormous
distances
i
often
think
that
american
audiences
rarely
hear
great
pianists
at
their
best
considering
the
large
amounts
of
money
involved
in
a
successful
american
tour
and
the
business
enterprise
which
must
be
extremely
forceful
to
make
such
a
tour
possible
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
that
enormous
journeys
must
be
made
in
ridiculously
short
time
no
one
can
imagine
what
this
means
to
even
a
man
of
my
build
reisenauer

a
wonderfully
strong
and
powerful
man
i
have
been
obliged
to

in

city
one
night
and
in
an
eastern
city
the
following
night
hundreds
of
miles
lay
between
them
in
the
latter
city
i
was
obliged
to
go
directly
from
the
railroad
depot
to
the
stage
of
the
concert
hall
hungry
tired
travel
worn
and
without
practice
opportunities
how
can
a
man
be
at
his
best
under
such
conditions
yet
certain
conditions
make
these
things
unavoidable
in
america
and
the
pianist
must
suffer
occasional
criticism
for
not
playing
uniformly
well
in
europe
such
conditions
do
not
exist
owing
to
the
closely
populated
districts
i
am
glad
to
have
the
opportunity
to
make
this
statement
as
no
doubt
a
very
great

americans

to

biographical
emil
sauer
was
born
in
hamburg
germany
october
his
first
teacher
was
his
mother
who
was
a
fine
musician
and
who
took
exceptional
pains
with
her
talented
son
from
to
he
studied
with
nicholas
rubinstein
brother
of
the
famous
anton
rubinstein
nicholas
rubinstein
was
declared
by
many
to
be
a
far
abler
teacher
than
his
brother
who
eclipsed
him
upon
the
concert
platform
from
to
sauer
studied
with
franz
liszt
in
his
autobiographical
work
my
life
sauer
relates
that
liszt
at
that
time
had
reached
an
age
when
much
of
his
reputed
brilliance
had
disappeared
and
the
playing
of
the
great
master
of
weimar
did
not
startle
sauer
as
it
did
some
others
however
liszt
took
a
great
personal
interest
in
sauer
and
prophesied
a
great
future
for
him
in
sauer
made
his
first
tour
as
a
virtuoso
and
met
with
such
favor
that
numerous
tours
of
the
countries
ensued
the
critics
praised
his
playing
particularly
for
his
great
clarity
sanity
symmetrical
appreciation
of
form
and
unaffected
fervor

the
training
of
the
virtuoso
emil
sauer
one
of
the
most
inestimable
advantages
i
have
ever
had
was
my
good
fortune
in
having
a
musical
mother
it
is
to
her
that
i
owe
my
whole
career
as
an
artist
if
it
had
not
been
for
her
loving
care
and
her
patient
persistence
i
might
have
been
engaged
in
some
entirely
different
pursuit
as
a
child
i
was
very
indifferent
to
music
i
abhorred
practice
and
in
fact
showed
no
signs
of
pronounced
talent
until
my
twelfth
year
but
she
kept
faithfully
pegging
away
at
me
and
insisted
that
because
my
grandfather
had
been
a
noted
artist
and
because
she
was
devoted
to
music
it
must
be
in
my
blood
my
mother
was
a
pupil
of
deppe
of
whom
miss
amy
fay
has
written
in
her
book
music
study
in
germany
deppe
was
a
remarkable
pedagogue
and
had
excellent
ideas
upon
the
foundation
of
a
rational
system
of
touch
he
sought
the
most
natural
position
of
the
hand
and
always
aimed
to
work
along
the
line
of
least
resistance
my
mother
instilled
deppe
ideas
into
me
together
with
a
very
comprehensive
training
in
the
standard
etudes
and
classics
within
my
youthful
technical
grasp
for
those
years
i
could
not
have
had
a
better
teacher
lucky
is
the
child
who
like
gounod
reisenauer
and
others
has
had
the
invaluable
instruction
that
a
patient
mother
can
give
the
mother
is
the
most
unselfish
of
all
teachers
and
is
painstaking
to
a
fault
slow
systematic
practice
she
insisted
upon
slow
systematic
regular
practice
she
knew
the
importance
of
regularity
and
one
of
the
first
things
i
ever
learned
was
that
if
i
missed
one
or
two
days
practice
i
could
not
hope
to
make
it
up
by
practicing
overtime
on
the
following
days
practice
days
missed
or
skipped
are
gone
forever
one
must
make
a
fresh
start
and
the
loss
is
sometimes
not
recovered
for
several
days
i
was
also
made
to
realize
the
necessity
of
freshness
at
the
practice
period
the
pupil
who
wants
to
make
his
practice
lead
to
results
must
feel
well
while
practicing
practicing
while
tired
either
mentally
or
physically
is
wasted
practice
pupils
must
learn
to
concentrate
and
if
they
have
not
the
ability
to
do
this
naturally
they
should
have
a
master
who
will
teach
them
how
it
is
not
easy
to
fix
the
mind
upon
one
thing
and
at
the
same
time
drive
every
other
thought
away
with
some
young
pupils
this
takes
much
practice
some
never
acquire
it
it
is
not
in
them
concentration
is
the
vertebræ
of
musical
success
the
student
who
can
not
concentrate
had
better
abandon
musical
study
in
fact
the
young
person
who
can
not
concentrate
is
not
likely
to
be
a
conspicuous
success
in
any
line
of
activity
the
study
of
music
cultivates
the
pupil
powers
of
concentration
perhaps
more
than
any
other
study
the
notes
to
be
played
must
be
recognized
instantaneously
and
correctly
performed
in
music
the
mind
has
no
time
to
wander
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
why
music
is
so
valuable
even
for
those
who
do
not
ever
contemplate
a
professional
career
one
hour
of
concentrated
practice
with
the
mind
fresh
and
the
body
rested
is
better
than
four
hours
of
dissipated
practice
with
the
mind
stale
and
the
body
tired
with
a
fatigued
intellect
the
fingers
simply
dawdle
over
the
keys
and
nothing
is
accomplished
i
find
in
my
own
daily
practice
that
it
is
best
for
me
to
practice
two
hours
in
the
morning
and
then
two
hours
later
in
the
day
when
i
am
finished
with
two
hours
of
hard
study
i
am
exhausted
from
close
concentration
i
have
also
noted
that
any
time
over
this
period
is
wasted
i
am
too
fatigued
for
the
practice
to
be
of
any
benefit
to
me
the
necessity
for
a
good
general
education
parents
make
a
great
mistake
in
not
insuring
the
general
education
of
the
child
who
is
destined
to
become
a
concert
performer
i
can
imagine
nothing
more
stultifying
or
more
likely
to
result
in
artistic
disaster
than
the
course
that
some
parents
take
in
neglecting
the
child
school
work
with
an
idea
that
if
he
is
to
become
a
professional
musician
he
need
only
devote
himself
to
music
this
cultivation
should
be
reserved
for
idiots
who
can
do
nothing
else
the
is
often
the
victim
of
some
mental
disturbance
i
remember
once
seeing
a
remarkable
child
mathematician
in
hungary
he
was
only
twelve
years
of
age
and
yet
the
most
complicated
mathematical
problems
were
solved
in
a
few
seconds
without
recourse
to
paper
the
child
had
water
on
the
brain
and
lived
but
a
few
years
his
usefulness
to
the
world
of
mathematics
was
limited
solely
to
show
purposes
it
is
precisely
the
same
with
the
musical
precocities
they
are
rarely
successful
in
after
life
and
unless
trained
by
some
very
wise
and
careful
teacher
they
soon
become
objects
for
pity
the
child
who
is
designed
to
become
a
concert
pianist
should
have
the
broadest
possible
culture
he
must
live
in
the
world
of
art
and
letters
and
become
a
naturalized
citizen
the
wider
the
range
of
his
information
experience
and
sympathies
the
larger
will
be
the
audience
he
will
reach
when
he
comes
to
talk
to
them
from
the
concert
platform
it
is
the
same
as
with
a
public
speaker
no
one
wants
to
hear
a
speaker
who
has
led
a
narrow
crabbed
intellectual
existence
but
the
man
who
has
seen
and
known
the
world
who
has
become
acquainted
with
the
great
masterpieces
of
art
and
the
wonderful
achievements
of
science
has
little
difficulty
in
securing
an
audience
providing
he
has
mastered
the
means
of
expressing
his
ideas
clean
playing
slovenly
playing
in
the
matter
of
technical
preparation
there
is
perhaps
too
little
attention
being
given
to
the
necessity
for
clean
playing
of
course
each
individual
requires
a
different
treatment
the
pupil
who
has
a
tendency
to
play
with
stiffness
and
rigidity
may
be
given
studies
which
will
develop
a
more
fluent
style
for
these
pupils
studies
like
those
of
heller
are
desirable
in
the
cases
of
students
with
only
moderate
technical
ability
while
the
splendid
etudes
of
chopin
are
excellent
remedies
for
advanced
pupils
with
tendencies
toward
hard
rigid
playing
the
difficulty
one
ordinarily
meets
however
is
ragged
slovenly
playing
rather
than
stiff
rigid
playing
to
remedy
this
slovenliness
there
is
nothing
like
the
works
of
czerny
cramer
or
clementi
i
have
frequently
told
pupils
in
my
meisterschule
in
vienna
before
i
abandoned
teaching
for
my
work
as
a
concert
pianist
that
they
must
learn
to
draw
before
they
learn
to
paint
they
will
persist
in
trying
to
apply
colors
before
they
learn
the
art
of
making
correct
designs
this
leads
to
dismal
failure
in
almost
every
case
technic
first
then
interpretation
the
great
public
has
no
use
for
a
player
with
a
dirty
slovenly
technic
no
matter
how
much
he
strives
to
make
morbidly
sentimental
interpretations
that
are
expected
to
reach
the
lovers
of
sensation
for
such
players
a
conscientious
and
exacting
study
of
czerny
cramer
clementi
and
others
of
similar
design
is
good
musical
soap
and
water
it
washes
them
into
respectability
and
technical
decency
the
pianist
with
a
bungling
slovenly
technic
who
at
the
same
time
attempts
to
perform
the
great
masterpieces
reminds
me
of
those
persons
who
attempt
to
disguise
the
necessity
for
soap
and
water
with
nauseating
perfume
health
a
vital
factor
few
people
realize
what
a
vital
factor
health
is
to
the
concert
pianist
the
student
should
never
fail
to
think
of
this
many
young
americans
who
go
abroad
to
study
break
down
upon
the
very
vehicle
upon
which
they
must
depend
in
their
ride
to
success
through
the
indiscretions
of
overwork
or
wrong
living
the
concert
pianist
really
lives
a
life
of
privation
i
always
make
it
a
point
to
restrict
myself
to
certain
hygienic
rules
on
the
day
before
a
concert
i
have
a
certain
diet
and
a
certain
amount
of
exercise
and
sleep
without
which
i
can
not
play
successfully
in
america
one
is
overcome
with
the
kindness
of
people
who
insist
upon
late
suppers
receptions
etc
it
is
hard
to
refuse
kindness
of
this
description
but
i
have
always
felt
that
my
debt
to
my
audiences
was
a
matter
of
prime
importance
and
while
on
tour
i
refrain
from
social
pleasures
of
all
kinds
my
mind
and
my
body
must
be
right
or
failure
will
surely
result
i
have
often
had
people
say
to
me
after
the
performance
of
some
particularly
brilliant
number
ah
you
must
have
taken
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
give
a
performance
like
that
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth
a
half
a
bottle
of
beer
would
ruin
a
recital
for
me
the
habit
of
taking
alcoholic
drinks
with
the
idea
that
they
lead
to
a
more
fiery
performance
is
a
dangerous
custom
that
has
been
the
ruin
of
more
than
one
pianist
the
performer
who
would
be
at
his
best
must
live
a
very
careful
almost
abstemious
life
any
unnatural
excess
is
sure
to
mar
his
playing
and
lead
to
his
downfall
with
the
public
i
have
seen
this
done
over
and
over
again
and
have
watched
alcohol
tear
down
in
a
few
years
what
had
taken
decades
of
hard
practice
and
earnest
study
to
build
up
judicious
use
of
technical
exercises
the
field
of
music
is
so
enormous
that
i
have
often
thought
that
the
teacher
should
be
very
careful
not
to
overdo
the
matter
of
giving
technical
exercises
technical
exercises
are
at
best
short
cuts
they
are
necessary
for
the
student
he
should
have
a
variety
of
them
and
not
be
kept
incessantly
pounding
away
at
one
or
two
exercises
as
nicholas
rubinstein
once
said
to
me
scales
should
never
be
dry
if
you
are
not
interested
in
them
work
with
them
until
you
become
interested
in
them
they
should
be
played
with
accents
and
in
different
rhythms
if
they
are
given
in
the
shapeless
manner
in
which
some
teachers
obliged
their
unfortunate
pupils
to
practice
them
they
are
worthless
i
do
not
believe
in
working
out
technical
exercises
at
a
table
or
with
a
dumb
piano
the
brain
must
always
work
with
the
fingers
and
without
the
sound
of
the
piano
the
imagination
must
be
enormously
stretched
to
get
anything
more
than
the
most
senseless
toneless
soulless
touch
technic
with
many
is
unmistakably
a
gift
i
say
this
after
having
given
the
matter
much
careful
thought
it
is
like
the
gift
of
speech
some
people
are
fluent
talkers
precisely
as
some
people
can
do
more
in
two
hours
technical
work
at
the
keyboard
than
others
could
accomplish
with
four
of
course
much
can
be
accomplished
with
persistent
practice
and
a
latent
gift
may
be
awakened
but
it
is
certainly
not
given
to
all
to
become
able
technicalists
again
some
become
very
proficient
from
the
technical
standpoint
but
are
barren
soulless
uninspired
and
vapid
when
it
comes
to
the
artistic
and
musicianly
interpretation
of
a
piece
there
comes
a
time
to
every
advanced
pianist
when
such
exercises
as
the
scales
arpeggios
the
studies
of
czerny
and
cramer
are
unnecessary
i
have
not
practiced
them
for
some
years
but
pray
do
not
think
that
i
attempt
to
go
without
exercises
these
exercises
i
make
by
selecting
difficult
parts
of
famous
pieces
and
practicing
them
over
and
over
i
find
the
concertos
of
hummel
particularly
valuable
in
this
connection
and
there
are
parts
of
some
of
the
beethoven
concertos
that
make
splendid
musical
exercises
that
i
can
practice
without
the
fatal
diminution
of
interest
which
makes
a
technical
exercise
valueless
study
abroad
in
the
matter
of
foreign
study
i
think
that
i
may
speak
without
bias
as
i
am
engaged
in
teaching
and
am
not
likely
to
resume
for
some
years
i
am
that
there
are
many
teachers
in
america
who
are
as
good
as
the
best
in
europe
nevertheless
i
would
advise
the
young
american
to
secure
the
best
instruction
possible
in
his
native
land
and
then
to
go
abroad
for
a
further
course
it
will
serve
to
broaden
him
in
many
ways
i
believe
in
patriotism
and
i
admire
the
man
who
sticks
to
his
fatherland
but
in
art
there
is
no
such
thing
as
patriotism
as
the
conservatory
of
paris
provides
through
the
prix
de
rome
for
a
three
years
residence
in
italy
and
other
countries
for
the
most
promising
pupil
so
the
young
american
music
students
should
avail
themselves
of
the
advantages
of
old
world
civilization
art
and
music
there
is
much
to
be
learned
from
the
hustle
and
vigorous
wholesome
growth
of
your
own
country
that
would
be
of
decided
advantage
to
the
german
students
who
could
afford
a
term
of
residence
here
it
is
narrowing
to
think
that
one
should
avoid
the
old
world
art
centers
from
the
standpoint
of
american
patriotism
versatility
few
people
recognize
the
multifarious
requirements
of
the
concert
pianist
he
must
adjust
himself
to
all
sorts
of
halls
pianos
and
living
conditions
the
difference
between
one
piano
and
another
is
often
very
remarkable
it
sometimes
obliges
the
artist
to
readjust
his
technical
methods
very
materially
again
the
difference
in
halls
is
noteworthy
in
a
great
hall
like
the
albert
hall
of
london
one
can
only
strive
for
very
broad
effects
it
is
not
possible
for
one
to
attempt
the
delicate
shadings
which
the
smaller
halls
demand
much
is
lost
in
the
great
hall
and
it
is
often
unjust
to
determine
the
pianist
ability
by
his
exclusively
bravura
performances
in
very
large
auditoriums
cultivating
finger
strength
the
concert
pianist
must
have
great
endurance
his
fingers
must
be
as
strong
as
steel
and
yet
they
must
be
as
elastic
and
as
supple
as
willow
wands
i
have
always
had
great
faith
in
the
kleine
pischna
and
the
pischna
exercises
in
cultivating
strength
these
exercises
are
now
world
famous
and
it
would
be
hard
for
me
to
imagine
anything
better
for
this
particular
purpose
they
are
somewhat
voluminous
but
necessarily
so
one
conspicuous
difficulty
with
which
teachers
have
to
contend
is
that
pupils
attempt
pieces
requiring
great
digital
strength
without
ever
having
gone
through
such
a
course
as
i
advocate
above
the
result
is
that
they
have
all
sorts
of
troubles
with
their
hands
through
strain
some
of
these
troubles
are
irremediable
others
are
curable
but
cause
annoying
delays
i
have
never
had
anything
of
this
sort
and
attribute
my
immunity
from
weeping
sinews
to
correct
hand
positions
a
loose
wrist
and
slow
systematic
work
in
my
youth
velocity
velocity
depends
more
upon
natural
elasticity
than
strength
some
people
seem
to
be
born
with
the
ability
to
play
rapidly
it
is
always
a
matter
of
the
fingers
but
is
more
a
matter
of
the
brain
some
people
have
the
ability
to
think
very
rapidly
and
when
these
people
have
good
supple
hands
they
seem
to
be
able
to
play
rapidly
with
comparatively
little
study
when
you
fail
to
get
velocity
at
first
do
not
hesitate
to
lay
the
piece
aside
for
several
weeks
months
or
years
then
you
will
doubtless
find
that
the
matter
of
velocity
will
not
trouble
you
too
much
study
upon
a
piece
that
fails
for
the
time
being
to
respond
to
earnest
effort
is
often
a
bad
thing
be
a
little
patient
it
will
all
come
out
right
in
the
end
if
you
fuss
and
fume
for
immediate
results
you
may
be
sadly
disappointed
talent
talent
is
great
and
immutable
take
the
case
of
liszt
for
instance
i
recently
heard
from
a
reliable
source
the
following
interesting
story
one
day
liszt
was
called
away
from
his
class
at
wiemar
by
an
invitation
to
visit
the
grand
duke
von
bülow
then
a
mature
artist
was
present
and
he
was
asked
by
liszt
to
teach
the
class
for
the
day
liszt
left
the
room
and
a
young
student
was
asked
to
play
one
of
liszt
own
compositions
von
bülow
did
not
like
the
youth
interpretation
as
he
had
been
accustomed
to
play
the
same
work
on
tour
in
a
very
different
manner
consequently
he
abused
the
student
roundly
and
then
sat
at
the
keyboard
and
was
playing
to
his
great
satisfaction
when
the
tottering
old
master
broke
in
the
room
and
with
equal
severity
reprimanded
von
bülow
and
sat
down
at
the
keyboard
and
gave
an
interpretation
that
was
infinitely
superior
to
that
of
von
bülow
it
was
simply
a
case
of
superiority
of
talent
that
enabled
the
aged
and
somewhat
infirm
liszt
to
excel
his
younger
contemporary
be
natural
in
closing
let
me
enjoin
all
young
american
music
students
to
strive
for
naturalness
avoid
ostentatious
movements
in
your
playing
let
your
playing
be
as
quiet
as
possible
the
wrist
should
be
loose
the
hands
to
my
mind
should
be
neither
high
nor
low
but
should
be
in
line
with
the
forearm
one
should
continually
strive
for
quietness
nothing
should
be
forced
ease
in
playing
is
always
admirable
and
comes
in
time
to
all
talented
students
who
seek
it
the
deppe
method
of
hand
position
while
pedantic
and
unnecessarily
long
is
interesting
and
instructive
personally
i
advocate
the
use
of
the
etudes
of
chopin
moscheles
and
the
to
all
advanced
pupils
i
have
used
them
with
pupils
with
invariable
success
i
have
also
a
series
of
thirteen
etudes
of
my
own
that
i
have
made
for
the
express
purpose
of
affording
pupils
material
for
work
which
is
not
adequately
covered
in
the
usual
course
young
americans
have
a
great
future
before
them
the
pupils
i
have
had
have
invariably
been
ones
who
progress
with
astonishing
rapidity
they
show
keenness
and
good
taste
and
are
willing
to
work
faithfully
and
conscientiously
and
that
after
all
is
the
true
road
to
success
talent
counts
if
you
think
that
talent
does
not
count
you
are
very
greatly
mistaken
we
not
infrequently
see
men
who
have
been
engaged
in
one
occupation
with
only
very
moderate
success
suddenly
leap
into
fame
in
an
entirely
different
line
men
who
have
struggled
to
be
great
artists
or
illustrators
like
du
maurier
astonish
the
world
with
a
previously
concealed
literary
ability
it
is
foolish
not
to
recognize
the
part
that
talent
must
play
in
the
careers
of
artists
sometimes
hard
work
and
patient
persistence
will
stimulate
the
mind
and
soul
and
reveal
talents
that
were
never
supposed
to
exist
but
if
the
talent
does
not
exist
it
is
as
hopeless
to
hunt
for
it
as
it
is
to
seek
for
diamonds
in
a
bowl
of
porridge
talented
people
seem
to
be
born
with
the
knack
or
ability
to
do
certain
things
twice
as
well
and
twice
as
quickly
as
other
people
can
do
the
same
things
i
well

that
when
all
europe
was
wild
over

my
little

commenced
to
play

and
the

it
looked
interesting
and
i
thought
that
i
would
try
it
a
few
times
and
then
show
her
how
to
do
it
the
more
i
tried
the
more
exasperated
i
became
i
simply
could
not
make
it
go
and
before
i
knew
it
i
had
wasted
a
whole
morning
upon
it
my
little
daughter
took
it
up
and
in
a
few
minutes
practice
she
was
able
to
do
it
as
well
as
an
expert
it
is
precisely
the
same
at
the
keyboard
what
takes
some
pupils
hours
to
accomplish

can
do
in

few
seconds
with
apparently
less
effort
the
age
of
the
pupil
seems
to
have
little
to
do
with

comprehension
what
does
count
is
talent

peculiar
qualification
which
seems
to
lead
the

to

through

from
which
he
graduated
in
shortly
thereafter
he
was
appointed
a
teacher
in
the
same
institution
the
next
year
he
made
his
début
as
a
virtuoso
at
the
for
many
years
thereafter
he
gave
regular
concerts
in
berlin
in
connection
with
sauret
and
grünfeld
in
he
gave
up
his
position
in
the
famous
berlin
music
school
and
commenced
the
career
of
the
touring
virtuoso
in
he
founded
the
scharwenka
conservatory
in
berlin
together
with
his
brother
philipp
scharwenka
an
able
composer
in
scharwenka
came
to
new

to
establish
a
conservatory
there
this
however
was
closed
in
when
scharwenka
returned
to
berlin
as
director
of
the
conservatory
he
has
been
the
recipient
of
numerous
honors
from
the
governments
of
austria
and
germany
he
received
the
title
of
professor
from
the
king
of

ii
and
that
of
court
pianist
from
the
emperor
of

his
many
concert
tours
in
america
and
in
europe
have
established
his
fame
as
a
pianist
of
great
intellectual
strength
as
well
as
strong
poetical
force
his
compositions
including
his
four
concertos
have
been
widely
played
and
his
opera
has
received
important
productions
one
of
his
earlier
works

been
enormously

economy
in
music
study
xaver
scharwenka
it
is
somewhat
of
a
question
whether
any
time
spent
in
music
study
is
actually
wasted
since
all
intellectual
activity
is
necessarily
accompanied
by
an
intellectual
advance
however
it
soon
becomes
apparent
to
the
young
teacher
that
results
can
be
achieved
with
a
great
economy
of
time
if
the
right
methods
are
used
by
the
use
of
the
words
right
methods
i
do
not
mean
to
infer
that
only
one
right
method
exists
the
right
method
for
one
pupil
might
be
quite
different
from
that
which
would
bring
about
the
best
results
with
another
pupil
in
these
days
far
more
elasticity
of
methods
exists
than
was
generally
sanctioned
in
the
past
and
the
greatness
of
the
teacher
consists
very
largely
of
his
ability
to
invent
adapt
and
adjust
his
pedagogical
means
to
the
special
requirements
of
his
pupil
thus
it
happens
that
the
teacher
by
selecting
only
those
exercises
etudes
and
teaching
pieces
demanded
by
the
obvious
needs
of
the
pupil
and
by
eliminating
unnecessary
material
a
much
more
rapid
rate
of
advancement
may
be
obtained
one
pupil
for
instance
might
lack
those
qualities
of
velocity
and
dexterity
which
many
of
the
etudes
of
czerny
develop
in
such
an
admirable
manner
while
another
pupil
might
be
deficient
in
the
singing
tone
which
is
almost
invariably
improved
by
the
study
of
certain
chopin
etudes
time
lost
in
early
study
although
my
educational
work
for
many
years
has
been
almost
exclusively
limited
to
pupils
preparing
for
careers
as
teachers
and
as
concert
pianists
i
nevertheless
have
naturally
taken
a
great
interest
in
those
broad
and
significant
problems
which
underlie
the
elementary
training
of
the
young
music
student
i
have
written
quite
extensively
upon
the
subject
and
my
ideas
have
been
quite
definitely
expressed
in
my
book
des
klavierspiels
systematische
darstellung
der
technischen
und
æsthetischen
erfordernisse
für
einen
rationellen
i
have
also
come
in
close
contact
with
this
branch
of
musical
work
in
the
conservatory
in
berlin
my
observations
have
led
to
the
firm
conviction
that
much
of
the
time
lost
in
music
study
could
be
saved
if
the
elementary
training
of
the
pupil
were
made
more
comprehensive
and
more
secure
it
is
by
no
means
an
economy
of
time
to
hurry
over
the
foundation
work
of
the
pupil
it
is
also
by
no
means
an
economy
of
money
to
place
the
beginner
in
the
hands
of
a
teacher
there
is
just
as
much
need
for
the
specialist
to
train
the
pupil
at
the
start
as
there
is
for
the
head
of
the
meisterschule
to
guide
the
budding
virtuoso
how
can
we
expect
the
pupil
to
make
rapid
progress
if
the
start
is
not
right
one
might
as
well
expect
a
automobile
to
win
a
race
the
equipment
at
the
beginning
must
be
of
the
kind
which
will
carry
the
pupil
through
his
entire
career
with
success
if
any
omissions
occur
they
must
be
made
up
later
on
and
the
difficulty
in
repairing
this
neglect
is
twice
as
great
as
it
would
have
been
had
the
student
received
the
proper
instruction
at
the
start
the
training
of
the
ear
is
of
great
importance
and
if
teachers
would
only
make
sure
that
their
pupils
studied
music
with
their
sense
of
hearing
as
well
as
with
their
fingers
much
time
would
be
saved
in
later
work
young
pupils
should
be
taught
to
listen
by
permitting
them
to
hear
good
music
which
is
at
the
same
time
sufficiently
simple
to
insure
comprehension
early
musical
education
is
altogether
too
the
child
is
taken
to
the
piano
and
a
peculiar
set
of
hieroglyphics
known
as
notation
is
displayed
to
him
he
is
given
a
few
weeks
to
comprehend
that
these
signs
refer
to
certain
keys
on
the
keyboard
he
commences
to
push
down
these
keys
faithfully
and
patiently
and
his
musical
education
is
thus
launched
in
what
many
consider
the
approved
manner
nothing
is
said
about
the
meaning
of
the
piece
its
rhythm
its
harmonies
its
æsthetic
beauties
nothing
is
told
of
the
composer
or
of
the
period
in
which
the
piece
was
written
it
would
be
just
about
as
sensible
to
teach
a
pupil
to
repeat
the
sounds
of
the
chinese
language
by
reading
the
chinese
but
without
comprehending
the
meaning
of
the
sounds
and
signs
is
it
any
wonder
that
beginners
lose
interest
in
their
work
and
refuse
to
practise
except
when
compelled
to
do
so
i
am
most
emphatically
in
favor
of
a
more
rational
a
more
broad
and
a
more
thorough
training
of
the
beginner
time
taken
from
that
ordinarily
given
to
the
senseless
brainless
working
up
and
down
of
the
fingers
at
the
keyboard
and
devoted
to
those
studies
such
as
harmony
musical
history
form
and
in
fact
any
study
which
will
tend
to
widen
the
pupil
knowledge
and
increase
his
interest
will
save
much
time
in
later
work
waste
in
technical
study
geometrically
speaking
the
shortest
distance
between
two
points
is
a
straight
line
teachers
should
make
every
possible
effort
to
find
the
straight
line
of
technic
which
will
carry
the
pupil
from
his
first
steps
to
technical
proficiency
without
wandering
about
through
endless
lanes
and
avenues
which
lead
to
no
particular
end
i
suppose
that
all
american
teachers
hear
the
same
complaint
that
is
heard
by
all
european
teachers
when
any
attempt
is
made
to
insist
upon
thorough
practice
and
adequate
study
from
the
as
soon
as
the
teacher
demands
certain
indispensable
technical
studies
certain
necessary
investigations
of
the
harmonic
æsthetic
or
historical
problems
which
contribute
so
much
to
the
excellence
of
pianistic
interpretations
he
hears
the
following
complaint
i
do
want
to
be
a
composer
or
i
do
want
to
be
a
virtuoso
i
only
want
to
play
just
a
little
for
my
own
amusement
the
teacher
knows
and
appreciates
the
pupil
attitude
exactly
and
while
he
realizes
that
his
reasoning
is
altogether
fatuous
it
seems
impossible
to
explain
to
the
amateur
that
unless
he
does
his
work
right
he
will
get
very
little
real
pleasure
or
amusement
out
of
it
the
whole
sum
and
substance
of
the
matter
is
that
a
certain
amount
of
technical
theoretical
and
historical
knowledge
must
be
acquired
to
make
the
musician
before
we
can
make
a
player
there
is
the
distinction
teachers
should
never
fail
to
remember
that
their
first
consideration
should
be
to
make
a
musician
all
unmusical
playing
is
insufferable
no
amount
of
technical
study
will
make
a
musician
and
all
technical
study
which
simply
aims
to
make
the
fingers
go
faster
or
play
complicated
rhythms
is
wasted
unless
there
is
the
foundation
and
culture
of
the
real
musician
behind
it
to
the
sincere
student
every
piece
presents
technical
problems
peculiar
to
itself
the
main
objection
to
all
technical
study
is
that
unless
the
pupil
is
vitally
interested
the
work
becomes
monotonous
the
student
should
constantly
strive
to
avoid
monotony
in
practicing
exercises
as
soon
as
the
exercises
become
dull
and
uninteresting
their
value
immediately
depreciates
the
only
way
to
avoid
this
is
to
seek
variety
as
i
have
said
in
my
des
the
musical
and
tonal
monotony
of
technical
exercises
may
be
lessened
in
a
measure
by
progressive
modulations
by
various
rhythmical
alterations
and
further
through
frequent
changes
in
contrary
motion
great
stress
should
be
laid
upon
practice
in
contrary
motion
the
reason
for
this
is
obvious
to
all
students
of
harmony
when
playing
in
contrary
motion
all
unevenness
all
breaks
in
precision
and
all
unbalanced
conditions
of
touch
become
much
more
evident
to
the
ear
than
if
the
same
exercises
were
played
in
parallel
motion
another
important
reason
for
the
helpfulness
of
playing
in
contrary
motion
is
not
to
be
undervalued
it
is
that
a
kind
of
physical
is
developed
between
the
fingers
and
the
nerves
which
operate
them
in
the
corresponding
hands
for
instance
it
is
much
easier
to
play
with
the
fifth
finger
of
one
hand
and
the
fifth
finger
of
the
other
hand
than
it
is
to
play
with
the
third
finger
of
one
hand
and
the
fifth
finger
of
another
waste
in
unimportant
subjects
there
is
a
general
impression
among
teachers
that
much
time
might
be
saved
by
a
more
careful
selection
of
studies
and
by
a
better
adaptation
of
the
studies
to
particular
pupils
for
instance
carl
czerny
wrote
over
one
thousand
opus
numbers
he
wrote
some
of
the
most
valuable
studies
ever
written
but
no
one
would
think
of
demanding
a
pupil
to
play
all
of
the
czerny
studies
any
more
than
the
student
should
be
compelled
to
play
everything
that
loeschhorn
cramer
and
clementi
ever
wrote
studies
must
be
selected
with
great
care
and
adapted
to
particular
cases
and
if
the
young
teacher
feels
himself
incapable
of
doing
this
he
should
either
use
selections
or
collections
of
studies
edited
by
able
authorities
or
he
should
place
himself
under
the
advice
of
some
mature
and
experienced
teacher
until
the
right
experience
has
been
obtained
it
would
not
be
a
bad
plan
to
demand
that
all
young
teachers
be
apprenticed
to
an
older
teacher
until
the
right
amount
of
experience
has
been
obtained
the
completion
of
a
course
in
music
does
not
imply
that
the
student
is
able
to
teach
teaching
and
the
matter
of
musical
proficiency
are
two
very
different
things
many
conservatories
now
conduct
classes
for
teachers
which
are
excellent
in
their
way
in
the
olden
days
a
mechanic
had
to
work
side
by
side
with
his
master
before
he
was
considered
proficient
to
do
his
work
by
himself
how
much
more
important
is
it
that
our
educators
should
be
competently
trained
they
do
not
have
to
deal
with
machinery
but
they
do
have
to
deal
with
the
most
wonderful
of
all
machines
the
human
brain
some
studies
in
use
by
teachers
are
undeserving
of
their
popularity
according
to
my
way
of
thinking
some
studies
are
altogether
trivial
and
quite
dispensable
i
have
never
held
any
particular
fondness
for
heller
for
instance
his
studies
are
tuneful
but
they
seem
to
me
in
many
cases
weak
imitations
of
the
style
of
some
masters
such
as
schumann
mendelssohn
who
may
be
studied
with
more
profit
i
believe
that
the
studies
of
loeschhorn
possess
great
pedagogical
value
loeschhorn
was
a
born
teacher
he
knew
how
to
collect
and
present
technical
difficulties
in
a
manner
designed
to
be
of
real
assistance
to
the
student
the
studies
of
kullak
are
also
extremely
fine
this
is
a
subject
which
is
far
more
significant
than
it
may
at
first
appear
whatever
the
student
may
choose
to
study
after
he
leaves
the
teacher
his
work
while
under
the
teacher
direction
should
be
focused
upon
just
those
pieces
which
will
be
of
most
value
to
him
the
teacher
should
see
that
the
course
he
prescribes
is
unified
there
should
be
no
waste
material
some
teachers
are
inclined
to
teach
pieces
of
a
worthless
order
to
gain
the
fickle
interest
of
some
pupils
they
feel
that
it
is
better
to
teach
an
operatic
arrangement
no
matter
how
superficial
and
retain
the
interest
of
the
pupil
than
to
insist
upon
what
they
know
is
really
best
for
the
pupil
and
run
the
risk
of
having
the
pupil
go
to
another
teacher
less
conscientious
about
making
compromises
of
this
sort
when
the
teacher
has
come
to
a
position
where
he
is
obliged
to
permit
the
pupil
to
select
his
own
pieces
or
dictate
the
kind
of
pieces
he
is
to
be
taught
in
order
to
retain
his
interest
the
teacher
will
find
that
he
has
very
little
influence
over
the
pupil
pupils
who
insist
upon
mapping
out
their
own
careers
are
always
it
is
far
better
to
make
it
very
clear
to
the
pupil
in
the
first
place
that
interference
of
this
kind
is
never
desirable
and
that
unless
the
pupil
has
implicit
confidence
in
the
judgment
it
is
better
to
discontinue
brain
technic
versus
finger
technic
few
pupils
realize
that
hours
and
hours
are
wasted
at
the
piano
keyboard
doing
those
things
which
we
are
already
able
to
do
and
in
the
quest
of
something
which
we
already
possess
when
we
come
to
think
of
it
every
one
is
born
with
a
kind
of
finger
dexterity
any
one
can
move
the
fingers
up
and
down
with
great
rapidity
no
study
of
the
pianoforte
keyboard
is
necessary
to
do
this
the
savage
in
the
african
wilds
is
gifted
with
that
kind
of
dexterity
although
he
may
never
have
seen
a
pianoforte
then
why
spend
hours
in
practicing
at
the
keyboard
with
the
view
of
doing
something
we
can
already
do
it
may
come
as
a
surprise
to
many
when
i
make
the
statement
that
they
already
possess
a
kind
of
dexterity
and
velocity
which
they
may
not
suspect
one
does
not
have
to
work
for
years
to
make
the
fingers
go
up
and
down
quickly
it
is
also
a
fact
that
a
few
lessons
under
a
really
good
teacher
and
a
few
tickets
for
piano
recitals
will
often
give
the
feeling
and
knack
of
producing
a
good
touch
for
which
many
strive
in
vain
for
years
at
the
keyboard
no
the
technic
which
takes
time
is
the
technic
of
the
brain
which
directs
the
fingers
to
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
this
may
be
made
the
greatest
source
of
musical
economy
if
you
want
to
save
time
in
your
music
study
see
that
you
comprehend
your
musical
problems
thoroughly
you
must
see
it
right
in
your
mind
you
must
hear
it
right
you
must
feel
it
right
before
you
place
your
fingers
on
the
keyboard
you
should
have
formed
your
ideal
mental
conception
of
the
proper
rhythm
the
proper
tonal
quality
the
æsthetic
values
and
the
harmonic
content
these
things
can
only
be
perfectly
comprehended
after
study
they
do
not
come
from
strumming
at
the
keyboard
this
after
all
is
the
greatest
possible
means
for
saving
time
in
music
study
a
great
deal
might
be
said
upon
the
subject
of
the
teacher
part
in
saving
time
the
good
teacher
is
a
keen
critic
his
experience
and
his
innate
ability
enable
him
to
diagnose
faults
just
as
a
trained
medical
specialist
can
determine
the
cause
of
a
disease
with
accuracy
and
rapidity
much
depends
upon
the
diagnosis
it
is
no
saving
to
go
to
a
doctor
who
diagnoses
your
case
as
one
of
rheumatism
and
treats
you
for
rheumatic
pains
whereas
you
are
really
suffering
from
neurasthenia
in
a
similar
manner
an
unskilled
and
incompetent
teacher
may
waste
much
treasured
time
in
treating
you
for
technical
and
musical
deficiencies
entirely
different
from
those
which
you
really
suffer
great
care
should
be
taken
in
selecting
a
teacher
for
with
the
wrong
teacher
not
only
time
is
wasted
but
talent
energy
and
sometimes
that
jewel
in
the
crown
of
success
ambition
a
case
in
point
an
illustration
of
one
means
of
wasting
time
is
well
indicated
in
the
case
of
some
pedagogs
who
hold
to
old
ideas
in
simply
because
they
are
old
i
believe
in
conservatism
but
at
the
same
time
i
am
opposed
to
conservatism
which
excludes
all
progressiveness
the
world
is
continually
advancing
and
we
are
continually
finding
out
new
things
as
well
as
determining
which
of
the
older
methods
will
prove
the
best
in
the
long
run
all
musical
europe
has
been
upset
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
century
over
the
vital
subject
of
whether
the
pressure
touch
is
better
than
the
angular
blow
touch
there
was
a
time
in
the
past
when
an
apparent
effort
was
made
to
make
everything
pertaining
to
pianoforte
technic
as
stiff
and
inelastic
as
possible
the
fingers
were
trained
to
hop
up
and
down
like
little
hammers
the
arm
was
held
stiff
and
hard
at
the
side
in
fact
it
was
not
uncommon
for
some
teachers
to
put
a
book
under
the
armpit
and
insist
upon
their
pupils
holding
it
there
by
pressing
against
the
body
during
the
practice
period
ehrlich
who
in
his
day
was
a
widely
recognized
authority
wrote
a
pamphlet
to
accompany
his
edition
of
the
tausig
technical
studies
in
which
this
system
is
very
clearly
outlined
he
asserts
that
tausig
insisted
upon
it
we
witness
a
great
revolution
the
arms
are
held
freely
and
rigidity
of
all
kind
is
avoided
it
was
found
that
the
entire
system
of
touch
was
under
a
more
delicate
and
sensitive
control
when
the
pressure
touch
was
employed
than
when
the
mechanical
hitting
touch
was
used
it
was
also
found
that
much
of
the
time
spent
in
developing
the
hitting
touch
along
mechanical
lines
was
wasted
since
superior
results
could
be
achieved
in
a
shorter
time
by
means
of
pressing
and
kneading
the
keys
rather
than
delivering
blows
to
them
the
pressure
touch
seems
to
me
very
much
freer
and
i
am
emphatically
in
favor
of
it
the
older
method
produced
cramped
unmusical
playing
and
the
pupil
was
so
restricted
that
he
reminded
one
for
all
the
world
of
the
skirts
which
seem
to
give
our
ladies
of
fashion
so
much
difficulty
just
now
the
american
pupils
who
have
come
to
germany
to
study
with
me
have
been
for
the
most
part
exceedingly
well
trained
in
america
there
are
innumerable
excellent
teachers
the
american
pupil
is
almost
always
very
industrious
his
chief
point
of
vantage
is
his
ability
to
concentrate
he
does
not
dissipate
his
time
or
thought
in
some
instances
he
can
only
remain
in
europe
for
two
years
sometimes
less
he
quite
naturally
feels
that
a
great
deal
must
be
done
in
those
two
years
and
consequently
he
works
at
white
heat
this
is
not
a
disadvantage
for
his
mental
powers
are
intensified
and
he
is
faithful
to
his
labor
the
young
women
of
america
are
for
the
most
part
very
this
is
also
very
much
to
their
advantage
as
a
rule
they
know
how
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
yet
they
have
the
courage
to
venture
and
ask
questions
when
questions
should
be
asked
my
residence
in
america
has
brought
me
many
good
friends
and
it
is
a
pleasure
to
note
the
great
advance
made
in
every
way
since
my
last
visit
here
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
have
some
of
my
later
compositions
become
better
known
in
america
as
i
have
great
faith
in
the
musical
future
of
the
country
i
wish
that
they
might
become
familiar
with
such
works
as

i
should
deeply
regret
to
think
that
americans
would
judge
my
work
as
a

ernest
schelling
was
born
at
belvidere
new
jersey
his
first
musical
training
was
received
from
his
father
at
the
age
of
four
and
years
he
made
his
début
at
the
philadelphia
academy
of
music
at
the
age
of
seven
he
entered
the
paris
conservatoire
with
the
famous
chopin
pupil
georges
mathias
as
his
teacher
he
remained
with
mathias
for
two
years
however
he
commenced
giving
concerts
which
took
him
to
france
england
and
austria
when
he
was
only
eight
years
old
at
ten
he
was
taken
to
stuttgart
and
placed
under
the
educational
guidance
of
pruckner
and
the
american
teacher
percy
götschius
who
attained
wide
fame
abroad
shortly
thereafter
he
was
placed
for
a
short
time
under
the
instruction
of
leschetizky
but
this
was
interrupted
by
tours
through
russia
and
other
countries
at
twelve
he
was
taken
to
basle
switzerland
and
hans
huber
undertook
to
continue
his
already
much
varied
training
here
his
general
education
received
the
attention
which
had
been
much
neglected
at

learning
a
new
piece
ernest
schelling
preliminary
study
in
studying
a
new
musical
composition
experience
has
revealed
to
me
that
the
student
can
save
much
time
and
get
a
better
general
idea
of
the
composition
by
reading
it
over
several
times
before
going
to
the
instrument
while
this
is
difficult
for
very
young
pupils
to
do
before
they
have
become
accustomed
to
mentally
interpreting
the
notes
into
sounds
without
the
assistance
of
the
instrument
it
is
nevertheless
of
advantage
from
the
very
start
it
saves
the
pupil
from
much
unprofitable
blundering
to
take
a
piece
right
to
the
keyboard
without
any
preliminary
consideration
may
perhaps
be
good
practice
for
those
who
would
cultivate
ready
sight
reading
but
it
should
be
remembered
that
even
the
most
apt
sight
readers
will
usually
take
the
precaution
of
looking
a
new
piece
through
at
least
once
to
place
themselves
on
guard
for
the
more
difficult
or
more
complicated
passages
by
forming
the
habit
of
reading
away
from
the
piano
the
pupil
soon
becomes
able
to
hear
the
music
without
making
the
sounds
at
the
keyboard
and
this
leads
to
a
mental
conception
of
the
piece
as
a
whole
which
invariably
produces
surprisingly
good
results
the
technical
demands
of
the
piece
the
next
consideration
should
be
the
execution
of
the
right
notes
a
careless
reading
often
leads
the
pupil
to
play
notes
quite
different
from
those
actually
in
the
piece
it
is
astonishing
how
often
some
pupils
are
deceived
in
this
matter
until
you
have
insured
absolute
accuracy
in
the
matter
of
the
notes
you
are
not
in
condition
to
regard
the
other
details
the
failure
to
repeat
an
accidental
chromatic
alteration
in
the
same
bar
the
neglect
of
a
tie
or
an
enharmonic
interval
with
a
tie
are
all
common
faults
which
mark
careless
performances
after
the
piece
has
been
read
as
a
whole
and
you
have
determined
upon
the
notes
so
that
there
is
no
opportunity
for
inaccuracy
from
that
source
you
will
find
that
the
best
way
to
proceed
is
to
take
a
very
small
passage
and
study
that
passage
first
for
the
inexperienced
student
i
should
suggest
two
measures
or
a
phrase
of
similar
length
do
not
leave
these
two
measures
until
you
are
convinced
that
you
have
mastered
them
this
will
take
a
great
amount
of
concentration
many
pupils
fail
because
they
underestimate
the
amount
of
concentration
required
they
expect
results
to
come
without
effort
and
are
invariably
disappointed
after
the
first
two
measures
have
been
mastered
take
the
next
two
measures
and
learn
these
thoroughly
then
go
back
and
learn
measures
two
and
three
so
that
there
may
be
no
possibility
of
a
break
or
interruption
between
them
next
proceed
in
the
same
way
with
the
following
four
measures
and
do
not
stop
until
you
have
completed
the
piece
this
kind
of
study
may
take
more
time
than
the
methods
to
which
you
have
become
accustomed
but
it
is
by
all
means
the
most
thorough
and
the
most
satisfactory
i
found
it
indispensable
in
the
preparation
of
pieces
for
public
performances
it
demands
the
closest
kind
of
study
and
this
leads
to
artistic
results
and
a
higher
perception
of
the
musical
values
of
the
composition
being
studied
take
for
instance
the
c
major
fantasie
of
schumann
one
of
the
most
beautiful
and
yet
one
of
the
most
difficult
of
all
compositions
to
interpret
properly
at
first
the
whole
work
seems
disunited
and
if
studied
carelessly
the
necessary
unity
which
should
mark
this
work
can
never
be
secured
but
if
studied
with
minute
regard
for
details
after
the
manner
in
which
i
have
suggested
the
whole
composition
becomes
wonderfully
compact
and
every
part
is
linked
to
the
other
parts
so
that
a
beautiful
unity
must
result
formal
divisions
many
works
have
formal
divisions
such
as
those
of
the
sonata
the
suite
etc
even
the
liszt
have
movements
of
marked
differences
in
tempo
and
style
here
the
secret
is
to
study
each
division
in
its
relation
to
the
whole
there
must
be
an
internal
harmony
between
all
the
parts
otherwise
the
interpretation
will
mar
the
great
masterpiece
the
difficulty
is
to
find
the
bearing
of
one
movement
upon
another
even
the
themes
of
subjects
of
the
conventional
sonata
have
a
definite
interrelation
how
to
interpret
these
themes
and
yet
at
the
same
time
produce
contrast
and
unity
is
difficult
it
is
this
difference
of
interpretation
that
adds
charm
to
the
piano
recitals
of
different
virtuosos
there
is
no
one
right
way
and
no
one
best
way
but
rather
an
indefinite
margin
for
personal
opinion
and
the
exhibition
of
artistic
taste
if
there
was
one
best
way
there
are
now
machines
which
could
record
that
way
and
there
the
whole
matter
would
end
but
we
want
to
hear
all
the
ways
and
consequently
we
go
to
the
recitals
of
different
pianists
how
can
i
express
more
emphatically
the
necessity
for
the
pianist
being
a
man
of
culture
artistic
sensibilities
and
of
creative
tendencies
the
student
must
be
taught
to
think
about
his
interpretations
and
if
this
point
is
missed
and
he
is
permitted
to
give
conventional
uninspired
performances
he
need
never
hope
to
play
artistically
the
touch
required
in
studying
a
new
piece
as
soon
as
the
style
of
the
piece
has
been
determined
and
the
accuracy
of
the
notes
secured
the
pupil
should
consider
the
matter
to
touch
he
should
have
been
previously
instructed
in
the
principles
of
the
different
kinds
of
touch
used
in
pianoforte
playing
i
am
a
firm
believer
in
associating
the
appropriate
kind
of
touch
with
the
passage
studied
from
the
very
beginning
if
the
passage
calls
for
a
staccato
touch
do
not
waste
your
time
as
many
do
by
practicing
it
legato
again
in
a
cantabile
passage
do
not
make
the
mistake
of
using
a
touch
that
would
produce
the
wrong
quality
of
tone
the
wrists
at
all
times
should
be
in
the
most
supple
possible
condition
there
should
never
be
any
constraint
at
that
point
when
i
resumed
my
musical
studies
with
paderewski
after
a
lapse
of
several
years
he
laid
greatest
emphasis
upon
this
point
i
feel
that
the
most
valuable
years
for
the
development
of
touch
and
tone
are
those
which
bind
the
natural
facility
of
the
child
hand
with
the
acquired
agility
of
the
adult
to
my
great
misfortune
i
was
not
able
to
practice
between
the
ages
of
twelve
and
eighteen
this
was
due
to
excessive
study
and
extensive
concert
tours
as
a
prodigy
these
wrecked
my
health
and
it
was
only
by
the
hardest
kind
of
practice
in
after
life
that
i
was
able
to
regain
the
natural
facility
that
had
marked
my
playing
in
childhood
in
fact
i
owe
everything
to
the
kind
persistence
and
wonderful
inspiration
of
paderewski
the
right
tempo
the
right
tempo
is
a
very
important
matter
for
the
student
first
of
all
he
must
be
absolutely
positive
that
his
time
is
correct
there
is
nothing
so
barbarous
in
all
as
a
bad
conception
of
time
even
the
inexperienced
and
unmusical
listener
detects
bad
time
the
student
should
consider
this
matter
one
of
greatest
importance
and
demand
perfect
time
from
himself
with
some
students
this
can
only
be
cultivated
after
much
painful
effort
the
metronome
is
of
assistance
as
is
counting
but
these
are
not
enough
the
pupil
must
create
a
sense
of
time
he
must
have
a
sort
of
internal
metronome
which
he
must
feel
throbbing
within
all
the
time
always
begin
your
practice
slowly
and
gradually
advance
the
tempo
the
worst
possible
thing
is
to
start
practicing
too
fast
it
invariably
leads
to
bad
results
and
to
lengthy
delays
the
right
tempo
will
come
with
time
and
you
must
have
patience
until
you
can
develop
it
in
the
matter
of
rubato
passages
which
always
invite
disaster
upon
the
part
of
the
student
the
general
idea
is
that
the
right
hand
must
be
out
of
time
with
the
left
this
is
not
always
the
case
as
they
sometimes
play
in
unison
the
word
simply
implies
the
time
but
it
is
robbed
after
the
same
manner
in
which
one
peter
to
pay
paul
that
is
a
ritard
in
one
part
of
the
measure
must
be
compensated
for
by
an
acceleration
in
another
part
of
the
measure
if
the
right
hand
is
to
play
at
variance
with
the
left
hand
the
latter
remains
as
a
kind
of
anchor
upon
which
the
tempo
of
the
entire
measure
must
depend
chopin
called
the
left
hand
the
and
a
very
good
appellation
this
is
take
for
instance
his
flat
minor
in
the
latter
part
of
this
wonderful
composition
the
regular
rhythmic
repetition
in
octaves
in
the
bass
makes
a
rhythmic
foundation
which
the
most
erratic
and
nervous
right
hand
can
not
shake
rhythmic
peculiarities
rhythm
is
the
basis
of
everything
even
the
silent
mountain
boulders
are
but
the
monuments
of
some
terrible
rhythmic
convulsion
of
the
earth
in
past
ages
there
is
a
rhythm
in
the
humming
bird
and
there
is
a
rhythm
in
the
movements
of
a
giant
locomotive
we
are
all
rhythmic
in
our
speech
our
walk
and
in
our
life
more
or
less
how
important
then
is
the
study
of
the
rhythmic
peculiarities
of
the
new
piece
every
contributing
accent
which
gives
motion
and
characteristic
swing
to
the
piece
must
be
carefully
studied
it
is
rhythm
which
sways
the
audience
some
performers
are
so
gifted
with
the
ability
to
invest
their
interpretations
with
a
rhythmic
charm
that
they
seem
to
fairly
invigorate
their
audiences
with
the
spirit
of
motion
i
can
not
conceive
of
a
really
great
artist
without
this
sense
of
rhythm
the
composer
inspiration
personally
i
believe
in
music
that
is
music
in
the
field
of
pianoforte
composition
that
is
sufficient
unto
itself
and
which
does
not
require
any
of
the
other
arts
to
enhance
its
beauty
however
in
the
cases
of
some
of
our
modern
composers
who
have
professedly
drawn
their
musical
inspiration
from
tales
great
pictures
or
from
nature
i
can
see
the
desirability
of
investigating
these
sources
in
order
to
come
closer
to
the
composer
idea
some
of
the
works
of
debussy
demand
this
let
me
play
you
his
in
for
instance
the
work
is
most
subtle
and
requires
an
appreciation
of
oriental
life
and
is
indeed
a
kind
of
tonal
dream
picture
of
the
old
fortified
palace
of
moorish
spain
i
feel
that
in
cases
of
this
kind
it
helps
the
performer
to
have
in
mind
the
composer
conception
and
in
playing
this
piece
in
public
i
always
follow
this
plan
studying
the
phrasing
each
phrase
in
a
piece
requires
separate
study
i
believe
that
the
student
should
leave
nothing
undone
to
learn
how
to
phrase
or
rather
to
analyze
a
piece
so
that
all
its
constituent
phrases
become
clear
to
him
each
phrase
must
be
studied
with
the
same
deference
to
detail
that
the
singer
would
give
to
an
individual
phrase
this
is
by
no
means
an
easy
matter
more
important
still
is
the
interrelation
of
phrases
every
note
in
a
work
of
musical
art
bears
a
certain
relation
to
every
other
note
so
it
is
with
the
phrases
each
phrase
must
be
played
with
reference
to
the
work
as
a
whole
or
more
particularly
to
the
movement
of
which
it
is
a
part
marking
the
fingering
it
seems
hardly
necessary
to
say
anything
about
the
fingering
when
so
much
attention
is
being
given
to
the
matter
by
the
best
teachers
of
the
country
but
certainly
one
of
the
most
essential
considerations
in
the
study
of
a
new
piece
is
the
study
of
the
fingering
a
detailed
study
of
this
should
be
made
and
it
should
be
clearly
understood
that
the
fingering
should
be
adapted
to
fit
the
hand
of
the
player
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
to
accept
the
fingering
given
in
the
book
as
the
wise
student
will
try
many
fingerings
before
deciding
upon
the
one
that
suits
him
best
students
who
go
to
these
pains
are
the
ones
who
invariably
succeed
those
who
take
anything
that
is
presented
to
them
without
considering
its
advisability
rarely
attain
lofty
musical
heights
when
a
fingering
has
once
been
determined
upon
it
should
never
be
changed
to
change
a
fingering
frequently
means
to
waste
many
hours
of
practice
this
may
be
considered
a
mechanical
method
but
it
is
the
method
invariably
employed
by
successful
artists
why
simply
because
one
fingering
closely
adhered
to
establishes
finger
habits
which
give
freedom
and
certainty
and
permits
the
player
to
give
more
consideration
to
the
other
details
of
artistic
interpretation
i
ofttimes
find
it
expedient
to
adapt
a
more
difficult
fingering
of
some
given
passage
for
the
reason
that
the
difficult
fingering
frequently
leads
to
a
better
interpretation
of
the
composer
meaning
i
know
of
innumerable
passages
in
the
piano
classics
which
illustrate
this
point
moreover
a
fingering
that
seems
difficult
at
first
is
often
more
simple
than
the
conventional
or
arbitrary
fingering
employed
by
the
student
after
the
student
has
given
sufficient
time
to
the
new
fingering
the
required
accent
often
obliges
the
performer
to
employ
a
different
fingering
the
stronger
fingers
are
naturally
better
adapted
to
the
stronger
accents
otherwise
it
is
best
to
use
a
similar
fingering
for
similar
passages
memorizing
i
should
like
to
add
a
few
words
with
regard
to
committing
pieces
to
memory
there
are
three
ways
by
sight
that
is
seeing
the
notes
in
your
mind
eye

by
the
way
which
comes
to
one
most
naturally
memorizing
by
the
fingers
that
is
training
the
fingers
to
do
their
duty
no
matter
what
happens
before
performing
in
public
the
student
should
have
memorized
the
composition
in
all
of
these
ways
only
thus
can
he
be
absolutely
sure
of
himself
if
one
way
fails
him
the
other
method
comes
to
his
rescue
after
careful
attention
has
been
given
to
the
various
points
of
which
i
have
spoken
and
the
details
of
the
composition
satisfactorily
worked
out
the
student
should
practice
with
a
view
to
learning
the
piece
as
a
whole
nothing
is
so
distressing
to
the
musician
as
a
piece
which
does
not
seem
to
have
coherence
and
unity
it
should
be
regarded
aurally
as
the
artist
regards
his
work
visually
the
painter
stands
off
at
some
distance
to
look
at
his
work
in
order
to
see
whether
all
parts
of
his
painting
harmonize
the
pianist
must
do
much
the
same
thing
he
must
listen
to
his
work
time
and
time
again
and
if
it
does
not
seem
to
together
he
must
unify
all
the
parts
until
he
can
give
a
real
interpretation
instead
of
a
collection
of

sections
this

what
interpretation
really
is
sigismund
stojowski
the
composer
limitations
in
his
means
of
expression
it
is
difficult
for
some
people
who
are
not
versed
in
the
intricate
mysteries
of
the
art
of
music
to
realize
how
limited
are
the
means
afforded
the
composer
for
communicating
to
the
interpreter
some
slight
indication
of
the
ideal
he
had
in
mind
when
writing
the
composition
it
may
be
said
that
while
every
great
composer
feels
almost
at
the
moment
of
creation
the
merest
fraction
of
the
myriad
beauties
he
has
in
mind
ever
reach
human
ears
the
very
signs
with
which
the
composer
is
provided
to
help
him
put
his
thoughts
down
on
paper
are
in
themselves
inadequate
to
serve
as
a
means
of
recording
more
than
a
shadow
of
his
masterpiece
as
it
was
originally
conceived
of
course
we
are
speaking
now
in
a
large
sense
we
are
imagining
that
the
composer
is
a
beethoven
with
an
immortal
message
to
convey
to
posterity
of
all
composers
beethoven
was
perhaps
the
one
to
employ
the
most
perfect
means
of
expression
his
works
represent
a
completeness
a
poise
and
a
masterly
finish
which
will
serve
as
a
model
for
all
time
to
come
it
must
also
be
noted
that
few
composers
have
employed
more
accurate
marks
of
expression
such
as
time
marks
dynamic
marks
etc
in
all
these
things
beethoven
was
obliged
to
adhere
to
the
conventions
adopted
by
others
for
this
purpose
of
attempting
to
make
the
meaning
clearer
to
other
minds
these
conventions
like
all
conventions
are
partly
insufficient
to
convey
the
full
idea
of
the
composer
and
partly
arbitrary
in
that
they
do
not
give
the
interpreter
adequate
latitude
to
introduce
his
own
ideas
in
expression
the
student
should
seek
to
break
the
veil
of
conventions
provided
by
notation
and
seek
a
clearer
insight
into
the
composer
individuality
as
expressed
in
his
compositions
from
this
point
of
view
the
subjective
interpretation
seems
the
only
legitimate
one
in
fact
the
ones
who
pretend
to
be
objective
in
the
sense
of
being
literal
and
playing
strictly
according
to
the
marks
of
expression
and
admitting
little
elasticity
in
the
interpretation
of
these
are
also
as
rubinstein
pointed
out
subjective
at
heart
this
may
be
more
concisely
expressed
thus
since
all
things
of
permanent
value
in
music
have
proceeded
from
a
fervid
artistic
imagination
they
should
be
interpreted
with
the
continual
employment
of
the
performer
imagination
on
the
other
hand
the
subjective
method
right
as
it
is
in
principle
can
become
of
course
according
to
the
italian
saying
that
is
an
absolute
treachery
to
the
composer
ideal
if
the
performer
understanding
and
execution
of
the
composition
is
not
based
upon
long
and
careful
investigation
of
all
the
fundamental
laws
and
associated
branches
of
musical
study
which
are
designed
to
give
him
a
basis
for
forming
his
own
opinions
upon
the
best
method
of
interpreting
the
composition
inadequate
training
in
this
respect
is
the
chinese
wall
which
surrounds
the
composer
hidden
meaning
this
wall
must
be
torn
down
brick
by
brick
stone
by
stone
in
a
manner
which
we
would
call
analytical
practice
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
the
student
may
gain
entrance
to
the
sacred
city
of
the
elect
to
whom
the
ideal
of
the
composer
has
been
revealed
the
interpreter
must
coöperate
with
the
composer
in
a
certain
sense
the
interpreter
is
a
coöperator
with
the
composer
or
more
definitely
expressed
he
is
the
continuer
along
the
line
of
the
musical
thought
and
its
adequate
expression
music
of
all
arts
is
the
unfinished
art
when
a
great
painting
is
completed
time
and
time
only
will
make
the
changes
in
its
surface
when
the
great
masterpieces
left
the
brushes
of
raphael
rubens
holbein
correggio
or
van
dyck
they
were
finished
works
of
art
when
bach
beethoven
chopin
and
brahms
put
their
thoughts
down
upon
paper
they
left
a
record
in
ink
and
paper
which
must
be
born
again
every
time
it
is
brought
to
the
minds
of
men
this
rebirth
is
the
very
essence
of
all
that
is
best
in
interpretative
skill
new
life
goes
into
the
composition
at
the
very
moment
it
passes
through
the
soul
of
the
master
performer
it
is
here
that
he
should
realize
the
great
truth
that
in
music
more
than
in
any
other
art
the
letter
kills
and
the
spirit
vivifies
the
interpreter
must
master
the
letter
and
seek
to
give
rebirth
to
the
spirit
if
he
can
do
this
he
will
attain
the
greatest
in
interpretative
ability
from
the
literal
or
objective
standpoint
then
an
insight
is
gained
into
the
nature
of
the
composer
masterpiece
by
close
and
careful
study
of
the
work
itself
by
gaining
a
knowledge
of
the
musical
laws
underlying
the
structure
and
composition
of
a
work
of
its
kind
as
well
as
the
necessary
keyboard
technic
to
give
expression
to
the
work
but
the
veil
is
torn
from
the
composer
hidden
meaning
only
becoming
intimate
with
his
creative
personality
as
a
master
by
studying
his
life
environments
by
investigating
the
historical
background
of
the
period
in
which
he
worked
by
learning
of
his
joys
and
his
sufferings
by
cultivating
a
deep
and
heartfelt
sympathy
for
his
ideals
and
by
the
scrupulous
and
constant
revision
of
one
own
ideals
and
conceptions
of
the
standards
by
which
his
masterpieces
should
be
judged
studying
the
historical
background
to
exemplify
what
i
mean
i
could
for
instance
refer
to
interpretations
of
liszt
and
chopin
during
the
time
i
was
associated
with
the
master
pianist
as
a
pupil
i
had
abundant
opportunities
to
make
notes
upon
the
very
individual
as
well
as
the
highly
artistically
differentiated
expressions
of
his
musical
judgment
it
was
interesting
to
observe
that
he
played
the
rhapsodies
with
various
extensions
and
modifications
the
result
of
which
is
the
glorification
of
liszt
own
spirit
on
the
contrary
in
order
to
preserve
chopin
spirit
the
master
would
always
repudiate
any
changes
like
those
of
tausig
for
instance
by
which
some
virtuosos
pretend
to
emphasize
or
modernize
chopin
personal
and
perfect
pianism
differences
in
treatment
are
the
outcome
of
deep
insight
as
well
as
the
study
of
the
time
and
conditions
under
which
the
work
was
produced
the
study
of
musical
history
reveals
many
very
significant
things
which
have
a
direct
bearing
not
only
upon
the
interpretation
of
the
performer
but
upon
the
degree
of
appreciation
with
which
the
listener
is
able
to
enjoy
a
musical
work
it
was
for
this
reason
that
i
prefaced
the
first
two
recitals
of
my
course
of
historical
recitals
given
at
mendelssohn
hall
new
york
during
the
past
season
with
a
lecture
upon
the
historical
conditions
which
surrounded
the
masters
at
the
time
the
compositions
were
composed
the
inadequacy
of
musical
signs
i
have
already
referred
to
the
inadequacy
of
musical
signs
even
the
mechanical
guide
the
metronome
is
not
always
to
be
depended
upon
to
give
the
exact
tempo
the
composer
had
in
mind
let
me
cite
a
little
instance
from
the
biography
of
ries
the
friend
of
beethoven
ries
was
preparing
to
conduct
a
performance
of
the
beethoven
ninth
symphony
he
requested
beethoven
to
make
notes
upon
paper
regarding
the
metronomic
marks
of
speed
at
which
the
composition
should
be
played
the
metronome
at
that
time
was
a
comparatively
new
instrument
maelzel
its
inventor
or
rather
its
improver
since
the
principle
of
the
metronome
was
of
dutch
origin
was
a
friend
of
beethoven
at
times
they
were
on
the
best
of
terms
and
at
other
times
they
were
literally
at
swords
points
nevertheless
maelzel
who
had
a
strong
personality
succeeded
in
inducing
beethoven
to
put
metronomic
markings
upon
several
of
his
compositions
naturally
the
metronome
was
immediately
accorded
an
important
place
in
the
musical
world
even
at
that
day
ries
was
consequently
very
anxious
to
give
the
choral
symphony
according
to
beethoven
own
ideas
beethoven
had
complied
with
the
desire
and
sent
a
slip
of
paper
with
the
tempi
marked
metronomically
this
slip
was
lost
ries
wrote
to
beethoven
for
a
duplicate
beethoven
sent
another
later
the
lost
slip
was
found
and
upon
comparing
it
with
the
second
slip
it
was
found
that
beethoven
had
made
an
entirely
different
estimate
of
the
tempi
at
which
he
desired
the
symphony
to
be
played
even
with
the
most
elaborate
and
complete
marks
of
expression
such
as
those
for
instance
employed
by
beethoven
and
by
wagner
the
composer
is
confronted
with
his
great
poverty
of
resources
to
present
his
views
to
the
mind
of
the
interpreter
extensive
as
some
of
the
modern
dictionaries
of
musical
terminology
seem
to
be
they
are
wholly
inadequate
from
the
standpoint
of
a
complete
vocabulary
to
give
full
expression
to
the
artist
imagination
it
also
gives
full
scope
to
an
infinite
variety
of
error
in
the
matter
of
the
shades
or
degrees
of
dynamic
force
at
which
the
conventional
marks
may
be
rendered
one
might
venture
to
remark
that
composers
are
the
most
keen
most
conscious
judges
of
their
own
works
or
rather
of
the
garments
which
fit
them
best
there
is
in
all
composition
a
divine
part
and
also
a
conscious
part
the
divine
part
is
the
inspiration
the
conscious
part
has
to
do
with
dressing
the
inspiration
in
its
most
appropriate
harmonic
polyphonic
and
rhythmic
garments
these
garments
are
the
raiment
in
which
the
inspiration
will
be
viewed
by
future
generations
it
is
often
by
these
garments
that
they
will
be
judged
if
the
garments
are
awkward
inappropriate
and
a
beautiful
interpretation
of
the
composer
ideal
will
be
impossible
nevertheless
it
is
the
performer
duty
in
each
case
to
try
to
see
through
even
unbecoming
garments
and
divine
the
composer
thought
according
to
the
interpreter
best
understanding
learning
the
musical
language
where
interpretation
is
concerned
one
is
too
often
inclined
to
forget
that
while
there
is
a
higher
part
the
secrets
of
which
are
accessible
only
to
the
elect
there
is
also
an
elementary
part
which
involves
the
knowledge
of
musical
grammar
and
beyond
that
the
correct
feeling
of
musical
declamation
since
music
after
all
is
a
language
which
is
at
all
times
perfectly
teachable
and
which
should
be
most
carefully
and
systematically
taught
i
consider
the
book
of
mathis
lussy
and
musical
of
great
value
to
the
student
in
search
of
truths
pertaining
to
intelligent
interpretation
lussy
was
a
swiss
who
was
born
in
the
early
part
of
the
last
century
he
went
to
paris
to
study
medicine
but
having
had
a
musical
training
in
the
country
of
his
birth
he
became
a
good
pianoforte
teacher
and
an
excellent
writer
upon
musical
subjects
while
teaching
in
a
young
ladies
school
he
was
confronted
with
the
great
paucity
of
real
knowledge
of
the
rudiments
of
expression
and
he
accordingly
prepared
a
book
upon
the
subject
which
has
since
been
translated
into
several
languages
this
book
is
most
helpful
and
i
advocate
its
use
frequently
it
should
be
in
the
hands
of
every
conscientious
piano
student
mistakes
peculiar
to
the
pianoforte
player
the
nature
of
the
keyboard
of
the
piano
and
the
ease
with
which
certain
things
are
accomplished
make
it
possible
for
the
performer
to
make
certain
errors
which
the
construction
of
other
instruments
would
prevent
the
pianist
is
for
instance
entirely
unlike
the
violinist
who
has
to
locate
his
keyboard
every
time
he
takes
up
his
instrument
and
moreover
locate
it
by
a
highly
trained
sense
of
position
in
a
certain
way
i
sometimes
feel
somewhat
ashamed
for
the
pianist
profession
when
i
hear
players
even
those
with
manifest
technical
proficiency
commit
flagrant
mistakes
against
elementary
rules
of
accentuation
and
phrasing
such
as
for
instance
an
average
violinist
acquainted
with
good
bowing
is
accordingly
prevented
from
making
upon
his
instrument
the
means
of
discovering
the
composer
hidden
meaning
are
in
fact
so
numerous
that
the
conscientious
interpreter
must
keep
upon
continuous
voyages
of
exploration
there
are
many
easily
recognizable
paths
leading
to
the
promised
land
one
is
the
path
of
harmony
without
an
understanding
of
which
the
performer
can
never
reach
his
goal
another

others
are
the
studies

pedaling
