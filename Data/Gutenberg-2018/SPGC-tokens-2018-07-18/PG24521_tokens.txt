are
times
when
a
broken
tool
is
better
than
a
sound
one
or
a
twisted
personality
more
useful
than

building
in
occeq
city
bertrand
malloy
leafed
casually
through
the
dossiers
of
the
four
new
men
who
had
been
assigned
to
him
they
were
typical
of
the
kind
of
men
who
were
sent
to
him
he
thought
which
meant
as
usual
that
they
were
atypical
every
man
in
the
diplomatic
corps
who
developed
a
twitch
or
a
quirk
was
shipped
to
saarkkad
iv
to
work
under
bertrand
malloy
permanent
terran
ambassador
to
his
utter
munificence
the
occeq
of
saarkkad
take
this
first
one
for
instance
malloy
ran
his
finger
down
the
columns
of
complex
symbolism
that
showed
the
complete
psychological
analysis
of
the
man
psychopathic
paranoia
the
man
was
technically
insane
he
could
be
as
lucid
as
the
next
man
most
of
the
time
but
he
was
morbidly
suspicious
that
every
man
hand
was
turned
against
him
he
trusted
no
one
and
was
perpetually
on
his
guard
against
imaginary
plots
and
persecutions
number
two
suffered
from
some
sort
of
emotional
block
that
left
him
continually
on
the
horns
of
one
dilemma
or
another
he
was
psychologically
incapable
of
making
a
decision
if
he
were
faced
with
two
or
more
possible
alternatives
of
any
major
importance
number
three
malloy
sighed
and
pushed
the
dossiers
away
from
him
no
two
men
were
alike
and
yet
there
sometimes
seemed
to
be
an
eternal
sameness
about
all
men
he
considered
himself
an
individual
for
instance
but
the
basic
similarity
there
after
all
he
was
how
old
he
glanced
at
the
earth
calendar
dial
that
was
automatically
correlated
with
the
saarkkadic
calendar
just
above
it
next
week
years
old
and
what
did
he
have
to
show
for
it
besides
flabby
muscles
sagging
skin
a
wrinkled
face
and
gray
hair
well
he
had
an
excellent
record
in
the
corps
if
nothing
else
one
of
the
top
men
in
his
field
and
he
had
his
memories
of
diane
dead
these
ten
years
but
still
beautiful
and
alive
in
his
recollections
and
he
grinned
softly
to
himself
he
had
saarkkad
he
glanced
up
at
the
ceiling
and
mentally
allowed
his
gaze
to
penetrate
it
to
the
blue
sky
beyond
it
out
there
was
the
terrible
emptiness
of
interstellar
space
a
great
yawning
infinite
chasm
capable
of
swallowing
men
ships
planets
suns
and
whole
galaxies
without
filling
its
insatiable
void
malloy
closed
his
eyes
somewhere
out
there
a
war
was
raging
he
even
like
to
think
of
that
but
it
was
necessary
to
keep
it
in
mind
somewhere
out
there
the
ships
of
earth
were
ranged
against
the
ships
of
the
alien
karna
in
the
most
important
war
that
mankind
had
yet
fought
and
malloy
knew
his
own
position
was
not
unimportant
in
that
war
he
was
not
in
the
battle
line
nor
even
in
the
major
production
line
but
it
was
necessary
to
keep
the
drug
supply
lines
flowing
from
saarkkad
and
that
meant
keeping
on
good
terms
with
the
saarkkadic
government
the
saarkkada
themselves
were
humanoid
in
physical
form
if
one
allowed
the
term
to
cover
a
wide
range
of
differences
but
their
minds
just
did
function
along
the
same
lines
for
nine
years
bertrand
malloy
had
been
ambassador
to
saarkkad
and
for
nine
years
no
saarkkada
had
ever
seen
him
to
have
shown
himself
to
one
of
them
would
have
meant
instant
loss
of
prestige
to
their
way
of
thinking
an
important
official
was
aloof
the
greater
his
importance
the
greater
must
be
his
isolation
the
occeq
of
saarkkad
himself
was
never
seen
except
by
a
handful
of
picked
nobles
who
themselves
were
never
seen
except
by
their
underlings
it
was
a
long
roundabout
way
of
doing
business
but
it
was
the
only
way
saarkkad
would
do
any
business
at
all
to
violate
the
rigid
social
setup
of
saarkkad
would
mean
the
instant
closing
off
of
the
supply
of
biochemical
products
that
the
saarkkadic
laboratories
produced
from
native
plants
and
animals
products
that
were
vitally
necessary
to
earth
war
and
which
could
be
duplicated
nowhere
else
in
the
known
universe
it
was
bertrand
malloy
job
to
keep
the
production
output
high
and
to
keep
the
materiel
flowing
towards
earth
and
her
allies
and
outposts
the
job
would
have
been
a
snap
cinch
in
the
right
circumstances
the
saarkkada
were
difficult
to
get
along
with
a
staff
of
men
could
have
handled
them
without
half
trying
but
malloy
did
have
men
they
could
be
spared
from
work
that
required
their
total
capacity
it
inefficient
to
waste
a
man
on
a
job
that
he
can
do
without
half
trying
where
there
are
more
important
jobs
that
will
tax
his
full
output
so
malloy
was
stuck
with
the
culls
not
the
worst
ones
of
course
there
were
places
in
the
galaxy
that
were
less
important
than
saarkkad
to
the
war
effort
malloy
knew
that
no
matter
what
was
wrong
with
a
man
as
long
as
he
had
the
mental
ability
to
dress
himself
and
get
himself
to
work
useful
work
could
be
found
for
him
physical
handicaps
were
at
all
difficult
to
deal
with
a
blind
man
can
work
very
well
in
the
total
darkness
of
an
darkroom
partial
or
total
losses
of
limbs
can
be
compensated
for
in
one
way
or
another
the
mental
disabilities
were
harder
to
deal
with
but
not
totally
impossible
on
a
world
without
liquor
a
dipsomaniac
could
be
channeled
easily
enough
and
he
better
not
try
fermenting
his
own
on
saarkkad
unless
he
brought
his
own
yeast
which
was
impossible
in
view
of
the
sterilization
regulations
but
malloy
did
like
to
stop
at
merely
thwarting
mental
quirks
he
liked
to
find
places
where
they
were
the
phone
chimed
malloy
flipped
it
on
with
a
practiced
hand
malloy
here
mr
malloy
said
a
careful
voice
a
special
communication
for
you
has
been
teletyped
in
from
earth
shall
i
bring
it
in
bring
it
in
miss
drayson
miss
drayson
was
a
case
in
point
she
was
uncommunicative
she
liked
to
gather
in
information
but
she
found
it
difficult
to
give
it
up
once
it
was
in
her
possession
malloy
had
made
her
his
private
secretary
nothing
but
got
out
of
malloy
office
without
his
direct
order
it
had
taken
malloy
a
long
time
to
get
it
into
miss
drayson
head
that
it
was
perfectly
all
right
even
desirable
for
her
to
keep
secrets
from
everyone
except
malloy
she
came
in
through
the
door
a
rather
handsome
woman
in
her
middle
thirties
clutching
a
sheaf
of
papers
in
her
right
hand
as
though
someone
might
at
any
instant
snatch
it
from
her
before
she
could
turn
it
over
to
malloy
she
laid
them
carefully
on
the
desk
if
anything
else
comes
in
let
you
know
immediately
sir
she
said
will
there
be
anything
else
malloy
let
her
stand
there
while
he
picked
up
the
communique
she
wanted
to
know
what
his
reaction
was
going
to
be
it
did
matter
because
no
one
would
ever
find
out
from
her
what
he
had
done
unless
she
was
ordered
to
tell
someone
he
read
the
first
paragraph
and
his
eyes
widened
involuntarily
armistice
he
said
in
a
low
whisper
there
a
chance
that
the
war
may
be
over
yes
sir
said
miss
drayson
in
a
hushed
voice
malloy
read
the
whole
thing
through
fighting
to
keep
his
emotions
in
check
miss
drayson
stood
there
calmly
her
face
a
mask
her
emotions
were
a
secret
finally
malloy
looked
up
i
let
you
know
as
soon
as
i
reach
a
decision
miss
drayson
i
think
i
hardly
need
say
that
no
news
of
this
is
to
leave
this
office
of
course
not
sir
malloy
watched
her
go
out
the
door
without
actually
seeing
her
the
war
was
over
at
least
for
a
while
he
looked
down
at
the
papers
again
the
karna
slowly
being
beaten
back
on
every
front
were
suing
for
peace
they
wanted
an
armistice
conference
immediately
earth
was
willing
interstellar
war
is
too
costly
to
allow
it
to
continue
any
longer
than
necessary
and
this
one
had
been
going
on
for
more
than
thirteen
years
now
peace
was
necessary
but
not
peace
at
any
price
the
trouble
was
that
the
karna
had
a
reputation
for
losing
wars
and
winning
at
the
peace
table
they
were
clever
persuasive
talkers
they
could
twist
a
disadvantage
to
an
advantage
and
make
their
own
strengths
look
like
weaknesses
if
they
won
the
armistice
they
be
able
to
retrench
and
rearm
and
the
war
would
break
out
again
within
a
few
years
now
at
this
point
in
time
they
could
be
beaten
they
could
be
forced
to
allow
supervision
of
the
production
potential
forced
to
disarm
rendered
impotent
but
if
the
armistice
went
to
their
own
advantage
already
they
had
taken
the
offensive
in
the
matter
of
the
peace
talks
they
had
sent
a
full
delegation
to
saarkkad
v
the
next
planet
out
from
the
saarkkad
sun
a
chilly
world
inhabited
only
by
animals
the
karna
considered
this
to
be
fully
neutral
territory
and
earth
could
argue
the
point
very
well
in
addition
they
demanded
that
the
conference
begin
in
three
days
terrestrial
time
the
trouble
was
that
interstellar
communication
beams
travel
a
devil
of
a
lot
faster
than
ships
it
would
take
more
than
a
week
for
the
earth
government
to
get
a
vessel
to
saarkkad
earth
had
been
caught
unprepared
for
an
armistice
they
objected
the
karna
pointed
out
that
the
saarkkad
sun
was
just
as
far
from
karn
as
it
was
from
earth
that
it
was
only
a
few
million
miles
from
a
planet
which
was
allied
with
earth
and
that
it
was
unfair
for
earth
to
take
so
much
time
in
preparing
for
an
armistice
why
had
earth
been
prepared
did
they
intend
to
fight
to
the
utter
destruction
of
karn
it
would
have
been
a
problem
at
all
if
earth
and
karn
had
fostered
the
only
two
intelligent
races
in
the
galaxy
the
sort
of
grandstanding
the
karna
were
putting
on
had
to
be
played
to
an
audience
but
there
were
other
intelligent
races
throughout
the
galaxy
most
of
whom
had
remained
as
neutral
as
possible
during
the
war
they
had
no
intention
of
sticking
their
figurative
noses
into
a
battle
between
the
two
most
powerful
races
in
the
galaxy
but
whoever
won
the
armistice
would
find
that
some
of
the
races
would
come
in
on
their
side
if
war
broke
out
again
if
the
karna
played
their
cards
right
their
side
would
be
strong
enough
next
time
to
win
so
earth
had
to
get
a
delegation
to
meet
with
the
karna
representatives
within
the
limit
or
lose
what
might
be
a
vital
point
in
the
negotiations
and
that
was
where
bertrand
malloy
came
in
he
had
been
appointed
minister
and
plenipotentiary
extraordinary
to
the
peace
conference
he
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
again
what
i
do
he
said
softly
on
the
second
day
after
the
arrival
of
the
communique
malloy
made
his
decision
he
flipped
on
his
intercom
and
said
miss
drayson
get
hold
of
james
nordon
and
kylen
braynek
i
want
to
see
them
both
immediately
send
nordon
in
first
and
tell
braynek
to
wait
yes
sir
and
keep
the
recorder
on
you
can
file
the
tape
later
yes
sir
malloy
knew
the
woman
would
listen
in
on
the
intercom
anyway
and
it
was
better
to
give
her
permission
to
do
so
james
nordon
was
tall
and
his
hair
was
graying
at
the
temples
and
his
handsome
face
looked
cool
and
efficient
malloy
waved
him
to
a
seat
nordon
i
have
a
job
for
you
it
probably
one
of
the
most
important
jobs
you
ever
have
in
your
life
it
can
mean
big
things
for
you
promotion
and
prestige
if
you
do
it
well
nordon
nodded
slowly
yes
sir
malloy
explained
the
problem
of
the
karna
peace
talks
we
need
a
man
who
can
outthink
them
malloy
finished
and
judging
from
your
record
i
think
you
that
man
it
involves
risk
of
course
if
you
make
the
wrong
decisions
your
name
will
be
mud
back
on
earth
but
i
do
think
there
much
chance
of
that
really
do
you
want
to
handle
operations
all
your
life
of
course
not
you
be
leaving
within
an
hour
for
saarkkad
nordon
nodded
again
yes
sir
certainly
am
i
to
go
alone
no
said
malloy
i
sending
an
assistant
with
you
a
man
named
kylen
braynek
ever
heard
of
him
nordon
shook
his
head
not
that
i
recall
malloy
should
i
have
not
necessarily
he
a
pretty
shrewd
operator
though
he
knows
a
lot
about
interstellar
law
and
he
capable
of
spotting
a
trap
a
mile
away
you
be
in
charge
of
course
but
i
want
you
to
pay
special
attention
to
his
advice
i
will
sir
nordon
said
gratefully
a
man
like
that
can
be
useful
right
now
you
go
into
the
anteroom
over
there
i
prepared
a
summary
of
the
situation
and
you
have
to
study
it
and
get
it
into
your
head
before
the
ship
leaves
that
is
much
time
but
it
the
karna
who
are
doing
the
pushing
not
us
as
soon
as
nordon
had
left
malloy
said
softly
send
in
braynek
miss
drayson
kylen
braynek
was
a
smallish
man
with
hair
that
lay
flat
against
his
skull
and
hard
penetrating
dark
eyes
that
were
shadowed
by
heavy
protruding
brows
malloy
asked
him
to
sit
down
again
malloy
went
through
the
explanation
of
the
peace
conference
naturally
they
be
trying
to
trick
you
every
step
of
the
way
malloy
went
on
they
shrewd
and
underhanded
we
simply
have
to
be
more
shrewd
and
more
underhanded
nordon
job
is
to
sit
quietly
and
evaluate
the
data
yours
will
be
to
find
the
loopholes
they
laying
out
for
themselves
and
plug
them
do
antagonize
them
but
do
baby
them
either
if
you
see
anything
underhanded
going
on
let
nordon
know
immediately
they
wo
get
anything
by
me
mr
malloy
by
the
time
the
ship
from
earth
got
there
the
peace
conference
had
been
going
on
for
four
days
bertrand
malloy
had
full
reports
on
the
whole
parley
as
relayed
to
him
through
the
ship
that
had
taken
nordon
and
braynek
to
saarkkad
secretary
of
state
blendwell
stopped
off
at
saarkkad
iv
before
going
on
to
v
to
take
charge
of
the
conference
he
was
a
tallish
lean
man
with
a
few
strands
of
gray
hair
on
the
top
of
his
otherwise
bald
scalp
and
he
wore
a
hearty
professional
smile
that
did
quite
make
it
to
his
calculating
eyes
he
took
malloy
hand
and
shook
it
warmly
how
are
you
mr
ambassador
fine
secretary
how
everything
on
earth
tense
they
waiting
to
see
what
is
going
to
happen
on
five
so
am
i
for
that
matter
his
eyes
were
curious
you
decided
not
to
go
yourself
eh
i
thought
it
better
not
to
i
sent
a
good
team
instead
would
you
like
to
see
the
reports
i
certainly
would
malloy
handed
them
to
the
secretary
and
as
he
read
malloy
watched
him
blendwell
was
a
political
appointee
a
good
man
malloy
had
to
admit
but
he
did
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
diplomatic
corps
when
blendwell
looked
up
from
the
reports
at
last
he
said
amazing
they
held
off
the
karna
at
every
point
they
beaten
them
back
they
managed
to
cope
with
and
outdo
the
finest
team
of
negotiators
the
karna
could
send
i
thought
they
would
said
malloy
trying
to
appear
modest
the
secretary
eyes
narrowed
i
heard
of
the
work
you
been
doing
here
with
ah
sick
men
is
this
one
of
your
ah
successes
malloy
nodded
i
think
so
the
karna
put
us
in
a
dilemma
so
i
threw
a
dilemma
right
back
at
them
how
do
you
mean
nordon
had
a
mental
block
against
making
decisions
if
he
took
a
girl
out
on
a
date
he
have
trouble
making
up
his
mind
whether
to
kiss
her
or
not
until
she
made
up
his
mind
for
him
one
way
or
the
other
that
kind
of
guy
until
he
presented
with
one
single
clear
decision
which
admits
of
no
alternatives
he
ca
move
at
all
as
you
can
see
the
karna
tried
to
give
us
several
choices
on
each
point
and
they
were
all
rigged
until
they
backed
down
to
a
single
point
and
proved
that
it
rigged
nordon
could
possibly
make
up
his
mind
i
drummed
into
him
how
important
this
was
and
the
more
importance
there
is
attached
to
his
decisions
the
more
incapable
he
becomes
of
making
them
the
secretary
nodded
slowly
what
about
braynek
paranoid
said
malloy
he
thinks
everyone
is
plotting
against
him
in
this
case
that
all
to
the
good
because
the
karna
plotting
against
him
no
matter
what
they
put
forth
braynek
is
convinced
that
there
a
trap
in
it
somewhere
and
he
digs
to
find
out
what
the
trap
is
even
if
there
is
a
trap
the
karna
ca
satisfy
braynek
because
he
convinced
that
there
to
be
somewhere
as
a
result
all
his
advice
to
nordon
and
all
his
questioning
on
the
wildest
possibilities
just
serves
to
keep
nordon
from
getting
unconfused
these
two
men
are
honestly
doing
their
best
to
win
at
the
peace
conference
and
they
got
the
karna
reeling
the
karna
can
see
that
we
not
trying
to
stall
our
men
are
actually
working
at
trying
to
reach
a
decision
but
what
the
karna
do
see
is
that
those
men
as
a
team
are
unbeatable
because
in
this
situation
they
psychologically
incapable
of
losing
again
the
secretary
of
state
nodded
his
approval
but
there
was
still
a
question
in
his
mind
since
you
know
all
that
could
you
have
handled
it
yourself
maybe
but
i
doubt
it
they
might
have
gotten
around
me
someway
by
sneaking
up
on
a
blind
spot
nordon
and
braynek
have
blind
spots
but
they
covered
with
armor
no
i
glad
i
could
go
it
better
this
way
the
secretary
of
state
raised
an
eyebrow
go
mr
ambassador
malloy
looked
at
him
did
you
know
i
wondered
why
you
appointed
me
in
the
first
place
no
i
could
go
the
reason
why
i
here
cooped
up
in
this
office
hiding
from
the
saarkkada
the
way
a
good
saarkkadic
bigshot
should
is
because
i
it
that
way
i
suffer
from
agoraphobia
and
xenophobia
i
have
to
be
drugged
to
be
put
on
a
spaceship
because
i
ca
take
all
that
empty
space
even
if
i
protected
from
it
by
a
steel
shell
a
look
of
revulsion
came
over
his
face
and
i
ca
aliens
