lady
is
hard
sitting
here
to
believe
that
if
i
would
call
for
a
cab
i
could
be
in
james
street
in
less
than
ten
minutes
of
time
nevertheless
it
is
true
i
have
proved
it
so
many
times
soon
i
shall
prove
it
for
the
last
men
than
i
will
sit
in
this
study
and
pace
the
lawn
in
the
garden
with
the
high
walls
the
lilies
and
laburnums
and
all
the
gay
fellowship
of
flowers
will
find
a
new
waterman
the
thrushes
and
blackbirds
and
will
find
a
new
victualler
the
private
forecourt
so
richly
hung
with
creeper
will
give
back
my
footfalls

more

make
bold

the
characters
in

are
imaginary
and
have
no
reference
to
any
living
jonah
and
chapter
i
how
berry
stepped
into
the
breach
and
jonah
came
first
and
was
first
served
shall
i
massage
it
said
berry
the
suggestion
was
loudly
condemned
right
replied
my
that
reduces
us
to
on
the
command
make
your
mind
a
blank
that
should
be
difficult
realise
that
the
agony
you
are
suffering
is
imaginary
and
close
both
legs
one
on
the
command
you
can
go
i
said
wearily
you
can
go
i
write
to
you
when
i
want
you
do
bother
to
leave
your
address
but
how
vulgar
said
berry
how
very
vulgar
he
paused
to
glance
at
his
watch
dear
me
ten
and
i
have
had
my
beer
yet
he
stepped
to
the
door
should
the
pain
become
excruciating
turn
upon
the
stomach
and
repeat
kipling
should
my
sister
and
jill
fairly
bundled
him
out
of
the
doorway
sitting
by
my
side
upon
the
bed
adèle
laid
her
cheek
against
mine
is
it
any
better
old
chap
the
pain
practically
stopped
said
i
thank
heaven
putting
it
up
done
that
but
i
in
for
a
stiff
leg
dear
i
know
that
not
that
that
matters
really
but
it
means
i
ca
drive
it
was
unfortunate
that
before
i
had
been
upon
french
soil
for
half
an
hour
i
should
be
kicked
by
a
testy
of
whose
existence
much
less
proximity
thanks
to
the
poor
lighting
of
boulogne
i
had
been
totally
unaware
i
had
been
kicked
upon
the
same
knee
in
on
that
occasion
i
had
gone
with
a
stiff
leg
for
a
fortnight
it
seemed
unpleasantly
probable
that
history
would
wholly
repeat
itself
i
can
travel
i
continued
i
shall
be
able
to
walk
with
a
stick
but
i
sha
be
able
to
drive
and
as
jonah
ca
drive
more
than
one
car
at
a
time
berry
have
to
take
the
other
at
my
words
daphne
started
and
jill
gave
a
little
cry
boy
he
only
had
three
lessons
i
know
but
he
get
through
somehow
i
sit
by
his
side
shorten
my
life
of
course
but
what
else
can
we
do
even
if
fitch
was
here
there
no
room
for
a
chauffeur
and
you
find
towing
tedious
after
the
first
five
hundred
miles
with
a
white
forefinger
to
her
lips
my
sister
regarded
me
i
know
he
a
disgrace
she
said
slowly
but
he
he
the
only
husband
i
got
boy
and
he
has
his
points
she
concluded
softly
with
the
tenderest
smile
i
stretched
out
a
hand
and
drew
her
towards
me
is
he
my
only
brother
darling
is
he
berry
i
see
he
comes
to
no
harm
you
really
think
it
safe
perfectly
for
one
thing
i
shall
be
able
to
reach
the
rather
more
easily
than
he
will
my
sister
kissed
me
i
like
the
sound
of
that
she
said
cheerfully
it
was
the
fifth
day
of
november
and
all
six
of
us
were
for
the
pyrenees
a
month
ago
adèle
and
i
had
visited
pau
we
had
found
the
place
good
conceived
the
idea
of
spending
the
winter
there
and
wired
for
instructions
within
three
days
we
had
received
four
letters
the
first
was
from
jill
darling
sweet
of
you
both
to
think
of
it
we
all
simply
thrilled
try
and
get
one
with
a
and
some
wistaria
we
miss
you
awfully
tell
boy
nobby
is
splendid
and
sends
his
love
oh
and
he
smells
his
coat
every
day
is
it
pathetic
p
my
hair
wo
go
like
yours
but
i
going
to
try
again
all
our
love
to
you
and
your
husband
then
came
jonah
boy
about
tobacco
you
might
examine
the
chances
of
smuggling
sending
you
a
hundred
cigarettes
conspicuously
labelled
benger
food
to
see
what
happens
i
suppose
the
roads
are
pretty
bad
what
about
fishing
i
subsequently
received
a
curt
communication
to
the
effect
that
there
was
a
package
addressed
to
me
and
purporting
to
contain
farine
lying
at
the
local
adèle
was
horrified
i
endeavoured
to
reassure
her
tore
up
the
notice
and
cursed
my
cousin
savagely
when
three
days
had
passed
and
i
was
still
at
liberty
adèle
plucked
up
heart
but
for
the
rest
of
our
visit
upon
sight
of
a
gendarme
she
was
apt
to
become
distrait
and
lose
the
thread
of
her
discourse
a
letter
from
daphne
had
arrived
the
next
day
adèle
all
delighted
with
the
do
think
six
months
would
be
too
long
i
agree
that
a
villa
would
be
much
the
best
and
we
perfectly
content
to
leave
the
selection
to
you
you
know
what
room
we
must
have
i
suppose
two
bathrooms
would
be
too
much
to
expect
about
servants
we
can
bring
some
but
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
french
cook
to
do
the
marketing
and
perhaps
one
other
to
keep
her
company
and
help
in
the
kitchen
and
house
will
you
see
what
you
can
do
plate
and
linen
of
course
we
can
bring
by
the
way
madge
willoughby
tells
me
that
last
year
in
france
they
had
some
difficulty
about
coal
so
tell
boy
to
see
if
he
can
order
some
now
all
this
of
course
if
you
can
get
a
loving
sister
berry
came
last
brother
we
shall
ourselves
winter
this
year
at
pau
eh
bien
are
perhaps
worse
places
at
least
the
sun
will
shine
ma
foi
to
think
that
upon
you
depend
all
the
tant
pis
suite
must
face
itself
south
and
adjoin
the
bathroom
otherwise
i
can
not
answer
for
my
health
or
for
the
matter
of
that
yours
omit
from
your
next
letter
any
reference
to
the
mountains
impressions
of
the
pyrenees
by
a
fool
who
has
been
married
for
less
than
three
weeks
not
only
are
valueless
but
make
my
gorge
rise
élévation
très
dangereuse
brings
me
to
your
wife
how
is
the
shrew
tell
her
i
have
some
socks
for
her
to
darn
on
her
was
thoughtful
of
you
to
emphasise
the
fact
that
the
season
of
green
figs
to
a
surfeit
of
which
i
sincerely
hope
you
will
succumb
will
be
over
before
i
reach
pau
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
five
hundred
cigars
george
sent
you
will
be
over
even
earlier
besides
i
shall
at
once
console
and
distend
myself
foie
gras
must
have
a
french
cook
of
course
a
very
priestess
of
gluttony
skilful
to
lure
the
timid
appetite
from
the
fastness
of
enfin
ask
myself
why
i
shall
have
made
the
trouble
to
write
to
you
you
have
of
course
an
opportunity
unique
of
making
a
mess
with
a
copper
bottom
of
my
life
for
six
mais
mon
dieu
que
vous
serez
puni
je
vieil
haricot
sur
les
deux
joues
this
here
letter
is
a
talisman
and
should
be
worn
upon
the
exterior
of
the
abdominal
wall
during
a
considering
the
nature
of
our
holiday
adèle
and
i
did
not
do
so
badly
before
we
left
pau
i
had
signed
the
lease
of
an
attractive
villa
standing
well
in
its
own
grounds
and
commanding
a
prospect
of
the
mountains
as
fine
as
could
be
adèle
had
engaged
a
frenchwoman
and
her
daughter
both
of
whom
were
well
spoken
of
and
had
been
in
the
service
of
english
and
american
families
before
the
war
a
supply
of
fuel
had
been
reserved
and
various
minor
arrangements
had
been
concluded
ere
we
were
back
at
white
ladies
october
was
old
it
had
been
jonah
belated
suggestion
that
our
migration
should
be
accomplished
by
car
it
was
jonah
enterprise
that
reduced
the
upheaval
of
our
plans
consequent
upon
the
instant
adoption
of
his
idea
to
order
and
convenience
by
the
third
of
november
everything
had
been
arranged
the
heavier
stuff
had
been
embarked
for
bordeaux
the
servants
were
ready
to
accompany
the
rest
of
the
luggage
by
way
of
paris
the
rolls
had
been
sold
in
the
latter
place
we
had
purchased
two
smaller
cars
both
new
both
of
the
same
make
both
coupés
both
painted
blue
indeed
but
for
their
numbers
which
were
consecutive
we
could
not
have
told
them
apart
each
seated
three
inside
comfortably
while
a
respectable
quantity
of
baggage
could
be
easily
bestowed
in
each
of
the
capacious
boots
certainly
my
cousin
staff
work
had
been
superb
in
the
circumstances
it
seemed
hardly
fair
that
upon
this
the
first
night
of
our
venture
he
should
be
faced
with
the
labour
of
shepherding
both
cars
first
clear
of
the
customs
and
then
one
by
one
through
the
cold
dark
streets
which
led
from
the
quay
to
the
garage
of
the
hotel
as
if
she
had
read
my
thought
poor
jonah
said
adèle
suddenly
i
wonder
a
knock
upon
the
door
interrupted
her
this
being
opened
admitted
nobby
two
porters
our
luggage
two
waiters
a
large
dish
of
sandwiches
some
beer
coffee
and
its
accessories
jonah
and
finally
berry
you
must
be
tired
said
the
latter
let
sit
down
shall
i
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
how
the
comic
i
well
remember
when
i
was
in
plumbago
a
somewhat
similar
accident
a
large
on
its
wrong
side
at
the
present
moment
said
i
wrestling
with
the
advances
we
more
concerned
with
your
future
than
with
your
past
it
the
bank
of
england
to
a
of
figs
that
morning
i
shall
have
a
stiff
leg
very
good
i
paused
those
three
lessons
you
had
i
added
carelessly
will
come
in
useful
jonah
who
was
filling
a
tumbler
started
violently
and
spilled
some
beer
then
he
leaned
against
the
wall
and
began
to
laugh
helplessly
coldly
berry
regarded
him
i
fail
he
said
stiffly
to
see
the
point
of
your
mirth
i
gather
that
it
is
proposed
to
enjoy
my
services
for
the
propulsion
of
one
of
the
automobiles
that
while
you
will
be
responsible
for
the
of
ping
these
delicate
hands
will
flick
pong
across
france
very
good
let
the
press
be
informed
call
forth
the
what
would
have
been
a
somewhat
sordid
drive
will
become
a
winged
flight
sublime
and
deathless
i
trust
so
said
jonah
six
hundred
miles
with
a
fool
at
the
wheel
is
a
tall
order
but
if
your
companions
survive
the
first
two
days
they
ought
to
pull
through
try
not
to
do
more
than
five
pounds
worth
of
damage
to
the
gallon
wo
you
sour
grapes
said
berry
the
professional
reviles
the
distinguished
amateur
seriously
said
i
it
no
laughing
matter
i
agree
said
daphne
you
have
to
just
crawl
along
all
the
way
after
all
we
got
six
months
to
get
there
in
promise
me
you
try
and
pass
anything
i
promise
replied
her
husband
should
another
vehicle
approach
i
stop
the
engine
and
go
and
hide
in
a
wood
till
it
gone
fool
said
his
wife
i
meant
anything
of
course
you
know
i
did
promise
you
wo
try
and
rush
past
things
just
to
get
in
front
of
them
i
took
up
the
cudgels
we
got
to
get
along
darling
and
he
ca
give
a
promise
like
that
you
would
want
to
do
fifty
miles
behind
a
would
you
remember
i
shall
be
by
his
side
he
may
be
holding
the
wheel
but
i
shall
be
driving
the
car
make
him
promise
to
obey
me
implicitly
if
you
like
that
right
said
jill
you
will
wo
you
berry
the
latter
looked
at
adèle
do
you
also
subscribe
to
my
humiliation
he
said
adèle
smiled
and
nodded
unquestionably
she
said
by
the
time
you
get
to
pau
you
be
an
expert
and
then
you
can
teach
me
the
said
my
well
well
so
far
as
in
me
lies
i
do
as
i
told
but
i
insist
upon
plain
english
not
going
to
be
suddenly
yelled
at
to
or
the
brake
or
the
throttle
or
something
it
makes
me
want
to
burst
into
tears
that
fellow
who
was
teaching
me
asked
me
without
any
warning
and
in
the
middle
of
some
sheep
what
i
should
do
if
one
of
my
ends
were
to
run
out
i
said
i
should
consult
a
specialist
but
the
question
upset
me
indirectly
it
also
upset
the
shepherd
which
reminds
me
i
never
knew
a
human
being
could
jump
so
far
the
moment
he
felt
the
radiator
you
never
told
us
this
said
daphne
reproachfully
if
i
known
you
knocked
somebody
down
i
never
knocked
him
down
said
berry
i
tell
you
he
jumped
we
stopped
of
course
and
explained
he
was
a
little
nettled
at
first
but
we
parted
on
the
best
of
terms
it
all
very
well
said
my
sister
but
i
no
idea
every
dog
must
have
his
bite
said
i
laughing
he
wo
do
it
again
and
now
since
i
tethered
will
somebody
give
me
some
beer
then
and
there
supper
was
consumed
a
vigorous
discussion
of
the
turn
events
had
taken
and
the
advancement
and
scrutiny
of
a
variety
of
high
speculations
regarding
the
probable
style
of
our
progress
to
pau
prevailed
until
past
twelve
but
at
length
the
others
were
evicted
and
adèle
nobby
and
i
were
able
to
prepare
for
the
night
out
of
the
luxurious
silence
of
a
hot
bath
adèle
voice
came
floating
into
the
bedroom
boy
yes
lady
i
wish
i
was
going
with
you
instead
of
daphne
so
do
i
i
said
heartily
adèle
sighed
then
it
ca
be
helped
she
said
i
think
on
the
whole
she
would
have
worried
more
than
i
shall
not
a
doubt
of
it
said
i
cheerfully
as
she
said
berry
the
only
husband
she
got
adèle
choked
presently
the
real
reason
she
said
is
because
she
mistrusts
her
husband
even
more
than
i
trust
mine
when
i
had
worked
this
out
aha
i
said
pleasedly
but
then
of
course
said
adèle
she
been
married
much
longer
with
rouen
as
our
objective
we
left
boulogne
the
next
morning
at
ten
to
speak
more
accurately
we
left
the
hotel
at
ten
and
boulogne
itself
some
forty
minutes
later
the
negotiation
of
an
leading
out
of
the
town
was
responsible
for
the
delay
my
sister
and
i
shall
remember
that
hill
so
long
as
we
live
so
i
imagine
will
berry
we
were
up
when
he
stopped
the
engine
for
the
first
time
we
were
still
up
when
he
stopped
it
for
the
eighth
time
indeed
it
was
at
this
juncture
that
i
suggested
that
he
should
rest
from
his
labours
and
smoke
a
cigarette
my
shook
his
head
shall
i
slide
down
backwards
and
begin
again
he
inquired
no
thanks
said
i
i
have
a
foolish
preference
for
facing
death
think
we
could
push
it
up
said
daphne
frankly
said
i
i
do
you
see
she
weighs
over
a
ton
without
the
luggage
berry
cleared
his
throat
i
am
not
he
said
going
through
the
farce
of
asking
what
i
do
wrong
because
i
know
the
answer
it
not
the
right
one
but
you
seem
incapable
of
giving
any
other
i
am
said
i
well
do
say
it
said
berry
because
if
you
do
i
shall
scream
no
man
born
of
woman
could
let
in
that
clutch
more
slowly
and
yet
you
say
it
too
fast
the
truth
is
there
something
wrong
with
the
car
there
soon
will
be
i
retorted
the
starter
will
fail
then
every
time
you
stop
the
engine
you
have
to
get
out
and
crank
make
you
think
me
think
yelled
berry
think
i
have
been
thinking
think
i
not
thinking
now
have
i
almost
burst
my
brains
with
thinking
daphne
began
to
laugh
helplessly
that
right
added
her
husband
savagely
see
the
humorous
side
i
may
go
mad
any
minute
but
do
let
that
stop
you
and
with
that
he
set
his
foot
upon
the
when
he
had
stopped
the
engine
another
three
times
he
applied
the
with
unnecessary
violence
sank
back
in
his
seat
and
folded
his
hands
my
sister
and
i
clung
to
one
another
in
an
agony
of
stifled
mirth
berry
closed
his
eyes
my
work
he
said
quietly
is
over
i
now
see
that
it
is
ordained
that
we
shall
not
leave
this
spot
there
probably
an
angel
in
the
way
with
a
drawn
sword
and
the
car
sees
it
although
we
ca
any
way
i
not
going
to
fight
against
fate
and
now
do
speak
to
me
i
going
to
dwell
on
and
and
other
vehicles
i
sha
last
many
minutes
and
i
should
like
to
die
in
peace
with
a
swift
rush
ping
drew
up
alongside
from
its
interior
adèle
jill
nobby
and
jonah
peered
at
us
excitedly
hullo
said
the
latter
what
up
go
away
said
berry
drive
on
to
your
doom
an
apparition
has
appeared
to
us
warning
us
not
to
proceed
it
was
quite
definite
about
it
jonah
old
chap
said
i
i
afraid
you
for
it
unless
you
take
us
up
we
shall
be
here
till
nightfall
with
a
groan
my
cousin
opened
his
door
and
descended
into
the
road
one
minute
later
we
were
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
now
said
daphne
with
the
open
upon
her
knees
now
for
montreuil
when
five
minutes
had
passed
and
my
was
breathing
through
his
nose
less
audibly
i
lighted
a
cigarette
and
ventured
to
look
about
me
it
was
certainly
a
fine
highway
that
we
were
using
broad
direct
smooth
beyond
all
expectation
it
lay
like
a
sash
upon
the
countryside
rippling
away
into
the
distance
as
though
it
were
indeed
that
long
long
lane
that
hath
no
turning
presently
a
curve
would
come
to
save
the
face
of
the
proverb
but
the
bends
were
few
in
number
and
as
a
general
rule
did
little
more
than
switch
the
road
a
point
or
two
to
east
or
west
as
the
mood
took
them
there
was
little
traffic
and
the
surface
was
dry
something
had
been
said
about
the
two
cars
keeping
together
but
i
was
not
surprised
when
jonah
passed
us
like
a
whirlwind
before
we
were
to
samer
he
explained
afterwards
that
he
had
stuck
it
as
long
as
he
could
but
that
to
hold
a
car
down
to
twenty
on
a
road
like
a
private
was
worse
than
pulling
fired
by
jonah
example
berry
laid
hold
of
the
wheel
and
we
took
the
next
hill
at
it
was
a
brilliant
day
but
the
cold
was
intense
and
i
think
we
were
all
glad
that
pong
was
a
closeable
car
that
winter
reign
had
begun
was
most
apparent
there
was
a
bleak
look
upon
the
country
face
that
had
been
poplars
made
us
gaunt
avenues
here
and
there
the
cold
jewellery
of
frost
was
sparkling
i
fell
to
wondering
how
far
south
we
must
go
to
find
it
warmer
presently
we
came
to
montreuil
as
we
entered
the
little
town
this
said
i
was
the
headquarters
of
the
british
expeditionary
force
from
behind
these
walls
do
talk
said
daphne
or
i
shall
make
a
mistake
round
to
the
left
here
wait
a
minute
no
that
right
and
straight
on
what
a
blessing
this
is
not
too
fast
berry
straight
on
this
ought
to
be
she
peered
out
of
the
window
yes
that
right
now
in
a
minute
you
turn
to
the
left
after
all
i
reflected
we
had
to
get
to
rouen
and
it
was
past
we
had
sworn
not
to
lunch
before
we
had
passed
abbeville
so
since
we
had
breakfasted
betimes
i
furtively
encouraged
my
to
put
her
along
his
response
was
to
overtake
and
pass
a
lorry
upon
the
wrong
side
drive
an
unsuspecting
bicyclist
into
a
ditch
and
swerve
like
a
drunken
to
avoid
a
dead
fowl
as
we
were
going
over
forty
it
was
all
over
before
we
knew
where
we
were
but
the
impression
of
impending
death
was
vivid
and
lasting
and
nearly
a
minute
had
elapsed
before
i
could
trust
my
voice
are
we
still
alive
breathed
daphne
i
afraid
to
open
my
eyes
i
think
we
must
be
said
i
at
least
i
still
thirsty
if
anything
to
go
by
i
consider
said
berry
that
the
way
in
which
i
extricated
us
from
that
was
little
short
of
masterly
that
cyclist
ought
to
remember
me
in
his
prayers
i
do
want
to
discourage
you
i
said
grimly
but
i
should
bank
on
it
the
plan
of
abbeville
printed
in
the
guide
was
as
simple
to
read
as
were
my
sister
directions
to
follow
at
a
critical
moment
however
berry
felt
unable
to
turn
to
the
right
the
trouble
is
he
explained
as
we
plunged
into
a
maze
of
back
streets
i
only
got
two
hands
and
feet
to
have
got
round
that
corner
i
should
have
had
to
take
out
the
clutch
go
into
third
release
the
brake
put
out
a
hand
accelerate
sound
the
clarion
and
put
the
wheel
over
simultaneously
now
with
seven
limbs
i
could
have
done
it
with
eight
i
could
also
have
scratched
myself
an
operation
i
may
say
which
can
be
no
longer
postponed
he
drew
up
before
a
and
mopped
his
face
what
a
beautiful
bunch
of
sausages
he
added
shall
we
get
some
or
think
they
be
dead
before
we
get
to
rouen
in
contemptuous
silence
daphne
lowered
her
window
accosted
the
first
and
asked
the
way
an
admission
that
it
was
possible
to
reach
the
neufchatel
road
without
actually
retracing
our
steps
was
at
length
extracted
and
after
a
prolonged
study
of
the
plan
my
sister
gave
the
word
to
proceed
save
that
we
twice
mounted
the
pavement
grazed
a
waggon
and
literally
brushed
an
urchin
out
of
the
way
our
emergence
from
abbeville
was
accomplished
without
further
incident
with
the
knowledge
that
barring
accidents
we
ought
to
reach
rouen
by
five
we
ventured
to
devour
a
wayside
lunch
some
ten
minutes
later
it
was
after
neufchatel
that
the
surface
of
the
great
grey
road
argued
neglect
in
no
uncertain
terms
for
mile
after
mile
fat
bulls
of
basan
in
the
shape
of
gigantic
gaped
threateningly
upon
us
berry
who
was
driving
much
better
did
all
that
he
could
but
only
a
could
have
picked
his
way
between
them
the
car
hiccoughed
along
piteously
with
the
approach
of
darkness
driving
became
a
burden
being
driven
a
weariness
of
the
flesh
and
we
were
all
thankful
when
we
slid
down
a
paved
hill
into
the
cathedral
city
and
presently
past
the
great
church
and
on
to
the
very
bank
of
the
river
seine
the
others
had
been
awaiting
us
for
nearly
two
hours
with
this
sun
said
adèle
they
ought
to
be
glorious
impiously
i
reflected
that
berry
was
almost
certainly
enjoying
his
breakfast
in
bed
i
expect
they
will
i
said
abstractedly
adèle
slid
an
arm
through
mine
it
very
sweet
of
you
to
come
with
me
boy
i
stood
still
and
looked
at
her
you
a
wonderful
child
i
said
when
you
speak
like
that
i
want
to
kick
myself
and
burst
into
song
simultaneously
i
suppose
love
i
expect
so
said
adèle
mischievously
five
minutes
later
we
were
standing
beneath
the
shadow
of
chartres
cathedral
we
had
come
my
wife
and
i
to
see
the
windows
the
day
before
had
been
dull
and
what
light
there
was
had
been
failing
when
we
had
visited
the
shrine
however
was
all
glorious
if
we
had
risen
early
we
had
our
reward
the
place
had
become
a
gallery
with
jewels
for
pictures
out
of
the
sombre
depths
the
aged
webs
of
magic
glowed
with
the
matchless
flush
of
precious
stones
from
every
side
colours
we
had
not
dreamed
of
enriched
our
eyes
to
make
the
great
west
rose
the
world
herself
might
have
been
spoiled
of
her
gems
looking
upon
this
mystery
no
man
can
wonder
that
the
art
is
lost
clearly
it
went
the
way
of
babel
for
of
such
is
the
kingdom
of
heaven
windows
the
sun
was
lighting
were
at
once
more
real
and
more
magnificent
crimsons
and
blues
purples
and
greens
yellows
and
violets
blazed
with
that
ancient
majesty
which
only
lives
in
the
peal
of
a
great
organ
the
call
of
a
silver
trumpet
or
the
proud
roll
of
drums
out
of
the
gorgeous
pageant
rays
issued
like
messengers
to
badge
the
cold
grey
stone
with
tender
images
and
set
a
smile
upon
the
face
of
stateliness
such
old
old
panes
says
someone
six
hundred
years
and
more
how
wonderful
pardon
me
but
i
have
seen
them
and
it
is
not
wonderful
at
all
beneath
their
spell
centuries
shrink
to
afternoons
the
windows
of
chartres
are
above
time
they
are
the
peepholes
of
immortality
we
returned
to
the
hotel
in
time
to
contribute
to
a
heated
argument
upon
the
subject
of
tipping
it
perfectly
simple
said
berry
you
think
of
what
you
would
hate
to
have
given
before
the
war
double
it
add
forty
per
cent
for
the
increased
cost
of
living
halve
it
because
of
the
exchange
ask
them
whether
they
like
it
in
notes
or
gold
and
pay
them
in
i
want
to
know
said
daphne
what
to
give
the
chambermaid
eight
francs
fifty
that
the
equivalent
of
before
the
war
nonsense
said
his
wife
five
francs
is
heaps
and
you
know
it
i
think
it
too
much
said
berry
give
her
one
instead
and
tell
her
you
hidden
the
rest
in
the
bathroom
and
that
when
she
touches
the
she
warm
as
a
matter
of
fact
said
jill
uneasily
it
all
over
i
done
it
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
then
tell
us
the
worst
said
i
and
get
it
over
i
i
afraid
i
gave
her
rather
a
lot
but
she
had
a
nice
face
she
had
a
nice
step
said
berry
i
noticed
that
about
five
this
morning
how
much
said
i
relentlessly
jill
looked
round
guiltily
i
gave
her
fifty
she
said
there
was
a
shriek
of
laughter
did
she
faint
said
berry
or
try
to
eat
grass
or
anything
gravely
jill
shook
her
head
she
talked
a
great
deal
very
fast
i
could
follow
her
and
then
she
turned
away
and
began
to
cry
i
was
so
glad
i
done
it
so
are
we
all
said
daphne
she
was
supported
heartily
jonah
looked
at
his
watch
i
suggest
he
said
that
we
start
at
eleven
then
we
shall
fetch
up
in
time
to
see
the
cathedral
how
far
is
tours
said
daphne
miles
let
keep
together
said
jill
it
much
more
fun
her
brother
shook
his
head
i
do
want
he
said
to
be
arrested
for
loitering
do
you
worry
said
berry
we
would
be
seen
with
you
jonah
sighed
where
there
a
will
there
a
way
he
murmured
more
said
berry
we
regard
you
rather
less
than
the
dust
beneath
our
detachable
wheels
you
pollute
the
road
with
your
hoghood
i
suppose
it
no
use
asking
you
to
keep
behind
us
none
whatever
replied
our
cousin
why
should
we
well
said
berry
supposing
a
tire
discovers
that
i
driving
and
bursts
with
pride
who
going
to
change
the
wheel
jonah
stifled
a
yawn
you
ca
have
it
both
ways
he
said
if
we
to
warn
people
not
to
shoot
at
you
we
must
be
in
front
berry
regarded
his
perhaps
you
right
he
said
think
of
me
when
you
get
your
third
puncture
wo
you
and
remember
that
my
heart
goes
out
to
you
in
your
tire
trouble
and
that
you
have
all
my
love
then
you
wo
sweat
so
much
half
an
hour
later
pong
stormed
out
of
the
garage
and
into
the
des
adèle
wish
had
been
granted
and
she
was
travelling
with
berry
and
me
instead
of
with
jonah
for
this
new
order
of
battle
nobby
was
solely
responsible
upon
the
first
day
journey
the
terrier
had
whined
all
the
way
to
rouen
because
he
had
wanted
to
be
with
me
as
one
of
his
audience
jonah
had
been
offensively
outspoken
regarding
this
predilection
upon
the
following
day
the
dog
desire
had
been
gratified
whereupon
he
had
whined
all
the
way
to
chartres
because
he
was
apart
from
adèle
commenting
upon
this
unsuspected
devotion
berry
had
been
quite
as
outspoken
as
jonah
and
much
more
offensive
naturally
to
withstand
such
importunity
was
out
of
the
question
and
since
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
leave
berry
the
line
of
least
resistance
was
followed
and
daphne
and
adèle
changed
places
our
way
out
of
chartres
was
short
and
simple
and
with
the
exception
of
temporarily
obstructing
two
trams
by
the
artless
expedient
of
remaining
motionless
upon
the
permanent
way
pong
emerged
from
the
city
without
a
stain
upon
his
character
the
vendôme
road
looked
promising
and
proved
excellent
very
soon
we
were
flying
for
all
that
jonah
overtook
us
as
we
were
nearing
bonneval
it
was
some
thirty
minutes
later
as
we
were
leaving
châteaudun
that
a
with
a
blue
nose
motioned
to
us
to
stop
standing
upon
the
near
pavement
the
fellow
was
at
once
conversing
with
a
postman
and
looking
malevolently
in
our
direction
i
think
we
all
scented
mischief
what
can
he
want
growled
berry
as
he
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
he
probably
being
officious
said
i
getting
our
papers
ready
we
strangers
and
he
in
a
bad
humour
consequently
he
going
to
scrutinise
our
passports
passes
and
certificates
to
see
if
he
can
accuse
us
of
anything
happily
they
all
in
order
so
he
be
disappointed
when
he
thoroughly
satisfied
that
he
can
bring
no
charge
against
us
he
order
us
to
proceed
he
taking
his
time
about
it
observed
my
i
looked
up
from
the
documents
my
gentleman
was
still
talking
to
the
postman
while
his
pig
eyes
were
still
surveying
the
car
from
his
companion
demeanour
he
seemed
to
be
whetting
his
wit
at
our
expense
this
is
intolerable
said
i
ask
him
what
he
wants
lady
adèle
leaned
forward
and
put
her
head
out
of
the
window
i
think
you
wished
us
to
stop
the
waved
his
hand
wait
he
said
insolently
the
postman
sniggered
shamefacedly
adèle
sank
back
in
her
seat
her
cheeks
flaming
in
a
voice
trembling
with
passion
i
conjured
berry
to
proceed
the
moment
the
car
moved
the
official
sprang
forward
gesticulating
furiously
as
we
passed
him
i
put
out
my
head
now
it
our
turn
i
said
warmly
to
make
the
postman
laugh
from
the
hoarse
yells
which
followed
us
it
was
clear
that
we
had
left
the
fellow
beside
himself
with
rage
looking
back
through
the
little
window
i
could
see
him
dancing
suddenly
he
stopped
peered
after
us
and
then
swung
about
and
ran
ridiculously
up
the
street
blast
him
he
going
to
telephone
said
i
where
the
map
together
adèle
and
i
pored
over
the
sections
if
said
berry
you
going
to
direct
me
to
turn
off
for
sake
be
quick
about
it
at
the
present
moment
i
just
blinding
along
into
the
blue
and
for
all
i
know
an
oversized
hornets
nest
of
course
they
may
sting
when
there
an
in
the
month
but
then
they
might
know
that
or
am
i
thinking
of
oysters
they
stop
us
at
vendôme
said
i
not
before
right
oh
we
must
turn
to
the
right
at
cloyes
and
make
for
calais
we
can
get
round
to
tours
that
way
it
take
us
about
twenty
miles
out
of
our
way
but
yes
and
when
we
do
show
up
at
vendôme
they
wire
to
calais
seriously
as
shakespeare
says
i
all
of
a
that
we
should
be
stopped
at
calais
was
not
likely
and
i
said
as
much
what
did
worry
me
because
it
was
far
more
probable
was
that
when
they
drew
blank
at
vendôme
the
authorities
would
telephone
to
tours
any
apprehension
however
regarding
our
reception
at
that
city
was
soon
mercifully
unmercifully
and
somewhat
paradoxically
overshadowed
by
a
more
instant
anxiety
lest
we
should
never
arrive
there
at
all
from
the
moment
we
left
the
main
road
the
obstacles
in
the
shape
of
uncharted
roads
and
villages
pavements
cattle
goats
a
horse
fair
and
finally
a
series
of
appalling
gradients
opposed
our
passage
all
things
considered
my
drove
admirably
but
it
was
a
bad
business
and
while
my
wife
and
berry
were
very
staunch
i
think
we
all
regretted
that
i
had
been
so
high
with
blue
nose
night
had
fallen
ere
we
slunk
into
tours
fully
expecting
to
find
that
the
others
had
given
us
up
we
were
astounded
to
learn
at
the
hotel
that
ping
had
not
yet
arrived
indeed
we
had
finished
dinner
and
were
debating
seriously
whether
we
should
take
a
hired
car
and
go
to
seek
them
when
there
was
a
flurry
of
steps
in
the
corridor
nobby
rushed
to
the
door
and
the
next
moment
daphne
and
jill
burst
into
the
room
my
darling
said
berry
advancing
where
on
earth
have
you
been
my
sister
put
her
arms
about
his
neck
and
looked
into
his
eyes
kiss
me
she
said
jonah
just
coming
her
husband
stared
at
her
then
is
it
as
bad
as
all
that
he
said
dear
dear
and
how
did
he
get
the
booze
somebody
cleared
his
throat
i
swung
round
to
see
jonah
regarding
us
you
three
beauties
he
said
four
with
nobby
but
what
do
you
mean
said
adèle
what
have
we
done
done
cried
jonah
done
where
think
we
been
it
ca
have
been
goats
that
stopped
you
said
berry
because
i
had
all
the
goats
there
was
a
great
rally
of
goats
at
calais
this
afternoon
it
was
a
wonderful
smell
i
mean
sight
guess
again
said
jonah
grimly
you
have
been
waiting
for
us
on
the
road
said
i
you
getting
warmer
was
the
reply
adèle
gave
a
sudden
cry
jonah
she
gasped
you
been
at
vendôme
i
started
violently
and
berry
who
was
about
to
speak
choked
that
right
said
jonah
shortly
nice
little
place
what
i
saw
of
it
lovely
view
from
the
he
leaned
against
the
mantelpiece
and
lighted
a
cigarette
it
may
amuse
you
to
know
he
added
that
the
expiation
of
your
crime
took
us
six
and
a
half
hours
and
cost
five
hundred
francs
in
response
to
our
thirsty
enquiries
the
tale
came
bubbling
my
surmise
that
the
would
telephone
to
vendôme
had
been
he
had
forwarded
an
exact
description
of
pong
together
with
the
letters
and
the
first
three
figures
of
the
four
appearing
upon
the
six
minutes
later
ping
had
sailed
innocently
into
vendôme
and
up
to
her
doom
the
vendôme
police
could
hardly
believe
their
eyes
here
was
the
offending
car
corresponding
in
every
particular
to
the
one
described
to
them
admittedly
fresh
from
châteaudun
yet
having
covered
the
kilometres
in
eleven
minutes
it
was
amazing
almost
incredible
almost
of
outlaws
however
all
things
were
credible
even
a
speed
of
one
hundred
and
miles
an
hour
for
it
was
without
doubt
that
outlaw
which
had
flouted
authority
at
châteaudun
oh
indubitably
and
having
thus
flouted
authority
what
was
more
natural
than
that
it
should
endeavour
to
outstrip
the
consequences
of
its
deed
but
what
wickedness
in
vain
had
jonah
protested
and
daphne
declared
their
innocence
the
telephone
was
again
requisitioned
and
the
summoned
and
as
luck
would
have
it
he
could
not
speak
to
the
passengers
beyond
affirming
that
they
included
one
man
and
one
woman
when
he
gratuitously
added
that
the
reason
why
he
could
not
swear
to
the
whole
of
the
number
was
because
of
the
terrible
pace
at
which
the
car
was
moving
the
game
was
up
finding
that
the
accusation
of
travelling
at
a
horrifying
speed
was
assuming
a
serious
look
my
sister
and
cousins
at
length
decided
that
they
had
no
alternative
but
to
give
us
away
they
had
of
course
realised
that
pong
was
implicated
from
the
beginning
consequently
with
the
flourish
of
one
who
has
hit
upon
the
solution
of
a
problem
they
divulged
our
existence
they
were
politely
but
wholly
disbelieved
in
reply
they
had
politely
but
confidently
invited
the
police
to
wait
and
see
for
over
four
hours
they
had
anxiously
awaited
the
arrival
of
pong
when
at
last
the
humiliating
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
them
and
it
became
evident
that
we
had
ruled
vendôme
out
of
our
itinerary
the
shock
of
realising
not
only
that
they
were
to
be
denied
an
opportunity
of
refuting
the
charges
preferred
but
that
they
were
destined
to
leave
the
town
branded
as
three
of
the
biggest
and
most
unsuccessful
liars
ever
encountered
had
reduced
daphne
and
jill
to
tears
and
when
upon
the
sickly
resumption
of
negotiations
it
appeared
highly
probable
that
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
proceed
jill
had
wept
openly
france
is
nothing
if
not
emotional
visibly
affected
by
her
distress
the
police
had
immediately
become
less
hostile
observing
this
daphne
had
discreetly
followed
her
cousin
example
before
the
blows
of
their
lamentation
two
gendarmes
began
to
sniff
and
a
third
broke
down
the
girls
redoubled
their
sobs
they
were
practically
there
you
never
saw
anything
like
it
concluded
jonah
within
three
minutes
four
of
the
police
were
crying
and
the
head
was
beating
his
breast
and
imploring
me
in
broken
accents
to
explain
away
my
guilt
i
threw
five
hundred
francs
on
his
desk
and
covered
my
eyes
with
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
he
pushed
the
notes
under
a
and
wrote
laboriously
upon
a
buff
sheet
then
a
woman
was
produced
between
explosions
of
distress
she
made
us
some
tea
in
common
decency
we
could
push
off
for
a
while
besides
i
quite
sure
that
it
was
all
over
however
everybody
seemed
too
overcome
to
say
anything
so
after
a
bit
we
chanced
it
and
made
a
move
for
the
car
to
my
relief
they
actually
helped
us
in
and
two
of
them
fought
as
to
who
should
start
us
up
he
looked
round
coldly
and
now
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
what
we
been
punished
for
i
told
what
there
was
to
tell
as
i
came
to
the
end
berry
nodded
at
jonah
yes
he
said
unctuously
and
let
this
be
a
lesson
to
you
brother
speechless
with
indignation
our
cousin
regarded
him
at
length
what
mean
he
demanded
berry
raised
his
eyebrows
i
hardly
think
he
said
the
penalty
for
er
loitering
would
have
been
so
vindictive
chapter
ii
how
three
wagers
were
made
and
adèle
killed
two
birds
with
one
stone
we
had
slept
risen
and
breakfasted
we
had
visited
tours
cathedral
finally
we
had
mustered
in
the
lounge
of
the
hotel
it
was
when
we
had
there
been
insulting
one
another
for
nearly
an
hour
that
jonah
looked
at
his
watch
we
have
now
he
said
wasted
exactly
minutes
in
kicking
against
the
pricks
short
of
a
european
war
you
ca
alter
the
geography
of
france
and
the
laws
of
mathematics
take
a
lot
of
upsetting
it
no
good
wishing
that
bordeaux
was
biarritz
or
that
pau
was
half
the
distance
it
is
from
angoulême
if
you
do
want
to
go
right
through
you
must
stay
at
bordeaux
it
the
only
possible
place
if
you
do
want
to
stay
at
bordeaux
you
must
go
right
through
i
do
care
which
we
do
but
i
do
want
to
see
something
of
poitiers
and
if
we
do
get
a
move
on
we
sha
have
time
all
the
way
from
boulogne
france
had
made
an
excellent
host
so
far
she
had
never
failed
to
offer
us
a
good
night
lodging
with
history
as
a
bedfellow
at
the
end
of
a
respectable
run
indeed
from
the
point
of
view
of
they
that
go
down
to
the
south
in
cars
her
famous
capitals
could
hardly
have
been
more
conveniently
disposed
this
very
evening
by
lodging
us
at
angoulême
she
was
to
repeat
such
hospitality
for
the
last
time
upon
the
morrow
we
should
be
faced
with
a
choice
of
making
a
dash
for
the
villa
which
was
awaiting
our
arrival
at
pau
or
breaking
the
journey
asunder
but
by
no
means
in
half
by
sleeping
at
bordeaux
i
must
confess
said
daphne
that
for
some
reason
or
other
bordeaux
does
attract
me
incidentally
i
getting
rather
tired
of
unpacking
and
packing
up
so
far
said
her
husband
as
the
bestowal
and
disinterment
of
my
effects
are
concerned
i
can
confirm
that
statement
indeed
if
we
had
another
week
on
the
road
you
both
be
exhausted
you
left
my
sponge
and
at
boulogne
my
at
rouen
and
my
pyjamas
at
chartres
i
wish
you
tell
me
what
you
left
here
simply
dying
to
know
no
said
daphne
you
must
wait
till
angoulême
i
would
spoil
it
for
anything
jade
said
her
husband
and
now
stand
back
please
everybody
i
want
to
do
a
little
with
that
from
every
pocket
he
produced
french
notes
of
all
denominations
in
all
stages
of
decay
and
heaped
them
upon
the
table
now
this
one
he
added
gingerly
extracting
a
filthy
and
dilapidated
rag
is
a
particularly
interesting
specimen
apparently
upon
close
inspection
merely
a
valuable
security
worth
to
be
exact
a
shade
under
it
is
in
reality
a
talisman
whosoever
touches
it
can
not
fail
to
contract
at
least
two
contagious
diseases
within
the
week
in
view
of
the
temperature
of
my
coffee
this
morning
i
saving
it
for
the
when
said
i
do
you
expect
to
go
down
the
pure
in
heart
said
berry
are
proof
against
its
malignity
do
you
come
too
near
and
look
at
this
sere
and
yellow
leaf
now
that
represents
one
franc
when
i
think
that
upon
offering
that
to
a
i
shall
not
only
not
be
assaulted
but
shall
actually
receive
a
large
bottle
of
beer
and
be
lent
a
glass
from
which
to
imbibe
the
same
i
feel
the
deepest
reverence
for
the
french
government
no
other
authority
in
the
world
could
possibly
put
up
such
a
bluff
and
get
away
with
it
they
are
awful
said
jill
peering
they
perfectly
beastly
said
berry
and
wholly
ridiculous
however
since
they
also
legal
tender
i
suppose
i
may
as
well
try
and
sort
them
out
what
i
really
need
is
some
rubber
gloves
and
a
hullo
just
catch
that
one
will
you
he
seen
that
dog
over
there
you
know
i
not
at
all
sure
that
they
get
enough
air
in
my
pocket
i
suppose
we
could
get
a
hutch
for
the
more
advanced
ones
i
mean
i
do
want
to
be
cruel
again
jonah
looked
at
his
watch
we
have
now
he
said
wasted
minutes
in
excuse
me
said
berry
but
is
this
touching
here
affectionate
albert
with
the
words
he
laid
a
note
tenderly
upon
my
sleeve
now
i
bet
you
do
get
him
off
without
tearing
him
disgustedly
i
managed
to
detach
albert
who
instantly
adhered
to
my
fingers
there
was
a
shriek
of
laughter
stick
to
him
said
berry
i
lost
the
bet
the
injunction
was
unnecessary
after
albert
had
clung
once
to
adèle
happily
gloved
fingers
and
twice
to
each
of
my
hands
i
trod
upon
him
some
of
albert
was
still
upon
my
boot
that
evening
at
angoulême
for
the
last
time
said
jonah
i
appeal
to
you
all
to
let
that
mountebank
rake
over
his
and
attend
to
me
my
addressed
adèle
it
is
he
said
a
discreditable
but
incontrovertible
fact
that
saints
have
always
been
reviled
i
suppose
it
jealousy
he
turned
to
his
wife
by
the
way
did
you
pack
my
i
left
it
hanging
on
the
if
said
daphne
you
referring
to
your
it
with
your
and
why
not
between
your
flannel
vests
said
her
husband
the
grey
ones
we
found
at
margate
i
mean
with
the
imitation
bone
buttons
ah
here
we
are
now
if
half
a
franc
no
earthly
what
who
give
me
for
of
fifty
centimes
jonah
sank
into
a
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
look
here
said
i
desperately
once
for
all
are
we
going
to
stay
at
bordeaux
or
are
we
going
right
through
i
think
we
all
rather
go
right
through
said
jill
i
know
i
would
said
her
brother
and
if
boy
leg
was
all
right
i
should
hesitate
i
answer
for
ping
but
frankly
with
berry
driving
i
doubt
if
pong
fetch
up
i
mean
two
hundred
and
miles
takes
some
biting
off
there
was
a
pregnant
silence
then
he
never
do
it
said
daphne
her
husband
who
was
still
busy
with
his
paper
looked
up
defiantly
then
he
took
a
note
and
laid
it
apart
from
its
fellows
upon
the
table
i
will
wager
that
shekel
he
said
deliberately
that
with
a
start
of
one
hour
pong
reaches
pau
before
ping
there
was
a
gasp
of
astonishment
done
said
jonah
what
more
i
bet
you
another
you
do
get
in
before
ten
berry
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
an
insult
he
said
never
mind
your
dross
shall
wipe
it
out
i
take
you
and
i
said
i
not
to
be
outdone
will
put
another
on
pong
for
the
double
i
felt
that
my
honour
was
involved
after
all
if
i
had
not
trained
the
mount
i
was
training
the
jockey
right
said
jonah
will
you
both
pay
me
now
or
wait
till
out
of
hospital
i
think
said
i
we
have
a
run
for
our
money
the
bets
were
made
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
but
when
we
were
again
in
the
car
and
my
was
threading
his
way
out
of
tours
i
began
to
repent
my
rashness
considering
that
when
he
took
the
wheel
at
boulogne
berry
had
had
only
three
lessons
in
the
management
of
a
car
he
had
done
most
creditably
my
was
no
fool
moreover
on
leaving
rouen
he
and
i
had
joined
forces
sitting
beside
him
in
the
coupé
i
had
driven
the
car
with
his
hands
after
a
little
practice
with
astonishing
results
in
two
days
we
had
we
prided
ourselves
raised
such
collaboration
from
the
ranks
of
the
mechanical
to
the
society
of
the
fine
arts
my
part
was
comparatively
easy
sinking
his
initiative
he
had
more
nearly
converted
himself
into
an
intelligent
piece
of
mechanism
than
i
would
have
believed
possible
it
would
of
course
be
vain
to
suggest
that
pong
would
not
have
gone
faster
if
i
had
been
able
to
drive
with
my
own
hands
or
berry
had
had
my
experience
still
we
had
come
very
well
and
with
a
start
of
a
whole
hour
and
a
little
luck
another
point
in
our
favour
was
that
adèle
who
with
nobby
completed
our
crew
had
a
pronounced
gift
for
she
had
an
eye
to
country
she
seemed
to
be
able
to
scent
the
line
we
ought
to
take
the
frequent
treachery
of
signposts
she
laughed
to
scorn
upon
the
morrow
her
confident
assistance
would
be
invaluable
what
when
i
made
my
bet
i
had
entirely
forgotten
was
that
we
were
not
always
upon
the
open
road
there
was
the
rub
from
angoulême
to
pau
towns
would
have
to
be
penetrated
among
them
bordeaux
itself
and
in
the
towns
our
system
had
broken
down
in
a
crowded
street
though
i
could
still
administer
berry
could
not
execute
when
i
endeavoured
to
allow
for
his
inexperience
of
traffic
i
found
it
impossible
accurately
to
gauge
his
capabilities
after
a
failure
or
two
it
had
been
agreed
that
he
should
negotiate
such
streets
as
we
encountered
without
my
interference
of
my
haste
to
support
pong
honour
i
had
forgotten
the
towns
with
years
of
practice
behind
us
jonah
and
i
could
thrust
through
traffic
happy
enough
with
an
odd
inch
to
spare
naturally
enough
berry
had
no
such
confidence
an
inch
was
of
no
use
to
him
he
must
have
a
good
ell
and
more
also
before
he
would
enter
a
gap
in
the
trough
of
a
narrow
street
he
laboured
heavily
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
towns
through
which
we
should
have
to
pass
on
wednesday
would
settle
our
chances
my
money
was
as
good
as
gone
it
seemed
equally
probable
that
berry
would
save
his
stake
barring
accidents
of
the
grosser
sort
if
we
started
betimes
we
were
bound
to
reach
pau
before
ten
such
a
protasis
robbed
the
bet
of
its
savour
with
a
thousand
francs
at
stake
it
would
be
foolish
not
to
take
reasonable
care
and
the
taking
of
reasonable
care
would
all
but
eliminate
the
element
of
uncertainty
there
was
no
getting
away
from
it
of
the
two
wagers
only
the
first
was
worth
winning
to
reach
pau
before
jonah
would
be
a
veritable
triumph
moodily
i
communicated
my
reflections
to
adèle
i
thought
it
was
rather
rash
at
the
time
she
replied
but
i
think
there
a
sporting
chance
that
right
said
berry
put
your
money
on
uncle
with
enough
encouragement
i
can
do
anything
permit
me
to
encourage
you
to
blow
your
horn
said
i
that
child
in
front
of
you
is
too
young
to
die
my
obeyed
all
the
same
i
afraid
we
for
it
it
is
so
much
a
question
of
pace
pure
and
simple
for
jonah
a
careful
driver
but
his
street
work
is
beautiful
berry
sighed
i
suppose
he
pass
between
those
two
waggons
he
said
sarcastically
he
would
said
i
i
do
think
you
quite
see
where
i
mean
said
berry
pointing
i
mean
along
that
temporary
passage
which
would
admit
a
small
perambulator
as
he
spoke
ping
brushed
past
us
slipped
between
the
two
wains
and
disappeared
berry
stared
after
it
in
silence
at
length
i
withdraw
he
said
i
not
a
conjurer
if
everybody
stood
well
back
i
used
to
be
able
to
produce
an
egg
broken
or
unbroken
according
to
the
temperature
of
my
hands
from
a
handkerchief
about
six
feet
square
people
were
very
nice
about
it
very
nice
but
an
inability
to
introduce
a
quart
into
a
pint
pot
has
always
been
among
my
failings
do
say
i
got
to
turn
to
the
left
here
because
i
ca
bear
it
no
said
adèle
smiling
straight
on
what
past
the
steam
roller
how
very
touching
excuse
me
messieurs
but
would
you
mind
suspending
your
somewhat
boisterous
my
little
car
is
frightened
no
answer
i
suppose
i
must
pass
it
or
shall
we
turn
back
you
know
i
did
really
half
see
the
cathedral
go
on
i
said
mercilessly
jam
your
foot
on
the
accelerator
and
shut
your
eyes
oh
and
you
might
hold
nobby
a
minute
will
you
i
want
to
light
a
cigarette
adèle
began
to
shake
with
laughter
with
pleasure
said
berry
acidly
and
then
i
help
you
on
with
your
coat
i
may
say
that
if
you
touch
me
with
that
mammal
i
shall
press
and
pull
everything
i
can
see
and
burst
into
tears
i
all
strung
up
i
am
there
was
not
much
room
and
the
roller
was
ponderously
closing
in
but
with
a
protruding
tongue
our
luckless
chauffeur
crept
slowly
past
the
monster
in
safety
and
a
moment
later
we
were
scudding
up
the
poitiers
road
now
that
we
were
clear
of
the
town
we
set
to
work
diligently
adèle
pored
over
the
map
and
the
michelin
guide
berry
turned
himself
into
a
mechanical
doll
and
i
maintained
a
steady
issue
of
orders
until
my
throat
was
sore
the
weather
was
fair
and
the
going
was
good
her
stiffness
beginning
to
wear
off
pong
went
better
than
ever
berry
excelled
himself
with
every
kilometre
we
covered
my
spirits
rose
and
when
we
overtook
jonah
on
the
outskirts
of
chatellerault
i
could
have
flung
up
my
cap
the
latter
was
clearly
immensely
surprised
to
see
us
and
when
we
stopped
as
was
our
custom
at
a
to
buy
our
lunch
and
ping
had
followed
our
example
leaned
out
of
his
window
and
asked
me
pointedly
whether
my
leg
was
yet
stiff
concealing
a
smile
i
regretted
that
it
was
jonah
fingered
his
chin
of
course
he
said
warily
it
a
condition
precedent
that
you
drive
of
course
i
agreed
the
confession
of
uneasiness
however
did
my
heart
good
it
was
plain
that
my
imperturbable
cousin
was
getting
nervous
as
we
moved
off
again
we
must
lunch
soon
said
berry
my
mouth
watering
so
fast
i
ca
keep
up
with
it
i
patted
adèle
arm
now
you
know
the
way
to
his
heart
i
said
straight
through
the
stomach
and
but
how
gross
said
berry
and
how
untrue
naturally
ascetic
but
for
the
insistence
of
my
physicians
i
should
long
ago
have
let
my
hair
grow
and
subsisted
entirely
on
locusts
and
motionless
lemonade
but
a
harsh
fate
ruled
otherwise
excuse
me
but
i
think
that
that
there
basket
or
ark
in
which
the
comfort
is
enshrined
is
rather
near
the
conduit
through
which
flows
that
sparkling
liquid
which
when
vapoured
supplies
our
motive
power
and
is
notoriously
susceptible
to
the
baneful
influence
of
neighbouring
perfumes
thank
you
if
those
bits
of
heaven
were
to
taste
of
petrol
it
would
shorten
my
life
and
now
where
was
i
i
turned
to
adèle
he
off
said
i
the
prospect
of
gluttony
always
loosens
his
tongue
there
really
only
one
way
to
stop
him
what
about
lunching
at
the
top
of
this
hill
or
can
you
bear
it
till
we
passed
poitiers
a
mischievous
look
came
into
adèle
brown
eyes
it
not
twelve
yet
she
said
slowly
my
groaned
still
i
do
know
after
all
we
did
have
breakfast
rather
early
did
we
berry
smacked
his
lips
a
sensible
woman
he
said
is
above
boobies
as
he
spoke
ping
swept
by
stormily
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
hurray
cried
adèle
excitedly
we
got
a
rise
it
was
patently
true
jonah
was
wishful
to
reassure
himself
upon
a
point
which
an
hour
ago
he
had
taken
for
granted
the
reflection
that
at
the
moment
we
had
not
been
trying
to
outdistance
him
increased
our
delight
all
the
same
his
ability
to
us
was
unquestionable
but
whether
he
could
give
us
the
start
he
had
agreed
to
was
another
matter
we
ate
a
festive
lunch
an
hour
with
poitiers
is
like
a
sip
of
old
wine
the
absence
of
the
stir
and
bustle
which
fret
her
sister
capitals
is
notable
so
reverend
and
thoughtful
is
the
old
town
that
it
is
hard
to
recognise
the
bristling
that
bestrode
the
toughest
centuries
snarled
in
the
face
of
fate
and
pulled
down
time
the
old
soldier
has
got
him
a
cassock
and
become
a
dominie
the
sleepy
music
of
bells
calling
the
pensive
air
of
study
the
odour
of
simple
piety
the
sober
confidence
of
great
possessions
are
most
impressive
poitiers
has
beaten
her
swords
into
crosiers
and
her
spears
into
never
was
there
an
old
age
so
ripe
so
mellow
so
becoming
with
this
for
evidence
you
may
look
history
in
the
eyes
and
swear
that
you
have
seen
poitiers
in
the
prime
of
her
full
life
the
dead
will
turn
in
their
graves
to
hear
you
children
unborn
will
say
you
knew
no
better
and
poitiers
will
take
the
threefold
compliment
with
a
grave
smile
she
has
heard
it
so
often
celt
roman
visigoth
moor
englishman
all
these
have
held
poitiers
in
turn
proud
of
their
tenure
lest
history
should
forget
three
at
least
of
them
have
set
up
their
boasts
in
stone
the
place
was
i
imagine
a
favourite
kings
used
her
certainly
dread
harry
plantagenet
gave
her
a
proud
cathedral
among
her
orchards
coeur
de
lion
worshipped
jehane
jousted
sang
of
a
summer
evening
and
spent
his
happiest
days
beneath
her
shadow
the
black
prince
lighted
such
a
candle
of
chivalry
as
has
never
yet
been
put
out
not
without
honour
of
her
own
countrymen
for
thirteen
years
the
high
court
of
parliament
preferred
her
to
paris
within
her
walls
the
sainted
joan
argued
her
inspiration
i
have
dived
at
random
into
her
wallet
yet
see
what
i
have
brought
forth
if
memories
are
precious
poitiers
is
uncommon
rich
as
if
to
console
us
for
our
departure
the
road
to
sister
angoulême
was
superb
broad
straight
smooth
as
any
floor
the
great
highway
stretched
like
a
strip
of
marquetry
inlaid
upon
the
countryside
its
invitation
was
irresistible
we
reached
the
windy
town
in
time
for
a
late
tea
as
soon
as
this
was
over
berry
and
i
escaped
and
carried
pong
off
to
a
garage
there
to
be
oiled
and
greased
against
the
morrow
race
somewhat
to
our
amusement
before
we
had
been
there
ten
minutes
our
cousin
arrived
with
ping
and
the
same
object
had
the
incident
occurred
at
poitiers
i
should
have
been
encouraged
as
well
it
was
another
sign
that
jonah
did
not
despise
his
opponents
and
his
opinion
was
worth
having
as
it
was
the
compliment
left
me
unmoved
the
truth
was
berry
had
that
afternoon
contracted
two
habits
again
and
again
on
the
way
from
poitiers
he
had
shown
a
marked
tendency
to
choke
his
engine
and
five
times
he
had
failed
to
mesh
the
gears
when
changing
speed
twice
we
had
had
to
stop
altogether
and
start
again
he
had
of
course
reproached
himself
violently
and
i
had
made
light
of
the
matter
but
for
all
the
comfort
i
offered
him
i
was
seriously
alarmed
in
a
word
his
sudden
lapse
suggested
that
my
was
entering
that
most
unpleasant
stage
which
must
be
traversed
by
all
who
will
become
chauffeurs
and
are
taught
so
to
speak
to
run
before
they
can
walk
it
was
after
we
had
dined
and
when
my
wife
and
i
were
seated
myself
by
virtue
of
my
injury
upon
a
couch
and
she
upon
a
cushion
beside
me
before
the
comfort
of
a
glowing
that
adèle
laid
down
the
guide
and
leaned
her
head
against
my
knee
i
glad
i
married
you
she
said
i
looked
at
nobby
so
are
we
both
said
i
i
wonder
said
adèle
whether
you
are
really
or
whether
you
just
being
nice
personally
i
just
being
nice
nobby
is
really
of
course
he
may
be
making
the
best
of
a
bad
job
as
a
worldly
good
of
mine
i
just
endowed
you
with
him
and
that
was
that
you
were
both
very
happy
before
before
i
came
we
thought
we
were
said
adèle
twisting
her
head
around
to
see
my
face
you
were
you
know
you
were
the
gleeful
accusation
of
the
soft
brown
eyes
was
irresistible
to
gain
time
i
swallowed
then
so
were
you
i
said
desperately
i
know
i
was
was
the
disconcerting
reply
well
then
why
should
we
but
you
said
you
were
i
called
the
sealyham
nobby
said
i
i
being
bullied
the
woman
we
love
is
turning
my
words
against
me
for
a
moment
the
dog
looked
at
us
then
he
sat
up
and
begged
and
what
said
adèle
caressing
him
does
that
mean
he
pleading
my
cause
obviously
i
not
so
sure
said
adèle
i
wish
he
could
talk
you
a
wicked
suspicious
girl
here
are
two
miserable
males
all
pale
and
trembling
for
love
of
you
you
only
got
to
smile
to
make
them
rich
and
you
set
your
small
pink
heel
upon
their
devotion
i
admit
it
a
soft
heel
one
of
the
very
softest
i
ever
remember
flashed
adèle
how
very
interesting
i
have
held
by
wild
oats
were
the
others
pink
too
solemnly
i
regarded
her
a
little
more
said
i
and
i
sha
teach
her
to
drive
adèle
tossed
her
head
berry
going
to
do
that
she
said
directly
we
get
to
pau
i
laughed
savagely
i
talking
of
automobiles
i
said
not
golf
balls
i
know
said
my
wife
and
berry
going
to
well
he
not
i
shouted
for
one
thing
he
ca
and
for
another
it
my
right
and
i
wo
give
it
up
i
been
looking
forward
to
it
ever
since
i
knew
you
i
dreamed
about
it
miles
cleverer
than
i
am
you
wise
you
you
can
play
you
can
sing
like
a
nightingale
you
can
take
me
on
at
tennis
you
can
ride
driving
a
car
about
the
only
thing
i
can
teach
you
and
adèle
laid
a
smooth
hand
upon
my
mouth
nobby
and
i
she
said
are
very
proud
of
you
they
not
in
the
same
street
with
their
master
they
know
but
they
awfully
proud
to
be
his
wife
and
dog
to
such
preposterous
generosity
there
was
but
one
answer
as
i
made
it
may
i
teach
you
to
drive
lady
a
look
came
into
the
soft
brown
eyes
if
you
do
said
adèle
nobody
shall
the
day
of
the
race
dawned
clear
and
jubilant
by
eight
the
sun
was
high
in
a
blue
heaven
by
a
steady
breeze
limping
into
the
courtyard
before
breakfast
i
rejoiced
to
notice
that
the
air
was
appreciably
warmer
than
any
i
had
breathed
for
a
month
we
had
hoped
to
leave
angoulême
at
nine
actually
it
was
a
quarter
to
ten
before
the
luggage
was
finally
strapped
into
place
and
my
climbed
into
the
car
with
a
sigh
for
a
bad
beginning
i
reflected
that
if
we
could
not
cover
the
and
twenty
odd
miles
in
twelve
and
a
quarter
hours
we
ought
to
be
shot
jonah
stood
by
watch
in
hand
are
you
ready
he
said
i
nodded
right
said
my
cousin
i
not
sure
we
picked
the
best
route
but
it
too
late
now
no
divergence
allowed
i
agree
and
you
do
drive
it
out
of
the
question
right
like
to
double
the
bets
no
said
adèle
they
would
i
wo
allow
it
but
i
bet
with
you
i
ca
afford
much
but
i
bet
you
a
hundred
francs
there
before
you
i
give
you
tens
said
my
cousin
and
i
start
in
one
hour
from
when
i
say
that
upon
the
word
being
given
pong
whose
manners
had
been
hitherto
above
reproach
utterly
refused
to
start
or
be
started
it
will
be
seen
that
fate
was
against
us
it
took
us
exactly
two
minutes
to
locate
the
trouble
which
was
in
the
magneto
and
just
over
two
hours
to
put
it
right
as
we
slid
out
of
angoulême
an
impatient
clock
announced
that
it
was
at
least
the
delay
had
done
something
so
far
as
the
second
wager
was
concerned
it
had
altered
the
whole
complexion
of
the
case
we
were
no
longer
betting
upon
anything
approaching
a
certainty
indeed
unless
we
could
break
the
back
of
the
distance
before
daylight
failed
our
chances
of
reaching
pau
before
ten
were
worth
little
if
the
road
to
bordeaux
were
as
fine
as
that
from
poitiers
and
berry
could
find
his
form
we
should
probably
run
to
time
we
could
not
afford
however
to
give
a
minute
away
as
luck
would
have
it
the
state
of
the
road
was
on
the
whole
rather
worse
than
any
we
had
used
since
we
left
boulogne
presumably
untouched
for
over
six
years
the
wear
and
tear
to
which
as
one
of
the
arteries
springing
from
a
great
port
it
had
been
subjected
had
turned
a
sleek
highway
into
a
shadow
of
itself
there
was
no
flesh
the
skin
was
broken
the
very
bones
were
staring
for
the
first
half
hour
we
told
one
another
that
we
had
struck
a
bad
patch
for
the
second
we
expressed
nervous
hopes
that
the
going
would
grow
no
worse
after
that
berry
and
i
lost
interest
and
suffered
in
silence
indeed
but
for
adèle
i
think
we
should
have
thrown
up
the
sponge
and
spent
the
night
at
bordeaux
my
lady
however
kept
us
both
going
she
had
studied
our
route
until
she
knew
it
by
heart
and
was
just
burning
to
pilot
us
through
bordeaux
and
thence
across
gascony
they
sure
to
make
mistakes
after
bordeaux
you
know
what
the
are
like
and
the
road
really
tricky
but
i
spent
two
hours
looking
it
up
yesterday
evening
i
took
you
through
barbezieux
all
right
did
i
like
a
book
darling
well
i
can
do
that
every
time
and
i
daresay
they
have
tire
trouble
besides
the
road
no
worse
for
us
than
it
is
for
them
and
after
bordeaux
it
probably
be
splendid
of
course
we
be
there
before
ten
we
ca
help
it
i
want
to
be
there
before
jonah
got
a
hundred
my
dear
i
expostulated
i
do
want
to
we
got
a
jolly
good
chance
any
way
while
you
were
getting
her
right
i
got
the
lunch
and
we
can
eat
that
without
stopping
you
can
feed
berry
we
gain
half
an
hour
like
that
before
such
optimism
i
had
not
the
face
to
point
out
that
if
our
opponents
had
any
sense
at
all
they
had
lunched
before
leaving
angoulême
here
a
nice
patch
added
adèle
put
her
along
you
two
spurred
by
her
enthusiasm
we
bent
again
to
the
oars
contrary
to
my
expectation
my
if
unusually
silent
was
driving
well
but
the
road
was
against
him
he
had
not
sufficient
experience
to
be
able
to
keep
his
foot
steady
upon
the
accelerator
when
a
high
speed
and
a
rude
surface
conspired
to
dislodge
it
a
shortcoming
which
caused
us
all
three
much
discomfort
and
lost
a
lot
of
mileage
then
again
i
dared
not
let
him
drive
too
close
to
the
side
of
the
road
right
at
the
edge
the
surface
was
well
preserved
and
i
knew
that
jonah
off
wheels
would
make
good
use
of
it
such
finesse
however
was
out
of
berry
reach
we
pelted
along
upon
what
remained
of
the
crown
painfully
miles
separate
bordeaux
from
angoulême
and
at
the
end
of
two
hours
of
them
lay
behind
us
all
things
considered
this
was
extremely
good
and
when
adèle
suggested
that
we
should
eat
our
lunch
i
agreed
quite
cheerfully
the
suggestion
however
that
i
should
feed
berry
proved
impracticable
after
four
endeavours
to
introduce
one
end
of
a
into
his
mouth
would
it
be
asking
too
much
said
my
if
i
suggested
that
you
should
suspend
this
assault
i
do
know
what
part
of
your
face
you
eat
with
but
i
usually
use
my
mouth
i
admit
it
a
bit
of
a
rosebud
but
that
no
excuse
for
all
these
yes
i
know
a
scream
but
i
was
once
told
never
to
put
upon
the
nose
or
cheeks
they
say
it
draws
the
skin
oh
and
do
let
have
any
comic
nonsense
about
the
beer
he
added
shortly
pour
it
straight
into
my
and
have
done
with
it
then
i
can
suck
my
handkerchief
as
he
spoke
nobby
leaned
forward
and
took
the
dishevelled
sandwich
out
of
my
unready
fingers
that
right
added
berry
with
the
laugh
of
a
maniac
cast
my
portion
to
the
dogs
he
dabbed
his
face
with
a
handkerchief
never
mind
when
his
hour
comes
you
have
to
hold
him
out
of
the
window
i
not
going
to
stop
every
time
he
wants
to
be
sick
eventually
it
was
decided
that
since
we
should
have
to
stop
for
petrol
berry
must
seize
that
opportunity
to
devour
some
food
besides
i
concluded
a
rest
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
will
do
you
good
as
the
words
left
my
mouth
i
noticed
for
the
first
time
that
my
was
tiring
for
the
moment
i
thought
i
was
mistaken
for
upon
our
previous
runs
he
had
never
turned
a
hair
now
however
he
seemed
to
be
driving
with
an
effort
as
if
to
confirm
my
suspicions
at
the
very
next
hill
he
missed
his
change
i
think
i
said
quickly
you
ought
to
have
your
lunch
right
away
it
no
good
getting
done
in
for
want
of
food
berry
shot
me
a
pathetic
glance
it
is
that
old
chap
it
hang
it
all
it
my
shoulder
that
cursed
muscular
rheumatism
cropped
up
again
yesterday
the
murder
was
out
after
a
little
he
admitted
that
ever
since
we
had
left
poitiers
any
quick
movement
of
his
left
arm
had
caused
him
intense
pain
of
course
both
adèle
and
i
besought
him
to
stop
there
and
then
and
let
the
race
go
to
blazes
of
this
he
would
not
hear
declaring
that
so
long
as
jonah
was
behind
victory
was
not
out
of
sight
and
that
nothing
short
of
paralysis
would
induce
him
to
jilt
the
jade
after
a
little
argument
we
let
him
have
his
way
the
road
continued
to
offer
an
abominable
passage
and
when
we
stopped
at
a
garage
in
bordeaux
it
was
five
minutes
to
three
of
a
beautiful
afternoon
the
third
bidon
was
discharging
its
contents
into
pong
tank
and
berry
was
sitting
wearily
upon
the
with
his
mouth
full
and
a
glass
of
beer
in
his
hand
when
with
an
apologetic
cough
ping
emerged
from
behind
an
approaching
tram
and
slid
past
us
over
the
cobbles
with
a
smooth
rush
the
window
was
open
and
as
the
car
went
by
jonah
waved
to
us
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
my
cousin
was
out
to
win
it
was
also
transparently
clear
that
adèle
and
i
at
any
rate
had
lost
our
money
we
could
not
compete
with
an
average
of
miles
an
hour
boy
yes
darling
is
that
the
last
yes
but
berry
wo
have
finished
for
at
least
ten
minutes
besides
could
i
drive
for
a
bit
just
till
he
finished
his
lunch
i
stared
at
my
wife
then
i
do
see
why
you
should
dear
except
that
the
streets
of
bordeaux
are
rather
rough
on
a
beginner
i
be
very
careful
pleaded
adèle
and
and
after
all
we
shall
be
moving
and
it
ca
affect
the
bets
nothing
was
said
about
berry
having
to
drive
i
smiled
ruefully
as
far
as
the
bets
are
concerned
we
might
as
well
stay
here
the
night
we
got
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
in
front
of
us
and
seven
hours
five
of
them
after
dark
to
do
them
in
berry
shoulder
has
put
the
lid
on
we
sha
get
in
before
midnight
you
never
know
said
adèle
berry
suspended
the
process
of
mastication
to
put
his
oar
in
let
her
drive
he
said
huskily
one
thing
certain
she
ca
do
any
worse
than
i
have
you
never
know
said
adèle
a
minute
later
she
was
in
the
driver
seat
and
i
had
folded
the
rug
and
placed
it
behind
her
back
as
berry
took
his
seat
that
right
i
said
now
let
in
the
clutch
gently
well
done
change
good
girl
now
i
should
try
to
pass
this
lorry
until
i
think
you
would
said
adèle
changing
into
third
and
darting
in
front
of
the
monster
good
heavens
i
cried
then
look
out
for
that
tram
lady
better
as
the
tram
was
left
standing
i
caught
my
by
the
arm
can
drive
i
said
stupidly
nonsense
said
berry
i
willing
her
fool
i
shouted
shaking
him
tell
you
she
can
drive
we
flashed
between
two
waggons
at
that
she
a
driver
and
she
going
to
save
your
stake
what
really
worrying
me
said
adèle
is
how
we
to
pass
jonah
without
him
seeing
us
there
was
an
electric
silence
then
yelled
berry
out
of
the
way
fat
face
or
we
take
the
coat
off
your
back
a
portly
frenchman
leaped
into
safety
with
a
scream
that
the
style
fill
the
fife
dear
heart
fill
the
blinkin
fife
there
a
cyciclist
on
the
horizon
to
sound
the
horn
would
have
been
a
work
of
supererogation
maddened
by
our
vociferous
exuberance
nobby
lifted
up
his
voice
and
barked
like
a
demoniac
the
ungodly
hullaballoo
with
which
we
shook
the
dust
of
bordeaux
from
off
our
tires
will
be
remembered
fearfully
by
all
who
witnessed
our
exit
from
that
city
when
i
had
indulged
my
excitement
i
left
the
terrier
and
berry
to
finish
the
latter
lunch
and
turned
to
my
wife
sitting
there
with
her
little
hands
about
the
wheel
she
made
a
bewitching
picture
she
had
thrown
her
fur
coat
open
and
the
breeze
from
the
open
window
was
playing
greedily
with
the
embroidery
about
her
throat
her
soft
hair
too
was
now
at
the
wind
mercy
and
but
for
a
little
suede
hat
which
would
have
suited
rosalind
the
dark
strand
that
lay
flickering
upon
her
cheek
would
have
been
one
of
many
chin
in
air
eyebrows
raised
lids
lowered
the
faintest
of
smiles
hovering
about
her
small
red
mouth
my
lady
leaned
back
with
an
indescribable
air
of
easy
efficiency
which
was
most
attractive
only
the
parted
lips
at
all
betrayed
her
eagerness
i
felt
very
proud
suddenly
the
road
was
vile
but
pong
flew
over
it
without
a
tremor
looking
upon
his
driver
i
found
it
difficult
to
appreciate
that
a
small
foot
i
could
not
see
was
setting
and
maintaining
his
beautiful
steady
pace
as
i
stared
at
her
marvelling
the
smile
deepened
and
a
little
gloved
hand
left
the
wheel
and
stole
into
mine
i
pulled
the
glove
back
and
kissed
the
white
wrist
and
i
was
going
to
teach
you
i
said
humbly
so
was
i
wailed
berry
i
arranged
everything
i
was
going
to
be
so
patient
i
was
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
i
said
wistfully
oh
and
do
you
think
i
was
cried
adèle
it
was
so
dear
of
you
lad
i
was
going
to
pretend
it
was
much
more
dearer
of
me
said
berry
but
then
i
like
that
of
course
he
added
you
ought
to
have
driven
from
boulogne
tell
me
why
you
held
your
peace
because
i
know
and
i
think
it
was
just
sweet
of
you
darling
and
but
for
your
husband
presence
i
should
kiss
you
by
force
the
car
fled
on
there
was
little
traffic
but
thrice
we
came
upon
cows
and
once
upon
a
large
flock
of
sheep
we
could
only
pray
that
jonah
had
endured
the
same
trials
as
we
slid
through
langon
thirty
miles
distant
from
bordeaux
i
looked
at
my
watch
two
minutes
to
four
adèle
noticed
the
movement
and
asked
the
time
when
i
told
her
she
frowned
not
good
enough
she
said
simply
the
light
was
beginning
to
fail
now
and
i
asked
if
she
would
have
the
lamps
lit
she
shook
her
head
not
yet
boy
at
last
the
road
was
presenting
a
better
surface
as
we
flashed
up
a
long
incline
a
glance
at
the
speedometer
showed
me
that
we
were
doing
fifty
as
i
looked
again
the
needle
swung
slowly
to
i
began
to
peer
into
the
distance
for
jonah
dust
with
a
low
snarl
we
swooped
into
la
réole
whipped
unhesitatingly
to
right
and
left
coughed
at
and
then
swept
out
of
the
town
ere
berry
had
found
its
name
in
the
michelin
guide
again
i
asked
my
wife
if
she
would
have
the
headlights
not
yet
boy
shall
i
raise
the
wind
screen
please
together
berry
and
i
observed
her
wish
while
with
her
own
right
hand
she
closed
the
window
the
rush
of
the
cool
air
was
more
than
freshening
and
i
turned
up
her
coat
collar
and
fastened
the
heavy
fur
about
her
throat
the
car
tore
on
lights
began
to
appear
one
by
one
stabbing
the
dusk
with
their
beams
steady
conspicuous
one
only
far
in
the
distance
seemed
a
faint
smudge
against
the
twilight
then
it
went
out
altogether
jonah
said
adèle
quietly
she
was
right
within
a
minute
we
could
see
the
smear
again
more
clearly
it
was
ping
i
began
to
tremble
with
excitement
beside
me
i
could
hear
berry
breathing
fast
through
his
nose
half
a
dozen
times
we
lost
the
light
only
to
pick
it
up
again
a
moment
later
each
time
it
was
brighter
than
before
we
were
gaining
rapidly
we
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
furlong
behind
when
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
cluster
of
bright
immediately
ahead
showed
that
we
were
approaching
marmande
instantly
ping
began
to
grow
bigger
jonah
was
slowing
up
for
the
town
in
a
moment
we
should
be
in
a
position
to
pass
in
silence
berry
and
i
clasped
one
another
somewhere
between
us
nobby
began
to
pant
as
we
entered
marmande
there
were
not
thirty
paces
between
the
two
cars
and
my
unsuspecting
cousin
was
going
dead
slow
a
twitch
of
the
wheel
and
we
should
leave
him
standing
then
without
any
warning
adèle
slowed
up
and
fell
in
behind
ping
i
could
have
screamed
to
her
to
go
by
deliberately
she
was
throwing
away
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
desperately
i
laid
my
hand
on
her
arm
adèle
i
cried
hoarsely
my
darling
are
you
by
way
of
answer
she
gave
a
little
crow
of
rejoicing
and
turned
sharp
round
to
the
right
jonah
had
passed
straight
on
as
pong
leaped
forward
the
scales
fell
from
my
eyes
adèle
was
for
the
if
she
could
only
rejoin
the
main
road
at
a
point
ahead
of
jonah
the
latter
would
never
know
that
we
had
passed
him
if
i
began
to
hope
very
much
that
my
wife
knew
the
plan
of
marmande
rather
better
than
i
through
the
dusk
i
could
see
that
the
street
we
were
using
ran
on
to
a
bridge
it
was
there
i
supposed
that
we
should
turn
to
the
left
to
my
horror
adèle
thrust
on
to
the
bridge
at
an
increased
pace
you
going
to
turn
i
stammered
i
mean
we
never
i
said
the
road
was
tricky
said
adèle
but
i
hardly
dared
to
hope
they
make
such
a
bad
mistake
we
sailed
off
the
bridge
and
on
to
a
beautiful
road
ah
this
is
more
like
it
i
do
know
where
going
this
is
the
way
to
and
now
i
think
it
be
safe
to
have
the
lights
on
you
might
look
behind
first
to
see
if
coming
you
see
if
they
seen
us
go
by
the
game
would
have
been
up
as
it
is
at
seven
that
evening
we
drove
into
pau
arrived
at
our
villa
we
put
the
car
away
and
hurried
indoors
it
was
almost
eight
when
ping
discharged
his
passengers
upon
the
front
steps
in
silence
and
from
the
landing
we
watched
them
enter
the
hall
when
they
were
all
inside
i
released
nobby
chapter
iii
how
a
golden
calf
was
set
up
and
nobby
showed
himself
a
true
prophet
five
fat
weeks
had
rolled
by
since
adèle
had
eased
jonah
of
sixty
pounds
and
the
antoinette
ring
we
had
given
her
to
commemorate
the
feat
was
now
for
the
first
time
in
danger
of
suffering
an
eclipse
in
a
word
a
new
star
had
arisen
i
dreamed
about
it
said
daphne
i
knew
i
should
i
knitted
my
brows
i
wish
said
i
i
could
share
your
enthusiasm
ah
but
you
have
seen
it
i
know
but
i
do
even
want
to
if
you
come
back
raving
about
a
piece
of
furniture
or
a
jewel
or
a
picture
i
should
have
been
interested
but
a
shawl
a
shawl
leaves
me
cold
i
agree
said
jonah
i
learned
to
appear
attentive
to
the
description
of
a
frock
i
keep
a
special
indulgent
smile
for
the
incoherence
inspired
by
a
hat
but
when
you
pipe
to
me
the
praises
of
a
shawl
well
i
unable
to
dance
wait
till
you
see
it
said
adèle
besides
there
were
some
lovely
rugs
that
better
said
i
i
like
a
good
rug
well
these
were
glorious
said
jill
they
had
the
most
lovely
sheen
but
of
course
the
shawl
if
anyone
said
jonah
says
that
ugly
word
again
i
shall
scream
it
was
nine
of
a
very
beautiful
morning
and
we
were
breakfasting
the
last
two
days
had
been
wet
in
the
night
however
the
clouds
had
disappeared
leaving
the
great
sky
flawless
an
atmosphere
so
rare
as
tempted
shy
distance
to
approach
and
the
mountains
in
all
the
powdered
glory
of
their
maiden
snow
seventy
miles
of
magic
that
is
what
pau
stares
at
for
the
pyrenees
viewed
from
this
royal
box
are
purely
magical
they
do
not
rise
so
high
eleven
thousand
feet
as
mountains
go
is
nothing
wonderful
there
is
no
might
nor
majesty
about
them
distant
some
thirty
odd
miles
they
are
just
an
exquisite
wall
well
and
truly
laid
and
carved
with
that
careless
cunning
of
the
great
artificer
into
the
likeness
of
some
screen
in
heaven
where
then
is
the
magic
listen
these
mountains
are
never
the
same
they
are
very
nigh
they
will
stand
farther
than
you
have
ever
seen
them
on
monday
they
will
lie
a
mere
ridge
above
the
on
tuesday
they
will
be
towering
so
that
you
must
lift
up
your
eyes
to
find
the
summits
but
yesterday
you
marvelled
at
their
stablishment
this
morning
they
will
be
floating
above
the
world
one
week
the
beauty
of
their
lines
and
curves
gladdens
your
heart
the
next
a
mocking
mystery
of
soft
blurred
battlements
will
tease
your
vision
such
shifting
sorcery
is
never
stale
light
shade
and
atmosphere
play
such
fantastic
tricks
with
pau
fair
heritage
that
the
grey
town
curled
comfortably
in
the
sunshine
upon
her
plateau
edge
looks
not
on
one
but
upon
many
prospects
the
pageant
of
the
pyrenees
is
never
done
as
for
the
wedding
garment
which
they
had
put
on
in
the
night
it
made
us
all
late
for
breakfast
the
door
opened
to
admit
berry
the
look
of
resignation
upon
his
face
and
the
silence
in
which
he
took
his
seat
where
highly
eloquent
there
was
no
need
to
ask
what
was
the
matter
we
knew
big
with
the
knowledge
we
waited
upon
the
edge
of
laughter
as
he
received
his
coffee
i
not
going
on
like
this
he
said
shortly
it
insanitary
adèle
lips
twitched
and
jill
put
a
hand
to
her
mouth
i
ca
think
how
it
is
said
daphne
mine
was
all
right
of
course
it
was
retorted
her
husband
so
was
adèle
so
was
jill
by
the
time
you
three
nymphs
are
through
there
no
hot
water
left
that
said
i
is
where
the
geyser
comes
in
the
agent
was
at
some
pains
to
point
out
that
it
was
an
auxiliary
was
he
indeed
said
berry
well
if
he
been
at
some
pains
to
point
out
that
it
leaked
stank
became
and
was
generally
about
the
finest
device
ever
invented
he
been
nearer
the
mark
if
he
added
that
it
was
a
geyser
at
all
but
a
cross
between
a
magic
lantern
and
a
knack
said
jonah
that
all
it
needs
you
have
got
the
hang
of
it
yet
the
savagery
with
which
my
attacked
a
roll
was
almost
frightening
said
jill
tremulously
because
said
berry
it
has
to
be
bribed
to
devil
you
until
put
ten
centimes
in
the
metre
you
do
get
any
gas
it
a
pretty
idea
adèle
began
to
shake
with
laughter
you
must
have
done
something
wrong
said
berry
shrugged
his
shoulders
provided
he
said
that
you
are
fairly
active
and
physically
fit
you
ca
go
wrong
but
it
a
strain
on
one
sanity
no
i
think
i
have
any
omelet
they
so
impatient
i
decided
to
apply
the
spur
but
the
agent
showed
us
exactly
look
here
said
berry
you
enter
that
bathroom
clothed
after
a
fashion
and
in
your
right
mind
then
you
leave
it
for
some
matches
on
your
return
you
turn
on
the
gas
after
wasting
four
matches
you
laugh
pleasantly
put
on
your
again
and
go
about
the
house
asking
everyone
for
a
piece
this
you
place
in
the
slot
then
you
go
out
again
and
try
to
remember
where
you
put
the
matches
by
the
time
you
back
the
whole
room
is
full
of
gas
so
you
open
the
window
wide
and
clean
your
teeth
to
fill
up
the
time
long
before
it
safe
you
strike
another
match
the
thing
lights
with
an
explosion
that
shortens
your
life
in
about
two
minutes
it
emits
a
roaring
sound
and
begins
to
shake
all
over
by
now
all
the
taps
are
and
by
the
time
you
burnt
yourself
to
hell
wondering
whether
if
you
start
at
once
you
have
time
to
leave
the
house
before
the
thing
bursts
finally
you
knock
the
gas
off
with
the
cork
mat
after
a
decent
interval
you
start
again
this
time
you
turn
on
the
water
first
stone
cold
of
course
when
you
used
enough
gas
to
roast
an
ox
you
hope
like
anything
and
reduce
the
flow
he
paused
to
pass
a
hand
wearily
across
his
eyes
have
you
ever
seen
vesuvius
in
eruption
he
added
i
admit
no
rocks
were
discharged
at
least
i
did
see
any
there
may
be
some
in
the
bath
i
did
wait
to
look
blinded
by
the
steam
deafened
by
the
noise
you
make
a
rush
for
the
door
this
seems
to
have
been
moved
you
feel
all
over
the
walls
like
a
madman
in
the
frenzy
of
despair
it
astonishing
how
one
clings
to
life
you
hurl
yourself
at
the
bath
and
turn
on
both
taps
as
if
by
magic
the
steam
disappears
the
roaring
subsides
and
two
broad
streams
of
pure
cold
water
issue
like
crystal
founts
into
the
bath
now
you
know
why
i
so
jolly
this
morning
with
tears
running
down
her
cheeks
you
must
have
a
bath
in
the
wailed
daphne
the
others
do
i
wo
said
berry
it
faces
north
then
you
must
have
it
at
night
not
i
interposed
nobby
bagged
it
with
the
laugh
of
a
maniac
my
requested
that
the
facts
should
be
laid
before
the
sealyham
and
the
latter
desired
to
waive
his
rights
of
course
he
concluded
if
you
want
me
to
become
verminous
just
say
so
there
was
a
shriek
of
laughter
and
now
be
quick
said
daphne
or
we
shall
be
late
for
the
meet
and
i
particularly
want
to
see
sally
sarah
featherstone
was
the
possessor
of
the
coveted
shawl
we
had
met
her
by
chance
upon
the
boulevard
two
days
before
no
one
of
us
had
had
any
idea
that
she
was
not
in
ireland
whither
she
had
retired
upon
her
marriage
and
where
her
passion
for
hunting
kept
her
most
of
the
year
and
when
we
learned
that
she
had
already
spent
six
months
in
the
pyrenees
and
would
be
at
pau
all
the
winter
we
could
hardly
believe
our
ears
her
little
son
it
appeared
had
been
ailing
and
the
air
of
the
pyrenees
was
to
make
him
well
so
their
summer
had
been
passed
in
the
mountains
and
with
three
good
hunters
from
ireland
the
winter
was
to
be
supported
under
the
shadow
of
the
healing
hills
it
hurts
me
to
think
of
ireland
but
i
getting
to
love
this
place
i
want
the
rain
on
my
face
sometimes
and
the
earth
does
smell
so
sweet
but
the
sun
a
godsend
i
never
seen
it
before
and
the
air
makes
me
want
to
shout
oh
i
got
a
lot
to
be
thankful
for
peter
put
on
a
stone
and
a
half
to
date
george
be
out
for
christmas
and
now
that
you
come
to
stay
we
were
all
glad
of
sarah
till
yesterday
now
however
she
had
set
up
a
golden
calf
which
our
womenkind
were
worshipping
out
of
all
reason
and
convenience
at
the
mention
of
the
false
prophet
name
jonah
and
i
pushed
back
our
chairs
do
leave
me
said
berry
i
know
what
coming
i
had
it
last
night
until
i
fell
asleep
then
that
harpy
he
nodded
at
daphne
dared
to
rouse
me
out
of
a
most
refreshing
slumber
to
ask
me
whether
i
thought
chinese
did
both
sides
at
once
or
one
after
the
other
with
my
mind
running
on
baths
i
said
they
probably
began
on
their
feet
and
washed
upwards
by
the
time
the
misunderstanding
had
been
cleared
up
i
was
thoroughly
awake
and
remained
in
a
hideous
and
agonising
condition
of
sleepless
lassitude
for
the
space
of
one
hour
the
tea
came
sharp
at
seven
and
the
shawl
rolled
up
twenty
seconds
later
i
tell
you
i
sick
of
the
blasted
comforter
a
squall
of
indignation
succeeded
this
blasphemy
when
order
had
been
restored
any
way
said
jill
sally
says
the
sailor
who
sold
it
her
be
back
with
some
more
things
next
month
and
she
going
to
send
him
here
he
only
comes
twice
a
year
and
is
it
curious
said
jonah
how
a
sailor
never
dies
at
sea
most
strange
said
berry
the
best
way
will
be
to
ask
him
to
stay
here
then
he
can
have
a
bath
in
the
morning
and
we
can
bury
him
behind
the
garage
with
that
confident
accuracy
which
waits
upon
a
player
only
when
it
is
uncourted
jill
cracked
her
ball
across
the
six
yards
of
turf
and
into
the
hole
look
at
that
said
adèle
jonah
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
and
the
game
he
said
means
nothing
to
her
it
never
has
years
ago
she
and
i
got
into
the
final
at
hunstanton
she
put
me
dead
on
the
green
at
the
thirteenth
and
i
holed
out
when
i
turned
round
to
say
we
were
three
up
she
was
there
eventually
i
found
her
looking
for
her
iron
she
laid
it
down
to
start
on
a
daisy
chain
i
only
put
it
down
for
a
second
protested
jill
and
you
must
admit
the
daisies
were
simply
huge
what
happened
said
adèle
bubbling
the
daisy
chain
won
us
the
match
she
was
much
more
interested
in
the
former
and
actually
continued
its
fabrication
between
her
shots
we
passed
to
the
next
tee
as
i
was
addressing
the
ball
do
top
it
said
jill
have
i
been
topping
them
no
boy
only
do
be
careful
i
believe
there
a
lark
nest
down
there
and
it
be
a
shame
there
you
are
said
jonah
now
said
i
i
dead
certain
to
top
it
well
then
drive
more
to
the
right
said
jill
after
all
only
a
game
i
take
your
word
for
it
said
i
of
course
i
topped
the
ball
but
at
the
next
hole
my
cousin
discovered
that
our
caddie
had
a
puppy
in
his
pocket
so
we
won
easily
as
we
made
for
the
only
ten
days
to
christmas
said
adèle
can
you
believe
me
with
an
effort
said
i
it
almost
too
hot
to
be
true
indeed
it
might
have
been
a
june
morning
the
valley
was
sleepy
beneath
the
sun
the
slopes
of
the
sheltering
looked
warm
and
comfortable
naked
but
unashamed
the
woods
were
smiling
southward
a
long
flash
spoke
of
the
sunlit
peaks
and
the
dead
march
of
snow
and
there
a
league
away
grey
pau
was
basking
contentedly
her
decent
crinoline
of
villas
billowing
about
her
sides
lazily
looking
down
on
such
a
fuss
and
pother
as
might
have
bubbled
out
of
the
pot
of
revolution
but
was
in
fact
the
hospitable
rite
daily
observed
on
the
arrival
of
the
paris
train
i
simply
must
get
some
presents
continued
my
wife
we
start
i
groaned
you
ca
get
anything
here
i
protested
and
people
do
expect
presents
when
you
in
the
south
of
france
that
just
when
they
do
said
adèle
all
your
friends
consider
that
it
a
chance
in
a
lifetime
and
if
you
do
take
it
they
never
forgive
you
well
i
have
got
any
friends
said
i
so
that
that
and
you
used
to
tell
me
you
had
very
few
ah
said
adèle
that
was
before
we
were
engaged
that
was
to
excite
your
sympathy
i
appealed
to
my
cousins
for
support
nothing
doing
said
jonah
if
you
did
want
this
sort
of
thing
what
did
you
marry
for
for
longer
than
i
can
remember
you
seen
your
led
off
like
an
ox
to
the
shambles
he
there
now
financially
crippled
and
then
compelled
to
tie
up
and
address
innumerable
parcels
for
the
simple
reason
that
when
they
at
the
shops
daphne
faculty
of
allotment
invariably
refuses
to
function
jill
slid
an
arm
through
her
brother
patted
his
hand
affectionately
and
looked
at
adèle
if
boy
breaks
down
she
said
sweetly
i
lend
you
my
ox
simply
splendid
at
parcels
you
got
to
find
something
to
do
up
first
said
i
this
paris
a
colour
was
lent
to
my
foreboding
within
the
hour
as
we
sat
down
to
luncheon
yes
said
berry
my
vixen
and
i
have
spent
a
delightful
morning
we
been
through
fourteen
shops
and
bought
two
amethyst
necklets
and
a
pot
of
marmalade
i
subsequently
dropped
the
latter
in
the
place
royale
so
we
actually
twelve
down
whereabouts
in
the
place
royale
i
inquired
just
outside
the
club
everybody
i
knew
was
either
going
in
or
coming
out
so
it
went
very
well
indeed
there
was
a
gust
of
laughter
on
the
pavement
whimpered
jill
on
the
pavement
said
daphne
it
was
dreadful
i
never
was
so
ashamed
of
course
i
begged
him
to
pick
it
up
before
it
ran
out
think
he
do
it
not
he
said
it
was
written
and
it
was
no
good
fighting
against
fate
and
that
he
rather
wash
his
hands
of
it
than
after
it
and
that
sort
of
stuff
then
nobby
began
to
lick
it
up
but
for
fitch
i
think
we
should
have
been
arrested
mercifully
we
told
him
to
wait
for
us
by
the
bandstand
and
he
saw
the
whole
thing
it
all
very
fine
said
her
husband
it
was
i
who
furnished
and
suggested
the
use
of
the
current
issue
of
and
without
that
fitch
could
have
moved
as
it
was
one
sheet
made
a
shroud
another
a
pall
and
nobby
beard
and
paws
were
appropriately
wiped
upon
the
scandal
of
i
gather
said
jonah
that
the
dissolution
of
the
preserve
turned
an
indifferent
success
into
a
howling
failure
of
course
i
have
seen
the
necklets
but
i
ca
pretend
it
easy
said
daphne
it
is
that
there
any
shops
no
said
berry
emphatically
it
is
that
but
somehow
still
if
we
go
on
long
enough
we
shall
find
something
that
it
said
her
husband
we
going
to
put
our
backs
into
it
this
afternoon
after
we
done
another
twelve
shops
without
buying
anything
we
going
to
have
police
protection
not
that
we
need
it
you
know
but
it
improve
my
morale
if
only
sally
was
here
said
jill
she
could
have
told
us
where
to
go
if
only
her
sailor
would
turn
up
said
adèle
we
might
be
able
to
get
all
our
presents
from
him
that
an
idea
said
jonah
what
was
the
merchant
name
amid
a
buzz
of
excitement
daphne
sent
for
the
letter
which
had
announced
sarah
featherstone
departure
from
pau
when
it
arrived
she
read
the
material
portion
aloud
george
ca
get
away
so
peter
and
i
are
going
home
for
christmas
we
be
back
the
first
week
in
january
i
told
the
marats
that
if
planchet
the
sailor
who
sold
me
the
shawl
etc
turns
up
before
i
get
back
he
to
be
sent
on
to
you
if
he
got
anything
that
you
not
keen
on
you
might
get
it
for
me
well
i
never
thought
i
should
live
to
say
it
said
berry
but
after
what
i
gone
through
this
morning
if
planchet
were
to
totter
in
this
afternoon
laden
with
at
once
cheap
and
pretentious
goods
i
should
fall
upon
his
bull
neck
who
said
i
are
the
marats
they
the
married
couple
who
run
the
flat
i
believe
wonderful
sally
says
she
never
knew
what
service
was
before
i
do
hope
said
jill
twittering
they
do
make
any
mistake
i
no
fear
of
that
said
adèle
i
ca
answer
for
the
man
because
we
did
see
him
but
madame
marat
no
fool
incidentally
said
i
it
one
thing
giving
planchet
our
address
but
it
quite
another
persuading
him
to
fetch
up
he
may
have
other
sheep
to
shear
we
can
only
pray
that
he
has
said
daphne
it
too
much
to
expect
him
to
have
another
shawl
but
i
should
like
the
first
pick
of
what
he
has
berry
regarded
his
wife
if
he
said
you
will
swear
to
select
from
his
wares
all
the
blinkin
presents
with
which
you
propose
to
signalise
this
yuletide
i
i
tie
them
all
up
without
a
word
same
here
said
i
our
gifts
will
cost
us
more
but
we
shall
live
the
longer
ditto
said
jonah
the
girls
agreed
cheerfully
and
before
luncheon
was
over
it
had
been
decided
to
give
planchet
three
days
in
which
to
make
his
appearance
and
that
if
he
had
not
arrived
by
that
time
then
and
then
only
should
we
resort
to
the
shops
less
than
an
hour
had
elapsed
and
we
were
just
about
to
make
ready
to
take
the
air
by
the
simple
expedient
of
proceeding
at
a
high
speed
in
the
direction
of
biarritz
when
falcon
entered
the
room
there
an
individual
madam
come
to
the
door
planchet
is
it
planchet
i
afraid
i
can
say
madam
but
this
address
upon
a
piece
of
madam
and
all
right
falcon
i
come
the
butler
valiant
endeavours
to
cope
with
the
heritage
of
babel
were
better
known
to
us
than
he
imagined
more
than
once
his
efforts
to
extract
from
strangers
that
information
which
was
his
due
and
at
the
same
time
like
a
juggler
of
many
parts
to
keep
the
balls
of
dignity
and
courtesy
rolling
had
been
overheard
and
had
afforded
us
gratification
so
pronounced
as
to
necessitate
the
employment
of
cushions
and
other
improvised
gags
if
our
faithful
servant
feelings
were
to
come
to
no
harm
i
go
said
jill
and
adèle
simultaneously
we
all
went
and
we
were
all
just
in
time
to
see
our
visitor
precede
the
sealyham
in
the
direction
of
the
lodge
aghast
at
such
pleasantry
we
erupted
pellmell
into
the
drive
all
frantic
by
word
or
deed
to
distract
the
terrier
from
his
purpose
shrieks
curses
and
a
copy
of
fontaine
were
hurled
simultaneously
and
in
vain
at
our
favourite
and
it
was
berry
to
whom
the
fear
of
further
acquaintance
with
the
emporiums
of
pau
must
have
lent
wings
who
actually
overtook
and
discomfited
the
pursuer
some
three
yards
from
the
road
it
was
with
feelings
of
inexpressible
relief
that
we
presently
beheld
the
three
returning
berry
alternately
rebuking
the
sealyham
who
was
under
his
arm
and
apologising
to
his
guest
the
latter
something
out
of
breath
and
anything
but
easy
and
nobby
apparently
torn
between
an
aggressively
affectionate
regard
for
his
captor
and
a
still
furiously
expressed
suspicion
of
the
stranger
within
our
gates
as
the
trio
drew
nigh
it
is
monsieur
planchet
called
berry
he
brought
some
things
for
us
to
see
his
man
behind
with
a
barrow
with
beating
hearts
we
trooped
back
into
the
house
as
i
returned
from
thrusting
nobby
into
a
bedroom
monsieur
hireling
staggered
into
the
hall
a
gigantic
poised
precariously
upon
his
hunched
shoulders
the
inspection
was
held
in
the
it
was
rather
late
in
the
day
to
assume
that
nonchalant
air
which
has
from
time
immemorial
adorned
the
armouries
of
all
accomplished
hucksters
our
instant
recognition
of
the
salesman
our
energetic
solicitude
for
his
safety
and
our
obvious
anxiety
to
dissociate
ourselves
from
the
policy
of
direct
action
adopted
by
the
terrier
had
not
only
betrayed
but
emphasised
the
fact
that
the
sailor
arrival
was
very
much
to
our
taste
clearly
if
we
did
not
wish
to
pay
through
the
nose
for
what
we
purchased
our
only
course
was
to
feign
disappointment
when
the
wares
were
produced
for
what
it
was
worth
i
circulated
a
covert
recommendation
of
this
wile
which
was
acknowledged
with
sundry
nods
and
inaudible
assurances
the
latter
so
far
as
jill
was
concerned
too
readily
given
to
inspire
me
with
confidence
sure
enough
when
the
lid
of
the
trunk
was
lifted
and
planchet
plucked
forth
a
truly
exquisite
rug
and
flung
it
dexterously
across
a
chair
my
cousin
let
out
a
gasp
which
an
infant
in
arms
could
not
have
misinterpreted
there
was
only
one
thing
to
be
done
and
daphne
did
it
with
a
heroic
disregard
for
her
reputation
she
shook
her
head
too
bright
she
said
shortly
do
you
think
so
she
added
turning
to
berry
the
latter
swallowed
before
replying
it
positively
gaudy
he
said
gloomily
planchet
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
began
to
unfasten
a
bale
by
the
time
seven
more
persian
rugs
all
old
and
all
more
than
ordinarily
pleasing
in
design
and
colouring
were
sprawling
about
the
chamber
any
organised
depreciation
was
out
of
the
question
where
all
were
so
beautiful
it
required
a
larger
output
of
moral
courage
than
any
one
of
us
could
essay
to
decry
the
whole
pack
by
way
of
doing
his
or
her
bit
everybody
decided
to
praise
one
or
two
to
the
implied
condemnation
of
the
remainder
in
the
absence
of
collusion
it
was
inevitable
that
those
rugs
which
somebody
had
thus
branded
as
goats
should
invariably
include
somebody
else
sheep
the
result
was
that
every
single
rug
had
its
following
a
glance
at
their
owner
who
was
standing
aside
making
no
offer
to
commend
his
carpets
but
fingering
his
chin
and
watching
us
narrowly
with
eyes
showed
that
he
was
solely
engaged
in
considering
how
much
he
dared
ask
i
moved
across
to
him
you
only
come
here
twice
a
year
i
inquired
that
is
so
and
how
do
you
get
these
things
by
barter
yes
after
a
little
encouragement
he
explained
that
before
each
voyage
he
laid
in
a
stock
of
knives
gramophones
mirrors
trinkets
and
the
like
these
to
exchange
with
the
natives
in
the
bazaars
of
the
smaller
eastern
ports
at
which
his
ship
touched
from
bordeaux
he
used
to
set
out
and
to
bordeaux
he
as
regularly
returned
an
aunt
dwelling
at
pau
was
responsible
for
his
selection
of
the
town
as
a
market
for
his
goods
i
should
not
have
taken
him
for
a
sailor
and
said
as
much
with
a
shy
smile
he
confessed
that
he
was
a
steward
adding
that
he
was
a
landsman
at
heart
and
that
but
for
the
opportunities
of
trading
which
his
occupation
presented
he
should
go
to
sea
no
more
suddenly
what
else
have
you
got
said
daphne
six
panels
of
chinese
embroidery
all
and
gold
orient
ivories
a
gorgeous
hanging
that
had
been
the
coat
of
a
proud
mandarin
three
chinese
mats
aged
and
flawless
a
set
of
silken
doilies
each
one
displaying
a
miniature
landscape
limned
with
a
subtlety
that
baffled
every
eye
one
by
one
these
treasures
were
laid
before
us
even
jonah
went
down
before
the
ivories
ere
the
trunk
was
empty
we
had
one
and
all
dropped
our
masks
and
were
revelling
openly
now
is
that
beautiful
sally
got
a
ball
like
that
but
it
is
so
big
it
just
as
well
she
in
ireland
or
we
have
had
those
mats
you
know
that
rug
on
the
chair
a
devilish
fine
one
they
all
are
yes
but
that
my
dear
fellow
it
the
sort
of
rug
they
put
in
the
window
and
refuse
to
sell
because
such
an
advertisement
i
tell
you
what
if
we
had
those
panels
made
into
curtains
they
look
simply
priceless
in
the
give
me
the
ivories
it
was
adèle
who
pulled
the
what
the
price
of
this
rug
she
said
quietly
there
was
an
expectant
and
guilty
hush
with
a
careless
flourish
we
had
called
the
tune
clamoured
for
it
if
the
piper
fee
was
exorbitant
we
had
only
ourselves
to
thank
planchet
hesitated
then
five
hundred
francs
ten
pounds
you
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
the
rug
was
worth
sixty
in
regent
street
or
fifth
avenue
we
should
have
been
asked
a
hundred
if
this
was
typical
of
planchet
prices
no
wonder
sally
had
plunged
i
took
out
a
pencil
and
picked
up
a
pad
of
notepaper
and
the
other
rugs
i
inquired
the
same
price
the
rugs
went
down
slowly
and
without
a
shadow
of
argument
the
prices
of
the
other
valuables
were
asked
received
and
entered
with
a
shaking
hand
i
counted
up
the
figures
eight
thousand
six
hundred
francs
i
passed
the
paper
to
berry
will
you
pay
him
i
said
i
have
got
enough
at
the
bank
here
and
you
ca
expect
him
to
take
a
foreign
cheque
right
oh
he
may
not
want
to
part
with
them
all
at
one
house
said
daphne
you
better
ask
him
adèle
smiled
very
charmingly
we
like
your
pretty
things
very
much
she
said
may
we
have
what
you
shown
us
planchet
inclined
his
head
as
pleases
i
crossed
to
where
he
was
standing
and
went
through
my
list
identifying
each
article
as
i
came
to
it
and
making
him
confirm
the
price
when
we
had
finished
i
insisted
upon
him
checking
my
figures
he
did
so
with
some
show
of
reluctance
the
total
seemingly
was
good
enough
when
the
reckoning
was
over
i
hesitated
then
you
know
i
said
slowly
we
have
to
pay
much
more
than
this
in
the
shops
it
seemed
only
fair
planchet
spread
out
his
hands
is
very
kind
but
for
me
i
should
not
obtain
more
from
the
merchants
i
know
them
they
are
robbers
i
prefer
infinitely
to
deal
with
you
all
right
you
do
mind
a
cheque
a
cheque
yes
on
the
bank
here
we
have
so
much
money
in
the
house
the
little
man
hesitated
nervously
the
big
brown
eyes
turned
from
me
to
fall
upon
his
possessions
that
all
right
said
berry
the
bank
still
open
fitch
can
run
up
in
the
car
and
get
the
money
he
probably
had
a
dud
cheque
some
time
or
other
anyway
considering
he
knows
nothing
of
us
and
out
of
reach
i
do
blame
him
such
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
was
unanimously
approved
and
when
i
communicated
our
intention
to
planchet
the
latter
seemed
greatly
relieved
it
was
not
he
explained
volubly
that
he
did
not
trust
us
but
when
a
poor
sailor
produced
such
a
cheque
to
a
bank
as
berry
left
to
give
the
chauffeur
his
instructions
last
time
you
came
said
daphne
you
brought
a
beautiful
shawl
featherstone
bought
it
planchet
frowned
thoughtfully
then
his
face
lighted
with
recollection
perfectly
i
remember
it
it
was
very
fine
i
have
another
like
it
at
home
my
sister
caught
her
breath
for
sale
if
adèle
and
jill
clasped
one
another
i
will
bring
it
with
an
obvious
effort
daphne
controlled
her
excitement
i
we
should
like
to
have
a
look
at
it
she
said
planchet
inclined
his
head
morning
without
more
ado
he
packed
up
his
traps
announced
that
as
he
was
returning
on
the
morrow
there
was
now
no
occasion
for
him
to
wait
for
his
money
and
thanking
us
profusely
for
our
patronage
and
assuring
us
that
he
was
ever
at
our
service
summoned
his
employee
and
withdrew
humbly
enough
it
was
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
first
wave
of
our
enthusiasm
had
spent
itself
after
a
positive
debauch
of
amicable
bickering
with
regard
to
the
precise
order
of
precedence
in
which
an
antiquary
would
place
our
acquisitions
and
breathless
speculation
concerning
their
true
worth
we
sank
into
sitting
postures
about
the
room
and
smiled
affectionately
upon
one
another
and
now
said
berry
what
about
tying
them
up
what
for
said
jill
well
you
ca
send
them
through
the
post
as
they
are
you
do
imagine
said
daphne
in
the
horrified
tone
of
one
who
repeats
a
blasphemy
you
do
imagine
that
we
going
to
give
these
things
away
berry
looked
round
wildly
mean
to
say
you
going
to
keep
them
he
cried
of
course
we
are
said
his
wife
what
all
of
them
my
sister
nodded
every
single
one
she
said
with
an
unearthly
shriek
berry
lay
back
in
his
chair
and
drummed
with
his
heels
upon
the
floor
i
ca
bear
it
he
roared
i
ca
bear
it
i
wo
insufferable
i
parted
with
the
savings
of
a
lifetime
for
a
whole
roomful
of
luxuries
not
one
of
which
in
the
ordinary
way
we
should
have
dreamed
of
purchasing
not
one
of
which
we
require
to
not
one
of
which
had
you
seen
it
in
a
shop
you
would
have
given
a
second
thought
all
of
which
are
probably
spurious
shame
cried
only
to
be
told
that
i
still
got
to
prosecute
the
mutually
revolting
acquaintance
with
infuriated
shopkeepers
forced
upon
me
this
morning
it
cruelty
to
animals
and
i
shall
write
to
the
besides
it
more
blessed
i
ca
help
it
said
daphne
the
man
had
absolutely
nothing
that
would
have
done
for
anybody
if
one
second
said
her
husband
i
have
parsed
that
sentence
yet
and
what
mean
by
for
because
if
daphne
continued
doggedly
we
sent
one
of
those
rugs
to
someone
for
christmas
they
think
we
gone
mad
berry
sighed
i
not
sure
we
have
he
said
any
way
he
nodded
at
jonah
and
myself
i
trouble
each
of
you
gents
for
a
cheque
for
sixty
pounds
as
it
is
i
shall
have
to
give
up
paying
my
tailor
again
and
what
with
lent
coming
on
wearily
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
now
i
going
to
have
a
good
healthy
cry
globules
the
size
of
pigeons
eggs
will
well
from
my
orbs
i
know
said
jill
these
things
can
be
our
christmas
presents
to
one
another
berry
laughed
hysterically
what
a
charming
idea
he
said
brokenly
and
how
generous
i
shall
always
treasure
it
every
time
i
look
at
my
overcome
with
emotion
he
stepped
out
of
the
room
a
muffled
bark
reminded
me
that
nobby
was
still
imprisoned
and
i
rose
to
follow
my
as
i
was
closing
the
door
i
heard
my
wife
voice
you
know
i
simply
pining
to
see
that
shawl
at
ten
the
next
morning
the
most
beautiful
piece
of
embroidery
i
have
ever
seen
passed
into
our
possession
in
return
for
the
ridiculously
inadequate
sum
of
two
thousand
francs
obviously
very
old
the
pale
yellow
silk
of
which
the
shawl
was
made
was
literally
strewn
with
blossoms
each
tender
one
of
them
a
work
of
art
all
the
matchless
cunning
all
the
unspeakable
patience
all
the
inscrutable
spirit
of
china
blinked
and
smiled
at
you
out
of
those
wonderful
flowers
there
never
was
such
a
show
daring
walked
delicately
daintiness
was
become
bold
those
that
wrought
the
marvel
for
so
magnificent
an
artifice
was
never
the
work
of
one
man
were
painters
born
painters
whose
paints
were
threads
of
silk
whose
brushes
needles
year
after
year
they
had
toiled
upon
these
square
feet
of
faded
silk
and
always
perfectly
the
thing
was
a
miracle
the
blazing
achievement
of
a
reachless
ideal
upon
both
lovely
sides
the
work
was
identical
the
knotted
fringe
itself
bewildering
evidence
of
faultless
labour
was
three
feet
deep
and
while
the
whole
shawl
could
have
been
passed
through
a
bracelet
it
scaled
the
remarkable
weight
of
nearly
six
pounds
daphne
adèle
and
jill
with
one
voice
declared
that
it
was
finer
than
sally
as
for
berry
jonah
and
myself
we
humbly
withdrew
such
adverse
criticism
as
we
had
levelled
at
the
latter
and
derived
an
almost
childish
glee
from
the
possession
of
its
fellow
it
was
indeed
our
joy
over
this
latest
requisition
that
stiffened
into
resolution
an
uneasy
feeling
that
we
ought
to
give
sally
a
slice
of
our
luck
after
considerable
discussion
we
decided
to
make
her
a
present
of
the
three
chinese
mats
she
had
bought
three
of
planchet
upon
his
last
visit
and
those
we
had
just
purchased
would
bring
her
set
up
to
six
lest
we
should
repent
our
impulse
we
did
them
up
there
and
then
and
sent
them
off
by
fitch
the
same
afternoon
christmas
was
over
and
gone
in
the
three
days
immediately
preceding
the
festival
such
popularity
with
the
tradesmen
of
the
town
as
we
had
forfeited
was
more
than
redeemed
at
the
expense
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
of
an
overdraft
at
the
bank
absurdly
handsome
presents
were
purchased
right
and
left
adèle
acquaintance
was
extremely
wide
observing
that
it
was
also
in
every
instance
domiciled
in
the
united
states
with
the
density
of
a
male
i
ventured
to
point
out
that
upon
the
day
which
my
wife
presents
were
intended
to
enrich
all
of
them
would
indubitably
be
lying
in
the
custody
of
the
french
postal
authorities
thereupon
it
was
gently
explained
to
me
that
so
long
as
a
parcel
had
been
obviously
posted
before
christmas
its
contents
were
always
considered
to
have
arrived
in
time
a
conceit
which
i
had
hitherto
imagined
to
be
the
property
of
bookmakers
alone
in
short
from
first
to
last
my
wife
was
inexorable
but
for
the
spectacle
of
berry
and
jonah
being
relentlessly
driven
along
the
same
track
life
would
have
lost
its
savour
indeed
as
far
as
we
three
were
concerned
most
of
the
working
hours
of
christmas
eve
were
spent
at
the
post
office
the
registration
of
a
postal
packet
in
france
is
no
laughing
matter
when
a
coloured
form
has
to
be
obtained
completed
and
deliberately
scrutinised
before
a
parcel
can
be
accepted
when
there
is
only
one
pen
where
there
are
people
in
front
of
you
each
with
two
or
more
packages
to
be
registered
when
there
is
only
one
registration
clerk
when
mental
arithmetic
is
not
that
clerk
when
it
is
the
local
custom
invariably
to
question
the
accuracy
first
of
the
postage
demanded
and
then
of
the
change
received
when
the
atmosphere
of
the
post
office
is
germane
to
and
when
you
are
bearing
twelve
parcels
and
leading
a
sealyham
the
act
of
registration
and
its
preliminaries
are
conducive
to
the
miniature
of
herself
however
with
which
my
wife
presented
me
on
christmas
day
atoned
for
everything
and
now
christmas
was
over
and
gone
the
new
year
too
had
come
in
with
a
truly
french
explosion
of
merriment
and
it
was
in
fact
the
fourth
day
of
january
and
with
the
exception
of
my
cousins
who
were
upon
the
links
we
were
proceeding
gingerly
down
the
rue
du
lycée
en
route
for
lourdes
when
my
sister
gave
a
cry
and
called
upon
me
to
stop
as
i
did
so
i
saw
featherstone
stepping
towards
us
across
the
open
space
which
fronts
the
market
berry
climbed
out
of
the
dickey
and
adèle
and
daphne
got
out
of
the
car
as
i
followed
them
sally
my
dear
said
daphne
i
never
knew
you
were
back
i
was
till
this
morning
panted
sally
i
only
arrived
at
eight
for
the
last
three
hours
i
been
before
you
tell
us
anything
said
daphne
we
want
to
thank
you
since
you
been
away
planchet
been
he
sold
us
the
most
lovely
things
i
ever
seen
we
so
grateful
to
you
we
do
know
what
to
do
well
for
goodness
sake
rejoined
sally
insure
them
just
been
cleaned
out
of
everything
i
got
cleaned
out
cried
daphne
mean
to
say
you
been
robbed
that
right
said
sally
peter
and
i
got
back
this
morning
to
find
the
marats
gone
and
the
place
stripped
of
course
the
furniture
belonging
to
the
flat
there
but
the
only
decent
things
were
what
added
and
those
have
vanished
not
all
the
things
you
got
from
planchet
rather
said
sally
shawl
and
everything
jolly
is
it
what
an
awful
shame
cried
adèle
but
who
taken
them
not
the
marats
must
be
said
featherstone
she
nodded
over
her
shoulder
i
just
been
to
the
police
about
it
but
you
know
how
hopeless
they
are
if
i
can
do
anything
said
berry
you
know
i
only
be
too
happy
thanks
awfully
was
the
reply
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
see
what
there
is
to
be
done
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
they
left
before
christmas
so
they
got
a
pretty
good
start
i
terribly
sorry
said
i
of
course
i
never
saw
the
goods
but
if
they
were
anything
like
the
things
we
bought
it
a
cruel
shame
featherstone
laughed
i
do
feel
sore
she
admitted
the
maddening
part
of
it
is
i
meant
to
take
the
shawl
home
to
show
george
and
then
in
the
rush
at
the
last
i
left
it
out
she
turned
to
my
sister
and
you
know
i
trusted
that
couple
implicitly
i
know
you
did
the
queer
thing
is
they
seem
to
have
suffered
one
solitary
pang
of
remorse
did
i
show
you
those
chinese
mats
i
was
so
crazy
about
well
after
they
gone
i
suppose
their
hearts
smote
them
because
they
did
the
three
up
and
sent
them
back
for
a
moment
we
looked
at
one
another
then
i
sorry
to
disappoint
you
sally
said
daphne
gently
but
you
must
give
the
brutes
that
credit
we
sent
you
the
mats
as
a
christmas
present
sally
knitted
her
brows
they
not
yours
we
bought
them
from
planchet
directly
i
saw
them
i
thought
how
beautifully
they
match
yours
and
we
wanted
you
to
have
a
set
sally
stared
at
her
but
i
could
have
sworn
i
know
said
daphne
it
was
because
they
were
such
a
wonderful
match
that
we
what
else
did
he
sell
you
a
sudden
thought
came
to
me
and
i
turned
to
catch
berry
by
the
arm
as
men
in
a
film
he
and
i
looked
at
one
another
with
open
mouths
sublimely
unconscious
daphne
and
adèle
were
reciting
the
list
of
our
treasures
featherstone
heard
them
out
solemnly
then
and
what
she
said
does
planchet
look
like
it
became
daphne
turn
to
stare
i
moistened
my
lips
slight
dark
large
brown
eyes
nervous
manner
scar
on
the
left
temple
am
i
describing
marat
sally
spread
out
her
hands
to
the
life
she
said
simply
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
at
length
i
said
slowly
order
of
the
trustees
owner
going
abroad
marat
was
with
you
when
you
bought
them
of
course
but
what
a
smart
bit
of
work
sally
covered
her
face
and
began
to
shake
with
laughter
daphne
and
adèle
stared
at
her
as
if
bewitched
at
his
third
attempt
to
speak
well
that
topping
said
berry
and
now
will
you
come
back
and
get
your
things
now
or
shall
we
bring
them
over
taken
every
care
of
them
he
sighed
when
i
think
he
added
that
but
for
my
good
offices
nobby
would
have
sent
that
treacherous
drawlatch
away
not
only
empty
but
with
the
modern
equivalent
of
a
flea
in
his
ear
i
could
writhe
when
i
reflect
that
it
was
i
who
supported
the
swine
predilection
for
hard
cash
i
could
scream
but
when
i
remember
that
ever
since
our
purchase
of
the
shawl
my
wife
has
never
once
stopped
enumerating
indicating
the
many
superiorities
which
distinguish
it
from
yours
i
want
to
break
something
he
looked
round
savagely
where
a
grocer
he
demanded
i
want
some
marmalade
chapter
iv
how
berry
made
an
engagement
jill
a
picture
and
adèle
a
slip
of
some
importance
a
natural
result
of
our
traffic
with
planchet
was
that
we
became
temporarily
suspicious
and
careful
to
a
fault
the
horse
had
been
stolen
for
the
next
three
weeks
we
locked
not
only
the
stable
door
but
every
single
door
to
which
a
key
could
be
fitted
and
suffered
accordingly
in
a
word
our
convenience
writhed
to
complete
our
discomfort
if
ever
one
of
us
jibbed
the
others
were
sure
to
lay
the
lash
about
his
shoulders
the
beginning
of
the
end
arrived
one
fine
february
day
an
early
breakfast
had
made
us
ready
for
lunch
as
we
were
taking
our
seats
are
the
cars
locked
said
daphne
adèle
held
up
a
key
pong
is
she
said
my
sister
fumed
to
jonah
and
ping
my
cousin
shook
his
head
no
he
said
shortly
i
omitted
the
precaution
if
this
was
paris
instead
of
pau
if
the
cars
were
standing
in
an
undesirable
thoroughfare
instead
of
in
the
courtyard
of
the
english
club
if
it
all
very
well
said
daphne
but
you
know
what
happened
to
the
rolls
berry
frowned
any
reference
he
said
to
that
distressing
incident
is
bad
for
my
heart
he
turned
to
jonah
as
for
you
you
lodged
your
protest
which
will
receive
the
deepest
consideration
i
shall
dwell
upon
it
during
the
soup
and
now
push
off
and
lock
the
vehicle
i
know
love
laughs
at
locksmiths
but
the
average
sense
of
humour
is
less
susceptible
when
his
sister
threw
her
entreaties
into
the
scale
my
cousin
took
the
line
of
least
resistance
and
rose
to
his
feet
for
converting
a
qualified
blessing
into
an
unqualified
curse
he
said
bitterly
you
three
alarmists
take
the
complete
cracknel
since
the
locks
were
fitted
i
done
nothing
but
turn
the
key
from
morning
till
night
before
the
beastly
things
were
thought
of
the
idea
of
larceny
never
entered
your
heads
the
indignation
with
which
his
words
were
received
would
have
been
more
pronounced
if
we
had
had
the
room
to
ourselves
as
it
was
jonah
made
his
way
to
the
door
amid
an
enraged
murmur
of
expostulation
whose
temper
was
aggravated
by
suppression
almost
to
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
both
points
of
view
it
was
a
fact
that
since
the
theft
of
the
rolls
we
had
never
felt
easy
about
leaving
a
car
unattended
yet
though
we
had
often
discussed
the
matter
nothing
had
been
done
now
however
that
we
were
in
a
strange
country
where
the
tracing
of
a
stolen
car
would
for
a
variety
of
reasons
be
an
extremely
difficult
undertaking
and
staying
withal
only
a
handful
of
miles
from
the
spanish
frontier
we
all
felt
that
action
of
some
sort
must
be
taken
without
delay
an
attempt
to
enlist
the
services
of
the
sealyham
as
a
custodian
had
failed
ignominiously
in
the
first
place
unless
fastened
he
had
flatly
declined
to
stay
with
either
of
the
cars
the
expedient
of
closing
one
of
these
altogether
and
leaving
nobby
within
had
proved
quite
as
unsatisfactory
and
more
humiliating
had
we
been
able
to
eradicate
from
the
dog
mind
the
conviction
that
he
was
being
wrongfully
imprisoned
the
result
might
have
been
different
as
it
was
after
barking
furiously
for
five
minutes
he
had
recourse
to
reprisal
and
hardly
waiting
to
remove
the
paper
in
which
it
was
wrapped
devoured
half
a
kilogramme
of
ripe
brie
with
a
revengeful
voracity
to
which
the
condition
of
the
interior
of
the
car
bore
hideous
witness
finally
when
the
urchin
who
was
in
our
confidence
and
had
engaged
for
the
sum
of
five
francs
to
endeavour
to
enter
the
car
opened
its
door
the
captive
leaped
out
joyously
and
after
capering
with
delight
at
his
delivery
wiped
his
mouth
enthusiastically
upon
a
tire
and
started
on
a
reconnaissance
of
the
neighbourhood
in
the
hope
of
encountering
his
gaolers
as
for
the
car
our
employee
might
have
driven
it
into
the
blue
in
the
end
it
was
decided
that
a
lock
attached
to
the
would
offer
the
best
security
accordingly
a
device
was
sent
for
fitted
to
each
of
the
cars
and
proved
so
far
as
we
could
see
there
was
no
fault
in
it
once
the
key
was
withdrawn
the
car
concerned
was
useless
it
could
be
driven
certainly
but
it
could
not
be
steered
indeed
short
of
getting
it
upon
a
trolley
or
taking
down
its
asportation
could
not
be
compassed
new
brooms
sweep
clean
delighted
with
the
realisation
that
theft
could
now
be
erased
from
the
list
of
terrors
of
motoring
the
girls
insisted
upon
the
observance
of
the
new
rite
upon
every
possible
occasion
as
drivers
of
long
standing
jonah
and
i
found
this
eagerness
hard
to
indulge
use
holds
and
try
as
we
would
it
was
absurdly
difficult
to
remember
to
do
as
we
had
never
done
before
whenever
we
evacuated
a
car
often
enough
as
now
it
was
a
work
of
supererogation
berry
turned
to
me
i
observe
he
said
that
for
once
you
have
not
advanced
your
opinion
is
this
because
you
realise
that
it
valueless
or
your
mouth
work
jonah
was
right
said
i
insurance
has
its
advantages
but
you
do
register
every
letter
you
post
the
truth
is
what
little
sense
of
proportion
you
have
is
failing
of
course
you
not
as
young
as
you
were
and
then
again
you
eat
too
much
in
other
words
said
my
you
attribute
caution
to
the
advance
of
old
age
and
gluttony
i
see
to
which
of
your
physical
infirmities
do
you
ascribe
a
superabundance
of
treachery
and
bile
that
said
i
is
due
to
external
influence
the
of
your
temperament
i
refuse
said
berry
to
sit
still
and
hear
my
soul
compared
to
a
drain
at
the
very
outset
of
what
promises
to
be
a
toothsome
repast
it
might
affect
my
appetite
i
raised
my
eyebrows
needless
anxiety
again
i
sighed
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
you
by
the
way
said
daphne
i
quite
forgot
did
you
cash
your
cheque
i
did
said
her
husband
what
did
they
give
you
said
jill
francs
to
the
pound
cried
daphne
and
adèle
in
tones
francs
dead
if
i
cashed
it
yesterday
as
but
for
your
entreaties
i
should
have
done
i
should
have
got
but
when
you
found
it
was
down
why
did
you
wait
in
the
first
place
retorted
my
it
is
down
up
in
the
second
place
i
was
down
to
four
francs
in
the
third
place
it
may
be
up
to
fifty
it
much
more
likely
to
go
back
to
my
dear
girl
said
berry
with
the
question
of
likelihood
the
movements
of
the
comic
exchange
have
nothing
to
do
it
a
law
unto
itself
compared
with
the
money
market
of
monte
carlo
a
i
admit
we
have
more
of
a
show
if
we
did
get
the
paper
a
day
late
still
that
makes
it
more
sporting
i
do
see
any
sport
in
losing
six
hundred
francs
said
his
wife
it
throwing
away
money
here
my
cousin
reappeared
jonah
why
did
you
let
him
do
it
do
what
said
jonah
cash
such
a
cheque
when
the
franc
dropped
it
has
said
jonah
it
risen
how
piped
jill
can
it
have
risen
when
it
gone
down
it
has
gone
down
said
i
but
less
than
let
me
explain
said
berry
taking
an
olive
from
a
dish
you
see
that
yes
said
jill
staring
well
that
represents
a
dollar
the
olive
is
a
franc
and
this
here
roll
is
a
pound
he
cleared
his
throat
when
the
imports
exceed
the
exports
the
roll
rises
up
went
his
hand
as
good
bread
should
but
when
the
exports
exceed
the
imports
or
the
president
backs
a
winner
or
something
then
the
olive
begins
to
soar
in
a
word
the
higher
the
fewer
jill
passed
a
hand
across
her
sweet
pretty
brow
but
what
the
got
to
do
with
it
nothing
whatever
said
berry
that
was
to
distract
your
attention
jill
choked
with
indignation
i
never
ask
you
anything
again
she
said
severely
after
all
if
you
ca
help
yourself
it
is
likely
you
can
help
me
and
any
way
i
would
have
been
so
silly
as
to
go
and
cash
a
cheque
when
the
franc
had
gone
down
up
said
i
relentlessly
but
how
can
it
look
here
said
i
imagine
that
all
the
francs
in
the
world
have
turned
into
herrings
what
a
joy
shopping
would
be
said
berry
yes
said
jill
faithfully
well
on
monday
you
go
and
buy
a
pound
worth
of
herrings
fish
is
plentiful
so
you
get
yes
during
the
night
herrings
rise
get
quite
high
said
berry
you
have
to
get
out
of
bed
and
put
your
purse
on
the
landing
adèle
began
to
shake
with
laughter
yes
said
jill
earnestly
so
that
the
next
morning
i
continued
desperately
when
you
come
to
buy
another
pound
worth
of
herrings
you
only
get
that
right
said
berry
and
while
you
trying
to
decide
whether
to
have
one
or
two
pounds
they
turn
into
bananas
then
you
done
jonah
took
up
the
cudgels
it
perfectly
simple
he
said
think
of
a
thermometer
jill
took
a
deep
breath
then
yes
she
said
well
on
monday
you
find
it
on
tuesday
you
look
at
it
again
and
find
it
that
means
it
gone
down
it
yes
said
his
sister
hopefully
well
with
the
franc
it
just
the
opposite
it
means
it
gone
up
yes
that
all
said
jonah
brutally
jill
looked
from
him
to
daphne
and
from
daphne
to
adèle
dazedly
the
former
put
a
hand
to
her
head
my
dear
she
said
i
ca
help
you
before
they
started
explaining
i
had
a
rough
idea
of
how
the
thing
worked
now
confused
for
ever
if
they
are
to
be
believed
in
future
we
got
to
say
when
we
feel
inclined
to
say
but
do
ask
me
why
she
stopped
to
speak
with
a
member
who
was
leaving
the
room
and
had
come
to
pay
his
respects
after
a
word
or
two
visitors
weather
he
said
perfect
is
it
but
i
say
what
a
fall
in
the
franc
three
points
in
a
day
never
mind
it
go
up
again
he
made
his
adieus
and
passed
on
it
was
no
good
saying
anything
a
prophet
is
not
without
honour
save
in
his
own
country
it
was
three
days
later
that
we
were
bowling
along
the
road
to
biarritz
the
morning
was
full
and
good
to
look
upon
sun
sky
and
air
offered
the
best
they
had
to
match
their
gifts
a
green
and
silver
earth
strained
at
the
leash
of
winter
with
an
eager
heart
the
valleys
smiled
high
places
lifted
up
their
heads
the
hasty
gave
de
pau
swirled
on
its
shining
way
a
laughing
sash
of
and
all
the
countryside
glowed
with
the
cheerful
aspect
of
a
slave
wide
straight
and
level
the
road
thrust
through
the
beaming
landscape
with
a
directness
that
took
distance
by
the
throat
the
surface
improving
as
we
left
pau
behind
i
drew
on
the
boots
surreptitiously
very
soon
we
were
flying
with
a
steady
purr
of
contentment
pong
tuned
to
a
hair
swallowed
the
flashing
miles
so
easily
that
pace
was
robbed
of
its
sting
a
dot
on
the
soft
that
edged
the
road
grew
with
fantastic
swiftness
into
an
loomed
for
an
instant
and
was
gone
a
speck
ahead
leapt
into
the
shape
of
a
gig
jogged
for
a
moment
to
meet
us
and
vanished
into
space
a
by
the
wayside
swelled
into
a
villa
a
château
a
memory
of
tall
thin
windows
ranged
in
a
white
wall
the
future
swooped
into
the
present
only
to
be
flicked
into
the
past
the
boots
were
getting
into
their
stride
then
came
a
with
the
barriers
drawn
for
a
minute
the
lady
responsible
for
the
obstructions
seemed
uncertain
whether
to
withdraw
them
or
no
after
a
long
look
up
the
line
however
she
decided
against
us
and
shook
her
head
with
a
benevolent
smile
train
she
explained
with
a
sigh
i
stopped
the
engine
and
lighted
a
cigarette
what
exactly
said
daphne
did
evelyn
say
that
said
berry
as
i
have
already
endeavoured
to
point
out
will
always
remain
a
matter
for
conjecture
we
addressed
one
another
for
more
than
twenty
minutes
but
our
possession
of
the
line
was
disputed
effectively
during
the
whole
of
that
period
well
what
did
you
hear
her
say
i
heard
her
say
twice
and
and
almost
certain
that
towards
the
end
of
our
communion
she
said
hell
having
regard
to
the
prevailing
conditions
she
may
be
forgiven
daphne
sighed
well
i
suppose
she
expects
us
she
said
after
all
that
the
main
thing
you
made
her
understand
it
was
did
you
that
was
the
reply
remains
to
be
seen
if
i
did
it
not
my
fault
it
no
good
pretending
that
a
good
word
to
shout
but
i
made
the
most
of
it
i
also
said
day
with
great
clarity
and
shrieked
his
wife
oh
much
louder
than
that
that
berry
started
guiltily
i
i
mean
he
said
hurriedly
i
began
to
shake
with
merriment
suspiciously
my
sister
regarded
her
husband
which
did
you
say
she
demanded
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
cried
daphne
you
said
you
know
you
did
here
a
seemingly
interminable
started
to
lumber
across
our
path
as
the
rumble
began
to
die
i
think
said
i
he
must
have
got
through
otherwise
evelyn
would
have
rung
up
last
night
berry
drew
a
case
from
his
pocket
and
offered
me
a
cigar
then
he
turned
to
my
sister
and
protruded
his
tongue
we
had
known
evelyn
fairie
for
years
it
was
natural
that
we
should
wish
to
know
evelyn
swetecote
that
wedlock
could
have
diminished
her
charm
was
not
to
be
thought
of
but
we
were
forgivably
curious
to
see
her
in
the
married
state
and
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
man
whom
she
had
chosen
out
of
so
many
suitors
little
knowing
that
we
were
at
pau
evelyn
had
written
to
us
from
biarritz
in
due
season
her
letter
had
arrived
coming
by
way
of
hampshire
an
answer
in
the
shape
of
a
general
invitation
to
lunch
had
brought
not
so
much
a
refusal
as
a
definite
that
we
should
suggest
a
day
and
come
to
biarritz
in
reply
the
services
of
the
telephone
had
been
requisitioned
and
if
my
was
to
be
believed
swetecote
had
been
advised
to
expect
us
on
wednesday
in
any
event
expected
or
unexpected
here
were
we
all
six
upon
the
road
my
wife
and
cousins
in
one
car
and
daphne
berry
and
i
within
the
other
as
we
swung
into
the
paved
streets
of
orthez
and
when
said
berry
when
am
i
to
drive
from
peyrehorade
i
replied
oh
i
suppose
that
where
the
stones
begin
or
the
road
stops
or
something
i
shook
my
head
not
that
i
know
of
and
you
can
drive
all
the
way
back
but
well
there
a
hill
or
two
coming
and
and
i
like
just
to
take
her
so
far
i
concluded
lamely
but
for
my
sister
presence
i
would
have
told
him
the
truth
this
was
that
i
had
bet
jonah
that
i
could
get
from
orthez
to
peyrehorade
in
twenty
minutes
the
distance
was
exactly
thirty
kilometres
and
the
road
was
perfect
there
were
no
corners
and
the
bends
were
few
there
were
hills
certainly
but
these
were
straightforward
enough
and
could
be
taken
so
to
speak
in
our
stride
moreover
there
were
no
and
only
two
turnings
worth
thinking
about
to
some
cars
the
feat
would
have
been
nothing
whether
it
was
within
the
reach
of
ping
and
pong
remained
to
be
seen
as
we
left
orthez
i
looked
at
my
watch
ten
minutes
to
eleven
i
laid
hold
of
the
wheel
to
this
hour
i
can
not
tell
why
daphne
did
not
exercise
the
prerogative
of
a
passenger
and
protest
against
the
pace
but
neither
at
the
time
or
thereafter
did
she
so
much
as
mention
it
berry
confessed
later
that
he
had
been
frightened
to
death
three
kilometres
out
there
was
a
bend
and
the
needle
of
the
speedometer
which
after
rising
steadily
had
come
to
rest
against
the
stop
retreated
momentarily
to
record
we
sang
past
a
wayside
farm
dropped
into
a
valley
soared
up
the
opposite
side
flashed
in
and
out
of
an
apparently
deserted
village
shot
up
a
long
incline
and
slowed
up
for
a
curve
then
some
poultry
demanded
consideration
as
we
left
them
behind
the
agitation
of
two
led
horses
necessitated
a
still
further
reduction
of
speed
we
lost
such
time
as
i
had
made
and
more
also
still
we
were
going
downhill
and
as
if
impatient
of
the
check
the
car
sprang
forward
we
rose
from
the
bottom
with
the
smooth
rush
of
a
elevator
as
we
breasted
the
rise
i
saw
another
and
steeper
dale
before
us
the
road
was
becoming
a
switchback
at
the
top
of
the
opposite
hill
was
a
big
grey
cabriolet
coming
towards
us
at
the
foot
was
a
panting
lorry
going
our
way
an
approaching
ford
was
about
to
pass
it
the
cabriolet
and
pong
fell
down
their
respective
slopes
the
ford
was
abreast
of
the
lorry
and
the
cabriolet
was
prepared
to
pass
the
two
when
we
arrived
it
was
a
question
of
giving
way
at
least
it
ought
to
have
been
it
was
however
too
late
happily
there
was
more
room
than
time
at
our
disposal
a
very
little
more
there
was
no
time
at
all
for
one
instant
there
were
four
vehicles
in
a
row
i
doubt
if
an
ordinary
matchbox
could
have
been
passed
between
our
and
that
of
the
cabriolet
i
could
certainly
have
touched
the
lorry
had
i
put
out
my
hand
then
we
swept
on
and
up
and
over
the
crest
thereafter
all
was
plain
sailing
as
we
ran
into
peyrehorade
i
glanced
at
my
watch
i
had
lost
my
bet
by
about
a
quarter
of
a
minute
but
for
the
led
horses
we
should
have
run
to
time
upon
one
matter
we
were
all
agreed
and
that
was
that
the
driver
of
the
grey
cabriolet
was
going
much
too
fast
so
soon
as
we
had
passed
through
the
town
berry
and
i
changed
places
almost
immediately
the
road
deteriorated
its
fine
straightforward
rolling
nature
was
maintained
the
surface
however
was
in
tatters
after
ten
kilometres
of
misery
my
slowed
up
and
stopped
then
he
turned
to
me
have
you
ever
driven
upon
this
road
sic
before
i
shook
my
head
well
you
can
start
now
was
the
reply
i
fed
up
i
am
rather
drive
on
the
beach
with
that
he
opened
his
door
oh
and
give
me
back
that
cigar
courage
i
said
detaining
him
it
ca
last
pardon
me
said
berry
but
it
can
last
for
blistering
leagues
i
know
these
roads
besides
my
right
knee
getting
tremulous
it
quite
good
practice
i
ventured
what
for
was
the
bitter
reply
my
future
estate
possibly
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
it
will
be
my
blithesome
duty
continually
to
back
a
charabanc
with
a
fierce
clutch
up
an
interminable
equivalent
of
the
eiffel
tower
at
present
and
you
were
driving
so
beautifully
said
his
wife
what
not
with
said
her
husband
rather
said
i
ginger
too
what
mean
suspiciously
determination
said
i
hurriedly
not
the
the
same
said
i
all
underhung
sort
of
air
it
was
most
noticeable
berry
slammed
the
door
and
felt
for
the
as
we
bucketed
down
the
next
slope
i
only
wish
he
said
that
we
could
encounter
the
deceitful
monger
responsible
for
including
this
road
among
grands
i
can
stand
but
the
remains
of
a
railway
platform
which
might
have
been
brought
from
one
of
what
we
know
as
stricken
areas
laid
like
linoleum
upon
a
foot
of
brickdust
tend
to
make
you
gird
at
life
incidentally
is
this
fast
enough
for
you
or
are
your
livers
still
sluggish
i
think
said
i
nodding
at
a
huge
pantechnicon
that
we
might
pass
the
furniture
i
know
no
horn
whose
note
is
at
once
so
compelling
and
offensive
as
that
of
the
usher
with
which
pong
was
equipped
i
know
no
din
at
once
so
obliterative
and
as
that
induced
by
the
passage
of
a
french
pantechnicon
towed
at
a
high
speed
over
an
abominable
road
that
the
driver
of
the
tractor
failed
to
hear
our
demand
was
not
remarkable
that
he
should
have
elected
to
sway
uncertainly
along
the
very
crown
of
the
road
was
most
exasperating
three
times
did
berry
essay
to
push
by
three
times
at
the
critical
moment
did
the
tractor
lurch
drunkenly
across
our
bows
and
three
times
did
pong
fall
back
discomfited
the
dust
the
reek
the
vibration
the
pandemonium
were
combining
to
create
an
atmosphere
worthy
of
a
place
in
the
litany
one
senses
were
cuffed
and
buffeted
almost
to
a
standstill
i
remember
vaguely
that
daphne
was
clinging
to
my
arm
wailing
that
it
was
no
good
i
know
i
was
shouting
berry
was
howling
abusive
incoherence
in
execrable
french
we
were
approaching
the
top
of
a
suddenly
the
tractor
swung
away
to
its
right
with
a
yell
of
triumph
my
unwitting
thrust
at
the
gap
pong
leapt
forward
mercifully
there
was
a
lane
on
the
left
and
i
seized
the
wheel
and
wrenched
it
round
at
the
same
time
opening
the
throttle
as
wide
as
i
dared
i
fancy
we
took
the
corner
on
two
wheels
as
we
did
so
a
pale
blue
racer
streaked
by
our
with
the
roar
of
an
avalanche
when
daphne
announced
that
if
she
reached
biarritz
alive
she
should
drive
home
with
jonah
i
was
hardly
surprised
it
was
perhaps
an
hour
later
that
after
passing
bayonne
we
came
to
her
smart
little
sister
and
the
villa
we
sought
the
great
were
open
but
ping
was
without
in
the
road
while
jonah
was
leaning
languidly
against
the
wall
as
we
slowed
up
he
took
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
i
should
drive
in
he
said
they
out
wo
be
back
before
six
the
servants
say
black
as
was
the
evidence
against
him
my
stoutly
refused
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
affair
all
the
way
to
the
hotel
du
palais
he
declared
violently
that
the
engagement
had
been
well
and
truly
made
and
that
if
evelyn
and
her
husband
chose
to
forget
all
about
it
that
was
no
fault
of
his
finally
when
jonah
suggested
that
after
luncheon
we
should
return
to
the
villa
and
inquire
whether
we
had
indeed
been
expected
the
day
before
he
assented
with
disconcerting
alacrity
as
we
passed
into
the
restaurant
and
i
do
the
interrogating
he
concluded
i
do
want
any
of
your
leading
questions
quite
expect
we
were
expected
yesterday
were
we
all
sweet
and
slimy
with
a
note
in
the
middle
distance
how
dare
you
said
daphne
besides
i
be
only
too
relieved
to
find
it
was
their
mistake
blow
your
relief
replied
her
husband
what
about
my
bleeding
heart
i
not
much
of
a
physician
said
i
but
there
some
cold
stuffed
venison
on
the
sideboard
i
do
know
whether
that
judiciously
administered
berry
shook
his
head
i
doubt
it
he
said
mournfully
i
doubt
it
very
much
still
he
looked
round
hungrily
we
can
always
try
we
were
at
the
villa
again
within
the
hour
almost
immediately
we
elicited
the
information
that
major
and
swetecote
had
spent
the
previous
day
at
san
sebastian
turning
a
withering
and
glassy
eye
in
our
direction
my
explained
the
position
and
desired
permission
to
enter
and
write
a
note
this
was
granted
forthwith
my
sister
and
i
followed
him
into
a
pleasant
salon
meekly
enough
when
he
had
written
his
letter
he
read
it
to
us
with
the
air
of
a
cardinal
evelyn
lest
we
forget
i
know
but
you
should
be
more
careful
old
friends
like
us
too
disgraceful
i
call
it
to
have
been
unprepared
to
receive
us
would
have
been
bad
enough
but
to
be
actually
absent
from
home
well
as
wordsworth
says
that
bent
i
tell
you
that
in
the
belief
that
she
was
to
enjoy
a
free
lunch
my
beloved
who
is
just
now
very
hot
upon
economy
forewent
her
breakfast
and
arrived
upon
your
threshold
faint
and
ravening
you
will
conceive
the
emotion
with
which
she
hailed
the
realization
that
that
same
hunger
which
she
had
encouraged
could
only
be
appeased
at
an
expensive
that
is
bless
your
married
life
i
have
hustled
a
valuable
internal
combustion
engine
over
one
of
the
vilest
roads
in
europe
twice
risked
a
life
the
loss
of
which
would
as
you
know
lower
half
the
flags
in
bethnal
green
and
postponed
many
urgent
and
far
more
deserving
calls
upon
my
electric
personality
i
was
for
instance
to
have
had
my
hair
hearing
of
your
absence
the
unnatural
infidel
above
referred
to
charged
this
to
my
account
as
is
my
humble
wont
i
bent
my
head
to
the
storm
strong
in
the
fearless
confidence
that
france
is
france
and
that
late
as
we
were
the
bar
would
not
be
tell
me
more
of
yourself
i
hear
you
say
may
not
be
one
thing
that
venison
has
made
me
sleepy
secondly
i
am
just
off
to
find
a
suitable
and
sheltered
grove
within
sound
of
the
atlantic
where
i
may
spend
an
hour
in
meditation
thirdly
i
live
for
wants
to
know
if
your
husband
can
play
golf
he
does
of
course
but
can
he
dear
old
friend
happen
to
know
who
owns
a
large
grey
cabriolet
with
a
plate
i
imagine
it
lives
at
biarritz
anyway
they
ought
to
be
prosecuted
driving
about
the
country
like
a
drunken
hornet
mercifully
we
were
crawling
otherwise
i
tell
you
it
made
my
not
at
the
time
of
the
pine
woods
were
wholly
delightful
the
lisp
of
the
wind
among
the
branches
the
faint
thunder
of
the
atlantic
the
soft
sweet
atmosphere
showed
us
a
side
of
biarritz
which
we
should
have
been
sorry
to
miss
by
rights
if
music
and
perfume
have
any
power
we
should
have
fallen
asleep
the
air
however
prevented
us
here
was
an
inspiriting
lullaby
a
laced
with
cordial
we
plucked
the
fruit
from
off
the
tree
of
drowsiness
ate
it
and
felt
refreshed
repose
went
by
the
board
we
left
the
cars
upon
the
road
and
went
strolling
think
you
could
get
me
that
spray
said
jill
suddenly
in
my
cousin
eyes
flora
have
only
to
be
inaccessible
to
become
desirable
remembering
this
i
did
as
berry
and
jonah
were
doing
stared
straight
ahead
and
hoped
very
hard
that
she
was
not
speaking
to
me
boy
yes
dear
think
you
could
by
the
time
i
had
torn
my
trousers
strained
my
right
shoulder
sworn
three
times
and
ruined
the
appearance
of
my
favourite
brogues
the
others
were
out
of
sight
thanks
awfully
boy
you
are
good
to
me
and
that
look
lovely
in
the
the
worst
of
it
is
this
stuff
wilts
almost
at
once
seems
almost
a
shame
to
have
picked
it
i
said
grimly
does
it
it
does
really
jill
agreed
never
mind
she
added
cheerfully
slipping
an
arm
through
mine
it
was
my
fault
subduing
a
desire
to
lie
down
on
my
back
and
scream
i
relighted
my
pipe
and
we
strolled
forward
a
country
walk
with
jill
is
never
dull
to
do
the
thing
comfortably
you
should
be
followed
by
a
file
of
pioneers
in
marching
order
a
limbered
waggon
and
a
portable
pond
before
we
had
covered
another
two
hundred
yards
i
had
collected
three
more
sprays
two
ferns
and
a
square
foot
of
moss
the
latter
much
to
the
irritation
of
its
inhabitants
many
of
whom
refused
to
evacuate
their
homes
and
therefore
accompanied
us
i
drew
the
line
at
frogs
on
the
score
of
cruelty
to
animals
but
when
we
met
one
about
the
size
of
a
postage
stamp
it
was
a
very
near
thing
finally
against
my
advice
my
cousin
stormed
a
bank
caught
her
foot
in
an
invisible
wire
and
fell
flat
upon
her
face
there
now
i
cried
testily
dropping
our
spoils
and
scrambling
to
her
assistance
i
not
a
bit
hurt
she
cried
getting
upon
her
feet
not
a
scrap
and
and
do
be
angry
with
me
boy
jonah
been
cross
all
day
he
says
my
skirt
is
too
short
and
it
is
is
it
not
when
you
do
fall
down
said
i
at
least
well
it
is
rather
is
it
jill
put
her
feet
together
and
drew
the
cloth
close
about
her
silk
stockings
it
fell
perhaps
one
inch
below
her
knees
for
a
moment
she
regarded
the
result
then
she
looked
up
at
me
and
put
her
head
on
one
side
i
have
grown
up
with
jill
i
have
seen
her
in
habits
in
in
i
have
seen
her
hair
up
and
i
have
seen
it
tumbled
about
her
shoulders
i
have
seen
her
grave
and
i
have
seen
her
gay
i
have
seen
her
on
horseback
and
i
have
seen
her
asleep
but
never
in
all
my
life
shall
i
forget
the
picture
which
at
this
moment
she
made
one
thick
golden
tress
shaken
loose
by
her
fall
lay
curling
down
past
the
bloom
of
her
cheek
on
to
her
shoulder
the
lights
in
it
blazed
from
beneath
the
brim
of
her
small
hat
her
great
grave
eyes
held
mine
expectantly
the
stars
in
them
seemed
upon
the
edge
of
dancing
her
heightened
colour
the
poise
of
her
shapely
head
the
parted
lips
lent
to
that
exquisite
face
the
air
of
an
elf
all
the
sweet
grace
of
a
child
was
welling
out
of
her
maidenhood
her
frock
fitted
the
form
of
a
shepherdess
her
pretty
grey
legs
and
tiny
feet
were
those
of
a
fairy
its
very
artlessness
trebled
the
attraction
of
her
pose
making
his
sudden
way
between
the
boughs
the
sun
flung
a
warm
bar
of
light
athwart
her
white
throat
and
the
fallen
curl
nature
was
honouring
her
darling
it
was
the
accolade
i
could
have
sworn
that
behind
me
somebody
breathed
madonna
but
although
i
swung
round
and
peered
into
the
bushes
i
could
see
no
one
when
you
quite
done
said
jill
clearly
she
had
noticed
nothing
i
returned
to
my
cousin
yes
i
said
it
too
short
just
a
shade
as
for
you
you
much
too
sweet
altogether
something
have
to
be
done
about
it
be
stolen
by
fairies
or
translated
or
inveigled
into
an
engagement
or
something
jill
let
her
dress
go
and
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
you
and
berry
and
jonah
she
said
are
far
too
sweet
to
me
and
oh
i
can
see
myself
in
your
eye
boy
i
can
really
for
a
moment
she
stared
at
the
reflection
i
do
think
i
look
very
nice
she
added
gravely
however
she
kissed
me
abstractedly
and
started
to
fix
the
tress
errant
if
jonah
asks
you
do
say
it
too
short
it
not
good
for
him
i
have
it
lengthened
all
right
for
the
second
time
i
began
to
relight
my
pipe
after
examining
the
scene
of
her
downfall
the
witch
caught
at
a
slip
of
a
bough
and
swung
herself
athletically
to
the
top
of
the
bank
thence
she
turned
a
glowing
face
in
my
direction
no
i
sha
after
all
she
announced
it
much
too
convenient
twenty
minutes
later
we
reached
the
point
from
which
we
had
set
out
adèle
was
awaiting
us
with
ping
as
soon
as
we
saw
her
good
heavens
cried
jill
i
quite
forgot
you
were
married
you
ought
to
have
been
with
adèle
she
ran
to
the
car
adèle
darling
what
do
you
think
of
me
i
am
blind
said
adèle
with
jealousy
anyone
would
be
and
now
jump
in
berry
has
taken
the
others
to
look
at
la
barre
and
we
to
follow
them
such
of
the
landscape
as
i
was
bearing
was
thereupon
bestowed
in
the
boot
i
followed
my
cousin
into
the
car
and
a
few
minutes
later
we
were
at
the
mouth
of
the
adour
here
we
left
ping
beside
pong
and
proceeded
to
join
three
figures
on
the
horizon
apparently
absorbed
in
the
temper
of
a
fretful
sea
as
we
tramped
heavily
over
the
shingle
you
not
cross
with
me
adèle
why
should
i
be
darling
well
you
see
panted
jill
i
known
him
so
long
and
he
still
so
exactly
the
same
that
i
ca
always
remember
that
he
not
your
property
said
my
wife
but
he
is
and
always
will
be
jill
looked
at
her
gravely
but
he
yours
she
said
adèle
laughed
lightly
subjects
marry
of
course
she
said
smiling
but
they
only
one
queen
which
i
think
was
uncommon
handsome
any
way
i
kissed
her
slight
fingers
as
we
reached
our
companions
i
could
stay
here
for
ever
said
berry
easily
but
i
not
going
to
the
wind
annoys
me
and
the
sea
not
what
it
was
before
the
war
how
can
you
said
daphne
she
stretched
out
a
pointing
arm
just
look
at
that
one
that
great
big
fellow
it
must
be
the
ninth
wave
nothing
to
the
york
ham
i
mean
the
welsh
harp
on
a
dirty
night
replied
her
husband
why
i
remember
once
in
the
confusion
of
a
precipitate
retreat
before
the
menace
of
the
roller
the
reminiscence
was
lost
it
was
certainly
a
magnificent
spectacle
there
was
a
heavy
sea
running
and
the
everlasting
battle
between
the
river
and
the
atlantic
was
being
fought
with
long
swift
spasms
of
unearthly
fury
continually
recurring
shock
mellay
and
rally
overlapped
attack
and
repulse
were
inextricably
mingled
the
very
lulls
between
the
paroxysms
were
big
with
wrath
there
was
a
point
too
where
the
river
bank
became
coastline
a
blunt
corner
of
land
which
seemed
to
exasperate
the
sea
out
of
all
reason
a
stiff
breeze
abetting
them
the
gigantic
waves
crashed
upon
it
with
a
concussion
that
shook
the
air
all
the
royal
rage
of
ocean
seemed
to
be
concentrated
on
this
little
prominence
the
latter
indifference
appeared
to
aggravate
its
assailant
majesty
was
in
a
tantrum
with
the
exception
of
berry
we
could
have
watched
the
display
till
as
they
say
the
cows
come
home
my
however
felt
differently
the
wind
was
offending
him
after
a
violent
denunciation
of
this
element
besides
he
added
we
ought
to
be
getting
back
it
nearly
three
and
if
we
to
avoid
the
playground
of
the
tanks
and
return
by
bidache
we
shall
be
longer
upon
the
road
well
you
go
on
said
daphne
ask
adèle
nicely
first
if
take
my
place
and
then
if
she
minds
starting
now
fair
lady
he
said
vay
ith
long
the
vind
ith
cold
it
maketh
me
feel
infernal
i
sorry
said
adèle
hurriedly
but
i
left
my
purse
at
home
try
my
husband
berry
put
on
his
hat
cocked
it
and
turned
to
me
want
a
thick
ear
he
demanded
or
will
you
go
quietly
a
little
more
i
retorted
and
you
ride
in
the
dickey
ten
minutes
later
pong
was
sailing
into
the
outskirts
of
bayonne
to
emerge
from
the
town
upon
the
briscous
road
proved
unexpectedly
hard
the
map
insisted
that
we
should
essay
a
dark
entry
by
the
side
of
which
a
forbidding
dared
us
to
come
on
adèle
and
i
pored
over
the
print
while
out
of
our
bickering
berry
plucked
such
instructions
as
his
fancy
suggested
and
alternately
advancing
and
retiring
cruised
to
and
fro
about
a
gaunt
church
after
a
while
we
began
to
ask
people
listen
carefully
to
their
advice
thank
them
effusively
and
then
demonstrate
to
one
another
that
they
were
certainly
ignorant
and
probably
hostile
at
length
how
many
times
inquired
berry
did
they
walk
round
jericho
before
the
walls
went
thirteen
i
think
said
adèle
why
oh
nothing
was
the
reply
only
if
you
are
quick
we
shall
have
this
church
down
besides
i
getting
giddy
then
show
some
initiative
i
retorted
right
said
berry
darting
up
a
calling
upon
him
to
stop
adèle
and
i
fought
for
the
map
a
sudden
lurch
to
the
left
flung
us
into
the
corner
whence
before
we
had
recovered
our
equilibrium
a
violent
swerve
to
the
right
returned
us
at
last
in
response
to
our
menaces
berry
slowed
up
before
a
its
legend
was
plain
briscous
we
stared
at
it
in
silence
then
we
stared
at
one
another
finally
we
stared
at
berry
the
latter
spread
out
his
hands
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
instinct
he
said
just
instinct
it
very
wonderful
hereditary
of
course
one
of
my
uncles
was
a
preventer
with
the
aid
of
a
and
a
false
nose
he
could
find
a
swamp
upon
an
empty
stomach
they
tried
him
once
for
fun
at
a
nobody
could
understand
the
host
uneasiness
until
amid
a
scene
of
great
excitement
my
uncle
found
the
cesspool
under
the
refreshment
marquee
eventually
we
persuaded
him
to
proceed
for
a
while
the
going
was
poor
but
after
we
had
passed
briscous
all
cause
for
complaint
vanished
not
only
was
the
surface
of
the
road
as
good
as
new
but
the
way
itself
was
winsome
the
main
road
to
peyrehorade
could
not
compare
with
it
at
every
twist
and
turn
and
there
were
many
some
fresh
attraction
confronted
us
the
countryside
shy
of
the
great
highways
crept
very
close
we
slipped
up
lanes
ran
side
by
side
with
brooks
brushed
by
snug
cottages
dingles
made
bold
to
share
with
us
their
shelter
their
sweet
prospects
hamlets
their
quiet
content
an
amazing
sundown
set
our
cup
brimming
that
this
might
run
over
bidache
itself
gave
us
a
chateau
ruined
desolate
and
superb
there
is
a
stateliness
of
which
death
holds
the
patent
and
then
again
time
can
be
kind
to
the
dead
what
death
had
given
time
had
magnified
years
had
added
to
the
grey
walls
a
peace
a
dignity
a
charm
such
as
they
never
knew
while
they
were
kept
the
grave
beauty
of
the
place
was
haunting
we
passed
on
reluctantly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
we
ran
into
peyrehorade
here
adèle
relieved
my
and
encouraged
by
the
promise
of
a
late
tea
made
the
most
of
the
daylight
eighty
minutes
later
we
slid
into
pau
as
we
swept
up
the
drive
of
our
villa
well
said
berry
i
must
confess
it
been
a
successful
day
if
we
lunched
with
evelyn
we
should
have
missed
that
venison
and
if
the
main
road
had
been
vile
we
should
have
missed
bidache
indeed
provided
no
is
furnished
by
the
temperature
of
the
i
think
we
may
congratulate
ourselves
adèle
and
i
agreed
enthusiastically
falcon
met
us
in
the
hall
with
a
note
and
a
telephone
message
the
first
was
from
swetecote
daphne
awful
of
you
never
mind
i
know
how
terribly
easy
it
is
to
forget
and
now
you
must
come
over
to
us
instead
falcon
insisted
that
you
would
wish
us
to
have
lunch
so
we
did
a
jolly
good
one
too
and
jack
smoked
one
of
berry
cigars
and
of
course
we
both
lost
our
hearts
to
nobby
in
fact
we
made
ourselves
thoroughly
at
loving
try
and
find
out
who
staying
at
pau
with
a
blue
coupé
they
went
by
us
like
a
flash
of
lightning
fortunately
we
were
going
dead
slow
so
it
was
all
right
but
they
ought
to
be

sir

you

i
asked
captain

where
like
you
to
meet
sir
but
said
know
from
pau
to
la
barre
is
seventy
miles
as
near
as
it
i
covered
the
distance
alone
all
the
way
a
memory
kept
whispering
above
the
rush
of
the
tires
chapter
v
how
love
came
to
jill
herbert
to
the
rescue
and
a
young
man
by
his
right
a
week
of
fine
days
had
slipped
by
most
of
these
we
had
spent
upon
the
open
road
for
fifty
miles
about
pau
we
had
proved
the
countryside
and
found
it
lovely
this
day
we
had
determined
to
fare
farther
afield
perhaps
because
of
this
decision
trouble
had
peered
out
of
the
bushes
before
we
had
gone
twenty
miles
had
we
however
been
advised
to
expect
a
puncture
and
requested
to
select
the
venue
we
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
delightful
spot
immediately
upon
our
right
there
was
a
garden
trim
and
pleasing
as
the
farmhouse
it
served
stretched
in
the
gateway
lay
a
large
white
hound
regarding
us
sleepily
beyond
on
the
greensward
a
peacock
preened
himself
in
the
hot
sunshine
on
the
left
a
wayside
bank
made
a
parapet
and
a
score
of
a
sweet
balustrade
a
glance
between
these
natural
balusters
turned
our
strip
of
metalling
into
a
gallery
the
car
indeed
was
standing
upon
the
edge
of
a
brae
whether
this
fell
sheer
or
sloped
steeply
could
not
be
seen
for
the
first
thing
which
the
eye
encountered
was
a
vast
plain
rich
rolling
three
hundred
feet
below
north
south
and
east
as
far
as
the
sight
could
follow
was
stretching
lilliput
meadows
and
poplars
and
the
flash
of
streams
steadings
and
villages
coppices
flocks
and
curling
roads
glinted
or
glowed
in
miniature
close
on
our
right
two
toy
towers
stood
boldly
up
to
grace
a
townlet
due
east
a
long
straight
baby
avenue
led
to
a
midget
city
northward
a
tiny
train
stole
like
a
snail
into
the
haze
of
distance
far
to
the
south
the
mountains
blurred
snowy
ethereal
rose
like
a
beckoning
dream
to
point
the
fairy
tale
it
was
only
when
we
had
gloated
upon
the
prospect
for
several
minutes
identified
the
townlet
as
ibus
and
the
city
as
tarbes
and
taking
out
powerful
binoculars
subjected
the
panorama
to
a
curious
scrutiny
which
might
have
shattered
the
illusion
but
only
turned
lilliput
into
utopia
that
we
pulled
ourselves
together
and
started
to
consider
our
plight
this
was
not
serious
a
tire
was
flat
certainly
but
we
had
two
spare
wheels
i
drew
a
sou
from
my
pocket
and
spun
it
into
the
air
i
maintain
said
berry
that
the
obverse
will
bite
the
dust
the
coin
tinkled
to
a
settlement
and
we
both
stooped
to
read
our
respective
fates
a
moment
later
with
a
grin
i
climbed
back
into
the
car
whilst
berry
removed
his
coat
with
awful
deliberation
jill
was
in
possession
of
the
paper
so
i
lighted
a
cigarette
and
turned
up
tarbes
in
the
just
listen
to
this
said
my
cousin
suddenly
the
four
properties
the
villa
irikli
is
the
most
notable
a
traveller
once
styled
it
fairest
jewel
in
diadem
occupying
one
of
the
choicest
situations
on
the
famous
lake
surrounded
by
extensive
gardens
the
varied
beauty
of
which
beggars
description
the
palace
for
it
is
nothing
less
has
probably
excited
more
envy
than
any
dwelling
in
europe
then
it
speaks
about
the
house
wait
a
minute
here
we
are
lawns
stretching
to
the
very
edge
of
the
lake
the
magnificent
cedars
the
sunlit
terraces
the
cascades
the
chestnut
groves
the
orange
and
lemon
trellises
the
exquisite
prospects
go
to
the
making
of
a
veritable
does
that
sound
maddening
it
does
indeed
i
agreed
whose
is
it
i
do
know
said
jill
absently
staring
into
the
distance
but
i
can
just
see
it
all
fancy
living
there
and
going
out
before
breakfast
over
the
lawns
to
bathe
idly
i
took
the
paper
out
of
her
hand
from
this
it
appeared
that
the
property
had
belonged
to
the
duke
of
padua
reading
further
i
found
that
the
latter
whole
estate
had
upon
his
death
nine
months
ago
become
the
subject
of
an
action
at
law
the
deceased
legitimacy
it
seemed
had
been
called
in
question
the
appeal
court
of
italy
was
to
declare
the
true
heir
as
i
laid
down
the
sheet
somebody
i
said
will
drink
champagne
oranges
and
lemons
murmured
jill
cascades
a
vicious
grunt
from
below
and
behind
suggested
that
my
was
standing
no
nonsense
i
settled
myself
in
my
corner
of
the
car
tilted
my
hat
over
my
nose
and
closed
my
eyes
the
sound
of
voices
aroused
me
your
silly
eyes
did
you
hear
me
say
man
you
strip
the
blinkin
thread
look
here
oui
oui
monsieur
je
comprends

you
do
listen
said
berry
severely
that
what
the
matter
with
you
valuable
car
like
this
too
jill
buried
her
face
in
my
sleeve
and
began
to
shake
with
laughter
en

brave

very
hot

every
time
said
berry

the

said
berry
gravely

mais
de

was
the
airy
reply
but
you
must
take
off
that
worried
look
me
rappelle

terrible
et

my
dear
herbert

and
now
suppose
we
resume
our
improvement
of
the
working
day
except
for
the
laboured
breathing
of
herbert
the
remaining
bolts
were
affixed
in
silence
said

herbert
that

a
yell
of
protest
from

that

been

the
reverent
look
with
which
herbert
favoured
me
as
he
returned
to
his
oxen
i
shall
never
forget
clearly
to
be
in
the
arms
of
dionysus
by
eleven
in
the
morning
was
arguing
at
once
an
affluence
and
a
discretion
which
were
almost
sacred
ah
said
berry
making
his
appearance
you
awake
are
you
just
finished
herbert
been
watching
me
have
you
got
the
there
it
it
tiring
work
what
is
said
i
grimly
instructing
that
it
said
my
i
explained
as
i
went
along
herbert
was
most
interested
a
little
dense
you
know
but
such
a
nice
fellow
he
thinks
the
world
of
you
now
i
think
the
in
the
in
you
get
said
i
starting
the
engine
philanthropy
and
beer
do
go
together
with
his
foot
upon
the
step
berry
regarded
me
i
should
like
herbert
ruling
on
that
he
said
besides
i
got
a
thirst
which
is
above
rubies
think
what
it
be
like
by
said
jill
besides
she
added
searching
for
her
bag
i
got
some
acid
drops
somewhere
with
an
unearthly
shriek
berry
clawed
at
his
temples
for
a
moment
he
rocked
to
and
fro
agonisedly
then
he
climbed
heavily
into
the
car
as
he
sank
back
against
the
cushions
murderess
he
said
and
it
was
the
best
i
had
since
egypt
two
hours
later
we
ran
into
montrejeau
crept
by
its
exquisite
market
roofed
and
pillared
and
carrying
its
four
hundred
years
as
they
were
forty
dropped
down
a
wicked
hill
and
swept
over
an
infant
garonne
on
to
the
luchon
road
before
we
had
covered
five
kilometres
we
sighted
our
goal
city
that
is
set
on
a
hill
can
not
be
hid
out
of
the
blowing
meadows
rose
up
an
eminence
but
for
the
heights
beyond
you
would
have
called
it
a
mountain
its
slopes
were
timbered
and
if
there
was
a
road
there
this
could
not
be
seen
high
up
above
the
trees
was
a
city
wall
standing
out
boldly
as
ramparts
should
within
the
wall
still
higher
were
houses
white
ancient
and
there
clear
above
them
all
perched
upon
the
very
point
of
the
hill
towered
a
cathedral
the
size
of
it
turned
the
city
into
a
close
its
site
its
bulwarks
however
turned
the
church
into
a
castle
here
was
an
abbot
filling
the
post
of
constable
the
longer
you
gazed
the
stronger
the
paradox
became
pictures
of
peace
and
war
became
inextricably
confused
mumbled
their
offices
steel
caps
concealed
tonsures
embrasures
framed
precious
panes
trumpets
sounded
the
angelus
mail
chinked
beneath
vestments
sallies
became
processions
sentinels
cried
plainly
most
venerable
the
tiny
city
and
the
tremendous
church
made
up
a
living
relic
of
whose
possession
memory
can
be
very
proud
ranks
with
the
leaning
tower
of
pisa
there
is
nothing
like
it
in
all
the
world
presently
we
passed
through
the
meadows
climbed
up
the
slopes
and
came
to
a
little
terrace
under
the
full
in
the
sunlight
sheltered
from
the
wind
the
pleasaunce
made
an
ideal
refectory
the
view
of
the
mountains
moreover
which
it
afforded
was
superb
i
stole
by
the
city
gate
and
berthed
pong
close
to
the
low
parapet
ten
minutes
later
ping
drew
up
behind
us
is
this
just
lovely
cried
adèle
applying
the
it
unique
said
i
advancing
how
did
the
car
go
like
a
train
said
jonah
helping
daphne
to
alight
i
may
add
that
i
enjoyed
being
driven
oh
jonah
how
nice
of
you
cried
adèle
it
was
indeed
a
compliment
worth
having
i
told
you
so
i
said
unctuously
and
now
said
berry
if
you
quite
done
scratching
one
backs
vulgar
brute
said
daphne
i
beg
your
pardon
my
sister
repeated
the
appellative
instantly
her
husband
assumed
an
attitude
of
listening
ecstasy
hark
he
exclaimed
dramatically
i
my
calling
a
rapturous
smile
swept
into
his
face
it
must
be
time
he
changed
his
tone
to
one
of
indicative
solicitude
more
to
the
left
sweet
chuck
no
that
the
i
got
the
pram
here
a
master
of
pantomime
berry
can
create
an
atmosphere
with
a
look
and
a
word
the
halls
he
would
probably
be
a
complete
failure
on
the
terrace
beneath
the
walls
of
bertrand
he
was
simply
daphne
and
jonah
included
we
collapsed
tearfully
as
we
did
so
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
behind
us
one
and
all
we
turned
blindly
about
to
see
a
slim
figure
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
dash
for
the
gateway
as
we
looked
a
grey
hat
flew
off
the
next
moment
its
owner
was
within
the
walls
i
ran
to
the
gateway
and
stared
up
a
little
paved
street
it
was
quite
empty
after
a
moment
i
returned
to
pick
up
the
hat
looking
at
this
i
saw
that
it
came
from
bond
street
what
was
more
remarkable
was
that
twenty
paces
away
was
standing
a
grey
it
was
quite
evident
that
for
car
and
passenger
to
approach
without
our
knowledge
we
must
have
been
extremely
preoccupied
and
the
engine
uncannily
silent
after
some
discussion
of
the
incident
we
placed
the
hat
in
the
and
proceeded
to
lunch
the
meal
was
over
and
jonah
and
i
were
washing
the
glasses
when
now
no
please
said
my
i
read
it
all
up
where
we
are
now
was
the
whatever
that
said
jill
the
said
berry
the
monks
used
to
come
and
howl
here
before
breakfast
what
did
they
howl
for
said
adèle
it
was
a
form
was
the
reply
of
mortification
instituted
by
aitchless
the
and
encouraged
by
his
successor
who
presented
an
empty
but
still
fragrant
to
be
howled
for
upon
michaelmas
eve
after
the
manner
of
a
guide
the
speaker
preceded
us
to
the
gateway
and
now
we
come
to
the
gate
originally
its
present
width
it
was
widened
by
the
orders
of
gilbert
the
gluttonous
the
work
in
which
he
took
the
deepest
interest
was
carried
out
under
his
close
supervision
indeed
it
was
not
until
the
demolition
of
the
structure
had
been
commenced
that
he
was
able
to
be
released
from
a
position
which
was
embarrassing
not
only
his
digestion
but
his
peace
of
mind
inasmuch
as
it
was
denying
ingress
to
a
cardinal
who
had
much
influence
at
the
vatican
and
was
wearing
tight
boots
the
steep
narrow
street
was
walled
by
great
houses
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
while
at
the
top
a
little
archway
buttressed
a
mansion
of
obvious
importance
we
now
enter
said
berry
with
the
flourish
of
the
hired
conductor
the
famous
bishops
row
at
one
time
or
another
in
every
one
of
these
dwellings
prelates
of
all
sizes
and
shapes
have
snored
swallowed
and
generally
fortified
the
flesh
upon
that
door
were
posted
the
bulletins
announcing
the
progress
towards
recovery
of
rudolph
the
rash
who
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
his
office
decided
to
take
a
bath
his
eventual
restoration
to
health
was
celebrated
with
great
rejoicing
from
that
window
sandwich
surnamed
the
was
wont
to
dispense
charity
in
the
shape
of
such
sack
as
he
found
himself
reluctantly
unable
to
consume
such
surprised
even
his
most
devoted
adherents
until
it
was
discovered
that
the
bishop
had
no
idea
that
he
was
pouring
libations
into
the
street
but
with
some
hazy
intention
of
conserving
the
remains
of
his
liquor
invariably
mistook
the
window
for
the
door
of
a
cupboard
the
house
on
the
left
is
of
peculiar
interest
behind
those
walls
i
would
interrupt
you
for
worlds
said
daphne
and
i
sure
the
cathedral
wo
be
half
so
interesting
but
perhaps
if
we
saw
that
first
that
right
said
her
husband
twist
the
sage
tail
now
lost
my
place
i
shall
have
to
begin
all
over
again
he
paused
to
pass
his
hand
across
his
eyes
then
he
flung
out
an
arm
we
now
enter
the
famous
bishops
row
at
one
time
or
another
in
every
one
of
these
dwellings
prelates
of
all
we
fairly
fled
up
the
street
we
had
visited
the
shrine
we
had
wondered
at
the
silver
eloquence
of
architects
we
had
examined
one
by
one
of
the
most
exquisite
stalls
that
ever
graced
a
choir
we
had
stared
at
thrones
pulpit
and
a
great
frieze
all
of
them
carved
with
a
cunning
which
money
could
never
buy
and
great
love
and
piety
are
too
poor
to
purchase
we
had
walked
in
the
cloisters
we
had
been
shown
the
relics
and
whilst
the
others
were
picking
over
some
picture
postcards
i
was
looking
at
an
old
fountain
in
the
cathedral
square
i
say
said
a
pleasant
voice
upon
the
other
side
of
the
basin
was
a
slim
figure
in
a
grey
tweed
suit
a
boy
of
about
twenty
summers
his
thick
dark
hair
was
uncovered
and
there
was
a
grave
look
in
the
big
brown
eyes
hullo
said
i
you
the
runaway
that
right
he
said
quickly
i
only
want
to
apologise
afraid
i
was
awfully
rude
to
laugh
like
that
but
i
could
help
it
i
was
listening
he
turned
away
hurriedly
here
i
say
i
cried
stepping
after
him
with
his
chin
on
his
shoulder
the
boy
hesitated
like
some
wild
thing
do
go
i
added
it
quite
all
right
if
my
likes
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
why
should
you
laugh
i
know
but
my
dear
fellow
said
i
the
more
the
merrier
besides
we
use
the
same
hatter
so
let
be
friends
you
all
alone
are
you
er
yes
i
really
staying
at
pau
and
as
i
got
nothing
i
knew
i
seen
your
car
before
did
you
go
to
lourdes
on
tuesday
the
boy
started
yes
sir
i
i
think
i
did
he
was
really
extraordinarily
nervous
that
right
i
continued
we
were
on
the
way
back
from
cauterets
by
the
way
i
see
you
got
one
of
the
new
models
how
does
she
go
we
walked
down
to
the
gate
talking
easily
enough
by
the
time
the
others
arrived
the
bonnet
was
open
and
i
had
promised
to
teach
him
to
change
speed
without
taking
out
the
clutch
is
that
sweet
said
jill
voice
my
companion
started
upright
you
like
it
he
said
flushing
i
think
it
wonderful
said
my
cousin
so
it
was
i
have
seen
many
mascots
but
seated
upon
the
cap
of
the
radiator
a
little
silver
reproduction
of
the
ares
ludovisi
knocked
memories
of
nymphs
hounds
and
urchins
into
a
cocked
hat
i
like
you
to
have
it
said
the
boy
suddenly
which
is
your
car
oh
but
i
ca
take
it
cried
jill
breathlessly
it
awfully
generous
of
you
but
i
could
think
of
well
let
just
see
how
it
looks
you
were
in
the
first
car
you
it
was
about
a
thousand
to
one
against
the
two
caps
being
interchangeable
but
the
miracle
came
off
once
ares
was
in
his
new
seat
nothing
would
induce
his
owner
to
disestablish
him
keep
him
at
least
he
insisted
please
do
i
think
it
it
bring
me
luck
you
awfully
kind
said
jill
why
did
you
run
away
daphne
took
my
arm
and
called
berry
together
we
strolled
up
the
terrace
jonah
was
showing
adèle
the
points
of
the
who
said
my
sister
is
this
attractive
youth
i
not
the
faintest
idea
said
i
but
he
staying
at
pau
well
jill
got
off
was
the
reply
they
like
a
couple
of
children
ah
said
berry
unexpectedly
what
on
earth
the
matter
said
daphne
listen
rejoined
her
husband
i
laid
an
egg
metaphorically
we
all
terrified
of
jill
getting
pinched
again
metaphorically
are
we
very
good
let
encourage
this
friendship
let
it
swell
into
an
attachment
they
far
too
young
to
think
about
marriage
of
course
we
sha
see
so
much
of
her
but
as
the
sainted
martin
said
half
a
cloak
better
than
no
bags
dear
lad
said
daphne
slipping
her
arm
through
his
you
not
laying
at
all
you
getting
broody
with
that
she
turned
to
me
and
what
do
you
think
about
it
he
a
gentleman
said
i
and
he
a
child
children
i
suppose
attract
children
let
him
be
asked
to
tea
and
they
can
play
in
the
nursery
thank
you
said
my
sister
now
i
break
it
to
you
subject
to
the
usual
formalities
jill
will
marry
that
boy
within
the
year
it
absurd
bubbled
berry
it
out
of
the
question
be
like
the
babes
in
the
wood
what
that
doing
on
his
own
i
ca
imagine
i
should
think
he
a
ward
in
chancery
who
given
his
guardians
the
slip
and
the
two
together
make
a
combination
about
as
well
fitted
to
cope
with
life
as
a
mute
with
a
megaphone
on
the
contrary
said
daphne
they
get
on
splendidly
turn
the
world
into
a
playground
wherever
they
go
everybody
drop
their
tools
and
go
down
on
their
knees
and
play
with
them
she
laughed
delightedly
i
tell
you
it
be
like
a
fairy
tale
of
course
i
said
i
see
what
it
is
you
at
your
old
games
i
not
was
the
fierce
retort
think
i
want
to
lose
jill
but
she
have
to
go
some
day
it
inevitable
and
the
only
thing
she
could
ever
really
love
is
a
playmate
the
finest
lover
in
the
world
would
never
find
the
trick
of
jill
heart
only
a
child
can
do
that
she
might
marry
him
easily
the
lover
i
mean
and
she
be
happy
of
course
but
she
miss
the
biggest
thing
in
life
well
eligible
playmates
are
pretty
scarce
i
been
watching
for
one
for
years
mind
you
i
do
say
this
boy
going
to
do
there
may
be
a
score
of
reasons
that
put
his
suit
out
of
court
but
on
the
face
of
it
he
nearer
the
mark
than
anything
i
seen
thoughtfully
we
turned
back
the
way
we
had
come
after
a
long
silence
any
way
said
berry
gloomily
the
first
thing
to
do
to
find
out
who
he
is
perhaps
jill
done
it
that
said
my
sister
is
the
very
last
thing
she
think
of
we
returned
to
where
ping
and
pong
were
standing
to
find
that
jonah
and
adèle
had
disappeared
while
jill
was
being
taught
to
drive
the
the
environs
of
do
not
make
a
good
school
but
master
and
pupil
cared
not
for
that
indeed
they
were
so
engrossed
in
their
exercise
that
our
approach
was
unobserved
the
two
were
at
the
top
of
their
bent
flushed
with
excitement
laughing
chattering
like
old
friends
lady
and
squire
were
having
the
time
of
their
lives
they
were
certainly
wonderfully
matched
if
jill
was
a
picture
so
was
the
boy
his
gravity
was
gone
the
fine
frank
face
was
fairly
alight
with
happiness
the
brown
eyes
dancing
the
strong
white
teeth
flashing
merriment
from
being
he
had
become
most
handsome
if
he
was
to
find
the
trick
of
jill
heart
she
had
laid
a
pink
finger
upon
the
catch
of
his
charm
for
a
moment
we
stood
marvelling
then
jill
saw
us
with
the
tail
of
her
eye
i
say
she
cried
twittering
he
going
to
teach
me
to
drive
coming
to
lunch
and
then
we
going
along
the
morlaas
road
because
that
be
quiet
as
adèle
and
jonah
emerged
from
the
gateway
you
ca
have
the
morlaas
road
said
berry
because
got
it
i
going
to
practise
reversing
through
goats
it
all
arranged
five
million
of
the
best
goats
are
to
be
in
line
of
troop
columns
two
kilometres
south
of
the
of
a
by
three
jill
addressed
her
companion
we
go
another
way
she
said
i
do
suppose
he
really
going
there
but
if
he
did
well
when
he
says
he
going
backwards
on
purpose
we
always
get
out
of
the
car
the
naïveté
with
which
this
unconsciously
scathing
criticism
was
phrased
and
uttered
trebled
its
poignancy
berry
collapsed
amid
a
roar
of
laughter
then
jonah
pulled
out
his
watch
and
we
began
to
arrange
ourselves
that
jill
might
return
with
her
brother
and
have
her
mascot
too
we
had
to
swap
cars
for
as
the
only
two
mechanics
jonah
and
i
never
travelled
together
i
was
sorry
about
it
for
pong
was
the
apple
of
my
eye
seldom
if
ever
had
we
been
parted
before
jonah
i
fancy
felt
the
same
about
ping
our
new
friend
was
going
straight
back
we
however
were
proposing
to
return
by
and
suggested
that
he
should
accompany
us
he
shook
his
head
gravely
no
i
i
have
to
get
back
he
said
heavily
i
must
then
he
bowed
to
daphne
and
to
us
all
you
been
very
kind
to
me
as
he
turned
till
i
cried
heartily
you
know
where
we
live
oh
yes
you
captain
pleydell
that
right
oh
and
er
by
the
way
i
do
think
we
know
your
name
for
a
moment
the
boy
hesitated
then
he
turned
scarlet
do
i
he
said
it
was
four
by
the
time
we
reached
lannemezan
so
after
a
little
discussion
my
wife
and
berry
and
i
determined
to
cut
out
of
our
itinerary
and
return
to
pau
by
the
way
by
which
we
had
come
whether
the
others
who
were
ahead
of
us
had
come
to
the
same
decision
we
could
not
tell
berry
was
driving
like
a
professional
the
fact
however
that
between
lannemezan
and
tarbes
the
pleasant
road
was
littered
with
more
and
than
one
would
have
expected
any
three
departments
of
france
to
be
able
to
furnish
tended
to
cramp
his
style
the
uses
moreover
to
which
the
occupants
of
these
vehicles
subjected
the
way
argued
a
belief
not
so
much
in
progress
as
in
de
as
often
as
not
the
carts
moved
three
abreast
their
human
complements
comparing
excited
notes
gossiping
and
making
merry
with
as
much
disregard
of
their
whereabouts
as
if
they
were
gathered
in
a
familiar
tavern
as
for
the
waggons
these
were
frequently
unattended
their
custodians
trudging
disinterestedly
in
rear
absorbed
in
argument
and
leaving
their
bullocks
to
place
their
own
interpretation
upon
the
rule
of
the
road
such
confidence
was
seldom
misplaced
still
for
the
driver
of
an
approaching
car
to
share
it
demanded
i
suppose
an
experience
of
oxen
which
we
did
not
possess
after
a
few
miles
my
patience
began
to
show
signs
of
wear
and
tear
and
by
the
time
we
had
reached
tournay
it
was
positively
threadbare
for
this
adèle
and
i
paid
almost
as
heavily
as
he
but
for
the
horn
by
his
side
many
an
infuriated
chauffeur
would
have
lost
his
reason
it
is
a
kind
of
berry
employment
of
this
convenient
accessory
was
characterised
by
a
savagery
which
if
deplorable
is
not
uncommon
the
frequency
however
with
which
passage
simply
had
to
be
asked
was
truly
terrible
disapproval
at
once
so
bitterly
and
constantly
expressed
was
most
distressing
our
heads
began
to
ache
violently
to
crown
our
annoyance
we
picked
up
a
cast
shoe
with
the
inevitable
result
when
fortified
by
the
knowledge
that
it
was
my
turn
to
change
the
wheel
berry
ventured
to
point
out
that
such
an
acquisition
was
extremely
fortunate
the
power
of
speech
deserted
me
dusk
was
falling
as
we
ran
into
tarbes
think
said
adèle
that
we
could
find
a
chemist
my
head
feels
as
if
it
was
going
to
burst
we
sought
diligently
without
success
after
a
little
we
stopped
and
asked
a
postman
an
apothecary
of
sorts
it
appeared
was
plying
his
trade
two
away
adèle
and
i
descended
to
go
and
visit
him
i
was
rather
sceptical
about
the
virtue
of
the
drug
which
was
eventually
produced
to
us
but
after
a
little
discussion
we
purchased
the
tablets
and
asked
for
some
water
with
which
to
swallow
them
i
must
confess
that
when
we
returned
to
find
no
sign
of
the
car
i
was
extremely
annoyed
it
was
rapidly
growing
dark
and
it
had
become
cold
adèle
was
tired
and
had
had
no
tea
the
market
was
up
with
the
result
that
the
streets
were
swarming
i
cursed
my
with
pardonable
acerbity
it
all
right
old
chap
said
adèle
taking
my
arm
he
probably
just
around
somewhere
let
go
and
look
for
him
he
was
not
around
anywhere
we
struggled
to
the
right
we
fought
our
way
to
the
left
we
pushed
and
were
pushed
back
to
the
and
we
returned
laboriously
to
our
all
the
time
we
were
devilled
by
the
lingering
idea
that
berry
was
searching
for
us
and
that
we
were
just
avoiding
him
at
every
turn
after
another
two
minutes
i
took
my
protesting
wife
back
to
the
chemist
shop
requested
his
hospitality
on
her
behalf
and
after
seeing
her
received
by
a
glowing
frenchwoman
into
an
inner
room
turned
up
my
collar
and
advanced
blasphemously
into
the
street
almost
immediately
berry
stumbled
into
my
arms
car
he
gasped
plant
quick
or
they
do
us
down
i
stared
at
him
stupidly
his
coat
was
torn
and
he
was
streaming
with
sweat
also
his
hat
was
missing
and
there
was
a
cut
on
his
cheek
you
hurt
i
cried
right
as
rain
he
panted
tell
you
we
go
he
started
to
pelt
up
the
street
i
ran
by
his
side
two
minutes
after
gone
fellow
ran
up
t
the
car
in
hell
of
a
state
firs
couldn
make
out
what
matter
was
talked
too
fast
then
gathered
you
sent
him
adèle
had
been
taken
ill
lie
of
course
see
now
never
occurred
to
me
at
time
told
him
get
on
step
and
guide
me
burst
off
up
street
lef
ri
lef
stunt
knew
where
i
was
cul
de
sac
pulled
up
nex
second
both
doors
open
and
toughest
cove
ever
seen
told
me
t
hop
it
in
bad
american
round
to
t
left
here
course
i
tumbled
at
once
dirty
work
tried
t
hit
him
nothing
doing
tried
to
lock
car
could
hauled
out
anyhow
no
good
yelling
ran
find
you
one
ray
hope
out
of
petrol
i
never
stopped
engine
petered
out
on
its
own
can
on
step
i
know
but
they
have
to
locate
trouble
and
then
decant
left
again
here
no
wait
he
looked
from
side
to
side
anxiously
then
he
swung
round
and
glanced
back
gad
i
think
wrong
he
started
back
frantically
no
that
right
i
that
café
we
swung
round
again
arrived
once
more
at
the
corner
again
he
hesitated
twitching
his
lips
nervously
and
sobbing
for
want
of
breath
these
blasted
streets
he
jerked
out
i
tried
to
memorise
but
they
are
boy
there
they
are
it
was
true
turning
away
from
us
into
a
street
on
our
left
about
forty
paces
away
was
our
own
blue
coupé
but
for
the
fact
that
a
cart
was
presenting
a
momentary
obstruction
our
quarry
would
have
been
gone
as
it
was
i
flung
myself
on
to
the
as
she
was
gathering
speed
without
a
word
i
thrust
my
arm
in
at
the
window
and
switched
off
the
engine
as
she
slowed
up
i
leapt
for
the
bonnet
whipped
it
open
and
felt
for
the
wire
at
that
moment
the
engine
for
a
second
whoever
was
driving
fumbled
with
the
gears
as
the
wheels
meshed
with
a
chunk
my
fingers
found
what
they
sought
the
next
instant
the
car
lunged
forward
and
the
wire
broke
i
fell
on
my
back
certainly
and
my
hand
was
bleeding
but
i
could
afford
to
smile
the
gun
was
spiked
as
i
rose
to
my
feet
the
car
came
gently
to
rest
paces
away
all
right
panted
berry
by
my
side
every
time
said
i
and
now
for
it
i
turned
to
a
gaping
youth
cherche
la
police
i
flung
at
him
as
we
came
up
to
the
car
and
may
i
ask
drawled
a
voice
the
meaning
of
this
i
guess
you
get
tired
of
answering
before
you
through
but
as
the
owner
of
this
vehicle
i
just
curious
cut
it
out
said
i
shortly
and
just
come
out
of
that
car
both
of
you
so
far
as
the
speaker
companion
was
concerned
my
injunction
was
supererogatory
even
as
i
spoke
with
a
scream
of
agony
the
latter
emerged
from
the
car
holding
him
fast
by
the
wrist
berry
had
almost
broken
his
arm
across
the
jamb
of
the
door
and
why
said
the
voice
imperturbably
because
the
game
up
i
opened
the
door
besides
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
rather
particular
about
our
cushions
till
now
no
one
with
more
than
three
previous
convictions
has
ever
sat
on
them
with
narrowed
eyes
a
very
gentleman
regarded
me
grimly
if
you
had
damaged
my
car
he
said
slowly
i
get
out
and
refashion
your
physiognomy
but
i
guess
i
wait
for
the
police
and
with
that
he
drew
a
cigar
from
his
pocket
bit
off
the
end
spat
and
then
lighted
the
brand
with
great
deliberation
i
began
to
think
rapidly
violence
was
out
of
the
question
the
fellow
was
far
heavier
than
i
and
obviously
as
hard
as
nails
moreover
i
felt
instinctively
that
the
queensberry
rules
did
not
mean
much
to
him
as
for
cunning
well
we
were
not
in
the
same
class
here
was
an
audacity
such
as
i
had
not
dreamed
of
having
lost
one
throw
the
fellow
was
doubling
his
stake
hook
having
broken
in
his
hand
he
had
dropped
it
and
picked
up
crook
game
was
to
bluff
the
french
that
was
why
he
was
staying
in
the
car
to
give
the
impression
of
ownership
if
he
could
maintain
this
impression
make
it
easy
for
the
police
to
wash
their
hands
of
a
dispute
between
foreigners
so
find
favour
in
their
eyes
just
turn
the
scale
sufficiently
to
be
allowed
to
proceed
pending
the
fullest
inquiries
it
might
go
hard
with
us
i
fancy
he
read
my
thoughts
for
he
took
the
cigar
from
his
mouth
and
laughed
softly
up
against
it
are
you
he
said
at
last
a
arrived
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
all
on
the
way
to
the
this
was
not
to
my
gentleman
taste
but
he
was
too
shrewd
a
knave
to
press
his
point
honesty
was
his
best
policy
he
did
demand
hotly
that
i
should
be
taken
in
charge
but
i
had
the
better
of
him
in
french
and
after
a
moment
he
let
that
iron
go
he
fought
very
hard
for
the
services
of
a
mechanic
but
i
was
determined
that
the
engine
should
remain
out
of
action
and
calling
for
volunteers
upon
the
crowd
of
unlookers
soon
satisfied
the
that
to
push
the
car
to
the
station
was
easy
enough
holding
fast
to
the
accomplice
who
for
reasons
best
known
to
himself
was
adopting
an
injured
air
in
sulky
silence
berry
walked
by
my
side
what
his
game
he
muttered
in
the
face
of
our
papers
he
done
he
swear
they
his
for
a
monkey
they
in
the
car
probably
read
them
through
while
you
were
looking
for
me
and
all
the
details
are
on
the
travelling
pass
but
he
got
to
get
over
the
photograph
well
it
up
to
you
said
berry
i
used
to
think
i
could
bluff
but
this
this
is
beyond
me
when
we
arrived
at
the
the
chief
of
the
police
was
summoned
and
we
told
our
respective
tales
our
enemy
spoke
first
shortly
but
much
to
the
point
he
was
returning
he
said
to
pau
where
he
was
staying
with
friends
finding
that
he
had
run
out
of
petrol
while
he
was
passing
through
tarbes
he
had
turned
into
a
to
refill
without
obstructing
a
main
thoroughfare
as
he
was
starting
again
an
assault
had
been
made
an
unprovoked
assault
seriously
damaging
the
car
thereupon
he
had
sent
for
the
police
now
foiled
in
their
enterprise
the
thieves
he
understood
were
actually
daring
to
say
that
he
had
assaulted
them
one
of
them
he
nodded
at
berry
had
certainly
been
roughly
handled
but
mon
dieu
what
did
they
expect
here
he
took
out
his
watch
and
frowned
at
the
dial
and
now
would
the
police
get
to
work
his
friends
at
pau
would
be
wondering
what
had
become
of
him
i
admit
that
you
could
have
pushed
me
over
upon
the
question
of
ownership
the
rogue
said
not
a
word
the
whole
onus
of
raising
that
issue
he
had
thrust
on
to
me
i
was
to
broach
the
barrel
of
improbability
and
by
so
doing
to
taint
my
whole
case
the
police
were
manifestly
impressed
there
was
no
doubt
at
all
that
we
were
up
against
it
the
asperity
with
which
the
official
asked
me
what
we
had
to
say
sent
my
heart
into
my
boots
i
started
to
tell
my
story
the
moment
i
said
that
the
car
belonged
to
us
police
and
robber
stared
at
me
as
if
bewitched
then
the
latter
exploded
it
was
certainly
very
well
done
such
fulminations
of
outraged
dignity
such
of
righteous
indignation
never
were
witnessed
it
took
the
united
sympathy
and
assurance
of
the
whole
personnel
of
the
station
to
smooth
the
ruffian
down
after
a
while
however
he
condescended
to
see
the
humorous
side
the
police
laughed
with
him
throughout
my
recital
i
had
to
endure
the
like
as
for
the
chief
of
police
he
was
plainly
extremely
bored
he
listened
patently
because
it
was
his
duty
to
let
me
speak
his
cold
indifferent
air
the
way
in
which
his
eyes
went
straying
about
the
room
were
simply
maddening
desperately
endeavouring
to
keep
my
temper
i
ploughed
my
way
on
at
last
listen
i
said
dramatically
you
do
not
believe
me
i
do
not
blame
you
my
friend
has
told
a
good
tale
at
present
it
is
my
word
against
his
supposing
i
bring
some
evidence
what
evidence
can
you
bring
the
papers
belonging
to
the
car
i
pointed
to
the
usurper
on
his
own
showing
i
can
not
have
seen
them
yet
i
will
tell
you
their
contents
i
pray
you
send
for
them
they
in
the
left
wrong
sonny
said
my
antagonist
tapping
his
coat
i
always
carry
here
and
with
that
he
drew
out
our
wallet
and
flung
it
upon
the
desk
with
our
pass
in
his
hands
the
chief
of
the
police
blinked
at
me
the
chassis
number
he
said
p
up
went
his
eyebrows
and
on
the
xd
the
official
folded
the
pass
and
shook
his
head
wrong
he
said
shortly
as
i
stared
at
him
frowning
yes
sonny
said
the
jeering
voice
an
do
go
putting
it
up
that
you
mansel
the
picture
against
you
with
the
words
the
truth
came
to
me
it
was
ping
jonah
car
that
was
standing
without
in
the
street
i
had
given
pong
with
a
grin
of
triumph
the
impostor
rose
to
his
feet
so
that
that
he
drawled
well
i
guess
i
be
moving
as
for
these
climbers
pardon
me
sir
said
berry
in
pretty
fair
french
but
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
sort
he
turned
to
the
chief
of
the
police
and
inclined
his
head
i
am
a
nobleman
and
i
should
like
a
chair
for
a
moment
the
other
stared
at
him
then
he
sent
for
a
seat
had
i
stood
in
his
shoes
i
should
have
done
the
same
my
air
was
irresistible
berry
sat
down
carefully
i
shall
not
he
said
keep
you
long
this
is
not
my
car
it
belongs
to
my
cousin
captain
jonathan
mansel
look
at
the
pass
please
and
check
me
captain
mansel
was
born
at
guildford
surrey
is
it
not
so
good
now
i
have
given
the
birthplace
he
shot
out
an
accusing
hand
that
gentleman
the
for
the
second
time
the
tough
exploded
but
with
a
difference
this
time
the
wrath
was
genuine
the
passion
real
there
was
something
beastly
about
it
beside
this
paroxysm
the
other
outburst
had
been
almost
refined
the
official
who
had
been
about
to
speak
looked
at
the
fellow
curiously
and
when
a
moment
later
the
latter
stretched
out
his
hand
for
the
pass
he
held
up
a
prohibitive
palm
as
the
storm
died
down
good
said
berry
the
gentleman
does
want
to
the
date
is
december
the
fifteenth
he
sighed
profoundly
then
you
have
a
here
he
said
musingly
called
jean
laffargue
the
chief
of
the
police
stared
yes
he
is
there
by
the
door
berry
nodded
he
has
a
twin
brother
has
he
perfectly
he
is
called
very
likely
said
berry
very
likely
i
call
him
le
said
herbert
stepping
into
the
room
ah
herbert
said
berry
airily
we
meet
again
he
nodded
at
the
official
just
tell
this
gentleman
about
this
morning
will
you
he
would
i
think
be
interested
to
say
that
herbert
came
up
to
the
scratch
is
to
do
scant
justice
to
the
testimony
which
he
gave
and
to
the
manner
in
which
he
gave
it
he
swore
to
berry
he
swore
to
me
and
in
all
honesty
he
swore
to
the
car
for
this
since
ping
and
pong
were
duplicates
he
may
be
forgiven
he
described
the
morning
incident
with
a
wealth
of
picturesque
detail
and
an
abundance
of
vivid
imagery
while
an
astute
only
served
to
adorn
the
sincerity
of
his
tale
finally
in
response
to
his
entreaties
police
and
all
we
followed
him
into
the
street
where
displaying
a
histrionic
ability
which
was
truly
french
he
proceeded
to
reconstruct
and
rehearse
his
great
adventure
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
zealot
watch
in
hand
berry
touched
the
chief
of
the
police
upon
the
shoulder
by
now
he
said
i
think
my
cousin
may
have
reached
pau
if
you
would
like
to
telephone
he
stopped
suddenly
to
peer
right
and
left
into
the
darkness
the
gentry
had
disappeared
ten
minutes
later
with
a
on
either
step
we
picked
up
an
anxious
adèle
then
we
filled
up
with
petrol
had
my
makeshift
connection
replaced
by
a
new
wire
and
started
for
home
as
we
passed
the
scene
of
our
meeting
with
herbert
which
goes
to
prove
said
my
the
wisdom
of
catching
at
straws
i
noticed
his
likeness
to
herbert
the
moment
we
entered
the
room
and
for
what
it
was
worth
i
kept
my
eye
on
him
then
a
came
in
and
whispered
i
caught
the
words
laffargue
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
glanced
at
the
clock
it
looked
as
if
his
brother
was
waiting
for
him
to
come
off
duty
i
began
to
wonder
whether
the
two
were
going
to
blow
my
ten
francs
during
one
of
the
arguments
i
shot
my
bolt
i
asked
him
to
tell
his
that
the
count
blowfly
was
here
and
would
be
glad
if
he
wait
he
stared
rather
but
after
a
little
hesitation
he
slipped
out
of
the
room
i
think
my
heart
stopped
beating
until
he
returned
when
he
looked
at
me
and
nodded
i
could
have
screamed
with
delight
for
a
kilometre
or
so
we
sat
in
silence
then
it
reminds
me
of
poker
on
board
ship
said
i
our
friend
of
the
square
jaw
cuts
in
and
with
the
luck
of
an
outsider
picks
up
four
kings
that
it
said
berry
and
we
hold
three
aces
exactly
said
i
but
four
kings
beat
three
aces
said
adèle
you
forgetting
herbert
said
i
no
i
not
said
my
wife
herbert
the
ace
of
spades
no
sweetheart
said
berry
he
the
joker
it
was
early
upon
the
following
morning
that
a
letter
was
brought
by
hand
to
our
door
pleydell
afraid
you
must
have
thought
all
sorts
of
things
about
me
after
i
gone
yesterday
but
i
just
this
moment
had
a
telegram
and
so
excited
i
can
hardly
write
i
know
my
name
now
you
see
i
used
to
be
the
marquis
lecco
then
when
father
died
they
said
he
never
been
the
duke
at
all
and
so
i
had
no
name
but
now
it
all
settled
and
they
lost
their
case
and
i
can
sign
myself
always
very
sincerely
chapter
vi
how
berry
ran
contraband
goods
and
the
duke
of
padua
plighted
jill
his
troth
that
jill
was
in
love
with
the
duke
of
padua
was
only
less
manifest
than
that
the
duke
of
padua
was
in
love
with
jill
something
however
was
wrong
so
much
our
instinct
reported
our
reason
refused
to
believe
it
and
with
one
consent
we
pretended
that
all
was
well
for
all
that
there
lay
a
shadow
athwart
the
babies
path
yet
the
sky
was
cloudless
the
thing
was
too
hard
for
us
with
a
sigh
i
opened
my
case
and
took
out
a
cigarette
then
i
handed
the
case
to
berry
the
latter
waved
it
aside
and
wrinkled
his
nose
i
through
he
said
shortly
offal
all
very
well
in
an
incinerator
if
the
wind
the
right
way
but
as
a
substitute
for
tobacco
well
it
soon
palls
i
closed
the
case
and
slid
it
into
my
pocket
i
must
confess
i
said
that
i
nearing
the
well
i
wish
you
be
quick
and
reach
it
said
adèle
how
you
can
go
on
at
all
after
finding
that
fly
i
ca
imagine
she
shuddered
at
the
memory
less
than
a
week
ago
a
suspicious
protuberance
in
the
line
of
a
local
cigarette
had
attracted
my
attention
investigation
had
revealed
the
presence
of
a
perfect
if
somewhat
withered
specimen
of
the
imbedded
in
the
vegetation
which
i
had
been
proposing
to
smoke
this
was
too
much
for
the
girls
none
of
whom
had
since
touched
a
cigarette
and
when
my
suggested
that
the
fly
had
probably
desired
cremation
and
urged
that
however
obnoxious
the
wishes
of
the
dead
should
be
respected
daphne
had
reviled
her
husband
and
requested
jonah
to
open
the
door
so
that
she
could
sit
in
a
draught
we
were
in
a
bad
way
now
that
we
were
in
france
the
difficulty
of
obtaining
cigars
cigarettes
or
tobacco
such
as
we
were
used
to
enjoy
seemed
to
be
insuperable
the
prohibitive
duty
the
uncertainty
and
by
no
means
infrequent
failure
of
the
french
mails
brought
the
cost
of
procuring
supplies
from
england
to
a
figure
we
could
not
stomach
attempts
at
postal
smuggling
had
ended
in
humiliating
failure
the
wares
which
france
herself
was
offering
were
not
at
all
to
our
taste
we
were
getting
desperate
jonah
who
had
smoked
the
same
mixture
for
thirteen
years
was
miserable
berry
affection
for
a
certain
brand
of
cigars
became
daily
more
importunate
my
liver
was
suffering
we
better
try
getting
a
licence
to
import
i
said
heavily
it
may
do
something
ah
said
my
drawing
a
letter
from
his
pocket
i
knew
i
had
some
news
for
you
i
heard
from
george
this
morning
i
admit
i
do
often
take
advice
but
this
little
missive
sounds
an
unusually
compelling
call
all
do
not
be
inveigled
into
obtaining
or
worse
still
acting
upon
a
to
import
it
is
a
have
i
got
one
when
i
was
in
paris
gleefully
ordered
five
thousand
cigarettes
from
bond
street
and
started
to
count
the
days
i
soon
got
tired
of
that
three
months
later
i
got
a
dirty
form
from
the
customs
advising
me
that
there
was
a
case
of
cigarettes
addressed
to
me
lying
on
the
wharf
at
toulon
yes
toulon
they
added
that
the
charges
to
be
paid
before
collection
amounted
to
nine
hundred
francs
by
way
of
duty
eleven
hundred
and
by
way
of
freight
and
another
three
francs
forty
for
every
day
they
remained
in
the
custom
house
in
this
connection
they
begged
to
point
out
that
they
had
already
lain
there
for
six
weeks
friend
can
you
beat
it
but
what
then
did
i
do
why
i
took
appropriate
action
i
wrote
at
once
saying
that
as
i
was
shortly
leaving
for
new
york
i
should
be
obliged
if
they
would
forward
them
via
liverpool
to
the
piraeus
i
inquired
whether
they
had
any
objection
to
being
paid
in
roubles
and
i
advised
them
that
i
was
shortly
expecting
a
pantechnicon
purporting
to
contain
furniture
but
in
reality
full
of
mines
these
i
begged
them
to
handle
with
great
care
and
to
keep
in
a
temperature
never
higher
than
degrees
fahrenheit
as
they
were
notoriously
sensitive
and
i
particularly
wished
to
receive
them
intact
i
added
that
the
pantechnicon
would
be
consigned
to
me
under
another
name
a
fair
knowledge
of
the
french
temperament
suggests
to
me
that
the
next
two
or
three
furniture
vans
which
arrive
at
toulon
will
be
very
stickily
i
threw
away
my
cigarette
and
stared
at
the
mountains
every
prospect
pleases
i
murmured
only
fags
are
vile
the
only
thing
to
do
said
adèle
is
to
have
a
little
sent
out
from
england
from
time
to
time
and
ration
yourselves
accordingly
berry
shook
his
head
easier
to
stop
altogether
he
said
tobacco
not
like
food
not
speaking
of
the
stuff
you
get
here
some
of
that
is
extremely
like
food
of
a
sort
i
should
think
it
would
as
they
say
lovely
neither
is
it
like
liquor
you
do
carry
a
flask
or
a
bottle
of
beer
in
your
more
the
pity
but
nobody
equipment
is
complete
without
a
case
or
a
pouch
why
so
that
the
moment
this
particular
appetite
asserts
itself
it
can
be
gratified
no
smoking
a
vice
and
as
soon
as
you
clap
a
vice
in
a
it
loses
its
charm
a
cigar
three
times
a
day
after
meals
does
cut
any
ice
with
me
he
tilted
his
hat
over
his
eyes
and
sank
his
chin
upon
his
chest
and
now
do
talk
for
a
bit
i
want
to
concentrate
adèle
laid
a
hand
upon
his
arm
one
moment
she
said
if
the
car
arrives
before
you
finished
are
we
to
interrupt
you
certainly
not
darling
signal
to
the
driver
to
stop
in
the
middle
distance
oh
and
ask
approaching
pedestrians
to
keep
on
the
grass
should
any
children
draw
near
advise
their
nurse
that
i
have
the
mumps
we
were
sitting
upon
a
seat
in
the
parc
beaumont
revelling
in
the
temper
of
the
sunshine
and
the
perfection
of
the
air
a
furlong
away
daphne
jill
and
jonah
were
playing
tennis
with
piers
duke
of
padua
to
make
a
fourth
nobby
and
a
were
gambolling
upon
an
adjacent
lawn
pau
has
many
virtues
all
but
one
of
which
may
i
suppose
be
severally
encountered
elsewhere
upon
the
earth
the
one
however
is
her
peculiar
the
place
is
airy
yet
windless
high
though
she
stands
and
clear
by
thirty
miles
of
such
shelter
as
the
mountains
can
give
by
some
queer
trick
of
nature
upon
the
map
of
æolus
pau
and
her
pleasant
precincts
are
shown
as
forbidden
ground
there
is
no
stiff
breeze
to
rake
the
boulevard
there
are
no
gusts
to
buffet
you
at
corners
there
are
no
draughts
in
the
streets
the
flow
of
sweet
fresh
air
is
rich
and
steady
but
it
is
never
stirred
a
mile
away
you
may
see
dust
flying
storm
and
tempest
savage
the
pyrenees
upon
the
gentlest
day
fidgety
puffs
fret
biarritz
as
puppies
plague
an
old
hound
but
pau
is
sanctuary
once
in
a
long
long
while
some
errant
blast
blunders
into
the
town
then
for
a
second
of
time
the
place
is
bedlam
the
uncaught
shutters
are
slammed
the
unpegged
laundry
is
sent
whirling
and
if
the
time
is
evening
the
naked
flames
of
lamps
are
blown
out
but
before
a
match
can
be
lighted
the
air
is
still
again
and
nobody
cares
it
was
an
accident
and
pau
knows
it
probably
the
gust
had
lost
its
way
and
was
frightened
to
death
such
a
thing
will
not
happen
again
for
two
or
three
months
i
like
piers
said
adèle
suddenly
but
i
think
he
might
kiss
my
hand
how
dare
you
said
i
i
do
really
said
adèle
he
kisses
daphne
and
he
actually
kisses
jill
that
all
wrong
said
i
you
do
kiss
a
maiden
hand
of
course
you
do
grunted
berry
a
son
of
italy
but
he
is
a
son
of
italy
he
english
on
both
sides
i
not
talking
of
his
sides
said
berry
it
a
matter
of
bosom
you
may
have
english
forbears
but
if
they
been
italian
dukes
for
two
centuries
it
just
possible
that
they
imbibed
something
besides
chianti
personally
i
think
it
a
very
charming
custom
it
saves
wiping
your
mouth
and
well
why
does
he
kiss
my
hand
said
adèle
because
sweetheart
you
are
were
american
and
he
very
punctilious
he
probably
thinks
that
a
quondam
citizen
might
have
no
use
for
such
circumstance
i
should
said
adèle
i
should
just
love
it
i
like
piers
i
looked
across
at
my
hear
that
i
inquired
she
likes
him
berry
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
told
her
not
to
marry
you
he
said
no
you
did
said
adèle
you
egged
me
on
oh
you
wicked
story
said
berry
why
i
fairly
spread
myself
on
the
brutality
of
his
mouth
you
said
he
was
honest
sober
and
nonsense
said
berry
i
was
talking
of
somebody
else
i
have
seen
him
sober
of
course
but
besides
you
were
so
precipitate
you
had
an
answer
for
everything
when
i
spoke
of
his
ears
you
said
get
used
to
them
and
when
i
asked
you
if
you
noticed
i
sha
said
adèle
i
mean
i
did
however
it
done
now
and
after
all
he
very
convenient
if
we
had
got
married
i
should
have
wintered
at
pau
and
if
i
had
wintered
at
pau
i
should
have
met
piers
true
said
berry
true
there
something
in
that
he
nodded
in
my
direction
find
he
snores
much
nothing
to
speak
of
said
adèle
used
he
to
like
the
devil
said
berry
the
vibration
was
fearful
we
had
to
have
his
room
underpinned
oh
he
quite
all
right
now
said
my
wife
indeed
as
husbands
go
he
he
very
charming
you
do
mean
to
say
you
still
love
him
i
i
believe
i
do
oh
the
girl
ill
said
berry
put
your
head
between
your
knees
dear
and
think
of
a
bullock
trying
to
pass
through
a
turnstile
and
why
husbands
go
as
a
distinguished
consort
i
must
protest
against
that
irreverent
expression
listen
said
adèle
laughing
all
women
adore
ceremonious
attention
even
americans
the
ceremonious
attentions
of
the
man
they
love
are
the
sweetest
of
all
it
the
tragedy
of
every
happy
marriage
that
when
comradeship
comes
in
at
the
door
ceremony
flies
out
of
the
window
now
my
husband
my
king
once
he
was
my
courtier
i
would
go
back
for
twenty
million
worlds
but
i
got
a
smile
for
the
old
days
i
know
said
berry
softly
i
know
years
ago
daphne
told
me
the
same
and
i
tried
and
tried
but
it
would
work
somehow
she
was
very
sweet
about
it
and
very
wise
she
said
as
far
as
the
i
vowed
i
carry
it
further
but
she
only
smiled
we
retired
there
and
then
ceremoniously
enough
to
dress
for
dinner
i
bathed
and
changed
and
got
as
far
as
my
collar
when
the
stud
fell
down
my
back
i
pinched
it
between
my
at
that
moment
she
came
to
the
door
to
see
if
i
was
ready
he
spread
out
expressive
hands
they
talk
about
the
step
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
we
did
use
any
stairs
we
went
down
in
the
lift
after
that
i
gave
up
trying
a
sense
of
humour
however
has
pulled
us
through
and
now
we
revile
one
another
and
so
you
see
said
adèle
slipping
an
arm
through
mine
piers
has
wares
to
offer
me
which
you
have
the
shame
of
it
is
he
offer
them
still
he
very
nice
the
way
in
which
he
solemnly
takes
us
all
for
granted
is
most
attractive
he
as
natural
as
a
baby
a
year
old
he
just
bows
very
courteously
and
then
joins
in
the
game
the
moment
it
over
he
makes
his
bow
and
retires
we
call
him
piers
he
calls
us
by
our
christian
names
and
we
have
known
him
a
week
it
not
it
just
pure
innocence
i
confess
it
remarkable
said
i
and
i
do
wonder
you
like
him
all
the
same
i
sorry
there
cried
adèle
suddenly
pointing
across
the
lawn
boy
gone
in
again
i
reached
the
edge
of
the
ornamental
water
in
time
to
observe
the
sealyham
emerge
upon
the
opposite
bank
you
naughty
dog
said
i
you
naughty
wicked
dog
nobby
shook
himself
gleefully
no
do
come
across
go
round
the
other
way
go
back
the
dog
hesitated
and
by
way
of
turning
the
scale
i
threw
my
stick
for
him
to
retrieve
as
this
left
my
hand
the
hook
caught
in
my
cuff
and
the
cane
fell
into
as
nobby
climbed
out
with
the
stick
the
arrived
a
crabbed
gentleman
in
a
long
blue
cloak
and
the
deuce
of
a
stew
the
swans
he
said
would
be
frightened
there
was
one
swan
three
hundred
yards
away
always
they
were
being
pursued
by
bold
dogs
but
it
was
shameful
that
hounds
should
march
unled
in
the
parc
beaumont
was
forbidden
absolutely
not
for
them
to
uproot
were
the
trees
and
flowers
planted
where
then
was
my
attachment
and
i
had
encouraged
my
dog
actually
i
had
made
sport
for
him
he
had
seen
the
deed
with
his
eyes
one
paw
raised
ears
pricked
his
little
head
on
one
side
his
small
frame
quivering
with
excitement
his
bright
brown
eyes
alight
with
expectation
a
dripping
nobby
regarded
us
i
took
a
note
from
my
pocket
he
is
a
wicked
dog
i
said
there
he
pays
his
fine
as
for
me
i
shall
be
punished
enough
my
home
is
distant
and
i
was
to
have
driven
now
he
is
wet
and
must
grow
dry
so
i
must
walk
i
will
think
out
his
punishment
as
i
go
and
with
that
i
hooked
my
cane
to
the
delinquent
collar
and
turned
away
the
old
fellow
came
shambling
after
us
but
do
not
punish
him
i
pray
you
nobby
screwed
round
his
head
and
looked
at
him
oh
but
how
handsome
he
is
perhaps
he
did
not
understand
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
nobby
started
towards
him
and
moved
his
tail
see
how
he
understands
he
has
the
eyes
of
a
dove
he
stooped
to
caress
his
ah
but
you
are
cold
my
beauty
unleash
him
i
pray
you
that
he
may
warm
himself
i
shall
not
notice
him
as
i
did
his
bidding
and
nobby
capered
away
he
said
pleasedly
au
revoir
mon
he
straightened
his
bowed
shoulders
and
touched
his
hat
votre
service
i
returned
thoughtfully
to
where
adèle
and
berry
were
sitting
watching
us
closely
and
pretending
that
we
did
not
belong
to
them
so
far
as
personal
magnetism
was
concerned
between
nobby
and
the
duke
of
padua
there
seemed
to
be
little
to
choose
to
judge
by
results
the
two
were
equally
irresistible
in
the
race
for
the
popularity
stakes
the
rest
of
the
males
of
our
party
were
simply
nowhere
with
a
sigh
a
blue
coupé
slid
past
me
and
then
slowed
down
the
grey
behind
it
did
the
same
when
i
say
that
daphne
who
loathes
mechanics
was
seated
in
the
latter
conveyance
submitting
zealously
to
an
oral
examination
by
piers
regarding
the
particular
functions
of
the
various
controls
it
will
be
seen
that
my
recent
conclusions
were
well
founded
letters
said
jill
getting
out
of
the
coupé
one
for
berry
and
two
for
adèle
she
distributed
them
accordingly
fitch
brought
them
up
on
his
bicycle
and
piers
aunt
is
coming
the
one
whose
villa
at
i
forgot
her
name
but
he
says
she
awfully
nice
splendid
said
i
and
now
congratulate
me
having
tramped
the
town
all
the
morning
i
got
to
walk
home
why
i
pointed
to
nobby
that
he
may
warm
himself
i
said
my
cousin
gave
a
horrified
cry
oh
boy
and
we
only
washed
him
last
night
i
take
him
cried
piers
i
like
to
and
you
can
drive
daphne
back
i
shook
my
head
laughing
it
his
master
privilege
i
said
besides
he
had
his
scolding
and
if
i
deserted
him
he
be
hurt
and
he
really
a
good
little
chap
but
my
dear
piers
said
daphne
laying
a
hand
on
his
arm
rather
than
risk
hurting
that
white
scrap
feelings
my
brother
would
walk
to
lyons
you
will
all
said
berry
be
diverted
to
learn
that
i
am
faced
with
the
positively
filthy
prospect
of
repairing
to
london
forthwith
after
spending
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
an
overheated
office
in
new
square
lincoln
inn
in
the
course
of
which
i
shall
make
two
affidavits
which
nobody
will
ever
read
i
shall
be
at
liberty
to
return
give
me
the
laws
of
england
never
mind
old
chap
said
daphne
we
soon
be
back
again
i
shall
go
with
you
of
course
ought
we
to
start
considering
that
there
was
snow
in
london
that
the
visit
would
entail
almost
continuous
travelling
for
nearly
thirty
hours
each
way
and
that
my
sister
can
not
sleep
in
a
train
it
seemed
as
if
berry
at
any
rate
was
pulling
out
of
the
ruck
my
sweet
replied
my
i
wo
hear
of
it
however
we
argue
it
out
in
private
yes
i
must
start
you
must
go
said
jonah
softly
ca
get
out
of
it
right
my
cousin
leaned
out
of
the
car
i
give
you
my
tobacconist
address
the
best
way
will
be
to
have
the
stuff
decanted
and
sewn
in
your
coat
there
was
a
pregnant
silence
then
saved
i
cried
exultantly
saved
what
mean
said
berry
hush
said
i
looking
round
not
an
mute
this
summons
of
yours
is
a
godsend
with
a
little
ingenuity
you
can
bring
enough
contraband
in
to
last
us
till
may
if
our
efforts
to
induce
my
to
see
reason
were
eventually
successful
this
was
no
more
than
we
deserved
we
made
light
of
the
risk
of
detection
we
explained
how
the
stuff
could
be
concealed
we
told
him
the
demeanour
to
assume
we
said
we
wished
we
were
going
we
declared
it
was
done
every
day
we
indemnified
him
against
fines
we
entreated
we
flattered
we
cajoled
we
appealed
to
him
as
a
sportsman
we
said
it
was
only
right
we
looked
unutterable
things
and
at
last
half
an
hour
before
it
was
time
for
him
to
start
for
the
station
he
promised
with
many
misgivings
and
expressions
of
to
see
what
he
could
do
instantly
from
being
his
suppliants
we
became
his
governors
and
the
next
twenty
minutes
were
employed
in
pouring
into
his
ears
the
most
explicit
directions
regarding
his
purchase
and
disposal
of
our
particular
fancies
finally
we
made
out
a
list
he
had
absolutely
refused
to
allow
my
sister
to
accompany
him
but
we
all
went
down
to
the
station
to
see
him
off
as
we
were
pacing
the
platform
have
you
got
the
list
said
jonah
the
same
question
had
been
asked
before
several
times
yes
said
berry
i
have
and
if
anybody
asks
me
again
i
shall
produce
it
and
tear
it
into
shreds
before
their
eyes
well
for
heaven
sake
do
lose
it
said
i
because
to
hear
you
said
berry
anybody
would
think
that
i
was
mentally
deficient
anybody
would
think
that
i
was
going
to
enclose
it
in
a
note
to
the
customs
telling
them
to
expect
me
on
saturday
disguised
in
a
flat
and
a
bag
of
gooseberries
and
advising
them
to
pull
up
their
socks
as
i
should
resist
like
a
madman
i
do
know
what
the
matter
with
you
we
endeavoured
to
smooth
him
down
and
if
purred
daphne
if
there
should
be
any
that
is
what
i
mean
is
should
any
question
arise
berry
laughed
hysterically
yes
he
said
go
on
question
such
as
whether
they
can
give
me
more
than
five
years
hard
labour
i
understand
get
on
the
telephone
to
berwick
he
knows
the
president
personally
and
can
do
anything
sweetheart
replied
her
husband
you
may
bet
your
most
precious
life
if
berwick
was
in
paris
i
would
touch
the
business
with
the
end
of
a
pole
i
wish
i
was
going
with
you
said
daphne
wistfully
berry
took
off
his
hat
you
are
he
said
gently
you
are
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
i
wish
i
could
put
the
tobacco
in
the
same
poor
place
but
impossible
for
one
thing
lady
you
all
the
room
there
is
which
was
pretty
good
for
a
king
who
had
been
a
courtier
for
nearly
nine
years
it
was
upon
the
following
afternoon
that
adèle
who
was
brushing
nobby
sat
back
on
her
heels
when
jill
she
said
becomes
the
duchess
of
padua
what
bloods
we
shall
be
she
is
there
yet
said
i
where
my
sweet
said
i
i
apologise
i
was
using
a
figure
of
speech
which
is
at
once
slipshod
and
american

the
indian
tailor

and
reproduced

tear
in
the
sleeve

be
too
faithful
never
mind
i
forgive

that
nobby
the
terrier
started
to
his
feet

you
hear
what
the
woman

water
adèle
looked
out
of
the
window
and
smiled
at
a
cloud
once
she
said
slowly
once
i
asked
you
if
you
would
have
known
i
was
an
american
and
when
you
said
i
asked
you
why
do
you
remember
your
answer
of
course
she
added
swiftly
that
was
before
we
were
married
you
beautiful
witch
said
i
you
unkind
beautiful
witch
only
to
touch
the
water
with
the
tip
of
your
little
red
tongue
to
make
it
pure
you
only
to
put
your
lips
to
it
to
make
it
the
sweetest
music
that
ever
a
poor
fool
heard
you
only
to
smile
like
that
to
make
me
proud
to
kiss
your
shining
foot
nobby
cried
adèle
oh
nobby
did
you
hear
that
did
you
hear
what
the
man
said
a
real
courtier
speech
but
how
can
he
kiss
my
feet
when
i
sitting
on
them
i
stepped
to
her
side
picked
her
up
and
swung
her
on
to
a
table
then
i
kissed
her
sweet
insteps
from
her
perch
my
wife
addressed
the
sealyham
it
all
right
nobby
she
said
relievedly
he
is
a
king
after
all
only
a
king
would
have
done
that
as
i
sat
down
by
her
side
i
love
to
be
a
queen
cried
a
voice
love
to
would
you
like
to
be
a
king
it
was
jill
speaking
the
fresh
tones
came
floating
up
and
in
at
the
open
window
she
could
not
have
heard
our
words
it
was
pure
coincidence
adèle
and
i
sat
very
still
i
do
know
said
piers
slowly
i
tell
you
what
i
do
said
jill
i
piers
what
is
the
matter
nothing
said
piers
there
is
said
jill
accusingly
you
know
there
is
i
can
see
it
in
your
eyes
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
i
do
know
stammered
her
swain
i
think
you
might
tell
me
said
jill
aggrievedly
i
always
tell
you
everything
once
or
twice
lately
you
got
all
quiet
suddenly
i
ca
think
why
is
it
because
your
aunt
coming
piers
laughed
bitterly
good
heavens
no
he
said
well
why
is
it
then
for
a
moment
there
was
no
answer
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
of
speech
was
pulled
up
oh
jill
jill
jill
i
could
go
on
saying
your
name
for
the
rest
of
my
life
i
say
it
all
the
way
home
i
say
it
as
i
going
to
sleep
i
say
it
when
i
wake
in
the
morning
i
saw
you
first
at
biarritz
you
never
knew
i
was
staying
with
some
italian
people
they
got
a
place
there
and
i
was
alone
in
the
grounds
and
then
i
saw
you
with
boy
you
looked
so
wonderful
all
in
green
you
were
standing
with
your
feet
close
together
and
your
head
on
one
side
your
hair
was
coming
down
and
the
sun
was
shining
on
it
i
found
out
who
you
were
and
came
to
pau
i
wanted
to
get
to
know
you
i
felt
i
must
and
whenever
you
all
went
out
i
followed
in
the
and
then
i
got
to
know
you
at
bertrand
that
wonderful
wonderful
day
i
was
so
awfully
happy
and
now
his
voice
sank
to
a
wail
i
wish
i
had
if
only
i
stopped
to
think
but
i
did
i
just
knew
i
wanted
to
be
with
you
and
that
was
all
oh
he
burst
out
suddenly
why
did
i
ever
do
it
why
did
i
ever
follow
you
that
wonderful
day
if
i
dreamed
how
miserable
it
make
me
how
miserably
wretched
i
be
it
the
dreadful
hopelessness
jill
the
dreadful
hopelessness
but
i
help
it
it
something
stronger
than
me
it
not
enough
to
be
with
you
i
want
to
touch
you
i
want
to
put
my
arms
round
your
neck
i
want
to
play
with
your
hair
of
course
i
terribly
lucky
to
be
able
to
kiss
your
hand
but
ah
do
be
frightened
i
was
only
playing
jill
only
pretending
and
now
i
going
to
be
all
serious
again
not
quiet
but
serious
madonna
have
you
ever
seen
where
the
fellow
bursts
into
tears
i
think
i
could
do
that
part
this
afternoon
a
light
padding
upon
the
gravel
came
to
our
ears
then
a
car
door
slammed
a
moment
later
piers
purred
its
way
down
the
drive
adèle
and
i
continued
to
sit
very
still
presently
i
turned
to
her
and
raised
my
eyebrows
hopelessness
i
whispered
hopelessness
what
on
earth
does
he
mean
my
wife
shrugged
her
shoulders
helplessly
then
she
laid
a
finger
upon
her
lips
i
nodded
obediently
yes
said
berry
you
see
in
me
a
nervous
wreck
my
misfiring
i
over
at
the
knees
and
with
the
slightest
encouragement
i
can
break
into
a
cold
sweat
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
his
eyes
i
had
meant
to
meet
him
at
the
station
but
the
early
train
had
beaten
me
so
fitch
had
gone
with
the
car
indeed
it
was
not
yet
eight
and
daphne
was
still
abed
that
had
not
prevented
us
from
following
berry
into
her
room
any
more
than
had
the
fact
that
no
one
of
us
was
ready
for
breakfast
i
had
no
coat
or
waistcoat
so
far
as
could
be
seen
jonah
was
attired
in
a
burberry
and
a
pair
of
trousers
a
glance
at
adèle
suggested
that
she
was
wearing
a
fur
coat
silk
stockings
and
a
comb
while
jill
was
wrapped
in
a
kimono
with
her
fresh
fair
hair
tumbled
about
her
shoulders
jonah
voiced
our
anxiety
you
you
got
the
goods
they
downstairs
said
berry
but
do
question
me
i
bear
it
i
tell
you
all
in
a
minute
but
you
must
let
me
alone
above
all
do
thwart
me
i
warn
you
my
condition
is
critical
he
sighed
heavily
apparently
impressed
by
his
demeanour
nobby
approached
set
his
paws
upon
his
knee
and
licked
his
face
there
you
are
said
berry
lifting
the
dog
to
his
lap
the
very
fowls
of
the
air
pity
me
no
it
not
a
sore
old
chap
it
where
i
cut
myself
yesterday
but
i
just
as
grateful
and
now
lie
still
my
beauty
and
poor
old
the
smuggler
will
tell
you
such
a
tale
as
will
thicken
your
blood
upon
friday
morning
last
i
purchased
a
not
a
new
one
the
oldest
and
most
relic
i
could
procure
on
friday
evening
i
packed
it
one
thousand
cigars
five
thousand
cigarettes
and
six
pounds
of
tobacco
looked
very
well
in
it
my
sword
a
pair
of
field
boots
breeches
coat
carefully
folded
to
display
the
staff
badges
and
my
red
hat
looked
even
better
i
filled
up
with
socks
shirts
puttees
slacks
spurs
and
all
the
old
emblems
of
mars
that
i
could
lay
my
hands
on
finally
i
leavened
the
lot
with
a
pound
of
the
best
white
pepper
to
discourage
the
moths
my
fellow
to
discourage
the
moths
his
tone
suggesting
the
discomfiture
of
the
wicked
the
sealyham
barked
his
applause
quite
so
well
i
locked
the
case
up
and
corded
it
and
precisely
at
ten
i
retired
to
bed
i
never
remember
feeling
so
full
of
beans
as
i
did
the
next
morning
i
could
have
bluffed
my
way
across
europe
with
a
barrel
of
whiskey
on
a
lead
i
felt
ready
for
anything
sharp
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
i
was
at
the
station
and
one
minute
later
a
porter
with
the
physique
of
a
blacksmith
had
the
box
on
his
shoulder
and
my
in
his
hand
it
was
as
he
was
preparing
to
lay
his
spoils
at
the
feet
of
the
that
my
bearer
trod
upon
a
to
say
that
he
took
a
toss
conveys
nothing
at
all
it
was
the
sort
of
fall
you
dream
of
almost
too
good
to
be
true
and
my
of
which
he
never
let
go
described
a
very
beautiful
parabola
and
then
came
down
upon
the
as
the
swiple
of
an
uplifted
flail
comes
down
upon
grain
both
hinges
went
of
course
it
says
much
for
the
box
that
the
whole
thing
did
melt
then
and
there
if
i
had
corded
it
most
of
the
stuff
would
have
been
all
over
the
vauxhall
bridge
road
well
i
was
so
rattled
that
i
could
hardly
think
i
joined
mechanically
in
the
laughter
i
assured
complete
strangers
that
it
did
matter
at
all
i
carried
through
the
registration
like
a
man
in
a
dream
and
i
tipped
everybody
i
could
see
it
was
as
i
was
thrusting
blindly
towards
the
gates
that
i
first
realised
that
half
the
people
in
the
place
were
sneezing
to
glory
i
was
still
digesting
this
phenomenon
when
i
sneezed
myself
still
it
never
occurred
to
me
there
are
times
when
you
have
to
be
told
right
out
i
did
have
to
wait
long
as
i
presented
my
ticket
a
truck
full
of
luggage
was
pushed
through
the
gate
next
to
mine
the
porters
about
it
were
sneezing
bitterly
said
one
of
them
contemptuously
be
blarsted
pepper
whether
at
that
moment
my
stomach
in
fact
slipped
or
not
i
am
unable
to
say
but
the
impression
that
my
contents
had
dropped
several
inches
was
overwhelming
i
staggered
into
the
pullman
more
dead
than
alive
after
a
large
barley
and
a
small
water
i
felt
somewhat
revived
but
it
was
not
until
the
train
was
to
dover
that
i
had
myself
in
hand
i
was
just
beginning
under
the
auspices
of
a
second
milk
and
soda
to
consider
my
hideous
plight
when
a
genial
fool
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
asked
me
if
i
had
the
comedy
at
victoria
icily
i
inquired
comedy
he
explained
offensively
that
cuckoo
had
tried
the
old
wheeze
of
stuffing
pepper
in
his
trunk
to
put
off
the
customs
and
that
the
intended
deterrent
had
untimely
emerged
my
brothers
conceive
my
exhilaration
old
wheeze
i
could
have
broken
the
brute
neck
when
he
offered
me
a
cigar
with
a
kink
in
it
and
said
with
a
leer
that
i
should
many
like
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
chops
i
could
have
witnessed
his
mutilation
unmoved
still
it
an
ill
wind
the
swine
words
were
like
a
spur
i
became
determined
to
get
the
stuff
through
grimly
i
watched
the
case
go
on
to
the
boat
to
the
accompaniment
of
such
nasal
convulsions
as
i
had
never
believed
to
be
consistent
with
life
itself
by
way
of
diverting
suspicion
i
asked
one
of
the
crew
what
was
the
matter
his
blasphemous
answer
was
charged
with
such
malignity
that
i
found
it
necessary
to
stay
myself
with
yet
another
still
lemonade
arrived
at
calais
i
hurried
on
board
the
train
the
journey
to
paris
was
frightful
the
nearer
we
got
the
more
dishevelled
became
my
wits
the
power
of
concentration
deserted
me
finally
as
we
were
running
in
i
found
that
i
had
forgotten
the
french
for
i
looked
it
out
the
night
before
i
been
murmuring
it
all
day
long
and
now
at
the
critical
moment
it
had
deserted
me
i
clasped
my
head
in
my
hands
and
thought
like
a
madman
nothing
doing
i
thought
all
round
it
of
course
i
thought
of
candles
and
camphor
and
dusk
my
vocabulary
became
gigantic
but
it
did
not
include
the
french
equivalent
for
in
desperation
i
approached
my
and
in
broken
accents
implored
him
to
tell
me
french
for
the
little
creatures
which
you
find
in
your
i
like
the
french
if
i
asked
an
englishman
he
have
pulled
the
but
this
fellow
never
so
much
as
stared
he
just
released
a
little
spurt
of
and
then
started
in
as
if
his
future
happiness
depended
on
putting
me
straight
i
was
meaning
the
fleas
oh
indubitably
animals
most
gross
only
last
november
he
himself
it
took
quite
a
lot
of
persuasion
to
get
him
off
fleas
then
he
offered
me
lice
i
managed
to
make
him
understand
that
the
attack
was
delivered
when
the
clothes
were
unoccupied
instantly
he
suggested
rats
with
an
effort
i
explained
that
the
things
i
meant
were
winged
as
the
train
came
to
a
standstill
he
handed
me
bats
i
ask
you
i
stepped
on
to
the
platform
as
if
i
was
descending
into
my
tomb
how
i
got
to
the
i
hanged
if
i
know
but
i
remember
standing
there
shivering
and
wiping
the
sweat
off
my
face
truck
by
truck
the
registered
baggage
appeared
i
heard
my
case
coming
for
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
architecture
of
the
at
the
du
may
be
crude
but
its
acoustic
properties
are
superb
the
noise
which
accompanied
the
arrival
of
the
cortege
was
simply
i
was
in
the
very
act
of
wondering
whether
if
i
decided
to
retire
my
legs
would
carry
me
when
with
a
crash
my
was
slammed
on
to
the
counter
three
paces
away
a
cloud
of
pepper
arose
from
it
and
in
an
instant
all
was
confusion
passengers
and
porters
in
the
vicinity
dropped
everything
and
made
a
rush
for
the
doors
a
customs
official
who
was
plumbing
the
depths
of
a
turned
innocently
enough
to
see
the
case
smoking
at
his
elbow
dropped
his
cigar
into
some
blouses
let
out
the
screech
of
a
maniac
and
threw
himself
face
downward
upon
the
floor
somebody
cried
and
children
first
and
the
supreme
moment
having
arrived
i
i
had
the
i
stepped
to
the
case
and
with
most
horrible
oaths
flung
my
hat
upon
the
ground
smote
upon
the
counter
with
my
fist
and
started
to
rave
like
a
fanatic
i
made
the
most
awful
scene
i
roared
out
that
it
was
my
box
and
that
it
and
its
contents
were
irretrievably
ruined
gradually
curiosity
displaced
alarm
and
people
began
to
return
i
yelled
and
stamped
more
than
ever
i
denounced
the
french
railways
i
demanded
the
i
swore
i
have
damages
i
tore
off
the
cords
i
lifted
the
lid
i
alternately
sneezed
and
raged
and
finally
i
took
out
my
tunic
and
shook
it
savagely
in
vain
the
excisemen
insisted
that
it
was
not
their
business
i
cursed
them
bitterly
jerked
an
ounce
of
pepper
out
of
a
pair
of
brogues
and
replied
that
they
were
responsible
it
was
after
i
had
shaken
my
second
pair
of
slacks
that
the
officials
with
streaming
eyes
began
to
beseech
me
to
unpack
the
case
no
further
if
only
they
known
i
did
need
much
inducing
i
could
see
the
shape
of
a
under
one
of
my
shirts
of
course
i
argued
a
bit
for
the
look
of
the
thing
but
eventually
i
allowed
myself
to
be
persuaded
and
shoved
the
kit
back
finally
they
scrawled
all
over
the
lid
with
pieces
of
chalk
and
vowing
the
most
hideous
vengeance
and
invoking
the
british
ambassador
i
stalked
in
the
wake
of
my
box
out
of
the
station
i
was
through
i
had
my
dinner
in
bed
i
think
i
deserved
it
still
i
suppose
it
was
indiscreet
to
have
ordered
lobster
la
i
have
slept
better
i
sleeping
better
at
eight
the
next
morning
when
a
waiter
entered
to
say
that
was
an
official
to
see
me
from
the
gare
du
believing
it
to
be
another
dream
i
turned
over
and
shut
my
eyes
the
waiter
approached
and
touching
me
on
the
arm
repeated
his
ghastly
communication
with
a
frightful
effort
i
explained
that
i
had
the
ague
and
could
see
nobody
for
some
days
mercifully
he
retired
and
for
a
little
space
i
lay
in
a
sort
of
trance
after
a
bit
i
began
to
wonder
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
i
was
to
do
i
was
afraid
to
get
up
and
i
was
afraid
to
stay
in
bed
i
was
afraid
to
stop
in
the
hotel
and
i
was
terrified
of
meeting
the
official
downstairs
i
was
afraid
to
leave
the
case
there
and
i
was
still
more
afraid
to
take
it
away
i
was
getting
hungry
and
i
was
afraid
to
ring
for
breakfast
it
was
a
positively
poisonous
position
finally
after
a
lot
of
thought
i
got
up
bolted
the
door
unpacked
the
blasted
box
and
shoved
all
the
tobacco
in
the
drawers
of
the
wardrobe
luckily
there
was
a
key
the
kit
i
disposed
naturally
enough
then
i
had
a
bath
and
dressed
as
i
was
fastening
my
collar
the
telephone
went
it
was
the
du
i
jammed
the
receiver
back
as
i
passed
through
the
hall
a
clerk
dashed
after
me
du
he
said
insisting
upon
seeing
me
about
a
case
of
mine
i
replied
that
i
was
busy
all
day
and
could
see
nobody
before
six
i
did
mention
that
my
train
went
at
five
it
was
as
well
i
did
argue
for
as
i
left
the
hotel
a
station
official
entered
i
leapt
into
a
taxi
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
not
that
i
felt
like
church
but
it
was
the
first
place
i
could
think
of
somebody
shouted
after
me
but
well
you
know
how
they
drive
in
paris
i
stopped
round
the
second
corner
discharged
the
taxi
and
walked
to
a
restaurant
by
rights
i
should
have
been
ravenous
as
it
was
the
food
stuck
in
my
throat
a
bottle
of
however
pulled
me
together
after
luncheon
i
went
to
a
cinema
i
had
to
do
something
besides
the
darkness
attracted
me
i
fancy
i
dozed
for
a
bit
any
way
the
first
thing
i
remember
was
a
couple
of
men
being
arrested
in
the
lounge
of
a
hotel
it
was
most
realistic
what
was
more
the
clerk
who
had
run
after
me
in
the
morning
and
the
clerk
on
the
screen
might
have
been
twins
i
imagine
that
my
hair
rose
upon
my
head
and
for
the
second
time
it
seemed
certain
that
i
had
mislaid
my
paunch
i
got
out
of
the
place
somehow
to
find
that
it
was
snowing
for
the
next
hour
i
drove
up
and
down
the
i
only
hope
the
driver
enjoyed
it
more
than
i
did
at
last
when
pneumonia
seemed
very
near
i
told
him
to
drive
to
the
hotel
i
fairly
whipped
through
the
hall
and
into
the
lift
as
this
ascended
a
page
arrived
at
the
gate
and
spoke
upward
i
did
hear
what
he
said
when
i
was
in
a
hot
bath
the
telephone
went
i
let
the
swine
ring
finally
somebody
came
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
my
wisdom
i
bolted
it
so
after
waiting
a
little
they
entered
i
lay
in
the
bath
like
the
dead
after
a
good
look
round
they
went
away
by
twenty
past
four
i
dressed
and
repacked
the
case
i
rang
for
a
porter
told
him
to
shove
it
on
a
taxi
and
descended
to
settle
my
bill
mercifully
the
clerk
who
had
stopped
me
in
the
morning
was
off
duty
i
could
have
squealed
with
delight
i
paid
my
reckoning
tipped
about
eight
people
i
never
seen
before
and
climbed
into
the
cab
ten
minutes
later
i
was
at
the
by
the
time
i
was
in
the
wagon
lit
it
was
ten
minutes
to
five
i
sank
down
upon
the
seat
in
silent
gratitude
the
comfortable
glow
of
salvation
began
to
steal
over
my
limbs
i
looked
benevolently
about
me
i
reflected
that
after
all
the
last
thirty
hours
of
my
life
had
been
rich
with
valuable
experience
smilingly
i
decided
not
to
regret
them
when
i
thought
of
the
scene
in
the
i
actually
laughed
then
the
conductor
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
and
said
that
there
was
somebody
to
see
me
from
the
du
berry
suspended
his
recital
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
i
shall
never
be
the
same
again
he
said
brokenly
never
again
up
to
then
i
had
a
chance
a
sporting
chance
of
recovery
at
that
moment
it
snapped
in
a
blinding
flash
i
saw
what
a
fool
i
been
if
only
stayed
on
the
platform
if
i
only
gone
into
the
restaurant
car
if
i
only
locked
myself
in
a
lavatory
till
the
train
had
started
i
should
have
been
all
right
as
it
was
i
was
caught
bending
it
was
the
official
i
seen
in
the
morning
all
right
after
a
preliminary
flurry
of
ejaculation
he
locked
the
door
behind
him
and
began
to
talk
do
ask
me
what
he
said
because
i
did
hear
when
the
rope
round
your
neck
you
apt
to
miss
the
subtleties
of
the
hangman
charge
after
a
time
i
realised
that
he
was
asking
me
a
question
i
stared
at
him
dully
and
shook
my
head
with
a
gesture
of
despair
he
glanced
at
his
watch
he
said
train
departs
i
have
sought
you
all
day
the
superintendent
has
told
me
to
speak
with
you
at
all
costs
to
beg
that
you
will
lodge
no
complaint
he
is
desolated
that
your
baggage
was
injured
it
is
a
misfortune
frightful
he
can
not
think
how
it
has
occurred
but
to
complain
no
i
will
tell
the
truth
twice
in
the
last
an
english
officer
baggage
has
gone
astray
but
one
more
complaint
from
your
embassy
and
the
superintendent
will
be
replaced
and
in
ten
short
days
he
will
have
won
his
pension
ah
be
merciful
i
was
merciful
i
waved
the
fellow
away
and
swore
haltingly
that
i
would
say
nothing
we
mingled
a
few
tears
and
he
got
out
as
the
train
was
moving
and
there
you
are
i
got
my
reprieve
everything
in
the
garden
was
lovely
but
i
could
enjoy
it
my
spirits
failed
to
respond
he
took
the
sealyham
head
between
his
hands
and
gazed
into
his
eyes
o
nobwell
had
i
but
seen
the
fool
at
eight
as
he
desired
he
would
not
in
the
train
have
put
the
wind
up
me
so
hellishly
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
jonah
stepped
to
my
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
brother
he
said
i
take
my
hat
off
i
tell
you
frankly
i
have
done
it
i
would
have
claimed
that
case
at
paris
for
a
thousand
pounds
clamorously
we
endorsed
his
approval
by
way
of
acknowledgment
the
hero
groaned
what
you
want
said
i
is
a
good
night
rest
by
you
be
touching
the
ground
in
spots
i
sha
be
touching
it
at
all
said
berry
if
it
nice
and
warm
i
shall
have
a
bath
chair
which
you
and
jonah
will
propel
at
a
convenient
pace
nobby
will
sit
at
my
feet
as
a
hostage
against
your
careless
negotiation
of
gradients
he
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
and
pitched
it
on
to
a
table
i
fancy
he
added
i
heard
them
put
the
case
on
the
landing
and
as
i
propose
decorative
though
it
is
to
remove
my
beard
perhaps
one
of
you
wasters
will
fetch
me
a
cigarette
there
was
a
rush
for
the
door
true
enough
the
was
outside
jonah
and
i
had
its
cords
off
in
twenty
seconds
one
hinge
was
broken
and
some
khaki
was
protruding
adèle
thrust
the
key
into
the
lock
this
was
too
stiff
for
her
fingers
so
after
a
desperate
struggle
she
let
me
have
at
the
wards
after
an
exhausting
two
minutes
we
sent
for
a
as
the
lock
yielded
berry
appeared
upon
the
scene
for
a
moment
he
stared
at
us
then
but
why
not
he
inquired
that
the
stuff
to
open
a
broken
box
with
if
you
do
like
the
look
of
the
key
you
know
you
thwarting
me
and
do
try
to
turn
the
lid
back
because
there
are
any
hin
the
sentence
was
never
finished
as
i
lifted
the
lid
my
fell
upon
his
knees
with
trembling
hands
he
plucked
at
a
jaeger
rug
reposing
carefully
folded
upon
the
top
of
some
underclothes
then
he
threw
back
his
head
and
took
himself
by
the
throat
goats
and
monkeys
he
shrieked
somebody
else
case
when
hours
later
a
letter
arrived
from
piers
aunt
inviting
us
all
to
tea
we
accepted
not
because
we
felt
inclined
to
go
junketing
but
because
we
did
not
wish
to
seem
rude
we
were
in
a
peevish
mood
for
this
the
loss
of
our
forbidden
fruit
was
indirectly
responsible
the
immediate
cause
of
our
was
the
exasperating
reflection
that
we
were
debarred
from
taking
even
those
simple
steps
which
lead
to
the
restoration
of
lost
luggage
we
stood
in
the
shoes
of
a
burglar
who
has
been
robbed
of
his
spoils
as
like
as
not
our
precious
was
lying
at
the
station
waiting
to
be
claimed
yet
we
dared
not
inquire
because
of
what
our
inquiries
might
bring
forth
of
course
the
authorities
might
be
totally
ignorant
of
its
contents
but
then
again
they
might
not
it
was
a
risk
we
could
not
take
the
chance
that
by
identifying
our
property
we
might
be
at
once
accusing
and
convicting
ourselves
of
smuggling
a
very
large
quantity
of
tobacco
was
too
considerable
there
were
moments
when
jonah
and
i
goaded
to
desperation
felt
ready
to
risk
penal
servitude
and
a
dart
at
the
bait
but
berry
would
not
permit
us
if
things
went
wrong
he
declared
he
was
bound
to
be
involved
hideously
and
he
had
enough
of
thin
ice
the
wonder
was
his
hair
was
white
by
the
time
we
had
swung
him
round
our
own
courage
had
evaporated
as
for
piers
no
one
of
us
had
seen
or
heard
from
him
for
five
whole
days
ever
since
his
extraordinary
outburst
upon
the
verandah
the
boy
had
made
himself
scarce
while
we
were
all
perplexed
jill
took
his
absence
to
heart
she
mourned
openly
she
missed
her
playfellow
bitterly
and
said
as
much
and
when
three
days
had
gone
by
and
the
last
post
had
brought
no
word
of
him
she
burst
into
tears
the
next
morning
there
were
rings
beneath
her
great
grey
eyes
she
was
far
too
artless
to
pretend
that
she
did
not
care
such
a
course
of
action
never
occurred
to
her
she
had
no
idea
of
course
that
she
was
in
love
all
the
same
when
upon
wednesday
afternoon
the
cars
were
waiting
to
take
us
to
tea
with
waterbrook
my
cousin
leaned
over
the
banisters
with
a
bright
red
spot
upon
either
cheek
i
say
she
cried
i
not
coming
one
and
all
we
stared
up
amazedly
not
coming
cried
daphne
but
darling
jill
stamped
her
small
foot
she
said
shakily
i
not
and
and
if
he
asks
after
me
say
i
awfully
well
but
i
felt
i
wanted
a
walk
i
going
to
take
nobby
out
her
skirts
whirled
and
she
was
gone
adèle
flew
after
her
while
the
rest
of
us
stood
whispering
in
the
hall
five
minutes
later
the
two
descended
together
but
while
we
others
climbed
into
the
cars
jill
twitched
a
lead
from
the
rack
and
took
her
stand
upon
the
steps
with
nobby
leaping
for
joy
about
her
sides
and
when
she
cried
there
was
a
ring
in
her
tone
which
sounded
too
glad
to
be
true
waterbrook
was
perfectly
charming
as
we
were
ushered
into
a
really
beautiful
salon
she
rose
from
a
little
bureau
a
tall
graceful
figure
with
masses
of
pretty
grey
hair
and
warm
brown
eyes
my
dear
she
said
to
daphne
what
a
beautiful
creature
you
are
she
turned
to
adèle
as
for
you
if
i
were
your
husband
i
afraid
i
should
have
a
swelled
head
which
is
he
ah
i
see
by
the
light
in
his
eyes
of
course
i
ought
to
have
called
upon
you
but
i
lazy
by
nature
and
my
car
wo
be
here
till
and
now
i
must
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
to
piers
he
ought
to
be
here
of
course
but
where
he
is
i
do
know
i
hardly
seen
him
since
i
arrived
he
seems
to
be
crazy
about
his
uncomfortable
car
went
to
bordeaux
and
back
yesterday
three
hundred
miles
if
you
please
i
feel
weak
when
i
think
of
it
and
now
please
tell
me
about
yourselves
beyond
that
you
all
delightful
i
heard
nothing
from
him
i
would
not
have
believed
that
one
woman
could
entertain
five
strangers
with
such
outstanding
success
within
five
minutes
jonah
and
daphne
were
by
her
side
upon
the
sofa
adèle
was
upon
the
hearth
at
their
feet
berry
was
leaning
against
the
mantelpiece
and
i
was
sitting
upon
the
arm
of
an
adjacent
chair
describing
our
meeting
with
piers
a
fortnight
ago
i
do
know
his
age
i
concluded
i
take
it
he
about
nineteen
but
he
got
the
airs
and
graces
of
peter
pan
piers
said
waterbrook
is
his
mother
was
my
sister
she
married
his
father
when
she
was
seventeen
he
was
twenty
years
older
than
she
but
they
were
awfully
happy
the
blood
pure
english
although
the
title
italian
the
fief
of
the
duchy
goes
with
it
they
were
given
to
piers
he
was
a
diplomat
for
services
rendered
a
recent
attempt
to
dispossess
the
boy
mercifully
failed
she
looked
round
about
her
by
the
way
i
thought
there
were
six
of
you
piers
gave
me
the
number
but
neither
gender
nor
anything
else
there
a
female
to
come
said
berry
but
i
do
think
she
will
she
a
wayward
child
we
send
her
round
to
apologise
here
coffee
and
chocolate
were
served
i
must
apologise
said
waterbrook
for
giving
you
no
tea
but
there
you
are
she
sighed
what
tea
you
can
get
in
france
reminds
me
of
grocer
port
i
wo
touch
it
myself
and
i
have
the
face
to
offer
it
to
my
guests
i
usually
bring
some
from
england
but
i
i
did
this
time
she
passed
a
hand
across
her
eyes
as
though
to
brush
away
a
memory
after
all
you
need
come
again
need
you
but
we
do
the
same
said
daphne
we
given
up
tea
up
to
last
week
i
clung
to
a
cup
before
breakfast
but
now
i
stopped
it
yes
said
berry
it
was
affecting
her
brain
ten
minutes
after
she
swallowed
it
she
used
to
begin
to
wonder
why
she
married
me
i
believe
you
said
waterbrook
you
ca
drink
french
tea
and
be
resigned
now
a
cup
of
chocolate
affords
relief
before
berry
could
reply
she
had
pointed
to
an
old
china
box
and
said
that
it
contained
cigarettes
if
she
had
said
that
it
was
full
of
black
pearls
she
could
not
have
created
more
excitement
besides
there
was
a
confidence
in
her
tone
that
set
my
nerves
tingling
it
was
i
felt
sure
no
grocer
port
that
she
was
commending
and
i
we
with
the
exception
of
berry
had
not
smoked
a
good
cigarette
for
nearly
six
weeks
as
jonah
handed
the
box
to
daphne
i
strove
to
look
unconcerned
and
if
anybody
likes
cigars
added
waterbrook
there
are
some
in
that
silver
box
by
major
pleydell
berry
started
said
oh
er
thanks
very
much
and
opened
the
box
then
he
took
out
a
cigar
idly
enough
i
became
conscious
that
daphne
and
adèle
eyes
were
upon
me
as
jonah
brought
me
the
cigarettes
i
took
one
without
looking
and
stared
back
instantly
their
eyes
shifted
to
the
cigarette
in
my
hand
i
followed
their
gaze
to
behold
one
of
the
brand
which
i
had
smoked
invariably
for
seven
years
dazedly
i
looked
across
at
berry
to
see
him
regarding
his
cigar
with
bulging
eyes
as
in
a
dream
i
heard
jonah
voice
you
must
forgive
my
cousins
they
not
being
rude
to
tell
you
the
truth
we
recently
had
a
bereavement
a
particularly
cherished
friend
who
was
to
furnish
us
all
with
tobacco
for
several
months
disappeared
in
sickening
circumstances
only
two
days
ago
the
cigar
and
the
cigarette
have
revived
some
painful
memories
our
hostess
opened
and
closed
her
mouth
before
replying
then
what
she
said
faintly
what
was
your
er
cherished
friend
like
berry
started
to
his
feet
both
hinges
gone
he
shouted
tied
up
with
rope
reeking
of
pepper
waterbrook
interrupted
him
with
a
shriek
he
outside
my
bedroom
she
wailed
by
the
side
of
the
i
suppose
it
too
much
to
hope
that
you
got
my
tea
tea
we
screamed
tea
piped
our
hostess
beautiful
china
tea
pounds
of
it
under
the
camisoles
berry
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
modesty
forbade
us
he
said
to
go
further
than
the
it
was
in
the
midst
of
our
rejoicing
that
piers
set
foot
on
the
verandah
for
a
moment
he
stood
staring
pardonably
bewildered
at
the
two
smugglers
who
were
saluting
one
another
respectively
with
a
profound
curtsey
and
the
most
elaborate
of
bows
then
he
pulled
open
the
great
window
and
stepped
hesitatingly
into
the
room
as
he
did
so
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
appeared
mees
mansel
he
announced
nobby
entered
anyhow
pleasedly
lugging
jill
into
the
room
why
jill
cried
daphne
my
dear
waterbrook
let
me
introduce
that
not
miss
mansel
it
was
piers
voice
with
one
accord
we
turned
staring
with
arm
outstretched
the
boy
was
pointing
at
jill
for
a
moment
nobody
moved
then
piers
sprang
forward
and
caught
jill
hands
in
his
jill
he
panted
jill
you
not
miss
mansel
yes
i
am
said
jill
steadily
but
i
thought
you
were
married
to
boy
i
thought
i
thought
adèle
was
miss
mansel
oh
piers
said
jill
reproachfully
and
she
got
a
on
piers
stared
at
jill
hand
i
i
never
thought
of
that
he
said
slowly
i
am
silly
a
wonderful
smile
came
tearing
to
light
his
face
but
oh
jill
he
faltered
i
am
so
awfully
glad
never
i
fancy
was
love
so
simply
declared
for
a
moment
jill
looked
at
him
then
her
eyes
fell
and
an
exquisite
blush
came
stealing
into
her
cheeks
for
an
instant
piers
hesitated
then
he
let
fall
her
fingers
and
turned
about
flushing
furiously
before
he
had
found
his
tongue
my
cousin
advanced
to
her
hostess
and
put
out
her
hand
i
afraid
i
awfully
late
she
said
quietly
waterbrook
stooped
and
kissed
her
my
darling
she
said
softly
it
was
worth
waiting
for
chapter
vii
how
daphne
lost
her
bedfellow
and
the
line
of
least
resistance
proved
irresistible
order
so
to
speak
having
been
restored
and
the
path
of
love
made
straight
beyond
all
manner
of
doubt
we
decided
festively
to
make
an
excursion
to
spain
the
fact
that
piers
could
speak
spanish
suggested
that
all
the
arrangements
should
be
left
in
his
hands
we
embraced
the
suggestion
cordially
then
at
the
eleventh
hour
a
courteously
imperative
wire
from
his
solicitors
had
deprived
us
of
our
courier
the
duke
of
padua
had
left
pau
that
evening
and
all
six
of
us
had
gone
to
the
station
to
speed
him
to
paris
and
rome
my
cousin
farewell
to
her
future
husband
had
been
ridiculously
affecting
polonius
advice
to
his
son
was
above
rubies
but
jill
charge
came
pelting
out
of
an
eager
heart
oh
and
piers
darling
you
will
take
care
wo
you
and
do
wear
warm
things
i
sure
it
still
most
awfully
cold
up
there
and
and
i
do
know
what
men
wear
extra
but
could
you
put
on
a
bodybelt
binder
dear
binder
corrected
berry
well
binder
then
i
remember
jonah
saying
never
said
her
brother
yes
you
did
you
said
the
great
thing
was
to
keep
warm
round
the
er
round
the
hips
berry
looked
round
all
women
and
children
he
said
will
leave
the
court
piers
you
will
wo
you
for
my
sake
oh
and
do
forget
got
to
get
some
because
your
left
one
comes
down
and
be
very
careful
crossing
the
streets
wait
till
there
a
gap
always
and
do
drink
the
water
will
you
do
even
use
it
for
your
teeth
daphne
wo
that
right
said
berry
do
as
she
does
combine
business
with
pleasure
and
clean
them
in
a
small
worthington
oh
and
lock
your
door
at
night
just
in
case
and
piers
darling
i
love
you
very
much
and
and
god
bless
you
dear
and
i
shall
just
wait
and
wait
for
you
to
come
back
again
hat
in
hand
piers
put
her
fingers
to
his
lips
madonna
they
kissed
one
another
passionately
the
next
moment
the
train
was
moving
and
the
duke
swung
himself
on
to
the
step
of
the
jill
began
to
trot
by
his
side
when
she
could
run
no
faster
my
cousin
gave
up
the
attempt
and
stood
waving
her
tiny
handkerchief
and
then
staring
after
the
train
as
we
came
up
she
turned
to
us
bravely
i
hope
she
said
shakily
i
hope
he
get
on
all
right
he
such
a
child
she
added
knitting
her
pretty
brow
i
wish
to
goodness
we
were
married
then
i
could
have
gone
with
him
she
stumbled
and
i
caught
her
she
looked
up
at
me
with
her
grey
eyes
swimming
often
seen
you
off
boy
but
i
was
silly
like
this
it
a
question
of
interest
darling
piers
is
your
very
own
pigeon
jill
wiped
her
eyes
thoughtfully
i
suppose
that
it
she
said
slowly
my
very
own
boy
will
you
take
me
to
a
tailor
i
want
to
get
a
binder
ere
we
sat
down
to
dinner
that
night
two
stout
had
been
dispatched
to
paris
by
registered
post
satisfactorily
said
berry
restoring
his
napkin
to
his
knees
to
consume
oxtail
one
should
be
stripped
to
the
waist
that
do
said
daphne
as
a
rule
said
her
husband
it
will
of
course
for
a
really
careless
feeder
still
further
divestment
may
be
desirable
afterwards
he
can
be
hosed
and
now
about
spain
of
course
without
piers
to
talk
for
us
we
shall
be
mocked
misled
and
generally
stung
to
glory
but
there
you
are
if
you
landed
with
half
a
kingdom
i
guess
up
to
you
to
take
possession
as
at
present
arranged
said
jonah
we
start
the
day
after
spend
one
night
at
pampeluna
two
at
san
sebastian
and
get
back
on
saturday
one
clear
day
murmured
daphne
i
suppose
that
give
us
time
what
there
to
do
said
adèle
besides
packing
not
much
said
jonah
the
passports
have
been
and
the
main
thing
we
must
get
some
money
at
the
bank
spanish
money
i
mean
book
rooms
run
over
the
cars
i
ca
think
of
anything
else
we
better
take
some
insecticide
said
berry
spain
very
conservative
nonsense
said
daphne
all
right
said
her
husband
only
on
the
command
wake
me
to
inspect
the
bodyguard
have
we
any
castanets
and
what
about
some
sombreros
i
mean
i
want
to
do
the
thing
properly
thanks
said
his
wife
but
if
you
going
in
fancy
dress
rather
remain
at
pau
i
have
forgotten
our
second
sunday
here
i
shall
always
maintain
was
the
reply
that
i
was
suitably
dressed
on
the
previous
sunday
i
had
carefully
studied
the
fashions
upon
the
boulevard
and
i
flatter
myself
that
had
i
been
permitted
to
appear
in
public
my
attire
would
have
found
immediate
favour
if
said
i
i
remember
aright
it
consisted
of
a
white
bowler
a
blue
silk
stockings
and
boots
that
right
said
berry
and
an
alpenstock
i
ought
really
to
have
had
my
cuffs
trimmed
with
skunk
he
added
wistfully
but
i
thought
of
it
too
late
i
tell
you
what
said
adèle
we
must
take
some
films
that
right
said
jill
i
promised
piers
we
send
him
some
snapshots
jonah
groaned
surely
he
said
our
passport
photographs
are
bad
enough
the
camera
said
berry
can
never
lie
besides
i
very
fond
of
your
passport
portrait
i
admit
i
had
previously
noticed
that
your
right
ear
was
so
much
the
larger
of
the
two
but
the
cast
in
your
left
eye
is
very
beautifully
insisted
upon
mine
i
must
confess
is
less
successful
had
i
been
told
that
it
was
a
study
of
the
honorary
treasurer
of
the
splodgeworth
goose
club
on
bail
i
should
have
held
it
an
excellent
likeness
daphne
is
very
good
she
wearing
that
particularly
sweet
expression
of
hers
you
can
almost
hear
her
saying
a
large
port
apart
they
bad
enough
but
with
both
of
them
on
the
same
document
well
why
we
were
turned
back
at
boulogne
i
shall
never
know
boy
again
is
lifelike
shame
said
adèle
he
looks
all
bloated
i
know
he
does
sweetheart
but
that
his
own
fault
what
put
in
the
mouth
comes
out
in
the
flesh
the
camera
can
never
lie
and
now
do
choke
it
unmaidenly
and
i
can
not
think
of
you
as
a
matron
let
see
oh
yes
films
anything
else
soap
said
daphne
said
jill
cards
said
adèle
tea
said
daphne
said
i
plate
and
linen
said
berry
that
nine
let
go
by
train
anybody
said
jonah
would
think
that
we
were
going
into
the
bush
if
you
must
have
a
camera
well
take
one
but
as
for
soap
and
tea
and
and
oh
you
make
me
tired
and
me
said
berry
unctuously
a
plain
man
of
few
words
all
this
vulgar
about
creature
comforts
it
was
hardly
to
be
expected
that
he
would
get
any
further
it
was
when
the
storm
of
indignation
was
at
its
height
that
the
electric
light
failed
four
of
us
breathed
the
same
expletive
simultaneously
then
lost
said
berry
voice
two
and
a
blob
of
french
mustard
finder
will
be
the
crash
of
glass
interrupted
him
do
move
falcon
or
you
wreck
the
room
besides
it
soon
be
dawn
the
nights
are
getting
shorter
every
day
very
good
sir
replied
the
butler
they
bring
some
candles
in
a
minute
said
daphne
what
we
really
want
said
my
is
a
prismatic
compass
what
for
said
jill
to
take
a
bearing
with
then
we
should
know
where
the
port
was
and
i
could
peel
you
a
banana
or
would
you
rather
suck
it
brute
said
jill
shuddering
oh
why
is
the
dark
so
horrid
the
situation
said
i
calls
for
philosophy
true
said
berry
now
similarly
placed
what
would
epicurus
have
done
i
think
said
adèle
he
have
continued
his
discourse
as
if
nothing
had
happened
good
girl
said
jonah
any
more
queries
about
pampeluna
yes
said
my
sister
how
exactly
do
we
go
we
go
said
i
to
there
we
get
a
permit
to
take
the
cars
into
spain
then
we
go
over
the
mountains
by
roncevaux
it
a
wonderful
drive
they
say
but
the
very
deuce
of
a
climb
pampeluna
about
fifty
kilometres
from
the
top
of
the
pass
if
we
get
off
well
we
ought
to
be
there
in
time
for
tea
easily
said
jonah
it
only
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
and
resumed
a
surreptitious
search
for
the
chocolates
i
expect
we
shall
strike
some
snow
i
said
snow
cried
jill
rather
said
berry
and
avalanches
the
cars
will
be
roped
together
then
if
one
falls
it
take
the
other
with
it
will
somebody
pass
me
the
i
found
a
walnut
why
on
earth
said
daphne
do
they
bring
some
candles
falcon
yes
madam
try
to
find
the
door
and
go
and
see
what
they
doing
very
good
madam
with
infinite
care
the
butler
emerged
from
the
room
as
the
door
closed
and
now
said
adèle
i
ca
bear
it
any
longer
where
the
chocolates
my
dear
said
my
sister
i
been
feeling
for
the
wretched
things
ever
since
the
light
went
out
has
anybody
got
a
match
nobody
had
a
match
at
length
they
ca
have
been
put
on
the
table
said
jill
i
here
they
are
said
berry
where
here
give
me
your
pretty
white
hand
this
is
them
said
jill
they
in
oh
you
brute
done
it
on
purpose
i
awfully
sorry
said
berry
i
quite
thought
you
liar
said
jill
heatedly
you
did
it
on
purpose
you
know
you
did
daphne
he
gone
and
put
my
hand
in
the
ginger
it
wear
off
dear
said
berry
it
wear
off
by
the
time
piers
is
back
you
hardly
know
the
apologetic
entry
of
falcon
with
two
inches
of
candle
upon
a
plate
cut
short
the
prophecy
as
he
solemnly
set
the
brand
in
the
centre
of
the
table
the
light
returned
with
a
flash
it
was
when
the
butler
had
placed
the
wine
before
berry
and
was
about
to
withdraw
that
daphne
asked
for
the
chocolates
falcon
peered
at
the
table
they
were
there
madam
he
said
berry
looked
round
uneasily
i
think
perhaps
he
began
stooping
to
feel
under
his
chair
i
think
i
mean
fearing
lest
in
the
confusion
he
broke
off
to
stare
at
a
small
silver
bowl
which
was
as
bare
as
his
hand
daphne
took
a
deep
breath
and
that
was
full
she
said
witheringly
and
you
sat
there
and
let
us
feel
all
over
the
table
and
pretended
you
were
looking
and
put
jill
hand
in
the
ginger
and
all
the
time
i
never
ate
one
said
berry
i
never
he
stopped
short
and
looked
round
the
room
nobby
the
sealyham
emerged
from
beneath
the
table
expectant
sternly
my
held
out
the
bowl
never
was
guilt
more
plainly
betrayed
the
pricked
ears
fell
flat
the
bright
brown
eyes
sank
to
the
floor
the
pert
white
tail
was
lowered
incontinently
nobby
had
hauled
down
his
flag
oh
nobby
the
terrier
squirmed
laid
his
head
upon
the
ground
and
then
rolled
over
upon
his
back
you
ca
blame
the
dog
said
i
besides
he
pay
for
it
quarter
of
a
pound
of
chocolates
fairly
i
just
remembered
said
daphne
that
they
were
chocolates
at
all
they
were
the
last
of
the
bunch
they
make
any
more
this
year
berry
wiped
his
forehead
are
you
saying
this
he
demanded
to
torment
me
or
is
it
true
it
a
fact
but
what
about
tea
screamed
her
husband
tea
without
a
will
be
like
like
hell
without
the
prince
of
darkness
i
ca
help
it
france
has
a
close
season
for
them
berry
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
under
my
chair
he
wailed
the
last
of
the
bunch
sic
and
i
never
ate
one
come
come
said
i
similarly
placed
what
would
epicurus
have
done
i
know
said
adèle
what
said
berry
my
wife
smiled
he
made
tracks
for
spain
she
said
the
french
sergeant
saluted
daphne
nodded
berry
said
down
with
everything
i
touched
my
hat
and
we
rolled
slowly
over
the
little
bridge
out
of
one
country
into
another
our
reception
was
very
serious
so
far
as
our
papers
were
concerned
the
spanish
knew
his
job
and
did
it
with
a
soldierly
if
somewhat
trying
precision
pong
was
diligently
compared
with
the
tale
of
his
our
faces
were
respectively
compared
with
the
unflattering
vignettes
pasted
upon
our
passports
the
visas
were
deliberately
inspected
our
certificates
were
unfolded
and
scrutinised
our
travelling
pass
was
digested
to
our
great
relief
however
he
let
the
luggage
go
we
had
no
contraband
but
we
were
two
hours
late
and
to
displace
and
replace
securely
a
trunk
and
a
upon
the
back
of
a
coupé
takes
several
minutes
and
necessitates
considerable
exertion
of
a
very
unpleasant
kind
finally
having
purchased
a
local
permit
for
five
pesetas
we
were
suffered
to
proceed
we
were
now
at
the
mouth
of
a
gorge
and
the
pass
was
before
us
had
the
gorge
been
a
rift
in
the
range
a
road
had
been
cut
by
the
side
of
the
torrent
and
our
way
if
tortuous
had
been
as
flat
as
your
hand
but
the
gorge
was
a
de
a
beautiful
blind
alley
with
mountains
flanks
for
walls
so
the
road
had
been
made
to
scale
one
side
of
the
alley
to
make
its
winding
way
as
best
it
could
turning
and
twisting
and
doubling
upon
itself
up
to
a
windy
saddle
which
we
could
hardly
see
i
gave
the
car
its
head
and
we
went
at
a
wicked
hill
as
a
bull
at
a
gate
almost
immediately
the
scenery
became
superb
with
every
yard
the
walls
of
the
gorge
were
drawing
further
apart
slowly
revealing
themselves
in
all
their
glory
forests
and
waterfalls
precipices
and
greenswards
grey
lichened
crags
and
terraces
up
above
all
an
exquisite
vesture
of
snow
flawless
and
dazzling
these
stood
for
beauty
all
the
wonder
of
height
the
towering
proportions
of
the
place
the
bewildering
pitch
of
the
sky
these
stood
for
grandeur
an
infinite
serenity
an
imperturbable
peace
a
silence
which
the
faint
gush
of
springs
served
to
enrich
these
stood
for
majesty
nature
has
about
the
world
and
this
was
one
of
them
i
started
the
engine
again
for
we
had
instinctively
stopped
and
pong
thrust
on
up
up
up
we
toiled
through
the
hanging
village
of
valcarlos
past
a
long
string
of
jingling
mules
under
stupendous
porches
of
the
living
rock
round
bends
by
woods
and
coppices
over
grey
bridges
wet
and
shining
and
all
stuck
with
ferns
now
looking
forward
to
the
ridge
now
facing
back
to
find
the
frontier
village
shrunk
to
a
white
huddle
of
dots
the
torrent
to
a
winking
thread
of
silver
and
our
late
road
to
a
slender
straggling
ribbon
absurdly
foreign
ridiculously
remote
on
we
stormed
higher
and
higher
past
boulders
and
poor
trees
wrung
with
the
wind
and
presently
up
and
into
and
over
the
snow
while
slowly
foot
by
foot
depth
dragged
height
down
to
nothing
for
the
third
time
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
engine
was
unwarrantably
hot
and
after
a
moment
consideration
i
took
out
the
clutch
and
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
what
is
it
said
daphne
she
hot
said
i
hotter
than
she
should
be
at
least
i
think
so
of
course
it
a
deuce
of
a
pull
and
with
that
i
opened
the
door
you
not
going
to
get
out
in
this
snow
only
a
second
dear
upon
observing
that
the
was
broken
it
was
natural
that
i
should
regret
very
much
that
i
had
not
looked
for
the
trouble
when
first
i
suspected
its
presence
had
i
done
so
i
should
have
spared
the
engine
i
should
have
been
able
to
correct
the
disorder
without
burning
myself
to
hell
and
i
should
not
have
been
standing
while
i
worked
in
four
inches
of
snow
gloomily
i
made
my
report
i
sorry
i
concluded
but
i
shall
have
to
have
berry
i
got
a
new
strap
in
the
boot
but
i
ca
shift
the
luggage
alone
berry
closed
his
eyes
and
sank
his
chin
upon
his
breast
go
on
old
chap
said
daphne
i
very
sorry
for
you
but
i
i
do
feel
well
said
berry
besides
i
have
got
my
will
you
get
out
said
his
wife
at
last
between
us
we
got
him
as
far
as
the
running
board
come
on
i
said
impatiently
do
rush
me
said
berry
staring
at
the
snow
as
if
it
were
molten
lead
do
rush
me
how
fresh
and
beautiful
it
looks
does
not
it
he
took
a
deep
breath
and
let
himself
down
upon
his
toes
if
you
can
do
sixty
kilometres
with
a
pound
of
snow
in
each
shoe
how
many
miles
is
that
to
the
gallon
the
belt
was
at
the
very
back
of
beyond
but
i
found
it
at
last
as
we
replaced
the
luggage
and
while
i
said
i
fixing
the
strap
you
might
fill
up
the
radiator
what
with
said
berry
snow
of
course
just
pick
it
up
and
shove
it
in
pick
it
up
and
sho
oh
give
me
strength
said
berry
brokenly
then
he
raised
his
voice
daphne
what
the
matter
i
got
to
pick
up
some
snow
now
well
rub
your
hands
with
it
dear
well
then
they
wo
get
you
er
you
do
mind
my
picking
it
up
then
i
mean
my
left
foot
is
already
gangrenous
well
rub
that
too
called
daphne
thanks
said
berry
grimly
i
think
i
rather
wait
for
the
dogs
i
expect
there
are
some
at
roncevaux
in
the
pictures
they
used
to
have
a
barrel
of
whisky
round
their
necks
the
great
thing
was
to
be
found
by
about
five
dogs
then
you
got
five
barrels
by
the
time
the
monks
arrived
you
were
quite
sorry
to
see
them
will
you
go
and
fill
up
the
radiator
said
i
unlocking
the
the
fitting
of
the
new
belt
was
a
blasphemous
business
my
fingers
were
cold
and
clumsy
and
everything
i
touched
was
however
at
last
it
was
done
as
i
was
looking
over
the
engine
we
better
pull
up
a
bit
said
berry
i
used
all
the
snow
round
here
just
a
few
feet
you
know
that
drift
over
there
last
me
a
long
time
what
mean
said
i
is
it
full
yet
well
i
thought
it
was
just
now
but
it
seems
to
go
down
i
put
in
about
a
hundredweight
to
date
an
investigation
of
the
phenomenon
revealed
the
unpleasant
truth
that
the
radiator
was
leaking
i
explained
this
to
berry
i
see
he
said
gravely
i
understand
in
other
words
for
the
last
twenty
minutes
i
have
been
at
some
pains
to
be
introducing
water
into
an
inconveniently
shaped
sieve
that
said
i
is
the
idea
and
for
all
the
good
i
been
doing
i
might
have
been
trying
to
eat
a
lamb
cutlet
through
a
couple
of
straws
oh
no
you
cooled
her
down
in
fact
it
took
five
minutes
and
all
the
cajolery
at
my
command
to
induce
my
to
continue
his
danaidean
task
until
i
had
started
the
engine
and
we
were
ready
to
move
then
he
whipped
its
cap
on
to
the
radiator
and
clambered
into
the
car
i
was
extremely
uneasy
and
said
as
much
it
was
now
a
quarter
to
five
pampeluna
was
some
thirty
miles
away
and
heaven
only
knew
what
sort
of
country
lay
before
us
we
were
nearly
at
the
top
of
the
pass
and
presumably
once
we
were
over
we
should
strike
a
lot
of
down
hill
but
if
the
leak
became
worse
and
there
was
much
more
collarwork
desperately
i
put
pong
along
the
snow
was
deeper
now
and
was
affecting
the
steering
the
wheels
too
were
slipping
constantly
i
had
to
go
very
gingerly
two
deep
furrows
ahead
told
of
ping
passage
i
began
to
wonder
how
adèle
jill
and
jonah
were
getting
on
it
was
when
the
snow
was
perhaps
a
foot
deep
that
we
snarled
past
a
ruined
cabin
and
stumbling
over
the
very
top
of
the
world
began
to
descend
ten
minutes
later
we
came
to
roncevaux
where
abbey
began
or
village
ended
it
was
impossible
to
say
and
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
the
place
looked
like
a
toy
some
baby
giant
had
carried
into
the
mountains
played
with
awhile
and
then
forgotten
here
was
the
last
of
the
snow
so
i
crammed
some
more
into
the
radiator
tried
very
hard
to
think
i
could
see
the
water
and
hoped
for
the
best
while
i
was
doing
this
berry
had
closed
the
car
a
wise
measure
for
though
we
should
lose
a
lot
of
scenery
the
sun
was
sinking
and
evening
was
laying
her
fingers
upon
the
fine
fresh
air
navarre
seemed
very
handsome
it
was
indeed
all
mountains
bleaker
less
intimate
than
france
but
very
very
grand
and
the
road
was
splendidly
laid
its
long
clean
sweeps
its
graceful
curves
the
way
in
which
its
line
befitted
the
bold
landscape
yet
was
presenting
a
style
of
its
own
argued
a
certain
poetry
in
the
hearts
of
its
engineers
we
swept
through
a
village
that
might
have
been
plucked
out
of
macedonia
so
rude
and
stricken
it
looked
there
was
no
glass
in
the
windows
filth
littered
the
naked
street
pigs
and
poultry
rushed
for
the
crazy
doorways
at
our
approach
pampeluna
being
the
nearest
town
i
realised
with
a
shock
what
sort
of
a
night
we
should
spend
if
we
failed
to
get
there
i
began
to
hope
very
hard
that
there
were
no
more
hills
presently
the
road
forked
and
we
switched
to
the
right
maps
and
guide
declared
that
this
was
the
better
way
what
mean
said
my
sister
looking
up
from
the
michelin
guide
i
think
means
said
i
as
for
well
it
got
an
ugly
sound
well
do
look
out
said
daphne
we
shall
be
there
any
minute
this
must
be
espinal
and
that
where
it
begins
berry
cleared
his
throat
the
art
of
life
he
announced
is
to
be
prepared
should
the
car
overturn
and
it
become
necessary
to
ply
me
with
cordial
just
part
my
lips
and
continue
to
pour
until
i
say
should
what
are
you
stopping
for
very
slightly
to
our
rear
said
i
upon
the
side
of
the
road
stands
a
you
may
have
noticed
it
i
did
said
berry
a
particularly
beautiful
specimen
of
the
palaeolithic
epoch
shall
we
go
on
now
supposing
said
i
relentlessly
you
plied
the
radiator
just
take
the
cap
off
and
continue
to
pour
till
i
say
i
should
be
charmed
was
the
reply
unfortunately
i
have
no
vessel
wherewith
to
here
you
are
said
daphne
thrusting
a
hotwater
bottle
into
his
hand
what
a
mercy
i
forgot
to
pack
it
as
i
lighted
a
cigarette
it
is
indeed
said
i
a
godsend
with
an
awful
look
berry
received
the
godsend
and
emerged
from
the
car
after
perhaps
two
minutes
he
reappeared
no
good
he
said
shortly
the
water
too
hard
or
something
the
brute
wo
look
at
it
nonsense
said
daphne
all
right
said
her
husband
you
go
and
tempt
it
i
through
i
am
squeeze
the
air
out
of
it
and
hold
it
under
the
spout
but
i
tell
you
i
took
out
my
watch
in
another
i
said
it
be
dark
and
we
still
forty
kilometres
heavily
berry
disappeared
when
i
next
saw
him
he
was
filling
the
radiator
from
his
hat
after
six
journeys
he
screwed
on
the
cap
and
made
a
rush
for
the
car
but
where
my
bottle
screamed
daphne
i
rejoice
to
say
replied
berry
slamming
the
door
that
full
fathom
five
the
beggar
lies
you
never
dropped
if
it
any
consolation
said
berry
as
i
let
in
the
clutch
he
perished
in
fair
fight
the
swine
put
about
a
bucket
up
each
of
my
sleeves
first
and
then
spat
all
over
my
head
yes
it
is
funny
it
never
mind
game
to
the
last
he
went
down
regurgitating
like
a
couple
of
and
now
i
really
am
i
ca
feel
anything
except
my
trunk
it
was
as
well
that
we
had
taken
in
water
for
very
soon
to
my
dismay
we
began
to
climb
steadily
once
again
we
watered
heaven
knows
how
high
up
at
a
hovel
half
barn
half
cottage
where
a
sturdy
mother
came
lugging
a
great
caldron
before
we
had
named
our
need
in
all
conscience
this
was
obvious
enough
the
smell
of
fiery
metal
was
frightening
me
to
death
mercifully
that
terrible
ascent
was
the
last
as
the
day
was
dying
we
dropped
down
a
long
long
hill
round
two
or
three
bends
and
so
by
gentle
stages
on
to
a
windy
plain
it
was
six
when
we
ran
into
pampeluna
after
paying
an
entrance
fee
we
proceeded
to
the
grand
hotel
it
was
intensely
cold
and
a
wind
cut
like
a
knife
the
streets
were
crowded
and
we
moved
slowly
with
the
result
that
the
eight
urchins
who
decided
to
mount
the
did
so
without
difficulty
the
four
upon
my
side
watched
berry
evict
their
fellows
with
all
the
gratification
of
the
immune
little
brutes
said
daphne
round
to
the
left
boy
that
right
straight
on
look
at
that
one
he
holding
on
by
the
lamp
boy
ca
you
now
to
the
right
here
we
are
where
said
i
slowing
up
here
on
the
right
that
must
be
it
with
the
big
doors
as
i
climbed
out
of
the
car
seven
more
boys
alighted
from
the
dickey
the
wings
the
luggage
and
the
spare
wheels
a
second
later
i
found
myself
in
a
bank
the
edifice
appeared
to
be
deserted
but
after
a
moment
or
two
an
individual
came
shuffling
out
of
the
shadows
my
inability
to
speak
a
word
of
spanish
and
his
inability
to
speak
a
word
of
anything
else
disfavoured
an
intelligent
conversation
but
at
last
i
elicited
first
that
the
grand
hotel
was
next
door
and
secondly
that
it
would
not
be
open
until
july
i
imparted
this
pleasing
information
to
the
others
closed
said
berry
well
that
is
nice
yes
he
quite
right
here
it
is
in
the
guide
from
july
to
october
i
suppose
a
superman
might
have
put
it
more
plainly
but
it
a
pretty
broad
hint
and
now
what
shall
we
do
three
months
is
rather
long
to
wait
especially
as
we
have
had
any
tea
shall
we
force
an
entry
or
go
on
to
madrid
fool
said
daphne
get
in
boy
i
getting
hungry
i
got
in
and
started
the
engine
then
i
got
out
again
with
a
stick
this
the
seven
boys
who
had
remounted
were
not
expecting
i
got
in
again
feeling
better
the
second
hotel
we
visited
was
admirably
concealed
as
we
were
passing
it
for
the
second
time
jonah
came
stepping
across
the
pavement
lucky
for
you
we
got
in
early
he
said
we
got
the
last
two
rooms
they
on
the
fourth
floor
they
miles
apart
they
each
about
the
size
of
a
minute
and
i
do
think
the
beds
are
aired
the
lift
out
of
order
there
no
steam
heat
and
there
are
no
both
the
have
been
let
as
bedrooms
and
the
garage
is
conveniently
situated
about
a
mile
and
a
half
away
the
porter
cut
his
hand
so
you
have
to
carry
up
your
luggage
and
help
me
with
ours
nobody
speaks
anything
but
spanish
but
that
matter
as
much
as
it
might
because
the
waiters
have
struck
and
now
look
sharp
or
we
sha
get
any
dinner
will
bring
you
to
where
we
are
do
talk
do
do
anything
just
get
into
the
i
stared
at
the
words
stupidly
then
i
looked
at
the
chauffeur
standing
hat
in
hand
and
stepped
into
the
depths
of
a
luxurious
limousine
a
moment
later
we
were
whipping
over
the
cobbles
it
was
nearly
seven
and
i
had
just
walked
back
from
the
garage
where
i
had
deposited
pong
whether
my
instructions
that
the
radiator
was
to
be
mended
and
the
car
to
be
washed
had
been
understood
and
would
be
executed
i
was
almost
too
tired
to
care
i
was
also
abominably
cold
the
prospect
of
an
evening
and
night
attended
with
every
circumstance
of
discomfort
was
most
depressing
for
the
fiftieth
time
i
was
wishing
that
we
had
never
come
and
then
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
i
had
been
handed
the
message
there
was
a
in
the
limousine
and
a
voluminous
i
settled
myself
contentedly
what
it
all
meant
i
had
not
the
faintest
idea
enough
that
i
was
comfortable
and
was
beginning
to
grow
warm
my
faith
moreover
in
jonah
was
profound
the
car
drew
up
with
a
rush
before
a
mansion
as
i
stepped
out
the
chauffeur
removed
his
hat
and
the
front
door
was
opened
i
passed
up
the
steps
into
the
grateful
shelter
of
a
tremendous
hall
at
once
my
coat
and
hat
were
taken
from
me
and
i
was
reverently
invited
to
ascend
the
huge
staircase
i
did
so
in
silence
at
the
top
of
the
flight
a
received
me
and
led
the
way
everywhere
luxury
was
in
evidence
there
were
plenty
of
lights
but
they
were
all
heavily
shaded
so
thick
were
the
carpets
that
i
could
hardly
hear
my
own
footfalls
the
atmosphere
was
pleasantly
warm
and
full
of
the
sweet
scent
of
burning
wood
what
furniture
i
saw
was
very
handsome
three
exquisite
stalls
filched
from
some
old
cathedral
stood
for
a
settle
a
magnificent
bronze
loomed
in
a
recess
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
glowing
a
great
canaletto
i
followed
my
guide
wonderingly
a
moment
later
she
stopped
to
knock
upon
a
door
who
is
it
cried
adèle
i
raised
my
voice
and
she
called
to
me
to
enter
i
opened
the
door
into
the
finest
bedroom
that
i
have
ever
seen
upon
the
walls
were
panels
of
yellow
silk
and
all
the
silks
and
stuffs
were
grey
or
golden
a
soft
grey
carpet
a
deep
sofa
a
giant
a
mighty
press
a
chairs
mirrors
all
were
in
beautiful
taste
an
open
door
in
one
corner
admitting
the
flash
of
tiles
promised
a
on
the
bed
my
which
i
had
packed
for
san
sebastian
lay
orderly
and
there
upon
a
chair
in
front
of
a
blazing
fire
sat
adèle
lightly
clothed
looking
extraordinarily
girlish
and
cheerfully
inveigling
a
stocking
on
to
a
small
white
foot
i
looked
round
dazedly
is
it
priceless
said
adèle
is
it
all
priceless
she
danced
across
the
room
and
flung
her
arms
round
my
neck
and
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
i
wanted
to
wait
for
you
lad
but
they
would
let
me
but
i
run
a
bath
for
you
and
put
out
all
your
clothes
by
the
way
i
ca
find
your
links
anywhere
are
you
sure
no
i
said
i
not
i
not
sure
of
anything
i
not
sure
awake
i
not
sure
i
alive
i
not
sure
i
not
mad
i
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
what
are
you
doing
here
what
am
i
doing
here
where
are
we
what
it
all
mean
my
darling
said
adèle
i
not
the
faintest
idea
but
listen
you
had
been
gone
five
minutes
before
a
man
came
into
the
hotel
and
up
to
jonah
he
seemed
very
nervous
and
excited
but
he
was
very
polite
he
could
speak
a
word
of
anything
but
spanish
but
at
last
we
gathered
that
he
was
asking
us
if
we
were
the
people
who
had
wired
to
the
grand
hotel
when
we
said
that
we
were
he
talked
faster
than
ever
and
at
last
we
began
to
understand
that
he
got
some
rooms
for
us
elsewhere
you
can
imagine
our
joy
once
we
understood
he
did
have
to
ask
us
whether
we
come
the
next
minute
two
chauffeurs
were
slinging
the
baggage
on
to
a
couple
of
cars
and
after
we
managed
to
explain
that
you
were
coming
back
berry
paid
some
sort
of
a
bill
and
we
all
pushed
off
when
we
saw
this
wonderful
house
we
nearly
fainted
as
far
as
i
can
see
we
got
it
all
to
ourselves
berry
and
daphne
are
in
another
room
like
this
about
two
doors
away
and
jill
between
us
i
do
know
where
jonah
is
i
can
only
imagine
that
the
man
who
came
is
the
manager
of
the
grand
hotel
and
that
this
is
where
they
put
people
when
their
own
place
is
closed
unsatisfactory
as
it
was
this
seemed
roughly
the
only
possible
explanation
indeed
but
for
the
magnificence
of
our
lodging
it
would
have
been
reasonable
enough
still
we
knew
nothing
of
spain
perhaps
this
was
their
idea
of
hospitality
i
began
to
like
pampeluna
very
much
by
the
time
i
had
had
a
hot
bath
i
had
begun
to
wonder
whether
it
was
worth
while
going
on
to
san
sebastian
we
had
dined
in
state
we
had
eaten
an
dinner
superbly
cooked
and
admirably
served
at
the
conclusion
of
our
meal
folding
doors
had
been
opened
and
we
had
passed
into
the
shadowed
comfort
of
a
gorgeous
library
where
only
the
ceaseless
flicker
of
a
great
log
fire
had
lighted
us
to
chairs
and
a
rich
sofa
where
coffee
and
liqueurs
were
set
upon
a
low
table
and
the
broad
flash
of
silver
showed
a
massive
reposing
conveniently
upon
an
ebony
stool
with
one
consent
sitting
at
the
feet
of
epicurus
we
had
thrust
uncertainty
aside
and
thanking
heaven
that
we
had
fallen
so
magically
upon
our
own
confined
our
conversation
to
the
events
of
our
journey
and
compared
enthusiastic
notes
regarding
the
wonders
entertainments
and
perils
of
our
drive
from
behind
a
big
cigar
berry
was
slowly
enumerating
the
accessories
without
which
to
make
life
worth
living
no
car
should
ever
take
the
road
when
the
door
opened
and
a
servant
bearing
a
salver
entered
the
room
stopping
for
an
instant
to
switch
on
the
light
the
man
stepped
to
my
for
a
moment
berry
glanced
at
the
card
then
english
he
said
hubert
weston
hallilay
calle
de
serrano
madrid
better
have
him
in
had
we
he
turned
to
the
servant
and
nodded
ask
him
to
come
in
he
said
the
servant
bowed
and
withdrew
a
moment
later
a
boy
perhaps
years
old
was
ushered
into
the
room
he
greeted
us
respectfully
but
with
an
delight
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
how
do
i
most
awfully
glad
to
see
you
officially
i
here
by
request
the
comic
mayor
got
hold
of
me
he
worried
to
death
because
he
ca
converse
with
you
i
do
suppose
you
mind
but
shortening
his
life
i
had
a
fearful
time
with
him
there
are
about
a
thousand
things
he
wants
to
know
and
he
commissioned
me
to
find
them
out
without
asking
any
questions
that
he
says
would
be
most
rude
unofficially
i
well
i
at
your
service
if
i
known
you
were
coming
i
have
been
here
before
i
attached
to
madrid
really
but
i
putting
in
six
weeks
here
for
my
sins
you
very
kind
said
berry
incidentally
you
a
godsend
the
second
we
had
the
first
i
may
say
lies
in
five
feet
of
water
on
a
particularly
blasted
but
do
be
disconcerted
we
should
think
of
drowning
you
for
one
thing
you
much
too
valuable
and
now
sit
down
and
have
some
cold
coffee
and
a
glass
of
kummel
as
he
sank
into
a
seat
hallilay
said
daphne
twittering
i
ca
bear
it
are
we
here
the
boy
looked
at
her
curiously
then
well
he
said
there
was
no
other
place
even
if
the
grand
had
been
open
i
gather
it
hardly
fit
of
course
there
been
the
most
awful
trust
spain
for
that
the
post
office
knew
they
could
deliver
the
wire
instead
of
telling
somebody
or
communicating
with
pau
they
let
it
lie
in
the
office
till
this
afternoon
then
they
took
it
to
the
mayor
of
course
he
nearly
died
but
being
a
man
of
action
he
got
a
move
on
he
flew
round
here
and
laid
the
facts
before
the
steward
the
owner
happens
to
be
away
and
arranged
to
put
this
house
at
your
disposal
then
he
rushed
round
borrowed
a
couple
of
cars
and
spent
what
time
he
had
left
splitting
his
brain
over
your
wire
and
hovering
between
the
station
and
the
various
approaches
to
pampeluna
as
an
inevitable
result
he
missed
you
and
when
he
finally
had
the
of
inquiring
at
the
grand
and
found
you
already
arrived
he
nearly
shot
himself
but
why
i
mean
i
stammered
it
devilish
good
of
the
mayor
and
you
and
everyone
but
why
in
the
first
place
why
did
the
post
office
take
the
wire
to
the
mayor
hallilay
raised
his
eyebrows
well
he
said
slowly
when
they
saw
the
telegram
they
realised
who
sent
the
wire
said
berry
i
did
said
jonah
i
said
lundi
soir
deux
grandes
deux
petites
chambres
avec
salle
de
bain
en
suite
arrive
en
for
a
moment
i
thought
the
boy
was
going
to
faint
then
he
covered
his
face
and
began
to
shake
with
laughter
presently
he
plucked
a
form
from
his
pocket
unfolded
it
and
handed
it
to
me
that
may
have
been
what
you
sent
he
said
jerkily
but
here
how
the
wire
arrived
lundi
soir
deux
grandes
deux
petites
chambres
avec
salle
de
bain
suite
arrive
en
after
i
had
read
it
aloud
there
was
a
long
long
silence
at
length
i
see
said
berry
i
knew
our
journey
would
be
eventful
because
my
wife
put
her
teeth
in
upside
down
this
morning
but
i
little
dreamed
it
was
to
be
a
royal
progress
however
i
take
it
one
of
the
things
the
mayor
would
like
to
know
is
er
what
has
become
of
of
hallilay
nodded
tearfully
that
sir
he
said
is
the
first
and
foremost
question
upon
an
unanswerable
list
we
left
pampeluna
upon
the
following
afternoon
in
response
to
a
wire
from
san
sebastian
peremptorily
desiring
us
immediately
to
repair
to
that
resort
hallilay
as
good
as
his
word
was
of
inestimable
service
he
had
indeed
dealt
with
the
delicate
situation
with
admirable
judgment
finally
he
covered
our
retreat
in
a
masterly
manner
from
the
first
he
had
insisted
that
the
we
had
unconsciously
assumed
must
be
deliberately
maintained
our
scruples
he
had
brushed
to
one
side
whatever
happens
pampeluna
must
never
know
the
truth
it
be
most
unpleasant
for
you
obviously
for
the
mayor
well
spaniards
are
very
proud
and
i
think
it
kill
him
very
well
then
your
course
plainly
is
the
line
of
least
resistance
o
friends
romans
countrymen
it
it
too
easy
he
broke
off
and
glanced
meaningly
about
him
i
not
much
of
a
diplomat
but
well
the
best
is
good
enough
for
me
talk
about
epicurus
chapter
viii
how
adèle
bought
a
bottle
of
perfume
which
had
no
smell
and
i
cut
eulalie
dead
i
must
have
a
paper
said
berry
i
have
read
the
news
for
hours
and
and
anything
may
have
happened
supposing
the
rouble
and
the
shilling
have
changed
over
the
tie
i
wearing
be
worth
about
six
hundred
pounds
i
set
down
my
cup
and
picked
up
the
receiver
so
you
really
off
are
you
said
an
attractive
voice
do
miss
fuenterrabia
it
only
five
miles
out
of
your
way
and
it
worth
seeing
they
sell
most
lovely
scent
in
the
calle
del
puerto
ask
for
their
violets
with
a
chunk
i
was
disconnected
and
a
second
later
a
bureau
clerk
had
promised
to
procure
an
english
paper
and
send
it
up
to
my
room
less
than
an
hour
ago
we
had
arrived
at
san
sebastian
according
to
plan
a
very
handsome
run
had
ended
becomingly
enough
in
the
drive
of
a
palatial
hotel
and
though
it
was
growing
dusk
as
we
had
slipped
into
the
town
we
had
seen
quite
enough
of
our
surroundings
to
appreciate
that
where
nature
had
succeeded
so
admirably
man
had
by
no
means
failed
and
now
we
were
taking
tea
in
my
sister
bedroom
and
discussing
what
berry
called
the
order
of
going
in
we
better
decide
right
away
said
my
to
stay
here
a
week
it
perfectly
obvious
that
two
nights
are
going
to
be
no
earthly
all
you
thinking
of
said
daphne
is
the
casino
i
knew
it
would
be
like
this
all
right
replied
her
husband
look
at
the
we
seen
this
place
yet
and
there
are
twelve
excursions
all
highly
recommended
we
can
cut
out
tolosa
because
i
see
we
did
that
this
afternoon
that
was
where
the
child
lobbed
the
into
the
car
i
fancy
i
passed
the
cathedral
when
i
was
chasing
him
any
way
i
shall
say
so
i
am
told
said
i
that
fuenterrabia
worth
seeing
it
the
show
place
about
here
said
jonah
old
as
the
hills
that
take
a
morning
alone
i
yawned
there
a
shop
there
i
said
in
the
calle
del
puerto
where
they
sell
some
wonderful
scent
i
believe
it
all
good
but
their
violets
is
simply
ravishing
the
girls
pricked
up
their
ears
who
told
you
all
this
said
adèle
i
ca
imagine
said
i
truthfully
but
she
had
a
nice
voice
you
know
one
of
those
soft
mellifluous
ones
suggesting
that
she
bored
to
distraction
with
everything
except
you
i
took
out
a
cigarette
and
looked
about
me
anyone
got
a
match
i
added
blow
the
matches
said
my
sister
when
did
all
this
happen
this
afternoon
said
i
i
always
heard
that
san
sebastian
is
she
staying
here
said
adèle
in
the
hotel
she
did
say
but
how
did
you
come
to
speak
to
her
demanded
my
wife
i
did
i
said
she
spoke
to
me
i
tell
you
i
always
heard
that
san
and
you
communed
with
her
said
berry
with
your
lawful
wife
working
herself
to
death
on
the
first
floor
unpacking
your
you
exchanged
secrets
of
the
toilet
with
a
vamp
oh
you
vicious
libertine
will
she
be
at
the
casino
i
did
ask
her
berry
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
you
do
know
her
name
you
never
asked
where
she
staying
and
you
fixed
nothing
up
he
sighed
heavily
some
people
deserve
to
get
on
i
had
time
i
pleaded
we
got
on
to
scent
almost
at
once
why
scent
said
jonah
or
is
that
an
indiscreet
question
oh
that
easy
said
berry
the
scent
was
on
the
handkerchief
he
picked
up
it
been
done
before
i
do
understand
said
jill
i
glad
you
do
darling
one
expert
in
the
family
is
bad
enough
he
nodded
at
me
i
used
to
think
i
was
useful
till
i
seen
that
mormon
at
work
talk
about
getting
off
why
he
click
at
a
jumble
sale
would
he
really
said
adèle
interestedly
i
no
idea
he
was
so
enterprising
berry
shrugged
his
shoulders
my
dear
he
said
he
a
blinkin
marvel
where
you
and
i
be
standing
outside
a
with
a
nervous
grin
and
a
bag
of
jujubes
he
walk
straight
up
to
a
marchioness
say
feel
i
must
tell
you
that
you
got
a
mouth
in
a
million
and
away
with
but
there
you
are
in
the
present
case
for
once
in
a
way
said
adèle
the
lady
seems
to
have
made
the
running
she
turned
to
me
with
a
smile
well
juan
me
lad
tell
us
some
more
about
her
was
she
fair
or
dark
i
nodded
at
berry
better
ask
him
i
said
he
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do
she
was
dark
said
berry
unhesitatingly
a
tall
willowy
wench
with
continental
eyes
and
an
everlasting
pout
am
i
right
sir
you
may
be
said
i
not
having
seen
the
damsel
there
was
an
outburst
of
incredulous
objection
sorry
i
added
but
the
liaison
was
conducted
upon
the
telephone
just
now
when
i
ordered
the
paper
the
lady
had
no
idea
she
was
giving
me
counsel
so
you
see
we
both
blameless
and
now
may
i
have
a
match
well
i
am
disappointed
announced
adèle
i
quite
thought
we
were
off
so
did
i
said
daphne
and
you
never
even
oh
it
spoiled
my
tea
even
jill
protested
that
i
had
led
them
on
in
some
dudgeon
i
began
to
wonder
if
i
should
ever
understand
women
an
hour
and
a
half
had
slipped
by
ready
for
dinner
with
twenty
minutes
to
spare
i
had
descended
to
the
lounge
there
a
large
had
suggested
the
propriety
of
sending
a
postcard
to
the
sweetest
of
aunts
who
in
the
absence
of
evidence
to
the
contrary
invariably
presumed
our
death
after
fourteen
days
there
being
no
postcards
available
i
started
a
letter
for
a
page
and
a
half
my
pen
ran
easily
enough
and
then
for
no
reason
whatever
my
epistolary
sense
faltered
laboured
and
ceased
to
function
i
what
i
had
written
touched
up
the
punctuation
and
fingered
my
chin
i
reviewed
the
past
i
contemplated
the
future
i
regarded
my
all
to
no
effect
there
was
simply
nothing
to
say
finally
i
rose
and
went
in
search
of
a
waiter
there
was
i
felt
a
chance
that
a
martini
might
stimulate
my
brain
i
returned
to
my
seat
to
find
that
while
i
had
been
gone
a
heifer
from
another
herd
had
come
to
drink
at
the
pool
immediately
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
sat
one
of
the
prettiest
women
that
i
have
ever
seen
her
colouring
was
superb
beneath
a
skin
all
the
wild
beauty
of
a
glowed
in
her
cheeks
each
time
she
moved
a
flashing
mystery
of
red
and
golden
lights
blazed
from
the
auburn
crown
piled
on
her
head
stars
danced
an
invitation
in
the
great
grey
eyes
her
small
straight
nose
the
exquisite
line
of
her
face
her
fairy
mouth
alone
would
have
redeemed
the
meanest
countenance
a
plain
black
velvet
dress
cut
rather
high
at
the
throat
but
leaving
her
lovely
arms
bare
from
the
shoulder
and
a
complete
absence
of
jewellery
showed
that
my
lady
knew
how
pictures
should
be
framed
with
an
effort
i
bent
to
my
letter
from
being
difficult
however
the
composition
of
another
two
pages
of
coherent
prose
had
become
formidable
turning
to
the
past
i
could
remember
nothing
looking
into
the
future
i
found
myself
blind
as
for
the
present
i
felt
instinctively
that
a
description
of
the
curve
of
my
mouth
would
be
out
of
place
and
might
be
misunderstood
i
observed
suddenly
that
my
lady
had
stopped
writing
after
a
moment
she
read
over
what
she
had
written
and
put
in
two
commas
then
she
put
a
dash
at
the
end
of
her
last
sentence
such
an
addition
had
not
occurred
to
me
for
what
it
was
worth
i
adopted
it
surreptitiously
when
i
looked
up
the
tips
of
four
pointed
fingers
were
being
regarded
with
some
severity
finally
the
girl
laid
down
her
pen
and
propping
her
chin
on
two
ridiculous
fists
stared
dismally
upon
the
neutral
zone
between
our
respective
blotting
pads
have
you
dealt
with
the
weather
said
i
the
stars
which
had
stopped
dancing
leaped
again
into
life
fully
she
said
and
the
place
she
nodded
and
the
people
staying
in
the
hotel
i
just
said
they
all
very
dull
i
wrote
rapidly
then
people
here
i
read
nearly
all
very
dull
for
a
moment
she
looked
at
me
then
she
picked
up
her
pen
how
she
demanded
with
a
dazzling
smile
do
you
spell
only
one
i
replied
same
as
went
down
rather
shakily
i
pulled
up
my
cuffs
furniture
i
said
following
my
pen
like
the
spanish
on
the
large
side
everything
is
too
big
too
big
said
my
lady
with
her
head
on
one
side
you
see
my
confidence
in
you
is
supreme
one
moment
said
i
there
only
one
in
is
there
yes
she
said
bubbling
same
as
i
cleared
my
throat
table
for
instance
i
continued
which
we
i
am
writing
is
simply
huge
if
it
were
only
half
as
wide
it
would
be
much
more
er
convenient
the
two
white
shoulders
began
to
shake
with
laughter
i
thought
very
swiftly
then
new
paragraph
i
said
half
a
page
more
breathed
my
companion
i
frowned
have
i
announced
a
good
casino
here
our
two
pens
recorded
the
statement
great
thing
to
do
is
to
go
there
after
dinner
the
custom
was
reported
in
duplicate
i
not
going
said
the
girl
but
i
got
to
do
my
packing
i
groaned
then
i
sha
go
i
declared
i
going
to
help
a
friend
pack
i
looked
up
cheerfully
yes
shall
look
forward
she
said
smiling
seeing
you
again
some
time
the
pretty
head
went
to
one
side
my
love
she
said
quietly
devoted
servant
said
i
for
a
second
my
lady
hesitated
then
she
signed
a
name
crammed
her
letter
into
an
envelope
and
rose
to
her
feet
the
stars
in
the
wonderful
eyes
had
become
misty
and
there
was
a
strange
wistful
curve
to
the
exquisite
lips
for
an
instant
we
looked
at
one
another
then
just
she
said
the
next
moment
she
was
gone
i
turned
to
see
daphne
adèle
and
berry
a
dozen
paces
away
i
advanced
with
what
composure
i
could
summon
i
have
been
endeavouring
i
said
to
atone
for
this
afternoon
there
was
a
frosty
silence
then
so
i
see
said
my
sister
icily
berry
passed
a
hand
across
his
eyes
ugh
he
said
shuddering
i
gone
all
goosegogs
i
mean
gooseflesh
will
she
be
at
the
casino
my
wife
set
a
hand
upon
my
arm
i
must
admit
she
said
smiling
that
she
had
a
mouth
in
a
million
by
ten
the
next
morning
we
were
again
upon
the
road
the
almanack
swore
it
was
march
but
here
was
a
summer
day
not
a
cloud
was
floating
in
the
great
blue
sky
down
to
the
tenderest
breeze
the
winds
were
sleeping
the
sun
was
in
all
his
glory
for
earth
herself
the
stains
of
winter
were
being
done
away
out
of
the
country
coat
the
greys
and
browns
lately
so
prominent
were
fading
notably
as
thick
as
fast
the
green
was
coming
in
as
we
rounded
a
bend
and
sailed
down
a
long
sweet
hill
towards
the
frontier
the
road
was
all
dappled
with
the
shadows
of
youngster
leaves
our
way
seemed
popular
car
after
car
swept
by
waggons
and
lorries
went
rumbling
about
their
business
now
and
again
two
of
the
guardia
civil
conspicuously
armed
and
in
their
accoutrements
sat
stiff
silent
and
vigilant
in
the
mouth
of
an
odd
come
to
the
skirts
of
irun
we
switched
to
the
left
and
five
minutes
later
we
were
at
fuenterrabia
a
city
with
a
main
street
some
four
yards
wide
keeping
a
palace
if
hatchments
be
evidence
remembering
more
dukes
than
shopkeepers
its
upholding
a
haphazard
host
of
balconies
and
overhung
with
monstrous
eaves
a
pocket
stronghold
set
on
the
lip
of
spain
staring
at
sea
and
land
each
sunlit
rood
of
which
is
fat
with
history
a
lovely
star
upon
the
breast
of
fame
chosen
by
english
poets
to
enrich
their
songs
fuenterrabia
is
among
the
crown
jewels
of
europe
we
thrust
up
the
calle
mayor
and
into
the
plaza
de
armas
there
we
put
the
cars
in
the
shade
and
alighted
eagerly
to
view
the
town
at
close
quarters
look
at
that
little
boy
cried
jill
eating
an
apple
where
the
camera
get
him
to
stand
in
the
sun
boy
against
that
old
wall
that
right
said
berry
and
there
a
dog
scratching
himself
ask
him
to
devil
his
tenants
beside
the
post
office
if
we
get
a
good
picture
we
can
call
it
affection
or
the
old
old
and
send
it
to
to
humour
my
cousin
whim
i
approached
a
child
despite
my
assurances
of
however
the
urchin
retired
as
i
advanced
all
the
time
consuming
his
apple
with
a
nervous
energy
which
suggested
at
once
a
conviction
that
i
had
my
eye
upon
his
fruit
and
a
determination
to
confound
my
strategy
the
apple
was
dwindling
fast
and
redoubling
my
protests
i
quickened
my
pace
for
a
second
the
boy
hesitated
then
he
took
two
last
devastating
bites
flung
the
core
in
my
face
and
took
to
his
heels
pursuit
being
out
of
the
question
i
returned
furiously
to
the
others
to
find
them
as
was
to
be
expected
quite
weak
with
laughter
it
good
of
you
boy
declared
jill
tearfully
and
i
got
such
a
precious
picture
just
as
he
threw
it
i
suppose
you
know
i
said
stiffly
that
he
hit
me
upon
the
nose
there
must
said
berry
have
been
some
misunderstanding
the
spaniard
courtesy
is
proverbial
you
sure
you
were
rude
to
him
brother
certain
said
i
grimly
dear
dear
said
my
opening
a
it
most
mysterious
just
listen
to
this
stranger
is
at
first
apt
to
be
carried
away
by
the
obliging
tone
of
society
by
the
charming
spontaneity
of
manner
and
by
the
somewhat
exaggerated
politeness
of
the
people
he
there
now
were
you
carried
away
at
all
i
mean
if
you
were
i
was
not
said
berry
returned
to
the
book
should
return
these
civilities
in
kind
but
he
should
avoid
turning
the
conversation
on
serious
matters
and
should
above
all
refrain
from
expressing
an
opinion
on
religious
or
political
i
do
hope
you
did
i
shook
my
head
then
said
berry
should
we
meet
the
child
again
i
shall
cut
him
dead
and
that
that
and
now
let
go
and
find
a
dairy
you
be
wanting
a
for
an
hour
and
a
half
we
went
about
the
city
we
marked
her
bulwarks
we
told
her
towers
we
observed
her
mansions
we
strolled
upon
her
terraces
we
enjoyed
her
prospects
last
of
all
we
visited
the
calle
del
puerto
before
we
had
taken
a
dozen
paces
along
the
aged
alley
a
faint
odour
of
perfume
began
to
assert
itself
and
a
few
seconds
later
we
were
standing
before
a
tiny
shop
scrupulously
sweet
and
clean
to
look
upon
absurdly
suggestive
of
the
patronage
of
marionettes
a
curtain
of
canvas
was
swaying
in
the
low
doorway
while
an
awning
of
the
same
stuff
guarded
a
peepshow
window
which
was
barely
three
feet
long
and
less
than
one
foot
high
herein
ranged
behind
a
slab
of
fine
stood
three
plain
stoppered
phials
one
one
green
and
one
a
faint
yellow
below
on
a
grey
silk
pillow
was
set
a
small
book
this
was
open
in
capitals
of
gold
upon
the
pages
displayed
were
two
words
only
parfums
français
the
effect
was
charming
we
gathered
about
the
window
ejaculating
surprise
in
said
jonah
and
then
you
wrong
the
rue
de
la
paix
is
in
it
which
is
a
description
i
can
not
better
daphne
lifted
the
and
we
followed
her
in
passing
suddenly
out
of
the
brilliant
sunshine
we
could
at
first
see
nothing
then
gradually
the
interior
of
the
shop
took
shape
there
was
no
counter
but
an
oblong
mahogany
table
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
polished
floor
evidently
was
discharging
that
office
upon
this
stood
three
other
phials
similar
to
those
displayed
in
the
window
but
fitted
with
sprays
instead
of
stoppers
in
front
of
each
a
grey
slip
of
silk
laid
between
the
glass
and
the
mahogany
declared
its
contents
rose
bleue
lys
noir
jasmin
gris
the
room
was
very
low
and
the
walls
were
panelled
upon
these
except
for
that
framing
the
door
and
window
were
rows
of
shelves
on
these
at
decent
intervals
stood
phials
of
four
different
sizes
to
judge
from
the
colour
of
their
glass
each
wall
was
devoted
to
one
of
the
three
scents
that
facing
us
was
green
that
on
our
left
that
upon
our
right
a
faint
yellow
a
black
curtain
in
a
corner
suggested
a
doorway
leading
to
another
part
of
the
house
the
air
naturally
enough
was
full
of
perfume
we
stared
about
us
in
silence
after
waiting
perhaps
five
minutes
peering
unsuccessfully
behind
the
curtain
raising
our
voices
in
talk
and
finally
rapping
upon
the
table
without
attracting
attendance
we
decided
to
return
to
where
we
had
left
the
cars
and
visit
the
shop
again
on
our
way
out
of
the
town
as
we
came
to
the
plaza
the
clock
of
the
great
church
announced
the
hour
a
quarter
to
one
good
heavens
cried
daphne
checking
the
time
by
her
i
no
idea
it
was
so
late
and
i
left
word
for
evelyn
to
ring
me
up
at
the
hotel
at
one
we
made
a
rush
for
the
cars
can
it
be
done
jonah
only
by
air
said
my
cousin
outside
a
track
thirteen
miles
in
fourteen
minutes
is
just
a
shade
too
thick
still
there
nothing
the
matter
with
the
road
after
irun
and
evelyn
may
be
delayed
getting
through
he
swung
himself
into
ping
and
started
her
up
my
sister
and
jill
scrambled
aboard
while
he
was
turning
her
round
as
he
headed
for
the
calle
mayor
stop
shrieked
his
sister
the
scent
jonah
the
scent
we
got
to
go
back
jonah
threw
out
the
clutch
we
get
that
cried
adèle
you
go
on
and
we
follow
right
the
next
moment
ping
had
dropped
out
of
sight
it
was
perhaps
five
minutes
later
that
after
conjuring
berry
to
stay
where
he
was
and
move
the
car
for
nobody
i
assisted
my
wife
on
to
the
pavement
when
fuenterrabia
was
planned
an
was
not
considered
to
wheedle
pong
to
the
mouth
of
the
calle
del
puerto
had
been
a
ticklish
business
and
i
had
berthed
her
deliberately
with
an
eye
to
our
departure
for
the
city
gate
rather
than
to
the
convenience
of
such
other
vehicles
as
might
appear
besides
for
my
to
have
essayed
manoeuvres
in
such
surroundings
would
have
been
asking
for
trouble
as
adèle
and
i
hastened
along
the
street
we
must
look
sharp
i
insisted
she
half
across
the
fairway
if
anybody
with
anything
broader
than
a
mule
feels
they
ca
wait
there
be
murder
done
we
came
to
the
shop
panting
the
place
was
just
as
we
had
left
it
and
there
was
no
one
there
i
looked
round
impatiently
what
on
earth
i
began
is
the
good
of
a
as
i
spoke
the
curtain
in
the
corner
was
pushed
to
one
side
and
a
french
girl
entered
the
room
her
manner
was
most
curious
for
a
moment
she
hesitated
as
though
she
would
turn
and
fly
then
with
her
eyes
upon
adèle
she
moved
slowly
forward
she
seemed
to
be
making
an
effort
to
come
and
serve
us
that
she
was
most
apprehensive
was
perfectly
plain
between
curtain
and
table
she
stopped
then
she
put
a
hand
to
her
throat
desires
something
some
scent
please
said
adèle
reassuringly
her
cheerful
tone
appeared
to
encourage
the
girl
and
when
my
wife
pointed
to
the
green
phial
and
asked
to
be
sprayed
with
its
contents
i
could
have
sworn
her
attitude
was
that
of
relief
in
a
flash
she
had
produced
a
small
square
of
linen
this
she
handed
to
adèle
smell
see
it
is
scentless
she
sprayed
it
with
scent
that
is
the
lily
adèle
passed
it
to
me
the
scent
was
exquisite
it
delicious
said
adèle
yes
it
is
good
will
sample
the
others
if
you
please
fresh
squares
of
linen
were
produced
offered
for
inspection
and
sprayed
each
perfume
seemed
more
ravishing
than
its
predecessor
to
test
the
worth
of
this
impression
we
reverted
to
the
lily
one
breath
of
this
satisfied
us
that
it
was
the
best
of
the
lot
to
be
quite
sure
we
smelt
the
rose
and
were
instantly
convinced
of
its
superiority
to
its
fellows
a
return
to
the
jasmine
persuaded
us
that
there
was
only
one
scent
in
the
shop
it
was
indeed
impossible
to
award
the
palm
each
perfume
had
some
irresistible
virtue
which
the
others
lacked
when
at
last
adèle
implored
me
to
help
her
to
a
decision
i
spoke
to
the
point
there
only
one
thing
to
do
we
ca
wait
now
so
have
a
big
bottle
of
each
then
you
and
jill
and
daphne
can
fight
it
out
at
home
adèle
asked
the
price
of
the
scents
they
are
all
the
same
price
the
large
bottle
one
hundred
the
others
seventy
fifty
and
thirty
according
to
size
very
well
i
take
a
large
bottle
of
each
thank
you
a
prolonged
and
vicious
croak
from
the
end
of
the
street
argued
that
berry
patience
was
wearing
thin
but
to
have
asked
the
girl
to
make
haste
would
have
been
supererogatory
in
a
trice
three
phials
had
been
taken
down
from
their
shelves
and
three
stout
cases
of
the
pattern
of
boxes
had
been
produced
the
phial
went
into
its
tray
the
tray
into
its
sheath
the
case
complete
into
a
sheet
of
rough
grey
paper
and
the
whole
was
girt
with
cord
in
next
to
no
time
as
the
last
knot
was
being
tied
adèle
touched
me
upon
the
arm
i
almost
forgot
she
said
then
she
turned
to
the
girl
i
have
been
told
to
ask
for
your
violets
the
scissors
the
girl
was
using
fell
to
the
floor
as
she
recovered
them
certainly
she
whispered
laying
a
trembling
hand
upon
the
curtain
behind
she
disappeared
to
reappear
almost
immediately
with
a
package
precisely
similar
to
those
she
had
just
made
up
she
placed
it
with
the
others
oh
said
adèle
but
you
have
a
perfect
hurricane
of
croaks
mingled
with
cries
of
anger
interrupted
her
never
mind
i
cried
gathering
up
the
parcels
how
much
is
it
now
four
hundred
i
suppose
as
i
was
counting
the
notes
a
yell
of
anguish
in
berry
unmistakable
accents
fell
upon
my
ears
i
threw
the
money
upon
the
table
and
bolted
out
of
the
shop
with
adèle
at
my
heels
as
we
came
to
the
corner
i
ran
full
tilt
into
eulalie
for
an
instant
our
eyes
met
but
she
looked
away
pointedly
slipped
to
one
side
and
passed
on
then
to
you
sir
roared
berry
look
at
my
wing
yes
i
see
the
cabriolet
but
what
of
that
it
perfectly
happy
no
it
want
to
get
by
and
if
it
had
oh
go
and
push
yourself
off
somewhere
here
he
caught
sight
of
me
see
what
this
greasy
pantaloon
done
i
told
him
he
had
room
but
he
would
wait
and
now
he
shoving
it
on
to
that
cabriolet
oh
why
ca
i
speak
spanish
i
give
him
earache
i
thrust
our
packages
into
the
fold
of
the
hood
and
ran
to
examine
the
wing
happily
the
damage
was
slight
i
announced
this
relievedly
i
daresay
it
is
raged
berry
as
we
resumed
our
seats
what
i
object
to
is
the
poisonous
hostility
of
the
brute
he
blinkin
well
meant
to
do
it
dear
dear
said
adèle
bubbling
there
must
have
been
some
misunderstanding
the
spaniard
courtesy
is
proverbial
exactly
said
i
the
stranger
is
at
first
apt
to
be
carried
away
by
the
exaggerated
politeness
of
the
you
may
be
said
berry
as
blasphemous
as
you
like
but
for
the
love
of
the
home
for
little
children
let
get
out
of
this
town
i
let
in
the
clutch
we
were
passing
out
of
the
beautiful
armoried
gateway
when
an
approaching
peasant
signalled
to
us
to
stop
and
pointed
excitedly
back
the
way
we
had
come
the
fellow
manner
suggested
that
we
had
dropped
something
i
pulled
up
the
car
opened
my
door
and
jumped
out
as
i
did
so
a
breathless
eulalie
appeared
upon
the
other
side
of
the
car
i
never
thought
i
should
catch
you
she
said
uncertainly
my
car
got
mixed
up
with
that
waggon
so
i
chanced
it
and
ran
and
now
here
i
hardly
know
how
to
tell
you
she
addressed
herself
to
adèle
but
i
fancy
you
got
my
scent
violets
rather
rather
special
they
only
make
it
by
request
and
a
friend
of
mine
had
ordered
a
bottle
for
me
it
was
put
ready
for
me
to
call
for
and
as
far
as
i
can
make
out
they
given
it
to
you
by
mistake
i
i
afraid
i
asking
an
awful
lot
but
might
i
have
it
leaving
spain
altogether
in
half
an
hour
so
i
sha
have
another
chance
i
never
remember
feeling
so
utterly
disillusioned
recalling
the
telephone
conversation
of
the
day
before
i
was
frankly
disgusted
such
sharp
practice
as
this
smacked
of
a
bargain
sale
the
scent
was
ours
we
had
bought
it
fairly
besides
it
had
been
reserved
if
either
adèle
or
eulalie
had
to
go
empty
away
law
and
equity
alike
were
pronouncing
in
favour
of
my
wife
adèle
was
speaking
oh
certainly
boy
will
you
i
stepped
into
the
car
and
thrust
a
hand
into
the
fold
of
the
hood
i
shall
know
which
it
is
the
paper
it
wrapped
in
is
different
there
a
line
running
through
it
and
the
others
were
plain
i
plucked
out
a
case
and
gave
it
to
her
to
examine
that
right
gravely
she
handed
it
to
eulalie
sorry
you
had
to
run
so
she
added
gently
the
other
shrugged
her
shoulders
i
caught
you
she
said
simply
and
that
the
great
thing
she
glanced
over
her
shoulder
and
here
comes
my
car
i
really
most
awfully
grateful
with
a
swish
the
cabriolet
swept
alongside
skidded
with
locked
wheels
upon
the
pavement
and
fetched
up
anyhow
with
its
bonnet
across
our
bows
it
was
a
piece
of
driving
for
which
the
chauffeur
ought
to
have
been
flogged
most
awfully
grateful
repeated
eulalie
swinging
the
case
by
its
cord
you
you
might
have
made
it
much
harder
the
next
moment
she
was
in
the
cabriolet
dazedly
i
watched
the
latter
float
out
of
sight
she
has
paid
i
stammered
she
never
given
us
the
money
four
pounds
that
bottle
cost
we
stared
at
one
another
in
dismay
at
length
stung
said
berry
but
what
a
beautiful
bit
of
work
four
worth
of
scent
for
the
asking
no
unpleasantness
no
sleight
of
hand
no
nothing
just
a
glad
eye
last
night
and
a
run
this
morning
i
do
wonder
she
was
grateful
we
had
spent
the
afternoon
traversing
san
sebastian
and
had
found
the
place
good
so
good
in
fact
that
it
was
past
six
before
we
returned
to
the
hotel
i
followed
adèle
upstairs
rather
wearily
i
shall
never
get
over
this
morning
i
said
never
arrived
at
our
door
i
fitted
the
key
to
the
lock
to
think
that
i
stood
there
and
let
you
hand
oh
blast
we
left
the
scent
in
the
car
so
we
have
said
adèle
what
an
awful
nuisance
i
knew
we
should
it
fatal
to
put
anything
in
that
hood
you
do
see
it
i
pushed
open
the
door
as
soon
as
i
changed
i
said
switching
on
the
light
i
go
and
the
sentence
was
never
finished
had
i
been
told
that
a
cyclone
had
struck
our
bedroom
i
should
not
have
been
surprised
adèle
and
i
stood
staring
at
such
a
state
of
disorder
as
i
had
never
dreamed
of
the
bed
had
been
dragged
from
the
wall
and
its
clothes
distributed
about
the
room
the
wardrobe
and
cupboards
stood
open
every
drawer
in
the
room
was
on
the
floor
our
clothing
had
been
flung
like
soiled
linen
into
corners
my
wife
had
been
forced
and
now
lay
open
face
downward
upon
the
carpet
while
its
contents
sprawled
upon
a
mattress
a
chair
had
fallen
backwards
into
the
empty
and
the
edge
of
a
sheet
had
caught
on
one
of
its
upturned
legs
adèle
boy
the
swish
of
a
skirt
and
there
was
my
sister
behind
us
our
room
been
good
heavens
yours
is
the
same
the
meaning
of
it
within
three
minutes
two
managers
and
three
clerks
were
on
the
scene
to
do
them
justice
they
were
genuinely
perturbed
fresh
rooms
a
magnificent
suite
were
put
at
our
disposal
under
our
own
eyes
our
belongings
were
gathered
into
sheets
and
carried
to
our
new
quarters
maids
were
summoned
and
placed
at
the
girls
service
valets
were
sent
for
the
was
sent
to
be
repaired
we
were
begged
at
our
convenience
to
report
whether
there
were
any
valuables
we
could
not
find
and
over
and
over
again
we
were
assured
that
the
management
would
not
rest
until
the
thieves
were
taken
jointly
and
severally
we
were
offered
profound
apologies
for
so
abominable
an
outrage
berry
and
jonah
who
had
been
taking
the
cars
to
the
garage
arrived
in
the
midst
of
the
removal
upon
the
circumstances
being
laid
before
my
he
seemed
for
some
time
to
be
deprived
of
the
power
of
speech
and
it
was
only
upon
being
shown
the
contents
of
a
sheet
which
had
just
been
conveyed
by
two
valets
into
his
wife
bedroom
that
he
at
last
gave
tongue
drawing
a
pair
of
dress
trousers
from
beneath
a
bath
towel
a
pair
of
brogues
and
a
box
of
chocolates
he
sobbed
aloud
you
all
he
said
brokenly
do
know
these
trousers
i
remember
the
first
time
ever
i
did
put
them
on
was
on
a
summer
evening
in
the
park
with
one
accord
and
some
asperity
my
sister
and
i
requested
him
to
desist
all
right
he
said
but
why
worry
i
know
there
nothing
valuable
gone
because
in
that
case
i
should
have
been
told
long
ago
been
shocked
and
inconvenienced
of
course
but
to
balance
it
got
a
topping
suite
a
private
thrown
in
and
a
whole
fleet
of
in
attendance
all
stamping
to
wash
and
iron
and
brush
our
clothes
as
they
never
been
brushed
before
and
jill
rooms
all
right
yes
well
let
them
move
along
any
way
then
we
shall
all
be
together
and
now
if
we
got
any
sense
we
shall
let
this
sympathetic
crowd
straighten
up
everything
they
simply
bursting
for
the
word
and
gather
round
the
fire
which
i
see
they
lighted
and
talk
about
something
else
this
was
sound
advice
a
close
acquaintance
with
crime
the
feeling
that
a
robber
has
handled
her
personal
effects
mauled
her
apparel
trodden
her
own
sanctuary
is
bound
to
jangle
a
sensitive
woman
nerves
the
less
the
girls
thought
upon
the
matter
the
better
for
them
orders
were
given
a
sofa
was
drawn
towards
the
hearth
jonah
went
to
seek
some
champagne
and
i
slipped
on
a
coat
and
left
the
hotel
for
the
garage
when
i
returned
some
twenty
minutes
later
adèle
had
discovered
a
piano
and
was
playing
whispering
while
the
others
were
dancing
with
as
much
freedom
from
care
as
they
might
have
displayed
at
a
when
i
laid
the
scent
on
the
table
the
dance
died
and
daphne
adèle
and
jill
crowded
about
me
one
for
each
of
you
i
said
with
my
love
but
wait
one
moment
i
turned
to
adèle
how
did
you
tell
the
violets
from
the
others
it
paper
had
a
line
i
pointed
to
the
three
parcels
so
have
they
all
i
said
it
depends
on
the
way
the
light
strikes
it
one
moment
you
see
it
and
the
next
you
ca
my
wife
examined
the
packages
in
turn
you
perfectly
right
she
said
then
good
heavens
she
cried
perhaps
i
gave
that
woman
the
wrong
one
after
all
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
i
do
suppose
she
cared
what
in
a
name
they
each
of
them
worth
four
pounds
that
true
said
adèle
musingly
still
we
opened
them
one
by
one
the
first
was
the
black
lily
then
came
the
grey
jasmine
i
ripped
the
paper
off
the
third
case
and
laid
it
upon
the
table
with
my
fingers
about
the
cardboard
i
paused
and
what
said
i
is
the
betting
blue
rose
cried
jill
red
violets
said
adèle
i
opened
the
case
they
were
both
wrong
the
tray
contained
no
perfume
at
all
crammed
into
the
form
of
a
was
a
dirty
huddle
of
i
lifted
it
out
between
my
finger
and
thumb
the
diamond
and
emerald
necklace
which
lay
beneath
must
have
been
worth
a
quarter
of
a
million
yes
said
the
british
some
two
hours
later
this
little
seaside
town
is
a
sort
of
thieves
parlour
of
the
stuff
that
stolen
in
spain
goes
out
of
the
country
this
way
as
in
the
present
case
the
actual
thief
dare
try
to
cross
the
frontier
but
he
always
got
an
accomplice
waiting
at
san
sebastian
we
know
the
thieves
all
right
at
least
the
police
do
but
the
accomplices
are
the
devil
often
enough
they
go
no
further
than
biarritz
and
there
are
so
many
of
the
smart
set
constantly
floating
between
the
two
towns
that
they
frightfully
hard
to
spot
in
fact
about
the
only
chance
is
to
trace
their
connection
with
the
thief
what
i
mean
is
this
a
got
the
jewels
and
he
got
to
pass
them
to
b
that
necessitates
some
kind
of
common
denominator
either
they
got
to
meet
or
they
got
to
visit
at
different
times
of
course
the
same
bureau
well
there
you
are
by
the
merest
accident
you
stumbled
upon
the
actual
communication
of
the
password
by
a
to
b
the
voice
you
heard
upon
the
telephone
was
that
of
the
original
thief
or
of
his
representative
this
morning
you
visited
the
actual
bureau
i
know
the
place
well
my
wife
bought
scent
there
it
always
been
a
bit
of
a
mystery
but
i
never
suspected
this
i
not
the
slightest
doubt
it
been
used
as
a
bureau
for
years
well
in
all
innocence
you
gave
the
password
and
in
all
innocence
received
the
gems
b
arrives
too
late
finds
that
you
have
them
and
starts
in
pursuit
i
no
doubt
she
really
ran
on
to
see
which
way
you
gone
she
could
have
hoped
to
catch
you
on
foot
of
course
she
could
understand
how
you
come
by
the
password
but
the
few
words
you
had
with
her
the
night
before
made
her
suspect
your
innocence
still
she
was
sure
and
that
why
her
chauffeur
fetched
up
across
your
bows
you
do
mean
i
do
indeed
if
you
had
handed
them
over
they
have
been
taken
by
force
well
finding
that
either
by
accident
or
design
she
been
sold
a
pup
b
communicates
with
the
gang
and
while
you
out
your
rooms
are
ransacked
and
i
walked
i
said
after
dark
from
the
calle
de
miracruz
to
this
hotel
with
the
baubles
under
my
arm
the
laughed
the
armour
of
ignorance
he
said
will
sometimes
turn
the
keenest
wits
the
confidence
it
gives
its
wearer
is
proverbial
but
why
said
adèle
was
the
so
terribly
nervous
i
mean
if
she
used
to
this
sort
of
traffic
the
fingered
his
chin
then
he
picked
up
the
jewels
perhaps
he
said
slowly
perhaps
she
knew
where
they
came
from
where
was
that
said
daphne
the
frowned
when
i
last
saw
them
he
said
they
were
in
the
royal
treasury
at
ten
the
next
morning
i
was
walking
upon
the
golf
links
of
i
was
not
there
of
choice
two
very
eminent
detectives
one
french
and
one
spanish
were
upon
either
side
of
me
we
were
close
to
the
seventh
green
when
the
frenchman
touched
me
upon
the
arm
look
sir
he
said
pointing
there
is
a
golf
party
coming
they
are
making
no
doubt
for
this
spot
when
they
arrive
pray
approach
and
look
at
them
if
you
should
recognise
anyone
i
beg
that
you
will
take
off
your
hat
he
bowed
and
a
moment
later
i
was
alone
i
sat
down
on
the
turf
and
took
out
a
cigarette
with
a
plop
a
golf
ball
alighted
upon
the
green
trickled
a
few
feet
and
stopped
a
yard
from
the
hole
presently
another
followed
it
rolled
across
the
turf
and
struggled
into
the
rough
i
got
upon
my
feet
and
strolled
towards
the
green
it
was
a
mixed
foursome
in
a
jumper
and
a
white
skirt
eulalie
looked
prettier
than
ever
she
saw
me
at
once
of
course
but
she
took
no
notice
her
companions
glanced
at
me
curiously
putter
in
hand
eulalie
walked
to
her
ball
the
far
one
and
turned
her
back
to
me
after
a
little
consideration
she
holed
out
it
was
a
match
shot
and
her
companions
applauded
vigorously
eulalie
just
smiled
i
always
better
she
said
when
i
something
at
stake
and
what
said
her
partner
a
large
englishman
with
a
grey
moustache
have
you
got
at
stake
this
time
eulalie
laughed
mischievously
if
i
told
you
she
said
you
would
believe
me
enough
they
passed
to
the
eighth
tee
i
watched
them
go
thoughtfully
when
the
detectives
came
up
i
did
take
off
my
hat
i
explained
because
i
was
sure
but
i
almost
certain
that
somewhere
before
i
seen
that
great
big
fellow
with
the
grey
moustache
my
companions
were
not
interested
chapter
ix
how
jonah
took
off
his
coat
and
berry
flirted
with
fortune
for
all
he
was
worth
my
dear
said
berry
be
reasonable
with
pleasure
said
daphne
but
i
not
going
to
let
you
off
her
husband
frowned
upon
a
roll
when
i
say
he
said
that
i
have
a
feeling
that
my
luck
is
in
i
not
being
funny
only
once
before
have
i
had
that
conviction
i
was
at
cannes
at
the
time
on
the
point
of
leaving
for
paris
i
went
to
monte
carlo
instead
that
night
i
picked
up
over
six
hundred
pounds
i
know
said
his
wife
you
often
told
me
but
i
ca
help
it
i
made
you
give
me
your
word
before
we
came
here
and
i
not
going
to
let
you
off
i
gave
it
without
thinking
declared
her
husband
besides
i
never
dreamed
i
should
have
this
feeling
i
did
said
daphne
shortly
that
why
i
made
you
promise
have
some
more
coffee
pointedly
ignoring
the
invitation
berry
returned
to
his
roll
and
after
eyeing
it
with
disgust
which
the
bread
in
no
way
deserved
proceeded
to
disrupt
and
eviscerate
it
with
every
circumstance
of
barbarity
covertly
jonah
and
i
exchanged
smiles
hours
had
elapsed
since
i
had
cut
eulalie
and
this
was
the
morning
of
our
last
day
at
san
sebastian
during
our
short
stay
the
weather
had
been
superb
and
we
had
been
out
and
about
the
whole
day
long
of
an
evening
save
for
one
memorable
exception
we
had
been
to
the
casino
for
as
long
as
i
could
remember
berry
had
had
a
weakness
for
roulette
for
baccarat
and
the
rest
he
cared
nothing
fifty
pounds
a
year
would
have
covered
his
racing
bets
if
he
played
bridge
it
was
by
request
my
was
no
gambler
there
was
something
however
about
the
shining
wheel
sunk
in
its
board
of
green
cloth
which
he
found
irresistible
remembering
this
fascination
my
sister
had
broached
the
matter
so
soon
as
we
had
decided
to
visit
san
sebastian
with
the
happy
result
that
ere
we
left
pau
her
husband
had
promised
her
three
things
the
first
was
to
leave
his
at
home
the
second
to
take
with
him
no
more
than
two
hundred
pounds
the
third
to
send
for
no
more
money
and
now
the
inevitable
had
happened
the
two
hundred
pounds
were
gone
every
penny
we
were
not
due
to
leave
until
the
morrow
and
berry
was
perfectly
satisfied
that
his
luck
had
changed
as
for
the
promises
his
wife
had
extracted
he
was
repenting
his
rashness
as
heartily
as
she
was
commending
her
prevision
nothing
said
berry
turning
again
to
the
charge
was
said
about
borrowing
was
it
no
very
well
then
boy
and
jonah
have
to
lend
me
something
i
not
going
to
let
a
chance
like
this
go
sorry
old
chap
said
jonah
but
we
got
to
pay
the
hotel
bill
thanks
to
your
activities
we
landed
with
how
much
have
you
got
demanded
berry
i
cut
in
and
threw
the
cards
on
the
table
brother
i
said
we
love
you
for
that
reason
alone
we
wo
lend
you
a
paper
franc
but
then
you
knew
that
before
you
asked
us
my
groaned
i
tell
you
he
affirmed
you
throwing
away
money
with
another
two
hundred
and
fifty
i
could
do
anything
i
can
feel
it
in
my
bones
you
lose
the
lot
said
jonah
besides
you
eaten
your
cake
if
you
limited
yourself
last
night
and
played
rationally
instead
of
buttering
the
board
i
sure
said
jill
you
ought
to
have
played
on
a
system
if
put
a
pound
on
and
kept
on
doubling
each
time
you
lost
yes
said
berry
that
an
exhilarating
stunt
that
is
before
you
know
where
you
are
you
got
to
put
two
hundred
and
pounds
on
an
even
chance
to
get
one
back
with
a
limit
of
four
hundred
and
eighty
staring
you
in
the
face
that
takes
a
shade
more
nerve
than
i
can
produce
i
did
try
it
once
at
madeira
luck
was
with
me
after
three
hours
i
made
four
shillings
and
lost
half
a
stone
incidentally
when
a
man
starts
playing
roulette
on
a
system
it
time
to
pray
for
his
soul
i
admit
there
are
hundreds
who
do
it
hundreds
of
intelligent
educated
thoughtful
men
and
women
well
you
can
pray
for
the
lot
they
trying
to
read
something
which
is
written
they
studying
a
blank
page
they
splitting
their
brains
over
a
matter
on
which
an
idiot
advice
would
be
as
valuable
i
knew
a
brilliant
commercial
lawyer
who
used
to
sit
down
at
the
table
and
solemnly
write
down
every
number
that
turned
up
for
one
hour
for
the
next
sixty
minutes
he
planked
still
more
solemnly
on
the
ones
that
had
turned
up
least
often
conceive
such
a
frame
of
mind
that
wonderful
brain
had
failed
to
grasp
the
one
simple
glaring
point
of
which
his
case
consisted
that
roulette
is
lawless
he
failed
to
appreciate
that
he
was
up
against
fortune
herself
he
could
realise
that
because
had
turned
up
seven
times
running
at
a
quarter
past
nine
that
was
no
earthly
reason
why
should
turn
up
eight
times
running
at
a
quarter
past
ten
heaven
knows
what
fun
he
got
out
of
it
for
me
the
whole
joy
of
the
thing
is
that
you
flirting
with
fate
he
closed
his
eyes
suddenly
and
flung
back
his
head
oh
he
breathed
i
tell
you
she
going
to
smile
i
can
see
the
light
in
her
eyes
i
have
a
feeling
that
she
going
to
be
very
kind
very
kind
somehow
we
let
him
linger
over
the
fond
reflection
eyeing
one
another
uneasily
it
was
we
felt
but
the
prelude
to
a
more
formidable
attack
we
were
right
i
demand
barked
berry
that
i
be
allowed
the
wherewithal
to
prosecute
my
suit
not
a
farthing
said
daphne
to
think
that
that
two
hundred
pounds
is
gone
makes
me
feel
that
exactly
why
i
want
to
win
it
back
and
more
also
he
looked
round
desperately
anybody
want
a
birthright
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
quid
i
change
my
name
it
sounds
idiotic
i
know
said
i
but
supposing
supposing
you
lost
i
sha
said
berry
sure
positive
i
tell
you
i
feel
and
you
said
jonah
scornfully
you
have
the
temerity
to
talk
about
praying
for
others
souls
you
sit
there
and
i
tell
you
insisted
berry
that
i
have
a
premonition
look
here
if
i
do
have
a
dart
i
shall
never
be
the
same
man
again
boy
i
implore
you
i
shook
my
head
nothing
doing
i
said
you
thank
us
one
day
you
do
understand
wailed
berry
you
never
known
the
feeling
that
you
were
bound
to
win
yes
i
have
often
and
it
invariably
proved
a
most
expensive
sensation
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
right
said
my
you
one
and
all
determined
to
see
me
go
down
you
watched
me
drop
two
hundred
and
not
one
of
going
to
give
me
a
hand
to
help
me
pick
it
up
it
may
be
but
it
hardly
cordial
some
people
might
call
it
churlish
upon
my
soul
you
are
a
crowd
have
you
ever
known
a
deal
i
would
come
in
on
and
now
because
you
are
virtuous
i
to
lose
my
fun
ugh
hymn
number
four
hundred
and
cakes
and
ale
are
over
struggling
with
laughter
adèle
left
her
seat
and
coming
quickly
behind
him
set
her
white
hands
upon
his
shoulders
dear
old
chap
she
said
laying
her
cheek
against
his
look
at
it
this
way
you
begging
and
praying
us
to
let
you
down
yes
you
are
and
if
we
helped
you
to
break
your
word
neither
you
nor
we
would
ever
at
the
bottom
of
our
hearts
think
quite
so
much
of
us
again
and
that
not
good
enough
even
if
you
won
five
thousand
pounds
it
would
compensate
respect
and
are
things
you
can
buy
but
sweetheart
objected
berry
nothing
was
said
about
borrowing
daphne
admits
it
if
i
can
raise
some
money
without
reference
to
my
bankers
i
at
liberty
to
do
so
certainly
said
adèle
but
we
must
help
if
that
was
allowed
it
knock
the
bottom
out
of
your
promise
you
and
daphne
and
we
are
all
in
the
same
stable
and
that
to
mix
metaphors
puts
us
out
of
court
if
you
ran
into
a
fellow
you
knew
and
he
would
lend
you
some
money
or
you
found
a
hundred
in
the
street
or
a
letter
for
you
arrived
or
one
of
the
died
leaving
me
sole
legatee
i
see
then
i
should
be
within
my
rights
in
fact
if
anything
which
happen
came
to
pass
no
one
would
raise
any
objection
to
my
taking
advantage
of
it
you
know
you
getting
too
generous
that
better
said
adèle
a
moment
ago
we
were
berry
winced
i
take
it
back
he
said
humbly
your
central
heating
arrangements
at
any
rate
are
in
perfect
order
unless
your
heart
was
glowing
your
soft
little
cheek
would
be
half
so
warm
i
do
know
about
that
said
adèle
straightening
her
back
but
we
try
to
be
sporting
and
that
your
fault
she
added
you
taught
us
the
applause
which
greeted
this
remark
was
interrupted
by
the
entry
of
a
waiter
bearing
some
letters
which
had
been
forwarded
from
pau
a
registered
package
for
which
berry
was
requested
to
sign
set
us
all
thinking
whatever
is
it
said
daphne
i
ca
imagine
replied
her
husband
scrutinising
the
postmark
i
ordered
nothing
from
paris
that
i
can
remember
open
it
quick
said
jonah
perhaps
it
some
wherewithal
berry
hacked
at
the
string
the
next
instant
he
leaped
to
his
feet
fate
he
shrieked
fate
i
told
you
my
luck
was
in
he
turned
to
his
wife
breathlessly
those
premium
bonds
you
wanted
me
to
go
in
for
over
a
month
ago
i
applied
for
i
forgotten
about
the
trash
and
they
two
hours
and
a
half
had
gone
by
and
we
were
rounding
a
tremendous
bend
on
the
way
to
zarauz
when
my
wife
touched
berry
upon
the
arm
are
you
excited
she
said
just
a
trifle
he
answered
but
i
trying
to
tread
it
under
essential
that
i
should
keep
cool
when
you
arm
in
arm
with
fortune
you
apt
to
lose
your
head
and
then
you
done
the
jade
give
me
my
cues
i
sure
of
it
but
she
wo
shout
them
i
got
to
keep
my
eyes
skinned
and
my
ears
pricked
if
i
going
to
pick
them
up
if
i
said
adèle
were
in
your
shoes
i
should
be
just
gibbering
it
was
indeed
a
queer
business
the
dramatic
appearance
of
the
funds
had
startled
us
all
had
they
arrived
earlier
had
they
come
in
the
shape
of
something
less
easily
negotiable
than
bearer
bonds
had
they
been
representing
more
or
less
than
precisely
the
very
sum
which
berry
had
named
in
his
appeal
we
might
have
labelled
the
matter
coincidence
and
thought
no
more
of
it
such
a
label
however
refused
to
stick
the
affair
ranked
with
thunder
out
of
a
cloudless
sky
as
for
my
sister
with
the
wind
taken
out
of
her
sails
she
had
hauled
down
her
flag
the
thing
was
too
hard
for
her
it
was
jonah
who
had
sprung
a
mine
in
the
midst
of
our
amazement
stop
he
had
cried
where
yesterday
paper
those
things
are
premium
bonds
and
unless
i
utterly
mistaken
there
was
a
drawing
two
days
ago
one
of
those
little
fellows
may
be
worth
a
thousand
pounds
the
paper
had
confirmed
his
report
the
thought
that
but
for
his
wit
we
might
have
released
such
substance
to
clutch
at
such
a
shadow
had
set
us
all
twittering
more
than
ever
at
once
a
council
had
been
held
finally
it
had
been
decided
to
visit
a
bank
and
before
we
disposed
of
the
bonds
to
ask
for
and
search
the
official
bulletin
in
which
are
published
the
results
of
all
government
lottery
draws
inquiry
however
had
revealed
that
the
day
was
some
sort
of
a
holiday
and
that
no
banks
would
be
open
at
last
a
financier
was
unearthed
a
changer
of
money
in
execrable
french
he
had
put
himself
at
our
service
he
had
the
bulletin
it
had
arrived
this
morning
feverishly
we
searched
its
pages
once
we
had
found
the
column
a
glance
was
enough
our
bonds
bore
consecutive
numbers
of
which
the
first
figure
was
o
the
series
appeared
to
be
unfortunate
the
winning
list
contained
not
a
single
representative
more
reassured
than
disappointed
we
raised
the
question
of
a
loan
our
gentleman
picked
at
the
bonds
and
wrinkled
his
nose
after
a
little
he
offered
one
hundred
pounds
this
was
absurd
and
we
said
so
the
bonds
were
worth
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
were
as
good
as
hard
cash
the
fellow
had
no
office
and
when
we
wanted
him
again
as
like
as
not
he
would
have
disappeared
his
personal
appearance
was
against
him
when
we
protested
his
answer
came
pat
was
no
in
the
last
ten
years
he
had
not
advanced
ten
pesetas
he
was
a
changer
of
money
a
broker
and
nothing
else
finally
he
offered
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
at
sixty
per
cent
a
year
part
of
a
for
one
so
ignorant
of
usury
this
was
not
bad
we
thanked
him
acidly
offered
the
bonds
for
sale
and
after
a
little
calculation
accepted
two
hundred
and
pounds
in
spanish
notes
half
an
hour
later
we
had
climbed
into
the
cars
anxious
to
make
the
most
of
our
last
day
in
spain
if
the
way
to
zarauz
was
handsome
that
from
zarauz
to
zumaya
was
fit
for
a
king
take
us
a
range
of
mountains
bold
rugged
precipitous
and
bring
the
sea
to
their
foot
no
ordinary
sea
sirs
but
ocean
himself
the
terrible
atlantic
to
wit
in
all
his
glory
and
there
upon
the
boundary
itself
where
his
proud
waves
are
stayed
build
us
a
road
a
curling
shelf
of
a
road
to
follow
the
line
of
that
most
notable
indenture
witnessing
the
covenant
land
and
sea
settled
when
time
was
born
above
us
the
ramparts
of
spain
below
an
echelon
of
rollers
ceaselessly
surging
to
their
doom
before
us
a
ragged
wonder
of
rising
and
falling
and
thrusting
into
the
distance
till
the
snarling
leagues
shrank
into
murmuring
inches
and
tumult
dwindled
into
rest
on
our
right
the
might
majesty
dominion
and
power
of
ocean
a
limitless
laughing
mystery
of
running
white
and
blue
shining
and
swaying
and
swelling
till
the
eye
faltered
before
so
much
magnificence
and
sky
let
fall
her
curtain
to
spare
the
failing
sight
for
over
six
miles
we
hung
over
the
edge
of
europe
little
wonder
that
we
sailed
into
zumaya
all
red
roofs
white
walls
and
timbers
with
full
hearts
flushed
and
exulting
the
twenty
precious
minutes
which
had
just
gone
by
were
charged
with
the
spirit
of
the
odyssey
arrived
at
the
village
we
stopped
to
wait
for
the
others
so
soon
as
they
came
we
passed
on
slowly
along
the
road
to
deva
perhaps
a
mile
from
zumaya
we
ate
our
lunch
the
comfortable
hush
which
should
succeed
a
hearty
meal
made
in
the
open
air
upon
a
summer
day
was
well
established
daphne
and
adèle
were
murmuring
conversation
in
a
low
voice
jill
was
addressing
berry
and
thinking
of
piers
pipe
in
mouth
jonah
was
blinking
into
a
pair
of
and
i
was
lying
flat
upon
my
back
neither
smoking
nor
sleeping
but
gradually
losing
consciousness
with
a
cigarette
in
my
hand
i
had
come
to
the
point
of
postponing
through
sheer
lethargy
the
onerous
duty
of
lifting
the
cigarette
to
my
lips
when
with
an
oath
that
ripped
the
air
jonah
started
to
his
feet
sleep
went
flying
i
sat
up
amazedly
propping
myself
on
my
hands
with
dropped
jaw
my
cousin
was
staring
through
the
glasses
as
a
man
who
is
looking
upon
sudden
death
while
i
watched
he
lowered
them
peered
into
the
distance
clapped
them
again
to
his
eyes
let
them
fall
glanced
swiftly
to
right
and
left
shut
his
mouth
with
a
snap
and
made
a
dash
for
the
cars
with
his
hand
upon
ping
door
he
turned
and
pointed
a
trembling
forefinger
along
the
valley
there
zed
he
cried
my
horse
have
seen
him
since
cambrai
leading
a
team
and
they
flogging
him
i
fancy
he
knew
i
should
join
him
for
he
never
closed
ping
door
as
he
changed
into
second
i
swung
myself
inboard
a
moment
later
we
were
flying
along
the
dusty
road
zed
had
been
jonah
charger
for
over
three
years
together
for
month
after
month
the
two
had
endured
the
rough
and
revelled
in
the
smooth
they
had
shared
misery
and
they
had
shared
ease
together
many
times
they
had
passed
through
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
and
while
the
animal
must
have
loved
jonah
my
cousin
was
devoted
to
the
horse
at
last
came
cambrai
jonah
was
shot
through
the
knee
and
sent
to
england
and
zed
poor
zed
disappeared
my
cousin
efforts
to
trace
him
were
superhuman
unhappily
his
groom
had
been
killed
when
jonah
was
wounded
and
though
all
manner
of
authorities
from
the
director
of
remounts
downwards
had
lent
their
official
aid
though
a
most
particular
description
had
been
circulated
and
special
instructions
issued
to
all
the
depots
through
which
the
horse
might
pass
to
his
lasting
grief
jonah
had
never
heard
of
zed
again
and
now
i
found
myself
praying
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
jonah
was
driving
like
a
man
possessed
we
tore
up
a
rise
whipped
round
a
bend
and
coming
suddenly
upon
a
road
on
our
right
passed
it
with
locked
wheels
the
noise
my
cousin
made
as
he
changed
into
reverse
showed
that
his
love
for
zed
was
overwhelming
we
shot
backward
stopped
stormed
to
the
right
and
streaked
up
a
shocking
road
at
we
flashed
into
a
hamlet
turned
at
right
angles
missed
a
waggon
by
an
inch
and
flung
up
a
frightful
track
towards
a
farm
then
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
we
had
stopped
dead
and
door
was
open
and
he
was
limping
across
the
road
in
the
jaws
of
a
rude
gateway
stood
a
waggon
of
stones
harnessed
to
this
were
three
mules
and
leading
them
the
piteous
wreck
of
what
had
been
a
blue
roan
the
latter
was
down
and
out
for
this
the
immediate
reason
was
plain
the
teamster
better
qualified
for
the
treadmill
had
so
steered
his
waggon
that
the
hub
of
its
off
fore
wheel
had
met
the
gatepost
this
he
had
not
observed
but
a
firm
believer
in
the
omnipotency
of
the
lash
had
determined
to
reduce
the
check
whatever
might
be
its
cause
by
methods
of
blood
and
iron
either
because
he
was
the
most
convenient
or
by
virtue
of
his
status
the
leader
had
received
the
brunt
of
the
attack
that
is
of
course
one
way
of
driving
the
blue
roan
was
down
and
his
master
had
just
kicked
him
in
the
belly
when
jonah
arrived
the
spaniard
was
a
big
fellow
but
my
cousin
has
wrists
of
steel
he
took
the
whip
from
its
owner
as
one
takes
a
toy
from
a
baby
then
with
the
butt
he
hit
him
across
the
mouth
the
spaniard
reeled
caught
his
foot
on
a
stone
and
fell
heavily
jonah
threw
down
the
whip
and
took
off
his
coat
i
do
want
to
kill
him
he
said
quietly
when
the
other
rose
he
looked
extremely
ugly
this
was
largely
due
to
the
fact
that
most
of
his
front
teeth
were
missing
and
that
it
was
difficult
because
of
the
blood
to
see
exactly
where
his
face
ended
and
his
mouth
began
the
look
in
his
eyes
however
was
suggesting
the
intent
to
kill
he
had
no
idea
of
course
that
he
was
facing
perhaps
the
one
man
living
who
could
have
thrashed
a
champion
it
is
not
often
that
you
will
see
half
a
dozen
of
the
most
illustrious
members
of
the
national
sporting
club
attending
an
held
at
a
public
school
three
years
running
i
had
that
honour
the
gentlemen
came
to
see
jonah
and
though
no
applause
was
allowed
during
the
boxing
they
always
broke
the
rule
in
due
season
my
cousin
went
to
oxford
in
his
second
year
in
the
contest
he
knocked
his
opponent
out
in
seven
seconds
the
latter
remained
unconscious
for
more
than
six
hours
each
crawling
one
of
which
took
a
year
off
jonah
life
from
that
day
my
cousin
never
put
on
the
gloves
again
all
however
that
the
spaniard
saw
was
a
tall
man
with
a
game
leg
who
by
his
gross
interference
had
taken
him
by
surprise
he
lowered
his
head
and
actually
ran
upon
his
fate
i
have
never
seen
punishment
at
once
so
frightful
and
so
punctiliously
administered
jonah
worked
with
the
swift
precision
of
the
surgeon
about
the
operating
table
he
confessed
afterwards
that
his
chief
concern
was
to
keep
his
opponent
too
blind
with
rage
to
see
the
wisdom
of
capitulation
he
need
not
have
worried
when
it
had
become
obvious
that
the
blessed
gifts
of
sight
smell
and
hearing
had
been
almost
wholly
withdrawn
from
the
gentleman
when
in
fact
he
had
practically
ceased
attempting
to
defend
himself
and
merely
bellowed
with
mortification
at
every
stinging
blow
jonah
knocked
him
sprawling
on
to
the
midden
and
drew
off
his
gloves
the
next
moment
he
was
down
on
his
knees
beside
the
roan
plucking
at
the
rough
harness
with
trembling
fingers
once
the
horse
sought
to
rise
but
at
jonah
word
he
stopped
and
laid
down
his
head
between
us
we
got
him
clear
then
we
stood
back
and
jonah
called
him
with
a
piteous
effort
the
roan
got
upon
his
legs
that
there
was
back
trouble
and
at
least
one
hock
was
sprung
i
saw
at
a
glance
the
horse
had
been
broken
down
he
was
still
blowing
badly
and
i
ran
for
the
flask
in
the
car
when
i
came
back
jonah
was
caressing
his
charger
with
tears
running
down
his
cheeks
there
is
a
listlessness
born
of
harsh
treatment
suckled
on
dying
hopes
reared
on
the
bitter
memory
of
happier
days
which
is
more
eloquent
than
tears
there
is
an
air
of
frozen
misery
of
a
despair
so
deep
that
a
kind
word
has
come
to
lose
its
meaning
which
none
but
horses
wear
looking
upon
zed
i
felt
ashamed
to
be
a
man
gaunt
filthy
and
tottering
the
flies
mercilessly
busy
about
three
shocking
sores
the
roan
was
presenting
a
terrible
indictment
to
be
filed
against
the
day
of
judgment
and
not
one
of
them
is
forgotten
before
god
but
there
was
worse
than
pain
of
body
here
the
dull
eyes
the
head
the
mien
told
of
a
tragedy
to
make
the
angels
weep
an
english
thoroughbred
not
dead
but
with
a
broken
heart
we
had
administered
the
brandy
jonah
was
bathing
a
sore
and
i
had
made
a
wisp
and
was
rubbing
zed
down
when
good
day
said
a
voice
with
his
arms
folded
upon
the
sill
a
little
man
was
watching
us
from
a
window
i
looked
up
and
nodded
good
day
i
said
ah
like
boxing
said
the
man
ah
bin
twelve
years
in
the
states
an
ah
rather
see
boxing
than
a
you
like
baseball
i
shook
my
head
i
never
seen
it
i
said
have
missed
much
was
the
reply
but
ah
like
boxing
you
visiting
spain
for
a
few
days
a
fine
country
bin
to
sevilla
entirely
ignoring
the
violence
which
he
had
just
witnessed
to
say
nothing
of
our
trespass
upon
his
property
and
our
continued
attention
to
his
horse
the
farmer
proceeded
to
discuss
the
merits
and
shortcomings
of
spain
with
as
much
detached
composure
as
if
we
had
met
him
in
a
tavern
at
length
jonah
got
up
will
you
sell
me
this
horse
yes
said
the
man
ah
will
what
want
for
him
five
hundred
pesetas
right
said
jonah
have
you
got
a
halter
the
man
disappeared
presently
he
emerged
from
a
door
halter
in
hand
the
twenty
pounds
passed
and
zed
was
ours
tenderly
my
cousin
fitted
the
halter
about
the
drooping
head
one
more
effort
old
chap
he
said
gently
turning
towards
the
gate
out
of
compassion
for
the
mules
i
drew
the
farmer
attention
to
the
hub
which
was
nursing
the
gatepost
he
just
nodded
pedro
could
never
drive
he
said
i
should
get
a
new
carter
i
said
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
he
jerked
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
carcase
upon
the
midden
he
is
my
we
do
not
speak
he
said
simply
we
found
the
others
in
the
hamlet
through
which
we
had
passed
there
i
handed
over
ping
to
adèle
and
thence
jonah
and
zed
and
i
walked
to
zumaya
to
find
a
box
at
the
station
was
more
than
we
had
dared
hope
for
but
there
it
was
empty
and
waiting
to
be
returned
to
san
sebastian
beneath
the
influence
of
pesetas
the
saw
no
good
reason
why
it
should
not
be
returned
by
the
evening
train
we
left
jonah
to
accompany
his
horse
and
hurried
home
by
car
to
seek
a
stable
when
we
sat
down
to
dinner
that
night
at
eight
jonah
called
for
the
and
ordered
a
magnum
of
champagne
when
the
wine
was
poured
he
raised
his
glass
and
looked
at
me
thank
you
for
helping
me
he
said
he
glanced
round
with
his
eyes
glowing
and
all
of
you
for
being
so
glad
he
drank
and
touched
adèle
upon
the
shoulder
in
a
up
to
his
knees
in
straw
with
an
armful
of
hay
to
pick
over
and
no
congestion
have
you
ever
felt
you
wanted
to
get
up
and
dance
he
turned
to
berry
brother
your
best
may
you
spot
the
winner
as
i
did
this
afternoon
thank
you
said
berry
thank
you
i
must
confess
i
been
hoping
for
some
sort
of
intuition
as
to
what
to
do
but
i
not
had
a
hint
so
far
perhaps
when
i
get
to
the
table
it
silly
of
course
one
must
expect
too
much
but
i
had
the
feeling
that
i
was
going
to
be
given
a
tip
you
know
like
striking
a
dud
egg
and
then
putting
your
shirt
on
a
horse
called
of
roses
never
mind
talk
about
something
else
why
did
you
call
him
short
for
said
jonah
i
think
my
groom
started
it
and
i
zero
said
berry
quietly
i
much
obliged
it
was
a
quarter
to
eleven
and
berry
had
lost
one
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
across
her
husband
back
daphne
threw
me
a
despairing
glance
upon
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
adèle
and
jill
one
upon
either
side
of
jonah
stared
miserably
before
them
i
lighted
my
tenth
cigarette
and
wondered
what
berry
had
done
the
table
was
crowded
from
their
points
of
vantage
the
eight
croupiers
alternately
did
their
business
and
regarded
the
assembly
with
a
bored
air
a
beautifully
dressed
american
who
had
been
losing
observed
the
luck
of
her
neighbour
a
burly
dutchman
with
envious
eyes
with
a
remonstrance
in
every
fingertip
a
debonnaire
frenchman
was
laughingly
upbraiding
his
fellow
for
giving
him
bad
advice
from
above
his
spectacles
an
old
gentleman
in
a
blue
suit
watched
the
remorseless
rake
jerk
his
five
pesetas
into
the
bank
in
evident
annoyance
cheek
by
jowl
with
a
dainty
englishwoman
who
reminded
me
irresistibly
of
a
dresden
shepherdess
a
spanish
jew
who
had
won
was
explosively
disputing
with
a
croupier
the
amount
of
his
stake
two
south
americans
were
leaning
across
the
table
nonchalantly
plastering
the
board
a
little
old
lady
with
an
enormous
bag
was
thanking
an
elegant
spaniard
for
disposing
her
stake
as
she
desired
finger
to
lip
a
tall
spanish
girl
in
a
large
black
hat
was
sizing
her
remaining
counters
with
a
faint
frown
a
very
young
couple
patently
upon
their
honeymoon
were
conferring
excitedly
juego
the
conference
between
the
lovers
became
more
intense
hecho
oh
be
quick
cried
the
girl
between
and
bill
between
as
the
money
went
on
va
cried
the
croupier
in
charge
two
pairs
of
eyes
peered
at
the
revolving
wheel
they
did
not
notice
that
the
dutchman
plunging
at
the
last
moment
upon
had
touched
their
counter
with
his
cuff
and
moved
it
to
the
ball
lost
its
momentum
poppled
across
the
ridges
and
leaped
to
rest
two
faces
fell
i
wondered
if
a
new
frock
had
vanished
into
air
with
the
edge
of
his
rake
a
croupier
was
tapping
their
counter
and
looking
round
for
the
claimant
for
a
second
the
jew
peered
about
him
then
he
pointed
to
himself
and
stretched
out
his
hand
i
called
to
the
croupier
in
french
no
it
belongs
to
monsieur
and
madame
i
saw
what
happened
that
gentleman
moved
it
with
his
cuff
with
a
sickly
leer
the
pretender
rallied
the
croupier
confidentially
assured
the
dainty
englishwoman
that
he
did
not
care
and
laughing
a
little
too
heartily
waved
the
pounds
towards
their
bewildered
owners
it
is
mine
stammered
the
boy
yes
i
said
smiling
your
counter
was
moved
i
saw
the
whole
thing
i
hesitated
then
if
you
take
an
old
hand
advice
you
stop
now
a
thing
like
that
invariably
the
end
of
one
luck
i
was
not
old
hand
and
i
had
no
authority
for
my
dictum
my
interference
was
unpardonable
when
the
two
stopped
to
thank
me
as
they
passed
from
the
room
i
felt
like
a
criminal
still
they
looked
very
charming
and
after
all
a
frock
on
the
back
is
worth
a
score
at
the
dressmaker
i
am
going
said
berry
to
suspend
my
courtship
and
smoke
a
cigarette
possibly
i
going
too
strong
if
i
give
the
lady
a
rest
she
may
think
more
of
me
i
suppose
said
daphne
you
bent
on
losing
it
all
her
husband
frowned
fortune
favours
the
bold
he
said
shortly
you
see
she
just
proving
me
if
i
were
to
falter
she
turn
me
down
it
was
impossible
not
to
admire
such
confidence
i
bade
my
sister
take
heart
much
i
concluded
may
be
done
with
forty
pounds
fifty
corrected
berry
and
now
let
change
the
subject
how
pronounce
lwow
or
would
you
rather
tell
me
a
fairy
tale
i
shook
my
head
my
power
i
said
of
concentration
is
limited
then
i
must
said
berry
it
fatal
to
brood
over
your
fortune
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
and
let
the
smoke
make
its
own
way
out
of
his
mouth
there
was
once
a
large
king
it
was
his
fault
the
girth
went
with
the
crown
all
the
koppabottemburgs
were
enormous
besides
it
went
very
well
with
his
subjects
looking
upon
him
they
felt
they
were
getting
their
money
worth
a
man
of
simple
tastes
his
favourite
hobby
was
fowls
one
day
just
as
he
finished
cleaning
out
the
he
found
that
he
run
out
of
maize
so
he
slipped
on
his
invisible
cloak
and
ran
round
to
the
grocer
he
always
wore
his
invisible
cloak
when
shopping
he
found
it
cheaper
well
the
grocer
was
just
recovering
from
the
spectacle
of
two
pounds
of
the
best
maize
shoving
themselves
into
a
bag
and
pushing
off
down
the
high
street
when
a
witch
came
in
the
grocer
heart
sank
into
his
boots
he
hated
witches
if
you
were
civil
before
you
knew
where
you
were
you
were
a
toad
or
a
or
something
so
you
had
to
be
civil
as
for
their
custom
well
it
was
worth
having
they
would
look
at
bacon
unless
guarantee
that
the
pig
had
been
killed
on
a
moonless
friday
with
the
wind
in
the
north
and
as
for
pulled
figs
if
you
could
swear
that
the
box
had
been
crossed
by
a
man
whose
father
had
committed
arson
in
a
pair
of
brown
boots
you
could
go
and
bury
them
under
the
lilacs
this
time
however
the
grocer
was
pleasantly
surprised
i
did
know
said
the
witch
that
you
were
under
the
patronage
of
royalty
oh
did
you
said
the
grocer
why
the
master
of
the
horse
has
got
his
here
for
nearly
two
days
now
master
of
the
horse
be
snookered
said
the
witch
i
talking
about
the
king
stammered
the
grocer
cut
it
out
said
the
witch
to
whom
an
invisible
cloak
meant
nothing
doubt
you
been
told
to
keep
quiet
but
i
do
count
and
i
bet
you
did
the
old
fool
over
his
maize
the
grocer
brain
worked
very
rapidly
the
memory
of
a
tin
of
mixed
biscuits
and
half
a
dutch
cheese
which
had
floated
out
of
his
shop
only
the
day
before
and
numerous
other
recollections
of
mysteriously
animated
provisions
came
swarming
into
his
mind
at
length
never
charge
royalty
he
said
loftily
do
you
snapped
the
witch
supposing
you
change
this
broomstick
you
swore
blue
it
was
cut
on
a
rainless
tuesday
from
an
ash
that
had
supported
a
murderer
with
a
false
nose
the
very
first
time
i
used
it
it
broke
at
six
thousand
feet
i
was
over
the
sea
at
the
time
and
had
to
glide
nearly
four
miles
to
make
a
landing
can
you
it
when
the
grocer
put
up
his
shutters
two
hectic
hours
later
he
was
a
weary
man
in
the
interval
he
had
been
respectively
a
toad
a
picture
and
a
tin
of
baked
beans
and
somebody
had
knocked
him
off
the
counter
during
his
third
metamorphosis
so
he
felt
like
death
all
the
same
before
going
to
bed
he
sat
down
and
wrote
to
the
lord
chamberlain
asking
for
permission
to
display
the
royal
arms
just
to
make
it
quite
clear
that
he
was
relying
on
he
added
that
he
was
shortly
expecting
a
fine
consignment
of
maize
and
other
commodities
the
postscript
settled
it
the
permission
was
granted
the
king
elsewhere
in
future
and
the
witch
was
given
three
hours
to
leave
the
kingdom
so
the
grocer
lost
his
two
worst
customers
and
got
the
advertisement
of
his
life
which
goes
to
show
my
children
that
if
only
hullo
here
a
new
shift
it
was
true
the
eight
croupiers
were
going
off
duty
as
they
vacated
their
seats
eight
other
gentlemen
in
black
immediately
replaced
them
berry
extinguished
his
cigarette
and
handed
me
his
last
bunch
of
notes
in
exchange
for
these
with
the
peculiar
delicacy
of
his
kind
the
croupier
upon
my
right
selected
arrayed
and
offered
me
counters
of
the
value
of
forty
english
pounds
he
might
have
been
spared
his
pains
as
i
was
piling
the
money
by
berry
side
announced
a
nasal
voice
we
off
said
my
will
you
see
that
they
pay
me
right
one
hundred
and
pounds
ere
i
had
completed
my
calculation
repeated
the
nasal
voice
i
said
so
said
berry
raising
his
eyebrows
i
had
the
maximum
that
time
will
you
be
so
good
thank
you
trembling
with
excitement
i
started
to
count
the
equivalent
of
four
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
berry
was
addressing
the
croupier
no
do
touch
the
stake
she
not
finished
yet
hecho
do
leave
it
all
begged
daphne
take
vas
desperately
i
started
to
check
the
money
again
there
was
a
long
gasp
of
wonderment
immediately
followed
by
a
buzz
of
exclamation
the
croupiers
were
smiling
jill
was
jumping
up
and
down
in
her
seat
adèle
was
shaking
jonah
by
the
arm
my
sister
was
clinging
to
berry
imploring
him
to
stop
now
the
two
frenchmen
were
laughing
and
nodding
their
congratulations
the
little
old
lady
was
bowing
and
beaming
excepting
perhaps
the
croupiers
berry
seemed
less
concerned
than
anyone
present
no
i
not
going
to
stop
he
said
gently
because
that
would
be
foolish
but
i
give
it
a
miss
this
time
because
it
not
coming
up
it
no
longer
a
question
of
guessing
dear
i
tell
you
i
know
the
ball
went
flying
after
a
moment
interval
eight
announced
the
croupier
you
see
said
berry
i
should
have
lost
my
money
now
this
time
my
old
friend
zero
will
come
along
on
to
the
rectangle
went
fourteen
pounds
a
few
seconds
later
i
was
receiving
four
hundred
and
ninety
i
began
to
feel
dazed
as
for
counting
the
money
it
was
out
of
the
question
idiotically
i
began
to
arrange
the
counters
in
little
piles
turned
up
that
right
said
berry
quietly
and
now
it
really
very
monotonous
but
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
he
set
the
limit
on
i
held
my
breath
the
ball
ceased
to
rattle
began
to
fall
ricochetted
from
stud
to
stud
tumbled
into
the
wheel
nosed
and
fell
with
a
click
into
berry
spread
out
his
hands
i
tell
you
he
said
it
too
easy
and
now
again
do
cried
daphne
do
i
beg
you
my
darling
said
berry
after
no
leave
the
stake
please
i
never
play
again
this
evening
well

money

and
we
may
as
well
have
it
may
we
i
mean
it
is
as
if
i
been
given
the
tip
from
the
moment
i
woke
this
morning
listen
dear
do
bother
about
the
wheel
the
lady
been
hammering
away
you
must
admit
she
done
the
job
thoroughly
first
the
intuition
then
the
wherewithal
then
what
to
back
i
should
be
a
mug
if
i
did
upon
the
explosion
of
excitement
which
greeted
the
astounding
event
patrons
of
the
baccarat
table
and
of
the
other
roulette
wheel
left
their
seats
and
came
crowding
to
see
what
was
toward
complete
strangers
were
chattering
like
old
friends
gibbering
with
emotion
the
spanish
jew
was
dramatically
recounting
what
had
occurred
the
dutchman
was
sitting
back
laughing
boisterously
the
frenchmen
were
waving
and
crying
jonah
was
shouting
as
though
he
had
been
in
the
hunting
field
adèle
and
jill
were
beating
upon
the
table
berry
bowed
his
acknowledgments
as
in
a
dream
i
watched
them
send
for
more
money
when
it
arrived
they
gave
me
four
hundred
and
ninety
pounds
juego
berry
shook
his
head
not
this
time
he
said
quietly
he
was
right
after
a
look
at
the
ball
ran
with
a
click
into
a
long
sigh
of
relief
followed
its
settlement
you
see
said
berry
picking
up
fourteen
pounds
do
i
said
weakly
do
i
ca
bear
it
the
bewitched
if
it
turns
up
again
i
shall
collapse
you
mean
that
said
berry
putting
the
money
on
va
i
do
my
heart
then
say
your
prayers
said
my
for
as
i
live
that
ball
going
to
pick
out
i
never
remember
such
a
scene
everybody
in
the
room
seemed
to
be
shouting
i
know
i
was
respectable
spaniards
stamped
upon
the
floor
like
bulls
the
frenchmen
who
with
berry
and
several
others
had
backed
the
winner
were
clasping
one
another
and
singing
the
marseillaise
the
beautifully
dressed
american
was
wringing
adèle
hand
the
old
gentleman
in
the
blue
suit
was
on
his
feet
and
appeared
to
be
making
a
speech
the
spanish
girl
was
standing
upon
her
chair
waving
a
handkerchief
in
vain
the
smiling
croupiers
appealed
for
order
as
the
tumult
subsided
seven
times
in
ten
spins
said
berry
well
i
think
that
do
we
just
run
up
the
board
on
the
even
chances
there
was
no
holding
him
before
i
knew
where
i
was
he
had
set
twelve
thousand
pesetas
apiece
on
and
some
fourteen
hundred
pounds
on
a
single
spin
i
covered
my
eyes
as
the
ball
began
to
lose
way
the
hush
was
awful
seven
announced
the
spokesman
with
my
brain
whirling
i
sought
to
garner
the
harvest
my
rose
to
his
feet
one
last
throw
he
said
for
poor
he
leaned
forward
and
put
the
maximum
on
a
moment
later
counter
by
counter
four
hundred
and
seventy
pounds
went
into
the
as
i
pushed
back
my
chair
i
glanced
at
my
watch
in
exactly
sixteen
minutes
berry
had
stung
bank
to
the
tune
of
as
near
as
i
could
make
it
four
thousand
nine
hundred
and
pounds
some
ten
hours
later
we
slipped
out
of
san
sebastian
and
on
to
the
famous
road
which
leads
to
biarritz
berry
daphne
and
jill
were
in
one
car
and
adèle
and
i
were
in
the
other
jonah
and
zed
were
to
travel
together
by
train
it
was
improbable
that
they
would
leave
for
pau
before
the
morrow
as
we
climbed
out
of
behobie
we
took
our
last
look
at
spain
that
realm
of
majestic
distances
and
superb
backgrounds
you
may
peer
into
the
face
of
france
and
find
it
lovely
the
more
you
magnify
an
english
landscape
the
richer
it
will
become
but
to
find
the
whole
beauty
of
spain
a
man
must
stand
back
and
lift
up
his
eyes
now
that
we
had
left
it
behind
the
pride
and
grandeur
of
the
scenery
beggared
description
it
was
as
though
for
days
we
had
been
looking
upon
a
mighty
canvas
and
while
we
had
caught
something
of
its
splendour
now
for
the
first
time
had
we
focussed
it
aright
the
memory
we
took
away
was
that
of
a
masterpiece
anxious
to
be
home
in
time
for
luncheon
i
laid
hold
of
the
wheel
we
whipped
through
jean
de
luz
sang
through
bidart
and
hobbled
over
a
fearful
stretch
of
metalling
into
bayonne
as
we
were
nearing
bidache
how
much
said
adèle
suddenly
is
berry
actually
up
allowing
for
everything
said
i
that
is
his
losses
what
he
gave
to
the
poor
and
the
various
rates
of
exchange
about
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
not
so
dusty
said
adèle
thoughtfully
all
the
same
a
report
like
that
of
a
gun
blew
the
sentence
to
blazes
heavily
i
took
the
car
in
to
the
side
of
the
road
a
second
tire
went
upon
the
outskirts
of
pau
happily
we
had
two
spare
wheels
as
i
was
wearily
resuming
my
seat
berry
daphne
and
jill
went
by
with
a
cheer
slowly
we
followed
them
into
the
town
it
was
not
until
we
were
stealing
up
our
own
villa
drive
that
at
length
i
remembered
the
question
which
for
over
an
hour
i
had
been
meaning
to
put
to
my
wife
as
i
brought
the
car
to
a
standstill
what
was
it
i
demanded
that
you
had
begun
to
say
when
we
had
the
first
burst
near
bidache
we
were
talking
about
how
much
berry
was
up
and
you
said
the
most
yell
that
i
have
ever
heard
fell
upon
our
ears
for
a
moment
we
stared
at
one
another
then
we
fell
out
of
the
car
by
opposite
doors
and
flew
up
the
steps
extended
upon
a
chair
in
the
hall
berry
was
bellowing
clawing
at
his
temples
and
drumming
with
his
heels
upon
the
floor
huddled
together
daphne
and
jill
were
poring
over
a
letter
with
starting
eyes
sir
case
the
fact
has
not
already
come
to
your
notice
we
hasten
to
inform
you
that
as
a
result
of
the
drawing
which
took
place
on
monday
last
one
of
the
premium
bonds
which
we
yesterday
dispatched
to
you
per
registered
post
has
won
the
first
prize
of
fr
five
hundred
thousand
francs
way
of
confirmation
we
beg
to
enclose
a
cutting
from
the
official
should
perhaps
point
out
that
in
all
announcements
of
the
results
of
drawings
the
or
which
for
some
reason
invariably
precedes
the
number
of
a
premium
bond
is
the
pleasure
of
your
instructions
beg
to
remain
dear
sir
your
obedient
servants
it
was
perhaps
five
hours
later
that
my
memory
again
responded
and
i
turned
to
adèle
the
dam
burst
said
i
at
the
very
moment
when
you
were
going
to
tell
me
what
you
had
been
about
to
say
when
the
first
tire
went
outside
bidache
sounds
like
house
that
jack
built
does
it
oh
i
know
said
adèle
laughing
but
it
no
good
now
i
was
going
to
say
the
door
opened
and
falcon
came
in
with
a
wire
i
picked
up
the
form
and
weighed
it
thoughtfully
wonderfully
quick
i
said
it
was
two
when
i
was
at
the
bank
and
i
could
have
been
at
the
post
office
before
a
quarter
to
three
i
looked
at
my
watch
just
under
four
hours
the
bank
said
adèle
staring
but
you
said
you
were
going
to
the
club
i
nodded
i
know
i
was
anxious
to
raise
no
false
hopes
all
the
same
i
could
help
feeling
that
half
a
million
francs
were
worth
a
tenpenny
wire
therefore
i
telegraphed
to
jonah
his
answer
will
show
whether
that
tenpenny
wire
was
worth
half
a
million
francs
my
wife
snatched
the
form
from
my
hand
and
tore
it
open
it
was
very
short
repurchased
but
my
memory
never
recovered
from
the
slight
to
this
day
i
can
not
remember
to
ask
adèle
what
it
was
that
she
had
been
about
to
say
when
the
first
tire
burst
outside
bidache
chapter
x
how
berry
sought
comfort
in
vain
and
nobby
slept
upon
a
queen
bed
time
was
getting
on
the
season
at
pau
was
approaching
the
end
of
its
course
already
villas
and
flats
and
servants
were
being
engaged
for
the
winter
to
come
we
had
been
asked
definitely
whether
we
proposed
to
return
and
if
so
whether
we
wished
again
to
occupy
the
excellent
villa
we
had
not
knowing
what
answer
to
make
to
the
first
question
we
had
passed
to
the
second
somewhat
illogically
the
second
had
proved
more
heatedly
disputable
than
the
first
finally
jill
had
looked
up
from
a
letter
to
piers
and
put
in
her
oar
with
a
splash
the
villa
all
right
she
announced
everyone
says
it
the
best
and
so
should
we
if
we
did
live
in
it
it
what
inside
so
awful
even
one
decent
sofa
would
make
all
the
difference
in
silence
we
pondered
her
words
at
length
i
confess
said
berry
that
the
idea
of
having
a
few
chairs
about
in
which
you
can
sit
continuously
for
ten
minutes
not
so
much
in
comfort
as
without
fear
of
contracting
a
or
necrosis
of
the
coccyx
appeals
to
me
compared
with
most
of
the
in
this
here
villa
an
ordinary
church
pew
is
almost
voluptuous
the
beastly
things
seem
designed
to
promote
myalgia
yet
they
do
know
said
i
the
french
i
mean
look
at
their
beds
exactly
replied
my
that
the
maddening
part
of
it
every
french
bed
is
an
idyll
a
poem
of
repose
the
upholsterer
puts
his
soul
into
its
creation
a
born
genius
he
expresses
himself
in
beds
the
rest
of
the
junk
he
turns
out
he
broke
off
and
glanced
about
the
room
his
eye
lighted
upon
a
couch
featuring
the
pattern
in
brown
upon
a
ground
and
surrounded
on
three
sides
by
a
white
balustrade
some
three
inches
high
just
consider
that
throne
does
it
or
does
it
not
suggest
collusion
between
a
workshop
a
labourer
and
the
berlin
branch
of
the
if
said
daphne
it
was
only
the
chairs
i
would
mind
but
everything
the
sideboard
for
instance
ah
said
her
husband
my
favourite
piece
the
idea
of
a
double
is
very
beautifully
carried
out
i
always
expecting
falcon
to
press
something
and
a
couple
of
basins
to
appear
then
we
can
wash
directly
after
the
asparagus
the
truth
is
said
adèle
these
villas
are
furnished
to
be
let
and
when
you
said
that
you
said
everything
i
agree
said
i
and
if
we
liked
pau
enough
to
come
back
next
autumn
the
best
thing
to
do
is
to
have
a
villa
of
our
own
i
quite
ready
to
face
another
three
winters
here
and
if
everyone
else
is
it
be
worth
while
as
for
furniture
we
can
easily
pick
out
enough
from
cholmondely
street
and
white
ladies
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
i
on
said
jonah
who
had
caught
three
splendid
salmon
in
the
last
two
days
this
place
suits
me
and
me
said
adèle
warmly
my
sister
turned
to
her
husband
what
think
old
chap
berry
smiled
beatifically
a
look
came
into
his
eyes
i
shall
personally
superintend
he
announced
the
removal
and
destruction
of
the
geyser
amid
some
excitement
the
matter
was
then
and
there
decided
the
more
we
thought
upon
it
the
sounder
seemed
the
idea
the
place
suited
us
all
to
have
our
things
about
us
would
be
wholly
delightful
provided
we
meant
for
the
future
to
winter
abroad
we
should
save
money
pleasedly
we
proceeded
to
lunch
throughout
the
meal
we
discussed
what
manner
of
house
ours
must
be
situation
dimensions
aspect
we
argued
amiably
about
its
garden
and
curtilage
we
determined
to
insist
upon
two
bathrooms
by
the
time
the
cheese
was
served
we
had
selected
most
of
the
furniture
and
were
bickering
about
the
style
of
the
then
we
rang
up
a
to
learn
that
he
had
no
unfurnished
villa
to
let
upon
his
books
he
added
gratuitously
that
except
for
a
ruined
château
upon
the
other
side
of
tarbes
he
had
nothing
for
sale
either
so
soon
as
we
had
recovered
we
returned
to
the
charge
the
third
agent
we
addressed
was
not
quite
certain
there
was
he
said
a
house
in
the
town
solids
très
serieuse
dans
un
quartier
it
would
he
thought
be
to
our
liking
it
had
for
instance
salle
de
fête
he
was
not
sure
however
that
it
was
still
available
a
french
gentleman
was
much
attracted
and
had
visited
it
three
times
we
were
greatly
disgusted
and
said
so
we
did
not
want
a
house
in
the
town
we
wanted
finally
we
succumbed
to
his
entreaties
and
promised
to
view
the
villa
if
it
was
still
in
the
market
he
was
to
ring
us
up
in
ten
time
so
it
happened
that
half
an
hour
later
we
were
standing
curiously
before
the
great
iron
gates
of
a
broad
shuttered
mansion
in
the
rue
mazagran
pau
while
the
agent
was
alternately
pealing
the
bell
for
the
caretaker
and
making
encouraging
gestures
in
our
direction
viewed
from
without
the
villa
was
not
unpleasing
it
looked
extremely
it
stood
back
from
the
pavement
it
had
plenty
of
elbow
room
the
street
itself
was
as
silent
as
the
tomb
perhaps
if
we
could
find
nothing
else
we
began
to
wonder
whether
you
could
see
the
mountains
from
the
second
floor
at
last
a
caretaker
appeared
i
whistled
to
nobby
and
we
passed
up
a
short
drive
a
moment
later
we
had
left
the
sunlight
behind
and
had
entered
a
huge
dim
hall
damp
said
berry
instantly
sniffing
the
air
damp
for
a
monkey
i
can
smell
the
good
red
earth
daphne
sniffed
thoughtfully
i
do
think
so
she
said
when
a
house
has
been
shut
up
like
this
it
bound
to
it
wonderful
said
her
husband
what
you
ca
smell
when
you
do
want
to
never
mind
if
you
want
to
live
over
water
i
care
but
do
say
i
did
warn
you
besides
it
save
us
money
we
can
grow
moss
on
the
floors
instead
of
carpets
it
does
smell
damp
said
adèle
but
there
central
heating
see
she
pointed
to
a
huge
radiator
if
that
works
as
it
should
make
your
carpets
fade
berry
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
see
what
it
is
he
said
you
two
girls
have
scented
cupboards
i
never
yet
knew
a
woman
who
could
resist
cupboards
in
a
woman
eyes
a
superfluity
of
cupboards
can
transform
the
most
poisonous
habitation
into
a
desirable
residence
if
you
asked
a
woman
what
was
the
use
of
a
staircase
she
say
put
cupboards
under
by
now
the
shutters
had
been
opened
and
we
were
able
to
see
about
us
as
we
were
glancing
round
the
caretaker
shuffled
to
a
door
beneath
the
stairs
here
is
a
magnificent
cupboard
she
announced
there
are
many
others
as
we
passed
through
the
house
we
proved
the
truth
of
her
words
i
have
never
seen
so
many
cupboards
to
the
square
mile
in
all
my
life
my
wife
and
my
sister
strove
to
dissemble
their
delight
at
length
cousin
jill
however
spoke
frankly
enough
they
really
are
beautiful
think
of
the
room
they
give
you
be
able
to
put
everything
away
berry
turned
to
me
is
it
enough
to
induce
a
recesses
walled
up
with
painted
wood
birthplaces
of
mice
impregnable
of
vermin
and
who
wants
to
everything
away
hush
said
i
they
ca
help
it
besides
hullo
another
bathroom
without
a
bath
observed
my
how
very
convenient
of
course
you
up
much
quicker
are
you
i
suppose
the
idea
is
not
to
keep
people
waiting
come
along
we
passed
into
a
bedroom
oh
what
a
dream
of
a
paper
won
the
or
the
battle
of
the
blues
fancy
waking
up
here
after
a
heavy
night
i
suppose
the
designer
was
found
but
insane
another
two
cupboards
thanks
that
and
yet
another
oh
no
the
backstairs
of
course
as
before
approached
by
a
door
which
slides
to
and
fro
with
a
gentle
rumbling
noise
instead
of
swinging
the
same
warranted
to
jam
if
opened
hastily
ca
you
hear
falcon
on
the
wrong
side
with
a
butler
tray
full
of
glass
wondering
why
he
was
born
oh
and
the
bijou
spiral
leads
to
the
does
it
i
see
adèle
american
trunks
especially
the
cube
will
go
up
there
beautifully
falcon
will
like
this
house
wo
he
i
wish
to
goodness
you
be
quiet
said
daphne
i
want
to
think
it
not
me
said
her
husband
it
that
and
now
where
the
tower
i
suppose
that
approached
by
a
wire
rope
with
knots
in
it
what
tower
said
adèle
tower
the
feature
of
the
house
or
was
it
a
ballroom
ah
i
cried
the
ballroom
i
quite
forgotten
i
turned
to
the
agent
did
you
say
there
was
a
ballroom
but
yes
on
the
i
will
show
it
to
you
at
once
we
followed
him
downstairs
in
single
file
and
so
across
the
hall
to
where
two
tall
oak
doors
were
suggesting
a
for
a
moment
the
fellow
fumbled
at
their
lock
then
he
pushed
the
two
open
i
did
not
know
that
outside
a
palace
there
was
such
a
chamber
in
all
france
of
superb
proportions
the
room
was
panelled
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
oak
richly
carved
oak
and
every
handsome
panel
was
outlined
with
gold
the
ceiling
was
all
of
oak
fretted
with
gold
the
floor
was
of
polished
oak
inlaid
with
ebony
at
the
end
of
the
room
three
lovely
pillars
upheld
a
minstrels
gallery
while
opposite
a
stately
oriel
yawned
a
tremendous
fireplace
with
two
stone
seraphim
for
jambs
in
answer
to
our
bewildered
inquiries
the
agent
explained
excitedly
that
the
villa
had
been
built
upon
the
remains
of
a
much
older
house
and
that
while
the
other
portions
of
the
original
mansion
had
disappeared
this
great
chamber
and
the
basement
were
still
surviving
but
that
was
all
beyond
that
it
was
once
a
residence
of
note
he
could
tell
us
nothing
rather
naturally
we
devoted
more
time
to
the
ballroom
than
to
all
the
rest
of
the
house
against
our
saner
judgment
the
possession
of
the
apartment
attracted
us
greatly
it
was
too
vast
to
be
used
with
comfort
as
a
the
occasions
upon
which
we
should
enjoy
it
as
salle
de
would
be
comparatively
few
four
ordinary
would
require
less
service
and
fuel
yet
in
spite
of
everything
we
wanted
it
very
much
the
rest
of
the
house
was
convenient
the
parlours
were
fine
and
airy
there
were
two
bathrooms
the
bedrooms
were
good
the
offices
were
admirable
as
for
the
basement
we
lost
our
way
there
it
was
profound
it
was
also
indubitably
damp
there
the
dank
smell
upon
which
berry
had
remarked
was
most
compelling
in
the
garden
stood
a
garage
which
would
take
both
the
cars
after
a
final
inspection
of
the
ballroom
we
tipped
the
caretaker
promised
to
let
the
agent
know
our
decision
and
to
the
great
inconvenience
of
other
pedestrians
strolled
talkatively
through
the
streets
towards
the
boulevard
i
suppose
said
adèle
those
were
the
other
people
who
were
the
other
people
i
demanded
the
two
men
standing
in
the
hall
as
we
came
downstairs
i
never
saw
them
said
i
but
if
you
mean
that
one
of
them
was
the
fellow
who
after
the
house
i
fancy
you
wrong
because
the
agent
told
me
he
gone
to
bordeaux
well
i
do
know
who
they
were
then
replied
my
wife
they
were
talking
to
the
caretaker
i
saw
them
through
the
banisters
by
the
time
we
got
down
they
disappeared
any
way
it
does
matter
only
if
it
was
them
it
looks
as
if
they
were
thinking
pretty
seriously
about
it
you
do
go
to
see
a
house
four
times
out
of
curiosity
you
mean
said
berry
that
if
we
fools
enough
to
take
it
better
get
a
move
on
exactly
let
go
and
have
tea
at
bouzom
and
thrash
it
out
there
no
one
of
us
i
imagine
will
ever
forget
that
tea
crowded
about
a
table
intended
to
accommodate
four
we
alternately
disputed
and
insulted
one
another
for
the
better
part
of
two
hours
not
once
but
twice
of
her
agitation
my
sister
replenished
the
teapot
with
jill
chocolate
and
twice
fresh
tea
had
to
be
brought
berry
burned
his
mouth
and
dropped
an
apricot
tartlet
on
to
his
shoe
until
my
disgust
was
excited
by
a
nauseous
taste
i
continued
to
drink
from
a
cup
in
which
jonah
had
extinguished
a
cigarette
finally
berry
pushed
back
his
chair
and
looked
at
his
watch
ladies
and
gentlemen
he
said
we
came
here
this
memorable
afternoon
to
discuss
the
advisability
of
taking
a
certain
messuage
to
wit
the
villa
buichi
for
the
space
of
three
years
as
a
result
of
that
discussion
i
have
formed
certain
conclusions
in
the
first
place
i
am
satisfied
that
to
dwell
with
you
or
any
of
you
in
the
villa
buichi
or
any
other
habitation
for
the
space
of
three
years
presents
a
prospect
so
horrifying
as
to
belittle
death
itself
secondly
while
my
main
object
in
visiting
the
said
messuage
was
to
insure
if
possible
against
the
future
contraction
of
some
complaint
or
disease
of
the
hams
i
have
i
fear
already
defeated
that
object
by
sitting
for
upwards
of
ninety
minutes
upon
a
chair
which
is
rather
harder
than
the
living
rock
and
whose
surface
i
have
reason
to
believe
is
studded
with
barbs
thirdly
whilst
we
are
all
agreed
that
a
rent
of
fourteen
thousand
francs
is
grotesque
i
rather
pay
twice
that
sum
out
of
my
own
pocket
than
continue
an
argument
which
threatens
to
affect
my
mind
fourthly
the
house
is
not
what
we
want
or
where
we
want
it
the
prospect
of
wassailing
in
your
own
comic
is
alluring
but
the
french
cook
believes
in
oil
and
to
us
living
in
the
town
every
passing
breeze
will
offer
indisputable
evidence
not
only
of
the
lengths
to
which
this
belief
will
go
but
of
the
pentateuchal
effects
which
can
be
obtained
by
a
fearless
application
of
heat
to
rancid
blubber
fifthly
since
we
can
get
nothing
else
and
the
thought
of
another
winter
in
england
is
almost
as
as
that
of
living
again
amid
french
furniture
i
suppose
we
better
take
it
always
provided
they
fill
up
the
basement
put
on
a
mansard
roof
add
a
few
cupboards
and
reduce
the
rent
sixthly
i
wish
to
heaven
i
never
seen
the
blasted
place
lastly
i
now
propose
to
repair
to
the
or
english
club
there
in
the
privacy
of
the
to
remove
the
traces
of
the
preserved
apricot
recently
adhering
to
my
right
shoe
and
afterwards
to
ascertain
whether
a
dry
martini
cupped
in
the
mouth
will
do
something
to
relieve
the
agony
i
am
suffering
as
the
direct
result
of
concentrating
on
this
rotten
scheme
to
the
exclusion
of
my
bodily
needs
but
there
you
are
when
the
happiness
of
others
is
at
stake
i
forget
that
i
exist
with
that
he
picked
up
his
hat
and
before
we
could
stop
him
walked
out
of
the
shop
with
such
an
avowal
ringing
in
our
ears
it
was
too
much
to
expect
that
he
would
remember
that
he
had
ordered
the
tea
and
had
personally
consumed
seven
cakes
not
counting
the
apricot
tart
however
i
followed
him
to
the
club
rang
up
the
agent
and
offered
to
take
the
house
for
three
years
at
a
rent
of
twelve
thousand
francs
he
promised
to
telephone
to
our
villa
within
the
hour
he
was
as
good
as
his
word
he
telephoned
to
say
that
the
french
gentleman
who
had
unexpectedly
returned
from
bordeaux
had
just
submitted
an
offer
of
fourteen
thousand
francs
he
added
that
unless
we
were
prepared
to
offer
a
higher
rent
it
would
be
his
duty
to
accept
that
proposal
after
a
moment
thought
i
told
him
to
do
his
duty
and
bade
him
adieu
that
night
was
so
beautiful
that
we
had
the
cars
open
as
we
approached
the
casino
let
just
go
up
the
boulevard
said
daphne
this
is
too
lovely
to
leave
i
slowed
up
waited
for
jonah
to
come
alongside
and
then
communicated
our
intention
to
continue
to
take
the
air
the
boulevard
being
deserted
ping
and
pong
proceeded
slowly
abreast
a
sunset
which
had
hung
the
sky
with
rose
painted
the
and
turned
the
west
into
a
blazing
smeltery
of
dreams
had
slowly
yielded
to
a
night
starlit
velvety
breathless
big
with
the
gentle
witchcraft
of
an
amber
moon
nature
went
masked
the
depths
upon
our
left
seemed
bottomless
a
grey
flash
spoke
of
the
gave
de
pau
beyond
the
random
rise
and
fall
of
a
high
ridge
argued
the
summit
of
a
gigantic
screen
the
foothills
to
wit
odd
twinkling
points
of
yellow
light
seemingly
pendent
in
the
air
marking
the
farms
and
villas
planted
about
their
flanks
and
that
is
all
a
row
of
poplars
certainly
very
correct
very
slight
very
elegant
by
the
way
that
we
take
for
lourdes
the
row
of
poplars
should
be
recorded
the
luminous
stars
also
and
a
sweet
white
glow
in
the
heaven
just
where
the
ridge
of
the
foothills
cuts
it
across
a
trick
of
the
moonlight
no
doubt
sirs
it
is
no
such
trick
that
misty
radiance
is
the
driven
snow
resting
upon
the
peaks
of
the
pyrenees
the
moon
is
shining
full
on
them
and
forty
miles
distant
though
they
are
you
see
them
rendering
her
light
as
will
a
and
by
that
humble
office
clothing
themselves
with
unimaginable
splendour
as
we
stole
into
the
place
royale
every
minute
announced
adèle
i
more
and
more
thankful
that
quit
of
the
villa
buichi
we
should
have
been
simply
mad
to
have
taken
a
house
in
the
town
there
you
are
said
berry
my
very
words
over
and
over
again
i
insisted
if
you
mean
said
jonah
that
throughout
the
argument
you
confined
yourself
to
destructive
criticism
deliberate
confusion
of
the
issues
and
the
recommendation
of
solutions
which
you
knew
to
be
impracticable
i
entirely
agree
the
trouble
with
you
said
berry
is
that
you
do
appreciate
the
value
of
controversy
i
do
blame
you
considering
the
backlash
in
your
spinal
cord
i
think
you
talk
very
well
it
only
when
what
exactly
said
adèle
bubbling
is
the
value
of
controversy
its
unique
ability
said
berry
to
produce
the
truth
the
hotter
the
furnace
of
argument
the
harder
the
facts
which
eventually
emerge
that
why
i
never
spare
myself
i
do
pretend
it
easy
but
then
i
like
that
somebody
offers
you
a
drink
the
easiest
way
is
to
refuse
but
i
do
i
always
ask
myself
whether
my
health
demands
it
there
was
an
outraged
silence
then
i
have
noticed
i
observed
that
upon
such
occasions
your
brain
works
very
fast
also
that
you
invariably
choose
the
er
harder
path
nothing
is
easier
said
berry
than
to
deride
infirmity
having
compassed
the
place
royale
we
returned
to
the
boulevard
and
now
if
you
quite
finished
maundering
over
the
beauties
of
a
landscape
which
you
ca
see
supposing
we
focussed
on
the
object
with
which
we
set
out
i
thought
out
a
new
step
i
want
to
show
you
it
called
slip
stitch
every
third
beat
you
stagger
and
cross
your
legs
above
the
knee
that
shows
you
been
twice
to
the
crusades
then
you
purl
two
and
cast
four
off
if
you
still
together
you
get
up
and
repeat
to
the
end
of
the
row
knitways
decreasing
once
at
every
turn
then
you
cast
off
very
loosely
happily
the
speaker
was
in
the
other
car
so
we
broke
away
and
fled
up
the
rue
du
lycée
the
was
crowded
every
english
visitor
seemed
to
be
there
but
they
were
not
all
dancing
and
the
floor
was
just
pleasantly
full
as
we
came
in
i
touched
adèle
on
the
arm
will
you
dance
with
me
lass
i
was
not
one
moment
too
soon
as
i
spoke
two
gallants
arrived
to
lodge
their
claims
i
accepted
my
husband
said
adèle
smiling
she
had
to
promise
the
next
and
the
one
after
whilst
we
were
dancing
she
promised
the
fourth
and
the
fifth
i
can
see
said
i
that
i
in
for
my
usual
evening
of
course
we
too
highly
civilised
i
feed
you
i
lodge
you
i
clothe
you
i
held
her
off
and
looked
at
her
yes
with
outstanding
success
a
glorious
colour
your
eyes
are
like
stars
and
your
frock
is
a
marvel
in
fact
you
almost
too
good
to
be
true
from
your
wonderful
hair
to
the
soles
of
your
little
pink
feet
you
an
exquisite
production
whoever
did
see
such
a
mouth
i
suppose
you
know
i
married
you
for
your
mouth
and
your
throat
and
but
i
digress
as
i
was
saying
all
this
is
due
to
me
if
i
fed
you
exclusively
on
farinaceous
food
you
look
pale
if
i
locked
you
out
of
nights
you
look
tired
if
i
did
clothe
you
look
well
you
would
be
here
would
you
i
mean
i
know
we
move
pretty
fast
nowadays
but
certain
conventions
are
still
observed
very
well
then
i
am
responsible
for
your
glory
i
bring
you
here
and
everybody
in
the
room
dances
with
you
except
myself
to
complete
the
comedy
i
have
only
to
remind
you
that
i
love
dancing
and
that
you
are
the
best
dancer
in
the
room
i
ask
you
that
just
what
you
do
do
said
adèle
with
a
maddening
smile
if
you
did
but
certain
conventions
said
adèle
are
still
observed
have
i
ever
refused
you
you
could
that
why
i
do
ask
you
i
do
believe
you
said
adèle
if
it
was
leap
year
pretend
it
is
and
i
wanted
to
dance
with
you
pretend
you
do
the
music
stopped
with
a
crash
and
a
moment
later
a
frenchman
was
bowing
over
my
wife
hand
may
i
come
for
a
dance
later
he
asked
not
this
evening
i
promised
the
next
four
there
will
i
trust
be
a
fifth
and
after
that
i
given
my
husband
the
lot
you
do
understand
do
you
you
see
i
must
keep
in
with
him
he
feeds
me
and
lodges
me
and
clothes
me
and
the
frenchman
bowed
if
he
has
clothed
you
madame
i
can
forgive
him
anything
we
passed
to
a
table
at
which
berry
was
superintending
the
icing
of
some
champagne
ah
there
you
are
he
exclaimed
had
your
evening
dance
good
i
ordered
this
little
hopeful
passer
le
they
two
more
baubles
in
the
offing
and
sharp
at
we
start
on
fried
eggs
and
beer
judging
from
the
contracts
into
which
my
wife
has
entered
during
the
last
six
minutes
we
shall
be
here
till
three
here
he
produced
and
prepared
to
inflate
an
the
great
wheeze
about
these
is
not
to
there
was
a
horrified
cry
from
daphne
and
a
shriek
of
laughter
from
adèle
and
jill
i
implore
you
said
my
sister
to
put
that
thing
away
what
thing
said
her
husband
applying
the
nozzle
to
his
lips
that
cushion
thing
how
could
you
what
scrap
my
said
berry
darling
you
rave
you
going
to
spend
the
next
four
hours
afloat
upon
your
beautiful
toes
with
a
large
hand
supporting
the
small
of
your
back
i
not
i
going
to
maintain
a
sitting
posture
with
one
of
the
for
rest
provided
by
a
malignant
casino
directly
intervening
between
the
base
of
my
trunk
and
the
floor
now
i
know
that
intervention
it
of
the
harsh
unyielding
type
hence
this
with
that
he
stepped
on
to
the
floor
raised
the
as
if
it
were
an
instrument
of
music
and
adopting
the
attitude
and
manners
of
a
cornet
soloist
exhaled
into
the
nozzle
with
all
his
might
there
was
a
roar
of
laughter
then
mercifully
the
band
started
and
the
embarrassing
attention
of
about
sixty
pairs
of
eyes
was
diverted
accordingly
a
moment
later
my
and
i
had
the
table
to
ourselves
and
now
said
berry
forward
with
that
bauble
the
rump
parliament
is
off
perhaps
because
it
was
a
warm
evening
the
casino
furnaces
were
in
full
blast
after
a
while
the
heat
became
oppressive
presently
i
left
berry
to
the
champagne
and
went
for
a
stroll
in
the
palmarium
as
i
was
completing
my
second
lap
captain
pleydell
said
a
dignified
voice
i
turned
to
see
waterbrook
leaning
upon
a
stick
accompanied
by
a
remarkably
pretty
young
lady
with
her
hair
down
her
back
i
came
to
them
swiftly
have
you
met
with
an
accident
i
inquired
i
have
i
ricked
my
ankle
susan
this
is
captain
pleydell
whose
cousin
is
going
to
marry
piers
captain
pleydell
this
is
susan
my
only
niece
now
i
going
to
sit
down
i
escorted
her
to
a
chair
that
better
captain
pleydell
have
you
seen
the
château
often
said
i
a
large
grey
building
with
a
red
keep
close
to
the
one
to
you
said
waterbrook
now
i
begin
again
captain
pleydell
have
you
seen
the
inside
of
the
château
i
have
not
then
you
ought
said
waterbrook
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
been
six
months
in
pau
and
you
never
taken
the
trouble
to
go
and
look
at
one
of
the
finest
collections
of
tapestries
in
the
world
what
are
you
doing
morning
going
to
see
the
inside
of
the
château
i
said
good
so
susan
she
meet
you
at
the
gate
on
the
boulevard
at
ten
she
only
arrived
yesterday
and
now
her
mother
wants
her
and
she
got
to
go
back
she
wild
to
see
the
château
before
she
goes
and
i
ca
take
her
because
of
this
silly
foot
i
awfully
sorry
said
i
but
it
an
ill
wind
etc
susan
said
waterbrook
that
a
compliment
is
it
your
first
no
said
susan
but
it
the
slickest
the
what
cried
her
aunt
i
mean
i
did
see
it
coming
i
began
to
like
susan
snorted
waterbrook
nasty
vulgar
slang
if
you
were
going
to
be
here
longer
captain
pleydell
wife
should
give
you
lessons
in
english
she
is
a
teacher
you
know
she
an
american
with
a
silver
tongue
and
there
that
wretched
bell
she
rose
to
her
feet
if
i
remembered
that
manon
had
more
than
three
acts
i
would
have
come
she
turned
to
me
is
jill
here
she
is
will
you
tell
her
to
come
and
find
us
in
the
next
interval
i
will
good
ten
good
night
on
the
way
to
the
doors
of
the
theatre
she
stopped
to
speak
with
someone
and
susan
came
running
back
captain
pleydell
is
your
wife
here
i
nodded
well
then
when
jill
with
aunt
eleanor
think
i
could
i
mean
if
you
would
mind
i
i
love
a
lesson
in
english
i
began
to
like
susan
more
than
ever
i
see
if
she
got
a
spare
hour
i
said
at
ten
susan
knitted
her
brows
no
do
upset
that
she
said
quickly
it
does
matter
i
want
to
be
able
to
tell
them
i
had
you
alone
but
if
i
could
say
i
met
your
wife
too
it
be
simply
golden
as
soon
as
i
could
speak
you
wicked
forward
child
i
said
you
said
susan
do
be
late
somewhat
dazedly
i
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
de
so
dazedly
in
fact
that
i
collided
with
a
young
frenchman
who
was
watching
the
progress
of
jeu
de
this
was
hardly
exhilarating
of
the
seven
beings
gathered
about
the
table
six
were
croupiers
and
the
seventh
was
reading
i
collided
roughly
enough
to
knock
a
cigarette
out
of
my
victim
hand
i
mean
monsieur
je
vous
demande
it
quite
all
right
he
said
smiling
i
should
have
been
standing
so
far
out
i
drew
a
case
from
my
pocket
at
least
i
said
you
allow
me
to
replace
the
cigarette
he
took
one
with
a
laugh
and
to
congratulate
you
upon
your
beautiful
english
thank
you
very
much
for
all
that
you
knew
i
was
french
in
another
minute
said
i
i
shall
be
uncertain
and
i
sure
deceive
a
frenchman
every
time
i
do
frequently
it
amuses
me
to
death
only
the
other
day
i
had
to
produce
my
passport
to
a
merchant
at
lyons
before
he
believe
i
was
a
foreigner
a
foreigner
i
cried
with
bulging
eyes
then
you
are
english
i
a
spaniard
was
the
reply
i
tell
you
it
most
diverting
talk
about
ringing
the
changes
i
had
a
great
time
during
the
war
i
was
a
perfect
mine
of
information
it
was
strictly
accurate
but
germany
did
know
that
as
a
traitor
they
found
me
extremely
useful
as
a
desirable
neutral
i
cut
a
great
deal
of
ice
and
now
i
loafing
i
used
to
take
an
interest
in
the
prevention
of
crime
but
i
grown
lazy
for
a
moment
or
two
we
stood
talking
then
i
asked
him
to
come
to
our
table
in
the
he
declined
gracefully
i
spanish
enough
to
dislike
jazz
music
he
said
we
agreed
to
meet
at
the
club
on
the
following
day
and
i
rejoined
berry
to
tell
him
what
he
had
missed
i
found
the
fifth
dance
in
full
swing
and
my
in
high
dudgeon
as
i
sat
down
he
exploded
this
blasted
is
a
fraud
if
you
blow
it
up
tight
like
trying
to
sit
on
a
barrel
if
you
fill
it
half
full
you
move
a
muscle
or
the
imprisoned
air
keeps
shifting
all
over
the
place
till
one
feels
sick
of
one
stomach
in
either
case
it
as
hard
as
petrified
if
you
only
leave
an
imperial
pint
in
the
vessel
it
all
goes
and
gathers
in
one
corner
thus
conveying
to
one
the
impression
that
one
is
sitting
one
self
upon
a
naked
chair
with
a
in
one
if
one
puts
the
swine
behind
one
it
shoves
one
off
the
seat
altogether
it
was
during
the
second
phase
that
one
dropped
or
let
fall
one
cigar
into
one
champagne
one
had
thought
that
anything
could
have
spoiled
either
but
one
was
wrong
i
did
what
i
could
to
soothe
him
but
without
avail
i
warn
you
he
continued
there
worse
to
come
misfortunes
hunt
in
threes
first
we
fool
and
are
fooled
over
that
rotten
villa
now
this
balloon
lets
me
down
you
wait
i
decided
that
to
argue
that
the
failure
of
the
could
hardly
be
reckoned
a
calamity
would
be
almost
as
provocative
as
to
suggest
that
the
immersion
of
the
cigar
should
rank
as
the
third
disaster
so
i
moistened
the
lips
and
illustrated
an
indictment
of
our
present
system
of
education
by
a
report
of
my
encounter
with
susan
berry
heard
me
in
silence
and
then
desired
me
to
try
the
chairs
at
the
château
and
if
they
were
favouring
repose
to
inquire
whether
the
place
would
be
let
furnished
stifling
an
inclination
to
assault
him
i
laughed
pleasantly
and
related
my
meeting
with
the
engaging
spaniard
when
i
had
finished
how
much
did
you
lend
him
inquired
my
or
is
a
pal
of
his
taking
care
of
your
watch
the
came
to
an
end
and
i
rose
to
my
feet
the
average
weight
i
said
of
the
spleen
is
i
believe
six
ounces
but
spleens
have
been
taken
weighing
twenty
pounds
net
or
rod
said
berry
now
you
see
i
continued
why
you
so
heavy
on
the
chairs
with
that
i
sought
my
wife
and
led
her
away
to
watch
the
baccarat
before
we
had
been
in
the
gaming
room
for
twenty
seconds
adèle
caught
me
by
the
arm
see
that
man
over
there
boy
with
a
bangle
on
his
wrist
and
a
shirt
behind
his
diamond
i
do
that
one
of
the
men
i
saw
in
the
villa
buichi
the
devil
it
is
said
i
then
i
take
it
he
the
new
lessee
well
well
he
go
well
with
the
ballroom
wo
he
it
was
a
fellow
and
oily
his
fat
hands
were
manicured
and
he
was
overdressed
he
gave
the
impression
that
money
was
no
longer
an
object
as
if
to
corroborate
this
he
had
been
winning
heavily
i
decided
that
he
was
a
bookmaker
while
i
was
staring
adèle
moved
to
speak
with
a
friend
and
who
said
a
quiet
voice
is
attracting
such
faithful
attention
it
was
the
spaniard
you
see
that
fat
cove
i
whispered
he
did
us
out
of
a
house
overbid
us
you
know
my
companion
smiled
no
worse
than
that
he
murmured
you
must
count
yourselves
lucky
i
raised
my
eyebrows
you
know
him
the
other
nodded
not
personally
of
course
he
said
then
i
think
he
retired
now
what
was
he
said
i
the
biggest
receiver
in
france
ere
we
retired
to
rest
my
prophecy
that
there
was
to
come
was
distressingly
fulfilled
as
the
advanced
it
improved
out
of
all
knowledge
the
later
the
hour
the
hotter
became
the
fun
berry
ill
humour
fell
away
adèle
and
i
danced
furiously
together
vain
things
were
imagined
and
found
diverting
hospitality
was
dispensed
the
two
spare
were
reinforced
not
until
two
was
the
tambourine
of
gaiety
suffered
to
tumble
in
its
tracks
we
climbed
into
the
cars
flushed
and
hilarious
late
though
we
were
whenever
we
had
been
dancing
there
was
one
member
of
the
household
who
always
looked
for
our
return
and
met
us
upon
our
threshold
nobby
however
silently
the
cars
stole
up
the
drive
by
the
time
the
door
was
opened
always
the
sealyham
was
on
parade
his
small
feet
together
his
tail
up
his
rough
little
head
upon
one
side
waiting
to
greet
us
with
an
explosion
of
delight
in
his
bright
eyes
the
rite
was
never
stale
never
laborious
it
was
the
way
of
his
heart
naturally
enough
we
came
to
look
for
his
welcome
had
we
looked
in
vain
some
night
we
should
have
been
concerned
we
were
concerned
this
night
we
opened
the
door
to
find
the
hall
empty
nobby
was
not
upon
parade
tired
as
we
were
we
searched
the
whole
house
presently
i
found
a
note
upon
my
pyjamas
tell
you
we
can
not
find
nobby
the
chauffeur
and
me
looking
everywhere
and
fitch
as
been
out
in
pau
all
evening
in
quest
hoping
his
whereabouts
is
perhaps
known
to
you
respectfully
i
was
at
the
villa
buichi
the
following
morning
by
a
quarter
to
ten
it
seemed
just
possible
that
the
terrier
was
there
a
captive
that
he
was
with
us
before
we
visited
the
house
we
well
remembered
whether
he
had
entered
with
us
and
if
so
left
when
we
did
we
could
not
be
sure
we
had
had
much
to
think
about
the
caretaker
took
an
unconscionable
time
to
answer
the
bell
and
when
i
had
stated
my
business
stoutly
refused
to
let
me
search
the
villa
without
an
order
my
offer
of
money
was
offensively
refused
i
had
to
content
myself
with
standing
within
the
hall
and
whistling
as
loud
as
i
could
no
bark
replied
but
i
was
not
satisfied
and
determined
to
seek
the
agent
and
obtain
a
permit
the
moment
that
susan
and
i
had
the
château
it
was
in
some
irritation
that
i
made
my
way
to
the
boulevard
i
had
no
desire
to
see
the
inside
of
the
château
then
or
at
any
time
i
particularly
wished
to
prosecute
my
search
for
the
sealyham
without
delay
i
had
had
less
than
four
hours
sleep
and
was
feeling
rotten
in
a
smart
white
coat
and
skirt
and
a
white
felt
hat
over
one
eye
susan
looked
most
attractive
her
fresh
pretty
face
was
glowing
her
wonderful
golden
hair
was
full
of
lights
and
the
line
of
her
slim
figure
as
hands
thrust
deep
into
her
she
leaned
her
small
back
against
the
balustrade
was
more
than
dainty
her
little
feet
and
ankles
were
those
of
a
thoroughbred
as
i
descended
from
the
car
i
say
said
susan
i
got
a
stone
in
my
shoe
where
can
i
get
it
out
i
eyed
her
severely
you
will
have
a
lot
to
tell
them
i
said
wo
you
go
on
get
into
the
car
she
climbed
in
sat
down
and
leaned
back
luxuriously
then
she
thrust
out
a
foot
with
the
air
of
a
queen
when
i
had
replaced
her
shoe
she
thanked
me
with
a
shy
smile
then
i
say
she
said
suddenly
do
let
go
to
the
château
i
want
to
see
the
rotten
place
let
go
for
a
drive
instead
somewhere
where
you
can
let
her
out
and
on
the
way
back
you
can
take
me
to
get
some
gloves
susan
said
i
there
nothing
doing
i
know
a
drive
in
a
car
sounds
a
good
deal
more
than
being
shown
round
a
château
but
you
ca
have
everything
orders
is
orders
besides
i
lost
my
dog
and
i
want
to
get
a
move
on
but
for
that
you
should
have
done
the
château
and
had
your
drive
into
the
bargain
as
it
is
susan
is
a
good
girl
the
moment
she
heard
of
my
trouble
she
was
out
of
the
car
and
haling
me
up
to
the
château
as
if
there
was
a
mob
at
our
heels
i
was
not
in
the
mood
for
sightseeing
but
my
annoyance
went
down
before
the
tapestries
as
wheat
before
the
storm
standing
before
those
aged
exquisites
those
glorious
embodiments
of
patience
infinite
imagination
high
and
matchless
craftsmanship
i
forgot
everything
the
style
of
them
was
superb
they
had
quality
about
them
was
nothing
mean
they
were
so
rich
so
mellow
so
delicate
there
was
a
softness
to
the
lovely
tones
no
brush
could
ever
compass
miracles
of
detail
marvels
of
stately
effect
the
panels
were
breathing
the
spirit
of
their
age
looking
upon
them
i
stepped
into
another
world
i
heard
the
shouts
of
the
huntsmen
and
the
laughter
of
the
handmaidens
i
smelled
the
sweat
of
the
chargers
and
the
sweet
scent
of
the
grapes
i
felt
the
cool
touch
of
the
shade
upon
my
cheeks
always
the
shouts
were
distant
the
scent
faint
the
laughter
low
i
wandered
up
faery
glades
loitered
in
lazy
markets
listened
to
the
music
of
fountains
sat
before
ample
boards
bowed
over
hands
here
then
was
magic
things
other
than
silk
went
to
the
weaving
of
so
potent
a
spell
the
laborious
needle
put
in
the
dainty
threads
the
hearts
of
those
that
plied
it
put
in
most
precious
memories
treasures
of
love
and
laughter
the
swift
brush
of
lips
the
echo
of
a
call
in
the
forest
a
patch
of
sunlight
upon
the
slope
of
a
hill
such
stuff
indeed
as
dreams
are
made
on
and
there
is
the
bare
truth
gentlemen
just
as
i
have
stumbled
upon
it
the
tapestries
of
pau
are
dreams
which
you
may
go
and
share
any
day
except
sundays
we
had
almost
finished
our
tour
of
the
apartments
and
were
standing
in
the
bedroom
of
jeanne
staring
at
a
beautiful
gobelin
when
i
heard
the
flop
of
something
alighting
upon
the
floor
with
one
consent
the
keeper
susan
and
i
swung
on
our
heels
advancing
stiffly
towards
us
and
wagging
his
scrap
of
a
tail
was
a
small
dog
his
coat
was
plastered
with
filth
upon
one
of
his
ears
was
a
blotch
of
dried
blood
his
muzzle
and
paws
might
have
been
steeped
in
liquid
soot
he
stank
abominably
i
put
up
a
hand
to
my
head
nobby
i
cried
peering
and
then
again
the
urchin
crept
to
my
feet
put
his
small
dirty
head
on
one
side
lowered
it
to
the
ground
and
then
rolled
over
upon
his
back
with
his
legs
in
the
air
he
regarded
me
fixedly
tentatively
wagging
his
tail
dazedly
i
stooped
and
patted
the
mud
upon
his
stomach
the
bright
eyes
flashed
then
with
a
squirm
the
sealyham
was
on
his
feet
and
leaping
to
lick
my
face
shrieked
susan
shaking
me
by
the
arm
is
this
the
the
dog
you
lost
yes
i
shouted
it
is
not
until
then
did
the
custodian
of
the
apartments
find
his
tongue
it
is
your
dog
then
he
raved
he
has
marched
with
us
all
the
time
and
i
have
not
seen
him
without
an
attachment
in
all
these
noble
rooms
dieu
dogs
may
not
enter
even
the
grounds
but
he
must
junket
in
the
château
all
vile
as
he
is
and
smelling
like
twenty
goats
listen
said
i
it
my
dog
all
right
but
i
never
brought
him
i
been
looking
all
over
pau
what
on
earth
but
you
must
have
brought
him
it
is
evident
myself
i
have
shut
all
the
doors
no
one
has
the
keys
except
me
it
is
impossible
i
pointed
to
the
carved
bedstead
see
for
yourself
said
i
he
just
jumped
down
the
keeper
ran
to
the
bed
and
peered
behind
the
gorgeous
parapet
then
he
let
out
a
scream
of
agony
ah
it
is
true
ten
thousand
devils
that
so
beastly
a
dog
should
have
soiled
jeanne
bed
observe
the
nest
he
has
made
in
her
counterpane
dieu
it
is
scandalous
you
will
answer
for
this
i
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
i
but
unless
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
you
will
you
should
have
let
him
get
in
i
thought
the
fellow
would
have
choked
but
it
was
not
i
that
he
screamed
see
how
he
approaches
the
queen
screen
to
destroy
it
as
he
has
destroyed
her
bed
nonsense
i
said
shortly
he
very
struck
with
the
furniture
that
all
anybody
would
be
but
how
the
deuce
with
tears
in
his
eyes
the
keeper
besought
me
to
remove
my
dog
forthwith
in
the
circumstances
it
seemed
best
to
comply
so
wishing
very
much
that
nobby
could
speak
for
himself
i
tied
my
handkerchief
to
his
collar
and
with
susan
chattering
excitedly
and
clinging
to
my
arm
followed
our
gibbering
guide
to
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
he
must
have
followed
him
in
cried
susan
he
simply
must
i
looked
at
the
chimney
but
it
stopped
up
and
the
man
says
there
no
other
door
and
you
know
he
unlocked
each
one
as
we
came
to
it
this
morning
but
why
he
so
filthy
i
said
and
how
did
he
fetch
up
here
let
see
he
must
have
come
with
us
as
far
as
bouzom
that
only
five
minutes
from
here
then
we
forgot
all
about
him
and
left
him
outside
we
were
there
for
ages
i
suppose
he
got
fed
up
with
waiting
or
found
a
pal
or
something
and
drifted
down
here
all
the
same
i
turned
to
the
custodian
and
took
out
a
note
he
usually
pay
so
much
for
a
room
but
as
this
is
a
hotel
and
he
had
jeanne
bed
the
money
passed
in
silence
i
fancy
the
keeper
dared
not
trust
himself
to
speak
after
all
i
was
very
thankful
that
nobby
was
found
as
we
passed
out
of
the
gate
a
sudden
thought
came
to
me
and
i
turned
back
i
say
i
cried
when
last
did
you
visit
that
room
the
queen
room
i
nodded
yesterday
morning
monsieur
at
nine
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
i
walked
towards
the
car
like
a
man
in
a
dream
the
business
smacked
of
a
conjuring
trick
having
lost
the
terrier
in
the
town
i
had
been
sent
to
view
the
château
against
my
will
there
to
discover
my
missing
chattel
in
a
locked
chamber
upon
the
second
floor
to
add
to
the
confusion
of
my
wits
susan
was
talking
furiously
i
read
of
such
things
you
know
in
case
of
a
revolution
for
the
king
to
escape
they
say
there
one
at
buckingham
palace
one
what
said
i
abstractedly
underground
passage
said
susan
leading
out
into
the
open
the
one
from
buckingham
palace
goes
into
a
house
i
suppose
it
was
country
once
and
then
the
ground
was
built
over
or
of
course
it
might
always
have
led
into
the
house
and
they
just
had
loyal
people
living
there
or
someone
from
the
court
so
that
heaven
and
earth
i
roared
the
villa
buichi
susan
recoiled
with
a
cry
i
caught
her
white
arm
susan
i
yelled
you
got
it
in
one
the
last
time
we
saw
him
was
there
it
a
house
we
saw
yesterday
we
thought
of
taking
it
but
as
soon
as
he
saw
us
coming
another
chap
got
in
quick
what
a
shame
said
susan
if
only
you
had
it
you
been
able
to
go
and
look
at
the
tapestries
whenever
you
oh
whatever
the
matter
i
suppose
my
eyes
were
blazing
i
know
my
brain
was
the
murder
was
out
i
must
see
my
friend
the
spaniard
i
said
he
made
a
mistake
biggest
receiver
in
france
has
not
susan
stared
at
me
with
big
eyes
with
a
smile
i
flung
open
its
door
and
waved
her
into
the
car
i
followed
her
in
then
i
put
my
arm
round
her
waist
and
kissed
her
pink
cheek
now
said
i
you
have
something
to
tell
them
susan
gurgled
delightedly
the
french
are
nothing
if
not
artistic
they
are
also
good
showmen
it
was
largely
due
to
the
interest
of
señor
don
fedriani
that
five
days
later
i
had
the
privilege
of
sitting
for
fifty
minutes
upon
an
extremely
uncomfortable
chair
in
the
oratory
of
jeanne
and
listening
at
intervals
by
means
of
a
delicate
instrument
to
the
biggest
receiver
in
france
and
his
confederates
stumbling
still
more
uncomfortably
along
a
dank
and
noisome
passage
towards
penal
servitude
for
life
had
he
known
that
the
villa
buichi
was
surrounded
that
the
caretaker
was
already
in
custody
that
a
file
of
soldiers
was
following
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
his
rear
and
that
the
van
which
was
to
take
him
to
prison
was
waiting
in
the
château
courtyard
my
gentleman
who
had
soft
could
not
have
been
more
outspoken
about
the
condition
of
his
path
not
until
he
had
quite
finished
and
had
inquired
in
a
blasphemous
whisper
if
all
were
present
was
the
strip
of
magnesium
ignited
and
the
photograph
made
i
have
a
copy
before
me
the
knaves
are
not
looking
their
best
but
the
grouping
is
superb
toilet
of
makes
a
most
exquisite
background
chapter
xi
how
berry
put
off
his
manhood
and
adèle
showed
a
fair
pair
of
heels
but
for
susan
i
should
not
have
seen
the
château
and
but
for
the
merest
accident
we
should
not
have
revisited
gavarnie
and
that
would
have
been
a
great
shame
it
was
the
day
before
we
were
spared
this
lasting
reproach
that
my
stood
stiffly
before
a
in
his
deliberately
berry
surveyed
himself
we
stood
about
him
with
twitching
lips
not
daring
to
trust
our
tones
at
length
but
what
a
dream
said
my
what
an
exquisite
pluperfect
dream
jill
shut
her
eyes
and
began
to
shake
with
laughter
i
suppose
it
was
made
to
be
worn
or
think
someone
did
it
for
a
bet
gentleman
of
the
court
of
louis
xiv
well
i
suppose
a
french
firm
ought
to
know
only
if
they
right
i
wonder
there
was
a
revolution
no
nation
could
hold
up
its
head
with
a
lot
of
wasters
shuffling
about
versailles
with
the
seats
of
their
breeches
beginning
under
their
hocks
that
one
sleeve
is
three
inches
shorter
than
the
other
and
that
the
coat
would
comfortably
fit
a
boy
scout
i
pass
over
those
features
might
be
attributed
to
the
dictates
of
fashion
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
even
in
that
fantastic
age
a
waistcoat
like
a
loose
cover
ever
really
obtained
adèle
sank
into
a
chair
and
covered
her
eyes
with
an
effort
i
mastered
my
voice
i
think
perhaps
i
ventured
if
you
wore
them
for
an
hour
or
two
they
might
might
shake
down
you
see
i
continued
hurriedly
not
accustomed
brother
said
berry
gravely
you
got
it
in
one
i
not
accustomed
to
wearing
garments
such
as
these
i
confess
i
feel
strange
in
them
most
people
who
are
not
deformed
would
if
i
had
got
any
thighs
if
my
stomach
measurement
was
four
times
that
of
my
chest
and
i
only
one
arm
they
be
just
about
right
as
it
is
short
of
mutilation
ca
you
brace
up
the
breeches
a
little
higher
said
daphne
no
i
ca
snapped
her
husband
as
it
is
my
feet
are
nearly
off
the
ground
seated
upon
the
bed
jonah
rolled
over
upon
his
side
and
gave
himself
up
to
a
convulsion
of
silent
mirth
the
sleeves
and
the
waistcoat
continued
my
sister
are
nothing
adèle
and
i
can
easily
alter
them
what
worries
me
is
the
breeches
they
worry
you
a
damned
sight
more
if
you
had
on
said
berry
and
if
you
think
i
going
to
wear
this
little
even
as
amended
by
you
and
adèle
you
simply
unplaced
to
say
i
would
be
seen
dead
in
it
conveys
nothing
at
all
my
dear
boy
purred
daphne
be
reasonable
it
far
too
late
to
get
hold
of
anything
else
it
the
ball
of
the
season
and
fancy
dress
is
i
sure
if
you
would
only
brace
up
with
an
unearthly
shriek
berry
collapsed
in
my
arms
take
her
away
he
roared
take
her
away
before
i
offer
her
violence
explain
my
anatomy
tell
her
i
got
a
trunk
conceal
nothing
only
amid
the
explosion
of
laughter
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
lost
as
soon
as
we
could
speak
coherently
we
endeavoured
to
smooth
him
down
at
length
it
transparently
plain
said
jonah
that
that
dress
is
out
of
the
question
here
he
took
out
his
watch
let
see
it
now
three
that
gives
us
just
seven
hours
to
conceive
and
execute
some
other
confection
it
should
be
difficult
now
you
talking
said
berry
i
know
i
go
as
a
mahout
now
that
easy
six
feet
of
butter
muslin
four
pennyworth
of
woad
and
a
harpoon
and
we
can
lock
the
elephant
switch
and
park
him
in
the
rhododendrons
why
said
jonah
should
you
go
as
sycamore
tight
you
not
unlike
him
and
the
excitement
would
be
intense
after
a
little
discussion
we
turned
the
suggestion
down
for
all
that
it
was
not
without
merit
sycamore
tight
was
wanted
wanted
badly
there
was
a
price
upon
his
head
two
days
after
he
had
landed
in
france
a
large
american
bank
had
discovered
good
reason
to
believe
that
mr
tight
had
personally
depleted
its
funds
to
the
tune
of
over
a
million
daily
for
the
last
four
days
the
gentleman
photograph
had
appeared
in
every
french
paper
illustrating
a
succinct
and
compelling
advertisement
which
included
a
short
summary
of
his
characteristics
and
announced
the
offer
of
a
reward
of
fifty
thousand
francs
for
such
information
as
should
lead
to
his
arrest
the
french
know
the
value
of
money
if
the
interest
excited
at
pau
was
any
criterion
every
french
soul
in
france
went
about
his
business
with
bulging
eyes
indeed
if
sycamore
tight
were
yet
in
the
country
there
was
little
doubt
in
most
minds
that
his
days
were
numbered
no
said
berry
it
very
nice
to
think
that
i
look
so
much
like
the
brute
but
i
doubt
if
a
check
suit
quite
so
startling
as
that
he
seems
to
have
affected
could
be
procured
in
time
shall
i
go
as
marat
on
his
way
to
the
with
a
a
flannel
and
a
leer
i
should
be
practically
there
oh
and
a
box
of
matches
to
light
the
geyser
with
i
suppose
said
daphne
you
would
go
as
a
clown
adèle
and
i
could
do
that
easily
the
dress
is
nothing
is
it
indeed
said
her
husband
well
that
would
be
simplicity
itself
would
it
a
trifle
classical
perhaps
but
most
arresting
what
a
scene
there
be
when
i
took
off
my
overcoat
would
be
almost
as
artless
i
could
wear
a
worried
look
and
there
you
are
could
he
go
as
a
friar
said
jill
you
know
like
a
monk
only
not
so
gloomy
we
ought
to
be
able
to
get
a
robe
easily
and
if
we
could
get
sandals
he
could
go
barefoot
that
right
said
berry
do
mind
me
you
just
fix
everything
up
and
tell
me
in
time
to
change
oh
and
you
might
write
down
a
few
crisp
blessings
i
shall
get
tired
of
saying
when
anyone
kicks
my
feet
i
tell
you
what
said
adèle
would
you
go
as
flapper
a
what
said
my
miss
said
adèle
golf
girl
if
you
like
daphne
and
i
can
fit
you
out
and
you
can
wear
your
own
shoes
as
for
a
wig
any
do
a
nice
fluffy
bobbed
one
would
be
best
the
same
shade
as
your
moustache
instinctively
none
of
us
spoke
the
idea
was
so
admirable
the
result
would
be
so
triumphant
that
we
hardly
dared
to
breathe
lest
berry
should
stamp
upon
our
hopes
for
one
full
minute
he
fingered
his
chin
then
he
wrinkled
his
nose
not
golf
girl
he
said
that
much
too
pert
i
deliver
the
goods
no
i
must
go
as
something
more
luscious
what
about
queen
of
the
may
at
minutes
to
ten
that
evening
i
was
writing
a
note
and
wondering
while
i
did
so
whether
the
original
ever
sat
down
i
had
just
decided
that
rather
than
continually
risk
dislocation
of
the
knee
they
probably
either
reclined
or
leaned
against
pillars
when
fatigued
when
something
impelled
me
to
glance
over
my
shoulder
framed
in
the
doorway
was
standing
berry
a
frock
of
pale
pink
georgette
with
long
sleeves
and
a
black
velvet
girdle
knotted
at
one
side
fitted
him
seemingly
like
a
glove
a
large
leghorn
hat
its
black
velvet
streamers
fastened
beneath
his
chin
heavily
weighted
with
a
rose
over
one
eye
threatened
to
hide
his
rebellious
mop
of
hair
white
silk
stockings
and
a
pair
of
ordinary
pumps
completed
his
attire
a
miniature
apron
bearing
the
stencilled
legend
english
rose
upon
its
muslin
left
no
doubt
about
his
identity
beneath
my
gaze
he
looked
down
and
simpered
swinging
his
bead
bag
ridiculously
i
leaned
back
in
my
chair
and
began
to
laugh
like
a
madman
then
i
remembered
my
and
got
up
and
leaned
against
the
wall
whence
i
could
see
him
better
as
if
his
appearance
alone
were
not
enough
he
spoke
in
an
absurd
falsetto
no
i
not
supposed
to
be
out
till
after
easter
but
do
let
that
stop
you
i
mean
you
know
i
do
say
such
dreadful
things
and
all
the
time
father
always
calls
me
a
i
mean
but
i
do
care
have
you
any
sisters
what
not
even
a
oh
but
what
luck
i
mean
i
think
we
sit
this
one
out
shall
i
i
know
a
lovely
place
in
the
inspection
pit
i
often
go
and
sit
there
when
i
want
to
have
a
good
fruity
drink
i
mean
think
i
always
think
so
wonderful
to
look
up
and
see
the
and
the
differential
and
the
dear
old
and
feel
you
alone
with
them
all
absolutely
alone
the
tempestuous
arrival
of
adèle
looking
sweet
as
pierrette
and
jonah
in
the
traditional
garb
of
harlequin
cut
short
the
soliloquy
it
was
ere
the
two
had
recovered
from
their
first
paroxysm
of
laughter
that
berry
minced
to
the
fireplace
and
with
the
coyest
of
pecks
rang
the
electric
bell
a
moment
later
falcon
entered
the
room
my
laughed
and
looked
down
fingering
his
dress
oh
falcon
he
said
archly
about
i
do
know
whether
pleydell
told
you
but
there
be
four
extra
to
lunch
i
have
seen
falcon
eyes
twinkle
and
i
have
seen
his
mouth
work
times
without
number
i
have
seen
him
thrust
a
decanter
upon
the
sideboard
and
disappear
shaking
from
the
apartment
but
never
before
have
i
seen
his
crumple
as
a
ripped
balloon
for
a
second
he
stared
at
the
speaker
then
he
flung
us
one
desperate
appealing
glance
emitted
a
short
wail
and
looking
exactly
as
if
he
was
about
to
burst
into
tears
clapped
both
hands
to
his
mouth
and
made
a
rush
for
the
door
as
he
reached
it
a
little
dutch
jill
danced
into
the
room
looking
adorable
use
holds
falcon
straightened
his
back
stepped
to
one
side
and
bowed
his
apologies
the
temporary
check
however
was
his
undoing
as
jill
flashed
by
he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
sobbed
like
a
child
when
daphne
made
her
appearance
amazingly
beautiful
as
we
climbed
into
the
cars
and
slipped
down
the
sober
drive
into
the
fragrant
dalliance
of
an
april
night
the
ball
was
over
it
would
have
been
a
success
any
way
but
from
the
moment
that
berry
had
upon
arrival
been
directed
to
the
ladies
its
enduring
fame
had
been
assured
when
with
my
wife
and
sister
reluctant
and
protesting
upon
either
arm
he
erupted
into
the
ballroom
giggling
excitedly
and
crying
votes
for
women
in
a
shrill
treble
even
the
band
broke
down
so
that
the
music
died
an
untimely
and
tuneless
death
when
he
danced
a
tango
with
me
wearing
throughout
an
exalted
expression
of
ineffable
bliss
and
introducing
a
bewildering
variety
of
unexpected
halts
crouchings
and
saggings
of
the
knees
when
in
the
midst
of
an
interval
he
came
flying
to
daphne
calling
her
mother
insisting
that
he
had
been
insulted
demanding
to
be
taken
home
forthwith
and
finally
burying
his
face
in
her
shoulder
and
bursting
into
tears
when
during
supper
with
a
becoming
diffidence
he
took
his
stand
upon
a
chair
and
said
a
few
words
about
his
nursing
experiences
in
mesopotamia
and
spoke
with
emotion
of
the
happy
hours
he
had
spent
as
a
of
the
women
police
then
it
became
manifest
that
my
construction
of
the
laws
of
hospitality
had
set
up
such
a
new
record
of
generosity
as
few
if
any
of
those
present
would
ever
see
broken
oh
and
the
flies
you
know
the
way
they
flew
oh
it
was
dreadful
and
of
course
no
lipstick
would
stick
my
dears
i
was
simply
terrified
to
look
in
the
biscuit
box
and
then
we
had
to
wash
in
bits
so
embarrassing
talk
about
divisional
reserve
and
they
were
so
strict
with
it
all
only
ten
little
minutes
late
on
parade
and
you
got
it
where
auntie
wore
the
i
lost
my
temper
once
to
be
sworn
at
like
a
just
because
one
day
i
could
find
my
and
when
he
quite
finished
the
colonel
asked
me
what
powder
was
for
i
just
looked
round
and
gave
him
some
of
his
own
back
dam
your
pores
with
i
said
it
was
past
three
before
our
departure
was
sped
comfortably
weary
we
reached
our
own
villa
door
to
make
the
grisly
discovery
that
no
one
had
remembered
the
key
there
was
no
knocker
a
feeble
electric
bell
signalled
out
distress
to
a
deserted
basement
the
servants
were
asleep
upon
the
second
floor
after
we
had
all
reviled
berry
and
in
return
been
denounced
as
gang
of
accused
of
and
compared
to
and
vultures
about
a
weary
bull
we
began
to
shout
and
throw
stones
at
the
windows
perhaps
because
their
shutters
were
closed
our
labour
was
lost
to
complete
our
disgust
for
some
mysterious
reason
nobby
refused
to
bark
and
so
sound
the
alarm
in
the
ordinary
way
the
sealyham
was
used
to
give
tongue
whatever
the
hour
and
no
matter
what
indignation
he
might
excite
upon
the
slightest
provocation
this
morning
we
perambulated
the
curtilage
of
the
villa
alternately
yelling
like
demoniacs
and
mewing
like
cats
without
the
slightest
result
eventually
it
was
decided
that
one
of
us
must
effect
an
entrance
by
climbing
on
to
the
balcony
of
my
sister
room
jonah
had
a
game
leg
the
inflexibility
of
my
pantaloons
put
any
acrobatics
out
of
the
question
berry
action
at
any
rate
was
more
than
usually
unrestricted
moreover
it
was
berry
whom
we
had
expected
to
produce
the
key
it
became
necessary
to
elaborate
these
simple
facts
and
to
indicate
most
definitely
the
moral
which
they
were
pointing
before
my
was
able
to
grasp
the
one
or
to
appreciate
the
other
and
when
it
had
been
as
they
say
borne
in
upon
him
that
he
was
for
the
high
jump
another
ten
minutes
were
wasted
while
he
made
one
final
frantic
solitary
endeavour
to
attract
the
servants
attention
his
feminine
personality
discarded
he
raved
about
the
house
barking
screeching
and
braying
to
beat
the
band
he
thundered
upon
the
door
with
his
fists
he
flung
much
of
the
drive
in
the
direction
of
the
second
floor
finally
when
we
were
weak
with
laughter
he
sat
down
upon
the
steps
expressed
his
great
satisfaction
at
the
reception
of
his
efforts
to
amuse
and
assured
us
that
his
which
we
should
shortly
witness
would
be
still
more
diverting
by
now
it
was
a
quarter
to
four
and
so
soon
as
jonah
and
i
could
control
our
emotion
we
took
our
deliverer
by
the
arms
and
showed
him
best
way
up
he
listened
attentively
at
length
thanks
very
much
he
said
weakly
let
just
go
over
it
again
shall
i
just
to
be
sure
i
got
it
cold
first
i
swarm
up
that
pillar
good
i
may
say
i
never
have
swarmed
i
never
knew
anybody
did
swarm
except
bees
or
people
coming
out
of
a
football
match
never
mind
then
i
get
hold
of
the
gutter
and
draw
myself
up
with
my
hands
while
continuing
to
swarm
with
my
legs
if
if
the
gutter
will
stand
my
weight
of
course
that
easily
ascertained
i
just
try
it
if
it
will
it
does
if
it
wo
i
should
like
a
machine
erected
in
my
memory
outside
the
english
club
yes
i
got
that
well
if
it
will
i
work
i
think
you
said
round
until
i
can
reach
the
the
drain
will
enable
me
to
get
my
feet
into
the
gutter
sounds
all
right
does
it
will
enable
a
cryptic
phrase
quite
the
touch
where
were
we
oh
yes
the
having
enabled
me
i
just
fall
forward
on
to
the
tiles
when
my
hands
will
encounter
and
grasp
the
balustrade
then
i
climb
over
and
pat
nobby
yes
except
for
the
cesspool
i
mean
the
interlude
it
too
easy
we
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
we
watched
his
reduction
of
the
pillar
with
trembling
lips
we
heard
his
commentary
upon
gutters
and
those
who
make
them
with
shaking
shoulders
but
it
was
when
with
one
foot
in
the
air
and
the
other
wedged
behind
the
the
english
rose
spoke
of
the
uncertainty
of
life
and
inquired
if
we
believed
in
hell
when
after
an
exhausting
and
finally
successful
effort
to
get
his
left
knee
into
the
gutter
he
first
knelt
upon
a
spare
tile
to
his
wounding
and
then
found
that
his
right
foot
was
inextricably
wedged
between
the
and
the
wall
when
as
a
result
of
his
struggles
a
section
of
the
came
away
in
his
hand
so
that
he
was
left
clinging
to
the
gutter
with
one
foot
in
the
air
and
twelve
feet
of
piping
swaying
in
his
arms
then
our
control
gave
way
and
we
let
ourselves
run
before
a
tempest
of
homeric
laughter
we
clasped
one
another
we
leaned
against
walls
we
stamped
upon
the
ground
we
fought
for
breath
tears
streamed
from
our
eyes
all
the
time
in
a
loud
militant
voice
berry
spoke
of
building
and
architects
and
mountain
goats
of
france
and
of
the
french
of
incitement
to
suicide
of
inquests
and
the
law
of
skunks
and
leprosy
and
finally
of
his
descent
when
we
told
him
tearfully
to
drop
he
let
out
the
laugh
of
a
maniac
yes
he
said
uncertainly
to
tell
you
the
truth
that
solution
had
already
occurred
to
me
it
been
occurring
to
me
vividly
ever
since
i
began
but
i
against
it
it
is
that
i
afraid
but
i
want
something
more
difficult
oh
and
do
say
round
the
gutter
first
because
it
bad
english
and
secondly
because
no
man
born
of
woman
could
round
this
conduit
with
a
hundredweight
of
round
his
neck
what
i
want
is
a
definite
instruction
which
is
neither
murderous
nor
futile
burn
it
you
handed
me
enough
slush
when
i
was
rising
why
the
hell
ca
you
slobber
out
something
to
help
me
down
by
the
time
his
descent
was
accomplished
it
was
past
four
summer
time
and
there
was
a
pale
cast
about
the
sweet
moonlight
that
told
of
the
coming
of
another
dawn
i
say
said
jill
suddenly
do
let
go
to
bed
no
do
let
said
berry
with
a
hysterical
laugh
let
absolutely
refuse
jill
went
on
breathlessly
let
go
for
a
run
towards
lourdes
and
see
the
sun
rise
over
the
mountains
our
first
impulse
was
to
denounce
the
idea
upon
examination
however
its
hidden
value
emerged
we
were
sick
and
tired
of
trying
to
wake
the
servants
to
effect
an
entrance
was
seemingly
out
of
the
question
to
spend
another
two
hours
wandering
about
the
garden
or
wooing
slumber
in
the
cars
was
not
at
all
to
our
liking
finally
we
decided
that
since
we
should
be
back
before
the
world
proper
was
astir
our
appearance
if
it
was
noticed
at
all
would
but
afford
a
few
peasants
an
experience
which
they
could
relate
with
relish
for
many
years
and
that
since
the
sky
was
cloudless
so
convenient
an
occasion
of
observing
a
very
famous
effect
should
not
be
rejected
five
minutes
later
ping
and
pong
slid
silently
under
the
pont
oscar
ii
and
so
down
a
winding
hill
out
of
the
sleeping
town
and
on
to
the
bizanos
road
our
headlights
were
powerful
the
road
was
not
too
bad
and
the
world
was
empty
i
let
jonah
who
was
leading
get
well
away
and
then
gave
the
car
her
head
well
as
we
knew
it
our
way
seemed
unfamiliar
we
saw
the
countryside
as
through
a
glass
darkly
a
shadowy
file
of
poplars
a
grey
promise
of
meadowland
a
sable
thicket
far
in
the
distance
a
great
blurred
mass
rearing
a
sombre
head
a
chain
of
silent
villages
seemingly
twined
about
our
road
and
once
in
a
long
while
the
broad
brave
flash
of
laughing
water
these
and
their
ghostly
like
made
up
our
changing
neighbourhood
then
came
a
link
in
the
chain
that
even
wizard
night
could
not
transfigure
sweet
storied
coarraze
fencing
our
way
with
its
peculiar
pride
of
church
and
state
three
miles
ahead
hoary
bétharram
defender
of
the
faith
lent
us
its
famous
bridge
at
the
toll
of
a
turn
of
which
no
manner
of
moonshine
can
cheat
the
memory
we
were
nearing
lourdes
now
but
there
was
no
sign
of
jonah
i
began
to
wonder
whether
my
cousin
was
faring
farther
afield
it
was
so
lourdes
is
a
of
the
pyrenees
it
was
clear
that
my
sister
and
cousins
had
threaded
its
echoing
porch
their
way
was
good
enough
for
us
we
swung
to
the
right
dived
into
and
out
of
the
sleeping
town
and
flung
up
the
pale
thin
road
that
heads
for
spain
it
was
when
we
had
slipped
through
argelès
and
jonah
was
still
before
us
that
we
knew
that
if
we
would
catch
him
we
must
climb
to
gavarnie
the
daylight
was
waxing
now
and
when
we
came
to
pierrefitte
i
switched
off
the
lights
there
is
a
gorge
in
the
mountains
some
seven
miles
long
it
is
i
think
nature
boudoir
its
tall
steep
walls
are
hung
with
foliage
a
trembling
precious
arras
which
spring
will
so
emblazon
with
her
spruce
heraldry
that
every
blowing
rod
breathes
a
refreshing
madrigal
its
floor
is
a
busy
torrent
fretting
its
everlasting
way
by
wet
grey
rocks
the
vivid
green
of
ferns
and
now
and
again
a
little
patch
of
greensward
a
tender
lawn
for
baby
elves
to
play
on
here
is
a
green
shelf
ladies
stuck
all
with
cowslips
and
there
another
radiant
with
peering
daffodils
in
this
recess
sweet
violets
grow
look
at
that
royal
gallery
it
is
fraught
with
crocuses
laden
with
purple
and
gold
gentians
and
buttercups
too
have
their
own
nurseries
but
one
thing
more
this
gorge
is
full
of
fountains
they
are
its
especial
glory
all
the
beauty
in
the
world
of
falling
water
is
here
exhibited
tremendous
falls
go
thundering
long
slender
tresses
of
water
plunge
from
a
dizzy
height
lose
by
the
way
their
symmetry
presently
vanish
into
sparkling
smoke
cascades
with
a
delicate
flourish
leap
from
ledge
to
ledge
stout
heads
of
crystal
well
bubbling
out
of
earth
elegant
springs
flash
musically
into
their
brimming
basins
of
the
living
rock
the
mistress
of
this
shining
court
is
very
beautiful
a
bank
is
overhanging
a
little
dell
as
the
eaves
of
an
old
house
lean
out
to
shelter
half
a
pavement
as
eaves
too
are
thatched
so
the
brown
bank
is
clad
with
emerald
moss
from
the
edge
of
the
moss
dangles
a
silver
fringe
each
gleaming
twisted
cord
of
it
hangs
separate
and
distinct
save
when
a
breath
of
wind
plaits
two
or
three
into
a
transient
tassel
the
fringe
is
the
waterfall
enchanted
with
such
a
fairyland
we
lingered
so
long
over
our
passage
that
we
only
reached
gavarnie
with
a
handful
of
moments
to
spare
as
we
had
expected
here
were
the
others
a
little
apart
from
the
car
their
eyes
lifted
to
the
ethereal
terraces
of
the
majestic
cirque
the
east
was
afire
with
splendour
all
the
blue
dome
of
sky
was
blushing
only
the
earth
was
dull
suddenly
the
topmost
turret
of
the
frozen
battlements
burst
into
rosy
flame
one
by
tremendous
one
we
saw
the
high
places
of
the
world
suffer
their
king
salute
little
wonder
that
witnessing
so
sublime
a
ceremony
we
forgot
all
time
the
sudden
clack
of
shutters
flung
back
against
a
wall
brought
us
to
earth
with
a
jar
we
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
from
the
window
of
a
cottage
some
seventy
paces
away
a
woman
was
regarding
us
steadily
we
the
cars
with
more
precipitation
than
dignity
a
glance
at
the
clock
in
the
dashboard
made
my
heart
sink
a
quarter
past
six
summer
time
it
was
clear
that
gavarnie
was
lazy
argelès
lourdes
and
the
rest
must
be
already
bustling
long
ere
we
could
reach
pau
the
business
of
town
and
country
would
be
in
full
swing
the
same
reflection
i
imagine
had
bitten
jonah
for
as
i
let
in
the
clutch
ping
swept
past
us
and
whipped
into
the
village
with
a
low
snarl
fast
as
we
went
we
never
saw
him
again
that
memorable
morning
jonah
must
have
gone
like
the
wind
as
for
us
we
wasted
no
time
we
leapt
through
the
village
dropped
down
the
curling
pass
snarled
through
left
luz
staring
and
sailed
into
argelès
as
it
was
striking
seven
from
argelès
to
lourdes
is
over
eight
miles
it
was
when
we
had
covered
exactly
four
of
these
in
six
minutes
that
the
engine
stuttered
sighed
and
then
just
fainted
away
we
had
run
out
of
petrol
this
was
annoying
but
not
a
serious
matter
for
there
was
a
can
on
the
step
the
two
gallons
it
was
containing
would
easily
bring
us
to
pau
what
was
much
more
annoying
and
of
considerable
moment
was
that
the
can
when
examined
proved
to
be
dry
as
a
bone
after
a
moment
consideration
of
the
unsavoury
prospect
so
suddenly
unveiled
i
straightened
my
back
pushed
my
ridiculous
hat
to
the
nape
of
my
neck
and
took
out
a
adèle
and
berry
stared
that
right
said
the
latter
bitterly
take
your
blinking
time
why
do
you
sit
down
on
the
bank
and
put
your
feet
up
i
felt
for
a
match
finger
to
lip
adèle
leaned
forward
for
heaven
sake
she
cried
do
say
there
none
in
the
can
my
darling
said
i
you
spoken
the
naked
truth
there
was
a
long
silence
the
gush
of
a
neighbouring
spring
was
suggesting
a
simple
peace
we
could
not
share
suddenly
help
shrieked
the
english
rose
help
i
being
compromised
so
soon
as
we
could
induce
him
to
hold
his
tongue
a
council
was
held
presently
it
was
decided
that
i
must
return
to
argelès
if
possible
procure
a
car
and
bring
some
petrol
back
as
fast
as
i
could
already
the
day
was
growing
extremely
hot
and
unless
i
encountered
a
driver
who
would
give
me
a
lift
it
seemed
unlikely
that
i
should
be
back
within
an
hour
and
a
half
we
had
of
course
no
hope
of
salvation
help
that
arrived
now
would
be
too
late
lourdes
would
be
teeming
the
trivial
round
of
pau
would
be
in
full
blast
the
possible
passage
of
another
car
would
spare
us
me
particularly
some
ignominy
but
that
was
all
it
was
arranged
that
should
a
car
appear
after
i
had
passed
out
of
sight
the
driver
should
be
accosted
haply
deprived
of
petrol
and
certainly
dispatched
in
my
pursuit
finally
we
closed
pong
and
feeling
extremely
and
unpleasantly
hot
i
buttoned
my
overcoat
about
me
and
set
out
for
argelès
the
memory
of
that
walk
will
stay
with
me
till
i
die
if
a
few
hours
before
i
had
been
satisfied
that
seldom
sat
down
i
was
soon
in
possession
of
most
convincing
evidence
that
come
what
might
they
never
did
more
than
stroll
the
pantaloons
indeed
curtailed
every
pace
i
took
it
also
became
painfully
obvious
that
their
was
intended
for
use
only
upon
tiled
pavements
or
parquet
and
since
the
surface
of
the
road
to
argelès
was
bearing
a
closer
resemblance
to
the
bed
of
a
torrent
i
suffered
accordingly
what
service
their
headgear
in
any
conceivable
circumstances
could
have
rendered
i
can
not
pretend
to
say
as
a
protection
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
it
was
singularly
futile
had
i
been
wearing
flannels
i
should
have
been
sweltering
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
dressed
as
i
was
i
was
streaming
with
honest
sweat
in
less
than
five
minutes
before
i
had
covered
half
a
mile
i
tore
off
my
overcoat
and
flung
it
behind
a
wall
my
reception
at
the
first
hamlet
i
reached
was
hardly
promising
the
honour
of
appreciating
my
presence
before
anyone
else
fell
to
a
pair
of
bullocks
attached
to
a
wain
piled
high
with
wood
and
proceeding
slowly
in
the
direction
of
lourdes
had
they
perceived
an
apparition
shaking
a
bloody
goad
they
could
not
have
acted
with
more
concerted
or
devastating
rapidity
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
they
had
made
a
complete
the
waggon
was
lying
on
its
side
across
the
fairway
and
its
burden
of
logs
had
been
distributed
with
a
dull
crash
upon
about
a
square
perch
of
cobbles
had
i
announced
my
coming
by
tuck
of
drum
i
could
not
have
attracted
more
instant
and
faithful
attention
before
the
explosion
of
agony
with
which
the
driver
till
then
walking
as
usual
some
thirty
paces
in
rear
had
greeted
the
catastrophe
had
turned
into
a
roaring
torrent
of
abuse
every
man
woman
and
child
within
earshot
came
clattering
upon
the
scene
for
a
moment
standing
to
one
side
beneath
the
shelter
of
a
flight
of
steps
i
escaped
notice
it
was
at
least
appropriate
that
the
luckless
waggoner
should
have
been
the
first
to
perceive
me
at
the
actual
moment
of
observation
he
was
at
once
indicating
the
disposition
of
his
wood
with
a
gesture
charged
with
the
savage
despair
of
a
barbaric
age
and
letting
out
a
screech
which
threatened
to
curdle
the
blood
the
gesture
collapsed
the
screech
died
on
his
lips
with
dropped
jaw
and
bulging
eyes
the
fellow
backed
to
the
wall
when
i
stepped
forward
he
put
the
waggon
between
us
i
never
remember
so
poignant
a
silence
beneath
the
merciless
scrutiny
of
those
forty
pairs
of
eyes
i
seemed
to
touch
the
very
bottom
of
abashment
then
i
lifted
my
ridiculous
hat
and
cleared
my
throat
good
day
i
said
cheerfully
speaking
in
french
i
on
my
way
back
from
a
ball
a
ball
and
my
car
has
run
out
of
petrol
i
want
to
hire
a
cart
to
go
to
argelès
if
i
had
said
i
wanted
to
hire
a
my
simple
statement
could
not
have
been
more
apathetically
received
happily
for
some
unobvious
reason
no
one
seemed
to
associate
me
with
the
bullocks
waywardness
but
it
took
me
ten
minutes
cajolery
to
elicit
the
address
of
a
peasant
who
might
hire
me
a
cart
at
last
i
was
told
his
lodging
and
pointed
the
way
such
direction
proved
supererogatory
first
because
we
all
moved
off
together
and
secondly
because
it
subsequently
transpired
that
the
gentleman
whom
i
was
seeking
was
already
present
but
that
is
france
upon
arrival
at
his
house
my
friend
stepped
out
of
the
ruck
and
with
the
utmost
composure
asked
if
it
was
true
that
i
was
desiring
to
be
driven
to
argelès
controlling
my
indignation
i
replied
with
equal
gravity
that
such
was
my
urgent
ambition
taking
a
from
my
pocket
i
added
that
upon
reaching
a
garage
at
argelès
i
would
deduct
the
time
we
had
taken
from
half
an
hour
and
cheerfully
give
him
a
franc
for
every
minute
that
was
left
i
can
only
suppose
that
so
novel
a
method
of
payment
aroused
his
suspicion
be
that
as
it
may
with
an
apologetic
bow
the
fellow
requested
to
see
the
colour
of
my
money
then
and
then
only
did
i
remember
that
i
had
not
a
brass
farthing
upon
my
person
what
was
worse
i
felt
pretty
sure
that
adèle
and
berry
were
equally
penniless
my
exit
from
that
village
i
try
to
forget
i
found
that
the
waters
of
humiliation
were
deeper
than
i
could
have
believed
they
seemed
in
fact
bottomless
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
to
say
that
i
returned
by
the
way
i
had
come
i
had
had
enough
of
the
road
to
argelès
my
one
idea
was
to
rejoin
adèle
and
berry
and
to
sit
down
in
the
car
mentally
and
physically
i
was
weary
to
death
i
craved
to
set
my
back
against
the
buttress
of
company
in
this
misfortune
and
i
was
mad
to
sit
down
compared
with
standing
any
longer
upon
my
feet
the
contingency
of
dislocation
became
positively
attractive
the
first
thing
that
met
my
eyes
as
i
limped
round
the
last
of
the
bends
was
the
bonnet
of
a
dilapidated
touring
car
i
could
have
thrown
up
my
rotten
hat
a
few
feet
further
from
lourdes
than
pong
himself
was
an
aged
grey
french
car
standing
in
the
white
road
between
the
two
was
a
strapping
figure
in
pale
pink
georgette
and
a
large
leghorn
hat
apparently
arguing
with
three
mechanics
from
pong
window
the
conical
hat
and
extravagant
ruff
of
were
protruding
excitedly
my
companions
relief
to
see
me
again
was
unfeigned
as
i
came
up
adèle
gave
a
whimper
of
delight
and
a
moment
later
she
was
pouring
her
tale
into
my
ears
you
had
been
gone
long
when
these
people
came
by
we
stopped
them
of
course
and
one
moment
said
i
have
they
got
any
petrol
listen
said
berry
four
of
what
they
had
are
in
our
tank
it
was
when
they
were
in
that
we
found
we
had
a
bean
that
matter
the
gents
were
perfectly
happy
to
take
my
address
a
pencil
was
produced
we
had
nothing
of
course
and
i
started
to
write
it
all
down
on
the
edge
of
yesterday
they
all
looked
over
my
shoulder
as
i
was
writing
i
their
manner
change
i
stopped
and
looked
round
fools
were
staring
at
me
as
if
i
were
risen
from
the
that
may
surprise
you
but
it
did
me
because
got
through
that
phase
for
a
moment
we
looked
at
one
another
then
one
picked
up
the
paper
and
took
off
his
hat
is
unnecessary
he
said
to
give
us
his
name
we
know
it
perfectly
the
others
nodded
agreement
i
tell
you
i
thought
they
gone
mad
he
pushed
his
hat
back
from
his
eyes
and
sat
down
on
the
step
but
but
what
the
trouble
i
gasped
berry
threw
out
his
hands
have
you
got
it
he
said
think
i
sycamore
i
soon
perceived
the
vanity
of
argument
with
my
in
the
hand
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
the
bush
the
three
mechanics
were
inexorable
they
accepted
my
statements
they
saw
my
point
of
view
they
uncovered
they
bowed
they
laughed
when
i
laughed
they
admitted
the
possibility
nay
likelihood
of
a
mistake
they
deplored
the
inconvenience
we
were
suffering
but
politely
and
firmly
they
insisted
that
berry
should
enter
their
car
and
accompany
them
to
lourdes
that
this
their
demand
should
be
met
was
not
to
be
thought
of
adèle
and
i
could
not
desert
berry
from
the
police
at
lourdes
nothing
was
to
be
expected
but
suspicion
hostility
and
maddeningly
officious
delays
berry
eventual
release
would
only
be
obtained
at
a
cost
of
such
publicity
as
made
my
head
swim
any
idea
of
force
was
out
of
the
question
but
for
the
presence
of
my
wife
we
would
have
done
what
we
could
with
adèle
in
our
care
however
we
could
not
afford
to
fail
and
they
were
three
to
two
i
racked
my
brain
desperately
presently
one
of
the
trio
lugged
out
a
watch
when
he
showed
his
fellows
the
hour
they
flung
up
their
arms
a
moment
later
they
were
clearing
for
action
was
carefully
folded
and
stuffed
out
of
sight
berry
was
informed
with
a
bow
that
so
soon
as
their
car
was
turned
round
they
would
be
ready
to
leave
the
slightest
of
the
three
stepped
to
the
the
next
moment
with
a
deafening
roar
their
engine
was
under
way
i
was
standing
with
my
hand
upon
our
off
hind
wing
and
as
the
driver
ran
to
his
throttle
i
felt
a
steady
tremor
cover
of
the
other
car
roar
adèle
had
started
pong
what
was
a
great
deal
more
had
given
me
my
i
thought
like
lightning
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
already
the
driver
was
in
his
seat
and
fumbling
with
his
as
slowly
as
i
dared
i
strolled
to
the
door
adèle
and
my
eyes
met
when
you
hear
me
say
i
said
with
the
faintest
smile
stared
through
the
i
returned
to
the
rear
of
the
car
the
way
we
were
using
was
narrow
but
fifty
paces
away
in
the
direction
of
argelès
was
a
track
which
left
our
road
to
lead
to
a
farm
for
this
spot
the
driver
was
making
there
he
would
be
able
to
turn
with
the
acme
of
ease
his
two
companions
were
standing
close
to
berry
as
luck
would
have
it
the
latter
was
standing
with
his
back
to
our
car
perhaps
a
foot
from
the
not
one
of
the
three
i
fancy
had
any
idea
that
our
engine
was
running
i
addressed
the
mechanics
in
french
i
have
been
talking
with
and
tired
as
she
is
she
agrees
that
it
will
be
best
if
we
follow
you
to
lourdes
please
do
go
too
fast
when
you
get
to
the
town
or
we
shall
lose
our
way
as
they
assured
me
of
their
service
i
turned
to
berry
as
though
to
translate
what
i
had
said
there
are
two
steps
to
the
dickey
the
lower
one
is
two
paces
to
your
right
and
one
to
your
rear
it
is
not
meant
for
a
seat
but
it
will
do
throw
your
arm
round
the
spare
wheels
and
sit
tight
berry
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
glance
up
the
road
showed
me
the
other
car
being
turned
into
the
track
i
crossed
to
the
near
side
of
pong
and
stooped
as
though
to
examine
the
exhaust
the
two
mechanics
were
watching
me
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
i
saw
berry
glance
behind
him
sink
down
upon
the
step
drop
his
head
miserably
into
the
crook
of
his
arm
and
set
that
arm
upon
the
spare
wheels
suddenly
i
straightened
my
back
glanced
past
the
two
warders
and
flung
out
a
pointing
arm
i
shouted
and
stepped
on
to
the
as
i
spoke
adèle
let
in
the
clutch
it
was
really
too
easy
by
the
time
our
two
friends
had
decided
to
turn
and
inquire
what
had
excited
my
remark
we
were
ten
paces
away
and
gathering
speed
of
course
they
ran
after
us
yelling
like
men
possessed
that
was
but
human
then
they
recovered
their
wits
and
raced
for
their
car
i
cried
to
berry
to
sit
tight
and
opened
the
door
is
he
on
said
adèle
as
i
took
my
seat
by
her
side
i
nodded
as
soon
as
we
far
enough
on
we
must
take
him
inside
he
ought
to
be
safe
enough
but
i
bet
he
blessing
his
petticoats
as
for
you
sweetheart
i
do
know
which
is
the
finer
your
nerve
or
your
wit
a
cool
hand
stole
into
mine
then
but
we
not
there
yet
said
adèle
this
was
unhappily
true
pong
was
the
faster
car
and
adèle
was
already
going
the
deuce
of
a
pace
but
there
was
traffic
to
come
and
two
level
crossings
lay
between
us
and
lourdes
i
turned
and
looked
out
of
the
glass
in
the
back
of
the
hood
the
english
rose
had
thrust
herself
inelegantly
on
to
the
petrol
tank
her
right
foot
was
jammed
against
a
wing
so
that
her
shapely
leg
acted
as
a
brace
her
arms
clasped
the
two
spare
wheels
convulsively
her
head
was
thrown
back
and
her
lips
were
moving
of
our
pursuers
there
was
no
sign
that
moment
we
had
rounded
a
bend
but
when
a
moment
later
we
rounded
another
they
were
still
out
of
sight
i
began
to
wonder
whether
it
was
safe
to
stop
and
take
berry
inboard
then
the
klaxon
belched
and
a
cry
from
adèle
made
me
turn
two
hundred
yards
ahead
was
a
flock
of
sheep
all
over
the
road
we
had
to
slow
down
to
a
pace
which
jabbed
at
my
nerves
i
did
not
know
what
to
do
i
did
not
know
whether
to
seize
the
chance
and
take
berry
inside
or
whether
to
put
the
obstacle
between
pong
and
the
terror
behind
and
i
felt
i
must
look
at
the
sheep
the
speedometer
dropped
to
twenty
to
fifteen
to
ten
then
the
tires
tore
at
the
road
and
we
practically
stopped
adèle
changed
into
second
speed
i
opened
the
door
instantly
only
to
see
that
to
collect
berry
now
was
out
of
the
question
the
sheep
were
all
round
us
like
a
flood
lapping
our
sides
adèle
changed
into
first
i
was
physically
afraid
to
look
behind
the
next
moment
we
were
through
we
stormed
round
a
curve
to
see
a
level
crossing
a
quarter
of
a
mile
ahead
gates
were
adèle
gave
a
cry
of
despair
oh
boy
we
done
not
yet
said
i
opening
the
door
again
go
right
up
to
them
lass
at
least
it
give
us
a
chance
to
get
berry
inside
we
stopped
with
a
jerk
three
feet
from
the
rails
as
i
ran
for
the
gate
i
glanced
over
my
shoulder
now
your
chance
i
shouted
get
i
never
completed
the
sentence
english
rose
was
i
stopped
still
in
my
tracks
then
i
rushed
back
to
the
car
he
gone
i
cried
we
dropped
him
quick
reverse
up
the
way
we
come
for
all
you
worth
adèle
backed
the
car
with
the
speed
and
skill
of
a
professional
i
stood
on
the
straining
my
eyes
the
next
moment
a
dilapidated
touring
car
tore
round
the
bend
we
were
approaching
and
leapt
towards
us
it
passed
us
with
locked
wheels
rocking
to
glory
at
a
nod
from
me
adèle
threw
out
the
clutch
as
the
mechanics
came
up
i
sorry
i
said
but
i
fear
you
passed
him
no
he
not
here
pray
look
in
the
car
quite
satisfied
good
yes
we
dropped
him
a
long
way
back
we
thought
it
wiser
with
that
i
wished
them
day
and
climbed
into
our
car
but
what
shall
we
do
said
adèle
get
home
said
i
as
quick
as
ever
we
can
so
long
as
we
stay
hereabouts
those
fellows
stick
to
us
like
glue
we
must
go
and
get
help
and
come
back
berry
hide
somewhere
where
he
can
watch
the
road
as
we
passed
over
the
level
crossing
i
looked
behind
the
dilapidated
grey
car
was
being
turned
round
feverishly
minutes
later
we
sped
up
the
shadowy
drive
and
stopped
by
our
own
front
door
switched
off
the
engine
and
sat
looking
miserably
before
her
i
wish
she
said
slowly
i
wish
you
let
me
go
with
you
i
did
hate
leaving
him
so
and
i
feel
with
a
hand
on
the
door
i
touched
her
pale
cheek
my
darling
said
i
you
done
more
than
your
bit
far
more
and
you
going
straight
to
bed
as
for
leaving
him
well
you
know
how
much
i
liked
it
but
i
know
when
i
done
the
last
rose
of
summer
left
blooming
alone
delivered
with
obvious
emotion
in
a
muffled
baritone
voice
famous
words
seemed
to
come
from
beneath
us
adèle
and
i
stared
at
one
another
with
starting
eyes
then
i
fell
out
of
the
car
and
clawed
at
the
flap
of
the
dickey
my
hands
were
trembling
but
i
had
it
open
at
last
her
head
pillowed
upon
a
spare
tube
the
ruin
of
english
regarded
me
coyly
i
think
you
might
have
knocked
she
said
simpering
supposing
been
chapter
xii
how
a
telegram
came
for
jill
piers
demanded
his
sweetheart
and
i
drove
after
my
wife
darling
jill
all
finished
now
and
i
can
start
for
paris
i
must
stay
there
one
night
to
sign
some
papers
and
then
i
can
leave
for
pau
and
on
next
sunday
morning
as
ever
is
we
have
breakfast
together
perhaps
no
i
wo
say
it
any
way
sunday
morning
at
latest
everyone
been
awfully
kind
and
you
never
guess
coming
cousin
leslie
turned
out
a
white
man
he
the
one
you
know
who
brought
the
suit
the
day
i
got
back
from
irikli
i
got
a
note
from
him
saying
that
while
he
could
pretend
he
was
sorry
he
lost
his
case
he
knew
how
to
take
a
beating
and
now
that
it
was
all
over
could
we
be
friends
and
asking
me
to
come
and
dine
with
him
and
his
wife
at
the
grand
hotel
old
vissochi
did
want
me
to
go
and
kept
quoting
something
out
of
virgil
about
the
greeks
but
of
course
i
insisted
and
i
am
so
glad
i
did
leslie
and
his
wife
were
simply
splendid
nobody
could
have
been
nicer
and
considering
that
if
he
won
he
had
the
title
estates
money
and
everything
i
think
it
speaks
jolly
well
for
them
both
got
two
ripping
little
boys
and
they
were
frightfully
interested
to
hear
about
you
they
no
idea
of
course
but
i
just
had
to
tell
them
they
were
so
astonished
at
first
they
could
hardly
speak
and
then
trunk
picked
up
her
glass
and
cried
out
hurray
hurray
and
they
both
drank
to
us
both
and
everybody
was
staring
and
leslie
got
quite
red
with
embarrassment
at
their
having
made
such
a
scene
then
they
made
me
tell
them
what
you
looked
like
and
i
did
my
best
and
they
laughed
and
said
i
was
caking
it
on
so
i
showed
them
your
photograph
and
then
trunk
made
me
show
her
a
letter
of
yours
and
told
your
character
from
your
handwriting
and
we
had
a
great
time
oh
jill
i
longing
for
you
to
see
irikli
of
course
i
love
rome
but
i
think
we
have
to
be
at
como
a
lot
father
always
liked
it
the
best
and
i
think
you
will
it
so
lovely
it
makes
you
want
to
shout
it
only
wants
a
princess
with
golden
hair
to
make
it
fairyland
and
now
it
going
to
have
one
oh
my
darling
i
just
living
to
see
your
beautiful
face
again
and
your
great
grave
grey
eyes
jill
have
you
any
idea
what
wonderful
eyes
you
got
i
say
we
are
going
to
be
happy
are
we
so
happy
we
sha
have
time
for
anything
else
but
i
ca
wear
a
dear
not
after
this
i
promised
i
would
till
i
came
back
but
i
almost
melted
i
do
think
jonah
can
be
right
any
way
i
bet
he
does
wear
very
loving
my
cousin
showed
us
the
letter
with
the
artless
confidence
of
a
child
excepting
herself
i
do
think
any
one
of
us
shared
the
enthusiasm
about
leslie
trunk
we
quite
agreed
with
signer
vissochi
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
the
man
who
had
instituted
such
an
iniquitous
suit
could
so
swiftly
forgive
the
costly
drubbing
he
had
received
or
as
to
the
dukedom
honestly
welcome
the
news
of
piers
engagement
sweetheart
jill
however
knew
little
of
leopards
and
their
spots
out
of
respect
for
such
unconsciousness
we
held
our
peace
there
was
no
hurry
and
piers
could
be
tackled
at
our
convenience
the
conversation
turned
to
our
impending
departure
from
france
i
take
it
said
jonah
that
we
go
as
we
came
if
we
going
to
paris
for
the
grand
prix
there
not
much
object
in
stopping
there
now
in
any
event
it
mean
our
going
by
train
and
sending
the
cars
by
sea
i
not
going
to
drive
in
paris
for
anyone
i
too
old
after
a
little
discussion
we
decided
that
he
was
right
same
route
said
adèle
i
think
so
said
jonah
except
that
we
miss
bordeaux
and
go
by
bergerac
instead
is
that
shorter
or
longer
said
berry
not
that
i
really
care
because
i
would
visit
bordeaux
a
second
time
for
any
earthly
consideration
i
seen
a
good
many
poisonous
places
in
my
time
but
for
inducing
the
concentrated
essence
of
depression
that
spectre
of
bustling
commerce
has
them
as
the
immortal
says
beat
to
a
i
do
seem
to
remember
said
daphne
that
it
was
so
awful
it
was
said
i
but
the
circumstances
in
which
he
visited
it
were
somewhat
drab
still
it
not
an
attractive
town
and
as
the
other
way
shorter
and
the
road
about
twice
as
good
i
glad
it
shorter
said
berry
i
want
to
get
to
angoulême
in
good
time
why
said
jill
berry
eyed
her
reproachfully
child
he
said
is
your
gratitude
so
have
you
in
six
slight
months
forgotten
that
at
angoulême
we
were
given
the
very
finest
dinner
that
ever
we
ate
a
meal
without
frills
nine
tender
courses
long
for
which
we
paid
the
equivalent
of
rather
less
than
five
shillings
a
head
oh
i
remember
said
jill
that
was
where
they
made
us
use
the
same
knife
all
through
dinner
and
what
demanded
berry
of
that
a
conceit
a
charming
conceit
thus
was
the
glorious
tradition
of
one
course
handed
down
to
those
that
followed
after
i
tell
you
that
for
me
the
idea
of
another
hour
in
angoulême
goes
far
to
ameliorate
the
unpleasant
prospect
of
erupting
into
the
middle
of
an
english
spring
it
clear
said
i
that
you
should
do
a
gastronomic
tour
every
department
of
france
has
its
particular
dainty
with
a
reliable
list
an
almanac
and
a
motor
ambulance
you
could
do
wonders
my
groaned
it
would
work
he
said
miserably
it
would
work
clash
when
you
were
in
picardy
considering
some
de
you
get
a
wire
from
savoy
saying
that
the
salmon
trout
were
in
the
pink
and
on
the
way
there
you
get
another
from
gascony
to
say
that
in
hours
they
would
answer
for
the
flavour
of
the
ortolans
talking
of
gluttony
said
jonah
if
they
do
bring
lunch
pretty
soon
we
shall
be
late
it
past
one
now
and
the
meeting
the
other
side
of
morlaas
first
race
i
rose
and
strolled
to
the
to
see
the
steward
this
day
was
the
sixteenth
of
april
and
summer
was
coming
in
under
our
very
eyes
plain
woods
and
foothills
were
putting
on
amain
her
lovely
livery
we
had
played
a
full
round
of
golf
over
a
blowing
valley
we
hardly
knew
billowy
emerald
banks
masked
the
familiar
sparkle
of
the
hurrying
gave
the
fine
brown
lace
of
rising
woods
had
disappeared
and
in
its
stead
a
broad
hanging
terrace
of
delicate
green
stood
up
against
the
sky
from
being
a
jolly
counterpane
the
plain
of
billère
itself
had
become
a
cheerful
quilt
as
for
the
they
were
so
monstrously
tricked
out
with
fine
fresh
ruffles
and
unexpected
equipage
of
greenery
with
a
strange
epaulet
upon
that
shoulder
and
a
periwig
upon
that
brow
that
if
high
hills
but
hopped
outside
the
psalter
you
would
have
sworn
the
snowy
pyrenees
had
found
new
equerries
luncheon
was
served
indoors
throughout
the
winter
the
lawn
before
the
had
made
a
however
we
were
glad
of
the
shade
does
piers
know
said
adèle
that
he
coming
home
with
us
jill
shook
her
head
not
yet
i
meant
to
tell
him
in
my
last
letter
but
i
forgot
she
turned
to
daphne
you
do
think
we
could
be
married
at
once
sure
piers
would
mind
and
i
be
so
much
easier
he
does
want
looking
after
you
know
fancy
his
wanting
to
leave
off
that
belt
thing
yes
just
fancy
said
berry
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
was
a
present
from
you
it
be
indecent
it
is
that
said
jill
but
he
might
get
an
awful
chill
i
know
said
berry
i
know
that
my
second
point
keep
the
abdominal
wall
quarter
of
an
inch
deep
in
lamb
wool
and
in
the
hottest
weather
you
never
feel
cold
never
mind
if
he
mentions
it
again
we
make
its
retention
a
term
of
the
marriage
settlement
jill
eyed
him
severely
before
proceeding
it
could
be
quite
quiet
she
continued
the
wedding
i
mean
at
a
registry
place
hunt
for
instance
said
and
then
we
could
all
go
down
to
white
ladies
together
and
when
he
has
to
go
back
to
fix
things
up
in
italy
i
could
go
too
my
darling
said
daphne
do
you
want
to
be
married
from
home
in
our
own
old
church
at
bilberry
for
only
one
thing
if
you
were
i
do
think
the
village
would
ever
get
over
it
jill
sighed
when
you
talk
like
that
she
said
i
do
want
to
be
married
at
all
yes
i
do
i
want
piers
i
would
be
happy
without
him
but
if
only
he
had
got
four
estates
of
his
own
we
might
five
said
berry
jill
opened
her
big
grey
eyes
four
now
and
a
share
in
another
upon
his
wedding
day
jill
knitted
her
brow
i
never
knew
this
she
said
what
the
one
he
going
to
have
berry
raised
his
eyebrows
it
a
place
in
hampshire
he
said
not
very
far
from
brooch
they
call
it
white
ladies
the
look
which
jill
gave
us
as
we
acclaimed
his
words
came
straight
out
of
paradise
i
do
wish
he
could
have
heard
you
she
said
uncertainly
i
tell
him
of
course
but
it
wo
be
the
same
and
my
memory
really
i
forgotten
the
angoulême
dinner
but
i
forget
this
lunch
in
a
hundred
years
in
another
minute
said
berry
i
shall
imbrue
this
omelet
with
tears
then
it
be
too
salt
he
seized
his
tumbler
and
raised
it
above
his
head
i
give
you
monsieur
roland
may
he
touch
the
ground
in
spots
this
afternoon
five
times
he
lent
me
an
out
of
sheer
good
nature
his
taste
in
cocktails
is
venerable
and
whenever
i
see
him
he
asks
when
we
going
to
use
his
car
we
drank
the
toast
gladly
roland
was
a
good
sportsman
and
throughout
the
season
at
pau
he
had
been
more
than
friendly
he
was
to
ride
two
races
at
the
meeting
this
afternoon
and
now
said
i
get
a
move
on
jammes
is
ten
miles
off
and
the
road
is
vile
if
we
got
roland
flier
it
be
one
thing
but
ping
and
pong
take
their
own
time
my
frowned
business
first
he
said
shortly
business
first
i
spoke
to
the
steward
about
the
cutlets
and
i
wo
have
them
rushed
and
if
our
brie
on
the
sideboard
well
i
too
am
in
a
melting
mood
and
just
asking
for
trouble
there
was
a
fresh
breeze
quickening
the
air
upon
the
uplands
beyond
old
morlaas
to
whip
the
flags
into
a
steady
flutter
and
now
and
again
flick
a
dark
tress
of
hair
across
adèle
dear
cheeks
as
we
scrambled
across
country
why
oh
why
she
wailed
did
ever
i
let
it
grow
i
have
it
cut
again
i
swear
i
will
and
what
about
me
said
i
you
a
joint
tenant
with
me
you
ca
commit
waste
like
that
without
my
consent
i
sure
i
can
abate
is
that
right
a
nuisance
it
not
a
nuisance
it
a
glory
when
i
wake
up
in
the
morning
and
see
it
rippling
all
over
the
pillow
i
plume
myself
upon
my
real
and
personal
interest
in
such
a
beautiful
estate
then
i
start
working
out
how
many
lockets
it
fill
and
that
sends
me
to
sleep
again
does
it
really
ripple
said
adèle
or
is
that
a
poet
licence
rather
said
i
sometimes
if
i
half
asleep
i
feel
quite
seasick
adèle
smiled
thoughtfully
in
that
case
she
announced
i
reconsider
my
decision
but
i
wish
to
heaven
it
ripple
when
i
awake
they
off
cried
jonah
a
sudden
rush
for
the
bank
on
which
we
were
standing
confirmed
his
report
we
had
much
ado
to
escape
being
thrust
into
the
deep
lane
the
bank
was
walling
the
lane
was
about
a
mile
long
and
so
was
the
bank
the
latter
made
a
fair
grand
stand
as
such
it
was
packed
not
only
all
the
visitors
to
pau
but
every
single
peasant
for
twenty
miles
about
seemed
to
have
rallied
at
jammes
to
see
the
sport
the
regular
business
of
the
was
conspicuously
missing
pleasure
was
strolling
cock
of
an
empty
walk
for
sheer
bonhomie
the
little
meeting
bade
fair
to
throw
its
elder
brethren
of
the
hippodrome
itself
into
the
shadowy
distance
roland
rode
a
fine
race
and
won
by
a
neck
we
left
the
bank
and
walked
up
the
lane
to
offer
our
congratulations
thank
you
thank
you
but
nex
year
you
will
bring
horses
eh
we
will
ride
against
one
another
yes

keep
them
with
me
i
plenty
of
boxes

know
an
on
the
day
i
will
give
your
horse

breakfast
and
he
shall
give
me

race

right
when

tank
i

for
a
week

when

come
back
yesterday
i
ask
my
people

captain
pleydell
enjoyed

used
it
then
that
is
because
the
major

not
been

not
good
enough
i
tell

am
hurt
i
shall
not
ask
you
again
lunch
with
us
instead
laughed
daphne
i
am
sure
that
i
will
said
roland
after
a
little
we
sauntered
back
to
our
bank
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
to
five
by
the
time
we
were
home
that
was
early
enough
but
the
girls
had
grown
tired
of
standing
and
we
had
seen
roland
win
twice
jonah
we
had
left
to
come
in
another
car
this
was
because
he
had
found
a
when
last
we
saw
him
he
had
a
pipe
in
one
hand
a
lighted
match
in
the
other
and
was
discussing
casts
falcon
met
us
at
the
door
with
a
telegram
addressed
to
mansel
the
wording
was
short
and
to
the
point
met
with
accident
can
you
come
piers
the
next
train
to
paris
left
pau
in
twelve
minutes
time
adèle
and
a
jill
caught
it
by
the
skin
of
their
teeth
they
had
their
tickets
the
clothes
they
stood
up
in
a
brace
of
vanity
bags
and
one
hundred
and
francs
but
that
was
all
it
was
arranged
feverishly
upon
the
platform
that
jonah
and
i
should
follow
with
such
of
their
effects
as
daphne
gave
us
by
the
train
then
a
horn
brayed
i
kissed
adèle
fingers
poor
jill
threw
me
a
ghost
of
a
smile
and
their
coach
rolled
slowly
out
of
the
station
i
returned
to
the
car
dazedly
thinking
it
over
i
decided
that
we
had
done
the
best
we
could
on
arrival
at
bordeaux
my
wife
and
cousin
could
join
the
spanish
express
which
was
due
to
leave
that
city
at
this
if
it
ran
to
time
would
bring
them
to
the
french
capital
by
seven
the
next
morning
jonah
and
i
would
arrive
some
five
hours
later
the
bank
was
closed
of
course
so
i
drove
to
the
club
forthwith
to
get
some
money
jonah
was
not
there
but
as
he
was
certain
to
call
i
left
a
note
with
the
porter
telling
him
what
had
occurred
then
i
purchased
our
tickets
a
lengthy
business
it
was
so
lengthy
in
fact
that
when
it
was
over
i
called
again
at
the
club
on
the
chance
of
picking
up
jonah
and
bringing
him
home
he
had
not
arrived
i
made
my
way
back
to
the
villa
dismally
enough
my
sister
and
berry
were
in
the
as
i
opened
the
door
wherever
have
you
been
said
daphne
did
they
catch
it
i
nodded
you
have
seen
jonah
i
suppose
i
shook
my
head
but
where
have
you
been
boy
i
spread
out
my
hands
getting
money
and
tickets
you
know
their
idea
of
haste
but
plenty
of
time
worse
luck
i
added
bitterly
then
i
say
what
a
dreadful
business
i
sank
into
a
chair
what
on
earth
can
have
happened
berry
rose
and
walked
to
a
window
jill
face
he
said
slowly
jill
face
he
swung
round
and
flung
out
an
arm
she
looked
old
he
cried
jill
that
baby
looked
old
she
thought
it
was
a
wire
to
say
he
was
on
his
way
and
it
hit
her
between
the
eyes
like
the
kick
of
a
horse
shrunk
into
a
corner
of
her
chair
my
sister
stared
dully
before
her
he
must
be
bad
said
i
unless
he
was
bad
he
never
have
wired
like
that
if
piers
could
have
done
it
i
sure
he
have
tempered
the
wind
you
come
quoted
berry
and
threw
up
his
arms
daphne
began
to
cry
quietly
a
glance
at
the
showed
me
that
these
were
untouched
i
rang
the
bell
and
pleasantly
fresh
tea
was
brought
i
made
my
sister
drink
and
poured
some
for
berry
and
me
the
stimulant
did
us
all
good
by
common
consent
we
thrust
speculation
aside
and
made
what
arrangements
we
could
that
our
plans
for
returning
to
england
would
now
miscarry
seemed
highly
probable
at
last
my
sister
sighed
and
lay
back
in
her
chair
why
she
said
quietly
why
what
has
jill
done
to
earn
this
oh
i
know
it
no
good
questioning
fate
but
it
it
rather
hard
i
stepped
to
her
side
and
took
her
hand
in
mine
my
darling
i
said
do
let
make
the
worst
of
a
bad
business
the
going
heavy
i
know
but
it
idle
to
curse
the
jumps
before
we
seen
them
piers
did
send
that
wire
himself
that
goes
without
saying
he
probably
never
worded
it
i
know
that
as
broad
as
it
long
but
when
you
come
to
think
there
really
no
reason
on
earth
why
it
should
be
anything
more
than
a
broken
leg
there
was
a
dubious
silence
at
length
boy
perfectly
right
said
berry
jill
scared
stiff
naturally
as
for
us
we
rattled
without
good
reason
at
all
for
all
we
know
he
broke
off
to
listen
the
front
door
closed
with
a
crash
jonah
said
i
he
had
my
note
and
it
was
not
jonah
it
was
piers
duke
of
padua
who
burst
into
the
room
looking
extraordinarily
healthy
and
very
much
out
of
breath
we
stared
at
him
speechless
for
a
moment
he
stood
smiling
then
he
swept
daphne
a
bow
paris
to
pau
by
air
he
said
in
four
and
a
quarter
hours
think
of
it
clean
across
france
in
a
bit
of
an
afternoon
you
all
to
do
it
it
simply
glorious
he
crossed
to
my
sister
side
and
kissed
her
hand
do
look
so
surprised
he
said
laughing
it
really
is
me
i
did
dare
to
wire
in
case
we
broke
down
on
the
way
and
now
where
jill
we
continued
to
stare
at
him
in
silence
it
was
berry
some
ten
minutes
later
who
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
by
george
he
shouted
by
george
i
got
it
in
one
fellow
who
sent
that
wire
was
leslie
cried
piers
but
why
who
knows
but
your
cousin
a
desperate
man
and
jill
in
his
way
so
are
you
more
still
but
short
of
murder
itself
to
touch
you
help
his
case
with
jill
in
his
hands
well
for
one
thing
only
i
take
it
you
pay
pretty
high
for
her
her
health
piers
went
very
white
for
myself
i
strove
to
keep
my
brain
steady
but
the
thought
of
adèle
my
wife
in
the
power
of
the
dog
would
thrust
itself
grinning
horribly
into
the
foreground
of
my
imagination
i
heard
somebody
say
that
the
hour
was
a
quarter
past
seven
i
had
my
watch
in
my
hand
so
i
knew
they
were
right
vainly
they
repeated
their
statement
unconsciously
voicing
my
thoughts
only
when
daphne
fell
on
her
knees
by
my
side
did
i
realise
that
i
was
the
speaker
berry
and
piers
were
at
the
telephone
i
heard
them
ask
for
the
bordeaux
exchange
burn
it
why
ca
i
talk
french
do
as
i
say
lad
do
argue
ask
for
the
bordeaux
exchange
insist
that
it
urgent
a
matter
of
life
and
death
piers
began
to
speak
shakily
yes
the
bordeaux
exchange
it
most
urgent
a
matter
of
life
and
death
yes
yes
the
exchange
itself
what
my
god
but
a
sudden
rude
thresh
of
the
bell
announced
that
his
call
was
over
berry
fell
upon
the
instrument
with
an
oath
it
no
good
cried
piers
it
no
good
she
says
the
line
to
bordeaux
is
out
of
order
my
sister
lifted
her
head
and
looked
into
my
face
can
you
do
it
by
car
she
said
i
pulled
myself
together
and
thought
very
fast
we
can
try
i
said
rising
but
oh
it
a
hopeless
chance
only
three
hours
three
hours
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
it
ca
be
done
we
have
to
do
over
seventy
most
of
the
way
and
you
ca
beat
a
pace
like
that
out
of
ping
and
pong
on
the
track
perhaps
but
on
the
open
road
the
soft
slush
of
tires
upon
the
drive
cut
short
my
sentence
jonah
at
last
breathed
daphne
we
ran
to
the
window
it
was
not
jonah
it
was
roland
so
soon
as
he
saw
us
he
stopped
and
threw
out
his
clutch
i
say
you
know
i
am
mos
distress
about
your
lunch
when
you
ask
me
roland
i
cried
roland
will
you
lend
me
your
car
but
i
not
said
now
at
once
here
to
drive
to
bordeaux
roland
looked
up
at
my
face
the
next
moment
he
was
out
of
his
seat
yes
but
i
am
not
going
with
you
he
said
then
what
is
the
matter
never
mind
you
will
tell
me
after
the
lights
are
good
and
she
is
full
up
with
gasolene
i
tell
you
you
will
be
there
in
three
hours
make
it
two
and
said
i
the
day
traffic
had
dwindled
to
a
handful
of
gigs
and
as
we
swung
out
of
the
and
on
to
the
bordeaux
road
a
distant
solitary
tram
was
the
only
vehicle
within
sight
i
settled
down
in
my
seat
a
moment
later
we
had
passed
the
and
pau
was
behind
us
piers
crouched
beside
me
as
though
he
were
carved
of
stone
once
in
a
while
his
eyes
would
fall
from
the
road
to
the
except
for
that
regular
movement
he
gave
no
sign
of
life
as
for
berry
sunk
in
the
chauffeur
cockpit
in
rear
i
hoped
that
his
airman
cap
would
stand
him
in
stead
the
light
was
good
and
would
serve
us
for
half
an
hour
the
car
was
pulling
like
the
mares
of
diomedes
as
we
flung
by
the
last
of
the
villas
i
gave
her
her
head
instantly
the
long
straight
road
presented
a
bend
and
i
eased
her
up
with
a
frown
we
took
the
corner
at
fifty
the
car
holding
the
road
as
though
this
were
banked
for
speed
as
we
flashed
by
the
desolate
and
the
ground
on
which
piers
had
alighted
two
hours
before
i
lifted
a
grateful
head
it
was
clear
that
what
corners
we
met
could
be
counted
out
with
such
a
grip
of
the
road
and
such
acceleration
the
time
which
anything
short
of
a
hairpin
bend
would
cost
us
was
almost
negligible
as
if
annoyed
at
my
finding
the
road
for
the
next
five
miles
ran
straight
as
a
die
for
over
three
of
those
miles
the
lady
whose
lap
we
sat
in
was
moving
at
a
hill
appeared
a
long
long
hill
steep
straight
yellow
tearing
towards
us
we
climbed
with
the
rush
of
a
lift
too
fast
for
our
stomachs
the
road
was
improving
now
but
as
if
to
cancel
this
a
steep
winding
hill
fell
into
a
sudden
valley
as
we
were
dropping
i
saw
its
fellow
upon
the
opposite
side
dragging
his
tedious
way
to
the
height
we
had
left
we
lost
time
badly
here
for
down
on
the
flat
of
the
dale
a
giant
lorry
was
turning
while
a
waggon
was
creeping
by
for
a
quarter
of
a
precious
minute
the
road
was
entirely
blocked
because
of
the
coming
ascent
the
check
hit
us
hard
in
a
word
it
made
a
mountain
out
of
a
molehill
what
the
car
might
have
swallowed
whole
she
had
to
masticate
she
ate
her
way
up
the
rise
snorting
with
indignation
a
mile
or
a
minute
sirs
whichever
you
please
was
all
the
grace
she
had
to
find
her
temper
then
the
deuce
of
a
hill
swerved
down
to
the
foot
of
another
long
blind
sinuous
the
road
was
writhing
like
a
serpent
we
used
it
as
serpents
should
be
used
maybe
it
bruised
our
heels
we
bruised
its
head
savagely
we
were
on
the
level
now
and
the
way
was
straight
again
a
dot
ahead
was
a
waggon
i
wondered
which
way
it
was
going
i
saw
and
we
passed
it
by
in
the
same
single
moment
of
time
that
i
may
not
be
thought
inobservant
yards
a
second
is
a
pace
which
embarrasses
sight
a
car
came
flying
towards
us
at
the
last
i
remarked
with
a
smile
it
was
going
our
way
a
flash
of
paint
a
smack
like
the
flap
of
a
sail
and
we
were
by
a
farm
was
coming
i
saw
the
white
of
its
walls
swelling
to
ells
from
inches
i
saw
a
hen
who
had
seen
us
starting
to
cross
our
path
simultaneously
i
lamented
her
death
needlessly
she
missed
destruction
by
yards
i
found
myself
wondering
whether
after
all
she
had
held
on
her
way
presently
i
decided
that
she
had
and
anxious
to
retrace
her
steps
had
probably
awaited
our
passage
in
some
annoyance
we
swam
up
another
hill
flicked
between
two
waggons
slashed
a
village
in
half
and
tore
up
the
open
road
the
daylight
was
waning
now
and
piers
switched
on
the
hooded
light
that
illumined
the
with
a
frown
i
collected
my
lady
for
one
last
tremendous
effort
before
the
darkness
fell
she
responded
like
the
thoroughbred
she
was
i
dared
not
glance
at
the
speedometer
but
i
could
feel
each
mile
as
it
added
itself
to
our
pace
i
felt
this
climb
from
ninety
to
thickening
the
spark
by
a
fraction
i
brought
it
to
in
a
quiet
steady
voice
piers
began
to
give
me
the
benefit
of
his
sight
something
ahead
on
the
right
a
waggon
all
clear
cart
i
think
on
the
right
no
yes
it
not
moving
a
bicycle
on
the
left
and
another
a
car
coming
all
clear
no
a
man
walking
on
the
right
all
clear
so
our
narrowed
eyes
nailed
to
the
straight
grey
ribbon
streaming
into
the
distance
the
sea
and
the
waves
roaring
in
our
ears
folded
in
the
wings
of
the
wind
we
cheated
dusk
of
seven
breathless
miles
and
sent
nature
packing
with
a
fork
in
her
breech
sore
at
this
treatment
the
dame
as
ever
returned
with
night
himself
to
urge
her
argument
i
threw
in
my
hand
with
a
sigh
and
piers
switched
on
the
lights
as
we
ran
into
i
heard
a
clock
striking
as
we
swung
to
the
left
in
the
town
eight
two
more
hours
and
a
quarter
and
a
hundred
and
nineteen
miles
to
go
i
tried
not
to
lose
heart
we
had
passed
and
were
nearing
i
knew
when
piers
forestalled
my
inquiry
and
spoke
in
my
ear
which
shall
you
do
go
straight
or
take
the
forest
road
i
do
know
the
roquefort
way
except
that
there
pavement
there
what
it
like
it
pretty
bad
said
piers
but
you
save
about
fifteen
miles
how
much
pavement
is
there
five
or
six
miles
thirty
about
said
piers
thanks
very
much
said
i
we
go
by
the
forest
i
think
i
was
right
i
knew
the
forest
road
and
i
knew
its
surface
was
superb
thirty
miles
of
pavement
which
i
did
not
know
which
was
admittedly
rough
presented
a
ghastly
prospect
the
tax
of
fifteen
precious
miles
tacked
on
to
the
way
of
the
forest
was
really
frightening
but
since
such
a
little
matter
as
a
broken
lamp
would
kill
our
chances
i
dared
not
risk
the
rough
and
tumble
of
the
pavement
upon
the
roquefort
road
at
last
the
came
and
we
swung
to
the
right
we
had
covered
a
third
of
the
ground
i
glanced
at
the
gleaming
clock
sunk
in
the
dash
minutes
past
eight
an
hour
and
fifty
minutes
and
a
hundred
miles
to
go
with
a
frightful
shock
i
realised
that
with
the
daylight
to
help
me
i
had
used
a
third
of
my
i
began
to
wish
frantically
that
i
had
gone
by
roquefort
i
felt
a
wild
inclination
to
stop
and
retrace
my
steps
pavement
pavement
be
burned
i
must
have
been
mad
to
throw
away
fifteen
miles
fifteen
golden
miles
adèle
face
pale
frightened
accusing
stared
at
me
through
the
over
her
shoulder
jill
white
and
shrinking
pointed
a
shaking
finger
with
a
groan
i
jammed
my
foot
on
the
accelerator
with
a
roar
the
car
sprang
forward
like
a
spurred
horse
heaven
knows
the
speed
at
which
justin
was
passed
i
was
beyond
caring
we
missed
a
figure
by
inches
and
a
cart
by
a
foot
then
the
cottages
faded
and
the
long
snarl
of
the
engine
sank
to
the
stormy
mutter
she
kept
for
the
open
road
we
were
in
the
forest
now
and
i
let
her
go
out
of
the
memories
of
that
april
evening
our
progress
through
the
forest
stands
like
a
chapter
of
a
dream
below
us
the
tapering
road
paler
than
ever
on
either
side
an
endless
army
of
fir
trees
towering
shoulder
to
shoulder
so
dark
so
vast
and
standing
still
as
death
above
us
a
lane
of
violet
all
pricked
with
burning
stars
we
supped
the
rare
old
ale
brewed
by
hans
andersen
himself
within
this
magic
zone
the
throb
of
the
engine
the
hiss
of
the
carburettor
the
swift
brush
of
the
tires
upon
the
road
three
rousing
tones
yielding
a
thunderous
chord
were
curiously
staccato
the
velvet
veil
of
silence
we
rent
in
twain
but
as
we
tore
it
the
folds
fell
back
to
hang
like
mighty
curtains
about
our
path
stifling
all
echo
striking
reverberation
dumb
the
strong
sweet
smell
of
the
woods
enhanced
the
mystery
the
cool
clean
air
thrashed
us
with
perfume
the
lights
of
the
car
were
powerful
and
focussed
perfectly
the
steady
bright
splash
upon
the
road
one
hundred
yards
ahead
robbed
the
night
of
its
sting
rabbits
rocketed
across
our
bows
a
bat
spilled
its
brains
upon
our
a
hare
led
us
for
an
instant
only
to
flash
to
safety
under
our
very
wheels
as
for
the
moths
the
screen
was
strewn
with
the
dead
three
times
piers
had
to
rise
and
wipe
it
clear
of
men
and
beasts
mercifully
we
saw
no
sign
if
houeilles
knew
of
our
passage
her
ears
told
her
seemingly
the
hamlet
slept
i
doubt
if
we
took
four
seconds
to
thread
its
one
straight
street
next
day
i
suppose
men
swore
the
devil
was
loose
they
may
be
forgiven
looking
back
from
a
hazy
distance
i
think
he
was
at
my
arm
as
we
ran
into
casteljaloux
a
clock
was
striking
nine
we
had
covered
the
miles
in
minutes
dead
to
the
left
you
know
said
piers
i
cried
setting
a
foot
on
the
brake
straight
on
surely
we
turn
to
the
left
at
marmande
no
no
we
do
touch
marmande
we
turn
to
the
left
here
i
swung
round
obediently
this
is
the
langon
road
it
quite
all
right
and
it
saves
us
about
ten
miles
ten
miles
i
could
have
screamed
for
joy
only
miles
to
go
and
an
hour
and
a
quarter
left
the
hope
which
had
never
died
lifted
up
its
head
it
was
when
we
were
nearing
auros
that
we
sighted
the
van
this
was
a
hooded
horror
a
great
affair
a
creature
i
imagine
of
bordeaux
blinding
home
like
a
mad
thing
instead
of
blundering
ah
i
see
a
hundred
fingers
pointing
to
the
beam
in
my
eye
bear
with
me
gentlemen
i
am
not
so
sightless
as
all
that
i
could
steer
my
car
with
two
fingers
upon
the
roughest
road
i
could
bring
her
up
all
standing
in
twice
her
length
my
lights
as
you
know
made
darkness
a
thing
of
nought
i
can
not
answer
for
its
headlights
nor
for
its
but
the
backlash
in
the
steering
of
that
van
was
terrible
to
behold
hurling
itself
along
at
thirty
odd
miles
an
hour
the
vehicle
rocked
and
swung
all
over
the
narrow
surface
now
lurching
to
the
right
now
plunging
to
the
left
but
in
the
main
holding
a
wobbling
course
upon
the
crown
of
the
road
to
my
distraction
here
was
trouble
enough
but
what
was
worse
upon
my
sounding
the
horn
the
driver
refused
to
give
way
he
knew
of
my
presence
of
course
he
heard
me
he
saw
my
headlights
and
he
sought
to
increase
his
pace
i
sounded
the
horn
till
it
failed
i
yelled
till
my
throat
was
sore
piers
raged
and
howled
behind
i
heard
berry
bellowing
like
a
fiend
i
cursed
and
chafed
till
the
sweat
of
baffled
fury
ran
into
my
eyes
for
over
five
hideous
miles
i
followed
that
bucketing
van
i
tried
to
pass
it
once
but
the
brute
who
was
driving
swerved
to
the
left
i
believe
on
purpose
and
only
our
brakes
averted
a
headline
smash
at
that
moment
we
might
not
have
been
on
earth
my
lady
stopped
as
a
bird
stops
in
its
flight
with
the
sudden
heave
of
a
ship
she
seemed
to
hang
in
the
air
wild
as
i
was
i
could
not
but
marvel
at
her
grace
out
of
the
check
came
wisdom
it
was
safe
then
to
keep
very
close
i
crept
to
the
blackguard
heels
till
our
headlights
made
two
rings
upon
his
vile
body
with
one
foot
on
the
step
piers
hung
out
of
the
car
watching
the
road
beyond
suddenly
the
van
tilted
to
the
right
i
knew
a
swerve
must
follow
if
the
driver
would
keep
his
balance
as
it
came
i
pulled
out
and
crammed
by
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
a
glance
at
the
clock
made
me
feel
sick
to
death
fifteen
priceless
minutes
that
van
had
stolen
out
of
my
hoard
i
had
risked
our
lives
a
score
of
times
to
win
each
one
of
them
and
now
an
churl
had
flung
them
into
the
draught
i
set
my
teeth
and
put
the
car
at
a
hill
at
we
flashed
through
langon
at
twenty
minutes
to
ten
minutes
left
and
thirty
miles
to
go
we
were
on
the
main
road
now
and
the
surface
was
wide
if
rough
what
little
traffic
there
was
left
plenty
of
room
i
took
the
ashes
of
my
caution
and
flung
them
to
the
winds
piers
told
me
afterwards
that
for
the
first
twenty
miles
never
once
did
the
speedometer
needle
fall
below
he
may
be
right
i
knew
that
the
streets
were
coming
and
the
station
had
to
be
found
it
was
a
question
in
fact
of
stealing
time
that
which
we
had
already
was
not
enough
unless
we
could
pick
some
out
of
the
pocket
of
providence
the
game
was
up
i
had
to
slow
down
at
last
for
a
parcel
of
stones
the
road
was
being
and
thirty
yards
of
rubble
had
to
be
delicately
trod
as
we
forged
through
the
ruck
at
twenty
piers
stared
at
the
side
of
the
road
bordeaux
he
quoted
ten
more
miles
and
nineteen
minutes
to
go
the
traffic
was
growing
now
with
every
furlong
belated
lorries
rumbled
about
their
business
cars
panted
and
raved
into
the
night
carts
jolted
out
of
turnings
into
the
great
main
road
when
i
think
of
the
chances
i
took
the
palms
of
my
hands
grow
hot
to
wait
for
others
to
grant
my
request
for
room
was
out
of
the
question
i
said
i
was
coming
i
came
and
that
was
that
times
out
of
number
i
overtook
vehicles
upon
the
wrong
side
as
for
the
frequent
turnings
i
hoped
for
the
best
once
where
four
ways
met
i
thought
we
were
done
a
car
was
coming
across
i
could
see
its
headlights
beam
i
opened
the
throttle
wide
and
we
raced
for
the
closing
gap
as
we
came
to
the
cross
of
the
roads
i
heard
an
engine
roar
for
an
instant
a
searchlight
raked
us
there
was
a
cry
from
berry
an
answering
shout
the
noise
of
tires
tearing
at
the
road
and
that
was
all
a
moment
later
i
was
picking
my
way
between
two
labouring
waggons
and
a
trio
of
straggling
carts
bordeaux
quoted
piers
five
more
miles
and
eleven
minutes
to
go
piers
had
the
plan
of
the
city
upon
his
knees
he
conned
it
as
best
he
could
by
the
glow
of
the
hooded
light
after
a
moment
or
two
he
thrust
the
book
away
the
station
this
end
of
the
town
we
ca
miss
it
i
tell
you
when
to
turn
three
minutes
more
and
our
road
had
become
a
street
two
parallel
glittering
lines
warned
me
of
trams
to
come
as
if
to
confirm
their
news
a
red
orb
in
the
distance
was
eyeing
us
angrily
we
turn
to
the
right
said
piers
i
tell
you
when
i
glanced
at
the
clock
the
hour
was
nine
minutes
past
ten
my
teeth
began
to
chatter
of
sheer
excitement
there
was
a
turning
ahead
and
i
glanced
at
piers
not
yet
he
said
with
a
frantic
eye
on
the
clock
i
thrust
up
that
awful
road
the
traffic
seemed
to
combine
to
cramp
my
style
i
swerved
i
cut
in
i
stole
an
odd
yard
i
shouldered
other
drivers
aside
and
once
confronted
with
a
block
i
whipped
on
to
the
broad
pavement
and
amid
scandalised
shouts
left
the
obstruction
to
stay
less
urgent
business
all
the
time
i
could
see
the
relentless
beating
me
on
the
post
at
last
piers
gave
the
word
and
i
switched
to
the
right
the
boulevard
was
empty
we
just
swept
up
it
like
a
black
squall
left
and
right
then
and
we
entered
the
straight
with
thirty
seconds
to
go
some
way
up
breathed
piers
i
set
my
teeth
hard
and
let
my
lady
out
by
the
time
i
had
sighted
the
station
the
speedometer
needle
had
swung
to
i
ran
alongside
the
pavement
clapped
on
the
brakes
threw
out
the
clutch
piers
switched
off
and
we
flung
ourselves
out
of
the
car
stiff
as
a
sleepy
hare
i
stumbled
into
the
hall
train
pour
paris
i
shouted
est
le
train
pour
paris
this
way
cried
piers
passing
me
like
a
stag
i
continued
to
shout
ridiculously
running
behind
him
i
saw
him
come
to
a
barrier
ask
and
be
answered
try
to
push
through
the
officials
sought
to
detain
him
a
whistle
screamed
with
a
roar
i
flung
aside
the
protesting
arms
and
carrying
piers
with
me
floundered
on
to
the
platform
a
train
was
moving
feeling
curiously
i
got
carefully
upon
the
step
of
a
passing
coach
piers
stepped
on
behind
me
and
thrust
me
up
to
the
door
then
a
conductor
came
and
hauled
us
inside
i
opened
my
eyes
to
see
adèle
face
six
inches
away
better
old
chap
she
said
gently
i
tried
to
sit
up
but
she
set
a
hand
upon
my
chest
do
say
i
fainted
i
said
she
smiled
and
nodded
but
i
understand
she
said
that
you
have
a
wonderful
excuse
not
for
said
i
of
course
we
did
hurry
but
piers
burst
in
excitedly
there
is
another
driver
in
all
rot
said
i
jonah
would
have
done
it
with
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
spare
so
he
would
my
cousin
would
have
walked
to
the
train
and
had
a
drink
into
the
bargain
while
the
train
thundered
northward
through
a
drowsy
world
a
council
of
five
sat
up
in
a
and
laid
its
plans
by
far
its
most
valuable
member
was
señor
don
fedriani
travelling
by
chance
from
biarritz
to
the
french
capital
it
was
indeed
in
response
to
his
telegram
from
poitiers
that
a
few
minutes
before
seven
the
next
morning
two
detectives
boarded
our
train
at
the
five
minutes
later
we
steamed
into
the
jill
carefully
primed
was
the
first
to
alight
except
for
piers
duke
of
padua
the
rest
of
us
followed
as
ordinary
passengers
would
it
was
of
course
plain
that
we
had
no
connection
with
jill
that
leslie
trunk
should
meet
her
himself
was
quite
in
order
that
having
thus
put
his
neck
into
the
noose
he
should
proceed
to
adjust
the
rope
about
his
argued
an
unexpected
generosity
he
had
sent
the
wire
he
had
taken
that
responsibility
how
was
piers
well
there
was
plenty
of
hope
he
patted
her
delicate
hand
must
be
brave
of
course
yes
he
had
just
left
him
he
was
in
a
crazy
to
see
her
they
would
go
there
at
once
we
all
went
at
once
including
piers
duke
of
padua
leslie
trunk
señor
don
fedriani
and
the
two
shared
the
same
taxi
we
were
joined
by
trunk
the
meeting
was
not
cordial
neither
was
the
house
a
i
do
not
know
what
it
was
a
glance
at
the
proportions
of
the
blackamoor
who
opened
the
door
suggested
that
it
was
a
bastile
it
was
thirty
hours
later
that
berry
pushed
back
his
chair
it
was
a
glorious
day
and
viewed
from
the
verandah
of
the
that
smiling
pleasaunce
the
rolling
plain
of
billère
was
beckoning
more
genially
than
ever
so
soon
as
our
luncheon
had
settled
we
were
to
prove
its
promise
for
the
last
time
yes
said
berry
puerile
as
it
may
seem
i
assumed
you
were
coming
back
my
assumption
was
so
definite
that
i
did
even
get
out
for
one
thing
death
seemed
very
near
and
the
close
similarity
which
the
slot
i
was
occupying
bore
to
a
coffin
had
all
along
been
too
suggestive
to
be
ignored
secondly
from
my
coign
of
vantage
i
had
a
most
lovely
view
of
the
pavement
outside
the
station
i
never
remember
refuse
looking
so
superb
well
i
do
know
how
long
i
waited
but
when
it
seemed
certain
that
you
were
er
detained
i
emerged
from
my
shell
i
did
like
leaving
the
car
unattended
but
as
there
was
a
lock
i
did
know
what
to
do
then
i
remembered
that
just
as
the
beaver
when
pursued
jettisons
some
one
of
its
organs
i
forget
which
and
thus
evades
capture
so
the
careful
mechanic
removes
some
vital
portion
of
his
engine
to
thwart
the
unauthorised
i
had
a
vague
idea
that
the
part
in
question
was
of
with
or
from
the
magneto
i
had
not
even
a
vague
idea
that
the
latter
was
protected
by
a
network
of
live
wires
and
that
one
had
only
to
stretch
out
one
finger
to
induce
a
spark
about
a
foot
long
and
a
shock
from
which
one
will
never
wholly
recover
i
reeled
into
the
station
hoping
against
hope
that
somebody
be
fool
enough
to
steal
the
swine
yes
the
buffet
was
closed
of
such
is
the
city
of
bordeaux
when
i
recovered
consciousness
i
sought
for
you
two
i
asked
several
officials
if
they
had
seen
two
gentlemen
some
walked
away
as
if
nettled
others
adopted
the
soothing
attitude
one
keeps
for
the
inebriated
upon
reflection
i
do
blame
them
i
had
a
weak
case
at
last
i
returned
to
the
car
alas
it
was
still
there
i
then
had
recourse
to
what
is
known
as
process
of
exhaustion
in
fact
i
found
it
extremely
useful
by
means
of
that
process
i
was
eventually
successful
in
starting
the
engine
and
in
the
same
elementary
way
i
got
into
top
gear
i
drew
out
of
that
yard
with
a
running
backfire
nearly
blowing
me
out
of
my
seat
well
the
general
idea
was
to
find
a
garage
the
special
one
was
to
hear
what
people
said
when
i
stopped
to
ask
them
the
way
the
fourth
one
i
asked
was
a
chauffeur
under
his
direction
one
first
of
all
reduced
the
blinding
stammer
of
the
exhaust
to
an
impressive
but
respectable
roar
and
then
proceeded
in
his
company
to
a
dairy
a
garage
another
dairy
and
a
hotel
in
that
order
i
gave
that
chap
a
skinful
and
fifty
francs
yesterday
i
drove
home
i
can
prove
it
all
through
the
trams
like
a
i
admit
i
took
over
six
hours
but
i
lunched
on
the
way
i
trust
that
two
of
the
poultry
i
met
are
now
in
paradise
indeed
i
see
no
reason
to
suspect
the
contrary
so
far
as
i
could
observe
they
looked
good
upright
fowls
and
i
look
forward
confidently
to
an
opportunity
of
apologising
to
them
for
their
untimely
translation
they
were
running
it
rather
fine
and
out
of
pure
courtesy
i
set
my
foot
positively
upon
the
brake
unfortunately
it
was
the
brake
but
the
accelerator
my
recollection
of
the
next
forty
seconds
is
more
than
hazy
there
is
so
to
speak
a
hiatus
in
my
memory
some
two
miles
long
this
was
partly
due
to
the
force
with
which
the
back
of
the
front
seat
hit
me
in
the
small
of
the
back
talk
about
a
blue
streak
oh
it
a
marvellous
machine
very
quick
in
the
uptake
give
her
an
inch
and
she
take
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
stopping
however
have
you
seen
roland
i
said
yes
he
dined
last
night
i
told
him
you
broken
down
his
beauty
and
that
i
had
administered
the

he
quite
believed
it
what
did

say
said
adèle
since
you
ask
me
said
berry
i
give
you
his
very
words
i
think
you
value
them
tell
you
he
said
am
very
proud
you
say
she
is
done
well
then
there
are
other
cars
in
the
but
she
has
saved
something
which
no
one
can
buy
in
the
world
